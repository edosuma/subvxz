WEBVTT

00:01.031 --> 00:02.359
I respect LeBron James,

00:02.531 --> 00:03.742
I admire LeBron James.

00:03.766 --> 00:06.078
But compared to Michael Jordan? Come on.

00:06.132 --> 00:07.241
You only think that

00:07.266 --> 00:09.134
because you're a Chicago chauvinist.

00:09.168 --> 00:11.436
Oh, no. No, I'm completely objective.

00:11.470 --> 00:14.105
Stats, clutch playing,
it's Jordan all the way.

00:14.140 --> 00:16.107
Will, you are a very good doctor,

00:16.149 --> 00:18.636
but very limited on your
understanding of basketball.

00:18.661 --> 00:20.128
Give me a kiss.

00:20.363 --> 00:21.980
- Dr. Manning, radiology called.
- Yes?

00:22.014 --> 00:23.793
Your scans are up on the computer.

00:23.818 --> 00:24.883
- Okay.
- I got it.

00:24.917 --> 00:26.184
Thank you.

00:27.620 --> 00:30.059
- Morning, Connor.
- Good morning, Will.

00:30.181 --> 00:32.950
- Hey, how's Robin?
- She's much better, thanks.

00:33.002 --> 00:34.845
Yeah, she's shopping like a fiend.

00:34.885 --> 00:36.803
She left me about a foot
of space in the closet,

00:36.847 --> 00:39.515
- and three hangers.
- Uh-oh.

00:39.550 --> 00:41.951
Excuse me.

00:41.985 --> 00:43.586
- Maggie.
- Yeah?

00:43.620 --> 00:45.288
Do me a favor. Call CT,
tell them I had to leave.

00:45.322 --> 00:46.789
I'll be back as soon as I can.

00:46.823 --> 00:49.025
You got it.

01:15.719 --> 01:17.453
Hey, Darren.

01:17.487 --> 01:19.121
- Sorry about this, Dr. Rhodes.
- No, I appreciate the text.

01:19.156 --> 01:20.289
- Where is she?
- This way.

01:20.324 --> 01:21.524
Okay.

01:21.558 --> 01:23.492
One of my guys caught her
trying to walk out with this.

01:23.527 --> 01:25.294
Had no idea who she was.

01:25.329 --> 01:27.330
We would have called P.D.
if your dad hadn't been here.

01:27.364 --> 01:28.497
Appreciate that.

01:29.833 --> 01:31.300
Did you really have to lock her in?

01:31.335 --> 01:33.235
Standard procedure, Dr. Rhodes.

01:39.509 --> 01:41.344
Robin.

01:43.547 --> 01:46.048
I don't know what's the matter with me.

01:46.083 --> 01:47.984
Shh, come here, come here.

01:48.018 --> 01:50.920
It's gonna be all right, honey.

01:50.954 --> 01:53.022
It's gonna be all right.

01:58.929 --> 02:00.896
I hear Mama hollering from the bathroom

02:00.931 --> 02:02.698
and I run in and find her on the floor.

02:02.733 --> 02:04.166
That's when I called 911.

02:04.201 --> 02:06.435
Told her a bus would suit me just fine,

02:06.470 --> 02:09.104
instead of wasting all
that money on a ambulance.

02:09.139 --> 02:11.674
Well, I'm glad you did
decide to come in, Ms. Buckley.

02:11.708 --> 02:13.542
Luckily, it's only
your wrist that's broken,

02:13.577 --> 02:16.946
but your X-ray shows what
we call a Colles' fracture.

02:16.980 --> 02:18.881
So we need to reduce it,
re-align your bones,

02:18.915 --> 02:20.850
and then we can put you in a splint.

02:20.884 --> 02:22.551
If you say so.

02:22.586 --> 02:25.554
Okay. April, draw up
10 milligrams of lidocaine

02:25.589 --> 02:27.123
for a hematoma block.

02:27.157 --> 02:29.759
So, let me guess. Virginia?

02:29.793 --> 02:31.694
- North Carolina.
- Mm.

02:31.728 --> 02:34.964
We've been here 20 years.
Guess the Tar Heel never goes.

02:38.235 --> 02:43.072
- You all right?
- Yeah, it's nothing.

02:43.106 --> 02:44.940
Okay, now this is gonna hurt.

02:44.975 --> 02:47.910
So I'm gonna have you take
some deep breaths for me, okay?

02:47.944 --> 02:49.311
- All right, you ready?
- Mm-hmm.

02:49.346 --> 02:51.213
Okay, take a deep breath.

02:51.248 --> 02:52.715
Good job. Now I'm gonna have you

02:52.749 --> 02:56.218
take one more really big
deep breath for me, okay?

02:56.253 --> 02:58.888
Ready? One, two, three.

02:58.922 --> 03:01.490
Ah!

03:01.525 --> 03:03.959
All right, the hard part's over.

03:03.994 --> 03:06.162
Great job.

03:06.196 --> 03:08.164
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

03:08.198 --> 03:09.832
Orthopedics will be down later

03:09.866 --> 03:12.635
to set you up with a cast, okay?

03:14.538 --> 03:17.740
- Thank you.
- Sorry. Thank you.

03:17.774 --> 03:19.675
How's Noah doing?

03:19.710 --> 03:22.344
He's gonna have a black eye
for a couple days,

03:22.379 --> 03:25.414
but he'll be okay.
He'll be in later today.

03:25.449 --> 03:28.284
Glad to hear it.

03:29.953 --> 03:31.687
Honey, this is the encephalitis.

03:31.722 --> 03:33.422
This isn't you.

03:33.457 --> 03:36.258
You don't know how it feels.
It is humiliating.

03:36.293 --> 03:38.594
Things like this, they're gonna pass.

03:38.628 --> 03:40.696
You know that.

03:40.731 --> 03:43.132
You're already better
than you were a month ago.

03:43.166 --> 03:44.767
Am I though?

03:44.801 --> 03:47.002
Really?

03:47.037 --> 03:50.272
God, I've got to pull myself together.

03:54.745 --> 03:56.345
Dad.

03:56.379 --> 03:58.280
Thank you for not calling the cops.

03:58.315 --> 04:02.451
Connor, this friend of yours,
she's a kleptomaniac.

04:02.486 --> 04:03.519
No, she isn't.

04:03.553 --> 04:05.454
She's recovering from
an illness that makes her

04:05.489 --> 04:07.456
do things she wouldn't otherwise do.

04:07.491 --> 04:10.871
Well, still, you have to
admit she's unstable.

04:10.895 --> 04:11.924
You don't know her.

04:11.949 --> 04:13.863
You don't know anything about her.

04:13.897 --> 04:16.173
So what she did was sane, reasonable?

04:16.197 --> 04:17.290
After what happened to Mom,

04:17.315 --> 04:18.801
I would say that you are the last person

04:18.834 --> 04:20.469
that should be discussing
anybody's mental health.

04:20.504 --> 04:21.821
- You're making this about your mother?
- Yes, I am.

04:21.846 --> 04:23.829
She's been gone for 20 years.

04:24.390 --> 04:26.024
Time to move on, don't you think?

04:26.113 --> 04:29.916
Yeah, it took you what, a week?

04:30.013 --> 04:31.514
Okay, listen to me.

04:31.548 --> 04:36.318
If she's not unstable, she's a criminal.

04:36.353 --> 04:41.090
Either way, fatherly advice:

04:41.124 --> 04:43.058
Get rid of her.

05:01.945 --> 05:03.879
- Good morning.
- Morning.

05:03.914 --> 05:06.415
Hey, so you and April?

05:06.449 --> 05:07.583
Yeah.

05:07.617 --> 05:09.685
How long has that been going on?

05:09.719 --> 05:11.587
About six months.

05:11.621 --> 05:14.523
You managed to keep it quiet
for six months in this place?

05:14.558 --> 05:15.691
It wasn't easy.

05:15.725 --> 05:19.261
On several occasions, we came
close to blowing our cover.

05:22.232 --> 05:23.699
- Sharon?
- Yeah?

05:23.733 --> 05:25.601
I'm a charge nurse,
and I'm hanging IV bags.

05:25.635 --> 05:27.570
I know, Maggie. You're short staffed.

05:27.604 --> 05:29.872
For a month. When are we
gonna hire more nurses?

05:29.906 --> 05:31.907
We can't afford it.
It's not in the budget.

05:31.942 --> 05:34.877
Sharon, we are required to
have one nurse for two beds.

05:34.911 --> 05:38.781
That's 12 nurses per shift.
Four shifts, that's 48 nurses.

05:38.815 --> 05:40.249
Right now, I only have 42.

05:40.283 --> 05:42.084
Well, even it out with overtime.

05:42.118 --> 05:43.319
Time and a half?

05:43.353 --> 05:44.420
How is that supposed to save us money?

05:44.454 --> 05:45.588
It doesn't, but overtime

05:45.622 --> 05:47.289
comes out of a different account.

05:47.324 --> 05:49.158
We still look good. Work with me.

05:49.192 --> 05:52.595
Dr. Halstead, incoming.

05:52.629 --> 05:56.665
Arlo Littman, 20 years old.
Delusional and combative.

05:56.700 --> 05:57.800
Says he's radioactive.

05:57.834 --> 06:00.236
You can't let anyone
touch me, make them stay away!

06:00.270 --> 06:02.071
Negative on radiation poisoning.

06:02.105 --> 06:04.406
He hasn't vomited or been nauseated.

06:04.441 --> 06:06.809
Too agitated to get vitals,
restrained in the field.

06:06.843 --> 06:08.244
He on something?

06:08.278 --> 06:09.445
Roommate says no, he doesn't do drugs.

06:09.479 --> 06:11.247
No one touch me! No one touch me!

06:11.281 --> 06:12.748
Karen, page Psych.

06:12.782 --> 06:14.416
All right, let's get him on the bed.

06:14.451 --> 06:16.518
Arlo, I'm Dr. Halstead,
I'm gonna help you.

06:16.553 --> 06:18.320
I'm death, don't touch me.

06:18.355 --> 06:19.521
Yeah, let's get him on the bed.

06:19.556 --> 06:21.190
- Uh-huh.
- One, two, three.

06:21.224 --> 06:23.092
- Get away from me, no!
- Restraints.

06:23.126 --> 06:25.494
- Courtney, get his left leg.
- Yup.

06:25.528 --> 06:27.329
You'll die, you will all die!

06:27.364 --> 06:28.430
- All right.
- All right.

06:30.533 --> 06:33.002
Let's move him up a little bit.

06:33.036 --> 06:36.438
Spontaneous movement in all
four limbs, anyone disagree?

06:39.876 --> 06:42.177
Pupils equal, round and reactive.

06:42.212 --> 06:44.046
Don't touch me, save yourselves.

06:44.080 --> 06:45.948
- Hey!
- Okay, easy, buddy.

06:45.982 --> 06:47.283
Try and relax.

06:51.521 --> 06:53.489
Yeah, I didn't sedate him,
didn't want to over-snow him.

06:53.523 --> 06:54.957
Thought you'd want to hear his spiel.

06:54.991 --> 06:56.959
Five diazepam, five olanzapine.

06:56.993 --> 06:58.460
Got it.

06:58.495 --> 07:00.796
Hey, I'm Dr. Charles,
I'm here to help you.

07:00.830 --> 07:03.132
I'm death.

07:03.166 --> 07:05.067
Let's get him on the monitors.

07:05.101 --> 07:07.069
U-tox, blood alcohol, CBC and CMP.

07:07.103 --> 07:10.973
- You want the restraints off?
- Eh.

07:11.007 --> 07:12.808
Let's leave them on for now.

07:12.842 --> 07:14.476
See what his state of mind
is when he wakes up.

07:14.511 --> 07:16.078
All right, he's all yours.

07:16.112 --> 07:19.014
- Thanks, Will.
- Yup.

07:19.049 --> 07:21.483
Initial thoughts?

07:21.518 --> 07:23.719
Schizophrenia usually
manifests at his age.

07:23.753 --> 07:27.156
Mm-hm. Doris, could you give
us a second, please?

07:27.190 --> 07:28.857
Sure.

07:32.562 --> 07:34.396
- You okay?
- Yes.

07:34.431 --> 07:36.231
All right, just making sure

07:36.266 --> 07:38.000
you're comfortable treating the patient.

07:38.034 --> 07:39.535
Yeah, absolutely.

07:39.569 --> 07:42.905
I'll be here if you need me.

07:57.333 --> 07:59.036
Hey, you.

08:00.196 --> 08:01.818
I got to get back to work.

08:01.943 --> 08:05.213
Uh, there's leftovers
in the fridge, if you want.

08:05.284 --> 08:08.180
- Turkey, asparagus...
- I'm not hungry.

08:08.274 --> 08:12.111
Robin, you should eat.
You'd feel better.

08:14.514 --> 08:17.349
You take good care of me.

08:17.811 --> 08:19.952
I guess you do that
for all your patients.

08:19.986 --> 08:21.954
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey.

08:21.988 --> 08:25.518
You are not my patient.

08:26.059 --> 08:27.326
I love you.

08:27.909 --> 08:31.221
Do you? Because I wouldn't love me.

08:32.275 --> 08:34.399
I'd get rid of me.

08:39.443 --> 08:42.210
Listen, my dad is a son of a bitch.

08:43.100 --> 08:45.468
He likes to destroy things.

08:45.811 --> 08:48.480
And you, you like to fix things.

08:50.326 --> 08:53.677
People with blocked arteries

08:54.126 --> 08:56.418
or leaky valves.

08:57.520 --> 09:00.590
Unhinged girlfriends
who like to shoplift.

09:01.528 --> 09:03.539
Meaning?

09:03.807 --> 09:06.198
Wanting to save someone,

09:06.933 --> 09:09.065
needing to save someone,

09:10.721 --> 09:12.831
it's not the same as loving.

09:13.373 --> 09:17.915
Robin, your illness, it gives
you a distorted view of things.

09:17.946 --> 09:19.912
Right. Unhinged.

09:20.665 --> 09:22.540
No.

09:23.524 --> 09:26.470
It is a matter of brain chemistry.

09:26.735 --> 09:29.845
And obviously, right now it's
not being addressed properly.

09:29.892 --> 09:32.993
So I am going to make sure that it is.

09:33.493 --> 09:36.562
You're my knight in shining armor.

09:37.829 --> 09:40.131
I'll be home as soon as I can.

09:53.812 --> 09:56.080
- And this one too.
- Yep.

09:57.849 --> 09:59.617
Dr. Halstead, you're back on.

09:59.651 --> 10:01.552
You're going to treatment four.
Hey, Monique?

10:01.587 --> 10:02.954
Jessie Rowe, mid-twenties.

10:02.988 --> 10:04.422
Shortness of breath, abdominal pain.

10:04.456 --> 10:05.489
I'm her husband.

10:05.524 --> 10:06.891
Okay, I'm Dr. Halstead.

10:06.925 --> 10:08.626
Any idea what might be causing this?

10:08.660 --> 10:10.328
Something you ate? Did you fall?

10:10.362 --> 10:12.663
- No.
- Might be the IVF therapy.

10:12.698 --> 10:14.131
We've been trying to get pregnant,

10:14.166 --> 10:15.433
Jessie's had three rounds.

10:15.467 --> 10:17.301
Embryo transfer two weeks ago.

10:17.336 --> 10:19.470
Okay, let's see what's going on.

10:21.540 --> 10:23.474
- I'm hearing a slight crackle.
- I got it.

10:23.508 --> 10:24.976
- Pam, we need an X-ray in here.
- Yes, Maggie.

10:25.010 --> 10:27.144
How long you been feeling this way?

10:27.179 --> 10:28.746
Been bloated a couple days.

10:28.780 --> 10:30.815
Shortness of breath just this morning.

10:30.849 --> 10:35.152
Heart rate 86, BP 124/73.
02 sat's at 93%.

10:35.187 --> 10:37.855
That's a little low.
Put her on a nasal cannula.

10:37.889 --> 10:41.292
Jessie, I'm gonna ultrasound your belly.

10:41.326 --> 10:42.827
Thank you.

10:42.861 --> 10:44.528
Your ovaries are somewhat enlarged,

10:44.563 --> 10:46.430
but that can happen after IVF.

10:46.465 --> 10:48.666
Can you tell? Am I pregnant?

10:48.700 --> 10:50.501
Uh, too early for that to show.

10:50.535 --> 10:51.836
- We need a chest.
- Yes, doctor.

10:51.870 --> 10:53.838
Wait, what if she is pregnant?

10:53.872 --> 10:55.973
The lead apron will protect her.

10:56.008 --> 10:57.908
Stand back, everybody.

11:02.714 --> 11:04.682
I'm seeing some congestion in the lungs,

11:04.716 --> 11:06.550
but not enough to concern me.

11:06.585 --> 11:08.152
This could all just be
in response to the IVF,

11:08.186 --> 11:09.387
but we're gonna make sure.

11:09.421 --> 11:11.155
Hopefully you'll feel better soon.

11:11.189 --> 11:14.625
And we'll all cross our fingers
the embryo transfer took.

11:18.096 --> 11:21.465
Mr. Janichek, I'm Dr. Choi.
I understand you cut yourself.

11:21.500 --> 11:23.501
Yeah, and maybe someone
can finally tell me why.

11:23.535 --> 11:24.902
I see this isn't the first time.

11:24.936 --> 11:26.671
It's been happening a lot lately.

11:26.705 --> 11:28.639
I drop things, I fall down.
It's not like me.

11:28.674 --> 11:29.707
Basic vitals are all normal.

11:29.741 --> 11:31.409
You know, I don't care.

11:31.443 --> 11:34.645
Something's wrong with me,
and no one can figure out what.

11:34.680 --> 11:37.682
Well, let's take a look, huh?

11:41.753 --> 11:43.354
Put your index finger and thumb together

11:43.388 --> 11:45.389
to make a circle.

11:45.424 --> 11:48.325
Try not to let me break it.

11:48.360 --> 11:50.494
Good. Relax.

11:50.529 --> 11:52.196
Can you feel this?

11:52.230 --> 11:55.533
This, this, this, this?

11:55.567 --> 11:56.734
Your tendons and nerves are intact.

11:56.768 --> 11:58.069
A gram of ancef, draw up lidocaine,

11:58.103 --> 11:59.670
- and give me the suture kit.
- Yep.

11:59.705 --> 12:01.405
That's it? You're just gonna sew me up?

12:01.440 --> 12:03.674
Well, I don't see anything
else that needs treating.

12:03.709 --> 12:04.842
You're just like all the other docs.

12:04.876 --> 12:06.043
You don't care. You don't listen.

12:06.078 --> 12:07.545
You just want to get me out of here.

12:07.579 --> 12:08.579
I am listening to you, Mr. Janichek.

12:08.613 --> 12:10.948
- I feel crummy.
- Crummy?

12:10.982 --> 12:13.751
Yeah, pretty much all the time.

12:13.785 --> 12:15.953
Doris, let's get a CBC and CMP.

12:15.987 --> 12:16.554
Yes, Dr. Choi.

12:16.588 --> 12:19.156
Now can I sew you up?

12:21.960 --> 12:24.261
Hi. A nurse is gonna come by

12:24.296 --> 12:26.063
to start your discharge paperwork.

12:26.098 --> 12:29.366
Nance, look up the bus
schedule, will you, hon?

12:29.401 --> 12:31.268
- Yeah. Ah!
- Honey?

12:31.303 --> 12:33.938
Nancy, are you okay?

12:33.972 --> 12:37.074
Let me check your abdomen,
if you don't mind.

12:37.109 --> 12:39.643
How long have you had this pain?

12:39.678 --> 12:41.645
Uh, I don't know. A few days?

12:41.680 --> 12:42.780
Is there anything in particular

12:42.814 --> 12:44.615
that makes it hurt worse?

12:44.649 --> 12:47.118
Eating, twisting, lying down?

12:47.152 --> 12:49.120
Hurts just the same.

12:49.154 --> 12:50.788
Oof.

12:50.822 --> 12:52.790
Yeah, seems like appendicitis to me.

12:52.824 --> 12:55.092
I had my appendix out when I was 14.

12:55.127 --> 12:58.395
Any other surgeries?
C-section, any kids?

12:58.430 --> 13:02.633
No, I always wanted them,
but it never panned out.

13:02.667 --> 13:04.902
Well, it might be a hernia,

13:04.936 --> 13:06.470
but I'd like to get you into a bed

13:06.505 --> 13:07.972
and examine you more thoroughly.

13:08.006 --> 13:09.940
Run some tests.

13:09.975 --> 13:11.575
It's probably just a bellyache.

13:11.610 --> 13:13.911
Listen to the doctor, hon.

13:13.945 --> 13:16.313
- You'll be all right?
- Of course.

13:16.348 --> 13:19.350
Well, go on.

13:19.384 --> 13:21.786
Come on.

13:21.820 --> 13:24.221
Thank you. Right this way.

13:26.358 --> 13:28.159
Reese.

13:28.193 --> 13:30.027
When was the last time Robin
had a full work-up?

13:30.061 --> 13:31.662
Just before she was released from rehab.

13:31.696 --> 13:33.264
That was almost two months ago,

13:33.298 --> 13:37.968
how about a little
follow-up with your patient?

13:38.003 --> 13:40.437
She is not asymptomatic,

13:40.472 --> 13:42.006
but that's to be expected.

13:42.040 --> 13:43.941
Recovery does not happen
overnight, it's a process...

13:43.975 --> 13:45.476
So you reviewed her medication?

13:45.510 --> 13:46.977
- Yes.
- With her neurologist?

13:47.012 --> 13:48.846
And her internist, and her pharmacist.

13:48.880 --> 13:50.981
I've been monitoring Robin
very carefully.

13:51.016 --> 13:53.951
Maybe somebody else should.
Someone with more experience.

13:53.985 --> 13:55.820
Maybe a little more familiarity
with her condition.

13:55.854 --> 13:58.289
All right, if Robin
wants to change physicians,

13:58.323 --> 13:59.824
that is her right.

13:59.858 --> 14:01.792
But that should be
her request, not yours.

14:01.827 --> 14:03.494
I'm bringing her in tomorrow.

14:03.528 --> 14:05.396
She's gonna get a full neuro work up,

14:05.430 --> 14:08.532
plus labs, plus scans. Understand?

14:15.006 --> 14:17.041
Jessie, I have news for you.

14:17.075 --> 14:19.877
Some of which will make you very happy.

14:19.911 --> 14:22.413
So we ran a test
to check on your hCG level...

14:22.447 --> 14:24.148
that's pregnancy hormone...

14:24.182 --> 14:26.917
and it indicates that indeed,
you are pregnant.

14:28.720 --> 14:31.689
That's great! Honey, we did it.

14:33.525 --> 14:35.192
But?

14:35.227 --> 14:38.229
The other tests show that
you're hemoconcentrated.

14:38.263 --> 14:40.064
And that's a thickening of the blood.

14:40.098 --> 14:42.600
It's a symptom of
a condition called OHSS,

14:42.634 --> 14:45.035
Ovarian Hyper Stimulation Syndrome.

14:45.070 --> 14:48.239
Now this can occur when the hCG
from the IVF treatments

14:48.273 --> 14:51.675
and your pregnancy interacts
adversely with your estrogen.

14:51.710 --> 14:54.578
So because she got pregnant,
she got sick?

14:54.613 --> 14:57.081
- Yes.
- Is it serious?

14:57.115 --> 14:59.550
The concern is that
you're more likely to clot.

14:59.584 --> 15:01.619
And possibly throw a clot.

15:01.653 --> 15:03.621
So we'll monitor you carefully,

15:03.655 --> 15:06.056
but I think we can resolve the OHSS.

15:06.091 --> 15:08.792
We'll continue to hydrate you,
and start you on blood thinner.

15:08.827 --> 15:11.195
So everything's gonna be fine.

15:11.229 --> 15:13.264
Well, you're still
a little short of breath,

15:13.298 --> 15:14.932
so I'd like to send you for a CT scan

15:14.966 --> 15:17.768
just to play it safe.

15:17.802 --> 15:19.470
Okay.

15:19.504 --> 15:21.338
All right.

15:24.442 --> 15:26.110
Hey, Barry, you're going to
treatment three.

15:26.144 --> 15:29.246
- Doctor Choi?
- You guys... you guys are...

15:29.281 --> 15:30.714
Hey, I'm okay.

15:30.749 --> 15:32.883
33-year-old male, found in the park.

15:32.918 --> 15:35.552
Alcohol on the breath, the GCS is 13.

15:35.587 --> 15:37.488
He's a little groggy but improving.

15:37.522 --> 15:38.923
Minor head laceration.

15:38.957 --> 15:40.424
- I got it, Barry. Thanks.
- You got it.

15:40.458 --> 15:42.059
Mags, how about a nurse?

15:42.093 --> 15:45.062
I have no nurses, I'll be in in a sec.

15:45.096 --> 15:47.598
This patient. Indigent, no insurance?

15:47.632 --> 15:49.300
Afraid so.

15:49.334 --> 15:50.467
The hospital's gonna
have to eat up the cost.

15:50.502 --> 15:52.002
What are you gonna do?

15:52.037 --> 15:53.671
We'll give him the best care
humanly possible,

15:53.705 --> 15:56.640
no expense spared, but you
know, it would sure be nice

15:56.675 --> 15:59.810
to balance patients like him
with a few that have insurance.

15:59.844 --> 16:00.978
So maybe we can hire a few nurses.

16:01.012 --> 16:02.279
Maggie...

16:02.314 --> 16:03.914
Next time you're in the Gold Coast,

16:03.949 --> 16:06.150
picking up an MI with a fat wallet,

16:06.184 --> 16:08.485
how about bringing them here?

16:08.520 --> 16:10.888
Just as close as anyplace else.

16:15.026 --> 16:17.027
Nancy Buckley's results?

16:17.062 --> 16:19.430
Yeah, it's not a hernia.

16:19.464 --> 16:22.800
It's what I thought,
her CT shows appendicitis.

16:22.834 --> 16:24.535
But her charts said
her appendix was removed

16:24.569 --> 16:26.103
when she was a teenager.

16:26.137 --> 16:27.838
That's not the only thing that's off.

16:27.872 --> 16:30.874
Tubal ligation clips.
She had her tubes tied.

16:30.909 --> 16:32.876
Why wouldn't she put that
in her history?

16:32.911 --> 16:34.712
Maybe she didn't want her mom to know.

16:34.746 --> 16:36.347
Might be a touchy subject for them.

16:36.381 --> 16:37.948
You know what, Nancy said
she always wanted kids.

16:37.983 --> 16:39.717
This doesn't feel right.

16:39.751 --> 16:41.518
Well either way,
she's going to need surgery.

16:41.553 --> 16:44.722
Yeah, on an organ
she thinks she doesn't have.

16:52.330 --> 16:56.567
Ms. Buckley, your scan clearly
shows an inflamed appendix.

16:56.601 --> 16:57.701
We need to get you up to surgery

16:57.736 --> 16:58.902
right away before it ruptures.

16:58.937 --> 17:00.504
Well, how can it be inflamed?

17:00.538 --> 17:03.040
I had it out when I was a kid,
you saw the scar.

17:03.074 --> 17:05.976
Yeah, I understand that
this is very confusing,

17:06.011 --> 17:08.979
but that scar is actually
from a different procedure.

17:09.013 --> 17:11.181
No, I ain't had no other surgeries.

17:11.215 --> 17:12.915
- Ask my mama, she'll tell you.
- Dr. Manning.

17:12.961 --> 17:17.564
BP is 75/20 and dropping.

17:17.589 --> 17:20.557
Ms. Buckley? Nancy?

17:20.592 --> 17:24.060
BP's still dropping.
Heart rate spiking to 145.

17:24.095 --> 17:26.396
Her appendix is ruptured,
we need to get her to surgery.

17:26.431 --> 17:28.766
Get her IV wide open,
and call up to the OR

17:28.800 --> 17:30.467
and tell them we're on our way.
Let's go!

17:33.923 --> 17:36.090
What's wrong with my Nancy?

17:36.115 --> 17:37.449
I'm afraid we had to send
your daughter up

17:37.483 --> 17:39.184
for an emergency appendectomy.

17:39.218 --> 17:42.354
- Appendectomy?
- Yes, her appendix burst.

17:42.388 --> 17:43.990
Oh.

17:44.323 --> 17:45.957
Ms. Buckley.

17:45.992 --> 17:47.859
Your daughter believes that
she had her appendix out

17:47.894 --> 17:49.861
when she was 14 years old.

17:49.896 --> 17:51.229
Why would she think that?

17:51.264 --> 17:55.634
W... That's what the doc said back then.

17:55.668 --> 17:56.902
Well, she does have a scar,

17:56.936 --> 17:59.548
but it's not from an appendectomy.

17:59.839 --> 18:01.423
Well, uh...

18:01.689 --> 18:03.942
I don't know what to say.

18:03.976 --> 18:08.476
Her appendix is not the only
thing we saw on her scan.

18:09.348 --> 18:10.916
She was a minor.

18:11.288 --> 18:13.385
You would have had to give consent.

18:17.866 --> 18:20.735
Back home, in Blue Ridge country,

18:21.329 --> 18:24.261
I was young and poor when I had her.

18:24.639 --> 18:29.067
Nancy was a wild teenager,
always getting into trouble.

18:29.101 --> 18:32.003
Finally, this judge who
practically ran the county,

18:32.038 --> 18:35.507
he told me if I wanted
to keep Nancy out of jail,

18:35.541 --> 18:37.742
I had to make a choice.

18:37.777 --> 18:39.845
So you agreed to have her tubes tied?

18:39.879 --> 18:41.446
The way she was going,

18:41.481 --> 18:45.116
she'd have been pregnant
by the time she was 15,

18:45.151 --> 18:49.454
dropped out of school, come to nothing.

18:49.489 --> 18:51.356
That was my life.

18:51.390 --> 18:55.660
I wasn't about to see
my daughter turn out the same.

18:55.695 --> 18:57.529
Ms. Buckley,

18:57.563 --> 19:01.466
don't you think your daughter
deserves to know the truth?

19:01.501 --> 19:04.469
Well, I-I thought about it.

19:06.072 --> 19:11.543
W-What good would it do?
What's done is done.

19:11.577 --> 19:15.113
She always wanted to have kids.

19:15.147 --> 19:16.882
Knowing what her mama did to her

19:16.916 --> 19:20.886
only bring her more misery.

19:20.920 --> 19:24.356
Please don't tell her.

19:29.662 --> 19:32.631
Hi, Arlo, I'm Dr. Reese.
I'm here to help you.

19:32.665 --> 19:36.835
Please, don't touch me.
You'll be contaminated.

19:36.869 --> 19:38.670
Uh, contaminated with what?

19:38.704 --> 19:40.071
Radium.

19:40.106 --> 19:42.641
How were you exposed to radium?

19:42.675 --> 19:46.378
My professor, he works for the CIA.

19:46.412 --> 19:48.813
He put it in my food.

19:48.848 --> 19:50.749
I see. I see.

19:50.783 --> 19:53.351
Do you mind if I take a seat?

19:55.788 --> 19:58.356
J-Just don't touch me.

19:58.391 --> 20:00.058
All right.

20:03.930 --> 20:05.864
Be careful.

20:08.234 --> 20:11.937
Arlo, I, uh... I appreciate
your concern for me,

20:11.971 --> 20:15.073
but I understand
the risk that I'm taking.

20:15.107 --> 20:18.410
Uh, I just want to help you,
if you will let me.

20:20.813 --> 20:23.214
My arms hurt.

20:24.984 --> 20:30.555
I'm sorry.

20:31.490 --> 20:34.259
Uh, we can remove the restraints

20:34.293 --> 20:38.964
if you can stay calm. Can you do that?

20:38.998 --> 20:43.068
Just don't touch me.

20:43.102 --> 20:46.538
We will only touch the restraints.

20:58.017 --> 21:00.352
I said be careful!

21:01.454 --> 21:03.188
Okay.

21:37.857 --> 21:39.524
Thank you.

21:43.362 --> 21:45.864
Then make room in the schedule, okay?

21:45.898 --> 21:48.967
She's getting that scan tomorrow.

21:49.001 --> 21:50.268
Connor.

21:52.805 --> 21:54.606
You okay?

21:56.709 --> 22:00.178
Yeah, uh...

22:00.212 --> 22:03.048
Robin's not having a good day.

22:03.082 --> 22:06.718
Sorry to hear that.

22:06.752 --> 22:10.121
Look, I need a consult,
but I'll ask someone else.

22:10.156 --> 22:12.457
No, I'm good.

22:17.363 --> 22:19.364
Jessie, this is Dr. Rhodes.

22:19.398 --> 22:20.799
- He's a cardiothoracic surgeon.
- Hi.

22:20.833 --> 22:22.701
What did you find?

22:22.735 --> 22:25.670
So the scans showed us this.

22:25.705 --> 22:27.072
What you're looking at is

22:27.106 --> 22:29.708
a partially obstructing
saddle pulmonary embolism.

22:29.742 --> 22:31.242
It's a blood clot.

22:31.277 --> 22:33.645
Now, because of the
location of the clot,

22:33.679 --> 22:35.680
surgical intervention
may become necessary.

22:35.715 --> 22:37.148
But not yet.

22:37.183 --> 22:40.151
The clot is small, so I'm hoping that if

22:40.186 --> 22:42.520
we up the dose of the anticoagulants,

22:42.555 --> 22:44.756
- switch to a heparin drip...
- Mm-hmm.

22:44.790 --> 22:46.357
That may take care of it.

22:46.392 --> 22:47.258
Okay.

22:47.293 --> 22:48.860
We'll bring you back down to the ED

22:48.894 --> 22:50.061
and keep a close eye on you.

22:50.096 --> 22:52.330
- Thanks.
- You got it.

22:53.232 --> 22:55.934
Mr. Janichek, I have your test results,

22:55.968 --> 22:58.036
and everything is normal.

22:58.070 --> 23:00.672
You're mildly anemic,
hemoglobin's at 9.5,

23:00.706 --> 23:03.608
but that'll resolve
if you just eat more red meat.

23:03.642 --> 23:04.943
Nothing else?

23:04.977 --> 23:06.711
You look like a healthy man to me.

23:06.746 --> 23:10.715
Well, what about my symptoms?
The clumsiness, feeling lousy?

23:10.750 --> 23:13.384
I don't see a medical reason
for any of that.

23:13.419 --> 23:14.919
Have you been getting enough sleep?

23:14.954 --> 23:16.454
Oh, forget it.

23:16.489 --> 23:17.722
I've been through this
dog and pony show before.

23:17.757 --> 23:18.957
I understand it's frustrating

23:18.991 --> 23:20.692
not to get a definitive diagnosis.

23:20.726 --> 23:22.694
Just let me get out of here,
that's all you want anyway.

23:22.728 --> 23:24.562
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

23:24.597 --> 23:27.966
I don't want to
send you home feeling that way.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.468
I can call for
a neuro consult if you want.

23:30.503 --> 23:33.071
Yes, anything.

23:33.105 --> 23:35.707
Okay.

23:35.741 --> 23:38.643
Come in.

23:38.677 --> 23:40.111
Sharon?

23:40.146 --> 23:42.614
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:42.648 --> 23:44.115
I've been thinking about

23:44.150 --> 23:46.985
how we can hire more nurses for the ED.

23:47.019 --> 23:48.987
Maggie, I've already told you...

23:49.021 --> 23:50.455
I know, I know. No money.

23:50.489 --> 23:53.491
But if the ED had more patients,

23:53.526 --> 23:57.095
hopefully with insurance, that
would mean more money, right?

23:57.129 --> 23:59.230
- Yeah.
- So who brings us patients?

23:59.265 --> 24:02.167
The paramedics. And if they
liked coming to Med,

24:02.201 --> 24:06.271
if they were motivated to come
to Med, that's what they'd do.

24:06.305 --> 24:08.306
They'd bring us more patients.

24:08.340 --> 24:09.908
And how do you propose

24:09.942 --> 24:12.844
to motivate the paramedics, Maggie?

24:12.878 --> 24:16.581
That's really pretty simple.

24:23.722 --> 24:26.191
Hey. What's going on?

24:26.225 --> 24:29.527
Sorry, um...

24:29.562 --> 24:33.498
Did you know that up until
1973 in North Carolina,

24:33.532 --> 24:35.033
women could get sterilized

24:35.067 --> 24:36.434
without their knowledge or consent?

24:36.468 --> 24:38.203
My patient had her daughter's tubes tied

24:38.237 --> 24:40.505
when she was 14. 14.

24:40.539 --> 24:43.474
All because a judge thought
it would be good for her.

24:43.509 --> 24:44.809
Man.

24:44.844 --> 24:46.377
The daughter always wanted to have kids,

24:46.412 --> 24:47.946
and never knew why she couldn't.

24:47.980 --> 24:51.182
- She never went to a doctor?
- No, too poor.

24:51.217 --> 24:53.284
Can you believe they could do that?

24:53.319 --> 24:56.020
Deprive a woman of her ability
to have children,

24:56.055 --> 24:58.022
something so fundamental.

24:58.057 --> 25:00.158
This woman who was sterilized...

25:00.192 --> 25:02.227
How do you break news like that?

25:02.261 --> 25:04.796
I'm asking myself the same thing.

25:10.002 --> 25:12.403
Mr. Janichek's not exhibiting
any neurologic deficits.

25:12.438 --> 25:13.905
And what about his clumsiness?

25:13.939 --> 25:15.640
Awfully vague complaint,
hardly warranted a consult.

25:15.674 --> 25:17.242
It's just the patient's desperate.

25:17.276 --> 25:18.476
He insists there's something
wrong with him.

25:18.510 --> 25:19.844
Since when do we listen to patients?

25:19.879 --> 25:21.379
Maybe some sort of
heavy metal poisoning,

25:21.413 --> 25:23.414
- lead or mercury...
- Dr. Choi,

25:23.449 --> 25:25.250
if you want to was the time
and money ordering those tests,

25:25.284 --> 25:27.285
you be my guest, but I'm done here.

25:34.360 --> 25:35.994
I just got a call from Robin.

25:36.028 --> 25:37.095
She was arrested for shoplifting?

25:37.129 --> 25:38.663
No, she wasn't arrested.

25:38.697 --> 25:39.931
She got caught trying
to leave the store,

25:39.965 --> 25:41.599
but I took care of it.

25:41.634 --> 25:43.534
Well, apparently it's been
going on for a while, though.

25:43.569 --> 25:45.937
I realize that now, but I had no idea.

25:45.971 --> 25:48.539
Have there been any signs?
Like, at home, or...

25:48.574 --> 25:52.510
Dr. Charles, a woman has new
clothes and that's suspicious?

25:52.544 --> 25:55.113
She's not a prisoner,
I can't keep her locked up.

25:55.147 --> 25:56.781
She's got a life of her own.

25:56.815 --> 25:58.516
I have a patient to see.

25:58.550 --> 26:03.254
Connor, I-I appreciate that
you're doing the best you can,

26:03.289 --> 26:06.090
but given the all-consuming nature of...

26:06.125 --> 26:08.126
Dr. Charles, Robin and I are fine.

26:08.160 --> 26:10.862
I'm gonna see her through this.

26:12.665 --> 26:14.232
Will?

26:14.266 --> 26:16.034
Heart rate's 140, BP's down to 90/70.

26:16.068 --> 26:17.101
- Keith.
- I'm right here, honey.

26:17.136 --> 26:18.803
02 sat's down to 85.

26:18.837 --> 26:20.872
Heparin's not working.
She's continuing to embolize.

26:20.906 --> 26:22.640
- She's in respiratory failure.
- Why? What's happening?

26:22.675 --> 26:24.475
The clot in her lung has progressed.

26:24.510 --> 26:26.277
It's cutting off blood flow
and straining her heart.

26:26.312 --> 26:28.880
BP's down to 60/30. Sat's at 75.

26:28.914 --> 26:31.549
Okay, we need to intubate.
20 of etomidate, 100 of sux.

26:31.583 --> 26:32.884
Maybe you want to wait outside?

26:32.918 --> 26:34.285
No, I'm not leaving her.

26:34.320 --> 26:35.720
All right, tell the OR
we're on the way up

26:35.754 --> 26:37.322
- and to prep the hybrid room.
- Yes, Doctor.

26:37.356 --> 26:38.957
Your wife needs surgery now.

26:38.991 --> 26:40.491
We need to remove the clot
from her pulmonary artery,

26:40.526 --> 26:42.060
otherwise it could kill her.

26:42.094 --> 26:43.494
Just save her, please!

26:43.529 --> 26:45.129
- I'm in.
- All right, let's go.

26:52.748 --> 26:56.025
We're in a good position.
Let's start the extraction.

26:56.111 --> 26:58.962
Pressure's a little soft, 80/50.

26:59.002 --> 27:00.770
I've been working on that.

27:00.804 --> 27:03.272
Gas looks fine, but I've given
a half liter of crystalloid

27:03.307 --> 27:05.392
to minimum effect. Starting Neo now.

27:05.439 --> 27:07.907
- You let in the anesthetic?
- Already done.

27:07.947 --> 27:09.576
She's still dropping.

27:09.610 --> 27:11.611
The catheter must be
obstructing the outflow tract.

27:11.646 --> 27:13.813
Her heart's failing,
we need to open her chest.

27:13.848 --> 27:16.054
Bring in the bypass machine.
Marty, start a second pressor

27:16.101 --> 27:17.202
to buy me some time.

27:17.227 --> 27:18.994
I put in the catheter,
did I make a mistake?

27:19.028 --> 27:21.429
Nope, it's not your fault,
it happens sometimes.

27:21.464 --> 27:23.665
Scalpel and sternal saw. Let's move.

27:23.699 --> 27:24.966
Sternal saw.

27:31.407 --> 27:34.835
I'm just out of control.

27:35.442 --> 27:36.972
It's okay.

27:37.813 --> 27:41.483
It's okay, it's okay.

27:41.517 --> 27:43.184
I don't know what to do.

27:43.211 --> 27:46.794
And I feel like
I will never get past this.

27:46.834 --> 27:48.997
What, your illness? Of course you will.

27:49.060 --> 27:50.701
You just... you've had a setback.
That's all it is.

27:50.744 --> 27:53.346
No, Dad. It's more than that.

27:53.371 --> 27:57.007
It's about what I have become to Connor.

27:57.370 --> 28:01.412
And to everyone, it's like
I'm someone to be pitied.

28:01.745 --> 28:05.182
Or taken care of. And I am drowning.

28:05.217 --> 28:07.251
No, no, honey. Come here, sweetie.

28:07.285 --> 28:09.520
It's okay, I'm here.

28:09.554 --> 28:12.615
- I'm gonna help you, okay?
- No, Dad.

28:12.733 --> 28:16.069
Don't you see that
I don't want to be helped?

28:16.104 --> 28:20.807
I am tired of being a disease.

28:21.447 --> 28:25.322
- I want to be a person again.
- Okay.

28:25.546 --> 28:27.752
Okay, so, um,

28:28.182 --> 28:29.950
so how you want to do that?

28:36.958 --> 28:38.625
Mr. Rowe.

28:40.956 --> 28:43.720
So we tried to remove the clot
from your wife's lung

28:43.745 --> 28:45.409
with a minimally invasive procedure.

28:45.440 --> 28:47.662
Unfortunately, her heart
couldn't tolerate it,

28:47.696 --> 28:50.164
So we did have to open her chest.

28:51.667 --> 28:53.877
Now, the important thing is,

28:54.291 --> 28:56.588
we were able to remove
the clot successfully.

28:57.018 --> 28:59.833
Her pulmonary artery pressures
have already come down,

28:59.920 --> 29:01.955
and I have every reason to believe

29:01.989 --> 29:04.624
that she's gonna make
a quick and full recovery.

29:09.063 --> 29:11.164
And the baby?

29:11.198 --> 29:15.301
No indication that
the pregnancy was affected.

29:26.113 --> 29:29.549
Thank you, Dr. Rhodes.

29:29.583 --> 29:31.885
I don't know what else to say.

29:31.919 --> 29:34.487
Keith.

29:34.522 --> 29:37.390
I'm right here, honey.

29:37.425 --> 29:40.627
You're gonna be fine.

29:49.069 --> 29:50.370
It's all good.

29:50.404 --> 29:54.340
Great. Thanks, Connor.

29:54.375 --> 29:56.342
Nice people.

29:56.377 --> 30:01.181
Yeah, they've really
been put through it today.

30:01.215 --> 30:02.749
Kinda makes you realize

30:02.783 --> 30:05.885
how small your own problems are, huh?

30:05.920 --> 30:09.255
And that sometimes, things work out.

30:14.762 --> 30:17.797
Who's got three?
Where's Monique? Monique?

30:17.831 --> 30:19.865
I need you to turn over three
and get it cleaned up.

30:19.900 --> 30:21.034
Here are the files, here.

30:21.068 --> 30:22.769
- Yes, ma'am.
- Oh!

30:22.802 --> 30:26.371
Ladies and gentleman,
by unanimous decision,

30:26.407 --> 30:27.807
and still retaining his title

30:27.842 --> 30:30.310
as welterweight champion of the world,

30:30.344 --> 30:32.378
Noah "The Doctor" Sexton!

30:36.450 --> 30:38.084
Welcome back.

30:45.192 --> 30:46.559
Are you sure you should be at work?

30:46.594 --> 30:48.328
You don't look very good.

30:48.362 --> 30:50.864
Thanks. You look good.

30:54.301 --> 30:56.069
She's doing well.

30:56.103 --> 30:58.738
They're weaning her sedation
and should extubate soon.

30:58.772 --> 31:01.074
Good. Now here comes the hard part.

31:01.108 --> 31:02.809
You mean you're gonna tell her?

31:02.843 --> 31:04.844
It's her body, April.

31:04.879 --> 31:07.647
It's her life.
She has every right to know.

31:07.681 --> 31:09.649
These two women only have each other.

31:09.683 --> 31:13.152
We drop this on Nancy, she may
never forgive her mother.

31:13.187 --> 31:15.922
I understand, but we are
legally bound to tell her.

31:15.956 --> 31:17.924
We're gonna destroy this family

31:17.958 --> 31:20.593
over something they
can't do anything about?

31:20.628 --> 31:22.795
That is for Nancy to decide.

31:22.830 --> 31:25.665
She has been denied a choice
her entire life.

31:25.699 --> 31:27.100
We cannot change her past,

31:27.134 --> 31:30.136
but at least we can give her
a say in her future.

31:35.643 --> 31:38.878
75 inches? 60 wasn't big enough?

31:38.913 --> 31:41.114
You know how it is.
It's never big enough.

31:41.148 --> 31:43.049
Accounting is gonna raise hell.

31:43.083 --> 31:44.951
Well, we've got to spend
money to make money, right?

31:44.985 --> 31:46.686
Eh, well, let's hope so.

31:46.720 --> 31:48.521
- Mm-hm.
- This for the doctor's lounge?

31:48.556 --> 31:49.956
- This way.
- Nope.

31:49.990 --> 31:51.791
I'm sorry, it's for the pizza room.

31:51.825 --> 31:56.029
- What's a pizza room?
- Motivational tool.

31:59.700 --> 32:01.968
- Has he been agitated?
- No.

32:02.002 --> 32:03.970
Any need to put him back in restraints?

32:04.004 --> 32:05.405
No.

32:05.439 --> 32:07.340
Good, let's transfer him up
to the Psych Ward.

32:07.374 --> 32:09.909
Do you want to examine him before we do?

32:09.944 --> 32:12.712
Uh, no, no. I'll check on him upstairs.

32:12.746 --> 32:14.347
- Okay.
- Okay.

32:16.116 --> 32:19.052
Hey.

32:19.086 --> 32:20.820
Sarah.

32:20.854 --> 32:22.555
I got this patient in six...

32:22.590 --> 32:25.058
ataxia, clumsiness, general malaise.

32:25.092 --> 32:28.061
I can't find anything,
and Abrams cleared him.

32:28.095 --> 32:30.663
Do you want a psych consult?

32:30.698 --> 32:32.065
The guy's convinced he's sick,

32:32.099 --> 32:34.000
and wasn't happy when
his labs came back normal.

32:34.034 --> 32:36.002
Adamant we keep testing.

32:36.036 --> 32:39.038
Maybe factitious disorder;
likes being in the hospital,

32:39.073 --> 32:41.908
doted on, needs people
to believe he's sick.

32:41.942 --> 32:43.676
Want to take a run at him?

32:43.711 --> 32:45.778
Otherwise, I got no reason to keep him.

32:45.813 --> 32:47.614
Sure.

32:47.648 --> 32:49.882
Thanks.

32:51.719 --> 32:53.886
Mr. Janichek? I'm Dr. Reese.

32:53.921 --> 32:56.022
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

32:56.056 --> 32:59.359
- What kind of doctor are you?
- I am a psychiatrist.

32:59.393 --> 33:02.095
A shrink? You think I'm crazy?

33:02.129 --> 33:04.764
No, we just can't find
a, uh, physical reason

33:04.798 --> 33:06.532
for the symptoms you're describing.

33:06.567 --> 33:08.401
Which means you think
I'm crazy or I'm making it up.

33:08.435 --> 33:10.370
No, we just want to explore
all the possibilities.

33:10.404 --> 33:13.406
I don't believe you people.
I'm a sick man.

33:13.440 --> 33:16.542
I come here looking for help,
and no one believes me.

33:16.577 --> 33:17.877
How many doctors do I have to go to?

33:17.911 --> 33:19.545
Mr. Janichek, please back away.

33:19.580 --> 33:21.214
What do I have to do, huh?
Why won't you help me?

33:21.248 --> 33:23.716
- Mr. Janichek!
- Ahh! Ah!

33:29.757 --> 33:32.125
- Sarah, what happened?
- My eyes!

33:32.159 --> 33:34.560
- She sprayed me! Ah.
- Oh, my God.

33:34.595 --> 33:36.562
Get me some water.

33:36.597 --> 33:38.064
Ah, my eyes!

33:38.098 --> 33:39.766
Sarah, you should go.

33:42.102 --> 33:44.070
Go!

33:44.104 --> 33:47.440
Mr. Janichek, just try to
breathe normally, okay?

33:53.729 --> 33:55.862
Dr. Charles isn't answering.

33:56.611 --> 33:58.853
Why can't you just admit
Where are we on this, Dr. Choi?

33:58.923 --> 34:00.337
We flushed Mr. Janichek's eyes.

34:00.380 --> 34:02.081
There's no sign of external injury.

34:02.111 --> 34:04.012
His vitals are stable. He's lucid.

34:04.047 --> 34:05.857
And extremely pissed off.

34:05.983 --> 34:08.989
A doctor attacking a patient, really?

34:10.020 --> 34:11.717
Go on, Dr. Choi.

34:11.755 --> 34:13.054
Mr. Janichek
hit the gurney when he fell,

34:13.090 --> 34:14.623
so we're ordering an abdominal CT

34:14.658 --> 34:16.492
to make sure there's no
internal injuries.

34:16.525 --> 34:19.629
Did he hit his head?
Are you ordering a head scan?

34:19.663 --> 34:22.031
There's no head injury.
No indication of concussion.

34:22.065 --> 34:24.409
Dr. Choi, this is CYA time.

34:24.434 --> 34:26.569
It's bad enough he sues us
for the pepper spray,

34:26.603 --> 34:28.270
If we miss something...

34:28.304 --> 34:30.106
Order a pan scan.

34:30.139 --> 34:32.475
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you, Dr. Choi.

34:32.509 --> 34:35.077
Dr. Stohl, Peter.

34:40.817 --> 34:44.520
Can you give me any
explanation for your behavior?

34:50.827 --> 34:53.629
I'm sorry.

34:56.900 --> 35:01.771
Dr. Reese, you're suspended
until further notice.

35:01.805 --> 35:03.606
I need your pass.

35:13.583 --> 35:14.817
Go home.

35:20.423 --> 35:24.827
So this is what?
A ploy to woo the paramedics?

35:24.861 --> 35:27.029
Pretty much, yeah.

35:28.698 --> 35:31.066
It'll work.

35:31.101 --> 35:33.836
Mmm, pepperoni and sausage.

35:33.870 --> 35:35.604
- Mm-hmm.
- Nice.

35:38.575 --> 35:39.642
Mmm!

35:41.044 --> 35:43.746
Sterilized?

35:43.780 --> 35:46.315
When? But how?

35:46.349 --> 35:47.850
When you were 14.

35:47.884 --> 35:51.253
When they said they were
taking out your appendix,

35:51.288 --> 35:52.822
they were actually doing a procedure

35:52.856 --> 35:55.191
called tubal ligation.

35:55.225 --> 35:57.526
Your tubes were tied.

36:00.397 --> 36:05.234
They did this without asking me?

36:05.268 --> 36:07.870
Did Mama know?

36:07.904 --> 36:11.240
You'll have to ask her that.

36:11.274 --> 36:13.876
Oh, my God.

36:20.817 --> 36:23.018
I'll give you two some time.

36:39.469 --> 36:42.438
How could she ever forgive her mom?

36:44.908 --> 36:50.412
I lost my baby,
but I can still have another.

36:50.447 --> 36:53.249
If that were taken away from me,

36:53.283 --> 36:56.085
I don't know that I could forgive.

36:56.119 --> 36:58.587
I don't know.

36:58.622 --> 37:01.323
People can sometimes surprise you.

37:16.006 --> 37:18.274
Robin?

37:23.813 --> 37:25.948
Robin?

37:52.175 --> 37:53.909
Thanks, Dad.

37:55.679 --> 37:58.047
It's gonna be very hard on Connor.

37:58.081 --> 37:59.782
He cares about you a lot.

37:59.816 --> 38:01.450
I know.

38:01.484 --> 38:05.287
But I have to do this.
I have to get away.

38:07.824 --> 38:10.326
Gonna miss you.

38:10.360 --> 38:13.529
I'm gonna miss you too, Dad.

38:14.998 --> 38:18.834
Make sure you remember to say
hi to your mom for me, okay?

38:18.868 --> 38:20.970
Good-bye, honey.

38:24.374 --> 38:26.041
Bye, Dad.

38:34.718 --> 38:37.519
Come in.

38:40.056 --> 38:42.358
Mr. Janichek's scans were
negative for concussion

38:42.392 --> 38:43.592
or any other acute injury.

38:43.626 --> 38:45.427
All right, dodged that bullet.

38:45.462 --> 38:46.695
But we did notice something else

38:46.730 --> 38:49.198
unrelated to his being sprayed.

38:49.232 --> 38:50.666
An enlarged spleen?

38:50.700 --> 38:53.769
- Yes.
- This our fault?

38:53.803 --> 38:55.404
No.

38:55.438 --> 38:58.173
I ordered an enzyme activity
level test to follow up.

38:58.208 --> 38:59.708
It showed Mr. Janichek is suffering

38:59.743 --> 39:02.511
from a genetic disorder
called Gaucher's disease.

39:02.545 --> 39:04.346
An enzyme deficiency which presents

39:04.381 --> 39:06.048
with a vague constellation of symptoms;

39:06.082 --> 39:08.717
malaise, anemia, low platelets.

39:08.752 --> 39:10.452
Please tell me there's a treatment.

39:10.487 --> 39:11.887
Because we cannot assault a man

39:11.921 --> 39:15.090
and then inform him he has
an incurable disease.

39:15.125 --> 39:17.026
His spleen is dangerously enlarged,

39:17.060 --> 39:18.594
so it has to be removed,

39:18.628 --> 39:20.696
but the deficiency itself
is easily treatable

39:20.730 --> 39:23.132
with regular
enzyme replacement infusions.

39:23.166 --> 39:25.401
All right, you'll inform the patient.

39:25.435 --> 39:28.570
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.

39:28.605 --> 39:30.139
I should say that Mr. Janichek

39:30.173 --> 39:32.074
will find this to be good news.

39:32.108 --> 39:33.742
A genetic disease?

39:33.777 --> 39:35.411
He's been suffering a long time,

39:35.445 --> 39:37.913
unable to find a diagnosis.

39:37.947 --> 39:42.618
In fact, I was ready to send him home.

39:43.953 --> 39:45.487
We never would have ordered
that pan scan

39:45.522 --> 39:49.425
if Dr. Reese hadn't done what she did.

39:49.459 --> 39:51.160
She might have saved his life.

40:04.307 --> 40:06.341
Hey.

40:06.376 --> 40:09.511
I got home, and I found this from Robin.

40:09.546 --> 40:11.113
Did you know that
she was planning on leaving?

40:11.147 --> 40:13.015
Connor, she just made
the decision today.

40:13.049 --> 40:15.084
She doesn't feel like
she can get well here.

40:15.118 --> 40:16.685
And nobody thought to
involve me in this discussion?

40:16.719 --> 40:18.454
Well, she didn't want to tell you

40:18.488 --> 40:19.621
because she knew
you'd try and change her mind.

40:19.656 --> 40:22.157
You're damn right I would!

40:22.192 --> 40:23.959
Where is she?

40:23.993 --> 40:25.761
It's really up to Robin
to reveal that, I think.

40:25.795 --> 40:27.596
No, you have no right
to keep this from me.

40:27.630 --> 40:29.331
She asked me not to tell you.

40:29.365 --> 40:31.200
Look, Connor,
she promised me she'd call you

40:31.234 --> 40:32.768
as soon as she is feeling better.

40:32.802 --> 40:34.269
Oh, man, I bet you love this, don't you?

40:34.304 --> 40:35.637
- What?
- You didn't want me

40:35.672 --> 40:37.206
to be with her in the first place.

40:37.240 --> 40:38.674
You didn't think I was good for her.

40:38.708 --> 40:40.976
In fact, I bet this was all your idea.

40:41.010 --> 40:44.613
Connor, whatever reservations
I had about your relationship

40:44.647 --> 40:46.849
are long past, okay?

40:46.883 --> 40:49.017
I promise you,
this was all Robin's decision.

40:49.052 --> 40:50.486
Fine. I don't care

40:50.520 --> 40:51.820
if you don't want
to tell me where she is,

40:51.855 --> 40:53.355
because I'm gonna find her,

40:53.389 --> 40:55.157
and I'm gonna bring her back.

41:11.241 --> 41:13.976
Hey, Dr. Charles.

41:20.517 --> 41:22.551
Thanks, Noah.

41:44.114 --> 41:46.979
What have I done?
