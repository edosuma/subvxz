WEBVTT

00:02.235 --> 00:04.999
<i>NARRA TOR: Previously on</i> Stargate SG-1.

00:05.138 --> 00:06.537
Where the hell are they?

00:06.639 --> 00:07.606
(GRUNTS)

00:08.708 --> 00:12.075
We've been investigating the Goa'uld
infiltration of the Trust for two years now.

00:12.178 --> 00:13.975
I'm telling you it's a global conspiracy.

00:14.114 --> 00:15.775
What are you guys saying?

00:15.915 --> 00:17.143
You think that I've been brainwashed.

00:17.250 --> 00:21.243
The technology is readily available
to the Goa'uld who infiltrated the Trust.

00:32.632 --> 00:34.395
You made good time, Colonel.

00:34.501 --> 00:38.164
Yes, sir. Well, it's a good thing I left early.
I took a wrong turn at the post office,

00:38.271 --> 00:41.172
I was driving for about an hour before
my Special Forces training kicked in

00:41.274 --> 00:43.265
and I realized I was lost.

00:43.376 --> 00:44.775
That, and the road ended.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.937
Wiser men than you have done worse.

00:47.047 --> 00:49.277
So, this is General O'Neill's place?

00:49.382 --> 00:51.179
Actually, Jack hasn't been able
to use it much,

00:51.284 --> 00:53.445
now that he spends a lot of time
in Washington.

00:53.820 --> 00:54.787
His loss.

00:54.888 --> 00:55.855
Come on in.

00:56.656 --> 00:58.521
Looks like I beat the others up here.

00:58.658 --> 01:02.025
Walter just called. Colonel Reynolds'
team has been delayed offworld.

01:02.128 --> 01:03.618
Teal'c's gone to assist.

01:03.730 --> 01:04.697
Is there a problem?

01:04.798 --> 01:06.493
Nothing they can't handle.

01:06.599 --> 01:09.796
Unfortunately, it also means
that Colonel Carter will be delayed

01:09.903 --> 01:12.633
until Reynolds gets back
to take command of the SGC.

01:12.739 --> 01:13.899
What about Jackson?

01:14.007 --> 01:15.201
Still in England.

01:15.308 --> 01:19.301
Seems he's met some lord or earl
with a private library

01:19.412 --> 01:21.505
of ancient reference material on Merlin

01:21.614 --> 01:24.811
and Morgan Le Fay.
He's obviously quite excited.

01:25.318 --> 01:27.946
Yeah. Like a fat kid in a candy store.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.182
I was a big boy in my youth.

01:31.991 --> 01:34.186
Never did appreciate comments like that.

01:34.461 --> 01:35.689
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

01:35.795 --> 01:38.025
Anyway, Vala's hitching a ride
with the others,

01:38.131 --> 01:39.621
so until then, it's just you and me.

01:39.966 --> 01:43.766
I'll be sure to stay out of your way, sir.
You won't even know I'm here.

01:43.870 --> 01:44.962
Nonsense!

01:45.772 --> 01:48.002
Getting to know each other
a little better outside of work

01:48.108 --> 01:51.202
and the pressure of the SGC
is what this is all about.

01:51.311 --> 01:53.939
Kick back. Put our feet up for the day.

01:54.147 --> 01:56.138
Well, that's kind of hard to do
with the fate of the galaxy

01:56.249 --> 01:57.910
hanging in the balance, sir.

01:58.017 --> 02:01.475
Well, if anyone is going to make
a difference in this battle, Colonel,

02:01.588 --> 02:03.453
it's you and your team.

02:04.090 --> 02:07.059
Yes, sir. I see what you mean
about escaping the pressure.

02:07.160 --> 02:08.855
We all need to stop for air now and then,

02:09.329 --> 02:10.455
or we'll burn out.

02:10.563 --> 02:12.690
That's the one thing you people
don't know how to do,

02:12.899 --> 02:14.628
so I'm making it an order.

02:14.901 --> 02:16.266
Yes, sir.

02:17.370 --> 02:18.997
I'm sure it'll be fun, sir.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.073
You're damn right it'll be fun.

02:24.344 --> 02:25.675
Come on in.

02:26.713 --> 02:28.408
LANDRY: I've got the coffee on.

02:38.124 --> 02:40.991
REYNOLDS: The first villager went missing
sometime yesterday morning.

02:41.094 --> 02:42.755
Another by nightfall.

02:42.862 --> 02:47.060
They sent out search parties, armed men.
These people are capable hunters.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.226
By all accounts, they've lived
on this planet for generations

02:49.335 --> 02:53.396
and never encountered an animal they
perceived as an unmanageable threat.

02:53.506 --> 02:55.633
Perhaps it was not an animal.

03:03.683 --> 03:06.743
So if an animal didn't tear these people
apart, what did?

04:18.992 --> 04:22.257
The people of P9J 333
have never before encountered

04:22.362 --> 04:25.160
an indigenous creature they believe
capable of such an act.

04:25.498 --> 04:28.524
So, you think this is some sort of
motivational tool meant to strike fear?

04:28.635 --> 04:29.863
An Ori bogeyman?

04:29.969 --> 04:32.403
It seems to be working.
The people are terrified.

04:32.505 --> 04:34.200
Any chance the Prior knew
you were there?

04:34.307 --> 04:36.366
I doubt this was a message directed at us.

04:36.476 --> 04:39.843
Our mission was to covertly observe
if the planet went Origin or not.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.379
We didn't make contact
with the population

04:41.481 --> 04:43.039
until after people started going missing.

04:43.149 --> 04:47.108
Okay. Well, if this is some new Ori threat,
chances are the Prior will show up

04:47.220 --> 04:48.346
to take responsibility.

04:48.454 --> 04:50.888
On the other hand, if it's not,

04:50.990 --> 04:54.016
and it's just some vicious creature
hell-bent on eating the whole village,

04:54.127 --> 04:57.392
shouldn't we use our superior technology
to help track it down?

05:00.033 --> 05:03.730
You think I don't really care about
the plight of some innocent people

05:03.836 --> 05:06.100
I've never met
on some planet somewhere.

05:06.272 --> 05:07.330
CARTER: I'm sorry, but...

05:07.740 --> 05:08.729
Well, yes.

05:08.841 --> 05:10.934
It just so happens
I do have vast experience

05:11.044 --> 05:13.376
hunting rare deadly creatures of all kinds.

05:13.813 --> 05:15.474
Let me guess, the rarer they are...

05:15.581 --> 05:17.742
Please. I am here to be helpful.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.915
If you don't think these boys
can use my expertise, that's fine.

05:21.020 --> 05:23.784
I'll just stay here, and we can start
on that quality time

05:23.890 --> 05:26.450
General Landry wanted us
to spend together.

05:26.993 --> 05:29.393
I've actually come up
with a list of suggestions.

05:29.495 --> 05:33.591
Teal'c, you and Vala head to 333
with SGs 3 and 25.

05:34.267 --> 05:35.757
See if you can figure out
what we're dealing with

05:35.868 --> 05:37.563
without being detected by the locals.

05:37.770 --> 05:39.795
Good plan, boss.

05:39.906 --> 05:43.933
Vala's experience notwithstanding, I want
everyone to exercise extreme caution.

05:44.043 --> 05:46.341
We should find out
whether this is Prior related or not.

05:46.646 --> 05:50.241
Is General Landry not expecting us
at his cabin?

05:50.883 --> 05:52.817
I'll let him know we're going to be
delayed a little bit.

05:52.919 --> 05:55.149
I'm sure Colonel Mitchell will be
very pleased to hear

05:55.254 --> 05:57.882
he's got more special "alone time"
with the General.

06:00.993 --> 06:02.358
- Hey...
- Colonel.

06:02.829 --> 06:07.528
If this is a rare and deadly creature,
we have to try and catch it alive, okay?

06:08.000 --> 06:09.024
That is not our mission.

06:09.135 --> 06:11.399
Do you have any idea what this could
be worth on the open market?

06:11.504 --> 06:13.369
- I do not.
- Okay, okay, wait.

06:14.107 --> 06:17.270
I propose a fifty-fifty split.
I think it's only fair.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.709
I'm the one with all the contacts
to unload something like this.

06:19.812 --> 06:22.178
Anything less than that
would just be, well, plain wrong.

06:25.718 --> 06:28.278
Okay, name your price.

06:28.888 --> 06:31.789
Well, say something.
It's called negotiating?

06:32.859 --> 06:34.417
They're not coming.

06:38.898 --> 06:43.801
Something is eating people on P9J 333.
Teal'c and Vala are checking it out.

06:43.936 --> 06:46.166
- Really? Maybe I should...
- At ease, Colonel.

06:46.272 --> 06:49.002
They've got SG-3 and 5 with them.
They'll be fine.

06:49.575 --> 06:51.236
Still, this was supposed to be
a group thing, sir.

06:51.344 --> 06:52.333
Maybe we should reschedule.

06:52.445 --> 06:54.310
And put away that laptop.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.848
You can't possibly
still be writing mission reports.

06:56.949 --> 06:59.941
And if you are, I don't want to read
anything that long.

07:00.119 --> 07:01.882
To be honest, sir, I finished an hour ago.

07:02.522 --> 07:04.046
I thought so.

07:05.024 --> 07:08.255
You don't have to be so uncomfortable
around me, Mitchell.

07:08.895 --> 07:11.193
Sir, no matter what, you're still my boss.

07:11.397 --> 07:15.629
I just wish you'd relax and enjoy
the peace and quiet of the great outdoors.

07:15.735 --> 07:16.929
(GUN FIRING)

07:17.036 --> 07:18.401
Ignore it.

07:18.905 --> 07:21.066
That was a large caliber, .300 or.338.

07:21.174 --> 07:24.871
They're hunting elk. It's one
of the only drawbacks around here.

07:25.244 --> 07:26.404
Not a fan, sir?

07:27.046 --> 07:28.536
Running around the woods with a gun

07:28.648 --> 07:30.946
never seemed to me
like a good way to unwind.

07:31.751 --> 07:34.982
Looking to kill some innocent creature
just going about its day?

07:35.087 --> 07:38.454
No, I suppose not, sir.
Not if your day job involves

07:38.591 --> 07:40.855
running around the woods carrying a gun.

08:05.051 --> 08:06.245
Recognize the tracks?

08:06.919 --> 08:07.886
I do not.

08:08.988 --> 08:12.082
What we need to do first is dig a deep pit.

08:13.125 --> 08:15.650
This looks like a very good spot.

08:16.963 --> 08:18.760
Why don't you boys get started?

08:20.566 --> 08:21.726
What?

08:22.835 --> 08:24.962
Don't tell me you didn't bring shovels.

08:25.071 --> 08:26.299
(GUN FIRING)

08:27.507 --> 08:29.998
<i>(ON RADIO) This is SG-25 leader!</i>
<i>We need back...</i>

08:32.645 --> 08:34.169
(MEN SCREAMING IN DISTANCE)

08:53.466 --> 08:55.593
It came out of nowhere.

08:55.701 --> 08:57.828
Never seen anything like it.

09:09.815 --> 09:12.181
Remain calm. You will be fine.

09:12.885 --> 09:14.375
(ROARING)

09:15.187 --> 09:16.484
Come.

09:18.090 --> 09:19.523
(THUNDER CRASHING)

09:20.993 --> 09:22.324
Checkmate.

09:22.828 --> 09:24.921
Yep. Too good for me, sir.

09:25.731 --> 09:28.529
Pandering to the ego
of a senior officer, Mitchell?

09:29.602 --> 09:33.868
No, truthfully, I always hated the game,
but if you happen to have a PlayStation,

09:33.973 --> 09:36.703
I will happily kick your ass at SOCOM 3.

09:36.809 --> 09:37.776
Good.

09:38.077 --> 09:40.875
I want you to feel
like you can be honest with me.

09:40.980 --> 09:41.947
Yes, sir.

09:42.615 --> 09:45.607
But I suppose that's easier for me
than it is for you.

09:45.718 --> 09:47.242
I am the General.

09:47.353 --> 09:49.719
No, I think it's probably harder
for you in some ways.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.455
Lonely at the top and all that, huh?

09:52.792 --> 09:56.353
No. More not knowing what people think
of your decisions.

09:58.164 --> 09:59.631
Relax, son.

10:02.001 --> 10:06.165
I was thinking
about what you said to me last week,

10:06.272 --> 10:08.968
about not being in charge of anything.

10:09.075 --> 10:11.339
I'm just used to a clearer
chain of command.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.309
You could have picked
any team you wanted.

10:13.412 --> 10:15.607
You chose to make it
your personal mission

10:15.848 --> 10:20.046
to get Colonel Carter, Dr. Jackson
and Teal'c back together.

10:20.152 --> 10:22.143
That's true, and I wouldn't change that
for the world.

10:22.254 --> 10:24.154
You said you wanted to learn
from the very best.

10:24.256 --> 10:26.690
Yes, I did. It's just...

10:29.261 --> 10:32.025
After almost dying, like I did,

10:32.131 --> 10:35.692
there was a part of me that figured

10:36.435 --> 10:38.198
I could do anything.

10:39.205 --> 10:42.038
Now, since coming to the SGC,
I have learned

10:42.274 --> 10:45.539
that I can't handle any of this
without the rest of SG-1.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.306
I believe in you, Colonel.

10:47.413 --> 10:49.404
- Thank you, sir.
- But we're getting our asses kicked.

10:49.515 --> 10:51.005
- Yes, we are.
- We're not going to get medals

10:51.117 --> 10:52.516
- for participation.
- No, sir.

10:52.618 --> 10:54.609
We win or we die.

10:55.921 --> 10:57.411
I prefer winning.

10:58.224 --> 11:01.887
Now, you started by bringing SG-1
back together.

11:02.028 --> 11:06.192
I need you to continue working together
if we're going to have any hope.

11:06.932 --> 11:09.662
Your job is to make sure that happens.

11:11.203 --> 11:12.431
Very good, sir.

11:25.317 --> 11:26.807
(GROWLING)

11:35.561 --> 11:36.585
Okay.

11:36.896 --> 11:38.158
You want some dessert?

11:40.299 --> 11:41.891
Come and get it.

11:45.371 --> 11:47.566
You could have warned me.
I nearly shot you.

11:47.740 --> 11:49.367
Then you should not have run off
by yourself.

11:49.475 --> 11:51.409
I'm perfectly capable
of looking after myself.

11:51.510 --> 11:52.977
I was trying to get help.

11:53.612 --> 11:54.874
Then why are you not dialing the gate?

11:54.980 --> 11:57.448
Because I thought
I heard something growling.

11:59.118 --> 12:00.710
I hear nothing.

12:01.454 --> 12:03.649
That's probably because
you scared it away. That's good.

12:03.756 --> 12:04.723
(GROWLING)

12:04.857 --> 12:06.085
Now we can...

12:20.139 --> 12:23.074
Well, I'm flattered, but I don't think
we have time for this.

12:23.175 --> 12:24.164
Are you injured?

12:24.276 --> 12:25.243
No, I'm fine.

12:28.547 --> 12:29.514
Thank you.

12:39.692 --> 12:41.592
So much for taking it alive.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.127
Shame, too.

12:44.463 --> 12:47.023
I've never seen anything like this before.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.162
(THUNDER CRASHING)

13:05.050 --> 13:06.074
Sir?

13:18.931 --> 13:19.989
Sir!

13:44.156 --> 13:45.123
Son of a bitch!

13:45.324 --> 13:47.417
Mitchell! What are you doing?

13:50.830 --> 13:52.627
I thought I heard a noise.

13:52.731 --> 13:53.925
Me, too.

13:55.134 --> 13:56.362
(MITCHELL LAUGHS)

13:57.403 --> 13:59.200
Well, that would have been
a hell of a story, sir.

13:59.305 --> 14:00.272
Yeah!

14:01.006 --> 14:02.166
Shotgun, huh?

14:02.608 --> 14:03.973
Thought you didn't like to hunt.

14:04.076 --> 14:05.873
I was up here last summer.

14:06.145 --> 14:08.773
Had a black bear come
right through the kitchen door.

14:09.682 --> 14:10.808
Phones are down.

14:10.950 --> 14:12.042
That happens.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.153
Power could be out for a while, too.

14:16.322 --> 14:18.222
That's quite a storm out there.

14:18.924 --> 14:19.891
Thank you.

14:21.527 --> 14:22.494
Well...

14:23.128 --> 14:24.095
Night, sir.

14:24.296 --> 14:25.263
Night, Mitchell.

14:29.869 --> 14:30.836
General.

14:32.238 --> 14:33.205
Listen,

14:35.241 --> 14:37.903
maybe I'm not the only one around here
who needs to relax.

14:38.310 --> 14:40.744
I'll try not to shoot you before morning.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.242
Thank you, sir. Same here.

14:56.996 --> 14:58.088
What's up, sir?

14:58.497 --> 14:59.896
Going somewhere, Mitchell?

15:00.266 --> 15:01.233
Yes, sir.

15:01.467 --> 15:05.699
The phones are still down, power's out.
I figured we'd head back to reality today.

15:05.804 --> 15:08.773
Unfortunately, the storm washed out
the road into town.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.179
- The road...
- It's the only road in and out of here.

15:15.281 --> 15:17.340
Looks like we're roughing it
until they get it cleared.

15:17.449 --> 15:19.314
Yes, sir,
but you're a powerful Air Force General.

15:19.418 --> 15:20.783
You could order us up a chopper.

15:21.020 --> 15:25.218
We don't use helicopters for our own
personal transportation, Mitchell.

15:25.758 --> 15:26.782
Right, sir.

15:26.892 --> 15:29.952
Besides, I already checked.
There wasn't one available.

15:30.329 --> 15:31.762
We'll be fine.

15:31.997 --> 15:33.828
Just another day or so.

15:37.336 --> 15:39.099
Okay. Thank you.

15:42.908 --> 15:46.400
So, you'll be pleased to hear
that all four members of SG-25

15:46.512 --> 15:47.979
are going to be fine,

15:48.080 --> 15:51.413
thanks in part to my handiwork
with a Goa'uld healing device.

15:51.517 --> 15:53.883
I'm sure Dr. Lam appreciates the help.

15:55.487 --> 15:59.287
I see you haven't gotten over
your phobia of sitting

15:59.391 --> 16:01.416
in General Landry's chair.

16:02.828 --> 16:04.318
What are you doing?

16:04.596 --> 16:07.565
I think it's about time a woman sat here.

16:08.634 --> 16:12.468
Actually, Dr. Elizabeth Weir sat there
all the time when she ran the SGC.

16:12.571 --> 16:13.833
She did?

16:14.540 --> 16:15.768
Good for her.

16:22.514 --> 16:26.712
So, now that the deadly creature
of P3-whatever has been dealt with,

16:26.819 --> 16:27.843
when do we go?

16:27.953 --> 16:30.012
I just got a call from
the Silver Creek Sheriff's Department.

16:30.122 --> 16:31.987
Apparently, there was a bad storm
up there last night,

16:32.091 --> 16:33.649
and the road leading up to the area
where the cabin is

16:33.759 --> 16:36.250
washed out
and won't be reopened till tomorrow.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.422
How unfortunate.

16:39.531 --> 16:41.123
I'm sure Colonel Mitchell agrees.

16:41.300 --> 16:43.495
I'm sure the boys are having
the time of their lives,

16:43.602 --> 16:45.126
getting up to all sorts of mischief.

16:45.404 --> 16:46.769
Oh, yeah, I can just imagine.

16:47.873 --> 16:49.363
You're in for a treat, Colonel.

16:49.475 --> 16:51.500
Yes, sir. I can see that.

16:52.644 --> 16:57.104
The fulvous whistling duck. Very rare.
Endangered, actually.

16:57.216 --> 16:59.275
Only spotted one once in my life.

16:59.385 --> 17:03.287
And as good fortune would have it,
their mating season is right now,

17:03.455 --> 17:05.548
and they love to come out
after a good rain.

17:06.325 --> 17:07.656
That's a good one, sir.

17:08.794 --> 17:11.058
You know what? The hat really sells it.

17:14.600 --> 17:15.965
Oh, you're serious.

17:17.069 --> 17:22.598
Well, sir, as tempting
as a duck that whistles sounds,

17:24.109 --> 17:27.010
I was thinking about going for a run,
work off some of that beer from last night.

17:27.112 --> 17:30.013
You're missing the opportunity
of a lifetime, Mitchell.

17:31.683 --> 17:33.275
Are you making it an order?

17:33.385 --> 17:35.979
Birding isn't something you have to have
in your soul, son.

17:36.722 --> 17:39.088
You have to come to it on your own.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.892
Well, I gotta be honest with you, sir.

17:43.328 --> 17:45.262
I don't know that I have it in me.

17:45.464 --> 17:48.126
The plaintive mating call of this duck

17:48.233 --> 17:50.724
is unlike anything you've ever heard.

17:52.805 --> 17:54.670
(IMITATES MATING CALL)

18:07.086 --> 18:08.747
Permission to leave, sir?

18:09.755 --> 18:10.722
Granted.

18:11.156 --> 18:12.987
Thank you. Here I go.

18:31.176 --> 18:32.575
How's it coming?

18:32.678 --> 18:35.112
Dr. Redden has just begun
her examination.

18:35.881 --> 18:37.712
She appears to be quite knowledgeable.

18:37.816 --> 18:40.683
She should be. She's been heading up
the xenology unit at Area 51

18:40.786 --> 18:42.048
for several years now.

18:44.289 --> 18:46.416
And there goes my need for lunch.

18:46.692 --> 18:49.889
REDDEN: Body cavity contains
mammal-like organs.

18:50.429 --> 18:53.227
Unnatural-looking tumors
appear prevalent.

18:54.032 --> 18:55.829
Let's get this out.

18:55.934 --> 18:57.731
(BEEPING)

18:59.471 --> 19:00.904
What's going on?

19:01.006 --> 19:04.737
Scans are picking up low levels
of radiation coming from within the body.

19:04.910 --> 19:08.368
The location is somewhere
in the stomach lining here.

19:11.517 --> 19:14.748
It looks like there's some kind of
extraneous sac or abscess

19:14.853 --> 19:16.616
attached to the stomach wall itself.

19:16.722 --> 19:18.053
Can I have a scalpel, please?

19:18.157 --> 19:19.124
Thank you.

19:19.258 --> 19:21.021
Attempting to remove it now.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.318
Come on, you.

19:31.737 --> 19:32.931
Son of a...

19:42.881 --> 19:44.314
Thank you.

19:58.964 --> 20:00.625
MAN: Help! Help!

20:03.001 --> 20:03.968
Get out of here!

20:04.069 --> 20:06.094
Watch where you're pointing that weapon.

20:06.838 --> 20:07.805
What's wrong?

20:08.006 --> 20:11.203
(STUTTERS) Something attacked us, man.
It came out of nowhere.

20:11.910 --> 20:13.878
- It attacked my buddy Mike.
- All right, all right.

20:13.979 --> 20:15.378
Take me to Mike.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.518
This way.

20:44.843 --> 20:48.506
REDDEN: So it seems our large dead friend
up in the lab used to look like this.

20:49.314 --> 20:53.876
Native to P9J 333.
A docile herbivore, very shy,

20:53.986 --> 20:56.011
and completely harmless,
according to the locals.

20:56.121 --> 20:58.612
Well, it seems one of them, at least,
has had an identity crisis.

20:59.091 --> 21:02.583
Yes, well, something caused
rapid and extensive mutation.

21:02.728 --> 21:05.026
That something, I take it,
was creature number two.

21:05.130 --> 21:06.097
Exactly.

21:06.298 --> 21:07.492
This little fellow

21:07.899 --> 21:11.198
apparently gives off a type of radiation
we've never encountered before.

21:11.303 --> 21:13.897
It lodged itself in the stomach lining
of the host creature

21:14.006 --> 21:15.974
and began altering the host's DNA.

21:16.074 --> 21:19.976
Yet the inhabitants of P9J 333
claim to have never seen or heard

21:20.078 --> 21:22.638
of any such mutation to any of the animals
on their planet.

21:22.814 --> 21:24.782
Oh, well, I strongly doubt
that our smaller friend there

21:24.883 --> 21:26.612
is indigenous to the planet.

21:26.985 --> 21:28.850
So the question is,

21:28.954 --> 21:30.581
how did it get there?

21:32.824 --> 21:36.590
It was an animal, most likely a grizzly,
protecting its young.

21:36.695 --> 21:38.253
The witness is pretty freaked out.

21:38.363 --> 21:41.526
His friend just got mauled to death.
He said it was a bear.

21:41.700 --> 21:42.894
He said "a bear or something."

21:43.001 --> 21:44.866
I know it can get boring up here, Wade.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.460
It doesn't mean
you have to go making up things

21:46.571 --> 21:48.766
that are gonna get the locals all excited.

21:49.141 --> 21:52.599
(CARS HONKING AND MEN HOOTING)

21:52.944 --> 21:54.343
Guess it's a little late for that.

21:54.446 --> 21:57.506
Seal off the park before the place
turns into a shooting gallery.

21:57.616 --> 22:00.585
Look, I only got three deputies
working for me,

22:00.686 --> 22:02.620
plus half a dozen volunteer rangers.

22:02.721 --> 22:04.450
This is hunting season.

22:04.556 --> 22:08.048
If I got a mad grizzly on the loose,
I need it dealt with.

22:08.727 --> 22:09.716
Best that I can hope for

22:09.828 --> 22:12.729
is that somebody kills whatever did this
before it kills again.

22:23.442 --> 22:26.036
Lieutenant. You reported an emergency.

22:27.045 --> 22:28.012
What happened?

22:28.213 --> 22:30.204
Colonel, we've got a problem.

22:40.592 --> 22:44.619
There have been no attacks of this nature
reported by any Jaffa settlements.

22:44.763 --> 22:47.755
None of our other offworld allies
are reporting any such contacts, either.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.964
Except we now have an attack
by yet another predatory creature,

22:51.069 --> 22:53.060
this time on a completely different planet.

22:53.171 --> 22:55.662
Not to mention a world
that's already been converted by the Ori.

22:55.774 --> 22:59.301
If the inhabitants of P2R 866
have already accepted Origin,

22:59.411 --> 23:03.040
there would be no need for the Priors
to inflict this creature upon them.

23:03.148 --> 23:05.048
Exactly. Which means that the Ori

23:05.150 --> 23:07.277
may have absolutely nothing to do
with these creatures.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.650
- So where are they coming from?
- I don't know.

23:09.755 --> 23:11.313
But so far, to the best of our knowledge,

23:11.423 --> 23:13.584
they're only showing up
on worlds we visit.

23:17.462 --> 23:19.896
This sheriff doesn't think we've got
a Bigfoot on our hands, does he?

23:19.998 --> 23:21.056
He's a decent enough guy.

23:21.166 --> 23:23.259
Probably just watches
too much television.

23:23.602 --> 23:25.467
On the other hand, we have seen

23:25.771 --> 23:27.602
real, live alien monsters.

23:27.706 --> 23:29.435
He doesn't know that.

23:29.808 --> 23:30.775
True.

23:31.510 --> 23:34.570
But he could just be looking
for his 15 minutes.

23:34.679 --> 23:36.647
He's not that sort of man.

23:37.082 --> 23:39.550
Well it certainly would bring
some publicity to the area.

23:39.651 --> 23:40.618
Bump up tourism.

23:40.752 --> 23:43.346
Whatever his motivation is,
he sure got everyone's attention.

23:43.455 --> 23:45.821
We've got a bunch of drunken hunters
out there, all hyped up,

23:45.924 --> 23:47.824
looking for revenge and glory.

23:47.926 --> 23:50.019
So are we siding with the hunters?

23:50.662 --> 23:51.629
Or the bear?

23:52.264 --> 23:54.732
I don't want to see anyone else get hurt.

23:55.400 --> 23:56.367
Just checking, sir.

23:59.004 --> 24:00.494
This I like, sir.

24:00.639 --> 24:02.197
A man is dead, Colonel.

24:02.541 --> 24:04.736
Yes, sir, I know, and I do sympathize.

24:04.876 --> 24:07.003
It's just, you keep telling me to relax.

24:09.781 --> 24:12.716
It has nothing to do
with being here with you, sir.

24:13.185 --> 24:16.120
Truth is, if I sit around
with nothing to do, I get antsy.

24:17.389 --> 24:20.483
I'm much more at ease offworld,
in the thick of it.

24:20.659 --> 24:23.753
I was flying air support out of Bien Hoa.

24:24.429 --> 24:28.388
Caught some triple-A in my left engine
and I had to eject.

24:29.201 --> 24:32.693
Ended up landing somewhere
near the Laotian border,

24:32.871 --> 24:34.668
well north of the DMZ.

24:35.640 --> 24:38.268
Cut my knee up pretty good
in the process.

24:39.110 --> 24:40.441
I was lost,

24:41.213 --> 24:44.671
bleeding badly, no food, no radio.

24:46.251 --> 24:48.651
Half a battalion
of North Vietnamese regulars

24:48.753 --> 24:50.812
were combing the jungle looking for me.

24:51.656 --> 24:53.647
Tracked me day and night.

24:54.793 --> 24:56.818
Followed my blood trail.

24:58.530 --> 25:00.464
Obviously, you got away, sir.

25:01.967 --> 25:03.594
Took me eight days.

25:04.736 --> 25:06.704
So that's why you don't like to hunt.

25:08.106 --> 25:10.097
I never felt more alive.

25:10.675 --> 25:11.733
Yes, sir.

25:12.410 --> 25:14.776
But I wouldn't call it relaxing.

25:15.780 --> 25:17.805
Well, I'm kind of twisted that way, sir.

25:31.563 --> 25:32.621
<i>MAN ON RADIO: Sheriff Stokes, come in.</i>

25:32.731 --> 25:35.029
<i>We're about a mile northwest</i>
<i>of Silver Creek Junction.</i>

25:35.133 --> 25:37.863
<i>We found another body.</i>
<i>It's been torn to shreds.</i>

25:38.403 --> 25:39.461
Colonel, respond.

25:41.640 --> 25:42.902
I hear it, sir.

26:00.759 --> 26:01.726
Colonel?

26:03.461 --> 26:05.019
Victim number two.

26:13.538 --> 26:15.972
The first mission, to P9J 333,

26:16.074 --> 26:18.907
was simply to observe
and initiate first contact with the locals

26:19.044 --> 26:20.671
should they reject the Ori.

26:20.779 --> 26:24.408
The second mission, to P2R 866,
was purely covert surveillance

26:24.516 --> 26:26.313
of an already converted planet.

26:26.418 --> 26:27.783
Two completely different missions,

26:27.886 --> 26:30.582
both to worlds not inhabited
by scary creatures of any kind.

26:30.689 --> 26:34.455
Right. However, there was one single
common element to both missions.

26:34.559 --> 26:37.995
Both required teams to remain
inconspicuous. Stealth was key.

26:38.530 --> 26:41.294
Then both teams would have been
required to use a Sodan cloaking device

26:41.399 --> 26:43.196
- in order to remain hidden.
- Exactly.

26:43.301 --> 26:46.395
And we tested them for safety and started
deploying them on missions such as these

26:46.504 --> 26:47.732
just over a week ago.

26:47.839 --> 26:50.239
You think there's some sort of malfunction
with the devices?

26:50.342 --> 26:52.003
Yes, but we have another problem.

26:52.477 --> 26:55.742
I requested a complete recall
of all the Sodan cloaking devices,

26:55.847 --> 26:57.940
including the ones still at Area 51.

26:58.550 --> 27:01.110
Turns out one of them is missing.

27:09.227 --> 27:12.060
No abnormal energy readings,
no power spikes.

27:12.163 --> 27:14.131
All systems appear to be normal.

27:14.232 --> 27:15.961
Looks like that one checks out, too.

27:18.570 --> 27:19.559
How's it going?

27:19.671 --> 27:20.638
Nothing yet.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.301
Any word from Area 51?

27:23.408 --> 27:25.535
Yeah. Agent Barrett called in
about an hour ago.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.168
Said his team has detained everyone

27:27.278 --> 27:30.270
<i>who had security clearance to the lab</i>
<i>where the devices were being held.</i>

27:30.782 --> 27:33.046
We should have more answers
after he's finished questioning them.

27:33.318 --> 27:34.945
So he's made a full recovery, then?

27:35.053 --> 27:36.884
Well, he's cleared for duty,
but he still feels

27:36.988 --> 27:38.478
<i>responsible for what happened.</i>

27:38.590 --> 27:40.649
<i>VALA: Well, he was brainwashed.</i>
<i>It's hardly his fault.</i>

27:40.759 --> 27:43.751
Still, he's determined
to find out how it happened

27:43.862 --> 27:45.329
and catch those responsible.

27:45.430 --> 27:46.897
<i>It is ironic that, not so long ago,</i>

27:46.998 --> 27:48.966
the mere presence of the Goa'uld on Earth

27:49.067 --> 27:50.398
would have been cause for great concern.

27:50.769 --> 27:51.736
Seriously.

27:52.303 --> 27:55.067
Who'd ever think
that we'd have bigger fish to fry?

27:55.807 --> 27:58.173
Or that you'd use the word "ironic"
in a sentence?

27:58.910 --> 28:00.104
Indeed.

28:03.214 --> 28:04.306
<i>I am ready.</i>

28:04.416 --> 28:05.508
Okay. Go for it.

28:10.522 --> 28:11.750
Nothing.

28:11.990 --> 28:12.979
(BEEPING)

28:13.091 --> 28:14.524
Wait a second.

28:14.626 --> 28:16.253
There's elevated radiation coming

28:16.361 --> 28:18.226
<i>from within the area of the cloaking field.</i>

28:20.198 --> 28:21.790
<i>Levels are climbing.</i>

28:43.688 --> 28:45.212
A lot of activity out here, sir.

28:45.323 --> 28:49.817
I told you. The last thing we need is
for this place to turn into the O.K. Corral.

28:49.928 --> 28:50.895
(GUNS FIRING)

28:51.029 --> 28:53.463
Or a vice-presidential bird hunt.

28:56.334 --> 28:57.460
Hold fire!

28:57.569 --> 28:58.831
Cease fire!

29:00.071 --> 29:02.665
You boys want to tell me
what you're shooting at?

29:02.774 --> 29:04.503
We saw something moving in there.

29:06.077 --> 29:08.443
Hey, man, you crazy?
Where the hell's he going?

29:31.236 --> 29:32.567
Turn that thing off.

29:36.474 --> 29:37.805
Help me.

29:41.846 --> 29:43.143
So you're sure you're okay?

29:43.248 --> 29:44.408
I am fine, Colonel Carter.

29:44.549 --> 29:47.313
No headaches? No nausea?
Nothing that might indicate

29:47.418 --> 29:49.750
early symptoms
of sudden onset monsterism?

29:50.188 --> 29:51.177
I am fine.

29:51.289 --> 29:53.519
Actually, you are.

29:54.459 --> 29:58.418
There's no signs of radiation poisoning,
no evidence of genetic manipulation...

29:59.564 --> 30:01.395
I'm guessing this creature, whatever it is,

30:01.499 --> 30:04.991
requires sustained close contact
in order to affect its victim's DNA.

30:05.103 --> 30:07.230
Well, that's reassuring, for all of us.

30:07.338 --> 30:08.805
Well, we're running some tests on it
right now,

30:08.907 --> 30:10.008
but I would like to know more
about what actually happened.

30:10.008 --> 30:11.270
But I would like to know more
about what actually happened.

30:11.376 --> 30:14.004
You said it just appeared
inside the cloaking field?

30:14.179 --> 30:16.773
And then it just sat there like a lump.

30:16.881 --> 30:19.907
The one inside the stomach
of the mutated creature was quite active.

30:20.318 --> 30:22.218
Yeah, I noticed. It practically attacked me.

30:22.353 --> 30:25.914
And this one has actually been more
active recently in its containment tank.

30:26.057 --> 30:29.720
I suppose it's possible it was temporarily
stunned by its transition to our dimension.

30:29.828 --> 30:30.795
I'm sorry?

30:30.895 --> 30:32.954
Well, that would explain
why the people using the cloaks

30:33.064 --> 30:34.725
haven't been attacked by the creatures.

30:34.833 --> 30:37.563
No, no, I meant
the "transition to our dimension" part.

30:38.336 --> 30:41.271
The Sodan cloaking device emits
an energy field around the wearer

30:41.372 --> 30:45.365
that puts them slightly out of phase
with our normal dimension of space-time.

30:45.476 --> 30:48.934
Essentially, whoever is in the field
is accessing a pocket of subspace,

30:49.047 --> 30:50.776
making them virtually undetectable.

30:50.882 --> 30:53.851
So you think this creature
is from an alternate dimension,

30:53.952 --> 30:56.011
and is essentially bleeding through?

30:56.120 --> 30:57.417
Yeah. It's definitely possible.

30:57.522 --> 31:01.117
Ancient technology has allowed us
to see extra-dimensional life forms before.

31:01.226 --> 31:04.627
The Sodan were using these devices
for hundreds of years.

31:05.063 --> 31:07.725
You'd think there'd at least be a label
on the side in bold print that says,

31:07.832 --> 31:10.596
"Beware, may cause deadly,
extra-dimensional, radioactive,

31:10.702 --> 31:12.829
"monster-causing creature to appear."

31:13.204 --> 31:15.798
Or, at least "Danger"
would have been nice.

31:16.074 --> 31:19.566
Perhaps the Sodan were not aware
of such a flaw in the technology.

31:19.844 --> 31:23.780
CARTER: It's possible this wasn't even a
problem until we started using the devices.

31:25.416 --> 31:27.316
I think I know why this is happening.

31:31.489 --> 31:33.013
Actually, it went straight through.

31:33.124 --> 31:34.989
Congratulations. You're going to be fine.

31:35.093 --> 31:36.924
What? I've been shot!

31:37.462 --> 31:39.362
Yeah, you have. Hurts, don't it?

31:39.998 --> 31:41.727
Don't worry, I had worse.

31:41.933 --> 31:44.731
I'm bleeding to death here!
I need an ambulance.

31:45.503 --> 31:48.301
Yeah, I can do that, as soon as I find out

31:48.940 --> 31:52.637
what you're doing running around in
the woods with a Sodan cloaking device.

31:53.378 --> 31:55.107
You're going to let me die?

31:56.681 --> 31:57.705
I figure

31:59.450 --> 32:00.917
you're connected to the Trust.

32:01.085 --> 32:02.052
Am I right?

32:02.720 --> 32:05.280
Orders to spy on General Landry,
myself and SG-1?

32:05.623 --> 32:07.750
Please, just get me to a hospital.

32:08.059 --> 32:11.222
See, obviously, you're not a Goa'uld,
otherwise you'd just heal yourself.

32:11.796 --> 32:13.127
What are you talking about?

32:13.531 --> 32:16.056
Snakes. Snakes in people's heads.
Evil snakes,

32:16.768 --> 32:18.497
controlling their host bodies
with megalomaniac

32:18.603 --> 32:19.968
take-over-the-galaxy delusions.

32:20.071 --> 32:21.732
I know what a Goa'uld is.

32:21.839 --> 32:23.932
Do you know you're working for one?

32:25.009 --> 32:27.341
That's who's running the Trust these days.

32:27.845 --> 32:29.710
- You're crazy, man.
- Yeah.

32:30.782 --> 32:32.682
That's what they keep telling me.

32:32.951 --> 32:35.351
You know, they really should give you
a personal shield

32:35.453 --> 32:37.421
to go with that cloaking device.

32:38.423 --> 32:40.084
And half a brain.

32:40.625 --> 32:43.458
We found a car filled with surveillance
and recording equipment

32:43.561 --> 32:45.654
about half a mile from here.

32:45.763 --> 32:48.789
I figure the most he learned
is that Mitchell is terrible at chess

32:48.900 --> 32:51.596
and has some form of sleep apnea.
What else have you learned?

32:52.570 --> 32:56.336
Well, sir, the reason the creatures
are entering our dimension is our fault.

32:56.607 --> 32:57.574
How's that?

32:57.809 --> 32:59.470
<i>When we first started using</i>
<i>the Sodan devices,</i>

32:59.577 --> 33:00.566
<i>we noticed that they emitted</i>

33:00.678 --> 33:02.407
a significant amount of radiation.

33:02.580 --> 33:04.514
This is different from the radiation
given off

33:04.615 --> 33:06.173
by the inter-dimensional creatures?

33:06.284 --> 33:08.115
<i>Yes, sir, but not unrelated.</i>

33:08.219 --> 33:10.813
We made modifications
to shield the radioactive emissions

33:10.922 --> 33:13.288
in order to make the devices
safer for human use.

33:13.391 --> 33:16.724
I'm guessing there was a practical reason
for the radioactive output.

33:16.928 --> 33:19.863
<i>Dr. Redden tested the creatures</i>
<i>for a reaction to the radiation</i>

33:19.964 --> 33:22.398
given off by the unshielded
cloaking devices.

33:22.800 --> 33:23.858
They're repelled by it.

33:24.469 --> 33:27.302
And the Sodan would have been protected
from the radioactivity

33:27.405 --> 33:29.066
because of their symbiotes.

33:29.173 --> 33:31.038
<i>Exactly, which is why they never had</i>
<i>this problem.</i>

33:31.809 --> 33:34.107
We thought the radiation was
a coincidental byproduct

33:34.212 --> 33:35.270
of the technology.

33:35.613 --> 33:38.047
<i>When it was actually performing</i>
<i>a vital function.</i>

33:38.416 --> 33:43.080
Do we have any idea how frequent
this dimensional breach might be?

33:43.388 --> 33:45.856
No, sir. It appears to be
a random occurrence.

33:47.125 --> 33:48.888
But given how long the Trust operative

33:48.993 --> 33:50.984
was using the Sodan device
to stay hidden,

33:51.896 --> 33:54.729
<i>I'd say that whatever's on the loose</i>
<i>in the woods around the cabin</i>

33:54.832 --> 33:57.266
<i>is probably a lot worse than a grizzly.</i>

34:02.373 --> 34:05.035
Two hunters dead,
and now a guy with no ID.

34:05.843 --> 34:07.743
You want to bring me into the loop
here, Colonel?

34:07.879 --> 34:10.712
Guy was in the wrong place at the wrong
time, got shot for his troubles.

34:10.815 --> 34:13.283
Bound to happen with all these yahoos
running around the woods with guns.

34:13.418 --> 34:15.249
Then why am I not being allowed
to question him?

34:15.353 --> 34:17.685
Because the Air Force is
taking over this investigation

34:17.789 --> 34:19.586
in the interest of national security.

34:19.757 --> 34:20.724
That's why.

34:24.195 --> 34:25.822
So just a grizzly bear, huh?

34:27.331 --> 34:31.597
Since when does the Air Force go after
a bear in the name of national security?

34:31.702 --> 34:33.727
There's nothing for you
to be concerned about, Wade.

34:33.838 --> 34:36.466
Things will be back to normal
around here in no time.

(MARINES SHOUTING)

34:59.664 --> 35:00.961
Damn it.

35:13.377 --> 35:15.470
MITCHELL: So we're talking about
a little critter from a different dimension

35:15.580 --> 35:17.707
that burrows into a big critter,

35:18.082 --> 35:20.107
turning him into a rampaging monster.

35:20.384 --> 35:21.351
In a nutshell.

35:21.719 --> 35:23.880
Nice. How do we find it?

35:24.522 --> 35:26.888
Well, I've calibrated a number
of handheld scanners to pick up

35:26.991 --> 35:28.856
the creature's radioactive
energy signature.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.827
We should be able to track it
within a 300-meter range.

35:32.063 --> 35:34.827
We've also devised
a radioactive isotope package

35:34.932 --> 35:36.092
that gives off an energy wave

35:36.200 --> 35:38.828
similar to the ones emitted
by the Sodan cloaking devices.

35:39.036 --> 35:41.664
We're air-dropping them in a perimeter
around the park.

35:41.873 --> 35:43.773
It should stop the creature
from getting too far.

35:43.875 --> 35:45.172
Isn't that dangerous for us?

35:45.276 --> 35:47.210
Only if you come within 100 meters
of the package.

35:47.311 --> 35:49.040
They have a decay rate
that will leave them inert

35:49.147 --> 35:50.409
in less than six hours.

35:50.515 --> 35:51.846
It'll be dark soon.

35:52.316 --> 35:53.783
We can't let this thing get away.

35:54.418 --> 35:58.411
VALA: Right, so obviously, rule number one
when hunting savage beasts like this

35:58.523 --> 36:01.390
is to never actually crawl
through the forest looking for them,

36:01.492 --> 36:05.360
especially at night.
Always find a way to lure them to you.

36:05.663 --> 36:07.722
So I suggest the best plan of attack

36:07.932 --> 36:12.335
would be to plant these isotope packages
here and here...

36:16.841 --> 36:18.274
Or whatever you want.

36:18.643 --> 36:20.201
You'll operate in teams of four.

36:20.344 --> 36:23.643
Each team will conduct grid sweeps,
starting here.

36:23.748 --> 36:25.716
No more than 300 meters apart,

36:25.816 --> 36:28.046
radio contact every 10 minutes.

36:28.519 --> 36:30.646
- That's brilliant. Or...
- You have your orders.

36:30.855 --> 36:31.822
Move out.

36:34.525 --> 36:36.459
But they didn't hear the rest of my plan.

36:36.561 --> 36:38.028
We'll call it Plan B.

36:52.510 --> 36:54.068
This won't work, you know.

36:54.612 --> 36:57.740
All I'm saying is, why not take advantage
of my vast experience,

36:57.848 --> 36:59.475
instead of leaving it up to...

"if there is no army to follow it."

37:10.861 --> 37:13.159
It is one, we are many.

37:13.731 --> 37:15.756
That is why we will prevail.

We got a bogey just northeast
of your position. Can you zero in on it?

37:42.593 --> 37:44.458

38:18.629 --> 38:20.688
Look, no creature, no matter how vicious,

38:20.798 --> 38:22.459
is stupid enough
to attack a group of this size,

38:22.566 --> 38:25.228
so, trust me, we've probably scared it off.

38:25.636 --> 38:26.830

Holy Hannah, did you see that thing?

38:42.953 --> 38:44.614
Do you think we scared it off now?

38:46.057 --> 38:48.321
No, I think we pissed it off.

40:51.949 --> 40:53.109
A queen.

40:54.819 --> 40:57.344
General, good timing. Colonel Mitchell
is about to run out of chips.

40:57.455 --> 40:58.945
We need new blood.

40:59.223 --> 41:00.190
Any word, sir?

41:00.758 --> 41:02.851
Final ground sweeps have come up empty,

41:02.993 --> 41:07.191
and although it is a big park,
our scanners do have a limited range,

41:07.898 --> 41:10.492
so we're dropping a fresh
radioactive perimeter

41:10.601 --> 41:13.934
and sealing off the area for another week
as a precaution.

41:14.038 --> 41:16.768
I think it's unlikely
that there's a third creature, sir.

41:16.874 --> 41:18.136
Care to place odds on that?

41:18.809 --> 41:20.037
I'm not much of a gambler.

41:20.144 --> 41:21.611
That is obvious.

41:24.114 --> 41:25.274
Okay!

41:26.851 --> 41:28.216
River comes up...

41:28.486 --> 41:29.475
King of spades.

41:29.587 --> 41:32.784
Possible Royal Marriage or King Kong
in the works.

41:32.923 --> 41:35.824
There's way too much Poker Channel
going on here.

41:39.797 --> 41:41.059
I'm out.

41:42.633 --> 41:44.396
I'm all in.

41:48.005 --> 41:48.972
I'm out.

41:58.349 --> 41:59.907
A true warrior

42:01.051 --> 42:02.484
knows when to fold 'em.

42:04.088 --> 42:05.055
Really?

42:05.489 --> 42:06.456
I won?

42:07.024 --> 42:08.491
I was totally bluffing!

42:08.592 --> 42:10.150
Well played, Colonel!

42:10.494 --> 42:11.461
Thank you, sir.

42:11.595 --> 42:13.688
A true warrior knows when to hold 'em.

42:13.797 --> 42:15.287
She took you downtown, homeboy.

42:15.399 --> 42:17.264
I'm glad to see
you're all having a good time.

42:17.368 --> 42:19.666
Yes, sir. Last night was the best time
I've had since...

42:19.904 --> 42:23.203
I don't know when, the look on your face
when I said, "Sir! Get down!"

42:28.412 --> 42:29.379
What?

42:30.381 --> 42:33.248
A hundred times,
the man has told me to relax.

42:33.551 --> 42:34.609
Not that much.

42:37.288 --> 42:38.255
Yes, sir.

42:39.156 --> 42:41.420
Well, it's good to see you relaxing, too, sir.

42:43.694 --> 42:45.889
Right. Now...

42:51.001 --> 42:52.229
Deal me in.
