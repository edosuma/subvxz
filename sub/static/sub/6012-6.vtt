A telegram for Lady Edith.

00:45.253 --> 00:47.839
Oh, you should go.

00:49.841 --> 00:51.926
(GENERAL CHATTER)

00:57.181 --> 00:59.267
- What about you?
- No, not really.

01:03.896 --> 01:05.982
(CLEARS THROAT)

01:10.611 --> 01:14.532
- I don't want to disturb you. - Don't be
silly. You couldn't disturb me.

01:14.574 --> 01:16.659
Thank you, Baxter.

01:21.163 --> 01:25.585
- I wouldn't have bothered you. - Stop
talking like that and move back in.

01:25.626 --> 01:29.797
- I only came to tell you that Edith's
about to receive some bad news. - What?

01:29.839 --> 01:32.425
- How do you know? - Her editor's on
his way to see her this aftrnoon...

01:32.466 --> 01:34.468
It's what we've been waiting for.

01:34.510 --> 01:38.181
However much you expect it,
it's still painful when it arrives.

01:40.892 --> 01:42.977
(DOOR CLOSES)

01:43.019 --> 01:46.606
- You don't think it's good news?
- If it were, he'd have telephoned.

01:46.647 --> 01:49.984
- When you see Madge, warn her.
- Are you all set for tomorrow?

01:50.026 --> 01:52.695
- What's this?
- I'm going to see the cottage again,

01:52.737 --> 01:54.739
and then I have to make up my mind.

01:54.780 --> 01:57.700
- Mrs Hughes is coming with me.
- I'll leave you to it.

01:59.493 --> 02:02.830
- What's it like, this cottage?
- I don't know.

02:02.872 --> 02:05.291
You can ask me after tomorrow.

02:05.333 --> 02:07.793
Unless you want to come with us?

02:07.835 --> 02:11.214
- She wouldn't want me.
- You know that's not true.

02:11.255 --> 02:13.966
It'd be good to
bury the memorial business.

02:14.008 --> 02:16.677
See what she says -
but don't force her.

02:18.596 --> 02:21.933
Of course it's terrible,
but what did she think he was doing?

02:21.974 --> 02:25.061
- Living in a tree?
- You mustn't make jokes, Milady.

02:25.102 --> 02:28.272
Only in here. I'll be
as solemn as a church when I go down.

02:29.315 --> 02:31.400
No, I am sorry, truly.

02:31.442 --> 02:34.278
He was a nice man.
Though what he saw in Edith, I...

02:36.030 --> 02:39.408
Goodness. The York and Ainsty
are holding a point-to-point

02:39.450 --> 02:41.536
at Canningford Grange on Saturday,

02:41.577 --> 02:45.248
and Mr Blake has persuaded Lord
Gillingham they should ride in it.

02:45.289 --> 02:50.211
- Don't you have to follow the hunt to
be eligible? - They've been out with
the York and Ainsty.

02:50.253 --> 02:54.841
- They'll have wangled it. I might join
them. - Are ladies allowed to race with
the men?

02:54.882 --> 02:58.302
It changed just before the war.
Papa thinks it terribly fast.

02:58.344 --> 03:01.514
Do they want to stay here,
Mr Blake and Lord Gillingham?

03:01.556 --> 03:06.143
They want to meet at Canningford
and then come here that night. Golly.

03:06.185 --> 03:09.522
Why would His Lordship come here
after you've broken it off?

03:09.564 --> 03:12.358
Because he still won't accept
I know my own mind.

03:12.400 --> 03:16.237
(SIGHS) Anna, do you think
I'm looking rather frumpy?

03:16.279 --> 03:18.155
- Certainly not, Milady.
- Hm.

03:18.197 --> 03:21.033
I'm tempted to remind them
of what they're missing.

03:21.075 --> 03:23.160
You'd never be that heartless.

03:25.830 --> 03:30.334
Shrimpie says he's narrowing the list
of possibilities,

03:30.376 --> 03:33.296
and he thinks he'll track her down
before long.

03:33.337 --> 03:36.799
- Are you going to tell the prince?
- I think I should, don't you?

03:38.050 --> 03:42.513
- Would you like me to come?
- No. I'll go alone this time.

03:42.555 --> 03:44.640
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

03:44.682 --> 03:49.312
Oh. I'm ever so sorry, Milady,
I didn't know you had company.

03:49.353 --> 03:53.316
This is Mrs Crawley, my cousin.
You'll find she's a frequent visitor.

03:53.357 --> 03:55.359
- Good day, Madam.
- Hello.

03:55.401 --> 03:58.613
Denker is my new maid.
She's trying to find her way around.

03:58.654 --> 04:02.200
- Did you have a question, Denker?
- It can wait, Milady.

04:03.326 --> 04:05.912
Well, I was going to ask you about
the luggage,

04:05.953 --> 04:08.456
and which cases you prefer
when you travel.

04:08.497 --> 04:11.834
Why, I don't travel much these days.

04:11.876 --> 04:14.420
Why don't you ask Spratt?
He'll help you.

04:14.462 --> 04:16.589
Oh, he'll help me, will he? Hmph.

04:16.630 --> 04:18.798
That's good to know.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.927
If you'll excuse me.

04:22.261 --> 04:23.804
(DOOR SHUTS)

04:23.846 --> 04:27.808
Honestly, Mr Barrow, take some time
off and have a rest. You look awful.

04:27.850 --> 04:32.021
- I'm fine, thank you. I've never felt
better. - You've never looked worse.

04:32.063 --> 04:34.899
Since you are indifferent
to my opinions, Mr Bates,

04:34.941 --> 04:38.945
- it's only fitting I am indifferent to
yours. - I'm nipping to the cottage.

04:38.986 --> 04:43.074
- I've left my button box there.
- (BELL TINKLES) Oh, that's Lady Mary.

04:43.115 --> 04:46.494
- She must want something before lunch.
- You go, I'll fetch it.

04:46.536 --> 04:48.412
Would you? Thank you.

04:54.502 --> 04:58.548
- Do we know when he'll get here?
- Later this afternoon.

05:00.091 --> 05:04.887
- I should have some drawings
for you all to look at before long.
- What sort of drawings?

05:04.929 --> 05:10.351
- Ideas for how we could renovate
the run-down village houses.
- Why is there such a building spurt?

05:10.393 --> 05:13.604
The war showed how half
the population were badly housed.

05:13.646 --> 05:17.525
They were shocked by how unhealthy
some of the new recruits were.

05:17.567 --> 05:20.820
"You cannot expect to get an A1
population out of C3 homes."

05:20.862 --> 05:23.155
- Who said that?
- I think it was on a poster.

05:24.115 --> 05:27.243
I heard from Charles today.
He and Tony are competing

05:27.285 --> 05:30.079
in the point-to-point at Canningford
on Saturday.

05:30.121 --> 05:32.456
- Atticus was talking about that.
- Atticus?

05:32.498 --> 05:36.335
- Atticus Aldridge, the chap I met in
York. - Has he become a friend?

05:36.377 --> 05:40.173
Yes. His parents, the Sinderbys,
have bought Canningford Grange.

05:40.214 --> 05:43.759
Now they're wooing the county.
Lord Sinderby's rich, isn't he?

05:43.801 --> 05:45.845
Who'd take it on if they weren't?

05:45.887 --> 05:49.557
- Why don't we all go, make a day of
it? - We could ask Granny and Isobel

05:49.599 --> 05:53.060
and take the children. Shall I tell
Charles they can stay here?

05:53.102 --> 05:55.188
Course, if you want them to.

05:59.942 --> 06:04.864
When this fellow arrives,
it would be nice if you could leave
Edith and me to see him on our own.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.316
This must be it. Ah.

06:41.526 --> 06:44.403
Really, Milady? You do surprise me.

06:46.405 --> 06:50.076
I hope your standards are
not so high as to prevent you

06:50.117 --> 06:52.745
remaining in my employment, Denker.

06:52.787 --> 06:55.832
No, not at all.
Not as high as that, Milady.

06:57.124 --> 06:59.168
Where's the...?

06:59.210 --> 07:01.295
Where's the knocker?

07:02.588 --> 07:04.674
(LOUD THUD, THEN DOG BARKS)

07:06.884 --> 07:08.970
You... You stay here.

07:24.443 --> 07:26.612
I've shown him
into the drawing room,

07:26.654 --> 07:29.615
but I'm afraid it is as we feared.

07:29.657 --> 07:32.869
- Oh, I am sorry.
- His Lordship's with them now.

07:32.910 --> 07:36.873
- He's here, then?
- Yes, and it's not looking hopeful.

07:36.914 --> 07:41.043
Oh, dear. Mrs Hughes says
you want to come with us tomorrow.

07:41.085 --> 07:45.298
- Only if you wouldn't mind.
- This is the olive branch, I suppose?

07:45.339 --> 07:48.551
- If it's too much trouble -
- No, no.

07:48.593 --> 07:50.720
You can buy the tea.

07:55.016 --> 07:57.727
Mr Carson wants to see the cottage.

07:57.768 --> 07:59.979
He wants you to forgive him.

08:00.021 --> 08:02.481
- Why don't you come too?
- I've got work to do.

08:02.523 --> 08:06.068
You seem to be working harder
than when Miss Bunting was around.

08:06.110 --> 08:08.905
I am.
I'm determined not to let her down.

08:11.282 --> 08:15.745
(RUSSIAN ACCENT)
Some tea? I can just about make tea.

08:19.290 --> 08:23.377
- How did you find me?
- Rose gave me your address.

08:23.419 --> 08:26.088
And you came alone
to this part of the city?

08:26.130 --> 08:30.259
I was accompanied by my maid.
She's waiting outside.

08:30.301 --> 08:33.179
How wonderful to be back in a world

08:33.221 --> 08:36.349
where ladies are
accompanied by their maids.

08:39.977 --> 08:42.605
Why didn't your son provide you
with a car?

08:42.647 --> 08:47.777
Oh, he would have done. I just didn't
choose to tell him where I was going.

08:49.362 --> 08:52.031
It is not our first
secret assignation.

08:54.742 --> 08:59.664
I always feel more comfortable...
leaving the past in the past.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.417
Then why have you come?

09:03.459 --> 09:06.879
Because Rose's father,
Lord Flintshire,

09:06.921 --> 09:09.757
thinks he's close
to finding the Princess.

09:12.593 --> 09:16.597
- She's alive, then? - She was alive
when she left Russia. That they know.

09:17.640 --> 09:20.977
They think she was put on a boat
headed for Hong Kong.

09:21.018 --> 09:23.104
You'll know more soon.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.524
(SIGHS)

09:32.363 --> 09:38.494
(SIGHS) I wanted you
from the moment I first saw you.

09:39.537 --> 09:42.456
More than mortal man
ever wanted woman.

09:42.498 --> 09:44.584
That is an historical detail.

09:45.543 --> 09:47.628
Nonsense.

09:48.337 --> 09:52.258
If Irena were dead, I would ask you
to run away with me now.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.385
You couldn't run away

09:54.427 --> 09:56.971
when there's no-one left
to "run away" from.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.350
I loved you more than I loved her.

10:03.352 --> 10:05.438
Even today.

10:05.479 --> 10:07.565
Even this afternoon.

10:08.733 --> 10:11.235
- Please don't.
- Why not,

10:11.277 --> 10:13.362
if it's true?

10:13.404 --> 10:16.574
Because you'll make it sound as if
we were both unhappy,

10:17.658 --> 10:20.953
and I don't believe you were -
and I certainly was not.

10:20.995 --> 10:23.414
You wouldn't admit it
if it were true.

10:25.500 --> 10:31.297
You think to be unhappy
in a marriage... is ill-bred.

10:34.509 --> 10:36.594
You do know me, Igor.

10:37.845 --> 10:39.931
That I must concede.

10:42.850 --> 10:44.936
Yes.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.567
- Who was that?
- Sergeant Willis.

10:54.862 --> 10:58.407
He wants to come back with that man
from Scotland Yard.

10:58.449 --> 11:01.661
- I don't like the sound of it.
- Is it to see Mr Bates again?

11:01.702 --> 11:03.704
That's the funny thing.

11:03.746 --> 11:06.624
- He wants to see Miss Baxter
this time. - Miss Baxter?

11:06.666 --> 11:09.502
- What's she got to say about it?
- Search me.

11:09.544 --> 11:13.381
- When are they coming?
- Tomorrow morning.

11:13.422 --> 11:16.968
I hope they don't stay all day -
or we'll miss our appointment.

11:23.099 --> 11:25.226
- He's gone.
- Didn't he want some tea?

11:25.268 --> 11:29.647
I offered him tea, dinner and a bed
for the night, but he had to get
back.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.275
- Gregson's dead, I'm afraid.
- (SIGHS)

11:34.277 --> 11:36.863
How terrible that is to hear.

11:36.904 --> 11:39.240
And was it this Herr Hitler?

11:39.282 --> 11:43.119
Apparently.
Or at least his gang of thugs,

11:43.160 --> 11:46.372
during the so-called
Bierkeller Putsch in Munich.

11:46.414 --> 11:49.876
It took days for the police to get
the city back under control,

11:49.917 --> 11:52.378
and by then any trace of Gregson
was buried.

11:52.420 --> 11:55.464
They've found him now, of course -
or what's left of him.

11:55.506 --> 11:58.134
It's too horrible to think about.

11:58.176 --> 12:01.387
At least they've locked Hitler up
for five long years.

12:01.429 --> 12:04.807
Coombs says he won't serve
five years, or anything like it.

12:06.642 --> 12:09.103
There's another thing.

12:09.145 --> 12:13.566
- Edith inherits Gregson's publishing
company. - I think I expected that.

12:13.608 --> 12:16.319
I hope, somehow, it helps her
get through this.

12:16.360 --> 12:20.281
- It was very generous of him.
- I suppose they loved each other.

12:20.323 --> 12:22.742
Oh, poor Edith.
How is she taking it?

12:22.783 --> 12:26.579
Hard to say.
It wasn't a surprise, of course.

12:26.621 --> 12:30.625
- But there's always a shred of hope,
isn't there? - Shall I go and see her?

12:30.666 --> 12:32.752
She's gone for a walk.

12:33.669 --> 12:35.755
She wanted to be on her own.

12:45.890 --> 12:49.393
I'm sorry, Milady, I'm afraid
it's not convenient just now.

12:49.435 --> 12:52.688
- I-I only want a moment.
- As I said, it's not convenient.

12:52.730 --> 12:55.107
- What's this?
- I don't want her to come in.

12:55.149 --> 12:58.069
- Well, there's no need to be rude.
- Of course not.

12:58.110 --> 13:00.613
Well, she's not coming in -
and that's flat.

13:04.575 --> 13:08.454
I'm trying to bring her around, but
I wish you hadn't jumped the gun.

13:08.496 --> 13:12.792
I know, but I had some bad news today
and I needed to see her.

13:12.834 --> 13:15.670
You mean you were right about
Marigold's father?

13:18.172 --> 13:20.258
I'm very sorry to hear it.

13:20.299 --> 13:24.303
- But if you could just give me some
time. - I don't have time, Mr Drewe.

13:26.806 --> 13:30.768
Of course I'm sorry, but let's face
it - he's been dead for over a year.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.812
That's when he went missing.

13:32.854 --> 13:36.315
Yes, but he didn't die for
Lady Edith until this afternoon.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.985
- That's what matters, isn't it?
- I suppose so.

13:39.026 --> 13:43.322
- What are you studying now, Daisy?
- The War of the Spanish Succession.

13:43.364 --> 13:45.449
Oh. As a matter of fact, I'm ve...

13:48.411 --> 13:50.496
Very what, Mr Molesley?

13:52.206 --> 13:54.292
Er... Oh, never mind.

13:58.921 --> 14:02.633
- Ohh... I'm sorry to disturb
Your Ladyship. - What is it, Spratt?

14:02.675 --> 14:06.262
We are having rather a problem
with Miss Denker.

14:06.304 --> 14:09.682
She does not seem to grasp
the laundry arrangements here.

14:09.724 --> 14:14.353
She wants it all to go to the big
house, even the... smaller items.

14:14.395 --> 14:17.523
You're losing your sense of
the appropriate, Spratt.

14:17.565 --> 14:19.775
You're losing your sense of occasion.

14:19.817 --> 14:22.320
But she's back there
in the kitchen now,

14:22.361 --> 14:26.240
shouting at the top of her voice,
and refusing to wash your... things.

14:26.282 --> 14:30.536
Well, I'm sure this is
all very interesting to Mrs Crawley.

14:30.578 --> 14:33.748
I'm sorry, Milady, but I can't
help it. May I send her in?

14:36.834 --> 14:40.171
- I do apologise. - Oh, don't.
I'm enjoying it immensely.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.340
Oh, that's what I was afraid of.

14:42.381 --> 14:46.802
- Are you going to the picnic at
Canningford Grange on Saturday?
- I think I might.

14:46.844 --> 14:50.348
Oh, I'm glad, because...
No, never mind.

14:50.389 --> 14:52.475
What were you going to say?

14:52.517 --> 14:55.353
Only that I've asked
Lord Merton to tea tomorrow.

14:56.437 --> 14:58.856
Have you decided at last?

14:58.898 --> 15:02.109
- Yes, I think so. - Oh.
- But please don't pester me.

15:02.151 --> 15:05.530
- I'll let you know on Saturday.
- (DOOR OPENS) Oh.

15:05.571 --> 15:09.158
I'm having rather a problem
with Mr Spratt, Milady.

15:09.200 --> 15:12.245
I do not know if Miss Collins
pandered to him,

15:12.286 --> 15:16.415
but he seems to have no knowledge of
the proper role of a lady's maid.

15:16.457 --> 15:20.503
Well, we all pander to Spratt
in this house, Denker.

15:20.545 --> 15:24.632
- He rules us with a rod of iron.
- All except me, Milady.

15:24.674 --> 15:28.803
But I see you have company, so we'll
discuss this at some other time.

15:30.972 --> 15:34.225
And you wonder why I have
neither lady's maid nor butler.

(CROCKERY CLATTERS)

15:39.188 --> 15:41.983
When I've done these,
I might go back to the cottage

15:42.024 --> 15:44.110
and read until our dinner.

15:44.151 --> 15:47.613
Madge says Lady Edith is
dreadfully cut up,

15:47.655 --> 15:51.075
and it's extra hard because
he was killed so long ago.

15:51.117 --> 15:55.079
And I suppose she can't expect the
whole household to go into mourning

15:55.121 --> 15:58.166
when he was no relation
and he's been dead for so long.

16:02.378 --> 16:04.922
Will you please tell me
what is the matter?

16:04.964 --> 16:09.177
- I couldn't find your button box.
- I'd forgotten all about it.

16:09.218 --> 16:12.263
- Oh, well, never mind.
It'll turn up. - I did look.

16:12.305 --> 16:15.224
- I'm sure you did.
- I looked in all the cupboards,

16:15.266 --> 16:18.394
- and I found some other things.
- Oh, yes? - Yes.

16:19.353 --> 16:21.439
I found a book by Marie Stopes

16:22.899 --> 16:26.986
and a box containing
a cunning piece of equipment

16:27.028 --> 16:30.489
to ensure there would be
no Baby Bates.

16:30.531 --> 16:34.202
And I'm supposed to applaud your
poking around in my things, am I?

16:34.243 --> 16:37.246
Now, just a minute. It is not for
you to be angry with me -

16:37.288 --> 16:40.333
- it is for me to be angry with you.
- How do you make that out?

16:40.374 --> 16:43.419
You tell me
you are longing for a child,

16:43.461 --> 16:46.422
that it's in the hands of God,
but you seem to have

16:46.464 --> 16:50.343
put it in the very practised hands
of Miss Stopes.

16:50.384 --> 16:53.513
- You're wrong. It's not like that.
- Then what is it like?

16:53.554 --> 16:55.681

- Come in, Lily.

16:55.723 --> 16:57.850

Ah, Daisy, there you are. I wondered
if you'd like to borrow this.

The Cambridge Modern History.

17:06.817 --> 17:09.487
My dad gave me the whole set
for my 40th birthday.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.989
I don't know.
I've got so many books already.

17:12.031 --> 17:15.034
Don't be churlish.
Mr Molesley's offering to lend you

17:15.076 --> 17:16.993
one of his prized possessions.

17:17.036 --> 17:20.998
There's a good chapter on the war
and politics in Queen Anne's reign.

17:21.040 --> 17:24.167
But if it's not interesting to you,
I quite understand.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.295
No, I will look at it. Thank you.

17:30.466 --> 17:34.095
He's very kind, you know.
We should always be polite

17:34.136 --> 17:37.098
to people who are kind.
There's not much of it about.

17:42.353 --> 17:44.772
- What have you told Bates?
- Nothing.

17:44.814 --> 17:48.734
- And he hasn't asked why you're
sleeping in here? - Certainly not.

17:48.776 --> 17:52.321
I wondered if you might like to
change your mind and come back.

17:55.867 --> 17:59.662
You heard Mr Bricker say he was
not in my room by my invitation.

17:59.704 --> 18:02.456
How do I know that wasn't
just his gallantry?

18:02.498 --> 18:05.710
Because I'm telling you.
Nothing happened.

18:06.752 --> 18:10.840
I'll tell you what did happen. You
allowed him into your private life.

18:10.882 --> 18:14.343
A man who thought he could
step into my place, just like that.

18:14.385 --> 18:17.805
He thought it - and he was mistaken.

18:23.394 --> 18:27.231
Very well. If you can honestly say
you have never let a flirtation

18:27.273 --> 18:30.985
get out of hand since we married,
if you have never given a woman

18:31.027 --> 18:33.946
the wrong impression,
then by all means stay away.

18:33.988 --> 18:36.699
Otherwise, I expect you
back in my room tonight.

What have I got to do with it?

18:58.846 --> 19:01.432
I wasn't working here
when Mr Green first came.

19:01.474 --> 19:04.435
- That's right. She only came -
- Thank you, Mrs Hughes.

19:04.477 --> 19:07.271
Even so, we understand
you have some information

19:07.313 --> 19:10.149
- concerning Mr and Mrs Bates.
- What information?

19:10.191 --> 19:12.193
That's what we hope you'll tell us.

19:12.235 --> 19:15.780
I want to talk about your past.
Would you prefer we were alone?

19:15.821 --> 19:18.866
I can't allow you
to question a maid in this house

19:18.908 --> 19:21.202

- Miss Baxter?

19:22.119 --> 19:24.163
- Let her stay.
- Very well.

19:24.205 --> 19:27.250
- When you served your prison
sentence for theft - - What?

19:27.291 --> 19:29.377
They released you after three years,

19:29.418 --> 19:32.547
- leaving the remaining two years
to lie on the books. - Yes.

19:32.588 --> 19:35.174
You know that if you break the terms
of your release,

19:35.216 --> 19:38.177
- you can return to prison
without a trial? - That seems -

19:38.219 --> 19:42.598
Mrs Hughes, one more interruption
and I will ask you to leave.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.809
You think I know more than I do.

19:44.851 --> 19:49.397
I believe there was an incident
when Mr Green was staying here.

19:49.438 --> 19:53.109
And there may have been a journey
to London that no-one knew about,

19:53.150 --> 19:55.820
but I couldn't swear to any of it.

19:55.862 --> 19:59.323
Not even whether it was
Mr Bates who made the journey?

19:59.365 --> 20:01.909
Not even that.

20:01.951 --> 20:04.704
Thanks for your help, Miss Baxter.

20:05.621 --> 20:08.541

- We had a letter.
- From whom?

20:15.631 --> 20:18.551
I am going to ask one question.

20:22.013 --> 20:24.390
Does Her Ladyship know your story?

20:24.432 --> 20:27.226
Yes, she knows everything.

20:29.478 --> 20:31.564
Then we'll say no more about it.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.530
- Come and see these.
- Oh, yes,

20:39.572 --> 20:42.909
this is just the kind of work
we're looking for, isn't it?

20:42.950 --> 20:45.786
- I knew you'd say that.
- Why? - They'd cost the most.

20:45.828 --> 20:49.165
- And these designs? - They'd be
much cheaper. - Much nastier.

20:49.207 --> 20:53.127
A lot of the renovated cottages will
be occupied by lifetime tenants.

houses, we'll make our own?
- Tom's protecting the estate.

What's the matter, darling?
She's very listless.

21:03.137 --> 21:05.097
I wonder if she's picked up a germ?

21:05.139 --> 21:08.434
She'd have eaten a dead squirrel
or something equally fell.

21:08.476 --> 21:11.854
- She's quite fat. Perhaps she's
pregnant. - No, she can't be.

21:11.896 --> 21:14.315
So, what do we say about
these drawings?

21:14.357 --> 21:18.152

cheaper option, but it's a shame.

You've had a look at the things
he brought, then?

You've been injecting yourself
with a solution of saline.

24:05.444 --> 24:09.740
- That's not harmful, though, is it?
- It obviously wasn't sterilised.

24:09.782 --> 24:14.287
Repeated injections would cause
fever, and abscesses at the site.

treatment you've spent money on?

24:17.874 --> 24:19.959
Yes, a lot of money.

I went to London
for what they call electrotherapy.

supposed to continue the process.

24:28.259 --> 24:30.344

24:35.850 --> 24:38.060
To change me.

24:38.978 --> 24:41.063
To make me more like other people.

Well, I'll not be coy and pretend I
don't understand. Nor do I blame you.

And to fashion as good a life
as you are able.

always better than false hope.

to be a very brave person.

To inflict such pain on yourself

could do in this world

28:13.860 --> 28:16.654
Hopefully not,
as you usually spoil everything.

28:16.696 --> 28:19.782
Huh. Yes, I do.

28:19.824 --> 28:22.535
It seems I do.

28:22.577 --> 28:25.121
Goodnight, Mama.
I'll have a tray in my room.

28:26.038 --> 28:29.834
I'm sorry, Mr Aldridge, but you
might as well know what we're like.

28:30.668 --> 28:31.878
(SIGHS)

28:33.379 --> 28:37.800
- Poor darling. She's so unhappy. - She
hasn't clapped eyes on him in years.

28:37.842 --> 28:40.803
She must have known long ago
he was dead - we all did.

28:40.845 --> 28:44.140
- But should we go on Saturday?
- Please don't cancel.

28:44.182 --> 28:47.101
Rose and I are going,
whether you're coming or not.

28:47.143 --> 28:50.396
Maybe it would be good for her to
have time on her own to think.

28:50.438 --> 28:54.066
All this endless thinking.
It's very overrated.

28:54.108 --> 28:56.194
Oh, Aunt Violet, I do love you.

28:56.235 --> 29:02.366
I blame the war. Before 1914, nobody
thought about anything at all.

29:04.577 --> 29:06.746
(METALLIC SQUEAK)

29:06.787 --> 29:09.123
But what would I want
with such a thing?

29:09.165 --> 29:11.542
I'll tell you.

29:11.584 --> 29:14.795
It's quite simple.
To avoid bearing my child.

29:14.837 --> 29:18.966
How can you believe that...
when it's all I've ever dreamed of?

29:19.008 --> 29:21.093
Because you think I'm a murderer.

29:29.810 --> 29:31.896
(VOICE BREAKS) What are you saying?

29:34.398 --> 29:36.526
- We know how Vera died.
- Not Vera.

29:36.567 --> 29:38.653
But...

29:40.571 --> 29:42.657
.. Mr Green.

29:51.249 --> 29:53.125
How long have you known it was him?

29:53.167 --> 29:56.337
I've known since the first day
I heard that it happened.

29:57.547 --> 30:00.800
You can't have. You may have
suspected, but you didn't know.

30:00.842 --> 30:03.261
I knew when he came back.
I knew when he said

30:03.302 --> 30:06.222
he went down to the kitchens
during the concerts.

30:06.264 --> 30:08.766
(SNIFFS)

30:08.808 --> 30:13.229
And I kept telling myself you didn't
know, so it couldn't have been you.

30:15.064 --> 30:17.400
Who killed him, you mean?

30:21.529 --> 30:23.614
I wanted to.

30:26.742 --> 30:28.828
I was going to.

30:30.496 --> 30:35.001
I went into York very early, and
I bought a return ticket to London.

30:35.042 --> 30:38.129
I planned to get there and back
in the same day.

30:38.171 --> 30:42.508
I went onto the platform,
but I never got onto the train.

30:45.469 --> 30:47.555
(Why not?)

30:47.597 --> 30:49.682
Because I knew...

30:50.600 --> 30:53.895
.. if I saw him,
I would have killed him.

30:55.813 --> 30:58.649
And if I killed him,...
I would hang.

30:59.650 --> 31:01.736
- I couldn't do that to you.
- (EXHALES)

31:03.196 --> 31:04.655
Thank God.

31:04.697 --> 31:08.409
The next day, when I heard what had
happened, it was like...

31:08.451 --> 31:10.536
the hand of fate.

31:11.579 --> 31:15.333
I had the ticket in my coat pocket,

31:15.374 --> 31:17.627
- like a talisman.
- What for?

31:17.668 --> 31:20.213
Because if I'd have travelled,
I'd...

31:20.254 --> 31:24.175
I would've handed in both halves.
The fact that it was in my pocket,

31:24.217 --> 31:27.553
untorn, was proof
that I never travelled.

31:27.595 --> 31:30.848
Which is why you were so angry
when I gave it to Mrs Hughes.

31:35.228 --> 31:37.563
If the clerk in York
remembers selling me

31:37.605 --> 31:39.690
a return ticket to London,

31:41.442 --> 31:43.528
I'm a dead man.

31:45.112 --> 31:47.198
Why are you smiling?

31:47.240 --> 31:49.742
Because you're innocent.

31:50.576 --> 31:52.662
I have lived in such fear...

31:53.704 --> 31:55.790
.. and such trembling,

31:56.791 --> 31:59.126
and all the while
I couldn't tell you why.

32:00.586 --> 32:02.672
And now I'm just so happy.

32:04.382 --> 32:07.552
Mad as it sounds, I'm so happy.

32:21.774 --> 32:23.860
What do you make of Lady Mary's hair?

32:24.735 --> 32:28.322
They were all talking about it.
I hope she comes down to show us.

32:28.364 --> 32:30.658
Miss Bunting
loved the new hairstyles.

32:32.201 --> 32:34.537
She said women were being set free.

32:34.579 --> 32:36.914
I'm sorry Miss Bunting's gone.

32:36.956 --> 32:41.210
She gave me such confidence.
She'd tell me how sharp I was,

32:41.252 --> 32:43.421
- how quick.
- I agree with her.

32:43.462 --> 32:47.508
It's harder on your own,
harder to believe.

32:47.550 --> 32:49.927
Well, could I help?

32:50.720 --> 32:54.724
Not with mathematics, probably,
but I know a bit about history

32:54.765 --> 32:59.562
- and I've read a few books. - How old
were you when you left school? - 12.

32:59.604 --> 33:02.064
It was a shame, really.
I was quite bright.

33:02.106 --> 33:04.192
And my dad wanted me to stay on.

33:05.318 --> 33:08.946
He thought I could be a teacher,
if that doesn't make you laugh.

33:08.988 --> 33:11.824
But he couldn't manage it.
We had no money, you see,

33:11.866 --> 33:15.912
and then my mother got ill and
so I had to earn as soon as I could.

33:15.953 --> 33:18.039
Why don't you take Matric now?

33:18.080 --> 33:20.708
No, I've missed it.

33:20.750 --> 33:23.544
But I'd like to help.

33:23.586 --> 33:25.671
Make sure somebody got away.

33:31.677 --> 33:33.262
Mrs Hughes?

33:33.304 --> 33:37.099
Do you remember that overcoat
I gave you, for the refugees,

33:37.141 --> 33:39.894
when we were in London
for Lady Rose's ball?

33:39.936 --> 33:42.438
I do. They were very glad of it.

33:42.480 --> 33:46.526
It sounds mad, I know,
but did you find a ticket in it,

33:46.567 --> 33:48.694
in the pocket?

33:49.946 --> 33:53.324
- Of course. You won't remember.
- No, I do.

33:53.366 --> 33:56.869
I did find one, a return to London.

33:56.911 --> 33:58.996
That's it.

33:59.038 --> 34:01.123
Come...

34:02.750 --> 34:04.836
You see,

34:04.877 --> 34:09.924
- Mr Bates does know
that it was Mr Green. - Oh, my Lord!

34:09.966 --> 34:12.760
But he didn't do it, Mrs Hughes.
I know that now.

34:12.802 --> 34:15.221
And if we had that ticket
we could prove it.

34:15.263 --> 34:19.475
- We could prove that he never went to
London. - I don't understand. How?

34:19.516 --> 34:21.601
Because it wasn't torn.

34:23.312 --> 34:27.525
Of course, you threw it out.
Why wouldn't you?

34:27.567 --> 34:30.652
I must have done. I'm so sorry.

34:30.695 --> 34:33.947
It's not your fault. It's mine.

34:35.699 --> 34:38.327
I gave it away.

34:38.369 --> 34:41.121
I gave away the proof of
my husband's innocence.

Brave? I'm petrified. I don't even
know the horse I'm riding.

- Three miles.

- Where are you staying? - Last night
I was with the Lawsons at Brough,

36:02.954 --> 36:05.915
but they're away tonight
so I'll head back to London.

36:05.957 --> 36:07.834
What a trek. You'll be exhausted.

and Mr Blake will be there.

night. His nice parents let me
change at the house.

- I do wish you'd call me Atticus.
- I admire you.

36:28.187 --> 36:31.524
- It'd be a poor show not to ride at
our own event. - Quite right.

36:31.566 --> 36:35.361
- I shall cheer you on. - What about
you? When did you decide to ride?

36:35.403 --> 36:39.198
- Yesterday, when I was having my hair
done in York. - What about a horse?

a coincidence. Are you stalking me?

I shall ignore that as I'd
hate to think of you as a vain man.

Well, you certainly know
how to surprise.

No, I've a lot to do. To be honest,
it's not really my thing.

- Are you going out again? - No.
I've a new tenancy contract to check,

- No, well, I haven't told anybody.

37:39.050 --> 37:41.344
I don't understand.

37:41.385 --> 37:46.599
You don't have to, but when they get
back, tell them my mind was made up

37:46.641 --> 37:48.768
and I wasn't hysterical or anything.

37:49.602 --> 37:52.647
- And give them my love.

but you can't
let her get away with it!

38:53.166 --> 38:55.334
I have a copy of
her birth certificate.

38:55.376 --> 38:59.046
- It's in French, but you can read
my name. - Which was brave of you.

38:59.088 --> 39:03.509
- My aunt wanted me to use a false
one, but I knew I might need proof.
- Give that to me!

- I have others. - You've cooked this up

which to break. - Don't be spiky,

- when I only want what you want.
- Which is?

- For you and Tony to walk into the
sunset together. - I do resent you.

I resent your ability to take him
off me, when I know how to make him

41:32.700 --> 41:36.287
- happy, and I certainly love him more
than you do. - That's all true.

- Yes.

Huh. Well, now you've accepted him,
you'll hear no more argument from me.

42:48.317 --> 42:50.403
(WHINNYING AND SNORTING)

42:57.160 --> 42:59.245
(EXCITED CHATTER)

43:15.219 --> 43:18.181
- (WILD CHEERING)
- Go on!

43:18.890 --> 43:20.975
Go, Atticus, go!

43:24.854 --> 43:26.939
(HOOVES THUNDER)

43:31.777 --> 43:33.863
Come on, faster!

43:52.215 --> 43:54.300
Tony! (GIGGLES)

44:02.975 --> 44:05.061
(ALL SHOUTING ENCOURAGEMENT)

44:17.782 --> 44:21.160
- You might have allowed her to be
the first woman. - Nonsense.

44:21.202 --> 44:23.412
I don't believe in
letting people win.

44:23.454 --> 44:26.749
- Even if it's in your own interest?
- Mm-hm. - You rode well.

44:26.791 --> 44:31.921
- If I make it across the finishing
line at all it's a miracle, as far
as I'm concerned. - Nonsense.

44:31.963 --> 44:34.131
You're a positive centaur.

44:34.173 --> 44:38.135
See? He's nearly there - if you'd
just stop jerking his lead.

44:38.177 --> 44:43.057
Well done, but thank God you're all
back in one piece. Who's this?

44:43.099 --> 44:48.187
My parents. Mother, Father, this is
Lord and Lady Grantham. Lady Mary
you already know.

44:48.229 --> 44:52.525
Lord Gillingham, Mabel Lane Fox,
Charles Blake and, of course, Rose.

44:52.567 --> 44:55.111
Lady Rose,
how lovely to see you again.

44:55.153 --> 44:57.572
Come back to the house to bathe
and change.

44:57.613 --> 45:00.992
I'm going to leave it until we get
back to Downton, but thank you.

45:01.033 --> 45:03.077
I can't tempt you
to stay for dinner?

45:03.119 --> 45:05.037
Not today. We're covered in dust.

45:05.079 --> 45:09.125
- Come to Downton tomorrow for dinner.
- That seems rather an imposition.

45:09.167 --> 45:11.836
- Not at all.
- Then we'd be delighted.

45:11.878 --> 45:17.049
- You haven't met my mother-in-law
and our cousin, Mrs Crawley.
- Good afternoon.

45:17.091 --> 45:20.428
If the parents of Rose's young man
are coming for dinner,

45:20.469 --> 45:23.806
things must be
more advanced than I realised.

45:23.848 --> 45:27.685
He seems a nice boy, and it's not
like the Catholics, is it?

45:27.727 --> 45:29.979
She won't be expected to convert.

45:30.021 --> 45:33.149
- Con... Convert to what?
- Judaism.

45:33.191 --> 45:35.276
I read in an article, Lord Sinderby

45:35.318 --> 45:37.904
is a leading figure
in the Jewish community.

45:37.945 --> 45:42.116
(SIGHS) There's always something,
isn't there?

45:46.204 --> 45:48.915
- What do you mean, gone?
- She's gone.

45:48.956 --> 45:53.169
- She didn't say where, but I doubt
it's to Lady Rosamund's. - Why?

45:53.211 --> 45:56.589
Of course she was very upset about
Gregson, but why run off?

45:59.050 --> 46:02.512
I think I'll slip away, Carson.
Is the car still outside?

46:02.553 --> 46:06.057
- They're just unloading it now,
My Lady. I'll - - You stay here.

46:06.098 --> 46:07.975
I can manage.

46:08.017 --> 46:10.478
- Could you take those two down?
- Yes.

46:10.520 --> 46:14.190
- Whose cases are these? - Lady Mary's.
They're her riding things.

46:15.858 --> 46:19.028
These are Miss Lane Fox's.
If you could take them in.

46:19.779 --> 46:23.783
Home, please. Can you
first stop at Yew Tree Farm?

46:23.825 --> 46:25.368
Yes, Milady.

46:25.409 --> 46:27.495
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

46:29.288 --> 46:33.251
- Lady Edith has taken off.
- What do you mean? - She's gone.

46:33.292 --> 46:35.127
She left her car at the station.

46:35.169 --> 46:37.964
Mr Branson's walking down there now
to pick it up.

46:38.005 --> 46:40.758
Oh, it must have been
the news from Germany. Tsk.

46:40.800 --> 46:44.303
- Poor thing. - Well, I ought to
go and ring the gong.

46:44.345 --> 46:46.430
Hm.

46:48.933 --> 46:50.977
(CLEARS THROAT) Mrs Hughes,

46:51.018 --> 46:55.273
may I make a suggestion that I think
you'll find a strange one,

46:55.314 --> 46:57.692
but I ask that you consider,
none the less.

46:57.733 --> 47:00.153
Heavens. I'm all agog.

47:00.194 --> 47:02.280
Do you think that we should... um...

47:03.948 --> 47:05.700
(CLEARS THROAT)

47:05.741 --> 47:07.827
.. invest in a property together?

47:08.703 --> 47:10.788
What on earth do you mean?

47:10.830 --> 47:15.543
I was thinking, if Mrs Patmore
can do it, then we might buy

47:15.585 --> 47:18.713
somewhere jointly,
as a business venture, mind,

47:18.754 --> 47:21.716
spruce it up
and share the rental income.

47:21.757 --> 47:24.177
We'd have a tidy sum
by the time we retired.

47:26.137 --> 47:28.222
Go and ring that gong.

47:36.397 --> 47:38.483
Well, so the birds have flown?

47:38.524 --> 47:42.069
I won't say anything about it,
Your Ladyship. Not to anyone.

47:44.989 --> 47:47.074
Nor will she.

47:47.116 --> 47:49.202
Do you know where she's gone?

47:50.536 --> 47:52.622
No.

47:52.663 --> 47:57.668
(SIGHS) Well, thank you so much,
Mr Drewe, Mrs Drewe.

47:57.710 --> 48:01.297
I mustn't take up
any more of your valuable time.

48:20.733 --> 48:23.319
They'll bring a cot for
the young 'un, madam.

48:23.361 --> 48:26.989
- Ring down if there's anything else.
- I will do. Thank you.

48:29.116 --> 48:31.244
Oh.

48:31.285 --> 48:33.371
Thank you.

48:35.289 --> 48:38.334
(SIGHS) Well, we're together,
darling.

48:39.836 --> 48:44.924
I know it's not ideal, but it's such
an improvement on being apart

48:44.966 --> 48:47.635
that I think we should celebrate.

48:47.677 --> 48:51.305
I'll order ice cream,
and a glass of Champagne,

48:52.390 --> 48:54.475
and we'll be as jolly as you like.

48:56.018 --> 48:58.104
Yes?
