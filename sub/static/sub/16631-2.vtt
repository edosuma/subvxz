WEBVTT

00:05.390 --> 00:06.778
- That's a movie star?

00:06.830 --> 00:09.867
- Just a rich girl
on a field trip.

00:09.920 --> 00:12.354
- The girls that work
the factory floor make

00:12.400 --> 00:13.526
something that matters.

00:13.570 --> 00:15.094
- You're gonna burn, Sister!

00:15.140 --> 00:16.960
- Whatever you're
running from,

00:17.010 --> 00:18.398
you're safe here now.

00:18.450 --> 00:20.224
- An Italian building
Allied bombs?

00:20.280 --> 00:23.534
I say 2 words about this,
you're gone.

00:23.580 --> 00:25.309
[Screaming]

00:25.370 --> 00:27.361
You can't let her
leave here deformed.

00:27.410 --> 00:28.889
- You're not
working the floor.

00:28.940 --> 00:31.329
You're in the office.
- I wanna do more.

00:31.370 --> 00:33.065
- [James]:
They don't need you.

00:33.120 --> 00:35.463
Mischievous moon...

00:35.510 --> 00:37.375
- [Man 1]: OK!

00:37.420 --> 00:39.115
- [Man 2]:
Fire in the hole!

00:39.160 --> 00:42.516
Sometimes I wonder...

00:42.560 --> 00:44.516
- [Archie]:
I love a sunny test day.

00:47.350 --> 00:49.693
- Good, yeah.
- Very nice!

00:51.390 --> 00:53.950
- Carol, what are
you doing here?

00:54.010 --> 00:56.524
- Gladys, your parents
will never let you

00:56.570 --> 00:58.003
work the factory floor.

00:58.050 --> 00:59.654
- You're absolutely
right, Carol.

00:59.710 --> 01:01.666
That's why I'm never
going to tell them.

01:01.710 --> 01:04.099
If James won't
tell them, who will?

01:04.150 --> 01:06.493
Unless you spill the
beans at dinner tonight.

01:06.540 --> 01:08.622
- What do I say if
they ask about work?

01:08.670 --> 01:10.490
- They won't.
They don't care what I do.

01:10.540 --> 01:12.496
We're just there to
make evens with James

01:12.550 --> 01:13.801
and his Harvard chum.

01:13.850 --> 01:15.932
They're trying to get
into business with him.

01:15.980 --> 01:18.119
- Well, ifI crack
like a cooked clam,

01:18.160 --> 01:19.331
don't blame me.

01:19.380 --> 01:21.689
- Don't be such a girl.
Hand me my turban.

01:21.730 --> 01:25.200
Like musical notes
from the bars

01:25.250 --> 01:30.085
Of an old familiar tune...

01:35.440 --> 01:37.954
- Now, this may hurt.

01:38.010 --> 01:39.910
- No. I can't feel
anything up there.

01:39.960 --> 01:41.131
Is that normal?

01:41.180 --> 01:43.705
- Well, your nerves
are still recovering.

01:43.750 --> 01:46.480
You'll start to feel things
in a couple of weeks.

01:48.890 --> 01:50.619
- I get the picture, doc.

01:52.670 --> 01:54.194
- [Lorna]:
I nearly forgot.

01:54.240 --> 01:57.585
- Oh, yes! The girls at
the factory chipped in.

01:57.630 --> 02:00.246
You know, Vera,
they'd love a visit.

02:00.290 --> 02:01.848
- Well, I wouldn't.

02:01.900 --> 02:04.152
- It's a Veronica Lake.
It's perfect for you.

02:04.210 --> 02:06.110
-_ We can't have her
In a Wig yet, mom.

02:06.160 --> 02:07.684
It would pinch
something fierce.

02:07.730 --> 02:12.121
- Not on me.
I can't feel a thing.

02:14.780 --> 02:17.032
- I know I should be
sad for her and all,

02:17.090 --> 02:19.217
but maybe now she'll
get off her high horse

02:19.260 --> 02:20.739
and let me take her out.

02:20.790 --> 02:22.826
- Vera may have
lost half her face,

02:22.880 --> 02:24.177
but she didn't go blind.

02:24.230 --> 02:26.869
- Knock it off.
What happened is no joke.

02:26.920 --> 02:28.262
[Explosion]

02:28.320 --> 02:30.925
- OK, girls,
let's have a look at you.

02:30.970 --> 02:33.188
[Women giggling]

02:34.670 --> 02:36.797
- Miss Andrews,
you've got enough lipstick on

02:36.850 --> 02:38.192
to paint a battleship.

02:38.240 --> 02:40.322
- I didn't know makeup
was a safety hazard.

02:40.370 --> 02:41.928
- You spark a fire
in the gents

02:41.980 --> 02:44.585
and they could end up
distracted and endanger us.

02:44.640 --> 02:46.676
- [Lorna]:
It's OK, Edith.

02:48.250 --> 02:50.241
Looking good McRae.

02:50.300 --> 02:53.110
- Next up are
Blue Shift's 25-pounders.

02:53.170 --> 02:55.206
- Artillery's magic bullet!

02:55.260 --> 02:57.603
Blows the Jerry tanks sky-high!

02:57.650 --> 02:58.992
[All laughing]

03:01.570 --> 03:04.130
- Fix your laces
there, Darcy.

03:04.180 --> 03:06.432
- Ready for my shift,
Mrs. Corbett.

03:06.490 --> 03:08.708
- With this flapping
thicket of hair?

03:08.750 --> 03:11.355
You wanna see a conveyor belt
snap your neck off,

03:11.400 --> 03:13.129
do it on your own time.

03:13.190 --> 03:15.795
We don't have time to mop up
bloody bits of rich girl.

03:15.840 --> 03:18.400
- It's just it's not easy
if we can't use hairpins.

03:18.450 --> 03:21.408
- You think the rules
don't apply to you?

03:21.460 --> 03:24.020
- I'm the same as
any other woman here.

03:24.070 --> 03:26.766
- Ladies, is that right?

03:26.810 --> 03:29.938
Do you find Miss Witham here
to be one of you?

03:32.290 --> 03:34.679
[Women snickering]

03:34.730 --> 03:38.336
Counting all the stars...

03:38.390 --> 03:41.291
- You could be sure
she'd be up for a roll.

03:41.350 --> 03:44.387
- Lorna Corbett?
She's got, like, 3 kids!

03:44.440 --> 03:47.079
- Yeah, and wound tighter
than a store-bought smoke.

03:47.130 --> 03:49.178
- We all know
how those burn.

03:49.220 --> 03:51.097
[All laughing]

03:52.310 --> 03:54.221
- Fire!

03:55.530 --> 03:59.443
Of an old familiar tune

04:01.930 --> 04:04.239
[Ringing]

04:07.980 --> 04:10.107
[Alarm sounding]

04:13.120 --> 04:14.849
- [Woman]: Oh my God!

04:17.770 --> 04:20.034
- [Gladys]: Maybe the enemy
bombed us out.

04:20.080 --> 04:22.298
- I heard German carriers
can launch 50 planes.

04:22.340 --> 04:23.739
- I think we'd know if Fritz

04:23.780 --> 04:25.475
were floating up
the Great Lakes.

04:25.520 --> 04:27.647
- That's a lot
of smoke though.

04:32.090 --> 04:34.968
[Panting]

04:35.010 --> 04:36.568
- Marco!

04:36.620 --> 04:39.180
- The boys need
our help! Come on!

04:39.230 --> 04:40.447
- [Woman]: Let's go!

04:42.020 --> 04:43.669
- Stop them.
They can't see this.

04:43.710 --> 04:46.531
- Edith, stop them!
You can't go there.

04:46.590 --> 04:48.012
- Hold on, girls!
Back inside.

04:48.070 --> 04:50.231
We'd only be in the way.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.713
- Ambulances. I gotta
take them to the test field.

04:52.770 --> 04:54.192
- Was it a bad test bomb?

04:54.250 --> 04:55.933
- One of the
Blue's 25-pounders.

04:55.990 --> 04:57.890
Misfire.
Shrapnel hit Archie.

04:57.940 --> 05:00.329
- We built
a bad bomb, girls.

05:00.380 --> 05:02.689
Back on the floor
and be quiet about it,

05:02.730 --> 05:04.857
or you'll all
be on the hook.

05:12.570 --> 05:14.731
- [Gladys]:
What do you think went wrong?

05:14.790 --> 05:17.179
- Just shut up
and keep working.

05:17.220 --> 05:18.391
- I will not shut up.

05:18.440 --> 05:20.579
If they want us to
keep building bombs,

05:20.620 --> 05:23.225
we need to know how to
avoid making mistakes.

05:29.850 --> 05:32.842
- They got an ambulance
to the field.

05:34.420 --> 05:36.149
- Good.

05:36.200 --> 05:38.543
- Any of that blood yours?

05:38.590 --> 05:40.546
- I don't know.

05:40.600 --> 05:42.989
I should've done something.

05:43.030 --> 05:47.205
- Marco, it was
a split-second.

05:47.250 --> 05:49.389
- Archie...

05:50.690 --> 05:53.341
There was so much blood.

05:53.390 --> 05:54.948
- He's alive.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.389
_That's the most
Important thing.

06:00.220 --> 06:01.778
- You watch.

06:01.830 --> 06:04.139
Someone will hang
for this.

06:04.180 --> 06:06.000
- I know.

06:13.020 --> 06:15.272
- It's St. Christopher.

06:16.550 --> 06:19.417
My father says that
if you trust him,

06:19.460 --> 06:22.247
he'll keep you safe
from accidents.

06:25.210 --> 06:27.599
I'm thinking Archie
needs this more than I do.

06:54.320 --> 06:57.665
- I hate thinking we might've
hurt our own workers,

06:57.720 --> 06:58.709
even by accident.

06:58.760 --> 06:59.749
- Likely a new girl.

06:59.810 --> 07:01.880
- Well, if you
think about it,

07:01.940 --> 07:04.841
any of us could be slipping up,
the way they got us working.

07:04.900 --> 07:07.368
Sometimes a girl needs a break.
You catch my drift?

07:07.420 --> 07:09.547
- And it's hard to breathe
with all the amatol.

07:09.600 --> 07:12.467
- There's times I can't see
if I'm filling these right.

07:12.510 --> 07:13.909
The light's all wonky.

07:13.950 --> 07:16.817
- Yeah. I never
noticed that before.

07:16.870 --> 07:20.340
- We could be building
bad bombs right this minute.

07:20.390 --> 07:22.346
- God's hands doing
the Devil's work.

07:22.390 --> 07:24.608
- It's bad enough the enemy's
trying to kill us.

07:24.660 --> 07:26.173
Now we can't be trusted.

07:34.580 --> 07:36.753
[Women gasping]

07:36.800 --> 07:39.883
- Ladies, today's mishap
is classified.

07:39.930 --> 07:42.751
It does not get discussed
outside these walls.

07:42.810 --> 07:44.937
Understand?

07:44.980 --> 07:47.289
Now, one of you overfilled
the amatol again.

07:47.330 --> 07:48.934
This kind of incompetence

07:48.990 --> 07:51.504
will be the ruin of
Victory Munitions

07:51.550 --> 07:53.370
and lose us this war!

07:53.420 --> 07:56.548
So we're retesting all of
you Blue girls tomorrow,

07:56.600 --> 07:59.387
same exam you took
to get in here.

07:59.430 --> 08:01.159
Fail it, you're fired.

08:03.130 --> 08:04.995
- Are the men
being tested?

08:05.040 --> 08:06.860
- Our men here
don't fill the bombs.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.433
- So the explosion's
our fault?

08:08.480 --> 08:09.788
How do you know
for certain?

08:09.830 --> 08:12.173
It could be the way
this place is set up.

08:12.230 --> 08:14.448
The factory's only
8 months old, right?

08:14.490 --> 08:16.264
There's always room
for improvement.

08:16.320 --> 08:18.402
Edith, you were saying
you had some ideas

08:18.450 --> 08:20.145
on how to make
this place better.

08:21.580 --> 08:23.889
- No idea what
you're talking about.

08:23.930 --> 08:27.673
- Betty? You were saying
about the--the trays?

08:27.720 --> 08:30.974
- It was just talk, sir.
Like women do.

08:31.030 --> 08:33.544
- Yeah.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.989
Chittering gossips,
the lot of you. Hmm?

08:36.030 --> 08:38.681
Well, keep your lips zipped
and pass the test

08:38.730 --> 08:40.379
or we pass on you.

08:40.430 --> 08:42.386
Compris?

08:47.910 --> 08:49.866
- Now he knows
we talk. Great!

08:49.920 --> 08:51.251
[Chuckles]

08:51.310 --> 08:53.619
- He's gonna be all
over us even worse now.

08:53.660 --> 08:55.821
- I barely passed
my first test.

08:55.880 --> 08:58.781
- Ijust wanted him to see
things the way we do.

08:58.840 --> 09:01.707
- "We"? It's not your ass
that'll get kicked out the door.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.012
And who feeds
my kids then?

09:03.060 --> 09:04.539
- Why don't
you take a hike?

09:04.580 --> 09:06.798
See if there's a
Girl Guide troop somewhere

09:06.850 --> 09:08.499
that's short
a patrol leader.

09:16.420 --> 09:17.933
- So he wants to retest us.

09:17.990 --> 09:19.412
I know my job inside out.

09:19.470 --> 09:21.028
- Take a few weeks off.

09:21.080 --> 09:22.684
- No, I need the money.

09:22.730 --> 09:25.517
Besides, it's--it's good
to be around the girls,

09:25.560 --> 09:26.868
doing something.

09:26.910 --> 09:28.810
- Writing letters
to your own kids?

09:29.870 --> 09:31.383
- From Doug.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.249
But Daphne and Skip,

09:33.310 --> 09:35.778
they recognize their
dad's handwriting.

09:35.830 --> 09:37.343
I can't copy it
worth a darn.

09:37.400 --> 09:39.527
- Edith...

09:39.570 --> 09:42.095
you need to
tell them the truth.

09:42.140 --> 09:45.132
- Could you break
your kid's heart,

09:45.190 --> 09:47.920
tell them Daddy was
shot down and died?

09:47.970 --> 09:50.973
They live for
his letters and...

09:51.020 --> 09:53.363
And right now, that's
what I can give them.

09:55.550 --> 09:57.711
- You need to focus
on what matters:

09:57.770 --> 09:59.328
keeping your job.

09:59.380 --> 10:00.722
OK?

10:03.860 --> 10:06.169
[James laughing]

10:06.210 --> 10:09.907
- So James brings his contacts
and entrepreneurial vision.

10:09.950 --> 10:13.340
- While Rollie brings
his grocery empire.

10:13.390 --> 10:17.303
- Witham Foods has unparalleled
food-supply contacts.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.523
- Together, we'll make
millions on this war.

10:19.570 --> 10:21.128
- I get why you want me, Jim.

10:21.180 --> 10:24.047
We've got the only factory big
enough to deliver your quotas.

10:24.100 --> 10:26.352
But our profit's bigger
on retail projects.

10:26.400 --> 10:28.265
We earn more
canning for folks here.

10:28.320 --> 10:30.572
- Except this deal
offers volume.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.622
- We will feed an entire
branch of the military.

10:33.670 --> 10:35.581
- Who says that
they'll ever eat it?

10:35.630 --> 10:38.679
Our army's loafing around
the English countryside eating

10:38.720 --> 10:40.108
bangers and clotted cream!

10:40.160 --> 10:41.718
- You think
that's all they do?

10:41.770 --> 10:44.113
- They sure as heck
aren't fighting.

10:44.160 --> 10:46.720
- Our troops are sinking
Axis ships in the Atlantic

10:46.770 --> 10:49.762
and protecting Britain from
Luftwaffe raids, Mr. Treleven.

10:49.820 --> 10:52.334
Sacrifices are made here
and overseas every day.

10:52.390 --> 10:54.073
- I don't much see it.
- You don't.

10:54.130 --> 10:57.031
So maybe you're not qualified
to talk about it.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.217
- My daughter's
lending her efforts

10:59.260 --> 11:00.784
to a munitions factory office.

11:00.830 --> 11:02.604
- Yes, up there with
the secretaries.

11:02.660 --> 11:05.128
And very good at it,
aren't you, dear?

11:05.180 --> 11:07.967
- I'd love to see a factory
full of sweet-faced gals.

11:08.010 --> 11:11.741
- We're too busy building bombs
that will destroy the enemy,

11:11.800 --> 11:14.314
an enemy you'd happily see
go into battle

11:14.360 --> 11:16.009
better fed
than our own men.

11:16.060 --> 11:18.403
- Gladys!

11:19.670 --> 11:21.012
- It was a long day.

11:21.070 --> 11:22.412
Please excuse me.

11:28.900 --> 11:33.291
- How many bad bombs
have we built?

11:37.520 --> 11:40.648
What if one
blew up overseas,

11:40.700 --> 11:42.861
in Gene or Stanley's face?

11:42.910 --> 11:44.821
- Come on now.
That's not gonna happen.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.952
- All the ways something
can go wrong...

11:47.010 --> 11:48.739
- I'll tell you
what's gonna go wrong,

11:48.790 --> 11:49.870
these fake letters.

11:51.310 --> 11:53.050
Their father died.

11:53.100 --> 11:54.965
It's cruel to carry
it on any further.

11:55.010 --> 11:56.796
- He has your penmanship, Bob.

11:56.840 --> 11:59.491
You could copy what
Edith's written.

11:59.540 --> 12:01.235
It'll cost you nothing.

12:01.280 --> 12:03.840
- You know I'm not
g0ing back there.

12:13.820 --> 12:17.199
- Since when does pouring coffee
for a factory manager

12:17.250 --> 12:19.389
entitle you to behave
like an impudent brat?

12:19.430 --> 12:21.739
- I clearly have nothing
to contribute.

12:21.780 --> 12:26.080
- There are other ways,
our ways to affect an outcome.

12:26.130 --> 12:28.178
So you powder your nose
and walk downstairs.

12:31.400 --> 12:35.609
and charm Tank Treleven's
cold, crass heart.

12:35.660 --> 12:38.481
That, dear Gladys,
is your job.

12:40.490 --> 12:41.969
[Sighs]

13:11.700 --> 13:14.567
[Sobbing]

13:21.880 --> 13:23.222
- Hey!

13:23.280 --> 13:25.578
They told me to
come on through.

13:26.980 --> 13:29.278
- Go away, Marco.
I'm tired.

13:29.330 --> 13:31.753
- You know,
I brought these for Archie,

13:31.810 --> 13:34.028
but he's all doped up
through Sunday.

13:34.070 --> 13:35.935
They're cannoli.

13:35.980 --> 13:37.766
Ever had one?

13:37.810 --> 13:39.983
Here. Go on.

13:40.030 --> 13:42.760
Wouldn't wanna see you
lose your curves.

13:44.690 --> 13:47.420
It's a soft cheese. Sweet.

13:47.470 --> 13:50.906
- Cheese in a donut?
That's disgusting.

13:50.960 --> 13:53.178
- Easy now!
They're my mother's.

13:59.090 --> 14:01.308
Vera...

14:03.050 --> 14:05.928
Uh, I've been feeling
kind of bad.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.699
I might have
distracted you.

14:07.750 --> 14:09.889
- It's terrible what
happened to Archie,

14:09.930 --> 14:12.057
being caught up in
that blast like that.

14:14.330 --> 14:15.843
- Yeah, last I remember,

14:15.890 --> 14:17.801
there was black smoke
all around us.

14:17.850 --> 14:20.671
The smoke shouldn't
have been black.

14:20.720 --> 14:24.599
- Your mother,
tell her they're good.

14:24.640 --> 14:27.905
And you,
don't flatter yourself.

14:27.950 --> 14:29.906
I've had better.

14:29.950 --> 14:31.508
[Chuckles]

14:33.480 --> 14:35.994
I bet you're the belle of
the ball around here, huh?

14:36.040 --> 14:39.339
- I haven't
left my room yet.

14:40.400 --> 14:42.436
- Vera...

14:42.490 --> 14:45.709
There's first impressions,

14:45.750 --> 14:48.799
and then there's what
you make after that.

14:48.840 --> 14:51.889
Believe me,
I know all about it.

14:56.280 --> 14:58.407
- And no offence, Jimmy,

14:58.460 --> 15:01.452
but you sure found yourself
one heck of a sleepy town.

15:01.500 --> 15:04.765
I'd kill for some kicks.
- There's the symphony tomorrow.

15:04.810 --> 15:06.858
- This town's got
5 girls to every guy.

15:06.900 --> 15:09.027
You think I want some
stale solo viola?

15:09.080 --> 15:11.548
- If it's lovely ladies
you're after,

15:11.600 --> 15:14.296
there's a dance at the _
Sandy Shores PaVIlion on Friday.

15:14.340 --> 15:15.682
- That's hardly a good area.

15:15.740 --> 15:17.514
- Actually, it's not so bad.

15:17.560 --> 15:20.028
- All right then.
Let's meet Sandy.

15:20.090 --> 15:22.308
- One benefit to this war,
Mr. Treleven,

15:22.350 --> 15:24.261
it's bombed_out
your competition.

15:26.010 --> 15:27.432
[Chuckles]

15:27.490 --> 15:30.050
- [Announcer]:
Luftwaffe forces

15:30.100 --> 15:33.058
continue its sporadic air raids in England's northeast...

15:33.100 --> 15:35.011
- The Ministry of Defence?

15:35.060 --> 15:37.016
You're writing the minister,

15:37.060 --> 15:39.528
telling them my girls are
"subpar female employees"?

15:39.590 --> 15:41.273
This is total fabrication!

15:41.330 --> 15:44.288
It could've easily been
one of the men.

15:44.330 --> 15:46.104
- Two men were
sent to hospital.

15:46.160 --> 15:48.674
Marco Moretti nearly had
his head blown off.

15:48.730 --> 15:50.948
We need to find
the weak link now.

15:50.990 --> 15:53.891
We can't be sending
bad bombs to our boys.

15:55.340 --> 15:57.513
- [Lorna]:
All right, ladies!

15:59.170 --> 16:02.469
It's test time.
Let's begin.

16:06.660 --> 16:08.434
[Air sucking]

16:16.750 --> 16:18.536
[Gasps]

16:19.930 --> 16:22.444
Is there a problem,
Miss Witham?

16:22.500 --> 16:24.752
- Hunky-dory, Mrs. Corbett.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.111
- [Marco]: Problems?

16:35.160 --> 16:37.981
Do you think you can
get away with this?

16:42.300 --> 16:44.029
If anyone finds out
about this,

16:44.090 --> 16:46.775
there's gonna be
big problems for all of us.

16:49.350 --> 16:51.045
Get back to work.

17:14.290 --> 17:16.804
- Miss Andrews, uh,

17:16.860 --> 17:20.114
your file here
shows training papers,

17:20.160 --> 17:23.379
birth certificate,
but no security clearance.

17:23.430 --> 17:27.036
- Must be an oversight.
I can bring in my copy tomorrow.

17:27.080 --> 17:28.422
- Please do.

17:28.480 --> 17:31.608
I wouldn't wanna have to
bother the authorities.

17:31.650 --> 17:33.993
- No, I wouldn't
want that either.

17:41.320 --> 17:43.402
[Kate coughing]

17:45.840 --> 17:48.400
I heard they're supposed
to relax you.

17:49.670 --> 17:51.228
- Sure wasn't easy in there,

17:51.280 --> 17:53.544
with Lorna breathing
down our necks.

17:55.770 --> 17:58.546
Yesterday, I was only
trying to help out.

17:58.590 --> 18:00.933
- Except nobody
put you in charge.

18:00.990 --> 18:03.982
My father, he says God
gives grace to the humble.

18:04.030 --> 18:06.112
- So we're just
supposed to stay quiet

18:06.170 --> 18:07.774
and take the blame

18:07.820 --> 18:10.812
when the whole system here
could be the problem?

18:10.870 --> 18:14.567
- Nobody wants a Joan of Arc
to lead us into battle.

18:14.610 --> 18:17.261
Let's just put
our heads down...

18:18.440 --> 18:20.044
and work.

18:20.090 --> 18:23.093
Let me have my revelry

18:23.140 --> 18:25.222
For it's only

18:25.270 --> 18:28.967
Just a stone's throw away

18:29.020 --> 18:31.796
- I'm not protecting anyone.

18:31.840 --> 18:33.626
Look at the results.

18:33.670 --> 18:36.059
Every woman met
our standards.

18:36.110 --> 18:37.543
- Of course you'd say that.

18:37.590 --> 18:39.490
- Mr. Moretti and George Dawson

18:39.550 --> 18:42.326
had a confrontation today
over somebody's mistake,

18:42.380 --> 18:43.677
perhaps themistake.

18:43.730 --> 18:45.288
- Marco may be
a tetchy Italian,

18:45.340 --> 18:47.069
but he knows
how to do his job.

18:47.120 --> 18:48.849
- If nobody's off the mark,

18:48.910 --> 18:51.037
I can't just
toss you a scapegoat.

18:51.080 --> 18:53.389
- Someone on that list
tested lowest.

18:53.430 --> 18:54.988
That's who we're firing.

18:56.350 --> 18:57.863
- Gladys Witham.

18:59.440 --> 19:01.431
Sir, she doesn't
need the job.

19:01.480 --> 19:05.393
You can see,
all my girls passed.

19:05.440 --> 19:07.783
Right here, Lorna,
the lowest score.

19:07.840 --> 19:09.489
That's my girl.

19:09.530 --> 19:12.613
Unless you'd rather it be
your name I put on the letter.

19:21.070 --> 19:23.106
- Seems you can't get
out of here either.

19:23.160 --> 19:25.856
They had me run the
coveralls down to laundry,

19:25.900 --> 19:27.629
if you can believe that.

19:27.680 --> 19:30.808
So how was testing?
No laugh riot, I bet.

19:30.860 --> 19:33.112
- Some girls did
better than others.

19:33.170 --> 19:35.297
- Oh dear, are we
canning a tenderfoot?

19:35.340 --> 19:38.810
- I'm afraid
Gladys Witham did fine.

19:38.870 --> 19:42.988
Even, uh, Kate Andrews
scored high.

19:44.220 --> 19:45.824
- Oh no. No.

19:45.880 --> 19:48.087
No, no, no.
Don't you dare say it.

19:48.140 --> 19:49.653
- Harold Akins
needed someone--

19:49.710 --> 19:51.610
- And you picked me
to fire?

19:51.660 --> 19:54.311
- I am only shift matron here.
You think I can control--

19:54.360 --> 19:56.578
- Lorna, you and I started
together on the line

19:56.630 --> 19:57.790
from day one.

19:57.840 --> 20:00.013
- If you'd done better
in the test...

20:01.280 --> 20:02.884
- I wonder
why I didn't.

20:02.940 --> 20:05.454
Aside from not
sleeping a wink

20:05.500 --> 20:07.582
since my husband
was blown to bits

20:07.640 --> 20:10.063
or worrying how I'm
gonna raise 2 kids

20:10.120 --> 20:13.248
or how I still can't_tell them
Daddy's never coming home?

20:13.290 --> 20:14.723
Aside from all that,

20:14.770 --> 20:17.204
I can't imagine what took
my head out of the game.

20:18.860 --> 20:20.908
- You'll get
another job easy.

20:20.950 --> 20:22.998
- As the gal blamed
for blowing up our men?

20:23.040 --> 20:24.382
I'm_ sure offers
Will flood in.

20:24.440 --> 20:26.214
- Look, I'll try
and fix this.

20:26.260 --> 20:28.433
- You know, I feel
sorry for you, Lorna.

20:30.270 --> 20:32.659
You're lost in this
place Without me.

20:39.540 --> 20:41.531
[Woman giggling]

20:50.550 --> 20:53.371
- Darn it!
Darn it all to heck!

20:56.730 --> 20:58.948
- I'm guessing crafts
aren't your bag.

20:58.990 --> 21:00.332
Me either.

21:00.380 --> 21:03.258
You should've seen the one
potholder I ever crocheted.

21:03.300 --> 21:05.860
I've seen fried eggs
with better edging.

21:05.910 --> 21:07.992
- Who said you
could come in here?

21:08.040 --> 21:10.122
- Is this your security report?
- Don't look.

21:10.180 --> 21:11.909
- Kate, you need
this to work.

21:11.960 --> 21:14.565
- It's not real.

21:15.970 --> 21:17.301
- Why?

21:17.360 --> 21:19.260
- Because Kate Andrews
doesn't exist.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.538
- How did you get
your other papers?

21:21.580 --> 21:23.536
- My mother helped me
buy false ones.

21:23.580 --> 21:26.401
But no security report.
They're too hard to forge.

21:26.450 --> 21:27.883
They've got
seals, watermarks.

21:27.930 --> 21:29.978
If my father finds me,

21:30.020 --> 21:33.023
he'll make sure I _can
never leave again.

21:34.720 --> 21:36.893
- I may know someone.

21:36.940 --> 21:38.544
- Oh, Betty...

21:39.640 --> 21:41.289
- The thing is,
I'd need to know

21:41.340 --> 21:43.467
how much you were
Willing to offer up.

21:43.510 --> 21:45.466
- I'll borrow.
I'll pay what it costs.

21:45.520 --> 21:48.557
- But it might not
be money that he wants.

21:50.700 --> 21:52.952
- This man can forge me
decent papers?

21:53.000 --> 21:55.787
- He could get Satan a visa
through the Pearly Gates.

21:55.830 --> 21:58.355
- Then let me worry
about the price.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.789
Just take me to
see him. Please.

22:14.550 --> 22:16.108
_ 1--

22:16.160 --> 22:18.287
- You hand him
a silver-platter deal,

22:18.330 --> 22:19.934
and this is
how he repays us?

22:19.990 --> 22:21.639
- He's taking a meeting.
That's it.

22:21.680 --> 22:22.942
- With our competition!

22:22.990 --> 22:24.981
Your bastard friend
has crossed the street,

22:25.030 --> 22:27.373
taking our pitch to
bloody Steinham Foods!

22:27.430 --> 22:28.510
- Hello, Father.

22:28.560 --> 22:30.289
A thrilling
day at the office?

22:30.340 --> 22:32.558
- Don't worry.
We'll get him back.

22:32.610 --> 22:35.386
- That weasel can go hang.
I will find somebody else.

22:35.440 --> 22:37.123
- We won't Win the bid
Without him.

22:37.180 --> 22:39.045
Nobody else has his
scale of operation

22:39.090 --> 22:40.307
or his access to metals.

22:40.350 --> 22:42.568
- Do not tell me
how to run my busmess.

22:42.620 --> 22:44.838
- You and James are in
this together, Father.

22:44.880 --> 22:46.268
He brought you this deal.

22:46.320 --> 22:48.402
- Gladys, I'll see you
in the garden.

22:48.450 --> 22:50.270
- Why do you even
wanna be in business

22:50.320 --> 22:51.753
with a lout like
Tank Treleven?

22:51.800 --> 22:53.791
He doesn't give a fig
about our soldiers.

22:53.850 --> 22:55.454
It's all the bottom line
with him.

22:55.500 --> 22:58.014
- Advice from the one
who ruined last night's dinner.

22:58.070 --> 22:59.549
- "Ruined"?
That's a bit rich.

22:59.590 --> 23:01.808
- Well, what would
you call it then?

23:01.850 --> 23:04.933
- Your daughter reminded us all
Why we're in this business:

23:04.990 --> 23:06.639
to help win a war.

23:06.680 --> 23:09.376
- Well, I'm sure as hell
not in it to lose.

23:09.430 --> 23:12.422
- Well, you will, if you
only fight for yourself.

23:12.470 --> 23:14.472
- And who are you
fighting for, my dear?

23:14.520 --> 23:17.421
It's all just a chance
to play dress-up for you.

23:17.480 --> 23:19.778
This week it's Hepburn.

23:19.830 --> 23:22.048
Next it's Crawford
or Greer Garson.

23:22.090 --> 23:24.615
- Gladys believes
in the cause.

23:24.660 --> 23:28.778
- Yes. So long as the cause
features her in a starring role.

23:28.840 --> 23:31.400
She showed last night that
she's not a team player.

Hey, your face,

24:33.250 --> 24:35.980
it's not so bad.

You watch. You are gonna
be as right as rain.

you gotta do better.

I can work with your up-front
assets and pretty smile,

25:31.610 --> 25:35.171
but first you gotta
show it to me, hmm?

25:37.620 --> 25:39.224
- It's OK.
You can do this.

one of these before.

27:50.530 --> 27:52.919
You know who they
should have fired?

27:52.970 --> 27:55.962
A hat box? Hoping to
improve on our turbans?

27:56.020 --> 27:58.716
- Our turbans are perfect,
but some things aren't.

27:58.760 --> 28:01.194
The women who work here
know that better than anyone.

28:01.240 --> 28:03.845

No repercussions.

28:06.420 --> 28:08.024
That just means
that no one--

What can Mr. Akins do?

28:35.100 --> 28:37.182

on these 25-pounders.

28:37.230 --> 28:40.313
Amatol needs to be 60-40
ammonium nitrate to TNT.

28:40.370 --> 28:42.315
Too much TN_T in the
mix means disaster.

28:42.370 --> 28:43.883
A disaster like
the one we had.

28:43.930 --> 28:45.716
- Interesting theory, Moretti.

28:45.760 --> 28:47.933
- It's not a theory.
The smoke was black.

28:47.980 --> 28:49.766
That means there
was too much TNT.

your holy madonnas.

29:00.170 --> 29:01.330
They make mistakes.

29:01.390 --> 29:02.994

you on, Moretti?

You better make up
your mind.

- Well, I ain't busting a gut!

36:59.820 --> 37:03.517
- So you've got your mints
and your cola and...

37:03.560 --> 37:04.959
a new toothbrush,

37:05.000 --> 37:07.218
since I can't stand to
see you come out of here

37:07.260 --> 37:09.125
with your teeth
rotted out of your head.

37:10.310 --> 37:13.222
It's the mother in me.
I can't help it.

37:13.270 --> 37:16.137
Speaking of which,
I should shove off.

37:16.190 --> 37:18.090
- Thanks for the visit, hey.

37:18.140 --> 37:22.531
- Yeah. It's nice to see
a friendly face.

37:24.150 --> 37:27.017
- Actually, there's one more
thing if you don't mind.

37:27.070 --> 37:28.412
It's kind of ridiculous.

37:28.460 --> 37:29.939
- Try me.

37:29.980 --> 37:32.369
- I was wondering if
you might sit with me

37:32.420 --> 37:34.809
and let me brush your hair
for a spell.

37:34.860 --> 37:36.543
- Well, I gotta warn you,

37:36.600 --> 37:38.898
it gets pretty ratty
back there.

37:38.950 --> 37:40.463
- I don't mind.

37:42.690 --> 37:46.251
It's how I used to
settle myself before bed.

37:46.300 --> 37:49.258
- I guess the war
pretty much kicked

37:49.310 --> 37:51.824
the girly girl
out of us, didn't it?

37:57.230 --> 37:58.834
You OK?

37:58.880 --> 38:00.609
- Yeah, yeah.

38:00.660 --> 38:04.278
I'm just feeling
things coming back.

38:15.290 --> 38:18.509
- [Woman]:
Oh, I need a pack of smokes.

38:21.860 --> 38:23.908
- If you'll excuse us.

38:25.600 --> 38:27.465
- You're raining on
my parade, Lorna.

38:27.520 --> 38:29.511
- George Dawson
is the only person

38:29.560 --> 38:31.289
responsible for
that accident.

38:31.350 --> 38:32.647
You knew it.

38:32.700 --> 38:34.827
You protected him,
the same as Harold did.

38:34.870 --> 38:36.178
- You think I rolled over

38:36.220 --> 38:38.347
and watched an innocent
person get punished?

38:38.400 --> 38:40.095
- Well, if you
didn't, then--

38:40.140 --> 38:42.654
- I'm an outsider,
Lorna, just like you.

38:42.710 --> 38:45.406
You think I got any
more sway than you do?

38:45.450 --> 38:47.793
- Then we'll circle
the wagons too.

38:47.840 --> 38:51.276
In 24 hours, every woman who
works that line is gonna know

38:51.320 --> 38:54.323
that the drunken sod
who got us into this mess

38:54.370 --> 38:55.849
got off with a warning.

38:55.890 --> 38:58.199
You watch Harold's quota
go down the tubes.

38:58.240 --> 39:00.196
- You think your girls
would do that?

39:00.250 --> 39:03.799
- After today,
I know they would.

39:03.860 --> 39:05.634
You tell him _that
in the morning.

39:05.690 --> 39:07.681
You're still a man,
aren't you?

39:07.730 --> 39:10.119
- You asking for proof?

39:10.170 --> 39:14.732
- I want you to
talk to our boss.

39:14.780 --> 39:17.954
For some ridiculous reason,
you're the only person that--

39:24.440 --> 39:25.919
Seeing as how you nearly

39:25.970 --> 39:28.438
got your brains
blown out, Mr. Moretti,

39:28.490 --> 39:30.139
I'll forget this
ever happened.

39:32.760 --> 39:36.400
- I'll talk to Harold and get
your friend her job back.

39:36.460 --> 39:39.418
I wouldn't want you to feel
this was a wasted trip.

39:54.210 --> 39:55.734
- Hi.

39:57.170 --> 40:00.606
You were splendid.
Our Joan of Arc.

40:02.700 --> 40:04.520
- I gotta admit, princess,

40:04.570 --> 40:06.913
you handled that rat
like a pro.

40:10.270 --> 40:12.261
- Can you
excuse me a sec?

40:12.320 --> 40:14.538
Jimmy, I wish
I could give you

40:14.580 --> 40:16.445
a firm answer
While I'm here,

40:16.500 --> 40:18.843
but you're not the
only game in town.

40:18.890 --> 40:20.232
- No hard feelings.

40:20.280 --> 40:21.759
We've already
started tendering

40:21.810 --> 40:23.232
other potential partners.

40:23.290 --> 40:25.895
- I thought you said you
couldn't find anyone better.

40:25.940 --> 40:29.068
- You're not the only man
who can make a tin can.

40:29.120 --> 40:31.725
Because make no mistake,
Witham Foods has the contacts

40:31.770 --> 40:33.635
and the reputation
to win this contract,

40:33.690 --> 40:36.818
not these little companies
you've been talking to.

40:38.740 --> 40:40.253
Relax, Tank.

40:40.300 --> 40:43.167
You'll get a wedding invitation
no matter What happens.

40:46.740 --> 40:48.788
- Yeah, she's
a firecracker, that one.

40:48.830 --> 40:50.786
- Yeah, when you
add it all up,

40:50.830 --> 40:53.708
this war's the best thing
that ever happened to us.

41:00.190 --> 41:02.408
- I barely recognize myself.

41:03.720 --> 41:05.802
- This is the new you.

41:09.240 --> 41:10.935
And this is for you.

41:10.990 --> 41:12.412
- Oh, Betty!

41:12.470 --> 41:14.893
It's the hairpin.

41:14.950 --> 41:17.202
Thank you.
- Oh, it's nothing.

41:17.250 --> 41:19.718
- I am so lucky
I met you.

41:22.260 --> 41:25.605
- You know those nightmares
you're having,

41:25.650 --> 41:29.381
if you ever wanna
sleep over here...

41:30.440 --> 41:32.260
- That's very kind.

41:32.310 --> 41:35.359
But I think I'll be having
better dreams now.

41:36.750 --> 41:40.789
- Well, that's just grand.

41:43.020 --> 41:46.183
- Mmm! It was a fun dance.

41:46.240 --> 41:48.970
There sure were
some dreamboats.

41:49.020 --> 41:52.547
- Yes, definitely.
Good night.

41:52.590 --> 41:54.114
- Good night.

42:04.520 --> 42:06.556
[Groaning]

42:08.870 --> 42:11.088
- Bob?

42:11.130 --> 42:12.688
Bob, wake up.

42:12.740 --> 42:14.298
[Gasps]

42:20.010 --> 42:21.875
[Sighs]

42:27.840 --> 42:31.014
I got Mr. Moretti
to talk with Harold.

42:31.070 --> 42:32.583
- Mm-hmm.

42:32.630 --> 42:35.281
- Get Edith her job back.

42:35.330 --> 42:36.809
[Chuckles]

42:36.850 --> 42:39.193
- Well, I hope she
builds her bombs better

42:39.250 --> 42:40.979
than she writes
her letters.

42:41.990 --> 42:43.810
- You copied them out?

42:43.860 --> 42:48.297
- No. I wrote
new ones instead.

42:48.340 --> 42:51.514
- That was
very nice of you.

42:53.260 --> 42:55.865
- So, the Eyetie,

42:55.920 --> 42:59.083
he's not quite the enemy
you thought he was, hey?

42:59.140 --> 43:01.563
- I don't like him.

43:04.530 --> 43:06.316
A man like Mr. Moretti

43:06.360 --> 43:08.794
should not be working
at the factory.

43:10.190 --> 43:13.148
It's a disaster
waiting to happen.

43:14.590 --> 43:16.808
- Well then, Lorna...

43:18.160 --> 43:20.151
you get him out.

43:21.380 --> 43:23.462
- I will.

43:25.080 --> 43:27.594
I just gotta
figure out how.
