00:14.297 --> 00:18.343
There was something was pulling me...

00:18.344 --> 00:21.044
Up the mountain.

00:22.731 --> 00:28.491
Chris would come back from the
grave, just to protect him.

00:29.461 --> 00:32.073
I really don't know what it was.

00:32.073 --> 00:35.036
I can't explain it.

00:35.037 --> 00:40.437
And I said, nobody's gonna
believe, what's happening.

00:41.233 --> 00:42.954
She'd had premonitions before.

00:42.955 --> 00:46.075
But this was so real.

00:47.799 --> 00:49.346
Whoa!

00:49.347 --> 00:52.287
She died on impact.

00:54.479 --> 00:57.179
It's behind us!

01:22.019 --> 01:26.399
We'd been visiting family in Sacramento.

01:26.555 --> 01:32.455
I just sat up in bed and had this thing
inside me that I needed to go home.

01:32.646 --> 01:35.715
And I needed to go home then.

01:35.716 --> 01:38.776
I just felt like there was something...

01:38.777 --> 01:41.957
Pulling me up mountain.

01:43.060 --> 01:45.828
We jumped in the car, we drove...

01:45.829 --> 01:48.138
It was late.

01:48.139 --> 01:51.199
We're on Highway 50.

01:53.108 --> 01:56.222
I don't like traveling the
mountain at night time.

01:56.223 --> 01:58.067
It's uh..

01:58.068 --> 02:01.380
Really a windy and twisty road.

02:01.381 --> 02:04.741
You can go off the road.

02:06.242 --> 02:09.901
I was looking out the window.

02:10.704 --> 02:14.232
And as we were going around Bullion Bend...

02:14.233 --> 02:19.442
On the side of the road I see
this blackish white thing.

02:19.443 --> 02:23.283
And I didn't know what it was.

02:23.627 --> 02:29.527
And when I was right up on it,
I could tell it was a woman.

02:30.893 --> 02:35.782
She was naked, totally
naked, and really white.

02:35.783 --> 02:39.983
I know that I saw her on that road.

03:16.424 --> 03:20.984
I have two kids, Christine was the oldest.

03:21.498 --> 03:27.138
Christine was very bubbly, very
outgoing, very independent.

03:29.178 --> 03:32.538
Chris a little boy, Nick.

03:33.062 --> 03:37.199
She a mother that every
boy would love to have.

03:37.200 --> 03:40.320
One, two three... Woo!

03:40.481 --> 03:43.363
Chris was really ambitious.

03:43.364 --> 03:47.923
She worked a couple of jobs to
put herself through college.

03:47.924 --> 03:52.616
And when she finally graduated,
she um, got a job as a paralegal.

03:52.617 --> 03:56.758
600 miles away, down in
Southern California.

03:56.759 --> 03:59.691
- You guys have fun, huh?
- Alright I really gotta go.

03:59.692 --> 04:02.286
Finally the time came
when she had to leave.

04:02.287 --> 04:04.927
Okay, have fun.

04:05.271 --> 04:09.608
It was kind of sad, to see them going...

04:09.609 --> 04:14.211
But was a happy time, because she had
what she worked for, for so hard.

04:14.212 --> 04:16.562
- I'll see you guys later.
- Okay. Bye.

04:16.563 --> 04:17.769
See ya.

04:17.769 --> 04:21.699
Chris said she would call
us in a couple days, and...

04:21.700 --> 04:25.120
We said, okay, no problem.

04:31.269 --> 04:35.855
Wednesday morning, we got a
call from a friend of Chris.

04:35.856 --> 04:37.069
Hello.

04:37.070 --> 04:39.195
She said, hey, Chris isn't here.

04:39.196 --> 04:41.746
She was supposed to be here,
don't you guy's care.

04:41.747 --> 04:43.331
I said, "what are you talking about?"

04:43.332 --> 04:46.247
She supposed to be on her way
down to Southern California.

04:46.248 --> 04:49.233
And she goes, well, she was
supposed be here Monday.

04:49.234 --> 04:51.403
And here it's Wednesday morning.

04:51.404 --> 04:54.928
Yes, yes, I'm trying to
track down my daughter.

04:54.929 --> 04:58.202
Then you know we started uh,
getting a little worried.

04:58.203 --> 05:01.004
They could be anywhere.

05:01.005 --> 05:03.294
I'm wondering if you have a record...

05:03.295 --> 05:05.961
We called the hospitals.

05:05.962 --> 05:07.954
We called the Police Department.

05:07.955 --> 05:10.571
Yeah, I'd like to report
a missing person...

05:10.572 --> 05:12.926
Uh, the response was...

05:12.927 --> 05:18.827
Well, that's only 48 hours, and we
get 200 calls like that a week.

05:19.363 --> 05:25.263
They um, more or less said well
she'll show up, don't worry about it.

05:32.041 --> 05:33.817
The first time I heard about this case,

05:33.818 --> 05:36.481
I was working for the Eldorado
County Sheriff's Department.

05:36.482 --> 05:39.490
And my assignment at the
time was working patrol.

05:39.491 --> 05:41.366
Graveyard patrol shift.

05:41.367 --> 05:43.187
We've got a missing person.

05:43.188 --> 05:46.744
We got a adult female,
traveling with a young boy.

05:46.745 --> 05:48.315
Unknown direction of travel.

05:48.316 --> 05:50.798
The case with Christine
initially was just...

05:50.799 --> 05:53.379
A mother and her son who were
moving to Southern California.

05:53.380 --> 05:55.647
Family has no idea where they went.

05:55.648 --> 05:57.689
There's people reported
missing all the time.

05:57.690 --> 05:59.692
You know every day,
through out this country.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.477
Also got an assault with a knife.

06:01.478 --> 06:03.879
There was nothing out of the ordinary.

06:03.880 --> 06:06.139
I thought it was just another...

06:06.140 --> 06:09.042
I hate to say it, but a routine
missing persons report.

06:09.043 --> 06:13.363
It was like, okay, what do we do now?

06:21.267 --> 06:24.036
We were handing out fliers.

06:24.037 --> 06:27.457
And we went to everyplace.

06:27.971 --> 06:33.871
Where there was a restaurant, a home,
gas station, shopping markets.

06:33.971 --> 06:39.086
We told people that our daughter's
been missing for 3 days.

06:39.087 --> 06:42.462
And if they had seen her...

06:42.463 --> 06:45.103
Please call us.

07:20.497 --> 07:26.389
We were at home when the phone rang, and
it was my Sister-in-law 600 miles away.

07:26.390 --> 07:29.871
- Hi, Karen.
- Dave, I just had an awful dream...

07:29.872 --> 07:33.592
She called, was kinda, frantic.

07:33.798 --> 07:35.522
And said he had a dream.

07:35.523 --> 07:39.363
It was dark, there was lights...

07:41.003 --> 07:44.003
She could see Nicki.

07:44.317 --> 07:47.423
Some lights, she said.

07:47.424 --> 07:49.671
No, Christine wasn't in
it, it was just Nicki.

07:49.672 --> 07:54.772
And the number 16 kept
popping up over and over.

07:55.200 --> 07:59.845
It was like 2 or 3 times I kept
seeing number this number 16.

07:59.846 --> 08:04.346
She kept seeing the number 16 popping up.

08:04.591 --> 08:07.031
At the time I didn't know what 16 meant.

08:07.032 --> 08:08.570
Just try and stay calm.

08:08.571 --> 08:10.802
The dream was vivid enough
that she believed in it.

08:10.803 --> 08:12.789
Yeah, but I have to come down to see you.

08:12.790 --> 08:15.951
She had premonitions before,
but this was so real,

08:15.952 --> 08:20.512
she knew that she was going to find them.

08:33.889 --> 08:39.499
On Friday I was approached by the Detective
that had been assigned to this case.

08:39.500 --> 08:42.671
And he suspected that perhaps she
has stopped at one of the...

08:42.672 --> 08:48.572
The all night 24 hour gas stations
in Placerville to fill up her car.

08:49.008 --> 08:52.858
There was I believe 4 gas stations in
this immediate area we were looking for.

08:52.859 --> 08:56.022
And I began asking them if
they had any recollection,

08:56.023 --> 08:58.623
um, of seeing this girl, this vehicle.

08:58.624 --> 09:03.604
If anything sounded familiar
or similar to them.

09:06.700 --> 09:09.442
I remember going to the gas
station station in Placerville.

09:09.443 --> 09:12.777
And I specifically recall
going in, and the clerk...

09:12.778 --> 09:15.395
Um, he was a younger guy that worked there.

09:15.396 --> 09:18.478
- They were in this area 2 or3 days ago.
- Yeah, yeah, I remember of seeing them.

09:18.479 --> 09:19.779
- You saw them?
- Yes.

09:19.780 --> 09:21.396
- He remembered her.
- When?

09:21.397 --> 09:24.097
Um, 3 days ago.

09:24.421 --> 09:28.218
He recalled the car, he remembered
a little boy was with her.

09:28.219 --> 09:30.609
The son just waited in the car.

09:30.610 --> 09:32.739
He didn't know the license plate
he didn't know if it matched.

09:32.740 --> 09:35.250
But the girl, the picture
that was on the flier.

09:35.251 --> 09:41.151
Seemed to resemble the girl that he
remembered having a conversation with.

09:53.242 --> 09:56.987
- They were in this area 2 or3 days ago.
- Yeah, yeah, I remember of seeing them.

09:56.988 --> 09:58.241
- You saw them?
- Yes.

09:58.242 --> 10:04.142
He remembered her, he recalled the car,
he remembered a little boy was with her.

10:07.417 --> 10:09.369
Hello, how are you tonight?

10:09.370 --> 10:12.583
He said that she bought a couple sodas,
and they had some small talk...

10:12.584 --> 10:16.406
- Where you off to?
- I'm going to California. For a new job.

10:16.407 --> 10:19.080
And he remembers her
saying she's really tired,

10:19.081 --> 10:21.623
but she's got to make the drive, she's
going to go up and see a friend.

10:21.624 --> 10:24.690
You know, and having to make
that drive up Highway 50.

10:24.691 --> 10:27.686
He remembered specifically
two things in particular...

10:27.687 --> 10:29.218
Her being tired.

10:29.219 --> 10:31.877
And her having to drive through
these winding mountain roads,

10:31.878 --> 10:35.363
to go up there to go see a friend.

10:35.364 --> 10:37.239
Thanks.

10:37.240 --> 10:40.649
All kinds of things entered my mind...

10:40.650 --> 10:43.122
She could have been involved in a accident,

10:43.123 --> 10:46.287
she could have driven off the road,
she could have had car trouble and...

10:46.288 --> 10:49.130
And somebody else could have
you know stopped to help her,

10:49.131 --> 10:52.305
and ended up taking her and the car.

10:52.306 --> 10:54.886
We were concerned that maybe
did she get in to an accident?

10:54.887 --> 10:57.106
Did she meet with some foul play?

10:57.107 --> 11:02.147
I mean any number of things
could have happened.

11:30.639 --> 11:33.434
We'd been visiting family in Sacramento.

11:33.435 --> 11:38.056
And uh, around 2am I woke my
husband up and told him...

11:38.057 --> 11:41.117
I needed to go home.

11:41.142 --> 11:44.177
I eventually started shaking him awake.

11:44.178 --> 11:45.799
- We have to go.
- What?

11:45.800 --> 11:48.573
- We need to go home.
- We can't just go tomorrow?

11:48.574 --> 11:51.369
And he was saying, can't
we wait until tomorrow?

11:51.370 --> 11:52.845
I said no. I want to go now.

11:52.846 --> 11:55.766
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

11:55.767 --> 11:59.218
I needed to leave right now.

11:59.219 --> 12:03.232
Normally I would have just
went back to sleep, but...

12:03.233 --> 12:08.015
I just kept bothering him
until he finally said "okay".

12:08.016 --> 12:10.716
Okay, we'll go.

12:15.065 --> 12:18.125
I just felt like there was something...

12:18.126 --> 12:21.606
Pulling me up the mountain.

12:28.219 --> 12:34.119
When you drive from Sacramento to Lake
Tahoe, it turns in to the mountains.

12:36.923 --> 12:39.983
We're on Highway 50.

12:40.258 --> 12:41.649
It was odd because...

12:41.650 --> 12:44.468
I don't like traveling the
mountain at night time.

12:44.469 --> 12:48.789
It's uh, really windy and twisty road.

12:49.302 --> 12:52.662
You can go off the road.

12:53.147 --> 12:56.807
I was looking out the window.

12:58.562 --> 13:01.631
And as we were going around Bullion Bend...

13:01.632 --> 13:05.852
On the side of the road I see
this blackish white thing.

13:05.853 --> 13:09.585
And I didn't know what it was.

13:09.586 --> 13:15.486
And when I was right up on it
I could tell it was a woman.

13:16.327 --> 13:21.127
She was naked, totally
naked and really white

13:22.094 --> 13:26.835
I could see her body, and could
see that it was a woman...

13:26.836 --> 13:30.676
But I could not see her shadow.

13:31.182 --> 13:33.471
I just saw a dead woman
on the side of the road.

13:33.472 --> 13:34.827
What? What?

13:34.828 --> 13:36.033
- Do you want me to stop?
- No. No.

13:36.034 --> 13:38.411
- My husband wanted to stop.
- Are you sure, we can go back.

13:38.412 --> 13:42.364
And he said he was going to go back
because he could probably help her.

13:42.365 --> 13:44.710
What if she wasn't dead, and I told him no.

13:44.711 --> 13:47.513
I didn't want to go back.

13:47.514 --> 13:49.032
She may be a ploy...

13:49.033 --> 13:52.421
You know what if somebody
was in the woods waiting...

13:52.422 --> 13:55.831
To come out and then take our
car, or take us with the car.

13:55.832 --> 13:58.232
Or kill us.

14:00.437 --> 14:03.540
I asked him to please,
find the nearest phone.

14:03.541 --> 14:06.691
There's a phone right there.

14:06.692 --> 14:10.083
We drove on about another quarter mile.

14:10.084 --> 14:13.438
There's a ranger station
up on the mountain.

14:13.439 --> 14:14.886
And I called 911.

14:14.887 --> 14:17.253
Hi I'd like to uh...

14:17.254 --> 14:19.938
Report a body on the side of the road.

14:19.939 --> 14:25.839
They told me somebody would there and
to get in the truck and lock the door.

14:33.617 --> 14:37.962
We sat in the car and we waited,
which seemed like hours.

14:37.963 --> 14:41.743
Which was probably just minutes.

14:43.204 --> 14:46.068
The cop car pulled up.

14:46.069 --> 14:49.017
And I jumped out of the car and I told him,

14:49.018 --> 14:51.533
that I had seen a naked lady
on the side of the road.

14:51.534 --> 14:54.575
And she was really white and
I thought she was dead.

14:54.576 --> 14:56.668
Get in the car, I'll follow you.

14:56.669 --> 14:58.346
The officer told me...

14:58.347 --> 15:02.727
Take us there, but stay back 200 yards.

15:03.002 --> 15:07.907
We pulled out of the
parking lot and we drove.

15:07.908 --> 15:13.808
And then I said Nicki this is it
there's Bullion Bend up ahead.

15:16.157 --> 15:20.777
He had a big spotlight and he was looking.

15:27.353 --> 15:32.305
And then he came back
down and told me that uh,

15:32.306 --> 15:37.666
they hadn't found anything,
and that we should go home.

15:37.667 --> 15:40.986
I then told my husband that I
didn't think that they believed me.

15:40.987 --> 15:43.041
And that they thought I was crazy.

15:43.042 --> 15:47.542
And they probably just stopped the search.

15:48.505 --> 15:53.005
But I know that I saw her on that road.

16:02.988 --> 16:05.105
- Hey, guys.
- Hi. How's it going?

16:05.106 --> 16:06.406
Not bad.

16:06.407 --> 16:08.970
Later in the shift that night
I met up with the officers,

16:08.971 --> 16:11.134
that had gone up to the call
that Deborah Hoyt made.

16:11.135 --> 16:12.791
What's going on with Bullion Bend?

16:12.792 --> 16:16.554
We were speculating, I mean
maybe she's imagining it.

16:16.555 --> 16:18.196
Uh, maybe it's a practical joke.

16:18.197 --> 16:20.718
Okay so was she... Was she nuts? I mean...

16:20.719 --> 16:24.930
No, no, no. She was very convincing,
like she saw something.

16:24.931 --> 16:28.846
They believed her it wasn't like they
dismissed her as being a whack-job but...

16:28.847 --> 16:31.667
They believed her.

16:38.700 --> 16:44.600
We got in the house, and I just
laid on my bed and kept crying.

16:54.400 --> 16:57.976
I kept trying to go to sleep, but...

16:57.977 --> 17:00.696
She kept popping in my head.

17:00.697 --> 17:03.934
The vision of her just kept popping
in my head and when it did...

17:03.935 --> 17:07.295
I would wake up and cry.

17:23.194 --> 17:28.655
I got a call to go back to
the Sheriff's Department.

17:29.413 --> 17:32.464
I met with the aunt and
uncle of Christine Skubish.

17:32.465 --> 17:37.129
Who just spent all night driving up to
Placerville to from Southern California.

17:37.130 --> 17:39.073
Okay well we want to help, where can we go?

17:39.074 --> 17:41.251
They were concerned
obviously for Christine,

17:41.252 --> 17:43.487
and for Nicki because nobody
had seen or heard from them.

17:43.488 --> 17:46.768
And they indicated to me that they
wanted start their own search.

17:46.769 --> 17:49.602
Highway 50, okay we're gonna go there now.

17:49.603 --> 17:52.628
I recommended that they get some rest.
They were both very tired.

17:52.629 --> 17:57.909
Get some sleep and start
fresh when the sun is up.

17:58.461 --> 18:02.030
As I was talking to them I was
becoming more suspicious,

18:02.031 --> 18:05.974
that there could be some connection
between this naked woman...

18:05.975 --> 18:09.035
And Christine Skubish.

18:10.002 --> 18:13.277
I just had a sixth sense.

18:13.278 --> 18:19.178
I thought I'm going to go up in
to that area and search myself.

18:28.381 --> 18:33.481
I was desperate to find
her, along with my wife.

18:34.254 --> 18:40.154
As the time was ticking on we started
getting more and more worried.

18:40.649 --> 18:44.553
We knew that something had happened.

18:44.554 --> 18:47.914
But we didn't know what.

18:57.434 --> 19:03.334
As I drove up there, obviously the
sun is rising it's getting brighter.

19:04.305 --> 19:06.363
I approached the Bullion Bend area.

19:06.364 --> 19:08.558
This is the area that Deborah
Hoyt had told the officers,

19:08.559 --> 19:12.579
where she'd seen this naked woman.

19:13.781 --> 19:17.585
I was looking for anything
that was out of the ordinary.

19:17.586 --> 19:20.904
It could have been debris on the roadway
that ordinarily wouldn't be there.

19:20.905 --> 19:24.316
It could be skid marks off
the side of the road.

19:24.317 --> 19:27.349
Anything that isn't
ordinarily on the Highway.

19:27.350 --> 19:31.300
I was going to stop and investigate.

19:31.301 --> 19:37.201
Once I got in to the Bullion
Bend area I slowed my car down.

19:44.976 --> 19:50.876
I saw a small tennis shoe, like a
child's tennis shoe on the road.

19:51.750 --> 19:54.107
I'm thinking what are the odds
that this is Nicki's shoe.

19:54.108 --> 19:57.482
I mean this is exactly the
location that I had been told,

19:57.483 --> 20:03.123
Deborah Hoyt said she saw a
naked woman on the shoulder.

20:28.410 --> 20:34.310
I could look down and actually see
that this was a very steep drop off.

20:35.020 --> 20:38.699
And there was you know big pine
trees all intermingled there.

20:38.700 --> 20:44.107
And as I'm looking down I
started to see um, debris.

20:44.108 --> 20:47.948
That's when I saw the red car.

20:51.690 --> 20:55.839
The whole roof had been
peeled back on this car.

20:55.840 --> 21:01.740
And so the entire top part of the
car was missing, it was gone.

21:18.180 --> 21:23.520
I came around to see if
there was anybody in there.

21:32.450 --> 21:38.350
I realized at that point that this
in fact was Christine Skubish.

21:39.010 --> 21:43.690
I reached and I tried to feel for a pulse.

21:46.760 --> 21:48.578
At that point I knew the she...

21:48.579 --> 21:51.879
She had died. She was deceased.

21:51.880 --> 21:57.617
What bothered me the most about this
um, not seeing Christine like that.

21:57.618 --> 22:01.098
But looking across the car.

22:04.650 --> 22:08.130
That's what really got me.

22:09.210 --> 22:15.110
He had basically the look of death.
He didn't have any life, looking at him.

22:18.948 --> 22:24.848
I took my light, and I shined my light in
his eyes to see if there was any reaction.

22:33.110 --> 22:37.610
And I saw no reaction, no pupil change...

22:37.780 --> 22:39.798
I didn't feel a pulse.

22:39.799 --> 22:43.879
I believed that Niki too, was dead.

22:49.398 --> 22:53.586
And then I noticed that his chest, as
he's laying his chest rose a little bit.

22:53.587 --> 22:56.385
Like he took a breath.

22:56.386 --> 22:58.939
And I thought my mind was
playing tricks on me.

22:58.940 --> 23:02.287
I thought I was seeing things.

23:02.288 --> 23:08.188
And then I got down close and I could
actually feel shallow breaths.

23:08.345 --> 23:10.841
I said... "My God, he's alive."

23:10.842 --> 23:13.738
Nicki, stay with me.

23:13.739 --> 23:15.651
Immediately got on the radio.

23:15.652 --> 23:18.173
I need an EMT down here
as soon as possible!

23:18.174 --> 23:22.378
I tried to hold his hand, I said, Nicki,
if you can hear me, squeeze my hand.

23:22.379 --> 23:24.139
Stay with me.

23:24.140 --> 23:26.581
I tried to get him to interact with me.

23:26.582 --> 23:28.596
Um, I just continued to repeat his name.

23:28.597 --> 23:33.637
Stay with me.
I told him you're gonna be okay.

23:34.290 --> 23:39.429
Then other deputy's showed up and I
called them down to where I was.

23:39.430 --> 23:42.699
I told them who Nicki was and I said
you've gotta stay here with him.

23:42.700 --> 23:46.329
Um, you know I'm afraid
the family's coming.

23:46.330 --> 23:52.230
I didn't want them to see the
condition of Christine or Nicki.

23:53.909 --> 23:56.312
And sure enough Karen arrived.

23:56.313 --> 23:58.319
Stay back please. Nicki's okay.

23:58.320 --> 24:00.400
And I had to put up my hands and say, stop.

24:00.401 --> 24:02.706
- Stay back! Stay back!
- Christine!

24:02.707 --> 24:05.344
I kinda held Karen, and I looked
her in the face and I told her,

24:05.345 --> 24:08.872
car's down here, I found
both Christine and Nicki...

24:08.873 --> 24:11.450
Watch your step. Watch your step. Careful.

24:11.451 --> 24:15.411
Then I had to tell her, I said Christine
didn't make it Christine died...

24:15.412 --> 24:19.007
- No!
- It's okay. It's okay.

24:19.008 --> 24:23.815
- Oh my God, Christine!
- It's okay, it's going to be alright!

24:23.816 --> 24:26.756
But Nicki is alive.

24:30.379 --> 24:32.604
- Let's get you home buddy.
- Alright everybody ready?

24:32.605 --> 24:34.825
1,2,3...

24:35.310 --> 24:37.218
It's okay, Nicki!

24:37.219 --> 24:41.064
Let's get you home safe. Come on buddy.

24:41.065 --> 24:44.236
The firefighters, the paramedics,
they did all the treatments,

24:44.237 --> 24:47.151
the neck support everything, and
put him on a flat backboard,

24:47.152 --> 24:52.912
to get him out of there and
load him in to an ambulance.

24:54.390 --> 24:57.299
We got the phone call.

24:57.300 --> 25:00.720
They found Chris and Nick.

25:03.680 --> 25:08.463
And my wife kept saying...
Well how are they, are they okay?

25:08.464 --> 25:11.704
And I had to tell her.

25:19.522 --> 25:21.682
Brenda...

25:21.946 --> 25:24.526
Chris is dead.

25:27.049 --> 25:30.356
Earlier today, police responded
to a fatal accident car.

25:30.357 --> 25:33.570
My mother came to tell me I
needed see something on TV.

25:33.571 --> 25:38.381
23 year old Christine Skubish and his
son Nicki went missing 5 days ago.

25:38.382 --> 25:42.461
Their car was found in a ravine, Christine
was pronounced dead at the scene.

25:42.462 --> 25:46.717
I looked up, and saw the woman that
I had saw on the side of the road.

25:46.718 --> 25:51.176
Remarkably, Nicki survived for
five days without food or water.

25:51.177 --> 25:54.012
She had the same soft face.

25:54.013 --> 25:56.974
And if you could imagine her eyes closed...

25:56.975 --> 26:00.335
That would have been her.

26:01.827 --> 26:05.658
The woman that Deborah Hoyt saw,
could not be seen Christine Skubish.

26:05.659 --> 26:08.523
Because the night that
Deborah Hoyt saw this woman,

26:08.524 --> 26:13.744
Christine Skubish had already
been dead for 5 days.

26:39.805 --> 26:43.405
The Coroner's report indicated
that death was immediate.

26:43.406 --> 26:47.006
And that she died on impact.

26:47.114 --> 26:48.981
Christine Skubish never
took off her clothes.

26:48.982 --> 26:51.897
Never climbed up the hill, never
laid on the side of the road.

26:51.898 --> 26:55.762
Never went back down and got re-dressed
and put herself back in the the car.

26:55.763 --> 26:58.800
None of that happened.

26:58.801 --> 27:01.854
She was laying dead in that car for 5 days.

27:01.855 --> 27:07.755
Before Deborah Hoyt ever saw
anybody on the side of the road.

27:18.049 --> 27:21.389
When I walked in to the room,
um, I could see him there and,

27:21.390 --> 27:24.641
he was trying to hold his hands out.
Hi Papa.

27:24.642 --> 27:28.302
- Papa!
- Nicki, look at you!

27:28.750 --> 27:31.167
Man, he was pale.

27:31.168 --> 27:33.508
Uh, skinny.

27:33.733 --> 27:37.933
Uh, but he had a smile on his face.

27:38.190 --> 27:41.459
I walked over there and not
grabbed him hard or tight.

27:41.460 --> 27:46.020
But just held him as gently, like a baby.

27:51.600 --> 27:54.480
And it's like we were happy.

27:54.481 --> 28:00.381
Although we lost our daughter we were
happy that Nicki was still there.

28:01.670 --> 28:06.794
Roughly about seventeen years have
passed, since the accident happened.

28:06.795 --> 28:12.695
Uh, most things I do remember, there's
lots of flashes, mostly pictures.

28:13.064 --> 28:16.064
They are very vivid.

28:18.595 --> 28:24.399
The earliest ones I do remember being in
my grandparents' house with my mother.

28:24.400 --> 28:30.300
I remember them having a conversation, I
don't exactly know what it was about.

28:35.229 --> 28:37.887
That's about the earliest memory I have.

28:37.888 --> 28:43.788
Um, the closest memory that occurs after
that is of the accident its self.

28:47.400 --> 28:51.360
I remember tumbling down the hill.

28:52.043 --> 28:57.943
It was just tree, after tree, we
were just hitting them head on.

29:03.100 --> 29:09.000
I just remember waking up and being in
the passenger seat next to my mother.

29:10.480 --> 29:12.781
I remember not knowing what to think.

29:12.782 --> 29:15.889
Looking at my mom and just kind
of thinking she was asleep.

29:15.890 --> 29:18.975
I didn't think anything more than that.

29:18.976 --> 29:22.636
At least not that I remember.

29:29.902 --> 29:33.202
I remember seeing lights.

29:37.052 --> 29:39.359
But I just remember that something there,

29:39.360 --> 29:43.389
there was something right next to the
car the entire time next to my mom

29:43.390 --> 29:47.689
I have a very distinct and vivid
picture of it in my head.

29:47.690 --> 29:52.910
I mean, it was just a light,
it was a big light.

29:54.480 --> 29:56.957
And then through the back
window of the car itself,

29:56.958 --> 30:02.178
I could also see the same
thing next to the road.

30:05.962 --> 30:09.262
And it had a silhouette.

30:14.805 --> 30:20.705
There was no specific features but
I saw a lighted outline of a body.

30:26.480 --> 30:28.870
It was never something that scared me.

30:28.871 --> 30:33.371
And I didn't feel afraid when I saw it.

30:38.960 --> 30:44.860
Two weeks later, Brenda and I
decided to the crash site to see...

30:45.112 --> 30:51.012
If there was anything else that was left
down there behind that were Chris's.

30:51.600 --> 30:57.480
We wanted to make sure that we
got everything out of there.

30:58.688 --> 31:04.588
And as I got out of the car
there was a little mile marker.

31:05.504 --> 31:09.116
That said uh, 16 miles
pointing to Placerville.

31:09.117 --> 31:12.684
Then I knew that my sister didn't
have a dream, it was premonition.

31:12.685 --> 31:15.134
The number 16 kept popping up.

31:15.135 --> 31:21.035
And it all started making sense,
as I started adding the pieces.

31:21.055 --> 31:23.273
When you put all the pieces
of the puzzle together,

31:23.274 --> 31:27.474
you take the dream that my aunt had.

31:27.640 --> 31:31.056
The apparition sighting
that Deborah Hoyt did see.

31:31.057 --> 31:32.969
I just saw a dead woman
on the side of the road.

31:32.970 --> 31:38.010
And the lights that I did
see around the car...

31:38.289 --> 31:41.799
It had to have been an Angel.

31:41.800 --> 31:44.620
Whether it was God's hand or just...

31:44.621 --> 31:47.973
A mother looking after her
son I honestly don't know.

31:47.974 --> 31:51.503
But it was something, it was
something greater than me.

31:51.504 --> 31:56.664
And greater than anything
that I've ever believed.

31:57.589 --> 32:02.591
I absolutely think something
special happened here.

32:02.592 --> 32:05.291
People have asked before...
" Is this some kind of miracle?"

32:05.292 --> 32:07.225
Yeah, I think it is a miracle.

32:07.226 --> 32:11.560
It's a whole number of a series of
events that I can't explain and...

32:11.561 --> 32:17.461
I don't know I've often thought about
it, I just don't have the answers.

32:39.542 --> 32:43.040
I would come in to the heliport.

32:43.041 --> 32:46.821
And pre-flight the helicopter...

32:47.091 --> 32:50.081
The we would settle in and try to gauge.

32:50.082 --> 32:53.182
Listening to the police radio...

32:53.183 --> 32:56.603
Of how the day was going.

32:57.747 --> 33:02.299
I Was working with a new
crew member, Kenny Downs.

33:02.300 --> 33:06.454
He did not have any flight
experience and my job was...

33:06.455 --> 33:11.375
To kind of guide him,
and show him the ropes.

33:11.500 --> 33:13.907
I'd only been in the
unit a couple of weeks.

33:13.908 --> 33:17.914
So it was like having a brand new job.

33:17.915 --> 33:23.135
We noticed very quickly it
was a very quiet night.

33:28.475 --> 33:31.971
Around 10:30 or 11:00 that night.

33:31.972 --> 33:36.115
We decided that we should
take the helicopter up.

33:36.116 --> 33:39.536
And do our routine patrol.

33:39.540 --> 33:40.678
Make our presence known.

33:40.679 --> 33:43.229
Air one this is north-tower
you are cleared for take off.

33:43.230 --> 33:46.230
- Over.
- Copy that.

33:53.323 --> 33:56.623
Kenny and I were flying.

33:56.826 --> 33:58.775
Kenny was shining the light.

33:58.776 --> 34:01.152
Checking for anything that may be unusual.

34:01.153 --> 34:04.354
Checking roof tops of businesses.

34:04.355 --> 34:09.574
School grounds, and the
express ways and road ways.

34:17.027 --> 34:19.109
The radio was quiet.

34:19.110 --> 34:24.090
There wasn't a lot of
activity on the streets.

34:25.686 --> 34:29.803
There was virtually nothing in the sky.

34:29.804 --> 34:34.259
It was just a slow night
all the way around.

34:34.260 --> 34:37.559
So you wouldn't think that that night,

34:37.560 --> 34:43.460
would be a night that you'd
remember for the rest of your life.

35:02.578 --> 35:05.522
We had been flying for
45 minutes to an hour.

35:05.523 --> 35:09.013
Air one we have a burglary
in progress on Penile Road.

35:09.014 --> 35:10.314
Copy that.

35:10.315 --> 35:14.841
A call came out that there
was a burglary in progress.

35:14.842 --> 35:18.165
That's about 3 miles up north I believe.

35:18.166 --> 35:20.687
Then as we got nearer
which was only about...

35:20.688 --> 35:24.535
Um, a couple minutes, 3 minutes away...

35:24.536 --> 35:27.896
I saw a light flickering.

35:31.075 --> 35:34.271
The officer was shining his
flashlight turning it off and on.

35:34.272 --> 35:38.532
And I could tell where we were going.

35:42.087 --> 35:43.502
We were almost there.

35:43.503 --> 35:47.915
Be advised all personnel that is a false
alarm, that is a false alarm. Over.

35:47.916 --> 35:50.333
And they told us that it was a false alarm.

35:50.334 --> 35:51.896
Copy that.

35:51.897 --> 35:54.777
False alarm, Kenny.

35:57.004 --> 35:59.679
Air one, bring us around.
We'll head back to base if that's the case.

35:59.680 --> 36:04.576
We decided that we would just head
back to the heliport and take a break.

36:04.577 --> 36:06.463
T.C. This is air one...

36:06.464 --> 36:10.962
Uh, we are 4 miles southwest
of your current location.

36:10.963 --> 36:14.174
Roger that. Air one you are
clear to land on helipad 3.

36:14.175 --> 36:20.075
In route back to the heliport,
we went over a group of trees.

36:20.087 --> 36:25.987
We cleared this clump of trees,
and I saw something very unusual.

36:26.119 --> 36:28.499
- What's that?
- What's what?

36:28.500 --> 36:30.469
Look over to your left.

36:30.470 --> 36:36.370
I recall Kenny saying to me, Kenny
when did that tower get out there?

36:36.389 --> 36:40.086
And said tower, what tower?
"That tower with the light on it."

36:40.087 --> 36:41.781
There is no tower there.

36:41.782 --> 36:43.829
He said, "What are you talking about"?
I said that there.

36:43.830 --> 36:47.269
So I shined the light on it.

36:47.270 --> 36:51.950
And I looked over and saw a glowing object.

36:55.204 --> 36:57.045
And I said, what is that?

36:57.046 --> 36:59.782
That's definitely not a light on a tower.

36:59.783 --> 37:03.683
I got lower and a little closer.

37:07.867 --> 37:09.674
It was very bright.

37:09.675 --> 37:12.735
It had a pear shape.

37:14.519 --> 37:17.568
It just set there so we were kind
of facing off with each other.

37:17.569 --> 37:22.669
It was looking at us and
we were looking at it.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.199
I kept asking Kenny... What is this thing?

37:26.200 --> 37:28.199
Look at this!

37:28.200 --> 37:33.060
We just couldn't believe
what we were seeing.

37:34.434 --> 37:37.099
It started gaining altitude.

37:37.100 --> 37:40.940
Coming up to about our altitude.

37:41.120 --> 37:44.298
It stopped for a second,
it kinda looked at us.

37:44.299 --> 37:50.119
We kinda faced off and then it
started going to the right.

37:50.397 --> 37:53.517
And then to the left.

37:55.500 --> 37:57.378
It kinda hovered, like we were doing.

37:57.379 --> 38:01.199
So we kinda faced off with each other.

38:01.200 --> 38:06.127
And then all of a sudden it
just takes off a warp speed.

38:06.128 --> 38:11.408
And just goes like a mile
and a half in a second.

38:11.550 --> 38:16.996
As it disappeared from our sight it
had to be going 600 miles an hour.

38:16.997 --> 38:21.506
We just couldn't believe it.
What is this thing?

38:21.507 --> 38:26.127
It would leave and it would be right back.

38:33.398 --> 38:37.341
I saw a helicopter hovering
over the GE property.

38:37.342 --> 38:40.719
I could tell that it was
the police helicopter.

38:40.720 --> 38:43.837
What have you got going on over at GE?
I'm across the street in the park.

38:43.838 --> 38:46.363
I said guys, you all
need to come over here,

38:46.364 --> 38:52.004
we've got something chasing
us we're in GE parking lot.

38:55.464 --> 38:58.375
You know I moved on to the
property to get a better look.

38:58.376 --> 39:00.396
And you know I see the helicopter and then,

39:00.397 --> 39:05.857
off to one side I see kind
of a faint glowing light.

39:06.893 --> 39:10.689
We're seeing this orange glow up in the
sky here do you see what were seeing Joe?

39:10.690 --> 39:12.644
I see it all around you.

39:12.645 --> 39:15.145
You know I'm talking to Kenny on the radio.

39:15.146 --> 39:18.443
And uh, you know we're
basically asking him...

39:18.444 --> 39:23.448
Hey what is it guys, you know
what, what are you seeing?

39:23.449 --> 39:24.586
It's right behind us!

39:24.587 --> 39:29.147
I hear," Kenny, it's chasing us!
It's chasing us!"

39:29.148 --> 39:31.256
Air one, I have no idea what that is.

39:31.257 --> 39:34.018
I'm thinking, this thing is
going hit our tail rotor.

39:34.019 --> 39:37.031
It's coming from behind.

39:37.032 --> 39:39.972
I turned in to it.

39:40.331 --> 39:43.691
We're chasing after it...

39:44.042 --> 39:49.899
I was looking out my windshield.
I want to know what it is.

39:49.900 --> 39:53.790
The whole time you know I'm chasing
this object and everything.

39:53.791 --> 39:55.535
Things are flashing through my mind...

39:55.536 --> 40:00.366
Is it a plane, a balloon?
Some kind of aircraft?

40:00.367 --> 40:03.614
I can't keep my eye on it
because their moving...

40:03.615 --> 40:09.515
And I'm having to move to try to
keep up and get a closer look at it.

40:09.949 --> 40:12.800
I'm driving pretty fast.

40:12.801 --> 40:17.181
As I'm zigzagging through the buildings.

40:17.993 --> 40:23.893
It started getting farther and farther away
from me where I couldn't keep up with it.

40:25.425 --> 40:29.925
At the last moment... It was unbelievable.

40:31.208 --> 40:33.005
It's over... Right in front of us.

40:33.006 --> 40:35.088
What is this?

40:35.089 --> 40:37.265
Whoa! What the hell was that?

40:37.266 --> 40:42.666
Oh my God. All of a sudden
there come the fireballs.

40:50.416 --> 40:52.336
Whoa!

40:52.892 --> 40:56.633
That was the size of a baseball!
What the hell was that? Where did it go?

40:56.634 --> 41:01.418
As they fired out they stayed
equal distance to each other.

41:01.419 --> 41:03.472
- Look at that!
- It's another one.

41:03.473 --> 41:07.715
When they shot these fireballs out,
one never passed the other one.

41:07.716 --> 41:11.099
It was just... Right in line.

41:11.100 --> 41:16.017
At that same time, I'm banking
the helicopter hard to the left.

41:16.018 --> 41:21.585
And turning, because I didn't
want these objects to hit us.

41:21.586 --> 41:26.866
I see these faint fireballs
just kind of spurt out.

41:31.842 --> 41:36.739
By then I'm coming back up and
around to see where it went.

41:36.740 --> 41:38.669
And it was gone.

41:38.670 --> 41:41.214
- Okay. Kenny where did it go?
- I do not know.

41:41.215 --> 41:44.544
And we were saying where is?

41:44.545 --> 41:48.359
- Kenny you see anything?
- I don't see anything.

41:48.360 --> 41:52.440
There was nothing. It just vanished.

41:55.530 --> 42:01.430
We circled the area, and could
not find any trace of anything.

42:01.470 --> 42:07.370
Just as it appeared in the beginning,
it was gone in an instant.

42:08.819 --> 42:14.719
Once the unidentified flying object
disappeared, we decided to head in.

42:14.800 --> 42:18.880
There wasn't a lot of conversation.

42:23.590 --> 42:29.490
At that point, I'm just kind of
baffled you know what was it?

42:31.505 --> 42:36.425
We're trying to say that
this was not a UFO.

42:39.250 --> 42:42.490
And we couldn't do it.

42:44.710 --> 42:46.999
Do I believe in UFO's?

42:47.000 --> 42:49.280
Absolutely.

42:50.320 --> 42:55.049
I really don't know what it
was, and I can't explain it.

42:55.050 --> 42:57.608
But I did see a unidentified flying object.
