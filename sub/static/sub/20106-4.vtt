00:13.211 --> 00:15.212
So, uh, what are we doing?
Are we just...

00:15.214 --> 00:17.314
You do you not see
the phone to my ear?

00:17.316 --> 00:18.982
I... I do, but...
- What?

00:18.984 --> 00:21.385
I said, I... you think this
is some sort of joke?

00:21.387 --> 00:24.154
Maybe the one about the interrup...
Ting cow? - Moo!

00:24.156 --> 00:25.689
Shut up. Look, I...

00:25.691 --> 00:28.358
Listen, you had just
better put Mr. Vandertunt

00:28.360 --> 00:30.394
on the line this instant!

00:30.396 --> 00:32.963
Well, then, go find him.

00:32.965 --> 00:34.965
Oh. Well, then...

00:34.967 --> 00:36.900
hello? Ass!

00:36.902 --> 00:39.136
Apparently that was
your brother.

00:39.138 --> 00:40.504
What?
Cecil?

00:42.208 --> 00:43.974
Seriously.
And let me guess...

00:43.976 --> 00:45.909
he...
let me guess!

00:45.911 --> 00:48.545
He said he didn't believe that
I'd been kidnapped. Yes, he...

00:48.547 --> 00:50.480
has this happened before?

00:50.482 --> 00:52.716
No. I don't know.

00:52.718 --> 00:54.851
Well, he... hey, do you
need me for this?

00:54.853 --> 00:57.487
Yes! Because I've been awake
for, like, three days.

00:57.489 --> 01:00.824
Your point being?
I desperately need sleep?

01:00.826 --> 01:04.061
You can sleep when you're dead.
It may literally come to that.

01:04.063 --> 01:06.563
Because Len Trexler is
going to be left holding

01:06.565 --> 01:09.533
a very empty bag on this.

01:09.535 --> 01:10.934
And to make that happen,

01:10.936 --> 01:13.036
I need you to drive out
to Vandertunt castle

01:13.038 --> 01:15.672
and convince the old man
I'll mail her home

01:15.674 --> 01:17.908
in several different boxes.

01:17.910 --> 01:19.610
But not really,

01:19.612 --> 01:21.612
though, right?
Well...

01:21.614 --> 01:23.280
no!
Well...

01:23.282 --> 01:24.848
look...
I can't drive

01:24.850 --> 01:26.850
way the hell out there
without some sleep. I...

01:26.852 --> 01:28.252
I have Dexedrine.

01:28.254 --> 01:30.621
Ah, and the universe provides.

01:32.457 --> 01:35.058
Okay, so,
once I'm out there,

01:35.060 --> 01:37.194
how am I supposed to convince
Vandertunt you're serious?

01:37.196 --> 01:39.129
Take him a finger.

01:39.131 --> 01:41.965
Huh? But not one of
mine, though, right?

01:41.967 --> 01:43.400
No!
- Well...

01:43.402 --> 01:45.402
I'm not taking him
anybody's finger.

01:45.404 --> 01:47.638
I'm just trying to save you a trip.
- How...

01:47.640 --> 01:48.905
I mean, you don't want
to drive all the way

01:48.907 --> 01:50.440
out there just to have him say,

01:50.442 --> 01:52.643
"on second thought,
to make this happen,

01:52.645 --> 01:54.211
we're going to need a finger."

01:54.213 --> 01:55.812
Nobody has ever said,

01:55.814 --> 01:58.415
"to make this happen,
we're going to need a finger."

01:58.417 --> 02:01.251
Oh, you'd be surprised.

02:39.309 --> 02:40.943
<i>The last thing I wanted</i>

02:40.945 --> 02:43.011
<i>to get mixed up in
is a kidnapping,</i>

02:43.013 --> 02:45.247
<i>even one as phony
as a three-dollar bill.</i>

02:45.249 --> 02:48.317
Because doing a stretch in jail
would be the least of my worries.

02:48.319 --> 02:50.419
Vandertunts have enough juice
in this town to make sure

02:50.421 --> 02:52.955
I never even see
the inside of a cell.

02:52.957 --> 02:55.190
So I am not
looking forward to this.

02:55.192 --> 02:57.459
Plus I bet
that creepy old joint's

02:57.461 --> 02:59.294
as haunted
as Mrs. Muir's twat.

02:59.296 --> 03:01.363
Hmm!
I know, right?

03:01.365 --> 03:04.933
Oh, also, when I said I'd take
you to the bus station...

03:10.174 --> 03:11.640
<i>Typical Archer.</i>

03:11.642 --> 03:14.276
<i>Figures he'd be a goddamn slob.</i>

03:14.278 --> 03:17.112
Uh, I think maybe
somebody tossed the place?

03:17.114 --> 03:19.281
Oh. Yeah. Maybe.

03:19.283 --> 03:21.650
Wonder what they were after.

03:21.652 --> 03:24.453
Who knows? Maybe some poor
dumb bastard broke in here

03:24.455 --> 03:26.855
to steal back the photos
of his cheatin' wife gettin'...

03:26.857 --> 03:29.157
Sorry.

03:29.159 --> 03:31.026
Why... I was gonna say
"flap-hammered."

03:31.028 --> 03:33.395
Why do you constantly
bring that up?

03:33.397 --> 03:35.864
What, Archer hammering your wife?
Yes!

03:35.866 --> 03:37.499
In her flaps?
Yes!

03:37.501 --> 03:39.868
Okay.

03:39.870 --> 03:41.703
Well, we're not gonna
find any clues to lead us

03:41.705 --> 03:43.872
to Charlotte Vandertunt
in this dump, so let's...

03:43.874 --> 03:46.008
yeah. There's no telling
where she is.

03:46.010 --> 03:48.577
<i>And if we don't
know where she is?</i>

03:48.579 --> 03:51.179
It's... frustrating?

03:51.181 --> 03:53.682
No. Then nobody
knows where she is.

03:53.684 --> 03:56.585
Uh-huh.
Including her father!

03:56.587 --> 03:59.688
Yep. Which means we
can just tell him

03:59.690 --> 04:02.157
we kidnapped her,
collect the ransom ourselves,

04:02.159 --> 04:03.825
and then pay off Trexler!

04:03.827 --> 04:06.695
Ohh. Okay. Yeah.

04:06.697 --> 04:09.998
But on some level, it's
gotta be pretty frustrating.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.501
Not as frustrating as you!

04:12.503 --> 04:14.169
In the meantime,

04:14.171 --> 04:16.538
she was at dreamland
with Archer the other night.

04:16.540 --> 04:19.541
So go snoop around,
see if you turn up anything.

04:19.543 --> 04:23.045
Besides a cold Brewski, am I right?
Hello?

04:23.047 --> 04:25.213
Yes, Vandertunt castle, please.

04:25.215 --> 04:27.215
Damn it, I don't care
if the number's unlisted!

04:27.217 --> 04:29.618
This is a police emergency!

04:29.620 --> 04:30.886
Thank you.

04:30.888 --> 04:34.089
That worked?
Why are you still here?

04:34.091 --> 04:36.091
Yes, hello.
This is, uh...

04:36.093 --> 04:38.860
Uh, ze kidnapperz.

04:40.763 --> 04:43.365
Please hold the wire.

04:48.938 --> 04:50.305
I apologize for the heat.

04:50.307 --> 04:52.874
It's positively tropical
in here.

04:52.876 --> 04:55.143
But that's how father
prefers it.

04:55.145 --> 04:56.945
Can he hear us?

04:56.947 --> 04:58.947
Oh, yes.
He's just being rude.

04:58.949 --> 05:01.650
Father, say hello
to Charlotte's kidnapper.

05:01.652 --> 05:03.785
No, no...
I-i-i didn't kidnap her.

05:03.787 --> 05:05.420
I'm just sort of
a go-between.

05:05.422 --> 05:07.756
A fine distinction,
legally speaking.

05:07.758 --> 05:09.491
I know, but look,
I'm just trying to make sure

05:09.493 --> 05:10.659
she gets home safely.

05:10.661 --> 05:13.095
In exchange
for one million dollars.

05:13.097 --> 05:15.731
According to the person,
or persons,

05:15.733 --> 05:17.332
who asked me to
deliver the message.

05:17.334 --> 05:19.334
Whom I'm sure
she's boring senseless

05:19.336 --> 05:21.970
with her constant raving
about incest.

05:21.972 --> 05:24.740
Uh, I wouldn't know about that.
Oh, it's when, uh...

05:24.742 --> 05:28.076
- I know what it is.
- Did you know it's forbidden?

05:28.078 --> 05:29.444
Everybody knows it's forbidden.

05:29.446 --> 05:31.446
Oh, you'd be surpri...
yes, Pelham?

05:31.448 --> 05:33.849
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

05:33.851 --> 05:36.985
Ohh. Mm-hmm!

05:36.987 --> 05:39.621
Yes, I think a finger
should suffice.

05:39.623 --> 05:41.156
Oh, is he taking drink orders?

05:41.158 --> 05:44.292
'Cause I could go for a couple
of fingers of old buncombe.

05:44.294 --> 05:47.996
Like, a whole handful. - At 7:00
A.M., you care for bourbon.

05:47.998 --> 05:49.665
Deeply.
- Very well.

05:49.667 --> 05:53.935
Finish your call, Pelham, and
then Mr. Archer needs a drink.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.504
I hate to say "need."

05:55.506 --> 05:56.938
Well...
- Yeah.

05:56.940 --> 06:00.108
Pelham has had the most
interesting telephone call.

06:00.110 --> 06:02.944
Tell me, Mr. Archer,
does, or do,

06:02.946 --> 06:07.182
your person, or persons, possess
an accent vaguely Germanic?

06:07.184 --> 06:10.352
That's pretty confusing, but no.

06:10.354 --> 06:13.288
Most confusing, yes,
because such a person

06:13.290 --> 06:14.956
is on the telephone just now,

06:14.958 --> 06:16.892
<i>claiming that he
is the kidnapper.</i>

06:16.894 --> 06:20.362
"He"? I mean, what?
Th-that's impossible.

06:20.364 --> 06:22.497
Yes, even Charlotte
isn't stupid enough

06:22.499 --> 06:25.634
to get herself kidnapped by two
different kidnappers at once.

06:25.636 --> 06:28.970
Well... which means
one of you is lying.

06:28.972 --> 06:31.573
So I'm afraid I shall
have to ask for proof

06:31.575 --> 06:33.041
you actually have Charlotte.

06:33.043 --> 06:36.011
What kind of... wait.
Oh, no.

06:36.013 --> 06:39.514
Yes. I'm afraid
I require... a finger.

06:39.516 --> 06:40.982
I-I could bring you her.

06:40.984 --> 06:43.418
Just drive by the house.
She can wave to you.

06:43.420 --> 06:47.155
Mmmmmmmmmmm, no.

06:47.157 --> 06:48.690
I... that's...

06:48.692 --> 06:51.760
then how about a photo of her
holding today's newspaper?

06:51.762 --> 06:55.330
Mmmm, well, now, that could work.
Yeah, it's...

06:55.332 --> 06:57.399
just make sure that she's
holding the newspaper

06:57.401 --> 06:59.067
with nine fingers.

06:59.069 --> 07:00.902
Aw, goddamn it.

07:00.904 --> 07:02.904
Well, actually seven.
What?

07:02.906 --> 07:04.906
You know,
not counting her thumbs.

07:04.908 --> 07:07.442
And then, obviously,
bring me her severed finger

07:07.444 --> 07:09.511
and the photograph
so that I may compare the two.

07:09.513 --> 07:12.781
Yeah. Um, obviously.

07:12.783 --> 07:15.884
Father, say good-bye to
Charlotte's ostensible kidnapper!

07:15.886 --> 07:18.854
So I guess that's
a no on the bourbon?

07:18.856 --> 07:21.690
Yes. Good-bye.

07:21.692 --> 07:25.227
Where the hell am I
supposed to find a finger?

07:25.229 --> 07:28.196
Hello? Hello?

07:28.198 --> 07:31.133
Hey, listen to me.
Whoever you are,

07:31.135 --> 07:35.437
and whatever this whole thing
is, I don't want it.

07:35.439 --> 07:37.205
Well, I'm very sorry
to hear that.

07:37.207 --> 07:40.208
Well, too bad, because...
- Because you're getting it,

07:40.210 --> 07:43.612
whether you want it or not.

07:46.099 --> 07:48.167
So, let's get to it, shall we?

07:48.169 --> 07:50.035
No. Look... look, listen.

07:50.037 --> 07:51.703
I didn't know, okay?

07:51.705 --> 07:52.938
I thought
this was gonna be, like,

07:52.940 --> 07:56.275
some pull-on fake feet, man,
not... not...

07:56.277 --> 07:58.410
oh, sweet Jesus lord god Christ,

07:58.412 --> 08:01.246
not some freaky metal
robot legs!

08:01.248 --> 08:04.083
That'll do, schnuckiputzi.

08:04.085 --> 08:07.186
And also,
it's not just the legs.

08:07.188 --> 08:08.787
No, you crazy kraut bastard,

08:08.789 --> 08:10.789
I don't want any part
of those parts!

08:10.791 --> 08:13.926
But your employer, Mr. Trexler, does.
It's not his body!

08:13.928 --> 08:15.694
Look, I'm just following orders.

08:15.696 --> 08:18.464
What? That's what
the Nazis said!

08:18.466 --> 08:21.033
<i>Okay, yeah, tell me about Nazis.</i>

08:24.205 --> 08:26.171
What is taking so long?

08:56.337 --> 08:58.170
I said, that will do!

09:02.610 --> 09:04.076
Mmm.

09:05.845 --> 09:07.846
Mmm. What a load of shit.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.648
I should be looking
for my partner's killer,

09:09.650 --> 09:12.751
but instead I'm looking
for a damn finger.

10:04.871 --> 10:06.972
Well,

10:06.974 --> 10:10.042
I hate to say I told you so.
Do you?

10:10.044 --> 10:12.644
No. It's one of the few
great pleasures in life.

10:12.646 --> 10:15.914
Hang on. Do you live in here?
No, you ass!

10:15.916 --> 10:18.750
I live in the ten-room
penthouse apartment upstairs.

10:18.752 --> 10:20.252
Oh.
You don't happen to have

10:20.254 --> 10:22.221
a bunch of surplus fingers
up there, do ya?

10:22.223 --> 10:24.223
What do you think?
Honestly?

10:24.225 --> 10:26.258
Hardy-har-har.

10:26.260 --> 10:28.493
If you need a finger,
just take one.

10:28.495 --> 10:30.429
But... no, I'm not
cutting off her...

10:32.166 --> 10:34.766
Man, that septum
is deviated, huh?

10:34.768 --> 10:36.568
That's not her.

10:36.570 --> 10:39.071
Poovey?
Mm-hmm.

10:39.073 --> 10:41.240
Tried to break into the club
first thing this morning.

10:41.242 --> 10:44.843
I assume looking for
drooling beauty over there.

10:44.845 --> 10:48.013
Yeah, you really threw a monkey
wrench into Figgis' plan.

10:48.015 --> 10:50.249
His plan?
Yeah, to ransom her off.

10:50.251 --> 10:52.517
Why?
Wh... to pay back Trexler.

10:52.519 --> 10:53.585
For what?
What are you...

10:53.587 --> 10:56.088
for the sex slaves
Trexler was gonna...

10:56.090 --> 10:57.723
oh, I get it!

10:57.725 --> 11:00.125
Do you? You're saying
this is all my fault.

11:00.127 --> 11:03.095
Isn't it? I... look, this
whole fiasco started

11:03.097 --> 11:05.030
because I came to you for help!

11:05.032 --> 11:07.299
Exactly.
Whose fault is that?

11:07.301 --> 11:09.134
Son of a... that is so...

11:09.136 --> 11:11.370
so now I gotta go
find a goddamn finger?

11:11.372 --> 11:15.307
And if I were you, I'd take one
of her rings to put on it.

11:15.309 --> 11:17.209
They say the devil's
in the details.

11:17.211 --> 11:18.810
And silk pajamas.
What?

11:18.812 --> 11:20.579
Get up, you lummox!
Huh?

11:20.581 --> 11:23.215
Wuzza... what the...
Archer?

11:23.217 --> 11:24.983
Get up, dummy.
We gotta go.

11:24.985 --> 11:27.586
You better pray to god
it wasn't you who hit me,

11:27.588 --> 11:29.755
because whoever it was...

11:29.757 --> 11:33.158
Hits like a weak
little bitch of a girl,

11:33.160 --> 11:36.428
who was born with some kind of
little bitch of a birth defect,

11:36.430 --> 11:38.096
so that instead of a fist,

11:38.098 --> 11:41.900
she just has this tiny
little bitch of a...

11:41.902 --> 11:44.169
Nubbin.

11:44.171 --> 11:48.106
And I guess I'll drive, since
you clearly have a concussion.

11:48.108 --> 11:50.175
Yeah, not feeling great.

11:55.282 --> 11:56.682
Ahh.

11:56.684 --> 11:58.250
You know you're
killing me, right?

11:58.252 --> 11:59.785
Sorry, are you talking to me,

11:59.787 --> 12:02.087
or just meat-stuffed
intestines in general?

12:02.089 --> 12:04.122
Figgis is counting
on that ransom money.

12:04.124 --> 12:06.658
I can't double-cross him again.
Why not?

12:06.660 --> 12:07.859
Because if he finds out,

12:07.861 --> 12:09.961
somebody's gonna find me
in a hole in the desert.

12:09.963 --> 12:13.131
No, they're not.
Exactly!

12:13.133 --> 12:14.833
Look, it's your own fault
for doing right

12:14.835 --> 12:16.268
by all those Chinese broads.

12:16.270 --> 12:19.438
Pfft! Talk about no good deed.
It was a good deed.

12:19.440 --> 12:22.040
And now I need you to help me
do another good deed.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.942
Defraud an old man
out of a million dollars

12:23.944 --> 12:25.544
using a severed human finger.

12:25.546 --> 12:27.379
And reunite a family.

12:27.381 --> 12:29.214
Of daughter
and sister-bangers.

12:29.216 --> 12:31.316
<i>Alleged daughter
and sister-bangers.</i>

12:33.053 --> 12:36.888
Well, let's go to the morgue.

12:36.890 --> 12:39.024
That's the spirit.

12:41.395 --> 12:43.995
Excuse me?

12:43.997 --> 12:45.731
I said,
I'm looking for a corpse.

12:45.733 --> 12:48.567
White, female, mid-30s,
fresh,

12:48.569 --> 12:50.569
within, say, the last 12 hours.

12:50.571 --> 12:52.738
Jesus Christ, every full moon.

12:52.740 --> 12:54.840
Beat it, ya sicko,
before I call the cops.

12:54.842 --> 12:58.176
I am the cops, asshole!
I'm working a missing persons!

12:58.178 --> 13:00.178
Well, maybe lead with that, huh?

13:00.180 --> 13:02.414
Just buzz me in, ya hump.

13:04.851 --> 13:07.319
Jesus Christ.

13:07.321 --> 13:10.088
What is it, national hot dog day?
No.

13:10.090 --> 13:12.023
There isn't one.
Yet!

13:12.025 --> 13:15.260
Can you... Oh, right. LAPD.
We're looking for a...

13:15.262 --> 13:17.262
missing persons, yeah.
White female, 30s,

13:17.264 --> 13:18.663
brand-newly deceased.

13:18.665 --> 13:20.332
Your jerk-off partner's
already back there.

13:20.334 --> 13:21.500
Our what?

13:21.502 --> 13:24.336
Eyeglasses, dark hair,
gray at the temples,

13:24.338 --> 13:25.937
mouth like somebody
used a tomato capper

13:25.939 --> 13:28.774
to scoop out a pig's asshole
and glued it under his nose?

13:28.776 --> 13:31.009
Aw, shit!

13:33.379 --> 13:34.780
Are you nuts?

13:34.782 --> 13:37.549
Do you wanna get caught?
We're not gonna get caught.

13:37.551 --> 13:40.285
Now shut up, put these on,
and follow my lead.

13:40.287 --> 13:43.355
Aw, jeez.
He's really doing it.

13:43.357 --> 13:45.690
Sorry, lady.

13:45.692 --> 13:48.260
But if you think about it,
which I guess you can't,

13:48.262 --> 13:52.030
this whole thing
is Archer's fault, so...

13:52.032 --> 13:54.599
Will you get in position?!

13:54.601 --> 13:56.902
Okay! Jesus!

13:56.904 --> 13:59.204
Okay. Jesus.

13:59.206 --> 14:01.606
On one, two...

14:01.608 --> 14:03.442
Ohhhh...

14:05.646 --> 14:07.145
Great Scott!
Wha...

14:07.147 --> 14:09.281
don't you move, you sick bugger!

14:09.283 --> 14:11.917
No... no, no... this...
this isn't... I-i can explain.

14:11.919 --> 14:14.486
You're damn right you will...
to the bobbies!

14:14.488 --> 14:16.488
By which I mean the police!

14:16.490 --> 14:18.890
<i>I am the police.</i>

14:18.892 --> 14:19.925
Well?

14:19.927 --> 14:21.593
Well, whaaa...

14:21.595 --> 14:24.296
holy shit!
I can't believe I did that!

14:24.298 --> 14:26.765
I can't believe
it took you so damn long.

14:26.767 --> 14:28.633
What, are you hourly?
Pfft!

14:28.635 --> 14:29.901
No.
Wh...

14:29.903 --> 14:31.903
where the hell did you get that?

14:31.905 --> 14:33.772
It was just sitting there.

14:33.774 --> 14:36.274
That could've been
inside somebody.

14:40.914 --> 14:42.747
Well, it is now.

14:45.488 --> 14:47.790
Anything.
Whatever. A little box.

14:47.792 --> 14:49.658
Aren't we supposed
to put it in milk?

14:49.660 --> 14:51.861
But... that's for a tooth, dummy,

14:51.863 --> 14:54.230
<i>if you're gonna put it
back in somebody.</i>

14:54.232 --> 14:56.365
Yeah, that makes more sense.

14:56.367 --> 14:57.900
Now, what are we gonna
do about him?

14:57.902 --> 15:00.569
I actually have
some thoughts on that.

15:01.805 --> 15:03.339
He'll freeze to death in there!

15:03.341 --> 15:06.075
No, he won't. I'll call them in,
like, half an hour.

15:06.077 --> 15:08.010
Oh. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What?

15:08.012 --> 15:10.980
Strip him.

15:13.817 --> 15:16.218
Really wish we hadn't
have done that.

15:16.220 --> 15:18.487
I can never unsee him naked.

15:18.489 --> 15:20.856
I mean, the size of that thing.

15:20.858 --> 15:22.358
Hollow that big bastard out,

15:22.360 --> 15:24.026
you could use it
for an umbrella stand.

15:24.028 --> 15:25.628
Ugh!

15:27.030 --> 15:29.999
Goddamn it!
What?

15:30.001 --> 15:32.268
Oh, I suppose
I'm just surprised.

15:32.270 --> 15:34.169
Why? You said
you wanted her finger,

15:34.171 --> 15:36.372
so, you know, here's her finger.

15:36.374 --> 15:39.074
It's really in there?
See for yourself.

15:39.076 --> 15:42.244
Mmmmmmmmmm, no.

15:42.246 --> 15:43.679
I'm sorry?

15:43.681 --> 15:45.915
I trust you. Unless...
What?

15:45.917 --> 15:47.850
Father, do you wanna see

15:47.852 --> 15:50.786
Charlotte's ostensible
severed finger?

15:50.788 --> 15:52.021
No. We're good.

15:52.023 --> 15:54.056
Are you...
this could be anything!

15:54.058 --> 15:55.591
It could be a piece
of a hot dog!

15:55.593 --> 15:57.293
Eww!
Don't you start!

15:57.295 --> 15:59.728
You say it's her finger,
I take you at your word.

15:59.730 --> 16:01.630
And I assume
you'll be in touch shortly

16:01.632 --> 16:03.299
with complicated instructions

16:03.301 --> 16:05.634
for the exchange of the ransom
money for my horrible sister?

16:05.636 --> 16:07.436
I mean...

16:07.438 --> 16:09.204
<i>Good.</i>

16:09.206 --> 16:11.974
Then it's all settled.
Yeah. Uh, I guess.

16:11.976 --> 16:15.577
I'll expect the ransom within 24
hours, so you'll see to that.

16:15.579 --> 16:17.279
But... and then you're
gonna help me find

16:17.281 --> 16:18.480
my partner's killer, right?

16:18.482 --> 16:21.116
All in good time,
Mr. Archer.

16:21.118 --> 16:22.985
Right.

16:24.255 --> 16:26.956
Is it just me...

16:26.958 --> 16:28.891
Or does it smell like finger?

16:30.661 --> 16:33.729
Almost there.

16:33.731 --> 16:36.398
So close.

17:02.025 --> 17:03.025
Oh!

20:03.007 --> 20:04.673
Tu-Tu.

20:07.611 --> 20:09.845
Yeah, you're just a widdle whore

20:09.847 --> 20:11.847
for the cuddles, huh?

20:11.849 --> 20:13.849
Okay, I gotta get some sleep.

20:13.851 --> 20:16.685
You be a good girl.
Who's a good girl?

20:16.687 --> 20:19.521
Yeah, you're a good girl.
