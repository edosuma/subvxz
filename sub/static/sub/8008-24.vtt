Can I please save after this battle?

it's my business to tell you.

Don't you dare, Shelby!
Give up that greasy gossip!

02:03.248 --> 02:07.628

Finn's been hangin' with a new lady.

02:08.794 --> 02:11.173
Who the honk is it?

02:11.298 --> 02:13.141
- I don't...
- Muscle Princess. It's perfect.

02:13.425 --> 02:14.927
- I don't...
- Me-Mow, from the future!

02:15.135 --> 02:16.512
- (GASPS)
- Nobody knows.

02:16.928 --> 02:19.431
Finn's been keeping this on the super DL.

02:19.556 --> 02:22.059
- Why?
- He's just trying to be careful this time.

02:22.643 --> 02:23.815
Oh, yeah, I get it.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.942
But, I still got to know who this girl is.

02:26.021 --> 02:27.443
Okay, just don't blow up his spot.

02:28.315 --> 02:29.316
JAKE: I won't!

02:29.691 --> 02:30.692
Ooh! Ohhh!

- Hey, Jake.
- Oh, hey, Science Cat.

02:34.029 --> 02:35.076
Where's Sword Shark?

02:35.322 --> 02:36.448
He died of old age.

Hey, are you gonna find out
who Finn's girlfriend is?

02:39.576 --> 02:40.668
Who told you that?

02:40.952 --> 02:42.329
Word gets around, man.

02:42.579 --> 02:44.081
Not to me, apparently.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.837
Let me know the dirt when you find out.

02:45.832 --> 02:46.833

03:17.364 --> 03:19.207
Oh, hi, Jake. What are you doing here?

03:19.491 --> 03:21.493
I wanted to check out your new lady friend,

03:21.743 --> 03:25.088
but I guess she just dumped you
like a diaper in the dirt, bro.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.959
(CRYING) I'm sorry, man.

03:28.250 --> 03:32.005
I want you to have a healthy relationship

03:32.462 --> 03:34.885
That's so sweet, Jake. I love you, man.

03:35.006 --> 03:36.132
Me, too, man.

03:36.758 --> 03:37.759
Okay. I'm okay.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.220
But, dude, me and Huntress Wizard
weren't together.

03:40.637 --> 03:43.390
We're just trying to conjure up
the Spirit of the Forest with my flute spell.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.646
What the blood are you talking about?

03:46.017 --> 03:47.269
It went down like this.

03:59.030 --> 04:01.032
- Hello.
- How are you playing like that?

04:01.616 --> 04:03.289
I don't know. I'm just making stuff up.

04:03.744 --> 04:07.669
Something in your notes has the quality
of a powerful evocation spell.

04:08.123 --> 04:09.545
What spirit guides your hands?

04:10.167 --> 04:11.760
Tell me, or I'll put this up your nose.

04:12.043 --> 04:13.670
First off, I'm a great fighter.

04:14.045 --> 04:16.264
And I'm especially agile
when I'm nude, so good luck.

04:16.757 --> 04:19.135
Second, my flute improv ain't no secret.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.478
I let my grass hand do whatever it wants,

04:21.970 --> 04:23.722
which is usually sort of shreddy and busy.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.607
Let me see that hand.

04:27.642 --> 04:29.235
You're what I've been looking for.

04:30.020 --> 04:32.022
Lookin' for a dope boyfriend.

04:32.397 --> 04:34.274
No, man,
she thinks my grass arm flute playing

04:34.357 --> 04:35.904
could summon the Spirit of the Forest.

04:36.151 --> 04:39.280
I've been playing different songs for two
weeks, though, and he hasn't shown up yet.

04:39.404 --> 04:40.906
Who's that, her ex-boyfriend?

04:41.364 --> 04:43.162
Uh, I guess they used to hang out

04:43.241 --> 04:46.290
but maybe in some kind
of mentor-student capacity.

04:46.661 --> 04:49.380
So my theory holds.
You can still make this happen.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.918
Yeah, I really want to help
her summon this dude.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.422
Finn, that's not why you're here.

04:53.752 --> 04:54.924
That's why I'm here.

04:55.045 --> 04:56.638
Come on, let's make some magic happen.

04:57.047 --> 04:58.549
Yeah, my magic flute spell.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.055
(GROANS)

05:04.304 --> 05:05.271
- HUNTRESS WIZARD: Finn.
- (BOTH SCREAM)

05:05.430 --> 05:06.431
I had an idea.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.062
Hi.

05:08.058 --> 05:09.810
I think the problem is your flute.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.438
We should make you a better
one from a magical tusk.

05:12.938 --> 05:15.566
Like the tusk of the legendary Thunder Boar
that lives in these woods.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.321
I'm down for whatever if it helps.

05:17.776 --> 05:18.823
I'm also here.

05:19.194 --> 05:20.195
Hey, what's up?

05:21.071 --> 05:23.699
It's late. Why don't you guys
crash at my place tonight?

05:23.949 --> 05:25.326
We'll start the hunt first thing in the morning.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.170
Ha-ha! I'm like your sleepover chaperone.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.331
- Grow up.
- You grow up, you teen!

05:37.546 --> 05:39.469
So, yeah, here's the place.

05:39.714 --> 05:42.092
We got some nice soft dirt right over here.

05:42.217 --> 05:44.720
Pantry, in case you want a snack, bathroom.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.722
I got a console if you get bored,

05:46.972 --> 05:48.974
but it was a gift,
so I haven't really set it up yet.

05:49.599 --> 05:50.691
Night, boys.

05:59.109 --> 06:00.486
(SNORES)

06:01.486 --> 06:02.988
JAKE: Dude, I think I figured it out.

06:03.363 --> 06:06.867
You can't summon the Spirit of the Forest
'cause you ain't playing that flute for him.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.747
You got a crush on HW.

06:08.994 --> 06:11.622
HW's just training me to live
an ascetic life like her.

06:11.746 --> 06:14.249
Mmm, okay, I buy that for like zero seconds.

06:24.259 --> 06:27.763
Before we hunt the Thunder Boar,
you should drink from this enchanted spring.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.140
It might give you crazy dreams,

06:30.265 --> 06:33.360
but when you wake up, you'll be immune
to the Boar's electrical attacks.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.650
Let's roll those dice. (GULPING)

06:36.021 --> 06:37.773
Hey, dude, are you sure you want to do that?

06:37.772 --> 06:39.115
Mm-hmm. Blah!

06:39.524 --> 06:42.027
I've had plenty of weird dreams... Okay!

06:42.277 --> 06:43.403
That was fast. (CHIRPS)

06:47.657 --> 06:50.410
Welcome. I am the Spirit of the Forest.

06:52.162 --> 06:54.915
Wow, dude, we've been trying
to summon you for weeks.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.417
And why do you seek me?

06:56.791 --> 06:58.543
I don't, personally,

06:58.543 --> 07:00.796
but Huntress Wizard really wants
to talk to you, man.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.891
Did you know that a wolf's eyes
are on the front of its head?

07:04.257 --> 07:05.884
But, yeah, didn't you guys used to hang?

07:06.176 --> 07:08.270
Most predatory species are like that.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.271
This little buddy doesn't even know I'm here.

07:10.639 --> 07:12.767
Fella, I don't want to have
a science talk right now.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.527
Huntress Wizard only sees straight ahead.

07:15.894 --> 07:17.020
Eyes on the prize.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.189
Now, why did you really need to see me?

07:19.439 --> 07:22.158
Oh, yeah!
Can you make me immune to electricity?

07:22.442 --> 07:23.785
- Here.
- Whoa.

07:24.069 --> 07:25.696
Now plunge that into your heart.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.949
And this'll give me immunity to electricity?

07:30.951 --> 07:33.204
I'll do it. To help Huntress Wizard.

07:35.538 --> 07:36.585
(YELLS)

07:36.957 --> 07:37.958
How long was I out?

07:38.083 --> 07:39.801
Seven long, harrowing seconds.

07:40.085 --> 07:41.086
Hold still.

07:41.586 --> 07:42.587
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLES)

07:42.796 --> 07:44.719
- FINN: Yeah, feels fine.
- Great.

07:45.048 --> 07:46.595
Now we can hunt down the Thunder Boar.

07:47.092 --> 07:48.218
Oh, yeah, the Boar.

07:48.843 --> 07:49.935
Try to stay focused.

07:52.597 --> 07:54.440
Magic dog, what do you smell?

07:54.557 --> 07:55.604
(SNIFFS)

07:55.725 --> 07:58.945
Mostly, Finn but also some
kind of giant wild pig.

07:59.104 --> 08:00.105
There!

08:02.565 --> 08:03.612
(GRUNTS)

08:05.110 --> 08:06.111
(SQUEALING)

08:07.112 --> 08:08.739

Hey!

08:22.836 --> 08:23.837
Good work.

08:24.212 --> 08:25.634
You just wanted a tusk?

08:26.506 --> 08:28.634
- You could have asked!
- Oh.

08:34.264 --> 08:35.311
(INHALES SHARPLY)

08:35.306 --> 08:36.899
(FLUTE PLAYING)

08:46.776 --> 08:48.073
You can stop.

08:48.778 --> 08:49.825
He is not coming.

08:50.321 --> 08:52.949
He's gone for good, and I should just deal.

08:53.283 --> 08:56.082
Maybe if I played it a little jazzier,
like, all syncopated?

08:56.161 --> 08:58.584
Hey! Why don't you two try playing together?

08:58.830 --> 09:00.548
Use that chemistry to guide the music.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.964
Yeah, just get in there. Cozy up.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.337
I guess we've tried everything else.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.964
(FLUTES PLAYING)

09:12.052 --> 09:13.224
Wow!

09:14.304 --> 09:15.476
What?

09:16.973 --> 09:19.351
Who summons me with the sweet song
of longing?

09:20.101 --> 09:22.069
Oh, hey-oh. Can you see me now?

09:22.479 --> 09:24.231
- Yes.
- SPIRIT: How's it been going?

09:24.731 --> 09:26.074
I've been talking to a lot of twigs.

09:26.608 --> 09:28.861
- Where have you been, dude?
- I've been right here.

09:29.360 --> 09:32.239
But the forces that drew us close
became obscured

09:32.238 --> 09:35.242
as you drifted into the
lifestyles of magic city livin'.

09:35.825 --> 09:38.704
Attracting forces come and go.
It's the way of the world.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.122
I still can't tell if you guys dated.

09:41.498 --> 09:43.125
But I'm ready to come back now.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.377
- Are you, though?
- That's what I'm saying.

09:45.877 --> 09:47.879
Finn, who was your flute spell for?

09:49.589 --> 09:50.511
Um...

09:51.883 --> 09:53.760
I was playing my flute for you the whole time,

09:54.385 --> 09:57.389
but I knew you had a thing with this dude,
and he seems cool,

09:58.014 --> 10:00.142
so I was just gonna keep playing
this flute song

10:00.266 --> 10:02.360
about my secret feelings until my flute broke.

10:03.228 --> 10:07.153
I, uh, I worry that hard meat don't get eat.

10:07.482 --> 10:10.031
That is to say,
if I ever find what I'm looking for,

10:10.110 --> 10:12.738
I'll become soft and I'll cease
to matter in this world.

10:12.862 --> 10:13.909
What?

10:13.905 --> 10:17.284
Fear of softness is what drove me
to the mad and sad world of wizarding.

10:18.034 --> 10:19.752
- Ancl, Finn...
- Yeah? What?

10:21.121 --> 10:22.418
(GASPS)

10:23.498 --> 10:25.421
My flute spell was for you, too.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.544
You're an exceptional beast,
and you have great hair.

10:28.128 --> 10:31.052
But exceptional beasts
like us cannot fall in love.

10:31.422 --> 10:33.390
That is the secret of ordinary people.

10:33.758 --> 10:35.180
Uh, that's real dumb.

10:35.677 --> 10:36.678
I agree.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.396
Wait, you agree with me or her?

10:41.057 --> 10:42.183
Take it easy, Huntress Wizard.

10:44.435 --> 10:47.564
FINN: Man, I can't believe all you can do
is upgrade your armor in this game.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.316
It's all about patience

10:49.315 --> 10:53.821
and treating each grueling,
repetitive battle as if it were your first.

10:54.445 --> 10:55.537
FINN: Oh, snap!

10:56.573 --> 10:57.574
Finally!

10:57.824 --> 10:58.950
BOTH: Whoo!

10:59.075 --> 11:00.201
BOTH: Blah!

11:00.201 --> 11:03.080
What a bad and boring game.
It was just what I needed.

11:03.413 --> 11:05.541
I'm sorry it didn't work out
with Huntress Wizard.

11:05.790 --> 11:08.168
She just needs time to miss how cool you are.

11:08.585 --> 11:10.212
Attracting forces come and go, man.

11:11.462 --> 11:12.463
(SINGLE NOTE PLAYS)

11:14.841 --> 11:17.845
<i>Come along with me</i>

11:18.970 --> 11:22.850
<i>And the butterflies and bees</i>

11:26.102 --> 11:27.979
This party is so crazy!
