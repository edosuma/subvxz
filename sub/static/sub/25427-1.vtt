00:58.708 --> 01:03.791
I have to leave a house in the middle
of the night because of a man before.

01:03.792 --> 01:08.375
But this is the first time I've had
to leave a country.

01:09.042 --> 01:11.749
7221, you're cleared to enter.

01:11.750 --> 01:14.916
Okay folks, we are now entering
United States airspace.

01:14.917 --> 01:18.083
You're safe now.

01:33.125 --> 01:35.458
I've made this trip before.

01:36.208 --> 01:40.792
There were always dozens of white roses
waiting for me in every suite.

01:41.500 --> 01:45.417
But the men waiting at the
door did not wear uniforms.

01:46.625 --> 01:49.167
They wore Armani.

01:57.542 --> 01:59.500
So, Virginia...

02:00.000 --> 02:03.166
For the next few days, you will meet
with officials from the Justice Department

02:03.167 --> 02:07.124
and they will inform you of the
procedure to follow from now on.

02:07.125 --> 02:10.291
Can someone get me an aspirin please?

02:10.292 --> 02:12.624
My head is going to explode.

02:12.625 --> 02:17.124
Maam, for your own safety, you do not
leave this room or communicate with anyone.

02:17.125 --> 02:20.458
I have two of my best standing outside.

02:20.750 --> 02:22.500
Do you understand?

02:26.542 --> 02:30.374
Can you do bring me an aspirin please?

02:30.375 --> 02:34.666
Virginia, American hotels do
not give out aspirin anymore.

02:34.667 --> 02:37.250
It's considered a drug in this country.

02:56.250 --> 02:59.417
Pablo would have laughed at that too.

02:59.958 --> 03:03.875
Then, he would have had all of them killed.

03:40.375 --> 03:42.375
Come on, guys!

04:07.375 --> 04:09.500
Damn horse

04:21.458 --> 04:24.042
Jesus, poor animal.

04:27.833 --> 04:30.292
We have to finish him patron.

04:33.250 --> 04:35.375
Do it, Pelao.

04:56.042 --> 04:58.708
Fantastic.

04:59.583 --> 05:02.333
Have you seen the guest list?

05:02.917 --> 05:07.707
- Hmmm, It's full of beautiful women.
- Colombia is full of beautiful women mi amor.

05:07.708 --> 05:10.957
- It's a party.
- Actresses, beauty queens...

05:10.958 --> 05:14.083
and soccer players,
union delegates.

05:14.917 --> 05:17.749
- But you are much more beautiful. Look.
- Than the union delegates?

05:17.750 --> 05:19.250
See who's coming.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.374
I don't like it, Pablo.
Business and family separate.

05:25.375 --> 05:27.874
- We already talked about it.
- I know, I know, I know.

05:27.875 --> 05:31.292
With the party everything is a little bit
of a mess. I'll take care of it.

05:39.833 --> 05:42.332
- I have the man you asked for.
- I'll talk to him.

05:42.333 --> 05:44.416
And you take him away.
I don't want him around.

05:44.417 --> 05:47.332
Juan Pablo.

05:47.333 --> 05:49.917
Juan Pablo, if you can find this coin,
you can keep it, go for it.

05:50.125 --> 05:53.457
We are here to raise the mood.

05:53.458 --> 05:57.416
One two three.
Do you hear me?

05:57.417 --> 06:01.207
- Patron.
- I have a job for you in Leticia.

06:01.208 --> 06:05.124
There's a file there from some years ago that
connects me to the murder of two dozen agents.

06:05.125 --> 06:08.249
You have to make them disappear OK?
Everything and the file

06:08.250 --> 06:10.458
- Clean up everything.
- Yes Sir.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.541
You have contacts there, right?

06:12.542 --> 06:15.499
Of course patron.
My cousin's wife works at the courthouse.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.833
- She can get me in there's no problem.
- Dad?

06:18.708 --> 06:21.832
OK, I don't care if you
have to take out somebody.

06:21.833 --> 06:24.542
Or what you have to do.
You can burn the building down if you want.

06:25.292 --> 06:27.916
But get rid of that file, understood?

06:27.917 --> 06:33.457
You get 30,000 for expenses: For traveling,
for ammunition, for room, for everything.

06:33.458 --> 06:36.166
If you ran out, ask Salvador
for more money if needed.

06:36.167 --> 06:37.042
Dad?

06:37.043 --> 06:40.041
- He'll take care of it. Get started now.
- Yes Boss.

06:40.042 --> 06:42.874
Did you find the coin?
It's only five pesos.

06:42.875 --> 06:44.125
Only five pesos?

06:44.167 --> 06:46.666
Juan Pablo, do you know how hard your
daddy has to work to make some money?

06:46.667 --> 06:48.625
Give it to me back.

06:49.167 --> 06:50.958
"Only five pesos."

06:55.458 --> 06:57.957
Is that the hacienda down there?

06:57.958 --> 07:01.083
We have been flying away
for a while, my love.

07:16.250 --> 07:18.250
Connect with the boss.

07:22.167 --> 07:28.082
- We are getting kidnapped.
- It's okay, Virgie. Calm down.

07:28.083 --> 07:31.875
It's not OK. Do we know how
much all of us here are worth?

07:33.750 --> 07:37.833
We've all heard about our host,
but none of us had ever met him.

07:38.750 --> 07:42.666
His name is at the top of
the list of the noveau rich.

07:42.667 --> 07:48.583
A group of young men that have made
huge fortunes in very little time.

07:53.125 --> 07:54.583
Welcome.

07:55.875 --> 07:58.291
Please don't mind the weapons.
They're for the animals.

07:58.292 --> 08:00.541
We have a little zoo here.
Do you like to see it?

08:00.542 --> 08:02.707
You scared us to death.

08:02.708 --> 08:06.082
Tell our host this is not the way
to welcome guests.

08:06.083 --> 08:08.208
As soon as I see him.

08:22.125 --> 08:24.332
There they are.

08:24.333 --> 08:28.292
Oh my God, they are beautiful.

08:28.583 --> 08:32.291
They are very happy here.
They like Colombia.

08:32.292 --> 08:35.582
That's because they don't read the papers.

08:39.667 --> 08:42.499
This house is gigantic.

08:42.500 --> 08:45.666
I don't see the servants anywhere.

08:45.667 --> 08:47.750
There you have then

08:48.542 --> 08:52.625
This new elite has its
own social structure.

08:53.458 --> 08:56.541
Down in the corridors, the soldiers:

08:56.542 --> 08:59.791
Young, uneducated men from the slums.

08:59.792 --> 09:02.707
Warriors in their organization.

09:02.708 --> 09:05.666
They're nothing like the humble
servants working on the ranches

09:05.667 --> 09:08.874
of the traditionally rich
people in my country.

09:08.875 --> 09:13.957
They're confident, they
handle security and operations and...

09:13.958 --> 09:17.582
How are you, Miss Virginia?
Good evening.

09:17.583 --> 09:20.333
Have good taste in women.

09:22.500 --> 09:27.624
Virginia, I never miss your show.
You look so Beautiful.

09:27.625 --> 09:30.708
Thank you, ma'am. You look amazing.

09:33.833 --> 09:37.166
Above them, the cream.

09:37.167 --> 09:39.999
Artists, businessmen, soccer players.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.832
Journalists, Models.

09:42.833 --> 09:46.957
Always a perfect distance
away from our host.

09:46.958 --> 09:49.166
Cover your ears, Victor.

09:49.167 --> 09:52.667
There are so many handsome guys here.

09:53.292 --> 09:57.166
You look wonderful in that dress.
Thank you.

09:57.167 --> 10:00.457
Anyone who's anyone is here.

10:00.458 --> 10:04.166
Excuse me, where does
he make all this money?

10:04.167 --> 10:07.542
That's the question a
reporter has to ask.

10:15.333 --> 10:18.167
Bravo! Bravo!

10:18.833 --> 10:22.541
Senorita Vallejo, it's an honor
to have you with us tonight.

10:22.542 --> 10:26.542
An admirer wants to
dedicate this song to you.

10:30.125 --> 10:32.458
See what you have to say!

10:33.375 --> 10:35.916
Virginia, Virginia.

10:35.917 --> 10:38.874
Ay Maria, where have you been hiding?

10:38.875 --> 10:43.249
Pablo keeps asking for you.
He's drivng us crazy, so come on.

10:43.250 --> 10:47.750
Victor, wait here. Don't fall in love
with anyone.

10:52.875 --> 10:57.249
And up the hill,
the kings of the white mountain.

10:57.250 --> 11:00.333
We still don't know
their names, but soon,

11:00.375 --> 11:03.707
there won't be a single
Colombian who doesn't.

11:03.708 --> 11:07.624
She was easy to find.
I just went where all the men were looking.

11:07.625 --> 11:13.291
- Pablo? Pablo Escobar?
- I'll leave you alone.

11:13.292 --> 11:16.666
Your complaints were passed
on to me by your paper.

11:16.667 --> 11:17.999
You lied to me.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.792
O Maria, of course I lied to you.
I did not want you to leave.

11:23.042 --> 11:28.167
You're looking prettier in person.
Then I have to fire my makeup girl.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.707
There's a lot of talk about you over there.
Speculations about your past.

11:33.708 --> 11:36.166
No, no, no, don't listen to them.

11:36.167 --> 11:38.499
I only listen when they
speculate about my future.

11:38.500 --> 11:40.791
I already know my past.

11:40.792 --> 11:44.999
- And what's the occasion?
- This is the founding of a society.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.749
What kind of society?
Philanthropic

11:47.750 --> 11:49.792
We are building
houses for the poor.

11:49.833 --> 11:53.250
Nobody over there mentioned to
you my relations to the slums?

11:54.292 --> 11:58.207
We want to build 2,000 homes
for the people on the garbage dump.

11:58.208 --> 12:02.291
- I got a good prize on a lot.
- And where does the money come from?

12:02.292 --> 12:05.166
- What is this? Is this an interview?
- I'm a journalist.

12:05.167 --> 12:07.792
Then, come and see.

12:08.333 --> 12:11.332
Come and see and I'll show you.
It's good for the country to know.

12:11.333 --> 12:14.457
Good for the country, or good for you?

12:14.458 --> 12:17.500
Am I not part of the country?

12:20.625 --> 12:24.874
We weren't aware at that time, but
that night, we were celebrating

12:24.875 --> 12:26.999
the founding of the Medellin cartel

12:27.000 --> 12:30.832
and the crowning of Pablo as its' king.

12:30.833 --> 12:33.416
Things were about to change forever.

12:33.417 --> 12:36.667
In Colombia and in my life.

13:00.417 --> 13:03.666
Breathe through your mouth,
so you can get used to the stench

13:03.667 --> 13:06.749
And watch where you stand.
People dump bodies out here sometimes.

13:06.750 --> 13:07.958
You're kidding.

13:12.500 --> 13:16.249
Don Pablo! Don Pablo!

13:16.250 --> 13:18.707
Pablito. How's your mom?
Is she recovering?

13:18.708 --> 13:21.541
Paulito! Don Pablo is here. Come here.

13:21.542 --> 13:26.167
- Is everybody here named Pablo?
- Everybody. They named if after him.

13:26.625 --> 13:32.917
Listen, we are now finishing the first
600, but we want to build 2000. 2000

13:33.708 --> 13:36.000
Oh my God.

13:36.625 --> 13:42.207
Good day, Senor Escobar. Please tell
our viewers the motivation and goal

13:42.208 --> 13:46.167
behind this wonderful initiative,
"Medellin without slum".

13:46.833 --> 13:50.499
Well, it is painful for us to see
so many children starving

13:50.500 --> 13:54.332
and completely abandoned
by the government.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.624
And building these houses for them

13:56.625 --> 13:59.375
helps us to create a country
that we always dreamed about.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.707
I love Colombia and now
that we have a chance

14:02.708 --> 14:06.208
to give back to this beautiful
country that gave us so much.

14:06.250 --> 14:08.499
That is exactly what we're doing.

14:08.500 --> 14:13.166
That day, I decide that I don't
care how Pablo makes his money.

14:13.167 --> 14:16.000
Only how he uses it.

14:22.458 --> 14:24.750
Come in please.

14:27.417 --> 14:29.582
Virginia, how beautiful you are.

14:29.583 --> 14:32.374
Thanks sweetie. Thanks.

14:32.375 --> 14:35.458
- Miss Virginia.
- A pleasure.

14:39.167 --> 14:41.958
Do you know that people?

14:43.708 --> 14:46.416
I like the way you laugh.
You laugh like that in your show.

14:46.417 --> 14:49.166
You are so relaxed on TV.
How do you do that?

14:49.167 --> 14:52.707
- Do you think I can ever do that?
- There are tricks.

14:52.708 --> 14:55.917
- Are you after my job?
- No I'm not.

14:58.458 --> 15:00.667
Are you married?

15:02.542 --> 15:05.957
- Not by choice.
- What does he do?

15:05.958 --> 15:11.082
He's a plastic surgeon. We are separated,
but he does not want to sign the divorce.

15:11.083 --> 15:12.999
Ah, he does not want you
to get married again?

15:13.000 --> 15:16.667
No, he does not want to have marry
one of his teenage girlfriends.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Well, that can be fixed

15:25.000 --> 15:27.708
Hmm, you talk to him.

15:31.375 --> 15:37.916
I mean, I don't like hanging
around with married women. I don't.

15:37.917 --> 15:41.666
So next time we're going out,
you're not going to be his wife.

15:41.667 --> 15:43.958
- No?
- No.

15:44.375 --> 15:46.082
Will I be his widow?

15:46.083 --> 15:50.333
Ay Maria, Virginia,
what do you take me for?

15:51.042 --> 15:55.417
Now we take that damn! Take him out!

15:55.958 --> 15:57.875
Outside!

15:58.708 --> 16:01.374
- Everyone ready?
- Virginia!

16:01.375 --> 16:04.207
Your lawyer called.
Your ex signed the papers.

16:04.208 --> 16:08.250
We are all in three, two...

16:16.917 --> 16:19.541
To celebrate me being free again

16:19.542 --> 16:24.249
Pablo takes me to an island paradise
only he knows about.

16:24.250 --> 16:30.333
If you're going to cry over a man,
better on a private jet than on a bus.

17:01.000 --> 17:05.291
- Where are you going?
- They are waiting.

17:06.041 --> 17:07.750
Who?

17:13.208 --> 17:16.041
- Do I look OK?
- You look perfect.

17:17.500 --> 17:20.665
How is it going patron?
Maam

17:20.666 --> 17:25.166
Here's my caveat, if you tell me your
secrets and I'll tell you mine, okay?

17:29.250 --> 17:33.625
Our trip is an excuse to attend
a congress of drug traffickers.

17:35.917 --> 17:38.499
Gentlemen, Virginia Vallejo.

17:38.500 --> 17:41.582
Virginia, how are you? When
did you arrive? -Today.

17:41.583 --> 17:45.166
Pablo introduces me to his
associates in the cartel.

17:45.167 --> 17:47.957
He shows me off to them like a trophy.

17:47.958 --> 17:51.541
And I know they are also
there to evaluate me.

17:51.542 --> 17:56.499
Between them, they form a new
social class: the Narco Millionaires.

17:56.500 --> 18:00.416
And I'm the only journalist with
exclusive access to their first summit.

18:00.417 --> 18:03.332
Thank you. I'm going to get a drink.

18:03.333 --> 18:07.457
Stay close, Virginia.
These men can't be trusted. Ok?

18:07.458 --> 18:12.125
The most illegal thing I've ever done
before that day was to double-park.

18:13.083 --> 18:18.250
But the truth is, never in
my life had I felt safer.

18:19.708 --> 18:23.000
Our lower priorities label where Colombia
doesn't change.

18:23.500 --> 18:27.374
That night they split the
United States of America among them.

18:27.375 --> 18:29.457
Florida for the Medellin cartel.

18:29.458 --> 18:32.291
New York for the Cali cartel.

18:32.292 --> 18:35.499
The independents and other
shipments to Pablo's.

18:35.500 --> 18:40.542
They know that nobody would ever dare to
steal even one gram from him.

18:43.708 --> 18:48.708
Seeing him in his natural
habitat is, addictive.

18:51.333 --> 18:56.625
Thanks to those men, it is going to snow
cocaine in the US.

19:07.417 --> 19:09.792
Honey, did you see that?

19:21.750 --> 19:25.749
Hey guys, are you nuts?
What the fuck are you doing?

19:25.750 --> 19:30.667
Back to the car, quickly!
Stay away!

19:38.083 --> 19:43.958
Stuck in a jam on Highway
75 heading Southbound. Eric Temple

19:52.708 --> 19:55.208
Holy shit!

20:14.750 --> 20:17.541
What are you doing?
Are you fucking nuts?

20:17.542 --> 20:19.666
I almost killed you!

20:19.667 --> 20:25.208
They call them the saints, because they make
the miracle of multiplication up there.

20:25.667 --> 20:27.082
Do the math.

20:27.083 --> 20:30.749
One kilo is worth 7,000 dollars
here in Colombia.

20:30.750 --> 20:36.166
In the United States, they cut it, add
lactose and it becomes three kilos

20:36.167 --> 20:41.750
which are worth a 150,000 there.
Is that a miracle or not?

20:49.375 --> 20:52.000
- Oh my God!
- Jim, stop!

20:52.708 --> 20:54.208
Oh shit!

21:26.875 --> 21:30.874
From the White House:
President and Mrs. Ronald Reagan.

21:30.875 --> 21:33.082
A message on drugs.

21:33.083 --> 21:38.750
Despite our best efforts, illegal cocaine is
coming in to our country at alarming levels

21:38.875 --> 21:43.375
It's especially damaging to the young
people, on whom our future depends.

21:43.583 --> 21:47.082
So tonight, from our family to yours.

21:47.083 --> 21:49.249
From our home to yours.

21:49.250 --> 21:51.500
Thank you for joining us.

21:52.333 --> 21:56.124
America has accomplished so
much in these last few years...

21:56.125 --> 21:59.916
Welcome, Agent Shepard.
President's glad to have you on board.

21:59.917 --> 22:03.375
This is Mr. Velarde, representing
the Colombian government.

22:04.500 --> 22:07.707
The president is worried
about the latest report.

22:07.708 --> 22:11.666
Cocaine is no longer the drug of the
jetset, it's reaching the middle class.

22:11.667 --> 22:14.082
- You know what that means.
- It's coming in without control.

22:14.083 --> 22:16.416
80% of it is coming from Colombia.

22:16.417 --> 22:19.624
We are working to have an
old bilateral treaty re-activated.

22:19.625 --> 22:20.833
The Extradition Treaty.

22:20.875 --> 22:24.499
We'll catch the narcos and turn them
over to you so you can try them here.

22:24.500 --> 22:28.999
They don't fear the judges in Colombia.
Either bribe them or kill them.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.166
- But they do fear your justice.
- Is there a legal basis for this?

22:32.167 --> 22:35.832
The coke is produced in my
country, but is consumed here.

22:35.833 --> 22:38.750
The crime is completed
in the United States.

22:39.083 --> 22:41.458
I brought a draft.

22:41.875 --> 22:45.832
The President knows your record.
He wants you to monitor the whole process.

22:45.833 --> 22:47.666
The president will
be off shortly.

22:47.667 --> 22:50.499
We are hoping to implement
this in the next day or so.

22:50.500 --> 22:55.875
Don't take away the dream from every child's
heart and replace it with a nightmare.

22:56.292 --> 23:01.292
And it's time we in America
stand up and replace those dreams.

23:01.833 --> 23:05.457
What are we, children?
Don't we have judges here?

23:05.458 --> 23:09.458
No mother sends her children to
the neighbors to be punished. No.

23:10.708 --> 23:15.124
What do the lawyers have to say? Is it
constitutional? Can it be appealed?

23:15.125 --> 23:18.249
- Yeah, it can be appealed.
- We have to knock it down.

23:18.250 --> 23:21.041
That treaty put us in danger.
To everyone here,

23:21.042 --> 23:24.167
everyone of you,
every one of us. See.

23:24.958 --> 23:29.041
We have to fight it from the institution
from inside.

23:29.042 --> 23:32.666
- From Congress? It's the only way.
- From many of them. Both sides.

23:32.667 --> 23:36.582
Conservatives and liberals,
they all like the good stuff.

23:36.583 --> 23:40.291
Look at me, Pablo.
This politics is bad for business.

23:40.292 --> 23:43.207
And whatever they look for in your
house, they find in everyone else's.

23:43.208 --> 23:47.249
Listen to us, please.
They'll go after you.

23:47.250 --> 23:50.291
Politics is a bitch.

23:50.292 --> 23:53.707
No, my brother, it's the other way around.
If you reach the congress they respect you.

23:53.708 --> 23:56.750
Why? Because you're one of them.

23:57.708 --> 24:01.957
You know how much it costs to run
for a state council in Colombia?

24:01.958 --> 24:04.916
10 million pesos. 10 million pesos.

24:04.917 --> 24:10.124
And for senator I think it is
between 100 and 120 million pesos.

24:10.125 --> 24:14.624
1500 million pesos, more or
less, for president of the republic.

24:14.625 --> 24:17.166
Tell me who can spend
that kind of money?

24:17.167 --> 24:20.208
The son of a farmer? A worker?

24:20.958 --> 24:23.457
Oh no. Politics comes down to money here.

24:23.458 --> 24:26.124
Democracy comes down to money here so.

24:26.125 --> 24:28.625
We have plenty, of money.

24:30.958 --> 24:33.624
You, Garza, what's so funny?

24:33.625 --> 24:35.874
If you're listening to yourself, Pablito.

24:35.875 --> 24:38.333
You're already talking like a politician.

25:01.083 --> 25:03.708
Sir, we have an appointment
with your candidate.

25:06.458 --> 25:09.499
Are they armed?
Of course they are, they are my bodyguards.

25:09.500 --> 25:12.291
I'm sorry sir but if they're
armed, they can not come in.

25:12.292 --> 25:13.458
Listen to me.

25:14.250 --> 25:16.416
They have a donation to the campaign.

25:16.417 --> 25:18.832
If they do not come in, the
donation can't either.

25:18.833 --> 25:22.167
So go ask your candidate if
that's what he wants.

25:24.833 --> 25:26.708
Ask him

25:28.833 --> 25:31.083
A moment.

25:32.958 --> 25:35.582
The cartel bets on both horses.

25:35.583 --> 25:39.957
Why put money on only one candidate
when you can put money on both?

25:39.958 --> 25:43.625
That way, no matter
who wins, they win.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.125
The narcos planes carry
candidates during the day...

25:48.542 --> 25:51.458
and fly to the United States at night.

25:54.792 --> 25:57.417
And what do they get in exchange?

25:57.792 --> 26:03.332
You defend the competency of the Supreme
Court towards the constituionality of the

26:03.333 --> 26:06.249
It will be good for all of us, Mr.
Candidate.

26:06.250 --> 26:12.083
This gentlemen want to donate 25 million
pesos to our campaign here in Antioquia.

26:13.667 --> 26:17.957
People call the contributions made by
the drug lords "hot money".

26:17.958 --> 26:19.082
Why?

26:19.083 --> 26:24.750
Its OK. You can leave it on the floor.
Will find someone to pick it up later.

26:27.250 --> 26:29.542
Because it burns.

26:31.917 --> 26:34.541
How far are you going to take this Pablo?

26:34.542 --> 26:37.291
We're doing fine. Don't we have enough?

26:37.292 --> 26:40.666
My love, in Congress I can do things
I can help people...

26:40.667 --> 26:42.917
Help your family first.

26:43.458 --> 26:46.916
You have money, Pablo. You have us.
What more do you want?

26:46.917 --> 26:49.042
I want respect.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.667
- Respect?
- Yes, I want respect.

26:56.875 --> 26:59.999
I want my son to be proud of me.

27:00.000 --> 27:01.541
Is that so hard to understand?

27:01.542 --> 27:04.458
First he have to see you,
Pablo, but you're never home.

27:05.375 --> 27:10.208
Juan Pablo, my boy, go to the living room.
There is nothing on TV?

27:11.333 --> 27:13.875
God, who bought him that car?

27:17.125 --> 27:20.917
Victoria, my love, don't you want
to be the first lady?

27:21.792 --> 27:24.124
I'd settle for being the
only lady, Pablo.

27:24.125 --> 27:29.708
Ay maria, no, no again. She's helping me
with my political campaign.

27:31.292 --> 27:34.166
- I want respect to Pablo like you.
- I respect you.

27:34.167 --> 27:36.999
No, senor the difference is yours
is not enough for me.

27:37.000 --> 27:40.666
- I respect you.
- No you don't.

27:40.667 --> 27:45.000
I'll prove it. What do you want me to do?
What? I'll do it. What?

27:45.625 --> 27:49.917
That bitch from TV,
end it with her

27:52.167 --> 27:55.792
I promise right now it is over, now.

27:56.583 --> 27:58.167
Now.

27:59.292 --> 28:01.625
Right now, honey.

28:01.958 --> 28:03.874
Come here.

28:03.875 --> 28:06.958
I promise. I promise

28:07.583 --> 28:10.291
I promise. It is over.

28:10.292 --> 28:15.708
So yes, see give me one
of those laughs. Yes.

28:25.458 --> 28:30.458
The style disappeared with the jeans.
What a shame.

28:40.375 --> 28:42.749
We want a country like a mother

28:42.750 --> 28:46.332
generous and fertile who shares her wealth
equally with her children,

28:46.333 --> 28:49.208
but who always looks out for the weakest.

28:53.333 --> 28:56.041
We want a country like a mother

28:56.042 --> 29:00.416
who defends her children from
foreign aggression without hesitation

29:00.417 --> 29:02.916
Hard but understanding.

29:02.917 --> 29:06.416
Long live the mothers of Colombia
and the motherland.

29:06.417 --> 29:10.541
They will cry tears of blood the
day their first son is handed out.

29:10.542 --> 29:13.125
Thanks. Thanks.

29:14.417 --> 29:17.791
Let's stay in Antioquia
to see how election day has gone.

29:17.792 --> 29:21.582
At this time, most of the
votes have been counted.

29:21.583 --> 29:25.082
For Alternative Popular,
Movimiento de Renevación Liberal

29:25.083 --> 29:31.458
Pablo Escobar Gaviria has been
elected repreentative of Medellin.

29:32.083 --> 29:34.542
For Colombia...

29:53.792 --> 29:58.082
Senator Escobar is denied entry
the first day he attends congress.

29:58.083 --> 30:03.124
Why? Because he smuggles 40 tons of
cocaine a year into the United States?

30:03.125 --> 30:04.249
No.

30:04.250 --> 30:08.042
I'm sorry sir, but a tie is required
to enter the chamber.

30:09.875 --> 30:13.375
Take mine! Take mine, Pablo!

30:23.125 --> 30:25.583
That's my country for you.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.832
What are you doing looking through my bag?

30:40.833 --> 30:44.208
That's not where you'll find
a picture of my lover.

30:47.333 --> 30:51.499
What's that?
Surprise, surprise for you.

30:51.500 --> 30:55.166
- Pablo, take that money out of my bag right now!
- Why?

30:55.167 --> 30:58.499
You're not gonna put me in danger. I have
nothing to do with your business, OK.

30:58.500 --> 31:03.332
This is a gift to you, Virginia.
This is for you to enjoy it.

31:03.333 --> 31:06.417
- This is a gift for me?
- Yes.

31:06.750 --> 31:10.416
- But, Pablo, that's a lot of money!
- I know, I know, but don't worry.

31:10.417 --> 31:12.874
The American government doesn't
care how much you bring in.

31:12.875 --> 31:14.332
It only cares how
much you take out.

31:14.333 --> 31:16.749
So you can declare it all
when you get to customs.

31:16.750 --> 31:20.124
But it's too much, I cannot accept it
Look it doesn't even fit.

31:20.125 --> 31:24.791
A surprise, doesn't fit. We have to take out
all the clothes, you can buy new ones there.

31:24.792 --> 31:27.124
See, take them all out. Take them all out.

31:27.125 --> 31:29.957
But you have to spend all that money. You
can bring anything back with you Virginia.

31:29.958 --> 31:34.292
Oh my God. All my life waiting
to hear those words.

31:35.875 --> 31:38.000
You wonderful man!

31:43.083 --> 31:48.332
Colombians don't turn on their
TVs to see me but what I'm wearing.

31:48.333 --> 31:52.500
Pablo is aware of this and
he takes care of all my needs.

32:01.958 --> 32:05.666
This is called coca paste.

32:05.667 --> 32:09.124
And the poorest drug addicts mix it
with gasoline and call it "bazook".

32:09.125 --> 32:13.667
This stuff will fry your brain. There is
nothing is worse than this, do you understand?

32:15.625 --> 32:20.082
Now, when you cook it, you get
this little white powder,

32:20.083 --> 32:24.041
but it's the same thing.
We work with this, okay?

32:24.042 --> 32:27.125
But we do not take it here.

32:27.667 --> 32:30.249
Have you heard of Nancy Reagan?

32:30.250 --> 32:32.874
No? She's a very important lady.

32:32.875 --> 32:36.499
She says that if anybody offers
you this stuff, you just say no.

32:36.500 --> 32:41.874
You're going to listen to that lady, to
her and to your Daddy. You just say no.

32:41.875 --> 32:44.624
Okay? Understood?

32:44.625 --> 32:46.458
Good, my boy.

32:56.417 --> 33:00.750
- Hello, how may I help you?
- Hello. 88 please, thank you.

33:06.333 --> 33:08.750
- Miss Vallejo?
- Yes?

33:10.500 --> 33:13.541
- Do we know each other?
- Do you have any plans?

33:13.542 --> 33:16.208
May I have a moment of your time?

33:18.500 --> 33:22.125
Do you lack self-confidence, Agent Shepard?

33:24.667 --> 33:26.750
- Give me two hours?
- Sure.

33:41.292 --> 33:45.625
- I saw your interview with Mr. Escobar.
- Thousands of people saw it.

33:46.792 --> 33:49.000
What can you tell me about him?

33:49.958 --> 33:53.582
So dissappointing. You're not interested
in me. You are interested in Pablo.

33:53.583 --> 33:55.708
I'm a married man.

33:58.833 --> 34:00.792
So you know how he makes his money?

34:01.917 --> 34:05.416
- What does your embassy over there tell you?
- Nothing good.

34:05.417 --> 34:09.706
No, Mr Escobar is an elected
government representative.

34:09.708 --> 34:14.333
So I don't think the DEA has any legal
authority to interfere in Colombian politics.

34:15.875 --> 34:21.123
The drugs produced in your country
are entering mine and that worries us.

34:21.125 --> 34:23.998
No. No.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.541
Your government is only
worried about the money

34:26.542 --> 34:29.123
leaving the country not
the drugs that come in.

34:29.125 --> 34:31.331
They don't have this problem
with the Italian mafia

34:31.333 --> 34:35.416
because what they make stays here.
Drug money is different. It flies away.

34:35.417 --> 34:37.833
That's what worries you.

34:43.208 --> 34:47.291
What did he say? Pablo?

34:47.292 --> 34:50.833
When you told him that you're
coming to meet me? What did he say?

34:53.708 --> 34:57.125
He said to make sure the
United States pays the bill.

34:58.958 --> 35:01.083
You two are involved.

35:01.833 --> 35:04.333
You have the nerve to ask me that?

35:05.083 --> 35:08.875
- Why don't you ask your friends at the CIA?
- I will.

35:09.667 --> 35:14.708
You know what?
I would have agreed to a drink...

35:16.500 --> 35:19.375
even without the badge.

35:41.542 --> 35:44.332
Where is Pablo?
He had to go to Bogota.

35:44.333 --> 35:47.957
Congress is calling a special session.

35:47.958 --> 35:51.541
They want to revoke his appointment.

35:51.542 --> 35:53.291
They cannot do that.

35:53.292 --> 35:56.208
Well. that bastard minister of justice
has it out for us.

35:56.833 --> 35:59.042
He requested a review.

36:00.875 --> 36:03.207
Things are getting wild Virginia.

36:03.208 --> 36:05.499
The whole country is watching us.

36:05.500 --> 36:07.667
We are in the spotlight.

36:11.917 --> 36:14.666
Congressman, this is a disgrace!

36:14.667 --> 36:19.582
These men, who became
inexplicably rich overnight,

36:19.583 --> 36:23.832
have reached this sacred institution
with their shady dealings.

36:23.833 --> 36:28.417
Their presence in the house is an
insult to every Colombian.

36:40.875 --> 36:43.082
Congressman Escobar.

36:43.083 --> 36:48.125
It certainly must have been quite a
struggle for you to obtain your fortune...

36:49.083 --> 36:52.166
and to go from having a few
properties in Medellin

36:52.167 --> 36:56.917
to accumulating more than two billion
dollars in less than two years.

37:31.750 --> 37:35.791
Mr. President, Fellow Congressmen.

37:35.792 --> 37:41.749
Apparently, his honor the Minister of Justice
doesn't believe that a person of humble origin

37:41.750 --> 37:46.916
can through hard work, reach a higher
social position or a seat in this room.

37:46.917 --> 37:50.332
Maybe you should question
your own presence here Mr. Minister.

37:50.333 --> 37:52.916
Because if you don't believe in
the justice that you represent.

37:52.917 --> 37:56.124
Then you want the justice system of another
country for our citizens.

37:56.125 --> 37:59.667
So you don't deserve your position.
You should resign.

38:04.083 --> 38:09.792
You have lied today by suggesting that my
money is linked to drug trafficking.

38:10.792 --> 38:15.625
That's why, I'm giving your honor 24 hours to present
solid evidence of your accussations against me

38:16.792 --> 38:18.625
Actually you are the one who should explain

38:18.833 --> 38:22.542
the origin of the money
that financed your campaign.

38:25.250 --> 38:27.167
Mr. President.

38:27.625 --> 38:29.374
Mr. President.

38:29.375 --> 38:34.249
I will bring, I will bring proof to
this room, of the quantities

38:34.250 --> 38:38.499
that you and some of your colleagues
have received from certain people.

38:38.500 --> 38:42.083
Yes, unlike you, solid proof.

38:42.667 --> 38:45.082
When, where and how much.

38:45.083 --> 38:48.208
Evidence. Thank you very
much, Mr. President.

38:49.333 --> 38:52.500
Resign! Resign!

38:58.125 --> 38:59.708
Apparently...

39:00.208 --> 39:03.374
Congressman Escobar has
detailed information

39:03.375 --> 39:05.958
about how drug
trafficking operates.

39:06.458 --> 39:11.875
Which continues to surprise for a humble
and hardworking man like himself.

39:19.458 --> 39:23.666
Pablo, resign.
Leave, leave before they kick you out.

39:23.667 --> 39:26.832
I want my son to see
me there, Victoria.

39:26.833 --> 39:30.707
You don't want your son to see what the
whole country saw today, Pablo.

39:30.708 --> 39:33.791
Those men clapping in there today
and laughing in there today

39:33.792 --> 39:35.000
they have a lot to hide.

39:35.083 --> 39:37.999
The President publicly
backed the Minister.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.082
The President backs the minister
because he has a lot to hide too.

39:40.083 --> 39:42.667
So what are going to do
accuse the President as well

39:42.708 --> 39:44.208
in front of of the whole country?

39:44.375 --> 39:46.832
Pablo, you're a drug trafficker.

39:46.833 --> 39:49.791
Yes, and those bastards
they stand up when I call them.

39:49.792 --> 39:53.624
And they come to my parties and
they grab every penny I gave them.

39:53.625 --> 39:56.082
- The damn pig!
- You promised me everything will be alright.

39:56.083 --> 39:59.042
- Everything is fine.
- I'm pregnant.

40:00.542 --> 40:02.833
My Beloved...

40:03.292 --> 40:04.874
My Beloved.

40:04.875 --> 40:07.416
I don't want our baby to suffer.
It won't suffer."

40:07.417 --> 40:10.041
Promise me it won't suffer.

40:10.042 --> 40:12.958
Promise me, or I won't have it.

40:14.458 --> 40:18.542
Yes? Hello? Who is this?

40:21.000 --> 40:23.832
Motherfuckers! The damn fuckers!

40:23.833 --> 40:26.499
I don't want to a single newspaper
on the street. No no, not one.

40:26.500 --> 40:29.666
I will pay 500 pesos per copy,
do you understand me?

40:29.667 --> 40:33.291
Spread the word in the slums. Take off

40:33.292 --> 40:36.542
Motherfuckers.
Calm down, Pablo.

40:39.875 --> 40:42.000
Those fuckers.

40:47.042 --> 40:51.541
El Espectador does a cover story
about the sins of Pablo's youth

40:51.542 --> 40:54.292
backing the minister's accusations.

41:01.583 --> 41:04.041
Come on, hurry up!

41:04.042 --> 41:06.416
His criminal record
include his involvement

41:06.417 --> 41:09.542
in the murder of two police
officers in Leticia.

41:10.833 --> 41:13.458
Goodbye, career in politics.

41:15.542 --> 41:18.667
Don't you think you're killing me?
Kill me then!

41:19.083 --> 41:23.749
The villagers Pablo sent
to erase his past didn't do his job.

41:23.750 --> 41:28.000
He spent the money on women who
will not mourn his death today.

41:29.458 --> 41:32.624
Do you intend to kill me or not?
Kill me then!

41:32.625 --> 41:35.875
- Shut up!
- Beat him, you coward!

41:37.208 --> 41:39.417
Gay!

41:45.958 --> 41:50.625
Our Father in heaven, let
your name be sanctified!

41:52.167 --> 41:54.250
Help him, damn fighters.

42:07.292 --> 42:11.999
Since he is such an important minister, I have
three different operations prepared for him.

42:12.000 --> 42:16.749
You want to know about them I'll let you know
and you let me know which one you like the most

42:16.750 --> 42:20.582
But if you prefer none now...
I'll do it anyway.

42:20.583 --> 42:24.041
He's a minister, Pablo.
You can't kill a minister.

42:24.042 --> 42:26.958
No? Who says that? You?

42:29.083 --> 42:32.624
It's time to start killing people so
they learn to respect us.

42:32.625 --> 42:37.082
Listen, this is how it goes. Every one
of us put up ten million pesos for expenses

42:37.083 --> 42:42.625
so that way we all are commited. Either we are
all innocent or we are all guilty. That easy.

42:43.792 --> 42:46.874
You're gonna create a company
to kill a minister?

42:46.875 --> 42:50.874
In Cali we do not want to mix blood
with business. It complicates things.

42:50.875 --> 42:55.292
Things are already complicated.
Haven't you noticed up there in Cali?

42:56.458 --> 42:59.457
With war you can't win halfway.

42:59.458 --> 43:03.291
There are no half-winners and half-losers.
You have to go all the way in.

43:03.292 --> 43:06.916
I mean you people in Cali don't like blood then
you you better not come to my house to insult me.

43:06.917 --> 43:11.208
Pablo, he didn't mean to insult you.
Then I didn't mean to warn him.

43:13.375 --> 43:15.042
Listen my friend.

43:15.792 --> 43:17.957
Lara will not be in the
country for a long.

43:17.958 --> 43:22.332
They're sending him somewhere as
ambassador. Then you can kill him.

43:22.333 --> 43:25.875
I was insulted by a minister,
not an ambassador.

43:27.042 --> 43:29.458
Do you want to hear the plans?

43:51.042 --> 43:53.625
Are they decided? Ok.

43:55.167 --> 43:57.417
They think they are.

44:04.833 --> 44:06.333
Here.

44:08.708 --> 44:10.750
What are we celebrating?

44:11.167 --> 44:13.625
That everything is going to change.

44:15.625 --> 44:19.332
I want you to carry it with you all the
time, all the time.

44:19.333 --> 44:23.208
- Oh, Pablo.
- Open it. Open it.

44:24.542 --> 44:26.417
Open it.

44:45.292 --> 44:48.042
Is... This is a joke?

44:48.667 --> 44:53.583
This is a not a joke. Things are going
to get very complicated, Virginia. Very.

44:56.667 --> 44:59.500
I don't need a gun, Pablo.
Not me.

45:01.833 --> 45:06.250
Virginia, I need you to understand
what will happen the day they come for you.

45:07.542 --> 45:11.375
They will rip off your clothes that you are
wearing then. What is...

45:14.042 --> 45:16.042
- Thierry Mugler.
- That one.

45:16.917 --> 45:20.499
They'll put it around your ankles and
they will hold you down on the ground

45:20.500 --> 45:24.416
while many, many soldiers take
turns to rape you.

45:24.417 --> 45:28.957
And they will bring them just for you
from the jungle, hungry for a woman.

45:28.958 --> 45:34.124
And they will get on you one after another
until they turn your back down into pieces

45:34.125 --> 45:38.707
Then they will break bottles and they
will stick those broken bottles in it

45:38.708 --> 45:42.000
And they will stick
blenders and hair dryers...

45:44.125 --> 45:46.082
and they will turn them on full blast
inside of you yes.

45:46.083 --> 45:50.916
And when you think you are going to faint,
they will wake you up with cold water,

45:50.917 --> 45:54.458
so you are awake for
the next group of soldiers.

45:55.917 --> 46:01.417
Then they will let you bleed till
you die from inside.

46:03.083 --> 46:07.542
So this is why this is the best gift
I can ever give you my love. Take it.

46:11.250 --> 46:16.957
If there are three coming at you, take out
the first one, the one whose closest.

46:16.958 --> 46:20.042
I mean, if they are four more... then

46:25.208 --> 46:27.917
Yes, you better kill yourself.

46:28.625 --> 46:32.083
I want to go. I want to go

46:32.583 --> 46:35.042
- Don't cry.
- I want to go.

46:37.667 --> 46:41.458
Okay, I'll bring you home.

46:50.708 --> 46:53.624
Sicarios.

46:53.625 --> 46:55.749
The narcos give the boys
in the slums

46:55.750 --> 46:59.250
the education they don"t get
from the government.

46:59.542 --> 47:03.249
They don't mind dying if they
can leave 20,000 to their mothers.

47:03.250 --> 47:07.000
Because they know that's more
than they will make in a lifetime.

47:27.292 --> 47:32.708
To be a good sicario, you have to be
more than just prepared to kill.

47:33.458 --> 47:35.875
You have to be prepared to die.

47:42.958 --> 47:44.708
The motorcycle!

47:58.167 --> 48:01.167
Closer! Closer!

48:09.667 --> 48:14.500
My God, Colombia is full of geniuses
and intelligent people like you.

48:14.875 --> 48:17.874
Juan, Carlos Andrés, thank you very much.

48:17.875 --> 48:20.332
And now lets go to Cartegena de Indias

48:20.333 --> 48:24.416
where they are celebrating one of the
biggest events in Colombia.

48:24.417 --> 48:29.667
No. We just received a
news update saying...

48:32.417 --> 48:34.499
Oh my God.

48:34.500 --> 48:37.791
Saying that Minister of Justice
Rodrigo Lara Bonita

48:37.792 --> 48:42.041
has been assassinated only
minutes ago in Bogota.

48:42.042 --> 48:46.291
In an emergency release, the
President Belisario Betancur has

48:46.292 --> 48:49.541
called the minister's murder a
crime against humanity...

48:49.542 --> 48:53.292
- Mom, what's wrong?
- And insure the county in a stage of siege.

48:56.333 --> 49:01.500
We'll be back with more information as we compile
more facts about what happened. Thank you.

49:13.792 --> 49:16.707
The government takes on the mafia.

49:16.708 --> 49:21.416
President Betancur promises to
activate the extradition agreement.

49:21.417 --> 49:23.999
The corporation relocates.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.250
Where?

49:27.708 --> 49:29.458
Where they keep the money.

49:36.000 --> 49:39.416
The cartel proposes a negotiation
with the government.

49:39.417 --> 49:42.999
Which sends an ex-president
to hear Pablo's proposal.

49:43.000 --> 49:47.374
Which currently controls roughly about
80% of global traffic.

49:47.375 --> 49:53.082
We offer the repatriation of our capital
abroad to boost the national economy

49:53.083 --> 49:59.874
and also pay our country's external debt
presently estimated at $ 12 billion.

49:59.875 --> 50:03.666
In exchange, we request amnesty

50:03.667 --> 50:07.999
and the guarantee that under no
circumstances, no circumstances

50:08.000 --> 50:11.291
we will be extradited to another country

50:11.292 --> 50:16.083
for any illicit activities that
may have occur to date.

50:27.625 --> 50:32.291
You know things are very hard
over there after the minister.

50:32.292 --> 50:35.500
Yes, we were sorry to hear about that sir.

50:36.667 --> 50:39.374
Listen closely before we go on.

50:39.375 --> 50:42.374
Ex-President Michelsen
and myself are not here.

50:42.375 --> 50:45.749
The president of the country has
not authorized this meeting.

50:45.750 --> 50:49.749
- This isn't happening. Is that clear?
- A timely clarification.

50:49.750 --> 50:53.582
Imagine the very same way that my clients
are sitting at this table,

50:53.583 --> 50:57.292
representing third parties,
rather than their own.

50:58.917 --> 51:02.457
The extradition part
is non-negotiable.

51:02.458 --> 51:06.999
We can't guarantee anything without the
agreement of our North American partners.

51:07.000 --> 51:10.749
Ah, the North American
partners, their gringos. Who needs them?

51:10.750 --> 51:14.042
This is a matter between Colombians.

51:16.292 --> 51:18.292
Oh my God...

51:19.708 --> 51:23.457
You have to remove the extradition
treaty. Remove it.

51:23.458 --> 51:27.292
Go on tell your president,
the one you're not representing here.

51:29.292 --> 51:33.333
Yes, what's the other option? War.

51:34.208 --> 51:37.207
And we all know what war is about.

51:37.208 --> 51:41.875
The one who has more cash
wins it. And look at us.

51:42.500 --> 51:44.875
We have more cash here.

51:47.875 --> 51:50.832
Pablo couldn't keep his word.

51:50.833 --> 51:54.167
His daughter is born outside Colombia.

51:57.667 --> 52:02.207
He holds the people who drove him from
the country responsible.

52:02.208 --> 52:07.833
The editor of the newspaper that
published his past gets killed.

52:45.708 --> 52:47.542
Hello?

53:10.250 --> 53:13.416
You don't carry the present I
gave you Virginia. Where is it?

53:13.417 --> 53:16.666
I should have guessed when I
saw your boys downstairs.

53:16.667 --> 53:19.042
No, no my boys are not downtairs.

53:20.792 --> 53:22.374
Miss Virginia.

53:22.375 --> 53:26.833
You have so many agencies following you that
it's impossible to park on your street.

53:27.625 --> 53:30.250
I'm used to men following me.

53:38.208 --> 53:40.250
Or you are seeing someone else.

53:45.083 --> 53:47.999
Don't forget that I listen to
your conversations.

53:48.000 --> 53:51.041
You do? Then you've heard the threats?

53:51.042 --> 53:55.374
Since you've started killing
ministers, people keep calling me.

53:55.375 --> 53:58.582
They turn on chainsaws.
They play funeral marches for me.

53:58.583 --> 54:01.457
What happened to the
minister was entirely his fault.

54:01.458 --> 54:05.416
And what is going to happen to this country now
is the government's fault, this is not my fault.

54:05.417 --> 54:10.499
And now the gringos want to extradite me after
Lara's we have to stop that treaty no matter what.

54:10.500 --> 54:14.874
And those of us who are in the position to
be extradited, we are going send a message

54:14.875 --> 54:17.707
to the government, and to the
judges and to the journalists.

54:17.708 --> 54:20.624
It's gonna be fine.
It's gonna be fine

54:20.625 --> 54:23.124
- Pablo, you're losing your mind.
- Why?

54:23.125 --> 54:25.458
You don't listen to anyone.

54:27.417 --> 54:31.166
You think you can take
on everyone just by yourself.

54:31.167 --> 54:33.874
Your head is straight for suicide.

54:33.875 --> 54:38.250
You're coming with me.
You'll be my life poet if I remember.

54:38.792 --> 54:41.582
The one who will tell the story.

54:41.583 --> 54:45.083
To whom? There won't be
anyone left to hear it.

55:10.792 --> 55:13.457
Yes, but I can not let you in.

55:13.458 --> 55:18.082
No, I'm sorry.
I have received my orders.

55:18.083 --> 55:22.417
No wait. Take that away.
You got the wrong house.

55:23.167 --> 55:27.624
- Judge Carlos Alberto Alarcón?
- That's me.

55:27.625 --> 55:33.875
This is for you.
It's from Don Pablo Escobar Gaviria.

55:41.208 --> 55:44.166
What is it? For God's sake, help me!

55:44.167 --> 55:48.166
Pablo turn threating
people into its own genre.

55:48.167 --> 55:50.625
Help me! Oh my God!

55:51.250 --> 55:53.416
No no no!

55:53.417 --> 55:56.166
Only one thouseand million pesos! Only!

55:56.167 --> 55:58.874
They're insulting us. Motherfuckers.
No, no, no, no.

55:58.875 --> 56:01.999
This is what we'll we do. Hand more guns
in the slum. The more the better.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.875
2000 guns, 3000
guns, I don't care.

56:15.083 --> 56:18.750
Hail the boss!

56:19.042 --> 56:22.832
For every dead cop, I will pay $ 2,000!

56:22.833 --> 56:28.000
And for every sergeant
I will pay $ 5,000

56:30.000 --> 56:32.916
For a lieutenant
I will pay 10,000 dollars.

56:32.917 --> 56:35.499
For every cops, 20,000 dollars.

56:35.500 --> 56:38.875
For every major $ 50,000.

56:44.167 --> 56:49.583
You get paid very easily. You have to bring
the badge of the man they killed.

56:56.125 --> 56:58.374
We're going to kill you, you bitch!

56:58.375 --> 57:02.999
We will cut your face.
We'll wipe it off!

57:03.000 --> 57:06.999
We will kill you and your whole family!

57:07.000 --> 57:10.917
The law quickly sets it's exchange
rate in the slums.

57:31.708 --> 57:35.375
Ten executions for each
dead police officer.

57:36.333 --> 57:40.167
They see every teenage
boy as a future sicario.

57:40.417 --> 57:42.832
I'm not asking you. I'm ordering you.

57:42.833 --> 57:45.291
I'm giving you 24 hours
to do what I say

57:45.292 --> 57:49.291
Or, I will kill your mother, I will kill
your father, I will kill your grandmother.

57:49.292 --> 57:53.832
Soon, all of those dead, whether
killed by Pablo or his enemies

57:53.833 --> 57:56.291
will haunt me as well.

57:56.292 --> 57:58.749
Kill, soldier, kill!

57:58.750 --> 58:01.416
Death for God forgives!

58:01.417 --> 58:06.708
The Colombian government creates a special
unit exclusively for my boyfriend.

58:12.417 --> 58:15.582
There's 500 men here.
All from Bogota.

58:15.583 --> 58:19.457
Devoted only to capturing Pablo Escobar.

58:19.458 --> 58:21.832
We can't take anyone from here.

58:21.833 --> 58:25.333
Even bringing our own food
so they won't poison us.

58:26.042 --> 58:29.417
Why makes the DEA think we
need you here?

58:30.250 --> 58:33.041
Extradition treaty isn't working, is it?

58:33.042 --> 58:36.083
So if you don't send them up to us,
we come down and get them.

58:38.625 --> 58:40.082
Nice.

58:40.083 --> 58:44.291
Using three receivers on land
we can precisely calculate the signal

58:44.292 --> 58:46.874
in a 200-yard radius.

58:46.875 --> 58:52.874
If one of the posts detects well enough
information, it activates the protocol.

58:52.875 --> 58:58.458
Hit the switch, you'll hear a sound cue which will
inform your officer the the recording is in progress.

58:59.042 --> 59:02.624
Sir! Escobar!
He's in Sector 2, La Victoria.

59:02.625 --> 59:04.124
It's a mobile line Sir.

59:04.125 --> 59:09.166
The DEA set up sophisticated
tracking systems to pinpoint Pablo.

59:09.167 --> 59:12.666
Escobar! He's coming lunch at El Dorado.
It's a public phone.

59:12.667 --> 59:15.041
- Sector 7, La Estrella.
- It's on the other side of town.

59:15.042 --> 59:18.375
- Escobar! At the battle, sir.
- Escobar!

59:23.125 --> 59:25.000
Is he everywhere?

59:26.083 --> 59:30.541
They didn't take into account on the
local people's astuteness.

59:30.542 --> 59:35.791
I saw Pablo on the corner
of Bolivar Avenue.

59:35.792 --> 59:40.000
Listen carefully.
Yesterday at 7th and Independencia.

59:52.708 --> 59:55.875
Nothing lasts forever, Virginia.

59:56.875 --> 01:00:00.957
You know we have new partners and
they have requested changes.

01:00:00.958 --> 01:00:06.332
And your replacement, she has
the right people behind her.

01:00:06.333 --> 01:00:10.207
Who she fucks is not the
problem, it's who I fuck.

01:00:10.208 --> 01:00:12.374
Don't turn this around, Virginia.

01:00:12.375 --> 01:00:15.707
We don't care what you do
in your personal life here.

01:00:15.708 --> 01:00:18.374
They told you to fire me.

01:00:18.375 --> 01:00:23.166
Nobody told me to do anything.
It's an artistic decision.

01:00:23.167 --> 01:00:27.417
Replacing me with that cheap whore
is an artistic decision? Since when?

01:00:29.458 --> 01:00:31.832
Say it. Just say it.

01:00:31.833 --> 01:00:34.541
This is because of him. Say it.

01:00:34.542 --> 01:00:35.916
Say it!

01:00:35.917 --> 01:00:41.707
We don't care what that gentleman
lover of yours does for a living.

01:00:41.708 --> 01:00:43.249
No?

01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:47.417
You might care from now on,
you motherfucker. Garbage.

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:53.207
And you better watch out!

01:00:53.208 --> 01:00:57.332
Cause I'm gonna tell Pablo to blow your fucking
building with you and your family inside!

01:00:57.333 --> 01:00:58.874
Motherfucker!

01:00:58.875 --> 01:01:01.667
And that's gonna be
an artistic decision too!

01:01:22.583 --> 01:01:24.833
What's wrong with men?

01:01:26.167 --> 01:01:30.208
Nobody ever told you that if you want to see
a woman, you're supposed to call first?

01:01:35.292 --> 01:01:38.167
Don't show me your badge. I accept.

01:01:39.875 --> 01:01:42.083
That's good news then?

01:01:42.542 --> 01:01:46.124
Great news.
TV networks are like men.

01:01:46.125 --> 01:01:49.250
Sometimes you have to leave them
to be appreciated.

01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:53.208
So what's your plan?

01:01:54.708 --> 01:01:58.332
I have an offer from my network in Florida.
I might take.

01:01:58.333 --> 01:02:00.417
Start a new life.

01:02:04.042 --> 01:02:05.667
But I would need a man.

01:02:10.125 --> 01:02:12.875
Are you still married, Agent Shepard?

01:02:18.875 --> 01:02:22.292
Until you've made love to a
Colombian woman...

01:02:24.208 --> 01:02:26.792
That changes everything.

01:02:33.292 --> 01:02:36.125
Please don't put my life
in danger, Virginia.

01:02:37.708 --> 01:02:40.833
Pablo doesn't need an excuse
to kill a DEA agent.

01:02:48.667 --> 01:02:51.292
I'll take you with him when he goes down.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.542
You know that, don't you?

01:02:57.375 --> 01:03:02.332
Virginia, you were fired by the network.

01:03:02.333 --> 01:03:05.207
And you don't have any offers.
No one will hire you.

01:03:05.208 --> 01:03:07.999
Not here. Not in Miami. Nowhere.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.582
You're marked for life.

01:03:10.583 --> 01:03:14.375
So you have to find something else to tell.
Anything.

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:17.832
And you're not 20 anymore.

01:03:17.833 --> 01:03:22.125
Your legs are not as pretty
as they used to be, or your smile.

01:03:31.125 --> 01:03:34.082
- What do you propose?
- Help us.

01:03:34.083 --> 01:03:37.458
- In exchange for what?
- Protection.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.458
Protection? There is no such thing.

01:03:40.875 --> 01:03:43.583
Pablo will find me no matter where I go.

01:03:44.875 --> 01:03:47.250
You think he doesn't scare me?

01:03:47.875 --> 01:03:53.374
You think all the threats, and death and
smell of burned flesh don't affect me?

01:03:53.375 --> 01:03:55.542
Help us find him.

01:04:02.333 --> 01:04:04.250
You know what?

01:04:06.208 --> 01:04:10.082
The TV networks only want
little girls now.

01:04:10.083 --> 01:04:13.042
They don't value
the experience of a woman.

01:04:13.875 --> 01:04:16.916
Is that what Pablo values in you?

01:04:16.917 --> 01:04:20.250
Esactly. And my loyalty.

01:04:22.750 --> 01:04:24.708
The bill has been paid.

01:04:31.125 --> 01:04:32.917
Wait here.

01:04:59.083 --> 01:05:02.292
No no no no. Listen to me.

01:05:03.083 --> 01:05:04.958
Tell me what does
that gringo want?

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.624
What all the gringos
want Pablo: to catch you.

01:05:07.625 --> 01:05:10.499
- Motherfucker. Is he staying in Medellin?
- Are you following me?

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:14.291
No, I'm not following you, What if I'm following
you do you have something to hide Virginia?

01:05:14.292 --> 01:05:17.707
Pablo, don't follow me and
don't call me anymore, okay?

01:05:17.708 --> 01:05:22.124
You're ruining my life!

01:05:22.125 --> 01:05:24.957
You are ruining my life
You know that I got fired because of you.

01:05:24.958 --> 01:05:28.499
People keep avoiding me like the plague.
Nobody will come near me.

01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:33.082
- Well that Gringo have no problem coming near you.
- Stop talking about him and listen!

01:05:33.083 --> 01:05:37.582
Stay away from me, I beg you!
Stay away!

01:05:37.583 --> 01:05:39.916
You're saying that because you
know they are recording this.

01:05:39.917 --> 01:05:41.833
And you want them to think
it is over between us!

01:05:41.917 --> 01:05:46.125
It is over between us!
Hear it, it is over!

01:05:46.792 --> 01:05:49.999
If anyone's out there listening,
please record this!

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:54.082
I have nothing to do with the psychopathic
killer on the other side of the line!

01:05:54.083 --> 01:05:56.750
I'll call you back. I'll call you back.

01:05:57.958 --> 01:06:00.499
That bitch is really angry.

01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:06.875
- Do you like birds?
- See, they represent freedom.

01:06:08.375 --> 01:06:12.374
Pablo's lovers:
Teenage girls from poor neighborhoods

01:06:12.375 --> 01:06:16.292
handed over by their
families for a few thousand pesos.

01:06:17.708 --> 01:06:22.332
It isn't easy sleeping with the most wanted
man in Colombia and keeping it a secret.

01:06:22.333 --> 01:06:24.750
Believe me, I know.

01:06:26.292 --> 01:06:30.958
It just takes one of them to talk
to have the search bloc find him

01:07:17.375 --> 01:07:22.833
Helicopters! Helicopters!

01:07:27.333 --> 01:07:30.416
Helicopters!

01:07:30.417 --> 01:07:33.417
Oh my God!

01:07:35.458 --> 01:07:40.541
Come on, Pelao! Hurry up!

01:07:40.542 --> 01:07:43.833
The birds! Release the birds!

01:08:47.832 --> 01:08:51.999
Listen, I need to reach Pablo. Our
people in Miami are getting out of line.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.957
The routes are falling apart and the
Cali cartel is getting all territory.

01:08:55.957 --> 01:09:00.417
We can't finance this war if the business
stops working. Do you understand?

01:09:06.042 --> 01:09:09.624
No, no, no, you son of a bitch.
I don't want you to kill them.

01:09:09.625 --> 01:09:14.207
I just want you to find Pablo. Is that
difficult to understand? Could you...

01:09:19.125 --> 01:09:23.667
Monje's death meant the fall
of the cartel's financial wing.

01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:34.292
Garza's death meant the fall
of the toughest wing.

01:09:46.207 --> 01:09:48.957
Pablo loses his strong men.

01:09:48.957 --> 01:09:52.249
From this point on, he can only run.

01:09:52.250 --> 01:09:55.999
For years we have fought for
peace, but the only response we've gotten

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:01.249
has been a viscious and systematic persecution
against our families and organizations.

01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:06.332
That's why, I declare full out war on the
government and the political establishment.

01:10:06.333 --> 01:10:09.082
If they make me run,
I'll make them run too.

01:10:09.083 --> 01:10:12.124
See, terrorism is the
atomic bomb of the poor.

01:10:12.125 --> 01:10:17.333
We're not using lead anymore.
No, no no, from now on we're usng dynamite.

01:10:17.958 --> 01:10:23.041
And how do we know that you are
really Pablo Escobar Gaviria

01:10:23.042 --> 01:10:26.082
and not someone else pretending to be him.

01:10:26.083 --> 01:10:30.666
That is very easy. I will prove it to you
by killing you and your family tonight

01:10:30.667 --> 01:10:35.082
and blowing up your radio station.
What do you think? Would that be enough?

01:10:35.083 --> 01:10:36.542
Hey?

01:10:37.417 --> 01:10:39.332
You're a celebtrity in
your country, Virginia.

01:10:39.333 --> 01:10:43.208
What's so appealing about coming
to Miami to host a TV show?

01:10:44.375 --> 01:10:46.125
Well...

01:10:46.708 --> 01:10:50.749
I don't really think I have
anything else to prove in Colombia.

01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:52.541
No?

01:10:52.542 --> 01:10:58.582
But, I guess what appeals to me is
the challenge.

01:10:58.583 --> 01:11:02.458
The excitement of a new adventure.

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:09.250
Also, there are some very attractive
men in this part of the world.

01:11:10.667 --> 01:11:13.542
Tell us Virginia, what's the last show
you hosted on Colombian TV?

01:11:24.917 --> 01:11:28.082
How you doing? FBI.

01:11:28.083 --> 01:11:30.708
Mind if we take a look at your passport?

01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:35.458
Thank you.

01:11:38.042 --> 01:11:40.874
Do you carry any money?

01:11:40.875 --> 01:11:44.250
My ex isn't using me as a mule, yet.

01:11:45.625 --> 01:11:47.166
Okay.

01:11:47.167 --> 01:11:49.042
Oh my God!

01:11:59.125 --> 01:12:02.332
- What happened?
- I'm sorry. They just closed Bogota airport.

01:12:02.333 --> 01:12:04.124
- Why?
- I'll call you back.

01:12:04.125 --> 01:12:07.292
An Avianca plane
exploded in mid-flight.

01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:25.042
After the first bombs, the country asked
the government to give Pablo hell.

01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:29.917
Look at the little thing.

01:12:31.042 --> 01:12:33.125
This one is also nice.

01:12:37.208 --> 01:12:40.124
I like this too.
They are beautiful.

01:12:40.125 --> 01:12:42.958
Look at this dear? This...

01:12:43.625 --> 01:12:46.582
Do you like it? Yes?

01:12:46.583 --> 01:12:52.125
After a dozen bombs, the country begs
the government to give Pablo what he wants.

01:13:00.625 --> 01:13:02.707
Hurry up!

01:13:02.708 --> 01:13:05.250
In the car, boss. Hurry up!

01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:10.667
Pablo! Pablo, come on! Pablo!

01:13:27.333 --> 01:13:29.417
Newell.

01:13:30.333 --> 01:13:33.541
There's a Newell in my graduating class.

01:13:33.542 --> 01:13:35.874
Do you think it could be him?

01:13:35.875 --> 01:13:39.125
- What is it?
- List of victims on the Avianca flight.

01:13:40.167 --> 01:13:43.833
107 people on board.
They just sent it.

01:13:46.125 --> 01:13:49.332
Robin Newell and Catherine Gilmore.

01:13:49.333 --> 01:13:53.208
35 and 32 years old. Married.

01:14:02.167 --> 01:14:04.792
Sir? Sir, wait.

01:14:05.458 --> 01:14:07.041
Sir!
Ambassador.

01:14:07.042 --> 01:14:10.166
There were two Americans on the
Avianca flight. So listen:

01:14:10.167 --> 01:14:15.332
Directive 12.333 authorizes
military operations in foreign countries

01:14:15.333 --> 01:14:18.166
- to guarantee the security of American citizens.
- Thank you Sara.

01:14:18.167 --> 01:14:20.957
Agent Shepard, I'm sure you know
Mr. Velarde.

01:14:20.958 --> 01:14:24.832
He is also the man in charge of negotiating
the surrender of Pablo Escobar.

01:14:24.833 --> 01:14:29.667
This is Mr. Castro.
He is Mr. Escobar's legal representative.

01:14:31.125 --> 01:14:34.583
He agreed to turn himself in
to the authorities.

01:14:36.208 --> 01:14:38.500
In exchange for what?

01:14:43.042 --> 01:14:48.624
By revoking the extradition treaty, our
judges and magistrates have taught the world

01:14:48.625 --> 01:14:52.332
a lesson in sovereignty,
independence and patriotism.

01:14:52.333 --> 01:14:54.333
After years of persecution...

01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:49.999
Pablo has one last condition
to his surrender.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.333
He provides the prison.

01:15:55.833 --> 01:15:59.167
It's very pretty, isn't it?

01:16:09.083 --> 01:16:13.041
He cedes a property to the
municipality through a frontman

01:16:13.042 --> 01:16:15.625
so they can build it there.

01:16:32.792 --> 01:16:36.541
Hey, everyone's here but the president.

01:16:36.542 --> 01:16:39.375
He couldn't make it.
Scheduling problems.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.874
Without the threat of extradition
hanging over him

01:16:45.875 --> 01:16:49.500
Pablo needs a safe place to
reorganize his business.

01:16:50.042 --> 01:16:52.416
For peace in Colombia.

01:16:52.417 --> 01:16:55.708
And the government provide him with one.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.041
The routes through Conception and
Norman Key are working again.

01:17:00.042 --> 01:17:04.082
The Fany is at almost 100%.

01:17:04.083 --> 01:17:09.791
We have 250 planes in service and
35 pipelines mobilized in Santamarca.

01:17:09.792 --> 01:17:13.957
Are you talking to the number 2
at the Aviation Authority?

01:17:13.958 --> 01:17:19.208
Talk to him, he's his brother. If he doesn't want to
play golf, we bring him here and I'll talk to him.

01:17:21.792 --> 01:17:25.166
A request for everyone
who's still outside...

01:17:25.167 --> 01:17:28.999
Nobody moves around without me knowing it.
Nobody. It's a deal.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:33.749
And they have to pay the
taxes that they owe me.

01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:37.374
- It's 20%.
- 20%? - 20%

01:17:37.375 --> 01:17:41.874
They will like that, Pablo?
The cali people are asking for 5%.

01:17:41.875 --> 01:17:44.999
Everyone will go to them and then say OK.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.958
How do you know that?
Have you talked to them?

01:17:55.375 --> 01:17:58.541
- What are you saying, Pablo?
- No, no, no, listen to me.

01:17:58.542 --> 01:18:03.374
If you prefer those fits from
Cali, go to them and try your luck.

01:18:03.375 --> 01:18:04.917
I came up with the roads.

01:18:04.958 --> 01:18:08.791
I took out extradition all by
myself so you can keep working.

01:18:08.792 --> 01:18:13.124
So make everybody knows that the one who doesn't
pay with cash, merchandise, or properties

01:18:13.125 --> 01:18:16.666
will pay with his life.
Do you hear what I say?

01:18:16.667 --> 01:18:19.625
- Did you hear me?
- Yes, sir.

01:18:20.208 --> 01:18:22.417
What's next?

01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:27.458
Soccer players from the professional league
come to play with the traffickers.

01:18:36.167 --> 01:18:39.374
For God's sake, my brother!

01:18:39.375 --> 01:18:43.458
And the match isn't over
until the boss wins.

01:18:48.208 --> 01:18:53.083
Gentlemen! The social workers have arrived!

01:19:22.750 --> 01:19:25.250
Go on, go on.

01:19:31.958 --> 01:19:35.000
Sundays are saved for family.

01:19:46.875 --> 01:19:48.667
My Beloved!

01:19:49.250 --> 01:19:51.042
How are you?

01:20:00.250 --> 01:20:03.333
Why don't you live with us home, Daddy?

01:20:04.958 --> 01:20:09.041
Because I work here, Princess.

01:20:09.042 --> 01:20:11.333
My princess.

01:20:13.042 --> 01:20:15.667
This is my castle.

01:20:16.458 --> 01:20:20.167
Do you see those towers there?
Those are my towers.

01:20:21.125 --> 01:20:24.250
I am a king.
King has castles.

01:20:26.083 --> 01:20:30.124
And that's why you are a princess,
because you are my daughter.

01:20:30.125 --> 01:20:33.166
But there are guards.
Of course there are

01:20:33.167 --> 01:20:35.917
They are here to protect me.

01:20:37.583 --> 01:20:41.750
Mommy says you can't leave
and she cries all the time.

01:20:42.625 --> 01:20:45.749
What do you mean I can't leave?

01:20:45.750 --> 01:20:48.666
- Who says that?
- Mommy.

01:20:48.667 --> 01:20:50.458
Really?

01:20:52.292 --> 01:20:58.875
No, my dear. This is my castle.
I can come and go as I please.

01:21:01.792 --> 01:21:03.666
You want to see that?

01:21:03.667 --> 01:21:07.417
You want to go out for an ice cream?

01:21:08.208 --> 01:21:13.416
Where is the place that...
The big park near the church.

01:21:13.417 --> 01:21:15.542
That's the one you like.

01:21:16.958 --> 01:21:20.292
Let's go. Let's go.

01:21:24.167 --> 01:21:27.917
What do you had for lunch? Oh my God.

01:21:32.542 --> 01:21:36.291
Don't wait for us. Manuela and I
are going out for an ice cream.

01:21:36.292 --> 01:21:39.625
Pablito still has his humor.

01:21:48.833 --> 01:21:51.208
- Hello Hello.
- Boss.

01:21:51.917 --> 01:21:56.875
Who's in charge of this castle?
Who's the boss here?

01:21:57.292 --> 01:21:58.042
You, boss.

01:21:58.083 --> 01:22:00.374
See that's what I like to hear.
Open the door.

01:22:00.375 --> 01:22:01.958
Open the door!

01:22:02.875 --> 01:22:04.750
Open it.

01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:13.832
The king and his princess are going out
for an ice cream. What flavor you want?

01:22:13.833 --> 01:22:18.041
- Strawberry.
- Strawberry! The princess has a carriage.

01:22:18.042 --> 01:22:21.291
If you dare to stop us, the
king will cut your heads off.

01:22:21.292 --> 01:22:23.542
Open the door. Open the door.

01:22:30.625 --> 01:22:33.707
Look, our carriage is waiting for us.

01:22:33.708 --> 01:22:38.292
How nice. Give me the
keys, give me the keys.

01:22:38.833 --> 01:22:42.624
The king is asking for the keys
of the carriage. Give me the keys.

01:22:42.625 --> 01:22:45.833
Do not move an inch! Stop!

01:23:04.417 --> 01:23:06.042
Pablo!

01:23:10.250 --> 01:23:11.792
Pablo!

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.875
I forgot to tell you, my princess...

01:23:35.208 --> 01:23:42.875
that I can bring the best ice cream strawberry
ice cream of the world there for you

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:50.874
Strawberry ice cream just made with ice from the
North Pole which is specially for my daughter,

01:23:50.875 --> 01:23:55.374
my princess, especially,
the best one in the world

01:23:55.375 --> 01:23:58.499
- For you
- Really?

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:02.583
Have you heard of the strawberry iceberg
from North Pole? They're very famous.

01:24:03.083 --> 01:24:05.666
Not only has the media banned me...

01:24:05.667 --> 01:24:08.749
My advertising contracts
are also cancelled.

01:24:08.750 --> 01:24:12.416
Which forces me to sell my
home to pay my debts.

01:24:12.417 --> 01:24:14.707
Be careful with that!

01:24:14.708 --> 01:24:19.916
What you just moved with your foot is
a very expensive piece of Indonesian art.

01:24:19.917 --> 01:24:24.917
I'm not asking you to use your head.
Using your hands will be enough.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.624
I rent an apartment at El Nogal,
where a former First Lady lives.

01:24:30.625 --> 01:24:34.083
Hoping her bodyguards
will keep an eye on me as well.

01:24:35.375 --> 01:24:37.250
How are you boys?

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.833
Fine. Thanks.

01:24:42.250 --> 01:24:45.333
And I get a break from
the telephone threats.

01:24:48.833 --> 01:24:50.667
All set ma'am.

01:24:55.958 --> 01:24:58.749
Was it a new number?

01:24:58.750 --> 01:25:01.125
But not for long.

01:25:43.083 --> 01:25:46.083
- Oh blessed!
- Hello.

01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:49.874
Nice hotel.

01:25:49.875 --> 01:25:53.416
- How's our book going?
- What book?

01:25:53.417 --> 01:25:56.999
- Who would want to read a book about you?
- Ay, my admirers.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.374
Your admirers can't read.
They are too young.

01:25:59.375 --> 01:26:01.041
That's true. That's one of their virtues.

01:26:01.042 --> 01:26:05.125
You know that I left a meeting to see you?
So what do you want? Tell me.

01:26:08.083 --> 01:26:11.874
I need to know if I'm safe.

01:26:11.875 --> 01:26:15.666
How would I know that?
No one is saving this country.

01:26:15.667 --> 01:26:19.500
As far as you're concerned,
can I feel safe?

01:26:20.458 --> 01:26:25.542
Ay, no! Nobody would kill their
own biographer. Don't worry.

01:26:26.167 --> 01:26:27.875
Relax.

01:26:28.417 --> 01:26:30.333
What else?

01:26:32.292 --> 01:26:34.333
Oh, Pablo.

01:26:35.375 --> 01:26:39.457
You can't imagine how terrifying
my life has become.

01:26:39.458 --> 01:26:42.999
My phone won't stop ringing.
Threats, everyday threats.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.957
You have an army of men to protect
you, but who protects me?

01:26:46.958 --> 01:26:50.750
- What about me?
- What can I do?

01:26:54.250 --> 01:26:58.625
I need you tell everyone
we're not together anymore.

01:27:01.333 --> 01:27:03.250
You're breaking my heart.

01:27:03.833 --> 01:27:07.416
After all I have done for you?

01:27:07.417 --> 01:27:10.124
What have you done for me? Nothing!

01:27:10.125 --> 01:27:13.374
I already had a career when I met you.
Don't forget that.

01:27:13.375 --> 01:27:18.124
And I'm the only woman who has loved you
without expecting anything in return.

01:27:18.125 --> 01:27:21.166
- And that includes your wife.
- No no no no.

01:27:21.167 --> 01:27:22.957
Don't you ever dare to
compare to my wife.

01:27:22.958 --> 01:27:24.999
Don't even put the name
of Victoria on your list.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.291
She was with me when I
didn't have a peso.

01:27:27.292 --> 01:27:29.000
Would you have
notice me back then?

01:27:29.042 --> 01:27:32.374
With no planes, no travel and no
shopping in New York? Would you have?

01:27:32.375 --> 01:27:36.375
Tell me no, would you?
I don't think so.

01:27:37.708 --> 01:27:42.499
I'm broke, Pablo. I'm broke. My
career is over because of you.

01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:45.499
Nobody will hire me
anymore, because of you!

01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:48.292
- So you need to help me!
- With how? What do you need?

01:27:48.708 --> 01:27:50.500
Tell me.

01:27:51.917 --> 01:27:54.667
What do you need, Virginia?

01:27:56.542 --> 01:28:00.167
$ 80,000, to go to Europe.

01:28:01.417 --> 01:28:04.582
$ 80,000, that's a lot of money.

01:28:04.583 --> 01:28:07.791
Please, 80,000 dollars.

01:28:07.792 --> 01:28:11.708
I don't have that money.
No I don't.

01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:15.167
And you are my biographer
you have to stay here.

01:28:21.708 --> 01:28:25.166
I've seen things, Pablo.
I've seen things.

01:28:25.167 --> 01:28:27.832
- While I was with you.
- You've seen what?

01:28:27.833 --> 01:28:30.666
Things that implicate a lot of people.

01:28:30.667 --> 01:28:33.625
If I wanted to talk...

01:28:37.375 --> 01:28:39.333
If you what?

01:28:40.083 --> 01:28:43.499
- No no no!
- I never expected it from you, really?

01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:46.332
Oh my God, that was not what I mean.

01:28:46.333 --> 01:28:48.874
Pablo, I would never betray you.

01:28:48.875 --> 01:28:53.207
It's it that I'm desperate.
I don't even know what I'm saying anymore.

01:28:53.208 --> 01:28:55.707
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:28:55.708 --> 01:28:58.624
Come here. Give me a hug.

01:28:58.625 --> 01:29:03.249
Don't worry. Don't worry.
I will take care of you.

01:29:03.250 --> 01:29:07.833
I will protect you and make
sure you have a long life.

01:29:09.667 --> 01:29:11.417
Because you know what?

01:29:12.250 --> 01:29:14.292
I have one news for you.

01:29:15.250 --> 01:29:19.374
Nobody will get near you because
they will be afraid that I will kill them.

01:29:19.375 --> 01:29:23.125
So your life will be full of shit!

01:29:26.083 --> 01:29:27.958
Slut.

01:30:03.167 --> 01:30:05.125
What a clown.

01:30:06.375 --> 01:30:11.000
You, Pablo, things are getting
rough every month.

01:30:12.167 --> 01:30:14.916
Business, business isn't good.

01:30:14.917 --> 01:30:17.625
No, they're not good.

01:30:18.333 --> 01:30:20.125
My lord

01:30:22.167 --> 01:30:25.749
Just one question. One question.

01:30:25.750 --> 01:30:28.874
The Fany route moves, what?

01:30:28.875 --> 01:30:31.625
- 10 kilos a month?
- Yes.

01:30:32.583 --> 01:30:37.499
And you pay me what? 50000? 50000.

01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:41.499
Yes, but Pablo, the Fany route failed twice
this month.

01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:44.499
We lost two 600 kilos shipments.

01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:49.082
We have to pay the owners,
hire lawyers for the pilots.

01:30:49.083 --> 01:30:54.000
Easy, but the deal was 250, no?
I gave you that route remember?

01:30:56.583 --> 01:31:00.791
Listen to me, mate. 250
is impossible Pablo.

01:31:00.792 --> 01:31:03.250
It's impossible. I mean it.

01:31:10.875 --> 01:31:14.874
Trust us.
We're your partners, son of a bitch.

01:31:14.875 --> 01:31:18.250
We've been together from the start.
Yes, Pablo?

01:31:19.625 --> 01:31:22.416
But we are not in this together.
I'm here and you're out.

01:31:22.417 --> 01:31:26.250
We know the out, Pablo.
Who do you think we are?

01:31:27.833 --> 01:31:31.583
But you have to pay me the tax so...

01:31:34.625 --> 01:31:36.208
You have to.

01:31:37.042 --> 01:31:40.208
Either you pay it, or
I double it right now.

01:31:44.500 --> 01:31:47.499
We have to discuss it
with the other families.

01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:51.082
Listen, Pablo. Business has changed a lot.

01:31:51.083 --> 01:31:53.957
Things aren't the same
they used to be anymore.

01:31:53.958 --> 01:31:57.000
50,000 should be
enough, it's simple.

01:32:01.958 --> 01:32:06.166
"50,000 should be
enough, that simple."

01:32:06.167 --> 01:32:08.208
So you come here...

01:32:09.167 --> 01:32:15.250
to sit down in front of me with that
gold and those fancy clothes?

01:32:16.250 --> 01:32:19.457
You're all getting rich out there
while I'm here. No, no, no, Pablo."

01:32:19.458 --> 01:32:21.749
And you are flirting with
the Cali people.

01:32:21.750 --> 01:32:23.582
And to top it up you don't
even want to pay me.

01:32:23.583 --> 01:32:27.250
Pablo, what's up?
No, Pablo, it's not.

01:32:27.917 --> 01:32:29.708
What are you doing?

01:32:31.583 --> 01:32:34.500
Let me go! Let me go!

01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:00.291
Don't complain. You are already dead.
This is just a formality.

01:33:00.292 --> 01:33:01.749
Do it.

01:33:01.750 --> 01:33:05.166
- Pablo, do not kill me like this!
- You are men, your pigs!

01:33:05.167 --> 01:33:09.124
This is where your families can
put your pieces back together.

01:33:09.125 --> 01:33:12.042
Show gratitude, you freaks.
Give me his arm

01:33:25.750 --> 01:33:28.416
The murders of La Catedral
reached the media

01:33:28.417 --> 01:33:31.250
and made the
government an accomplice.

01:33:32.333 --> 01:33:35.124
Its' credibility is at stake.

01:33:35.125 --> 01:33:38.333
They decide to transfer Pablo
to a military prison.

01:33:41.292 --> 01:33:43.916
Forward, Forward!

01:33:43.917 --> 01:33:46.250
Left flank, keep your eyes open!

01:34:00.333 --> 01:34:03.249
The fence of the prison was electric

01:34:03.250 --> 01:34:06.708
But the switch was in Pablo's room.

01:34:19.042 --> 01:34:22.291
Our people are turning on us, boss.

01:34:22.292 --> 01:34:24.999
Apparently, they are thinking:

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:29.000
"If he did that to Santoro and
Hermosilla, why won't he do it to us?"

01:34:29.833 --> 01:34:32.249
Damn bitches

01:34:32.250 --> 01:34:34.958
Burn it like a chicken
straight to Cali.

01:34:40.167 --> 01:34:43.500
What, do you think that was a mistake?

01:34:47.583 --> 01:34:50.167
Sure it was.

01:34:53.083 --> 01:34:55.957
Pablo's ex-associates
cooperate with the government

01:34:55.958 --> 01:34:58.750
in exchange for having their
records cleared

01:35:02.708 --> 01:35:06.125
Dozens of narcos willing
to fight him are released.

01:35:09.583 --> 01:35:11.708
To the airport.

01:35:17.875 --> 01:35:23.333
Son, say goodbye.
This is not our country, it's a mass grave.

01:35:27.167 --> 01:35:31.083
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Who are you? What
the fuck do you want?

01:35:37.583 --> 01:35:42.791
Pablo's enemies, members of rival
cartels and paramilitary groups,

01:35:42.792 --> 01:35:48.582
together with government security forces
supported by the DEA and the CIA

01:35:48.583 --> 01:35:52.292
form the most lethal hunting
party of all time.

01:35:53.208 --> 01:36:00.667
"For working with Pablo Escobar."

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:07.832
The bodies of Pablo's lawyers,
hitman, accountants and family

01:36:07.833 --> 01:36:11.625
appears scattered
all over Medellin.

01:36:36.167 --> 01:36:40.833
Anyone who's ever been close to him,
becomes a target.

01:36:59.250 --> 01:37:02.083
Good morning, can I help you?
Good morning.

01:37:07.333 --> 01:37:10.417
These belonged to European royalty.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.125
And these earrings...

01:37:15.792 --> 01:37:18.291
If you give me a good price,
I'll bring you more

01:37:18.292 --> 01:37:20.083
Right. let me have a look.

01:37:21.250 --> 01:37:22.958
Exquisite.

01:37:28.875 --> 01:37:30.874
- Don't open the door.
- Do you know him?

01:37:30.875 --> 01:37:32.083
No.

01:37:33.500 --> 01:37:36.167
Call the police.
Call the police.

01:37:42.542 --> 01:37:45.832
- Call the police.
- I'm sorry.

01:37:45.833 --> 01:37:48.207
- No, what are you doing?
- I don't want any trouble.

01:37:48.208 --> 01:37:51.457
Let me in!

01:37:51.458 --> 01:37:53.542
Let me in!

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.542
Let me in!

01:38:05.167 --> 01:38:06.917
No!

01:39:31.083 --> 01:39:33.583
I'm going to be a star.

01:39:34.042 --> 01:39:35.250
Look.

01:39:37.667 --> 01:39:42.125
Victoria, do you hear that? Manuela wants
to be a star in a Christmas show.

01:39:44.875 --> 01:39:47.000
Will you come and see me?

01:39:48.250 --> 01:39:50.624
Yes I will.

01:39:50.625 --> 01:39:53.833
Mommy made me a shiny costume.

01:39:57.250 --> 01:40:00.042
I'm sure you're beautiful in it.

01:40:01.333 --> 01:40:06.250
Victoria, what happened?
Don't cry, don't cry.

01:40:09.042 --> 01:40:11.458
- She won't be in the show.
- What?

01:40:12.375 --> 01:40:13.917
Why?

01:40:14.625 --> 01:40:18.792
The parents of the other children objected.
They held an assembly.

01:40:19.625 --> 01:40:22.208
- She doesn't know yet.
- Why?

01:40:23.750 --> 01:40:25.292
Why?

01:40:25.792 --> 01:40:29.416
Because they are afraid your enemies
will blow up the school, Pablo, that's why.

01:40:29.417 --> 01:40:33.125
- They are scared.
- Son of a bitch.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.667
Son of a bitch

01:40:40.958 --> 01:40:42.833
Give me your hand.

01:40:44.375 --> 01:40:50.416
I need you to take the kids, get in a plane
and get out of this country.

01:40:50.417 --> 01:40:54.416
It's getting very
dangerous for you here.

01:40:54.417 --> 01:40:57.500
You can't stay here. You can't.

01:40:58.458 --> 01:41:03.292
So once you leave,
I can take care of things.

01:41:04.333 --> 01:41:07.457
You didn't keep your promise, Pablo.

01:41:07.458 --> 01:41:09.999
You promised me everything would be fine.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:13.291
That my children will have a normal life.

01:41:13.292 --> 01:41:16.083
Does this seem like a normal life to you?

01:41:43.083 --> 01:41:45.457
There's a woman out here.
She wants to talk to you.

01:41:45.458 --> 01:41:49.292
- What's her name?
- I don't know. She got mad at me when I asked.

01:41:50.542 --> 01:41:52.875
She says she's famous around here.

01:42:12.833 --> 01:42:17.124
He needs to get his family out of the
country. They can not stay here.

01:42:17.125 --> 01:42:20.291
They will reach them in America,
so they have to go to Europe.

01:42:20.292 --> 01:42:24.166
And as soon as they are out,
he'll feel free to destroy everything.

01:42:24.167 --> 01:42:26.166
So you cannot let them leave

01:42:26.167 --> 01:42:29.292
As long as they are here,
he'll be busy trying to protect them.

01:42:30.250 --> 01:42:33.041
You better trust me.
You can't let them leave.

01:42:33.042 --> 01:42:36.624
This is his weak spot, his
family, his family, his family.

01:42:36.625 --> 01:42:39.375
It's all he cares about, nothing else.

01:42:40.042 --> 01:42:45.667
- And you know that first hand, don't you?
- No... You have no idea.

01:42:46.458 --> 01:42:48.707
We can't do that.

01:42:48.708 --> 01:42:51.874
The attorney general
is the one getting them out of the country.

01:42:51.875 --> 01:42:55.832
They made a deal. Once they're out,
Pablo Escobar will turn himself in.

01:42:55.833 --> 01:42:58.999
Break your word. Just put some pressure
on the German Chancellor.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:04.499
They land in Cologne in two hours.
Do not let them get off that plane

01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:07.749
- There's no legal reason they can't travel to Germany.
- Bring them back.

01:43:07.750 --> 01:43:11.166
The family is bait.
We need them alive and at home.

01:43:11.167 --> 01:43:13.624
Put them some place, we sit
and we wait.

01:43:13.625 --> 01:43:17.667
Pablo will try to talk to them, right?
When that happens, we'll be ready.

01:43:23.083 --> 01:43:25.583
Pablo Escobar Gaviria's
family was greeted

01:43:25.625 --> 01:43:29.707
by a strong security presence upon
arrival in Bogota this morning

01:43:29.708 --> 01:43:32.582
after being denied entry into Germany.

01:43:32.583 --> 01:43:37.666
His wife and children of the were forced to
spend the night in the Cologne Airport

01:43:37.667 --> 01:43:41.124
and later sent back to Colombia on
a regular flight in the morning.

01:43:41.125 --> 01:43:44.874
The bastards have taken
my family hostage!

01:43:44.875 --> 01:43:48.707
Bastards!

01:43:48.708 --> 01:43:51.832
The German government has denied clemency
position the family requested upon arrival.

01:43:51.833 --> 01:43:56.124
The army has cordoned off the apartment
building where they are staying.

01:43:56.125 --> 01:44:01.917
The operation has been joined by men
from the Fiscalía and the search squad.

01:44:03.333 --> 01:44:06.500
Juan Pablo, please turn it off.

01:44:07.292 --> 01:44:09.916
Do you need anything else?

01:44:09.917 --> 01:44:12.208
No. Thank you.

01:44:17.292 --> 01:44:19.042
Pablo!

01:44:26.208 --> 01:44:29.083
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome

01:45:11.917 --> 01:45:15.208
You should ask if
anyone wanted anything.

01:45:25.458 --> 01:45:28.042
- Hello?
- Call!

01:45:28.542 --> 01:45:30.374
Victoria, what happened?
Are you OK? Is everyone OK?

01:45:30.375 --> 01:45:33.541
They treated us well.
Don't worry.

01:45:33.542 --> 01:45:35.374
You have to be careful, okay?

01:45:35.375 --> 01:45:38.291
How are they? How are they? How are you?
How is Manuela?

01:45:38.292 --> 01:45:42.041
Where's Manuela?
She's OK, she's ok.

01:45:42.042 --> 01:45:46.374
We're always thinking about you, Pablo.
We miss you so much.

01:45:46.375 --> 01:45:50.124
Can you come and go? Are they protecting
you? Are they holding you hostage?

01:45:50.125 --> 01:45:51.666
There's an army outside.

01:45:51.667 --> 01:45:53.874
Puppy Dog, do you read?

01:45:53.875 --> 01:45:58.749
The man is on the phone. La América sector.
I repeat La America sector.

01:45:58.750 --> 01:46:00.708
We're on our way, sir.

01:46:02.375 --> 01:46:05.749
Ask the attorney general to release you.
Yes, attorney general.

01:46:05.750 --> 01:46:10.375
It's only I can take care of my
family, nobody else, nobody else, okay?

01:46:13.083 --> 01:46:14.708
Hello?

01:46:15.833 --> 01:46:17.333
Hello?

01:46:20.625 --> 01:46:22.833
Anybody listening?

01:46:23.542 --> 01:46:25.167
Hello?

01:46:26.333 --> 01:46:27.750
Hello?

01:46:28.792 --> 01:46:30.583
Two minutes, boss.

01:46:31.042 --> 01:46:35.541
I know you are all there listening.

01:46:35.542 --> 01:46:38.749
See, how you look like a
bunch of fucking pussies

01:46:38.750 --> 01:46:43.416
the colonel and his black trash and
all of you gringos who went puta with my

01:46:43.417 --> 01:46:46.582
and the CIA and that
motherfucker with the DEA.

01:46:46.583 --> 01:46:50.291
Are you ready to spare your life once,
I won't spare you the game.

01:46:50.292 --> 01:46:52.791
Now listen to me, my padrinos, everyone.

01:46:52.792 --> 01:46:56.541
I'm going to kill you and your
children and your wives

01:46:56.542 --> 01:47:00.416
and I'm saving a special bullet to
put right in front your fucking skull

01:47:00.417 --> 01:47:03.499
and you want to bleed until you die!

01:47:03.500 --> 01:47:08.333
Do you hear me, you damn bastards?
Motherfuckers.

01:47:10.375 --> 01:47:14.374
Don't call here anymore.
The police will come...

01:47:14.375 --> 01:47:17.000
Victoria, don't tell me what to do.
Do what I ask you.

01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:20.542
See, see, keep Manuela nearby.

01:47:21.583 --> 01:47:22.792
Motherfuckers!

01:47:42.167 --> 01:47:44.500
Motherfuckers.

01:47:45.625 --> 01:47:48.250
- Stay calm, boss.
- Check it, check it.

01:47:55.250 --> 01:47:56.417
Hold on.

01:48:04.792 --> 01:48:10.125
The previous moment to something happening
is always the best moment.

01:48:11.625 --> 01:48:14.833
Like when you are waiting
for the man you love,

01:48:14.875 --> 01:48:17.583
or when you are about
to open a present.

01:48:21.667 --> 01:48:28.208
The fisherman from the coast of Colombia
say that would really matters is the wait.

01:48:29.375 --> 01:48:32.166
Feeling the sea
breeze on your face.

01:48:32.167 --> 01:48:35.000
The salt on your lips.

01:48:36.042 --> 01:48:40.958
Imagining that little fish fucker
approaching the bait.

01:48:42.625 --> 01:48:46.542
He wants to bite it but he
thinks it over

01:48:52.833 --> 01:48:55.374
But if the bait is good enough

01:48:55.375 --> 01:48:58.833
The fish will eventually bite it.

01:49:03.250 --> 01:49:06.583
Even when he knows
there is a hook inside.

01:49:12.625 --> 01:49:14.458
He'll bite.

01:49:33.708 --> 01:49:35.167
Call!

01:49:36.208 --> 01:49:38.250
Daddy?

01:49:38.917 --> 01:49:41.125
Hi Manuela...

01:49:41.833 --> 01:49:44.999
How is the most beautiful star in the sky?

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.832
Mommy says I can't
be in the show.

01:49:47.833 --> 01:49:52.416
Mommy is wrong. Mommy is saying it
badly she wants it to be a surprise.

01:49:52.417 --> 01:49:54.958
Until her I told yes.

01:49:55.542 --> 01:50:00.874
I'm getting a signal. Somewhere in
Los Olivos, between 80 and 90.

01:50:00.875 --> 01:50:03.291
Los Olivos, 80th and 90th.

01:50:03.292 --> 01:50:05.625
To Los Olivos! To Los Olivos!

01:50:09.917 --> 01:50:13.875
- You have your dress ready?
- It's so shiny, daddy.

01:50:15.542 --> 01:50:17.125
Beautiful.

01:50:17.833 --> 01:50:19.750
Beautiful.

01:50:21.875 --> 01:50:28.041
Everything is going to be much, much better
from now on. You will see.

01:50:28.042 --> 01:50:30.542
Mi amor you will see.

01:50:31.958 --> 01:50:34.500
Correction: 70 and 80.

01:50:37.292 --> 01:50:39.583
Will you come and see me?

01:50:43.333 --> 01:50:45.207
Yes I will. Of course.

01:50:45.208 --> 01:50:47.125
Will they let you?

01:50:49.958 --> 01:50:53.500
They? They will, of course they will.

01:50:55.708 --> 01:50:58.417
- And you know why?
- Because you're the king?

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.833
Yes, I am the king.

01:51:07.958 --> 01:51:10.832
72 and 80th. 74 and 80th.

01:51:10.833 --> 01:51:13.167
- 74 and 80th.
- To the left!

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.667
50 meters! Turn here!

01:51:21.583 --> 01:51:24.042
Sweetheart, give the phone to Juan Pablo.

01:51:28.292 --> 01:51:30.124
- I just saw him!
- We got him!

01:51:30.125 --> 01:51:32.124
Inform the president!

01:51:32.125 --> 01:51:33.917
Dad?

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:38.541
- Boss, two minutes.
- Now Pablito, you are now the man of the house.

01:51:38.542 --> 01:51:43.041
Now you have to take care of your mother
and Manuela, do you understand me?

01:51:43.042 --> 01:51:45.374
- Do you understand me?
- Okay.

01:51:45.375 --> 01:51:47.667
Ok I have some notes for
you to tell the press.

01:51:47.708 --> 01:51:49.582
Go ahead. Write it
down, write it down.

01:51:49.583 --> 01:51:54.166
OK, the attorney general agreed on getting
you out of the country but they didn't do it

01:51:54.167 --> 01:51:58.125
Because they gave in to the pressure of my
enemies in Colombia and out of Colombia

01:52:05.667 --> 01:52:09.707
Tell them that Pablo Escobar agreed on turning
himself in the moment his family was safe,

01:52:09.708 --> 01:52:11.832
but they did not keep their
side of the deal and now

01:52:11.833 --> 01:52:13.707
- they will have to pay the consequences.
- Move in!

01:52:13.708 --> 01:52:16.042
Whatever happens from now
on is gonna be their fault.

01:52:16.083 --> 01:52:18.167
Okay? Repeat what I said
back to me Juan Pablo.

01:52:35.958 --> 01:52:38.249
No no no no!

01:52:38.250 --> 01:52:40.249
No, that's not what I said, Juan Pablo.
That's not what I said.

01:52:40.250 --> 01:52:44.124
I said that they are responsible for all of this
and that they have to face the consequences now.

01:52:44.125 --> 01:52:47.833
- Do you understand me?
- Okay, Dad. I'm going to hang up.

01:53:05.792 --> 01:53:08.624
Say it! Listen, you have to learn this.

01:53:08.625 --> 01:53:12.041
If you, If you can't get people to like you,
then you have to make them to respect you!

01:53:12.042 --> 01:53:15.082
And if they don't respect you,
then make them fear you!

01:53:15.083 --> 01:53:17.375
Understood? Understood?

01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:20.416
Make them fear you!

01:53:20.417 --> 01:53:22.542
Do you hear that?

01:53:26.292 --> 01:53:28.000
Hold on.

01:53:28.833 --> 01:53:30.542
Dad?

01:55:03.292 --> 01:55:06.083
Long live Colombia!

01:55:07.750 --> 01:55:10.207
Long live Colombia!

01:55:10.208 --> 01:55:12.542
Long live Colombia!

01:55:20.542 --> 01:55:24.083
Long live Colombia!
Long live Colombia!

01:55:37.917 --> 01:55:41.666
A last minute wire confirms
that Pablo Escobar Gaviria

01:55:41.667 --> 01:55:44.041
the ex-boss of the Medellin Cartel

01:55:44.042 --> 01:55:47.582
has been gunned down today by
members of the search block

01:55:47.583 --> 01:55:50.249
in a residential neighborhood of Medellin.

01:55:50.250 --> 01:55:56.625
Along with Escobar police also killed
Carlos Mejía Rosales, who alias Pelao.

01:55:59.375 --> 01:56:01.208
Virginia.

01:56:02.875 --> 01:56:04.792
Are you ready?

01:56:09.167 --> 01:56:11.333
I'll wait for you outside.

01:56:41.083 --> 01:56:43.542
Do you still love him?

01:56:46.875 --> 01:56:49.042
I love Pablo.

01:56:49.708 --> 01:56:51.916
I hate Escobar.

01:56:51.917 --> 01:56:54.625
Would you be willing to testify
before a federal judge?

01:56:57.167 --> 01:56:59.708
He asked me to tell his story.

01:57:00.917 --> 01:57:03.292
He just didn't say who to tell.

01:57:04.305 --> 01:57:10.462
