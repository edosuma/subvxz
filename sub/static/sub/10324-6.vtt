00:04.804 --> 00:08.262
<i>[Earl Narrating] It used to be the best part</i>
<i>about finishing a meal at the Crab Shack...</i>

00:08.375 --> 00:10.775
<i>was that you were finished</i>
<i>with a meal at the Crab Shack.</i>

00:10.877 --> 00:13.209
<i>But Darnell was makin'</i>
<i>a few changes.</i>

00:13.313 --> 00:16.043
Can I tempt you fellas
with some desserts?

00:16.149 --> 00:18.049
Wow, strawberry shortcake.
Fancy.

00:18.151 --> 00:20.051
We're tryin' to class the place up...

00:20.153 --> 00:22.383
and this was easier than
tryin' to get rid of that smell.

00:22.489 --> 00:24.684
That strawberry shortcake
sure does look good, huh, Earl?

00:24.791 --> 00:27.760
I don't like strawberries.
But I'm gonna take that German chocolate.

00:27.861 --> 00:30.193
- <i>[Bell Dings]</i>
- I don't like strawberries too.

00:30.296 --> 00:33.026
I didn't realize
that's what was in it.

00:33.133 --> 00:37.001
Chocolate sounds better.
And German's one of my favorite flavors.

00:38.304 --> 00:40.295
You boys finish up your homework.

00:40.407 --> 00:42.307
Don't do too good a job at it.

00:42.409 --> 00:44.468
Mama needs that summer school
for free day care.

00:44.577 --> 00:46.807
I gotta draw something I think
is beautiful for art class...

00:46.913 --> 00:48.813
and I can't think of anything.

00:48.915 --> 00:50.940
Well, what about a butterfly
or a rainbow...

00:51.051 --> 00:53.246
or the small of
Denzel Washington's back?

00:53.353 --> 00:55.048
I drew something beautiful, Mom.

00:55.155 --> 00:57.988
- Who is that?
- Her.

01:01.528 --> 01:04.793
Please tell me somebody

01:04.897 --> 01:06.957

A dude cheerleader!
[Groans]

01:14.674 --> 01:17.575
<i>They should put a skirt on him,</i>
<i>like the rest of the girls.</i>

01:17.677 --> 01:20.612
And stuff his bra.
And put lipstick on him.

01:20.713 --> 01:24.649
<i>[Earl Narrating] This wasn't the first mob</i>
<i>I had ever seen turn on a male cheerleader.</i>

01:24.751 --> 01:27.345
<i>And it reminded me</i>

01:27.454 --> 01:28.682
- <i>[School Bell Rings]</i>
- Hey, Kenny.

01:28.788 --> 01:31.188
- [Gasps]
- <i>Whoa. Where you goin'?</i>

01:31.291 --> 01:33.987
- Didn't you hear? I'm the new backpack inspector.
- [Zipper Opens]

01:34.094 --> 01:37.860
George Orwell,
you sure were right about 1984.

01:37.964 --> 01:39.864
[Chuckles]
What's this?

01:39.966 --> 01:43.493
Oh, my God.
Kenny wants to be a cheerleader!

01:43.603 --> 01:47.130
N-N-No, I don't!
I was gonna audition for the football-

01:47.240 --> 01:50.107
<i>A sock, man. Nice, Randy.</i>

01:50.210 --> 01:53.543
But you already crossed Kenny off.
Remember? You made him gay.

01:53.646 --> 01:56.206
Well, I crossed "Always picked
on KennyJames" off my list...

01:56.316 --> 01:59.717
but "Kept Kenny from his dream of cheerleading"
is an entirely different list item.

01:59.819 --> 02:02.447
Well, then "Made Randy
drink toilet water when he was eight"...

02:02.555 --> 02:06.321
and "Made Randy drink toilet water when
he was 10" better be two separate list items.

02:09.062 --> 02:12.225
[Gasps]
<i>Dios mï¿½o.</i> What's wrong with you?

02:12.332 --> 02:14.630
Keep talkin',
I'm gonna cut off that hair!

02:14.734 --> 02:17.168
[Voice Cracks]
That beautiful, beautiful hair.

[Woman On TV]
At Kimmi Himler Cheer Academy...

02:19.272 --> 02:21.263

02:21.374 --> 02:23.808

with the best of them!

02:23.910 --> 02:26.902
Each camp session includes
an end of session cheer-off!

02:27.013 --> 02:28.981
Come for the cheer.
Stay for the friendships.

02:29.082 --> 02:30.982
[Man On TV]
Friendships not guaranteed by camp.

02:31.084 --> 02:33.143
We've got spirit!
Yes, we do!

02:33.253 --> 02:36.120
We've got spirit!
How about you?

02:36.222 --> 02:39.191
[Woman On TV]
How about you? You? You?

02:39.292 --> 02:41.192
So I checked with the camp...

02:41.294 --> 02:44.263
and they said they're okay with a grown man
staying in dorms with teen girls.

02:44.364 --> 02:47.094
You just have to sign
a "no statutory rape" waiver.

02:47.200 --> 02:50.328
I told 'em you were gay, but they said
they're not fallin' for that again.

02:50.436 --> 02:53.894
Oh, well, that's so nice of you.
But that cheerleading flyer wasn't mine.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.498
I've been trying to tell you.
That was ac-

02:56.609 --> 02:59.976
<i>[Earl Narrating] There was a reason</i>
<i>Randy kept stickin'socks in Kenny's mouth.</i>

03:00.079 --> 03:03.412
<i>Kenny didn't want to be</i>
<i>a cheerleader. Randy did.</i>

03:03.516 --> 03:05.711
- <i>Turns out, I only knew half the story.</i>
- <i>[School Bell Rings]</i>

03:05.818 --> 03:07.718

03:07.820 --> 03:10.755
For a gay guy, you sure
do have a good memory.

03:10.857 --> 03:13.690
Randy, l-I didn't know
you wanted to be a cheerleader.

03:13.793 --> 03:15.693
Come back so we can talk about this!

03:15.795 --> 03:18.730

<i>[Lock Clicks]</i>

03:25.805 --> 03:29.366

03:29.475 --> 03:32.638
<i>[Earl Narrating] Randy wantin'to be</i>
<i>a dude cheerleader seemed kinda crazy.</i>

- Cockroach.

03:37.850 --> 03:40.080
[Sighs]

03:42.288 --> 03:44.688
I'll have the number two special.

03:44.791 --> 03:48.227
- What would you like to order, Randy?
- Number one!

03:52.098 --> 03:55.966
- Well, that's the last beer.
- I'll go get another case.

03:56.069 --> 03:59.402
<i>## [Girls Vocalizing]</i>

04:02.709 --> 04:06.406
- Randy? Come on. Randy?
- How long do you think you're gonna be in here?

04:06.512 --> 04:09.777
These bubbles are going fast, and Kenny
doesn't like anyone else to see Chester.

04:09.882 --> 04:11.907
Stuart,
put a washcloth over Chester!

04:12.018 --> 04:13.576
<i>[Earl]</i>
<i>Randy, you're on my list now.</i>

04:13.686 --> 04:16.779
<i>And l-I can't cross you off</i>
<i>until I send you to cheerleadin'camp.</i>

04:16.889 --> 04:19.255
So you can make fun of me?

04:19.358 --> 04:22.089
- Tell him you want to go too.
- No! I'm a man.

04:22.195 --> 04:25.062
It's the only way Randy will do it.
He follows whatever you do.

04:25.164 --> 04:27.997
How many years were you
Batman and Big Batman for Halloween?

04:28.101 --> 04:31.366
<i>[Earl Narrating] Kenny was right.</i>
<i>Randy does do everything I do.</i>

04:31.471 --> 04:33.530
<i>And if I was gonna cross him</i>
<i>off my list...</i>

04:33.640 --> 04:36.165
<i>we were gonna have to be</i>
<i>cheerleader and big cheerleader.</i>

04:36.276 --> 04:38.767
I made fun of dude cheerleaders
'cause-

04:38.878 --> 04:41.210
<i>[Exhales]</i>
<i>I kinda wanted to be one too.</i>

04:41.314 --> 04:43.976
L-I just didn't think I could make it.

- You're just sayin' that.
- I love cheerin'.

04:47.320 --> 04:50.153
My whole life,

- Pom-poms.
- Y-Two poms.

04:52.425 --> 04:56.156
<i>In fact, l-l-I've been sneakin'off</i>
<i>to cheer for years.</i>

04:56.262 --> 04:59.959
But mostly in the shower, so I've never
tried anything too advanced...

05:00.066 --> 05:02.830
'cause of how slippery
it is in there.

05:02.935 --> 05:05.460
Yeah. That's why I wear
my shoes when I shower.

05:05.571 --> 05:07.471
Do you still want to
be a cheerleader?

05:10.476 --> 05:14.003
Yep. That's why I'm gonna
go to this camp with or without you.

05:14.113 --> 05:17.514
<i>Randy, I don't know much</i>
<i>about cheerleading camp...</i>

05:17.617 --> 05:20.347
but it sounds
[Singsong] spectacular!

05:20.453 --> 05:22.353
Kenny taught me to say it that way.

05:25.525 --> 05:29.188
[Cheering, Indistinct]

05:30.496 --> 05:33.465
- Ready?
- Okay.

05:38.371 --> 05:41.772
<i>[Earl Narrating] When we were kids, I'd destroyed</i>
<i>Randy's dream ofbecoming a cheerleader...</i>

<i>which probably kept Dad</i>

05:44.711 --> 05:47.202
<i>But I still needed</i>
<i>to make it up to him.</i>

Oh, apparently we have

- [Screaming Continues]

- Come on, Earl. Get on.

<i>Don't even bother.</i>
<i>Last place gets last dorm pick.</i>

08:17.830 --> 08:21.664
As usual, looks like last place
is going to go to Camden!

08:22.668 --> 08:24.568
Perfect as usual, Nathanville.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.570
Thanks, Mom.

08:26.672 --> 08:31.666
Maybe they'll give us a nice dorm
because of your... situation.

08:31.777 --> 08:35.076
No, we got the crappy ones last year,
and I was pregnant then too.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.513
<i>[Earl Narrating] Cheer camp was</i>
<i>gonna be harder than I thought...</i>

08:38.818 --> 08:41.013
<i>and so was changing Dodge's mind.</i>

08:41.120 --> 08:43.179
Blonde hair and blue eyes is rare...

08:43.289 --> 08:45.621
so it's considered
a treasure of the human race.

08:45.725 --> 08:47.625
It's what World War II was about.

08:47.727 --> 08:50.958
Why do you think theJapanese
bombed Pearl Harbor? Jealous.

08:56.736 --> 09:01.139
Oh, come on! You just like her
'cause she's the same color as pancakes.

09:03.743 --> 09:05.643
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>Even though me and Randy...</i>

09:05.745 --> 09:07.770
<i>would be sleeping</i>
<i>in the third floorjanitor's closet...</i>

09:07.880 --> 09:10.849
<i>they did let us help our teammates</i>
<i>get moved into their rooms.</i>

09:10.950 --> 09:13.145
It's not that bad.

09:13.252 --> 09:16.744
If it makes you feel better, I don't think
that urine smell's from humans.

09:16.856 --> 09:19.381
[Scoffs] These are the bunks
that Camden gets every year...

09:19.492 --> 09:22.484
because we always
come last at everything.

09:22.595 --> 09:24.563
Randy, you know,
if we're gonna lose anyway...

09:24.664 --> 09:28.156
maybe we should just pack up our tiny,
tight, itchy cheer pants and go.

09:28.267 --> 09:31.395
We can't quit, Earl.
We've got more competitions.

09:31.504 --> 09:34.564
<i>And at the end of the week,</i>
<i>we cheer in front of a real crowd.</i>

09:34.674 --> 09:38.235
They'll yell back any letter you ask 'em to.
Even the hard letters.

09:38.344 --> 09:40.972
What's the point of bein' in front
of a crowd when we're gonna suck?

09:41.080 --> 09:44.572
<i>Speak for yourself, robo face.</i>
<i>I don't suck.</i>

09:44.684 --> 09:47.482
- [Chuckles]
- Cool it, Juno. You suck worser than she do.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.317
Every time you do a split, I'm afraid
your little mistake's gonna pop out.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.323
This pregnancy was not a mistake.

09:52.425 --> 09:55.087
At the time, Coach Barnes and I
were in a committed relationship.

09:55.194 --> 09:58.823
- That's not what I heard.
- Oh, eat a chicken, fat ass.

09:58.931 --> 10:02.230
Stop it! Stop callin'
each other names!

10:02.335 --> 10:05.133
Come on. Preggers, Headgear,
Chunk, Black Girl.

10:05.237 --> 10:07.603
You know why Badger Face
treats us so bad?

10:07.707 --> 10:12.167
Because people expect Camden folks
to act this way, to turn on each other.

10:12.278 --> 10:16.544
Me and Earl have been dreamin'
about bein' cheerleaders our whole lives...

10:16.649 --> 10:21.245
<i>but we never did anything about it because</i>
<i>we let what other people thought control us.</i>

10:21.354 --> 10:23.914
- Right, Earl?
- Yep.

10:24.023 --> 10:26.014
And now I'm gonna
be a cheerleader...

10:26.125 --> 10:29.617
no matter how stupid and girlie
and embarrassin' that is.

10:29.729 --> 10:32.698
<i>Who cares what other people think?</i>

10:32.798 --> 10:37.201
I'm here to do whatever it takes
to be the most best cheerleader I can be.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.931
Me too. Maybe this year
the football team...

10:40.039 --> 10:42.735
will finally invite me to a party
that's actually happening.

10:42.842 --> 10:44.742
That's the spirit, Headgear.

10:44.844 --> 10:47.108
Look at all the good things
about our squad.

10:47.213 --> 10:51.309
Like Preggers is actually
two cheerleaders in one.

10:51.417 --> 10:53.317

Sorry. I have bad news.
I went through the rule book...

participate in the camp.

12:04.590 --> 12:06.581
So P-A-C-K up your crap and go!

12:10.596 --> 12:13.997
I guess I won't get to cheer
in front of a real crowd after all.

12:14.100 --> 12:16.898
But Kimmi owns the camp.
She can change the rules.

12:17.002 --> 12:20.733
Doesn't matter, Earl. The president owns
the country, but he doesn't make the rules.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.740
The Pilgrims make the rules.

14:04.577 --> 14:08.877
- Can you hand me my fishnets?
- Good God, this Catalina thing is making you crazy.

14:08.981 --> 14:12.212
What is so crazy about a mama
wantin' her son to think she's sexy?

14:12.318 --> 14:14.718
Everything! Boys aren't supposed to
think their mothers are sexy.

14:14.820 --> 14:16.720
I mean, maybe
a couple weird dreams during puberty...

14:16.822 --> 14:18.722

14:18.824 --> 14:22.055
I'm not just gonna sit back and
lose my son to some skeevy senorita.

14:22.161 --> 14:24.061
He's not gonna run off with Catalina.

14:24.163 --> 14:27.690
Even if she was into eight-year-olds,
I doubt she wants you as a mother-in-law.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.700
Catalina's just
