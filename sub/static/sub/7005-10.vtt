00:01.800 --> 00:04.067
If you're like me
and you have a problem
with space,

00:04.069 --> 00:06.137
Well, you can't
do better than

00:06.138 --> 00:08.540
The binford 6100
telescopic ladder.

00:08.541 --> 00:12.444
If you're like al,
you'll need more than a ladder
to solve your problems.

00:12.445 --> 00:14.679
The beauty of this ladder
is that, closed,

00:14.680 --> 00:16.581
It's only
2 1/2 feet tall.

00:16.582 --> 00:19.951
With a simple tug,
it expands to 12 1/2 feet.

00:19.952 --> 00:23.655
You just pull... Oh, this is
jammed or something, al.

00:28.928 --> 00:30.962
I'll just climb up there

00:30.963 --> 00:32.964
And show ya
how sturdy this is.

00:32.965 --> 00:35.934
The binford telescopic ladder,
just as supportive -

00:35.935 --> 00:38.437
Tim, you might wanna
watch the, uh...
Could I finish, al?

00:38.438 --> 00:42.173
I just want ya to be careful
so you don't -
aah!

00:49.414 --> 00:53.351
The binford 6100
telescopic ladder.

00:53.352 --> 00:57.188
Perfectly safe for those of you
who take the time to read
the safety instructions.

00:57.189 --> 00:59.791
<i>(end of segment music plays)</i>

00:59.792 --> 01:01.893
<i>(applause and cheering)</i>

01:05.931 --> 01:09.968
All right. Now is the time
we go to our mailbag.

01:09.969 --> 01:12.637
That's right. Viewers
write in their questions,
and I answer them.

01:12.638 --> 01:16.007
And I give
the correct
information.

01:16.008 --> 01:18.877
You're just a superhighway
of information, al.

01:18.878 --> 01:21.012
If you wanna contact al
via the computer,

01:21.013 --> 01:23.481
He's on e-mail
in the flannel net.

01:23.482 --> 01:26.617
Heidi, my mailbag,
please.

01:28.354 --> 01:30.388
Here you are, tim.

01:30.389 --> 01:33.358
Thank you.

01:33.359 --> 01:35.727
"dear tim and al,

01:35.728 --> 01:39.296
"my wife says
I spend too much money
at the hardware store.

01:39.297 --> 01:43.034
"what percentage of our budget
should I spend on tools?

01:43.035 --> 01:45.437
Signed,
confused in lansing."

01:45.438 --> 01:48.873
Take your entire budget,
subtract your house payment,
if there is one,

01:48.874 --> 01:51.876
Utilities, phone,
add up that total,

01:51.877 --> 01:54.645
And forget about it
and buy whatever you want, huh?

01:54.646 --> 01:56.615
Ha-ha-ha.

01:56.616 --> 01:58.983
Remembering to leave
a little aside

01:58.984 --> 02:01.186
For your future
divorce lawyer.

02:01.187 --> 02:05.122
Whoa, this letter's from
western michigan university.

02:05.123 --> 02:07.826
That's where my wife and I
went to college.

02:07.827 --> 02:11.262
They must've seen our show,
and they want their diploma
back.

02:11.263 --> 02:13.397
<i>(both snicker)</i>

02:15.668 --> 02:18.370
Couldn't be further
from the truth.
Listen to this.

02:18.371 --> 02:21.106
"dear tim, in recognition
for the fine work you do,

02:21.107 --> 02:25.510
We would like to bestow upon you
an honorary ph.D."

02:25.511 --> 02:28.079
Arr-arr-arr.

02:28.080 --> 02:29.380
Arr-arr-arr.

02:32.251 --> 02:34.085
Oh, now wait a second.

02:34.086 --> 02:36.320
Your alma mater wants to
give you a doctorate?

02:36.321 --> 02:39.290
That's right. Yeah.

02:39.291 --> 02:42.794
From now on, you'll be
standing next to a doctor.

02:42.795 --> 02:45.563
Which would make you
my nurse.

03:40.385 --> 03:42.386
Oh, no.

03:42.387 --> 03:45.322
Mom's giving away our toys
to charity again.

03:45.323 --> 03:49.060
I hate when she does that.

03:49.061 --> 03:52.030
We told her to keep the toys
and give you away,

03:52.031 --> 03:55.867
But no charity would take ya.

03:55.868 --> 03:58.769
When are you gonna grow up
and stop playing with
stupid toys?

03:58.770 --> 04:01.339
Hey, not all of this stuff
is mine.

04:01.340 --> 04:03.675
I believe this is
your whoopee cushion.

04:03.676 --> 04:06.411
Hey, not the gas master.

04:06.412 --> 04:09.447
This is
a family heirloom.

04:09.448 --> 04:11.749
Taylor men have been
sliding it under
unsuspecting butts

04:11.750 --> 04:14.785
For generations.

04:14.786 --> 04:18.889
Wait. Mom cannot
give away my dart gun.

04:23.963 --> 04:28.332
Glad I talked mom
out of buying you a bb gun.

04:28.333 --> 04:30.769
What's the box?
What's going on?

04:30.770 --> 04:33.605
Mom's giving away our toys
to charity again.

04:33.606 --> 04:36.941
She can't give away
our toys.

04:36.942 --> 04:39.377
Especially not
my spring-loaded eyeballs.

04:39.378 --> 04:41.146
I love these things.

04:42.948 --> 04:45.617
Guys, you won't believe
what happened today.

04:45.618 --> 04:49.387
I got a ph.D. From
western michigan university.

04:53.058 --> 04:55.226
You?

04:57.163 --> 05:00.898
You sure it's not
a ph.D-minus?

05:03.602 --> 05:08.406
No, wise guy.
It's an honorary ph.D. From
the engineering department.

05:08.407 --> 05:10.642
Whoa-oa-oa.

05:12.244 --> 05:15.079
You got a degree
when you didn't even
earn it?

05:15.080 --> 05:18.315
Can I get
that type of deal
for high school?

05:18.316 --> 05:21.719
I hope so.
It's your only shot
at graduating.

05:38.404 --> 05:42.841
This is why we're
getting rid of those toys.

05:42.842 --> 05:45.710
So how was your day?
Horrible.

05:45.711 --> 05:48.580
My behavioral psych professor
has assigned yet another paper.

05:48.581 --> 05:50.582
I haven't finished
the first one.

05:50.583 --> 05:53.918
Plus, I have to get through
these books by this weekend.

05:53.919 --> 05:55.553
What did you do today?

05:55.554 --> 05:57.755
Got a ph.D.

05:57.756 --> 05:59.257
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

06:02.761 --> 06:04.595
Very funny.

06:04.596 --> 06:06.030
Funny, huh?

06:06.031 --> 06:08.867
Check out the letter
from western michigan.

06:14.039 --> 06:17.709
You barely graduated,
and they're giving you
an honorary degree?

06:17.710 --> 06:20.611
Makes me wonder
why I worked so hard
for the first one.

06:22.514 --> 06:24.515
You didn't work
at all.

06:24.516 --> 06:26.751
You partied
the whole time.

06:26.752 --> 06:29.520
And the celebration
continues.

06:32.023 --> 06:35.025
<i>(pounding)</i>

06:39.698 --> 06:42.133
Tim, I'm trying
to study here.

06:42.134 --> 06:45.770
I understand.
You're working hard to get
your advanced degree, too.

06:51.143 --> 06:53.177
What are you doing?

06:53.178 --> 06:56.547
I'm hanging up that letter
that says I'm gonna get a ph.D.

07:00.018 --> 07:02.887
You framed the letter?

07:02.888 --> 07:06.157
Yeah. I framed the envelope
it came in, too.

07:07.226 --> 07:09.894
<i>(phone rings)</i>

07:11.863 --> 07:14.198
Hello.

07:14.199 --> 07:17.000
Yes, this is dr. Taylor.

07:20.238 --> 07:22.940
Harry, real funny.
Ha-ha-ha. Yeah.

07:22.941 --> 07:26.845
He's calling me
tim "the school man" taylor.

07:26.846 --> 07:29.147
Harry is droll.

07:29.148 --> 07:32.383
Huh? What?
She called you a troll.

07:32.384 --> 07:35.453
All right, I'll stop by
the hardware store.

07:35.454 --> 07:38.556
Thanks. Bye. That was nice
of him to call, wasn't it?

07:38.557 --> 07:41.292
Yeah, it's really sweet.
I've got to study.

07:41.293 --> 07:43.294
All right,
no more interruptions.

07:43.295 --> 07:46.297
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

07:48.833 --> 07:51.535
I have a delivery
for a dr. Taylor.

07:53.772 --> 07:58.576
Hey, doc,
how do I get rid of
this big wart on my hand?

07:58.577 --> 08:01.846
Ball-peen hammer, chisel.
It'll pop right off.

08:03.616 --> 08:05.250
Thanks, doc.

08:10.589 --> 08:12.857
Jill, you didn't
have to do this.

08:12.858 --> 08:15.493
I didn't. Gosh, somebody
really went overboard.

08:15.494 --> 08:17.629
Who would send
such a huge arrangement?

08:17.630 --> 08:19.196
Your mom and dad.

08:21.199 --> 08:23.001
What?

08:23.002 --> 08:24.669
They said, "dear son..."

08:24.670 --> 08:27.304
They called me "son" instead
of "hey, you." I like that.

08:27.305 --> 08:30.008
"saw the show. It's great
to have ph.D. In the family.

08:30.009 --> 08:32.010
We're very proud of you.
Love, lillian and the colonel."

08:32.010 --> 08:34.278
I can't believe
they did this.

08:34.279 --> 08:36.847
I can't believe it,
either.

08:36.849 --> 08:38.881
They barely acknowledge me
going back to school.

08:38.883 --> 08:40.884
Now they're
sending you flowers?

08:40.885 --> 08:43.788
Come on, jill. They're proud
of my accomplishments.

08:43.789 --> 08:46.424
Accomplishments?

08:46.425 --> 08:48.526
Well, yeah.

08:48.527 --> 08:53.431
I teach people
from all walks of life

08:53.432 --> 08:55.499
The complexities
of tool usage

08:55.500 --> 08:58.202
In an ever-changing world.

09:00.105 --> 09:02.806
I believe I've actually
bridged the gap

09:02.807 --> 09:06.944
Between the world of hardware
and academia.

09:06.945 --> 09:10.781
Now you just need to
bridge the gap between
fantasy and reality.

09:16.655 --> 09:18.188
Hey, wilson.

09:18.189 --> 09:22.126
Well, hi-ho,
fairest of the taylors.

09:22.127 --> 09:24.329
Jill, what time
do you have?

09:24.330 --> 09:26.431
Uh, 8:33.

09:26.432 --> 09:28.298
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

09:28.299 --> 09:31.235
My new sundial
seems to be running
a bit slow.

09:31.236 --> 09:36.040
Maybe you should noodle
with your gnomon.

09:36.041 --> 09:39.277
I beg your pardon.

09:39.278 --> 09:42.981
The gnomon -
it's that crossbar there.
It should be pointing north.

09:42.982 --> 09:45.783
Oh, ho-ho, well,
thank you, jill.

09:45.784 --> 09:49.220
It's such a pleasure having
a knowledgeable neighborette.

09:49.221 --> 09:51.222
Huh! I may be knowledgeable,

09:51.223 --> 09:53.458
But tim's the one
getting the ph.D.

09:53.459 --> 09:56.660
<i>(chuckles)</i>

09:56.661 --> 10:00.098
Knowledgeable
and funny, funny, funny.

10:01.634 --> 10:04.836
I'm not kiddin'.
Didn't tim tell you?
No.

10:04.837 --> 10:07.638
Western michigan
is giving tim

10:07.639 --> 10:10.842
An honorary doctorate.

10:10.843 --> 10:11.976
Tim?

10:14.046 --> 10:17.315
Yeah. Here I am killing myself
to get an advanced degree.

10:17.316 --> 10:20.351
They just hand him one.
I'm trying not to be -
I just can't -

10:20.352 --> 10:22.286
Well, well, well, well,
jill, jill, jill.

10:22.287 --> 10:25.255
I've never been a proponent
of symbolic gestures,

10:25.256 --> 10:29.160
But tim is your husband,
he is my neighbor.

10:29.161 --> 10:31.162
We should be happy.

10:31.163 --> 10:34.031
<i>(sighs)</i> you're right.

10:34.032 --> 10:36.467
A ph.D.?

10:38.437 --> 10:39.804
Tim?

10:39.805 --> 10:45.443
Aw, jill, jill,
jill, jill...

10:45.444 --> 10:47.945
Do you realize
how many hours
I had to study

10:47.946 --> 10:51.315
To get my doctorate
in forgotten languages
and extinct cultures?

10:51.316 --> 10:53.283
Oh, my, my, my.

10:53.284 --> 10:55.285
Sitting in that library,

10:55.286 --> 10:57.287
Reading that
insufferable microfilm

10:57.288 --> 10:59.690
Till I thought I would
practically go blind?

10:59.691 --> 11:01.726
Not to mention
that to support myself,

11:01.727 --> 11:06.297
I had to volunteer as a subject
for lab experiments. Oh, oh.

11:06.298 --> 11:10.134
And the thing
that really irritates me
about this whole thing -

11:10.135 --> 11:12.270
Jill, jill, talk me down,
talk me down.

11:16.608 --> 11:19.743
I came out here
so you'd talk me down.

11:19.744 --> 11:21.779
Oh, I'm sorry, jill.
I lost control.

11:21.780 --> 11:24.014
I know.
It's ok, it's ok.

11:24.015 --> 11:27.618
What can I say here that might
put this into perspective
for both of us?

11:27.619 --> 11:30.821
Oh, yes. The late senator
dwight morrow said

11:30.822 --> 11:34.458
There are people who do things
and people who take the credit,

11:34.459 --> 11:36.460
And the trick is to be
in the first group.

11:36.461 --> 11:39.630
There's a lot less
competition.

11:39.631 --> 11:42.133
I see what you're sayin'.
Does that make you
feel any better?

11:42.134 --> 11:44.969
Not at all.
Me, neither.

11:44.970 --> 11:47.872
On the other hand, it is
a great honor for tim,

11:47.873 --> 11:50.174
And I guess we have to put
our negative feelings aside

11:50.175 --> 11:52.777
And just find a way
to cheer him on.

11:52.778 --> 11:55.646
Well, I know. He should
be allowed to enjoy this.

11:55.647 --> 11:57.648
I should be more supportive.

11:57.649 --> 12:00.417
Mm-hmm. And if the university
is giving him a ph.D.,

12:00.418 --> 12:02.954
They must feel
he is a worthy recipient.

12:02.955 --> 12:06.323
<i>(thumping)</i>

12:18.070 --> 12:21.806
Obviously they know something
we don't.

12:27.512 --> 12:30.114
Does everybody know
what time it is?

12:30.115 --> 12:31.849
<i>(all) tool time.</i>

12:31.850 --> 12:33.851
That's right. Binford tools
is proud to present

12:33.852 --> 12:35.219
The star of our show -

12:35.220 --> 12:38.723
Dr. Tim
"the tool man" taylor."

12:44.095 --> 12:46.430
Thank you, and welcome
to <i>tool time.</i>

12:46.431 --> 12:49.567
I am dr. Tim
"the tool man" taylor,"

12:49.568 --> 12:54.171
And you all know my assistant -
al "ma mater" borland.

12:54.172 --> 12:57.941
Yesterday, we talked
about getting insects
out of your house.

12:57.942 --> 12:59.943
And if that didn't bug ya,

12:59.944 --> 13:02.313
Today we're gonna talk about
rodent removal.

13:02.314 --> 13:05.783
We're gonna meet the man
who has a job no one else wants.

13:05.784 --> 13:08.619
Actually, tim,
I have that job.

13:12.291 --> 13:15.426
Let's do a warm
<i>tool time</i> welcome to the man
who calls himself...

13:15.427 --> 13:17.428
<i>(like arnold schwarzenegger)</i>
...The verminator.

13:17.429 --> 13:20.231
Duke miller, come on out.

13:26.205 --> 13:29.673
Congratulations on your ph.D.
Thank you very much, duke.

13:29.674 --> 13:33.177
I myself attended
a state-certified
rodent extermination school.

13:33.178 --> 13:37.415
Yeah? Where'd you go,
ratcliffe?

13:37.416 --> 13:40.951
No, but we did play them
in football.

13:44.223 --> 13:48.292
So, anyway, what
got you interested
in extermination?

13:48.293 --> 13:51.996
Well, al, I've always
loved animals.

13:53.832 --> 13:56.399
Why don't you show
the studio audience
and everybody at home

13:56.400 --> 13:59.036
Some of the tools
of the trade?
Sure thing.

13:59.037 --> 14:02.606
Now, displayed here on the wall
we have your basic glue boards.

14:02.607 --> 14:04.708
Use these at home.
They're very effective.

14:04.709 --> 14:08.145
Mm-hmm. Now,
these look to me to be
some type of a snap trap.

14:08.146 --> 14:11.115
That's right. They come in
a variety of sizes

14:11.116 --> 14:15.486
And accommodate both domestic
and imported cheeses.

14:17.655 --> 14:20.891
Next, we have
a more sophisticated
kind of trap.

14:20.892 --> 14:23.294
I see that. Vic, if you
wanna come in here.

14:23.295 --> 14:25.629
Looks like a double-hinged
door there,

14:25.630 --> 14:29.400
A large eating area,
and little glass skylights.

14:29.401 --> 14:31.468
Ha-ha-ha.

14:31.469 --> 14:34.205
Mice have a better pad
than you do, al.

14:36.241 --> 14:38.242
Now, these are actually
humane traps.

14:38.243 --> 14:41.379
The mouse doesn't get killed.
You can make him a pet.

14:41.380 --> 14:46.884
So the mouse goes in
the little door here - aah.

14:46.885 --> 14:48.218
Aah!

14:55.260 --> 14:57.427
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

15:01.332 --> 15:04.268
This is it.
Sangren hall.

15:04.269 --> 15:06.570
Seems like it was yesterday
I was shooting spit wads
into the ceiling.

15:06.571 --> 15:08.906
Now I'm getting a ph.D.

15:08.907 --> 15:11.575
And we are so pleased
for you, aren't we, boys?

15:11.576 --> 15:13.143
<i>(all, unenthused)</i>
pleased, yeah.

15:14.612 --> 15:17.280
Honey, isn't this
where you and I
took sociology together?

15:17.281 --> 15:19.282
Yeah. I got my first "a"
in that class.

15:19.283 --> 15:21.585
Dad, what'd you get?
A lot of sleep.

15:23.021 --> 15:26.157
Dad, are all these people
getting fake degrees?

15:26.158 --> 15:28.793
No. Most of these people
had to work years to get 'em.

15:28.794 --> 15:30.026
Chumps. Ha-ha.

15:31.496 --> 15:34.097
Dad, where's the bathroom?

15:34.098 --> 15:37.301
I believe it's still
down that hallway back there.

15:37.302 --> 15:39.337
When you get in there,

15:39.338 --> 15:42.272
See if your mom
is still mentioned
in stall four.

15:42.273 --> 15:44.842
Hey, does everybody know
what time it is?

15:44.843 --> 15:46.810
Ph.D. Time.

15:46.811 --> 15:49.280
Ha-ha, it's great
to see you again, tim.

15:49.281 --> 15:51.749
And you would be?

15:51.750 --> 15:54.618
Your old philosophy teacher -
professor garver.

15:54.619 --> 15:56.120
Ah, yes, philosophy.

15:56.121 --> 15:59.723
"I think, therefore I am."
descartes.

15:59.724 --> 16:01.525
Pretty good for a guy
who was never in class.

16:01.526 --> 16:04.962
I thought I was there,
therefore I probably was.

16:07.265 --> 16:11.969
I passed you,
therefore you're lucky.

16:11.970 --> 16:13.203
Ha-ha-ha.

16:13.204 --> 16:14.772
Prof, this is
my wife jill.

16:14.773 --> 16:16.540
How do you do?
It's nice to meet you.

16:16.541 --> 16:18.542
You must be very thrilled
for tim.

16:18.543 --> 16:21.645
Oh, thrilled doesn't begin
to describe how I feel.

16:21.646 --> 16:25.081
Ecstatic beyond belief.
Really, really proud.

16:25.082 --> 16:27.050
We all are.
Excuse me.

16:27.051 --> 16:30.053
Proud, proud, proud.

16:30.054 --> 16:32.055
Going a little overboard
with this, aren't ya?

16:32.056 --> 16:34.057
I'm sorry. I'm trying
to be supportive.

16:34.058 --> 16:36.427
I know this is honorary,
but it means a lot to me.

16:36.428 --> 16:39.263
Hi, tim.
Barbara besson.

16:39.264 --> 16:41.431
I'm on the fund-raising
committee at western.

16:41.432 --> 16:43.467
Hi there.
This is my wife jill.

16:43.468 --> 16:45.903
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

16:45.904 --> 16:48.105
Oh, tim, it's really great
to have you back here.

16:48.106 --> 16:50.074
It's really great
to be allowed back here.

16:50.075 --> 16:54.211
Ha-ha-ha-ha. You are
gonna do fantastic things
for this university.

16:54.212 --> 16:56.346
I think we're gonna be able
to build the new library

16:56.347 --> 16:58.516
With all the donations
you'll help us get.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.050
What are you talking about?

17:00.051 --> 17:02.653
Well, you're a big celebrity
in the construction world,

17:02.654 --> 17:04.954
And we'll be able to use you
to solicit contributions

17:04.955 --> 17:07.023
From the
building community.

17:07.025 --> 17:08.492
Solicit contributions.

17:08.492 --> 17:10.961
Mm, and he'll be
wonderful at it.

17:10.962 --> 17:13.297
That's why I really
pushed to have him
get this doctorate.

17:13.298 --> 17:15.298
Some members of the committee

17:15.299 --> 17:17.300
Wanted to give it
to an award-winning poet.

17:17.300 --> 17:20.569
Like he could help us
raise a dime. Ha-ha-ha.

17:23.775 --> 17:27.010
But that's not the only reason
you're giving tim the degree.

17:27.011 --> 17:28.913
They appreciate
<i>tool time,</i> right?

17:28.914 --> 17:30.347
<i>Tool time?</i>

17:30.348 --> 17:32.115
My show.

17:32.116 --> 17:35.853
Oh, yes. I've never
seen it, but I hear
it's very cute.

17:35.854 --> 17:37.687
I'll see you
at the podium.
Yeah.

17:37.688 --> 17:40.290
Cute, real cute.
Feel like an idiot.

17:40.291 --> 17:42.492
I feel like
an idiot.

17:42.493 --> 17:45.128
The only reason I'm here is
because they want a celebrity
to help them solicit funds.

17:45.129 --> 17:48.498
Hey, hey, she just is from
the fund-raising committee.

17:48.499 --> 17:51.368
She doesn't represent
everybody at western.

17:51.369 --> 17:54.371
Look, even if they are
just giving this to you
because you're a celebrity,

17:54.372 --> 17:56.640
You wouldn't be a celebrity
if you didn't have a great show.

17:56.641 --> 18:00.377
Binford hired you
because you did so well
in engineering at western.

18:00.378 --> 18:01.545
You believe that?

18:01.546 --> 18:03.880
Yes, I do.
I'm sorry. I...

18:03.881 --> 18:06.684
I should've been
more supportive all along.

18:06.685 --> 18:09.520
I was feeling jealous
because it's gonna be
so many years

18:09.521 --> 18:11.555
Until I get my doctorate.

18:11.556 --> 18:14.825
The presentation of the ph.D.S
is about to begin.

18:14.826 --> 18:16.960
By the time
I get my ph.D.,

18:16.961 --> 18:20.197
I'll be too old to remember
what ph.D. Stands for.

18:20.198 --> 18:22.165
Don't feel bad.
I'm just about
to get one,

18:22.166 --> 18:25.369
And I still don't know
what it stands for.

18:26.904 --> 18:28.739
Knock 'em dead.

18:33.144 --> 18:36.880
Now we'd like to present
this year's honorary doctorate

18:36.881 --> 18:39.216
To an alumnus -
class of '76.

18:39.217 --> 18:41.985
A man who, day in and day out,

18:41.986 --> 18:46.756
Teaches people that,
with the right tools,

18:46.757 --> 18:49.926
Anything is possible.

18:49.927 --> 18:51.528
Let's give a warm

18:51.529 --> 18:54.331
Western michigan university
welcome

18:54.332 --> 18:59.336
To tim "the tool man" taylor.

19:05.576 --> 19:08.011
Professor hankey.

19:08.012 --> 19:09.847
Thank you.

19:10.782 --> 19:12.382
Ahem.

19:12.383 --> 19:14.418
Thank you all.

19:14.419 --> 19:16.853
I, uh... Oh, boy.

19:22.860 --> 19:25.029
Ahem.

19:25.030 --> 19:29.300
You know, the last time
I gave a speech at western,

19:29.301 --> 19:33.603
I was actually
in the dean's office.
Remember that?

19:33.604 --> 19:35.973
Trying to convince her
to not kick me out of school.

19:35.974 --> 19:39.143
I had those women's underpants
on my head.

19:39.144 --> 19:42.880
It was frat week.
It was a long time ago.

19:42.881 --> 19:44.915
He's dyin'.

19:46.885 --> 19:49.319
You know, my dad
taught me years ago

19:49.320 --> 19:52.622
That a tool in your hands
keeps those hands
out of trouble.

19:52.623 --> 19:54.791
What this university taught me

19:54.792 --> 19:58.161
Was that education is perhaps
the greatest tool of 'em all.

19:58.162 --> 20:00.931
Of course, my first
couple years here,

20:00.932 --> 20:04.268
I thought a corkscrew
was the best tool...

20:06.571 --> 20:10.607
But seriously, I want
you all to know how much
I appreciate this award.

20:10.608 --> 20:12.443
I really do.

20:12.444 --> 20:15.345
I also want you to know
I have nothing but respect
for all of you

20:15.346 --> 20:18.348
Who have put in years of work
to earn an advanced degree -

20:18.349 --> 20:21.085
One student out there
in particular -

20:21.086 --> 20:25.055
So here is to
higher education.

20:29.261 --> 20:31.061
Let me help you.

20:31.062 --> 20:33.263
Uh, watch your hand
on that.

20:33.264 --> 20:35.733
Aah!

20:40.971 --> 20:44.508
I know how she feels,
I'll tell ya that.

20:46.777 --> 20:50.480
But that kinda felt good there
just at the beginning of that.
I've been there.

20:54.452 --> 20:58.588
Uh, I suppose you wanna
see me in your office.

21:01.726 --> 21:04.028
Well, it's time once again
to dip into the ol' mailbag.

21:04.029 --> 21:06.030
Heidi, the mailbag,
please.

21:06.031 --> 21:08.465
I bet your anxious
to read all those letters

21:08.466 --> 21:10.600
Congratulating you
on your ph.D.?

21:10.601 --> 21:13.904
I don't think we'll have time
to read them all, al.

21:17.608 --> 21:19.276
I think we might.

21:26.684 --> 21:28.919
Todd from toledo writes,

21:28.920 --> 21:30.854
"dear tim, when I heard
you were getting a ph.D.,

21:30.855 --> 21:34.191
Three words came to mind -
why not al?"

21:44.268 --> 21:48.004
Thanks, todd. "he's the one
who works his tail off
day in, day out.

21:48.005 --> 21:50.674
"it's time for america
to stand up and cheer
for albert borland,

21:50.675 --> 21:53.444
Who slaves..."
I can't read this, todd.

21:53.445 --> 21:55.212
Tirelessly.

22:01.118 --> 22:03.654
How did you know
what that said?

22:03.655 --> 22:05.121
I guessed.

22:08.193 --> 22:09.560
Did you,

22:09.561 --> 22:12.596
Or is it possible
that albert borland

22:12.597 --> 22:16.433
Is todd from toledo?

22:17.268 --> 22:20.871
How could you stoop
to something so dumb?

22:20.872 --> 22:23.440
I don't know.

22:23.441 --> 22:25.042
But there's no use

22:25.043 --> 22:27.644
Reading this letter
from andy from akron.

22:41.292 --> 22:44.661
Actually, uh,
mr. Smarty flannel,

22:44.662 --> 22:46.863
This is - further from
the truth - here, look.

22:46.864 --> 22:49.966
"dear t..." ha-ha-ha-ha.

22:51.235 --> 22:52.735
The voice.

22:52.736 --> 22:54.637
<i>(gibberish)</i>

22:54.638 --> 22:56.206
<i>(gibberish)</i>
