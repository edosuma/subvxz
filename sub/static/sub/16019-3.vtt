WEBVTT

00:03.462 --> 00:05.506
Happy Thanksgiving, Chloe!

00:05.547 --> 00:07.675
Do you want me to make you

00:05.547 --> 00:07.675
my traditional turkey--

00:07.716 --> 00:09.343
Uh, this is Chloe's

00:07.716 --> 00:09.343
Thanksgiving tradition.

00:09.384 --> 00:10.719
She calls all of

00:09.384 --> 00:10.719
her married lovers

00:10.761 --> 00:12.053
while they're home

00:10.761 --> 00:12.053
with their families

00:12.095 --> 00:13.681
to freak 'em out.

00:12.095 --> 00:13.681
(phone rings)

00:13.722 --> 00:16.725
(singsongy)

00:13.722 --> 00:16.725
Gobble, gobble!

00:13.722 --> 00:16.725
Is your wife home?

00:16.767 --> 00:18.560
'Cause I'm wearing

00:16.767 --> 00:18.560
her t-shirt right now.

00:16.767 --> 00:18.560
MAN: Wait-- What?

00:18.602 --> 00:20.855
Hey, Harold!

00:18.602 --> 00:20.855
Did you see the parade?

00:20.896 --> 00:21.939
(inhales sharply)

00:20.896 --> 00:21.939
Get tested.

00:21.981 --> 00:23.106
(man crying)

00:23.148 --> 00:26.234
Oh, hey, Todd, real quick--

00:23.148 --> 00:26.234
While you're eating,

00:26.276 --> 00:27.987
your baby will be

00:26.276 --> 00:27.987
growing inside me.

00:26.276 --> 00:27.987
MAN: No! I--

00:28.028 --> 00:30.531
Hey, Tyrone,

00:28.028 --> 00:30.531
Happy Turkey Day.

00:30.572 --> 00:33.074
Did you tell your wife yet

00:30.572 --> 00:33.074
that you prefer white meat?

00:33.116 --> 00:35.076
MAN: Wait, no, no, no,

00:33.116 --> 00:35.076
no, no, no.

00:35.118 --> 00:37.454

00:35.118 --> 00:37.454

Chloe,

00:48.131 --> 00:50.091
you ruined Thanksgiving

00:48.131 --> 00:50.091
for those men.

00:50.133 --> 00:51.134
Don't you feel bad?

00:51.176 --> 00:52.970
They're hypocrites.

00:53.012 --> 00:55.096
Pretending to be family

00:53.012 --> 00:55.096
men one day a year,

00:55.138 --> 00:56.473
and then sleeping

00:55.138 --> 00:56.473
around the rest?

00:56.515 --> 00:57.474
This whole holiday is

00:56.515 --> 00:57.474
fake--

00:57.516 --> 00:59.518
people pretending

00:57.516 --> 00:59.518
to like each other,

00:59.560 --> 01:01.812
everyone thinking

00:59.560 --> 01:01.812
it's okay to wear Uggs.

01:01.854 --> 01:04.523
What? Thanksgiving

01:01.854 --> 01:04.523
is a wonderful holiday.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.316
I was gonna fly home to

01:04.565 --> 01:06.316
Indiana to be with my family,

01:06.358 --> 01:08.109
but I couldn't afford

01:06.358 --> 01:08.109
the flight.

01:08.151 --> 01:09.737
You could sell

01:08.151 --> 01:09.737
your uterus.

01:09.778 --> 01:11.405
I got a guy.

01:09.778 --> 01:11.405
Next year.

01:11.446 --> 01:13.198
(door opens)

01:13.240 --> 01:14.909
Happy Fat America Day.

01:14.950 --> 01:17.619
Luther and I are on our way

01:14.950 --> 01:17.619
to volunteer at a soup kitchen.

01:17.661 --> 01:18.829
I don't wanna

01:17.661 --> 01:18.829
look too nice.

01:18.871 --> 01:20.121
I wanna borrow something

01:18.871 --> 01:20.121
that's, you know,

01:20.163 --> 01:21.916
kind of "of the people."

01:21.957 --> 01:23.124
Oh, you're volunteering?

01:23.166 --> 01:25.126
That's exactly what

01:23.166 --> 01:25.126
I was gonna do today.

01:25.168 --> 01:28.213
I-- Oh. Okay.

01:25.168 --> 01:28.213
(laughs)

01:28.255 --> 01:29.631
It's so rewarding.

01:29.673 --> 01:30.632
Helping those in need--

01:30.674 --> 01:31.967
Oh, that looks

01:30.674 --> 01:31.967
really nice--

01:32.009 --> 01:33.427
is a Colburn

01:32.009 --> 01:33.427
Thanksgiving tradition.

01:33.468 --> 01:36.931
You know, and if I can't

01:33.468 --> 01:36.931
be home to do it,

01:36.972 --> 01:38.807
maybe I should just go along

01:36.972 --> 01:38.807
with you guys. Is that okay?

01:38.849 --> 01:40.976
Do you have a reservation

01:38.849 --> 01:40.976
at the shelter?

01:41.018 --> 01:42.853
You need a reservation

01:41.018 --> 01:42.853
to help people?

01:42.895 --> 01:44.145
(laughs)

01:44.187 --> 01:45.313
Indiana.

01:44.187 --> 01:45.313
Fly-over state.

01:45.355 --> 01:46.147
Biscuits.

01:46.189 --> 01:47.566
June, the 78th

01:46.189 --> 01:47.566
Street Shelter

01:47.608 --> 01:49.818
is the most exclusive

01:47.608 --> 01:49.818
in the city.

01:49.860 --> 01:51.862
You need a reservation if

01:49.860 --> 01:51.862
you want  People  magazine

01:51.904 --> 01:53.822
to take your picture

01:51.904 --> 01:53.822
with photogenic homeless.

01:53.864 --> 01:55.156
I put my name in

01:53.864 --> 01:55.156
a year ago.

01:55.198 --> 01:58.159
And he's

01:55.198 --> 01:58.159
James Van Der Beek.

01:58.201 --> 02:01.246
What have I told you about

01:58.201 --> 02:01.246
where to put the emphasis?

02:02.081 --> 02:03.331
Ugh!

02:03.373 --> 02:06.167
First Christmas card came.

02:03.373 --> 02:06.167
Guess who from.

02:06.209 --> 02:08.837
My dad and Karen.

02:08.879 --> 02:11.966
Of course, she's making

02:08.879 --> 02:11.966
him crouch down.

02:12.007 --> 02:13.425
I don't really think

02:12.007 --> 02:13.425
that she has a... choice.

02:13.467 --> 02:16.261
This is exactly why I'm

02:13.467 --> 02:16.261
not going home today.

02:16.303 --> 02:19.014
My mom's gonna put on

02:16.303 --> 02:19.014
a show for her guests,

02:19.056 --> 02:21.016
but everyone knows

02:19.056 --> 02:21.016
it's a Thanksgiving lie

02:21.058 --> 02:22.183
because they've been

02:21.058 --> 02:22.183
having a hard time

02:22.225 --> 02:23.602
ever since my dad cheated

02:22.225 --> 02:23.602
on her with some whore.

02:23.644 --> 02:26.855
That was... that was me.

02:23.644 --> 02:26.855
You set me up with your father.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.356
I'm the... whore.

02:28.398 --> 02:29.232
Right!

02:28.398 --> 02:29.232
Yeah.

02:29.274 --> 02:30.651
I forgot. Funny.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.820
Because on the surface,

02:30.692 --> 02:32.820
you don't look like a whore.

02:40.285 --> 02:41.996
(singsongy)

02:40.285 --> 02:41.996
Happy Thanksgiving.

02:42.037 --> 02:43.204
May I offer you

02:42.037 --> 02:43.204
a baked good?

02:43.246 --> 02:45.916
I'm doing gluten-free

02:43.246 --> 02:45.916
right now.

02:45.958 --> 02:49.210
Good for you.

02:45.958 --> 02:49.210
I tried doing vegan for a week.

02:49.252 --> 02:51.212
No energy. I couldn't even

02:49.252 --> 02:51.212
make it to the gym.

02:51.254 --> 02:54.091
Yeah, that must

02:51.254 --> 02:54.091
have been hard for you.

02:54.133 --> 02:55.676
I only have one foot.

02:57.094 --> 02:58.512
I like your sock.

03:01.264 --> 03:03.224
Thank you

03:01.264 --> 03:03.224
for volunteering today.

03:03.266 --> 03:04.392
If you have any problems,

03:04.434 --> 03:05.686
Reggie and Mike

03:04.434 --> 03:05.686
will take care of you.

03:05.727 --> 03:06.937
Fantastic.

03:08.313 --> 03:09.397
Showtime.

03:09.439 --> 03:10.482
There he is.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.109
Hello, friends.

03:12.151 --> 03:13.360
Would you care for

03:12.151 --> 03:13.360
some delicious gravy?

03:13.944 --> 03:15.112
Nice.

03:15.154 --> 03:16.864
This is what it's

03:15.154 --> 03:16.864
all about, isn't it?

03:16.905 --> 03:18.448
Sharing with those in need,

03:18.490 --> 03:20.241
giving of one's self

03:18.490 --> 03:20.241
so that you can...

03:18.490 --> 03:20.241
MAN: Hey, is that an Olsen?

03:20.283 --> 03:21.242
MAN: Mary-Kate!

03:20.283 --> 03:21.242
MAN: Ashley!

03:21.284 --> 03:23.954
Okay, that's a wrap.

03:21.284 --> 03:23.954
Fantastic.

03:23.996 --> 03:26.205
Thank you.

03:23.996 --> 03:26.205
You guys were great.

03:23.996 --> 03:26.205
Ta-ta!

03:28.207 --> 03:29.543
(bell dings)

03:32.379 --> 03:35.090
Oh, hi!

03:32.379 --> 03:35.090
Happy Thanksgiving.

03:35.132 --> 03:36.925
My name is June.

03:35.132 --> 03:36.925
I live in apartment 23.

03:36.967 --> 03:38.259
May I help you

03:36.967 --> 03:38.259
with your groceries?

03:38.301 --> 03:39.344
Rape!

03:39.386 --> 03:40.721
What? No.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.472
Rape!

03:42.514 --> 03:43.932
I was just trying

03:42.514 --> 03:43.932
to help you!

03:43.974 --> 03:46.476
Some lady is raping my wife!

03:46.518 --> 03:47.728
Rape!

03:47.769 --> 03:49.270
(door opens)

03:49.312 --> 03:50.647
Um...

03:50.689 --> 03:53.692
I just ran into

03:50.689 --> 03:53.692
Mrs. Hochberg in the hall.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.360
Did you, like,

03:53.734 --> 03:55.360
rape her or something?

03:55.402 --> 03:57.320
No. They thought I was,

03:55.402 --> 03:57.320
but I wasn't.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.198
I'm not attracted

03:57.362 --> 03:59.198
to either one of them.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.908
Really? 'Cause I bet

03:59.239 --> 04:00.908
back in the day,

04:00.949 --> 04:02.159
she was something special.

04:02.201 --> 04:05.286
(scoffs) This has been

04:02.201 --> 04:05.286
the worst Thanksgiving

04:05.328 --> 04:06.538
in my entire life.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.165
I haven't been able

04:06.580 --> 04:08.165
to find anyone to help,

04:08.207 --> 04:10.291
and I can't afford

04:08.207 --> 04:10.291
to be home with my family.

04:10.333 --> 04:11.251
I know who you should help--

04:12.169 --> 04:14.295
the Native Americans.

04:14.337 --> 04:16.215
Let's go to an Indian casino

04:16.256 --> 04:18.466
and drink white wine

04:16.256 --> 04:18.466
with the Cherokee!

04:18.508 --> 04:20.010
On Thanksgiving?

04:20.052 --> 04:22.303
You-- you don't think that's

04:20.052 --> 04:22.303
a little bit insensitive?

04:22.345 --> 04:23.597
No. We're helping.

04:23.638 --> 04:25.348
We're starting

04:23.638 --> 04:25.348
the healing process.

04:25.390 --> 04:27.308
And, June, the way

04:25.390 --> 04:27.308
you suck at Blackjack,

04:27.350 --> 04:28.185
you could change

04:27.350 --> 04:28.185
a lot of lives.

04:28.227 --> 04:29.561
I don't suck at Blackjack.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.312
I just don't play

04:29.603 --> 04:31.312
the way that you do.

04:31.354 --> 04:32.606
Nobody takes the insurance.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.524
I don't like

04:32.647 --> 04:34.524
being unprotected!

04:40.614 --> 04:43.324
Hey, Chloe,

04:40.614 --> 04:43.324
just so you're not shocked,

04:43.366 --> 04:45.326
I like to play

04:43.366 --> 04:45.326
two slot machines at once.

04:45.368 --> 04:46.995
So I'll be all like,

04:45.368 --> 04:46.995
"Bap-bap-bap-bap-bap."

04:47.037 --> 04:49.330
Yeah. You should

04:47.037 --> 04:49.330
totally do that.

04:49.372 --> 04:50.958
Why aren't we

04:49.372 --> 04:50.958
at the casino?

04:50.999 --> 04:53.835
Uh, that was a Thanksgiving lie.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.835
We're at my parents' house.

04:53.877 --> 04:56.337
We're just gonna go in

04:53.877 --> 04:56.337
for a quick five-course meal,

04:56.379 --> 04:57.464
we'll be done

04:56.379 --> 04:57.464
in nine hours, max.

04:57.589 --> 04:59.841
Nine hours? That is gonna

04:57.589 --> 04:59.841
bleed into Black Friday.

04:59.883 --> 05:01.342
June, you can have sex

04:59.883 --> 05:01.342
with black men

05:01.384 --> 05:02.385
any day of the week.

05:07.390 --> 05:08.850
What are we doing

05:07.390 --> 05:08.850
at your parents' house?

05:08.892 --> 05:10.560
You said that families

05:10.602 --> 05:13.188
put aside their problems

05:10.602 --> 05:13.188
for one day of the year,

05:13.230 --> 05:14.522
and I got to thinking,

05:14.564 --> 05:16.524
since my parents

05:14.564 --> 05:16.524
are back together,

05:16.566 --> 05:18.359
I'm gonna try and spend

05:16.566 --> 05:18.359
some real time with them,

05:18.401 --> 05:19.611
and I can't do it

05:18.401 --> 05:19.611
without you.

05:19.653 --> 05:20.779
Why me? I...

05:20.821 --> 05:22.363
(lowered voice)

05:20.821 --> 05:22.363
made out with your father!

05:22.405 --> 05:24.658
June, you're the first

05:22.405 --> 05:24.658
normal person I've met.

05:24.699 --> 05:27.577
You can help me

05:24.699 --> 05:27.577
have a normal Thanksgiving.

05:27.619 --> 05:30.998
Come on. You wanna help

05:27.619 --> 05:30.998
somebody this Thanksgiving?

05:31.039 --> 05:31.999
Help me.

05:33.125 --> 05:34.793
Okay. Okay.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.795
I will help you.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.795
I will put aside

05:36.837 --> 05:38.297
all this weird stuff

05:36.837 --> 05:38.297
with your father,

05:38.337 --> 05:40.381
and I will help you

05:38.337 --> 05:40.381
navigate this special day.

05:40.423 --> 05:43.802
I will be your

05:40.423 --> 05:43.802
emotional Sacagawea.

05:43.844 --> 05:44.678
Great!

05:44.719 --> 05:45.637
All right.

05:45.679 --> 05:46.763
Wait! June, wait.

05:46.805 --> 05:48.389
No, you can't just

05:46.805 --> 05:48.389
walk into the house.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.433
Are you crazy? My mom knows

05:48.431 --> 05:50.433
you almost porked my dad.

05:50.475 --> 05:51.852
She does? Wait, why?

05:51.893 --> 05:53.270
I had to tell her.

05:53.312 --> 05:54.646
She thought it was

05:53.312 --> 05:54.646
someone her own age,

05:54.688 --> 05:56.397
not some sweet

05:54.688 --> 05:56.397
young  thang.

05:56.439 --> 05:58.399
You can't hand me a sledgehammer

05:56.439 --> 05:58.399
and expect me not to swing it.

05:58.441 --> 06:00.401
(door squeaks)

06:02.863 --> 06:04.281
(grunts)

06:09.703 --> 06:11.788
Okay. Hop in.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.788
What?

06:11.830 --> 06:14.833
This is the only way to level

06:11.830 --> 06:14.833
the playing field with her.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.793
She'll replace her anger

06:14.875 --> 06:16.793
with kinship.

06:16.835 --> 06:19.129
This chair is

06:16.835 --> 06:19.129
the great equalizer.

06:19.171 --> 06:20.421
This is crazy!

06:20.463 --> 06:22.299
I can't pretend

06:20.463 --> 06:22.299
to be in a wheelchair

06:22.341 --> 06:25.093
in front of your mother,

06:22.341 --> 06:25.093
who is actually in a

06:22.341 --> 06:25.093
wheelchair.

06:25.135 --> 06:26.720
Besides,

06:25.135 --> 06:26.720
she's seen me,

06:26.761 --> 06:28.805
and she knows

06:26.761 --> 06:28.805
that my legs work!

06:28.847 --> 06:31.432
I told her that you were in a

06:28.847 --> 06:31.432
horseback riding accident.

06:31.474 --> 06:34.311
Your horse saw a snake,

06:31.474 --> 06:34.311
it reared up

06:34.353 --> 06:35.436
and tossed

06:34.353 --> 06:35.436
you on a rock,

06:35.478 --> 06:37.356
and you shattered

06:35.478 --> 06:37.356
your pelvis in 60

06:35.478 --> 06:37.356
places.

06:37.438 --> 06:39.440
60 places?

06:39.482 --> 06:41.442
Oh, my god. The doctor

06:39.482 --> 06:41.442
bills must have been--

06:41.484 --> 06:42.443
You know what?

06:42.485 --> 06:45.072
It's not real.

06:42.485 --> 06:45.072
Come on, Sacagawea.

06:45.113 --> 06:46.447
I need you.

06:45.113 --> 06:46.447
(moans)

06:46.489 --> 06:49.284
Please!

06:50.202 --> 06:51.452
Well, I hate lying,

06:51.494 --> 06:53.454
especially on

06:51.494 --> 06:53.454
Turkey Day.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.456
But if this is

06:53.496 --> 06:55.456
the only way

06:55.498 --> 06:56.457
that you can

06:55.498 --> 06:56.457
reconnect--

06:56.499 --> 06:58.293
Great!

06:56.499 --> 06:58.293
I will-- Oh, god, wait.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.128
Wait. Hold on.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.128
But what about my horse?

07:00.170 --> 07:01.462
What was his name?

07:00.170 --> 07:01.462
You didn't tell me.

07:01.504 --> 07:02.797
I don't know

07:01.504 --> 07:02.797
what to do!

07:02.923 --> 07:04.507
(doorbell rings)

07:02.923 --> 07:04.507
Is it a Palomino?

07:02.923 --> 07:04.507
What if it comes up?

07:04.549 --> 07:06.968
Hey! Hi, you!

07:04.549 --> 07:06.968
(door squeaks)

07:07.010 --> 07:09.637
Who wants a welcome

07:07.010 --> 07:09.637
soup shot in their tummy?

07:09.679 --> 07:11.098
Shut your face, mom!

07:11.139 --> 07:12.099
Chloe,

07:12.140 --> 07:13.474
she's not trying

07:12.140 --> 07:13.474
to be rude to you.

07:13.516 --> 07:15.560
She's just trying to be nice.

07:13.516 --> 07:15.560
(scoffs) Fine. Whatever.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.562
She's always hated

07:15.602 --> 07:17.562
my welcome soup shots,

07:17.604 --> 07:18.646
even though

07:17.604 --> 07:18.646
she's never tried one.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.107
I'll try

07:18.688 --> 07:20.107
one in hell!

07:20.148 --> 07:21.482
Is that my princess?

07:21.524 --> 07:23.484
Hi, daddy! It is me!

07:23.526 --> 07:25.486
Hi! Mm.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.364
You guys remember June.

07:27.406 --> 07:28.198
Hello, June.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.783
You're looking...

07:29.824 --> 07:30.951
handsome.

07:34.621 --> 07:35.872
Hi, Karen.

07:35.914 --> 07:36.706
Come.

07:36.748 --> 07:38.499
Give me a hug.

07:38.541 --> 07:39.500
You mean...

07:39.542 --> 07:42.087
in our, uh...

07:39.542 --> 07:42.087
in our chairs?

07:42.129 --> 07:43.713
Oh, yes, dear,

07:42.129 --> 07:43.713
in our chairs.

07:43.755 --> 07:45.924
I am gonna give you tips

07:43.755 --> 07:45.924
I wish someone had given me

07:45.966 --> 07:47.508
when I was first in the chair.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.508
Wow.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.136
Now here's what's gonna happen.

07:49.177 --> 07:51.805
I'm gonna reach over,

07:49.177 --> 07:51.805
and I'm gonna set your brake.

07:49.177 --> 07:51.805
Ooh!

07:51.846 --> 07:55.309
I'm gonna scoot my weight

07:51.846 --> 07:55.309
to the end of my chair,

07:55.350 --> 07:57.978
and then I'm gonna extend

07:55.350 --> 07:57.978
my arms around you,

07:58.019 --> 08:01.315
and I'm gonna bring your body

07:58.019 --> 08:01.315
close to my body.

08:01.356 --> 08:02.523
Oh!

08:01.356 --> 08:02.523
Mm-hmm.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.234
We're hugging now.

08:04.276 --> 08:06.236
This is a hug.

08:08.571 --> 08:11.532
(exhales deeply) That got

08:08.571 --> 08:11.532
pretty real back there.

08:11.574 --> 08:14.453
I don't think I ever

08:11.574 --> 08:14.453
want to be homeless.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.121
We should buy that second house

08:14.494 --> 08:16.121
we've been talking about

08:16.163 --> 08:17.164
just so I have a backup.

08:17.205 --> 08:18.539
Sedona!

08:18.581 --> 08:20.375
(pounding on door)

08:22.210 --> 08:23.544
Oh, hey, guys.

08:23.586 --> 08:25.005
Clarence sent us

08:23.586 --> 08:25.005
to get you.

08:25.130 --> 08:26.798
You left before

08:25.130 --> 08:26.798
your shift was over.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.343
No. I-I came.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.343
I helped out.

08:29.384 --> 08:32.595
I-I signed two autographs

08:29.384 --> 08:32.595
for a bipolar prostitute.

08:32.637 --> 08:34.222
(laughs)

08:34.264 --> 08:38.352
That's... Luther, put that

08:34.264 --> 08:38.352
in the "perfect joke" file.

08:38.393 --> 08:39.560
All right.

08:39.602 --> 08:42.856
Celebrities like you always

08:39.602 --> 08:42.856
leave early on Thanksgiving.

08:42.897 --> 08:45.608
Mike, you think

08:42.897 --> 08:45.608
People  magazine

08:45.650 --> 08:47.486
would find it

08:45.650 --> 08:47.486
interesting to know

08:47.527 --> 08:49.946
that James Van Der Beek

08:47.527 --> 08:49.946
ladled and left?

08:49.988 --> 08:51.948
Very interesting,

08:49.988 --> 08:51.948
Reggie.

08:51.990 --> 08:53.158
No, no, no.

08:51.990 --> 08:53.158
We didn't leave.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.243
We-- we... we just

08:53.200 --> 08:55.243
had to come back,

08:55.285 --> 08:57.620
'cause-- 'cause we,

08:55.285 --> 08:57.620
uh, forgot...

08:57.662 --> 09:00.499
our... hats.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.418
(indistinct conversations,

09:00.540 --> 09:03.418
dishes clatter, baby crying)

09:03.460 --> 09:06.463
This is excruciating.

09:03.460 --> 09:06.463
How long have we been here?

09:06.505 --> 09:09.049
Ugh. 45 minutes.

09:10.717 --> 09:11.885
(clangs)

09:12.927 --> 09:14.554
(dribbles)

09:20.519 --> 09:21.520
(indistinct conversations)

09:21.561 --> 09:22.896
I have a present for you.

09:22.937 --> 09:25.023
Two hands on your wheels

09:25.065 --> 09:26.816
doesn't mean

09:25.065 --> 09:26.816
you can't still party.

09:26.858 --> 09:30.028
Oh, wow, that's really nice.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.071
You think that's nice?

09:31.112 --> 09:32.655
(singsongy)

09:31.112 --> 09:32.655
Wait till you see this.

09:33.698 --> 09:35.200
Oh, is that

09:33.698 --> 09:35.200
for my glasses?

09:35.242 --> 09:37.035
Nope, it's a Tampon holder.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.287
It's that "T" of the "M,"

09:39.329 --> 09:40.705
you need to go to the ladies',

09:40.747 --> 09:42.623
but you don't want to wheel

09:40.747 --> 09:42.623
all the way over

09:42.665 --> 09:44.459
to wherever

09:42.665 --> 09:44.459
you put your purse.

09:44.501 --> 09:46.461
Well, that is

09:44.501 --> 09:46.461
very thoughtful of you.

09:46.503 --> 09:47.837
Thank you for being

09:46.503 --> 09:47.837
so welcoming

09:47.879 --> 09:49.130
despite... everything.

09:49.172 --> 09:52.717
My motto is

09:49.172 --> 09:52.717
"Keep rolling forward."

09:55.678 --> 09:57.638
I don't understand

09:55.678 --> 09:57.638
what the problem is.

09:57.680 --> 09:58.806
I didn't do anything wrong.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.641
Could you excuse me

09:58.848 --> 10:00.641
for a second?

10:00.683 --> 10:01.642
I think I'm needed.

10:01.684 --> 10:02.643
Okay.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.312
Honey,

10:02.685 --> 10:04.312
you know you're pretty.

10:04.354 --> 10:05.688
You got it all going on.

10:05.730 --> 10:08.691
But sometimes guests,

10:05.730 --> 10:08.691
like my boss,

10:08.733 --> 10:10.651
can misconstrue it

10:08.733 --> 10:10.651
when you sit on their lap

10:10.693 --> 10:13.321
and feed them Ambrosia salad

10:10.693 --> 10:13.321
with your fingers.

10:13.363 --> 10:15.656
You put your fingers inside

10:13.363 --> 10:15.656
of your dad's boss' mouth?

10:15.698 --> 10:17.033
June,

10:17.075 --> 10:18.701
if there's a sexy piece

10:17.075 --> 10:18.701
of man-meat in front of me,

10:18.743 --> 10:20.036
I'm gonna want

10:18.743 --> 10:20.036
to eat it.

10:20.078 --> 10:21.455
Chloe...

10:21.496 --> 10:23.664
take a look at

10:21.496 --> 10:23.664
that sexy piece of man-meat

10:23.706 --> 10:25.833
without your intention

10:23.706 --> 10:25.833
of wanting to ruin the holiday,

10:25.875 --> 10:27.627
and let me know

10:25.875 --> 10:27.627
if you're still hungry.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.339
(indistinct conversations)

10:31.381 --> 10:34.134
Oh, my god. He looks

10:31.381 --> 10:34.134
like a giant cheesy poof.

10:34.175 --> 10:36.344
Good catch.

10:34.175 --> 10:36.344
That was a close one.

10:36.386 --> 10:38.221
That's what

10:36.386 --> 10:38.221
I'm here for.

10:39.180 --> 10:41.015
So, Scott,

10:39.180 --> 10:41.015
how have you been?

10:42.725 --> 10:45.812
Would you excuse me?

10:42.725 --> 10:45.812
I have to check on the turkey.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.566
I've been good, too.

10:49.608 --> 10:52.235
Just, uh, don't ask

10:49.608 --> 10:52.235
me to dance, 'cause

10:49.608 --> 10:52.235
I can't.

10:53.528 --> 10:55.696
(indistinct conversations)

10:55.738 --> 10:58.074
Oh, my god.

10:55.738 --> 10:58.074
This plate has been licked.

10:58.116 --> 10:58.908
All right, James.

10:58.950 --> 11:00.368
Lunch break.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.745
Where's Luther?

11:00.410 --> 11:02.745
I need him to make

11:00.410 --> 11:02.745
me a res at Babbo.

11:02.787 --> 11:06.291
Uh, we eat here...

11:02.787 --> 11:06.291
at the shelter.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.209
I don't wanna

11:06.333 --> 11:08.209
eat here.

11:16.468 --> 11:18.803
Pretty great to have all

11:16.468 --> 11:18.803
this food today, huh?

11:18.845 --> 11:21.348
Oh, yeah.

11:21.389 --> 11:22.723
Yeah, I used to get

11:21.389 --> 11:22.723
pretty hungry

11:22.765 --> 11:24.601
back when my mom

11:22.765 --> 11:24.601
first got put in jail,

11:24.643 --> 11:26.645
and the only soft

11:24.643 --> 11:26.645
thing in my life

11:26.685 --> 11:28.229
was a trash bag

11:26.685 --> 11:28.229
filled with old pillows.

11:28.271 --> 11:31.650
My grandma hoped

11:28.271 --> 11:31.650
a pet would help me

11:28.271 --> 11:31.650
get through it.

11:31.690 --> 11:33.734
So she got me what she

11:31.690 --> 11:33.734
thought was a hamster.

11:33.776 --> 11:36.196
(thinking)  My god...

11:36.237 --> 11:39.574
how long have I been chewing

11:36.237 --> 11:39.574
on this turkey?

11:39.616 --> 11:41.576
Feels like forever.

11:41.618 --> 11:43.744
Wait. Is that a tendon?

11:43.786 --> 11:46.747
Oh, my god,

11:43.786 --> 11:46.747
I-I can't eat a tendon.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.166
I need to spit this out

11:46.789 --> 11:48.166
into a napkin,

11:48.208 --> 11:50.751
but the sad kid

11:48.208 --> 11:50.751
keeps on looking at me.

11:50.793 --> 11:54.255
Maybe I can wash it down

11:50.793 --> 11:54.255
with orange drink.

11:54.297 --> 11:55.798
There's lipstick on that cup.

11:55.840 --> 11:56.966
Oh, my god.

11:57.008 --> 12:00.094
They're reusing cups.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.140
Yoo-hoo! Hi.

12:04.182 --> 12:05.975
Down here.

12:06.017 --> 12:08.769
Oh! Hey, June, I didn't

12:06.017 --> 12:08.769
see you down there.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.813
Yeah. Or in the hallway

12:08.811 --> 12:10.813
or the TV room.

12:10.855 --> 12:13.358
Anyway, uh, listen,

12:13.400 --> 12:14.775
I know this is

12:13.400 --> 12:14.775
a little awkward.

12:14.817 --> 12:17.612
But, um, Karen and I seem

12:14.817 --> 12:17.612
to be getting along great.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.239
And you and I

12:17.654 --> 12:19.239
don't have to pretend

12:19.280 --> 12:20.448
like we don't

12:19.280 --> 12:20.448
know each other.

12:20.490 --> 12:21.949
I mean, the last

12:20.490 --> 12:21.949
time I saw you,

12:21.991 --> 12:25.495
my toes were

12:21.991 --> 12:25.495
in your mouth.

12:25.537 --> 12:26.621
Oh! That

12:25.537 --> 12:26.621
was the timer.

12:26.663 --> 12:28.789
I have to check

12:26.663 --> 12:28.789
something in the kitchen.

12:28.831 --> 12:30.791
Hey. That is not

12:28.831 --> 12:30.791
where the kitchen is!

12:30.833 --> 12:33.461
I know what you're doing--

12:30.833 --> 12:33.461
Oh.

12:33.503 --> 12:37.465
God. This rug

12:33.503 --> 12:37.465
is like a swamp.

12:45.306 --> 12:46.765
Oh, god.

12:47.850 --> 12:50.645
Yep, stairs can

12:47.850 --> 12:50.645
be tricky.

12:50.687 --> 12:52.855
Mm. Here's what's gonna happen.

12:52.897 --> 12:56.526
I'm gonna reach

12:52.897 --> 12:56.526
over. (sighs) And I'm

12:52.897 --> 12:56.526
gonna set your brake.

12:56.568 --> 13:00.321
I'm gonna slip my right hand

12:56.568 --> 13:00.321
under your left buttock,

13:00.363 --> 13:01.740
and I'm gonna heft

13:00.363 --> 13:01.740
your weight...

13:01.780 --> 13:04.284
(strained voice) from one chair

13:01.780 --> 13:04.284
to the other. Okay.

13:04.325 --> 13:05.410
Okay. Good girl.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.704
Oh, beautiful.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.704
Beautiful. You all right?

13:07.746 --> 13:08.663
Yes.

13:07.746 --> 13:08.663
(beeps)

13:08.705 --> 13:09.997
Et voila.

13:10.039 --> 13:11.249
(whirring)

13:11.291 --> 13:12.833
Seriously?

13:12.875 --> 13:16.795
I've got a knitting

13:12.875 --> 13:16.795
project in the side

13:12.875 --> 13:16.795
pouch. Feel free.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.266
See you

13:26.473 --> 13:28.266
downstairs!

13:28.308 --> 13:29.934
Hey-- Oh...

13:28.308 --> 13:29.934
(beeps)

13:29.976 --> 13:31.478
June, where the

13:29.976 --> 13:31.478
hell have you been?

13:31.519 --> 13:33.062
I've been trying to

13:31.519 --> 13:33.062
talk to your father,

13:33.104 --> 13:34.731
but he's acting

13:33.104 --> 13:34.731
like a child.

13:34.773 --> 13:37.108
(scoffs) Well, my mom

13:34.773 --> 13:37.108
just said she likes

13:34.773 --> 13:37.108
my hair down,

13:37.150 --> 13:38.151
so obviously,

13:37.150 --> 13:38.151
I put it up.

13:38.192 --> 13:39.736
How do you make

13:38.192 --> 13:39.736
this thing go down?

13:39.778 --> 13:42.238
Are you even listening

13:39.778 --> 13:42.238
to me? This is red

13:39.778 --> 13:42.238
hour, June!

13:42.280 --> 13:43.281
This is right before dinner

13:43.323 --> 13:44.865
when my mom and I

13:43.323 --> 13:44.865
get in a huge fight,

13:44.907 --> 13:46.867
and I blow everything

13:44.907 --> 13:46.867
up! You're supposed

13:44.907 --> 13:46.867
to stop me!

13:46.909 --> 13:48.869
Tell me to breathe

13:46.909 --> 13:48.869
or something!

13:48.911 --> 13:50.913
God, did you ever think

13:48.911 --> 13:50.913
that maybe your mother is

13:50.955 --> 13:52.332
not the one

13:50.955 --> 13:52.332
with the problem?

13:52.373 --> 13:54.875
She is a wonderful

13:52.373 --> 13:54.875
human being.

13:54.917 --> 13:57.337
It is your father

13:54.917 --> 13:57.337
who has real issues

13:57.378 --> 13:58.588
with women in

13:57.378 --> 13:58.588
wheelchairs.

13:58.630 --> 13:59.964
What are you

13:58.630 --> 13:59.964
talking about?

14:00.006 --> 14:01.549
You're supposed to be

14:00.006 --> 14:01.549
my emotional Sacagawea.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.549
(beeps)

14:01.591 --> 14:03.259
Sacagawea's busy.

14:03.301 --> 14:05.886
(whirring)

14:11.934 --> 14:14.729
(singsongy) Oh, dinnertime!

14:14.771 --> 14:17.273
(silverware clinks, laughter,

14:14.771 --> 14:17.273
indistinct conversations)

14:17.315 --> 14:21.068
Well, I just took

14:17.315 --> 14:21.068
some ibuprofen-- wink--

14:21.110 --> 14:22.737
so I passed that

14:21.110 --> 14:22.737
little episode on my own,

14:22.779 --> 14:24.823
no thanks to you.

14:22.779 --> 14:24.823
Uh-huh. Look at Scott.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.784
He's sitting as far away

14:24.864 --> 14:27.784
from me as possible.

14:27.826 --> 14:29.577
You know, I've been

14:27.826 --> 14:29.577
thinking about it,

14:29.619 --> 14:31.996
and he didn't even

14:29.619 --> 14:31.996
call me once

14:32.038 --> 14:33.832
after my horseback

14:32.038 --> 14:33.832
riding accident.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.625
(whispers) You

14:33.873 --> 14:35.625
didn't have an accident.

14:35.667 --> 14:38.753
But he thinks I did,

14:35.667 --> 14:38.753
and he never sent me

14:35.667 --> 14:38.753
balloons

14:38.795 --> 14:39.962
or came to visit me

14:38.795 --> 14:39.962
in the hospital,

14:40.004 --> 14:41.005
(whispers) or anything.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.507
Are you drunk?

14:42.549 --> 14:44.175
I have a cup holder.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.301
(fork clinks glass)

14:45.343 --> 14:46.344
(singsongy) Ding, ding!

14:46.386 --> 14:47.846
(singsongy)

14:46.386 --> 14:47.846
Fork made the sound.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.848
You don't have to

14:47.887 --> 14:49.848
say it, too.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.932
Before we eat, I'd

14:49.889 --> 14:51.932
like to go around the

14:49.889 --> 14:51.932
table

14:51.974 --> 14:54.143
and say what we're

14:51.974 --> 14:54.143
thankful for.

14:54.185 --> 14:57.146
I'm thankful for all of

14:54.185 --> 14:57.146
us being here together...

14:57.188 --> 15:00.650
especially June,

14:57.188 --> 15:00.650
our newest addition.

15:00.692 --> 15:01.942
I'm thankful we were able

15:00.692 --> 15:01.942
to get the Syracuse game

15:01.984 --> 15:02.943
on the dish, right, Tom?

15:02.985 --> 15:03.944
(laughter)

15:03.986 --> 15:05.946
Ha! Hilarious!

15:05.988 --> 15:07.741
I'm thankful

15:05.988 --> 15:07.741
the snowy owl

15:07.782 --> 15:10.201
is no longer on the

15:07.782 --> 15:10.201
endangered species list.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.536
To our troops

15:10.243 --> 15:11.536
overseas.

15:11.578 --> 15:12.537
MAN: I'm thankful

15:11.578 --> 15:12.537
for chocolate.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.247
WOMAN:

15:12.579 --> 15:14.247
And the Mars rover.

15:14.288 --> 15:16.249
And yams!

15:14.288 --> 15:16.249
(laughter)

15:16.290 --> 15:18.959
How come

15:16.290 --> 15:18.959
no one said legs?

15:20.712 --> 15:22.213
Uh, you mean, like,

15:20.712 --> 15:22.213
turkey legs?

15:22.255 --> 15:23.214
No!

15:23.256 --> 15:26.551
I mean you all have

15:23.256 --> 15:26.551
working legs,

15:26.593 --> 15:29.220
and none of you

15:26.593 --> 15:29.220
give a damn about them!

15:29.262 --> 15:30.889
Yams?

15:30.930 --> 15:32.181
Legs!

15:30.930 --> 15:32.181
(silverware clatters)

15:32.223 --> 15:33.974
(clenches teeth)

15:32.223 --> 15:33.974
June, pull yourself together!

15:34.016 --> 15:36.436
(normal voice)

15:34.016 --> 15:36.436
Everybody, I am so sorry

15:36.477 --> 15:40.981
that June is trying

15:36.477 --> 15:40.981
to ruin our special

15:36.477 --> 15:40.981
Thanksgiving dinner.

15:41.023 --> 15:42.400
What are you

15:41.023 --> 15:42.400
talking about?

15:42.442 --> 15:45.194
You wouldn't even be here

15:42.442 --> 15:45.194
if it weren't for me.

15:45.236 --> 15:49.240
You'd be screwing that

15:45.236 --> 15:49.240
life-size cheddar cheese

15:45.236 --> 15:49.240
over there

15:49.282 --> 15:51.992
and arguing with

15:49.282 --> 15:51.992
your selfish father!

15:52.034 --> 15:53.994
I'm Sacagawea!

15:54.036 --> 15:55.288
I'm on a coin!

15:55.329 --> 15:56.748
I'm money, bitch!

15:59.083 --> 16:01.168
June's legs work!

16:01.210 --> 16:03.045
I walked in on her getting nuts

16:01.210 --> 16:03.045
from on top of the fridge,

16:03.087 --> 16:04.923
and I didn't want

16:03.087 --> 16:04.923
to say anything

16:04.964 --> 16:07.467
because I didn't want

16:04.964 --> 16:07.467
to ruin Thanksgiving.

16:07.508 --> 16:09.719
Uh, June, honey, ignore her.

16:07.508 --> 16:09.719
This isn't about you.

16:09.761 --> 16:12.012
Chloe's always had a complicated

16:09.761 --> 16:12.012
relationship with my chair.

16:12.054 --> 16:13.890
That's why I put a lock

16:12.054 --> 16:13.890
on your tampon holder.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.018
Wait. What are you doing?

16:16.100 --> 16:18.018
What are you doing?

16:18.060 --> 16:19.019
Stand up!

16:19.061 --> 16:20.855
KAREN:

16:19.061 --> 16:20.855
Don't. Don't.

16:20.897 --> 16:23.065
Stop it! Chloe!

16:20.897 --> 16:23.065
Stop it!

16:23.107 --> 16:24.818
(grunting)

16:23.107 --> 16:24.818
No!

16:24.859 --> 16:26.235
She's done this to me before.

16:24.859 --> 16:26.235
Set your brake. Set your brake!

16:26.277 --> 16:30.030
Aah!

16:26.277 --> 16:30.030
Ugh! Ow! Ow!

16:30.072 --> 16:31.699
Stop it!

16:30.072 --> 16:31.699
Get off of me!

16:31.741 --> 16:33.743
Get-- Oh, my--

16:33.785 --> 16:35.119
Oh!

16:33.785 --> 16:35.119
(thud)

16:35.161 --> 16:36.537
Chloe!

16:38.247 --> 16:39.833
Seriously, June?

16:39.874 --> 16:41.041
You are laying

16:39.874 --> 16:41.041
on the ground,

16:41.083 --> 16:44.545
pretending to be crippled

16:41.083 --> 16:44.545
on Thanksgiving?

16:52.971 --> 16:54.931
It's a miracle?

16:56.307 --> 16:58.726
You don't... need

16:56.307 --> 16:58.726
the chair?

16:58.768 --> 17:01.521
No. I am so sorry.

17:01.562 --> 17:03.105
I was just trying to help.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.649
The only reason

17:03.147 --> 17:04.649
I got in this chair

17:04.691 --> 17:07.067
was just so you'd forgive me

17:04.691 --> 17:07.067
for dry-humping your husband.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.235
(all gasp)

17:08.277 --> 17:11.113
You were the whore?

17:11.155 --> 17:12.490
Chloe said that you knew.

17:12.532 --> 17:15.368
Nope. No.

17:15.409 --> 17:20.080
So Scott wasn't avoiding me

17:15.409 --> 17:20.080
because I was in the chair.

17:20.122 --> 17:21.081
Scott was avoiding me

17:21.123 --> 17:22.917
because he was afraid

17:21.123 --> 17:22.917
I'd make a scene,

17:22.959 --> 17:24.084
like this one.

17:22.959 --> 17:24.084
(chuckles)

17:24.126 --> 17:25.753
Get out!

17:24.126 --> 17:25.753
JUNE: Of course.

17:30.132 --> 17:32.092
Go.

17:33.135 --> 17:34.387
(meows)

17:33.135 --> 17:34.387
(gasps)

17:34.428 --> 17:37.724
Oh, boy. Freckles wanted to get

17:34.428 --> 17:37.724
out of here worse than me.

17:37.765 --> 17:38.933
Is he an outdoor cat?

17:40.059 --> 17:42.102
No? All right then.

17:46.148 --> 17:48.108
(sighs)

17:48.150 --> 17:50.945
I'm sorry. I think

17:48.150 --> 17:50.945
you're wearing my jacket.

17:50.987 --> 17:52.947
I must have left it

17:50.987 --> 17:52.947
on the chair back there.

17:52.989 --> 17:54.824
No, I'm wearing

17:52.989 --> 17:54.824
my jacket.

17:54.866 --> 17:57.952
No, that's mine.

17:54.866 --> 17:57.952
I... paid $1,500 for it.

17:57.994 --> 18:01.205
You don't think I can

17:57.994 --> 18:01.205
afford a $1,500 jacket?

18:01.247 --> 18:02.999
Why, because

18:01.247 --> 18:02.999
I'm black?

18:03.041 --> 18:04.918
You're not

18:03.041 --> 18:04.918
black.

18:04.959 --> 18:06.126
I'm black.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.963
Says it's mine right here.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.963
I'm Wayne.

18:09.005 --> 18:11.549
You destroyed

18:09.005 --> 18:11.549
the festive lining?

18:12.759 --> 18:13.593
You animal!

18:13.634 --> 18:15.762
(both grunting)

18:18.222 --> 18:20.307
Sucks working

18:18.222 --> 18:20.307
holidays, huh?

18:20.349 --> 18:21.768
(grunting)

18:20.349 --> 18:21.768
Take it off!

18:21.809 --> 18:23.143
I mean...

18:23.185 --> 18:25.104
(grunting continues)

18:27.065 --> 18:28.190
(crickets chirping)

18:28.232 --> 18:30.818
(lowered voice)

18:28.232 --> 18:30.818
June, oh, my god.

18:30.860 --> 18:32.445
You were great!

18:32.486 --> 18:34.447
Yeah. Yeah.

18:32.486 --> 18:34.447
It was just so great.

18:34.488 --> 18:36.657
Everything about that

18:34.488 --> 18:36.657
was just great--

18:36.699 --> 18:39.660
So great that your mother

18:36.699 --> 18:39.660
has been glaring at me

18:39.702 --> 18:42.580
through that window

18:39.702 --> 18:42.580
for the last 20 minutes.

18:42.622 --> 18:45.165
Why did you tell me that

18:42.622 --> 18:45.165
she knew about Scott and me?

18:45.207 --> 18:47.668
So you would get

18:45.207 --> 18:47.668
in the chair.

18:47.710 --> 18:49.670
You had to believe

18:47.710 --> 18:49.670
that was the only way

18:49.712 --> 18:52.172
she could get past

18:49.712 --> 18:52.172
her anger and accept you.

18:52.214 --> 18:54.174
Then why did you throw

18:52.214 --> 18:54.174
me out of the chair?

18:54.216 --> 18:56.010
So then she would

18:54.216 --> 18:56.010
super hate you

18:56.052 --> 18:57.887
when she found out

18:56.052 --> 18:57.887
you could actually walk,

18:57.929 --> 18:59.973
and then they would give me

18:57.929 --> 18:59.973
cash to get away from you.

19:00.014 --> 19:01.223
They gave you money?

19:01.265 --> 19:03.225
$2,000.

19:03.267 --> 19:05.185
I knew they wouldn't want

19:03.267 --> 19:05.185
me living with someone

19:05.227 --> 19:06.270
who would lie about

19:05.227 --> 19:06.270
something like that.

19:06.312 --> 19:08.815
But the way that

19:06.312 --> 19:08.815
you bonded with my mom,

19:08.856 --> 19:11.233
and then outed your

19:08.856 --> 19:11.233
fling with my dad--

19:11.275 --> 19:12.860
nobody could have

19:11.275 --> 19:12.860
seen that coming.

19:12.902 --> 19:17.115
So this whole thing

19:12.902 --> 19:17.115
was a scam for money?

19:12.902 --> 19:17.115
(bills rustling)

19:17.156 --> 19:19.366
You used me to

19:17.156 --> 19:19.366
manipulate your parents,

19:19.408 --> 19:21.494
you made me lie

19:19.408 --> 19:21.494
to your poor mother

19:21.535 --> 19:22.870
about being

19:21.535 --> 19:22.870
in a wheelchair--

19:22.912 --> 19:25.247
$800, $900...

19:25.289 --> 19:26.916
$1,000. There.

19:26.958 --> 19:29.585
That should be enough to get you

19:26.958 --> 19:29.585
home to Indiana for Christmas.

19:29.627 --> 19:31.211
What?

19:31.253 --> 19:33.089
You seemed super sad

19:31.253 --> 19:33.089
this morning

19:33.213 --> 19:34.214
when you couldn't go home,

19:34.256 --> 19:35.842
and then you were yammering on

19:34.256 --> 19:35.842
about helping people,

19:35.883 --> 19:38.636
so I thought, "Why not

19:35.883 --> 19:38.636
use my screwed-up family

19:38.678 --> 19:40.220
to get you

19:38.678 --> 19:40.220
home to yours?"

19:40.262 --> 19:42.807
Chloe, that...

19:42.849 --> 19:44.433
(sighs)

19:42.849 --> 19:44.433
...that was-- that was

19:42.849 --> 19:44.433
really nice of you.

19:44.475 --> 19:46.978
It is nice.

19:44.475 --> 19:46.978
I'm really nice.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.731
June, why aren't you

19:48.729 --> 19:50.731
fanning yourself

19:48.729 --> 19:50.731
with your money?

19:50.773 --> 19:53.484
I'm really excited

19:50.773 --> 19:53.484
about going home for

19:50.773 --> 19:53.484
Christmas and all,

19:53.526 --> 19:56.278
but I mean, I kind of

19:53.526 --> 19:56.278
just feel really bad

19:56.320 --> 19:57.237
that I blew up

19:56.320 --> 19:57.237
Thanksgiving.

19:57.279 --> 19:58.865
Are you

19:57.279 --> 19:58.865
kidding me?

19:58.906 --> 20:01.241
That was the best Thanksgiving

19:58.906 --> 20:01.241
I've ever had with my family.

20:01.283 --> 20:03.243
Oh! Right.

20:01.283 --> 20:03.243
Seriously.

20:03.285 --> 20:04.286
After you

20:03.285 --> 20:04.286
left, we ate,

20:04.328 --> 20:06.539
my mom and dad bonded

20:04.328 --> 20:06.539
in their hatred of you,

20:06.580 --> 20:07.498
and then we

20:06.580 --> 20:07.498
played Charades.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.500
I guess I

20:07.540 --> 20:09.500
did kinda--

20:09.542 --> 20:10.835
Okay, now

20:09.542 --> 20:10.835
stop smiling,

20:10.877 --> 20:12.252
because I have to

20:10.877 --> 20:12.252
pretend to tell you

20:12.294 --> 20:13.504
that I'm moving out.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.050
Okay, this is me

20:15.715 --> 20:17.050
telling you.

20:17.091 --> 20:18.843
You're gonna take

20:17.091 --> 20:18.843
these leftovers,

20:18.885 --> 20:20.260
and you're gonna

20:18.885 --> 20:20.260
smash it on the ground,

20:20.302 --> 20:21.721
and then you're gonna walk

20:20.302 --> 20:21.721
to the end of the block,

20:21.762 --> 20:24.932
and I'm gonna come

20:21.762 --> 20:24.932
and get you in a cab.

20:24.974 --> 20:26.767
You wanna pick up

20:24.974 --> 20:26.767
some pie on the way home?

20:26.809 --> 20:28.268
I'm in the mood.

20:28.310 --> 20:29.770
I know you're probably

20:28.310 --> 20:29.770
thinking that you want pumpkin,

20:29.812 --> 20:31.313
but I'm gonna throw

20:29.812 --> 20:31.313
something out there--

20:31.355 --> 20:34.150
Dutch apple. Huh?

20:31.355 --> 20:34.150
You like that idea?

20:34.192 --> 20:35.317
(clatter)

20:34.192 --> 20:35.317
It's your call.

20:35.359 --> 20:38.278
We should talk like this

20:35.359 --> 20:38.278
to each other all the time,

20:38.320 --> 20:39.947
'cause this is

20:38.320 --> 20:39.947
really fun.

20:39.989 --> 20:41.908
(speaking inaudibly)

20:50.708 --> 20:52.292
Oh. Dutch apple.

20:50.708 --> 20:52.292
So good, right?

20:52.334 --> 20:55.046
So this is what guys

20:52.334 --> 20:55.046
make love to

20:55.171 --> 20:57.339
when they can't

20:55.171 --> 20:57.339
get girls?

20:59.383 --> 21:00.593
Hmm. I get it.

21:00.634 --> 21:01.594
(door opens)

21:01.635 --> 21:03.930
I had

21:01.635 --> 21:03.930
the most amazing day.

21:03.971 --> 21:05.681
Aw, isn't helping people

21:03.971 --> 21:05.681
the best?

21:03.971 --> 21:05.681
(door closes)

21:05.723 --> 21:07.307
I have reached bottom.

21:05.723 --> 21:07.307
Literally.

21:07.349 --> 21:09.393
A homeless man's bottom

21:07.349 --> 21:09.393
was on my face.

21:09.435 --> 21:10.728
They made me wait

21:09.435 --> 21:10.728
on the meat scale

21:10.770 --> 21:12.021
while the officer

21:10.770 --> 21:12.021
took my statement.

21:12.063 --> 21:14.356
I don't know

21:12.063 --> 21:14.356
if it was the stress,

21:14.398 --> 21:16.109
or the food,

21:14.398 --> 21:16.109
or the bum fight,

21:16.150 --> 21:17.317
but somehow, some way,

21:17.359 --> 21:19.737
I lost 2 pounds on

21:17.359 --> 21:19.737
the fattest day of the year.

21:20.738 --> 21:22.573
Do you know

21:20.738 --> 21:22.573
what that means?

21:22.615 --> 21:24.324
I negated the Christmas gain!

21:24.366 --> 21:25.826
I'm going

21:24.366 --> 21:25.826
into the holiday season

21:25.868 --> 21:27.828
two pounds underweight!

21:25.868 --> 21:27.828
Nice!

21:27.870 --> 21:31.624
Looking good, skinny!

21:27.870 --> 21:31.624
(sighs)

21:31.665 --> 21:36.003
I am caught in the shallow end

21:31.665 --> 21:36.003
of a very dark pool.

21:36.045 --> 21:37.337
Think that's a good idea.
