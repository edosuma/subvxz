WEBVTT

00:08.322 --> 00:10.755
Where do they
all go, anyway?

00:10.757 --> 00:12.031
Who?

00:12.033 --> 00:13.667
People that live in
these neighborhoods.

00:13.669 --> 00:15.573
Money moves in,
they move out.

00:15.575 --> 00:17.040
The poor get pushed out,

00:17.042 --> 00:18.377
but murder gets
to stay, huh?

00:18.379 --> 00:20.210
Sounds about right.

00:20.212 --> 00:22.218
What do we got?

00:22.220 --> 00:23.555
We got a male, white.

00:23.557 --> 00:25.220
Counted a dozen
stab wounds.

00:25.222 --> 00:26.125
I.D.?

00:26.127 --> 00:27.526
No wallet, no
cell phone,

00:27.528 --> 00:28.632
but I'm pretty sure

00:28.634 --> 00:30.067
that's Brent Madison.

00:30.069 --> 00:31.267
What? You're kidding.

00:31.269 --> 00:32.869
Nope, the wife and I got
into farm-to-table cooking

00:32.871 --> 00:34.072
'cause of him.

00:34.074 --> 00:36.409
Well, he was a chef
on a reality cooking show

00:36.411 --> 00:37.745
a couple
of seasons back.

00:37.747 --> 00:39.018
He won big.

00:39.020 --> 00:41.882
He opened up a place
in Tribeca, the LES.

00:41.884 --> 00:44.187
Yeah, that's him
all right.

00:44.189 --> 00:46.091
No cash register to rob,
no knife,

00:46.093 --> 00:47.427
no footprints in the blood.

00:47.429 --> 00:48.763
May be a hit.

00:48.765 --> 00:50.259
I may have a suspect for you.

00:50.261 --> 00:51.995
Last week, my partner
and I responded

00:51.997 --> 00:53.397
to a call here.

00:53.399 --> 00:56.101
Two males having a verbal altercation.
Huh.

00:56.103 --> 00:57.901
It was the victim
out on the sidewalk

00:57.903 --> 01:00.308
having a screaming match
with Marty Dustin.

01:00.310 --> 01:02.340
Well, it wouldn't be
the first time.

01:02.342 --> 01:05.748
Another celebrity chef
I should know?

01:05.750 --> 01:08.383
Brent was Marty's mentor
on the show.

01:08.385 --> 01:10.120
They almost strangled
each other on live TV

01:10.122 --> 01:11.425
during the season finale.

01:11.427 --> 01:13.626
And Brent was holding
a knife that night,

01:13.628 --> 01:15.563
although he said it was
'cause Marty threatened him.

01:15.565 --> 01:17.194
Hmm.

01:17.196 --> 01:19.634
And you were too starstruck
to give a damn.

01:19.636 --> 01:20.963
I guess you
could say that.

01:20.965 --> 01:22.836
Bet you Marty wasn't.

01:24.670 --> 01:26.805
(sighs)

01:29.344 --> 01:32.479
(siren wailing)

01:34.000 --> 01:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:46.603 --> 01:48.001
WOMAN:
No, and you hide me away

01:48.003 --> 01:49.737
like you're
embarrassed of me.

01:49.739 --> 01:51.401
(gasping)

01:51.403 --> 01:52.808
Ma'am, roll down the window?
Just hold on.

01:52.810 --> 01:55.138
If that's all I am to you,
then we're done!

01:55.140 --> 01:56.411
MAN: Honey...
Ma'am!

01:56.413 --> 01:57.380
Just...

01:57.382 --> 01:59.685
What?

01:59.687 --> 02:01.021
You been drinking
tonight?

02:01.023 --> 02:03.086
What makes you think that?

02:03.088 --> 02:05.021
I just saw you blow
through a red light.

02:05.023 --> 02:07.493
Fine, maybe I had
a glass of wine.

02:07.495 --> 02:09.526
Ma'am, please turn
off the ignition,

02:09.527 --> 02:10.798
step out of
the vehicle.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.833
(sighs) Officer, is this
really necessary?

02:12.835 --> 02:14.033
Sir, I'm not
talking to you.

02:14.035 --> 02:15.401
I understand,
but I could switch places

02:15.403 --> 02:16.738
and just drive
her home.

02:16.740 --> 02:17.770
That's not how this works.

02:17.772 --> 02:19.338
Ma'am, step out of the vehicle.

02:19.340 --> 02:21.779
Do you not know
who he is?

02:21.781 --> 02:23.347
Jess, Jess...

02:23.349 --> 02:26.219
He's the majority speaker
for the state senate.

02:26.221 --> 02:27.147
How nice for him.

02:27.149 --> 02:28.451
I said step out
of the vehicle.

02:28.453 --> 02:30.683
Do we have
to do this, son?

02:30.685 --> 02:32.419
OFFICER 2:
Sir?

02:33.262 --> 02:34.525
Get back in the car,

02:34.527 --> 02:36.165
or I'm taking you both in
right now.

02:36.167 --> 02:37.566
She's right.

02:37.568 --> 02:39.334
I am Senator
Ted McCreary.

02:39.336 --> 02:42.036
Then you should know
that driving while intoxicated

02:42.038 --> 02:43.603
is illegal
in this state, Senator.

02:43.605 --> 02:46.035
Just do me a favor--
look at this...

02:46.037 --> 02:48.308
Stop right there! Take your hand
out of your pocket now!

02:48.310 --> 02:51.141
There, just look
at this card.

02:51.143 --> 02:55.151
This has the cell phone number
of Commissioner Reagan.

02:56.017 --> 02:58.383
Just call him.

02:58.385 --> 03:01.159
Trust me, you want
to make this call.

03:05.624 --> 03:09.565
Wait, he got mad at you because
you arrested him at work?

03:09.567 --> 03:11.900
After he robbed his
coworker at gunpoint.

03:11.902 --> 03:14.331
Said I was making him look
bad in front of the boss.

03:14.333 --> 03:15.963
(laughs)

03:15.965 --> 03:18.338
See what happens
when we take a day off?

03:18.340 --> 03:19.665
Weird things happen.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.833
Speaking of.

03:21.835 --> 03:24.008
What are they
all looking at?

03:25.842 --> 03:28.343
Something on their phones.

03:30.448 --> 03:34.810
So people ignore each other,
like, in big groups now?

03:34.812 --> 03:36.242
(chuckles)

03:45.985 --> 03:48.183
(cell phones beeping)

03:59.232 --> 04:00.631
Hey!

04:02.073 --> 04:03.968
Hey!

04:03.970 --> 04:05.870
JANKO:
Hey, are you okay?

04:05.872 --> 04:07.237
Are you okay?

04:07.239 --> 04:08.237
What?

04:08.239 --> 04:10.172
Talk to me. What's your name?

04:10.174 --> 04:11.970
Were you with any
of these people?

04:11.972 --> 04:14.671
Jamie.

04:15.810 --> 04:17.112
Hey, how did
you get here?

04:17.113 --> 04:19.406
How'd you get here?
Talk to me, talk to me.

04:19.409 --> 04:21.446
12 George to central,
requesting a bus.

04:21.447 --> 04:23.477
Washington Square Park,
underneath the arch.

How are you?

Frank.
Hey.

05:02.751 --> 05:04.147
I'm sorry to be late.

05:04.149 --> 05:05.115
You're right on time.

05:05.117 --> 05:06.651
I always factor in
an extra 15 minutes

05:06.653 --> 05:08.451
when I know it's you.

05:08.453 --> 05:10.627
I thought you told me
that Benny retired.

05:10.629 --> 05:12.627
Well, he did,
I just made sure that he left

05:12.629 --> 05:15.397
strict instructions
about how we like the hash.

05:15.399 --> 05:17.669
Frank...

05:17.671 --> 05:20.364
I'm sorry about
last night.

05:21.637 --> 05:23.569
An apology isn't
what I was looking for.

05:23.571 --> 05:26.568
Well, the kid
wouldn't listen, I...

05:26.570 --> 05:31.272
That kid is a cop
who was doing his job.

05:31.274 --> 05:32.807
This isn't Albany,
Ted, you got lucky.

05:32.809 --> 05:34.446
I understand
completely.

05:34.448 --> 05:36.140
And I'm glad he
talked me down

05:36.142 --> 05:37.907
from waking you in the
middle of the night.

05:37.909 --> 05:38.946
What were you
thinking?

05:38.948 --> 05:40.074
I wasn't.

05:40.076 --> 05:41.513
(chuckles)

05:41.515 --> 05:43.514
I hadn't had a
drop to drink.

05:43.516 --> 05:45.617
I don't know why I didn't
insist on driving.

05:45.619 --> 05:46.585
Who is she?

05:46.587 --> 05:47.520
Jess Weinstein,

05:47.522 --> 05:49.551
my deputy chief
of staff.

05:49.553 --> 05:52.424
She masterminded
my last campaign,

05:52.426 --> 05:53.752
she's sharp as a tack.

05:53.754 --> 05:56.360
Until she becomes
as dumb as a box of rocks

05:56.362 --> 05:57.622
with one
of my officers.

05:57.624 --> 06:00.958
That is the only reason I
dropped your card, Frank.

06:00.960 --> 06:03.196
I just... I didn't
want a scene.

06:03.198 --> 06:06.099
And your officer, by the
way, was really kind.

06:06.101 --> 06:07.833
He let me drive
her home...

06:07.835 --> 06:10.368
And he dropped it
down to a DUI.

06:12.802 --> 06:14.671
She's still gonna have
to appear, though.

06:17.606 --> 06:19.635
Uh... that's a problem.

06:19.637 --> 06:20.634
One she created.

06:20.636 --> 06:22.801
It still has to go away.

06:22.803 --> 06:24.271
Why?

06:24.273 --> 06:27.375
Because she's the right hand
of the senate majority leader,

06:27.377 --> 06:30.111
who's campaigned
his entire career

06:30.113 --> 06:32.776
on stiffer penalties
for drunk drivers.

06:32.778 --> 06:34.878
The headlines will write
themselves, Frank.

06:34.880 --> 06:37.549
I can't squash this because
of some tawdry headline.

06:37.551 --> 06:38.885
A false headline,
Frank--

06:38.887 --> 06:41.255
there's nothing going
on between me and Jess.

06:44.196 --> 06:45.858
That hadn't
crossed my mind.

06:45.860 --> 06:47.762
Well, it shouldn't.

06:49.100 --> 06:51.065
But if the summons reaches
the paper,

06:51.067 --> 06:53.432
it'd place you in the car.
Yes.

06:53.434 --> 06:55.103
With a younger woman.
A colleague.

06:55.105 --> 06:56.437
Late.

06:56.439 --> 06:58.804
After a night of drinking.

07:00.237 --> 07:04.139
That is exactly the way
Laura is gonna look at it.

07:04.141 --> 07:05.771
And the tabloids.

07:05.773 --> 07:09.348
And the jackals across the aisle
from me in the State House.

07:09.350 --> 07:12.348
I'm pretty sure any wife
would look at it that way,

07:12.350 --> 07:15.451
especially if it's on the
front page of every paper.

07:16.622 --> 07:18.820
So, Frank, please?

07:21.789 --> 07:23.354
I'll look into it.

07:23.356 --> 07:25.625
Ah, thank you,
thank you.

07:30.128 --> 07:31.494
Hey, how is she?

07:31.496 --> 07:33.600
Not feeling too hot after
getting her stomach pumped,

07:33.602 --> 07:34.536
but she'll live.

07:34.538 --> 07:35.632
Anything else
you can tell us?

07:35.634 --> 07:37.301
Tox screen won't come back
for a couple days,

07:37.303 --> 07:39.330
but no signs
of sexual assault.

07:39.332 --> 07:40.833
Thanks, Doc.

07:45.442 --> 07:46.640
Hey.

07:47.738 --> 07:49.008
What's going on?

07:49.010 --> 07:50.776
Why don't we start
with your name?

07:50.778 --> 07:52.440
Oh, Christina Henley.

07:52.442 --> 07:53.777
How did I get here?

07:53.779 --> 07:56.049
We found you in Washington
Square Park last night.

07:56.051 --> 07:58.352
Were you
with those people?

07:58.354 --> 07:59.689
People?

07:59.691 --> 08:01.017
There was a crowd
on their phones.

08:01.019 --> 08:02.352
They were
doing something.

08:02.354 --> 08:03.624
Uh, Ionic Siege.

08:03.626 --> 08:06.824
It's this, um, augmented
reality game we play.

08:06.826 --> 08:08.896
“Augmented” means
taking drugs?

08:08.898 --> 08:12.566
It means playing in the real
world against other gamers,

08:12.568 --> 08:14.262
not alone in
your room.

08:14.264 --> 08:15.334
I don't do drugs.

08:15.336 --> 08:17.198
Okay, so someone dosed you?

08:18.400 --> 08:19.965
I was, um...

08:19.967 --> 08:22.301
out of breath
from running.

08:22.303 --> 08:23.709
Some guys gave
me a drink.

08:23.711 --> 08:26.677
A-a minute later,
I started to lose it.

08:26.679 --> 08:28.077
Did you know
these guys?

08:28.079 --> 08:30.673
No.

08:30.675 --> 08:32.807
Oh, but I bet Trevor
put 'em up to it.

08:32.808 --> 08:34.543
Who's Trevor?

08:34.544 --> 08:35.775
My ex.

08:36.745 --> 08:39.780
We met when Ionic Siege
launched last year.

08:39.783 --> 08:42.413
Couple weeks ago, I said
I wanted to switch sides,

08:42.414 --> 08:44.253
and Trevor got so
mad, he dumped me.

08:44.255 --> 08:47.322
A guy dumped you over a game?

08:47.324 --> 08:49.722
He acted like I cheated
on him or something.

08:49.724 --> 08:51.289
Sounds pretty controlling.

08:51.291 --> 08:52.593
Ugh.

08:52.595 --> 08:55.192
He started out so sweet.

08:55.194 --> 08:57.055
I thought he was different.

08:58.225 --> 09:00.094
Okay, so do you want
to file a complaint?

09:00.096 --> 09:01.726
No, I...

09:01.728 --> 09:03.398
I just want to go home, okay?

09:03.400 --> 09:04.501
Wh-Where's my purse?

09:04.503 --> 09:06.164
You didn't have a purse
when we found you.

09:06.166 --> 09:07.804
Wait, so my keys are gone?

09:07.806 --> 09:09.469
How am I supposed to get
into my apartment?

09:09.471 --> 09:12.037
If you have a super,
we can take you home,

09:12.039 --> 09:14.509
and they can let you in,
change the locks if you want.

09:14.511 --> 09:16.173
I should.
(stammers)

09:16.175 --> 09:19.110
Trevor never gave me
his key back.

09:28.527 --> 09:31.093
Sorry, we're closed.
Not for us.

09:31.095 --> 09:33.094
I'm not seeing Marty
Dustin anywhere.

09:33.096 --> 09:35.095
Anybody else thirsty?

09:35.897 --> 09:37.935
Looks like he's
celebrating.

09:37.937 --> 09:39.272
Marty.

09:39.274 --> 09:40.839
Oh.

09:40.841 --> 09:41.838
(sniffs)

09:41.840 --> 09:44.638
Why are you so happy,
Mr. Dustin?

09:44.640 --> 09:46.909
We killed again tonight.

09:46.911 --> 09:48.204
Did he actually
just say that?

09:48.206 --> 09:49.276
He just said that.

09:49.278 --> 09:50.876
What's going on?

09:50.878 --> 09:52.780
Well, someone killed last night, too.
(sniffs)

09:52.782 --> 09:54.811
Brent Madison, in fact.

09:54.813 --> 09:57.786
I didn't mean
“killed” like that.

09:57.788 --> 09:59.449
Well, since you threatened
him a few days ago,

09:59.451 --> 10:01.353
that makes you
our prime suspect.

10:01.355 --> 10:02.921
Hey, look.

10:02.923 --> 10:05.186
I loved Brent,
all right?

10:05.188 --> 10:08.933
We're about to drink an '82
Château Gironde in his memory.

10:08.935 --> 10:10.229
I watched your show.

10:10.231 --> 10:11.501
You hated him.

10:11.503 --> 10:12.997
Me and Brent,
we-we fought a lot,

10:12.999 --> 10:14.269
but he taught me
everything I know.

10:14.271 --> 10:15.437
I mean, I went over
there last week

10:15.439 --> 10:17.341
to help him with his new place.

10:17.343 --> 10:19.342
Or maybe you just thought
it was a nice location

10:19.344 --> 10:20.846
and wanted it
for yourself.

10:20.848 --> 10:22.574
(scoffs)
Believe me,

10:22.576 --> 10:25.814
I got my hands full
with this one.

10:25.816 --> 10:27.549
Speaking of hands,

10:27.551 --> 10:30.451
what happened to yours?

10:35.190 --> 10:37.787
My raw bar chef didn't
show up last night.

10:38.757 --> 10:40.323
I had to shuck
oysters myself.

10:40.325 --> 10:41.930
Oysters?

10:41.932 --> 10:43.258
They come from
the ocean,

10:43.260 --> 10:45.299
and you use a special
little knife.

10:45.301 --> 10:47.668
How about you knock it off
with the jokes, okay?

10:47.670 --> 10:49.004
You're not
on TV tonight.

10:49.006 --> 10:50.773
Actually, I am.

10:50.775 --> 10:53.805
Tonight, last night,
the night before.

10:53.807 --> 10:56.951
You see, we're all here
pretty much 24-7,

10:56.953 --> 10:59.047
and that got time
stamps and everything.

10:59.049 --> 11:00.015
(sighs)

11:00.017 --> 11:01.350
When you said you went over

11:01.352 --> 11:03.182
to help Brent last week,
what'd you mean?

11:04.552 --> 11:06.925
He was in over his head
with his business.

11:06.927 --> 11:08.893
He was way behind
on his payments,

11:08.895 --> 11:10.828
he missed his
soft opening,

11:10.830 --> 11:13.324
he ran out of
friends at the bank.

11:13.326 --> 11:16.667
He said the people
leasing him the space

11:16.669 --> 11:18.034
were really
pissed about it.

11:18.036 --> 11:19.434
These people have
a name?

11:19.436 --> 11:21.666
Choinski Management.

11:21.668 --> 11:24.737
They own, like,
half of Greenpoint.

11:34.004 --> 11:35.338
All done.

11:35.340 --> 11:36.538
Thank you.

11:37.709 --> 11:39.043
Here you go.

11:39.045 --> 11:40.074
Feel better?

11:40.076 --> 11:41.979
Safer, I guess.

11:41.981 --> 11:44.419
Any history of violence
between you and Trevor?

11:44.421 --> 11:45.386
Not toward me.

11:45.388 --> 11:47.082
I mean, he'd get mad
at Ionic Siege,

11:47.084 --> 11:49.553
but he'd get over it.

11:49.555 --> 11:51.185
Hmm.

11:51.187 --> 11:53.456
Any chance this isn't just
about you switching sides?

11:53.458 --> 11:55.224
Maybe.
(chuckles)

11:55.226 --> 11:57.791
This game can be all-consuming.

11:57.793 --> 12:00.862
Even when we weren't playing,
we kind of...

12:00.864 --> 12:02.326
lived in our own little world.

12:04.231 --> 12:07.236
We used to walk
across the Williamsburg Bridge

12:07.238 --> 12:09.268
all the time.

12:09.270 --> 12:12.141
Pretend to be different people.

12:13.280 --> 12:17.678
I know it sounds silly,
but it was fun.

12:17.680 --> 12:19.416
But that ended when
you betrayed him.

12:19.418 --> 12:20.648
Yeah.

12:20.650 --> 12:22.048
And then weird stuff
started happening.

12:22.050 --> 12:23.320
My-my credit cards got canceled,

12:23.322 --> 12:24.657
my bank account was frozen.

12:24.659 --> 12:27.225
(computer beeps)

12:28.060 --> 12:30.427
(computer beeps)

12:35.207 --> 12:36.943
JANKO:
“Slayr866”"

12:36.945 --> 12:37.945
“MickeyFinn88”"

12:37.946 --> 12:39.280
Do you know any
of these names?

12:39.282 --> 12:40.881
I've never seen them before.

12:40.883 --> 12:42.785
But they're probably
dummy accounts

12:42.787 --> 12:44.281
created
by Trevor's friends.

12:44.283 --> 12:45.651
This is entertaining for them.

12:45.653 --> 12:47.723
Like drugging you last night.
Yes.

12:47.725 --> 12:49.155
Only I can't prove
any of it.

12:49.157 --> 12:51.227
And now I feel like
I'm living in a game,

12:51.229 --> 12:52.626
only I don't know
what comes next.

12:52.628 --> 12:54.098
We know what
happens next.

12:54.100 --> 12:55.393
What?

12:55.395 --> 12:57.129
We go, we talk
to Trevor.

12:57.131 --> 12:58.465
In person.

12:58.467 --> 13:00.402
In real life.

13:02.604 --> 13:03.771
Okay.

13:10.244 --> 13:12.851
Yes, we leased that space
to Brent Madison.

13:12.853 --> 13:16.187
Yeah, well, he won't be opening
his restaurant any time soon.

13:16.189 --> 13:18.523
I know, I found
his body last night

13:18.525 --> 13:20.587
when I went to see him
about a bounced check.

13:20.589 --> 13:23.122
You were the anonymous
caller to 911?

13:23.124 --> 13:24.890
I didn't want to
get too involved.

13:24.892 --> 13:27.058
Hmm.
This firm is where I work.

13:27.060 --> 13:29.698
If a renter decides not
to rent for any reason--

13:29.700 --> 13:32.466
bad plumbing, rat
infestations...

13:32.468 --> 13:35.370
Somebody getting murdered
in one of your buildings.

13:35.372 --> 13:37.074
...we lose money.

13:37.076 --> 13:37.568
Right.

13:37.592 --> 13:40.283
So the less the company name is
part of the story, the better.

13:40.644 --> 13:41.874
Lech prefers
it that way.

13:41.876 --> 13:45.651
Milena tells me
I'm “old school.”

13:45.653 --> 13:47.619
I'm Lech Choinski.

13:47.621 --> 13:49.914
Detective Reagan,
Detective Baez.

13:49.916 --> 13:51.650
This is about
Mr. Madison, yes?

13:51.652 --> 13:52.921
Yeah.

13:52.923 --> 13:54.953
What a mess he make
of my property.

13:54.955 --> 13:56.890
Well, actually, someone
else made the mess.

13:56.892 --> 13:59.160
We're just trying to figure out
who that somebody else was.

13:59.162 --> 14:02.494
Could be many people--
he's very rude, that kid.

14:02.496 --> 14:04.157
I have buildings
all over.

14:04.159 --> 14:06.459
Worst business I
have in 30 years.

14:06.461 --> 14:08.099
But Milena tell me
to rent to him.

14:08.101 --> 14:09.931
Kid on TV show
or something.

14:09.933 --> 14:13.236
I've been pushing Lech
to join the 21st century.

14:13.238 --> 14:15.300
We hear he was behind
in his payments.

14:15.302 --> 14:17.476
Much behind--
half million.

14:17.478 --> 14:20.444
I tell him-- open up,
make money, you can pay.

14:20.446 --> 14:23.108
But no,
everything wrong.

14:23.110 --> 14:26.148
Not enough kitchen
space, wrong ovens.

14:26.150 --> 14:27.550
I try to keep
him happy...

14:27.552 --> 14:29.750
And he just kept getting himself
deeper in the hole.

14:29.752 --> 14:31.757
And all the time,
he's very rude.

14:31.759 --> 14:34.357
Like he own the place,
when in fact I do.

14:34.359 --> 14:37.105
Old school guy like you, people
should do business with honor.

14:37.129 --> 14:38.357
That's right.

14:38.358 --> 14:40.396
Although American kids,
they don't have any.

14:40.398 --> 14:41.460
Is that right?

14:41.462 --> 14:43.396
Huh.

14:43.398 --> 14:44.635
Sometimes Polish, too.

14:44.637 --> 14:46.835
DANNY: Huh.
What do you mean?

14:53.210 --> 14:55.905
There is boy,
Victor Bajek,

14:55.907 --> 14:57.409
used to work
in office.

14:57.411 --> 15:01.450
He's nice at first, but then
he start stealing from me.

15:01.452 --> 15:03.650
Also from my property.

15:05.421 --> 15:09.387
Milena tell me last night,
she see him near restaurant,

15:09.389 --> 15:11.060
where she
found Madison.

15:11.062 --> 15:12.532
Hmm.

15:12.534 --> 15:15.502
I hate to say,

15:15.504 --> 15:18.070
but I hate to hold
back from cops, too.

15:22.113 --> 15:24.080
Okay, thanks.

15:24.082 --> 15:25.745
No priors
on the Bajek kid.

15:25.747 --> 15:27.418
His father's doing
a jolt upstate

15:27.420 --> 15:29.420
on, uh, forged
passports, though.

15:29.422 --> 15:30.957
Well, this ain't that.

15:37.568 --> 15:38.933
Mrs. Bajek?

15:38.935 --> 15:40.029
Yes?

15:40.031 --> 15:41.197
Detective Reagan.

15:41.199 --> 15:42.765
This is Detective Baez.

15:42.767 --> 15:44.405
We need to speak
to Victor.

15:44.407 --> 15:46.069
Okay, but what's going on?

15:46.071 --> 15:47.837
Can you just get him
for us, please?

15:47.839 --> 15:51.276
Victor, come out here.

15:55.414 --> 15:57.483
Victor, we need to ask
you some questions.

15:57.485 --> 15:58.747
Like?

15:58.749 --> 16:01.051
Like do you recognize
this man?

16:01.053 --> 16:02.019
Yeah, of course.

16:02.021 --> 16:03.155
Brent Madison.

16:03.157 --> 16:04.250
Where do you
know him from?

16:04.252 --> 16:05.890
I killed him.

16:05.892 --> 16:07.922
MRS. BAJEK:
Victor?

16:07.924 --> 16:10.457
What have you got
yourself into?

16:11.698 --> 16:13.127
Hey!

16:13.626 --> 16:15.464
Whoa!

16:28.167 --> 16:31.115
Just how many times do I
have to say no to her?

16:31.117 --> 16:32.645
You had a drink
with Ms. Farrell.

16:32.647 --> 16:33.685
That opened a door.

16:33.687 --> 16:36.316
I bought her a drink
to smooth things over.

16:36.318 --> 16:39.755
No doors were opened except the
one on the way out of the bar.

16:39.757 --> 16:41.089
She has a nice piece
of real estate

16:41.091 --> 16:42.520
on Sunday mornings
at 11:00.

16:42.522 --> 16:44.422
So do I-- my
parish church.

16:44.424 --> 16:46.086
Couple million
New Yorkers watch her.

16:46.088 --> 16:48.084
And you haven't sat down
for a profile

16:48.086 --> 16:49.521
with anyone
in almost three years.

16:49.523 --> 16:50.953
Well, that should
tell you something.

16:50.955 --> 16:52.392
It's time.

16:52.394 --> 16:55.024
It's time when there is an
issue that needs airing.

16:55.026 --> 16:56.359
It is never
time for me

16:56.361 --> 16:59.095
to flap my gums and act
all commissioner-y.

16:59.097 --> 17:00.430
Lieutenant Gormley,
sir.

17:00.432 --> 17:01.766
Thank you, Baker.

17:01.768 --> 17:02.966
What do you got, Sid?

17:02.968 --> 17:03.934
Officer Landau stated

17:03.936 --> 17:05.903
that when he pulled over
Senator McCreary

17:05.905 --> 17:07.166
and Ms. Weinstein
last night,

17:07.169 --> 17:10.406
they were engaged
in a “heated argument.”

17:10.407 --> 17:12.237
And his unofficial statement?

17:12.239 --> 17:14.939
He overheard her accusing him
of being embarrassed

17:14.941 --> 17:16.272
about being seen with her.

17:16.275 --> 17:17.441
She threatened to end it.

17:17.443 --> 17:18.809
It was a lovers' spat.

17:22.241 --> 17:23.943
That was his takeaway?

17:23.944 --> 17:24.911
Yes, sir.

17:24.913 --> 17:26.079
GARRETT:
Go back.

17:26.080 --> 17:27.183
<i>Senator</i> McCreary?

17:27.185 --> 17:28.151
Yes.

17:28.153 --> 17:29.719
Is there an ask on the table?

17:29.721 --> 17:31.719
He'd rather not see
this get in the papers,

17:31.721 --> 17:34.192
but asking is not the
same thing as getting.

17:34.194 --> 17:35.656
Are you considering it?

17:37.330 --> 17:39.128
(sighs)

17:39.130 --> 17:40.999
That'll be all, gentlemen.

17:44.296 --> 17:46.501
(sighing)

17:49.605 --> 17:51.969
(door closes)

17:51.971 --> 17:55.538
(siren wailing in distance)

17:55.540 --> 17:58.475
16 years old makes you an adult
in the eyes of New York State,

17:58.477 --> 17:59.706
do you
understand that?

17:59.708 --> 18:01.609
Yeah, I know.

18:01.611 --> 18:03.209
Then you probably know
you could be convicted

18:03.211 --> 18:04.449
of second-degree
murder.

18:04.451 --> 18:06.384
You know the sentence
for that, too, tough guy?

18:06.386 --> 18:07.752
Guess I'll find out.

18:08.522 --> 18:10.088
I've got nothing to hide.

18:10.090 --> 18:11.289
Nobody's arguing that.

18:11.291 --> 18:12.617
What do you want?

18:12.619 --> 18:13.793
I killed him.

18:13.795 --> 18:15.491
Right, for these.

18:15.493 --> 18:18.132
And you remember
Brent Madison

18:18.134 --> 18:19.498
from your time
at Choinski?

18:19.500 --> 18:21.161
And from TV.

18:21.163 --> 18:22.697
I thought he was rich.

18:22.699 --> 18:25.137
So you broke into his
restaurant to rob him?

18:25.139 --> 18:26.872
The stupid guy didn't
lock the door.

18:26.874 --> 18:28.536
I was hoping
to hit the register,

18:28.538 --> 18:30.105
but the place is
barely set up.

18:30.107 --> 18:32.579
So I went looking
for something worth something,

18:32.581 --> 18:34.547
And all of a sudden,

18:34.549 --> 18:36.083
he came tearing out the back
with a knife.

18:36.085 --> 18:38.177
Mm-hmm, and he
came at you?

18:38.179 --> 18:40.618
Yeah, so I took it off him,

18:40.620 --> 18:43.982
but he still kept coming,
so I stabbed him.

18:43.984 --> 18:45.452
It was, like, self-defense.

18:45.454 --> 18:48.218
And then you took
his wallet and cell.

18:48.220 --> 18:49.820
So where's the knife?

18:49.822 --> 18:52.021
I threw it in the East River.

18:52.894 --> 18:55.194
DANNY:
For the record,

18:55.196 --> 18:58.456
he came at you with a knife,
you took the knife from him,

18:58.458 --> 19:00.559
he kept coming anyway,
and you stabbed him

19:00.561 --> 19:03.159
here, here and here.

19:03.161 --> 19:05.367
Yep.

19:09.569 --> 19:11.071
Great.

19:12.377 --> 19:14.342
Sit tight.

19:14.344 --> 19:16.174
(door slams)

19:16.176 --> 19:17.510
Did you see that?

19:17.512 --> 19:19.845
Yeah, he has no idea
where our Vic was stabbed.

19:19.847 --> 19:21.149
Kid couldn't
kill an ant.

19:21.151 --> 19:22.843
And who the hell
keeps the wallet?

19:22.845 --> 19:24.178
You keep the
cash, the cards.

19:24.180 --> 19:25.178
You chuck the wallet.

19:25.180 --> 19:26.777
Well, our guy
isn't our guy.

19:26.779 --> 19:28.712
We're gonna have to
drill down on Choinski.

19:31.217 --> 19:32.814
Trevor Reid.

19:32.816 --> 19:36.823
Hey, I wasn't in Washington
Square Park last night.

19:36.825 --> 19:39.023
(keyboard clacking)

19:40.663 --> 19:42.524
Do you mind telling us
where you were?

19:44.862 --> 19:46.428
Uh, Columbus Circle,

19:46.430 --> 19:48.594
Central Park,
Washington Heights.

19:48.596 --> 19:50.160
Playing Ionic Siege?

19:50.162 --> 19:52.094
I didn't think there was
a law against it.

19:52.096 --> 19:55.091
No, but there is a law against
having Christina Henley drugged

19:55.093 --> 19:57.633
and stripped down half-naked
in Washington Square Park.

19:57.635 --> 19:58.928
How can I help?

19:58.930 --> 20:00.262
Christina's being
harassed.

20:00.264 --> 20:01.932
She says it's you
and your friends.

20:03.765 --> 20:06.395
Okay, um...

20:06.397 --> 20:08.771
let me tell you
about Christina-- I...

20:08.773 --> 20:10.138
I like her,
you know,

20:10.140 --> 20:11.538
and I enjoyed
being with her

20:11.540 --> 20:15.842
while it lasted,
but she gets in her own way.

20:15.844 --> 20:19.873
And she always, always finds
someone else to blame.

20:19.875 --> 20:22.512
So she dosed herself,

20:22.514 --> 20:24.511
stripped down to her
underwear in the park,

20:24.513 --> 20:25.950
for what reason
exactly?

20:25.952 --> 20:26.949
Eddie.

20:26.951 --> 20:28.679
I just want to make sure
I got it right.

20:28.681 --> 20:30.078
I don't know what
happened to her.

20:30.080 --> 20:32.612
How'd you know about
Washington Square Park?

20:32.614 --> 20:33.748
What do you mean?

20:33.750 --> 20:35.677
We walk in, first words
out of your mouth were--

20:35.679 --> 20:37.717
“I wasn't in Washington
Square Park last night.”

20:37.719 --> 20:39.380
I heard.
How?

20:39.382 --> 20:42.387
Ionic Siege compiles
field reports.

20:42.389 --> 20:45.690
That's for participants,
results, log notations.

20:45.692 --> 20:47.690
Christina showed up
in a bunch of posts

20:47.692 --> 20:49.660
calling for her
to be exiled,

20:49.662 --> 20:51.365
'cause of
her behavior.

20:54.905 --> 20:57.607
So you deny you did
anything to Christina?

20:57.609 --> 20:59.103
Besides break up with her.

20:59.105 --> 21:01.080
Yes.

21:01.082 --> 21:02.846
And I hope she's okay.

21:02.848 --> 21:05.909
I-I mean, look, if I had any
idea who was messing with her,

21:05.911 --> 21:07.445
if someone is,

21:07.447 --> 21:09.645
I would tell you.

21:16.591 --> 21:19.491
Lying sack of crap.

21:19.493 --> 21:21.595
Wishing won't
make it so.

21:21.597 --> 21:23.195
You believe him?

21:23.197 --> 21:25.227
All we got's
her suspicions.

21:25.229 --> 21:27.434
Why would she make
something like this up?

21:27.436 --> 21:31.266
People do and say crazy things,
especially after a breakup.

21:31.268 --> 21:33.066
Come on, we see it all the time.
So you're siding

21:33.068 --> 21:35.571
with this guy?
No, I'm siding with reason.

21:35.573 --> 21:37.507
No, you're siding with

21:37.509 --> 21:39.043
“she's a crazy ex-girlfriend,”

21:39.045 --> 21:41.243
or “she was drunk,”
or “her skirt was too tight,”

21:41.245 --> 21:43.011
or “she was
asking for it.”

21:43.013 --> 21:44.315
You know that's not me.

21:44.317 --> 21:45.820
And besides, we don't
really know anything

21:45.822 --> 21:47.788
until we can establish something
besides “she said, he said.”

21:47.790 --> 21:50.620
Well, you know what,
I believe what she said.

21:51.790 --> 21:54.457
Uh, Eddie, look, I-I know
this might feel personal

21:54.459 --> 21:56.128
because of what
happened to you.

21:57.897 --> 22:01.560
No, Jamie, this is not
about what happened to me.

22:01.562 --> 22:03.831
This is about what
happened to Christina.

22:08.702 --> 22:10.035
(elevator bell dings)

22:10.037 --> 22:12.697
McCoy wanted Choinski
on racketeering

22:12.699 --> 22:14.670
and construction extortion
in Greenpoint,

22:14.672 --> 22:16.365
but he could never make the case.
Figures.

22:16.367 --> 22:17.867
And then
when McCoy resigned,

22:17.869 --> 22:19.403
it just went
on the back burner.

22:19.405 --> 22:20.299
Why?

22:20.301 --> 22:21.667
I got a
16-year-old kid

22:21.669 --> 22:23.371
who's eating a murder
charge for Choinski,

22:23.373 --> 22:25.074
who conveniently
pointed the kid out.

22:25.076 --> 22:26.473
Did the kid confess?

22:26.475 --> 22:28.544
Yeah, and he had the vic's
property in his possession.

22:28.546 --> 22:31.478
You know, Danny,
most cops like closing cases.

22:31.480 --> 22:33.444
Yeah, when they got
the right perp.

22:33.446 --> 22:35.708
This kid's old man
is locked up, too.

22:35.710 --> 22:38.412
Choinski probably promised
to take care of the family

22:38.414 --> 22:41.548
while the kid goes down,
figuring he'd do a short bid.

22:41.550 --> 22:42.716
Well, you're right about that.

22:42.718 --> 22:44.357
I don't know a judge
who's gonna throw the book

22:44.359 --> 22:45.725
at a 16-year-old
without a prior record.

22:45.727 --> 22:47.659
Why couldn't McCoy
make the case?

22:47.661 --> 22:50.393
McCoy flipped one
of Choinski's guys,

22:50.395 --> 22:52.322
uh, Lukas Gorski.

22:52.324 --> 22:53.660
But then he
got cold feet.

22:53.662 --> 22:56.867
Rather go to jail
than rat out his boss.

22:58.069 --> 22:59.498
He still in?

22:59.500 --> 23:01.169
No, he got out
last month.

23:01.171 --> 23:03.768
He's working at an auto repair
shop on McGuinness Boulevard.

23:03.770 --> 23:06.071
Great, I'll go see him.

23:06.073 --> 23:07.406
Be careful, Danny.

23:07.408 --> 23:08.573
I always am.

23:08.575 --> 23:09.773
I'm not kidding.

23:09.775 --> 23:11.876
Choinski's grip goes back
a couple generations.

23:11.878 --> 23:13.340
They have a real problem

23:13.342 --> 23:14.772
with people poking around
their neighborhood.

23:14.774 --> 23:17.274
I'll be careful.

23:17.276 --> 23:20.411
(sighs)

23:25.588 --> 23:27.122
Hey.

23:28.558 --> 23:30.830
If I had a Porsche,
I'd definitely service it here.

23:30.832 --> 23:33.263
And I'd bet they'd get you
a great price on parts.

23:33.265 --> 23:34.295
Tell me about it.

23:34.297 --> 23:35.198
Hey.

23:35.200 --> 23:37.797
Lukas Gorski.
Who wants to know?

23:37.799 --> 23:40.869
Proper response is: “How can
I help you, Detectives?”

23:40.871 --> 23:42.205
(groans)

23:42.207 --> 23:43.940
How can I help you, Detectives?

23:43.942 --> 23:45.907
Start by telling us
why a guy on parole is

23:45.909 --> 23:46.875
working in a chop shop.

23:46.877 --> 23:47.978
That's not
what this is.

23:47.980 --> 23:50.041
Suppose we get your
parole officer down here

23:50.043 --> 23:51.274
and ask his opinion?

23:51.276 --> 23:53.281
Uh, he's, he-he's been
down here.

23:53.283 --> 23:54.544
Really?

23:54.546 --> 23:57.185
So maybe we should get the
auto crime unit down here.

23:57.187 --> 23:59.050
They could check out
some VIN numbers,

23:59.052 --> 24:00.586
do some sniffing
around, how about that?

24:00.588 --> 24:02.257
What do you want?

24:03.291 --> 24:05.287
We want you to talk
to Lech Choinski.

24:05.289 --> 24:06.255
Wearing a wire.

24:06.257 --> 24:07.927
What?! No, I-I already told
the D.A.

24:07.929 --> 24:09.327
(scoffs)
No.

24:09.329 --> 24:11.431
Okay, well, then you can
just go back to the joint.

24:11.433 --> 24:12.527
I-I can't do that, either.

24:12.529 --> 24:14.663
Well, then you're gonna
talk to Choinski.

24:14.665 --> 24:16.199
(sighs)

24:19.937 --> 24:21.039
(groans)

24:21.041 --> 24:23.238
They never learn.

24:33.678 --> 24:36.215
(indistinct chatter)

24:36.217 --> 24:38.224
Okay, you walk up
to a bad situation.

24:38.226 --> 24:40.160
What are the words
you really don't want to hear?

24:40.162 --> 24:42.392
“Not likely to survive.”
Not a shooting.

24:42.394 --> 24:45.188
If someone involved turns and
says, “You owe me a favor”"

24:45.190 --> 24:46.355
Yeah, I can see that.

24:46.357 --> 24:48.058
“Your kid did it”"
(laughter)

24:48.060 --> 24:50.192
LINDA: Danny.
That would never happen to you guys.

24:50.194 --> 24:51.527
Well, never say never, but...

24:51.529 --> 24:53.629
What's your answer?
“He said, she said.”

24:53.631 --> 24:55.324
I'm with you on that.
Right?

24:55.326 --> 24:58.028
ERIN: They ought to teach
a course at law school,

24:58.030 --> 25:00.468
because trying to get to the
truth of situations like that

25:00.470 --> 25:03.035
is like trying
to deconstruct a milk shake.

25:03.037 --> 25:04.770
What'd you catch?

25:04.772 --> 25:07.800
Girl says, “He's stalking me,
harassing me.”

25:07.802 --> 25:09.903
Guy goes, “I dumped her,
and she's gone nuts.”

25:09.905 --> 25:12.007
Is there any hint here
of “she had it coming”?

25:12.009 --> 25:14.006
Implied.

25:14.008 --> 25:15.605
And how old are
we talking?

25:15.607 --> 25:16.676
Just out of college.

25:16.678 --> 25:18.771
Any record, history
of harassment?

25:18.773 --> 25:20.179
None that I could find.

25:20.181 --> 25:21.675
ERIN: You might want
to take a look

25:21.677 --> 25:23.346
at his college files.

25:23.348 --> 25:25.715
I know the FERPA laws are a
little difficult to get around,

25:25.717 --> 25:28.019
but you might find a
cooperative ear if you dig.

25:28.021 --> 25:30.050
Which'll just turn up more,
wait for it--

25:30.052 --> 25:31.250
“he said she said.”

25:31.252 --> 25:32.984
Yeah, but it might
turn something up,

25:32.986 --> 25:33.951
so you got to do it.

25:33.953 --> 25:36.054
HENRY: Mm-hmm.
Okay.

25:36.056 --> 25:38.326
'Cause, boys,

25:38.328 --> 25:40.189
if what she said doesn't count

25:40.191 --> 25:42.358
because it was a “she”
who said it,

25:42.360 --> 25:43.895
it has no place in police work.

25:43.897 --> 25:46.534
A good cop can also
be a gentleman,

25:46.536 --> 25:48.868
when the situation warrants.

25:48.870 --> 25:50.396
I taught you that.

25:51.901 --> 25:54.940
Good advice then,
good advice now.

26:03.187 --> 26:04.723
(knocking on door)

26:04.725 --> 26:06.324
JAMIE:
Eddie, can I come in?

26:08.599 --> 26:10.125
Yeah.

26:12.464 --> 26:13.797
Hey.

26:13.799 --> 26:16.235
Hey.

26:16.237 --> 26:18.737
Look, I'm thinking
maybe you were right.

26:20.201 --> 26:21.503
I did some digging
at his college.

26:21.505 --> 26:23.166
He went before
a disciplinary board twice

26:23.168 --> 26:26.133
for stalking and menacing
two different ex-girlfriends.

26:30.973 --> 26:32.308
What do you want to do?

26:32.310 --> 26:33.540
Christina has problems,

26:33.542 --> 26:35.211
doesn't mean she deserves
to be abandoned by us.

26:35.213 --> 26:37.545
I say we check on her,
make sure she's all right.

26:37.547 --> 26:39.744
Hmm.

26:48.257 --> 26:50.790
I'll take a dozen Wellfleets
to start,

26:50.792 --> 26:52.757
and a petite filet,
medium.

26:52.759 --> 26:55.091
Bone-in rib eye,
black and blue,

26:55.093 --> 26:57.659
side of spinach,
nothing to start.

26:57.661 --> 26:59.657
Thank you.

26:59.659 --> 27:04.190
Well, my friend,
where are we?

27:04.192 --> 27:07.291
You give me that look, I
want to vote for you twice.

27:07.293 --> 27:08.930
(chuckles)

27:08.932 --> 27:11.328
It's a gift.

27:14.431 --> 27:15.861
What?

27:15.863 --> 27:18.533
I looked into it,
like you asked.

27:18.535 --> 27:20.165
I didn't like
what I saw.

27:20.167 --> 27:22.172
Well, I didn't ask you
to like it.

27:22.174 --> 27:23.835
I asked you
to make it go away.

27:23.837 --> 27:25.474
It's just a summons
to appear...

27:25.476 --> 27:27.938
Only because I
asked my officer

27:27.940 --> 27:31.777
if he could find a way
to knock down the charge.

27:31.779 --> 27:34.241
And you lied to me
about Jess Weinstein.

27:34.243 --> 27:35.577
Not at all.

27:35.579 --> 27:37.784
I told you
she was important to me.

27:37.786 --> 27:40.047
Come on, Ted,
I'm a cop.

27:43.089 --> 27:46.087
Frank, things have been
over that way

27:46.089 --> 27:48.527
between Laura and me
for a long time.

27:48.529 --> 27:50.390
It's none of my business.

27:50.392 --> 27:53.126
Okay, exactly right.

27:53.128 --> 27:55.828
But my officer did get
the distinct impression

27:55.830 --> 27:58.299
he was in the middle
of a lovers' spat,

27:58.301 --> 28:00.363
and you did ask
him to call me.

28:00.365 --> 28:01.331
So?

28:01.333 --> 28:02.969
So, if he is told

28:02.971 --> 28:05.938
that even the summons
to appear went away,

28:05.940 --> 28:08.306
he puts two and
two together,

28:08.308 --> 28:12.043
and what adds up is
his PC got bought off.

28:12.045 --> 28:14.314
So? He's some cop.

28:15.380 --> 28:19.450
I don't look at any of
them as “some cop,” Ted.

28:22.956 --> 28:27.626
Hey, Frank,
you are PC

28:27.628 --> 28:30.624
in significant measure
because of me.

28:31.730 --> 28:34.356
And I'll always be
grateful for your support.

28:34.358 --> 28:37.529
Yeah, well, you don't know
all that I did to support you.

28:38.827 --> 28:40.329
How's that?

28:41.466 --> 28:44.832
Like the grand jury decision
not to indict in '86.

28:44.834 --> 28:47.167
Around an iffy
police shooting

28:47.169 --> 28:50.208
where a lot of people thought
you perjured yourself

28:50.210 --> 28:51.673
to protect your partner.

28:51.675 --> 28:54.314
I testified truthfully
under oath.

28:54.316 --> 28:57.346
And the mayor's committee
never even heard about it

28:57.348 --> 28:59.650
because of me.

28:59.652 --> 29:02.690
Well, it's still
floating around out there.

29:05.828 --> 29:07.690
I don't like being
threatened, Ted.

29:07.692 --> 29:12.360
The last thing your mayor
needs is headlines

29:12.362 --> 29:15.295
in this climate
of anti-police sentiment.

29:15.297 --> 29:17.431
Come on, I can just go
to the mayor myself.

29:17.433 --> 29:19.967
It's not gonna scan.

29:19.969 --> 29:21.639
There's people out there
that are ready

29:21.641 --> 29:23.503
to jump all over
this thing.

29:26.606 --> 29:30.611
Ted, when I pit the loyalty
of even one of my men

29:30.613 --> 29:35.043
against some inconvenience
for you in the news cycle,

29:35.045 --> 29:37.947
it's no contest.

29:37.949 --> 29:40.221
And that's not
gonna change.

29:50.604 --> 29:52.570
We just ordered.

29:52.572 --> 29:54.873
I gave up steak for Lent.

29:54.875 --> 29:57.904
I've been thinking about
that rib eye for two weeks.

29:57.906 --> 30:00.111
I'm not going anywhere.

30:04.477 --> 30:06.642
(chuckles)

30:07.812 --> 30:09.979
Ah, Frank.

30:19.923 --> 30:22.960
Christina, it's
Officers Reagan and Janko.

30:22.962 --> 30:24.257
Anything?

30:24.259 --> 30:25.593
It's ringing.

30:25.595 --> 30:27.026
Not hearing
a ring inside.

30:27.028 --> 30:29.644
And you won't-- Ms. Henley
left a few minutes ago.

30:29.669 --> 30:30.899
Alone?

30:30.899 --> 30:32.938
Yeah, but I think the
boyfriend's back in the picture.

30:32.940 --> 30:34.803
She was all dolled up.

30:35.909 --> 30:37.780
She wouldn't trust
him again, right?

30:37.782 --> 30:39.045
Until she did.

30:39.047 --> 30:41.412
(sighs) Where
would they meet?

30:41.414 --> 30:43.613
Somewhere
they were good.

30:45.119 --> 30:46.685
The Williamsburg Bridge.

30:49.494 --> 30:51.461
August of '86,

30:51.463 --> 30:54.125
my partner and I were
returning to the squad

30:54.127 --> 30:56.167
when a call came out
over the air.

30:56.169 --> 30:57.936
Woman who was screaming
for help.

30:57.938 --> 30:59.904
We were two
blocks away,

30:59.906 --> 31:02.608
so we lit it up
and responded.

31:02.610 --> 31:04.608
But when we arrived
at the scene,

31:04.610 --> 31:07.240
the perp had already smashed
the victim's face

31:07.242 --> 31:09.216
in the sidewalk,
grabbed her purse

31:09.218 --> 31:11.984
and was in the process
of stealing her watch

31:11.986 --> 31:13.384
from her wrist.

31:13.386 --> 31:15.783
We got out of the car,
grabbed the perp,

31:15.785 --> 31:17.181
'cause he was fleeing.

31:17.183 --> 31:19.789
What we did not know is

31:19.791 --> 31:23.125
two other perps were waiting
in a parked car.

31:23.127 --> 31:26.493
They jumped out,
shots were exchanged.

31:26.495 --> 31:27.893
Jerry hit one of them,

31:27.895 --> 31:30.597
who went DOA at the scene.

31:30.599 --> 31:32.132
The other perp got away.

31:32.134 --> 31:35.332
Unfortunately, the DOA's gun...

31:35.334 --> 31:37.972
was never recovered,

31:37.974 --> 31:40.876
making it
a questionable shooting.

31:40.878 --> 31:42.676
That's truth.

31:42.678 --> 31:44.612
That's what I testified to.

31:44.614 --> 31:48.044
And the grand jury ruled it
a justifiable homicide.

31:48.046 --> 31:48.980
(sighs)

31:48.982 --> 31:51.683
Some in the press
wrote otherwise.

31:51.685 --> 31:54.683
So, McCreary greased the wheels
for you to become PC

31:54.685 --> 31:56.788
by keeping this out of sight
of the mayor?

31:56.790 --> 31:58.525
Or at least he thinks so.

31:58.527 --> 32:01.062
And now he wants you
to return the favor vis-à-vis

32:01.064 --> 32:02.701
the girl in the car with him.
That's about it.

32:02.703 --> 32:04.700
If you were cleared,
then that's that.

32:04.702 --> 32:06.834
I...
No, those grand jury hearings

32:06.836 --> 32:08.402
were almost 30 years ago.

32:08.404 --> 32:09.834
If there was talk,
then three decades

32:09.836 --> 32:13.434
is plenty of time for the talk
to ripen into legend.

32:13.436 --> 32:16.443
When legend becomes fact,
print the legend.

32:16.445 --> 32:18.411
Look, my dad was PC back then.

32:18.413 --> 32:21.547
There's no way neither he nor I
would pull any strings.

32:21.549 --> 32:23.748
But somebody thinks
they're doing you a favor.

32:23.750 --> 32:25.284
They could pull strings
without either

32:25.286 --> 32:26.620
of you knowing anything
about it.

32:26.622 --> 32:28.254
Time to shake the trees.

32:28.256 --> 32:29.824
Meaning?

32:29.826 --> 32:31.032
When there's
a girlfriend you can see,

32:31.034 --> 32:32.728
there's a dozen others
you don't see.

32:32.730 --> 32:34.400
'Cause you don't know to look.

32:34.402 --> 32:37.103
Not my style.

32:37.105 --> 32:39.039
Corruption, then.
You don't spend 20 years

32:39.041 --> 32:41.937
in Albany by keeping
your nose clean.

32:43.211 --> 32:46.083
No.

32:46.085 --> 32:47.817
What do you mean “no”?

32:47.819 --> 32:48.848
You're just gonna hang fire?

32:48.850 --> 32:51.079
I have no idea
what I'm gonna do,

32:51.081 --> 32:53.685
which means neither of you
are going to do anything.

32:53.687 --> 32:55.780
All this for what--
a summons to appear?

32:55.782 --> 32:57.915
All of this
so Officer Eric Landau

32:57.917 --> 33:00.683
knows his commissioner
can't be bought.

33:02.788 --> 33:04.992
(sighs)

33:22.679 --> 33:23.710
Christina?

33:23.712 --> 33:25.518
Trevor.

33:25.520 --> 33:27.654
I came.
Yeah.

33:27.656 --> 33:30.192
Look, those cops
told me what happened.

33:30.194 --> 33:32.161
I just, I want you to know
I wasn't behind it.

33:32.163 --> 33:33.592
You were so mad.

33:33.594 --> 33:36.222
Yeah, I know,
and it was a big mistake.

33:36.224 --> 33:38.692
Just like breaking up with you.

33:38.694 --> 33:40.091
Really?

33:40.093 --> 33:42.258
Yeah, really.

33:45.265 --> 33:46.358
Let's take a walk.

33:46.360 --> 33:47.831
I-I don't know.

33:47.833 --> 33:49.767
Come on, babe.

33:49.769 --> 33:51.368
You can trust me.

33:51.370 --> 33:52.473
I-I don't want to.

33:52.475 --> 33:54.475
Please...
Christina.

33:54.477 --> 33:55.380
I don't want to go, okay?

33:55.382 --> 33:57.045
Come on.
Stop!

33:57.047 --> 33:58.813
(screaming)

33:58.815 --> 34:01.582
What a stubborn bitch!

34:01.584 --> 34:04.518
(gasping for air)

34:04.520 --> 34:06.158
Hey, Trevor!

34:06.160 --> 34:07.390
Let her go!
Trevor!

34:07.392 --> 34:08.261
Let her go!

34:08.263 --> 34:10.324
Trevor!
Trevor, let her go!

34:10.326 --> 34:12.525
(grunting)
Hey, hey! Let go!

34:12.527 --> 34:13.829
(shouting indistinctly)

34:13.831 --> 34:15.429
I got you.

34:15.431 --> 34:17.039
Stop it! I just wanted...

34:17.041 --> 34:18.368
Stop fighting.
Christina!

34:18.370 --> 34:20.440
Shut up.

34:20.443 --> 34:21.946
(crying)

34:21.947 --> 34:25.210
Just breathe. Okay.

34:36.380 --> 34:37.545
DANNY:
Just relax.

34:37.547 --> 34:38.819
Hey, listen, I'm just saying.

34:38.821 --> 34:41.650
Look, Choinski's gonna
find this on me.

34:41.652 --> 34:43.123
Just keep your jacket on.

34:43.125 --> 34:44.291
You'll be fine.

34:44.293 --> 34:45.723
You don't know him like I do.

34:45.725 --> 34:47.690
That's why I backed out
of working for the DA.

34:47.692 --> 34:49.722
'Cause Choinski's smart
and he'll know!

34:49.724 --> 34:53.297
He's not gonna get
squat from you, okay?

34:53.299 --> 34:55.562
Look, I'm just saying...
maybe tomorrow night.

34:55.563 --> 34:57.571
'Cause if I go in there
all nervous, he's gonna,

34:57.573 --> 34:59.501
he's gonna make me.
Look, he trusts you, right?

34:59.503 --> 35:01.143
You used to trap
out cars for him,

35:01.145 --> 35:03.647
and you went to jail
instead of ratting him out.

35:03.649 --> 35:05.679
So, you're gonna go in there
and you're gonna get him

35:05.681 --> 35:07.878
talking about killing Brent
Madison and then you will

35:07.880 --> 35:09.814
never have to worry
about him again.

35:09.816 --> 35:11.685
You hear me?
Yes.

35:11.687 --> 35:13.517
Okay. Deep breath, deep breath.

35:13.519 --> 35:16.525
All right, 15 minutes
is all it should take.

35:16.527 --> 35:18.092
15 minutes in there.

35:18.094 --> 35:19.924
Oh, my God.
Or 15 years

35:19.926 --> 35:22.228
back in prison.

35:22.230 --> 35:25.096
Pretty easy choice.

35:25.098 --> 35:27.095
Get to it.

35:27.097 --> 35:28.327
(sniffs)
All right.

35:28.329 --> 35:29.358
You're good. Go.

35:29.360 --> 35:30.892
I'm ready, I'm ready.
All right.

35:30.894 --> 35:33.130
(singsongy):
I'm ready!

35:42.966 --> 35:46.130
CHOINSKI:
So, there I was

35:46.132 --> 35:48.970
in Warsaw... Lukas?

35:48.972 --> 35:51.242
Lukas!

35:51.244 --> 35:52.641
Come over here!

35:52.643 --> 35:56.514
Mr. Choinski, Milena.

35:56.516 --> 35:57.609
(speaks Polish)

35:57.611 --> 35:58.912
I haven't seen you
since you free.

35:58.914 --> 36:00.512
Oh, you know.
Yeah.

36:00.514 --> 36:02.712
I'm trying to keep a low
profile till I'm off parole.

36:02.714 --> 36:05.016
Ah, yes, of course.
And when you're off,

36:05.018 --> 36:06.983
you come back
and you work for me.

36:06.985 --> 36:08.223
Really?
Yes, of course.

36:08.225 --> 36:09.487
You are a good boy!

36:09.489 --> 36:12.023
Lech is very loyal
to his friends.

36:12.025 --> 36:13.695
Sit, drink with us!

36:13.697 --> 36:16.126
Well, so far, so good.

36:16.128 --> 36:18.293
Okay.

36:18.295 --> 36:19.826
(Milena clears throat)

36:21.099 --> 36:22.392
<i>Na zdorovie!</i>

36:22.394 --> 36:23.695
<i>Na zdorovie!</i>

36:23.697 --> 36:25.127
Ha!

36:26.433 --> 36:28.165
(exhales)

36:29.861 --> 36:33.401
S-So what-what I've heard
about Victor Bajek...

36:33.403 --> 36:34.770
is true?

36:34.772 --> 36:36.833
Really? What'd you hear?

36:36.835 --> 36:39.799
LUKAS:
That he... got in some trouble.

36:39.801 --> 36:41.807
Yeah, but he's a good boy.

36:41.809 --> 36:44.975
He'll be out not too long,
and I take care of him.

36:46.409 --> 36:48.513
Lukas, why you sweat so much?

36:48.515 --> 36:49.618
Me?
Yeah.

36:49.620 --> 36:51.051
Take off jacket.

36:51.053 --> 36:52.986
R-Really, I'm fine, thanks.

36:52.988 --> 36:55.618
Come on.
Come on, keep going.

36:55.620 --> 36:57.154
Why, uh... wh...

36:57.156 --> 36:58.992
wh-why take care of Victor?

36:58.994 --> 37:00.527
I mean, he's a punk.

37:00.529 --> 37:02.926
Well, yes,
but he's <i> my</i> punk.

37:02.928 --> 37:05.800
You had him kill that chef?

37:05.802 --> 37:06.800
(sighs)

37:06.802 --> 37:08.799
Come on, get a name!

37:08.801 --> 37:10.567
Madison?

37:10.569 --> 37:13.035
You heard that?

37:13.037 --> 37:15.001
What's so funny?

37:15.003 --> 37:17.901
Only people believe that
are cops, man.

37:19.935 --> 37:21.605
(quiet chuckle)

37:21.607 --> 37:23.101
S-So he didn't?

37:23.103 --> 37:24.501
Of course not.

37:24.503 --> 37:26.069
Then who did?

37:26.071 --> 37:27.340
You're writing a book?

37:27.342 --> 37:28.444
(laughs): No.

37:28.446 --> 37:30.075
Then why so many questions?

37:31.613 --> 37:33.944
Stupid men.

37:33.946 --> 37:35.408
What's that, Milena?

37:35.410 --> 37:36.447
Oh.

37:36.449 --> 37:39.540
You think women
can only be secretaries?

37:41.549 --> 37:42.947
So foolish.

37:42.949 --> 37:44.850
<i>I</i> killed Madison.

37:44.852 --> 37:46.514
Got it.

37:46.516 --> 37:47.983
I'm more valuable than you.

37:47.985 --> 37:49.215
He wasn't gonna pay.

37:49.217 --> 37:51.183
Had to be done.
Milena, you...

37:53.224 --> 37:56.623
You think that Lech would choose
any of you idiots

37:56.625 --> 37:58.159
to do the job?

37:58.161 --> 38:01.559
Wait, I don't have
take this from her.

38:01.561 --> 38:03.830
(Lukas yelling)

38:03.832 --> 38:04.799
(grunts)

38:04.801 --> 38:07.471
What are you gonna say
to that, huh?

38:07.473 --> 38:09.102
(yells)

38:09.104 --> 38:11.365
He's wearing a wire!

38:11.367 --> 38:13.666
It's the wire! That's why
you've been sweating so much.

38:13.668 --> 38:18.136
CHOINSKI: You son of a bitch!
I'll kill you myself!

38:18.138 --> 38:20.536
DANNY: Drop the knife!
Hands over your head!

38:20.538 --> 38:22.575
Freeze!
DANNY: Drop it! Get back!

38:22.577 --> 38:24.375
(Milena shouting in Polish)

38:24.377 --> 38:26.478
Against the wall!

38:26.480 --> 38:27.582
Freeze! Don't move!

38:27.584 --> 38:29.078
(Milena continues shouting)

38:29.080 --> 38:30.479
Hands over your head!

38:30.481 --> 38:32.415
Get 'em out of here.

38:37.929 --> 38:39.391
(groans)

38:39.393 --> 38:40.663
You all right?

38:40.665 --> 38:42.031
Get him a bus.
Yeah.

38:42.033 --> 38:43.095
You okay?
Okay.

38:43.097 --> 38:44.767
(panting)

38:47.001 --> 38:48.335
(Lukas grunts)

38:50.505 --> 38:52.503
Good.

38:52.505 --> 38:54.504
Good work.

38:57.343 --> 39:00.643
What are you so antsy about?

39:00.645 --> 39:02.026
I'm not antsy.

39:02.051 --> 39:03.612
If anybody's on the
hook here, it's me.

39:03.612 --> 39:05.883
(chuckles): I'm not
as dumb as I look, Frank.

39:05.885 --> 39:07.651
You don't look dumb,
you look antsy.

39:07.653 --> 39:10.283
If somebody you worked for
rarely took your advice,

39:10.285 --> 39:13.218
and then suddenly...
took your advice whole hog,

39:13.220 --> 39:14.658
you'd be wondering, too.

39:14.660 --> 39:16.521
Wondering what?
What he was up to.

39:16.523 --> 39:18.257
Why would I be up to anything?

39:18.259 --> 39:20.227
You said it was a win-win:

39:20.229 --> 39:23.166
your problem goes away,
my problem goes away.

39:23.168 --> 39:25.104
They're ready.

39:28.411 --> 39:29.914
(Garrett sighs)

39:29.916 --> 39:32.250
She have everything?

39:32.252 --> 39:34.219
Everything we have.
You're equivocating.

39:34.221 --> 39:36.485
Everything that we know of.
And we're agreed

39:36.487 --> 39:38.590
on the terms?
Yes. The first question

39:38.592 --> 39:40.664
and full response
has to make the cut,

39:40.666 --> 39:42.801
or the entire interview
is off the record.

39:42.803 --> 39:45.170
(sighs):
Okay, then.

39:45.172 --> 39:47.369
I can't control how she'll
shape the narrative.

39:47.371 --> 39:48.770
That's the risk we're taking.

39:48.772 --> 39:49.977
<i>You're</i> taking.

39:49.979 --> 39:51.241
<i>We're</i> taking.

39:51.243 --> 39:54.209
I'm doing this
upon your advice and counsel.

39:56.451 --> 39:58.145
(sighs):
Garrett...

39:58.147 --> 40:03.583
look, I'm taking your advice
because it's damn good advice.

40:06.592 --> 40:08.686
Or not.

40:11.329 --> 40:14.000
Nice to see you.
Nice to see you, too.

40:14.002 --> 40:15.769
Thanks for coming.
Wouldn't have missed it.

40:15.771 --> 40:18.202
You ready for this?

40:18.204 --> 40:19.402
(clears throat)

40:19.404 --> 40:20.939
Well, I think that's what
I should be asking you.

40:20.941 --> 40:22.075
Then yes.

40:22.077 --> 40:23.380
MAN:
Sound.

40:23.382 --> 40:25.246
(clears throat softly)

40:26.049 --> 40:27.688
MAN 2: Rolling.
WOMAN: And five,

40:27.690 --> 40:30.923
four, three, two...

40:32.196 --> 40:33.858
Commissioner Reagan,
thank you so much

40:33.860 --> 40:35.529
for sitting down
with us today.

40:35.531 --> 40:37.129
My pleasure.

40:37.131 --> 40:39.232
So, as you may know,
rumors have surfaced

40:39.234 --> 40:42.463
that in 1986, when you were
a detective for NYPD,

40:42.465 --> 40:45.469
you and your partner were
involved in a fatal shooting

40:45.471 --> 40:47.834
that may have been
a tragic error...

40:47.836 --> 40:49.401
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

40:49.403 --> 40:50.801
Garrett, we're rolling.

40:50.803 --> 40:53.032
I got this.

40:53.034 --> 40:55.472
(Anne clears throat softly)

40:57.075 --> 41:00.210
...rumors that it may have been
a tragic error,

41:00.212 --> 41:03.217
that it may have been swept
under the rug...

41:03.219 --> 41:05.185
and that subsequent
internal reviews

41:05.187 --> 41:07.418
may have been tainted.

41:07.420 --> 41:10.388
Would you care to speak
to those rumors?

41:12.063 --> 41:14.094
Yes, I would, Anne.

41:14.096 --> 41:18.334
In August of 1986,
my partner and I were

41:18.336 --> 41:21.901
returning to our squad when
a call came over the air.

41:21.903 --> 41:24.909
It was a woman
screaming for help.

41:24.910 --> 41:27.448
We were two blocks
away, so we responded.

41:30.636 --> 41:37.136
