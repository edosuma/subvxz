00:00.600 --> 00:02.400
Are you OK there, sir?

00:04.600 --> 00:07.199
I... I'm just, er...

00:07.200 --> 00:08.719
Getting a feel for the place.

00:08.720 --> 00:10.848
The Nyamoya situation?

00:10.849 --> 00:13.861
Godwin Hall. I'm due in here...

00:13.862 --> 00:15.795
1430 hours, Thursday.

00:15.796 --> 00:17.680
Status conference.

00:18.433 --> 00:20.713
Defence there.

00:22.593 --> 00:24.792
Prosecution here.

00:24.793 --> 00:26.393
Interpreters.

00:29.180 --> 00:30.513
Press.

00:34.753 --> 00:37.592
And where you are?

00:37.593 --> 00:39.433
Public gallery.

00:41.406 --> 00:43.926
- Right in here with us?
- As they should be.

00:44.113 --> 00:45.632
But the glass is soundproof,

00:45.633 --> 00:48.593
so if the session goes in camera,
it just gets switched off.

00:50.540 --> 00:52.073
It's impressive, isn't it?

00:59.273 --> 01:01.632
It depends who wins.

01:01.633 --> 01:04.873
This programme contains some violent
scenes and some strong language.

03:18.913 --> 03:20.593
All rise.

03:30.873 --> 03:33.953
The International Criminal Court
is now in session.

03:34.466 --> 03:36.266
Please be seated.

03:43.019 --> 03:44.819
Good afternoon, everyone.

03:55.833 --> 03:57.313
Are you OK there, madam?

04:01.313 --> 04:03.913
It's OK. You come with me. It's OK.

04:11.153 --> 04:13.752
Because of this, I ask the parties
that they address the court

04:13.753 --> 04:16.172
in a concise and coherent manner,

04:16.173 --> 04:19.913
and that they refrain from
delving into unrelated matters.

04:40.913 --> 04:43.994
And it is in the light of this
efficiency that I wish to raise,

04:43.995 --> 04:45.912
at this earliest of opportunities,

04:45.913 --> 04:49.312
our intention to submit evidence
of an incident which took place

04:49.313 --> 04:53.232
outside of the timescale permitted
by the court's mandate.

04:53.233 --> 04:54.472
Madame President.

04:54.473 --> 04:58.792
Ms Ashby, you are aware that the
DRC signature to the Rome Statute

04:58.793 --> 05:03.792
in 2002 invalidates submission
of any incidents before this time?

05:03.793 --> 05:08.152
Thank you, Madame President. We are,
of course, aware of this limitation

05:08.153 --> 05:11.392
and we do not seek to include the
submission within the indictment.

05:11.393 --> 05:15.312
However, we feel it is vitally
important for us to establish

05:15.313 --> 05:18.392
a pattern of persistent
conduct by the accused

05:18.393 --> 05:21.232
which in and of itself,
we believe presents

05:21.233 --> 05:25.912
a significant contribution to the
specific articles of the indictment

05:25.913 --> 05:27.793
for which the accused is standing trial.

05:28.280 --> 05:32.320
Our intent is to reveal
a course of prior conduct

05:32.321 --> 05:37.112
to establish a predisposition
of character, Madame President.

05:37.113 --> 05:38.272
Thank you, Ms Ashby.

05:38.273 --> 05:40.775
And thank you for bringing this
to my attention so promptly

05:40.776 --> 05:44.095
as it relates to Article 613b
of the Rome Statute.

05:45.189 --> 05:48.432
May I be clear the incident to which
you wish to refer does not appear

05:48.433 --> 05:51.392
in any documentation presently
available to the court?

05:51.393 --> 05:53.312
- That is correct, Madame President.
- Sh!

05:53.313 --> 05:56.272
This incident took place outside
of the court's mandate

05:56.273 --> 05:59.112
and has therefore not been included
in any warrants of arrest.

05:59.113 --> 06:01.832
We're only intent on
its inclusion at this time

06:01.833 --> 06:03.833
for the aforementioned reasons.

06:05.833 --> 06:07.313
Mr Zand?

06:08.540 --> 06:10.152
Thank you, Madame President.

06:10.153 --> 06:13.952
I hesitate to strike out of hand
any submission which may, in fact,

06:13.953 --> 06:15.993
prove to be of benefit to my client,

06:16.500 --> 06:18.516
therefore, we simply cannot respond

06:18.517 --> 06:21.952
until we've been made fully
aware of the submission.

06:21.953 --> 06:25.272
Ms Ashby, when may the details of
your proposed submission

06:25.273 --> 06:27.072
be made available to the court?

06:27.073 --> 06:29.152
Madame President, we have the submission.

06:29.153 --> 06:31.952
And we're ready to make
copies of the recording,

06:31.953 --> 06:33.513
at Your Honour's request.

06:33.940 --> 06:35.473
Thank you, Ms Ashby.

06:35.772 --> 06:37.212
One moment, please.

07:03.673 --> 07:07.032
Please make copies of your
submissions available to the court.

07:07.033 --> 07:11.713
And I am now closing the hearing for
me to consider the matter further.

07:13.426 --> 07:14.866
All rise.

07:35.633 --> 07:37.233
What incident?

07:43.113 --> 07:45.615
The one he thought we'd all forget.

07:56.683 --> 07:57.742
_

07:57.743 --> 07:58.855
_

07:58.856 --> 08:00.215
_

08:00.216 --> 08:01.722
_

08:01.723 --> 08:03.723
_

08:04.175 --> 08:05.771
_

08:05.772 --> 08:07.772
_

08:51.913 --> 08:53.553
It doesn't matter what you say.

08:54.753 --> 08:56.473
They already know.

08:57.060 --> 08:59.432
My daughter doesn't, and she deserves...

09:02.753 --> 09:05.593
Guard!

09:09.473 --> 09:11.193
No, no, no!

11:19.393 --> 11:20.713
What?

11:30.873 --> 11:32.833
We leave the wedding ring on.

11:36.626 --> 11:38.266
No, she wasn't married.

11:40.713 --> 11:45.513
It was, um... It was like an engagement.

11:45.819 --> 11:47.579
Has he been informed?

11:49.906 --> 11:51.426
He's dead.

11:53.879 --> 11:55.519
A long time ago.

12:33.993 --> 12:35.473
It's foul.

12:37.193 --> 12:43.020
But the shock of it
might, you know... help.

12:54.512 --> 12:56.472
We argued.

13:00.233 --> 13:01.633
Before she left.

13:06.713 --> 13:08.553
I left her a message.

13:13.113 --> 13:14.940
She, she didn't...

13:15.480 --> 13:16.760
It doesn't matter.

13:18.593 --> 13:20.353
She already knew.

13:25.713 --> 13:27.992
The presence of the killer's motorcycle

13:27.993 --> 13:29.592
abandoned at this second crime scene

13:29.593 --> 13:32.857
appears to bear all the hallmarks
of a classic clean-up job.

13:32.858 --> 13:35.392
Of the three men found
shot dead in the vehicle,

13:35.393 --> 13:38.784
two had apparently left
the ICC only minutes before.

13:38.785 --> 13:41.032
There is speculation that,
for whatever reason,

13:41.033 --> 13:44.432
these men had aborted an
initial assassination attempt,

13:44.433 --> 13:47.672
leaving a fourth member of the cell
disguised as a highway patrolman

13:47.673 --> 13:50.712
to execute a
terrifyingly-successful plan B.

13:50.713 --> 13:53.992
At this time, the identity of
these three men and their killer

13:53.993 --> 13:55.592
remains a complete mystery.

13:55.593 --> 13:57.632
Initial suspicions of a revenge attack

13:57.633 --> 13:59.472
carried out against Simon Nyamoya

13:59.473 --> 14:01.032
by Hutu extremist factions,

14:01.033 --> 14:03.552
with whom he had fought a decade-long war

14:03.553 --> 14:07.272
in the Congolese forest
have yet to be confirmed or denied.

14:07.273 --> 14:09.403
Back at home, the United
States President...

14:09.428 --> 14:11.873
Yes.

14:11.898 --> 14:13.792
I have a General Munezero,
Rwandan Government.

14:13.793 --> 14:15.460
Put her through.

14:16.073 --> 14:17.961
- Eunice?
- Alice.

14:17.962 --> 14:19.521
Are you going to the funeral?

14:19.522 --> 14:20.832
Yes, I will be.

14:20.833 --> 14:22.472
Then we should meet there.

14:22.473 --> 14:24.353
Yes, we should.

14:31.113 --> 14:32.352
General Munezero.

14:32.353 --> 14:35.192
I am a civilian now.
Member of Parliament.

14:35.193 --> 14:38.392
Of course. My name's Charlie
Barratt, I work with the FCO.

14:38.393 --> 14:40.992
- Welcome to the UK.
- Thank you.

14:40.993 --> 14:43.032
I'm here to speed you
through Immigration.

14:43.033 --> 14:44.872
Will it take long?

14:44.873 --> 14:47.640
Feet won't touch the ground. Please.

15:04.913 --> 15:07.912
What if they switched it all off?

15:07.913 --> 15:09.472
Nothing.

15:09.473 --> 15:10.953
She's breathing for herself.

15:11.500 --> 15:14.340
This is just to monitor.

15:15.272 --> 15:16.833
Mikey.

15:17.432 --> 15:18.952
It's fine.

15:19.313 --> 15:20.873
It's what it is.

15:24.632 --> 15:26.272
Do you think Eve was targeted?

15:26.660 --> 15:29.352
Why? Who knew?

15:29.353 --> 15:32.072
- She hadn't said anything yet.
- She didn't have a chance.

15:32.073 --> 15:35.073
They were aiming for Nyamoya. Had to be.

15:40.953 --> 15:45.352
So... is it all set up?

15:45.353 --> 15:48.632
Yeah. Just got to make a call.

15:48.633 --> 15:51.260
- Good.
- Just not sure that I should.

15:52.513 --> 15:54.112
Why?

15:54.113 --> 15:58.753
Well, the way Eve was going to do
it, it felt clean.

15:59.012 --> 16:02.812
- This way...
- Is the only one we have left.

16:06.913 --> 16:08.793
Are you sure you want to do this?

16:09.325 --> 16:11.605
Put yourself in the crosshairs?

16:14.193 --> 16:15.833
Mikey.

16:16.913 --> 16:18.713
They are already on me.

16:25.553 --> 16:27.233
Hi, fellas.

16:28.506 --> 16:30.180
Something up?

16:31.873 --> 16:34.832
I'm so sorry. It's because of my job.

16:34.833 --> 16:37.112
Alice is with the Rwandan Government.

16:37.113 --> 16:38.552
She's here for the funeral.

16:38.553 --> 16:41.033
Right. And, er...

16:42.513 --> 16:44.712
We go way back. What is it?

16:44.713 --> 16:49.352
Er... I came here for officer
training. When was that?

16:49.353 --> 16:50.793
Must be late '80s.

16:51.993 --> 16:54.204
Over 30 years ago.

16:54.205 --> 16:55.564
My God, don't.

16:55.565 --> 16:57.432
And I gave you a lecture on...?

16:57.433 --> 16:59.552
Geneva Convention.

16:59.553 --> 17:01.272
You certainly took it to heart.

17:01.273 --> 17:03.987
Single most important rule
book in the theatre of war.

17:03.988 --> 17:07.433
If only they could keep it to
90 minutes with a drinks interval.

17:08.792 --> 17:11.432
Her lot brought the
Rwandan genocide to an end.

17:11.433 --> 17:13.792
Well, OK.

17:14.713 --> 17:16.953
I'm a book illustrator.

17:17.459 --> 17:19.618
And Jenny's...?

17:21.193 --> 17:25.073
Well, companion, I guess,
is what you'd say at our age.

17:26.806 --> 17:28.966
Companion.

17:29.643 --> 17:33.192
Please, tell her I said hello.

17:33.193 --> 17:35.233
Yeah, sure.

17:35.740 --> 17:39.752
I remember her as a very beautiful woman.

17:39.753 --> 17:41.753
Yeah? She still is.

17:43.073 --> 17:44.953
Like her daughter.

17:47.739 --> 17:52.300
So... I will see you at the funeral.

17:56.153 --> 17:57.873
They're both gone now, Mikey.

17:58.700 --> 17:59.993
We carry on.

18:00.593 --> 18:02.033
We must.

18:02.973 --> 18:04.213
For them.

18:07.552 --> 18:09.032
So nice to meet you.

18:17.353 --> 18:19.512
Maybe not say hello from her.

18:19.513 --> 18:20.992
I figured.

18:20.993 --> 18:22.552
Are you still...?

18:22.553 --> 18:25.273
No, no, no, no. Long time ago.

18:26.753 --> 18:29.192
Thanks so much for doing this.

18:29.193 --> 18:31.873
It's just until Jenny
can do it for herself.

18:32.300 --> 18:33.832
Wasn't her fault.

18:33.833 --> 18:36.912
It's always a mother's fault, Michael.

18:36.913 --> 18:38.353
Always.

18:49.573 --> 18:52.740
Eve always insisted she was my mother.

18:54.019 --> 18:55.419
But she wasn't.

18:56.700 --> 18:59.473
She was the woman who rescued me.

18:59.860 --> 19:02.312
And actually,
she didn't do that bit either.

19:02.313 --> 19:03.592
Not the actual rescuing.

19:03.593 --> 19:06.473
That was done by a man named Ed Holt.

19:07.220 --> 19:08.993
Some of you here will remember him.

19:09.420 --> 19:10.712
I don't.

19:10.713 --> 19:13.513
I don't remember any of it.
Just what I'm told.

19:14.593 --> 19:17.553
But that's OK
because Eve told me everything.

19:18.180 --> 19:21.152
Ed was her partner, fiance,

19:21.153 --> 19:24.192
and they were both working in Rwanda

19:24.193 --> 19:26.113
just after the genocide.

19:26.540 --> 19:28.792
She was doing groundwork
for the tribunals

19:28.793 --> 19:31.353
and he was on an aid assessment.

19:32.479 --> 19:34.999
And one day, he found me.

19:36.266 --> 19:37.746
In an orphanage.

19:38.553 --> 19:40.712
Wounds that were killing me.

19:40.713 --> 19:44.780
I don't know why he chose me...

19:46.159 --> 19:47.759
just that he did.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.833
And a week later, he was dead.

19:53.172 --> 19:55.932
Killed in a plane crash
delivering aid to the DRC.

19:59.113 --> 20:02.432
Eve always said that I was
the last thing he gave her.

20:02.433 --> 20:05.716
And that's why she
treasured me ever since.

20:05.717 --> 20:09.873
Which can't have been easy
because I was completely bust.

20:11.513 --> 20:13.456
Not just here, but here,

20:13.457 --> 20:17.073
and I was... I was
never going to get fixed.

20:18.459 --> 20:19.859
But...

20:21.806 --> 20:23.846
that I'm standing here today...

20:25.373 --> 20:29.253
looking anything like a human,
it's because of her.

20:32.599 --> 20:34.359
Eve Ashby.

20:35.693 --> 20:38.380
And she wasn't my mother.

20:45.899 --> 20:48.539
I'm not even sure what that means,
or why I've said it.

21:03.500 --> 21:05.125
Is she reliable?

21:05.126 --> 21:07.593
That speech.

21:08.020 --> 21:09.753
It's a bit weird.

21:10.140 --> 21:12.353
For being honest?

21:12.780 --> 21:13.992
Inappropriate.

21:13.993 --> 21:16.033
She will be with Michael.

21:16.720 --> 21:18.092
What about him?

21:19.993 --> 21:21.313
When it gets messy?

21:22.300 --> 21:24.193
It will not.

21:24.472 --> 21:25.952
It already has.

21:26.953 --> 21:30.472
For all that easy charm, he wears
his principles like a Kevlar vest.

21:30.473 --> 21:32.633
He knows what has to be done.

21:33.620 --> 21:36.353
Going to have his conscience
shot to shit, if not.

21:38.273 --> 21:40.195
We are doing the right thing.

21:40.196 --> 21:42.753
May come a time when that gets forgotten.

21:44.153 --> 21:46.753
- We must make sure to remind him.
- So?

21:48.940 --> 21:52.712
We don't know, and we're not
going to. At least not yet.

21:52.713 --> 21:54.432
They've got nothing on the killer

21:54.433 --> 21:57.592
and the best they've got on the
other three is hair-strand DNA

21:57.593 --> 21:59.473
suggesting a sub-Saharan diet.

21:59.780 --> 22:04.313
Down there, Nyamoya has more enemies
than I have uterine fibroids.

22:06.740 --> 22:09.592
Just had an ultrasound,
I'm kind of obsessing about it.

22:09.593 --> 22:12.712
But we will find out, eventually.

22:12.713 --> 22:14.552
Just not the way we expect.

22:14.553 --> 22:17.312
It's Africa, is what it is, Mikey,
but then we all knew that.

22:17.313 --> 22:20.712
- That is why we have to do this.
- She's right.

22:20.713 --> 22:23.752
The only chance we've got now
of completing what Eve started...

22:23.753 --> 22:26.192
Is for you to make the call.

22:26.193 --> 22:28.353
- Do it for her.
- For Eve.

22:28.660 --> 22:30.873
And we might even find out who did this.

22:32.500 --> 22:33.913
OK.

22:40.553 --> 22:41.713
Here.

22:46.300 --> 22:48.153
Long time since I've seen this.

22:54.273 --> 22:55.992
She'd just changed the batteries.

22:55.993 --> 22:57.512
She intended to play it in court.

22:57.513 --> 22:59.393
She make copies?

23:00.606 --> 23:02.340
She didn't get that far.

23:03.593 --> 23:04.873
I've got one on my hard drive.

23:05.220 --> 23:06.632
That's very modern of you.

23:06.633 --> 23:09.113
Don't ask me to open it.

23:10.780 --> 23:12.553
Whole story's in your hands.

23:15.713 --> 23:18.352
Hell, I forgot.
I've got to give her something.

23:18.353 --> 23:21.140
So, when will it happen?

23:22.553 --> 23:24.833
But it will. Just carry on as normal.

23:25.500 --> 23:27.033
Look after me, Mikey.

23:27.753 --> 23:29.086
You'll be fine.

23:35.593 --> 23:37.752
What?

23:37.753 --> 23:39.140
That's what I told Eve.

23:48.233 --> 23:50.112
Serve it.

23:50.113 --> 23:53.432
I'm going the wrong way.

23:53.433 --> 23:55.473
Excuse me, I have to catch a plane.

23:57.900 --> 24:00.273
I have something for you.

24:03.379 --> 24:08.108
This, it is of your mother.
Er... I mean Eve.

24:08.137 --> 24:10.472
No, she was my mother.

24:10.473 --> 24:12.220
What I meant to say was,

24:12.793 --> 24:16.460
in a way she was... she was more.

24:17.313 --> 24:19.033
I don't know what I meant to say.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.233
Look at it.

24:24.100 --> 24:29.832
Actually, there is also me and Michael.

24:29.833 --> 24:33.872
And that there, that is Ed.

24:33.873 --> 24:35.153
See?

24:38.819 --> 24:40.579
When was it taken?

24:41.606 --> 24:43.806
Just before he died.

24:48.037 --> 24:49.409
And where was it taken?

24:49.410 --> 24:50.873
Kigali.

24:53.980 --> 24:55.592
That's wonderful.

24:55.593 --> 24:59.512
No, no, keep it. I brought it for you.

24:59.513 --> 25:01.832
And there is something else.

25:01.833 --> 25:04.793
But that is for another day.

25:07.085 --> 25:09.485
Whatever happens now...

25:12.053 --> 25:13.940
remember that.

25:16.233 --> 25:18.313
Why? What's going to happen?

25:20.913 --> 25:22.713
And stay close to Michael.

25:23.286 --> 25:25.086
What's going to happen?

26:12.553 --> 26:13.993
Alice Munezero?

26:16.033 --> 26:17.593
- Yes.
- You're under arrest.

26:19.420 --> 26:20.752
For what?

26:20.753 --> 26:23.072
Suspicion of war crimes against civilians

26:23.073 --> 26:24.995
committed by you in
the Ngoma region of...

26:24.996 --> 26:30.002
Of Eastern Rwanda
on or around 11th June, 1994.

26:30.003 --> 26:34.032
I know. It was issued by
a French court in 2009.

26:34.033 --> 26:37.752
And I assume that is
an European Arrest Warrant.

26:37.753 --> 26:40.833
- For your extradition to France, yes.
- Yes.

26:43.073 --> 26:45.112
Now you should read me my rights.

26:45.113 --> 26:47.873
Sounds like you've been expecting us.

26:48.359 --> 26:50.279
For a long time.

29:25.500 --> 29:27.112
This you?

29:27.113 --> 29:28.993
My mother's.

29:29.545 --> 29:31.185
That's yours.

29:51.793 --> 29:53.500
A Promethium rock.

29:54.700 --> 29:56.912
Hope no-one tries to peck out your liver.

29:56.913 --> 29:59.272
I've got drugs doing that already.

29:59.273 --> 30:00.792
You got that under control?

30:00.793 --> 30:03.672
Clockwork. First one with
Good Morning Britain,

30:03.673 --> 30:05.112
second with Cash in the Attic.

30:05.113 --> 30:07.980
- Busy day.
- Only if I pick up a can opener.

30:09.140 --> 30:10.753
Still think she was wrong?

30:11.340 --> 30:13.700
Your argument.

30:14.193 --> 30:18.657
Well, I guess we will
never know now, will we?

30:19.026 --> 30:20.860
Want to find out?

30:23.233 --> 30:24.512
Why?

30:24.513 --> 30:26.411
Unless Star Trek Voyager

30:26.412 --> 30:28.593
is fulfilling all of
your emotional needs.

30:33.746 --> 30:36.866
That's about to start, actually.

30:44.553 --> 30:45.742
How?

30:45.767 --> 30:47.912
So, you think Nyamoya
was a national hero?

30:47.913 --> 30:49.872
It's not so simple.

30:49.873 --> 30:52.273
But you didn't want your
mother to prosecute him.

30:52.900 --> 30:55.232
Thing is, it's not always easy

30:55.233 --> 30:57.055
just to come out with the truth.

30:57.056 --> 30:59.352
It is to me. You just say it.

30:59.353 --> 31:04.233
But where you were born, you have
to pick your moment and your place.

31:04.660 --> 31:05.833
So?

31:06.580 --> 31:08.872
What if your mother

31:08.873 --> 31:12.190
didn't see Nyamoya as a destination,

31:12.977 --> 31:14.272
more a bridge?

31:14.273 --> 31:16.913
- To what?
- I don't know for sure.

31:18.473 --> 31:20.673
But this may be the way to find out.

31:23.260 --> 31:24.625
How?

31:24.626 --> 31:27.513
Alice Munezero's been arrested.

31:32.193 --> 31:34.639
The French think she killed
one of their priests in Rwanda

31:34.640 --> 31:36.713
- during the genocide.
- Why?

31:37.380 --> 31:39.232
They allege she found
the guy in his church

31:39.233 --> 31:41.513
with a couple of hundred dead Tutsis.

31:42.380 --> 31:45.313
Before asking any questions,
she shot him.

31:45.860 --> 31:47.072
And that's it?

31:47.073 --> 31:48.820
Certainly was for the priest.

32:00.073 --> 32:01.313
I drink.

32:01.931 --> 32:02.936
Yeah?

32:02.937 --> 32:05.104
At night, all alone.

32:05.484 --> 32:07.093
Sometimes quite a bit.

32:09.239 --> 32:11.140
- Alone?
- That's why I have him.

32:12.326 --> 32:14.646
Wouldn't look good, me on a DUI.

32:15.162 --> 32:16.354
No.

32:16.355 --> 32:18.512
Wouldn't want you to think
I was a snob, though.

32:18.513 --> 32:21.032
Just a lonely alcoholic.

32:21.033 --> 32:22.873
Quite a pair.

32:25.220 --> 32:26.672
You shouldn't trust me, you know.

32:26.673 --> 32:28.060
Why?

32:29.300 --> 32:30.660
My mind, it's...

32:32.465 --> 32:34.305
Normal, to feel like that.

32:35.839 --> 32:37.919
Nothing about me is normal.

32:38.593 --> 32:40.872
I pull back from everything. Everything.

32:40.873 --> 32:43.512
Even Eve. Particularly her.

32:43.513 --> 32:46.620
There's another way to look at that.
She was your centre.

32:46.904 --> 32:49.473
Well, now I'm cut loose.

32:51.540 --> 32:53.033
Let me take her place.

32:54.300 --> 32:56.112
You... You want to be my mother?!

32:56.113 --> 32:59.232
I want you to feel like there's
somebody at the centre of your life,

32:59.233 --> 33:01.153
for as long as you need it.

33:02.065 --> 33:03.105
What do you get?

33:04.753 --> 33:06.113
Yes.

33:06.740 --> 33:08.340
A replacement daughter.

33:11.593 --> 33:13.512
That's why I like you, Kate.

33:13.513 --> 33:16.032
You say the things other
people wouldn't dare.

33:16.033 --> 33:18.700
There you go, see? I'm doing it already.

33:19.700 --> 33:21.952
You go ahead.

33:21.953 --> 33:24.393
Maybe you're right.
Maybe it's what we both need.

33:26.626 --> 33:28.540
I know it's what Eve would want.

33:29.291 --> 33:30.931
And so would she.

33:39.620 --> 33:42.540
- Did you do it?
- No.

33:45.380 --> 33:48.033
And Michael's agreed to
be your lead counsel.

33:49.580 --> 33:52.058
With you investigating.

33:52.059 --> 33:53.540
He says you're the best.

33:54.316 --> 33:55.721
Well, if you're looking to employ

33:55.722 --> 33:57.618
a grief-stricken junkie on suicide watch,

33:57.619 --> 34:00.513
you certainly are in need
of legal representation.

34:01.085 --> 34:02.245
And here you are.

34:03.412 --> 34:04.972
But not for long.

34:05.713 --> 34:08.351
There is no way this charge
could stick under UK law,

34:08.353 --> 34:10.273
and, anyway, you're not a UK citizen.

34:10.775 --> 34:13.130
All you have to do now is
object to the extradition

34:13.132 --> 34:15.592
and you'll be home within a week.
Simple as that.

34:16.100 --> 34:19.659
Only thing that puzzles me is why
he hasn't told you that already.

34:21.429 --> 34:23.900
See? Just like her mother.

34:28.366 --> 34:31.632
Alice Munezero, I'm obliged in this place

34:31.632 --> 34:33.391
to make you aware formally

34:33.393 --> 34:35.513
of the contents of the Part 1 warrant.

34:36.060 --> 34:39.591
These are, that under
Articles 132 and 143.

34:39.592 --> 34:41.496
Code of Criminal Procedure,

34:41.496 --> 34:45.136
you are accused that on 11th June, 1994,

34:45.137 --> 34:49.726
as the commanding officer of a unit
within the Rwandan Patriotic Front,

34:49.726 --> 34:53.793
you advanced into Ngoma district,
Eastern Rwanda,

34:53.793 --> 34:56.632
where you did unlawfully
kill a French citizen

34:56.632 --> 34:58.792
by the name of Pascal Patenaude,

34:58.793 --> 35:00.952
a father in the
Order of the Grey Fathers,

35:00.953 --> 35:04.713
outside their church
in the diocese of Kibungo.

35:05.220 --> 35:06.952
And that this action took place

35:06.953 --> 35:10.632
under the category of
War Crimes against Civilians.

35:10.633 --> 35:12.913
Are you now aware of these contents?

35:13.460 --> 35:14.953
I am.

35:15.300 --> 35:17.273
And in the presence of your counsel,

35:17.580 --> 35:20.112
would you now indicate whether or not

35:20.113 --> 35:23.980
you are willing to consent
to the extradition proceedings?

35:27.753 --> 35:33.421
Madam, I wish to consent
to the extradition order.

35:33.422 --> 35:35.220
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

35:36.420 --> 35:39.473
Did your client understand
the question, Mr Ennis?

35:40.060 --> 35:41.273
She did, ma'am.

35:41.740 --> 35:43.792
She wishes to consent to the order?

35:43.793 --> 35:45.340
She does, ma'am.

35:46.353 --> 35:47.913
Very well.

35:57.193 --> 35:58.992
What have you done?!

35:58.993 --> 36:00.700
Taken her case to France.

36:01.900 --> 36:03.593
You knew this was going to happen.

36:04.180 --> 36:07.352
So did she.
She said as much at Mumma's funeral.

36:07.353 --> 36:10.393
I tipped off the NCA
to serve the warrant, yes.

36:10.980 --> 36:12.113
Why?

36:12.540 --> 36:14.432
Because it's been knocking
around for years.

36:14.433 --> 36:16.873
Every time she travels,
she's at risk of arrest.

36:17.260 --> 36:19.912
So finally, she's decided
just to flush it all out.

36:19.913 --> 36:22.152
By getting herself thrown
in a French jail?!

36:22.153 --> 36:23.346
How fucking stupid is that?!

36:23.347 --> 36:25.552
- You think?
- Yes, I... I know.

36:25.553 --> 36:28.352
Good. So now we're going to get her out.

36:28.353 --> 36:32.032
She shouldn't... she shouldn't be
there in the first place!

36:32.033 --> 36:34.232
And now we have a chance to prove that.

36:34.233 --> 36:35.472
God, this is so fucked up!

36:35.473 --> 36:38.312
Innocence is assumed, Michael.
You don't have to prove it!

36:38.313 --> 36:40.953
This isn't the destination, Kate.

36:41.420 --> 36:42.912
OK. Then what is?

36:42.913 --> 36:46.433
Well, that's what
we're looking to find out.

36:56.738 --> 36:59.100
_

37:25.860 --> 37:27.553
I am innocent.

37:28.060 --> 37:31.713
But you were leading
an advance infantry unit

37:31.714 --> 37:34.752
- through that region at that time?
- Yes.

37:34.753 --> 37:38.073
But you or any representative of yours

37:38.460 --> 37:42.193
made absolutely no contact
with Father Patenaude?

37:42.500 --> 37:46.152
I did not, nor did anyone under
my command, or in my knowledge.

37:46.153 --> 37:49.794
Um... except there are two,

37:49.795 --> 37:53.952
two eyewitnesses who
have sworn that you did.

37:53.953 --> 37:58.953
That you in fact, er...
murdered Father Patenaude.

37:59.300 --> 38:01.233
They are lying.

38:01.580 --> 38:02.992
Because?

38:02.993 --> 38:04.992
If I may, one moment.

38:04.993 --> 38:06.952
One of the alleged witnesses,

38:06.953 --> 38:09.472
an occupant of the village, a Hutu...

38:09.473 --> 38:11.319
And a doctor, monsieur.

38:11.320 --> 38:15.089
Nonetheless, his family
was subsequently tried

38:15.090 --> 38:18.153
and found guilty of mass killings.

38:18.580 --> 38:21.113
He is now living in
France as an ex-patriot.

38:21.500 --> 38:26.312
The conduct of one's family
is no cause for self-incrimination.

38:26.313 --> 38:28.992
I'll submit a pattern of influence.

38:28.993 --> 38:33.352
And, er... on the
other witness, monsieur?

38:33.353 --> 38:36.032
Also living in France.

38:36.033 --> 38:37.392
Who is a Tutsi

38:37.393 --> 38:41.872
and served as a lieutenant in
Mrs Munezero's own infantry unit.

38:41.873 --> 38:45.592
What pattern of influence
might you submit on him?

38:45.593 --> 38:46.913
He was a spy.

38:48.460 --> 38:49.713
For who?

38:51.180 --> 38:52.673
The French.

38:55.980 --> 38:57.313
Why?

39:00.180 --> 39:04.912
Because, sir, for many years,

39:04.913 --> 39:08.980
your country was on the side
of the genocide planners.

39:11.153 --> 39:15.460
And when the genocide happened
and my army brought it to an end,

39:17.180 --> 39:20.392
your country was too ashamed
to admit their guilt.

39:20.393 --> 39:23.713
And have instead tried
to tarnish my innocence.

39:24.420 --> 39:26.820
The one to try and cancel the other.

39:28.532 --> 39:30.252
And that cannot be.

39:34.126 --> 39:35.526
OK.

39:36.873 --> 39:40.152
Um... this investigation
was not launched by me.

39:40.153 --> 39:44.472
It was launched by a colleague ten
years ago who has since retired.

39:44.473 --> 39:48.752
A timescale of this length
reflects poorly on us

39:48.753 --> 39:52.313
whilst maintaining a
question mark upon you.

39:52.860 --> 39:55.912
So it is in the interest of all parties

39:55.913 --> 39:58.552
to bring this matter
to a swift conclusion.

39:58.553 --> 40:03.433
Either... I recommend
this dossier for trial,

40:03.780 --> 40:05.353
or I dismiss it.

40:06.513 --> 40:11.472
And for me to do that, you must
show me at least one of two things.

40:11.473 --> 40:13.512
Proof of your innocence

40:13.513 --> 40:15.553
or the guilt of your accusers.

40:24.553 --> 40:26.033
Thank you.

40:29.433 --> 40:31.332
When did his predecessor die?

40:31.333 --> 40:33.432
Um... about 18 months ago.

40:33.433 --> 40:35.673
A few months after he retired.

40:36.060 --> 40:37.273
Did he do that by choice?

40:37.620 --> 40:39.552
- Die?
- Retire.

40:39.553 --> 40:43.312
There was some talk of him running
for public office a few months back.

40:43.313 --> 40:45.753
His heart just couldn't keep up.
Worry you?

40:46.340 --> 40:48.913
Just wasn't expecting
the new guy to be so helpful.

40:49.580 --> 40:51.753
Well, don't go complaining,
he's just given her bail.

40:52.753 --> 40:56.392
Yeah. No. Yeah! It's good.

40:56.393 --> 40:57.872
C'est bon!

41:05.713 --> 41:08.752
So... Florence Patenaude.

41:08.753 --> 41:12.224
Yep. Er... Father Patenaude's mother.

41:12.225 --> 41:14.912
Made the initial complaint
which launched the investigation.

41:14.913 --> 41:16.672
- Is she still alive?
- Yeah.

41:16.673 --> 41:18.913
- Thank fuck for that!
- Yeah.

41:19.380 --> 41:22.673
She made a formal complaint in 1998.

41:23.060 --> 41:25.592
Four years after the alleged incident.

41:28.220 --> 41:30.032
Why the delay?

41:31.600 --> 41:33.600
_

41:33.614 --> 41:34.860
_

41:41.593 --> 41:44.113
No. No, sorry, I didn't get that.

41:44.860 --> 41:46.992
Her son had joined the Grey Fathers,

41:46.993 --> 41:49.005
so he was lost to her
long before his death.

41:50.006 --> 41:52.380
- The Grey Fathers is a holy order.
- I know.

41:53.140 --> 41:54.793
What made you change your mind?

41:57.594 --> 41:58.953
Monsieur Barre.

41:59.299 --> 42:00.299
Who?

42:00.753 --> 42:02.133
_

42:03.434 --> 42:04.913
Her sponsor.

43:19.945 --> 43:22.980
Mademoiselle, you've strayed.

43:24.393 --> 43:27.340
- No, I-I was just...
- Looking at the past.

43:33.753 --> 43:35.313
Thank you.

43:43.140 --> 43:46.352
My lawyer will be sitting
in with us. You understand.

43:46.353 --> 43:47.620
Of course.

43:49.940 --> 43:53.432
All this... from rubber.

43:53.433 --> 43:55.273
Three generations now.

43:57.313 --> 44:00.073
But I understand my inheritance.

44:00.460 --> 44:02.832
The benefits are obvious...

44:02.833 --> 44:05.032
the burdens, less so.

44:05.033 --> 44:07.713
Unless you were Congolese in the 1900s.

44:08.647 --> 44:09.859
Are you Congolese?

44:09.899 --> 44:11.259
English.

44:11.993 --> 44:13.672
But where are you from originally?

44:13.673 --> 44:16.033
Originally? Er... from loving parents.

44:19.753 --> 44:22.313
Why did you approach Florence Patenaude?

44:23.060 --> 44:26.792
Because I wanted, um... I
want to see justice done,

44:26.793 --> 44:29.912
and I didn't think she knew
she could have it for her son.

44:29.913 --> 44:32.704
And why, particularly,

44:32.705 --> 44:34.633
did you want her to have it?

44:35.902 --> 44:39.712
The Tutsi genocide is a
taboo subject, Mademoiselle,

44:39.713 --> 44:41.273
but its undeniable horror

44:42.020 --> 44:45.993
disguises a more complex truth.

44:47.580 --> 44:49.073
Which is...?

44:49.700 --> 44:51.432
What do you know about Rwanda?

44:51.433 --> 44:54.032
Er... what... What do you?

44:54.033 --> 44:56.102
A lot.

44:56.103 --> 45:00.033
I was advisor to the
Elysee Palace from 1987-'94.

45:00.460 --> 45:01.913
The lead-up to the genocide.

45:04.060 --> 45:06.953
And what did you advise
your president to do?

45:07.540 --> 45:10.873
Everything in his power to avoid it.

45:12.220 --> 45:13.273
Which was...?

45:13.900 --> 45:17.953
For him to support the
democratically-elected majority.

45:18.340 --> 45:19.393
The Hutus.

45:19.820 --> 45:21.873
Who were the majority.

45:22.260 --> 45:23.672
You have to remember, Mademoiselle,

45:23.673 --> 45:26.512
the Tutsis were always
a minority in Rwanda.

45:26.513 --> 45:28.872
14%, no more.

45:28.873 --> 45:31.072
Their monarchy ruled
for hundreds of years,

45:31.073 --> 45:32.512
and during the colonial era,

45:32.513 --> 45:35.392
the Belgians maintained
them as proxy rulers.

45:35.393 --> 45:39.256
But in '62, after the
independence and the elections,

45:39.257 --> 45:41.073
it was the Hutus who won the power.

45:41.540 --> 45:42.792
And so they should.

45:42.793 --> 45:45.633
85% of the population, plain and simple.

45:46.140 --> 45:48.552
The only reason why so many
Tutsis left the country

45:48.553 --> 45:50.393
is because they lost the power.

45:50.900 --> 45:54.309
Well, they were also being
threatened with mass extermination.

45:54.310 --> 45:57.832
Only because they wanted to take
back what was not rightfully theirs.

45:57.833 --> 46:02.313
When I became advisor,
the real danger was civil war.

46:04.260 --> 46:08.192
So, between '87 and '94,

46:08.193 --> 46:12.192
you advised your president
to support the Hutu government?

46:12.193 --> 46:14.992
The democratically-elected
majority, as I've said.

46:14.993 --> 46:18.152
- And the president took your advice?
- Yes.

46:18.153 --> 46:20.312
But it wasn't as if the Catholic Church

46:20.313 --> 46:22.832
hadn't been saying the
same thing for years.

46:22.833 --> 46:25.440
We, all of us, were simply assisting...

46:25.441 --> 46:29.312
Assisting a government that
turned into a genocidal regime.

46:29.313 --> 46:32.312
Only because the Tutsis
massed an army on the borders

46:32.313 --> 46:34.912
before launching an
occupation of the country!

46:34.913 --> 46:38.873
They created the fear,
the fear created the genocide!

46:39.460 --> 46:43.993
Once these Banyarwandas did
indeed invade, it was too late!

46:47.540 --> 46:48.673
I'm a Tutsi.

46:50.740 --> 46:52.673
And my family were all killed.

46:54.820 --> 46:56.313
Then I'm very sorry.

46:56.900 --> 46:58.460
But you must remember,

46:59.260 --> 47:01.592
the blame for their
death lies as much with

47:01.593 --> 47:03.712
the Tutsi who invaded the country

47:03.713 --> 47:06.620
as with the Hutu who held the machete.

47:18.473 --> 47:21.153
Do you realise how offensive
that remark is?

47:21.620 --> 47:25.352
I realise the truth is far more complex

47:25.353 --> 47:27.500
than you may wish to hear.

47:31.020 --> 47:34.152
It was all I could do
not to hit him myself.

47:34.153 --> 47:35.912
It's ugly, but he believes it.

47:35.913 --> 47:39.952
And prosecuting Alice, the
representative of the Tutsi army,

47:39.953 --> 47:41.512
for the murder of a French priest,

47:41.513 --> 47:43.633
a representative of his government,

47:44.140 --> 47:46.193
that's his way of proving it.

47:50.193 --> 47:52.433
- Do you want me to come back?
- No, no, no.

47:53.026 --> 47:54.506
Stay here.

48:09.673 --> 48:13.472
So... His two witnesses

48:13.473 --> 48:16.220
have failed to respond to
our request for an interview.

48:16.221 --> 48:17.872
No surprise.

48:17.873 --> 48:21.085
And, like here, under French law,

48:21.086 --> 48:22.832
there's no compulsion for them to do so.

48:22.833 --> 48:27.192
So I want you to go over and have
a chat with them, off book.

48:27.193 --> 48:28.352
OK.

48:28.353 --> 48:30.552
And remember, the limits of harassment

48:30.553 --> 48:32.832
are the same as here,
so stay within them.

48:32.833 --> 48:36.900
Ooh. Not sure subtlety's
my strongest suit.

48:39.193 --> 48:40.712
And yet you managed to hide

48:40.713 --> 48:43.433
your affair with Godwin
from almost everyone.

48:53.580 --> 48:55.993
Did Eve know?

48:58.673 --> 49:00.220
Just you.

49:01.546 --> 49:03.386
Guessing the wife did, too,

49:03.411 --> 49:06.220
or is there another reason
you didn't attend the funeral?

49:13.700 --> 49:15.513
Did you love him?

49:18.812 --> 49:20.172
He'd, er...

49:20.953 --> 49:23.380
He'd just blown me out, so...

49:24.233 --> 49:26.553
Kate.

49:27.020 --> 49:28.632
Are you feeling sorry for me?

49:28.633 --> 49:33.472
No. Just the... the weight of it.

49:33.473 --> 49:35.912
I'm used to that,

49:35.913 --> 49:38.753
losing things I love.
Been doing it all my life.

49:40.193 --> 49:46.513
So, er... don't expect me to
behave the way others do.

49:47.460 --> 49:48.873
I don't.

49:50.946 --> 49:52.266
Good.

49:54.799 --> 49:57.159
Someone is not telling us the truth.

49:58.820 --> 50:00.673
I'll speak to the witnesses.

50:33.719 --> 50:35.319
Dr Musoni.

50:35.953 --> 50:37.713
Avez-vous vos papiers?

50:38.340 --> 50:39.673
Excuse me?

50:39.940 --> 50:41.193
Where are you from?

50:41.740 --> 50:44.620
I am not a refugee.

50:45.460 --> 50:46.752
At least, not yet.

50:46.753 --> 50:49.060
I'm from Alice Munezero's legal team.

50:50.540 --> 50:52.272
Yeah.

50:52.273 --> 50:54.377
And you're a key witness
for the prosecution,

50:54.378 --> 50:58.272
but you haven't yet responded
to our request for an interview.

50:58.273 --> 50:59.553
I don't have to.

50:59.900 --> 51:01.512
No. No, you don't,

51:01.513 --> 51:03.872
but if you are found to
have given false testimony,

51:03.873 --> 51:06.116
well, it's called perjury.

51:06.117 --> 51:09.593
I'm sure you've heard of it, and
you'll be deported back to Rwanda.

51:09.946 --> 51:11.506
That won't happen.

51:12.900 --> 51:15.513
- Why?
- Because I'm telling the truth.

51:15.538 --> 51:17.926
Yes, fine, fine.

51:17.927 --> 51:21.032
But the legality of truth,
how it's defined,

51:21.033 --> 51:24.353
well, if I were you, I'd check on that.

51:25.571 --> 51:29.112
It's very good, what you're doing here.

51:29.113 --> 51:32.832
I have been one of them.

51:32.833 --> 51:37.273
Although I did stop by at
your home before coming here.

51:37.660 --> 51:39.913
It's a pretty impressive place.

51:41.319 --> 51:43.639
You've really made a
life for yourself here.

51:43.793 --> 51:46.233
Careful not to lose it.

52:13.793 --> 52:15.513
I'm so sorry.

52:16.707 --> 52:19.072
This is embarrassing.

52:19.073 --> 52:22.432
Um... my car, it won't start.

52:22.433 --> 52:24.632
And I need to call my office.

52:24.633 --> 52:26.433
I don't have a phone.

52:26.820 --> 52:29.632
- Not very professional?
- I know.

52:29.633 --> 52:31.993
I'm... I'm new.

52:33.153 --> 52:34.432
Could I borrow yours?

52:34.433 --> 52:36.552
- What?!
- I know we're on opposite sides,

52:36.553 --> 52:39.140
but we're both still human beings, right?

52:39.546 --> 52:42.266
Otherwise, I'll be tagging
around with you all day.

52:44.313 --> 52:46.193
I can give you...

52:48.073 --> 52:50.153
five, five euros.

52:56.433 --> 52:58.832
- Ennis.
- Hey, it's me.

52:58.833 --> 53:00.512
He called someone the moment I left.

53:00.513 --> 53:02.472
I've texted you a number.

53:02.473 --> 53:05.260
Yeah, got it!

53:06.153 --> 53:08.393
OK, I'll see if I can get you a name.

53:11.113 --> 53:14.393
I have a Michael Ennis on the phone.

53:16.140 --> 53:17.273
Put him through.

53:24.393 --> 53:25.632
Yep?

53:25.633 --> 53:27.833
- Are you hands-free?
- Yep.

53:29.073 --> 53:31.432
- You're not hands-free.
- No.

53:31.433 --> 53:34.432
His name is Tat Picot.

53:34.433 --> 53:35.992
He's DGSE.

53:35.993 --> 53:38.273
He's French Secret Service.

53:42.510 --> 53:44.193
Lieutenant Makuze?

53:45.180 --> 53:46.742
Who wants to know?

53:46.743 --> 53:49.872
My name's Kate Ashby, I work
for Alice Munezero's legal team.

53:49.873 --> 53:52.632
You're down as a key prosecution witness.

53:52.633 --> 53:55.180
I've just been speaking with Tat Picot.

53:56.153 --> 53:58.512
I thought it was really
interesting, what he had to say,

53:58.513 --> 54:00.277
and I just wondered what
you thought about it all,

54:00.278 --> 54:02.233
and how you feel about the risks.

54:02.660 --> 54:03.912
If you spoke with Tat Picot...

54:03.913 --> 54:05.712
So you do know him.

54:05.713 --> 54:08.393
And now he will know you.

54:17.259 --> 54:18.859
Won't that be cosy?

57:15.553 --> 57:17.433
What the fuck am I doing?
