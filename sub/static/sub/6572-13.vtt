00:03.836 --> 00:05.828
<i>This is Michael Bluth.</i>

00:05.939 --> 00:07.839
<i>Right now he's being honored
by his family.</i>

00:07.941 --> 00:11.707
Three years ago I made a choice
to keep this family together.

00:11.811 --> 00:15.907
- Today, it looks like I succeeded.
<i>- So why is this man crying?</i>

00:16.015 --> 00:21.511
<i>Because now he'll have to stay
with these people for a long, long time.</i>

00:21.621 --> 00:24.520
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

00:24.691 --> 00:28.092
<i>and the one son who had no choice
but to keep them all together.</i>

00:34.701 --> 00:36.396
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

00:38.705 --> 00:42.766
<i>Days earlier, Michael awoke
to find his son in his bed.</i>

00:42.876 --> 00:46.334
- Hey, are you scared of a monster?
- Kind of.

00:46.446 --> 00:50.644
<i>It was the monster called lust,
to which he'd recently succumbed.</i>

00:50.750 --> 00:53.878
And there's a chance
you might not even be related to us.

00:53.987 --> 00:56.820
<i>And although he'd only
gotten to second base...</i>

00:56.923 --> 01:00.757
<i>he'd gone in head first,
like Pete Rose.</i>

01:00.860 --> 01:02.760
<i>Then they both got
some distressing news.</i>

01:02.862 --> 01:05.387
And there you are, Maeby,
coming out of your mother's third base.

01:05.498 --> 01:07.398
You guys really are related.

01:07.500 --> 01:09.400
<i>- And that night...</i>
- You're not sleeping in here now.

01:09.502 --> 01:13.302
- You think that's a bad idea?
- What, I mean, so we can make out every night?

01:13.406 --> 01:15.306
Does that not work
for your schedule?

01:15.408 --> 01:18.639
I mean, I'm sure
we can control our...

01:18.745 --> 01:21.475
- I'm gonna go sleep with my dad.
- I'm gonna get my job back.

01:21.581 --> 01:24.311
You're probably just a little anxious
because your old man...

01:24.417 --> 01:27.853
is about to start running
a successful company for a change.

01:27.954 --> 01:29.751
So Pop-Pop is definitely
innocent, huh?

01:29.856 --> 01:31.756
No, not by a long shot...

01:31.858 --> 01:34.349
but they have dropped all the charges,
and not just the Iraq ones.

01:34.461 --> 01:36.827
The embezzlement,
the pension robbing.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.830
I don't know why they dropped them,
but they did.

01:38.932 --> 01:42.026
Let's see if we are on
<i>Mad Money,</i> huh?

01:42.135 --> 01:44.103
<i>And they deliver insulin right to my door.</i>

01:44.204 --> 01:47.503
It's probably on right after this ad.
This is gonna be great for us.

01:47.607 --> 01:50.474
It's gonna give us a chance
to spend some time together, you know?

01:50.577 --> 01:54.809
It's, like, I don't even know what's going on
in your life. Are there any girls or...

01:54.914 --> 01:58.042
Actually, I've been wrestling
with some pretty taboo...

01:58.151 --> 01:59.948
<i>- The Bluths. I love these guys.
- Shh, here it is.</i>

02:00.053 --> 02:03.181
<i>They beat the treason charges.
We had it as a don't buy.</i>

02:03.289 --> 02:05.689
<i>Let's bump it up to a risky.</i>

02:05.792 --> 02:08.727
Risky! There it is,
we're doing it, huh?

02:08.828 --> 02:11.296
- Are you happy?
- I'm really happy.

02:11.397 --> 02:14.161
- I wonder if we should move out of town.
- What?

02:14.267 --> 02:17.031
I feel like we've heard this whole
out of the woods thing a lot, you know.

02:17.137 --> 02:20.629
- And I just wouldn't mind... - What have
I always said is the most important thing?

02:20.740 --> 02:24.232
- Family.
- I was gonna say breakfast, but...

02:24.344 --> 02:26.335
Why don't we go over to Gangy's,
have a little of both?

02:26.446 --> 02:29.176
Later, we can talk
all this out, huh?

02:30.283 --> 02:33.218
I've heard that
a couple times too.

02:33.319 --> 02:38.416
<i>And so the family gathered for a celebratory
brunch, catered by a local restaurant.</i>

02:38.525 --> 02:44.157
- Hello.
- Risky! Risky! Risky!

02:44.264 --> 02:46.198
Look at that, Buster.
You would have lost a hand anyway.

02:46.299 --> 02:48.995
I'd like to make an announcement.

02:49.102 --> 02:51.832
We need to finish the party
we started three years ago.

02:51.938 --> 02:55.499
Finally name Michael CEO
of a thriving company.

02:58.678 --> 03:02.011
We'll prove to the world that nothing
can tear apart the Bluth family.

03:02.115 --> 03:04.140
In fact, I've already rented
the same boat.

03:04.250 --> 03:06.878
Oh, I'm not comfortable near the ocean
since the seal attack.

03:06.986 --> 03:09.454
- The ocean is my second biggest fear.
- Good, don't come.

03:09.556 --> 03:12.184
I need to be rubbing elbows,
not working your fork.

03:12.292 --> 03:14.453
- We'll find a new venue.
- Oh, and before I forget.

03:14.561 --> 03:16.529
No magic, Gob.

03:16.629 --> 03:18.460
Where is Gob?

03:18.565 --> 03:20.465
Oh, who knows?
I don't even know where he lives.

03:20.567 --> 03:23.035
- He doesn't live at Michael's?
- I've always pictured him in a lighthouse.

03:23.136 --> 03:26.401
Doesn't matter. Mom, I'm just
really flattered that you're willing to do this.

03:26.506 --> 03:30.272
And I was half worried that you'd all
be eager to sell your shares and cash out.

03:30.376 --> 03:32.571
We can do that?

03:32.679 --> 03:36.547
Yeah, but Stan Sitwell's always had
a wild hair to buy this business.

03:36.649 --> 03:38.981
It's the only hair
he's got. What?

03:39.085 --> 03:41.576
- He's an alpaca.
- He has alopecia.

03:41.688 --> 03:45.385
Lindsay, you know, if we did sell, it would
only mean like, what, two million dollars each.

03:45.491 --> 03:48.892
Two million! Two million!

03:48.995 --> 03:50.895
That sounds like a lot more
than it actually is.

03:50.997 --> 03:54.592
You've already spent $1,200 on eggs,
and that would be it forever.

03:54.701 --> 03:57.670
Keep in mind, we are building something
that is not only for our kids...

03:57.770 --> 03:59.965
it's also for George Michael
and Maeby's kids too.

04:00.073 --> 04:02.598
We can't have kids.
What's the matter... What are you say...

04:02.709 --> 04:05.303
- It's not even an option really.
- Eventually you'll want to.

04:05.411 --> 04:08.073
Sure, I may want to, you know, now.
It doesn't matter.

04:08.181 --> 04:10.741
Either way, I won't do
anything about it. Come on!

04:10.850 --> 04:12.909
Michael's right.
And I, for one, will not go back...

04:13.019 --> 04:16.113
to wondering whether there's going
to be enough food on the table.

04:16.221 --> 04:18.416
Might wanna start worrying about the table.

04:18.524 --> 04:22.585
It's fine for you to say, "Don't sell,"
but I'm gonna be 40 in three years, you know?

04:22.695 --> 04:25.721
You know, being twins,
our birthdays are pretty close to one another.

04:25.832 --> 04:28.596
Yeah, but a 40-year-old woman
has as much chance of getting married...

04:28.701 --> 04:31.431
as she does of getting attacked by a shark.

04:31.537 --> 04:34.005
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you were going to say seal.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.166
- Or a seal.
- Oh, God!

04:36.276 --> 04:39.677
You have nothing to worry about. You're a
beautiful woman. Any man would be lucky to have you.

04:39.779 --> 04:42.805
<i>Michael had given this speech
many times to Lindsay.</i>

04:42.915 --> 04:47.352
- I'm a giant fat pig.
- I don't know why you say stuff like that.

04:47.453 --> 04:49.853
Girls just grow faster than boys.

04:49.956 --> 04:52.618
Dinner's ready.
We're having Lindsay chops.

04:52.725 --> 04:57.788
What? I want her to be prepared in case
some bully at school is as clever as I am.

04:57.897 --> 05:01.298
<i>- No bully ever would be.</i>
- Oh, let's not forget, you're already married.

05:01.401 --> 05:02.800
- Hey, Mikey.
- Yes.

05:02.902 --> 05:04.836
I think I'm gonna
cash out myself...

05:04.937 --> 05:06.905
and maybe go down
to my little place in Cabo.

05:07.006 --> 05:10.669
What little place in Cabo, Dad? Did you build
yourself a hideout in case you needed to escape?

05:10.777 --> 05:14.213
- Of course not.
- I don't want you to worry, Dad.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.942
There's gonna be plenty of money
to be made from a business run honestly.

05:17.050 --> 05:20.383
Oh! Well, your mom's
not gonna allow for that.

05:20.486 --> 05:22.647
She'll do whatever it takes
to get her way.

05:22.755 --> 05:26.350
- You think the banana stand was our idea?
- It wasn't?

05:26.459 --> 05:29.360
<i>It wasn't.
Although they marketed the idea better...</i>

05:29.462 --> 05:32.090
<i>the Frozen Banana itself
was the brainchild...</i>

05:32.198 --> 05:34.723
<i>of a Korean immigrant
who threatened to sue them.</i>

05:34.834 --> 05:38.895
Your mother said she'd take care of it.
The guy was deported to Korea the next day.

05:39.005 --> 05:41.098
<i>Where his business never recovered.</i>

05:41.207 --> 05:44.040
You trying to tell me that all your crimes,
all your dishonesty...

05:44.143 --> 05:46.509
- she was behind it all?
- She's the queen, Michael.

05:46.612 --> 05:48.876
I was her king,
and now it's you.

05:48.981 --> 05:50.881
She may appear
all sweet and innocent and light...

05:50.983 --> 05:54.146
but she has a way
of controlling your behavior.

05:54.253 --> 05:56.517
I'm concerned about you.
Because I do not want to see...

05:56.622 --> 05:59.113
- He'll be fine.
- You'll be fine.

06:04.330 --> 06:06.298
<i>Michael went to cancel the reservation...</i>

06:06.399 --> 06:08.890
<i>on the party boat
Buster so feared.</i>

06:09.001 --> 06:11.367
- Gob!
<i>- When he saw Gob on a party boat of his own.</i>

06:11.471 --> 06:13.371
You might wanna untie
these ropes first.

06:13.473 --> 06:16.374
- Don't tell me how to flee, Michael.
- What are you doing here?

06:16.476 --> 06:20.242
- I kinda live here.
- Lighthouse wasn't far off.

06:20.346 --> 06:22.371
<i>Perhaps you can tell me
how you can afford a boat.</i>

06:22.482 --> 06:24.814
You mean on the paltry
1,500 a week you give me?

06:24.917 --> 06:26.714
I give you 500 a week.

06:26.819 --> 06:29.652
Yeah, well, somebody's drawing
a little one on those checks. No big deal.

06:29.756 --> 06:32.816
I was planning on using
my Bluth Company stock to pay for it.

06:32.925 --> 06:34.984
Sitwell's made me
a pretty nice little offer.

06:35.094 --> 06:37.961
- About that, Gob, you cannot sell now.
- I have to.

06:38.064 --> 06:40.589
Gob, you're gonna burn through this money
and have nothing, all right?

06:40.700 --> 06:42.600
You give a man a fish,
he'll eat for a night.

06:42.702 --> 06:45.364
- If you teach a man to fish...
- He'll wanna use your yacht.

06:45.471 --> 06:48.167
I don't want this thing smelling like fish.
I'm burning through my future for it.

06:48.274 --> 06:50.708
But you wouldn't understand that
because you're a robot.

06:50.810 --> 06:55.008
Although I don't suppose you'd be willing
to have the company buy it.

06:55.114 --> 06:57.844
<i>Well, you can't let Gob sell those shares.</i>

06:57.950 --> 06:59.975
What am I supposed to do?
He won't give up the yacht.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.111
- Ow! Ow! Ow!
- Keep your weight off it.

07:02.221 --> 07:05.156
- So lease it to him through the company.
- That just doesn't feel right.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.749
<i>Oh, really?
How would it feel to lose the company...</i>

07:07.860 --> 07:11.352
<i>to a man who has less hair on his !@%$
than I have on my !@%$#.</i>

07:11.464 --> 07:13.762
It can't be worse
than hearing that just was.

07:13.866 --> 07:16.096
I couldn't see through the glasses,
and I slid into the ladder.

07:16.202 --> 07:19.262
<i>Give Gob the boat. We need
to show the shareholders at this party...</i>

07:19.372 --> 07:21.272
<i>that the family is united.</i>

07:21.374 --> 07:25.708
It's a very small concession
to an important cause.

07:25.812 --> 07:28.406
<i>And so Michael sold out just a little.</i>

07:28.514 --> 07:31.779
Fine, I will give him the yacht.

07:31.884 --> 07:34.182
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, pal.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.187
Well, you said we could talk later.

07:36.289 --> 07:39.952
- Yeah. You excited about the party?
- I actually might skip that.

07:40.059 --> 07:43.995
What are you talking about? This party
is essential for the stockholders to see.

07:44.096 --> 07:47.156
I mean, we gotta show them
how close this family really is.

07:47.266 --> 07:50.258
This was as good an opening
as George Michael was going to get.

07:50.369 --> 07:52.735
- Maeby and I made out.
- Sorry?

07:52.839 --> 07:56.707
- Me too.
- What do you mean, Son? You kissed?

07:56.809 --> 07:59.471
Even a little more than that.

07:59.579 --> 08:01.479
I thought she wasn't
my real cousin.

08:01.581 --> 08:04.209
But then Uncle Tobias showed us
these really rough pictures...

08:04.317 --> 08:06.717
that proved that she was really
Aunt Lindsay's daughter.

08:06.819 --> 08:10.585
I just feel like I can't
be around her or Aunt Lindsay.

08:10.690 --> 08:13.056
They were really rough pictures.

08:13.159 --> 08:15.684
No, I remember their birth announcement
like it was yesterday.

08:17.497 --> 08:20.830
I mean, I know it's wrong,
you know, but my feelings are real...

08:20.933 --> 08:22.833
even if it was a mistake.

08:22.935 --> 08:26.427
Well, obviously,
acting on those feelings is not an option.

08:26.539 --> 08:28.871
She's a blood relative.

08:28.975 --> 08:32.102
I know.
I've seen the blood.

08:32.211 --> 08:36.113
- How long has this been going on?
- I don't know... 53 weeks?

08:36.215 --> 08:38.683
I can't be around her
with these feelings anymore...

08:38.784 --> 08:40.683
and that's why I'm not
going to this party.

08:40.785 --> 08:44.244
<i>And so Michael
made another compromise of his values...</i>

08:44.357 --> 08:48.555
<i>- for the sake of the business.</i> - Whatever
happened to that Ann we were both so crazy about?

08:48.661 --> 08:51.289
You know, maybe you could
bring her to the party.

08:51.397 --> 08:54.855
Yeah, Ann is the girl for us.

08:54.967 --> 08:58.869
<i>Michael's sister, meanwhile,
was doing some selling out of her own.</i>

08:58.971 --> 09:02.372
I'm not going to sell my five percent,
even though you haven't made an offer.

09:02.475 --> 09:06.036
- Which would be how much, by the way?
- Five percent?

09:06.145 --> 09:08.909
Lucille actually gave you less
than her natural children.

09:09.015 --> 09:12.917
I hope that's not a crack about
my hair color, lips, forehead, nose and teeth.

09:13.019 --> 09:15.817
Because at least I'm not wearing
a rayon sweater set on my face.

09:15.922 --> 09:19.449
It's alpaca actually. Cruelty-free.
Really narrows your choices.

09:19.559 --> 09:23.518
But that's not what I meant
when I said "natural child."

09:23.629 --> 09:26.826
Wait a minute.
You're saying I'm adopted?

09:26.933 --> 09:29.561
I'm sorry. I thought you knew.
Have I upset you?

09:29.669 --> 09:33.298
Are you kidding me? This is the happiest
I've been since the day I got my new nose.

09:33.406 --> 09:36.170
- I'm not a Bluth.
- You were almost a Sitwell.

09:36.275 --> 09:39.506
But 37 years ago, the Bluths
adopted you out from under us.

09:39.612 --> 09:42.479
So, we said good-bye to you,
our darling, little three-year-old.

09:42.582 --> 09:46.780
Uh, wait, three-year-old?
You said it was 37 years ago.

09:46.886 --> 09:49.980
Oh, yeah, right. Hey, we should
do something for your 40th next week.

09:50.089 --> 09:52.580
<i>This part of the news
Lindsay didn't take that well.</i>

09:52.692 --> 09:56.423
!@%$, let me !@%$#%!@$%#@!

09:56.529 --> 09:58.429
Get your !@%$#%!@$%#@!

09:58.531 --> 10:00.761
Be gentle, she's almost 40!

10:00.866 --> 10:03.767
<i>Maeby, meanwhile,
had returned to Tantamount Studios...</i>

10:03.869 --> 10:07.100
<i>where the word was
she was to be replaced...</i>

10:07.206 --> 10:10.141
<i>when it was discovered
she was not the age she claimed to be.</i>

10:10.242 --> 10:13.268
- Please don't fire me.
- Fire you? Are you kidding?

10:13.379 --> 10:16.212
I've already gotten 10 requests
for the TV rights to your story.

10:16.315 --> 10:18.840
You gotta get your family
to sign the release papers.

10:18.951 --> 10:22.387
This is the biggest thing to happen
since Uniprod hired that wee-brain...

10:22.488 --> 10:24.388
to run drama development.

10:27.226 --> 10:29.251
<i>Michael had compromised his morals...</i>

10:29.362 --> 10:31.489
<i>and was having trouble sleeping.</i>

10:31.597 --> 10:33.963
<i>Of course, some of that
was Lindsay.</i>

10:35.167 --> 10:38.193
- Are you drunk?
- A little. We need to talk.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.295
Yeah, I'll say.
Are you aware that your daughter...

10:40.406 --> 10:42.306
and my son
have been getting physical?

10:42.408 --> 10:44.308
I mean, can you imagine
anything more inappropriate?

10:44.410 --> 10:48.141
- Hey, I guess you can. What are you doing?
- I'm not your sister.

10:48.247 --> 10:50.807
- What? Hey, Lindsay.
- I'm adopted. And I'm three years older.

10:50.916 --> 10:52.975
- There must be some mistake.
- No, Mom confirmed it.

10:53.085 --> 10:55.110
And I know you've always
found me attractive.

10:55.221 --> 10:58.054
You've been telling me that
for the last 40 years.

10:58.157 --> 11:00.216
Please, Lindsay, this is crazy.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.385
If I don't get divorced
and remarried in the next month...

11:02.495 --> 11:05.157
I'm gonna sell those shares
and I'm gonna cash out.

11:05.264 --> 11:08.700
- So what do you say? <i>- But even Michael
couldn't sell out that much.</i>

11:08.801 --> 11:11.497
I'm just not that into older women.

11:14.273 --> 11:16.173
- You bastard!
- Aah!

11:18.411 --> 11:22.006
<i>Michael had just found out his sister was adopted.</i>

11:22.114 --> 11:24.514
<i>And the next morning,
he awoke to a worse surprise.</i>

11:24.617 --> 11:26.517
Oh, come on!

11:26.619 --> 11:28.712
I can't sleep
in the same room as her.

11:28.821 --> 11:30.880
She wants out of
this marriage, fine.

11:30.990 --> 11:34.448
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to sell the Bluth shares and move on.

11:34.560 --> 11:37.393
- You can't do that.
- They're my shares.

11:37.496 --> 11:41.762
No, I mean, you can't
spoon me like that.

11:41.867 --> 11:47.032
We need a new venue for the shareholders' party,
and it cannot be a boat.

11:47.139 --> 11:51.269
Now, if you can find something,
maybe I can fudge the books.

11:51.377 --> 11:54.904
Get you a Bluth Company salary, huh?
Maybe call you an events coordinator.

11:55.014 --> 11:57.915
Can we just lay here for a second
while I think about it?

11:58.017 --> 12:00.645
<i>Michael was making
compromises all over the place.</i>

12:00.753 --> 12:02.653
Sure.

12:04.657 --> 12:06.887
- I'll do it.
- Sounds great.

12:06.992 --> 12:10.621
<i>Soon, George Michael
went to Ann's to try to win her back.</i>

12:10.730 --> 12:14.632
<i>But her Uncle Paul told him
that Ann had moved in with her boyfriend.</i>

12:14.734 --> 12:18.568
<i>He also mentioned that we all only
had three more weeks on Earth...</i>

12:18.671 --> 12:22.107
<i>and that fossils were just something
the Jews buried in 1924.</i>

12:22.208 --> 12:24.005
<i>And so, feeling that
he couldn't go home...</i>

12:24.110 --> 12:29.571
<i>George Michael decided to seek out
his own creepy uncle.</i>

12:29.682 --> 12:31.673
<i>And Michael confronted his mother
about the adoption.</i>

12:31.784 --> 12:34.810
Look, she was better off with us.
He wanted to call her Nellie.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.480
Of course. Lindsay is the Nellie
from the photo.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.785
Why didn't you just tell people
she was adopted?

12:39.892 --> 12:42.656
Adopting a child we didn't want
just to stick it to a competitor?

12:42.762 --> 12:44.662
Oh, that would
make us look great.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.927
You're right, Mom. People would have
twisted that story to make you look bad.

12:48.033 --> 12:49.796
I don't see what the big deal is.

12:49.902 --> 12:54.532
We loved her just as much
as any of you normal kids. More than Gob.

12:54.640 --> 12:57.507
The big deal, Mom,
is that the family is falling apart.

12:57.610 --> 13:00.101
They're trying to sell their stock,
and I can't promise you...

13:00.212 --> 13:02.442
that I can keep everyone
together until the party.

13:02.548 --> 13:05.039
We'll pay them off.

13:05.151 --> 13:07.984
We'll call it
an accrued cash dividend.

13:08.087 --> 13:11.682
But they won't get their money
until they sign a document at the party...

13:11.791 --> 13:14.021
promising not to sell
for 10 years.

13:14.126 --> 13:16.117
So, it's embezzlement,
bribery and conspiracy?

13:16.228 --> 13:18.128
And a whole lot of love.

13:18.230 --> 13:20.221
All right, and perjury.

13:21.534 --> 13:24.401
- Oh, Michael.
- Hey. Oh!

13:24.503 --> 13:28.030
I booked a perfect location
and some wonderful performers for the party.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.040
We're having it at the Queen Mary.

13:30.142 --> 13:32.940
Queen Mary? That's a ship.

13:33.045 --> 13:35.639
Oh, no, no, no.
It's a chain of popular nightclubs.

13:35.748 --> 13:37.648
Although I haven't been
to this particular location.

13:37.750 --> 13:40.310
- It's on the Long Beach Harbor.
- That's the ship.

13:40.419 --> 13:42.887
Don't worry about it.
They've actually welded it to the dock.

13:42.988 --> 13:45.513
Although, perhaps
I should call the Hot Cops...

13:45.624 --> 13:48.923
and tell them to come up
with something more nautically themed.

13:49.028 --> 13:52.555
Hot Sailors.
Better yet, Hot Se...

13:52.665 --> 13:57.034
- I like Hot Sailors.
- Mm, me too.

13:57.136 --> 14:01.072
<i>George Michael was about
to come across a hot seaman of his own.</i>

14:01.173 --> 14:03.767
- Gob?
- What are you doing here? How'd you find me?

14:03.876 --> 14:06.504
My dad said that you were living
down here with your girlfriend.

14:06.612 --> 14:08.842
You know about her?

14:08.948 --> 14:11.007
- Who?
- Ann.

14:14.053 --> 14:16.521
- Her?
<i>- Gob had been dating Ann...</i>

14:16.622 --> 14:20.023
<i>since he awarded her third place
in an inner beauty pageant.</i>

14:20.125 --> 14:25.859
<i>Since then, Ann and her friends
tried to teach Gob about the Holy Trinity.</i>

14:25.965 --> 14:27.899
What? I thought that's what
all you guys lived for.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.468
<i>While Gob debased everything they believed in.</i>

14:30.569 --> 14:32.730
What about you, you game?

14:32.838 --> 14:34.863
It's really not that big of a deal,
George Michael. I'm 18 now.

14:34.974 --> 14:36.908
And besides we really haven't
even done anything.

14:37.009 --> 14:39.273
Practically nothing.

14:39.378 --> 14:41.938
But what are you gonna do?
The girl obviously needs a man.

14:42.047 --> 14:44.140
<i>And that's when George Michael became one.</i>

14:45.551 --> 14:49.214
<i>Ann was upset.</i>

14:49.321 --> 14:52.950
<i>As was Buster when he saw
the ship where the party was to be held.</i>

14:55.895 --> 14:59.422
<i>And so Michael accepted his congratulations...</i>

14:59.531 --> 15:02.227
<i>all the while looking for his son.</i>

15:02.334 --> 15:04.894
<i>And Buster was approached
by his loving father.</i>

15:05.004 --> 15:07.734
Do you think there's any chance this ship
could break away from the dock?

15:07.840 --> 15:09.899
- We're on a ship?
- Ah...

15:10.009 --> 15:12.068
<i>Maeby was trying
to get the family to sign away...</i>

15:12.177 --> 15:14.304
<i>the TV rights to their life stories.</i>

15:14.413 --> 15:16.745
TV is not as good as it used to be,
huh, Uncle Buster?

15:16.849 --> 15:19.784
But you could help me out
by signing my petition to make it better.

15:19.885 --> 15:22.183
Oh, I kind of like
<i>Skating with Celebrities.</i>

15:22.288 --> 15:24.779
- Excuse me. <i>- Lucille was
trying to get signatures too.</i>

15:24.890 --> 15:26.858
Sign here that you won't sell.

15:26.959 --> 15:28.859
Oh, I don't need to sell, Lucille...

15:28.961 --> 15:31.589
because now I know that we're not related,
I'm going to marry Michael.

15:31.697 --> 15:33.597
I always saw him
with a younger girl.

15:33.699 --> 15:35.826
<i>And Gob, angry at Michael...</i>

15:35.935 --> 15:39.166
<i>- for sending his son to the docks...</i>
- Not related?

15:39.271 --> 15:43.071
<i>Went into a kind of
knee-jerk revenge mode.</i>

15:43.175 --> 15:46.303
Why go for the best
when you can go for the rest...

15:47.579 --> 15:50.139
of your life with a younger man?

15:51.583 --> 15:54.950
Kitty likes to scratch.

15:55.054 --> 15:59.388
Oh, God! Mom! Mom!

15:59.491 --> 16:02.790
Take these forms
to everyone in the family...

16:02.895 --> 16:05.864
and promise them a hundred grand
if they sign.

16:05.965 --> 16:09.662
<i>That's how Maeby found a way
to get signatures on her release forms.</i>

16:09.768 --> 16:11.963
Well, that was a freebie.

16:12.071 --> 16:15.529
<i>And soon, the crowd gathered to hear Michael.</i>

16:15.641 --> 16:19.338
I just wanna say how much
this family really means to me.

16:19.445 --> 16:21.936
My father has always
been there for me.

16:22.047 --> 16:24.982
He's a great man.

16:25.084 --> 16:27.951
My brother Gob, who I know
would never do anything...

16:28.053 --> 16:29.987
to hurt anyone in this family.

16:30.089 --> 16:32.353
<i>Except for dating his nephew's girlfriend...</i>

16:32.458 --> 16:35.018
<i>and hitting on his adopted sister.</i>

16:35.127 --> 16:38.392
Buster, who faced his biggest fear
to be here today...

16:38.497 --> 16:41.523
- Second biggest.
- And my sister, Lindsay.

16:41.633 --> 16:46.093
Yes, she is my sister,
no matter what any piece of paper says.

16:46.205 --> 16:48.696
Lindsay and her husband,
Tobias, you know...

16:48.807 --> 16:52.675
deep down, they both love
each other very, very much.

16:52.778 --> 16:57.511
Most of all, my mother,
who has always believed in me.

16:57.616 --> 16:59.743
Three years ago
I made a choice...

17:03.789 --> 17:07.247
I made a choice
to keep this family together...

17:07.358 --> 17:10.795
<i>And that's when Michael finally cried.</i>

17:10.896 --> 17:13.364
Today, it looks like I succeeded.

17:15.099 --> 17:17.397
<i>It wasn't exactly a turn-on.</i>

17:23.308 --> 17:25.037
Whoo !@%$# baby.

17:25.144 --> 17:27.544
Looks like George Michael
got his mom back today, huh?

17:27.646 --> 17:29.705
Yeah, well, where is
George Michael, by the way?

17:29.815 --> 17:32.045
He came by the yacht.
Gave me this shiner.

17:32.151 --> 17:33.880
- He hit you? What for?
- You know teenagers.

17:33.986 --> 17:36.386
Probably lashing out at you
because of who I'm dating.

17:36.488 --> 17:38.217
- Who are you dating?
- Ann.

17:38.323 --> 17:41.053
- Her?
- Don't worry. I didn't fight back or anything.

17:41.160 --> 17:43.458
I was, like, " Oh, no, take the yacht.
Please don't hurt me."

17:43.562 --> 17:46.588
- Just build up the little guy's self-esteem.
- The yacht?

17:46.698 --> 17:49.826
Oh, for God's sake, Gob.
I gotta get off this ship.

17:49.935 --> 17:52.733
Mom, George Michael took off in Gob's yacht.
I gotta go find him.

17:52.838 --> 17:56.069
Well, you can't go now. That's not going
to look good in front of the investors.

17:56.175 --> 17:58.143
- Mom, this is important, okay?
- Michael!

17:58.243 --> 18:00.939
This company is important.

18:01.046 --> 18:03.014
<i>It was at that moment that Michael realized...</i>

18:03.115 --> 18:05.606
<i>how much he'd sold out.</i>

18:05.717 --> 18:10.211
<i>Never seen a CEO cry like that before,
except at his sentencing.</i>

18:10.322 --> 18:12.586
That's who you're putting in charge?

18:12.691 --> 18:14.750
I've made a huge mistake.

18:14.860 --> 18:17.556
Will you take the company
for 20% above market?

18:17.663 --> 18:19.961
Ten, and I'll take
the company off your hands right now.

18:20.065 --> 18:21.999
Fifteen and I'll throw in Nellie.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.932
- She's 40.
- Twelve.

18:24.036 --> 18:27.164
<i>Meanwhile, Michael searched the harbor...</i>

18:27.272 --> 18:30.435
<i>and spotted the yacht.</i>

18:30.542 --> 18:33.272
<i>And Gob noticed something too.</i>

18:35.280 --> 18:37.646
Are those police boats?

18:37.749 --> 18:40.217
- Oh, my God, the SEC.
- They still have boats?

18:40.319 --> 18:43.186
- Prepare to be boarded.
- Did you do this?

18:43.288 --> 18:46.621
No. But I can't help but enjoy the irony
that you might be losing three years of your life.

18:46.725 --> 18:51.219
Ah, this is why they dropped
those other charges.

18:51.330 --> 18:54.322
- You gave me up, George.
- George? I'm not George.

18:54.433 --> 18:56.958
George invited me.
Oh, stupid.

18:57.069 --> 19:00.698
Oscar, when are you going to learn
there's no such thing as free shrimp?

19:00.806 --> 19:03.900
Well, I know it was someone
in this family.

19:04.009 --> 19:07.467
Or someone who used to be.

19:07.579 --> 19:09.376
- Annyong?
- Annyong.

19:09.481 --> 19:12.006
- Annyong?
- Annyong. But my real name is...

19:12.117 --> 19:14.642
- Hello.
- Hello?

19:14.753 --> 19:17.051
- Annyong.
- What the hell did you do this for?

19:17.156 --> 19:19.852
Because my grandfather
vowed one day...

19:19.958 --> 19:22.756
he would get even
for banana stand you stole from him.

19:22.861 --> 19:26.661
<i>It was true. Hello had gathered
information against Lucille...</i>

19:26.765 --> 19:29.825
<i>- Annyong?</i>
<i>- to avenge his grandfather.</i>

19:29.935 --> 19:32.267
Hey, Maeby ever mention
my name?

19:32.371 --> 19:34.669
<i>But Lucille was not going peacefully.</i>

19:34.773 --> 19:36.934
You boys know how to shovel coal?

19:37.042 --> 19:40.409
<i>I don't even wanna tell you
what these guys thought that meant.</i>

19:40.512 --> 19:43.106
<i>And Michael caught up
with his son.</i>

19:43.215 --> 19:45.342
George Michael, what are you doing?

19:45.450 --> 19:47.418
- Where are you going?
- I can't stay here.

19:47.519 --> 19:51.819
Ann's moved on. Maeby's my cousin.
We both know that's not an option.

19:51.924 --> 19:55.291
Buddy, Maeby is not your cousin.

19:55.394 --> 19:58.693
- What?
- Yeah, I found out a couple days ago.

19:58.797 --> 20:01.027
Aunt Lindsay was adopted.

20:01.133 --> 20:03.567
Why didn't you tell me this?

20:03.669 --> 20:06.297
Because you can't be
with Maeby. You're 15.

20:06.405 --> 20:10.034
Inevitably, the relationship is gonna fall apart,
and then what do you do?

20:10.142 --> 20:13.805
She might not be a blood relative,
but she is still family...

20:13.912 --> 20:16.380
and that's a bond
that lasts forever.

20:16.481 --> 20:19.211
You don't wanna rock that boat.

20:19.318 --> 20:21.878
- What the hell was that?
<i>- It was his mother...</i>

20:21.987 --> 20:24.649
<i>who moments earlier
had taken control of another queen.</i>

20:24.756 --> 20:27.316
Full steam, boys!

20:27.426 --> 20:30.224
This is degrading.
I thought we were gonna strip.

20:30.329 --> 20:33.423
Mother!

20:35.834 --> 20:39.497
It's moving! Oh, my God!

20:39.605 --> 20:42.733
<i>And Buster faced his second biggest fear.</i>

20:42.841 --> 20:44.809
- I can't swim! I can't swim!
<i>- And then his first.</i>

20:48.580 --> 20:50.639
Oh, come on!

20:50.749 --> 20:53.115
<i>And the two grand ladies
made their escape together.</i>

20:53.218 --> 20:55.618
<i>Lucille Bluth, please pull over...</i>

20:55.721 --> 20:57.621
