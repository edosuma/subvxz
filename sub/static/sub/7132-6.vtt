WEBVTT

00:12.041 --> 00:16.000
They want us to refocus
the show on the Boys,
and less on you and Morning.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.458
They think Stoke
is a breakout star.

00:19.458 --> 00:22.625
MATT:  With the hair?
It always comes down
to the fucking hair.

00:22.625 --> 00:24.083
I'm sure it's just swollen.

00:24.333 --> 00:26.000
It'll come down.

00:26.333 --> 00:28.250
It already came down.

00:28.250 --> 00:30.625
It's a cheek implant!
It's supposed to be up!

00:31.083 --> 00:32.291
Is it terrible?

00:33.375 --> 00:37.333
Why don't you, uh, go over
to the set so we can
see it in the light.

00:37.333 --> 00:38.500
Okay.

00:39.083 --> 00:41.750
(CHUCKLING) Yeah,
'cause light's
gonna help.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.458
500 feet, Labia!
500 feet!

00:44.458 --> 00:46.000
BEVERLY: How long has
she been stalking you?

00:46.000 --> 00:48.250
I met her
when she was like, eight.

00:48.250 --> 00:50.041
She was one of those
Make-A-Wish kids.

00:50.041 --> 00:51.041
Oh, my God.

00:51.041 --> 00:52.542
I slept with her once.
(GASPS)

00:52.542 --> 00:53.709
Once!
Oh, God.

00:53.709 --> 00:56.709
She was 18,
and really cute,

00:56.709 --> 00:58.083
once her hair grew back.

00:58.500 --> 00:59.917
I believe
you will burn in hell.

00:59.917 --> 01:01.917
Ah,
what're you going to do?

01:08.583 --> 01:10.208
(WIND WHISTLING)

01:14.875 --> 01:16.333

(GUNSHOT)

01:57.208 --> 01:58.750
(CLEARS THROAT)

02:00.667 --> 02:02.917
Hi.
Jesus! Fuck!

02:02.917 --> 02:04.959
I was hoping
you wouldn't
come home yet.

02:04.959 --> 02:06.250
The cookies
aren't ready.

02:06.834 --> 02:08.125
How the hell
did you get in here?

02:08.125 --> 02:10.125
The laundry room
window was open.

02:10.125 --> 02:12.959
You know,
you should talk to Rosa,
'cause that's not smart.

02:13.959 --> 02:16.291
Okay, the fact that you know
my housekeeper's name

02:16.291 --> 02:19.291
may be the scariest thing
out of a lot of scary things!

02:19.291 --> 02:21.291
You want milk
with your cookies?
No!

02:21.875 --> 02:22.917
Beer?

02:24.750 --> 02:25.625
(SIGHING) Sure.

02:31.500 --> 02:32.834
So is this place
a rental?

02:32.834 --> 02:35.417
'Cause it doesn't
really feel like you.

02:36.625 --> 02:38.083
Yeah, it's a rental.

02:38.083 --> 02:39.125
(WATER RUNNING)

02:39.125 --> 02:40.667
It's closer to the studio.

02:40.667 --> 02:42.166
That makes sense.

02:42.583 --> 02:45.375
'Cause the commute
to your beach place
is nuts.

02:45.375 --> 02:48.000
Whenever I drive
out there to sit
in front of your house,

02:48.000 --> 02:49.500
the traffic...
Oh, my God.

02:49.500 --> 02:53.000
It's, like,
"This is almost
not worth it."

02:53.583 --> 02:55.709
Where are your clothes?
Why?

02:55.709 --> 02:59.875
Why? Because
you're standing here
in my house, naked.

02:59.875 --> 03:03.125
I'm not naked.
I like to leave
a little mystery.

03:03.125 --> 03:05.917
Yeah, it's like
Agatha Christie
down there.

03:05.917 --> 03:07.291
I can take them off
if you want.

03:07.291 --> 03:12.458
No! I want you to put
the rest of your
shit on and go. Go!

03:13.083 --> 03:17.000
Why are you being so mean?
I'm making you cookies.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.291
I'm not being mean!
I'm tired and
I want to go to bed.

03:21.166 --> 03:22.166
Alone!

03:22.583 --> 03:24.375
You are being mean.

03:25.291 --> 03:26.792
I have cancer.

03:29.333 --> 03:30.875
You had cancer.

03:31.834 --> 03:35.333
And you survived and you're
healthy and that's awesome.

03:36.208 --> 03:38.583
And it's why I feel okay
saying to you,

03:38.583 --> 03:42.417
"Get the fuck out
of my house, you crazy
looney-tunes freak!"

03:42.417 --> 03:44.000

03:47.208 --> 03:49.250
All right,
I'm calling the police.

03:49.250 --> 03:51.208
If you don't want to be
here when they come,
you should go now.

03:51.583 --> 03:52.667
Okay.

03:54.291 --> 03:56.500
I love you so much.
I know.

03:56.792 --> 03:58.375
No one will ever
love you like I do.

03:58.375 --> 03:59.417
Mmm-hmm.

03:59.417 --> 04:02.375
I mean it.
I would die for you.

04:03.208 --> 04:05.083
Yeah, but you didn't.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.250
So, how're we
doing here?

04:15.250 --> 04:18.000
Almost done.
It just has to set.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.458
And this is really
going to work?

04:19.458 --> 04:23.291
Absolutely.
These men are wizards.
They can do anything.

04:26.083 --> 04:27.083
It is going
to work, right?

04:27.625 --> 04:29.250
Oh! Got me.

04:30.250 --> 04:32.417
Beverly, this is
my kid brother Rob.
Feel free to hit him.

04:32.417 --> 04:35.208
Oh! So you're not
one of the special
effects' wizards?

04:35.208 --> 04:37.500
Oh, no, no, no!
No, I just drove her in.

04:37.500 --> 04:40.166
What do you say we take
a look at this on camera?

04:41.417 --> 04:45.125
(LAUGHING) Whoa.
She is really feeling
those pain pills.

04:45.125 --> 04:46.291
Sorry?

04:46.291 --> 04:47.875
"Kid brother?"

04:48.750 --> 04:52.667
She stopped telling people
I was her
kid brother 20 years ago.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.959
You're not really,
are you?
What?

04:54.959 --> 04:56.125
Younger?

04:56.125 --> 04:57.834
Yeah, I am.
Three years.

04:57.834 --> 05:01.458
Hey, I don't have
a team of doctors
working on me full time.

05:01.959 --> 05:04.792
(SIGHING) On the other
hand, both my cheeks
are in the right place.

05:04.792 --> 05:06.291
(CHUCKLES)

05:07.208 --> 05:12.834
Well, it's insane.
Why does she do it?
She's so beautiful.

05:12.834 --> 05:14.291
Sure... Now.

05:15.083 --> 05:16.709
(BOYS LAUGHING)

05:17.291 --> 05:19.250

05:34.500 --> 05:37.500

you know that
Man of the Year thing

05:37.500 --> 05:38.667
you're gonna be
giving me?

05:38.667 --> 05:40.417
Do you know what
you're gonna say yet?

05:40.417 --> 05:43.041
No. Not yet. I still got
a couple weeks, right?

05:43.041 --> 05:44.625
Yeah, yeah.

05:44.625 --> 05:48.500
By the way, if you're doing
any jokes, maybe don't
mention the bald thing?

05:48.500 --> 05:52.667
I'm thinking of getting
these microplugs, I'd rather
not shine a light up there,

05:52.667 --> 05:54.083
if you know what I mean.

05:54.083 --> 05:57.959
What're you talking about?
You don't need microplugs.
You look great.

05:57.959 --> 06:01.333
Ah, you're sweet.
Listen, there was
one other thing.

06:02.542 --> 06:03.875
Sure.

06:04.125 --> 06:06.000
We've started talking about
what we wanna promote for
sweeps.

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
And we really want to make
a push for  Pucks!
So we need something big.

06:12.083 --> 06:15.542
Maybe you can get that kid
to grow his hair a little
longer. I'd watch that.

06:15.542 --> 06:19.583
(LAUGHING) Funny.
Here's what I'm thinking.

06:20.291 --> 06:25.291
Any chance you could get
one of the other Friends
to do a guest spot?

06:25.291 --> 06:27.500
Yeah. Here's what's
a little weird.

06:27.500 --> 06:29.917
A couple weeks ago,
you were cutting my
part down to nothing,

06:29.917 --> 06:32.750
and now you're calling,
asking me for favors...

06:32.750 --> 06:35.625
Hey! Hey! Hey!
It's all for the
good of the show.

06:35.625 --> 06:39.500
Totally get that.
But right now, I'm also
thinking about the good of me.

06:39.500 --> 06:43.083
Okay, how about this?
You get me one
of the Friends,

06:43.083 --> 06:47.125
and I give you my word,
all of our  Pucks!
promotion
will be about you.

06:47.125 --> 06:48.709
And not about the hair.

06:49.291 --> 06:50.583
No hair.

06:50.583 --> 06:52.667
I said no hair.

06:54.417 --> 06:56.166
All right. Let me
make a few calls.

06:56.166 --> 07:02.125
(LAUGHS) Great. And hey,
listen we gotta do lunch again
soon. I miss you, you bastard.

07:02.125 --> 07:04.542
Absolutely. Any time.
I'd love it.

07:15.875 --> 07:18.458
And here,
$40,000 later,

07:18.458 --> 07:20.875
is how she's going
to look on TV.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.625
(PEOPLE EXCLAIM IN AWE)

07:25.250 --> 07:27.917
Seriously, you guys,
thank you.
You saved my life.

07:27.917 --> 07:31.417
Well, it's all in a day's
work, if you've got
a very strange job.

07:31.417 --> 07:32.417
All right.
Catastrophe averted.

07:32.417 --> 07:34.917
Why don't we all
get back to work.

07:37.917 --> 07:39.625
Isn't that amazing?

07:39.625 --> 07:40.583
Yeah.

07:41.834 --> 07:43.458
Rather blasÃ©.

07:43.458 --> 07:46.291
Uh... I was in
Lost in Space.

07:46.291 --> 07:49.375
We weren't actually
"lost in space."

07:49.375 --> 07:50.458
Ah!

07:51.834 --> 07:52.875
I didn't see it.

07:52.875 --> 07:54.083
Really?
Hmm.

07:54.083 --> 07:56.000
I've seen
all your movies.

07:57.792 --> 08:00.083
Hey, can I talk
to you for a sec?

08:00.083 --> 08:01.458
Sure. What's up?

08:02.291 --> 08:03.583
My brother thought
you were great.

08:03.583 --> 08:05.125
And he doesn't
like anyone.

08:05.125 --> 08:06.625
A man after
my own heart.

08:06.625 --> 08:09.792
Anyway, he wanted to know
if you're available,
so I said I'd suss it out.

08:09.792 --> 08:11.667
So this is me sussing.

08:13.208 --> 08:15.083
(SIGHING) Ooh!
Good... Goodness.

08:17.333 --> 08:19.959
Why don't we
suss over here.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.834
Oh. Gotcha.

08:25.458 --> 08:27.000
I think your
brother's very nice,

08:27.000 --> 08:32.542
but I'm not doing
anything till I'm certain
what's happening with

08:34.458 --> 08:35.917
me and Sean.

08:36.417 --> 08:40.875
Oh, wow.
Okay, sure.
Absolutely.

08:41.917 --> 08:43.291
No problem.

08:45.709 --> 08:46.625
Aw.

08:49.250 --> 08:51.500
BEVERLY:  I'm getting
pity looks from Morning!

08:51.500 --> 08:52.792
Pity looks!

08:53.333 --> 08:55.208
My life has hit
a new low.

08:55.208 --> 08:56.417
Aw.

08:56.417 --> 08:57.500
I don't need them
from you, too!

08:57.500 --> 08:59.792
I'm sorry! I just...

08:59.792 --> 09:02.000
Look, I think it's great
you're waiting for Sean.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.250
But I gotta say,
at a certain point,

09:04.250 --> 09:08.166
don't you think it's, maybe,
time to think about...

09:09.000 --> 09:10.041
(SIGHS)

09:10.041 --> 09:11.625
Moving on?
Mmm.

09:11.625 --> 09:14.125
Are we going to
have the "moving on"
conversation again?

09:14.125 --> 09:17.542
Which, by the way,
coming from you,
is so steeped in irony...

09:17.542 --> 09:21.125
Hey! No need to get mean.
Let's keep it hikey here.

09:21.125 --> 09:22.417
Sorry.

09:23.333 --> 09:26.458
So how is the brother?
Is he cute?

09:26.458 --> 09:29.333
Oh, I'd say
way past cute.

09:29.333 --> 09:31.250
Like hot?

09:31.250 --> 09:33.125
Not that I noticed,
but oh, my God!

09:33.125 --> 09:37.542
Oh! Oh! Then maybe
one date. One date!

09:37.542 --> 09:41.125
A cup of coffee with a guy
is hardly moving on.

09:41.125 --> 09:43.417
No! Nope, nope, nope.
(SIGHING)

09:43.834 --> 09:48.041
Meanwhile, has Sean
been doing any moving on?
(CHUCKLES)

09:49.083 --> 09:50.208
Tell me!

09:53.917 --> 09:58.083
I found out he had
a little thing
with Morning.

09:58.083 --> 10:00.625
Shut the front door!
(GASPS)

10:00.625 --> 10:03.333
Apparently,
it was just one time.

10:03.333 --> 10:08.250
That is crazy. And now
she's trying to fix you
up with her brother?

10:09.667 --> 10:14.625
How wild would it be if Sean
ended up with Morning and you
ended up with the brother?

10:14.625 --> 10:17.959
Oh! I am so going
to make that a show!

10:17.959 --> 10:19.417
Oh, come on!
(SCOFFS)

10:19.417 --> 10:24.250
A husband and wife
get divorced and hook up
with a brother and sister?

10:24.250 --> 10:27.750
If somebody pitched me that,
I'd buy it in the room.

10:27.750 --> 10:30.917
Ooh! Unless you and Sean
want to write it.

10:32.917 --> 10:33.834
I mean it!

10:34.667 --> 10:39.583
I will guarantee you
six on the air, right
here on this trail!

10:43.458 --> 10:46.917
Lisa Kudrow! Hey!
It's Matt LeBlanc.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.458
Hello?

10:51.458 --> 10:54.625
Oh, you didn't say anything,
so... How are you?

10:56.250 --> 10:59.000
Well, "fine" is good.
Better than not fine.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
So, uh, listen,
you know I've got this
little TV show, right?

11:05.500 --> 11:07.000
Well, I do.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.000
Now, I know you're
really, really busy,

11:10.000 --> 11:13.500
but any chance you might
want to do a guest thing?

11:15.792 --> 11:17.625
Apologize? For what?

11:20.709 --> 11:22.125
I said that?

11:22.834 --> 11:24.125
Was I drunk?

11:24.875 --> 11:27.792
No, I'm not saying that
makes it okay, but...

11:30.333 --> 11:33.250
Well, if I said that...

11:33.250 --> 11:36.291
Okay, okay, no,
I believe you, I said it.

11:37.959 --> 11:40.625
Well, I am incredibly sorry.

11:43.291 --> 11:49.875
Lisa. Lisa. Lisa.
I don't know what more
I can say. I apologize.

11:49.875 --> 11:54.750
But, seriously, a person
can't make an innocent
comment one time?

11:57.542 --> 11:59.917
Jesus, when did
I say that?

11:59.917 --> 12:06.542
David. David. David.
I don't know what joke
you're talking about.

12:06.542 --> 12:08.834
Tell me what
I said to you.

12:11.583 --> 12:13.333
How is that
anti-Semitic?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.166
Oh! No, I can see that.

12:19.041 --> 12:22.333
You got to admit though,
it's still kind of funny.

12:22.625 --> 12:26.458
Mr. Perry!
How the hell are you?

12:26.959 --> 12:30.041
So, listen, you know I have
this little show, right?

12:30.041 --> 12:31.750
I was wondering...

12:32.542 --> 12:34.875
Who said you're not
the first one I called?

12:35.583 --> 12:37.083
Schwimmer's an asshole!

12:37.792 --> 12:39.709
I never said
you were an asshole.

12:40.291 --> 12:41.959
No, I did not!

12:42.417 --> 12:43.875
I did not.

12:44.458 --> 12:46.750
I don't know,
he was probably high.

12:46.750 --> 12:53.208
If I said you were high,
I was obviously kidding.
It was a joke.

12:56.667 --> 12:58.875
So you and Schwimmer
still talk a lot.

13:02.417 --> 13:04.917
Um... Carol from
the network called.

13:05.208 --> 13:06.291
Which one's Carol?

13:06.291 --> 13:09.709
(SIGHS) The one you always
say, "which one's Carol?"

13:09.709 --> 13:12.250
She's right under Merc.
Also literally.

13:12.250 --> 13:13.667
Oh, right.

13:13.667 --> 13:16.875
She was asking where
you are on the  Friends
guest-star thing.

13:16.875 --> 13:19.792
(SIGHS) Jesus.
I'm working on it.

13:19.792 --> 13:23.917
All right, well, she just
needs to know so they can
get started on promotion.

13:23.917 --> 13:27.625
Right, well, tell Carol
she'll be the first to hear.

13:27.625 --> 13:30.291
Till then she can just
back the fuck off.

13:30.625 --> 13:31.959
I may paraphrase.

13:31.959 --> 13:33.083
Mmm. Mmm.

13:42.625 --> 13:44.083
Is it diminishing at all?

13:46.625 --> 13:47.625
Do you need
more teeth?

13:54.291 --> 13:55.959
(CLEARS THROAT) Fuck!

13:57.250 --> 13:58.667
Anyway, I need a favor.

13:58.667 --> 14:01.834
I have to present this
stupid award thing to Merc.

14:01.834 --> 14:03.500
Right. We just
got the invitation.

14:03.500 --> 14:04.667
We don't have
to go to that, do we?

14:04.667 --> 14:06.834
Probably.
It's a good cause.

14:06.834 --> 14:08.500
Which is?
Some opera bullshit.

14:08.500 --> 14:09.875
Ah.

14:10.125 --> 14:13.166
Anyway, I was wondering
if you guys could write me
a little something to say.

14:13.166 --> 14:15.792
Just some crap about
Merc for when I present it.

14:15.792 --> 14:18.208
Uh, I suppose.
It's not really
what we do.

14:18.208 --> 14:22.083
Are you kidding me?
You guys'll knock it
out in two seconds.

14:22.083 --> 14:25.333
It just needs to be funny.
Throw in some bald jokes.

14:25.333 --> 14:27.667
Whatever you come up
with, it'll be great.
You guys are amazing.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.250
When do you need it?

14:29.250 --> 14:32.834
Sooner the better. You know,
in case I don't like it,
you can take another pass.

14:36.667 --> 14:40.375
Hey, so I hear we're
getting one of the
Friends on the show?

14:41.250 --> 14:42.291
Yup.

14:42.291 --> 14:43.166
Awesome.

14:43.792 --> 14:45.166
Very cool, man.

14:45.166 --> 14:48.208
I can't believe we're
gonna be working with
one of the Friends!

14:51.375 --> 14:53.083
Hi, it's Matt LeBlanc
for Jennifer.

14:55.208 --> 14:56.500
Oh, okay.

14:57.542 --> 15:00.792
Yeah, I just tried her cell
and it doesn't seem to be
in service anymore.

15:00.792 --> 15:02.542
Can you give me
the new number?

15:02.875 --> 15:05.083
I'm sure she'd
be fine with it.

15:06.709 --> 15:10.041
She gave me the old one,
why wouldn't she want me to...

15:10.542 --> 15:12.166
Is Alison there?

15:14.041 --> 15:16.041
Oh, when did she leave?

15:18.333 --> 15:19.709
Have we met?

15:21.083 --> 15:22.417
Well, hello.

15:23.458 --> 15:25.125
Yeah, I can hold.

15:28.083 --> 15:29.375
Oh, shall we get
some dinner in?

15:29.375 --> 15:31.250
Nah. We can blow
through this.

15:31.250 --> 15:32.333
Okay.

15:32.333 --> 15:34.667
So, they introduce Matt,
he comes up on stage...

15:34.667 --> 15:35.875
Applause, applause,
applause...

15:35.875 --> 15:36.834
Right.

15:36.834 --> 15:38.417
Then how about
something like,

15:38.417 --> 15:44.792
"When I was first asked
to present this award
to our Man of the Year,

15:44.792 --> 15:46.542
"I thought..."

15:51.750 --> 15:52.750
What?
You thought what?

15:52.750 --> 15:54.875
That's all I've got.
Ah.

15:56.250 --> 15:58.333
He should
probably start off
with something funny.

15:58.333 --> 16:00.083
Definitely.
Mmm-hmm.

16:10.458 --> 16:11.709
What are you thinking?

16:11.709 --> 16:12.917
Pizza or Thai?
Thai.

16:12.917 --> 16:14.000
Hmm.

16:14.834 --> 16:16.625
Matt comes out...
Applause, applause,
applause...

16:16.625 --> 16:19.166
You know, you don't have
to say "applause, applause,
applause" each time.

16:19.166 --> 16:20.583
Okay.
Clap, clap, clap.

16:20.583 --> 16:24.667
Maybe Matt goes, "What can
I say about my good friend
Merc Lapidus?"

16:24.667 --> 16:25.834
What can he say?

16:25.834 --> 16:27.458
I don't know,
he's not our
good friend.

16:27.458 --> 16:28.291
(SCOFFING) No.

16:28.291 --> 16:29.750
(SIGHS)

16:30.625 --> 16:33.125
All right, what do
we know about him?

16:33.125 --> 16:35.875
Well, he's lied
to us repeatedly.
Yeah.

16:35.875 --> 16:38.792
He destroyed
our TV show.
Absolutely.

16:38.792 --> 16:40.583
He's cheating on his wife.
Yeah.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.959
Ooh, he's only
got one testicle.

16:48.834 --> 16:49.875
Does he?

16:49.875 --> 16:51.125
Carol told me.

16:54.750 --> 16:56.500
MATT: Look, Courteney,
I understand.

16:56.500 --> 16:59.667
If you can't do it,
you can't do it.
Don't worry about it.

16:59.667 --> 17:03.208
But while I got you,
can you give me
Jen's number?

17:06.709 --> 17:09.041
Why wouldn't she
want to talk to me?

17:10.458 --> 17:12.959
It was funny!
People laughed.

17:15.083 --> 17:18.000
I so did not pee
on her Emmy.

17:19.250 --> 17:21.458
Because I would
never do that.

17:22.750 --> 17:26.000
Yeah, I pulled it out,
but I never peed.

17:27.041 --> 17:28.041
Never.

17:28.709 --> 17:30.000
Never.

17:33.000 --> 17:38.000
Well, if I dribbled,
I'm sorry. But, come on,
it was 10 years ago.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.333
You really won't
give me her number?

17:41.875 --> 17:43.083
Seriously?

17:44.917 --> 17:46.583
You really won't?

17:48.375 --> 17:50.667
(SCOFFS) Fuck you.

17:50.667 --> 17:53.166
No, I did not
just say "fuck you."

17:57.959 --> 17:59.917
SEAN: All right,
how's this?

17:59.917 --> 18:02.166
"Being a network president
requires many things.

18:02.166 --> 18:04.291
"You need passion.
You need perception.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.083
"But apparently,
you don't need hair."

18:06.083 --> 18:07.250
(LAUGHING)

18:07.250 --> 18:09.083
That's good. I like it.
Let's do it.

18:09.083 --> 18:10.875
Are you saying that just
so we can get out of here?

18:10.875 --> 18:12.625
I want to go home!

18:12.625 --> 18:13.917
You think I don't?

18:13.917 --> 18:15.667
We don't know how
to write this shit.
It's not what we do.

18:15.667 --> 18:16.750
I know that!

18:16.750 --> 18:18.125
Don't yell at me!

18:18.125 --> 18:19.542
Why did we agree
to do this?

18:19.542 --> 18:20.917
Why do we agree
to do anything?

18:20.917 --> 18:24.291
I hate us! I hate Matt!
I hate Merc!

18:24.291 --> 18:27.291
(SIGHS) Why are we doing
this without alcohol?

18:28.125 --> 18:29.917
What makes you think
he has a bottle here?

18:29.917 --> 18:32.208
Oh, believe me,
Jerry drinks.

18:32.959 --> 18:34.333
You know this
for a fact?

18:34.333 --> 18:35.750
Sometimes he's drunk
in the room.

18:36.375 --> 18:38.417
One of our writers
is drunk in
our writers' room?

18:38.417 --> 18:40.333
You've never noticed?
No.

18:40.333 --> 18:41.667
And you're okay
with this?

18:41.667 --> 18:43.125
It's the only
time he's funny.

18:43.792 --> 18:46.166
(GASPS)
Bloody bastard!

18:46.166 --> 18:47.208
What?

18:47.208 --> 18:48.834
He stole my pen.
No.

18:48.834 --> 18:50.375
This is my pen.
Are you sure?

18:50.375 --> 18:54.291
Yeah, I'm sure.
I've been looking for it.
This really pisses me off.

18:54.291 --> 18:56.208
But you're okay with him
being an alcoholic?

18:56.208 --> 18:57.125
We need the jokes.

18:58.709 --> 19:00.500
It's nice. Is it new?

19:00.500 --> 19:01.625
Uh...

19:01.625 --> 19:04.291
"Y.C.O.M.T."

19:06.792 --> 19:08.667
Oh, it says that?
Hmm.

19:08.667 --> 19:13.166
Ha! Guess it's not mine.
Sorry, Jerry!

19:15.291 --> 19:18.166
Hello!
There we go.

19:18.166 --> 19:19.291
This is expensive.

19:19.291 --> 19:21.083
You're thinking
we shouldn't take it?

19:21.083 --> 19:24.750
I'm thinking, if I'd known
he had this, I would have
been in here a long time ago.

19:40.500 --> 19:41.750
(CLEARS THROAT)

19:41.750 --> 19:43.792
How's your mother?
Wow.

19:43.792 --> 19:45.667
That wasn't
random at all.

19:45.667 --> 19:49.959
I was just remembering, when
we were trying to write that
song for their anniversary,

19:49.959 --> 19:51.041
and how hard it was.

19:51.041 --> 19:52.417
Oh, God, right.

19:52.417 --> 19:54.458
And how we sang it
at the party,

19:54.458 --> 19:57.959
and she kept looking at me
with those "fuck you" eyes.

19:57.959 --> 20:01.000
Oh! She hated me.
No.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.375
Well...

20:04.333 --> 20:07.333
She always blamed me
for splitting up you
and Emmeline.

20:07.667 --> 20:11.000
BOTH: (IN SING-SONG)
Emmeline!

20:11.583 --> 20:12.709
You did split us up.

20:12.709 --> 20:13.667
What?

20:13.667 --> 20:16.166
For which I am
eternally grateful.

20:21.375 --> 20:23.709
She must be loving
what's happened to us now.

20:23.709 --> 20:27.750
(CLICKS TONGUE)
She probably would...

20:27.750 --> 20:29.417
If I'd told her.

20:29.750 --> 20:30.792
What?

20:30.792 --> 20:33.333
As far as she knows,
we're still together.

20:34.375 --> 20:35.333
You did not!

20:35.333 --> 20:37.709
I wasn't about to give her
the satisfaction.

20:37.709 --> 20:38.792
(LAUGHS)

20:39.375 --> 20:40.959
Doesn't she wonder
where I am?

20:40.959 --> 20:45.166
No, of course she doesn't.
That would mean
I'd have to exist.

20:49.333 --> 20:52.291
BOTH: (IN SING-SONG)
Emmeline!

20:58.125 --> 20:59.458
So...

21:02.000 --> 21:04.792
You and Morning...
Always a fun topic.

21:05.250 --> 21:07.125
Was it everything
you'd hoped it'd be?

21:07.125 --> 21:08.917
I'm not going
near that question.

21:08.917 --> 21:11.000
Oh, come on.

21:11.000 --> 21:16.959
I'm imagining it was
like driving some amazing
German-built sports car.

21:16.959 --> 21:19.625
You're very aware of all
the engineers and mechanics

21:19.625 --> 21:23.333
who've devoted themselves
to creating
this one perfect machine.

21:23.333 --> 21:26.625
Hmm. That and a vagina,
and you've pretty much
got it.

21:34.125 --> 21:35.208
So was it
just that once?

21:35.208 --> 21:37.125
Yeah... No!

21:37.500 --> 21:38.583
No?
Twice.

21:39.458 --> 21:40.709
Twice.

21:41.333 --> 21:44.125
And which time would
you say was better?

21:45.458 --> 21:46.458
Why?

21:47.000 --> 21:48.792
I'd like to think
it was going downhill.

21:48.792 --> 21:50.500
Definitely downhill.

21:51.667 --> 21:52.709
Good.

21:53.333 --> 21:55.291
In fact,
the second time...

21:56.625 --> 21:58.125
No.

21:58.125 --> 22:00.625
Go on!
The second time...
No...

22:01.750 --> 22:08.166
The second time
was right after her
whole cheek debacle.

22:08.166 --> 22:10.458
No! Oh!

22:10.458 --> 22:14.792
She was convinced she was
going to be fired.
I assured her she wasn't.

22:14.792 --> 22:19.000
She was grateful.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.250
This is horrible.

22:20.250 --> 22:22.542
I resisted.
So strong.

22:22.542 --> 22:25.208
She was persistent.
(SCOFFS)
What could you do?

22:25.208 --> 22:27.542
Eventually, she...

22:31.041 --> 22:32.458
Thanked you?
Yeah.

22:33.333 --> 22:35.458
Orally?
Might have been.

22:36.667 --> 22:39.375
What a romantic story!

22:59.000 --> 23:00.667
So how about you?

23:02.041 --> 23:03.583
How about me what?

23:03.583 --> 23:07.166
Have you been "driving"
anything lately?

23:07.583 --> 23:08.875
No!

23:08.875 --> 23:10.500
Really? No one?

23:12.542 --> 23:14.166
No.
All this time?

23:15.542 --> 23:19.250
I've been saving myself
for you, don't you know.

23:30.542 --> 23:31.917
If you don't
kiss me soon...

23:32.875 --> 23:34.250
I'm thinking about it.

23:34.250 --> 23:35.333
Do it.

23:35.333 --> 23:36.375
Bossy.

23:37.542 --> 23:39.625
You like it bossy.
I do.

24:01.583 --> 24:03.709
I've missed you,
you fucker.

24:06.083 --> 24:07.709
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

24:13.166 --> 24:15.625
I don't know whether to savor
every moment or just
bash right through...

24:15.625 --> 24:16.959
I say bash!

24:40.333 --> 24:41.667
(MOANS)

24:46.959 --> 24:48.625
(BOTH GASPING)

25:03.291 --> 25:05.041
What?
What's the matter?

25:08.125 --> 25:10.667
I keep seeing
you with him.

25:10.667 --> 25:11.625
No.

25:14.500 --> 25:17.667
I thought I could...
I thought I could...

25:17.667 --> 25:21.375
But I can't stop
picturing you...

25:22.875 --> 25:26.667
The two of you, in his bed.
Him, with all of his enormity.

25:26.667 --> 25:29.333
It's not that big.
I've seen it!

25:29.333 --> 25:32.792
Unless it's one of
those very special penises
that gets much, much smaller

25:32.792 --> 25:34.667
when it gets erect.

25:34.667 --> 25:38.417
Oh, my God, who cares?
It doesn't matter.

25:38.417 --> 25:41.166
Well, it clearly
matters to me.

25:46.875 --> 25:48.166
I'm sorry.

25:49.709 --> 25:53.583
I love you,
you know that.
But I can't...

25:57.291 --> 25:59.041
I can't do
this anymore.

26:25.208 --> 26:27.917
CAROL: Great, you guys.
Thanks again for coming in.

26:27.917 --> 26:28.959
(CHUCKLES)

26:28.959 --> 26:30.250
(DOOR SHUTS)

26:30.250 --> 26:31.583
Yeah...
I don't think so.

26:31.583 --> 26:34.250
What? I think
it could be fun.
Come on.

26:34.250 --> 26:35.917
A show about
three little ghosts?

26:35.917 --> 26:38.166
It's a show about
dead children.

26:38.166 --> 26:39.875
Well, I wouldn't put
that in the promos.

26:39.875 --> 26:43.500
Ooh! Speaking of promos,
where are we with  Pucks!
and the  Friends
thing?

26:43.500 --> 26:45.083
They're shooting it today.
Today?

26:45.083 --> 26:47.959
Keep me in the loop,
why don't you?
Which one did we get?

26:47.959 --> 26:49.542
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
On a bell.

26:49.542 --> 26:51.083
MAN:
Speeding...
(BELL RINGING)

26:51.083 --> 26:52.208
Action!

26:56.083 --> 26:58.750
You actually think
your team can beat us?

26:58.750 --> 27:01.458
Your guys suck so
much you should be
called the Hoovers!

27:01.458 --> 27:02.583
Yeah!

27:05.000 --> 27:07.959
Seriously, Lyman?
Is that the best
you've got?

27:09.333 --> 27:11.083
Yeah. It is. Yea

27:14.125 --> 27:15.166
DIRECTOR: Cut!

27:17.125 --> 27:18.792
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
Moving on!

27:20.667 --> 27:22.500
Hey, man, thanks
for doing this.

27:22.500 --> 27:23.625
Hey, thanks
for having me.

27:23.625 --> 27:25.291
Really great
to see you again.

27:25.291 --> 27:26.625
Yeah.
You, too, man.

27:26.625 --> 27:28.250
You know, you're like,
the only one I don't
keep in touch with.

27:28.250 --> 27:29.834
Seriously?
Yeah.

27:29.834 --> 27:32.875
I still see Schwimmer.
Courteney and I text
all the time.

27:32.875 --> 27:34.417
Thanks.
Really?

27:34.959 --> 27:36.208
Jen, too?

27:36.208 --> 27:39.166
Yeah. I housesit
for her when
she's in New York.

27:39.166 --> 27:42.583
Huh! Hey, you don't happen
to have her cell number,
do you?

27:43.333 --> 27:44.458
Um...

27:45.709 --> 27:48.667
You know, I gotta say,
I feel a little uncomfortable
giving it to you...

27:48.667 --> 27:49.834
Fuck you!
