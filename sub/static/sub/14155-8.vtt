FOR BEING MEAN TO AARON.

HANDLED IT BETTER,

ACTUALLY,
YOU WERE JUST BRUTAL.

36:37.967 --> 36:41.400
NO, I WASN'T. I SAID TO HIM
OVER AND OVER, IT'S JUST SEX.

HAVE DIFFERENT EXPECTATIONS

36:43.833 --> 36:45.367
ABOUT HOW
RELATIONSHIPS WORK.

36:45.367 --> 36:47.300
LIKE VINCENT.
HE'S GOT THIS PHILOSOPHY

36:47.300 --> 36:48.500
THAT GAY RELATIONSHIPS

36:48.500 --> 36:50.700
DON'T HAVE TO MIMIC
STRAIGHT RELATIONSHIPS.

GET MARRIED LIKE THEM,

DATE LIKE THEM?

36:58.567 --> 37:01.200
WE CAN SEE OTHER PEOPLE
AND STILL BE A COUPLE.

BELIEVE IN MONOGAMY.

37:11.067 --> 37:12.167
AT LEAST HE'S HONEST.

37:12.167 --> 37:15.133

THE KEYS TO THE CASTLE.

SO WHY ARE YOU SLUMMING
OVER HERE WITH ME?

38:39.833 --> 38:41.667
BECAUSE I CAN'T BECOME
PREDICTABLE.

38:41.667 --> 38:44.833
HE SHOULD NEVER KNOW EXACTLY
WHEN I'M COMING OR GOING.

WHAT'S FASCINATING
IS THAT I GOT MY CASTLE,

WOULD JUST MAKE IT COMPLICATED.

I'LL GET THERE IN AN HOUR,
