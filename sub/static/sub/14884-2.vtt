WEBVTT

00:08.108 --> 00:09.041
>> SCOTT: Kylie?                

00:09.109 --> 00:10.042
>> KYLIE: I'm gonna do my       

00:10.110 --> 00:11.043
lipstick.                       

00:11.111 --> 00:12.044
>> SCOTT: Get it up there.      

00:12.112 --> 00:13.045
You should want your nose to    

00:13.113 --> 00:14.079
almost hit your lip, like...    

00:14.147 --> 00:15.080
>> KYLIE: That's what I think.  

00:15.148 --> 00:16.081
>> SCOTT: There you go!         

00:16.149 --> 00:17.416
Plump her up!                   

00:17.484 --> 00:18.417
You should go to the mall, go to

00:18.485 --> 00:19.685
Courrier and get one more       

00:19.753 --> 00:20.853
bracelet.                       

00:20.920 --> 00:21.954
>> KYLIE: My mother says to keep

00:22.022 --> 00:23.155
it uneven, so I'm at seven now. 

00:23.223 --> 00:24.289
>> SCOTT: Your mother's going   

00:24.357 --> 00:25.290
through a lot of stuff.         

00:25.358 --> 00:26.291
She's, like, newly single.      

00:26.359 --> 00:27.292
We got to get her in the playing

00:27.360 --> 00:28.293
field.                          

00:28.361 --> 00:29.294
>> KYLIE: Yeah.                 

00:29.362 --> 00:30.295
>> SCOTT: I just don't know what

00:30.363 --> 00:31.296
kind of man she expects or is   

00:31.364 --> 00:32.698
gonna want, at this point.      

00:32.766 --> 00:34.466
Definitely African-American.    

00:34.534 --> 00:35.467
>> KYLIE: I don't think         

00:35.535 --> 00:36.969
African-American.               

00:37.037 --> 00:38.170
>> SCOTT: 100%.                 

00:38.238 --> 00:39.538
Good looking, semi-funny, same  

00:39.606 --> 00:40.539
age, all right.                 

00:40.607 --> 00:41.540
>> KYLIE: I think same age, but 

00:41.608 --> 00:42.541
I don't think she thinks        

00:42.609 --> 00:43.542
same age.                       

00:43.610 --> 00:44.209
>> SCOTT: But she thinks        

00:44.277 --> 00:45.210
"same age" is, like, 40.        

00:45.278 --> 00:45.878
>> KYLIE: Yeah.                 

00:45.945 --> 00:46.879
>> SCOTT: And she's not really  

00:46.946 --> 00:47.880
40... she's older than that.    

00:47.947 --> 00:48.881
>> KYLIE: She's definitely      

00:48.948 --> 00:49.548
a cougar.                       

00:49.616 --> 00:50.549
>> SCOTT: She's definitely      

00:50.617 --> 00:51.216
a "coug."                       

00:51.284 --> 00:52.217
>> KYLIE: I don't want her to   

00:52.285 --> 00:53.218
know that I'm, like, talking    

00:53.286 --> 00:53.886
to you about it.                

00:53.953 --> 00:54.887
>> SCOTT: It makes sense, it is 

00:54.954 --> 00:55.554
a bit weird for you.            

00:55.622 --> 00:56.555
I just feel like you're so grown

00:56.623 --> 00:57.556
up... even though you're younger

00:57.624 --> 00:58.791
than you look.                  

00:58.858 --> 01:00.025
>> KYLIE: Younger than I look?  

01:00.093 --> 01:01.593
>> SCOTT: How old are you? 17.  

01:01.661 --> 01:02.761
What do you look like? 25.      

01:02.829 --> 01:03.962
>> KYLIE: 25, you think?        

01:04.030 --> 01:04.962
>> SCOTT: Should I date your    

01:05.031 --> 01:06.131
mom?                            

01:06.199 --> 01:07.166
>> KYLIE: Probably.             

01:07.233 --> 01:08.167
That seems like definitely where

01:08.234 --> 01:09.368
this conversation is heading.   

01:09.436 --> 01:10.669
>> SCOTT: I just feel like that 

01:10.737 --> 01:12.004
may make more sense.            

01:12.072 --> 01:13.339
>> KYLIE: For sure. Younger...  

01:13.406 --> 01:14.673
>> SCOTT: Boy toy.              

01:14.741 --> 01:15.874
>> KYLIE: Yeah.                 

01:15.942 --> 01:16.942
>> SCOTT: Who can we hook       

01:17.010 --> 01:18.010
Kourtney up with?               

01:18.078 --> 01:19.978
(Kylie laughs)

01:29.089 --> 01:30.022
>> NICCOLO: It's been too long. 

01:30.090 --> 01:31.023
>> KIM: Hi! How are you.        

01:31.091 --> 01:32.024
>> NICCOLO: Great to see you.   

01:32.092 --> 01:32.691
Thank you for coming.           

01:32.759 --> 01:33.692
>> KIM: I love that-- did you   

01:33.760 --> 01:34.693
put that up just for today?     

01:34.761 --> 01:35.694
>> NICCOLO: Uh, no, believe it  

01:35.762 --> 01:36.695
or not, that's there all the    

01:36.763 --> 01:37.696
time.                           

01:37.764 --> 01:38.697
>> KIM: Cool!                   

01:38.765 --> 01:39.698
>> NICCOLO: And then we have the

01:39.766 --> 01:40.766
whole board room set up to talk 

01:40.834 --> 01:42.101
through what we're gonna do with

01:42.168 --> 01:43.435
the game in the next few months.

01:43.503 --> 01:44.603
>> KIM: Oh, my God!             

01:44.671 --> 01:45.804
Those are so cute!              

01:45.872 --> 01:47.373
I'm in San Francisco meeting    

01:47.440 --> 01:49.008
with my whole Glu team to talk  

01:49.075 --> 01:50.609
about new updates for my app.   

01:50.677 --> 01:52.111
It's called <i> Kim Kardashian</i>      

01:52.178 --> 01:53.479
<i>Hollywood.</i>                      

01:53.546 --> 01:54.880
It's this fun app where you kind

01:54.948 --> 01:56.982
of want to make it in Hollywood.

01:57.050 --> 01:58.684
And I just love being of it and 

01:58.752 --> 02:00.452
coming up with really fun,      

02:00.520 --> 02:01.754
creative ideas.                 

02:01.821 --> 02:03.489
>> NICCOLO: So, you remember a  

02:03.556 --> 02:05.357
couple months ago, we were      

02:05.425 --> 02:06.625
talking through Bono's AIDS     

02:06.693 --> 02:07.626
charity.                        

02:07.694 --> 02:08.627
>> KIM: Mm-hmm.                 

02:08.695 --> 02:09.627
>> NICCOLO: And we had this     

02:09.696 --> 02:10.795
brainstorm with you over, co... 

02:10.864 --> 02:12.164
you know, could this game be    

02:12.232 --> 02:13.432
part of the next Red campaign?  

02:13.500 --> 02:14.933
We are giving away all of the   

02:15.001 --> 02:16.402
proceeds to from certain Red    

02:16.469 --> 02:17.403
items.                          

02:17.470 --> 02:18.303
Your mom, I'm sure,is gonna     

02:18.371 --> 02:19.171
make it in for this update,     

02:19.239 --> 02:20.205
as well.                        

02:20.273 --> 02:21.306
>> KIM: She looks amazing.      

02:21.374 --> 02:22.641
I love her character.           

02:22.709 --> 02:23.809
>> NICCOLO: Well, so, Kim, let's

02:23.877 --> 02:25.010
talk about whether or not we can

02:25.078 --> 02:26.412
talk your, your sisters into,   

02:26.479 --> 02:28.514
uh, into joining the party.     

02:28.581 --> 02:30.082
And I actually think that we'll 

02:30.150 --> 02:31.517
expand the fan base with that.  

02:31.584 --> 02:32.885
>> KIM: Yeah.                   

02:32.952 --> 02:34.153
>> NICCOLO: Assuring that we    

02:34.220 --> 02:35.220
have the biggest fan base, the  

02:35.288 --> 02:36.522
only game that does this and I  

02:36.589 --> 02:37.990
really appreciate, uh, you      

02:38.058 --> 02:39.158
going to bat for us.            

02:39.225 --> 02:40.426
>> KIM: Khloe would love to.    

02:40.493 --> 02:41.627
Kourtney is just always         

02:41.695 --> 02:42.895
difficult.                      

02:42.962 --> 02:44.063
But I want her to be in it,     

02:44.130 --> 02:45.297
'cause she's my sister.         

02:45.365 --> 02:46.298
>> NICCOLO: I think that's a    

02:46.366 --> 02:47.299
powerful picture, uh...         

02:47.367 --> 02:48.300
>> KIM: I do, too.              

02:48.368 --> 02:49.301
I love that.                    

02:49.369 --> 02:50.903
I really want to add my family  

02:50.970 --> 02:52.338
members to the game because a   

02:52.405 --> 02:54.273
game is supposed to mirror my   

02:54.341 --> 02:56.608
real life, so I think it's just 

02:56.676 --> 02:58.577
a fun way to add more characters

02:58.645 --> 03:00.245
and I'm always with them.       

03:00.313 --> 03:01.246
I think it could just be cute   

03:01.314 --> 03:02.247
and fun.                        

03:02.315 --> 03:03.248
Are any of the people that work 

03:03.316 --> 03:03.916
on my game here?                

03:03.983 --> 03:04.917
>> NICCOLO: Absolutely.         

03:04.984 --> 03:05.584
Absolutely.                     

03:05.652 --> 03:06.585
>> KIM: I-I'd like to meet them.

03:06.653 --> 03:07.419
>> NICCOLO: There's lots of     

03:07.487 --> 03:08.020
people here.                    

03:08.088 --> 03:08.520
Lots of people here.            

03:08.588 --> 03:09.321
>> MAN: We'd love to do a       

03:09.389 --> 03:10.255
champagne and cupcake toast out 

03:10.323 --> 03:11.256
there, if you don't mind.       

03:11.324 --> 03:12.257
>> KIM: I would love to, yeah.  

03:12.325 --> 03:14.226
(group cheering, applauding)    

03:18.098 --> 03:19.064
Thank you. I just want to thank 

03:19.132 --> 03:21.166
everyone that works on the game 

03:21.234 --> 03:24.003
and for pushing yourselves and  

03:24.070 --> 03:25.504
being inspired and I haven't    

03:25.572 --> 03:27.806
seen a response from my fan base

03:27.874 --> 03:30.342
on a game that they've really   

03:30.410 --> 03:32.678
liked like this in a long time. 

03:32.746 --> 03:34.079
So, it's because of, really, all

03:34.147 --> 03:35.214
of you guys, so thank you.      

03:35.281 --> 03:36.215
>> NICCOLO: The feeling's       

03:36.282 --> 03:37.216
mutual.                         

03:37.283 --> 03:38.283
(group cheering, applauding)    

03:38.351 --> 03:39.284
>> KIM: I'm gonna stay away from

03:39.352 --> 03:40.619
those cupcakes.                 

03:40.687 --> 03:42.588
(everyone laughs)               

03:45.859 --> 03:47.393
>> SCOTT: Hey, Kyles.           

03:47.460 --> 03:48.460
The Puerto Rican mama.          

03:48.528 --> 03:49.595
>> KENDALL: Ah, my old bed!     

03:49.662 --> 03:50.596
>> SCOTT: Have you seen her do  

03:50.663 --> 03:51.597
her lipstick?                   

03:51.664 --> 03:52.664
>> KENDALL: Oh, it's crazy.     

03:52.732 --> 03:53.866
>> SCOTT: It takes, like, 40    

03:53.933 --> 03:54.867
minutes, and then there's, like,

03:54.934 --> 03:55.868
she, like, pulls one lip, pushes

03:55.935 --> 03:56.869
one out...                      

03:56.936 --> 03:57.936
>> KENDALL: Ew! That's not cute!

03:58.004 --> 03:58.937
>> SCOTT: Yeah, I don't         

03:59.005 --> 03:59.938
understand why everybody thinks 

04:00.006 --> 04:00.939
it's so cute to, like, duck it  

04:01.007 --> 04:01.940
out...                          

04:02.008 --> 04:02.941
>> KENDALL: Ew! Kylie, stop!    

04:03.009 --> 04:03.942
>> SCOTT: Yeah, that's sick!    

04:04.010 --> 04:04.610
>> KENDALL: You look like       

04:04.678 --> 04:05.611
a worm!                         

04:05.679 --> 04:06.612
>> SCOTT: I'm trying to fill    

04:06.680 --> 04:07.613
Kenny in on her mom.            

04:07.681 --> 04:08.614
>> KYLIE: I think she's texting 

04:08.682 --> 04:09.615
someone.                        

04:09.683 --> 04:10.282
>> SCOTT: A guy?                

04:10.350 --> 04:11.283
>> KYLIE: A guy.                

04:11.351 --> 04:11.950
>> SCOTT: Wow.                  

04:12.018 --> 04:12.951
>> KENDALL: Oh, this freaks me  

04:13.019 --> 04:13.952
out, though, you guys.          

04:14.020 --> 04:14.953
Thinking of her, like, flirting 

04:15.021 --> 04:15.954
with someone.                   

04:16.022 --> 04:16.988
>> KYLIE: I just see my mom     

04:17.057 --> 04:18.457
giggling and laughing at her    

04:18.524 --> 04:19.757
phone and I think...            

04:19.826 --> 04:21.125
>> SCOTT: She's sexting?        

04:21.194 --> 04:22.127
>> KENDALL: I think we have to  

04:22.195 --> 04:23.295
go steal her phone.             

04:23.363 --> 04:24.296
>> SCOTT: Uh, I'm gonna go grab 

04:24.364 --> 04:25.931
it.                             

04:25.999 --> 04:27.299
It must be very difficult to    

04:27.367 --> 04:28.934
jump back into the dating world 

04:29.002 --> 04:31.170
23 years later, but if she's    

04:31.237 --> 04:33.472
sexting with other guys, it's   

04:33.540 --> 04:35.908
very odd because, 20 years ago, 

04:35.975 --> 04:37.042
I don't think you were getting  

04:37.110 --> 04:38.043
laid over text messages.        

04:38.111 --> 04:39.044
Hello!                          

04:39.112 --> 04:40.045
>> KRIS: Hey.                   

04:40.113 --> 04:41.046
>> SCOTT: Can I use your phone? 

04:41.114 --> 04:42.047
My phone died.                  

04:42.115 --> 04:42.715
>> KRIS: You want to use        

04:42.782 --> 04:43.716
my phone?                       

04:43.783 --> 04:44.383
>> SCOTT: But I want to text    

04:44.451 --> 04:45.384
Kourt, so I can't use           

04:45.452 --> 04:46.051
the house line.                 

04:46.119 --> 04:47.052
>> KRIS: Okay.                  

04:47.120 --> 04:47.720
>> SCOTT: Thank you.            

04:47.787 --> 04:48.721
>> KRIS: All right.             

04:48.788 --> 04:49.388
There you go.                   

04:49.456 --> 04:50.389
>> SCOTT: Thanks. I'll be just  

04:50.457 --> 04:51.557
right here in your room.        

04:51.624 --> 04:53.025
(laughing): Oh, man!            

04:53.093 --> 04:54.593
I scrolled for a second... wait.

04:54.661 --> 04:56.762
Look at this (bleep) guy.       

04:56.830 --> 04:58.731
"Hello back, Kris.              

04:58.798 --> 05:00.032
Nice meeting you last night."   

05:00.100 --> 05:01.033
I don't know who's who.         

05:01.101 --> 05:02.034
>> KYLIE: Is this really real?  

05:02.102 --> 05:03.035
>> SCOTT: This is... No, this is

05:03.103 --> 05:04.036
real.                           

05:04.104 --> 05:05.170
I don't know if Kris googled    

05:05.238 --> 05:06.605
"how to be sexy over texts," but

05:06.673 --> 05:08.140
she's doing it.                 

05:08.208 --> 05:09.074
>> KENDALL: He sends her, like, 

05:09.142 --> 05:09.808
selfies on selfies.             

05:09.876 --> 05:10.576
Look at him.                    

05:10.643 --> 05:11.377
(Scott snickering)              

05:11.444 --> 05:12.811
>> SCOTT: And it's inappropriate

05:12.879 --> 05:14.747
and it's very uncomfortable.    

05:14.814 --> 05:15.748
>> KENDALL: Kylie, stop! Please!

05:15.815 --> 05:16.749
>> SCOTT: Oh, no, no, no.       

05:16.816 --> 05:17.750
>> KENDALL: You're freaking me  

05:17.817 --> 05:18.751
out!                            

05:18.818 --> 05:19.752
>> SCOTT: Wait, oh, no.         

05:19.819 --> 05:20.753
Did we just get proper (bleep)? 

05:20.820 --> 05:21.754
>> KRIS: What? What are you guys

05:21.821 --> 05:22.755
doing?                          

05:22.822 --> 05:23.756
>> SCOTT: Who's Corey?          

05:23.823 --> 05:24.757
>> KRIS: What are you guys      

05:24.824 --> 05:25.758
doing? What are you guys doing  

05:25.825 --> 05:26.425
doing with my phone?            

05:26.493 --> 05:27.426
>> SCOTT: What do you mean?     

05:27.494 --> 05:27.993
I was texting...                

05:28.061 --> 05:28.761
>> KRIS: What are you doing?    

05:28.828 --> 05:29.628
You were supposed to text       

05:29.696 --> 05:30.162
Kourtney.                       

05:30.230 --> 05:31.263
>> SCOTT: I did and then I just 

05:31.331 --> 05:32.297
fell into all these             

05:32.365 --> 05:33.699
conversations you were having   

05:33.767 --> 05:35.000
with 20-year-old men and...     

05:35.068 --> 05:36.935
>> KRIS: Give me my phone!      

05:37.003 --> 05:37.936
>> KYLIE: Mom, if I open it...  

05:38.004 --> 05:38.937
>> KRIS: Give me, give me the   

05:39.005 --> 05:39.938
phone!                          

05:40.006 --> 05:40.939
>> SCOTT: Kris?                 

05:41.007 --> 05:41.940
>> KRIS: Hmm?                   

05:42.008 --> 05:42.941
>> SCOTT: Who's Corey?          

05:43.009 --> 05:43.942
>> KENDALL: Oh, no.             

05:44.010 --> 05:44.943
>> KRIS: My... Just stop!       

05:45.011 --> 05:45.944
>> SCOTT: Oh, I had no idea I   

05:46.012 --> 05:46.945
was hitting a trigger.          

05:47.013 --> 05:48.113
I don't know who this is.       

05:48.181 --> 05:49.114
>> KRIS: Stop!                  

05:49.182 --> 05:51.016
Why are you doing this to me?   

05:51.084 --> 05:52.985
(all laugh)                     

05:57.223 --> 05:58.457
>> LISA: These are the two      

05:58.525 --> 05:59.591
prints we're thinking about.    

05:59.659 --> 06:01.126
Either a larger scale one or a  

06:01.194 --> 06:02.127
small scale one.                

06:02.195 --> 06:03.128
>> KOURTNEY: I think that       

06:03.196 --> 06:04.129
sweatshirt is more girly than   

06:04.197 --> 06:05.130
that one.                       

06:05.198 --> 06:06.331
>> KIM: Yeah.                   

06:06.399 --> 06:07.366
>> KOURTNEY: I like this, but   

06:07.434 --> 06:08.367
maybe for a boy.                

06:08.435 --> 06:09.401
>> BRUNO: Okay, cool.           

06:09.469 --> 06:10.402
>> LISA: Okay, good, so we'll   

06:10.470 --> 06:11.403
start working on that.          

06:11.471 --> 06:12.404
>> KOURTNEY: Okay.              

06:12.472 --> 06:13.405
These are cute.                 

06:13.473 --> 06:14.406
Do you guys like this print?    

06:14.474 --> 06:15.441
>> KHLOE: It's a little more    

06:15.508 --> 06:16.975
boyish to me.                   

06:17.043 --> 06:18.043
>> KOURTNEY: Really?            

06:18.111 --> 06:19.078
>> KIM: Really?                 

06:19.145 --> 06:20.079
>> KHLOE: That's why I don't    

06:20.146 --> 06:21.080
really comment for the kid's    

06:21.147 --> 06:22.081
stuff, 'cause you guys freak    

06:22.148 --> 06:23.248
me out.                         

06:23.316 --> 06:24.350
>> BRUNO: We're done.           

06:24.417 --> 06:25.584
>> KIM: Thank you.              

06:25.652 --> 06:27.086
>> BRUNO: Bye.                  

06:27.153 --> 06:28.354
>> KIM: I need to talk to you   

06:28.421 --> 06:30.389
girls for a sec.                

06:30.457 --> 06:31.523
My video game-- I wanted to see 

06:31.591 --> 06:32.925
if you guys are gonna be in it. 

06:32.992 --> 06:34.393
We made the characters.         

06:34.461 --> 06:35.794
It looks so cute.               

06:35.862 --> 06:37.062
Kendall and Kylie want to.      

06:37.130 --> 06:38.664
Um, Mom...                      

06:38.732 --> 06:39.665
>> KHLOE: Just don't make me    

06:39.733 --> 06:40.666
look like a beast and I'm good. 

06:40.734 --> 06:41.667
>> KIM: But it's not about the  

06:41.735 --> 06:42.668
money.                          

06:42.736 --> 06:43.669
It's just gonna be something    

06:43.737 --> 06:44.670
you're gonna do or not.         

06:44.738 --> 06:45.671
>> KOURTNEY: I just don't get   

06:45.739 --> 06:46.772
why they use our name and       

06:46.840 --> 06:49.641
likeness and don't pay us.      

06:49.709 --> 06:51.176
Kim's making it seem like she's 

06:51.244 --> 06:53.379
doing us a favor by having us in

06:53.446 --> 06:55.447
her video game.                 

06:55.515 --> 06:56.648
All these other people are doing

06:56.716 --> 06:57.716
it.                             

06:57.784 --> 06:58.751
I'm pregnant.                   

06:58.818 --> 06:59.818
I have a lot going on.          

06:59.886 --> 07:00.819
I don't need to put myself into 

07:00.887 --> 07:02.254
one more thing.                 

07:02.322 --> 07:03.288
>> KIM: But, like, I have to    

07:03.356 --> 07:04.523
literally get you guys to sign  

07:04.591 --> 07:05.791
for your name and likeness.     

07:05.859 --> 07:07.192
>> KOURTNEY: Mm... maybe.       

07:07.260 --> 07:08.460
>> KIM: I mean, why am I not    

07:08.528 --> 07:09.561
shocked?                        

07:09.629 --> 07:11.030
Kourtney always is difficult.   

07:11.097 --> 07:12.564
When we were first starting out 

07:12.632 --> 07:13.966
our careers, I would do anything

07:14.034 --> 07:15.434
to help them out.               

07:15.502 --> 07:16.435
Kourtney doesn't have to lift a 

07:16.503 --> 07:17.436
finger, she doesn't have to do  

07:17.504 --> 07:18.470
anything.                       

07:18.538 --> 07:19.672
She should do this for me, like,

07:19.739 --> 07:21.173
with no questions asked.        

07:21.241 --> 07:22.174
>> KHLOE: Does that mean I can't

07:22.242 --> 07:23.175
do my own video game if I want  

07:23.243 --> 07:24.410
to?                             

07:24.477 --> 07:25.411
>> KIM: No, you should talk to  

07:25.478 --> 07:26.612
these people.                   

07:26.680 --> 07:27.646
>> KOURTNEY: We should do, uh,  

07:27.714 --> 07:28.647
<i>Kourtney and Khloe Take the</i>     

07:28.715 --> 07:29.648
<i>World.</i>                          

07:29.716 --> 07:30.916
>> KHLOE: Let's see how many    

07:30.984 --> 07:32.885
people pay for that upgrade.    

07:39.325 --> 07:40.492
>> KIM: Oh, hey, guys.          

07:40.560 --> 07:41.493
>> SCOTT: Oh, this is           

07:41.561 --> 07:42.561
ridiculous.                     

07:42.629 --> 07:43.996
>> KHLOE: Hey.                  

07:44.064 --> 07:45.364
>> SCOTT: Did you just get back 

07:45.432 --> 07:46.765
from Paris fashion week?        

07:46.833 --> 07:47.800
>> KHLOE: People that wear coats

07:47.867 --> 07:48.834
caped over their shoulders in   

07:48.902 --> 07:49.902
the house...                    

07:49.969 --> 07:50.969
>> KIM: Now, when else can I    

07:51.037 --> 07:52.438
wear a Chanel holey sweat suit? 

07:52.505 --> 07:53.439
>> KYLIE: Oh, I saw your        

07:53.506 --> 07:54.440
chiropractor today.             

07:54.507 --> 07:55.441
>> KIM: Did you like him?       

07:55.508 --> 07:56.442
>> KYLIE: Yeah.                 

07:56.509 --> 07:57.443
>> KIM: He's so nice.           

07:57.510 --> 07:58.444
Don't you wish he would date    

07:58.511 --> 07:59.445
Mom?                            

07:59.512 --> 08:00.446
>> SCOTT: Wait! We need to      

08:00.513 --> 08:01.714
discuss that Kylie and I just   

08:01.781 --> 08:03.382
saw these text messages with    

08:03.450 --> 08:05.584
some guy named Corey.           

08:05.652 --> 08:06.618
>> KHLOE: Wait a minute, what do

08:06.686 --> 08:08.120
you mean?                       

08:08.188 --> 08:09.521
>> SCOTT: Who is this guy?      

08:09.589 --> 08:10.923
Does anyone know who Corey is?  

08:10.990 --> 08:12.057
>> KHLOE: I don't.              

08:12.125 --> 08:13.459
>> KIM: I do.                   

08:13.526 --> 08:14.460
>> SCOTT: You do?               

08:14.527 --> 08:15.694
>> KIM: I took with me to Ibiza 

08:15.762 --> 08:17.363
for Ricardo's birthday party.   

08:17.430 --> 08:18.931
Justin was there.               

08:18.998 --> 08:20.666
Bieber, and he works with him.  

08:20.734 --> 08:22.534
>> SCOTT: Doing what? Security? 

08:22.602 --> 08:24.303
>> KIM: A road manager.         

08:24.371 --> 08:25.571
>> SCOTT: What is this guy      

08:25.638 --> 08:26.939
Corey's last name?              

08:27.007 --> 08:29.141
>> KIM: Corey... Gamble.        

08:29.209 --> 08:30.142
>> SCOTT: Here's the picture of 

08:30.210 --> 08:31.143
him.                            

08:31.211 --> 08:33.111
>> KYLIE: Let me see?           

08:33.179 --> 08:34.780
Hmm.                            

08:34.847 --> 08:36.148
>> SCOTT: He's 33.              

08:36.216 --> 08:37.216
There's only a 26-year-old      

08:37.283 --> 08:38.384
difference.                     

08:38.451 --> 08:39.852
>> KIM: He's younger than me.   

08:39.919 --> 08:41.186
My mom has been out of the      

08:41.254 --> 08:42.755
dating game for decades, so I   

08:42.822 --> 08:45.024
want her to have fun again and  

08:45.091 --> 08:46.592
to meet someone, but I just hope

08:46.659 --> 08:48.460
that she really thinks things   

08:48.528 --> 08:50.229
through and doesn't just rush   

08:50.296 --> 08:51.697
into anything.                  

08:51.765 --> 08:52.998
You know, I hope she's having   

08:53.066 --> 08:54.633
fun and I want that for her, but

08:54.701 --> 08:55.934
it's just, obviously it's weird 

08:56.002 --> 08:59.538
if she's dating someone new.    

08:59.606 --> 09:00.706
>> KHLOE: Who are you talking   

09:00.774 --> 09:01.974
to, Shady?                      

09:02.042 --> 09:03.208
>> KRIS: Just this guy.         

09:03.276 --> 09:04.510
He texts me all the time.       

09:04.577 --> 09:05.511
>> KHLOE: Have you guys hung out

09:05.578 --> 09:06.512
yet?                            

09:06.579 --> 09:07.346
>> KRIS: Like, for a couple of  

09:07.414 --> 09:08.047
dinners.                        

09:08.114 --> 09:11.450
>> KHLOE: Are you dating him?   

09:11.518 --> 09:12.551
>> KRIS: This is a cease and    

09:12.619 --> 09:14.486
desist for the Kim Kardashian   

09:14.554 --> 09:15.954
West video game.                

09:16.022 --> 09:17.022
>> KIM: Who is that from?       

09:17.090 --> 09:19.458
>> KRIS: Kourtney Kardashian.   

09:19.526 --> 09:21.093
(whooping)                      

09:21.161 --> 09:22.194
>> KRIS: Getting back out there 

09:22.262 --> 09:24.096
in the dating world is going to 

09:24.164 --> 09:26.398
be very interesting.            

09:26.466 --> 09:30.636
>> COREY: I'm a lucky (bleep).  

09:37.110 --> 09:38.377
>> KHLOE: Your fire is not large

09:38.445 --> 09:41.113
at all.                         

09:41.181 --> 09:44.116
>> KRIS: Yes, it is.            

09:44.184 --> 09:45.417
(Kris laughs quietly)           

09:45.485 --> 09:46.485
>> KHLOE: Who are you smirking  

09:46.553 --> 09:47.486
at?                             

09:47.554 --> 09:50.289
>> KRIS: Nothing.               

09:50.357 --> 09:51.690
(Kris laughs)                   

09:51.758 --> 09:52.358
What?                           

09:52.425 --> 09:53.058
>> KHLOE: Why are you smiling   

09:53.126 --> 09:53.726
like that?                      

09:53.793 --> 09:54.460
>> KRIS (laughing): I don't     

09:54.527 --> 09:55.461
know.                           

09:55.528 --> 09:56.261
(phone chimes)                  

09:56.329 --> 09:57.363
Sorry.                          

09:57.430 --> 09:58.163
>> KHLOE: Who are you talking   

09:58.231 --> 09:59.365
to, Shady?                      

09:59.432 --> 10:02.368
>> KRIS: Nobody.                

10:02.435 --> 10:04.269
Just this guy I met in Spain.   

10:04.337 --> 10:06.105
He's the guy I met at Riccardo  

10:06.172 --> 10:07.806
Tisci's birthday party, when I  

10:07.874 --> 10:09.241
went with Kim and Kanye.        

10:09.309 --> 10:11.643
He texts me all the time.       

10:11.711 --> 10:12.845
He's cute.                      

10:12.912 --> 10:14.313
>> KHLOE: Oh, he's cute?        

10:14.381 --> 10:15.547
How old is he?                  

10:15.615 --> 10:16.715
>> KRIS: Uh... I don't know how 

10:16.783 --> 10:17.916
old he is.                      

10:17.984 --> 10:18.984
>> KHLOE: Have you guys hung out

10:19.052 --> 10:19.985
yet?                            

10:20.053 --> 10:21.220
>> KRIS: Yeah, just, like, for a

10:21.287 --> 10:22.254
couple of dinners and stuff like

10:22.322 --> 10:23.455
that.                           

10:23.523 --> 10:25.157
Super cool, super chill, really 

10:25.225 --> 10:26.325
nice...                         

10:26.393 --> 10:29.595
>> KHLOE: Are you dating him?   

10:29.662 --> 10:32.097
>> KRIS: I don't know.          

10:32.165 --> 10:33.899
Just hanging out right now.     

10:33.967 --> 10:35.534
Getting back out there in the   

10:35.602 --> 10:38.070
dating world is going to be very

10:38.138 --> 10:40.239
interesting and, hopefully,     

10:40.306 --> 10:41.306
a lot of fun.                   

10:41.374 --> 10:43.008
I was married for 25 years and  

10:43.076 --> 10:46.378
that's a long time to be kind of

10:46.446 --> 10:47.646
out of the loop.                

10:47.714 --> 10:48.747
>> KHLOE: But I think it's cute 

10:48.815 --> 10:50.716
how much you're, like, smirking 

10:50.784 --> 10:51.850
and smiling... like, I get-- I  

10:51.918 --> 10:53.519
know that look and that feeling.

10:53.586 --> 10:55.087
But, like, that leads me to     

10:55.155 --> 10:56.522
believe that you might, like, be

10:56.589 --> 10:58.490
into him.                       

11:02.362 --> 11:03.395
>> KRIS: Are you the dating     

11:03.463 --> 11:04.196
police?                         

11:04.264 --> 11:04.997
>> KHLOE: No.                   

11:05.065 --> 11:05.864
>> KRIS: You're the one who's   

11:05.932 --> 11:06.665
been saying, "Mom, get out      

11:06.733 --> 11:07.833
there, get out there."          

11:07.901 --> 11:08.801
>> KHLOE: Yeah.                 

11:08.868 --> 11:10.169
But it's definitely weird when  

11:10.236 --> 11:14.139
your mom is dating someone.     

11:14.207 --> 11:15.708
No matter who he is.            

11:15.775 --> 11:17.476
It takes a minute.              

11:17.544 --> 11:20.212
Gotta, like... ease into it.    

11:20.280 --> 11:21.113
>> KRIS: To get used to it.     

11:21.181 --> 11:22.481
I'm sorry.                      

11:22.549 --> 11:24.016
It's ultimately going to be the 

11:24.084 --> 11:26.418
hardest thing for me to... date 

11:26.486 --> 11:28.887
somebody, because we all have   

11:28.955 --> 11:30.923
such crazy, big lives and I have

11:30.990 --> 11:32.091
a lot of kids.                  

11:32.158 --> 11:34.526
And my kids are all really      

11:34.594 --> 11:36.662
protective, especially you.     

11:36.730 --> 11:37.663
>> KHLOE: All I said was, "Don't

11:37.731 --> 11:39.198
get married."                   

11:39.265 --> 11:40.366
And you said, "Don't worry.     

11:40.433 --> 11:41.200
I'm not getting married."       

11:41.267 --> 11:42.101
>> KRIS: I never...             

11:42.168 --> 11:43.002
I don't think I would ever get  

11:43.069 --> 11:44.203
married again.                  

11:44.270 --> 11:45.037
>> KHLOE: You can (bleep)       

11:45.105 --> 11:45.704
whoever you want...             

11:45.772 --> 11:46.805
>> KRIS: Thank you.             

11:46.873 --> 11:47.539
>> KHLOE: ...just don't get     

11:47.607 --> 11:48.540
married right now.              

11:48.608 --> 11:50.843
There's a whole plethora of     

11:50.910 --> 11:52.578
people out there in the world.  

11:52.645 --> 11:55.914
We should all just enjoy.       

11:55.982 --> 11:57.316
>> KRIS: We'll see.             

11:57.384 --> 11:59.418
I don't have a crystal ball.    

12:14.234 --> 12:15.401
>> KHLOE: Sure you're going the 

12:15.468 --> 12:16.068
right way?                      

12:16.136 --> 12:17.069
>> MALIKA: Um, I really don't   

12:17.137 --> 12:18.470
know.                           

12:18.538 --> 12:19.138
But let's hope.                 

12:19.205 --> 12:20.305
>> KHLOE: 1815...               

12:20.373 --> 12:21.907
Scott and I have an appearance  

12:21.975 --> 12:23.175
in Canada together for          

12:23.243 --> 12:24.176
Halloween.                      

12:24.244 --> 12:25.811
And I'm bringing my bestie,     

12:25.879 --> 12:27.746
Malika, and Scott is bringing   

12:27.814 --> 12:28.781
Chris Reda.                     

12:28.848 --> 12:31.583
So I don't even have a costume. 

12:31.651 --> 12:33.752
I also found out, in the final  

12:33.820 --> 12:35.888
hour, that Brody is the DJ at   

12:35.955 --> 12:37.423
this party and Brody's a        

12:37.490 --> 12:38.424
drinker.                        

12:38.491 --> 12:39.425
So I just want to be there for  

12:39.492 --> 12:40.159
Scott, for a little extra       

12:40.226 --> 12:41.694
support.                        

12:41.761 --> 12:42.661
It's Halloween, we get to dress 

12:42.729 --> 12:43.796
up, and I'm really looking      

12:43.863 --> 12:45.798
forward to let loose, have fun  

12:45.865 --> 12:47.966
and just enjoy the night.       

12:48.034 --> 12:49.134
So I couldn't fit into my sailor

12:49.202 --> 12:50.336
outfit.                         

12:50.403 --> 12:51.537
It just didn't look as good as  

12:51.604 --> 12:53.605
when I wore it on <i> RuPaul.</i>       

12:53.673 --> 12:56.375
So I might just be a sexy kitty 

12:56.443 --> 12:57.509
in normal clothes and just wear 

12:57.577 --> 12:59.478
a mask.                         

13:02.716 --> 13:04.016
It is so sexy.                  

13:04.084 --> 13:05.184
We've taken Halloween to a whole

13:05.251 --> 13:06.385
'nother level.                  

13:06.453 --> 13:07.653
(Malika laughs)                 

13:07.721 --> 13:08.654
>> MALIKA: All this, to be a    

13:08.722 --> 13:09.655
black pussy?                    

13:09.723 --> 13:10.656
>> KHLOE: Can't really lift my  

13:10.724 --> 13:12.157
glass, 'cause my arms are tight,

13:12.225 --> 13:13.192
so I have to go...              

13:13.259 --> 13:13.926
(knocking at door)              

13:13.993 --> 13:14.793
>> SCOTT: Yello.                

13:14.861 --> 13:15.661
>> KHLOE (Jersey accent): Oh,   

13:15.729 --> 13:16.562
the Lord!                       

13:16.629 --> 13:19.231
(all laughing)                  

13:19.299 --> 13:20.699
>> MALIKA: This is the greatest 

13:20.767 --> 13:22.201
(bleep) I've ever seen.         

13:22.268 --> 13:24.036
Period.                         

13:24.104 --> 13:25.204
>> KHLOE: Very chic.            

13:25.271 --> 13:27.039
How'd you come up with this?    

13:27.107 --> 13:28.040
>> SCOTT: Well, I've always     

13:28.108 --> 13:30.642
wanted to be a Saudi prince,    

13:30.710 --> 13:32.344
so... when the lordship doesn't 

13:32.412 --> 13:33.612
take you far enough, you have to

13:33.680 --> 13:34.346
turn to the Saudi...            

13:34.414 --> 13:35.581
>> KHLOE: Yeah, you have to     

13:35.648 --> 13:37.182
advance.                        

13:37.250 --> 13:39.151
Let's go, Mama Jo.              

13:43.490 --> 13:45.924
>> KHLOE: Instagram!            

13:45.992 --> 13:46.925
(Chris laughs)                  

13:46.993 --> 13:48.494
What do I title ours?           

13:48.561 --> 13:49.928
I just wrote, "Sheik pussy."    

13:49.996 --> 13:50.929
Great.                          

13:50.997 --> 13:51.964
>> SCOTT: There's gonna be some 

13:52.032 --> 13:53.098
disturbing comments to that     

13:53.166 --> 13:54.199
picture.                        

13:54.267 --> 13:55.034
And I'm posting some (bleep)    

13:55.101 --> 13:56.702
pics.                           

13:56.770 --> 13:58.337
>> KHLOE: "Appropriate as       

13:58.405 --> 13:59.004
(bleep)."                       

13:59.072 --> 14:00.372
"Wow, this is so (bleep) up."   

14:00.440 --> 14:01.640
(laughs)                        

14:01.708 --> 14:03.676
"Wow, that's offensive.         

14:03.743 --> 14:04.877
Can't expect anything less from 

14:04.944 --> 14:06.145
Kardashians."                   

14:06.212 --> 14:07.613
Wait, what's wrong with it?     

14:07.681 --> 14:08.614
I don't understand.             

14:08.682 --> 14:09.682
"You really did it this time,   

14:09.749 --> 14:10.683
damn it."                       

14:10.750 --> 14:12.117
>> SCOTT: Damn.                 

14:12.185 --> 14:12.985
>> KHLOE: "What a (bleep) you   

14:13.053 --> 14:13.652
are."                           

14:13.720 --> 14:14.653
"Rude to the Arabs.             

14:14.721 --> 14:15.854
How dare you."                  

14:15.922 --> 14:17.656
Nothing is nice so far!         

14:17.724 --> 14:19.224
I'm like, what's happening?     

14:19.292 --> 14:20.659
Is this that bad?               

14:20.727 --> 14:22.628
"It's a culture, not a costume. 

14:22.696 --> 14:23.495
So disgusting and               

14:23.563 --> 14:24.363
disrespectful."                 

14:24.431 --> 14:25.064
>> CHRIS: What'd you say,       

14:25.131 --> 14:25.731
though?                         

14:25.799 --> 14:26.498
You said, "Sheik pussy."        

14:26.566 --> 14:27.700
Yeah, but now Scott's gonna get 

14:27.767 --> 14:28.701
it, because Scott just posted   

14:28.768 --> 14:30.869
this one.                       

14:30.937 --> 14:33.172
(all laughing)                  

14:33.239 --> 14:34.540
So they're gonna get off you    

14:34.607 --> 14:35.374
right now.                      

14:35.442 --> 14:36.642
These comments aren't that bad, 

14:36.710 --> 14:37.443
Scott.                          

14:37.510 --> 14:38.277
>> MALIKA: Like, everybody      

14:38.345 --> 14:39.411
dresses up as something funny.  

14:39.479 --> 14:40.245
>> KHLOE: Why are Scott's       

14:40.313 --> 14:41.080
comments not bad and I'm getting

14:41.147 --> 14:42.348
literal hate, but without even  

14:42.415 --> 14:43.282
posting hate?                   

14:43.350 --> 14:44.016
>> MALIKA: You want to know why?

14:44.084 --> 14:44.817
Because they know Scott doesn't 

14:44.884 --> 14:45.484
give a (bleep).                 

14:45.552 --> 14:46.285
>> CHRIS: "This is why he's our 

14:46.353 --> 14:46.952
god."                           

14:47.020 --> 14:48.153
"Let's be A-rabs."              

14:48.221 --> 14:49.154
>> MALIKA: Clearly, they expect 

14:49.222 --> 14:50.122
more of you than they do of     

14:50.190 --> 14:50.856
Scott.                          

14:50.924 --> 14:51.590
>> SCOTT: Right.                

14:51.658 --> 14:52.424
That's true.                    

14:52.492 --> 14:53.726
>> KHLOE: I'm getting, like...  

14:53.793 --> 14:55.527
My intentions was not to hurt   

14:55.595 --> 14:56.795
anyone's feelings or to go      

14:56.863 --> 14:58.330
against someone's religious     

14:58.398 --> 15:00.632
beliefs, but I don't understand 

15:00.700 --> 15:02.601
how I posted the exact same     

15:02.669 --> 15:04.136
Instagram Scott did and I'm     

15:04.204 --> 15:06.271
literally being brutalized,     

15:06.339 --> 15:08.374
while Scott is being praised    

15:08.441 --> 15:09.375
and...                          

15:09.442 --> 15:10.476
I feel like, why am I not       

15:10.543 --> 15:11.543
allowed to say the exact same   

15:11.611 --> 15:12.544
thing?                          

15:12.612 --> 15:14.546
I'm not in any Muslim nothing-- 

15:14.614 --> 15:15.781
I'm not even in a costume.      

15:15.849 --> 15:16.915
I have a (bleep) head thing on. 

15:16.983 --> 15:17.983
>> MALIKA: It's your comments.  

15:18.051 --> 15:18.984
>> KHLOE: "Have some respect,   

15:19.052 --> 15:19.985
you ignorant (bleep)."          

15:20.053 --> 15:21.186
>> CHRIS: "You're a funny cool  

15:21.254 --> 15:22.855
(bleep) and the Lord be         

15:22.922 --> 15:23.589
with you."                      

15:23.656 --> 15:25.057
(all laughing)                  

15:25.125 --> 15:26.291
Literally, my life (bleep) goal 

15:26.359 --> 15:27.292
is to be you.                   

15:27.360 --> 15:28.660
Long live Lord Disick."

(laughing)                      

15:37.203 --> 15:39.104
My second and third wife.       

15:39.706 --> 15:41.607
Oh, my God...                   

15:42.776 --> 15:43.809
>> KHLOE: Hi.                   

15:43.877 --> 15:46.278
(group cheering)                

15:46.346 --> 15:46.945
>> BRODY: Get us a round of     

15:47.013 --> 15:47.613
shots.                          

15:47.681 --> 15:48.280
Round of shots!                 

15:48.348 --> 15:48.981
Are we getting drunk?           

15:49.049 --> 15:49.715
>> KHLOE: That's what I was     

15:49.783 --> 15:51.684
waiting on.                     

15:55.155 --> 15:56.088
>> BRODY: Mind if we order some 

15:56.156 --> 15:56.922
drinks?                         

15:56.990 --> 15:59.458
Could we get 1942 shots, please?

15:59.526 --> 16:01.260
Don Julio, one, two...          

16:01.327 --> 16:02.294
uh, two...                      

16:02.362 --> 16:04.963
Are you good?                   

16:05.031 --> 16:06.331
>> KHLOE: I hope that by me     

16:06.399 --> 16:07.599
being here tonight, Scott will  

16:07.667 --> 16:09.702
choose the smarter decision in  

16:09.769 --> 16:11.303
not grabbing that shot.         

16:11.371 --> 16:12.504
>> BRODY: Cheers!               

16:12.572 --> 16:14.139
A lot to talk about.

Okay, cheers.                   

16:18.678 --> 16:19.845
Thanks for coming, guys.

You know, it's Halloween,       

16:20.680 --> 16:21.880
everybody's getting crazy.      

16:21.948 --> 16:22.881
>> SCOTT: You know, it's never  

16:22.949 --> 16:24.149
easy watching other people      

16:24.217 --> 16:26.352
having a huge party night.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.276
>> SCOTT: I got that turban off.

19:04.344 --> 19:07.713
>> CHRIS: Way better.           

19:07.781 --> 19:08.714
I want tequila, you don't have  

19:08.782 --> 19:09.715
tequila.                        

19:09.783 --> 19:10.716
>> WAITER: You want             

19:10.784 --> 19:11.817
Jagermeister, too, though?      

19:11.885 --> 19:12.818
>> CHRIS: Oh, no, what else do  

19:12.886 --> 19:13.819
you have?                       

19:13.887 --> 19:14.887
>> SCOTT: I got to say, for not 

19:14.954 --> 19:17.356
drinking, I'm having a pretty   

19:17.424 --> 19:19.625
great time, but it seems like   

19:19.693 --> 19:21.226
everybody's drinking more and   

19:21.294 --> 19:22.928
having more fun and more fun.   

19:22.996 --> 19:24.463
I think it's time.              

19:24.531 --> 19:25.464
Should we get going?            

19:25.532 --> 19:26.465
>> CHRIS: What?                 

19:26.533 --> 19:27.700
>> SCOTT: Can we get going?     

19:27.767 --> 19:28.834
Honestly, I'd like to just call 

19:28.902 --> 19:29.868
it a night for the first time in

19:29.936 --> 19:32.304
my life, and get to bed and get 

19:32.372 --> 19:34.273
home.                           

19:43.616 --> 19:45.551
>> KOURTNEY: Hello.             

19:45.618 --> 19:46.819
>> MASON: I'm happy.            

19:46.886 --> 19:47.820
>> KOURTNEY: That's cute.       

19:47.887 --> 19:49.288
That's cute.                    

19:49.356 --> 19:50.823
Do I keep this little T-shirt   

19:50.890 --> 19:51.957
that says "Robert"?             

19:52.025 --> 19:53.025
>> KHLOE: (chuckles)            

19:53.093 --> 19:55.194
Are you naming your kid that?   

19:55.261 --> 19:56.328
>> KOURTNEY: No, but it's cute. 

19:56.396 --> 19:57.329
Maybe just for, like, chill     

19:57.397 --> 19:58.330
clothes?                        

19:58.398 --> 19:59.331
>> KHLOE: Green pants?          

19:59.399 --> 20:00.332
If I ever wore green pants, you 

20:00.400 --> 20:01.333
would kill me.                  

20:01.401 --> 20:02.334
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah, but for a    

20:02.402 --> 20:03.335
kid?                            

20:03.403 --> 20:04.336
>> KHLOE: I don't know, do you  

20:04.404 --> 20:05.337
dress kids the same way you     

20:05.405 --> 20:06.705
dress an adult?                 

20:06.773 --> 20:09.975
>> KOURTNEY: No, I don't.       

20:10.043 --> 20:11.243
Did you get this e-mail from    

20:11.311 --> 20:13.512
Kim's attorney to sign this     

20:13.580 --> 20:14.980
contract?                       

20:15.048 --> 20:16.248
>> KHLOE: Mm-hmm.               

20:16.316 --> 20:17.383
>> KOURTNEY: So did you read it?

20:17.450 --> 20:18.450
>> KHLOE: Mm-hmm.               

20:18.518 --> 20:19.451
>> KOURTNEY: It's not just for  

20:19.519 --> 20:20.452
the charity.                    

20:20.520 --> 20:21.453
>> KHLOE: Yeah, I know.         

20:21.521 --> 20:22.454
>> KOURTNEY: So it's giving your

20:22.522 --> 20:24.623
name and likeness for...        

20:24.691 --> 20:27.626
basically, forever.             

20:27.694 --> 20:28.894
>> KHLOE: Kim sent over some    

20:28.962 --> 20:31.096
legal documents for us to sign, 

20:31.164 --> 20:33.265
so her video game can use our   

20:33.333 --> 20:35.534
image and likeness and Kim's    

20:35.602 --> 20:37.369
video game is a huge, like, pop 

20:37.437 --> 20:38.871
culture phenomenon, and I feel  

20:38.938 --> 20:40.205
like your sister's asking you to

20:40.273 --> 20:41.907
do something, so do it.         

20:41.975 --> 20:42.975
Yeah, but it's a free video     

20:43.043 --> 20:43.976
game.                           

20:44.044 --> 20:45.110
>> KOURTNEY: What do you mean?  

20:45.178 --> 20:46.111
>> KHLOE: Like, she doesn't get 

20:46.179 --> 20:47.112
paid.                           

20:47.180 --> 20:48.113
>> KOURTNEY: You don't think she

20:48.181 --> 20:49.114
makes money off of this?        

20:49.182 --> 20:50.115
>> KHLOE: No, she... she makes  

20:50.183 --> 20:51.116
money.                          

20:51.184 --> 20:52.818
It's not like you buy a Khloe   

20:52.886 --> 20:53.886
person, like, I'm just, like, a 

20:53.953 --> 20:54.887
free add-on.                    

20:54.954 --> 20:55.921
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah, but you're   

20:55.989 --> 20:58.624
adding to the game.             

20:58.692 --> 21:00.726
Are you gonna do it?            

21:00.794 --> 21:01.894
>> KHLOE: I mean, I am, 'cause  

21:01.961 --> 21:03.762
she just wants me to.           

21:03.830 --> 21:04.763
>> KOURTNEY: She just said, "So 

21:04.831 --> 21:06.799
and so and so and so is doing   

21:06.866 --> 21:09.201
it, do you guys want to do it?" 

21:09.269 --> 21:10.202
>> KHLOE: Yeah, but I...        

21:10.270 --> 21:11.203
>> KOURTNEY: And in the moment I

21:11.271 --> 21:13.005
said, "I'll think about it."    

21:13.073 --> 21:14.640
But then I randomly got this    

21:14.708 --> 21:16.675
contract sent.                  

21:16.743 --> 21:18.077
>> KHLOE: I don't mind doing it.

21:18.144 --> 21:19.078
>> KOURTNEY: Do whatever you    

21:19.145 --> 21:20.479
want, I don't care.             

21:20.547 --> 21:21.814
I'm just telling you I am not   

21:21.881 --> 21:23.982
going to do it.                 

21:24.050 --> 21:26.218
After my conversation with Kim, 

21:26.286 --> 21:28.354
I thought I made it really clear

21:28.421 --> 21:30.022
that I wasn't sure if I want to 

21:30.090 --> 21:31.857
be a part of her video game, so 

21:31.925 --> 21:34.193
I'm just not sure why I'm       

21:34.260 --> 21:35.861
getting contracts from my       

21:35.929 --> 21:36.862
attorney.                       

21:36.930 --> 21:39.298
I just... I'm really confused.  

21:39.366 --> 21:40.499
>> KHLOE: You're ruthless.      

21:40.567 --> 21:41.633
>> KOURTNEY: Oh, how cute are   

21:41.701 --> 21:43.602
these?                          

21:50.043 --> 21:51.977
>> PAPARAZZO: Khloe, over here. 

21:52.045 --> 21:52.978
>> WOMAN: Hi.                   

21:53.046 --> 21:53.979
>> PAPARAZZO: Khloe, here,      

21:54.047 --> 21:54.980
straight ahead, straight on me. 

21:55.048 --> 21:55.981
>> PAPARAZZO 2: Look up, Khloe. 

21:56.049 --> 21:56.982
(all clamoring)                 

21:57.050 --> 21:57.983
>> KEN: Well, you look          

21:58.051 --> 21:58.984
beautiful.                      

21:59.052 --> 21:59.585
>> KHLOE: Oh, thank you.        

21:59.652 --> 22:00.586
>> KEN: I-I just said that      

22:00.653 --> 22:01.086
and, like...                    

22:01.154 --> 22:02.087
>> KHLOE: Stared at my (bleep)? 

22:02.155 --> 22:03.088
>> KEN: Yeah, oops.             

22:03.156 --> 22:04.089
>> KHLOE: It's okay, they're a  

22:04.157 --> 22:05.090
mouthful, so that's all you     

22:05.158 --> 22:06.091
need.                           

22:06.159 --> 22:07.092
>> KEN: Oh... Hello, uh...      

22:07.160 --> 22:08.093
>> KHLOE: Right? Good morning!  

22:08.161 --> 22:09.094
>> KEN: God, it's early.        

22:09.162 --> 22:10.095
Um, what is this random Kim     

22:10.163 --> 22:11.096
tweet saying she loves you and  

22:11.164 --> 22:12.097
French together?                

22:12.165 --> 22:13.098
>> KHLOE: She's cute, right?    

22:13.166 --> 22:14.099
I mean, we all miss French, we  

22:14.167 --> 22:15.100
love French.                    

22:15.168 --> 22:16.101
>> KEN: Yeah, but you're not    

22:16.169 --> 22:17.102
dating him.                     

22:17.170 --> 22:18.103
>> KHLOE: I'm still friends with

22:18.171 --> 22:19.104
him, I talk to him, like, every 

22:19.172 --> 22:20.105
day, I talked to him before I   

22:20.173 --> 22:21.106
came here, but I'm not dating   

22:21.174 --> 22:22.107
anybody.                        

22:22.175 --> 22:23.108
>> KEN: Okay, I'm gonna break   

22:23.176 --> 22:24.109
some news to you that is actual 

22:24.177 --> 22:25.110
dating news.                    

22:25.178 --> 22:26.111
>> KHLOE: Oh, tell me.          

22:26.179 --> 22:27.112
>> KEN: Um, I confirmed,        

22:27.180 --> 22:28.280
actually, as I was driving over 

22:28.348 --> 22:29.515
here, I confirmed that your     

22:29.582 --> 22:30.516
mama...                         

22:30.583 --> 22:31.517
>> KHLOE: Okay.                 

22:31.584 --> 22:33.152
>> KEN: ...is dating Corey.     

22:33.219 --> 22:36.855
>> KHLOE: Um...                 

22:36.923 --> 22:38.323
How did you confirm, 'cause I   

22:38.391 --> 22:39.324
can't be tricked into this.     

22:39.392 --> 22:41.093
>> KEN: Uh, sources, I have     

22:41.161 --> 22:42.728
sources, I'm telling you that as

22:42.796 --> 22:44.697
a friend, I did confirm this.   

22:44.764 --> 22:45.864
>> KHLOE: Okay.                 

22:45.932 --> 22:47.399
I pretty much feel ambushed at  

22:47.467 --> 22:49.368
this point, because my mom      

22:49.436 --> 22:51.537
apparently gave quotes about her

22:51.604 --> 22:53.038
relationship with her new       

22:53.106 --> 22:54.673
boyfriend and I don't know how  

22:54.741 --> 22:57.042
to answer this question.        

22:57.110 --> 22:58.444
My mom is really happy.         

22:58.511 --> 22:59.445
>> KEN: Good.                   

22:59.512 --> 23:00.446
>> KHLOE: So I like to see her  

23:00.513 --> 23:02.981
in such a positive, happy state.

23:03.049 --> 23:04.249
It's a good Kris Jenner.        

23:04.317 --> 23:05.250
>> KEN: You're beautiful.       

23:05.318 --> 23:06.251
>> KHLOE: Love you.             

23:06.319 --> 23:07.252
>> KEN: Love you more.          

23:07.320 --> 23:08.387
Thank you.                      

23:08.455 --> 23:10.956
(paparazzi clamoring)           

23:11.024 --> 23:12.257
>> KHLOE: My mom-slash-manager  

23:12.325 --> 23:13.826
is supposed to be giving me the 

23:13.893 --> 23:15.594
heads-up, like, "Oh, by the way,

23:15.662 --> 23:16.995
you might be asked a question or

23:17.063 --> 23:18.397
two" and she's pretty much      

23:18.465 --> 23:20.099
denied that she's dating Corey  

23:20.166 --> 23:22.001
every time I ask her.           

23:22.068 --> 23:24.470
(phone line ringing)            

23:24.537 --> 23:25.471
>> KRIS: Good morning.          

23:25.538 --> 23:26.839
>> KHLOE: Hello, Mom?           

23:26.906 --> 23:27.840
>> KRIS: Yeah?                  

23:27.907 --> 23:28.841
>> KHLOE: Did you feel like     

23:28.908 --> 23:30.376
maybe warning me that you were  

23:30.443 --> 23:32.344
giving a confirmation that      

23:32.412 --> 23:33.645
you're dating someone would be  

23:33.713 --> 23:35.014
good before I did a press day?  

23:35.081 --> 23:36.015
>> KRIS: I don't have... I did  

23:36.082 --> 23:37.016
not confirm I was dating        

23:37.083 --> 23:38.017
anybody.                        

23:38.084 --> 23:39.018
>> KHLOE: Mom.                  

23:39.085 --> 23:40.019
>> KRIS: So you should... I, you

23:40.086 --> 23:41.020
say nothing.                    

23:41.087 --> 23:42.054
>> KHLOE: Did you not talk to   

23:42.122 --> 23:45.190
Ken Baker?                      

23:45.258 --> 23:46.425
>> KRIS: No, I did not talk to  

23:46.493 --> 23:48.193
Ken Baker, I'm not confirming   

23:48.261 --> 23:49.361
anything-- I don't know what's  

23:49.429 --> 23:50.362
gonna happen, I could be dating 

23:50.430 --> 23:51.463
somebody else next week.        

23:51.531 --> 23:52.464
I'm getting him on the phone    

23:52.532 --> 23:53.465
right now.                      

23:53.533 --> 23:54.466
>> KHLOE: Okay, well, you could 

23:54.534 --> 23:55.834
seriously take a (bleep) Xanax  

23:55.902 --> 23:56.835
and don't (bleep) yell at me    

23:56.903 --> 23:57.836
like that, because I don't      

23:57.904 --> 23:58.837
deserve this (bleep).           

23:58.905 --> 23:59.838
>> KRIS: Please don't be mad.   

23:59.906 --> 24:01.473
>> KHLOE: I'm just saying, as a 

24:01.541 --> 24:02.775
manager, I would just like to   

24:02.842 --> 24:04.009
know, because I'm, like,        

24:04.077 --> 24:05.477
ambushed.                       

24:05.545 --> 24:06.645
>> KRIS: I'm so sorry, and I    

24:06.713 --> 24:08.047
never confirmed it.             

24:08.114 --> 24:09.048
It'll be yesterday's news in a  

24:09.115 --> 24:10.049
week.                           

24:10.116 --> 24:11.050
>> KHLOE: I mean, it's <i> One Flew </i>

24:11.117 --> 24:12.618
<i>Over the (bleep) Cuckoo's Nest</i>  

24:12.686 --> 24:16.055
with you, dude.                 

24:16.122 --> 24:19.625
I posted something on Instagram.

24:19.693 --> 24:20.726
I wrote, "Sheik pussy."         

24:20.794 --> 24:21.727
Is that offensive?              

24:21.795 --> 24:22.728
>> DURRANI: I think it's...     

24:22.796 --> 24:24.730
>> NAZY: What's more, like,     

24:24.798 --> 24:28.667
upsetting is the words.         

24:28.735 --> 24:29.868
>> KIM: For Scott to call me and

24:29.936 --> 24:31.103
say, "You should buy her a pair 

24:31.171 --> 24:32.638
of shoes"-- I said, "I-I'm not  

24:32.706 --> 24:33.672
buying her a (bleep) pair of    

24:33.740 --> 24:34.773
shoes, I bought her a (bleep)   

24:34.841 --> 24:36.742
career."                        

24:44.517 --> 24:46.452
>> SCOTT: Hey, Puscani.         

24:46.519 --> 24:48.153
>> KHLOE: Come here real quick. 

24:48.221 --> 24:49.855
We'll go out... Your-Your dad'll

24:49.923 --> 24:50.889
take you outside in a minute.   

24:50.957 --> 24:51.890
(Penelope fusses)               

24:51.958 --> 24:53.659
So Malika and I, like, we're    

24:53.727 --> 24:55.127
both obsessed with Tomer.       

24:55.195 --> 24:56.128
>> SCOTT: He's the best.        

24:56.196 --> 24:57.196
>> KHLOE: And then Malika's     

24:57.263 --> 24:58.197
like, "If Tomer wasn't a        

24:58.264 --> 24:59.665
redhead"-- or a ginger or       

24:59.733 --> 25:00.666
whatever-- she's like, "I       

25:00.734 --> 25:01.667
would" and I was like, "You     

25:01.735 --> 25:02.668
would what?"                    

25:02.736 --> 25:03.669
>> SCOTT: Has Malika ever dated 

25:03.737 --> 25:04.670
a white man?                    

25:04.738 --> 25:05.671
>> KHLOE: Nick Carter.          

25:05.739 --> 25:06.672
>> SCOTT: From the Backstreet   

25:06.740 --> 25:07.673
Boys?                           

25:07.741 --> 25:08.674
>> KHLOE: Yes.                  

25:08.742 --> 25:12.611
>> SCOTT: No, no!               

25:12.679 --> 25:14.246
>> KHLOE: So how was Canada for 

25:14.314 --> 25:15.247
you?                            

25:15.315 --> 25:16.281
>> SCOTT: I had a good time.    

25:16.349 --> 25:19.151
I feel like everybody was pretty

25:19.219 --> 25:21.153
tame, I mean, you guys were     

25:21.221 --> 25:22.154
drinking a little.              

25:22.222 --> 25:23.455
I had, like...                  

25:23.523 --> 25:24.623
a half a glass of wine and that 

25:24.691 --> 25:25.624
was about it.                   

25:25.692 --> 25:26.625
And just relaxed.               

25:26.693 --> 25:27.626
>> KHLOE: But is it hard for you

25:27.694 --> 25:28.627
to be ar... Like, Brody was,    

25:28.695 --> 25:29.628
like, wild, and all of his      

25:29.696 --> 25:30.629
friends get really wild.        

25:30.697 --> 25:31.630
And they're like, "Let's do a   

25:31.698 --> 25:32.631
shot."                          

25:32.699 --> 25:33.632
Like, I'm like, how old are you 

25:33.700 --> 25:34.633
and how long are you gonna do   

25:34.701 --> 25:35.634
shots for your whole life?      

25:35.702 --> 25:36.635
>> SCOTT: Yeah, I could probably

25:36.703 --> 25:39.104
do them till I'm dead.          

25:39.172 --> 25:40.639
But yeah, I mean, I just feel   

25:40.707 --> 25:41.640
like I got to pick my battles,  

25:41.708 --> 25:42.675
you know what I mean?           

25:42.742 --> 25:44.376
I mean, listen, doing events and

25:44.444 --> 25:48.047
parties is one of my jobs.      

25:48.114 --> 25:49.748
So it's like I don't want to    

25:49.816 --> 25:51.550
mess that up and I feel like I  

25:51.618 --> 25:53.419
can't go to these things and act

25:53.486 --> 25:54.620
like an animal.                 

25:54.688 --> 25:56.088
I just don't want to not be able

25:56.156 --> 25:58.323
to drink at all, 'cause then I  

25:58.391 --> 25:59.324
just... all I... all I think    

25:59.392 --> 26:01.360
about is drinking.              

26:01.428 --> 26:02.895
We'll see, I mean, I'm trying to

26:02.962 --> 26:04.296
give this a whirl, just being   

26:04.364 --> 26:06.265
calm, but I don't drink at home 

26:06.332 --> 26:07.333
or anything like that.          

26:07.400 --> 26:09.335
>> PENELOPE: I... ya, ya.       

26:09.402 --> 26:10.602
>> KHLOE: Listen, these are     

26:10.670 --> 26:11.970
sharp, so when you hit your head

26:12.038 --> 26:12.971
against this, it scares KoKo,   

26:13.039 --> 26:13.972
okay?                           

26:14.040 --> 26:14.973
>> SCOTT: (whoops)              

26:15.041 --> 26:15.974
I scared you, Pusci.            

26:16.042 --> 26:16.975
>> PENELOPE: No.                

26:17.043 --> 26:17.976
>> SCOTT: I love this little    

26:18.044 --> 26:19.945
girl.                           

26:30.123 --> 26:34.026
(paparazzi clamoring)           

26:34.094 --> 26:36.095
>> DURRANI: Hi.                 

26:36.162 --> 26:36.895
>> MALIKA: Sorry, I'm losing my 

26:36.963 --> 26:37.563
voice.                          

26:37.630 --> 26:38.230
>> DURRANI: I missed you so     

26:38.298 --> 26:38.897
much.                           

26:38.965 --> 26:39.999
>> MALIKA: I missed you, too.   

26:40.066 --> 26:41.200
How are you?                    

26:41.267 --> 26:42.534
We're having major problems with

26:42.602 --> 26:43.535
our sales today.                

26:43.603 --> 26:44.536
>> KHLOE: I'm going to a        

26:44.604 --> 26:45.604
basketball game and I haven't   

26:45.672 --> 26:47.606
been since Lamar and I'm, like, 

26:47.674 --> 26:49.141
really scared to go.            

26:49.209 --> 26:50.909
>> ROYA: No, you look so hot.   

26:50.977 --> 26:51.910
>> KHLOE: But I'm not really    

26:51.978 --> 26:53.645
into these shoes with this.     

26:53.713 --> 26:54.980
My hair is tight.               

26:55.048 --> 26:57.449
I don't want my hair tight.     

26:57.517 --> 26:58.450
(Khloe exhales)                 

26:58.518 --> 26:59.451
>> ROYA: Just breathe.          

26:59.519 --> 27:00.452
>> KHLOE: See, Malika, I        

27:00.520 --> 27:01.453
shouldn't go to a basketball    

27:01.521 --> 27:02.454
game with you.                  

27:02.522 --> 27:03.455
>> MALIKA: Okay.                

27:03.523 --> 27:05.190
>> KHLOE: (chuckles) Do one of  

27:05.258 --> 27:06.291
you guys know how to read       

27:06.359 --> 27:07.292
Arabic?                         

27:07.360 --> 27:08.293
You do, right?                  

27:08.361 --> 27:09.294
>> DURRANI: Yeah.               

27:09.362 --> 27:10.829
>> KHLOE: So I posted something 

27:10.897 --> 27:11.830
on Instagram.                   

27:11.898 --> 27:12.831
It was for Halloween.           

27:12.899 --> 27:13.832
Scott was a sheik.              

27:13.900 --> 27:14.833
>> DURRANI: Oh, I remember.     

27:14.901 --> 27:15.834
You were a kitty cat.           

27:15.902 --> 27:17.102
>> KHLOE: A cat. Thank you.     

27:17.170 --> 27:18.570
I wrote "Sheik pussy."          

27:18.638 --> 27:20.205
But is that offensive?          

27:20.273 --> 27:21.206
>> DURRANI: To me, personally,  

27:21.274 --> 27:22.207
no.                             

27:22.275 --> 27:23.208
And I don't think it's the      

27:23.276 --> 27:24.076
caption.                        

27:24.144 --> 27:25.210
I think it's 'cause you were    

27:25.278 --> 27:25.644
covered...                      

27:25.712 --> 27:26.645
>> KHLOE: Oh, so it wasn't what 

27:26.713 --> 27:27.713
I said-- it was how we looked.  

27:27.781 --> 27:28.747
>> DURRANI: Yeah.               

27:28.815 --> 27:29.748
>> MALIKA: Wait, but I thought  

27:29.816 --> 27:30.749
they were mad at the caption.   

27:30.817 --> 27:31.750
>> KHLOE: Well, that's what     

27:31.818 --> 27:32.751
I'm assuming...                 

27:32.819 --> 27:33.752
>> MALIKA: I thought they were  

27:33.820 --> 27:34.753
mad at, like, everything.       

27:34.821 --> 27:36.355
>> NAZY: I don't think that...  

27:36.423 --> 27:38.357
the whole cover thing was an    

27:38.425 --> 27:38.791
issue.                          

27:38.858 --> 27:39.358
>> KHLOE: Okay...               

27:39.426 --> 27:40.192
>> NAZY: Like, I think just,    

27:40.260 --> 27:40.693
like...                         

27:40.760 --> 27:41.694
>> KHLOE: Do you think... Are   

27:41.761 --> 27:42.861
you more offended by my words?  

27:42.929 --> 27:44.530
>> NAZY: I think the more...    

27:44.597 --> 27:45.531
what's more, like, upsetting is 

27:45.598 --> 27:46.532
the fact that... just the words,

27:46.599 --> 27:47.533
you know what I mean?           

27:47.600 --> 27:48.534
>> KHLOE: To put the words      

27:48.601 --> 27:49.535
together.                       

27:49.602 --> 27:50.536
>> NAZY: Yeah.                  

27:50.603 --> 27:51.603
>> KHLOE: After talking with    

27:51.671 --> 27:53.539
Nazy and Durrani, I'm really    

27:53.606 --> 27:54.707
upset that I've offended        

27:54.774 --> 27:56.208
anybody.                        

27:56.276 --> 27:57.509
I'm even more bothered that a   

27:57.577 --> 27:58.844
lot of the commenters are       

27:58.912 --> 28:00.012
thinking that I'm poking fun of 

28:00.080 --> 28:01.013
their culture.                  

28:01.081 --> 28:02.014
Well, I just didn't realize how 

28:02.082 --> 28:03.015
offensive it was.               

28:03.083 --> 28:04.016
I was, like... I did not think I

28:04.084 --> 28:05.017
did anything wrong.             

28:05.085 --> 28:06.018
And I don't want to offend      

28:06.086 --> 28:07.019
anyone.                         

28:07.087 --> 28:08.020
>> MALIKA: If you had known, you

28:08.088 --> 28:09.021
wouldn't have done it.          

28:09.089 --> 28:10.022
>> KHLOE: I really have to just 

28:10.090 --> 28:12.458
be more aware of what I write,  

28:12.525 --> 28:13.592
even if I think it's            

28:13.660 --> 28:14.860
tongue-in-cheek, and I have to  

28:14.928 --> 28:16.195
be more sensitive to that.      

28:16.262 --> 28:17.696
I'm so sorry for anybody that I 

28:17.764 --> 28:19.098
offended.                       

28:19.165 --> 28:20.265
That was the last thing I ever  

28:20.333 --> 28:21.700
wanted to do.                   

28:21.768 --> 28:22.701
Hey, everyone, what's the       

28:22.769 --> 28:23.702
vote-vote?                      

28:23.770 --> 28:24.703
>> NAZY: First outfit.          

28:24.771 --> 28:25.704
>> KHLOE: Who wants the red     

28:25.772 --> 28:26.705
jacket?                         

28:26.773 --> 28:27.706
>> DURRANI: I think that both of

28:27.774 --> 28:28.707
'em look good, so whatever      

28:28.775 --> 28:29.708
you're comfortable in.          

28:29.776 --> 28:30.709
>> KHLOE: I just feel like I'm a

28:30.777 --> 28:32.177
little bright in red, and I     

28:32.245 --> 28:33.178
would rather not show my butt,  

28:33.246 --> 28:34.179
either.                         

28:34.247 --> 28:35.180
>> DURRANI: Why? If I had your  

28:35.248 --> 28:36.548
butt, oh, my God, I'd paint it. 

28:36.616 --> 28:37.750
>> KHLOE: A little just large   

28:37.817 --> 28:39.718
and in charge.                  

28:48.995 --> 28:50.596
>> KOURTNEY: Uh, Teflon.        

28:50.663 --> 28:51.597
>> KHLOE: Kourtney, I like      

28:51.664 --> 28:52.631
Teflon.                         

28:52.699 --> 28:53.832
>> KOURTNEY: Is that coming off?

28:53.900 --> 28:54.967
>> KHLOE: It's not coming off.  

28:55.035 --> 28:55.968
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah, it's really  

28:56.036 --> 28:57.336
bad.                            

28:57.404 --> 28:58.337
>> KHLOE: I forgot how much I   

28:58.405 --> 28:59.705
missed you coming over.         

28:59.773 --> 29:00.706
(door opens, slams)             

29:00.774 --> 29:02.341
>> KIM: Kourt, are you serious? 

29:02.409 --> 29:03.342
>> KOURTNEY: I don't want to be 

29:03.410 --> 29:04.343
in your video game.             

29:04.411 --> 29:05.344
>> KIM: I got it.               

29:05.412 --> 29:06.845
You're not gonna be in it.      

29:06.913 --> 29:08.180
It's ridiculous for you to just 

29:08.248 --> 29:09.181
not do that for me as a favor   

29:09.249 --> 29:10.182
'cause I've done so much for    

29:10.250 --> 29:11.183
you.                            

29:11.251 --> 29:12.184
And for Scott to call me and    

29:12.252 --> 29:13.185
say, "You should buy her a pair 

29:13.253 --> 29:14.186
of shoes to put..."             

29:14.254 --> 29:15.187
>> KOURTNEY: I don't need a pair

29:15.255 --> 29:16.188
of shoes.                       

29:16.256 --> 29:17.189
I can buy my own shoes.         

29:17.257 --> 29:18.190
>> KIM: And I'm like, "Buy her a

29:18.258 --> 29:19.191
(bleep) pair of shoes?          

29:19.259 --> 29:20.192
All the (bleep) I've done for   

29:20.260 --> 29:21.193
her?"                           

29:21.261 --> 29:22.194
I said to Scott, "I'm not buying

29:22.262 --> 29:23.395
her a (bleep) pair of shoes.    

29:23.463 --> 29:26.031
I bought her a (bleep) career." 

29:26.099 --> 29:27.666
Kourtney should do this for me  

29:27.734 --> 29:29.401
as a favor, but she's like, "I  

29:29.469 --> 29:30.436
don't need a video game         

29:30.503 --> 29:31.503
character.                      

29:31.571 --> 29:32.905
What will this do for me?"      

29:32.972 --> 29:33.906
Sometimes it's not about what it

29:33.973 --> 29:35.307
will do for you.                

29:35.375 --> 29:36.542
I mean, the game is supposed to 

29:36.609 --> 29:38.877
mirror my real life, so I think 

29:38.945 --> 29:40.346
it's fun to include all my      

29:40.413 --> 29:41.914
family in that.                 

29:41.981 --> 29:42.915
I don't know why she's being so 

29:42.982 --> 29:44.316
stubborn.                       

29:44.384 --> 29:45.484
It's just lame to not do me a   

29:45.552 --> 29:47.119
favor.                          

29:47.187 --> 29:49.388
Like, I bend over backwards and 

29:49.456 --> 29:50.456
do business deals for the       

29:50.523 --> 29:52.057
benefit of you guys when I've   

29:52.125 --> 29:53.559
had my own deals.               

29:53.626 --> 29:54.860
And I'm not gonna be bending    

29:54.928 --> 29:56.028
over backwards if I feel like   

29:56.096 --> 29:57.029
people aren't gonna do me       

29:57.097 --> 29:58.030
favors.                         

29:58.098 --> 29:59.031
>> KOURTNEY: You never asked as 

29:59.099 --> 30:00.032
a favor.                        

30:00.100 --> 30:02.501
Never once.                     

30:02.569 --> 30:04.103
So if you presented it as a     

30:04.170 --> 30:05.804
favor and said, "Do you want to 

30:05.872 --> 30:07.239
do me a favor and will you guys 

30:07.307 --> 30:08.240
please do this for me?"         

30:08.308 --> 30:09.241
>> KIM: I have asked.           

30:09.309 --> 30:10.242
I have asked.                   

30:10.310 --> 30:11.243
>> KOURTNEY: Did she ask like   

30:11.311 --> 30:12.244
that?                           

30:12.312 --> 30:13.245
>> KHLOE: You didn't.           

30:13.313 --> 30:14.246
We were in our Kardashian Kids  

30:14.314 --> 30:17.816
meeting.                        

30:17.884 --> 30:19.251
>> KIM: It's so lame that, like,

30:19.319 --> 30:20.886
everyone else wants to be in it.

30:20.954 --> 30:21.887
The only reason you didn't is if

30:21.955 --> 30:22.888
I didn't pay you.               

30:22.956 --> 30:23.889
>> KOURTNEY: I don't want the   

30:23.957 --> 30:24.890
money.                          

30:24.958 --> 30:26.058
I don't have to do anything.    

30:26.126 --> 30:27.192
>> KIM: But you're contradicting

30:27.260 --> 30:28.894
yourself because before you said

30:28.962 --> 30:30.896
you just wanted to be paid.     

30:30.964 --> 30:31.930
>> KOURTNEY: I don't care to do 

30:31.998 --> 30:33.065
random things.                  

30:33.133 --> 30:34.066
>> KIM: You-you don't have to do

30:34.134 --> 30:35.067
one thing.                      

30:35.135 --> 30:36.101
>> KOURTNEY: But I don't care to

30:36.169 --> 30:38.037
do more than I'm doing.         

30:38.104 --> 30:39.038
>> KIM: Oh, you're too          

30:39.105 --> 30:40.939
overexposed?                    

30:41.007 --> 30:42.041
>> KOURTNEY: I don't want to be 

30:42.108 --> 30:44.710
in it.                          

30:44.778 --> 30:45.944
>> KIM: We all do each other    

30:46.012 --> 30:47.246
family favors.                  

30:47.313 --> 30:48.280
That's just what we do.         

30:48.348 --> 30:49.281
That's who we are.              

30:49.349 --> 30:50.282
So I just think of your         

30:50.350 --> 30:53.252
character, it's pretty (bleep). 

30:55.355 --> 30:56.422
>> KOURTNEY: You're, like, such 

30:56.489 --> 30:57.423
a joke.                         

30:57.490 --> 30:58.424
People want different things in 

30:58.491 --> 31:00.392
life.                           

31:03.063 --> 31:04.029
>> KIM: I feel like I'm worried 

31:04.097 --> 31:05.698
about Mom a little bit.         

31:05.765 --> 31:06.699
I'll look online, and there'll  

31:06.766 --> 31:07.700
be all these pictures of her and

31:07.767 --> 31:08.701
Corey.                          

31:08.768 --> 31:09.702
She doesn't listen to me when   

31:09.769 --> 31:10.703
I'm like, "You know, you should 

31:10.770 --> 31:11.737
really take it slow."           

31:11.805 --> 31:12.805
>> SCOTT: Didn't you get married

31:12.872 --> 31:13.872
both times, after a couple      

31:13.940 --> 31:15.307
months?                         

31:15.375 --> 31:16.308
>> KIM: Why are you being so    

31:16.376 --> 31:17.309
difficult?                      

31:17.377 --> 31:18.310
>> KRIS: Kourtney, maybe you can

31:18.378 --> 31:19.745
tell her what would make you    

31:19.813 --> 31:20.846
happy.                          

31:20.914 --> 31:21.847
>> KOURTNEY: You never asked as 

31:21.915 --> 31:22.848
a favor.                        

31:22.916 --> 31:23.849
I have to go.                   

31:23.917 --> 31:25.818
>> KRIS: Oh...                  

31:35.395 --> 31:36.562
>> SCOTT: Where are you going?  

31:36.629 --> 31:37.629
>> KIM: Australia, Dubai, and   

31:37.697 --> 31:38.630
India.                          

31:38.698 --> 31:39.631
>> SCOTT: You travel too much.  

31:39.699 --> 31:40.733
>> KHLOE: I think we all do.    

31:40.800 --> 31:41.400
>> KIM: Yeah, we all do.        

31:41.468 --> 31:42.534
>> SCOTT: I don't. I try, but I 

31:42.602 --> 31:43.535
usually am told I can't.        

31:43.603 --> 31:44.970
>> KHLOE: You're usually told   

31:45.038 --> 31:45.838
you can't do anything.          

31:45.905 --> 31:46.572
>> SCOTT: Yeah. I w... I was    

31:46.639 --> 31:47.439
gonna go to Israel to see the   

31:47.507 --> 31:48.040
motherland.                     

31:48.108 --> 31:48.774
>> KHLOE: Are you trying to run 

31:48.842 --> 31:49.441
away?                           

31:49.509 --> 31:50.376
>> SCOTT: No, I wasn't gonna go 

31:50.443 --> 31:51.110
live in Israel.                 

31:51.177 --> 31:52.111
Get back there, "My people, I've

31:52.178 --> 31:53.112
come!"                          

31:53.179 --> 31:54.113
>> KHLOE: What if you got there 

31:54.180 --> 31:55.114
and you fell in love?           

31:55.181 --> 31:56.115
>> SCOTT: I wouldn't come home. 

31:56.182 --> 31:57.383
>> KIM: Um, I just feel like I'm

31:57.450 --> 31:58.917
worried about Mom a little bit  

31:58.985 --> 32:00.352
'cause I'll look online and     

32:00.420 --> 32:01.353
there'll be, like, all these    

32:01.421 --> 32:02.554
pictures of her and Corey.      

32:02.622 --> 32:03.956
Just... she doesn't listen to me

32:04.024 --> 32:05.124
when I'm like, "You know, you   

32:05.191 --> 32:06.959
should really take it slow."    

32:07.027 --> 32:07.960
>> SCOTT: Didn't you get married

32:08.028 --> 32:09.028
both times after a couple       

32:09.095 --> 32:10.996
months?                         

32:11.064 --> 32:11.997
>> KHLOE: There's something a   

32:12.065 --> 32:13.999
little awkward happening.       

32:14.067 --> 32:15.034
>> SCOTT: I heard he's ghost    

32:15.101 --> 32:16.735
riding her whips around town.   

32:16.803 --> 32:18.337
>> KIM: Ugh, the thought of it. 

32:18.405 --> 32:19.338
>> SCOTT: Oh, by the way, not   

32:19.406 --> 32:20.339
only once in a night-- he goes  

32:20.407 --> 32:20.906
for double-decker sometimes.    

32:20.974 --> 32:21.573
Kim told me he went in          

32:21.641 --> 32:22.341
for seconds.                    

32:22.409 --> 32:23.342
>> KHLOE: First of all, it's    

32:23.410 --> 32:24.343
disgusting.                     

32:24.411 --> 32:25.344
I don't need to hear the noises 

32:25.412 --> 32:26.345
that...                         

32:26.413 --> 32:27.346
>> SCOTT: She lives underneath  

32:27.414 --> 32:28.347
them!                           

32:28.415 --> 32:29.348
>> KHLOE: And she tells me about

32:29.416 --> 32:30.482
the squeaking and whatever.     

32:30.550 --> 32:31.483
That's disgusting.              

32:31.551 --> 32:32.484
>> SCOTT: And he comes back for 

32:32.552 --> 32:33.485
seconds, too.                   

32:33.553 --> 32:34.520
>> KIM: Boom. And the bed, like,

32:34.587 --> 32:35.587
bangs up against the wall.      

32:35.655 --> 32:36.588
>> SCOTT: Pa, pa, pa, pa, pa.   

32:36.656 --> 32:37.589
>> KIM: And I, like, was        

32:37.657 --> 32:38.791
literally trying to pass out,   

32:38.858 --> 32:40.492
and I, like, woke up and I swear

32:40.560 --> 32:42.661
I thought I heard moaning and   

32:42.729 --> 32:44.096
I'm like, "Please go to bed!"   

32:44.164 --> 32:45.097
Like, I put the covers over my  

32:45.165 --> 32:46.098
head.                           

32:46.166 --> 32:47.099
>> KHLOE: That's disgusting.    

32:47.167 --> 32:48.600
I have the worst visual.        

32:48.668 --> 32:49.802
>> KIM: My mom has been out of  

32:49.869 --> 32:51.437
the dating game for decades, so 

32:51.504 --> 32:53.138
I want her to have fun again,   

32:53.206 --> 32:54.873
to meet someone, and... I just  

32:54.941 --> 32:56.141
hope that my mom really thinks  

32:56.209 --> 32:57.876
things through because I just   

32:57.944 --> 32:59.111
don't want her to rush into     

32:59.179 --> 33:00.612
anything.                       

33:00.680 --> 33:01.647
>> SCOTT: Out of all the people 

33:01.715 --> 33:03.082
in the world, though, how does  

33:03.149 --> 33:05.584
your mom decide to date a       

33:05.652 --> 33:07.486
32-year-old guy?                

33:07.554 --> 33:08.487
>> KOURTNEY: He's younger than  

33:08.555 --> 33:09.488
Kim and Kourtney.               

33:09.556 --> 33:10.622
>> SCOTT: He's my age, pretty   

33:10.690 --> 33:11.824
much.                           

33:11.891 --> 33:13.792
>> KHLOE: It's creepy.          

33:21.835 --> 33:22.968
>> KIM: Mom.                    

33:23.036 --> 33:24.536
>> KRIS: Hi, doll.              

33:24.604 --> 33:26.038
Welcome to my studio.           

33:26.106 --> 33:27.339
>> KIM: What is this?           

33:27.407 --> 33:28.374
>> KRIS: It's just Kylie's      

33:28.441 --> 33:30.909
world, and I'm living in it.    

33:30.977 --> 33:34.346
I asked her to set up her studio

33:34.414 --> 33:35.781
for a YouTube channel.          

33:35.849 --> 33:37.316
She took over my entire office, 

33:37.384 --> 33:38.317
so I'm slowly being...          

33:38.385 --> 33:39.318
>> KIM: I mean, this lighting is

33:39.386 --> 33:40.319
amazing though.                 

33:40.387 --> 33:41.320
I need this.                    

33:41.388 --> 33:42.454
>> KRIS: Can I read you a little

33:42.522 --> 33:44.056
letter that I received via      

33:44.124 --> 33:45.958
registered mail today?          

33:46.026 --> 33:48.093
To you.                         

33:48.161 --> 33:49.495
>> KIM: To me?                  

33:49.562 --> 33:50.763
>> KRIS: "This is a cease and   

33:50.830 --> 33:53.198
desist for the Kim Kardashian   

33:53.266 --> 33:54.733
West video game."               

33:54.801 --> 33:55.734
>> KIM: What?                   

33:55.802 --> 33:57.336
>> KRIS: "This cease and desist 

33:57.404 --> 33:58.671
order is to inform you that your

33:58.738 --> 34:00.339
persistent actions, including   

34:00.407 --> 34:02.241
but not limited to asking me to 

34:02.308 --> 34:03.342
sign over the rights for you to 

34:03.410 --> 34:04.543
use my likeness, have become    

34:04.611 --> 34:06.011
unbearable.                     

34:06.079 --> 34:07.646
You are ordered to stop such    

34:07.714 --> 34:09.681
activities immediately, as they 

34:09.748 --> 34:11.050
are being done in violation of  

34:11.117 --> 34:12.150
the law."                       

34:12.217 --> 34:13.152
>> KIM: Who is that from?       

34:13.219 --> 34:16.155
>> KRIS: Kourtney Kardashian.   

34:16.222 --> 34:17.322
"I have the right to remain free

34:17.389 --> 34:18.322
from these activities..."       

34:18.391 --> 34:20.726
>> KIM: Stop. Stop.             

34:20.793 --> 34:21.726
Is this a joke?                 

34:21.795 --> 34:22.728
>> KRIS: "...and I do not give  

34:22.795 --> 34:23.728
you any rights.                 

34:23.797 --> 34:24.730
I will pursue any legal remedies

34:24.797 --> 34:26.231
available..."                   

34:26.299 --> 34:28.000
Your sister is serious.         

34:28.068 --> 34:29.001
>> KIM: How do I work this      

34:29.069 --> 34:30.168
thing?                          

34:30.235 --> 34:31.170
(keypad beeping)                

34:31.237 --> 34:33.237
(line ringing)                  

34:33.306 --> 34:34.273
>> KOURTNEY: Hello.             

34:34.341 --> 34:35.274
>> KIM: Is this a joke that     

34:35.342 --> 34:36.275
you're-you're sending me...     

34:36.342 --> 34:37.275
>> KOURTNEY: What?              

34:37.344 --> 34:38.277
>> KIM: ...a cease-and-desist   

34:38.344 --> 34:39.277
letter?                         

34:39.346 --> 34:40.112
>> KOURTNEY: I'm just protecting

34:40.179 --> 34:41.112
myself.                         

34:41.181 --> 34:42.047
Now you know what it's like to  

34:42.114 --> 34:43.215
get some legal paperwork.       

34:43.283 --> 34:44.049
>> KIM: Why are you being so    

34:44.117 --> 34:45.050
difficult?                      

34:45.118 --> 34:46.051
>> KRIS: Kourtney...            

34:46.119 --> 34:46.918
>> KIM: It's like Obama has a   

34:46.985 --> 34:48.187
character, and Kourtney         

34:48.254 --> 34:50.356
Kardashian is being difficult?  

34:50.422 --> 34:52.091
>> KRIS: Kourtney, maybe you can

34:52.158 --> 34:53.192
tell her what would make you    

34:53.259 --> 34:54.293
happy, honey.                   

34:54.360 --> 34:55.627
Looking at it from both sides,  

34:55.695 --> 34:56.628
I feel like you should...       

34:56.696 --> 34:57.629
>> KIM: They...                 

34:57.697 --> 34:58.464
>> KRIS: ...definitely offer her

34:58.531 --> 34:59.465
compensation to be in your game 

34:59.532 --> 35:00.566
because she is a public...      

35:00.633 --> 35:01.400
>> KOURTNEY: That's not what    

35:01.468 --> 35:02.401
it's about.                     

35:02.469 --> 35:03.235
>> KRIS: Okay, tell us what it's

35:03.303 --> 35:04.236
about.                          

35:04.304 --> 35:05.070
>> KOURTNEY: You never asked as 

35:05.138 --> 35:06.638
a favor, never once.            

35:06.706 --> 35:08.574
>> KRIS: So, I feel like she... 

35:08.641 --> 35:10.175
what she's saying to you is she 

35:10.243 --> 35:11.610
doesn't like your approach.     

35:11.678 --> 35:13.012
Why don't we do this?           

35:13.079 --> 35:14.613
Why don't you decide, Kourtney, 

35:14.681 --> 35:16.248
if you would agree to be in her 

35:16.316 --> 35:17.950
game, and how you would want    

35:18.018 --> 35:19.752
your character to be presented? 

35:19.819 --> 35:21.086
Give a little thought to that,  

35:21.154 --> 35:22.087
quickly...                      

35:22.155 --> 35:23.088
>> KIM: I'm so over this.       

35:23.156 --> 35:24.089
>> KRIS: ...so that we can make 

35:24.157 --> 35:25.090
sure that you are-are...        

35:25.158 --> 35:26.091
>> KIM: What's wrong with her?  

35:26.159 --> 35:27.159
>> KOURTNEY: I'm trying to pick 

35:27.227 --> 35:29.495
a Jack Skellington cake, so I   

35:29.562 --> 35:30.863
have to go.                     

35:30.930 --> 35:33.565
>> KRIS: Oh...                  

35:33.633 --> 35:34.566
Oh.                             

35:34.634 --> 35:35.567
>> KIM: No,<i> we</i> have to go.      

35:35.635 --> 35:38.037
She's trying to hang up on us?  

35:38.104 --> 35:39.238
No.                             

35:39.305 --> 35:40.572
She sent the letter, we hang up 

35:40.640 --> 35:41.674
on her.                         

35:41.741 --> 35:43.742
>> KRIS: I think you should have

35:43.810 --> 35:45.044
a little chat with Kourtney,    

35:45.111 --> 35:46.111
because she is going to have a  

35:46.179 --> 35:47.112
baby very soon, and she's       

35:47.180 --> 35:49.615
probably got raging hormones and

35:49.683 --> 35:51.050
very emotional.                 

35:51.117 --> 35:52.284
You can talk to her and be a    

35:52.352 --> 35:53.919
little kinder, more sensitive to

35:53.987 --> 35:55.387
what she's going through, and   

35:55.455 --> 35:59.124
voila-- life is beautiful.      

36:01.928 --> 36:04.830
(applause and cheering)         

36:06.099 --> 36:07.166
>> KIM: They're actually kind of

36:07.233 --> 36:08.600
cute together.                  

36:08.668 --> 36:10.269
(applause and cheering)         

36:10.337 --> 36:11.270
>> KHLOE: You're going to the   

36:11.338 --> 36:12.271
wedding with Corey?             

36:12.339 --> 36:13.272
>> KRIS: Mm-hmm.                

36:13.340 --> 36:14.273
>> KHLOE: Doesn't that send     

36:14.341 --> 36:15.274
mixed signals?                  

36:15.342 --> 36:16.275
>> KRIS: I am... I think I know 

36:16.343 --> 36:17.276
what I'm doing.                 

36:17.344 --> 36:18.143
>> KHLOE: You just tell me it's 

36:18.211 --> 36:19.144
not your boyfriend, but you're  

36:19.212 --> 36:20.779
with him all the time.          

36:20.847 --> 36:21.780
>> KRIS: I don't really care    

36:21.848 --> 36:22.781
what anybody else thinks        

36:22.849 --> 36:24.750
anymore.                        

36:34.961 --> 36:37.196
>> KIM: Hello?                  

36:37.263 --> 36:40.165
Kourt?                          

36:42.936 --> 36:45.070
Ooh, what did she make?         

36:45.138 --> 36:46.305
Sugar cookies?                  

36:46.373 --> 36:47.706
>> KOURTNEY: What are you doing 

36:47.774 --> 36:48.707
here?                           

36:48.775 --> 36:52.444
>> KIM: Hey.                    

36:52.512 --> 36:53.979
Are you ignoring me?            

36:54.047 --> 36:55.214
>> KOURTNEY: No.                

36:55.281 --> 36:58.684
>> KIM: I came over to...       

36:58.752 --> 37:01.720
basically tell you that I spoke 

37:01.788 --> 37:03.255
to my video game people, and    

37:03.323 --> 37:04.790
we...                           

37:04.858 --> 37:06.225
You know, I have a fee for you, 

37:06.292 --> 37:07.259
and I know it's not about the   

37:07.327 --> 37:08.260
fee.                            

37:08.328 --> 37:09.661
I get what it's about.          

37:09.729 --> 37:10.829
Like, I should have, like, asked

37:10.897 --> 37:13.799
and not assumed.                

37:15.402 --> 37:16.468
My mom was right.               

37:16.536 --> 37:17.803
Maybe I didn't have the best    

37:17.871 --> 37:19.304
approach with Kourtney.         

37:19.372 --> 37:21.740
I mean, she's hormonal and all. 

37:21.808 --> 37:23.742
So, hopefully, this approach    

37:23.810 --> 37:24.843
will work better.               

37:24.911 --> 37:26.478
I would really like you to do it

37:26.546 --> 37:28.047
for me, as a favor.             

37:28.114 --> 37:29.048
>> KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm.            

37:29.115 --> 37:30.049
>> KIM: But I know you're not   

37:30.116 --> 37:31.483
into being in a video game, but 

37:31.551 --> 37:32.484
I really...                     

37:32.552 --> 37:33.585
>> KOURTNEY: Well, you did make 

37:33.653 --> 37:34.586
my career.                      

37:34.654 --> 37:35.587
Nobody...                       

37:35.655 --> 37:37.523
>> KIM: Without everyone,       

37:37.590 --> 37:38.524
we wouldn't be here.            

37:38.591 --> 37:39.525
That's why it works.            

37:39.592 --> 37:40.526
>> KOURTNEY: Right.             

37:40.593 --> 37:41.527
>> KIM: 'Cause we're all here   

37:41.594 --> 37:42.528
together.                       

37:42.595 --> 37:43.629
Of course if you guys had a     

37:43.697 --> 37:44.630
project you were really         

37:44.698 --> 37:45.631
passionate about and excited    

37:45.699 --> 37:47.800
about, we would all, like, help.

37:47.867 --> 37:49.001
>> KOURTNEY: Well, I appreciate 

37:49.069 --> 37:51.203
the apology, and I'm happy to do

37:51.271 --> 37:52.504
it.                             

37:52.572 --> 37:54.640
>> KIM: Thank you.              

37:54.708 --> 37:56.642
I'll get your check over ASAP.  

37:56.710 --> 37:57.643
>> KOURTNEY: It's not about the 

37:57.711 --> 37:58.644
check.                          

37:58.712 --> 37:59.645
>> KIM: It is, though.          

37:59.713 --> 38:00.646
>> KOURTNEY: No, it's actually  

38:00.714 --> 38:01.647
not.                            

38:01.715 --> 38:02.648
>> KIM: Come on, it is.         

38:02.716 --> 38:05.784
>> KOURTNEY: It's not.          

38:13.593 --> 38:14.526
>> KHLOE: Well, well, well,     

38:14.594 --> 38:15.527
you're...                       

38:15.595 --> 38:16.528
>> KIM: What are you wearing?   

38:16.596 --> 38:17.863
>> KHLOE: What are you (bleep)  

38:17.931 --> 38:18.931
wearing, first of all?          

38:18.998 --> 38:20.799
All you do is wear whole clothes

38:20.867 --> 38:21.800
with a...                       

38:21.868 --> 38:22.835
>> KIM: Looks like a gown.      

38:22.902 --> 38:24.036
>> KHLOE: It's actually a robe, 

38:24.104 --> 38:25.571
you dumb (bleep), so get over   

38:25.638 --> 38:26.572
yourself.                       

38:26.639 --> 38:27.906
>> KIM: You're so pleasant.     

38:27.974 --> 38:29.742
I'm so glad I came over.        

38:29.809 --> 38:31.276
(phone blips)                   

38:31.344 --> 38:32.277
>> KRIS: He wants me to help him

38:32.345 --> 38:34.346
pick out a pair of shoes.       

38:34.414 --> 38:35.347
>> KIM: The velvet.             

38:35.415 --> 38:36.815
>> KRIS: They're cute, right?   

38:36.883 --> 38:37.983
>> KHLOE: Corey wants you to    

38:38.051 --> 38:38.984
pick out a pair of shoes?       

38:39.052 --> 38:39.985
Why?                            

38:40.053 --> 38:40.986
>> KRIS: Because we're going to 

38:41.054 --> 38:41.987
a wedding.                      

38:42.055 --> 38:42.988
>> KHLOE: Who is?               

38:43.056 --> 38:44.023
>> KIM: Whose wedding?          

38:44.090 --> 38:45.891
>> KRIS: Lance Bass.            

38:45.959 --> 38:47.893
>> KHLOE: You're going to the   

38:47.961 --> 38:48.894
wedding <i> with</i> Corey?             

38:48.962 --> 38:49.895
>> KRIS: Mm-hmm.                

38:49.963 --> 38:50.929
>> KHLOE: Doesn't that send     

38:50.997 --> 38:51.930
mixed signals?                  

38:51.998 --> 38:53.766
Someone you're not dating?      

38:53.833 --> 38:57.102
>> KRIS: Uh, it's a date to a   

38:57.170 --> 38:58.103
wedding.                        

38:58.171 --> 38:59.104
I'm not getting married.        

38:59.172 --> 39:00.105
>> KHLOE: You don't bring       

39:00.173 --> 39:01.040
someone to a wedding if you're  

39:01.107 --> 39:02.041
really not serious with them.   

39:02.108 --> 39:03.042
>> KRIS: I-I think I know what  

39:03.109 --> 39:04.043
I'm doing.                      

39:04.110 --> 39:04.877
>> KHLOE: You just tell me it's 

39:04.944 --> 39:05.778
not your boyfriend, but you're  

39:05.845 --> 39:06.779
with him all the time.          

39:06.846 --> 39:07.780
I don't care if it is.          

39:07.847 --> 39:09.648
Just take ownership.            

39:09.716 --> 39:10.683
>> KRIS: I cannot do anything   

39:10.750 --> 39:12.685
right.                          

39:12.752 --> 39:13.686
>> KHLOE: You got that hickey   

39:13.753 --> 39:14.687
right, though.                  

39:14.754 --> 39:15.688
(all laughing quietly)          

39:15.755 --> 39:17.856
>> KRIS: It's not a hickey.     

39:17.924 --> 39:19.291
>> KHLOE: Apparently, it is.    

39:19.359 --> 39:20.292
>> KRIS: I don't know the rules 

39:20.360 --> 39:21.293
of dating.                      

39:21.361 --> 39:22.361
Maybe somebody should fill me in

39:22.429 --> 39:23.429
and tell me, like, what you're  

39:23.496 --> 39:24.430
supposed to do.                 

39:24.497 --> 39:25.431
I haven't dated anybody in 25   

39:25.498 --> 39:26.432
years.                          

39:26.499 --> 39:27.299
>> KHLOE: Well, you said he's   

39:27.367 --> 39:28.300
not your boyfriend, right?      

39:28.368 --> 39:29.301
>> KRIS: I don't really care    

39:29.369 --> 39:30.302
what anybody else thinks        

39:30.370 --> 39:31.303
anymore.                        

39:31.371 --> 39:32.304
>> KIM: Mm.                     

39:32.372 --> 39:33.172
>> KRIS: I just want to be      

39:33.239 --> 39:34.039
happy.... and do my thing.      

39:34.107 --> 39:35.040
>> KIM: Mm-hmm.                 

39:35.108 --> 39:35.874
>> KRIS: And have people leave  

39:35.942 --> 39:36.875
me alone.                       

39:36.943 --> 39:37.876
>> KIM: Do you, boo.            

39:37.944 --> 39:38.877
Do... you.                      

39:38.945 --> 39:39.878
>> KHLOE: Mm-hmm.               

39:39.946 --> 39:40.746
>> KRIS: It's kind of hard to do

39:40.814 --> 39:43.782
you when everyone's a critic... 

39:43.850 --> 39:46.952
and telling me how to do me.    

39:47.020 --> 39:48.987
It's so annoying that my own    

39:49.055 --> 39:51.557
family is being so judgmental,  

39:51.624 --> 39:53.225
because all I really want to do 

39:53.293 --> 39:57.830
is live my life.                

40:02.535 --> 40:03.702
>> KRIS: I can't do anything    

40:03.770 --> 40:05.738
without getting criticized.     

40:05.805 --> 40:07.740
It's-it's uncomfortable.        

40:07.807 --> 40:08.841
It's like everybody wants       

40:08.908 --> 40:10.142
answers, everybody wants to know

40:10.210 --> 40:11.043
what the title is.              

40:11.111 --> 40:12.811
It's like you're a bunch of     

40:12.879 --> 40:15.814
haters.                         

40:15.882 --> 40:17.716
>> KHLOE: I feel really bad that

40:17.784 --> 40:19.151
my mom feels unsupported by all 

40:19.219 --> 40:20.519
of her kids.                    

40:20.587 --> 40:22.187
I mean, the truth is, I think   

40:22.255 --> 40:23.155
we're all really protective of  

40:23.223 --> 40:24.156
her.                            

40:24.224 --> 40:25.290
I think at the end of the day,  

40:25.358 --> 40:26.925
we all want her to be happy, and

40:26.993 --> 40:28.093
if she is, then we're happy for 

40:28.161 --> 40:29.094
her.                            

40:29.162 --> 40:30.329
Mom, we're not hating on you.   

40:30.397 --> 40:31.563
We just want you to be happy and

40:31.631 --> 40:33.799
have fun.                       

40:33.867 --> 40:35.434
Well, how would you do you?     

40:35.502 --> 40:36.435
>> KRIS: I don't know.          

40:36.503 --> 40:38.270
I'm just getting my sea legs.   

40:38.338 --> 40:39.638
I don't know how to do me.      

40:39.706 --> 40:40.939
I'm figuring it out one day     

40:41.007 --> 40:41.940
at a time.                      

40:42.008 --> 40:43.008
>> KIM: We just want you to be  

40:43.076 --> 40:46.278
happy... and have fun.          

40:46.346 --> 40:49.248
Life is about having fun.       

41:05.899 --> 41:08.567
(happy chatter, whooping)       

41:08.635 --> 41:10.703
>> KRIS: We're in Vegas, and I'm

41:10.770 --> 41:11.870
really excited.                 

41:11.938 --> 41:13.272
Getting back out there in the   

41:13.340 --> 41:16.108
dating world is going to be very

41:16.176 --> 41:18.177
interesting, and hopefully,     

41:18.244 --> 41:20.145
a lot of fun.                   

41:21.548 --> 41:22.481
>> COREY: How y'all doin'?      

41:22.549 --> 41:23.482
>> WOMAN: Hi!                   

41:23.550 --> 41:24.683
>> KRIS: Hi, baby.              

41:24.751 --> 41:26.685
Mwah! How are you?              

41:26.753 --> 41:27.786
>> KRIS: Wait. Khloe, pull that 

41:27.854 --> 41:28.787
down.                           

41:28.855 --> 41:29.788
There's a lot of shadows going  

41:29.856 --> 41:30.789
on there.                       

41:30.857 --> 41:31.924
>> KHLOE: A lot of shadows?     

41:31.991 --> 41:33.859
My (bleep) is coming out.       

41:33.927 --> 41:34.893
That's the shadow you see.      

41:34.961 --> 41:37.529
(laughter)                      

41:37.597 --> 41:38.831
>> KRIS: You guys, who remembers

41:38.898 --> 41:39.832
the night I was doing the keg   

41:39.899 --> 41:40.833
upside down?                    

41:40.900 --> 41:41.834
>> WOMAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah,     

41:41.901 --> 41:42.835
yeah.                           

41:42.902 --> 41:43.836
>> MAN: Oh, yes!                

41:43.903 --> 41:44.837
>> MAN 2: Yeah.                 

41:44.904 --> 41:45.938
>> KRIS: Yeah, and somebody     

41:46.006 --> 41:47.039
talked me into standing on my   

41:47.107 --> 41:48.040
head...                         

41:48.108 --> 41:49.041
>> WOMAN: Oh, my God.           

41:49.109 --> 41:50.042
>> KRIS: ...and sucking down    

41:50.110 --> 41:51.276
beers hard as I could.          

41:51.344 --> 41:53.012
(laughter)                      

41:53.079 --> 41:56.281
The (bleep) you guys make me do.

41:56.349 --> 41:57.282
You guys didn't know I was so   

41:57.350 --> 41:58.417
limber, did you?                

41:58.485 --> 42:00.019
>> KHLOE: My mom really does    

42:00.086 --> 42:02.888
seem so happy, and she's smiling

42:02.956 --> 42:03.922
from ear to ear.                

42:03.990 --> 42:06.592
(whooping and applause)         

42:06.659 --> 42:07.760
She really can't worry about    

42:07.827 --> 42:09.294
what everybody has to say,      

42:09.362 --> 42:11.263
'cause people are always going  

42:11.331 --> 42:12.264
to have an opinion.             

42:12.332 --> 42:13.332
And just like (bleep), everybody

42:13.400 --> 42:15.601
has one.                        

42:15.669 --> 42:16.602
(applause and cheering)         

42:16.670 --> 42:19.605
(camera shutters clicking)      

42:26.746 --> 42:29.748
(applause and cheering)         

42:29.816 --> 42:32.718
(dance music playing)           

42:34.521 --> 42:37.423
(applause and cheering)         

42:39.793 --> 42:41.126
>> KIM: They're actually kind of

42:41.194 --> 42:42.728
cute together.                  

42:42.796 --> 42:46.832
>> COREY: I'm a lucky (bleep).  

42:46.900 --> 42:48.767
>> KHLOE: Ultimately, I'm just  

42:48.835 --> 42:50.302
happy if my mom's happy, and    

42:50.370 --> 42:51.937
based off of tonight and seeing 

42:52.005 --> 42:54.406
how my mom is dancing and just, 

42:54.474 --> 42:55.841
like, getting her groove on, I  

42:55.909 --> 42:58.310
am happy for her.               

42:58.378 --> 43:01.613
(applause and cheering)         

43:04.317 --> 43:05.250
>> KRIS: Tip your head over     

43:05.318 --> 43:06.251
like...                         

43:06.319 --> 43:07.252
Are you watching?               

43:07.320 --> 43:08.253
>> KIM: On the next <i> Keeping Up</i>  

43:08.321 --> 43:09.254
<i>with the Kardashians...</i>         

43:09.322 --> 43:10.723
>> KIM: That's disgusting.      

43:10.790 --> 43:11.724
>> KRIS: Good as new.           

43:11.791 --> 43:12.725
>> WOMAN: Do you have a will or 

43:12.792 --> 43:13.492
a trust?
