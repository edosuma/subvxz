01:06.766 --> 01:08.889
High above the city,

01:08.891 --> 01:13.391
on a tall column,
stood the statue of the Happy Prince.

01:14.850 --> 01:19.225
He was gilded all over
with thin leaves of fine gold.

01:20.100 --> 01:22.973
For eyes, he had two bright sapphires,

01:22.975 --> 01:26.141
and a large red ruby glowed
on his sword-hilt.

01:27.058 --> 01:29.141
He was very much admired indeed.

01:29.766 --> 01:34.100
One night, there flew over the city
a little swallow.

01:35.100 --> 01:38.933
His friends had gone away to Egypt
six weeks before...

01:39.391 --> 01:41.058
but he had stayed behind.

01:42.141 --> 01:43.264
Where shall I...?

01:43.266 --> 01:47.139
All the next day,
he sat on the Prince's shoulder

01:47.141 --> 01:50.850
and told him storeys of things
he had seen in strange lands.

01:51.600 --> 01:55.725
Of the red ibises who stand
in long rows on the banks of the Nile...

01:56.350 --> 01:58.306
and catch goldfish in their beaks.

02:00.308 --> 02:04.933
Of the King of the Mountains of the Moon,
who is as black as ebony...

02:06.183 --> 02:08.265
and worships a large crystal.

02:10.225 --> 02:13.600
"Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow",
said the Happy Prince.

02:14.558 --> 02:16.891
"You tell me of marvellous things.

02:18.558 --> 02:21.141
But more marvellous than this...

02:21.683 --> 02:25.600
is the suffering of men and women.

02:27.225 --> 02:30.391
There is no mystery so great as suffering.

02:31.683 --> 02:33.933
Fly over my city, little Swallow...

02:35.016 --> 02:36.766
and tell me what you see there."

02:40.933 --> 02:43.183
So the Swallow flew over the great city...

02:43.641 --> 02:47.475
and saw the rich making merry
in their beautiful houses...

02:48.683 --> 02:51.350
while the white faces of starving children

02:51.891 --> 02:55.016
looked out listlessly
at the black streets.

02:56.975 --> 02:59.556
At a table sat a broken man,

02:59.558 --> 03:02.266
a bunch of withered violets by his side.

03:05.683 --> 03:06.933
He was a writer.

03:09.183 --> 03:11.891
But he was too cold to finish his play.

03:13.641 --> 03:14.933
It's a dream.

03:34.308 --> 03:35.766
I rather agree with you.

03:37.225 --> 03:39.014
Absolutely extraordinary!

03:39.016 --> 03:41.223
- It was very good bottle.
- Lovely place too!

03:41.225 --> 03:44.556
I tell you what. When we're next in
London, will you come to the club? Hmm?

03:44.558 --> 03:46.223
I'd love to! Which one?

03:46.225 --> 03:49.056
- Um... The Carlton.
- Oh, marvellous!

03:49.058 --> 03:50.850
- Never seen a man eat so...
- I...

03:51.308 --> 03:54.433
- What is it, my dear?
- I, I think I left my fan.

03:56.850 --> 03:58.100
Is she all right?

04:24.808 --> 04:25.850
Mr Wilde!

04:28.141 --> 04:29.016
Mr Wilde?

04:33.683 --> 04:36.100
- Madam.
- Surely you remember me.

04:37.308 --> 04:38.641
It's Mrs Arbuthnot.

04:40.600 --> 04:42.806
I came to all your first nights.

04:42.808 --> 04:44.516
Of course, madam.

04:45.308 --> 04:47.308
One never forgets such a face.

04:48.391 --> 04:50.141
How kind of you to speak to me.

04:50.891 --> 04:53.808
- You are well, I see.
- Very well, sir.

04:55.308 --> 04:57.056
- How are you?
- Oh...

04:57.058 --> 04:59.308
Lydia! Come here immediately!

05:00.391 --> 05:01.391
I have to go.

05:02.725 --> 05:04.391
You couldn't lend me £5, could you?

05:05.975 --> 05:09.473
Things are a little tight at present.
I feel ghastly asking like this but...

05:09.475 --> 05:11.266
- Lydia!
- I'm coming!

05:13.516 --> 05:14.975
Mr Wilde, I...

05:16.933 --> 05:19.014
I... just wish...

05:19.016 --> 05:21.933
Never wish, madam. It might come true.

05:22.766 --> 05:27.100
But thank you... for a moment's harmony
in a discordant fugue.

05:28.266 --> 05:29.683
Go back to Jeffrey at once.

05:36.558 --> 05:39.806
If you ever speak to my wife again,
I'll kill you. Do you hear me?

07:00.725 --> 07:02.100
Five pounds.

07:32.100 --> 07:37.973
See, see, my Christ blood streams

07:37.975 --> 07:39.266
through the firmament.

08:11.391 --> 08:12.558
I'm coming.

10:06.100 --> 10:10.183
Shrouded in the symphony
of adjacent copulation.

10:30.433 --> 10:31.266
Ow!

10:39.725 --> 10:40.725
Thanks.

10:47.475 --> 10:48.683
For that.

11:03.141 --> 11:04.225
Sit down.

12:03.391 --> 12:05.475
My dear Boudicca.

12:25.058 --> 12:25.933
Please!

12:32.558 --> 12:33.808
Garçon.

12:35.600 --> 12:37.225
Very well, sir.

12:37.850 --> 12:39.100
And for you, sirs?

12:58.975 --> 13:00.723
Ooh, Maurice.

13:00.725 --> 13:02.891
Maurice! Maurice!

13:04.391 --> 13:05.225
Maurice!

13:13.641 --> 13:14.641
Oscar!

13:16.600 --> 13:17.433
Brother.

14:13.183 --> 14:14.391
Shut up.

14:44.475 --> 14:46.348
♩ I'm a young girl ♩

14:48.058 --> 14:50.516
♩ And I just come over ♩

14:51.350 --> 14:54.639
♩ Over from the country
Where they do things big ♩

14:56.891 --> 15:01.266
♩ And amongst the boys I've got a lover ♩

15:01.725 --> 15:07.056
♩ And since I've got a lover

15:09.433 --> 15:13.600
♩ The boy I love ♩

♩ Is up in the gallery ♩

15:17.766 --> 15:22.889

15:22.891 --> 15:26.764

15:26.766 --> 15:30.016
♩ Waving his handkerchief ♩

15:31.183 --> 15:34.139

15:34.141 --> 15:37.058
♩ That lives on the leaf ♩

15:41.808 --> 15:46.473

16:00.308 --> 16:05.139

16:16.225 --> 16:18.806

♩ As merry as a cricket ♩

16:21.266 --> 16:25.681
♩ That lives on the leaf ♩

16:42.641 --> 16:43.766
The actors...

16:45.308 --> 16:48.308
have given a charming rendering
of a delightful play.

16:50.641 --> 16:54.306
Your appreciation is most intelligent.

16:54.308 --> 16:57.933
I congratulate you
on the success of your performance.

16:59.475 --> 17:03.475
Which persuades me that you think
almost as highly of the play...

17:04.183 --> 17:05.598
as I do myself.

17:09.308 --> 17:10.391
Oscar Wilde.

17:10.933 --> 17:15.138
The crime of which
you have been convicted is so bad

17:15.141 --> 17:17.888
that one has to put the sternest restraint

17:17.891 --> 17:20.888
upon oneself
from describing the sentiments,

17:20.891 --> 17:25.433
which must rise to the breast
of every man of honour.

17:27.349 --> 17:29.598
It is no use to address you.

17:29.600 --> 17:33.683
People who do these things must be dead
to all sense of shame.

17:33.975 --> 17:36.223
I shall, under such circumstances,

17:36.225 --> 17:40.766
be expected to pass
the severest sentence that the law allows.

17:41.266 --> 17:44.598
The sentence of the court
is that you be imprisoned

17:44.600 --> 17:48.391
and kept to hard labour for two years.

18:28.391 --> 18:29.308
Robbie.

18:30.683 --> 18:32.891
My lonely rider of the Apocalypse.

18:34.100 --> 18:36.391
You took me into exile, dear boy.

18:37.891 --> 18:39.681
Where will you take me now?

18:39.683 --> 18:41.475
- I'm not taking you anywhere.
- What?

18:42.141 --> 18:44.473
What ship? Ireland, you say?

18:44.475 --> 18:45.725
No ships, Oscar.

18:46.475 --> 18:49.014
I'm here in Paris. I have your allowance.

18:49.016 --> 18:52.058
Oh, good. I have been dinnerless.

18:56.141 --> 18:58.891
I'm in mortal combat
with this wallpaper, Robbie.

18:59.391 --> 19:00.933
One of us has to go.

19:01.391 --> 19:03.933
Maurice says you made
quite a scene last night.

19:05.266 --> 19:07.681
It's more or less impossible
to make good scenes

19:07.683 --> 19:10.225
in such reduced circumstances as mine.

19:10.891 --> 19:12.516
But I believe I did my best.

19:13.016 --> 19:16.931
Last night,
I dreamed I was dining with the dead.

19:16.933 --> 19:19.475
You must've been
the life and soul of the party, Oscar.

19:21.225 --> 19:23.350
- What is this?
- Morphia.

19:24.475 --> 19:26.058
I am much distracted, dear boy.

19:26.683 --> 19:31.141
I've had a very bad time lately.
For two days, not a penny in my pocket.

19:31.975 --> 19:34.600
So I had to wander around,
filled with wild longings,

19:34.933 --> 19:37.308
trapped in the circle of boulevards.

19:37.933 --> 19:40.183
One of the worst in the Inferno.

19:42.141 --> 19:44.225
Jumping off tables at your age.

19:49.266 --> 19:50.889
What do you think, doctor?

19:50.891 --> 19:52.973
The abscess has suppurated.

19:52.975 --> 19:56.183
If things don't improve,
I'm afraid we'll have to operate.

19:57.641 --> 20:02.600
I shall never forget your kindness
when I was released from prison.

20:06.350 --> 20:08.350
What high hopes we had that day.

20:10.016 --> 20:12.350
But I was doomed from the start.

20:13.933 --> 20:16.473
Why does one run towards ruin?

20:18.225 --> 20:20.933
Why does it hold such a fascination?

20:43.225 --> 20:44.141
Oscar!

20:44.641 --> 20:45.600
Robbie!

20:48.975 --> 20:50.766
- Oscar.
- Robbie!

20:54.600 --> 20:56.473
- How are you?
- Where's Reggie?

20:56.475 --> 21:00.014
He's waiting for us at the hotel.
He wanted to make sure there were no...

21:00.016 --> 21:02.058
- What?
- Difficulties.

21:02.558 --> 21:04.598
- Have you got everything?
- No.

21:04.600 --> 21:06.933
I left Oscar Wilde at Newhaven.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.891
And this is the last thing he wrote.

21:10.850 --> 21:12.350
The great letter I told you about.

21:12.891 --> 21:15.139
Make three copies,
send one to Bosie Douglas,

21:15.141 --> 21:18.556
one to me and keep the original
under lock and key.

21:18.558 --> 21:20.431
- Understood?
- Come.

22:14.016 --> 22:15.889
If anyone asks for your papers,

22:15.891 --> 22:17.556
just say they're in your cabin trunk.

22:17.558 --> 22:18.433
What?

22:19.308 --> 22:20.766
Well, well, well.

22:21.725 --> 22:23.431
Sebastian Melmoth.

22:23.433 --> 22:26.516
- Reggie.
- What an absolute joy!

22:27.516 --> 22:30.139
- Your first time in Dieppe, Sebastian?
- Sorry?

22:30.141 --> 22:31.141
What fun.

22:31.600 --> 22:34.181
Let me introduce you immediately
to our good friend, the manager.

22:34.183 --> 22:36.639
Melmoth, meet Monsieur Duroc..

22:36.641 --> 22:39.308
Look after Mr Melmoth, would you?
Best room, and all that.

22:39.725 --> 22:41.475
Well, I'll leave you to it. You lunching?

22:42.016 --> 22:43.641
Er, yes, probably.

23:02.475 --> 23:04.891
- My favourite blue.
- The case is from Reggie.

23:06.933 --> 23:09.764
And here's £800 we raised
while you were in prison.

23:09.766 --> 23:10.681
No!

23:10.683 --> 23:14.389
It'll keep you going until you begin
to work again. Uh! I'll look after this.

23:16.975 --> 23:18.016
Reggie!

23:20.600 --> 23:23.725
Oh, darling Oscar.

23:31.350 --> 23:32.600
How do you like your new name?

23:33.266 --> 23:35.808
Almost as much as I loathe the old one.

23:38.891 --> 23:41.183
Ah! Letters.

23:42.141 --> 23:43.225
And look!

23:43.808 --> 23:46.389
No exiled fairy's trousseau is complete

23:46.391 --> 23:48.600
without a signed portrait
of the great widow herself.

23:49.725 --> 23:52.350
You must dance naked before it
at the Jubilee next month.

23:52.600 --> 23:54.433
- It's from him.
- Oscar?

23:57.975 --> 23:59.723
I may as well tell you both now

23:59.725 --> 24:02.558
that I fully intend
to effect a reconciliation with my wife.

24:03.350 --> 24:04.641
If she will have me.

24:05.433 --> 24:09.600
And rest assured, I shall never see
Lord Alfred Douglas again.

24:10.100 --> 24:12.266
That part of my life is behind me.

24:17.850 --> 24:19.639
No, he was absolutely furious.

24:19.641 --> 24:22.931
- Really?
- Come on, Oscar, that's simply not true.

24:22.933 --> 24:24.556
That's the whole point.

24:24.558 --> 24:28.433
From what you say, Oscar, it would seem
that Reading Gaol is an enchanted castle.

24:28.933 --> 24:30.891
With the governor as its presiding elf.

24:32.558 --> 24:33.433
Robbie...

24:34.433 --> 24:37.223
- I met Christ in prison.
- And what was she in for?

24:37.225 --> 24:40.891
Don't joke, Reggie.
In the cell, there is only God and man.

24:42.016 --> 24:45.433
After three days in hell,
Jesus rose from the dead...

24:46.766 --> 24:47.889
broke open his tomb,

24:47.891 --> 24:52.766
discarded his cerements and took his place
forever in the heart of man.

24:53.808 --> 24:57.808
After 700 days of hard labour,
my tomb is opened.

24:58.058 --> 25:01.514
I have tiptoed to the boat train
and am born again,

25:01.516 --> 25:03.558
through him, with him and in France.

25:05.308 --> 25:07.681
Very good, Oscar.
We'll make a Catholic of you yet.

25:07.683 --> 25:09.891
Only unlike dear Jesus, you have luggage.

25:10.225 --> 25:12.806
And £800 to spend
before your ascension into heaven.

25:12.808 --> 25:14.014
Or purgatory.

25:14.016 --> 25:17.639
I'm afraid a delegation of 15 young poets
are arriving from Paris at the weekend

25:17.641 --> 25:19.431
- to welcome you into exile.
- Oh.

25:19.433 --> 25:21.516
- They're bringing a cheque.
- Oh, good.

25:22.641 --> 25:28.183
All I'm saying, Reggie, dear, is I have
lived in the grip of vice and pleasure.

25:28.891 --> 25:30.641
It was wrong and I have paid.

25:31.391 --> 25:34.641
Perhaps the slate is wiped clean,
perhaps it is not, who knows?

25:35.683 --> 25:39.016
At any rate,
I am now ready to return to life.

26:13.600 --> 26:15.014
You coming down, Oscar?

26:15.016 --> 26:16.850
I need to get my bathing things.

26:49.058 --> 26:54.391
Constance, my dear, good, beautiful wife.

26:56.100 --> 27:00.308
There is nothing I can ever say that will
undo the great hurt I have caused you.

27:01.141 --> 27:02.516
We both know that.

27:03.183 --> 27:06.223
For two years, I have lain on hard boards,

27:06.225 --> 27:11.808
knelt on cold stone, dined on shame
and thought of little else.

27:13.016 --> 27:16.141
You and my sons are the only things
that tie me to life.

27:16.475 --> 27:17.681
I don't know if...

27:17.683 --> 27:20.891
Were it not for the hope
that one day I would meet you all again...

27:21.558 --> 27:23.183
I don't think I could go on.

27:24.641 --> 27:25.973
Good God.

27:25.975 --> 27:29.598
My desire to live,
dearest Constance, is as intense as ever.

27:29.600 --> 27:31.764
Oh, for God's sake.

27:31.766 --> 27:35.806
And though my heart is broken,
hearts are made to be broken.

27:35.808 --> 27:39.016
Waiter, more champagne, please!

27:40.100 --> 27:43.016
That is why
God sends sorrow to the world.

27:43.600 --> 27:49.350
Write to me as soon as you can
and tell me that I am still your Oscar.

28:17.058 --> 28:20.098
Speech! Speech! Speech!

28:20.100 --> 28:23.475
Speech! Speech!

28:30.766 --> 28:33.308
Speech! Speech!

29:36.516 --> 29:40.514
No, to you!
You are really wonderful!

29:40.516 --> 29:41.764
Wonderful!

29:41.766 --> 29:44.100
Come on, boys! Let's have him!

29:56.225 --> 29:57.891
Oh, shot!

30:21.516 --> 30:24.681
You can't bowl!
You just simply can't bowl!

30:24.683 --> 30:25.725
No, you can't.

30:30.350 --> 30:32.431
Get away from me!
I don't want to catch anything.

30:35.141 --> 30:36.473
Er, coffee.

30:36.475 --> 30:38.475
Six café au lait.

30:39.016 --> 30:40.058
Go away.

30:44.141 --> 30:46.725
Not wearing
your silk stockings today, Oscar?

30:49.850 --> 30:53.100
- Darling boy.
- Yes, my Hyacinth.

30:54.516 --> 30:57.808
Oh, remind me to change
the sheets today, darling boy.

30:58.141 --> 30:59.348
Your slim, gilt cheeks

30:59.350 --> 31:02.181
have left a shit stain all the way down
your side of the bed.

31:03.683 --> 31:04.931
You go too far, sir!

31:04.933 --> 31:08.308
No you go too far, madam.

31:08.933 --> 31:12.056
Garçon, there's a piece of shit
on the pavement. Get rid of it!

31:12.058 --> 31:14.350
Oscar! There you are!

31:15.725 --> 31:17.891
We're late. They're waiting for us.

31:31.933 --> 31:33.225
Are you all right, Oscar?

31:33.641 --> 31:34.683
No, not really.

31:35.683 --> 31:36.931
Let's go back to the hotel.

31:40.141 --> 31:41.058
Let's follow them.

31:43.683 --> 31:46.848
Christ, they're following us.

31:46.850 --> 31:50.348
Wait for me! I want to cover you in honey
and lick it off again!

31:50.350 --> 31:51.558
This is intolerable.

31:52.850 --> 31:53.850
This way.

32:04.808 --> 32:06.475
Oh, look! Sticks, sticks!

32:11.058 --> 32:13.141
- This is better than hunting!
- Come on!

32:17.308 --> 32:18.808
Quick! A church!

32:35.058 --> 32:36.808
What's the matter, Oscar?

32:38.683 --> 32:41.848
What more do you want?

32:41.850 --> 32:43.225
What more do you want?

32:44.016 --> 32:45.308
Get your hands off me!

32:45.850 --> 32:48.389
You've taken everything, you little shit!
Everything!

32:48.391 --> 32:51.098
My family, my work, my freedom!
Everything!

32:51.100 --> 32:52.516
There's nothing left to take!

32:53.308 --> 32:57.100
What are you gonna do, kill me?
I'm already dead, you cunt!

32:57.850 --> 32:58.725
Now, go!

32:59.725 --> 33:02.264
The natural habitat of the hypocrite
is England.

33:02.266 --> 33:04.975
Go back there, leave me in peace! Go!

33:23.308 --> 33:24.850
I didn't know you had it in you.

33:28.516 --> 33:29.558
I don't.

33:30.266 --> 33:31.516
I've nothing in me.

33:32.391 --> 33:33.600
Not even fear.

33:42.933 --> 33:46.181
With no warning,
I was transferred one afternoon

33:46.183 --> 33:48.516
from Wandsworth to Reading Gaol.

33:49.725 --> 33:51.764
In broad daylight, by train,

33:51.766 --> 33:54.683
shackled to a warder
like a performing bear.

33:55.933 --> 34:01.766
That journey was the most exquisite of
the tortures Her Majesty contrived for me.

34:03.183 --> 34:06.475
At Clapham Junction,
we had to wait for a connexion.

34:07.308 --> 34:10.433
Half an hour, my dears, on platform two.

34:11.683 --> 34:14.556
Sadly, my public had not forgotten me.

34:16.183 --> 34:19.225
At first, they simply giggled and pointed.

34:20.308 --> 34:21.889
And then a man began to shout.

34:21.891 --> 34:24.473
It's Oscar bleeding Wilde!

34:24.475 --> 34:27.098
He paced up and down,
wagging his finger...

34:27.100 --> 34:28.181
Backs to the wall, boys!

34:28.183 --> 34:32.764
...as he catalogued my crimes
to his growing and spellbound audience.

34:32.766 --> 34:36.725
We don't want any of that love,
but don't speak its moniker here!

34:36.933 --> 34:40.975
At each twist,
they moaned and swayed as one...

34:41.391 --> 34:44.808
spitting and screaming,
hungering for my blood.

34:45.850 --> 34:46.766
And I...

34:49.183 --> 34:50.433
I saw the future.

34:52.516 --> 34:54.600
It was the end of all peace.

34:57.725 --> 34:59.391
I shall see it on my deathbed.

35:16.225 --> 35:18.558
Oh, dear. It's from the Chief of Police.

35:19.141 --> 35:20.183
You read it.

35:21.808 --> 35:24.600
It seems he's to be deported
if his behaviour doesn't improve.

35:24.933 --> 35:28.181
Our celebration of young French poets
didn't go down very well in the voisinage.

35:28.183 --> 35:29.848
Well, for God's sake, don't tell him now.

35:29.850 --> 35:32.516
In his current mood,
he's likely to set fire to the hotel.

35:33.141 --> 35:34.641
Thank Christ I'm leaving tomorrow.

35:37.641 --> 35:38.600
Be careful, Robbie.

35:39.475 --> 35:40.558
He'll eat you.

35:41.766 --> 35:42.850
Can't help it.

35:44.891 --> 35:46.100
Goodnight, dear boy.

36:33.600 --> 36:35.141
I read your letter from prison.

36:37.725 --> 36:39.266
It's really rather marvellous.

36:40.558 --> 36:42.350
You should call it De Profundis.

36:43.516 --> 36:45.933
Well, it was written from the depths.

36:46.725 --> 36:48.931
Bosie will probably try to kill you
when he reads it.

36:48.933 --> 36:52.808
I wrote some harsh letters to you, Robbie.
I'm sorry.

36:53.141 --> 36:55.641
- You wrote harsh letters to us all.
- I know.

36:59.683 --> 37:01.350
It's hard to explain the feeling...

37:03.308 --> 37:07.266
of utter impotence
and desperation in there.

37:08.641 --> 37:10.058
One becomes a Fury.

37:10.391 --> 37:13.475
One never speaks.
One simply weeps and has diarrhoea.

37:13.766 --> 37:15.266
Result: lunacy.

37:18.975 --> 37:20.058
Do you forgive me?

37:20.766 --> 37:22.931
Who'd have thought that afternoon we met,

37:22.933 --> 37:25.350
fifteen years ago, that here we'd be?

37:26.516 --> 37:29.808
Lepers dining under a full moon
in a foreign hotel.

37:30.641 --> 37:31.975
It's quite romantic, in a way.

37:33.641 --> 37:35.641
Except that you, dear boy,
are not a leper.

37:35.891 --> 37:40.141
Tomorrow morning, you will blow away
on the sea breeze, destination Dover.

37:41.725 --> 37:45.266
As to who would've thought...
We met in a public lavatory, Bobby dear.

37:45.683 --> 37:46.891
And we ended up here.

37:47.766 --> 37:50.558
You wouldn't have to be the Sybil
of Mortimer Street to join the dots.

37:52.308 --> 37:53.600
I was going to a matinee.

37:54.516 --> 37:55.808
And I was going to my club.

37:56.975 --> 37:59.391
A different corner, a minute later...

38:00.100 --> 38:02.723
another play and who knows,

38:02.725 --> 38:05.516
perhaps I should be the poet laureate,
but I doubt it.

38:06.475 --> 38:09.723
Intimacy in the sewers,
followed by fantasy in the Gods.

38:09.725 --> 38:11.558
The rest is silence.

38:44.516 --> 38:47.100
He did not wear his scarlet coat

38:48.016 --> 38:50.308
For blood and wine are red

38:51.725 --> 38:54.266
And blood and wine were on his hands

38:55.058 --> 38:57.183
When they found him with the dead

38:58.141 --> 39:00.808
The poor dead woman whom he loved

39:01.975 --> 39:05.183
And murdered in her bed

39:07.975 --> 39:09.183
Superb.

39:11.725 --> 39:14.806
As the boys' guardian,
I can't impress upon you too strongly

39:14.808 --> 39:18.600
my alarm at your being in contact
with your husband at all.

39:19.183 --> 39:21.058
- Mrs Holland.
- Mrs Wilde.

39:22.391 --> 39:23.558
Constance.

39:25.141 --> 39:26.931
We have been friends for many years.

39:26.933 --> 39:29.850
I am the executor
of your grandfather's estate.

39:30.891 --> 39:34.389
You must trust us. Please sign.

39:35.475 --> 39:37.183
Cyril and Vyvyan, stop fighting!

39:42.933 --> 39:47.516
Be extremely cautious
when you reply to his letter.

39:47.891 --> 39:52.891
I feel sure that if I was to see him once,
I would forgive him everything.

39:53.100 --> 39:56.600
Precisely, my dear, and then you would be
stuck here in Heidelberg forever.

39:57.600 --> 39:59.391
We may go to Genoa in the spring.

40:00.891 --> 40:04.516
A surgeon there thinks he might be able
to do something for my wretched back.

40:04.891 --> 40:06.058
You must wait.

40:06.725 --> 40:08.141
Think of your children.

40:08.433 --> 40:12.308
He must prove to you that he will change,
that he can.

40:28.183 --> 40:30.348
Since you left,
I've been completely alone.

40:30.350 --> 40:32.098
Oscar, that's simply not true.

40:32.100 --> 40:33.764
My wife has written me a revolting letter,

40:33.766 --> 40:36.764
in which she tells me that perhaps
she will see me at some later date,

40:36.766 --> 40:39.683
but not in the foreseeable future,
and the boys probably never.

40:40.141 --> 40:42.723
Quite frankly, Oscar,
I'm amazed you should imagine

40:42.725 --> 40:44.641
that Constance
would want to see you at all.

40:45.350 --> 40:48.848
You wrote her one letter
full of your usual perfumed shit

40:48.850 --> 40:50.806
and you suppose everything
you've put her through

40:50.808 --> 40:53.056
for the past few years
can simply be forgotten.

40:53.058 --> 40:56.473
Robbie, if you've come here to upset me,
I suggest you return to Dieppe

40:56.475 --> 40:59.556
where you'll find a train that leaves at
three minutes past the hour, every hour.

40:59.558 --> 41:02.889
I'm not here to upset you, Oscar.
I just want you to be reasonable.

41:02.891 --> 41:05.598
Bosie, whom you all deplore,
at least offers to help me.

41:05.600 --> 41:09.391
Oh, really? How, Oscar?
How is Bosie gonna help you?

41:10.391 --> 41:11.641
Bosie loves me, Robbie.

41:12.475 --> 41:14.600
In a way that you could never understand.

41:15.308 --> 41:17.933
At any rate, he's coming here next week.

41:22.850 --> 41:24.891
Then you will never see Constance again!

41:25.516 --> 41:26.764
You seem to forget, Oscar,

41:26.766 --> 41:30.808
that despite everything you've put her
through, she still allows you £4 a week.

41:31.308 --> 41:35.933
That £4, Oscar, is dependant
upon Bosie's absence from your life.

41:36.475 --> 41:39.014
But doubtless he'll settle money on you
when he gets here,

41:39.016 --> 41:40.514
if his mother's given him any.

41:40.516 --> 41:43.264
I'm all alone! I have no one!
Why are you being so harsh?

41:43.266 --> 41:45.558
You have me, Oscar! I am here!

41:48.433 --> 41:49.475
But it's not enough, is it?

41:50.975 --> 41:53.391
Why is it not enough, Oscar?

42:00.850 --> 42:02.016
Well, frankly, my dear...

42:02.433 --> 42:05.391
you're not really grand enough
and you're certainly not rough enough.

42:05.600 --> 42:07.225
Let's get a drink, for God's sake.

42:07.475 --> 42:10.141
And don't be cross, Robbie.
You weren't built for rage.

42:10.600 --> 42:15.639
I went on the most marvellous pilgrimage
yesterday to Notre-Dame de Liesse.

42:15.641 --> 42:18.556
Did you know liesse
is the mediaeval word for happiness?

42:18.558 --> 42:20.556
- No, I didn't.
- Well, it is.

42:20.558 --> 42:22.016
I go there every day.

42:22.475 --> 42:25.975
It takes all of ten minutes to get to it
and just as many to get back.

42:26.683 --> 42:29.764
The priest, who is charming
and terribly attractive,

42:29.766 --> 42:31.308
has become a great friend.

42:32.183 --> 42:34.516
Yesterday, he showed me all his vestments.

42:34.975 --> 42:38.891
He looked particularly captivating
in his martyr's garb.

42:39.641 --> 42:42.350
Rose dorée streaked with blood.

43:56.433 --> 43:58.139
You see, Robbie.

43:58.141 --> 44:01.016
Suffering is nothing when there is love.

44:03.016 --> 44:05.308
Love is everything.

44:38.433 --> 44:39.475
Bosie.

44:42.141 --> 44:44.933
♩ The boy I love ♩

44:45.641 --> 44:48.100
♩ Is up in the gallery ♩

44:48.933 --> 44:52.850
♩ The boy I love is looking down at me ♩

44:53.891 --> 44:56.973
♩ There he is, can't you see... ♩

44:56.975 --> 45:00.266
- Oscar.
- ♩ Waving his handkerchief ♩

45:00.975 --> 45:03.433
♩ As merry as a cricket ♩

45:03.850 --> 45:06.181
♩ That lives on the leaf ♩

45:09.058 --> 45:11.766
Oh, come on, Oscar,
it's not like you to have nothing to say.

45:15.933 --> 45:16.933
Oscar.

45:17.891 --> 45:19.058
Oh, Bosie!

45:25.100 --> 45:27.014
Come on.

45:27.016 --> 45:29.056
It's all right.

45:29.058 --> 45:30.350
Come on.

45:32.058 --> 45:33.266
Come on, let's sit down.

45:59.475 --> 46:01.850
- It's all right, shh.
- Oh, thank you.

46:02.933 --> 46:04.141
Oh, how are you?

46:14.808 --> 46:18.306
Oh, Bosie,
it is so lovely to see you!

46:18.308 --> 46:20.683
- Oh, you too.
- Anyway, that night...

46:27.683 --> 46:30.058
Bosie, about that letter
I sent you from prison.

46:31.058 --> 46:32.683
I never got it. What did it say?

46:33.850 --> 46:36.433
Oh. Nothing much. Huh.

46:37.475 --> 46:38.933
It was just my testament.

46:40.350 --> 46:41.850
De Profundis.

46:43.600 --> 46:46.558
Oh, Oscar, you silly old fairy. Come here.

46:52.725 --> 46:54.350
I am my own Judas.

46:55.516 --> 46:56.433
I need a drink.

46:57.516 --> 46:58.850
Come on.

47:02.141 --> 47:05.266
- What are your plans?
- What plans can I have?

47:06.266 --> 47:08.473
The doom of Melmoth
is to wander the earth,

47:08.475 --> 47:10.058
seeking shelter where he can.

47:11.225 --> 47:13.350
- I may go south.
- Naples.

47:14.058 --> 47:16.558
- See it and die.
- If only it were that simple.

47:17.558 --> 47:19.725
- Have you written anything?
- Mm.

47:21.350 --> 47:24.016
A ballad about prison.
It's almost finished.

47:24.475 --> 47:25.683
Rather good, actually.

47:27.558 --> 47:30.558
Oscar, let's run away.
Somewhere no one could find us.

47:31.600 --> 47:33.016
Naples, in fact.

47:36.016 --> 47:39.641
Dear boy,
you don't know what you're saying.

47:43.725 --> 47:46.264
I'm starving. Let's order, for God's sake.

47:50.683 --> 47:54.558
Why do we huddle without the city walls
at a station hotel?

48:02.141 --> 48:04.558
Because I am a ruined man...

48:07.016 --> 48:08.514
if you came with me to Naples,

48:08.516 --> 48:11.475
the world would become a picture
you could look at but never touch.

48:13.183 --> 48:14.600
Do you love me that much, Bosie?

48:16.850 --> 48:19.139
But anyway, we have no money.

48:19.141 --> 48:22.681
Oh, money. Oscar, for Christ's sake,
my mother's got masses.

48:24.433 --> 48:26.516
What are you laughing at?

48:27.016 --> 48:29.433
Nothing. Just something Robbie said.

48:30.058 --> 48:32.641
Robbie's been against me
since the day we met. He's...

48:33.891 --> 48:35.350
riddled with jealousy.

48:35.725 --> 48:37.100
Robbie loves me, Bosie.

48:38.766 --> 48:40.850
In a way that you could never understand.

48:44.891 --> 48:46.016
Shall we take a room?

48:50.391 --> 48:51.225
Hmm?

49:17.683 --> 49:20.808
My going back to Bosie
was psychologically inevitable.

49:21.808 --> 49:24.725
I cannot live
without the atmosphere of love.

49:25.433 --> 49:29.266
"I must love and be loved,
whatever the price I pay for it."

49:41.308 --> 49:43.475
I dare say
what I have done is fatal.

49:44.100 --> 49:48.598
I love him as I always did.
With a sense of tragedy and ruin.

49:51.266 --> 49:53.975
- Oscar!
- Oh, God.

49:58.266 --> 50:00.806
- Oscar!
- Bosie?

50:00.808 --> 50:02.808
Listen to me, you little...

50:03.016 --> 50:05.181
It's under my chair, it's under my chair!

50:05.183 --> 50:07.598
There it is! Get it!

50:07.600 --> 50:11.473
It's behind the cupboard! Get it!
Oscar, there are fucking rats everywhere!

50:11.475 --> 50:14.516
- For God's sake, Bosie, calm down.
- It was in the fucking bed, Oscar!

50:15.016 --> 50:16.266
Kill it! Kill it!

50:16.766 --> 50:18.641
It's only a rat,
don't worry about it.

50:20.016 --> 50:21.639
Bosie, you're completely hysterical.

50:21.641 --> 50:25.350
Get that fucking thing away from me.
You keep that fucking away from me!

50:29.225 --> 50:32.391
This place is
fucking ridiculous! Fucking ridiculous!

50:36.308 --> 50:39.973
I forbid it. I forbid him
to live with that infernal man.

50:39.975 --> 50:43.098
- There was nothing anyone could do.
- Well, I shall not pay his allowance.

50:43.100 --> 50:45.475
- You can tell him when you see him.
- That's unlikely, madam.

50:45.975 --> 50:48.058
I've resigned as his literary executor.

50:49.600 --> 50:51.016
He doesn't know you're here, I presume.

50:52.475 --> 50:53.308
He does not.

50:55.266 --> 50:56.725
Why do you mind so much?

51:06.016 --> 51:09.100
They told me to be wary of you, Mr Ross.
They say you can't be trusted.

51:11.433 --> 51:13.350
But we're the same, you and I.

51:15.683 --> 51:17.433
He's hurt you too, hasn't he?

51:23.641 --> 51:27.350
Oscar destroyed himself
and everyone around him.

51:30.016 --> 51:32.683
Look at me, Mr Ross. Just look at me.

51:35.975 --> 51:36.850
He's killed me.

51:45.016 --> 51:46.641
Someone walking over my grave.

51:50.016 --> 51:51.431
Our dear friend, the witch,

51:51.433 --> 51:54.014
is coming back on Friday
to finish things off.

51:54.016 --> 51:54.931
Oh, God.

51:54.933 --> 51:57.473
But her spells and smells
appear to have worked.

51:57.475 --> 52:00.725
- About time.
- The good news is there are no more rats.

52:01.391 --> 52:03.556
The bad news is
my allowance is being cut off.

52:04.808 --> 52:07.181
Do you always have
to talk about money during lunch?

52:07.183 --> 52:10.600
Obviously, I should prefer to discuss
serving techniques with our waiter.

52:12.600 --> 52:14.473
We must make some sort of plan, Bosie.

52:14.475 --> 52:17.806
I came here at your invitation.
You said you had funds, you do not.

52:17.808 --> 52:19.306
I accept that.

52:19.308 --> 52:21.933
Why should a perfectly divine leopard
change its spots?

52:22.266 --> 52:24.639
But the fact remains we have, what, £6?

52:24.641 --> 52:25.683
Five.

52:26.641 --> 52:28.100
I had to pay last week's rent up.

52:29.683 --> 52:31.516
Careful, his mother is watching.

52:33.141 --> 52:34.850
Yes, and she's thrilled.

52:36.808 --> 52:40.391
Don't be such a bore.
Oscar, what's happened to you?

52:42.058 --> 52:44.933
We have £6 a week from my mother.

52:45.308 --> 52:48.308
We have £100
for the libretto you will never write.

52:48.933 --> 52:51.889
We have studs and cuff-links,
friends and relations,

52:51.891 --> 52:53.431
and, above all, we still have each other.

52:55.308 --> 52:57.641
One of us could eat the other
and make a tent of the hide.

52:57.891 --> 52:59.058
For God's sake, stop worrying.

53:16.016 --> 53:18.308
You always talk to boys
as though they were blood stock.

53:18.766 --> 53:21.891
You should tell them to lift their hoofs
and open their mouths.

53:26.558 --> 53:27.891
And then thrash 'em.

53:30.058 --> 53:32.514
I need to make sure
they don't fall at the first fence.

54:10.516 --> 54:11.558
Go on, dear, fuck him.

54:51.558 --> 54:52.600
Oh.

54:53.350 --> 54:54.683
Isn't it beautiful?

54:56.391 --> 54:59.350
You see? I can make you happy.

55:01.308 --> 55:02.308
Yes.

55:03.350 --> 55:04.350
You can.

55:06.725 --> 55:08.016
No more anxiety.

55:09.975 --> 55:12.308
No more ambition. No time.

55:13.558 --> 55:15.350
Just now.

55:16.933 --> 55:18.933
Fisherman diving for pearls.

55:19.891 --> 55:21.933
An old sheep with his butcher.

55:22.808 --> 55:24.891
A bobbing boat on a silver sea.

55:26.225 --> 55:27.433
And scandal...

55:30.933 --> 55:32.808
just a small black dot...

55:34.600 --> 55:36.516
against the edge of dawn.

56:06.058 --> 56:08.975
Yet each man kills the thing
he loves

56:09.933 --> 56:11.808
By each, let this be heard

56:12.766 --> 56:14.558
Some do it with a bitter look

56:15.933 --> 56:17.725
Some with a flattering word

56:18.766 --> 56:20.683
The coward does it with a kiss

56:22.100 --> 56:24.183
The brave man with a sword

56:25.850 --> 56:26.808
It's finished

56:38.933 --> 56:41.516
Some kill their love when they are young

56:42.266 --> 56:43.766
And some when they are old

56:44.683 --> 56:47.641
Some strangle with the hands of Lust

56:48.266 --> 56:49.933
Some with the hands of Gold

56:51.225 --> 56:53.808
The kindest use a knife, because

56:54.350 --> 56:56.558
The dead so soon grow cold

56:58.183 --> 57:00.683
Some love too little, some too long

57:01.141 --> 57:03.308
Some sell and others buy

57:04.100 --> 57:06.556
Some do the deed with many tears

57:06.558 --> 57:08.641
And some without a sigh

57:09.600 --> 57:12.433
For each man kills the thing he loves

57:13.225 --> 57:15.725
Yet each man does not die

57:18.683 --> 57:20.431
Oh, look, here we go. Bosie.

57:32.016 --> 57:33.933
Is Father all alone in the hospital?

57:34.183 --> 57:35.725
No, of course not, darling.

57:36.808 --> 57:38.806
At Christmas,
all the patients have a party.

58:07.141 --> 58:10.764
♩ Good King Wenceslas last looked out ♩

58:10.766 --> 58:13.891
♩ On the Feast of Stephen ♩

58:14.391 --> 58:17.598
♩ When the snow lay round about ♩

58:17.600 --> 58:21.100
♩ Deep and crisp and even ♩

58:21.475 --> 58:24.016
♩ Brightly shone the moon that night... ♩

58:26.100 --> 58:26.933
Felice!

58:49.100 --> 58:49.933
Huh?

59:50.891 --> 59:52.433
This one's from Papa.

59:54.100 --> 59:55.889
Vyvyan doesn't know who Papa is.

59:55.891 --> 59:57.348
Yes, I do!

01:00:06.766 --> 01:00:08.308
What an earth is going on?

01:00:08.808 --> 01:00:12.598
One can run up a bill for everything
in this swamp except sex, it seems.

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:15.558
There's never credit where love is
concerned, Bosie. You should know that.

01:00:29.391 --> 01:00:32.308
No, no! Right, stop it!

01:00:33.183 --> 01:00:34.641
Be silent! Stop!

01:00:39.641 --> 01:00:41.141
- Oh, what bollocks.
- I said be quiet!

01:01:20.141 --> 01:01:22.141
What the hell did you give him that for?

01:01:24.141 --> 01:01:25.641
A foolish question, I know.

01:01:26.891 --> 01:01:29.725
- Why didn't you just pay him?
- With what?

01:01:30.183 --> 01:01:31.766
Money.

01:01:33.058 --> 01:01:34.308
I haven't got any.

01:01:35.808 --> 01:01:37.683
What do you mean, you haven't got any?

01:01:43.933 --> 01:01:44.766
Well?

01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:51.058
- My mother has stopped my allowance.
- What? When did this happen?

01:01:52.225 --> 01:01:53.308
Oh, Christ!

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:55.808
I was waiting
for the right moment to tell you.

01:01:56.808 --> 01:01:59.433
In the meantime, you imagined
that wretched boy would fuck you for fun.

01:01:59.641 --> 01:02:03.308
- And why not?
- Oh, your vanity is extraordinary.

01:02:04.225 --> 01:02:06.598
The only person who ever fucked you
for fun was me,

01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:08.641
and look where it got me, the dock.

01:02:08.891 --> 01:02:11.141
- What?
- Nothing.

01:02:12.350 --> 01:02:14.183
So, that's it, then!

01:02:14.516 --> 01:02:16.600
We appear to have come
to the end of the road.

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:20.475
- We're penniless.
- Well, not exactly.

01:02:22.225 --> 01:02:23.225
Oh?

01:02:25.641 --> 01:02:28.433
You could have £200
and I could keep my allowance.

01:02:29.266 --> 01:02:30.141
If?

01:02:39.641 --> 01:02:40.766
Well...

01:02:45.308 --> 01:02:47.848
You see, what mama and the family
really can't stomach

01:02:47.850 --> 01:02:49.558
is the fact that we live together.

01:02:51.641 --> 01:02:57.473
She says that if we agree to separate,
then she will reinstate my allowance

01:02:57.475 --> 01:03:00.931
and very generously, I think,
give you a substantial...

01:03:00.933 --> 01:03:02.016
Tip!

01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:09.600
For services rendered...

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:11.766
to the family.

01:03:12.725 --> 01:03:15.975
Will I get a good reference?
Can I keep my cottage?

01:03:16.725 --> 01:03:19.558
God, you all make me sick!

01:03:19.975 --> 01:03:25.100
And your sanctimonious mother
thinks I can be bought off for £200.

01:03:25.808 --> 01:03:28.766
Your family has destroyed me,
stripped me of everything!

01:03:29.808 --> 01:03:31.225
Not least my genius.

01:03:31.558 --> 01:03:33.850
And all for £200!

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:36.558
Genius?

01:03:37.391 --> 01:03:39.889
- You destroyed yourself, Oscar!
- Oh, fuck off!

01:03:39.891 --> 01:03:42.808
Because underneath the pose,
there was no substance!

01:03:43.266 --> 01:03:47.056
One good comedy,
three pot-boiling melodramas

01:03:47.058 --> 01:03:49.850
and those ridiculous
fucking fairy storeys.

01:03:50.433 --> 01:03:54.266
That's all you find when you scrape away
the powder and the pancake.

01:03:54.516 --> 01:03:58.556
Your success was interesting,
your hunger for it perversely fascinating,

01:03:58.558 --> 01:04:02.308
but you, my dear... never were.

01:04:02.558 --> 01:04:04.931
You found me interesting
when you were faced with blackmail!

01:04:04.933 --> 01:04:06.598
Oh, you were in your element.

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:10.308
You saw the green baize door swing open
and you scuttled through it.

01:04:10.891 --> 01:04:13.264
You are talking drivel. My father...

01:04:13.266 --> 01:04:16.808
Was a drunken groper
with dirty fingernails, just like his son.

01:04:17.183 --> 01:04:20.556
Whereas your father
is an assassin at large!

01:04:20.558 --> 01:04:22.308
Oh, come on, Oscar, you're still alive.

01:04:25.766 --> 01:04:26.641
Barely.

01:04:27.641 --> 01:04:29.433
For God's sake, stop acting.

01:04:31.641 --> 01:04:32.891
It's strange.

01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:36.100
I've never really looked at you before.

01:04:37.558 --> 01:04:39.641
I gave you my whole life.

01:04:40.558 --> 01:04:44.975
And now I see it before me,
daubed in shit.

01:04:48.183 --> 01:04:51.058
I'll write to you when I get to Rome.
Where will you be?

01:04:52.433 --> 01:04:53.641
I've really no idea.

01:04:54.516 --> 01:04:56.891
I suppose I may as well stay here
till the lease runs out.

01:04:57.683 --> 01:04:59.600
Then I shall probably go to Paris.

01:05:00.141 --> 01:05:01.141
Who knows?

01:05:01.725 --> 01:05:03.391
At any rate, we'll be in touch.

01:05:04.266 --> 01:05:06.100
Dear boy, do you mind awfully
if I don't wait?

01:05:06.641 --> 01:05:10.058
I'm not really built for waving
pocket handkerchiefs at parting trains.

01:05:14.475 --> 01:05:15.850
I'm too big!

01:05:57.808 --> 01:05:58.766
Hello, Oscar.

01:05:59.433 --> 01:06:00.475
Constance.

01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:03.308
Is that you?

01:06:05.058 --> 01:06:06.266
Where's Lord Alfred?

01:06:07.766 --> 01:06:08.808
Has he left?

01:06:10.391 --> 01:06:13.389
Are you quite alone now?

01:06:13.391 --> 01:06:14.641
Where are the boys?

01:06:17.433 --> 01:06:18.558
Must get on.

01:06:20.683 --> 01:06:22.183
Such a long way to go.

01:06:23.350 --> 01:06:24.266
Constance...

01:06:25.558 --> 01:06:27.808
- We never meant...
- I loved you so much.

01:06:29.475 --> 01:06:30.475
Always.

01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:33.558
It's odd, isn't it?

01:06:39.725 --> 01:06:44.098
♩ The boy I love is up in the gallery ♩

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:48.266
♩ The boy I love is looking down at me ♩

01:06:48.808 --> 01:06:51.766
♩ There he is, can't you see ♩

01:08:21.350 --> 01:08:22.808
Hmm?

01:08:42.558 --> 01:08:43.558
Hmm.

01:09:21.183 --> 01:09:22.808
My pleasure, Mr Melmoth.

01:09:32.265 --> 01:09:33.100
Mmm.

01:10:48.641 --> 01:10:49.808
Hmm...

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:07.725
Ah!

01:13:13.975 --> 01:13:15.016
Robbie!

01:13:16.058 --> 01:13:17.225
Stop a minute, please!

01:13:18.266 --> 01:13:19.183
Oscar.

01:13:19.683 --> 01:13:24.639
"Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania."
Yes, dear boy, it is I.

01:13:24.641 --> 01:13:25.808
Why are you sitting in the rain?

01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:30.933
I've spent all my ready cash on youth
and beauty and I cannot pay.

01:13:31.141 --> 01:13:33.683
- Please help me.
- Let's go inside.

01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:42.598
Like dear St Francis,
I am wedded to poverty.

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:45.350
Only in my case,
the marriage is not a success.

01:13:45.725 --> 01:13:48.225
Robbie, you are naughty.
How long have you been here?

01:13:51.808 --> 01:13:53.933
Twelve francs!

01:13:54.225 --> 01:13:56.223
- God, Oscar.
- It's been a long day.

01:13:56.225 --> 01:13:59.266
- Do you have 12 francs for me or not?
- Yes, of course.

01:14:02.016 --> 01:14:04.389
Once again, I am in your debt.

01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:10.225
Dear Robbie, I've missed you so much.

01:14:10.725 --> 01:14:13.181
Almost a year of punitive silence.

01:14:13.183 --> 01:14:17.516
Naples was, as you so accurately
predicted, a disaster.

01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:19.641
I know I'm always asking for it...

01:14:21.266 --> 01:14:23.264
but do I have your forgiveness?

01:14:23.266 --> 01:14:27.056
Forgiveness is for amateurs and you,
dear Oscar, are a professional masochist.

01:14:27.058 --> 01:14:29.348
Ooh!

01:14:29.350 --> 01:14:30.433
It's stopped raining.

01:14:31.016 --> 01:14:33.558
- I'll take you home.
- Oh, dear boy, so cruel. What?

01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:37.183
Let us not squabble
like two disgruntled housemaids.

01:14:37.391 --> 01:14:41.058
Let us rather black our grace with
a light-hearted chatter about our betters.

01:14:41.433 --> 01:14:45.931
Bosie, we hear, has come into £20,000.

01:14:45.933 --> 01:14:47.389
He arrives next week.

01:14:47.391 --> 01:14:50.016
I thought I might touch him
for a tiny pourboire.

01:14:50.266 --> 01:14:51.558
How long are you here, Robbie?

01:14:51.850 --> 01:14:53.806
I'm joining my mother in Menton
on Tuesday.

01:14:53.808 --> 01:14:55.600
More paraffin injections.

01:14:56.058 --> 01:14:57.058
How lovely.

01:14:57.683 --> 01:15:00.933
You should take Oscar.
He looks like a rotten egg in aspic.

01:15:01.975 --> 01:15:02.850
What happened?

01:15:03.308 --> 01:15:05.766
I was poisoned by a moule last week
when Robbie arrived.

01:15:06.183 --> 01:15:09.433
- I've had mysterious skin ever since.
- Leprosy, I expect.

01:15:09.766 --> 01:15:12.889
Oh, thank you, my dear. But let us talk
about more cheerful things.

01:15:12.891 --> 01:15:15.889
Your father's death, for example.
How did it go?

01:15:15.891 --> 01:15:19.223
Without a hitch, for the most part.
In and out of consciousness.

01:15:19.225 --> 01:15:20.348
As in life.

01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:22.683
My brother, Percy, went to see him
just before the end.

01:15:23.183 --> 01:15:26.475
- Father opened his eyes and spat at him.
- Queensbury rules.

01:15:26.850 --> 01:15:28.850
Well, I, at least,
have outlived my nemesis.

01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:32.141
Although I'm more or less
starving at the moment.

01:15:32.475 --> 01:15:34.266
Shovelling down lobster Newberg.

01:15:34.516 --> 01:15:38.181
A magnificent treat,
and, at the moment, sadly all too rare.

01:15:38.183 --> 01:15:41.056
Bosie dear, this brings me rather neatly
to an awkward point.

01:15:41.058 --> 01:15:45.139
Oscar, do not ask me for money.
I have absolutely none spare.

01:15:45.141 --> 01:15:48.556
Dear boy, you've just inherited £20,000.

01:15:48.558 --> 01:15:50.431
Surely, you don't wish
to see me on the street.

01:15:50.433 --> 01:15:53.098
As you're behaving like an old prostitute,
Oscar, perhaps that's where you belong.

01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:55.639
- For God's sake, Bosie.
- Keep out of this, Robbie.

01:15:55.641 --> 01:15:57.808
- This has nothing to do with you.
- Unfortunately, it has.

01:15:58.475 --> 01:16:02.431
Since Oscar threw in his lot with you in
Naples, he's been cut adrift by everyone.

01:16:02.433 --> 01:16:04.806
Constance has died, his sons
have been taken away from him,

01:16:04.808 --> 01:16:06.473
his so-called friends have deserted him

01:16:06.475 --> 01:16:08.806
and now you, who owe him everything,
turn your back.

01:16:08.808 --> 01:16:10.973
I am sick and tired of being blamed

01:16:10.975 --> 01:16:13.348
for the self-inflicted wounds
of a gluttonous snob!

01:16:13.350 --> 01:16:16.181
I'm not my lover's keeper!
If he wants to eat, he should work!

01:16:16.183 --> 01:16:19.389
- Oscar, what have you written recently?
- Ah, the pudding trolley.

01:16:19.391 --> 01:16:21.891
I see your little eyes light up.
What shall we have?

01:16:22.183 --> 01:16:24.848
Robbie, you'll burst a haemorrhoid.
It was only a passing thought.

01:16:24.850 --> 01:16:27.014
- Like all your work.
- You disgust me, Bosie!

01:16:27.016 --> 01:16:28.100
Do you suppose I care?

01:16:30.266 --> 01:16:32.975
I asked you a question, Oscar.
Does the flame still burn?

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:35.391
No, it doesn't, does it?

01:16:35.725 --> 01:16:37.264
So I'm supposed to keep you in luxury

01:16:37.266 --> 01:16:39.681
while you stumble about
the boulevard begging for drinks.

01:16:39.683 --> 01:16:40.766
Christ!

01:16:41.308 --> 01:16:42.725
Some of us have to work!

01:16:43.433 --> 01:16:44.391
Come along.

01:16:48.558 --> 01:16:52.225
Reggie will be here when you wake up,
and I'll be back in no time.

01:16:53.850 --> 01:16:56.725
- Have you told Bosie?
- I haven't seen him since that lunch.

01:16:57.016 --> 01:16:59.014
But you must. If something happens.

01:16:59.016 --> 01:16:59.850
It won't.

01:17:04.350 --> 01:17:07.766
Is it really necessary, Doctor Tucker?
I feel perfectly well, you know.

01:17:08.141 --> 01:17:09.683
We shall be as quick as we can.

01:17:48.558 --> 01:17:50.348
Oscar, you old fraud.

01:17:50.350 --> 01:17:51.641
You look perfectly well.

01:17:52.433 --> 01:17:54.891
I know. Can you believe it?

01:17:55.516 --> 01:18:00.056
Once poisonous moule four months ago and
I've been in and out of bed ever since.

01:18:03.141 --> 01:18:07.306
Dear boy, behind the commode,
you will find a bottle of Champagne.

01:18:07.308 --> 01:18:10.308
Open it.
Let us drink to your arrival. Hmm?

01:18:13.266 --> 01:18:14.391
Shouldn't really.

01:18:15.058 --> 01:18:16.475
Of course we shouldn't.

01:18:17.683 --> 01:18:20.183
You've crossed the water
for a treasured friend.

01:18:20.725 --> 01:18:22.433
There are glasses under the bed.

01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:29.058
You poor darling.

01:18:30.558 --> 01:18:32.516
But I hear you're writing a new play.

01:18:33.183 --> 01:18:34.806
Yes, in a way.

01:18:34.808 --> 01:18:40.141
Robbie has left me some divine notebooks
in which to scribble beautiful thoughts.

01:18:41.475 --> 01:18:42.641
But unfortunately...

01:18:43.975 --> 01:18:45.433
I haven't had any this year.

01:18:48.891 --> 01:18:50.016
Mmm.

01:18:53.516 --> 01:18:55.473
I will tell you a terrible secret.

01:18:55.475 --> 01:18:58.058
And don't tell Robbie,
please, Reggie, there's a dear.

01:18:59.850 --> 01:19:03.308
I have sold the play
to three different individuals.

01:19:03.683 --> 01:19:05.308
And I haven't written a single word.

01:19:06.933 --> 01:19:08.266
Rather clever, don't you think?

01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:12.348
There's nothing like an Irish beggar
when he gets into his stride.

01:19:12.350 --> 01:19:14.598
What will you do
when the times comes to deliver it?

01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:15.850
Oh.

01:19:16.475 --> 01:19:17.350
Die.

01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:19.933
I am...

01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:23.391
paralysed by dark thoughts.

01:19:25.058 --> 01:19:26.308
Sometimes I wonder.

01:19:27.975 --> 01:19:29.100
Is it a moule?

01:19:30.558 --> 01:19:31.850
It could be something else.

01:19:32.683 --> 01:19:33.808
Oh, God.

01:19:34.308 --> 01:19:37.058
Reggie, why did Constance die?

01:19:37.808 --> 01:19:39.391
Why have I become so mad?

01:19:39.808 --> 01:19:43.391
My brain is crashed and shattered.
Is this...?

01:19:43.891 --> 01:19:44.725
Syphilis.

01:19:47.766 --> 01:19:48.600
What?

01:19:51.141 --> 01:19:53.225
Do you see the hell in which I live?

01:19:54.391 --> 01:19:58.056
Robbie wants me to write a play,
but I am wrestling with my soul.

01:19:58.058 --> 01:20:00.973
- Reggie, I cannot write a play!
- Of course you can.

01:20:00.975 --> 01:20:03.056
Now come on, Oscar,
pull yourself together!

01:20:03.058 --> 01:20:05.973
The doctor says, within a few days,
we'll be able to take you out for a drive.

01:20:05.975 --> 01:20:07.308
We're going to have a lovely time.

01:20:10.725 --> 01:20:14.433
I can't think what happened last week.
My whole life was a blur.

01:20:22.683 --> 01:20:24.350
Very well.

01:20:28.266 --> 01:20:30.223
Oscar!

01:20:30.225 --> 01:20:33.308
Oh, Reggie, fuck off!
One last drink before I die.

01:20:38.975 --> 01:20:41.556
I've been teaching Maurice English,

01:20:41.558 --> 01:20:43.598
but he is much more fluent
in the language of love.

01:20:53.308 --> 01:20:55.100
- Oscar!
- Can I have a scarf, please?

01:20:58.600 --> 01:20:59.931
Thank you very much.

01:20:59.933 --> 01:21:01.141
Oh, it's freezing!

01:21:05.058 --> 01:21:06.014
Get off!

01:21:06.016 --> 01:21:08.431
- Reggie, I didn't know you cared.
- Off they come.

01:21:08.433 --> 01:21:10.808
Oh, God, Reggie!

01:21:12.558 --> 01:21:15.600
Careful of my ear.

01:21:16.766 --> 01:21:18.808
Can you pull me up a bit more, dear boy?

01:21:26.225 --> 01:21:28.933
Who can that be at this hour?

01:21:39.808 --> 01:21:41.308
Christ, are we to be spared nothing?

01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:57.516
You see, Reggie,
more creditors to add to our list.

01:21:57.766 --> 01:21:59.975
I am dying beyond my means.

01:22:37.308 --> 01:22:39.266
Hmm?

01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:18.766
Reggie, turn down the gaslight, would you?

01:24:43.641 --> 01:24:45.181
He had just enough strength

01:24:45.183 --> 01:24:47.933
to fly up to
the Prince's shoulder once more.

01:24:48.725 --> 01:24:52.100
"Goodbye, dear Prince", he murmured.

01:24:54.058 --> 01:24:57.391
"I'm glad you're going to Egypt,"
said the Happy Prince.

01:25:38.808 --> 01:25:40.516
The disciples sleep.

01:25:42.725 --> 01:25:44.225
The end is nigh.

01:25:51.433 --> 01:25:53.850
Was the cause of death mentioned?

01:25:54.183 --> 01:25:56.014
A severe chill, it seems!

01:25:58.850 --> 01:26:02.141
As a man sows, so shall he reap.

01:26:04.475 --> 01:26:08.431
Will the... internment take place here?

01:26:08.433 --> 01:26:12.100
No! He seems to have expressed
the desire to be buried in Paris.

01:26:12.975 --> 01:26:15.725
- Come home soon, Father.
- Tomorrow.

01:26:16.433 --> 01:26:18.766
And tomorrow and tomorrow.

01:26:25.641 --> 01:26:27.766
- Oscar.
- Oh, Reggie.

01:26:28.683 --> 01:26:30.975
Look. The boys.

01:26:32.308 --> 01:26:35.139
Which boys? Maurice? Bosie?

01:26:35.141 --> 01:26:36.183
I'm sorry.

01:26:37.683 --> 01:26:39.058
I'm awfully sorry.

01:26:40.183 --> 01:26:41.725
So many broken hearts.

01:26:42.225 --> 01:26:45.891
And they will have to live with it
forever and ever and ever and ever.

01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:49.100
World without end.

01:27:01.475 --> 01:27:03.683
Yesterday, she decided I was a waiter.

01:27:04.016 --> 01:27:06.225
- And today?
- I don't know.

01:27:06.975 --> 01:27:08.600
Hasn't spoken. Listen.

01:27:10.058 --> 01:27:12.516
The doctor said
he can't last more than 48 hours.

01:27:14.475 --> 01:27:17.016
- Have you called a priest?
- No, should I?

01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:18.891
Well, I will, then.

01:27:19.850 --> 01:27:24.350
I must tell you, Father, the dying man has
been quite a well-known literary figure.

01:27:25.141 --> 01:27:28.225
Oh, well, that's all one and the same
to God, Mr Ross.

01:27:29.391 --> 01:27:30.848
He has very little time to read,

01:27:30.850 --> 01:27:33.766
what with all us sinners clogging up
the road to hell.

01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:39.473
Well, what is the name of this friend
of yours who comes home so late,

01:27:39.475 --> 01:27:43.266
and yet is so thirsty
for the sacred blood of our Lord?

01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:48.016
- Oscar Wilde.
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

01:27:49.725 --> 01:27:50.973
Well, I...

01:27:50.975 --> 01:27:54.681
Has Mr Wilde expressed
a desire for extreme unction?

01:27:54.683 --> 01:27:57.433
Most certainly.
While he could still speak.

01:27:57.683 --> 01:28:00.350
Has been received? Is he not a Protestant?

01:28:02.391 --> 01:28:04.016
He was meant to be a Catholic.

01:28:06.058 --> 01:28:07.766
Oh! No...

01:28:09.641 --> 01:28:10.683
Don't...

01:28:11.225 --> 01:28:14.683
Don't worry, my son.
Don't worry, don't worry, Mr Ross.

01:28:15.058 --> 01:28:16.931
Don't... We'll sort something out.

01:28:16.933 --> 01:28:19.308
I've got everything here we'll need.

01:28:20.016 --> 01:28:24.183
Unless, of course,
um... exorcism is required.

01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:29.850
That's, that's my little joke.

01:28:35.725 --> 01:28:38.514
Ah, well, we're in time.

01:28:38.516 --> 01:28:42.058
Good evening,
Mr Dupoirier. We missed you on Sunday.

01:28:42.558 --> 01:28:43.683
Oscar, can you hear me?

01:28:44.266 --> 01:28:46.891
This is Father Dunn.
Reggie, move!

01:28:48.516 --> 01:28:53.475
Father Dunn is willing to receive you
into the church and give you absolution.

01:28:53.975 --> 01:28:56.558
But you need to sit up and pay attention.

01:28:56.766 --> 01:28:58.058
Now, now, Mr Ross.

01:28:58.558 --> 01:28:59.889
Between the stirrup and the ground,

01:28:59.891 --> 01:29:02.808
there's always time
for an act of contrition.

01:29:04.641 --> 01:29:05.891
There's no need to hurry.

01:29:14.975 --> 01:29:15.933
Thank you.

01:29:16.183 --> 01:29:20.183
Good evening, Mr Wilde.
My name is Father Cuthbert Dunn.

01:29:21.016 --> 01:29:24.181
Now, I'm going to say
a few simple things to you, but I need...

01:29:24.183 --> 01:29:27.891
I need to know that you understand them.
A little sign will do.

01:29:31.891 --> 01:29:35.100
That's very good. Let us kneel and pray.

01:29:38.141 --> 01:29:41.433
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen.

01:29:42.683 --> 01:29:43.683
Father...

01:29:44.683 --> 01:29:47.183
look with pity on your servant, Oscar.

01:29:48.391 --> 01:29:50.266
Absolve him of his sins.

01:29:51.391 --> 01:29:53.516
And Mr Wilde, examine your conscience.

01:29:54.391 --> 01:29:56.933
There are no secrets between God and man.

01:29:58.183 --> 01:29:59.391
Talk to him.

01:30:02.808 --> 01:30:06.183
Where did you lose sight
of our blessed Lord?

01:30:09.975 --> 01:30:11.641
Clapham Junction.

01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:20.266
Jesus Christ was nailed
to the cross in Golgotha

01:30:20.516 --> 01:30:22.681
so that our sins might be forgiven.

01:30:26.891 --> 01:30:29.848
I baptise you in the name of the Father...

01:30:29.850 --> 01:30:32.766
and of the son and of the Holy Ghost.

01:30:33.266 --> 01:30:36.266
Though I walk
through the valley of death...

01:30:36.891 --> 01:30:39.475
and raise my eyes to the hills...

01:30:40.516 --> 01:30:42.350
whence cometh my delight.

01:30:44.933 --> 01:30:46.889
That was beautiful, wasn't it?

01:30:46.891 --> 01:30:49.181
- We're so grateful.
- Ah, no, not at all.

01:30:49.183 --> 01:30:54.183
But it is a great privilege
to meet such a distinguished author.

01:30:54.516 --> 01:30:58.100
If you need me, our friend, Mr Dupoirier,
knows where to find me.

01:31:07.266 --> 01:31:08.891
It's going to be a beautiful day.

01:31:54.558 --> 01:31:56.308
Do go on, Mr Wilde.

01:31:58.683 --> 01:32:01.891
So they pulled down
the statue of the Happy Prince.

01:32:02.433 --> 01:32:05.850
"As he is no longer beautiful,
he is no longer useful,"

01:32:06.350 --> 01:32:09.766
said the Art professor at the University.

01:32:10.933 --> 01:32:13.475
And they melted the statue in a furnace.

01:32:15.183 --> 01:32:20.058
"What a strange thing," said the overseer
of the workmen at the foundry.

01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:23.850
"This broken lead heart will not melt.

01:32:25.058 --> 01:32:26.641
They must throw it away."

01:32:29.016 --> 01:32:34.600
So they threw it on a dust heap,
where the dead Swallow was also lying.

01:33:32.725 --> 01:33:34.808
For Christ's sake, Bosie, shut up!

01:33:38.475 --> 01:33:40.641
You can't understand, Robbie,
but how could you?

01:33:41.433 --> 01:33:44.975
- Understand what?
- The sort of love that Oscar and I shared.

01:33:45.558 --> 01:33:49.850
You've never shared anything with anybody.
You're too fucking selfish.

01:33:50.058 --> 01:33:51.014
Robbie.

01:33:51.016 --> 01:33:53.225
- Where were you when he was dying?
- Here we go.

01:33:53.516 --> 01:33:56.516
You could never accept the fact
that Oscar loved me and not you.

01:33:57.350 --> 01:33:58.806
Because he didn't, did he?

01:33:58.808 --> 01:34:00.516
However hard you tried.

01:34:01.850 --> 01:34:03.391
And how you tried.

01:34:09.100 --> 01:34:10.308
Bosie!

01:34:11.975 --> 01:34:14.098
- Fuck!
- For Christ's sake, Bosie!

01:34:14.100 --> 01:34:18.308
You're a second-rate prole!
You know what Oscar thought about you?

01:34:19.016 --> 01:34:21.475
He thought you were a useful bore!

01:34:21.933 --> 01:34:24.600
When history looks back,
it won't be at you!

01:34:24.891 --> 01:34:27.016
It will be at him and me!

01:34:27.433 --> 01:34:30.516
You'll just be a footnote,
you dreary little cunt!

01:34:33.933 --> 01:34:37.056
"Bring me
the two most precious things in the city",

01:34:37.058 --> 01:34:38.891
said God to one of his angels.

01:34:40.183 --> 01:34:43.516
And the angel brought him
the leaden heart and the dead bird.

01:34:45.183 --> 01:34:47.683
"You have rightly chosen", said God.

01:34:48.516 --> 01:34:52.808
"For in my garden of paradise,
this little bird shall sing forever.

01:34:53.558 --> 01:34:57.766
And in my city of gold,
the Happy Prince shall praise me."

01:35:20.433 --> 01:35:24.308
Author! Author! Author! Author!

01:35:26.725 --> 01:35:28.100
It's a dream.

01:36:28.602 --> 01:36:33.602
