00:01.870 --> 00:03.735
POTE: Previously, on "Queen of the South"...

00:03.780 --> 00:05.862
JAMES: Arizona's carved up
by five narcos.

00:05.910 --> 00:08.083
They're called La Comisin. They meet on Taza's territory,

00:08.130 --> 00:09.688
but it's Pecas who calls the shots.

00:09.740 --> 00:12.083
Perhaps you'd be better off

00:12.140 --> 00:15.177
taking your business out of
Arizona while you still can.

00:15.230 --> 00:17.312
What if I brought
something else to the table?

00:17.360 --> 00:19.533
Well, I'm sure we could
think of something.

00:19.580 --> 00:21.229
We could have allies
against Pecas.

00:21.280 --> 00:23.145
Give me one good reason
I shouldn't deliver you

00:23.190 --> 00:24.623
to Pecas right now.

00:24.670 --> 00:26.843
Because you need me
more than you need him.

00:26.890 --> 00:28.198
[speaking Spanish]

00:28.240 --> 00:31.767
[speaking Spanish]

00:31.810 --> 00:34.324
[speaking Spanish]

00:34.380 --> 00:37.201
Cochi's got some great skills
with the knife, no?

00:37.250 --> 00:39.115
CORTEZ: Isabela is still sneaking out

00:39.160 --> 00:40.468
to meet with Kique Jimenez.

00:40.510 --> 00:44.207
-If we were to kidnap the boy--
-Do it.

00:44.260 --> 00:46.125
But no one _can harm him
under any Circumstances.

00:46.170 --> 00:47.774
[grunts]

00:47.830 --> 00:50.082
Isabela cannot know that
it's me that gave the order.

00:50.130 --> 00:51.472
[yelling]

00:51.520 --> 00:53.693
CAMILA:
I would lose her forever.

00:53.740 --> 00:56.356
CORTEZ: Are you sure
you want to know?

00:56.400 --> 00:58.265
I'm going to
make my mother pay.

00:58.310 --> 01:00.358
[dramatic music]

01:00.400 --> 01:01.742
[speaking Spanish]

01:01.800 --> 01:04.314
Now, how much dinero
is it going to cost me--

01:04.360 --> 01:07.921
[grunting]

01:07.980 --> 01:10.881
We've got Pecas in the north,
Camila to the south.

01:10.940 --> 01:12.931
-We can't win.
-There IS a way.

01:12.980 --> 01:14.584
We have to make a deal
with Mayo.

01:14.630 --> 01:16.325
You're going after Pecas.

01:16.380 --> 01:17.938
Don't even think
of betraying me.

01:17.990 --> 01:20.891
The video of you beating
that inmate will go viral.

01:20.950 --> 01:22.247
JAMES: Am I going to
take the shot, or not?

01:22.290 --> 01:23.723
TERESA: No, we wait.

01:23.770 --> 01:27.126
When the time is right,
we'll kill them all.

01:27.170 --> 01:30.162
[upbeat music]

01:32.170 --> 01:35.344
JAMES: Wipe out the Comisin? Are you sure about this?

01:35.390 --> 01:39.486
TERESA: Look what they did to Lil T and Tonto.

01:39.530 --> 01:42.044
POTE: Thosecabrones
hit us first.

01:42.100 --> 01:44.000
TERESA: So we hit them back.

01:44.060 --> 01:46.403
JAMES: Pecas will be expecting retaliation.

01:46.450 --> 01:48.315
So will the rest of
the Comisin.

01:48.360 --> 01:50.578
We need to take them all at once.

01:50.630 --> 01:52.848
TERESA: Bedoya is the weak link.

01:52.890 --> 01:55.541
JAMES: He owns a mattress
shop--he's vulnerable.

01:55.590 --> 01:57.808
It won't be easy to get to the others.

02:00.990 --> 02:04.244
TERESA: We need leverage. JAMES: We'll set him up.

02:04.290 --> 02:07.202
Pote and I will make a drop off at Bedoya's shop.

02:07.250 --> 02:09.855
TERESA: He'll bring them to us.

02:17.090 --> 02:19.251
Thank you.

02:19.310 --> 02:21.039
There she is.
Damn, little mama.

02:21.090 --> 02:23.433
You clean up nicely.
I like that dress.

02:23.490 --> 02:26.357
Thank you.
I like yours, too.

02:26.400 --> 02:28.356
This reminds me
of the day we first met.

02:28.400 --> 02:30.311
All these rich white people.

02:30.360 --> 02:33.238
You were one of them,
remember?

02:33.280 --> 02:34.759
How was I supposed
to know one day,

02:34.800 --> 02:36.665
_ we'd be
runnIng a wmery together?

02:36.720 --> 02:39.587
[soft piano music]

02:39.630 --> 02:42.542
Welcome. _
Name and affiliation, ladies.

02:42.590 --> 02:44.239
Priscilla Haines, representing

02:44.290 --> 02:46.372
the Women Entrepreneurs
for Progress.

02:46.420 --> 02:49.685
-Teresa Herrera.
-Thank you.

02:49.730 --> 02:51.686
CARSON: [laughs]

02:53.910 --> 02:55.639
Well, I tell you that story,
because after that,

02:55.690 --> 02:58.420
I thought I had had my fill
of fighting in Afghanistan.

02:58.480 --> 03:01.381
When I found myself back home,
I was fighting again.

03:01.440 --> 03:03.431
This time, for the people
of Maricopa County,

03:03.480 --> 03:05.266
as their district attorney.

03:05.310 --> 03:09.007
And as your next Senator,
I pledge to you that next time,

03:09.050 --> 03:10.836
I'll be fighting for
the entire state of Arizona.

03:10.880 --> 03:14.099
[cheers and applause]

03:14.150 --> 03:15.663
I know we're down
in the last week.

03:15.710 --> 03:18.099
I can't do it alone.
I'm going to need your help.

03:18.150 --> 03:19.230
So thank you all
for coming out.

03:19.280 --> 03:20.713
Please enjoy yourselves.

03:20.760 --> 03:23.888
[cheers and applause]

03:23.940 --> 03:27.023
He's your key to Phoenix,

03:27.070 --> 03:29.459
and that is how you're going
to take down the Comisin.

03:29.510 --> 03:32.468
[dramatic music]

03:35.560 --> 03:38.552

[phone beeps]

04:07.720 --> 04:09.540
[phone rings]

04:09.590 --> 04:12.411
CORTEZ: [speaking Spanish]

04:17.900 --> 04:19.811
Isabela.

04:24.520 --> 04:27.387
Isabela, I had nothing
to do with it.

04:27.440 --> 04:32.343
You have to believe me.
Isabela, please.

04:32.400 --> 04:33.958
I have nothing to say to you

04:34.010 --> 04:36.001
unless you're going
to tell me the truth.

04:36.050 --> 04:38.006
[tense music]

04:39.710 --> 04:42.964
I gave Cortez the order
to kidnap Kique.

04:43.020 --> 04:45.318
To bring his father
out of hiding.

04:45.370 --> 04:47.406
I never gave the order
to kill him.

04:47.460 --> 04:49.542
I would never do something
like that to you, Isabela.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.581
If you didn't kill him,
who did?

04:51.630 --> 04:53.234
Cortez.

04:53.290 --> 04:56.589
I never should
have trusted him.

04:56.640 --> 04:58.676
I should have listened to you.

04:58.730 --> 05:00.686
And now, I'm paying
the price for this.

05:00.730 --> 05:04.166
Why hurt Kique?
It doesn't make sense.

05:04.210 --> 05:07.475
Cortez wants to turn you and
everybody else against me.

05:07.520 --> 05:12.469
Cortez wants me out,
so he can take my business.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.397
What are you going to do?

05:14.440 --> 05:17.614
[sighs]

05:17.660 --> 05:20.265
I'll move against him soon.

05:20.320 --> 05:24.962
All I know is that now...

05:25.020 --> 05:27.363
You and I...

05:27.410 --> 05:29.537
we can only trust each other.

05:29.590 --> 05:32.536
[tense music]

05:34.500 --> 05:36.502
Let me do a press conference.

05:36.550 --> 05:39.246
Kique was my fianc.

05:39.290 --> 05:42.726
If I defend you,
maybe that will help.

05:42.770 --> 05:47.719
I'll do it at the orphanage.
That will make a statement.

05:47.780 --> 05:51.295
That will work.

05:51.350 --> 05:54.387
Thank you.

05:54.440 --> 05:56.567
We have to spin this, Mami.

05:56.610 --> 05:59.261
If what you say
about Cortez is true,

05:59.310 --> 06:00.823
we have to fight back.

06:00.880 --> 06:03.519
[tense music]

06:03.580 --> 06:05.525
I'm so sorry.

06:10.320 --> 06:12.663
[indistinct chatter]

06:12.720 --> 06:15.848
[phone vibrates]

06:15.890 --> 06:17.676
-Hey.
JAMES: It's me.

06:17.720 --> 06:20.769
We're at Bedoya's shopping.
We're making the dropoff now.

06:20.810 --> 06:23.677
Plan's in motion. _
He won't see this coming.

06:23.730 --> 06:25.891
Okay, be careful.

06:25.950 --> 06:27.759
-You too.
TERESA: Bye.

06:27.820 --> 06:30.778
[dramatic music]

06:34.560 --> 06:36.471
Hey.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.958
[grunts]

06:44.570 --> 06:48.609
That's Judge Jack Garvey.
He's a Democratic Committeeman.

06:48.660 --> 06:50.878
I need to speak
with Carson alone.

06:50.930 --> 06:52.579
Girl, I'm on it.

06:52.620 --> 06:54.838
[indistinct chatter]

06:54.890 --> 06:56.585
Yeah, well,
it's the redistricting.

06:56.630 --> 06:58.586
-That's what's killing us.
-You are preaching

06:58.630 --> 07:00.495
to the choir, but there's not a
damn thing you can do about it.

07:00.550 --> 07:03.508
-Yeah, well--
-Judge Garvey, how are you?

07:03.550 --> 07:06.724
Uh, I'm sorry, have we met?

07:06.770 --> 07:07.634
I'm sorry,
where are my manners?

07:07.680 --> 07:09.238
I'm Priscilla Haines.

07:09.290 --> 07:11.019
This is my good friend
Teresa Herrera.

07:11.080 --> 07:14.379
-Pleasure to meet you, sir.
-Hi, I'm Judge Jack Garvey.

07:14.430 --> 07:17.251
Oh, and uh, you probably know
our man of the hour.

07:17.300 --> 07:19.120
District Attorney Theo Carson.

07:19.170 --> 07:21.309
And with a little luck,
our next Senator.

07:21.350 --> 07:23.523
-How do you do, ladies?
-Nice to meet you.

07:23.570 --> 07:25.879
-Thank you so much for coming.
-Of course.

07:25.920 --> 07:27.876
Listen, Judge Garvey,
I would love to pick your brain

07:27.920 --> 07:31.526
about the small business ballot
measure in the East Valley.

07:31.580 --> 07:35.402
Um, I noticed
that your drink is empty.

07:35.450 --> 07:37.498
What do you say
we get you rehydrated first?

07:37.540 --> 07:39.496
Okay.

07:39.540 --> 07:42.498
[soft piano music]

07:42.540 --> 07:44.758
Why do I feel like we just got
set up on a blind date?

07:44.810 --> 07:46.710
[laughs]

07:46.770 --> 07:48.499
Okay, I think you
might have rescued me,

07:48.550 --> 07:50.541
because that old man can
listen to himself talk all day.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.943
What politician doesn't?

07:52.990 --> 07:55.550
[both laugh]

07:55.600 --> 07:57.989
And what is it that you do,
Ms. Herrera?

07:58.040 --> 08:01.077
Have you heard of
the Perla Blanca vineyards?

08:03.610 --> 08:05.737
I own it.

08:05.780 --> 08:09.955
I think I can help you
with your campaign.

08:10.010 --> 08:12.570
I think this is a good time to
loop in my campaign manager.

08:12.620 --> 08:15.088
I'd like to keep this
between us, if possible.

08:15.140 --> 08:18.359
And Mrs. Judge Garvey III
has returned, awkward.

08:18.410 --> 08:19.661
[sniffs]

08:19.710 --> 08:21.792
Excuse me, guys.
These darn allergies.

08:21.840 --> 08:23.239
[sniff]

08:23.280 --> 08:25.236
Um, you might want to
take care of your friend.

08:25.280 --> 08:27.407
She's pretty loaded.

08:27.460 --> 08:29.803
It's been a pleasure, ladies.
Will you please excuse me?

08:29.850 --> 08:31.579
Sure.

08:34.770 --> 08:37.898
-What?
-Let's go to the restroom.

08:37.950 --> 08:39.508
Okay.

08:46.260 --> 08:48.774
-You're high.
-What?

08:48.830 --> 08:50.786
-No.
-Don't lie to me.

08:50.830 --> 08:52.559
You've been using.

08:52.610 --> 08:55.693
I--I took like,
a couple of bumps.

08:55.750 --> 08:58.833
But I've been having
these, like, panic attacks

08:58.880 --> 09:00.962
ever since those people
came to the winery.

09:01.010 --> 09:02.966
I mean, they wine-boarded me,
for God sake.

09:03.020 --> 09:06.399
I just was doing a little bit
to take the edge off.

09:06.450 --> 09:08.270
I don't know,
maybe that's just an excuse.

09:08.330 --> 09:09.627
But I'm sorry.
I'll pay you back for--

09:09.670 --> 09:12.412
I don't care about the money.

09:12.460 --> 09:14.416
This deal is important
for all of us.

09:14.460 --> 09:17.247
-You know what's at stake.
-I know.

09:17.290 --> 09:20.464
So don't talk to anyone, okay?
Go back to the house.

09:20.510 --> 09:23.684
You have to
get your head clear.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.163
I'll talk to you soon.

09:25.210 --> 09:27.644
[door opens]

09:27.690 --> 09:29.476
[door shuts]

09:30.650 --> 09:33.869
[exhales]

09:33.920 --> 09:35.694
Okay.

09:35.740 --> 09:38.823
My orders were very specific.
Kique was not to be harmed.

09:38.880 --> 09:42.316
And I told you, he wasn't.
Not by me nor by any of my men.

09:44.320 --> 09:46.880
the intent was clearly to sully
you in the eyes of the public.

09:46.930 --> 09:48.318
You know this was Teresa.

09:48.370 --> 09:50.531
Teresa will never come back
to MeXIco again.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.273
If she has, then we have

09:52.330 --> 09:54.673
the perfect way
to strike against her.

09:56.370 --> 09:59.328
[tense music]

10:04.160 --> 10:06.242
[indistinct Spanish chatter]

10:06.300 --> 10:07.904
CAMILA: The Colombians
are concerned

10:07.950 --> 10:09.998
about the attention Kique's
death is drawing to me.

10:10.040 --> 10:12.679
Castel wants to meet.

10:12.740 --> 10:14.128
CORTEZ: This won't take long.

10:14.170 --> 10:17.128
[dramatic music]

10:20.750 --> 10:24.652
You know, my daddy died
in a nuthouse.

10:24.710 --> 10:29.056
And General Alligator Face here
thinks he's calling the shots.

10:29.100 --> 10:31.489
It's nice to have
an adult to deal with.

10:31.540 --> 10:36.102
Go on now, run along.
Your momma's here.

10:36.150 --> 10:38.584
Oh, bring it, gator boy.

10:42.200 --> 10:44.156
The General _
tells me you have information

10:44.200 --> 10:45.849
about Teresa Mendoza.

10:45.900 --> 10:51.031
Well, since we're finished
with all the pleasantries,

10:51.080 --> 10:56.734
let's, uh, open the door
to negotiations, shall we?

10:56.780 --> 10:59.738
[dramatic music]

11:05.920 --> 11:07.911
Let's.

11:15.150 --> 11:17.539
[indistinct chatter]

11:17.580 --> 11:20.754
Okay, I'm going to be there
in two seconds.

11:20.810 --> 11:22.323
Drink?

11:22.370 --> 11:24.065
[chuckles]

11:24.110 --> 11:27.068
It's an Old Fashioned.
That's a good guess.

11:27.120 --> 11:31.636
I saw you drinking one earlier.
Single batch bourbon.

11:31.690 --> 11:32.816
Salud.

11:32.860 --> 11:33.986
[glasses clink]

11:34.040 --> 11:35.769
Salud.

11:35.820 --> 11:38.732
Listen, I apologize if my
friend made you uncomfortable.

11:38.780 --> 11:41.601
I'm curious.
I would like to know why

11:41.650 --> 11:43.868
you are so interested
in helping me.

11:43.920 --> 11:46.787
I'm new to this country.

11:46.830 --> 11:48.741
I would like to write you
a $200,000--

11:48.790 --> 11:51.008
You should contact
my campaign headquarters.

11:51.050 --> 11:53.871
Ask for Janice.
Thanks again.

11:53.930 --> 11:56.615
I have something that will
help you win this election.

11:56.670 --> 11:58.092
Something better than money.

11:58.150 --> 12:00.106
[tense music]

12:00.150 --> 12:02.584
And what is it
you'd like in return?

12:02.630 --> 12:05.326
To be friends.
Help each other.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.803
I'd need to hear more details.

12:09.850 --> 12:12.410
But I'm open to
further discussion.

12:14.860 --> 12:17.499
-It was nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

12:28.610 --> 12:29.781
[chuckles]

12:29.830 --> 12:31.878
Right where I said it was,
wasn't it?

12:31.920 --> 12:33.785
You think we need your weapons?

12:33.840 --> 12:35.444
I think you need
the kind of spin

12:35.490 --> 12:36.969
something like this
would give you.

12:37.010 --> 12:39.444
Uncle Sam loses high grade

12:39.490 --> 12:42.493
military arsenal
on Mexican land.

12:42.540 --> 12:44.576
Returned by a hot-ass governor

12:44.630 --> 12:47.849
who fights corruption
and looks good doing it.

12:47.890 --> 12:50.973
Gets your rep out
of the shitter.

12:52.980 --> 12:55.801
I can see you
thought this through.

12:55.860 --> 13:01.298
-What are Your Majesty's terms?
-Well, I only got two.

13:01.340 --> 13:04.514
I want out of this
cuckoo's nest,

13:04.560 --> 13:07.734
and I want my man,
Bilal, brought to me.

13:07.780 --> 13:11.511
I have a condition of my own.
It's non-negotiable.

13:11.570 --> 13:15.654
Let me guess.
Teresa Mendoza?

13:15.700 --> 13:18.430
I want the details
of her operation.

13:18.490 --> 13:22.449
She's part of this deal,
or there is no deal.

13:22.490 --> 13:27.052
You bring me my number two,
spring us out of here,

13:27.110 --> 13:28.884
I'll tell you anything
you want to know.

13:28.930 --> 13:31.888
[dramatic music]

13:33.550 --> 13:36.018
You have no loyalty to her?

13:36.070 --> 13:40.894
I'm a pirate, madam.
Not a saint.

13:40.950 --> 13:42.850
I'll be in touch.

13:42.900 --> 13:47.724
Take me to my car.

13:47.780 --> 13:52.558
She looks just as good going,
huh, General?

13:52.610 --> 13:54.601
There goes the boss.

14:01.180 --> 14:04.308
You playing the long game,
Your Highness?

14:04.360 --> 14:07.056
Tossing us scraps
while you protect

14:07.100 --> 14:10.888
that bitch that feeds you?

14:10.930 --> 14:13.012
Now, is this some kind of
psychopathic courtship?

14:13.060 --> 14:17.360
Because I'm digging it.
I like a man in uniform.

14:17.420 --> 14:20.583
But you already have a man
in your life, Mr. Megalos.

14:20.640 --> 14:22.028
You'll be happy to know

14:22.070 --> 14:25.153
that your first request
has been granted.

14:25.210 --> 14:30.034
Your Somali friend, he's
already on the premises.

14:34.220 --> 14:35.949
Bilal's here?

14:36.000 --> 14:38.127
Mas o menos.

14:38.180 --> 14:41.172
[tense music]

14:43.140 --> 14:45.176
Bilal.

14:45.230 --> 14:48.791
Don't worry, brother, we're
going to get you out of here.

14:48.840 --> 14:50.831
[grunting]

14:50.890 --> 14:52.881
Bilal?

14:54.370 --> 14:57.271
It's me.
It's George.

14:57.330 --> 15:00.015
What the hell
did you do to him?

15:00.070 --> 15:01.844
CORTEZ:
He was having trouble,

15:01.900 --> 15:03.982
so he_ needed
some speCIal treatment.

15:04.030 --> 15:06.988
[dramatic music]

15:10.470 --> 15:13.519
You...

15:13.560 --> 15:15.869
you sick bastard.

15:18.220 --> 15:20.085
I'm going to kill you!

15:20.130 --> 15:21.825
I'm going to
rip that lizard face

15:21.870 --> 15:24.657
right off your goddamn skull!

15:24.700 --> 15:27.965
You can bullshit the governor,
but you can't bullshit me.

15:28.010 --> 15:32.003
I know what loyalty means
to a man like you.

15:32.060 --> 15:33.664
I'm curious,

15:33.710 --> 15:36.224
how many layers of skin
I'll need to peel back

15:36.280 --> 15:39.841
until you're no longer
that same man.

15:39.890 --> 15:42.199
I guess we'll see.

15:42.240 --> 15:46.062
Your death's
going to be dark, General.

15:46.110 --> 15:48.328
Pitch black, I have it my way.

15:48.380 --> 15:52.988
Oh, don't try and charm me,
Your Majesty.

15:53.030 --> 15:58.036
You won't get off so easy.
Not like your mayatesidekick.

15:58.080 --> 16:00.128
-Bilal, it's going to be okay.
-[wails indistinctly]

16:00.170 --> 16:02.161
-I'll be coming for you!
-[grunts]

16:02.220 --> 16:04.472
-Take him.
-[yells]

16:04.520 --> 16:07.694

16:12.750 --> 16:15.571
[phone buzzes]

16:15.620 --> 16:19.704
-Hey, did they get Bedoya?
-It's going down now.

16:19.760 --> 16:22.718
[dramatic music]

16:26.420 --> 16:29.105
Keep your hands up!
Don't move!

16:29.160 --> 16:31.503
What the hell is this?
You guys got a warrant?

16:31.550 --> 16:33.279
Hey, I'm talking to you, man.
What do you want?

16:35.290 --> 16:39.033
Come on, man.
You going to pay for that?

16:39.080 --> 16:42.425
No way,
that ain't mine, all right?

16:42.470 --> 16:46.292
No, no, no, no.
That's not mine.

16:46.350 --> 16:49.080
-You're with Mayo, right?
-Take him.

16:49.130 --> 16:53.043
This is a setup, man.
All right, this ain't my stuff.

16:53.090 --> 16:54.819
They're setting me up.

16:54.880 --> 16:57.838
[blues rock]

17:04.370 --> 17:06.406
Teresa.

17:06.460 --> 17:09.839
-Hey.
-Yeah, have a seat, join us.

17:09.890 --> 17:12.279
Here we are, we're the Three
Horseman of the Apocalypse,

17:12.330 --> 17:13.888
and one Horsewoman.

17:13.940 --> 17:15.453
[laughs]

17:15.510 --> 17:17.546
Which one you think
you are, Teresa?

17:17.600 --> 17:21.115
Pestilence, probably.
Maybe Death.

17:21.170 --> 17:24.207
This one here can't be Famine,
I know that.

17:24.260 --> 17:26.512
[grunts]

17:26.560 --> 17:29.347
[both speak Spanish]

17:29.390 --> 17:32.086
Just watch the door.

17:32.130 --> 17:34.826
Con gusto.

17:36.620 --> 17:38.224
No sense of humor.

17:38.270 --> 17:40.090
Bedoya's in the county jail.

17:40.140 --> 17:42.096
We got him
right where we want him.

17:42.140 --> 17:43.960
One down, four to go.

17:44.010 --> 17:48.754
Your men did a good job.
Thank you.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.665
Yeah, I see which way
the wind's blowing.

17:50.720 --> 17:54.235
I just made the smart choice.
I got to say, though.

17:54.290 --> 17:56.508
Kinda surprised at you.

17:56.550 --> 17:59.986
It wasn't so long ago you were
all up on your high horse

18:00.030 --> 18:02.464
bleeding your heart
about that kid in my jail.

18:02.510 --> 18:04.375
Now look at you.

18:04.430 --> 18:09.811
Sitting here right with me, and
we're doing business together.

18:09.870 --> 18:12.384
[sniffs]

18:12.430 --> 18:15.342
Kind of disappointing,
in a way.

18:19.220 --> 18:22.519
Everybody has their price.

18:22.570 --> 18:27.269
I guess yours was Phoenix.
This is on me.

18:31.240 --> 18:32.969
JAMES: [clears throat]

18:33.020 --> 18:36.194
-How'd it go with the DA?
-I think he's onboard.

18:36.240 --> 18:39.585
-Have we heard from George?
-Not since Guaymas.

18:39.640 --> 18:42.541
He's been off-grid, I just
can't get a hold of him.

18:42.590 --> 18:45.411
-We need to find him.
-I'll stay on it.

18:45.470 --> 18:47.370
Go get Bedoya.

18:47.430 --> 18:49.421
[birds caw]

18:57.260 --> 18:59.433
-What the hell is this?
-Get in.

18:59.480 --> 19:02.438
[tense music]

19:07.270 --> 19:08.521
What the hell
are you doing here?

19:08.580 --> 19:10.400
-I got you out.
-You?

19:10.450 --> 19:12.179
[chuckles]

19:12.230 --> 19:13.572
Judge kicked the case.

19:13.630 --> 19:15.757
TERESA: DA Carson
chose not to file it.

19:15.800 --> 19:17.711
The sheriff
didn't have a warrant.

19:19.460 --> 19:22.099
You do know how
this is going to look, right?

19:22.160 --> 19:24.628
Like you cut a deal
with the DA to save yourself.

19:27.470 --> 19:31.895
-You set me up.
-You should be more careful.

19:31.950 --> 19:33.201
[exhales]

19:33.250 --> 19:34.774
What the hell do you want
from me, Teresa?

19:34.820 --> 19:36.469
I want La Comisin.

19:36.520 --> 19:38.215
You're going to
help deliver them.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.251
[engine starts]

19:40.300 --> 19:43.303
[dramatic music]

19:50.050 --> 19:53.269
I have requested this meeting
because my uncle is very upset.

19:53.320 --> 19:54.571
With Boaz on the run,
and you getting

19:54.620 --> 19:55.928
dragged through the mud,
business here has

19:55.970 --> 19:57.665
nearly come to a standstill.

19:57.710 --> 19:59.928
We're losing money
because you persisted

19:59.980 --> 20:01.459
_in a war _
we adVIsed you against.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.673
Let me remind you, Castel,
that Reynaldo

20:03.720 --> 20:05.893
gave me his blessing
on the attack on Boaz.

20:05.940 --> 20:08.283
Kique was unfortunately
collateral damage.

20:08.330 --> 20:10.241
Ladies, I am certain
we can figure out

20:10.290 --> 20:12.076
a solution to this together.

20:12.120 --> 20:15.419
I've set up a press conference.
That will take care of it.

20:15.470 --> 20:18.075
-I always do.
-Yeah, well.

20:18.120 --> 20:20.293
Confidence and trust
are hard things

20:20.340 --> 20:22.342
to win back
once they've been lost.

20:22.390 --> 20:24.301
Making decisions
based on emotions

20:24.350 --> 20:25.908
is never good business, Camila.

20:25.960 --> 20:28.269
-Excuse me?
-This business is changing.

20:28.310 --> 20:31.177
The days of narcos
praying to Malverde,

20:31.230 --> 20:33.437
and asking advice
from misticos?

20:33.490 --> 20:36.186
-Those days are done.
-Indeed.

20:36.230 --> 20:38.744
Cocainais a
multi-billion dollar industry,

20:38.800 --> 20:42.145
so it needs to be managed
with more sophistication.

20:42.190 --> 20:44.181
[tense music]

20:44.240 --> 20:47.676
You're right, Castel.
Thank you.

20:47.720 --> 20:49.938
Please tell Reynaldo that
his concerns have been heard.

20:49.980 --> 20:51.197
-I will.
-And now,

20:51.250 --> 20:52.717
if you'll excuse me.

La Comisin,
they're willing to meet.

22:07.320 --> 22:09.402
I told them I would
hand you over to them.

22:09.450 --> 22:13.750
I'll do this, and me and you,
we're good, right?

22:13.810 --> 22:16.415
Yes, you and I
will be partners

22:16.460 --> 22:18.189
along with Taza.

22:18.240 --> 22:21.152
[dramatic music]

22:21.200 --> 22:23.373
To partnership.

22:31.300 --> 22:33.860
[speaks Spanish]

22:33.910 --> 22:37.437
All set, then.

22:37.480 --> 22:39.607
Take Pote with you.

22:39.660 --> 22:43.221
We succeed, we're free
to run Phoenix how we want.

22:43.270 --> 22:46.831
We'll be the only game in town,
and we'll do it together.

22:46.880 --> 22:52.318
I hope so.
I'll see you soon.

22:52.370 --> 22:54.406

25:15.420 --> 25:17.468
Thank you.

25:19.030 --> 25:22.557
Look, I screwed up yesterday.
I totally admit that.

25:22.600 --> 25:25.160
I want you to know
you can count on me.

25:25.210 --> 25:28.828
You're my only friend left.

25:28.870 --> 25:30.826
I mean, I don't have
anybody else.

25:30.870 --> 25:32.121
I don't want to lose you, too.

to get picked up.

when they get there.

what's going on,

25:52.110 --> 25:54.806

want to know anything,

I got to ask.

After what happened to me
at the winery,

going to meet Pecas

26:36.110 --> 26:39.284
and the rest of the Comisin.
We'll hit them all at once.

26:50.260 --> 26:55.516
What Devon did to you
at the winery was terrible.

26:55.570 --> 26:59.688
I'm in this business
to stop people like him

26:59.740 --> 27:03.744

27:03.790 --> 27:06.657
Or if I live.

27:19.590 --> 27:22.058

We're on their tail.

Pecas wasn't there
when we showed up.

30:54.150 --> 30:55.879
I mean, we just
shot the place up.

30:55.940 --> 30:57.146
If that cabron
finds out what happened,

Well, we need to find him
before that happens.

31:00.420 --> 31:02.240
We will.
What about Bedoya?

31:02.290 --> 31:04.110
He was hit, but not by us.

31:04.160 --> 31:05.240
Someone must have
tipped Pecas off.

Someone?

-Okay, we must get Mayo.

31:20.960 --> 31:25.044
But first, Pecas needs to go.

31:25.100 --> 31:28.058
MAYO: My men and I
will drive you to the border.

31:28.100 --> 31:30.261
After that, you're on your own.

31:30.320 --> 31:32.572
I expect a call from you
before the week is out

through that bitch's heart.

31:35.110 --> 31:37.146
Now, it's you want me
to do what you couldn't.

31:37.190 --> 31:38.976
And I'm gonna keep
that in mind.

31:39.020 --> 31:41.102
[door grates open]

31:45.860 --> 31:48.158

31:56.390 --> 31:59.609
Mayo, you motherless snake.
You set me up.

31:59.650 --> 32:02.175
What can I say, Pecas?
She pays better.

32:02.220 --> 32:04.563
I never liked you much, anyway.

32:04.610 --> 32:06.999
Ain't nobody going to trust
a red-headed Mexican.

32:12.230 --> 32:15.404
Mera, mera.

32:15.450 --> 32:19.238
I underestimated you
from the start, didn't I?

32:19.280 --> 32:21.100
You know, if I didn't
want so badly

32:21.150 --> 32:25.029
to squeeze your throat
until your eyes popped out,

32:25.070 --> 32:28.244
I might make
an honest woman out of you.

32:28.290 --> 32:29.985
It's a joke.

32:30.030 --> 32:32.464

I'm just--

32:37.250 --> 32:39.070

That's grand.

32:41.610 --> 32:43.646
Let's call it a draw.

32:43.700 --> 32:45.349
Huh? You and me,
we can run La Comisin

32:45.390 --> 32:47.346
like it should have
been run all along.

32:47.400 --> 32:49.209
A smart business.
Innovation.

32:49.270 --> 32:53.354
I'm tired of being the only one
with any vision around here.

32:56.270 --> 32:58.921
Of course, the three of us,
equal partners.

32:58.970 --> 33:01.404
Do you see this, huh?

33:01.450 --> 33:03.236
We're already talking.

33:05.500 --> 33:07.491
[speaking Spanish]

33:09.240 --> 33:11.288
Make a deal with me.

33:14.120 --> 33:16.076
We made a deal.

33:16.120 --> 33:20.159
You broke it when you sold me
to Camila Vargas.

33:20.210 --> 33:23.680
You would have done
the same thing.

33:23.740 --> 33:25.958
-No, I wouldn't.
-No?

33:26.000 --> 33:28.309
Then you're an idiot.

33:41.540 --> 33:43.929
What?

33:43.970 --> 33:47.269
You think you're going
to make me beg for my life?

33:47.320 --> 33:48.628
[laughs]

33:48.670 --> 33:51.013
That's not going to happen.

33:57.380 --> 33:59.940
I don't knee! to bitches.

33:59.990 --> 34:02.208
Adios, puta.
I'll see you in Hell--

34:02.250 --> 34:04.241
[grunting]

34:08.260 --> 34:11.127
And then, there were none.

34:11.170 --> 34:14.253
He was never going to show up
to your little deer trap.

34:14.310 --> 34:16.949
Not in his nature.

after the fight is over,

34:20.970 --> 34:24.576

on the ground.

34:24.620 --> 34:28.317
He trusted you, though.

No one else to turn to.
You know what that's like.

in the desert.

34:46.950 --> 34:51.125
It's right next
to your reporter.

don't you think?

when things were good.

extricate yourself from her,

But I'm her daughter.
I'm all she has.

35:43.480 --> 35:46.301

your father is gone.

this busmess,

back into it.

drag you down to the grave.

the Latino vote will follow.

we should be cautious
