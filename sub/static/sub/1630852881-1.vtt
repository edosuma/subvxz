00:14.139 --> 00:15.307
Who are you?

00:26.151 --> 00:27.152
Who are you?

00:49.716 --> 00:50.717
Hello?

00:58.100 --> 01:00.269
I'm sorry, I got ahead of myself.

01:02.187 --> 01:04.313
Hi there, you on the table.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.650
I wonder if you'd mind
taking a brief survey.

01:07.943 --> 01:08.944
Who is that?

01:09.486 --> 01:10.487
Five questions.

01:10.571 --> 01:11.864
Now, I know you're sleepy,

01:11.947 --> 01:15.325
but I just bet
it'll make you feel right as rain.

01:16.451 --> 01:17.828
Who's speaking?

01:27.379 --> 01:28.380
Oh, God.

01:37.514 --> 01:40.517
Hey! Open the door!

01:47.441 --> 01:50.694
I'd be just thrilled to chat
once we've run the survey.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.030
Shall we begin with question one?

01:54.406 --> 01:55.908
I'm not taking your survey.

01:57.075 --> 01:59.328
Shall we begin with question one?

02:02.998 --> 02:04.124
Let me out of here.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.086
Hey!

02:10.881 --> 02:12.174
Open the door!

02:13.133 --> 02:14.134
Fuck.

02:15.469 --> 02:18.096
Hey! Let me out!

02:41.245 --> 02:42.246
Hey.

02:44.039 --> 02:45.040
Hello.

02:46.041 --> 02:47.167
Five questions?

02:48.627 --> 02:49.753
Five questions.

02:51.088 --> 02:52.339
What do I get at the end?

02:54.967 --> 02:56.301
Depends on your answers.

02:59.763 --> 03:00.764
Okay.

03:01.640 --> 03:03.016
Great. Off we go.

03:03.517 --> 03:06.019
Now to start, who are you?

03:06.770 --> 03:08.522
That's the first question?

03:09.147 --> 03:10.399
First name will do.

03:24.872 --> 03:25.873
I don't…

03:26.957 --> 03:28.417
It's okay.

03:28.500 --> 03:31.545
If you can't answer the question,
feel free to say, "unknown."

03:32.921 --> 03:34.089
What is this?

03:34.173 --> 03:35.424
Okay, unknown.

03:35.507 --> 03:39.761
Question two, in which US state
or territory were you born?

03:39.845 --> 03:42.014
- Wait.
- Which state or territory, please?

03:42.097 --> 03:44.183
- I don't know.
- Unknown.

03:44.266 --> 03:48.437
Question three,
please name any US state or territory.

03:48.520 --> 03:49.897
- Fuck. I--
- First that comes to mind.

03:49.980 --> 03:52.858
- I don't know. Delaware. What is this?
- Delaware.

03:52.941 --> 03:57.070
Question four,
what is Mr. Eagan's favorite breakfast?

03:57.154 --> 03:58.864
I don't-- That one makes no sense.

03:58.947 --> 04:01.325
Right? Unknown. Question five.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.994
And as a reminder,
this is the final question.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.370
To the best of your memory,

04:05.454 --> 04:09.416
what is or was the color
of your mother's eyes?

04:27.434 --> 04:29.686
Okay, what's hap-- What's happening?

04:29.770 --> 04:31.146
Unknown.

04:31.230 --> 04:37.110
So that's unknown,
unknown, Delaware, unknown, unknown.

04:38.403 --> 04:39.905
What the hell did you do to me?

04:51.458 --> 04:53.001
That's a perfect score.

06:49.868 --> 06:51.495
Are you ready for Mr. Scout?

07:00.420 --> 07:01.421
Thank you.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.134
Go ahead.

08:31.929 --> 08:32.929
Mr. Scout.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.014
Hi, Judd.

08:44.900 --> 08:47.528
- All right, see you this evening.
- Yep, see you soon.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.886
- You're breathing shitty.
- Sorry.

11:17.970 --> 11:19.137
You sick?

11:19.221 --> 11:21.390
Maybe. Petey was sniffling yesterday.

11:21.974 --> 11:23.851
If you breathe on me,
I'll rip your larynx out.

11:23.934 --> 11:26.353
Wow. That went right to ten.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.647
I feel like
ripping out my germ-ridden larynx

11:28.730 --> 11:31.358
would get you sicker
than just me breathing on you.

11:31.441 --> 11:33.068
Nah. Endorphins.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.781
Petey better not be out for the day,
'cause I'm about zero seconds

11:37.865 --> 11:40.701
from wrapping the Tumwater file,
and he needs to process it.

11:40.784 --> 11:42.369
I think he's out.

11:43.245 --> 11:47.040
If he doesn't process today, they won't
know until Tuesday of next week.

11:47.124 --> 11:49.751
- It's typical Lumon bullshit.
- Careful, guy.

11:50.335 --> 11:52.129
Hi, kids. What's for dinner?

11:52.212 --> 11:54.047
Goddamn it, Irv. We warned you.

11:54.131 --> 11:55.716
About the greeting? You were kidding.

11:55.799 --> 11:59.761
No, we sincerely hate it.
How many reasons did we come up with?

12:00.470 --> 12:02.723
- Eight.
- Eight reasons.

12:02.806 --> 12:05.267
Chief among them the latent condescension.

12:05.350 --> 12:08.854
And it's confusing. Like, did the kids
make you dinner in this scenario? Or--

12:08.937 --> 12:10.939
Yeah. What kind of a shit dad are you?

12:12.441 --> 12:14.526
- No Petey?
- We think he's sick.

12:14.610 --> 12:17.446
Oh, no. And Dylan's
about to wrap Tumwater today.

12:17.529 --> 12:19.072
Yeah, and if he doesn't see me finish,

12:19.156 --> 12:21.158
I might get passed over
for refiner of the quarter

12:21.241 --> 12:22.951
and miss out on my goddamn waffle party.

12:23.035 --> 12:26.079
Grumble, grumble.
These perks are so out of hand.

12:26.163 --> 12:28.081
When we'd process a file in the old days,

12:28.165 --> 12:29.958
they'd shake our hand
and fill up the creamer.

12:30.042 --> 12:32.377
I still don't buy
they actually incentivized creamer.

12:32.461 --> 12:35.297
They did.
And back then, we were grateful for it.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.049
That's fucked, dude.

12:37.132 --> 12:38.759
Yes, very fucked.

12:38.842 --> 12:43.388
To put in an honest day's work and not
get a children's breakfast in return.

12:43.472 --> 12:45.766
Irv's got claws today.

12:46.767 --> 12:49.269
Good morning, Macrodata Refinement.

12:49.353 --> 12:50.562
Hi, Mr. Milchick.

12:51.647 --> 12:53.315
Mark, could I have a word?

13:23.387 --> 13:26.557
Last time you saw Ms. Cobel,
she was in her old office.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.100
Now she's in her new office.

13:28.684 --> 13:30.352
It's a completely different office.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.354
What's this about?

13:32.896 --> 13:33.897
She'd never say so,

13:33.981 --> 13:36.817
but I know a compliment about the office
would just make her day.

13:47.911 --> 13:50.247
Mark? Come in. Shut the thing.

13:51.290 --> 13:52.291
Nice office.

13:52.791 --> 13:54.042
It's horrid.

13:55.169 --> 13:56.920
Yeah, the old one was better.

14:04.553 --> 14:06.847
You look awful. You look hungover.

14:08.182 --> 14:09.266
Have a seat.

14:15.022 --> 14:17.024
The Board will be joining us
remotely today.

14:20.277 --> 14:22.362
I have Mark S. at my desk.

14:32.748 --> 14:33.874
Hello. You--

14:38.420 --> 14:41.215
I assume this is about me acting
as department chief today.

14:41.298 --> 14:44.468
Okay. Well… I mean,

14:44.551 --> 14:47.679
I've subbed for Petey before,
so it shouldn't be that big a thing.

14:47.763 --> 14:50.933
Petey is no longer with this company.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.060
I'm sorry?

14:54.478 --> 14:59.900
I said,
Petey is no longer with this company.

14:59.983 --> 15:04.279
I'm sorry, Mark. You guys were
one of my favorite office friendships.

15:06.532 --> 15:10.077
I mean, there should have been
some notice of this. What happened?

15:10.160 --> 15:11.286
We'd love to tell you,

15:11.370 --> 15:14.331
but unfortunately,
non-disclosure policy forbids.

15:14.414 --> 15:17.167
We'd be aiding an assault
on Petey's privacy by you.

15:20.838 --> 15:25.133
Mark, would you place your key card
on my desk?

15:29.888 --> 15:34.142
Mark S., at this time I confer upon you
the freedom to serve Kier

15:34.226 --> 15:37.896
in the advanced role
of Macrodata Refinement department chief.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.231
Congratulations.

15:49.283 --> 15:52.119
A handshake is available upon request.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.085
Thank you. May I have a handshake?

16:07.509 --> 16:11.054
I know you haven't run a training before,
but Irving will be there to shadow.

16:11.138 --> 16:15.601
Just stick to the flowchart and escalate
properly depending on dialectics.

16:15.684 --> 16:16.685
You'll be fine.

16:17.561 --> 16:19.646
- If you need to take a few minutes--
- Thank you. I don't.

16:23.525 --> 16:26.653
And thank you to the Board as well.

16:28.447 --> 16:33.493
The Board won't be contributing
to this meeting vocally.

16:43.837 --> 16:46.256
Our last refiner, who was a woman, was--

16:46.340 --> 16:47.883
Carol. Dylan's old seat.

16:51.011 --> 16:52.012
Don't be sad.

16:52.095 --> 16:54.723
I'm fine. We'll be fine.

16:54.806 --> 16:56.683
I know you and Petey were close.

16:56.767 --> 17:00.103
He was the only one
who really appreciated your humor.

17:00.187 --> 17:04.107
Everything's fine. So, I'm supposed
to start with just the input survey?

17:04.191 --> 17:05.400
Isn't that a little weird?

17:05.483 --> 17:06.527
It's standard.

17:06.609 --> 17:09.946
Just start at 1A and continue by line,
based on her answers.

17:10.030 --> 17:12.031
Well, what if I just talk to her?

17:12.115 --> 17:15.661
She deserves to have the information
presented to her in the proper order.

17:15.743 --> 17:17.162
Just as you had.

17:17.871 --> 17:22.960
"If the trainee becomes agitated
and demands to leave, skip to page 19."

17:24.127 --> 17:26.964
She has to ask three times
for you to let her.

17:27.047 --> 17:28.924
Right. Yes.

17:33.971 --> 17:35.639
Image is good.

17:36.890 --> 17:38.058
She looks nice.

17:39.101 --> 17:40.811
Okay. You're all set.

17:44.606 --> 17:46.942
I just love
seeing you all come in like this.

17:48.777 --> 17:50.153
Go on ahead when you're ready.

17:53.991 --> 17:55.367
- All right.
- Okay.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.041
There you go.

18:06.003 --> 18:07.004
Who are you?

18:16.597 --> 18:17.598
All right.

18:19.683 --> 18:21.018
Who are you?

18:26.857 --> 18:27.941
- Mark.
- What?

18:28.025 --> 18:29.526
You skipped the preamble.

18:30.152 --> 18:31.153
Hello?

18:31.695 --> 18:32.696
Shit!

18:36.783 --> 18:38.827
I'm sorry, I got ahead of myself.

18:42.539 --> 18:43.916
- That's it.
- Okay.

18:45.250 --> 18:46.793
Hi there, you on the table.

18:46.877 --> 18:49.546
I wonder if you'd mind
taking a brief survey.

18:51.673 --> 18:52.674
Who is that?

18:53.759 --> 18:54.927
Five questions.

18:55.010 --> 18:56.220
Now, I know you're sleepy,

18:56.303 --> 18:59.348
but I just bet
it'll make you feel right as rain.

19:01.058 --> 19:02.351
Who's speaking?

19:02.976 --> 19:04.394
"Who's speaking?"

19:17.032 --> 19:18.659
Hey! Open the door!

19:18.742 --> 19:20.035
Mark.

19:20.118 --> 19:22.913
I'd be just thrilled to chat,
once we've run the survey.

19:22.996 --> 19:24.206
Shall we begin with question one?

19:24.289 --> 19:26.250
I'm not taking your survey.

19:29.753 --> 19:31.922
Shall we begin with question one?

19:32.005 --> 19:34.049
Let me out of here. Hey!

19:37.719 --> 19:40.264
- Open the door!
- She's not supposed to do that.

19:40.848 --> 19:41.849
Hey!

19:41.932 --> 19:43.225
She's going to break in.

19:43.308 --> 19:44.893
- Let me out!
- No, she's not.

19:46.270 --> 19:47.479
Are you seeing this?

19:48.981 --> 19:49.982
I'm watching.

19:51.233 --> 19:52.442
Should I help?

19:54.403 --> 19:55.445
You should not.

20:02.870 --> 20:04.538
That's a perfect score.

20:05.998 --> 20:09.626
Now, I think I know where
our disconnect is coming from.

20:10.711 --> 20:13.255
- What?
- Well, there was a preamble,

20:13.338 --> 20:15.883
which I was supposed to read
before the survey,

20:15.966 --> 20:18.510
to lead into the questions and…

20:19.511 --> 20:22.222
But I unfortunately skipped that
and went straight into the survey.

20:22.306 --> 20:23.348
Am I livestock?

20:24.349 --> 20:25.350
I'm sorry?

20:26.602 --> 20:30.522
Like, did you grow me as food
and that's why I have no memories?

20:33.108 --> 20:38.197
You think we grew a full human,
gave you consciousness…

20:38.280 --> 20:39.865
- I don't know.
- …did your nails and--

20:39.948 --> 20:41.200
I don't know. I don't know you.

20:41.283 --> 20:43.493
No, you're not livestock. Good Lord.

20:44.161 --> 20:45.579
Then what's my name?

20:47.122 --> 20:48.123
Helly.

20:48.624 --> 20:51.251
Your name is Helly. Helly R.

20:52.669 --> 20:53.670
Please.

21:08.268 --> 21:10.187
Thank you for taking the welcome survey.

21:10.270 --> 21:14.274
I can sense that the questions
made you feel afraid or disoriented.

21:14.358 --> 21:18.695
Well, the good news is,
you're at an orientation.

21:25.827 --> 21:27.955
You see, you have been hired to a position

21:28.038 --> 21:31.083
on the severed floor of Lumon Industries.

21:31.708 --> 21:32.835
The what floor?

21:44.930 --> 21:48.559
I understand you're confused
about the severance procedure.

21:49.101 --> 21:50.853
Before we hop on that,

21:50.936 --> 21:55.607
let's chat about something I bet
you have heard of, the work/life balance.

21:56.567 --> 21:58.652
To start, imagine yourself as a seesaw.

22:01.238 --> 22:02.531
Fuck!

22:02.614 --> 22:04.700
That locks from out there!

22:04.783 --> 22:06.159
- Let me out!
- God!

22:08.328 --> 22:12.207
Can we just take a beat? Please.

22:24.303 --> 22:25.304
Please.

22:47.409 --> 22:49.203
Okay, my name's Mark.

22:50.579 --> 22:53.790
And-- So, I--

22:53.874 --> 22:56.376
You know, few years back,
I woke up on this table.

22:57.002 --> 22:58.045
In this room.

22:58.128 --> 23:03.884
And a disembodied voice
asked me 19 times who I was.

23:07.012 --> 23:09.223
And when I realized I couldn't answer,

23:09.306 --> 23:14.728
I told that voice that I would find him
and kill him.

23:16.647 --> 23:19.566
I don't know why I said that.
I mean, I was scared too.

23:20.817 --> 23:22.152
Did you kill the voice?

23:23.862 --> 23:24.863
No.

23:25.572 --> 23:30.118
No, that voice's name was Petey,
and he became my best friend.

23:32.204 --> 23:35.749
So, look, you know,
there is a life to be had here, Helly.

23:36.667 --> 23:38.293
A life to be had?

23:47.344 --> 23:53.809
Well, you see,
life, like a seesaw, requi--

23:56.562 --> 23:58.313
Let me the fuck out of here!

24:07.948 --> 24:10.826
- Ask me again.
- What?

24:10.909 --> 24:14.830
You've asked twice to be let go.
Ask one more time.

24:16.331 --> 24:17.875
- Mark.
- Yeah?

24:18.959 --> 24:21.253
I would like to leave the building now.

24:23.672 --> 24:26.675
I understand you don't feel
it's working out for you here at Lumon.

24:26.758 --> 24:30.345
While disappointed, I'd hate to
keep you somewhere you're not happy.

24:30.429 --> 24:33.390
So, let's get you outta here.

24:39.855 --> 24:40.856
Irv.

25:03.629 --> 25:07.424
The departments are pretty spaced out,
but it'll all fill in one day.

25:07.508 --> 25:09.218
They're planning an expansion.

25:10.052 --> 25:11.637
And I'm, what, part of that?

25:12.471 --> 25:14.431
No. You're a replacement.

25:15.224 --> 25:16.517
Replacement for who?

25:18.393 --> 25:20.103
Why are you saying that like you hate it?

25:27.319 --> 25:29.696
Here's your stairwell. Just past the bend.

25:36.995 --> 25:38.163
You're not coming with me?

25:38.247 --> 25:39.665
I'm not allowed to see.

25:39.748 --> 25:41.250
Excuse me?

25:41.333 --> 25:42.751
Well, once you leave, you--

25:44.503 --> 25:45.838
I just can't watch you leave.

25:53.011 --> 25:54.388
Of course you can't.

26:27.546 --> 26:29.590
What the hell?

27:21.892 --> 27:23.477
- Am I dead?
- No.

27:24.102 --> 27:26.480
- This isn't, like, hell or something?
- No.

27:27.648 --> 27:29.358
Then why the fuck can't I leave?

27:29.441 --> 27:32.236
Well, you did leave, just now.
Out into the stairwell at least.

27:32.319 --> 27:34.696
You left, but you came back.

27:35.781 --> 27:37.366
- I did not.
- You did.

27:38.325 --> 27:39.326
Come on.

27:42.746 --> 27:45.666
Weaponizing office equipment
on your first day.

27:46.834 --> 27:49.127
You are gonna be fun.

27:49.837 --> 27:51.672
Look, I do sympathize.

27:51.755 --> 27:56.760
I've wanted to pummel Mark myself,
but I am his employer.

27:56.844 --> 27:58.887
And he is your department chief.

27:59.680 --> 28:02.266
So we'll both have to be strong.

28:03.100 --> 28:07.104
The good news is, there's only
one part left of your orientation,

28:07.187 --> 28:10.315
which Mark can't possibly derail.

28:11.108 --> 28:12.359
Why is that?

28:12.943 --> 28:14.862
Because it's a video.

28:22.369 --> 28:24.538
Welcome to Lumon, Helly.

28:50.439 --> 28:51.732
Have a seat.

29:10.709 --> 29:12.085
Are you mad at me?

29:13.253 --> 29:17.633
For the incompetence or the disobedience?

29:18.842 --> 29:20.677
- Well--
- Yes!

29:22.471 --> 29:24.848
You know, my mother was an atheist.

29:25.807 --> 29:29.186
She used to say that there was
good news and bad news about hell.

29:29.770 --> 29:31.188
The good news is,

29:31.855 --> 29:36.693
hell is just the product
of a morbid human imagination.

29:36.777 --> 29:37.778
The bad news is,

29:39.363 --> 29:43.283
whatever humans can imagine,
they can usually create.

29:47.621 --> 29:49.164
I don't know what that means.

29:51.041 --> 29:54.628
A department like yours
can go so good or so bad.

29:55.379 --> 29:57.297
You know what makes the difference?

30:04.179 --> 30:05.180
The people.

30:16.692 --> 30:17.985
You can have a seat.

30:31.915 --> 30:34.543
Okay, go ahead and have a seat.

30:44.344 --> 30:45.429
My name is Helly R.

30:47.764 --> 30:48.932
I'm making this video

30:49.016 --> 30:53.187
roughly two hours
before it will be shown to me.

30:55.147 --> 30:58.483
I have, of my own free accord,
elected to undergo the procedure

30:58.567 --> 31:00.485
colloquially known as severance.

31:02.321 --> 31:07.409
I give consent for my perceptual
chronologies to be surgically split,

31:07.492 --> 31:11.663
separating my memories between
my work life and my personal life.

31:12.623 --> 31:13.957
I acknowledge that, henceforth,

31:14.041 --> 31:18.128
my access to my memories
will be spatially dictated.

31:19.421 --> 31:21.965
I will be unable to access
outside recollections

31:22.049 --> 31:24.968
whilst on Lumon's severed basement floor,

31:25.052 --> 31:27.513
nor retain work memories upon my ascent.

31:29.932 --> 31:33.185
I am aware that this alteration

31:33.268 --> 31:36.188
is comprehensive and irreversible.

31:37.773 --> 31:39.441
I make these statements freely.

31:44.780 --> 31:47.699
Okay, that's a wrap.

31:54.831 --> 31:55.832
Okay.

31:56.917 --> 31:57.918
Go ahead.

32:16.770 --> 32:18.272
So I'll never leave here?

32:20.524 --> 32:21.817
You'll leave at 5:00.

32:22.317 --> 32:25.487
Well, actually,
they stagger our exits, so 5:15.

32:26.697 --> 32:29.867
But it won't feel like it.
Not to this version of you anyway.

32:31.577 --> 32:32.911
Do I have a family?

32:33.954 --> 32:35.289
You'll never know.

32:36.874 --> 32:38.584
And I have no choice.

32:39.751 --> 32:45.007
Well, every time you find yourself here,
it's because you chose to come back.

33:13.076 --> 33:14.077
Hello.

33:52.199 --> 33:53.325
Good night.

33:53.408 --> 33:54.409
Good night.

34:43.458 --> 34:46.043
"Dear Mark,
Whilst carrying boxes in a room today,

34:46.128 --> 34:48.505
you slipped on an overhead projector slide

34:48.589 --> 34:52.176
and sustained a minor blow to the temple."

35:20.287 --> 35:21.496
Hey!

35:22.164 --> 35:23.749
Sorry.

35:25.125 --> 35:26.960
Maybe keep your eyes on the icy road.

35:29.838 --> 35:30.839
Sorry.

36:30.566 --> 36:34.570
Indeed, this gnat will spend
much of its three to seven-day life…

36:52.504 --> 36:56.925
No, I know, Mrs. Selvig.
It's just, it was in my space again.

36:57.759 --> 37:01.513
Yeah. Well, trash comes tomorrow night.
Tonight's recycling.

37:02.514 --> 37:05.642
Yeah, it is weird,
but that's how they do it.

37:05.726 --> 37:08.061
And with both yours, there's no room for--

37:25.746 --> 37:26.997
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:31.210 --> 37:32.211
Did you forget?

37:37.174 --> 37:38.759
Oh, yeah. Shit.

37:38.842 --> 37:39.843
That's okay.

37:40.844 --> 37:41.845
- Sorry.
- That's fine.

37:41.929 --> 37:44.640
- Do you wanna put on pants, and I'll…
- I'm wearing pants.

37:44.723 --> 37:46.517
…meet you in-- Those are not pants.

37:47.893 --> 37:51.730
So if there's no dinner, how is it dinner?

37:51.813 --> 37:52.940
- Okay.
- Like--

37:53.649 --> 37:55.317
You actually owe me this.

37:55.400 --> 37:56.944
- Do I?
- Yep.

37:57.027 --> 38:00.322
You remember that time when we were kids
and I was a way better sibling than you?

38:00.822 --> 38:02.866
Must have slipped my mind.

38:04.326 --> 38:06.745
Also,
I know we're nearing the anniversary,

38:06.828 --> 38:08.705
so I just thought
maybe you'd wanna be around people.

38:10.123 --> 38:11.124
Nope.

38:13.168 --> 38:15.462
This is nice. When did you get it?

38:15.546 --> 38:17.756
Something from work, and they apologized.

38:18.382 --> 38:19.800
They apologized. Thank God.

38:20.843 --> 38:22.761
Did they tack an explanation
onto that apology?

38:22.845 --> 38:25.180
It's fine. Got a gift card.

38:25.764 --> 38:28.475
You got a gift card. Where's he going to?

38:29.518 --> 38:30.644
I don't know. Pip's.

38:31.270 --> 38:34.147
Of course it's Pip's. Well, enjoy.

38:34.231 --> 38:36.024
I will, without you.

38:45.284 --> 38:46.743
There's our captive.

38:46.827 --> 38:49.246
- Hi, Rick.
- Ricken. Come on, it's Ricken.

38:50.497 --> 38:52.416
- You, sir, look at peace.
- You know.

38:53.125 --> 38:54.334
- Okay.
- Hi, baby.

38:54.418 --> 38:55.419
Hi.

38:56.170 --> 39:00.757
No, what a lot of people overlook,
I think, is that life is not food.

39:00.841 --> 39:02.551
- Right.
- You've got life,

39:02.634 --> 39:06.054
this complex quality
of sentience and activity.

39:06.138 --> 39:08.932
And then you've got food, which is what?

39:09.016 --> 39:10.392
- Yes, what is it?
- Fuel.

39:11.018 --> 39:13.353
Calories. It's not the same thing.

39:13.437 --> 39:15.814
- Yes, that is spot on, Patton.
- I definitely agree.

39:15.898 --> 39:17.566
Though, if I'm…

39:17.649 --> 39:22.863
Sorry, Mark and my dad used to have
"whiskey is life" carved on a flask.

39:24.448 --> 39:26.325
- True.
- It was low-hanging fruit.

39:26.408 --> 39:28.785
He did. He was a misdiagnosed alcoholic.

39:28.869 --> 39:32.247
Now, Mark, Ricken told Rebeck and me
that you're a former history professor.

39:32.331 --> 39:33.332
Yeah.

39:33.415 --> 39:35.792
So I'm curious
for your take on all of this.

39:37.211 --> 39:39.213
The food v life of it.

39:41.340 --> 39:44.885
Well, I'm not sure.
I taught mostly about World War I.

39:44.968 --> 39:47.095
Okay. Well, I got one for you.

39:47.179 --> 39:48.931
I was just reading this think piece

39:49.014 --> 39:52.768
about the comparative levels of violence
and warfare throughout history.

39:53.393 --> 39:54.394
Nerd alert.

39:54.478 --> 39:55.896
War porn, I know.

39:56.980 --> 40:02.444
But anyway, in it, he said that the people
actually called it the Great War.

40:03.028 --> 40:05.697
Apparently, it would have been a faux pas
to have called it World War I.

40:06.281 --> 40:07.616
Is that right?

40:11.411 --> 40:16.792
Well, you know,
no one would've called it World War I

40:16.875 --> 40:20.212
'cause World War II hadn't happened yet.

40:21.463 --> 40:23.090
- Wow.
- Of course.

40:23.173 --> 40:24.591
- That's absolutely right.
- Duh.

40:25.300 --> 40:26.343
That's so true.

40:26.426 --> 40:27.970
This is why we bring this guy.

40:28.929 --> 40:32.516
Mark's late wife, Gemma, was an educator
as well. Russian literature.

40:32.599 --> 40:34.518
- I love literature.
- Right?

40:35.519 --> 40:37.688
But Mark is a Lumon man now.

40:37.771 --> 40:39.106
- Ricken.
- Really?

40:39.189 --> 40:41.066
Yeah. About two years.

40:41.149 --> 40:43.110
- Do you design the medicines?
- No.

40:43.193 --> 40:45.863
I thought Lumon
was more on the tech side of things.

40:45.946 --> 40:47.739
- They began in the 1800s.
- Really?

40:47.823 --> 40:49.616
Topical salves, right?

40:49.700 --> 40:50.784
What don't they make?

40:51.743 --> 40:54.454
Yeah, but I'm in
the corporate archives division, so…

40:54.538 --> 40:56.790
So you know all the dirty secrets.

40:57.332 --> 40:59.126
- No, not really.
- No.

40:59.209 --> 41:03.338
Mark's work is sensitive enough
as to require the severance procedure.

41:07.843 --> 41:08.844
Well.

41:10.762 --> 41:12.264
That's something, isn't it?

41:14.016 --> 41:17.311
Yeah. It's also, I think, something
that's his choice to tell people or not.

41:17.394 --> 41:18.854
- Right, Ricken?
- Oh, my God.

41:18.937 --> 41:20.814
- No. No.
- Oh, God, Mark.

41:20.898 --> 41:22.566
- Please forgive me.
- No. It's okay. I don't care.

41:22.649 --> 41:25.694
- My apologies.
- No, I think it's fascinating.

41:25.777 --> 41:27.446
I mean, I wish I could do it.

41:28.530 --> 41:31.909
I'd just always be thinking about,
you know, the other one.

41:34.786 --> 41:37.748
Well, there is no other one.

41:38.624 --> 41:40.709
It's me. I do the job.

41:40.792 --> 41:44.922
I just don't grasp the visceral element.
What does it feel like?

41:48.175 --> 41:51.553
Well, it's simple.
One's memories are bifurcated,

41:51.637 --> 41:54.973
so when you're not at work, you have no
recollection of what it is you do there.

41:55.057 --> 41:56.058
Did I get that right, Mark?

41:56.141 --> 41:58.936
- Well, it's--
- So you walk in at 9:00 a.m.,

41:59.019 --> 42:01.605
and then suddenly it's 5:00,
and you're leaving?

42:01.688 --> 42:04.233
- Well, they stagger us a little, so--
- They stagger you?

42:04.316 --> 42:07.569
And then, conversely, when you're at work,
you can't access outside memories.

42:07.653 --> 42:11.323
So, in effect,
that version of you is trapped there.

42:11.406 --> 42:13.575
Well…

42:13.659 --> 42:16.203
- Well, I mean, not trapped, but--
- But what?

42:20.290 --> 42:24.253
No, no. I'm curious. What were you
gonna say? But not trapped, but what?

42:27.130 --> 42:28.131
What were you saying?

42:32.261 --> 42:35.055
So I suppose we know where you fall
on the congressional goings-on.

42:35.138 --> 42:36.431
Okay, I think we may be

42:36.515 --> 42:37.641
- missing the point here.
- Yeah.

42:39.309 --> 42:41.979
The point is that Mark made a decision.

42:42.062 --> 42:43.814
And that decision was controversial,

42:45.190 --> 42:47.150
ethically and socially.

42:47.734 --> 42:50.487
Morally. Scientifically.

42:51.530 --> 42:54.950
But, Mark, I stand behind you

42:55.576 --> 42:56.785
without reservation.

42:56.869 --> 42:58.495
- So well said.
- Thank you.

42:58.579 --> 43:00.998
- Absolutely.
- I definitely stand behind Mark.

43:02.124 --> 43:03.125
Wow.

43:04.751 --> 43:07.087
Thank you. That's very sweet.

43:07.963 --> 43:10.382
Well, we're at the point
where, traditionally,

43:10.465 --> 43:12.509
I would say something like, "Dig in."

43:13.886 --> 43:16.471
But I must say,
I do think that the lack of food

43:16.555 --> 43:21.101
has allowed us to already do so
on a much deeper level.

43:21.185 --> 43:23.020
- Oh, yeah. No, absolutely.
- Right?

43:23.103 --> 43:25.981
I was saying, my friend in Lima
hasn't had a food-based dinner event in--

43:27.608 --> 43:30.277
If I give you $3,000, will you forgive me?

43:31.570 --> 43:36.491
Well, because your child
is innocent of tonight's atrocities,

43:36.575 --> 43:40.037
I'll wait until after it's born
to murder you.

43:40.120 --> 43:43.540
Oh, my God. Here you go, buddy.

43:46.585 --> 43:47.586
Thank you.

43:52.508 --> 43:56.595
Hey, how's the good doctor therapy man
with that weird little mustache?

44:01.517 --> 44:02.518
You're not going?

44:04.353 --> 44:06.813
Well, the work thing's helped.

44:08.148 --> 44:09.149
Yeah.

44:10.734 --> 44:13.529
I'm proud of you for taking that job.
I really am.

44:14.738 --> 44:17.032
And I think she would've been too.
I know she would've been.

44:20.327 --> 44:23.872
I just feel like forgetting about her
for eight hours a day

44:23.956 --> 44:26.792
isn't the same thing as healing.

44:34.842 --> 44:36.677
You wanna crash here,
since you're already here?

44:38.178 --> 44:39.179
No.

44:40.347 --> 44:41.348
Why?

44:41.431 --> 44:43.267
Your house smells like pregnancy.

44:47.062 --> 44:49.273
Yeah, I'm just not grasping
the visceral element of it.

44:51.108 --> 44:52.526
She is fun, wasn't she?

44:53.110 --> 44:55.904
- You're definitely staying here tonight.
- No, I'm not.

44:55.988 --> 44:57.906
I'm making all the bedsheets myself,

44:57.990 --> 45:01.034
so I won't finish with the big one
for some time.

45:01.785 --> 45:04.288
But the twin is comfortable,

45:04.371 --> 45:07.124
and the pajamas were made
on a Baltic handloom,

45:07.207 --> 45:09.585
so you'll sleep well.

45:10.127 --> 45:14.256
Thanks.
I still don't quite get the three beds.

45:14.339 --> 45:16.341
- Right.
- Ricken's colleague told us

45:16.425 --> 45:20.262
that switching out the beds
as the child grows can wound that child.

45:20.345 --> 45:21.722
Irreparably.

45:21.805 --> 45:26.018
But if you provide said child
with all of its beds upon birth,

45:26.101 --> 45:29.146
you allow it to progress across the room
at its own rate.

45:29.771 --> 45:31.356
Got it. Yeah.

45:36.486 --> 45:37.487
Yeah.

45:38.572 --> 45:40.574
I think people really enjoyed you tonight,
Mark.

45:42.826 --> 45:43.827
Good.

45:44.328 --> 45:45.537
All right, baby.

45:46.663 --> 45:47.748
- You ready, baby?
- Yeah.

45:47.831 --> 45:48.916
- Let's go.
- Sweet dreams.

45:48.999 --> 45:50.000
Thanks.

45:51.543 --> 45:53.045
Good night, milord.

45:53.128 --> 45:54.546
Good night, milady.

47:51.955 --> 47:52.956
Hey.

47:53.457 --> 47:54.458
Hey.

47:54.958 --> 47:55.959
How long you been up?

47:56.543 --> 47:57.669
A while.

48:00.923 --> 48:04.468
There was a businessman
in the yard last night.

48:04.551 --> 48:06.220
- A businessman?
- Yeah.

48:06.303 --> 48:08.222
Entry-level or management?

48:08.305 --> 48:09.306
I'm serious.

48:09.890 --> 48:11.600
There was seriously a man
in my yard last night?

48:11.683 --> 48:12.935
Yeah.

48:13.519 --> 48:14.520
Holy shit.

48:15.646 --> 48:18.482
He, you know, looked at me weird,
like he knew me.

48:19.024 --> 48:21.610
Did the prowler invading my home
make you feel seen?

48:21.693 --> 48:22.945
So seen.

48:24.488 --> 48:27.282
Well, there's a bar down the hill.
It's probably just a stumbler.

48:28.200 --> 48:30.911
Speaking of which,
you still smell like a distillery.

48:31.870 --> 48:35.332
I'm sorry,
I just had to drown out the memory

48:35.415 --> 48:38.627
of Mom and Dad switching out my beds
when we were kids.

48:39.211 --> 48:41.004
You've been sitting on that one.

49:32.514 --> 49:33.515
Hello.

49:35.058 --> 49:40.022
Okay.
So, recycling was last night, Mrs. Selvig.

49:40.105 --> 49:41.398
Tonight's garbage.

49:41.481 --> 49:45.152
And you keep putting your bin on my side.
So--

49:47.154 --> 49:48.655
Yeah. Okay.

49:49.907 --> 49:53.202
You know, I actually can't talk right now.
I'm out at dinner. But--

49:54.786 --> 49:56.288
No, by myself.

49:59.041 --> 50:01.502
Pip's Bar and Grille.

50:02.544 --> 50:03.629
Excuse me.

50:05.214 --> 50:07.424
Hang up. Quickly.

50:12.513 --> 50:15.724
I'm sorry, Mrs. Selvig.
They've cooked the food, and it's here.

50:18.018 --> 50:20.938
Hi, kids. What's for dinner?

50:26.026 --> 50:28.820
I'm sorry. You don't get that reference.

50:31.240 --> 50:33.700
Are you following me?

50:34.701 --> 50:36.245
Your voice is different here.

50:37.204 --> 50:38.288
Worse.

50:40.374 --> 50:42.918
- Okay, who the fuck are you?
- Petey.

50:43.001 --> 50:45.337
My name is Petey. I'm from work.

50:47.631 --> 50:51.510
Well, that's not plausible.
Everyone in my department is--

50:51.593 --> 50:54.513
Severed. Severed. I was.

50:56.390 --> 50:58.559
Okay. Well, severance is pretty permanent.

50:58.642 --> 51:02.312
Yeah. Bypassing the implant wasn't easy.
I had help.

51:15.450 --> 51:18.120
So, what, you were unhappy at work?

51:18.203 --> 51:20.789
- And instead of lodging a complaint, you--
- No.

51:21.498 --> 51:24.585
I tried that first. So did you.

51:26.420 --> 51:29.506
Right. Okay. So…

51:30.966 --> 51:32.426
You've unsevered.

51:32.509 --> 51:37.306
And now you, what, think they're
after you or something?

51:41.101 --> 51:42.102
Yeah.

51:45.439 --> 51:49.610
"They" being Graner,
who's probably out here right now.

51:49.693 --> 51:54.323
Graner. Okay.
Is that, like, a person you know or…

51:54.406 --> 51:57.701
We both know him. We don't like him.

51:59.286 --> 52:00.287
I see.

52:06.210 --> 52:10.506
Nothing down there is what they say.

52:12.049 --> 52:13.759
If something happens to me,

52:14.718 --> 52:18.180
the things I know need to stay known.

52:20.682 --> 52:22.559
I'd prefer it be by a friend.

52:28.190 --> 52:30.692
So, we're friends?

52:32.194 --> 52:33.570
I'm your best friend.

52:35.239 --> 52:36.740
You're my very good friend.

53:12.109 --> 53:14.820
Mark, sorry about the card.

53:15.863 --> 53:18.198
I had to grab something,
and I know it's not appropriate.

53:18.282 --> 53:21.493
Though I'm sure you'd be
a really fucking awesome niece.

53:23.745 --> 53:27.291
We used to wonder
what kind of men we were on the outside,

53:27.916 --> 53:30.627
what choices we had made and why.

53:37.384 --> 53:39.344
I used to think it would take a monster

53:39.428 --> 53:41.805
to put someone
in a place like that office.

53:43.599 --> 53:46.143
Especially if the person was himself.

53:49.146 --> 53:52.941
But we're not monsters, Mark.
Not real ones.

53:55.694 --> 53:59.740
If you don't wanna know what's
going on down there, I won't force it.

54:02.326 --> 54:06.330
But if you do, there's an address
on the back of this card.

54:08.332 --> 54:13.128
Go alone, and you'll find
the beginning of a very long answer.

54:34.733 --> 54:37.069
Mark, is that you?

54:37.152 --> 54:38.445
Hi, Mrs. Selvig.

54:39.905 --> 54:44.201
Will you color me embarrassed
for the mix-up with the bins?

54:44.284 --> 54:45.577
No, it's no problem.

54:46.787 --> 54:47.788
How was dinner?

54:48.789 --> 54:51.750
Fine. I'm just, you know, tired.

54:53.460 --> 54:56.004
You know, my mother was a Catholic.

54:56.088 --> 55:01.802
She used to say it takes the saints
eight hours to bless a sleeping child.

55:02.678 --> 55:05.055
I hope you aren't rushing the saints.

55:06.139 --> 55:09.560
Well, I'll give them ample time tonight.

55:11.144 --> 55:12.646
Good night, Mrs. Selvig.

55:12.729 --> 55:13.730
Mark.

55:16.900 --> 55:18.610
You're good people.
