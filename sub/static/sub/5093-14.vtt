00:20.901 --> 00:22.869
My father's been
asking for you.

00:22.871 --> 00:24.537
How's he doing, Levi?

00:24.539 --> 00:25.788
It won't be long.

00:25.790 --> 00:27.874
I'm sorry.

00:27.876 --> 00:30.793
You remember my
brother Jacob.

00:30.795 --> 00:31.794
Commissioner.

00:31.796 --> 00:33.996
Jacob.

00:45.809 --> 00:49.128
Leave us. Leave us.

00:53.350 --> 00:56.185
Somebody call the police?

00:58.990 --> 01:02.775
How long we been
friends, Henry?

01:02.777 --> 01:05.828
Over 30 years.

01:05.830 --> 01:10.366
Never met a man
I trusted more.

01:10.368 --> 01:11.918
Hmm.

01:11.920 --> 01:13.703
And a goy, no less.

01:15.707 --> 01:17.423
The feeling is mutual.

01:18.709 --> 01:20.343
Anything I can do?

01:20.345 --> 01:23.963
My final act...

01:23.965 --> 01:26.349
as Grand Rebbe...

01:26.351 --> 01:28.801
is to choose my successor.

01:28.803 --> 01:31.521
I have two sons.

01:33.056 --> 01:38.110
Jacob is older and
by tradition...

01:38.112 --> 01:42.014
would succeed me,

01:42.016 --> 01:45.868
but I know, in my heart,

01:45.870 --> 01:49.155
Levi is the true leader.

01:49.157 --> 01:52.074
Oh, Solly,
that's a tough call.

01:52.076 --> 01:56.879
I'm praying for wisdom.

01:56.881 --> 01:59.531
In the end I suppose

01:59.533 --> 02:03.002
all a father can
give his sons

02:03.004 --> 02:05.304
is the truth.

02:24.524 --> 02:26.576
Smell that?

02:26.578 --> 02:27.827
Smells like the good stuff.

02:27.829 --> 02:30.062
Yeah.
Brings back memories, huh?

02:30.064 --> 02:31.497
Only thing I remember
about that stuff

02:31.499 --> 02:33.732
was jamming a bunch
of pizza in my face.

02:33.734 --> 02:35.751
No, you...

02:38.589 --> 02:41.290
You think they see us?

02:41.292 --> 02:42.508
Yeah, I think so.

02:42.510 --> 02:44.176
I think they're just
too stoned to care.

02:46.263 --> 02:48.580
It's a good one.

02:48.582 --> 02:49.932
Mm-hmm.

02:49.934 --> 02:52.084
Got it
from Billy's guy.

02:59.610 --> 03:01.727
Oh, God, Rebecca, cops.

03:03.064 --> 03:05.531
Relax, they don't bust people
for smoking pot anymore.

03:05.533 --> 03:07.333
Actually we do.

03:07.335 --> 03:09.535
Uh, can we see
some I.D., please?

03:10.787 --> 03:11.787
You gonna put that out?

03:14.708 --> 03:16.542
We're really sorry, Officer.

03:16.544 --> 03:18.878
Don't have a stroke,
Bridge, it's cool.

03:18.880 --> 03:20.162
Not really.

03:22.883 --> 03:25.134
You mind opening your bag?

03:25.136 --> 03:28.287
Oh.

03:29.622 --> 03:31.807
Some big green buds.

03:32.759 --> 03:34.477
Must have set you back
a few bucks, huh?

03:34.479 --> 03:36.896
Don't you guys have
any real criminals to chase?

03:36.898 --> 03:38.898
Might want to ease up
on the attitude, Rebecca.

03:38.900 --> 03:40.683
You don't know who my father is.

03:41.685 --> 03:43.969
I don't really care.

03:43.971 --> 03:47.156
Seriously, my parents
will kill me if I get arrested.

03:47.158 --> 03:48.307
Trust me,

03:48.309 --> 03:51.360
these clowns are not
going to arrest us.

03:51.362 --> 03:54.580
Well, not till you said that.

03:54.582 --> 03:56.666
Do me a favor--
get up,

03:56.668 --> 03:59.651
face the fence, please.

03:59.653 --> 04:01.587
Put your hands
behind your back.

04:01.589 --> 04:02.988
Thanks a lot, Rebecca.

04:02.990 --> 04:04.507
You're going
to regret this.

04:04.509 --> 04:06.125
You're going to regret
ever meeting me.

04:06.127 --> 04:08.160
Oh, I already do.

04:31.818 --> 04:33.903
Your father was
a great man, Levi.

04:33.905 --> 04:36.322
I only hope I can live up
to his leadership.

04:36.324 --> 04:39.825
As I told my son
when he took over for me,

04:39.827 --> 04:43.412
take what you can,
then make the job your own.

05:08.155 --> 05:11.157
Yes... I got your messages.

05:11.159 --> 05:12.825
The community is grieving.

05:12.827 --> 05:14.160
It's my job to comfort them.

05:14.162 --> 05:15.945
Everything else has to wait!

05:33.714 --> 05:35.881
Levi!

05:35.883 --> 05:37.016
Come through here.

05:38.936 --> 05:41.086
Levi!

05:43.857 --> 05:45.107
No...

05:53.117 --> 05:54.817
It's just us here.

05:56.787 --> 05:59.071
Oh, my God.

When you coming home?

Francis...

06:37.832 --> 06:39.998
Levi Morgenthal
was stabbed to death

06:40.000 --> 06:42.184
outside his father's funeral.

06:43.686 --> 06:45.270
Anyone in custody?

06:45.272 --> 06:46.254
Not yet.

06:46.256 --> 06:47.756
Want me to come down there?

06:47.758 --> 06:49.942
No, no, I just thought
you should know first.

06:49.944 --> 06:50.893
Oh, hey, I've got to go.

06:50.895 --> 06:51.894
The detectives are here.

06:51.896 --> 06:53.612
Don't wait up.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.233
Sorry to get
you out of bed.

06:58.235 --> 07:00.101
No, are you kidding me?
It's nothing.

07:00.103 --> 07:02.788
Um, I know you were friends
with the victim's father.

07:02.790 --> 07:04.039
Yeah.
I'm sorry.

07:04.041 --> 07:06.124
Um, did you tell the old man
I was coming down,

07:06.126 --> 07:07.159
and that you called me?

07:07.161 --> 07:08.243
He's the commissioner.

07:08.245 --> 07:10.612
He knows everything that
goes on in this city.

07:10.614 --> 07:11.630
Right, well,
unfortunately,

07:11.632 --> 07:12.798
you're not
the commissioner anymore,

07:12.800 --> 07:14.383
so I'm gonna have
to ask you to wait out here.

07:14.385 --> 07:16.718
Okay?
I know, I know.

07:16.720 --> 07:19.087
Police only.
Yeah.

07:19.089 --> 07:21.289
They come up
with anything on canvass?

07:21.291 --> 07:23.175
No, not yet.
Who are you?

07:23.177 --> 07:25.811
I'm Detective Wolf Landsman.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.312
The Chief of D's,
I think, told you

07:27.314 --> 07:28.488
that I was gonna
come down here.

07:28.513 --> 07:29.465
Oh, right.

07:29.466 --> 07:31.132
You grew up around
here or something?

07:31.134 --> 07:32.818
I'm third generation Hasidic.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.486
Really. Hasidic.

07:34.488 --> 07:37.356
Where's your beard and
your, uh, ponytail things?

07:37.358 --> 07:38.490
Those are called payots.
Payots.

07:38.492 --> 07:39.975
And I left them behind
17 years ago

07:39.977 --> 07:40.976
when I left the community.

07:40.978 --> 07:43.278
Ah.
But I still know my way around here.

07:43.280 --> 07:45.030
Well, I hope so, because
it's not always easy

07:45.032 --> 07:46.915
to get cooperation
around here, you know?

07:46.917 --> 07:50.652
The Hasidim are
very suspicious of outsiders.

07:50.654 --> 07:52.988
Yeah, I know.

07:52.990 --> 07:55.123
Back in Europe,
men in uniform tried

07:55.125 --> 07:56.992
to wipe them off
the face of the earth.

07:56.994 --> 07:58.844
Yeah, I know
about that, too.

07:58.846 --> 08:02.114
The Grand Rebbe controls
the largest sect.

08:02.116 --> 08:04.216
They have their own world
and their own rules.

08:04.218 --> 08:06.835
Rule number one:
outsiders are not welcome.

08:06.837 --> 08:08.003
Well, look, I'm not trying

08:08.005 --> 08:09.104
to disrespect anyone's
religion, okay?

08:09.106 --> 08:10.439
But I got my own rules,

08:10.441 --> 08:12.474
and my rule number one is:
no one gets away with murder.

08:12.476 --> 08:14.059
Okay?
I'm only here to help.

08:14.061 --> 08:15.394
All right,
this is the widow.

08:15.396 --> 08:19.231
I'm Detective Reagan,
this is Detective Landsman.

08:19.233 --> 08:21.033
We're very sorry
for your loss.

08:21.035 --> 08:22.517
Thank you.

08:22.519 --> 08:23.569
And who are
you, sir?

08:23.571 --> 08:26.455
Uh, I was Levi's gabbai--

08:26.457 --> 08:27.706
Asher Lefko.

08:27.708 --> 08:30.325
That's his closest advisor.

08:30.327 --> 08:31.877
Were you in the temple
tonight, ma'am?

08:31.879 --> 08:35.330
No. I was at home.

08:36.198 --> 08:38.250
Levi called me right before.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.868
What did you two talk about?

08:41.688 --> 08:44.139
He was upset about his father,

08:44.140 --> 08:46.374
doing his best
to comfort everyone.

08:46.376 --> 08:48.594
Do you have any idea
who would have wanted

08:48.596 --> 08:50.095
to do this to your
husband, ma'am?

08:50.097 --> 08:53.482
Only a godless animal
could do s-such a thing.

08:55.068 --> 08:58.437
Well, look, if you think of
anything that might help us,

08:58.439 --> 09:01.406
would you call, please?

09:01.408 --> 09:02.390
It's my number on the...

09:02.392 --> 09:03.725
She won't take it--
give it to him.

09:03.727 --> 09:05.560
Thank you.
All right.

09:05.562 --> 09:07.613
This officer will escort
you out, all right?

09:10.066 --> 09:12.067
Standing room only in
that temple tonight.

09:12.069 --> 09:13.234
Somebody saw something.

09:13.236 --> 09:15.587
But the trick now
is getting them to step up.

09:15.589 --> 09:18.790
Well, hopefully, that's
where you come in.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.592
Well, this should be fun.

09:20.594 --> 09:22.327
Yeah.

09:22.329 --> 09:26.598
Thank God Solomon Morgenthal
didn't live to see this.

09:26.600 --> 09:27.766
He even told me how difficult

09:27.768 --> 09:29.417
it was going to be
for the community

09:29.419 --> 09:32.804
to accept Levi
as the new rebbe.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.806
Talk about an understatement.

09:34.808 --> 09:37.192
Yeah.

09:37.194 --> 09:39.027
What I would like
to know, Pop,

09:39.029 --> 09:41.363
is how did Danny happen
to catch this case?

09:41.365 --> 09:44.783
I thought I told
you not to wait up.

09:44.785 --> 09:45.984
How'd you know about that?

09:45.986 --> 09:46.985
I'm the police commissioner.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.787
I know everything
that happens in this city.

09:48.789 --> 09:51.106
Yeah, okay, I called him.

09:51.108 --> 09:54.275
Solomon wanted
us to help Levi.

09:54.277 --> 09:56.444
The least we could do is
find out who killed him.

09:56.446 --> 09:59.948
Former police commissioner,
me, Danny--

09:59.950 --> 10:01.967
it looks like
special privilege, Pop.

10:01.969 --> 10:05.137
My friend and my
friend's son are dead.

10:07.590 --> 10:10.676
Okay.

10:10.678 --> 10:12.844
I understand.

10:14.296 --> 10:17.015
Okay.

10:20.820 --> 10:22.804
It's got to be hard
on Jacob--

10:22.806 --> 10:25.941
losing a father
and a brother the same day.

10:25.943 --> 10:27.859
Yeah.

10:27.861 --> 10:30.145
Solomon hated choosing
between them.

10:30.147 --> 10:31.580
What father wouldn't?

10:31.582 --> 10:32.864
I suppose.

10:32.866 --> 10:36.001
Why'd you and mom never have
any more kids, anyway?

10:36.003 --> 10:37.869
What?

10:37.871 --> 10:41.923
Well... Irish Catholic family,
mid-1950s?

10:41.925 --> 10:43.508
Come on, Pop.

10:45.828 --> 10:47.996
Did you ever ask your
mother about that?

10:47.998 --> 10:51.550
Well, matter of fact, I did;
couple of times.

10:51.552 --> 10:53.051
And what did she tell you?

10:53.053 --> 10:55.520
She always said
the same thing:

10:55.522 --> 10:57.689
"Mind your own business."

10:58.524 --> 11:01.059
Sounds like pretty
good advice to me.

11:07.316 --> 11:09.735
<i>Glad you could join us,</i>
<i>partner.</i>

11:09.737 --> 11:11.686
Sorry I'm late.
I basically had to show my piece

11:11.688 --> 11:12.821
to get in this place.

11:12.823 --> 11:14.823
Women are rarely allowed
in synagogue.

11:14.825 --> 11:17.909
Unless it's a woman who's a
New York City police detective.

11:17.911 --> 11:20.695
Detective McElroy,
Detective Landsman.

11:22.715 --> 11:24.416
Okay, well, now
that the gang's all here,

11:24.418 --> 11:25.417
who are these guys?

11:25.419 --> 11:26.585
<i>Shomrim.</i>

11:26.587 --> 11:27.719
They're protecting
the new Grand Rebbe.

11:27.721 --> 11:28.870
Some of them are

11:28.872 --> 11:31.539
real animals.
Don't push them too hard.

11:31.541 --> 11:34.142
Well, we got to do
what we got to do, right?

11:34.144 --> 11:36.895
We're in a holy temple,
and the rabbi is in mourning.

11:36.897 --> 11:39.380
Okay, so I'll play nice.

11:40.016 --> 11:41.516
You are not to be here.

11:41.518 --> 11:43.384
Excuse me?
With all due respect,

11:43.386 --> 11:45.237
we need to speak with the rabbi.

11:45.239 --> 11:47.072
I know you.

11:47.074 --> 11:49.057
You abandoned your people.

11:49.059 --> 11:51.493
You're as much an outsider
as they are.

11:51.495 --> 11:53.111
It's all right, Benny.

11:57.200 --> 11:59.400
You are the grandson
of Henry Reagan?

11:59.402 --> 12:00.836
That's right, Rabbi.

12:00.838 --> 12:02.370
He's been a great friend to us.

12:02.372 --> 12:04.239
How may I help you?

12:04.241 --> 12:07.759
Well, we're here to investigate
the murder of your brother.

12:07.761 --> 12:09.377
We have some questions.
It'll be helpful

12:09.379 --> 12:10.762
if you could
answer them.

12:10.764 --> 12:12.464
Did Levi have any enemies?

12:12.466 --> 12:17.185
None of our people would commit
such an atrocity against God.

12:17.187 --> 12:19.271
We're not making
any accusations.

12:20.106 --> 12:21.139
Although your father

12:21.141 --> 12:22.808
did choose your younger brother

12:22.810 --> 12:24.893
to be his replacement,
instead of you.

12:24.895 --> 12:26.761
Must've been a little awkward
for you, right?

12:26.763 --> 12:29.114
My father was a wise man,
Mm-hmm.

12:29.116 --> 12:32.200
and he made the choice
that he felt was right.

12:32.202 --> 12:33.735
And I didn't question it.

12:33.737 --> 12:36.071
And if you are asking me

12:36.073 --> 12:37.823
if I had my brother killed

12:37.825 --> 12:40.441
so that I could take his place,

12:40.443 --> 12:42.610
then the answer is no.

12:42.612 --> 12:46.832
I'd have sooner taken
my own life than harm Levi.

12:47.884 --> 12:49.284
Uh, he meant no disrespect.

12:49.286 --> 12:51.303
Well, then we have very
different definitions

12:51.305 --> 12:52.504
of that word.

12:53.622 --> 12:56.842
Now, if you will excuse me.

12:56.844 --> 13:01.096
I have to prayor the souls
of my family.

13:02.265 --> 13:04.299
That's your idea of going easy?

13:04.301 --> 13:07.319
Hey, this may be your world,
but it's our case.

13:07.321 --> 13:11.189
I'm gonna do what I got to
do to solve it, <i>capiche?</i>

13:11.191 --> 13:14.309
It's working
like a charm so far.

13:14.311 --> 13:16.328
<i>I'm not telling you how</i>
<i>to run the case, Danny, but...</i>

13:16.330 --> 13:17.913
if you push these people,

13:17.915 --> 13:19.781
they're gonna shut down.
Well, I'll be sure to use

13:19.783 --> 13:21.963
plenty of pleases
and thank yous, okay?

13:21.988 --> 13:22.668
Hey, guys,

13:22.669 --> 13:25.820
we got surveillance tape
from the rear of the synagogue.

13:25.822 --> 13:30.158
This is Levi leaving
his father's funeral.

13:30.160 --> 13:31.343
And check this out.

13:39.101 --> 13:42.137
That's that side of beef
from the, uh, synagogue.

13:42.139 --> 13:44.306
Benny Roth,
Jacob's main bodyguard.

13:44.308 --> 13:46.808
Roth left 53 seconds after Levi.

13:46.810 --> 13:49.010
Just in time for Levi
to get dead.

13:49.012 --> 13:51.279
This guy, he's always
by Jacob's side, right?

13:51.281 --> 13:52.948
Most of the time.

13:52.950 --> 13:55.200
I'll check
with my confidential informant.

13:55.202 --> 13:58.286
Knows everyone's business--
who's doing what to who and why.

13:58.288 --> 14:00.238
Yeah, sounds
like a real piece of work.

14:01.123 --> 14:03.208
Do I insult your mother?

14:04.210 --> 14:06.194
You're kidding, right?

14:06.196 --> 14:09.197
If there's one thing
a Jewish boy never kids about...

14:16.138 --> 14:17.973
Commissioner,
Robert Levitt.

14:17.975 --> 14:19.374
Thank you.
Mr. Mayor.

14:19.376 --> 14:22.093
Not anymore, thank God.

14:22.095 --> 14:23.762
I really appreciate
you seeing me, Frank.

14:23.764 --> 14:24.646
Sure.

14:24.648 --> 14:25.897
And how are you, Garrett?

14:25.899 --> 14:26.748
Sir.

14:26.750 --> 14:28.683
So...

14:28.685 --> 14:31.219
I mean, the place
looks the same and...

14:31.221 --> 14:33.888
I'm not big
on redecorating.

14:33.890 --> 14:36.992
Please.
Oh, thank you.

14:39.728 --> 14:40.728
So...

14:40.730 --> 14:43.081
how are things at Ellison, Cohn?

14:43.083 --> 14:46.567
Uh, I go in a couple of days
a week, make some calls.

14:46.569 --> 14:48.670
Let's face it, uh,
they're paying me a ton of money

14:48.672 --> 14:50.238
to put my name
on the letterhead.

14:50.240 --> 14:52.374
Anytime you want
to switch jobs...

14:52.376 --> 14:53.458
I'll take a piece of that.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.243
You guys would die of boredom
the first week.

14:55.245 --> 14:57.012
So, how are you doing
with the new guy?

14:57.014 --> 15:00.932
Makes me appreciate the way
you handled the job.

15:00.934 --> 15:02.083
That bad, huh?

15:03.269 --> 15:06.087
I kind of wish I hadn't
given you such a hard time.

15:06.089 --> 15:07.755
But it was just so damn fun.

15:10.726 --> 15:12.644
I have also...

15:12.646 --> 15:16.431
come to understand
how tough it is being mayor.

15:16.433 --> 15:19.267
Well, we did go at it, but, uh,

15:19.269 --> 15:21.786
I always respected
the job you did.

15:21.788 --> 15:25.240
Likewise.

15:25.242 --> 15:27.942
Good.

15:31.747 --> 15:35.116
Well, I've got
that press, uh, thing.

15:35.118 --> 15:36.634
Hey.
Good to see you, Mayor.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.837
Thank you.

15:44.143 --> 15:46.344
So...

15:49.965 --> 15:53.601
I got a problem, and I'm hoping
you can help me with it.

15:53.603 --> 15:56.488
Of course.

15:56.490 --> 15:58.806
My daughter, uh, Rebecca,

15:58.808 --> 16:01.609
she got herself
in-into some trouble--

16:01.611 --> 16:03.611
smoking marijuana in the park.

16:03.613 --> 16:06.531
Sorry to hear that.

16:06.533 --> 16:08.583
She's a really good kid,

16:08.585 --> 16:10.502
a little headstrong
maybe, but...

16:10.504 --> 16:12.787
she's really got
a heart of gold.

16:12.789 --> 16:14.039
She made a mistake,

16:14.041 --> 16:16.091
but it's been blown
way out of proportion.

16:16.093 --> 16:19.677
And, uh... I mean,
her mother is, uh,

16:19.679 --> 16:23.164
about to burst herself
into flames; it just...

16:23.166 --> 16:25.333
I'm sorry to hear that also.

16:26.635 --> 16:29.337
I was hoping you'd talk
to the arresting officer.

16:31.840 --> 16:35.643
That would be such a break
in the chain of command.

16:35.645 --> 16:37.362
Not in this case.

16:37.364 --> 16:39.531
The officer's your son Jamie.

16:47.590 --> 16:49.624
<i>So, Wolf, how is it</i>

16:49.626 --> 16:50.992
that your mom knows
that Benny Roth

16:50.994 --> 16:52.660
is gonna be
at the sauna tonight?

16:52.662 --> 16:54.946
Hasidim are creatures of habit.
And it's called a <i>schvitz.</i>

16:54.948 --> 16:58.032
A bunch of fat, naked guys
sweating together? Good times.

16:58.034 --> 17:00.251
The Talmud frowns on hot,
naked women sweating together.

17:00.253 --> 17:03.638
Is that why you left the Hasids?
Can you think of a better reason?

17:03.640 --> 17:04.806
Police.

17:04.808 --> 17:06.257
We need to speak
to Benny Roth.

17:06.259 --> 17:08.893
No goyim allowed. You want
to come in, get a warrant.

17:08.895 --> 17:10.395
Look, I ain't a goy.

17:10.396 --> 17:11.563
You ain't a Hasid either.

17:11.565 --> 17:13.815
Okay, how about this?
If we got to get back

17:13.817 --> 17:16.384
in our car and and leave,
then the next shield you see

17:16.386 --> 17:17.935
is gonna belong to
the health department,

17:17.938 --> 17:20.655
okay?
Fine. You two.

17:20.656 --> 17:22.323
The shiksa stays out here.

17:22.325 --> 17:24.159
You got to be kidding.

17:24.161 --> 17:26.560
Bunch of fat,
sweaty guys, right?

17:26.563 --> 17:27.945
Yeah.

17:27.948 --> 17:29.364
I'll be right here.

17:30.232 --> 17:32.733
With this guy.

17:40.793 --> 17:43.711
Benny, no need to get up.
Got a few questions for you.

17:43.713 --> 17:46.598
I got nothing to say to you.

17:46.600 --> 17:49.417
We got you on tape
following Levi

17:49.419 --> 17:51.219
out of the shul
the night he died.

17:51.221 --> 17:52.470
Since when is that a crime?

17:52.472 --> 17:55.140
Well, since the guy
that you muscle for-- Jacob--

17:55.142 --> 17:56.524
got the job of his
dreams when you

17:56.526 --> 17:58.059
took out his kid brother Levi.

17:58.061 --> 18:00.945
You cops are all the same--

18:00.947 --> 18:02.597
stupid and lazy.

18:02.599 --> 18:03.565
Yeah.

18:03.567 --> 18:04.932
Put it on.

18:04.934 --> 18:06.568
You're coming down
to the precinct.

18:06.570 --> 18:08.620
Yeah?

18:08.622 --> 18:11.156
Who's going to make me?

18:12.408 --> 18:13.658
You?

18:16.078 --> 18:17.629
You?

18:18.547 --> 18:21.749
A coward who spits
on everything he is?

18:28.090 --> 18:31.125
If you were twice as smart,
you'd still be a moron.

18:31.127 --> 18:33.461
You know, uh,
not for nothing,

18:33.463 --> 18:35.263
but what happened
to going easy?

18:35.265 --> 18:37.315
Your way's more fun.

18:37.317 --> 18:39.434
Oh. That's true.

18:56.027 --> 18:58.395
We're getting calls
on the Morgenthal case.

18:58.397 --> 19:00.564
Let me guess:
"Did the Commissioner handpick

19:00.566 --> 19:02.900
his son Danny
for this investigation?"

19:02.902 --> 19:03.850
What should I say?

19:03.852 --> 19:06.353
Say no.

19:06.355 --> 19:07.488
Henry?

19:07.490 --> 19:08.872
I talked to him.

19:08.874 --> 19:09.957
Is he penitent?

19:09.959 --> 19:11.458
Not especially.

19:11.460 --> 19:14.161
I don't want to see this
in the papers, Garrett.

19:14.163 --> 19:16.130
I'll figure out a way
to kill it.

19:17.132 --> 19:20.701
I need you to run
this down for me.

19:20.703 --> 19:22.970
Find out everything you can.

19:27.559 --> 19:29.476
Strictly confidential.

19:32.046 --> 19:34.048
It's time
to give it up, Benny.

19:34.050 --> 19:36.600
Did you kill Levi
so he could become Grand Rabbi?

19:36.602 --> 19:38.102
No way.

19:38.104 --> 19:40.921
Me and Levi left shul
around the same time.

19:40.923 --> 19:43.274
But when I got into the car
to go to the cemetery,

19:43.276 --> 19:45.693
Levi was alive,
talking on the phone.

19:45.695 --> 19:46.944
Uh-huh.

19:46.946 --> 19:49.062
Men I was with will tell you
the same thing.

19:49.064 --> 19:51.064
We're gonna
need those names.

19:51.950 --> 19:54.034
I don't answer to women.

19:54.036 --> 19:55.836
Well, you know,
maybe you should try it.

19:55.838 --> 19:57.421
You might learn something.

19:57.423 --> 19:59.089
Look, even if you didn't
kill Levi,

19:59.091 --> 20:00.758
we've still got you
resisting arrest.

20:02.544 --> 20:05.546
You want us to add
disorderly conduct to that?

20:06.849 --> 20:09.082
Do you two, uh, <i>shtup</i>
this girl at the same time

20:09.084 --> 20:10.467
or do you take turns?

20:10.469 --> 20:11.685
- What'd you say?
- Danny,

20:11.687 --> 20:12.720
Danny, Danny...
What the hell did you say?

20:12.722 --> 20:14.921
Look, Danny.

20:14.923 --> 20:16.357
You could beat
this guy all night;

20:16.359 --> 20:17.858
he's not gonna give it up.

20:17.860 --> 20:19.593
Let me give it a shot.

20:22.447 --> 20:24.648
Go ahead.

21:27.362 --> 21:30.497
Levi's killer isn't part
of the community.

21:42.060 --> 21:44.177
This needs something.

21:44.179 --> 21:45.779
No, it's good.

21:45.781 --> 21:48.732
Nah, something's missing.

21:48.734 --> 21:50.150
Grandpa's touch?

21:50.152 --> 21:52.202
That must be it.

21:52.204 --> 21:55.021
What did he call it?

21:55.023 --> 21:57.958
He's "sitting shiva."

21:57.960 --> 22:02.129
It's the blessing and the curse
of getting to be his age--

22:02.131 --> 22:04.548
you go to a lot of funerals.

22:04.550 --> 22:07.367
At least they're not his own.

22:08.386 --> 22:10.671
Yeah.

22:11.973 --> 22:14.875
I got a visit from the
former mayor today.

22:14.877 --> 22:15.976
Yeah? How's he doing?

22:15.978 --> 22:17.227
He's kind of wound up.

22:17.229 --> 22:20.046
His daughter got collared
for smoking pot in the park.

22:23.234 --> 22:24.885
Rebecca Levitt.

22:24.887 --> 22:26.386
Yep.

22:26.388 --> 22:29.189
It was legit all the way.

22:29.191 --> 22:30.524
I'm sure it was.

22:30.526 --> 22:32.326
But I didn't know who she was.

22:32.328 --> 22:33.974
If you did know who
she was, would you have

22:33.999 --> 22:35.507
handled it differently?

22:36.915 --> 22:38.248
Nope.

22:38.250 --> 22:40.417
Good answer.

22:41.569 --> 22:44.087
She was a real
piece of work, too.

22:44.089 --> 22:46.423
I've had gangbangers
show me more respect.

22:46.425 --> 22:48.792
People treat you like you're
special your whole life,

22:48.794 --> 22:50.794
eventually you start
to believe it.

22:53.765 --> 22:56.583
<i>Levi was into something</i>
<i>that got him killed.</i>

22:56.585 --> 22:58.769
Maybe he was doing
some business on the side.

22:58.771 --> 23:01.004
But the Grand Rebbe's
a very rich man.

23:01.006 --> 23:03.807
Levi stood to inherit
that fortune.

23:03.809 --> 23:05.258
What about drugs?

23:05.260 --> 23:07.260
I mean, I remember
the cartels using

23:07.262 --> 23:09.279
the Hasidics for
drug mules or something.

23:09.281 --> 23:12.649
Again, money's not an issue,
so why take the risk?

23:12.651 --> 23:14.034
M.E.'s report.

23:14.036 --> 23:15.068
Anything we could use?

23:15.070 --> 23:16.436
They found a long, blond hair

23:16.438 --> 23:17.654
on Levi's groin area.

23:17.656 --> 23:19.156
And his Rivka isn't a blonde.

23:19.158 --> 23:21.291
So maybe our
good little Jewish boy

23:21.293 --> 23:23.944
was taking a walk
on the wild side.

23:40.881 --> 23:42.515
Asher Lefko.

23:42.517 --> 23:44.917
What is it now, Detectives?

23:44.919 --> 23:46.652
We got evidence
that Levi Morgenthal

23:46.654 --> 23:48.504
was having
an extramarital affair.

23:48.506 --> 23:51.357
I don't know
anything about that.

23:51.359 --> 23:53.176
That's kind of tough
to believe, Asher,

23:53.178 --> 23:55.595
considering the guy
hardly ever left your sight.

23:55.597 --> 23:56.929
Levi's dead.

23:56.931 --> 23:59.098
Let him rest in peace.

23:59.100 --> 24:01.017
It doesn't work that way.

24:01.019 --> 24:02.935
Trust me,

24:02.937 --> 24:05.605
you do not want to lie
to New York City detectives

24:05.607 --> 24:07.990
during the course of a
homicide investigation.

24:07.992 --> 24:10.827
Do you understand what
I'm saying to you?

24:14.414 --> 24:17.500
Now, did he have
a girlfriend or not?

24:24.091 --> 24:26.042
Her name is Karen Waters.

24:26.044 --> 24:29.962
She's got a shop
over on North 3rd.

24:33.600 --> 24:35.685
<i>So, when did you and Levi meet?</i>

24:35.687 --> 24:39.238
Seven months ago,
Levi came into the shop.

24:39.240 --> 24:43.476
Um... he was
just browsing and...

24:43.478 --> 24:44.811
we started talking.

24:44.813 --> 24:48.731
He wasn't like anyone
I'd ever met before.

24:48.733 --> 24:50.950
And the feeling
was obviously mutual.

24:50.952 --> 24:54.937
He was an amazing guy.

24:54.939 --> 24:58.991
You know,
he was smart and funny.

24:58.993 --> 25:02.278
And... he called me
his shiksa goddess.

25:03.997 --> 25:07.967
At first, I took that
as a compliment.

25:07.969 --> 25:10.002
How serious did it get
between you two?

25:10.004 --> 25:12.421
You mean, were we in love?

25:12.423 --> 25:14.173
I thought so.

25:14.175 --> 25:15.925
So what happened?

25:15.927 --> 25:18.511
I wanted him to move in
with me, you know?

25:18.513 --> 25:20.963
I wanted to see
if we could make it work

25:20.965 --> 25:22.148
outside of
the sneaking around.

25:22.150 --> 25:24.133
But he wouldn't
go along with that?

25:24.135 --> 25:25.852
No.

25:25.854 --> 25:28.821
He said that I had no idea
what I was asking of him.

25:28.823 --> 25:31.691
That, even though he was
in an unhappy marriage,

25:31.693 --> 25:34.643
that, uh... he would
never betray his people

25:34.645 --> 25:36.362
his father's will.

25:36.364 --> 25:38.314
That's a big step.

25:38.316 --> 25:39.866
Trust me.

25:43.320 --> 25:46.672
So...  it was okay
for him to have sex with me

25:46.674 --> 25:49.258
and convince me that he cared,
but... and all the while

25:49.260 --> 25:51.878
he knew that he was never
gonna be with me?

25:53.347 --> 25:55.965
He said that
it was a sin against God!

25:55.967 --> 25:59.268
I mean, do you have any idea
how that makes me feel?

26:00.604 --> 26:03.389
Did you have sex with Levi
the morning he was killed?

26:03.391 --> 26:05.057
Yes, I did.

26:05.059 --> 26:06.058
Um, I'm sorry.

26:06.060 --> 26:07.693
He... was upset.

26:07.695 --> 26:09.362
He was fighting with Rivka.

26:09.364 --> 26:10.947
She suspected something.

26:10.949 --> 26:13.849
She...  wanted a divorce.

26:15.185 --> 26:16.152
She said that?

26:16.154 --> 26:18.037
Yes.

26:20.457 --> 26:23.492
But, you know, Levi,
he could never...

26:23.494 --> 26:26.462
handle a scandal like that.

26:26.464 --> 26:30.499
I guess Rivka and I
had that in common.

26:30.501 --> 26:32.551
Tell you right now,
hell hath no fury

26:32.553 --> 26:35.821
like a shiksa scorned.
She's got a motive and no alibi.

26:35.823 --> 26:37.556
Yeah, but she
really loved Levi.

26:37.558 --> 26:41.093
She doesn't exactly seem the type
to gut a guy with a knife, either.

26:41.095 --> 26:43.980
Karen did say
something interesting, though--

26:43.982 --> 26:46.048
that Rivka Morgenthal
wanted a divorce.

26:46.050 --> 26:47.733
Right-- is that something
that's not allowed in

26:47.758 --> 26:48.735
the Hasidic community?

26:48.736 --> 26:50.653
No, the women can't ask
for a divorce.

26:50.655 --> 26:52.655
Only the husband can file
for a <i>get.</i>

26:52.657 --> 26:54.991
If the husband doesn't sign off,
the woman is stuck.

26:54.993 --> 26:57.410
Yet another reason I won't be
converting any time soon.

26:57.412 --> 26:59.395
So there was no way out
of the marriage for her?

26:59.397 --> 27:03.082
The death of her husband.

27:03.084 --> 27:05.117
Maybe we should call
your mom again,

27:05.119 --> 27:08.788
see if she can tell us where
we can find Rivka Morgenthal.

27:13.343 --> 27:16.362
Rivka Morgenthal, we need
to ask you a few questions.

27:16.364 --> 27:18.464
Don't you people
have any respect?

27:18.466 --> 27:20.366
Look, we know
she wanted a divorce.

27:20.368 --> 27:21.467
So, what happened?

27:21.469 --> 27:23.185
Did you find out
Levi was having an affair?

27:23.187 --> 27:24.637
Hey, leave her alone.

27:24.639 --> 27:25.754
Take it easy.

27:25.756 --> 27:27.440
I loved my husband.

27:27.442 --> 27:28.757
Yeah, but he
didn't love you.

27:28.759 --> 27:30.059
That must've
made you angry.

27:30.061 --> 27:31.644
Yeah. Angry enough to kill him?

27:31.646 --> 27:33.429
I mean, that is
the only way you could

27:33.431 --> 27:34.763
actually get a divorce, right?

27:34.765 --> 27:36.148
I would never do such a thing.

27:36.150 --> 27:38.651
But he cheated on you,
he humiliated you.

27:40.904 --> 27:44.156
I could never please my husband.

27:46.943 --> 27:49.545
I wanted children...

27:49.547 --> 27:53.115
but Levi would never...

27:53.117 --> 27:55.451
he... he wouldn't be with me.

27:57.838 --> 28:01.173
If he sinned with another woman,
it's my sin, too.

28:01.175 --> 28:03.959
Do you intend to arrest
Mrs. Morgenthal?

28:04.895 --> 28:06.795
Not yet.
No?

28:06.797 --> 28:09.482
Then this conversation is over.

28:09.484 --> 28:11.650
Go ahead.

28:15.456 --> 28:17.456
That went well.

28:17.458 --> 28:19.425
Better than I expected.

28:19.427 --> 28:21.444
The lab identified
an animal hair

28:21.446 --> 28:23.129
on Levi Morgenthal's jacket--

28:23.131 --> 28:25.097
some kind
of rare gray fox.

28:25.099 --> 28:28.501
So, what, the perp we're chasing's
got claws and whiskers?

28:28.503 --> 28:31.087
Hasidim take a lot of pride
in their <i>shtreimels.</i>

28:31.089 --> 28:32.755
Yeah, don't all guys?

28:32.757 --> 28:34.457
No, <i>shtreimels</i>
are traditional hats

28:34.459 --> 28:36.675
worn by Hasidic men
on special occasions.

28:36.677 --> 28:38.377
They cost a fortune.

28:38.379 --> 28:41.013
Usually, they use mink,
but if you've got serious money,

28:41.015 --> 28:42.798
the sky's the limit.

28:42.800 --> 28:44.617
I think it's time
we see Moishe.

28:44.619 --> 28:46.852
Moishe?
Hasidic hatmaker to the stars.

28:46.854 --> 28:50.406
Good. Hopefully, he can
lead us to the Promised Land.

28:53.110 --> 28:54.527
Hi. Please.

28:54.529 --> 28:56.228
Thank you.
The coffee here

28:56.230 --> 28:58.230
is still horrible.

28:58.232 --> 29:00.616
So, I spoke
with the arresting officer

29:00.618 --> 29:02.118
on Rebecca's case.

29:02.120 --> 29:04.370
He reported that she was...

29:04.372 --> 29:07.022
disrespectful, noncompliant...

29:07.024 --> 29:08.374
She's 16, for God's sake.

29:08.376 --> 29:11.026
Okay? Disrespectful and
noncompliant is a badge of honor.

29:11.028 --> 29:13.079
Not when you're
dealing with police.

29:13.081 --> 29:16.715
No, you're right.
Of course.

29:16.717 --> 29:18.467
You think a...

29:18.469 --> 29:20.503
you think a judge will
send her to jail?

29:20.505 --> 29:23.639
Well, the girl she was with
got off with a warning,

29:23.641 --> 29:25.707
but if Rebecca
mouths off in court...

29:25.709 --> 29:27.476
I am embarrassed
to admit this, Erin,

29:27.478 --> 29:30.429
but... Rebecca
won't listen to me.

29:30.431 --> 29:33.983
I used to run this
entire city, yeah?

29:33.985 --> 29:36.569
I can't even control
a 16-year-old kid.

29:38.438 --> 29:41.740
Well, I have one of my own.

29:41.742 --> 29:45.194
I also know from experience...

29:45.196 --> 29:46.395
that being the daughter

29:46.397 --> 29:48.114
of one of the most powerful men
in the city

29:48.116 --> 29:49.865
is not always easy.

29:49.867 --> 29:52.368
You turned out okay.

29:52.370 --> 29:55.454
Well, there were
some close calls.

29:57.791 --> 30:01.043
When I was 15,
Margaret Connolly and I

30:01.045 --> 30:05.431
wanted to drive to a party
on the Jersey shore.

30:05.433 --> 30:07.583
I assume Frank didn't
hand you his keys.

30:07.585 --> 30:09.385
Never bothered asking.

30:10.770 --> 30:12.254
Our next-door neighbor,
Mrs. Oliveri,

30:12.256 --> 30:15.107
kept her keys in the ashtray
of her station wagon.

30:15.109 --> 30:16.542
Oh, brother.
Uh-huh.

30:16.544 --> 30:17.943
I made it seven blocks

30:17.945 --> 30:20.779
before I smashed
into the construction barricade.

30:20.781 --> 30:23.649
The wheel got stuck
in a open manhole.

30:23.651 --> 30:25.934
And when Frank
found out...?

30:25.936 --> 30:28.270
It was not pretty.

30:28.272 --> 30:30.122
But he helped you out, right?

30:30.124 --> 30:31.657
No.

30:32.609 --> 30:35.494
No. He said...

30:35.496 --> 30:37.329
"This is your mess.

30:37.331 --> 30:39.615
I suggest you clean it up."

30:41.801 --> 30:45.004
So I had to beg Mrs. Oliveri
not to press charges,

30:45.006 --> 30:48.790
and I had to come up
with $2,700 to fix her car.

30:51.428 --> 30:53.179
As parents,

30:53.181 --> 30:57.132
our first instinct
is to fix everything...

30:57.134 --> 31:01.270
and... sometimes
that just makes things worse.

31:01.272 --> 31:03.739
Yeah.

31:07.944 --> 31:09.078
Moishe, this is
Detective Reagan,

31:09.080 --> 31:10.779
Oh.
and this is Detective McElroy.

31:10.781 --> 31:12.498
We're working on a case together.
It's an honor.

31:12.500 --> 31:15.334
It's a joy to meet you, sir, a joy.
You, too.

31:15.336 --> 31:17.369
Oh, I heard about the case.

31:17.371 --> 31:19.338
They should string him up,

31:19.340 --> 31:21.490
that <i>rotseyakh</i>
that killed him.

31:21.492 --> 31:23.825
Wolf tells us that
you make the hats

31:23.827 --> 31:25.461
for most of the community.

31:25.463 --> 31:27.713
For the last 60 years.

31:27.715 --> 31:31.050
Not <i>ongepotchket schlock,</i>
you know, by me.

31:31.052 --> 31:32.851
Everything is the best.

31:32.853 --> 31:34.770
We found some gray fox fur
on Levi's coat.

31:34.772 --> 31:37.556
Do you ever use that in any
of the hats that you make?

31:37.558 --> 31:39.341
Oh, hardly ever.

31:39.343 --> 31:41.360
That stuff is very expensive.

31:41.362 --> 31:43.896
Try to remember, Moishe;
this is very important.

31:43.898 --> 31:45.347
That's no problem.

31:45.349 --> 31:49.785
I've learned one thing-- that
you must write everything down.

31:49.787 --> 31:51.403
You know, they got
computers for that now.

31:51.405 --> 31:54.990
Do you think I'm gonna let
that meshuggener box here

31:54.992 --> 31:56.858
tell me what I'm supposed
to think?

31:56.860 --> 31:58.527
Never happen.

31:58.529 --> 32:01.880
I'll never go with this
meshuggener box here.

32:01.882 --> 32:04.667
Oh, wait a minute,
here it is-- I got it!

32:04.669 --> 32:06.085
I got it!

32:06.087 --> 32:09.088
Four years, past July.

32:09.090 --> 32:10.539
Quite an order, I see.

32:10.541 --> 32:12.374
Mink, gray fox.

32:12.376 --> 32:15.010
Boy, that was
one hell of a <i>shtreimel.</i>

32:15.012 --> 32:17.313
Do your records show
who you sold it to?

32:17.315 --> 32:19.064
Of course. Absolutely.

32:19.066 --> 32:21.016
Levi Morgenthal.

32:22.018 --> 32:24.320
The hairs were
off of Levi's own hat.

32:24.322 --> 32:25.521
He bought the hat.

32:25.523 --> 32:27.323
I never said that he wore it.

32:27.325 --> 32:29.992
What do you mean?
He came back to pick it up,

32:29.994 --> 32:32.561
and I told him that
I'll help him fit it on.

32:32.563 --> 32:35.414
So he told me that
he didn't buy it for himself,

32:35.416 --> 32:36.999
he bought it as a present.

32:37.001 --> 32:38.900
Okay, do you remember
who he bought it for?

32:38.902 --> 32:42.454
He bought it for his <i>gabbai,</i>
Asher Lefko.

32:42.456 --> 32:45.574
They were both <i>mishpocha.</i>
Best friends.

32:45.576 --> 32:47.376
You've been a big help, Moishe.

32:47.378 --> 32:48.577
Thank you. We owe you one.

32:48.579 --> 32:50.180
Ah, thank you.
And you do beautiful work.

32:50.181 --> 32:51.964
Wait-wait-wait a minute.

32:51.966 --> 32:54.266
You say I do great work?
Yeah.

32:54.268 --> 32:56.602
Do you see that hat,
how beautiful it is?

32:56.604 --> 32:57.603
That's beautiful.

32:57.605 --> 32:59.138
I love this hat.

32:59.140 --> 33:01.590
Detective... try it on.

33:01.592 --> 33:03.942
No, I couldn't.
No, no, come on, come on.

33:03.944 --> 33:05.477
Try it on.
Go for it.

33:05.479 --> 33:06.695
Go for it, you'll love it.

33:06.697 --> 33:08.981
Thanks.

33:08.983 --> 33:10.649
It's not against the
custom or anything?

33:10.651 --> 33:12.034
We don't have customs here.

33:12.036 --> 33:13.902
All right.

33:13.904 --> 33:15.204
Huh?

33:15.206 --> 33:16.288
There, you...

33:16.290 --> 33:17.289
Huh?
You see?

33:21.328 --> 33:22.711
What'd he say?

33:22.713 --> 33:24.463
Uh, it's an old Yiddish proverb.

33:24.465 --> 33:26.615
If you put a <i>shtreimel</i> on a pig,

33:26.617 --> 33:28.217
would it be a rabbi?

33:29.337 --> 33:30.469
Yes.

33:30.471 --> 33:31.720
That's funny.

33:31.722 --> 33:33.756
Thank you again.
Oh, you're welcome.

33:33.758 --> 33:34.890
All right, you've
been a big help.

33:34.892 --> 33:36.141
Thank you. Come back.
All right.

33:36.143 --> 33:38.594
Why would Lefko
kill his best friend?

33:38.596 --> 33:40.479
Well, he knew about Levi's
affair, right?

33:40.481 --> 33:41.630
And he obviously
didn't approve,

33:41.632 --> 33:43.382
and you see the way
he looks at the widow.

33:43.384 --> 33:45.133
You think there's something
going on between those two?

33:45.135 --> 33:46.618
There's a motive.
So, let's pick him up.

33:46.620 --> 33:47.820
No, we can't. Not a witness.

33:47.822 --> 33:49.438
All we got on Lefko is some fur,

33:49.440 --> 33:52.107
and his lawyer's gonna
say he was around Levi 24-7,

33:52.109 --> 33:53.525
and the fur proves nothing.

33:53.527 --> 33:55.277
Lefko's definitely our guy.

33:55.279 --> 33:56.495
How do we collar him?

33:56.497 --> 33:58.247
Maybe we got to get
him to confess.

33:58.249 --> 34:00.032
And how, exactly, do
you propose we do that?

34:00.034 --> 34:01.834
Crime of passion,
the way you get somebody

34:01.836 --> 34:03.235
is you go after what they love.

34:03.237 --> 34:06.088
So, let's go after
what he loves.

34:11.878 --> 34:14.362
Oh, I haven't seen that
for a while.

34:14.364 --> 34:17.649
You used to be a pretty
good-looking guy, Pop.

34:17.650 --> 34:19.601
Still am.

34:23.556 --> 34:25.891
Listen...

34:27.393 --> 34:28.860
I've been thinking
about something

34:28.862 --> 34:31.980
that Solomon Morgenthal
said to me.

34:32.899 --> 34:35.701
About how a father
owes his son the truth.

34:35.703 --> 34:37.870
Like telling Jacob
he wasn't chosen?

34:37.871 --> 34:40.572
That must have been a
pretty tough conversation.

34:40.574 --> 34:42.206
But he had it.

34:42.208 --> 34:43.876
It was the right thing to do.

34:50.801 --> 34:55.637
I was married to your mother
for 46 years.

34:55.639 --> 34:59.725
I never betrayed a secret
she asked me to keep.

34:59.727 --> 35:03.145
But I'm gonna do that now.

35:04.849 --> 35:08.817
You had an older brother,
Francis.

35:14.056 --> 35:16.241
Peter Christopher Reagan.

35:16.243 --> 35:18.677
How the hell
did you find that out?

35:18.679 --> 35:22.831
You never had much
of a poker face, Pop.

35:22.833 --> 35:26.201
I sent Garrett down
to the Office of Vital Records.

35:27.570 --> 35:29.204
I hope that was okay.

35:30.925 --> 35:35.577
Peter was diagnosed
with leukemia.

35:35.579 --> 35:38.347
18 months old when he died.

35:40.266 --> 35:41.884
You were born
the next year.

35:45.104 --> 35:46.889
It was your mother's call.

35:52.980 --> 35:55.731
The Irish and their secrets.

35:58.101 --> 36:01.537
I don't have to tell you
how much your mother loved you.

36:03.323 --> 36:05.440
She didn't want you growing up

36:05.442 --> 36:08.126
missing someone you never knew.

36:10.880 --> 36:12.581
Neither did I.

36:31.719 --> 36:32.969
I'm calling a lawyer.

36:32.971 --> 36:34.354
Yeah, well,

36:34.356 --> 36:35.864
I hope you're calling him
for her.

36:35.865 --> 36:38.115
Tell him to meet us downtown.
Cuff her.

36:38.117 --> 36:39.583
Rivka Morgenthal,
you're under arrest

36:39.585 --> 36:40.884
for the murder
of your husband.

36:40.886 --> 36:41.952
What is this, a joke?

36:41.954 --> 36:44.004
We've got a witness
who saw a woman

36:44.006 --> 36:45.756
matching Rivka's
description leave the scene

36:45.758 --> 36:47.041
shortly after the murder.

36:47.043 --> 36:48.342
What, dark clothes?

36:48.344 --> 36:49.426
Floral headscarf?

36:49.428 --> 36:50.627
Every woman in Williamsburg

36:50.629 --> 36:52.713
matches that description.
Yeah, but only one woman

36:52.715 --> 36:54.965
in Williamsburg wanted to kill
Levi for having an affair.

36:54.967 --> 36:55.899
Now, back up.

36:55.901 --> 36:57.250
But I told you
I was at home.

36:57.252 --> 36:58.519
Which no one
can confirm.

36:58.521 --> 36:59.770
That's right.

36:59.772 --> 37:01.772
You were pissed off
that Levi was screwing around,

37:01.774 --> 37:04.058
so you went to the synagogue
to find him and kill him.

37:04.060 --> 37:06.060
No.
Come on, leave her alone.

37:06.062 --> 37:07.644
Asher takes good
care of you, Rivka.

37:07.646 --> 37:08.812
Is that why you killed Levi?

37:08.814 --> 37:10.114
So you could be with him?

37:10.116 --> 37:11.482
You know what,
we'll sort this out

37:11.484 --> 37:12.533
down at the squad.
Get her out of here.

37:12.535 --> 37:13.617
Stop, stop, stop!
What?

37:13.619 --> 37:14.618
Stop!

37:14.620 --> 37:16.620
Or what?!

37:19.124 --> 37:21.075
It was me; I did it.

37:22.794 --> 37:23.877
No, I'll be fine, Asher.

37:23.879 --> 37:25.112
Don't make up stories.

37:25.114 --> 37:27.331
I kill-- I killed him.

37:31.052 --> 37:32.285
Asher Lefko,

37:32.287 --> 37:33.720
you're under arrest.

37:33.722 --> 37:36.223
Anything you say can and will
be used against you

37:36.225 --> 37:38.175
in a court of law.
My God, Asher.

37:39.477 --> 37:40.427
Why?

37:40.429 --> 37:43.397
Because he treated you
like dirt.

37:43.399 --> 37:44.898
Listen to me.

37:44.900 --> 37:46.316
He shamed you.

37:48.970 --> 37:50.804
He doesn't deserve
a woman like you.

37:50.806 --> 37:52.022
Oh, but you
did, right?

37:52.024 --> 37:54.274
Oh... Asher...

37:54.276 --> 37:55.776
I wa... I wasn't a rebbe's son,

37:55.778 --> 37:57.361
but I-I always loved you.

37:58.696 --> 38:01.314
Come on, get him out of here.

38:02.167 --> 38:04.034
You sinned against God, and you
No.

38:04.036 --> 38:05.119
sinned against me!
Take it easy. Take it easy.

38:05.121 --> 38:06.303
Back up, back up.

38:12.544 --> 38:15.012
Look, we're sorry for your loss.

38:15.014 --> 38:16.329
Truly.

38:26.307 --> 38:28.192
Miss Levitt, it's
alleged that you were

38:28.194 --> 38:30.277
in possession of and
smoked a lighted

38:30.279 --> 38:31.712
marijuana cigarette
in public view.

38:31.714 --> 38:33.063
Do you dispute
the charges?

38:33.065 --> 38:34.615
Whatever.

38:35.483 --> 38:37.034
Excuse me?

38:37.036 --> 38:41.455
Yes, we were
smoking pot, okay?

38:43.158 --> 38:44.324
The report also cites

38:44.326 --> 38:46.109
that you were disrespectful
and uncooperative

38:46.111 --> 38:47.711
at the time of
your arrest.

38:47.713 --> 38:49.863
Care to explain?

38:49.865 --> 38:51.081
Uh...

38:51.083 --> 38:53.000
not really.

38:55.386 --> 38:57.171
Your Honor,
my client's father

38:57.173 --> 38:59.306
has requested to
address the court.

38:59.308 --> 39:01.041
Of course.
It's an honor to have you

39:01.043 --> 39:02.375
in this courtroom, Mr. Mayor.

39:02.377 --> 39:03.710
Uh, thank you, Your Honor.

39:03.712 --> 39:07.214
Um, I'd just like to say,
Your Honor, that...

39:07.216 --> 39:12.269
my daughter is
a wonderful young woman...

39:16.608 --> 39:19.610
...who needs to learn
to respect the law,

39:19.612 --> 39:21.745
and that actions
have consequences.

39:21.747 --> 39:23.413
I couldn't agree more.

39:23.415 --> 39:24.564
Daddy...!

39:24.566 --> 39:26.833
Robert...
No, this is way overdue.

39:26.835 --> 39:28.535
Miss Levitt, I hereby
sentence you

39:28.537 --> 39:30.237
to a $500 fine

39:30.239 --> 39:31.955
and 1,000 hours
of community service.

39:31.957 --> 39:34.958
There's a drug rehab facility
at Battery Park City

39:34.960 --> 39:36.409
that's been closed
since Hurricane Sandy.

39:36.411 --> 39:38.595
I'm sure they could
use a helping hand

39:38.597 --> 39:39.596
to clean things up.

39:40.599 --> 39:42.516
Next case.

39:49.390 --> 39:51.058
This roll tastes weird.

39:51.060 --> 39:52.526
That's 'cause it's a knish.

39:52.528 --> 39:53.894
What's a knish?

39:53.896 --> 39:55.395
It's like a potato pie.

39:55.397 --> 39:57.447
It's Jewish food
for Irish people.

39:57.449 --> 39:58.815
You should try the kreplach.

39:58.817 --> 40:00.100
Oh, it's amazing, right?

40:00.102 --> 40:02.736
I never eat anything
with the word "crap" in it.

40:03.739 --> 40:04.604
Ditto.

40:04.606 --> 40:06.240
It's "krep," wisenheimer.

40:06.242 --> 40:07.958
And I think it was
very thoughtful

40:07.960 --> 40:10.327
of Jacob Morgenthal
to send this stuff over.

40:11.829 --> 40:14.047
He says thank you for the job
you did, Danny.

40:14.049 --> 40:15.299
Oh, well, I'm glad.

40:15.301 --> 40:16.917
I was a little rough on him.

40:16.919 --> 40:19.386
Can you imagine having to choose
between two sons like that?

40:19.388 --> 40:22.756
No. And that is not a choice
I will have to make.

40:23.958 --> 40:25.676
But if you did,
who would make Commissioner?

40:25.678 --> 40:26.927
Danny or me?

40:26.929 --> 40:28.762
What am I, chopped liver?

40:28.764 --> 40:30.430
Well, hold on, you're a
girl, you don't count.

40:30.432 --> 40:32.316
I'm a girl? What does
that mean, I'm a girl?

40:32.318 --> 40:34.134
A girl could never
be Commissioner.

40:34.136 --> 40:35.302
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

40:35.304 --> 40:36.603
Oh, really?

40:36.605 --> 40:38.572
Wait, wait-- Dad, if you had
to choose, who would it be?

40:38.574 --> 40:40.073
Danny, me, or Erin?

40:40.942 --> 40:43.160
Well, you have the perspective.

40:43.162 --> 40:45.746
You have the tenacity.

40:46.647 --> 40:47.981
Huh? Come on.

40:47.983 --> 40:49.082
What do I got?

40:51.320 --> 40:53.003
You have the fire in the belly.

40:54.089 --> 40:55.956
I got the fire in the belly.

40:55.958 --> 40:57.291
Yeah, it's called gas.

40:58.344 --> 41:00.711
Dad, who would you choose,
seriously?

41:02.764 --> 41:04.881
Keep learning and ask me again
in another year.

41:06.135 --> 41:07.351
That's not an answer, Dad.

41:07.353 --> 41:09.219
Yeah, epic fail, Dad.
That's a dodge.

41:09.221 --> 41:12.973
Pass some more of, uh,
whatever that is.

41:15.176 --> 41:17.611
Here you go.

41:30.691 --> 41:31.908
Mad at me?

41:31.910 --> 41:34.161
No.

41:44.038 --> 41:45.639
Mad at your mom?

41:45.641 --> 41:48.175
No way.

41:57.685 --> 41:59.736
I'm sorry you lost a son, Pop.

42:04.392 --> 42:07.494
Well, we have that
in common, too.

42:10.898 --> 42:15.402
Been carrying this with me...

42:15.404 --> 42:18.571
all these years.

42:19.874 --> 42:23.043
I think maybe
you should have it.

42:31.853 --> 42:33.470
He was a good kid.

42:34.939 --> 42:37.307
Just like you.
