00:19.733 --> 00:21.928
Dr. Longenhahn,
here's the body.

00:24.404 --> 00:26.770
They weren't kidding,
were they?

00:26.840 --> 00:28.774
They said they did about
the best they could...

00:28.842 --> 00:31.106
considering he was all mashed
in with that garbage.

00:31.311 --> 00:33.404
( grunts )

00:33.480 --> 00:35.448
How mashed up is he?

00:35.482 --> 00:37.450
Basically, it's hamburger.

00:40.754 --> 00:42.688
Oh.

00:46.560 --> 00:48.494
And they want me
to do what exactly?

00:48.562 --> 00:53.090
The order was to establish
and confirm real fact of death.

00:53.333 --> 00:56.359
I'd say he's dead.
How about you?

00:56.436 --> 00:58.666
- Yes, sir.
- Good. I'm going home.

00:58.739 --> 01:02.140
You fax me the paperwork by 9:00,
I'll sign it, everybody's happy.

01:03.710 --> 01:06.474
Oh, cryin' out loud.
See this?

01:08.048 --> 01:13.418
They left some garbage
in with it.

01:16.723 --> 01:20.682
Looks kinda like a vertebrae,
only metallic.

01:25.399 --> 01:27.731
Note it on the report.

01:27.801 --> 01:29.735
Then fax me.

02:55.889 --> 02:58.449
Oh, God.

02:58.525 --> 03:00.686
I was hoping
this was all a dream.

03:03.163 --> 03:06.860
- When'd the sun come up?
- About six hours ago.

03:06.933 --> 03:11.529
- Somewhere back in North Carolina.
- Where are we?

03:11.571 --> 03:14.563
We just crossed
into Georgia.

03:14.641 --> 03:18.133
A long way from home,
Agent Scully.

03:18.211 --> 03:21.078
Under the circumstances.

03:22.482 --> 03:26.145
Right.
We can't be too safe.

03:27.787 --> 03:30.085
Are you all right,
Agent Reyes?

03:31.124 --> 03:33.092
I should ask
how you're doing.

03:33.126 --> 03:36.095
I mean, you're the one
who's gonna have this baby.

03:36.129 --> 03:38.188
That's it, isn't it?

03:39.733 --> 03:42.201
What you're really
worried about?

03:43.637 --> 03:47.004
Aside from whatever
danger we're in...

03:47.073 --> 03:49.633
where we're going
doesn't sound like...

03:49.676 --> 03:51.940
there's all that much
in the way of a facility.

03:53.880 --> 03:56.508
You know what I mean?

03:56.583 --> 03:58.813
I-- I've never
delivered a baby.

04:00.687 --> 04:03.986
Well, I've never had one.
That makes us both beginners.

04:10.030 --> 04:12.692
MULDER: This is a videograph
from the D.C. Morgue.

04:14.768 --> 04:17.737
- It's Billy Miles.
- How can that be?

04:17.803 --> 04:19.930
It can't be.
It's impossible.

04:20.005 --> 04:22.132
Yeah, it can't be,
but it is...

04:22.208 --> 04:25.541
walking out of the morgue
lookin' like a new man.

04:25.579 --> 04:27.774
His body was taken to the morgue
in a little box, for God's sake.

04:27.847 --> 04:31.681
Like I told ya,
you can't stop him.

04:31.751 --> 04:34.777
Yeah, you know, you keep
saying that, Krycek.

04:34.854 --> 04:37.880
Why don't you explain it
to us because I'm having
a little bit of a hard time...

04:37.924 --> 04:39.892
understanding it myself.

04:39.926 --> 04:42.759
Billy Miles was scraped out of
the back of a garbage truck.

04:42.829 --> 04:45.593
I saw him go in.
I saw him come out.

04:49.102 --> 04:52.265
Well, I don't know if I can explain it
in any technical sense, but...

04:55.075 --> 04:57.066
that's Billy Miles
without a doubt.

04:57.143 --> 05:00.772
You're sitting there for one reason,
Krycek, because you can't explain it.

05:00.814 --> 05:03.647
I told you
he's a human replacement.

05:03.717 --> 05:06.083
Some new kind of alien...

05:07.988 --> 05:10.616
created to aid in
the repopulation of the planet.

05:10.690 --> 05:14.353
- Which Scully's a threat to.
- If she has that baby.

05:14.594 --> 05:17.825
I don't care who he is or what
you think he's made of...

05:17.897 --> 05:19.888
there's no way
he's gonna find her, no way.

05:19.966 --> 05:24.335
Well, maybe he's not, but there
are others out there just like him.

05:27.807 --> 05:30.833
And it's only a matter of time
before they will.

05:30.877 --> 05:33.368
( knocking )

05:33.613 --> 05:37.310
Agent Doggett?
See you a moment?

05:43.256 --> 05:45.190
There's someone here
to see you.

05:51.698 --> 05:53.632
CRANE:
The name is Knowle Rohrer.

05:53.700 --> 05:56.191
He says you know each other
and what he's here for can't wait.

06:16.690 --> 06:18.658
End of the road.

06:18.692 --> 06:20.660
Yeah, literally.

06:22.662 --> 06:26.120
If anybody finds us out here,
it really will be a miracle.

06:27.834 --> 06:32.032
- Where exactly are we?
- Democrat Hot Springs.

06:32.105 --> 06:35.336
According to Agent Doggett,
this is where people used to
come for their waters...

06:35.375 --> 06:37.366
until the springs dried up
and they quit coming.

06:37.444 --> 06:40.675
- He was born here.
- Really.

06:40.747 --> 06:43.079
Well, that's comforting.

06:43.149 --> 06:45.447
I guess.

06:45.685 --> 06:49.883
- So where do you want to set up?
- Over here.

06:52.125 --> 06:55.117
Any particular reason?

06:55.195 --> 06:58.494
I think I told you I feel these energies
about people and stuff...

06:58.732 --> 07:00.495
and places.

07:00.734 --> 07:03.066
I found it works best
to go with my instincts.

07:22.822 --> 07:25.290
I'm getting
a feeling myself.

07:31.931 --> 07:33.899
( squeaks )

07:35.802 --> 07:38.396
Well, there's no water
from this rock.

07:38.471 --> 07:42.908
We're gonna need some water
and a place to boil it.

07:42.942 --> 07:47.242
Along with sterile supplies
and a clean place to do this delivery.

07:50.283 --> 07:53.013
I'm a little stiff
from the drive.

07:57.190 --> 07:59.124
Okay.

08:25.151 --> 08:27.346
It's not like you, Knowle.

08:27.420 --> 08:30.821
Comin' to see me when you make me
work so hard to see you.

08:30.857 --> 08:34.850
This couldn't wait,John.
It's about this thing you're pursuing.

08:34.928 --> 08:37.828
- This thing?
- This man you're after.

08:37.864 --> 08:40.491
I think you know
what I'm talking about.

08:41.601 --> 08:44.034
I think I'm confused,
Knowle...

08:44.102 --> 08:46.594
if it's a man
or it's a thing.

08:46.840 --> 08:49.138
This is military,John.
Goes all the way to the top.

08:49.209 --> 08:51.837
I can't overstate
the sensitivity.

08:53.580 --> 08:59.075
Let me say there was a rumored
program out of the Cold War...

08:59.152 --> 09:01.177
planned to create
a super soldier.

09:01.254 --> 09:05.156
Well, this kid I'm talking about
was pretty damn super.

09:05.225 --> 09:07.955
Got right up out of a gut bucket
and hit the ground running.

09:08.027 --> 09:11.929
The kid wasn't exactly
what I'd call military material.

09:11.998 --> 09:14.967
In fact, they say
he was an alien abductee.

09:15.034 --> 09:18.003
- You got it half right,John.
- Which half?

09:18.071 --> 09:21.472
What you're chasing...
is a prototype.

09:21.541 --> 09:24.066
Uh-huh.

09:24.143 --> 09:26.976
And this
so-called prototype...

09:28.648 --> 09:32.140
- what is he after?
- I think you know that too,John.

09:32.218 --> 09:34.152
He's after
your partner Scully.

09:35.622 --> 09:39.581
You may not be aware that
she was part of a program herself.

09:39.659 --> 09:42.958
Six years ago, Agent Scully was
taken in a military operation...

09:43.029 --> 09:45.088
staged as an abduction.

09:45.164 --> 09:49.260
They put a chip in the back
of her neck to monitor her.

09:49.335 --> 09:51.667
It was also used
to make her pregnant...

09:51.871 --> 09:56.035
with the first organicversion
of that same super soldier.

09:57.110 --> 10:01.046
( chuckles )

10:01.080 --> 10:03.878
What do you want from me?

10:03.917 --> 10:06.385
Help us catch him
so we can put him down...

10:06.452 --> 10:08.386
before he finds her.

10:08.454 --> 10:11.082
You assume
I know where she is.

10:11.157 --> 10:14.092
Who does, your superior?

10:15.361 --> 10:18.262
Whoever knows,
his life is in danger too.

10:18.331 --> 10:20.265
I want you to know.

10:38.551 --> 10:40.485
( bell dings )

10:51.597 --> 10:54.065
Sit down, Krycek!

11:04.043 --> 11:07.069
Hey, what did I tell you?

11:07.146 --> 11:09.080
Hey!

11:14.721 --> 11:16.689
SKINNER:
Krycek!

11:18.691 --> 11:21.421
Krycek, hold the door!

11:24.564 --> 11:26.657
Hold the door, Krycek!
Krycek!

11:34.374 --> 11:36.433
( elevator whirring )

11:58.464 --> 12:00.091
Mulder.

12:11.277 --> 12:13.268
You heard
about this, right?

12:13.346 --> 12:15.314
- How is he?
- He's got a concussion.

12:15.348 --> 12:18.010
They're gonna keep him here
for observation.

12:18.084 --> 12:20.018
Where were you
when this all happened?

12:20.086 --> 12:23.578
In my office, talking to somebody
who warned me this might happen.

12:23.656 --> 12:25.180
Who?

12:25.258 --> 12:27.226
( sighs )

12:27.293 --> 12:31.127
Skinner could have been killed.
He's lucky he wasn't.

12:31.197 --> 12:35.293
He's an old friend. He tells me
stuff I'm not supposed to know.

12:35.368 --> 12:39.464
- I didn't wanna believe it.
- What exactly did he tell you?

12:39.539 --> 12:41.564
He said that Billy Miles
isn't what you think he is.

12:41.641 --> 12:44.701
He's a product of a government program
lookin' to build a super soldier.

12:44.744 --> 12:47.178
He said Agent Scully's
a part of that program too.

12:47.246 --> 12:49.806
And her pregnancy was triggered
by a chip they put in her neck.

12:50.049 --> 12:52.210
I want to know who the hell
you've been talking to!

12:54.420 --> 12:58.083
Who this trusted source of yours is,
who's been spinning this fantasy.

13:02.128 --> 13:05.427
His name's Knowle Rohrer.
He's deep inside U.S. Intelligence

13:05.465 --> 13:08.332
- I don't know much more than that.
- Did he ever lie to you?

13:08.401 --> 13:10.494
Give you bad information?
False leads?

13:12.305 --> 13:16.071
- You have to think about it?
- He said Scully's in danger.

13:16.142 --> 13:18.736
He wants to stop this guy. How's that
so different from what we're saying?

13:18.811 --> 13:21.780
You didn't tell him
where she is, did you?

13:21.848 --> 13:25.375
No. But I'm beginning to think
that the fact that I know...

13:25.451 --> 13:27.885
is gonna catch up with me
if A.D. Skinner's any indication.

13:28.121 --> 13:30.555
You don't tell anybody where she is.
That's the deal, right?

13:30.623 --> 13:32.557
Not even me.

13:32.625 --> 13:35.321
What if something
happens to me?

13:39.899 --> 13:42.265
This, uh, trusted source
of yours...

13:42.335 --> 13:44.701
told you he knows
how to stop Billy Miles.

13:44.737 --> 13:48.195
Did he happen to tell you
how he plans to do this?

13:49.642 --> 13:52.110
- No.
- Right.

13:52.178 --> 13:56.342
What do you say you and me go find
out how trustworthy he really is?

13:59.652 --> 14:02.712
Dana, come see
what you think.

14:08.694 --> 14:11.857
Oh, my goodness!

14:11.931 --> 14:13.899
Look at this.

14:13.933 --> 14:15.901
Look at you.

14:18.337 --> 14:20.271
Wow!

14:33.486 --> 14:36.512
I found them folded up
in a cabinet upstairs...

14:36.589 --> 14:39.786
and a nice porcelain basin
and a whole box of candles.

14:39.825 --> 14:42.191
Do we have matches?

14:42.261 --> 14:46.220
- I've got a lighter.
- Yeah.

14:46.299 --> 14:48.631
Now all we need
is some mood music.

14:48.668 --> 14:51.796
- Like ""Whale Song.""
- ""Whale Song""?

14:51.837 --> 14:56.274
They've got these recordings
of whales talking to each other,
calling back and forth.

14:56.342 --> 15:00.438
( imitating whale calls )

15:02.348 --> 15:06.444
I-I don't know, it's like,
it's almost metaphysical.

15:09.822 --> 15:12.188
You're looking at me like--

15:12.225 --> 15:14.386
I don't know.
I probably sound like a goof.

15:14.460 --> 15:16.587
No, no, it's not that.

15:16.662 --> 15:21.565
Um, I was thinking that you reminded
me of someone that I was close to.

15:21.634 --> 15:24.797
- My sister.
- You're not close to her still?

15:25.938 --> 15:29.965
Uh, she was killed
about five years ago...

15:30.209 --> 15:31.972
in my home.

15:37.316 --> 15:39.477
It was a terrible time.

15:44.223 --> 15:46.282
Well, it's, uh, it's okay.

15:47.827 --> 15:49.795
I want to thank you.

15:49.862 --> 15:52.353
Thank you for...

15:52.431 --> 15:54.626
putting this together.

15:56.235 --> 16:01.730
It's not what I planned,
but, um, it's very nice.

16:05.845 --> 16:07.506
What?

16:07.580 --> 16:10.344
There's someone out there.
Stay here.

16:55.294 --> 16:57.922
Get out of the car!
I'm a federal agent!

17:06.439 --> 17:08.599
I don't care who you are.

17:08.641 --> 17:12.077
Let's start by putting
that weapon away.

17:12.310 --> 17:14.939
Just point it down now.

17:18.651 --> 17:21.711
- I'm a federal agent.
- I heard you the first time.

17:21.787 --> 17:25.086
Just let me see
some identification.

17:36.936 --> 17:39.839
Dana?

17:42.341 --> 17:46.971
I'm sure this looks untoward,
but my life is in danger.

17:47.046 --> 17:49.071
And my baby's.

17:49.148 --> 17:54.017
There's a man who's pursuing us
and it is very important
that he not find us here.

17:54.086 --> 17:56.748
We get hunters in here...

17:56.822 --> 18:00.690
taking deer and game
off-season.

18:00.760 --> 18:04.161
I've heard every excuse in the book,
but this one's far too original.

18:06.132 --> 18:09.158
You don't plan
to have it here?

18:09.368 --> 18:11.461
It's not as crazy
as it sounds.

18:11.537 --> 18:13.971
I mean, I hope it's not.
She's a doctor. She can coach me.

18:14.039 --> 18:17.634
And what if something goes wrong?
If you're a doctor, you know the risks.

18:17.710 --> 18:21.373
- You're unprepared here.
- This man...

18:22.448 --> 18:24.939
he's extremely dangerous.

18:34.493 --> 18:37.087
I got a first-aid kit
in my truck.

18:37.129 --> 18:40.621
It's pretty basic,
but better to have than not.

18:40.699 --> 18:44.430
I'll be back with some towels
and the proper swaddling.

18:44.503 --> 18:45.970
Thank you.

19:02.087 --> 19:04.112
and then when we want to reach him,
all of a sudden, he's unreachable...

19:04.190 --> 19:08.752
- nowhere to be found.
- Maybe he got wind.
Maybe he got spooked.

19:08.828 --> 19:11.729
But I'm beginning to think it doesn't
make a damn bit of difference.

19:11.797 --> 19:15.563
You told me that he told you
he knew how to stop Billy Miles.

19:15.634 --> 19:18.068
Are you telling me now
that you think he's a liar?

19:18.137 --> 19:21.903
He is or he isn't. What the hell
difference does it really make?

19:21.974 --> 19:23.908
It doesn't make
any difference at all...

19:23.976 --> 19:27.002
unless you wanna protect
Scully and that baby.

19:27.046 --> 19:29.674
And then what?

19:31.217 --> 19:34.675
How long can you
keep this up?

19:34.753 --> 19:37.449
How long until the next Billy Miles
rears his head? The next threat?

19:37.523 --> 19:39.923
The next phantom?

19:39.992 --> 19:42.017
Do you ever stop
to ask yourself?

19:43.929 --> 19:47.524
All the sacrifice,
the blood spill.

19:47.600 --> 19:50.228
You've given nearly
a decade of your life.

19:52.838 --> 19:55.238
Where the hell
is it all gonna end?

19:56.942 --> 20:00.673
I don't know.
Maybe it doesn't.

20:04.283 --> 20:08.652
( tires squealing )

20:08.721 --> 20:11.918
- Start the car.
- What?

20:11.991 --> 20:13.959
- Alex Krycek just pulled in.
- ( car engine starts )

20:29.108 --> 20:33.010
What the hell's he doing here?
How did he get security clearance?

20:33.045 --> 20:36.071
Do you recognize
his passenger?

20:37.149 --> 20:40.676
Yeah, it's Knowle Rohrer.

20:53.132 --> 20:55.066
Thank you.

20:56.135 --> 20:58.262
Thank you.

21:01.607 --> 21:05.976
I have to say, with everything
I know you must be feeling...

21:06.045 --> 21:08.912
you look amazingly
beautiful, Dana.

21:14.853 --> 21:16.980
And what about
what you're feeling?

21:19.058 --> 21:22.323
Any vibrations, Agent Reyes?

21:24.129 --> 21:27.758
- I don't know.
- What?

21:28.901 --> 21:30.926
I don't know if I'm
just being paranoid...

21:32.671 --> 21:34.639
but something feels off.

21:37.843 --> 21:39.777
We need some more water.

22:45.844 --> 22:47.812
( gunshot )

22:49.348 --> 22:51.748
( gun cocks )

23:14.406 --> 23:16.966
Go back inside, Dana!

23:19.878 --> 23:22.278
Who is it?

23:24.116 --> 23:26.084
Dana, it's okay.
He's dead.

23:27.853 --> 23:29.787
No, it's not okay.
What do you mean?

23:29.855 --> 23:32.824
Exactly what I said. Now go on inside.
We'll take care of this.

23:32.891 --> 23:35.155
They said that
he couldn't be stopped.

23:35.227 --> 23:39.755
Dana, he's got no vitals.
He's lost too much blood.

23:49.942 --> 23:51.876
Is this the man
you're afraid of?

23:53.812 --> 23:55.507
How did he
find you out here?

23:57.416 --> 23:59.884
I do have to
report this thing.

23:59.952 --> 24:03.251
- No, you can't do that.
- I don't have any real choice.

24:03.322 --> 24:08.316
No, I mean,
I-I just felt a contraction.

24:15.200 --> 24:17.134
Something's happening.

24:19.772 --> 24:24.175
- Where's he going?
- Not to see you, that's for sure.

24:24.243 --> 24:26.177
Who the hell's
he going to see?

24:29.481 --> 24:31.745
You go ahead.
I got Krycek.

24:58.977 --> 25:00.945
( elevator bell dings )

25:23.902 --> 25:25.870
( knocking )

25:37.316 --> 25:39.511
( chattering )

26:16.221 --> 26:18.155
Agent Doggett?

26:19.224 --> 26:21.419
( hangs up phone )

26:21.493 --> 26:24.223
- What are you doing here?
- They let me out of
the hospital tonight.

26:24.296 --> 26:26.662
What are you doing here?

26:26.899 --> 26:29.891
I got Mulder down in the parking
garage watching Alex Krycek.

26:29.968 --> 26:31.902
What the hell
is Krycek doing here?

26:31.970 --> 26:34.530
- That's what I'm trying to figure out.
- ( phone rings )

26:36.408 --> 26:38.968
- Yeah?
- He's here with Agent Crane.

26:39.044 --> 26:42.309
Agent Crane? How the hell
does he know Agent Crane?

26:42.381 --> 26:44.576
That's a damn good question.
He doesn't.

26:44.650 --> 26:48.450
You been wondering who's getting
these guys past security, how
Billy Miles is in the F.B.I.?

26:48.520 --> 26:51.956
Agent Crane is in on this
with your friend, which means
he's in on it with Krycek.

26:52.024 --> 26:55.084
- They've been in on it all along.
- I don't understand. In on what?

26:55.160 --> 26:57.185
Fooling us, Agent Doggett.

26:57.262 --> 27:01.062
Into chasing after Billy Miles.
Into believing we could protect her.

27:01.099 --> 27:03.590
- Scully?
- Yes, they know where she is.

27:03.669 --> 27:06.900
- No, no. Only I know where she is.
- You and Agent Reyes.

27:06.972 --> 27:09.634
You called her from a phone
inside the F.B.I., didn't you?

27:09.708 --> 27:12.006
There's no way Crane
can tap calls in here, Mulder.

27:12.077 --> 27:14.068
He'd have to have access
to the communications system.

27:14.146 --> 27:16.979
- Skinner's here with me.
- Maybe this goes even higher.

27:17.049 --> 27:18.983
Listen to me,
I got to get to Scully.

27:19.051 --> 27:21.315
You gotta tell me where she is,
where you sent her.

27:21.386 --> 27:24.287
Look, we can nail these guys here,
Mulder. We can put an end to it.

27:24.356 --> 27:27.120
No, you listen. You gotta get out
of there. You got no guarantee...

27:27.192 --> 27:30.286
that these guys
aren't alien replacements too.

27:33.632 --> 27:37.295
Northern Georgia. A place called
Democrat Hot Springs.

27:42.174 --> 27:44.233
Mulder!

27:48.580 --> 27:50.514
( cocks gun )

27:52.684 --> 27:54.618
Get out of the car.

28:04.496 --> 28:06.487
Doesn't seem fair now.

28:06.565 --> 28:08.726
Doesn't seem right.

28:10.435 --> 28:12.369
Coming down to this.

28:12.437 --> 28:15.304
What do you know about fair or right,
Krycek? You're a coward.

28:17.509 --> 28:20.171
I could've killed you so many times,
Mulder. You gotta know that.

28:22.114 --> 28:24.582
I'm the one
that kept you alive.

28:27.686 --> 28:30.177
Praying you'd win somehow.

28:30.255 --> 28:32.746
Then there
really is no God.

28:32.991 --> 28:36.483
You think I'm bad,
that I'm a killer.

28:36.561 --> 28:40.156
We wanted the same thing, brother.
That's what you don't understand.

28:41.233 --> 28:43.258
I wanted to stop them.

28:43.335 --> 28:46.702
All you wanted was
to save your own ass.

28:46.738 --> 28:48.729
No.

28:48.807 --> 28:50.741
I tried to stop them.

28:52.577 --> 28:55.603
Tried to kill Scully's baby
to stop them.

28:55.680 --> 28:59.081
It's too late.

28:59.151 --> 29:02.643
The tragedy is that you--
you wouldn't let it go.

29:06.291 --> 29:08.282
That's why I have to do this.

29:08.360 --> 29:11.158
'Cause you know
how deep it goes.

29:11.229 --> 29:14.357
Right into the F.B.I.

29:15.634 --> 29:19.126
You wanna kill me,
Alex, kill me.

29:20.439 --> 29:22.498
Like you killed my father.

29:24.743 --> 29:28.179
Just don't insult me
trying to make me understand.

29:39.491 --> 29:44.485
- ( gunshot )
- ( groaning )

29:48.100 --> 29:50.466
( breathing heavily )

29:57.075 --> 30:00.203
( screaming )

30:16.761 --> 30:18.695
( groaning )

30:26.304 --> 30:28.602
It's gonna take more bullets
than you can...

30:28.673 --> 30:31.233
ever fire
to win this game.

30:32.677 --> 30:35.578
But one bullet...

30:35.647 --> 30:37.774
and I can give you
a thousand lives.

30:44.756 --> 30:46.189
Shoot Mulder.

31:15.954 --> 31:20.152
I'm going to go to the airport. I need
that location from Agent Doggett.

31:24.429 --> 31:27.660
- Skinner, are you with me?
- You just go. I'll get him.

31:32.404 --> 31:34.338
( car engine starts )

31:45.717 --> 31:47.685
( groaning )

31:47.752 --> 31:50.846
They're two minutes apart now.
It's not going to be long.

31:52.490 --> 31:55.482
- How's this?
- That's great.

32:19.351 --> 32:21.581
( elevator bell dings )

32:22.787 --> 32:25.381
Right there!
Both of you!

32:29.361 --> 32:32.330
I'm prepared to use force!

33:02.294 --> 33:04.262
- Come on. Come on!
- Agent Doggett.

33:12.437 --> 33:14.371
Here you go.

33:16.641 --> 33:18.609
Thank you.

33:24.015 --> 33:25.949
Thank you.

33:27.352 --> 33:29.479
- ( screams )
- Move!

33:29.554 --> 33:31.613
Agent Reyes, what?

33:31.690 --> 33:33.624
Move out of here!

33:33.692 --> 33:35.990
What's happening?

33:39.464 --> 33:41.398
Who are you?

33:50.842 --> 33:53.743
This baby will be born.

34:13.732 --> 34:15.699
SCULLY:
Agent Reyes!

34:18.436 --> 34:20.404
The Blazer!

34:24.743 --> 34:26.768
Get Mulder on the phone.

34:29.347 --> 34:31.871
( tires squealing )

34:37.621 --> 34:40.147
( tires squealing )

34:53.170 --> 34:57.733
What's happening?
Huh? What?

34:57.809 --> 35:01.108
- It's okay, Dana.
- What? No!

35:01.146 --> 35:04.673
- It's going to be okay.
- No!

35:04.749 --> 35:09.982
( breathing heavily,
screams )

35:13.425 --> 35:15.450
Get him off!.

35:20.832 --> 35:25.462
- This is my baby!
- You gotta push, Dana!

35:25.537 --> 35:28.131
( grimaces )
Please don't let them take it!

35:38.016 --> 35:40.712
- Come on, Dana. Push!
- God!

35:44.456 --> 35:47.050
SCULLY:
Please don't let this happen.

35:47.091 --> 35:49.821
- Dana, push!
- It's mine!

35:55.700 --> 35:57.531
Hold on!

36:17.489 --> 36:21.585
- ( yelling )
- Harder! Push, Dana!

36:21.659 --> 36:25.220
- Keep breathing, Dana.
Keep breathing.
- Please don't let them take it!

36:25.463 --> 36:28.455
Push! Push!

36:29.968 --> 36:33.995
- Push, Dana, push!
- ( screams )

36:34.072 --> 36:37.269
( baby crying )

36:50.922 --> 36:55.552
( baby continues crying )

36:59.297 --> 37:02.858
Down there.
Get me down there.

37:23.187 --> 37:26.953
Scully. Scully!

37:29.827 --> 37:34.196
Where is she?
Scully!

37:35.867 --> 37:40.065
Where is she?
Scully!

37:41.806 --> 37:45.640
- Where is she? Tell me where she is!
- Mulder!

37:48.012 --> 37:52.210
- How is she?
- She's inside.

37:52.283 --> 37:55.013
She needs to get
to the hospital.

38:01.926 --> 38:05.225
I'm to take
this story seriously?

38:05.296 --> 38:08.732
These incidents
at the F.B.I.

38:08.800 --> 38:11.268
This account
of Agent Scully's birth.

38:11.336 --> 38:14.772
I'm to submit this report
as quality investigative work?

38:14.839 --> 38:17.239
As representative
of actual fact?

38:18.276 --> 38:20.107
I signed
the report there, sir.

38:20.178 --> 38:24.137
Yeah, I see it,John.
And I see her signature here too.

38:25.783 --> 38:28.911
On an X-File.

38:28.987 --> 38:31.581
I'd like to know when you
assigned yourself, Agent Reyes?

38:31.656 --> 38:33.954
Agent Doggett
assigned me, sir.

38:33.992 --> 38:37.155
Agent Doggett cannot just assume
the authority of this office.

38:37.228 --> 38:40.823
I assume it because this office
is under investigation...

38:40.898 --> 38:44.231
for the late-night meeting
between you, Agent Crane...

38:44.302 --> 38:46.770
and an intelligence operative
named Knowle Rohrer.

38:46.838 --> 38:51.036
Both men were presumed dead,
but are now missing.

38:51.109 --> 38:53.976
In actual fact.

39:10.261 --> 39:13.924
You investigate
what I tell you.

39:15.233 --> 39:18.134
And you put me
on the X-Files.

39:18.202 --> 39:20.170
That's what
I'm investigating.

39:52.470 --> 39:55.769
- Get some rest.
- Yeah.

39:55.807 --> 39:58.241
- We didn't hear you come in.
- We were just dropping off gifts.

39:58.309 --> 40:00.903
- We just wanted to--
- See it with your own eyes.

40:00.978 --> 40:04.106
It's incredible, you know?
You arriving in time to save Scully.

40:04.148 --> 40:07.276
- Getting her to a hospital.
- We still don't know how you did it.

40:07.351 --> 40:11.117
Speaking with Agent Doggett,
he said they never reached you
with specific coordinates.

40:12.690 --> 40:14.851
There was a light.

40:14.926 --> 40:17.292
I followed it.

40:17.361 --> 40:19.295
Guess we got
our next headline.

40:33.111 --> 40:35.045
How's everybody doing?

40:40.218 --> 40:42.413
We're doing just fine.

40:52.263 --> 40:54.254
- Hey, now.
- ( baby crying )

40:56.300 --> 40:58.894
- None of that.
- ( baby gurgling )

41:08.112 --> 41:10.342
Hi.

41:15.219 --> 41:17.153
What are you
gonna call him?

41:17.188 --> 41:19.156
William.

41:21.392 --> 41:23.326
After your father.

41:30.268 --> 41:33.169
Well, I don't know.

41:33.204 --> 41:36.435
He's got your coloring
and your eyes...

41:36.507 --> 41:40.944
but he looks suspiciously
like Assistant Director Skinner.

41:50.955 --> 41:53.287
I don't understand, Mulder.

41:56.093 --> 41:58.220
They came to take him
from us.

42:01.098 --> 42:03.225
Why they didn't--

42:06.103 --> 42:08.469
I don't quite understand
that either.

42:08.539 --> 42:11.872
Except that maybe he isn't
what they thought he was.

42:14.612 --> 42:18.412
That doesn't make him any less
of a miracle though, does it?

42:23.621 --> 42:26.385
From the moment
I became pregnant...

42:26.457 --> 42:28.391
I feared the truth...

42:30.261 --> 42:34.197
about how... and why.

42:36.567 --> 42:39.468
And I know
that you feared it too.

42:39.503 --> 42:41.994
I think what we feared
were the possibilities.

42:45.543 --> 42:48.376
The truth we both know.

42:50.481 --> 42:52.415
Which is what?

43:52.076 --> 43:54.912
CHILD:
I made this!

43:54.912 --> 43:56.937
CHILD:
I made this!
