00:18.233 --> 00:19.467
-Officer: You better stop...

00:32.367 --> 00:34.133
-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.167 --> 00:36.233
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.267 --> 00:38.800
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:38.833 --> 00:42.033
in a court of law.

00:42.067 --> 00:44.167
-I like being done
at the end of the day

00:44.200 --> 00:46.467
and feeling like I've
made an impact.

00:46.500 --> 00:48.500
My partner and I
have a saying--

00:48.533 --> 00:49.733
we'll say it all the time--

00:49.767 --> 00:51.467
is "Who's the worst guy
out there

00:51.500 --> 00:53.700
"who's causing the most problems
that we can go hunt today?"

00:53.733 --> 00:55.667
Because I feel like that's

00:55.700 --> 00:59.133
what the people who pay
my salary expect me to do.

00:59.167 --> 01:01.933
So we go out and try and find
the worst guy we can find,

01:01.967 --> 01:03.500
and we try and lock him up.

01:05.167 --> 01:08.933
Uh, we're gonna check out
this Dodge Ram pickup.

01:08.967 --> 01:12.567
Got paper plates on it,
two guys fooling around in it,

01:12.600 --> 01:13.833
just looks fishy to me.

01:20.067 --> 01:21.600
Go ahead and kill the engine.

01:22.933 --> 01:25.067
(radio chatter)

01:26.333 --> 01:28.067
(tires squeal)

01:34.067 --> 01:36.267
Ace Two, he's
driving away northbound

01:36.300 --> 01:37.933
towards Madison.

01:37.967 --> 01:39.300
I'll light him up.

01:39.333 --> 01:42.933
(siren blares)

01:42.967 --> 01:46.267
And eastbound Madison
from Jackson towards Renick.

01:52.067 --> 01:54.833
And taking Renick.

01:54.867 --> 01:56.100
I think he's slowing down

01:56.133 --> 01:57.600
so the passenger can bail
or something.

01:57.633 --> 02:01.667
Passenger's bailing right at
the first bend on Renick.

02:10.867 --> 02:13.533
Okay, he's stopped
but he's not shutting it off.

02:15.300 --> 02:16.933
Shut it off!

02:21.500 --> 02:23.667
All right, Ace Two in pursuit.

02:23.700 --> 02:25.700
Eastbound Renick towards...

02:31.167 --> 02:33.067
Blew the stop,
almost hit a car,

02:33.100 --> 02:34.667
Baptist Court.

02:34.700 --> 02:36.400
Gonna be a dead end here.

02:48.067 --> 02:49.767
Watch out, guys!
Coming back out!

02:49.800 --> 02:51.367
Blew the stop.

02:52.767 --> 02:54.533
Southbound Harrison.

02:54.567 --> 02:56.533
Marked unit, go ahead
and take it

02:56.567 --> 02:58.067
if you can get past him.

02:59.067 --> 03:01.933
Speeds are 60, 70 plus.

03:01.967 --> 03:03.433
Traffic's light.

03:03.467 --> 03:05.433
Oh, that bus.

03:07.667 --> 03:10.367
Blew the stop.
Westbound.

03:15.567 --> 03:18.667
And taking Roseville Road.
Roseville Road northbound.

03:18.700 --> 03:20.267
-(on radio)
Northbound, Roseville Road.

03:25.800 --> 03:28.300
-Still northbound,
passing cars on the shoulder.

03:30.533 --> 03:32.733
All right, Ace Two,
he's 100 plus.

03:32.767 --> 03:35.633
We're past Tacomic,
he's under Elkhorn.

03:35.667 --> 03:37.167
Passing under Elkhorn.

03:38.700 --> 03:42.133
Ace Two, looks like he went
in the driveway

03:42.167 --> 03:43.733
of the Dugout.

03:43.767 --> 03:46.400
Or I'll get you an address,
7031.

03:55.200 --> 03:57.433
And he's behind the business,

03:57.467 --> 03:59.400
going around
trailers and things.

04:07.700 --> 04:11.467
901! 901! 901!
South side of the business!

04:11.500 --> 04:12.900
Argh!

04:19.267 --> 04:21.200
Ace Two,
he just rammed me.

04:21.233 --> 04:23.067
He's going
northbound Roseville Road.

04:23.067 --> 04:24.800
He rammed me,
my car's dead--

04:24.833 --> 04:26.367
Oh, no it's not.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.367
Northbound Roseville Road.

04:33.067 --> 04:34.267
Ace Two, I lost him

04:34.300 --> 04:36.567
somewhere in Gold Run,
Roseville Road area.

04:39.067 --> 04:41.667
-(on radio)
51-53,

04:41.700 --> 04:43.333
I got the vehicle over here.

04:43.367 --> 04:45.200
-Uh, they got him.

04:46.400 --> 04:50.633
-(on radio)
They got him
down on the ground.

04:50.667 --> 04:52.667
-They got him in custody
right down here.

04:52.700 --> 04:55.633
He ran from the car
right up here.

04:55.667 --> 04:57.200
-(on radio)
150 Dream Court.

04:57.233 --> 05:00.633
Nobody here knows that guy,
he just bailed in the driveway.

05:10.933 --> 05:14.067
-He's got no belt on that.

05:14.100 --> 05:15.300
-Sweet.

05:16.467 --> 05:17.567
Hello?

05:17.600 --> 05:19.133
Look at me.

05:20.833 --> 05:22.400
Yeah, that's him.

05:22.433 --> 05:23.733
-That's the one
I was talking about.

05:23.767 --> 05:25.200
-That's him. 100%.

05:25.233 --> 05:26.333
-Yeah.

05:26.367 --> 05:28.333
-So he grabbed the bike,

05:28.367 --> 05:29.767
he took off,
ran from the back,

05:29.800 --> 05:32.067
'cause he threw some stuff back
here, according to witnesses.

05:32.100 --> 05:33.733
-I haven't looked in there yet.
-Okay.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.700
I'll dig through the bag
and stuff.

05:35.733 --> 05:37.367
Any plates on it?

05:37.400 --> 05:39.700
-We have a VIN or anything?
-Uh, no, but we ran the VIN,
it's stolen.

05:39.733 --> 05:40.933
-It is stolen?
-Yeah.

05:40.967 --> 05:42.467
-Sweet.

05:42.500 --> 05:44.400
-I'm with the Sheriff's
department, I'm a detective,
okay?

05:44.433 --> 05:46.133
Have you been arrested before?

05:47.333 --> 05:48.633
You have?

05:48.667 --> 05:50.667
Okay. For what type of stuff?

05:50.700 --> 05:52.567
-Um...

05:54.400 --> 05:57.067
Receiving stolen property, DUI.

05:58.300 --> 05:59.567
-Okay.

05:59.600 --> 06:02.500
-Searching the car,
seeing what else.

06:02.533 --> 06:04.067
We've already got
a syringe and...

06:07.167 --> 06:08.467
giant lighter.

06:09.867 --> 06:12.233
Gonna see
what else is in here.

06:12.267 --> 06:14.167
Got somebody
else's credit cards.

06:16.333 --> 06:17.967
Front end of
my truck's messed up.

06:18.067 --> 06:19.900
Looks like I'm out a bumper...

06:21.200 --> 06:23.500
and a headlight.

06:23.533 --> 06:26.600
Oh, my license plate
reader cameras are under here.

06:31.567 --> 06:32.933
Eh, they survived.

06:37.067 --> 06:38.367
You all right?

06:38.400 --> 06:39.900
Let me see your shoulder.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.267
Just a scrape?

06:41.300 --> 06:42.500
I'll get that treated.

06:42.533 --> 06:45.300
You know you
backed into me, right?

06:45.333 --> 06:47.300
-I'm sorry about that.
I didn't see you at all 'cause--

06:47.333 --> 06:48.767
-You didn't see me?!

06:48.800 --> 06:50.367
-No, because when
I hit the fence

06:50.400 --> 06:52.800
the mirrors on the truck,
they broke off

06:52.833 --> 06:54.200
and I didn't see nothing.

06:54.233 --> 06:56.333
-Dude, you jacked
my truck up, man.

06:56.367 --> 06:58.200
That's not cool.

06:58.233 --> 06:59.567
Right now you're going to jail

06:59.600 --> 07:02.533
for assault with a deadly weapon
on a peace officer.

07:02.567 --> 07:05.233
Vehicle theft, possession
of stolen vehicle,

07:05.267 --> 07:07.100
evading with reckless.

07:08.233 --> 07:09.567
Maybe a few others.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.500
I'd rather you
just stopped next time

07:11.533 --> 07:13.067
and explain it.
We can talk about it.

07:13.067 --> 07:16.067
We can sort things out
without the pursuit, okay?

07:16.067 --> 07:18.167
You're gonna kill somebody.

07:21.067 --> 07:23.700
-Of course, living in Green Bay
I'm an avid Packers fan.

07:23.733 --> 07:26.700
Like watching sports.

07:26.733 --> 07:29.533
I have a great interest
in aviation.

07:29.567 --> 07:32.833
Hope to someday obtain
my pilot's license.

07:32.867 --> 07:35.067
Enjoy camping,

07:35.067 --> 07:37.167
and then spending time
with my family.

07:37.200 --> 07:43.700
Right now we're en route to
a male-female disturbance.

07:43.733 --> 07:46.633
Checking on any injuries
with the female.

07:46.667 --> 07:49.500
The male suspect took off
on foot.

07:53.967 --> 07:55.567
Which way did he run?

07:55.600 --> 07:57.167
-He took off back there.

07:57.200 --> 07:58.667
-My car is over here.

07:58.700 --> 08:00.367
-You got it?
-Yeah.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.067
What's he got on?

08:02.100 --> 08:03.667
-White shorts.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.133
And a shirt.
-The officer is here
with her.

08:05.167 --> 08:07.067
-I just want to go home.

08:07.067 --> 08:08.767
-White shorts...

08:08.800 --> 08:10.400
and what?
-A black shirt.

08:10.433 --> 08:11.500
-Black shirt.

08:11.533 --> 08:13.833
Okay. And who is the guy
in relation to you?

08:13.867 --> 08:15.067
-My boyfriend.

08:15.067 --> 08:16.233
-Your boyfriend. Okay.

08:16.267 --> 08:18.567
What do you want done?

08:18.600 --> 08:19.800
-I don't know.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.400
He just has a tantrum.

08:22.433 --> 08:24.067
He just had a tantrum.
-Okay.

08:24.067 --> 08:26.900
-I don't want to get him
in trouble.

08:26.933 --> 08:28.300
-Take a breath, okay?

08:28.333 --> 08:31.067
He cannot do that to you.

08:31.067 --> 08:35.067
And we're not gonna tolerate
that kind of behavior
from a man. Okay?

08:35.100 --> 08:37.833
-You can put him in jail
for a night, I don't care.

08:37.867 --> 08:39.933
I don't wanna be
around him right now.

08:39.967 --> 08:44.667
-Well, you gotta be willing
to press charges against him.

08:44.700 --> 08:46.400
-You don't need to be afraid.

08:47.433 --> 08:49.067
-Ma'am, what happened?

08:49.067 --> 08:50.700
-You don't need to be
afraid, hon.
-We were arguing

08:50.733 --> 08:52.267
because our car got towed.

08:52.300 --> 08:54.733
I'm always
paying for everything.

08:54.767 --> 08:56.533
So I told him I was done.

08:56.567 --> 08:58.733
And then he threw a tantrum
and took my phone,

08:58.767 --> 09:01.100
took my purse, wanted me
to follow him.

09:01.133 --> 09:02.900
-Okay, you got
your phone back, all right?

09:02.933 --> 09:05.233
-And I told him I wasn't
going anywhere with him

09:05.267 --> 09:08.433
because when he's--
when we fight, he gets physical.

09:08.467 --> 09:10.100
Like, he'll pull me
by my arm.

09:11.433 --> 09:13.700
And so I told him I wasn't
gonna go back with him

09:13.733 --> 09:15.867
and I started heading
to my own house.

09:15.900 --> 09:17.700
He's like,
"Don't you want your purse?"

09:17.733 --> 09:19.200
I was like,
"Yes, give it to me."

09:19.233 --> 09:20.567
He's like,
"I guess you don't want it."

09:20.600 --> 09:21.900
So he started
heading back that way

09:21.933 --> 09:23.600
and then I just continued
walking this way.

09:23.633 --> 09:25.567
And then he came from
behind me,

09:25.600 --> 09:29.167
choked me, and then punched me
twice in the face.

09:30.800 --> 09:34.333
He said he wouldn't
hit me anymore.

09:34.367 --> 09:36.767
-Edward Three,
is he in custody?

09:36.800 --> 09:40.467
All right. So the other
officer's have him, okay?

09:40.500 --> 09:41.933
-I was passing by.
-Okay.

09:41.967 --> 09:43.633
-Well, I saw
the confrontation.

09:43.667 --> 09:45.067
I did see him walk this way,

09:45.067 --> 09:47.167
but he turned around,
he came up behind her,

09:47.200 --> 09:49.233
and pushed her,
and then I saw him hit her

09:49.267 --> 09:50.667
as I got closer.

09:50.700 --> 09:52.667
And she was down on the ground.

09:52.700 --> 09:55.167
-So when he pushed her
she fell?

09:55.200 --> 09:56.200
-Yes.
-Okay.

09:56.233 --> 09:57.700
And than what?

09:57.733 --> 09:59.067
-He punched her in the face.

09:59.067 --> 10:01.367
Then I saw him over her,
screaming at her,

10:01.400 --> 10:03.300
and then I saw him
take off this way.

10:03.333 --> 10:05.033
-Okay. Run to the south?

10:05.067 --> 10:06.333
-Yes, yes.
-Okay.

10:06.367 --> 10:09.500
-And I tried to remember
the description of him.
-Okay.

10:09.533 --> 10:11.733
Ma'am, do you need
a rescue squad?

10:11.767 --> 10:13.500
What do you got?
You got the scrape here,

10:13.533 --> 10:14.933
you got the scratch
on your face.

10:14.967 --> 10:16.300
Let's see your neck.

10:19.367 --> 10:21.333
Where did he get you
on your neck?

10:21.367 --> 10:24.800
-Right here. He was choking me
with his inner arm.

10:24.833 --> 10:26.900
-And did that cause you pain?

10:26.933 --> 10:28.667
Okay.

10:28.700 --> 10:30.033
And, uh...

10:30.067 --> 10:31.967
-I couldn't breathe.
-And you couldn't breathe.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.700
This officer here has
the male in custody.

10:34.733 --> 10:36.100
We're gonna talk to him.

10:36.133 --> 10:37.633
-I still love your ass, woman!

10:37.667 --> 10:39.933
-The other citizen
that saw this

10:39.967 --> 10:42.333
saw them arguing
back at McDonald's--

10:42.367 --> 10:44.100
that followed them.

10:44.133 --> 10:46.333
-I didn't want to hurt you!

10:47.367 --> 10:49.933
-(bleep) (bleep) sucks!

10:49.967 --> 10:52.267
-You wanna talk to him,
I'll go see what she'll tell me.

10:54.333 --> 10:56.500
-So what happened, man?

10:56.533 --> 10:58.367
-What really happened is that

10:58.400 --> 11:00.400
both of us are just heated.

11:00.433 --> 11:01.900
She just got off of work,

11:01.933 --> 11:04.067
I get my car towed away.

11:04.067 --> 11:06.233
-Yeah, she mentioned that.
What happened there?

11:06.267 --> 11:07.733
What'd it get towed for?

11:07.767 --> 11:09.933
-Because I don't
have my license.

11:09.967 --> 11:11.300
I lost it.

11:11.333 --> 11:12.933
-So, what happened?

11:14.867 --> 11:17.667
-We were fighting back
and forth in McDonald's.

11:17.700 --> 11:19.300
She didn't want to talk to me.

11:19.333 --> 11:20.833
-And when you say
"fighting back and forth,"

11:20.867 --> 11:22.133
do you mean--
-Like, just arguing.

11:22.167 --> 11:24.467
-Arguing?
-Speaking mouth-wise
and (bleep).

11:24.500 --> 11:26.500
And she just was like,

11:26.533 --> 11:30.500
"Leave me alone. I just want
to be left alone for the day,"

11:30.533 --> 11:31.633
and whatnot.

11:31.667 --> 11:34.067
And I was like,
"Just let me get a kiss,

11:34.067 --> 11:35.533
"then I'll go."

11:35.567 --> 11:37.967
And then I, pretty much
being an ass (bleep),

11:38.067 --> 11:40.267
took her phone,
then took her purse,

11:40.300 --> 11:44.100
and kind of pretty much played
a bit of games and (bleep).

11:44.133 --> 11:45.300
I should have just let--

11:45.333 --> 11:47.333
You know, got a kiss,
went home,

11:47.367 --> 11:49.167
this (bleep) wouldn't
have happened.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.800
For a man--
I can say this--

11:50.833 --> 11:53.500
I'm not a man,
I'm a bitch.

11:53.533 --> 11:55.533
Because you don't do that
(bleep) to a woman.

11:55.567 --> 11:57.700
You don't never hit a woman.

11:57.733 --> 12:00.267
And I should have
just left her be.

12:00.300 --> 12:01.300
-Okay.

12:01.333 --> 12:03.067
-And at least
I can admit it, man.

12:03.067 --> 12:04.733
I (bleep) love her.

12:04.767 --> 12:08.667
-Did you--
So you did hit her?

12:08.700 --> 12:10.967
-If you give me your hand,
I won't do nothing.

12:11.067 --> 12:14.067
I just pretty much
wrapped my hand like this
around her,

12:14.100 --> 12:15.733
and drug her to the ground.

12:15.767 --> 12:16.900
-Okay.

12:16.933 --> 12:18.633
Where did you wrap
your hand around her?

12:18.667 --> 12:19.800
-Her neck.

12:19.833 --> 12:20.967
-Around her neck.

12:21.067 --> 12:23.067
Okay. And you brought her
down to the ground then.

12:23.100 --> 12:24.333
-Yes.

12:24.367 --> 12:26.200
-And you hit her when
she was on the ground?

12:26.233 --> 12:27.400
-Yes.
-How many times?

12:27.433 --> 12:28.500
-Twice.
-Twice.

12:28.533 --> 12:30.800
-Where'd you hit her?
-I guess, her face.

12:30.833 --> 12:31.933
-Her face?

12:31.967 --> 12:33.767
Closed fist? Did you slap her
or punch her?

12:33.800 --> 12:35.133
-I slapped her.

12:35.167 --> 12:38.067
I was-- I'm pissed--
I was pissed.

12:38.067 --> 12:39.500
-Okay.

12:39.533 --> 12:41.933
The witnesses here stop,

12:41.967 --> 12:43.767
and that's when you
took off running?
-Yup. Yup.

12:45.533 --> 12:47.167
-All right.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.133
Do you understand when you
put your arm around her

12:49.167 --> 12:51.500
you choked her
and she couldn't breathe?

12:51.533 --> 12:53.433
-I should have just
(bleep) gone home.

12:53.467 --> 12:55.333
Just left her be.

12:56.967 --> 12:58.467
-Based on your confession,

12:58.500 --> 13:00.533
there's gonna be
multiple charges.

13:00.567 --> 13:03.433
The worst is gonna be--
it's a strangulation charge,

13:03.467 --> 13:05.467
which is gonna be a felony
'cause she couldn't breathe.

13:05.500 --> 13:06.700
Okay?

13:06.733 --> 13:08.167
Do you guys live together?

13:08.200 --> 13:09.767
-Yeah, we do.
-Okay.

13:09.800 --> 13:12.567
Based on that it's
domestic violence.

13:12.600 --> 13:15.167
-I know it is, dude.

13:15.200 --> 13:20.100
I know that I'm probably never
ever gonna do it again.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.067
Nor will I ever
get to see her again.

13:26.067 --> 13:28.933
-I've been here for about five,
six years now. I went
to college here.

13:28.967 --> 13:33.367
I would say that Green Bay
itself is a very hometown...

13:33.400 --> 13:36.433
very Midwest feeling.
Good hospitality.

13:36.467 --> 13:38.533
But we're starting to get
the big city feeling

13:38.567 --> 13:40.233
as far as our policing goes.

13:40.267 --> 13:41.933
And we've had to adapt
to that a little bit

13:41.967 --> 13:43.533
the last couple years.

13:45.267 --> 13:47.100
We're responding to
a retail theft.

13:47.133 --> 13:49.600
A local department store
down the road.

13:49.633 --> 13:52.167
We got a female that's
in the store right now

13:52.200 --> 13:55.067
concealing numerous
pieces of merchandise.

13:55.067 --> 13:58.067
Loss preventions is kinda
tailing her through the store
right now

13:58.100 --> 13:59.333
waiting for her to leave.

13:59.367 --> 14:01.500
We can see if we can kinda
trap her at the door.

14:01.533 --> 14:04.333
The female,
white, gray tank top.

14:04.367 --> 14:06.267
We're gonna stop her
on the way out.

14:10.833 --> 14:12.133
Hey, ma'am.

14:12.167 --> 14:14.567
Ma'am, can you
stop for me, please.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.133
-What?

14:16.167 --> 14:18.067
-Hey, we got a call
about a shoplifter in the store.

14:18.100 --> 14:19.900
-Shopko loss prevention.

14:19.933 --> 14:21.567
You need to come back
inside with me.

14:21.600 --> 14:23.933
-What?
-Some concealed merchandise.

14:23.967 --> 14:25.367
Just go back in the loss
prevention office,

14:25.400 --> 14:26.933
we'll meet you back there
and talk about it.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.333
-Okay.

14:30.500 --> 14:31.667
-Mind if the cameras come?

14:31.700 --> 14:33.433
-Oh, that's fine.

14:33.467 --> 14:34.867
-If it's okay with...
-It's no problem.

14:43.533 --> 14:45.067
-When we get in the office,
I'm gonna ask you

14:45.067 --> 14:46.533
to put all the unpaid
merchandise on my desk.

14:50.067 --> 14:51.267
You go and have a seat,

14:51.300 --> 14:53.933
and put all unpaid merchandise
up here that you have.

14:53.967 --> 14:55.767
-What do you have
for concealing it?

14:55.800 --> 14:57.500
-I know she has a ring,
for sure in that one.

14:57.533 --> 14:58.867
Probably two, for sure.

15:00.367 --> 15:01.867
-Where would she
have that at?

15:01.900 --> 15:02.967
-Right here.

15:03.067 --> 15:04.333
-Okay.
-And it's not a ring.

15:05.700 --> 15:08.267
-Okay. Well, the truth of
the matter is it's not yours.

15:08.300 --> 15:10.067
It's not paid for.
-What else do you have?

15:11.267 --> 15:13.500
-Well, she didn't ring that up.

15:13.533 --> 15:14.633
I don't think.

15:14.667 --> 15:17.567
Where's the receipt?

15:17.600 --> 15:20.100
-What about in the purse?
You have any jewelry?

15:20.133 --> 15:21.667
Unpaid items in your purse?

15:21.700 --> 15:22.900
-Probably not.

15:22.933 --> 15:24.267
-Just have a seat.
I'll go through it.

15:24.300 --> 15:25.900
I don't need-- I don't
need you to go through it.

15:25.933 --> 15:27.967
Ma'am, just give me the purse.
Just sit down.

15:28.067 --> 15:29.733
-I'm giving her this.

15:29.767 --> 15:31.233
-Okay. That's fine.
Have a seat.

15:38.067 --> 15:39.400
Is this all yours, too?

15:40.567 --> 15:41.567
-Yup.

15:43.133 --> 15:44.333
-No, it's not.

15:44.367 --> 15:46.200
-This isn't?
So this is from somewhere else?

15:46.233 --> 15:47.767
-I bought it at Shopko...

15:47.800 --> 15:49.400
-You have a receipt for this?
On you?

15:49.433 --> 15:52.067
-Not on me. I can get it
for you if you'd like.

15:52.067 --> 15:54.300
-Well, hang on to that until
she shows me a receipt.

15:54.333 --> 15:55.700
Do you know where
the other earrings are?

15:55.733 --> 15:57.067
These don't match.

15:57.067 --> 15:58.433
These are two different ones.

15:58.467 --> 16:00.700
-I didn't take both earrings.

16:01.833 --> 16:03.067
-I saw her on camera.

16:03.100 --> 16:04.700
I have her on camera.
I'll go back and watch it

16:04.733 --> 16:07.467
and find out exactly where
the packaging is.

16:07.500 --> 16:11.200
-So, my question is
am I going to jail?

16:11.233 --> 16:13.900
-Well, we'll have
to verify that.

16:13.933 --> 16:15.467
You ever stolen before?

16:17.067 --> 16:18.900
-Way a long time ago.

16:18.933 --> 16:20.233
-How many times?

16:20.267 --> 16:21.600
-Once.

16:21.633 --> 16:23.100
-Got a couple different pills
in here.

16:23.133 --> 16:24.633
What are these for?

16:24.667 --> 16:26.533
-Huh?
-What are these pills for
in here?

16:26.567 --> 16:28.600
-My muscle relaxers that
I'm prescribed to.

16:28.633 --> 16:30.300
-Where's your
prescription at?

16:30.333 --> 16:31.833
-'Cause I don't carry--

16:31.867 --> 16:34.367
I don't like to carry
my whole bottle around.

16:34.400 --> 16:37.533
-You know it's illegal not
to carry your bottle around
but carry pills around?

16:37.567 --> 16:39.467
-You're supposed to keep it
in your prescription bottle.

16:39.500 --> 16:41.167
-But I got 'em--
-What are these ones right here?

16:41.200 --> 16:43.400
-Those are my alprazolam.

16:43.433 --> 16:45.967
Do you want to see
my prescriptions?

16:46.067 --> 16:48.300
-Sure. Why don't you bring them
outside and talk to me.

16:55.133 --> 16:56.267
You got 'em?

16:57.700 --> 16:59.400
Courtney, what are you
doing today? Come on.

16:59.433 --> 17:01.767
-What am I doing?
-What are you doing
here today?

17:01.800 --> 17:03.633
-Well, I was doing shopping.

17:04.733 --> 17:06.367
-I don't know.
-What happened then?

17:07.433 --> 17:09.733
-I guess I...

17:09.767 --> 17:11.367
-You don't have
any criminal history,

17:11.400 --> 17:12.833
-I know.
-You're young...

17:14.067 --> 17:15.567
and you're in here
shoplifting today.

17:17.233 --> 17:18.833
-I can't answer that

17:18.867 --> 17:20.800
because I made
a stupid decision.

17:20.833 --> 17:22.133
-Okay.

17:22.167 --> 17:24.400
-I know young people
make dumb mistakes and stuff,

17:24.433 --> 17:26.067
but as far as it went today,

17:26.067 --> 17:27.700
you're continuing
to lie about it to us.

17:27.733 --> 17:29.100
That's the part
that kind of sucks.

17:29.133 --> 17:30.767
You know, just be honest
and forthcoming

17:30.800 --> 17:31.967
about what you're
doing here today,

17:32.067 --> 17:33.433
what you stole
and what you didn't steal.

17:33.467 --> 17:35.567
-Well, I didn't
come here to steal.
-I understand that.

17:35.600 --> 17:38.733
But I understand that you
probably didn't go to another
store today and steal either.

17:38.767 --> 17:40.467
You probably came here,
and you stole.

17:40.500 --> 17:43.067
Okay? So all that merchandise
in there that you said you
bought at another store,

17:43.067 --> 17:44.833
it's probably from here, okay?

17:44.867 --> 17:47.167
-No, not all of it.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.100
-Let's just make it easier
on her in there

17:49.133 --> 17:50.933
trying to track
all this stuff down,

17:50.967 --> 17:53.767
and just tell her the truth
and what you did and what
you didn't do, okay?

17:53.800 --> 17:55.333
We'll get you out of here
a lot faster

17:55.367 --> 17:56.633
if we do it that way, okay?

17:56.667 --> 17:58.067
-All right.
-All right.

17:58.067 --> 17:59.767
-I appreciate it.
-Start making the right
decisions, okay?

17:59.800 --> 18:02.333
It's not too late
to make a good decision, right?

18:02.367 --> 18:04.467
Okay. Go sit down in there.

18:04.500 --> 18:05.833
All right? And just
be honest with her

18:05.867 --> 18:07.467
and tell her what's
going on, okay?
-Okay.

18:07.500 --> 18:09.767
-'Cause I don't feel like
you've been that way so far.

18:19.967 --> 18:22.067
Do you have anything more
than this on camera?

18:22.067 --> 18:24.500
Or are we good to go?

18:24.533 --> 18:26.933
-Um, I think that's
about it for right now.

18:26.967 --> 18:28.533
-10-4.

18:29.600 --> 18:30.600
There she is.

18:30.633 --> 18:31.800
-Oh.

18:31.833 --> 18:35.333
Yeah, I have her on a couple
different views, so...

18:35.367 --> 18:37.267
Here's one or two.

18:42.867 --> 18:45.700
-Are we gonna see her conceal
in her pockets

18:45.733 --> 18:47.100
and her purse then?

18:47.133 --> 18:48.900
-Um, possibly.
I don't know.

18:48.933 --> 18:50.400
I might have to back it up
a little farther

18:50.433 --> 18:52.333
'cause I believe she already
has the ring over there

18:52.367 --> 18:53.433
already in her hand.

18:54.733 --> 18:56.567
So, unfortunately...

18:58.533 --> 18:59.533
Okay.

18:59.567 --> 19:01.167
-She's got something
in her hand.

19:01.200 --> 19:03.267
-I'm gonna
charge her for it 'cause
she doesn't have a receipt

19:03.300 --> 19:04.300
and then it is ours.

19:04.333 --> 19:05.767
She had it concealed
in her purse.

19:05.800 --> 19:07.433
She was all over the store,
I know that

19:07.467 --> 19:09.067
because of all the other items
she had.

19:09.100 --> 19:10.800
I picked her up here

19:10.833 --> 19:12.567
because she was here
for a while.

19:12.600 --> 19:14.833
I did pick her up earlier,
but she really wasn't
doing anything.

19:14.867 --> 19:16.333
She was back by toilet
paper and that.

19:16.367 --> 19:18.833
But this is always, you know,
high theft area, so of course--

19:18.867 --> 19:19.900
-Easy to conceal.

19:19.933 --> 19:21.133
-Exactly.

19:21.167 --> 19:22.867
-Okay, we're gonna take
you down to the station.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.867
We're gonna process you
for retail theft,

19:24.900 --> 19:26.967
which means we gotta do
fingerprinting, we gotta
do photos.

19:27.067 --> 19:29.067
We're not gonna put you in
handcuffs or anything like that.

19:29.067 --> 19:31.733
You've been decent with us
the last couple minutes

19:31.767 --> 19:33.100
we've been dealing
with you, okay?

19:33.133 --> 19:34.433
But we do need you
to go down there.

19:34.467 --> 19:36.733
-I can't. I have no one
to pick me up.

19:36.767 --> 19:38.067
Well, we're gonna have
to work on that.

19:38.100 --> 19:39.100
That was your
decision, okay?

19:39.133 --> 19:40.333
You're not going to jail.

19:40.367 --> 19:42.333
You just made
a bad decision today.

19:42.367 --> 19:44.367
You got plenty of time to make
the decision better, okay?

19:44.400 --> 19:45.833
As far as the medication goes,

19:45.867 --> 19:47.833
I'm just gonna give you
the benefit of the doubt
tonight, okay?

19:47.867 --> 19:48.867
Gather up your stuff.

19:50.067 --> 19:51.933
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:51.967 --> 19:53.900
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:53.933 --> 19:55.067
Cover is code three.

19:55.100 --> 19:58.067
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:04.067 --> 20:06.033
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:06.067 --> 20:07.233
