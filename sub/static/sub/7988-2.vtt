00:06.340 --> 00:09.389
(crow sawing)

00:11.386 --> 00:16.142
(bell tolling)

00:17.184 --> 00:18.481
Hey!

00:21.939 --> 00:23.031
Hey, wait!

00:25.000 --> 00:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here

00:43.585 --> 00:45.132
I'm alive!

00:48.006 --> 00:49.098
I'm alive!

00:51.051 --> 00:52.303
Can you hear me?

00:52.469 --> 00:53.561
I'm alive!

00:55.764 --> 00:56.856
I'm alive!

01:14.324 --> 01:15.871
(groans)

01:21.373 --> 01:23.125
I'm alive.

02:00.287 --> 02:02.540
(seagulls calling)

02:07.461 --> 02:08.804
I'll raise you.

02:14.259 --> 02:15.431
Your turn.

02:17.596 --> 02:18.813
I'm out.

02:19.931 --> 02:20.773
Grandpa!

02:22.601 --> 02:25.104
Would you ask Mother
for some tea, Tatiana?

02:25.270 --> 02:26.738
Thank you, darling.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.149
Of course, Grandma.

02:28.315 --> 02:30.738
It's so quiet here.

02:30.901 --> 02:33.245
I never noticed before.

02:33.403 --> 02:36.532
You never sat still
long enough to listen.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.996
You will get better.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.877
But it'll take some time.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.424
You got another chance, Harry.

02:45.582 --> 02:46.629
Make the most of it.

02:58.553 --> 02:59.554
Mr. Selfridge?

02:59.721 --> 03:00.597
<i>London Herald.</i>

03:02.933 --> 03:03.934
How is your father?

03:04.101 --> 03:06.399
On the mend, thank you.

03:06.561 --> 03:07.608
It was a terrible fall.

03:07.771 --> 03:10.741
When will he be back?

03:10.899 --> 03:13.197
Well, the Selfridge business
is in safe hands.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.704
I've been a managing director
for a few years now.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.489
Well, of course,
you're son and heir.

03:17.656 --> 03:20.159
So you're looking
after the store now?

03:20.325 --> 03:21.793
It's all being taken care of.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.888
Madame Rennard,
you have a budget.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.398
GROVE: You want six machinists,
quality materials,

03:43.557 --> 03:46.151
two new <i>sales</i> staff

03:46.309 --> 03:47.606
and a designer.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.271
Who's very expensive.

03:49.438 --> 03:50.530
He's French.

03:52.774 --> 03:53.866
I wish Harry was here.

03:54.025 --> 03:56.198
The Chief would say
this is a business.

03:56.361 --> 03:57.829
We have to make a profit.

03:57.988 --> 03:58.910
Right.

03:59.072 --> 04:03.122
Well, I shall just
design it myself then.

04:03.285 --> 04:04.252
My line.

04:04.411 --> 04:05.503
My ideas.

04:08.039 --> 04:10.087
We would save money.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.376
But I'll need
the right team behind me.

04:11.543 --> 04:15.514
I want carte blanche to hire
whoever I need.

04:16.505 --> 04:18.382
Within the budget.

04:19.551 --> 04:20.517
Oh, very well.

04:22.721 --> 04:24.189
Gentlemen.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.320
You're looking tired.

04:31.480 --> 04:32.982
I'm exhausted.

04:33.148 --> 04:34.400
You're doing two jobs.

04:34.566 --> 04:37.410
Chief of staff
and deputy manager.

04:37.569 --> 04:40.288
No one knows when
the Chief will be back.

04:40.447 --> 04:44.327
Still, at least
Meryl's started working.

04:44.493 --> 04:46.211
One less thing to worry about.

04:48.580 --> 04:49.923
There's a customer

04:50.081 --> 04:51.333
wants a <i>dress</i> fitting.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.843
You need training first.

04:53.001 --> 04:55.129
You've been saying that
all week.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.389
Connie Hawkins!

04:57.547 --> 04:58.844
Sarah Ellis!

05:02.594 --> 05:04.767
It's Connie Towler now.

05:04.930 --> 05:06.773
You and George?

05:08.475 --> 05:09.852
What you doing here?

05:10.018 --> 05:11.065
I've got an interview.

05:11.228 --> 05:12.855
Head of the
sewing machine room.

05:13.021 --> 05:13.897
Oh, well.

05:14.064 --> 05:14.906
Good luck.

05:28.870 --> 05:29.996
Morning.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.336
Morning.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.718
As you were, ladies,
do carry on.

05:46.763 --> 05:47.639
(whispering):
What is she doing here?

05:47.806 --> 05:49.183
I have no idea.

05:58.066 --> 06:00.114
(dog barking)

06:20.547 --> 06:21.639
Gordon.

06:23.508 --> 06:24.555
Pa.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.846
Grace.

06:27.012 --> 06:27.683
You're looking better.

06:27.846 --> 06:29.689
Thank you for coming.

06:29.848 --> 06:33.102
We haven't sat down as
a family for a long time.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.776
Ah, Violette.

06:40.942 --> 06:42.489
She flew in from Paris.

06:42.652 --> 06:43.528
In her own plane.

06:44.738 --> 06:45.409
Pa.

06:47.824 --> 06:50.543
Gordon, congratulations.

06:50.702 --> 06:53.000
"Young Gordon Selfridge

06:53.163 --> 06:57.088
"is poised to take the reins
from his ailing father.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.423
"Harry Selfridge was lucky
to survive the fall,

06:59.586 --> 07:01.213
but his health is understood
to be fragile."

07:01.379 --> 07:04.007
Someone could have told me.

07:04.174 --> 07:06.302
Well... it's nonsense.

07:06.468 --> 07:08.516
"Fresh blood may be
what's needed

07:08.678 --> 07:10.351
"to invigorate the
Selfridge empire.

07:10.513 --> 07:12.607
"Harry Selfridge is
a phenomenon,

07:12.766 --> 07:14.689
but are his best days
behind him?"

07:14.851 --> 07:16.524
I never said that.

07:16.686 --> 07:18.939
What did you say?

07:19.105 --> 07:22.575
Just... just that...

07:22.734 --> 07:24.452
that it was all being
taken care of.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.326
What's all this
about, then?

07:27.489 --> 07:28.741
It's guesswork.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.707
It's just what people
might be thinking.

07:32.869 --> 07:33.586
That I'm past it?

07:33.745 --> 07:35.668
No, that...

07:35.830 --> 07:37.002
...some people
when they get older

07:37.165 --> 07:37.791
take a step back.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.084
It's a family business.

07:39.250 --> 07:40.752
I'm your son...

07:40.919 --> 07:41.636
I'm not taking
a step back!

07:41.795 --> 07:43.593
The store needs me at the helm

07:43.755 --> 07:46.099
and I will not be
pushed aside.

07:46.257 --> 07:47.349
Harry, please.

07:47.509 --> 07:48.726
Gordon thinks
the world of you.

07:48.885 --> 07:50.387
He'd never do anything you
didn't want him to.

07:52.347 --> 07:55.647
I'm going to talk to Wynnstay
about his press coverage.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.061
I should call the store.

07:57.227 --> 07:58.479
I'll do it.
No, I'll do it!

07:58.645 --> 07:59.521
You're supposed to be resting.

07:59.688 --> 08:01.736
Don't tell me what to do!

08:04.401 --> 08:05.277
I can manage.

08:10.573 --> 08:11.825
I was just trying to help.

08:11.992 --> 08:15.121
Grace, come on, we're leavin .

08:15.286 --> 08:16.162
Gordon, don't...

08:16.329 --> 08:18.127
GRACE:
Gordon, please...

08:18.289 --> 08:20.007
It's good to keep
family tradition going.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.669
I've been here long enough.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.635
Tomorrow I'm going back to
London to sort all this out.

08:42.313 --> 08:43.438
Mr. Selfridge,
how are you?

08:43.606 --> 08:45.108
Good.

08:45.275 --> 08:46.868
What about your plans
to retire?

08:47.027 --> 08:48.779
You've been running
Selfridges for 20 years.

08:48.945 --> 08:50.197
REPORTER: Are you going to
stay head of the store?

08:50.363 --> 08:53.367
I plan to go on and on and on.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.500
Thank you.

09:23.605 --> 09:25.073
(clears his throat)

09:25.231 --> 09:26.448
Hello.

09:26.608 --> 09:28.076
Harry!

09:29.444 --> 09:30.320
Oh...!
(Harry groans)

09:30.487 --> 09:31.534
Oh sorry, sorry.

09:31.696 --> 09:33.164
How are you?
Never better.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.701
Now I've got lots of plans
for your fashion launch.

09:35.867 --> 09:36.743
Yes.

09:36.910 --> 09:37.752
The Dolly sisters.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.379
They could model for you.

09:39.537 --> 09:42.586
No, Harry, they're
much too wild.

09:42.749 --> 09:43.625
No, they're beautiful.

09:43.792 --> 09:44.759
The press love them.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.295
I'll call them today.

09:46.461 --> 09:47.929
No, we need English Rose;
she'd be perfect.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.340
Trust me.

09:49.506 --> 09:51.508
This will be...

09:56.387 --> 09:57.889
(sighs)
Great.

10:02.977 --> 10:05.446
Selfridges!

10:05.605 --> 10:08.529
Next stop, Bond Street.

10:08.691 --> 10:10.068
Hold tight, please!

10:34.175 --> 10:35.222
Can I help you?

10:35.385 --> 10:37.387
I've got an interview.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.022
For the position of machinist.

10:39.180 --> 10:41.274
Then you should have gone
to the staff entrance.

10:41.432 --> 10:44.402
Back onto Oxford Street
and round the corner.

10:46.396 --> 10:47.443
Thank you.

10:55.280 --> 10:56.657
May I help you?

10:56.823 --> 10:59.246
Oh... please.

10:59.409 --> 11:03.039
Yellow suits a more
youthful complexion.

11:03.204 --> 11:05.627
And the shape
is very modern.

11:05.790 --> 11:08.919
You'll want something
with a lot more... support.

11:09.085 --> 11:11.338
I beg your pardon!

11:11.504 --> 11:12.721
I just meant...

11:12.881 --> 11:15.134
you want to be comfortable.

11:15.300 --> 11:16.893
At your age.

11:17.051 --> 11:18.223
You're so rude!

11:22.932 --> 11:25.185
Lord Wynnstay.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.524
Ah, he lives!

11:27.687 --> 11:28.779
Exactly--
I'm not retiring.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.690
Not nearly.

11:30.857 --> 11:32.985
I don't want to see
that story again.

11:33.151 --> 11:34.869
Well, try not to fall off
anything else.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.577
If you must, let me know
in advance.

11:37.739 --> 11:39.286
I'll hold the front page.

11:41.075 --> 11:43.453
Now, did you just come here
to tell me off?

11:47.457 --> 11:49.835
You didn't say what you're going
to be doing

11:50.001 --> 11:51.378
about that Serge story.

11:52.921 --> 11:54.764
No, I didn't.

11:56.883 --> 11:59.011
I'd say
it's not worth it.

11:59.177 --> 12:02.397
I want five full-page ads
in all your papers.

12:02.555 --> 12:03.397
We're advertising

12:03.556 --> 12:04.728
a major new launch.

12:04.891 --> 12:05.892
I'd say that's worth more

12:06.059 --> 12:06.981
than a bit of gossip.

12:07.143 --> 12:08.019
What are you up to?

12:08.186 --> 12:10.814
Wait and see.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.074
You won't be able
to write me off again.

12:23.743 --> 12:27.748
(women conversing quietly)

12:31.209 --> 12:32.381
Next?

12:43.096 --> 12:44.313
Take a seat.

12:48.643 --> 12:51.487
Matilda Brockless.

12:51.646 --> 12:54.240
Currently employed
at Furleys,

12:54.399 --> 12:56.322
in Commercial Road.

12:56.484 --> 12:58.737
They're a ladies' tailors.

12:58.903 --> 13:00.530
I take in work, too.

13:00.697 --> 13:02.745
Machine and hand sewing.

13:02.907 --> 13:04.329
What did you do before that?

13:04.492 --> 13:06.745
You've only been there
two years.

13:06.911 --> 13:08.709
I worked at Corleys.

13:08.871 --> 13:09.918
Also as a machinist.

13:10.081 --> 13:11.378
References?

13:11.541 --> 13:13.635
I thought I only needed
current employer.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.090
Character references.

13:15.253 --> 13:16.095
Can you get them?

13:24.887 --> 13:26.059
All right.

13:26.222 --> 13:27.189
Thank you.

13:30.977 --> 13:33.856
MAE: Did you make
that dress yourself?

13:34.022 --> 13:36.070
Yes.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.698
Where did you find
the pattern?

13:39.861 --> 13:41.955
I didn't.

13:42.113 --> 13:43.410
I saw the dress
in a magazine.

13:43.573 --> 13:46.497
Ah... was it Chanel?

13:46.659 --> 13:49.003
Yes.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.711
I had to make
the skirt longer.

13:51.873 --> 13:54.717
Change the neckline,
and longer sleeves...

13:54.876 --> 13:56.378
Mmm, yes, it's very good.

13:57.545 --> 13:58.888
I think Miss Brockless
has got it.

14:01.966 --> 14:04.060
Can you start next week, yes?

14:14.687 --> 14:16.564
Our sincere apologies.

14:16.731 --> 14:18.404
It won't happen again.

14:18.566 --> 14:19.488
I hope not.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.448
Thank you... Come on.

14:23.654 --> 14:25.656
The dress wouldn't have
suited her.

14:25.823 --> 14:28.827
She said you called her
old and fat.

14:28.993 --> 14:30.586
You said you were
going to train me.

14:30.745 --> 14:32.713
Not in common sense!

14:34.332 --> 14:35.458
Go down to the stock room.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.844
You're just going to have
to stay off the shop floor

14:38.002 --> 14:39.094
until I've got time for you.

14:41.547 --> 14:45.893
Mr. Lyons, I know design is
not my area of expertise.

14:46.052 --> 14:49.056
But whereas customers used
to enjoy a free passage

14:49.222 --> 14:51.520
from Beauty to Stationery...

14:59.524 --> 15:01.117
Oh!

15:01.275 --> 15:02.902
Mmm.

15:03.069 --> 15:05.413
I'm pretty sure they'll
just walk round it.

15:09.534 --> 15:11.753
CRABB:
I don't see the point.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.458
It's... it's in the way.

15:13.621 --> 15:14.747
If they have to stop,

15:14.914 --> 15:16.587
they have to look,
and if they have to look,

15:16.749 --> 15:18.922
they might see something
they like.

15:19.085 --> 15:22.464
That's a great idea.

15:22.630 --> 15:23.802
I'm going to use that.

15:23.965 --> 15:25.057
We'll speak later,
Mr. Lyons.

15:25.216 --> 15:26.468
But...

15:26.634 --> 15:28.136
Mrs. Edwards has a routine
meeting scheduled.

15:28.302 --> 15:30.270
I'm sorry, can we...
can we do this another time?

15:30.430 --> 15:32.603
Miss Plunkett, I need
to set up a meeting tonight

15:32.765 --> 15:34.142
for a new department,

15:34.308 --> 15:35.309
something I've
been working on.

15:35.476 --> 15:36.853
New department?

15:37.019 --> 15:38.145
On the ground floor,
next to Cosmetics.

15:38.312 --> 15:40.235
Mrs. Edwards.

15:55.455 --> 15:59.380
Mrs. Edwards,
what wonderful news!

15:59.542 --> 16:00.794
Your sister's baby.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.258
I wonder what it'll be.

16:03.421 --> 16:06.049
And your parents...
their first grandchild,

16:06.215 --> 16:07.182
Connie says.

16:07.341 --> 16:08.718
They've had quite a wait.

16:12.472 --> 16:13.348
My dear,

16:13.514 --> 16:15.608
it's always a little painful

16:15.766 --> 16:17.188
when we have none of our own.

16:17.351 --> 16:20.150
Actually,
I don't want children.

16:21.439 --> 16:23.237
Never have.

16:23.399 --> 16:26.198
Oh, but you've been
married a while.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.533
I assumed you...

16:28.696 --> 16:30.198
We're very happy
as we are.

16:30.364 --> 16:33.914
Mr. Edwards has his work,
and I run the most successful

16:34.076 --> 16:35.669
department
in Selfridges.

16:35.828 --> 16:39.002
Yes, but to have children

16:39.165 --> 16:40.212
is to be fulfilled...

16:41.709 --> 16:42.926
as a woman.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.513
You haven't got any.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.174
I'm not married.

16:48.341 --> 16:49.513
Well, then don't talk
about things

16:49.675 --> 16:50.551
that you don't understand.

16:59.602 --> 17:02.651
HARRY: The technology
department will start here.

17:05.316 --> 17:08.411
Center stage,
on the ground floor.

17:08.569 --> 17:11.071
Yes, we can pull them in
with a big display,

17:11.239 --> 17:13.583
mixing the familiar
with the new.

17:13.741 --> 17:15.960
What will
it sell?

17:16.117 --> 17:17.869
Radios, telephones...

17:18.037 --> 17:19.414
They sell very well
where they are.

17:19.579 --> 17:20.797
LYONS:
So they could help

17:20.957 --> 17:22.459
to sell other things.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.218
Like experimental products.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.220
Things we'll being using in
everyday life in the future.

17:26.378 --> 17:27.300
Like the televisor.

17:27.463 --> 17:28.555
LYONS: If they aren't being made

17:28.714 --> 17:30.591
in the next few years,
I will eat my hat.

17:30.758 --> 17:31.725
Ha.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.182
So, they're not
being made now?

17:34.345 --> 17:36.268
We will take orders.

17:36.430 --> 17:39.525
(Miss Plunkett clears
her throat)

17:39.684 --> 17:40.560
May I say,

17:40.726 --> 17:43.320
there are some very exciting
domestic products--

17:43.479 --> 17:47.325
electric washing machines,
vacuum cleaners...

17:47.483 --> 17:49.235
"Tomorrow's house."

17:49.402 --> 17:51.120
You're a genius,
Miss Plunkett.

17:51.279 --> 17:52.952
What about
the Tea Emporium?

17:54.740 --> 17:56.208
People like tea.

17:56.367 --> 17:57.493
We must look
to the future.

17:57.660 --> 18:00.413
If we don't,
someone else will.

18:11.591 --> 18:12.638
All right, love?

18:12.800 --> 18:14.177
Mind your toes,
sweetheart.

18:22.226 --> 18:23.944
Mr. Lyons.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.276
It's like a building site
in here.

18:26.439 --> 18:27.816
Can't they work nights?

18:27.982 --> 18:30.656
Chief wants it
done pronto.

18:30.818 --> 18:32.741
It's exciting,
isn't it?

18:34.947 --> 18:36.699
(loud crash)

18:39.744 --> 18:42.463
These dresses are designed
to be simple and elegant,

18:42.622 --> 18:44.420
and most importantly,

18:44.582 --> 18:45.708
they must fit.

18:45.875 --> 18:47.047
ELLIS:
It's all in the cutting.

18:47.209 --> 18:49.507
Each of these sections
must be copied exactly.

18:49.670 --> 18:52.298
And in three different sizes.

18:52.465 --> 18:53.387
Three.

18:53.549 --> 18:54.425
You see,
there's my problem.

18:54.592 --> 18:56.560
Three just seems so few.

18:56.719 --> 18:59.017
Women come in
so many different shapes.

18:59.180 --> 19:02.400
Any thoughts
on that?

19:02.558 --> 19:07.314
(indistinct chatter)

19:08.689 --> 19:09.906
Miss Brockless?

19:10.066 --> 19:11.238
(chatter stops)

19:21.202 --> 19:24.923
If we cut these panels
on the bias...

19:25.081 --> 19:27.880
here...

19:28.042 --> 19:31.216
...and here,

19:31.379 --> 19:33.177
well, the fabric will fall
much more softly.

19:33.339 --> 19:33.965
(snorts)

19:34.131 --> 19:35.678
(women snickering)

19:37.218 --> 19:39.220
More flattering.

19:39.387 --> 19:41.264
More forgiving shape.

19:41.430 --> 19:44.058
We could get more sizes.

19:44.225 --> 19:45.602
It would take longer.

19:46.686 --> 19:47.687
Would it work?

19:51.440 --> 19:52.908
Then that's what we'll do.

19:53.067 --> 19:56.071
Well done, Miss Brockless.

19:56.237 --> 19:57.614
Right, my ladies,

19:57.780 --> 20:02.206
back to work
and this time with gusto.

20:02.368 --> 20:04.166
WOMAN: Right, girls, let's
get these panels made.

20:04.328 --> 20:05.420
Well done.

20:16.465 --> 20:17.933
Do you think
the Chief's all right?

20:18.092 --> 20:20.140
We'll be selling things
that don't exist.

20:20.302 --> 20:22.225
Excuse me, sir.

20:25.891 --> 20:28.565
I could have done
with a quiet few weeks.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.901
You're entitled
to time off.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.441
Even with the store
like an ant's nest.

20:37.027 --> 20:38.745
Thank you.

20:42.950 --> 20:44.702
(knock at door)
Come in.

20:44.869 --> 20:45.745
(door opens)

20:50.207 --> 20:51.083
Full-page adverts

20:51.250 --> 20:52.877
in four papers.

20:53.043 --> 20:54.545
That's how you get
people's attention.

20:54.712 --> 20:58.967
The new department will
blaze a trail, Mr. Grove.

20:59.133 --> 21:00.601
Yes.

21:02.720 --> 21:04.893
Look, I know there's
never a good time

21:05.055 --> 21:06.181
to ask such a thing.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.271
Could l...?

21:08.434 --> 21:10.107
Chief?

21:10.269 --> 21:11.987
Are you all right?

21:13.606 --> 21:14.823
Yeah, just
a little lightheaded.

21:14.982 --> 21:17.326
You've only just recovered.

21:17.485 --> 21:18.486
I'm pacing myself,
I'm sorry.

21:18.652 --> 21:20.529
What... what were
you asking?

21:22.615 --> 21:24.538
It can wait.

21:26.494 --> 21:27.837
Excellent advertisements.

21:38.255 --> 21:40.303
Ma.

21:40.466 --> 21:42.093
You shouldn't be up this late.

21:42.259 --> 21:44.136
Neither should you.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.397
I've been at the store.

21:46.555 --> 21:49.024
I thought your fall
would be a warning.

21:49.183 --> 21:51.151
To take things a little easier.

21:51.310 --> 21:54.735
And spend more time
with your family.

21:56.482 --> 21:58.029
Have you seen Gordon yet?

21:58.192 --> 22:00.866
(Sighs)

22:01.028 --> 22:03.076
I still can't believe
he talked to the papers.

22:03.239 --> 22:06.038
Gordon never said
those things.

22:06.200 --> 22:07.793
How come we can all see it,
but you can't?

22:07.952 --> 22:10.330
I think that article
hit a nerve in you.

22:10.496 --> 22:11.713
But whatever it is
you're scared of,

22:11.872 --> 22:14.000
it has nothing to do
with Gordon.

22:14.166 --> 22:19.343
He's loyal, and respectful,
and you owe him an apology.

22:21.423 --> 22:23.926
I'll talk to him
when things are a little calmer.

22:29.265 --> 22:31.188
Make sure you do, son.

22:33.519 --> 22:37.069
One day there will come
a time for you to leave.

22:37.231 --> 22:41.281
And when that happens,
you're really going to need him.

22:49.994 --> 22:51.837
HARRY:
Welcome, welcome.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.466
We have a very special array
of events for you today.

22:55.624 --> 22:59.845
We bring you the very latest
in fashion

23:00.004 --> 23:03.178
with the help of the
world-famous Dolly sisters.

23:03.340 --> 23:06.640
(applause)

23:06.802 --> 23:08.850
And introducing
a brand new department:

23:09.013 --> 23:10.936
Technology.

23:11.098 --> 23:14.102
(applause)

23:14.268 --> 23:18.023
Everything you could want
for the house of the future.

23:18.188 --> 23:20.441
And if you turn on
your wireless sets,

23:20.608 --> 23:25.614
at 3:00 p.m. we have a real
Selfridges treat for you.

23:25.779 --> 23:28.123
(radio static)

23:28.282 --> 23:30.455
HARRY: In classic
Selfridges style

23:30.618 --> 23:32.586
we bring you a live broadcast

23:32.745 --> 23:35.214
from the Palm Court
with a very special guest.

23:35.372 --> 23:38.091
(applause)

23:43.464 --> 23:44.431
(Sighs)

23:47.176 --> 23:48.098
You look wonderful.

23:48.260 --> 23:49.386
Oh, well,
that's the whole idea.

23:49.553 --> 23:50.600
Hello.
Hello.

23:52.014 --> 23:53.687
Everyone is very excited
about the Dolly sisters.

23:53.849 --> 23:55.647
Actually, where are they?

23:55.809 --> 23:57.186
That is a very good
question.

23:57.353 --> 23:59.947
They should have been here...
oh, half an hour ago.

24:01.231 --> 24:02.574
MAN:
Madame Rennard?

24:02.733 --> 24:04.155
Thank you.

24:04.318 --> 24:05.194
Who are they from?

24:07.363 --> 24:08.364
Harry.

24:08.530 --> 24:09.531
Don't look at me.

24:12.743 --> 24:13.995
"The beautiful Mae.

24:14.161 --> 24:15.504
"Good luck with the launch.

24:15.663 --> 24:17.791
"Hope to see you at my own
launch at the Queensway Theatre.

24:17.957 --> 24:18.924
Jimmy Dillon."

24:20.918 --> 24:22.841
Yes, well,
never mind Jimmy.

24:23.003 --> 24:26.007
If those Dollies aren't here
soon, we're in trouble, Harry.

24:26.173 --> 24:27.174
They'll be here.

24:27.341 --> 24:28.308
Come meet the press.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.094
(honking)

24:33.472 --> 24:35.395
(honking)

24:36.809 --> 24:39.062
(giggling)

24:39.228 --> 24:41.356
REPORTER: It's a bit early
in the day for you two.

24:41.522 --> 24:43.149
Oh, don't worry,
we've been up all night.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.942
REPORTER: Jenny, Rosie, how long
will you be staying in London?

24:45.109 --> 24:46.031
As long as
you'll have us.

24:46.193 --> 24:47.911
What are you going
to be up to?

24:48.070 --> 24:49.617
Now that would
be telling.

24:49.780 --> 24:50.702
Are you pleased
to be modeling

24:50.864 --> 24:51.990
for Madame Rennard's
new line'?

24:52.157 --> 24:53.875
We'd do anything
for Harry Selfridge.

24:54.034 --> 24:54.910
Anything at all.

24:56.328 --> 24:59.707
(sisters laughing)

24:59.873 --> 25:01.295
Harry!

25:01.458 --> 25:04.712
Oh, Jenny, Rosie.

25:04.878 --> 25:06.095
Hi, Harry.

25:08.716 --> 25:11.469
Miss Plunkett, these are
the famous Dolly sisters.

25:11.635 --> 25:13.057
Ladies,
my personal secretary.

25:13.220 --> 25:14.062
Hey-

25:14.221 --> 25:16.064
We brought champagne.

25:16.223 --> 25:17.270
It's a bit early

25:17.433 --> 25:18.650
for me, ladies.

25:18.809 --> 25:20.607
Ah, Mr. Crabb, please
escort these ladies

25:20.769 --> 25:22.191
to the fashion show?

25:22.354 --> 25:24.777
I have to take a phone call
with your friend Jimmy Dillon.

25:24.940 --> 25:26.567
I'll be five minutes.
Of course.

25:26.734 --> 25:27.701
Fashion.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.077
Do you want a drink?

25:29.236 --> 25:30.112
CRABB:
No, thank you.

25:30.279 --> 25:31.701
I must say, ladies...

25:31.864 --> 25:32.740
Oh, come on!

25:32.906 --> 25:34.533
You can have one.

25:35.784 --> 25:36.751
Fashion, please.

25:39.038 --> 25:41.882
You shouldn't have said
we'd been up all night.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.418
Why not?

25:43.584 --> 25:45.427
We were.

25:45.586 --> 25:46.838
It looks unprofessional.

25:47.004 --> 25:48.927
It could have been worse.

25:49.089 --> 25:51.842
I could have told them
I'd gone to bed.

25:52.009 --> 25:52.931
And who with.

25:53.093 --> 25:54.811
(snorts)

25:54.970 --> 25:55.892
Oh...

25:58.974 --> 26:02.399
Here, maybe it's better
if you do it.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.859
What a darling!

26:05.022 --> 26:06.490
Thank you.

26:15.949 --> 26:17.576

27:24.309 --> 27:27.939
So very easy to put on
and take off.

27:28.105 --> 27:29.857
(applause)

27:31.692 --> 27:33.990
Well, thank you very much
for being with us.

27:34.153 --> 27:37.874
How easy is it
to take off these clothes?

27:38.699 --> 27:40.201
Shall we see?

27:41.702 --> 27:44.251
(giggles)

27:44.413 --> 27:45.630
Come on.

27:49.042 --> 27:51.261
(playing up-tempo music)

28:00.804 --> 28:02.056
We are so lucky to have
the Dolly sisters

28:02.222 --> 28:03.223
here with us today.

28:06.852 --> 28:08.149
Such... lively girls.

28:13.483 --> 28:14.951
Today's busy modern woman
doesn't have time

28:15.110 --> 28:15.986
for bespoke tailoring.

28:17.529 --> 28:19.327
She wants beautiful clothes

28:19.489 --> 28:22.789
that can be admired,
tried on

28:22.951 --> 28:24.999
and purchased

28:25.162 --> 28:26.755
in her lunch hour.

28:26.914 --> 28:29.133
(sisters giggling)

28:32.502 --> 28:34.095
Ready?

28:34.254 --> 28:36.632
(giggling)

28:39.551 --> 28:42.475
(applause)

28:48.769 --> 28:50.066
Please don't go away.

28:50.229 --> 28:52.197
We have another stage star
performing here shortly

28:52.356 --> 28:55.200
in a special radio broadcast.

28:55.359 --> 28:56.326
Stay with us.

28:56.485 --> 28:57.702
(applause)

28:57.861 --> 28:59.613
Bravo.

28:59.780 --> 29:01.623
Let's hope they can
keep their clothes on.

29:06.453 --> 29:09.878
She only got the job because
it's Mr. Grave's daughter.

29:10.040 --> 29:12.463
Well, she's down
in the stock room now.

29:12.626 --> 29:14.128
There's girls that'd kill
for that job.

29:14.294 --> 29:16.046
It should go to someone
who deserves it.

29:16.213 --> 29:18.466
Mind you, there's a lot
of that around here.

29:21.176 --> 29:22.723
ELLIS:
Looks like it's going well.

29:22.886 --> 29:25.514
You get this lot done,
I'll take you all out for tea

29:25.681 --> 29:26.898
at the Lyons' corner house.
Brilliant!

29:27.057 --> 29:30.106
Joyce, race you!

29:30.269 --> 29:32.192
Come on, then, you got
to go faster than that.

29:32.354 --> 29:33.401
<i>MAN:

29:40.529 --> 29:42.372
This is London LW calling.

29:42.531 --> 29:44.158
London LW.

29:44.324 --> 29:46.918

this afternoon to introduce

29:47.077 --> 29:49.375
Mr. Harry Selfridge.

29:49.538 --> 29:52.587

29:57.004 --> 29:59.803

Miss Plunkett.

33:33.803 --> 33:36.773
Mrs. Edwards,
may I have a moment, please?

33:39.768 --> 33:41.145
I wanted to apologize.

33:41.311 --> 33:45.737
It's none of my business
if you have children or not.

33:45.899 --> 33:49.403
Miss Blenkinsop and I
had no right to pry.

33:51.571 --> 33:53.744
I was engaged
when I was young.

33:53.907 --> 33:56.956
My fiancé died
in South Africa.

33:57.118 --> 33:59.291
The Boer War?

33:59.454 --> 34:02.628
There was never
anyone after him.

34:02.791 --> 34:05.965
Then there comes a time
when you realize

34:06.127 --> 34:07.845
you'll never have
those little clothes

34:08.004 --> 34:09.176
drying in front
of the fire.

34:13.092 --> 34:14.219
I'm sorry.

34:16.304 --> 34:18.601
People make all kinds
of assumptions.

34:18.764 --> 34:21.609
I should've known better.

34:21.768 --> 34:22.735
Thank you.

34:35.739 --> 34:38.289
I'm sorry I blamed you
for that article.

34:38.451 --> 34:39.452
I was wrong.

34:41.121 --> 34:43.418
Yes, you were.

34:43.581 --> 34:44.583
I'd taken a fall

34:44.748 --> 34:46.217
and I wasn't thinking straight.

34:46.376 --> 34:48.549
(chuckles briefly)

34:54.509 --> 34:57.729
You didn't believe me
because you don't trust me.

34:57.887 --> 34:58.888
That's not true.

34:59.055 --> 35:01.808
You haven't trusted me
since I married Grace.

35:01.975 --> 35:05.821
It was the first thing
I've ever done for myself.

35:05.979 --> 35:09.609
And you took it
as a personal insult.

35:09.774 --> 35:14.280
Who I marry is up to me.

35:14.446 --> 35:16.448
As far as the business goes,

35:16.615 --> 35:18.663
all I've ever tried to do
is follow in your footsteps.

35:18.825 --> 35:19.792
You can't.

35:22.454 --> 35:23.751
You're your own man.

35:23.913 --> 35:25.130
(knock at door)

35:25.290 --> 35:26.337
Mr. Dillon is
waiting for you

35:26.499 --> 35:27.751
in the Palm Court.

35:35.342 --> 35:38.061
You don't want to be tied
to my side at the store.

35:38.219 --> 35:39.095
I understand.

35:40.972 --> 35:42.815
I do trust you.

35:47.145 --> 35:48.943
Thank you.

35:59.407 --> 36:03.162
HARRY: So sorry to
have kept you waiting.

36:03.328 --> 36:04.545
Mr. Selfridge.
Harry.

36:04.704 --> 36:05.296
Jimmy.

36:05.455 --> 36:06.707
Thank you for coming.

36:08.833 --> 36:11.712
I think we got off
on the wrong foot

36:11.878 --> 36:13.300
the other night
at Victor's.

36:13.463 --> 36:15.761
I'm curious about
your business.

36:15.924 --> 36:17.642
I hear you're making
quite a name for yourself.

36:17.801 --> 36:19.428
Something about
a big theater deal?

36:19.594 --> 36:20.971
Why didn't you ask me
to your club?

36:21.137 --> 36:23.060
(laughs)

36:23.223 --> 36:24.691
I like to meet people here.

36:24.849 --> 36:26.271
Would they let me in?

36:26.434 --> 36:27.606
Or would they say,
"Mr. Selfridge, sir,

36:27.769 --> 36:31.319
not here,
not one of them"?

36:31.481 --> 36:33.825
They would let you in
if you were with me.

36:35.944 --> 36:38.447
When I first
came here to London,

36:38.613 --> 36:40.832
I was an outsider.

36:40.990 --> 36:44.244
An American upstart and
they called me a shopkeeper.

36:44.411 --> 36:45.958
It wasn't a compliment.

36:46.121 --> 36:48.499
I know what it's like to have
doors not open for you.

36:48.665 --> 36:50.633
You have to fight.

36:50.792 --> 36:52.760
But sometimes you can
pick the wrong fight.

36:56.005 --> 36:57.097
(laughs)

37:02.512 --> 37:07.234
When I first came
to London, I came here.

37:07.392 --> 37:08.234
To Selfridges.

37:08.393 --> 37:10.896
I was six years old.

37:11.062 --> 37:13.815
My mother came here to buy me
a toy to cheer me up.

37:13.982 --> 37:17.202
We'd moved here
from the country.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.863
I'd never been
to London before.

37:20.029 --> 37:23.374
This building
was like a palace.

37:23.533 --> 37:24.785
I asked her who lived here.

37:24.951 --> 37:27.045
I'd heard so many stories

37:27.203 --> 37:31.800
about my father's
palace in India.

37:31.958 --> 37:35.132
She laughed and said,
"No one lives here.

37:35.295 --> 37:37.013
It's a store."

37:37.172 --> 37:40.051
I said,
"Then who is Selfridge?"

37:40.216 --> 37:42.264
She said,
"It's his store."

37:42.427 --> 37:44.850
And I thought...

37:45.013 --> 37:47.732
I thought,
but he must be a prince.

37:50.018 --> 37:53.238
To own something so magnificent.

37:58.735 --> 38:00.282
What did she buy you?

38:01.905 --> 38:03.828
A clockwork train.

38:06.367 --> 38:08.335
One of our best sellers.

38:08.495 --> 38:09.997
Still very popular.

38:13.666 --> 38:16.636
(both chuckling)

38:16.795 --> 38:18.593
You're doing
market research?

38:18.755 --> 38:20.177
Never stops.

38:20.340 --> 38:22.183
How did you do it?

38:22.342 --> 38:23.389
How did you do it?

38:23.551 --> 38:25.474
I was going to ask
you the same question.

38:25.637 --> 38:26.479
You first.

38:26.638 --> 38:28.390
(chuckling)

38:46.533 --> 38:47.876
Can't that wait?

38:48.034 --> 38:49.786
Papers need them first thing.

38:53.289 --> 38:59.638
I know we said
when we got married that...

38:59.796 --> 39:01.423
neither of us wanted children.

39:01.589 --> 39:03.262
Ah.

39:03.424 --> 39:05.552
This is Connie's baby, isn't it?

39:05.718 --> 39:09.313
Well, it seems to be
what most people want.

39:10.765 --> 39:12.767
Most women.

39:12.934 --> 39:14.652
Do you want a baby?

39:14.811 --> 39:15.528
No.

39:16.980 --> 39:18.357
Do you?

39:18.523 --> 39:18.989
No!

39:20.441 --> 39:21.613
I mean, I never thought

39:21.776 --> 39:22.993
we were
that sort of couple.

39:23.152 --> 39:24.449
(Sighs)

39:24.612 --> 39:25.704
Me neither.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.286
(Sighs)

39:27.448 --> 39:28.870
ls that all right?

39:29.033 --> 39:32.583
I suppose it's all right
if we want it to be.

39:35.498 --> 39:38.547
I love my work.

39:38.710 --> 39:42.135
I love being out in the world.

39:42.297 --> 39:43.173
Earning money.

39:43.339 --> 39:45.592
Hmm.

39:45.758 --> 39:49.012
If we had children,
I'd have to give all that up.

39:49.178 --> 39:50.054
You're ambitious.

39:50.221 --> 39:51.143
There's nothing wrong with that.

40:00.732 --> 40:03.360
So I told you this job
had to be on my terms.

40:03.526 --> 40:06.530
Have you seen what
the papers are saying

40:06.696 --> 40:08.494
after you dropped
the Dolly sisters on me?

40:08.656 --> 40:10.750
You've had some
great publicity.

40:10.909 --> 40:12.377
No, no, they have
and you have.

40:14.078 --> 40:15.580
But this is my line.

40:17.248 --> 40:19.717
Harry, I'm so grateful
for everything you've done.

40:19.876 --> 40:22.049
You... you know I think
the world of you.

40:22.211 --> 40:23.383
But if you compromise me

40:23.546 --> 40:27.596
or my work again,
it's over.

40:32.722 --> 40:34.395
He's all yours.

40:39.771 --> 40:42.149
Where's my wonderful Harry?

40:42.315 --> 40:44.568
Rosie.

40:44.734 --> 40:45.951
Where's Jenny?

40:46.110 --> 40:47.737
Out.

40:47.904 --> 40:49.906
I thought we might join her.

40:50.073 --> 40:52.292
There's a floating party later

40:52.450 --> 40:54.077
at this hotel.

40:55.203 --> 40:55.999
Baccarat.

40:56.162 --> 40:58.790
(chuckles)

40:58.957 --> 41:01.005
Don't you ever sleep?

41:01.167 --> 41:04.967
Plenty of time for that
when we're dead.

41:05.129 --> 41:06.551
I almost died

41:06.714 --> 41:08.466
a few weeks back.

41:08.633 --> 41:10.351
It makes you think.

41:10.510 --> 41:12.512
Terrible habit.

41:12.679 --> 41:13.601
(chuckles)

41:13.763 --> 41:16.892
You don't worry about tomorrow?

41:25.400 --> 41:27.368
(whispering):
Ask me in the morning.

41:50.717 --> 41:53.345
The night is young.

41:56.097 --> 41:57.440
(giggles)

41:57.598 --> 41:59.521
(doorbell rings)

42:00.810 --> 42:02.687
(door opens)

42:02.854 --> 42:05.027
MAE:
<i>ls Mr. Dillon in?</i>

42:05.189 --> 42:06.987
MAN: <i>Certainly, Madame,
please do come in.</i>

42:10.445 --> 42:12.618
Madame Rennard.

42:14.866 --> 42:19.588
I got your flowers
and your message.

42:19.746 --> 42:20.872
Can I get you a drink?

42:35.720 --> 42:39.475
I started out
as a show girl.

42:39.640 --> 42:43.361
I've had two husbands,
I've no interest in a third.

42:44.979 --> 42:47.778
I'm not Harry Selfridge's
"plus one."

42:47.940 --> 42:49.863
And I don't need looking after.

42:51.319 --> 42:53.196
So what do you want?

43:45.373 --> 43:49.378
(gramophone needle scratching)

44:00.054 --> 44:01.977
(needle scratching)

44:12.150 --> 44:14.494
Ma, let's get you
up to bed.

44:14.652 --> 44:16.871
Ma?

44:17.029 --> 44:18.281
Ma...

44:18.447 --> 44:20.324
Ma...

44:20.491 --> 44:21.333
Let's...

44:27.915 --> 44:29.292
(voice breaking):
Ma.

44:29.458 --> 44:30.880
Ma, Ma.

44:31.305 --> 44:37.238
