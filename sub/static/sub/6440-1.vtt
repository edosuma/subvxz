00:43.710 --> 00:46.838
This has got to stop.
Open your eyes, Lex!

00:47.013 --> 00:48.241
I can't!

00:48.481 --> 00:50.813
Luthors are not afraid!

00:51.051 --> 00:54.817
We don't have that luxury.
We're leaders.

00:56.456 --> 01:01.826
You have a destiny. You'll never
get anywhere with your eyes closed.

01:07.434 --> 01:10.232
Abracadabra.

01:11.938 --> 01:14.338
- Afternoon, Nell.
- Jonathan!

01:16.576 --> 01:19.340
Martha. What a surprise.

01:19.612 --> 01:22.080
What brings the reclusive
Kents to town?

01:22.348 --> 01:24.873
Tulips. Red ones, if you have them.

01:25.118 --> 01:26.915
What about a tiger orchid?

01:27.120 --> 01:30.385
No, thanks. Martha has
her heart set on tulips.

01:30.924 --> 01:34.951
Yes, well, they are a very
uncomplicated flower.

01:37.230 --> 01:40.927
That's a beautiful dress, Lana!
Are you a princess?

01:41.201 --> 01:44.136
- I'm a fairy princess.
- Where are her parents?

01:44.370 --> 01:48.466
They're at the homecoming game.
I'm being the good aunt.

01:48.708 --> 01:50.539
Do you want to make a wish?

01:50.810 --> 01:53.210
I would love to make a wish.

01:53.446 --> 01:55.812
Abracadabra.

02:09.262 --> 02:11.787
I know what you wished for.

02:12.232 --> 02:16.601
I see a little face.
It's all I ever wanted.

02:26.246 --> 02:29.977
Hey, looks like Smallville won again.

02:52.505 --> 02:54.439
Lex? Son?

02:57.143 --> 02:58.508
Now, where do I sign?

02:58.711 --> 03:00.372
Right here, Mr. Luthor.

03:11.057 --> 03:13.025
- Help me.
- Huh?

03:18.898 --> 03:20.889
Help me, please.

03:46.259 --> 03:48.193
Hey, kid...

03:54.434 --> 03:55.696
Help me.

03:56.769 --> 03:58.828
Help me, please.

04:29.769 --> 04:32.203
What on God's Earth...?

04:37.877 --> 04:39.276
Hi, Lana!

04:39.545 --> 04:41.137
Mommy! Daddy!

05:41.174 --> 05:43.335
What's happening, Jonathan?

05:52.151 --> 05:56.850
Lex! Lex! Where are you?

06:21.381 --> 06:24.009
Lex? Lex?

07:12.298 --> 07:13.697
Martha?

07:37.457 --> 07:40.824
Kids don't just fall out
of the sky, Martha.

07:42.595 --> 07:47.430
- Then where did he come from?
- I don't know.

07:47.633 --> 07:49.464
But he must have parents.

07:54.173 --> 07:57.836
If he does, they're
definitely not from Kansas.

08:05.485 --> 08:08.079
Sweetheart, we can't keep him.

08:08.287 --> 08:11.017
What'll we say?
We found him in a field?

08:11.290 --> 08:14.123
We didn't find him.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.420
He found us.

08:51.864 --> 08:54.059
Clark, you're gonna be late!

08:54.300 --> 08:55.562
Coming, Mom.

09:00.106 --> 09:03.405
- Ah, ah!
- It tastes better from the bottle.

09:03.676 --> 09:06.736
- Where'd you learn your manners?
- On a farm.

09:09.115 --> 09:11.174
Afternoon, sleepyhead.

09:11.450 --> 09:15.750
I have class tonight so you two are
on your own. And no pizza!

09:16.222 --> 09:18.190
There's food in the fridge.

09:19.025 --> 09:21.391
Hey, what you got there, son?

09:21.627 --> 09:22.924
Permission slip.

09:23.729 --> 09:28.757
It's for the football team. They're
having tryouts this afternoon.

09:29.035 --> 09:32.198
- You played football, Dad.
- That was different.

09:32.538 --> 09:34.597
- Why?
- You know why.

09:36.142 --> 09:37.700
I'll run at half speed-

09:37.910 --> 09:40.902
Lot of things can happen
in the heat of the game.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.071
Most new guys hardly even play.

09:43.249 --> 09:49.085
Chances are I'll ride the bench
half the season. I can be careful.

09:53.426 --> 09:56.953
I know you can be careful,
but what if there's an accident?

10:02.001 --> 10:07.268
Look, Clark, I know this has gotta
be really hard for you...

10:07.506 --> 10:10.407
...but hang in there like we promised.

10:10.843 --> 10:12.470
I'm sick of hanging in there.

10:12.745 --> 10:16.237
All I wanna do is go through high school
without being a total loser.

10:41.607 --> 10:44.167
I can't believe you bet against him.

10:44.443 --> 10:48.379
If the clock moved
any slower, he'd be extinct.

11:11.357 --> 11:14.274
- So did anyone ask you to the dance?
- Not yet.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.035
Maybe you and I could go.

11:16.310 --> 11:19.473
Not as a date thing,
more of a friend thing.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.571
Hi, guys.

11:21.882 --> 11:24.578
Didn't you just-?
Weren't you-?

11:24.851 --> 11:27.718
- I took a shortcut.
- Through a black hole?

11:27.888 --> 11:34.157
You'll have to excuse our reporter.
Her "weirdar" is on Defcon 5.

11:34.230 --> 11:38.223
Just because everyone ignores
the strange things that go on...

11:38.467 --> 11:40.731
...doesn't mean they don't happen.

11:40.970 --> 11:45.100
We'd love to join you and
Scooby for another zany adventure...

11:45.374 --> 11:48.866
...but we need to hand in these
slips before homeroom.

11:49.212 --> 11:53.581
I'm having second thoughts.
I don't think it's a good idea.

11:53.816 --> 11:55.283
This is the only way.

11:55.551 --> 11:59.248
Wait. You two are trying
out for the football team?

11:59.488 --> 12:03.219
What is this, some
sort of teen suicide pact?

12:05.728 --> 12:07.923
We're trying to avoid
being a scarecrow.

12:08.264 --> 12:11.961
What are you talking about,
and why the whispering?

12:12.235 --> 12:16.331
It's tradition. Before the game,
the players pick a freshman...

12:16.639 --> 12:19.665
...take him and paint
an S on his chest.

12:19.976 --> 12:24.106
- String him up like a scarecrow.
- Sounds like years of therapy.

12:24.347 --> 12:26.178
That's why we're trying out.

12:26.449 --> 12:28.940
They won't choose one of their own.

12:36.158 --> 12:39.025
- I'll see you guys in class.
- Bye.

12:41.764 --> 12:43.994
- Give him 10 seconds.
- Five.

12:44.267 --> 12:49.364
One, two, three, four, five.

12:52.508 --> 12:53.873
Statistical fact.

12:54.143 --> 12:56.873
He can't get within 5 feet
of Lana Lang...

12:57.179 --> 12:59.511
...without turning into
a freak show.

13:00.349 --> 13:01.714
Nietzsche.

13:04.820 --> 13:07.687
Didn't realize you had
a dark side, Clark.

13:08.958 --> 13:12.155
- Doesn't everybody?
- Yeah, I guess so.

13:15.731 --> 13:18.859
So, what are you, man or superman?

13:20.636 --> 13:24.402
- Haven't figured it out yet.
- Lana. There you are.

13:27.376 --> 13:28.638
Hey, Clark.

13:30.413 --> 13:33.211
I was wondering if you
could do me a favor.

13:33.482 --> 13:37.680
Could you check my English paper?
I didn't finish until 2 a. m.

13:37.987 --> 13:42.048
- I'm not sure about the ending.
- I'll bet it's great.

13:44.860 --> 13:48.057
Dude. Are you feeling all right?

13:48.331 --> 13:52.700
- You look like you're about to hurl.
- I'm fine.

13:58.174 --> 14:00.005
You forgot one, Clark.

14:20.029 --> 14:21.724
Payback time.

14:48.531 --> 14:49.862
Thanks, Dad.

15:00.376 --> 15:05.609
Ready! Down! Set! Hike!

15:12.355 --> 15:18.487
<i>Red and gold no doubt
We're here to win one out</i>

15:26.691 --> 15:30.092
Clark! How do I look?

15:31.497 --> 15:33.124
Like a tackle dummy.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.031
Good luck.

17:06.058 --> 17:09.027
Come on, don't die on me!

17:24.777 --> 17:27.007
I could've sworn I hit you.

17:28.381 --> 17:32.078
If you did, I'd be...

17:32.752 --> 17:34.879
I'd be dead.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.130
Clark!

17:53.138 --> 17:55.606
- Son, are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

17:55.808 --> 17:59.300
- Who's the maniac driving the car?
- That would be me.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.204
Lex Luthor.

18:04.383 --> 18:07.716
I'm Jonathan Kent. This is my son.

18:07.987 --> 18:09.716
Thanks for saving my life.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.751
I'm sure you'd have done the same.

18:13.325 --> 18:17.762
You have an extraordinary boy.
If there's any way I can repay you-

18:17.963 --> 18:20.295
You could drive slower.

19:10.349 --> 19:12.374
My aunt'll be back any minute.

19:12.685 --> 19:15.518
Oh, come on!
We're living on the edge.

19:15.788 --> 19:20.282
If Aunt Nell finds us here,
your life won't be worth living.

19:20.492 --> 19:24.690
- Where is she anyway, bridge club?
- Lex Luthor's.

19:25.164 --> 19:28.224
I didn't know your aunt was in
with the Luthors.

19:28.400 --> 19:29.992
She sold them a ton of land.

19:30.169 --> 19:33.605
They own the Metropolis Sharks.
She could put in a good word.

19:33.772 --> 19:36.832
If you want a good word, ask Clark.

19:37.242 --> 19:41.201
- He saved Lex's life today.
- You're kidding.

19:41.513 --> 19:45.005
Sometimes people can surprise you.

19:45.217 --> 19:47.185
I think it's kind of cool.

19:49.722 --> 19:53.055
Coach said a scout from Kansas State
is coming to the game on Saturday.

19:53.325 --> 19:54.587
That's great.

19:55.828 --> 19:59.389
I don't want to be a "Remember him?"

19:59.665 --> 20:02.225
Smallville's got enough of those guys.

20:06.538 --> 20:09.803
I want you to wear this to the game.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.541
I can't take this.

20:13.746 --> 20:16.306
You can give it back after you win.

20:16.715 --> 20:21.709
Is it really made from a piece
of the meteor that, you know...?

20:22.888 --> 20:25.755
So much bad luck came out of it...

20:26.625 --> 20:29.458
...there can only be good luck left.

21:02.194 --> 21:05.686
Jeez, kid! Scared the crap out of me.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.301
Don't I know you?

21:18.343 --> 21:22.780
You look like that scarecrow kid.
Where the hell you been?

21:25.350 --> 21:27.841
Hey, freakazoid, wake up.

21:36.862 --> 21:41.322
That was 12 years ago, man.
That was just a game.

21:42.835 --> 21:44.666
What do you want?

21:46.572 --> 21:48.403
To play.

22:06.992 --> 22:09.756
- Hey, Mom, whose truck?
- Yours.

22:10.395 --> 22:12.886
It's a gift from Lex Luthor.

22:18.837 --> 22:22.830
"Dear Clark: Drive safely.
Always in your debt...

22:23.075 --> 22:25.737
...the maniac in the Porsche. "

22:26.011 --> 22:28.605
I don't believe it.
Where are the keys?

22:28.847 --> 22:31.111
Your father has them.

22:46.098 --> 22:50.694
I know how much you want it, son,
but you can't keep it.

22:50.903 --> 22:55.101
- Why not? I saved the guy's life.
- So you deserve a prize?

22:55.407 --> 22:57.671
That's not what I meant.

22:59.278 --> 23:02.234
How about you drive the new one,
and I'll drive the old one?

23:02.269 --> 23:06.010
- Everybody wins.
- It's not about winning, Clark.

23:07.986 --> 23:11.854
It's not like the Luthors
can't afford it.

23:14.264 --> 23:18.701
Clark, I know you're upset, son,
but it's normal.

23:21.038 --> 23:22.300
Normal?

23:25.676 --> 23:28.042
How about this?
Is this normal?

23:34.785 --> 23:38.721
I didn't dive in after Lex's car.
It hit me at 60 mph.

23:39.156 --> 23:44.219
Does that sound normal to you?
I'd give anything to be normal.

24:09.987 --> 24:11.579
It's time, son.

24:13.724 --> 24:15.692
Time for what?

24:17.561 --> 24:19.688
The truth.

24:24.601 --> 24:27.331
I want you to take a look
at something.

24:28.772 --> 24:34.233
I think it's from your parents.
Your real parents.

24:39.016 --> 24:40.449
What does it say?

24:40.617 --> 24:42.261
I tried to decipher it for years,

24:42.270 --> 24:45.645
but it's not written in
any language known to man.

24:46.123 --> 24:48.284
What do you mean?

24:49.827 --> 24:54.958
Your real parents weren't exactly
from around here.

24:55.165 --> 24:57.156
Where are they from?

25:06.844 --> 25:11.008
What are you trying to tell me dad?
I'm from another planet?

25:14.518 --> 25:18.318
I suppose you stashed
my spaceship in the attic.

25:19.790 --> 25:21.985
Actually, it's in the storm cellar.

25:28.265 --> 25:31.496
This is how you came
into our world, son.

25:31.835 --> 25:34.167
It was the day of the meteor shower.

25:34.671 --> 25:37.162
This is a joke, right?

25:43.714 --> 25:46.683
Why didn't you tell
me about this before?

25:47.351 --> 25:50.946
- We wanted to protect you.
- Protect me from what?

25:51.154 --> 25:53.054
You should have told me.

25:53.724 --> 25:56.989
Clark. Clark!

26:15.779 --> 26:18.179
- Who's there?
- It's me.

26:19.750 --> 26:21.115
Clark.

26:22.085 --> 26:24.246
Clark Kent?

26:24.588 --> 26:27.455
What are you doing
creeping around the woods?

26:27.758 --> 26:30.249
You'd never believe me if I told you.

26:30.761 --> 26:33.889
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

26:35.032 --> 26:36.294
Clark, wait.

26:37.034 --> 26:40.868
Just wasn't expecting
to see anyone out here.

26:41.038 --> 26:42.300
Are you okay?

26:43.240 --> 26:47.973
I'm hanging out in a graveyard.
Does that strike you as okay behavior?

26:48.211 --> 26:51.408
Hey, I'm here too.

26:53.750 --> 26:57.083
Good point. What's your story?

27:01.024 --> 27:03.219
Can you keep a secret?

27:04.962 --> 27:07.590
I'm the Fort Knox of secrets.

27:08.398 --> 27:09.763
I...

27:10.534 --> 27:14.061
...came out here
to talk with my parents.

27:15.539 --> 27:21.068
You must think I'm pretty weird,
conversing with dead people.

27:22.112 --> 27:25.377
I don't think you're weird, Lana.

27:26.450 --> 27:28.645
Do you remember them?

27:30.120 --> 27:32.281
They died when I was 3.

27:32.489 --> 27:33.751
I'm sorry.

27:34.558 --> 27:37.083
It's not your fault, Clark.

27:37.894 --> 27:40.795
Come on, I'll introduce you.

27:44.134 --> 27:46.125
Mom, Dad?

27:46.336 --> 27:48.668
This is Clark Kent.

27:49.306 --> 27:51.103
Say hi.

27:51.341 --> 27:53.036
Hi.

27:54.745 --> 27:57.407
Yeah, he is kind of shy.

27:58.081 --> 28:00.641
How should I know?

28:02.019 --> 28:05.420
Mom asks if you're upset about a girl.

28:08.658 --> 28:13.152
- Dad asks if it's about a guy.
- No, no.

28:13.363 --> 28:16.696
He has a twisted sense of humor.

28:19.770 --> 28:22.330
Seriously, Clark.

28:22.873 --> 28:25.501
Why are you out here?

28:25.709 --> 28:30.510
Ever feel like your life was
supposed to be something different?

28:33.083 --> 28:37.782
Sometimes I dream I'm at school,
waiting for Nell to pick me up.

28:38.055 --> 28:39.613
But she doesn't come.

28:39.890 --> 28:44.589
My parents drive up and they're
not dead, they're just really late.

28:44.795 --> 28:50.734
I get in their car and we drive back
to my real life in Metropolis.

28:50.934 --> 28:52.868
That's when I wake up.

28:53.904 --> 28:58.432
And for a minute, I'm totally happy.

28:58.909 --> 29:02.401
Until I realize I'm still alone.

29:09.519 --> 29:12.010
What's that, Mrs. Lang?

29:14.157 --> 29:16.819
Yeah, I'll tell her.

29:17.461 --> 29:20.328
Your mom wants you to know
you're never alone.

29:20.897 --> 29:25.561
That she's always looking over you.
No matter what.

29:29.706 --> 29:31.867
What's that, Mr. Lang?

29:33.076 --> 29:36.477
Your dad thinks you're a shoo-in
for homecoming queen.

29:40.350 --> 29:41.977
They really say all that?

29:42.552 --> 29:47.649
Oh, they're quite chatty
once you get them started.

29:53.597 --> 29:55.497
Thanks for walking me home.

29:55.699 --> 29:57.929
Beats creeping around the woods.

29:59.436 --> 30:03.736
You realize this is the longest
conversation we've ever had?

30:04.274 --> 30:06.242
We should do it again.

30:06.443 --> 30:07.774
Yes, we should.

30:11.248 --> 30:13.273
So are you going to the dance?

30:13.517 --> 30:15.542
Yeah, with Whitney.

30:15.752 --> 30:18.380
Right, of course.

30:19.256 --> 30:20.621
How about you?

30:22.192 --> 30:24.456
No, figured I'd sit it out.

30:27.564 --> 30:29.930
If you change your mind...

30:30.200 --> 30:32.930
...I might save you a dance.

30:36.907 --> 30:39.034
Good night, Clark.

31:06.269 --> 31:07.497
Hello?

31:12.409 --> 31:13.671
Hello?

31:32.596 --> 31:33.927
Clark?

31:34.798 --> 31:36.322
I didn't see you.

31:36.866 --> 31:39.426
I buzzed, but no one answered.

31:40.770 --> 31:42.397
How'd you get through the gate?

31:42.572 --> 31:44.938
Kind of squeezed through the bars.
If this is a bad time-

31:45.108 --> 31:50.341
No, I think Heiki has sufficiently
kicked my ass for the day.

31:50.614 --> 31:52.377
This is a great place.

31:53.016 --> 31:56.563
If you're dead and in the
market for something to haunt.

31:56.564 --> 31:57.885
I meant it's roomy.

31:59.108 --> 32:01.474
How's the new ride?

32:01.711 --> 32:03.804
That's why I'm here.

32:04.046 --> 32:07.038
What's the matter?
You don't like it?

32:07.249 --> 32:10.377
No, it's not that.
I can't keep it.

32:11.454 --> 32:16.221
Clark, you saved my life.
I think it's the least I can do.

32:18.828 --> 32:20.921
Your father doesn't like me.

32:21.297 --> 32:25.427
It's okay. I've been
bald since I was 9.

32:25.668 --> 32:29.297
- I'm used to people judging me.
- It's not personal.

32:29.505 --> 32:32.167
He's just not crazy
about your dad.

32:32.742 --> 32:36.109
Figures the apple doesn't
fall far from the tree?

32:36.312 --> 32:37.973
Understandable.

32:39.348 --> 32:40.975
What about you, Clark?

32:41.450 --> 32:44.908
Did you fall far from the tree?

32:48.858 --> 32:52.259
I'd better go.
Thanks for the truck.

32:54.296 --> 32:55.524
Clark?

32:56.832 --> 32:59.130
Do you believe a man can fly?

33:00.603 --> 33:02.366
Sure, in a plane.

33:02.638 --> 33:04.606
I'm not talking about that.

33:05.207 --> 33:08.608
I'm talking about soaring
with nothing but air beneath you.

33:09.278 --> 33:12.873
- People can't fly, Lex.
- I did.

33:13.849 --> 33:17.615
After the accident,
when my heart stopped.

33:17.887 --> 33:23.154
It was the most exhilarating
two minutes of my life.

33:25.294 --> 33:27.854
I flew over Smallville.

33:28.164 --> 33:30.962
And for the first time...

33:31.200 --> 33:33.964
...I didn't see a dead end.

33:34.570 --> 33:37.061
I saw a new beginning.

33:39.546 --> 33:42.344
We are the future, Clark.

33:42.782 --> 33:46.946
I don't want anything to stand in
the way of our friendship.

33:56.129 --> 34:00.657
- That's the third guy.
- And they're all former jocks.

34:02.068 --> 34:05.333
- Who's the weirdo?
- I don't know.

34:05.572 --> 34:08.563
Let's check him out.

34:08.842 --> 34:11.902
His name's Jeremy Creek.
This is a picture of him 12 years ago.

34:12.178 --> 34:15.806
- This I took four hours ago.
- That's impossible.

34:16.081 --> 34:18.277
He'd be 26.
Must be a kid who looks like him.

34:18.485 --> 34:21.681
My money was on the evil twin theory,
until we checked this missing persons.

34:21.922 --> 34:24.417
Jeremy disappeared from the state infirmary
 a few days ago,

34:24.452 --> 34:26.156
where he'd been in a coma for 12 years.

34:26.157 --> 34:28.821
They say he's suffering from
massive electrolyte imbalance.

34:29.029 --> 34:31.360
- That's why he hasn't aged a day.
- So you're telling me he just woke up?

34:31.531 --> 34:32.929
No, there was a huge electrical storm.

34:33.166 --> 34:37.068
The hospital's generator went down,
and when it came back on, Jeremy was gone.

34:37.337 --> 34:39.498
Electricity must charged him up
like a Duracell.

34:39.739 --> 34:43.402
And now he's back in Smallville,
putting former jocks into comas. Why?

34:43.610 --> 34:48.342
Because 12 years ago today, they chose
Jeremy Creek as the scarecrow.

34:48.614 --> 34:51.777
"Comatose boy found in few 20
yards from meteor strike. "

34:52.085 --> 34:54.831
The exposure to the blast must
have done something to his body.

34:54.853 --> 34:57.112
No, this can't be right.

34:57.390 --> 35:02.191
- I think you ought to show him.
- Show me what?

35:10.103 --> 35:13.630
It started out as a scrapbook
and just kind of mutated.

35:13.807 --> 35:15.069
What is it?

35:15.375 --> 35:18.401
I call it the Wall of Weird.

35:18.712 --> 35:23.206
It's every strange, bizarre and unexplained event 
that's happened in Smallville since the meteor shower.

35:23.450 --> 35:27.113
That's when it all began.
The town went schizo.

35:29.255 --> 35:33.885
- What do you think?
- Why didn't you tell me about this?

35:34.160 --> 35:39.427
Do you tell me everything that happened in
your life? We all keep secrets, Clark.

35:49.709 --> 35:51.267
Lana?

35:53.184 --> 35:55.448
It's all my fault.

36:11.035 --> 36:13.094
Chloe, just leave me alone.

36:13.404 --> 36:17.170
Congratulations, Clark.
You're this year's scarecrow.

36:17.442 --> 36:20.843
- Don't mess with me right now.
- Come on, bring it on!

36:30.855 --> 36:33.085
- What's with you and Lana?
- Nothing.

36:38.196 --> 36:40.960
Like her necklace? Huh?

36:41.265 --> 36:45.224
Good, because it's as close
as you'll ever get to her.

37:19.404 --> 37:21.201
Never changes.

37:22.674 --> 37:24.869
Help me.

37:25.443 --> 37:27.934
Hurts, doesn't it?

37:30.782 --> 37:32.716
You're Jeremy.

37:32.951 --> 37:36.079
I thought if I punished
them, it'd stop.

37:36.354 --> 37:38.015
But it never stops.

37:42.794 --> 37:44.785
Wait.

37:45.029 --> 37:46.291
Where are you going?

37:46.598 --> 37:50.261
Homecoming dance.
I never made it to mine.

37:50.535 --> 37:54.027
Get me down. Please?

37:54.239 --> 37:56.400
You're safer here.

38:14.993 --> 38:16.654
Help me.

38:26.738 --> 38:28.296
Help me.

38:35.747 --> 38:37.271
Clark?

38:39.651 --> 38:41.619
Oh, jeez.

38:42.420 --> 38:44.081
Who did this to you?

38:44.289 --> 38:46.450
Doesn't matter.

38:55.800 --> 38:58.325
You need to see a doctor.

38:58.603 --> 39:02.972
- I'll be okay.
- At least let me give you a ride.

39:41.112 --> 39:44.707
Jeremy, you need to stop this.

39:50.388 --> 39:53.118
I don't know how you got here.

39:54.525 --> 39:59.360
- You should have stayed away.
- I won't let you hurt my friends.

39:59.631 --> 40:02.259
Those people aren't your friends.

40:02.433 --> 40:04.958
The sprinklers will get them nice and wet.
I'll handle the rest.

40:05.236 --> 40:08.501
- They never did anything to you.
- I'm not doing this for me.

40:08.740 --> 40:10.731
I'm doing this for you and
for the others like us!

40:11.209 --> 40:15.475
What happened to you was my fault.
I can understand your pain.

40:15.713 --> 40:17.806
I'm not in pain.

40:18.049 --> 40:19.812
I have a gift...

40:20.051 --> 40:23.714
...a purpose and a destiny.

40:23.988 --> 40:25.319
So do I.

40:34.999 --> 40:36.694
Give it up, Jeremy.

41:42.834 --> 41:44.665
Are you okay?

41:44.902 --> 41:46.631
Who are you?

41:49.841 --> 41:51.433
Where am I?

41:52.677 --> 41:56.807
I'm Clark Kent,
and you're in Smallville.

41:59.917 --> 42:01.578
I want to go home.

42:52.652 --> 42:55.712
I didn't see you tonight, Clark.

42:57.323 --> 42:58.620
Lana.

43:01.528 --> 43:03.689
What are you doing here?

43:07.067 --> 43:09.467
I saved you that dance.

43:30.824 --> 43:33.315
Is everything okay, Clark?

43:36.429 --> 43:38.488
It's perfect.

44:02.922 --> 44:05.413
Thanks for the dance, Lana.

44:06.305 --> 44:12.643
