01:37.723 --> 01:38.969
Afraid of flying?

01:39.684 --> 01:41.013
You shouldn't be.

01:41.143 --> 01:43.932
It's really safe. Except in that movie.

01:44.355 --> 01:47.855
They had this creature
on the wing of the plane.

01:55.032 --> 01:57.073
Heard they based that on a true story.

02:04.583 --> 02:06.910
Planes crash all the time.

02:07.420 --> 02:09.876
They cover it up and buy off the witnesses.

02:10.089 --> 02:12.248
Where the hell are the flight attendants?

02:12.925 --> 02:16.544
It's all based on the aerodynamics
of hydrometeorology.

02:17.346 --> 02:20.348
Ever heard of the Mile High Club?

02:24.353 --> 02:25.683
Come on.

02:29.442 --> 02:30.937
He's sick.

02:31.193 --> 02:32.274
Come on.

02:41.120 --> 02:42.864
I don't know if we should do this.

02:43.456 --> 02:44.406
You think?

02:44.749 --> 02:46.576
No. We should.

02:49.795 --> 02:51.623
Get over here!

03:37.468 --> 03:41.087
"You're going down."

03:41.263 --> 03:42.925
I sure am, baby.

03:43.474 --> 03:45.966
No, Rob! Stop!

04:31.731 --> 04:33.523
What the fuck's going on?

04:33.774 --> 04:35.234
Let's go! Go!

04:42.992 --> 04:44.108
Oh, God!

05:06.641 --> 05:07.887
Mayday! Mayday!

05:17.151 --> 05:18.231
Cut!

05:19.695 --> 05:23.314
Guys! When I say "cut," that means stop!

05:28.287 --> 05:29.319
Thank you.

05:31.624 --> 05:34.412
Sandra, you're not supposed
to fly the plane.

05:34.835 --> 05:35.666
Jesus!

05:35.962 --> 05:37.042
Vanessa.

05:37.505 --> 05:40.708
Thanks for getting the boom
in the shot again. Yeah, you, too.

05:41.217 --> 05:42.463
Poor Sandra.

05:43.427 --> 05:45.136
He whines like a real director.

05:46.722 --> 05:49.179
I'm sorry. You know, who are we kidding?

05:49.600 --> 05:52.970
She's no Jamie Lee Curtis, right?
But she'll get better.

05:53.104 --> 05:56.687
Young man, that woman's acting
would be wretched in a porno film.

06:00.569 --> 06:04.189
He's right. I've seen her in them.
She's really bad.

06:04.323 --> 06:06.780
- I thought there was--
- Shut up, Scrote.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.743
Get me some coffee.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.792
<i>Let's try something new this time.</i>

06:15.459 --> 06:18.331
<i>Why don't you get it right or I'll kill you!</i>

06:19.171 --> 06:20.204
Okay?

06:21.674 --> 06:24.296
Let's try it again. Back to one.

06:24.719 --> 06:26.262
<i>Take 41.</i>

06:27.013 --> 06:28.045
Effects up.

06:30.766 --> 06:32.096
Effects up!

06:34.687 --> 06:36.597
- Roll sound.
- Soundspeed.

06:36.981 --> 06:38.524
- Roll camera.
- Rolling.

06:38.649 --> 06:40.394
Scene 16, Take 41.

06:40.651 --> 06:42.360
Fucking action.

07:24.487 --> 07:26.611
<i>As chairman of the film department...</i>

07:27.114 --> 07:31.694
<i>...I want to wish you all the best
as you return for the spring semester...</i>

07:32.536 --> 07:36.666
<i>...and remind you that yours
is the honour and the privilege to attend...</i>

07:36.874 --> 07:39.543
<i>...the greatest film school
that ever existed.</i>

07:39.961 --> 07:42.797
<i>So, let's try and not burn the place down.</i>

07:43.506 --> 07:44.669
<i>Mr. Solomon?</i>

07:47.051 --> 07:48.961
<i>Did everyone have a nice holiday?</i>

07:50.721 --> 07:53.260
<i>I'd like to personally welcome
Melvin Zarcoff...</i>

07:53.432 --> 07:56.185
<i>...who joins us
after a distinguished Hollywood career.</i>

07:56.268 --> 07:57.432
<i>Welcome.</i>

08:00.022 --> 08:03.724
<i>Mr. Zarcoff is a veteran of over 50 films....</i>

08:05.069 --> 08:07.643
$10 he croaks
before the end of the semester.

08:08.948 --> 08:11.903
You don't have $10.
You spent it on your shitty movie.

08:12.118 --> 08:14.657
- A little courtesy?
- Shut the fuck up.

08:14.745 --> 08:16.241
You're so mean.

08:16.580 --> 08:19.452
<i>Clive LaVey has a Super-8 course...</i>

08:19.583 --> 08:20.616
Action!

08:20.751 --> 08:24.002
<i>...which is required before you go on to....</i>

08:24.171 --> 08:26.545
Isn't he the one that did
<i>Vampire Cheerleaders</i> ?

08:26.882 --> 08:29.884
No, that was Nick LaVey.
Clive did the <i>Splattertown</i> sequels.

08:30.052 --> 08:31.512
Not enough blood for me.

08:31.595 --> 08:34.134
<i>Some of you have yet
to submit your screenplays.</i>

08:35.474 --> 08:38.595
<i>At the end of the semester,
you may submit your thesis films...</i>

08:38.727 --> 08:42.145
<i>...to be considered for
the prestigious Hitchcock Award...</i>

08:43.107 --> 08:48.268
<i>...which not only carries with it,
as you all know, a $15,000 stipend...</i>

08:48.738 --> 08:52.783
<i>...but I'm proud to say, has become
a springboard to Hollywood success...</i>

08:53.242 --> 08:55.948
<i>- ...for such alumni as...</i>
- Cecily Spector.

08:56.662 --> 08:58.572
- Josh Bouvet.
<i>- ...Josh Bouvet...</i>

08:58.956 --> 09:00.155
Chip Voelker.

09:00.666 --> 09:02.126
<i>...and Chip Voelker.</i>

09:32.490 --> 09:33.949
Young lady! Come here!

09:36.285 --> 09:39.904
- What are you doing out here in the dark?
- I was going to the library.

09:40.039 --> 09:42.827
Alone? At this hour? In this weather?

09:43.376 --> 09:45.334
Get in this car. I'll drive you.

09:50.383 --> 09:51.664
So cold.

09:54.303 --> 09:58.136
No, "Show me your badge."
No, "Can I see some ID?"

09:59.016 --> 10:00.725
Can I see some ID?

10:02.019 --> 10:03.016
I got no ID.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.386
Where you going?

10:04.855 --> 10:07.264
- Over the bridge to the--
- Library, right.

10:07.858 --> 10:09.651
Good for you, baby.

10:12.613 --> 10:15.568
- My name's Reese. What's yours, sugar?
- I'm Amy.

10:17.118 --> 10:19.740
Nice lion. You ever hide a gun in there?

10:20.413 --> 10:22.702
- What makes you say that?
- I'm a film student.

10:23.040 --> 10:26.291
I had a class last semester
where we saw Pam Grier....

10:26.836 --> 10:30.372
She had this film where she hides a gun
inside a lion like that.

10:30.756 --> 10:31.789
<i>Coffy.</i>

10:31.924 --> 10:34.712
- Right.
- That's one of my favourite films of hers.

10:36.262 --> 10:39.430
I even have my gun
trimmed in gold like hers.

10:39.557 --> 10:40.756
Look at that.

10:42.059 --> 10:45.975
- I've always been partial to <i>Foxy Brown.</i>
- "That's my sister, baby.

10:46.147 --> 10:49.102
"She's a whole lot of woman!"

10:50.901 --> 10:52.860
You gonna do action movies like <i>Coffy</i> ?

10:53.029 --> 10:54.358
I don't know.

10:54.780 --> 10:57.735
I have to turn in a thesis
and I can't think of a good story.

11:01.662 --> 11:04.415
- I got a good story.
- Oh, yeah?

11:04.999 --> 11:09.578
Yeah, it's about a campus serial killer
who murders eight students...

11:10.296 --> 11:14.129
...but nothing happens because
the prestigious university covers it up.

11:14.759 --> 11:17.844
I heard this one.
It supposedly happened at Pendleton.

11:18.346 --> 11:19.675
It's just an urban legend.

11:19.764 --> 11:21.259
You didn't let me finish.

11:22.058 --> 11:24.300
After the murders, the chief of security...

11:24.393 --> 11:27.099
...who refused to go along
with the cover-up, is fired.

11:27.271 --> 11:29.644
Spends the entire year looking for work.

11:30.274 --> 11:33.810
Finally lands an entry-level position
at another university.

11:39.575 --> 11:41.320
Thanks for the ride.

11:42.078 --> 11:45.198
- Yeah, baby, anytime.
- Have a good night.

11:49.835 --> 11:52.043
Urban legend, my ass.

11:54.382 --> 11:58.048
A thing that a lot of film historians
don't seem to be able to gauge...

11:58.135 --> 12:03.012
...is the impact of mise en scène
on cinéma vérité storytelling.

12:03.349 --> 12:07.727
On the other hand, it could be argued
mise en scène or staging...

12:07.937 --> 12:11.140
...are two examples
that are basically mutually exclusive.

12:11.524 --> 12:15.569
What is cinéma vérité
if not the absence of staging?

12:15.861 --> 12:17.061
- And so on.
- Come in.

12:17.154 --> 12:19.943
- Godard's accident victims...
- I'll come back later.

12:20.032 --> 12:23.651
- No. Come in.
- ...draped in the trees in the countryside.

12:23.828 --> 12:26.534
I just had an idea for my thesis film.

12:27.290 --> 12:28.785
Come in. Sit down.

12:29.917 --> 12:31.460
Hi, Dr. Fain.

12:35.631 --> 12:40.590
The movie is about a serial killer whose
murders are based on urban legends.

12:46.225 --> 12:47.471
That's cool.

12:48.102 --> 12:51.721
But not exactly what we've come to expect
from a Mayfield.

12:51.814 --> 12:55.350
I know, but I think I'm ready
for a work of fiction.

12:55.526 --> 12:58.148
I think you are, too. You mind, Richard?

13:01.324 --> 13:05.322
Thanks. You can get the door
on your way out.

13:07.872 --> 13:09.201
What do you think?

13:10.291 --> 13:11.490
Horror or suspense?

13:12.376 --> 13:13.658
A little bit of both.

13:14.295 --> 13:15.576
Just like Hitchcock.

13:17.256 --> 13:19.582
Hitchcock's themes might serve you well.

13:20.051 --> 13:24.263
Paranoia, fear of imprisonment,
wrong man accused...

13:25.014 --> 13:27.932
...how the lines blur
between fantasy and reality.

13:29.310 --> 13:30.639
You think it's okay?

13:31.520 --> 13:32.601
It's great.

13:37.068 --> 13:40.235
Who would've thought
you'd be the next Spielberg?

13:40.404 --> 13:41.401
Yeah, right.

13:41.530 --> 13:44.319
Enjoy it. Next year
you'll be in the real world.

13:45.493 --> 13:47.036
Here's to unemployment.

13:47.203 --> 13:50.324
Here's to you for saving my ass again.

13:59.090 --> 14:00.205
Two more.

14:20.945 --> 14:23.188
Do I get a private screening
when I get back?

14:23.322 --> 14:24.604
We'll have to see.

14:24.699 --> 14:28.484
I worked my ass off on your film,
and every film you've done.

14:28.577 --> 14:30.701
I know you did, and I love you for it.

14:31.247 --> 14:32.410
Thanks.

14:37.628 --> 14:39.373
Here's to you loving me for it.

14:47.346 --> 14:48.379
Drink up.

14:48.931 --> 14:52.384
- Don't you have a plane to catch?
- Wasted is the only way to fly.

14:54.103 --> 14:57.971
I've got to go finish working on my film.
So have a safe trip.

14:59.275 --> 15:01.150
- See you when you get back.
- 'Bye.

15:17.793 --> 15:19.787
That guy's a real spaz.

15:20.630 --> 15:22.457
You know, I'm a director, too.

15:23.215 --> 15:24.415
Really?

15:25.509 --> 15:27.170
Directors make a lot of money?

15:28.387 --> 15:29.337
Pretty much.

15:30.264 --> 15:32.424
Then you won't mind paying for the drinks.

15:42.026 --> 15:43.225
Excuse me.

15:51.827 --> 15:52.824
Excuse me.

16:03.214 --> 16:04.164
Hello?

18:36.701 --> 18:38.528
<i>911. Please state your emergency.</i>

18:38.703 --> 18:40.613
I just woke up in a tub of ice--

18:40.913 --> 18:43.203
<i>- Don't tell me, your kidney's gone.</i>
- Yes.

18:43.749 --> 18:46.952
<i>Honey, I got Princess Di on line four.
I got to go.</i>

18:47.378 --> 18:48.410
What?

20:17.176 --> 20:18.173
Check it out.

20:18.594 --> 20:20.802
It's a tradition during finals week.

20:21.263 --> 20:23.091
Everybody's up late studying...

20:23.182 --> 20:27.892
...and at midnight,
everyone screams as a release of tension.

20:28.938 --> 20:32.522
At the same time
between midnight and 12:01...

20:33.025 --> 20:35.149
...a co-ed is brutally attacked.

20:35.736 --> 20:40.399
Her screams go unnoticed, drowned out
by the screams of those around her.

20:41.117 --> 20:44.736
- True story, right?
- Yeah, I heard it happened at Harvard.

20:45.079 --> 20:46.111
No.

20:48.332 --> 20:49.744
It's an urban legend.

20:50.584 --> 20:53.586
Like that girl who eats a burrito
with the pregnant roach...

20:53.713 --> 20:55.955
...and the eggs hatch inside of her nose?

20:56.966 --> 20:59.921
Or like that girl who takes a bite
of a chicken sandwich...

21:00.011 --> 21:03.796
...and she discovers that the mayonnaise
is really pus from a chicken tumour?

21:03.931 --> 21:07.384
There's that guy who has crabs
who unzips his fly--

21:07.518 --> 21:08.598
Okay!

21:10.062 --> 21:11.807
You definitely have the idea.

21:12.398 --> 21:14.059
But I have my thesis film.

21:15.276 --> 21:16.688
Is there a role for me?

21:17.111 --> 21:18.690
You can scream, can't you?

21:35.338 --> 21:37.794
<i>Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!</i>

22:04.825 --> 22:07.744
<i>- What are you doing?
- We'll have to see it again.</i>

22:07.870 --> 22:09.828
<i>No, you can't go in there again!</i>

22:09.914 --> 22:12.038
<i>Jason, come on. Stop!</i>

22:15.294 --> 22:17.454
You guys scared the shit out of me.

22:18.798 --> 22:20.590
We're movie monsters.

22:21.092 --> 22:23.299
- Want to be the Count?
- The Count sucks.

22:24.428 --> 22:25.509
Get it?

22:27.598 --> 22:29.426
Travis Stark, film genius.

22:29.517 --> 22:31.427
- What are you doing?
- Looking for her.

22:31.519 --> 22:34.640
She was looking for you.
She was trying to get her mack on.

22:34.730 --> 22:35.763
Totally.

22:37.316 --> 22:38.313
Sorry.

22:38.401 --> 22:40.275
Let's play hopscotch.

22:42.947 --> 22:43.979
Anyway.

22:45.074 --> 22:48.325
- Is this your thesis film?
- Yeah, but it's not done.

22:48.536 --> 22:50.197
I'm sure it's a mess right now.

22:51.163 --> 22:52.824
I wouldn't call it a mess.

22:52.915 --> 22:54.410
Right, I mean....

22:54.875 --> 22:58.542
I just got my script approved
for my film and thought...

22:58.879 --> 23:00.754
...you'd want to take a look at it.

23:02.008 --> 23:05.378
Why don't you come by Tuesday night
and we'll talk about it?

23:05.678 --> 23:09.463
Okay. I'll call you about it on the phone.

23:19.483 --> 23:21.607
I hear cell phones give you brain cancer.

23:22.194 --> 23:24.568
- That's an urban legend.
- Too bad.

23:24.864 --> 23:26.692
This is what we're going to film.

23:27.199 --> 23:29.240
Here's a $20. Go wash my car.

23:29.410 --> 23:30.691
Go ahead.

23:31.078 --> 23:33.570
You know he's a P.A., not a slave, right?

23:34.123 --> 23:35.404
Same difference.

23:35.583 --> 23:38.371
The guy's applied to film school
three times now.

23:39.754 --> 23:42.328
There's this girl who's afraid of the dark.

23:42.423 --> 23:45.591
She puts her hand down
and if her dog licks her hand...

23:45.760 --> 23:47.421
...she knows everything's okay.

23:47.511 --> 23:49.885
Can I be the dog?
Because I'm a great licker.

23:50.056 --> 23:51.432
That's what Dirk told me.

23:52.058 --> 23:55.261
Anyway, when she wakes up
in the morning, she walks...

23:55.353 --> 23:59.398
...into her bathroom and sees her dog
hanging from the shower rod.

23:59.482 --> 24:00.597
There's this message.

24:02.026 --> 24:04.020
Latex and Cornflakes. We can do that.

24:04.111 --> 24:05.986
Latex and Cornflakes?

24:06.530 --> 24:08.857
One call to my old man
and we can go digital.

24:09.325 --> 24:11.283
Digital sucks. Latex rules.

24:11.369 --> 24:14.121
That's not what your god
George Lucas says.

24:14.747 --> 24:17.619
Well, fuck George Lucas.

24:21.337 --> 24:23.295
- You're going to hell, man.
- I know.

24:25.633 --> 24:29.217
I need to talk to you, Mayfield. In private.

24:30.388 --> 24:31.551
I'll be right back.

24:32.556 --> 24:35.724
- Where were you?
- This is a nice script, Mayfield.

24:36.227 --> 24:37.426
Nice horror script.

24:37.520 --> 24:40.972
It seems similar,
but I'm going for a paranoid thriller--

24:41.065 --> 24:45.111
That's bullshit.
Mayfield, you stole my fucking genre.

24:46.445 --> 24:48.937
- Trust me. I'm not stealing anything.
- Trust you?

24:50.408 --> 24:52.401
Yeah. I should trust you.

24:52.910 --> 24:54.619
To steal a Hitchcock from me.

24:55.037 --> 24:58.573
Nobody is going to steal the Hitchcock
from me...

25:00.293 --> 25:02.120
...especially you, little girl.

25:05.673 --> 25:07.298
Find yourself another D.P.

25:28.070 --> 25:29.696
Are you all right, Travis?

25:32.658 --> 25:34.652
I got graded on my film today.

25:37.663 --> 25:39.289
C-fucking-minus.

25:40.750 --> 25:42.209
How could that happen?

25:43.085 --> 25:44.711
So much for the Hitchcock.

25:46.505 --> 25:48.049
You don't need that.

25:50.134 --> 25:51.677
You're better than that.

25:52.136 --> 25:54.805
You're the most talented filmmaker
at this school.

25:56.807 --> 25:58.552
Amy, I have no money.

26:00.227 --> 26:01.687
I have no connections.

26:05.232 --> 26:07.855
I feel really awful asking this now...

26:09.945 --> 26:11.904
...but I'm kind of desperate.

26:13.199 --> 26:15.489
Toby dropped off my crew today.

26:16.494 --> 26:18.404
You know another D.P. I could use?

26:20.748 --> 26:22.907
Yeah. His name is Simon.

26:24.627 --> 26:26.288
He shot my film.

26:29.256 --> 26:30.752
I can call him if you want.

26:32.093 --> 26:33.125
Okay.

26:42.019 --> 26:43.479
It's going to be okay.

26:49.527 --> 26:50.642
I'll see you.

27:27.315 --> 27:28.181
Hey, guys.

27:28.274 --> 27:30.351
- Anyone seen Sandra?
- Naked, you mean?

27:30.443 --> 27:31.854
Anyone not seen her naked?

27:31.986 --> 27:33.529
I heard that.

27:36.407 --> 27:38.484
- Watch out!
- Oh, my God!

27:39.660 --> 27:41.120
She's....

27:44.206 --> 27:45.406
Oh, my God.

27:46.292 --> 27:47.242
Got you.

27:47.335 --> 27:49.542
She's one hell of an actress, ain't she?

27:51.547 --> 27:52.959
Movie magic.

27:58.304 --> 27:59.680
Oh, my God.

27:59.805 --> 28:01.384
Was I in the moment?

28:02.224 --> 28:04.763
- What were you doing?
- Rehearsing.

28:06.395 --> 28:09.481
I got an audition
to play a coma patient on <i>ER...</i>

28:09.857 --> 28:12.645
- ...with help from Graham's daddy.
- It was nothing.

28:13.194 --> 28:14.772
Thank you, baby.

28:16.697 --> 28:18.323
Let's go watch her clean up.

28:18.991 --> 28:22.492
You hear a noise while you're
in the bedroom. You come in here.

28:22.620 --> 28:26.453
The camera follows you from the doorway.
Comes in. You see the dog.

28:26.582 --> 28:30.451
You turn. You see the message.
Then the killer pops up and you scream.

28:30.753 --> 28:31.999
And that's it.

28:32.797 --> 28:33.912
- Got it?
- Yep.

28:34.215 --> 28:35.295
Picture's up.

28:37.927 --> 28:40.253
Everybody shut up! Picture's up.

28:41.806 --> 28:42.886
Roll sound.

28:43.599 --> 28:46.305
- Whatever. I'll see you later.
- Graham, hello!

28:46.394 --> 28:47.937
Can you hold on a minute?

28:48.854 --> 28:49.851
Speed.

28:49.981 --> 28:51.061
Pardon me?

28:52.733 --> 28:55.308
- Is this the set of Amy Mayfield.
- Yeah. I'm Amy.

28:56.070 --> 29:00.365
I need a reservation
for two for tonight, 8:45.

29:00.658 --> 29:02.118
I'm Schorm Jabuscko.

29:02.827 --> 29:05.663
Travis says you need
a director of photography.

29:07.039 --> 29:09.247
Yeah. Thank you for coming.

29:09.375 --> 29:14.204
Unfortunately, this camera
is all we have to work with, Schorm.

29:17.550 --> 29:19.093
You can call me Simon.

29:20.219 --> 29:21.299
Don't worry.

29:23.264 --> 29:24.545
I bring my own.

29:26.559 --> 29:27.971
This is my baby...

29:30.062 --> 29:31.308
...baby.

29:34.108 --> 29:37.443
You know, you're a very beautiful woman.

29:38.821 --> 29:41.278
Well, you're pretty cute, too, camera boy.

29:41.741 --> 29:44.826
If you were a girl,
I would definitely fuck you.

29:45.328 --> 29:46.443
- Really?
- Yeah.

29:48.623 --> 29:50.663
- Hey, baby.
- Hi, doll-face.

29:50.750 --> 29:52.494
Can I give you a lift?

29:52.960 --> 29:54.669
You already have.

30:06.849 --> 30:08.013
Shit!

30:09.769 --> 30:10.801
Jesus!

30:12.938 --> 30:14.138
Idiot, Sandra.

31:11.914 --> 31:15.284
All right, keys.
Where would I be if I were keys?

31:20.756 --> 31:22.833
Goddamn it. Keys.

31:23.592 --> 31:26.464
Hello. Where are you? Keys.

31:32.810 --> 31:33.807
A mess.

31:39.608 --> 31:41.401
Disgusting. Goddamn it.

32:02.089 --> 32:03.170
Yes.

32:33.621 --> 32:34.653
<i>Cut.</i>

32:34.789 --> 32:37.281
- She sucks.
- Urban Legends, <i>Scene 3, Take 28.</i>

32:38.751 --> 32:40.377
- Dog looks good.
- It does.

32:40.503 --> 32:41.583
<i>Action.</i>

32:44.173 --> 32:48.421
- You could turn it into a comedy.
<i>- Take 20-fucking-9.</i>

32:49.011 --> 32:50.127
<i>Okay, action.</i>

32:56.185 --> 32:58.179
<i>Cut. Please cut.</i>

32:59.063 --> 33:00.060
What the...?

33:07.530 --> 33:09.405
- This isn't us, is it?
- Wrong reel.

33:11.909 --> 33:13.025
That's Sandra.

33:13.244 --> 33:15.700
- What's she doing?
- That's Sandra's best angle.

33:15.955 --> 33:17.948
That's definitely Sandra's ass.

33:18.040 --> 33:19.666
Gratuitous ass shot.

33:29.302 --> 33:30.880
Dude, that looks so real.

33:35.558 --> 33:37.219
Right there. Get her.

34:44.085 --> 34:46.577
They slash a major artery
and that's all the blood?

34:47.964 --> 34:49.956
O.J. left more blood on the Bronco.

34:51.842 --> 34:54.547
- Bravo.
- It was all right.

34:54.762 --> 34:56.257
- The dog was good.
- Yes.

34:59.767 --> 35:01.048
Did you guys do this?

35:01.143 --> 35:02.555
I didn't. Did you?

35:02.770 --> 35:04.764
- Simon?
- No.

35:06.107 --> 35:07.187
But I like it.

35:21.747 --> 35:24.120
Where's the reel
that was on this projector?

35:25.668 --> 35:26.867
I don't know.

35:39.807 --> 35:41.516
You swear you didn't do this?

35:41.600 --> 35:44.057
It was good
but Dirk and I could do much better.

35:44.145 --> 35:45.889
You don't think it was real?

35:46.188 --> 35:48.229
No. Not enough blood.

35:49.317 --> 35:50.978
This is classic Sandra.

35:51.277 --> 35:54.694
- She probably staged it for her reel.
- Then who shot it?

35:56.240 --> 35:59.906
Guys. Travis Stark, he's dead.

36:14.342 --> 36:17.047
By now most of you have heard the news.

36:18.929 --> 36:20.804
For those of you who haven't...

36:21.932 --> 36:24.092
...Travis Stark took his life last night.

36:25.686 --> 36:28.178
It's just hard to know what to say.

36:28.564 --> 36:30.973
He blew his head off in the campus tower.

36:31.233 --> 36:33.144
I mean literally blew it off.

36:33.319 --> 36:34.898
Dental records wouldn't help.

36:34.987 --> 36:37.906
It's important for us to celebrate
who he was...

36:38.032 --> 36:41.900
...and what, I believe, he could've become.

36:42.453 --> 36:45.870
He was a gifted filmmaker
who raised the bar for all of us.

36:46.540 --> 36:50.586
But not only did he let himself down,
he let us all down.

36:51.253 --> 36:54.588
Everybody goes through a time
when they feel alone and helpless.

36:55.007 --> 36:57.297
We need to go easy on ourselves...

36:57.385 --> 37:00.007
...and remember we're just doing
the best we can.

37:00.972 --> 37:06.180
You know, in the movie <i>Day for Night,</i>
Truffaut asked the question:

37:06.936 --> 37:09.226
"Is film more important than life?"

37:32.795 --> 37:34.670
He was a hell of a talent.

37:48.769 --> 37:50.181
Are you okay?

37:51.939 --> 37:52.770
No.

37:54.775 --> 37:56.187
Have you seen Sandra?

37:57.486 --> 37:59.445
Sandra's in a coma, Amy.

37:59.822 --> 38:01.946
On <i>ER</i>, in LA.

38:07.747 --> 38:09.740
You should let me help you, too.

38:10.750 --> 38:12.743
I know you're not hitting on me now.

38:13.669 --> 38:17.170
With my father's connections,
I can get your film done tomorrow.

38:17.715 --> 38:19.459
I'd like to try it by myself.

38:25.848 --> 38:28.423
That is hypocritical bullshit.

38:29.977 --> 38:31.141
I know about you.

38:32.104 --> 38:35.889
- You're a Hollywood kid, like me.
- What? I grew up in Chicago.

38:36.150 --> 38:38.060
Not before 1992 you didn't.

38:38.402 --> 38:42.152
You were 13 years old when you
and your mom moved from Beverly Hills.

38:43.532 --> 38:45.822
After your daddy, Taylor Mayfield died...

38:46.619 --> 38:49.325
...while shooting the nature crap
that you do.

38:49.747 --> 38:51.373
Don't look so surprised.

38:52.124 --> 38:54.581
- It's in your admissions file.
- How did you see that?

38:54.669 --> 38:57.754
Being the daughter of
an Oscar-winning documentary filmmaker...

38:57.838 --> 39:00.247
...didn't hurt your chance of getting in here.

39:00.341 --> 39:02.750
Why don't you cut the girl-next-door crap?

39:04.220 --> 39:05.466
You're a film brat.

39:05.554 --> 39:08.841
You need to make it to save face
just as bad as I do.

39:09.684 --> 39:10.965
Maybe worse.

39:12.770 --> 39:16.140
I'll see you on the set, darling.

39:38.921 --> 39:41.709
<i>I heard he blew his head off
up in the campus tower.</i>

40:55.164 --> 40:56.908
Hello? Who's there?

41:21.774 --> 41:22.806
Travis?

41:25.736 --> 41:28.145
They told me you killed yourself.

41:29.198 --> 41:30.362
You knew him?

41:30.992 --> 41:32.072
What?

41:32.326 --> 41:33.786
My brother. You knew him?

41:34.954 --> 41:37.742
I don't understand.

41:39.500 --> 41:40.829
I'm Trevor Stark.

41:42.920 --> 41:44.499
I'm his brother.

41:46.716 --> 41:49.587
I didn't know that Travis had a brother.

41:51.262 --> 41:53.090
When was the last time you saw him?

41:55.641 --> 41:57.386
I saw him a couple of days ago.

41:58.019 --> 41:59.182
Was he upset?

42:00.229 --> 42:05.058
He was depressed and drinking because
of the grade he got on his thesis film.

42:05.943 --> 42:08.731
He thought he'd lost his chance
at the Hitchcock Award.

42:10.990 --> 42:13.233
I thought that's why you...

42:14.618 --> 42:15.651
...he...

42:16.495 --> 42:17.611
...killed himself.

42:17.705 --> 42:19.745
Is that what everyone thinks?

42:24.879 --> 42:27.205
Wait. Please.

42:27.590 --> 42:29.667
If you're not Travis, why are you here?

42:33.137 --> 42:34.217
Please.

42:39.185 --> 42:41.013
My brother didn't kill himself.

42:42.313 --> 42:44.141
Trust me. He wouldn't do that.

42:45.608 --> 42:47.020
What are you saying?

42:47.485 --> 42:48.944
You think he was murdered?

42:54.742 --> 42:56.321
I know that's what happened.

42:56.410 --> 42:58.985
- Have you said anything to the police?
- I can't.

42:59.372 --> 43:02.077
- Why not?
- I just can't. Listen.

43:03.334 --> 43:05.374
Don't tell anybody you saw me here.

43:08.297 --> 43:09.674
Please.

43:10.424 --> 43:14.886
Something happened to my brother
and I'm going to find out what.

43:24.981 --> 43:29.193
<i>Three, two, one, midnight.</i>

43:33.572 --> 43:34.736
And cut.

43:36.409 --> 43:40.028
Thank you so much. Thank you.
All right, we're done.

43:40.538 --> 43:42.615
You can go home. That's a wrap.

43:42.748 --> 43:44.374
Sorry it was so late.

43:44.750 --> 43:47.622
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

43:47.712 --> 43:51.082
- There's something wrong.
- Nothing.

43:51.924 --> 43:56.053
Hang on. Hey guys,
I need help with these wild tracks.

43:57.763 --> 44:00.255
- Great. They're gone.
- I'll do it.

44:00.349 --> 44:04.395
I just need a wild track of them screaming.
Go home. Get some sleep.

44:04.729 --> 44:06.307
- You sure?
- Yeah. I got it.

44:06.397 --> 44:08.854
- I'll talk to you later.
- 'Bye.

44:10.192 --> 44:12.020
- I must smoke.
- Okay.

44:12.653 --> 44:14.943
I need a bunch of loud screaming.

44:20.286 --> 44:22.493
You're a very beautiful woman.

44:27.293 --> 44:28.872
Is that a Beaulieu?

44:29.086 --> 44:30.665
A Bolieux.

44:30.921 --> 44:33.414
- Can I see it?
- No.

44:36.427 --> 44:38.053
Have a good night.

44:47.772 --> 44:50.098
Okay, and rolling.

44:59.575 --> 45:02.114
Now, remember, guys, nice and loud.

45:59.510 --> 46:00.507
Help.

46:01.304 --> 46:02.503
Help!

46:03.639 --> 46:04.671
Help!

46:06.851 --> 46:08.346
Help!

46:21.574 --> 46:22.571
And cut.

46:25.703 --> 46:27.163
Help me!

47:32.979 --> 47:34.355
Go, girl!

47:34.480 --> 47:35.512
Reese?

47:37.692 --> 47:40.231
Amy! Scared me to death.

47:40.319 --> 47:42.692
Have you been watching these monitors?

47:42.822 --> 47:43.854
Yes.

47:45.449 --> 47:47.443
Are you signing my paycheques now?

47:47.535 --> 47:51.284
I thought I heard someone screaming
like they were being attacked.

47:51.372 --> 47:54.493
- Anybody else hear them?
- I had my headphones on.

47:55.626 --> 47:57.121
I was recording screaming.

47:57.211 --> 47:59.703
Let me get this.
You were recording screaming...

47:59.839 --> 48:03.209
...then you heard screaming.

48:03.301 --> 48:06.053
Baby, I think your movie's
making you paranoid.

48:08.139 --> 48:10.428
Can we play the last hour
of these monitors?

48:10.516 --> 48:15.559
Last hour? Honey, I have rounds to make.
You think I just watch movies?

48:15.646 --> 48:18.434
- Can I just borrow the tapes?
- Borrow them?

48:19.317 --> 48:21.643
I'll bring them back. I promise.

48:28.200 --> 48:29.612
All right.

48:29.744 --> 48:31.536
If you see anything strange...

48:31.620 --> 48:34.788
...and I mean really strange...

48:34.957 --> 48:37.829
...you bring these back to me to look at.

48:39.503 --> 48:42.042
And start wearing a bell or something!

50:06.507 --> 50:07.539
Hello?

50:11.304 --> 50:12.336
Hello?

50:51.719 --> 50:52.751
Stan?

50:53.471 --> 50:54.883
That's not funny.

50:58.267 --> 51:00.308
I'm serious. Stop it.

55:16.984 --> 55:20.319
Goddamn it! Girl, this is getting old!

55:20.404 --> 55:21.947
Somebody's after me.

55:27.912 --> 55:30.581
How'd you find me?

55:33.793 --> 55:36.036
You see? I do watch those things.

55:40.549 --> 55:44.963
One tape was in my bag when I threw it.
I ran out of the scoring stage, but...

55:45.054 --> 55:48.056
...I had another tape. I dropped it.
Did you see it?

55:48.140 --> 55:52.638
I looked, but I didn't see no tape.
Just your crazy white ass in the sewer.

55:52.728 --> 55:55.303
I saw Simon killed. I saw the attack.

55:55.439 --> 55:57.766
Honey, without proof--

55:57.858 --> 55:59.354
This is proof.

56:00.319 --> 56:01.814
Vandals.

56:03.531 --> 56:07.197
But nothing! Any overworked policeman
with a caseload a mile long...

56:07.284 --> 56:09.777
...is going to look at this as vandalism.

56:10.121 --> 56:11.913
Baby, trust me.

56:15.584 --> 56:18.077
It's just the way it is.
Let me take you home.

56:18.170 --> 56:20.081
Get out of them wet clothes.

56:20.965 --> 56:23.172
And maybe I can go home.

56:31.600 --> 56:34.139
<i>Hey, this is Travis. Leave it.</i>

56:34.353 --> 56:36.477
<i>Hey, it's me from the tower.</i>

56:36.856 --> 56:40.475
I don't know if you're staying there,
but I need to talk to you.

56:41.569 --> 56:43.361
It's about Travis.

56:44.655 --> 56:46.316
I think you're right.

56:46.657 --> 56:51.154
After I got away, I realised the footage
of Sandra was real. It wasn't a prank.

56:51.287 --> 56:54.205
You think your friend Sandra
was killed as well?

56:54.290 --> 56:56.959
Yeah. And that would've been the third.

56:57.960 --> 56:59.753
Have you told anyone else?

57:01.047 --> 57:03.336
I was going to tell the police.

57:04.133 --> 57:06.210
You can't tell the police.

57:07.178 --> 57:08.507
Why not?

57:08.763 --> 57:11.255
That's the second time you've said that.

57:18.522 --> 57:20.765
Trevor? Trevor!

57:27.657 --> 57:32.035
Travis and I both
had a certain amount of creativity.

57:32.536 --> 57:36.701
I focused mine on lesser pursuits.

57:36.874 --> 57:42.213
And as a result, my relationship
with the authorities isn't that great.

57:42.546 --> 57:46.545
But thanks to Travis,
I'm starting to get my shit together.

57:47.051 --> 57:50.801
He was always riding me about
never following through on anything.

57:51.889 --> 57:53.764
So I owe it to him.

57:54.350 --> 57:55.679
You know?

57:57.311 --> 57:58.475
Yeah.

57:59.355 --> 58:01.064
Reminds me of my dad.

58:02.608 --> 58:04.518
He was a filmmaker.

58:05.361 --> 58:07.070
Documentaries.

58:08.614 --> 58:10.407
After he died...

58:11.951 --> 58:16.115
...I thought that if I didn't make
documentaries too, that I'd forget him.

58:16.330 --> 58:21.040
But he'd be proud of me to know
I'm doing something I'm passionate about.

58:21.127 --> 58:23.879
That's why I decided
to make this fiction film.

58:25.256 --> 58:28.377
Not because I had any chance at the....

58:31.220 --> 58:32.252
What?

58:33.514 --> 58:35.591
At the Hitchcock award.

58:37.351 --> 58:40.686
The winner's guaranteed a shot
at directing in Hollywood.

58:41.397 --> 58:43.687
You think somebody would kill for that?

58:43.774 --> 58:45.270
Maybe.

58:45.735 --> 58:46.934
Wait a minute.

58:47.194 --> 58:49.105
Where's your shoot tomorrow?

58:49.196 --> 58:51.439
It's at the theme park outside town.

58:51.532 --> 58:56.325
Because if you're right, whoever's doing
this is going to come after you again.

58:56.537 --> 58:59.824
This is our chance to draw out the killer.

59:00.583 --> 59:02.576
Trevor, I can't.

59:03.419 --> 59:06.172
I know you're scared.

59:06.714 --> 59:08.506
I mean, so am I.

59:09.216 --> 59:12.254
But don't we owe it to Travis
and your friends?

59:16.098 --> 59:20.097
I won't let anything happen to you.
I will be there.

59:23.773 --> 59:25.316
Trust me.

59:33.699 --> 59:37.152
<i>- I have a good story for you.
- Sandra's in a coma.</i>

59:37.286 --> 59:39.114
<i>I heard he blew his head off.</i>

59:39.205 --> 59:41.080
<i>Don't tell anybody you saw me here.</i>

59:41.165 --> 59:43.704
<i>Latex and Cornflakes.</i>

59:44.543 --> 59:47.000
<i>- He was a hell of a talent.
- Don't look so surprised.</i>

59:47.088 --> 59:50.291
<i>- So much for the Hitchcock.
- No one's going to steal it from me.</i>

59:50.383 --> 59:53.171
<i>- Lines blur between fantasy and reality.
- I'm good at that.</i>

59:53.260 --> 59:56.346
<i>You need to make it to save face
just as bad as I do.</i>

59:56.514 --> 59:57.760
<i>Tragic day.</i>

59:57.974 --> 59:59.552
<i>- Trust me.
- Paranoia.</i>

59:59.767 --> 01:00:01.143
<i>I know about you.</i>

01:00:01.352 --> 01:00:03.429
<i>- Fear of imprisonment.
- Not what we'd expect.</i>

01:00:03.521 --> 01:00:05.349
<i>- Nice horror script.
- Wrong man accused.</i>

01:00:05.439 --> 01:00:08.394
<i>- Especially you.
- My brother didn't kill himself.</i>

01:00:08.484 --> 01:00:10.228
<i>Don't tell anybody you saw me.</i>

01:00:10.319 --> 01:00:11.898
<i>- I should trust you.
- Trust me.</i>

01:00:12.071 --> 01:00:13.483
<i>Got you.</i>

01:00:29.672 --> 01:00:33.753
Quite the artist. What are you guys
working on? Another urban legend?

01:00:34.010 --> 01:00:36.715
"The Tunnel of Terror."

01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:43.684
<i>A carnival comes to town.
Only it's not like other carnivals.</i>

01:00:43.894 --> 01:00:47.514
<i>It has a Tunnel of Terror,
filled with fake bloody corpses.</i>

01:00:47.648 --> 01:00:50.354
<i>Everybody thinks it's the scariest ride.</i>

01:00:50.735 --> 01:00:54.021
<i>Then in the morning, the carnival's gone...</i>

01:00:54.155 --> 01:00:56.563
<i>...and a bunch of children are missing.</i>

01:00:56.741 --> 01:01:01.534
<i>It turns out that the bodies
were real in the Tunnel of Terror.</i>

01:01:02.788 --> 01:01:04.948
This is the Tunnel of Terror?

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.245
It will be.

01:01:08.961 --> 01:01:10.243
Okay.

01:01:14.717 --> 01:01:16.212
<i>Hello, tenderfoot.</i>

01:01:16.302 --> 01:01:19.387
<i>You must be as high as my tool
to ride the Merry Miners.</i>

01:01:19.513 --> 01:01:20.594
I told you.

01:01:20.681 --> 01:01:22.889
Suki suki now.

01:01:24.935 --> 01:01:26.395
Dead bodies, anyone?

01:01:26.479 --> 01:01:27.393
Oh, my God.

01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:30.897
- So this is our Tunnel of Terror.
- You'll be able to make it work?

01:01:30.983 --> 01:01:33.440
- We need three hours.
- You only have one.

01:01:33.569 --> 01:01:35.148
- Perfect.
- Just negotiate.

01:01:35.237 --> 01:01:37.776
- Wonder Twin powers....
- Activate.

01:01:37.948 --> 01:01:40.441
- Split it. Coming through.
- Make a hole.

01:01:40.826 --> 01:01:42.405
Good luck, boys.

01:01:56.842 --> 01:01:58.172
Sorry, baby.

01:01:59.428 --> 01:02:02.964
Dirk! How you doing down there?

01:02:07.395 --> 01:02:08.938
<i>Back to work, boys.</i>

01:02:09.021 --> 01:02:10.185
Power's up.

01:02:12.441 --> 01:02:14.150
They're alive!

01:02:16.862 --> 01:02:19.271
<i>Take a look at these babies.</i>

01:02:19.365 --> 01:02:22.735
Hurry back up here.
These things are creepy.

01:02:23.035 --> 01:02:27.414
- Scared of miners? Weak sauce, man.
- Shut up and come up here.

01:02:28.457 --> 01:02:31.792
- I can't believe Simon flaked.
- I can.

01:02:32.962 --> 01:02:35.668
What happened to
good old Simon anyway?

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:39.509
What's he doing here?

01:02:39.844 --> 01:02:43.510
Carrying shit. He wanted to help.
So what?

01:02:45.766 --> 01:02:48.093
It's my crew. That's "so what."

01:02:48.477 --> 01:02:50.720
I don't want all these people here.

01:02:52.356 --> 01:02:54.149
<i>Take a look at these babies.</i>

01:02:54.233 --> 01:02:58.481
"This little piggy went wee-wee-wee
all the way home."

01:02:58.696 --> 01:03:00.275
Nice, man.

01:03:00.906 --> 01:03:04.074
You bring up the strobes?
Let me do this one.

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.192
Hi-ho.

01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:07.531
Did you call me a ho?

01:03:07.997 --> 01:03:11.746
Don't you think you're over your head
on this little masterpiece?

01:03:11.876 --> 01:03:14.794
You pull a power trip on me
in front of everybody?

01:03:15.338 --> 01:03:18.043
You shouldn't do that. You know that?

01:03:18.215 --> 01:03:20.008
Not to me, you shouldn't.

01:03:21.302 --> 01:03:23.628
I'm out of here. Pack up this shit.

01:03:33.939 --> 01:03:35.684
This will take a long time.

01:03:35.775 --> 01:03:38.777
You guys go eat
before we get stuck here all night.

01:03:39.028 --> 01:03:40.357
- You sure?
- Yeah.

01:03:40.446 --> 01:03:43.733
I'll just stay here with Dirk and Stan.
Just come back in an hour.

01:03:43.824 --> 01:03:46.613
Okay. I'll bring you back something.

01:03:46.702 --> 01:03:49.490
All right. Guys, lunch. One hour.

01:03:51.165 --> 01:03:52.708
Just be careful.

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:55.419
Always.

01:04:03.469 --> 01:04:06.175
<i>Hey, Dirk! The lights are in place.
How you doing?</i>

01:04:06.263 --> 01:04:07.510
Everything's fine.

01:04:07.598 --> 01:04:08.678
Let her rip.

01:04:12.436 --> 01:04:15.723
- I'm about to go take care of my baby.
<i>- Use a rubber.</i>

01:04:18.317 --> 01:04:20.394
Dirk and Stan, you read me?

01:04:25.116 --> 01:04:28.201
You okay in there? Can you guys read me?

01:04:28.327 --> 01:04:30.368
You coming in for a run-through?

01:04:32.039 --> 01:04:33.618
Yeah. I'm coming now.

01:04:33.708 --> 01:04:35.785
Okay, you push the red....

01:04:35.918 --> 01:04:37.627
<i>No, No. Green.</i>

01:04:37.712 --> 01:04:41.212
<i>Push the green button and pull
the pickaxe. That should start the ride.</i>

01:04:41.299 --> 01:04:43.458
<i>- Go for it.</i>
- Copy that.

01:04:52.143 --> 01:04:56.355
<i>Howdy, tenderfoot, and welcome.
Keep your keister in the seat till the end.</i>

01:04:56.522 --> 01:04:59.358
<i>Don't want to lose any nuggets
along the way.</i>

01:04:59.650 --> 01:05:02.320
<i>So long, stranger.</i>

01:05:04.697 --> 01:05:07.569
She's coming in for a run-through.
Hurry up, man.

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:22.043
Hurry on up!

01:05:22.131 --> 01:05:25.501
We outdid ourselves this time.
She's going to love it!

01:05:57.833 --> 01:05:59.079
Coming up.

01:07:06.235 --> 01:07:08.443
Okay, guys, very funny.

01:07:22.001 --> 01:07:25.869
Guys, okay. I'm really scared. Just stop.

01:07:44.565 --> 01:07:46.642
Guys, are you okay down there?

01:09:52.943 --> 01:09:56.230
Nice set. Where's your crew?

01:09:58.324 --> 01:10:01.492
There's the two of them.
They were both electrocuted.

01:10:02.203 --> 01:10:03.318
Stupid kids.

01:10:03.412 --> 01:10:06.450
- And that's your final statement?
- Yes.

01:10:08.751 --> 01:10:12.417
Anything else you could tell us,
other than the power going out?

01:10:12.964 --> 01:10:14.542
Anything else, sugar?

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:18.718
We can take it from here, Detective.

01:10:25.142 --> 01:10:27.350
No, there's nothing else.

01:10:27.728 --> 01:10:29.888
Okay. We'll be in touch.

01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:44.490
Where were you?

01:10:44.704 --> 01:10:47.456
Is this what you call following through?
You weren't there.

01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:50.625
You didn't do anything.
You didn't protect me.

01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:52.956
That's not true.

01:10:53.629 --> 01:10:56.667
I saw what happened with Graham.
That's why I followed him.

01:10:56.757 --> 01:11:00.258
When I came back, the police
were everywhere. What happened?

01:11:01.512 --> 01:11:03.838
Exactly what you said would happen.

01:11:04.515 --> 01:11:06.094
He came back.

01:11:06.309 --> 01:11:09.145
- And now Dirk and Stan are dead.
- Oh, my God.

01:11:10.604 --> 01:11:12.266
I trusted you.

01:11:13.065 --> 01:11:14.726
Amy, I'm sorry.

01:11:15.693 --> 01:11:17.900
At least we know it's not Graham.

01:11:25.369 --> 01:11:27.992
Not exactly. I lost him.

01:11:31.667 --> 01:11:33.495
I'm wrong about everything.

01:11:35.421 --> 01:11:36.453
Why?

01:11:36.589 --> 01:11:39.342
Dirk and Stan were sophomores.

01:11:40.801 --> 01:11:43.293
They weren't up for the Hitchcock Award.

01:11:43.638 --> 01:11:45.181
So why kill them?

01:11:47.224 --> 01:11:49.551
I don't know what to do.

01:11:50.603 --> 01:11:52.146
I'm so scared.

01:11:54.732 --> 01:11:56.524
It's okay.

01:11:57.109 --> 01:11:58.735
I'm here now.

01:12:02.073 --> 01:12:03.153
Listen.

01:12:04.867 --> 01:12:07.074
We need to get some rest.

01:12:07.286 --> 01:12:10.407
Then we'll go to the tower
and start at the beginning.

01:12:10.581 --> 01:12:13.832
Until then, you need to go to sleep.
You're exhausted.

01:12:14.001 --> 01:12:17.003
- I know, but--
- You're exhausted.

01:12:23.260 --> 01:12:27.591
Maybe there's something we missed.
Something that will help us.

01:12:30.768 --> 01:12:33.437
Just don't leave me again, okay?

01:12:35.523 --> 01:12:37.066
I won't.

01:12:38.526 --> 01:12:39.772
I promise you.

01:15:11.721 --> 01:15:12.920
Vanessa.

01:15:20.896 --> 01:15:22.724
I got your note.

01:15:25.443 --> 01:15:28.813
Let me just tell you
how I felt when I read this.

01:15:29.405 --> 01:15:30.485
What?

01:15:30.990 --> 01:15:35.238
At first I was a little surprised,
but, you know, not really.

01:15:36.912 --> 01:15:38.491
But I--

01:15:42.251 --> 01:15:45.039
Vanessa, I didn't write a letter.

01:15:46.464 --> 01:15:47.627
What?

01:15:58.517 --> 01:15:59.633
Oh, God.

01:16:03.689 --> 01:16:05.101
Who would do this?

01:16:12.782 --> 01:16:14.063
Come on, come on!

01:16:31.217 --> 01:16:33.092
Amy, what's going on?

01:16:33.719 --> 01:16:35.594
What are we running from?

01:16:42.645 --> 01:16:44.270
What is it?

01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:49.312
What is it, Amy?

01:16:52.154 --> 01:16:53.614
Oh, shit.

01:16:59.537 --> 01:17:02.325
- Come on.
- Who the fuck's there?

01:17:02.665 --> 01:17:04.493
What the fuck's down there?

01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:06.294
Who is down there?

01:17:17.221 --> 01:17:18.467
Oh, rats.

01:17:30.818 --> 01:17:31.850
Come on!

01:17:34.947 --> 01:17:39.444
- What's going on? Is it a joke?
- No, it's not a joke.

01:17:41.370 --> 01:17:43.115
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

01:17:48.544 --> 01:17:50.372
What the fuck?

01:17:52.673 --> 01:17:54.299
I don't hear anything.

01:18:21.661 --> 01:18:23.868
Somebody help me!

01:18:52.274 --> 01:18:54.185
What the hell?

01:19:07.790 --> 01:19:09.369
What's wrong?

01:19:10.126 --> 01:19:11.669
It's Vanessa.

01:19:12.586 --> 01:19:14.794
- What?
- In the tower!

01:19:23.347 --> 01:19:25.839
Why weren't you there when I woke up?

01:19:25.975 --> 01:19:27.885
Amy. I found something.

01:19:28.227 --> 01:19:31.063
You've got to believe me.
Let's get out of here.

01:19:33.107 --> 01:19:34.816
So I got to thinking...

01:19:35.276 --> 01:19:39.025
...if the killer wasn't killing off
the competition for the Hitchcock...

01:19:39.113 --> 01:19:42.613
...but killing only film students,
there had to be a connection.

01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:44.195
But I couldn't find one.

01:19:44.285 --> 01:19:47.869
So then I took you out of the loop.

01:19:58.132 --> 01:20:03.175
My brother's thesis film project.
All the victims worked on it.

01:20:09.977 --> 01:20:11.009
Got it.

01:20:18.778 --> 01:20:21.483
That was just awful.

01:20:21.614 --> 01:20:24.153
How could Travis make
such a shitty movie?

01:20:28.371 --> 01:20:30.032
I think I saw something.

01:20:34.835 --> 01:20:36.959
- It's a splice.
- So?

01:20:54.230 --> 01:20:55.808
It's a hard splice.

01:20:55.940 --> 01:21:00.188
See, there's splicing tape
connecting the last frame of the film...

01:21:00.319 --> 01:21:02.776
...to the first frame of the credits.

01:21:02.863 --> 01:21:05.153
- That's not normal?
- No.

01:21:06.367 --> 01:21:08.610
This is a final print.

01:21:09.537 --> 01:21:12.622
It's a copy from a negative.
You shouldn't see splices.

01:21:12.707 --> 01:21:15.459
Somebody changed the credits
on Travis' film?

01:21:16.836 --> 01:21:21.499
Somebody changed the film
on Travis' credits.

01:21:22.383 --> 01:21:24.709
To pass it off as their own?

01:21:25.219 --> 01:21:28.672
There's one person on this crew
who's still alive.

01:21:31.475 --> 01:21:33.019
Oh, my God.

01:22:01.213 --> 01:22:03.207
Mayfield? What the--

01:22:07.428 --> 01:22:09.505
Okay, okay.

01:22:10.598 --> 01:22:12.010
What do you want?

01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:38.876
Travis.

01:22:43.297 --> 01:22:44.840
That should hold him.

01:22:45.216 --> 01:22:46.960
What's the matter, Toby?

01:22:48.761 --> 01:22:50.802
Looks like you've seen a ghost.

01:23:00.773 --> 01:23:02.517
Professor Solomon?

01:23:02.650 --> 01:23:04.857
Could you talk to them? They have a gun--

01:23:04.944 --> 01:23:06.225
Shut up!

01:23:10.658 --> 01:23:12.034
Travis?

01:23:13.119 --> 01:23:14.530
Professor.

01:23:14.787 --> 01:23:16.033
But I thought--

01:23:16.122 --> 01:23:19.124
Thank you for coming, Professor Solomon.

01:23:21.210 --> 01:23:22.789
I'm really sorry.

01:23:24.755 --> 01:23:26.832
Maybe you should sit down.

01:23:29.385 --> 01:23:31.343
Pull up a chair, Professor.

01:23:32.888 --> 01:23:34.467
What's with the gun?

01:23:38.644 --> 01:23:40.685
It's fake. It's a prop.

01:23:40.813 --> 01:23:42.095
Oh, my God.

01:23:44.025 --> 01:23:45.603
What's going on here?

01:23:45.943 --> 01:23:49.146
Toby stole my film
and switched the credits on it.

01:23:51.365 --> 01:23:55.660
Is that what this is all about?
Well don't flatter yourself.

01:23:56.287 --> 01:24:00.701
Back up a step. Travis, why the charade?
I thought you were dead.

01:24:00.791 --> 01:24:02.203
We'll get to that.

01:24:02.376 --> 01:24:04.749
Toby's film was falling apart.

01:24:04.837 --> 01:24:07.756
He knew mine was good
because he did the sound on it.

01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:12.420
No. I did not do the sound on your film,
you fake-suicide psycho.

01:24:12.595 --> 01:24:14.672
You did it. You know that.

01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:18.214
You gave me the credit
so I could graduate.

01:24:21.687 --> 01:24:23.348
You never saw his film?

01:24:23.439 --> 01:24:25.563
No. I never came near his film.

01:24:29.362 --> 01:24:31.688
Professor, help me out here.

01:24:32.323 --> 01:24:34.732
You realise what this means, don't you?

01:24:35.368 --> 01:24:36.364
What?

01:24:36.744 --> 01:24:39.366
I gave you an A in sound for nothing.

01:24:50.716 --> 01:24:52.710
Film's a collaborative medium.

01:24:53.010 --> 01:24:56.178
And who the fuck are you?

01:24:58.432 --> 01:25:00.675
I put a gun in Travis Stark's mouth.

01:25:01.477 --> 01:25:03.720
And I pulled the trigger.

01:25:07.733 --> 01:25:08.730
Why?

01:25:09.276 --> 01:25:10.606
Why?

01:25:10.861 --> 01:25:13.188
To frame you.

01:25:14.824 --> 01:25:16.402
As a matter of fact...

01:25:16.534 --> 01:25:20.449
...I need your prints on this gun
to prove you killed Toby and Travis...

01:25:20.538 --> 01:25:22.282
...and whoever this loser is.

01:25:24.542 --> 01:25:26.203
Trevor, is it?

01:25:27.878 --> 01:25:28.959
Cute.

01:25:35.094 --> 01:25:36.637
Run, Amy!

01:25:36.846 --> 01:25:37.843
Get up!

01:25:41.058 --> 01:25:43.633
If you don't get out here,
I'll shoot this guy!

01:25:44.937 --> 01:25:46.978
You want to die now, asshole?

01:25:57.491 --> 01:26:00.695
Get out here before you kill someone else.

01:26:12.506 --> 01:26:14.299
Amy, don't come out.

01:26:14.759 --> 01:26:19.137
Is it true about twins? Did you feel it
when I blew your brother's brains out?

01:26:19.347 --> 01:26:21.969
Guess it's going to hurt dying twice.

01:26:22.516 --> 01:26:24.095
Okay!

01:26:26.562 --> 01:26:27.808
Let him go.

01:26:29.649 --> 01:26:31.689
You got what you wanted.

01:26:31.859 --> 01:26:35.194
You think this is what I wanted?

01:26:36.197 --> 01:26:38.155
Fuck teaching!

01:26:38.783 --> 01:26:40.776
What are you talking about?

01:26:43.412 --> 01:26:45.572
When I was a student here...

01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:50.252
...the faculty was deadlocked
for the Hitchcock, between my film...

01:26:50.836 --> 01:26:53.245
...and a piece of shit by Chip Voelker.

01:26:53.547 --> 01:26:57.214
So they asked a guest filmmaker
to cast the deciding vote.

01:26:58.844 --> 01:27:02.012
Taylor Mayfield, documentary hack.

01:27:03.933 --> 01:27:05.594
With that one vote...

01:27:06.102 --> 01:27:10.017
...your father robbed me of the career
I should've had in Hollywood.

01:27:11.232 --> 01:27:13.938
And I've been trapped here ever since.

01:27:14.652 --> 01:27:15.851
But then...

01:27:17.113 --> 01:27:19.320
...Travis made a brilliant film.

01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:23.028
And I saw my way out.

01:27:23.411 --> 01:27:25.570
But, I needed an alibi.

01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:27.279
Then bingo.

01:27:27.498 --> 01:27:31.449
You walk in my office,
with that twisted little movie idea...

01:27:31.711 --> 01:27:34.084
...giving me the cover I needed.

01:27:34.213 --> 01:27:37.464
You killed everyone
who worked on Travis' film...

01:27:38.175 --> 01:27:41.012
...to pass it off as your own
and get away with it.

01:27:41.387 --> 01:27:43.048
Hey, babe. Whatever.

01:27:43.389 --> 01:27:45.846
While you end up in some lesbo prison...

01:27:45.933 --> 01:27:49.884
...I'll be heading to LA with Travis' film
and a three-picture deal.

01:27:50.604 --> 01:27:52.931
That only works in movies, idiot.

01:28:07.705 --> 01:28:09.615
- Freeze!
- Freeze!

01:28:11.042 --> 01:28:12.371
Oh, thank God.

01:28:12.710 --> 01:28:14.834
- They're trying to kill me.
- He's lying.

01:28:14.962 --> 01:28:16.374
First things first!

01:28:16.464 --> 01:28:20.379
I want the crazy-ass white girl
to drop the gun and kick it away!

01:28:20.509 --> 01:28:23.761
- But he's lying!
- I said drop it and kick it away!

01:28:33.147 --> 01:28:34.523
Thank you.

01:28:34.774 --> 01:28:38.819
Now, everyone out
of the creepy-ass graveyard!

01:28:42.990 --> 01:28:44.948
That includes the undead!

01:28:45.826 --> 01:28:47.737
Professor, drop the shovel.

01:28:48.746 --> 01:28:51.748
She's the one you saw
coming out of the tower.

01:28:51.832 --> 01:28:54.455
- Don't listen to him.
- Cross over to me, Professor.

01:28:54.543 --> 01:28:56.252
You're safe now.

01:28:58.297 --> 01:29:00.172
It's true, isn't it, Amy?

01:29:00.383 --> 01:29:03.052
I saw you leaving the tower.

01:29:04.011 --> 01:29:05.127
Listen.

01:29:06.889 --> 01:29:09.595
But I never told anyone I saw her.

01:29:14.313 --> 01:29:15.808
Motherfucker!

01:29:16.315 --> 01:29:18.605
You fucking son of a bitch!

01:29:26.450 --> 01:29:27.827
Watch out!

01:29:41.465 --> 01:29:43.710
Okay, everybody. Calm down!

01:29:54.729 --> 01:29:56.354
What do you say, hon?

01:29:56.981 --> 01:29:58.642
Give me your best shot.

01:30:00.651 --> 01:30:02.609
You filmed Sandra's death.

01:30:02.862 --> 01:30:05.270
It's called cinéma vérité.

01:30:05.823 --> 01:30:07.733
Nice touch, don't you think?

01:30:08.534 --> 01:30:10.077
It was out of focus.

01:30:11.495 --> 01:30:13.323
But you know what they say:

01:30:14.123 --> 01:30:17.042
"Those who can't do, teach."

01:30:35.853 --> 01:30:37.763
What are you going to do?

01:30:44.528 --> 01:30:46.855
Come on. Do it.

01:30:48.866 --> 01:30:50.196
Reese!

01:30:52.036 --> 01:30:53.412
Pass it to me.

01:31:00.544 --> 01:31:01.577
Amy!

01:31:02.546 --> 01:31:03.828
Oh, my God.

01:31:11.055 --> 01:31:12.467
Thank God.

01:31:22.483 --> 01:31:26.019
"That's my sister, baby.
She's a whole lot a woman."

01:31:29.573 --> 01:31:31.947
We need help at the film department.

01:31:34.704 --> 01:31:39.497
<i>It has been a year of pain
and tremendous loss.</i>

01:31:40.084 --> 01:31:44.035
<i>And our final award
is also tinged with sadness...</i>

01:31:44.255 --> 01:31:47.008
<i>...for its recipient is no longer with us.</i>

01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:50.885
<i>We are fortunate, however,
to have his brother here...</i>

01:31:50.970 --> 01:31:53.296
<i>...to accepton his behalf.</i>

01:31:54.348 --> 01:31:57.884
<i>We're proud to give
this year's Alfred Hitchcock Award...</i>

01:31:58.019 --> 01:32:01.969
<i>...in memory of Travis Stark
and</i> The Gods of Men.

01:32:21.375 --> 01:32:24.828
Freeze! You psycho motherfucker!

01:32:38.976 --> 01:32:40.222
And cut!

01:32:43.397 --> 01:32:47.348
- How many times we got to do this?
- Good. Print that.

01:32:47.902 --> 01:32:51.023
We're going to do this one more time.
Back to one.

01:32:52.198 --> 01:32:53.907
Let me give you a hand.

01:32:55.534 --> 01:32:57.908
Listen. I am Amy Mayfield's agent.

01:32:58.079 --> 01:33:00.950
We're not taking less
than a three-picture deal.

01:33:04.752 --> 01:33:07.588
- How am I doing?
- You're doing great.

01:33:07.755 --> 01:33:09.962
- You, too.
- Amy? Picture's up.

01:33:11.634 --> 01:33:14.470
All right, let's try it. And rolling.

01:33:17.223 --> 01:33:19.715
- Okay, let's get this.
- Soundspeed.

01:33:19.892 --> 01:33:23.345
<i>Urban Legends</i>, Scene 6, Take 2.
Mark it.

01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:34.073
Don't you just love that movie?

01:33:39.704 --> 01:33:42.243
I think we have a lot in common.
