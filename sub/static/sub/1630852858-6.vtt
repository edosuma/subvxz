00:39.706 --> 00:40.874
TOYODA GOLDFISH

01:01.352 --> 01:02.896
Why the hell are you bothering me?

01:02.979 --> 01:05.065
I was calling nonstop
and you didn't answer.

01:05.565 --> 01:07.525
You had an early morning interview.

01:07.609 --> 01:09.069
It's a pain in the ass.

01:09.569 --> 01:11.529
They keep asking me about Sakura.

01:12.030 --> 01:13.406
You still don't know where she is?

01:13.490 --> 01:15.575
I'm looking for her.

01:15.658 --> 01:18.119
We should talk future plans
if she won't be returning--

01:18.203 --> 01:20.038
I said I'm looking for her!

01:25.668 --> 01:27.170
Where the hell did she go?

01:35.094 --> 01:36.221
- Sakura.
- Yes?

01:36.304 --> 01:38.389
Can you handle the register after that?

01:38.473 --> 01:39.307
Okay.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.022
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

01:46.105 --> 01:48.441
Are you Sakura Hiraga by any chance?

01:51.236 --> 01:52.070
Yes.

01:52.153 --> 01:55.323
I thought so! I'm a huge fan of Takuya's.

01:55.907 --> 01:57.992
I'm an avid follower
of the salon's Instagram.

02:00.411 --> 02:01.246
Okay.

02:01.830 --> 02:05.250
Wow, I never thought
I'd meet you in place like this.

02:05.834 --> 02:08.294
But why are you here?

02:08.378 --> 02:11.548
Excuse me, could you prep the hair dye?
I'll take over here.

02:12.507 --> 02:15.009
- Sure.
- Do you work here?

02:15.635 --> 02:16.928
Thank you very much.

02:25.395 --> 02:29.899
Apparently, that girl used to run
a famous salon in Tokyo.

02:30.483 --> 02:33.153
She was upset
when a customer recognized her.

02:35.947 --> 02:39.200
But why come here to the countryside?

02:40.952 --> 02:44.330
I'm sure she has her reasons.

03:51.564 --> 03:53.274
I wonder how Dad's doing.

03:54.776 --> 03:57.612
- What?
- I wonder what he's up to?

04:00.198 --> 04:01.241
Who knows?

04:03.826 --> 04:06.037
He's probably so busy
he has no time to think

04:06.120 --> 04:07.747
about anything other than work.

04:12.752 --> 04:13.711
Mommy.

04:14.796 --> 04:15.672
What?

04:18.424 --> 04:21.010
I know your secret.

04:27.725 --> 04:31.229
What are you talking about?
Mommy doesn't have any secrets.

04:32.730 --> 04:35.733
- Okay.
- What a silly child.

04:35.817 --> 04:39.028
Hurry up and eat. You'll be late.

06:36.979 --> 06:37.980
What an expression.

06:40.108 --> 06:41.275
Why are you here?

06:41.359 --> 06:43.736
I came to check on you. Is that a crime?

06:43.820 --> 06:45.029
Please leave.

06:53.079 --> 06:54.497
This is where Sakura lives.

06:56.332 --> 06:58.417
Ran asked me to look it up.

06:59.210 --> 07:02.296
She learned the truth about the accident

07:02.922 --> 07:06.134
and feels she's behaved poorly
towards the person who saved her life.

07:10.680 --> 07:14.142
That's what you meant by,
"She's special," right?

07:21.524 --> 07:23.901
That still doesn't justify infidelity.

07:25.069 --> 07:28.322
But I made a promise to Ran,
so I pulled some strings to find her.

07:28.990 --> 07:29.866
Here you go.

07:33.953 --> 07:36.414
4659-10 MISAWA APARTMENTS, APT C,
KURAYAMA, FUJIOKA, GUNMA

07:43.421 --> 07:44.255
Hey, Hisako.

07:45.756 --> 07:47.467
You're looking radiant lately.

07:48.176 --> 07:51.762
- What?
- Yeah, now that you mention it.

07:52.346 --> 07:54.932
Are you perhaps having an affair?

08:01.689 --> 08:05.067
Ridiculous! I would never do that.

08:10.615 --> 08:11.991
Why are you so upset?

08:12.700 --> 08:14.702
You're the last person
on earth who would--

08:14.785 --> 08:15.912
It can't be, can it?

08:20.541 --> 08:21.834
I'm home.

08:24.378 --> 08:27.006
Mommy? Mommy, what's wrong?

08:28.591 --> 08:29.425
Hey!

08:30.134 --> 08:31.302
My head…

08:31.928 --> 08:34.305
Are you okay? Mommy?

08:34.889 --> 08:35.723
I'm okay.

08:37.058 --> 08:39.894
I just need to rest for a bit.
I'll be fine.

08:40.895 --> 08:41.812
Mommy!

08:42.522 --> 08:43.523
Mommy!

09:09.423 --> 09:11.884
Do you hate me now?

09:13.261 --> 09:15.471
No, it's not that.

09:17.348 --> 09:18.349
Even now…

09:19.725 --> 09:22.853
Hearing your voice
makes me want to rush over to you.

09:24.063 --> 09:26.566
Then why are you saying we shouldn't meet?

09:30.111 --> 09:32.113
People are getting suspicious.

09:32.905 --> 09:33.823
Like my son.

09:34.782 --> 09:35.616
What?

09:40.997 --> 09:43.624
We shouldn't continue doing this.

09:48.379 --> 09:49.463
Hisako…

09:50.798 --> 09:54.468
- I'm--
- Let's end this now. I'm sorry.

09:56.095 --> 09:57.013
Hello?

10:20.953 --> 10:21.954
SALON VILLAGE

10:22.038 --> 10:23.831
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

10:24.415 --> 10:25.708
See you soon.

10:36.636 --> 10:37.553
Excuse me.

10:46.687 --> 10:49.315
I'd like to ask you something.

11:01.410 --> 11:02.912
Are you all right?

11:03.454 --> 11:05.915
Yes, I'm fine. Sorry.

11:15.883 --> 11:18.344
Sakura, stay in the back office.

11:21.180 --> 11:22.014
Okay.

11:22.556 --> 11:25.142
This is this salon, isn't it?

11:28.187 --> 11:30.314
Excuse me, could you prep the hair dye?

11:31.524 --> 11:33.526
- Sure.
- Thank you.

11:37.363 --> 11:39.615
Yes, that's our shop.

11:40.199 --> 11:41.784
I'm searching for this person.

11:43.494 --> 11:44.453
Sakura?

11:45.329 --> 11:47.164
Yes, that's right.

11:48.082 --> 11:49.333
She's here, isn't she?

11:51.961 --> 11:54.046
Sakura has already quit.

11:56.340 --> 11:59.427
She suddenly said
she found work in another salon.

12:01.887 --> 12:02.721
Where is that?

12:03.514 --> 12:04.473
I don't know.

12:05.641 --> 12:07.059
I didn't ask.

12:08.018 --> 12:08.894
Well…

12:09.603 --> 12:13.065
I'm sorry I can't be of more use to you.

12:14.024 --> 12:14.859
Goodbye.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.742
Do you hate me now?

13:05.743 --> 13:09.205
I want to run to your side
just from hearing your voice.

13:09.288 --> 13:11.624
I know your secret, Mommy.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.502
We shouldn't continue doing this.

13:15.294 --> 13:18.130
Are you okay? Mommy? Mommy!

13:47.117 --> 13:48.494
I'm sorry,

13:50.204 --> 13:51.163
Yuta.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.120
How?

14:35.666 --> 14:36.917
Why is Baba here?

14:51.098 --> 14:54.310
As I thought. Mom doesn't remember you,
does she, Dad?

14:54.393 --> 14:56.270
It's called a dissociative disorder.

14:57.521 --> 15:02.151
When something bad happens,
you get amnesia to try to erase it.

15:02.818 --> 15:05.946
That can cause stress and headaches.
I read it on the Internet.

15:07.615 --> 15:09.408
It must be the shock of being cheated on.

15:09.491 --> 15:14.163
She's forgotten your face
and that she'd kicked you out.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.916
Mom's been odd lately.

15:17.666 --> 15:20.127
I know your secret.

15:20.210 --> 15:22.254
Mommy doesn't have any secrets.

15:22.338 --> 15:26.258
I tried to get her to fess up.
Something was suspicious.

15:26.342 --> 15:28.594
So I followed her and she was seeing you.

15:29.219 --> 15:30.346
I was surprised.

15:34.391 --> 15:35.225
I'm sorry.

15:38.062 --> 15:41.106
Mom's headaches
are getting worse and worse.

15:42.608 --> 15:43.442
Are they?

15:44.026 --> 15:47.404
She used to get migraines
when she was reminded of you,

15:47.488 --> 15:49.073
but would recover quickly.

15:49.156 --> 15:51.992
But yesterday she was in so much pain
that she couldn't get up.

15:55.913 --> 15:58.874
Hey, why don't you tell her the truth?

16:00.042 --> 16:01.043
What?

16:01.126 --> 16:05.130
It might cause her stress,
but it could jolt her memories back.

16:06.924 --> 16:08.425
No, we can't do that.

16:09.301 --> 16:11.679
If she knew the truth,
I couldn't see her again.

16:12.262 --> 16:13.764
So it's gonna be like this forever?

16:16.475 --> 16:18.435
You'll just keep watching us from afar,

16:19.728 --> 16:21.730
work so that you can send us money,

16:22.898 --> 16:24.650
and you'll never see Mom again.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.236
Are you okay with that?

16:31.615 --> 16:32.700
Because I'm not.

16:34.118 --> 16:36.745
I want to be with you and Mom,

16:37.329 --> 16:39.415
eating together and having fun.

17:18.370 --> 17:19.329
Hey.

17:21.749 --> 17:22.750
Hey, what's wrong?

17:32.134 --> 17:33.469
SEARCH

17:34.261 --> 17:38.223
GOLDFISH

17:43.312 --> 17:45.898
It's okay. It'll get better soon.

17:47.941 --> 17:49.068
I'm glad to hear that.

17:52.946 --> 17:54.281
Could it be…

17:55.365 --> 17:58.202
Is this goldfish from the summer festival
at the Fujihata Shrine?

17:59.036 --> 17:59.870
What?

18:00.954 --> 18:03.540
Incredible. You remember that?

18:04.500 --> 18:09.004
Yes, as I recall,
you were with your wife and son.

18:09.505 --> 18:11.381
I remember it well
because I took your photo.

18:13.342 --> 18:15.385
Are the other two fish doing well?

18:18.055 --> 18:19.389
I don't know.

18:24.311 --> 18:27.439
Actually, I was kicked out of the house.

18:28.482 --> 18:30.025
I'm on my own now.

18:30.567 --> 18:31.485
I see.

18:32.402 --> 18:36.031
When I left, I took one fish with me.

18:39.326 --> 18:40.577
I wonder why.

18:42.162 --> 18:44.832
Maybe as the only connection to my family.

18:45.541 --> 18:46.834
That's how I felt.

18:51.505 --> 18:52.923
Such a soppy story, isn't it?

18:54.675 --> 18:56.093
By the way, did you know?

18:56.802 --> 19:00.514
In Switzerland, it's against the law
to keep only one goldfish.

19:01.390 --> 19:04.810
They say it's because
goldfish are social creatures.

19:04.893 --> 19:07.104
I didn't know that.

19:07.938 --> 19:10.274
But I wonder if that's true.

19:10.774 --> 19:12.526
Yes, well,

19:13.402 --> 19:18.907
laws are made to serve humans,
so I don't know if it's right or wrong.

19:19.783 --> 19:20.742
But…

19:23.078 --> 19:25.122
What is a goldfish's happiness?

19:26.206 --> 19:28.250
When people are unable to consider that,

19:29.001 --> 19:31.003
it brings unhappiness to the goldfish.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.298
There's no doubt about that.

19:41.972 --> 19:42.973
Excuse me.

19:44.474 --> 19:45.434
Welcome.

19:53.525 --> 19:54.776
Baba…

19:55.903 --> 19:57.196
Why are you here?

19:57.779 --> 19:58.697
Well…

19:59.489 --> 20:02.075
Why are you here, Hisako?

20:03.493 --> 20:04.494
I…

20:12.044 --> 20:13.545
This picture…

20:14.963 --> 20:16.673
I thought I'd ask about it here.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.460
How is that possible?

20:55.671 --> 20:58.048
Why are you in the picture?

21:07.891 --> 21:09.101
Hisako.

21:11.436 --> 21:13.855
There's something I have to tell you.

21:19.027 --> 21:19.903
I…

21:22.364 --> 21:23.657
My name is not Baba.

21:26.243 --> 21:27.077
What?

21:29.121 --> 21:30.080
It's Taguchi.

21:31.623 --> 21:32.708
Takuzo.

21:34.751 --> 21:36.128
That's my name.

21:37.546 --> 21:38.672
I'm your…

21:41.508 --> 21:42.634
husband.

21:47.055 --> 21:48.432
What are you talking about?

21:49.808 --> 21:52.311
- My husband is away on business--
- He's not.

21:52.894 --> 21:54.313
Please, just hear me out.

21:55.939 --> 21:56.940
You have

21:58.442 --> 22:01.653
lost your memory of me.

22:05.240 --> 22:07.743
I did something awful and hurt you,

22:08.535 --> 22:09.911
and the stress from that…

22:13.665 --> 22:15.042
Something awful?

22:16.626 --> 22:17.836
What did you do?

22:22.215 --> 22:23.091
I…

22:26.720 --> 22:28.430
became involved with another woman.

22:32.225 --> 22:33.685
I had an affair.

22:39.066 --> 22:42.319
I used to live in the tower condo
with my family.

22:42.402 --> 22:45.155
But I was kicked out.
She found out I'd cheated.

22:46.615 --> 22:50.452
When we met by chance on the riverbed,
I was truly surprised.

22:50.535 --> 22:51.703
I'm sorry.

22:59.836 --> 23:03.632
What's more is that
you had no recollection of me.

23:03.715 --> 23:05.675
Have we met before?

23:05.759 --> 23:07.052
I'm a little surprised.

23:07.135 --> 23:10.555
She's not friendly with anyone
but my husband and my son.

23:11.807 --> 23:15.060
I was caught up in the moment
and lied to you.

23:15.602 --> 23:16.812
My name is Baba.

23:16.895 --> 23:19.606
Baba is the name
of the shipping company where I work.

23:19.689 --> 23:20.690
BABA SHIPPING

23:26.071 --> 23:30.033
I know that telling you this
is only making you more confused.

23:30.951 --> 23:31.827
But…

23:33.954 --> 23:34.830
But…

23:35.580 --> 23:38.041
I know I couldn't continue lying to you.

23:41.044 --> 23:42.796
Even if it meant not seeing you again.

23:44.464 --> 23:45.841
I wanted to tell you the truth.

23:48.135 --> 23:50.137
And tell you how I really feel.

23:54.766 --> 23:58.103
Why did you lie?

24:02.399 --> 24:04.109
Because I wanted to be with you.

24:09.781 --> 24:11.867
I wanted us to be together again.

24:19.166 --> 24:20.250
This is a photo

24:21.835 --> 24:24.713
of when the three of us went
to the summer festival.

24:27.549 --> 24:29.759
We played goldfish scooping together.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.305
Yuta caught one,

24:34.431 --> 24:35.974
and you caught two,

24:38.101 --> 24:40.187
and I couldn't catch any.

24:42.981 --> 24:44.274
Yuta said,

24:44.941 --> 24:48.737
"The fish are a family of three too!"
He was so happy.

24:55.911 --> 24:56.828
And so…

24:59.831 --> 25:01.791
we took this picture as a memento.

25:08.965 --> 25:09.883
I know.

25:10.842 --> 25:14.596
I don't expect you to accept my apology
after all that I've done to you.

25:17.349 --> 25:18.225
But…

25:21.853 --> 25:23.355
But sincerely…

25:25.899 --> 25:29.194
I am truly sorry for what I did.

25:37.494 --> 25:39.204
I don't understand…

25:41.790 --> 25:43.333
what's going on.

25:48.713 --> 25:49.547
But…

25:54.344 --> 25:55.345
My body…

25:57.555 --> 25:59.391
remembers you.

26:09.609 --> 26:10.568
Because…

26:13.697 --> 26:15.740
when you touched me,

26:19.286 --> 26:21.329
it felt so familiar.

26:37.679 --> 26:39.306
I didn't want to be apart.

26:41.766 --> 26:43.476
I've always yearned

26:44.936 --> 26:46.479
for us to be together.

26:55.780 --> 26:57.574
I may have forgotten everything.

27:03.872 --> 27:04.873
But I do think…

27:08.251 --> 27:10.837
that is how I genuinely feel.

27:35.153 --> 27:36.196
Here you are.

27:39.240 --> 27:41.743
I'm sorry for all the trouble.

27:41.826 --> 27:45.330
Not at all, I'm just happy
that the goldfish is feeling better.

27:49.876 --> 27:51.878
Still, I'm surprised
you remembered this shop.

27:53.922 --> 27:57.133
I thought I heard
the name "Toyoda" at the festival.

27:57.217 --> 27:58.802
I looked it up and saw your Instagram.

27:59.511 --> 28:02.389
Yeah, I found that too.

28:04.015 --> 28:05.058
Instagram…

28:07.560 --> 28:09.437
Are you really going to quit?

28:10.438 --> 28:11.689
I'm sorry.

28:13.108 --> 28:14.818
Because of that man?

28:19.406 --> 28:20.782
He's my husband.

28:22.617 --> 28:26.079
If I stay here,
I'll only cause you trouble.

28:27.747 --> 28:28.915
That's a shame.

28:34.087 --> 28:36.673
Come back anytime.

28:39.134 --> 28:43.179
- What?
- You're always welcome here.

28:43.930 --> 28:44.806
Okay?

28:48.476 --> 28:52.814
Take care of yourself.
Call us if you have any trouble.

28:52.897 --> 28:53.732
Yeah.

28:57.235 --> 28:58.069
Yes.

28:59.904 --> 29:01.197
Thank you so much.

29:22.510 --> 29:25.805
- We've had more female customers lately.
- Really?

29:25.889 --> 29:27.807
Where can I find this goldfish?

29:27.891 --> 29:29.142
GOLDFISH_OTAKU

29:41.613 --> 29:43.114
Saltwater bath.

29:43.198 --> 29:46.493
One liter of water and a teaspoon of salt.

29:47.243 --> 29:50.288
Zero point five percent of salt
feels great for the goldfish.

29:50.371 --> 29:51.915
It's like enhancement.

30:00.757 --> 30:04.761
When keeping a goldfish,
the most important thing is observation.

30:08.097 --> 30:11.476
What goldfish need most
is clean water. If you keep them…

30:11.559 --> 30:14.354
…in a small bowl,
change half the water every day.

30:14.437 --> 30:16.773
Hold on, that's a lot of work.

30:19.234 --> 30:21.820
Pairing goldfish
with other fish is tricky,

30:21.903 --> 30:24.906
because they're particular
about compatibility.

30:24.989 --> 30:28.326
I'm checking to see which breeds
like swimming together.

30:28.409 --> 30:29.577
They have compatibility?

30:42.799 --> 30:45.927
Even an injured goldfish
will come back to life,

30:46.427 --> 30:48.388
when you're able to genuinely care for it.

30:52.183 --> 30:53.643
I have to be more resilient.

30:56.104 --> 30:57.188
Like goldfish.

30:57.939 --> 30:59.065
I couldn't do it.

30:59.148 --> 31:03.111
I'm not strong enough to keep swimming.

31:16.416 --> 31:17.542
Thank you.

31:56.205 --> 31:57.582
Hard day at work?

32:03.004 --> 32:04.213
If you don't pay attention,

32:04.881 --> 32:07.300
you won't notice
if someone's following you.

32:09.052 --> 32:10.511
You should be more careful.

32:13.473 --> 32:14.974
Why are you here?

32:15.058 --> 32:17.143
Don't look so scared.

32:18.019 --> 32:19.812
I came to give you something,
then I'll go.

32:22.190 --> 32:23.191
Divorce papers.

32:24.776 --> 32:25.610
What?

32:26.611 --> 32:27.654
Let's talk.

32:45.964 --> 32:48.591
Well, such a humble living you have here.

32:50.718 --> 32:53.262
Remember when you used to
look down onto everyday life

32:53.346 --> 32:55.598
from the top floor of a luxury high-rise?

33:02.188 --> 33:04.190
Hey, do you hear me?

33:10.238 --> 33:14.075
I like this much better
than living in that apartment.

33:20.415 --> 33:24.293
I'm sorry for hitting you.
I feel bad about it.

33:26.295 --> 33:30.008
You must be lonely after breaking up
with that goldfish shop owner.

33:31.551 --> 33:33.803
Don't be stubborn, just come home.

33:35.221 --> 33:38.850
Everyone at the salon
is worried about you too.

33:40.768 --> 33:41.602
Okay?

33:44.480 --> 33:45.565
From now on,

33:47.233 --> 33:49.652
I'll take even better care of you.

33:50.570 --> 33:51.779
- So--
- Don't.

33:57.410 --> 33:58.828
Where are the divorce papers?

34:01.330 --> 34:02.498
You brought them, didn't you?

34:07.003 --> 34:08.880
I no longer want to live in fear of you.

34:10.339 --> 34:12.091
Unable to say what I want to say.

34:14.719 --> 34:17.388
Living every single day unable to breathe.

34:23.269 --> 34:24.520
I want a divorce.

34:34.030 --> 34:35.031
I see.

34:37.992 --> 34:39.202
Then let's die together.

34:40.828 --> 34:42.914
My life means nothing without you.

34:44.832 --> 34:46.501
Do you think that if you threaten me

34:47.585 --> 34:49.295
I'll do whatever you say?

34:53.758 --> 34:55.218
You wouldn't end your life.

34:56.719 --> 34:57.678
After all…

35:00.223 --> 35:02.391
you love yourself more than anything else.

35:07.647 --> 35:08.731
Watch your mouth!

35:09.273 --> 35:10.691
Don't get cocky!

35:13.486 --> 35:15.738
Hold it! Hey!

35:34.632 --> 35:36.259
Why can't you understand?

35:38.594 --> 35:40.263
I love you.

35:42.473 --> 35:43.891
The only thing you love…

35:46.018 --> 35:46.936
is yourself.

35:55.278 --> 35:56.612
What's with that look?

35:59.115 --> 36:01.242
- What's with that look!
- Stop!

36:01.826 --> 36:03.286
Stop!

36:05.163 --> 36:06.205
Stop!

36:14.297 --> 36:16.591
Please stop!

36:17.258 --> 36:18.384
No!
