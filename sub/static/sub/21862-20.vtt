08:52.083 --> 08:54.833
<c.speaker><i>F-F-F-Feliz Navidad, </i>y'all.

08:54.833 --> 08:56.708
<c.speaker>Oh, it's just you.

08:56.708 --> 08:59.750
<c.speaker>Someone needs
to put a bit more
<i>feliz </i>in their <i>Navidad. </i>

08:59.750 --> 09:01.583
<c.speaker>Princess Elena!

09:01.583 --> 09:03.208
<c.speaker>I brought you
a little somethin'-somethin'.

09:03.208 --> 09:04.708
<c.speaker>Oh, thanks, Luna.

09:04.708 --> 09:06.875
<c.speaker>Want to join us
for <i>Nochebuena? </i>

09:06.875 --> 09:08.875
<c.speaker>[laughs] Please?

09:08.875 --> 09:12.000
<c.speaker>Oh, I'd love to, but the snow
is just getting worse.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
<c.speaker>If I'm gonna make it to
Vallestrella, I gotta go now.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.875
<c.speaker>You mind getting the door,
Chancellor Sourpuss?

09:15.875 --> 09:16.750
<c.speaker>Hmm!

09:16.750 --> 09:19.416
<c.speaker>See ya. Ohhh! Unh!

09:19.416 --> 09:20.458
<c.speaker>Ooh!

09:20.458 --> 09:22.500
<c.speaker>Luna! Are you okay?!

09:22.500 --> 09:24.125
<c.speaker>Do I look okay?

09:24.125 --> 09:25.875
<c.speaker><i>Llévaluq! </i>

09:25.875 --> 09:27.750
<c.speaker>Oh! Whew!

09:27.750 --> 09:29.583
<c.speaker>While you're at it,
why don't you make a spell

09:29.583 --> 09:31.000
<c.speaker>to stop all this snow?

09:31.000 --> 09:33.291
<c.speaker>Why didn't
I think of that?!

09:33.291 --> 09:35.000
<c.speaker>I agree! Why didn't you?

09:35.000 --> 09:36.208
<c.speaker>Get moving!

09:36.208 --> 09:38.583
<c.speaker>[Esteban]
What is taking so long?!

09:38.583 --> 09:40.083
<c.speaker>Ooh! Here's a spell!

09:40.083 --> 09:43.375
<c.speaker>Wait a second,
it's a double-hit spell.

09:43.375 --> 09:45.250
<c.speaker>I have to bang
the tamborita twice.

09:45.250 --> 09:46.833
<c.speaker>Oh, there's more.

09:46.833 --> 09:49.000
<c.speaker>Yes, yes, hit it twice!
Bang-bang, let's go!

09:49.000 --> 09:50.583
<c.speaker>Okay, okay!

09:50.583 --> 09:52.708
<c.speaker>Unh! Yeow! Unh!

09:52.708 --> 09:56.291
<c.speaker>Stop fooling around
and do the spell!

09:56.291 --> 09:58.750
<c.speaker><i>-Cepayák yamanák! </i>
-[bang bang]

10:05.708 --> 10:07.958
<c.speaker>Mateo! You made it worse!

10:07.958 --> 10:09.458
<c.speaker>I don't understand.

10:11.708 --> 10:12.750
<c.speaker>[panting]

10:14.000 --> 10:15.875
<c.speaker>[groans]

10:15.875 --> 10:18.000
<c.speaker>We need to take shelter.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.750
<c.speaker>There's a cave over there!

10:25.833 --> 10:28.083
<c.speaker>[Vestia] Whoa! Whoa!

10:28.083 --> 10:29.708
<c.speaker>Was your magic spell

10:29.708 --> 10:31.875
<c.speaker>supposed to get <i>us </i>caught
in the storm, too?

10:31.875 --> 10:34.208
<c.speaker>If you could fly
as fast as you complain,

10:34.208 --> 10:36.583
<c.speaker>it wouldn't be
a problem, beast!

10:36.583 --> 10:39.583
<c.speaker>I told you
we have names, wizard.

10:39.583 --> 10:41.708
<c.speaker>And we've had enough
of you two.

10:43.375 --> 10:46.166
<c.speaker>-Oh!
-Aaah!

10:47.375 --> 10:49.000
<c.speaker>[Cruz] Ha ha! <i>Adiós! </i>

10:49.000 --> 10:50.625
<c.speaker>[annoyed groan]

10:50.625 --> 10:53.375
<c.speaker>Why'd you have to keep
insulting him like that?

10:53.375 --> 10:54.583
<c.speaker>It doesn't matter.

10:54.583 --> 10:55.750
<c.speaker>We are not far.

10:55.750 --> 10:57.833
<c.speaker>We will walk
the rest of the way.

11:00.875 --> 11:02.583
<c.speaker>Ow! Ay!

11:03.625 --> 11:05.708
<c.speaker>Ow! Ay! Papá!

11:05.708 --> 11:07.583
<c.speaker>Mija!

11:07.583 --> 11:09.875
<c.speaker>I can't walk.

11:14.125 --> 11:15.333
<c.speaker>[grunting]

11:15.333 --> 11:17.583
<c.speaker>Then I will walk
for both of us.

11:23.125 --> 11:25.833
<c.speaker>[breathing heavily]

11:32.500 --> 11:34.875
<c.speaker>[straining]

11:37.000 --> 11:38.875
<c.speaker>Papá! Look!

11:42.333 --> 11:45.875
<c.speaker>We made it! We're home!

11:45.875 --> 11:47.875
<c.speaker>[gasp] Papá.

11:49.625 --> 11:51.875
<c.speaker>Someone's been living here.

11:54.291 --> 11:56.708
<c.speaker>[sigh] Dad's
marziberry cookies

11:56.708 --> 11:59.166
<c.speaker>-are probably getting colder...
-[tapping head on window]

11:59.166 --> 12:02.000
<c.speaker>and colder... and colder.

12:04.875 --> 12:06.750
<c.speaker>[moans]

12:06.750 --> 12:09.333
<c.speaker>Okay, this calls
for drastic measures.

12:09.333 --> 12:11.166
<c.speaker>Everybody up. Up up up!

12:12.708 --> 12:14.000
<c.speaker>I've been holding
out all day

12:14.000 --> 12:15.583
<c.speaker>for my favorite
<i>Navidad </i>tradition,

12:15.583 --> 12:17.416
<c.speaker>but since the snow's
not letting up...

12:17.416 --> 12:19.958
<c.speaker>who wants to make tamales?

12:19.958 --> 12:22.291
<c.speaker>Tamales? Without <i>Abuela? </i>

12:24.458 --> 12:25.958
<c.speaker>I could use a bite.

12:25.958 --> 12:28.375
<c.speaker>It's better than
sitting around moping.

12:31.500 --> 12:34.708
<c.speaker>I guess we won't be home
for <i>Navidad </i>after all.

12:37.458 --> 12:39.250
<c.speaker>[gasp]

12:39.250 --> 12:40.625
<c.speaker>Okay, squad, listen up!

12:40.625 --> 12:43.416
<c.speaker>We may be stuck here
for <i>Nochebuena, </i>

12:43.416 --> 12:45.958
<c.speaker>but that doesn't mean
we can't celebrate.

12:45.958 --> 12:48.833
<c.speaker>So who'd like
some sweet <i>buñuelos? </i>

12:48.833 --> 12:50.083
<c.speaker>Hmm?

12:50.083 --> 12:52.708
<c.speaker>Those are crackers, Captain.

12:52.708 --> 12:56.291
<c.speaker>Mmm. Tastes
like a <i>buñuelo </i>to me.

12:57.708 --> 13:00.416
<c.speaker>Oh. I'll take one.

13:00.416 --> 13:01.708
<c.speaker>Me, too.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.833
<c.speaker>[sips]

13:04.833 --> 13:07.291
<c.speaker>You know, I swear this water
tastes like <i>ponche navideño. </i>

13:07.291 --> 13:10.000
<c.speaker>[laughing]

13:12.250 --> 13:13.750
<c.speaker>[sniffs]

13:13.750 --> 13:16.083
<c.speaker>Mm, smells like <i>Navidad. </i>

13:16.083 --> 13:18.333
<c.speaker>[both]
<i>Feliz Navidad, </i>Captain.

13:18.333 --> 13:20.458
<c.speaker><i>Feliz Navidad. </i>

13:22.083 --> 13:25.250
<c.speaker>Okay, you each know
what you need to do.

13:25.250 --> 13:28.000
<c.speaker>So let's make tamales!

13:30.625 --> 13:32.375
<c.speaker>Uh! Mateo!

13:32.375 --> 13:34.125
<c.speaker>What? I wasn't ready yet.

13:34.125 --> 13:37.083
<c.speaker>Come on. You can move
quicker than that!

13:37.083 --> 13:39.208
<c.speaker>[Elena] Uh, what's
the rush, Esteban?

13:39.208 --> 13:41.750
<c.speaker>The sooner we cook,
the sooner we eat.

13:41.750 --> 13:43.291
<c.speaker>-Now give me the twine.
-Oh!

13:43.291 --> 13:44.875
<c.speaker>Where is it?

13:44.875 --> 13:46.583
<c.speaker>Luna!

13:46.583 --> 13:48.000
<c.speaker>What?!

13:48.000 --> 13:49.583
<c.speaker>Ah! Forget the twine!

13:49.583 --> 13:51.000
<c.speaker>No, wait, you need
to tie them...

13:51.000 --> 13:52.458
<c.speaker>first!

13:52.458 --> 13:54.625
<c.speaker>Ay! No! [sigh]

13:54.625 --> 13:55.833
<c.speaker>[gasp] My twine!

13:55.833 --> 13:57.833
<c.speaker>[all gasping and groaning]

13:59.000 --> 14:00.083
<c.speaker>-[splat]
-Ooh!

14:04.500 --> 14:05.875
<c.speaker>-He did it.
-He did it.
-She did it.

14:08.083 --> 14:11.000
<c.speaker>You know,
if you think about it, Elena,

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
<c.speaker>it is actually your fault

14:13.000 --> 14:16.166
<c.speaker>for allowing
unqualified people
to make the tamales.

14:16.166 --> 14:19.958
<c.speaker>My fault? I was just trying
to cheer you guys up!

14:19.958 --> 14:20.958
<c.speaker>You were?

14:20.958 --> 14:22.250
<c.speaker>Yes!

14:22.250 --> 14:24.000
<c.speaker>That's all
I've been doing all day.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.458
<c.speaker>Coming up with idea after idea
to lift your holiday spirits.

14:29.833 --> 14:31.125
<c.speaker>[sigh]

14:31.125 --> 14:33.000
<c.speaker>And you didn't even notice.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.333
<c.speaker>Well done, everyone,
well done!

14:39.333 --> 14:41.708
<c.speaker>You ruined Elena's <i>Navidad. </i>

14:41.708 --> 14:44.875
<c.speaker>Us? You were the one
making us go too fast.

14:44.875 --> 14:46.750
<c.speaker>Yeah!
And you bumped into me!

14:46.750 --> 14:48.875
<c.speaker>Yes, because
the jaquin tripped me!

14:48.875 --> 14:50.458
<c.speaker>Oh, sure,
blame the jaquin.

14:50.458 --> 14:53.166
<c.speaker>No! This is
all your fault, Esteban.

14:53.166 --> 14:55.125
<c.speaker>You've been grouchy all day.

14:55.125 --> 14:56.333
<c.speaker>And bossier than ever.

14:56.333 --> 14:58.458
<c.speaker>Rushing us to do this
and cook that.

14:58.458 --> 15:01.000
<c.speaker>Do you care about anyone
besides yourself?

15:01.000 --> 15:03.875
<c.speaker>Yes, I care
about my <i>abuelos! </i>

15:03.875 --> 15:05.083
<c.speaker>And Isabel!

15:05.083 --> 15:06.458
<c.speaker>And I have been
worried about them

15:06.458 --> 15:08.333
<c.speaker>since the moment
the storm hit.

15:08.333 --> 15:11.125
<c.speaker>But they just went
to Cristina's village.

15:11.125 --> 15:13.708
<c.speaker>[sigh]
You do not understand.

15:13.708 --> 15:16.375
<c.speaker>I lost my parents
in a storm.

15:17.708 --> 15:20.166
<c.speaker>I was a boy,
younger than Isabel.

15:20.166 --> 15:23.583
<c.speaker>My parents left on a voyage
across the great ocean.

15:23.583 --> 15:25.625
<c.speaker>I told them not to go.

15:25.625 --> 15:29.250
<c.speaker>I had a bad feeling,
but they would not listen.

15:29.250 --> 15:32.083
<c.speaker>There was a sudden blizzard
over the Northern Seas.

15:32.083 --> 15:34.958
<c.speaker>Their ship went down.

15:36.583 --> 15:39.500
<c.speaker>No one survived.

15:39.500 --> 15:42.708
<c.speaker>And now my <i>abuelos  </i>
are out there, with Isabel.

15:42.708 --> 15:45.166
<c.speaker>They are all the family
I have left.

15:47.291 --> 15:48.458
<c.speaker>I'm sorry, Esteban.

15:48.458 --> 15:50.208
<c.speaker>That's terrible.

15:50.208 --> 15:53.833
<c.speaker>But ya know, you still got
family right here in the palace.

15:53.833 --> 15:55.750
<c.speaker>And you haven't been
treating her right.

15:56.875 --> 15:58.458
<c.speaker>None of us have.

16:01.083 --> 16:03.708
<c.speaker>We owe her an apology.

16:03.708 --> 16:07.333
<c.speaker>No. We owe her
much more than that.

16:09.250 --> 16:12.125
<c.speaker>[strumming guitar]

16:12.125 --> 16:14.458
<c.speaker>[knock on door]

16:22.583 --> 16:23.708
<c.speaker>Mmm!

16:25.875 --> 16:28.250
<c.speaker>"When your friends
have made you blue,

16:28.250 --> 16:30.583
<c.speaker>a simple 'sorry'
just won't do.

16:30.583 --> 16:33.625
<c.speaker>So here's
a treasure hunt for you.

16:33.625 --> 16:36.583
<c.speaker>On the back
is your first clue."

16:36.583 --> 16:39.125
<c.speaker>"I began my path of magic

16:39.125 --> 16:43.125
<c.speaker>where my new robe's fit
was tragic."

16:43.125 --> 16:47.291
<c.speaker>Hmm. Mateo got his new robe
when I made him Royal Wizard...

16:47.291 --> 16:49.250
<c.speaker>[gasp] in the Throne Room!

16:51.708 --> 16:54.625
<c.speaker>"When it was time
for my big bash,

16:54.625 --> 16:57.083
<c.speaker>you helped me
make a bigger splash.

16:57.083 --> 16:58.875
<c.speaker>This is
where I learned to dance

16:58.875 --> 17:01.166
<c.speaker>and turned
into a fancy-pants."

17:01.166 --> 17:03.250
<c.speaker>Oh, Naomi.

17:03.250 --> 17:04.875
<c.speaker>[gasp] The Music Room!

17:07.875 --> 17:10.291
<c.speaker>"When I was sick
and stuck in bed

17:10.291 --> 17:12.708
<c.speaker>without the strength
to lift my head,

17:12.708 --> 17:15.166
<c.speaker>you brought me soup
from way down here

17:15.166 --> 17:18.458
<c.speaker>and made this Chancellor's
symptoms clear."

17:21.125 --> 17:23.166
<c.speaker>[all] Surprise!

17:23.166 --> 17:27.000
<c.speaker>We cannot let
a few little hiccups
dampen our holiday spirit.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.750
<c.speaker>So would you do us
the honor, Elena?

17:29.750 --> 17:32.125
<c.speaker>Absolutely!

17:34.625 --> 17:37.458
<c.speaker>Part of the fun
is making them together.

17:38.458 --> 17:39.583
<c.speaker>Luna!

17:41.208 --> 17:43.000
<c.speaker>Now they're
ready to steam.

17:44.458 --> 17:46.250
<c.speaker>I'm sorry about before.

17:46.250 --> 17:49.375
<c.speaker>I was so anxious,
I was rushing everyone.

17:49.375 --> 17:52.833
<c.speaker>You, Naomi, Mateo.

17:52.833 --> 17:55.875
<c.speaker>[gasp]
Yes, you <i>were </i>rushing me!

17:55.875 --> 17:57.500
<c.speaker>Well, you do
not have to rub it in.

17:57.500 --> 18:00.291
<c.speaker>Not with the tamales,
with my spell!

18:00.291 --> 18:03.208
<c.speaker>It says here,
on a double-hit spell,

18:03.208 --> 18:06.958
<c.speaker>you have to bang the tamborita
after each word.

18:06.958 --> 18:08.416
<c.speaker>But I was rushing,

18:08.416 --> 18:11.458
<c.speaker>and I think I hit
the drum too fast.

18:11.458 --> 18:12.375
<c.speaker><i>-Cepayák! </i>
-[bang]

18:12.375 --> 18:13.708
<c.speaker><i>-Yamanák! </i>
-[bang]

18:18.958 --> 18:20.583
<c.speaker>-Viva, Mateo!
-Bravo!

18:20.583 --> 18:22.000
<c.speaker>Here comes the sun!

18:22.000 --> 18:24.500
<c.speaker>Mmm! You saved <i>Navidad. </i>

18:24.500 --> 18:28.333
<c.speaker>Which means
you can all go home
to your families.

18:33.208 --> 18:36.708
<c.speaker>Y'know, I'm not
in that huge a rush.

18:36.708 --> 18:39.416
<c.speaker>And there's no way I'm leaving
until I've had a <i>tamal. </i>

18:39.416 --> 18:41.416
<c.speaker>Yeah, I'm
not going anywhere soon.

18:41.416 --> 18:44.333
<c.speaker>No family should be
apart on <i>Navidad. </i>

18:44.333 --> 18:48.458
<c.speaker>Perhaps all your families can
come to the palace to celebrate.

18:48.458 --> 18:51.000
<c.speaker>Nothing would make me
happier, cousin.

18:56.833 --> 18:59.583
<c.speaker>I've never seen
a storm clear so fast.

18:59.583 --> 19:01.458
<c.speaker>All right,
we better mount up

19:01.458 --> 19:03.208
<c.speaker>and see if we can pick up
Victor and Carla's trail.

19:03.208 --> 19:05.250
<c.speaker>It'll be nightfall soon.

19:07.583 --> 19:09.208
<c.speaker>[Francisco] We're home!

19:09.208 --> 19:11.291
<c.speaker>[gasp] It's a party!

19:11.291 --> 19:12.291
<c.speaker><i>Abuelo! </i>

19:12.291 --> 19:13.875
<c.speaker><i>Abuelo?! Abuela! </i>

19:13.875 --> 19:15.583
<c.speaker>Ha ha!

19:16.625 --> 19:18.458
<c.speaker>Ahh.

19:18.458 --> 19:21.250
<c.speaker>And our very own
<i>Navidad </i>angel.

19:21.250 --> 19:22.291
<c.speaker>[giggles]

19:22.291 --> 19:24.000
<c.speaker>Oh, <i>primo. </i>

19:24.000 --> 19:26.875
<c.speaker>[sniffs]
Are those tamales I smell?

19:26.875 --> 19:29.875
<c.speaker>Yeah. We were waiting,
but then--

19:31.833 --> 19:33.416
<c.speaker>Mmm.

19:33.416 --> 19:35.625
<c.speaker>Just the way
I taught you!

19:35.625 --> 19:38.416
<c.speaker>[relieved sigh]

19:38.416 --> 19:40.208
<c.speaker>This calls for a toast!

19:40.208 --> 19:44.250
<c.speaker>To Elena. The keeper
of our <i>Navidad </i>spirit.

19:44.250 --> 19:46.583
<c.speaker>This calls
for more than a toast.
