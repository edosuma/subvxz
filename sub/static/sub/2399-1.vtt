Yes.

JANE: Then why didn't you
stay at Oxford?

04:19.551 --> 04:21.678
Because my finals exams
were such a shambles,

04:21.762 --> 04:24.766
that the examiners,
they summoned me
in for a viva,

04:24.848 --> 04:26.225

if I got a second...

04:26.308 --> 04:27.434
What's a viva?

04:27.976 --> 04:31.105
Oh, it's a sort of mildly
terrifying face-to-face thingy.

04:31.188 --> 04:33.407
Like an interview?
An interrogation.

04:34.065 --> 04:36.693
And I told them that if they
gave me a second-class degree,

04:36.777 --> 04:39.451
then I would stay with them
and do my research at Oxford.

04:39.529 --> 04:42.203
But if they gave me
the first that I needed
to get into Cambridge,

04:42.282 --> 04:44.910
then they would never
have to see me again.

04:46.161 --> 04:48.163

You had some reservations

Yes.

Yeah.

40:26.841 --> 40:29.390
So, Stephen,
in summary, um,

40:29.469 --> 40:32.143
as we know, chapter one,
full of holes, uh,

40:33.473 --> 40:35.646
lacks mathematical support.

40:35.892 --> 40:39.522
Professor Thorne?
Chapter two, not really original.

40:39.812 --> 40:41.485
Uses a lot of Roger's ideas.

40:41.814 --> 40:43.987
Well, at least
you run with them.

40:44.692 --> 40:48.071
Uh, chapter three, too many
unanswered questions.

40:48.237 --> 40:49.284
SCIAMA: I agree.

40:49.364 --> 40:51.913
And then, of course,
we have chapter four.

40:51.991 --> 40:54.835
This black hole at
the beginning of time.

40:55.244 --> 40:57.463

Indeed.

40:58.706 --> 41:01.926
It's brilliant.
Brilliant, Stephen.

41:02.710 --> 41:04.087
Superb.

41:04.379 --> 41:07.132
Therefore, all there is
to say is well done.

41:07.674 --> 41:09.426
Or perhaps I should say,
to be more precise,

41:09.509 --> 41:11.227
well done, Doctor.

41:11.386 --> 41:12.763

So, black holes

black at all,

with heat radiation.

50:16.430 --> 50:19.434

of heat energy

to lose mass

and eventually they disappear
in a spectacular explosion.

that a black hole

is, indeed,
losing particles

50:44.291 --> 50:47.340

it will evaporate, it will...

Stephen, Jane was telling me

01:04:34.037 --> 01:04:35.289
Um...

01:04:36.039 --> 01:04:38.508
That proves that
the universe, um,

01:04:38.583 --> 01:04:40.460
had a beginning.
Is that it?

01:04:43.296 --> 01:04:46.846
That was my PhD thesis.

01:04:49.135 --> 01:04:53.436

believe in the creation?

is irrelevant in physics.

Stephen's done a U-turn.

01:05:16.704 --> 01:05:20.208
The big new idea is that the
universe has no boundaries at all.

01:05:20.875 --> 01:05:23.048
No boundaries,
no beginning.

01:05:23.128 --> 01:05:25.130
And no God. Oh.

01:05:26.214 --> 01:05:29.309
Oh, I see. I... (CHUCKLES)
I thought that, um,

01:05:29.384 --> 01:05:33.389
you'd proved the universe
had a beginning
and thus a need for a creator.

01:05:34.514 --> 01:05:36.016
(CHUCKLES) My mistake.

01:05:36.433 --> 01:05:39.152
No, mine.

01:05:42.397 --> 01:05:43.899
Stephen is looking
for a single theory

01:05:43.982 --> 01:05:46.531
that explains all the
forces in the universe.

01:05:47.527 --> 01:05:49.575
Therefore, God must die.

01:05:49.779 --> 01:05:52.157
Oh, uh, why must God die?
I don't see.

01:05:53.158 --> 01:05:55.786
The two great pillars
of physics

01:05:56.244 --> 01:05:58.463
are quantum theory,

01:05:58.746 --> 01:06:02.876
the laws that govern
the very small particles,
electrons and so on,

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:05.883
and general relativity.

01:06:06.212 --> 01:06:07.680
Ah, yes, Einstein.

01:06:08.173 --> 01:06:09.265
Einstein's theory,
the laws that govern

01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:11.138
the very large planets
and such.

01:06:11.217 --> 01:06:14.312
But quantum and relativity...

01:06:14.387 --> 01:06:16.389
Don't tell me.
They're different?

01:06:16.931 --> 01:06:19.559
They don't remotely
play by the same rules.

01:06:20.393 --> 01:06:24.114
If the world were all
potatoes, then, easy.

01:06:24.189 --> 01:06:26.908
You could trace
a precise beginning

01:06:26.983 --> 01:06:28.735

into the menu,

01:06:36.868 --> 01:06:38.415
well, then it all
goes a little...

It just all becomes
a godless mess.
Oh, dear.

01:06:46.211 --> 01:06:48.088
(CHUCKLING)
Einstein hated peas.

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:53.511
Quantum theory. He said,
"God doesn't play dice
with the universe."

01:06:54.135 --> 01:06:57.435
STEPHEN: Seems
he not only plays dice,

01:06:58.264 --> 01:07:02.940
but he throws them
where we can't find them.

01:07:03.436 --> 01:07:06.656

Teaching and playing.

01:08:11.629 --> 01:08:14.633
Not really as a career,
but I'm not very ambitious.

01:08:14.716 --> 01:08:16.434

01:08:22.515 --> 01:08:24.813
Is that a sin?
I don't know.

01:08:26.728 --> 01:08:29.231
Wrong man to ask.

01:08:35.194 --> 01:08:36.992

for having me.

It was really, really wonderful.

I can do to be of service,

01:08:43.368 --> 01:08:44.416

01:08:44.495 --> 01:08:46.839

I mean, I would

01:08:46.913 --> 01:08:48.631
consider it a privilege.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.300

or commitments, so...

01:08:53.296 --> 01:08:56.550
I only mean that
if I could be of help,

01:08:57.091 --> 01:08:59.059
I believe I might
find a purpose that would

01:08:59.135 --> 01:09:01.809

um, situation. (CHUCKLES)

If someone is prepared
to offer it,

01:10:03.241 --> 01:10:05.539
I won't object.
