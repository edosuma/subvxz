<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

00:04.408 --> 00:05.908
We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.478 --> 00:09.746
<i>When you're burned,</i>
<i>you've got nothing --</i>

00:09.813 --> 00:12.014
<i>no cash, no credit,</i>
<i>no job history.</i>

00:12.082 --> 00:14.417
<i>You're stuck in whatever city</i>
<i>they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:14.485 --> 00:16.285
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:16.353 --> 00:19.088
<i>You do whatever work</i>
<i>comes your way.</i>

00:19.156 --> 00:21.157
<i>You rely on anyone</i>
<i>who's still talking to you.</i>

00:22.192 --> 00:23.659
<i>A trigger-happy girlfriend...</i>

00:23.727 --> 00:25.294
Should we shoot them?

00:25.362 --> 00:27.096
<i>...an old friend who used</i>
<i>to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

00:27.164 --> 00:29.866
You know spies --
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:29.933 --> 00:32.235
<i>...family, too...</i>
<i>Hey, is that your mom again?</i>

00:32.302 --> 00:34.170
<i>...if you're desperate....</i>
<i>Someone needs your help, Michael.</i>

00:34.238 --> 00:37.306
<i>...and a down-and-out spy</i>
<i>you met along the way.</i>

00:37.374 --> 00:38.941
That's how we do it,
people.

00:39.009 --> 00:41.611
<i>Bottom line --</i>
<i>as long as you're burned,</i>

00:41.678 --> 00:43.479
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

00:47.618 --> 00:49.619
I know where
we can find Anson Fullerton.

00:49.686 --> 00:50.787
Excuse me?

00:50.854 --> 00:51.854
He's picking up
a package tomorrow

00:51.922 --> 00:53.422
in a motel
in Atlantic City.

00:54.425 --> 00:56.592
Nate, you're the only one
who can get to Anson

00:56.660 --> 00:58.394
before he escapes.

01:00.264 --> 01:02.298
Get up. Get up!

01:02.366 --> 01:04.534
- We got him, man.
- It is about time.

01:07.805 --> 01:10.206
Nate!

01:10.274 --> 01:12.008
No! Hey!

01:12.075 --> 01:13.242
Nate!

01:18.682 --> 01:20.716
I just -- I just --
I know he's busy.

01:20.784 --> 01:23.252
I just want to talk to him
about the investigation

01:23.320 --> 01:24.787
into my brother's murder.

01:24.855 --> 01:26.923
<i>As a spy,</i>
<i>you get used to dealing</i>

01:26.990 --> 01:28.724
<i>with government bureaucracy.</i>

01:28.792 --> 01:31.194
<i>If you need</i>
<i>to requisition a weapon,</i>

01:31.261 --> 01:33.830
<i>get an interrogation log</i>
<i>to an analyst,</i>

01:33.897 --> 01:37.467
<i>or even arrange an emergency</i>
<i>evac from a hostile territory,</i>

01:37.534 --> 01:39.969
<i>a bureaucrat</i>
<i>can be your best friend.</i>

01:40.037 --> 01:42.305
It is about the status
of the case.

01:42.372 --> 01:43.673
<i>But when you need</i>
<i>a simple answer</i>

01:43.740 --> 01:45.208
<i>to a straightforward question,</i>

01:45.275 --> 01:48.544
<i>that same bureaucrat</i>
<i>can become your worst enemy.</i>

01:48.612 --> 01:52.615
No, I don't want to
leave <i>another</i> message!

01:52.683 --> 01:54.083
Hello? Hello?!

01:56.687 --> 02:00.590
I take it that the FBI stiff
on the other end of the line

02:00.657 --> 02:02.124
wasn't very helpful.

02:02.192 --> 02:03.426
You have no idea.

02:03.494 --> 02:05.061
I'm sorry I woke you.

02:05.128 --> 02:07.797
You didn't.

02:07.865 --> 02:09.899
I'm not much of a late sleeper
these days.

02:09.967 --> 02:11.868
I guess I'm still
on a prison schedule.

02:11.935 --> 02:14.003
You haven't been
getting much rest, either.

02:14.071 --> 02:15.404
Just got a lot
on my mind.

02:15.472 --> 02:17.840
The FBI will find
whoever killed Nate.

02:17.908 --> 02:19.275
It just might
take a while.

02:19.343 --> 02:20.643
It has been a month, Fi.

02:20.711 --> 02:23.713
And I've heard nothing
about how the case is going.

02:23.780 --> 02:26.082
So, start an investigation
of your own.

02:26.149 --> 02:27.884
I will help you.
No. No, Fi.

02:27.951 --> 02:29.952
You are not
getting anywhere near this.

02:30.020 --> 02:31.821
We don't know
where this is gonna end,

02:31.889 --> 02:33.656
and I'm not
losing anyone else!

02:33.724 --> 02:35.258
I appreciate
your concern.

02:35.325 --> 02:36.359
Fi.

02:36.426 --> 02:37.860
I can take care
of myself.

02:37.928 --> 02:39.161
Just let me
deal with it.

03:09.660 --> 03:11.827
I need a word.
I'm Michael Westen.

03:11.895 --> 03:14.897
I know who you are.

03:14.965 --> 03:16.198
Look,
I know you're anxious

03:16.266 --> 03:17.567
to find out what happened
to your brother.

03:17.634 --> 03:20.169
All I can say is
the investigation is ongoing.

03:22.205 --> 03:24.173
I need a little more
than that.

03:26.977 --> 03:28.144
Are you threatening me?

03:28.211 --> 03:29.245
No.

03:29.313 --> 03:31.347
I just need you
to tell me

03:31.415 --> 03:34.317
everything you know
about this case.

03:34.384 --> 03:36.819
Listen to me
very carefully.

03:36.887 --> 03:39.522
I'm gonna walk away.
So are you.

03:39.590 --> 03:41.524
I don't think so.

03:41.592 --> 03:46.195
Tell me everything you know
about my brother's murder.

03:46.263 --> 03:48.631
There's nothing
to tell!

03:48.699 --> 03:50.099
File's closed.

03:50.167 --> 03:51.901
Case was shut down.

03:51.969 --> 03:53.202
What?

03:53.270 --> 03:54.837
We were
working the case,

03:54.905 --> 03:57.907
then we get word brass
wants to put a lid on it.

03:57.975 --> 04:00.109
No explanation --
just end the thing.

04:00.177 --> 04:01.911
You think I was
happy about it?

04:03.847 --> 04:05.147
Do we have
a problem here?

04:09.353 --> 04:12.355
No, there's no problem.

04:12.422 --> 04:13.856
I was just leaving.

04:15.325 --> 04:16.892

04:28.294 --> 04:30.037
Hey, look who's
not in jail.

04:30.039 --> 04:31.640
Well, I just got an earful
from Langley

04:31.707 --> 04:32.807
about your little stunt.

04:32.875 --> 04:34.242
What the hell
were you thinking

04:34.310 --> 04:36.111
threatening an FBI agent
like that?

04:36.178 --> 04:37.445
I didn't
threaten him.

04:37.513 --> 04:40.615
I asked him questions
with a gun in my hand --

04:40.683 --> 04:43.551
a gun I have the right
to legally carry.

04:43.619 --> 04:45.453
I did
what I had to do.

04:45.521 --> 04:47.689
I'm getting nowhere
playing Mr. Nice.

04:47.757 --> 04:50.325
At least I now know
the investigation is dead.

04:50.393 --> 04:52.861
A full investigation
into Nate's death

04:52.928 --> 04:54.229
would embarrass
a lot of people.

04:54.296 --> 04:56.164
That explains why they took
the case from the Agency.

04:56.232 --> 04:57.999
They never wanted to
get to the bottom of it.

04:58.067 --> 04:59.200
Why didn't you tell me
you were doing this?

04:59.268 --> 05:00.135
I could have
backed you up.

05:00.202 --> 05:01.269
Trust me.

05:01.337 --> 05:02.871
It wouldn't have
made any difference.

05:02.938 --> 05:05.540
Whatever leads the FBI had
are now in a sealed case file.

05:05.608 --> 05:07.308
Yeah, about that.

05:07.376 --> 05:09.110
Uh, I did some poking
around the FBI.

05:09.178 --> 05:11.212
Turns out a buddy of a buddy
at the bureau

05:11.280 --> 05:13.014
might be willing
to share that file,

05:13.082 --> 05:14.616
you know,
on the D.L.,

05:14.684 --> 05:17.619
but the guy wants our
help on another case in return.

05:17.687 --> 05:18.953
What's the case?

05:19.021 --> 05:21.389
Well, the FBI has been
looking for this guy,

05:21.457 --> 05:23.625
Brian "The Butcher" Quinn,
for awhile.

05:23.693 --> 05:25.994
He ran the Dorchester Hill Gang
up in Boston

05:26.062 --> 05:27.429
before he
went on the lam.

05:27.496 --> 05:29.631
It's all the good stuff --
drugs, gambling, murder.

05:29.699 --> 05:31.599
Then the FBI finally
caught a break.

05:31.667 --> 05:33.735
They tracked down Quinn's
right-hand man,

05:33.803 --> 05:36.004
James "Jimmy Boy" Leary,
right here in Miami.

05:36.072 --> 05:37.505
Let me guess.

05:37.573 --> 05:39.474
They think Quinn must be hiding
under some rock close by.

05:39.542 --> 05:40.642
Yeah. Bingo.

05:40.710 --> 05:42.310
Now, my FBI guy is gonna
pick Jimmy up,

05:42.378 --> 05:45.113
and he wants our help getting
Quinn's location out of him.

05:45.181 --> 05:46.648
I mean,
the guy is desperate.

05:46.716 --> 05:48.583
He's got a witness
at North Miami General Hospital.

05:48.651 --> 05:49.984
The guy's
on his last legs.

05:50.052 --> 05:52.053
If you can get that FBI file
on Nate's murder,

05:52.121 --> 05:53.521
I can run down leads
with Jesse.

05:53.589 --> 05:55.356
Tell your buddy I'm in.

06:01.964 --> 06:04.032
So, you two got some way
to help me out?

06:04.100 --> 06:06.201
'Cause, um,
I am running out of time.

06:08.804 --> 06:11.239
That your witness?
Yeah.

06:11.307 --> 06:12.440
Yeah. Kelly Duke.

06:12.508 --> 06:14.609
That's Quinn's
former number two...

06:14.677 --> 06:17.679
and my last hope
at finding that S.O.B.

06:17.747 --> 06:19.948
He's got less than a week
at most,

06:20.015 --> 06:22.784
and if he dies,
my case dies along with him.

06:22.852 --> 06:24.419
Now, I flew him down here
from Boston

06:24.487 --> 06:25.687
so the minute I find Quinn,

06:25.755 --> 06:27.288
he takes the stand here
in Miami.

06:27.356 --> 06:30.158
Now, that only happens
if you find Quinn.

06:30.226 --> 06:31.960
I think your best shot
is to arrest me

06:32.027 --> 06:33.862
along with Jimmy
and then let us escape.

06:33.929 --> 06:35.363
I'll get him to take me
to Quinn.

06:35.431 --> 06:37.799
Wait. Escape?

06:37.867 --> 06:40.068
Mike's gonna be wearing
a tracker the whole time.

06:40.136 --> 06:41.870
Look, you want to
find Quinn fast,

06:41.937 --> 06:43.805
that's the way to do it.

06:48.110 --> 06:50.645
Fine. All right,
when do we start?

06:50.713 --> 06:52.580
It starts as soon as I get
the FBI file

06:52.648 --> 06:54.215
on my brother's
murder investigation.

07:04.260 --> 07:08.229
For a file this big,
there's not much here.

07:08.297 --> 07:10.532
No prints, no suspects.

07:10.599 --> 07:12.767
Looks like the FBI
didn't get very many leads

07:12.835 --> 07:13.868
on Nate's murder.

07:13.936 --> 07:16.471
You have any luck?

07:16.539 --> 07:18.773
I think
perhaps maybe yes.

07:18.841 --> 07:20.041
The ballistics report

07:20.109 --> 07:22.210
says the sniper rifle
used to kill Nate

07:22.278 --> 07:24.045
was made by
Meyerson Industries.

07:24.113 --> 07:25.880
If we find that gun,
that'd be a good start.

07:25.948 --> 07:27.949
We're not even supposed to
be investigating the case.

07:28.017 --> 07:29.818
We can't just ask them
who they sold their gun to.

07:29.885 --> 07:31.085
Well, not directly,

07:31.153 --> 07:32.387
but there are other ways
to get information.

07:32.454 --> 07:33.655
Like?

07:33.722 --> 07:35.356
Blackmail.

07:35.424 --> 07:36.791
Just hear me out.

07:36.859 --> 07:38.159
There's a definite
angle here.

07:38.227 --> 07:40.662
The V.P. of sales
is the son of the founder.

07:40.729 --> 07:42.363
That's
a blackmailer's dream.

07:42.431 --> 07:43.698
Okay?

07:43.766 --> 07:45.867
He's a country-club member,
he's got a society wife,

07:45.935 --> 07:47.936
and he loves to,
you know, par-tay.

07:48.003 --> 07:49.871
Yeah, but setting up a play
like that could take time.

07:49.939 --> 07:51.272
I'm way ahead of you.

07:51.340 --> 07:54.175
He's gonna be an at industry
conference in Jacksonville.

07:54.243 --> 07:56.211
I'll head up there,
get all buddy-buddy with him,

07:56.278 --> 07:58.313
take him out clubbing,
snap a few racy photos --

07:58.380 --> 07:59.714
he'll tell me
about the gun.

07:59.782 --> 08:01.382
I'm not sure I could
talk my way out of that one

08:01.450 --> 08:02.584
if the C.I.A.
ever found out.

08:02.651 --> 08:04.219
Right.
I said, "I," not "we."

08:04.286 --> 08:05.520
I'd be
doing it alone.

08:05.588 --> 08:07.455
No, you wouldn't.
You'd need support.

08:07.523 --> 08:09.123
I could always
attend the conference

08:09.191 --> 08:10.592
on some other
agency business.

08:10.659 --> 08:12.493
It's way too risky. No.
Jesse.

08:12.561 --> 08:14.362
You guys were there for me
when I needed it.

08:14.430 --> 08:16.764
I said I wouldn't forget,
and I haven't.

08:16.832 --> 08:18.733
I'll have plane tickets
and cover I.D.s in the morning.

08:27.443 --> 08:29.010
What do you think?

08:29.078 --> 08:31.312
It's my first Boston mobster.

08:31.380 --> 08:32.647
I want to get it right.

08:32.715 --> 08:34.716
You look great,
but I still don't think

08:34.783 --> 08:36.217
you need to be
front and center on this.

08:36.284 --> 08:37.418
Last I checked,

08:37.486 --> 08:38.720
you needed a driver
for this job,

08:38.787 --> 08:39.821
and since Sam
can't do it...

08:39.889 --> 08:41.188
There's other ways
you can help.

08:41.256 --> 08:42.289
So I can't get hurt.

08:42.357 --> 08:44.058
I didn't say that.
Yeah, you did.

08:44.126 --> 08:46.761
In fact, you've said it
a couple of times now.

08:46.829 --> 08:48.963
There's no reason for you
to take unnecessary risks.

08:49.031 --> 08:50.398
Why don't you let me
decide that?

08:50.466 --> 08:52.200
If you're trying to prove
how tough you are...

08:52.268 --> 08:54.102
I'm not trying to
prove anything.

08:54.169 --> 08:56.337
We still don't know what kind of
situation we're walking into.

08:56.405 --> 08:57.705
When do we ever?

08:57.773 --> 08:59.807
When has that
ever mattered?

08:59.875 --> 09:02.810
Since Nate died!

09:10.819 --> 09:13.655
Look, I know
you feel responsible

09:13.722 --> 09:15.924
for what happened
to Nate.

09:15.991 --> 09:17.091
You're not.

09:17.159 --> 09:21.296
He volunteered
for this mission

09:21.363 --> 09:24.265
because he wanted to do
something worthwhile,

09:24.333 --> 09:27.035
something good,
because that's who he was.

09:27.102 --> 09:29.671
Because he was a Westen.

09:34.843 --> 09:36.911
I'm gonna do this
because it's who I am.

09:36.979 --> 09:38.313
It's because of
who we are.

09:38.380 --> 09:39.647
And you can't change that.

09:39.715 --> 09:40.915
I'll wait for you outside.

09:53.028 --> 09:54.495
Okay, Jimmy boy's
in there --

09:54.563 --> 09:56.464
in the 40-footer
with the dinghy on top.

09:56.532 --> 09:57.832
I got local P.D.
ready to pick him up

09:57.900 --> 09:59.467
and a surveillance team
ready to trail the two of you.

09:59.535 --> 10:00.868
No, you won't be
tailing us.

10:00.936 --> 10:03.237
I can't risk Jimmy
spotting any law enforcement

10:03.305 --> 10:04.405
once we're on the run.

10:04.473 --> 10:05.473
Great.

10:05.541 --> 10:06.874
We'll have the tracker.

10:06.942 --> 10:08.076
Which is
working like a dream.

10:08.143 --> 10:10.511
Just
follow the little dot.

10:10.579 --> 10:12.347
You sure Jimmy's not gonna
see that thing?

10:12.414 --> 10:14.082
Well, not unless
he's got X-ray vision.

10:14.149 --> 10:15.883
I mean, that thing's buried
in Mike's belt buckle.

10:15.951 --> 10:16.884
You ready, Mike?

10:16.952 --> 10:18.219
Let's do it.

10:26.662 --> 10:29.030
Okay, let's take this
son of a bitch now.

10:39.141 --> 10:41.442
That's the best you got?
A gun charge?

10:41.510 --> 10:42.744
I'll beat this rap by dinner.

10:45.848 --> 10:47.648
Oh, look who's
hosting the party.

10:47.716 --> 10:49.384
Agent Woods,
what a surprise.

10:49.451 --> 10:51.452
Yeah, good to see you,
too, Jimmy boy.

10:51.520 --> 10:52.720
Yeah, it's déjà vu all over.

10:52.788 --> 10:54.722
That's French for
"talk to my lawyer,"

10:54.790 --> 10:55.857
just like last time.

10:55.924 --> 10:56.958
You trust me.

10:57.026 --> 10:57.925
It will be different
this time.

10:57.993 --> 10:59.093
Doyle, scoot over.

10:59.161 --> 11:00.128
Oh, no can do, boss.

11:00.195 --> 11:01.596
My ass
took a wicked snooze.

11:01.663 --> 11:03.698
Think you could kiss it
and wake it up for me?

11:06.035 --> 11:07.335
That wake it up?

11:07.403 --> 11:09.270
Yeah, it did.

11:09.338 --> 11:11.472
Come on.

11:13.475 --> 11:15.276
Don't go anywhere, you two.

11:15.344 --> 11:16.744
We'll be right back.

11:16.812 --> 11:18.880
Yeah, we'll be waiting
on pins and needles for you.

11:20.315 --> 11:22.016
Good job, guys.

11:22.084 --> 11:23.951
You're Jimmy, right?

11:24.019 --> 11:26.587
Name's Robbie Doyle.

11:26.655 --> 11:28.623
I got to get
a message to Quinn.

11:28.690 --> 11:30.191
Got to make it fast.

11:30.259 --> 11:32.126
Quinn?
Don't ring a bell.

11:32.194 --> 11:33.528
Look, we don't got to
play this game

11:33.595 --> 11:34.495
with each other,
all right?

11:34.563 --> 11:35.596
Everybody knows --

11:35.664 --> 11:36.864
Do me a favor --
shut up.

11:36.932 --> 11:38.900
I'll do you that favor.
I'll shut up.

11:42.571 --> 11:44.038
Hope you two
are comfortable back there.

11:44.106 --> 11:46.074
Got a nice two-hour ride
to federal detention.

12:05.727 --> 12:07.528
What the hell
you keep looking at?

12:09.832 --> 12:11.165
That's my girlfriend,
Dawn, behind us.

12:11.233 --> 12:13.968
I think she's gonna
bust us out.

12:14.036 --> 12:15.603
Hey.

12:15.671 --> 12:17.638
Hey, don't be stupid.
You don't want to do that.

12:17.706 --> 12:21.109
You're gonna be giving the feds
an airtight charge, okay?

12:21.176 --> 12:22.944
You just lawyer up,
shut your mouth.

12:23.011 --> 12:24.245
Trust me.

12:24.313 --> 12:26.481
Like I said, I got
an urgent message for Quinn.

12:26.548 --> 12:28.316
You know, the guy
who don't ring a bell?

12:32.788 --> 12:34.789
<i>Whether you're trying to</i>
<i>run someone off the road</i>

12:34.857 --> 12:36.457
<i>or just trying to sell</i>
<i>that you are,</i>

12:36.525 --> 12:39.627
<i>it all comes down to</i>
<i>the vehicle you use to do it.</i>

12:39.695 --> 12:41.863
Okay. Here we go.
<i>You want a light frame</i>

12:41.930 --> 12:43.498
<i>so you can maneuver faster</i>
<i>than your target...</i>

12:46.602 --> 12:47.902
You don't want to do this.
Too late.

12:47.970 --> 12:49.637
Brace yourself.
This is gonna hurt.

12:49.705 --> 12:52.140
<i>and a low center of gravity</i>
<i>so you don't flip.</i>

12:55.911 --> 12:57.245
<i>Choosing the right car</i>

12:57.312 --> 13:00.581
<i>can mean the difference</i>
<i>between a clean stop...</i>

13:00.649 --> 13:02.917
<i>and a nasty spill.</i>

13:30.012 --> 13:32.046
Oh!

13:32.114 --> 13:34.715
And you wanted me
to stay home and do nothing. Hm!

13:36.185 --> 13:37.652
Oh, there.

13:37.719 --> 13:39.387
That's what I've been
waiting to see.

13:39.454 --> 13:40.388
Nice driving, hon.

13:40.455 --> 13:41.622
Hey, Jimmy, you coming?

13:41.690 --> 13:42.990
Feds are gonna try
to pin this on you.

13:43.058 --> 13:44.292
You might as well
go while you can.

13:45.961 --> 13:48.229
No? Fine.

13:48.297 --> 13:50.932
Good luck explaining
that this wasn't your idea.

13:50.999 --> 13:52.700
You're not getting away
with this, Jimmy,

13:52.768 --> 13:53.701
so don't even try.

13:55.437 --> 13:58.673
Stay put, Mr. FBI man,
or I'll blow your head off.

13:58.740 --> 14:00.408
Hey, wait up!

14:13.441 --> 14:16.009
Suspects last seen
heading north on Pine Road.

14:16.109 --> 14:17.676
All units respond immediately.

14:17.744 --> 14:20.546
Well, it looks like we got
a pretty big party started.

14:20.613 --> 14:23.582
Well, they're setting up
road blocks all around the area.

14:23.650 --> 14:25.884
I sure hope your boy Michael
knows what the hell he's doing.

14:25.952 --> 14:27.419
Relax.

14:27.487 --> 14:30.022
The tracker says they're getting
to the motel right about now.

14:30.089 --> 14:32.791
Should have ears on them
any second.

14:34.861 --> 14:37.529
So, where's Quinn?

14:37.597 --> 14:38.797
We don't have
much time.

14:38.865 --> 14:40.332
Cops are swarming
like roaches.

14:40.400 --> 14:41.500
I got to
find him now.

14:41.568 --> 14:43.302
Slow down.
Who are you?

14:43.369 --> 14:44.670
And what just happened?

14:44.737 --> 14:45.871
Who am I?

14:45.939 --> 14:48.207
I'm, like,
a snitch but for our side.

14:48.274 --> 14:50.742
I got some cops up in Boston
on the payroll.

14:50.810 --> 14:52.144
I hear things from them,

14:52.212 --> 14:54.513
and then I sell that information
to guys who need it,

14:54.581 --> 14:57.049
and I got some grade-A
information for your pal Quinn.

14:57.116 --> 14:58.317
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

14:58.384 --> 15:00.219
A couple of guys
up in Boston

15:00.286 --> 15:03.021
said that I could
get to Quinn through you.

15:03.089 --> 15:04.857
I'm guessing one of them
must have blabbed

15:04.924 --> 15:06.325
because the feds
nabbed both of us.

15:07.861 --> 15:09.661
Lucky for me, Dawn wanted to
see the sunshine state.

15:09.729 --> 15:11.063
Me and Robbie
are like a team.

15:11.130 --> 15:14.766
Even though sometimes
he don't like to admit it.

15:14.834 --> 15:17.035
You say you got information.
What is it?

15:17.103 --> 15:20.239
I know where the feds
are hiding the son of a bitch

15:20.306 --> 15:21.640
that ratted on Quinn.

15:21.708 --> 15:23.542
You're talking about Duke?

15:23.610 --> 15:24.676
Yeah. Duke.

15:24.744 --> 15:26.311
So I got to talk
to your boss, like, now.

15:26.379 --> 15:27.813
So where is he?
No, no, no.

15:27.881 --> 15:29.248
That ain't
the way it works.

15:29.315 --> 15:31.450
You tell me where Duke is
and I'll take care of the rest.

15:31.517 --> 15:32.918
Yeah.

15:32.986 --> 15:34.286
No offense there,
but if I tell you,

15:34.354 --> 15:35.721
nothing stops you
from cutting me out.

15:35.788 --> 15:37.689
What, you think
I'm taking you to Quinn?

15:37.757 --> 15:38.857
I just met you.

15:38.925 --> 15:40.359
Are you saying
you don't trust us?

15:40.426 --> 15:42.861
Busting you out
ain't enough?

15:42.929 --> 15:45.297
Forget it, Robbie.

15:45.365 --> 15:47.232
Let's get out of here
before the cops come knocking.

15:47.300 --> 15:48.901
This ungrateful skid
ain't worth the trouble.

15:48.968 --> 15:49.868
Sure.

15:49.936 --> 15:51.270
Jimmy can explain to Quinn

15:51.337 --> 15:53.305
how we gift-wrapped Duke
up in a bow,

15:53.373 --> 15:55.474
but instead of
putting him under a tree,

15:55.541 --> 15:57.075
Jimmy sent him
back to Santa.

15:57.143 --> 15:59.511
Hey, hey. All right.
All right. Fine.

15:59.579 --> 16:02.414
I'll make a call,
set up a meet.

16:02.482 --> 16:03.782
Okay.
You hear that?

16:03.850 --> 16:05.517
Sounds like Quinn's about to
crawl out of whatever hole

16:05.585 --> 16:06.451
he's been hiding in.

16:17.096 --> 16:19.464
Want one last look at the file
before you approach Meyerson?

16:19.532 --> 16:20.399
No, I'm good.

16:21.701 --> 16:23.168
The man is the link to
identifying Nate's murderer.

16:23.236 --> 16:24.670
We can't
screw this up.

16:24.737 --> 16:27.005
How hard could it be to convince
him to have a few drinks?

16:27.073 --> 16:28.273
He's a party animal,
remember?

16:32.712 --> 16:33.912
Better get a move on.

16:33.980 --> 16:35.814
Looks like he's not staying
for happy hour.

16:35.882 --> 16:37.382
Okay.

16:37.450 --> 16:40.919
It's time to get our friend
drunk, frisky, and compromised.

16:40.987 --> 16:43.055
Observe.

16:43.122 --> 16:45.090
<i>As far as cold approaches go,</i>

16:45.158 --> 16:47.526
<i>there's nobody spies</i>
<i>would rather deal with</i>

16:47.593 --> 16:48.760
<i>than salespeople.</i>

16:48.828 --> 16:50.929
<i>They're talkative,</i>
<i>eager to please,</i>

16:50.997 --> 16:52.798
<i>and most meet too many people</i>
<i>in a given year</i>

16:52.865 --> 16:54.333
<i>to remember them all.</i>

16:56.336 --> 16:57.970
Oh, excuse me.
I'm s--

16:58.037 --> 17:00.739
No!

17:00.807 --> 17:03.642
My God.
Meyerson, you son of a bitch.

17:03.710 --> 17:05.743
How you doing, man?
It's good to see you.

17:05.811 --> 17:07.212
You --
you don't remember me.

17:07.280 --> 17:08.914
You d-- Mark.

17:08.982 --> 17:10.482
Mark Thompson.

17:10.550 --> 17:12.818
Atlanta convention.
Crazy, crazy night.

17:12.885 --> 17:14.486
You bought me a drink.
You know what?

17:14.554 --> 17:15.753
I'm gonna
return the favor.

17:15.821 --> 17:17.021
I'm gonna buy you
some drinks right now.

17:17.089 --> 17:18.323
No, sorry.
I can't.

17:18.391 --> 17:20.425
I'm, uh, feeling a little
under the weather, Mark.

17:20.492 --> 17:23.028
I'm gonna try to sleep it off
before tonight's meetings.

17:23.096 --> 17:23.962
Thanks for the offer,
though.

17:24.030 --> 17:25.464
Yeah, yeah.

17:25.531 --> 17:27.499
<i>And no matter what</i>
<i>a salesman has going on...</i>

17:27.567 --> 17:29.001
No, it's cool.

17:29.068 --> 17:30.802
I'll just -- I'll call your
purchasing guy on Tuesday.

17:30.870 --> 17:32.971
<i>...they can't bear to offend</i>
<i>a potential customer.</i>

17:33.039 --> 17:35.507
You're a buyer?

17:35.575 --> 17:37.676
I do all the contracting work
with the Pentagon.

17:37.744 --> 17:39.011
We talked
about this, man.

17:39.078 --> 17:40.579
You seriously
don't remember me?

17:40.646 --> 17:41.913
No, no, no, no.

17:41.981 --> 17:43.015
Of course I do.

17:43.082 --> 17:44.182
Mark!
Mark!

17:44.250 --> 17:45.183
Okay!

17:45.251 --> 17:46.451
Just a drink.

17:46.519 --> 17:48.420
I'll introduce you
to some of my sales guys.

17:48.488 --> 17:51.023
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

17:51.090 --> 17:53.325
When I owe a man a drink,
I owe a man a drink,

17:53.393 --> 17:55.494
and we're not getting it
at the hotel bar.

17:55.561 --> 17:56.795
You understand me?
You're coming with me, buddy.

17:56.863 --> 17:57.729
What --
nope, nope.

17:57.797 --> 17:59.464
It's go time.

18:02.935 --> 18:04.336
<i>Setting up a blackmail</i>

18:04.404 --> 18:06.638
<i>is about more</i>
<i>than knocking your target out</i>

18:06.706 --> 18:09.174
<i>and snapping pictures</i>
<i>of things he won't remember.</i>

18:09.242 --> 18:10.742
<i>It starts much earlier,</i>

18:10.810 --> 18:12.544
<i>with all the things</i>
<i>he</i> will <i>remember.</i>

18:14.313 --> 18:16.815
<i>You need to make sure that</i>
<i>by the time you knock him out,</i>

18:16.883 --> 18:19.985
<i>he's ready to actually believe</i>
<i>that he did anything.</i>

18:23.489 --> 18:25.223
So glad
I ran into you, Mark.

18:25.291 --> 18:26.291
Yeah, what are
the chances, right?

18:29.328 --> 18:30.962
Crap. What's up?
What's wrong?

18:31.030 --> 18:32.164
It's my secretary.

18:32.231 --> 18:34.099
I've got a sales meeting
in a half-hour.

18:34.167 --> 18:35.200
No.
I should go.

18:35.268 --> 18:36.468
No, you don't.

18:36.536 --> 18:38.303
No, no, no! You're gonna
miss the best part. No.

18:38.371 --> 18:39.604
Excuse me, ma'am.

18:39.672 --> 18:41.339
Yes, you.
Yes, you.

18:41.407 --> 18:42.407
With the -- yes.

18:42.475 --> 18:45.343
My buddy here
would like to have

18:45.411 --> 18:48.180
a, uh, closer look
at your goods.

18:48.247 --> 18:50.749
Thank you very much.

18:50.817 --> 18:53.985
Yes!

18:54.053 --> 18:55.387
<i>Once it's time</i>
<i>to spike your target's drink,</i>

18:55.455 --> 18:57.923
<i>the important thing</i>
<i>is to control the dose.</i>

18:59.058 --> 19:00.926
You better
get in there.

19:00.993 --> 19:03.061
<i>Mix too much sedative</i>
<i>with alcohol</i>

19:03.129 --> 19:05.097
<i>and you shut down</i>
<i>the part of the brain</i>

19:05.164 --> 19:06.865
<i>that controls</i>
<i>the heart and lungs,</i>

19:06.933 --> 19:09.134
<i>which means your target</i>
<i>won't be sleeping.</i>

19:09.202 --> 19:10.102
<i>He'll be dead.</i>

19:10.169 --> 19:11.436
All right, man.

19:11.504 --> 19:18.577
A toast to new business,
old friends, and strippers!

19:18.644 --> 19:19.611
Hell, yes.

19:19.679 --> 19:20.579
Hell, yes!

19:23.316 --> 19:24.583
Whoo!

19:24.650 --> 19:28.220
I think it's time
for a little V.I.P. treatment.

19:28.287 --> 19:29.921
One lappy -- one song,

19:29.989 --> 19:31.022
and you're on your way,
I promise.

19:31.090 --> 19:32.591
Come on.
Sure, why not?

19:32.658 --> 19:33.925
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

19:33.993 --> 19:36.394
Do not
go easy on him!

19:36.462 --> 19:37.462
Go!

19:37.530 --> 19:40.098
Yes!

19:46.205 --> 19:47.372
Yeah, Jesse?

19:47.440 --> 19:49.007
Hey. All systems go.

19:49.075 --> 19:51.843
Looks like Meyerson's about to
have the afternoon of his life.

19:51.911 --> 19:52.978
All set here.

19:53.045 --> 19:54.846
His love den's ready
and wired for sound.

19:54.914 --> 19:56.715
You know what?
That's a good thing.

19:56.782 --> 19:59.451
I think we might be heading back
sooner than we thought.

20:01.154 --> 20:03.255
Cop cars are crawling
all over the place.

20:03.322 --> 20:04.856
When do I
get to see Quinn?

20:04.924 --> 20:06.825
We've been here
for hours.

20:06.893 --> 20:09.594
How much longer
are we gonna have to wait?

20:09.662 --> 20:11.196
As long as it takes.

20:12.665 --> 20:14.833
Well, it might not be
for much longer.

20:14.901 --> 20:17.135
Yeah.

20:17.203 --> 20:19.504
Yeah, okay.
I'll tell them.

20:21.240 --> 20:23.408
You're going to see Quinn.

20:23.476 --> 20:25.010
Great.
What's the address?

20:25.077 --> 20:26.211
I'll go now.

20:26.279 --> 20:27.712
Oh, no.
We're all going -- together.

20:27.780 --> 20:29.781
But first we need
some fresh wheels.

20:29.849 --> 20:31.249
Of course,
if boosting a car

20:31.317 --> 20:32.918
is gonna be a problem
for you two...

20:32.985 --> 20:34.319
Pbht!

20:34.387 --> 20:36.955
Grand theft auto is
my middle name, right, Robbie?

20:37.023 --> 20:39.124
For as long
as I've known her.

20:41.494 --> 20:42.827
<i>There's always a risk</i>

20:42.895 --> 20:45.330
<i>when using a stolen car</i>
<i>in an operation,</i>

20:45.398 --> 20:47.766
<i>but there are ways</i>
<i>to minimize that risk.</i>

20:47.833 --> 20:50.869
<i>Take it from an employee</i>
<i>parking lot during midday</i>

20:50.937 --> 20:53.205
<i>and chances are</i>
<i>it won't be missed for hours.</i>

20:53.272 --> 20:56.141
<i>You want an older model</i>
<i>to avoid anti-theft devices</i>

20:56.209 --> 20:59.044
<i>and a common, neutral color</i>
<i>that won't attract attention.</i>

20:59.111 --> 21:01.580
Bang a right up here.

21:01.647 --> 21:04.616
<i>Of course, it doesn't matter</i>
<i>how carefully you choose a car</i>

21:04.684 --> 21:07.319
<i>if you have to drive it</i>
<i>through a police checkpoint.</i>

21:07.386 --> 21:08.920
All right,
turn the car around.

21:08.988 --> 21:10.422
Turn it around now.

21:10.489 --> 21:13.458
Can't.
We're boxed in.

21:13.526 --> 21:15.527
Crap. The cops must have
blocked off the whole area.

21:15.595 --> 21:16.962
Nice. Your little plan
is about to get us pinched.

21:17.029 --> 21:17.796
Yeah, well,
it better not.

21:23.035 --> 21:25.303
Look, we'll run the roadblock.
What?

21:27.506 --> 21:29.174
We can pull into
that garage.

21:29.242 --> 21:31.943
Might be our best shot
at losing the cops.

21:35.114 --> 21:37.315
Especially if they have
a little fire to deal with.

21:46.192 --> 21:47.726
It's them!

21:53.866 --> 21:55.166
Get down!

22:06.012 --> 22:08.113
<i>A car on fire</i>
<i>makes a great diversion,</i>

22:08.180 --> 22:10.849
<i>but it takes a few minutes</i>
<i>to get it fully engulfed.</i>

22:10.916 --> 22:12.917
<i>If you don't have much time</i>
<i>to spare,</i>

22:12.985 --> 22:14.319
<i>find the closest</i>
<i>burning materials</i>

22:14.387 --> 22:16.254
<i>that will</i>
<i>create the most smoke --</i>

22:16.322 --> 22:20.525
<i>old newspapers and fast-food</i>
<i>bags doused in hand sanitizer.</i>

22:20.593 --> 22:22.594
<i>Stuff them in a rolled-up</i>
<i>rubber floor mat,</i>

22:22.662 --> 22:24.129
<i>and you've created a vent</i>

22:24.196 --> 22:26.364
<i>that will focus the flames</i>
<i>into one area.</i>

22:26.432 --> 22:27.799
What the hell
is she doing?

22:27.867 --> 22:29.367
Saving our asses <i>again.</i>

22:36.876 --> 22:39.110
<i>And the more focused</i>
<i>the flames,</i>

22:39.178 --> 22:40.812
<i>the faster everything burns.</i>

23:04.032 --> 23:06.655
This thing is getting
completely out of control, Sam

23:06.836 --> 23:09.304
I did not sign up
for a high-speed chase,

23:09.313 --> 23:12.265
setting cars on fire,
putting cops in danger!

23:12.347 --> 23:13.447
You got to
have a little faith

23:13.515 --> 23:15.283
that Mike
knows what he's doing.

23:15.350 --> 23:16.284
No.
No, I don't.

23:17.920 --> 23:19.420
I'm calling in
your buddy's position,

23:19.488 --> 23:21.222
and I'm having Jimmy
picked up right now.

23:21.290 --> 23:22.456
This is over.
Are you crazy?

23:22.524 --> 23:23.624
Mike is wearing a tracker.

23:23.692 --> 23:24.992
He's going to
meet Quinn,

23:25.060 --> 23:27.028
a guy that no one
could sniff out for years.

23:27.095 --> 23:28.462
Let's at least
get in the car

23:28.530 --> 23:29.764
and see
where this takes us.

23:29.831 --> 23:30.965
No.
You had your chance.

23:31.033 --> 23:33.968
You pull the plug,
your witness dies,

23:34.036 --> 23:35.202
and Quinn
goes free forever.

23:35.270 --> 23:36.270
Is that
what you really want?

23:41.577 --> 23:43.344
Better hope your guy
is as good as you think he is.

23:47.215 --> 23:48.416
Check this out.

23:48.483 --> 23:50.685
You guys have funny taste
in meeting places.

23:50.752 --> 23:52.954
We walked
all that way for this?

23:53.021 --> 23:55.389
I was hoping for some sand
between my toes.

23:55.457 --> 23:58.960
You'll have plenty of time
to catch some rays later.

23:59.027 --> 24:00.194
Where's Quinn?

24:00.262 --> 24:02.363
Quinn's not
coming to see you.

24:02.431 --> 24:04.332
You're going
to see him.

24:04.399 --> 24:07.101
But give me your clothes.
Throw these on.

24:07.169 --> 24:08.336
What?

24:08.403 --> 24:10.137
W-why my clothes?
Because Quinn got busted

24:10.205 --> 24:12.073
by a cop wearing a microphone
in his shoe once.

24:12.140 --> 24:12.974
That's why.

24:18.480 --> 24:20.514
I'm not handing over
my threads.

24:20.582 --> 24:22.083
They're mad expensive.

24:22.150 --> 24:24.085
Who says
you got a choice?

24:24.152 --> 24:25.286
What about my belt?

24:25.354 --> 24:26.954
It's my lucky belt.
Can I keep that?

24:27.022 --> 24:28.155
Hey, Robbie.

24:28.223 --> 24:30.591
Your luck's
gonna run out real fast

24:30.659 --> 24:32.927
if you don't start
listening to me!

24:34.229 --> 24:36.230
Fine.
What about her?

24:36.298 --> 24:39.533
Can she at least change
in some privacy?

24:39.601 --> 24:41.669
She keeps her clothes.

24:41.737 --> 24:44.305
Quinn says she ain't going.

24:44.373 --> 24:45.806
She stays
with Shane and Dylan.

24:45.874 --> 24:48.843
They'll take good care of her,
long as you play nice.

24:48.910 --> 24:50.077
That wasn't the deal.

24:50.145 --> 24:51.379
That's the deal now.

24:51.446 --> 24:52.713
Well, then,
the deal's off.

24:55.317 --> 24:58.653
Robbie, I'm fine.

25:01.256 --> 25:02.590
All right.

25:02.658 --> 25:05.459
I want to talk this over
with Dawn in someplace private.

25:05.527 --> 25:07.028
You talk
to her right here.

25:07.095 --> 25:09.163
No, I'm talking with her
in private

25:09.231 --> 25:10.765
or you're not getting
the information.

25:10.832 --> 25:13.534
Shoot me if you want.

25:13.602 --> 25:15.836
Maybe there's something in here

25:15.904 --> 25:17.071
we can use as a weapon.

25:17.139 --> 25:19.240
Michael, you need to go.

25:19.307 --> 25:20.741
I can't
leave you here, Fi.

25:20.809 --> 25:22.109
They're
taking the tracker.

25:22.177 --> 25:24.045
They're not gonna let us
walk out of here,

25:24.112 --> 25:25.379
and we can't
fight our way out, either.

25:25.447 --> 25:26.480
At least not yet.

25:26.548 --> 25:28.349
You need to
see this through.

25:28.417 --> 25:30.451
I think I can take the two guys
they're leaving me with.

25:30.519 --> 25:32.053
Try to find a way
to give me a signal

25:32.120 --> 25:34.689
when you're ready for me
to start the fun.

25:34.756 --> 25:36.390
So, you coming?

25:37.959 --> 25:41.595
Last chance.

25:43.665 --> 25:44.432
Hey, Robbie.

25:46.301 --> 25:48.335
Knock 'em dead.

25:48.403 --> 25:51.572
You know I will.

25:51.640 --> 25:55.042
Mike's got to be meeting with
Quinn just up the street here --

25:55.110 --> 25:57.344
maybe in one
of these warehouses.

25:57.412 --> 26:00.281
Looks like it's the next block
on the right.

26:00.348 --> 26:02.349
Sam, are you sure
this is the spot?

26:02.417 --> 26:04.051
I mean, it's a park,
and there's no one here.

26:04.119 --> 26:05.419
Signal's coming from
right over there

26:05.487 --> 26:07.388
where that garbage can is.

26:07.456 --> 26:09.724
Oh, crap!

26:18.633 --> 26:19.633
Damn it!

26:19.701 --> 26:21.736
Damn it.
We lost them.

26:29.344 --> 26:31.011
<i>A successful blackmail</i>

26:31.079 --> 26:33.447
<i>depends on the psychological</i>
<i>state of your target.</i>

26:33.515 --> 26:35.116
<i>Leading with your demand</i>

26:35.183 --> 26:37.952
<i>can risk putting him on the</i>
<i>defensive right from the start.</i>

26:38.019 --> 26:39.787
<i>But if you start by showing him</i>

26:39.855 --> 26:42.156
<i>how his world's</i>
<i>about to crash down first,</i>

26:42.224 --> 26:44.725
<i>he'll be looking for the key</i>
<i>to his salvation</i>

26:44.793 --> 26:47.528
<i>and be more likely to take it</i>
<i>when you offer it to him.</i>

26:47.596 --> 26:50.865
Wake up, sleepyhead.

26:50.932 --> 26:52.233
Mark?

26:52.300 --> 26:55.069
Ugh. What time is it?

26:55.137 --> 26:56.704
It's 2:00 a.m.

26:56.772 --> 26:59.440
Oh, God!
I got to call my wife.

26:59.508 --> 27:00.441
No, no.
It's okay.

27:00.509 --> 27:01.909
I texted her
from your phone,

27:01.977 --> 27:03.611
told her that you
had some bad Sushi

27:03.678 --> 27:05.246
and you'll call her
in the morning.

27:05.313 --> 27:06.747
You're good.
Oh, God. Thank you.

27:06.815 --> 27:13.220
However, you might not be --
oh! -- When she sees these.

27:13.288 --> 27:16.357
Man, that Trixie
was a fun gal, wasn't she?

27:16.424 --> 27:17.725
Or is that Cinnamon?
Oh, my God.

27:17.793 --> 27:19.193
I can't remember.
It doesn't matter.

27:19.261 --> 27:20.561
There was a bunch
of them up here.

27:20.629 --> 27:22.496
Oh, my God!
I know, right?

27:22.564 --> 27:25.166
Why did you take these?
What is this?

27:25.233 --> 27:28.169
This is bad,
is what this is.

27:28.236 --> 27:30.905
But it doesn't
have to be.

27:30.972 --> 27:33.741
No one needs to see these,
including your wife.

27:33.809 --> 27:37.077
I can help you with that
if you help me with what I need.

27:37.145 --> 27:39.079
<i>Wait.</i>
<i>Are you blackmailing me?</i>

27:39.147 --> 27:41.282
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>But let's not call it that.</i>

27:41.349 --> 27:43.350
<i>Let's call it</i>
<i>a potential win-win.</i>

27:43.418 --> 27:44.985
So what do you want?

27:45.053 --> 27:48.389
I want the records
of every sniper rifle you sold

27:48.456 --> 27:50.157
in the last 12 months.

27:50.225 --> 27:52.760
<i>Of course, no blackmail attempt</i>
<i>can succeed</i>

27:52.828 --> 27:54.795
<i>if your target has no fear</i>
<i>of being extorted.</i>

28:00.569 --> 28:02.369
<i>You think</i>
<i>you're the first person</i>

28:02.437 --> 28:04.104
<i>who's ever tried</i>
<i>to blackmail me?</i>

28:04.172 --> 28:06.540
<i>There was a girl once</i>
<i>who wanted money from me.</i>

28:06.608 --> 28:10.110
I told her
to go to hell.

28:10.178 --> 28:11.278
You know why?

28:11.346 --> 28:12.413
Why's that?

28:12.480 --> 28:14.215
Because my father
has friends

28:14.282 --> 28:16.617
in every police department
in the country,

28:16.685 --> 28:19.854
not to mention every politician
he's personally bankrolled.

28:19.921 --> 28:21.021
One call from him,

28:21.089 --> 28:23.357
and you're in a whole world
of hurt.

28:23.425 --> 28:25.259
<i>You need to hear me out</i>
<i>on this, man.</i>

28:25.327 --> 28:26.560
<i>I think</i>
<i>I've heard enough.</i>

28:26.628 --> 28:27.962
<i>Listen.</i>

28:28.029 --> 28:29.330
<i>You walk out that door,</i>
<i>you're gonna regret it.</i>

28:29.397 --> 28:31.899
I don't think so.

28:35.670 --> 28:36.704
No, no.
He's right.

28:36.771 --> 28:38.105
You are definitely
gonna regret it,

28:38.173 --> 28:39.607
and so will your father,

28:39.674 --> 28:41.075
because if you don't
play ball with us,

28:41.142 --> 28:42.376
we won't just ruin you,
we'll ruin him.

28:42.444 --> 28:44.245
Who are you?

28:44.312 --> 28:46.680
Someone who knows about
your father's bank accounts,

28:46.748 --> 28:49.483
and I don't mean just the ones
he jots down on his tax returns.

28:49.551 --> 28:51.085
I'm talking about the ones

28:51.152 --> 28:53.420
he uses to grease
those friends of his.

28:53.488 --> 28:55.155
All it takes is
an anonymous call

28:55.223 --> 28:58.058
to the U.S. attorney's office,
and they'll be filing charges --

28:58.126 --> 28:59.026
Okay. Okay.

28:59.094 --> 29:00.427
I'll get the records.

29:00.495 --> 29:01.629
Good boy.

29:01.696 --> 29:03.564
Now go
clean yourself up.

29:09.838 --> 29:10.938
What the hell
are you doing?

29:11.006 --> 29:12.239
You shouldn't have
shown your face.

29:12.307 --> 29:13.641
I did
what I had to do.

29:13.708 --> 29:16.810
How'd you know about
those bank accounts, anyway?

29:16.878 --> 29:18.512
I didn't.

29:27.088 --> 29:28.756
<i>The passage of time</i>

29:28.823 --> 29:32.226
<i>is one of the most often-used</i>
<i>tools in counterintelligence.</i>

29:32.294 --> 29:35.329
<i>It allows an adversary</i>
<i>to observe you</i>

29:35.397 --> 29:37.631
<i>and determine</i>
<i>whether you've been followed,</i>

29:37.699 --> 29:40.501
<i>then it's just a matter</i>
<i>of whether they've seen enough</i>

29:40.568 --> 29:43.537
<i>to make a new acquaintance</i>
<i>or a corpse.</i>

29:43.605 --> 29:47.608
Sorry for the less-than-stellar
accommodations, Robbie.

29:47.676 --> 29:51.612
I don't get a lot of people
just dropping by these days.

29:54.249 --> 29:56.850
It's good to
meet you, Quinn. Yeah.

29:56.918 --> 29:59.453
I'd shake your hand,
but, you know.

30:00.689 --> 30:02.957
I hear you have
some information

30:03.024 --> 30:06.527
on where Kelly Duke might be
spending his days lately.

30:08.530 --> 30:10.497
Before we get started,

30:10.565 --> 30:13.300
I feel it's only fair
to warn you...

30:13.368 --> 30:16.170
You lie to me,
my guys put a bullet

30:16.237 --> 30:17.338
through each of
your girlfriend's eyes.

30:19.641 --> 30:20.741
Got that?

30:23.278 --> 30:24.311
Good.

30:24.379 --> 30:26.580
Get her
on the phone, Jimmy.

30:31.419 --> 30:33.053
You there, darling?

30:33.121 --> 30:34.521
Is Robbie okay?

30:34.589 --> 30:36.590
He's fine,
and you will be, too --

30:36.658 --> 30:38.993
so long as Robbie here
is straight with us.

30:39.060 --> 30:39.893
Go ahead, Shane.

30:45.066 --> 30:47.601
That's just a taste.
Keep you honest.

30:50.705 --> 30:54.742
Now tell me where that
son-of-a-bitch witness is.

30:54.809 --> 30:58.012
<i>Spies feed enemies</i>
<i>false information all the time.</i>

30:58.079 --> 31:01.548
<i>Sometimes, though, you have to</i>
<i>give up the real thing --</i>

31:01.616 --> 31:05.119
<i>actual intelligence that puts</i>
<i>innocent people in danger.</i>

31:05.186 --> 31:08.555
<i>It's rough, rolling the dice</i>
<i>with someone else's life.</i>

31:08.623 --> 31:11.692
<i>But sometimes</i>
<i>it's the only play.</i>

31:11.760 --> 31:15.262
Duke is at
North Miami General Hospital.

31:15.330 --> 31:18.399
He's under
24-hour police protection.

31:21.469 --> 31:23.670
Jimmy.

31:23.738 --> 31:24.972
Send one of your guys

31:25.040 --> 31:27.541
to make sure our friend's
information checks out.

31:31.012 --> 31:34.481
Looks like someone's
getting put down today.

31:34.549 --> 31:38.085
The question is
whether it's Duke or your girl.

31:44.569 --> 31:45.803
- So?
- We got Duke.

31:45.870 --> 31:48.172
He's at North Miami General,
just like Robbie said.

31:48.239 --> 31:49.506
I told you the truth.

31:49.574 --> 31:51.542
Now can we get rid
of these here?

31:51.609 --> 31:54.411
Jimmy, are you sure Robbie here
ain't playing us?

31:54.479 --> 31:56.280
Quinn,
don't be crazy.

31:56.348 --> 31:58.649
Why would he come in here
telling us all about Duke

31:58.717 --> 31:59.550
if he wasn't legit?

32:04.789 --> 32:05.990
You're right.

32:06.057 --> 32:09.293
Sorry, Robbie.

32:09.361 --> 32:11.362
When you been running
as long as I have,

32:11.429 --> 32:12.963
it does something
to your head.

32:13.031 --> 32:13.864
Cut him loose.

32:16.668 --> 32:18.836
Gather your guys
and get over to the hospital.

32:18.903 --> 32:20.938
Take care of this son of a bitch
Duke once and for all.

32:21.006 --> 32:21.972
All right.

32:22.040 --> 32:23.774
Hey,
what about the cops?

32:23.842 --> 32:26.510
There's two of them
sitting outside his room.

32:26.578 --> 32:27.611
What do you think?

32:34.386 --> 32:36.954
Guess I owe you some money,
don't I?

32:37.022 --> 32:40.557
Jimmy said something
about you expecting a reward

32:40.625 --> 32:42.326
for your information.

32:42.394 --> 32:44.028
I'd appreciate
a one-time payment,

32:44.095 --> 32:46.530
but I'm more interested
in a more permanent position

32:46.598 --> 32:48.065
with your group.

32:48.133 --> 32:50.067
Seeing how you're gonna be
back into the swing of things

32:50.135 --> 32:51.135
and all.

32:51.202 --> 32:54.104
What'd you
have in mind?

32:54.172 --> 32:55.272
Maybe we could discuss this

32:55.340 --> 32:56.707
somewhere a little more
civilized?

32:56.775 --> 32:59.243
I mean, I appreciate the cot
and all, but, uh,

32:59.310 --> 33:02.112
I like to talk to business
over a nice bottle of scotch.

33:02.180 --> 33:03.981
All right.

33:04.049 --> 33:06.950
Single malt it is.

33:07.018 --> 33:11.321
<i>When you've been driven</i>
<i>to a meeting in a head bag,</i>

33:11.389 --> 33:13.924
<i>figuring out your location</i>
<i>can be a challenge.</i>

33:13.992 --> 33:16.360
<i>If you know how long</i>
<i>you were on the road,</i>

33:16.428 --> 33:18.395
<i>you can use</i>
<i>the local speed limits</i>

33:18.463 --> 33:21.498
<i>to calculate a general area,</i>
<i>and if you can get to a window,</i>

33:21.566 --> 33:24.201
<i>local landmarks can</i>
<i>narrow it down even further.</i>

33:24.269 --> 33:26.470
Oh, is that downtown
across the water?

33:26.538 --> 33:29.173
No.
Miami Beach.

33:29.240 --> 33:32.576
<i>It's the sort of thing</i>
<i>you learn in the boy scouts,</i>

33:32.644 --> 33:34.845
<i>except boy scouts rarely do it</i>
<i>with a gun to their back.</i>

33:37.749 --> 33:38.949
Nice neighborhood.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.751
I don't get out much.

33:40.819 --> 33:41.852
Aw, that's a shame.

33:41.920 --> 33:43.687
You got a wicked amazing
view here.

33:43.755 --> 33:45.089
You even got a view
of that bridge.

33:45.156 --> 33:47.057
Bet it looks nice
lit up at night.

33:47.125 --> 33:48.525
What is that?

33:48.593 --> 33:50.461
MacArthur Causeway.

33:50.528 --> 33:54.098
Now, are you here to admire
the view or discuss terms?

33:54.165 --> 33:55.299
Definitely discuss terms.

33:55.366 --> 33:56.700
I just need to
talk to my girl first.

33:56.768 --> 33:58.102
Don't worry about her.
She's fine.

33:58.169 --> 33:59.403
She didn't sound too fine

33:59.471 --> 34:01.171
when one of your boys
was smacking her around.

34:01.239 --> 34:02.272
Now, I get it.

34:02.340 --> 34:03.373
You got to do
what you got to do,

34:03.441 --> 34:04.641
but where we come from,

34:04.709 --> 34:06.276
a man takes care
of his woman first.

34:09.280 --> 34:13.250
Get me Dylan and Shane
on the phone.

34:16.955 --> 34:19.123
Dylan.
Put the girl on.

34:20.692 --> 34:22.659
Hi, hon.
You all right?

34:22.726 --> 34:24.761
I'm fine, Robbie.

34:24.829 --> 34:26.463
Just a little bruise
is all.

34:26.531 --> 34:28.732
There ain't nothing here
I can't handle.

34:28.800 --> 34:29.833
Nothing.

34:29.900 --> 34:30.934
How's everything
with you?

34:31.002 --> 34:32.902
Oh, I couldn't be
better, hon.

34:32.971 --> 34:34.438
I'm here
at Quinn's place.

34:34.505 --> 34:35.739
You should see it.

34:35.806 --> 34:37.741
Maybe you and I can get
a place like this one day.

34:37.809 --> 34:39.510
It's got view
of Miami Beach.

34:39.577 --> 34:41.812
We're right next to
the MacArthur Causeway.

34:41.880 --> 34:43.947
It lights up at night.

34:44.014 --> 34:45.916
Oh.
It is on fire.

34:45.984 --> 34:48.585
Oh, I can totally
see it, baby.

34:48.652 --> 34:49.719
Yeah,
it's beautiful.

34:49.786 --> 34:51.188
Just me, Quinn,
a couple of his boys

34:51.255 --> 34:55.058
drinking the finest scotch
I ever had, and, uh --

34:55.126 --> 34:58.495
so, listen, I got to go here
and you got to go there, so...

34:58.563 --> 34:59.763
You just tell me when.

34:59.831 --> 35:01.298
I'm ready, sweetheart.

35:01.366 --> 35:03.667
All right.
We'll hang up together.

35:03.735 --> 35:05.369
On three.

35:05.436 --> 35:06.637
One...

35:09.440 --> 35:12.142
...two...

35:12.210 --> 35:14.878
...three.

35:40.471 --> 35:42.439
What the hell?

35:42.507 --> 35:43.640
Come on!

36:06.231 --> 36:08.232
Who the hell are you?

36:08.299 --> 36:10.200
I am just a guy

36:10.268 --> 36:12.202
who enjoys a nice bottle
of scotch.

36:27.085 --> 36:29.253
It's Fi.

36:29.320 --> 36:30.554
Fi, thank God.

36:30.622 --> 36:32.089
We were starting to think
you guys were dead.

36:32.156 --> 36:33.523
Yeah, well,
don't celebrate yet.

36:33.591 --> 36:34.925
Michael's by himself
at Quinn's house.

36:34.993 --> 36:36.426
It's a big place
with a view of Miami Beach,

36:36.494 --> 36:38.028
close to the MacArthur Causeway.

36:38.096 --> 36:40.163
You need to get there
as fast as you can.

36:40.231 --> 36:42.766
House with a view of Miami Beach
near MacArthur Causeway.

36:42.834 --> 36:44.201
He wasn't more specific?

36:44.269 --> 36:46.570
Well, I'm pretty sure he said
it was gonna be on fire.

36:46.638 --> 36:47.904
House on fire.
Okay.

36:47.972 --> 36:49.573
That sounds like Mike.
We're on our way.

36:49.641 --> 36:51.375
Place is off MacArthur.

36:51.442 --> 36:52.676
We can be there
in 10 minutes.

36:52.744 --> 36:54.011
Let's make it five.
We'll take my car.

37:05.323 --> 37:08.792
<i>A good defensive position</i>
<i>is known as a force multiply.</i>

37:08.860 --> 37:10.127
Come on.
Bust that lock.

37:10.194 --> 37:12.162
<i>One man</i>
<i>can hold off three others</i>

37:12.230 --> 37:14.498
<i>as long as he can remain</i>
<i>well-protected</i>

37:14.565 --> 37:17.567
<i>while keeping up a steady</i>
<i>stream of suppressant fire.</i>

37:17.635 --> 37:20.404
<i>Only problem is doing that</i>
<i>requires a lot of ammunition.</i>

37:20.471 --> 37:22.139
<i>And when it's all gone,</i>

37:22.206 --> 37:24.841
<i>your defensive position very</i>
<i>quickly becomes a death trap.</i>

37:26.678 --> 37:27.911
Hey, hold on a sec.

37:27.979 --> 37:30.480
I want to talk to
this son of a bitch.

37:30.548 --> 37:33.684
You've wasted a lot of bullets
shooting at that door.

37:33.751 --> 37:35.152
Can't last forever.

37:35.219 --> 37:38.755
By my count, you got one more
shot left in that clip.

37:38.823 --> 37:40.957
Do yourself a favor --
give up.

37:41.025 --> 37:42.392
I may trade you
back to the cops.

37:42.460 --> 37:43.894
I'm sure they'd want
their snitch back.

37:48.499 --> 37:51.768
You're awfully interested
in that fire.

37:51.836 --> 37:54.871
Let me guess --
some kind of signal.

37:54.939 --> 37:56.440
Quinn, we're running out
of time.

37:56.507 --> 37:57.341
We're coming in.

38:00.778 --> 38:04.247
Tell your boys to back off,
or this will get ugly.

38:04.315 --> 38:06.717
All right.

38:06.784 --> 38:09.019
<i>Taking a hostage</i>
<i>is only as effective</i>

38:09.087 --> 38:11.355
<i>as his relationship</i>
<i>with his rescuers.</i>

38:11.422 --> 38:14.358
<i>The more they value his life,</i>
<i>the more leverage you have.</i>

38:14.425 --> 38:16.326
Listen up, boys.

38:16.394 --> 38:17.661
Hey, shut up,
shut up, shut up.

38:17.729 --> 38:19.096
He's talking.
He's talking.

38:19.163 --> 38:20.597
This bastard's
already got the cops coming.

38:20.665 --> 38:22.265
It's over.

38:22.333 --> 38:24.634
<i>Of course, if your hostage</i>
<i>doesn't value his own life,</i>

38:24.702 --> 38:25.969
<i>all bets are off.</i>

38:26.037 --> 38:28.605
But I'd rather die
than go back to the joint,

38:28.673 --> 38:29.539
so kill this son of --

38:31.709 --> 38:32.909
If you shoot
in there --

38:32.977 --> 38:34.778
you heard him.
It's what he wants.

38:34.846 --> 38:36.646
Finish this!

38:37.548 --> 38:38.949
Go, go, go!

38:45.690 --> 38:46.990
Okay! Stop! Stop!

38:49.394 --> 38:52.362
You don't even have
the guts to kill me yourself.

38:52.430 --> 38:54.231
You should have
taken my deal, boy.

39:05.176 --> 39:07.544
Lock and load, fellas!
It's time to go in!

39:09.547 --> 39:11.081
Anybody else want some?

39:11.149 --> 39:12.616
Lose the weapons!

39:12.683 --> 39:14.317
You won't be taking
any witnesses out today.

39:14.385 --> 39:16.086
Why don't you fellas
slide those guns over here

39:16.154 --> 39:17.854
and take a knee?

39:17.922 --> 39:19.623
Mike!

39:19.690 --> 39:21.358
You all right in there?

39:21.426 --> 39:22.559
Mike!

39:27.832 --> 39:29.833
What took you
so long?

39:29.901 --> 39:32.002
Told you
we'd get him.

39:32.069 --> 39:34.037
Easy peasy.

39:36.851 --> 39:38.136
Well, we don't have the shooter

39:38.137 --> 39:39.270
but we do have the sniper rifle --

39:39.338 --> 39:41.139
the sale order shows
where the gun was made,

39:41.206 --> 39:42.373
when it was shipped,

39:42.441 --> 39:43.975
and then it landed
at the Pryon Group.

39:44.043 --> 39:45.743
That's a private security firm
upstate.

39:45.811 --> 39:48.880
And whoever took that gun
used it to shoot Nate.

39:48.947 --> 39:50.782
Yeah.

39:50.849 --> 39:52.116
Thanks, Jesse.

39:52.184 --> 39:53.718
I'm sorry I couldn't be
more help with this.

39:53.786 --> 39:54.952
Please.

39:55.020 --> 39:56.621
I went to a strip club,
snapped a few photos.

39:56.688 --> 39:57.855
From what I hear,

39:57.923 --> 40:00.091
you guys went through hell
to make this happen.

40:00.159 --> 40:02.160
Look,
I got to get going,

40:02.227 --> 40:03.861
but, um, just call me
if you need anything, okay?

40:10.335 --> 40:14.172
He's right.
The job was hell.

40:14.239 --> 40:16.874
But you probably could have
managed it without me.

40:16.942 --> 40:18.142
Fi.

40:18.210 --> 40:19.477
No.

40:19.545 --> 40:21.646
You really didn't
need my help.

40:21.713 --> 40:22.947
You can stop now.

40:23.015 --> 40:27.318
I should have
just stayed home.

40:27.386 --> 40:30.721
I'm glad
that you came.

40:30.789 --> 40:35.626
You know...
I would like to show you

40:35.694 --> 40:37.995
something else
that you can't do without me.

40:53.245 --> 40:55.012
If you're thinking
of shooting through the door,

40:55.080 --> 40:56.013
please don't.

40:56.081 --> 40:59.117
It's me -- Pearce.

41:08.093 --> 41:09.927
Pearce, I was gonna
call and thank --

41:09.995 --> 41:11.629
Michael,
I can't talk long.

41:11.697 --> 41:13.598
Is everything okay?

41:13.665 --> 41:15.433
No.
Most definitely not.

41:15.501 --> 41:18.603
The C.I.A. found out
about my approach to Meyerson.

41:18.670 --> 41:19.837
How?

41:19.905 --> 41:22.039
Meyerson was
acting suspicious at home,

41:22.107 --> 41:25.176
his wife noticed,
and he came clean to her.

41:25.244 --> 41:26.944
Guess she was upset
and blew the whistle,

41:27.012 --> 41:28.412
because eventually it got
to the Agency.

41:28.480 --> 41:29.881
They traced it back to me.

41:29.948 --> 41:32.116
The C.I.A. did send me
to that conference, after all.

41:32.184 --> 41:33.484
I'll call the Agency.

41:33.552 --> 41:35.353
I'll take
full responsibility.

41:35.420 --> 41:36.587
No, you won't.

41:36.655 --> 41:37.655
I already told them
I was moonlighting

41:37.723 --> 41:38.823
on some
corporate-espionage work

41:38.891 --> 41:40.525
for one
of Meyerson's competitors.

41:40.592 --> 41:42.760
Needless to say,
Langley wasn't too happy,

41:42.828 --> 41:44.662
but no one
knows you're connected.

41:44.730 --> 41:45.763
I can't
let you do this.

41:45.831 --> 41:47.865
Michael,
you can and you will.

41:47.933 --> 41:51.135
Consider this my last order
as your senior officer.

41:53.372 --> 41:55.873
What are you talking about,
your last orders?

41:55.941 --> 41:58.176
I've been reassigned
to Mumbai,

41:58.243 --> 42:02.046
part of an anti-counterfeiting
task force.

42:02.114 --> 42:05.316
I leave the country
in a few hours.

42:05.384 --> 42:07.385
Pearce, you're gonna be stuck
in some room

42:07.452 --> 42:09.053
examining fake
prescription labels

42:09.121 --> 42:10.421
for the rest
of your career.

42:10.489 --> 42:12.657
Could have been worse.

42:12.724 --> 42:18.029
They were looking to fill the
ice-station post in Reykjavik.

42:18.096 --> 42:19.363
I have to go.

42:25.204 --> 42:28.372
Just promise me this won't be
for nothing, Michael.

42:30.008 --> 42:32.610
I promise.
