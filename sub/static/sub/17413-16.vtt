WEBVTT

00:06.803 --> 00:08.173
So, you know, prom's coming up.

00:08.175 --> 00:11.910
And I think me and you have
something really special.

00:13.914 --> 00:17.182
And I'd really be honored if
you'd be my date to the prom.

00:17.184 --> 00:19.918
Oh, Austin.

00:19.920 --> 00:22.654
Are you kidding me?

00:22.656 --> 00:24.957
That's how you're going
to ask Piper to the prom?

00:24.959 --> 00:26.792
Bor-ing.

00:26.794 --> 00:28.327
What was wrong with that?

00:28.329 --> 00:30.295
It's all about the big ask.

00:30.297 --> 00:32.331
You have to ask her
in a memorable way.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.466
Something big.
Something romantic.

00:34.468 --> 00:35.845
Yeah, like when Jace asked me.

00:35.876 --> 00:38.771
We were videochatting while he
was jumping out of an airplane,

00:38.773 --> 00:42.608
and he wouldn't open his
parachute until I said yes.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.676
See? Romantic.

00:44.678 --> 00:48.347
I've always dreamt about how I
was going to be asked to prom.

00:48.349 --> 00:51.417
Flowers, violin music,

00:51.419 --> 00:55.454
my date on a white horse dressed
as a knight in shining armor.

00:55.456 --> 00:57.256
Bor-ing.

00:57.258 --> 01:01.026
I can't believe Gavin
hasn't asked you yet.

01:01.028 --> 01:02.861
You know, prom's only a
couple of weeks away.

01:02.863 --> 01:06.799
He will. I'm sure he's just trying to
figure out something extra special.

01:06.801 --> 01:08.901
Austin! Where's the egg?

01:08.903 --> 01:10.602
Relax. It's right here.

01:10.604 --> 01:12.004
Ah!

01:15.241 --> 01:17.709
No, way! A Zalien egg?!

01:17.711 --> 01:19.845
Yep. I'm about to ask
Carrie to go to prom.

01:19.847 --> 01:23.982
On our first date, we
saw Tears of the dead."

01:25.251 --> 01:27.316
I'm going to recreate the
final scene where the

01:27.347 --> 01:29.254
baby Zalien king pops
his head out of an egg.

01:29.256 --> 01:32.257
But instead of eating
Carrie's delicious brain,

01:32.259 --> 01:34.860
I'm going to ask her
to be my date to prom.

01:36.297 --> 01:37.658
Here comes Carrie.
Get in the egg.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.367
Has anyone seen my dezzie?

01:42.369 --> 01:43.936
Carrie!

01:43.938 --> 01:47.039
Karate chop!

01:47.041 --> 01:49.475
Carrie! That's Dez.

01:51.411 --> 01:54.646
"Tears of dead." First date.

01:54.648 --> 01:56.715
Prom. Go with?

01:56.717 --> 01:58.517
I'd love to go to prom with you.

01:58.519 --> 02:00.986
Yay!

02:58.077 --> 03:00.546
Hey, Ally. Did...

03:00.548 --> 03:02.848
no, Gavin didn't ask
me to prom yet.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.616
You don't know I was
going to ask you that.

03:04.618 --> 03:06.118
Then what were you
going to ask me?

03:06.120 --> 03:09.855
Gavin prom thing.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.690
So, Austin, did you ask...

03:11.692 --> 03:12.925
no, I didn't ask Piper yet.

03:12.927 --> 03:14.660
But I came up with a
great way to do it.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.061
I'm not telling anyone
'cause I don't want

03:16.063 --> 03:17.663
her to find out... Dez.

03:17.665 --> 03:19.798
I can keep a secret.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.467
I never told anybody you sleep
with a lavender eye pillow.

03:23.937 --> 03:25.604
You just told Ally.

03:25.606 --> 03:28.507
Relax, it's not like I told her
about your ladybug night light.

03:31.911 --> 03:33.845
Guess who doesn't
have a date to prom.

03:33.847 --> 03:34.913
- Oh, no.
- What happened?

03:34.915 --> 03:36.014
Did you and Jace break up?

03:36.016 --> 03:38.116
No, but his leg broke up.

03:38.118 --> 03:41.153
He was trying to do a skateboard
trick while riding a motorcycle.

03:41.155 --> 03:42.854
- Awesome.
- Cool.

03:42.856 --> 03:44.890
Now he can't go to prom with me.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.959
- Horrible.
- That's terrible.

03:48.094 --> 03:51.797
Looks like you and Ally are going to be
the only two people not going to prom.

03:51.799 --> 03:53.632
Oh, I'm going. Just
not with Jace.

03:53.634 --> 03:55.834
So then Ally's the
only one not going?

03:57.403 --> 04:01.974
They're having a couples' dance
contest, and the winners get $1,000.

04:01.976 --> 04:05.010
Once I find a date who can
dance, that's going to be me.

04:05.012 --> 04:07.412
Oh ho ho, I don't think so.

04:07.414 --> 04:09.414
Me and Carrie are going to win.

04:09.416 --> 04:11.950
Wait... Austin, are you entering
the prom dance competition?

04:11.952 --> 04:14.019
No. It wouldn't be fair.

04:14.021 --> 04:16.088
Cool. Oh ho ho ho ho!

04:16.089 --> 04:17.623
I don't think so.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.558
Me and Carrie are going to win.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.860
We've been working on
some pretty flashy moves.

04:23.563 --> 04:25.130
What.

04:26.499 --> 04:28.734
I can't lose.

04:28.736 --> 04:31.837
I want to use the prize money to fly
to Albuquerque and surprise Jace.

04:31.839 --> 04:35.607
That's sweet, but won't he be upset
you're going to prom with somebody else?

04:35.609 --> 04:37.209
Yep, very upset.

04:37.211 --> 04:39.211
That's why I'm telling
him I'm going alone.

04:39.213 --> 04:40.846
He'll never find out.

04:40.848 --> 04:43.815
As long as nobody says
anything stupid... Dez.

04:43.817 --> 04:46.218
I can keep a secret.

04:46.220 --> 04:50.622
I never told Ally that you threw away
the hat she gave you for your birthday.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.825
You just told her.

04:53.827 --> 04:56.595
You said a seagull swooped
down and took that hat.

04:56.597 --> 04:59.464
Well, I couldn't say
a bear took it.

04:59.466 --> 05:02.567
'Cause that's what I said about the
purse you gave me for Christmas.

05:09.776 --> 05:11.043
Are you going to eat that?

05:11.045 --> 05:15.480
You mean this sandwich that I'm
literally putting in my mouth?

05:15.482 --> 05:17.249
Yes.

05:17.251 --> 05:19.484
Oh, 'cause there's a bug on it.

05:23.656 --> 05:25.857
Ally, Ally! Gavin's
heading this way.

05:25.859 --> 05:28.160
He's all dressed up and
he's carrying flowers.

05:28.162 --> 05:30.729
This is it. He's finally
asking you to prom.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.632
Just act natural.

05:35.568 --> 05:37.969
Or whatever that is.

05:37.971 --> 05:39.905
I'm going to film this.

05:39.907 --> 05:41.673
You'll want to remember
this moment forever.

05:43.910 --> 05:45.077
Ally.

05:45.079 --> 05:46.912
Oh, hi, Gavin.

05:46.914 --> 05:49.014
I have something very
important to ask you.

05:49.016 --> 05:52.217
Whatever could it be?

05:52.219 --> 05:54.252
I'm singing to a sick
fan at the hospital,

05:54.254 --> 05:56.621
and I was wondering if these
are good flowers to bring.

05:58.791 --> 06:02.627
Oh. That's your
important question?

06:02.629 --> 06:05.130
Oh. Yeah, sure.

06:05.132 --> 06:06.998
Those flowers...

06:07.000 --> 06:09.735
That you know are my favorite...

06:09.737 --> 06:11.737
Should do.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.538
I knew you'd have the answer.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.107
You're the best.

06:15.109 --> 06:17.809
Hey, we need to plan a
big night out soon.

06:22.882 --> 06:24.916
I'll email this video to you.

06:26.252 --> 06:29.621
I can't believe Gavin.

06:29.623 --> 06:30.822
I know.

06:30.824 --> 06:33.592
Singing to a sick fan
is so thoughtful.

06:33.594 --> 06:36.061
That's not what she meant.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.663
I don't think he's ever
going to ask me to prom.

06:38.665 --> 06:40.165
I know how you feel, Ally.

06:40.167 --> 06:42.033
Austin still hasn't
asked me yet.

07:19.005 --> 07:20.005
So what do you say?

07:21.742 --> 07:23.208
Yes.

07:26.312 --> 07:28.647
I'll email you a
copy of this video.

07:35.154 --> 07:37.222
We're going to have
so much fun at prom.

07:37.224 --> 07:38.890
I know.

07:38.892 --> 07:40.926
It's going to be the most
romantic night ever.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.129
Oh!

07:46.133 --> 07:47.732
Bad news, babe.

07:47.734 --> 07:49.067
I know we both really
had our hearts set

07:49.069 --> 07:51.703
on riding into prom on
top of a giant elephant,

07:51.705 --> 07:54.306
but my cousin won't let us
borrow his giant elephant.

07:54.308 --> 07:55.740
Oh!

07:55.742 --> 07:58.310
Hey, the important thing is
that we're going to prom...

07:58.312 --> 08:02.380
which will obviously be the most
romantic, magical night of our lives.

08:05.685 --> 08:08.086
Guess who got a date for prom.

08:08.088 --> 08:09.688
Seriously?

08:10.857 --> 08:12.691
Who's the lucky guy?

08:12.693 --> 08:15.160
- You'll never guess.
- Not so fast, Trish.

08:20.967 --> 08:22.834
I want to tell them
the good news.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.670
Trish and I are going
to prom together.

08:25.672 --> 08:26.972
- What?
- Really?

08:26.974 --> 08:28.073
Chuck?

08:28.075 --> 08:30.775
And she asked me.

08:30.777 --> 08:32.177
- What?
- Really?

08:32.179 --> 08:32.751
Chuck?

08:32.783 --> 08:35.046
He was the best dancer
who didn't have a date.

08:35.048 --> 08:38.049
I thought you were
dating sun hee.

08:38.051 --> 08:41.219
Yeah, remember the girl you broke
up with my sister to go out with?

08:41.221 --> 08:42.854
Oh, I remember.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.289
Sorry about that, red.

08:44.291 --> 08:47.092
There's only so much
Chuck to go around.

08:47.094 --> 08:50.762
Chuck and Sun Hee have one of those
on again, off again relationships.

08:50.764 --> 08:52.731
Right now, we're off again.

08:52.733 --> 08:57.068
And lucky for trishy-poo, I turned
down five other prom dates.

08:58.805 --> 09:01.940
Five other girls asked
that guy to prom?

09:01.942 --> 09:04.109
He's a ladies' man.

09:04.111 --> 09:06.978
We're going to win that
dance contest, red.

09:06.980 --> 09:10.148
You're wrong, Chuck. 'Cause Carrie and I
are going to win that dance competition.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.117
Oh, ho ho, no, you're not.

09:12.119 --> 09:16.087
My dance moves are so fly... okay,
I don't have time for this.

09:16.089 --> 09:19.090
You need to save your energy for
dance practice tonight, Chuck.

09:19.092 --> 09:20.325
Yeah.

09:20.327 --> 09:22.994
Keep pretending this
is all about dancing.

09:22.996 --> 09:25.030
I think we all know
the real reason

09:25.032 --> 09:27.032
you asked me to prom
is 'cause you like me.

09:38.177 --> 09:40.779
It's just about dancing.

09:45.384 --> 09:47.185
You ready to order?

09:47.187 --> 09:50.355
I think I'm going to start
with some prom-egranate juice.

09:50.357 --> 09:53.124
You mean pomegranate juice?

09:53.126 --> 09:54.359
What did I say?

09:54.361 --> 09:56.094
Prom-egranate?

09:56.096 --> 09:58.263
That's weird.

09:58.265 --> 10:01.199
It's pom. Not prom.

10:01.201 --> 10:02.834
Are you going to be
doing this all night?

10:02.836 --> 10:04.135
Sorry.

10:04.137 --> 10:10.041
It's just that my prom's only a week
away, and everybody else has a date.

10:10.043 --> 10:11.242
About that.

10:11.244 --> 10:13.144
See, prom is on the same night

10:13.146 --> 10:16.314
as this other awesome event that I
really wanted to take you to...

10:16.316 --> 10:18.149
the pig mud run.

10:19.885 --> 10:22.187
Wow.

10:22.189 --> 10:24.923
That does sound awesome.

10:24.925 --> 10:27.359
What's a pig mud run?

10:27.361 --> 10:31.196
It's a race in my hometown where you
carry a pig through a muddy field

10:31.198 --> 10:32.430
while people throw
tomatoes at you.

10:32.432 --> 10:35.433
And I thought prom was romantic.

10:35.435 --> 10:37.135
So what do you say?

10:37.137 --> 10:38.370
Come with me.

10:38.372 --> 10:42.040
You'll get to see my
ranch, and meet my family.

10:42.042 --> 10:45.210
And have tomatoes thrown at you
while you carry a muddy pig.

10:45.212 --> 10:51.916
As great as all that sounds, I
really want to go to my prom.

10:51.918 --> 10:53.413
Well, maybe this will
change your mind.

10:53.437 --> 10:57.055
When you cross the finish line and
hose down, you get to eat your pig.

10:58.991 --> 11:00.225
Yeah.

11:00.227 --> 11:02.193
That didn't change my mind.

11:08.300 --> 11:11.202
So Gavin finally asked
you to prom, huh?

11:11.204 --> 11:13.104
No, instead he asked her

11:13.106 --> 11:15.626
to carry a pig through mud while
people through tomatoes at her.

11:17.043 --> 11:19.611
I guess I don't need
this dress anymore.

11:19.613 --> 11:22.614
I'm really sorry, honey. I know
how important prom was to you.

11:22.616 --> 11:26.885
But on the bright side, now you can
return the dress and get your money back.

11:26.887 --> 11:30.155
You always know just
what to say, dad.

11:31.158 --> 11:33.992
Don't be too upset about prom.

11:33.994 --> 11:35.460
At least you're not
going with Chuck.

11:35.462 --> 11:38.263
He keeps sending me
weird love poems.

11:38.265 --> 11:41.266
"I'm so glad my
prom date is you,

11:41.268 --> 11:44.035
no one's more beautiful
than my trishy-poo."

11:44.037 --> 11:46.271
Aww!

11:46.273 --> 11:49.174
I mean, ew.

11:51.110 --> 11:52.377
We've rented our tuxes.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.546
And a llama to take
us to the prom.

11:54.548 --> 11:55.980
Whoo!

11:55.982 --> 11:57.949
You were supposed to get a limo.

11:57.951 --> 12:02.287
Oh. I was wondering how we were
all going to fit on the llama.

12:06.359 --> 12:08.193
Ally, it's happening!

12:08.195 --> 12:10.295
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

12:19.105 --> 12:21.940
Ally, I know you've always
dreamed about this day.

12:21.942 --> 12:24.175
So I want to make
it special for you.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.577
Will you do me the honor of
letting me take you to your prom?

12:30.216 --> 12:32.183
That's the part where
you say "yes."

12:33.652 --> 12:35.653
I can't.

12:35.655 --> 12:37.255
I'm sorry.

12:43.964 --> 12:46.297
I'm guessing you don't
want a copy of this.

12:51.370 --> 12:54.172
So what was that about?

12:54.174 --> 12:58.076
All you've been talking about the last
month is Gavin asking you to prom.

12:58.078 --> 12:59.144
I know.

12:59.146 --> 13:03.181
It's just that after our last talk
I'm not sure Gavin's right for me.

13:03.183 --> 13:04.682
Because of the pig mud run?

13:04.684 --> 13:06.317
It's more than that.

13:06.319 --> 13:09.721
He also invited me to
a chicken mud run.

13:09.723 --> 13:11.122
It's the same thing.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.423
But with chickens.

13:14.160 --> 13:16.227
So are you going to
break up with him?

13:16.229 --> 13:18.096
I don't know.

13:18.098 --> 13:20.965
I'm going to tell him to go
to the pig mud run without me

13:20.967 --> 13:23.268
so I have some time to think.

13:23.270 --> 13:27.372
All I know is I'd rather stay home
than go to prom with the wrong guy.

13:27.374 --> 13:28.640
I hear you.

13:28.642 --> 13:30.608
I wish I was going with
Jace instead of Chuck.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.343
He won't leave me alone.

13:32.345 --> 13:35.113
And his poems are getting worse.

13:35.115 --> 13:38.483
"I've got a new girl,
her name is Trish,

13:38.485 --> 13:41.052
I lie awake dreaming
of our first kish."

13:41.054 --> 13:44.389
There is no way I'm kishing him.

13:49.762 --> 13:51.729
Did you get one with my phone?

13:51.731 --> 13:54.165
Make sure you use the flash. I
look better in bright light.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.366
Make sure you get my good side.

13:55.368 --> 13:57.602
And my other good side.

13:57.604 --> 14:00.104
Take another one with mine.
I think I blinked.

14:00.106 --> 14:03.308
Ooh, let's do one
with silly faces.

14:03.310 --> 14:07.045
I've been doing silly
faces the whole time.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.279
Okay, we're done.

14:10.116 --> 14:12.250
Ah, I love that dress, Carrie.

14:12.252 --> 14:14.419
Thanks, it's so tight
I can't sit down.

14:14.421 --> 14:18.656
But it was the only one I could
find in my favorite color.

14:18.658 --> 14:21.192
She had to stand up in the
limo on the way over here.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.768
Good thing they had a sunroof.

14:22.799 --> 14:25.129
That explains the tree
branch in your hair.

14:25.131 --> 14:27.532
No, I put that there
to hold my hair up.

14:29.201 --> 14:31.135
What do you think
of Trish's corsage?

14:31.137 --> 14:33.171
I grew it myself.

14:33.173 --> 14:35.440
That's right. I garden.

14:35.442 --> 14:37.508
I also woodwork.

14:37.510 --> 14:40.111
I'm going to use my dance
winnings to buy new tools.

14:40.113 --> 14:43.147
You guys really didn't
need to stop by here.

14:43.149 --> 14:44.649
We wanted to see you.

14:44.651 --> 14:46.517
Feels weird going to
prom without you.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.486
Are you sure you don't
want to come with us?

14:48.488 --> 14:50.188
Yeah, Ally. You
already have a dress.

14:50.190 --> 14:51.522
We'll wait for you to get ready.

14:51.524 --> 14:53.424
Seriously? That
could take hours.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.226
Look at her hair.

14:56.428 --> 14:59.497
Ally, don't listen to him.

14:59.499 --> 15:01.165
You look great.

15:01.167 --> 15:02.300
You always look great.

15:06.238 --> 15:10.074
Um, did those two use
to have a thing?

15:10.076 --> 15:13.211
Long story short...
Austin first met Ally

15:13.213 --> 15:15.513
on an unseasonably
warm summer afternoon.

15:15.515 --> 15:19.350
Austin was playing the drums when
Ally said, "don't you see the..."

15:19.352 --> 15:20.551
They had a thing. It's over.

15:20.553 --> 15:23.388
Huh. Got it.

15:23.390 --> 15:25.423
You going to be okay
here by yourself?

15:25.425 --> 15:27.125
I'll be fine.

15:27.127 --> 15:29.160
I want you all to have
a fun time without me.

15:29.162 --> 15:31.195
We always do.

15:49.114 --> 15:50.448
Aww!

15:50.450 --> 15:51.716
I wish Ally was here.

15:51.718 --> 15:53.384
She would have loved
this manatee candle.

15:53.386 --> 15:55.586
She loves candles. And manatees.

15:55.588 --> 15:57.655
Especially when they're
shaped like manatees.

15:57.657 --> 16:00.825
That's the fifth time
you've brought up Ally.

16:00.827 --> 16:02.760
In the limo, you kept on saying

16:02.762 --> 16:06.230
how much she loves long cars
and bench-style seating?

16:06.232 --> 16:07.899
We're really good friends.

16:07.901 --> 16:10.435
And I feel bad she's not
here to enjoy all this.

16:10.437 --> 16:12.704
And you're sure that's it?

16:12.706 --> 16:14.339
I know you guys used to go out.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.174
That's ancient history.

16:17.242 --> 16:19.544
The point is I'm with you now.

16:19.546 --> 16:21.346
And I'm really happy.

16:21.348 --> 16:23.314
I'm really happy too.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.683
Hey, what do you say we
go get our picture taken?

16:25.685 --> 16:27.218
Good idea.

16:27.220 --> 16:29.253
My hair looks best
an hour after I gel.

16:34.728 --> 16:36.728
Hey, babe, do you want me
to cut your food for you?

16:36.730 --> 16:38.763
She can't sit because
of her dress.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.431
So you're just going
to stand all night?

16:40.433 --> 16:41.766
It's no big deal.

16:41.768 --> 16:43.768
I stand all the time.
I'm really good at it.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.503
Wait a minute.

16:45.505 --> 16:48.120
If you can't move in that dress,
how are you going to dance?

16:48.151 --> 16:49.151
Like this.

16:52.177 --> 16:53.811
Babe, you're the best.

16:53.813 --> 16:57.548
But I'm going to lose the competition
because of your stupid, beautiful dress.

16:58.951 --> 17:02.387
Trish, I'm really happy
you asked me to prom.

17:02.389 --> 17:06.858
When sun hee and I broke
up, I was so hurt.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.227
But then we got back
together, and I felt better.

17:09.229 --> 17:11.529
But then we broke up again.

17:11.531 --> 17:14.432
And I was so hurt again.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.667
But now, here you are.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.971
And I feel better. Again!

17:23.474 --> 17:25.542
- Jace?
- Huh?

17:25.545 --> 17:27.244
Ooh, I said face.

17:27.247 --> 17:29.380
There's something on your face.

17:29.382 --> 17:30.622
Here, I'll go get you a napkin.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.754
Jace, what are you doing here?

17:36.756 --> 17:38.823
Trish, you look so beautiful.

17:40.527 --> 17:42.516
I just wanted to surprise you.
There's no way

17:42.528 --> 17:44.529
I was leaving my girl
alone on prom night.

17:44.531 --> 17:46.264
I'm not alone.

17:46.266 --> 17:48.299
Because you're here now.

17:48.301 --> 17:50.968
But I was alone
before you got here.

17:50.970 --> 17:54.672
Completely, totally by myself.

17:54.674 --> 17:56.741
Well, I'm here now. Let's
get something to drink.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.443
Oh, that'd be nice.

17:58.445 --> 18:00.244
But you know what
would be nicer?

18:00.246 --> 18:01.612
You getting it for me.

18:01.614 --> 18:06.148
Ah, might be kind of hard to carry a
drink with my crutches and all, but...

18:06.179 --> 18:06.751
Thanks!

18:06.753 --> 18:08.453
Surprise!

18:08.455 --> 18:11.255
You have no idea how hard it was
not to tell you Jace was coming.

18:11.257 --> 18:12.623
Whoo!

18:12.625 --> 18:14.425
You knew about this?

18:14.427 --> 18:15.960
Yep, for a whole week.

18:15.962 --> 18:18.396
And you said I couldn't
keep a secret. Ha!

18:38.283 --> 18:39.450
You okay, hon?

18:39.452 --> 18:44.589
I'm hanging out here by myself
while my best friends are at prom.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.991
Why wouldn't I be okay?

18:46.993 --> 18:48.926
Look...

18:48.928 --> 18:52.029
I get you not wanting to go
to prom with the wrong guy.

18:52.031 --> 18:53.998
So why don't you go with me?

18:54.000 --> 18:56.467
I mean, I went with
my mother to prom.

18:58.036 --> 18:59.036
Ew.

18:59.038 --> 19:01.539
I mean, aww!

19:01.541 --> 19:03.641
No, I definitely mean "ew."

19:03.643 --> 19:06.811
Okay, okay, but you
should still go.

19:06.813 --> 19:09.413
So you don't have a date... you could
still have fun with your friends.

19:09.415 --> 19:11.516
Maybe you're right.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.651
Go! Have a great time.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.353
I'll even pay for your dress.

19:15.355 --> 19:16.954
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:16.956 --> 19:19.857
You know what...

19:19.859 --> 19:22.059
I'm going to do it. I'm
going to go to prom.

19:22.928 --> 19:27.999
See, that smile on your face
is worth way more than...

19:28.001 --> 19:29.567
$20.

19:29.569 --> 19:31.903
That says $220.

19:31.905 --> 19:33.037
- What?
- Thanks, dad.

19:33.039 --> 19:34.772
- You're the best.
- Wait.

19:39.444 --> 19:41.512
We make such a cute couple.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.014
This picture came out great.

19:43.016 --> 19:44.549
I would hope so.

19:44.551 --> 19:47.385
You made that guy
retake it 17 times.

19:47.387 --> 19:51.389
Well, it's not my fault that
lighting made my pores look huge.

19:51.391 --> 19:54.025
Speaking of, can I
have my compact back?

19:56.695 --> 19:57.962
I'll be right back.

19:57.964 --> 20:00.064
It's my turn to go freshen up.

20:02.701 --> 20:03.935
I need your help.

20:03.937 --> 20:06.837
I need you to distract Jace so
he doesn't find out about Chuck.

20:06.839 --> 20:08.940
Or distract Chuck so he
doesn't find out about Jace.

20:08.942 --> 20:11.542
I don't care. Just
distract somebody.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.644
Why don't you just tell
them both the truth?

20:13.646 --> 20:17.848
Because Jace will be angry I lied
and Chuck will be heartbroken.

20:17.850 --> 20:21.986
I can't believe I'm saying this, but
I don't want to break Chuck's heart.

20:21.988 --> 20:26.157
Huh... put a dress on you, and
suddenly you're all ladylike.

20:28.994 --> 20:32.063
You have no idea what it's like
to be at prom with one person

20:32.065 --> 20:34.599
when there's another person
you'd rather be with.

20:34.601 --> 20:36.467
Mm.

20:47.879 --> 20:52.149
Actually, I know exactly
what that's like.

20:53.652 --> 20:56.954
Trish, I've made a huge mistake.

20:56.956 --> 20:58.823
I'm not supposed to
be here with Piper.

20:58.825 --> 21:01.592
I'm supposed to be
here with Ally.

21:01.594 --> 21:04.929
And you're not Trish.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.897
You don't want to be
here with my sister?

21:06.899 --> 21:09.100
Please don't say
anything to Piper.

21:09.102 --> 21:10.134
I don't want to ruin her prom.

21:10.136 --> 21:13.037
You know, Austin, I'm really
glad that we're here.

21:13.039 --> 21:16.007
Even if your pores are huge.

21:17.643 --> 21:20.645
Piper, there's something
I have to tell you.

21:29.988 --> 21:31.856
Nice tux, Chuck.

21:31.858 --> 21:35.059
But it's not as sharp as mine.

21:35.061 --> 21:37.962
Please, red.

21:37.964 --> 21:42.233
My tux is so sharp, it
comes with safety goggles.

21:42.235 --> 21:44.101
Oh, yeah?

21:44.103 --> 21:49.073
My tux is so sharp, I got a
paper cut just putting it on.

21:49.075 --> 21:54.812
My tux is so sharp, Japanese chefs
use it to chop vegetables tableside.

21:58.017 --> 21:59.116
- Hu-ah!
- Ha!

22:01.853 --> 22:05.956
My tux is so sharp, teachers warn
little kids not to run with it.

22:05.958 --> 22:10.094
My tux is so sharp, instead
of pencil sharpeners,

22:10.096 --> 22:14.165
people use "pencil
my-tux-eners."

22:14.167 --> 22:16.000
Okay, that one didn't
make any sense.

22:16.002 --> 22:18.969
Eh, I'll admit that
one was a stretch.

22:18.971 --> 22:21.672
Point is...

22:21.674 --> 22:23.841
I look sharp.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.042
Now you do.
