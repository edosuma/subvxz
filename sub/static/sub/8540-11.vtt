09:38.142 --> 09:40.101
of Derek Logan.

09:40.188 --> 09:43.017
Ah, you really think Logan
laid in wait for 15 years

09:43.104 --> 09:46.020
and suddenly decided
to take revenge on Selby?

09:46.107 --> 09:49.850
Well, I think that
Logan is as angry today

09:49.937 --> 09:53.070
as he was 15 years ago,
maybe even angrier.

09:53.157 --> 09:54.419
We'll check him out.

09:54.506 --> 09:55.420
You know, I'm gonna
stick around.

09:55.507 --> 09:56.813
I-I didn't go to high school

09:56.900 --> 09:58.206
this is kind of
fascinatingfor me.

09:58.293 --> 09:59.511
You never went
to high school?

09:59.599 --> 10:00.991
- No, I was busy.
- You can stay.

10:01.078 --> 10:02.514
Just don't
make me sorry I let you.

10:04.342 --> 10:05.300
Bassoon.

10:08.085 --> 10:09.826
Mrs. Vickers,
when was the last time

10:09.913 --> 10:10.827
you spoke to your son?

10:12.786 --> 10:14.352
Um, this morning.

10:14.439 --> 10:16.616
Selby always checks
in on me before he goes to work

10:16.703 --> 10:19.662
to see how I'm doing.
He's..

10:19.749 --> 10:21.359
He was sweet like that.

10:21.446 --> 10:23.057
Were you aware of any
problems he was having?

10:23.144 --> 10:24.188
Work? Personal life?

10:24.275 --> 10:26.713
Um, no.
Just the opposite.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.802
Things were starting
to get good for him.

10:28.889 --> 10:30.542
After he left high school,
things didn't go right for him.

10:32.066 --> 10:33.807
About high school,
the prank he pulled--

10:33.894 --> 10:36.679
- I don't wanna talk about that.
- 'Ma'am.'

10:36.766 --> 10:40.204
His whole life was spoiled
by that-that incident.

10:41.553 --> 10:42.990
He lost a chance at college.

10:43.077 --> 10:45.557
He-he got stuck working
in a little print shop.

10:48.386 --> 10:51.128
And then Jana came along,
and..

10:51.215 --> 10:53.740
...and she was like a whole
new world for him.

10:56.090 --> 10:58.005
She encouraged him

10:58.092 --> 11:01.269
and she told him to-to strive
for something better

11:01.356 --> 11:04.054
and-and he became
a whole new person.

11:06.187 --> 11:08.145
We haven't been able
to track down

11:08.232 --> 11:10.104
any family for Jana.

11:10.191 --> 11:11.409
Do you know
where we can find them?

11:14.543 --> 11:15.805
She didn't have anybody.

11:15.892 --> 11:18.721
Uh, nobody that I know of.

11:18.808 --> 11:20.331
She'd moved here from Poland

11:20.418 --> 11:22.420
and Selby only met her
a couple of months ago.

11:23.944 --> 11:26.860
A few dates and...and they
got married.

11:26.947 --> 11:28.992
It was all
kind of a whirlwind.

11:31.038 --> 11:33.040
Now, Mrs. Vickers,
it's a bit unsettling

11:33.127 --> 11:35.172
but I'd like you to listen
to this message

11:35.259 --> 11:37.609
see if you recognize
the caller, is that all right?

11:37.697 --> 11:40.787
Yeah.

11:40.874 --> 11:43.180
[man on the phone recorder]
'I'm done playing games here.
You hear me?'

11:43.267 --> 11:44.878
'Either you get me my money
or I'm gonna be forced'

11:44.965 --> 11:46.444
'to take action.'

11:46.531 --> 11:48.446
[beeps]
Well, I-I've never heard

11:48.533 --> 11:50.361
that voice in my life.

11:50.448 --> 11:52.886
Was my son involved with
a loan shark or something?

11:52.973 --> 11:55.149
Could be, we traced
the phone call

11:55.236 --> 11:56.890
to a phone booth
in Gallatin.

11:56.977 --> 11:57.891
- 'That doesn't really tell us.'
- Gallatin?

11:57.978 --> 12:00.284
Th-that's where Jana's from.

12:00.371 --> 12:02.939
Uh, Se-Selby met her there
at a coffee shop

12:03.026 --> 12:04.985
when he was on
a delivery run.

12:05.072 --> 12:06.551
Can you tell us anything
about Jana

12:06.638 --> 12:08.118
before she met Selby?

12:08.205 --> 12:09.729
Maybe names of friends,
where she worked?

12:10.773 --> 12:12.601
No, all that Selby told me

12:12.688 --> 12:14.908
was that things
were tough for her.

12:14.995 --> 12:17.171
Yeah, he didn't share
any details

12:17.258 --> 12:20.609
probably, 'cause he didn't
want me making any judgments.

12:23.525 --> 12:24.613
You remember
what we used to call you?

12:25.570 --> 12:27.398
You were the frogman.

12:27.485 --> 12:29.444
Frog because you played
the French horn.

12:29.531 --> 12:31.272
Well, 'cause, you know

12:31.359 --> 12:34.144
y-you kinda sorta look like
a frog, but no offense, but..

12:34.231 --> 12:36.059
Yeah, no, I-I remember.

12:36.146 --> 12:38.148
Oh, man, we used to
get on you.

12:38.235 --> 12:39.933
You know what?
I'm sorry about that.

12:40.020 --> 12:41.978
Sincerely, but I mean,
what?

12:42.065 --> 12:43.545
We were kids, right?
We were just kids.

12:43.632 --> 12:45.329
Forget it, forget it.
I have.

12:47.070 --> 12:50.204
Dude, that-that time we put
the dead bird in his locker.

12:50.291 --> 12:51.858
Oh, we did that.

12:51.945 --> 12:54.164
Yeah, yeah, you guys
got me with that one.

12:54.251 --> 12:56.210
Does anybody still call you
that, "the frogman"?

12:56.297 --> 12:59.300
Well, pretty much everyone
calls me Phil

12:59.387 --> 13:01.345
except my son,
who calls me dad.

13:01.432 --> 13:03.478
You fathered a kid?
He fathered a..

13:03.565 --> 13:06.307
Go, frogman!
Come on. Nice!

13:06.394 --> 13:08.004
Good job.
Didn't think you had it in you.

13:08.091 --> 13:09.876
Wait. Does he play
the French horn, too?

13:11.442 --> 13:14.184
Because if he does,
you could call him frog boy

13:15.403 --> 13:17.709
or...Kermit.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.016
Or Kermie.

13:20.103 --> 13:21.975
Really good to, uh,
see you guys again.

13:23.411 --> 13:25.543
Come on, hey,
if the kid of yours

13:25.630 --> 13:27.110
ever needs any shaping up
you send him to

13:27.197 --> 13:28.851
a Cordova Sports Camp, okay?

13:28.938 --> 13:30.070
[laughter]

13:31.898 --> 13:33.421
Vodka tonic, please.

13:33.508 --> 13:35.510
- Uh, top shelf.
- 'You got it.'

13:35.597 --> 13:37.077
It's on me.

13:37.164 --> 13:38.252
Thank you.

13:40.123 --> 13:41.821
Um...you're one of the

13:41.908 --> 13:43.605
uh, one of
the CBI people.

13:44.171 --> 13:46.129
Yeah.

13:46.216 --> 13:48.349
I heard about
what happened to Selby.

13:48.436 --> 13:50.438
That's-that's awful.

13:50.525 --> 13:52.788
Hmm. Well, it doesn't appear
to have dampened the mood here.

13:54.224 --> 13:57.793
L.J. Cordova seems to be
having a great time.

13:57.880 --> 14:00.927
Yeah, frogman..

14:01.014 --> 14:02.363
[sighs]
If I could go back in time

14:02.450 --> 14:04.626
and beat the crap
out of him

14:04.713 --> 14:06.062
the first time
he called me that..

14:07.629 --> 14:09.239
It's not possible, Phil.

14:09.326 --> 14:10.458
Oh, I know.

14:12.721 --> 14:15.419
But you could
just talk to him quietly

14:15.506 --> 14:17.682
and tell him how you feel.

14:17.769 --> 14:20.511
[scoffs]
He'd probably just laugh at me.

14:20.598 --> 14:22.557
Probably.

14:22.644 --> 14:25.255
But at least you would know
that you made an effort, right?

14:25.342 --> 14:28.171
And this is a, what?
It's a 15 year school reunion.

14:28.258 --> 14:29.694
What are these reunions for,
anyway?

14:31.522 --> 14:33.002
[laughs]
I don't know.

14:33.089 --> 14:34.569
I understand.

14:34.656 --> 14:37.789
All those nights you lay there
not being able to sleep

14:37.877 --> 14:40.531
thinking about whether or not
you should've confronted him.

14:40.618 --> 14:41.750
It's tough.

14:44.100 --> 14:45.188
You know what?

14:47.147 --> 14:48.365
[clicks tongue]
You're right.

14:50.454 --> 14:51.586
You go, Phil.

14:54.589 --> 14:57.548
- Hey, L.J.
- What up, frog?

14:57.635 --> 14:58.636
[Stu]
'What's your problem, man?'

15:00.334 --> 15:03.641
- Oh, phil.
- Stop, come on.

15:03.728 --> 15:05.426
- Get off me!
- Come on. What are you..

15:05.513 --> 15:07.167
Phil.

15:07.254 --> 15:08.255
[grunting]

15:09.734 --> 15:10.910
[glass shatters]

15:11.998 --> 15:14.043
Oh! Oh!

15:14.130 --> 15:15.262
[man grunting]

15:16.393 --> 15:17.481
- Aah!
- Oh! Oh.

15:19.744 --> 15:22.269
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

15:22.356 --> 15:25.663
- You get off, now!
- Aah! Ohh! Get off! Get off!

15:25.750 --> 15:27.448
[female #1]
Come here! Get off!

15:27.535 --> 15:29.363
[glass shatters]

15:34.324 --> 15:35.412
[instrumental music]

15:43.551 --> 15:46.946
You know, this thing is
a golden treasury of mullets.

15:47.033 --> 15:48.469
A brawl?

15:48.556 --> 15:50.210
You started a brawl?
Come on.

15:50.297 --> 15:51.907
Well, I was, uh,
I was going for something

15:51.994 --> 15:54.866
a little more contained
but I guess people

15:54.954 --> 15:56.825
just wanted to explore
the physical.

15:56.912 --> 15:58.653
And what information
did you glean?

15:58.740 --> 16:00.960
I assume you were testing
some theory or other?

16:01.047 --> 16:03.049
Wow, Willa Brock
was involved

16:03.136 --> 16:06.356
in eight different school
activities and she looked

16:06.443 --> 16:08.271
pretty good in cargo pants
which is hard to do.

16:08.358 --> 16:10.491
There are people
in the hospital.

16:10.578 --> 16:13.494
Yes, but souls were healed.
This was a cathartic brawl.

16:13.581 --> 16:16.192
It was-it was
a therapeutic expression of..

16:16.279 --> 16:17.889
[footsteps]

16:17.977 --> 16:20.153
- Please.
- Got a lead.

16:20.240 --> 16:21.632
Jana's INS entry records

16:21.719 --> 16:24.113
list a Gallatin address
as her destination.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.289
The property and residence
of a Terence Badali.

16:26.376 --> 16:28.639
No real sheet, but he had
a couple restraining orders

16:28.726 --> 16:31.120
from women back in the '90s.
He could be our angry caller.

16:31.207 --> 16:32.600
Go to Gallatin.
Take Van Pelt with you.

16:32.687 --> 16:34.036
Okay.

16:34.123 --> 16:36.604
You go to hell.
Take a toothbrush.

16:36.691 --> 16:38.127
Which way is that?

16:38.867 --> 16:39.999
I'll go.

16:42.088 --> 16:43.872
[laughs]

16:43.959 --> 16:45.569
What's so funny?

16:45.656 --> 16:46.744
"If I want culture

16:46.831 --> 16:48.137
I'll leave my yogurt
out overnight."

16:48.224 --> 16:49.443
L.J. Cordova's
yearbook photo quote.

16:50.922 --> 16:52.620
Well, when you're done
entertaining yourself

16:52.707 --> 16:54.839
I got your Derek Logan
update right here.

16:54.926 --> 16:56.885
Ah.

16:56.972 --> 16:59.018
Kid's life never turned
the corner.

16:59.105 --> 17:01.498
Derek Michael Logan
left Rancho Rosa

17:01.585 --> 17:03.326
a couple weeks
after the Selby incident.

17:03.413 --> 17:06.286
Family moved to Virginia.
He became a heroin addict.

17:06.373 --> 17:08.462
Couple years
in and out of rehab.

17:08.549 --> 17:10.812
He died of an overdose
on his 23rd birthday.

17:10.899 --> 17:13.858
School office has sent over
his old student ID.

17:13.945 --> 17:15.599
- From their archives?
- Mm-hmm.

17:15.686 --> 17:18.167
[Patrick]
'Hmm, he kind
of looks like you.'

17:18.254 --> 17:20.778
And, uh, this is
the photo of the incident

17:20.865 --> 17:23.172
that, uh, Selby plastered
around the school.

17:23.259 --> 17:25.087
How does any kid recover
from that?

17:28.569 --> 17:29.918
Well, in this case,
they don't.

17:30.005 --> 17:31.311
Mm.

17:31.398 --> 17:33.835
- How sad.
- 'Mm.'

17:33.922 --> 17:35.837
And I was betting
on Derek Logan as our killer.

17:37.230 --> 17:38.709
Will you quit yanking
me around?

17:38.796 --> 17:40.146
Okay, if you can't get it right,
we're through.

17:40.233 --> 17:42.496
Now the order
was for 5/16th beech wood

17:42.583 --> 17:44.628
not for 5/16th warped
beech wood.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.067
Hey, Terence Badali?
CBI.

17:48.154 --> 17:50.112
Need to talk to you about
Jana Vickers.

17:50.199 --> 17:52.332
I'll call you back.
What about her?

17:52.419 --> 17:53.463
You left
a threatening message

17:53.550 --> 17:55.465
on her answering machine
recently.

17:55.552 --> 17:57.032
Well, how do you know
it was me?

17:57.119 --> 17:59.513
Because an innocent person
would say, I didn't do it.

17:59.600 --> 18:00.905
So what? I called her.
Big deal.

18:00.992 --> 18:02.646
You called her
and threatened her

18:02.733 --> 18:05.214
now she and her husband have
been found killed, and so..

18:05.301 --> 18:06.433
[screams]

18:14.049 --> 18:15.181
[grunts]

18:16.486 --> 18:17.618
You're under arrest.

18:19.402 --> 18:21.143
[groans]

18:24.146 --> 18:25.452
I panicked.

18:25.539 --> 18:26.757
As soon as you told me they
were dead

18:26.844 --> 18:27.802
I knew you were gonna
blame me

18:27.889 --> 18:29.499
and my brain said, "just run."

18:29.586 --> 18:31.893
Your brain's a fool.
Where were you last night?

18:31.980 --> 18:33.112
I was watching college ball.

18:35.810 --> 18:37.116
Can you prove that?

18:37.203 --> 18:38.291
Notre Dame sucked.

18:41.685 --> 18:42.991
I live alone..

18:43.078 --> 18:44.775
...since that polish
bitch left me.

18:44.862 --> 18:46.777
She and you had
a sexual relationship?

18:46.864 --> 18:49.040
Well, she was my fiancee.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.477
I met her through
this Internet service.

18:50.564 --> 18:52.131
Uh, you-you pay
a whole bunch of money

18:52.218 --> 18:54.307
but you get to choose from
these videos and then they bring

18:54.394 --> 18:56.178
her over to the country
and she marries you.

18:56.265 --> 18:58.180
- That's a good deal.
- Oh, I tell you, man.

18:58.267 --> 18:59.616
These Eastern European types

18:59.703 --> 19:01.879
they know how to take care
of their men.

19:01.966 --> 19:03.577
Right. What happened?

19:03.664 --> 19:05.840
Well, she left me for
this Vickers guy.

19:05.927 --> 19:07.929
She comes to me one day
says she met this guy at work

19:08.016 --> 19:09.670
they fell in love..

19:09.757 --> 19:11.933
- Must've made you angry.
- 'Yeah, you bet it did.'

19:12.020 --> 19:13.630
So you threaten to kill them
unless they pay you off.

19:13.717 --> 19:16.981
No, no, no. I threatened
to turn her in to the INS.

19:17.068 --> 19:19.897
Because she had lied about
all these things on her form.

19:19.984 --> 19:22.073
She was in this country
under false pretenses.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.510
How much
were you asking for?

19:23.597 --> 19:25.033
Well, I just wanted
my money back.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.209
The money I put up
to get her over here.

19:27.296 --> 19:30.299
I saved all my receipts.
It was 25 grand.

19:30.386 --> 19:32.171
Well, and 5 grand
for emotional suffering.

19:32.258 --> 19:33.215
And what was her response?

19:33.302 --> 19:34.564
She said they'd pay it.

19:34.651 --> 19:35.826
She admitted she owed
me the money.

19:35.913 --> 19:37.219
They were broke.

19:37.306 --> 19:39.134
Any idea where they were
gonna get the money?

19:39.221 --> 19:40.744
Jana said that Selby was gonna
get it from an old friend.

19:42.224 --> 19:43.399
They guaranteed Badali
they'd have it

19:43.486 --> 19:45.401
for him Monday in cash.

19:45.488 --> 19:48.230
At least we know Selby's
sudden interest in the reunion.

19:48.317 --> 19:51.059
He was protecting his wife.
It's kind of romantic.

19:51.146 --> 19:53.322
- Noble, even.
- Ugh. Motive, even.

19:53.409 --> 19:55.194
He must have asked
somebody for money

19:55.281 --> 19:56.978
who really didn't
like him asking.

19:57.065 --> 19:58.762
Yeah, nice work, Grace.

19:58.849 --> 20:00.982
I need to see that list of all
the reunion attendees'

20:01.069 --> 20:02.026
arrival times.

20:03.027 --> 20:05.421
Oh, yeah. Here you go.

20:05.508 --> 20:06.857
Thanks.

20:06.944 --> 20:09.512
So, uh, you and Cho saw
some action, huh?

20:09.599 --> 20:11.253
- Little bit, yeah.
- That's cool.

20:12.776 --> 20:14.517
You have Gabe Nyland
arriving by plane

20:14.604 --> 20:16.824
the day before the murder.
Are you sure that's right?

20:16.911 --> 20:18.913
Yeah, there's an airfield
in Stratton the next town over.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.350
I checked the arrival logs,
he flew in by private jet.

20:21.437 --> 20:23.744
Be careful who you vote for
for lieutenant governor.

20:23.831 --> 20:25.224
One of the candidates lies.

'Yes?'

20:39.281 --> 20:41.327
It's agent Lisbon
and Patrick Jane.

20:41.414 --> 20:43.459
We just have a few
follow-up questions for you.

20:49.378 --> 20:51.119
Hi. How can I help?

20:51.206 --> 20:54.427
Last night at the reception,
you said you'd just gotten in

20:54.514 --> 20:57.604
but we know you flew
in the day before the murders.

20:57.691 --> 20:59.214
Can you explain
the discrepancy for us?

21:01.564 --> 21:02.652
Come on in.

21:05.220 --> 21:07.266
I came a day early for
a private fundraising dinner.

21:08.963 --> 21:10.747
I said I'd just arrived
because I didn't want

21:10.834 --> 21:12.445
my classmates thinking

21:12.532 --> 21:14.882
I'm up here shilling
during reunion weekend.

21:14.969 --> 21:18.015
Nice room. Is it the, uh,
Presidential suite?

21:20.235 --> 21:22.281
Something like that.

21:22.368 --> 21:25.022
Is the bedroom nice?
How's the mattress?

21:25.109 --> 21:26.676
Uh, it's adequate.

21:26.763 --> 21:27.938
- Can I see it?
- Well, no.

21:28.025 --> 21:29.853
- Why would you want to?
- Why not?

21:29.940 --> 21:31.290
Because I'm entitled
to my privacy.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.250
Hey!

21:36.512 --> 21:37.731
Whoa.

21:37.818 --> 21:38.949
Hello again.

21:39.863 --> 21:40.821
Hi.

21:50.091 --> 21:51.788
There was no inappropriate
relationship.

21:51.875 --> 21:54.008
You call it
an inappropriate relationship.

21:54.095 --> 21:57.403
The law calls it
soliciting sex from a minor.

21:57.490 --> 21:59.056
She came to my door.

21:59.143 --> 22:00.580
Had an idea
she wanted to discuss

22:00.667 --> 22:03.322
about a youth voter effort
for my campaign.

22:03.409 --> 22:05.149
I'm not going to discourage
some enthusiastic kid

22:05.236 --> 22:06.368
who wants to get involved.

22:06.455 --> 22:08.675
No, no. You hide 'em
in your bedroom.

22:08.762 --> 22:10.198
I had to.

22:10.285 --> 22:12.592
Media people follow me
everywhere I go now.

22:12.679 --> 22:14.855
If I open that door and it's
some guerrilla photographer

22:14.942 --> 22:16.030

on the internet

22:16.117 --> 22:17.640
both of our lives
are ruined.

22:17.727 --> 22:19.642
You're very good at this.

even though it holds no water.

22:23.516 --> 22:25.300
Explains why you're
such a successful DA

22:26.562 --> 22:27.868
It's the truth.

22:27.955 --> 22:29.478
Well, that should
be easy to confirm.

22:29.565 --> 22:32.089
Lisbon, could you have
the social worker

22:32.176 --> 22:33.700
bring, uh, Tess in, please?

22:33.787 --> 22:34.962
No, please.

22:38.052 --> 22:41.098
This is on me.
She didn't ask for any of this.

22:41.185 --> 22:43.449
You care about her.

22:43.536 --> 22:46.016
You genuinely care
about her.

22:46.103 --> 22:47.931
Well, she's very friendly..

22:48.018 --> 22:49.237
...and diplomatic.

22:51.587 --> 22:53.241
Diplomatic..

22:53.328 --> 22:56.375
...and evasive,
like a politician..

22:56.462 --> 22:57.419
...like her father.

That and you have

aren't they?

'She's your daughter?'

23:11.477 --> 23:14.610
Her mother was
a year behind me.

23:14.697 --> 23:17.831
Tess was born a few weeks
before I graduated.

23:17.918 --> 23:20.399
Families agreed
to keep it quiet.

23:20.486 --> 23:21.878
But I've always done
right by Tess.

23:21.965 --> 23:24.141
Come out to see her
whenever I can.

23:24.228 --> 23:25.447
Discreetly, of course.

23:25.534 --> 23:28.319
Did you ever see, Selby
when you visited?

23:28.407 --> 23:30.278
Last year, at a gas station
just outside of town

23:30.365 --> 23:32.976
We said a quick hello,
went our separate ways.

23:33.063 --> 23:35.326
Maybe Selby found
out about Tess.

23:35.414 --> 23:36.893
Threatened to expose you.

23:36.980 --> 23:40.854
Not Selby Vickers.
He wouldn't threaten a fly.

23:40.941 --> 23:42.551
A super nice guy.

23:42.638 --> 23:44.248
He tried to do right
by people.

23:44.335 --> 23:46.294
What'd you talk about
with Selby at the gas station?

23:46.381 --> 23:48.383
Small talk. I told him,
I was gonna run

23:48.470 --> 23:50.516
for lieutenant governor
and he offered

23:50.603 --> 23:52.605
to print the campaign flyers,
free of charge.

23:52.692 --> 23:54.084
Was he the same way
in high school?

23:54.171 --> 23:56.609
Always.
Help you with your homework

23:56.696 --> 23:58.219
he'd share his lunch with you

23:58.306 --> 24:01.657
he was just happy
knowing that you liked him.

24:01.744 --> 24:06.009
Even that thing with Logan,
he just did it to be popular.

24:06.096 --> 24:08.969
I've answered
all your questions.

24:09.056 --> 24:10.144

- Oh, Sorry.

Oh, yes.
That's-that's a tragedy.

26:47.997 --> 26:50.652

27:01.315 --> 27:03.012
He was off.

27:03.099 --> 27:05.232
"off" isn't tolerated
in high school.

27:05.319 --> 27:08.235
Well, certainly not in the 30
years I've been doing this job.

27:13.109 --> 27:15.024
Right over there
is where it all happened.

27:17.244 --> 27:19.942
Derek's folks sent him to
a shrink afterwards.

I heard of him.

Did Selby ever give
a reason why he did it?

You know, I asked him,
but he just shrugged.

27:55.282 --> 27:58.546
Yes. He heard his attacker's
voice, though.

27:58.633 --> 28:01.114
He thought it sounded
like Selby.

28:01.201 --> 28:03.594
I confronted Selby.
He confessed quite readily

28:03.682 --> 28:07.947
like the helpful,
honest boy he usually was.

28:08.034 --> 28:09.339
It's very strange.

that showed up to the reunion?

28:19.349 --> 28:20.394
Yes, I do.

28:20.481 --> 28:22.091
And how would I do that?

28:22.178 --> 28:24.485
It's easy.
You build a memory palace.

28:24.572 --> 28:26.574
Um, I thought that was just
some card player's trick.

28:26.661 --> 28:28.315
Well, it's multipurpose.

28:28.402 --> 28:30.883
It's perfect for recalling
a large body of information.

28:30.970 --> 28:34.190
All you need is a physical
location that you know well.

28:34.277 --> 28:37.672
And you break it down in your
mind into smaller pieces

28:37.759 --> 28:42.633
and link each one to a package
of the information..

28:42.721 --> 28:43.765
Like this.

And so on and so forth.

29:12.402 --> 29:13.708
Okay.

29:13.795 --> 29:16.189
When you want to
remember the details

29:16.276 --> 29:19.845
you close your eyes,
and in your mind

29:19.932 --> 29:22.761
you walk around
your very own memory palace.

29:25.111 --> 29:27.548
Yeah, but I-I can't learn all
this in just a couple of hours.

29:27.635 --> 29:29.332
It comes very quickly
once you get the hang of it

29:29.419 --> 29:31.247
and they'll be
wearing nametags.

29:31.334 --> 29:32.814

why would I memorize all these--

40:09.494 --> 40:12.584
And Selby and Jana Vickers
had to die, too.

40:12.671 --> 40:15.108
Selby falls for
that little polish girl

40:15.195 --> 40:18.851
and suddenly grows a spine?

40:18.938 --> 40:20.287
Things would have been perfect

40:20.374 --> 40:24.160
if he just stayed
lonely and pathetic.

40:25.510 --> 40:27.642
Close call.
If she'd have destroyed

40:27.729 --> 40:29.296
the negative that Selby
had given her

40:29.383 --> 40:31.080
we'd have no evidence
and no case.

40:31.167 --> 40:32.647
It was a trophy.

40:32.734 --> 40:34.301
It was a reminder
that the great Willa Brock

40:34.388 --> 40:36.085
can crush anyone
that dares stand in her way

40:36.172 --> 40:37.783
just like 15 years ago.

40:37.870 --> 40:40.481
Yes, yes. Nobody advances
an inch from high school.

40:40.568 --> 40:42.962
- You proved your point.
- Their instincts never change.

40:46.792 --> 40:48.663
Selby and Derek
would both be grateful.

40:48.750 --> 40:50.099
You two have
an open invitation

40:50.186 --> 40:52.450
if you want to
join us at the 20th.

40:52.537 --> 40:54.669
Hopefully,
we won't need to.

40:54.756 --> 40:57.672
Keep it in the dojo, Phil.

40:57.759 --> 40:59.326
One thing I don't get.

40:59.413 --> 41:02.285
How did you persuade Rigsby
to play this charade?

41:02.372 --> 41:06.333
I told him that you promised
to give him Monday off.

41:06.420 --> 41:09.075
Not happening.

41:10.729 --> 41:13.819
Well, that puts me
in an awkward position.

41:13.906 --> 41:15.647
I-I-I-I held up my end
of the bargain.

41:15.734 --> 41:17.213
[Extreme singing
"More Than Words"]

41:17.300 --> 41:22.088
- Oh, god. I loved this song.
- Loved this song.

41:22.175 --> 41:24.090
- I used to love this song.
- You love this song.

41:24.177 --> 41:27.310
- Yeah.
- Obviously, you want to dance.

41:27.397 --> 41:29.748
- With you? No.
- Oh, come on.

41:29.835 --> 41:32.446

I'm that mean, cold-hearted guy

41:32.533 --> 41:36.145
