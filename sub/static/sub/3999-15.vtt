WEBVTT

00:18.118 --> 00:20.152
(British accent):
Hello!
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:20.154 --> 00:22.855
Happy St. Valentine's Day,
mates.

00:22.857 --> 00:27.292
I just spent the week at Ryan's,
and it was absolutely lovely.

00:27.294 --> 00:28.527
COACH:
Fake accent,

00:28.529 --> 00:30.696
smug attitude--
this is exactly why

00:30.698 --> 00:32.731
the teachers
have turned on Jyan.

00:32.733 --> 00:35.067
Jyan?! Come on!

00:35.069 --> 00:37.836
You chose the worst parts
of both our names.

00:37.838 --> 00:39.805
That's why we chose it.
Haters gonna "H."

00:39.807 --> 00:41.807
That's why Ryan
has to find a new job.

00:41.809 --> 00:43.409
You know, I hear Elijah Wood's
looking for a stunt double.

00:43.411 --> 00:45.010
(laughter)

00:45.012 --> 00:46.578
He's so small!

00:46.580 --> 00:48.147
Get back in that tree
and make me some cookies, Ryan!

00:48.149 --> 00:49.181
Cookies!
- WINSTON:
Yeah!

00:49.183 --> 00:51.250
I know, so hot, right?

00:52.652 --> 00:55.320
Anyway, what's going on
in your little lives?

00:55.322 --> 00:57.056
Well, I'm just enjoying
the fruits of dating

00:57.058 --> 00:58.490
a semi-powerful
local politician.

00:58.492 --> 00:59.825
Tonight,
it's a Valentine's Day

00:59.827 --> 01:01.560
cardiologists' soiree.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.328
Check that out.
- Oh!

01:03.330 --> 01:05.431
Oh, my goodness.
Is that the invitation?

01:05.433 --> 01:07.199
Wait, that's a real heart?
Looks like meat.

01:07.201 --> 01:09.068
It's not shaped
like this?
- Yeah, well, you know,

01:09.070 --> 01:10.436
the cardiologists feel

01:10.438 --> 01:12.404
that the traditional
cartoon heart, uh...

01:12.406 --> 01:14.406
promotes ignorance.
That's gross.

01:14.408 --> 01:16.742
Where's Nick? How is he handling
the breakup with Kai?

01:16.744 --> 01:18.544
I don't know-- I haven't seen
Fat Fat Fatty in a long time.

01:18.546 --> 01:20.345
Yeah, me, either.
Yeah, I haven't seen
him since the breakup.

01:20.347 --> 01:22.181
You live in
the same room as him.

01:22.183 --> 01:23.549
I've been crashing in your room
while you're away.

01:23.551 --> 01:24.750
Is Nick missing?

01:24.752 --> 01:26.852
No, he is not.

01:26.854 --> 01:28.253
Oh, boy.
(chuckles): Hey.

01:28.255 --> 01:29.555
SCHMIDT: Oh, wow.
COACH: You look terrible.

01:29.557 --> 01:31.290
Hey, Nick.
Are you covered in gravy?

01:31.292 --> 01:35.227
Nope. I've been in my room
for the last week sleeping

01:35.229 --> 01:36.762
and thinking

01:36.764 --> 01:39.865
and really getting into
the comic strip<i> Cathy.</i>

01:39.867 --> 01:42.734
Oh, so really excited that we
can finally talk about<i> Cathy.</i>

01:42.736 --> 01:44.069
When she's mad, she says, "Ack."

01:44.071 --> 01:45.471
Ack.
- Ack.

01:45.473 --> 01:47.106
Ack!
- Nick, why would you
come out here?

01:47.108 --> 01:48.941
Sounds like you were doing
pretty good in there.

01:48.943 --> 01:50.209
Doug's Ale House.

01:50.211 --> 01:53.579
The new bar on Sixth and Spring?
No.

01:53.581 --> 01:56.415
The exact coordinates
to complete my bar crawl

01:56.417 --> 01:59.384
that I've been working on
for almost a decade.

01:59.386 --> 02:00.486
What?!
- Ooh.

02:00.488 --> 02:01.753
SCHMIDT:
Big day.
- Thanks.

02:01.755 --> 02:03.055
And guess what? Good news.

02:03.057 --> 02:04.957
(imitates drumroll)

02:04.959 --> 02:06.959
It's tonight! Who's in?

02:06.961 --> 02:09.161
Oh...
WINSTON: You know, I'm on call
at the station tonight,

02:09.163 --> 02:10.496
so I can't really drink, so...

02:10.498 --> 02:12.331
Fawn's speaking
at a cardiologist event.

02:12.333 --> 02:14.466
Ryan and I have a reservation at
a really fancy restaurant, so...

02:14.468 --> 02:15.801
You're probably thinking,

02:15.803 --> 02:18.303
"Oh, a bar crawl
on Valentine's Day--

02:18.305 --> 02:21.607
is this about Nick's breakup
with Kai?" No.

02:21.609 --> 02:23.275
Yeah.
- Now you might be
asking yourself,

02:23.277 --> 02:25.844
"Is attendance
really mandatory?"

02:25.846 --> 02:27.880
You bet it is.

02:28.915 --> 02:30.282
Bar crawl!

02:30.284 --> 02:31.917
Hmm.

02:31.919 --> 02:33.952
He's about to crack.
We have to go tonight.

02:33.954 --> 02:35.854
So I have news about a bar cr...

02:35.856 --> 02:38.524
Was I just out here talking
to you guys about the bar crawl?

02:38.526 --> 02:40.325
Did I already
pitch it all to you?

02:40.327 --> 02:42.895
Well, it's happening tonight!

02:50.637 --> 02:54.273
Okay, so we hit six bars
in five hours.

02:54.275 --> 02:55.774
Wait, wouldn't six hours
make more sense?

02:55.776 --> 02:57.509
Yeah, that'd make sense
'cause it all divides...

02:57.511 --> 02:59.478
No, no, it doesn't,
because it's...

02:59.480 --> 03:01.180
it's five hours.

03:01.182 --> 03:03.115
Now, the amazing thing is,

03:03.117 --> 03:06.552
if you connect all
the coordinates, the six bars

03:06.554 --> 03:09.655
form a perfect smiley face
on the map-- look.

03:09.657 --> 03:11.190
You didn't actually connect
all the coordinates.

03:11.192 --> 03:12.624
Oh, my...
- WINSTON:
Hey, I think

03:12.626 --> 03:15.127
it is a really
cool smiley face.

03:15.129 --> 03:17.362
Thank you.
- I got your back, man.
I got your back.

03:17.364 --> 03:19.198
Actually, I have
all your backs, all right?

03:19.200 --> 03:21.733
Uh, since I can't drink tonight,
I am your designated buddy.

03:21.735 --> 03:25.137
Here in my backpack,
I have a list of items

03:25.139 --> 03:26.572
that we may need.

03:26.574 --> 03:28.540
I got water, so...

03:28.542 --> 03:30.475
I got towels for everybody.
Perfect.

03:30.477 --> 03:32.044
I got... small stick.

03:32.046 --> 03:34.079
Speaks for itself.
Oh.

03:34.081 --> 03:37.049
Oh. Also... one female condom.

03:37.051 --> 03:39.351
It's gonna go quick, so I'll let
you two fight it out.

03:39.353 --> 03:41.186
CECE: Uh-uh.
- Also, I got

03:41.188 --> 03:43.355
tissues for you,
Nick, 'cause...
- What for?

03:43.357 --> 03:45.157
It's-it's Valentine's Day,
and your girlfriend broke up.

03:45.159 --> 03:46.525
Yeah, it's gonna be sad...
Move it right along, man.

03:46.527 --> 03:48.393
Cool it. And the
bar crawl starts...

03:48.395 --> 03:50.495
now!
- Now!

03:50.497 --> 03:51.830
(all cheering and whooping)

03:51.832 --> 03:53.398
Actually,
where's Schmidt?

03:53.400 --> 03:55.500
Well, it's with a heavy heart...

03:55.502 --> 03:57.369
(laughs): Oh!
...that we really
must leave you.

03:57.371 --> 03:59.504
We really must.
He's too much.
It was a pleasure.

03:59.506 --> 04:00.606
Pleasure.

04:00.608 --> 04:02.007
Easy on the puns, okay?

04:02.009 --> 04:03.675
And you've got broccoli
in your teeth.

04:03.677 --> 04:05.711
Remember what I told you about
eating at public functions?

04:05.713 --> 04:07.779
Only use your back teeth.
Only use your back teeth.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.748
Hey, Fawn, I'm sorry.
We should probably get

04:09.750 --> 04:11.750
to Nick's bar
crawl now, yeah?

04:11.752 --> 04:14.786
You remember? I confirmed
it, like, ten times
with your intern.

04:14.788 --> 04:16.421
Yes, yes, yes, no.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.390
First, I need to, uh,
schmooze some vascular surgeons.

04:18.392 --> 04:20.859
Got to get a discount
on my spider vein removal. Okay?

04:20.861 --> 04:22.794
Okay, ten minutes tops.

04:22.796 --> 04:24.396
We're still going to
dinner, 'cause it took

04:24.398 --> 04:25.564
a lot to get this
reservation.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.032
Also, we can't
get wasted

04:27.034 --> 04:28.767
'cause it's a very
nice restaurant.

04:28.769 --> 04:31.303
Which means we have to pretend
to drink in front of Nick.

04:31.305 --> 04:33.372
Is that really necessary?

04:33.374 --> 04:34.606
Oh, yakkety-yakkety-yak.

04:34.608 --> 04:35.641
Don't ruin my bar crawl.

04:35.643 --> 04:36.541
Let's go. Drink.

04:36.543 --> 04:38.410
Mmm.
- Mmm.

04:38.412 --> 04:40.545
Mmm, mmm.

04:40.547 --> 04:41.947
Boom!

04:41.949 --> 04:43.915
I'm gonna outdrink
you tonight, Miller.

04:43.917 --> 04:46.485
Cece, your mouth
is writing a check

04:46.487 --> 04:48.453
that your body can't find.
(laughs)

04:48.455 --> 04:49.788
That's not an expression.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.657
Regionally specific
to Northern Illinois.

04:51.659 --> 04:53.058
We say it all the time.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.559
Thank you, Winston.
You're welcome.

04:54.561 --> 04:56.395
Don't write a check
your body can't find.

04:56.397 --> 04:57.796
(laughs)
Every day, man.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.431
For real.
- Got to. Got to.

04:59.433 --> 05:01.133
A gimlet for May.

05:01.135 --> 05:02.234
Thank you.

05:02.236 --> 05:04.002
Watch and learn, player.

05:04.004 --> 05:05.170
If you're a girl
and you're

05:05.172 --> 05:06.938
in a bar on Valentine's Day,

05:06.940 --> 05:09.174
you're basically saying,
"Hello. Good February.

05:09.176 --> 05:10.942
I'm interested in casual sex."

05:10.944 --> 05:12.210
(chuckles)
- Hmm.

05:13.446 --> 05:14.513
May, huh?

05:14.515 --> 05:16.815
That's your name?
- Yeah.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.618
Ah, that's crazy 'cause,
uh... (coughing loudly)

05:19.620 --> 05:21.787
(clears throat, groans)

05:21.789 --> 05:23.422
I know I just met you,

05:23.424 --> 05:25.490
but your name's already
written on my heart.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.426
It's fate, baby.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.761
It's fate-- seriously?
NICK: All right, come on!

05:29.763 --> 05:32.097
Five-minute warning, let's go.
Dude, I'm kind of in the
middle of something.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.865
Oh, no, nope,
you're in the middle of nothing,

05:33.867 --> 05:35.534
because that's the cheesiest
thing I've ever seen.

05:35.536 --> 05:37.269
(chuckles)
She hates you, Ernie.

05:37.271 --> 05:39.671
But I don't like her for
you, anyway. Let's go.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.373
Wait, what do you mean?

05:41.375 --> 05:43.275
I just don't know what to do.
No schools are hiring.

05:43.277 --> 05:44.710
I've contacted everyone I know.

05:44.712 --> 05:46.778
I even checked through
all my contacts in England,

05:46.780 --> 05:48.313
including my old headmaster
at Wellington Prep,

05:48.315 --> 05:50.382
to see if he knew of anything
in the States.

05:50.384 --> 05:53.885
¶ Where there's a will, there's
a Wellington way. ¶ (giggles)

05:53.887 --> 05:56.888
How do you know
the Wellington fight song?
You sing it in your sleep.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.824
Oh, God.
Look, don't worry,

05:58.826 --> 06:01.159
you're gonna find a job.
I'm just worried
about not seeing you

06:01.161 --> 06:02.994
as much if I switch schools.
Well...

06:02.996 --> 06:04.863
I'll just have to
sleep over more.

06:04.865 --> 06:08.200
Or you could move in with me.

06:10.336 --> 06:12.237
Did the music just get louder?

06:12.239 --> 06:15.407
(whoops) The crawl rolls on
and Winston's got the rear!

06:15.409 --> 06:16.508
Let's go!
CECE: Let's go.

06:16.510 --> 06:17.809
(whooping)

06:17.811 --> 06:19.511
WINSTON:
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

06:19.513 --> 06:21.546
Let's go. I got the backpack
in the back of the pack!

06:24.684 --> 06:26.685
Hey, so listen, can't
make the crawl. Bummed.

06:26.687 --> 06:28.420
What?
- But remember, tomorrow
we have that photo shoot,

06:28.422 --> 06:30.355
and I'm gonna need you
to look as Mexican

06:30.357 --> 06:31.690
as possible, okay?

06:31.692 --> 06:32.891
It's not okay.
We should be together.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.259
It's Valentine's Day.

06:34.261 --> 06:35.827
Come on, you don't really care

06:35.829 --> 06:37.396
about Valentine's Day, do you?

06:37.398 --> 06:38.597
I don't know, maybe I do.

06:38.599 --> 06:39.664
Plus, you owe me.

06:39.666 --> 06:40.832
I ran the teleprompter at your

06:40.834 --> 06:42.734
last debate--
I made "Fawn is Fine"

06:42.736 --> 06:44.336
bumper stickers on my own dime.

06:44.338 --> 06:47.372
Yeah.
- I even krumped
at that anti-gang initiative.

06:47.374 --> 06:49.608
(hip-hop song playing)

06:52.845 --> 06:54.679
Yeah, I have mixed
feelings about that.

06:54.681 --> 06:56.081
Me, too. The point is,
- Yeah.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.616
I'm tired of always
doing your things.

06:57.618 --> 06:59.918
What do you want? You want a...
you want a photo op

06:59.920 --> 07:01.420
or you want a boyfriend?

07:01.422 --> 07:03.922
Call me when you know
what you want.
Yeah, okay.

07:05.224 --> 07:06.358
¶ ¶

07:06.360 --> 07:08.727
This bar completes the eyes

07:08.729 --> 07:10.228
on my smiley face.

07:10.230 --> 07:11.430
Miller, man, it's just an honor

07:11.432 --> 07:12.764
to be on this
bar crawl with you.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.099
Just serving your vision.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.934
Are you guys
going on a bar crawl?

07:15.936 --> 07:17.636
I just got dumped,
so this holiday

07:17.638 --> 07:19.905
is really kicking me
in the penis.

07:19.907 --> 07:21.740
Me, too, man.
Me, too.

07:21.742 --> 07:22.974
It's been a real

07:22.976 --> 07:24.609
kick in the gooch.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.778
Not anymore, it's not.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.046
'Cause you're joining us.

07:28.048 --> 07:29.314
Valentine's Day

07:29.316 --> 07:30.882
might be for couples,

07:30.884 --> 07:33.118
but the crawl is for all.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.387
Yes.
- We just got our
motto, folks.

07:35.389 --> 07:38.557
ALL:
The bar crawl is for all!

07:41.928 --> 07:44.329
Good evening.
Happy Valentine's Day.

07:44.331 --> 07:45.764
May I offer you
a piece of my hear...?

07:45.766 --> 07:47.065
Hey.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.800
You again.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.902
I'm curious, d-do you actually
think that's gonna work?

07:50.904 --> 07:52.737
I mean, you tell me.

07:52.739 --> 07:54.406
(imitates heart pumping)

07:54.408 --> 07:56.107
Are you trolling bars
on Valentine's Day,

07:56.109 --> 07:58.510
trying to find sad, single
girls to hook up with you?

07:58.512 --> 08:00.946
I'm not gonna say yes,
and I'm not gonna say no,

08:00.948 --> 08:03.081
because saying no
would be a lie.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.082
So yes.

08:04.084 --> 08:05.417
I'm gonna...

08:05.419 --> 08:06.585
I'm gonna take these.
Don't!

08:06.587 --> 08:07.986
Yep.
- Paid $3.50 for those.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.821
You owe me $3.50.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.090
I don't know,
it's just such a huge step

08:12.092 --> 08:13.525
and so early in
the relationship, and I thought

08:13.527 --> 08:14.793
that I could skip the question

08:14.795 --> 08:16.328
and come back to it later,

08:16.330 --> 08:18.597
which is the strategy
I taught my S.A.T. prep course.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.131
All right, let's do
pros and cons.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.833
Okay, pros: I love him.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.603
I love his house.
I love his accent.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.771
When he says "raccoon,"
he says it like "rac-coon."

08:26.773 --> 08:28.740
Adorable.
Cons...

08:29.542 --> 08:31.643
His toaster is super-old.

08:31.645 --> 08:34.112
WOMAN: Ugh! I tried to stay out
of this, but move in with him!

08:34.114 --> 08:36.548
Yeah, well, I-I want
to move in with him, but...

08:36.550 --> 08:37.983
No "but," there's no damn "but."

08:37.985 --> 08:39.718
No "but."
- But...

08:39.720 --> 08:43.455
what if I blew it
by pretending I didn't hear him?

08:43.457 --> 08:45.156
Or maybe it wasn't that obvious.

08:45.158 --> 08:47.359
Nah, she heard me.
It was very obvious.

08:47.361 --> 08:48.894
I really hate
to see you upset.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.328
You know, if I had
something to g...

08:50.330 --> 08:51.730
You know what,
I do have something.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.498
I have a bag
of nuts in my bag.

08:53.500 --> 08:54.900
Do you want
a bag of nuts?

08:54.902 --> 08:56.668
NICK:
Maybe she didn't hear you.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.370
You know, she's got
a lot of hair.
- Mm.

08:58.372 --> 09:00.338
And hair blocks sound.

09:00.340 --> 09:03.508
It happened when we were
dating all the time.

09:03.510 --> 09:05.143
Hey, did you get
a chance to read

09:05.145 --> 09:08.213
my<i> Walking Dead</i>
fan fiction yet?

09:08.215 --> 09:09.814
What'd you think?

09:12.084 --> 09:13.885
Well, here's
the good news, lad.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.053
We have a solution.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.188
It's God's gift to man.

09:17.190 --> 09:18.890
It's alcohol.
- I can't.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.726
We agreed to pretend-drink
so we could go out to dinner.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.228
Are you saying that
'cause you want me

09:23.230 --> 09:25.263
to go to jail for murder?
- No.

09:25.265 --> 09:26.665
No, 'cause I'm gonna murder you

09:26.667 --> 09:28.700
if you're pretend-drinking
on my bar crawl!

09:28.702 --> 09:30.835
And you're breaking my heart!

09:30.837 --> 09:32.103
You can't fight

09:32.105 --> 09:33.505
the crawl.

09:33.507 --> 09:34.873
It's like fighting a hurricane.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.107
You know what a hurricane is?

09:36.109 --> 09:37.409
Do you guys have those
over the pond?

09:37.411 --> 09:38.777
We don't, but I
know what it is.

09:38.779 --> 09:39.878
You guys don't have them?
- No.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.513
They're awful.
- Mm-hmm.

09:41.515 --> 09:43.081
It's like fighting one of those.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.550
And a hurricane
doesn't have fists,

09:45.552 --> 09:47.252
so just, bang, you lose!

09:47.254 --> 09:49.054
Let's drink.
Yeah, man.

09:49.056 --> 09:50.021
Yeah!
- USA!

09:50.023 --> 09:51.289
USA!
- Yeah!
- USA!

09:51.291 --> 09:52.457
USA!
- (whoops)

09:52.459 --> 09:53.558
And also where
you're from!

09:53.560 --> 09:55.594
Mmm.
- To show respect.

09:56.862 --> 09:58.797
Well, happy V-Day to me.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.465
Fawn and I are
on the rocks.

10:00.467 --> 10:02.467
By the way, a pun that
would have killed

10:02.469 --> 10:03.802
at last week's
geologist ball.

10:03.804 --> 10:06.237
(whispering):
Let's murder her.

10:06.239 --> 10:07.405
What?!

10:07.407 --> 10:08.640
I want chicken wings.

10:08.642 --> 10:09.774
I know.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.042
How many drinks you had tonight?

10:11.044 --> 10:14.245
Nine plus three minus one.

10:14.247 --> 10:16.047
Oh, no. That's...

10:16.049 --> 10:17.816
Because I'm gonna
outdrink Miller.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.451
You are gonna outdrink Miller?
No one outdrinks Miller.

10:19.453 --> 10:21.419
I do.
I guarantee you, you don't.

10:21.421 --> 10:23.121
You don't know me.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.090
Cece, Nick just
got dumped, okay?

10:25.092 --> 10:27.659
He has a depth of
anger and sadness

10:27.661 --> 10:29.127
that rests
between his eyes,

10:29.129 --> 10:31.162
and he can drink forever
and ever and ever.

10:31.164 --> 10:32.897
You'll lose every time.

10:32.899 --> 10:34.466
Hey, it's my business partner

10:34.468 --> 10:35.934
that I was telling
you about-- Schmidt!

10:35.936 --> 10:38.737
ALL:
Schmidt!

10:38.739 --> 10:40.939
Nick, who are
all these people?
These are the crawlers.

10:40.941 --> 10:44.509
The single, the lonely,
the close-talkers,

10:44.511 --> 10:47.579
the shockingly pale,
the stank-mouths,

10:47.581 --> 10:49.414
fat boys in the back...
(whoops twice)

10:49.416 --> 10:51.616
(crawlers whoop twice)
The chubby-fronts,

10:51.618 --> 10:53.018
the delusionally-okay-
with-themselves...

10:53.020 --> 10:55.987
but no one is alone tonight
because...

10:55.989 --> 10:57.622
ALL (chanting):
The crawl is for all!

10:57.624 --> 11:00.692
The crawl is for all!
The crawl is for all!

11:00.694 --> 11:02.293
I just want chicken wings.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.195
Oh, you're hammered, Cece.

11:07.433 --> 11:10.001
Hey.
- Hey, Jess,
I'm drinking fire.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.836
That seems dangerous.
- Mm...

11:11.838 --> 11:14.939
Um, I wanted to talk to you
about what you said before.

11:14.941 --> 11:17.175
What did I say?
I can't remember.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.644
You don't... you don't
remember what you said?

11:19.646 --> 11:21.846
No, I embraced the crawl.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.382
Oh.

11:24.384 --> 11:26.151
WINSTON and NICK:
¶ When it's cold outside... ¶

11:26.153 --> 11:28.286
That sounded...
that's where we're at.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.689
¶ I've got the month of May... ¶

11:30.691 --> 11:32.624
I'm up here.
- Good, okay,
I'm down here.

11:32.626 --> 11:34.526
Okay, let's do it, y'all.
check it out.

11:34.528 --> 11:36.528
¶ I guess ¶

11:36.530 --> 11:38.496
¶ You'd say ¶

11:38.498 --> 11:42.534
¶ What can make me
feel this way? ¶

11:42.536 --> 11:43.535
Here we go!

11:43.537 --> 11:45.136
¶ Bar crawl ¶

11:45.138 --> 11:46.971
¶ Bar crawl, bar crawl ¶

11:46.973 --> 11:50.241
¶ Talkin' 'bout bar crawl ¶

11:50.243 --> 11:52.243
¶ Bar crawl... ¶
(whooping)

11:52.245 --> 11:54.212
Where my altos at?

11:54.214 --> 11:55.847
Come on, now, don't be shy!
I see you!

11:55.849 --> 11:57.882
(boos, chuckles)

11:57.884 --> 11:59.017
Oh, man.

11:59.019 --> 12:01.052
NICK: And mic drop.
Who's next?

12:01.054 --> 12:02.887
No. What?!
- No.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.489
Damn it!
Are you following me?

12:04.491 --> 12:05.890
No, I'm not
following you, dude.

12:05.892 --> 12:07.492
Do you have any nicer,
sluttier friends?

12:07.494 --> 12:10.195
Yeah, I do, and I'm never
introducing them to you.

12:10.197 --> 12:12.030
That's messed up.
And they're real dirty.

12:12.032 --> 12:14.332
Aw!
- Can I have
a gimlet, please?

12:14.334 --> 12:15.934
I.D.?
- Seriously? Why?

12:15.936 --> 12:17.402
'Cause you ordered a dumb drink.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.571
(goofy laughing)

12:19.573 --> 12:21.039
(snickering)

12:21.041 --> 12:23.274
Oh...

12:23.276 --> 12:25.009
(woman sighs)
COACH: Ah.

12:25.011 --> 12:27.112
Thank you.
You have a Kansas license.

12:27.114 --> 12:28.513
Where I learned to drive,

12:28.515 --> 12:30.081
and I have an emotional
attachment to it,

12:30.083 --> 12:31.883
and I don't need
to explain that to you.

12:31.885 --> 12:34.018
No, you don't, but...

12:34.020 --> 12:36.020
You're from Kansas?
- Yup.

12:36.022 --> 12:38.056
Well, I'm from all over.
Army brat.

12:38.058 --> 12:39.023
Me, too.

12:39.025 --> 12:40.358
You are?
- Yes.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.926
Uh, you ever lived
in North Carolina?

12:41.928 --> 12:43.461
From 1989 to 1992.

12:43.463 --> 12:44.929
Moved there in '93.
- No.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.931
You ever live in Germany?
Dusseldorf in '96!

12:46.933 --> 12:48.767
Lived there in '97!

12:48.769 --> 12:50.702
That's so weird.

12:50.704 --> 12:54.272
So, we've, like, just missed
each other for our entire lives.

12:54.274 --> 12:57.542
And then we meet, like, three
times in a row in one night.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.911
(laughs)
- Seems a little weird.

12:59.913 --> 13:02.046
It's kind of like, uh...

13:02.048 --> 13:04.616
Fate?
- No.

13:04.618 --> 13:06.751
I know! I can't believe
I said that!
- Why did you say that?

13:06.753 --> 13:07.952
That is so cheesy.
Oh, I hate that!

13:07.954 --> 13:09.487
NICK:
Hey, Coach!

13:09.489 --> 13:11.222
Coach!
I don't know them.

13:11.224 --> 13:13.424
I got a female condom
if you need it, my man!
- (whoops)

13:13.426 --> 13:15.660
Don't hold this
against me, please.

13:15.662 --> 13:17.929
CECE (groans):
Oh, God.

13:17.931 --> 13:18.930
Here, Cece,
have some water.

13:18.932 --> 13:21.299
No, thank you. No.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.935
Valentine's Day just sucks.

13:23.937 --> 13:27.071
I don't know.
I kind of like it.
- Since when?

13:27.073 --> 13:29.174
Since a few years ago.

13:29.176 --> 13:31.643
Since three years ago,
to be exact.

13:31.645 --> 13:33.678
Oh, what happened three...?

13:33.680 --> 13:35.446
Oh.

13:35.448 --> 13:37.949
It was when you first
took a chance on me.

13:37.951 --> 13:39.918
And we humped
until the sun came out.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.120
Did all the things
that R. Kelly raps about.

13:42.122 --> 13:44.022
Yeah, I know. I was there.

13:44.024 --> 13:46.157
It was the best night
of my life,

13:46.159 --> 13:47.859
and ever since then,

13:47.861 --> 13:49.627
Valentine's Day has always
been my favorite holiday,

13:49.629 --> 13:51.162
and I hope
that you don't remember

13:51.164 --> 13:54.265
that I have said
any of these things tomorrow.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.467
Oh, it's gonna
happen again.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.169
It's gonna... Oh.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.470
It's gonna happen again.

13:59.472 --> 14:00.939
All right.
- Oh...

14:00.941 --> 14:02.373
(coughing)

14:02.375 --> 14:03.975
Somehow, this isn't repulsive.

14:03.977 --> 14:06.644
It's not great, but
it certainly isn't the worst.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.613
JESS:
<i>I'm so sorry that I pretended</i>

14:08.615 --> 14:10.114
not to hear you.

14:10.116 --> 14:12.283
It's just that...
I wasn't ready for it,

14:12.285 --> 14:13.985
and sometimes you mumble
with your accent,

14:13.987 --> 14:16.120
and I never fully
understand you.

14:16.122 --> 14:18.323
I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.658
I asked you to move in with me
out of the blue.

14:20.660 --> 14:22.193
What kind of...
nutter does that?

14:22.195 --> 14:25.964
The craziest mother nutter
in the whole damn place!

14:25.966 --> 14:28.399
Ryan Geauxinue,

14:28.401 --> 14:30.735
will you move in with me?

14:30.737 --> 14:32.170
I have my own home.

14:32.172 --> 14:34.505
You live in a loft
with four guys and a urinal.

14:34.507 --> 14:35.673
Will you move in with me?

14:35.675 --> 14:38.009
Yes.

14:38.011 --> 14:39.310
Yes?
- Yes!

14:39.312 --> 14:40.645
Yes!
- Absolutely.

14:40.647 --> 14:41.646
Yes!
- Yes!

14:41.648 --> 14:42.714
(giggles)

14:42.716 --> 14:44.849
NICK:
Home base!
- (groans)

14:44.851 --> 14:47.552
Barkeep, bring us beer.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.220
If you call me "barkeep"
one more time,

14:49.222 --> 14:50.688
I'm shutting this bitch down.

14:50.690 --> 14:53.057
Mike, I love you
because you're gay...

14:53.059 --> 14:54.893
and 'cause you're dangerous.

14:54.895 --> 14:56.895
I can't believe I used
to have a crush on you.

14:56.897 --> 14:58.363
(groans)

14:58.365 --> 15:00.665
Hey, man. How's it going?

15:00.667 --> 15:01.699
I'm not hooking up tonight.

15:01.701 --> 15:02.901
I met one girl.

15:02.903 --> 15:04.335
Several times.

15:04.337 --> 15:05.703
She's pretty much perfect.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.438
Nice. Where's she at?

15:07.440 --> 15:08.706
I ditched her, dude.

15:08.708 --> 15:10.008
She's, like,
relationship material.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.509
That's not what
I'm looking for tonight.

15:11.511 --> 15:13.344
Really?
Yeah, I want something easy.

15:13.346 --> 15:14.946
Something easy?
Like Sunday morning.

15:14.948 --> 15:16.114
Like Sunday morning.
Know what I'm saying?

15:16.116 --> 15:17.515
I know what you're saying.

15:17.517 --> 15:18.883
That bitch is a Monday.

15:18.885 --> 15:20.218
Know what I'm saying?
You know what's funny?

15:20.220 --> 15:21.686
I got something
just for that.

15:21.688 --> 15:23.855
You're gonna love it.
Here it is.

15:23.857 --> 15:25.590
I can't wait.
Give it to me right...

15:25.592 --> 15:28.126
Yo!
- Go get that girl, dude.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.694
(whining): I don't even
know where she is.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.362
I didn't hit you that hard.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.131
Hey.
- (sighs)

15:33.133 --> 15:36.601
This, uh, Schmidt's
jacket you're wearing?

15:36.603 --> 15:37.936
Yeah.

15:37.938 --> 15:39.137
Not to be a nosy buddy,

15:39.139 --> 15:40.738
but sparks are flying

15:40.740 --> 15:43.207
like the Wright brothers
between you two.

15:43.209 --> 15:44.642
And I would know.

15:44.644 --> 15:47.278
I have their biography
here in my backpack.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.415
I care about Schmidt,
but just as a friend, all right?

15:50.417 --> 15:52.216
Look me in the eyes,

15:52.218 --> 15:54.352
and tell me you don't
have feelings for Schmidt.

15:58.424 --> 16:01.059
I don't have feelings for him.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.627
Dude, you are nowhere
near my eyes.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.262
Nobody hit on me.
I'm taken.
- Hey, baby.

16:04.264 --> 16:06.064
Don't talk to me.
I'm a councilwoman.

16:06.066 --> 16:07.365
Schmidt?

16:08.267 --> 16:09.500
Did the whole crawl to find you.

16:09.502 --> 16:10.902
I'm cold, I'm tired, I'm sober.

16:10.904 --> 16:13.137
I'm wearing my strapless bra
like a belt.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.572
But I know what I want.

16:15.741 --> 16:16.808
I want you.

16:16.810 --> 16:18.710
I want you to be my boyfriend.

16:19.778 --> 16:22.113
As much as I want
a commuter lane

16:22.115 --> 16:24.349
to Costa Mesa!
(crowd whooping)

16:24.351 --> 16:26.250
Vote Moscato!

16:26.252 --> 16:28.519
(crowd cheering)

16:31.690 --> 16:33.658
What?
- They're kissing.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.994
I thought maybe you were gonna
say something like, "No,"

16:35.996 --> 16:38.496
or like, "I miss him
so much now," 'cause...

16:38.498 --> 16:40.498
Last call!
Ack!

16:40.500 --> 16:42.533
We got one more bar
on the crawl!

16:42.535 --> 16:44.669
We have to finish the smile!

16:44.671 --> 16:46.037
You're never,
ever gonna make it.

16:46.039 --> 16:47.372
And I'm never
gonna ride a Jet Ski

16:47.374 --> 16:48.840
with Tom Colicchio on my back,

16:48.842 --> 16:51.109
so sometimes dreams
just don't come true.

16:51.111 --> 16:52.777
(shouting):
I'm sorry about that guy Galecky

16:52.779 --> 16:54.812
not hugging you from behind
in the water

16:54.814 --> 16:55.780
on a motorized thing!

16:55.782 --> 16:57.315
I'm sorry!

16:57.317 --> 16:59.884
We will finish
what we have started!

16:59.886 --> 17:01.319
(cheering)
Yay!

17:01.321 --> 17:03.187
We will feast on the spoils

17:03.189 --> 17:06.557
of this night
for a thousand moons!

17:06.559 --> 17:08.459
In the name of love and booze!

17:08.461 --> 17:09.827
(crawlers cheering)

17:09.829 --> 17:12.830
Oh, no. My crush is back.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.932
I hate myself.

17:16.335 --> 17:17.635
(cell phone vibrating)

17:17.637 --> 17:19.003
Oh, this person will
not stop texting me.

17:19.005 --> 17:20.671
Where is it?

17:20.673 --> 17:22.540
Sorry.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.742
Oh, it's an e-mail
from Wellington Prep.

17:24.744 --> 17:26.978
You do realize we were
just about to have sex, right?

17:26.980 --> 17:29.714
Say something to get back
in the mood. Say "raccoon."

17:29.716 --> 17:31.582
They're offering me
the job of headmaster.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.251
In England?

17:35.387 --> 17:37.455
Raccoon?

17:41.226 --> 17:43.194
So you'd be the headmaster?
Headmaster.

17:43.196 --> 17:45.329
Of Wellington?
Of Wellington.

17:45.331 --> 17:46.931
(sighs):
Headmaster.

17:46.933 --> 17:50.802
Jess... look at me.

17:51.937 --> 17:53.237
I'm not gonna take it.

17:53.239 --> 17:54.439
Wellington's
not even that great.

17:54.441 --> 17:55.673
You have
their current headmaster

17:55.675 --> 17:57.675
as your emergency contact.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.610
Okay, it's heaven on Earth.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.446
And I love it.

18:01.448 --> 18:02.914
But I love you more.

18:02.916 --> 18:04.582
Well, I love you,
which is why I can't

18:04.584 --> 18:06.484
let you pass up
this opportunity.

18:07.619 --> 18:10.755
If we were ready
to live in the same place,

18:10.757 --> 18:14.892
then we should be ready
to live 5,000 miles apart.

18:14.894 --> 18:16.928
Yeah, I suppose, but...
Well, I'll call you every night

18:16.930 --> 18:18.096
after work.
It'll only be,

18:18.098 --> 18:19.797
like, midnight your time.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.866
I could learn to stay up late.
Maybe I should try cocaine!

18:21.868 --> 18:23.801
Yeah! Or coffee!
- That, too.

18:23.803 --> 18:24.936
And I'll come and visit.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.237
It's only, like,
an 11-hour flight.

18:26.239 --> 18:27.805
And then a four-hour
drive to Wellington.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.440
That's so long!

18:29.442 --> 18:32.810
Which is great... 'cause
I can catch up on podcasts.

18:32.812 --> 18:35.113
We can do this!

18:37.382 --> 18:39.584
We can do this
long distance, right?

18:39.586 --> 18:41.619
Right.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.722
NICK (in distance):
This is our revolution!

18:44.724 --> 18:46.224
(crowd cheering outside)

18:46.226 --> 18:48.960
When I say "bar,"
you say...

18:48.962 --> 18:50.261
ALL: Crawl!
- Bar!

18:50.263 --> 18:51.762
Crawl!

18:51.764 --> 18:54.499
Jess, are you guys
coming or what?

18:56.902 --> 18:58.269
Hi.

18:58.271 --> 19:00.171
May!

19:00.173 --> 19:01.672
May!

19:01.674 --> 19:03.007
Hey.

19:03.009 --> 19:04.509
You again.
- Yeah.

19:04.511 --> 19:05.910
Me again.

19:05.912 --> 19:07.778
Look, um,
I'm sorry about earlier.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.347
I just, I-I really didn't plan

19:09.349 --> 19:11.782
on-on meeting somebody
so great tonight, you know?

19:11.784 --> 19:14.652
You messed everything up!
'Cause you're, like, awesome

19:14.654 --> 19:16.487
and that sucks because it's
like, that's not what I want.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.623
And you're pretty,
which is a bummer.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.691
'Cause it's like, damn!
She fine, but it's like,

19:20.693 --> 19:22.994
at the same time, I'm like,
I don't need this in my life.

19:22.996 --> 19:25.263
You wear a leather jacket...
I'm sorry.
I'm just confused.

19:25.265 --> 19:27.331
Are you trying to say
something nice right now?

19:27.333 --> 19:29.600
Yes. I am.

19:29.602 --> 19:31.836
And I'm terrible at it.

19:31.838 --> 19:34.105
Is there any way I could get,
I ca... I, um...

19:34.107 --> 19:36.207
I could get your number maybe?

19:39.711 --> 19:41.179
(coughing)

19:41.181 --> 19:42.613
Aw... (laughs)

19:42.615 --> 19:44.615
A long number.

19:44.617 --> 19:47.185
What the hell is this?
Is this your e-mail address?

19:47.187 --> 19:50.321
Write a good e-mail,
and I'll go out with you.

19:50.323 --> 19:53.224
What?
- I'm talking
full sentences.

19:53.226 --> 19:54.692
I'm talking no typos.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.661
No pictures. No pictures.

19:56.663 --> 19:58.729
God, you are gonna make this
really hard for me, huh?

19:58.731 --> 20:00.031
Yes.

20:00.033 --> 20:01.799
Aw...

20:02.668 --> 20:05.436
You smell good.

20:07.372 --> 20:08.573
Doug's Ale House!

20:08.575 --> 20:10.541
The tip of the smile!

20:10.543 --> 20:12.176
The crawl is complete!
(crowd cheering)

20:12.178 --> 20:13.377
Yeah!

20:13.379 --> 20:14.845
Yes!

20:14.847 --> 20:16.647
Yes! Get in!

20:16.649 --> 20:18.583
(cheering continues)

20:24.489 --> 20:26.357
Hey.
Hey.

20:26.359 --> 20:29.093
Everything okay?
I'd spent a long time
on the crawl,

20:29.095 --> 20:31.395
and now that it's over,
it's just a natural sadness.

20:31.397 --> 20:33.497
It's just gonna take a minute.
Just go on in. It's fine.

20:33.499 --> 20:36.500
What's the holdup?
Nick's cracking a little bit.

20:36.502 --> 20:37.668
Everybody, relax, okay?

20:37.670 --> 20:39.770
It's just the crawl's over.

20:39.772 --> 20:41.973
Kai is over...

20:43.408 --> 20:44.775
I got nothing to do.

20:44.777 --> 20:46.110
That's it. I'm not cracking.

20:46.112 --> 20:49.280
I just have nothing to do.

20:49.282 --> 20:52.350
Come on! Of course,
you have so much to do.

20:52.352 --> 20:53.517
Nick, we're
business partners, man.

20:53.519 --> 20:54.919
We're teammates.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.787
You're a smart
and talented guy.

20:56.789 --> 20:59.423
And tonight we found out
that you have a weird,

20:59.425 --> 21:01.259
Manson-esque charisma.

21:02.761 --> 21:04.595
You should make more maps, man.
That's what you should do.

21:04.597 --> 21:05.896
You're my idea man!

21:05.898 --> 21:07.398
Thank you, guys.
Thank you for saying

21:07.400 --> 21:09.800
all this nice stuff.
I love you guys.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.539
It's time to go inside.
We got a crawl to finish.

21:15.541 --> 21:16.574
Yeah, we got a crawl to finish.

21:16.576 --> 21:17.742
Now, out of my way!

21:17.744 --> 21:19.110
I'm getting another drink!

21:19.112 --> 21:20.845
I can't let you in.

21:21.980 --> 21:23.948
You're not wearing shoes.

21:24.750 --> 21:26.450
Where are your shoes, Nick?

21:26.452 --> 21:28.319
Honestly, I think I threw them
at a squirrel.

21:28.321 --> 21:29.553
Everybody's waiting for you.

21:29.555 --> 21:30.488
I can't go into the bar.

21:30.490 --> 21:31.789
I don't have shoes on.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.324
Why don't you have
shoes on, Nicolas?

21:33.326 --> 21:34.659
He threw them at
a squirrel again.

21:34.661 --> 21:35.993
My map is just a deformed
smile now.

21:35.995 --> 21:37.895
I didn't complete it.

21:37.897 --> 21:39.930
Or is it...

21:39.932 --> 21:41.732
a goatee face?

21:41.734 --> 21:44.001
What bar is that?
What bar is that?

21:44.003 --> 21:45.836
(chuckles)
I'm glad you asked.

21:45.838 --> 21:47.438
Welcome to Winston's bar.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.240
Happy Valentine's Day,
everybody.
