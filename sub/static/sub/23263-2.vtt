00:00.010 --> 00:01.850
Where's Sally? What's going on?

00:01.899 --> 00:04.000
I'm afraid she's gone missing.

00:04.049 --> 00:05.650
- David Cannon.
- Is he a suspect?

00:05.700 --> 00:07.269
Maybe you could help
us keep an eye on him.

00:07.320 --> 00:09.560
How would you feel about coming
to work at the Lyell for a bit?

00:09.609 --> 00:10.400
Seriously?

00:12.119 --> 00:14.470
We traced her phone to a farm in Kent.

00:14.519 --> 00:18.390
- Just want to talk, Angus!
- We need to know Sally's safe!

00:20.160 --> 00:21.949
Got a preliminary ID from his wallet.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.109
Livtar Singh.

00:23.660 --> 00:25.149
Do you think it's our fault?

00:25.199 --> 00:26.829
Probably.

00:26.879 --> 00:28.230
Regina vs Henry Drake.

00:28.280 --> 00:31.070
Drake had money. And money
bought him Morgan Lawson.

00:31.120 --> 00:32.909
No body, no case.

00:33.460 --> 00:34.310
Who was this woman?

00:34.359 --> 00:36.310
And who was she to Livtar Singh?

00:36.359 --> 00:39.070
Before Livtar drove to the
reservoir, he stopped off at a garage

00:39.119 --> 00:40.509
and made some purchases.

00:40.560 --> 00:43.229
He bought two bunches of
flowers and a teddy bear.

00:43.280 --> 00:45.630
- Any idea how long we're talking?
- 10 years. Maybe more.

00:45.679 --> 00:47.270
Look at this.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.074

01:37.039 --> 01:40.229
Morphology of the pelvic
bone suggests one adult male

01:40.280 --> 01:41.759
and one adult female.

01:42.920 --> 01:45.710
And I would say the infant
was approximately a year old.

01:45.759 --> 01:47.560
DNA will tell us the sex.

01:55.159 --> 01:57.200
- You all right?
- Hmm.

01:58.200 --> 02:02.280
Kids. Can't get used to it.

02:03.439 --> 02:05.390
No. Me neither.

02:06.040 --> 02:08.788
Got a possible ID on the necklace
recovered from the female.

02:08.840 --> 02:09.520
Good work.

02:09.568 --> 02:14.210
Greg, Suzie and Fiona Tudor.
Disappeared August 2001.

02:15.599 --> 02:17.370
When am I going to get DNA confirmation?

02:17.420 --> 02:19.650
- Close of play today.
- Ow!

02:20.199 --> 02:21.389
You all right?

02:22.939 --> 02:24.990
Plasters. In the back of my car.

02:25.039 --> 02:25.729
Thanks.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.870
What happened to the bike?

02:28.920 --> 02:32.000
Rode it to Istanbul last
year. Back down the garage.

02:35.979 --> 02:37.949
Hi, Nikki, it's Bernhardt.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.150
Hi. Is there news on Sally?

02:40.199 --> 02:42.509
No. I'm sorry. Merrick's still under.

02:42.560 --> 02:45.889
- But he does have her address.
- How did he get her home address?

02:45.939 --> 02:48.229
I don't know. I'll ask
him when he wakes up.

02:49.280 --> 02:49.829
Where are you?

02:49.879 --> 02:52.719
Crime scene. We've had a
breakthrough on a case.

04:43.120 --> 04:45.310
Thanks for coming in, Mick.

04:45.360 --> 04:47.069
Sorry it's such short notice.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.840
It's about the Tudor case --
that's all they'd tell me.

04:51.319 --> 04:54.189
Back in 2001 you led the
homicide team, correct?

04:54.240 --> 04:56.430
- Have you got him?
- Who?

04:56.480 --> 04:59.199
Greg Tudor. Have you got him?

05:05.079 --> 05:07.399
We've found his body.

05:08.839 --> 05:11.160
Buried alongside his wife and daughter.

05:12.199 --> 05:13.589
What...?

05:13.639 --> 05:16.560
Greg Tudor didn't kill Suzie and Fiona.

05:44.240 --> 05:46.319
How long were you looking for him?

05:47.920 --> 05:49.430
Ten years.

05:49.480 --> 05:54.399
Took early retirement in '03
so that I could do it properly.

05:56.519 --> 05:58.550
Cost me everything.

05:58.600 --> 06:01.629
Why were you so sure it was Greg?

06:01.680 --> 06:06.110
Violent man. Wicked temper.

06:06.160 --> 06:10.189
He was beating Suzie up
throughout their marriage.

06:10.240 --> 06:12.639
Had a suspended sentence to prove it.

06:16.959 --> 06:19.509
If I was to read this cover to cover,

06:19.560 --> 06:22.639
would I come across the name Livtar Singh?

06:26.399 --> 06:28.079
No.

06:33.279 --> 06:35.189
Right, I give up. What is it?

06:35.240 --> 06:37.800
A cornea. Human.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.199
Adhered to blood on plastic
sheeting in the boot of David's car.

06:45.759 --> 06:48.990
Could be accidental
transfer from a crime scene.

06:49.040 --> 06:51.269
I know. And it could be Sally's.

06:51.319 --> 06:52.639
Nikki.

06:56.399 --> 06:58.670
I just want to know for sure.

06:58.720 --> 07:00.870
I thought you said they
had someone in custody?

07:00.920 --> 07:02.680
They haven't charged him yet.

07:04.480 --> 07:06.870
All right, we'll run DNA.
But after that, we're done.

07:06.920 --> 07:08.509
- I am sending him packing.
- What...?

07:08.560 --> 07:10.509
We have a triple murder
on our hands, Nikki.

07:10.560 --> 07:12.550
This is a distraction we can't afford.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.269
- The fact Sally's your friend
doesn't change that. - One more day.

07:15.319 --> 07:17.829
- No. - I asked him where he
went in such a hurry yesterday.

07:17.879 --> 07:20.110
He said to meet Gwen, his lab assistant,

07:20.160 --> 07:22.399
- to ask if she had news of Sally. - So?

07:26.639 --> 07:29.790
The woman he met was young
enough to be her daughter.

07:29.839 --> 07:32.870
- Why would he lie?
- I don't know. Lovers' tiff?

07:32.920 --> 07:36.590
- He's a good-looking bloke. - She passed him a
map of the lanes near Sally's house. - Come on!

07:36.639 --> 07:38.110
I just need to know it's not him.

07:38.159 --> 07:40.350
But if there's a chance he's involved,

07:40.399 --> 07:41.959
we have to see this through.

07:44.639 --> 07:46.199
Right. One more day.

07:49.240 --> 07:50.560
Are you all right, Nikki?

07:51.759 --> 07:55.189
I mean, are you happy to
do PMs, I mean... with him?

07:55.240 --> 07:56.790
Yes. I'm fine.

07:56.840 --> 07:59.240
It's easier when we're busy.

08:02.920 --> 08:07.589
DNA matches samples on file
with Greg, Suzie and Fiona Tudor.

08:07.639 --> 08:09.560
No question it's them.

08:10.639 --> 08:13.949
All three bodies are skeletonised
but high levels of saline

08:14.000 --> 08:17.629
in the soil have led to good
preservation of the bones.

08:17.680 --> 08:19.910
Greg Tudor was wearing
polyester hiking gear

08:19.959 --> 08:22.790
so most of the material's survived intact.

08:22.839 --> 08:26.670
Evidence of a massive blow to
the top and rear of his head.

08:26.720 --> 08:31.230
Given that Greg's about...
six foot, well-built, then

08:31.279 --> 08:35.190
I think there's a fair chance that
his assailant was tall and strong.

08:35.240 --> 08:38.149
It's also possible he was sitting
down when he was attacked.

08:38.200 --> 08:40.710
- Or was taken by surprise.
- Mm-hm.

08:40.759 --> 08:45.110
Skull and likely attendant brain
injuries are of such gravity

08:45.159 --> 08:48.389
that death would have
been almost instantaneous.

08:48.440 --> 08:51.639
And we found something long and
sharp embedded in the scalp.

08:53.240 --> 08:55.230
Looks like a splinter.

08:55.279 --> 08:57.070
What we've also got --

08:57.120 --> 08:58.590
across the right hand

08:58.639 --> 09:01.429
we've got a lot of unhealed fractures,

09:01.480 --> 09:04.070
one complete finger break and also

09:04.120 --> 09:07.750
the knuckles here, they bear traces

09:07.799 --> 09:10.710
of what looks to be like rusted metal.

09:10.759 --> 09:13.029
So... shortly before he died,

09:13.080 --> 09:16.269
his hand connected to steel of some kind?

09:16.320 --> 09:19.190
- A punch, maybe?
- Who punches steel?

09:19.240 --> 09:22.039
You might have to if your
assailant was wearing this.

09:42.480 --> 09:44.389
This is it.

09:44.440 --> 09:47.669
The Tudors were staying
here when they disappeared.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.230
Has it changed much?

09:49.279 --> 09:50.470
No.

09:50.519 --> 09:52.830
So, what, they were on holiday?

09:52.879 --> 09:56.309
Greg Tudor was Surrey born-and-bred
but he settled in Glasgow.

09:56.360 --> 09:58.629
His wife Suzie's hometown?

09:58.679 --> 10:03.909
Right. Every August they'd
travel south to see his relatives.

10:03.960 --> 10:06.710
Creature of habit was our Greg.

10:06.759 --> 10:09.440
I'm going to set up a video
link for us to watch the PM.

10:13.399 --> 10:15.509
Jack? We're... We're here.

10:15.559 --> 10:17.840
OK. Tell us about the knife.

10:20.120 --> 10:25.120
You asked me why I suspected
Greg? Wasn't just his record.

10:26.600 --> 10:30.070
We found the knife in the boot
of Greg's car about five miles

10:30.120 --> 10:33.029
south of here, right behind a truck stop.

10:33.080 --> 10:34.950
Fingerprints?

10:35.000 --> 10:38.559
Just Greg's -- and the blood was Suzie's.

10:43.879 --> 10:45.110
Good, clear set.

10:45.159 --> 10:47.070
Don't look planted after-the-fact.

10:47.120 --> 10:51.710
Hmm, there's the knife. Lot
of blood on the handle, too.

10:51.759 --> 10:54.350
Nikki, any indication
Suzie Tudor was stabbed?

10:54.399 --> 10:55.470
None.

10:55.519 --> 10:58.789
And no tears or spatter on what's
left of her clothing either.

10:58.840 --> 11:01.950
I can see your logic about the truck stop.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.190
It's a perfect place to hitch a ride.

11:04.240 --> 11:05.870
Even out of the country.

11:05.919 --> 11:09.679
Thanks... but you don't have to
be kind just because I was wrong.

11:11.360 --> 11:14.950
Suzie Tudor also bears a
severe depressed fracture to the

11:15.000 --> 11:19.149
front of the skull. This injury
is also studded with wooden

11:19.200 --> 11:21.389
splinters but smaller than Greg's.

11:21.440 --> 11:23.549
Makes sense.

11:23.600 --> 11:28.710
We found traces of Suzie's blood and
hair on the leg of a coffee table.

11:28.759 --> 11:31.190
What was your theory at the time?

11:31.240 --> 11:34.230
Greg and Suzie had a row,
she ran to the bedroom,

11:34.279 --> 11:40.509
he pushed her over or she tripped
and hit her head on the leg.

11:40.559 --> 11:42.509
That makes sense.

11:42.559 --> 11:45.509
Suzie has an unhealed
fracture to her right ankle,

11:45.559 --> 11:48.590
suggesting the injury was
sustained prior to her death.

11:48.639 --> 11:50.350
What about cause of death?

11:50.399 --> 11:54.389
I would say, probably,
same as her husband.

11:54.440 --> 11:55.990
Blow to the head.

11:56.039 --> 11:57.629
What about Greg?

11:57.679 --> 12:00.070
He had a bigger head
injury so where's the blood?

12:00.120 --> 12:01.549
Not inside the house.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.549
You checked outside?

12:03.600 --> 12:06.350
- Of course we checked outside.
- Right, OK.

12:06.399 --> 12:08.990
So we've got Greg attacked first...

12:09.039 --> 12:12.190
probably outside... Suzie comes
rushing in to save her baby.

12:12.240 --> 12:14.669
Fiona's body bears no broken bones...

12:14.720 --> 12:20.110
.. or even damaged bones. Light
blue fibres are attached to

12:20.159 --> 12:22.000
a broken nail on her right hand.

12:23.759 --> 12:25.110
Have a look at this.

12:25.659 --> 12:28.600
See, this was taken the
morning that she disappeared.

12:30.080 --> 12:34.230
It's possible that the blue fibres
came from this blue blanket.

12:34.279 --> 12:37.070
When she was found, her right
hand was positioned near her mouth.

12:37.120 --> 12:38.950
Which only really leaves the question --

12:39.000 --> 12:41.389
could saliva be an effective adhesive?

12:41.440 --> 12:44.590
Maybe if it was mixed with blood.

12:44.639 --> 12:46.110
Jack?

12:46.159 --> 12:48.789
Is there a blue blanket
in the scene photos?

12:48.840 --> 12:50.389
- Mick?
- No.

12:50.440 --> 12:52.429
No, no sign of a blanket.

12:52.480 --> 12:56.429
So we can't say definitively
but given the fibres

12:56.480 --> 13:01.549
attached to the nail and the absence
of injuries... I'd say it's possible

13:01.600 --> 13:04.549
that Fiona was clawing at the blanket

13:04.600 --> 13:06.480
while she was being suffocated.

13:09.200 --> 13:11.590
Is there a next-of-kin?

13:11.639 --> 13:13.870
Anyone else we should contact?

13:13.919 --> 13:17.389
Greg and Suzie had
another daughter -- Jane.

13:17.440 --> 13:19.190
Where was she that night?

13:19.240 --> 13:21.750
Stayed behind in Glasgow
with her grandparents.

13:21.799 --> 13:23.159
What happened to her?

13:24.200 --> 13:26.909
Her grandparents made a
good fist of bringing her up

13:26.960 --> 13:28.230
but when they died...

13:28.279 --> 13:31.149
.. bounced from foster
home to foster home.

13:31.200 --> 13:35.679
By her 16th birthday, she had a
record for drugs and soliciting.

13:37.480 --> 13:38.960
See you back at the Lyell.

13:44.679 --> 13:46.470
Sally Vaughan drives a red Merc.

13:46.519 --> 13:49.279
- I want a comparison
by close of play. - Sir.

14:07.679 --> 14:09.149
Is it her?

14:09.200 --> 14:10.240
Yes, sir.

14:19.440 --> 14:23.590
Just out of interest... how did you
know that Woodlands was closed?

14:23.639 --> 14:25.269
Sorry?

14:25.320 --> 14:27.950
When you came to see us,
you knew our lab was shut.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.590
It wasn't on the news.

14:29.639 --> 14:32.149
I specifically asked the
police to keep it under wraps.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.470
We both use GDL Mortuary Products.

14:34.519 --> 14:37.159
- One of the drivers
said something. - Mm-hm.

14:38.559 --> 14:41.039
Did you come back to work
the same day I started?

14:43.000 --> 14:44.190
Yes.

14:44.240 --> 14:47.320
Jack or Clarissa spoke to the
driver -- they mentioned it to me.

15:18.519 --> 15:19.629
Hello.

15:19.679 --> 15:21.110
We've found her, Nikki.

15:21.159 --> 15:23.240
We've found Sally. I'm so sorry.

15:27.080 --> 15:28.710
Where?

15:28.759 --> 15:31.000
The hay barn on the Merrick farm.

15:47.039 --> 15:49.120
It looks like a neck break.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.480
That could be a seatbelt mark.

15:54.799 --> 15:57.990
Her car.

15:58.039 --> 16:01.080
What the hell did Merrick do with her car?

16:28.639 --> 16:30.320
Nikki. I'm really sorry.

16:31.759 --> 16:33.990
When I last saw her, she was distracted.

16:34.039 --> 16:36.279
She wanted to tell me something.

16:40.519 --> 16:43.990
I got DNA back on the
blood and the cornea.

16:44.039 --> 16:47.549
Same unknown female, not Sally.

16:47.600 --> 16:51.629
I'll put it through the
database -- might get a hit.

16:51.679 --> 16:54.759
Might even tell us what it was
doing in the back of David's car.

17:44.319 --> 17:46.319
How did you find me?

17:47.519 --> 17:48.759
Stupid question.

17:49.920 --> 17:51.269
You don't need to run, Gary.

17:51.319 --> 17:54.190
In fact, I'd advise against it.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.279
Not that criminal law's my bag.

17:57.759 --> 17:59.509
Who says I'm running?

17:59.559 --> 18:01.240
Just a hunch.

18:02.680 --> 18:05.630
I heard the police are treating
Livtar's death as murder.

18:05.680 --> 18:07.430
Did you?

18:07.480 --> 18:10.910
All I can think is --
who'd want to hurt Livtar?

18:10.960 --> 18:14.720
And did you come up with any answers?

18:15.960 --> 18:17.990
Work in progress.

18:18.039 --> 18:21.680
Are you threatening me,
Gary? Just so I'm clear.

18:23.680 --> 18:25.789
Why? You got something to hide?

18:25.839 --> 18:27.750
No more than you.

18:27.799 --> 18:31.880
But you've got more to
lose. Don't you, Anna?

19:14.799 --> 19:16.240
Is that...?

19:19.880 --> 19:22.000
I'm so sorry, Nikki.

19:24.119 --> 19:26.069
You don't have to be here, you know.

19:26.119 --> 19:27.710
Yes, I do.

19:27.759 --> 19:30.109
I need to be here and I need to stay busy

19:30.160 --> 19:32.480
and you, of all people,
should understand that.

19:33.799 --> 19:35.150
Fair enough.

19:35.200 --> 19:36.920
Does David know?

19:38.839 --> 19:40.160
Not yet.

19:41.160 --> 19:43.269
- So how did you get those?
- I asked for them.

19:43.319 --> 19:44.910
But it's not your case.

19:44.960 --> 19:46.000
Jack...

19:47.559 --> 19:49.559
.. there's something
you wanted to tell me?

19:50.640 --> 19:51.950
No, it can wait.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.640
Honestly. Go ahead.

19:56.480 --> 19:58.269
Well...

19:58.319 --> 20:01.309
.. fragments from Greg's
knuckles are decarburised steel

20:01.359 --> 20:03.829
and match samples from the welder's mask.

20:03.880 --> 20:08.359
- Right. - Decarburisation usually
occurs between 900C and 950C...

20:10.000 --> 20:11.160
David.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.200
Sally?

20:21.799 --> 20:23.869
I don't know Sally Vaughan.

20:23.920 --> 20:28.509
I think you do. We found
her address in your diary.

20:28.559 --> 20:31.750
You threatened her because she'd
"sliced and diced" your brother.

20:31.799 --> 20:33.109
Your words.

20:33.160 --> 20:36.910
I was angry... lashing out, that's all.

20:36.960 --> 20:39.869
So why's her body on your property?

20:39.920 --> 20:41.279
Someone dumped it there!

20:42.720 --> 20:46.069
So why is there paint from her
car all over your truck, which has

20:46.119 --> 20:47.480
a broken bumper?

20:49.240 --> 20:52.150
Earlier... I heard someone...

20:52.200 --> 20:54.390
You "heard someone"?

20:54.440 --> 20:56.349
I heard the dog barking...

20:56.400 --> 20:59.230
You are going to have to do a
lot better than that, Angus.

20:59.279 --> 21:01.470
Then I heard a car drive off. Fast.

21:01.519 --> 21:04.230
I thought it was your lot watching me.

21:04.279 --> 21:07.710
Angus Merrick, I'm arresting you on
suspicion of the murder of Sally Vaughan.

21:07.759 --> 21:10.109
You do not have to say anything
but it may harm your defence

21:10.160 --> 21:13.309
if you fail to mention something
you later rely upon in court.

21:13.359 --> 21:15.990
We have a name on the woman
from Livtar's memory stick.

21:16.039 --> 21:18.470
Now I knew from phone numbers

21:18.519 --> 21:22.390
and shop names in the background
the pictures were from Glasgow.

21:22.440 --> 21:25.589
Then when Jack mentioned the only
surviving member of the Tudor

21:25.640 --> 21:28.470
family had tragically
gone off the rails...

21:28.519 --> 21:29.910
Jane Tudor.

21:29.960 --> 21:32.710
Got confirmation from her arrest sheet.

21:32.759 --> 21:35.190
If Livtar was involved with
the deaths of Jane's parents

21:35.240 --> 21:37.240
and sister, why go after Jane?

21:38.680 --> 21:41.240
Same reason he left the
teddy bear and the flowers.

21:43.119 --> 21:46.279
He wanted to make amends, and
he's looking for forgiveness...

21:48.000 --> 21:49.869
.. and he can only get that from Jane.

21:49.920 --> 21:51.829
Hard to ask for it without
incriminating himself.

21:52.130 --> 21:55.589
Unless he's trying to earn it?

21:55.589 --> 21:58.440
I mean, literally, earn it?

21:59.599 --> 22:01.750
What do you mean?

22:01.799 --> 22:05.549
Remember what Emma told us about the
row between Gary Hadlow and Livtar.

22:05.599 --> 22:08.309
Hadlow said, "Asking for money
for yourself is one thing,

22:08.359 --> 22:11.029
"asking for money for
her is something else."

22:11.079 --> 22:12.829
Was "her" Jane Tudor?

22:12.880 --> 22:16.509
So Livtar's asking Hadlow for
money to compensate Jane?

22:16.559 --> 22:19.549
Maybe Hadlow's also
involved in the murders.

22:19.599 --> 22:22.549
Much easier to imagine him smashing
in Greg's skull than it is Livtar.

22:22.599 --> 22:25.470
It would explain why he risked
going back to scrub his prints...

22:25.519 --> 22:27.750
Also gives him motive to kill Livtar.

22:27.799 --> 22:30.390
Easy, easy. We haven't linked
Hadlow to the Tudor case yet,

22:30.440 --> 22:32.230
let alone anything else.

22:32.279 --> 22:35.150
The splinter from Greg's skull
is coated in linseed oil,

22:35.200 --> 22:39.160
often found on sports equipment
like cricket or baseball bats.

22:45.640 --> 22:47.880
A bat could certainly
do this kind of damage.

22:49.200 --> 22:52.750
Elm Tree Hall, the college
Livtar was attending

22:52.799 --> 22:56.099
- when the Tudors went missing. - You're
going there later, right? - Mm-hm.

22:58.920 --> 23:01.910
The recovered traces of blood
from the front of the mask --

23:01.960 --> 23:04.839
enough to score a DNA
match with Greg Tudor.

23:06.759 --> 23:09.109
So that explains why they
took it away and buried it.

23:09.160 --> 23:12.630
So Greg hits the mask
and breaks his fingers.

23:12.680 --> 23:16.190
The mask hits back with
a bat or a mallet...

23:16.240 --> 23:18.309
Cracking Greg's skull.

23:18.359 --> 23:20.670
Which would have caused
extensive blood loss --

23:20.720 --> 23:22.349
but that blood was never found.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.509
It makes sense if they were
trying to get rid of it.

23:24.559 --> 23:28.150
- But why? - Moving Greg's car and planting
the knife was a clear effort to frame him.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.470
If you leave his blood back
at the original crime scene,

23:30.519 --> 23:33.190
then that casts serious
doubt on the framing.

23:33.240 --> 23:37.430
I also found some hairs that
were caught in the strap.

23:37.480 --> 23:42.190
Root sheath material is in poor
condition but we'll try for DNA...

23:42.240 --> 23:43.759
Nikki.

23:46.400 --> 23:47.440
Sorry.

23:49.400 --> 23:51.680
- Nice work on the splinter.
- Thanks.

23:52.920 --> 23:54.950
Let's hope it leads somewhere.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.430
This is big now. A whole family dead.

23:58.480 --> 24:00.789
- Press will be all over it.
- It was big this morning.

24:00.839 --> 24:04.509
They hadn't found Sally
this morning, had they?

24:04.559 --> 24:06.000
What? I'm fine.

24:08.480 --> 24:11.109
What is it? What've you found?

24:11.160 --> 24:14.349
The blood and cornea belong
to a Melissa Lowell, 31.

24:14.400 --> 24:17.670
Her DNA's on file thanks to
a drink-driving conviction.

24:17.720 --> 24:21.109
- When did she die?
- Three weeks ago. Berry aneurysm.

24:21.160 --> 24:24.509
Suffered facial injuries when she fell
but nothing suspicious about her death.

24:24.559 --> 24:26.589
But the coroner wanted a postmortem...?

24:26.640 --> 24:29.430
Carried out by Sally
Vaughan at Woodlands lab.

24:29.480 --> 24:32.710
- Did David Cannon assist?
- Not according to the file. No.

24:32.759 --> 24:35.430
So how did Melissa Lowell's
blood end up in his car?

24:35.480 --> 24:39.400
Exactly. Does make accidental
transfer less likely...

24:40.799 --> 24:42.910
We need to view the body.

24:42.960 --> 24:44.599
Yep.

24:46.839 --> 24:50.269
Was there anything unusual about
the state of Melissa Lowell's body?

24:50.319 --> 24:52.150
Not that I'm aware of.

24:52.200 --> 24:54.589
Do you take a lot of work from Woodlands?

24:54.640 --> 24:55.950
A fair bit.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.910
So you know David Cannon?

24:57.960 --> 25:00.069
I knew Sally Vaughan better.

25:00.119 --> 25:02.430
- Right.
- Terrible thing.

25:02.480 --> 25:04.240
Yes. Terrible.

25:05.640 --> 25:08.910
What's your interest here? I'm confused.

25:08.960 --> 25:11.190
I was Sally's friend, too.

25:11.240 --> 25:13.470
I'm just trying to do my bit.

25:13.519 --> 25:16.430
Take care of some of her outstanding work.

25:16.480 --> 25:18.279
I see.

25:19.759 --> 25:21.869
Has Melissa been buried yet?

25:21.920 --> 25:23.309
I don't believe so.

25:23.359 --> 25:24.599
Can we see the body?

25:25.519 --> 25:27.960
I'd have to ask my daughter, Katie.

25:29.440 --> 25:32.910
We offer two funeral packages
here -- Standard and Traditional.

25:32.960 --> 25:36.880
Katie takes care of Standard and
we keep things pretty separate.

25:38.599 --> 25:39.880
Church and state.

25:40.920 --> 25:42.789
Can we to talk to her?

25:42.839 --> 25:45.589
She'll be in later --
I'll have her call you.

25:45.640 --> 25:47.309
Well, thanks very much.

25:47.359 --> 25:49.789
Can I use your loo, please?

25:49.839 --> 25:53.599
Well, of course. It's down
those stairs on the left.

25:55.119 --> 25:57.069
As we're taking over Sally's work,

25:57.119 --> 26:00.630
we'll need you to sign our
lab's terms and conditions.

26:00.680 --> 26:02.990
Is that really necessary?

26:03.039 --> 26:05.279
Purely a formality --
but it protects us both.

26:07.200 --> 26:08.390
Yes, yes, of course.

26:08.440 --> 26:11.519
If you've got wi-fi up here,
we could do it right now.

26:13.559 --> 26:15.319
Let me see. That's the form.

27:12.279 --> 27:13.990
There. All done.

27:14.039 --> 27:15.079
Thank you.

27:17.799 --> 27:20.589
I think we should check where
your colleague's got to.

27:20.640 --> 27:23.029
Oh, no, I'm sure she'll
be back in just a moment.

27:23.079 --> 27:24.670
No, I think we should check.

27:24.720 --> 27:26.480
Er, Mr Hawke...

27:34.240 --> 27:35.269
Thanks.

27:35.319 --> 27:36.519
We'll leave you in peace.

27:39.519 --> 27:40.910
Here's my card.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.160
Thank you.

27:48.720 --> 27:49.789
So?

27:49.839 --> 27:52.309
Her cornea's been surgically removed --

27:52.359 --> 27:54.230
wasn't the result of any fall.

27:54.279 --> 27:56.470
- Really? - Tendons in her
right leg are missing, too.

27:56.519 --> 27:57.869
You're kidding.

27:57.920 --> 28:00.230
- That wasn't in the
postmortem either? - No.

28:00.279 --> 28:02.400
It was a neat, surgical job.

28:16.319 --> 28:18.829
If a pathologist's stealing body parts,

28:18.880 --> 28:21.750
all they've got to worry about
is a watchful undertaker.

28:21.799 --> 28:23.829
But if they're colluding with them...

28:23.880 --> 28:25.829
Home and dry.

28:25.880 --> 28:29.950
Corneas are valuable and we
know that David's enterprising --

28:30.000 --> 28:31.630
he tried to buy out Sally's lab.

28:31.680 --> 28:34.109
What if Sally was on to him?

28:34.160 --> 28:36.029
But she was found on Merrick's farm.

28:36.079 --> 28:37.630
Conveniently.

28:37.680 --> 28:39.869
You think Cannon put her there?

28:39.920 --> 28:41.910
I think he'd know Merrick
threatened Sally --

28:41.960 --> 28:44.039
that he was the ideal person to frame.

28:50.279 --> 28:51.400
What?

28:54.079 --> 28:55.359
Nikki...?

28:56.400 --> 28:59.309
That's her. The woman
David met in the pub.

28:59.359 --> 29:00.990
Nikki, are you sure?

29:01.039 --> 29:02.279
Yes, I'm sure.

29:10.119 --> 29:12.440
God, it'd be good to get
hold of David's phone.

29:14.799 --> 29:17.230
Now, Gwen, I appreciate
this is hard for you

29:17.279 --> 29:19.670
but I need to ask you some
questions about Angus Merrick.

29:19.720 --> 29:21.750
And specifically...

29:21.799 --> 29:25.390
.. did Sally mention his name recently?

29:25.440 --> 29:27.589
He turned up at the lab the other day.

29:27.640 --> 29:28.750
Merrick?

29:28.799 --> 29:30.390
Sally would not call the police.

29:30.440 --> 29:32.230
And made me promise I wouldn't either.

29:32.279 --> 29:33.630
Why?

29:33.680 --> 29:36.750
Sally... always wanted to...

29:36.799 --> 29:39.430
.. understand people.

29:39.480 --> 29:42.349
She said she'd been
looking into why Angus was

29:42.400 --> 29:45.200
so against her carrying
out his brother's PM...

29:46.480 --> 29:47.509
And?

29:47.559 --> 29:51.869
He believed bodily
intrusion, cutting the flesh,

29:51.920 --> 29:54.950
violates the human spirit.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.039
Right.

29:57.200 --> 29:58.910
When did Sally talk to you about this?

29:58.960 --> 30:00.319
Recently. Month or so ago.

30:01.599 --> 30:04.349
She hinted she might contact Merrick.

30:04.400 --> 30:05.549
Well, what did you say?

30:05.599 --> 30:06.920
That it was a bad idea!

30:08.079 --> 30:09.390
Merrick threatened her life!

30:09.440 --> 30:11.640
Why would she want
anything to do with him?!

30:14.039 --> 30:16.039
- Do you think she listened?
- I don't know.

31:04.319 --> 31:06.109
Where are all the pupils?

31:06.160 --> 31:08.549
Crammers don't follow
the three term calendar.

31:08.599 --> 31:11.549
Short bursts. High
intensity. Relieved parents.

31:11.599 --> 31:13.269
That's what we're about.

31:13.319 --> 31:16.789
We're here about a pupil
who attended in August 2001.

31:16.839 --> 31:18.200
Livtar Singh?

31:19.440 --> 31:20.589
Doesn't ring a bell.

31:20.640 --> 31:21.839
What about Gary Hadlow?

31:24.000 --> 31:24.559
Sorry.

31:25.759 --> 31:26.960
Did a pupil make that?

31:29.039 --> 31:33.029
We used to offer metalwork as a
way for the kids to let off steam.

31:33.079 --> 31:34.680
Recognise that?

31:37.400 --> 31:38.990
Wherever did you find it?

31:39.039 --> 31:41.430
Tell you what. You see what
you have on Livtar Singh,

31:41.480 --> 31:43.180
we'll take a look at your workshop.

32:50.920 --> 32:52.160
Jack?

32:53.160 --> 32:54.200
Yeah?

32:59.160 --> 33:00.480
Look.

33:01.519 --> 33:02.559
Hmm.

33:09.200 --> 33:10.349
Oiled.

33:10.400 --> 33:12.279
Not splintered or broken either.

33:16.839 --> 33:18.910
There's your furnace.

33:18.960 --> 33:20.259
Maybe the bat went in there?

33:21.079 --> 33:23.779
Or it's still in the ground,
and we didn't dig deep enough.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.160
Look familiar?

33:29.720 --> 33:33.720
If you'll come inside, I'll show
you what I have on Livtar Singh.

34:01.079 --> 34:03.430
Yeah, I know, but I'd rather
have him inside the tent,

34:03.480 --> 34:04.599
if you know what I mean.

34:08.199 --> 34:11.920
After banknotes, what printed
material do we stuff in our pockets?

34:12.960 --> 34:14.150
Cannon?

34:14.199 --> 34:15.469
Receipts?

34:15.518 --> 34:18.789
Correct. So I was pretty
chuffed to decipher lettering

34:18.840 --> 34:20.599
stained on Greg Tudor's pocket.

34:21.639 --> 34:26.150
But unless it was Gaelic or something,

34:26.199 --> 34:27.639
didn't make any sense.

34:30.800 --> 34:33.150
It's a mirror. It's all back to front.

34:33.199 --> 34:34.630
Thank you.

34:34.679 --> 34:38.070
I spun it around, which gave me...

34:38.119 --> 34:39.949
Moat Wines.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.429
Local off-licence, two
miles from the house.

34:42.480 --> 34:45.070
Given the Tudors only
arrived that morning...

34:45.119 --> 34:47.619
He could've gone there the
night that he was killed?

34:49.159 --> 34:50.389
Excuse me.

34:50.440 --> 34:53.159
â™ª Where you from? You sexy thing

34:56.480 --> 34:59.119
â™ª I believe in miracles... â™ª

35:01.559 --> 35:02.550
Hello?

35:02.599 --> 35:04.150
Your new colleagues have been round.

35:04.199 --> 35:06.710
- What? - Nikki Alexander
and Thomas Chamberlain.

35:06.760 --> 35:09.150
Got Dad in a right tiss. What's going on?

35:09.199 --> 35:11.500
I don't know. I'll find
out and call you back. OK.

35:22.280 --> 35:24.230
I remember Livtar, now.

35:24.280 --> 35:26.070
Nice kid. Pushy dad.

35:26.119 --> 35:27.269
Bet you see a few of them.

35:27.320 --> 35:28.559
Oh, yes.

35:30.880 --> 35:32.119
That's Gary Hadlow.

35:33.519 --> 35:34.920
Bit of an emo thing going on.

35:36.760 --> 35:37.909
Who's the girl?

35:37.960 --> 35:39.030
Anna Lawson.

35:39.079 --> 35:40.190
Good memory.

35:40.239 --> 35:43.710
She got four As and went to
Cambridge, my biggest ever export.

35:43.760 --> 35:45.230
What about Gary?

35:45.280 --> 35:48.230
Not sure how he fared.

35:48.280 --> 35:50.309
They were an unlikely couple.

35:50.360 --> 35:51.550
In what way?

35:51.599 --> 35:55.670
She was posh, he was a
bit rough and ready...

35:55.719 --> 35:57.400
.. but very much under her spell.

35:58.320 --> 35:59.949
And how did Livtar fit in?

36:00.000 --> 36:01.360
Not sure.

36:02.320 --> 36:05.230
I was surprised when he started
hanging round with them.

36:05.280 --> 36:06.750
Did any of them stay in touch?

36:06.800 --> 36:08.909
Anna came back to speak to our pupils.

36:08.960 --> 36:11.829
Tell them how she snatched
victory from the jaws of defeat.

36:11.880 --> 36:13.070
What does she do now?

36:13.119 --> 36:15.440
Lawyer. Like her dad, but
on the corporate side.

36:16.360 --> 36:18.920
Last I heard, she was working
for a mining company.

36:20.639 --> 36:21.989
"Like her dad?"

36:22.039 --> 36:24.039
Morgan Lawson, the defence barrister.

36:25.119 --> 36:26.760
"No body, no case"?

36:28.119 --> 36:29.760
"No body, no case."

36:31.960 --> 36:34.030
I think Sally's car was rammed.

36:34.079 --> 36:35.429
Seatbelt mark on her chest,

36:35.480 --> 36:38.590
and bruise on her chin is
textbook steering wheel impact.

36:38.639 --> 36:40.349
Mm-hm, I agree.

36:40.400 --> 36:42.960
So... finding her car is a priority.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.079
Yes.

36:46.480 --> 36:49.710
David Cannon rented one
of these yesterday.

36:49.760 --> 36:51.469
Goes through a steering block.

36:51.519 --> 36:53.630
If you want to cut up a
car, this is what you'd use.

36:53.679 --> 36:56.909
David Cannon has nothing
to do with Sally's death.

36:56.960 --> 36:58.510
Have you done the postmortem?

36:58.559 --> 36:59.630
And?

36:59.679 --> 37:01.179
I'm not discussing it with you.

37:02.280 --> 37:05.269
Well, have you found any forensics
that tie Merrick to her death?

37:05.320 --> 37:07.829
What, apart from her
body being on his farm?

37:07.880 --> 37:09.079
Yes. Apart from that.

37:10.320 --> 37:13.070
We've got paint from her car on his truck.

37:13.119 --> 37:15.429
If you're going to plant a body,
why not a few paint chips?

37:15.480 --> 37:17.309
We have got Sally telling a colleague

37:17.360 --> 37:20.150
she wanted to contact and understand him.

37:20.199 --> 37:23.630
We've got Merrick with no alibi on
the night and day she disappeared.

37:23.679 --> 37:24.909
- Nor does David...
- Nikki!

37:24.960 --> 37:26.269
Merrick killed Sally.

37:26.320 --> 37:27.909
Let's find her car first.

37:27.960 --> 37:30.789
If David Cannon is up to something
else, that is a separate issue.

37:30.840 --> 37:33.349
One person couldn't lift
her onto those bales alone.

37:33.400 --> 37:35.070
In that case, the same applies to Cannon.

37:35.119 --> 37:38.070
- What if he had an accomplice?
- Nikki, I'm sorry, my advice is this --

37:38.119 --> 37:41.550
go and find a CID who you know
and trust and see if they'll bite.

37:41.599 --> 37:44.099
I cannot help you without
undermining my case...

37:44.920 --> 37:46.420
.. and neither of us want that.

38:44.880 --> 38:48.679
- Well, no-one could accuse you
of not being thorough. - Hm!

38:49.880 --> 38:53.510
Year later, and all this would
have been on hard drives somewhere.

38:53.559 --> 38:55.789
Yeah, well, that's why
you're here, Mick --

38:55.840 --> 38:57.800
to help me find the proverbial needle.

38:58.920 --> 39:02.349
Now, we think Greg went to an off-licence

39:02.400 --> 39:04.280
on the night that he died. Moat Wines?

39:05.559 --> 39:07.230
No way.

39:07.280 --> 39:09.030
What?

39:09.079 --> 39:12.269
We had a lead about a
row outside an offie.

39:12.320 --> 39:13.510
Some kids,

39:13.559 --> 39:15.550
and a bloke that could've been Greg.

39:15.599 --> 39:17.309
But you didn't get a positive ID?

39:17.360 --> 39:19.880
We tried, but resources were limited.

39:20.880 --> 39:24.519
And of course I was so
sure Greg Tudor was my man.

39:25.599 --> 39:26.949
We need to keep digging.

39:27.000 --> 39:30.389
If they buried the mask
there, why not the bat?

39:30.440 --> 39:32.139
We're still shy of a murder weapon.

39:37.480 --> 39:39.389
So we're looking for a witness statement?

39:39.440 --> 39:40.429
Mm-hm.

39:40.480 --> 39:42.269
Yeah?

39:42.320 --> 39:49.360
A man fitting Greg's description
went into Moat Wines around 8pm...

39:58.199 --> 40:01.670
After he left, the owner heard
raised voices in the street...

40:01.719 --> 40:03.349
Want me to break your jaw?

40:03.400 --> 40:07.829
He saw the man facing off
with three teenagers,

40:07.880 --> 40:10.710
two boys and a girl.

40:10.760 --> 40:11.800
Faggots.

40:12.840 --> 40:16.719
He thought one of the boys
looked Indian, or North African.

40:19.199 --> 40:20.480
Livtar.

40:21.719 --> 40:23.039
And who were the other two?

40:41.360 --> 40:43.039
I've got a handle on our suspects.

40:44.039 --> 40:45.630
Livtar and two others.

40:45.679 --> 40:47.349
One male, and one female.

40:47.400 --> 40:49.349
Gary Hadlow and Anna Lawson.

40:49.400 --> 40:50.630
You've ID'd them?

40:50.679 --> 40:52.510
Just been to the crammer where they met.

40:52.559 --> 40:53.909
Remember the note we found,

40:53.960 --> 40:55.710
Regina vs Henry Drake?

40:55.760 --> 40:56.909
Yeah?

40:56.960 --> 41:00.309
Anna's father, Morgan Lawson, got
Drake off because there was no body.

41:00.360 --> 41:03.869
A lack of bodies was also the
defining trait of the Tudor case.

41:03.920 --> 41:05.389
So what you're saying is...?

41:05.440 --> 41:08.340
Livtar wasn't the recipient of
that note, he was the sender.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.429
Can you prove that?

41:10.480 --> 41:13.440
No prints or DNA on it, except his.

41:14.480 --> 41:17.110
We think he was turning the screw,

41:17.159 --> 41:19.710
coercing Anna into paying off Jane Tudor.

41:19.760 --> 41:23.059
If we're right, it suggests Anna
was inspired by her father's mantra.

41:24.079 --> 41:25.590
"No body, no case."

41:25.639 --> 41:27.309
Moving Greg's car.

41:27.360 --> 41:29.070
Planting the knife in the boot.

41:29.119 --> 41:30.510
Livtar's volatile,

41:30.559 --> 41:31.789
Gary's a hard case.

41:31.840 --> 41:33.480
Neither had the smarts for that.

41:37.679 --> 41:39.670
Right. We bring in Gary Hadlow.

41:39.719 --> 41:41.309
If he talks, we use it to break Anna.

41:41.360 --> 41:43.030
We're going past his flat in ten minutes.

41:43.079 --> 41:46.000
Right. I'm sending an
advance party. No heroics!

41:47.760 --> 41:49.039
Yes, sir.

41:55.159 --> 41:56.429
Hi.

41:56.480 --> 41:57.719
Hi.

42:05.119 --> 42:07.269
- Oh, I've...
- Sorry. Got to split.

42:07.320 --> 42:08.519
Is everything all right?

42:09.559 --> 42:13.239
Yes. Yes. Just got to check that
I'm not going... completely mad.

42:14.559 --> 42:15.840
How do you mean?

42:24.920 --> 42:27.619
Uniform's just arrived. It
looks like he's cleared out.

42:30.760 --> 42:32.360
Oh, sure, while we're here. Come on.

43:25.719 --> 43:26.699
Nikki.

43:28.599 --> 43:29.639
David.

43:31.039 --> 43:32.159
What are you doing?

43:33.559 --> 43:35.159
Checking that I'm not going mad.

43:38.280 --> 43:39.639
Why are you following me?

43:43.199 --> 43:44.599
Why are you following me?

43:49.159 --> 43:51.920
Sally found out what you were
doing and you killed her.

43:58.000 --> 44:01.559
And what am I doing, exactly?

44:02.559 --> 44:05.269
I found a cornea covered
in blood in your car.

44:05.320 --> 44:07.510
- What? - On the plastic
sheeting in the boot

44:07.559 --> 44:09.389
- where you keep a freezer.
- That's not my car.

44:09.440 --> 44:11.429
You surgically removed
it from a Melissa Lowell.

44:11.480 --> 44:13.550
It's a pool car, it belongs to the lab.

44:13.599 --> 44:15.900
- I think you're selling
tissue. Body parts! - Oh...

44:17.800 --> 44:19.119
Oh, not again!

44:20.400 --> 44:21.469
Mm-hm.

44:21.519 --> 44:23.429
OK. Good. Well done.

44:23.480 --> 44:24.719
You got me.

44:53.159 --> 44:54.360
Bailey.

45:00.639 --> 45:02.480
Hey! HEY!

45:03.679 --> 45:04.719
Whoa!

45:11.039 --> 45:12.349
Bailey!

45:12.400 --> 45:15.710
Two days ago you got a text, and
you practically ran out of the lab.

45:15.760 --> 45:17.030
Who did you go and meet?

45:17.079 --> 45:18.269
I told you -- Gwen.

45:18.320 --> 45:19.480
Gwen?

45:20.599 --> 45:21.960
Is that true, David?

45:26.800 --> 45:28.670
No.

45:28.719 --> 45:30.920
It was someone I had a
fling with a while back.

45:31.679 --> 45:32.989
What was her name?

45:33.039 --> 45:34.510
Katie Hawke.

45:34.559 --> 45:35.630
Daughter of Brian Hawke,

45:35.679 --> 45:37.630
he's an undertaker that
we sometimes work with.

45:37.679 --> 45:38.869
I believe you've met him.

45:38.920 --> 45:40.510
Why would you lie about that?

45:40.559 --> 45:42.070
Cos it's messy.

45:42.119 --> 45:43.320
OK?

45:44.239 --> 45:45.440
It's messy.

45:46.840 --> 45:48.349
I ended it a few weeks ago,

45:48.400 --> 45:51.269
and now she's trying to use
Sally to rekindle things.

45:51.320 --> 45:52.429
How?

45:52.480 --> 45:54.989
- Not even worth going into...
- I think it is.

45:55.039 --> 45:57.510
She thinks her dad's got something
to do with Sally's murder.

45:57.559 --> 46:00.070
- It's nuts.
- Why does she think that?

46:00.119 --> 46:02.429
- You found a cornea...
- Why does she think that?

46:02.480 --> 46:05.230
Because she heard her dad having
an argument with Sally on the phone.

46:05.280 --> 46:06.590
- That's it?
- Yes, and she...

46:06.639 --> 46:08.429
.. she accessed his search history.

46:08.480 --> 46:10.679
He was looking at the
lane near Sally's house.

46:12.159 --> 46:13.510
And you don't think that's weird?

46:13.559 --> 46:15.960
Course I do, but I don't
think it makes him a killer.

46:18.519 --> 46:21.119
You lied to the police about
when you last saw Sally.

46:21.719 --> 46:24.949
You said it was at the lab, but it
was at Sally's house, wasn't it?

46:25.000 --> 46:26.670
Again, why would you lie about that?

46:26.719 --> 46:28.110
I lost my temper,

46:28.159 --> 46:29.550
and I knew how it would look.

46:29.599 --> 46:31.710
Yeah, you said you lost
your temper. And...

46:31.760 --> 46:33.150
I smashed a mug.

46:33.199 --> 46:35.070
I threw it in the sink and it broke.

46:35.119 --> 46:38.030
Yes, it was stupid, yes, it
was childish and thoughtless,

46:38.079 --> 46:40.349
but that does not make me a killer!

46:40.400 --> 46:42.699
- This is insane.
- So why not tell the police that?

46:44.960 --> 46:46.000
OK.

46:46.960 --> 46:48.000
I'll tell you.

46:49.360 --> 46:53.349
Because four years ago,
I was nearly struck off.

46:53.400 --> 46:57.630
Struck off, for falsifying
postmortem reports.

46:57.679 --> 47:00.269
And they sweated me for days.

47:00.320 --> 47:02.309
For weeks, they sweated me,

47:02.360 --> 47:03.460
and I know that look...

47:04.880 --> 47:07.599
.. when a policeman
wants you to be guilty.

47:09.400 --> 47:11.000
And I saw that look in Bernhardt.

47:28.880 --> 47:29.989
Jack.

47:30.039 --> 47:32.639
Hi, Nikki. Thomas has gone
back to the Salt Factory.

47:33.679 --> 47:35.030
Has he called you with any news?

47:35.079 --> 47:36.469
No.

47:36.519 --> 47:38.280
I told him we had to keep digging.

47:52.280 --> 47:53.440
What's that?

47:55.559 --> 47:58.079
All right, let's start
with an easy one, shall we?

47:59.679 --> 48:00.719
Is that you?

48:03.119 --> 48:04.280
Yes.

48:09.519 --> 48:11.000
Do you recognise this?

48:13.599 --> 48:14.760
No.

48:16.639 --> 48:20.039
Blood on the mask has a
DNA match to a Greg Tudor?

48:21.559 --> 48:24.550
Inside the mask, we found
a hair on the strap.

48:24.599 --> 48:27.150
That's a potential match to your friend,

48:27.199 --> 48:28.360
Gary Hadlow.

48:29.639 --> 48:34.630
You want some?! I'm right here! Come on!

48:34.679 --> 48:36.980
After your bust up with
Greg, you followed him.

48:37.920 --> 48:39.909
You wanted to get your own back.

48:39.960 --> 48:41.949
Give him a good scare.

48:42.000 --> 48:43.670
You want it, do you?!

48:43.719 --> 48:45.590
- You're mad.
- It's a joke! A joke!

48:47.079 --> 48:49.179
What you hadn't reckoned
on was his temper.

48:50.920 --> 48:52.000
Gary fought back...

48:53.440 --> 48:55.480
.. dealing Greg a fatal blow.

48:59.800 --> 49:02.230
This injury would've
caused extensive bleeding.

49:02.280 --> 49:04.780
But not a drop of Greg's
blood was found at the scene.

49:05.679 --> 49:07.349
Suzie's blood, on the other hand,

49:07.400 --> 49:08.639
was left in plain sight.

49:09.840 --> 49:13.440
And the knife, bearing Greg's
prints, was covered in her blood.

49:16.840 --> 49:18.199
But Suzie wasn't stabbed.

49:23.239 --> 49:25.190
She suffered a break to her right ankle,

49:25.239 --> 49:27.800
suggesting she broke
it just before she fell.

49:28.960 --> 49:31.059
You were the only one
who kept their nerve.

49:32.039 --> 49:34.670
It was your father's case
that suggested a way out.

49:34.719 --> 49:35.909
Put the bodies in the car.

49:35.960 --> 49:37.119
What?

49:38.079 --> 49:39.829
No bodies, no case.

49:47.840 --> 49:48.789
And one of you...

49:49.840 --> 49:51.239
.. killed the baby.

49:55.559 --> 49:57.869
When Livtar became a dad,

49:57.920 --> 49:59.519
he couldn't live with himself.

50:00.920 --> 50:03.630
When he found out what happened
to the Tudors' surviving daughter,

50:03.679 --> 50:04.880
that made it even worse.

50:09.199 --> 50:11.719
I haven't seen Livtar in years.

50:12.639 --> 50:15.429
He asked you to compensate her.

50:15.480 --> 50:18.309
All I'm hearing is baseless speculation.

50:18.360 --> 50:19.960
And that was a crazy idea, wasn't it?

50:21.079 --> 50:22.469
A suicidal idea.

50:22.519 --> 50:23.869
I'd like to leave now.

50:23.920 --> 50:25.710
So, to deal with Livtar,

50:25.760 --> 50:28.269
you utilised the shadier contacts

50:28.320 --> 50:30.150
that you've made in the mining industry.

50:30.199 --> 50:31.909
What, mercenaries on the payroll?

50:31.960 --> 50:33.309
You're 30 years out of date.

50:33.360 --> 50:35.659
Well, you've managed to
get them off the payroll.

50:36.400 --> 50:37.389
Well done.

50:41.119 --> 50:42.360
Nikki, can I have a word?

50:50.239 --> 50:51.389
Find the bat?

50:51.440 --> 50:54.190
No. A black bin liner full of earth.

50:54.239 --> 50:56.110
- Greg's blood.
- Yeah, and something else.

50:56.159 --> 50:57.469
I think you're right.

50:57.519 --> 50:58.949
I think the baby put up a fight.

50:59.000 --> 51:00.159
How do you know?

51:01.280 --> 51:02.400
Her blanket.

51:04.239 --> 51:05.909
We've run DNA. My theory?

51:05.960 --> 51:08.789
The broken fingernail came
from scratching an assailant.

51:08.840 --> 51:10.429
- Or it could be her own blood.
- It's not.

51:10.480 --> 51:12.679
The DNA's not a match
for her, or her mother.

51:13.920 --> 51:15.039
But it is female.

51:27.079 --> 51:28.679
We're going to need a DNA sample.

51:34.320 --> 51:35.920
How could you live with yourself?

51:40.039 --> 51:42.510
I want to speak to my lawyer in private...

51:42.559 --> 51:44.039
.. as is my right.

52:11.440 --> 52:12.469
It's Gwen.

52:12.519 --> 52:14.019
She's working with Katie's dad.

52:14.840 --> 52:15.880
David.

52:19.480 --> 52:21.269
The receipt for the saw rental.

52:21.320 --> 52:22.670
- It's hers.
- It was in your jacket.

52:22.719 --> 52:24.909
Course it was in my jacket,
I wanted to ask her about it.

52:24.960 --> 52:27.070
- 900 quid's a lot of money.
- Oh, bullshit. - Yeah, but...

52:27.119 --> 52:28.789
Listen. Listen! Sh-sh-sh!

52:28.840 --> 52:31.239
Just ask yourself this, OK! Sh-sh-sh!

52:33.000 --> 52:34.150
Why am I still here?

52:34.199 --> 52:35.239
Hmm?

52:36.360 --> 52:37.429
Sorry. Sorry.

52:37.480 --> 52:38.559
Sorry.

52:40.119 --> 52:41.360
Why haven't I run away? Hmm?

52:45.920 --> 52:47.280
Why haven't I run away?

52:51.199 --> 52:52.599
What's Gwen's address?

52:53.559 --> 52:54.630
Why?

52:54.679 --> 52:56.389
Her address.

52:56.440 --> 52:57.880
Write it down.

53:04.360 --> 53:07.230
- If you're...
- The only thing I'm guilty of

53:07.280 --> 53:09.349
is pressing Sally to sell the lab.

53:09.400 --> 53:14.719
And I feel more terrible about that
than you will ever, ever understand.

53:19.599 --> 53:21.989
- Are we going to sort this out? - No.

53:22.039 --> 53:23.239
You stay here.

53:24.320 --> 53:25.360
I'm sorry.

53:28.639 --> 53:30.239
If what you're saying is true...

53:31.800 --> 53:33.300
.. then I'm the one that's sorry.

53:50.000 --> 53:51.400
- Nikki.
- Jack.

53:52.960 --> 53:54.389
You asked about the pictures

53:54.440 --> 53:56.869
from the Sally Vaughan
scene on my computer.

53:56.920 --> 53:58.079
Where are you?

55:16.679 --> 55:18.389
Bumper damage.

55:18.440 --> 55:19.800
Red paint.

55:21.320 --> 55:23.039
Sally drove a red Mercedes.

55:25.480 --> 55:27.110
Why didn't you tell me?

55:27.159 --> 55:28.150
About what?

55:28.199 --> 55:29.239
About David.

55:30.920 --> 55:31.960
You didn't ask.

55:32.960 --> 55:35.360
- It wasn't my call.
- Since when has that stopped you?

55:38.079 --> 55:40.829
If Gwen and Brian are
stealing body parts regularly,

55:40.880 --> 55:42.510
they must have a regular buyer.

56:03.280 --> 56:04.719
Brian, Brian, Brian...

56:07.320 --> 56:08.760
What are you doing?

56:11.320 --> 56:12.619
This is private property.

56:13.519 --> 56:17.110
- Please put that down, Mr
Hawke! - Hey! - Brian! Brian!

56:18.280 --> 56:19.639
Call the police.

56:44.559 --> 56:45.989
Jack... Jack!

56:46.039 --> 56:47.070
Jack.

56:52.920 --> 56:54.789
You OK? You OK?

56:54.840 --> 56:56.309
Let me see. Let me see.

56:56.360 --> 56:57.670
You're OK. You're OK.

58:11.760 --> 58:15.269
Well, well, well. It's always
nice to see a familiar face.

58:15.320 --> 58:17.630
Did you ask for me to be
assigned to this case?

58:17.679 --> 58:20.840
No. I didn't, Jack. So,
don't get your hopes up.

58:22.199 --> 58:25.150
Boys, get back! Look, get
to my room. Lock the door!

58:25.199 --> 58:28.400
Local estate agent. Cleaner found
her first thing this morning.

58:29.880 --> 58:32.750
Multiple stab wounds to
the chest and abdomen.

58:32.800 --> 58:34.710
Similar in width to
Karen Sawyer's injuries.

58:34.760 --> 58:37.070
I didn't think you'd be able
to stay away after last night.

58:37.119 --> 58:39.110
You're on speaker phone,
and I'm with the police.

58:39.159 --> 58:41.309
Do you know there's been a
data breach in the hospital?

58:41.360 --> 58:43.909
He e-mailed me directly,
alerted me to the theft,

58:43.960 --> 58:45.670
and demanded Â£100,000.

58:45.719 --> 58:47.190
The perpetrator is still at large,

58:47.239 --> 58:48.869
probably armed and dangerous.

58:48.920 --> 58:51.719
So I'm vulnerable in all
sorts of ways, aren't I?
