00:26.840 --> 00:30.037
As part of Operation Homecoming
President Nixon has secured the

00:30.039 --> 00:35.037
release of all American prisoners of
war held by the North Vietnamese.

00:35.039 --> 00:38.341
All our boys are back home, no
man was left behind.

00:43.306 --> 00:47.771
Washington was rocked this week by
eyewitness reports claiming that 41

00:47.773 --> 00:51.938
American POWs are being held in the
jungles of Laos, 20 years after

00:51.940 --> 00:52.707
the Vietnam War ended.

00:54.239 --> 00:58.470
None of these reports are verified.
Stop giving these families false hope.

00:58.472 --> 01:02.438
Senate hearings today heard evidence
of signals and signs on the ground in

01:02.440 --> 01:05.971
Southeast Asia that some claim
were made by American POWs

01:05.973 --> 01:07.874
held captive since the
Vietnam War.

01:08.107 --> 01:10.937
The government dismissed the
reports amidst growing calls of a

01:10.939 --> 01:14.105
cover-up in Washington.

01:14.107 --> 01:18.372
Questions remain of the almost 2,000
American soldiers listed as missing

01:18.373 --> 01:24.974
since the Vietnam War.

01:52.906 --> 01:54.806
(guns firing)

03:23.907 --> 03:28.138
You know the story. Back in
1889, the French set up a gold

03:28.140 --> 03:34.171
mining operation on this river,
between Vietnam Laos and Cambodia.

03:34.173 --> 03:38.271
The French miners, soldiers, and
geologists sent back reports of

03:38.273 --> 03:42.738
massive gold discoveries that
made them fabulously rich.

03:42.740 --> 03:48.704
But then, they just disappeared.
55 people vanished into thin air,

03:48.706 --> 03:51.438
along with the gold.

03:51.440 --> 03:55.204
But this river is full of gold
and we're going to find it.

03:55.206 --> 03:58.270
We've been on the river for
two goddamn days.

03:58.272 --> 03:59.738
When are we going to start
panning for gold?

03:59.740 --> 04:03.137
We passed the old French mining
station a few miles back, we're doing

04:03.139 --> 04:04.270
a short detour first.

04:04.272 --> 04:06.370
- We passed it?
- Yeah.

04:06.372 --> 04:07.838
We didn't agree to no detour.

04:07.840 --> 04:09.437
We're doing this as a group,
aren't we?

04:09.439 --> 04:10.871
Yes.

04:10.873 --> 04:14.371
But as your Geology professor and the
expedition leader, sometimes I'm

04:14.373 --> 04:16.004
going to call the shots.

04:16.005 --> 04:17.370
Says who?

04:17.373 --> 04:21.937
Alright, stop messing with the drone.
You're wasting batteries.

04:21.939 --> 04:23.805
Let's get back on the river.

04:23.807 --> 04:26.171
Maybe this is what they
mean by fool's gold.

04:26.173 --> 04:29.337
Rachel, Anita, shall we head
back?.

04:29.339 --> 04:31.237
I'm going with Steve.

04:31.239 --> 04:34.304
Me too.

04:34.306 --> 04:38.137
Jez, are you taking your meds?
You're mom asked me to make sure.

04:38.139 --> 04:41.938
I'm sick of that shit, I don't
need it out here.

04:41.940 --> 04:44.107
Yeah you do.

05:01.305 --> 05:08.739
(folk music playing)

05:36.007 --> 05:38.304
It's so peaceful.

05:38.306 --> 05:41.737
Yeah, it is now.

05:41.739 --> 05:46.770
But only 50 years ago, this was
the epicenter of the Vietnam War.

05:46.772 --> 05:50.304
The whole jungle was ravaged in
fighting and bombs.

05:50.306 --> 05:53.371
Even this river was part of the North
Vietnamese army supply route called

05:53.373 --> 05:55.136
the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

05:55.138 --> 05:58.737
Same as the city.

05:58.739 --> 06:02.237
But during the war, before it fell
to the communists, Ho Chi Minh City

06:02.239 --> 06:04.771
was called Saigon.

06:04.773 --> 06:09.005
It's where my parents lived
before they escaped to the US.

06:09.007 --> 06:12.804
When we left Vietnam, we spent
many years in refugee camps.

06:12.806 --> 06:17.237
So, you're one of those ‘Boat
People'?

06:17.239 --> 06:19.103
Yeah.

06:19.105 --> 06:21.237
A lot of shit happened after the
war.

06:21.239 --> 06:23.971
And during it.

06:23.973 --> 06:28.303
You know my grandfather was a pilot,
shot down in the Vietnam War?

06:28.305 --> 06:30.204
They never found his body.

06:30.206 --> 06:32.404
Sorry, I didn't know.

06:32.406 --> 06:37.203
The war cast a dark shadow
over my family.

06:37.205 --> 06:39.270
I don't give a rat's ass
about the Vietnam War.

06:39.272 --> 06:41.071
We've come for the gold.

06:41.073 --> 06:43.071
Thanks for the sympathy.

06:43.073 --> 06:45.971
Sorry, come on,
you know I didn't mean that.

06:45.973 --> 06:50.071
You're like family

06:50.073 --> 06:53.905
Steve, you didn't say
there were rapids.

06:53.907 --> 06:55.704
Fuck!

06:55.706 --> 06:57.271
They're not marked on the map.

06:57.273 --> 07:00.170
Better break out the life vests.

07:00.172 --> 07:02.904
- Where did you put them?
- Last I saw, they were at camp.

07:02.906 --> 07:05.237
How could you just
leave them behind?

07:05.239 --> 07:08.337
You said the river was flat,
no rapids.

07:08.339 --> 07:10.173
Until your goddamn detour.

07:12.039 --> 07:13.040
Hold on!

07:14.139 --> 07:15.304
Watch Out!

07:15.306 --> 07:16.937
Come on guys,
just keep paddling.

07:16.939 --> 07:18.036
We're going to make it.

07:18.038 --> 07:18.904
Steve!

07:18.906 --> 07:19.874
Help!

07:21.473 --> 07:23.372
Come on, come on guys.

08:05.971 --> 08:10.705
Fuck yeah! That was a blast!

08:10.707 --> 08:12.407
(laughter)

08:14.740 --> 08:16.204
Is everyone ok?

08:16.206 --> 08:17.371
Yeah.

08:17.373 --> 08:20.073
Let's head over there.

08:39.206 --> 08:42.438
Is everything there?

08:42.440 --> 08:45.036
Seems to be.
That's pretty damn impressive.

08:45.038 --> 08:46.737
That's what happens
when Anita and I pack.

08:46.739 --> 08:49.070
You two dummies can't even
pack the life vests.

08:49.072 --> 08:51.040
- You all right?
- Yeah

08:51.939 --> 08:57.705
Ok, let's make a
fire and dry off.

08:57.707 --> 09:01.071
Shit! The map.

09:01.073 --> 09:03.004
So you don't know where we are?

09:03.006 --> 09:06.136
Not exactly.
But I know how to get back.

09:06.138 --> 09:08.237
The way we came from.

09:08.239 --> 09:10.304
I've got this if it helps.

09:10.306 --> 09:13.340
Yeah, when we get back to
Ho Chi Minh City.

09:14.873 --> 09:16.674
Let's go.

09:51.372 --> 09:53.273
Hey guys.

09:54.272 --> 09:55.739
The geology looks great!

09:56.439 --> 09:58.036
I'm gonna check for
gold in the river.

09:58.038 --> 09:59.270
Anyone coming?

09:59.272 --> 10:01.336
We're still drying out after
your last brilliant plan,

10:01.338 --> 10:02.470
the detour.

10:02.472 --> 10:04.239
Suit yourself.

10:08.706 --> 10:10.236
What the hell do you see
in him Rachel?

10:10.238 --> 10:12.237
He's an old fucking man.

10:12.239 --> 10:13.904
He treats me well and
he's not a kid.

10:13.906 --> 10:16.104
I heard him treating you
well last night.

10:16.106 --> 10:18.136
Pretty sure it's again the
rules for a professor to

10:18.138 --> 10:19.269
be banging one of his students.

10:19.271 --> 10:23.203
Grow up Jez. You haven't
changed since high school.

10:23.205 --> 10:26.137
High school probably wasn't even
invented when he was a kid.

10:26.139 --> 10:28.804
Are you taking your meds?

10:28.806 --> 10:34.403
Yeah, ask Anita. I took them
before the rapids, right?

10:34.405 --> 10:38.674
My watch stopped.

10:48.139 --> 10:50.771
I kinda wish I was back home.

10:50.773 --> 10:53.936
Already? We've only
been here for two days.

10:53.938 --> 10:55.771
I usually spend the
summers with my dad.

10:55.773 --> 10:57.404
We'd go fishing and stuff.

10:57.406 --> 11:00.070
I don't get to see him much
since my parents got divorced.

11:00.072 --> 11:02.404
Wait, hang on, you fish?

11:02.406 --> 11:04.969
Yeah.
Well, my dad fishes.

11:04.971 --> 11:07.770
I work on my tan.

11:07.772 --> 11:08.836
Can you hear that?

11:08.838 --> 11:11.970
What?

11:11.972 --> 11:14.704
Whispers.

11:14.706 --> 11:17.140
No. What kind of whispers?

11:18.472 --> 11:20.939
I don't know.

11:26.039 --> 11:28.204
This place gives me the creeps.
I think we should get

11:28.206 --> 11:30.870
back on the river.

11:30.872 --> 11:37.106
So do I. Something's wrong.

11:41.272 --> 11:43.438
You still can't hear that?

11:43.440 --> 11:45.173
No.

11:47.439 --> 11:56.903
[Whispers]

11:56.905 --> 11:59.736
The jungle can play tricks on your
mind, but I've been on too many

11:59.738 --> 12:01.969
camping trips back home to
be scared out here.

12:01.971 --> 12:07.273
No, this is different.

12:09.406 --> 12:14.707
Not scared? My ass!

12:54.106 --> 12:57.236
Steve, we're gonna split.

12:57.238 --> 12:58.203
Why?

12:58.205 --> 13:00.036
We just don't feel right here.

13:00.038 --> 13:01.870
Are you sure you want to go?

13:01.872 --> 13:04.403
Yeah, let's get back up river.

13:04.405 --> 13:06.304
Just so you know.

13:06.306 --> 13:08.171
I've found more gold
here in the last two hours,

13:08.173 --> 13:12.404
than I've found in Nevada
for the past two years.

13:12.406 --> 13:15.103
Bullshit.

13:15.105 --> 13:16.270
No fucking way.

13:16.272 --> 13:18.938
Look for yourself.

13:24.405 --> 13:26.305
Look how the plates roll.

13:27.206 --> 13:29.371
- Hey come on.
- What?

13:29.373 --> 13:34.337
That's it you got
some too right?

13:34.339 --> 13:37.336
I told you.

13:37.338 --> 13:39.136
Another one.

13:39.138 --> 13:42.071
Oh my god!

13:42.073 --> 13:46.673
We sure as hell hit the jackpot!

13:50.073 --> 13:53.404
We need to go get more firewood.

13:53.406 --> 13:55.071
I'll go with you.

13:55.073 --> 13:58.772
Alright.

14:11.971 --> 14:13.404
What are you doing?

14:13.406 --> 14:16.003
Hiding the gold.
You can't be too careful,

14:16.005 --> 14:18.170
even out here.

14:18.172 --> 14:23.036
Well, Anita and Jez have gone to
get some firewood.

14:23.038 --> 14:24.972
We should take advantage
of this time.

14:25.305 --> 14:26.706
Ok.

14:56.138 --> 15:00.005
[Moaning]

15:19.839 --> 15:22.970
What are you doing?

15:22.972 --> 15:24.904
Sending a message to my hunting
buddies.

15:24.906 --> 15:27.104
They'd love it out here.

15:27.106 --> 15:30.803
You won't get any signal.
We're in deep jungle.

15:30.805 --> 15:32.869
Where are we exactly?

15:32.871 --> 15:33.804
Laos.

15:33.806 --> 15:36.037
Laos?

15:36.039 --> 15:37.470
Yeah.

15:37.472 --> 15:41.104
But we'll be out tomorrow.
Vietnam's just upriver.

15:41.106 --> 15:43.870
But that's why we can't stay any
longer, we don't want to get

15:43.872 --> 15:45.736
busted for visas.

15:45.738 --> 15:47.969
Where'd you stash the gold?

15:47.971 --> 15:51.104
It's safe.

15:51.106 --> 15:56.969
Man, I gotta hand it to you.
That was some haul.

15:56.971 --> 15:58.770
To Steve, guys.

15:58.772 --> 16:00.203
To Steve.

16:00.205 --> 16:02.672
Steve.

16:06.439 --> 16:08.237
You think we'll get the
same kind of action

16:08.239 --> 16:10.803
at the old French
mining station?

16:10.805 --> 16:12.804
If the historical
accounts are true

16:12.806 --> 16:14.136
and if they found all that gold,

16:14.138 --> 16:15.903
why not?

16:15.905 --> 16:18.337
What happened to
the French miners?

16:18.339 --> 16:23.337
Maybe they were killed by gold
robbers, maybe disease.

16:23.339 --> 16:28.371
Back in 1889, this place was
wild and dangerous.

16:28.373 --> 16:30.770
There were no clues?

16:30.772 --> 16:37.003
None. No bodies were found.

16:37.005 --> 16:42.736
But what happened to the gold miners
isn't even the greatest mystery.

16:42.738 --> 16:45.037
This jungle is good at
keeping secrets.

16:45.039 --> 16:47.837
What like?

16:47.839 --> 16:51.770
Hundreds of U.S. soldiers and
airmen are still unaccounted for

16:51.772 --> 16:53.970
from the Vietnam War.

16:53.972 --> 16:58.270
Just like Anita's grandfather,
maybe thousands

16:58.272 --> 17:01.036
Many were still alive
when the war ended,

17:01.038 --> 17:03.403
left behind
by the U.S. army

17:03.405 --> 17:07.337
after they pulled
out of Vietnam.

17:07.339 --> 17:10.136
I wonder what happened
to all of them.

17:10.137 --> 17:14.002
They just disappeared.

17:14.005 --> 17:17.936
That's bullshit.
The whole POW thing's a myth.

17:17.939 --> 17:19.203
It's stupid shit,

17:19.204 --> 17:22.803
from people who can't let
go of America's glorious past.

17:22.805 --> 17:25.303
My grandfather also served.

17:25.305 --> 17:28.136
He was drafted as a teenager.
You should be more respectful.

17:28.137 --> 17:29.870
Who cares? The world's moved on.

17:29.872 --> 17:32.170
And the families of the
missing haven't.

17:32.172 --> 17:35.003
Hundreds of thousands of North
Vietnamese soldiers are still

17:35.005 --> 17:39.237
unaccounted for.
Nobody's talking about them.

17:39.239 --> 17:44.037
They're still here too.

17:44.039 --> 17:47.371
It must have been tough
fighting out here.

17:47.373 --> 17:49.870
Hunting each other like animals,

17:49.872 --> 17:51.773
trying to blow each
other's heads off.

17:52.772 --> 17:56.237
I'd hate to have been caught in one
of the Viet Cong's booby traps.

17:56.239 --> 17:59.937
Those fucking bastards were
dangerous with bamboo.

17:59.939 --> 18:04.769
My grandfather was disabled
by a mine. It blew his leg off.

18:04.771 --> 18:05.804
Shhhh...

18:05.806 --> 18:07.769
What is it?

18:07.771 --> 18:09.170
Are you ok?

18:09.172 --> 18:11.271
Someone's out there.

18:11.273 --> 18:15.173
I didn't hear anything.

18:19.006 --> 18:20.438
Hello?

18:22.173 --> 18:24.340
What the hell?

18:25.771 --> 18:26.969
Travel insurance.

18:26.971 --> 18:28.870
Where did you get that?

18:28.872 --> 18:31.236
Ho Chi Minh City.
The guy said it was from

18:31.238 --> 18:33.237
the Vietnam War.

18:33.239 --> 18:35.140
[Scraping Sound]

18:42.438 --> 18:46.838
Come on out you asshole,
I've got a gun.

18:48.404 --> 18:50.805
I aint askin' again.

19:03.337 --> 19:06.137
Steve!

19:06.139 --> 19:07.969
Don't point that gun at me.

19:07.971 --> 19:09.102
Go tie him up.

19:09.104 --> 19:11.837
What are you talking about,
he's not a prisoner.

19:11.839 --> 19:16.736
It's what he deserves, sneaking
around in the middle of the night.

19:16.738 --> 19:20.206
Put the gun down.

19:35.073 --> 19:37.873
Jez

19:41.372 --> 19:43.104
What are you afraid of?

19:43.106 --> 19:45.903
Not you that's for sure,
asshole.

19:45.905 --> 19:48.936
I'm sorry about him, but
you scared us.

19:48.938 --> 19:51.304
Please sit.

19:55.172 --> 19:58.070
What are you doing
out here so late?

19:58.072 --> 20:01.040
Do you live nearby?

20:04.206 --> 20:06.770
Do you have a name?

20:06.772 --> 20:08.137
I am the guide.

20:08.139 --> 20:12.703
The guide? What do you guide?

20:12.705 --> 20:15.369
I guide people out
of the jungle.

20:15.371 --> 20:17.970
We don't need you help man.
We know where we are.

20:17.972 --> 20:20.269
Just leave us alone.

20:20.271 --> 20:22.171
You should not be here.

20:22.173 --> 20:24.469
Where, in Laos?

20:24.471 --> 20:26.071
There are many dangers.

20:26.073 --> 20:28.936
Yeah, like tigers, elephants,
snakes, bears.

20:28.938 --> 20:31.836
We know the risks out here, man.

20:31.838 --> 20:33.402
Other dangers.

20:33.404 --> 20:35.403
Other dangers?

20:35.405 --> 20:38.970
You are all in this jungle.

20:38.972 --> 20:42.437
Surrounded by 70 million
years of history.

20:42.439 --> 20:44.973
Where a human life,

20:45.139 --> 20:48.936
can pass by in the
blink of an eye.

20:48.938 --> 20:52.137
It's pathetic. This
guy's still trying to sell us.

20:52.139 --> 20:53.837
We don't scare that easy.

20:53.839 --> 20:55.436
You must go quickly.

20:55.438 --> 20:58.104
Why? You got some drug operation
you're protecting?

20:58.106 --> 21:00.071
Some tiger poaching going on?

21:00.073 --> 21:02.103
We'll be gone tomorrow. We just
checked the river for gold,

21:02.105 --> 21:03.503
we found...

21:03.505 --> 21:06.803
He doesn't need to know what we found.
He sticks to his business,

21:06.805 --> 21:10.437
we stick to ours.

21:10.439 --> 21:12.137
Hey.

21:12.139 --> 21:14.470
You.

21:14.472 --> 21:16.936
Hey man, back the fuck off.

21:16.938 --> 21:23.235
Jez, it's ok.

21:23.237 --> 21:24.936
What are you going to do?

21:24.938 --> 21:27.903
I'm here to help you.

21:27.905 --> 21:30.836
Fucking leave her alone. Go!

21:30.838 --> 21:32.869
I'll go.

21:32.871 --> 21:34.936
But others will come for you.

21:34.938 --> 21:40.439
And they'll get some
of this too. Now git!

21:41.971 --> 21:43.970
Hey man, where the fuck
are you going?

21:43.972 --> 21:48.170
The gold that you stole from the
river, it must be put back.

21:48.172 --> 21:50.770
No fucking way!

21:50.772 --> 21:53.736
You cannot steal from it.

21:53.738 --> 21:56.236
You cannot hide from it.

21:56.238 --> 21:57.703
It is coming for you.

21:57.705 --> 21:58.570
What is?

21:58.572 --> 22:01.936
Whatever old man.
Back the fuck off!

22:01.938 --> 22:06.172
Jez put the gun down.

22:24.771 --> 22:27.437
Jesus! That was an accident.

22:27.439 --> 22:34.070
See what happens when you
point guns at people?

22:34.072 --> 22:35.836
Are you taking your meds?

22:35.838 --> 22:40.071
I didn't think I needed them.

22:40.073 --> 22:44.703
Goddamn it!

22:44.705 --> 22:46.036
What meds is he on?

22:46.038 --> 22:50.003
Bipolar disorder.
You need to take control.

22:50.005 --> 22:53.003
Ok, listen up.
It was an accident.

22:53.005 --> 22:56.335
Jez didn't mean to kill him.
We all saw that.

22:56.337 --> 23:00.036
But now we've got to deal
with what's happened.

23:00.038 --> 23:03.436
What are we gonna do?

23:03.438 --> 23:05.269
Move the body away
from the camp.

23:05.271 --> 23:08.036
Tomorrow we go downriver
to the next town,

23:08.038 --> 23:09.770
take the body with us and

23:09.772 --> 23:12.836
report the accident.

23:12.838 --> 23:14.370
Wait.

23:14.372 --> 23:17.969
Is that a good idea?
We don't know who he is.

23:17.971 --> 23:20.703
What if he is with the authorities? I
don't want to spend the rest of my

23:20.705 --> 23:23.267
life in a fucking
Laotian prison.

23:23.269 --> 23:23.969
So, what do you suggest?

23:23.971 --> 23:26.870
Leave him. He's dead already.

23:26.872 --> 23:30.235
Let's just bury him and be on our way.
Nobody needs to know.

23:30.237 --> 23:36.969
No. We've got to do the right
thing, and that's final.

23:36.971 --> 23:39.705
Give me a hand.

25:08.271 --> 25:14.969
I've never seen a dead
body before.

25:14.971 --> 25:19.239
I've never killed anyone before.

25:22.439 --> 25:28.968
We wouldn't be in this mess if
we hadn't taken you detour.

25:28.970 --> 25:31.402
That's right.

25:31.404 --> 25:35.837
Blame me for your own stupidity.

25:35.839 --> 25:38.705
Idiot.

25:49.305 --> 25:51.302
Fuck!

25:51.304 --> 25:54.470
The gold, it's gone!

25:54.472 --> 25:57.002
What do you mean?

25:57.004 --> 26:02.169
It's gone. I hid it in the tent.

26:02.171 --> 26:05.170
Or was it you.
You said you didn't want

26:05.172 --> 26:07.804
to hand it in.

26:07.806 --> 26:13.703
Hey, I'd never steal from my
closest friends.

26:13.705 --> 26:16.335
But I never trusted you.

26:16.337 --> 26:17.870
You fuckin' gook.

26:17.871 --> 26:18.737
Jez.

26:18.739 --> 26:22.935
Guys! Stop!

26:22.937 --> 26:23.969
- Steve! Steve!
- Shithead!

26:23.971 --> 26:26.236
- Get off him.
- Apologize!

26:26.238 --> 26:27.769
- Ok, I'm sorry.
- Get off him.

26:27.771 --> 26:30.803
Steve, Steve!

26:30.805 --> 26:32.302
But I didn't take the gold
you fucking dick.

26:32.304 --> 26:33.369
Who did it then?

26:33.371 --> 26:35.236
Maybe it was the guide, before
he approached us.

26:35.238 --> 26:36.968
Why would he risk his life if
he already had it?

26:36.970 --> 26:39.903
It couldn't have
just disappeared.

26:39.905 --> 26:42.868
I guess it's one less thing we
have to worry about, when we go to

26:42.870 --> 26:45.703
the cops tomorrow.

26:45.705 --> 26:51.436
We can always come
back and find more

26:51.438 --> 26:55.071
Or not.

27:44.172 --> 27:46.303
Steve you asshole.

27:46.305 --> 27:51.438
What did you say about
wasting batteries?

28:09.971 --> 28:15.706
I'm fuckin' losing it.

28:21.739 --> 28:25.203
Where've you been with that?

28:25.205 --> 28:29.737
Checking the batteries.

28:29.739 --> 28:34.836
Are you ok?

28:34.838 --> 28:41.805
Are any of us?

29:08.172 --> 29:10.135
What the fuck was that?

29:10.137 --> 29:13.003
You all heard it, right?

29:13.005 --> 29:15.136
Could be drug gangs fighting.
Lots of heroin gets trafficked

29:15.138 --> 29:16.269
through this jungle.

29:16.271 --> 29:19.202
They were heavy weapons and they
were landing close by.

29:19.204 --> 29:20.869
Whatever it was, it's over now.

29:20.871 --> 29:23.302
And earlier, my drone, it...

29:23.304 --> 29:25.935
What about it?

29:25.937 --> 29:28.069
Maybe I'm going crazy.

29:28.071 --> 29:31.835
If it was drug gangs and we're in the
middle of some kind of turf war.

29:31.837 --> 29:36.769
What if the guide
was one of them?

29:36.771 --> 29:39.135
What's gonna happen when they
find out we killed their guy?

29:39.137 --> 29:42.871
This is all my fault.

29:46.438 --> 29:49.968
The firefight might actually
help us. Maybe,

29:49.970 --> 29:54.836
they'll think the
other side did it.

29:54.838 --> 29:59.439
Will we be safe tonight?

30:01.072 --> 30:02.969
It's too dark to leave.

30:02.971 --> 30:08.905
Let's try and get some sleep.
We'll start early tomorrow.

30:35.004 --> 30:41.438
He's been there all night.

30:43.905 --> 30:46.170
OK. Let's get this done.

30:46.172 --> 30:48.169
We need to prepare the boat
for the Guide's body.

30:48.171 --> 30:49.169
Then what?

30:49.171 --> 30:52.769
Head downstream, find a village,
find the cops.

30:52.771 --> 30:55.202
What happens if they
put me in jail?

30:55.204 --> 30:57.335
They won't.
We're the only witnesses.

30:57.337 --> 30:59.469
We know what happened.

30:59.471 --> 31:02.704
Let's go.

31:26.938 --> 31:29.172
Watch your head.

31:38.171 --> 31:40.235
The boats! Where are they?

31:40.237 --> 31:41.369
They were here last night.

31:41.371 --> 31:44.070
When we got the tarp to
cover the Guide.

31:44.072 --> 31:46.938
The Guide!

31:49.870 --> 31:52.936
What the fuck?
Where's the body?!

31:52.938 --> 31:55.370
Maybe he was wounded, and he
took the boats to escape?

31:55.372 --> 31:57.203
No way. That dude was dead.

31:57.205 --> 31:59.702
We checked, and there was
a ton of blood.

31:59.704 --> 32:02.135
But there's none on the ground and
there wasn't any on the trail.

32:02.137 --> 32:04.768
This is a seriously
professional clean-up job.

32:04.770 --> 32:06.802
Maybe he was part
of a drug gang.

32:06.804 --> 32:09.836
And it also explains the gun
battle last night.

32:09.838 --> 32:11.736
Whatever. Let's get
out of here while we still

32:11.738 --> 32:14.102
- can.
- (whispering) Help, It's coming.

32:14.104 --> 32:16.836
- (whispering) Get out of here.
- Can you hear that?

32:16.838 --> 32:21.139
(whispering) You need to leave.

32:24.171 --> 32:28.235
Quit it. We're already
freaked out.

32:28.237 --> 32:30.835
They're out there.

32:30.837 --> 32:32.968
And they're coming.

32:32.970 --> 32:35.102
Who?

32:35.104 --> 32:38.972
I don't know.

32:52.770 --> 32:56.139
Shit!

32:59.837 --> 33:01.135
Oh my God.

33:01.137 --> 33:02.269
Who did this?

33:02.271 --> 33:05.035
Who? Or what!

33:05.037 --> 33:07.103
Our drug gang friends
from last night.

33:07.105 --> 33:10.038
They also left a calling card.

33:16.105 --> 33:19.938
You. Leave. Us.

33:21.372 --> 33:23.302
What do you think it means?

33:23.304 --> 33:23.968
I don't know.

33:23.970 --> 33:27.803
Who cares? They want us out!

33:27.805 --> 33:36.403
Where are our dry bags?
Our passports, all our money?

33:36.405 --> 33:39.803
We're slowly being robbed of
everything.

33:39.805 --> 33:44.868
It's like the jungle is
bleeding us dry.

33:44.870 --> 33:46.702
Rachel.

33:46.704 --> 33:50.869
I'm sure it's gonna
to be alright.

33:50.871 --> 33:52.272
Jez.

33:58.004 --> 34:00.003
Have you still got your gun?

34:00.005 --> 34:01.468
Fuck.

34:01.470 --> 34:08.469
It was in the dry bag.
My meds too.

34:08.471 --> 34:11.105
Fuck.

34:17.705 --> 34:27.339
“Why did you leave us”?

34:33.172 --> 34:35.803
We'll stay put tonight.
We have a camp.

34:35.804 --> 34:39.435
We're near the river and it'll
be dark in a few hours.

34:39.437 --> 34:41.202
Will it be safe?

34:41.204 --> 34:42.103
I hope so.

34:42.105 --> 34:46.202
You hope so? Is that
the best you got?

34:46.204 --> 34:49.835
We'll head out early tomorrow,
moving east towards Vietnam.

34:49.838 --> 34:51.935
How long will it
take to walk out?

34:51.937 --> 34:54.802
There's a logging road about
30 miles from here.

34:54.804 --> 34:56.436
But we're almost out of food.

34:56.438 --> 35:00.702
No map and we'll be mostly
traveling through dense jungle.

35:00.704 --> 35:01.735
But I have a plan.

35:01.737 --> 35:03.902
What? Another detour?

35:03.904 --> 35:06.935
We'll take turns as
lookouts on this river.

35:06.937 --> 35:09.401
Try to attract passing
boats this afternoon.

35:09.403 --> 35:12.336
It'll save us a long
jungle trek tomorrow.

35:12.337 --> 35:14.903
OK.

35:14.905 --> 35:17.302
Any questions?

35:17.304 --> 35:19.404
Good.

35:31.272 --> 35:34.468
What time is it?
I left my watch in the dry bag.

35:34.470 --> 35:38.203
I don't know. It's
still drying out.

35:38.205 --> 35:40.769
How you holding up?

35:40.771 --> 35:43.303
I think I'm going nuts.

35:43.305 --> 35:45.270
Remember last night,

35:45.272 --> 35:49.968
my drone started flying
around with no batteries.

35:49.970 --> 35:52.102
That's impossible.

35:52.104 --> 35:54.102
I know, right?

35:54.104 --> 35:57.370
Nothing seems to make
sense anymore.

35:58.870 --> 36:01.203
Everything changed when I
shot the Guide.

36:01.205 --> 36:02.935
I never should have
never bought that gun.

36:02.937 --> 36:04.768
Listen... Listen.

36:04.770 --> 36:07.803
It was an accident, ok?

36:07.805 --> 36:15.338
What's important now is
that we're all safe.

36:20.838 --> 36:23.236
Not one boat all afternoon?

36:23.238 --> 36:25.071
Nope.

36:27.805 --> 36:30.902
I guess that settles it.

36:30.904 --> 36:34.334
Tomorrow we have to trek out.

36:34.336 --> 36:36.203
Why can't we go now?

36:36.205 --> 36:39.236
It's too dark.

36:39.238 --> 36:41.704
Now is the worst time
to be there.

36:43.438 --> 36:51.135
At night this place turns from a
jungle paradise to a primeval hell.

36:51.137 --> 36:58.401
Full of fear of the dark,
of the unknown.

36:58.403 --> 37:00.935
Of whatever's out
there in the night.

37:00.937 --> 37:06.302
Cut it out Anita, you're
freaking me out.

37:06.304 --> 37:11.335
Out here, I don't
even have to try.

37:11.337 --> 37:14.736
Where you going?

37:14.738 --> 37:16.234
Call of nature.

37:16.236 --> 37:18.768
Alright. Stay close, OK?

37:18.770 --> 37:21.838
OK.

37:31.104 --> 37:33.835
Hey.

37:33.837 --> 37:36.202
Do you think Anita's
acting strange?

37:36.204 --> 37:38.736
Strange, how?

37:38.738 --> 37:43.234
She just seems a bit off.

37:43.236 --> 37:46.201
You don't think she
took the gold?

37:46.203 --> 37:48.737
No. No way.

37:53.037 --> 37:54.836
What are you guys talking about?

37:54.838 --> 38:00.270
Nothing.

39:07.805 --> 39:09.201
What are you doing here?

39:09.203 --> 39:11.235
Are you CIA?

39:11.237 --> 39:12.736
I'm on holiday.

39:12.738 --> 39:14.070
Yeah, holiday my ass.

39:14.072 --> 39:16.268
Who holiday's out here in a
fucking war zone?

39:16.270 --> 39:19.736
What war?

39:19.738 --> 39:20.835
What the hell is this?

39:20.837 --> 39:23.703
It's a cell phone.

39:23.705 --> 39:26.202
Turn that fucking thing off.

39:26.204 --> 39:28.738
They're gonna see us.

39:31.404 --> 39:32.935
Are you the rescue mission?

39:32.937 --> 39:34.902
No. What rescue mission?

39:34.904 --> 39:37.334
Then who the fuck are you?
And what are you doing out here?

39:37.336 --> 39:39.468
I'm American.
I'm from Wisconsin.

39:39.470 --> 39:40.835
Yeah? And how
about your friends?

39:40.837 --> 39:43.902
And don't give me any of that
bullshit that you guys are on some

39:43.904 --> 39:45.301
sort of vacation.

39:45.303 --> 39:47.301
We came here on the river
looking for gold.

39:47.303 --> 39:51.469
That's it, I swear.

39:51.471 --> 39:54.036
I thought you guys
came to get us out.

39:54.038 --> 39:55.769
There's more of you?

39:55.771 --> 39:58.201
We're scattered all
over the jungle.

39:58.203 --> 40:00.469
How long have you been here?

40:00.471 --> 40:02.836
A long time

40:02.838 --> 40:07.302
Evading the Viet Cong, the
North Vietnamese Army.

40:07.304 --> 40:09.002
And others.

40:09.004 --> 40:12.902
But we're all trapped here now,
and there's no way out!

40:12.904 --> 40:14.301
Who are you?

40:14.303 --> 40:16.435
I'm a pilot.
I managed to escape.

40:16.437 --> 40:19.868
But ever since then I've been
waiting for a rescue mission.

40:19.870 --> 40:23.868
I really need it and you're
obviously not it.

40:23.870 --> 40:26.202
Are you saying that you fought
in the Vietnam War?

40:26.204 --> 40:30.201
I'm still fighting in the Vietnam
War and so are all the others.

40:30.203 --> 40:33.202
Look, it's not safe for you
and your friends here.

40:33.204 --> 40:34.835
You need to leave.
Now.

40:34.837 --> 40:38.335
What year is it?

40:38.337 --> 40:42.401
It's 1970.

40:42.403 --> 40:44.903
You don't know that?

40:44.905 --> 40:46.401
Tell me something

40:46.403 --> 40:49.369
who's the president of
the United States?

40:49.371 --> 40:52.134
Donald Trump.

40:52.136 --> 40:54.368
Who the fuck is he?
It's Richard Nixon!

40:54.370 --> 40:57.002
Kissinger!
The Secretary of State is Henry

40:57.004 --> 40:59.334
Kissinger.
Right?

40:59.336 --> 41:01.268
Ok...

41:01.270 --> 41:03.735
I've been here too long. I'm
starting to see shit or you're

41:03.737 --> 41:05.302
some sort of a fucking
ghost or something.

41:05.304 --> 41:08.703
I am not a ghost.
I'm real, but...

41:08.705 --> 41:10.069
How did you get here?

41:10.071 --> 41:12.201
We were POWs.

41:12.203 --> 41:14.469
We escaped. But that doesn't
matter, because we've

41:14.471 --> 41:17.202
been waiting for a rescue
mission every single night, and

41:17.204 --> 41:21.169
nothing's showed up.

41:21.171 --> 41:24.169
Nobody's coming for you.

41:24.171 --> 41:27.135
What the fuck are you talking
about?

41:27.137 --> 41:30.134
People back home think that POWs
weren't left behind.

41:30.136 --> 41:32.368
They think it's a myth.

41:32.370 --> 41:36.302
Well, let me ask you somethin'g.
Do I look like a goddamn myth?

41:36.304 --> 41:41.268
They said that all POWs were sent home
before the U.S. withdrew from Vietnam.

41:41.270 --> 41:47.001
Withdrew? What the fuck
are you talking about?

41:47.003 --> 41:51.702
The Vietnam War ended
decades ago.

41:51.704 --> 41:55.967
You're full of shit.

41:55.969 --> 42:03.235
Hey! Hey! Hey!

42:03.237 --> 42:09.735
Hey! Down here! Down here! Hey!

42:09.737 --> 42:12.968
Fucking assholes!
I see them every night.

42:12.970 --> 42:14.735
It's an SAR flight.

42:14.737 --> 42:16.101
What is that?

42:16.103 --> 42:19.102
Search and rescue.
They're looking for us, but they

42:19.104 --> 42:22.334
never fucking see me.

42:22.336 --> 42:26.703
That's because it's a commercial
airliner and they have no idea

42:26.705 --> 42:28.803
that you're here.

42:28.805 --> 42:31.401
A commercial airliner?
Are you fucking stupid?

42:31.403 --> 42:35.836
The gooks have anti-aircraft
missiles all over this jungle.

42:35.838 --> 42:38.269
It's the 21st century.

42:38.271 --> 42:41.101
That would make me a real old
man then wouldn't it honey?

42:41.103 --> 42:44.202
Let me ask you something, do I
look like an old man?

42:44.204 --> 42:46.468
No, but you should.

42:46.470 --> 42:50.201
Look, I'm only 22 goddamn it. I
need to get back home to my wife.

42:50.203 --> 42:55.102
She's pregnant and I need to
get back to her.

42:55.104 --> 43:02.702
We go married before
I shipped out.

43:02.704 --> 43:05.402
She was my high
school sweetheart.

43:05.404 --> 43:07.235
That's your wife?

43:07.237 --> 43:10.268
Yeah.

43:10.270 --> 43:12.868
Martha?

43:12.870 --> 43:17.201
How the hell do you
know my wife?

43:17.203 --> 43:20.803
She's my grandmother.

43:20.805 --> 43:24.835
We have the same photo on
our mantle at home.

43:24.837 --> 43:27.169
Oh my god.

43:27.171 --> 43:32.201
You're my grandfather,
Kenneth Bosco?

43:32.203 --> 43:39.802
MIA since February 1968? Shot
downover South Vietnam?

43:39.804 --> 43:43.302
I was shot down in Laos.
That was supposed to be a

43:43.304 --> 43:46.803
top secret mission.

43:46.805 --> 43:49.102
You said you're my...

43:49.104 --> 43:53.834
I'm your grand daughter.

43:53.836 --> 43:59.002
Anita.

43:59.004 --> 44:08.103
Your daughter Caroline, she was
born in 1968. She's my mom.

44:10.103 --> 44:13.134
What about Martha?

44:13.136 --> 44:17.069
She passed last year.

44:17.071 --> 44:20.772
She never gave up on you.

44:33.203 --> 44:42.069
She always would pray that
you'd come back.

44:42.071 --> 44:45.202
But you're never going home.

44:45.204 --> 44:47.202
Why?

44:47.204 --> 44:51.035
Because you're already dead.

44:51.037 --> 44:55.002
Your country forgot about you,
but your family never did.

44:55.004 --> 44:57.001
Shit.

44:57.003 --> 44:59.101
I don't know how
you know all this.

44:59.103 --> 45:02.169
But they wouldn't just leave me
to die all alone in the jungle.

45:02.171 --> 45:04.703
They wouldn't leave us.

45:04.705 --> 45:06.034
No man left behind right?

45:06.036 --> 45:09.902
Yes they would.

45:09.904 --> 45:12.902
And they did.

45:12.904 --> 45:15.705
I'm sorry.

45:18.470 --> 45:21.269
So they really left us.

45:21.271 --> 45:24.934
No one is coming for
us except...

45:24.936 --> 45:26.369
Except what?

45:26.371 --> 45:28.034
I was worried.

45:28.036 --> 45:30.768
I woke and you'd gone.

45:30.770 --> 45:32.035
Did you see him?

45:32.037 --> 45:32.669
Who?

45:32.671 --> 45:34.301
The guy I was talking to.

45:34.303 --> 45:36.702
Huh? There was no one.

45:36.704 --> 45:38.767
Come on, let's go,
let's go back.

45:38.769 --> 45:40.402
But.

45:40.404 --> 45:43.001
He was saying...

45:43.003 --> 45:45.234
The jungle can play serious
tricks on your mind.

45:45.236 --> 45:48.438
Come on, let's go.

45:50.770 --> 45:53.004
Anita

46:06.769 --> 46:08.237
Anita.

46:10.470 --> 46:13.237
Follow me.

46:25.037 --> 46:27.102
I came to tell you
that I'm going.

46:27.104 --> 46:29.934
Where?

46:29.936 --> 46:32.902
You made me realize,
nobody's coming for me.

46:32.904 --> 46:34.435
For us.

46:34.437 --> 46:36.301
It's time I joined Martha.

46:36.303 --> 46:38.134
I'm sorry it had to
be like this.

46:38.136 --> 46:39.734
Don't be.

46:39.736 --> 46:43.401
Because of you, I don't have to spend
the rest of my days being hunted and

46:43.403 --> 46:46.135
tracked in the jungle.

46:46.137 --> 46:47.934
Like the rest of ‘em.

46:47.936 --> 46:49.335
How many more are there?

46:49.337 --> 46:50.701
Too many.

46:50.703 --> 46:52.068
But look, that's not important.

46:52.070 --> 46:55.835
Anita, something really bad is
coming for you and your friends.

46:55.837 --> 46:57.369
What?

46:57.371 --> 46:59.436
The Greater Evil.
It's too powerful and I

46:59.438 --> 47:01.234
can't protect you.

47:01.236 --> 47:05.134
You have to get out of here as
soon as possible.

47:05.136 --> 47:09.002
It's time. I gotta go.
Take care.

47:09.004 --> 47:12.004
Wait. Wait!

47:29.936 --> 47:33.235
OK guys, this is
gonna to be tough.

47:33.237 --> 47:36.335
We're traveling through deep jungle.
It's full of unexploded ordnance

47:36.337 --> 47:37.835
from the Vietnam War.

47:37.837 --> 47:40.103
So we gotta be careful, OK?

47:42.903 --> 47:45.670
Let's go.

48:34.769 --> 48:37.204
Mind your head guys.

49:25.836 --> 49:29.870
Let's take a break.

49:41.071 --> 49:45.168
How much further?

49:45.170 --> 49:48.368
Can't be too far.

49:48.370 --> 49:51.170
Just keep moving.

50:21.836 --> 50:24.234
Hey.

50:24.236 --> 50:26.102
What is it?

50:26.104 --> 50:29.405
On second thought,
don't even tell me.

50:48.903 --> 50:54.767
Guys, look. I've found a trail.

50:54.769 --> 50:58.970
This'll make our
lives much easier.

51:01.437 --> 51:05.971
Hey, look at that.

51:10.170 --> 51:12.168
Seems fresh.

51:12.170 --> 51:15.934
Maybe there are others lost
out here, also looking for help.

51:15.936 --> 51:18.967
We'll follow the trail. It's
heading in the right direction,

51:18.969 --> 51:23.370
back to Vietnam.

51:25.370 --> 51:27.135
What's that?

51:27.137 --> 51:28.335
You hear it too?

51:28.337 --> 51:30.935
So can I. Sounds like
wind chimes.

51:30.937 --> 51:33.269
Just keep moving, they
clearly want us gone.

51:33.271 --> 51:34.835
Wait.

51:34.837 --> 51:38.001
Anita!

51:38.003 --> 51:41.203
Hey guys! Come here!

51:56.469 --> 51:59.801
What are you guys doing?
Don't go in there.

51:59.803 --> 52:01.368
You're just gonna
waste more time.

52:01.370 --> 52:05.235
Someone might live here,
could help get us out.

52:05.237 --> 52:07.135
Let's just keep moving.

52:07.137 --> 52:09.102
Are you OK?

52:09.104 --> 52:11.169
I'm freaking out
without my meds.

52:11.171 --> 52:13.268
We're gonna make it
OK? Trust me.

52:13.270 --> 52:15.836
Let's just check out
this place first.

52:20.837 --> 52:22.971
What is it?

52:24.804 --> 52:26.702
Nothing.

52:26.704 --> 52:29.035
Let's go.

52:29.037 --> 52:31.936
What the fuck?

52:38.737 --> 52:42.004
Hello? Is anyone here?

52:54.703 --> 52:56.169
Rachel!

52:56.171 --> 52:57.767
Are you OK?

52:57.769 --> 52:58.434
What's wrong?

52:58.436 --> 53:00.201
I think I sprained my ankle.

53:00.203 --> 53:02.069
Are you OK?

53:02.071 --> 53:06.038
This is beyond scary. Let's go.

53:10.270 --> 53:13.367
Oh my god.

53:13.369 --> 53:15.367
Guys.

53:15.369 --> 53:17.702
This is my grandfather.

53:17.704 --> 53:19.968
He came to me last night and he
showed me this photo.

53:19.970 --> 53:22.102
What are you talking about?
Let's fucking leave.

53:22.104 --> 53:24.801
Look, this is my
grandmother Martha.

53:24.803 --> 53:26.002
We have the same photo at home.

53:26.004 --> 53:29.400
It looks like her, but you said
he visited you last night?

53:29.402 --> 53:30.401
Yes he did.

53:30.403 --> 53:32.902
Look.

53:32.904 --> 53:34.935
Dog tags.

53:34.937 --> 53:36.233
What are the odds?

53:36.235 --> 53:37.401
We have to bury him.

53:37.403 --> 53:40.038
No way, let's get out of here.

53:41.937 --> 53:45.237
What the hell?

53:56.804 --> 54:02.901
It must have been a prison cave,
for American POWs.

54:02.903 --> 54:06.101
Poor souls.

54:06.103 --> 54:08.201
Now we're in the same situation.

54:08.203 --> 54:11.735
No one knows where we are, no
one's gonna come and find us.

54:11.737 --> 54:15.834
And if we die out here no one's
gonna know what happened to us.

54:15.836 --> 54:19.268
That ain't happening to me,
I'm leaving.

54:19.270 --> 54:21.001
Jez, please stay.

54:21.003 --> 54:22.401
I gotta get the hell
out of here.

54:22.403 --> 54:24.101
I wish you wouldn't.

54:24.103 --> 54:28.835
I'll stay on the trail.
I might find help.

54:28.837 --> 54:31.267
I've got to bury him.

54:31.269 --> 54:35.034
I'll be fine. I,
I just gotta go.

54:35.036 --> 54:40.233
OK. Be careful.

54:40.235 --> 54:42.436
We'll be right behind you.

54:44.704 --> 54:46.401
Be careful.

54:46.403 --> 54:49.302
Watch out for the drug gang.

55:12.703 --> 55:16.901
It's hardly Arlington.

55:16.903 --> 55:19.835
At least it's a burial.

55:19.837 --> 55:24.334
Most didn't even get that.

55:24.336 --> 55:27.802
Any last words?

55:27.804 --> 55:29.167
Can I have a minute?

55:29.169 --> 55:32.770
Sure.

56:21.770 --> 56:23.233
I don't want to slow us down.

56:23.235 --> 56:25.901
Don't worry.
I'll carry you the whole

56:25.903 --> 56:28.703
way if I have to.

56:35.402 --> 56:38.468
I love you.

56:38.470 --> 56:41.802
That's the first time
you've said it.

56:41.804 --> 56:45.169
I love you too. Always have.

56:53.003 --> 56:56.867
By the way, when we get back, you
should move more of your stuff

56:56.869 --> 56:58.767
into my apartment.

56:58.769 --> 57:01.168
How much?

57:01.170 --> 57:04.237
All of it.

57:07.169 --> 57:08.333
You said you're goodbyes?

57:08.335 --> 57:10.002
Yeah.

57:10.004 --> 57:12.735
OK.

57:12.737 --> 57:17.333
From now on, we stick together,
that way we're stronger.

57:17.335 --> 57:20.067
No one's getting left
behind out here.

57:20.069 --> 57:22.201
Jez can't be too far ahead.

57:22.203 --> 57:25.937
. OK, let's get moving.

57:57.737 --> 58:04.737
Jez! Jez!...Jez!

58:32.202 --> 58:35.935
Jez!

58:38.236 --> 58:40.770
Jez!

59:05.936 --> 59:11.771
Jez!

01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:05.404
Jez!

01:00:10.303 --> 01:00:14.368
I have a very bad feeling.

01:00:14.370 --> 01:00:17.370
I think he's out there.

01:00:24.769 --> 01:00:27.467
Oh my God! It's him!

01:00:27.469 --> 01:00:27.901
Who?

01:00:27.903 --> 01:00:30.900
Do you see him?

01:00:30.902 --> 01:00:32.801
There's no one there.
Cut it out Anita.

01:00:32.803 --> 01:00:34.067
He was right there.

01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:35.233
I think you're hallucinating.

01:00:35.235 --> 01:00:36.168
I saw him.

01:00:36.170 --> 01:00:37.767
Come on.

01:00:37.769 --> 01:00:40.670
I know what I saw Steve.

01:00:52.802 --> 01:00:55.401
I don't think I can walk
on it tomorrow.

01:00:55.403 --> 01:00:56.966
I'll carry you.

01:00:56.968 --> 01:00:58.134
I'm serious.

01:00:58.136 --> 01:01:00.933
So am I.

01:01:00.935 --> 01:01:02.966
I don't want to slow us down.

01:01:02.968 --> 01:01:06.200
Guys I'm worried about Jez.

01:01:06.202 --> 01:01:08.033
He must have gotten out.

01:01:08.035 --> 01:01:12.234
How long before we hit
the logging road?

01:01:12.236 --> 01:01:15.267
Maybe tomorrow.

01:01:15.269 --> 01:01:20.901
Who did you see earlier
today on the trail?

01:01:20.903 --> 01:01:23.901
You won't believe me.

01:01:23.903 --> 01:01:26.770
Try us.

01:01:31.436 --> 01:01:34.467
When my grandfather visited
me last night...

01:01:34.469 --> 01:01:39.169
...he warned me of something
called the Greater Evil.

01:01:42.868 --> 01:01:46.766
I think it's coming for us.

01:01:46.768 --> 01:01:51.766
So your grandfather's
ghost came and...

01:01:51.768 --> 01:01:56.036
Let's turn in.
We've got a long day tomorrow.

01:02:24.768 --> 01:02:28.234
Who the fuck are you?

01:02:28.236 --> 01:02:29.367
Are you the rescue team?

01:02:29.369 --> 01:02:30.400
No... No.

01:02:30.402 --> 01:02:31.233
Are you tracking me?

01:02:31.235 --> 01:02:31.866
No.

01:02:31.868 --> 01:02:33.068
Are you trying to kill me?

01:02:33.070 --> 01:02:35.401
No.

01:02:35.403 --> 01:02:37.301
Please.

01:02:37.303 --> 01:02:40.168
Speak!

01:02:40.170 --> 01:02:42.300
Are you him?

01:02:42.302 --> 01:02:43.101
Who?

01:02:43.103 --> 01:02:44.303
The Greater Evil.

01:02:54.402 --> 01:02:57.767
I can help you.

01:02:57.769 --> 01:03:00.900
What's your name?

01:03:00.902 --> 01:03:03.168
Brandon.

01:03:03.170 --> 01:03:05.703
Special Ops.

01:03:08.437 --> 01:03:10.734
How did you get here?

01:03:10.736 --> 01:03:16.866
I was captured. Held in the
jungle as a POW for years.

01:03:16.868 --> 01:03:21.333
Then one day, the Vietnamese
were gone, and we escaped.

01:03:21.335 --> 01:03:25.300
I've been here ever
since, waiting.

01:03:25.302 --> 01:03:27.935
To be rescued?

01:03:31.102 --> 01:03:32.434
When was this?

01:03:32.436 --> 01:03:35.867
April 1970.

01:03:35.869 --> 01:03:38.367
We were on a secret mission.

01:03:38.369 --> 01:03:40.800
Into Laos?

01:03:40.802 --> 01:03:43.734
How do you know that?
That's classified.

01:03:43.736 --> 01:03:46.167
Not anymore.

01:03:46.169 --> 01:03:48.934
You were never rescued because
the US government didn't want

01:03:48.936 --> 01:03:50.966
the world to know where you
had been captured.

01:03:50.968 --> 01:03:53.033
It was the CIA's ‘Secret War'.

01:03:53.035 --> 01:03:54.133
How do you know all this?

01:03:54.135 --> 01:03:56.933
My grandfather died out here.

01:03:56.935 --> 01:03:59.101
Grandfather?

01:03:59.103 --> 01:04:00.934
What are you from
the fuckin' future?

01:04:00.936 --> 01:04:04.669
You expect me to believe that?

01:04:08.702 --> 01:04:11.867
Look, you gotta help me.

01:04:11.869 --> 01:04:14.933
Something ain't right.

01:04:14.935 --> 01:04:19.367
I've tried to leave, I keep
ending up back in the same place.

01:04:19.369 --> 01:04:23.101
I think I'm losing my mind.

01:04:23.103 --> 01:04:25.801
Shhh... He's close.

01:04:25.803 --> 01:04:28.201
Who?

01:04:28.203 --> 01:04:31.435
The Greater Evil.

01:04:31.437 --> 01:04:34.267
You're really not him?

01:04:34.269 --> 01:04:36.967
Shit kid.

01:04:36.969 --> 01:04:42.301
If he comes for you,
you'll know it.

01:04:42.303 --> 01:04:46.003
You said you could help me?

01:04:47.070 --> 01:04:48.801
Please.

01:04:48.803 --> 01:04:54.037
What I'm gonna tell you sounds
crazy, and it's bad news.

01:04:56.470 --> 01:04:59.101
OK.

01:04:59.103 --> 01:05:03.003
- Give it to me straight.
- Ok.

01:05:04.469 --> 01:05:10.168
You're dead. You died
a long time ago.

01:05:10.170 --> 01:05:11.867
Is that supposed to be
some kind of joke?

01:05:11.869 --> 01:05:13.435
Because it ain't funny.

01:05:13.437 --> 01:05:15.700
- It's not meant to be.
- Then it's some stupid fucking

01:05:15.702 --> 01:05:16.468
bullshit!

01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:19.001
Let me prove it.
I can prove it.

01:05:19.003 --> 01:05:22.103
Please...

01:05:33.968 --> 01:05:38.000
You know this city
as Saigon, right?

01:05:38.002 --> 01:05:40.800
Ho Chi Minh city.

01:05:40.802 --> 01:05:45.367
What the fuck is this?

01:05:45.369 --> 01:05:52.200
Saigon fell in 1975 and
changed its name.

01:05:52.202 --> 01:05:56.869
The world has moved on and
you've been lost to history.

01:05:58.835 --> 01:06:01.401
You mean to tell me.

01:06:01.403 --> 01:06:05.133
I've been out in this jungle.

01:06:05.135 --> 01:06:09.033
For 50 fuckin' years

01:06:09.035 --> 01:06:15.168
Fighting a war that ended
decades ago?

01:06:15.170 --> 01:06:19.168
I'm so sorry.

01:06:19.170 --> 01:06:21.902
It's not your fault kid.

01:06:24.803 --> 01:06:28.835
You've done me a real solid.

01:06:32.703 --> 01:06:36.370
I just gotta get to
where I need to be.

01:06:41.170 --> 01:06:43.969
Take care.

01:07:26.401 --> 01:07:31.134
Great.

01:07:31.136 --> 01:07:33.399
What do we do now?

01:07:33.401 --> 01:07:35.901
How can a trail come
to a dead end?

01:07:35.903 --> 01:07:38.434
It can't just stop here.

01:07:38.436 --> 01:07:40.834
I'll look around.

01:07:40.836 --> 01:07:41.766
I'll come with you.

01:07:41.768 --> 01:07:44.300
No, stay with Rachel.

01:07:44.302 --> 01:07:46.734
I won't go far.

01:07:46.736 --> 01:07:49.736
Be careful.

01:08:14.035 --> 01:08:20.100
Steve, do you think
we'll ever get out?

01:08:20.103 --> 01:08:24.901
I have to.
Now's not the time to lose hope.

01:08:24.903 --> 01:08:28.901
But if this is the
end of the trail.

01:08:28.903 --> 01:08:31.834
What happened to Jez?

01:08:31.836 --> 01:08:33.366
He may have got lucky.

01:08:33.368 --> 01:08:36.868
Found another way.

01:08:42.469 --> 01:08:44.765
Hey! I found a viewpoint.

01:08:44.768 --> 01:08:45.466
Really?

01:08:45.468 --> 01:08:48.200
Yeah.

01:08:48.202 --> 01:08:51.170
We can get our bearings.
Maybe even see a village.

01:08:53.868 --> 01:08:56.200
What are you doing?

01:08:56.202 --> 01:08:57.832
I'm not leaving you.

01:08:57.835 --> 01:09:00.966
You can't get me through that.
Leave me, I'll be fine.

01:09:00.969 --> 01:09:03.233
She's right.
It's not far.

01:09:03.234 --> 01:09:05.832
We'll be quick.

01:09:05.835 --> 01:09:08.167
Don't go anywhere.

01:09:08.169 --> 01:09:09.299
I love you.

01:09:09.301 --> 01:09:12.001
I love you too.

01:09:12.002 --> 01:09:14.237
Be right back.

01:09:32.103 --> 01:09:34.435
Hello?

01:09:35.969 --> 01:09:37.765
Who's there?

01:09:37.768 --> 01:09:41.402
Jez, Jez is that you?

01:10:23.703 --> 01:10:28.068
Guys! Hey guys!

01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:32.936
Guys I think I've found Jez.

01:10:42.102 --> 01:10:45.102
Wow. It's beautiful.

01:10:47.803 --> 01:10:51.767
But there's no roads,
there's no villages.

01:10:51.769 --> 01:10:54.068
This isn't right.

01:10:54.070 --> 01:11:00.267
We're heading west, but we should
be moving east, towards Vietnam.

01:11:00.269 --> 01:11:03.200
You mean we're lost?

01:11:03.202 --> 01:11:05.801
I don't understand it.

01:11:05.803 --> 01:11:08.167
I t doesn't make sense.

01:11:08.169 --> 01:11:13.000
So where's the logging road?

01:11:13.002 --> 01:11:14.433
I have no idea.

01:11:14.435 --> 01:11:17.134
Steve.

01:11:17.136 --> 01:11:19.300
Don't say that. You're the one
who's supposed to be

01:11:19.302 --> 01:11:23.902
getting us out of here.

01:11:34.235 --> 01:11:39.966
Jez! Jez!

01:11:39.968 --> 01:11:43.735
Jez, is that you?

01:12:14.201 --> 01:12:17.736
Steve, Steve.

01:12:22.134 --> 01:12:26.467
Steve.

01:12:26.469 --> 01:12:28.267
Steve!

01:12:28.269 --> 01:12:29.767
Anita!!

01:12:29.769 --> 01:12:32.966
Help me, help! Help! Help!

01:12:32.968 --> 01:12:35.000
Help!

01:12:35.002 --> 01:12:38.769
STEVE!

01:12:43.102 --> 01:12:44.069
Rachel!

01:12:47.135 --> 01:12:48.132
Shit!

01:12:48.134 --> 01:12:49.934
Rachel!

01:12:49.936 --> 01:12:51.967
Where is she?

01:12:51.969 --> 01:12:53.132
She must be here somewhere.

01:12:53.134 --> 01:12:55.133
Rachel!

01:12:55.135 --> 01:12:58.434
- Rachel!
- Rachel!

01:12:58.436 --> 01:13:01.000
Rachel!

01:13:01.002 --> 01:13:03.733
- Rachel!
- Rachel!

01:13:03.735 --> 01:13:06.766
Rachel!

01:13:06.768 --> 01:13:09.232
Rachel!

01:13:09.234 --> 01:13:12.733
I left her right there on the
path! Right there! Rachel!

01:13:12.735 --> 01:13:15.801
- Rachel!
- Rachel!

01:13:15.803 --> 01:13:17.067
What was that explosion?

01:13:17.069 --> 01:13:18.800
Shit!

01:13:18.802 --> 01:13:21.067
Maybe the drug gang took her?

01:13:21.069 --> 01:13:24.967
Oh God. Oh God!

01:13:24.969 --> 01:13:29.202
Rachel!...

01:13:37.803 --> 01:13:40.001
It's been hours.

01:13:40.003 --> 01:13:43.300
She's not here.
Let's get back on the trail.

01:13:43.302 --> 01:13:46.299
I promised I wouldn't
leave her out here.

01:13:46.301 --> 01:13:48.869
We have to face
reality she's...

01:13:51.102 --> 01:13:53.701
Let's find some more help
and come back for her.

01:13:53.703 --> 01:13:55.400
It's the only way.

01:13:55.402 --> 01:14:00.033
I can't leave her, I won't!

01:14:00.035 --> 01:14:05.169
I care about her too, but we're
no use to her dead.

01:14:06.168 --> 01:14:09.168
We have to keep moving, come on.

01:14:27.369 --> 01:14:30.435
Come on Steve.
Let's keep moving.

01:14:52.769 --> 01:14:54.969
I couldn't even protect her.

01:14:56.135 --> 01:14:58.769
Don't say that, you did
what you could.

01:15:02.736 --> 01:15:05.202
It's all my fault.

01:15:09.903 --> 01:15:12.766
If we hadn't taken the detour...

01:15:12.768 --> 01:15:17.032
...the rapids

01:15:17.034 --> 01:15:24.735
...the Guide, Jez, Rachel.

01:15:35.703 --> 01:15:38.236
It's hopeless.

01:15:41.469 --> 01:15:43.369
It's hopeless.

01:15:49.135 --> 01:15:55.870
Hey, we have to keep moving
for Rachel, and Jez.

01:16:05.768 --> 01:16:08.301
Let's get some rest.

01:16:33.134 --> 01:16:34.969
Hello?

01:16:37.436 --> 01:16:40.033
Rachel?

01:16:40.035 --> 01:16:42.701
Hello?

01:16:42.703 --> 01:16:44.803
Rachel!

01:16:55.802 --> 01:16:57.235
Jez!

01:17:10.469 --> 01:17:14.036
It's impossible!

01:17:29.301 --> 01:17:32.101
Steve?

01:17:36.301 --> 01:17:39.035
Steve!

01:18:00.301 --> 01:18:01.736
Shit!

01:18:05.169 --> 01:18:06.268
Help!

01:18:09.301 --> 01:18:12.069
Help!

01:18:21.835 --> 01:18:24.869
Stay back!

01:18:25.801 --> 01:18:27.366
Stay back!

01:18:27.368 --> 01:18:30.299
Hello Anita.

01:18:30.301 --> 01:18:33.368
You don't have to fear me.

01:18:35.835 --> 01:18:37.434
Are you going to kill me?

01:18:37.436 --> 01:18:39.467
Did you kill my friends?

01:18:39.469 --> 01:18:41.832
I don't need to kill you...

01:18:41.834 --> 01:18:45.999
...because you're already dead.

01:18:46.001 --> 01:18:47.399
But don't worry.

01:18:47.401 --> 01:18:50.800
What the fuck is going on?

01:18:50.802 --> 01:18:53.032
What do you mean
‘we're all dead'?

01:18:53.034 --> 01:18:58.670
You drowned at precisely
12:01 p.m. on the river.

01:19:02.034 --> 01:19:05.233
But you're dead too.
I saw you get shot.

01:19:05.235 --> 01:19:12.467
That had to happen, so you'd
believe in me now.

01:19:12.469 --> 01:19:16.066
What about my friends?

01:19:16.068 --> 01:19:18.000
They didn't know they'd died.

01:19:18.002 --> 01:19:20.800
So I helped then move on.

01:19:20.802 --> 01:19:23.436
How do you help them exactly?

01:19:25.867 --> 01:19:29.833
I roam the jungle...

01:19:29.835 --> 01:19:32.300
...tracking the already dead...

01:19:32.302 --> 01:19:37.900
...and those that have not come
to terms with the situation.

01:19:37.902 --> 01:19:42.999
I hunt them and kill them, using
their worst fears.

01:19:43.001 --> 01:19:46.833
It must have been tough fighting
out here, trying to blow each

01:19:46.835 --> 01:19:50.299
other's heads off.

01:19:50.301 --> 01:19:54.833
I'd hate to have been caught in one
of the Viet Cong's booby traps.

01:19:54.835 --> 01:19:58.067
Those fucking bastards were
dangerous with bamboo.

01:19:58.069 --> 01:20:03.367
My grandfather was disabled
by a mine. It blew his leg off.

01:20:03.369 --> 01:20:08.000
Leaving them with in doubt that
this time, they're dead.

01:20:08.002 --> 01:20:12.766
Sounds like a sadistic way to
deliver bad news.

01:20:12.768 --> 01:20:19.100
It has its drawbacks, but
it's effective.

01:20:19.102 --> 01:20:21.000
How long have you
been doing this?

01:20:21.002 --> 01:20:23.733
Lifetimes.

01:20:23.735 --> 01:20:26.200
But now you are here.

01:20:26.202 --> 01:20:27.865
You're different.

01:20:27.867 --> 01:20:30.200
You have a gift.

01:20:30.202 --> 01:20:32.100
What gift?

01:20:32.102 --> 01:20:34.965
The gift of compassion.

01:20:34.967 --> 01:20:39.766
Soul seek you out, they come to you
for help, and you can give it.

01:20:39.768 --> 01:20:44.467
So let me get this straight.

01:20:44.469 --> 01:20:45.668
I'm dead.

01:20:46.235 --> 01:20:50.100
And you want me to stay out
here, herding souls like you do?

01:20:50.102 --> 01:20:52.933
Think about it Anita.

01:20:52.935 --> 01:20:59.132
It is no coincidence that you died in
the same jungle your grandfather did.

01:20:59.134 --> 01:21:04.367
I always believed my grandfather
was betrayed by his country.

01:21:04.369 --> 01:21:06.999
My whole family did.
We never gave up on him.

01:21:07.001 --> 01:21:13.033
It's that empathy, that
connection which is so powerful.

01:21:13.035 --> 01:21:18.199
You can lead them to their
final resting place.

01:21:18.201 --> 01:21:20.200
Who's out here?

01:21:20.202 --> 01:21:25.966
Soldiers from all sides of the
wars that ravaged this jungle.

01:21:25.968 --> 01:21:28.900
Why are there so many Americans?

01:21:28.902 --> 01:21:32.466
POWs from the Vietnam War.

01:21:32.468 --> 01:21:39.699
Ignored, forgotten, left to die and
rot out here by their own country.

01:21:39.701 --> 01:21:41.233
They deserve better.

01:21:41.235 --> 01:21:45.100
And with you they'll get it.

01:21:45.102 --> 01:21:48.966
You can finally free them
from the despair...

01:21:48.968 --> 01:21:53.167
...the betrayal, and this
never-ending jungle.

01:21:53.169 --> 01:21:55.332
Anita.

01:21:55.334 --> 01:21:57.901
Do you accept?

01:22:02.834 --> 01:22:05.900
Because of you, I don't have to spend
the rest of my days being hunted and

01:22:05.902 --> 01:22:08.766
tracked through the jungle.

01:22:08.768 --> 01:22:11.434
You made me realize, no
one's coming for me,

01:22:11.436 --> 01:22:13.133
For us.

01:22:13.135 --> 01:22:16.136
It's time I joined Martha.

01:22:22.234 --> 01:22:25.002
I accept.

01:22:28.134 --> 01:22:31.036
Then my time is at an end.

01:22:33.735 --> 01:22:37.865
And when you guide the last
one out, you too will go.

01:22:37.867 --> 01:22:41.167
But what about the Greater Evil.

01:22:41.169 --> 01:22:45.267
The thing that's coming for us?

01:22:45.269 --> 01:22:48.700
There is no Greater Evil.

01:22:48.702 --> 01:22:52.899
It's just a fear of death of
those caught in limbo.

01:22:52.901 --> 01:22:56.899
They thought I was the Greater
Evil because I hunted, tracked

01:22:56.901 --> 01:22:59.932
and killed them.

01:22:59.934 --> 01:23:05.033
But I was their greatest relief
too, if only they knew it.

01:23:05.035 --> 01:23:07.400
And the drug gang?

01:23:07.402 --> 01:23:13.201
A figment of your imagination.

01:23:20.069 --> 01:23:24.035
It is time.

01:23:31.369 --> 01:23:33.902
Goodbye my child.

01:23:36.001 --> 01:23:38.136
Be strong.

01:23:42.334 --> 01:23:44.802
(whispering) Help me.

01:24:57.268 --> 01:24:58.969
Are you the rescue mission?

01:25:01.834 --> 01:25:04.169
Yes. Yes, I am.

01:25:06.801 --> 01:25:09.168
Please help me.
I want to go home.

01:25:43.410 --> 01:25:48.410
