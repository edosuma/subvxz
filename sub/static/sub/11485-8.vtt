WEBVTT

00:01.518 --> 00:03.076
This is where I sit.

00:03.153 --> 00:05.246
Right on. Good location.

00:06.489 --> 00:07.615
What else?

00:07.691 --> 00:09.022
That's the sink.

00:10.226 --> 00:12.786
If you put your thumb over the hole,
you can squirt water

00:12.862 --> 00:15.126
all the way over to the other side
of the room.

00:16.199 --> 00:17.461
Cool.

00:17.534 --> 00:20.025
I'm not allowed to use the sink anymore.

00:21.104 --> 00:22.469
Got it.

00:23.339 --> 00:27.605
- So, what's the deal with your teacher?
- Miss Tuttle? She's very strict.

00:29.879 --> 00:31.540
That could work.

00:32.949 --> 00:34.814
Did you see this drawing our son made?

00:34.884 --> 00:37.648
It's a cry for his parents
to get back together.

00:37.721 --> 00:40.121
Alan, it's Davy Crockett at the Alamo.

00:40.824 --> 00:43.190
I know. Breaks your heart, doesn't it?

00:44.794 --> 00:46.489
I can see you got your brother here.

00:46.563 --> 00:50.055
Yeah, he wasn't thrilled about it,
but he can't say no to Jake.

00:50.166 --> 00:53.658
And I kind of implied that Miss Tuttle
was a bit of a freak.

00:53.737 --> 00:54.897
Excuse me?

00:55.004 --> 00:58.235
You wanted me to get him here.
He's here. The rest is up to you.

00:59.375 --> 01:01.502
So, come on. You gonna introduce me?

01:01.578 --> 01:04.012
- What for?
- She's your teacher.

01:04.080 --> 01:07.208
You're my nephew. I feel like...
Come on, just do it.

01:08.351 --> 01:11.013
Don't you want to see my model
of a California mission?

01:11.087 --> 01:13.282
- It's made of sugar cubes.
- Okay.

01:13.423 --> 01:15.414
First your mission, then mine.

01:16.726 --> 01:19.456
May I have everyone's attention? Hello.

01:19.696 --> 01:21.789
I'm Judith Harper, the class mom.

01:26.803 --> 01:30.364
I just want to thank you all for coming.
This is a great turnout.

01:30.440 --> 01:32.135
Give yourselves a hand.

01:37.147 --> 01:39.911
I understand you teachers
are sadly underpaid.

01:39.983 --> 01:41.712
That's very true.

01:42.051 --> 01:44.713
I'd like to do my part.
Can I buy you dinner?

01:46.790 --> 01:49.281
So please feel free to put your name
on the sign-up sheets

01:49.359 --> 01:52.522
if you're available
for carpools, coaching, fieldtrips.

01:52.595 --> 01:53.960
Charlie Harper.

01:54.097 --> 01:57.897
Jake's uncle, mentor, pal.

02:04.440 --> 02:07.068
And finally, and this is a biggie, folks.

02:07.143 --> 02:09.270
It looks as if we're gonna have to cancel

02:09.345 --> 02:12.007
our annual music show
for our fourth graders.

02:13.183 --> 02:16.744
Unless someone with music experience
volunteers to help us out.

02:17.654 --> 02:20.316
Anyone? Anyone at all?

02:21.491 --> 02:23.083
- Charlie?
- Yeah.

02:23.526 --> 02:25.790
Thank you. Charlie Harper, everyone.

02:33.970 --> 02:35.301
What?

02:37.000 --> 02:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:49.619 --> 02:51.314
Go ahead, say it.

02:51.688 --> 02:54.555
You traitorous, rat bastard.

02:54.657 --> 02:57.820
Good. You feel better?

02:58.661 --> 03:01.687
You set me up. You lured me
into that classroom

03:01.798 --> 03:04.164
with promises of donuts
and loose women.

03:04.400 --> 03:07.392
I'm sorry. I honestly thought
there'd be donuts.

03:09.172 --> 03:11.402
What about Miss Tuttle? The freak?

03:12.041 --> 03:14.509
She's a married Christian missionary!

03:15.845 --> 03:19.337
Okay, that I just lied about.

03:19.916 --> 03:22.544
But it was for a good cause.
The kids really need you.

03:22.652 --> 03:25.712
Yeah, but see, here's the problem.
I don't like kids.

03:25.889 --> 03:29.290
- You like Jake.
- Jake's different. He's cool. He's our kid.

03:29.726 --> 03:31.523
The rest of them.

03:33.429 --> 03:36.956
- What other kids do you know?
- I see them.

03:37.533 --> 03:39.899
Having tantrums in supermarkets,

03:39.969 --> 03:43.461
screaming in movie theaters,
making everything sticky.

03:46.442 --> 03:50.378
And the whole world gives them
a free ride just because they're cute.

03:50.613 --> 03:53.548
Okay. Forget about the kids.
Do this for me and Judith.

03:53.616 --> 03:55.880
Not really a big Judith fan, either.

03:56.052 --> 03:58.043
Come on. You'll write the music and lyrics.

03:58.121 --> 04:01.386
Judith and I
will produce and direct. Together.

04:02.325 --> 04:03.917
Hold on.

04:04.594 --> 04:07.119
So you roped me into this
because you think

04:07.230 --> 04:10.256
that the three of us collaborating
on a fourth-grade tribute

04:10.333 --> 04:14.167
to the Industrial Revolution will somehow
lead to you getting back together

04:14.237 --> 04:16.262
with your allegedly gay ex-wife?

04:17.673 --> 04:20.575
It's easy to make anything
sound stupid, Charlie.

04:22.145 --> 04:25.842
Look, we're still legally married.
Frankly, I don't buy the whole gay thing.

04:25.949 --> 04:30.443
A gay woman would not fake orgasms
for 12 years just to protect my feelings.

04:33.423 --> 04:35.414
Okay. Take off your seat belt.

04:36.259 --> 04:38.250
- Why?
- Because when I slam on the brakes,

04:38.328 --> 04:41.024
I want to watch you
go through the windshield.

04:42.098 --> 04:45.329
Don't be silly. Do you know how fast
you'd have to be going to...

04:45.435 --> 04:46.993
Hey, slow down.

04:50.306 --> 04:53.434
<i>Manpower, horsepower, coal and steam</i>

04:53.643 --> 04:56.544
<i>Moving forward the American dream</i>

04:56.879 --> 04:59.871
<i>Electric, atomic, solar, too</i>

04:59.983 --> 05:03.282
<i>All this energy for me and you</i>

05:06.622 --> 05:09.284
- I want to like it.
- Yeah, want to like it.

05:12.528 --> 05:15.326
- But?
- But I just don't think it's your best work.

05:15.398 --> 05:17.366
It's not. Fire me, please.

05:18.234 --> 05:21.032
Do you remember that show
that you and I did in college?

05:21.404 --> 05:23.235
<i>Stormy Weather? Sure.</i>

05:23.339 --> 05:25.500
- Now, those songs had a point of view.
- Yeah.

05:25.575 --> 05:27.805
And you couldn't get them
out of your head.

05:27.877 --> 05:31.176
<i>Co-ed bathrooms, co-ed bathrooms</i>

05:31.247 --> 05:34.808
<i>Wear your flip-flops
in the co-ed bathrooms</i>

05:34.917 --> 05:38.045
<i>Stuff grows on the floor there</i>

05:38.154 --> 05:41.351
<i>And whoops! There's another pubic hair</i>

05:44.827 --> 05:48.388
See? Maybe the easiest way to do this
is for us to write the actual song.

05:48.498 --> 05:51.729
Yeah. Then Charlie could just toss in
the specific notes and stuff.

05:51.834 --> 05:53.927
Yeah, Charlie, what do you think?

05:55.605 --> 05:58.836
Okay, then I guess it's just the two of us.

05:59.175 --> 06:02.667
- Like the old days.
- Yeah. Except this time I'm not a virgin.

06:06.749 --> 06:09.877
How come you're not
helping Mom and Dad with the show?

06:10.086 --> 06:11.747
How can I put this?

06:11.854 --> 06:15.847
Your uncle Charlie is a professional
musician, and your mom and dad...

06:16.192 --> 06:17.557
Suck?

06:21.697 --> 06:23.187
Good a word as any.

06:26.102 --> 06:28.366
I think they're gonna get back together.

06:28.438 --> 06:29.632
- You do?
- Yep.

06:29.705 --> 06:32.196
Except if my Dad moves back
to Mom's house,

06:32.275 --> 06:34.072
I probably wouldn't see you anymore.

06:34.143 --> 06:37.977
Of course you'd see me. You'd still have
your room here, and I'd come visit.

06:38.081 --> 06:41.744
- You never visited before.
- That's 'cause I didn't know you before.

06:41.818 --> 06:43.911
That's 'cause you never visited.

06:45.154 --> 06:46.382
Gin.

06:48.424 --> 06:51.916
To tell you the truth, Jake,
I don't think this is gonna be an issue.

06:51.994 --> 06:54.224
You don't think they're gonna
get back together?

06:54.297 --> 06:56.390
- I didn't say that.
- Do you?

06:57.100 --> 06:59.091
- Hey, what do I know?
- I think they are.

06:59.168 --> 07:01.898
<i>Robert Fulton, Eli Whitney</i>

07:01.971 --> 07:04.496
<i>Robert Fulton, Eli Whitney</i>

07:04.607 --> 07:08.304
<i>All aboard for Henry Ford</i>

07:12.648 --> 07:13.740
<i>Henry Ford</i>

07:13.816 --> 07:14.874
And then...

07:14.951 --> 07:16.976
Careful what you wish for, pal.

07:20.756 --> 07:23.452
Charlie, we're gonna be late for rehearsal.

07:27.330 --> 07:30.356
- What are you doing?
- Making margaritas.

07:30.566 --> 07:32.898
But we've got a rehearsal at Jake's school.

07:33.002 --> 07:35.232
Don't worry, I have a plan.

07:37.640 --> 07:40.200
Charlie, you're taking liquor
to Jake's school?

07:40.309 --> 07:41.833
You betcha.

07:42.545 --> 07:46.003
I'm not gonna face all those pre-pubers
without a snootful.

07:47.650 --> 07:50.551
They'll have limes
in the teacher's lounge, right?

07:50.920 --> 07:54.378
No. There's no limes,
there's no swizzle sticks, there's...

07:54.824 --> 07:56.917
- Oh, God.
- What?

07:57.760 --> 07:59.591
It's from Judith's lawyers.

07:59.762 --> 08:01.491
Really? Good news?

08:03.566 --> 08:06.592
No, it's not good news.
Judith filed for divorce.

08:08.070 --> 08:10.595
Man. I'm sorry.

08:11.541 --> 08:13.406
What am I gonna do?

08:14.010 --> 08:16.740
There's a lot of ways to respond
to something like this.

08:16.846 --> 08:19.110
Anger, grief, denial.

08:19.849 --> 08:21.510
What would you do?

08:21.717 --> 08:25.551
I'd probably blow off rehearsal
and start chugging from the blender.

08:28.424 --> 08:31.086
But I wouldn't recommend that
for an amateur.

08:35.063 --> 08:37.554
I can't believe she blind-sided me like this.

08:37.633 --> 08:40.625
Being so nice and friendly to my face.

08:40.703 --> 08:43.638
Meanwhile her lawyers were working
behind my face.

08:43.706 --> 08:45.298
Let me tell you something, Charlie.

08:45.374 --> 08:48.241
A woman who would do such a thing
cannot be trusted.

08:48.311 --> 08:51.474
Yeah, well, maybe you can use
this divorce as a chance to

08:51.581 --> 08:53.811
take a little break from each other.

08:54.450 --> 08:57.214
No, that would be playing
right into her hands.

08:58.054 --> 09:02.081
Alan, your kid's confused enough about
you and his mother. Don't make it worse.

09:02.158 --> 09:04.592
How could I possibly make it any worse?

09:06.462 --> 09:07.759
Let's find out.

09:08.464 --> 09:11.865
Okay, everybody, what we're gonna do
is put the girls on one side

09:11.934 --> 09:13.526
- and the boys on the other.
- Sure.

09:13.603 --> 09:17.699
Start splitting them up early.
That's your answer for everything, isn't it?

09:17.773 --> 09:18.967
Excuse me?

09:19.075 --> 09:23.409
Would Mrs. Plaintiff please see
Mr. Respondent in the hallway?

09:26.082 --> 09:28.312
Watch the kids, we'll be right back.

09:29.752 --> 09:31.379
Wait!

09:36.225 --> 09:38.625
Jake? Where's Jake?

09:51.540 --> 09:54.100
Okay. Everybody take five.

09:56.012 --> 09:57.536
That means sit down.

10:01.083 --> 10:02.641
Stand up.

10:04.787 --> 10:06.152
Hop up and down.

10:08.824 --> 10:10.257
Right on.

10:11.861 --> 10:14.853
But why file for divorce?
We were getting along so well.

10:14.964 --> 10:17.626
We've been getting along
because I don't feel trapped,

10:17.700 --> 10:19.793
suffocated and depressed anymore.

10:19.869 --> 10:23.202
Sure, kick me out,
then work on improving yourself.

10:26.142 --> 10:28.872
Okay. Everybody flap your arms
like a chicken.

10:34.817 --> 10:38.116
Alan, check it out.
I got this amazing power.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.151
Stop.

10:44.327 --> 10:46.522
It's like having my own robot army.

10:51.801 --> 10:54.235
No, wait, where are you going?

10:57.173 --> 11:00.301
- Are we gonna do our songs?
- Hey, I'm just the piano player.

11:00.376 --> 11:03.174
Lerner and Lowe are out in the hallway
working things out.

11:03.245 --> 11:05.213
- Who?
- Lerner and Lowe?

11:05.681 --> 11:07.740
<i>My Fair Lady? Camelot?</i>

11:08.751 --> 11:10.742
Aren't there any gay kids here?

11:14.857 --> 11:18.088
- They're fighting again, aren't they?
- Yeah, what can I tell you.

11:18.194 --> 11:20.992
Your Mom lawyered up
and your Dad is freaking out.

11:21.063 --> 11:23.554
Stay cool, I'll try to get them back in here.

11:23.666 --> 11:27.602
Hey, everybody, Jake's in charge.
So, whatever he says.

11:31.540 --> 11:34.236
Okay, it's been fun.

11:34.343 --> 11:37.369
But I'm officially resigning
as the Mayor of Booger Town.

11:37.446 --> 11:39.073
Not now, Charlie.

11:39.215 --> 11:42.548
You know, I have tried everything I can
to make you happy.

11:42.618 --> 11:46.554
<i>I don't want to rush you or anything,
but have you ever read Lord of the Flies?</i>

11:46.622 --> 11:48.886
But you know what? You know what?
I'm through.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.290
Maybe your lawyers can make you happy.

11:51.394 --> 11:53.419
Your brother's a horse's ass.

11:54.463 --> 11:58.593
Hey, let's not lose sight of who
the real victim of this divorce is.

11:59.101 --> 12:00.466
Me!

12:11.247 --> 12:14.944
Okay, I think we should all calm down
just a little.

12:15.518 --> 12:18.544
You're not our teacher.
Why should we listen to you?

12:19.588 --> 12:21.681
Okay, let me put it another way.

12:21.857 --> 12:24.348
Shut up and sit down!

12:28.931 --> 12:30.364
Thanks.

12:30.900 --> 12:33.926
Now, listen, rehearsal's over.
You can all go home.

12:34.036 --> 12:35.594
What about our play?

12:36.071 --> 12:38.699
You know how they say,
"The show must go on"?

12:38.774 --> 12:41.106
They weren't talking about this show.

12:42.645 --> 12:45.773
- Your uncle's so lame.
- Is not. He's cool.

12:45.981 --> 12:47.710
- Yeah, right.
- He is.

12:47.783 --> 12:50.217
He's almost famous.
He wrote the Maple Loops song.

12:50.286 --> 12:52.151
- Did not.
- Did, too!

12:53.989 --> 12:56.981
- Prove it.
- You see that Jaguar in the parking lot?

12:58.160 --> 12:59.627
Maple Loops.

13:00.596 --> 13:02.791
That doesn't prove anything.

13:04.467 --> 13:05.900
Fine.

13:09.972 --> 13:13.635
<i>It's got oats and corns and wheat</i>

13:13.742 --> 13:18.111
<i>It's the sweetest breakfast treat
It's maple-licious</i>

13:21.250 --> 13:25.016
- Everybody knows that?
- Of course. It's the Maple Loops song.

13:25.120 --> 13:29.113
- Uncle Charlie, do Fudge Nuggets.
- Yeah! Fudge Nuggets!

13:30.626 --> 13:33.618
<i>From the magic chocolate mountain</i>

13:33.696 --> 13:35.960
<i>In a secret chocolate mine</i>

13:36.031 --> 13:38.192
<i>Come granny's big fudge nuggets</i>

13:38.300 --> 13:42.634
<i>With a taste that's oh so fine</i>

13:46.609 --> 13:49.134
What do you know.
Maybe I don't hate kids.

14:00.456 --> 14:01.684
Hi.

14:01.790 --> 14:04.725
I'm sorry I didn't give you
a heads up about the divorce papers.

14:04.827 --> 14:06.385
I'm sorry if I overreacted.

14:06.495 --> 14:08.292
Just the girls.

14:10.966 --> 14:13.457
- What's going on in there?
- I don't know.

14:14.970 --> 14:16.835
<i>Smell like a man</i>

14:17.306 --> 14:19.399
<i>Stick, pump or can</i>

14:19.542 --> 14:22.534
<i>With Dry Guy Deodorant</i>

14:22.645 --> 14:25.136
<i>Only the girls get sweaty</i>

14:28.751 --> 14:30.651
We're getting there.

14:30.719 --> 14:32.243
Okay, thank you, Charlie.

14:32.354 --> 14:34.254
Yeah, we'll take it from here, okay?

14:34.356 --> 14:36.051
Too late. You're out.

14:36.926 --> 14:38.587
What about the songs we wrote?

14:38.694 --> 14:41.356
Hey, kids, what do you think about
the songs they wrote?

14:41.430 --> 14:43.762
They're bad.

14:48.203 --> 14:49.727
These are my people.

14:51.073 --> 14:54.668
What do your jingles have to do
with the Industrial Revolution?

14:56.278 --> 14:58.712
Look, you wanted a show,
I'm giving you a show.

14:58.781 --> 15:00.942
Now step back and let us work.

15:01.784 --> 15:04.685
Plumber in a Jar.
Let's really sell it this time.

15:06.522 --> 15:10.686
<i>When your sink backs up
there's just one star</i>

15:10.793 --> 15:13.387
<i>It's the one you trust
It's Plumber in a Jar</i>

15:13.462 --> 15:15.089
<i>Plumber in a Jar</i>

15:25.975 --> 15:27.533
Hey, what you doing?

15:28.911 --> 15:33.371
I'm trying to find some plausible
connection between my jingles

15:33.482 --> 15:35.473
and the Industrial Revolution.

15:37.319 --> 15:39.549
- What's up?
- I just talked to my dad.

15:39.922 --> 15:43.289
He said that he and Mom
aren't getting back together again.

15:43.959 --> 15:45.290
Yeah.

15:46.295 --> 15:49.423
- How you doing with that?
- I'm not sure.

15:49.565 --> 15:51.829
I like that I get to stay here on weekends.

15:51.934 --> 15:53.799
That's cool. I like that, too.

15:53.902 --> 15:56.462
But you gotta be sad about your folks,
though, right?

15:56.572 --> 15:57.903
No, I'm okay.

15:59.842 --> 16:03.107
Jake, it's okay to feel sad, I've been told.

16:05.247 --> 16:08.478
- And this is a sad thing.
- My dad's not sad.

16:08.584 --> 16:10.984
Of course he is.
He's just trying to protect you.

16:11.086 --> 16:13.520
- From what?
- From being sad.

16:15.357 --> 16:19.623
Yeah, I know it's a vicious circle.
But the liquor industry is built on it.

16:20.462 --> 16:23.329
- What?
- It's not important.

16:23.465 --> 16:27.367
All you need to know is that
we all feel sad sometimes and it's okay.

16:28.137 --> 16:30.469
- Understand?
- Yeah.

16:38.047 --> 16:39.605
Hey, buddy.

16:41.183 --> 16:42.775
It's okay, Dad.

16:52.528 --> 16:56.487
Before the Industrial Revolution,
we lived in an agrarian society.

16:56.565 --> 17:00.160
Most people grew their own food and
ate what they grew. Breakfast involved...

17:00.235 --> 17:01.930
...slaughtering animals...

17:02.004 --> 17:03.562
...and milking cows.

17:04.006 --> 17:06.873
It would be hundreds of years
before people could enjoy

17:06.974 --> 17:10.911
a pre-packaged and nutritious breakfast.
And what's in that breakfast?

17:11.880 --> 17:15.509
<i>It's got oats and corns and wheat</i>

17:15.584 --> 17:18.314
<i>It's the sweetest breakfast treat</i>

17:18.387 --> 17:20.651
<i>It's maple-licious</i>

17:21.256 --> 17:25.249
As urbanization led to stress and
loneliness, industrial society looked

17:25.359 --> 17:29.387
to an ancient agrarian product for
a delicious and refreshing solution.

17:30.766 --> 17:33.496
<i>The girls look prettier
with Hammerstein beer</i>

17:33.569 --> 17:36.333
<i>You like what you see
and you like what you hear</i>

17:36.405 --> 17:39.033
<i>Have a cold frosty mug and pull her near</i>

17:39.108 --> 17:41.872
<i>The girls look prettier</i>

17:41.944 --> 17:44.742
<i>The girls look prettier
with Hammerstein beer</i>

17:46.448 --> 17:49.281
We're not letting him
anywhere near the Christmas pageant.

17:49.384 --> 17:50.749
Agreed.

17:56.024 --> 17:58.151
Even with the advent of indoor plumbing,

17:58.227 --> 18:01.663
the Industrial Revolution
still had some bugs in the system.

18:01.730 --> 18:03.561
What was man to do?

18:04.166 --> 18:05.656
Three, four...

18:05.734 --> 18:08.225
<i>If your home is bug infested</i>

18:08.303 --> 18:11.136
<i>Filled with spiders, flies, and gnats</i>

18:11.240 --> 18:13.708
<i>All our sprays are safety tested</i>

18:13.776 --> 18:17.712
<i>We kill vermin, not your cats</i>
