WEBVTT

00:03.536 --> 00:06.238
- Okay, I read to ally.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.107
- Aw, thanks for putting her
to bed for me, ray.

00:08.109 --> 00:10.642
It's been a really long day.

00:10.644 --> 00:13.412
- I read her "rapunzel."

00:13.414 --> 00:14.713
- Good for you.

00:14.715 --> 00:17.449
- Yeah, I don't know.

00:17.451 --> 00:18.449
- See, I was kidding around,

00:18.451 --> 00:20.119
And I said that if you
live in a tower

00:20.121 --> 00:21.754
And there's no shampoo

00:21.756 --> 00:23.422
And your hair gets long enough
to climb on,

00:23.424 --> 00:25.424
It might get disgusting.

00:27.727 --> 00:29.228
- Yeah?

00:29.230 --> 00:32.164
- Well, so ally wants a haircut.

00:32.166 --> 00:33.565
- Oh, well,
we'll get her a haircut.

00:35.201 --> 00:38.771
- Now.

00:38.773 --> 00:40.305
- Ray, don't tell me
I have to go up--

00:40.307 --> 00:42.574
- I'm ready, mommy!

00:48.415 --> 00:52.084
- I gave her a dollar
to tip you with.

00:52.086 --> 00:53.085
Act surprised.

00:56.189 --> 00:58.457
- Hi, I'm ray, and I live here
in long island

00:58.459 --> 01:01.593
With my wife debra,

01:01.595 --> 01:05.464
My six-year-old daughter,
and twin two-year-old boys.

01:05.466 --> 01:08.400
My parents...

01:08.402 --> 01:18.510
Live across the street.

01:18.512 --> 01:33.792
Live across the street.

01:33.794 --> 01:36.095
- Okay, ally, daddy's gonna
be home any minute with dinner,

01:36.097 --> 01:40.099
So let's clean up.

01:40.101 --> 01:42.534
Sweetie, why don't you take
all your dolls off the table

01:42.536 --> 01:45.304
And wash your hands, okay?

01:45.306 --> 01:47.439
- Grandma, look.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.274
- Ally, please clean up.

01:49.276 --> 01:53.412
- Oh, isn't that nice?

01:53.414 --> 01:55.114
What's this one,
a streetwalker?

01:55.116 --> 01:57.216
- No, she's an aerobics
instructor, marie.

01:57.218 --> 01:58.450
She's dressed for the gym.

01:58.452 --> 01:59.518
Ally, can you look at me?

01:59.520 --> 02:00.752
Are you having trouble
listening?

02:04.124 --> 02:05.891
- All right, come on.

02:05.893 --> 02:07.392
This is from nemo's,

02:07.394 --> 02:10.162
So let's get to it before
it eats through the bag.

02:10.164 --> 02:11.730
Help ally get ready
for dinner, please.

02:11.732 --> 02:13.132
And can you get rid of them?

02:13.134 --> 02:15.567
- [groans]

02:15.569 --> 02:16.768
Hey, guys.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.437
- Hi.
Oh, daddy's home.

02:18.439 --> 02:20.539
- It's time to go home now.

02:20.541 --> 02:22.207
- Hey, I'm watching the game.

02:22.209 --> 02:25.277
- I think they're beaming it
into your house too, dad.

02:25.279 --> 02:27.579
- Dad's taping channel 5
over there.

02:27.581 --> 02:28.914
- 5, why?
What's on 5?

02:28.916 --> 02:30.516
- He wants to catch
that commercial

02:30.518 --> 02:31.750
For the chicken restaurant.

02:31.752 --> 02:33.685
- Oh, the one
where it's so good,

02:33.687 --> 02:35.187
The chicken goes there
to eat it?

02:35.189 --> 02:36.822
- I'm dying
to see it, yeah.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.924
- Yeah, ray, please,
we're all dying here.

02:38.926 --> 02:41.360
- All right, look, we're eating,
man, come on.

02:41.362 --> 02:43.595
- Ally, don't make me
keep asking you, sweetie.

02:43.597 --> 02:46.398
Get the toys picked up
and your hands washed.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.367
- Hey, look, look.
There it is.

02:48.369 --> 02:49.401
- May I take your order?

02:49.403 --> 02:51.370
[clucking]

02:51.372 --> 02:54.173
[laughter]

02:55.708 --> 02:57.442
- Dad, did I tell you?
It's a killer.

02:57.444 --> 02:58.510
- You didn't lie.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.279
- Ally, I'm done asking you.

03:00.281 --> 03:01.914
I want the toys picked up now.

03:01.916 --> 03:03.482
- No!

03:03.484 --> 03:05.384
- If you don't do
what I'm telling you right now,

03:05.386 --> 03:06.451
You can forget
about dessert.

03:06.453 --> 03:08.820
- Ooh, no dessert.

03:08.822 --> 03:11.223
- I don't want
any stupid dessert!

03:11.225 --> 03:12.658
- Oh, my.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.193
- Sure, you do.

03:14.195 --> 03:15.661
- Ray, I can't
take this anymore.

03:15.663 --> 03:16.562
Could you handle it, please?

03:16.564 --> 03:18.797
- All right, I got it.

03:18.799 --> 03:21.800
Ally, wash your hands
and do what mom--

03:21.802 --> 03:23.302
Don't make mommy mad.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.437
- No.

03:25.439 --> 03:27.472
- Look, you have to do
what mommy says.

03:27.474 --> 03:28.473
- Why?

03:28.475 --> 03:29.641
- 'cause I do.

03:32.712 --> 03:34.413
- Grandma's got some candy

03:34.415 --> 03:35.414
For a girl who cleans up.

03:35.416 --> 03:37.282
- No, candy, mom.

03:37.284 --> 03:38.884
Come on.

03:38.886 --> 03:42.221
Mom, you don't pay her
up front.

03:42.223 --> 03:43.322
- Just watch.

03:43.324 --> 03:44.489
All right, now, honey.

03:44.491 --> 03:45.424
Clean up, sweetheart.

03:45.426 --> 03:47.459
- No.

03:47.461 --> 03:49.861
- Candy always worked.

03:49.863 --> 03:52.397
I don't know what debra's done
to this child.

03:52.399 --> 03:53.966
- Look, just let me
handle it, all right?

03:53.968 --> 03:56.368
Ally, I'm gonna give you to
the count of three, all right?

03:56.370 --> 03:57.669
And if you don't start
picking up your toys,

03:57.671 --> 03:59.371
No tv for a week.

03:59.373 --> 04:02.007
- Jeez.
- Oh, no.

04:02.009 --> 04:05.377
- One...

04:05.379 --> 04:08.513
Two...

04:08.515 --> 04:09.414
I'm not kidding.

04:09.416 --> 04:12.618
One, two...

04:12.620 --> 04:14.286
This is it.

04:14.288 --> 04:16.455
2 1/2...

04:16.457 --> 04:19.258
2 3/4.

04:19.260 --> 04:20.559
Let me tell you something, ally.

04:20.561 --> 04:22.294
I don't know
any more fractions, okay?

04:24.964 --> 04:25.964
Three.
That's all.

04:25.966 --> 04:26.965
No tv for a week.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.300
- Nooo!

04:30.003 --> 04:31.737
- Now, what happened?

04:31.739 --> 04:32.738
- I handled it, all right?

04:32.740 --> 04:33.739
Everything--

04:33.741 --> 04:34.873
Everything worked out.

04:34.875 --> 04:37.376
- I hate you!

04:37.378 --> 04:40.646
- [gasps]

04:40.648 --> 04:42.514
- Okay, folks,
let's keep it moving.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.416
Show's over.
Nothing more to see here.

04:44.418 --> 04:45.484
Come on.
Let's go.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.686
- What's wrong with you?

04:47.688 --> 04:48.787
How can you yell
at your child

04:48.789 --> 04:50.355
In front of other people?

04:50.357 --> 04:52.457
Don't you know
how humiliating that can be?

04:52.459 --> 04:53.725
Oh.

04:53.727 --> 04:56.428
[door slams]

04:56.430 --> 04:57.029
- I hate you.

05:07.640 --> 05:08.840
- Hey, lucky pants.

05:11.678 --> 05:14.346
- Thank you very much, ray.

05:14.348 --> 05:17.549
- You're welcome.

05:17.551 --> 05:19.518
What'd I do?

05:19.520 --> 05:23.021
- You know, I haven't had
a minute to myself all day.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.623
You know, when you
take tv away from ally,

05:24.625 --> 05:26.491
You're punishing me too.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.593
- Oh.

05:28.595 --> 05:30.329
- You know what my day
was like?

05:30.331 --> 05:31.897
Went something like this:

05:31.899 --> 05:32.898
"I want to watch tv."

05:32.900 --> 05:33.899
"no."

05:33.901 --> 05:34.900
"I want to watch tv."

05:34.902 --> 05:35.901
"no."

05:35.903 --> 05:37.469
"I want to watch tv."

05:37.471 --> 05:38.437
"no."

05:38.439 --> 05:40.872
Lunch.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.107
"I want to watch tv."
"no."

05:42.109 --> 05:43.108
"I want to watch tv."

05:43.110 --> 05:44.109
"no."

05:44.111 --> 05:45.877
"hey, lucky pants."

05:48.448 --> 05:50.515
- That's where I came in.

05:50.517 --> 05:51.883
- Yeah, what are you gonna do
for me next, ray,

05:51.885 --> 05:53.618
Take away her nap time?

05:53.620 --> 05:55.454
- Look, when a kid
misbehaves,

05:55.456 --> 05:57.823
You take away something
that's important to her.

05:57.825 --> 05:59.424
What would you have done?

05:59.426 --> 06:01.493
- Honestly, I have no idea.

06:01.495 --> 06:02.994
- Well, then I think

06:02.996 --> 06:05.964
We shouldn't dump on the people
who have ideas.

06:08.501 --> 06:09.735
- Okay.

06:09.737 --> 06:10.769
Here's an idea, then.

06:13.573 --> 06:15.140
- "parent effectiveness
training:

06:15.142 --> 06:18.543
Coping with your child's
behavioral challenges."

06:18.545 --> 06:19.543
Where'd you get this?

06:19.545 --> 06:21.446
- They were sticking them
on the windshield

06:21.448 --> 06:24.049
At chuck e. Cheese's.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.584
- Come on, look,
we don't need classes.

06:25.586 --> 06:27.452
We're great parents.

06:27.454 --> 06:28.820
All right,
you're a great parent,

06:28.822 --> 06:31.490
And I'm your lovely assistant.

06:31.492 --> 06:33.024
- Well, I don't feel
like a great parent.

06:33.026 --> 06:34.693
Great parents don't
find themselves

06:34.695 --> 06:35.794
In the supermarket going,

06:35.796 --> 06:38.463
"we don't throw plums!"

06:38.465 --> 06:39.831
I need a class.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.466
We need a class.

06:41.468 --> 06:42.467
- A parenting class?

06:42.469 --> 06:44.169
That's supposed to come natural.

06:44.171 --> 06:47.539
That'd be like taking
a smelling class.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.074
- So you have nothing
to learn here?

06:49.076 --> 06:51.076
- Oh, come on.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.944
My mom and dad never
took a parenting class.

06:57.884 --> 06:59.184
I'm signing them up for this.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.457
- So if you've ruled out
any medical problem

07:05.459 --> 07:07.125
And your child is
still wetting the bed,

07:07.127 --> 07:10.195
He may be trying
to tell you something.

07:10.197 --> 07:11.797
- He's telling you,
"I have to pee."

07:14.967 --> 07:17.502
- So I think we're gonna
wrap it up for tonight,

07:17.504 --> 07:19.771
But before we do,

07:19.773 --> 07:21.206
Are there any other questions?

07:21.208 --> 07:22.707
Yes, uh, debra.

07:22.709 --> 07:25.043
- Yeah, um, we have
a six-year-old daughter,

07:25.045 --> 07:26.812
And she's a great kid,

07:26.814 --> 07:28.680
But she's been
having trouble listening,

07:28.682 --> 07:30.982
And she's been
very stubborn lately.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.584
- But that's every kid.
- It's not--

07:32.586 --> 07:34.052
- It's just a phase, right?

07:34.054 --> 07:35.754
- Well, this is
a perfect opportunity

07:35.756 --> 07:38.156
For you to try
some active listening.

07:38.158 --> 07:39.791
- Thank you.
We'll try that.

07:39.793 --> 07:40.926
- Wait a second.
Wait.

07:40.928 --> 07:42.093
So active listening?

07:42.095 --> 07:43.795
I'm not familiar with that.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.464
- Well, it's encouraging
your child

07:45.466 --> 07:47.799
To express herself verbally
without influencing her

07:47.801 --> 07:51.603
With your own preconceived
notions or opinions.

07:51.605 --> 07:55.006
- Got it.
Here we go.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.241
- Why don't we try
to illustrate this

07:56.243 --> 07:57.542
With a little role-playing?

07:57.544 --> 07:58.977
Let's have you--
ray, is it?

07:58.979 --> 08:01.213
- No, uh...

08:01.215 --> 08:03.582
Yeah, yeah.

08:03.584 --> 08:05.650
- Ray, why don't we have you
come to the front of the class?

08:05.652 --> 08:07.786
- Why don't you go?
Why don't you go, deb?

08:07.788 --> 08:09.788
- You'll be fine.
Don't be shy.

08:09.790 --> 08:12.190
Now, ray, let's just say
that I'm your daughter,

08:12.192 --> 08:16.828
And I refuse to go to visit
grandma on her birthday.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.630
- Well, in this case,
I happen to know grandma,

08:18.632 --> 08:19.931
And I can't say I blame you.

08:27.273 --> 08:29.274
- Just hypothetically,
ray, all right?

08:29.276 --> 08:30.775
Focus.

08:30.777 --> 08:32.277
Now, let's just say, ray,

08:32.279 --> 08:33.812
That you want to get
from your daughter

08:33.814 --> 08:34.813
What she's really feeling.

08:34.815 --> 08:37.282
Go ahead.

08:37.284 --> 08:40.685
- Do it.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.621
- Okay.

08:42.623 --> 08:45.190
Daughter...

08:45.192 --> 08:46.758
You have to go
to grandma's house.

08:46.760 --> 08:47.993
- I'm not going.

08:52.131 --> 08:53.899
- Uh, well, you have to go.

08:53.901 --> 08:54.899
It's her birthday.

08:54.901 --> 08:57.068
- I hate when you
make me do things!

08:57.070 --> 09:00.539
- [sighs]

09:00.541 --> 09:02.007
Look, I'm not making you go,
okay?

09:02.009 --> 09:03.875
It's grandma's birthday.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.310
There aren't gonna be
many more of them.

09:05.312 --> 09:06.111
- Oh.

09:11.751 --> 09:13.552
Now, see, I'm gonna stop you
just for a second, ray.

09:13.554 --> 09:15.020
Um, you see,

09:15.022 --> 09:16.187
I don't think,
at this point,

09:16.189 --> 09:19.124
We need to discuss
grandma's mortality.

09:19.126 --> 09:20.926
- What are you doing, ray?
Don't--

09:20.928 --> 09:22.294
- I'm playing the game.

09:22.296 --> 09:24.629
- It's not a game--
- it's okay. It's okay.

09:24.631 --> 09:26.865
Ray, if I say to you,

09:26.867 --> 09:28.233
"I hate when you
make me do things,"

09:28.235 --> 09:30.201
Perhaps you could
acknowledge my feelings

09:30.203 --> 09:31.736
By saying something like,

09:31.738 --> 09:34.806
"you feel you don't have
any control over our plans."

09:34.808 --> 09:36.975
You understand?

09:36.977 --> 09:40.211
- That doesn't sound like
something I would say.

09:40.213 --> 09:41.713
- Just takes
a little practice.

09:41.715 --> 09:44.149
Come on,
let's keep going.

09:44.151 --> 09:45.150
- Yeah, let's.

09:45.152 --> 09:46.618
Let's...

09:46.620 --> 09:48.086
- All my friends
are going to the park,

09:48.088 --> 09:51.122
But I have to go
to some boring party?

09:51.124 --> 09:53.892
- Uh, you think that the party's
gonna be boring?

09:53.894 --> 09:55.327
- That's it, ray.

09:55.329 --> 09:57.028
See, you're reflecting
her feelings back.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.030
Yes, it's just
a bunch of grown-ups

09:59.032 --> 10:00.231
Sitting around an old house.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.634
I want to be
with my friends!

10:02.636 --> 10:05.003
- But grandma has
that big bowl of coffee nips.

10:07.974 --> 10:10.275
- I don't care,
and you can't make me.

10:10.277 --> 10:12.077
- What are you doing?
- I'm not going.

10:12.079 --> 10:14.012
- Please get up.
Will you get up?

10:14.014 --> 10:15.080
- Why do I have to go?

10:15.082 --> 10:16.281
- Well, I don't know.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.282
- But why?

10:17.284 --> 10:18.750
- Why?
Because I said so!

10:18.752 --> 10:19.751
Huh?

10:22.188 --> 10:24.356
That was big when I was a kid.

10:24.358 --> 10:26.358
All right, look,
mommy said you got to go.

10:26.360 --> 10:28.126
- Leave mommy out of it, ray.
- Thank you.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.394
- Look, you'd better
get up, or--

10:29.396 --> 10:30.395
- Or what?

10:30.397 --> 10:32.330
- Or no more tv.
- No, ray.

10:32.332 --> 10:34.265
- Okay, or you're going
to boarding school.

10:37.203 --> 10:38.703
- Do you always threaten?

10:38.705 --> 10:39.704
- No.

10:39.706 --> 10:40.805
No, sometimes she yells.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.841
- Oh, ray.

10:42.843 --> 10:43.975
- I'm sorry,
we've run out of time.

10:43.977 --> 10:44.976
Thank you all for coming.

10:44.978 --> 10:45.977
I'll see you next week.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.379
Ray and debra,

10:47.381 --> 10:48.980
I'd like you to stay
after class, please.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.049
I think we need to talk.

10:51.051 --> 10:52.050
- Nice going.

10:52.052 --> 10:53.051
- Oh, what, my fault?

10:53.053 --> 10:54.319
- You raised your hand.

11:10.236 --> 11:11.169
- [laughs]

11:11.171 --> 11:12.170
Chicken.

11:16.075 --> 11:17.409
- [sighs]

11:17.411 --> 11:18.410
Chicken.

11:20.246 --> 11:21.713
- What are you doing?

11:21.715 --> 11:23.014
- We've got homework to do.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.149
- Oh, no, no.

11:24.151 --> 11:26.117
I'm not doing
any stinking homework.

11:26.119 --> 11:28.286
- You are the reason
we got the homework.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.255
- You're the brownnose
who had to ask a question.

11:30.257 --> 11:32.223
- I'm trying
to learn here, ray.

11:32.225 --> 11:34.726
What, am I supposed to do
these exercises by myself?

11:34.728 --> 11:37.696
- Can you?

11:37.698 --> 11:40.065
- No, you've got to
do them with me.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.833
- Come on.

11:41.835 --> 11:42.767
- This time, you be the kid.

11:42.769 --> 11:44.703
It'll be less of a stretch.

11:44.705 --> 11:47.806
- Oh, you think
you can take me on?

11:47.808 --> 11:49.174
- Okay, here.

11:49.176 --> 11:50.875
This is perfect.

11:50.877 --> 11:51.875
You're 12 years old,

11:51.877 --> 11:54.379
And you refuse to shovel
the snow off the driveway.

11:54.381 --> 11:57.482
- [laughs]

11:57.484 --> 11:59.851
- Uh...

11:59.853 --> 12:01.052
Ray, could you please
shovel the--

12:01.054 --> 12:05.223
- No.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.025
- Okay, I understand,

12:07.027 --> 12:08.860
Because shoveling the snow
can be hard.

12:08.862 --> 12:11.329
- Yeah, so why did you ask?

12:11.331 --> 12:13.732
- Because, uh, you're a member
of this family,

12:13.734 --> 12:14.799
And we help each other.

12:14.801 --> 12:16.167
- Yeah, tough noogies.

12:16.169 --> 12:17.335
- All right, time-out.

12:17.337 --> 12:18.336
- What?

12:18.338 --> 12:20.405
- Time-out.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.440
Are you being
ray the little kid

12:22.442 --> 12:25.243
Or ray the big ass?

12:25.245 --> 12:27.812
- I'd like to be both.

12:27.814 --> 12:29.280
- Can we just
do the exercise?

12:29.282 --> 12:30.281
- Go ahead.

12:30.283 --> 12:31.282
- Okay.

12:31.284 --> 12:33.118
Um...

12:33.120 --> 12:34.919
Okay, I know that you feel

12:34.921 --> 12:37.188
That making you shovel
is unfair.

12:37.190 --> 12:39.858
- Yes, yes,
I have to shovel the snow,

12:39.860 --> 12:41.493
I have to take out
the garbage,

12:41.495 --> 12:43.828
I have to load
the dishwasher

12:43.830 --> 12:46.931
While you're up in bed
not sleeping with daddy.

12:50.803 --> 12:56.207
- Well, we all have chores
we don't like to do,

12:56.209 --> 12:59.778
But in the future,
little ray,

12:59.780 --> 13:01.813
If you feel that
you have too much to do,

13:01.815 --> 13:03.281
You just tell me,

13:03.283 --> 13:05.483
And I'll try to make things
more even.

13:05.485 --> 13:07.218
So how about
that driveway?

13:07.220 --> 13:08.987
- I'm too tired right now.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.789
I win.

13:10.791 --> 13:12.490
- Ray, this isn't about
winning or losing.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.826
- Oh, boy, you know
who always says that?

13:14.828 --> 13:16.027
The loser.

13:19.932 --> 13:23.234
- I am just trying to do
this active listening stuff,

13:23.236 --> 13:25.103
And you are not
playing right.

13:25.105 --> 13:26.538
- You're gonna say that
to your kid?

13:26.540 --> 13:29.474
- Well, it's just obvious
you're trying to screw it up.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.342
- Well, I'm a real
little kid.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.545
- Yes, you are, and no tv.

13:33.547 --> 13:35.180
- Aha!
See?

13:35.182 --> 13:36.181
- Oh, come on.

13:36.183 --> 13:37.549
- See, no tv.
That's all.

13:37.551 --> 13:38.983
See, you couldn't
do it either.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.385
- Oh, yes, you are right.
You are right.

13:40.387 --> 13:41.586
I just stink.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.154
I just stink
at the whole thing.

13:48.394 --> 13:50.595
- Come on.

13:50.597 --> 13:53.164
It'll be okay.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.165
Aw, come on.

13:58.270 --> 13:59.838
- [sniffles]

13:59.840 --> 14:01.005
- I'll shovel the snow.

14:03.209 --> 14:04.209
- It's not that.

14:04.211 --> 14:06.311
It's just that...

14:06.313 --> 14:09.347
When we got home tonight,
I tried this stuff on ally,

14:09.349 --> 14:10.982
And it didn't work on her,

14:10.984 --> 14:12.183
And it's not working
on you either.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.219
It's just not working.

14:14.221 --> 14:15.453
- Come on.

14:15.455 --> 14:16.855
Don't worry.

14:16.857 --> 14:18.456
It'll be okay.

14:18.458 --> 14:21.092
It's all right.

14:21.094 --> 14:24.062
- I'm flunking the class, ray!

14:24.064 --> 14:25.597
- You're flunking--
I--

14:25.599 --> 14:27.065
Listen, don't worry
about the class.

14:27.067 --> 14:30.468
I told you
we didn't need a class.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.403
The answer to
how to stop plum throwing

14:32.405 --> 14:34.172
Is not in a workbook.

14:34.174 --> 14:36.941
This is a seat-of-the-pants
operation here.

14:36.943 --> 14:38.209
- Well, what are we gonna do?

14:38.211 --> 14:39.644
How are we gonna
get ally to behave?

14:41.580 --> 14:42.647
- The crying's pretty good.

14:50.623 --> 14:52.023
- Hey.

14:52.025 --> 14:54.425
- Hey, ray,
get in on some of this.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.461
- What's she doing,
just laying out a buffet now?

14:56.463 --> 14:58.162
- This is supposed to be
for the week.

14:58.164 --> 14:59.163
- You'll cook some more.

14:59.165 --> 15:00.632
- Oh?

15:00.634 --> 15:02.600
Go ahead, honey,
you look hungry.

15:02.602 --> 15:04.202
I'll heat up the ziti.

15:04.204 --> 15:05.670
- Listen, mom,
when you were babysitting,

15:05.672 --> 15:07.171
Did you change
the twins' pajamas?

15:07.173 --> 15:08.907
- Yeah,
they're over here.

15:08.909 --> 15:11.109
I wanted to treat
some of those old spots.

15:11.111 --> 15:12.610
- We have
a washing machine, ma.

15:12.612 --> 15:17.081
- Yeah, I know, but stubborn
stains need special care.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.316
- Maybe you can take
a class on that.

15:20.619 --> 15:23.388
I got to go to
grandparenting class at 3:00.

15:23.390 --> 15:25.490
[laughter]

15:25.492 --> 15:27.525
Today we're learning
"got your nose"

15:27.527 --> 15:29.027
And "pull my finger."

15:29.029 --> 15:31.062
[laughter]

15:31.064 --> 15:32.363
- Good one, dad.

15:32.365 --> 15:33.631
- Make sure you don't
miss the seminar

15:33.633 --> 15:36.034
On moving to florida.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.635
Look, ma, just give me
the pajamas, please.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.003
And the ziti.

15:39.005 --> 15:41.239
- Frank, what the hell is this?

15:41.241 --> 15:43.141
- I'm not ready
for ice cream yet.

15:43.143 --> 15:45.343
- This is
our tax refund check.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.946
It was stuck to the bottom
of the ice cream.

15:47.948 --> 15:49.180
You've been on my back
for a month,

15:49.182 --> 15:51.115
Telling me that I lost it.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.717
I'm not the one who eats
ice cream in this house.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.419
- Oh, you eat ice cream.

15:54.421 --> 15:56.120
- Tofutti.
I eat tofutti.

15:56.122 --> 15:57.622
- You tell your friends
you eat tofutti,

15:57.624 --> 15:59.090
But then you eat
my ice cream.

15:59.092 --> 16:00.525
Take a look at the tofutti.

16:00.527 --> 16:03.094
There's not a dent
in the tofutti.

16:03.096 --> 16:04.462
- If I do eat ice cream,

16:04.464 --> 16:06.164
And I'm not saying that I do,

16:06.166 --> 16:07.532
I put it in a bowl
like a person,

16:07.534 --> 16:09.233
Not on the table
where it gets stuck

16:09.235 --> 16:10.335
To an important check

16:10.337 --> 16:12.737
That somebody
accuses me of losing.

16:12.739 --> 16:15.006
- Hey, you know, in class,
we were just doing this.

16:15.008 --> 16:16.574
- Why can't you just admit
this is your fault?

16:16.576 --> 16:18.042
- Because I don't
lose things, frank.

16:18.044 --> 16:19.210
I'm organized.

16:19.212 --> 16:20.311
- Not organized.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.180
Insane.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.015
She's got a shoe box labeled

16:24.017 --> 16:26.451
"pieces of string
too small to use."

16:26.453 --> 16:28.619
- That I should tie together
into a noose.

16:28.621 --> 16:30.254
- I got a beam
all picked out!

16:30.256 --> 16:33.691
- Yeah, I got a step stool
for you.

16:33.693 --> 16:35.393
- Wait, wait, just listen
here for a second.

16:35.395 --> 16:36.561
Wait.

16:36.563 --> 16:38.663
So, dad, you think
mom's being unfair?

16:38.665 --> 16:40.565
- That's right.

16:40.567 --> 16:42.667
It's always my fault
when she can't find something.

16:42.669 --> 16:45.536
- Because I work like a dog
to keep this place straight,

16:45.538 --> 16:48.006
And he messes it up
with all his projects.

16:48.008 --> 16:50.508
- Ice cream's a project?

16:50.510 --> 16:52.343
- So, ma, you think
dad's being inconsiderate.

16:52.345 --> 16:55.546
- Have you met your father?

16:55.548 --> 16:57.448
- And what about
your consideration?

16:57.450 --> 16:58.583
Do I ever get any thanks

16:58.585 --> 17:00.251
For all the stuff
I do around here?

17:00.253 --> 17:01.419
- Like what?

17:01.421 --> 17:04.055
What is it you do?

17:04.057 --> 17:06.257
- Well, didn't I fix the thing?

17:06.259 --> 17:08.092
- That's true, ma,
he did.

17:08.094 --> 17:09.694
- So dad's feeling
unappreciated.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.095
- That's right.

17:11.097 --> 17:12.730
- Oh, come on.

17:12.732 --> 17:15.099
I don't appreciate you?

17:15.101 --> 17:16.534
- How do I know?

17:16.536 --> 17:19.737
- Evidently dad isn't hearing
"thank you."

17:19.739 --> 17:23.041
- Oh, he wants "thank you"?

17:23.043 --> 17:25.777
This isn't "thank you"?

17:25.779 --> 17:28.813
- I guess mom's saying
actions speak louder than words.

17:28.815 --> 17:30.214
- That's very good, raymond.

17:30.216 --> 17:31.783
- But sometimes we need
to hear the words.

17:31.785 --> 17:33.284
- Yeah, I need words.

17:33.286 --> 17:35.153
- And I don't need words?

17:40.459 --> 17:43.261
- I'm sorry the check got stuck
to the chubby hubby.

17:46.532 --> 17:48.833
- You never said that before.

17:48.835 --> 17:50.802
- No one's ever
said that before.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.675
- I appreciate you.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.610
- Thanks.

17:59.612 --> 18:00.812
- Holy crap.
It works.

18:00.814 --> 18:02.246
[bell dings]

18:02.248 --> 18:03.581
- Ooh, pot roast's ready.

18:03.583 --> 18:04.749
- Oh, great.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.517
I love your mother's pot roast.

18:06.519 --> 18:09.353
- Oh, I'm gonna get an "a" here.

18:09.355 --> 18:10.621
- Careful, it's hot.

18:10.623 --> 18:12.290
- Mm-mmm.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.125
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

18:14.127 --> 18:15.660
- How is it, chi-chi?

18:15.662 --> 18:16.461
- Mmm.

18:18.697 --> 18:20.498
- Chi-chi like.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.133
[laughter]

18:23.735 --> 18:25.203
- What did you do?

18:28.507 --> 18:30.174
- Debra, you're not
gonna believe this.

18:30.176 --> 18:31.642
- Why did you do this, ally?

18:31.644 --> 18:32.810
This is terrible.

18:32.812 --> 18:33.811
- Oh, great!

18:36.882 --> 18:39.117
- This is michael's giraffe,
and he's crying.

18:39.119 --> 18:40.751
Now, why did you do this?

18:40.753 --> 18:41.752
- 'cause.

18:41.754 --> 18:43.387
- "'cause" is not an answer.

18:43.389 --> 18:45.123
- Active listening.

18:45.125 --> 18:45.723
- Ray, that doesn't work.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.391
- It works.

18:47.393 --> 18:49.227
I just used it on the worst kids
in the neighborhood.

18:49.229 --> 18:50.528
- Would you look at this?

18:50.530 --> 18:51.762
Look at this.
Look what she did.

18:51.764 --> 18:52.563
- Just try it.
Try it.

18:52.565 --> 18:53.831
- Ray!

18:53.833 --> 18:54.866
- You want me to do it?
I'll do it.

18:54.868 --> 18:55.867
- No, no, okay.

18:55.869 --> 18:58.369
I'll do it.

18:58.371 --> 19:00.204
Okay.

19:00.206 --> 19:01.539
Ally, let's talk
about what you did.

19:01.541 --> 19:03.875
- I don't want to talk.

19:03.877 --> 19:05.576
- Are you feeling angry?

19:05.578 --> 19:08.779
- Reflect back.

19:08.781 --> 19:10.381
- You're angry.

19:10.383 --> 19:11.382
- Yes.

19:11.384 --> 19:13.384
- Okay, but it's not okay

19:13.386 --> 19:14.719
To rip up toys
when we're angry.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.420
- Ah-ah-ah, judgmental.

19:20.192 --> 19:21.325
- [sighs]

19:21.327 --> 19:25.730
You are angry because, um...

19:25.732 --> 19:27.732
- Because it used to be
your toy.

19:27.734 --> 19:28.733
- Oh, pff!

19:28.735 --> 19:31.702
- Yes.

19:31.704 --> 19:34.472
I don't like
michael and geoffrey.

19:34.474 --> 19:35.706
- I see.
I see.

19:35.708 --> 19:37.875
You think
that mommy and daddy

19:37.877 --> 19:39.777
Pay too much attention
to michael and geoffrey.

19:39.779 --> 19:41.412
- Ray, okay,
I was handling this.

19:41.414 --> 19:43.447
- They get everything.

19:43.449 --> 19:45.416
- Right, and you're upset

19:45.418 --> 19:47.251
Because we gave them
your old giraffe.

19:47.253 --> 19:49.253
- I still liked it.

19:49.255 --> 19:50.421
- But you weren't
playing with it.

19:50.423 --> 19:52.657
- But that doesn't matter,
though,

19:52.659 --> 19:55.893
Because it was still yours,

19:55.895 --> 19:57.862
And you're mad because
we gave it to michael

19:57.864 --> 19:59.597
Without asking you, right?

19:59.599 --> 20:02.433
- Right.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.202
- Well, uh...

20:04.204 --> 20:05.937
Mommy and daddy made a mistake,

20:05.939 --> 20:07.972
And everybody makes mistakes,
right, mommy?

20:07.974 --> 20:12.510
- Yes, yes, yes.

20:12.512 --> 20:14.512
- You feel better now, ally?

20:14.514 --> 20:16.380
- Yes.
Can I have the giraffe?

20:16.382 --> 20:17.848
- Well, it's broken, honey.

20:17.850 --> 20:19.250
- I know.

20:19.252 --> 20:20.484
I want to try to fix it
for michael.

20:22.788 --> 20:25.523
- Oh-ho.

20:25.525 --> 20:26.757
Here, sweetie.

20:26.759 --> 20:27.625
- Thank you, daddy.

20:32.831 --> 20:33.864
- See what I did there?

20:33.866 --> 20:35.967
- Yeah, yeah.

20:35.969 --> 20:37.435
Can't believe it.

20:37.437 --> 20:38.869
It's pretty amazing.

20:38.871 --> 20:41.706
You did it.

20:41.708 --> 20:43.307
- Anything else need
taking care of

20:43.309 --> 20:46.010
While I'm around here?

20:46.012 --> 20:47.345
- No.

20:47.347 --> 20:48.346
- What?

20:48.348 --> 20:49.947
What's the matter?

20:49.949 --> 20:52.917
- Nothing with you, obviously.

20:52.919 --> 20:53.918
- Don't go by me.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.754
I'm a natural.

20:56.756 --> 20:57.855
Don't worry,
you'll get it.

20:57.857 --> 21:01.592
- Oh, ugh!

21:01.594 --> 21:04.528
Oh, don't act
so proud of yourself.

21:04.530 --> 21:06.964
Listen, if I hadn't dragged you
to that stupid class,

21:06.966 --> 21:10.268
You'd still be standing there
going, "hey, no tv."

21:12.404 --> 21:14.038
- You're feeling inadequate

21:14.040 --> 21:16.307
'cause I mastered it
before you.

21:16.309 --> 21:19.410
- Don't give me
that active listening crap.

21:19.412 --> 21:21.412
Where do you get off
listening to me?

21:24.016 --> 21:25.516
- Never happen again.

21:32.758 --> 21:34.425
- It's chickens eating chickens.

21:34.427 --> 21:35.426
That's why it's funny.

21:35.428 --> 21:37.795
- I...

21:37.797 --> 21:39.030
- Hey, you got any kleenex?

21:39.032 --> 21:40.498
- Don't give him any.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.466
We got five boxes open
over there.

21:42.468 --> 21:43.801
- They're all halfway down.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.770
The tissues don't pop up
anymore.

21:45.772 --> 21:47.505
You reach in,
your hand gets stuck in the box.

21:47.507 --> 21:49.540
- Your hand gets stuck
in the box

21:49.542 --> 21:51.642
Because you shove it in
like an animal.

21:51.644 --> 21:52.843
- Watch this.

21:52.845 --> 21:55.079
So, ma, you think
dad's being wasteful,

21:55.081 --> 21:56.914
And, dad, you think
mom's being unreasonable.

21:56.916 --> 21:57.715
- And a nag.

22:00.018 --> 22:02.320
- A nag?

22:02.322 --> 22:05.456
Oh, you bitter, miserable man.

22:05.458 --> 22:06.924
- Why do you think that is?

22:06.926 --> 22:08.693
Why do you think
that is, marie?

22:10.762 --> 22:12.063
- I'm sleeping here tonight.

22:12.065 --> 22:13.064
- Good!

22:15.634 --> 22:17.435
[door slams]

22:17.437 --> 22:19.837
- Nice job, professor.

22:19.839 --> 22:21.505
- No tv!
