I'm losing my audience
to a bunch of dead trees!

17:35.000 --> 17:36.291
SPIRAL:
What are you doing here?

17:36.291 --> 17:38.458
I'm setting the X-Men free.

17:39.583 --> 17:42.000
So they can get out
of my time slot.

17:53.083 --> 17:57.708
Hey, hey, hey!
You make them into stars

17:58.208 --> 18:00.958
and they just turn on you.

18:00.958 --> 18:02.333
No!

18:02.333 --> 18:04.875
How about giving me a lift,
Rogue?

18:04.875 --> 18:06.583
ROGUE: Any time, sugar.

18:06.583 --> 18:09.833
Hold it!

18:09.833 --> 18:12.458
This, if you haven't been
paying attention,

18:12.458 --> 18:14.166
is my dimension!

18:14.166 --> 18:19.000
Get with the program
or get crushed!

18:19.000 --> 18:20.958
(SCREAMS)

18:23.083 --> 18:25.000
(CROWD CHEERING)

18:37.458 --> 18:38.833
(GROANS)

18:47.625 --> 18:50.083
Can someone please tell me
what just happened?

18:57.458 --> 19:00.375
DOMO: Everything that
Mojo created is gone.

19:01.458 --> 19:03.458
Especially the audience.

19:03.458 --> 19:07.833
Well, nothing lasts forever,
especially in television.

19:07.833 --> 19:11.458
Did I tell you I used to go out
with an actress with two heads?

19:11.458 --> 19:15.125
-Yeah? Was she nice?
-LONGSHOT: Yes and no.

19:19.125 --> 19:20.500
Bubula!

19:20.958 --> 19:23.708
Come here. Come here, yeah.

19:23.708 --> 19:24.833
(KISSING)

19:25.875 --> 19:28.500
You look great. Lost weight?
Had the face-lift? Whatever.

19:28.500 --> 19:32.750
Listen, it's time we did
a fresh start, you know.

19:32.750 --> 19:34.416
Now, we did
a little re-think on

19:34.416 --> 19:36.291
that re-write for
a re-group on a re-draft.

19:36.291 --> 19:40.583
No, I'm talking new show,
new time slot, new dimension,

19:40.583 --> 19:44.166
bigger hair, less money.
The whole nine yards!

19:45.291 --> 19:47.000
(MOJO LAUGHING)

19:47.750 --> 19:49.000
Ooh!

19:49.000 --> 19:53.000
Look! A jungle picture!

19:53.875 --> 19:55.166
(SCREECHING)

20:00.166 --> 20:02.375
XAVIER: That must be your
Citadel.

20:02.375 --> 20:06.750
Yes, when I built it,
I felt I was creating a new
world here.

20:06.750 --> 20:08.166
(WOMAN SCREAMING)

20:13.750 --> 20:16.000
Magneto, we must help her!

20:18.000 --> 20:19.208
(GROANING)

20:20.000 --> 20:21.416
No, Charles!

20:23.458 --> 20:26.375
The creature attacking
the woman is Sauron.

20:26.375 --> 20:29.208
His powers would make him
a dangerous foe,

20:29.208 --> 20:31.208
even if we still had our own.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.583
There is nothing we can do.
