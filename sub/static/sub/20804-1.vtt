- Faster, go faster!
- That's as fast as I can go.

01:01.171 --> 01:03.881
- Slower, slower!
- Fast or slow'? Make your mind up.

01:03.882 --> 01:06.056
Oh. No, not there. No!

01:06.259 --> 01:07.676
Oh, sorry.
I didn't mean to put it in there.

01:07.677 --> 01:09.888
They're so close together, aren't they'?

01:10.180 --> 01:11.472
Just lay down on your back.
On your back.

01:11.473 --> 01:13.516
Okay.

01:16.770 --> 01:18.604
I'm gonna blow me beans!

01:18.605 --> 01:21.575
Wahey!

01:24.319 --> 01:29.460
Thanks for letting me
seagull your beautiful bangers.

01:31.535 --> 01:36.378
The icing on the cookie. It was lovely.

01:40.919 --> 01:42.170
Keith?

01:42.171 --> 01:44.130
Yeah'?

01:44.131 --> 01:47.467
I just want you to know
that I'm not with you

01:47.468 --> 01:52.055
because you're a disgustingly rich,
successful businessman,

01:52.056 --> 01:54.098
or devastatingly handsome...

01:54.099 --> 01:55.475
Yeah, I know.

01:55.476 --> 01:56.935
It's 'cause I've got
a nice personality, haven't I'?

01:56.936 --> 01:59.020
But me handsomeness
is a faculty though, innit?

01:59.021 --> 02:01.147
Ooh, yeah. I mean, of
course, it's a faculty.

02:01.148 --> 02:04.109
You know, my knees tremble with lust
whenever I come near you.

02:04.110 --> 02:06.319
Do they'?

02:06.320 --> 02:10.115
You're the kind of hunky sex god
I've been looking for all my life,

02:10.116 --> 02:11.575
the man I always hoped I'd marry.

02:11.576 --> 02:13.999
- Honestly'?
- Well...

02:14.120 --> 02:15.704
- Not really.
- Eh?

02:15.705 --> 02:18.290
Everything I'm saying is coming out
of your dirty little mind.

02:18.291 --> 02:21.209
You don't honestly think I'd let you
seagull my bangers in real life, do you'?

02:21.210 --> 02:23.587
- Yeah.
- This is a dream.

02:23.588 --> 02:25.464
Your girlfriend is stood there watching us.

02:25.465 --> 02:27.883
- Hiya, Keith.
- Rosie!

02:27.884 --> 02:30.010
Oh, it's fine, I don't mind you
sea-gulling Kelly Brook's bangers.

02:30.011 --> 02:31.803
She's one of your "would if you could"
top-three celebrities.

02:31.804 --> 02:33.305
- Plus, you're never gonna meet her.
- She's right.

02:33.306 --> 02:34.723
You're never gonna meet me.

02:34.724 --> 02:36.725
She's right, you know'?
You're never gonna meet her.

02:36.726 --> 02:38.936
This is all just a dream.

02:38.937 --> 02:41.688
UK garage sensation Craig David,

02:41.689 --> 02:45.703
get out of my dream!

03:10.093 --> 03:11.427
Hello'?

03:11.428 --> 03:15.014
- Hiya, Keith. It's Rosie.
- Hello?

03:15.015 --> 03:17.517
- I can't <i>hear</i> you.
-  Keith'? It's Rosie.

03:17.518 --> 03:20.603
<i>- I haven't got me thing in.
- Keith, what are you doing?</i>

03:20.604 --> 03:22.980
<i>- Just sticking me thing in.
-  What are you putting in?</i>

03:22.981 --> 03:24.565
Right, the thing's in. Hello, who is it'?

03:24.566 --> 03:26.484
It's Rosie.

03:26.485 --> 03:30.446
Rosie, it's Keith.
I was just dreaming about you.

03:30.447 --> 03:32.824
Aw... Was it a romantic dream'?

03:32.825 --> 03:35.493
Yeah, I sea-gulled all over your bangers.

03:35.494 --> 03:37.370
Aw...

03:37.371 --> 03:39.759
- I love you.
- Yeah, <i>I</i> know.

03:41.459 --> 03:43.501
Say it then.

03:43.502 --> 03:46.129
I do you, too.

03:46.130 --> 03:47.422
I miss ya.

03:47.423 --> 03:49.382
I'm comin' back tomorrow.

03:49.383 --> 03:56.066
And, anyway, Rosie, who else can make
a mashed potato sandwich like you'?

03:56.599 --> 03:58.691
Is it nice?

04:00.770 --> 04:03.271
I'm having it
for me breakfast now.

04:03.272 --> 04:06.233
<i>It's the best mashed potato sandwich
I ever had in me life.</i>

04:06.234 --> 04:11.113
Listen, I've got to be down here for
t'lnvention Convention thing, haven't I'?

04:11.114 --> 04:13.740
It's gonna take Securipole
to a higher plateau.

04:13.741 --> 04:16.827
This time, Rosie, it's
the big time this time.

04:16.827 --> 04:20.296
- So what time do you have to be there'?
- 9:00.

04:21.750 --> 04:24.137
And what time is it now?

04:24.794 --> 04:26.211
It's 10:00.

04:26.212 --> 04:27.338
Ass fucked!

04:27.339 --> 04:31.222
I'm, oh, so very late!

05:02.041 --> 05:04.797
Bang tidy...

05:13.844 --> 05:16.481
Fit.

05:19.183 --> 05:22.936
Okay, the reason that I've organised
this corporate dinner tonight

05:22.937 --> 05:26.940
is to tell you both that,
in two and a half days from now,

05:26.941 --> 05:28.900
I'm going to t'Big Apple.

05:28.901 --> 05:30.735
New York?

05:30.736 --> 05:34.205
No, other Big Apple, London.

05:35.742 --> 05:38.744
It's time to take Securipole global.

05:38.745 --> 05:44.087
America, Australia, maybe even Torquay.

05:47.378 --> 05:51.256
Why d'you want to go to London now
when we've only just set up'?

05:51.257 --> 05:54.051
Don't you think we should try
and sell some poles around here first,

05:54.052 --> 05:56.261
and then, you know, expand slowly'?

05:56.262 --> 05:59.515
Rosie, the only thing
that's gonna be expanding slowly

05:59.516 --> 06:02.685
is my big, fat tallywacker in your mouth

06:02.686 --> 06:06.106
when we're making sweet love.

06:10.944 --> 06:12.611
I always wanted to go to that London,

06:12.612 --> 06:15.114
but me dad said it was likely
that I'd get stabbed.

06:15.115 --> 06:16.407
No, that's not likely.

06:16.408 --> 06:18.451
- Or bummed.
- That won't happen.

06:18.452 --> 06:21.037
Or bummed and stabbed.

06:21.038 --> 06:24.043
- By a terrorist.
- That might happen.

06:27.419 --> 06:30.296
And, Douglas, whilst I'm away,
look after Rosie,

06:30.297 --> 06:34.394
I'm making you the main man.
You're gonna be me.

06:38.430 --> 06:41.724
Rosie, don't you worry.
Whilst I'm down that London,

06:41.725 --> 06:47.198
I won't look at another bird,
no matter how FAF they are.

06:48.149 --> 06:50.192
"FAF"?

06:50.526 --> 06:53.069
<i>Fit as Fuck.</i>

06:53.070 --> 06:56.698
I would go balls deep on that.

06:56.699 --> 06:58.867
- Phwoar!
- Hang out the back of that.

06:58.868 --> 07:03.047
<i>Order. Would the right honourable
gentlemen please calm down?</i>

07:06.542 --> 07:08.716
Taxi!

07:22.433 --> 07:23.559
Oi!

07:23.560 --> 07:26.270
Thanks very much for letting me
share your London black cab.

07:26.271 --> 07:27.437
It's okay.

07:27.438 --> 07:30.107
I've got to say, you're
my favourite Spice Girl.

07:30.108 --> 07:32.735
Aw, I bet you say that
to all the Spice Girls, don't you'?

07:32.736 --> 07:34.737
No, I don't. I've never
met any Spice Girls.

07:34.738 --> 07:35.988
Oh.

07:35.989 --> 07:37.197
Uh... This is me.

07:37.198 --> 07:39.366
Oh, don't you pay. I'll get this.
Don't worry about that.

07:39.367 --> 07:41.327
It's not every day you meet
your favourite Spice Girl, is it'?

07:41.328 --> 07:43.078
Okay, thanks. Cheers.

07:43.079 --> 07:45.290
- Ta-ta.
- Bye.

07:48.084 --> 07:50.252
South Bank, please. Oh!

07:50.253 --> 07:51.587
Sorry. I thought the cab was free.

07:51.588 --> 07:52.963
No worries.

07:52.964 --> 07:56.550
I've got to say, you're
my favourite Spice Girl.

07:56.551 --> 07:58.427
I bet you say that to all the Spice Girls.

07:58.428 --> 07:59.762
No, I've never met any Spice Girls.

07:59.763 --> 08:01.055
Well, I have, I've just met the Baby one.

08:01.056 --> 08:04.308
- Nice. Emma.
- Yeah, Emma Bunt-on.

08:04.309 --> 08:06.769
So let me tell you a bit about myself.
I sell Securipoles.

08:06.770 --> 08:09.355
And tell you what, 'cause
you're a Spice Girl,

08:09.356 --> 08:11.858
I could do you a good deal,
I could stick one in your front passage,

08:11.859 --> 08:13.568
or I could stick one in your back passage.

08:13.569 --> 08:14.944
It's up to you.

08:14.945 --> 08:17.030
Oh, do you know what'?
I think this is where I get out,

08:17.031 --> 08:19.115
- but it was so lovely to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

08:19.116 --> 08:20.408
Yeah'? Good luck in London and everything.

08:20.409 --> 08:21.534
Thanks.

08:21.535 --> 08:24.704
- Good luck with what you're doing. Bye.
- Bye.

08:24.705 --> 08:28.884
Taxi! Hold up!

08:29.418 --> 08:34.255
Come on, then, tell me
I'm your favourite Spice Girl.

08:34.256 --> 08:35.924
You're my favourite Spice Girl.

08:35.924 --> 08:40.971
- Thanks, I'll run from here. Cheers!
- Stingy bastard!

08:40.972 --> 08:43.597
- Oh my days! Simon Pegg.
- Gary Barlow.

08:43.599 --> 08:46.476
- Oh, from Boyzone'?
- You're thinking of Ronan Keating.

08:46.477 --> 08:48.311
No, I was thinking of Simon Pegg.

08:48.312 --> 08:50.230
Hey, I wouldn't go in there.
It's Scary Spice.

08:50.231 --> 08:51.523
She's scratching her grapes and everything.

08:51.524 --> 08:52.899
It's terrible. It stinks.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.318
Can you smell that'?

08:54.319 --> 08:56.236
Me minge is kicking out a reet pong!

08:56.237 --> 08:57.779
Fuckin' hell.

08:57.780 --> 08:59.781
Oh, you're a prude,
Barlow, you are.

08:59.782 --> 09:01.957
You're a fuckin' prude.

09:03.786 --> 09:07.247
<i>Here I am,
at the Invention Convention in London,</i>

09:07.248 --> 09:10.167
<i>where the world's best

09:14.714 --> 09:19.309
<i>As the slogan suggests,

09:20.512 --> 09:23.597
Excuse me, can you tell me where
the Convention Invention is, please?

09:23.598 --> 09:25.939
Over there, mate.

09:26.685 --> 09:29.770
<i>Welcome to the Invention Convention.</i>

09:29.771 --> 09:33.026
Of course it is. Okay.

09:34.276 --> 09:35.651
Let's do this.

09:35.652 --> 09:38.704
Please keep off the grass.

09:51.627 --> 09:53.044
So, it removes your nasal hairs,

09:53.045 --> 09:55.129
but would it remove
the hairs from your testicles?

09:55.130 --> 09:58.978
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the Waterbot.

09:59.969 --> 10:02.357
<i>I am Waterbot.</i>

right here to the present time,

11:01.865 --> 11:06.619

who would like a free consultation
without any obligation

11:42.907 --> 11:45.627

11:45.910 --> 11:47.327
Anyone'?

11:47.328 --> 11:49.788
- Yes, sir, would you like a brochure?
- No.

11:49.789 --> 11:54.170
Some bumph, pamphlets'? No'? Okay.
Have a nice day.

11:57.797 --> 11:59.714
Oh, no.

11:59.715 --> 12:02.092
I like it!

12:02.093 --> 12:05.262
I like it big-time.

12:05.263 --> 12:08.932

Well, Kushvinder, nice to meet you.
My name's Keith.

12:16.524 --> 12:20.028
50, um, what's your business'?
What you shifting?

12:21.696 --> 12:23.530
What, is it a secret?

12:23.531 --> 12:27.201
I have taken the buttons
from a mobile phone device

12:27.202 --> 12:31.049
and replaced them with no buttons.

12:32.332 --> 12:33.707
My friend,

12:33.708 --> 12:36.502
I give you the world's first.

12:36.503 --> 12:40.714
Touchy, Screeny,
Phone Invention Type Invention,

12:40.715 --> 12:43.008
it's called the Tisipiti.

12:43.009 --> 12:44.593
Titistipi?

12:44.594 --> 12:45.886
Tisipiti.

12:45.887 --> 12:48.556
Tisipisti'? Pisitist'?
It's called Pisitist'?

12:48.557 --> 12:50.975
Sisipis'? Pisipis'?

12:50.976 --> 12:52.602
Tisipiti.

12:52.603 --> 12:54.478
I can't read Spanish.
What does it say'? Tistipi...

12:54.479 --> 12:55.730
Tisipiti.

12:55.731 --> 12:58.107
Piss on titties'?

12:58.108 --> 13:00.401
This is my problem!

13:00.402 --> 13:04.530
The device is revolutionary,
but name of it is shit.

13:04.531 --> 13:05.865
It's a bit shit.

13:05.866 --> 13:10.912
Nobody wants to buy a bloody phone
with no buttons with a shit name.

13:10.913 --> 13:14.761
This bloody... This phone.

13:14.917 --> 13:16.292
What are you doing?

13:16.293 --> 13:19.379
This phone is curse of my life.

13:19.380 --> 13:22.173
However, as far as I am concerned,

13:22.174 --> 13:27.220
I have never seen the public
presentation as captivating as yours.

13:27.221 --> 13:28.638
Oh, thanks.

13:28.639 --> 13:32.100
And the cavalier attitude
was sound as a pound.

13:32.101 --> 13:35.437
So, my friend, please, please, I beg you,

13:35.438 --> 13:38.277
take the phone and do what you will.

13:38.900 --> 13:42.819
You can give me 8.2% gross corridor
if you make any money.

13:42.820 --> 13:45.072
But I'm giving up on this product.

13:45.073 --> 13:47.115
So, it's all yours, Keith.

13:47.116 --> 13:49.243
What do you say'?

13:49.244 --> 13:50.869
Well, I've got me own business,
haven't I'? Secur...

13:50.870 --> 13:52.496
What do you say'?

13:52.497 --> 13:56.131
- You can't just give all your...
- What do you say'?

13:58.336 --> 14:00.428
Okay.

14:01.548 --> 14:03.215
Ah. I feel free.

14:03.216 --> 14:05.509
How do you turn it on then?

14:05.510 --> 14:10.188
<i>Attention, this is
an announcement for all exhibitors.</i>

14:10.557 --> 14:15.269
<i>Please pack up your inventions.
The show is over.</i>

14:15.270 --> 14:17.658
You're telling me.

14:28.116 --> 14:30.753
Going global.

14:35.290 --> 14:37.792
<i>♪ Why you being a dickhead for?</i>

14:37.793 --> 14:41.004
<i>♪ You're just fucking up situations</i>

14:41.005 --> 14:43.673
<i>♪ Why you being a dickhead for?</i>

14:43.674 --> 14:46.893
<i>♪ Stop being a dickhead ♪</i>

14:51.182 --> 14:53.266
I wish Rosie was here.

14:53.267 --> 14:56.070
She'd know what to do.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.438
Well, I told ya.

14:58.439 --> 15:01.149
You should try and sell
some poles in Leeds first,

15:01.150 --> 15:02.692
expand the business slowly.

15:02.693 --> 15:05.070
It's not gonna just
happen overnight, Keith.

15:05.071 --> 15:08.406
Rosie, I need some TLC.

15:08.407 --> 15:10.158
Some Tender Lemon Cuddles.

15:10.159 --> 15:12.286
Come here.

15:13.371 --> 15:16.376
- I miss you.
- I miss you.

15:23.589 --> 15:26.341
Will you nosh me off'?

15:26.342 --> 15:27.843
It's cold out, will you be quick'?

15:27.844 --> 15:31.096
I'll be really quick
and it'll make me feel much better.

15:31.097 --> 15:34.433
- Okay.
- Thanks.

15:34.434 --> 15:37.478
Just put that in your mouth there.
Yeah, there you go.

15:37.479 --> 15:38.771
Ooh.

15:38.772 --> 15:40.898
Oh. Use some tongue. Yeah.

15:40.899 --> 15:44.070
Just manoeuvre your head. Move around.

15:49.366 --> 15:52.201
I'll tell you what, let's lay down.

15:52.202 --> 15:54.792
You be on top.

15:57.749 --> 16:00.968
Ah! You sat on me balls, sat on me balls.

16:01.837 --> 16:03.921
Nice, exhilarating.

16:03.922 --> 16:07.341
Turn around. Let's do it from behind.

16:07.342 --> 16:11.179
Just feel your breasts.

16:11.180 --> 16:13.598
Like a monkey.

16:13.599 --> 16:15.433
Dribbling like a fried egg sandwich.

16:15.434 --> 16:17.435
Dirty, bloody Londoner.

16:17.436 --> 16:20.229
Come on, Mother, we're going home.

16:20.230 --> 16:22.654
Jesus!

16:23.317 --> 16:26.778
I'm going crazy. Must be t'stress.

16:26.779 --> 16:30.958
What's she gonna say when she finds out
I've ordered a thousand poles'?

16:31.867 --> 16:36.121
If it was a thousand,
and not two and a 'alf thousand.

16:36.122 --> 16:41.084
I'm totally screwed if it's
two and a 'alf thousand.

16:41.085 --> 16:43.259
One million poles'?

16:43.296 --> 16:44.671
There must've been a
mistake with the order.

16:44.672 --> 16:46.756
We clearly haven't ordered a million poles.

16:46.757 --> 16:50.469
Well, a Mr Keith Lemon
ordered them, apparently.

16:50.470 --> 16:52.644
- Who from'?
- Uh...

16:52.847 --> 16:56.308
- E. Steve Incorporated.
- Who's E. Steve?

16:56.309 --> 17:01.188
Evil Steve. He is an evil bastard.

17:01.189 --> 17:03.899
You know Hood-less Harry, don't you'?
He had a plumbing business.

17:03.900 --> 17:06.652
He couldn't make the payments
on 100 U-bends he'd ordered.

17:06.653 --> 17:09.238
Not a million like what's going on here,

17:09.239 --> 17:11.573
a mere hundred.

17:11.574 --> 17:15.588
Well, when he couldn't pay up,
he had to pay in skin.

17:17.539 --> 17:19.915
Skin?

17:19.915 --> 17:22.589
Aye, foreskin.

17:34.473 --> 17:36.600
Hello.

17:37.351 --> 17:40.144
I gotta say, our Gary,
thanks for coming down to see us.

17:40.145 --> 17:41.312
Not a problem.

17:41.313 --> 17:44.148
I said I'd take me mum
to see Cliff Richards at Madame Tussauds.

17:44.149 --> 17:45.775
Oh, aye. Did it look like him'?

17:45.776 --> 17:47.944
- No. Melted him down, turned him into...
-  ...Beyoncé!

17:47.945 --> 17:51.531
I don't know why I came to London,
I've not sold one Securipole.

17:51.532 --> 17:54.158
The only thing you'll sell down here,
Keith, is your soul.

17:54.159 --> 17:55.827
And you'll end up in the shit.

17:55.828 --> 17:59.789
Yeah, it's all gone tits up. Not you, love.
You can keep 'em where they are.

17:59.790 --> 18:02.917
I don't even know why you wanna move
to London in the first place for anyhow.

18:02.918 --> 18:05.003
They can't even understand us.
You can't even order a drink.

18:05.004 --> 18:06.212
Go on. Go and try.

18:06.213 --> 18:08.548
Excuse me, can I have a Coke, please?

18:08.549 --> 18:10.008
Did you just call me a cock'?

18:10.009 --> 18:12.177
No, I said, can I have a glass of Coke'?

18:12.178 --> 18:15.230
You want me to put my arse on your cock'?

18:15.264 --> 18:17.015
Fuck off, you ginger twat.

18:17.016 --> 18:19.684
It's strawberry blond.
I'm strawberry blond, aren't I'?

18:19.685 --> 18:22.229
Let me give you a bit of advice
that my dad gave to me

18:22.230 --> 18:24.648
just before he went off to join the circus.

18:24.649 --> 18:27.239
He said, "Never..."

18:31.072 --> 18:33.164
Yeah.

18:35.618 --> 18:38.287
"...animals or any other
kind or livestock."

18:38.288 --> 18:39.454
Fair do's.

18:39.455 --> 18:41.707
If it works out well,
I'll be right behind you.

18:41.708 --> 18:46.338
But if you change,
I'll let you know you've changed.

18:49.924 --> 18:51.967
All right, Mom.

18:51.968 --> 18:55.220
Let's go and have a look
at this fucking London Eye.

18:55.221 --> 18:57.890
- Ta-ra, Auntie Fanny.
- Ta-ra, our Keith.

18:57.891 --> 19:01.268
I can't believe that's her real name.
It's American for "arse."

19:01.269 --> 19:02.770
Well, I'm gonna need a signature.

19:02.771 --> 19:05.361
Only an idiot would sign that.

19:07.776 --> 19:10.111
I'll sign it for ya.

19:10.112 --> 19:13.739
- What are you dressed as'?
- Keith Lemon. The main man.

19:13.740 --> 19:17.458
As instructed by the actual main man,
Keith Lemon.

19:18.120 --> 19:22.252
Can I just say, Rosie,
that you look bang tidy. Ooosh!

19:23.208 --> 19:25.382
Why's my pen not working'?

19:26.712 --> 19:28.588
It tastes of piss and all.

19:28.589 --> 19:29.922
That's not a pen.

19:29.923 --> 19:31.841
No, it's a pregnancy test.

19:31.842 --> 19:34.427
Ho-ho! And it's positive.

19:34.428 --> 19:36.846
Congratulations, you make a lovely couple.

19:36.847 --> 19:38.973
- Well done, Keith.
- Thank you.

19:38.974 --> 19:41.309
We're not a couple. That's not Keith Lemon.

19:41.310 --> 19:42.769
I'm Douglas.

19:42.770 --> 19:45.277
Douglas Orange.

19:47.942 --> 19:49.359
Hello'?

19:49.360 --> 19:51.736
Hiya, it's Rosie. How's things?

19:51.737 --> 19:53.905
<i>What is it, Rosie? Is everything okay?</i>

19:53.906 --> 19:56.825
Um... We've got a bit of a problem.

19:56.826 --> 19:59.703
What's up, Rosie? A distinct stress
in your voice, what's the matter?

19:59.704 --> 20:02.330
Have you ordered some, um...
Some poles'?

20:02.331 --> 20:04.499
Yeah, I did, I ordered a thousand.

20:04.500 --> 20:05.667
Good job I did, as well,

20:05.668 --> 20:08.389
'cause I've already surpassed
my pre-sale expectations.

20:08.463 --> 20:11.931
- How many noughts in a thousand, Keith'?
<i>- Huh?</i>

20:12.091 --> 20:13.800
- How many, Keith'?
- Uh...

20:13.801 --> 20:17.387
A few of those circular buggers. Um, six'?

20:17.430 --> 20:18.931
Six noughts is a million!

20:18.932 --> 20:22.851
You've ordered a million Securipoles
from Evil Steve.

20:22.852 --> 20:24.937
Rosie, don't worry
because Evil Steve isn't that evil.

20:24.938 --> 20:26.772
He's friends with Fairdo's Mick
and Nice Tariq.

20:26.773 --> 20:29.525
"Fairdo's Mick"? "Nice Tariq"?
Who are these people'?

20:29.526 --> 20:31.819
Why are you doing business with weirdoes'?

20:31.820 --> 20:33.112
Hey, they aren't weird.

20:33.113 --> 20:34.655
You wanna worry about Weird Paul.

20:34.656 --> 20:37.283
He's got a minge and a penis.
You don't know where you stand with him.

20:37.284 --> 20:38.659
Keith, this is serious.

20:38.660 --> 20:40.786
On a happier note, Keith,
Rosie is pregnant.

20:40.787 --> 20:43.789
- You're gonna be a daddy.
-  Dougie, that's private!

20:43.790 --> 20:45.882
Daddy'?

20:46.418 --> 20:48.972
All right, give us your
fucking money, bruv.

20:50.297 --> 20:52.715
Excuse me, what did you say'?
Sorry, I was on t'phone.

20:52.716 --> 20:58.556
I said, "Give me your fucking money, bruv."

21:00.015 --> 21:02.486
Listen, guys.

21:03.560 --> 21:05.520
You don't want to do this.

21:05.521 --> 21:08.064
I know about your troubles and strifes.

21:08.065 --> 21:09.273
Yeah'?

21:09.274 --> 21:13.861
Wagwan, bredbin? Bumbinsquat and ting.

21:13.862 --> 21:14.988
I'm one of yours.

21:14.989 --> 21:16.865
- One of us'?
- Yes.

21:16.866 --> 21:19.367
I, too, am biracial.

21:19.368 --> 21:21.494
You'll probably notice that me figmentation

21:21.495 --> 21:23.246
is darker than the average white man.

21:23.247 --> 21:27.130
That's because me mam
had an affair with Billy Ocean.

21:29.003 --> 21:31.004
Who the fuck is Billy Ocean'?

21:31.005 --> 21:32.756
You don't know who Billy Ocean is?

21:32.757 --> 21:35.228
Billy Ocean sang...

21:39.013 --> 21:41.140
Keith?

21:43.392 --> 21:45.567
Keith?

21:45.728 --> 21:47.312
He's singing When The Going Gets Tough.

21:47.313 --> 21:50.440
Keith's dad sang that. It's Billy Ocean.

21:50.441 --> 21:51.692
Billy Ocean'?

21:51.693 --> 21:53.736

22:17.761 --> 22:20.398
- It's me telephone.
- Keith?

22:20.597 --> 22:22.807
The line's gone dead.

22:22.808 --> 22:26.268
Listen, guys, we can do this the easy way,

22:26.269 --> 22:28.521
Or we can do it not the easy way.

22:28.522 --> 22:29.897
That being...

22:29.898 --> 22:31.440
The hard way!

22:31.441 --> 22:33.818
Ooosh!

22:33.819 --> 22:37.784
Come on! I'll kill you down, rasclaats!

22:37.906 --> 22:40.164
Then rasclaat this, man.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.535
Just don't touch me hair,

22:42.536 --> 22:46.086

23:06.352 --> 23:09.439
Yes! Thanks, now bring it down.

23:09.855 --> 23:11.439
Now, bring it back up.

23:11.440 --> 23:13.400
Yes! Thanks for coming.

23:13.401 --> 23:16.903
Okay, I'm here to fill the time until
I come back around from this mugging

23:16.904 --> 23:19.698
by those "yoots" of today.

23:19.699 --> 23:20.907
Oh, listen.

23:20.908 --> 23:22.284
Get his fucking suit, you lot, man.

23:22.285 --> 23:23.660
Shit!

23:23.661 --> 23:27.164
They've taken me clothes, the little bastards.

23:27.165 --> 23:28.373
It's a good suit that, as well,

23:28.374 --> 23:31.793
me mam got me that
from B&HS and C&A and Clockhouse...

23:31.794 --> 23:33.378
Anyway, whilst we're here,

23:33.379 --> 23:34.505
we might as well have a
bit of fun, hadn't we,

23:34.506 --> 23:36.089
so I can connect with you.

23:36.090 --> 23:39.176
Let's see if you can guess
what I'm thinking of right here

23:39.177 --> 23:41.261
in my inner conscience.

23:41.262 --> 23:42.930
It's nice, innit?

23:42.931 --> 23:47.393
Okay, you got an allotted time
and your time starts...

23:47.394 --> 23:49.353
now!

23:49.354 --> 23:51.647
That's it, your time's up.
So, did you get it right'?

23:51.648 --> 23:55.568
That's correct! It was a wall of arses.

23:55.569 --> 23:59.113
There's my favourite, I don't know about you.
I quite like that one as well there.

23:59.114 --> 24:00.406
Wi' t'dimples on t'back.

24:00.407 --> 24:02.658
I like to get me thumbs in
when I'm smashing back doors in.

24:02.659 --> 24:04.744
Okay. Oh, listen.

24:04.745 --> 24:06.746
You got <i>bloody</i> text.

24:06.747 --> 24:09.633
Just getting a text through
on that funny phone thing.

24:09.875 --> 24:11.626
- You got <i>bloody</i> text.
- Well, I better go.

24:11.627 --> 24:13.044
Okay, I was me inner conscience.

24:13.045 --> 24:15.630
If I don't see you through t'week,
I'll see you through t'window.

24:15.631 --> 24:17.465

25:38.131 --> 25:41.300
<i>You have reached your bloody destiny,
isn't it, mate?</i>

25:41.301 --> 25:44.556
<i>We got here in good time, kids.</i>

25:57.651 --> 26:01.581
<i>Now we go upstairs.

26:03.198 --> 26:05.325

26:05.326 --> 26:08.710
<i>Bloody spooky, isn't it, mate?</i>

26:08.746 --> 26:12.878
<i>Don't knock. It's open. Good luck, kid.</i>

26:16.128 --> 26:19.631
Listen, G, if this next
fix doesn't get me back in the club,

26:19.632 --> 26:24.344
then you can cut my dick off
and fuck me in the holiest of all holes.

26:24.345 --> 26:26.721
That's right. I said it.

26:26.722 --> 26:29.015
The asshole.

26:29.767 --> 26:32.772
Take a seat, Mr Lemon.
I'll be with you in a minute.

26:33.187 --> 26:35.480
Clean yourself up.

26:36.023 --> 26:39.526
Yeah, yeah, I know.
The moustache is pretty bad.

26:39.527 --> 26:42.828
Who the hell has a moustache these days'?

26:42.905 --> 26:46.539
See ya, I always wanna be ya.

26:48.912 --> 26:51.668
Okay, back to business.

26:54.709 --> 26:58.557
Hi, I'm Archimedes. I'm The Fixer.

26:59.047 --> 27:01.173
Nice to meet you, Keith.

27:01.174 --> 27:03.425
What's unfolding in this scenario'?

27:03.426 --> 27:07.304
Um, well, like the text
said, I'm The Fixer.

27:07.305 --> 27:09.431
- Fixer?
- Yeah.

27:09.432 --> 27:13.280
I find people who are down and out
and I try to help them.

27:13.645 --> 27:15.688
Now, before we get started,

27:15.689 --> 27:19.026
I just have some preliminary
questions for you.

27:19.151 --> 27:22.612
If you were to describe your situation
in one word, what would that be'?

27:22.613 --> 27:23.738
Oh.

27:23.739 --> 27:29.452
Well, basically, I've always dreamed
of being the next Richard Branston.

27:29.453 --> 27:31.876
You know, Branston Pickles.

27:31.997 --> 27:35.750
I'd like to be a household name
with my product, Securipole,

27:35.751 --> 27:39.712
which I've accidentally pre-ordered
a million of from Evil Steve,

27:39.713 --> 27:42.465
that's because I'm numerically dyslexic.

27:42.466 --> 27:45.301
And, so far, I've not sold one,
so I won't be able to pay him back,

27:45.302 --> 27:47.011
and he's probably gonna
cut me foreskin off.

27:47.012 --> 27:48.555
And I don't even got one,
I had it removed with I was three.

27:48.556 --> 27:49.681
Foreskin.

27:49.682 --> 27:51.516
I'm as smooth as a
dolphin's beak downstairs.

27:51.517 --> 27:52.767
I don't know what else he's gonna cut off.

27:52.768 --> 27:55.186
And also, me girlfriend,
that's not really me girlfriend,

27:55.187 --> 27:57.522
is my girlfriend,
but she ain't really me girlfriend,

27:57.523 --> 27:59.232
but she is me girlfriend, she's pregnant.

27:59.233 --> 28:00.400
Don't know how that's happened

28:00.401 --> 28:01.860
because I swear I pulled
it out at the right time.

28:01.861 --> 28:04.571
And I've got verruca.
And I think that me piles have come back.

28:04.572 --> 28:07.282
It's like a shitake mushroom
hanging out of me asshole.

28:07.283 --> 28:09.826
It's like I've got an ingrown toenail
in me chocolate starfish.

28:09.827 --> 28:12.963
Have a look at that. See there'?

28:14.082 --> 28:16.667
- By it hurts. The pain's excruciating.
- Okay.

28:16.668 --> 28:18.759
Just in one word, Keith.

28:21.381 --> 28:23.591
Fucked!

28:24.676 --> 28:26.718
There's one thing
I don't understand.

28:26.719 --> 28:30.222
If Billy Ocean is Keith's dad,
why isn't he called Keith Ocean'?

28:30.223 --> 28:32.307
Because his name's Lemon.

28:32.308 --> 28:34.893
He took his mother's name after Billy left.

28:34.894 --> 28:36.520
Oh, yeah.

28:36.521 --> 28:37.896
Of course.

28:37.897 --> 28:42.326
And I can see his Caribbeanesque features.

28:42.652 --> 28:44.987
So, is anyone gonna sign for these poles'?

28:44.988 --> 28:46.906
Oh, will you just take them away'?

28:46.907 --> 28:48.616
We've obviously made a mistake
with the order.

28:48.617 --> 28:50.117
Hey!

28:50.118 --> 28:51.368
Don't shoot the messenger.

28:51.369 --> 28:53.371
I'm not the bad man here.

28:53.372 --> 28:55.706
It's Evil Steve.

28:55.707 --> 28:57.750

Who the hell calls them-self Evil Steve?

28:57.751 --> 28:59.585
Excuse me.

28:59.586 --> 29:01.754
Ooh...

29:01.755 --> 29:03.756
You've said his name twice.

29:03.757 --> 29:05.466
I dare you to say it three times.

29:05.467 --> 29:07.301
- Evil Steve.
- No, don't.

29:07.302 --> 29:08.761

it don't look like a normal phone.

37:32.983 --> 37:37.862
Kushvinder! This bloody bastard Lemony
he has stolen your Tisipiti.

37:37.863 --> 37:41.074
Keith didn't steal it.
I gave it to him. Mmm!

37:41.075 --> 37:43.368
<i>That's because</i>
<i>of the touchscreen technology.</i>

37:43.369 --> 37:46.663
This guy is selling it rubbish,
just like you.

37:46.664 --> 37:48.874
Bloody Tisipiti!

37:48.875 --> 37:50.250
I tell you, come up with a great idea

37:50.251 --> 37:53.386
and you give it
a stupid fucking name like Tisipiti.

37:53.755 --> 37:54.963
I don't know why I married you.

37:54.964 --> 37:58.681
Oh, no, I do.
Because it was bloody arranged.

37:59.302 --> 38:04.056
But it's the touchscreen technology
that's really the clincher.

38:04.057 --> 38:05.516
Well, I think that's, uh...

38:05.517 --> 38:08.519
David, drop this twat.
Get back to Kelly Brook.

38:08.520 --> 38:10.521
50, Kelly...

38:10.522 --> 38:13.607
I believe you have a new calendar
coming out this year.

38:13.608 --> 38:15.693
- He's blown it.
- Yes, I do, David.

38:15.694 --> 38:17.611
Does it have all 12 months'?

38:17.612 --> 38:20.239
Yes, David, it does have all 12 months.

38:20.240 --> 38:24.410
Wow! I hate those calendars
with only seven months.

38:24.411 --> 38:28.792
- I know.
- Ridiculous. You're really, really...

38:28.915 --> 38:31.876
<i>Remarket the phone.
Put your name to it.</i>

38:31.877 --> 38:33.210
<i>Give it a new identity.</i>

38:33.211 --> 38:35.171
December issue, are you wearing

38:35.172 --> 38:38.971
one of those skimpy little
sexy Santa outfits?

38:39.217 --> 38:42.104
Actually, David, I'm naked.

38:42.137 --> 38:46.015
And I have two Christmas puddings
covering my...

38:46.016 --> 38:48.357
And it's got a lemon on t'back.

38:48.936 --> 38:51.359
Shit the bed!

38:56.110 --> 38:58.403
So sexy!

38:59.780 --> 39:03.710
That's the best thing I've ever seen.
I want one.

39:08.831 --> 39:12.132
Wait a second!
What do you call this phone'?

39:12.209 --> 39:14.301
Um...

39:14.712 --> 39:19.132
It's called the Lemon Phone.
The Keith Lemon phone.

39:19.133 --> 39:21.593
Of course, Lemon!

39:21.594 --> 39:24.262
Oh, the man's a cunting genius.

39:24.263 --> 39:27.974
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the Lemon Phone.

39:27.975 --> 39:30.399
The Keith Lemon phone.

39:30.728 --> 39:33.021
The Keith Lemon Phone!
The Lemon Phone!

39:33.022 --> 39:35.612
The Keith Lemon Phone! The Lemon Phone!

39:35.942 --> 39:38.819
The Lemon Phone!
The Keith Lemon Phone!

39:38.820 --> 39:41.030
The Lemon Phone!

39:41.072 --> 39:44.409
- Incredible! Oh, God!
- Oh!

39:48.830 --> 39:51.041
Eureka!

39:52.000 --> 39:53.917
- Lemon! Whoo!
- Yeah!

39:53.918 --> 39:56.420
- Yarussky, did you see that'?
- Well done!

39:56.421 --> 39:58.756
- They loved it, didn't they'?
- We're such a great team.

39:58.757 --> 40:00.382
- Thanks, man.
- You're my favourite client.

40:00.383 --> 40:01.800
You are amazing!

40:01.801 --> 40:02.927
Now, all we need to do
is go back to Leeds...

40:02.928 --> 40:04.762
Call me.

40:04.763 --> 40:08.148
- Anytime.
- Son of a... Keith'?

40:08.767 --> 40:10.976
- Hey, Keith'?
- Hello'? Kelly Brook speaking.

40:10.977 --> 40:13.365
Is now a good time'?

40:14.272 --> 40:16.565
Keith!

40:20.028 --> 40:21.237
It's amazing.

40:21.238 --> 40:25.074
<i>The new Lemon Phone
has literally conquered the world.</i>

40:25.075 --> 40:29.996
<i>Small-time Northern English businessman
Keith Lemon has gone from rags to riches</i>

40:29.997 --> 40:33.750
<i>in an overnight success
to top all overnight successes.</i>

40:33.751 --> 40:37.883
<i>But what is it that makes the phone
so desirable?</i>

40:38.172 --> 40:39.923
<i>It's got a lemon on t'back_.</i>

40:39.924 --> 40:42.509
<i>And that makes it good because...</i>

40:42.510 --> 40:44.553
<i>I don't know.</i>

40:44.720 --> 40:48.223
<i>And there you have it,
the answer is they just don't know.</i>

40:48.224 --> 40:49.557
<i>- Lemon on t'back.
- Lemon on t'back.</i>

40:49.558 --> 40:51.935
<i>From New York to India and China
to Barnsley,</i>

40:51.936 --> 40:54.813
<i>the Lemon Phone is a global sensation.</i>

40:54.814 --> 40:58.400
<i>Lemon on t'back. Lemon on t'back.
The lemon has truly landed.</i>

41:06.743 --> 41:08.368
And there you have it.

41:08.369 --> 41:11.204
The sales of the Lemon Phone,
the Keith Lemon phone,

41:11.205 --> 41:13.915
have turned you
into an overnight billionaire.

41:13.916 --> 41:16.803
Rich beyond your wildest dreams.

41:17.295 --> 41:19.588
Excuse me while I finish the paperwork.

41:19.589 --> 41:22.633
Amazing!
This is the best fix I've ever done!

41:22.634 --> 41:25.844
I can't believe it.
I'm literally without belief.

41:25.845 --> 41:28.847
So, now, alls we have to do
is pay for the poles,

41:28.848 --> 41:31.642
get you back to Leeds
to father your unborn love-child,

41:31.643 --> 41:34.103
and live happily ever after with Rosie.

41:34.104 --> 41:37.156
I love it when a fix comes together.

41:37.941 --> 41:39.191
Poles?

41:39.192 --> 41:42.903
Unborn love-child'? Rosie'? Leeds?

41:42.904 --> 41:45.114
What's Leeds? Like computer leads?
What are you talking about'?

41:45.115 --> 41:47.324
It's where you're from, dumb-ass.

41:47.325 --> 41:53.629
Archiminges, sometimes the right thing
isn't always the black and white thing.

41:54.708 --> 41:56.167
But what about the...

41:56.168 --> 41:58.836
So, what are you
going to do with it all, Mr Lemon'?

41:58.837 --> 42:02.632
Well, Spectacle Man, the question
ain't what am I going to do with it all,

42:02.633 --> 42:07.394
the question is what aren't
I not gonna do with it all.

42:07.971 --> 42:10.359
Isn't that great?

42:13.269 --> 42:17.234
Here. Go buy yourself some specs.

42:18.107 --> 42:23.653
I'm rich! I'm rich! I'm rich! I'm rich!

44:53.723 --> 44:58.485
<i>I'd just like to say

44:58.687 --> 45:00.396
What the hell

45:00.397 --> 45:05.318
is Keith Lemon doing on the telly,
acting all Rockefeller

45:05.319 --> 45:07.486
when he hasn't even paid me
for my poles'?

45:07.487 --> 45:13.159
<i>It's also to me for all I've achieved
during this short period of time.</i>

45:13.160 --> 45:15.495
<i>And thanks to Kelly Brook.</i>

45:15.496 --> 45:21.084
<i>I can't wait to have full-on

<i>in your minge hole

45:25.506 --> 45:28.641
<i>So, Kelly, come here.</i>

45:28.842 --> 45:34.681
More importantly, how has a ginger tit
like him pulled Kelly Brook?

45:34.682 --> 45:37.485
He's not ginger, he's strawberry blond.

45:39.228 --> 45:42.447
Strawberry blond, my arse!

45:44.066 --> 45:45.650
HE'S ginger!

45:45.651 --> 45:49.779
And it looks like Kelly Brook
likes a bit of ginger minge, too.

45:49.780 --> 45:52.407
I thought you was his canny bird.

45:52.408 --> 45:54.743
- I am.
- Well, I'll tell you what,

45:54.744 --> 45:56.745
I've got a big gaff here.

45:56.746 --> 46:00.874
It could do with a woman's touch.
Or should I say,

46:00.875 --> 46:04.129
I could do with a woman's touch.

46:04.796 --> 46:07.422
That's funny 'cause I thought
you and Dennis was an item.

46:07.423 --> 46:09.383
What have you been telling her'?

46:09.384 --> 46:11.176
That was just a bit of fun.

46:11.177 --> 46:13.804
We were at polytechnic.
We were experimenting.

46:13.805 --> 46:15.222
Do you and your boyfriend not think

46:15.223 --> 46:18.267
that my boyfriend is not gonna come back
and kick the shit out of you'?

46:18.268 --> 46:20.728
What'? Does he know jujitsu'?

46:20.729 --> 46:25.359
Well, it won't work on us.
'Cause we're Church of England.

46:25.483 --> 46:28.277
- Will we kill her now, boss'?
- No, we won't kill her now.

46:28.278 --> 46:29.653
We'll miss I'm a Celebrity.

46:29.654 --> 46:33.502
You get the vat turned on,
get it all hot and bubbly, like.

46:33.575 --> 46:34.700
We'll watch a bit of telly,

46:34.701 --> 46:37.422
then we'll decide what to do.

46:38.747 --> 46:42.833
Scream! I said scream!

46:42.834 --> 46:45.378
I wanna hear you scream!

46:45.379 --> 46:46.545
In your dreams!

46:46.546 --> 46:49.882
- Dennis, shall we get some ice cream?
- Yeah, what's your favourite'?

46:49.883 --> 46:51.509
Rum and raisin.

46:51.510 --> 46:54.637
I'll let you smear it all over me
knackers and let you lick it off.

46:54.638 --> 46:56.222
I'm jokin'!

46:56.223 --> 46:59.017
You've got to put those
polytechnic days behind you, man.

46:59.018 --> 47:02.319
Honestly! You tit!

47:06.483 --> 47:12.030
One billion and a half and one,
one billion and a half and two,

47:12.031 --> 47:16.958
one billion and a half and three.
Can you go faster with that fan'?

47:17.328 --> 47:19.204
Don't you think you
should check on Rosie

47:19.205 --> 47:20.372
rather than counting your money'?

47:20.373 --> 47:23.541
You seem to have forgotten
about all your problems back in Leeds.

47:23.542 --> 47:27.212
This is nothing but bad karma, Keith.
Bad, bad karma.

47:27.213 --> 47:31.925
Archi-cock-blocker, I am calmer.
I'm as calm as a cucumber, unlike you.

47:31.926 --> 47:35.429
All you've done is complain
since I've been an overnight success.

47:35.430 --> 47:38.181
Which is perplexing, really,
as it were you who fixed it all up.

47:38.182 --> 47:41.435
Don't remind me.
You know, I made a big mistake, Keith.

47:41.436 --> 47:42.936
The only mistake you made, brother,

47:42.937 --> 47:45.439
is not getting yourself a costume
for tonight's toga party.

47:45.440 --> 47:46.565
Toga party?

47:46.566 --> 47:50.444
And because I'm a nice and kind man,
and remembered...

47:50.445 --> 47:53.113
Here. Put that on.

47:53.114 --> 47:55.199
- This is a napkin.
- It'll be big enough for you.

47:55.200 --> 47:56.658
- But...
- Now excuse me.

47:56.659 --> 47:58.917
I've got a phone call to make.

48:01.331 --> 48:05.167
Hello, is that Yorkshire Bank'?
It's Keith. How much money have I got'?

48:05.168 --> 48:07.920
Don't you see
that all this is too good to be true'?

48:07.921 --> 48:14.427
Archidoodles, if things appear too good
to be true, then they probably are true.

48:14.428 --> 48:18.848
That is the saying.
Now excuse me, I'm on t'phone.

48:18.849 --> 48:20.224
Can you confirm that for me, please?

48:20.225 --> 48:22.852
<i>You are currently
one billion, five hundred million</i>

48:22.853 --> 48:25.988
<i>- and eight pounds in credit.</i>

48:27.357 --> 48:29.692
Kelly Brook. I've just been on t'phone
to Yorkshire Bank.

48:29.693 --> 48:32.361
I've got one billion and a half
and eight pounds.

48:32.362 --> 48:35.365
I thought I had one billion and a half
and three pounds.

48:35.366 --> 48:39.494
I've just made five pounds,
sat in t'hot tub. Ooosh!

48:39.495 --> 48:43.706
Hey, man. You should ditch this broad.
She's nothing but trouble, if you ask me.

48:43.707 --> 48:46.376
Ditch Kelly Brook?
Have you been glue sniffing?

48:46.377 --> 48:50.591
- Wow! That's so much money.
- Yeah, I know.

48:50.631 --> 48:53.550
Here. You can have some.

48:53.551 --> 48:58.608
Go buy yourself a brassiere
or some tampons. Girl things.

48:59.599 --> 49:04.442
Keith, um... Can I have a word with you'?

49:10.568 --> 49:14.700
Archi...
Can we have some privacy, please?

49:15.323 --> 49:16.573
Go on, piss off.

49:16.574 --> 49:19.409
Keith, I know you've been waiting
for this moment.

49:19.410 --> 49:23.293
So have I. I want you
to constipate this relationship.

49:23.373 --> 49:26.750
Well, come and take me.
Just take me now. Take all of me.

49:26.751 --> 49:30.254
I'm sick of this dry-humping.
I wanna feel you.

49:30.255 --> 49:31.630
I want you to touch me in places.

49:31.631 --> 49:33.549
I've never been touched before.

49:33.550 --> 49:36.260
I want you to stick
your fingers in my mouth.

49:36.261 --> 49:38.012
Like Michael Douglas in Basic Instinct.

49:38.013 --> 49:40.514
- Just stick them in it really hard.
- Mmm. Scumbag.

49:40.515 --> 49:43.392
Oh, Keith, I can just
feel you right now.

49:43.393 --> 49:46.562
Just come and smash my back doors in.
Take me, Keith!

49:46.563 --> 49:49.117
- Take me!
- I'm coming!

52:03.828 --> 52:07.080
Hello, my name is Douglas.
I'm going to London.

52:07.081 --> 52:10.086
- Where are you going?
- London.

52:13.254 --> 52:16.798
Hello, my name is Douglas.
I'm going to London.

52:16.799 --> 52:20.267
- Where are you going?
- London.

52:24.682 --> 52:30.072
- Hello, my name is Douglas...
- We're all going to fucking London!

52:31.981 --> 52:35.275
Today's in-coach movie

52:35.276 --> 52:38.820
<i>is the Sylvester Stallone classic,
wait for it...</i>

52:38.821 --> 52:43.784
- Spy Kids 3D <i>in</i> 2D.
-  His worst one.

52:47.664 --> 52:52.126
Um... I'm sorry about what just happened
when I blabbed up all over the place.

52:52.127 --> 52:54.670
That's never happened
to me before ever in me life.

52:54.671 --> 52:59.800
Anyway, as a token of my apology,
I've got you a present.

52:59.801 --> 53:05.061
I'd like to present you
with these two piranhas on plinths.

53:06.558 --> 53:08.434
If you don't like them,
you can take the plinths off

53:08.435 --> 53:10.144
and you can wear them as earrings.

53:10.145 --> 53:12.855
Just bring 'em up to your ears.
Let's see what they look like.

53:12.856 --> 53:15.024
Oh, yes. They look beautiful.

53:15.025 --> 53:17.401
It really brings the colour
out of your breasts... Your eyes.

53:17.402 --> 53:22.490
- Lovely. Do you like 'em'?
- Yeah, they're, um... unique.

53:22.491 --> 53:25.827
Yeah, they're unique, aren't they'?
Piranha fish earrings.

53:25.828 --> 53:27.829
Ever so unique. I like that word.

53:27.830 --> 53:29.580
So that means it's a good thing,
doesn't it'?

53:29.581 --> 53:30.748
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

53:30.749 --> 53:34.127
I love that film, <i>Piranha</i> 3D, me.
I think it's amazing.

53:34.128 --> 53:38.423
Yeah, all the blood and gore and stuff.
That's my kind of film.

53:38.424 --> 53:41.176
You seen Rambo? You've not seen Rambo?

53:41.177 --> 53:43.303
I'll tell you what happens in <i>Rambo</i>
if you've not seen Rambo.

53:43.304 --> 53:45.430
What happens in <i>Rambo</i>
is he tries to get into a small town.

53:45.431 --> 53:46.556
They won't let him into the small town.

53:46.557 --> 53:47.724
So he goes into the small town anyway.

53:47.725 --> 53:49.225
So they arrest him
and take him down to the station,

53:49.226 --> 53:50.435
do his fingerprints, but you can see

53:50.436 --> 53:51.603
he don't want to do his fingerprints.

53:51.604 --> 53:53.230
Then they put him in the shower
and they hose him down,

53:53.231 --> 53:54.356
which I thought was a bit homoerotic.

53:54.357 --> 53:56.233
And then he punches
that ginger guy from CSI: <i>Miami.</i>

53:56.234 --> 53:58.276
Then he breaks out. Then there's
a passerby on the motorbike.

53:58.277 --> 53:59.528
He takes his motorbike from him.

53:59.529 --> 54:01.363
And then he goes into the forest
and he climbs up a tree.

54:01.364 --> 54:03.198
Then he falls out of the tree.
He cuts all his arm up.

54:03.199 --> 54:04.324
But, lucky for him,
he's got a Rambo knife.

54:04.325 --> 54:05.450
It's got loads of trinkets in it.

54:05.451 --> 54:06.576
It's got needle and thread in there.

54:06.577 --> 54:07.703
So he sews up his arm like that

54:07.704 --> 54:09.788
and he goes further into the forest
being chased by the locals.

54:09.789 --> 54:11.456
A bit like Frankenstein.
They've got torches and stuff.

54:11.457 --> 54:12.583
Then he goes into a tunnel.

54:12.584 --> 54:14.459
And we see loads of flashbacks
of when he was in Vietnam.

54:14.460 --> 54:15.586
So we know he's not in trouble.

54:15.587 --> 54:17.004
And then he gets
loads of rats on his back.

54:17.005 --> 54:19.173
And he burns the rats off his back.
Then they blow up the tunnel.

54:19.174 --> 54:21.008
Then he goes out of the tunnel.
Then he goes into the town

54:21.009 --> 54:22.259
that he tried to get into before.

54:22.260 --> 54:24.814
And he meets his old sergeant
and then he says...

54:28.058 --> 54:30.392
You can't tell what he's saying
but you can tell that he says,

54:30.393 --> 54:33.395
"They drew first blood. Not me."

54:33.396 --> 54:37.493
Hence the title of the film,
<i>First</i> Blood.

54:41.113 --> 54:43.906
Hey, I've heard that the sequel
to <i>Marley &</i> Me is coming out as well.

54:43.907 --> 54:46.033
<i>Marley &</i> Me 2.
And that's gonna be in 3D.

54:46.034 --> 54:47.743
If it is in 3D,
that's gonna be summat.

54:47.744 --> 54:49.788
I'll buy a ticket for that, I will.

54:50.831 --> 54:54.167
<i>Keith Lemon, award winning businessman

55:48.848 --> 55:52.352
Keith, what about Rosie'?

55:57.941 --> 56:02.653
Ladies, what we got here is a boiled egg
surrounded by Italian sausage meat

56:02.654 --> 56:07.032
and golden breadcrumb.
In Italy, we call it the Scotch egg.

56:07.033 --> 56:11.462
It's like putting a ship in a bottle.
Touch my balls, touch my balls.

56:11.580 --> 56:14.466
No, I meant really touch my balls.

01:02:28.421 --> 01:02:31.173
Listen, we need to take you
back home to Leeds.

01:02:31.174 --> 01:02:33.342
Evil Steve has kidnapped Rosie.

01:02:33.343 --> 01:02:36.303
And only you can save us
by giving us money for t'poles.

01:02:36.304 --> 01:02:41.642
Listen, firstly,
I know about eleven Douglaseseses.

01:02:41.643 --> 01:02:43.769
And you're not one of them.

01:02:43.770 --> 01:02:47.189
Thirdly, I don't know
anyone called Rosie.

01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:50.609
There's only one woman in my life
and that's Kelly Brook.

01:02:50.610 --> 01:02:53.404
And she loves me
and we fuck like spider monkeys.

01:02:53.405 --> 01:02:57.158
Keith, it's me, Douglas.

01:02:57.159 --> 01:03:00.536
Security! Take this dingbat away.

01:03:00.537 --> 01:03:03.708
If you want money, here.

01:03:03.874 --> 01:03:07.585
Go buy yourself a new suit,
'cause you look low-quality.

01:03:07.586 --> 01:03:10.307
Daft tomato-face!

01:03:10.506 --> 01:03:12.757
You used to be my friend.

01:03:12.758 --> 01:03:16.522
More than that,
you were like my brother!

01:03:16.637 --> 01:03:18.054
Well, not as close as that,

01:03:18.055 --> 01:03:20.056
more like a cousin
that I saw at family occasions

01:03:20.057 --> 01:03:23.017
like Christmas and birthdays
and funerals and stuff.

01:03:23.018 --> 01:03:25.895
Once we celebrated St George's Day,
but we didn't know what it meant.

01:03:25.896 --> 01:03:28.773
- You don't know what St George's Day is?
- I love St George's Day.

01:03:28.774 --> 01:03:31.067
I love St George's Day.
That is my favourite holiday.

01:03:31.068 --> 01:03:33.153
That's my favourite holiday, too.

01:03:33.154 --> 01:03:34.571
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

01:03:34.572 --> 01:03:36.198
I wanna fingerblast you right now.

01:03:36.199 --> 01:03:38.283
Are you listening to me, Keith Lemon'?

01:03:38.284 --> 01:03:44.041
You listen to me.
Will you kindly leave my lavish palace?

01:03:46.125 --> 01:03:52.297
- Go on, get out, you wronghead!
- That's harsh, man. Totally un-PC.

01:03:52.298 --> 01:03:53.966
You can shut up and all.

01:03:53.967 --> 01:03:56.468
There's far worse things
I could've called him.

01:03:56.469 --> 01:03:58.470
Like a stupid spas...

01:03:58.471 --> 01:04:00.978
What did he say'?

01:04:02.892 --> 01:04:06.520
I wasn't gonna say
what you thought I was gonna say.

01:04:06.521 --> 01:04:09.277
'Cause... I was... I was gonna say...

01:04:30.128 --> 01:04:34.012
Which is foreign for, "You silly idiot."

01:04:34.591 --> 01:04:39.898
- Now go on, flip off! Go on, flip off!
- Damn moron.

01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:44.396
Go on, get out of it.

01:04:45.227 --> 01:04:49.897
You used to be the main man.
Now you're not the main anything.

01:04:49.898 --> 01:04:54.194
I, Douglas Orange, am not friends
with Keith Lemon any more.

01:04:54.195 --> 01:04:56.369
Good.

01:05:00.785 --> 01:05:03.256
- And you know what'?
- What?

01:05:03.454 --> 01:05:05.622
- I'm not your fixer any more.
- Oh.

01:05:05.623 --> 01:05:08.041
I'd rather eat shit
than hang out with you.

01:05:08.042 --> 01:05:13.964
Then go eat shit, you shit-eater.
Go get some shit and put it in a pita.

01:05:13.965 --> 01:05:16.306
A shita.

01:05:16.968 --> 01:05:20.649
- Go on. Get out, you dicksplats.
- Piss off!

01:05:21.639 --> 01:05:23.932
- What was that all about'?
- I don't know.

01:05:23.933 --> 01:05:25.475
But I'll tell you what, Kelly Brook.

01:05:25.476 --> 01:05:28.228
I will let you finger my arsehole
as a part of lovemaking.

01:05:28.229 --> 01:05:31.481
And I have never let anyone
stick their finger up my arse.

01:05:31.482 --> 01:05:33.870
Aw!

01:05:34.652 --> 01:05:37.821
I lust you... Love you. Fancy it'?

01:05:37.822 --> 01:05:39.990
- Come on, then.
-  Up there.

01:05:39.991 --> 01:05:43.459
Come on, we're having a party. Party.

01:05:53.964 --> 01:05:56.507
Douglas.

01:05:56.508 --> 01:05:58.884
Who would win in a fight
out of all the Expendables

01:05:58.885 --> 01:06:02.221
<i>in that film, um... The Expendables'?</i>

01:06:02.222 --> 01:06:04.557
Sylvester Stallone, obviously.
He's t'leader.

01:06:04.558 --> 01:06:06.726
- But what about Jason Streatham'?
- Crank.

01:06:06.727 --> 01:06:08.185
- Jet Li'?
- Easy Jet.

01:06:08.186 --> 01:06:10.104
- Mickey Rourke.
- Mickey...

01:06:10.105 --> 01:06:11.814
What about Arnold Schwarzenegger'?

01:06:11.815 --> 01:06:15.745
The only governor
is Sylvester Stallone.

01:06:32.837 --> 01:06:35.806
I've been stitched up.

We got the main funky guy
and the main funky girl!

01:06:55.318 --> 01:06:58.028
It's "K" for Kelly-Lemon!

01:06:58.029 --> 01:07:01.406
Hey, bro, they're doing karaoke.
You gonna have a go'?

01:07:01.407 --> 01:07:02.866
Nah, mate, singing's not for me.

01:07:02.867 --> 01:07:05.125

01:08:22.365 --> 01:08:24.823
Out of the way.
Shift, you. Shift, shift.

01:08:24.825 --> 01:08:26.785
I'll tell you what's wrong
with your mouth, love.

01:08:26.786 --> 01:08:29.412
It's that cheeky little badger's
fault up there.

01:08:29.412 --> 01:08:32.249
Luckily, I still communicate
via fax and pager.

01:08:32.250 --> 01:08:34.341
Sometimes pigeon.

01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:37.002

one of those phones.

Your auntie, Keith.
Your very own flesh and blood.

01:08:41.551 --> 01:08:44.011
And look what it's done to her face.

01:08:44.011 --> 01:08:47.514
- Eurgh! Mingin'!
- Proper fucked.

01:08:47.515 --> 01:08:50.603
And now I'm wracked wi' guilt.

01:08:52.228 --> 01:08:54.313
I'm sorry, Auntie Fanny.

01:08:54.314 --> 01:08:57.066
That's her real name, Fanny.
It's like American for "arse."

01:08:57.067 --> 01:08:59.777
Now you might all think
I'm another relative

01:08:59.778 --> 01:09:02.904
who's come out of the woodwork
because he's doing well for himself.

01:09:02.906 --> 01:09:04.406
But you'd be wrong.

01:09:04.407 --> 01:09:07.493
'Cause I'm here to tell you
the dangers of that phone.

01:09:07.493 --> 01:09:11.162
The Lemon Phone. The Keith Lemon Phone.

01:09:11.163 --> 01:09:14.792
Keep using it, and you'll all end up
with a face like her up there.

01:09:14.792 --> 01:09:15.960
Kelly Brook.

01:09:15.961 --> 01:09:17.877
And don't get me wrong, Kelly, love.

01:09:17.879 --> 01:09:20.464
I used to wank my eyelashes off
over you.

01:09:20.465 --> 01:09:21.674
But not now, Kelly.

01:09:21.675 --> 01:09:26.220
Not now you've got a face
like an old, blistered pisspot.

01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:29.015
My career!
My face, my beautiful face!

01:09:29.015 --> 01:09:33.019
I'm sorry, Kelly.
No likey, you're wonky.

01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:34.937
- I'll never work again.
- It looks nice.

01:09:34.938 --> 01:09:36.564
Just put a bag on your head,
it'll be all right.

01:09:36.564 --> 01:09:39.359
Look at 'em! Look at 'em, Keith.
They're all changing!

01:09:39.359 --> 01:09:40.902
Look at their faces!

01:09:40.903 --> 01:09:43.238
Van Outen! Tiny Strides!

01:09:43.238 --> 01:09:44.697
Oh, for fuck's sake!

01:09:44.698 --> 01:09:46.741
- Moylesie!
- What?

01:09:46.742 --> 01:09:49.536
Holly Willoughbooby, Nostrils!

01:09:49.537 --> 01:09:52.127
Odd-looking fucker blowin' trumpet!

01:09:52.247 --> 01:09:55.709
Gino D'Acampoff.

01:09:55.710 --> 01:09:58.253
Peter Andre and Jason Doneover.

01:09:58.254 --> 01:10:02.007
You're in the shit, Keith, lad.
You're in the shit.

01:10:02.008 --> 01:10:04.929
Let the bell meet the end.

01:10:05.178 --> 01:10:07.850
I'll see you in the sequel.

01:10:08.556 --> 01:10:10.974
I'll never work again.

01:10:10.975 --> 01:10:13.102
Let's get him!

01:10:15.772 --> 01:10:18.409
- Wanker!
- Yes!

01:10:19.359 --> 01:10:20.776
Hey, when you see that Keith Lemon,

01:10:20.777 --> 01:10:23.028
you tell him I'm gonna
kick his frickin' ass.

01:10:23.029 --> 01:10:25.322
My mouth is Hoff-centre.

01:10:25.323 --> 01:10:27.407
<i>Pictures are coming in

01:10:27.408 --> 01:10:31.089
<i>who are now infuriated

01:10:35.709 --> 01:10:38.085
Kushvinder, what the eff is going on'?

01:10:38.086 --> 01:10:41.171
It appears as if they are blaming
your phone for their wonky mouth.

01:10:41.172 --> 01:10:42.506
MY Phone?

01:10:42.507 --> 01:10:44.550
- Didn't you PAT test this'?
- Of course I did.

01:10:44.551 --> 01:10:47.511
Pat tested it and she said
it was bloody brilliant.

01:10:47.512 --> 01:10:50.806
- Isn't that right, Pat'?
- Oh, yes, it's bloody marvellous.

01:10:50.807 --> 01:10:52.933
It's got spirit level,
it's got Sati-nav,

01:10:52.934 --> 01:10:55.227
a melodic selection of ringtones!

01:10:55.228 --> 01:10:56.687
I mean P-A-T.

01:10:56.688 --> 01:11:00.986
Which stands for
"portable appliance testing," you dingbats!

01:11:01.109 --> 01:11:02.235
Time to go home.

01:11:02.236 --> 01:11:05.530
Thanks for the 8.2%
gross corridor cheque.

01:11:05.531 --> 01:11:07.872
How do!

01:11:25.843 --> 01:11:29.144
He's going for the roof.

01:11:33.809 --> 01:11:36.353
Help me! Help me!

01:11:36.354 --> 01:11:39.564
Somebody, help me!
Kelly Brook's gonna kill me now!

01:11:39.565 --> 01:11:42.119
She's gonna cut me knackers off!

01:11:43.194 --> 01:11:45.362
Archi-bee-gees, they're gonna kill me.

01:11:45.363 --> 01:11:48.657
Me dream has turned to shit.
It's a nightmare!

01:11:48.658 --> 01:11:52.588
Look, I came up here
for some peace and quiet. 50 fuck off.

01:11:52.996 --> 01:11:55.080
We're gonna rip
your balls off, Keith Lemon!

01:11:55.081 --> 01:11:57.255
She sounds pretty angry to me.

01:11:57.333 --> 01:11:58.625
Here's Kelly!

01:11:58.626 --> 01:12:02.171
- Looks like you haven't got long, man.
- I'm gonna kill you, Keith Lemon.

01:12:02.172 --> 01:12:06.635
I've ruined everything.
I had me chance and I blowed it.

01:12:06.801 --> 01:12:09.678
There's no other choice
for a self-centred bastard like me.

01:12:09.679 --> 01:12:11.472
- I'm gonna kill meself.
- Just do it.

01:12:11.473 --> 01:12:13.098
I'm gonna throw meself
off this building,

01:12:13.099 --> 01:12:14.934
- which I once owned.
- Bye-bye.

01:12:14.935 --> 01:12:16.644
I'm going to smash me skull
to smithereens.

01:12:16.645 --> 01:12:17.770
I don't give a shit.

01:12:17.771 --> 01:12:20.356
And a fox might come along
and lick me eyeballs clean out!

01:12:20.357 --> 01:12:23.160
<i>- Adiós, amigo.</i>

01:12:26.655 --> 01:12:30.366
I'm sorry, Rosie. I'm sorry, Douglas.

01:12:30.367 --> 01:12:34.713
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

01:12:40.711 --> 01:12:46.350
Rosie, despite my devastatingly
handsome looks and me tallywacker,

01:12:46.675 --> 01:12:52.147
which is as thick as a Coke can,
why are you with me'?

01:12:52.473 --> 01:12:56.237
Well, everyone thinks
they know Keith Lemon,

01:12:56.727 --> 01:13:00.897
this self-obsessed know-it-all
who really don't know anything.

01:13:00.898 --> 01:13:03.233
I do know some things.

01:13:03.234 --> 01:13:05.485
But I know the real Keith Lemon.

01:13:05.486 --> 01:13:11.160
Kind, thoughtful, lovely man
who makes me smile.

01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:17.081
So are you gonna do me white bits, then?

01:13:17.290 --> 01:13:20.758
Leave your white bits. I like 'em.

01:13:21.461 --> 01:13:23.718
Fair do's.

01:13:31.804 --> 01:13:35.265
- What am I doing?
- Killing yourself, man.

01:13:35.266 --> 01:13:38.143
Sylvester Stallone
would never kill himself.

01:13:38.144 --> 01:13:41.730
He'd go back and fight the enemies
and save the day.

01:13:42.565 --> 01:13:47.825
That's what I've gotta do.
I've got to go back and save the day.

01:13:47.946 --> 01:13:51.995
More pacifically, I've gotta save Rosie.

01:13:52.158 --> 01:13:55.923
- The love of me life.
- You are a good guy.

01:13:55.996 --> 01:13:59.546
- I knew it!
- Thanks.

01:14:01.543 --> 01:14:04.295
What's wrong'? What's wrong, Archimedes'?

01:14:04.296 --> 01:14:06.255
Are you having a eptileptic fit?

01:14:06.256 --> 01:14:08.174
I'm gonna fucking kill you, Keith Lemon!

01:14:08.175 --> 01:14:12.188
Is there a doctor on the roof'?
I need a doctor!

01:14:13.847 --> 01:14:19.023
- Shit! It's Kelly Brook.
- There he is, the ginger twat!

01:14:21.522 --> 01:14:24.065
I'm not a ginger twat.
I'm strawberry blond.

01:14:24.066 --> 01:14:26.489
Well, you're still a twat!

01:14:28.737 --> 01:14:30.948
Cheese and rice!

01:15:03.272 --> 01:15:05.857
- You've got wings.
- Hell, yeah!

01:15:05.858 --> 01:15:07.651
I see it now.

01:15:07.652 --> 01:15:10.153
All this time, you've been
like me gardening angel.

01:15:10.154 --> 01:15:12.197
Guardian angel.

01:15:12.198 --> 01:15:16.876
- Wow!
- Keith, I fixed you to fix me.

01:15:16.911 --> 01:15:19.913
You helped me get my wings
by seeing the error of your ways.

01:15:19.914 --> 01:15:23.333
And I helped you experience
a life that you thought you wanted.

01:15:23.334 --> 01:15:27.798
But sometimes what you want
isn't always what you really need.

01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:30.424
I know what I need.

01:15:30.425 --> 01:15:35.601
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's get our groove on, motherfucker.

01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:43.104
Put me down, you're gonna kill me!

01:15:43.105 --> 01:15:45.022
Stop crying like a little pussy.

01:15:45.023 --> 01:15:47.447
I think I've got
a brown onion in me pants.

01:16:11.634 --> 01:16:15.137
There she is.
The United States of Leeds.

01:16:16.931 --> 01:16:21.059
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.
That's it. Your time's up.

01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:23.978
And it looks like a no-show from Lemon.

01:16:23.979 --> 01:16:26.272
He can't like you that much, can he, eh'?

01:16:26.273 --> 01:16:31.486
Livin' <i>la vida loca</i> down at London,
with Kelly Brook.

01:16:31.487 --> 01:16:33.113
- Do you know what I think'?
- No.

01:16:33.114 --> 01:16:34.364
I think you're jealous of him.

01:16:34.365 --> 01:16:36.450
I think you wish you were in London
with Kelly Brook,

01:16:36.451 --> 01:16:39.494
not stuck here in this shithole
with your broken-nosed boyfriend.

01:16:39.495 --> 01:16:44.082
You haven't even got a wide-screen telly.
But do you know what'? Keith has.

01:16:44.083 --> 01:16:46.168
And his is much bigger than yours.

01:16:46.169 --> 01:16:48.003
And I'm not just
talking about his telly.

01:16:48.004 --> 01:16:49.922
She has a point, you know.

01:16:49.923 --> 01:16:53.307
I thought you said
you liked my tiny cock.

01:16:53.551 --> 01:16:56.929
You said it fit inside you
as snug as a bug in a rug.

01:16:56.930 --> 01:17:00.265
You know, some...
Dennis, what's going on with your mouth'?

01:17:00.266 --> 01:17:01.392
I don't know.

01:17:01.393 --> 01:17:04.520
Sometimes I just don't know
where I stand with you, Dennis, I don't.

01:17:04.521 --> 01:17:07.231
It's a hug and a slap,
and it's a hug and a slap.

01:17:07.232 --> 01:17:09.739
You'll get a slap when Keith gets back.

01:17:10.277 --> 01:17:11.735
That rhymes.

01:17:11.736 --> 01:17:14.989
Lower her into the vat,
you wonky-mouth twat.

01:17:14.990 --> 01:17:17.461
There's another rhyme for you there.

01:17:23.248 --> 01:17:25.583
That's enough!

01:17:25.584 --> 01:17:27.794
Dougie!

01:17:30.297 --> 01:17:32.298
That's gotta hurt.

01:17:32.299 --> 01:17:35.384
Down there.
Evil Steve's warehouse venue thing.

01:17:35.385 --> 01:17:37.643
Ready, man'?

01:17:39.473 --> 01:17:40.640
I'm ready.

01:17:40.641 --> 01:17:43.231
- Good luck.
- Shit!

01:17:43.435 --> 01:17:46.275
- Peace, bruv.
- Shit!

01:17:51.068 --> 01:17:52.402
- Keith?
- Rosie.

01:17:52.403 --> 01:17:54.696
Where have you been'?

01:17:56.365 --> 01:17:58.283
I don't know where I've been.

01:17:58.284 --> 01:18:00.535
I was so far up me arse
chasing me dream,

01:18:00.536 --> 01:18:02.495
I couldn't see for shit.

01:18:02.496 --> 01:18:07.008
But I want you to know
all the stupid things that I did...

01:18:07.126 --> 01:18:13.340
Abandoning you and having sex
through clothes with a famous floozy,

01:18:13.341 --> 01:18:16.885
it doesn't actually reflect
on how I feel about you.

01:18:16.886 --> 01:18:18.720
Are you gonna get me down now?

01:18:18.721 --> 01:18:21.223
You're the second best thing
that's ever happened to me.

01:18:21.224 --> 01:18:23.268
Second'? What's the first?

01:18:23.268 --> 01:18:26.770
- Kelly Brook, obviously. I'm joking.
- Right, get me down so I can hit you.

01:18:26.771 --> 01:18:29.408
But I'm not joking when I say...

01:18:30.150 --> 01:18:32.109
I say that I love you.

01:18:32.110 --> 01:18:36.363
And I love you more than I love myself.

01:18:36.364 --> 01:18:38.991
And I love myself a lot.

01:18:38.992 --> 01:18:42.494
But I love you even morerer..rer.

01:18:42.495 --> 01:18:45.298
What I'm saying is, um...

01:18:47.918 --> 01:18:50.305
Will you marry me'?

01:18:51.129 --> 01:18:53.005
Why would I wanna marry an arrogant,

01:18:53.006 --> 01:18:56.936
self-obsessed know-it-all
who actually don't know anything'?

01:18:59.179 --> 01:19:02.682
Because you said that I make you smile.

01:19:02.683 --> 01:19:05.351
Well, I'm not smiling now, am I'?

01:19:05.352 --> 01:19:08.856
What, not even if I do my honk voice'?

01:19:14.611 --> 01:19:17.747
My boobs.

01:19:22.077 --> 01:19:24.833
You're smiling. Is that a yes'?

01:19:27.082 --> 01:19:28.333
Yes.

01:19:28.334 --> 01:19:30.722
Yarussky!

01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:33.922
- Can you do me a favour'?
- Anything.

01:19:33.923 --> 01:19:36.591
Get her down, you fucking idiot.

01:19:36.592 --> 01:19:40.143
Come on, then.

01:19:43.933 --> 01:19:46.487
Heaven, here I come.

01:19:47.144 --> 01:19:49.646
Let's go sort this wedding out.

01:19:49.647 --> 01:19:52.149
Douglas, I'm sorry
for calling you a wronghead.

01:19:52.150 --> 01:19:53.525
- That's all right.
- Also,

01:19:53.526 --> 01:19:56.236
I'm demoting you as the main man.

01:19:56.237 --> 01:19:59.788
- Fair do's.
- You're now the best man.

01:20:00.491 --> 01:20:03.577
Yes! Thank you, Jesus!

01:20:03.578 --> 01:20:05.621
Oh, Keith, I'll get
a speech off internet.

01:20:05.622 --> 01:20:06.788
I'll be ever so... Oh!

01:20:06.789 --> 01:20:09.296
Ow! Oh, Dougie.

01:20:09.334 --> 01:20:12.252
<i>Later on, we'll be talking about
the devastating effects</i>

01:20:12.253 --> 01:20:14.838
<i>of the Lemon Phone,
the Keith Lemon Phone.</i>

01:20:14.839 --> 01:20:19.259
<i>So if you or anyone else you know
has been affected by its effects,</i>

01:20:19.260 --> 01:20:23.013
<i>then we'll be talking about the effects
if it has affected you.</i>

01:20:23.014 --> 01:20:26.642
<i>But first, just a few weeks ago,
we met a lady with two vaginae.</i>

01:20:26.643 --> 01:20:28.435
<i>Today, as pan' of our sex week,</i>

01:20:28.436 --> 01:20:31.105
<i>we meet a man
with a penis and one vagina.</i>

01:20:31.106 --> 01:20:33.945
<i>Weird Paul, thank you
very much indeed for coming in.</i>

01:20:36.695 --> 01:20:38.029
<i>And as the credits roll,</i>

01:20:38.030 --> 01:20:41.324
<i>thus ends me
2D cinematic moralistic journey.</i>

01:20:41.325 --> 01:20:43.159
<i>I'd like to tell you that
I turned the Securipoles</i>

01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:45.995
<i>into water pumps for the thirsty kids
of the Fourth World.</i>

01:20:45.996 --> 01:20:50.041
<i>Or that I found me real dad
and he taught me the genuine meaning</i>

01:20:50.042 --> 01:20:52.627
<i>of rasclaats and bumbasquat and ting.</i>

01:20:52.628 --> 01:20:55.630
<i>Or even that I
continued to dry-hump Kelly Brook</i>

01:20:55.631 --> 01:20:59.592
<i>until I broke her tuppence
into a thousand pieces.</i>

01:20:59.593 --> 01:21:00.969
<i>But the simple truth is,</i>

01:21:00.970 --> 01:21:03.680
<i>well, I settled down with Rosie
and we had three kids.</i>

01:21:03.681 --> 01:21:07.433
<i>Eminem, Britney and One Direction.</i>

01:21:07.434 --> 01:21:10.937
<i>Archimedes could well have been
a pigmentation of me imagination.</i>

01:21:10.938 --> 01:21:12.063
<i>But you know what?</i>

01:21:12.064 --> 01:21:14.774
<i>His scripted dialogue
learned me an important lesson.</i>

01:21:14.775 --> 01:21:16.985
<i>The grass may be greener
on the other side,</i>

01:21:16.986 --> 01:21:19.988
<i>but I'm happy with me crazy paving.</i>

01:21:19.989 --> 01:21:22.782
<i>And in answer to the question
that people always ask me,</i>

01:21:22.783 --> 01:21:26.995
<i>yes, that is the size of me real penis.</i>

01:21:26.996 --> 01:21:29.456
<i>As thick as a Coke can.</i>

01:21:29.457 --> 01:21:33.470
<i>If I don't see you through t'week,
I'll see you through t'window.</i>

01:21:35.171 --> 01:21:36.505
<i>Hey, I'll tell you what,
let's have some bloopers</i>

01:21:36.506 --> 01:21:37.673
like in Cannonball Run.

01:21:37.674 --> 01:21:42.268
<i>I thought that was fucking ace
when they did that in that film.</i>

01:21:43.304 --> 01:21:47.069
I'm strawberry blond.
I'm strawberry blond, aren't I'?

01:21:47.934 --> 01:21:49.810
Leigh, stop fucking laughing.

01:21:49.811 --> 01:21:50.936
<i>Sorry...</i>

01:21:50.937 --> 01:21:53.981
- Sorry. Yeah, I know.
- This is it now.

01:21:53.982 --> 01:21:57.610
There's something on Paddy's chin
just there, a little bit shiny.

01:21:57.611 --> 01:21:59.069
I think it's my lipstick.

01:21:59.070 --> 01:22:00.529
- All right.
- Oh, dear.

01:22:00.530 --> 01:22:01.989
Wonder how it got there'?

01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:03.282
That's a little bit awkward.

01:22:03.283 --> 01:22:04.575
- Really?
- Stand by.

01:22:04.576 --> 01:22:09.413
And the cavalier attitude,
I was sound as a sound.

01:22:09.414 --> 01:22:12.254
Sound as a sound.

01:22:13.752 --> 01:22:15.586
Sound as a pound.

01:22:15.587 --> 01:22:18.972
What the fuck
is this piece of shit, bruv?

01:22:19.299 --> 01:22:21.092
Well, that were me phone
and it looks like you broke it.

01:22:21.093 --> 01:22:24.976
