00:01.216 --> 00:03.151
Gyp: <i>Nucky Thompson,</i>
<i>Arnold Rothstein...</i>

00:03.185 --> 00:05.688
give me your blessing,
I'll kill them all.

00:05.721 --> 00:09.558
And when I do, they're gonna
call you Joe the King.

00:09.592 --> 00:11.226
Your pal Rosetti's
flown the coop.

00:11.261 --> 00:12.829
You think
I wanted him here?

00:12.863 --> 00:15.431
He comes back, you pick up the phone.
You hear me?

00:15.466 --> 00:17.401
I swear, Eli,
on my kids.

00:17.435 --> 00:20.771
- You should come with me.
- Okay.

00:20.805 --> 00:22.672
It's hard to know
what to say to you.

00:22.707 --> 00:25.008
Say anything you want.

00:25.042 --> 00:27.544
Esther: <i>Andrew Mellon is the head</i>
<i>of the treasury department.</i>

00:27.578 --> 00:29.580
He's responsible
for enforcing Prohibition

00:29.614 --> 00:31.648
and he despises
Harry Daugherty.

00:31.683 --> 00:35.886
A few days from now, Treasury
agents will arrest George Remus

00:35.920 --> 00:38.488
for multiple violations
of the Volstead Act,

00:38.523 --> 00:41.225
<i>including the purchase</i>
<i>of government liquor permits</i>

00:41.260 --> 00:44.696
<i>from a close associate of the Attorney</i>
<i>General of the United States.</i>

00:44.730 --> 00:46.097
Where are we
with the pony?

00:46.131 --> 00:48.065
- Hot tip?
- For Emily's birthday.

00:48.100 --> 00:50.434
<i>Leave it to me.</i>
<i>I'll get her all fixed up.</i>

00:52.437 --> 00:56.207
I lost an earring.
Those hummingbirds you gave me.

00:56.242 --> 00:57.709
I'll buy you new ones.

01:00.213 --> 01:02.481
Are you familiar
with Babette's?

01:02.515 --> 01:04.717
I ate there with Nucky
before our falling-out.

01:04.751 --> 01:06.419
Gillian: <i>He'll be dining there</i>
<i>this evening</i>

01:06.453 --> 01:08.555
<i>with Mr. Rothstein.</i>

01:12.360 --> 01:14.762

Man:
<i>Bring it back over.</i>

02:54.272 --> 02:55.873
<i>Keep your head down.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

02:55.907 --> 02:57.141
Man #2:
<i>Easy, easy.</i>

02:57.175 --> 02:59.076
<i>Can I give you</i>
<i>a hand with that?</i>

02:59.111 --> 03:01.445
- <i>Tie it off.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

03:01.480 --> 03:05.148
<i>( chatter continues )</i>
<i>Take it through there now!</i>

03:05.183 --> 03:09.186
- 12th block!
- <i>Move it! Move it!</i>

03:09.220 --> 03:11.755
<i>Fellas, come on,</i>
<i>let's keep it going.</i>

03:17.662 --> 03:19.496
( crowd murmuring )

03:19.531 --> 03:22.366
Settle down there, son.
Watch him, all right?

03:22.400 --> 03:26.103
No one's gonna be able to come through
until we're sure it's absolutely safe.

03:29.441 --> 03:31.309
<i>( high-pitched ringing )</i>

03:31.344 --> 03:33.979
Doctor:
<i>Watch my finger.</i>

03:34.013 --> 03:36.315
<i>( clock ticking )</i>

03:38.852 --> 03:40.185
Good.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.855
Good? I can't fucking
see straight.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.357
That'll pass.

03:44.391 --> 03:45.958
And the ringing
in my ears?

03:46.026 --> 03:47.627
Tinnitus.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.295
Consistent with concussion.

03:49.330 --> 03:52.064
Are you experiencing
any numbness?

03:52.099 --> 03:53.599
( sighs )
I only wish.

03:53.634 --> 03:56.669
Everything fucking hurts.
Particularly my head.

03:56.703 --> 03:59.037
The powder's not helping?
The phenacetin?

03:59.072 --> 04:01.140
He's very stubborn not
to take his medications.

04:01.174 --> 04:02.209
Because they don't work.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.542
Why don't you give me
something stronger?

04:04.543 --> 04:05.977
I could prescribe
laudanum,

04:06.012 --> 04:08.213
but it's just as likely
to give you headaches.

04:08.247 --> 04:09.881
What you need
is bed rest.

04:09.915 --> 04:12.117
Your brain's been injured.
It needs time to heal.

04:12.151 --> 04:14.619
Call Eddie.
Get him over here.

04:14.653 --> 04:16.654
But I am here.

04:16.689 --> 04:18.189
Not you,
my brother.

04:18.224 --> 04:21.093
- Eli. - That's what I said.
Jesus.

04:21.127 --> 04:22.995
I will call him
right away.

04:25.665 --> 04:27.800
One of the symptoms
of concussion

04:27.834 --> 04:31.503
is a temporary lack
of mental acuity,

04:31.538 --> 04:33.639
which can
come and go.

04:33.673 --> 04:37.143
Feeling in a fog.
Confusion.

04:40.013 --> 04:41.747
I've got to get dressed.

04:41.781 --> 04:43.816
<i>( high-pitched ringing )</i>

04:43.850 --> 04:45.585
Doctor: <i>Nucky?</i>
<i>Nuck... whoa.</i>

04:45.619 --> 04:47.854
- Easy does it.
- I'm fine.

04:47.888 --> 04:49.523
- I'll just...
- All right.

04:49.557 --> 04:52.592
I'll just lie down
for a minute.

04:54.929 --> 04:56.730
<i>You're very</i>
<i>fortunate, Nucky.</i>

04:56.764 --> 04:59.533
<i>An explosion like that,</i>
<i>a few feet closer...</i>

04:59.567 --> 05:01.735
<i>( voices screaming )</i>

05:04.639 --> 05:07.107
( gasps )

05:07.142 --> 05:09.810
Get out, Carl.

05:09.844 --> 05:11.879
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

05:11.913 --> 05:15.015
- Teddy: <i>Give that back, Regina.</i>
- Come back here with that.

05:15.050 --> 05:18.653
Teddy: <i>Come back here.</i>
<i>Come on, Regina.</i>

05:18.687 --> 05:20.989
- Drop it.
- Chase her, Mommy.

05:21.057 --> 05:22.791
It's not a game.

05:22.825 --> 05:25.159
Drop it!
Come back here.

05:25.194 --> 05:28.196
( ringing continues )

05:29.598 --> 05:32.400
Thompson suite.
Who's calling, please?

05:33.669 --> 05:35.937
I asked you first.

05:35.972 --> 05:38.040
- Because the person...
- Thank you, young man.

05:38.074 --> 05:40.309
<i>( dog growling )</i>

05:41.945 --> 05:44.447
Mr. Thompson's room.
How may I help you?

05:44.481 --> 05:47.617
You're to give yourself
a proper scrubbing.

05:47.651 --> 05:50.153
What's the difference?
We're not going anywhere.

05:50.187 --> 05:51.855
We're not, are we?

05:51.889 --> 05:55.459
We can go downstairs to
the Palm Court for cakes.

05:55.493 --> 05:57.828
Emily: <i>Can't we order</i>
<i>room service?</i>

05:57.862 --> 06:00.364
Ahem.

06:00.398 --> 06:03.300
Make your bed.

06:05.536 --> 06:08.738
They will deliver the
decorations shortly.

06:10.307 --> 06:13.142
All the furniture in the living
room needs to be moved out.

06:13.176 --> 06:15.611
I will call down
to the staff.

06:21.117 --> 06:23.786
I asked you
to make your bed.

06:23.820 --> 06:25.588
The maid will do it.

06:27.357 --> 06:30.293
There won't always be maids.

06:30.327 --> 06:32.362
- ( barks )
- Stop it.

06:32.396 --> 06:34.964
You're driving me mad.

06:41.805 --> 06:43.539
Where is Mr. Sleater?

06:43.574 --> 06:46.242
In there.

06:50.714 --> 06:52.782
( knocks )

06:57.520 --> 07:01.123
- I, uh...
- Owen: <i>Don't be a prat. Let her in.</i>

07:07.164 --> 07:09.165
May I speak
with you?

07:22.413 --> 07:23.880
Where did they
all come from?

07:23.914 --> 07:26.182
Each ward boss
sent over three.

07:26.216 --> 07:29.452
- How's the children's wing?
- A bit tetchy.

07:29.486 --> 07:32.688
- <i>I can't blame them.</i>
- And a birthday party on top of it.

07:32.722 --> 07:35.324
They'll be content
once it's underway.

07:35.359 --> 07:38.894
Not a wandering vagrant
this time, is it?

07:41.698 --> 07:43.665
Knowing nothing
doesn't make it better.

07:43.699 --> 07:46.601
It's Mr. Rosetti.
As you probably guessed.

07:46.635 --> 07:48.502
What did Enoch do to him?

07:48.537 --> 07:52.273
Said no when he
wanted to hear yes.

07:52.340 --> 07:55.842
- <i>That's all?</i>
- Sometimes that's enough.

07:57.312 --> 07:59.814
He's more than welcome
to take his dog back.

08:02.451 --> 08:04.252
This won't last forever.

08:04.286 --> 08:06.888
I know... it's for
our own safety,

08:06.922 --> 08:08.923
and there's no point
in complaining.

08:08.957 --> 08:10.591
That's not what I meant.

08:12.561 --> 08:14.762
When this is all sorted,

08:14.796 --> 08:16.431
you and I...

08:19.601 --> 08:22.236
What did Dr. Surran say?

08:22.304 --> 08:24.672
- Huh?
- What did...

08:24.707 --> 08:26.174
I have impetigo.

08:26.208 --> 08:28.577
Really?

08:28.611 --> 08:30.746
Might as well.

08:30.780 --> 08:33.448
He never gets
anything right.

08:34.984 --> 08:36.485
Should you
be doing that?

08:37.754 --> 08:39.988
What?
You're muttering.

08:40.023 --> 08:42.991
I said do you think
it's wise...

08:43.025 --> 08:45.427
We need to
discuss something...

08:45.461 --> 08:49.030
the three of us,
right now.

08:51.534 --> 08:54.002
What happened?

08:56.672 --> 08:58.339
To the pony?

08:58.374 --> 09:01.175
- I'm sorry?
- Pony.

09:01.210 --> 09:04.712
- The pony. The goddamn pony.
- We didn't buy a pony.

09:04.746 --> 09:06.813
Why the hell not?
Wasn't I clear on this?

09:06.848 --> 09:09.816
Because, as it turns out,
we're living in a hotel,

09:09.851 --> 09:13.386
and they don't allow horses.
Not even small ones.

09:14.822 --> 09:16.822
Well, that's a shame.

09:18.791 --> 09:21.059
Just a crying shame.

09:21.094 --> 09:22.861
For that angel.

09:23.997 --> 09:26.198
When it's going
to be her birthday.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.668
I don't think
it's the most important

09:29.702 --> 09:32.171
concern right now,
do you?

09:35.342 --> 09:37.176
What do you think?

09:38.478 --> 09:41.513
Mrs. Thompson is right.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.550
There's got to be a party.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.954
There will be.
It's all arranged for tomorrow.

09:47.988 --> 09:51.290
That just is going
to have to happen.

09:51.324 --> 09:52.892
We'll have it here.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.960
So let's get started on that.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.729
Let's get the wheels turning.

09:56.763 --> 10:00.266
<i>( high-pitched ringing )</i>

10:01.902 --> 10:04.703
Owen:
<i>Mr. Thompson, sir?</i>

10:06.039 --> 10:08.374
Margaret:
<i>Enoch?</i>

10:11.078 --> 10:13.079
Did you say something?

10:14.415 --> 10:17.184
I said it's being
taken care of.

10:21.722 --> 10:24.491
I don't know what to tell you.
It's just a little sideline is all.

10:24.525 --> 10:27.727
If you sell alcohol, I,
the sheriff's department,

10:27.761 --> 10:29.763
gets a piece of it.
That was made very clear.

10:29.797 --> 10:31.698
It's just a few quarts
of home brew, Jerry.

10:31.733 --> 10:33.500
The amount
doesn't matter.

10:33.535 --> 10:35.402
You saw how things
can get out of hand.

10:35.436 --> 10:37.137
You answer to me.

10:37.171 --> 10:39.239
And I keep it all straight with
the Big lke on the boardwalk.

10:39.273 --> 10:42.409
That way there's
no confusion.

10:42.443 --> 10:44.478
Now, I'll let it go
this once, but...

10:44.512 --> 10:46.747
are you listening to me?

10:46.814 --> 10:49.483
Don't walk away
when I'm talking to...

11:25.420 --> 11:27.988
- <i>Operator.</i>
- This is Sheriff Ramsey.

11:28.023 --> 11:29.757
Get me the Ritz-Carlton
in Atlantic City.

11:29.791 --> 11:32.126
- Nucky Thompson's room.
- <i>Right away, sir.</i>

11:32.194 --> 11:34.796
Man: <i>Top floor, the other side.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

11:34.830 --> 11:36.998
<i>( men shouting )</i>

11:39.435 --> 11:41.570
Shit.

11:45.475 --> 11:48.044
You and you, with me.
You guys cover the back.

11:48.112 --> 11:50.480
( bangs )

11:55.686 --> 11:57.887
Howdy, Sheriff.

11:59.990 --> 12:03.193
What's new
on the prairie?

12:03.261 --> 12:05.496
Gyp.

12:05.530 --> 12:07.565
Good to see you again.

12:08.934 --> 12:11.403
What's so good
about it?

12:11.437 --> 12:13.571
You miss my company?

12:14.940 --> 12:17.474
<i>You like</i>
<i>the way I look?</i>

12:18.610 --> 12:21.678
What are you,
some kind of <i>finook?</i>

12:21.713 --> 12:23.914
( chuckles nervously )

12:23.948 --> 12:26.283
Just ready to get
back to business.

12:26.317 --> 12:28.986
No kidding.

12:31.089 --> 12:33.157
You've been
twiddling your thumbs...

12:33.191 --> 12:34.959
Operator: <i>Hello, sir?</i>
<i>This is the operator.</i>

12:34.993 --> 12:36.894
waiting for me
to show up?

12:36.962 --> 12:39.263
<i>You're connected</i>
<i>to the Ritz-Carlton.</i>

12:39.297 --> 12:42.165
Just a minute, operator.

12:45.403 --> 12:47.971
There's no need
for any of that.

12:50.341 --> 12:52.876
You know me.

12:52.943 --> 12:55.345
I'm flexible.

12:55.379 --> 12:57.914
( chuckles )

12:57.948 --> 13:00.517
Not for much longer.

13:02.187 --> 13:03.687
Ah!

13:03.722 --> 13:06.357
( grunting )

13:06.391 --> 13:08.526
- <i>( high-pitched ringing )</i>
- Bader: <i>These goddamn reporters.</i>

13:08.561 --> 13:09.596
- <i>They're relentless.</i>

13:09.597 --> 13:10.729
- Damien: <i>They're insisting</i>
<i>on a statement, Nuck.</i>

13:10.730 --> 13:13.198
We could say an anarchist.

13:13.232 --> 13:15.667
Or like that explosion
on Wall Street.

13:15.702 --> 13:19.205
Someone they let go
carry a grudge.

13:19.239 --> 13:22.074
Well, whatever it was,
we're just glad you're okay.

13:22.109 --> 13:24.376
When are we
rebuilding, anyway?

13:24.410 --> 13:26.245
Maybe I talk to you
about that.

13:26.279 --> 13:27.947
What's it got
to do with you?

13:27.981 --> 13:30.115
That's what I want
to talk to you about.

13:30.150 --> 13:32.084
Shut that goddamn shade.

13:37.290 --> 13:39.058
Chalky: <i>We don't got to do</i>
<i>this now, Nuck.</i>

13:39.092 --> 13:40.792
When did you get so uppity?

13:40.827 --> 13:44.096
- Come again?
- Work on my shoes later.

13:45.465 --> 13:47.566
This is Mr. White.

13:50.870 --> 13:52.471
Gas.

13:53.440 --> 13:55.108
You want some
bicarbonate?

13:55.142 --> 13:57.611
Babette's. Tell them
it was a gas leak.

13:57.645 --> 14:00.981
- <i>( ringing resumes )</i>
- ( sighs )

14:06.087 --> 14:07.721
Nuck?

14:07.756 --> 14:10.958
It was a faulty valve.
That's what caused the explosion.

14:10.992 --> 14:13.594
- Well, that makes sense.
- Get me some water.

14:15.731 --> 14:18.933
<i>( phone ringing )</i>

14:24.073 --> 14:26.541
Don't I have someone
who answers that?

14:28.744 --> 14:31.379
Mr. Thompson's room.
Who's calling, please?

14:37.987 --> 14:39.788
Have an inspector come out.

14:39.822 --> 14:42.424
Certify the other lines on
the boardwalk are sound.

14:42.458 --> 14:44.526
Guarantee the public
there's no danger.

14:44.561 --> 14:45.863
Nucky: <i>You should be</i>
<i>at the hospital</i>

14:45.896 --> 14:47.896
<i>handing out flowers</i>
<i>to the victims.</i>

14:47.897 --> 14:50.366
- Take a photographer.
- <i>( door opens )</i>

14:51.767 --> 14:54.202
Teddy, this is business.
You can't just walk in.

14:54.236 --> 14:57.072
- A man is on the phone.
- What man?

14:58.474 --> 15:00.408
The gypsy.

15:03.745 --> 15:06.647
Uh, gentlemen, if you please.

15:06.682 --> 15:10.017
Oh, yeah. Don't worry, Nuck.
We'll take care of it.

15:10.052 --> 15:11.686
Everything's all right.
Go to your mother.

15:11.720 --> 15:14.689
I'll be at the hospital.

15:16.625 --> 15:17.692
Hello?

15:17.726 --> 15:19.794
I want to read you
something from the paper.

15:19.828 --> 15:23.131
<i>Plucked my heartstrings,</i>
<i>I don't know why.</i>

15:23.165 --> 15:26.934
"Lights dimmed all along
the Rialto last night

15:26.968 --> 15:30.604
<i>for a fallen star who had</i>
<i>just begun to shine.</i>

15:30.638 --> 15:34.474

15:50.792 --> 15:53.961
What were we talking about?
The party?

15:53.995 --> 15:55.729
The gas leak.

15:55.763 --> 15:58.331
Don't tell the kids about it.
It'll just upset them.

15:58.366 --> 16:01.034
Nobody's talking about
telling kids anything.

16:01.068 --> 16:04.470
They'll find out.
Everyone finds out soon enough.

16:04.505 --> 16:07.406
You know what I'm saying, don't you?

16:07.441 --> 16:09.174
I'm not sure that I do.

16:09.209 --> 16:11.410
One day you wake up and you
realize what's been going on.

16:11.444 --> 16:14.112
( phone rings )

16:14.180 --> 16:15.848
You hung up before
I had a chance.

16:15.882 --> 16:18.317
- To do what?
- <i>Offer condolences.</i>

16:18.351 --> 16:20.419
From me and Joe Masseria.

16:20.454 --> 16:22.589
<i>Why don't you come</i>
<i>see me sometime?</i>

16:22.623 --> 16:25.825
<i>I'm right up the road</i>
<i>in Tabor Heights.</i>

16:25.859 --> 16:28.094
Was it him?
What was...

16:37.338 --> 16:39.506
What the fuck are you doing?

16:39.540 --> 16:41.875
Stopping you before
you wreck the whole floor.

16:41.910 --> 16:44.946
Who the goddamn hell
do you think you are?

16:46.215 --> 16:48.015
Who is he?

16:48.050 --> 16:50.785
Chalky:
<i>That's your brother, Nuck.</i>

16:50.819 --> 16:53.321
You need to catch
ahold of yourself.

16:56.825 --> 16:59.327
Frankie Yale,
Waxey Gordon,

16:59.361 --> 17:03.097
Peg Leg Lonergan,
and Bill Lovett in Brooklyn.

17:03.131 --> 17:05.833
Torrio if he'll come,

17:05.867 --> 17:07.435
and Arnold Rothstein...

17:07.469 --> 17:09.637
we need to get them
here soon as possible.

17:09.671 --> 17:11.038
What for?

17:11.073 --> 17:13.340
Joe Masseria
is backing Gyp Rosetti.

17:13.375 --> 17:15.643
So I'll need
to kill them both.

17:19.448 --> 17:21.915
Joe Masseria has an army.

17:21.951 --> 17:25.619
That's why we're going
to need help.

17:28.591 --> 17:32.293
Don't look at me that way.
What I'm saying makes perfect sense.

17:33.963 --> 17:36.965
Mad Anthony Wayne.

17:38.167 --> 17:40.035
Anthony.

17:40.069 --> 17:41.837
He was Italian?

17:41.871 --> 17:44.039
I'm not sure.

17:44.073 --> 17:45.941
But he was a brigadier general

17:45.975 --> 17:47.876
in the Continental Army.

17:47.910 --> 17:49.812
On his way to the Battle
of Monmouth County,

17:49.846 --> 17:52.715
he spent two days encamped
here in Tabor Heights.

17:52.749 --> 17:55.684
Did the town, huh?

17:55.718 --> 17:58.553
We're ready over here.

18:00.657 --> 18:03.292
Pardon me.

18:03.326 --> 18:06.395
<i>( people chatting )</i>

18:11.267 --> 18:13.202
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

18:13.236 --> 18:17.072
First things out the way,
thank you for coming.

18:17.106 --> 18:19.140
Those of you who were curious

18:19.175 --> 18:22.009
and those who were
maybe escorted here.

18:23.512 --> 18:26.113
My name is Mr. Rosetti.

18:26.147 --> 18:28.582
My associates and me
have taken an interest

18:28.616 --> 18:30.583
<i>in your town and are gonna</i>
<i>be here for a while.</i>

18:30.618 --> 18:33.252
So we thought it
only neighborly

18:33.287 --> 18:35.921
<i>to introduce</i>
<i>ourselves.</i>

18:35.956 --> 18:37.656
In return for your hospitality

18:37.691 --> 18:39.725
and any inconvenience
this may cause,

18:39.759 --> 18:42.561
we're offering
a monthly giveback.

18:42.595 --> 18:44.896
Tell them how much
we're offering.

18:44.931 --> 18:47.966
A double C apiece.

18:49.468 --> 18:51.870
- In English.
- $200 a month.

18:51.904 --> 18:55.640
Which is a pretty square deal
for keeping your mouth shut.

18:55.674 --> 18:57.375
Wouldn't you say,
Sheriff Ramsey?

18:57.410 --> 19:00.178
( crowd whispering )

19:00.213 --> 19:02.547
He's a good man,
your sheriff.

19:02.582 --> 19:04.950
And he's gonna
keep on sheriffing.

19:04.985 --> 19:08.254
<i>Same as you all are gonna keep</i>
<i>doing whatever it is you do.</i>

19:08.289 --> 19:10.657
Barbers cut hair.

19:10.691 --> 19:12.358
Cooks cook.

19:12.426 --> 19:14.928
Librarians keep
checking out books

19:14.962 --> 19:18.031
because it's very
important to read.

19:18.065 --> 19:20.900
- What happens when Bible Camp opens?
- Bible Camp's canceled.

19:20.934 --> 19:22.003
<i>And I'm not really</i>
<i>doing questions</i>

19:22.036 --> 19:23.136
<i>and answers</i>
<i>right now, dear.</i>

19:23.137 --> 19:24.337
- What do you think?
- Shh!

19:24.372 --> 19:26.573
Now if you'll all step
over to the table here

19:26.608 --> 19:27.808
to collect your money...

19:27.876 --> 19:30.344
( whispering )

19:30.378 --> 19:32.680
Be sure to write
your name and address.

19:32.714 --> 19:34.782
- What do you need that for?
- Bookkeeping.

19:34.816 --> 19:37.818
We like to know who
we're doing business with.

20:02.944 --> 20:05.880
Come on, what's
the big secret?

20:05.914 --> 20:08.516
It's not done yet.

20:08.550 --> 20:11.086
Okay.

20:12.655 --> 20:14.156
All done.

20:15.291 --> 20:17.626
Well, well.

20:17.660 --> 20:20.095
That's the train.
That's the station.

20:20.129 --> 20:21.463
And that's the little boy.

20:21.497 --> 20:24.633
- And what's that?
- That's the rhinoceros.

20:24.667 --> 20:27.669

- Waiting to go home.

there's a meeting

20:50.493 --> 20:53.062
One of your gatherings?

20:53.096 --> 20:56.165
To discuss more
service compensation.

Yes.

You're under arrest for violating
Title II of the Volstead Act

to Section 7.

- I'm correcting one.

No, no.
You can't do this.

Remus doesn't get arrested.
Not in his own home.

23:02.861 --> 23:05.629
Not anywhere.
Remus has paid.

23:05.663 --> 23:08.866

- What receipts?

26:22.496 --> 26:25.097
I put a cold
cloth on his head.

26:25.132 --> 26:26.532
Pour you a drink?

26:26.566 --> 26:28.600
No, thank you.
But help yourself.

26:28.635 --> 26:30.202
Nah.

26:30.236 --> 26:32.437
Never one for it,
truth to tell.

26:32.472 --> 26:35.875
That's funny, then, isn't it?

26:35.909 --> 26:37.509
How do you mean?

26:37.544 --> 26:40.713
Our whole lives
center around it.

26:40.747 --> 26:44.383
Everything we say
or don't say

26:44.417 --> 26:47.453
all in those bottles.

26:47.487 --> 26:50.924
It's just a business in the end.

26:50.958 --> 26:53.326
Is business meant
to be like this?

26:53.361 --> 26:56.863
Ask the man buried
in the coal mine.

26:56.898 --> 26:59.166
Or digging a canal.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.368
Or working a slaughterhouse.

27:02.703 --> 27:04.404
No one asks where what
they want comes from.

27:04.438 --> 27:05.939
They just want it...

27:06.006 --> 27:09.976
and then believe
what suits them.

27:11.746 --> 27:13.379
And that's your peace with it?

27:13.414 --> 27:16.216
There's no halfway.

27:17.451 --> 27:20.719
And there's no excuse either.
I'm in it now.

27:20.754 --> 27:22.888
And when I'm done,
I'll walk away.

27:22.922 --> 27:25.791
Do you mean to?

27:25.825 --> 27:27.592
Yeah, in a year,

27:27.626 --> 27:29.961
two years.

27:32.398 --> 27:34.065
Why not now?

27:34.099 --> 27:36.601
Is that what you want?

27:41.207 --> 27:43.542
If it is, say it.

27:45.378 --> 27:47.414
Say it and we'll go.

27:52.987 --> 27:55.788
It would have to be far.

27:57.457 --> 27:59.392
We're thousands
of miles already.

27:59.426 --> 28:01.527
What's a few more?

28:04.732 --> 28:08.035
You don't think I would.
That's why you're asking.

28:08.069 --> 28:10.270
No.

28:10.338 --> 28:12.607
I'm not as complicated as you.

28:35.799 --> 28:37.999
<i>( children shouting )</i>

28:38.000 --> 28:39.634
<i>- Oh, he threw the horn!</i>
<i>- Caught it!</i>

28:39.668 --> 28:41.335
<i>Oh, right back at him!</i>

28:41.369 --> 28:44.171
<i>( giggling )</i>

28:45.240 --> 28:47.908
<i>- I want another piece!</i>
<i>- Yeah!</i>

28:50.845 --> 28:52.846
Daddy's feeling better.

28:52.880 --> 28:54.981
He just needs to rest.

28:55.016 --> 28:57.417
<i>( music playing )</i>

29:11.365 --> 29:13.732
<i>( people chatting )</i>

29:21.274 --> 29:23.810
<i>( voices overlapping )</i>

29:23.844 --> 29:25.811
Woman: <i>Oh there you are!</i>
<i>Over here, over here!</i>

29:25.846 --> 29:29.783
- Man: <i>You'll miss the dance!</i>
- Woman: <i>Hurry up, we're late!</i>

29:29.817 --> 29:31.384
You came.

29:31.452 --> 29:34.020
Didn't I say I would?

29:34.054 --> 29:36.622
This is for you.

29:40.794 --> 29:42.628
You know my colors.

29:42.662 --> 29:44.763
I let the florist pick it.

29:44.831 --> 29:46.965
( laughs )

29:48.535 --> 29:50.435
I suppose we go in.

30:01.614 --> 30:03.815
<i>( music continues )</i>

30:14.225 --> 30:15.426
Richard.

30:15.460 --> 30:17.294
And Miss Sagorsky.

30:17.328 --> 30:19.630
- Good evening, Phil.
- Mr. Gardner.

30:19.664 --> 30:22.099
Richard and Miss Sagorsky.

30:22.133 --> 30:24.969
You just said that.

30:26.338 --> 30:28.740
I like the way it sounds.

30:28.774 --> 30:30.008
Is your pop coming?

30:30.042 --> 30:32.644
Not his kind of occasion.

30:32.712 --> 30:34.446
Maybe not.

30:34.481 --> 30:35.881
I'm glad you could
make it, though.

30:35.915 --> 30:39.351
Plenty of grub
and libations.

30:39.386 --> 30:41.487
I'll see you two on
the dance floor, hmm?

30:48.128 --> 30:49.862
There's punch.

30:49.896 --> 30:52.565
- Would you like some?
- I meant for you.

30:52.599 --> 30:55.167
Sounds like
a good place to start.

30:56.503 --> 30:59.905
Well, you're easy
to housebreak.

31:10.950 --> 31:14.219
- Well, here's a surprise.
- You looking for your pal?

31:14.253 --> 31:17.388
Go on.
She's waiting to see you.

31:17.456 --> 31:20.192
- You're awful.
- What?

31:25.098 --> 31:26.799
<i>( woman moaning )</i>
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

31:26.834 --> 31:30.202
<i>Uh-huh.</i>
<i>That's it.</i>

31:30.236 --> 31:33.405
Oh, yeah.
That's good.

31:33.439 --> 31:35.841
Oh, yeah?
Uh-huh.

31:35.875 --> 31:38.510
( moaning )

31:42.582 --> 31:44.650
- Oh! Chipmunk, no!
- What?

31:44.684 --> 31:46.652
Man:
<i>What the fuck is this now?</i>

31:46.719 --> 31:49.421
( laughs )

31:53.794 --> 31:55.628
( door slams )

31:57.064 --> 31:58.798
Oh.

31:58.833 --> 32:00.700
You're not to get up now.

32:00.768 --> 32:02.635
I'm fine.

32:02.670 --> 32:05.338
You're not.

32:05.372 --> 32:08.608
( sighs ) I just don't know
why everyone's whispering.

32:09.743 --> 32:11.344
You've a concussion.

32:11.378 --> 32:13.713
If you don't rest,
you'll make it worse.

32:16.016 --> 32:18.150
Can you hear
what I'm saying?

32:18.185 --> 32:20.653
Did she like the party?

32:20.687 --> 32:23.021
I...

32:23.056 --> 32:25.157
yes.

32:25.191 --> 32:27.025
Yes, she liked it.

32:27.060 --> 32:29.895
She rode the pony?

32:29.929 --> 32:32.063
No, wait.
We didn't get a pony.

32:32.098 --> 32:34.932
- I told you not to.
- That's right.

32:34.967 --> 32:37.735
Pony in a hotel.
Don't be ridiculous.

32:38.737 --> 32:40.638
You don't want to spoil them.

32:40.673 --> 32:43.208
Raise them right,
but don't spoil them.

32:43.243 --> 32:45.611
That's worth
keeping in mind.

32:47.213 --> 32:49.248
And you found
your earring.

32:49.282 --> 32:51.417
What?

32:51.484 --> 32:53.251
The earring you lost.

32:53.285 --> 32:55.587
The little bird.

32:57.156 --> 32:58.957
No.

32:58.991 --> 33:01.694
But I'm sure it'll turn up.

33:01.728 --> 33:04.062
- <i>( knocks )</i>
- Come in.

33:06.466 --> 33:09.268
- Don't mean to interrupt.
- You're not.

33:12.339 --> 33:14.307
- How you doing?
- Nucky: <i>Fine.</i>

33:14.341 --> 33:16.942
Just stop mumbling.
It's irritating.

33:16.977 --> 33:20.046
We should have a discussion
if you're up to it.

33:21.515 --> 33:23.816
- You want to do it here or...?
- Let's go to the office.

33:25.752 --> 33:27.953
<i>( high-pitched ringing )</i>

33:29.990 --> 33:31.824
Eli:
<i>You all right, Nuck?</i>

33:42.002 --> 33:43.903
Wasn't I standing?

33:43.938 --> 33:46.973
You're all right.

33:49.042 --> 33:50.876
Let's talk here.

33:52.712 --> 33:55.547
- Margaret: I'll go.
- No, stay.

33:55.581 --> 33:58.383
You belong here with me.

34:09.295 --> 34:11.197
Well?

34:22.577 --> 34:24.379
Um...

34:24.413 --> 34:26.447
they've all confirmed
for tonight

34:26.514 --> 34:28.282
except Torrio.

34:29.618 --> 34:31.851
If we were to call
it off at this point...

34:31.886 --> 34:34.755
- If we tell them not...
- There's no reason for that.

34:34.789 --> 34:37.091
But just, if we did.

34:37.125 --> 34:38.824
<i>The way things stand,</i>

34:38.860 --> 34:41.328
<i>it already could</i>
<i>go either way...</i>

34:41.362 --> 34:42.897
In terms of their support.

34:42.931 --> 34:45.065
For what you suggested.

34:45.100 --> 34:47.234
Regarding the man
in Little Italy

34:47.268 --> 34:49.837
and the other one.

34:49.871 --> 34:51.539
And I think...

34:51.572 --> 34:53.975
we both think
in your condition...

34:54.009 --> 34:55.944
It's not likely
to go in our favor.

34:55.978 --> 34:57.512
Eli:
<i>They'll need to feel</i>

34:57.547 --> 34:59.815
<i>as if you're firmly in</i>
<i>control of the situation.</i>

34:59.882 --> 35:02.250
Arnold Rothstein,
Waxey Gordon,

35:02.285 --> 35:04.519
Frankie Yale,
Peg Leg Lonergan,

35:04.554 --> 35:07.155
and Wild Bill Lovett...
they're all coming.

35:07.190 --> 35:09.791
They're going to sit down.

35:09.826 --> 35:13.262
When the meeting's over, Joe
Masseria will be a dead man.

35:13.296 --> 35:16.031
Gyp Rosetti won't have
anyone to protect him

35:16.066 --> 35:19.234
and I'll wear that fucking
dago's guts like a necktie.

35:29.512 --> 35:31.146
Was I slurring my words?

35:31.180 --> 35:33.382
No.
Clear as a bell.

35:35.351 --> 35:37.652
( sighs )

35:40.957 --> 35:44.159
Would you mind if I asked
you for some ice water?

35:48.297 --> 35:49.931
Man:
<i>Take it easy with that.</i>

35:49.965 --> 35:51.433
Man #2:
<i>I got it.</i>

35:51.467 --> 35:53.635
<i>( chatter continues )</i>

36:04.279 --> 36:05.813
That goes up to New York.

36:05.847 --> 36:07.648
Come on, keep it going.

36:07.683 --> 36:10.518
Gyp: <i>Those boats out there,</i>
<i>the lights?</i>

36:10.552 --> 36:12.086
Man: <i>Come on, keep it going.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>

36:12.120 --> 36:14.988
Rosetti:
Rum Row, they call it.

36:15.023 --> 36:18.291
We send our boats out,
they come back full of booze.

36:18.326 --> 36:20.827
From the beach here
to the trucks.

36:20.862 --> 36:24.164
From the trucks
to Little Italy

36:24.198 --> 36:27.067
and six hours later
you're sipping scotch.

36:27.101 --> 36:30.070
Man: <i>That boat's got the whiskey.</i>
<i>That goes down to AC.</i>

36:30.104 --> 36:32.306
What do you think?

36:32.373 --> 36:35.309
I think...

36:35.343 --> 36:38.245
you'll make
some problems for me.

36:38.279 --> 36:40.815
Rothstein.

36:40.882 --> 36:42.283
Nucky Thompson.

36:42.317 --> 36:44.652
I got a tip they was both
gonna be in the same place.

36:44.687 --> 36:47.622
Ah, but you
no prepare properly.

36:47.657 --> 36:49.191
I had to move fast, boss.

36:49.225 --> 36:51.060
Boss?

36:51.094 --> 36:54.130
I thought you said king.

36:54.164 --> 36:56.532
Huh?

36:59.703 --> 37:02.338
- You got this one?
- Come on, let's go.

37:02.372 --> 37:05.107
( speaking Italian )

37:14.217 --> 37:16.185
Bravo.

37:19.322 --> 37:22.057
( speaking Italian )

37:59.899 --> 38:02.066
You will learn.

38:02.101 --> 38:04.869
You grow.

38:04.903 --> 38:08.073
Maybe one day you'll
make a good general.

38:09.942 --> 38:12.310
Man:
<i>Ya bunch of pansies!</i>

38:12.345 --> 38:14.479
( Joe speaks Italian )

38:15.481 --> 38:18.583
<i>( music playing )</i>

38:40.938 --> 38:42.739
Hey, Richard.

38:42.773 --> 38:44.807
When are you gonna show
us that fancy footwork?

38:44.842 --> 38:47.110
We're just watching.

38:47.144 --> 38:49.011
He doesn't want to put
the rest of us to shame.

38:49.046 --> 38:50.579
- Really?
- Sure.

38:50.614 --> 38:52.148
He's the one
who taught Arthur Murray.

38:52.215 --> 38:54.916
- Who?
- <i>Arthur Murray.</i>

38:54.951 --> 38:58.186
This is the song
I've been waiting for.

38:59.989 --> 39:02.424
Why do you have
to be such an ass?

39:07.063 --> 39:08.964
I don't know
what I'm doing.

39:08.998 --> 39:11.900
Put your hand
on my shoulder.

39:13.970 --> 39:17.539
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

39:17.573 --> 39:20.575
One, two, three.
Don't look down.

39:20.610 --> 39:22.911
- One, two, three.
- Sorry.

39:23.012 --> 39:24.913
One, two, three.

39:29.085 --> 39:31.354
You never said
you were good at this.

39:31.388 --> 39:33.189
Thank you.

39:36.861 --> 39:39.863
- It's the only step I know.
- ( laughs )

39:46.370 --> 39:48.872
What do we do
for a finish?

39:48.906 --> 39:51.807
Put your arm up.

39:51.842 --> 39:54.243
Trust me.

39:57.146 --> 40:00.382
( cheering, applause )

40:03.620 --> 40:05.488
Hold on.

40:05.522 --> 40:07.891
Let's give them
something to think about.

40:07.925 --> 40:10.260
- Whoo!
- Woman: <i>Ooh-la-la.</i>

40:10.327 --> 40:12.829
( applause )

40:21.573 --> 40:23.674
What time is it?

40:24.810 --> 40:26.878
14 minutes to 10:00.

40:26.913 --> 40:29.448
Are they here yet?
Rothstein?

40:29.482 --> 40:31.884
No.

40:33.153 --> 40:36.055
- Fuck.
- Please. Please.

40:38.858 --> 40:40.592
Did you order
his milk and cake?

40:40.627 --> 40:42.094
I did.

40:42.128 --> 40:44.763
He eats like
a fucking child.

40:44.797 --> 40:47.499
- ( chuckles )
- What time is it?

40:49.002 --> 40:51.069
Don't stare at me
like I'm an idiot.

40:51.104 --> 40:53.839
I asked you a question.

40:53.873 --> 40:56.375
It is now 13 minutes
to 10:00.

40:56.409 --> 40:59.011
- My jacket.
- <i>Ja.</i>

41:15.596 --> 41:18.264
- Nucky?
- ( retching )

41:36.114 --> 41:39.283

41:59.905 --> 42:01.839
Eddie:
<i>Nucky?</i>

42:35.675 --> 42:37.242
What's wrong?

42:37.277 --> 42:39.745
He's asking for you.
Please.

42:39.779 --> 42:42.147
Oh, but, missus,
the gentlemen are waiting.

43:03.336 --> 43:05.671
( crashing )

43:13.948 --> 43:15.949
There you are.

43:21.790 --> 43:24.324
You're burning up.

43:25.460 --> 43:27.662
<i>( water running )</i>

43:27.729 --> 43:29.830
I found it.

43:32.034 --> 43:34.068
So you don't have to worry.

43:34.102 --> 43:35.536
Found what?

43:42.277 --> 43:45.546
This belongs
to someone else.

43:45.580 --> 43:47.782
It does?

43:47.850 --> 43:49.951
Yes.

43:53.389 --> 43:56.325
<i>( high-pitched ringing )</i>

44:02.299 --> 44:04.967
<i>( people screaming )</i>

44:08.605 --> 44:10.839
She's dead.

44:13.009 --> 44:16.344
<i>She's dead</i>
<i>and it's my fault.</i>

44:19.648 --> 44:22.784
<i>Everything I touch...</i>

44:25.221 --> 44:28.757
You have to understand.

44:28.791 --> 44:32.494
No matter what
you think of me,

44:32.528 --> 44:35.163
there's no walking away.

44:35.198 --> 44:37.432
It doesn't work like that.

44:37.466 --> 44:40.068
<i>I do it to them</i>

44:40.102 --> 44:42.337
<i>or they do it to me.</i>

44:42.371 --> 44:45.040
That's all there is.

44:46.509 --> 44:48.677
And the men
in your office?

44:50.513 --> 44:53.415
Either they're with me

44:53.449 --> 44:56.351
and we go to war,

44:56.386 --> 44:59.187
or they'll smile,

44:59.221 --> 45:01.522
shake my hand,

45:01.557 --> 45:03.425
and walk away.

45:04.560 --> 45:06.995
I'll be alone...

45:07.029 --> 45:09.931
and that's
as good as dead.

45:13.403 --> 45:15.337
You can hear me?

45:17.874 --> 45:20.576
- Yes.
- You know who I am?

45:20.610 --> 45:22.712
You're Margaret Schroeder.

45:22.779 --> 45:24.347
Margaret Thompson.

45:26.350 --> 45:29.052
Yes.

45:29.087 --> 45:31.355
My wife.

45:31.389 --> 45:34.558
Sorry.
My wife.

45:34.593 --> 45:37.162
You need to get up.

45:37.196 --> 45:39.364
You need to finish
getting dressed.

45:39.398 --> 45:42.334
<i>And you need to attend</i>
<i>to your business.</i>

45:42.368 --> 45:44.636
Do you understand?

46:01.086 --> 46:03.420
I hope you're satisfied.

46:04.856 --> 46:06.623
With what?

46:06.658 --> 46:09.293
Tommy wandered onto
the girls' floor.

46:09.327 --> 46:12.129
What happened?

46:12.164 --> 46:15.065
What do you think
happened?

46:15.099 --> 46:17.801
You're meant to keep
a watch on such things

46:17.835 --> 46:19.936
<i>instead of running off</i>
<i>at night.</i>

46:19.971 --> 46:23.239
I gave him warm milk
with rum to calm him down.

46:24.776 --> 46:26.243
I'm sorry.

46:26.277 --> 46:29.446
The damage
is already done.

46:34.285 --> 46:38.155
Although I'm sure you had
a stimulating meeting.

46:56.007 --> 46:58.108
<i>( Tommy murmuring )</i>

47:15.226 --> 47:17.427
You okay?

47:19.196 --> 47:21.832
I want to go home.

47:35.880 --> 47:38.248
Mr. Torrio sends his regrets.

47:39.350 --> 47:41.218
How thoughtful.

47:41.252 --> 47:43.854
Chicago's a distance.
I wouldn't worry on it.

47:45.757 --> 47:47.224
Open the door

47:47.258 --> 47:50.461
and don't stand close to me.

47:51.496 --> 47:54.198
<i>( men chatting )</i>

48:05.144 --> 48:06.745
( whispers )
We'll go...

48:06.779 --> 48:09.014
as soon as we're able.

48:30.669 --> 48:32.870
<i>( high-pitched ringing )</i>

48:43.947 --> 48:47.216
You all came here
on short notice.

48:47.251 --> 48:49.685
I appreciate that.

48:49.720 --> 48:51.753
And I won't waste
anyone's time.

48:51.788 --> 48:55.624
Each of us has
our own interests.

48:55.691 --> 48:57.893
Each of us has
our own needs.

48:57.927 --> 49:01.062
None of us can proceed
without the goodwill

49:01.097 --> 49:03.899
and trust of...

49:10.707 --> 49:12.841
of our friends.

49:12.875 --> 49:15.144
I'm looking forward
to the future.

49:15.178 --> 49:17.446
There's going to be
new opportunities.

49:17.480 --> 49:19.314
Great opportunities.

49:19.349 --> 49:22.684
With sympathetic allies
in Washington

49:22.719 --> 49:25.187
and new markets
opening up to the west...

49:25.221 --> 49:27.256
all the way to Chicago.

49:27.290 --> 49:29.925
Opportunities
I intend to share

49:29.960 --> 49:32.361
to the benefit of all of us.

49:32.395 --> 49:35.230
Expansion, cooperation,

49:35.298 --> 49:38.166
profit, peace.

49:39.568 --> 49:41.536
Isn't that
what we all want?

49:41.570 --> 49:43.404
You're singing a different
tune from last time I come.

49:43.439 --> 49:46.641
I've reconsidered
my position, Frank.

49:46.675 --> 49:48.409
I don't blame you.

49:48.443 --> 49:49.944
I have a right
to protect myself.

49:49.978 --> 49:51.479
What's that got
to do with us?

49:51.513 --> 49:52.913
We're neighbors,
Waxey.

49:52.948 --> 49:55.449
<i>I got no beef</i>
<i>with Rosetti.</i>

49:55.517 --> 49:56.750
Not yet.

49:56.785 --> 49:59.253
I don't go looking for a fight.

49:59.287 --> 50:02.189
Neither do I.
But I'm in one.

50:02.223 --> 50:03.824
That's your bad luck.

50:03.859 --> 50:05.726
And next time
it'll be yours, Mr. Lonergan.

50:05.760 --> 50:08.695
Or Bill's.
Or Frank's.

50:08.730 --> 50:10.364
And if you weren't
already thinking that,

50:10.398 --> 50:12.099
you wouldn't have
come here tonight.

50:13.669 --> 50:16.471
Italians, Irish, Jews...

50:16.505 --> 50:18.373
we could be at
each other's throats,

50:18.407 --> 50:22.810
or we could set rules here

50:22.844 --> 50:25.246
that we can all prosper by

50:25.280 --> 50:27.982
now and forever.

50:29.385 --> 50:30.985
How would we work that?

50:31.019 --> 50:34.889
Joe Masseria
is backing Gyp Rosetti

50:34.923 --> 50:38.392
to steal what I've built,

50:38.427 --> 50:41.696
what I've struggled for
on the steps of my own home.

50:41.730 --> 50:44.799
I'm going to fight him.

50:44.833 --> 50:47.035
I'm going to win.

50:48.971 --> 50:50.672
I need your help.

50:50.706 --> 50:52.774
In exchange,

50:52.808 --> 50:55.543
I'll be proud to call
every one of you

50:55.578 --> 50:58.212
my partner.

51:11.593 --> 51:15.596
Those present
accepted your invitation

51:15.631 --> 51:17.965
out of respect
for our past dealings

51:18.000 --> 51:22.069
<i>and to show</i>
<i>our genuine concern</i>

51:22.103 --> 51:23.504
<i>for your well-being.</i>

51:23.538 --> 51:26.874
<i>( high-pitched ringing )</i>

51:26.908 --> 51:29.277
What does that
mean, Arnold?

51:29.311 --> 51:33.547
It means everyone here wishes you

51:33.582 --> 51:36.350
all the luck in the world.

51:42.724 --> 51:44.858
You won't back me?

51:46.527 --> 51:48.461
Is that what he
persuaded you to do?

51:48.495 --> 51:51.130
- It didn't take persuading.
- I warned you.

51:51.164 --> 51:54.233
<i>You wouldn't listen.</i>
<i>Now look where we are.</i>

51:54.267 --> 51:55.901
What did you tell them?

51:59.638 --> 52:02.006
That business with you

52:02.041 --> 52:04.409
is more trouble
than it's worth.

52:04.477 --> 52:08.480
You're letting emotions
get in the way of sense.

52:08.548 --> 52:11.149
Have you known that
to be a habit of mine?

52:17.389 --> 52:19.624
Charlie, Meyer.

52:20.993 --> 52:23.161
No need
to spend the night.

52:25.598 --> 52:27.800
I won't forget this.

52:29.870 --> 52:33.406
Do you hear me, Arnold?
I will not forget.

52:34.375 --> 52:36.810
Arnold.

52:36.844 --> 52:40.180
Arnold.

52:40.215 --> 52:42.049
Arnold!

52:44.118 --> 52:46.320
Arnold!
