02:03.458 --> 02:04.858

I'm getting a lot of
abnormal interference.

02:15.511 --> 02:17.430
<i>What the devil is that?</i>

02:17.639 --> 02:19.557
Increase it to 20

02:19.766 --> 02:20.850
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

02:25.563 --> 02:27.106
That's an asteroid.

02:27.315 --> 02:28.566
Check it out, quick.

02:30.026 --> 02:31.235
Freeze it on the video.

02:36.991 --> 02:38.431
Have you got that
course figured yet?

02:38.576 --> 02:39.661

02:42.246 --> 02:44.332

General, here's
the final answer.

04:02.577 --> 04:04.120
Now, this confirms
my first guess.

04:04.328 --> 04:06.914
The only answer's to blast
that thing out of the sky.

04:07.123 --> 04:09.043
We'll never make it, Chief.
It's coming too fast.

04:09.083 --> 04:10.543
We'll just have to move faster.

04:14.005 --> 04:15.089
- General?
- Yes.

04:15.298 --> 04:16.498
Commander Rankin is here, sir.

04:16.591 --> 04:18.009
Send him into
my private office.

04:18.216 --> 04:20.094
- What's Rankin doing here?
- I sent for him.

04:20.303 --> 04:21.678
But he's tendered
his resignation.

04:21.887 --> 04:23.264
You can't send
him on a mission

04:23.473 --> 04:26.058
where chances of survival
are zero, and you know it.

04:26.267 --> 04:28.102
He's still the top
officer of my command.

04:28.311 --> 04:30.104
I'd have absolute
confidence in him

04:30.313 --> 04:31.981
no matter what
we're faced with.

04:32.190 --> 04:34.390
And I'll be go to hell if
I know what we are faced with.

04:47.872 --> 04:49.999
How are you, Chief?
It's been a while.

04:50.208 --> 04:51.793
Not bad, still putting
on little weight.

04:52.001 --> 04:53.044
So I see.

04:53.252 --> 04:54.378
Rankin and Elliott...

04:56.172 --> 04:57.882
Best space team we ever had.

04:58.090 --> 05:00.802
Yeah, Vince and I
did pretty well for a while

05:01.010 --> 05:02.220
till I ruined it.

05:02.428 --> 05:04.013
No one's ever
accused you of that

05:04.222 --> 05:05.264
except yourself.

05:05.473 --> 05:06.933
No, not officially.

05:07.141 --> 05:08.726
But what's on your mind?

05:08.935 --> 05:12.313
You didn't ask me over here
to discuss my personal problems.

05:12.522 --> 05:13.856
That's right.

05:15.274 --> 05:16.692
Take a look.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.737
This is the asteroid Flora.

05:19.946 --> 05:22.615
We sighted it moving towards
earth less than two hours ago.

05:22.824 --> 05:25.159
- How did it get out of orbit?
- We don't know.

05:25.368 --> 05:27.203
At this juncture,
I don't care.

05:29.914 --> 05:31.332
Now, here's Flora.

05:31.541 --> 05:33.918
And here we are, the earth.

05:34.126 --> 05:36.170
Flora, that's a
class two asteroid.

05:36.379 --> 05:40.174
Right, close to six
million tons of rock.

05:40.383 --> 05:42.093
And at 7 o'clock
tomorrow morning...

05:42.301 --> 05:44.136
...it'll collide with earth.

05:45.429 --> 05:46.722
That's less than ten hours.

05:46.931 --> 05:48.724
That's right.
Ten hours.

05:48.933 --> 05:51.269
Well, can't it be diverted?
Set up a force shield?

05:51.477 --> 05:52.877
We've run her through
comp analysis.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.063
There's only
one solution.

05:54.272 --> 05:55.314
And?

05:55.523 --> 05:57.358
I think you know
what it is.

05:57.567 --> 05:59.151
That means blast it.

05:59.360 --> 06:01.612
Three trimegaton units
placed on that thing...

06:01.821 --> 06:03.865
And there'll be
nothing left but dust.

06:04.073 --> 06:05.658
Who's in command
of the mission?

06:05.867 --> 06:09.412
To my mind, there's only one man
with the necessary experience.

06:09.620 --> 06:11.581
But under the circumstances,
he would...

06:12.707 --> 06:14.542
...have to volunteer.

06:18.296 --> 06:20.631
I take it
I'm the volunteer?

06:20.840 --> 06:22.216
Here are the
operating orders

06:22.425 --> 06:24.343
and there's a flight
waiting at Lowry Field.

06:29.181 --> 06:30.933
Your operating base
will be Gamma 3.

06:31.142 --> 06:32.982
Everything you need will
be assembled up there.

06:33.185 --> 06:34.520
You don't have
time to waste.

06:34.729 --> 06:36.063
And if I don't make it?

06:36.272 --> 06:37.857
Then don't come
back down.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.568
Because there won't be
anything to come back down to.

06:40.776 --> 06:44.113
Jack, you know what your chances
are about running that blast.

06:44.322 --> 06:45.865
Yeah, I know.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.409
You'll be in full operational
charge of Gamma 3

06:48.618 --> 06:50.745
and the mission
until it's completed.

06:50.953 --> 06:53.998
Presently, Gamma 3 is
commanded by Vince Elliott.

06:55.833 --> 06:57.043
Elliott, huh?

06:58.586 --> 07:00.713
I guess today
is my lucky day.

07:01.422 --> 07:02.422
Jack?

07:03.507 --> 07:04.507
Good luck.

07:27.031 --> 07:28.783
- Good luck.
- I'll do my best.

07:37.917 --> 07:40.211
I'll see what I can do
about the promotion.

09:04.336 --> 09:06.213
Commander, we just passed
through zero gravity.

09:06.422 --> 09:08.507
Right. What's our ETA?

09:08.716 --> 09:11.218
<i>We're due to dock
in 30 minutes and 11 seconds.</i>

09:31.072 --> 09:33.574
Commander Elliott, the cruiser
is in the approach beam.

09:33.783 --> 09:35.493
Thank you very much.
That's all.

09:48.297 --> 09:50.537
Martin, I want that ship brought
in like a crate of eggs.

09:50.633 --> 09:53.427
Right. Commander, the talk is
that Jack Rankin's coming up.

09:53.636 --> 09:55.304
That's right,
he's on that ship.

09:55.513 --> 09:57.348
Does that mean
that he takes over?

09:57.556 --> 09:59.225
That's exactly
what it means.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.018
Now since that's
the way it is

10:01.227 --> 10:03.312
Let's be sure that's
the way it is, huh?

10:03.521 --> 10:04.855
Yes, sir.

10:15.324 --> 10:16.367
Vince?

10:22.456 --> 10:24.959
- I've heard.
- You heard what?

10:27.837 --> 10:29.213
They're sending Jack Rankin up.

10:29.421 --> 10:31.048
Why, it's your command.

10:31.257 --> 10:34.343
I guess chief figures he's
the best man for it, that's all.

10:34.552 --> 10:36.637
I don't believe it. There
must be another reason.

10:36.846 --> 10:38.472
Oh, he'll get the
job done, alright

10:38.681 --> 10:41.016
with no ifs, ands, or buts.
In spite of anything.

10:41.225 --> 10:42.226
Or anybody.

10:43.018 --> 10:44.895
You won't be going
with him, will you?

10:48.607 --> 10:49.984
That's up to him.

10:50.192 --> 10:52.862
Vince, don't let
anything start up again.

10:53.070 --> 10:54.613
That's up to him, too.

10:54.822 --> 10:58.075
Try to remember that once
you were the best of friends.

10:58.284 --> 11:00.327
Alright, Lisa, I'll try
to remember, alright?

11:00.536 --> 11:02.246
And listen, darling.

11:02.413 --> 11:05.207
You don't have the slightest
reason to be jealous of him.

11:05.416 --> 11:07.626
He doesn't mean
anything to me anymore.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.670
You sure?

11:11.005 --> 11:12.006
Alright.

11:14.633 --> 11:17.011
Would you like to join
the welcoming community, hmm?

11:18.554 --> 11:22.099
I told him I never wanted to
see him again. I still mean it.

12:56.860 --> 12:58.070
Commander?

12:59.697 --> 13:01.740
Good to see you again,
Vince. It's been a while.

13:01.949 --> 13:04.410
Welcome aboard, sir. You're
right on schedule. So are we.

13:04.618 --> 13:07.204
Think you can get me loaded
and off in 20 minutes?

13:07.413 --> 13:08.455
No sweat.

13:08.664 --> 13:10.374
I'm Hans Halvorsen, Commander.

13:10.582 --> 13:12.126
- Station's space consultant.
- Good evening.

13:12.334 --> 13:14.670
This is Michaels, my assistant.
We'll be going with you.

13:14.878 --> 13:17.006
I'm sorry, Doctor, you're not
included in my orders

13:17.214 --> 13:18.757
and I can't be held up.

13:18.966 --> 13:21.927
Excuse me, sir, but your orders
were modified a short while ago.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.516
In that case, we leave
in 20 minutes.

13:27.725 --> 13:29.810
- I won't be in the way.
- I hope not.

13:30.019 --> 13:32.104
With your permission, sir,
I'd like to go along.

13:32.313 --> 13:34.648
But your place is here,
Vince, and you know it.

13:34.857 --> 13:36.692
Captain Martin is capable
of taking over, Sir.

13:36.900 --> 13:38.527
One hundred percent.

13:39.653 --> 13:41.030
I'm glad you feel that way.

13:41.238 --> 13:42.281
Consider yourself in.

13:56.211 --> 13:57.838
What the hell are
they waiting for?

13:58.047 --> 14:00.007
They've only been
there five minutes.

14:00.674 --> 14:02.593
They damn well better
get a move on.

15:00.943 --> 15:02.820
Launching area, all clear.

15:03.028 --> 15:04.488
Guidance system
checkout, stand by.

15:04.696 --> 15:05.856
<i>Standing by.</i>

15:05.989 --> 15:07.074
Gyro regulator?

15:07.282 --> 15:08.617
<i>Gyro regulator on and running.</i>

15:08.826 --> 15:09.993
Iron drive?

15:10.202 --> 15:11.912
<i>Iron drive on standby.</i>

15:12.121 --> 15:13.956
Depressurizing launch area.

15:17.334 --> 15:18.544
Zero pressure.

15:18.752 --> 15:20.087
Open main hatch.

16:58.769 --> 17:01.438
Here's where the number
one unit will operate.

17:01.647 --> 17:03.327
That'll be you,
Sergeant Scott, and myself.

17:03.440 --> 17:04.775
Yes, sir.

17:04.983 --> 17:07.236
Takes us to the number two
position, will you.

17:16.203 --> 17:19.915
Number two unit, that'll
be your party, Vince.

17:20.123 --> 17:21.583
Work here.

17:21.791 --> 17:24.877
Lt. Morris, you'll be
in charge of third group

17:25.087 --> 17:28.632
working at the landing area
directly from the ship.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.676
Are there any
questions, gentlemen?

17:32.427 --> 17:33.804
Take her in.

18:20.809 --> 18:22.686
Everybody reading
me loud and clear?

18:25.022 --> 18:26.982
It's 1:53.

18:27.190 --> 18:30.110
Deadline for rendezvous
with the ship is 2:45.

18:31.236 --> 18:32.529
Any questions?

18:32.738 --> 18:33.947
No, Commander.

18:34.156 --> 18:35.949
Let's move.

18:50.422 --> 18:51.673
Come on, lads.

18:51.882 --> 18:52.924
Little faster.

18:53.133 --> 18:55.093
Little faster.

19:03.185 --> 19:05.187
This place looks
as good as any.

22:47.367 --> 22:49.244
That does it,
let's go.

22:55.876 --> 22:57.586
It won't start.

23:03.133 --> 23:05.635
- What is it?
- I don't know.

23:15.770 --> 23:18.648
Let's go, Sergeant.
We'll have to abandon the equipment.

23:39.252 --> 23:40.712
Where's Elliott?

23:40.921 --> 23:42.714
- He isn't back yet.
- Oh, that's great.

23:42.923 --> 23:44.966
Look, here he comes now.

23:48.178 --> 23:50.178
<i>Space central to Commander Rankin.</i>

23:53.767 --> 23:55.810
<i>Space central to Commander Rankin.</i>

23:57.228 --> 23:58.688
This is Rankin, go ahead.

23:58.897 --> 24:01.858
Jack, that damn thing
you're on is accelerating.

24:02.067 --> 24:04.152
- Do you hear me?
- I read you.

24:04.361 --> 24:06.821
Detonation time has to be
moved up to 3 o'clock.

24:07.030 --> 24:09.866
It's 2:40 now. We can't
possibly outrun the blast.

24:10.075 --> 24:11.284
There's no alternative.

24:11.493 --> 24:12.869
Do you realize what
you're asking?

24:13.078 --> 24:14.579
I realize what I'm asking.

24:15.330 --> 24:17.165
<i>3 o'clock.</i>

24:19.334 --> 24:20.752
3 o'clock.

24:29.594 --> 24:32.013
Detonation hour has
been changed to 3 o'clock.

24:32.222 --> 24:33.974
- That's impossible.
- That's what I said.

24:34.182 --> 24:36.476
Change the device and
get everybody on board.

24:37.560 --> 24:38.812
Where the hell is Halvorsen?

24:39.020 --> 24:40.689
I don't know.

24:54.911 --> 24:56.204
Get everybody on board.

24:56.413 --> 24:57.998
You're gonna give him
a few minutes?

24:58.206 --> 25:00.126
- There isn't time...
- You can't leave him here!

25:00.250 --> 25:02.502
You made this mistake
once before.

25:02.711 --> 25:04.004
Commander?

25:04.212 --> 25:05.588
Commander Rankin.

25:06.840 --> 25:08.560
Look, it's pulsating.
It's alive.

25:08.675 --> 25:09.676
Get rid of it.

25:09.884 --> 25:11.386
But this is
a major discovery.

25:14.347 --> 25:15.932
You can't bring it with you!

25:16.141 --> 25:18.977
Now everybody, get on board!

25:44.794 --> 25:46.087
They finally got off.

25:46.296 --> 25:47.922
But they'll never
outrun that blast.

25:49.966 --> 25:52.969
They got away alright, but
they've only got three minutes

25:53.178 --> 25:54.596
to outrun that blast.

26:06.733 --> 26:08.985
Pour it on, Morris. Give
it everything she's got.

26:09.194 --> 26:10.695
She'll break up!

26:11.738 --> 26:15.533
We're over ten G's now.
We can't take much more.

26:15.742 --> 26:17.869
I said increase the speed.

26:51.528 --> 26:53.154
Activate the force shield.

28:14.736 --> 28:16.571
They got through!
They got through!

28:22.535 --> 28:24.245
They made it!

28:36.966 --> 28:39.344
You better notify
the news media.

28:39.552 --> 28:42.222
Fireworks over the city
will need some explaining.

29:09.707 --> 29:10.959
Congratulations, sir.

29:11.167 --> 29:12.607
You really gave us
a hell of a scare.

29:21.135 --> 29:23.137
Thanks Martin, and
thanks to all of you

29:23.346 --> 29:26.266
for the welcoming committee,
but the job isn't over yet.

29:27.433 --> 29:28.518
Vince.

29:30.395 --> 29:32.230
Lizzie, you shouldn't be here.

29:32.438 --> 29:34.274
We haven't been
through decontamination.

29:38.569 --> 29:40.154
Doctor.

29:40.363 --> 29:42.031
I'm holding you responsible
for the decontamination

29:42.240 --> 29:44.117
of material and personnel
used on the mission.

29:44.325 --> 29:46.119
I'm familiar
with the regulations...

29:46.327 --> 29:48.997
I didn't say you weren't,
I'd like them run three times.

29:49.205 --> 29:50.748
Just a minute, Doctor.

29:50.957 --> 29:52.957
Three times? I can't spare
the equipment that long.

29:53.126 --> 29:54.566
I've gotta run this station.

29:54.711 --> 29:56.337
I said three times, Doctor.

29:56.546 --> 29:58.798
The crew have got more
important things to do.

29:59.007 --> 30:00.925
The command reverts to
you when the mission

30:01.134 --> 30:04.345
is completed, and I leave.
That's the way the orders read.

30:04.554 --> 30:07.390
I suggest you bone up
on your regulations.

30:42.425 --> 30:44.093
You should have
one of the doctors

30:44.302 --> 30:45.595
look at that arm, Commander.

30:45.803 --> 30:47.638
Yeah, that's my next stop.

30:50.099 --> 30:51.434
Oh, Morris.

30:53.269 --> 30:55.063
When you file the report,
file it in my name

30:55.271 --> 30:57.315
and Commander Elliot's, okay?

30:57.523 --> 30:59.359
Oh, I understand, Sir.

31:04.822 --> 31:06.199
Oh, Commander!

31:06.407 --> 31:07.825
I'll get a doctor
right away.

31:08.034 --> 31:09.369
Don't bother.

31:20.338 --> 31:22.548
<i>Please be seated, Commander.</i>

31:55.039 --> 31:56.207
Ow!

31:56.416 --> 31:57.667
Take it easy, Doctor.

31:57.875 --> 31:59.585
I'm so sorry, Commander.

31:59.794 --> 32:02.130
You look as
though you're sorry.

32:02.338 --> 32:04.257
It's not half of what
you deserve, Jack.

32:06.134 --> 32:07.510
You're very kind.

32:07.718 --> 32:09.846
You drop me, get engaged
to my best friend

32:10.054 --> 32:11.889
and you still think
I deserve more.

32:12.098 --> 32:14.016
I saw your display just now.

32:14.225 --> 32:16.352
Do you have to be
so tough on everybody?

32:16.561 --> 32:18.354
So sorry.

32:18.563 --> 32:21.941
Nothing to do with being tough.
I get an order, I carry it out.

32:22.150 --> 32:24.735
I give one, I expect the
same, right down the line.

32:24.944 --> 32:26.404
That's your trouble.

32:26.612 --> 32:28.739
There's no margin to let
other people be wrong.

32:28.948 --> 32:31.159
To fail sometimes.

32:31.367 --> 32:32.869
Yeah, I think that's right.

32:33.828 --> 32:36.414
That's why every time
we met, we quarreled.

32:36.622 --> 32:38.374
Be careful, we'll start again.

32:39.292 --> 32:42.211
No, I have no reason
to quarrel with you.

32:42.420 --> 32:44.589
It's finished.
It's all finished between us.

32:48.259 --> 32:49.552
I wonder.

32:49.760 --> 32:51.554
You have an incredible ego.

32:51.762 --> 32:53.681
Lisa, it's got nothing
to do with ego.

32:53.890 --> 32:55.725
Look, Jack, Vince and I have...

32:57.518 --> 33:00.188
Just don't upset things
between us, alright?

33:00.396 --> 33:02.148
Uh, excuse me, Commander?

33:02.982 --> 33:05.526
Your circuit to
space central, it's ready.

33:05.735 --> 33:07.028
Thanks.

33:07.236 --> 33:09.113
And thanks for taking
care of me, Doctor.

33:09.322 --> 33:10.656
Anytime.

33:28.716 --> 33:31.677
May I have your
attention, everybody?

33:31.886 --> 33:33.304
Here's to Flora.

33:33.513 --> 33:36.724
And to your safe return
to earth, Commander.

33:40.311 --> 33:42.188
Sit this one out.

34:04.585 --> 34:06.587
Jack, how is JB?

34:07.630 --> 34:09.422
Oh, he's about as
bad-tempered as ever.

34:09.632 --> 34:10.800
Oh, that's not true.

34:11.007 --> 34:12.842
You know there is
nobody in this world

34:13.052 --> 34:14.469
who cares more about you.

34:14.679 --> 34:16.514
I guess you're right.
By the way, Vince

34:16.722 --> 34:18.599
the old man sends
his very best regards

34:18.808 --> 34:20.434
in his own inimitable way.

34:20.643 --> 34:21.643
Thank you.

34:21.811 --> 34:24.355
He will be glad
to hear Lisa and I

34:24.563 --> 34:26.190
are gonna to be
married next week.

34:26.399 --> 34:28.234
You can tell him personally.

34:32.989 --> 34:34.864
Congratulations.
I'll tell him.

34:36.367 --> 34:38.244
Lisa, I wish you
every happiness.

34:45.793 --> 34:48.629
Commander, may I... dance
with your fiancee?

34:49.797 --> 34:51.172
Please do.

34:53.092 --> 34:54.467
I got it.

36:13.047 --> 36:14.048
Jack.

36:15.383 --> 36:17.259
Try to remember
I'm engaged.

36:21.389 --> 36:23.849
Why can't you and Vince
forget what happened?

36:24.058 --> 36:27.520
He's the one carrying the
grudge. I've done all I could.

36:27.728 --> 36:30.856
Well, you didn't have to report
him so he had to face enquiry.

36:31.065 --> 36:33.401
Yeah, but we both know
the report was true.

36:33.609 --> 36:35.444
He's a nice guy, Lisa.
The problem is

36:35.611 --> 36:37.530
he's too nice to be
a commanding officer.

36:37.738 --> 36:41.033
Was it a mistake not to
sacrifice one of his own men.

36:41.242 --> 36:42.827
You would have done
exactly the same.

36:43.035 --> 36:45.996
I doubt it. And If I had,
I wouldn't bitch about it.

36:46.205 --> 36:49.208
After all, he sacrificed
10 men to save one.

36:49.417 --> 36:51.127
That's a pretty
stupid mistake.

36:52.294 --> 36:54.880
And don't think it hasn't
almost destroyed him.

36:55.089 --> 36:56.089
It's killing him.

36:56.215 --> 36:58.050
And you haven't helped any.

37:07.351 --> 37:09.145
You're making
a big mistake, Lisa.

37:09.353 --> 37:11.355
You don't love Vince,
you pity him.

37:11.564 --> 37:12.982
I'm very happy with him.

37:13.190 --> 37:14.525
You're lying.

37:14.734 --> 37:16.777
You love me.

37:16.986 --> 37:20.406
I told you you had an incredible
ego, but it's more than that.

37:20.614 --> 37:23.117
It's-it's unbelievable.

37:23.325 --> 37:24.785
Excuse me.

37:50.936 --> 37:52.480
Oh, my God.

37:56.942 --> 37:58.903
A-a-ah!

38:03.991 --> 38:05.910
There's trouble, sir.
In the lab.

38:06.118 --> 38:07.828
What kind of trouble?

38:08.037 --> 38:09.622
I think you'd better come, sir.

38:09.830 --> 38:12.190
Alright, follow me.
Rest of you, stay here. We'll handle it.

38:20.841 --> 38:22.218
This way, sir.

38:25.971 --> 38:27.306
Over there.

38:38.025 --> 38:39.235
He's dead.

38:39.443 --> 38:41.278
He put up a hell of a fight.

38:41.487 --> 38:43.155
He's been electrocuted.

38:43.364 --> 38:44.615
Electrocuted?

38:44.824 --> 38:46.909
Then why is that room torn up?

38:47.117 --> 38:48.369
Look at this.

38:51.997 --> 38:54.708
It looks like the same substance
we found on the asteroid

38:54.917 --> 38:55.960
but it isn't moving.

38:56.168 --> 38:57.837
Well, what's it doing
here, Doctor?

38:58.045 --> 38:59.255
I don't know.

38:59.463 --> 39:01.882
It's your responsibility,
Halvorsen.

39:02.091 --> 39:04.426
Set up a search detail,
see what you turn up.

39:04.635 --> 39:05.761
Right.

39:13.811 --> 39:15.938
Unit 6, continue search in A block.

39:16.146 --> 39:17.731
<i>Unit 6, roger.</i>

39:17.940 --> 39:19.775
<i>This is unit 8.</i>

39:19.984 --> 39:21.819
Command room to search unit 3

39:22.027 --> 39:23.863
Command room to Unit 8, roger

39:24.071 --> 39:25.447
Roger.

39:25.656 --> 39:27.741
Command room to search unit 4.
Report your position.

39:27.950 --> 39:30.077
<i>Unit 4 in area 75.</i>

39:30.286 --> 39:34.206
Car 44, report to Lieutenant Dreger
at J-22 in D-block.

39:36.292 --> 39:38.752
- What's wrong with your screen?
- I don't know, sir.

39:38.961 --> 39:40.881
Command room to
electronic maintenance.

39:41.046 --> 39:43.883
Run a check on the power
line terminal in C block.

40:34.725 --> 40:36.518
Ah, ah, ah!

40:36.727 --> 40:38.520
Ah, a-a-ah!

40:48.113 --> 40:51.408
<i>Commander Elliot, come to
C block power terminal, now.</i>

40:58.123 --> 40:59.500
In there, sir.

41:12.388 --> 41:14.264
We found him here, sir.

41:23.691 --> 41:25.109
He's been electrocuted.

41:25.317 --> 41:27.194
Just like Michaels.

41:27.403 --> 41:29.279
<i>Emergency call to Commander Elliot</i>

41:29.488 --> 41:31.740
<i>Come to the main
power room at once.</i>

41:38.580 --> 41:40.916
We found something
strange up there, sir.

41:55.597 --> 41:57.182
You think that's what
killed Michaels?

41:57.391 --> 41:58.475
I don't know.

41:59.476 --> 42:01.186
Let me have that laser.

42:14.324 --> 42:15.701
Stop!

42:15.909 --> 42:17.119
Don't kill it.

42:17.327 --> 42:18.954
Try to save it.

42:19.163 --> 42:21.163
It's a magnificent discovery.
We must do everything

42:21.248 --> 42:22.916
to capture it.

42:23.125 --> 42:26.003
- I think we ought to try.
- It's already killed two men.

42:26.211 --> 42:27.796
Get rid of it.

42:28.005 --> 42:30.966
And as commander of this
station, I say we ought to try.

42:31.175 --> 42:33.802
I'll take full
responsibility for it.

42:34.011 --> 42:35.763
Alright, Vince,
let's do it your way.

42:35.971 --> 42:38.390
Thank you very much.
Now, what do you suggest, Doctor?

42:38.599 --> 42:41.810
Well, let's try to paralyze it.
Get a gas gun and a net.

42:43.062 --> 42:44.063
Alright.

42:44.271 --> 42:45.647
- Lieutenant Curtis.
- Sir?

42:45.856 --> 42:47.524
Take a group of men around
the other side of that reactor.

42:47.733 --> 42:48.901
Yes, sir.

42:49.109 --> 42:50.235
- Lieutenant Morris.
- Yes.

42:50.444 --> 42:52.488
I want a gas gun and a net.

42:52.654 --> 42:53.739
Right.

43:05.125 --> 43:06.585
Ready with the gas gun, sir.

43:06.794 --> 43:08.587
Right, ready aim.

43:08.796 --> 43:10.005
Fire!

43:15.010 --> 43:16.887
Alright, stand by
with the net guns.

43:28.023 --> 43:29.066
Fire!

43:57.803 --> 43:59.054
A-ah!

44:11.024 --> 44:12.985
A-a-ah!

44:18.323 --> 44:20.534
Ah, a-a-ah!

44:33.130 --> 44:35.048
Is there another way
out of this corridor?

44:35.257 --> 44:38.218
No, sir. It's a dead end.
Only ventilation shaft's down there.

44:50.355 --> 44:52.858
Suppose we try it my way now, Vince.

44:53.066 --> 44:54.693
Now on, I'm in command, Martin.

44:54.902 --> 44:58.447
The order is fire at will. Use
discretion, double the guards.

44:58.655 --> 45:00.032
Yes, sir.

45:00.240 --> 45:02.451
You better get down
to the infirmary.

45:07.581 --> 45:08.957
Let's go.

45:10.083 --> 45:11.460
I'm sorry, Commander.

45:31.563 --> 45:32.981
Hurry.

45:33.190 --> 45:34.441
You were lucky.

45:34.650 --> 45:35.692
You think so, huh?

45:35.901 --> 45:38.195
Are you blaming
yourself again?

45:38.403 --> 45:39.738
How's the shoulder?

45:41.281 --> 45:43.283
It's going to be
alright, thanks.

45:43.492 --> 45:45.619
I've decided to hang
around until we find out

45:45.827 --> 45:47.287
what we're really up against.

45:48.580 --> 45:50.624
I appreciate that,
but I can handle it.

45:50.832 --> 45:52.334
I didn't say you couldn't.

45:52.542 --> 45:54.586
I'll feel better if I
know everything's alright.

45:54.795 --> 45:56.922
This is my command, I'll manage it.
Your orders...

45:57.130 --> 45:59.049
I know what the
orders read, Vince.

45:59.258 --> 46:02.386
What do you want me to do?
Pull rank on you, forget it.

46:02.594 --> 46:03.929
Wait. Why should I?

46:04.137 --> 46:06.139
You're saying I always
screw up, right?

46:06.348 --> 46:08.348
Admit it, you're saying,
what happened this morning

46:08.392 --> 46:09.977
it's my fault, right?

46:10.185 --> 46:12.896
Alright, you want it straight.
You make too many mistakes.

46:13.105 --> 46:15.315
You're not right
for command. Satisfied?

46:15.524 --> 46:19.027
Jack, do you realize this is
the first time anything living

46:19.236 --> 46:20.904
has been found
anywhere in space.

46:21.113 --> 46:23.031
Do you know how terribly
important that is?

46:23.240 --> 46:25.909
Tell that to the wives of
the men in the morgue.

46:38.171 --> 46:39.339
Now!

46:46.763 --> 46:50.017
This is monitor 2.
C block all clear.

46:58.984 --> 47:00.861
- Area is all secure.
- Right.

47:02.821 --> 47:05.198
Command room, launching
area, all clear.

47:07.492 --> 47:10.454
<i>This is monitor 6,
D block is all clear.</i>

47:15.000 --> 47:16.960
How's everything going on
outside, Captain Martin?

47:17.127 --> 47:19.367
The men are just getting ready
to got out there now, sir.

47:37.981 --> 47:39.232
Command room.

47:39.441 --> 47:42.110
Yes.
Right.

47:42.319 --> 47:44.404
It's Doctor Halverson.
He's got something to show you in the lab.

47:44.613 --> 47:46.031
He says it very important.

47:48.742 --> 47:52.537
- We better see what he's up to.
- He'll be right there.

48:02.923 --> 48:05.717
Commander, this is the fluid
sample I found in power room.

48:05.926 --> 48:08.887
Despite it's color,
it's obviously blood.

48:09.096 --> 48:11.556
I want you to see
this for yourselves.

48:14.476 --> 48:17.771
These cells duplicate
faster than anything know to man.

48:17.979 --> 48:19.940
Their growth rate is incredible.

48:20.148 --> 48:21.566
In fact, it's frightening.

48:31.618 --> 48:33.620
You realize what this implies?

48:36.706 --> 48:40.585
Do you remember the ripped up
wires in the transmission room?

48:40.794 --> 48:43.255
Come here, I want to
show you something else.

48:47.634 --> 48:50.595
Now, I have a theory as to
why the creature was there

48:50.804 --> 48:52.806
and what it was seeking.

48:53.014 --> 48:54.850
Now, I'm going to send
a controlled charge

48:55.058 --> 48:57.477
to the isolated cells.

49:17.038 --> 49:19.666
The blood cells look like
they're getting larger, Doctor.

49:19.875 --> 49:23.211
Now, I'll increase
the power slightly.

49:50.655 --> 49:52.324
But it proves out.

49:52.532 --> 49:54.659
The animal feeds on energy.

49:54.868 --> 49:56.411
And discharges energy.

49:56.620 --> 49:58.830
That explains its ability
to electrocute Michaels.

49:59.039 --> 50:02.918
One cell, one microscopic
speck left on a spacesuit.

50:03.084 --> 50:05.754
And it would absorb all
the energy it could get.

50:06.588 --> 50:08.006
Wait a minute.

50:08.215 --> 50:12.427
This stuff reproduced inside
the decontamination chamber?

50:12.636 --> 50:16.598
And then as we... as we stepped
up the current, it just...

50:16.806 --> 50:17.974
...it just grew?

50:18.183 --> 50:19.643
Precisely.

50:19.851 --> 50:22.479
These creature can be developing
on any part of the station.

50:22.687 --> 50:26.149
Or a drop of this substance
can reach any form of energy.

50:26.358 --> 50:28.068
Jack.

50:28.276 --> 50:30.070
The power room.
If he's right

50:30.278 --> 50:31.947
those things are
gonna be all over.

50:32.155 --> 50:35.116
I want you to set up a clean-up
detail under Captain Martin.

50:35.325 --> 50:38.328
Re-alert the station, see that
every precaution is taken.

50:38.537 --> 50:40.789
But this order is
revoked, Commander.

50:40.997 --> 50:43.625
Under no circumstances will
the men use their weapons.

50:43.833 --> 50:45.126
Right.

50:50.423 --> 50:53.009
Let's check him
with the analyzer.

51:04.145 --> 51:05.480
It's very strange.

51:12.654 --> 51:13.822
Aah!

51:14.030 --> 51:16.616
Get everybody out,
don't ask any questions.

51:16.825 --> 51:18.451
Get the patients out, hurry.

51:49.608 --> 51:51.818
It's the infirmary.
First squad, come with me.

52:01.369 --> 52:02.787
Come on.

52:02.996 --> 52:04.873
Get back!

52:05.081 --> 52:07.167
Get back, get back, everybody.

52:08.335 --> 52:09.335
Fire!

52:18.595 --> 52:20.472
We've got it now.
Keep firing.

52:23.642 --> 52:24.893
Fire! Fire!

52:25.101 --> 52:27.979
Martin, hold your fire.
Hold your fire, men.

52:28.188 --> 52:29.564
Alright, explain it, Doctor.

52:29.773 --> 52:31.900
Blood cells of this
creature is like a seed.

52:32.108 --> 52:34.653
It can spawn new creatures
from its own blood.

52:37.030 --> 52:38.198
Watch it.

52:39.491 --> 52:40.950
Now!

52:47.082 --> 52:49.459
Maybe, we can trap
it in the ward.

53:06.935 --> 53:08.520
How long will it hold?

53:08.728 --> 53:12.107
We can only guess. Get a man on
the monitor and keep it posted.

53:12.315 --> 53:14.484
Look, more of the
same substance.

53:14.693 --> 53:16.611
Incredible how fast it's growing.

53:24.327 --> 53:26.204
Alright, let's clear
out of here, men.

53:28.289 --> 53:30.875
Bring up that monitor car, quick.

53:31.084 --> 53:32.752
Get the door, Vince.

53:40.468 --> 53:42.345
Get me the isolation ward.

53:52.063 --> 53:53.690
What's it doing?

53:58.778 --> 54:01.281
My God, it can heal itself.

54:01.489 --> 54:03.366
You're saying we can't
kill it, Doctor?

54:03.575 --> 54:05.285
I don't know.

54:05.493 --> 54:07.662
Can you give me a better look
at this side of the room.

54:43.448 --> 54:45.867
It's spreading like wildfire.

54:46.075 --> 54:48.828
It'll soon be all over the
station. Switch to infirmary.

55:07.430 --> 55:09.724
It's almost impossible
to believe.

55:09.933 --> 55:11.184
So fast.

55:13.019 --> 55:14.395
This is Commander Elliot

55:14.604 --> 55:17.065
I want all power in
the infirmary cut off

55:17.273 --> 55:18.525
right now!

55:19.692 --> 55:21.027
Smart move, Vince.

55:22.278 --> 55:26.074
If we can at least keep it
from spreading, we got a chance.

55:26.282 --> 55:27.659
I hope you're right.

55:29.327 --> 55:32.080
Assemble the officers in the
command room in 10 minutes.

55:53.017 --> 55:55.728
Quarantine? Who the hell
does he think he is?

55:58.690 --> 56:00.525
Bring the full report
to my office.

56:00.733 --> 56:02.151
Yes, sir.

56:02.360 --> 56:04.320
Get me an open
circuit to Gamma 3.

56:16.374 --> 56:18.084
Nurse. Two CC of Andrine.

56:22.922 --> 56:24.591
How's the hand?

56:27.010 --> 56:28.094
Jack.

56:28.303 --> 56:30.138
Are we really
in quarantine?

56:33.766 --> 56:36.311
- Are we really in quarantine?
- That's the order.

56:36.519 --> 56:38.021
But what about my patients?

56:38.229 --> 56:40.565
They can't get treatment here.
They should be sent down.

56:40.773 --> 56:42.442
It's absolutely out
of the question.

56:42.650 --> 56:45.278
Lisa, don't you realize if one
drop of the creatures blood

56:45.486 --> 56:48.364
got to the earth, that
would be the end of us all.

56:48.573 --> 56:50.909
Jack, I understand, but it
might be their only chance.

56:51.117 --> 56:53.953
It might be, but nothing
leaves this station.

56:54.162 --> 56:56.247
What is it?

56:56.456 --> 56:57.916
I'm not sure.
I'll find out.

56:58.124 --> 57:00.585
But whatever happens,
keep things under control.

57:10.595 --> 57:11.971
A-a-ah!

57:12.847 --> 57:14.474
A-ah!

57:14.682 --> 57:17.352
- It's alright, don't worry.
- I'm scared.

57:20.146 --> 57:22.357
Alright, gentlemen. May I
have your attention please?

57:22.565 --> 57:25.526
Commander Rankin and I've doped
out a plan we hope will work.

57:25.735 --> 57:27.779
He's on the line with
headquarters right now.

57:27.987 --> 57:29.530
Now, here's what we figured out.

57:29.739 --> 57:32.533
Till now, all our troubles
seemed to be here in C-block.

57:32.742 --> 57:34.410
We've gotta get
everyone out of there.

57:34.619 --> 57:36.120
That'll be rough on the injured.

57:36.329 --> 57:39.958
We got to do it. Get everyone
out of C-block and seal it off.

57:40.166 --> 57:41.751
And then what?

57:41.960 --> 57:44.837
Then we confine it even further.
Right down to the storage room.

57:45.046 --> 57:47.632
But... how do we get
those things in there?

57:47.840 --> 57:49.509
By energy.
We're banking on the fact

57:49.717 --> 57:51.594
that Dr. Halvorsen's
theory is correct.

57:51.803 --> 57:53.972
That these things as you
call them need energy.

57:54.180 --> 57:55.431
Any energy to grow on.

57:55.640 --> 57:57.725
How do we get energy
into the storage room?

57:57.934 --> 58:00.520
Cut off all power
and light in C-block.

58:00.728 --> 58:02.939
We're gonna then run
a power beam search car

58:03.147 --> 58:05.358
down the corridor
stopping at this room.

58:05.566 --> 58:07.652
In the room, we'll set up
a portable generator.

58:07.860 --> 58:09.988
The light beam will
lure them into the room?

58:10.196 --> 58:12.573
We hope right
to the generator.

58:12.782 --> 58:15.994
Well, at least we'll have this
mess contained in one area...

58:16.202 --> 58:17.578
...if it works.

58:17.787 --> 58:19.205
Oh, it's got to work.

58:19.414 --> 58:21.332
Because if these things spread

58:21.541 --> 58:23.710
if they get back to
that main power room...

58:23.918 --> 58:25.128
We've had it.

58:25.336 --> 58:26.587
Right.

58:26.796 --> 58:28.798
Set up the generator
in 10 minutes.

58:29.007 --> 58:30.258
Yes, sir, right away.

58:32.218 --> 58:33.970
<i>This is Commander Rankin.</i>

58:34.178 --> 58:36.889
<i>All personnel will be
evacuated from C-block.</i>

58:37.098 --> 58:39.517
<i>In 10 minutes, all lights
throughout the entire station</i>

58:39.726 --> 58:41.144
<i>will be extinguished.</i>

58:41.352 --> 58:43.688
<i>There will be no alarms, no signals.</i>

58:43.896 --> 58:46.524
<i>Prepare all sick and wounded
for immediate removal</i>

58:46.733 --> 58:49.277
<i>and stand by.</i>

58:49.485 --> 58:50.820
Will everything be alright?

58:51.029 --> 58:52.321
Yes, yes.

59:20.600 --> 59:22.351
Hold up, driver.

59:24.353 --> 59:25.772
This is Commander Rankin.

59:25.980 --> 59:27.565
Are you men set
with the generator?

59:27.774 --> 59:29.484
Yes, Commander.
We're all set here.

59:29.692 --> 59:31.444
Turn on the remote control.

59:31.652 --> 59:33.029
Roger.

59:33.237 --> 59:37.492
I'm activating the
switch as off... now.

59:37.700 --> 59:40.495
It's working, sir.
We're clearing out right now.

01:00:10.525 --> 01:00:12.401
It's almost time.

01:00:36.425 --> 01:00:38.302
Let's have a look
behind us, Martin.

01:00:38.511 --> 01:00:39.804
Yes, sir.

01:01:04.203 --> 01:01:05.538
Here we go, men.

01:01:09.542 --> 01:01:11.085
Don't move.

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:19.760
- You ready, driver?
- Yes, sir.

01:01:19.969 --> 01:01:21.804
Easy, men, easy.

01:01:29.061 --> 01:01:30.438
Let's go.

01:01:40.698 --> 01:01:42.575
Easy, men.

01:01:42.783 --> 01:01:44.118
It's working.

01:02:09.393 --> 01:02:11.229
A-a-ah!

01:02:18.611 --> 01:02:20.613
Kill the lights, men.
Give me that.

01:02:30.331 --> 01:02:32.750
- Move it back.
- Yes, sir.

01:02:46.764 --> 01:02:49.267
Lisa, these things
are gonna follow me.

01:02:49.475 --> 01:02:51.352
When they do, I want
you to get out of here.

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:22.883
Lisa! Now!

01:03:23.092 --> 01:03:24.927
Come on, let's get out of here.

01:03:39.775 --> 01:03:41.277
Come on, hurry.

01:04:00.838 --> 01:04:02.715
Jack!

01:04:02.923 --> 01:04:04.258
I'm behind you!

01:04:04.467 --> 01:04:07.845
Now, douse your lamp.
Let them come to me.

01:04:20.066 --> 01:04:21.942
Martin, get ready
with the lights.

01:04:23.402 --> 01:04:25.738
Elliott, stand clear.

01:04:25.946 --> 01:04:27.281
Come on!

01:04:30.201 --> 01:04:32.078
Move the car, driver.

01:04:50.054 --> 01:04:51.972
Cut the lights.

01:05:07.029 --> 01:05:09.365
- Let's be 100% sure, Martin.
- Yes, sir.

01:05:09.573 --> 01:05:11.450
Send the car
to C-block again.

01:05:11.659 --> 01:05:14.412
Switch on the lights
and turn the car around.

01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:33.097
The one in the isolation ward.

01:05:34.223 --> 01:05:35.599
Monitor car.

01:05:38.102 --> 01:05:39.979
Get the infirmary.

01:05:46.026 --> 01:05:47.319
That door won't hold it.

01:05:47.528 --> 01:05:49.363
We can brace the
door with the car.

01:05:49.572 --> 01:05:50.948
That won't help much, Captain.

01:05:52.116 --> 01:05:54.118
But the airlock panel might.

01:05:57.121 --> 01:05:58.789
We can isolate him in C-block.

01:05:58.998 --> 01:06:01.083
I don't know if the
section can handle it.

01:06:01.292 --> 01:06:02.835
This place is
stronger than that.

01:06:03.419 --> 01:06:05.588
Now, wait a minute.
There must be another way.

01:06:06.547 --> 01:06:08.549
When you think
of it, let me know.

01:06:12.344 --> 01:06:13.929
This is Commander
Rankin speaking.

01:06:14.138 --> 01:06:16.599
Prepare we evacuate
C-block immediately

01:06:16.807 --> 01:06:19.185
and make ready to
drop the airlock panel.

01:06:23.481 --> 01:06:24.690
Alright, come on. Let's go.

01:06:24.899 --> 01:06:26.567
- Move this thing.
- Commander, wait.

01:06:26.775 --> 01:06:29.361
Didn't you hear the order?
What are you doing down here?

01:06:29.570 --> 01:06:31.697
It's my files.
I have to get them out.

01:06:31.906 --> 01:06:33.146
- There isn't time.
- Commander!

01:06:33.199 --> 01:06:35.159
There isn't time.
Halvorsen!

01:06:35.367 --> 01:06:37.453
Martin! Get that
idiot out of here.

01:06:37.661 --> 01:06:38.662
Yes, sir.

01:06:40.498 --> 01:06:42.082
Come on.
Hurry up!

01:06:42.291 --> 01:06:44.168
Douse the light!

01:06:44.376 --> 01:06:46.212
Come on, move.
Move. Move.

01:07:01.685 --> 01:07:02.685
Move!

01:07:14.365 --> 01:07:16.242
Come on, Halvorsen. Hurry up!

01:07:34.843 --> 01:07:37.304
- Everybody get out alright?
- Are you alright?

01:07:37.471 --> 01:07:39.014
Yeah, but I just made it.

01:07:39.223 --> 01:07:42.434
Commander, Dr. Halvorsen
is still inside C-block.

01:07:46.647 --> 01:07:48.274
Help! Help!

01:07:48.482 --> 01:07:50.359
No, no, no.

01:07:50.568 --> 01:07:51.860
A-ah, ah!

01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:53.404
Help! Help! Help!

01:07:53.612 --> 01:07:55.239
Only one way
to get him out.

01:07:55.447 --> 01:07:57.283
We'll have to drop
the other airlock.

01:07:57.491 --> 01:07:59.660
Can't. The light car's
jammed under it. Won't move.

01:07:59.868 --> 01:08:02.538
Come on, men, see
if we can free this car.

01:08:21.724 --> 01:08:24.350
Listen, there's only one way
to get him out of there.

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:26.854
We're gonna have to raise
the first airlock panel.

01:08:27.062 --> 01:08:28.564
You'll risk the whole station.

01:08:28.772 --> 01:08:30.649
That's a risk we're
gonna have to take.

01:08:30.858 --> 01:08:32.693
Not as long as
I'm in command.

01:08:35.154 --> 01:08:38.115
Vince! Get away
from that panel.

01:08:39.742 --> 01:08:41.743
That's an order, Vince.

01:08:52.254 --> 01:08:54.423
It's your move, Commander.

01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:21.450
You're not supposed
to shoot them, Jack.

01:09:21.658 --> 01:09:23.493
Get her out of here.

01:09:43.721 --> 01:09:46.392
- Martin, get the panel.
- Yes, sir.

01:10:13.210 --> 01:10:15.421
There's been an
explosion on Gamma 3.

01:10:21.218 --> 01:10:23.595
- What happened?
- A section just blew out.

01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:29.810
- Put me on radio.
- Right.

01:10:31.687 --> 01:10:33.480
Space Center to Gamma 3.

01:10:33.689 --> 01:10:35.274
Space Center to Gamma 3.

01:10:36.233 --> 01:10:38.068
Space Center to Gamma 3.

01:10:57.212 --> 01:10:58.547
Scanner still
working on C-Block?

01:10:58.756 --> 01:10:59.756
Yes, sir.

01:11:09.641 --> 01:11:10.976
Looks like some of
them have been killed.

01:11:11.185 --> 01:11:12.853
Yeah, but look
how they're burnt.

01:11:13.061 --> 01:11:15.814
Must been tremendous heat
generated by the explosion.

01:11:16.023 --> 01:11:18.358
There are only three or four.
What happened to others?

01:11:18.567 --> 01:11:20.110
Get me an outside scanner.

01:11:27.618 --> 01:11:30.954
Jack, look. A sun.
It's healing them.

01:11:31.163 --> 01:11:32.956
And look at the way
they're growing.

01:11:36.418 --> 01:11:39.963
Main power room.
Shut down the solar generators now.

01:11:42.174 --> 01:11:44.051
Lisa, get all the
injured in B-block.

01:11:44.259 --> 01:11:47.346
Keep them together and be ready
to move in a moment's notice.

01:12:01.735 --> 01:12:03.320
The circuit to
headquarters through yet?

01:12:03.529 --> 01:12:06.782
- In just a few seconds, sir.
- Oh, hurry it up.

01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:08.700
Here we are, sir.

01:12:08.909 --> 01:12:11.787
This is Rankin on Gamma 3.
Do you read me loud and clear, over.

01:12:11.995 --> 01:12:13.622
<i>Loud and clear, sir.</i>

01:12:13.831 --> 01:12:16.333
Urgent priority on this message
to the chief of staff.

01:12:16.542 --> 01:12:20.838
One, necessary to abandon
Gamma 3 immediately.

01:12:21.046 --> 01:12:24.591
Prepare to receive evacuees,
many of whom are wounded.

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:27.928
Absolutely mandatory to
have complete quarantine

01:12:28.136 --> 01:12:30.264
and thorough examination
of all personnel

01:12:30.472 --> 01:12:31.807
and equipment on arrival.

01:12:32.015 --> 01:12:35.894
Two, request permission
to destroy Gamma 3.

01:12:36.103 --> 01:12:38.188
To destroy this station?

01:12:38.397 --> 01:12:40.983
Situation here beyond control.
Further efforts futile.

01:12:41.191 --> 01:12:44.278
Any unnecessary delay can prove
disastrous to entire company.

01:12:44.444 --> 01:12:46.822
You can evacuate this station.
You're not gonna destroy it.

01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:48.198
It's our only way, Vince.

01:12:48.407 --> 01:12:50.325
What do you mean,
"it's our only way"?

01:12:50.534 --> 01:12:52.619
I mean that I want this
place cleared out

01:12:52.786 --> 01:12:57.291
lock, stock, and barrel in 30 minutes.
Is that clear enough?

01:12:57.499 --> 01:12:59.501
- Put me on the loudspeakers.
- Yes, sir.

01:12:59.710 --> 01:13:02.838
This is Commander Rankin.
Now, hear this.

01:13:03.046 --> 01:13:06.758
Now, hear this. This is a
general quarters alert.

01:13:06.967 --> 01:13:10.387
Our personnel will prepare to
evacuate the station at once.

01:13:10.596 --> 01:13:13.473
All support cruisers will be
ready for immediate departure.

01:13:13.682 --> 01:13:15.601
Target deadline
will be in 40...

01:13:17.102 --> 01:13:20.147
Now, I'm going to tell you
something for the last time.

01:13:20.355 --> 01:13:22.858
I am in command
of this station.

01:13:23.066 --> 01:13:26.987
And when my chief gives me
an order to destroy Gamma 3

01:13:27.195 --> 01:13:30.365
I'll take that order from him,
but I won't take it from you.

01:13:35.078 --> 01:13:37.831
Lieutenant Morris, I want you
to escort Commander Elliott

01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:39.666
to the evacuation area.

01:13:39.875 --> 01:13:41.293
Put him on a cruiser.

01:13:41.501 --> 01:13:43.378
If he offers any
resistance of any kind

01:13:43.587 --> 01:13:45.672
consider him under arrest.

01:13:50.469 --> 01:13:54.181
- Commander! Take it easy!
- Alright, alright!

01:13:58.644 --> 01:14:00.354
Lieutenant Morris,
you have your orders.

01:14:00.562 --> 01:14:01.562
Yes, sir.

01:14:03.649 --> 01:14:05.943
Captain Martin, you'll be
in charge of the evacuation.

01:14:06.151 --> 01:14:07.611
Yes, sir.

01:14:14.826 --> 01:14:17.204
Stand by. We've got
them now, sir.

01:14:17.412 --> 01:14:20.624
This is General Thompson.
Can you get everyone off?

01:14:20.832 --> 01:14:23.043
Yes, sir. We'll be clearing
as soon as possible.

01:14:23.251 --> 01:14:25.754
Jack, don't take any
unnecessary chances.

01:14:25.963 --> 01:14:28.465
- We'll handle it from here.
- It's your party.

01:14:34.388 --> 01:14:35.889
Connect me to the
evacuation room.

01:14:36.098 --> 01:14:37.098
Yes, sir.

01:14:39.309 --> 01:14:40.309
Go ahead.

01:14:41.061 --> 01:14:44.064
Lisa, are all your
patients ready to go?

01:14:44.398 --> 01:14:46.733
All patients are
ready for evacuation.

01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:49.152
Alright.

01:14:51.488 --> 01:14:55.659
Doctor, I'm never going
to make it down, am I?

01:14:55.867 --> 01:14:58.745
Of course, you will. Everything
is going to be alright.

01:15:08.255 --> 01:15:11.341
- Captain. We're all set to go.
- Fine, Morris.

01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:13.190
- Open the escape hatch.
- Right, standby.

01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:14.260
Standing by.

01:15:14.386 --> 01:15:16.304
Escape hatch opening.

01:15:20.267 --> 01:15:22.477
- What's wrong?
- It won't open.

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:24.520
Captain!

01:15:28.817 --> 01:15:29.817
Close it, quick.

01:15:29.943 --> 01:15:31.570
Command room,
this is Control.

01:15:31.778 --> 01:15:34.364
They are outside the escape
hatch. We can't get it open.

01:15:34.573 --> 01:15:37.075
<i>Can you hear me?
We can't open the escape hatch.</i>

01:15:37.284 --> 01:15:39.077
- Give me an outside camera.
- Yes, sir.

01:15:42.456 --> 01:15:44.656
They're after the power
circuits on the solar generator.

01:15:44.791 --> 01:15:46.209
They sure are.

01:15:46.418 --> 01:15:49.421
Martin, send four men up there
and blast those things.

01:15:49.629 --> 01:15:51.715
<i>Roger. Right away, sir.</i>

01:16:20.368 --> 01:16:22.245
Alright, Captain.
I'll be handling this myself.

01:16:22.454 --> 01:16:24.664
Make sure everyone is set
to leave the station.

01:16:24.873 --> 01:16:26.958
- But, sir, Commander Rankin...
- That is an order, Captain.

01:16:27.167 --> 01:16:28.752
You do know what
an order is?

01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:30.629
- Yes, sir.
- Vince.

01:16:32.422 --> 01:16:34.299
Vince, don't go out there.

01:16:37.094 --> 01:16:40.514
Don't tell me what to do.
I'm tired of being told what to do.

01:16:40.722 --> 01:16:42.849
I'm tired of taking orders.
This is my station.

01:16:43.016 --> 01:16:45.393
Now, go up there and
tell your GI boy scout

01:16:45.602 --> 01:16:46.645
what I just said.

01:16:46.853 --> 01:16:48.313
- Mine?
- You're damn right.

01:16:48.522 --> 01:16:51.483
It's never been over
between you two, has it?

01:16:51.691 --> 01:16:53.652
Vince, you got it all wrong.
Believe me.

01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:56.196
Sure. Sure, I do.

01:16:56.363 --> 01:16:58.824
<i>Captain Martin, what's keeping you?
Get moving.</i>

01:16:59.032 --> 01:17:00.552
See, the great man's
getting impatient.

01:17:00.742 --> 01:17:02.285
Excuse me.

01:17:02.494 --> 01:17:04.246
We're all set, sir.
Good luck, sir.

01:17:04.454 --> 01:17:05.454
Thank you.

01:17:10.502 --> 01:17:11.502
Don't worry about me.

01:17:11.628 --> 01:17:14.131
You get your patients, your
staff on the cruisers. Hmm?

01:17:20.804 --> 01:17:22.973
Quick! Get them
aboard the cruiser.

01:17:26.059 --> 01:17:28.103
Is Commander Elliott
outside yet?

01:17:28.311 --> 01:17:29.855
Commander Elliott?

01:17:32.399 --> 01:17:34.276
Alright. Let's go.

01:17:53.795 --> 01:17:55.380
That's Commander Elliott.

01:18:11.313 --> 01:18:14.566
I think the solar power supply
can be used as a diversion.

01:18:14.774 --> 01:18:16.276
- Activate it, Curtis.
- Right.

01:18:57.692 --> 01:18:58.944
Get them ready to go.

01:18:59.152 --> 01:19:00.152
- Stand by.
- Standing by.

01:19:00.278 --> 01:19:01.278
Hatches open.

01:19:01.446 --> 01:19:02.781
Get ready to launch number one.

01:19:02.989 --> 01:19:04.157
Ready.

01:19:04.366 --> 01:19:05.366
Hit the blue.

01:19:26.638 --> 01:19:28.598
<i>Number one, off and clear.</i>

01:19:28.807 --> 01:19:30.642
- Ready, number two.
<i>- Ready.</i>

01:19:31.434 --> 01:19:32.434
Hit it!

01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:21.526
Turn off the gyro-computer.

01:20:21.735 --> 01:20:23.278
Roger.

01:20:23.486 --> 01:20:25.905
<i>Martin, how's it going?</i>

01:20:26.114 --> 01:20:27.741
The last group is
leaving now, sir.

01:20:27.949 --> 01:20:29.909
There's only the
security detail left.

01:20:30.118 --> 01:20:31.786
Good work, Martin.
We'll be right there.

01:20:31.995 --> 01:20:34.080
Alright, everybody.
Get down to the evacuation area.

01:20:34.289 --> 01:20:36.458
We'll pick up Elliott and
others in the atmosphere.

01:20:55.226 --> 01:20:57.145
This is Gamma 3
calling Space Central.

01:20:57.354 --> 01:20:59.564
Gamma 3 calling Space Central.

01:20:59.773 --> 01:21:03.109
Guidance control is set.
We are clearing out.

01:21:03.276 --> 01:21:05.070
We are clearing out.

01:21:05.278 --> 01:21:07.947
This is Space Central.
We're taking over now.

01:21:08.156 --> 01:21:10.742
Get ready to test the remote
guidance system for Gamma 3.

01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:12.494
Yes, sir.

01:21:24.255 --> 01:21:26.508
Jack! Behind you!

01:21:44.317 --> 01:21:45.652
Where are the others?

01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:47.445
They're on the cruiser
waiting for you.

01:21:47.654 --> 01:21:48.654
- Come on.
- Commander!

01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:50.281
- More trouble.
- What is it?

01:21:50.490 --> 01:21:52.370
Space Central reports
our power's dropped so low

01:21:52.575 --> 01:21:54.577
they can't activate
guidance by remote control.

01:21:54.786 --> 01:21:55.912
What does that mean?

01:21:57.080 --> 01:21:58.456
It means we do it ourselves.

01:21:58.665 --> 01:21:59.916
That means going back.

01:22:00.125 --> 01:22:01.334
Oh, no.

01:22:01.543 --> 01:22:03.378
Get on that cruiser
and get outta here.

01:22:03.586 --> 01:22:05.171
It's impossible
to go back in there.

01:22:05.380 --> 01:22:06.780
It's useless to
even try, Commander.

01:22:06.923 --> 01:22:08.299
There are too many of them.

01:22:08.508 --> 01:22:10.427
We'd never make
it to the controls.

01:22:10.635 --> 01:22:14.597
We've gotta make it, Martin.
It's as simple as that.

01:22:14.806 --> 01:22:16.433
Yes, sir.
I'll round up a detail.

01:22:16.641 --> 01:22:19.686
Captain. I'm the one
that's going back.

01:22:19.894 --> 01:22:22.605
Take that last cruiser and get
out of here as quick as you can.

01:22:22.814 --> 01:22:24.107
Circle the station.

01:22:24.315 --> 01:22:27.777
I'll, eh, I'll drift up
and meet you later.

01:22:27.986 --> 01:22:29.779
Yes, sir.

01:22:29.988 --> 01:22:32.824
- Jack, why can't...
- Will you stop arguing?

01:22:36.578 --> 01:22:38.455
Please. Don't go.

01:22:42.667 --> 01:22:43.918
I'll be back.

01:23:10.528 --> 01:23:12.447
- Ready for launch.
- Ready.

01:23:50.276 --> 01:23:51.945
Easy now. I'll take it.

01:23:52.153 --> 01:23:53.154
Alright.

01:23:56.950 --> 01:23:58.243
Where's Rankin, Lisa?

01:24:01.287 --> 01:24:03.122
He went back inside.

01:24:03.331 --> 01:24:04.415
Alone.

01:24:31.484 --> 01:24:33.987
Vince, where are you going?

01:24:34.195 --> 01:24:36.030
I'm gonna go help him.

01:25:33.755 --> 01:25:35.089
You never could take orders.

01:25:35.298 --> 01:25:37.383
Everybody's got
his weakness, right?

01:25:51.481 --> 01:25:53.358
That's it. Let's go.

01:26:04.452 --> 01:26:05.662
Vince!

01:26:05.870 --> 01:26:08.164
Ah! A-a-a-ah!

01:26:17.006 --> 01:26:18.006
Vince!

01:27:03.261 --> 01:27:05.179
Pull in close.
Take them aboard.

01:28:17.752 --> 01:28:20.630
Stand by.
The circuit's ready, sir.

01:28:23.132 --> 01:28:24.801
This is Rankin reporting.

01:28:25.009 --> 01:28:27.929
As the result of action above
and beyond the call of duty

01:28:28.137 --> 01:28:29.764
by Commander Vince Elliott,

01:28:29.972 --> 01:28:33.059
<i>evacuation successful
with minimum of casualties.</i>

01:28:33.267 --> 01:28:35.686
