00:19.046 --> 00:21.808
They said it couldn't be done ...

00:21.809 --> 00:27.887
the one called "Arcee" is too quick,
too stealthy to be captured.

00:27.956 --> 00:34.627
Well, here you are, with a rare
opportunity to make history.

00:34.696 --> 00:39.299
You see, I have intercepted this
encrypted Autobot signal,

00:39.367 --> 00:42.635
and if it's encrypted,
it must be important.

00:42.704 --> 00:48.508
Decode it for me, and I will see
to it that you perish quickly.

00:50.745 --> 00:54.614
Speak up. I can't hear
you when you whimper.

00:54.683 --> 00:56.883
Get... fragged.

01:01.022 --> 01:05.123
Perhaps you will be more
inclined to cooperate when it is

01:05.193 --> 01:09.229
not your own well-being at stake.

01:13.134 --> 01:15.535
Arcee.
Been a while.

<i><font color="cyan"> sync & corr. by f1nc0

02:05.741 --> 02:09.276
Give me the encryption code,
or I will add your comrade

02:09.346 --> 02:13.048
Cliffjumper to the multitude
of fallen Autobots below.

02:13.116 --> 02:15.817
Scrap him.
I barely know the guy.

02:15.886 --> 02:18.920
Ouch.
Glad I'm not the sensitive type.

02:23.259 --> 02:29.497
Cybertron is little more than
a graveyard now. Give me the code!

02:29.566 --> 02:32.267
I'm not afraid of you, Starscream.

02:32.268 --> 02:34.069
You're no Megatron.

02:40.833 --> 02:44.769
Three steps, Bulkhead?
That's all you can manage?

02:45.572 --> 02:50.075
I'm sorry, Miko.
My legs still hurt.

02:57.917 --> 03:01.820
- What did I tell you?
- "No excuses."

03:01.889 --> 03:05.490
Exactly. Try again.
10 steps this time.

03:11.230 --> 03:14.533
I hope decoding the Iacon
database is going more smoothly

03:14.601 --> 03:18.637
- than Bulkhead's recovery.
- Slow but steady, old friend.

03:19.907 --> 03:24.476
Human technology.
But your expertise in the field

03:24.545 --> 03:29.147
should provide any edge we need to
beat the Decepticons at this game.

03:29.216 --> 03:32.584
I fear their access to
Cybertronian technology

03:32.653 --> 03:34.953
may provide them
with equal advantage.

03:36.890 --> 03:40.125
Not good enough! You have to
come back stronger than before.

03:41.695 --> 03:43.762
Time for a break, Bulkhead.

03:43.830 --> 03:46.131
A break?
You think the 'Cons are gonna

03:46.199 --> 03:49.134
give Bulkhead a break in the
middle of a fire fight?!

03:49.202 --> 03:52.037
If you push a patient too far too fast,

03:52.038 --> 03:54.873
you risk exacerbating their injuries.

03:54.942 --> 03:57.409
- But ...
- Bulkhead needs to rest.

04:06.485 --> 04:08.353
Out of the way!

04:24.627 --> 04:26.361
Miko?

04:26.430 --> 04:29.798
Oh. Uh... hey, Arcee.
I was just...

04:29.867 --> 04:34.803
- Aren't we a little close to the edge?
- Heights don't scare me.

04:44.181 --> 04:48.283
No offense, but I came up
here for some privacy.

04:48.352 --> 04:50.485
I understand what you're
going through.

04:50.554 --> 04:52.487
If you ever want someone to talk to ...

04:52.556 --> 04:57.193
I'm fine, okay? I'm not the
one Hardshell tried to scrap.

04:58.262 --> 05:01.796
Miko, it's rough when someone
you care about gets hurt.

05:01.865 --> 05:06.635
Closing yourself off from feeling...
won't help anyone.

05:06.703 --> 05:10.805
Well, you would know,
wouldn't you?

05:10.874 --> 05:15.510
Yes... I would.

05:21.918 --> 05:25.620
Arcee, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

05:25.689 --> 05:27.022
It's okay.

05:27.090 --> 05:32.694
He's... been on my mind lately.
After I lost my first partner,

05:32.763 --> 05:37.432
Tailgate, I pushed everyone away,
until Cliffjumper came along.

05:37.501 --> 05:39.301
What was he like?

05:39.369 --> 05:43.238
Cliff was...
quite the conversationalist.

05:49.746 --> 05:51.379
Cliffjumper?
Are you ...

05:52.316 --> 05:58.119
I... I can't... I can't
believe you actually care.

06:00.323 --> 06:03.892
The only thing I care about
is whether you talked just now.

06:05.028 --> 06:08.763
Are you always this nice
to your rescuers?

06:12.468 --> 06:13.902
Didn't answer my question.

06:13.971 --> 06:16.404
I got bored with
Starscream's little workout.

06:16.473 --> 06:20.875
So I idled my engines and faked
shutdown. Scream bought it.

06:20.944 --> 06:22.410
How did you wind up here?

06:22.479 --> 06:26.781
Intercepted some chatter about
a Decepticon operation on the old home planet.

06:26.850 --> 06:29.918
So I follow the trail and find
Starscream shipping massive

06:29.987 --> 06:32.954
amounts of Energon here to Cybertron.

06:33.023 --> 06:36.491
- What's your story?
- Same.

06:36.560 --> 06:39.494
You're quite the
conversationalist.

06:40.464 --> 06:44.599
I've tried every interrogation
technique, and nothing is working.

06:44.668 --> 06:48.970
I would just eliminate them,
but the code they carry is too valuable.

06:49.039 --> 06:53.074
If only I could break them open
and just take it!

06:56.946 --> 07:00.348
No, I will not take the
prisoners to the surface!

07:00.417 --> 07:03.284
Why should I let him
have all the glory?

07:03.353 --> 07:07.156
<i>The code they carry is too valuable.</i>

07:07.724 --> 07:13.161
All right, since I must deliver
the Energon to him anyway...

07:21.103 --> 07:23.738
So, this is Kaon, huh?

07:23.807 --> 07:26.875
Love what you Decepticons
have done with the place.

07:26.943 --> 07:29.277
The ruins are especially picturesque.

07:29.346 --> 07:30.111
Silence!

07:40.856 --> 07:42.724
Here we are.

07:52.268 --> 07:53.601
That's not a good sign.

07:53.670 --> 07:56.188
Since I could not
compel you to surrender

07:56.189 --> 07:58.707
the encryption code,
I'm forced to introduce

07:58.775 --> 08:03.678
you to someone whose methods
are a little more... persuasive.

08:14.924 --> 08:17.659
We may be in a little
more trouble than I thought.

08:17.728 --> 08:22.397
Autobots, say hello to Shockwave.

08:33.313 --> 08:35.341
Delivering a mountain of Energon,

08:35.342 --> 08:38.384
intercepting an encrypted
Autobot communiqÃ©,

08:38.453 --> 08:42.188
and capturing two key prisoners
is impressive, I admit.

08:42.256 --> 08:47.761
But lord Megatron expects nothing
less from his first lieu...

08:48.830 --> 08:50.896
I should let you work, right?

08:52.033 --> 08:56.335
No doubt you are trying
to concentrate. Carry on.

09:11.785 --> 09:16.188
Um, Shockwave, are you certain
you can extract the decryption

09:16.257 --> 09:20.326
code without first nullifying
our subject's neural net?

09:20.395 --> 09:23.496
I invented the cortical
psychic patch.

09:23.564 --> 09:29.135
I am familiar with its idiosyncrasies.

09:30.203 --> 09:33.439
Of course you are.

09:35.476 --> 09:38.311
Keep that thing away from me,
you one-eyed freak!

09:38.379 --> 09:41.480
- Leave her alone! Use it on me!
- Do not worry.

09:41.549 --> 09:46.352
If her mind does not survive the
procedure, you will be next.

09:54.695 --> 09:56.896
Ah. The code.

10:03.204 --> 10:05.055
Arcee. Arcee!

10:05.056 --> 10:06.906
I'll scrap you both!

10:06.974 --> 10:09.742
Shut up!
I'm trying to listen!

10:09.811 --> 10:13.546
<i>This is Optimus Prime.
To all surviving Autobots who</i>

10:13.614 --> 10:17.783
<i>hear this message, I ask you to
join me in a remote corner of</i>

10:17.852 --> 10:21.687
<i>the galaxy, on a small planet
rich with Energon.</i>

10:21.756 --> 10:26.559
<i>I have reason to believe this
world will soon become a new</i>

10:26.627 --> 10:31.897
<i>target of Decepticon conquest.
Our team is small but strong.</i>

10:31.966 --> 10:38.104
<i>Join me at these coordinates so
that we might plan our resistance.</i>

10:38.172 --> 10:40.239
<i>Safe journeys.</i>

10:42.776 --> 10:46.479
Aha! Brilliant!
Not only do we know where to

10:46.547 --> 10:50.149
find Optimus Prime,
but he's begging for help.

10:50.218 --> 10:52.084
Now is the time to strike!

10:55.322 --> 10:58.324
You are no longer of use.

10:59.693 --> 11:01.747
Hey, Scream. Curious ...

11:01.748 --> 11:04.830
you always let other
'Cons do your dirty work?

11:04.899 --> 11:09.702
Shockwave! You already
disposed of one of my prisoners.

11:09.771 --> 11:12.371
Cliffjumper is mine.

11:12.440 --> 11:18.444
Your reasoning is hardly...
logical. But indulge yourself.

11:23.950 --> 11:28.721
What do you think, Cliffjumper?
Plenty to choose from here.

11:29.190 --> 11:33.559
Shall we go with precise
dissection or blunt force?

11:35.996 --> 11:37.096
Your choice, Scream.

11:37.165 --> 11:39.899
Whatever you pick, I'm just
gonna end up using it on you.

11:39.967 --> 11:42.334
Very well.

11:43.970 --> 11:48.407
Why don't we do this
the old-fashioned way?

11:57.050 --> 11:59.051
No! No!!

12:04.991 --> 12:08.394
Thanks for the save.

12:08.763 --> 12:12.398
Your turn, Starscream.
What's with all the Energon?

12:12.467 --> 12:14.233
As if I would tell you!

12:14.302 --> 12:19.104
Talk, or you're a science
experiment. I'm not kidding!

12:23.076 --> 12:25.211
You should probably tell her
something.

12:25.279 --> 12:27.379
I'm not sure how long
I can hold her back.

12:27.448 --> 12:32.818
I'm no expert with this thing, but
I hear one slip-up can fry a neural net.

12:32.887 --> 12:35.754
Shockwave!
He's the one you want!

12:35.823 --> 12:38.424
He's building a space bridge
beneath Kaon.

12:38.493 --> 12:42.661
Impossible. Space bridge
technology's been lost for mega-cycles.

12:42.730 --> 12:45.865
And yet he managed!
Shockwave never left Cybertron

12:45.933 --> 12:51.003
precisely so he could scavenge parts and
reverse-engineer space bridge mechanics!

12:51.072 --> 12:55.441
And you just delivered all the
Energon he needs to power it up.

12:55.510 --> 12:59.245
While it often pains me,
I try to be a team player.

13:03.073 --> 13:05.941
- Going somewhere?
- To take down a space bridge.

13:06.010 --> 13:11.180
- Without me?
- This'll require stealth, not... chatter.

13:11.249 --> 13:13.949
Oh, you mean the chatter that
distracted Starscream

13:14.018 --> 13:16.352
long enough for you
to free yourself?

13:16.421 --> 13:18.287
Just try not to slow me down.

13:23.026 --> 13:24.360
You know where you're going?

13:24.429 --> 13:26.429
My unit used these
tunnels during the war.

13:26.497 --> 13:28.431
They're part of old Cybertron.

13:33.403 --> 13:36.972
The sooner we blow the bridge, the
sooner we join up with Optimus Prime.

13:37.041 --> 13:38.874
Give him my regards.

13:40.911 --> 13:44.280
Did you not hear Prime's
message? He needs us.

13:44.348 --> 13:49.452
Teamwork isn't my thing. after we
finish this, you and I go our separate ways.

13:49.520 --> 13:50.953
Whatever you say, partner.

13:51.022 --> 13:55.024
Let's get one thing straight...
you are not my partner.

13:55.092 --> 13:59.295
Arcee, I know it's rough.
I really do.

13:59.363 --> 14:02.598
I don't know what you're
talking about.

14:02.667 --> 14:04.533
Tailgate.

14:09.840 --> 14:12.174
<i>Tailgate!</i>

14:12.243 --> 14:13.676
Closing yourself off from feeling...

14:13.744 --> 14:16.912
<i>...won't help anyone.</i>

14:20.016 --> 14:24.253
- Sounds familiar.
- Good advice is good advice.

14:24.522 --> 14:27.990
So, I got to know...
what happened next?

14:42.105 --> 14:45.007
Shockwave's latest work of art.

14:45.376 --> 14:49.018
Already fueled and ready to rip.

14:49.019 --> 14:51.447
Arcee ... look familiar?

14:53.216 --> 14:54.984
The coordines Optimus provided.

14:55.052 --> 14:57.286
They're being used to
target the space bridge.

14:57.355 --> 15:00.055
Which means the 'Cons will
ambush Optimus and his team

15:00.124 --> 15:03.158
before any Autobot
reinforcements can get there.

15:10.286 --> 15:13.756
If the 'Cons scorch Optimus,
the war is as good as over.

15:13.824 --> 15:16.391
We can fix that.

15:16.460 --> 15:19.361
No. We don't have the
ordnance to blow the bridge.

15:19.430 --> 15:21.830
I'll have to sabotage
the control systems.

15:21.899 --> 15:22.924
What about access?

15:22.925 --> 15:26.001
You just gonna walk up
and ask for permission?

15:26.070 --> 15:28.771
No... you are.

15:28.839 --> 15:32.074
<i>Uh, excuse me. I got
separated from the tour group.</i>

15:32.143 --> 15:35.677
Does anyone know where
I can find the Decepticon base?

15:37.915 --> 15:40.315
Whoa! Didn't Commander
Starscream tell you?

15:40.384 --> 15:43.418
I'm on your side now.

15:45.155 --> 15:48.490
<i>That coward Optimus Prime
turned tail and ran.</i>

15:48.559 --> 15:51.794
Left the rest of us Autobots to
fend for ourselves.

15:51.862 --> 15:55.030
So much for comraderie, huh?
Figured I'd rather be on the

15:55.099 --> 15:58.200
winning team, so I took
Starscream up on his offer.

15:58.269 --> 16:01.103
Imagine the look on Prime's
face when it starts raining

16:01.172 --> 16:03.605
Decepticons ... me with them.

16:05.975 --> 16:09.077
Really, I know all about
Starscream's plan.

16:09.146 --> 16:11.013
We can all get along now.

16:14.517 --> 16:18.554
There's... someone behind me,
isn't there?

16:18.622 --> 16:22.858
Only Starscream could fail to
dispose of a helpless captive.

16:28.398 --> 16:31.900
Uh... is it supposed
to sound like that?

16:34.070 --> 16:36.271
<i>Interloper!</i>

16:41.244 --> 16:45.581
You have overridden the
Energon-containment protocols, haven't you?

16:45.649 --> 16:49.218
Clever, but not irreversible.

17:50.613 --> 17:54.950
There is more than one way
to nullify a neural net.

17:56.753 --> 17:58.687
Not this time.

18:08.531 --> 18:10.165
Cliff?

18:10.234 --> 18:13.235
I knew you cared.

18:13.304 --> 18:17.005
It appears Shockwave's
arrogance was his undoing.

18:17.074 --> 18:18.941
Destroy them!

18:24.948 --> 18:29.251
Autobots ...  whatever you did to
the space bridge, undo it now!

18:29.320 --> 18:33.956
They should really stop shooting
at us if they want our help.

18:34.024 --> 18:36.591
Seeing as how our exit is
blocked and we have an open

18:36.660 --> 18:40.295
space bridge portal currently
set for Prime's location...

18:42.532 --> 18:44.399
You with me?

18:56.079 --> 18:59.348
The space bridge...
it's going to blow!

19:14.497 --> 19:16.832
Give it everything you got!

19:46.563 --> 19:49.097
Whoo!
Bull's-Eye!

20:07.750 --> 20:10.519
- Think Shockwave survived?
- Hope so.

20:10.887 --> 20:13.889
I want a rematch.

20:17.027 --> 20:21.396
Let's find Optimus...
partner.

20:28.605 --> 20:32.741
<i>Rich with Energon, huh? Hope the
whole rock doesn't look like this.</i>

20:32.810 --> 20:37.396
<i>Reminds me of the time I was
lost in the sea of rust back on Cybertron,</i>

20:37.431 --> 20:41.450
<i> except I was separated from
my unit with absolutely no one to talk to.</i>

20:41.518 --> 20:46.922
<i>- Talk at?
- Admit it ... you love the company!</i>

20:54.396 --> 20:56.126
Funny...

20:56.161 --> 20:59.901
At first, I didn't think I'd ever
get used to Cliff's constant chatter.

21:02.004 --> 21:05.740
Now... there's nothing
