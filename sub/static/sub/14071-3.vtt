00:48.882 --> 00:50.918
My real friends never hearing from me

00:51.009 --> 00:54.126
Fake friends write the wrong
answers on the mirror for me

your bony ass dialing me.

01:34.678 --> 01:37.260
Spence, see, we got a...
We got a serious problem.

01:37.347 --> 01:38.883
Yeah, you’re calling me at 5:00 am.

01:39.182 --> 01:42.674
Vern fucked up his leg.
He look like a fucking horror show.

01:44.813 --> 01:46.223
(CAMERA CLICKS)

01:46.315 --> 01:47.395
Ah!

01:49.860 --> 01:52.522
Damn it. Can he put any weight on it?

01:52.613 --> 01:55.150
Yesterday, yeah, but not now.

01:55.240 --> 01:58.858
He was working out really hard
and heard a pop.

01:59.536 --> 02:00.571
Like he'd been shot?

02:00.829 --> 02:03.536
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Shot?

02:03.915 --> 02:05.325
No, that’s crazy talk.

02:05.709 --> 02:08.701
No, I'm talking about the sound, Reggie.
He might have popped his Achilles.

02:08.879 --> 02:11.871
Meet me at the Sports Med Center.
I’m gonna call Dr. Russ.

02:12.049 --> 02:15.007
He did Manning's neck
and both of my shoulders.

02:15.093 --> 02:17.345
lwill meet you there.
And no clicking around, do you hear me?

-Uber driver now, man?
-Come on, man, look.

02:41.078 --> 02:42.784
Ricky Jerret hit the open market,

02:42.871 --> 02:45.362
they send the most
charismatic and influential man in town.

02:45.582 --> 02:48.415
And the man responsible
for designing your new contract.

02:48.502 --> 02:49.833
You sound as confident as ever.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.161
Hey, come on, man,
New Orleans is the greatest city in America.

02:52.255 --> 02:54.382
Hey, look, folks here, man,
they will embrace you

02:54.466 --> 02:55.797
and make you one of their own, Rick.

02:55.884 --> 02:59.627
And when they do, you will feel a warmth
that you've never felt in your life.

02:59.930 --> 03:02.546
Well, I hope that warmth
comes with a big-ass offer.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.840
Hey, trust me, we pulled out all the stops.

03:04.935 --> 03:07.802

you to Café Du Monde to get you a beignet.

-A beignet.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.616
Oh, you stopped for tacos.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.869
It's a chalupa. I bought you one.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.451
No, no, no. I'm good. I'm good.
We're gonna get you inside.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.499
He was hungry. What I'm supposed to say?

03:38.009 --> 03:39.089
I'm just parking.

03:39.177 --> 03:41.133
It'd be best ifl park the car. l'majust do that.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.586
I don't want to get cut on.

03:42.681 --> 03:45.138
It's all right. I got you the best doc in the biz.

03:45.434 --> 03:46.890
I've had seven surgeries with him,

03:46.977 --> 03:51.186
and every single time it's like taking a nap
in the arms of a beautiful lady.

03:51.732 --> 03:56.101
I got to be straight up, Spence.
lwasn't training. lwas playing paintball.

03:56.445 --> 03:58.606
Okay, well, don't worry about that, all right?

03:58.697 --> 04:00.858
-We're gonna get you better.
-Cool.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.155
(MOUTHS) Fuck.

04:02.409 --> 04:06.243
I guess this answers the question,
"How much training can one man do?"

04:06.329 --> 04:07.910
Doc, thanks for getting here so quick.

04:07.998 --> 04:09.954
Lucky for you,
I can literally do these in my sleep.

04:10.041 --> 04:11.542
-Grab a chair.
-Yep.

04:13.336 --> 04:15.748
-On your knees, kid.
-Thompson test. It's all right.

04:15.839 --> 04:17.420
It's how we check your Achilles.

04:17.507 --> 04:19.623
It's cool, Vern. Theyjust here to help.

04:24.723 --> 04:28.591
Please, please, heavenly Jesus.
Don't fuck with my Achilles.

04:28.852 --> 04:31.685
Afraid he isn't listening. Prep the OR, please.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.729
REGGIE: Hey, listen, Vern,
it's gonna be all right, man.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.019
There you go.

04:37.486 --> 04:39.442
Doc, a CT scan just to make sure?

04:39.529 --> 04:40.939
Absolutely, but I'm pretty sure

04:41.031 --> 04:42.692
The Holy One won't come through
there either.

04:42.783 --> 04:45.274
-I need to get him ready.
-Hey, man, you gonna be all right, Vern.

04:45.368 --> 04:47.529
You're gonna come back better than ever.
Don't worry about it.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.782
You can climb Mount Kilimanjaro
if you want to.

04:49.873 --> 04:51.033
SPENCER: Stay strong, brother.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.116
I got to call Hal, update the team.

04:54.211 --> 04:57.044
-What the fuck for?
-Because Vernon could miss half the season.

04:57.130 --> 05:00.497
-What kind of training was he doing?
-Paintball.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.884
Please, stop. Just tell me
that this is some new shit

05:03.970 --> 05:05.346
at Jay Glazer's gym.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.807
No, it's not.
They were literally running around the woods

05:07.891 --> 05:09.051
playing fucking pretend soldier.

05:09.351 --> 05:11.216
Oh, good, look. There's a defibrillator.

05:11.311 --> 05:15.020
Hey, man, it wasn't my idea.
Laser tag is more my game.

05:15.106 --> 05:17.097
I mean, it got air conditioning in there.

05:17.192 --> 05:19.604
They got a snack bar.
The snacks are delicious.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.559
Dallas could void Vernon's contract.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.771
Fucking NFls.

05:24.616 --> 05:25.776
What are we gonna tell him?

05:26.243 --> 05:30.612
REGGIE: Uh, look, if it's gonna mess
with Vern's money, then don't tell him shit.

05:30.705 --> 05:32.741
I mean, Vern's got a right to have a life.

05:33.959 --> 05:35.324
God damn it, no.

05:35.418 --> 05:37.283
What? What?

05:38.088 --> 05:39.749
I fucking agree with Reggie.

05:40.423 --> 05:41.583
What?

05:43.260 --> 05:44.875
Just a matter of time.

05:46.596 --> 05:49.008
All right, I got to take the minivan today.

05:49.099 --> 05:51.715
I'm gonna pick up a big plant
for Kiki's room after work.

05:51.810 --> 05:53.175
Help boost the oxygen levels.

05:53.436 --> 05:56.769
Hmm. Ever wonder why
keys are so popular with babies?

05:57.274 --> 05:58.684
They got nowhere to be.

05:58.775 --> 06:00.140
You okay?

06:00.652 --> 06:02.017
Yeah, I'm good.

06:02.112 --> 06:05.696
Just been up all night thinking about
this whole right-tackle thing.

06:05.782 --> 06:08.615
It's a tough switch, but you never shied away
from a challenge.

06:09.286 --> 06:12.028
Pssh, blocking Chandler Jones is a challenge.

06:12.122 --> 06:14.704
This is like asking a lefty
to throw righty, huh?

06:15.458 --> 06:16.447
Huh?

06:16.543 --> 06:19.535
It's like when you play left tackle,

06:19.629 --> 06:23.542
your dominant side is your right arm

06:23.633 --> 06:25.339
-and your right leg.
-Mmm-hmm.

06:25.427 --> 06:28.794
But when you're on the right tackle,
it's the whole other way around.

06:28.889 --> 06:32.302
You got different hand placement.
We got different footwork.

06:32.475 --> 06:35.717
You got to get out in front of the run.
It's a lot more hitting.

06:35.812 --> 06:38.724
I'm sorry, baby. I promise you I'm listening,

06:38.815 --> 06:42.524
but you look so damn cute right now
and I'm late for work.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.476
Whoop, wrong ones.

06:44.654 --> 06:47.737
-Spencer Strasmore, number 92.
-(PHONE CHIMES)

06:47.824 --> 06:49.906
-Sorry, buddy, I've got to get this.
-Quick selfie?

06:49.993 --> 06:51.324
-Get in here.
-Yeahl

06:52.245 --> 06:53.280

06:53.413 --> 06:55.904
-Thank you.
-You're welcome. (LAUGHS)

06:56.374 --> 06:58.751
-Hey, Joe.
-JOE: Hey, where the fuck are you?

06:58.835 --> 07:01.827
Well, Vernon blew out his Achilles,
so I'm at the hospital.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.628
Man! Is he okay?

07:03.715 --> 07:06.127
-He's scared shitless and he should be.
-Oh, my God.

07:06.217 --> 07:09.345
Well, I’ll have Virginia
send flowers or something.

07:09.429 --> 07:13.468
But, hey, meantime, your old buddy
Andre’s banging on our clients.

07:13.683 --> 07:15.423
-Who's he trying to take?
-A// of them.

07:15.644 --> 07:17.305
Everyone except for Vern and Ricky.

07:17.479 --> 07:19.686
-What the fuck?
-Yeah, that's right.

07:19.856 --> 07:23.769
Victor Cruz, LaMarr Woodley,
Jared Odrick, Spice Adams.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.270
They all got calls.

07:25.362 --> 07:28.229
-Spice is retired.
-Yeah, well, he’s carpet bombing, man.

07:28.573 --> 07:31.064
I told Victor we'd get him a dance studio.

07:31.159 --> 07:34.651
Jared wants a fashion line
and LaMarr's starting a record label.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.453
His cousin's demo's actually not that bad.

07:37.582 --> 07:40.119
All right, Joe, don't make any promises
we can't keep, okay?

07:40.210 --> 07:42.417
Hey, l'mjust trying to
hold down the fort here, okay, pal?

07:42.504 --> 07:44.085
We're under siege.

07:44.172 --> 07:45.878
Any of those guys in town?

07:45.966 --> 07:50.050
Yeah, Spice.
He's in town scouting locations for his hotel.

07:50.136 --> 07:52.172
He wants to build a fucking hotel?

07:52.263 --> 07:56.723
His pitch was very heartwarming.
He started to cry.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.391
Joe, we have to get ahead of this.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.684
Let's set up an appointment with Spice,

07:59.771 --> 08:02.103
let's take him for a steak dinner
while he's in town.

08:02.190 --> 08:04.306
And, Joe, stop approving shit.

08:04.401 --> 08:07.234
Okay. Don't ever tell me what to do. Bye.

08:07.529 --> 08:08.518
(SIGHS)

08:09.531 --> 08:11.692
-Tell her multiple times a day I miss her.
-All right, baby.

08:11.783 --> 08:13.614
-I love you, baby.
-(MUSIC BLARING)

08:13.702 --> 08:18.537
Every day with this punk. Hey!
Damn it, slow your ass down!

08:24.045 --> 08:25.285
Damn it.

08:28.258 --> 08:31.625
Hey, Spence, you was right.
It wasn't that bad after all.

08:31.761 --> 08:35.094
Glad to hear that. Now, you want to tell us
why the fuck you were playing paintball?

08:35.765 --> 08:37.266
Just trying to keep it loose.

08:37.350 --> 08:41.013
Vernon, you can't play paintball,
basketball, baseball,

08:41.104 --> 08:44.016
anything with a fucking ball in it
in the off-season for this exact reason.

08:44.107 --> 08:45.847
Technically, it's more like a pellet.

08:48.278 --> 08:52.567
Vernon, you have an entire organization,
teammates that depend on you.

08:52.657 --> 08:55.740
You can't keep taking risks with your career
for shits and giggles like this.

08:55.827 --> 08:58.159
What's the point of working so hard
if you can't have any fun?

08:58.246 --> 09:00.202
You don't get paid if you don't play.

09:00.290 --> 09:01.996
They have to pay him.
The contract's guaranteed.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.699
Not if they find out it's a non-football injury.

09:04.794 --> 09:08.252
So then they won't find out.
I mean, nobody saw us.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.501
Jason already told them
that Vern was working out.

09:10.592 --> 09:13.584
Look, you were in the backyard
doing agility drills with Marcus, all right?

09:13.970 --> 09:16.507
-Three-cone L drills.
-I don't like to lie.

09:20.477 --> 09:23.719
Vernon, Dallas can never find out
how this happened.

09:23.813 --> 09:25.428
Hey, man, you're not property, Vern.

09:25.523 --> 09:26.808
You don't owe them nothing.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.941
Three-cone L drill it is, I guess.

09:36.326 --> 09:38.738
You know, I still show my guys Clips
from that game you had as a rookie.

09:38.828 --> 09:41.114
They had a meaningless week 16 game
versus Denver

09:41.331 --> 09:44.949
and you put up 217 yards
mostly on little slants.

09:45.043 --> 09:46.704
We lost 42-14.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.502
-But who got those 14?
-I did.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.126
-(LAUGH|NG)
-Damn right, you did.

09:52.217 --> 09:56.460
Listen, Miami, they didn't utilize
your speed like we will.

09:56.554 --> 09:58.260
And you still stuffed the stat sheet.

09:58.348 --> 10:00.930
Yeah, we're totally open if you have any plays
you want to bring with you.

10:01.017 --> 10:03.178
No, I'm all about the present and the future.

10:03.353 --> 10:05.935
That's good to hear.
You got any questions for us?

10:06.856 --> 10:08.016
Yeah.

10:09.484 --> 10:11.145
Where's the love?

10:14.364 --> 10:15.945
Moms worked hard saving up dough,

10:16.032 --> 10:17.988
so every summer when it got
a little hot in the hood,

10:18.368 --> 10:21.701
she would take us kids
to a little motel on the beach in AC.

10:21.788 --> 10:25.451
Place was a rat hole,
but I had the best times of my life there.

10:25.542 --> 10:29.126
Yeah, fond memories. You know,
it's sentimental. It gets you right there.

10:29.212 --> 10:32.249
Yeah. My hotel is gonna be elegant and cool,

10:32.549 --> 10:35.382
but affordable so anybody can come.

10:35.677 --> 10:37.213
I'm gonna name it after my moms.

10:37.554 --> 10:38.669
Elidee.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.050
-EHdee.
-EHdee?

10:41.224 --> 10:42.885
-It means honorable.
-Oh, my God.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.558
-Nice.
-Doesn't that just melt your heart or what?

10:45.854 --> 10:46.889
Yeah.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.346
Man, I hope someday
some kid will come to Elidee

10:49.440 --> 10:51.476
and feel the exact same way that I did

10:51.568 --> 10:53.524
minus the bedbugs and bloodstains.

10:53.611 --> 10:55.112
(LAUGHS)

10:55.572 --> 10:56.607
Bloodstains.

10:56.698 --> 10:57.904
Well, hotels are hot right now,

10:57.991 --> 10:59.572
-especially in Miami.
-Mmm-hmm.

10:59.951 --> 11:01.111
That's what Andre said.

11:03.204 --> 11:04.284
Yeah.

11:04.372 --> 11:07.114
Look, Spice, it's a boom or bust town.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.415
-How much you putting in?
-$4 million.

11:09.711 --> 11:11.747
$4 million. It's no Chump Change, brother.

11:12.005 --> 11:15.748
Well, hey, look,
if the location's right, we should explore it.

11:17.260 --> 11:19.672
-I got a primo spot in Key Largo.
-JOE: Nice.

11:19.762 --> 11:22.344
So let me go unleash hell real quick,
and we'll talk more about it.

11:22.432 --> 11:24.923
-All right. All right.
-All right.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.007
What the fuck are you doing?

11:26.102 --> 11:27.888
Oh, my God,
will you just hold on to your principles

11:27.979 --> 11:30.721
for a few days
and do whatever the man says, please?

11:30.815 --> 11:33.022
Four million dollars is way too much
of a risk for him.

11:33.109 --> 11:34.895
He wants to honor his dead morn.

11:34.986 --> 11:37.068
I've already got Vernon
lying to Dallas about his injury.

11:37.155 --> 11:38.691
I'm in no mood to bullshit anybody anymore.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.317
Don't be so quick to judge, okay?

11:40.408 --> 11:42.569
Let's just go see the property.
Give it a Chance.

11:42.660 --> 11:44.616
No fucking way. I've been up since 5:00 am.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.114
I'm about ready to pass out now.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.037
Oh, whaa, whaa.

11:48.124 --> 11:49.705
-Listen to you.
-Take a nap for God's sake.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.657
Touch your heart again
when he's telling you a story.

11:52.128 --> 11:53.959
I was actually touched by that.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.625
What is this? We didn't order dessert.

11:56.716 --> 11:59.207
It's compliments
of Miami Wealth Management.

11:59.302 --> 12:02.214
Andre also picked up your tab.
He's such a mensch.

12:02.305 --> 12:03.795
He's the best.

12:07.477 --> 12:10.310
So, you guys want to go
Check this property outwith your boy?

12:12.732 --> 12:14.438
-It's a brilliant idea, Spice.
-Yeah.

12:14.525 --> 12:15.560
-Let's do it.
-Let's do it.

12:15.652 --> 12:17.062
You're not gonna leave this here, are you?

12:17.153 --> 12:18.359
No way. We'll box that up.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.903
-We already got the tab.
-That's what I'm talking about.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.070
Hut.

12:24.285 --> 12:26.367
Bad news about the minivan, babe.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.911
Started making this little
Click, Click, Click noise,

12:28.998 --> 12:30.829
so I had to bring it into the shop.

12:32.502 --> 12:34.288
Okay. Damn!

12:34.379 --> 12:36.495
I mean, it's all good.
I can pick it up in the morning.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.249
Oh, no, no, no. It's not you.

12:39.300 --> 12:42.633
I'm trying to play with the right tackle

12:42.720 --> 12:45.336
and I don't know
if I'm gonna be able to do this.

12:45.431 --> 12:49.015
I mean, I guess if this is what
the Dolphins want, I got no Choice.

12:49.102 --> 12:52.811
It's not like teams are lining up
for a 35-year-old tackle.

12:52.939 --> 12:56.523
Hey, you're notjust any tackle, baby.

12:56.693 --> 12:58.308
-Ooh.
-You the Black Swan.

12:58.403 --> 12:59.768
Oh, mmm.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.362
Okay, baby, Ijust...
I got to make me one block.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.156
You just did.

13:06.619 --> 13:07.699
Hey.

13:28.141 --> 13:31.224
Jason, it's Hal. Sorry to keep bugging you.

13:31.686 --> 13:33.517
Where the fuck is our player?

13:34.063 --> 13:35.803
Call me, you son of a bitch.

13:39.902 --> 13:43.941
Hey, Reg, man, let me know when he gone.
I got to pee like a bitch.

13:45.575 --> 13:48.783
JOE: Looks great if you picture it
without the garbage, you know?

13:49.412 --> 13:52.779
I'm shocked no one's pounced on this place.

13:52.874 --> 13:55.832
Yeah. Yeah, you know,
I think with a little work,

13:55.918 --> 13:57.203
this place could be the Shangri-la

13:57.295 --> 13:58.455
-of the Keys.
-(PHONE CHIMES)

13:58.546 --> 14:00.958
Guys, I've got to take this. What's up, Jay?

14:01.049 --> 14:03.631
Vernon's gone AWOL again.
He's not taking my calls.

14:03.718 --> 14:06.505
Hal even flew in from Dallas
and said that he wasn't home.

14:06.596 --> 14:10.430
-You try the hospital?
-Yeah, he was released after surgery.

14:10.516 --> 14:11.676
Look, you know, I got company.

14:11.768 --> 14:14.259
I'm gonna shut it down for the day.
I need to unwind.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.060
All right, no problem. I'm gonna find him.

14:16.147 --> 14:18.889
All right, maybe you’ll ﬁnd him
zip-lining over a lake of ﬁre

14:18.983 --> 14:22.646
or fucking skiing off-piste in the Swiss Alps.

14:23.905 --> 14:25.736
I've got bad news, boys.

14:26.074 --> 14:28.690
-What's up?
-Those are red mangrove.

14:28.785 --> 14:30.070
Yeah, they're beautiful, right?

14:30.536 --> 14:31.946
They're also blocking the view.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.528
So we just hack them out.

14:33.623 --> 14:35.784
It's against the law to cut these down, Spice.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.411
These look like they got
a lot of growing to do.

14:37.502 --> 14:39.834
Well, that will help
with shoreline erosion, right?

14:39.921 --> 14:41.957
And not everybody likes looking at the water.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.464
-That's right.
-Yeah.

14:45.343 --> 14:49.712
Yeah, well, those people don't come
to the Florida fucking Keys, guys.

14:49.806 --> 14:52.673
-Come on, look at this.
-So, you're not into it?

14:52.767 --> 14:55.383
Of course he's into it. We're both into it.

14:55.478 --> 14:57.685
It's just gonna take
a little vision, right, Spence?

15:00.066 --> 15:02.603
It's gonna take a little vision,
but maybe we can make it work.

15:02.693 --> 15:04.274
-See?
-There we go.

15:04.362 --> 15:07.195
-EHdee.
-EHdee,yeah.

15:08.282 --> 15:09.692
Elidee.

15:10.785 --> 15:13.652
We need a vet like you in our receiver room.

15:14.038 --> 15:17.326
Someone who can show these young guys
what it takes to be a real pro

15:17.417 --> 15:19.908
and a reliable third-down guy for crunch time.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.708
We need a leader.

15:22.004 --> 15:24.256
You can finish your career
here in New Orleans.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.581
Yeah, Steve Smith played till he was 36.

15:26.676 --> 15:31.841
And here's proof that we believe
you have that kind of longevity.

16:18.352 --> 16:21.185
-I'm ready to get the fuck out of here.
-They lowba/ling you already?

16:21.272 --> 16:25.561
No, the offer's solid, actually,
but for a City full of soul, I ain't feeling it.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.812
No Coach Payton, no Drew Brees.

16:27.904 --> 16:31.362
They want to get into Ricky Jerret’s pants,
they better bring their "A" game.

16:31.449 --> 16:33.280
Okay, no, no, no. I hear you.

16:33.367 --> 16:35.449
But listen, Payton and Brees
are probably not there

16:35.536 --> 16:38.448
because they're probably on vacation
with their families or something like that.

16:38.539 --> 16:42.077
Hell, I could use a vacay. Shit, I planned
on going to Jerusalem this summer.

16:42.168 --> 16:45.831
Instead, I'm flying my ass around
all over the country trying to get a newjob.

16:45.922 --> 16:49.665
Okay, well, let’s just be smart,
keep a calm head, all right?

16:49.759 --> 16:51.590
Shit, you didn't when you were here.

16:51.969 --> 16:53.300
No, that's right, I didn't.

16:53.387 --> 16:55.639
Instead of riding off into the sunset,

16:55.723 --> 16:59.011
I drove right into a fucking brick wall.
Thank you, honey.

16:59.101 --> 17:02.764
Listen, turn the phone off tonight
and get some sleep, okay?

17:02.855 --> 17:04.470
Sounds like you should do the same, Spence.

17:05.191 --> 17:06.556
No rest for the weary, brother.

17:06.651 --> 17:08.767
-You know that.
-I feel you.

17:10.238 --> 17:12.650
Oh, some dude named Andre Allen called

17:12.740 --> 17:14.276
about an investment opportunity.

17:16.577 --> 17:17.612
What'd you tell him?

17:17.703 --> 17:20.786
Told him he can kiss my ass.
I got the best moneyman in the business.

17:21.123 --> 17:23.500
(LAUGHS) My man. My man.

17:23.584 --> 17:25.540
All right, get some rest
and I'll call you tomorrow.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.261
Where's Spice?

17:37.348 --> 17:39.464
Oh, he's pissing in the mangroves.

17:40.977 --> 17:42.888
To the honorable Elidee.

17:44.313 --> 17:45.894
You know this property is no good.

17:47.608 --> 17:50.270
-It's not that terrible.
-It's a piece of shit.

17:50.611 --> 17:53.068
Just please quit being so pessimistic.

17:53.155 --> 17:56.022
Stop being so soft.
Without trust we got nothing.

17:56.117 --> 17:57.903
What the fuck are we supposed to do, then,

17:57.994 --> 18:00.406
with fuckface Andre
trying to steal all our Clients?

18:00.496 --> 18:02.487
Just tell Spice it's shit

18:02.582 --> 18:04.573
and let him run into the arms
of the competition?

18:04.667 --> 18:07.204
Joe, we're his advisors, okay?

18:07.295 --> 18:09.877
And stringing him along
just to save our asses, that's not right.

outside the lines, okay?

isn't gonna happen here, Spice.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.250
What? What you mean?

I mean you don't have the money,
the location sucks,

-I need this.
-And we're gonna get it for you, okay?

19:10.399 --> 19:12.890
I promise you that. We did it for Suh.

We're doing it for our other Clients
and eventually we're gonna do it for you.

19:16.447 --> 19:19.655
But you got to take my word for this.
This is not the place, okay?

19:19.867 --> 19:21.858
And listen, going broke on this deal

19:21.952 --> 19:25.661
just to honor your dead mother
is not the way to do it, brother.

Shit, I feel bad. I let them all down.

23:04.091 --> 23:06.173
Yeah, yeah. And now you got Hal

23:06.260 --> 23:09.093
stalking through your bushes
like a fucking pedophile.

23:09.179 --> 23:12.467
Vernon, these are the guys
that sign your Checks.

23:13.309 --> 23:14.515
I don't want to lie to them, Spence.

23:18.647 --> 23:19.636
Then don't.

23:21.483 --> 23:24.771
If your gut says tell the truth,
then that's exactly what you should do.

23:24.987 --> 23:26.602
What if they decide to cut me loose?

23:28.574 --> 23:30.030
Let me tell you something, Vern.

23:30.993 --> 23:31.982
(GROANS)

23:32.661 --> 23:36.904
I once did some shit that I didn't want to face,

23:36.999 --> 23:39.456
so I dropped my phone in a glass Of beer.

23:39.543 --> 23:42.501
Not too long after that,
I was packing for New Orleans.

23:44.465 --> 23:46.626
Brother, make the call.

23:47.426 --> 23:50.759
You need Dallas
just as badly as they need you.

23:52.014 --> 23:53.003
(SIGHS)

23:54.558 --> 23:56.219
All right, Spence.

23:56.602 --> 23:58.092
(PHONE RINGING)

23:58.187 --> 24:00.929
Vernon, we've been worried about you.

24:01.023 --> 24:03.560
-How are you?
-Been a whole lot better, sir.

24:03.651 --> 24:07.189
But my agent says when I come back,
I'll be able to Climb Mt. Kilimanjaro.

24:08.030 --> 24:09.861
Well, maybe I’ll join you.

24:09.949 --> 24:12.691
I wanted to make sure
the plug was taking care of himself.

24:12.910 --> 24:14.275
Doing my best, sir.

24:14.370 --> 24:17.237
If ignoring your calls
and hiding from Hal is your best, son,

24:17.998 --> 24:19.374
it simply won't do.

24:19.708 --> 24:21.744
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

24:21.835 --> 24:23.700
Tell me what really happened.

24:27.508 --> 24:30.591
Honestly, I lied to Jason.

24:30.678 --> 24:32.464
I wasn't training when I got hurt.

24:32.554 --> 24:34.055
lwas playing paintball with my friends.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.342
-Paintball?
-Yes, sir.

24:39.436 --> 24:41.552
Paintball. Ever tried it?

24:43.482 --> 24:44.847
Goodbye, Vernon.

24:45.401 --> 24:46.607
Hello?

24:53.909 --> 24:54.898
RAHEEM: Yo, Rick.

24:55.828 --> 24:57.489
What, you ain't gonna let me leave?

24:57.871 --> 24:59.657
I ain't afraid to fly commercial.

24:59.748 --> 25:02.990
Come on, you don't think
we'd actually send Off Ricky Jerret that way.

25:03.085 --> 25:04.416

25:05.921 --> 25:08.412

25:40.456 --> 25:41.787
MAN: You feel the love now, Ricky?

25:42.791 --> 25:44.201
Absolutely, Coach Payton.

25:44.293 --> 25:45.533
I did not expect you.

25:45.627 --> 25:48.004
Hey, it's good to see you.
Drew wanted to be here, too,

25:48.088 --> 25:49.703
but he's with the family down in New Zealand.

25:49.798 --> 25:51.208
-It's good having you.
-I understand that.

25:51.300 --> 25:53.086
It's good to be here.

25:54.219 --> 25:56.631
