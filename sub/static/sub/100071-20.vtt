00:02.528 --> 00:05.296
_

00:15.851 --> 00:18.560
_

00:33.893 --> 00:35.651
D'oh!

01:09.738 --> 01:11.738
None of you will inherit anything.

01:11.814 --> 01:13.981
Because there isn't any.

01:17.736 --> 01:18.995
D'oh.

01:25.828 --> 01:27.411
Previously on <i> The Simpsons,</i>

01:27.422 --> 01:30.590
a charismatic new preacher
came to Springfield.

01:30.667 --> 01:31.832
You want to hold my gun?

01:31.909 --> 01:33.702
You-you can.

01:33.928 --> 01:35.002
<i>And Lisa admired him</i>

01:35.079 --> 01:37.254
<i>like no adult man she'd ever met.</i>

01:37.265 --> 01:39.674
This brunch has turned into...

01:39.750 --> 01:41.717
a jazz brunch!

01:42.744 --> 01:43.789
<i>Reverend Lovejoy</i>

01:43.824 --> 01:46.055
<i>lost his job and swore revenge.</i>

01:46.132 --> 01:47.398
<i>This is...</i>

01:47.399 --> 01:50.999
_

02:03.951 --> 02:05.655
_

02:12.542 --> 02:14.142
This preacher is so amazing.

02:14.177 --> 02:15.277
I'm looking forward to this.

02:15.732 --> 02:17.804
This is the first time
I've come to church

02:17.880 --> 02:19.880
when it's not part of a big montage

02:19.957 --> 02:22.500
of my enemies being whacked.

02:22.535 --> 02:24.330
Whoa! Hey! Whoa!

02:24.365 --> 02:27.416
Well, someone looks
awfully nice for church.

02:27.451 --> 02:28.472
Oh, this thing?

02:28.483 --> 02:30.099
Are you sure you aren't just attracted

02:30.176 --> 02:32.485
to our handsome new pastor?

02:32.562 --> 02:36.388
Silly. Moms aren't attracted to pastors.

02:38.216 --> 02:40.934
Oh, this place is so crowded.

02:41.011 --> 02:44.479
My leg is touching Milhouse's dad's.

02:44.532 --> 02:46.698
Looks like we're knee neighbors,
huh, buddy?

02:47.893 --> 02:49.651
Mr. Smithers.

02:49.728 --> 02:52.312
I don't think I've ever
seen you without Mr. Burns.

02:52.389 --> 02:54.189
Oh, Mr. Burns
is more comfortable at home

02:54.266 --> 02:56.117
reading his copies of the scriptures.

03:00.437 --> 03:02.072
"Blessed be the poor"?

03:02.083 --> 03:03.907
I'm just finding this out now?

03:03.918 --> 03:05.417
No one must know.

03:10.449 --> 03:12.166
Exodus.

03:12.242 --> 03:15.085
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

03:15.096 --> 03:17.045
For those of you interested
in the Packers game...

03:17.122 --> 03:18.839
We don't want to know.

03:18.916 --> 03:21.592
So, I know some of you still
have some questions about me.

03:21.602 --> 03:22.885
I certainly do.

03:22.961 --> 03:25.596
Will you be godfather to my son?

03:26.006 --> 03:27.347
We're not there yet, Mel.

03:27.424 --> 03:30.225
But, seriously, fewer and fewer
people are coming to church.

03:30.302 --> 03:33.228
Numbers are declining. And I get it.

03:33.305 --> 03:35.114
When you tell people
that you believe in God,

03:35.191 --> 03:36.523
usually they take that to mean

03:36.600 --> 03:38.567
that you're quietly
judging their lifestyle

03:38.644 --> 03:41.612
or think everybody but
you is going to Hell.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.447
Way to preach, bitch.

03:43.457 --> 03:44.790
I'm gonna pretend I heard "amen."

03:44.867 --> 03:46.074
Oh, relax, bitch.

03:49.154 --> 03:51.121
The original function of religion

03:51.132 --> 03:53.132
was to bring us together. "Religion."

03:53.209 --> 03:55.042
"Ligio," like "ligament."

03:55.118 --> 03:56.969
It means to reconnect.

03:57.046 --> 03:59.254
They don't teach you
that at medical school.

03:59.331 --> 04:00.336
Yes, they do.

04:00.382 --> 04:02.883
Well, I learn from my mistakes.

04:02.960 --> 04:06.178
Malpractice makes malperfect.

04:06.255 --> 04:07.930
Well, I want to bring us all together.

04:08.006 --> 04:10.307
Not just Christians but
Hindus and Buddhists.

04:10.318 --> 04:12.100
Even those that don't believe.

04:12.177 --> 04:14.153
Does anyone besides me

04:14.230 --> 04:15.979
miss church the way it was?

04:19.305 --> 04:20.784
Well, the crickets agree.

04:20.785 --> 04:22.705
_

04:22.997 --> 04:26.240
This church has gone from a
place of warm, awkward silence

04:26.316 --> 04:30.118
into a gooey lovefest run by
a narcissistic kum-bah-yo-yo,

04:30.195 --> 04:32.162
and I will not stand for it.

04:32.173 --> 04:34.081
You and I believe in the same God.

04:34.157 --> 04:36.333
I just believe that
that God loves everyone.

04:36.344 --> 04:38.035
You don't agree with that, Ned?

04:38.068 --> 04:40.003
Sir, we are not on a first-name basis.

04:40.014 --> 04:41.505
Mr. Flanders.

04:41.515 --> 04:44.016
You may call me New Evangelical Deacon,

04:44.093 --> 04:45.467
or Ned for short.

04:45.544 --> 04:48.178
Okay, Ned, look, God is the love,

04:48.189 --> 04:50.356
the "yes"
that set the universe in motion.

04:50.432 --> 04:52.182

Let me show you how it's done.
And a one, and a two.

06:05.174 --> 06:06.189
Hey!

06:08.602 --> 06:10.844
Aw, sleeping in church.

06:10.921 --> 06:13.439
Like father like daughter.

06:13.515 --> 06:16.442
God is nothing but grace
and flow and forgiveness.

06:16.518 --> 06:17.893
And if you don't think so,

06:17.969 --> 06:19.269
I-I don't know, maybe you should go back

06:19.280 --> 06:21.355
and read the Bible a little bit closer.

06:21.431 --> 06:23.732
Are you questioning a man
who travels with extra Bibles

06:23.809 --> 06:25.659
to put them <i> in</i> hotel rooms?

06:27.621 --> 06:29.863
Do you mind?

06:29.940 --> 06:31.073
I'm sure you're very sincere,

06:31.149 --> 06:33.116
but a parrot can recite the Bible

06:33.127 --> 06:34.451
and have no idea what it means.

06:34.462 --> 06:35.819
What? What? What?

06:35.881 --> 06:37.579
This isn't church anymore.

06:37.656 --> 06:38.689
We're out of here.

06:42.160 --> 06:45.921
Daddy, we can't leave
before the pastor says so.

06:45.956 --> 06:47.964
- Who told you that?
- You did.

06:47.975 --> 06:50.217
You call it "Homer Simpson-ing."

06:51.517 --> 06:54.229
Yeah, don't Homer Simpson, you jerk.

06:55.604 --> 06:57.937
_

06:57.938 --> 06:58.938
_

07:01.394 --> 07:02.419
_

07:02.556 --> 07:04.156
This is where he got fired.

07:04.233 --> 07:05.982
Now we're gonna poke

07:05.993 --> 07:09.069
into Mr. Perfect Pastor's
pysterious past.

07:09.146 --> 07:11.405
Did you just say "pysterious"?

07:11.481 --> 07:14.083
Can't you be on my side for once?

07:22.701 --> 07:25.669
Excuse me, we're looking for the pastor.

07:25.679 --> 07:28.255
Oh, we don't have pastors.
But our touch screen directory

07:28.331 --> 07:30.298
does have a digital assistant.

07:30.375 --> 07:32.518
<i>Hi, I'm Holy Cow.</i>

07:32.594 --> 07:34.594
<i>How can I help you?</i>

07:34.671 --> 07:38.023
<i>Please give us your fingerprint
by pressing this screen.</i>

07:38.100 --> 07:40.434
_

07:40.510 --> 07:42.936
<i>You haven't pressed anything.</i>

07:43.013 --> 07:44.696
<i>Why not?</i>

07:44.697 --> 07:47.397
_

07:47.443 --> 07:50.444
I'd like to speak to someone
below God and above you.

07:50.520 --> 07:54.865
Well, maybe you can find
what you need in here.

07:54.875 --> 07:58.869
How many of you suffer from
the effects of mesothelioma?

07:58.879 --> 08:01.204
Dial Jesus at <i> ocho, ocho, ocho,</i>

08:01.215 --> 08:04.458
<i>ocho, ocho, ocho, ocho.</i>

08:04.534 --> 08:06.051
_

08:15.396 --> 08:16.803
Please help us.

08:16.880 --> 08:19.055
This man is a fellow clergyman.

08:19.066 --> 08:21.066
Really?

08:21.143 --> 08:22.901
Church, steeple,

08:22.978 --> 08:24.227
doors, people!

08:24.238 --> 08:26.396
Come with me.

08:27.272 --> 08:30.150
Preacher Mac?
I have a couple here to see you.

08:30.227 --> 08:34.029
I'm here to discuss a matter
of some unpleasantness.

08:34.105 --> 08:36.914
You're not here from <i>The Boston Globe,</i>
are you?

08:36.991 --> 08:39.075
No, no, no, no, no. I'm a pastor, too.

08:39.086 --> 08:42.254
I hear there's a little dirt
on the collar of a man

08:42.331 --> 08:45.749
who used to preach here, Bode Wright.

08:45.759 --> 08:47.334
Him?!

08:47.410 --> 08:48.877
You better sit down.

08:48.954 --> 08:53.256
It's a short story,
but I'm gonna milk it.

08:53.267 --> 08:58.103
I would go on,
but I am down to my last vocal cord.

08:58.180 --> 09:00.555
Even for a pastor,

09:00.632 --> 09:04.434
I've taken way too long
to make a simple point.

09:04.445 --> 09:05.628
Now...

09:05.715 --> 09:08.238
here's the proof.

09:11.452 --> 09:14.069
Oh, my God, so many singles in my area

09:14.145 --> 09:16.071
want to meet me.

09:16.147 --> 09:17.489
Hmm.

09:18.877 --> 09:20.367
<i>Possessions don't matter,</i>

09:20.443 --> 09:23.720
<i>money doesn't matter,
this doesn't matter.</i>

09:23.773 --> 09:26.414
Is he burning what I think he's burning?

09:26.491 --> 09:28.294
I've got him now.

09:33.715 --> 09:37.643
Lisa Marie Simpson,
are you reading the Bible?

09:37.719 --> 09:39.928
Yes, it's good, but...

09:40.005 --> 09:41.388
I have a few notes.

09:41.464 --> 09:43.056
Yeah, well I never met a Hittite

09:43.133 --> 09:45.976
who wasn't trying to expand
his empire into Egypt.

09:45.986 --> 09:48.754
Oh, Hittites...
worse than the Canaanites!

09:48.763 --> 09:53.066
Oh, now who's doing this because
of the handsome new pastor?

09:53.143 --> 09:54.317
Reverend Wright?

09:54.328 --> 09:55.902
You think he's...

09:55.979 --> 09:58.113
Oh, why pretend?

09:58.189 --> 10:01.741
When he speaks,
I feel like he's speaking only to me.

10:01.818 --> 10:04.119
Oh, Lisa, honey,
I'm worried you'll get too attached.

10:04.195 --> 10:07.839
This town has a way of rejecting
what's new and different.

10:07.874 --> 10:09.082
And better.

10:09.159 --> 10:10.375
Not this time.

10:10.879 --> 10:12.919
But look at your vision board.

10:12.996 --> 10:15.889
It's full of nothing but
crushing disappointment.

10:18.209 --> 10:19.214
Ha-ha!

10:19.261 --> 10:21.344
Even your vision board is a failure.

10:21.355 --> 10:23.188
That hook was supposed to hold

10:23.265 --> 10:25.348
a lifetime's worth of disappointment.

10:31.198 --> 10:34.283
Get thee behind me, Saturn.

10:37.871 --> 10:39.154
I need to pee.

10:39.230 --> 10:41.656
No time. We've got defrocking to do.

10:41.733 --> 10:44.117
Timothy, I've never seen you like this.

10:44.194 --> 10:46.453
Maybe I'll do some defrocking, too.

10:46.529 --> 10:48.496
In the choo choo room?

10:48.573 --> 10:50.957
Okay, mood's gone.

10:51.422 --> 10:52.424
Two beers, Moe.

10:52.461 --> 10:53.627
Nothing for the reverend.

10:53.703 --> 10:55.211
Oh, howdy there, Rev.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.139
Well, can't let him see
my nudie glasses.

10:59.393 --> 11:01.843
You didn't have to break
your nudie glasses.

11:01.920 --> 11:03.511
Now you tell me. Uh, remind me...

11:03.588 --> 11:05.013
how many boobs does a woman have?

11:05.090 --> 11:08.066
I never got so much off my chest.

11:08.143 --> 11:12.145
So, then I coveted my
neighbor's riding mower.

11:12.222 --> 11:15.815
I never pedal when I'm
on a bicycle built for two.

11:15.934 --> 11:17.743
- Homer...
- I went trick-or-treating

11:17.819 --> 11:19.402
when I was 30.

11:19.413 --> 11:23.582
Also, I told Marge I was
going for a colonoscopy

11:23.659 --> 11:27.252
when I actually went to a
<i>Planet of the Apes</i> marathon.

11:27.329 --> 11:29.588
Including the Tim Burton one.

11:29.665 --> 11:30.747
God doesn't care.

11:30.758 --> 11:31.998
Hallelujah!

11:32.075 --> 11:33.541
Please. I make my living in here.

11:33.618 --> 11:35.811
Sorry. So am I forgiven?

11:35.876 --> 11:37.712
You're a good man, Homer Simpson.

11:37.789 --> 11:40.173
Behind all your behavior, good and bad,

11:40.250 --> 11:42.050
there's a still, quiet place

11:42.127 --> 11:43.885
untouched by the dramas of this life

11:43.962 --> 11:46.104
where you simply <i> are</i> goodness.

11:46.181 --> 11:48.890
Oh, you haven't heard the worst one.

11:48.967 --> 11:51.017
I had impure thoughts

11:51.094 --> 11:54.104
about the mother bear
in the toilet paper ads.

11:56.191 --> 11:58.400
<i>Reverend?
If that is your real honorific.</i>

11:58.476 --> 12:01.403
<i>You are late for our parishioners'
visit.</i>

12:01.479 --> 12:03.530
<i>I've been preparing all day.</i>

12:03.606 --> 12:05.407
Uh, sorry. I've got to go.

12:05.483 --> 12:08.585
Homer, does this Flanders guy
ever annoy you?

12:17.662 --> 12:19.262
From time to time.

12:22.500 --> 12:23.883
Move it, move it, move it.

12:25.628 --> 12:26.970
All right.

12:26.980 --> 12:29.089
Which arm did the honking?

12:29.115 --> 12:31.358
I'm not telling.

12:35.013 --> 12:36.563
Come in.

12:49.194 --> 12:52.787
You, sir,
have challenged me on scripture.

12:56.918 --> 12:59.127
Oh. Well, if it's scripture
you want to talk,

12:59.204 --> 13:02.255
then let us make a joyful
noise unto the Lord.

13:02.332 --> 13:04.424
- Good.
- Good.

13:11.191 --> 13:12.432
Punishment is the key to belief.

13:12.509 --> 13:13.933
Matthew 25:46.

13:14.010 --> 13:16.027
"They will go away to eternal
punishment, but the..."

13:16.104 --> 13:17.353
"...righteous to eternal life." Sure.

13:17.364 --> 13:18.813
But God's grace is for everyone.

13:18.890 --> 13:20.273
John 12:32.

13:20.350 --> 13:22.108
"I will draw <i> all</i> people..."

13:22.185 --> 13:23.651
"...up to myself." Hmm.

13:24.550 --> 13:26.780
What about 2 Thessalonians 1:9?

13:26.856 --> 13:29.475
"They will suffer the punishment
of eternal destruction..."

13:29.529 --> 13:31.075
Romans 11:32.

13:31.152 --> 13:33.536
"He may have mercy on them all."

13:33.547 --> 13:35.163
Them <i> all.</i>

13:38.176 --> 13:39.276
_

13:39.369 --> 13:41.052
Genesis 3:23.

13:41.129 --> 13:43.671
"So the Lord banished
him from the Garden."

13:43.748 --> 13:45.799
Genesis 1:31.

13:45.875 --> 13:47.634
"God saw all that He had made,

13:47.710 --> 13:49.969
and it was very good."

13:50.046 --> 13:51.096
Bang.

13:52.474 --> 13:54.849
I'm cold, so cold.

13:54.926 --> 13:56.693
And I'm wearing three sweaters.

13:56.694 --> 13:57.694
_

14:00.574 --> 14:02.982
Wow. This is what it would be like

14:03.059 --> 14:06.152
if they believed in God in Hawaii.

14:06.229 --> 14:08.696
Reverend, you come
to dinner at my house!

14:08.773 --> 14:11.199
Uh, yeah, I'm gonna take a rain check.

14:11.276 --> 14:14.327
So many checks, so little rain.

14:14.796 --> 14:16.371
Stop this revelry!

14:16.422 --> 14:18.131
Who are you?!

14:20.118 --> 14:22.093
Reverend Lovejoy!

14:22.170 --> 14:25.505
And I'm just back from Michigan.

14:25.582 --> 14:27.265
Can you point accusingly for me?

14:27.342 --> 14:29.267
You got it.

14:29.344 --> 14:31.511
This man is a heretic.

14:32.755 --> 14:35.265
Oh, no. No, Lisa, don't.

14:35.275 --> 14:36.641
Wait, wait, wait!

14:36.718 --> 14:40.103
Surely, we know the reverend
is a blessed man who...

14:40.113 --> 14:42.105
Lisa, I did something bad.

14:42.115 --> 14:44.941
How bad could it be? Seriously.

14:45.786 --> 14:47.193
Well, look at you,

14:47.270 --> 14:50.121
finally paying attention to me.

14:50.198 --> 14:52.365
One brief announcement:
there's a red Honda Civic

14:52.442 --> 14:55.460
- in the parking lot with its lights on.
- You're losing them.

14:55.537 --> 14:58.413
He burned the Bible.

15:02.711 --> 15:03.918
Oh, boy.

15:03.995 --> 15:05.328
That's appalling. I mean, come on.

15:05.330 --> 15:07.630
Psalms are not for burning.
They're for tattoos.

15:07.641 --> 15:09.591
So, you know, you sicken me.

15:09.667 --> 15:12.302
Everything in my heart
tells me this isn't true!

15:12.312 --> 15:14.479
I know this is a weird
thing to say in church,

15:14.556 --> 15:16.264
but we need proof.

15:16.341 --> 15:19.551
I demand a full hearing
in front of all of us!

15:19.552 --> 15:21.394
Oh, you'll get your hearing.

15:21.471 --> 15:23.771
Tuesday at 4:00.

15:23.848 --> 15:26.825
Another paradise lost.

15:26.902 --> 15:30.320
Lisa, you're really bringing
down the first Sunday of Lent.

15:30.330 --> 15:33.331
Even the fire eater is sad.

15:38.299 --> 15:41.506
The crisis of faith grows as
support for im-preach-ment

15:41.583 --> 15:42.832
is now at 52%.

15:42.843 --> 15:45.084
Can you fight fire with firing?

15:45.161 --> 15:48.087
What should we do with
this Judas priest?

15:48.164 --> 15:49.681
This has been Kent Brockman talking,

15:49.758 --> 15:51.424
saying nothing.

15:51.501 --> 15:53.393
_

15:55.096 --> 15:56.112
Oh.

15:57.840 --> 16:00.266
Welcome, all of you. Let's begin.

16:00.343 --> 16:02.435
Why is <i> she</i> running this?

16:02.512 --> 16:04.437
Because she won't get overexcited.

16:04.514 --> 16:07.106
And <i> I</i> will?!

16:07.183 --> 16:10.201
And the Bible said,
"A child shall lead them."

16:10.278 --> 16:13.154
Well, as my Lord Buddha said,

16:13.231 --> 16:15.281
"Three things cannot long be hidden.

16:15.358 --> 16:18.718
The sun, the moon, and the truth."

16:18.810 --> 16:21.037
Well, why don't they make that
a Google Doodle?

16:21.048 --> 16:23.998
Reverend,
you're very concerned with the Bible.

16:24.075 --> 16:26.217
So, let us turn to that Bible.

16:26.294 --> 16:29.295
Specifically, the very, very, many parts

16:29.372 --> 16:31.881
that speak about forgiveness.

16:37.547 --> 16:41.182
And, Mom, thank you
for sewing these banners.

16:41.259 --> 16:44.227
I did all that work
for a ten-second bit?

16:44.237 --> 16:45.895
He did it. He admitted it.

16:45.906 --> 16:47.739
What else do you need?

16:47.816 --> 16:49.691
We've mobbed for less, people.

16:49.767 --> 16:52.318
Yeah, remember the guy with the
two different-colored socks?

16:52.395 --> 16:54.079
Ran his ass right out of town.

16:54.155 --> 16:55.571
Banish him!

16:55.582 --> 16:58.992
Banish him! Banish him!

16:59.068 --> 17:02.036
Cherish him! Cherish him!

17:02.113 --> 17:04.539
I know another long-haired performer

17:04.615 --> 17:06.249
who preached a new philosophy,

17:06.259 --> 17:07.709
peace and love.

17:07.785 --> 17:09.252
And the crowd was with him,

17:09.262 --> 17:11.087
but then they turned, hard.

17:11.098 --> 17:13.047
And that man's name

17:13.124 --> 17:14.924
was Willie Nelson!

17:14.935 --> 17:18.269
Well, I say, banish him! Banish him!

17:18.346 --> 17:20.939
Banish him! Banish him!

17:21.016 --> 17:22.773
Stop!

17:22.851 --> 17:25.768
I came here to unify you,
but instead I divided you.

17:25.779 --> 17:27.278
So I'm leaving.

17:27.355 --> 17:30.115
I just hope what I said
resonated with a few of you.

17:30.191 --> 17:32.369
Like Lisa, one who may change the world.

17:32.404 --> 17:33.443
Aw.

17:33.453 --> 17:36.779
And that Sea Captain guy.
That dude is surprisingly woke.

17:36.790 --> 17:40.408
Yarr, activism means nothing
if it's not intersectional.

17:40.485 --> 17:41.501
Yarr!

17:42.704 --> 17:44.203
Glad to have known you.

17:44.280 --> 17:47.915
I just want to say,
you've changed my life forever.

17:47.992 --> 17:50.293
You're the first minister I've ever met

17:50.303 --> 17:52.137
I didn't want to slap across the face.

17:52.213 --> 17:54.130
Glad to have known you.

17:54.141 --> 17:56.883
And I just want to say,
rot in Hell, Bible burner.

17:56.959 --> 17:58.643
Glad to have known you.

17:58.720 --> 18:00.136
- Glad to have...
- Bup-bup-bup.

18:00.147 --> 18:02.930
In my family,
you don't say goodbye to someone

18:03.007 --> 18:05.308
you care about without a meat loaf.

18:05.318 --> 18:07.152
And broccoli.

18:07.228 --> 18:09.270
You-You're inviting me over for dinner?

18:09.347 --> 18:11.064
If you can love us after seeing us eat,

18:11.140 --> 18:13.107
we'll know you really love us.

18:13.184 --> 18:15.109
Come on, pal. We're having roast Bible.

18:15.186 --> 18:16.235
Huh?

18:17.330 --> 18:18.654
What? Too soon?

18:19.891 --> 18:22.167
I just want to offer this simple prayer:

18:22.285 --> 18:24.660
Dear God,
please let the Simpsons never end.

18:24.671 --> 18:26.579
Amen.

18:26.656 --> 18:28.956
And, Bode, tomorrow I have to ask you

18:29.033 --> 18:32.177
a philosophical question,
so I'll see you at the church.

18:33.204 --> 18:34.754
Amen.

18:34.831 --> 18:36.139
Where the hell have you been?

18:36.140 --> 18:37.440
_

18:37.608 --> 18:39.509
Why would you burn a Bible?

18:39.519 --> 18:41.677
Why couldn't you burn
Bill O'Reilly's books?

18:41.688 --> 18:43.688
There are so many.

18:43.765 --> 18:46.140
I was trying to tell people
that God is in your heart,

18:46.217 --> 18:49.027
not in a overbuilt
cathedral or some book.

18:49.104 --> 18:50.937
This town doesn't get subtext.

18:51.013 --> 18:54.482
Our NPR station broadcasts wrestling.

18:54.559 --> 18:56.984
<i>And that's an excruciating half nelson.</i>

18:57.061 --> 19:00.371
<i>Now, is that what's known in
the lexicon as a "face stomp"?</i>

19:00.448 --> 19:02.757
<i>Yes, yes, it is.</i>

19:02.771 --> 19:05.785
<i>This is NPR pledge week. Please give.</i>

19:05.862 --> 19:08.329
- Why did you do it?
- I was 19.

19:08.406 --> 19:12.291
I saw how people were using
the Bible to divide and exclude.

19:12.368 --> 19:14.877
People were so busy
worshipping a road map

19:14.888 --> 19:17.839
instead of trying to
reach the destination.

19:17.915 --> 19:19.265
You know what I mean?

19:20.009 --> 19:22.009
Well, why didn't you just say that?

19:22.086 --> 19:24.395
That was fine. No fire.

19:24.472 --> 19:27.807
- I was 19.
- I'm eight and I get it.

19:28.402 --> 19:31.569
You're right. I've regretted it
since the day I did it.

19:31.646 --> 19:33.479
So, since then,
I've just wandered the world,

19:33.556 --> 19:36.399
like a millennial on a gap year.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.993
I understand,
but how are you gonna convince...?

19:39.701 --> 19:41.894
_

19:41.949 --> 19:44.249
I'll just have faith in
this town's open heart.

19:46.611 --> 19:49.162
I was just making sure it doesn't say
"We forgive you."

19:49.238 --> 19:51.581
- It doesn't.
- Unless they wrote it in red.

19:51.591 --> 19:52.498
Yeah, no.

19:52.575 --> 19:54.092
- No, they didn't.
- No.

19:54.169 --> 19:56.335
- The brick <i> is</i> the message.
- Them's my people.

19:56.412 --> 19:57.545
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:57.622 --> 19:59.398
Do we throw it back? What's your custom?

20:03.102 --> 20:07.054
Uh, Chief, this guy still
had ten minutes on his meter.

20:07.131 --> 20:09.941
Just when I understood that guy,
when I believed again,

20:10.018 --> 20:12.727
when I believed in people,
they took him away.

20:12.803 --> 20:15.021
I've lost my faith, Lou.

20:15.097 --> 20:17.106
Come on, Chief, you got a beautiful wife

20:17.117 --> 20:19.117
And kid... I can't...

20:19.194 --> 20:22.403
I'm sorry, I can't say that
with a straight face.

20:22.480 --> 20:24.056
Well, you could try.

20:24.291 --> 20:27.959
I am. I-I'm trying, I'm sorry.

20:28.036 --> 20:29.452
I'm sorry. I'll maybe try again.

20:29.462 --> 20:31.129
You got a beau...

20:31.206 --> 20:34.081
...tiful wife and kid.

21:20.347 --> 21:21.930
Shh!
