WEBVTT

00:01.710 --> 00:03.246
What happened to your arm,
Doctor?

00:03.378 --> 00:04.789
That is no concern of yours.

00:04.922 --> 00:06.333
Why can't you do
what you yourself

00:06.465 --> 00:07.705
demand of others
and be honest?

00:07.841 --> 00:09.628
Because you're a coward.

00:12.054 --> 00:14.137
You weren't responsible
for her death.

00:14.264 --> 00:16.381
Who, then, if not me?

00:16.517 --> 00:18.600
This wretched investigation
is over.

00:18.727 --> 00:21.390
Dr. Kreizler's withdrawn
because he's been hurt,

00:21.522 --> 00:22.763
but we have a duty to go on.

00:22.898 --> 00:25.311
But we don't have the knowledge
or the know-how.

00:25.442 --> 00:27.399
We have a name.
We have a suspect.

00:27.528 --> 00:28.728
All we have to do is find him.

00:28.820 --> 00:31.358
Still trying to be a detective,
are you, Miss Howard?

00:31.490 --> 00:33.777
Get out of my way.

00:33.909 --> 00:36.117
The man we're looking for,
he might have a job

00:36.245 --> 00:39.283
that allows him to get close
to you boys and win your trust.

00:39.414 --> 00:41.952
Tall fella.
Facial tic.

00:42.084 --> 00:44.747
Three-story house,
second floor.

00:45.754 --> 00:47.586
Today.

00:49.716 --> 00:50.752
We may be too late.

01:51.695 --> 01:53.687
Excuse me.

02:15.427 --> 02:17.009
Joseph...

02:18.805 --> 02:20.046
Where is he?

02:53.590 --> 02:55.923
Has anyone seen
the commissioner?

03:07.729 --> 03:09.595
Excuse me, Commissioner.

03:09.731 --> 03:12.314
You should know that the body of
the boy found in the bathhouse

03:12.442 --> 03:14.479
is being transported
to Bellevue.

03:16.988 --> 03:18.883
The mayor felt it would
be better to have it there

03:18.907 --> 03:20.443
where it can be viewed
in peace.

03:25.997 --> 03:28.660
He's also concerned
that your presence may

03:28.792 --> 03:31.250
inflame the situation.

03:32.254 --> 03:33.745
When I was out West,

03:33.880 --> 03:38.295
I dreamed of returning
to New York one day a hero...

03:40.137 --> 03:43.255
...who rid the city
of corruption

03:43.390 --> 03:45.757
and stopped murderers,

03:45.892 --> 03:48.350
not a bureaucrat
shackled to a desk.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.972
The last thing
an honest politician can expect

03:52.107 --> 03:53.894
is gratitude,

03:54.025 --> 03:55.857
if I may quote you.

03:58.530 --> 04:01.193
We know his name.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.236
We know where he lives.

04:04.661 --> 04:06.527
We're close, sir.

04:07.456 --> 04:09.493
Not close enough.

04:09.624 --> 04:10.956
Clear the way, please.

04:11.084 --> 04:14.577
Move along there.

05:14.648 --> 05:15.980
Joseph is still missing.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.311
He was turned out on the streets
because of me.

05:23.448 --> 05:24.529
I gave him money,

05:24.658 --> 05:27.116
but it never crossed my mind
to take him in.

05:27.244 --> 05:29.156
You're not to blame, John.

05:29.287 --> 05:31.028
Of course I am.

05:33.458 --> 05:34.949
God put him in my way,

05:35.085 --> 05:37.122
and I failed him
like everyone else.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.541
You know,
until yesterday, I...

05:43.677 --> 05:46.715
I felt sympathy for Beecham.

05:48.473 --> 05:51.466
I thought
I finally understood him.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.809
We can't understand him.

05:53.937 --> 05:57.430
Neither you nor I nor anyone.

05:57.566 --> 06:00.104
Not even your friend Kreizler.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.655
When you said that
you were in love with him,

06:09.786 --> 06:11.277
did you mean it?

06:11.413 --> 06:13.245
I imagine I was teasing you.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.707
I think I'm in love with you.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.456
There you go again, John Moore.

06:20.589 --> 06:24.299
I know it's embarrassing
to speak of such things,

06:24.426 --> 06:26.418
that we should keep them
to ourselves

06:26.553 --> 06:29.637
and abide by the codes
that keep us civilized.

06:29.764 --> 06:33.132
But how can we be civilized

06:33.268 --> 06:36.761
when we've experienced
something like this?

06:37.606 --> 06:40.599
Turn me down, by all means...

06:42.569 --> 06:45.937
...but don't pretend
I have no feelings for you.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.939
Any news?

07:30.075 --> 07:33.614
John believes another boy
may be missing.

07:36.831 --> 07:38.618
And what about Laszlo?

07:44.255 --> 07:45.712
I've made
my life's work

07:45.840 --> 07:49.049
the study of the human mind.

07:49.177 --> 07:51.794
And yet now,
my own mind deceives me.

07:56.685 --> 08:00.645
I have cause to hate God
for what he did to her, and...

08:01.773 --> 08:04.686
...yet I find myself
believing in him...

08:07.487 --> 08:10.025
...humbled by
his awful mystery.

08:23.294 --> 08:24.910
Forgive me.

08:27.298 --> 08:29.335
Forgive me too
if I pried into matters

08:29.467 --> 08:33.131
that were not my concern.

08:33.263 --> 08:36.347
I only did it
out of regard for you.

08:57.829 --> 08:59.286
My father...

09:04.002 --> 09:06.244
My father had two sides...

09:07.922 --> 09:11.415
...one loving
and the other brutal,

09:11.551 --> 09:14.214
the two often coexisting.

09:14.345 --> 09:17.179
It was something as trivial
as putting me to bed,

09:17.307 --> 09:18.718
I recall.

09:20.769 --> 09:24.433
A game of tug of war.
We were laughing.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.276
I don't remember
if he was drunk

09:35.408 --> 09:38.242
or if I said something
that offended him.

09:38.369 --> 09:41.783
He must have pulled my arm
behind my back.

09:51.049 --> 09:52.485
In small children,

09:52.509 --> 09:54.671
fractures can often affect...

10:05.522 --> 10:09.311
My father kept a great deal
hidden from me...

10:13.530 --> 10:17.069
...which is why I'm overly
inquisitive, I suppose.

10:19.994 --> 10:23.954
As a child, I was unaware
of my father's melancholia.

10:27.669 --> 10:30.537
But it became
so overwhelming

10:30.672 --> 10:33.005
that he tried
to take his own life.

10:35.426 --> 10:37.509
I was the one who found him.

10:43.393 --> 10:47.512
At the last moment,
he'd lost his courage

10:47.647 --> 10:50.105
and tried to pull the gun
from his mouth.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.903
He was in terrible pain.

10:57.282 --> 10:58.944
Half his face...

11:02.537 --> 11:05.655
He took my hand,

11:05.790 --> 11:08.453
and we held the gun together...

11:14.257 --> 11:16.419
I'm sorry, Sara.

11:19.429 --> 11:21.136
I've learnt from you...

11:23.183 --> 11:26.676
...we can either let it haunt us
for the rest of our lives...

11:28.438 --> 11:30.430
...or we can accept it...

11:32.025 --> 11:33.919
...and use
the memory of our pain

11:33.943 --> 11:35.434
to help others.

11:40.116 --> 11:43.609
I'm not sure the choice
is entirely in our hands.

11:44.621 --> 11:46.408
I disagree.

11:48.541 --> 11:51.204
If it weren't,
we'd all be murderers.

11:54.589 --> 11:57.332
We were hoping
you'd change your mind.

12:09.354 --> 12:12.392
Stevie, prepare the carriage
for Dr. Kreizler.

12:12.523 --> 12:13.604
That won't be necessary.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.441
I've not asked
to be taken anywhere.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.356
I meant no offense, sir.

12:18.488 --> 12:22.482
Nor I, Cyrus.
But I intend to walk.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.578
Where was the body?

12:34.545 --> 12:36.832
This isn't
where he was killed.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.545
Not here.

13:01.072 --> 13:03.359
Describe the wounds.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.119
Here.

13:09.038 --> 13:10.245
Here.

13:10.373 --> 13:12.205
A large cut?

13:12.333 --> 13:14.199
- Gaping?
- Yes, sir.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.621
And the eyes?

13:15.753 --> 13:18.211
Were the eyes missing?

13:18.339 --> 13:21.423
No, sir.
They was there.

13:21.551 --> 13:24.385
Pale from being in the water,
but they was there.

13:24.512 --> 13:26.549
Staring up at me, they was.

13:26.681 --> 13:28.513
I'll never forget it.

14:41.589 --> 14:43.956
Dr. Kreizler.

14:44.092 --> 14:45.754
Detective Sergeant.

14:53.101 --> 14:56.435
Dr. Kreizler.
Good to see you, sir.

15:19.043 --> 15:22.252
Much of the organic evidence
was taken away for analysis.

15:38.312 --> 15:42.397
A chart of the city's
sewage and water system.

15:42.525 --> 15:46.018
Beecham probably stole it
from the public records office.

15:50.241 --> 15:52.733
We suspect Beecham knows
we're watching the rooftops,

15:52.869 --> 15:55.031
so he's using the sewers
to get around.

15:59.834 --> 16:01.666
What is it?

16:03.546 --> 16:05.128
Water.

16:05.256 --> 16:06.417
Yes, sir.

16:06.549 --> 16:08.669
We considered that since
the Feast of John the Baptist

16:08.801 --> 16:10.417
is only 10 days away.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.296
You don't believe
there is a connection?

16:14.432 --> 16:16.640
Not to the previous murders.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.471
Do you think it has
a different purpose?

16:22.607 --> 16:24.974
No, I believe you're right.

16:40.541 --> 16:42.123
May I have a moment alone?

17:02.605 --> 17:05.222
<i>A chart of the city's
sewage and water system.</i>

17:05.358 --> 17:07.474
...<i>the Feast
of John the Baptist</i>

17:07.609 --> 17:09.317
<i>is only 10 days away.</i>

17:11.571 --> 17:13.233
<i>Water.</i>

17:28.673 --> 17:31.256
...<i>intimate nature
of so many other aspects.</i>

18:50.379 --> 18:51.699
Each of the murders
were committed

18:51.756 --> 18:54.794
within sight of a body of water,
like a river or a public bath.

18:54.925 --> 18:57.258
At first, I assumed
this map of the water system

18:57.386 --> 18:59.878
had something to do with him
using the sewers to move around,

19:00.014 --> 19:02.882
but now I'm not so sure.

19:03.017 --> 19:04.474
"I baptize you with water,

19:04.602 --> 19:07.140
but someone is coming soon
who is greater than I am."

19:07.271 --> 19:09.228
Luke 3:16.

19:09.357 --> 19:10.518
John the Baptist.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.141
What of him?

19:12.276 --> 19:15.360
I believe it's why he took
the name John, replacing George,

19:15.488 --> 19:17.855
but keeping the name
of the man who assaulted him.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.197
Beecham.

19:19.325 --> 19:21.362
We know heights
are important to him.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.531
The mountains are
where he found modest relief.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.404
But I'm beginning to think
that water,

19:25.539 --> 19:28.452
in the form of purification,
plays an equally important role

19:28.584 --> 19:30.826
in his morbid...

19:30.961 --> 19:32.293
His morbid what?

19:33.297 --> 19:34.788
Ritual.

19:34.924 --> 19:36.881
It's only a theory,

19:37.009 --> 19:38.796
but I believe Beecham
used this map

19:38.928 --> 19:42.171
to select the location
for his next murder.

19:42.306 --> 19:45.640
The Feast of John the Baptist.
It's six days from now.

19:45.768 --> 19:48.511
We don't have much time.
We need your help.

19:48.646 --> 19:50.854
Where to begin?

19:50.981 --> 19:52.438
High Bridge Tower.

19:52.566 --> 19:53.794
It's the highest point
in the city.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.157
How much are they?

20:10.418 --> 20:12.250
Good morning, Marcus.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.336
Esther.

20:19.468 --> 20:21.460
May I speak with you?

20:21.595 --> 20:22.739
I'm afraid my brother and I
are in a hurry...

20:22.763 --> 20:23.924
I can wait.

20:28.602 --> 20:31.515
I didn't sleep with you
to try and trick you

20:31.647 --> 20:33.434
or force you
to look after my child.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.933
You know,
I can earn my own living.

20:36.068 --> 20:39.857
But what I don't want is to be
alone for the rest of my life

20:39.989 --> 20:42.106
because a man
I was foolish enough to marry

20:42.241 --> 20:44.984
was too cowardly
to face up to his duties.

20:46.078 --> 20:50.038
I'm sorry for what happened
to you, Esther, truly.

20:50.166 --> 20:53.204
But I'm not ready to take care
of you or your child.

20:53.335 --> 20:56.749
I ain't askin'
for your charity.

20:58.966 --> 21:01.674
I'm only asking that
you not cross the street

21:01.802 --> 21:03.668
every time you see me.

21:27.828 --> 21:29.347
...the murders are in service

21:29.371 --> 21:32.910
to some kind of
psychological gratification.

21:35.252 --> 21:37.710
There you are, John.

21:37.838 --> 21:40.626
Laszlo was just
explaining the difference

21:40.758 --> 21:45.048
between a common murderer
and a multimurderer.

21:45.179 --> 21:46.340
Laszlo now, is it?

21:47.848 --> 21:49.259
Please tell me
you haven't come here

21:49.391 --> 21:50.802
just to frighten
my grandmother.

21:50.935 --> 21:55.179
I'm not the least bit
frightened by these psychopaths.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.687
Actually, John, I've come here
to invite you to the opera.

21:59.819 --> 22:00.980
The opera?

22:01.111 --> 22:04.570
Yes. The 24th.
It's "Don Giovanni."

22:06.033 --> 22:08.400
You are aware of
the importance of that day?

22:08.536 --> 22:11.654
It's the Feast
of John the Baptist.

22:11.789 --> 22:13.451
Once a Catholic...

22:16.252 --> 22:18.039
I'm afraid I have
a prior engagement

22:18.170 --> 22:20.162
with Miss Howard
and Commissioner Roosevelt.

22:20.297 --> 22:22.459
It'll keep me occupied
most of the evening.

22:22.591 --> 22:25.959
Perhaps you'd care to join us?

22:26.095 --> 22:28.508
Perhaps after the opera.

22:29.598 --> 22:32.136
May I suggest
we skip the opera?

22:32.268 --> 22:34.726
Unfortunately,
that won't be possible.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.095
Our presence is required

22:36.230 --> 22:38.517
as a necessary prelude
to later events.

22:38.649 --> 22:40.185
How so?

22:43.237 --> 22:48.449
Certain "followers of my work"
will expect us there.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.626
Shall we say
half past 7:00, then?

23:30.409 --> 23:32.526
Ohh...

23:34.330 --> 23:37.573
You're dirtier than a savage.

23:37.708 --> 23:41.247
She only loved me
when she bathed me.

23:41.378 --> 23:42.585
She washed me.

23:42.713 --> 23:45.296
You deserve
it.

23:45.424 --> 23:46.756
So pretty.

23:46.884 --> 23:49.126
Look at the little bird
in its nest.

23:49.261 --> 23:51.628
So pretty,
I'm gonna snip it off.

23:53.641 --> 23:55.428
You deserve it.

23:55.559 --> 23:58.848
I love you so much.

24:23.087 --> 24:25.204
I wanted to apologize.

24:25.798 --> 24:28.632
I'm sorry
if I was discourteous.

24:28.759 --> 24:30.170
Thank you.

24:37.726 --> 24:39.683
Okay.

25:14.555 --> 25:17.673
John Schuyler Moore!

25:17.808 --> 25:19.640
Jack Astor.

25:19.768 --> 25:21.885
Rather underdressed, aren't you?

25:22.021 --> 25:24.513
Has it started?

25:24.648 --> 25:26.435
Oh, nobody bothers
with Act One.

25:26.567 --> 25:29.856
The fun only begins when
Don Giovanni seduces the ladies.

25:29.987 --> 25:33.355
Something with which
you're quite familiar.

25:33.490 --> 25:36.449
If you're referring
to Julia Pratt,

25:36.577 --> 25:38.159
I believe you're more familiar
than I.

25:38.287 --> 25:41.405
Come on, now, old man.
Let's have a drink.

25:45.836 --> 25:49.500
If I still drank, old man,

25:49.631 --> 25:51.918
I would prefer to drink alone
rather than with you.

26:24.917 --> 26:27.580
I remain baffled as
to why I'm attending the opera

26:27.711 --> 26:29.748
on a night as important as this.

26:29.880 --> 26:31.746
Where are the others?

26:31.882 --> 26:34.499
Roosevelt's watching
Brooklyn Bridge,

26:34.635 --> 26:36.752
and Sara and the Isaacsons
are expecting us

26:36.887 --> 26:37.923
at High Bridge Tower.

26:38.055 --> 26:39.887
It's best we leave now.

26:43.018 --> 26:45.761
Laszlo, we've got to go.

26:45.896 --> 26:48.559
Come on! Hyah!

26:51.360 --> 26:53.818
Detective Sergeants.

27:04.540 --> 27:06.577
- Oh! Whoa now!
- Whoa now! Whoa!

27:12.965 --> 27:15.799
They're all out there tonight.

27:15.926 --> 27:18.543
The guardians
of the social order.

27:18.679 --> 27:20.511
Box 16.

27:25.477 --> 27:26.888
You meant it when you said

27:27.020 --> 27:29.103
certain
"followers of your work."

27:30.482 --> 27:31.939
Byrnes.

27:41.702 --> 27:43.443
What did Mr. Moore
tell you exactly?

27:43.579 --> 27:45.306
That he
and Dr. Kreizler would join us

27:45.330 --> 27:46.410
just as soon as they could.

27:53.839 --> 27:55.501
There's still time.

28:06.143 --> 28:08.351
He's not
taken his eyes off us.

28:37.341 --> 28:42.177
♪ Don Giovanni! ♪

28:42.304 --> 28:48.426
<i>♪ A cenar teco ♪</i>

28:48.560 --> 28:53.555
<i>♪ M'invitasti... ♪</i>

28:54.733 --> 28:57.100
Would you kindly see if there's
anyone in the corridor?

29:14.253 --> 29:16.916
- There's no one.
- Excellent.

29:47.536 --> 29:50.700
Now, John.
Let's go.

30:31.997 --> 30:34.364
When Dr. Kreizler
visited Beecham's rooms,

30:34.499 --> 30:35.740
what did you discuss?

30:35.876 --> 30:39.335
I told him about the eyes,

30:39.463 --> 30:40.874
the heart in the box.

30:41.006 --> 30:43.168
Was there anything else
he seemed interested in?

30:43.300 --> 30:45.212
Hyah!

30:45.344 --> 30:48.633
This isn't the right way
to the High Bridge Tower.

30:48.764 --> 30:50.676
We're not going to High Bridge.

30:50.807 --> 30:53.174
The map
of the city water system.

30:53.310 --> 30:55.427
Do you have the map with you?

30:55.562 --> 30:58.145
Sara and the Isaacsons
are waiting for us there.

30:58.273 --> 31:01.016
Half the city's police force
is staking out the place.

31:01.151 --> 31:02.391
Then they shall be
disappointed.

31:02.444 --> 31:03.980
What the hell
are you talking about?

31:04.112 --> 31:06.604
He didn't take the eyes
this time.

31:06.740 --> 31:09.323
Conscious or not, his focus
was on something else.

31:09.451 --> 31:12.740
He's changing.
The ritual is changing.

31:19.127 --> 31:22.495
Think, John.
What did you find in his rooms?

31:22.631 --> 31:23.547
A map.

31:23.548 --> 31:25.289
The map on its own
tells us nothing.

31:25.425 --> 31:26.632
The box
with the child's heart.

31:26.760 --> 31:27.841
Not a child's heart.

31:27.969 --> 31:30.712
Someone older,
someone close to him.

31:31.973 --> 31:32.973
His mother.

31:33.100 --> 31:35.638
It's not only love that
resides in the heart, John.

31:35.769 --> 31:37.135
It's pain.

31:40.273 --> 31:43.266
I'm going to see if I can find
out what's happened to them.

31:47.781 --> 31:50.444
- You made me lie to them.
- I had no choice.

31:50.575 --> 31:52.553
If the police were to get
their hands on Beecham...

31:52.577 --> 31:54.864
But Roosevelt trusted you.
We all trusted you!

32:58.685 --> 33:00.722
Help! Help me!

33:02.189 --> 33:03.896
Joseph. Joseph!

33:04.024 --> 33:05.731
Help!

33:21.333 --> 33:23.074
Joseph!

33:37.390 --> 33:38.676
Joseph!

33:58.870 --> 34:00.532
Joseph.

34:11.882 --> 34:12.882
Is he all right?

34:13.009 --> 34:16.592
Yes.
Thank God.

34:17.722 --> 34:18.556
Joseph.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.264
Joseph.

34:20.391 --> 34:22.349
It's me... John Moore.

34:22.476 --> 34:23.746
Listen to me.

34:23.770 --> 34:26.137
You're safe now.

34:26.273 --> 34:27.559
You're safe.

35:09.149 --> 35:10.936
Hey, Laszlo?

35:30.378 --> 35:31.835
Laszlo?

35:51.691 --> 35:52.977
Aah!

36:05.622 --> 36:08.114
Hyah!

36:16.091 --> 36:17.207
Japheth.

36:41.116 --> 36:43.278
I could take your eyes.

36:46.955 --> 36:50.119
But I want you to see.

36:53.962 --> 36:55.123
Aah!

36:56.297 --> 36:58.254
Stay there.

37:09.936 --> 37:12.269
I know who you are.

37:14.941 --> 37:16.807
I know
what's been done to you.

37:16.943 --> 37:19.276
You don't know anything.

37:19.404 --> 37:21.066
Nor does the child.

37:21.197 --> 37:24.281
He had nothing to do with
what your mother did to you!

37:25.869 --> 37:29.033
He's as innocent
as you once were.

37:29.164 --> 37:31.030
Killing him
won't rid you of her.

37:34.544 --> 37:36.786
You think that's why?

37:36.921 --> 37:37.921
Japheth.

37:41.426 --> 37:42.666
Where do you think
you're going?

37:42.761 --> 37:43.761
No!

37:52.145 --> 37:55.559
Looks like I walked in
on a bloodbath.

37:56.900 --> 37:59.688
Yeah.
Covered myself in glory.

38:02.572 --> 38:05.064
A terrible bloodbath
it is too.

38:07.327 --> 38:10.240
All these poor people dead.

38:12.957 --> 38:16.576
And me just too late

38:16.711 --> 38:18.998
to save 'em from a madman.

38:25.136 --> 38:27.844
Well, if it isn't Miss Howard.

38:32.352 --> 38:37.768
The first woman to work for
the New York Police Department.

38:43.696 --> 38:45.358
'Tis no business for a lady.

38:45.490 --> 38:50.861
Especially one as delicate
and lovely as yourself.

39:26.865 --> 39:28.572
Japheth.

39:28.700 --> 39:31.943
John. John!

39:35.164 --> 39:36.405
Damn it!

39:38.793 --> 39:41.456
Joseph. Joseph.

39:43.756 --> 39:45.122
It's okay.

40:26.591 --> 40:28.708
Can you hear me, Japheth?

40:36.643 --> 40:38.555
What made you kill them?

40:40.813 --> 40:42.896
Tell me why, Japheth.

40:44.567 --> 40:46.058
Why?

40:50.073 --> 40:51.939
Why?

40:53.660 --> 40:54.901
Japheth.

40:59.540 --> 41:02.908
Japheth. Japheth.

41:03.044 --> 41:04.205
Japheth!

41:07.048 --> 41:08.380
Japheth!

41:34.867 --> 41:37.359
Tell me what happened
with Captain Connor.

41:39.330 --> 41:40.821
He left me no choice.

41:42.500 --> 41:44.537
He would have killed us all.

41:47.880 --> 41:49.587
I shot Captain Connor, sir.

42:01.561 --> 42:04.895
You've always had the courage
to do what's needed to be done.

42:07.567 --> 42:10.059
Your father
would be proud of you.

42:58.117 --> 43:02.828
In every way, a perfectly normal
and healthy brain.

43:03.790 --> 43:08.080
What does that prove?
That he wasn't insane?

43:08.211 --> 43:11.670
It proves
we don't know anything.

43:11.798 --> 43:14.541
God works between the lines.

43:16.260 --> 43:18.297
Just think what you achieved,

43:18.429 --> 43:21.547
finding a killer with
no connection to his victims.

43:23.726 --> 43:26.434
I wonder how long
he would have stayed hidden.

43:28.564 --> 43:31.477
Somewhere inside, I believe
he wanted society to know

43:31.609 --> 43:33.976
he's its tormented offspring.

43:35.196 --> 43:37.313
A living reminder
of all the crimes we commit

43:37.448 --> 43:39.030
behind closed doors.

43:39.158 --> 43:41.696
What matters is
you stopped a monster.

43:43.037 --> 43:45.996
We set out to find a monster,

43:46.124 --> 43:49.208
but all we found
was a wounded child.

43:53.673 --> 43:56.040
Forgive me, but...

43:57.718 --> 43:59.550
I'm exhausted.

44:01.806 --> 44:04.844
I know how badly
you wanted him alive.

44:06.060 --> 44:09.929
The Jesse Pomeroys
and Japheth Durys of this world

44:10.064 --> 44:13.648
will take their secrets
to the grave.

44:13.776 --> 44:16.644
But there will be others,
I have no doubt.

44:16.779 --> 44:18.691
And from them,
we might one day learn

44:18.823 --> 44:21.110
what compels a man
to do evil.

44:22.660 --> 44:24.276
And to do good.

44:25.830 --> 44:27.571
And to do good.

45:06.078 --> 45:07.798
...and although Captain Connor
was no longer

45:07.872 --> 45:10.535
serving with
the police department,

45:10.666 --> 45:15.752
his adherence to the moral code
he once devoted his life to

45:15.880 --> 45:18.793
saw him act
in a most brave and...

45:19.967 --> 45:22.129
...honorable manner.

45:22.762 --> 45:24.344
We can credit good police work

45:24.472 --> 45:26.179
to putting an end to the horror
that has

45:26.307 --> 45:28.924
plagued our city
these past four months.

45:31.312 --> 45:35.727
It is my pleasure to present
this Medal of Commendation

45:35.858 --> 45:40.444
to the family
Captain Connor left behind.

45:49.205 --> 45:51.071
Ten hut!

46:19.235 --> 46:24.276
Regardless of the difficulties
and personal misfortunes,

46:24.407 --> 46:26.273
the past four months
have proved to be

46:26.409 --> 46:28.617
more than
a fruitful partnership.

46:28.744 --> 46:34.490
I daresay what we now share
is friendship.

46:34.625 --> 46:37.993
Then a toast to friendship.

46:38.879 --> 46:41.121
- Friendship.
- Friendship.

46:45.553 --> 46:48.261
Here's to you, here's to me.

46:48.389 --> 46:50.381
May we never disagree.

46:50.516 --> 46:53.680
But if we do, hell with you.

46:53.811 --> 46:54.972
Here's to me.

46:57.398 --> 46:59.185
Cheers.

47:05.865 --> 47:06.946
John.

47:08.576 --> 47:09.987
This was for Mary.

47:14.123 --> 47:17.161
I'll hope you'll find someone
you can give it to.

47:23.132 --> 47:25.089
Thank you, Laszlo.

47:48.032 --> 47:51.196
It's really over now,
isn't it?

47:51.327 --> 47:54.035
You sound disappointed.

47:54.163 --> 47:55.904
I've never had an experience
like this,

47:56.040 --> 47:59.329
and I wonder how many more
I'll be allowed.

47:59.460 --> 48:01.372
Somehow I get the feeling

48:01.504 --> 48:04.793
you're done with people
allowing you to do things.

48:08.803 --> 48:11.386
I meant what I said before.

48:11.514 --> 48:13.927
No, you didn't.

48:14.058 --> 48:16.516
You're in love with
what you don't have.

48:17.895 --> 48:20.057
You're in love
with your dreams.

48:20.189 --> 48:21.600
Aren't you?

48:22.775 --> 48:26.143
Yes.
I suppose I am.

48:26.278 --> 48:28.645
Very well, then.

48:28.781 --> 48:30.818
I shall wait very patiently

48:30.950 --> 48:32.907
until you become
chief of detectives.

48:33.035 --> 48:36.449
In the meantime, let me
accompany you to a carriage.

48:36.580 --> 48:39.288
I'm perfectly safe, thank you.

48:39.417 --> 48:40.953
Cab!

48:42.378 --> 48:43.978
Come on, now.

48:46.841 --> 48:48.082
Whoa.

48:51.512 --> 48:53.629
He won't wait all night.

48:54.890 --> 48:57.473
The 20th century
is almost upon us,

48:57.601 --> 49:01.311
and with it, a bright new future
with bright new ideas.

49:01.439 --> 49:04.477
Why, women might even get
the right to vote.

49:04.608 --> 49:07.396
Washington Square, please.

49:07.528 --> 49:10.271
Hyah!

49:10.406 --> 49:13.399
John Moore,
you just took my cab!

50:10.090 --> 50:12.423
- He's there.
- Thank you.

50:54.802 --> 50:57.010
I've always blamed my failings
as an adult

50:57.137 --> 50:59.971
on what you did to me
as a child.

51:02.184 --> 51:05.768
Those failings were my own.

51:09.817 --> 51:12.651
I remember something
you once said to me.

51:12.778 --> 51:17.443
"Nature never allows a man to
be more than he is. Only less."

51:19.451 --> 51:21.693
For years, I believed
those words reflected

51:21.829 --> 51:24.242
your own bitterness
and failure.

51:25.541 --> 51:28.705
But now I understand
they were for my benefit.

51:30.754 --> 51:33.872
You were simply preparing me
for what you knew would be

51:34.008 --> 51:36.716
a lifetime
of disappointment and pain.

51:41.724 --> 51:43.431
But you were wrong.

51:46.228 --> 51:48.845
I know that now.

51:50.608 --> 51:54.898
I still believe we can be
better than nature intended,

51:55.029 --> 51:57.066
even if you can't.

52:05.080 --> 52:06.992
You did the best you could.

52:19.094 --> 52:22.178
Goodbye, Papi.
