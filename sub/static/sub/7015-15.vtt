00:04.927 --> 00:05.872
Hey, Sarah,

00:06.084 --> 00:08.373
when you and Donna are
alone at the radio station,

00:08.397 --> 00:11.056
do you ever pretend that instead
of being just a regular intern,

00:11.109 --> 00:13.611
that you're, like, a
super naughty intern?

00:16.125 --> 00:20.206
Oh, and that Donna has to teach
you a very naked lesson?

00:22.907 --> 00:25.807
I'll give you 10 bucks and what's
left of my hot dog to say yes.

00:26.782 --> 00:31.066
No, sillies. There's way too much
work to do at the station to daydream.

00:31.101 --> 00:34.072
I mean, I have to take my top
off and sort records, and then

00:34.095 --> 00:37.266
Donna and i have to
french-kiss. It's exhausting.

00:38.839 --> 00:42.085
This is why there should
be more women in the workforce.

00:43.072 --> 00:43.917
Um,

00:44.398 --> 00:46.500
please don't take this
the wrong way,

00:48.308 --> 00:49.976
but I want to
have sex with you.

00:53.619 --> 00:55.333
Sarah's only been
interning for a week,

00:55.368 --> 00:59.137
but the deejays have already let her talk on the
air, and they gave her a really cool nickname...

00:59.302 --> 01:00.758
"Sizzling Sarah."

01:00.793 --> 01:03.235
- Oh, that's terrific! That's onomatopoeia.
- That's good.

01:03.282 --> 01:03.916
It rhymes.

01:04.280 --> 01:07.897
It is so fun. Everyone at
the station's been super nice,

01:07.920 --> 01:09.887
especially the older men.

01:10.016 --> 01:11.730
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

01:12.282 --> 01:14.328
This girl is great.

01:14.378 --> 01:16.276
This girl is great!

01:20.320 --> 01:21.823
That girl is a bitch.

01:24.512 --> 01:26.273
She's Sizzling Sarah
in one week?

01:26.306 --> 01:30.134
It took me six months of sorting records
to become "Hot Donna"... six months.

01:30.182 --> 01:32.561
Uh, no, actually, you've
been Hot Donna

01:32.596 --> 01:35.786
since the fifth grade when you
started cultivating that melon patch.

01:37.860 --> 01:41.805
Don't tell her about the melon patch!
Now she knows our secret code!

01:44.294 --> 01:45.433
Sizzling Sarah.

01:45.643 --> 01:47.206
I don't even know
why they hired her.

01:47.381 --> 01:48.684
She's music-illiterate.

01:49.060 --> 01:52.829
When I asked her if she liked The Police,
she was like,"No, I prefer firemen."

01:54.813 --> 01:57.285
Donna, who cares if
she knows about music?

01:57.326 --> 01:58.794
The girl is freakin' hot!

01:58.829 --> 02:04.110
Yeah, Donna, what you've yet to realize
is that life is a beauty contest.

02:07.607 --> 02:09.925
I mean, you got your
job because you're hot,

02:09.961 --> 02:12.544
and now a new hot girl
is coming and taking your place.

02:12.574 --> 02:14.547
It's survival of the juggiest.

02:16.269 --> 02:19.780
No, I got my job
because I know music.

02:19.815 --> 02:23.314
Yeah, that's why your on-air
nickname is "music-knowing Donna."

02:24.277 --> 02:27.257
Look, Donna, your problem
is you've got too much going on.

02:27.292 --> 02:29.589
I mean, the less you have going on, the
less you have to worry about. Look at me.

02:29.624 --> 02:31.306
I've got nothing going on,

02:32.517 --> 02:34.232
and I've got nothing
to worry about.

02:35.241 --> 02:36.803
Except your future.

02:37.859 --> 02:38.420
Eh.

02:45.454 --> 02:46.369
How's it going?

02:47.963 --> 02:49.759
Horrible! I want you back!

02:49.794 --> 02:52.718
Thank god! I want you
back! In fact, marry me!

02:53.458 --> 02:55.407
Oh, yes, Steven!

02:56.182 --> 02:57.216
Do you, Jackie?

02:57.251 --> 02:58.883
- I do!
- Me too!

02:58.907 --> 03:00.163
Whoo-hoo!
Yeah, baby!

Jackie, I said,
"how's it going?"

03:15.803 --> 03:16.508
Fine.

03:17.611 --> 03:18.703
Everything's fine.

03:22.355 --> 03:24.403
You guys, while I was
in the bathroom,

03:24.426 --> 03:27.467
I realized I totally
forgot to wear a bra today.

03:29.433 --> 03:30.896
I love you.

04:11.450 --> 04:12.284
Steven,

04:12.753 --> 04:17.084
I've noticed that every day you come home
from the record store tired and irritable,

04:17.372 --> 04:18.922
and I just want to say,

04:19.014 --> 04:20.293
welcome to life.

04:23.417 --> 04:24.086
So

04:24.450 --> 04:27.198
what's new in the
world of rock and roll?

04:27.433 --> 04:31.118
'Cause this cool cat wants the
skinny on the be-bop, maestro.

04:33.478 --> 04:34.194
Uh,

04:35.403 --> 04:39.278
well, tomorrow we have Tom Jones coming
in for a record signing at the store.

04:39.315 --> 04:42.344
Tom Jones? I love him!

04:42.966 --> 04:44.056
Oh,

04:44.091 --> 04:46.698
and the way he shakes his hips!

04:47.367 --> 04:50.854
It just makes me feel all
nervous and embarrassed.

04:51.453 --> 04:53.646
Boy, that sounds like fun.

04:54.257 --> 04:56.817
Fun for you, maybe.
You're a middle-aged woman.

04:57.427 --> 04:58.014
What?

04:59.752 --> 05:01.610
Don't "what" me.

05:01.693 --> 05:03.278
The average lifespan is 72,

05:03.301 --> 05:07.317
so if you're older than 36, which you are,
then by definition, you're middle-aged.

05:07.364 --> 05:08.583
Discussion over.

05:09.628 --> 05:11.953
Okay, when you're right, you're right.

05:15.640 --> 05:16.239
Wow.

05:18.033 --> 05:20.592
I win an argument
every six years or so.

05:23.868 --> 05:25.265
Is, um, Steven here?

05:25.288 --> 05:29.328
I'm only asking to make sure he's not
in case he still has feelings for me.

05:30.889 --> 05:33.965
Well, he's not here. He went to a
bar to forget how much he loves you.

05:35.266 --> 05:35.994
Really?

05:36.898 --> 05:38.084
Uh, no, he's at the car wash.

05:42.065 --> 05:43.485
You guys want to hear
something sick?

05:43.509 --> 05:45.221
Ooh, yes. Please, hurry.

05:46.935 --> 05:49.119
Mr. Randall down
at the radio station

05:49.154 --> 05:52.583
wants me to host a live remote from Hyde's
record store when Tom Jones is there.

05:52.630 --> 05:55.160
And to promote it, they
want to put me on a billboard

05:55.196 --> 05:56.652
wearing this.

05:59.951 --> 06:01.348
That's just good radio.

06:03.614 --> 06:04.986
Well, I'm not wearing it.

06:05.044 --> 06:09.025
I should be valued for my voice
and music knowledge, not my body,

06:09.166 --> 06:11.044
no matter how smokin' it is.

06:12.580 --> 06:17.699
There you go again with your "women should
be valued for their minds" gobbledygook.

06:20.353 --> 06:22.936
Donna, women should be
valued for their looks.

06:22.983 --> 06:25.628
Men should be valued
for their cars, and

06:25.675 --> 06:28.176
foreigners should be valued
for their ability to sweep.

06:29.784 --> 06:30.853
Hey, hey!

06:31.863 --> 06:33.925
We also drive
a mean taxi.

06:36.907 --> 06:39.009
I'm not caving to
their smutty demands.

06:39.044 --> 06:42.531
I am an on-air personality.
I am not a sex kitten.

06:43.870 --> 06:47.157
I agree, Donna. Making you wear
that outfit is demeaning to women.

06:47.968 --> 06:49.259
Well, thank you, Fez.

06:49.283 --> 06:51.560
But just to be sure, put
it on and shake your ass.

07:07.543 --> 07:09.503
would you please
quit giggling?

07:09.539 --> 07:14.141
Sorry, man. I'm listening to George Carlin's "seven
dirty words you can't say on radio and television."

07:15.654 --> 07:18.413
Man, he just keeps saying
'em over and over again.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.025
Potty mouth.

07:28.409 --> 07:29.266
Okay,

07:29.829 --> 07:32.847
Tom Jones is booked,
and everything is set.

07:34.714 --> 07:38.764
You know, I don't think there's anything more
exciting than a promotional event gone right.

07:38.999 --> 07:41.500
Then you need to get drunk and
ride a mechanical bull.

07:43.003 --> 07:43.942
You know,

07:44.036 --> 07:47.288
you're being more of a tool than
usual. Have you talked to Jackie?

07:47.460 --> 07:49.550
No, Angie. What do I
have to say to Jackie?

07:49.726 --> 07:51.593
That you love her
and miss her.

07:51.722 --> 07:53.107
I don't love people.

07:55.080 --> 07:59.087
I love Camaros, Zeppelin and
french fries, in that order.

08:01.869 --> 08:04.077
You guys, I just had
this brilliant idea.

08:04.124 --> 08:06.050
You know how every
dirty word has a number?

08:06.097 --> 08:08.116
Instead of cursing, you
could just say that number.

08:08.171 --> 08:10.508
Like, I could say,"Hi,
go three yourself."

08:12.245 --> 08:12.833
Hey,

08:13.150 --> 08:13.819
Angie.

08:14.253 --> 08:17.776
When Tom Jones gets here, you're not gonna
throw your underpants at him, are you?

08:19.005 --> 08:19.827
Michael,

08:20.015 --> 08:22.093
you know I don't
wear underwear.

08:23.197 --> 08:25.216
Come on, man,
you're my sister.

08:25.862 --> 08:28.868
I just told her to say
that to gross you out. Burn!

08:32.860 --> 08:33.940
Yeah, you got me.

08:33.976 --> 08:36.857
Besides, I happen to know that
she does wear underwear.

08:36.893 --> 08:40.134
Sometimes she lets me take 'em
off for her. Boomerang burn!

08:47.237 --> 08:47.942
Oh,

08:49.117 --> 08:50.725
I feel terrible.

08:51.394 --> 08:53.238
I think it's the flu.

08:54.835 --> 08:58.613
Okay, now is this the real flu or
the martini & rossiasti spumante?

09:01.819 --> 09:07.312
Now I'm gonna miss Tom Jones this afternoon,
and I wanted his autograph so badly.

09:09.238 --> 09:11.621
- Red, I was thinking maybe...
- No.

09:14.980 --> 09:19.146
You know, if you were sick, and
Joe Dimaggio was signing footballs,

09:19.193 --> 09:21.013
I'd get an autograph for you.

09:23.643 --> 09:26.684
Mom, Joe Dimaggio played baseball.

09:28.009 --> 09:31.602
that'd be like me saying
G. I. Joe has a karate grip.

09:34.162 --> 09:35.606
What a nerd I'd be.

09:39.925 --> 09:41.651
Hey, Fez, I need your advice.

09:41.686 --> 09:43.154
You should show more leg.

09:47.499 --> 09:48.985
No, I'm serious.

09:49.150 --> 09:51.592
Look, I still love Steven,
and I want him back.

09:51.627 --> 09:53.236
Everything reminds me of him.

09:53.271 --> 09:56.735
Every time I walk past a pile of
dirty laundry, I start crying.

09:58.867 --> 10:01.627
Well, then you should go to
him and tell him how you feel.

10:01.662 --> 10:06.171
I cannot go up to Steven and pour my heart out
to him if I'm not sure he feels the same way.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.803
I couldn't take
the rejection.

10:07.850 --> 10:10.607
Oh, please, I've been
rejected a million times.

10:11.793 --> 10:14.787
And trust me, after
the first hundred or so,

10:14.996 --> 10:16.699
they don't sting
no more, baby.

10:18.566 --> 10:19.984
I wouldn't even know
what to say.

10:21.241 --> 10:25.292
Okay, let's role-play. Pretend I'm Hyde, and
then say everything you want to say to him to me.

10:25.995 --> 10:26.652
Really?

10:27.322 --> 10:27.991
Okay.

10:31.373 --> 10:33.850
Steven, I love you,
and I want you back.

10:34.813 --> 10:36.969
I never thought I would
hear those words, my darling.

10:40.562 --> 10:41.279
Ew!

10:43.016 --> 10:45.294
I'm sorry. I got a little
carried away.

10:45.998 --> 10:48.041
I'll be serious this
time, I promise.

10:54.805 --> 10:55.450
Okay.

10:58.851 --> 11:01.998
I love you, and all I
want is for us to be together.

11:02.174 --> 11:03.712
Oh, get off me, weirdo!

11:04.123 --> 11:07.499
I'm the weirdo? You're the one saying,"I
love you," smack! "I love you," smack!

11:08.356 --> 11:09.554
You little tease!

11:15.860 --> 11:16.658
So

11:16.705 --> 11:19.946
you see, Mr. Randall, I don't think
it's necessary for me to wear a bikini.

11:19.981 --> 11:20.756
I mean,

11:20.885 --> 11:23.034
what is sexier than a
little bit of mystery?

11:23.066 --> 11:25.766
Well, according to my
research, naked boobies.

11:28.843 --> 11:32.224
All right, look, ratings are down,
and I think this could really help.

11:32.541 --> 11:34.879
Well, I'm not gonna strip for
a radio advertisement.

11:34.914 --> 11:35.865
It's demeaning.

11:35.900 --> 11:36.711
I'll do it.

11:38.472 --> 11:39.353
You will?

11:39.400 --> 11:42.171
Yeah, of course she'll do it.
This whole billboard was her idea.

11:43.204 --> 11:43.988
What?

11:44.141 --> 11:47.722
Unlike some people, I
care about this radio station.

11:47.757 --> 11:49.718
Plus, I just love wearing a bikini.

11:49.754 --> 11:52.865
When I put one on, I
jiggle just like jelly.

11:54.237 --> 11:57.642
Well, she jiggles just like two
perfectly filled water balloons,

11:58.605 --> 12:01.811
but I'm afraid you'll never
get to see them or touch them

12:01.855 --> 12:04.532
or make a motorboat sound with
your mouth between them,

12:04.568 --> 12:06.329
because she is a lady!

12:09.567 --> 12:11.962
Sarah, you knew that
I would never do this.

12:12.150 --> 12:13.994
You were just trying
to make me look bad.

12:14.029 --> 12:15.884
And it's working.

12:17.152 --> 12:18.082
You're fired.

12:19.972 --> 12:22.532
Wait, you're firing
me because I won't strip?

12:22.673 --> 12:23.859
No, no, you know what?

12:24.000 --> 12:27.088
I'm a gentleman, and I normally
don't use this kind of language.

12:27.449 --> 12:31.371
But, Mr. Randall, you are
one sixing, sevening monkey-fiver.

12:32.650 --> 12:36.607
You think your one don't stink?
Well, three off, you threeing three!

12:44.951 --> 12:46.195
Ladies, ladies,

12:46.736 --> 12:50.047
I realize Tom Jones is late, and
I have an announcement to make.

12:50.439 --> 12:51.414
Shut up!

12:59.502 --> 13:01.013
Holy crap!

13:02.143 --> 13:04.316
It's like a water Buffalo Convention.

13:05.772 --> 13:09.118
I'm not waiting two hours for
a lousy autograph. Excuse me,

13:09.189 --> 13:12.500
excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry,
watch your feet. Excuse me,

13:12.699 --> 13:14.519
excuse me. Excuse me there, buddy.

13:16.774 --> 13:18.500
Hey, no cutsies.

13:18.605 --> 13:20.715
Oh, hell, I don't need Tom Jones.

13:20.821 --> 13:23.467
I'll sign the damn
album myself. Excuse me.

13:26.211 --> 13:27.901
Who pinched my behind?

13:30.074 --> 13:30.849
Bonnie!

13:31.412 --> 13:34.019
Your husband hasn't
even been dead two months!

13:38.539 --> 13:40.216
I am freakin' pissed.

13:40.674 --> 13:44.924
Sarah puts on a bikini and
whammo, she gets me fired?

13:45.734 --> 13:49.846
That little bimbo set this whole
thing up, and I am freakin' pissed!

13:52.185 --> 13:55.727
See what happens when you try to
skate through life using your brain?

13:59.078 --> 14:02.930
For the millionth time, people,
it's all about the looks!

14:04.362 --> 14:05.067
Well,

14:05.419 --> 14:08.296
I refuse to trade on my good
looks to achieve success.

14:09.975 --> 14:11.947
Eric Forman
don't play that game.

14:13.133 --> 14:15.575
Well, I'm not gonna let
her get away with this.

14:15.610 --> 14:17.395
I need to think of
a way to get even.

14:18.135 --> 14:20.542
All right, you need to
do something brilliant

14:20.882 --> 14:23.233
that's subtle
but clever.

14:24.630 --> 14:26.720
Hit her in the face with
a wiffle ball bat.

14:29.433 --> 14:29.996
Um,

14:30.747 --> 14:33.589
I don't think that's
exactly what I'm looking for.

14:34.199 --> 14:37.603
Okay, then, well, you've obviously never
been hit in the face with a wiffle ball bat.

14:38.977 --> 14:39.998
Wait a second.

14:40.033 --> 14:43.063
Sarah's gonna be broadcasting live
from the record store, right?

14:43.110 --> 14:43.779
Yeah.

14:44.331 --> 14:45.990
Okay, then I got
an awesome idea.

14:46.072 --> 14:49.782
Well, if it's hitting her in the face with
a wiffle ball bat, you stole that from me.

14:52.483 --> 14:56.815
Here it is, Kitty... a
signed Tom Jones album.

14:57.340 --> 14:58.380
Oh,

14:59.104 --> 15:00.995
Oh, thank you!

15:01.476 --> 15:04.917
Oh, I hope he wasn't upset I
couldn't be there myself.

15:06.971 --> 15:08.918
Did you tell him
I had the flu?

15:10.221 --> 15:11.372
Didn't come up.

15:12.429 --> 15:14.049
Well, what did you
talk about?

15:15.317 --> 15:16.033
Fishing.

15:17.559 --> 15:19.696
Tom Jones fishes?

15:20.095 --> 15:22.749
Yeah, it's surprising, I know.

15:24.358 --> 15:26.471
I'm so surprised

15:26.952 --> 15:29.181
that I'm gonna go
upstairs and take a nap.

15:39.300 --> 15:42.505
This is Sizzling Sarah at
grooves record store,

15:42.541 --> 15:44.900
coming at you live
without a bra.

15:45.558 --> 15:47.953
And up next,
some music from...

15:48.000 --> 15:49.033
a band.

15:51.970 --> 15:53.167
- That's great.
- Okay!

15:53.203 --> 15:55.692
I was thinking now would be a
good time to put a bikini on.

15:55.727 --> 15:58.017
Fortunately, I keep a
box of 'em in my car.

16:00.591 --> 16:03.280
Tom is two hours late.

16:03.315 --> 16:05.241
These women are gonna rip
this place apart.

16:05.276 --> 16:07.319
We've gotta think of
some way to distract them.

16:07.953 --> 16:09.973
What do you want me to
do, throw a ham at them?

16:10.555 --> 16:12.105
All right, all right,

16:13.244 --> 16:14.641
you should throw me at'em.

16:16.367 --> 16:19.232
I'll give these ladies
what they're not getting at home.

16:24.353 --> 16:24.952
Okay,

16:25.222 --> 16:26.361
there's Hyde.

16:26.795 --> 16:28.509
Go and tell him
you want him back.

16:29.199 --> 16:30.047
I can't.

16:30.362 --> 16:33.638
I mean, if I knew he loved me, I'd
be happy to put myself out there.

16:33.673 --> 16:36.984
But I don't, and if he doesn't,
I'll just feel so stupid.

16:37.618 --> 16:38.226
Okay,

16:38.895 --> 16:42.345
just go to him and say, "Steven,
I want to talk about us."

16:42.559 --> 16:44.637
And if he wants to talk,
then he wants you back.

16:44.672 --> 16:47.006
But if he blows you off,
then you tested the water,

16:47.041 --> 16:49.836
and the water, well, the
water doesn't love you.

16:52.677 --> 16:53.934
All right, here I go.

16:56.904 --> 16:59.370
Hey, um, Steven,
can we talk about us?

16:59.405 --> 17:01.516
Us? Who has time
to talk about us?

17:01.551 --> 17:04.546
Oh, lady, you're not at home!
Put your shoes back on!

17:08.902 --> 17:10.542
He didn't even want
to talk to me.

17:11.037 --> 17:12.962
Am I so disgusting?

17:13.373 --> 17:14.993
Apparently to him.

17:18.233 --> 17:20.298
Eric, are you sure
this is gonna work?

17:20.415 --> 17:22.905
Donna, let's just say when we're
done with Sizzling Sarah,

17:22.928 --> 17:26.579
her new nickname's gonna be "Crying,
No-job, Street Prostitute Sarah".

17:31.102 --> 17:32.041
Hi, Sarah.

17:32.687 --> 17:36.280
Hi, um, I just wanted to thank
you for getting me fired.

17:36.409 --> 17:39.811
I realize now that my feminist
ideals are just a bunch of hooey,

17:39.964 --> 17:42.935
and I should use my brains
less and my body more.

17:43.123 --> 17:46.892
Yeah, I don't know why women are
given brains in the first place.

17:47.397 --> 17:48.874
Anyway, um,

17:49.215 --> 17:52.127
Mr. Randall felt bad for me, so
he hired me back as an intern,

17:52.162 --> 17:54.287
and he wants you to play
this after the commercial,

17:54.980 --> 17:55.976
track six.

17:57.115 --> 17:58.477
You know, Donna,

17:58.641 --> 18:00.074
you and I are a lot alike,

18:00.273 --> 18:02.915
well, except I'm on the
radio, and you're not.

18:04.124 --> 18:04.859
Steven,

18:05.634 --> 18:08.546
Tom Jones is stuck in a
snowstorm. He's not coming.

18:08.851 --> 18:10.882
These women will riot!

18:11.857 --> 18:15.142
Yeah, when middle-aged women get
mad, they get super pissed.

18:16.493 --> 18:18.947
'Cause they got nothing to
lose. They're almost dead.

18:21.917 --> 18:25.761
Which is why we should have
somebody else break the news.

18:26.829 --> 18:28.708
Hey, Fez, you want
to meet some ladies?

18:30.305 --> 18:30.951
Yeah!

18:32.956 --> 18:36.150
Okay, I've just been
handed a hot new record,

18:36.185 --> 18:41.833
so here's George Carlin with "the seven dirty
words you can't say on television or radio."

18:42.558 --> 18:42.981
Huh,

18:43.638 --> 18:45.822
it seems like I almost shouldn't play it.

18:46.656 --> 18:47.560
Oh, well!

18:49.908 --> 18:52.997
Eric, thank you so much.
That was a great idea.

18:53.215 --> 18:54.060
You're welcome.

18:54.318 --> 18:55.739
Now let's go home and

18:56.080 --> 18:57.101
five all night.

19:05.136 --> 19:08.318
So, Steven, how was Tom Jones?

19:08.952 --> 19:09.962
Who knows? He
never even...

19:09.997 --> 19:11.876
...wanted to leave.

19:15.285 --> 19:16.095
Yeah,

19:16.424 --> 19:18.713
Tom loves his fans.

19:19.336 --> 19:25.298
I was just telling Kitty how I had to
chase down his limo to get her an autograph.

19:29.429 --> 19:30.462
Mrs. Forman,

19:30.638 --> 19:32.622
it was fantastic.

19:33.761 --> 19:37.014
You should have seen Red running after
Tom's limo, screaming like a little girl.

19:37.049 --> 19:39.090
- "Tom, Tom!"
- All right, all right!

19:44.984 --> 19:46.604
That's enough bragging.

19:47.673 --> 19:51.735
Well, and that is why I
am making this meatball hero

19:51.782 --> 19:55.176
for my meaty hero
of a husband.

19:56.315 --> 19:57.231
Hiya, Red.

19:57.877 --> 19:59.462
You were smart
not to stick around.

19:59.497 --> 20:02.730
I waited five hours. Tom
Jones never showed up.

20:07.098 --> 20:08.272
Never showed up?

20:10.350 --> 20:13.612
If Tom Jones never showed up,
who signed this autograph?

20:18.062 --> 20:19.394
I can't lie to you.

20:20.474 --> 20:22.095
It was Julio Iglesias.

20:27.848 --> 20:31.687
Those women at the record store flipped
when they heard the seven dirty words,

20:31.781 --> 20:35.645
especially word number four.
They do not like word number four.

20:37.547 --> 20:40.140
It was awesome, man.
Sarah got fired.

20:40.163 --> 20:43.592
The station manager got in trouble, and
Donna got her job back. I'm telling you,

20:43.627 --> 20:46.128
if I weren't unemployed
and living with my mommy,

20:49.992 --> 20:51.577
I'd be wickedly cool.

20:53.041 --> 20:55.596
Well, if you'd have hit somebody
in the face with a wiffle ball bat,

20:55.649 --> 20:57.464
this would have been
over hours ago.

20:58.810 --> 21:02.290
Okay, not only did I get my
job back, but I had conditions.

21:02.337 --> 21:05.765
I told Mr. Randall I'd be fully
clothed at all times, and he said okay.

21:05.800 --> 21:08.384
I told him to stop demeaning
women, and he said okay.

21:08.419 --> 21:13.246
And I told him to respect me for my mind and
my ideas and not my looks, and he said okay.

21:14.044 --> 21:17.050
So do you want people to
stop calling you "Hot Donna"?

21:17.074 --> 21:19.480
No, that makes me
feel pretty.

21:26.453 --> 21:29.598
Donna, you whore!
You got me fired!

21:30.914 --> 21:33.285
Wait, you're the one
who got me fired first.

21:33.332 --> 21:34.225
Well,

21:34.495 --> 21:36.321
I am so mad,

21:36.344 --> 21:38.845
I'm gonna make out with Fez!

21:41.241 --> 21:44.106
Well, if you're gonna make
out with Fez, then so am I!

21:50.079 --> 21:51.981
No, sleep, damn you, sleep!
