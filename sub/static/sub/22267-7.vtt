00:03.933 --> 00:05.087
Previously on Crazy
Ex-Girlfriend...

00:05.088 --> 00:08.841
REBECCA: Oh, I'm so embarrassed
that I caused such a scene.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.926
And I didn't, I didn't
even want to die.

00:10.927 --> 00:14.013
I just wanted the pain to stop.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.851
You don't want to
have a baby, do you?

00:18.852 --> 00:19.852
No.

00:19.853 --> 00:20.853
What are we gonna do?

00:20.854 --> 00:21.854
I don't know.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.856
Are you sure you don't
need to go be at home?

00:23.857 --> 00:25.274
What about your kids?

00:25.275 --> 00:27.735
PAULA: I am where I should be.

00:27.736 --> 00:28.736
Which is...

00:28.737 --> 00:29.987
right by your side.

00:29.988 --> 00:32.613
DR. SHIN: It is my opinion
that you exhibit many of the

00:32.615 --> 00:37.578
characteristics of borderline
personality disorder.

00:37.579 --> 00:39.288
I'm here for you.

00:39.289 --> 00:40.289
That really means a lot.

00:40.290 --> 00:46.462
(sighs happily) Hey, Heather.

00:46.463 --> 00:51.049
(door closes) What up,
what up, what up, what up?

00:51.050 --> 00:53.886
You're in a good mood.

00:53.887 --> 00:54.887
Yeah.

00:54.888 --> 00:55.888
Wow.

00:55.889 --> 00:56.889
Someone did some shopping.

00:56.890 --> 00:59.308
Yes, I'm very excited.

00:59.309 --> 01:01.477
Can't believe your doctor
gave you so much homework.

01:01.478 --> 01:03.687
Oh, no, you know, he only
assigned me one of those books,

01:03.688 --> 01:05.689
but I just figured, if
filling out one book is good,

01:05.690 --> 01:07.691
filling out all of them
must be even better.

01:07.692 --> 01:09.276
You're such an A student.

01:09.277 --> 01:10.861
God, I miss being a student.

01:10.862 --> 01:13.280
Is there something you can
fill out when you used to be a

01:13.281 --> 01:15.866
student, but now
you're not a student?

01:15.867 --> 01:17.868
I think it's called
a job application.

01:17.869 --> 01:18.869
Oh.

01:18.870 --> 01:19.828
Ah.

01:19.829 --> 01:20.871
Mm, okay.

01:20.872 --> 01:21.872
Okay.

01:21.873 --> 01:22.873
Okay.

01:22.874 --> 01:23.874
Okay.

01:23.875 --> 01:25.834
Oh-- let's see.

01:25.835 --> 01:29.171
"Exercise One: Scan your body
for any signs of distress."

01:29.172 --> 01:31.340
(robot voice):
Initiating body scan.

01:31.341 --> 01:32.758
Oh, these pants feel tight.

01:32.759 --> 01:33.759
They are tight in the crotch.

01:33.760 --> 01:34.802
These are terrible pants.

01:34.803 --> 01:36.804
I should get rid of these pants.

01:36.805 --> 01:38.806
Please don't take your
pants off in front of me,

01:38.807 --> 01:40.808
I know you haven't
done laundry lately.

01:40.809 --> 01:42.810
I'm actually wearing
your bikini bottoms.

01:42.811 --> 01:44.436
You can keep 'em.

01:44.437 --> 01:45.437
Thank you.

01:45.438 --> 01:51.693
(Rebecca scat singing)
Did all the books.

01:51.694 --> 01:54.029
Are you proud of me?

01:54.030 --> 01:56.031
I don't know if you keep
stickers around, but if you do,

01:56.032 --> 01:57.282
I prefer scratch-n-sniff, so...

01:57.283 --> 01:59.409
Rebecca, I applaud
your work ethic,

01:59.410 --> 02:02.120
but recovery is not about
assigning yourself homework and

02:02.121 --> 02:03.372
doing it in record time.

02:03.373 --> 02:05.374
So you're saying I set a record.

02:05.375 --> 02:09.544
I know you want an A-plus, but
I need to challenge you to get a

02:09.545 --> 02:11.045
different type of grade.

02:11.047 --> 02:12.548
What's better than an A-plus?

02:12.549 --> 02:13.549
A C-plus.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.551
(gasps) I know by
doing this work,

02:15.552 --> 02:18.095
you want to get better quickly,
but for someone like you,

02:18.096 --> 02:20.097
the overachieving is
part of the issue.

02:20.098 --> 02:21.557
You need to relax.

02:21.558 --> 02:22.558
Relax?

02:22.559 --> 02:24.561
Okay, is that what they
told you to do at Syracuse?

02:27.272 --> 02:30.732
I'm sor-- I'm sorry, Syracuse
is a lovely school for

02:30.733 --> 02:32.234
communications or something.

02:32.235 --> 02:34.236
Hey, you need to
put the pencil down.

02:34.237 --> 02:36.238
You have been in
a therapy bubble.

02:36.239 --> 02:37.239
All right?

02:37.240 --> 02:39.241
It is time to take steps
into the real world.

02:39.242 --> 02:40.242
The real world?

02:40.243 --> 02:42.244
No, no, I don't want that,
'cause what if I mess things up?

02:42.245 --> 02:43.328
Then that's okay.

02:43.329 --> 02:45.956
Go out there and make some
messes, have some adventures.

02:45.957 --> 02:47.958
And stop being so
hard on yourself.

02:47.959 --> 02:49.251
I mean, you're right.

02:49.252 --> 02:50.252
I am hard on myself.

02:50.253 --> 02:52.254
God, it's one of
my worst qualities.

02:52.255 --> 02:54.256
God, I'm such a dumb,
loser, hard-on-myself bitch.

02:54.257 --> 02:56.216
That.

02:56.217 --> 02:57.509
Stop doing that.

02:57.510 --> 03:02.097
(sighs) I just
don't want to fail.

03:02.098 --> 03:04.349
You need to redefine failure.

03:04.350 --> 03:06.977
As I did, when I only got
into my safety school.

03:06.978 --> 03:08.937
(laughs): Oh, ho...

03:08.938 --> 03:11.356
That's a beauty.

03:11.357 --> 03:14.484
(giggles) Hey!

03:14.485 --> 03:20.073
Look, I made special
pancakes with a sports theme.

03:20.074 --> 03:23.118
Basketball, soccer ball,
baseball, golf ball.

03:23.119 --> 03:24.202
Those are just circles, Mom.

03:24.203 --> 03:26.455
Oh, wait till you hear
what happened this morning.

03:26.456 --> 03:29.708
Okay, so Grandma calls and
she said she's got this church

03:29.709 --> 03:31.793
retreat in Minnesota
that she has to go to,

03:31.794 --> 03:34.755
and she wants me to
stay with Grampa.

03:34.756 --> 03:38.342
(laughs) 'Cause he fell down
'cause he's old or-- cough,

03:38.343 --> 03:39.551
cough-- alcoholic.

03:39.552 --> 03:40.969
What is she thinking?

03:40.970 --> 03:42.971
Like I would ever
go and do that.

03:42.972 --> 03:44.973
You guys know how
much my dad annoys me.

03:44.974 --> 03:46.975
Who's ready for an
egg-n-cheese sammy?

03:46.976 --> 03:47.976
I am.

03:47.977 --> 03:48.977
Me, too.

03:48.978 --> 03:49.978
SCOTT: (chuckles) So hungry.

03:49.979 --> 03:50.979
You're going out to breakfast?

03:50.980 --> 03:52.981
I mean, what are
you talking about?

03:52.982 --> 03:54.983
While you were busy with
Rebecca, we got a new routine.

03:54.984 --> 03:56.985
We do drive-through
for breakfast now.

03:56.986 --> 03:57.986
BRENDAN: Yeah.

03:57.987 --> 03:58.987
Let's get going.

03:58.988 --> 03:59.988
Starving.

03:59.989 --> 04:00.989
Mmm.

04:00.990 --> 04:01.990
Yeah, same.

04:01.991 --> 04:02.991
(chuckles): Mm-hmm.

04:02.992 --> 04:03.992
So hungry.

04:03.993 --> 04:04.993
Craving those sandwiches.

04:04.994 --> 04:05.994
Hey, Scott.

04:05.995 --> 04:06.995
TOMMY: Yeah, it's the best.

04:06.996 --> 04:08.997
Look, I know I was AWOL
with Rebecca, but I'm back.

04:08.998 --> 04:09.998
I'm here.

04:09.999 --> 04:12.000
I am doing laundry, I
am flushing toilets,

04:12.001 --> 04:13.001
I am helping with homework.

04:13.002 --> 04:15.003
Okay, let's face it,
I am doing homework.

04:15.004 --> 04:17.005
Yeah, but we don't know how
long this is gonna last.

04:17.005 --> 04:18.005
You go through phases.

04:18.007 --> 04:20.050
Before Rebecca, there
were those vampire novels.

04:20.051 --> 04:26.640
Sudoku, and then there was the
obsession with Amal Clooney's

04:26.641 --> 04:27.641
outfits.

04:27.642 --> 04:29.643
She is a style icon
and a barrister.

04:29.644 --> 04:31.645
There's always something you're
obsessed with and, uh, eh,

04:31.646 --> 04:32.646
it's kind of never us.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.648
We're like a, I don't
know, a chore or something.

04:34.649 --> 04:35.649
You're not a chore.

04:35.650 --> 04:38.318
This is my life and
I have accepted it.

04:38.319 --> 04:44.157
My life is chores and working
and studying and never having

04:44.158 --> 04:48.078
enough time to finish the last
season of Outlander, it's fine.

04:48.079 --> 04:50.038
I wasn't trying to
start something.

04:50.039 --> 04:51.373
You do your best.

04:51.374 --> 04:54.334
But it always feels like there's
some part of you that's not

04:54.335 --> 04:55.627
really here.

04:55.628 --> 04:56.628
Why is that?

04:56.629 --> 04:58.213
Hmm.

04:58.214 --> 05:02.634
Don't know.

05:02.635 --> 05:05.387
I'm in just such a transitional
time right now, you know?

05:05.388 --> 05:06.680
Tell me about it.

05:06.681 --> 05:10.350
My voice is cracking, hair
is appearing in very strange

05:10.351 --> 05:13.645
places, and my armpits are
starting to smell like...

05:13.646 --> 05:15.981
like armpits.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.150
But I'm supposed
to be past that.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.151
I'm a big boy.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.152
What's the word for that?

05:20.153 --> 05:21.153
Man.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.154
Yeah.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.155
Man, what is the word for that?

05:23.156 --> 05:25.157
Josh, I couldn't help but
overhear as I was trying to

05:25.158 --> 05:26.158
overhear.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.952
You're looking for a job, huh?

05:28.953 --> 05:34.166
(scoffs) I really need a job.

05:34.167 --> 05:37.210
I'm on indefinite suspension
from Aloha so I'm broke.

05:37.211 --> 05:39.212
We've been looking
for a bartender.

05:39.213 --> 05:40.213
You interested?

05:40.214 --> 05:41.465
Bartending?

05:41.466 --> 05:42.466
Huh.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.468
I thought it was kind of
lame when Greg did it,

05:44.469 --> 05:45.927
but I bet I could make it cool.

05:45.928 --> 05:49.473
I am really coordinated because
of my martial arts and my magic.

05:49.474 --> 05:52.601
I bet I could pick up some dope
Cocktail tricks pretty fast.

05:52.602 --> 05:55.228
We mostly serve beer, so we
don't need anything fancy.

05:55.229 --> 06:00.193
Thanks for not cheering
too loud at my game today.

06:03.529 --> 06:04.571
I know it was hard.

06:04.572 --> 06:08.617
Yeah, I tried to reign it in,
but it is hard because Madison

06:08.618 --> 06:10.285
is rad-ison.

06:10.286 --> 06:12.287
(chuckles) I'll excuse it
because you're going through a

06:12.288 --> 06:13.288
tough time.

06:13.289 --> 06:16.793
I mean, you just broke
up with your boyfriend.

06:19.921 --> 06:21.922
You did break up
with him, right?

06:21.923 --> 06:22.923
(clears throat) What?

06:22.924 --> 06:23.924
Come on!

06:23.925 --> 06:25.175
You want to have a baby.

06:25.176 --> 06:26.510
He doesn't.

06:26.511 --> 06:27.636
I know, but it's so hard.

06:27.637 --> 06:28.970
I still care about him.

06:28.971 --> 06:29.971
I love him.

06:29.972 --> 06:31.973
You got to rip off the Band-Aid.

06:31.974 --> 06:33.975
That's how I broke
up with Jimmy.

06:33.976 --> 06:37.896
I ripped off his Band-Aid.

06:37.897 --> 06:38.897
Here he is.

06:38.898 --> 06:39.898
Do it.

06:39.899 --> 06:40.899
Joshua!

06:40.900 --> 06:42.901
My dad has something
to tell you.

06:42.902 --> 06:44.444
Oh, yeah?

06:44.445 --> 06:45.445
Um...

06:45.446 --> 06:46.780
What's up?

06:46.781 --> 06:48.949
(sighs) Um...

06:48.950 --> 06:49.950
Madison won her game.

06:49.951 --> 06:54.579
WHITE JOSH: Oh, nice, Madison.

06:54.580 --> 06:57.415
Way to go.

06:57.416 --> 06:59.417
So, you're really thinking
about going back to Buffalo?

06:59.418 --> 07:01.419
Nobody appreciates me
at my house right now.

07:01.420 --> 07:02.754
I mean, I might as well.

07:02.755 --> 07:05.298
Scott has been so pissy lately.

07:05.299 --> 07:08.468
Oh, sometimes I wish I could
just touch a stone wall and go

07:08.469 --> 07:11.721
back to 1743 to be with my other
husband, the Scottish warrior,

07:11.722 --> 07:13.974
and you don't watch
Outlander, do you?

07:13.975 --> 07:14.975
Mm, sorry.

07:14.976 --> 07:16.977
Like, none of this
makes any sense to you.

07:16.978 --> 07:18.395
(inhales sharply) Okay.

07:18.396 --> 07:20.397
Anyway, Paula, are you sure you
want to go back and hang out

07:20.398 --> 07:21.398
with your dad?

07:21.399 --> 07:23.358
I mean, you hate him; he
makes you feel horrible about

07:23.359 --> 07:24.359
yourself.

07:24.360 --> 07:29.156
Yeah, no, I wasn't gonna go,
but, you know, he needs me and,

07:29.157 --> 07:32.159
I mean, Buffalo's
gonna be messy, but...

07:32.160 --> 07:35.328
at least it's kind
of an adventure.

07:35.329 --> 07:36.621
A messy adventure, you say?

07:36.622 --> 07:37.873
That sounds fun.

07:37.874 --> 07:39.875
You know, I've always
wanted to go to Buffalo.

07:39.876 --> 07:40.876
You have?

07:40.877 --> 07:41.877
Yes, yes.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.879
Ever since I saw Bruce Almighty.

07:43.880 --> 07:44.880
(laughs): Oh, my...

07:44.881 --> 07:45.881
Paula.

07:45.882 --> 07:46.882
Paula, no, this is perfect.

07:46.883 --> 07:48.884
This is exactly the kind of
adventure that Dr. Shin was

07:48.885 --> 07:49.885
talking about.

07:49.886 --> 07:51.511
Let me come with you.

07:51.512 --> 07:52.512
Really?

07:52.513 --> 07:53.513
Yeah.

07:53.514 --> 07:57.976
(knocking on door)
Yeah, come in, Paula.

07:57.977 --> 07:58.977
Hey.

07:58.978 --> 07:59.978
Oh.

07:59.979 --> 08:05.859
I just, uh, wanted
to come check on you.

08:05.860 --> 08:09.654
You know, like men do.

08:09.655 --> 08:10.655
Haven't seen you in a while.

08:10.656 --> 08:11.656
Everything good?

08:11.657 --> 08:13.658
You're not running
away again, are you?

08:13.659 --> 08:16.369
No, no, no, I'm just, I'm going
on a quick trip with Paula.

08:16.370 --> 08:18.622
I'm trying to get out of my
bubble, my therapy bubble.

08:18.623 --> 08:21.333
It's why I've been kind of MIA
from everything, so, sorry.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.375
Oh, no, don't be sorry.

08:22.376 --> 08:23.627
It's, it's good to see you.

08:23.628 --> 08:24.961
Yeah.

08:24.962 --> 08:26.963
Might have missed
you a little bit.

08:26.964 --> 08:27.964
I don't know.

08:27.965 --> 08:28.965
Prob-Probably not.

08:28.966 --> 08:30.967
I'm probably just feeling
a little weird because I

08:30.968 --> 08:32.969
accidentally had
dairy yesterday.

08:32.970 --> 08:35.179
I asked for a grilled cheese
sandwich, but I said "no cheese,

08:35.181 --> 08:37.765
no bread, I just want a hot,
salty tomato." But, you know,

08:37.767 --> 08:39.308
they don't listen.

08:39.309 --> 08:40.309
Cool.

08:40.311 --> 08:42.312
What a roundabout explanation
for wanting to come see a

08:42.313 --> 08:43.313
friend.

08:43.313 --> 08:48.319
Come here.

08:55.952 --> 08:57.327
I don't know if I can have sex.

08:57.328 --> 08:58.328
Huh?

08:58.329 --> 09:01.206
I don't know if the books
say that I can have sex yet.

09:01.207 --> 09:05.710
I mean, and I definitely am
not ready for a relationship.

09:05.711 --> 09:07.879
Not that that's what
you're trying to do.

09:07.880 --> 09:08.880
I don't know what I'm saying.

09:08.881 --> 09:09.881
You're a really good hugger.

09:09.882 --> 09:10.882
Oh, thank you.

09:10.883 --> 09:12.884
The thing is, I would love
to have sex with you again.

09:12.885 --> 09:14.886
Like, I'm talking to
you here right now,

09:14.887 --> 09:16.888
but there's another
version of me-- like,

09:16.889 --> 09:18.890
an alternate version in a
parallel universe-- that's just

09:18.891 --> 09:20.892
ripping your clothes off right
now and climbing you like the

09:20.893 --> 09:22.894
sequoia you are, you
know what I'm sayin'?

09:22.895 --> 09:23.895
Sequoia?

09:23.896 --> 09:24.896
Yeah.

09:24.897 --> 09:26.898
'Cause you're, like, tall and
hard, and wooden, and sexy,

09:26.899 --> 09:28.900
and native to California, so
just get out of here, please.

09:28.901 --> 09:29.901
Please just get out of here.

09:29.902 --> 09:30.902
Okay.

09:30.903 --> 09:31.903
All right.

09:31.904 --> 09:34.322
I'm-a go.

09:34.323 --> 09:35.573
Go.

09:35.574 --> 09:36.783
But...

09:36.784 --> 09:40.662
I'm-a go sexy.

09:40.663 --> 09:45.917
(yelps) (laughing) Why is
Nathaniel leaving so sexy?

09:45.918 --> 09:46.918
It's a whole thing.

09:46.919 --> 09:47.919
Let's just go.

09:47.920 --> 09:48.878
Okay.

09:48.879 --> 09:49.879
No.

09:49.880 --> 09:55.885
Mm, no.

09:55.886 --> 09:56.886
Hey, Dad.

09:56.887 --> 09:58.263
Look who's home from Hollywood.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.764
(laughs) It's West Covina.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.766
It's not even
close to Hollywood.

10:01.767 --> 10:02.767
This is my friend, Rebecca.

10:02.768 --> 10:04.769
Look, enough with
the pleasantries.

10:04.770 --> 10:06.771
Your mother told you
come and babysit me.

10:06.772 --> 10:07.772
I don't need it.

10:07.773 --> 10:10.483
I fell, I got a giant
bruise on my ass cheek.

10:10.484 --> 10:12.360
Other than that, I'm perfect.

10:12.361 --> 10:15.530
Hey, isn't that the girl
your mother told me about?

10:15.531 --> 10:18.575
She, uh, kind of sucks
at killing herself?

10:18.576 --> 10:19.576
Dad!

10:19.577 --> 10:23.580
(laughs) Hey, I know this
guy from my old precinct in

10:23.581 --> 10:26.624
Brooklyn, he tried to shoot
himself in his foot to get

10:26.625 --> 10:27.667
workers' comp.

10:27.668 --> 10:29.294
Blew off his willie.

10:29.295 --> 10:30.545
You're like that guy.

10:30.546 --> 10:32.547
Oh, my God, Rebecca,
I am so sorry.

10:32.548 --> 10:33.548
No, no, no.

10:33.549 --> 10:34.549
It-It's okay.

10:34.550 --> 10:36.551
Wait, wait, so the guy
just blew off the willie?

10:36.552 --> 10:37.635
Not the entire package?

10:37.636 --> 10:39.888
So that means he just missed
out on becoming, like,

10:39.889 --> 10:40.889
a great soprano?

10:40.890 --> 10:41.890
By a hair.

10:41.891 --> 10:45.935
(Rebecca and Bob
laughing) He's funny.

10:45.936 --> 10:47.395
He's really not.

10:47.396 --> 10:49.397
Paula doesn't have
a sense of humor.

10:49.398 --> 10:50.398
Never has.

10:50.399 --> 10:52.859
That's why she's not likable.

10:52.860 --> 10:55.612
Hey, I'm not saying
anything you don't know.

10:55.613 --> 10:57.238
You have other qualities.

10:57.239 --> 10:58.239
You're sturdy.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.241
Would've made a great
defensive tackle.

11:00.242 --> 11:01.409
Well, see, Paula?

11:01.410 --> 11:03.411
That's-that's a
genderless compliment.

11:03.412 --> 11:05.997
Yeah, you know, I always
actually wondered if maybe Paula

11:05.998 --> 11:08.124
had a pecker, a little one,
you know what I'm saying?

11:08.125 --> 11:09.167
Okay, never mind.

11:09.168 --> 11:10.168
I'm sorry.

11:10.169 --> 11:12.462
You know what?

11:12.463 --> 11:13.963
I'm gonna go to the market.

11:13.964 --> 11:15.965
'Cause I'll bet all you got
in the fridge is artillery and

11:15.966 --> 11:16.966
vodka.

11:16.967 --> 11:19.094
Oh, I'm almost out of vodka.

11:19.095 --> 11:20.095
Go ahead.

11:20.096 --> 11:21.096
I'll stay with him.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.097
Bye.

11:22.098 --> 11:27.811
(door opens, closes) Hey, would
you like to see a big turd I

11:27.812 --> 11:28.812
left in the toilet?

11:28.813 --> 11:29.813
No.

11:29.814 --> 11:30.814
Kinda.

11:30.815 --> 11:31.815
(sighs) PAULA (echoing): Jeff.

11:31.816 --> 11:36.821
Can I help you, ma'am?

11:38.000 --> 11:44.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

11:48.874 --> 11:53.128
Who is that?

11:53.129 --> 11:54.546
That's...

11:54.547 --> 11:59.050
That's my Josh Chan.

11:59.051 --> 12:04.056
Is that your ex or something?

12:07.977 --> 12:10.562
Oh, he's not just any ex.

12:10.563 --> 12:11.563
He's...

12:11.564 --> 12:13.231
he's the one I never got over.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.817
I thought if I saw
him again, I'd...

12:15.818 --> 12:17.819
I'd want to punch
him in the face,

12:17.820 --> 12:20.989
but instead I feel all
warm and tingly inside,

12:20.990 --> 12:22.991
like glitter is
exploding inside of me.

12:22.992 --> 12:24.993
CLERK: So he was
your first love?

12:24.994 --> 12:28.705
Oh, baby, he was my
first everything.

12:28.706 --> 12:34.794
I've thought about him for so
long Those memories are crystal

12:34.795 --> 12:39.800
clear I was so young He was so
big and strong I can't believe

12:42.511 --> 12:47.516
that he's right here I was such
an innocent girl When we first

12:49.727 --> 12:54.690
met He opened up my eyes, showed
me a whole new world So how

12:57.443 --> 12:59.652
could I ever forget?

12:59.653 --> 13:03.531
The first penis
I saw Firs penis,

13:03.532 --> 13:09.579
very first penis First penis
Very first penis I saw First

13:09.580 --> 13:15.668
penis, very first penis, penis
First penis Very first penis I

13:15.669 --> 13:20.674
saw And of all the penises I've
seen His had the biggest impact

13:22.843 --> 13:29.641
And by that what I mean is
It really made me drop my jaw

13:29.642 --> 13:34.647
'Cause it was the very first
penis I saw A few times before I

13:44.448 --> 13:46.658
felt it through his pants
just generally kinda rubbed it

13:46.659 --> 13:51.996
But that night I decided to take
a chance I took it out and he

13:51.997 --> 13:56.876
really seemed to love it
didn't know what to do next I

13:56.877 --> 13:59.170
didn't have that
part planned said,

13:59.171 --> 14:04.133
"Let me show you some basic
moves" And then he took my hand

14:04.134 --> 14:07.220
And taught me all
about the First penis,

14:07.221 --> 14:11.432
very first penis First penis
Very first penis I saw First

14:11.433 --> 14:16.271
penis, very first penis, penis
First penis Very first penis I

14:16.272 --> 14:21.277
saw Not the dirtiest, also not
the cleanest In terms of penis,

14:25.990 --> 14:30.995
I really was the greenest I was
in total awe Of the very first

14:38.961 --> 14:43.590
penis I saw He's coming!

14:43.591 --> 14:47.260
Bail on the turntable!

14:47.261 --> 14:52.266
I was so eager, I couldn't hide
my keenness Everything about it

14:58.397 --> 15:03.402
seemed quite ingenious
couldn't find a single flaw In

15:06.697 --> 15:11.702
the first penis Very first
penis Very first penis I saw!

15:16.874 --> 15:18.750
Paula O'Brien?

15:18.751 --> 15:21.210
Jeff Channington.

15:21.211 --> 15:23.212
Heather, you're gonna
have to step it up.

15:23.213 --> 15:25.214
I've been rocking the
YouTube tutorials,

15:25.215 --> 15:27.800
and a simple pour ain't
gonna win you this rodeo.

15:27.801 --> 15:29.093
I'm not in a rodeo.

15:29.094 --> 15:30.637
Hey, check this out.

15:30.638 --> 15:33.139
I call this the Big Boy.

15:33.140 --> 15:34.140
Who's thirsty?

15:34.141 --> 15:35.141
Who's thirsty?

15:35.142 --> 15:36.517
I'm a Big Boy!

15:36.518 --> 15:38.019
I'm a Big Boy!

15:38.020 --> 15:40.647
Oh, man, this is a barf.

15:40.648 --> 15:44.400
You like that?

15:44.401 --> 15:45.693
Yeah.

15:45.694 --> 15:49.447
(laughing) All right!

15:49.448 --> 15:51.449
Hey, I'm Teresa.

15:51.450 --> 15:52.450
I'm Josh.

15:52.451 --> 15:54.619
I'm a big boy.

15:54.620 --> 15:55.620
I can see that.

15:55.621 --> 15:58.247
(chuckles) I love
your Cocktail moves.

15:58.248 --> 15:59.248
Thanks.

15:59.249 --> 16:00.249
It's called flair.

16:00.250 --> 16:01.918
Cool.

16:01.919 --> 16:05.380
Hey, so you busy after
work tomorrow night?

16:05.381 --> 16:07.507
Oh, I always get busy
after work tomorrow night.

16:07.508 --> 16:11.594
(laughs) That's good!

16:11.595 --> 16:15.682
(laughs) I mean...

16:15.683 --> 16:19.769
this is unbelievable.

16:19.770 --> 16:22.647
So you...

16:22.648 --> 16:23.648
back in town?

16:23.649 --> 16:25.650
I mean, I thought you were
off living in Hollywood.

16:25.651 --> 16:26.818
Well, actually, uh, yes.

16:26.819 --> 16:27.819
Yes.

16:27.820 --> 16:28.820
Yes, I am.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.822
Yes, I'm back for a
couple of days, yes.

16:30.823 --> 16:31.823
Wow.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.825
I mean, you're just here for a
couple of days and we ran into

16:33.826 --> 16:34.826
each other?

16:34.827 --> 16:35.827
That is crazy.

16:35.828 --> 16:36.828
Yeah.

16:36.829 --> 16:37.829
So weird, right?

16:37.830 --> 16:39.789
I mean, we haven't seen
each other since...

16:39.790 --> 16:43.084
You dumped me in the parking lot
of the mall after we saw Fried

16:43.085 --> 16:44.085
Green Tomatoes.

16:44.086 --> 16:46.087
(sighs) I'm sorry.

16:46.088 --> 16:47.547
What a jerk I was.

16:47.548 --> 16:50.174
Yeah, so ever since then, I
hear Kathy Bates do a Southern

16:50.175 --> 16:52.176
accent, and I have
to leave the room.

16:52.177 --> 16:55.763
You know, Paula, you were so
cool and so funny and so smart.

16:55.764 --> 16:57.807
And you were the only girl in
town who knew anything about

16:57.808 --> 16:59.767
Camaros.

16:59.768 --> 17:00.935
By the way, I'm restoring one.

17:00.936 --> 17:02.520
Yeah, I bought it on eBay.

17:02.521 --> 17:05.690
It's stupid, but it's my hobby.

17:05.691 --> 17:08.443
Always makes me think of you.

17:08.444 --> 17:09.484
Me?

17:09.486 --> 17:11.488
Yeah.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.031
Do you want to come and see it?

17:14.031 --> 17:18.661
(sighs, groans)
Look, here's my card.

17:18.662 --> 17:23.666
In case you change your mind.

17:36.263 --> 17:38.890
I've never watched
conservative news before.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.309
All the women look exactly
the same, like they're old,

17:41.310 --> 17:42.685
blonde Miss USAs.

17:42.686 --> 17:43.686
Why is that?

17:43.687 --> 17:46.606
Well, if we put 'em on the news,
then we don't have to send 'em

17:46.607 --> 17:48.608
out to the glue factory.

17:48.609 --> 17:50.651
(both laugh) Bob,
that's terrible.

17:50.652 --> 17:51.652
Eh...

17:51.653 --> 17:52.820
Bob, be real.

17:52.821 --> 17:55.490
You don't agree with
all this stuff, right?

17:55.491 --> 17:59.535
I mean, you don't think
everyone should own a gun?

17:59.536 --> 18:00.536
Oh, no.

18:00.537 --> 18:04.791
They should own two guns: one
for animals, one for people.

18:04.792 --> 18:05.792
Bob!

18:05.793 --> 18:06.793
(laughs) God.

18:06.794 --> 18:07.794
Of course.

18:07.795 --> 18:08.795
Here you go.

18:08.796 --> 18:09.796
Oh, ah...

18:09.797 --> 18:10.797
I don't know if I can.

18:10.798 --> 18:12.131
Sorry.

18:12.132 --> 18:14.133
I honestly don't know what
my book says about alcohol.

18:14.134 --> 18:15.134
Your book?

18:15.135 --> 18:16.135
You mean like a Bible?

18:16.136 --> 18:17.136
Uh, kinda, but less sci-fi.

18:17.137 --> 18:18.137
Um...

18:18.138 --> 18:19.138
Oh...

18:19.139 --> 18:22.475
Okay, but alcohol's
not really my trigger.

18:22.476 --> 18:24.519
"Trigger." Now you're
speaking my language.

18:24.520 --> 18:25.978
Let's get sauced.

18:25.979 --> 18:28.064
Let's do some shots.

18:28.065 --> 18:29.065
Come on.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.066
Okay.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.484
The news is great on shots.

18:31.485 --> 18:32.902
(laughs) All right.

18:32.903 --> 18:33.903
Here we go.

18:33.904 --> 18:34.904
All right, cheers.

18:34.905 --> 18:35.905
Mmm.

18:35.906 --> 18:36.906
Mmm.

18:36.907 --> 18:37.907
Whoo!

18:37.908 --> 18:39.909
Ooh, it burns like
a spicy salsa party!

18:39.910 --> 18:40.993
Yes, yes.

18:40.994 --> 18:43.412
(laughs): It feels so good.

18:43.413 --> 18:44.413
Hey.

18:44.414 --> 18:45.414
Hey!

18:45.415 --> 18:46.415
Hi!

18:46.416 --> 18:47.416
Oh.

18:47.417 --> 18:48.376
This looks like a fun time.

18:48.377 --> 18:49.377
Uh-huh, yeah.

18:49.378 --> 18:51.379
Hey, Rebecca, do you have a
second to come talk to me in the

18:51.380 --> 18:52.380
kitchen?

18:52.381 --> 18:53.381
Yeah, I'll be right there.

18:53.382 --> 18:55.383
I'm just busy getting a
C-plus in getting D-runk!

18:55.384 --> 18:59.387
(laughs): Yeah.

18:59.388 --> 19:01.389
(laughs) (sighs, laughs)
Oh, there you go.

19:01.390 --> 19:02.390
You're doing very well.

19:02.391 --> 19:03.391
She's doing very well.

19:03.392 --> 19:04.392
Oh, thank you.

19:04.393 --> 19:05.393
Very well.

19:05.394 --> 19:10.399
(Rebecca and Bob continue
chattering) (snorts) I'm gonna

19:24.454 --> 19:26.664
whiz and, uh, hit the hay.

19:26.665 --> 19:28.499
Okay.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.458
Good night, Bob.

19:29.459 --> 19:31.210
That was fun.

19:31.211 --> 19:32.253
Oh, is Paula back yet?

19:32.254 --> 19:33.880
I wonder if she's in bed.

19:33.881 --> 19:40.261
(phone chimes) Oh.

19:40.262 --> 19:45.516
(sighs) (chuckles) Sequoia.

19:45.517 --> 19:50.480
(chuckles) (laughs)
JEFF: You came!

20:16.340 --> 20:21.345
(chuckles softly) You're here.

20:29.770 --> 20:31.729
Well, I wanted to see the Z/28.

20:31.730 --> 20:36.735
And that is the only
reason I'm here.

20:47.204 --> 20:52.375
(chuckles) Well...

20:52.376 --> 20:54.710
I don't care why you're here.

20:54.711 --> 20:56.963
I'm just happy to see you.

20:56.964 --> 21:01.968
(chuckles) You're throwing
wrenches at me now?

21:01.969 --> 21:03.844
Hmm.

21:03.845 --> 21:05.721
Oh.

21:05.722 --> 21:07.598
Ooh.

21:07.599 --> 21:09.475
Ooh.

21:09.476 --> 21:15.106
(chuckles) Let's see.

21:15.107 --> 21:20.528
(Josh humming) Big
boy's back in the game.

21:20.529 --> 21:21.821
Who's got it?

21:21.822 --> 21:23.698
Got it...

21:23.699 --> 21:26.492
Oh, my God.

21:26.493 --> 21:29.245
What is that?

21:29.246 --> 21:30.246
No...

21:30.247 --> 21:32.039
Not today.

21:32.040 --> 21:35.793
I have a date.

21:35.794 --> 21:36.794
Ow.

21:36.795 --> 21:37.753
Ow!

21:37.754 --> 21:44.135
(shouts) (coughs, snorts)
(moans) (moaning) (gasps) Good

21:44.136 --> 21:45.136
morning.

21:45.137 --> 21:46.929
(snorts) Mm.

21:46.930 --> 21:50.641
Did you sleep well?

21:50.642 --> 21:51.642
Yeah.

21:51.643 --> 21:52.810
Hi.

21:52.811 --> 21:54.186
Where were you last night?

21:54.187 --> 21:56.313
I got up to pee at some point,
and I went to check on you,

21:56.314 --> 21:58.941
and you weren't in your bed.

21:58.942 --> 22:01.110
I may have number one'd
in one of your drawers.

22:01.111 --> 22:02.111
No, I did.

22:02.112 --> 22:03.112
I definitely did.

22:03.113 --> 22:04.113
I'm sorry, I was drunk.

22:04.114 --> 22:05.114
I went out.

22:05.115 --> 22:06.115
I, uh...

22:06.116 --> 22:08.159
saw an old friend who was fixing
up an old Camaro downtown,

22:08.160 --> 22:10.828
and I happen to
love those, so...

22:10.829 --> 22:12.621
Oh, right, you love cars.

22:12.622 --> 22:14.623
I always forget that because
it doesn't interest me.

22:14.624 --> 22:16.625
(chuckles) Well, I'm
glad you did that.

22:16.626 --> 22:17.626
Good for you.

22:17.627 --> 22:19.628
You deserve to have a
little late-night party fun.

22:19.629 --> 22:21.589
You never do anything
for yourself.

22:21.590 --> 22:22.590
Well, you know.

22:22.591 --> 22:23.591
Sometimes I do.

22:23.592 --> 22:24.592
You really don't, though.

22:24.593 --> 22:28.345
You're always too busy being a
good wife and mom and friend and

22:28.346 --> 22:29.346
co-worker.

22:29.347 --> 22:31.348
You're like
everyone's big spoon.

22:31.349 --> 22:32.349
You're so reliable.

22:32.350 --> 22:35.352
(clicks tongue)
You look so pretty.

22:35.353 --> 22:36.353
Where you going?

22:36.354 --> 22:37.354
Oh, um...

22:37.355 --> 22:40.149
I'm going to see the friend.

22:40.150 --> 22:41.942
Who's your friend?

22:41.943 --> 22:43.152
My friend?

22:43.153 --> 22:44.153
Um...

22:44.154 --> 22:45.154
He-- she...

22:45.155 --> 22:46.739
She's a she.

22:46.740 --> 22:48.032
Sheila Girlface.

22:48.033 --> 22:49.158
"Sheila Girlface"?

22:49.159 --> 22:53.287
Yeah, well, it's
Girlfacce, but, you know,

22:53.288 --> 22:55.289
they had to change
it at Ellis Island.

22:55.290 --> 22:57.041
Assimilation is a rape.

22:57.042 --> 22:59.919
Anyway, uh, my friend invited me
to Saturday Mass this morning.

22:59.920 --> 23:01.337
You want to come?

23:01.338 --> 23:02.755
Uh...

23:02.756 --> 23:03.839
Oh, it sounds awesome.

23:03.840 --> 23:04.840
Um...

23:04.841 --> 23:06.842
but Bob and I got
to check his traps.

23:06.843 --> 23:09.470
For raccoons, and people's
stupid small dogs.

23:09.471 --> 23:11.472
Both make cool hats, apparently.

23:11.473 --> 23:13.724
Wow, you two really get along.

23:13.725 --> 23:14.725
I'm sorry.

23:14.726 --> 23:15.726
Is it annoying?

23:15.727 --> 23:16.727
Should I stop?

23:16.728 --> 23:17.728
I can stop.

23:17.729 --> 23:19.730
It's a little
annoying, but, listen,

23:19.731 --> 23:20.731
you're really doing me a favor.

23:20.732 --> 23:22.733
You're taking care of him, and
so I'm free to do what I want to

23:22.734 --> 23:23.776
do, which is go to church.

23:23.777 --> 23:24.777
Okay, bye.

23:24.778 --> 23:25.778
Okay.

23:25.779 --> 23:28.489
Tell God I say...

23:28.490 --> 23:31.118
well, he knows how I feel.

23:33.995 --> 23:35.412
Thank God.

23:35.413 --> 23:37.039
I was waiting for her to leave.

23:37.040 --> 23:40.126
Was so wasted last night, I
went in one of her drawers.

23:40.127 --> 23:41.502
So did I.

23:41.503 --> 23:42.795
I thought that was you!

23:42.796 --> 23:44.046
(both laughing) Hey.

23:44.047 --> 23:45.047
Hey!

23:45.048 --> 23:46.048
This is a nice surprise.

23:46.049 --> 23:47.049
I have baseball practice.

23:47.050 --> 23:49.009
What are you doing here?

23:49.010 --> 23:55.057
Well, Madison said to meet her.

23:55.058 --> 24:01.063
She wanted to
practice her slider.

24:01.064 --> 24:02.064
Ah.

24:02.065 --> 24:05.067
(women chattering) Ooh.

24:05.068 --> 24:07.111
Oh, look.

24:07.112 --> 24:11.365
She's like the sweetest...

24:11.366 --> 24:13.868
Sliders are not really a
thing in softball, are they?

24:13.869 --> 24:14.869
Uh...

24:14.870 --> 24:16.871
Oh, look at that
little sleep sack.

24:16.872 --> 24:18.581
Isn't that cute?

24:18.582 --> 24:21.333
What a clever solution for
transitioning out of the

24:21.334 --> 24:22.960
swaddle.

24:22.961 --> 24:24.712
Wait a second.

24:24.713 --> 24:25.713
Did you set this up?

24:25.714 --> 24:27.715
Are you trying to force
the baby issue again?

24:27.716 --> 24:28.716
What?

24:28.717 --> 24:29.717
No!

24:29.718 --> 24:30.718
Me?

24:30.719 --> 24:31.719
No.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.721
I mean, I'm not even
here to meet you.

24:33.722 --> 24:34.722
I'm here to meet Madis-- oh.

24:34.723 --> 24:35.723
Oh, my God.

24:35.724 --> 24:36.724
Oh, man.

24:36.725 --> 24:37.725
No.

24:37.726 --> 24:38.976
This must have been Madison.

24:38.977 --> 24:40.311
No, she does stuff like this.

24:40.312 --> 24:41.520
Oh, she is so clever.

24:41.521 --> 24:44.064
What she did was she knew that
there was a baby shower today,

24:44.065 --> 24:47.109
and she had both of us come here
so we could have our little baby

24:47.110 --> 24:48.110
fight.

24:48.111 --> 24:50.112
(laughs) Why would
she want that?

24:50.113 --> 24:52.656
Well, because she wants to
break us up because she wants a

24:52.657 --> 24:53.657
sibling.

24:53.658 --> 24:54.658
Oh.

24:54.659 --> 24:55.659
(laughing): Oh.

24:55.660 --> 24:56.660
Wow.

24:56.661 --> 24:58.662
Yeah, I mean, she's really
trying to push the issue

24:58.663 --> 25:01.081
because, you know, you and I
have been at this impasse so

25:01.082 --> 25:02.082
long.

25:02.083 --> 25:03.083
Yeah.

25:03.084 --> 25:05.086
Yeah, we have.

25:12.344 --> 25:13.344
Joshua.

25:13.345 --> 25:18.349
The truth is...

25:18.350 --> 25:21.602
...oh, this is so hard
to do, because I...

25:21.603 --> 25:25.397
I love you a lot, but...

25:25.398 --> 25:27.441
I'm not happy anymore
because of this.

25:27.442 --> 25:32.447
Maybe having a baby
started out as a whim,

25:34.449 --> 25:36.575
but it's what I want
for my life now.

25:36.576 --> 25:39.078
And you don't want a
baby, maybe not ever.

25:39.079 --> 25:42.289
I mean, you made that clear,
and, t-that's not gonna change.

25:42.290 --> 25:43.290
Yeah.

25:43.291 --> 25:44.291
Yeah.

25:44.292 --> 25:45.292
No, I know.

25:45.293 --> 25:47.294
I mean, I am always
gonna care about you.

25:47.295 --> 25:49.297
I really am.

25:51.925 --> 25:52.925
'Cause I love you.

25:52.926 --> 25:54.134
I...

25:54.135 --> 25:57.012
I love you, too.

25:57.013 --> 26:00.140
But...

26:00.141 --> 26:03.687
(sighs) Yeah.

26:09.901 --> 26:10.901
Oh.

26:10.902 --> 26:11.902
Oh, wait.

26:11.903 --> 26:12.945
So this is...

26:12.946 --> 26:14.863
Yeah, I guess it is.

26:14.864 --> 26:16.949
God, this sucks.

26:16.950 --> 26:22.538
I don't know what
to do-- can we...

26:22.539 --> 26:28.794
Can we still be friends,
or...? I don't know.

26:28.795 --> 26:33.173
I mean, I would love that.

26:33.174 --> 26:35.218
But that just sounds
so hard right now.

26:37.721 --> 26:40.055
Did a nine-year-old just trick
us into doing something we

26:40.056 --> 26:42.057
weren't brave enough
to do ourselves?

26:42.058 --> 26:45.060
(laughs softly) I think so.

26:45.061 --> 26:50.066
Huh.

26:53.778 --> 26:55.988
I don't understand what
you feel so bad about.

26:55.989 --> 26:58.115
So you had a little phone
action with some guy.

26:58.116 --> 27:00.200
Where's the harm in that?

27:00.201 --> 27:01.410
I mean, I do it, too.

27:01.411 --> 27:05.414
For $9.95 an hour, you
get a real French girl.

27:05.415 --> 27:06.582
They're not French, Bob.

27:06.583 --> 27:07.666
They're French enough.

27:07.667 --> 27:08.959
Go ahead.

27:08.960 --> 27:10.085
Give it another try.

27:10.086 --> 27:11.086
Are you sure?

27:11.087 --> 27:13.088
I don't want to
break more stuff.

27:13.089 --> 27:14.423
BOB: Oh, come on.

27:14.424 --> 27:17.092
Live a little.

27:17.093 --> 27:21.263
Have a vodka, dingle yourself
while you're texting a guy,

27:21.264 --> 27:22.931
throw a dart out the window.

27:22.932 --> 27:24.058
Go ahead.

27:24.059 --> 27:26.477
(dart clattering) Or behind you.

27:26.478 --> 27:27.478
Throw it behind you.

27:27.479 --> 27:28.562
How does that feel?

27:28.563 --> 27:29.772
Feels good, right?

27:29.773 --> 27:30.773
Yeah, you know what?

27:30.774 --> 27:33.734
It does feel good to
be outside the bubble.

27:33.735 --> 27:34.735
You're right.

27:34.736 --> 27:36.987
I'm having the best
time right now.

27:36.988 --> 27:39.323
You're like the dad I never had.

27:39.324 --> 27:40.324
You didn't have a dad?

27:40.325 --> 27:41.825
I do, but he sucks.

27:41.826 --> 27:43.619
I'll get it.

27:43.620 --> 27:48.625
(glass shatters) I just made a
new buddy He and I bonded right

27:50.960 --> 27:55.965
away It was a piece of cake with
no emotional stakes I got only

28:02.097 --> 28:08.435
good things to say About my
friend's dad My friend's dad

28:08.436 --> 28:13.441
It's all the fun of having a dad
Without the painful history She

28:16.277 --> 28:20.989
has spunk And he's a literal
drunk But that don't bother me

28:20.990 --> 28:27.496
'Cause he's not my dad He's my
friend's dad It's the healthiest

28:27.497 --> 28:34.044
relationship I've had with a
man That fact I must confess He

28:34.045 --> 28:39.466
doesn't push my buttons 'Cept
the buttons on this cute

28:39.467 --> 28:40.467
dress...

28:40.468 --> 28:41.677
Doot, doot, doot!

28:41.678 --> 28:46.014
(laughs) It's nothing but
platonic His bigotry's ironic...

28:46.015 --> 28:47.641
I like you.

28:47.642 --> 28:50.894
You barely complain
for a Jewish.

28:50.895 --> 28:51.979
Oh, you.

28:51.980 --> 28:57.443
If we were related We'd
probably fight a lot Wait,

28:57.444 --> 28:59.069
what about Jews?

28:59.070 --> 29:03.949
Here, have some more
booze What was I saying?

29:03.950 --> 29:08.955
Oh, well I forgot, glug, glug My
friend's dad My friend's dad And

29:11.040 --> 29:15.919
when she's not around I
think about her naked...

29:15.920 --> 29:16.920
Huh?

29:16.921 --> 29:17.963
Nothing, kiddo.

29:17.964 --> 29:19.173
My friend's dad.

29:19.174 --> 29:24.219
The V8 engine is man's
greatest artistic achievement.

29:24.220 --> 29:26.638
Yeah, it's like the Sistine
Chapel of car stuff.

29:26.639 --> 29:33.270
(laughs) (music volume
increases) Do you believe...

29:33.271 --> 29:37.191
You want to dance?

29:37.192 --> 29:38.192
Me?

29:38.193 --> 29:42.362
Do you see any other
beautiful women in here?

29:42.363 --> 29:43.363
Uh...

29:43.364 --> 29:46.158
In letting Me hold...

29:46.159 --> 29:47.701
(laughing): Oh.

29:47.702 --> 29:49.203
You tight...

29:49.204 --> 29:50.204
What?

29:50.205 --> 29:55.210
(gasps) Kissed you good night
I want to know Please tell me

29:59.130 --> 30:00.130
so...

30:00.131 --> 30:03.175
What are we doing?

30:03.176 --> 30:05.886
We're just two old
friends, catching up.

30:05.887 --> 30:07.471
Do you believe...

30:07.472 --> 30:10.432
Going back in time.

30:10.433 --> 30:11.517
Like Outlander.

30:11.518 --> 30:13.143
What?

30:13.144 --> 30:18.149
(laughs) Oh, God, you make
me feel like I am 17 again,

30:22.111 --> 30:24.488
and all my worries
are just gone.

30:24.489 --> 30:28.492
In my real life, I'm
always someone's mom,

30:28.493 --> 30:34.540
someone's best friend,
someone's errand girl, but...

30:34.541 --> 30:39.503
you make me feel...

30:39.504 --> 30:40.754
...special.

30:40.755 --> 30:45.634
(laughs) And you make me
feel like a terrible dancer.

30:45.635 --> 30:46.635
You got moves.

30:46.636 --> 30:49.763
Wha-- oh, ooh!

30:49.764 --> 30:56.436
(laughs) Whoa, whoa,
whoa Oo Yeah...

30:56.437 --> 30:57.521
So...

30:57.522 --> 31:01.984
Uh, I'll call you?

31:01.985 --> 31:04.194
I guess.

31:04.195 --> 31:06.405
Is that...

31:06.406 --> 31:08.615
Yes, no.

31:08.616 --> 31:09.992
I...

31:09.993 --> 31:11.326
I'll just see you around.

31:11.327 --> 31:12.327
Maybe?

31:12.328 --> 31:15.163
Well, we've been saying
good-bye for about two hours.

31:15.164 --> 31:17.165
(laughs): So, guess we should...

31:17.166 --> 31:18.166
probably go.

31:18.167 --> 31:20.335
Yeah, you're right.

31:20.336 --> 31:21.336
Who should go first?

31:21.337 --> 31:22.337
Uh...

31:22.338 --> 31:23.338
JOSH: Here comes the big boy.

31:23.339 --> 31:25.799
(dance music
playing) Hey, there.

31:25.800 --> 31:28.385
Can I make you a Joshtini?

31:28.386 --> 31:29.845
(laughing): Oh, my God.

31:29.846 --> 31:30.887
Oh, my God.

31:30.888 --> 31:32.306
Sit down, sit down.

31:32.307 --> 31:33.307
Look at this.

31:33.308 --> 31:34.308
Oh, no.

31:34.309 --> 31:35.309
Actually, we're on our way out.

31:35.310 --> 31:36.310
What?

31:36.311 --> 31:37.311
No.

31:37.312 --> 31:38.312
No, you can't leave.

31:38.313 --> 31:39.313
What are you-- look at Josh.

31:39.314 --> 31:40.772
You guys can't miss this.

31:40.773 --> 31:42.816
He thinks he's Tom
Cruise in Cocktail.

31:42.817 --> 31:43.817
It-it's amazing.

31:43.818 --> 31:44.818
JOSH: Yeah.

31:44.819 --> 31:45.819
Cannot be missed.

31:45.820 --> 31:47.571
Okay.

31:47.572 --> 31:48.572
I'm staying.

31:48.573 --> 31:49.573
Yes.

31:49.574 --> 31:50.574
You're making the right call.

31:50.575 --> 31:51.867
Ah...

31:51.868 --> 31:57.080
I'm starting to
worry about Paula.

31:57.081 --> 31:59.708
She's not answering her phone,
she's been at church for, like,

31:59.709 --> 32:00.709
nine hours.

32:00.710 --> 32:01.710
Church?

32:01.711 --> 32:03.420
Nine hours on a Saturday?

32:03.421 --> 32:04.421
Well, yeah.

32:04.422 --> 32:06.423
I mean, she said she ran
into a friend with, like,

32:06.424 --> 32:07.424
a cool Camaro or something?

32:07.425 --> 32:10.510
Um, oh, right, her name
is Sheila Girlfacce.

32:10.511 --> 32:12.763
You probably know her
as Sheila Girlface.

32:12.764 --> 32:13.764
So, that's a fake name.

32:13.765 --> 32:14.765
I fell for that.

32:14.766 --> 32:15.766
Camaro?

32:15.767 --> 32:16.767
I know what this is about.

32:16.768 --> 32:19.770
Come on, let's go.

32:19.771 --> 32:23.774
You told me...

32:23.775 --> 32:25.567
Can I ask you something?

32:25.568 --> 32:28.403
Anything.

32:28.404 --> 32:31.782
Do you ever think about us?

32:31.783 --> 32:34.242
Do you ever regret our breakup?

32:34.243 --> 32:37.204
But there is one thing...

32:37.205 --> 32:38.372
You want the truth?

32:38.373 --> 32:39.373
I really do.

32:39.374 --> 32:41.376
Yeah.

32:42.460 --> 32:43.460
I regret it.

32:43.461 --> 32:44.461
Big-time.

32:44.462 --> 32:46.588
Before you...

32:46.589 --> 32:48.715
(whispering): Really?

32:48.716 --> 32:49.716
Yeah.

32:49.717 --> 32:51.802
I never should've let you go.

32:51.803 --> 32:55.597
It was a big mistake.

32:55.598 --> 32:59.434
When you leave me, no...

32:59.435 --> 33:00.435
Ooh!

33:00.436 --> 33:01.436
Well...

33:01.437 --> 33:04.773
that was all I needed.

33:04.774 --> 33:05.774
What?

33:05.775 --> 33:06.775
Yeah.

33:06.776 --> 33:11.781
(shotgun cocks) Take one step
closer to her and I'll turn you

33:15.493 --> 33:18.537
into a great soprano.

33:18.538 --> 33:20.163
Paula, what's going on?

33:20.164 --> 33:21.164
Who is that?

33:21.165 --> 33:24.668
BOB: This is Jeff, the guy
that broke Paula's heart.

33:24.669 --> 33:29.381
She drew pictures of his johnson
with hearts around it for years

33:29.382 --> 33:30.382
after that.

33:30.383 --> 33:32.384
Dad, why do you know that?

33:32.385 --> 33:34.845
Because you left your diary
on that shelf in the bathroom.

33:34.846 --> 33:36.888
Dad, would you put the gun down?

33:36.889 --> 33:37.973
I was leaving, anyway.

33:37.974 --> 33:42.979
(sighs) It was so good to see
you again and it was so good to

33:47.024 --> 33:49.443
hear you say what you said.

33:49.444 --> 33:55.741
Thank you.

33:55.742 --> 33:56.908
All right, let's go.

33:56.909 --> 33:57.993
Give me the keys.

33:57.994 --> 33:58.994
I'm driving.

33:58.995 --> 33:59.995
No, no, no, it's okay.

33:59.996 --> 34:00.996
Bob can drive.

34:00.997 --> 34:02.998
He drives really
well when he's drunk.

34:02.999 --> 34:05.292
(sighs) (chuckles
softly) Ah, yeah.

34:05.293 --> 34:06.334
Damn.

34:06.335 --> 34:09.463
Like a curtain...

34:09.464 --> 34:14.427
(scat singing) She's a
beauty, I'm the beast...

34:17.722 --> 34:23.059
(cheering, applause)
Oh, my gosh.

34:23.060 --> 34:24.478
Yeah, he's really going for it.

34:24.478 --> 34:26.480
Oh.

34:26.481 --> 34:28.523
Oh!

34:28.524 --> 34:29.900
What is that thing on his face?

34:29.900 --> 34:31.902
WHITE JOSH: I don't
know, but it's alive.

34:31.902 --> 34:32.902
HECTOR: I can't look away.

34:32.904 --> 34:37.449
I should, but I can't.

34:37.449 --> 34:40.702
(scat singing) Whoa.

34:40.703 --> 34:43.914
Oh, my God.

34:43.915 --> 34:45.123
Whoa.

34:45.123 --> 34:48.585
Josh, um, your face is infected.

34:48.585 --> 34:51.797
You didn't, like, touch some
dirty glasses and then try to

34:51.797 --> 34:53.840
pop a pimple on
your face, did you?

34:53.841 --> 34:56.760
(laughing): No,
I'm not an idiot.

34:56.761 --> 34:57.969
You're just afraid to compete.

34:57.970 --> 34:58.970
HEATHER: No.

34:58.971 --> 34:59.971
I'm serious.

34:59.972 --> 35:01.973
I think that's a
staph infection.

35:01.974 --> 35:06.144
(scat singing) JOSH: Oh,
oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:06.145 --> 35:07.854
Here we go.

35:07.855 --> 35:10.732
Light shining
through the window...

35:10.733 --> 35:11.733
Huh?

35:11.734 --> 35:13.026
You like that?

35:13.027 --> 35:19.407
(laughs) (grunts, hums) - Window
Like light through a window...

35:19.408 --> 35:21.701
For you, my lady.

35:21.702 --> 35:22.869
Hey, Josh.

35:22.870 --> 35:28.667
So, um, I'm a nurse and that
looks like a staph infection.

35:28.668 --> 35:30.585
JOSH: Guys, I'm fine.

35:30.586 --> 35:31.586
Check this out.

35:31.587 --> 35:36.592
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey An we'll be on...

35:38.678 --> 35:45.058
(gasps) (all gasping,
groaning) (gags) I'm gonna go.

35:45.059 --> 35:46.059
Bye.

35:46.060 --> 35:48.562
(gasps) REBECCA:
So, you didn't kiss?

35:48.563 --> 35:50.272
PAULA: No, thank God.

35:50.273 --> 35:51.898
Scott was right.

35:51.899 --> 35:54.442
I have always treated him like
the consolation prize and it's

35:54.443 --> 35:56.903
because Jeff rejected me.

35:56.904 --> 35:59.322
He was always this ideal
thing that I couldn't have,

35:59.323 --> 36:05.579
but I got to reject him, so now
he's no longer on some kind of

36:05.580 --> 36:06.580
pedestal.

36:06.581 --> 36:08.915
I can finally move on from
wondering what could've been

36:08.916 --> 36:13.879
with Jeff Channington because
this time I got to make the

36:13.880 --> 36:14.838
choice.

36:14.839 --> 36:15.839
Wow.

36:15.840 --> 36:22.012
Paula, I just, it blows my mind
that I didn't know any of this.

36:22.013 --> 36:24.014
You know that I want you to
tell me this stuff, right?

36:24.015 --> 36:25.015
Babe...

36:25.016 --> 36:27.017
you are trying to get better
after something really huge and

36:27.018 --> 36:28.018
traumatic.

36:28.019 --> 36:29.102
I do not want to burden you.

36:29.103 --> 36:30.645
I want to take care of you.

36:30.646 --> 36:34.191
No, no, no, that's what you've
always done, Paula, and...

36:34.192 --> 36:37.736
(sighs) I love that ever since
we met you have tried to be like

36:37.737 --> 36:43.408
my mom, but from now on, how
about we just be best friends?

36:43.409 --> 36:47.037
But you're the little spoon and
I'm the big spoon and that's how

36:47.038 --> 36:48.038
it works.

36:48.039 --> 36:49.039
I mean, you said so yourself.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.040
I shouldn't have said that.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.875
That's not what we should be.

36:51.876 --> 36:53.877
I mean, 'cause you know what
size spoons fit together the

36:53.878 --> 36:54.878
best?

36:54.879 --> 36:56.338
No.

36:56.339 --> 36:57.547
Same-size spoons.

36:57.548 --> 36:59.299
Aw.

36:59.300 --> 37:01.092
Hey.

37:01.093 --> 37:03.053
They do.

37:03.054 --> 37:04.429
That's perfect.

37:04.430 --> 37:06.431
(laughing): Yeah, I
just thought of that.

37:06.432 --> 37:07.432
I like that.

37:07.433 --> 37:08.516
Same-size spoons.

37:08.517 --> 37:09.517
Okay.

37:09.518 --> 37:15.565
I like it.

37:15.566 --> 37:20.571
(both laugh) How you feeling,
flair champ of West Covina?

37:23.366 --> 37:26.242
I have ten more
days of antibiotics.

37:26.243 --> 37:27.243
You were right.

37:27.244 --> 37:28.870
It was a staph infection.

37:28.871 --> 37:30.121
Heather, I could've died.

37:30.122 --> 37:33.416
I took people's germs and
smeared them into my face.

37:33.417 --> 37:34.417
Mm-hmm.

37:34.418 --> 37:36.086
Feel so stupid.

37:36.087 --> 37:38.129
I was so wrong.

37:38.130 --> 37:40.131
I'm not a big boy,
I'm a small boy.

37:40.132 --> 37:41.132
Oh.

37:41.133 --> 37:44.094
Look, dumb stuff happens
to all of us, Josh.

37:44.095 --> 37:45.387
Don't, like, beat yourself up.

37:45.388 --> 37:47.514
And also, you're a man.

37:47.515 --> 37:49.808
Oh, that was the word.

37:49.809 --> 37:52.936
(scoffs) Mm-hmm.

37:52.937 --> 37:56.106
(sighs) Heather...

37:56.107 --> 37:57.107
I'm spiraling.

37:57.108 --> 38:02.070
I have no apartment, no
relationship, no career goals.

38:02.071 --> 38:05.907
I just feel like there's no
ground under me, you know?

38:05.908 --> 38:07.242
Yeah.

38:07.243 --> 38:09.077
Well, you'll figure it out.

38:09.078 --> 38:11.079
I'm still figuring
things out and I'm, like,

38:11.080 --> 38:13.081
way smarter and
cooler than you are.

38:13.082 --> 38:15.375
(scoffs) Are you?

38:15.376 --> 38:16.376
Yeah.

38:16.377 --> 38:17.377
I am.

38:17.378 --> 38:18.378
You do magic.

38:18.379 --> 38:20.255
Exactly.

38:20.256 --> 38:21.256
Exactly.

38:21.257 --> 38:24.759
PAULA: All right.

38:24.760 --> 38:25.927
We got to get to the airport.

38:25.928 --> 38:30.933
So, um, thanks for trying
to shoot Jeff, Dad.

38:33.269 --> 38:34.269
Meant a lot.

38:34.270 --> 38:36.271
Yeah, well, thanks for
coming and visiting me.

38:36.272 --> 38:39.065
I mean, I know I'm just an old
pain who reads your diaries and

38:39.066 --> 38:40.316
number-twos in your drawers.

38:40.317 --> 38:41.317
What?

38:41.318 --> 38:43.319
(laughing): Bob,
you're the worst.

38:43.320 --> 38:44.863
(laughs) Okay, let's go.

38:44.864 --> 38:47.240
Hey, wait a minute, Paula.

38:47.241 --> 38:48.241
Uh...

38:48.242 --> 38:51.411
Rebecca tells me
that you're, uh,

38:51.412 --> 38:53.413
first in your class
in law school.

38:53.414 --> 38:54.414
Um...

38:54.415 --> 38:56.583
I didn't know you
were smart like that.

38:56.584 --> 38:57.959
Yeah, I am.

38:57.960 --> 38:58.918
I'm really smart.

38:58.919 --> 39:01.212
All right, you don't have to
hit me over the head with it.

39:01.213 --> 39:04.049
But, uh, it would be nice if
you guys came back and visited

39:04.050 --> 39:05.008
again.

39:05.009 --> 39:06.009
Thanks, my friend's dad.

39:06.010 --> 39:07.010
Oh.

39:07.011 --> 39:08.803
Okay, I'll be in the car.

39:08.804 --> 39:11.514
Okay.

39:11.515 --> 39:16.520
(chuckles) (knocking
on door) Hi.

39:22.818 --> 39:23.818
Hi.

39:23.819 --> 39:25.528
How was your trip?

39:25.529 --> 39:29.199
So, remember the day I chased
you around the conference room

39:29.200 --> 39:32.077
and then jumped on you like
a flying squirrel move?

39:32.078 --> 39:33.703
(laughs) I do.

39:33.704 --> 39:34.704
Yes.

39:34.705 --> 39:40.001
(laughs) Okay, stand back.

39:40.002 --> 39:45.256
Mmm.

39:45.257 --> 39:50.221
Are you sure this is okay
with your therapy thing?

39:58.479 --> 40:03.484
Just shut up.

40:07.530 --> 40:08.530
What?

40:08.531 --> 40:10.115
We shouldn't keep pie in here.

40:10.116 --> 40:12.492
Hey, honey.

40:12.493 --> 40:17.831
How's your dad?

40:17.832 --> 40:19.624
Same.

40:19.625 --> 40:24.963
Mm, want some?

40:24.964 --> 40:26.881
Sure.

40:26.882 --> 40:29.342
So, I want to talk to
you about something.

40:29.343 --> 40:30.343
It's important.

40:30.344 --> 40:33.012
If I could...

40:33.013 --> 40:36.850
go through a magical stone wall
and pick any man in any time

40:36.851 --> 40:40.687
period in any universe...

40:40.688 --> 40:42.981
I would pick Brad Pitt
in Thelma & Louise.

40:42.982 --> 40:44.566
Strong choice.

40:44.567 --> 40:45.567
Me same.

40:45.568 --> 40:48.528
And when he turned me down...

40:48.529 --> 40:51.156
(laughs) ...I'd pick you.

40:51.157 --> 40:52.157
Really?

40:52.158 --> 40:53.158
Yeah.

40:53.159 --> 40:54.159
Every day of the week.

40:54.160 --> 40:55.160
Right back at you.

40:55.161 --> 40:57.162
REBECCA: So, I went to
Buffalo, drank a ton of vodka,

40:57.163 --> 41:02.168
sexted with a guy, damaged a
house with darts and urine,

41:04.461 --> 41:11.009
got in a car with a drunk guy--
oops-- watched that guy threaten

41:11.010 --> 41:13.553
another guy with a gun, and I
farted a ton on the plane on the

41:13.554 --> 41:15.555
way back because no
one could hear it,

41:15.556 --> 41:17.557
and I just had a ton
of sex with my ex-boss.

41:17.558 --> 41:22.061
So, how's that for getting
out of the therapy bubble?

41:22.062 --> 41:25.190
Wow, that is not in
any workbook I know of.

41:25.191 --> 41:28.109
You know, my whole life, I've
only known how to be, like,

41:28.110 --> 41:31.613
really good or really bad.

41:31.614 --> 41:36.951
But being a human...

41:36.952 --> 41:39.078
...is living in that
kind of in-between space,

41:39.079 --> 41:42.540
it's making mistakes, and
that's very scary, but...

41:42.541 --> 41:43.666
also very cool.

41:43.667 --> 41:45.293
Great work.

41:45.294 --> 41:48.087
You, my friend, get an
A-plus on your C-plus.

41:48.088 --> 41:49.255
Yes!

41:49.256 --> 41:51.966
And I got this just for you.

41:51.967 --> 41:53.635
Pick one.

41:53.636 --> 41:54.636
Oh.

41:54.637 --> 41:56.262
(sniffs) Oh, yeah.

41:56.263 --> 41:58.557
It smells like grape.
