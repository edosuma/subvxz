<i>Sometimes when I'm quantum
leaping, I have really good days. </i>

00:17.315 --> 00:19.783
<i>Days when I win the race,</i>

00:19.850 --> 00:21.784
<i>stop the bad guy... </i>

00:21.852 --> 00:23.877
<i>and kiss the girl. </i>

00:34.832 --> 00:37.699
<i>And then there are
the bad days. </i>

00:45.509 --> 00:47.534
Oh, boy.

00:47.612 --> 00:49.546
Uh, this... this is not
what it looks like.

00:49.614 --> 00:51.548
Uh, he was dead
when I got here?

00:51.616 --> 00:54.380
Mm-hmm. Anybody besides you
and him to corroborate that?

00:54.452 --> 00:58.081
I don't know. Then you're gonna
miss the Dodger opener, Nick.

00:58.155 --> 01:00.180
I'm still in L.A.

01:00.257 --> 01:05.695
"L.A." Yeah, sure. And, uh, Ebbets
Field is in Hollywood. Call the coroner.

01:05.763 --> 01:08.596
What are you gonna do,
try the insanity plea?

02:41.792 --> 02:45.193
<i>Tales can come true</i>

02:45.262 --> 02:47.730
<i>It could happen to you</i>

02:47.798 --> 02:51.029
<i>It was 1953.</i>

02:51.102 --> 02:56.699
<i>The Dodgers were still in Brooklyn, and I
was a private detective named Nick Allen. </i>

02:56.774 --> 03:00.608
<i>The dead man on the floor
was my partner, Phil Grimsley. </i>

03:00.678 --> 03:03.408
<i>And if that wasn't enough
to cause chills,</i>

03:03.481 --> 03:05.574
<i>there was the image
in the mirror. </i>

03:07.852 --> 03:10.412
<i>Play it again, Sam. </i>

03:13.491 --> 03:16.085
Uh, am I Bogie?

03:16.160 --> 03:20.722
No. No, he's on Long Island with
Audrey Hepburn making "Sabrina".

03:20.798 --> 03:22.959
But the resemblance
is amazing.

03:23.033 --> 03:25.900
That might be why Nick
became a gumshoe.

03:25.970 --> 03:27.904
Gumshoe?

03:27.972 --> 03:30.770
Shamus, tec, dick.

03:30.841 --> 03:33.605
You don't know the lingo.

03:33.677 --> 03:35.611
I don't remember.

03:35.679 --> 03:38.341
What kind of peep
are you gonna make?

03:38.415 --> 03:40.940
At least I remember him.

03:41.018 --> 03:44.476
Here's lookin' at you, kid.

03:44.555 --> 03:47.991
If you're through playing,
can we get down to business?

03:48.058 --> 03:51.186
Yeah. I'm sorry.
Um, what am I here to do?

03:51.262 --> 03:53.696
Find the killer probably.

03:53.764 --> 03:55.891
Then I didn't do it!
Uh, Nick didn't do it.

03:55.966 --> 03:59.299
Uh, Ziggy says
it's 4-to-1 against.

03:59.370 --> 04:01.634
Your partner Phil
was into seedy divorce cases,

04:01.705 --> 04:03.764
so he was probably
of fed by someone...

04:03.841 --> 04:07.368
he snapshot
in a compromising position or two.

04:07.444 --> 04:09.935
Who? Well, there's no data on that.

04:10.014 --> 04:11.948
You're the shamus.
You figure it out.

04:12.016 --> 04:14.109
I'm not the shamus.

04:14.185 --> 04:16.380
Oh, you know.

04:20.658 --> 04:22.592
You dirty rat.

04:22.660 --> 04:25.128
You dirty, rotten rat.
No, Sam.

04:25.196 --> 04:27.596
You killed my brother...
S- Sam!

04:27.665 --> 04:30.691
That's Cagney, not Bogart.

04:30.768 --> 04:33.498
Yeah. Uh, right.

04:33.571 --> 04:37.473
Yeah, well, I gotta go.
Tina's got this friend.

04:37.541 --> 04:41.443
Al, don't tell me you're
cheating on Tina with her friend.

04:41.512 --> 04:45.846
A friend that knows a guy who's
got a kid that works for a trainer,

04:45.916 --> 04:49.181
who happens to have a sure thing
in the fourth race at Santa Anita.

04:49.253 --> 04:51.585
Now don't you feel bad
about jumping to conclusions?

04:51.655 --> 04:53.589
No, I don't feel bad.

04:53.657 --> 04:57.184
Al, I'm in jail for a murder I didn't
commit in the decade that I was born.

04:57.261 --> 04:59.957
All you care about
is getting to...

05:02.266 --> 05:04.996
What? What?

05:05.069 --> 05:07.936
- I'm gonna be set free.
- By whom?

05:08.005 --> 05:10.872
You!

05:10.941 --> 05:14.377
You, you I'm in love with you
Al, don't ask me how I know this,

05:14.445 --> 05:19.815
but any second, a bald detective with
a cigar is gonna come walking through...

05:19.884 --> 05:23.877
That door and tell me that
the bullet that Grimsley took...

05:23.954 --> 05:25.888
didn't come from my gun.

05:25.956 --> 05:29.756
You're outta here, Nick. Ballistics
said the slugs Grimsley stopped...

05:29.827 --> 05:31.852
didn't match your gun.

05:31.929 --> 05:34.261
- Déjà vu.
- I don't think so.

05:34.331 --> 05:36.595
Fine, stay here
for all I care.

05:36.667 --> 05:40.569
Uh, no. That's not what I
meant. I wanna get out. Really.

05:44.375 --> 05:48.106
Well, if you're outta here,
I'll see you later.

05:48.178 --> 05:52.080
Al, I...

05:52.149 --> 05:55.312
You've been hit in the head
too many times with a sap, Nick.

06:17.174 --> 06:20.302
<i>In a funny way, that
detective might have been right. </i>

06:20.377 --> 06:24.643
<i>Maybe leaping from one year to another
had done more than Swiss cheese my brain,</i>

06:24.715 --> 06:28.116
<i>because the feeling of déjà vu
had just struck again. </i>

06:28.185 --> 06:32.144
<i>Someone in publishing named
Seymour was about to speak to me. </i>

06:32.222 --> 06:34.520
- Seymour?
- Bogie.

06:34.591 --> 06:36.525
Oh, uh, no, ma'am.

06:36.593 --> 06:39.357
He's in Long Island with Audrey
Hepburn and William Holden.

06:47.738 --> 06:48.185
Nick!

06:48.185 --> 06:49.774
<i>I knew them all. </i>

06:49.774 --> 06:52.633
<i>The older guy was Lionel,
the building superintendent. </i>

06:52.710 --> 06:56.806
<i>The elevator operator was Chuck, and
Seymour was the boy behind the news stand. </i>

06:56.880 --> 06:59.212
<i>I guess you could consider that
being in publishing. </i>

06:59.283 --> 07:01.911
Sorry about Phil, Nick.
You okay?

07:01.986 --> 07:05.752
I can't believe Phil's gone. Seems like
yesterday that I was taking him up and down.

07:05.823 --> 07:07.814
It was yesterday.

07:09.994 --> 07:11.962
How'd Allison take it?

07:12.029 --> 07:15.897
How bad could she take it? A body like
that doesn't marry a guy like Phil for love.

07:15.966 --> 07:18.161
Any idea who killed him?

07:18.235 --> 07:21.227
Word on the street is he was
fogged by a dropper called Klapper.

07:21.305 --> 07:24.240
A dropper called Klapper?

07:24.308 --> 07:26.242
Why would a dropper be
after Phil? Are you kidding?

07:26.310 --> 07:29.006
I bet Phil and Nick put a dozen
Hard Harry’s in the slammer.

07:29.079 --> 07:32.071
Any one of them could have paid
a dropper to fog him. Right, Nick?

07:33.150 --> 07:35.084
Well, I-I hope not.

07:35.152 --> 07:38.781
- I don't like tenants with hit men after them.
- No, no, neither do I.

07:38.856 --> 07:40.881
What are you gonna
do, let the cops handle it?

07:40.958 --> 07:44.826
Are you kidding? The man's partner buys it,
he doesn't stop until he nails the dropper.

07:44.895 --> 07:49.332
Like Tommy Trueblood. Tommy's partner
was found in the Pacific, sucking kelp.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.425
Tommy had to take on
the cops, the mob,

07:51.502 --> 07:54.403
and bad criminal elements,
but he got the dropper.

07:54.471 --> 07:56.405
And that's what you're
gonna do, right, Nick?

07:58.475 --> 08:01.137
Well, I-I don't know.
But not here.

08:01.211 --> 08:03.372
I don't want any shooting
around here.

08:03.447 --> 08:05.540
It frightens the tenants.

08:05.616 --> 08:08.779
Well, I'll, uh,
I'll try not to get shot...

08:08.852 --> 08:10.786
here.

08:17.594 --> 08:19.528
Something wrong?

08:19.596 --> 08:22.190
You never paid me
for a paper before.

08:23.400 --> 08:26.699
Well, it's about time I started.

08:33.342 --> 08:35.777
What's the record? Twelve
minutes and eight seconds.

08:35.846 --> 08:37.780
It didn't take that long.

08:37.847 --> 08:40.078
I got a buck says
he can't fix it quicker.

08:40.150 --> 08:43.278
Make that two.
You want a piece of this, Nick?

08:52.663 --> 08:54.756
Gee, thanks, Nick.

08:54.832 --> 08:56.766
You're welcome.

09:14.885 --> 09:16.876
Thanks.

09:21.692 --> 09:27.653
Uh, Nick. I, uh, I got these tickets
to the Dodger game tomorrow, and, um...

09:27.731 --> 09:32.464
Oh, uh, thanks, Chuck, but I don't
think I'll be able to make it.

09:32.536 --> 09:34.470
Oh, I didn't mean you.

09:34.538 --> 09:37.996
I was wondering if maybe you could
ask Allison if she wanted to go.

09:38.075 --> 09:40.669
You know, to take her mind
off Phil's dying.

09:41.778 --> 09:45.270
Yeah, right.
It's too soon.

09:45.349 --> 09:47.283
It's a bad idea.

09:55.993 --> 10:00.020
<i>I was still trying to figure out how
anyone could be as tasteless as Chuck... </i>

10:01.298 --> 10:04.665
<i>when the déjà vu
feeling hit me again. </i>

10:11.141 --> 10:13.507
<i>Someone was in my office. </i>

10:14.778 --> 10:17.770
<i>Someone... dangerous. </i>

10:21.552 --> 10:24.453
<i>Boy, was I right. </i>

10:24.521 --> 10:27.456
Oh, Nick,
it's so horrible.

10:27.524 --> 10:29.458
When I found out the police
thought you killed Phil...

10:29.526 --> 10:31.858
Allison. I was so afraid
they'd find out about us.

10:33.163 --> 10:35.563
Oh, boy. I mean, it would be motive...

10:35.632 --> 10:37.566
for you to kill Phil.

10:37.634 --> 10:39.568
Wouldn't it?

10:39.636 --> 10:41.968
Uh, yeah.

10:42.039 --> 10:44.166
But you didn't.

10:44.241 --> 10:46.209
No.

10:46.276 --> 10:49.074
Oh, Nick, I'm so glad.

10:49.146 --> 10:52.946
I don't know if I could love
a man who killed my husband.

10:54.985 --> 10:57.419
But if you didn't do it,
who did?

10:57.487 --> 11:00.456
Phil ever mention someone
called Klapper?

11:00.524 --> 11:02.458
The dropper?

11:02.526 --> 11:05.017
You know him?
No.

11:05.095 --> 11:10.397
One night in bed... Uh, you
know we slept in twin beds.

11:10.467 --> 11:12.662
Uh-huh.
Yeah.

11:12.736 --> 11:15.705
Well, one night Phil
was having this nightmare,

11:15.772 --> 11:19.640
mumbling something
about a dropper named Klapper.

11:19.710 --> 11:21.769
Is he the murderer?

11:22.779 --> 11:26.977
Could be.
Oh, Nick, I'm so scared.

11:27.050 --> 11:31.419
I can't go back to my apartment.
I just can't.

11:31.488 --> 11:34.150
Don't you have
somewhere else to stay?

11:35.592 --> 11:37.924
Well, what about your place?

11:40.330 --> 11:42.298
My place?

11:42.366 --> 11:46.393
Well, I-I know
it's a little sudden,

11:46.470 --> 11:49.928
maybe in bad taste,

11:50.007 --> 11:52.168
but Phillip's dead.

11:52.242 --> 11:55.473
And we've been waiting
so long.

11:57.381 --> 12:00.145
Waiting?
You mean, we never...

12:01.451 --> 12:07.117
No, of course we never.
Phil... Phillip was your husband.

12:07.190 --> 12:09.124
And your partner.
Yeah.

12:09.192 --> 12:11.592
And a man can't...

12:11.662 --> 12:15.029
With his partner's wife.

12:15.098 --> 12:18.363
Until his partner... is gone.

12:40.057 --> 12:43.390
Thank you.

13:25.769 --> 13:27.703
"I found Phil emptying a bottle...

13:27.771 --> 13:32.105
"with a hand shakier
than a grass skirt on Waikiki.

13:32.175 --> 13:36.407
"He looked like a cat
working on his ninth life...

13:36.480 --> 13:40.382
ever since he heard a dropper
named Klapper was looking for him. "

13:42.018 --> 13:44.111
It's not déjà vu.

13:46.723 --> 13:48.850
I read this book.

13:53.397 --> 13:55.490
"She was a flamer.

13:55.565 --> 13:59.296
A redhead who could make
Father Flanagan forget Boys Town. "

13:59.369 --> 14:01.701
My first wife
was just like that.

14:01.772 --> 14:04.798
Al. Look, I read this book,
Nick's writing.

14:04.875 --> 14:08.106
That's why I know everything.
It's not déjà vu.

14:08.178 --> 14:11.670
Another illusion
shattered forever.

14:11.748 --> 14:13.875
Nick and Allison
loved each other,

14:13.950 --> 14:16.544
but they were too loyal to Phil
to do anything about it.

14:16.620 --> 14:18.554
Listen to this.

14:18.622 --> 14:21.819
"The heat between us was like
a six-day jaunt in the Sahara,

14:21.892 --> 14:25.953
but our ties to Phil were as tight
as the drunk on the corner stool. "

14:26.029 --> 14:29.931
- Not exactly Faulkner.
- Yeah, you can say that again.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.834
I think I'm here to find Phil's killer, so that
Allison and I can live happily ever after.

14:33.904 --> 14:36.600
Sam, don't you mean
Allison and Nick?

14:38.208 --> 14:40.768
Well, yeah, sure.

14:42.212 --> 14:46.114
Sam, you know,
Allison could be the killer.

14:47.184 --> 14:48.811
No.
No?

14:48.885 --> 14:52.184
- No.
- No? Why do you say no?

14:52.255 --> 14:55.588
Because "her body
could part the Red Army"?

14:55.659 --> 15:00.187
No, because...
we've got Klapper.

15:00.263 --> 15:03.596
Careful, Sam. There was no cure for that in 1953.

15:03.667 --> 15:07.865
Al, Klapper is the dropper who shot
Phil. At least that's the rumor.

15:07.938 --> 15:11.339
Yeah, but people hire droppers.
It wasn't Allison.

15:11.408 --> 15:15.174
But whoever it was
is probably here in Nick's book.

15:15.245 --> 15:20.205
So, if you could just find me...
"Dead Men Don't Die".

15:20.283 --> 15:23.775
Uh, I doubt that it was published
under that title.

15:23.854 --> 15:25.788
Check under Nick Allen.

15:25.856 --> 15:28.848
Maybe he used a nom de plume.
I would.

15:28.925 --> 15:31.621
Just have Ziggy do it, okay?
That's what computers are for.

15:31.695 --> 15:35.392
Just find me the rest of this book, because for
the life of me, I can't remember how it ended.

15:35.465 --> 15:37.831
Well, it wasn't with Allison and
Nick living happily ever after.

15:37.901 --> 15:41.098
You read it?
No. But if it ended like that,

15:41.171 --> 15:45.130
why would you be here...
so they could live unhappily ever after?

15:54.718 --> 15:56.879
<i>Maybe Al's right. </i>

15:56.953 --> 16:00.582
<i>Maybe Nick and Allison
didn't end up together. </i>

16:01.658 --> 16:03.785
<i>But that was then,</i>

16:03.860 --> 16:05.851
<i>and this is now. </i>

16:05.929 --> 16:08.454
<i>And I'm here to see
that they do. </i>

16:08.532 --> 16:13.094
<i>And to do that,
I've gotta find Phil's killer. </i>

16:18.875 --> 16:20.843
Must be Phil's...

16:32.055 --> 16:34.353
Hey, Nick, I got
a lead on the Klapper.

16:34.424 --> 16:36.585
He's gonna be
at the Blue Island tonight.

16:36.660 --> 16:40.027
I read about the Blue... Phil
told me about the Blue Island.

16:40.096 --> 16:42.894
I got tipped by a kid I was in
the orphanage with who works there,

16:42.966 --> 16:45.628
but he couldn't or wouldn't
give me a face.

16:45.702 --> 16:47.795
How are we gonna know
what he looks like?

16:47.871 --> 16:51.204
Same way Tommy Trueblood
did in The Lipstick Murders.

16:51.274 --> 16:54.539
Pose as a couple of mafioso who want to
offer him a contract. You got your roscoe?

16:54.611 --> 16:56.602
- Roscoe?
- Your piece, gat, shooter.

16:56.680 --> 16:59.410
My gun?
Uh, no, the police have it.

16:59.482 --> 17:02.508
That's okay. We always got our
dukes. Ain't that right, Nick?

17:02.586 --> 17:05.749
Yeah, that we got.
Seymour!

17:29.779 --> 17:33.146
Seymour, what...

17:39.389 --> 17:43.348
This can't happen. The doors won't
open unless the elevator's there.

17:43.426 --> 17:45.724
They can if the safety latch
is broken.

17:45.795 --> 17:48.696
Broken?
It happens.

17:48.765 --> 17:50.960
This is your fault.
Mine?

17:51.034 --> 17:53.969
I told you this elevator was old
and needed replacing.

17:54.037 --> 17:56.130
Klapper did it.

17:56.206 --> 18:00.233
I don't think so, Seymour.
Klapper's a pro, and pros rarely miss.

18:00.310 --> 18:03.768
Anyway, how could he be sure I'd use the
elevator next, or walk blindly into it?

18:03.847 --> 18:08.011
That was my fault. I distracted
you. I’m always getting in the way.

18:08.084 --> 18:12.180
Look, Seymour, it's not your
fault. I should have looked first.

18:12.255 --> 18:15.816
I've caused accidents since
I was born, probably before.

18:15.892 --> 18:18.190
Maybe that's why
my folks dumped me.

18:18.261 --> 18:22.459
Seymour,
you were abandoned?

18:22.532 --> 18:24.466
Left on a stoop
in the Village.

18:24.534 --> 18:28.129
I grew up in the East End
Orphanage, mostly in the library.

18:28.204 --> 18:30.502
Hey, there's nothing wrong
with liking to read.

18:30.573 --> 18:32.507
I slept there.

18:32.575 --> 18:34.975
Only place
nobody would bother me.

18:36.212 --> 18:38.180
If I could just be like you.

18:38.248 --> 18:40.978
What, a two-bit detective
who deals in divorce cases?

18:41.051 --> 18:44.748
Don't say that. You're
Nick Allen. You're the best.

18:44.821 --> 18:47.585
That's what I always said.

18:47.657 --> 18:49.591
Oh, boy.

18:50.660 --> 18:52.890
Something wrong?

18:52.962 --> 18:58.161
Sorry, I just never saw
a widow look like you.

18:58.234 --> 19:00.566
Can I help it
if I look good in black?

19:00.637 --> 19:02.662
Besides, I hadn't planned
on dressing tonight.

19:02.739 --> 19:05.936
- Nick, we gotta go.
- Go?

19:06.009 --> 19:08.842
We got a lead
at the Blue Island.

19:08.912 --> 19:10.846
Nick, you can't go there.
Why not?

19:10.914 --> 19:13.041
God, Nick, that's where Phillip
went the night he was killed.

19:13.116 --> 19:16.051
Why didn't you tell me?

19:16.119 --> 19:18.314
You went with him.

19:20.123 --> 19:22.591
Of course I did.

19:22.659 --> 19:25.025
- Nick, what's wrong?
- He's a little shook.

19:25.095 --> 19:27.029
He nearly fell down
the elevator shaft.

19:27.097 --> 19:28.928
- What?
- It was my fault.

19:28.998 --> 19:31.057
It was not your fault.
It was an accident.

19:31.134 --> 19:34.069
Whoever killed Phillip
is after you, isn't he?

19:34.137 --> 19:36.298
- Well...
- Klapper's a pro.

19:36.372 --> 19:41.139
He knows the code, and Nick won't stop tracking
his crushers till they're pushing daisies.

19:41.211 --> 19:44.374
Nick, please don't go
to the Blue Island.

19:44.447 --> 19:48.406
Well, I have to, Allison. You want
me to find Phillip's killer, don't you?

20:13.510 --> 20:17.606
<i>I had two theories as to why Allison
insisted on coming to the Blue Island. </i>

20:17.680 --> 20:20.740
<i>One, she had hired Klapper
to kill Phil... </i>

20:20.817 --> 20:22.751
<i>and wanted to be sure
that I didn't find him. </i>

20:22.819 --> 20:25.845
<i>Two, she really loved me...
uh, Nick... </i>

20:25.922 --> 20:27.856
<i>and was frightened for his safety. </i>

20:27.924 --> 20:31.690
I really should be frightened,
but I feel so safe in your arms.

20:31.761 --> 20:34.161
<i>Guess which one I believed?</i>

20:48.711 --> 20:50.645
You spotted him?
Who?

20:50.713 --> 20:52.647
Klapper.
No, no.

20:52.715 --> 20:56.242
Just thought I recognized an old
client. You know, messy divorce case.

20:56.319 --> 20:59.846
Thank God I didn't have to
go through that.

20:59.923 --> 21:03.120
Oh, I didn't mean that the
way it sounded, Nick. I swear.

21:03.193 --> 21:05.127
I'm...

21:15.305 --> 21:17.364
You do see him!

21:26.249 --> 21:28.717
Klapper's in the band,
isn't he?

21:28.785 --> 21:31.413
How can I spot someone if I don't
even know what he looks like?

21:31.487 --> 21:35.253
- He may look like a she.
- What?

21:35.325 --> 21:38.988
My buddy just told me the word on the
street is that Klapper's a woman.

21:40.930 --> 21:43.398
I think I'll go get us
some fresh drinks.

21:43.466 --> 21:45.696
- Oh, I'll get 'em, Nick.
- That's all right.

21:45.768 --> 21:49.204
- You stay here and keep Allison company.
- Sure!

21:51.708 --> 21:54.142
You ever read
Tommy Trueblood?

22:03.653 --> 22:05.712
Oh, Sam, wow.

22:05.788 --> 22:08.723
Allison is a killer.

22:08.791 --> 22:12.158
Nick wrote that?
Nick? Oh, the book.

22:12.228 --> 22:15.686
No, no, I'm talking
about her body... deadly.

22:15.765 --> 22:18.893
Oh, Al. She reminds me of
this redhead in billing.

22:18.968 --> 22:21.960
Al, so help me, if you start
with one of your sleazy sex stories,

22:22.038 --> 22:24.472
hologram or no hologram,
I'll slug ya.

22:24.540 --> 22:26.474
- Sleazy?
- Sleazy.

22:26.542 --> 22:30.376
Well, Sam, you know there's
sleaze and there's sleaze, please.

22:30.446 --> 22:32.573
Who killed Phil?
I don't know.

22:32.649 --> 22:34.640
What do you mean?
You got the book. I saw you.

22:34.717 --> 22:36.810
Yeah, but, you know,
it's an unfinished mystery.

22:36.886 --> 22:39.582
It's one of those contest books
they had in the '50s.

22:39.656 --> 22:45.526
You figure out who did the murder and if
the cops can prove it, then you win 10 grand.

22:45.595 --> 22:50.555
Al, it says,
"Who Killed Grimsley and Allen? "

22:50.633 --> 22:54.501
Yeah, I-I thought you'd
notice that last part.

23:07.517 --> 23:09.849
This pin jabber tried to fog him
with a stick of nitro,

23:09.919 --> 23:13.821
but Tommy smelled the blow, and creased
the horse rider with an ounce of lead.

23:13.890 --> 23:16.290
Really. That was nothing compared to the time...

23:16.359 --> 23:18.293
Tommy ran afoul
on Hound Dog Harry.

23:18.361 --> 23:21.262
He was tracking this dropper who
creased a wheelchair rider from Queens.

23:21.331 --> 23:25.199
Uh-huh.

23:25.268 --> 23:29.466
Two martinis, extra dry and a
Shirley Temple... three dollars.

23:29.539 --> 23:32.064
Three dollars?
What a rip-off.

23:32.141 --> 23:36.840
It's 1953. Any downtown bar would
charge you a buck and a quarter, tops.

23:36.913 --> 23:40.644
- How did I, uh, die?
- Back-stopped an ounce of lead.

23:40.717 --> 23:44.175
- Klapper?
- Probably. But nobody ever collected on it.

23:44.253 --> 23:46.312
Who did the readers suspect?

23:46.389 --> 23:49.051
Everybody, from Joseph Stalin
to Colonel Mustard.

23:49.125 --> 23:54.153
But most of the folks voted for
your paramour, the Red Widow.

23:54.230 --> 23:56.391
- But they didn't prove it.
- Well, they couldn't...

23:56.466 --> 23:59.526
because Allison and Seymour disappeared
on the night of Nick's murder,

23:59.602 --> 24:01.695
which, by the way,
is tonight.

24:03.106 --> 24:05.040
Allison and Seymour?

24:05.108 --> 24:08.737
Rumor has it that they
flew off to Rio together.

24:08.811 --> 24:11.844
- Cigars. Cigarettes.
- I can't believe that.

24:11.845 --> 24:12.648
Hi, Nick.

24:12.649 --> 24:15.150
It does kind of stretch
the imagination, doesn't it?

24:15.218 --> 24:20.747
But, you know, some women have
kinky taste in men. Thank you.

24:20.823 --> 24:23.690
Thank God.
Al.

24:23.760 --> 24:25.921
Maybe Klapper killed them
and then hid the bodies.

24:25.995 --> 24:29.362
No, your partner Phil, his
body was found in the office.

24:29.432 --> 24:33.892
And your... uh, Nick's body...
was found at La Guardia.

24:33.970 --> 24:37.337
So, if they were left where they were
dropped, why hide Allison and Seymour?

24:37.407 --> 24:40.069
I don't know, Al.
It just seems like...

24:40.143 --> 24:43.112
the most logical explanation.

24:43.179 --> 24:47.081
Well, the more logical one
is that Allison is Klapper.

24:47.150 --> 24:50.176
If you wanna have safe sex with her,
you'd better wear a bulletproof vest.

24:50.253 --> 24:53.586
- Al, come on.
- Oh, well, maybe I'm wrong.

24:53.656 --> 24:57.922
But with a body like that, how
could she be interested in Seymour,

24:57.994 --> 25:00.189
no matter
how kinky she is?

25:00.263 --> 25:05.291
She must have used him, and then when she
got tired of him, she blew him away in Rio.

25:05.368 --> 25:09.771
- Allison didn't blow anyone away.
- How do you know?

25:09.839 --> 25:12.603
- How do you know?
- Instinct.

25:12.675 --> 25:16.873
Well, my instinct tells me that that broad
has got you tied in knots this way, that way...

25:16.946 --> 25:19.608
Your instincts got you married
five times, right?

25:19.682 --> 25:22.446
That your Swiss
cheese brain remembers.

25:22.518 --> 25:25.214
Well, I wanna tell you
something, pal.

25:25.288 --> 25:27.654
You haven't been
getting any lately.

25:27.723 --> 25:29.657
Don't compare me to yourself.

25:29.725 --> 25:32.216
I think with my brain, and I don't
cloud my judgment with a bottle.

25:40.336 --> 25:45.000
Well, yeah, well, uh,
Tina's waiting for me.

25:45.074 --> 25:47.235
Uh, got a hot tip
in the eighth.

25:49.512 --> 25:51.742
A "Nostalgia Kills. "

25:51.814 --> 25:56.842
That's a funny name, huh,
for a filly?

25:56.919 --> 25:59.319
You take my advice, pal.

25:59.388 --> 26:03.984
Don't go near La Guardia.
Anyplace but La Guardia.

26:09.699 --> 26:13.328
<i>Why do we hurt people
for telling us the truth?</i>

26:16.005 --> 26:18.064
<i>Al was right. </i>

26:18.141 --> 26:21.076
<i>When it came to Allison,
I was as blind as a dead bat... </i>

26:21.144 --> 26:24.511
<i>and tighter than a granny knot
at a Cub Scout picnic. </i>

26:24.580 --> 26:27.344
<i>My God, I'm thinking like Seymour. </i>

26:39.295 --> 26:41.263
This is for you, Bogie.

26:57.880 --> 27:00.405
Everybody must think
Bogie looks like you.

27:00.483 --> 27:02.451
I think that's the other way
around, Seymour.

27:02.518 --> 27:04.918
Looks like it's gonna pour.
You wait here.

27:04.987 --> 27:07.512
I'll catch us a cab
on Madison.

27:14.797 --> 27:16.731
What's wrong?

27:18.201 --> 27:20.465
Look, Allison, um...

27:22.038 --> 27:24.939
Did you love Phil?

27:25.007 --> 27:26.941
What kind of a question
is that?

27:27.009 --> 27:29.102
The kind
that has to be asked.

27:29.178 --> 27:33.444
I was 16 when I met Phil.

27:34.784 --> 27:37.218
He was in Pittsburgh
for a divorce case.

27:38.988 --> 27:41.786
I guess you could say
he swept me off my feet.

27:41.857 --> 27:43.825
So you loved him.

27:43.893 --> 27:46.225
I loved the idea
of him.

27:46.295 --> 27:50.527
He was older.
He was from New York.

27:52.902 --> 27:56.303
To the daughter
of a steelworker,

27:56.372 --> 27:58.567
he was very sophisticated.

27:59.942 --> 28:01.967
Guess I was as naive
as Seymour, huh?

28:05.381 --> 28:07.315
No, I didn't love him.

28:12.888 --> 28:15.448
I think the only man
I ever loved is you.

28:41.817 --> 28:44.115
Where's that cab?

28:49.692 --> 28:52.786
I'll go get one.
Hurry.

28:55.963 --> 28:57.491
Nick!

28:57.566 --> 29:00.296
Get back!

29:07.009 --> 29:10.137
Where is he?
In the alley.

29:15.217 --> 29:17.549
He's gone.

29:19.455 --> 29:22.788
You're bleeding.

29:22.858 --> 29:25.486
Just a scratch.

29:25.561 --> 29:27.495
Angel.

29:38.407 --> 29:41.968
Sorry it took so long!

29:43.779 --> 29:46.179
Nick, you're creased.
Somebody shot at us.

29:46.248 --> 29:50.184
- Klapper?
- Gotham Towers.

29:50.252 --> 29:52.243
What took you so long, Seymour?

29:52.321 --> 29:55.017
The canaries were harder to find
than a hooker on Sunday morning.

29:55.091 --> 29:57.025
Plenty of canaries...

29:57.093 --> 29:59.687
- Plenty of cabs from what I could see.
- When I finally got one,

29:59.762 --> 30:02.959
this Hard Harry with a kisser that could
break a mirror in the next apartment...

30:03.032 --> 30:05.057
stepped on my daisy crushers...
Stop it!

30:05.134 --> 30:08.194
No one can be
as nerdy as you're acting.

30:08.270 --> 30:10.204
Nerdy?

30:10.272 --> 30:13.366
Wimpy, wussy,
dopey, goofy.

30:13.442 --> 30:15.842
You don't mean that, Nick. Every word of it.

30:15.911 --> 30:18.379
Look, you've been on me,
closer than my underwear,

30:18.447 --> 30:20.381
and it's getting boring.
Take it easy, Nick.

30:20.449 --> 30:24.385
He's gotta find out sometime that he's not gonna
be Sam Spade, Philip Marlowe or Thomas Magnum.

30:24.453 --> 30:26.785
Magnum? I don't wanna be like those guys.

30:26.856 --> 30:28.915
I just wanna be like you. Me?

30:28.991 --> 30:31.289
Kid.

30:31.360 --> 30:34.887
If I'm lucky, I'm gonna spend the rest of my life
leaping around from one place to another...

30:34.964 --> 30:37.364
instead of face down
in a pool of blood.

30:37.433 --> 30:40.129
- Don't do this, Nick!
- It's done.

30:40.202 --> 30:43.694
From now on, you find
some other shamus to pester.

30:51.981 --> 30:54.779
Be right back.

30:56.485 --> 31:00.182
Nick's just tired and hurt.
He didn't mean it, Seymour.

31:00.256 --> 31:02.588
I think he did.

32:21.504 --> 32:23.438
Thank you.

32:26.242 --> 32:29.769
I already hurt one friend tonight.
I can't hurt two.

32:32.014 --> 32:35.950
Look, Seymour, you...

32:36.018 --> 32:40.352
you're not a nerd
or a wuss or a wimp...

32:40.422 --> 32:42.890
or any of the other names
that I called you.

32:42.958 --> 32:46.325
You're a neat kid
and a good friend.

32:46.395 --> 32:48.329
Thank you.

32:48.397 --> 32:53.494
The kind a guy can count on,
which is why I said what I did.

32:53.569 --> 32:55.503
I don't get it.

32:56.572 --> 32:58.904
I'm going after
Klapper tonight.

33:00.009 --> 33:02.534
I didn't want you
tagging along.

33:04.613 --> 33:06.547
You were afraid
I'd get hurt.

33:06.615 --> 33:08.549
Or in the way.

33:08.617 --> 33:11.313
Who is he, Nick?
I don't know.

33:11.387 --> 33:13.514
For a while,
I thought it was you.

33:13.589 --> 33:15.523
Me?
Yeah.

33:15.591 --> 33:17.525
You practically shoved me
into the elevator.

33:17.593 --> 33:21.586
And tonight when he tried to fog
me, you were flagging a canary.

33:21.664 --> 33:24.098
It could have been me, but it wasn't. Yeah.

33:24.166 --> 33:26.691
No, I realized that
in the cab.

33:26.769 --> 33:29.636
It was raining when Klapper
shot at me from the alley.

33:29.705 --> 33:31.832
If you were Klapper,
you would have been soaked.

33:31.907 --> 33:34.205
But you don't know who he is. I know where he is.

33:34.276 --> 33:37.439
And we're going after him.
No.

33:37.513 --> 33:39.572
I'm going after him.

33:39.648 --> 33:43.846
I could be an extra pair
of peepers, cover your seat.

33:43.919 --> 33:48.879
Nick, after what you said,
you owe it to me.

33:50.759 --> 33:53.125
Okay, kid,

33:53.195 --> 33:55.959
on two conditions.
Name 'em.

33:56.031 --> 33:58.226
One: You follow my orders
to the letter.

33:58.300 --> 34:00.234
And?

34:00.302 --> 34:02.327
Go get a raincoat
so you don't catch pneumonia.

34:02.404 --> 34:04.668
Gotcha!

34:08.677 --> 34:10.702
So long, Seymour.

34:24.960 --> 34:27.087
I thought you'd never get here.

34:43.545 --> 34:46.206
Just missed the cab, huh?

34:52.755 --> 34:56.623
I got it. You laid a Ben Franklin on
the cocktail shaker at the Blue Island,

34:56.692 --> 35:00.628
and he opened up like a pencil pusher
from Toledo on his third martini.

35:00.696 --> 35:03.722
I gave the bartender
at the club $100,

35:03.799 --> 35:07.200
and he started talking like an accountant
from Toledo who'd had one too many?

35:07.269 --> 35:09.760
- That's what I said.
- Oh, God, I understood you.

35:09.838 --> 35:12.238
- Am I right?
- No.

35:12.307 --> 35:15.105
Then how do you know Klapper's
taking Allison to La Guardia?

35:15.177 --> 35:17.975
- And not vice versa.
- Al.

35:18.047 --> 35:20.242
Al? Who's Al?

35:20.315 --> 35:23.011
A... A friend.
A real good friend.

35:23.085 --> 35:25.212
Well, let's not get mushy
about it.

35:25.287 --> 35:27.346
The one who tipped you
to the Klapper.

35:27.423 --> 35:29.687
Well, he tipped me about a lot
of things, and I wouldn't listen.

35:29.758 --> 35:32.989
Well, maybe I went
a little too far.

35:33.062 --> 35:36.657
I got angry and I said some
things that I regret.

35:36.732 --> 35:39.929
He's the other friend
you hurt tonight?

35:40.002 --> 35:42.095
What, you jumped
on the kid too?

35:43.305 --> 35:45.865
- I'm afraid so.
- Aw, Sam.

35:45.941 --> 35:48.409
I'll bet you didn't want
him to get hurt either.

35:48.477 --> 35:51.002
Hurt?

35:51.080 --> 35:53.878
Where are we going, Sam?

35:53.949 --> 35:56.850
- La Guardia.
- Yeah.

36:11.533 --> 36:16.027
Sam, uh, this is
very dangerous.

36:18.507 --> 36:22.443
- Allison's in there somewhere.
- That's why it's dangerous.

36:26.115 --> 36:28.208
It's a big bird roost, Nick.

36:28.283 --> 36:32.947
Yeah. All right, you take that end, I'll take
this one, and I'll meet you in the middle.

36:33.021 --> 36:35.990
- Gotcha!
- Seymour.

36:36.058 --> 36:41.724
Allison may have hired
Klapper to kill Phil.

36:41.797 --> 36:44.925
- Thanks.
- Nick, you can't think that.

36:45.000 --> 36:48.299
- Well, no, but,
- Oh, Sam.

36:48.370 --> 36:50.600
As long as
there's a possibility,

36:50.672 --> 36:53.266
if you eyeball
my main squeeze,

36:53.342 --> 36:56.402
Peeping Tom her
until you can semaphore me.

36:56.478 --> 36:59.845
"Main squeeze"?

36:59.915 --> 37:02.509
Allison.

37:02.584 --> 37:06.315
"Main squeeze. "
I gotta remember that one.

37:13.162 --> 37:17.462
What's wrong, Al? I thought you
were up on all this private eye lingo.

37:17.533 --> 37:21.264
I understood you.
I'm just wondering how in 20 years...

37:21.336 --> 37:25.739
"main squeeze" gets from
Seymour to black slang.

37:27.576 --> 37:30.511
I assume you're packing a roscoe.

37:30.579 --> 37:32.706
Yep.

37:32.781 --> 37:36.774
Would you use it on Allison
if you had to?

37:36.852 --> 37:39.047
Probably not.

37:39.121 --> 37:41.715
Great.

37:41.790 --> 37:45.282
Where you going? I’m going
to check the ladies' room.

37:45.360 --> 37:48.261
- Al!
- Somebody's gotta do it.

37:56.438 --> 37:59.168
Bogie! Don't point, Allen. It's not polite.

37:59.241 --> 38:02.369
But it's Humphrey Bogart.
Mr. Bogart. Mr. Bogart!

38:02.444 --> 38:05.277
- This can't be.
- Oh, it is you. I knew it!

38:05.347 --> 38:08.646
- Allen, leave the poor man alone.
- I've seen all your movies.

38:08.717 --> 38:13.177
Ever since I could curl my lip, I wanted
to be like you. I even dream you talk to me.

38:13.255 --> 38:16.156
You know, give me advice, like
how to get Annie up to my bedroom.

38:17.593 --> 38:20.585
Lionel, gee,
what are you doing here?

38:23.098 --> 38:25.032
Move.

38:25.100 --> 38:28.433
My analyst calls it neurotic.
Of course it's neurotic.

38:28.503 --> 38:30.596
If he lived with my mother,
he'd be neurotic too.

38:30.672 --> 38:33.505
She drives me bananas.

38:33.575 --> 38:35.509
Excuse me.

38:39.848 --> 38:41.782
- See what you did?
- I just wanted his autograph.

38:41.850 --> 38:44.250
You want an autograph?
Here's an autograph.

39:30.766 --> 39:32.893
Lionel, let him go.

39:35.037 --> 39:37.562
We don't wanna
hurt him, Nick.

39:37.639 --> 39:40.904
All Allison and I want
is out of New York.

39:40.976 --> 39:45.072
Nick won't let... Nick, you have to face reality.

39:45.147 --> 39:48.605
She doesn't love you
any more than she loved Phil.

39:48.684 --> 39:52.051
- Is that why you killed him?
- He wouldn't face the truth.

39:52.120 --> 39:55.851
We had no choice.
But you're smarter, Nick.

39:55.924 --> 39:57.949
Always were!

39:58.026 --> 40:00.756
Where's Allison?

40:00.829 --> 40:03.889
Seymour's dying, Nick!

40:03.966 --> 40:06.093
What's it gonna be?

40:22.050 --> 40:25.781
How many shots was that now
that he fired so far?

40:25.854 --> 40:27.879
- Get down, Al!
- Why?

40:27.956 --> 40:30.447
He can't see me
or hear me.

40:30.525 --> 40:34.154
You stay down.
I'll go find him for you.

40:34.229 --> 40:36.823
Al.

40:40.002 --> 40:42.368
There you are,
you sneaky devil.

40:44.706 --> 40:46.640
He's right over here, Sam.

40:51.079 --> 40:53.570
You couldn't hit an elephant
in a tunnel.

40:53.648 --> 40:55.639
Boy, are you in
for a big surprise.

40:55.717 --> 40:57.685
Sam, he doesn't know
where you are.

40:57.753 --> 40:59.846
He's gonna shoot,
now duck!

41:01.256 --> 41:07.058
Sam, go to the back of the hangar,
and then make your way toward me.

41:07.129 --> 41:10.565
Don't you ever clean your mustache?
You got gunk in there. It's yucky.

41:10.632 --> 41:12.691
Gonna shoot again!

41:12.768 --> 41:15.566
Ah! Now, Sam!

41:15.637 --> 41:20.097
He's out of bullets. He's loading
up. Get over here. Hurry Up!

41:20.175 --> 41:23.440
Sam, hurry! Where the hell are you, Sam?

41:27.015 --> 41:29.882
Don't even think about it,
you mug.

41:29.951 --> 41:33.910
Oh, no, Sam. Sam,
that's Edward G. Robinson.

41:52.674 --> 41:55.871
How could I have turned Lionel on
and not realized it?

41:58.814 --> 42:02.580
You know, the funny part is
I kind of feel sorry for him.

42:04.719 --> 42:06.653
Yeah, me too.

42:08.190 --> 42:10.556
Nick, take me away from this.

42:12.761 --> 42:15.889
My apartment?

42:15.964 --> 42:20.560
Actually, I was thinking
of someplace a little farther.

42:27.876 --> 42:30.140
Where'd you get those?

42:30.212 --> 42:34.615
Well, I know some people
might think it's a little bizarre,

42:34.683 --> 42:37.311
but the poor soul
did pay for them.

42:38.520 --> 42:40.454
Where are they to?

42:41.957 --> 42:43.982
Does it matter?

43:15.157 --> 43:18.923
You, uh,
you wanna board, Angel?

43:18.994 --> 43:21.519
I'll join you in a minute.

43:24.132 --> 43:26.965
Don't make me wait too long.

43:28.036 --> 43:30.163
It's a sleeper flight.

43:44.386 --> 43:48.117
I don't think
you can take that plane.

43:48.190 --> 43:52.058
Oh, Al.
I'm gonna get on that plane,

43:52.127 --> 43:54.459
'cause if I don't, I'm gonna
regret it for the rest of my life.

43:54.529 --> 43:56.463
Maybe not today,
maybe not tomorrow, but...

43:56.531 --> 43:59.830
No, no, I've seen
the picture, Sam.

43:59.901 --> 44:03.837
Oh, well, good.
Then you know how it ends.

44:26.428 --> 44:29.397
- Sam.
- What?

44:29.464 --> 44:33.696
I didn't say you didn't want to go with her.
I said I didn't think you could.

44:33.768 --> 44:36.464
- Who's gonna stop me?
- Nick!

44:37.539 --> 44:41.339
He tried to kill me,
to choke me to death.

44:41.409 --> 44:45.209
Don't you mean the loony tune tried
to fog me with a chicken throttle?

44:45.280 --> 44:47.475
Nick, this was for real.

44:47.549 --> 44:50.211
Isn't that what
you're looking for, Seymour?

44:50.285 --> 44:52.845
A chance to duke it out
with the Hard Harry’s...

44:52.921 --> 44:56.823
on a night as quiet as the
city morgue on a slow day.

44:56.891 --> 44:59.792
Maybe it would be more fun
to just read about it.

44:59.861 --> 45:03.797
Yeah, or write about it.

45:03.865 --> 45:07.426
Me?
Become a writer?

45:07.502 --> 45:09.868
Yeah, why not?
With your imagination...

45:09.938 --> 45:14.204
and flair for similes,
how could you miss?

45:14.276 --> 45:17.143
Nick?

45:17.212 --> 45:19.646
Hurry.

45:19.714 --> 45:21.648
Oh, boy.

45:25.620 --> 45:28.987
The fog was as thick
as hash house oatmeal...

45:29.057 --> 45:33.153
and twice as cold,
as her hips said good-bye.

45:33.228 --> 45:36.322
Maybe she was too much
moonlight and orchids for me,

45:36.398 --> 45:40.061
but I couldn't help wishing
that my daisy crunchers and hers...

45:40.135 --> 45:42.865
could be outside
the same hotel room door.

45:42.937 --> 45:46.464
You were here to launch
a new pulp novelist.

45:46.541 --> 45:49.442
No. No, no, no.

45:49.511 --> 45:52.241
Sam, I think...
Don't say it, Al.

45:52.314 --> 45:55.647
This is the start
of a wonderful friendship.

45:55.717 --> 45:57.651
You couldn't resist,
could you?

46:12.634 --> 46:15.569
You'd better hurry.
You'll be late for your new job,

46:15.637 --> 46:19.129
Miss Youngest Executive Secretary
at the company.

46:22.610 --> 46:24.703
"Miss"?
