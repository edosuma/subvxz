00:05.662 --> 00:07.962
****  S P O i L E R S ****

00:08.187 --> 00:14.687
With this episode CBC and Shaftesbury have given the shaft
to all of the major Sapphist characters in a single episode.

00:14.712 --> 00:20.753
Perhaps we won't watch anymore because
there are <i> NO </i>  Sapphists in the show.

00:20.779 --> 00:29.961
Until the1960s any sapphic or lesbian literature
had to see the sapphists come to a tragic demise.
Living 'happily ever after' was too obscene.

00:29.962 --> 00:31.962
End of
****  S P O i L E R S ****

00:53.787 --> 00:55.788
Good morning, Lillian.

00:55.790 --> 00:58.123
Last day as Dr. Grace.

00:58.125 --> 01:00.459
Just because I'll no longer
be Toronto's coroner doesn't

01:00.461 --> 01:02.895
mean I'll cease being a doctor.
Of course.

01:02.897 --> 01:04.897
How are you progressing
next door?

01:04.899 --> 01:07.666
My room is packed up. Only
some final errands to see to.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.668
Then could I trouble you
to pick up

01:09.670 --> 01:12.371
my dress from the seamstress?
Of course.

01:12.373 --> 01:14.406
To think in a only a few days

01:14.408 --> 01:16.875
we will be crossing the Atlantic
for London, England.

01:16.877 --> 01:20.212
I cannot wait.

01:20.214 --> 01:22.281
I love you.

01:27.253 --> 01:29.321
Good, good.

01:31.257 --> 01:33.525
Yes, we look forward
to having you, Dr. Slater.

01:33.527 --> 01:35.527
Have a safe journey.

01:35.529 --> 01:39.231
I said, "Have a safe journey,
Dr. Slater!"

01:39.233 --> 01:41.233
Yes, yes, you will need

01:41.235 --> 01:43.502
a substantial coat
for the winter...

01:43.504 --> 01:45.904
Oh, I'll have to cut you short.

01:45.906 --> 01:48.273
My detective's calling.
Sir, I can return.

01:50.710 --> 01:53.445
I will, I will...
Thank you, Doctor.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.447
(sigh)

01:55.449 --> 01:57.616
That was Dr. Peter Slater,

01:57.618 --> 01:59.718
our new coroner from Vancouver.
He's en route.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.720
I see.
Lovely man,

02:01.722 --> 02:04.590
but perhaps a bit...
A bit talkative, sir?

02:04.592 --> 02:07.092
Talkative? He's got
more bloody rabbit

02:07.094 --> 02:10.129
than all of Margaret's female
relatives put together, Murdoch.

02:10.131 --> 02:12.998
He comes highly recommended
and he is very experienced.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
He's deaf as a doornail

02:15.002 --> 02:17.402
and he's worried his arthritis
will flare up in the cold.

02:17.404 --> 02:19.404
I do wish Dr. Grace
would stay on.

02:19.406 --> 02:22.274
Yes, well, she's made
her mind up, Murdoch.

02:22.276 --> 02:24.643
Perhaps it's
for the best, anyway.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.645
How do you mean?
Sirs.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.881
There's been a shooting.

02:33.920 --> 02:37.089
Sirs. No witnesses.

02:37.091 --> 02:39.291
(woman): Right here is fine.

02:39.293 --> 02:42.161
She's here.
Thank you, Worsley.

02:42.163 --> 02:44.596
Good day, Inspector. A fresh

02:44.598 --> 02:46.598
corpse and a crime scene,
what more could one ask for?

02:46.600 --> 02:48.600
I'll get someone else
to attend the body.

02:48.602 --> 02:51.003
I'm not yet in London.
Besides, I'm rather glad

02:51.005 --> 02:53.772
that my last day has offered
some excitement.

02:53.774 --> 02:56.475
Let me do my job, Inspector.
I can't.

02:56.477 --> 02:59.678
(laughing): Why?

03:01.681 --> 03:05.350
(sad music)
(inaudible words)

03:26.773 --> 03:30.275
Does anyone come to mind who
may have wished Miss Moss harm?

03:30.277 --> 03:33.612
Not specifically.
What about

03:33.614 --> 03:36.815
friends? Family?

03:36.817 --> 03:40.419
She attended
an embroidery group.

03:40.421 --> 03:43.655
I never went but she said
she had friends there.

03:43.657 --> 03:46.124
She never talked about
her family. I took it to be

03:46.126 --> 03:48.260
a sore spot. I...

03:48.262 --> 03:50.262
I did meet her uncle once.

03:50.264 --> 03:53.599
Yes, Lillian arranged for me
to meet him last year.

03:53.601 --> 03:56.301
He was sympathetic
to our campaign.

03:56.303 --> 03:58.370
Wayland Porter, I believe.

03:58.372 --> 04:00.772
I know him.
He's a fellow Mason.

04:00.774 --> 04:03.141
Right.
Henry.

04:03.143 --> 04:05.143
Anything interesting
from Miss Moss's room?

04:05.145 --> 04:08.347
I found her appointment book.
I've found this key. I think

04:08.349 --> 04:10.249
it might be
a safety deposit box.

04:10.251 --> 04:13.085
Can you think of anything
else, Dr. Grace?

04:13.087 --> 04:15.354
No I... We were packed

04:15.356 --> 04:17.522
for London, she was excited...

04:17.524 --> 04:19.591
Emily, I'm so sorry--

04:24.264 --> 04:26.265
Sorry to hear about
your friend, Dr. Grace.

04:26.267 --> 04:28.934
Terribly sorry, Emily.
Thank you both.

04:28.936 --> 04:31.169
Will you still go to London?

04:31.171 --> 04:33.538
Ah...
Henry. I'm sure Dr. Grace

04:33.540 --> 04:35.607
has plenty to think about
without worrying about that.

04:38.378 --> 04:41.079
<i>I can't decide which to take.</i>

04:41.081 --> 04:43.181
Then bring both of them.

04:43.183 --> 04:46.418
We're starting anew, Emily. We
should only take what we must.

04:46.420 --> 04:49.254
(sigh)
I prefer that one.

04:49.256 --> 04:51.256
You were wearing it
when we first met.

04:51.258 --> 04:53.892
Oh, was I now?
Mm-hmm.

04:53.894 --> 04:57.329
And not only will you bring it,

04:57.331 --> 04:59.831
but you will wear it
on the boat for me.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.767
Or else?

05:01.769 --> 05:04.870
You wouldn't dare to find out.

05:04.872 --> 05:06.872
<i>Emily.</i>

05:06.874 --> 05:09.541
Are you alright?

05:15.248 --> 05:17.716
George, look at this.

05:17.718 --> 05:20.385
It was in her date book.

05:20.387 --> 05:23.055
"Morris Kerr,
Private Investigator."

05:23.057 --> 05:25.057
Maybe Miss Moss
was looking for someone.

05:27.760 --> 05:30.962
Thank you for
seeing me, Wayland.
What can I do for you, Tom?

05:30.964 --> 05:33.565
Your niece, Lillian Moss...

05:33.567 --> 05:36.468
I'm sorry to tell you

05:36.470 --> 05:38.537
that she's been murdered.

05:41.207 --> 05:43.809
We had just said our goodbyes
prior to London...

05:45.745 --> 05:47.679
Do you know who did it?
I was hoping you could

05:47.681 --> 05:50.549
put me in contact
with her family.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.784
I don't know her family.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.786
But you're her uncle.

05:54.788 --> 05:57.222
Well, I'm not actually
her uncle.

05:57.224 --> 05:59.224
Not by blood, at least.

05:59.226 --> 06:01.460
Then what are you to her?

06:01.462 --> 06:03.495
Merely a friend, Tom.

06:03.497 --> 06:06.064
I'm sorry I can't be
of more help.

06:08.434 --> 06:10.736
A single .38 calibre

06:10.738 --> 06:12.938
between the sixth
and seventh true ribs.

06:12.940 --> 06:16.208
Given the presence of gunpowder
residue I would say she was shot

06:16.210 --> 06:18.910
at close range.
So this wasn't a random act.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.912
She was deliberately targeted.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.914
It would appear.

06:22.916 --> 06:26.284
William, I received more
than a few angry letters

06:26.286 --> 06:29.621
during the election.
I imagine Lillian did too.

06:29.623 --> 06:31.823
Why didn't you tell me?

06:31.825 --> 06:35.394
I knew our campaign would
result in rancour,

06:35.396 --> 06:38.196
but I guess I didn't take
the threats as seriously

06:38.198 --> 06:41.166
as I should have.
Julia, if you could

06:41.168 --> 06:43.402
send along those letters
when you have a moment?

06:54.580 --> 06:57.482
I want to see her, Julia.

07:11.664 --> 07:15.300
Funny, if we had gone to London
four months ago

07:15.302 --> 07:17.702
when she wanted to, none
of this would have happened...

07:17.704 --> 07:21.706
There's nothing you
could have done.

07:21.708 --> 07:23.909
-...Instead she waited for me.
She was targeted.

07:27.747 --> 07:30.515
If this was related
to our suffrage efforts--

07:30.517 --> 07:32.651
I should have just left
when she asked.

07:35.855 --> 07:38.523
Emily,

07:38.525 --> 07:41.026
I know what Lillian
meant to you.

07:43.563 --> 07:47.032
The Inspector told you?
He's the only one who knows.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.967
Women's intuition.

07:48.969 --> 07:52.404
What about the others?
George? The Detective?

07:52.406 --> 07:55.474
No. At least not by my lips.

07:58.110 --> 08:00.111
Lillian Moss may
have hired this man

08:00.113 --> 08:02.314
as a private investigator.
His name is Morris Kerr.

08:02.316 --> 08:04.449
And what did Mr. Kerr
have to say?

08:04.451 --> 08:07.018
Nothing, sir. He appears
to have vanished.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.454
Now, I did gain entry to his
office and I confiscated

08:09.456 --> 08:11.957
all his files. But there
doesn't appear to be one

08:11.959 --> 08:14.259
for Lillian Moss, nor does
she appear as a client

08:14.261 --> 08:16.628
in his receipt ledger.
And what about the key

08:16.630 --> 08:18.763
we found in Miss Moss's room?
Were you able to find

08:18.765 --> 08:20.765
the safety deposit box for that?

08:20.767 --> 08:23.134
Not yet, sir. Were you
able to glean anything

08:23.136 --> 08:25.804
from the letters Dr. Ogden
received during the election?

08:25.806 --> 08:29.474
They appear to be
empty threats. Thank you.

08:29.476 --> 08:32.110
Sir.

08:32.112 --> 08:35.113
Dr. Grace.
I just wanted to apologize

08:35.115 --> 08:37.315
for my abruptness earlier.

08:37.317 --> 08:40.752
It's not necessary. You lost
somebody close. I understand.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.457
Any progress with the case?
Not worth mentioning,

08:45.459 --> 08:47.459
but we're working diligently.

08:47.461 --> 08:50.829
You don't happen to know where
Lillian did her banking, do you?

08:50.831 --> 08:52.797
The Imperial, I believe.

08:52.799 --> 08:56.034
I think she may have
had a safety deposit box.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.103
We will get to the bottom
of this, Emily.

09:07.246 --> 09:09.281
<i>I've just received a letter</i>
<i>from a close friend</i>

09:09.283 --> 09:11.283
<i>of mine in London, England.</i>

09:11.285 --> 09:13.485
A friend of hers,
Mrs. Pankhurst,

09:13.487 --> 09:16.021
is forming a suffragette union
and she's just put out a call

09:16.023 --> 09:19.157
for international supporters.
Oh, that's wonderful.

09:19.159 --> 09:21.860
Going there to join them could
be the adventure of a lifetime.

09:21.862 --> 09:24.930
Going there?
Together.

09:43.215 --> 09:45.283
Emily.

09:48.754 --> 09:51.189
When Lillian

09:51.191 --> 09:53.892
first brought up the idea
of moving to London,

09:57.163 --> 09:59.197
she said that a friend
had written

09:59.199 --> 10:01.232
encouraging us to join

10:01.234 --> 10:03.802
Mrs. Pankhurst's
suffrage movement.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.870
Yes, I recall you telling me.

10:05.872 --> 10:07.872
Yes, but in fact

10:07.874 --> 10:10.909
Lillian wrote to her first.

10:13.813 --> 10:17.382
Her friend didn't even respond
until three weeks later.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.620
You shouldn't think
anything of it, Emily.

10:21.622 --> 10:24.723
Perhaps there's a missing letter
explaining the discrepancy--

10:24.725 --> 10:26.758
No, look at the date, Julia.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.794
Lillian wrote the initial letter

10:29.796 --> 10:31.796
only after

10:31.798 --> 10:35.000
she brought up the prospect
of London with me.

10:35.002 --> 10:37.369
And not only that, her friend
replied saying that

10:37.371 --> 10:39.738
Mrs. Pankhurst suggested

10:39.740 --> 10:41.740
that we remain here in Toronto

10:41.742 --> 10:44.776
to continue the cause here.

10:44.778 --> 10:48.146
I suppose she was very
keen to go to London.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.448
It's an understandable desire.

10:50.450 --> 10:54.052
Yes, but why would
she lie to me?

10:54.054 --> 10:56.221
She made up a story
and then tried

10:56.223 --> 10:58.757
to make the letters
match it after the fact.

10:58.759 --> 11:01.393
Why did she lie, Julia?

11:15.107 --> 11:17.409
So far we don't know
much about anything.

11:17.411 --> 11:19.811
No witnesses to the shooting,
no known enemies,

11:19.813 --> 11:21.913
and an uncle that's
not even a bloody uncle.

11:21.915 --> 11:24.816
And she had the business card
of a private investigator

11:24.818 --> 11:27.419
who is now missing, Morris Kerr.
Do we know the connection

11:27.421 --> 11:29.587
to the missing sleuth yet?
There's no indication

11:29.589 --> 11:32.223
that he was looking for her,
or that she had hired him

11:32.225 --> 11:35.860
to look for someone else.
Sirs, I have something.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.996
Lillian Moss had
a safety deposit box

11:37.998 --> 11:40.832
at the Imperial bank.
I found this.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.934
It's $400 in cash.

11:42.936 --> 11:46.538
That's a tidy sum for a young
girl to squirrel away.

11:46.540 --> 11:49.874
And I know who gave it to her.

11:49.876 --> 11:52.277
<i>This is your seal, is it not?</i>

11:52.279 --> 11:54.979
Yes.
Mr. Porter, this money

11:54.981 --> 11:57.649
was found in Miss Moss's
safety deposit box.

11:57.651 --> 12:00.418
Why did you give it to her?
She seemed desperate.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.387
I just wanted to help.

12:02.389 --> 12:05.023
How did you know one another?

12:05.025 --> 12:08.493
Well, we traveled
in similar circles.

12:08.495 --> 12:11.496
Perhaps you were paying
her for favours.

12:11.498 --> 12:14.132
Favours a man such
as yourself could afford,

12:14.134 --> 12:17.168
and that ladies such as
Miss Moss could offer.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.370
Perhaps.
Bollocks.

12:19.372 --> 12:22.240
Lillian Moss wasn't
that type of girl.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.409
She was a sapphist.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.911
A devoted one at that.

12:26.913 --> 12:30.482
You say you traveled
in similar circles.

12:30.484 --> 12:33.184
Perhaps if Miss Moss's desires

12:33.186 --> 12:35.653
were unconventional,
yours are as well?

12:35.655 --> 12:40.291
It won't go beyond this
office, Wayland. You
have my word.

12:43.863 --> 12:46.364
Having Lillian on my arm
at the right events

12:46.366 --> 12:49.033
kept such rumours at bay.

12:49.035 --> 12:51.936
But that's not what
the money was for.

12:51.938 --> 12:54.839
I don't know why she needed it,
only that she did.

12:54.841 --> 12:58.676
We had become good friends
and I just wanted to help.

12:58.678 --> 13:00.745
Do you recall when
you gave it to her?

13:00.747 --> 13:03.047
Around four months ago.

13:03.049 --> 13:05.917
We attended a Christmas
gala that evening.

13:05.919 --> 13:08.019
December 10th, I would say.

13:08.021 --> 13:11.589
Thank you, Mr. Porter.

13:15.728 --> 13:19.097
Tom, the Masons--
I said, you have my word.

13:23.836 --> 13:26.437
Sir. How did you know
that about Miss Moss?

13:28.374 --> 13:30.441
A lucky guess.

13:34.313 --> 13:37.081
December 10th.
Christmas ball at the

13:37.083 --> 13:40.285
Queen's Hotel with Mr. Porter.
And the next day?

13:43.222 --> 13:46.224
It just says "Chartwell Pond."
Nothing else.

13:46.226 --> 13:48.226
Ah, Dr. Grace, thank you
for coming in.

13:48.228 --> 13:50.228
I hope I can be of some help.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.564
Doctor, please have a seat.

13:57.303 --> 13:59.737
Doctor, approximately
four months ago,

13:59.739 --> 14:04.509
Miss Moss was in
desperate need of $400.

14:04.511 --> 14:07.545
Do you have any idea why?

14:07.547 --> 14:10.114
No,

14:10.116 --> 14:13.852
although she was quite anxious
around that time,

14:13.854 --> 14:16.521
which would coincide with her
pressing me to go to London.

14:16.523 --> 14:19.324
but that urgency seemed to pass.
Sounds like

14:19.326 --> 14:22.260
the money was to get you two
across the Atlantic.

14:22.262 --> 14:24.429
No, I never asked
for her to pay my way,

14:24.431 --> 14:26.698
nor was I even willing
to go right then.

14:26.700 --> 14:30.335
Borrowing money for London
would have been premature.
Unless she planned

14:30.337 --> 14:32.270
to travel without you
and then changed her mind.

14:32.272 --> 14:35.073
She wouldn't have done that.

14:37.543 --> 14:41.045
Doctor, were you aware that
Miss Moss was a sapphist?

14:41.047 --> 14:43.348
Yes, I was aware.

14:43.350 --> 14:46.651
Murdoch, why don't you look
into this Chartwell business?

14:46.653 --> 14:49.454
Sir. Why did you not tell us?

14:49.456 --> 14:51.456
It could be pertinent
to the investigation--

14:51.458 --> 14:53.391
I don't see how it is,
Detective.

14:53.393 --> 14:56.227
Well. A victim's
lover is often the
first person we speak to.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.897
Then I suppose you would
want to speak to me.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.735
Is there anything you
would like to ask me

15:03.737 --> 15:05.803
that you haven't already?

15:11.243 --> 15:14.145
I...

15:14.147 --> 15:16.014
Thank you for
your candour, Doctor.

15:16.016 --> 15:18.683
George.

15:18.685 --> 15:22.453
Chartwell Pond.
(sigh)

15:27.860 --> 15:30.061
I imagine that's
a weight off, Doctor.

15:30.063 --> 15:33.264
I suppose so.

15:40.306 --> 15:42.640
(door opening)

16:05.331 --> 16:07.865
May I help you?

16:07.867 --> 16:10.635
Oh, uh, pardon me.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.704
I wasn't expecting anyone.

16:15.207 --> 16:19.243
Who are you?
Daniel Miles. I just moved in.

16:19.245 --> 16:22.013
They rented the room already?

16:22.015 --> 16:25.616
I was told it was vacant.
It is.

16:25.618 --> 16:28.553
It is. My friend used
to live here.

16:28.555 --> 16:31.322
I live next door.
Oh.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.358
Well, very nice to
meet you, Miss...

16:33.360 --> 16:36.127
Emily Grace. And welcome.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.751
(door opening)
<i>This is so exciting.</i>

16:59.753 --> 17:02.553
Transatlantic passage to London

17:02.555 --> 17:04.889
for a Dr. Grace
and a Miss Moss

17:04.891 --> 17:06.891
on the RMS Carpathia.

17:06.893 --> 17:09.293
One might think us a wealthy
doctor and his mistress

17:09.295 --> 17:12.163
when you say it that way.
(laughing)

17:12.165 --> 17:15.033
Running off to start
a new life together.

17:45.130 --> 17:48.466
I wonder what Lillian Moss
was doing in a place like this?

17:48.468 --> 17:50.902
In the dead of winter, no less.

17:50.904 --> 17:54.539
The human heart certainly
is a mystery, isn't it, sir?

17:54.541 --> 17:56.541
Indeed.

17:56.543 --> 17:58.543
All that time I spent
with Dr. Grace,

17:58.545 --> 18:00.678
I never would have guessed.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.347
We don't have to
discuss it, George, if...

18:03.349 --> 18:05.383
I don't mind.

18:05.385 --> 18:09.187
I just, I would hate to think
I did something wrong.

18:09.189 --> 18:11.622
I mean, what could Lillian
possibly have to offer

18:11.624 --> 18:15.326
that I do not? Or you know what
I mean, any man for that matter?

18:15.328 --> 18:17.695
I really wouldn't know,
George.

18:17.697 --> 18:20.064
I suppose men do tend to be

18:20.066 --> 18:22.400
brutish, uncouth creatures.

18:22.402 --> 18:25.503
As where women tend to be

18:25.505 --> 18:28.005
refined, caring.

18:28.007 --> 18:31.275
They certainly smell better.
Yes.

18:31.277 --> 18:33.511
In fact, if you think of it
in those terms it's a wonder

18:33.513 --> 18:35.913
all women don't choose
to be with other women.

18:35.915 --> 18:39.050
Well for one, George,
we would perish as a species.

18:39.052 --> 18:42.353
Unless, sir, in the future
we devise a way

18:42.355 --> 18:45.289
to procreate without the man,
without the man actually
having to put--

18:45.291 --> 18:47.925
I really don't think
that's possible, George.

18:49.962 --> 18:53.564
Sir. Look here.

18:53.566 --> 18:56.100
A boot.

18:56.102 --> 18:59.070
I suppose there's
any number of ways

18:59.072 --> 19:01.072
a boot could have gotten here.

19:01.074 --> 19:03.007
It's an awful weight
though, sir.

19:03.009 --> 19:05.076
The foot's still in it.

19:18.323 --> 19:20.324
Do the police know
who's responsible?

19:20.326 --> 19:22.393
Not yet, I'm afraid.

19:24.329 --> 19:27.265
Miss Elms, may I ask
how you knew Lillian?

19:27.267 --> 19:30.268
We became friends through
our embroidery group.

19:30.270 --> 19:33.838
She helped me through
a difficult time. And you?

19:33.840 --> 19:36.607
We both worked together
on an election campaign

19:36.609 --> 19:39.410
last year for Margaret Haile.
Oh yes,

19:39.412 --> 19:42.213
I do recall Lillian appealing
to our group for support.

19:45.884 --> 19:49.120
I should give you some privacy
to open her letter.

19:49.122 --> 19:52.423
Stay. You must be curious.

19:52.425 --> 19:55.259
It's a wonder you didn't
open it yourself.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.368
I'd never been
to Toronto Island.

20:04.370 --> 20:06.370
Lillian took me there
for the day.

20:06.372 --> 20:10.675
When was that taken?
Quite recently.

20:13.011 --> 20:16.447
You two must have been very
close. I'm sorry for your loss.

20:16.449 --> 20:18.683
My condolences to you as well.

20:29.194 --> 20:32.964
As you can see, George,
the boot has water damage.

20:32.966 --> 20:34.966
So it's been in there
some time, then?

20:34.968 --> 20:37.435
When a body decomposes,
the extremities

20:37.437 --> 20:40.171
usually detach first.
It was likely dragged off

20:40.173 --> 20:43.307
by an animal of some sort.
Sir, the smell is unbearable--

20:43.309 --> 20:45.476
(man): We found something!
Right here!

20:45.478 --> 20:47.545
Sounds like they've found
something, sir.

20:52.050 --> 20:54.118
My God.

20:58.423 --> 21:00.491
Good job, Lutz.

21:03.228 --> 21:05.796
There's a calling card, sir.

21:05.798 --> 21:08.366
Look who it is.

21:08.368 --> 21:10.434
"Morris Kerr."

21:10.436 --> 21:13.838
Our private investigator.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.374
Mr. Kerr was struck fatally
on the head. Perhaps with a rock

21:16.376 --> 21:18.376
or a club of some sort.

21:18.378 --> 21:20.378
When did he die?

21:20.380 --> 21:22.380
I'd say four or five
months ago would be

21:22.382 --> 21:24.715
a fair estimate.

21:24.717 --> 21:27.184
Her datebook places her
at the scene of the crime

21:27.186 --> 21:29.854
around the time that Mr. Kerr
is said to have perished.

21:29.856 --> 21:32.757
That coincides with her
wanting to leave Toronto.

21:34.693 --> 21:39.196
Do you think Lillian killed him,
Detective?

21:41.199 --> 21:43.701
There's a strong possibility.

21:50.709 --> 21:52.777
<i>Have a look at this, George.</i>

21:54.713 --> 21:58.282
That's her, Henry.
That's Lillian Moss.

21:58.284 --> 22:00.751
But it's filed under

22:00.753 --> 22:02.953
"Miss Helen Walker,"

22:02.955 --> 22:04.989
868 Jarvis Street.

22:04.991 --> 22:08.025
I'll let the Detective know.

22:12.898 --> 22:16.667
This is it, sir. 868
Jarvis Street.
(knocking)

22:19.638 --> 22:21.639
You again.

22:21.641 --> 22:23.708
Mr. Porter, we found
your address

22:23.710 --> 22:27.111
in a private investigator's file
linked to Lillian Moss.

22:27.113 --> 22:30.114
Well, Miss Moss did live here
for a short time.

22:30.116 --> 22:32.450
Why didn't you bloody
mention that before?

22:32.452 --> 22:35.252
How long ago?
About a year ago.

22:35.254 --> 22:38.289
She was new to Toronto
and needed somewhere to stay.

22:38.291 --> 22:40.124
Do you know where
she lived prior to that?

22:40.126 --> 22:42.126
No. She never said.

22:42.128 --> 22:44.128
Do you know Helen Walker?

22:44.130 --> 22:46.764
No... but that name
is familiar.

22:46.766 --> 22:48.866
How so?
Several months ago

22:48.868 --> 22:52.803
a man came here looking for
a Helen Walker from Port Credit.

22:52.805 --> 22:55.005
He came by twice, in fact.

22:57.209 --> 23:01.379
Is this him? Morris Kerr.
Yes, I believe it is.

23:01.381 --> 23:03.881
(quietly): You know
what this means?

23:03.883 --> 23:07.618
Helen Walker and Lillian Moss
could be one and the same.

23:16.228 --> 23:19.864
Helen Walker?
You had no indication

23:19.866 --> 23:23.200
Miss Moss was living under
an assumed name?
Of course not.

23:23.202 --> 23:25.336
But then, we don't know
anything about her before

23:25.338 --> 23:28.339
she arrived in Toronto.
The 1901 census confirms
there was a Helen Walker

23:28.341 --> 23:30.341
in Port Credit at that time.

23:30.343 --> 23:33.310
Included is an address
and a date of birth.

23:33.312 --> 23:36.614
February 17th, 1877?

23:41.720 --> 23:44.655
We're taking a trip to Port
Credit, me ol' mucker.

23:47.793 --> 23:50.194
I fell for her
without meaning to.

23:52.330 --> 23:55.699
Just because she wasn't
who she said she was,

23:55.701 --> 23:57.701
that doesn't mean that

23:57.703 --> 24:00.471
what you had with her

24:00.473 --> 24:02.406
wasn't genuine...

24:02.408 --> 24:05.042
what you fell for wasn't real.

24:07.112 --> 24:09.113
(whispering):
I'm afraid I've lost sight

24:09.115 --> 24:11.182
of what was real
and what wasn't.

24:24.062 --> 24:26.330
Miss Walker had been
renting my coach house here

24:26.332 --> 24:29.300
on the property until
just over a year ago.

24:29.302 --> 24:32.870
This Helen Walker?
Yes, that's her.

24:32.872 --> 24:35.473
What sort of trouble
is she in now?

24:35.475 --> 24:39.076
Well, she's been murdered.
Oh. Well that's fitting.

24:39.078 --> 24:41.078
What do you mean by that?

24:41.080 --> 24:44.114
Whatever ills befell her
were earned twice over.

24:44.116 --> 24:46.116
Get to the point.

24:46.118 --> 24:49.453
She seduced my sister
into a perverted relationship.

24:49.455 --> 24:52.156
When Gladys came to her senses
and tried to end it,

24:52.158 --> 24:55.426
Helen Walker killed her,
along with her husband, Joe.

24:55.428 --> 24:57.795
Was this investigated?
Constable

24:57.797 --> 25:01.065
Conroy could barely be
bothered to look into it.

25:01.067 --> 25:03.167
But I know what she did.

25:06.938 --> 25:09.874
Bit different
to Yorkshire, Murdoch.

25:09.876 --> 25:12.243
I imagine it is.

25:12.245 --> 25:15.412
Mr. Horsely belongs
in the asylum.

25:15.414 --> 25:18.182
You can't believe
a word he says.

25:18.184 --> 25:20.351
Tell us what happened,
Constable Conroy.

25:20.353 --> 25:23.420
Miss Walker, along with
Joe and Gladys Holler,

25:23.422 --> 25:26.524
took their boat out for a sail.
The weather turned ugly,

25:26.526 --> 25:29.627
they lost control and hit
a rock, puncturing the hull.

25:29.629 --> 25:31.795
They went overboard.
Joe and Gladys

25:31.797 --> 25:33.797
perished,
Helen made it to shore.

25:33.799 --> 25:36.867
Mr. Horsely contends
that you were negligent

25:36.869 --> 25:38.869
in your investigation.
Joe Holler

25:38.871 --> 25:40.871
was a childhood friend.

25:40.873 --> 25:43.574
I was every bit as eager to
solve the case as Mr. Horsely,

25:43.576 --> 25:45.576
but there was no case to solve.

25:45.578 --> 25:48.646
It was an accident. One of many
we have each summer here.

25:48.648 --> 25:52.483
Yet two people died and
the third changed her identity

25:52.485 --> 25:56.387
and fled town.
You can appreciate why
Mr. Horsely is suspicious.

25:56.389 --> 25:58.522
Her leaving town
and assuming a new name

25:58.524 --> 26:01.859
can be explained quite simply --
Nicholas Horsely.

26:01.861 --> 26:04.295
Go on.
He harassed her in the ensuing

26:04.297 --> 26:06.497
days. Even threatened
to kill her.

26:06.499 --> 26:08.732
Can we see the report?

26:08.734 --> 26:11.402
This includes Helen Walker's
account of the events.

26:15.073 --> 26:17.541
Where's the rest?
As I said,

26:17.543 --> 26:21.178
it was cut and dried
as far as I was concerned.

26:21.180 --> 26:23.981
Look at this. Ideal sailing
conditions. Ideal!

26:23.983 --> 26:26.750
And I'm to believe that
Helen swam back to shore

26:26.752 --> 26:29.820
but not Gladys or Joe? It's
ridiculous! She killed them!

26:29.822 --> 26:32.856
Did you present this evidence
to Constable Conroy?

26:32.858 --> 26:35.426
Repeatedly.
"Case closed," he says.

26:35.428 --> 26:37.461
Where are you leading us,
Mr. Horsely?

26:37.463 --> 26:39.663
You said you wished you could
see the boat, Detective Murdoch.

26:39.665 --> 26:41.665
Well,

26:41.667 --> 26:45.269
this is what I was able
to salvage from the Gladys.

26:45.271 --> 26:47.605
The Gladys?
Named after my sister

26:47.607 --> 26:51.008
by our father. Pieces of her
started drifting ashore

26:51.010 --> 26:53.577
weeks later, a mile
down the coast.

26:53.579 --> 26:57.381
Constable Conroy said
this boat hit a rock and sank.

26:57.383 --> 26:59.383
That's right.

26:59.385 --> 27:02.553
But these slats are broken
in the opposite direction. Here,

27:02.555 --> 27:06.790
here, and here. The hull was

27:06.792 --> 27:10.828
punctured from the inside,
not the outside.

27:10.830 --> 27:13.831
I knew it.
After Helen killed them

27:13.833 --> 27:16.166
she scuttled the ship and set it

27:16.168 --> 27:18.168
adrift to sink far away.

27:18.170 --> 27:21.038
That doesn't necessarily prove
that she killed them.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.807
Actually sir, it might.

27:23.809 --> 27:27.311
There's blood on this sailcloth.

27:27.313 --> 27:29.446
I'm terribly sorry
about this, Dr. Grace,

27:29.448 --> 27:32.316
but Lillian may have murdered

27:32.318 --> 27:34.551
two people in Port Credit
last year.

27:34.553 --> 27:38.222
She was in a relationship
with a married woman
named Gladys Holler.

27:38.224 --> 27:41.225
When Mrs. Holler had enough
of the tryst, she tried
to put a stop to it.

27:41.227 --> 27:44.828
According to Mrs. Holler's
brother, a Nicholas Horsely,

27:44.830 --> 27:47.431
Lillian didn't take well
to being abandoned.

27:47.433 --> 27:50.334
So she contrived
a final boat trip

27:50.336 --> 27:53.737
and murdered Gladys
and her husband, Joe Holler.

27:53.739 --> 27:56.607
After she'd done the deed,
she rolled the bodies overboard.

27:56.609 --> 27:59.410
She then scuttled the boat,
swam to shore, and reported

27:59.412 --> 28:01.345
the incident to the police
as an accident.

28:01.347 --> 28:03.914
Are you sure, William?
Fatal boat accidents

28:03.916 --> 28:07.084
happen frequently.
There was no poor
weather that day.

28:07.086 --> 28:10.120
The lake was perfectly calm.

28:10.122 --> 28:12.589
The blood was found
on the sailcloth.

28:12.591 --> 28:14.191
And the wood splintered
in the opposite--

28:14.193 --> 28:16.727
It's fine, Detective.
I believe you.

28:16.729 --> 28:19.196
I'd rather not hear anymore.

28:19.198 --> 28:21.498
Emily.

28:21.500 --> 28:24.368
I was about to upset my entire
life to be with a murderer.

28:24.370 --> 28:26.370
There's nothing
you could've done.

28:26.372 --> 28:28.372
What confuses me is that
I still love her, even though

28:28.374 --> 28:30.441
I so badly want to hate her.

28:38.450 --> 28:40.317
<i>Sirs.</i>

28:40.319 --> 28:43.520
I've found a correspondence
between our man in Port Credit,

28:43.522 --> 28:45.522
Nicholas Horsely,
and the private investigator.

28:45.524 --> 28:48.459
He hired Morris Kerr
to track down Helen Walker,

28:48.461 --> 28:50.461
Lillian Moss as we knew her.

28:50.463 --> 28:52.830
He was convinced from the
start that Miss Moss murdered

28:52.832 --> 28:54.832
his sister and brother-in-law.

28:54.834 --> 28:58.035
And since the police
weren't doing anything, he
took matters into his own hands.

28:58.037 --> 29:01.238
We know that Horsely
threatened to kill her
before she fled to Toronto.

29:01.240 --> 29:04.041
We also know the private
investigator found Miss Moss.

29:04.043 --> 29:06.410
In that case, Horsely would
have known of her assumed

29:06.412 --> 29:08.579
identity. It would have been
easy enough to track her down.

29:08.581 --> 29:10.881
And sirs,

29:10.883 --> 29:13.517
Horsely's secretary puts
him in Toronto on business

29:13.519 --> 29:15.619
the day of the murder.

29:15.621 --> 29:18.155
We need another trip
to Port Credit, Murdoch.

29:21.059 --> 29:24.061
Well, I suppose I should be
relieved this is coming
to a close.

29:24.063 --> 29:26.130
As am I, Emily.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.968
Your presence has brought
me much comfort

29:30.970 --> 29:33.670
these last few days.

29:33.672 --> 29:36.707
Thank you.

29:36.709 --> 29:39.543
I should tell Lillian's friend
we've found her killer.

29:39.545 --> 29:41.612
Yes, of course.

29:43.848 --> 29:46.150
We know you hired
private investigator

29:46.152 --> 29:48.619
Morris Kerr to locate her.
Yes, I hired him,

29:48.621 --> 29:50.954
but I never found out where
Helen was. Mr. Kerr stopped

29:50.956 --> 29:54.291
returning my calls months ago!
He took my money and vanished!

29:54.293 --> 29:57.094
We also know that you
were in Toronto on Tuesday,

29:57.096 --> 29:59.997
the day Miss Moss was murdered.
We spoke to your secretary.

29:59.999 --> 30:02.833
She said you were there looking
at your factory that day.

30:02.835 --> 30:05.536
Not true!
I sent my assistant that day.

30:05.538 --> 30:07.871
Mr. Horsely.

30:07.873 --> 30:10.808
If you weren't in Toronto, as
you claim, then where were you?

30:10.810 --> 30:13.777
Here in Port Credit,
at the local police station,

30:13.779 --> 30:15.979
trying to convince
Constable Conroy

30:15.981 --> 30:19.049
to look at the evidence again.

30:19.051 --> 30:21.785
Miss Elms? It's Emily Grace.

30:21.787 --> 30:23.787
I have some news for you
about Lillian.

30:23.789 --> 30:26.290
May I visit?

30:26.292 --> 30:28.692
See you shortly.

30:32.463 --> 30:34.665
Sorry to intrude, Miss Grace.
I couldn't help but hear

30:34.667 --> 30:36.667
that you were in the hall.

30:36.669 --> 30:39.303
How can I help you, Mr. Miles?
Your friend forgot this.

30:39.305 --> 30:42.172
It had fallen behind the
dresser. Not sure if it means

30:42.174 --> 30:44.575
anything to you.

30:44.577 --> 30:48.378
It does. Thank you.

30:51.583 --> 30:53.884
(Murdoch): And you're certain
Nicholas Horsely

30:53.886 --> 30:56.753
was here Tuesday morning?
Harassing me to re-open

30:56.755 --> 30:59.256
the Holler case, of course.

30:59.258 --> 31:02.359
He wasn't in Toronto the day
Miss Moss was killed.

31:02.361 --> 31:04.528
Sorry to disappoint you,
gentlemen.

31:04.530 --> 31:06.530
Explain to me
how some crackpot

31:06.532 --> 31:09.499
comes nearer to solving
a double murder than a copper?

31:09.501 --> 31:11.702
I take great offense
to any suggestion of negligence.

31:11.704 --> 31:13.704
Joe Holler was
a lifelong friend.

31:13.706 --> 31:16.373
Nobody would want to see his
murder avenged more than me.

31:16.375 --> 31:19.076
Constable, you've now
provided us with

31:19.078 --> 31:21.545
your very own motive
for wanting Miss Walker dead.

31:21.547 --> 31:24.181
I was here the morning she
was murdered in Toronto,

31:24.183 --> 31:26.850
Horsely told you so himself.
The boat accident

31:26.852 --> 31:29.353
was a terrible tragedy
and I'll forever regret

31:29.355 --> 31:31.388
that I was not able
to recover the body.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.390
"Body"?

31:33.392 --> 31:35.392
Excuse me?

31:35.394 --> 31:37.494
You said "recover the body."
Singular.

31:37.496 --> 31:40.297
Yet by your own account
there were two victims.

31:40.299 --> 31:42.532
Are you now saying
there was only one?

31:42.534 --> 31:44.534
An innocent slip
of the tongue.

31:44.536 --> 31:46.470
Perhaps not so innocent.
Constable,

31:46.472 --> 31:49.039
did either Gladys
or Joe Holler survive?

31:49.041 --> 31:52.476
No.
Stop right there, Constable.

31:52.478 --> 31:55.412
You're lying.
You've been lying all along.

31:55.414 --> 31:58.148
What are you hiding?
Constable.

31:58.150 --> 32:01.018
You failed to investigate.
You ignored key evidence,

32:01.020 --> 32:03.921
which I'm certain your superiors
would be very interested in.

32:03.923 --> 32:06.523
Now I suggest you tell us
what happened.

32:10.128 --> 32:13.430
We believe a man
named Nicholas Horsely

32:13.432 --> 32:16.400
killed Lillian.

32:16.402 --> 32:20.037
He was the brother
of Gladys Holler,

32:20.039 --> 32:23.006
one of her victims.

32:23.008 --> 32:25.909
Are you certain?

32:25.911 --> 32:28.512
The police are in Port Credit
arresting him as we speak.

32:34.953 --> 32:37.788
I thought the news would
bring you some relief.

32:37.790 --> 32:41.758
We can finally put all
of this behind us.

32:41.760 --> 32:43.927
It's just all been
so overwhelming.

32:43.929 --> 32:45.996
Will you please excuse me
for a moment?

33:32.176 --> 33:34.177
George.

33:34.179 --> 33:37.447
Nicholas Horsely is not
Miss Moss's killer.

33:37.449 --> 33:39.483
The real killer could still
be living in Toronto

33:39.485 --> 33:42.786
under an assumed name.
Take this down...

33:42.788 --> 33:44.788
Right.

33:44.790 --> 33:48.425
I'll have a look through Morris
Kerr's files and see what
I can find, sir.

33:48.427 --> 33:51.728
You're Gladys Holler.

33:55.066 --> 33:58.568
You two were lovers. You've been
lying to me this entire time.

33:58.570 --> 34:00.670
Yes.

34:03.741 --> 34:06.877
What happened on that boat?
It no longer matters.

34:06.879 --> 34:08.945
It very much does.
What happened?

34:21.092 --> 34:23.326
My husband Joe insisted
the three of us

34:23.328 --> 34:25.328
go for a sail.

34:25.330 --> 34:27.964
What Helen and I didn't realize
is that he had discovered

34:27.966 --> 34:30.067
we were lovers.

34:30.069 --> 34:33.804
But after a couple of drinks
I fell asleep.

34:33.806 --> 34:37.541
I awoke to a scream.
(choking sounds)

34:37.543 --> 34:41.078
(Joe grunting)
<i>Joe was strangling Helen.</i>

34:41.080 --> 34:45.415
(gasping)
<i>He was in a rage.</i>

34:45.417 --> 34:49.886
You killed him.
I picked up an oar.

34:51.823 --> 34:53.824
<i>And from behind I...</i>

34:53.826 --> 34:55.792
<i>broke Joe's head open.</i>

34:59.330 --> 35:01.331
<i>I watched him bleed,</i>

35:04.702 --> 35:07.504
<i>face down on my boat.</i>

35:09.907 --> 35:12.742
That monster...
He was still breathing,

35:12.744 --> 35:15.579
but not for long.

35:15.581 --> 35:18.982
Helen and I rolled
the body overboard.

35:21.018 --> 35:23.120
You saved her.

35:23.122 --> 35:25.956
And she saved me.

35:25.958 --> 35:28.892
We knew the police wouldn't
believe what really happened.

35:28.894 --> 35:31.695
Helen convinced me to disappear.

35:31.697 --> 35:33.997
She then staged
the boat accident

35:33.999 --> 35:36.399
and told the police
I'd died too.

35:36.401 --> 35:39.703
I was to start
a new life elsewhere.

35:39.705 --> 35:43.039
We were never to see
each other again.

35:44.976 --> 35:47.444
But I couldn't stay
away from her.

35:47.446 --> 35:49.713
I had to see her.

35:51.649 --> 35:54.985
You found her in Toronto
and resumed the relationship.

35:54.987 --> 35:57.053
No.

35:59.323 --> 36:01.258
Because of you.

36:01.260 --> 36:03.627
She didn't look at me

36:03.629 --> 36:05.929
the same way she used to.

36:05.931 --> 36:08.932
You killed her.

36:08.934 --> 36:12.702
No.
You found out that we
were going to London, and if--

36:12.704 --> 36:14.738
if you couldn't have her
no one else could.

36:14.740 --> 36:17.908
I'm not lying to you anymore.

36:17.910 --> 36:20.844
I'm so very lost, Emily.

36:20.846 --> 36:24.147
(knocking)

36:31.789 --> 36:34.257
Oh, my God... Emily.

36:39.263 --> 36:41.331
(knocking)

36:43.501 --> 36:45.602
Hello, Gladys.

36:45.604 --> 36:47.704
Joe...

36:47.706 --> 36:50.674
You're alive.
How could you leave me

36:50.676 --> 36:53.577
for dead like that?
You killed Helen.

36:53.579 --> 36:56.479
It was all her fault, Gladys.
She seduced you.

36:56.481 --> 36:58.515
Tried to break us apart.

36:58.517 --> 37:01.084
You're going to kill me too.
No, Gladys.

37:01.086 --> 37:04.187
I'm here to take you back.
To start over again.

37:04.189 --> 37:06.256
I'm going to make you my wife
again, without Helen

37:06.258 --> 37:08.258
to get in the way.
You're a monster.

37:08.260 --> 37:10.260
I want nothing to do with you--
You don't have a say

37:10.262 --> 37:12.329
in the matter. I'm taking you

37:12.331 --> 37:14.464
and I will do
with you as I wish.

37:14.466 --> 37:17.000
You're my wife, Gladys.

37:17.002 --> 37:19.569
But first you'll tell me
where your new lady friend is.

37:19.571 --> 37:22.939
I don't know who you
are talking about.
Don't lie to me!

37:22.941 --> 37:24.941
Where is Miss Grace?

37:24.943 --> 37:26.843
I know she's here.
It's how I found you.

37:26.845 --> 37:29.212
I followed her.
She's gone.

37:29.214 --> 37:33.350
(cries)

37:33.352 --> 37:35.385
Why did you make me do that?

37:35.387 --> 37:37.387
Please leave me, Joe.

37:37.389 --> 37:40.090
(grunts)

37:44.395 --> 37:47.564
Tell me what you
did to Lillian.
Do it, Emily.

37:47.566 --> 37:51.368
Tell me! Now!

37:51.370 --> 37:53.870
I'd been looking for
her a long time.

37:53.872 --> 37:57.941
I didn't need anyone else
knowing I was alive.

37:57.943 --> 38:00.977
And your Lillian,

38:00.979 --> 38:03.813
or whatever she
was calling herself,

38:03.815 --> 38:06.182
sure was surprised
when I found her.

38:08.786 --> 38:11.688
Hello, Helen.

38:11.690 --> 38:14.257
I thought you were dead.

38:19.630 --> 38:21.631
(gasp)
Where's Gladys?

38:24.969 --> 38:28.405
Leave us be, Joe.
Leave us all be.

38:28.407 --> 38:33.243
Where is my wife?

38:33.245 --> 38:35.679
Suit yourself.

38:37.581 --> 38:40.650
I'll find her.
(gun cocking)

38:40.652 --> 38:43.153
(gunshot)
(gasp)

38:53.164 --> 38:55.632
<i>Dr. Grace!</i>

38:57.568 --> 39:00.070
Emily. Give me the gun.

39:00.072 --> 39:02.339
He killed Lillian.

39:02.341 --> 39:04.708
Emily,

39:04.710 --> 39:06.710
don't take the law
into your own hands.

39:06.712 --> 39:08.778
Take it from me, it's a mistake.

39:10.748 --> 39:13.583
Please, Emily, give me the gun.

39:15.553 --> 39:18.221
Emily, it's alright.

39:18.223 --> 39:20.290
Emily.

39:27.131 --> 39:29.265
You're under arrest.

39:29.267 --> 39:31.334
(man groans)

39:46.317 --> 39:48.885
To England.
Yes. To England.

39:48.887 --> 39:51.654
Cheers.
Cheers.

39:51.656 --> 39:54.624
Change will do you good, Doctor.

39:54.626 --> 39:56.860
It's what Lillian
would have wanted.

39:56.862 --> 39:58.862
It's what I want.

39:58.864 --> 40:01.398
Sorry to intrude. I've put
a call through for you, sir.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.566
It's urgent.
Oh, right.

40:03.568 --> 40:06.536
Well, if this takes some time,

40:06.538 --> 40:09.406
please remember:
your heart will mend.

40:09.408 --> 40:12.409
Good luck.
Thank you, Inspector.

40:14.779 --> 40:18.114
You know, I've always
wanted to visit London.

40:22.052 --> 40:24.754
Take care, Dr. Grace.
Thank you.

40:27.224 --> 40:30.860
London, England. I must say
I'm somewhat jealous.

40:30.862 --> 40:33.997
Perhaps you'll find
occasion to visit.

40:33.999 --> 40:36.566
I would very much like that.

40:41.472 --> 40:43.740
Doctor.

40:45.843 --> 40:48.511
You made me better at my job,
Detective.

40:48.513 --> 40:52.315
I can say the same about you.

40:59.323 --> 41:02.459
Well... goodbye.

41:02.461 --> 41:04.461
Good luck.
Good luck.

41:10.301 --> 41:12.302
We have a spot
of bother, Murdoch.

41:12.304 --> 41:14.137
What's that?
We have a body on the way.

41:14.139 --> 41:16.706
When does Dr. Slater arrive?

41:16.708 --> 41:19.242
It is Dr. Slater. The old
codger kicked the bucket

41:19.244 --> 41:21.478
on the train.
Oh, my.

41:24.315 --> 41:27.217
It would appear we are in need
of a coroner, then.

41:32.556 --> 41:34.624
What?

41:38.329 --> 41:40.330
Would you like to drive?

41:40.332 --> 41:42.398
I would rather
you did, George.

41:47.538 --> 41:49.606
Next stop, Union Station.

42:04.522 --> 42:07.123
So I suppose this is it.

42:07.125 --> 42:09.192
I suppose it is.

42:11.629 --> 42:13.696
Thank you.

42:24.909 --> 42:26.976
You have to let go, Emily.

42:26.978 --> 42:29.345
But what if
I don't want to, George?

42:29.347 --> 42:32.115
What if...

42:32.117 --> 42:34.317
what if this is a mistake?

42:34.319 --> 42:37.220
Well, that's what you
need to find out.

42:37.222 --> 42:39.622
Alright?

42:45.195 --> 42:47.430
Goodbye, George Crabtree.

42:50.568 --> 42:52.969
Goodbye, Emily Grace.

With this episode CBC and Shaftesbury have given the shaft
to all of the major Sapphist characters in a single episode.

43:44.118 --> 43:46.021
Perhaps we won't watch anymore because there are<i> NO </i>  Sapphists.
We are       #Anti-homophobic
CBC is            #Heterosaturated
