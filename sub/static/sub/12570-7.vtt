00:05.334 --> 00:06.813
What do you

00:06.814 --> 00:08.292
think is in here?

00:05.334 --> 00:08.292
LUKE: I don't know,

00:08.334 --> 00:09.627
but whatever it is,

00:09.628 --> 00:10.918
I'm guessing it's about

00:08.334 --> 00:10.918
to throw up.

00:12.667 --> 00:14.251
Am I wrong, or is Zuri

00:14.252 --> 00:15.834
really pushing her luck

00:12.667 --> 00:15.834
with Santa?

00:18.083 --> 00:19.355
Make sure to hang

00:19.356 --> 00:20.626
that one on

00:18.083 --> 00:20.626
a sturdy hook.

00:20.667 --> 00:22.292
Coal is very heavy.

00:24.334 --> 00:25.688
I can't believe you

00:25.689 --> 00:27.042
invited up two

00:24.334 --> 00:27.042
complete strangers

00:27.083 --> 00:28.626
from off the street.

00:28.667 --> 00:30.417
No good can come of that.

00:30.459 --> 00:32.000
- That's how
- I wound up living here.

00:32.083 --> 00:33.292
Exactly.

00:35.292 --> 00:37.250
Hey, it's Christmas Eve!

00:37.292 --> 00:38.709
- Quit being
- such a scrooge!

00:39.083 --> 00:41.000
- So, what did you get
- the kids for Christmas?

00:41.375 --> 00:42.813
I don't know.

00:42.814 --> 00:44.250
I just put my name on

00:41.375 --> 00:44.250
all the gifts you got 'em.

00:45.417 --> 00:46.894
- Just for that, - you are going to
- Help me

00:46.918 --> 00:48.718
- Set up a Christmas
- treasure hunt for them.

00:48.918 --> 00:50.064
(SCOFFS) How am I

00:50.065 --> 00:51.209
supposed to put my

00:48.918 --> 00:51.209
name on that?

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Hey, guys!

00:59.375 --> 01:00.501
Hello, Jessie.

01:00.502 --> 01:01.626
Hi, everyone.

00:59.375 --> 01:01.626
This is my brother, PJ.

01:01.667 --> 01:03.292
Hey.

01:03.334 --> 01:05.059
- JESSIE: This is Ravi, Emma - and
Luke. Welcome - To our humble home.

01:05.083 --> 01:06.876
I guess in New York,

01:06.877 --> 01:08.667
"humble" means palace

01:05.083 --> 01:08.667
towering over the city.

01:09.834 --> 01:10.939
My parents say thanks

01:10.940 --> 01:12.042
again for letting

01:09.834 --> 01:12.042
us stay here.

01:12.083 --> 01:13.355
We feel really bad

01:13.356 --> 01:14.626
intruding on your

01:12.083 --> 01:14.626
Christmas Eve.

01:15.042 --> 01:16.938
Aw, oh, well,

01:16.939 --> 01:18.834
we wouldn't want you

01:15.042 --> 01:18.834
to feel bad.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.459
Ignore our butler.

01:24.500 --> 01:25.522
Hospitality is not

01:25.523 --> 01:26.542
really his thing.

01:27.334 --> 01:28.500
- How odd.
- (CHUCKLES)

01:28.542 --> 01:29.585
Do you also have a chef

01:29.586 --> 01:30.626
who hates to cook?

01:30.667 --> 01:32.417
Yeah. Same guy.

01:34.083 --> 01:35.313
The kids were actually

01:35.314 --> 01:36.542
just about to open their

01:34.083 --> 01:36.542
Christmas Eve gifts.

01:36.584 --> 01:38.059
- Has everyone - picked out
- A present?

01:38.083 --> 01:39.355
Well, I have now.

about flossing.

03:26.792 --> 03:28.459
- We've all dreamed
- about you flossing.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.591
- Watch out, watch out,
- watch out, watch out.

03:31.667 --> 03:33.000
Ow! Ow! Ow!

03:34.083 --> 03:35.083
Yeah!

03:38.209 --> 03:40.083
- What happened
- to our tree?

03:40.584 --> 03:41.731
And why am I

03:41.732 --> 03:42.876
the only thing

03:40.584 --> 03:42.876
under it?

03:44.125 --> 03:45.500
OMG!

03:45.542 --> 03:47.042
- All our presents
- are gone!

03:47.083 --> 03:48.334
That's weird.

03:48.375 --> 03:49.709
I've never heard

03:49.710 --> 03:51.042
of Santa taking

03:48.375 --> 03:51.042
away presents!

03:51.083 --> 03:52.542
- How naughty
- were you two?

03:54.125 --> 03:55.500
Guys!

03:57.083 --> 03:58.563
Remember that

03:58.564 --> 04:00.042
cool chemistry set

03:57.083 --> 04:00.042
I opened up last night?

04:00.083 --> 04:02.000
- ALL: No.
- Nerd.

04:03.959 --> 04:05.042
Neither do I.

04:05.083 --> 04:06.876
- But I woke up
- a few minutes ago,

04:06.918 --> 04:08.792
- And I made some
- troubling discoveries.

04:09.083 --> 04:11.059
- Actually, I don't - remember anything
- That happened last

04:11.083 --> 04:12.626
- Night after Teddy
- and PJ got here.

04:12.667 --> 04:13.772
Yeah, the last thing

04:13.773 --> 04:14.876
I remember is

04:15.083 --> 04:16.625
- Freckles here
- hitting on me.

04:17.918 --> 04:19.334
And my last memory

04:19.336 --> 04:20.750
is you saying you'd go

04:17.918 --> 04:20.750
out with me.

04:22.083 --> 04:23.209
Worth a try.

04:24.709 --> 04:26.500
- Why can't any of us
- remember last night?

04:27.083 --> 04:28.959
- Judging from my notes,
- it appears

04:29.000 --> 04:30.042
I mixed a compound

04:30.083 --> 04:31.355
which exploded

04:31.356 --> 04:32.626
into a toxic vapor,

04:32.667 --> 04:34.355
that put us to sleep

04:34.356 --> 04:36.042
and caused a retroactive

04:32.667 --> 04:36.042
memory blackout.

04:37.042 --> 04:38.268
- Sincerest apologies
- from myself

04:38.292 --> 04:40.125
- And the Little Edison
- Toy Company.

04:41.626 --> 04:42.834
Okay, um, not to add

04:42.835 --> 04:44.042
another problem

04:41.626 --> 04:44.042
to the list,

04:44.083 --> 04:45.444
- but has anyone
- seen my brother?

04:46.042 --> 04:47.584
(PJ SCREAMS)

04:47.626 --> 04:49.000
- No, but do you
- have a sister?

04:52.250 --> 04:54.042
- It's in there!
- It's, it's big,

04:54.083 --> 04:55.397
It's scary,

04:55.398 --> 04:56.709
and when I woke up,

04:54.083 --> 04:56.709
it was nibbling on me!

04:57.042 --> 04:58.083
- The lizard?
- The butler?

04:59.125 --> 05:00.209
(GROWLING)

05:01.083 --> 05:02.147
Wow, whoa,

05:02.148 --> 05:03.209
it's a reindeer!

05:03.250 --> 05:04.751
- I thought it was
- a moose.

05:07.959 --> 05:09.000
Nice reindeer.

05:10.042 --> 05:11.059
- Please tell me
- you're on a break

05:11.083 --> 05:12.724
- And Santa's on his way
- to pick you up!

05:16.083 --> 05:18.000
- Yes, Dad, - we're having
- A great Christmas.

05:18.042 --> 05:19.834
- They even have - a reindeer.
- (CHUCKLES)

05:20.751 --> 05:21.897
Right, uh, yeah,

05:21.898 --> 05:23.042
of course,

05:20.751 --> 05:23.042
a, a plastic one.

05:23.083 --> 05:24.563
A real one would be

05:24.564 --> 05:26.042
bizarre and frightening.

05:27.751 --> 05:28.897
Good boy, Prancer.

05:28.898 --> 05:30.042
More like Biter.

05:31.167 --> 05:32.209
Or Kicker.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.522
We looked everywhere,

05:36.523 --> 05:38.042
but we could not find

05:35.000 --> 05:38.042
any presents.

05:38.083 --> 05:39.125
- Not even socks.
- (SOBS)

05:41.792 --> 05:43.001
At this point,

05:43.002 --> 05:44.209
I'd be happy with an

05:41.792 --> 05:44.209
acrylic sweater.

05:45.042 --> 05:46.105
Santa,

05:46.106 --> 05:47.167
if you're listening,

05:45.042 --> 05:47.167
I didn't mean that!

05:48.209 --> 05:49.667
Okay, we need to

05:49.668 --> 05:51.125
figure this out before

05:48.209 --> 05:51.125
your parents get home.

05:51.167 --> 05:52.367
- We'll split into
- two teams.

05:53.709 --> 05:55.101
- Boys, you sift through - the wreckage for
- Anything that might

05:55.125 --> 05:56.168
Help us remember

05:56.169 --> 05:57.209
what happened

05:55.125 --> 05:57.209
last night.

05:57.250 --> 05:59.021
And, as we sift,

05:59.022 --> 06:00.792
we will also dust

05:57.250 --> 06:00.792
and put away!

06:01.125 --> 06:03.083
- I seriously need
- to change teams.

06:04.876 --> 06:05.959
PJ, you're in charge.

06:06.083 --> 06:07.292
Really? Cool!

06:09.083 --> 06:10.250
Ravi, you're in charge.

06:13.083 --> 06:14.542
Ugh! I can't believe

06:14.584 --> 06:15.792
I have to clean up

06:15.793 --> 06:17.000
your stupid chemistry set

06:14.584 --> 06:17.000
on Christmas.

06:17.125 --> 06:18.604
Stop crying over

06:18.605 --> 06:20.083
spilled magnesium

06:17.125 --> 06:20.083
citrate,

06:20.125 --> 06:21.584
and help us find

06:21.585 --> 06:23.042
some clues about what

06:20.125 --> 06:23.042
happened last night!

06:23.083 --> 06:24.393
- Hey, guys, - I think I found
- Our first clue!

06:24.417 --> 06:25.792
- Why do you
- say that?

06:25.834 --> 06:26.877
Because this paper says,

06:26.878 --> 06:27.918
"Your first clue."

06:28.209 --> 06:30.000
- Ooh!
- Dibs on reading it!

06:32.083 --> 06:34.042
- "Welcome to your
- Christmas treasure hunt."

06:34.083 --> 06:36.000
- What a whimsical
- holiday treat.

06:38.083 --> 06:39.105
"Sure, it is fun

06:39.106 --> 06:40.125
to just get a present,

06:40.167 --> 06:41.251
"but hunting for it is

06:41.252 --> 06:42.334
much more pleasant."

06:43.083 --> 06:44.204
- Someone hid
- our presents?

06:45.083 --> 06:47.000
- What kind of sicko
- would do that?

06:55.042 --> 06:56.435
- Okay, Sean's heading
- for the restroom,

06:56.459 --> 06:58.059
- So we've got about
- five minutes to check

06:58.083 --> 06:59.042
- Last night's
- security footage.

06:59.083 --> 07:00.188
He had Taco Queen

07:00.189 --> 07:01.292
for breakfast.

07:02.083 --> 07:03.209
We've got at least 20.

07:05.083 --> 07:06.185
- We need to figure out
- what happened

07:06.209 --> 07:08.167
- After you and PJ
- got here last night.

07:08.500 --> 07:09.668
Yeah, and who let

07:09.669 --> 07:10.834
a reindeer up unannounced.

07:11.167 --> 07:12.709
If you knew our door staff,

07:12.710 --> 07:14.250
you wouldn't be

07:11.167 --> 07:14.250
surprised by that.

07:15.083 --> 07:16.563
Just keep looking

07:16.564 --> 07:18.042
for the monster who

07:15.083 --> 07:18.042
stole our presents!

07:18.125 --> 07:19.709
Okay, no reindeer

07:19.710 --> 07:21.292
or monsters yet.

07:23.125 --> 07:25.000
- (CHUCKLES)
- That's a giant elf.

07:27.083 --> 07:28.876
- That's no elf,
- that's our butler!

07:29.083 --> 07:31.042
It was Bertram?

07:31.043 --> 07:33.000
I always knew

07:29.083 --> 07:33.000
he was part Grinch!

07:34.083 --> 07:36.042
- He's stealing presents
- from children?

07:36.083 --> 07:37.188
It does not get

07:37.189 --> 07:38.292
any lower than that.

07:38.876 --> 07:39.876
Whoa, it looks

07:39.877 --> 07:40.876
like he didn't

07:38.876 --> 07:40.876
act alone.

07:41.500 --> 07:42.918
Jessie?

07:44.250 --> 07:45.834
Uh...

07:45.876 --> 07:47.001
Okay, maybe not

07:47.002 --> 07:48.125
the lowest.

07:48.375 --> 07:50.167
- It's not like
- anybody died.

07:51.459 --> 07:53.125
- We haven't seen
- the rest of the tape.

07:55.083 --> 07:56.667
It was you?

07:56.668 --> 07:58.250
You stole our presents?

07:59.125 --> 08:00.480
(STAMMERING)

08:00.481 --> 08:01.834
I don't know why I would...

08:02.250 --> 08:03.250
Oh!

08:03.959 --> 08:05.292
Now I remember!

08:05.334 --> 08:06.730
I wanted to give you

08:06.731 --> 08:08.125
guys a Christmas

08:05.334 --> 08:08.125
treasure hunt,

08:08.167 --> 08:10.042
- so I hid all
- your presents.

08:10.083 --> 08:11.459
Sounds fun, right?

08:13.417 --> 08:14.480
Not as fun as finding

08:14.481 --> 08:15.542
them under the tree!

08:15.584 --> 08:17.292
And opening them

08:17.293 --> 08:19.000
in our jammies,

08:15.584 --> 08:19.000
as Santa intended!

08:20.125 --> 08:22.250
Okay, guys, relax.

08:22.292 --> 08:24.042
- We'll just go
- get the presents.

08:24.083 --> 08:25.876
- Great,
- where are they?

08:26.167 --> 08:27.375
I have no idea.

08:28.459 --> 08:29.897
Oh, someone's about to

08:29.898 --> 08:31.334
get Jack Frosted up!

08:32.082 --> 08:33.333
(GRUNTING)

08:33.583 --> 08:34.751
Why didn't you just hide

08:34.753 --> 08:35.918
them in the apartment?

08:35.958 --> 08:37.500
- Yeah, that would
- have been smarter.

08:38.583 --> 08:40.042
Okay, who invited her?

08:45.918 --> 08:47.209
Let me at her!

08:48.042 --> 08:49.667
- Zuri, aren't you
- the same girl

08:49.709 --> 08:51.063
Who was just on

08:51.064 --> 08:52.417
the subway yesterday

08:49.709 --> 08:52.417
preaching peace on Earth?

08:52.459 --> 08:53.792
All I know is,

08:53.793 --> 08:55.125
I don't have

08:52.459 --> 08:55.125
my presents,

08:55.167 --> 08:57.125
- so I need something
- to rip open!

08:57.167 --> 08:58.417
(GRUNTING)

08:58.959 --> 09:00.459
- Okay, guys,
- calm down!

09:00.500 --> 09:02.059
- Let's just empty - our pockets
- And purses

09:02.083 --> 09:03.126
And see if anything

09:03.127 --> 09:04.167
jogs my memory.

09:06.292 --> 09:07.585
Nope.

09:07.586 --> 09:08.876
All I have is

09:08.918 --> 09:10.334
- my emergency
- change of jewelry.

09:11.959 --> 09:13.719
- All I've got is - my walking around
- Cash.

09:16.083 --> 09:17.501
Well, um,

09:17.502 --> 09:18.918
I've got nothing,

09:18.959 --> 09:20.085
but dibs on checking

09:20.086 --> 09:21.209
your couch cushions!

09:22.542 --> 09:24.250
Okay, ball of lint,

09:24.292 --> 09:25.668
certificate for

09:25.669 --> 09:27.042
a full-body eucalyptus

09:24.292 --> 09:27.042
wrap,

09:27.083 --> 09:28.209
and a receipt for

09:28.210 --> 09:29.334
a locker rental

09:27.083 --> 09:29.334
in Central Park.

09:30.083 --> 09:31.105
I gave you that

09:31.106 --> 09:32.125
certificate months ago!

09:32.167 --> 09:34.000
- You're a thief
- and ungrateful!

09:34.459 --> 09:35.835
Well, excuse me

09:35.836 --> 09:37.209
for not wanting to

09:34.459 --> 09:37.209
spend five hours

09:37.250 --> 09:39.167
- just to smell like
- a koala snack!

09:39.209 --> 09:40.626
Wait, this receipt

09:40.627 --> 09:42.042
is dated December 24th

09:42.083 --> 09:43.563
for locker number

09:43.564 --> 09:45.042
three-three-nine

09:42.083 --> 09:45.042
at the skating rink.

09:45.083 --> 09:46.101
- Maybe I put
- the presents in there!

09:46.125 --> 09:47.125
Then what are we

09:47.126 --> 09:48.126
doing here? Let's go!

09:52.209 --> 09:54.167
Um, guys, uh, we're

09:54.168 --> 09:56.125
not taking the reindeer

09:52.209 --> 09:56.125
with us, right?

09:56.167 --> 09:57.667
Of course not,

09:57.709 --> 09:59.229
- that would be silly.
- (DOOR CLOSING)

09:59.626 --> 10:00.959
Sean, would you

10:00.960 --> 10:02.292
mind watching our dog?

10:04.334 --> 10:05.584
Bye, Spot.

10:05.626 --> 10:07.083
(GROWLING)

10:10.209 --> 10:11.209
I think he bought it.

10:14.209 --> 10:16.083
- Oh, there is
- the twelfth clue!

10:18.209 --> 10:19.209
All right.

10:20.500 --> 10:21.772
"Now you have come

10:21.773 --> 10:23.042
to the glorious stage

10:23.083 --> 10:25.284
- "Where the answer - is found in
- The reptile's cage."

10:26.125 --> 10:27.292
Oh, reptile!

10:27.334 --> 10:29.042
- This one's easy.
- RAVI: Wait!

10:29.083 --> 10:30.560
- Mrs. Kipling does not
- like strangers in her...

10:30.584 --> 10:32.125
- (ROARING)
- (PJ SCREAMS)

10:32.167 --> 10:33.459
cage.

10:37.042 --> 10:38.334
- (PANTING)
- I got... I got it!

10:39.083 --> 10:40.167
Ooh.

10:40.209 --> 10:41.667
- Wow, there's,
- there is a lot of

10:41.709 --> 10:42.855
Unexpected wildlife

10:42.856 --> 10:44.000
in this apartment.

10:46.375 --> 10:48.209
Okay, final clue,

10:48.250 --> 10:50.209
- "Don't rush off,
- stop and think.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.647
"Your presents are

10:51.648 --> 10:53.042
in a box by the rink."

10:53.584 --> 10:54.855
It must mean

10:54.856 --> 10:56.125
the ice skating rink

10:53.584 --> 10:56.125
in Central Park.

10:56.167 --> 10:57.083
- Yes! Ravi,
- you're brilliant!

10:57.125 --> 10:58.459
- Let's go!
- Oh...

10:59.083 --> 11:01.584
Uh, on the way,

11:01.626 --> 11:03.313
can we stop

11:03.314 --> 11:05.000
and pick up a tourniquet

11:01.626 --> 11:05.000
and a pint of O-negative?

11:09.167 --> 11:10.314
Here it is!

11:10.315 --> 11:11.459
Locker three-three-nine!

11:11.500 --> 11:13.125
- Okay, I have
- the combination.

11:14.167 --> 11:15.355
(BEEPING)

11:15.356 --> 11:16.542
"Balance due,

11:14.167 --> 11:16.542
twenty-five cents?"

11:16.584 --> 11:18.083
- Does anyone
- have a quarter?

11:18.125 --> 11:19.209
Here, I have one.

11:19.250 --> 11:20.292
Oh.

11:22.209 --> 11:23.375
- (BEEPING)
- Okay...

11:24.459 --> 11:26.125
- (GRUNTS)
- (GASPS) Bertram!

11:26.500 --> 11:28.042
- What are you
- doing in there?

11:28.083 --> 11:29.355
Trying to keep my elbow

11:29.356 --> 11:30.626
out of my gall bladder!

11:32.167 --> 11:33.685
- Jessie, last night
- you were supposed to come

11:33.709 --> 11:35.209
- Right back for me!
- Why didn't you?

11:35.751 --> 11:36.876
Uh, I have no idea!

11:36.918 --> 11:38.560
- None of us have
- any memory of last night.

11:38.584 --> 11:40.334
- (SCOFFS)
- Must be nice!

11:40.375 --> 11:42.042
- I've spent
- the entire night

11:42.083 --> 11:43.209
Wedged inside

11:43.210 --> 11:44.334
this stinky locker!

11:44.709 --> 11:46.584
- I'll never be able to
- go to the gym again.

11:46.834 --> 11:48.042
Again?

11:49.584 --> 11:51.334
Don't you even start!

11:52.375 --> 11:54.125
- Wait, why are you
- trapped in there?

11:55.083 --> 11:56.083
Aw, Oh, did Santa

11:56.084 --> 11:57.084
give you a time-out?

11:57.751 --> 11:59.209
(ALL GIGGLE)

11:59.250 --> 12:01.167
- Jessie, this is
- all your fault.

12:03.500 --> 12:05.334
- The kids were
- asleep when we left,

12:05.375 --> 12:06.938
So I don't understand

12:06.939 --> 12:08.500
why we had to wear

12:05.375 --> 12:08.500
these stupid costumes.

12:09.125 --> 12:10.272
I just wanted to see

12:10.273 --> 12:11.417
if you'd actually

12:09.125 --> 12:11.417
put it on.

12:11.459 --> 12:12.751
(LAUGHING)

12:13.209 --> 12:15.167
- Now I have next
- year's Christmas card!

12:16.125 --> 12:17.396
All right.

12:17.397 --> 12:18.667
Come on,

12:16.125 --> 12:18.667
let's go home.

12:20.083 --> 12:21.209
- JESSIE: Uh-oh,
- it's Zuri!

12:21.250 --> 12:23.125
- What is she doing
- not in bed?

12:23.167 --> 12:24.730
Why don't you

12:24.731 --> 12:26.292
ask her nanny?

12:23.167 --> 12:26.292
Oh, right.

12:26.542 --> 12:28.167
Just hide!

12:28.209 --> 12:30.101
- (STUTTERS) I don't want my -
Christmas surprise to - Get spoiled.

12:30.125 --> 12:31.805
- Where? - In there!
- There! There, there!

12:33.209 --> 12:34.480
Go, go, go!

12:34.481 --> 12:35.751
(GRUNTING)

12:37.083 --> 12:38.500
- Come on,
- move farther back!

12:38.542 --> 12:39.709
I can't!

12:39.751 --> 12:41.542
- What do you think - is back here,
- Narnia?

12:47.125 --> 12:48.584
I know Jessie

12:48.585 --> 12:50.042
and Bertram are

12:47.125 --> 12:50.042
here somewhere.

12:50.083 --> 12:51.105
I saw them sneak out

12:51.106 --> 12:52.125
with all the presents!

12:52.584 --> 12:53.709
Okay, we've been

12:53.710 --> 12:54.834
wandering around so long,

12:54.876 --> 12:55.938
I am starting to

12:55.939 --> 12:57.000
recognize all the rats.

12:59.292 --> 13:00.480
Can we please

13:00.481 --> 13:01.667
go back home?

12:59.292 --> 13:01.667
Hey.

13:02.083 --> 13:03.667
I don't know how

13:03.668 --> 13:05.250
you roll in that

13:02.083 --> 13:05.250
podunk hill town,

13:05.292 --> 13:06.646
but here in New York,

13:06.647 --> 13:08.000
we get what's ours.

13:08.375 --> 13:09.938
Okay, Denver is not

13:09.939 --> 13:11.500
a podunk hill town.

13:12.083 --> 13:13.583
We have

13:13.584 --> 13:15.083
a pro football team

13:12.083 --> 13:15.083
and our own omelet!

13:17.250 --> 13:18.813
Call me when you have

13:18.814 --> 13:20.375
two football teams

13:17.250 --> 13:20.375
and Jay-Z.

13:25.083 --> 13:26.126
Okay.

13:26.127 --> 13:27.167
All right, Bertram,

13:27.209 --> 13:28.889
- they're all gone,
- you can come out now.

13:32.125 --> 13:33.334
Uh-oh.

13:34.417 --> 13:35.585
BERTRAM: What does

13:35.586 --> 13:36.751
"uh-oh" mean?

13:36.792 --> 13:38.335
It locked automatically,

13:38.336 --> 13:39.876
and I need a quarter

13:36.792 --> 13:39.876
to get you out!

13:39.918 --> 13:41.147
BERTRAM:

13:41.148 --> 13:42.375
Go ahead, splurge.

13:39.918 --> 13:42.375
I'll pay you back.

13:44.334 --> 13:46.250
- I don't have
- a quarter!

13:46.292 --> 13:47.709
Okay, I'll run home

13:47.710 --> 13:49.125
to get one

13:46.292 --> 13:49.125
and be right back.

13:49.167 --> 13:50.209
Just try to relax,

13:50.250 --> 13:51.564
and breathe

13:51.565 --> 13:52.876
through this.

13:52.918 --> 13:54.125
BERTRAM: Oh, thanks.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.855
Oh, wait,

13:55.856 --> 13:57.542
where did you

13:54.167 --> 13:57.542
get this straw?

13:57.834 --> 13:58.834
From the trash.

13:59.334 --> 14:00.375
(SPITS)

14:02.918 --> 14:04.375
(BERTRAM SOBBING)

14:06.751 --> 14:08.167
- Then you never
- came back!

14:08.209 --> 14:09.709
I was stuck in here

14:09.710 --> 14:11.209
with a moldy salami

14:08.209 --> 14:11.209
sandwich!

14:12.083 --> 14:13.542
I don't see a sandwich.

14:13.584 --> 14:14.584
Don't judge me!

14:14.585 --> 14:15.584
You didn't live through

14:13.584 --> 14:15.584
what I did!

14:18.125 --> 14:19.375
- (PANTS)
- Okay, the presents

14:19.834 --> 14:21.268
- Are in one of - these lockers!
- (PANTING)

14:21.292 --> 14:22.667
We know, Sherlock!

14:23.542 --> 14:24.959
Oh, hello, Bertram.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.125
Merry Christmas.

14:26.167 --> 14:27.167
(GROANS)

14:29.292 --> 14:30.584
Aw...

14:30.626 --> 14:31.751
You must have

14:31.752 --> 14:32.876
followed my Christmas

14:30.626 --> 14:32.876
treasure hunt!

14:32.918 --> 14:34.397
Indeed we did!

14:34.398 --> 14:35.876
What a delightful

14:32.918 --> 14:35.876
romp it was!

14:36.250 --> 14:37.167
Delightful?

14:37.209 --> 14:39.125
- I was almost
- eaten by a dragon!

14:39.167 --> 14:41.042
- And the presents
- aren't even for me!

14:41.334 --> 14:42.376
My dad always hid

14:42.377 --> 14:43.417
my Christmas presents.

14:43.459 --> 14:44.689
He said, "You never get

14:44.690 --> 14:45.918
anything in life without

14:43.459 --> 14:45.918
working for it."

14:46.292 --> 14:47.375
Except presents!

14:47.417 --> 14:49.042
That's the whole point!

14:51.125 --> 14:52.334
- You know,
- I actually think

14:52.375 --> 14:53.480
A Christmas treasure

14:53.481 --> 14:54.584
hunt is very inventive.

14:54.918 --> 14:56.459
Thank you, Teddy.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.167
You're from Colorado!

14:58.209 --> 14:59.334
You think electricity

14:59.335 --> 15:00.459
is inventive!

15:01.459 --> 15:03.125
- Zuri!
- You loved Colorado

15:03.167 --> 15:05.125
- When we went skiing
- there last year.

15:05.167 --> 15:07.084
Oh, that was Colorado?

15:07.085 --> 15:09.000
I thought that was

Switzerland.

15:09.417 --> 15:11.188
Well, in my defense,

15:11.189 --> 15:12.959
it's very easy to fall

15:09.417 --> 15:12.959
asleep on a private jet.

15:14.250 --> 15:15.375
You're You are

15:15.376 --> 15:16.500
a very annoying

15:14.250 --> 15:16.500
little girl.

15:19.292 --> 15:21.059
- Bertram, which locker
- are the presents in?

15:21.083 --> 15:22.351
- They're in the locker
- next to me.

15:22.375 --> 15:24.125
- The combination
- is in my pocket,

15:24.167 --> 15:26.567
- If you'll just help - me out of here.
- It's in his pocket!

15:27.792 --> 15:28.834
(ALL GRUNTING)

15:30.250 --> 15:31.334
Got it!

15:31.375 --> 15:32.459
- Okay, come on,
- come on.

15:32.500 --> 15:33.500
Oh!

15:36.417 --> 15:37.439
(BEEPS)

15:37.440 --> 15:38.459
Wha...

15:38.500 --> 15:40.167
- We need a quarter.
- (SIGHS)

15:40.209 --> 15:41.876
Sorry, I'm all out.

15:42.500 --> 15:43.730
Well, why don't you break

15:43.731 --> 15:44.959
one of your hundreds?

15:46.083 --> 15:47.727
- I have one in my pocket,
- if you'll just...

15:47.751 --> 15:49.351
- let me out of here!
- He has a quarter!

15:49.375 --> 15:50.459
Ow! Ow! Ow!

15:51.626 --> 15:53.209
Kids, be careful!

15:53.584 --> 15:55.417
- I think this might
- qualify as a mugging.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.250
Found it!

15:58.751 --> 16:00.375
(GRUNTS)

16:01.334 --> 16:02.417
(GASPING)

16:02.459 --> 16:03.499
- (ALL CHEERING)
- Jackpot!

16:08.083 --> 16:09.500
Aw.

16:09.542 --> 16:10.896
I knew you'd have fun

16:10.897 --> 16:12.250
on my treasure hunt!

16:12.751 --> 16:13.959
Well, all's well

16:13.960 --> 16:15.167
that ends well.

16:15.209 --> 16:16.688
Get me

16:16.689 --> 16:18.167
out of here.

16:23.751 --> 16:24.814
You know, now that Bertram

16:24.815 --> 16:25.876
explained everything,

16:26.209 --> 16:27.959
- it's all starting
- to come back to me.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.314
Yeah, me, too.

16:29.315 --> 16:30.626
But I still feel like

16:28.000 --> 16:30.626
we're forgetting something.

16:31.292 --> 16:32.667
- (GROWLING)
- And there it is.

16:35.667 --> 16:36.814
Guys, I just found

16:36.815 --> 16:37.959
the weirdest thing.

16:38.292 --> 16:39.500
- Aah!
- Second weirdest.

16:41.876 --> 16:42.960
Suddenly, Zuri and Teddy

16:42.961 --> 16:44.042
being wanted for

16:44.083 --> 16:45.376
reindeer-napping

16:45.377 --> 16:46.667
makes perfect sense.

16:47.042 --> 16:49.000
- What, so you two
- stole the reindeer?

16:49.667 --> 16:50.772
Huh. There's a sentence

16:50.773 --> 16:51.876
I never thought I'd say.

16:53.542 --> 16:54.667
I don't remember

16:54.668 --> 16:55.792
stealing a reindeer!

16:56.292 --> 16:57.646
But it sounds like

16:57.647 --> 16:59.000
something someone

16:56.292 --> 16:59.000
from Denver would do.

16:59.042 --> 17:00.417
Zuri, that's enough!

17:00.459 --> 17:02.167
We don't do that!

17:02.209 --> 17:03.230
Maybe a little innocent

17:03.231 --> 17:04.250
reindeer tipping,

17:02.209 --> 17:04.250
now and then, but...

17:06.250 --> 17:07.501
It says Prancer

17:07.502 --> 17:08.751
was supposed to be a part

17:08.791 --> 17:10.553
- of the charity concert
- in the park today.

17:10.751 --> 17:12.209
- You mean,
- that deer can sing?

17:13.083 --> 17:15.000
- Oh, you two are going
- away for life.

17:18.709 --> 17:20.041
Jessie, why do we

17:20.042 --> 17:21.375
have to confess?

17:21.416 --> 17:22.626
Why can't we just

17:22.627 --> 17:23.834
release Prancer

17:21.416 --> 17:23.834
and run?

17:23.876 --> 17:25.834
- Yeah, for once,
- I agree with her.

17:26.459 --> 17:27.563
It's a Christmas miracle.

17:27.564 --> 17:28.667
Yeah.

17:29.042 --> 17:30.834
- Aw, look at that
- sad little pen.

17:31.334 --> 17:32.376
Oh, now I remember

17:32.377 --> 17:33.417
why we took him!

17:33.459 --> 17:35.250
Yeah, yeah, me, too!

17:35.292 --> 17:36.542
After we couldn't find

17:36.543 --> 17:37.792
you and Bertram last night,

17:37.834 --> 17:38.939
we saw Prancer

17:38.940 --> 17:40.042
locked up in that prison,

17:40.083 --> 17:42.059
- so I decided to - take him home.
- (TEDDY CHUCKLES)

17:42.083 --> 17:43.500
- And you went along
- with that?

17:43.792 --> 17:45.059
- I had a tough
- choice to make.

17:45.083 --> 17:46.251
Either face an angry,

17:46.252 --> 17:47.417
snorting beast,

17:48.083 --> 17:49.484
- or the reindeer.
- (DEER GROWLING)

17:51.083 --> 17:53.042
- Prancer!
- Thank goodness!

17:53.083 --> 17:54.334
Where was he?

17:54.375 --> 17:55.918
Uh, weirdest thing.

17:55.959 --> 17:57.230
We found him

17:57.231 --> 17:58.500
in our building...

17:55.959 --> 17:58.500
In the Statue of Liberty!

18:00.083 --> 18:01.834
Wait a minute.

18:02.959 --> 18:05.292
You two stole Prancer!

18:06.083 --> 18:07.751
I'm calling the cops!

18:07.792 --> 18:09.667
- Okay, okay!
- We did it.

18:10.083 --> 18:11.918
- But you wouldn't
- send three sweet,

18:11.959 --> 18:13.001
Young girls to jail,

18:13.002 --> 18:14.042
would you?

18:14.083 --> 18:16.000
- Uh, not three.
- I'm innocent.

18:17.083 --> 18:18.792
- And they're
- really sorry.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.334
- Sorry won't raise
- money for the kids.

18:21.375 --> 18:22.688
Or put toys in their

18:22.689 --> 18:24.000
donation bins.

18:24.042 --> 18:25.667
- But you've got
- Prancer back now,

18:25.709 --> 18:27.768
- And you're still having -
the charity concert, - Right?

18:27.792 --> 18:29.000
Wrong!

18:29.042 --> 18:30.481
After Prancer

18:30.482 --> 18:31.918
went missing,

18:29.042 --> 18:31.918
our singer,

18:32.083 --> 18:33.563
Joey Fatone,

18:33.564 --> 18:35.042
helped search for him.

18:35.083 --> 18:36.751
- He was out there
- all night,

18:36.792 --> 18:38.418
Calling Prancer's name,

18:38.419 --> 18:40.042
and by this morning,

18:36.792 --> 18:40.042
he lost his voice.

18:40.083 --> 18:41.230
And his watch.

18:41.231 --> 18:42.375
He was mugged.

18:44.417 --> 18:46.000
- Wow, way to bring
- down the room.

18:47.626 --> 18:48.773
She could still

18:48.774 --> 18:49.918
call the cops.

18:47.626 --> 18:49.918
Dial it back.

18:53.083 --> 18:54.230
So now the charity event

18:54.231 --> 18:55.375
has their reindeer back,

18:55.417 --> 18:56.697
- but they don't
- have a singer.

18:56.876 --> 18:58.147
Zuri, I am so

18:58.148 --> 18:59.417
disappointed in you.

19:00.083 --> 19:01.105
I can't believe

19:01.106 --> 19:02.125
you stole a reindeer

19:00.083 --> 19:02.125
without me!

19:02.167 --> 19:03.959
- That was on my
- bucket list!

19:04.792 --> 19:06.250
- As long as
- I'm not on it.

19:08.083 --> 19:09.542
I can't believe we came

19:09.543 --> 19:11.000
so close to meeting

19:08.083 --> 19:11.000
the Joey Fatone.

19:13.083 --> 19:14.626
Guys,

19:14.667 --> 19:16.334
the point is,

19:16.335 --> 19:18.000
this event was going

19:14.667 --> 19:18.000
to help a lot of kids

19:18.042 --> 19:19.459
have a happy Christmas,

19:19.460 --> 19:20.876
and now that's not

19:18.042 --> 19:20.876
going to happen.

19:21.083 --> 19:22.730
And it's all our fault!

19:22.731 --> 19:24.375
I feel terrible.

19:24.667 --> 19:26.293
We were so upset

19:26.294 --> 19:27.918
when we could not find

19:24.667 --> 19:27.918
our presents.

19:27.959 --> 19:29.730
Imagine how these kids

19:29.731 --> 19:31.500
will feel when they

19:27.959 --> 19:31.500
do not get any.

19:31.542 --> 19:33.101
- There's got to be
- something we can do.

19:33.125 --> 19:34.459
Wait!

19:34.500 --> 19:36.000
- I just got
- the greatest idea!

19:36.125 --> 19:37.918
- You can sing
- at the charity concert,

19:37.959 --> 19:40.230
Which will attract

19:40.231 --> 19:42.500
a huge crowd of toy-givers,

19:37.959 --> 19:42.500
thereby saving the day?

19:43.000 --> 19:44.250
Actually, I was gonna say

19:44.251 --> 19:45.500
we do an emergency

19:43.000 --> 19:45.500
bake sale,

19:45.542 --> 19:47.000
- but I like your idea
- way better!

19:51.459 --> 19:53.101
- Jessie, thank you so much - for
offering to sing - For the charity.

19:53.125 --> 19:54.792
(CHUCKLES)

19:55.083 --> 19:56.834
You can sing, right?

19:59.042 --> 20:00.459
Like a bird.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.059
- And she looks cuter - than a partridge
- In a pear tree!

20:02.083 --> 20:03.626
- (CHUCKLES)
- Thanks.

20:04.542 --> 20:05.689
I just wish we had

20:05.690 --> 20:06.834
more than three peeps

20:04.542 --> 20:06.834
a watchin'.

20:07.209 --> 20:08.980
Yeah,

20:08.981 --> 20:10.751
it's not the turnout

20:07.209 --> 20:10.751
we expected,

20:10.792 --> 20:12.459
- but at least
- we'll get a few toys.

20:13.125 --> 20:14.876
- More than a few!
- Look.

20:15.125 --> 20:16.959
(GASPING)

20:19.918 --> 20:21.584
Look at all the presents!

20:24.000 --> 20:25.022
Jessie, we thought about

20:25.023 --> 20:26.042
what you said,

20:26.083 --> 20:27.935
- and we realized - we've only been
- Thinking about

20:27.959 --> 20:29.751
- Ourselves
- this Christmas.

20:29.792 --> 20:31.418
So we want to donate

20:31.419 --> 20:33.042
all of our presents

20:29.792 --> 20:33.042
to the toy drive.

20:33.083 --> 20:34.167
You do?

20:35.083 --> 20:36.918
- That is so
- sweet of you.

20:37.083 --> 20:38.334
I am so proud

20:38.335 --> 20:39.584
of you guys!

20:39.626 --> 20:41.125
- Well, we already have
- so much.

20:42.167 --> 20:43.667
And you know what?

20:43.709 --> 20:45.500
- Not being selfish
- feels really good.

20:46.083 --> 20:47.459
Aw, Luke.

20:48.667 --> 20:50.314
(CHUCKLES) Wow,

20:50.315 --> 20:51.959
look what was tucked

20:48.667 --> 20:51.959
in with these socks!

22:54.167 --> 22:56.167
Guys, check this out.

22:56.209 --> 22:57.626
I think I just found

22:57.627 --> 22:59.042
something that will

22:56.209 --> 22:59.042
explain everything!

23:00.083 --> 23:01.563
Charlie, if you find this

23:01.564 --> 23:03.042

23:00.083 --> 23:03.042

23:03.083 --> 23:04.764
- your sister got run over
- by a reindeer!

23:06.709 --> 23:07.709
(GROWLING)

23:09.209 --> 23:11.268
- Prancer, you are about
- to go on the naughty list!

23:11.292 --> 23:12.834
Ow!

23:13.167 --> 23:14.250

23:18.792 --> 23:20.793
- Now I know why - Santa leaves them
- On the roof.

23:20.876 --> 23:21.876
(GROWLING)

23:23.375 --> 23:23.709
- Ravi!
- Where's that

23:23.375 --> 23:24.375
Knock-out serum?

23:25.167 --> 23:27.008
- We need to tranquilize
- this reindeer, stat!

23:27.459 --> 23:29.059
- Almost there! - Luke, add the chartreuse
- Chemical!

23:29.083 --> 23:31.042
- I don't know what
- chartreuse is!

23:31.083 --> 23:32.918
- Uh, here!
- Let's use this!

23:32.959 --> 23:33.980
No!

23:33.981 --> 23:35.000
That is turquoise,

23:32.959 --> 23:35.000
you idiot!

23:36.792 --> 23:38.001

23:38.002 --> 23:39.209
have red, blue, green,

23:36.792 --> 23:39.209
and yellow?

23:39.250 --> 23:41.125
- Uh-oh! You have turned
- the knock-out serum

23:41.167 --> 23:42.584
Into a vapor,

23:42.585 --> 23:44.000
which could knock us out!

23:44.959 --> 23:46.125
(COUGHING)

23:47.083 --> 23:48.418
Hide!

23:48.419 --> 23:49.751
Knock-out vapor

23:47.083 --> 23:49.751
on the loose!

23:51.083 --> 23:52.834
(COUGHING)

23:52.876 --> 23:55.036
- Is that a fancy way of - saying you cut
- The cheese?

23:58.250 --> 23:59.959
- Whoa,

24:05.167 --> 24:06.189
Can't...

24:06.190 --> 24:07.209
Sleep.

Wish us good luck,

24:15.898 --> 24:17.000

24:21.023 --> 24:22.751
