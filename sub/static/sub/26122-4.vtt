♪ ♪

00:11.145 --> 00:13.245
SUE: I got hit with a
decent amount of snow.

00:13.280 --> 00:16.448
The thing that happens here
is, you get a bunch of snow,

00:16.484 --> 00:18.717
but then the
wind sends it all the way
out to the Arctic Ocean.

00:21.522 --> 00:25.124
Next time, the north wind
comes in and sends it
back down to Fairbanks.

00:25.426 --> 00:27.960
You don't know when a
blizzard's going to come up.

00:27.995 --> 00:31.163
But this right here,
this is why I got to get
the tracks on everything.

00:32.533 --> 00:35.734
On the Argo, the tires
don't make it through
snow like this.

00:35.770 --> 00:37.202
My clearance isn't that much.

00:37.238 --> 00:39.805
You reach a point,
even though it's
got a powerful engine,

00:39.840 --> 00:43.442
the tires will just
start spinning on this,
this wet, heavy snow.

00:46.747 --> 00:50.182
As the temperature
and the conditions change,
your vehicles have to

00:50.217 --> 00:51.650
morph with the times.

00:51.685 --> 00:53.685
Welcome to the next
eight months up in Kavik.

00:54.288 --> 00:56.855
It can be a desolate,
harsh climate.

00:56.891 --> 00:59.992
But it's teeming with
its own forms of life.

01:00.027 --> 01:02.261
If I don't get this done,
I won't be one of them.

01:03.631 --> 01:09.268
(theme music plays).

01:29.490 --> 01:35.027
The tires have to drive on
track and then somehow, I got
to get it to curl back over.

01:35.229 --> 01:37.496
I'm, I just, I'm, I'm
unclear how to do that.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.965
I've been extremely worried.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.301
Spent all night awake,
trying to figure out
how the heck I'm going to

01:42.336 --> 01:45.637
do this because I know
it's, it's a two-person job.

01:46.006 --> 01:48.540
It's not a one-person job.

01:49.076 --> 01:51.844
I enjoy problem solving.

01:51.879 --> 01:55.013
Sometimes, I can get
a little frustrated.

01:59.620 --> 02:03.055
It doesn't stop me from
getting my job done.

02:03.090 --> 02:06.492
Because I'm the only
one here doing the job.

02:14.869 --> 02:17.236
Oh, yeah, right.

02:17.271 --> 02:20.672
Seriously, seriously?

02:20.708 --> 02:22.941
So, how far off am I?

02:22.977 --> 02:26.812
Several inches.

02:26.847 --> 02:31.483
So, I just need to
think how I'm going to get
these two pieces together.

02:31.852 --> 02:35.687
There's slack, if you look,
you've got a little dip here.

02:35.923 --> 02:38.690
A little dip there.
A little dip here.

02:38.726 --> 02:44.930
But if the tires are full,
I might be able just to
take air out of the tires.

02:46.350 --> 02:50.068
Is it key for me to
get my tracks put on and
winterize these vehicles?

02:50.104 --> 02:53.005
Absolutely.

02:53.040 --> 02:56.475
As the planet changes,
I'm getting more snow.

02:56.510 --> 03:01.813
I went and had three foot
of snow and down below
zero temps early on.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.449
Now, it's warmer temps, make
hay while the sun shines.

03:05.186 --> 03:08.086
Get the chores
done when your fingers
aren't going to freeze.

03:08.122 --> 03:13.058
I have more viable time to
work without a glove at 20
above than I do at 20 below.

03:16.197 --> 03:19.731
See if it's making
any difference yet.

03:20.501 --> 03:23.869
It's coming together.

03:24.872 --> 03:28.407
That fits really well now.

03:28.442 --> 03:31.510
Moving, and voila.

03:31.946 --> 03:34.413
Once you get one,
boom, boom, boom, boom.

03:34.448 --> 03:35.881
It's like a zipper.

03:35.916 --> 03:38.550
It, it'll start coming
together better.

03:41.989 --> 03:44.556
Ratchet in a little
tighter on that side.

03:47.995 --> 03:51.096
Okay, there we go.

03:51.115 --> 03:53.532
One side done.

03:54.235 --> 03:57.569
The second one, I'm going to
do just like I did the first.

03:57.605 --> 04:00.706
I might have made
it a little harder than
it needed to be by being

04:00.741 --> 04:02.708
inexperienced at doing it.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.943
But guess what, I got it done.

04:04.979 --> 04:08.513
I guarantee you, by the time
next winter rolls around,
there's a whole new game plan

04:08.549 --> 04:10.482
for how to do this.

04:10.550 --> 04:13.819
It's never about being
stagnant, it's about
using your time wisely.

04:13.854 --> 04:16.989
Work smarter, not harder.

04:19.627 --> 04:23.829
Today, uh, getting
these tracks on, took
up all of my day.

04:23.864 --> 04:27.299
All of my chore allocation
time went on that.

04:28.569 --> 04:32.271
But overall,
a job only takes as
long as it's supposed to.

04:33.007 --> 04:36.074
But for tonight, it's
lights out, and mama's
putting her feet up.

04:41.448 --> 04:42.914
CHIP: This kind of
life is healthy.

04:42.983 --> 04:45.083
You're not overweight,
you're not struggling.

04:45.119 --> 04:47.953
This is just like
a good workout.

04:59.333 --> 05:02.284
Yeah, we got about two
hours of sunlight left.

05:02.569 --> 05:04.036
We can go get this done.

05:04.071 --> 05:05.837
<i> NARRATOR: For the Hailstones,</i>

05:18.719 --> 05:22.287
CHIP: Right now, the
ice isn't very thick and
we've got a ton of snow,

05:22.323 --> 05:23.455
which we usually don't have.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.307
And, um, I'm thinking, just
go put out a few traps.

05:25.359 --> 05:28.093
Maybe I can get ahold of a few
foxes or something right now.

05:29.296 --> 05:31.763
I've got, um, body hold traps.

05:31.799 --> 05:33.932
I got leg holds, and
I have snare wire.

05:34.268 --> 05:36.968
So, we're going to have
plenty to do today.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.570
The trap's I've got
are in bags right now.

05:38.605 --> 05:42.407
I dyed them, and I've
boiled them, and gotten rid
of all the scent and, um,

05:42.426 --> 05:44.242
basically I don't use my
working gloves on them.

05:44.278 --> 05:47.879
I wouldn't want them smelling
like gasoline or like myself,
or something I've touched

05:47.915 --> 05:49.481
around the house.

05:49.516 --> 05:52.150
And, um, they're pretty
much scent free and they're
pretty much ready to go.

05:54.138 --> 05:56.672
I'm going to go to a
lake over here, it's about
2 miles away, 3 miles away.

05:56.707 --> 05:59.308
The best thing I could get it
would probably be a wolverine.

05:59.343 --> 06:01.743
What I'm really kind of
just looking for is some
foxes because foxes tan

06:01.779 --> 06:04.880
quickly and easily, and make a
really great hat.

06:04.915 --> 06:07.950
When you're out at 40 below
and you got a nice fox
hat, then you stay warm.

06:07.985 --> 06:09.718
You can't have too
many furs right now.

06:09.753 --> 06:11.086
It's just one of those things.

06:11.121 --> 06:13.222
It's like a commodity to us.

06:15.626 --> 06:17.159
AGNES: You see those
fox tracks over there?

06:17.194 --> 06:19.061
CHIP: I'm going to go have a
look and see what's doable.

06:20.030 --> 06:21.797
AGNES: Is that a good spot?

06:21.832 --> 06:23.398
Should I untie the sled?

06:23.400 --> 06:25.000
CHIP: Yeah, would you, please?

06:25.035 --> 06:26.668
I've got one good
spot right here.

06:26.704 --> 06:28.937
I'm going to put leg holds.

06:30.941 --> 06:33.575
AGNES: I'm glad we brought
this whole skin so we
can just pick and choose,

06:33.811 --> 06:36.345
and let the hairs
fly as you cut it and
set it for your bait.

06:36.547 --> 06:38.080
CHIP: Oh, yeah, some of
the best bait there is.

06:38.115 --> 06:41.717
AGNES: We've seen a few
tracks and that's why we
decided to trap this area.

06:42.553 --> 06:44.353
CHIP: I'm putting up
some bait right here.

06:44.388 --> 06:46.788
I'm going to put a couple
leg holds underneath it.

06:46.824 --> 06:49.291
Well, I like this spot
because I see a regular
trail going by it,

06:49.326 --> 06:51.760
and I know an animal's
going to pass by here.

06:51.795 --> 06:52.894
Particularly one I want.

06:52.930 --> 06:54.496
And I want a fox right now.

06:54.531 --> 06:56.665
Usually, I set
these in tandem.

06:56.700 --> 06:58.033
Set two of them together.

06:58.068 --> 06:59.835
I've got twice the
luck that way, I guess.

06:59.870 --> 07:02.037
The animal can't really,
uh, go anywhere with them.

07:02.072 --> 07:05.107
He gets two of these on
his legs and he's done for.

07:05.743 --> 07:09.278
And I'm using the caribou
hair to kind of make
a scent or something,

07:09.313 --> 07:12.914
something the animal can pick
up on, thinking that there's
probably something buried here

07:12.950 --> 07:15.017
that it can dig up and eat.

07:15.286 --> 07:17.753
Okay, that's as good
as it gets, I guess.

07:20.658 --> 07:24.226
Think we'll go down here and
get inside the slough, and
take ourselves up the slough.

07:26.497 --> 07:28.497
You want to put a
trap right here?

07:28.766 --> 07:29.898
We might as well go
with the leg holds.

07:29.933 --> 07:32.234
AGNES: Yup.

07:33.804 --> 07:35.170
Are you going to
use the fish trap?

07:35.205 --> 07:37.606
CHIP: Yeah, cause we're by
the water, we should use fish.

07:37.641 --> 07:40.542
AGNES: Yeah.

07:43.514 --> 07:45.947
CHIP: I am putting a leg
hold trap into place.

07:45.983 --> 07:49.051
I'm making like a little
place here where I can
snuggle the trap into.

07:53.590 --> 07:56.191
AGNES: This is the, going to
be a fun ride every other day.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.226
CHIP: It's probably going to
be every day, not every other.

07:58.228 --> 08:00.062
With leg holds, you got
to check them every day.

08:00.097 --> 08:01.697
AGNES: What are those
tracks over there?

08:01.732 --> 08:03.365
CHIP: Those are
ptarmigan and fox.

08:03.400 --> 08:06.601
There's a heavy traffic
of fox coming around
this little point here.

08:06.637 --> 08:10.339
AGNES: Next time, I'm going
to bring a .22, so when
we see those ptarmigan,

08:10.374 --> 08:14.409
we can stop and try
to take a few shots.

08:17.081 --> 08:18.080
Good spot, ah?

08:18.098 --> 08:20.515
CHIP: Yup, we'll
be back tomorrow.

08:20.851 --> 08:23.485
AGNES: Yeah,
I'm glad we got done
before it get too dark,

08:24.154 --> 08:27.956
and we have a good trail blazed.

08:30.227 --> 08:32.561
ANDY: One of the
things I've learned over
the years around here is you

08:32.596 --> 08:35.931
don't fight
Mother Nature when she
decides to do something.

08:35.966 --> 08:38.834
Never pays to force
things out here.

08:46.443 --> 08:49.678
Oh, this sled's
seen better days.

08:53.951 --> 08:56.251
Time to build a new sled.

08:56.286 --> 08:58.820
I pretty much destroyed this
one this year on the ice.

08:59.323 --> 09:03.492
So, I'm going to salvage
pieces and parts off of this
sled and build another one.

09:03.794 --> 09:06.661
I've heard that there
is caribou in the area.

09:06.697 --> 09:09.264
And I'm real anxious
to get out and get some
meat because I didn't get a

09:09.299 --> 09:11.566
moose this year.

09:11.568 --> 09:14.269
This is the first
year in many years I
haven't gotten a moose.

09:14.304 --> 09:17.672
And, uh, it left a lot
of anxiety in me for how
am I going to feed myself

09:17.708 --> 09:20.008
through the winter.

09:20.043 --> 09:23.678
Hearing that the caribou are
around right now is really
picking up my spirits and

09:23.680 --> 09:25.313
making me want to get out.

09:25.382 --> 09:27.649
They are kind of a
ghostly type of animal.

09:27.684 --> 09:29.918
They're either here
or they're not.

09:29.953 --> 09:33.855
So, when they come through
the country, you got to go
get them as quick as you can.

09:33.891 --> 09:35.524
It's all driven by
the clock right now.

09:35.559 --> 09:37.426
And the clock's ticking.

09:37.628 --> 09:41.496
I'm feeling pretty
up against the gun right now
to try and get out there and

09:41.532 --> 09:45.267
hunt some of those guys
before they disappear.

09:46.804 --> 09:51.006
The biggest challenge
you always struggle with in
the wintertime is the darkness.

09:51.041 --> 09:53.658
Our days are only four to
five hours of daylight.

09:53.694 --> 09:56.928
It doesn't give you a
lot of time to really
get out and hunt.

09:56.964 --> 10:00.065
You pile on top of that
that this is the time of
the year the Yukon River

10:00.100 --> 10:02.234
is really unpredictable.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.236
Uh, icing happens
really heavily.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.972
The water levels can
fluctuate really quickly.

10:07.007 --> 10:09.808
Overflow can come in
and, uh, cut you off.

10:09.843 --> 10:12.811
Makes for, uh, a lot
of challenges to overcome,

10:12.846 --> 10:15.730
just to get to where
the caribou are at.

10:18.118 --> 10:21.253
All right.
All that for a piece of metal.

10:23.891 --> 10:28.059
I've got all the
raw materials to build this,
between salvaging the skegs

10:28.162 --> 10:30.228
and brand new plastic,

10:30.264 --> 10:33.498
I want to, I want
to run chain all the
way along each one of

10:33.534 --> 10:37.936
these bolts here so that
any time I have a load,

10:37.971 --> 10:40.539
I've got something I
can hook into with my tie down

10:40.574 --> 10:45.544
strap, that's really
strong and firm, and isn't
going to fray and break.

10:45.579 --> 10:48.547
This sled's going to
be able to haul probably
800, 900 pounds at a time.

10:49.917 --> 10:54.152
So, I want to have my tie down
points really, really strong
so I don't have to worry about

10:54.188 --> 10:56.922
things busting when
I'm hauling a load.

10:57.124 --> 10:59.090
Get these things
sharpened up a little bit.

10:59.126 --> 11:02.327
Try and make these to
where they dig into the
ice a little better.

11:05.499 --> 11:07.682
This country's really
hard on your equipment.

11:07.734 --> 11:10.001
Freighting a lot of heavy
loads over rough conditions.

11:10.037 --> 11:12.904
If you get two or three
years out of a sled,
you're doing pretty good.

11:14.842 --> 11:19.544
That's just the way it is, you
have to plan on building new
equipment from time to time.

11:19.746 --> 11:22.781
You have to plan
on maintaining your
equipment all the time.

11:25.185 --> 11:29.654
I'm going to bend this
plastic back up so that I have
a curve here in the front.

11:33.727 --> 11:35.694
Three quarters.

11:37.097 --> 11:39.231
One twelve and three quarters.

11:39.266 --> 11:42.033
All right.
Let's see if I can hit
this thing with some heat.

11:43.203 --> 11:48.273
So, the idea here is just
to heat all this plastic
so that it takes this bend.

11:48.909 --> 11:52.878
Basically, what I'm
doing is I'm relaxing
the plastic right now.

11:54.381 --> 12:00.552
I'm heating it up, spreading
the molecules, and then when
it cools they should stay

12:00.654 --> 12:04.656
right where they're, pretty
close to where they were at.

12:09.696 --> 12:13.198
All right, that
should be hot enough.

12:14.034 --> 12:15.800
Looking good.

12:15.836 --> 12:18.737
I got the sled built,
it's a long night.

12:18.772 --> 12:22.974
And, uh, I think I got
a really good rig here
for multiple purposes.

12:23.343 --> 12:28.713
I'm hoping my first use is
to put some bloody caribou
in it and haul it home.

12:31.752 --> 12:33.685
JESSIE: It's very
easy to be here in the now,

12:33.720 --> 12:36.187
but it's all about
thinking the next
step, the next stage.

12:50.003 --> 12:53.872
Well, we had a good
little cold snap, and, uh,
followed by a bunch of snow,

12:53.907 --> 12:56.775
so we got some ice built
up down here on the
slough and the river.

12:57.644 --> 13:01.813
I'm going to go down there and
look about putting in myself
in a permanent water hole,

13:01.848 --> 13:04.649
that I'll be able to get
water out of all winter.

13:04.685 --> 13:07.018
I don't really have a way
of getting water right here,

13:07.054 --> 13:08.353
so I have to
go down to the river,

13:08.355 --> 13:10.789
which takes a lot of time.

13:11.725 --> 13:13.625
Water is the most
important thing.

13:13.660 --> 13:16.795
Having so many dogs, I use
at least 40 gallons a day.

13:16.830 --> 13:18.663
That dog food cooker
is full of water.

13:18.699 --> 13:20.515
There's broth
for my race dogs.

13:20.567 --> 13:22.467
There's washing
water for everything.

13:22.502 --> 13:26.538
A lot of people think it's
romanticized to live without
electricity or without running

13:26.573 --> 13:29.140
water, but that's not
an option out here.

13:29.176 --> 13:33.578
The only reason I'm able to
afford to do this with my dogs
is because I don't have those.

13:34.481 --> 13:37.449
I got my chainsaw and
my ice pick, that's all
I should need right now.

13:37.484 --> 13:40.051
I'm going to go down
here to the slough and I'm
going to look at what it's

13:40.087 --> 13:42.620
going to take to
get out on that ice.

13:46.093 --> 13:47.759
This year, I got
a snow machine.

13:47.761 --> 13:51.329
The main reason I got the
snow machine is so I can
use it for utilitarian work

13:52.065 --> 13:54.032
that I usually do with the dogs.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.900
Cause usually I'm hauling
all my wood with my dogs.

13:55.936 --> 13:59.938
All the water with my dogs,
the snow machine gives me a
way of doing things faster and

13:59.973 --> 14:02.207
more efficient, while leaving
the dogs out of that picture.

14:02.609 --> 14:05.210
While I like doing
those things with dogs, I'm
trying to be faster and more

14:05.245 --> 14:09.080
efficient, and my, training
my dogs is going to be way
more focused on racing now.

14:11.084 --> 14:14.219
Hopefully, haul a lot
of water in a couple hours
to where I have enough water

14:14.254 --> 14:15.787
for the whole week.

14:15.822 --> 14:18.189
That way, I can
stay ahead of it.

14:22.329 --> 14:25.530
Well, it looks like what
we got going on here
is a lot of overflow.

14:25.565 --> 14:28.933
This was all froze
up pretty good, but all
this snow came and pushed a

14:28.969 --> 14:30.201
bunch of water up.

14:30.237 --> 14:32.070
If you're out in
the wilderness and
you're running dogs,

14:32.105 --> 14:34.506
and you go through overflow,
it can be really dangerous.

14:34.941 --> 14:36.341
Whoa.

14:40.497 --> 14:41.863
JESSIE: Whoa.

14:41.898 --> 14:44.332
Definitely won't be
able to get the snow
machine over this.

14:45.602 --> 14:47.802
Damn that's deep.

14:49.206 --> 14:52.841
So, I need to get out
here and check this ice,
and see how that is.

14:52.876 --> 14:54.843
Uh, hopefully, it's
not as deep here.

14:54.878 --> 14:59.647
See if I can't use
this plywood to disperse my
weight when I walk out there.

14:59.683 --> 15:02.817
And see if I can see how deep
it is out towards the middle.

15:18.135 --> 15:21.970
I had to be careful, you never
know what to expect with ice.

15:29.446 --> 15:32.213
Oh, man (bleep).

15:32.449 --> 15:35.049
Not good.
Not (bleep) good.

15:35.085 --> 15:37.919
Nope, too deep.

15:39.055 --> 15:40.755
This is a pain in
my ass right now.

15:40.791 --> 15:43.258
I can't get the direct
way to the river I wanted.

15:43.293 --> 15:45.460
This has been something I've
been envisioning a long time.

15:45.495 --> 15:49.164
Being able to shoot
right out of my dog yard,
right onto the slough here

15:49.199 --> 15:52.367
with the dogs or
with the snow machine
to haul water and wood.

15:52.369 --> 15:55.537
This isn't going to work out.

15:56.006 --> 15:58.206
I'm not going to be able
to get out on this safely.

15:58.241 --> 16:01.476
I can't risk going out
there and getting wet or
sinking my snow machine.

16:02.545 --> 16:05.680
I'm going to go the longer
way around to the river and
go ahead and start working on

16:05.715 --> 16:08.049
putting my hole in down there.

16:08.084 --> 16:10.185
Cause I need water,
I got to get this hole in,

16:10.220 --> 16:12.821
and I can't wait
for this to freeze up.

16:16.560 --> 16:18.193
CHIP: We spend a lot of time
together, me and the family.

16:18.228 --> 16:21.462
To us, it's just, uh,
another part of living here.

16:31.608 --> 16:33.708
<i> NARRATOR: The Hailstones</i>
<i> are checking the</i>
<i> traps they set in hopes</i>

16:33.743 --> 16:36.544
<i> of harvesting animals</i>
<i> for their fur.</i>

16:36.580 --> 16:38.646
<i> The hides are a</i>

16:38.682 --> 16:42.083

16:45.889 --> 16:47.021
CHIP: Wonderful.

16:47.057 --> 16:48.756
Look like lot of
little tracks here.

16:48.792 --> 16:50.658
Oh, ravens.

16:50.694 --> 16:52.126
Look, ravens got the bait.

16:52.162 --> 16:53.795
There's a trap under here.

16:53.830 --> 16:56.931
And there's a trap right
here, and you can see where
the raven took off with it.

16:57.968 --> 17:00.235
I don't know if it was
the wind or just my poor
construction techniques,

17:00.270 --> 17:03.438
but the little, look,
these things aren't
keeping the ravens off.

17:03.473 --> 17:06.474
We need to build a
little hut here and the
ravens won't be able to,

17:06.509 --> 17:09.077
the ravens won't go into it.

17:10.814 --> 17:14.549
Well, I want to put the bait
under the willows, where the,
where the ravens won't see

17:14.584 --> 17:20.688
them and kind of as a way
to guide an animal into
a place I want him to be.

17:20.724 --> 17:24.125
They must have really
come around here and
had a good, fine meal.

17:25.161 --> 17:27.228
Next one, I guess.

17:32.002 --> 17:35.036
AGNES: All kinds of tracks.
This might be a perfect spot.

17:35.405 --> 17:38.673
CHIP: Well, we got one last
use for this wolf carcass.

17:39.309 --> 17:42.610
This is a conibear,
these kind right here,
kill an animal outright,

17:43.179 --> 17:45.380
deader than dead when
they get ahold of them.

17:45.415 --> 17:49.784
And these springs probably
have about 80 pounds
of push on them each.

17:50.086 --> 17:53.054
And they're not an easy
deal to get down with the
chains swinging into them,

17:53.089 --> 17:54.956
and all this other
(bleep) getting in my way.

17:54.991 --> 17:58.359
Flip it up for me.

17:59.229 --> 18:01.963
That sure would be nice
if you would do it, soon.

18:01.998 --> 18:04.499
AGNES: Missed.
CHIP: Yeah.

18:04.701 --> 18:06.634
I'm really glad you're
helping me, and if I'm
sounding frustrated,

18:06.670 --> 18:10.204
it's only because I'm
holding down 80 pounds
of trap against my palm.

18:10.240 --> 18:12.573
AGNES: And if I won't
put my finger there, that's
just because I'm afraid

18:12.609 --> 18:14.409
I'm going to get caught.

18:14.444 --> 18:17.312
CHIP: Conibears were
developed a long time ago.

18:17.347 --> 18:20.548
People were using
them, but a lot of people
wanted live traps because

18:20.583 --> 18:22.150
when you catch an animal,

18:22.185 --> 18:24.585
and he's alive, the
ravens won't ruin the skin.

18:25.488 --> 18:29.090
If I catch an animal
in this, and I don't catch
it before the ravens come,

18:29.125 --> 18:30.491
they'll ruin your skin.

18:30.527 --> 18:32.160
You'll have to reset
them, kill another animal.

18:32.195 --> 18:33.861
And you don't want to
do that for nothing.

18:33.897 --> 18:36.931
So, our plan is to build a
nice cubby here around this
wolf carcass, and hopefully,

18:36.967 --> 18:39.133
the ravens won't
see it and come in.

18:39.169 --> 18:42.537
And hopefully, the ravens,
when they see other animals
at it won't bother them.

18:42.572 --> 18:44.038
Ravens are really smart.

18:44.074 --> 18:47.542
They're our number
one competition when
it comes to good fur.

18:47.577 --> 18:48.743
AGNES: Now,
that's an entrance.

18:48.778 --> 18:50.712
CHIP: My little
fence in place.

18:50.747 --> 18:53.381
I got a good double set
and a good double set.

18:53.416 --> 18:55.283
We check our
traps and if we have
more traps to put out,

18:55.302 --> 18:57.785
every day we put
out a couple more sets
and a couple more sets,

18:57.821 --> 18:58.920
and a couple more sets.

18:58.955 --> 19:01.723
And it's called
building a line.

19:04.961 --> 19:06.527
SUE: I don't want to
anticipate trouble.

19:06.563 --> 19:09.564
Trouble just seems to find me.

19:13.670 --> 19:15.336
Storm was just starting.

19:15.372 --> 19:16.904
But it's ramping up now.

19:16.923 --> 19:18.973
And it's going to
continue to ramp.

19:19.009 --> 19:21.476
So, what I'm going
to do, I'm going to
go look at the shop.

19:21.511 --> 19:23.578
Make sure everything's
buttoned up well.

19:23.613 --> 19:26.781
And then I'm probably
going to change activities.

19:27.017 --> 19:30.518
<i> NARRATOR: With a storm</i>
<i> in Kavik, Sue has prepared</i>
<i> her all-terrain vehicle</i>

19:30.553 --> 19:32.520

19:35.625 --> 19:38.126

19:39.829 --> 19:42.430
SUE: I've got a beautiful
blank, white canvas.

19:42.465 --> 19:47.268
Perfect opportunity, not
to go hunting, but to see
who's traveling in my area,

19:48.104 --> 19:50.505
what do I need to be aware of.

19:50.540 --> 19:51.939
Well, I've got some game cams.

19:51.975 --> 19:53.374
I've never used one.

19:53.410 --> 19:56.310
And they take pictures
of an area without you
having to be present.

19:58.481 --> 20:02.350
Each time I walk out in the
frigid temperatures to see
what's out there, number one,

20:02.385 --> 20:04.786
I may scare it away
and never find out.

20:04.821 --> 20:06.454
It can attack me.

20:06.489 --> 20:07.889
I can get hurt doing it.

20:07.924 --> 20:10.391
If I put a game
cam out that takes
the pictures for me,

20:10.427 --> 20:12.960
I can either determine
it's just doing its own thing,

20:12.996 --> 20:15.663
or it's coming in
religiously and I got to,

20:15.698 --> 20:18.366
I got to deal with that.

20:19.002 --> 20:22.570
Areas that concern me,
where my incinerator,
I burn garbage.

20:23.289 --> 20:26.140
That is a total dinner
bell to anything that
might be in my area.

20:27.477 --> 20:30.978
What this is
going to give me is this
whole panorama here.

20:31.481 --> 20:36.250
So, if it's coming
from the East, the West, the
North, my incinerators there.

20:38.354 --> 20:41.422
Even though food and
garbage gets burnt, it's
still a source that they

20:41.458 --> 20:43.858
tend to look at.

20:44.127 --> 20:46.294
Let's see how I
want to do this.

20:46.496 --> 20:50.264
It's going to sit like this.

20:50.600 --> 20:52.100
Why do I use wire?

20:52.135 --> 20:54.469
It's a lot harder for
an animal to chew through
the wire than it is some

20:54.504 --> 20:57.371
kind of a leash material.

20:57.407 --> 20:59.640
Some paracord or something.

21:03.379 --> 21:06.280
Okay. So, I've got
it where I want it.

21:06.316 --> 21:09.283
I've got it attached so
nothing can run off with it.

21:09.352 --> 21:14.722
So now, I'm going to open
it up, and turn it on.

21:18.261 --> 21:20.862
Catch something
good for me, buddy.

21:20.964 --> 21:22.363
All right.

21:22.398 --> 21:27.301
Uh, the next spot
that I'd like to go to
is further down this way,

21:28.338 --> 21:30.037
maybe half a mile.

21:30.073 --> 21:33.674
It's a deep ravine and
I've gone in it before
to get to the water.

21:33.710 --> 21:38.012
It's a widely used area, and
I want to see who's using it.

21:49.592 --> 21:52.360
I'm just trying to warm
everything up a little bit.

21:52.395 --> 21:55.496
It's having a
hard time turning.

21:56.332 --> 21:57.532
See what do I already see?

21:57.567 --> 21:59.500
I see footprints.

21:59.536 --> 22:02.503
Decent sized prints.

22:03.106 --> 22:07.742
So, I'll take a little
look see, and see where I
can maybe put another cam.

22:12.182 --> 22:15.116
That's not good.

22:15.618 --> 22:17.885
It's not wanting to
turn to the right.

22:18.888 --> 22:21.355
Why are you not wanting
to turn (bleep)?

22:53.056 --> 22:55.990
to the right.

22:59.162 --> 23:01.362
It's, uh, it's a,
it's a steering lock.

23:01.397 --> 23:02.797
It's just loose.

23:02.832 --> 23:07.468
The other hand is holding
onto the steering line.

23:07.503 --> 23:10.504
It's not tight, so
it's giving me (bleep).

23:10.540 --> 23:12.373
So, I'll have to figure
out how to tighten that.

23:12.408 --> 23:15.376
But for right now,
I'm going down here.

23:15.712 --> 23:18.079
This is a good little
highway for the animals.

23:18.114 --> 23:20.014
The caribou love it,
there's lots of feed.

23:20.049 --> 23:21.682
The moose that
are here love it.

23:21.718 --> 23:22.783
Lots of feed.

23:22.819 --> 23:25.653
The foxes have
their dens here.

23:25.688 --> 23:29.023
It's a good,
well-traveled area.

23:32.695 --> 23:34.695
Okay, armed and dangerous.

23:34.731 --> 23:36.597
It is on.

23:36.799 --> 23:38.366
And I think I'm
happy with that.

23:38.401 --> 23:41.736
This one is on, so it's
going to catch this.

23:44.641 --> 23:46.374
Anything going by.

23:46.409 --> 23:49.577
All right, onto
the next location.

23:50.980 --> 23:53.948
In this area, I always see
the big wolverine tracks.

23:53.983 --> 23:55.650
I always see the
big wolf track.

23:55.685 --> 23:57.852
This is just the highway.

24:04.827 --> 24:08.562
This is a beautiful little
draw, so this works for me.

24:12.935 --> 24:15.870
I wanna kinda make this tight.

24:18.041 --> 24:20.541
It's actually
fairly secure there.

24:20.576 --> 24:23.577
I was blessed with
a pair of eyes and they
don't have night vision.

24:24.247 --> 24:29.617
This is four or five more sets
of eyes that can see just as
well in the day as it can at

24:29.652 --> 24:33.020
night and it's only
gonna clip those things
when something's moving.

24:33.022 --> 24:35.589
So knowledge,
knowledge, knowledge.

24:35.925 --> 24:39.493
I'll know what's in my
neighborhood, how often
they're coming close,

24:39.529 --> 24:41.062
what direction
they're going in.

24:41.097 --> 24:46.600
I'm not anticipating one
or the other, but what's
in my big backyard.

24:47.470 --> 24:50.304
So all my cams are out.

24:50.340 --> 24:53.441
And, uh, it's time for
me to head back and
let them do their job.

25:05.588 --> 25:08.756
JESSIE: I'm no stranger to
doing things the hard way.

25:18.835 --> 25:22.169
<i> NARRATOR: Jessie and</i>
<i> his sled dogs rely on the</i>
<i> Nenana River for water</i>

25:22.205 --> 25:24.638
<i> they need to</i>
<i> survive dark winter.</i>

25:24.741 --> 25:28.476
<i> But thin ice blocked his</i>
<i> access to the river and</i>
<i> he must find a new path to</i>

25:28.511 --> 25:30.411
<i> harvest the lifeblood</i>
<i> of the Arctic.</i>

25:33.483 --> 25:35.983
JESSIE: You always
need a backup plan when
it comes to something

25:36.018 --> 25:37.718
as important as water.

25:37.754 --> 25:42.189
I'm gonna go figure out
a trail through the woods
to go down to the river.

25:48.464 --> 25:50.965
All right. Well,
here's the end of the line.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.834
Here's where I'm gonna have
to punch a trail in through.

25:54.437 --> 25:57.505
This is, uh, the reason
I'd like to be using the
slough, so I don't have to

25:57.540 --> 25:59.106
go through all this stuff.

25:59.142 --> 26:01.976
But until this freezes up, I
gotta come up with a solution.

26:02.011 --> 26:06.280
So I got about 100 yards
of trail I'm gonna have to
cut to get to the river.

26:10.520 --> 26:14.522
These are the kind
of challenges that you run
into out here just trying

26:14.557 --> 26:17.124
to get some water.

26:17.360 --> 26:20.161
It's a lot of work to
get water but there's no
other choice around here.

26:20.196 --> 26:23.931
You can't just turn on a tap
and fill up your buckets.

26:25.535 --> 26:30.104
Once I do this, I'll have two
options, to get down to the
river to get my water and, uh,

26:30.139 --> 26:34.775
that's gonna make things go
smoother in the future, which
is the whole point of this,

26:34.811 --> 26:38.979
is getting ahead of
everything so I can get
my water efficiently.

26:50.259 --> 26:52.426
So right here is
the Nenana River.

26:52.462 --> 26:54.595
It's looking pretty rough
and jumbled ice there.

26:54.630 --> 26:56.263
So hopefully the ice
is nice and strong.

26:56.299 --> 26:57.832
I can get out there and
put my water hole in.

26:57.867 --> 27:01.902
I can surely make it
down this, I don't know
how I'd make it back up

27:01.938 --> 27:03.337
with a bunch of water.

27:03.372 --> 27:05.306
So I'm gonna have to
build a ramp here.

27:05.341 --> 27:08.476
Dig a bunch of snow
and brush and make a nice
little bank going up here,

27:09.145 --> 27:12.546
kind of an angle so I can
make it up with my water.

27:13.716 --> 27:16.851
Some of this brush and
build this up a little bit.

27:17.420 --> 27:19.887
Well, I'm figuring if I
can get this snow and this
brush and some water on

27:19.922 --> 27:22.656
it that it'll hopefully
firm up tonight.

27:22.692 --> 27:26.327
What started out looking
like a big major setback,
I just figured out a way

27:26.362 --> 27:27.895
to work my way around it.

27:27.930 --> 27:31.665
But sometimes you just
got to muscle through it
and do it the hard way.

27:37.073 --> 27:42.042
Trying to go real nice
and slow and let the weight of
that snow machine set that in.

27:42.078 --> 27:46.180
Got to pay for water,
other places here, you
just pay for it in work.

27:49.118 --> 27:50.284
It's getting late here.

27:50.319 --> 27:51.619
It's clearing off the sky.

27:51.654 --> 27:53.354
It's gonna get cold tonight.

27:53.389 --> 27:58.092
So I wanna get this built
up here and I'll settle that
snow right down and ice it up.

28:02.431 --> 28:05.332
This isn't the easiest
way to go about it but
that's what you got to do

28:05.368 --> 28:06.934
out here to get by.

28:06.969 --> 28:11.138
You got to work late into the
night, early in the morning.

28:11.140 --> 28:12.373
Never give up.

28:12.408 --> 28:15.276
Just keep thinking,
innovative.

28:15.311 --> 28:21.448
Use what's at your
fingertips like snow,
brush, water, and ice.

28:29.925 --> 28:32.326
I'm gonna let the cold
temperatures do its
work on this tonight.

28:32.361 --> 28:34.028
This will firm this ramp up.

28:34.063 --> 28:36.830
I'll come down here with all
my supplies in the morning,
ready to build a permanent

28:36.866 --> 28:40.434
waterhole that I'll
be able to get water out
of for the whole winter.

28:40.469 --> 28:42.002
I'm almost there.

28:42.038 --> 28:45.472
Just one more night
I got to wait and let the
temperatures do its work

28:45.508 --> 28:48.609
and we'll be in the
water business tomorrow.

28:49.445 --> 28:51.512
Time to head home.

28:53.950 --> 28:56.083
ANDY: This life up here is
nothing but work, work, work.

28:56.151 --> 28:57.518
Plan, plan, plan.

28:57.553 --> 29:00.588
And, uh, quite a bit of
struggle thrown in between.

29:10.166 --> 29:13.150
<i> NARRATOR: In Eagle, Andy</i>
<i> is searching for caribou.</i>

29:13.202 --> 29:17.538
<i> A food source he</i>
<i> desperately needs after not</i>
<i> harvesting a moose last fall.</i>

29:18.341 --> 29:20.674
<i> But caribou herds</i>
<i> migrate quickly.</i>

29:20.710 --> 29:23.711
<i> And he must locate</i>
<i> them before the animals</i>
<i> disappear from the region.</i>

29:24.880 --> 29:27.881
ANDY: Everything out here
is about doing things
with proper timing.

29:27.917 --> 29:30.384
When the timing's right,
things go good.

29:30.419 --> 29:33.087
When the timing's wrong,
you work twice as hard.

29:34.223 --> 29:36.223
I'm hoping the timing's
gonna be right.

29:36.258 --> 29:39.627
And, uh, I can go
find some fresh meat.

29:40.963 --> 29:43.697
Oh, okay.

29:43.733 --> 29:48.402
Well, looks like
the water took out my
entire trail downriver.

29:49.238 --> 29:52.573
I managed to find a
little bit of snow tight
to the bank coming up.

29:52.608 --> 29:55.909
But I gotta get across this
'cause I'm at a pinch point.

29:56.278 --> 30:00.047
I can't stay against
the shoreline any
longer right now.

30:00.082 --> 30:03.717
And it gets too steep
to run along that, I'd
just tip over sideways into

30:03.753 --> 30:05.719
a bunch of overflow.

30:05.755 --> 30:10.257
So, the only thing between
me and caribou right now is
little bit of overflow and

30:10.292 --> 30:11.458
some thin ice.

30:11.527 --> 30:14.528
So I think I'm just
gonna take a chance.

30:14.563 --> 30:17.531
I think I'm just gonna
try and cross right here
and hope that this ice is

30:17.566 --> 30:19.299
strong enough to support me

30:19.335 --> 30:22.236
until I can get
out to that jumble ice.

30:22.271 --> 30:25.739
Whenever I'm a little bit
nervous, the best thing to do
is drive where there's some

30:25.775 --> 30:28.409
jumble ice 'cause
that's where the ice is
gonna be the thickest.

30:29.078 --> 30:32.513
Your best friend when
you get in overflow
is speed and momentum.

30:32.548 --> 30:36.050
Without speed and momentum,
that's when you get stuck.

30:41.323 --> 30:44.358
Woo. The hunt is on.

30:45.695 --> 30:48.562
This is the one
time of year when I'm
traveling the river,

30:48.597 --> 30:50.164
when it's forming new ice,

30:50.199 --> 30:54.068
I always have this
kinda burning gut, really
nervous feeling whenever

30:54.103 --> 30:56.203
I'm on the ice.

30:56.238 --> 30:59.840
I'm always alone when
I'm traveling so I gotta
be extra cautious here.

30:59.875 --> 31:03.577
I can't be stupid but
at the same time I don't
wanna give up too easy.

31:06.916 --> 31:08.916
Caribou, dead ahead.

31:13.389 --> 31:16.890
I think they heard me
coming this way, they're
kinda looking this way.

31:17.993 --> 31:21.929
I'm gonna draw back down
this way and try and
get into the willows.

31:21.964 --> 31:25.699
And walk through those
willows and try and
get closer to them.

31:31.774 --> 31:35.309
Caribou, right up on the bend.

31:48.274 --> 31:50.924
ANDY: Caribou,
right up on the bend.

32:02.121 --> 32:04.588
That sounded like a hit to me.

32:04.623 --> 32:07.991
I didn't see him go down but
it sounded like it hit him.

32:08.027 --> 32:10.727
We'll see where he's at.

32:17.436 --> 32:18.969
Oh, yeah, there he is.

32:19.004 --> 32:21.305
All right. He's down.

32:21.340 --> 32:24.007
Down and dead.

32:24.043 --> 32:27.344
Oh, that's a
nice-looking caribou.

32:27.613 --> 32:30.280
That's a nice one.

32:30.616 --> 32:34.384
Looks like a front
shoulder into the heart.

32:34.587 --> 32:37.121
That's why he was
bleeding out so good.

32:37.156 --> 32:39.790
Even though I've
been hunting for 30 years,
it's still exciting as hell

32:39.825 --> 32:41.992
when you know you
got some meat down.

32:42.027 --> 32:44.995
It's a good feeling.

32:45.197 --> 32:47.431
This is what you
call dead weight.

32:47.466 --> 32:50.501
For a lot of people,
a 401(k) is security.

32:51.137 --> 32:53.604
For me, dead animal on
the ground is security.

32:53.639 --> 32:57.107
It means I'm gonna eat
and I'm gonna eat good.

33:03.015 --> 33:05.949
Ah, get this baby
loaded up and get home.

33:07.920 --> 33:11.855
Two of the most important
things that I do all
year is fish for my dogs and

33:11.891 --> 33:14.024
get meat for myself
for the year.

33:15.494 --> 33:18.929
Not getting the moose
this year, it really weighed
heavy on my mind because

33:18.964 --> 33:21.498
that's security for me.

33:21.567 --> 33:23.967
And so, when I heard
that there were
caribou in the area,

33:24.069 --> 33:27.371
I got pretty excited 'cause
it was getting pretty important
to get some more meat.

33:28.841 --> 33:31.775
I don't think
that'll go anywhere.

33:32.044 --> 33:34.044
I was up all last night
building the sled.

33:34.079 --> 33:36.079
I only slept an hour or two.

33:36.115 --> 33:38.215
Got up about 4:00 A.M.

33:38.250 --> 33:40.250
so I could start
getting upriver.

33:40.286 --> 33:43.654
So I've been at it
for about 24 hours right
now and I'm feeling

33:43.689 --> 33:46.390
pretty tired so, good day.

33:46.425 --> 33:48.692
Time to get home.

33:51.964 --> 33:55.399
SUE: As long as
you can take the time, the
tundra's going to provide.

33:55.634 --> 33:58.869
Everywhere you go,
life finds a way.

34:07.046 --> 34:10.013
What I wanna do, I
got a storm coming in.

34:10.049 --> 34:13.684
So I wanna check
these game cams, see
if I caught anything.

34:16.222 --> 34:18.155
I got these to be extra eyes.

34:18.190 --> 34:21.792
It's not always that I'm
looking for something
and expecting something

34:21.827 --> 34:23.093
to jump out at me.

34:23.128 --> 34:25.596
I'm looking for anything
that doesn't belong.

34:25.631 --> 34:27.164
Anything out of the ordinary.

34:27.199 --> 34:29.299
And then animal patterns.

34:29.535 --> 34:32.169
Let's see what we got.

34:33.806 --> 34:36.773
I see prints right there,
there, there, there, there.

34:37.309 --> 34:39.209
This one says eight.

34:39.445 --> 34:43.714
So it didn't get much action,
but it did get action.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.818
All right. This
is my furthest one out.

34:48.153 --> 34:51.622
So now I'll make my way
back in getting the rest.

35:00.299 --> 35:02.299
Oh, there's wolverine track.

35:02.334 --> 35:05.936
The snow is starting to cover
it but it's not there yet.

35:05.971 --> 35:08.272
Here we go.

35:08.807 --> 35:12.643
What I saw wolverine
tracks coming in, all
manner of tracks in here.

35:12.678 --> 35:15.679
I hope I got a lot.

35:15.914 --> 35:19.583
There it is. All right.

35:21.320 --> 35:23.787
Now I can get out
and get that one.

35:23.822 --> 35:28.058
Wanted to park a little back,
see if I could see any tracks.

35:28.294 --> 35:31.295
I don't see any
obvious tracks here.

35:33.699 --> 35:38.635
And just like I had hoped,
it's protected from the
snow and whatnot in here.

35:38.871 --> 35:41.104
Twenty-three hits.

35:41.140 --> 35:44.174
So again, that's a
pretty good amount.

35:49.982 --> 35:53.784
I got my game cams,
so let's see what they
saw that I didn't.

35:54.586 --> 35:56.687
What's that?

35:56.922 --> 35:57.954
Oh, look at that!

35:57.990 --> 36:00.057
That little foxy.

36:00.092 --> 36:02.326
Well, little foxy certainly
is curious about it.

36:04.897 --> 36:06.930
Oh, he is messing with it.

36:06.965 --> 36:09.533
Look at, he's bouncing it.

36:09.735 --> 36:11.501
You leave that camera alone.

36:11.537 --> 36:12.669
What are you getting?

36:12.705 --> 36:13.970
Oh, he's getting snow.

36:14.006 --> 36:15.772
He's getting snow for water.

36:15.808 --> 36:19.242
I was unaware that they
would stockpile snow.

36:19.278 --> 36:22.245
It's not like it's a real
limited commodity out here.

36:22.548 --> 36:23.747
Interesting.

36:23.782 --> 36:25.282
Okay, I see an image here.

36:25.317 --> 36:26.550
Look at that.

36:26.585 --> 36:28.218
I almost didn't see
it, it's a ptarmigan.

36:28.253 --> 36:29.552
How well hidden is that?

36:29.555 --> 36:31.321
And he's just sitting there.

36:31.357 --> 36:32.956
Hi, ptarmy.

36:32.991 --> 36:34.958
Look at them all.

36:35.160 --> 36:37.744
Well, this definitely
looks like maybe where I
wanna set up a blind and be

36:37.796 --> 36:39.863
waiting for the ptarmys.

36:39.965 --> 36:42.199
Oh, look at him.

36:42.234 --> 36:43.767
What is he doing?

36:43.802 --> 36:46.169
Scuttling around.

36:46.205 --> 36:49.740
He says, "Yup, I'm going over
here." I'm very pleased with
what I'm catching so far.

36:51.076 --> 36:53.643
It did exactly what
I asked it to do.

36:53.679 --> 36:55.912
They were sensitive enough
to catch a lot of the birds.

36:55.981 --> 36:57.481
They got the foxes.

36:57.516 --> 37:00.484
It's a welcome addition
to the perimeter check.

37:03.856 --> 37:06.156
JESSIE: Opportunity
is something you got
to seize up here.

37:06.191 --> 37:08.959
You wait one second,
it's one second too late.

37:14.400 --> 37:18.602
Dog food, will get one
last stir and that'll
be done when I get back.

37:19.705 --> 37:23.874
It's about the last of the
water I got so the timing
is now to get some more and.

37:25.411 --> 37:28.545
It takes about 40 gallons
a day for me to run the
homestead around here,

37:28.580 --> 37:31.548
and most of that water
goes into keeping my dogs
hydrated and feeding them

37:31.583 --> 37:33.316
good, moist, warm food.

37:33.352 --> 37:36.820
Very good hydration
is critical to
a healthy sled dog.

37:38.557 --> 37:41.024
Time to head down
there and see how the
ramp's doing and, uh,

37:41.059 --> 37:43.727
check the ice and start
getting some water.

38:01.613 --> 38:04.614
All right.
This is the ramp
I put in last night.

38:04.650 --> 38:06.249
There was a drop off here.

38:06.285 --> 38:09.119
There was no way I could
have possibly got the water
buckets up there safely on

38:09.154 --> 38:12.656
the sled but, uh, this
thing is froze up and
set up nice overnight.

38:14.059 --> 38:16.460
Super hard, super gradual.

38:16.495 --> 38:20.363
Gonna head over here and
fill up my water buckets
and give it its first try.

38:32.578 --> 38:34.444
That's hard.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.813
That's soft.

38:39.451 --> 38:41.685
Damn, that's pretty deep.

38:41.720 --> 38:44.287
No way that snow
machine's going over here.

38:44.323 --> 38:48.725
So, I'm gonna put the water
hole here pretty close
so I can carry the buckets.

38:51.797 --> 38:55.165
Right now, I'm just trying to
cut it out without punching
through so I don't spray a

38:55.200 --> 38:57.434
bunch of water over myself.

38:57.469 --> 39:00.086
So I'll get the
outline of the cut.

39:05.210 --> 39:07.944
All right.
So that was pretty easy
to get through right there.

39:08.247 --> 39:11.581
Gotta pop this big
piece of ice out.

39:19.358 --> 39:22.559
Take my gloves off for this
so I don't get my gloves wet.

39:22.594 --> 39:26.196
Enough ice to hold my weight,
but not enough to hold
the snow machine's weight.

39:26.231 --> 39:30.300
Now I just gotta go get my
buckets and fill them up and
take them back to the sled and

39:30.335 --> 39:33.220
then take them home.

39:36.708 --> 39:39.442
You're either working for
water one way or another.

39:39.545 --> 39:42.412
You're either going to work
to pay the water bill or
you're working to come get

39:42.514 --> 39:45.015
it out of the river yourself.

39:45.951 --> 39:48.652
This is the kind
of work I enjoy.

39:48.887 --> 39:51.688
It's not what I had
planned necessarily, but
you got to work with what

39:51.723 --> 39:53.857
the conditions are.

39:53.892 --> 39:56.893
And the ice is still
pretty thin, so I'll
be thankful to have this

39:56.929 --> 39:58.929
waterhole right here.

39:58.964 --> 40:01.831
I don't really wanna
go any further out.

40:05.237 --> 40:07.003
All right, so I got
my sled loaded up.

40:07.039 --> 40:09.739
Now, I just gotta get
it home and get it unloaded
and get back down here and

40:09.775 --> 40:14.544
get some more and, uh,
put a little lid over my
hole so it won't freeze.

40:15.247 --> 40:19.416
Just take it nice
and easy, that way, I
don't spill nothing.

40:25.290 --> 40:27.524
CHIP: There's everything
you possibly need
that we can make a living

40:27.559 --> 40:29.593
from around here.

40:38.770 --> 40:41.805
AGNES: Today, Chip and
I is out here checking
our traps and, uh,

40:41.840 --> 40:44.307
it's just a lot
colder of a day.

40:44.359 --> 40:48.311
We have a stiff wind
going and, uh, it's kinda
chilly out here actually.

40:52.384 --> 40:53.917
AGNES: Oh, look!

40:53.952 --> 40:56.553
CHIP: Yup. Behind the
bush that's a fox.

40:57.489 --> 40:58.622
Right.

40:58.657 --> 41:01.224
You need to aim about
a foot above him.

41:01.493 --> 41:03.059
He's getting ready to run.

41:09.434 --> 41:11.668
CHIP: Oh, man that was close.

41:13.605 --> 41:15.572
You can't do a 200-yard
shot with a .22.

41:15.607 --> 41:16.973
AGNES: Yeah.
CHIP: That's not
going to work.

41:17.009 --> 41:18.808
AGNES: Yup.
CHIP: Way too far for a .22.

41:18.844 --> 41:20.910
AGNES: Hopefully, it'll just
go get stuck in our trap.

41:20.946 --> 41:22.912
That way, I don't have
to put a hole in it.

41:22.948 --> 41:25.615
CHIP: She got pretty close,
but we've got traps to check.

41:25.651 --> 41:27.951
Let's get to going, huh?

41:33.291 --> 41:35.191
Nothing in that one and
nothing in this one.

41:35.227 --> 41:36.493
AGNES: Hmm?

41:36.528 --> 41:38.161
CHIP: But the ravens
are following us.

41:38.196 --> 41:39.396
I saw two of them just
a little while ago.

41:39.431 --> 41:40.830
And this is just
the beginning of it all,

41:40.866 --> 41:42.565
so I need to go get more
traps and I need to go make

41:42.601 --> 41:44.668
more sets and more
sets and more sets.

41:44.703 --> 41:46.002
Well, you wanna go home?

41:46.038 --> 41:48.405
AGNES: Yup.
CHIP: All right.

41:49.474 --> 41:51.041
I'm pretty happy with
the sets I've got.

41:51.076 --> 41:53.043
Pretty soon the
animals will find out
where these things are.

41:53.078 --> 41:55.011
And, uh, they'll
start to produce.

41:55.047 --> 41:58.915
It may not happen today, it
may not happen tomorrow but
I'm just gonna keep checking.

41:58.950 --> 42:00.550
And this is just
the beginning of it all so,

42:00.585 --> 42:02.686
we've got a lot
to look forward to on
this trapping season.

42:02.721 --> 42:07.290
We just gotta give it time
and um, time's gonna happen.

42:09.895 --> 42:13.630
JESSIE: I have to get out of
my comfort zone and get more
into the technological era.

42:13.665 --> 42:15.532
I mean I'm kind of a
primitive dude, you know?

42:15.567 --> 42:18.101
I like the simple
things in life.

42:24.142 --> 42:26.643
Just putting the finishing
touches on my door here.

42:29.915 --> 42:32.048
It's just basically
an insulated box.

42:32.084 --> 42:35.552
If I can keep the
air temperature from
getting into the ice,

42:35.587 --> 42:38.555
then it's gonna keep
it from freezing
so much underneath,

42:38.857 --> 42:41.257
so I don't have to do
as much maintenance.

42:41.526 --> 42:43.693
Less time chipping ice,
more time running dogs.

42:43.729 --> 42:45.962
That's what I'm
trying to accomplish.

42:48.500 --> 42:51.451
Thing I like about this,
it's very nice and simple.

42:52.003 --> 42:56.506
Just like that, my water hole
is protected from the cold.

42:57.943 --> 43:00.910
Now I can go home and,
uh, feed the dogs and
have plenty of water.

43:02.981 --> 43:05.782
Good day to get this done
because I was out of water.

43:06.151 --> 43:09.252
I used the last of the water
this morning for the dog food
cooker and now I'm gonna have

43:09.287 --> 43:12.122
plenty of water, 250
gallons' worth of water.

43:12.524 --> 43:15.058
That's a lot of water,
last me all week.

43:24.536 --> 43:28.204
So I can tell you,
I've had to work way harder
to get water in the past and

43:28.240 --> 43:32.742
I'm pretty happy with,
uh, the new system, with the
snow machine, really helps.

43:33.879 --> 43:36.346
I don't have to bother
hooking up the dogs for that.

43:36.381 --> 43:39.949
We can focus our efforts
more on our training.

43:40.352 --> 43:44.353
For me, the snow machine
is just a tremendous resource
and it's gonna really help me

43:44.422 --> 43:48.658
maximize on the most important
things in my life like
getting wood, getting water,

43:49.461 --> 43:53.463
packing down trails,
breaking trails, going setting
up camps ahead of the dogs

43:53.498 --> 43:55.698
instead of using the dogs
for these things.

43:55.734 --> 43:58.835
That way, I can get
more time and focus on
just running the dogs.

43:59.304 --> 44:01.704
The snow machine's
really gonna unlock a
lot of things for me.

44:01.740 --> 44:04.340
'Cause I mean it's endless
what I can do with that.

44:04.543 --> 44:10.713
I'm all about bettering
my process so I can get more
efficient and I can do more.

44:15.921 --> 44:20.473
ANDY: You learn the
timing when you live
out in the woods.

44:24.846 --> 44:27.947
Oh, there's my lucky caribou.
And the only way you
learn that is by failure.

44:29.217 --> 44:30.717
Ah, what a long day.

44:30.752 --> 44:33.586
I built this sled last night.

44:33.622 --> 44:36.656
Slept about two hours.

44:36.692 --> 44:38.458
Got up, went down the river.

44:38.493 --> 44:43.797
I was out on the jumble ice
and I spotted a bunch of
caribou and I was able to

44:43.832 --> 44:46.433
knock down this girl.

44:47.135 --> 44:49.336
I got a lot of
processing to do.

44:49.371 --> 44:55.308
I'm gonna turn this into,
uh, steaks, jerky, sausage,
ground meat, trapping bait.

44:57.579 --> 45:02.582
Pretty much every part of this
animal is usable whether it's
something practical for me to

45:02.617 --> 45:06.319
use for a tool, uh, my dogs
to get some extra nutrition.

45:07.989 --> 45:10.457
Everything on a caribou
is really usable.

45:10.492 --> 45:13.593
It's a great, great
resource out here.

45:14.863 --> 45:18.832
Well, this year,
I didn't get a moose so this
caribou is probably more

45:18.867 --> 45:21.935
important this year than it's
been in many, many years.

45:22.904 --> 45:26.906
It's a lot of work to do all
this, to build a sled, to go
out there to fight overflow.

45:26.942 --> 45:28.908
But this meat is the payoff.

45:29.411 --> 45:31.878
This is just the tip
of the iceberg for me.

45:31.913 --> 45:34.948
This is just my first of many,
many meals from this caribou.

45:37.219 --> 45:42.122
Living out in this country,
caribou, moose, salmon, none
of that gets delivered to you.

45:42.991 --> 45:45.859
The only reason you get
what you get out here
is you put the effort.

45:45.894 --> 45:47.394
The perseverance.

45:47.429 --> 45:49.462
Sometimes the suffering.

45:49.498 --> 45:54.567
I have to think, plan,
and work for the food
in a different way

45:55.170 --> 45:56.736
than most people do.

45:56.772 --> 45:59.672
Most importantly the
satisfaction of knowing
that I can go out,

45:59.708 --> 46:04.210
I can get what I need to
live the life that I wanna
live here at Calico Bluff,

46:05.080 --> 46:09.048
this is the payoff
for all that work and I'd do
it 100 times over to get a

46:09.084 --> 46:11.818
good piece of meat like this.

46:12.053 --> 46:16.756
So, there's nothing
better than fresh meat
after a hard day's work.

46:18.860 --> 46:21.795
Oh man, it's so good.
