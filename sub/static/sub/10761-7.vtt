00:15.400 --> 00:17.300
I love it when he plays the piano.

00:17.400 --> 00:19.200
No matter how gloomy it is outside,

00:19.500 --> 00:21.400
it makes everything seem
a little brighter.

00:21.700 --> 00:25.000
I feel the same way about bacon.

00:25.300 --> 00:27.300
DAPHNE:
You're so lucky to be musical.

00:27.600 --> 00:30.200
I'd give my right hand to be able
to play the piano the way you do.

00:30.500 --> 00:32.700
Hmm, sounds a bit like O. Henry
meets Stephen King.

00:32.900 --> 00:35.800
But still, if you're serious,
I'd be willing to give you lessons.

00:36.100 --> 00:37.300
I'd love that.

00:37.600 --> 00:39.300
I've wanted to play
ever since I was little,

00:39.600 --> 00:42.700
and my family would sing rugby songs
after my brothers' matches.

00:42.900 --> 00:45.700
I can still see them
all muddied and bloodied,

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
belting out songs
like "The Old She-Crab"

00:48.300 --> 00:49.700
and "I Like a Moose."

00:51.000 --> 00:52.700
Once,
one of Michael's teeth fell out

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
right in the middle
of "Four Old Whores."

00:57.100 --> 00:59.200
MARTIN: Hey, Fras,
how was your date last night?

00:59.400 --> 01:01.800
I'm having breakfast with you.
You do the math.

01:02.100 --> 01:04.200
- Ahem, coffee?
FRASIER: Please, thank you, Niles.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.200
Well, here's something
that'll cheer you up.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.100
Eight years ago today
I moved in with you.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.000
- Eight years? Ha, ha.
MARTIN: Ha, ha.

01:11.300 --> 01:13.300
- Are you sure?
- This is quite an anniversary.

01:13.600 --> 01:15.300
You weren't even with Lilith
for eight years.

01:15.600 --> 01:17.700
Please, Niles,
I hardly think it's the same thing.

01:17.900 --> 01:19.700
It's not that different.
If you were a woman,

01:19.900 --> 01:21.300
you'd be his common-law wife
by now.

01:21.600 --> 01:24.500
- Oh, well, now I don't think that's...
DAPHNE: And think about this.

01:24.700 --> 01:26.400
If that date had been
the perfect woman,

01:26.700 --> 01:29.700
you'd still have to be with her
nine years before you overtook him.

01:30.100 --> 01:32.400
Yes, and actually,
if you add the 18 years

01:32.700 --> 01:36.300
he spent at home prior to college,
well, they've been together 26 years.

01:37.100 --> 01:38.800
So we just missed
our silver anniversary?

01:39.000 --> 01:40.400
- All right.
- Yes, but good news,

01:40.700 --> 01:43.100
your 30th is pearl. Ha, ha.

01:43.400 --> 01:45.400
Well, I think
it's a remarkable accomplishment.

01:45.700 --> 01:48.200
Happy anniversary,
Dr. And Mr. Crane.

01:48.500 --> 01:50.200
NILES: Yes, here, here.
- Ha, ha.

01:50.500 --> 01:52.100
NILES:
Oh, here.

01:55.300 --> 01:57.400
I'm so sorry it didn't work out
with Lucy last night.

01:57.600 --> 02:01.300
But don't worry. I have tons
of other friends better than her.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.200
Well,

02:03.300 --> 02:06.500
thanks for starting at the bottom
and working your way up.

02:07.400 --> 02:08.699
- Hey, Roz. Dr. Crane.
FRASIER: Oh.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.400
- Hi, Daph. Hello, Dad.
- Oh, hey, Daphne.

02:11.700 --> 02:13.100
What, are you taking piano lessons?

02:13.300 --> 02:14.800
Yeah, Niles is gonna teach me.

02:14.900 --> 02:17.300
I'm so jealous.
I've always wanted to learn to play.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.800
- Well, why don't you sit in with us?
- Really?

02:20.100 --> 02:22.600
- Well, do you think Niles would mind?
- Of course not.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.700
And even if he does,
he's so polite you'll never know.

02:25.900 --> 02:28.400
Hi. I'd like to tell you
about our new frozen coffee drink,

02:28.600 --> 02:29.800
The Caffalanche.

02:30.100 --> 02:31.300
It comes in three flavours.

02:31.400 --> 02:35.000
Frosty Coffee, So Cocoa-Cold

02:35.400 --> 02:38.000
and Chilla-in-Vanilla.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.000
- I'll try the So Cocoa-Cold.
FRASIER: Ha, ha.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.600
Uh, black coffee, thanks.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.400
- I hate what's happened to coffee.
- Dad.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.300
Well, I'm just saying,
I'm a regular joe,

02:47.500 --> 02:49.900
- I like my joe regular.
- I like my joe regular. I know.

02:50.200 --> 02:52.400
What's wrong with plain, old coffee,
the way God made it?

02:52.700 --> 02:53.700
FRASIER:
Nothing.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
What is wrong, is subjecting me
to the same shopworn bellyaching

02:57.300 --> 02:58.600
every time you come in here.

02:58.900 --> 03:01.200
Well, excuse me for having an opinion
you don't agree with.

03:01.500 --> 03:03.700
I thought this was America.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.200
Oh, look, it is.

03:07.200 --> 03:09.700
I'm gonna get my coffee to go.

03:10.500 --> 03:12.400
That was a bit harsh, Dr. Crane.

03:12.700 --> 03:14.100
Eight years of the same complaints

03:14.300 --> 03:16.000
about the same things
in the same places.

03:16.300 --> 03:19.200
And I'll say, sometimes I think
he does it just to antagonize me.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.500
Just like an old married couple.

03:22.800 --> 03:23.900
It's cute, isn't it?

03:24.000 --> 03:25.400
Well, I got my black coffee.

03:25.700 --> 03:28.000
Of course, it was more expensive
than a whole meal used to be.

03:28.300 --> 03:31.600
Time was, you could get two eggs,
potatoes, choice of breakfast meat...

03:31.900 --> 03:34.600
And still get change back
from the nickel.

03:36.300 --> 03:37.600
Will you just take your coffee.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.700
See how he talks to me?

03:40.000 --> 03:42.900
- And on our anniversary too.
FRASIER: Oh.

03:46.100 --> 03:48.800
NILES: Now, I want you to position
your hands over the keyboard.

03:49.200 --> 03:52.500
Fingers relaxed, elbows loose.
Good.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.100
Okay, and shoulders low. Good, good.
How are we doing?

03:55.300 --> 03:57.600
- Fine.
- Okay, I guess.

03:57.900 --> 03:59.400
When do we get to press
on the keys?

03:59.600 --> 04:01.100
Whoa, whoa.

04:01.400 --> 04:02.500
We have a lot to learn first.

04:02.600 --> 04:04.600
It could be weeks
before we press down on the keys.

04:04.900 --> 04:06.300
I want to play a song.

04:06.500 --> 04:08.200
Yeah, isn't that why we're here?

04:08.400 --> 04:10.200
Well, all in due time. Here, wait.

04:10.300 --> 04:12.500
Just watch my hands
while I play a scale. Watch this.

04:15.300 --> 04:16.700

Pardon me, Niles,

04:16.899 --> 04:18.700
there was a programme
I planned on watching.

04:18.899 --> 04:21.399
Oh, of course. Uh, we'll continue
the lesson in Daphne's room.

04:21.700 --> 04:23.300
How can we learn without a piano?

04:23.500 --> 04:27.500
With these workbooks
and a box of adhesive stars.

Brr, that guy sure looks cold.

04:37.300 --> 04:39.600
What are we watching?

04:40.400 --> 04:43.900
I'm watching <i>Lost on a Mountain.</i>

04:44.100 --> 04:45.200
Ah...

04:45.400 --> 04:47.400
<i>It is not remarkable that Everest...</i>

04:52.000 --> 04:53.800
Yes.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.900
Well, they sure don't look lost.

04:59.200 --> 05:00.700
That's the search party.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.400
Oh.

05:05.200 --> 05:06.400
So who's lost?

05:06.700 --> 05:08.500
Apparently you are.

Is there nothing you do
that doesn't create some cacophony?

06:23.300 --> 06:25.800
Well, I didn't do it on purpose.
I was trying to be considerate.

06:26.100 --> 06:27.900
If you were,
you would have oiled that chair

06:28.100 --> 06:29.700
when it began squeaking
five years ago.

06:29.900 --> 06:32.800
Boy, I don't know what's got into you
but you've been a real jerk lately.

06:33.100 --> 06:34.500
You should watch TV
somewhere else.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.800
I should go elsewhere? I?

06:39.100 --> 06:40.100
Just what do you suggest?

06:40.400 --> 06:43.700
That I find, uh, a documentary bar
and watch it on their big screen?

You know what?
I am just going to go take a talk.

- All right, calm down.

10:27.100 --> 10:28.800
The important thing is
it didn't hit anyone.

10:29.100 --> 10:31.000
At least we have that.
But how do we explain this?

10:31.200 --> 10:34.000
We just tell them what happened
as clearly and rationally as possible.

10:34.200 --> 10:35.900
Right, right. Rational.

10:44.700 --> 10:46.200
Dad, I can explain.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.200
You threw my chair off the balcony?

10:48.500 --> 10:50.000
I'm so sorry. Just hear me out.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.700
- You crazy?
- I didn't mean to.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.400
Forget what it means to me,
you could've killed someone.

10:54.700 --> 10:58.800
- It was an accident!
- You said there are no accidents!

10:59.200 --> 11:00.200
Clearly I was wrong.

11:00.400 --> 11:02.200
I mean,
why on earth would I do such a thing?

11:02.500 --> 11:06.600
Because you've always been gunning
for that chair.

11:08.700 --> 11:10.800
I accidentally stain your carpet

11:11.100 --> 11:14.100

in this apartment I care about

You just have to loosen up.
I'll show you.

11:51.300 --> 11:53.900

It's just a little finger exercise.

- Ha, ha.

As for the material, I tracked down
the original manufacturer

19:53.700 --> 19:57.300

they made it, I had them reweave it.
