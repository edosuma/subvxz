13:28.208 --> 13:29.977
But, dad!

13:30.010 --> 13:32.946
Don't "but, dad" me!

13:32.980 --> 13:35.182
[Muffled giggling]

13:35.215 --> 13:36.449
You know, Bill Larson's boy Adam

13:36.483 --> 13:38.852
is going to be competing
in the game,

13:38.886 --> 13:41.855
and I don't want you
upstaged by him again.

13:41.889 --> 13:44.057
Why, that boy...

13:44.091 --> 13:47.360
Harold, look at me
when I'm talking to you!

13:47.394 --> 13:52.933
Adam is such a successful,
enterprising young man!

13:52.966 --> 13:55.302
Why can't you be more like him?

13:55.335 --> 13:57.270
Dad, I'm not Adam.

13:57.304 --> 14:00.840
Why don't you just look at me
for what I am?

14:06.513 --> 14:08.315
Yecch.

14:08.348 --> 14:12.285
Now, you're entering Leon's game
and that's final!

14:12.319 --> 14:14.187
But... but, dad!

14:14.221 --> 14:15.188
No, thanks, Adam.

14:15.222 --> 14:19.092
I was planning to work
on my Jeep all weekend.

14:19.126 --> 14:22.029
Oh, that's okay, Marvin.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.931
I mean, now that I think of it,

14:23.964 --> 14:26.433
we need to find someone
with a really hot car.

14:26.466 --> 14:31.338
Hey!
What do you mean?

14:31.371 --> 14:33.340
What do you call this?

14:33.373 --> 14:34.341
Oh, your Jeep?

14:34.374 --> 14:38.178
Well, I'm sure it was
all right in its day,

14:38.211 --> 14:40.113
but I don't know.

14:40.147 --> 14:44.952
Hey, my Jeep can outclass
any new car on the road!

14:44.985 --> 14:49.056
Pick you up
on Friday at 5:00.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.958
And not only that,

14:50.991 --> 14:55.395
but the game's a perfect chance
to get back at Adam.

14:55.428 --> 14:57.230
Goody-good.

14:57.264 --> 15:00.200
It's because of him that my
dad's always on my case.

15:00.233 --> 15:04.671
Sounds good, but what makes
you so sure we can win?

15:04.704 --> 15:06.439
[Click]

[Harp playing]

15:09.142 --> 15:10.944

15:10.978 --> 15:12.980
Just a little present
from my father.

[Squeals]

15:16.516 --> 15:18.351
[Opener clanks]

15:22.322 --> 15:24.124
Oh!

15:30.430 --> 15:33.666
It's got
a turbo-charged engine,

15:33.700 --> 15:37.304
observation bubble, telephone,

15:37.337 --> 15:40.107
everything we need.

15:40.140 --> 15:44.744
And best of all,
this baby right here!

15:44.777 --> 15:47.380
Solve any clue
in five seconds flat.

15:47.414 --> 15:50.183
Your dad bought you
all this stuff?

15:50.217 --> 15:52.385
Boy, if you don't win that game,
he's gonna kill you.

15:52.419 --> 15:55.188
Don't worry!
We'll win!

15:55.222 --> 15:57.324
You guys just meet me here
Friday night.

15:57.357 --> 15:59.292
And in conclusion,
this can be our chance

15:59.326 --> 16:02.329
to finally show those football
gorillas how real men compete!

16:02.362 --> 16:03.997
Wesley is right!

16:04.031 --> 16:07.334
Especially after what those guys
did to us at the debate!

16:07.367 --> 16:09.002
- All in favor?
- Aye!

16:09.036 --> 16:10.337
Motion carried!

[Belches]

16:19.746 --> 16:21.314
I don't know, Lavitus.

16:21.348 --> 16:22.782
I think a lot of us have better
things we could do

16:22.815 --> 16:23.783
on a Friday night.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.285
[Belches]

16:25.318 --> 16:26.686
Yeah.

16:26.719 --> 16:29.089
Just why the hell
should we bother?

16:29.122 --> 16:30.723
[Belches]

16:30.757 --> 16:32.192
Well, gentlemen,

16:32.225 --> 16:37.364
I'll give you one good reason.

16:37.397 --> 16:38.365
[Laughter]

16:38.398 --> 16:39.366
What a nerd!

16:39.399 --> 16:40.767
All: We're in!

[Shattering glass]

16:41.801 --> 16:42.769
[Laughter]

16:42.802 --> 16:45.505
And that's why we've got to
enter that game!

16:45.538 --> 16:48.308
If Lavitus and his animals
decide to play,

16:48.341 --> 16:49.709
I want to be there
and beat them!

16:49.742 --> 16:51.411
Oh, count me in!

16:51.444 --> 16:54.514
I'd like to get back
at those moron jocks!

16:54.547 --> 16:56.416
Right! Peggy and Lulu,
how about you?

16:56.449 --> 16:58.385
[Both giggling]

17:13.165 --> 17:15.402
What you doing, Harold?

17:15.435 --> 17:17.704
Ah, Lucille has an idea
I'm supposed to be

17:17.737 --> 17:20.440
on a new diet starting tomorrow.

17:20.473 --> 17:23.242
Oh.
An all-marshmallow diet?

17:23.276 --> 17:25.112
Come on, Melio.

17:25.145 --> 17:28.315
You know I can't go all night
without food.

17:28.348 --> 17:29.416
[Sighs]

17:29.449 --> 17:31.384
Just need an emergency stash.

17:31.418 --> 17:35.188
That's all.

17:35.222 --> 17:36.389
[Grunting]

17:36.423 --> 17:39.326
[Sighs]

17:39.359 --> 17:40.693
Come on, Melio.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.262
Give me a break, huh?

17:42.295 --> 17:43.796
Don't tell Lucille.

17:43.830 --> 17:47.800
My lips are sealed.

17:49.736 --> 17:53.173
Well, buddy, uh...

17:53.206 --> 17:55.408
[Yawns]

17:55.442 --> 17:56.476
Getting kind of late.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.245
Oh, yeah.
Hmm.

17:58.278 --> 18:01.681
I think you should go home.

18:01.714 --> 18:05.818
I mean, uh,
thanks for stopping by.

18:08.388 --> 18:09.356
Sweet dreams.

Thanks.

[Slam]

18:27.874 --> 18:29.842
Yeah.

18:29.876 --> 18:31.478
Bye-bye.

18:31.511 --> 18:35.315
Okay, Marvin'll pick us up
at your house in half an hour.

18:35.348 --> 18:36.449
Come on, let's go!

18:36.483 --> 18:37.817
Yeah, but, you know,

18:37.850 --> 18:39.286
having four or five people
on the team

18:39.319 --> 18:40.187
would be a lot better.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.255
I just wish we could
find one more guy.

18:42.289 --> 18:46.359
Adam!
You'll never believe it!

18:46.393 --> 18:48.928
I finally got a date.
She's right outside the door.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.198
Hey, no kidding, Don Juan.
That's great.

18:51.231 --> 18:52.499
Did you get the date
all by yourself?

18:52.532 --> 18:55.435
Not exactly.
My mother sort of fixed me up.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.337
- Terrific.
- Hey, super, Flynch.

18:57.370 --> 18:58.371
But we got to get going.

18:58.405 --> 19:00.707
I just stopped by to see
if you had any ideas

19:00.740 --> 19:02.342
of where we might be able to go.

19:02.375 --> 19:05.545
[Door squeaks]

19:05.578 --> 19:07.314
Yeah.
You're coming with us.

19:07.347 --> 19:08.315
Come on!

19:08.348 --> 19:11.451
But what about my date?

19:11.484 --> 19:13.720
Believe me, Flynch,
you'll thank us in the morning.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.422
Yeah!

19:42.782 --> 19:45.418
Now that we're all here,
we can begin.

19:45.452 --> 19:48.855
Candy and Sunshine and I
will be running the game

19:48.888 --> 19:50.290
from my apartment,

19:50.323 --> 19:53.793
henceforth to be known
as "Game Control."

19:53.826 --> 19:56.896
We'll be plotting your progress
on the game map.

19:56.929 --> 19:59.932
You must phone in
from each clue location

19:59.966 --> 20:02.435
so that we can keep track of you
at all times.

20:02.469 --> 20:05.705
[Watch beeps]

20:05.738 --> 20:07.807
It is now sunset.

20:07.840 --> 20:11.911
Candy and Sunshine will
distribute the first clue.

20:21.288 --> 20:24.957
[Quiet chatter]

20:30.062 --> 20:32.299
"The sea is reversed.

20:32.332 --> 20:35.835

Well, teams, good luck.

20:51.017 --> 20:54.387
I'll see you at the finish line.

20:56.756 --> 20:59.726
Wherever that may be.

21:01.394 --> 21:03.730
All right, men, huddle up.

Okay.

21:06.032 --> 21:08.435

Armpit.

21:08.468 --> 21:11.438
Now, we've always been the best
offensive line there is,

21:11.471 --> 21:14.073
and tonight we're going to
uphold that tradition.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.475
'Cause who are we?

Get in, get in!

Figure out that clue!
Get in!

21:33.493 --> 21:34.961

going to kill me.

- Will you come on?
- Flynch!

[Cheering and shouting]

21:53.112 --> 21:54.781
[Tires squeal]

22:03.923 --> 22:06.426
Okay, let's take this clue
one piece at a time.

22:06.459 --> 22:07.527
Now, what's the first sentence?

22:07.560 --> 22:10.096
"The sea is reversed."

22:10.129 --> 22:13.766
Okay, well, that could be
the ocean or the beach.

22:13.800 --> 22:16.569
But it says
the sea is reversed.

22:16.603 --> 22:19.406
Maybe that means we should go
away from the beach.

22:19.439 --> 22:22.141
[Sighs] Tch.

22:22.174 --> 22:25.578
I've got it!
I've got it!

22:25.612 --> 22:27.780
"The sea is reversed"

22:27.814 --> 22:32.018
means to take the words
"the sea" and reverse them.

22:32.051 --> 22:34.487
That way you get...
"sea the"!

22:34.521 --> 22:36.889
Yeah, but what's
the second part of the clue?

22:36.923 --> 22:41.461
"S.S. Itari
is mixed up and blind."

22:41.494 --> 22:43.396
- Huh.
- Mr. Chairman,

22:43.430 --> 22:46.899
regarding the portion
"S.S. Itari is mixed up,"

22:46.933 --> 22:50.102
I move that "mixed up" means
the letters in the word

22:50.136 --> 22:52.138
"S.S. Itari"
are scrambled up.

22:52.171 --> 22:53.873
Very good.

22:53.906 --> 22:56.809
But the clue says "S.S.
Itari is mixed up and blind."

22:56.843 --> 22:58.144
What does he mean by blind?

22:58.177 --> 23:00.747
Well, that's the simple part.

23:00.780 --> 23:03.983
Blind means to...
take out its eyes.

23:04.016 --> 23:05.852
"I"s! You get it?
You get it?

23:05.885 --> 23:06.853
Yeah!

23:06.886 --> 23:10.089
[Both squealing]

23:10.122 --> 23:12.892
There are two "I"s
in the word "S.S. Itari."

23:12.925 --> 23:16.963
Take the "I"s out!
Take the "I"s out!

23:16.996 --> 23:18.865
She's right!

23:18.898 --> 23:23.536
That leaves S-S-T-A-R.

23:23.570 --> 23:26.739
And that unscrambles
to form the word...

23:26.773 --> 23:29.976
Uh, stars?

23:30.009 --> 23:31.444
You're right!

23:31.478 --> 23:33.546
- Yeah!
- Hurrah!

23:33.580 --> 23:34.947
Blaylak, way to go!

23:34.981 --> 23:35.982
If you
put everything together,

23:36.015 --> 23:40.853
the clue reads,
"sea the stars."

23:40.887 --> 23:42.489
And there's
only one place I know

23:42.522 --> 23:44.023
you can see every star there is!

23:44.056 --> 23:45.492
The wax museum!

23:45.525 --> 23:47.159
A map to the stars' homes!

on Hollywood Boulevard!

Let's go!

23:58.037 --> 24:00.607
All the other teams
are way ahead of us!

24:00.640 --> 24:03.543
Yeah, Harold!

24:17.790 --> 24:21.794
Well, I suppose we
may as well get going.

24:21.828 --> 24:24.096
We don't want to make it too
late of a night now, do we?

24:24.130 --> 24:28.134

24:29.135 --> 24:30.870
Let's see.

Now, watch this.

it was coming from here.

started to complain,
