00:34.900 --> 00:37.200
Go, go, gadget go-go!

00:51.800 --> 00:53.700
I think this photo shoot
is premature, Jerry.

00:53.800 --> 00:56.300
We haven't even decided whether
we'll be a coffee company or a

00:56.400 --> 00:58.000
studio specializing in mermaid porn!

00:58.000 --> 00:59.600
Either way, we're gonna need a logo.

00:59.700 --> 01:02.700
Ooh, let's shoot the sexy one first!

01:08.600 --> 01:13.200
That model was someone's child, and she
died in a topless mermaid costume!

01:13.300 --> 01:14.200
It was an accident.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.400
That was a sign from God!

01:15.400 --> 01:17.000
We're not doing mermaid porn, got it?!

01:17.100 --> 01:18.800
Fine, fine, we'll do the coffee thing!

01:18.900 --> 01:21.100
But we still need a logo, and
photo shoots ain't cheap.

01:21.100 --> 01:23.300
We'll use this  in her memory.

01:23.400 --> 01:25.300
Uh... we'll crop it!

01:27.900 --> 01:31.100
That was the best 10" cube
of tofu I've ever had!

01:31.200 --> 01:34.800
I hope someday in the future,
everyone goes vegetarian.

01:35.700 --> 01:39.800
I am from the future -- a future
where everyone is vegetarian!

01:39.800 --> 01:40.600
Awesome!

01:40.600 --> 01:41.900
That's wonderful!

01:41.900 --> 01:43.400
You don't understand!

01:45.700 --> 01:46.200
Run!

01:46.300 --> 01:47.600
Hey, there, buddy.

01:47.700 --> 01:50.200
I'm one of the good one--

01:51.700 --> 01:55.000
So, you're saying with no
natural enemies, cows became

01:55.100 --> 01:59.300
Earth's dominant species, and since
cows don't know right from wrong...

01:59.300 --> 02:02.000
Cows became the ultimate
killing machines.

02:05.200 --> 02:06.900
Shoot the cow!

02:06.900 --> 02:09.900
I can't kill an animal!

02:09.900 --> 02:13.200
But I'll knock an animal
the [bleep] out!!

02:16.900 --> 02:18.300
Is that really necessary?

02:22.400 --> 02:23.800
Quickly! Eat this burger!

02:23.800 --> 02:27.300
It's the only way to avoid vegetarian
future and change the timeline.

02:27.400 --> 02:28.000
I can't!

02:28.100 --> 02:28.800
Trust me!

02:28.800 --> 02:30.400
I can't!!

02:30.500 --> 02:31.900
Time-out, guys. T.O.!

02:32.000 --> 02:33.700
I want to be real clear on this.

02:33.700 --> 02:37.200
You would die to avoid compromising
your vegetarian principles?

02:37.200 --> 02:38.500
Yeah, yeah, I would!

02:38.500 --> 02:40.100
Even if it means I die, too.

02:40.200 --> 02:43.000
Well, I mean, I-it's the
principle of the thing.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.700
And consequently, all
human beings on earth?

02:45.800 --> 02:47.100
What do you want me to say?!

02:47.100 --> 02:49.100
I want you to admit
it's not about meat.

02:49.200 --> 02:52.700
You're actually just a
narcissist and a contrarian, and

02:52.700 --> 02:56.000
being a vegetarian is about
setting yourself apart in order

02:56.000 --> 02:58.400
to feel superior to the rest of us!

02:58.400 --> 03:00.500
I -- I -- I -- fine.

03:00.600 --> 03:01.700
Give me the  burger.

03:01.700 --> 03:02.400
Mmm.

03:04.400 --> 03:05.500
You did it!

03:05.600 --> 03:07.300
You saved the human race!

03:07.400 --> 03:11.100
Oh, but I don't feel special
and superior anymore.

03:11.100 --> 03:15.700
I'm sure you'll find that thing that
makes you feel special again, Katie.

03:18.600 --> 03:22.800
What were you thinking, Sabrina, using
your magic to turn Harvey's hair purple?

03:22.900 --> 03:25.100
Here's a better question, aunt Hilda.

03:25.100 --> 03:27.700
If you know magic, why
are you still fat?

03:29.400 --> 03:31.400
Season-one callback, jerks!

03:31.500 --> 03:32.700
Whoo-hoo!

03:34.100 --> 03:37.400
Both: I feel the need,
the need for... speed!

03:37.400 --> 03:38.400
Dick!

03:38.400 --> 03:39.700
Eh, did you just say "dick"?

03:39.700 --> 03:42.300
No, I thought you said "dick."

03:49.500 --> 03:50.300
Meep-meep!

04:20.300 --> 04:21.600
Meep.

04:21.700 --> 04:24.800
Meep-meep.

04:38.100 --> 04:42.600
And now back to...
Hey, Evie, want to go out with me on Friday?

04:44.200 --> 04:45.800
Eh...Pass.

04:47.100 --> 04:49.800
V.E.N.O.M. will never
suspect that this ordinary

04:49.900 --> 04:52.100
gas station is really the
headquarters of our new

04:52.100 --> 04:54.600
high-tech crime-fighting team, M.A.S.K.

04:54.700 --> 04:56.000
I can't hear a word he's saying.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Gloria, can you hear Matt?

04:57.000 --> 04:58.400
Did you just call me fat?

04:58.500 --> 05:02.000
Okay, I know they look cool, but
there's no need to wear these inside.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.300
Come on. Masks off.

05:03.300 --> 05:04.500
Hey! Anyone here?!

05:04.600 --> 05:06.600
I think your -- your pump's broken!

05:06.700 --> 05:09.100
Now, I don't want to alarm
anybody, but the agents of

05:09.200 --> 05:11.400
V.E.N.O.M. already have
their acronym figured out.

05:11.500 --> 05:12.700
They're really up our asses.

05:12.700 --> 05:14.400
I'd like to get up Gloria's ass.

05:14.400 --> 05:15.300
What did you say?

05:15.400 --> 05:16.600
I said I hate V.E.N.O.M.!

05:16.700 --> 05:17.500
No, you didn't.

05:17.600 --> 05:22.000
You misheard me because of my mask.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.300
Hey, buddy! Get a move on!

05:23.400 --> 05:25.300
Well, it's not my fault, so lay off!

05:25.400 --> 05:27.300
Is he paying by check or something?

05:27.300 --> 05:30.600
Look, I can't find an attendant,
so what do you want me to do?!

05:30.600 --> 05:33.500
Mobile-attack...serial killers!

05:33.600 --> 05:35.100
Like we'll murder V.E.N.O.M.'s ass!

05:35.100 --> 05:36.100
You're not even trying!

05:36.200 --> 05:38.300
What if we just call ourselves
H.E.L.M.E.T. --

05:38.300 --> 05:42.600
The heroic, elite legion making...
elite...tacos.

05:43.500 --> 05:43.900
Uh-oh!

05:43.900 --> 05:45.500
It sounds like V.E.N.O.M.'s onto us.

05:45.600 --> 05:47.100
Bruce...you know what to do.

05:47.100 --> 05:49.100
Why's the freaking open sign on?

05:49.100 --> 05:51.700
I don't even think this
is a functioning pump!

05:51.700 --> 05:54.400
Here's my comment card, you [bleep]

05:54.500 --> 05:58.000
Say hello to Miles Mayhem... in hell!

06:01.700 --> 06:04.100
I just wanted a tank of gas!

06:04.200 --> 06:06.600
Oh, these are civilians.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.000
Think we better get used
to wearing these masks.

06:09.100 --> 06:11.800
The forces of H.E.L.M.E.T.
were never here.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.500
Talk! Talk, damn you!

06:13.500 --> 06:15.300
I ain't saying nothin'!

06:15.400 --> 06:16.400
Get my lawyer!

06:20.100 --> 06:21.900
No! Aah! Ow! Ow! All right!

06:21.900 --> 06:24.400
The body's buried near
the river, west of town!

06:24.500 --> 06:26.100
Good job, Officer Pixar Lamp!

06:27.300 --> 06:29.400
Thwip, thwip!

06:29.500 --> 06:33.700
Thwip, thwip... smash!

06:33.800 --> 06:37.600
Smash...

06:45.500 --> 06:46.500
Excelsior!

06:47.700 --> 06:51.300
Hey, that's called "character
branding," true believers!

06:51.300 --> 06:52.400
I invented it!

06:52.400 --> 06:58.300
Um, is that
really -- I said I invented it!

06:58.400 --> 06:59.400
Pull over, boy.

06:59.400 --> 07:03.200
Always in search of the perfect
ingredients for our gourmet brand of

07:03.200 --> 07:04.700
Orville Redenbacher popcorn!

07:04.700 --> 07:08.100
Once a corn man, always a corn
man, huh, grandpa Orville?

07:08.200 --> 07:11.500
Once a second banana, always
a second banana, Gary.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.200
Now stop this car.

07:14.300 --> 07:16.800
How's that corn lookin', grandpa?

07:16.900 --> 07:17.500
Wet.

07:24.800 --> 07:25.900
Sorry, son.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
At my age, it takes a while
to turn off the spigot.

07:35.900 --> 07:39.000
Now, what are you doing in the middle
of a cornfield all by yourself?

07:40.100 --> 07:44.900
The outsiders will be sacrificed to the
thing that dwells among the stalks!

07:45.800 --> 07:48.900
Son, you've got a choice --
either let us go or I'm gonna

07:48.900 --> 07:52.300
tie this bow tie around your
[bleep] right before I cut it off.

07:52.400 --> 07:53.600
Foolish old man!

07:53.700 --> 07:57.200
As long as I serve the thing
that dwells among the stalks, I

07:57.300 --> 07:58.600
shall live forever!

07:58.700 --> 08:00.100
Live forever, ah?

08:00.100 --> 08:03.900
That sure would come in handy
if the octogenarian face of a

08:04.000 --> 08:06.100
worldwide corporation ever died.

08:06.200 --> 08:12.000
You ever try and re-animate Mboy, I'll
rip your nuts off from beyond the grave!

08:13.100 --> 08:14.800
What are we gonna do, grandpa?

08:14.900 --> 08:17.200
We're trapped in the
cornfield with a demon!

08:17.200 --> 08:18.200
No, Gary.

08:18.200 --> 08:21.400
That demon's trapped in
a cornfield with me.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.400
Ow! Get it out, grandpa!

08:28.900 --> 08:31.200
Pop pop, mother [bleep]

08:38.100 --> 08:40.299
I'm a man of my word, Cyrus.

08:41.100 --> 08:42.900
Oh, n-o-o-o-o!

08:53.500 --> 08:54.200
Hey, there.

08:54.300 --> 08:56.000
How'd you like to --
Ew, get lost.

08:56.000 --> 08:56.700
Hey, there.

08:56.800 --> 08:59.300
How'd you like to --
I thought you were into spoons.

08:59.400 --> 09:00.600
I go both ways.

09:00.700 --> 09:04.500
And finally, Joes, "don't ask,
don't tell" has been abolished.

09:04.600 --> 09:09.300
So, chuckles, if there's anything
you'd like to tell us, I'm askin'!

09:09.300 --> 09:11.200
Oh, roadblock, you look different.

09:11.300 --> 09:13.800
Duke, I don't know what's
done me this harm!

09:13.900 --> 09:16.700
I woke up this mornin', me
and flint had switched arms!

09:16.800 --> 09:19.100
I can't touch Lady Jaye-- not with these!

09:19.200 --> 09:21.000
Oh, guys, I think I might be a racist.

09:21.100 --> 09:22.800
Snake eyes, what happened to you?

09:22.900 --> 09:25.600
You look like someone tried to
paint you like spider-man, then

09:25.700 --> 09:26.800
tossed you in the grass!

09:26.800 --> 09:29.000
Has this happened to anyone else?

09:29.100 --> 09:29.900
Scarlett?

09:29.900 --> 09:31.600
C-cover yourself, woman!

09:31.600 --> 09:32.700
Huh? Oh!!

09:32.800 --> 09:35.900
I don't know how Cobra's doing this,
but I'm damn well gonna find out!

09:35.900 --> 09:36.700
Yo, Joe!

09:36.800 --> 09:37.300
Cobra?!

09:37.300 --> 09:40.700
Put your checkbooks away 'cause
this one's coming out of your ass!

09:40.800 --> 09:43.900
Whatever voodoo you're using to
mangle us, we've had enough!

09:44.000 --> 09:45.700
My helmet's not made to come off!

09:45.800 --> 09:48.700
I look like Ebert under here,
and not Ebert in his prime!

09:48.800 --> 09:50.800
And what are you so surprised about?

09:52.900 --> 09:55.700
We removed this from
Dr. Mindbender's mouth!

09:55.800 --> 09:57.200
What's going on here?

09:57.300 --> 09:59.900
I want to see cobra commander now!

09:59.900 --> 10:04.100
I -- I couldn't
stop it -- a giant hand from the

10:04.200 --> 10:10.200
heavens taping me to what looked like
enormous, brightly colored dynamite!

10:10.300 --> 10:12.000
What kind of nonsense
are you blathering?

10:12.100 --> 10:14.000
Whoa! Oh, what did this?

10:14.100 --> 10:19.800
We're nothing, you see, playthings
that have bored our fickle God.

10:19.800 --> 10:21.900
It's judgment day!

10:24.000 --> 10:25.400
Duke! I'm scared!

10:25.500 --> 10:27.200
Don't worry, Scarlett.

10:27.200 --> 10:30.800
We'll find whoever -- or
whatever -- has done this to us!

10:34.700 --> 10:35.800
Oh, no!

10:35.900 --> 10:40.300
Please don't take my face--
my beautiful face!

10:43.500 --> 10:46.200
Got ya, you massive abomination!

10:46.300 --> 10:47.800
Yo, Joe!

10:47.800 --> 10:49.300
Uh, did we just kill a kid?

10:49.300 --> 10:52.500
I mean, yo, Joe, but I
think that was a kid.
