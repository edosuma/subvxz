WEBVTT

00:05.406 --> 00:07.375
Lost in a memory?

00:07.408 --> 00:10.811
Just thinking
about the future, actually.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.813
I can go anywhere
when this is over.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.315
Do anything.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.517
I need to get
a new Social Security number,

00:16.550 --> 00:17.985
but otherwise...

00:18.018 --> 00:19.520
I'm no one.

00:19.553 --> 00:22.556
-Where do you think you'll go?
-I don't know.

00:22.590 --> 00:24.225
Australia, maybe.

00:24.258 --> 00:26.860
I always loved
those Crocodile Dundee movies.

00:26.894 --> 00:29.197
The first one, at least.

00:29.230 --> 00:30.998
I'll figure it out...

00:31.031 --> 00:34.001
as soon as Margaret's dead
and can't hurt anyone again.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.736
Let's go back to the motel
until it gets dark.

00:35.769 --> 00:36.837
Then we can sneak in.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.572
Too risky during the daylight.

00:38.606 --> 00:41.409
But in the meantime,
you better start eating.

00:41.442 --> 00:43.577
Margaret's probably got
that "crazy person" strength,

00:43.611 --> 00:45.179
and you're gonna need
that kind of strength

00:45.213 --> 00:46.747
if you want to be
the final girl.

00:46.780 --> 00:48.048
-Final girl?
-(chuckles): Oh.

00:48.082 --> 00:49.583
That's right,
you missed the '80s.

00:49.617 --> 00:51.952
Every horror movie has
a final girl--

00:51.985 --> 00:54.588
the one who survives it all
and lives to tell the tale.

00:54.622 --> 00:57.358
As I see it,
that's either you or Margaret.

00:57.391 --> 01:00.794
-Why can't it be you?
-A black final girl?

01:00.828 --> 01:04.098
Sweetheart, they kill folks off
with my complexion first.

01:04.132 --> 01:05.633
I'm Stacey Phillips.

01:05.666 --> 01:08.102
Has anyone ever told you
that you look exactly like

01:08.136 --> 01:09.637
Brooke Thompson?

01:12.072 --> 01:13.607
Yeah, all the time.

01:13.641 --> 01:15.709
It's, like, why can't I look
like Michelle Pfeiffer?

01:15.743 --> 01:17.911
You guys up here
for the festival?

01:17.945 --> 01:19.247
Totally.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.948
STACEY:
I knew it. I heard there were

01:20.981 --> 01:22.916
Brooke and Jingles groupies,
but I've never met one.

01:22.950 --> 01:24.918
Your costume is incredible,
though I'm sure

01:24.952 --> 01:26.654
-it didn't take much effort.
-(Donna chuckles)

01:26.687 --> 01:28.656
I'm with the press.
National Enquirer.

01:28.689 --> 01:31.159
I know, most people think
we're a rag-- and we are--

01:31.192 --> 01:33.060
but it pays the bills.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.062
I write books mostly,
about serial killers.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.398
I did one on Bundy,
another on Ed Gein.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.733
It's funny, 'cause back in
the '70s, all anyone cared about

01:39.767 --> 01:42.236
was Bigfoot and aliens,
the Loch Ness Monster,

01:42.270 --> 01:44.972
all that Leonard Nimoy
In Search of... shit.

01:45.005 --> 01:48.075
But the '80s have been all about
serial killers, human monsters.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.777
My new book is
about Brooke and Jingles

01:49.810 --> 01:51.145
and the massacres
up at Camp Redwood.

01:51.179 --> 01:53.080
So morbid.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.682
Oh, morbid's where the money is.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.116
To me, that camp represents

01:56.150 --> 01:57.818
everything that's wrong
with the 1980s.

01:57.851 --> 02:01.121
A veneer of wholesomeness
covering a violent darkness.

02:01.155 --> 02:02.956
Have you been
to a high school lately?

02:02.990 --> 02:04.792
It's not John Hughes.
Kids are doing coke,

02:04.825 --> 02:06.194
bringing guns to school.

02:06.227 --> 02:07.861
All these clearly gay
British musicians

02:07.895 --> 02:10.030
pretending to be straight.
History's gonna look back

02:10.063 --> 02:11.865
at the '80s
as the era of bullshit.

02:11.899 --> 02:14.168
Honestly,
between Iran-Contra, AIDS,

02:14.202 --> 02:16.470
that TV show Small Wonder
and crack, I'm pretty sure

02:16.504 --> 02:19.507
the '80s are gonna be the end
of the world as we know it.

02:20.674 --> 02:22.176
Nice meeting you.

02:22.210 --> 02:24.345
Hopefully,
see you up at the camp.

02:24.378 --> 02:26.580
-Are you gonna finish that?
-All yours, sweetheart.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.185
She recognized me.
I know it.

02:31.219 --> 02:33.387
She can't recognize you.
You're dead.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.121
(music slows, distorts)

03:41.154 --> 03:42.423
(film projector clicking,
then shuts off)

03:48.629 --> 03:50.731
(intro to "Fading Fast"
by the Go-Go's playing)

03:50.764 --> 03:54.268
* You thought that
I was on your side *

03:57.338 --> 04:00.674
* That I'd do anything for you *

04:02.810 --> 04:04.044
(tires screech)

04:04.077 --> 04:06.747
* But you found out yesterday *

04:06.780 --> 04:08.582
* That you were wrong *

04:10.250 --> 04:11.485
* I opened up the... *

04:11.519 --> 04:12.653
You okay, man?

04:12.686 --> 04:14.254
You don't look so good.

04:14.288 --> 04:16.056
Redwood.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.158
I need to get to Camp Redwood.

04:18.191 --> 04:19.793
Good news, bro.

04:19.827 --> 04:21.795
You're almost there.
And lucky for you,

04:21.829 --> 04:24.064
I got a soft spot
for hitchhikers.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.299
Get in.

04:25.333 --> 04:27.134
Let's party.

04:28.536 --> 04:31.672
* I've never seen you *

04:31.705 --> 04:35.242
-(tires squeal)
-* You're someone I don't know *

04:35.275 --> 04:36.644
* Are you just *

04:36.677 --> 04:37.911
-* Another boy *
-Go-Go's fan?

04:37.945 --> 04:40.247
* That I met long ago? *

04:40.280 --> 04:42.416
-(turns off music)
-Yeah, me, neither.

04:42.450 --> 04:45.252
I don't go in
for that New Wave shit.

04:45.285 --> 04:47.988
The Eagles, man,
that's where I come out.

04:48.021 --> 04:49.256
CCR.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.624
Bob Seger.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.793
It's all about the storytelling,
you know?

04:52.826 --> 04:54.161
-Mm.
-(turns on radio)

04:54.194 --> 04:56.096
Wonder if we get reception
out here.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.197
Shit.

04:57.230 --> 04:58.866
What happened to your hands?

04:58.899 --> 05:00.468
(chuckles)
Yeah.

05:00.501 --> 05:02.770
Guess my hitchhiking
and arcade days are over.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.137
Chicks, man.

05:05.172 --> 05:06.774
What can I say?

05:06.807 --> 05:08.342
I like the feisty ones.

05:08.376 --> 05:10.378
(laughs)

05:10.411 --> 05:13.046
Meeting a couple
at the festival.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.716
They're a real good
fucking time.

05:15.749 --> 05:18.318
-("Fortunate Son" by Creedence
Clearwater Revival playing)
-Oh, there we go.

05:23.757 --> 05:26.059
(thumping, muffled shouts)

05:27.094 --> 05:29.062
Um, do you hear that?

05:29.096 --> 05:30.964
-(thumping continues)
-Hear what?

05:30.998 --> 05:32.800
WOMAN:
Let me out of here!

05:32.833 --> 05:34.535
Motherfucker!

05:34.568 --> 05:36.604
* Ooh, they're red,
white and blue... *

05:41.842 --> 05:43.577
We need to get you
to the hospital.

05:43.611 --> 05:44.678
WOMAN:
I got you.

05:44.712 --> 05:45.713
-I got you.
-Thank you.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.047
Okay. Here.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.949
(gasping)

05:53.687 --> 05:55.288
-(sizzles)
-(faint groaning)

05:57.357 --> 05:58.692
(exhales)

06:05.566 --> 06:08.201
We're trying to listen

06:08.235 --> 06:10.370
-to Creedence!
-(gasping, crying)

06:10.404 --> 06:13.073
Please, just let me go.

06:13.106 --> 06:14.542
I-I won't say anything.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.677
That's the best you can do?

06:16.710 --> 06:19.680
Seriously, I expect more

06:19.713 --> 06:21.915
out of Mary Kay.

06:21.949 --> 06:24.117
(sniffs)
I mean, you got this fancy car.

06:24.151 --> 06:26.854
Doesn't it make you, like,
a really good salesman?

06:26.887 --> 06:30.290
By the mid '90s,
Mary Kay will probably own

06:30.323 --> 06:32.225
half the real estate
in New York

06:32.259 --> 06:36.063
and all the fucking debt
of Latin America.

06:36.096 --> 06:39.600
Most of the cars on the road
will be pink.

06:39.633 --> 06:42.102
And the best you can do is,

06:42.135 --> 06:45.973
"Please, just let me go"?

06:47.675 --> 06:49.810
What would you say

06:49.843 --> 06:52.880
i-if I told you...
(breath trembling)

06:52.913 --> 06:55.382
that you could change...

06:55.415 --> 06:56.517
(grunts)

07:09.162 --> 07:10.430
MARGARET:
I have a question, Courtney.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.233
How long has it been

07:13.266 --> 07:15.402
since you first started
working for me?

07:15.435 --> 07:18.138
Four years,
three months, 15 days.

07:18.171 --> 07:20.073
Right. So then you would know,
when something bad happens,

07:20.107 --> 07:21.742
I like to be
the first to hear it.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.478
-Yes, mostly.
-So, why the hell

07:24.512 --> 07:26.680
did it take so long
for you to tell me

07:26.714 --> 07:29.416
that one of our headlining acts
has been murdered?!

07:29.449 --> 07:30.951
I was scared!

07:30.984 --> 07:32.820
My brain was frozen.

07:32.853 --> 07:34.287
I almost ran away.

07:34.321 --> 07:35.923
They're dead, Courtney.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.492
Kajagoogoo is dead!

07:38.526 --> 07:41.194
How can I trust you if I can't
count on you to keep your cool

07:41.228 --> 07:43.163
when something
very important happens?

07:43.196 --> 07:44.832
We have to call the police.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.466
They'll want
to collect evidence.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.536
Probably seal off the camp.

07:48.569 --> 07:50.604
Nobody's gonna want to come
out here when they find out

07:50.638 --> 07:52.472
musicians are being slaughtered.

07:52.506 --> 07:55.442
You're going to make
this nightmare disappear.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.811
You're gonna get yourself
a roll of plastic sheeting,

07:57.845 --> 08:00.981
a box of garbage bags,
a pair of good rubber gloves

08:01.014 --> 08:02.683
and a sharp butcher's knife,

08:02.716 --> 08:05.519
and you are going to get rid
of all of these bodies.

08:05.553 --> 08:07.855
(crying):
I c... I can't do that.

08:07.888 --> 08:10.357
I'm a small, diminutive man.

08:10.390 --> 08:11.959
Right. That's why
you're gonna cut them

08:11.992 --> 08:13.994
-into little tiny pieces.
-Oh!

08:14.027 --> 08:15.863
And you need to clean
every surface with bleach.

08:15.896 --> 08:18.031
This bus has to be immaculate!

08:18.065 --> 08:20.634
Not a single drop of blood
can be left.

08:20.668 --> 08:23.003
How can you be so cold
about this?

08:23.036 --> 08:25.138
Do you not have any empathy?

08:25.172 --> 08:28.341
(groans) Everything
is going to be okay, Courtney.

08:28.375 --> 08:30.077
Everyone is still coming.

08:30.110 --> 08:33.346
No one is going to miss
Kaja-fucking-googoo

08:33.380 --> 08:35.382
and their one hit single.

08:36.383 --> 08:37.918
Hop to it!

08:40.453 --> 08:42.590
(strained grunting)

08:47.294 --> 08:48.562
(grunts)

08:48.596 --> 08:51.699
("Too Shy" by Kajagoogoo
playing)

08:58.772 --> 09:01.208
(music continues)

09:09.482 --> 09:12.285
* Tied *

09:15.322 --> 09:17.457
We've never been tighter.

09:17.490 --> 09:19.259
* You're too shy, shy *

09:19.292 --> 09:23.496
* Hush, hush. *

09:32.840 --> 09:34.307
Hey, bro.

09:34.341 --> 09:35.575
You with the Idol crew?

09:35.609 --> 09:36.576
Yeah.

09:36.610 --> 09:38.612
What's in there?

09:41.181 --> 09:42.983
Billy's rings.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.819
No touching the silver.

09:45.853 --> 09:48.756
I got some of Steve's
guitar picks, though.

09:52.793 --> 09:55.195
Hey, man, who are you with?

09:56.363 --> 09:57.931
Satan.

09:57.965 --> 10:00.200
Right on.

10:06.006 --> 10:07.407
(grunts)

10:07.440 --> 10:09.442
* In the midnight hour *

10:09.476 --> 10:12.946
* She cries more,
more, more, mm *

10:12.980 --> 10:15.448
* With a rebel yell... *

10:15.482 --> 10:17.785
(grunting)

10:18.819 --> 10:20.253
Big Ben.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.122
I see you got my invitation.

10:22.155 --> 10:24.191
You never should've
gone after my family.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.259
I told you
there would be a price to pay

10:26.293 --> 10:27.627
if you ever fucked me over.

10:27.661 --> 10:29.196
Besides, I did you a favor.

10:29.229 --> 10:31.131
You forgot who you were.

10:31.164 --> 10:33.133
You remember now, don't you?

10:33.166 --> 10:35.302
I'm gonna end you in this place.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.137
(shouting, grunting)

10:37.170 --> 10:38.706
Come on!

10:38.739 --> 10:41.474

11:08.201 --> 11:10.904
-(car door opens, closes)
-ALEX: Shit, man.

11:10.938 --> 11:13.506
I didn't see you.
Is your friend okay?

11:13.540 --> 11:15.743
He got away.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.781
Because of you.

11:22.215 --> 11:24.684
Wait a second.

11:24.718 --> 11:26.253
I know you.

11:26.286 --> 11:28.488
You're Richard Ramirez.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.656
Your picture's
all over the news.

11:29.689 --> 11:30.657
Cops looking for you.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.325
Holy shit!

11:32.359 --> 11:33.827
The Night Stalker?

11:33.861 --> 11:36.663
You killed,
like-like-like, 17 people.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.665
That was gonna be number 18
until you fucked it up.

11:38.698 --> 11:41.401
No, no, no. No, no, no.
No, hold up, hold up.

11:41.434 --> 11:44.504
I-I'm, like, a huge fan.

11:44.537 --> 11:47.274
No, seriously, you're-you're
a major inspiration.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.676
I'm kind of trying to get
into the blood game.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.912
Aiming for a big body count.

11:51.945 --> 11:54.214
Bigger than yours even.

11:54.247 --> 11:56.149
Check this out.

12:01.321 --> 12:03.723
Not too bad, right?

12:03.757 --> 12:05.025
She's number six.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.861
After this festival
will be eight.

12:07.895 --> 12:12.299
The two bitches who took my
thumbs were on their way here.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.204
That's metal.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.571
Dude,

12:18.605 --> 12:21.741
let me help you hunt down
this other guy.

12:21.775 --> 12:23.710
It's, like, the least I can do.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.278
This isn't some chick.

12:25.312 --> 12:26.947
I'm hunting big game.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.548
Yeah.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.717
You know Mr. Jingles?

12:30.750 --> 12:34.287
(exhales)
He's a legend.

12:34.321 --> 12:36.023
That's who that was?

12:39.492 --> 12:40.828
I don't know.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.632
There's a lot of terrain
out here.

12:45.665 --> 12:47.801
How we gonna find him?

12:51.171 --> 12:52.772
The Master...

12:52.806 --> 12:54.842
will show us the way.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.643
(groans)

12:58.278 --> 13:00.848
-(panting)
-(whispering voices)

13:00.881 --> 13:03.116
(groans, exhales)

13:05.118 --> 13:07.120
(knocking)

13:15.996 --> 13:18.165
STACEY:
I know you're in there.

13:18.198 --> 13:19.833
(whispers):
Don't open it.

13:24.371 --> 13:25.405
Hi, Donna.

13:26.639 --> 13:27.607
I know who you are.

13:27.640 --> 13:28.641
Both of you.

13:29.877 --> 13:31.178
How?

13:31.211 --> 13:32.779
Come to my room,
and I'll show you.

13:46.759 --> 13:48.128
STACEY:
I've been studying
the '84 massacre

13:48.161 --> 13:50.663
at Camp Redwood for three years.

13:50.697 --> 13:52.732
You might say I'm the world's
foremost expert on it.

13:52.765 --> 13:54.834
Well, that is, except,
of course, for you, Donna.

13:54.868 --> 13:56.069
Ah.

13:56.103 --> 13:57.337
Here it is.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.373
-How you know my name?
-Well, I first

14:00.407 --> 14:01.909
heard about you
when I was studying

14:01.942 --> 14:04.077
the Jingles escape
from Red Meadows Asylum.

14:04.111 --> 14:05.812
He never got visitors,
but you visited him

14:05.845 --> 14:07.147
a week before he escaped.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.815
I did a deep dive

14:08.848 --> 14:11.484
into you-- read your papers
on serial killers,

14:11.518 --> 14:13.553
found out about your dad.

14:13.586 --> 14:14.554
Yikes.
(chuckles softly)

14:14.587 --> 14:16.223
I know you pretty well.

14:16.256 --> 14:18.591
But it wasn't until I saw you
together in the diner

14:18.625 --> 14:21.594
that I realized it was you
at the execution.

14:21.628 --> 14:23.263
(inserts cassette in VCR)

14:27.434 --> 14:29.869
I had to pay the warden
1,500 bucks for this.

14:31.738 --> 14:34.007
So, what did you do?

14:34.041 --> 14:36.076
Give her something to slow
her heart rate down enough

14:36.109 --> 14:37.911
to convince everyone
she was dead?

14:39.612 --> 14:42.015
The only thing
that I can't figure out is why.

14:42.049 --> 14:44.217
A lot of effort
to go through all this.

14:44.251 --> 14:45.752
Pretty risky.

14:45.785 --> 14:47.620
What's the connection
between you two?

14:49.589 --> 14:51.024
Revenge.

14:51.058 --> 14:52.859
Brooke.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.028
We're the best story
she's ever had.

14:55.062 --> 14:56.696
There's no way
she's gonna let us go

14:56.729 --> 14:58.798
unless we give her
an even better story.

14:58.831 --> 15:00.867
Okay. I'm hooked.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.435
Let's negotiate.

15:02.469 --> 15:04.137
We tell you everything.

15:04.171 --> 15:06.873
You sneak us back into the camp
in the trunk of your car.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.908
And once we get there,
we'll walk you around,

15:08.942 --> 15:10.910
show you
where everything happened,

15:10.944 --> 15:12.879
tell you
how everything happened.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.148
And, in exchange...

15:15.182 --> 15:16.783
you let us go.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.821
You never reveal
Donna's identity,

15:21.854 --> 15:24.591
and you don't tell anyone
that I'm still alive.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.593
Not until the book comes out.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.328
Seems fair.

15:28.361 --> 15:30.797
But what's the new angle
you're hinting at?

15:30.830 --> 15:31.999
Give me a taste.

15:35.302 --> 15:37.837
Jingles didn't kill
all those people in the '70s,

15:37.870 --> 15:40.573
and I didn't kill anyone
five years ago.

15:40.607 --> 15:44.077
Well, except Montana,
in self-defense.

15:44.111 --> 15:46.113
It was Margaret Booth.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.515
DONNA:
That's why we're going up there.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.450
-Justice.
-If you can prove to me

15:50.483 --> 15:53.853
that Margaret fucking Booth is
actually one of the most vicious

15:53.886 --> 15:55.855
and prolific serial killers
of all time,

15:55.888 --> 15:58.558
I'll buy you first-class tickets
to Paris.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.462
(screams)

16:02.495 --> 16:04.497
(panting)

16:06.333 --> 16:07.334
-It gets better.
-(grunts)

16:07.367 --> 16:08.768
(panting)

16:08.801 --> 16:11.304
First time always feels
the worst.

16:11.338 --> 16:12.939
I f-f...

16:12.972 --> 16:14.774
felt everything.

16:14.807 --> 16:15.975
(shudders)

16:16.009 --> 16:18.645
Pain. Fear.

16:18.678 --> 16:21.014
The...
(panting)

16:21.048 --> 16:24.384
sudden disconnection
with everything.

16:24.417 --> 16:25.818
Like you're drifting in space?

16:25.852 --> 16:27.520
-Yes!
-Alone.

16:27.554 --> 16:28.855
Forever.

16:28.888 --> 16:31.358
How many times have you died?

16:31.391 --> 16:33.026
I've lost count.

16:33.060 --> 16:34.827
Maybe I forgot.

16:36.996 --> 16:40.067
Pieces of you goes missing.

16:41.101 --> 16:42.635
No.

16:42.669 --> 16:45.038
I can take the pain,

16:45.072 --> 16:48.875
but I cannot forget
why I am here.

16:48.908 --> 16:52.712
I can't... let my son down.

16:52.745 --> 16:54.881
(breathing heavily)

16:54.914 --> 16:57.050
Ramirez has to die.

16:57.084 --> 16:58.085
(grunts)

17:00.253 --> 17:02.222
Can ghosts get high?

17:02.255 --> 17:05.258
No. But it feels nice
to pretend.

17:05.292 --> 17:07.427
But you can have an orgasm?

17:07.460 --> 17:09.662
Sure. I don't make the rules.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.731
-We can feel fleeting pleasure.
-Hmm.

17:11.764 --> 17:14.067
We can feel pain,
we can feel scared,

17:14.101 --> 17:16.736
happy, in love, but...

17:16.769 --> 17:19.939
the only feeling that really
lasts is a constant longing.

17:19.972 --> 17:21.974
For what?

17:22.975 --> 17:24.377
To be alive.

17:24.411 --> 17:25.945
To be dead.

17:25.978 --> 17:28.215
To be anything but stuck here.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.017
That's why I'm gonna
kill everyone

17:31.050 --> 17:32.585
that steps foot in this place.

17:32.619 --> 17:34.421
Maybe the publicity
will bring someone

17:34.454 --> 17:36.356
that'll help us get out of here.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.525
And if that doesn't work,
then...

17:38.558 --> 17:40.693
there'll just be more people
for fun and sex

17:40.727 --> 17:42.695
-and groovy conversation.
-Huh.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.097
But...

17:44.131 --> 17:46.533
really, I just want
to be distracted.

17:46.566 --> 17:49.236
Probably easier
just to get cable TV installed.

17:49.269 --> 17:51.037
(Montana chuckles)

17:51.070 --> 17:54.141
* Feels like the world
upon my shoulders... *

17:54.174 --> 17:56.075
What if I stay here?

17:56.109 --> 17:59.045
I-I can check all those boxes.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.881
Fun and sex,
groovy conversation.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.616
-Definitely a lot
of distracting.
-(chuckles)

18:03.650 --> 18:06.052
At least for 50 years or so.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.288
Dude, if you think
you're gonna be able to get

18:08.321 --> 18:11.057
that elephant's trunk hard
in your 70s, you're nuts.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.725
And not the kind I like.

18:12.759 --> 18:15.462
Besides, what about your wife?

18:15.495 --> 18:17.230
(exhales)
I hate her.

18:17.264 --> 18:19.799
I just want to be with you.

18:19.832 --> 18:21.968
I-I love this place.
I love you.

18:22.001 --> 18:24.604
I... It all just feels
like home to me.

18:24.637 --> 18:26.339
You'd do that for me?

18:26.373 --> 18:29.075
There's nothing back there
for me.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.943
The '80s are over.

18:30.977 --> 18:33.346
People don't even do coke
anymore.

18:33.380 --> 18:34.981
Eh, fashion is boring.

18:35.014 --> 18:36.649
-Lots of flannel.
-(groans)

18:36.683 --> 18:39.586
Oh, and good luck finding
an aerobics class.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.521
I love you, Montana.

18:41.554 --> 18:43.055
You're '80s forever.

18:44.324 --> 18:47.026
* I want to feel what love is *

18:50.363 --> 18:55.168
* I know you can show me *

18:57.003 --> 18:59.206
* Oh... *

18:59.239 --> 19:01.241
(footsteps crunching)

19:02.309 --> 19:03.843
Can you be any louder?

19:03.876 --> 19:05.478
Dude, I hit him with a car.

19:05.512 --> 19:07.314
He can't be that much
of a threat.

19:07.347 --> 19:10.183
Jingles in his prime
is dangerous.

19:10.217 --> 19:12.151
An injured Jingles is
twice as deadly.

19:12.185 --> 19:13.620
What is he-- a jungle cat?

19:13.653 --> 19:15.688
-He's my worst enemy.
-(scoffs)

19:15.722 --> 19:19.392
I'm just trying to make sure
that he dies here in this camp.

19:19.426 --> 19:22.195
Bro, what'd he do to you?

19:22.229 --> 19:23.363
(sniffs)

19:25.031 --> 19:27.033
You ever been on a roll,

19:27.066 --> 19:29.636
when every decision is right,
every move works out,

19:29.669 --> 19:32.339
and everyone is just
one step behind?

19:32.372 --> 19:33.673
Hell yeah.

19:33.706 --> 19:37.143
When you know
nothing can stop you.

19:37.176 --> 19:40.213
That's how it was...
right before I was caught.

19:40.247 --> 19:41.814
Mm.

19:41.848 --> 19:44.050
I could have kept on killing
for years.

19:45.718 --> 19:48.921
But Jingles betrayed me,

19:48.955 --> 19:53.059
and for that,
I will have my vengeance.

19:53.092 --> 19:55.895
-(sniffing)
-I know exactly how you feel.

19:55.928 --> 19:57.330
Who the fuck are you?

19:57.364 --> 19:59.065
Another one of Jingles' victims.

19:59.098 --> 20:02.201
Come on.
I know where he is.

20:04.371 --> 20:06.673
(scoffs)
Yeah, sure.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.341
XAVIER:
Once his body is
fully uncovered,

20:08.375 --> 20:09.742
he'll come right back.

20:09.776 --> 20:12.111
Won't be able to help himself.

20:12.144 --> 20:14.447
Like a criminal
to a crime scene.

20:14.481 --> 20:16.616
I don't know why we do it.
Maybe it's to try to remember

20:16.649 --> 20:18.818
those last moments
when we were alive.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.821
It never works, though.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.191
I don't get it.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.993
Who is it?

20:28.261 --> 20:30.597
Son of a bitch.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.765
This is the fucker
who roasted me alive.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.768
(guttural gasping)

20:42.942 --> 20:44.277
You found me.

20:44.311 --> 20:45.812
What the fuck?

20:45.845 --> 20:48.415
How is his dead body here
and he's standing here?

20:49.449 --> 20:51.284
You stay, you die.

20:51.318 --> 20:52.352
All right.

20:55.422 --> 20:57.156
Who offed you?

20:57.189 --> 20:58.591
I killed myself.

20:58.625 --> 21:00.593
Fucker, I wanted to do that!

21:00.627 --> 21:02.261
Why?

21:02.295 --> 21:03.963
You afraid to face me?

21:03.996 --> 21:05.332
I was afraid I wouldn't.

21:05.365 --> 21:06.799
(Ramirez laughs)

21:06.833 --> 21:09.268
Oh, I get it, Key-man.

21:09.302 --> 21:12.805
You killed yourself to beat me.

21:12.839 --> 21:14.974
That took a lot of balls.

21:15.007 --> 21:17.243
I'd do anything
to keep my son safe.

21:17.276 --> 21:21.481
A lot of balls,
but not a lot of brains.

21:22.515 --> 21:24.451
See, you forgot one thing.

21:24.484 --> 21:26.185
You can't ever leave.

21:27.620 --> 21:31.624
So I'm getting the fuck out.

21:31.658 --> 21:33.259
I'm going to Alaska,

21:33.292 --> 21:35.828
and I'm going to cut your boy
into little pieces.

21:35.862 --> 21:38.798
It's what I should have done
when I murdered your wife.

21:38.831 --> 21:41.968
Killing your son will be
my final revenge.

21:42.001 --> 21:43.436
(Ramirez groaning)

21:43.470 --> 21:45.505
-I won't let you leave.
-(groans)

21:45.538 --> 21:47.507
You're gonna die here,
and then I'm gonna

21:47.540 --> 21:49.175
spend every day hunting you

21:49.208 --> 21:50.943
to make you pay
for what you've done.

21:50.977 --> 21:53.045
-(gunshot)
-(body thuds)

21:54.647 --> 21:56.282
Margaret?

21:56.315 --> 21:58.651
-What the fuck?!
-Who the hell is this?

21:58.685 --> 22:01.220
-Easy, baby.
-He's with me.

22:01.253 --> 22:04.056
His résumé's a little thin,
but he's willing to learn.

22:04.090 --> 22:05.892
You two know each other?

22:05.925 --> 22:09.462
We've had a mutual admiration
and a deep sexual attraction.

22:09.496 --> 22:11.197
Cool.

22:11.230 --> 22:13.666
RAMIREZ:
I would have
slaughtered Jingles.

22:15.402 --> 22:17.904
But I can forgive you
for cock-blocking me.

22:17.937 --> 22:21.173
He'll be back soon, but I need
something from you both.

22:21.207 --> 22:23.643
I have a plan,
and I think you'll approve.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.878
I need all the killers
I can get.

22:28.381 --> 22:30.650
Let me get this straight.

22:30.683 --> 22:33.386
Margaret Booth wasn't the only
serial killer at the camp.

22:33.420 --> 22:35.688
Richard Ramirez,
aka the Night Stalker,

22:35.722 --> 22:38.190
was also here with Mr. Jingles.

22:38.224 --> 22:39.826
They fought to the death

22:39.859 --> 22:42.895
while you were caught in a net
dangling from this tree.

22:42.929 --> 22:44.997
That's right.

22:45.031 --> 22:47.366
It's a wonder they didn't
let you testify at your trial.

22:47.400 --> 22:50.202
-You don't believe me?
-Oh, honey, I do.

22:50.236 --> 22:53.205
In my experience, truth is often
stranger than fiction.

22:53.239 --> 22:55.374
I made a good living
because of that.

22:55.408 --> 22:57.276
But in a way, it doesn't matter,

22:57.309 --> 23:00.079
because this is your story
told from your point of view,

23:00.112 --> 23:03.450
so whatever you say is right
is right.

23:03.483 --> 23:04.884
She's giving it to you straight.

23:04.917 --> 23:06.553
Truth is not malleable.

23:06.586 --> 23:08.220
I work for the Enquirer.
My motto is:

23:08.254 --> 23:10.523
Never let the facts
get in the way of the truth,

23:10.557 --> 23:13.960
and never let the truth get in
the way of a story that sells.

23:16.262 --> 23:19.231
That bitch don't give a shit
about nothing but a paycheck.

23:19.265 --> 23:21.033
She's going to expose us.

23:21.067 --> 23:22.902
She will ruin our lives.

23:22.935 --> 23:24.971
It'll be fine.
We just have to show her

23:25.004 --> 23:26.639
the shack you tied me up in.

23:26.673 --> 23:28.575
How is that gonna change
anything?

23:28.608 --> 23:30.142
That's where I'll kill her.

23:30.176 --> 23:31.878
She is not leaving
this camp alive.

23:31.911 --> 23:33.613
Brooke, you're not a murderer.

23:33.646 --> 23:36.315
The only person you killed
was in self-defense.

23:36.348 --> 23:38.217
That Brooke died
in prison five years ago.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.652
This is who I am now.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.288
Come on, Stacey.

23:42.321 --> 23:43.690
I want to show you
something else.

24:01.508 --> 24:03.943
Looks like big Mr. Scary Jingles
lost his scary.

24:03.976 --> 24:06.613
You got to let me go. You don't
know what you're doing.

24:06.646 --> 24:08.247
RAY:
We know exactly
what we're doing.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.082
-You fucking murdered me.
-Ditto.

24:10.116 --> 24:11.851
You just turned me
into a kabob.

24:11.884 --> 24:13.786
I might be dead,
but I'm still traumatized.

24:13.820 --> 24:16.022
You had a chance to square up
by asking your creepy-ass mom

24:16.055 --> 24:18.290
how we get out of here,
but you couldn't even do that.

24:18.324 --> 24:20.326
-I'm sorry!
-Sorry?

24:20.359 --> 24:21.994
You stuffed me in an oven!

24:22.028 --> 24:25.865
I was gonna be an actor,
not just on stage, on TV.

24:25.898 --> 24:28.434
I had two callbacks
for The A-Team.

24:28.467 --> 24:31.838
I was about to break,
make a life, build a legacy.

24:31.871 --> 24:33.706
Now, thanks to you,
I'm just stuck up here

24:33.740 --> 24:35.374
being slowly forgotten.

24:35.407 --> 24:38.645
You have to pay for everything
you've taken from me.

24:38.678 --> 24:41.180
From all of us!

24:41.213 --> 24:42.782
-Who wants next?
-MR. JINGLES: Oh, you're right.

24:42.815 --> 24:45.652
You want to kill me, torture me,
I've got it coming.

24:45.685 --> 24:47.153
Do whatever you want to me,

24:47.186 --> 24:49.388
but first, please just let me
kill Ramirez.

24:49.421 --> 24:50.823
CHET (laughing):
No way.

24:50.857 --> 24:52.158
That dude's a dick.

24:52.191 --> 24:53.693
You kill him here,
he stays here.

24:53.726 --> 24:55.161
And no one wants
Satan's ball washer

24:55.194 --> 24:56.462
around for all of time.

24:56.495 --> 24:57.997
If I don't trap his soul,

24:58.030 --> 25:00.499
if he leaves this camp,
innocent people will die.

25:00.533 --> 25:02.134
We were innocent once, too.

25:02.168 --> 25:03.502
Yeah, all of us were.

25:03.536 --> 25:04.904
Well, except for Ray.

25:04.937 --> 25:06.839
My son's gonna die.

25:06.873 --> 25:08.474
Boo-hoo.

25:08.507 --> 25:10.810
He isn't like me.

25:10.843 --> 25:12.679
He's a good little boy.

25:12.712 --> 25:16.749
Why take everything that was
taken from you from him?

25:16.783 --> 25:19.218
How does that make you
any better than me?

25:19.251 --> 25:20.587
Bobby.

25:20.620 --> 25:22.521
His name is Bobby.

25:22.555 --> 25:25.892
And if Ramirez makes it
out of this camp,

25:25.925 --> 25:28.527
he's gonna die in 24 hours.

25:28.561 --> 25:30.396
Ramirez doesn't kill kids.

25:30.429 --> 25:32.064
Maybe not when you knew him.

25:32.098 --> 25:34.433
Look, he told me about you.

25:34.466 --> 25:36.402
How you brought him up here
that night.

25:36.435 --> 25:38.771
Wait. What's he talking about?

25:38.805 --> 25:41.608
How you seduced him,
used him to kill for you.

25:41.641 --> 25:43.876
You helped make him.

25:43.910 --> 25:45.444
I didn't make him.

25:45.477 --> 25:47.446
You did it
with the Night Stalker?

25:47.479 --> 25:48.881
He wasn't the Night Stalker
back then.

25:48.915 --> 25:50.382
It wasn't like
it was some big thing.

25:50.416 --> 25:53.920
Maybe not to you,
but to him, it was.

25:53.953 --> 25:57.089
You were like his inspiration,
the match that lit the fire.

25:57.123 --> 26:01.861
But you have no idea how the
fire spread after he left here.

26:01.894 --> 26:04.196
How it spread out of control.

26:04.230 --> 26:06.365
Kids, old people--
it didn't matter.

26:06.398 --> 26:08.701
As long as they were flesh,
blood and innocent,

26:08.735 --> 26:10.737
they were ripe for his horrors.

26:10.770 --> 26:12.772
If I could

26:12.805 --> 26:16.475
give you all back
what I took from you, I would.

26:16.508 --> 26:19.746
But the only life
I have a chance to save now

26:19.779 --> 26:21.080
is my son's.

26:21.113 --> 26:23.049
Please...

26:23.082 --> 26:25.284
give me this last chance.

26:29.622 --> 26:31.090
This is where I woke up,

26:31.123 --> 26:33.559
totally disoriented
and afraid.

26:33.592 --> 26:36.729
I thought the night was over.

26:36.763 --> 26:39.598
Little did I know,
it had just begun.

26:39.632 --> 26:41.934
Oh, hey, that's good.
Can I quote you?

26:41.968 --> 26:43.970
-Sure.
-So Margaret rendered you
unconscious

26:44.003 --> 26:45.638
using some type of drug?

26:45.672 --> 26:47.406
Horse tranquilizers.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.676
-(chuckling): Great detail.
-Here's another one.

26:49.709 --> 26:50.977
It wasn't Margaret.

26:52.044 --> 26:53.312
It was Donna.

26:53.345 --> 26:54.947
She was working with Jingles.

26:57.149 --> 26:58.818
You're saying Donna
played an active role

26:58.851 --> 27:00.519
that night at the camp?

27:00.552 --> 27:02.521
Shh. Save it for the book.

27:02.554 --> 27:05.357
-She'd be pissed
if she knew that I told you.
-Of course.

27:07.794 --> 27:09.328
Close your eyes.

27:09.361 --> 27:12.364
Y-You want to know
what I went through that night?

27:12.398 --> 27:14.633
Put yourself in my shoes?

27:14.667 --> 27:16.335
Then let's go there.

27:16.368 --> 27:18.137
That's what real writing's
all about, right?

27:18.170 --> 27:20.539
It's what makes a best seller.

27:23.409 --> 27:26.946
That night, everything changed.

27:26.979 --> 27:29.548
I realized I was capable of...

27:29.581 --> 27:30.817
(grunting, groaning)

27:30.850 --> 27:33.452
I can't let you do this!

27:33.485 --> 27:36.488
I agreed to help you kill
one person and one person only.

27:36.522 --> 27:37.857
Bitch, run.

27:37.890 --> 27:40.292
No! No!

27:40.326 --> 27:42.228
(both grunting)

27:42.261 --> 27:44.697
This isn't who you are.

27:44.731 --> 27:46.465
There's evil inside you, yes.

27:46.498 --> 27:49.001
It's in us all,
dormant and waiting.

27:49.035 --> 27:50.569
I learned that from my father.

27:50.602 --> 27:52.571
It grows in us like a cancer,

27:52.604 --> 27:54.974
but only if you feed it
what it wants.

27:55.007 --> 27:56.709
Our hate and anger.

27:56.743 --> 27:58.711
That's how Margaret became
who she is.

27:58.745 --> 28:00.512
Same thing with Mr. Jingles.

28:00.546 --> 28:03.582
-All I have is anger.
-You're wrong.

28:03.615 --> 28:05.217
You have me.

28:05.251 --> 28:08.254
And together, we have a purpose.

28:08.287 --> 28:10.589
One righteous
motherfucking act of revenge.

28:10.622 --> 28:12.158
And if we can do that

28:12.191 --> 28:14.727
without hurting another soul
in the process,

28:14.761 --> 28:17.897
it'll wash away
every shitty thing we ever did.

28:17.930 --> 28:19.899
And we can both be final girls?

28:19.932 --> 28:21.333
Yeah.

28:21.367 --> 28:23.035
Just not yet.

28:23.069 --> 28:26.906
* Just a man
and his will to survive *

28:26.939 --> 28:28.908
* It's the eye of the tiger *

28:28.941 --> 28:31.043
* It's the thrill of the fight *

28:31.077 --> 28:35.214
* Rising up to the challenge
of our rival *

28:35.247 --> 28:37.449
* And the last known survivor *

28:37.483 --> 28:40.086
* Stalks his prey
in the night... *

28:40.119 --> 28:41.954
Oh, my God.
You're...

28:41.988 --> 28:43.689
the Night Stalker.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.958
* The eye of the tiger... *

28:45.992 --> 28:47.927
(Ramirez chuckles)

28:47.960 --> 28:49.061
You're Margaret Booth.

28:49.095 --> 28:50.562
You two are together.

28:51.630 --> 28:53.099
So what she said is true.

28:53.132 --> 28:54.700
Well, I don't know
what she told you,

28:54.733 --> 28:56.135
but anything is too much.

28:56.168 --> 28:58.137
* With the skill to survive *

28:58.170 --> 29:01.908
* It's the eye of the tiger... *

29:01.941 --> 29:04.243
You should be careful
about the friends you make.

29:04.276 --> 29:06.278
They're not my friends.
They're my subjects.

29:06.312 --> 29:08.247
I'm a writer. Use me.

29:08.280 --> 29:11.217
I can make serial killers
look sexy and fun.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.786
Or I can just shut the fuck up
and not write about it at all.

29:13.820 --> 29:16.255
-I'll do anything you want.
-Writers make me sick. (grunts)

29:16.288 --> 29:18.791
* The eye of the tiger. *

29:21.527 --> 29:23.095
So, that's the plan?

29:23.129 --> 29:24.763
We kill everyone we meet?

29:24.797 --> 29:27.433
I love it.
I can really get my numbers up.

29:27.466 --> 29:30.602
No, that's not a plan,
because it has no purpose.

29:30.636 --> 29:33.339
I want to do something
that will change the world.

29:33.372 --> 29:35.374
I'm so in.

29:36.642 --> 29:38.010
Lay it on me.

29:38.044 --> 29:39.745
Jim Morrison's grave,

29:39.778 --> 29:42.581
the archway at the Dakota
where John Lennon was shot,

29:42.614 --> 29:43.916
Graceland.

29:43.950 --> 29:45.451
People flock to these places

29:45.484 --> 29:48.754
just to feel a connection
to the artist they love.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.857
Well, we're going
to give that to them.

29:52.158 --> 29:53.792
We're going to kill
every musician

29:53.826 --> 29:55.694
that's coming for the festival.

29:55.727 --> 29:56.795
Flock of Seagulls?

29:56.829 --> 29:57.964
The Go-Go's.

29:57.997 --> 29:59.331
Except Billy Idol.

29:59.365 --> 30:00.699
-Yeah.
-We-we can't touch him.

30:00.732 --> 30:02.201
No. Don't touch him.

30:02.234 --> 30:05.104
Fine. People are going
to pay to come here.

30:05.137 --> 30:06.705
We're going to make Camp Redwood

30:06.738 --> 30:09.308
the mecca
for '80s music memoriam,

30:09.341 --> 30:12.111
and I am going
to make a fortune.

30:16.748 --> 30:19.185
I've been looking everywhere
for you.

30:19.218 --> 30:20.987
I didn't really want
to be found. (sniffles)

30:21.020 --> 30:23.022
Is everything okay?

30:25.858 --> 30:27.659
Montana.

30:31.563 --> 30:33.365
(sighs)

30:33.399 --> 30:34.967
I was thinking--

30:35.001 --> 30:37.536
which generally gets me
into trouble--

30:37.569 --> 30:39.005
but, uh,

30:39.038 --> 30:41.140
I had this... real idea.

30:41.173 --> 30:43.009
A radical one.

30:43.042 --> 30:45.044
Because of what you said before,
you know,

30:45.077 --> 30:47.046
what if...

30:47.079 --> 30:50.749
what if I stay here
and don't grow old?

30:51.951 --> 30:53.352
I mean, physically,

30:53.385 --> 30:55.221
I peaked at 25,
so I'm in plateau.

30:55.254 --> 30:57.990
Mentally, I can't imagine
myself getting...

30:58.024 --> 30:59.725
much smarter. Uh...

30:59.758 --> 31:02.861
With each passing year,
it's just going downhill.

31:02.895 --> 31:04.763
Why not stop the decline?

31:04.796 --> 31:06.432
You want to die here?

31:06.465 --> 31:08.067
Yeah.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.902
I'm gonna kill myself.

31:09.936 --> 31:12.271
I want us to be together,

31:12.304 --> 31:15.507
exactly like this, for eternity.

31:15.541 --> 31:17.809
I am so in love with you,
Montana.

31:19.711 --> 31:21.948
That's stupid.
You don't even know me.

31:21.981 --> 31:25.051
I'm not someone you can love,
much less die for.

31:25.084 --> 31:26.352
I'm a monster.

31:26.385 --> 31:28.820
How can you say that?

31:31.390 --> 31:33.926
My ex-boyfriend
is Richard Ramirez.

31:34.961 --> 31:36.528
Wh-What?

31:36.562 --> 31:38.430
Wow. I can't believe you.

31:38.464 --> 31:40.099
I see how you look at me now,

31:40.132 --> 31:41.467
like I'm disgusting.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.269
Men do heinous shit
all the time--

31:43.302 --> 31:45.871
carve up tits,
fuck dead corpses.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.907
And, you know what,
they're treated like rock stars.

31:48.941 --> 31:51.777
Fan mail, movies
and books up the wazoo.

31:51.810 --> 31:54.213
And, somehow,
it's always Mommy's fault

31:54.246 --> 31:55.747
for not loving them

31:55.781 --> 31:58.217
or the wife
who couldn't satisfy him

31:58.250 --> 32:00.252
or the pretty girl
who rejected him.

32:01.820 --> 32:03.455
Why are we always the scapegoat

32:03.489 --> 32:05.791
for sick men
to blame their bullshit on?

32:05.824 --> 32:07.426
I didn't make Ricky evil.

32:07.459 --> 32:10.629
He was already messed up
when I met him.

32:10.662 --> 32:14.333
I didn't know
he was gonna go apeshit.

32:14.366 --> 32:16.102
But fuck it.

32:16.135 --> 32:17.836
Fuck you all.

32:17.869 --> 32:20.006
You want to make me out
to be the villain?

32:20.039 --> 32:21.107
Fine.

32:21.140 --> 32:22.608
Now I deserve it.

32:22.641 --> 32:24.343
Since I died,

32:24.376 --> 32:26.612
I've killed
just as many people as him.

32:28.147 --> 32:30.282
And I fucking like it.
(chuckles softly)

32:30.316 --> 32:32.618
It's the only thing
in this inescapable hell

32:32.651 --> 32:34.620
that makes me feel alive.

32:34.653 --> 32:36.322
So you're right.

32:36.355 --> 32:37.323
I'm irredeemable.

32:37.356 --> 32:38.957
Montana,

32:38.991 --> 32:41.093
nothing you've done in your past

32:41.127 --> 32:43.129
means you need to keep doing it
in your future.

32:43.162 --> 32:44.863
We can all change.

32:44.896 --> 32:46.498
I don't deserve to be happy.

32:46.532 --> 32:48.167
No, I do not accept that.

32:49.335 --> 32:51.303
'Cause you are the only person

32:51.337 --> 32:53.172
that's made me realize
what happiness is.

32:53.205 --> 32:54.773
Fuck off, Trevor!

32:54.806 --> 32:56.808
How can I make this more clear?

32:56.842 --> 33:00.346
I don't want you. I need
someone fucked-up like me.

33:00.379 --> 33:03.482
I never want
to see you again. Go!

33:03.515 --> 33:05.284
Go, Trevor!

33:23.102 --> 33:24.736
(groaning)
Please don't do this.

33:24.770 --> 33:26.238
Y-You're not killing me.

33:26.272 --> 33:28.040
You're killing an innocent baby.

33:28.074 --> 33:31.177
Aw. Is it your baby?

33:32.178 --> 33:34.180
Then I'm fine with it.

33:34.213 --> 33:36.948
(groaning)

33:39.351 --> 33:40.719
You're never gonna know peace.

33:40.752 --> 33:41.920
Not while you're here.

33:41.953 --> 33:44.623
(groaning)

33:45.957 --> 33:48.894
You're gonna die over and over.

33:48.927 --> 33:50.329
Not yet.

33:50.362 --> 33:52.531
Let him bleed out slowly,

33:52.564 --> 33:54.533
think about what's to come.

33:54.566 --> 33:56.435
-(grunts)
-(groans)

33:56.468 --> 33:57.603
(whimpers)

34:08.914 --> 34:11.917
LARRY:
No one can help you now,
Mr. Jingles!

34:18.790 --> 34:20.259
(grunts)

34:20.292 --> 34:21.927
(groans)
I'm...

34:21.960 --> 34:23.028
(exhales)

34:23.061 --> 34:24.763
I'm sorry, Bobby.

34:24.796 --> 34:26.265
(whimpers)

34:26.298 --> 34:28.734
(footsteps in distance)

34:34.072 --> 34:36.475
(pained grunting)

34:48.086 --> 34:50.222
BOBBY:
What did the mayonnaise say
to the refrigerator?

34:50.256 --> 34:53.091
What did the mayonnaise say
to the refrigerator?

34:57.363 --> 34:58.764
I don't know.

34:58.797 --> 34:59.931
What?

34:59.965 --> 35:02.201
Close the door.
I'm dressing.

35:10.176 --> 35:12.478
LAVINIA:
I made sandwiches.

35:12.511 --> 35:14.946
No crusts.

35:17.983 --> 35:19.918
Uh, where am I?

35:19.951 --> 35:21.853
We're having a picnic.

35:21.887 --> 35:24.290
All of us, together.

35:24.323 --> 35:26.592
Isn't it nice?

35:26.625 --> 35:29.127
It is.

35:29.161 --> 35:31.363
I love picnics, but...

35:31.397 --> 35:32.364
I...

35:32.398 --> 35:34.065
I don't deserve this.

35:35.501 --> 35:38.170
I f-failed my son.

35:38.204 --> 35:40.939
Oh, Benji.

35:40.972 --> 35:43.175
I am so sorry.

35:43.209 --> 35:46.011
But you did the best you could.

35:46.044 --> 35:49.181
You made the ultimate sacrifice.

35:49.215 --> 35:53.719
There's so much violence
and evil in that camp.

35:53.752 --> 35:56.054
Nothing can rise above it.

35:57.088 --> 35:58.524
I...

36:01.727 --> 36:03.695
I lost my Bo...
(shudders)

36:03.729 --> 36:06.097
Bobby.
(crying)

36:14.773 --> 36:17.376
But we found ours.

36:18.410 --> 36:20.078
He's with us again.

36:20.111 --> 36:23.882
You... brought him back to me.

36:23.915 --> 36:26.852
And I am eternally grateful.

36:28.220 --> 36:29.988
What can I do now?

36:30.021 --> 36:33.024
Um, how can I ever rest?

36:33.058 --> 36:35.727
The past...

36:35.761 --> 36:39.130
it will haunt you forever
if you let it.

36:40.366 --> 36:42.067
We're a family here.

36:43.201 --> 36:45.003
This is where you can...

36:45.036 --> 36:47.773
find peace.

36:49.275 --> 36:51.176
BOBBY:
Stay with us, Benji,

36:51.209 --> 36:52.578
and nothing can hurt you
anymore.

36:52.611 --> 36:53.912
I promise.

36:53.945 --> 36:55.381
(chuckles softly)

36:55.414 --> 36:56.915
Come play with me.

36:58.584 --> 37:00.151
(quietly):
Go.

37:08.159 --> 37:10.596
(birds chirping)

38:12.123 --> 38:14.893
