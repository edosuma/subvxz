14:03.616 --> 14:07.122
Governor, Mitchell's arrived back
from hospital. Discharge papers.

14:07.128 --> 14:09.318
Nurse Shen said you need
to look at them immediately.

14:13.885 --> 14:15.210
Have you seen these?

14:15.290 --> 14:17.909
No, but the doctor briefed
me when we picked her up.

14:19.885 --> 14:21.798
- Is she in Medical?
- Yep.

14:21.988 --> 14:25.025
Oh, could you get IT to have a
look at my phone? The direct line?

14:25.031 --> 14:26.812
- I think it's playing up.
- Yes, Governor.

14:28.594 --> 14:30.185
How you feeling, Mitchell?

14:30.594 --> 14:32.391
Hundred percent, Governor.

14:32.792 --> 14:34.355
But, you see, Nurse Shen, over there,

14:34.361 --> 14:35.949
wants to keep me all to herself.

14:35.955 --> 14:37.863
Well, she has your
best interests at heart.

14:38.357 --> 14:40.766
- We all do.
- (SCOFFS) Yeah?

14:41.157 --> 14:43.362
So, then, open the front
door and let me out of here!

14:44.091 --> 14:45.837
You have a history of epilepsy.

14:46.091 --> 14:47.804
It's not on your prisoner file.

14:48.908 --> 14:50.702
Must have forgot to tell you.

14:51.202 --> 14:54.002
- It's no big deal.
- We need to know these things.

14:54.918 --> 14:57.715
We have to be prepared if you have
a seizure like you did yesterday.

14:57.721 --> 14:59.510
(SCOFFS) That wasn't a seizure.

15:00.209 --> 15:02.820
- I just tripped and banged my head.
- Right.

15:05.490 --> 15:08.815
I've seen the MRI scan and I
have read the specialist's report.

to spend my rec time.

29:10.696 --> 29:12.282
The demons gone?

29:12.688 --> 29:14.100
Thanks to you.

29:15.109 --> 29:16.532
That's what you do.

29:17.204 --> 29:19.998
Oh, so, what does that make me, then,

29:20.004 --> 29:23.893
- your shrink or your exorcist?
- I don't know what to call you.

29:24.208 --> 29:25.700
How about Marie?

29:27.015 --> 29:28.424
Marie.

29:30.490 --> 29:32.153
So, Will...

29:33.048 --> 29:34.971
have you done this before...

29:34.977 --> 29:36.564
fucked a prisoner?

29:36.944 --> 29:38.341
Never.

29:38.833 --> 29:40.269
Me neither.

29:48.039 --> 29:51.129
You know there's a rumour
that Kaz lags to you.

29:52.311 --> 29:53.710
Not true.

30:02.890 --> 30:04.090
Late night?

30:04.096 --> 30:07.460
Oh, it's just hard to sleep in
here with so many weird noises.

30:07.856 --> 30:09.771
I sleep like a Baba.

30:10.471 --> 30:11.838
How do you sleep?

30:11.844 --> 30:13.431
In the same unit as you...

30:13.437 --> 30:15.050
with one eye open.

30:19.368 --> 30:21.037
- BOOMER: What?
- LIZ: Hey...

30:21.043 --> 30:22.768
where's Ruby this mornin'?

30:23.352 --> 30:26.040
Obviously too shit-scared
to show her face.

30:26.046 --> 30:27.749
You know, before the big fight.

30:28.080 --> 30:29.728
I thought Ruby was your mate.

30:30.591 --> 30:31.791
(SHE SCOFFS)

30:31.797 --> 30:34.387
It's not personal, Kaz.
It's business, all right?

30:34.502 --> 30:36.106
I'll go easy on her.

30:39.538 --> 30:41.072
Yeah, right!

30:41.078 --> 30:43.125
(THEY CHUCKLE)

30:43.421 --> 30:44.739
See you out there.

30:52.697 --> 30:55.679
Um, look, um, this arrangement of ours,

30:55.798 --> 30:58.205
I think it's best for you if
you put a hold on it for now.

30:58.211 --> 31:00.520
It's... it's too dangerous
for you and I can't help you.

31:00.879 --> 31:04.845
Oh, um... I forgot to tell
you. It's, um, finished.

31:05.955 --> 31:07.536
I don't need you any more.

Nah, I reckon she's gone.

31:20.887 --> 31:23.385

31:23.391 --> 31:25.387

31:25.393 --> 31:27.392
Well, what is this,
a-a fuckin' no-show?

31:27.398 --> 31:30.184

31:33.486 --> 31:35.385
Fuck it! I'll go and get her.

31:35.480 --> 31:38.161
Drag her by the short and bloody
curlies if I have to. Move!

31:38.167 --> 31:40.455
You move! Fuckin' troll!

31:40.644 --> 31:42.888
Oi! Rube?

31:44.456 --> 31:46.765
Come and get your scrawny
little ass out here...

31:46.771 --> 31:49.083
- Oh, far out!
- What do you want, Boomer?!

31:49.089 --> 31:50.465
Oh, yeah, uh...

31:50.561 --> 31:52.665
You gonna fight me today or not?

31:53.164 --> 31:54.577
Get out!

31:55.069 --> 31:57.561
- Is that a yes or a no?
- No!

31:57.752 --> 31:59.775
Right. Right.

32:04.975 --> 32:07.088
- Thanks, Liz. (GIGGLES)
- Thanks, Liz.

32:09.354 --> 32:12.285
What am I bloody doing?
I still want my cut.

32:12.291 --> 32:15.223
- Hey, no fight, no cut.
- But that's not my bloody fault!

32:15.229 --> 32:17.016
- Oh!
- OK, let me tell ya...

32:17.022 --> 32:18.246
Ruby ditched the fight

32:18.252 --> 32:20.943
'cause she was too busy
bumpin' uglies with Allie, OK?

32:20.949 --> 32:22.339
Burned my fuckin' eyes,

32:22.345 --> 32:24.236
and now she don't wanna do a rematch.

32:24.644 --> 32:26.062
- So, what...
- Fuck!

32:27.149 --> 32:29.149

33:17.687 --> 33:18.887

couple of fuckin' biscuits.

33:23.882 --> 33:26.464
Oh, for f... f...!

33:31.401 --> 33:32.892

33:35.316 --> 33:38.143

you love always leaves you,

33:38.149 --> 33:39.652
Bea, Franky, Maxine.

33:39.658 --> 33:41.615
- Sonia.
- Sonia didn't love you.

33:41.621 --> 33:44.613
- Liz loves you.
- No, she doesn't!

33:44.619 --> 33:46.611
She's still here, and all
you do is treat her like shit.

33:46.617 --> 33:48.813
'Cause Liz <i>is</i> shit!
She's a fuckin' lagger!

33:48.993 --> 33:51.223
Is that all she is to you, Booms?

33:51.311 --> 33:53.128
- After everything?
- Yeah.

33:53.134 --> 33:56.413
She is the closest thing
to a mum you've got.

33:58.296 --> 34:01.490
Nah, see, you don't...
you don't fuckin' know.

34:01.663 --> 34:03.765
She is fuckin' with me head,

34:03.771 --> 34:06.655

bloody mind games with me. So...

34:07.918 --> 34:09.914
She's got dementia.

34:09.920 --> 34:11.228
Yeah!

34:13.036 --> 34:16.467
Her brain is dying.

34:16.934 --> 34:18.134
What?

34:18.139 --> 34:20.563
Liz is gonna need us, Booms.

34:21.456 --> 34:22.789
All of us.

Dementia, like, you, um...

34:26.491 --> 34:28.802
- You mean like old people?
- Exactly.

34:30.719 --> 34:33.210
She's not playing mind games with you.

34:33.472 --> 34:34.672
She just...

34:37.051 --> 34:39.092
forgets what's happened.

34:45.867 --> 34:48.476
- What the fuck?!
- You need to come with me.

34:48.482 --> 34:51.511
- Marie wants to talk to you.
- I don't give a fuck! Argh!

34:56.177 --> 34:57.907
we need to have a little chat.

34:57.913 --> 34:59.383
This about Allie?

34:59.877 --> 35:01.196
No, hon.

- So you don't know. OK.

All right. Now... now, this...

35:27.734 --> 35:29.455
this is you, yes?

35:29.461 --> 35:31.955
Is that you? Is that fucking you?!

35:31.961 --> 35:35.588
Yeah? This is you here,
and this is Danny Winter.

35:35.594 --> 35:37.902
So, you were at the bar, so tell me...

35:37.908 --> 35:40.322
you tell me who all these people are.

35:40.328 --> 35:42.853
- I dunno... I dunno, I just...
- Who's that guy behind you, hm?

35:42.859 --> 35:46.684
Argh! I was in the bar with
Shelley and I don't know who he is.

35:46.690 --> 35:48.872
All right, did you see
who Danny left with?

35:48.878 --> 35:50.970
- I don't... I don't know who they are.
- Did you see who he was with?

35:50.976 --> 35:53.086
Because he was attacked
the block away from here.

35:53.092 --> 35:54.774
I was only there for an hour,

35:54.877 --> 35:56.864

35:56.870 --> 35:59.370
(COUGHING) Ow! Argh!

35:59.592 --> 36:03.540
An hour early, you said. Now
look at that fucking clock!

36:03.846 --> 36:06.854
An hour. Is that right? You
left early? Well, look at that.

36:06.860 --> 36:09.041
You fuckin' look at that
clock. Now what does that say?

36:09.047 --> 36:11.220
That is before midnight.
You are still there.

36:11.226 --> 36:13.419
- Now what are you hiding?
- I can't remember!

36:13.425 --> 36:15.323
- Don't fuckin' lie!
- I can't remember.

- Quick, shut the door!

- Trying to make her talk.
- Ugh! Oh! (COUGHS)

- She was at the same bar

36:27.557 --> 36:29.067
with my boy the night he was attacked.

36:29.073 --> 36:32.738

- I can't remember. I can't remember.

he was spewin' up.

45:01.150 --> 45:03.326
(PHONE RINGING)

45:03.391 --> 45:05.936
- Hey, Vera.
- Will, it's Jake!

45:05.996 --> 45:08.433
- What?
- Jake is the prowler!

45:08.439 --> 45:10.039
He's been... he's been doing all of it!

45:10.045 --> 45:11.526
OK, Vera, where are you?

45:11.532 --> 45:13.548
He's here now. I am outside my house.

45:13.554 --> 45:15.421
He's just thrown a bloody
brick through my window!

45:15.427 --> 45:17.558
Vera, listen. That... that's impossible.

45:17.564 --> 45:19.547
No, it is. I know it is him.

45:19.553 --> 45:21.871
- He is here now!
- It can't be him.

45:22.071 --> 45:24.442
Vera, I'm standing right
next to him. We're at work.

45:25.855 --> 45:28.920
OK, listen, go inside, lock
the doors. We're on our way.
