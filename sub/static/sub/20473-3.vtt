I already wrote to Mileva
to tell her I got the job.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.470
Mileva? What has she
got to do with this?

10:37.471 --> 10:40.122
Put in a good word for me,
Marcel, in your department.

10:40.123 --> 10:42.520
I am a flea on the
smelly ass of academia.

10:42.521 --> 10:44.630
No one cares what I have to say.

10:44.631 --> 10:46.867
But there is a position I know of.

10:46.868 --> 10:48.786
Decent wage, steady hours.

10:48.787 --> 10:50.384
What is it?

10:50.385 --> 10:52.301
It's in Bern at the patent office.

10:52.302 --> 10:54.220
Um, clerical position,
but very interesting work.

10:54.221 --> 10:56.425
You could employ some of
your engineering knowledge.

10:56.426 --> 10:57.864
I'm a scientist, Marcel!

10:57.865 --> 10:59.206
I'm better than a clerkship.

10:59.207 --> 11:01.444
- You need money.
- I need a thought,

11:01.445 --> 11:04.705
a paper that can show people
what I can do; I need time.

11:04.706 --> 11:06.367
No, you need a job.

11:06.368 --> 11:07.837
Why not ask your father

11:07.838 --> 11:10.491
could he set you up
in the factory in Milan?

11:10.492 --> 11:12.217
Because he humiliated me.

11:12.218 --> 11:14.134
I'm done with him, after
the letter to Weber.

11:14.135 --> 11:16.693
Did it ever occur to you
that perhaps your father

11:16.694 --> 11:19.250
reached out to Weber because
he cares about you?

11:19.251 --> 11:20.624
Be practical, Albert.

11:20.625 --> 11:22.765
If you will not get a real job,

11:22.766 --> 11:24.748
how on earth will you survive?

11:24.749 --> 11:26.352
Hmm?

11:32.069 --> 11:34.184
♪ ♪

11:34.979 --> 11:37.093
MAN: Whoa.

11:44.984 --> 11:46.261
Maja.

11:46.262 --> 11:48.211
Big brother.

11:48.212 --> 11:49.490

11:49.491 --> 11:50.801

11:57.003 --> 12:00.423

12:06.913 --> 12:08.575
How's Mother?

12:08.576 --> 12:10.396
Did you really have to send her

12:10.397 --> 12:12.155
a photo of your Serbian temptress?

12:12.156 --> 12:14.104
I thought she might like it.

12:14.105 --> 12:16.374
What she really liked was Marie.

12:16.375 --> 12:18.420
She was counting on
you two getting married,

12:18.421 --> 12:20.977
so don't mention Mileva.

12:20.978 --> 12:22.964

12:24.974 --> 12:27.723
PAULINE: Tell me everything
that's been happening.

12:27.724 --> 12:30.631
I'm sure the world is
beating down your door.

12:30.632 --> 12:33.348
I'm, uh, developing many new ideas.

12:33.349 --> 12:35.010
Won't be long before I'm
recognized for my work.

12:35.011 --> 12:36.129
(chuckles)

12:36.130 --> 12:38.464
But, um,

12:38.465 --> 12:40.158
right now, Mother,

12:40.159 --> 12:43.041
the-the truth is, I need money.

12:45.720 --> 12:47.317
Your father's business

12:47.318 --> 12:49.748
needed another infusion
of capital, darling.

12:49.749 --> 12:51.569
I can't go to my brother again.

12:51.570 --> 12:54.286
I'm afraid the well is dry.

12:54.287 --> 12:56.173
You'll have to manage on your own.

12:56.174 --> 12:57.804
If there's such
pressing money concerns,

12:57.805 --> 13:00.040
then why are you taking
such lavish holidays?

13:00.041 --> 13:01.575
Lower your voice, dear.

13:01.576 --> 13:04.772
We must keep up appearances.

13:04.773 --> 13:07.552
If only Marie were here
to teach you some manners.

13:07.553 --> 13:08.767
Marie and I are finished.

13:08.768 --> 13:10.173
And it seems to me, if you apologize

13:10.174 --> 13:11.485
for your boorish behavior,

13:11.486 --> 13:12.892
you may have a chance to win her back.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.585
Mother, you know very well

13:14.586 --> 13:16.472
that I have someone else now.

13:16.473 --> 13:18.550
What? That creature
in the photo you sent?

13:18.551 --> 13:21.682
- She isn't even Jewish.
- Neither is Marie.

13:21.683 --> 13:23.056
Well, at least she isn't Slavic.

13:23.057 --> 13:24.303
- What does that mean?
- Mother.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.477
- Be... She'll be the end of you,
- Albert.

13:26.478 --> 13:28.172
She's just a nasty little witch.

13:28.173 --> 13:29.258
She is no witch.

13:29.259 --> 13:31.687
She's my wife.

13:31.688 --> 13:33.228
(gasps)

13:37.059 --> 13:39.136
Oh.

13:39.137 --> 13:41.315
(crying)

13:43.165 --> 13:44.922
You married that girl?

13:44.923 --> 13:46.329
No, of course not.

13:46.330 --> 13:48.598
Then why did you say that you did?

13:48.599 --> 13:51.474
Because I can't stand the way
that Mother talks about Mileva

13:51.475 --> 13:53.744
and I don't want to give
her the satisfaction

13:53.745 --> 13:55.183
of thinking she can tell me what to do.

13:55.184 --> 13:57.842
So then you're not marrying Mileva.

14:01.994 --> 14:04.071
(sighs)

14:04.072 --> 14:06.377
I'm going to have to.

14:08.419 --> 14:11.805
How... How far along is she?

14:11.806 --> 14:15.066
- Six months.
- God, Albert.

14:15.067 --> 14:17.719
I don't know what I'm supposed to say.
Congratulations?

14:17.720 --> 14:19.574
Are you happy about this?

14:19.575 --> 14:23.121
I love her, Maja.

14:23.122 --> 14:26.830
She's-She's like nobody
I've ever met before.

14:26.831 --> 14:31.081
I felt this... this pull towards her.

14:31.082 --> 14:35.525
Since I saw her, I...
I should be thrilled, but...

14:35.526 --> 14:36.644
But?

14:36.645 --> 14:37.923
Well, now I feel this opposing force

14:37.924 --> 14:40.160
pulling me down.

14:40.161 --> 14:42.397
I'm just getting started with my life.

14:42.398 --> 14:45.308
I'm-I'm worried that if I marry her,

14:45.309 --> 14:49.813
I'll never take flight.

14:49.814 --> 14:52.728
What other choice do you have?

15:02.332 --> 15:03.502
You have a visitor.

15:03.503 --> 15:04.973
MILEVA: A visitor? But who could...?

15:04.974 --> 15:07.337
Sir.

15:07.338 --> 15:09.382
This is quite unexpected.

15:09.383 --> 15:10.980
My dear, it is wonderful to see you.

15:10.981 --> 15:14.783
I would stand,
but you may remember my hip.

15:14.784 --> 15:16.701
It's been acting up.

15:16.702 --> 15:17.693
Yes, of course.

15:17.694 --> 15:19.129
I have to say I was overjoyed

15:19.130 --> 15:21.175
when your father paid a visit

15:21.176 --> 15:24.627
to inform me that my finest
student was back in town.

15:24.628 --> 15:28.205
But I have to admit this is
not merely a social call.

15:28.206 --> 15:30.283
- No?
- I am here

15:30.284 --> 15:32.234
to offer you a teaching position

15:32.235 --> 15:33.896
for the spring term.

15:33.897 --> 15:36.227
It is time we had a woman

15:36.228 --> 15:38.530
on the permanent faculty.

15:38.531 --> 15:40.703
It is a new era.

15:40.704 --> 15:42.972
MILEVA: <i>How could you
ambush me like that?</i>

15:42.973 --> 15:45.208
What if he'd seen my belly?

15:45.209 --> 15:46.902
My secret would be out.

15:46.903 --> 15:48.181
Calm yourself, Mileva.

15:48.182 --> 15:49.810
I just wanted you to know

15:49.811 --> 15:51.248
that there is an alternative.

15:51.249 --> 15:54.030
Einstein used to write you every day.

15:54.031 --> 15:56.009
Now it's once a week at most.

15:56.010 --> 15:59.878
He's... he's very busy, Papa.

15:59.879 --> 16:01.762
Or maybe he has lost interest?

16:01.763 --> 16:03.520
You deduced all of that

16:03.521 --> 16:05.629
by the frequency of his letters?

16:05.630 --> 16:08.857
And so now you want me to
settle for being a schoolmarm?

16:08.858 --> 16:10.776
Perhaps you could teach physics?

16:10.777 --> 16:14.840
You could use the skills
you have learned.

16:20.139 --> 16:23.687
Are you giving up on me, Papa?

16:23.688 --> 16:26.115
I'm giving up on Einstein.

16:26.116 --> 16:28.033
He can't even get a job.

16:28.034 --> 16:30.271
You're wrong.

16:30.272 --> 16:31.803
He has a job.

16:31.804 --> 16:33.503
- Yeah.
- Teaching.

16:34.265 --> 16:37.237
But what is the ether?

16:37.238 --> 16:41.045
What kind of substance has
such remarkable properties?

16:42.863 --> 16:45.610
One has to twist all
of physics into knots

16:45.611 --> 16:47.367
just to make it work,
but it must exist, or else...

16:47.368 --> 16:49.801
Are you a Jew?

16:52.737 --> 16:54.909
I subscribe to no religion.

16:54.910 --> 16:56.642
You look like a Jew.

16:57.691 --> 16:59.864
Are you sliced? Down there?

16:59.865 --> 17:02.037
Does it feel odd to fornicate

17:02.038 --> 17:03.544
if you're sliced?

17:05.137 --> 17:08.779
Timo, your father isn't paying
me to tutor you

17:08.780 --> 17:12.262
about the ins and outs of...
about girls,

17:12.262 --> 17:14.405
but if you'll indulge me,

17:14.406 --> 17:16.545
I'll show you that mathematics

17:16.546 --> 17:18.846
is as elegant as the finest of women,

17:18.847 --> 17:21.116
and just like women,

17:21.117 --> 17:23.127
it might seem intimidating at first,

17:23.128 --> 17:26.037
but the truth is anyone can do it.

17:26.038 --> 17:27.635
LENARD: <i>Almost anyone
with rudimentary learning</i>

17:27.636 --> 17:29.392
could achieve the same results.

17:29.393 --> 17:31.278
All these prints were taken by me

17:31.279 --> 17:33.037
using my own tubes, not Rontgen's.

17:33.038 --> 17:37.511
It's one thing that you were
able to duplicate his outcome,

17:37.512 --> 17:39.556
but are you implying that Rontgen

17:39.557 --> 17:41.250
actually poached your tube model?

17:41.251 --> 17:44.285
Sir, not only did he
appropriate my design,

17:44.286 --> 17:46.971
he wrote to me asking for supplies.

17:46.972 --> 17:49.654
Supplies which are very
difficult to come by,

17:49.655 --> 17:51.796
and I did graciously comply.

17:51.797 --> 17:53.713
Only to be stabbed in the back,

17:53.714 --> 17:57.006
flank and front for my selfless deed.

17:57.007 --> 17:59.146
Yes, but why should any of
this concern the academy?

17:59.147 --> 18:00.552
LENARD: Professor Plom,

18:00.553 --> 18:02.502
the Nobel Committee is
considering candidates.

18:02.503 --> 18:04.643
If Rontgen receives recognition

18:04.644 --> 18:06.432
for something that isn't all his,

18:06.433 --> 18:09.149
then the entire fabric of this
institution is under attack.

18:09.150 --> 18:11.419
Unlike Rontgen,

18:11.420 --> 18:13.209
I'm seeking neither fame nor money.

18:13.210 --> 18:15.029
I am defending science itself.

18:15.030 --> 18:17.906
PLOM: What specifically
are you asking us to do?

18:17.907 --> 18:21.102
Compose a letter of support
to the Nobel Committee, hmm?

18:21.103 --> 18:22.732
Immediately.

18:22.733 --> 18:25.805
May we have the room, Philipp?

18:26.600 --> 18:28.554
Hmm, yeah.

18:31.808 --> 18:33.022
(door closes)

18:33.023 --> 18:35.386
He's bringing politics into science.

18:35.387 --> 18:36.761
I can't condone it.

18:36.762 --> 18:38.199
It's beneath us all.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.797
PLOM: Still, imagine how we would feel

18:39.798 --> 18:42.258
if an inferior talent
snatched recognition

18:42.259 --> 18:44.175
for one of our achievements.

21:14.158 --> 21:16.584
hypothetical atoms,
something called quanta.

21:16.585 --> 21:18.375
He needed help with algebra.

21:18.376 --> 21:22.082
But what good is algebra
if you have no understanding

21:22.083 --> 21:25.661
of how it applies to the
larger questions of science?

21:25.662 --> 21:28.161
You're fired, Einstein.

21:32.598 --> 21:35.090
(footsteps receding)

21:35.091 --> 21:37.007
(door opens)

21:37.008 --> 21:39.122
(door closes)

21:47.714 --> 21:50.371
(door opens)

21:52.188 --> 21:55.064
Where have you been?

21:55.065 --> 21:57.173
I'm so sorry, I was... (clears throat)

21:57.174 --> 21:58.994
I was working and then-then

21:58.995 --> 22:00.687
I got, uh, distracted,
and when I looked up...

22:00.688 --> 22:02.509
How could you leave me here?

22:02.510 --> 22:04.875
Do you have any idea what it's
like to be a pregnant woman

22:04.876 --> 22:06.440
traveling this country alone?

22:06.441 --> 22:07.687
Dollie.

22:07.688 --> 22:09.285
Of course you don't.

22:09.286 --> 22:10.979
I'm so stupid.

22:10.980 --> 22:12.992
No, you're not stupid.
You're brilliant. Come on.

22:12.993 --> 22:14.782
Look, I'm here now,

22:14.783 --> 22:16.858
and that's what's important, my love.

22:16.859 --> 22:20.854
Let me explain, you'll
understand everything.

22:20.855 --> 22:23.703
Radiation quanta.

22:25.809 --> 22:28.844
Planck's concept.

22:28.845 --> 22:30.728
Radiation quanta?

22:30.729 --> 22:32.039
This could be the breakthrough

22:32.040 --> 22:33.478
that I've been searching for.

22:33.479 --> 22:36.385
You didn't come to be with me,

22:36.386 --> 22:39.837
you came to use me
to help you with math.

22:39.838 --> 22:41.500
No, I was...

22:41.501 --> 22:43.225
Why did I expect any different?

22:43.226 --> 22:45.908
You-you write page after page
about work in your letters,

22:45.909 --> 22:47.955
but you almost never ask about me.

22:47.956 --> 22:50.064
- That isn't true.
- I search endlessly

22:50.065 --> 22:52.364
for some caring emotion

22:52.365 --> 22:54.890
like a pig digging for truffles,

22:54.891 --> 22:58.725
but I never find it.

22:58.726 --> 23:01.441
At least I know my father
was right about one thing.

23:01.442 --> 23:02.975
- And what's that?
- You're too damn selfish

23:02.976 --> 23:04.509
to be a good husband.

23:04.510 --> 23:07.864
I've defended you to everyone.

23:07.865 --> 23:10.421
And now I feel like a fool.

23:10.422 --> 23:11.987
None of them have ever met you,

23:11.988 --> 23:14.480
and yet they saw you
more clearly than I did.

23:14.481 --> 23:15.631
That's nonsense. Mileva, do you...

23:15.632 --> 23:16.813
You're having my child.

23:16.814 --> 23:18.635
And what a mistake that was.

23:18.636 --> 23:20.649
I'll live with the consequences

23:20.650 --> 23:23.012
forever.

23:23.013 --> 23:26.369
But at least the child and I
won't have you to let us down.

23:26.370 --> 23:27.456
What are you saying?

23:27.457 --> 23:30.050
I'm fairly certain I just said it.

23:31.451 --> 23:34.678
Don't act like you want to marry me.

23:34.679 --> 23:37.560
I know you don't.

23:57.944 --> 24:00.052
I missed the train
because I was distracted.

24:00.053 --> 24:02.034
I couldn't wait

24:02.035 --> 24:04.911
to share my ideas with you.

24:04.912 --> 24:08.171
Not because they promise
glory for me, but because...

24:08.172 --> 24:12.804
it was like peeking through
a keyhole to our future.

24:12.805 --> 24:15.936
The two of us. Huh?

24:15.937 --> 24:18.174
Mileva...

24:18.175 --> 24:21.407
you're the love of my life.

24:22.552 --> 24:24.788
And I will do the right thing for you

24:24.789 --> 24:26.387
and this child.

24:26.388 --> 24:28.278
I promise.

24:49.049 --> 24:51.829
GROSSMANN: <i>"Private lessons
in mathematics and physics,</i>

24:51.830 --> 24:54.384
<i>"given most thoroughly
by Albert Einstein.</i>

24:54.385 --> 24:56.366
Trial lesson free."

24:56.367 --> 24:57.900
Sounds promising.

24:57.901 --> 24:59.434
This is a new low, Albert.

24:59.435 --> 25:01.416
It's just temporary till
I find something better.

25:01.417 --> 25:03.077
GROSSMANN: If you're in such straits,

25:03.078 --> 25:05.092
the job in the patent
office is still open, and...

25:05.093 --> 25:05.890
I'm a scientist.

25:05.891 --> 25:07.902
I'm not a damn clerk.

25:07.903 --> 25:09.501
I just need time
to finish my new paper.

25:09.502 --> 25:10.747
Paper?

25:10.748 --> 25:12.798
What paper, Albert?

25:13.624 --> 25:15.924
Radiation packets.

25:15.925 --> 25:18.130
Planck calls them "quanta."

25:18.131 --> 25:20.335
You do realize that radiation quanta

25:20.336 --> 25:22.157
is an academic idea.
Planck himself does not believe

25:22.158 --> 25:24.042
- they describe reality.
- Planck himself is wrong.

25:24.043 --> 25:25.511
- (chuckles)
- You'll see.

25:25.512 --> 25:27.788
Someone else can rot
in a patent office.

25:34.077 --> 25:36.698
MAN: Albert Einstein?

25:36.699 --> 25:38.711
Maurice Solovine.

25:38.712 --> 25:40.629
How do you do?

25:40.630 --> 25:42.705
Sir, if I owe you money,

25:42.706 --> 25:45.774
then I'm afraid you'll
have to get in line.

25:45.775 --> 25:49.097
Are you not Albert Einstein?

25:49.098 --> 25:52.836
You are here for physics?

25:52.837 --> 25:54.210
Indeed.

25:54.211 --> 25:56.128
But recreationally.

25:56.129 --> 25:57.983
My friends accuse me of
being a bored dilettante,

25:57.984 --> 26:00.506
to which I plead guilty as charged.

26:00.507 --> 26:02.936
I've studied biology, philosophy,

26:02.937 --> 26:04.438
literature, art.

26:04.439 --> 26:07.185
Physics is the next logical subject

26:07.186 --> 26:09.615
in my illogical curriculum.

26:09.616 --> 26:11.660
I think I have room in my schedule.

26:11.661 --> 26:12.939
When would you like to start?

26:12.940 --> 26:14.824
I'm here now, Einstein.

26:14.825 --> 26:16.421
The first lesson is free, Herr...

26:16.422 --> 26:17.796
(inhales): What was your name again?

26:17.797 --> 26:20.737
Solovine.

26:20.738 --> 26:23.964
I tell you what. I'll pay anyway,

26:23.965 --> 26:25.435
provided you submit

26:25.436 --> 26:27.639
to a change of venue.

26:27.640 --> 26:31.378
SOLOVINE: <i>The previous occupant</i>

26:31.379 --> 26:33.296
has done a garish rococo treatment,

26:33.297 --> 26:35.757
so I will spend a good
chunk of my father's money

26:35.758 --> 26:37.994
scraping the fairy tale
out of the place.

26:37.995 --> 26:40.103
(sighs): Here's the wine.

26:40.104 --> 26:41.894
Now, where are the
women to pour it over?

26:41.895 --> 26:43.010
(laughs)

26:43.011 --> 26:44.802
Albert, this is Conrad Habicht.

26:44.803 --> 26:46.814
Lout, wretch,

26:46.815 --> 26:50.010
altogether bad influence,
and my brother-in-arms.

26:50.011 --> 26:52.440
Conrad, this is Albert Einstein,

26:52.441 --> 26:53.846
the most promising,

26:53.847 --> 26:56.722
illustrious young physicist
of his generation.

26:56.723 --> 26:58.607
Mmm. Well, I just hope he's better

26:58.608 --> 27:00.110
than that horrid fencing instructor

27:00.111 --> 27:01.260
you wasted our money on.

27:01.261 --> 27:02.601
Damn near impaled myself.

27:02.602 --> 27:04.231
- (laughs)
- (sighs)

27:04.232 --> 27:05.797
Well, come on, Einstein.

27:05.798 --> 27:09.569
We are your captive audience.

27:09.570 --> 27:11.870
Go on, Einstein.

27:11.871 --> 27:14.362
Dazzle us.

27:14.363 --> 27:16.855
(clears throat)

27:16.856 --> 27:18.491
D-Dazzle.

27:20.211 --> 27:22.129
Y-Yes, right.

27:22.130 --> 27:23.695
Uh, well... Um.

27:23.696 --> 27:25.038
(smacks lips) Uh...

27:25.039 --> 27:26.250
Liquids.

27:26.251 --> 27:28.169
Yes? They run in a tube.

27:28.170 --> 27:29.510
They tend to... They rise

27:29.511 --> 27:31.268
because of what is termed
the capillary effect...

27:31.269 --> 27:33.121
I've got a physics question.

27:33.122 --> 27:35.423
So, I was in my bathtub this morning,

27:35.424 --> 27:37.980
and I dunk my head at the same time

27:37.981 --> 27:40.057
as I knock my hairbrush in with my toe.

27:40.058 --> 27:42.742
And it hits the cast
iron, and it sounds

27:42.743 --> 27:43.893
quite loud underwater.

27:43.894 --> 27:46.066
Why is that?

27:46.067 --> 27:47.983
Well, um... Indulge me

27:47.984 --> 27:51.281
in something that I like to
call a thought experiment.

27:53.673 --> 27:55.654
Let's make waves.

27:55.655 --> 27:58.529
- A hammer hits a string,
- (both mouthing)

27:58.530 --> 27:59.872
causing a vibration

27:59.873 --> 28:03.393
which spreads out as a waveform.

28:06.200 --> 28:09.618
In this case, the medium is
a disturbance of the air,

28:09.619 --> 28:12.111
which, when it hits your eardrums,

28:12.112 --> 28:15.020
is interpreted as sound.

28:15.021 --> 28:16.489
Unlike matter,

28:16.490 --> 28:18.247
waves travel better
through denser materials.

28:18.248 --> 28:20.517
That's why your hairbrush sounded loud.

28:20.518 --> 28:21.731
Put your ears to a rail,

28:21.732 --> 28:23.201
and you can hear locomotives

28:23.202 --> 28:25.566
from miles away when all is silent

28:25.567 --> 28:27.291
an inch above the track.

28:27.292 --> 28:28.506
That's...

28:28.507 --> 28:29.944
- fantastic.
- Yes.

28:29.945 --> 28:32.086
But do you want to know what
I've really been thinking about?

28:32.087 --> 28:33.844
It's light,

28:33.845 --> 28:37.838
because light from
this candelabra, say,

28:37.839 --> 28:41.929
is a wave, just like sound.

28:41.930 --> 28:46.402
But if waves travel better
through denser materials,

28:46.403 --> 28:49.982
then why can I put up my hand

28:49.983 --> 28:52.417
and block out the brightest of lights?

28:53.179 --> 28:55.574
SOLOVINE: Yes.

28:55.575 --> 28:57.210
Why?

28:58.004 --> 29:01.104
Well, scientists think
that light travels

29:01.105 --> 29:03.149
through its own special,
invisible medium.

29:03.150 --> 29:04.394
They call it the ether.

29:04.395 --> 29:05.674
Yeah, but if it's invisible,

29:05.675 --> 29:07.878
- then how do we know it's there?
- We don't.

29:07.879 --> 29:09.861
People have been trying
to understand this for years.

29:09.862 --> 29:12.544
We can't...
We can't see it o-or feel it,

29:12.545 --> 29:14.270
but everywhere that light travels,

29:14.271 --> 29:15.612
the ether is there.

29:15.613 --> 29:16.540
That sounds

29:16.541 --> 29:17.818
pretty fantastical.

29:17.819 --> 29:18.744
- I agree.
- (both chuckle)

29:18.745 --> 29:21.142
But it's the best idea we've got.

29:21.143 --> 29:22.932
A wave needs a medium.

29:22.933 --> 29:24.753
But why?

29:24.754 --> 29:28.493
I don't know.

29:28.494 --> 29:30.985
But I intend to find out.

29:30.986 --> 29:33.862
Damn fine show, Einstein.

29:33.863 --> 29:35.364
(mouths)

29:35.365 --> 29:36.674
(baby cries)

29:36.675 --> 29:38.432
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

29:38.433 --> 29:40.732
(children yelling, laughing)

29:40.733 --> 29:42.778
I don't know how you do it, Helene.

29:42.779 --> 29:44.696
(chuckles)

29:44.697 --> 29:46.581
They turn out to be more of a delight

29:46.582 --> 29:48.946
than you can possibly imagine.

29:48.947 --> 29:51.215
What if I don't want children?

29:51.216 --> 29:53.037
Well, it's a bit late for that.

29:53.038 --> 29:56.712
(baby fusses)

29:56.713 --> 29:58.885
I don't know if I can count on Albert.

29:58.886 --> 30:00.066
Well, you can always

30:00.067 --> 30:01.441
count on me,

30:01.442 --> 30:03.168
Mileva.

30:03.169 --> 30:07.391
You've always been my
closest friend, Helene.

30:08.185 --> 30:11.738
And you love children.

30:12.531 --> 30:15.413
What if you took my baby?

30:17.773 --> 30:20.616
No, Mileva...

30:20.617 --> 30:23.690
Everything I've worked for...

30:25.060 --> 30:26.977
(chuckles)

30:26.978 --> 30:29.533
Forget I said that.

30:29.534 --> 30:31.482
It's horrid.

30:31.483 --> 30:34.237
I haven't been sleeping... (chuckles)

30:35.862 --> 30:38.322
(baby fusses)

30:38.323 --> 30:40.238
If it is what you need, Mileva...

30:40.239 --> 30:43.627
If it is what you <i>really</i> need...

30:43.628 --> 30:46.663
I will help you.

30:46.664 --> 30:49.097
(breathing raggedly)

30:54.078 --> 30:56.352
(cries)

30:59.574 --> 31:02.040
(sobs)

31:04.209 --> 31:06.861
(Mileva screams, gasps)

31:06.862 --> 31:09.231
(panting)

31:11.080 --> 31:12.747
("Maple Leaf Rag" playing on piano)

31:14.180 --> 31:16.512
(giggles)

31:16.513 --> 31:17.924
(guests laughing)

31:20.604 --> 31:23.127
SOLOVINE: Do you ever feel
like you're part

31:23.128 --> 31:25.817
of something larger?

31:26.609 --> 31:27.889
Yes. The universe is so vast.

31:27.890 --> 31:29.487
Lately, we've been
trying to measure it,

31:29.488 --> 31:31.469
- but so far...
- Albert, Jesus.

31:31.470 --> 31:32.555
I'm talking about

31:32.556 --> 31:33.706
the three of us.

31:33.707 --> 31:34.888
We should codify

31:34.889 --> 31:36.070
our little salon.

31:36.071 --> 31:37.190
We'll meet regularly...

31:37.191 --> 31:38.627
- Nightly.
- Nightly. Fine.

31:38.628 --> 31:41.599
With the express purpose of
ruminating on philosophy,

31:41.600 --> 31:43.357
science, music, art...

31:43.358 --> 31:45.113
And women.

31:45.114 --> 31:48.022
- (laughs)
- And women, too.

31:48.023 --> 31:50.547
But we need a name for
our little association.

31:50.548 --> 31:53.199
The honor is yours, Einstein.

31:53.200 --> 31:54.605
You made this possible.

SOLOVINE AND HABICHT:
The Olympia Academy.

32:01.829 --> 32:03.522

tropical island nation, yes?

- Serbia.

33:24.601 --> 33:25.910

33:25.911 --> 33:27.763

33:27.764 --> 33:29.622

Hmm.

33:43.105 --> 33:47.833

turbulent household.

33:47.834 --> 33:49.655

33:49.656 --> 33:52.147

33:52.148 --> 33:55.886
Sleepless nights, chaotic days.

33:55.887 --> 33:58.699

33:58.700 --> 34:00.361

34:00.362 --> 34:01.800
- Maurice...
- Stay with me now.

34:01.801 --> 34:04.107
This is where it turns naughty.

34:05.476 --> 34:06.848

Huh? Men of inferior intellect.

34:11.322 --> 34:14.773
But untethered by family,
they go zipping past you

34:14.774 --> 34:16.020
at the speed of light.

34:16.021 --> 34:18.322
And you're left...

34:18.322 --> 34:21.485
holding a mewling newborn,
asking yourself, "How the hell

34:21.485 --> 34:24.233
did I get here?"

34:24.234 --> 34:25.991
It's not as if I can turn back time.

34:25.992 --> 34:27.621
- Why are you torturing me?
- My cousin

34:27.623 --> 34:29.603
has a perfectly agreeable situation.

34:29.605 --> 34:31.744
He sends the mother
of his boy a stipend

34:31.745 --> 34:33.534
every month.

34:33.534 --> 34:35.036
Everybody happy.

34:35.036 --> 34:36.315
You're talking

34:36.315 --> 34:37.465
about a woman that I love

34:37.466 --> 34:39.349

brought into the world.

34:39.350 --> 34:41.427
I... Are you suggesting I abandon them?

34:41.428 --> 34:42.705
Abandon? No.

34:42.706 --> 34:44.303
Send money. Provide help.

34:44.304 --> 34:46.158

34:46.159 --> 34:48.683

35:23.869 --> 35:25.595

What is it?

35:27.034 --> 35:28.951
It's Father.

35:28.952 --> 35:31.123

36:09.581 --> 36:11.562
- Perhaps you read about it, Papa.
- Yeah?

36:11.563 --> 36:14.246
The Nobel is a major new prize.

36:14.247 --> 36:17.959
Maybe you will win one someday, yes?

Hmm.

36:48.315 --> 36:50.488
when I'm lost,

36:50.489 --> 36:53.588
it's always your voice
I hear in my head.

36:53.589 --> 36:55.824
Guiding me.

36:55.825 --> 36:59.820
Maja told me you were
angry about the letter

36:59.821 --> 37:01.417
I sent to your professor.

37:01.418 --> 37:04.485
I was only trying to help.

37:04.486 --> 37:06.084
I know.

37:06.085 --> 37:08.096
It was childish of me. I'm so sorry.
