WEBVTT

00:09.433 --> 00:10.567
- [coughing]
All right, guys.

00:10.667 --> 00:11.867
Put some pep in your step,

00:11.967 --> 00:13.300
'cause I want to get
some good seats.

00:13.400 --> 00:14.500
Whoo!
- Yeah, dude.

00:14.600 --> 00:15.900
Hey, no spoilers,
but this thing's

00:16.000 --> 00:17.167
supposed to have it all.

00:17.267 --> 00:19.200
Blood, sugar,
sex, magic.

00:19.300 --> 00:21.467
- Hey, if you guys figure
it out, do not tell me,

00:21.567 --> 00:22.833
because I want to be surprised.

00:22.933 --> 00:24.367
Sometimes I don't figure it out

00:24.467 --> 00:26.333
until the ride home or until
a few hours later.

00:26.433 --> 00:28.233
Or honestly, sometimes
it helps if you guys

00:28.333 --> 00:29.500
just tell me what happened.

00:29.600 --> 00:31.233
- Uh, my man,

00:31.333 --> 00:33.400
three for
"The People vs. Dom Dierkes"

00:33.500 --> 00:35.367
murder trial, please,
and we're students.

00:35.467 --> 00:38.033
- Uh, guys, we don't have
a student discount,

00:38.133 --> 00:39.667
and we don't sell tickets.

00:39.767 --> 00:41.633
- Oh, okay.
- Also, and I don't feel like

00:41.733 --> 00:43.400
doing this, but you aren't
giving me a choice.

00:43.500 --> 00:45.133
I have to arrest you.

00:45.233 --> 00:46.833
- Yeah, I don't think so, man.
I didn't vote.

00:46.933 --> 00:48.633
So I don't think
I could be arrested.

00:48.733 --> 00:50.100
- I can smell you
through the glass.

00:51.267 --> 00:52.467
You have a joint
behind your ear.

00:52.567 --> 00:54.667
- Do I?
- Yeah.

00:54.767 --> 00:56.367
- Yeah, that's my bad.
- Jesus.

00:56.467 --> 00:59.067
- And that guy
is holding a bong.

00:59.167 --> 01:02.567
- Oh.

01:02.667 --> 01:04.700
This actually isn't a bong.

01:04.800 --> 01:08.633
It is...Kombucha.

01:08.733 --> 01:10.700
- Drink it.

01:10.800 --> 01:12.967
- Some new--new age stuff.
- Yeah.

01:13.067 --> 01:15.833
- Yoga people drink it,
so--and I'm one of them.

01:15.933 --> 01:17.467
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh, yeah.

01:22.200 --> 01:23.333
- It's thick.

01:23.433 --> 01:26.333
[The Skinny Boys' "Jock Box"]

01:26.433 --> 01:27.433
*

01:27.533 --> 01:29.967
- * I'm fresh

01:30.067 --> 01:31.967
* You gotta, you gotta,
you gotta *

01:32.067 --> 01:34.067
* Gotta be fresh

01:36.300 --> 01:38.633
- Mr. DeMamp,

01:38.733 --> 01:42.600
you've got more DUIs than
my grandson can count up to.

01:42.700 --> 01:43.833
- Oh, no.

01:43.933 --> 01:45.267
Did he have,
like, an accident?

01:45.367 --> 01:47.133
'Cause I heard--like,

01:47.233 --> 01:49.433
this one construction worker
got a bolt in his head,

01:49.533 --> 01:50.667
and then he couldn't count.

01:50.767 --> 01:52.700
- He's three, you dummy.

01:52.800 --> 01:54.633
Now, my point is,

01:54.733 --> 01:56.533
that the only thing
you've accomplished

01:56.633 --> 01:59.267
is getting arrested
for being an idiot.

01:59.367 --> 02:02.067
Is that what you want
your legacy to be?

02:02.133 --> 02:03.267
And you,

02:03.367 --> 02:05.400
you look like every other

02:05.500 --> 02:08.067
self-centered,
dope-smoking kid with your--

02:08.133 --> 02:11.800
with your cool T-shirt
and your pervert mustache.

02:11.900 --> 02:13.500
- I look weird without it,
but thank you

02:13.600 --> 02:14.900
for the compliment
on the T-shirt.

02:15.067 --> 02:16.133
That's very sweet of you.

02:16.233 --> 02:17.367
- When was the last time

02:17.467 --> 02:18.767
you did something
for someone else

02:18.867 --> 02:21.300
rather than smoking
that damn hashish?

02:21.400 --> 02:24.800
And you, you look like

02:24.900 --> 02:27.433
you could actually be
an upstanding citizen.

02:27.533 --> 02:28.800
- Thank you.

02:28.900 --> 02:30.567
- What do you want to do
with your life, son?

02:30.667 --> 02:34.167
- Uh, well, sir, one day
I hope to be city councilman.

02:34.267 --> 02:36.500
- Well, there's a war
on drugs out there,

02:36.600 --> 02:38.767
and you're on
the wrong side of it.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.633
I want the three of you

02:40.733 --> 02:43.067
to go to a
Narcotics Anonymous meeting,

02:43.167 --> 02:46.467
and perhaps getting
a firsthand look at how drugs

02:46.567 --> 02:50.267
rip people's lives apart
will do you some good.

02:50.367 --> 02:53.100
- Thank you,
honorable Judge "Browntown."

02:54.500 --> 02:55.633
- Judge, I just
want you to know

02:55.733 --> 02:56.900
I'm gonna
take full advantage

02:57.067 --> 02:58.400
of these N.A. classes.

02:58.500 --> 03:00.733
- Well, I'm glad
to hear that, son.

03:00.833 --> 03:02.167
- Yeah, I'm gonna go undercover

03:02.267 --> 03:04.133
and sniff out some
primo intel for you.

03:04.233 --> 03:06.633
Hopefully we can put
an end to this Rancho drug war

03:06.733 --> 03:08.300
once and for all, right?

03:08.400 --> 03:11.267
- Do not do that.

03:11.367 --> 03:13.267
- Right...
side of the law.

03:13.367 --> 03:15.100
I'm doing it, yeah.
- No, don't.

03:15.200 --> 03:16.800
- [sighs]
I need to smoke some weed.

03:16.900 --> 03:19.433
- Court-mandated meetings,
am I right?

03:19.533 --> 03:21.100
What are you in for, bud?

03:21.200 --> 03:23.767
- Ah, I'm actually just
observing the meeting.

03:23.867 --> 03:25.067
I'm a journalist.

03:25.167 --> 03:27.067
- Oh, well,
I dream journal, so--

03:27.133 --> 03:30.733
- No, I'm--I'm a reporter
for "VICE" magazine.

03:30.833 --> 03:33.967
I'm writing a story
about meth abuse.

03:34.067 --> 03:36.467
To be perfectly honest,
I'm looking for an addict

03:36.567 --> 03:38.767
that would agree
to be profiled.

03:38.867 --> 03:40.100
See you guys in the meeting.

03:40.200 --> 03:42.533
[gentle chimes playing]

03:42.633 --> 03:44.267
- Yes, you will.

03:46.200 --> 03:47.367
- Got a large group tonight.

03:47.467 --> 03:49.367
- Whoo!
Yeah, recovery!

03:49.467 --> 03:51.067
- Welcome, my name's Tim,

03:51.167 --> 03:52.967
and, uh, when I first
walked through the doors--

03:53.067 --> 03:54.867
- Dude, I just figured out

03:54.967 --> 03:58.200
what I'm gonna do to, like,
have my legacy be badass.

03:58.300 --> 04:02.633
My face on the cover
of "VICE" magazine.

04:02.733 --> 04:05.067
- Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

04:05.100 --> 04:06.233
But the only thing is,

04:06.333 --> 04:07.633
is that guy wants
a crazy meth head.

04:07.733 --> 04:08.867
- Mm-hmm.

04:08.967 --> 04:10.400
- You just occasionally
smoke weed.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.067
- Except for every day
and at night, also.

04:12.167 --> 04:14.267
- Yeah, I'm just saying,
all you've ever done is weed

04:14.367 --> 04:16.600
and, you know,
beer and mushrooms

04:16.700 --> 04:19.367
and acid and, you know,
ecstasy, Molly...

04:19.467 --> 04:20.833
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
- Some lean, sizzurp.

04:20.933 --> 04:23.200
- Yep.
- But other than that...

04:23.300 --> 04:24.533
- Did you say something?

04:24.633 --> 04:26.067
Would you like
to come up and share?

04:26.133 --> 04:27.900
- I'm--I'm cool.
I'm not an addict.

04:28.067 --> 04:29.433
- [scoffs]
Okay.

04:29.533 --> 04:31.100
If that's what
your heart believes.

04:31.200 --> 04:32.433
- Come on!

04:32.533 --> 04:34.433
I don't have
a problem, okay?

04:34.533 --> 04:35.933
I'm fine!

04:36.067 --> 04:37.900
Can we go, please?
I need to smoke a bowl.

04:38.067 --> 04:39.567
- No, I'm gonna stay here.
I have work to do.

04:39.667 --> 04:40.833
- Okay, yeah,
I gotta go.

04:40.933 --> 04:43.433
I gotta get some fresh air
really quick.

04:43.533 --> 04:46.433
[chill music]

04:46.533 --> 04:48.100
*

04:48.200 --> 04:50.100
- Dang, what's up
with all these snacks?

04:50.200 --> 04:51.733
[awkward laugh]

04:53.167 --> 04:54.333
What's up, man?
I'm Shaunders.

04:54.433 --> 04:55.700
Good to meet you, dude.

04:55.800 --> 04:57.167
Can you believe
these marks in there?

04:57.267 --> 04:59.667
Talking about,
"I wanna get high."

04:59.767 --> 05:01.567
"I wish I was still high."

05:01.667 --> 05:03.233
[bleep], go get high!

05:03.333 --> 05:04.800
Know what I mean?
But I'll tell you what.

05:04.900 --> 05:06.267
I, uh, probably
gonna need something

05:06.367 --> 05:07.933
a little stronger
than this coffee

05:08.067 --> 05:10.233
if I'ma get through this
meeting; for real, though.

05:10.333 --> 05:12.367
Do you have a hookup?

05:12.467 --> 05:14.800
- Are you seriously asking me
for drugs at a N.A. meeting?

05:14.900 --> 05:16.333
- Did I stutter?

05:16.433 --> 05:18.900
- Dude, I've been sober
for eight months.

05:19.067 --> 05:20.800
- Oh, you gonna take it
personal, okay.

05:20.900 --> 05:22.633
Please, man, you look
like a old-ass,

05:22.733 --> 05:24.933
whack Peter Pan,
so, like, [buzzes].

05:27.067 --> 05:28.333
- Hey, "fyi,"

05:28.433 --> 05:30.800
normally what I say here,
I want to stay here,

05:30.900 --> 05:33.733
but if any of this lands
in "VICE" magazine...

05:35.733 --> 05:37.400
- I'm actually
looking for someone

05:37.500 --> 05:40.567
who's in the grip of addiction,
struggling to get out.

05:40.667 --> 05:42.467
You seem like you're getting
your life together.

05:42.567 --> 05:44.067
Linda:
My name is Linda.

05:44.167 --> 05:47.300
I went to that bar,
Ed's Jug House, to score,

05:47.400 --> 05:50.400
and I left my kids
alone in the car.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.533
Social Services
took them from me,

05:52.633 --> 05:55.867
and now I just want
to see my kids again.

05:55.967 --> 05:57.633
[crying]

05:57.733 --> 05:59.400
- [crying]

05:59.500 --> 06:01.933
Oh, God!

06:02.067 --> 06:04.067
Oh, you could sit down,
'cause that actually--

06:04.167 --> 06:06.367
sit down right now--
'cause that inspired me.

06:06.467 --> 06:09.600
I recently lost myself
to meth once again,

06:09.700 --> 06:12.133
and just like this girl
who seems like

06:12.233 --> 06:14.767
she has it all together now

06:14.867 --> 06:17.433
and is fully
on the road to recovery,

06:17.533 --> 06:19.367
I was also at Ed's Jug House,

06:19.467 --> 06:21.433
and I...

06:21.533 --> 06:23.200
I ate a puppy.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.367
And on top
of that, I, uh...

06:25.467 --> 06:27.433
sucked a bunch of [bleep].

06:27.533 --> 06:29.100
I'm good at it,
so I could just

06:29.200 --> 06:30.433
really get in there
and just...

06:30.533 --> 06:32.167
[gagging]

06:32.267 --> 06:35.433
Big ones, small ones,
girthy ones,

06:35.533 --> 06:38.533
ones that looked like
it had, like, alopecia.

06:38.633 --> 06:40.967
And that's my story.

06:44.267 --> 06:48.100
[chill music]

06:48.200 --> 06:49.467
- Did I miss anything?

06:49.567 --> 06:51.133
Psych!
I hate this shit.

06:51.233 --> 06:52.700
I'm out the game.
It's been a long time.

06:52.800 --> 06:54.367
I'm trying to hop back in,
so I'm wondering

06:54.467 --> 06:56.167
if you got any connects.

06:56.267 --> 06:59.533
- It ain't smart to be
asking questions about Zippo.

06:59.633 --> 07:01.867
- Zip--Zippo?
You say Zippo?

07:01.967 --> 07:04.400
You tell Zippo...

07:04.500 --> 07:06.600
Shaunders.

07:08.800 --> 07:10.300
- Just need a smoke, man.

07:10.400 --> 07:12.333
Jeez, get off my back.

07:14.833 --> 07:17.267
- I can't--I can't--
I can't do this.

07:17.367 --> 07:18.933
- Mr. Buckley?

07:19.067 --> 07:20.167
- Yeah--no.

07:20.267 --> 07:21.633
- [laughing]
It is you!

07:21.733 --> 07:23.067
- What?
Oh, hi.

07:23.167 --> 07:25.067
- Wow, Mr. Buckley, hey.
- Can I help you?

07:25.100 --> 07:26.900
- I haven't seen you
since drama camp.

07:27.067 --> 07:29.300
It's me, it's Blake Henderson.
- Oh, yes.

07:29.400 --> 07:32.633
- I, uh, I was Lenny's, uh,
understudy's backup's stand-in.

07:32.733 --> 07:34.367
- Okay, yes, yeah,
and you were wonderful.

07:34.467 --> 07:36.167
Wonderful performance.
- What are you doing?

07:36.267 --> 07:38.467
You, uh, going--
going into the meeting, or...?

07:38.567 --> 07:40.967
- I just can't seem
to drag myself in there.

07:41.067 --> 07:43.433
They're such dreaded affairs,
aren't they?

07:43.533 --> 07:46.167
- Well, now that I
have you here,

07:46.267 --> 07:48.833
I'd love to just pick your brain
about acting, right?

07:48.933 --> 07:50.600
Get it--just write it
in my little notebook.

07:50.700 --> 07:51.833
- Well, write this down.

07:51.933 --> 07:53.100
- All right.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.100
- "Give it up."

07:54.200 --> 07:55.667
- What, you quit?

07:55.767 --> 07:57.733
I mean, you're like,
basically the main reason

07:57.833 --> 08:00.700
I am an actor, I mean,

08:00.800 --> 08:02.333
ever since I saw
the play you wrote,

08:02.433 --> 08:04.633
uh, "McBreath."

08:04.733 --> 08:06.833
- I curse you,
Jen D'Angelo.

08:06.933 --> 08:08.500
- Yeah!
- Yes, I wrote it, yeah.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.567
Um, I'm afraid there was
a little bit of an incident

08:10.667 --> 08:13.133
at my last run of
"Hedwig and the Angry Inch"

08:13.233 --> 08:14.600
at the Rancho Playhouse.

08:14.700 --> 08:15.733
And I really don't
want to talk about it,

08:15.833 --> 08:16.767
but it was good
to see you.

08:16.867 --> 08:18.267
- Oh, my gosh, what happened?

08:18.367 --> 08:19.267
I know you don't want
to talk about it,

08:19.367 --> 08:20.533
but what happened?

08:20.633 --> 08:22.067
- Several of the actors refused

08:22.133 --> 08:24.900
to call me by
my character's name offstage,

08:25.067 --> 08:28.400
which,
for a method actor as I am--

08:28.500 --> 08:29.800
that was unacceptable.

08:29.900 --> 08:31.233
- Oh, right.
- I wound up...

08:31.333 --> 08:34.200
striking several
of those children...

08:34.300 --> 08:35.600
repeatedly.

08:35.700 --> 08:36.967
- Oh, that's dumb.

08:37.067 --> 08:38.233
- Yeah, I know, I--

08:38.333 --> 08:39.900
- I mean, of the kids.

08:40.067 --> 08:43.200
- Yes, and then of course once
acting was taken away from me,

08:43.300 --> 08:44.900
I turned to drugs.

08:45.067 --> 08:46.700
They were the only thing
that gave me that high

08:46.800 --> 08:49.400
that once, the stage gave me.

08:49.500 --> 08:52.700
- You know, I want
to do you a favor.

08:52.800 --> 08:53.933
- Thank you.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.267
- All right.
Excuse me, Linda--

08:55.367 --> 08:57.133
- No, hey, hey!
Hey, so you probably

08:57.233 --> 08:58.867
want to write that article
about me, right?

08:58.967 --> 09:01.333
After you heard the shocking
and scandalous tale

09:01.433 --> 09:04.133
that I just...spoke upon?

09:04.233 --> 09:06.300
- Actually, Linda's story
spoke to me a lot.

09:06.400 --> 09:07.867
- Linda's did?
- Yeah.

09:07.967 --> 09:09.267
- But she didn't suck

09:09.367 --> 09:11.167
a ton of little [bleep]
in her story.

09:11.267 --> 09:12.433
- Yeah, listen, Adam,

09:12.533 --> 09:13.867
you seem a little
thick in the middle

09:13.967 --> 09:15.433
for a meth addict,
to be honest with you.

09:15.533 --> 09:17.200
- Okay, well, this is
a safe place, so shut up.

09:17.300 --> 09:18.600
- I gotta talk to Linda.

09:18.700 --> 09:21.067
- Oh, God.

09:21.100 --> 09:22.567
- What are you doing?
- Oh, God!

09:22.667 --> 09:24.700
Oh, your hateful words!
It's a trigger.

09:24.800 --> 09:26.900
It's a--it's a trigger for me,
and I'm gonna go do meth.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.767
- Okay, I'm sorry.

09:28.867 --> 09:30.233
Did I upset you that much?

09:30.333 --> 09:32.167
- Nothing that
a little meth won't fix,

09:32.267 --> 09:34.433
and that's what I'm gonna
go do right now.

09:34.533 --> 09:36.500
Bye-bye, Linda.
I'm doing meth.

09:36.600 --> 09:37.500
- Okay, I'm gonna go.

09:37.600 --> 09:38.733
- Actually, Adam,

09:38.833 --> 09:40.367
would you mind
if I follow along?

09:40.467 --> 09:42.167
If you're gonna do meth,
I actually would like

09:42.267 --> 09:43.700
to get a firsthand
look at that if you--

09:43.800 --> 09:45.200
you don't mind
me shadowing you.

09:45.300 --> 09:47.233
- So you want to do
the article about me?

09:47.333 --> 09:49.567
- I mean, maybe--
- Yes!

09:49.667 --> 09:51.200
Yeah, okay, come on.

09:51.300 --> 09:52.433
Let's ride.

09:52.533 --> 09:54.067
My condolences
for your children.

09:54.133 --> 09:55.267
That was a sad story.

09:55.367 --> 09:57.067
Mine was more sad, though.
Whoo!

09:57.100 --> 09:59.067
* *

10:03.600 --> 10:05.500
- Huh?
Pretty cool, huh?

10:05.600 --> 10:06.767
- No, no, no, no.
- Come on,

10:06.867 --> 10:08.000
I wanna show you something.

10:08.100 --> 10:09.267
Come on.

10:09.367 --> 10:10.967
Jesus, are you kidding me?
Come on.

10:11.067 --> 10:13.233
- Guys, I'm sorry,
but you can't be in here.

10:13.333 --> 10:15.567
We've got rehearsal
in about five minutes.

10:15.667 --> 10:17.933
- And I need but four, okay?

10:18.033 --> 10:19.900
This is Mr. Buckley,

10:20.000 --> 10:21.967
Rancho Cucamonga acting legend.

10:22.067 --> 10:23.833
Have you heard of him?
- No.

10:23.933 --> 10:25.933
- Well, we would like to
perform a scene from his play,

10:26.033 --> 10:27.433
which I'm sure
you've heard of,

10:27.533 --> 10:29.067
"McBreath."

10:29.167 --> 10:30.300
- Fine.

10:30.400 --> 10:32.133
- Excellent.
[laughs]

10:32.233 --> 10:33.400
- Wh--wh--what are you doing?

10:33.500 --> 10:35.100
- All right, everybody.

10:35.200 --> 10:38.333
Um, I will be playing
the role of Angela,

10:38.433 --> 10:42.500
and he shall be playing
the role of McBreath, our hero.

10:42.600 --> 10:45.233
Our scene starts
in a crowded bus.

10:45.333 --> 10:47.467
Angela enters.

10:47.567 --> 10:50.000
[as Angela]
Excuse me, pardon me.

10:50.100 --> 10:51.667
- Blake, I can't do this.

10:51.767 --> 10:53.000
- Oh, excuse me, pardon me.

10:53.100 --> 10:55.033
- I can't do this without drugs.

10:55.133 --> 10:57.067
- Excuse me!

10:57.167 --> 10:59.700
Excuse me.

11:01.567 --> 11:04.467
- Here, take my seat.

11:04.567 --> 11:06.900
- Oh, you are too kind.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.400
I'm Angela.

11:08.500 --> 11:11.133
- I'm Leonard, Angela,

11:11.233 --> 11:13.767
but everyone calls me McBreath.

11:13.867 --> 11:15.933
- McBreath?

11:16.067 --> 11:19.933
- In seventh grade,
we played spin the bottle,

11:20.067 --> 11:22.967
and it landed
on Jen D'Angelo.

11:23.067 --> 11:24.933
We kissed, and then she told me

11:25.067 --> 11:29.200
my breath smelled like
McDonald's cheeseburgers.

11:29.300 --> 11:30.900
Then she got everyone

11:31.067 --> 11:35.367
to chant,
"McBreath, McBreath, McBreath!"

11:35.467 --> 11:40.200
I curse you,
Jen D'Angelo!

11:40.300 --> 11:44.633
I curse you
with all the venom of my heart!

11:44.733 --> 11:46.067
I hate you.

11:46.133 --> 11:47.700
I hate you, I hate you!

11:47.800 --> 11:49.367
- Okay.
- Oh, God.

11:49.467 --> 11:52.533
- Well, I like cheeseburgers.

11:52.633 --> 11:55.433
And I think the name
McBreath is cool.

11:55.533 --> 11:57.100
- You do?

11:57.200 --> 12:01.833
- Let me smell your breath,
McBreath.

12:01.933 --> 12:04.500
- If you must.

12:04.600 --> 12:07.200
[breathing heavily]

12:07.300 --> 12:10.067
- Mmm.

12:10.133 --> 12:12.733
I'm loving it.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.600
- Wait, so McBreath
isn't even, like,

12:15.700 --> 12:17.333
a take-off on "Macbeth"?

12:17.433 --> 12:18.867
- It's an original piece.

12:18.967 --> 12:20.533
Not everything
has to be a remake.

12:20.633 --> 12:22.900
Ders:
Yo, boss.

12:23.067 --> 12:25.767
You still got a thirst
for putting away bad guys?

12:25.867 --> 12:29.767
'Cause I got the name of the
biggest drug dealer in Rancho.

12:29.867 --> 12:31.200
Zippo.

12:31.300 --> 12:32.267
- Zippo Tomlin?

12:32.367 --> 12:34.267
- Yeah, I think so.

12:34.367 --> 12:37.200
- Son, do you even know
who Tomlin is?

12:37.300 --> 12:40.500
- I--I know I'm getting bits
and pieces of information.

12:40.600 --> 12:44.067
- He's the leader of the most
brutal biker gang in the state.

12:44.100 --> 12:47.167
Now, do you know how
he got the nickname Zippo?

12:47.267 --> 12:49.333
- From one of his two best
friends that he lives with.

12:49.433 --> 12:51.100
- I don't think so, son.
- Okay.

12:51.200 --> 12:53.100
- It's because he likes
to set people on fire.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.433
- Oh, my God.

12:55.533 --> 12:56.900
Dude's dick burned off!

12:57.067 --> 12:58.767
- That was a woman.
- She naked?

12:58.867 --> 13:00.500
- Yes, she was.
- Sick.

13:00.600 --> 13:01.900
I mean, that's sick.
That is sick.

13:02.067 --> 13:03.367
- Yes, it is, son.

13:03.467 --> 13:05.500
Unless you want to have
a massive skin graft,

13:05.600 --> 13:08.167
I suggest you stop
playing dress-up!

13:08.267 --> 13:09.900
- Yes, sir, but it was an honor

13:10.067 --> 13:11.467
to work for you, sir.

13:11.567 --> 13:13.100
- Shut up, you twit.
- Okay.

13:14.933 --> 13:16.067
[suspenseful music]

13:16.167 --> 13:17.633
[phone line trilling]

13:17.733 --> 13:20.133
- Yeah, listen.
Just a heads up.

13:20.233 --> 13:23.533
There's some annoying kid
that might give us a small...

13:23.633 --> 13:25.833
problem.

13:25.933 --> 13:27.867
- Keep an eye on him.

13:35.400 --> 13:36.533
- Get in the [bleep] van.

13:36.633 --> 13:38.400
Zippo wants to see you.

13:39.500 --> 13:41.400
- Like, seven or eight dicks.

13:41.500 --> 13:42.933
- What up?
- That's how many that I've--

13:43.067 --> 13:44.267
Hey, what up?
- That's so many.

13:44.367 --> 13:45.933
- Yeah, that's a lot,
you know.

13:46.067 --> 13:47.633
- Hey, uh, I don't know if
you wanted to take a shower,

13:47.733 --> 13:49.400
but my old teacher's using it,
so just give him a minute.

13:49.500 --> 13:50.800
- That is weird,

13:50.900 --> 13:52.400
but I actually
don't have time,

13:52.500 --> 13:54.267
'cause I'm scrounging up
money to buy meth.

13:54.367 --> 13:56.067
- Mm, okay.
Can I talk to you for a second?

13:56.133 --> 13:59.433
- Found one.
Okay, "VICE" guy, let's roll.

13:59.533 --> 14:01.600
We buying meth! Ooh.

14:01.700 --> 14:04.200
Oh, I'm getting that pre-meth
jitters, baby, let's roll!

14:04.300 --> 14:05.933
- Seems stupid.
Seems really dumb.

14:06.067 --> 14:07.500
You're enabling him!

14:09.400 --> 14:11.867
- Whoo!
I needed that scrub-down.

14:11.967 --> 14:15.100
Oh, I borrowed somebody's
grizzled toothbrush,

14:15.200 --> 14:17.500
but it was way better
than the Taco Bell napkins

14:17.600 --> 14:18.833
I've been brushing
my teeth with.

14:18.933 --> 14:20.133
- Okay, I'll let Ders know.

14:20.233 --> 14:21.967
Hey, Mr. Buckley,
I have the perfect role.

14:22.067 --> 14:23.200
No audition required.

14:23.300 --> 14:24.667
- My kind of role.
- Okay.

14:24.767 --> 14:25.933
What do you think of this?

14:26.067 --> 14:28.600
The role of kind of a seedy,

14:28.700 --> 14:30.667
dark, meth dealer.

14:30.767 --> 14:32.867
- Is this a new piece
they're opening

14:32.967 --> 14:34.133
at the Rancho Playhouse?

14:34.233 --> 14:36.700
- No, no,
Ed's Jug House, the bar.

14:36.800 --> 14:39.067
- Okay, a Jug House meth dealer,
yes, yes.

14:39.100 --> 14:40.800
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, so--
- That is a challenge.

14:40.900 --> 14:42.333
- Yeah, yeah.
- This is a good role.

14:42.433 --> 14:44.100
I could really sink
my teeth into this.

14:44.200 --> 14:46.667
- Great, I'll, uh,
pay for your new headshots.

14:46.767 --> 14:48.067
I'll take them if you want.

14:48.133 --> 14:50.200
- If anybody tries
to take my picture,

14:50.300 --> 14:51.867
I'll break their face,
you understand me?

14:51.967 --> 14:53.100
- Mm-hmm.
- And who is this

14:53.200 --> 14:54.600
Mr. Buckley character?

14:54.700 --> 14:58.067
They call me Johnny Glass.

14:58.100 --> 14:59.733
- Mr. Glass it is, sure.

14:59.833 --> 15:01.833
*

15:06.667 --> 15:08.533
- Whoo!
[laughs]

15:08.633 --> 15:10.167
I told my boss
that some cop

15:10.267 --> 15:13.167
was looking for him,
and he wants to meet you.

15:13.267 --> 15:14.600
- You think I'm a cop?

15:14.700 --> 15:16.133
Oh, my God, thank you.

15:16.233 --> 15:17.933
You don't know what
that means to me, man.

15:18.067 --> 15:19.267
I'm not a cop.

15:19.367 --> 15:20.967
I work in phone sales
like a dummy.

15:21.067 --> 15:23.233
- [menacing laughter]

15:23.333 --> 15:26.300
Zippo's gonna have fun with you.

15:26.400 --> 15:28.267
Yo, Kaner, take us around back.

15:28.367 --> 15:29.767
Whoo!

15:29.867 --> 15:31.100
Come on, aren't you
guys excited?

15:31.200 --> 15:33.067
Whoo!
This is outlaw shit!

15:33.167 --> 15:34.400
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

15:34.500 --> 15:35.633
Come on!

15:35.733 --> 15:37.100
- Okay, listen up.

15:37.200 --> 15:38.333
You wanna get high?

15:38.433 --> 15:39.767
Real high?

15:39.867 --> 15:42.467
This shit will get you higher

15:42.567 --> 15:43.833
than God's...

15:43.933 --> 15:45.100
frozen...

15:45.200 --> 15:46.333
semen.

15:46.433 --> 15:48.100
- Ooh, whoa.

15:48.200 --> 15:49.900
That's so high.

15:50.067 --> 15:51.133
- That's ridiculous.

15:51.233 --> 15:52.633
- That's how high I wanna be.

15:52.733 --> 15:54.600
So what I have here

15:54.700 --> 15:56.333
is 16 smackeroos,

15:56.433 --> 15:58.633
so if I could get
$16 worth of meth.

15:58.733 --> 16:00.167
- What?

16:00.267 --> 16:01.967
That's not enough money
for my meth.

16:02.067 --> 16:03.400
I'm sorry,
what do you think this is?

16:03.500 --> 16:05.500
Rock candy?
I'm selling meth!

16:05.600 --> 16:06.733
- I want it.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.367
- Cough up some more, kid,

16:08.467 --> 16:10.067
and we're in business.

16:10.100 --> 16:12.267
- I'll do anything for the meth.

16:12.367 --> 16:16.600
- Okay, then,
you can work the rest

16:16.700 --> 16:18.433
out on my [bleep].

16:18.533 --> 16:20.067
[zips]

16:21.900 --> 16:23.533
- Okay,
I'm coming, I'm coming.

16:23.633 --> 16:26.067
I'm going--ow!
You stepped on my foot.

16:26.133 --> 16:28.867
- Heard you've been
asking about the Zip.

16:28.967 --> 16:30.733
- Boss, I heard
he was a cop.

16:30.833 --> 16:32.133
- No?
- Mm-hmm.

16:32.233 --> 16:35.533
- I also heard
that you're a cop.

16:35.633 --> 16:38.733
- Yeah, he just told you
I was a cop, but I'm not, okay?

16:38.833 --> 16:40.133
And I'm actually flattered
you guys think I'm a cop.

16:40.233 --> 16:41.400
Trust me, I'm not.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.633
You give me one of those vests,

16:42.733 --> 16:43.633
let's go carjack.

16:43.733 --> 16:44.867
Let's go ride or die, man,

16:44.967 --> 16:46.300
I'll be like,
"You mean-mugging me?

16:46.400 --> 16:48.467
I'm mean-muggin you,
my--my man, my ma--"

16:48.567 --> 16:49.700
- Shh, silence.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.133
- I was just showing you
what I can do.

16:51.233 --> 16:53.133
- I will cutty cut you.

16:53.233 --> 16:54.567
- Have at it, kid.

16:54.667 --> 16:56.600
- Okay, uh...
- Yeah.

16:56.700 --> 16:59.133
Maybe take it to
the bathroom, or--

16:59.233 --> 17:01.067
- You know what?
On second thought,

17:01.133 --> 17:02.467
I want this to be great for you,

17:02.567 --> 17:03.867
so I'm gonna go to the restroom

17:03.967 --> 17:05.367
and stretch my jaw out

17:05.467 --> 17:06.833
by stuffing it
full of toilet paper.

17:06.933 --> 17:09.433
That's how I give a good hummer.

17:09.533 --> 17:11.167
- Oh, you ain't going
anywhere, round boy.

17:11.267 --> 17:12.700
- Round boy?

17:12.800 --> 17:14.200
- You see,
we don't really like cops

17:14.300 --> 17:15.700
around here, man.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.567
Not at Ed's Jug House,
you understand?

17:17.667 --> 17:18.833
- I know, I promise you
I'm a regular normal guy--

17:18.933 --> 17:20.600
Mr. Buckley:
Hey, you suck [bleep] [bleep].

17:20.700 --> 17:22.067
- I work at a regular job
with an outdated business model.

17:22.167 --> 17:23.700
Mr. Buckley:
Then we got a double [bleep]

17:23.800 --> 17:24.933
suck it up
at this bitch!

17:25.067 --> 17:26.933
- Suck somebody's [bleep]?

17:27.067 --> 17:29.067
What is going on out there?

17:29.100 --> 17:32.067
- You suck my [bleep],
and you get the balls, okay?

17:32.133 --> 17:34.567
- Who in the [bleep] are you?

17:34.667 --> 17:36.267
- Who in the [bleep]
are you?

17:36.367 --> 17:38.867
- Zippo.
Who in the [bleep] are you?

17:38.967 --> 17:40.100
- Johnny Glass!

17:40.200 --> 17:41.533
- Ders, hey!

17:41.633 --> 17:43.167
Do you have any money
that I could borrow?

17:43.267 --> 17:44.733
- Yeah, Ders,
who are these guys?

17:44.833 --> 17:46.067
- This is Zippo.
He's, like, a meth kingpin.

17:46.167 --> 17:47.567
These are his friends.

17:47.667 --> 17:48.700
They like to light people
on fire, for real.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.200
- How do you chumps
know this cop?

17:50.300 --> 17:52.067
Who's this dipshit
taking pictures?

17:52.167 --> 17:54.067
- He's with me.
- And for the last time,

17:54.100 --> 17:55.233
I'm not a cop, okay?

17:55.333 --> 17:56.867
Obviously, I should
probably be one.

17:56.967 --> 17:58.533
I mean, you should
see me frisk.

17:58.633 --> 17:59.767
- Okay, stop.
Wait, hold on.

17:59.867 --> 18:01.233
All right,
let's get out of here.

18:01.333 --> 18:02.733
I think this is, like,
real life, Mr. Buckley.

18:02.833 --> 18:03.733
Let's go.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.800
- I am Johnny Glass!

18:05.900 --> 18:07.167
- Ugh! Ow!

18:07.267 --> 18:09.300
- Johnny Glass.
[laughs]

18:09.400 --> 18:10.667
- Oh, is that
funny to you?

18:10.767 --> 18:13.067
- Nobody sells around here
unless I say so.

18:13.167 --> 18:14.733
- Oh, is that so?
- Nobody gets their

18:14.833 --> 18:18.300
[bleep] sucked in here,
unless the Big Z,

18:18.400 --> 18:20.533
Zippo, says so.

18:20.633 --> 18:21.533
- Yeah, I'm with Zippo
on that one.

18:21.633 --> 18:23.067
- Shut the [bleep] up!

18:23.100 --> 18:24.733
- Shut the [bleep] up,
and you shut the [bleep] up.

18:24.833 --> 18:27.133
Why don't you say this?
"Can I suck your [bleep]?"

18:27.233 --> 18:28.733
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

18:28.833 --> 18:30.133
Here's a little
coming attraction

18:30.233 --> 18:31.867
of what's gonna shoot out.

18:31.967 --> 18:33.967
- You mother--ah!

18:34.067 --> 18:35.833
- Oh!

18:35.933 --> 18:37.800
[laughs]

18:37.900 --> 18:39.333
Get down, you little bitches.

18:39.433 --> 18:41.167
Come on, get down, okay.

18:41.267 --> 18:42.800
'Cause this is my day!

18:42.900 --> 18:45.067
This is my territory!

18:45.100 --> 18:46.233
[high-pitched scream]

18:46.333 --> 18:47.567
Oh, my God!

18:47.667 --> 18:48.867
That was a real knife.

18:48.967 --> 18:49.867
Can some--can we talk
to the prop master?

18:49.967 --> 18:51.233
Here, take this.

18:51.333 --> 18:53.167
- The wad is blown,
the wad is blown.

18:53.267 --> 18:54.867
[police siren blaring]
Don't move, Zippo!

18:54.967 --> 18:56.700
You're under arrest.
- Get your hands up!

18:56.800 --> 18:58.567
- How could you do me
like that, Sandman?

18:58.667 --> 19:00.600
Supposed to be me
and you, brother.

19:00.700 --> 19:03.200
I got your daughter
a bounce house, man!

19:03.300 --> 19:04.667
- Take it out,
take it out, take it out.

19:04.767 --> 19:06.433
Ow, ow, ow, don't wiggle
it, don't wiggle it!

19:06.533 --> 19:07.700
Don't--
- Ah!

19:07.800 --> 19:10.233
- Well, it was
a little scary,

19:10.333 --> 19:12.933
but also an honor,
your honor, to help

19:13.067 --> 19:15.600
bring down the biggest
drug kingpin in Rancho.

19:15.700 --> 19:17.233
- We did it.
- Yeah, I think we can

19:17.333 --> 19:20.100
honestly say that
we're better people for it.

19:20.200 --> 19:23.133
And I know for a fact,
now we're better friends.

19:23.233 --> 19:24.633
- Yes.
- Yeah, we are.

19:24.733 --> 19:28.700
- Well, I'm glad you got
something out of it,

19:28.800 --> 19:31.533
because you just
blew a six-year

19:31.633 --> 19:33.967
undercover operation
that was trying to take out

19:34.067 --> 19:36.467
an entire international cartel!

19:36.567 --> 19:38.967
If anything,
Rancho's meth problem

19:39.067 --> 19:40.233
will only get worse.

19:40.333 --> 19:42.100
There will be a power struggle

19:42.200 --> 19:44.967
to replace Zippo,
which will lead to a drug war.

19:45.067 --> 19:47.767
And I want you boys
to be fully aware

19:47.867 --> 19:52.933
that there is blood
on your hands.

19:53.067 --> 19:54.300
- Hmm, okay.

19:54.400 --> 19:55.633
That seems a little...

19:55.733 --> 19:57.733
- It does.
- Just a little bit harsh.

19:57.833 --> 19:59.067
- Dramatic?
- Yeah.

19:59.167 --> 20:00.400
I mean, we were just
smoking weed.

20:00.500 --> 20:01.700
You could've wrote us a fine,

20:01.800 --> 20:03.367
instead of this
whole stupid shenanigan.

20:03.467 --> 20:05.267
- Get the hell out of here!

20:05.367 --> 20:06.533
- Okay.
- All right.

20:06.633 --> 20:07.700
- Thank you,
Judge "Browntown."

20:07.800 --> 20:09.100
- It's Brownton!

20:09.200 --> 20:13.867
- Is it?

20:13.967 --> 20:16.167
- * He's insane

20:22.500 --> 20:24.200
- Ladies and gentlemen,
we invite you

20:24.300 --> 20:26.133
to please take your seats

20:26.233 --> 20:28.367
as the thrilling conclusion of

20:28.467 --> 20:31.200
"Attention Whore:
The Adam DeMamp Story"

20:31.300 --> 20:33.133
begins now.

20:33.233 --> 20:34.633
Lights.

20:34.733 --> 20:36.233
- What's gonna happen?

20:36.333 --> 20:38.033
- I don't know.

20:38.133 --> 20:39.967
[both applauding]

20:40.067 --> 20:41.967
- Whoo!

20:42.067 --> 20:45.067
[continues clapping]

20:50.767 --> 20:53.267
[baby-talking as Adam]
Why people no love me?

20:53.367 --> 20:56.833
Maybe if I pretend
to do methamphetamine drugs,

20:56.933 --> 20:58.467
then people will love me.

20:58.567 --> 21:00.167
Mm-hmm.

21:00.267 --> 21:01.400
[gentle chimes playing]

21:01.500 --> 21:02.667
- This...

21:02.767 --> 21:05.167
is my legacy.

21:05.267 --> 21:06.900
- DeMamp Camp.

21:07.067 --> 21:08.900
- Nice.

21:09.067 --> 21:10.367
- Nice!

21:14.800 --> 21:15.967
- Drugs?

21:16.067 --> 21:19.067
Where are you?

21:20.467 --> 21:23.200
I know you're in there, drugs!

21:24.467 --> 21:26.233
Drugs?

21:27.567 --> 21:27.867
Drugs?
