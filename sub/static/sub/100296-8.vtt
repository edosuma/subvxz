00:02.690 --> 00:04.829
BILL: You and Teresa should consider fostering those kids.

00:04.870 --> 00:07.043
I told 'em they're
a part of our family.

00:07.090 --> 00:08.250
What if they always see me
as their father's killer

00:08.310 --> 00:09.698
instead of looking at me
as their dad?

00:09.740 --> 00:10.911
I'm running for sheriff.

00:10.960 --> 00:12.086
You want your vote
to really count,

00:12.140 --> 00:13.391
keep digging on Hollister.

00:13.440 --> 00:14.702
PAULA [over phone]:
There's a shooter.

00:14.750 --> 00:15.910
-[gunshots]
-I can hear him coming this way.

00:15.970 --> 00:16.834
You!

-[door buzzing]

BILL [over phone]:
Paula? Paula!

00:30.590 --> 00:32.194
-BILL: Morning, babe.
-Mmm.

00:36.860 --> 00:38.896
You were up again
in the middle of the night.

00:39.860 --> 00:41.077
Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

00:41.690 --> 00:42.816
BILL: Yeah, I noticed.

00:43.910 --> 00:44.808
What's going on?

00:44.870 --> 00:46.030
Talk to me.

00:46.650 --> 00:47.605
You okay?

00:47.650 --> 00:49.606
It's the whole hospital thing,

00:49.650 --> 00:51.254
my new boss, the...

00:51.310 --> 00:52.470
pressure to make budget cuts.

00:52.530 --> 00:54.088
It's just...
It's getting in my head.

00:54.610 --> 00:55.747
Your brain's full.

00:56.490 --> 00:58.219
It's normal.
You've been through a lot.

00:58.880 --> 01:01.394
All I know is,
is before I became sheriff,

01:01.450 --> 01:02.872
this house slept better.

01:05.710 --> 01:06.927
Don't do that.

01:07.890 --> 01:09.141
Do what?

01:09.190 --> 01:12.148
Try and put all of this
on your shoulders.

01:12.680 --> 01:14.159
We work through this together.

01:17.330 --> 01:18.376
That's the deal.

01:20.600 --> 01:21.726
You're right.

01:22.600 --> 01:23.555
I know.

01:27.690 --> 01:29.999
It also means we ne_ed_to know
what you're thinking.

01:31.780 --> 01:32.860
About what?

01:34.350 --> 01:35.567
You told me Jerry London
asked for your endorsement.

01:37.140 --> 01:38.129
You gonna give it to him?

01:39.010 --> 01:40.568
Or do you have your own plans?

01:42.530 --> 01:43.576
Babe?

01:45.450 --> 01:47.793
Just because I don't put
my weight behind Jerry,

01:48.710 --> 01:50.701
doesn't mean_ I have
any grand Ideas.

01:52.110 --> 01:53.327
I almost believe you.

01:53.760 --> 01:55.011
MAGGIE:
Believe what?

01:55.680 --> 01:57.159
Am I missing out on drama?

01:57.720 --> 01:58.766
You wish.

01:59.290 --> 02:00.325
You ready to go?

02:00.380 --> 02:02.109
'Cause we're behind schedule.

02:02.160 --> 02:03.889
Oh, and don't forgot
we have that meeting.

02:03.940 --> 02:05.817
Dad, are you coming to that?

02:05.860 --> 02:07.725
The first session's gonna be
you and your mom

02:07.770 --> 02:09.556
but I'm gonna be
at the next one.

02:11.210 --> 02:12.256
All right, time's up.

02:12.300 --> 02:13.813
Let's hit the trail.

02:15.430 --> 02:17.386
-I love you.
-PAULA: I love you.

02:19.870 --> 02:21.041
Mm. Te quiero.

02:33.280 --> 02:35.100
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:35.150 --> 02:36.321
What am I missing?

02:36.370 --> 02:38.531
We got a new dog.
Her name's Bella.

02:38.590 --> 02:40.285
[laughs] They found a dog.

02:40.330 --> 02:42.059
Bella is a dumb name.

02:42.110 --> 02:43.543
What?

02:43.590 --> 02:45.729
Yeah, they found her
running around on our street.

02:46.420 --> 02:49.332
You, uh, sure she didn't
have a chip or anything?

02:49.380 --> 02:51.075
Nope, no chip,
we had her checked out.

02:51.120 --> 02:52.337
No collar.

02:52.780 --> 02:55.294
Can we adopt her, please?

02:55.340 --> 02:56.739
That's a pretty big deal,
you know.

02:56.780 --> 02:58.338
It's a lot of responsibility.

02:58.390 --> 03:02.212
It means that you love her
no matter what. Forever.

03:02.260 --> 03:03.397
You sure
you're ready for that?

03:03.440 --> 03:04.600
Forever is a long time.

03:05.090 --> 03:06.170
It's not just next week.

03:07.490 --> 03:08.559
How about you, Roberto?

03:09.710 --> 03:11.223
As long as she's not a Bella.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.529
Oh, what's wrong with Bella?

03:16.450 --> 03:19.237
Sheriff Hollister,
now that Undersheriff London

03:19.280 --> 03:21.145
has announced his candidacy,

03:21.200 --> 03:23.452
we think you should begin
to coordinate with him--

03:23.500 --> 03:24.580
No.

03:27.200 --> 03:28.189
Excuse me?

03:28.990 --> 03:30.025
Hell no.

03:30.600 --> 03:32.500
Jerry London
hasn't been elected yet.

03:33.030 --> 03:34.554
I'm not coordinating
with someone

03:34.600 --> 03:36.556
who mightbecome
the next sheriff.

03:36.600 --> 03:38.158
No one else is running.

03:38.650 --> 03:40.163
It's time to face facts.

03:40.820 --> 03:43.300
London is the future
of this department.

03:43.350 --> 03:45.306
He's already presented
his policy agenda.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.170
Oh, I know. I've read it.

03:47.660 --> 03:49.389
Jerry wants to
drag this department

03:49.440 --> 03:51.351
back to the 19505,

03:51.400 --> 03:53.049
and you're gonna let him do it.

03:53.790 --> 03:57.055
If you have policy priorities
you'd care to present...

03:57.100 --> 03:59.148
We've got a budget deficit,

03:59.190 --> 04:00.498
a staffing shortage,

04:00.540 --> 04:02.758
and zero community outreach.

04:03.330 --> 04:06.015
Look, I don't have
much time left,

04:06.070 --> 04:08.413
but I'll be damned if
I'm gonna spend those days

04:08.460 --> 04:10.803
talking about
Jerry London's big plan.

04:11.770 --> 04:13.465
We're not done here, Sheriff.

04:15.290 --> 04:16.552
Oh, I think we are.

04:18.170 --> 04:20.115
When I moved to the tenth floor,
I made a commitment to myself,

04:20.170 --> 04:23.298
to build a new department
from the inside

04:23.780 --> 04:25.338
that works for the people,

04:25.390 --> 04:27.438
not the politicians.

04:27.480 --> 04:28.731
[scoffs]

04:28.790 --> 04:31.042
I always thought voter fraud
was a myth.

04:31.090 --> 04:32.478
But you people...

04:34.140 --> 04:37.098
No way someone pulled the lever
for this clown show.

04:39.970 --> 04:42.484
[theme music playing]

04:45.240 --> 04:48.277
[rock music playing
over earphones]

04:48.330 --> 04:50.673
LONDON [on TV]:
...this city, this county,

04:50.720 --> 04:52.893
we're at a crossroads.

04:52.940 --> 04:54.805
Do we lead the way
or do we get left behind?

04:56.380 --> 04:57.802
You seeing this?

04:57.860 --> 05:00.374
LONDON:
...represents 170 years
of history.

05:00.430 --> 05:02.375
-Yo, Bishop.
-[music blaring over earphones]

05:02.430 --> 05:04.034
Hey, oh! You all right?

05:05.210 --> 05:06.336
BISHOP: What's up?

05:06.390 --> 05:08.164
You seein'
London's announcement?

05:08.220 --> 05:09.346
...that I'll be a candidate

05:09.390 --> 05:10.641
for sheriff
of Los Angeles County.

05:10.700 --> 05:11.860
Oh. [scoffs]

05:12.700 --> 05:14.736
He's only been planning that
for 20 years.

05:15.830 --> 05:17.001
So, how do you feel?

05:18.620 --> 05:19.746
Ambivalent.

05:19.790 --> 05:21.781
[laughs]
No, I meant the accident.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.311
You know, how do you, uh,
how do you feel?

05:24.750 --> 05:26.274
Sorry, yeah. Uh...

05:27.500 --> 05:28.535
All right.

05:28.580 --> 05:29.842
Ifeel...

05:31.670 --> 05:33.149
good, you know.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.622
Yeah, sounds like it.

05:36.160 --> 05:37.320
So, is, uh...

05:38.510 --> 05:40.068
Bill his own chauffeur now?

05:40.550 --> 05:41.801
It's for the best.

05:41.860 --> 05:43.418
Can't sit behind a wheel
my whole life.

05:43.470 --> 05:46.166
I thought you liked being
the sheriff's security detail.

05:46.210 --> 05:47.381
I did.

05:48.340 --> 05:50.160
I do. But, uh...

05:53.000 --> 05:54.342
ever since the accident...

05:55.520 --> 05:56.737
You want more.

05:58.220 --> 05:59.300
Yeah.

06:01.090 --> 06:02.489
If that guy had been
going any faster,

06:02.530 --> 06:03.838
I wouldn't be here.

06:05.450 --> 06:07.008
And when my time does come...

06:09.630 --> 06:11.530
I just wanna know that
I was living my best life.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.188
I know what you mean.

06:15.370 --> 06:17.065
You see, here's the thing
about Bill,

06:17.760 --> 06:18.897
he will always stand by you.

06:18.940 --> 06:20.714
And I mean always.

06:22.460 --> 06:24.462
He just expects you
to make your own choices.

06:25.210 --> 06:26.279
And to live with 'em.

06:28.170 --> 06:29.205
Copy that.

06:30.910 --> 06:32.207
Truth is, we all gotta
start thinking

06:32.260 --> 06:33.909
about our next move,
you know.

06:33.950 --> 06:36.418
You, me, and Bill.

06:36.480 --> 06:37.959
I have the vision

06:38.000 --> 06:40.389
and the experience
to keep it that way.

06:40.830 --> 06:42.343
[indistinct
police radio chatter]

06:42.400 --> 06:44.868
I mean, how is London
supposed to be the future

06:44.920 --> 06:46.262
of this department?

06:47.400 --> 06:49.186
Everyone knows
he's just gonna pick up

06:49.230 --> 06:50.481
where Bradford left off.

06:50.540 --> 06:52.610
Sheriffs come and go.
The job doesn't change.

06:52.670 --> 06:54.149
You know that's not true.

06:54.540 --> 06:55.973
Look at Bill.

06:56.020 --> 06:58.011
Hey, your godfather
definitely shook things up.

06:58.060 --> 06:59.880
But there's a reason
for structure.

06:59.940 --> 07:01.191
Continuity.

07:01.240 --> 07:03.504
CADE [over radio]:

08:04.440 --> 08:06.385
You take _him.
There's no cage In my truck.

08:06.440 --> 08:07.782
All right, you wanna book him
or should we?

08:07.830 --> 08:09.957
No, let the boot
work on his paperwork skills.

08:11.090 --> 08:13.479
A burglary plus a 245 on me.

No defensive wounds

10:54.040 --> 10:55.291
You keep a tent down here?

10:55.350 --> 10:57.250
I was trying to find you
a new suit, Gao.

10:58.170 --> 10:59.341
You're free to go.

10:59.390 --> 11:00.823
Hey, I'm exactly
where I need to be.

11:00.870 --> 11:02.178
I got an ID for you.

11:06.840 --> 11:08.046
Semper Fi.

11:08.620 --> 11:09.780
Decorated Marine.

11:09.840 --> 11:11.353
Purple Heart was in this box.

11:15.410 --> 11:16.707
Probably hid
his dope in there.

11:16.760 --> 11:17.920
Hey.

11:17.980 --> 11:18.924
He may have been
battling some demons,

11:18.980 --> 11:20.538
but he deserves your respect.

11:22.110 --> 11:23.714
I've just seen this movie
too many times,

11:23.770 --> 11:25.067
and it's not a happy ending.

11:25.980 --> 11:27.504
What else you got for me?

11:27.550 --> 11:29.063
[sighs] That's it.

11:29.120 --> 11:30.246
How can we help?

11:32.080 --> 11:33.900
You deputies
call this a perimeter?

11:33.950 --> 11:35.679
Get the tape on both sides.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.696
If you wanna help assist us,
just keep the scene clean.

11:41.700 --> 11:42.826
Where are my techs?

11:53.400 --> 11:54.924
[cell phone buzzing]

11:57.670 --> 11:59.183
Hey. Morning.

11:59.630 --> 12:00.574
You busy?

12:00.630 --> 12:02.791
Just with line item nonsense.

12:03.720 --> 12:05.881
I don't know if this stuff's
even in English.

12:05.940 --> 12:07.931
Yeah, well, it turns out
I never learned how to read.

12:08.590 --> 12:10.114
At least that's what
Homicide seems to think.

12:10.160 --> 12:11.764
Detective Gao forgets

12:11.810 --> 12:13.675
that we all work
for the same sheriff.

12:13.730 --> 12:15.072
You gettin' sidelined?

12:15.120 --> 12:17.168
Yeah, I might use
stronger language than that.

12:17.210 --> 12:19.519
Is this the 927-D
I heard about?

12:20.130 --> 12:22.860
Yeah. He was a Marine.
Homeless.

12:24.430 --> 12:25.772
I found a chip on him.

12:25.830 --> 12:27.309
He and I went
to the same meeting.

12:28.390 --> 12:29.823
He was working the program.

12:31.570 --> 12:33.049
I don't have the words, man.

12:34.710 --> 12:36.314
Sometimes there aren't
any words.

12:38.230 --> 12:39.709
I'll call you later, all right?

12:39.750 --> 12:40.921
Yeah.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.625
Did you want me to hit you
with the headlines now,

12:45.670 --> 12:46.978
or did you get a chance to...

12:48.550 --> 12:49.619
You all right, sir?

12:50.330 --> 12:51.809
-Yeah, just...
-LONDON: Sheriff.

12:51.850 --> 12:53.249
IfI could run something
by you before the meeting?

12:53.290 --> 12:54.894
As we move forward
with the transition,

12:54.940 --> 12:56.282
it would help
the department greatly--

12:56.340 --> 12:58.558
You are not
the department, Jerry.

12:58.600 --> 12:59.897
It would help you.

13:00.430 --> 13:01.988
Never confuse those things.

13:02.910 --> 13:04.775
Bishop, you lead
the next meeting.

13:04.820 --> 13:06.344
-Sir?
-LONDON: Where you going?

13:08.300 --> 13:09.517
Check on a friend.

13:22.320 --> 13:24.481
GAO: Sheriff. To what
do we owe the pleasure?

13:24.540 --> 13:26.496
I like to get out
of the office sometimes.

13:26.540 --> 13:27.404
So I've heard.

13:28.190 --> 13:29.794
BILL:
We got a suspect? M.O.?

13:29.850 --> 13:31.624
Just the murder weapon.
Length of pipe.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.329
Thrown over a fence
about halfway down the block.

13:33.370 --> 13:34.803
Fast track everything.

13:34.850 --> 13:36.636
Toxicology. DNA.

13:36.680 --> 13:38.068
This man gets to
the front of the line.

13:39.340 --> 13:41.683
Sir, this is not
the only body we got in LA.

13:42.160 --> 13:44.299
Well, I'm still
the only sheriff, aren't I?

13:44.340 --> 13:45.557
So do it.

13:46.910 --> 13:48.810
So, is he taking over
this investigation?

13:48.870 --> 13:51.384
Nope. Just keeping it pointed
in the right direction.

13:52.390 --> 13:53.561
We're good, Detective.

13:59.830 --> 14:01.878
-Talk to me.
-[sighs]

14:01.920 --> 14:04.093
I thought I was done
seeing soldiers in body bags.

14:04.140 --> 14:05.357
This close to home, anyway.

14:05.400 --> 14:06.219
We'll make it right.

14:06.280 --> 14:07.440
What do we know?

14:07.490 --> 14:09.310
Well, the victim
was in recovery,

14:09.370 --> 14:11.053
but started using again.

14:11.760 --> 14:13.364
So possible drug beef, then?

14:14.070 --> 14:15.401
Wouldn't be the first.

14:16.720 --> 14:18.494
Pull all
the traffic camera footage.

14:18.550 --> 14:20.768
Could have come from within
or from the outside.

14:20.810 --> 14:23.028
Yeah. This place is
three blocks long, man.

14:23.680 --> 14:25.284
When I was on the streets,
it was bad.

14:25.340 --> 14:26.637
But this is apocalyptic.

14:26.690 --> 14:28.590
Sixty thousand
was the last count.

14:28.650 --> 14:30.163
Eleven thousand in vets alone.

14:31.040 --> 14:32.814
Today we're just solving
one murder.

14:34.430 --> 14:35.692
Right.

14:35.740 --> 14:37.696
Okay, these encampments
are like villages.

14:37.740 --> 14:39.082
Someone here knows something.

14:39.700 --> 14:41.474
Every neighborhood
has a drug dealer,

14:41.530 --> 14:43.430
this is just another
neighborhood, right?

14:44.570 --> 14:45.571
Right.

14:50.930 --> 14:53.091
[indistinct radio chatter]

14:54.280 --> 14:55.235
Everything good?

14:56.460 --> 14:57.711
Yeah, just wondering
why the sheriff's here.

15:02.980 --> 15:04.891
[indistinct chatter]

15:12.520 --> 15:13.726
JOSEPH: Hey.

15:14.430 --> 15:15.909
[grunts]

15:15.950 --> 15:17.645
[groaning]

15:19.000 --> 15:20.217
MINNICK: Hold still.

15:20.780 --> 15:21.826
Hey!

15:22.700 --> 15:23.735
You got any needles?

15:23.790 --> 15:25.564
Anything that's
gonna poke me?

15:25.620 --> 15:26.871
[sighs]

15:28.010 --> 15:30.399
-This is a bad look.
-Oh.

15:34.190 --> 15:36.090
Oh, and now it got even worse.

15:36.150 --> 15:38.971
I'm gonna guess
this is not your Purple Heart.

15:40.200 --> 15:41.235
Come on.

15:46.070 --> 15:47.628
You sold drugs to Dennis.

15:49.030 --> 15:50.418
But you went inside his tent,

15:50.470 --> 15:52.244
figured he kept a clean setup,

15:52.820 --> 15:54.071
so there's gotta be cash.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.987
Dennis sleeps, and you
beat him like a coward.

15:59.210 --> 16:00.950
I took what was owed.
Didn't touch him.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.080
Before or after?

16:03.830 --> 16:05.047
I don't know.

16:05.090 --> 16:06.785
-He was sleepin'.
-Sleepin'?

16:07.740 --> 16:09.002
His face was smashed in.

16:09.050 --> 16:10.176
And you thought
he was sleeping?

16:10.230 --> 16:12.095
-No!
-So you did hit him?

16:12.140 --> 16:14.267
We're running DNA
taken from that murder weapon,

16:14.320 --> 16:16.538
so I say it doesn't look good
for you right about now.

16:18.710 --> 16:20.575
What was I supposed to do?
Call someone?

16:21.630 --> 16:24.451
Few weeks back,
a woman was beaten to death.

16:24.500 --> 16:26.104
Tent just next to mine.

16:26.630 --> 16:28.234
We called the cops,
no one came out.

16:28.290 --> 16:29.769
Left us like animals.

16:29.810 --> 16:31.289
Like roadkill.

16:31.860 --> 16:33.157
Dennis was a good dude.

16:34.120 --> 16:36.076
He tried to protect
the neighborhood best he could.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.200
From who?

16:37.900 --> 16:39.117
From you.

16:47.390 --> 16:48.516
GAO: Hey, Ward.

16:49.260 --> 16:50.739
Were you interviewing
my suspect?

16:51.440 --> 16:52.566
Someone had to.

16:53.700 --> 16:55.258
Well, Ijust hung up
with the crime lab.

16:55.310 --> 16:57.096
Transfer DNA
from the murder weapon

16:57.140 --> 16:59.222
and the victim's face
IS being processed.

16:59.270 --> 17:00.828
It'll be back in 24 hours.

17:01.710 --> 17:03.883
Smart money says
that guy is our match.

17:03.930 --> 17:05.318
Then I'll talk to him.

17:05.370 --> 17:06.849
Get my confession.

17:06.890 --> 17:08.664
Yeah, there may be other murders
connected to this one.

17:10.200 --> 17:12.498
Is that what he told you?
Another murder?

17:12.550 --> 17:14.245
He was just throwing it
at the wall,
hoping it sticks.

17:14.290 --> 17:16.246
'Cause you got other,
more important things
to worry about

17:16.290 --> 17:17.336
than another body, right?

17:18.640 --> 17:20.858
Gentlemen, you wanna dance,
take it outside.

17:21.340 --> 17:22.773
I don't need to, Sheriff.

17:22.820 --> 17:24.299
The facts are on my side.

17:24.340 --> 17:26.945
He's a druggie and a dealer
with violent priors.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.468
He's our guy, and the blood
will seal the deal.

17:30.310 --> 17:32.517
Just because this case
tugs your heart strings

17:32.570 --> 17:34.219
_ doesn't mean
It's a damn conspIracy.

17:34.270 --> 17:36.170
You don't know me and you
don't know Dennis Longford.

17:36.220 --> 17:38.176
-You only think you do.
-Come on, Cade.

17:42.490 --> 17:45.186
Look, I know this one hits
close to home.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.095
But let's keep things
in perspective.

17:47.150 --> 17:49.402
[sighs] This isn't just
close to home, Bill.

17:50.240 --> 17:51.753
That could have been me.

17:51.800 --> 17:53.449
You know, I had nights
on the street

17:53.500 --> 17:54.751
where I wished it was me.

17:55.590 --> 17:57.455
-You understand?
-I do, brother.

17:57.900 --> 17:59.117
They're just dumping this case.

17:59.160 --> 18:00.934
Hoping the lab proves 'em right.

18:02.250 --> 18:04.024
So you think
they're missing something?

18:04.950 --> 18:06.338
I think we all are.

18:07.730 --> 18:10.346
Well, go find out who
Dennis Longford really was.

18:11.220 --> 18:12.903
That'll help us
find his killer.

18:21.270 --> 18:23.135
RYAN:
Okay, so before we wrap up,

18:23.180 --> 18:25.091
does anyone have
a burning desire?

18:29.630 --> 18:30.699
I do.

18:31.930 --> 18:34.239
My name is Cade,
and I'm an alcoholic.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.759
ALL: Hi, Cade.

18:35.810 --> 18:37.493
Um, I'm here...

18:37.550 --> 18:39.677
Well, I'm here because
I haven't been to a meeting

18:39.720 --> 18:41.062
in a long time.

18:41.590 --> 18:42.636
Welcome.

18:43.070 --> 18:44.241
Thank you.

18:44.900 --> 18:46.948
Been sort of managing it
on my own.

18:48.600 --> 18:50.329
And I know...
You know, sometimes we forget

18:50.390 --> 18:51.948
how fragile it all is.

18:55.220 --> 18:57.211
I've built a pretty good life
for myself, you know.

18:57.260 --> 18:59.308
I have a beautiful wife
who loves me and...

19:00.960 --> 19:02.211
and now a family.

19:04.490 --> 19:07.482
That just reminds me
of how much more
I have to lose now.

19:10.750 --> 19:13.014
I use my job
as a way to escape,

19:14.100 --> 19:15.795
in order to manage my addiction.

19:16.890 --> 19:20.064
[sighs] You know, I feel safe
in burying myself in work.

19:21.240 --> 19:23.800
But now, it's just reminding me
of where I came from and...

19:25.250 --> 19:27.810
how far I had to climb
to escape my demons.

19:31.250 --> 19:32.296
[sighs]

19:34.910 --> 19:37.549
You know, I-I lost my sister
last time and...

19:41.350 --> 19:44.342
I say lost because I don't know
if she's dead or alive.

19:46.660 --> 19:48.821
We were both on the streets,
and, you know...

19:50.400 --> 19:51.788
I made it. She didn't.

19:58.980 --> 20:00.311
I've tried to find her but...

20:02.110 --> 20:03.190
[exhales]

20:10.600 --> 20:12.249
Truth is, I don't know
if I want to anymore

20:12.290 --> 20:14.246
and risk losing my family
all over again.

20:14.300 --> 20:15.335
[sniffles]

20:23.300 --> 20:25.860
But I'm gonna make it
through today because I have to.

20:28.830 --> 20:30.218
Because we only have today.

20:36.670 --> 20:38.183
One day at a time, right?

20:40.500 --> 20:41.660
[mouths] Yep.

20:42.670 --> 20:44.103
Thank you for letting me share.

20:53.860 --> 20:55.339
Hey, hold up.

20:55.900 --> 20:57.288
Um...

20:57.340 --> 20:59.683
I'm Cade. Detective. LASD.

20:59.730 --> 21:01.778
I understand you're
Dennis Longford's sponsor.

21:02.340 --> 21:03.864
Yeah, that's right.

21:05.350 --> 21:06.772
What happened?

21:07.570 --> 21:09.379
He moved on to
something better, I hope.

21:10.440 --> 21:12.089
But I need to know
about his life.

21:14.270 --> 21:17.307
Dennis... was kind.

21:17.360 --> 21:18.657
Thoughtful.

21:19.750 --> 21:21.798
Had trouble sharing,
but, hell, who doesn't?

21:22.490 --> 21:24.310
He kept himself
pretty busy though.

21:24.370 --> 21:25.883
Counseling other vets.

21:25.930 --> 21:27.659
Trying to help people
get off the streets,

21:27.720 --> 21:28.755
and into the program.

21:29.330 --> 21:31.321
He had really strong feelings

21:31.370 --> 21:33.543
about how the city
turns its back on people.

21:33.590 --> 21:36.115
He had this deep need
to protect everyone.

21:36.160 --> 21:37.764
Even if he just met you.

21:38.200 --> 21:39.986
I went to check on him
a couple of weeks back.

21:40.030 --> 21:41.679
Landlord said he was gone.

21:42.730 --> 21:43.901
Does he have family?

21:45.650 --> 21:46.730
Just this one.

21:53.440 --> 21:54.828
Sheriff Hollister.

21:54.870 --> 21:56.428
BILL: Go bother London.

21:56.480 --> 21:58.038
We deserved that today.

21:58.570 --> 21:59.878
It was out of order.

22:00.660 --> 22:02.355
I saw a media report
this morning,

22:02.400 --> 22:04.402
death at a homeless encampment.

22:05.060 --> 22:06.357
Murder, actually.

22:06.410 --> 22:08.310
I was just down there.

22:08.800 --> 22:10.665
County's got a real problem.

22:10.720 --> 22:13.450
I wouldn't wanna step on
anyone's plans, though.

22:14.020 --> 22:15.806
I agree. It's an epidemic.

22:15.850 --> 22:18.102
At the very least,
we need to move
them into shelters.

22:18.160 --> 22:19.377
Off the streets.

22:19.420 --> 22:21.547
Any plan
has to start with that.

22:22.380 --> 22:24.598
This is a law enforcement
InstItutIon.

22:25.300 --> 22:27.074
And they're not
breaking any laws.

22:27.730 --> 22:30.073
My job is to find out
who killed a Marine.

22:30.130 --> 22:31.256
Penod.

22:31.300 --> 22:32.779
I'm not moving anyone.

22:34.300 --> 22:35.904
Listen--
I'm putting together

22:35.960 --> 22:37.860
a set of sweeping
policy proposals

22:37.920 --> 22:39.171
that will catch people

22:39.220 --> 22:40.778
before they fall
into homelessness.

22:40.830 --> 22:42.650
But for the current population,

22:42.700 --> 22:44.964
all we have are
drastIc measures.

22:45.010 --> 22:46.090
Hmm.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.402
And you think I'm
a drastic measures kinda guy?

22:51.100 --> 22:52.408
Am I wrong?

22:53.060 --> 22:54.106
[Cade clears throat]

23:03.460 --> 23:04.677
BILL:
So what do you got?

23:06.160 --> 23:07.240
Longford hadn't been on
the streets but a couple weeks.

23:07.290 --> 23:08.769
And I find it hard
to imagine that

23:08.820 --> 23:10.299
he was in that deep
with his dealer

23:10.340 --> 23:11.819
for the guy
to risk killing him.

23:11.860 --> 23:13.031
Go on.

23:13.080 --> 23:14.775
So the dealer tells me

23:14.820 --> 23:16.868
that Longford was protecting
the neighborhood.

23:16.910 --> 23:18.161
From what?

23:18.220 --> 23:19.699
Everybody.

23:19.740 --> 23:21.913
-[knock on door]
-Yeah.

23:22.530 --> 23:25.306
I pulled video from the cameras
in the area of the encampment.

23:25.360 --> 23:27.521
_ There's someone
movmg In and out of the area

23:27.580 --> 23:29.093
around the time of
Dennis Longford's death.

23:31.800 --> 23:33.574
Is he tossing
the murder weapon there?

23:33.620 --> 23:35.269
Could be.

23:37.500 --> 23:38.455
CADE:
Wearing all black.

23:38.500 --> 23:39.933
Looks like he came to do a job.

23:40.500 --> 23:42.548
Or he's just
wearing his uniform.

23:43.680 --> 23:44.806
Check it out.

23:45.850 --> 23:47.283
See if there's
any security guards

23:47.330 --> 23:49.946
posted up outside businesses
near the encampment.

23:49.990 --> 23:51.423
CADE: Copy that.

24:01.130 --> 24:02.563
Maggie.

24:04.830 --> 24:06.479
How do you feel
about me being here?

24:08.010 --> 24:08.999
It's okay.

24:10.270 --> 24:11.919
I know my mom
is worried about everything

24:11.970 --> 24:13.392
that happened
a few weeks ago.

24:15.010 --> 24:17.444
And what exactly happened?

24:18.760 --> 24:21.718
I was held hostage
at the County Jail.

24:22.540 --> 24:23.973
I volunteer in
the medIcal wmg.

24:26.020 --> 24:27.100
MAGGIE: Mom.

24:27.980 --> 24:29.982
They picked you for a reason.

24:31.640 --> 24:33.540
Why do you feel
your mother was targeted?

24:34.860 --> 24:37.420
Because my dad's the sheriff
of Los Angeles County.

24:38.430 --> 24:40.295
And if anybody
wants to get to him,

24:40.340 --> 24:42.774
they know that the best way
to do that is by getting...

24:43.520 --> 24:44.509
to us.

24:44.570 --> 24:45.514
I told you nothing like that

24:45.570 --> 24:47.049
is ever gonna happen again.

24:48.050 --> 24:49.472
You can't promise that.

24:50.530 --> 24:52.521
You don't even know half
of what I'm going through.

24:52.570 --> 24:55.130
At school, kids either
pretend they like me,

24:55.180 --> 24:56.966
thinking I can hook them up

24:57.010 --> 24:58.090
or they ice me out.

24:59.670 --> 25:01.319
I can't go anywhere without
someone breathing down my neck.

25:02.190 --> 25:03.669
Ay, mi hija.

25:03.710 --> 25:05.530
It's like the day
Dad became sheriff,

25:05.590 --> 25:07.751
our entire world
was flipped upside down.

25:08.280 --> 25:10.236
I know exactly
how you feel, sweetie.

25:10.630 --> 25:12.803
You know, I used
to worry about him

25:12.850 --> 25:15.728
walking through the door
every night.

25:16.470 --> 25:17.983
And now I just worry about

25:18.030 --> 25:20.078
what's gonna come through
the door with him.

25:29.700 --> 25:31.349
This neighborhood's
turning fast.

25:32.130 --> 25:33.734
Yeah, hopefully for the better.

25:35.010 --> 25:36.614
Yeah, I'm not
so sure about that.

25:38.580 --> 25:40.571
[construction noise]

25:45.020 --> 25:46.533
Hey, Ward.

25:46.580 --> 25:47.717
I need you to get down here.

25:47.760 --> 25:48.886
Got a possible suspect.

25:48.930 --> 25:50.659
Security guard.
Matches the video.

25:50.720 --> 25:53.154
CADE [over phone]:
All right, sit on him.
I'm coming.

25:56.590 --> 25:58.114
Hey, there.
You have a moment?

25:58.900 --> 26:00.720
Can I help you, officers?

26:00.770 --> 26:03.238
Deputies.
And we're hoping you can.

26:03.990 --> 26:05.298
You have a warrant?

26:05.780 --> 26:07.509
Easy, slim.
You watch too much TV.

26:07.560 --> 26:09.869
No, we're here because of
all the private security

26:09.910 --> 26:11.605
and-and new properties
down here.

26:11.650 --> 26:12.901
The County has us
making our rounds

26:12.960 --> 26:14.257
and checking on registration.

26:14.920 --> 26:17.172
We need to take a look
at your LIve Scan credentIals.

26:17.220 --> 26:18.915
Yeah, sorry about
the hassle.

26:18.960 --> 26:20.655
No problem. Right over here.

26:30.540 --> 26:33.839
You must have a lot of problems
with the homeless around here.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.147
Oh, you got no idea, ma'am.

26:36.760 --> 26:37.840
It's a war, you know.

26:37.900 --> 26:39.970
Yeah, and we're
all part of it.

26:43.550 --> 26:46.075
Yeah.
Looks good.

26:47.300 --> 26:48.597
It's not easy, you know.

26:51.470 --> 26:53.381
It's like The Walking Dead
out there.

26:53.430 --> 26:54.647
-MINNICK: Hmm.
-[Cade chuckles]

26:55.480 --> 26:56.515
Thank you.

27:13.190 --> 27:14.976
Hey, we got a suspect we like.

27:15.020 --> 27:16.578
Any evidence to go on?

27:17.020 --> 27:18.362
That's it, bag it.

27:18.410 --> 27:20.492
Yeah, we recovered
a DNA sample.

27:20.550 --> 27:23.064
Have Minnick and Joseph
run it down to crime lab.

27:23.110 --> 27:24.509
I'll put a rush on it.

27:24.550 --> 27:25.630
CADE [over phone]:
Copy that.

27:30.250 --> 27:32.036
So how'd it go today,
the counseling?

27:32.820 --> 27:34.071
In many ways...

27:35.910 --> 27:37.218
we weren't prepared.

27:37.690 --> 27:39.032
I mean, this is
usually a process.

27:39.090 --> 27:41.217
You... You talk to your family,

27:41.830 --> 27:44.082
and then you make the choice
to run together.

27:44.830 --> 27:46.650
And then everyone's
on board.

27:46.700 --> 27:48.656
And prepared
for the consequences.

27:50.270 --> 27:51.316
Exactly.

27:55.840 --> 27:58.104
-So...
-What can I say?

27:59.190 --> 28:01.010
I wish it would
have been different.

28:01.070 --> 28:03.413
But I can't go back
and change the past.

28:04.370 --> 28:05.541
And also, I...

28:06.550 --> 28:09.110
Feels like I'm starting
to make some progress.

28:09.160 --> 28:10.980
I mean, you see it.
Don't you?

28:12.030 --> 28:13.076
Mm-hmm.

28:15.430 --> 28:17.159
So does this mean
you're gonna run?

28:19.520 --> 28:20.600
I don't know.

28:21.430 --> 28:23.034
It means what it means.

28:24.870 --> 28:26.735
It's definitely
crossed my mind though.

28:28.350 --> 28:29.874
Bill Hollister
doesn't take a long time

28:29.920 --> 28:31.000
to think about anything.

28:32.530 --> 28:33.963
Why is this different?

28:34.010 --> 28:35.739
{Cause it's not
just about me.

28:36.880 --> 28:39.269
It's about how this job
has affected our family.

28:40.100 --> 28:41.408
How's Maggie holding up?

28:43.500 --> 28:44.751
Ask her yourself.

28:47.980 --> 28:49.322
Come sit down.

28:53.900 --> 28:55.208
How are you feeling?

28:59.080 --> 29:01.071
This job has asked
a lot of me.

29:01.130 --> 29:02.859
And your mom. And you.

29:02.910 --> 29:05.128
More than I ever thought
it would.

29:06.170 --> 29:07.512
And I'm sorry for that.

29:09.790 --> 29:11.303
But the truth is,

29:11.350 --> 29:13.818
if I didn't think
you guys could handle it,

29:13.880 --> 29:15.745
I would have said no
right on the spot.

29:17.270 --> 29:18.828
And you...

29:19.360 --> 29:20.964
You've been through
more at your age

29:21.020 --> 29:22.794
than most ever should.

29:22.840 --> 29:24.182
And not wavered.

29:28.240 --> 29:30.936
You impress the hell out of me,
Maggie Hollister.

29:39.770 --> 29:40.759
Thanks, Dad.

29:44.040 --> 29:45.814
You've done
a pretty good job, too.

29:47.870 --> 29:48.996
I have?

29:49.740 --> 29:51.128
Mm-hmm.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.308
[chuckles]

29:56.790 --> 29:58.041
Hey.

29:58.100 --> 29:59.613
Hey, boss.
Look at this.

29:59.660 --> 30:01.389
I've been looking
into Ahern Development,

30:01.450 --> 30:03.259
they've blown up
in the last four years

30:03.320 --> 30:04.480
in a good way.

30:04.540 --> 30:06.269
For them
and the real estate market.

30:07.190 --> 30:08.703
A hot yoga studio.

30:08.760 --> 30:10.409
-Of course.
-Yeah.

30:10.460 --> 30:12.360
They got two buildings nearby
in their final phases

30:12.410 --> 30:13.889
and then the one
that we visited.

30:14.550 --> 30:15.847
Right next to the encampment.

30:15.900 --> 30:16.798
BISHOP: Sir.

30:17.380 --> 30:18.506
Got the lab report.

30:19.810 --> 30:21.812
DNA we pulled from
the security guard is a match.

30:21.860 --> 30:24.078
-You want us to go rip him?
-No.

30:24.120 --> 30:25.678
-I got it.
-Hey.

30:25.730 --> 30:27.288
Take a breath. Focus.

30:27.340 --> 30:29.069
-Okay?
-[Cade sighs]

30:30.350 --> 30:31.476
Take the guard into custody.

30:31.520 --> 30:32.646
Meet us at the station.

30:33.260 --> 30:34.340
Let's roll.

30:39.140 --> 30:40.528
[door buzzes]

30:47.450 --> 30:48.792
I checked your record.

30:50.410 --> 30:52.366
So have you ever been to court?

30:53.410 --> 30:55.719
Couple times.
Pled out.

30:56.150 --> 30:57.321
CADE:
Yeah, I saw that.

30:58.200 --> 30:59.326
Assault.

31:00.460 --> 31:01.768
But these charges
won't go away.

31:01.810 --> 31:03.061
There's no plea here.

31:06.560 --> 31:08.425
Unless, maybe, you tell me
why you did it.

31:09.510 --> 31:11.421
I told you.
I didn't do anything.

31:11.470 --> 31:12.903
CADE: But you did.

31:12.950 --> 31:14.770
You beat this man to death.

31:14.820 --> 31:17.163
And that is what the jury's
gonna hear in court.

31:20.130 --> 31:22.473
His name is Dennis Longford.

31:23.490 --> 31:24.912
A decorated Marine veteran

31:24.970 --> 31:28.007
_ who survived two to_urs
In Iraq, one In AfghanIstan.

31:28.060 --> 31:31.575
And was murdered on the streets
of AmerIca, by a rent-a-cop.

31:31.620 --> 31:33.099
I don't believe you.

31:33.150 --> 31:34.447
CADE: Which part?

31:34.500 --> 31:37.105
That isn't me.

31:37.150 --> 31:40.142
Yeah, well, your DNA is telling us a different story.

31:40.200 --> 31:42.543
_ Life in a concrete box
Is what's comIng for you.

31:42.590 --> 31:45.115
-No.
-Did you see
his face before?

31:46.550 --> 31:47.858
How about now?

31:49.990 --> 31:51.207
Look at him!

32:00.390 --> 32:02.608
Look at it!
Look at what you did!

32:04.050 --> 32:07.008
You killed a homeless veteran.

32:07.570 --> 32:08.912
I need to know why!

32:13.190 --> 32:14.532
I needed the money.

32:15.710 --> 32:17.530
I was gonna lose everything.

32:20.850 --> 32:22.329
I didn't know
he was somebody.

32:25.500 --> 32:27.149
Everyone is somebody.

32:27.720 --> 32:29.119
Even you.

32:34.380 --> 32:35.859
Now tell me who paid you.

32:37.170 --> 32:38.512
GUARD [over monitor]:
I can't.

32:38.560 --> 32:40.334
Please, I can't tell you that.

32:42.220 --> 32:44.381
It's okay,
tell me who paid you.

32:47.050 --> 32:49.393
I dedicate this building
to the notion

32:49.440 --> 32:52.398
that progress
is not a dirty word.

32:55.190 --> 32:58.318
This means a better city
for our children.

32:58.750 --> 32:59.796
Neal Ahern.

33:01.370 --> 33:02.405
Sheriff.

33:03.500 --> 33:05.149
Welcome to our ribbon cutting.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.361
So what brings
you downtown?

33:07.420 --> 33:09.456
You saw a threat
to your Investment.

33:09.500 --> 33:10.717
Excuse me?

33:11.680 --> 33:14.501
Who's gonna pay
triple market value for a condo

33:14.550 --> 33:16.632
if you have to wade through
human misery

33:16.690 --> 33:18.078
to get to your front door?

33:18.120 --> 33:19.553
AHERN: Is this
some sort of joke?

33:20.210 --> 33:21.598
I don't have to listen to this.

33:21.650 --> 33:23.379
I built this city.

33:24.040 --> 33:25.166
You wouldn't understand that.

33:28.310 --> 33:30.346
Step aside.
I'll only say it once.

33:34.090 --> 33:35.785
You a quick draw, ese?

33:39.100 --> 33:40.579
I didn't think so.

33:43.580 --> 33:45.059
Mr. Ahern here

33:45.110 --> 33:46.668
paid an underling

33:46.720 --> 33:49.109
to murder a homeless man
In cold blood.

33:50.110 --> 33:53.489
Thinking it would force us
to clear the encampments,

33:53.550 --> 33:56.110
so people like him
can walk unmolested

33:56.160 --> 33:58.674
to their $12 juice bars
every morning.

33:59.160 --> 34:01.856
The man you had murdered
was a decorated Marine.

34:01.900 --> 34:03.333
A Purple Heart.

34:03.860 --> 34:05.259
AH ERN:
This is ridiculous.

34:05.300 --> 34:07.814
You've gone completely rogue,
Sheriff Hollister.

34:07.870 --> 34:09.121
Well, I'm not the dumbass

34:09.170 --> 34:11.513
who wired money directly
to the murderer.

34:11.570 --> 34:13.299
Even called him twice.

34:13.870 --> 34:15.599
Let this be a reminder,

34:15.660 --> 34:17.821
that being rich and being smart

34:18.360 --> 34:20.521
are pretty damn far
from the same thing.

34:21.620 --> 34:23.053
Turn around.

34:23.100 --> 34:24.579
[reporters clamoring]

[microphone feedback]

34:37.160 --> 34:39.799
Don't have too many rides
left in this thing, I guess.

34:43.770 --> 34:44.759
What?

34:44.820 --> 34:46.162
Why don't you just ask me?

34:46.210 --> 34:47.768
Everyone else has.

34:47.820 --> 34:49.594
Okay. You gonna run?

34:49.650 --> 34:50.810
'Cause I think you should.

34:51.870 --> 34:53.121
It's not that simple.

34:53.740 --> 34:55.389
-CADE: Well, maybe it is.
-[elevator bell dings]

34:58.050 --> 34:59.824
-I'll see you later.
-BILL: Yeah.

35:00.880 --> 35:02.222
BISHOP: Sheriff.

35:02.270 --> 35:04.352
Sir, I found a number
of suspicious deaths

35:04.400 --> 35:05.651
likely connected to Ahern.

35:05.710 --> 35:07.223
Where did you find these?

35:07.270 --> 35:09.352
Well, I figured a guy like him,
it's not his first rodeo.

35:09.410 --> 35:10.968
So I checked with Homicide

35:11.020 --> 35:12.794
for any unsolved murders
in proximity

35:12.840 --> 35:14.319
to Ahern Developments.

35:14.370 --> 35:16.019
These were the ones
with the matching M.O.

35:17.720 --> 35:19.585
-This is good work, Bishop.
-Thank you.

35:19.630 --> 35:21.029
Get these to Cade ASAP.

35:21.070 --> 35:22.287
Sir.

35:24.640 --> 35:26.289
-Something else?
-Yes, sir.

35:27.600 --> 35:29.295
About today, I-I can't

35:29.340 --> 35:31.649
stand in for the sheriff
of Los Angeles County.

35:31.690 --> 35:33.908
Someone questioning
your authority?

35:33.950 --> 35:36.123
Of course they are.
I have none.

35:36.170 --> 35:38.730
And more to the point,
I've lost my purpose here.

35:38.780 --> 35:40.338
Especially since the accident.

35:41.570 --> 35:42.787
You're right.

35:42.830 --> 35:44.525
So what are you gonna
do about it?

35:46.840 --> 35:48.000
Sir?

35:49.530 --> 35:51.486
You got way too much talent
to be sittin' behind a wheel.

35:51.540 --> 35:54.577
And you're too valuable to be
taking notes for me in meetings.

35:55.370 --> 35:56.883
And I've been patient enough.

35:56.930 --> 35:59.364
So it's time for you
to make a choice, Bishop.

36:01.370 --> 36:02.541
You knew I could do more.

36:03.240 --> 36:05.196
I read your file
the first day we met.

36:06.640 --> 36:09.803
I wondered how
a natIonal securIty analyst
from DC

36:09.860 --> 36:12.897
might end up driving
the sheriff of LA County.

36:14.950 --> 36:16.679
So I called your supervisor.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.297
I know what went down.

36:21.700 --> 36:23.179
It doesn't matter.

36:23.740 --> 36:26.174
Everyone deserves a chance
to rewrite their story.

36:28.440 --> 36:29.828
You just need to ask yourself,

36:29.880 --> 36:32.098
"How can I best serve
those around me?"

36:35.540 --> 36:36.791
I know what I want.

36:36.840 --> 36:38.489
Well, tell me now.

36:38.540 --> 36:40.314
'Cause I won't ask again.

36:41.190 --> 36:42.498
Intelligence Analyst.

36:42.540 --> 36:43.882
For Majors.

36:44.810 --> 36:48.234
_ _There are no sworn _
InteIIIgence analysts In Majors.

36:49.510 --> 36:50.807
That's right, sir.

36:50.860 --> 36:52.509
Just like Majors wasn't
in the Hall of Justice

36:52.550 --> 36:53.767
before you were sheriff.

36:54.690 --> 36:55.850
[laughs]

36:58.730 --> 37:00.038
Get me a proposal.

37:00.080 --> 37:01.684
Have it on my desk Monday.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.160
Copy that.

37:08.570 --> 37:09.696
Shenﬁ?

37:10.570 --> 37:12.822
What you just said, about...

37:13.530 --> 37:16.181
asking yourself how you can
best serve those around you?

37:18.190 --> 37:20.750
I think maybe you should
take your own advice.

37:28.020 --> 37:29.282
Wild day, huh?

37:29.330 --> 37:30.888
[chuckles]

37:30.940 --> 37:32.419
Hey, what are you
on tonight?

37:32.460 --> 37:35.372
I'm, uh, thinking about
getting a drink at the bar,

37:35.420 --> 37:36.728
if you wanna...

37:36.770 --> 37:37.987
You wanna join me?

37:38.030 --> 37:39.019
[scoffs]

37:39.990 --> 37:41.298
Did you just flirt with me?

37:41.340 --> 37:42.557
No.

37:43.260 --> 37:44.648
No, I did not flirt with you.

37:44.690 --> 37:46.214
We are friends,
why would I flirt with you?

37:46.260 --> 37:48.125
-Okay.
-And for the record,

37:48.170 --> 37:50.126
if I was trying
to flirt with you,

37:50.740 --> 37:51.786
you would know.

37:51.830 --> 37:54.003
[laughs]
Oh, really?

37:54.050 --> 37:55.267
You would, yes.

37:55.310 --> 37:57.096
'Cause I would hit you
with a no-look.

37:57.140 --> 37:58.300
Looks like this, right?

37:59.140 --> 38:00.266
Walking down.

38:00.970 --> 38:03.052
I don't see you
but you know I see you.

38:04.060 --> 38:05.448
Stop, dimples.

38:07.320 --> 38:08.924
Hmm. You know what I see?

38:08.980 --> 38:11.062
-JOSEPH: What?
-Why you still single.

38:12.630 --> 38:14.325
-Really?
-Good night, boot.

38:14.370 --> 38:15.803
-I wasn't flirting.
-MINNICK: Okay.

38:15.850 --> 38:17.499
-You would know.
-MINNICK: Okay.

38:20.120 --> 38:22.111
[distant siren wailing]

39:00.900 --> 39:02.595
KING: You really enjoy
playing the part,

39:02.640 --> 39:03.982
don't you, Sheriff?

39:06.300 --> 39:08.814
So I guess you're not gonna help
with this tent city problem.

39:10.130 --> 39:13.645
You ever take a close look
at the mural behind me?

39:15.260 --> 39:16.568
Not particularly.

39:17.610 --> 39:20.522
Spanish sent 44 people
to start this city.

39:21.050 --> 39:22.745
None of 'em
look We you or me.

39:26.230 --> 39:28.095
They were even trespassers.

39:28.140 --> 39:30.142
When our people
finally got here,

39:30.190 --> 39:32.533
wearing 2,000 miles
of trail dust,

39:32.580 --> 39:34.445
some of "em had to
eat each other

39:34.500 --> 39:35.797
in those damn mountains.

39:37.280 --> 39:39.362
I'm familiar with
the Donner Party, Sheriff.

39:40.160 --> 39:41.969
Right, I bet you are.

39:42.940 --> 39:45.636
Well, this issue,
it's all relative.

39:45.680 --> 39:48.410
I mean, hell,
cowboys are born homeless.

39:48.470 --> 39:50.461
Too many of 'em die that way.

39:52.390 --> 39:53.516
So what I'm sitting here

39:53.560 --> 39:55.903
asking myself is, uh...

39:57.040 --> 39:58.166
why?

40:00.440 --> 40:01.828
Ahern Development.

40:03.350 --> 40:05.614
You're on the board
of that company, are you not?

40:07.570 --> 40:09.174
Be very careful now, Sheriff.

40:09.920 --> 40:12.662
I suspect you're about to say
something you might regret.

40:12.710 --> 40:14.758
Remember who controls
your budget.

40:15.500 --> 40:17.058
And I suspect you might regret

40:17.110 --> 40:19.977
asking me to do your dirty work
in the first place.

40:21.280 --> 40:22.884
You don't have
much time left, Sheriff.

40:22.940 --> 40:24.362
Spend it wisely.

40:25.420 --> 40:27.809
Well, the door swings
both ways, pal.

40:37.520 --> 40:38.464
Hey, Ryan.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.080
Hey, Cade.

40:42.480 --> 40:44.345
Didn't think
I'd see you again.
Are you okay?

40:44.390 --> 40:45.698
Yeah, better.

40:45.740 --> 40:47.048
RYAN:
Hmm. Better is good.

40:47.700 --> 40:49.042
Hey, listen, I, uh,

40:49.090 --> 40:50.967
probably shouldn't be
doing this but...

40:51.010 --> 40:52.875
This belonged to Dennis.

40:53.530 --> 40:55.486
I know he doesn't
have a family but I, uh...

40:55.540 --> 40:57.440
I think you should have it.

40:58.320 --> 41:00.185
Well, I-I don't know if I can.
I mean...

41:00.930 --> 41:02.579
You're one of the only people
who understands

41:02.630 --> 41:03.790
what this meant to him.

41:05.630 --> 41:07.586
And you're right, by the way.
He was a protector.

41:09.110 --> 41:10.509
I know people depended on him.

41:11.810 --> 41:13.334
It's why he was killed.

41:13.940 --> 41:16.204
I'm just hoping all this means
something in the end.

41:24.560 --> 41:25.822
I'll tell you what.

41:25.870 --> 41:27.735
Why don't you hang around
for this meeting

41:27.780 --> 41:28.781
and I'll think about it.

41:28.830 --> 41:30.172
Come on.

42:03.860 --> 42:05.999
What are you doing in here?
Hi, sweetheart.

42:06.040 --> 42:08.031
She wanted to come see you.

42:08.090 --> 42:09.864
-Tell you something.
-Oh, yeah?

42:10.780 --> 42:11.826
She likes you.

42:12.870 --> 42:14.041
Camilla likes you, too.

42:15.570 --> 42:16.559
I'm glad.

42:17.790 --> 42:18.836
What about you?

42:20.620 --> 42:22.269
I don't think
I'm gonna kill you anymore.

42:24.620 --> 42:25.700
You sure?

42:25.760 --> 42:27.011
Yeah.

42:28.370 --> 42:29.439
I wanna stay.

42:31.540 --> 42:32.848
Come here.

42:32.890 --> 42:34.107
You're not going anywhere.
