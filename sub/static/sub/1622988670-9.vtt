WEBVTT

00:16.146 --> 00:19.367
You see what
that motherfucker did?

00:20.759 --> 00:21.934
Okay.

00:21.978 --> 00:24.154
Can you give me a copy of this?

00:24.198 --> 00:25.938
Sure.

00:25.982 --> 00:28.550
Just promise me you get that guy
off the streets.

00:28.593 --> 00:30.639
He's gonna kill somebody
someday.

00:30.682 --> 00:33.120
-We'll do our best, sir.
-Yeah.

00:37.254 --> 00:40.040
What'd he say?

00:40.083 --> 00:41.737
"Kung flu."

00:42.912 --> 00:44.435
Okay, let's get him in.

00:44.479 --> 00:46.220
Hey, I didn't do nothing, man.

00:46.263 --> 00:48.439
Fuck those Chinamen
bringing that shit here.

00:48.483 --> 00:49.875
Huh? Fuck 'em!

00:49.919 --> 00:51.399
This is bullshit!

00:52.791 --> 00:53.966
Just fuck you.

00:54.010 --> 00:55.577
-Fuck you! Huh?

00:55.620 --> 00:57.100
Hey!

00:57.144 --> 00:59.537
He looks familiar, doesn't he?

01:00.538 --> 01:02.584
Yeah, Mr. Tire Iron.

01:02.627 --> 01:04.803
-Yep.
What are you
talking about?

01:04.847 --> 01:06.979
You like beating up
70-year-old women, Clay.

01:07.023 --> 01:09.112
-You're famous around here.
-That's bullshit.

01:09.156 --> 01:11.114
-Bullshit!
-Tell the judge about it

01:11.158 --> 01:13.029
after you're processed.

01:25.085 --> 01:28.088
-Hey, what's going on?
-Working on the elevators.

01:28.131 --> 01:30.090
Are you kidding? They've
been doing that for months.

01:30.133 --> 01:32.309
Yep. Cook County.
Where you going?

01:32.353 --> 01:33.658
Bond court.

01:33.702 --> 01:35.095
Overflow is
on the seventh floor.

01:35.138 --> 01:36.618
-You're kidding?

01:36.661 --> 01:38.489
Hope you got your hiking boots.

01:39.490 --> 01:42.102
Come on.

01:45.061 --> 01:48.151
Oh, this is bullshit!

01:48.195 --> 01:50.762
You need to learn
another word, chief.

01:52.155 --> 01:54.288
You can't have me going up
all these stairs, man.

01:54.331 --> 01:56.594
-I got a bad meniscus.
-What's that?

01:56.638 --> 01:59.597
-My knee. I got a bad knee.
-Didn't look all that bad

01:59.641 --> 02:02.339
when you were stomping the shit
out of that lady.

02:03.340 --> 02:05.734
<i>Please, can everyone
please stay in your line?</i>

02:05.777 --> 02:07.736
<i>-Next case, please.</i>

02:07.779 --> 02:09.738
My God, this is insane.

02:09.781 --> 02:11.740
It smells like shit in here.

02:11.783 --> 02:14.177
Fuck.
-Whoa, whoa. What?

02:14.221 --> 02:16.701
Judge just let my collar out
on his own recognizance.

02:16.745 --> 02:19.356
-Why?
-Hey, sheriff's too busy.

02:19.400 --> 02:20.923
Overcrowding.

02:20.966 --> 02:23.404
I just climbed up seven flights
for nothing.

02:23.447 --> 02:25.754
I can't keep doing this shit.

02:25.797 --> 02:27.756
See? What's the point?

02:27.799 --> 02:29.845
Just let me go, man.

02:31.194 --> 02:32.804
What, what are you thinking?

02:32.848 --> 02:34.284
I'm thinking
there might be another way.

02:38.375 --> 02:40.203
Fuck it.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.689
Hey, where are we going?

02:47.732 --> 02:49.604
These cuffs
are cutting into me, man.

02:50.605 --> 02:53.651
-Almost there.
-Where, asshole? Where? Where?

03:05.489 --> 03:07.535
What the hell is this,
a copy shop?

03:07.578 --> 03:09.145
A court.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.973
What the fuck?
This isn't a court.

03:17.458 --> 03:19.547
-What's going on?
-We're on TV now.

03:19.590 --> 03:22.071
It's what happens.
I got a standing ovation.

03:22.114 --> 03:23.681
Okay, quiet down.

03:23.725 --> 03:25.466
Quiet down, or I'm
gonna have to clear the court.

03:25.509 --> 03:27.555
-Come on, let's go, let's go.

03:27.598 --> 03:31.167
Ah, the boys in blue.
What do you have for me?

03:31.211 --> 03:32.255
Hate crime, Your Honor.

03:32.299 --> 03:33.517
What did he do?

03:33.561 --> 03:35.215
Punched a 72-year old woman

03:35.258 --> 03:37.086
in the head, stomped on her,
sent her to the hospital.

03:37.129 --> 03:38.392
Bring him up here.

03:38.435 --> 03:40.481
Make room, Mr. Zebra.
Fly away, Eagle.

03:42.309 --> 03:44.267
Your Honor,
can we talk for a second?

03:44.311 --> 03:46.138
-What do you need?
-To talk.

03:49.098 --> 03:51.187
-What's wrong?
-Is that real?

03:51.231 --> 03:53.102
-I don't understand. The case?
-Yeah.

03:53.145 --> 03:54.756
Did Del send them in
to add drama?

03:54.799 --> 03:56.758
-What? No.
-Well, that's a serious case.

03:56.801 --> 03:58.368
That's for a real court, not us.

03:58.412 --> 04:00.501
-We're a real court.
-Not for issues like that.

04:00.544 --> 04:02.894
-You don't know that.
-This is crossing a line.

04:02.938 --> 04:05.114
Okay, wait.
Let's listen to what they have.

04:05.157 --> 04:06.942
Ask any questions you want.

04:06.985 --> 04:08.596
If you think
I'm crossing the line

04:08.639 --> 04:10.467
after my ruling,
send me a signal.

04:10.511 --> 04:11.512
What signal?

04:11.555 --> 04:12.991
How about this?

04:13.035 --> 04:14.645
-Subtle.
-How about this?

04:15.864 --> 04:17.387
Oh, my God. Stop.

04:17.431 --> 04:19.476
Okay, let's go.

04:22.131 --> 04:25.177
Where'd you get this?
-From the bodega
surveillance camera

04:25.221 --> 04:26.440
on the corner.

04:37.015 --> 04:38.408
Hey, that wasn't me.

04:38.452 --> 04:40.845
Then you've got an identical
twin, my friend.

04:40.889 --> 04:42.543
Yeah, I-I do, actually, I do.

04:42.586 --> 04:44.980
Your Honor, he told us in
the patrol car why he did it.

04:45.023 --> 04:46.503
Why'd you do it, sir?

04:46.547 --> 04:48.505
I mean, it wasn't me, but...

04:48.549 --> 04:51.291
but if it was, it's 'cause...
it's 'cause these Asian assholes

04:51.334 --> 04:53.031
are making us wear
these masks, man.

04:53.075 --> 04:55.904
I lost my apartment
'cause of them.

05:00.691 --> 05:02.824
I have a question
for the officers, Your Honor.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.956
-Go ahead.
-Why didn't you take
this culprit

05:05.000 --> 05:06.306
to Leighton Criminal Court?

05:06.349 --> 05:08.308
We did.
I mean, we processed him,

05:08.351 --> 05:10.310
tried to transfer him
to sheriff's custody,

05:10.353 --> 05:12.616
but due to overcrowding,
arrestees were being released

05:12.660 --> 05:15.184
-on their own recognizance.
-And Clay's attacked before.

05:15.227 --> 05:17.752
In fact, this hate crime
only happened because Clay

05:17.795 --> 05:19.493
was released without bail
a week ago.

05:19.536 --> 05:21.364
Yeah, he was called
Mr. Tire Iron.

05:21.408 --> 05:23.366
He beat a 75-year-old woman
at a bus stop.

05:23.410 --> 05:24.715
That's why we're here,
Your Honor.

05:24.759 --> 05:26.282
No, he's lying. They're lying.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.284
I never hurt anybody
who didn't hurt me.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.459
Okay.

05:30.895 --> 05:34.595
It is never my preference
to preempt Cook County,

05:34.638 --> 05:38.555
but it is my belief that
this man will hurt someone again

05:38.599 --> 05:40.340
if released.

05:40.383 --> 05:41.645
So...

05:41.689 --> 05:43.560
I am sentencing you, sir,

05:43.604 --> 05:45.997
to one year
in David Cord's private prison,

05:46.041 --> 05:48.260
where he will receive
psychological counseling,

05:48.304 --> 05:52.134
and this court will review again
in one month

05:52.177 --> 05:54.179
to determine his progress.

05:54.223 --> 05:56.486
-Thank you, Your Honor.
-Take him into custody, Dean.

05:56.530 --> 05:59.533
I didn't do anything!
I didn't do anything!

05:59.576 --> 06:01.752
-I had to punch her
'cause she was gonna punch me!

06:01.796 --> 06:04.886
She was gonna punch me, man!

06:04.929 --> 06:07.454
It's 10-22. Is 10-24 on air?

06:07.497 --> 06:09.107
<i>10-24. Go with 10-22.</i>

06:09.151 --> 06:13.677
10-24 should consider
alternate processing venue

06:13.721 --> 06:15.723
at Atlantic and Howard.

06:16.724 --> 06:19.683
10-22,
what is Atlantic and Howard?

06:19.727 --> 06:22.077
<i>10-24,
best you see for yourself.</i>

06:22.120 --> 06:24.122
<i>Just disposed of our 510 there.</i>

06:24.166 --> 06:26.386
<i>No stairs. No wait.</i>

06:26.429 --> 06:29.563
Uh, 10-24, advised. We're out.

06:41.052 --> 06:44.229
-So, first...
-I should warn you that I'm bad
at interviewing.

06:44.273 --> 06:46.971
Also, I took some cough syrup
this morning,

06:47.015 --> 06:49.626
so I'm a bit more intuitive
than usual.

06:52.803 --> 06:56.241
You haven't worked in a law firm
in ten years, Ms. Durado.

06:56.285 --> 06:57.852
Why come back now?

06:57.895 --> 06:59.810
-It's an interesting time.
-Why is that?

06:59.854 --> 07:02.509
After a fire, all that's left
are the foundations.

07:02.552 --> 07:04.424
It's a good time to rebuild.

07:04.467 --> 07:06.208
And how would you rebuild?

07:06.251 --> 07:09.429
Recently, I've become obsessed
with space law.

07:10.473 --> 07:11.953
-Sorry?
-Space law.

07:11.996 --> 07:14.085
Mineral rights on the moon.

07:14.129 --> 07:16.436
Real estate law on Mars.

07:17.698 --> 07:19.308
Well...

07:19.351 --> 07:21.353
it was nice to meet you.

07:21.397 --> 07:24.487
No, it wasn't. But our
second meeting will go better.

07:24.531 --> 07:26.968
-I grow on people.
-Good to know.

07:29.797 --> 07:32.147
Ms. Durado.

07:32.190 --> 07:34.236
What do Liz and Diane see
in you?

07:34.279 --> 07:36.673
They think I'll be
a figurehead here.

07:36.717 --> 07:39.459
Someone they can manipulate
into agreeing with them.

07:39.502 --> 07:41.025
-They both think that?
-Yes.

07:41.069 --> 07:42.853
Mm. And why do
they both think that?

07:42.897 --> 07:44.333
Because I encourage them to.

07:44.376 --> 07:47.510
I notice, in a partisan world,

07:47.554 --> 07:49.947
the person in the middle
controls the agenda.

07:49.991 --> 07:51.514
Look at Joe Manchin.

07:51.558 --> 07:54.604
His wife didn't even know
he existed last year,

07:54.648 --> 07:57.520
and now he controls America.

08:04.788 --> 08:06.834
Are you shitting me?

08:06.877 --> 08:08.923
David, we are shitting you
about so many things,

08:08.966 --> 08:11.926
-you're gonna have to be
more specific.
-She's a nutbag.

08:11.969 --> 08:13.536
I tell you
to fix your differences,

08:13.580 --> 08:16.800
-you bring me Space Woman.
-Allegra is legendary.

08:16.844 --> 08:19.194
She created and ran
her own law firm.

08:19.237 --> 08:21.718
She has published
groundbreaking legal treatises.

08:21.762 --> 08:23.372
The woman is brilliant, David.

08:23.415 --> 08:25.548
I'm sure, if you want to buy
real estate on the moon.

08:25.592 --> 08:28.203
She's looking into space law,
because it's a way to appeal

08:28.246 --> 08:30.684
to Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.

08:30.727 --> 08:33.077
We're not bringing her on.
You two need to look again.

08:33.121 --> 08:35.079
No. We want her,
and if you're gonna fight us,

08:35.123 --> 08:37.517
you can take it to STR Laurie.

08:37.560 --> 08:39.301
I <i>am</i> STR Laurie.

08:39.344 --> 08:40.955
Let's see if STR Laurie agrees.

08:43.435 --> 08:46.134
I liked you two better
when you hated each other.

08:47.135 --> 08:49.920
<i>The family farm,</i>

08:49.964 --> 08:52.270

with our business partners,
so...

09:14.684 --> 09:17.513
we have a few deal points
still to be worked out.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.210
Would love to get to it today.

10:26.756 --> 10:29.585
<i>That's America,
and that's Plum Meadow Farms.</i>

10:29.629 --> 10:32.544
<i>Now with our new
Cannabis Treats line.</i>

10:32.588 --> 10:35.243
<i>Guy and George Plum were there
at Woodstock</i>

10:35.286 --> 10:38.072
<i>handing out free ice cream
to the flower power generation.</i>

10:38.115 --> 10:39.682
<i>And now we're bringing
a whole new line</i>

10:39.726 --> 10:41.553
<i>of safe and delicious
cannabis products</i>

10:41.597 --> 10:43.817
<i>to the 21st century.</i>

10:43.860 --> 10:45.732
<i>So tune in, turn on,</i>

10:45.775 --> 10:48.865
<i>-and drop by
one of our stores today.
-Okay.</i>

10:50.562 --> 10:54.088
We supply the pot
and cultivation,

10:54.131 --> 10:56.786
and you the distribution.

10:56.830 --> 10:57.874
Yes.

10:57.918 --> 10:59.180
-Bravo.
-Uh, one issue

10:59.223 --> 11:01.748
that we haven't addressed
is the...

11:01.791 --> 11:04.707
cessation of illegal activities
by the parties.

11:04.751 --> 11:07.231
Marijuana is no longer illegal
in Illinois.

11:07.275 --> 11:11.409
Yes. But we want the contract
to take into account the full...

11:11.453 --> 11:15.326
"spectrum" of Mr. Rivi's
previous business model.

11:15.370 --> 11:17.502
What are we talking about here?

11:17.546 --> 11:20.244
Mr. Rivi is involved
with distributing other...

11:20.288 --> 11:23.595
"products"
that are not yet legal.

11:23.639 --> 11:25.815
Um, such as cocaine.

11:31.603 --> 11:33.475
I'm sure you can understand,
Ms. Moyo,

11:33.518 --> 11:36.043
that I need to protect my client
from being held liable

11:36.086 --> 11:37.958
for Mr. Rivi's
illegal activities.

11:38.001 --> 11:39.873
<i>Sigue,</i>'cause I'm brown,

11:39.916 --> 11:43.224
I must be up
to some illegal shit, right?!

11:43.267 --> 11:44.399
-I don't judge. I litigate.
-No, no.

11:46.096 --> 11:47.358
Wait. Wait!

11:47.402 --> 11:49.099
Sidebar!

11:49.143 --> 11:51.101
-Let's all sidebar.

11:51.145 --> 11:53.538
Who the hell are you?

11:53.582 --> 11:56.237
Your lawyer, sir.
And we need to talk.

12:03.635 --> 12:05.681
I-I hear you, Oscar, okay?

12:05.725 --> 12:07.683
But he... he wants your product.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.685
And he needs you
more than you need him.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.513
No, he needs my product, not me.

12:11.556 --> 12:14.603
He'll send me to jail,
then deal with my number two.

12:15.909 --> 12:17.606
Um, whoa, I'm your number two.

12:17.649 --> 12:19.086
You expect me to fuck you?

12:19.129 --> 12:20.957
No, no, no, no, <i>
mami,</i> no, no, no.

12:29.009 --> 12:31.098
O-Okay, p-please don't...
no, don't say that here.

12:31.141 --> 12:34.101
Why don't we take these ideas,
the gummies,

12:34.144 --> 12:36.190
the candy,
and do them ourselves?

12:36.233 --> 12:37.452
We're doing
all the fucking work.

12:37.495 --> 12:38.888
He's coming in with nothing.

12:38.932 --> 12:40.150
No, he's coming in
with brick and mortar.

12:40.194 --> 12:42.152
He's got the infrastructure.

12:42.196 --> 12:44.807
We've got the motherfucking
infrastructure!

12:44.851 --> 12:47.636
Mr. Rivi, what he's giving you
is respectability.

12:47.679 --> 12:50.334
Marijuana is still problematic
with the Feds.

12:50.378 --> 12:52.119
This gets them off your back.

12:52.162 --> 12:53.860
So what do we do?
-Take something from him.

12:53.903 --> 12:58.081
Something he doesn't realize
is worth $550 million.

12:58.125 --> 13:00.170
Like what?

13:00.214 --> 13:01.432
Merchandising.

13:01.476 --> 13:03.304
It's not specified
in the contract.

13:03.347 --> 13:05.872
What? T-shirts and bullshit?

13:05.915 --> 13:06.960
Come on.

13:07.003 --> 13:08.483
Nobody gives a shit.

13:08.526 --> 13:10.441
Ask George Lucas
if he gives a shit.

13:10.485 --> 13:11.965
The <i>Star Wars</i> guy?

13:12.008 --> 13:13.967
What the fuck
does he have to do with this?

13:14.010 --> 13:17.100
20th Century Fox wanted to close
on a contract for <i>Star Wars,</i>

13:17.144 --> 13:20.060
but they were too far apart
on up-front fees.

13:20.103 --> 13:23.454
So Lucas suggested

13:23.498 --> 13:24.586
merchandising.

13:24.629 --> 13:27.284
You know, T-shirts and shit.

13:27.328 --> 13:30.287
Marijuana is not the same
as <i>Star Wars.</i>

13:30.331 --> 13:31.506
-Okay?
-You're right.

13:31.549 --> 13:32.768
It's more addictive.

13:35.989 --> 13:38.078
And where have you been
this whole time?

13:38.121 --> 13:40.602
-Why are you joining us now?
-I was just hired.

13:42.256 --> 13:43.735
<i>Mami.</i>

13:48.784 --> 13:51.047
We want this, Oscar.

13:51.091 --> 13:52.919
Or... I leave you.

13:52.962 --> 13:56.313
<i>Mami.</i> No, no, no, no, no.

14:00.709 --> 14:02.885
My wife Isabel and I, uh,

14:02.929 --> 14:05.235
want her on this negotiation.

14:05.279 --> 14:07.324
Who, Carmen?
You... you've got her.

14:07.368 --> 14:09.109
No, no. The other one.

14:10.197 --> 14:11.633
Allegra.

14:14.810 --> 14:16.768
That can be arranged.

14:16.812 --> 14:18.858
Hmm.

14:34.743 --> 14:36.527
Yo.

14:36.571 --> 14:37.964
-Eight-ball of yay.
-Eight-ball?

14:38.007 --> 14:40.053
All right, it's gonna be $200,
all right?

14:40.096 --> 14:41.141
Not here. Up there.

14:46.581 --> 14:48.452
Got it?

14:51.325 --> 14:52.587
Is that an eighth?

14:52.630 --> 14:53.936
It's what you asked for,
playboy.

14:53.980 --> 14:55.459
-Shit!
-On the ground! On the ground!

14:55.503 --> 14:57.635
On the ground!

14:57.679 --> 14:59.681
-Stay down!
-We didn't do anything wrong.

14:59.724 --> 15:01.030
Got anything
that's gonna stick me?

15:01.074 --> 15:02.597
Yeah, it's just hanging
between my legs.

15:02.640 --> 15:03.946
Yo, reach into my back pocket.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.992
I got a card given to me
by Oscar Rivi.

15:06.035 --> 15:08.472
-It's his lawyer.
He'll get us out in a few hours.
-I doubt it, chief.

15:08.516 --> 15:10.126
-Yeah, you want to bet, pussy?
-I sure do.

15:10.170 --> 15:11.867
We're not going
to the usual court.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.434
Hold on, what? Hold on,
what are you talking about?

15:13.477 --> 15:15.044
-Get up!
-Yeah, you're gonna see.

15:15.088 --> 15:17.917
This, this, boys,
is gonna be interesting.

17:00.976 --> 17:02.543
All rise!

17:02.586 --> 17:05.067
And welcome to <i>Wackner Rules!</i>

17:06.286 --> 17:08.331
What is this? Where are we?

17:09.332 --> 17:11.117
Okay, everybody be seated.

17:11.160 --> 17:12.727
Quiet, please.

17:12.770 --> 17:15.338
No more autographs from Marissa.

17:16.905 --> 17:18.080
Gentlemen,

17:18.124 --> 17:19.908
what's the charge, please?

17:19.951 --> 17:21.605
We caught them dealing,
Your Honor.

17:21.649 --> 17:22.998
Cocaine. Crystal.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.565
We ask that bail be denied.

17:24.608 --> 17:25.827
Thank you, Marissa.

17:25.870 --> 17:27.350
Are they a flight risk,
Officers?

17:27.394 --> 17:29.004
Every corner boy in this city
is a flight risk.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.875
Where's your evidence for that?

17:30.919 --> 17:32.921
-We'll collect some data
for you, Your Honor.
-Please do.

17:32.964 --> 17:35.010
Devil's Advocate,
what do you have to say?

17:38.796 --> 17:40.929
These young men

17:40.972 --> 17:43.410
are the victims of a system

17:43.453 --> 17:47.066
that arbitrarily declares
some drugs illegal

17:47.109 --> 17:50.460
and others, like alcohol, not.

17:50.504 --> 17:52.071
They should be released.

17:52.114 --> 17:54.508
To hold them is to perpetuate
an unfair system.

17:54.551 --> 17:56.379
Bro, what the fuck
kind of court is this?

17:56.423 --> 17:58.773
Seriously?

17:58.816 --> 18:01.950
-Mr. Prosecutor.
-"Perpetuate an unfair system"?

18:01.993 --> 18:05.606
Ask the poor homeowners
in the neighborhoods. Ask 'em.

18:05.649 --> 18:07.912
Ask 'em just how innocent
these drugs are.

18:07.956 --> 18:10.001
They're devastating
the community.

18:10.045 --> 18:12.352
Watch <i>The Wire,
episode "Hamsterdam."</i>

18:12.395 --> 18:15.224
Crime is caused
by criminalizing drugs.

18:15.268 --> 18:16.747
You're talking about a TV show.

18:16.791 --> 18:18.358
Your Honor,

18:18.401 --> 18:20.316
art is just as important
as evidence.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.405
No, Grateful Dead is
just as important.

18:22.449 --> 18:24.581
Defense?

18:24.625 --> 18:26.627
-Come on, Defense.
-Oh.

18:27.845 --> 18:29.630
Your Honor,
this is not a hate crime

18:29.673 --> 18:31.458
in which, I agreed,
it was a good idea

18:31.501 --> 18:33.416
to get a crazy person
off the street.

18:33.460 --> 18:35.723
These cops are asking you
to trust them.

18:35.766 --> 18:37.725
-Where's the evidence?
-Here. These are the drugs

18:37.768 --> 18:39.553
-they were selling.
-Dean.

18:39.596 --> 18:41.598
How do we know
you found these drugs on them?

18:41.642 --> 18:43.252
Are you seriously questioning
our honor?

18:43.296 --> 18:44.993
Defund the police!
Defund the police!

18:45.036 --> 18:46.734
-Shut up! Shut up!
-Defund the poli...

18:46.777 --> 18:48.127
I am questioning the evidence.

18:48.170 --> 18:49.954
That is the point of a trial.

18:49.998 --> 18:51.695
These young men should be taken
to Cook County courthouse.

18:51.739 --> 18:53.175
I didn't do anything wrong.

18:53.219 --> 18:54.959
Your Honor, we should add,
this kid said

18:55.003 --> 18:56.787
if we took him to Cook County
he'd be out within an hour

18:56.831 --> 19:00.269
because he works for Oscar Rivi,
Chicago's answer to El Chapo.

19:00.313 --> 19:02.663
And I hope you notice
the court clerk's reaction

19:02.706 --> 19:07.189
to the name Rivi,
because her firm defends him.

19:07.233 --> 19:09.539
-Is that true?
-We defend a lot of people.

19:09.583 --> 19:12.673
Boo!
-Okay, here's how we'll
leave it. I'm denying bail.

19:12.716 --> 19:15.066
-Your Honor!
-No, no, nobody gets
everything they want.

19:15.110 --> 19:17.286
-Defund the police! Defund...
-You either... Hey, hey, hey!

19:17.330 --> 19:18.983
Settle down!

19:19.027 --> 19:21.508
We'll hold these two boys
for 48 hours.

19:21.551 --> 19:23.292
Then I want to hear more
on this evidence.

19:23.336 --> 19:24.946
You wanted a trial,
Ms. Court Clerk?

19:24.989 --> 19:26.339
-You got one.

19:31.213 --> 19:32.780
<i>So...</i>

19:32.823 --> 19:34.608
you sandbagged me.

19:34.651 --> 19:37.045
-What are you talking about?
-I told you to get rid of her,

19:37.088 --> 19:39.134
and you hooked her up with Rivi.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.875
-Oh, my God, David,
you're so paranoid.
-I mean, why would...

19:40.918 --> 19:42.311
Well, now it's your problem.

19:42.355 --> 19:44.095
I took it to STR Laurie,

19:44.139 --> 19:47.229
and they're not kicking in
any more for infrastructure.

19:47.273 --> 19:49.623
So find yourselves ten percent
in savings

19:49.666 --> 19:52.234
-for your Space Lady.
-Well, we never filled
Boseman's position, so...

19:52.278 --> 19:54.410
Uh, she's not Boseman.

19:54.454 --> 19:56.107
No. She's not.

19:56.151 --> 19:58.327
She has more stature, David.

19:58.371 --> 20:00.764
-This is your moronic misogyny.

20:00.808 --> 20:02.418
That is such bullshit.

20:02.462 --> 20:04.464
Every time you two
don't like something,

20:04.507 --> 20:06.422
you hurl misogyny or racism.

20:06.466 --> 20:08.555
Well, sometimes
a woman isn't as good,

20:08.598 --> 20:10.600
and a Black person isn't,
either.

20:10.644 --> 20:13.690
Oh, God. Says the old white guy.

20:13.734 --> 20:16.040
Ten percent.
We have a conference call

20:16.084 --> 20:18.042
with Dubai on Thursday

20:18.086 --> 20:20.871
to tell them where the savings
are coming from.

20:20.915 --> 20:23.961
My clients really want
to make this work.

20:24.005 --> 20:26.399
They are prepared
to accept the...

20:26.442 --> 20:28.488
irregularities of your books.

20:28.531 --> 20:29.880
No irregularities.

20:29.924 --> 20:32.100
Our business was illegal
prior to 2020.

20:32.143 --> 20:35.321
Understood and reservedly accepted.

20:35.364 --> 20:36.844
We've also agreed

20:36.887 --> 20:38.628
to your extraordinary
merchandising rider.

20:38.672 --> 20:40.282
The only thing extraordinary

20:40.326 --> 20:42.589
is that you consider it
extraordinary.

20:42.632 --> 20:44.504
<i>Mami.
But you have to understand</i>

20:44.547 --> 20:48.203
that your legal issues greatly
increase our exposure to risk.

20:48.247 --> 20:51.772
And our insurance premiums
have risen exponentially,

20:51.815 --> 20:54.078
so we ask that you share
that risk.

20:54.122 --> 20:55.341
No.

20:59.345 --> 21:01.738
We cannot in good conscience
sign this deal

21:01.782 --> 21:03.740
without your agreement
to share...

21:03.784 --> 21:05.873
Then let's get
the hell out of here.

21:05.916 --> 21:07.788
Corporate America thinks
they can fuck me

21:07.831 --> 21:09.224
in my own house. <i>!¡Mira!</i>

21:09.268 --> 21:10.486
You need this deal, Mr. Rivi.

21:10.530 --> 21:12.140
No, you need
to stop fucking with us,

21:12.183 --> 21:15.099
or we walk across the street
to Ben & Jerry's.

21:22.063 --> 21:23.673
Next.

21:29.810 --> 21:31.899
-All right.

21:32.900 --> 21:34.902
Thank you.
Let's do some good here.

21:34.945 --> 21:36.338
I cannot wait.

21:36.382 --> 21:38.514
<i>-Salud.
-Salud.</i>

21:41.430 --> 21:43.606
-Nice work.
-I've been missing this.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.220
If we consolidate incidentals...

21:49.264 --> 21:51.614
Yeah, that's-that's maybe,
like, one percent.

21:51.658 --> 21:54.225
Well, I'm not firing
any more associates.

21:54.269 --> 21:56.489
Yeah, well,
you act like I want to.

21:56.532 --> 21:58.229
What do you think, Allegra?

21:59.230 --> 22:02.016
I think hire back
all the associates you fired

22:02.059 --> 22:03.931
and add 20% more.

22:03.974 --> 22:06.412
I-I don't think you're hearing

22:06.455 --> 22:08.196
the issue here, Allegra--
we need to reduce.

22:08.239 --> 22:09.240
Why?

22:10.633 --> 22:12.592
Because we don't run
our own business.

22:12.635 --> 22:14.376
We work
for a global conglomerate.

22:14.420 --> 22:17.684
STR Laurie has an annual revenue

22:17.727 --> 22:19.773
of over $4 billion,

22:19.816 --> 22:22.906
or 14.6 billion dirham.

22:22.950 --> 22:25.387
Why would they need us
to cut anything?

22:25.431 --> 22:27.084
Even our toenails?

22:27.128 --> 22:28.999
Our income is down
because of the pandemic.

22:29.043 --> 22:32.351
No. We're in an economy bloated
by federal dollars

22:32.394 --> 22:34.570
and a populace hungry
for revenge.

22:34.614 --> 22:36.746
Business is about to explode.

22:36.790 --> 22:39.749
We need to argue that
our clients will leave us

22:39.793 --> 22:41.969
if they keep thinking
we're cutting.

22:42.012 --> 22:43.753
Oh, because they will.

22:45.015 --> 22:47.670
If income is down, don't cut.

22:47.714 --> 22:49.106
Build.

22:55.983 --> 22:57.419
So, what do you think?

22:57.463 --> 22:59.943
I think we made a mistake
going with Allegra.

23:00.901 --> 23:04.078
So she shouldn't be
on the Zoom call with Dubai.

23:09.823 --> 23:11.346
Hey.

23:11.390 --> 23:14.610
I thought you
were gonna kick Diane out.

23:14.654 --> 23:16.307
No. No, no, no, no, no.

23:16.351 --> 23:19.746
It's just that, uh, some
of the partners want her to...

23:19.789 --> 23:21.574
take a step...

23:21.617 --> 23:23.010
step down.

23:23.053 --> 23:24.228
What do you want?

23:24.272 --> 23:26.622
I want to stop fighting.

23:26.666 --> 23:28.494
I want, uh...

23:28.537 --> 23:31.975
I want her to stop using her
racist clients to keep her job,

23:32.019 --> 23:33.499
and I...

23:33.542 --> 23:37.459
I just want the firm to be led
in the right way

23:37.503 --> 23:39.287
by the right people.

23:39.330 --> 23:42.029
So you bring on a third partner
to appease her?

23:43.030 --> 23:45.249
Can I say something?
Just one thing.

23:45.293 --> 23:46.512
Come.

23:46.555 --> 23:48.557
Women...

23:48.601 --> 23:52.518
women at work always want
to be thought of as nice.

23:52.561 --> 23:54.389
-Oh, my God.
-No, no, no, no, no, look, look.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.478
-Okay.
-Women always want consensus.

23:56.522 --> 23:59.220
But you know what, baby?
Sometimes you just got to say,

23:59.263 --> 24:00.743
"Fuck you...

24:00.787 --> 24:02.745
you and you and you."

24:02.789 --> 24:04.965
All right? "This is my business,
and it's my decision."

24:05.008 --> 24:08.055
-Okay, thank you, Al Capone.
-No, I'm serious.

24:08.098 --> 24:10.231
Look, Diane stretched
this whole thing out,

24:10.274 --> 24:12.015
and she's playing
to your sweet side.

24:12.059 --> 24:15.323
Okay, can... I-I-I deal
with this all day at work.

24:15.366 --> 24:17.412
Can we just...

24:17.456 --> 24:20.328
talk about something else,
anything else less problematic?

24:20.371 --> 24:22.504
Please? Please, please, please.
Thank you.

24:22.548 --> 24:23.723
Palestine.

24:25.986 --> 24:28.162
-God.
-Okay, seriously, though.

24:28.205 --> 24:29.903
Here's the real subject.

24:30.947 --> 24:34.124
-Uh-oh.
-Uh, no, no, no, no, no.

24:35.125 --> 24:38.259
My boss wants me
to come back to L.A.

24:39.260 --> 24:41.654
Your boss? Wait, I thought...
I thought you were the boss.

24:41.697 --> 24:44.744
I am the boss,
but the boss always has a boss.

24:44.787 --> 24:46.528
Why L.A.?

24:46.572 --> 24:49.531
Chicago was always supposed
to be temporary.

24:49.575 --> 24:51.664
But then, dang it...

24:51.707 --> 24:53.404
I went and fell for...

24:53.448 --> 24:55.232
Chicago.

24:55.276 --> 24:57.234
The stand-up...

24:57.278 --> 24:59.846
-and the pizza...
-Yeah.

24:59.889 --> 25:01.935
You.

25:03.676 --> 25:08.202
So we should have
this conversation now.

25:09.595 --> 25:10.987
Okay, you start.

25:11.031 --> 25:13.033
No, no, no, no.
I'm terrible at this.

25:13.076 --> 25:16.210
No, wait, I-I thought that all
men are much better at saying

25:16.253 --> 25:18.604
-exactly what they mean.

25:22.390 --> 25:26.481
Do you want me to stay
or go back to L.A.?

25:26.525 --> 25:28.788
What do you want?

25:29.789 --> 25:31.834
I do like the stand-up.

25:31.878 --> 25:34.184
I love the pizza.

25:37.013 --> 25:41.583
Well, then you should stay.

25:41.627 --> 25:43.454
Is that a good idea?

25:43.498 --> 25:46.849
Um, yeah. I mean, if you like
the stand-up and the pizza,

25:46.893 --> 25:48.895
then sure.

25:52.115 --> 25:54.248
Okay.

26:09.872 --> 26:11.918
What?

26:16.705 --> 26:18.751
Cops?

26:21.797 --> 26:23.538
Fuck.

26:27.411 --> 26:30.066
We've checked every district,
and they're not there.

26:34.680 --> 26:37.639
What about Homan Square?

26:37.683 --> 26:39.946
It's not operational anymore.

26:40.903 --> 26:43.732
The cops won't give up
the black sites.

26:56.049 --> 26:58.051
The question is, who?

26:58.094 --> 27:00.357
We thought you might have ideas.

27:03.273 --> 27:04.623
<i>Una.</i>

27:13.719 --> 27:16.025
That piece of shit over there.

27:16.069 --> 27:17.723
They wouldn't do that, Oscar.

27:17.766 --> 27:19.463
You're right.

27:19.507 --> 27:22.292
They'll just get their
cop friends to do it for them.

28:20.829 --> 28:22.788
You think I fucking care
about your dumbass cows?

28:22.831 --> 28:24.703
It was a professional hit.

28:24.746 --> 28:26.356
Do you know
how stupid you sound?

28:26.400 --> 28:28.315
You want to bust this deal,
you're doing a great job.

28:28.358 --> 28:30.230
No, no, no, no, no,
we didn't do shit!

28:30.273 --> 28:32.188
You kidnapped
our employees, man!

28:32.232 --> 28:33.842
Fancy! Well, you want
to describe to us

28:33.886 --> 28:35.235
how you think that went down?

28:35.278 --> 28:37.019
We didn't do shit!
-Marissa.

28:37.063 --> 28:38.847
-Can we please talk about this
another time?
-No.

28:38.891 --> 28:40.327
I know where
his missing dealers are.

28:40.370 --> 28:42.808
-What? Where?
-Wackner's court.

28:42.851 --> 28:46.115
No, but I-I don't understand.
What-what are they doing there?

28:46.159 --> 28:47.769
-They're being held for trial.
-What trial?

28:47.813 --> 28:49.858
It's not a real court.

28:49.902 --> 28:51.599
The police are using it.

28:51.642 --> 28:53.819
They arrest drug dealers
and bring them to our court.

28:53.862 --> 28:56.343
Oh, my God. They're
about to go to war in there.

28:56.386 --> 28:58.084
Wait, wait, wait.
You have to stop Rivi

28:58.127 --> 28:59.172
from going apeshit--
he'll kill Wackner.

28:59.215 --> 29:00.651
Marissa, we have to tell him.

29:00.695 --> 29:02.479
Okay. But the cops are not
on your side.

29:02.523 --> 29:05.221
Wackner will let those corner
boys go, just give him a chance.

29:05.265 --> 29:08.007
Marissa, if I don't tell Rivi,
he's gonna kill <i>those</i> guys.

29:08.050 --> 29:09.835
So then tell him,
but keep him in check

29:09.878 --> 29:11.575
until we can get
his employees released.

29:11.619 --> 29:13.186
Oh, God.

29:13.229 --> 29:14.927
Law school never prepared me
for this.

29:14.970 --> 29:17.103
Did you really think that
you could just walk in here

29:17.146 --> 29:18.582
-with your fancy...
-Okay, you know,

29:18.626 --> 29:20.628
-I'm just gonna go get Liz.
-Yeah, yeah.

29:20.671 --> 29:22.325
You son of a whore!

29:24.763 --> 29:26.503
Who is this man?
Hal Wackner.

29:26.547 --> 29:27.809
He runs an alternative court.

29:27.853 --> 29:29.376
Usually just
small claims issues.

29:29.419 --> 29:31.204
Well, have him bring
our men back immediately.

29:31.247 --> 29:33.206
We will go to him right now
and plead their case.

29:33.249 --> 29:34.511
Their case?

29:34.555 --> 29:36.600
Their fucking case?
Who are you?

29:36.644 --> 29:39.299
-Marissa Gold.
-Well, Marissa Gold,
there is no case.

29:39.342 --> 29:42.563
If there was a case,
she is our lawyer!

29:42.606 --> 29:44.173
Yes, but I have a relationship
with Hal.

29:44.217 --> 29:45.958
-Trust me, I'm the one you want.
-No, no, no, no, no, no.

29:46.001 --> 29:48.961
-She is our lawyer!
-Yes, and Carmen...

29:49.004 --> 29:51.267
will explain this to Hal

29:51.311 --> 29:53.008
and get this cleaned up
immediately.

29:53.052 --> 29:54.531
Well, why not that Allegra lady?

29:54.575 --> 29:56.838
No. She doesn't have
as much sway.

29:56.882 --> 29:58.884
Carmen will get
your employees released.

29:58.927 --> 30:01.234
And I will reach out
to Carter Schmidt

30:01.277 --> 30:04.106
and see if we can repair things
with, uh...

30:04.150 --> 30:05.804
-with Plum Meadow.

30:07.849 --> 30:11.070
So, we'll get right on this,
and we will speak in an hour.

30:17.511 --> 30:20.514
Greetings from STR Laurie
in Chicago.

30:20.557 --> 30:23.691
What's the temperature
in Dubai and London?

30:23.734 --> 30:25.649
<i>-Hot.
-Rainy.</i>

30:25.693 --> 30:27.695
Good to know.

30:27.738 --> 30:29.871
Thank you for making time
for this call.

30:29.915 --> 30:33.527
I think you know our
name partners, Diane Lockhart

30:33.570 --> 30:35.921
-and Liz Reddick... <i>
-What do you have for us?</i>

30:35.964 --> 30:38.662
<i>As you can see
from the proposed budget,</i>

30:38.706 --> 30:43.711
<i>uh, Liz and Diane have taken
your guidance very seriously.</i>

30:43.754 --> 30:46.801
We are not quite at ten percent,
but we are getting there.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.847
These things can be delicate.

30:48.890 --> 30:51.588
<i>Sorry, I'm having problems
with my computer,</i>

30:51.632 --> 30:53.764
<i>so I'm on my iPad.</i>

30:53.808 --> 30:55.114
Oh, God.

30:55.157 --> 30:57.072
Uh, A-Allegra, we...

30:57.116 --> 31:00.684
uh, we said we didn't need you
to be at this.

31:00.728 --> 31:03.078
<i>Uh, we-we want to introduce you
to the team properly.</i>

31:03.122 --> 31:05.124
<i>No, no, I'm here.</i>

31:05.167 --> 31:08.475
Allegra, there's something wrong
with your Zoom.

31:08.518 --> 31:10.651
You... you have a cat's face.

31:10.694 --> 31:12.958
-I have a what?
Uh, you-you have
a filter on

31:13.001 --> 31:14.873
that-that looks like a cat.

31:14.916 --> 31:16.178
Huh. Oh.

31:16.222 --> 31:17.876
So I do.

31:17.919 --> 31:20.356
<i>I let my niece use my iPad
this weekend.</i>

31:20.400 --> 31:22.010
<i>She was having fun</i>

31:22.054 --> 31:23.011
with her friends.

31:23.055 --> 31:24.839
Let's see here.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.449
Okay, is this better?

31:26.493 --> 31:28.930
No. That's
just a different breed.

31:28.974 --> 31:30.236
<i>Oh.</i>

31:30.279 --> 31:31.541
Well, I guess
we're stuck with it.

31:31.585 --> 31:32.978
<i>But you can hear me, right?</i>

31:33.021 --> 31:34.501
I'm afraid so.

31:34.544 --> 31:37.156
Good. Because I've thought a lot
about this issue.

31:37.199 --> 31:38.984
I happen to have researched

31:39.027 --> 31:41.160
Sharia financial law,

31:41.203 --> 31:43.292
<i>-and I have a few thoughts.
-We need to shut her down now.</i>

31:43.336 --> 31:45.599
-Right. <i>
-In Sharia law,
you're not supposed</i>

31:45.642 --> 31:47.862
<i>to charge or pay interest.</i>

31:47.906 --> 31:51.344
Now, I know you guys wouldn't
have all those tall buildings

31:51.387 --> 31:55.522
<i>without a little necessary
borrowing, now, would you?</i>

32:03.660 --> 32:04.966
Who is this cat?

32:05.010 --> 32:06.533
Sir, I am not a cat.

32:06.576 --> 32:08.839
Holy fuck. <i>
-My point is,</i>

32:08.883 --> 32:10.885
there's a certain level of...

32:10.929 --> 32:13.105
I wouldn't say hypocrisy,

32:13.148 --> 32:15.977
but maybe... flexibility?

32:16.021 --> 32:19.633
So when you think of us,
think of Emirates Airlines.

32:19.676 --> 32:22.462
That's why you invested
in this firm.

32:24.333 --> 32:25.247
Come on.

32:28.076 --> 32:29.643
-Uh, uh...

32:29.686 --> 32:31.340
I-I'm being called away.

32:31.384 --> 32:32.820
Meow.

32:34.822 --> 32:36.432
Sorry, sorry.

32:37.433 --> 32:39.479
Admittedly...

32:39.522 --> 32:40.741
the filter wasn't great.

32:40.784 --> 32:42.351
But I stand by what I said.

32:42.395 --> 32:44.092
It was the right strategy.

32:44.136 --> 32:45.702
I know those kind of men.

32:45.746 --> 32:47.704
-They respond to flexed biceps.
Allegra,

32:47.748 --> 32:49.924
uh, we need to talk.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.926
We aren't sure
this is gonna work out.

32:54.276 --> 32:55.843
I understand.

32:55.886 --> 32:57.888
I'm an acquired taste.

32:57.932 --> 33:00.935
Hmm, just tell me
when you want me out of here.

33:06.158 --> 33:08.029
Your Honor, uh...

33:08.073 --> 33:10.814
Your-Your Honor,
I-I represent the-the boys

33:10.858 --> 33:12.077
-you've detained.
"Boys"?

33:13.078 --> 33:14.688
Really? They're 19.

33:14.731 --> 33:16.951
Uh, Your Honor, it's not
important how old they are.

33:16.995 --> 33:19.040
They're-they're not...
criminals.

33:19.084 --> 33:22.261
This is Kewame James,

33:22.304 --> 33:23.871
one of the youths
you've incarcerated.

33:23.914 --> 33:26.352
He takes care of his father,
who has emphysema,

33:26.395 --> 33:28.180
and his two baby sisters.

33:28.223 --> 33:29.790
Music, Phil.

33:32.749 --> 33:35.100
Uh, his-his life is a struggle.

33:35.143 --> 33:37.798
He can barely keep above water
as he tries to keep his family

33:37.841 --> 33:39.017
-above water.
Oh, please.

33:39.060 --> 33:40.888
He also sells drugs.

33:40.931 --> 33:43.543
Please spare me
all the social media crap.

33:43.586 --> 33:45.806
You should see what these
"families" are really like,

33:45.849 --> 33:47.416
what these people are like.

33:47.460 --> 33:50.419
"These people"?
A-Are we judging based on race?

33:50.463 --> 33:53.074
No, that is political nonsense.

33:53.118 --> 33:55.337
And, Your Honor,
take a look at who just walked

33:55.381 --> 33:57.731
into the courtroom.

33:57.774 --> 34:00.168
-Wrong music, Phil. Oscar Rivi.

34:00.212 --> 34:02.779
One of the top drug dealers
in Chicago.

34:02.823 --> 34:03.911
Your Honor, that is prejudice.

34:03.954 --> 34:05.565
Mr. Rivi just signed a deal

34:05.608 --> 34:07.741
with the top yogurt distributor
on the East Coast,

34:07.784 --> 34:09.830
-Plum Meadow Farms.
That is insane.

34:09.873 --> 34:12.137
-I mean, they can make up
whatever they want.
-I would agree.

34:12.180 --> 34:13.790
-Sounds pretty improbable.
Actually, Your Honor,

34:13.834 --> 34:16.097
I can swear to that.
I was there for the signing.

34:16.141 --> 34:17.794
Your Honor,
I am now a respectable...

34:17.838 --> 34:19.231
businessman.

34:19.274 --> 34:22.147
My friends and employees
should not be judged

34:22.190 --> 34:23.887
by their skin color
or background...

34:23.931 --> 34:25.324
-This is bullshit, Your Honor.
-You see?

34:25.367 --> 34:28.631
The police wants to judge me
for my old ways.

34:28.675 --> 34:31.286
But where is their forgiveness,
Your Honor?

34:31.330 --> 34:33.158
And why are my three employees
being judged

34:33.201 --> 34:35.595
by my past sins?

34:35.638 --> 34:38.685
Your Honor,
we ask that you release them.

34:38.728 --> 34:41.035
How many of his employees
are we currently holding

34:41.079 --> 34:43.646
-in Cord's prison?
-Two, Your Honor--
Kewame and Andres.

34:43.690 --> 34:44.647
No, no, no,

34:44.691 --> 34:47.259
Kewame, Andres and Matteo.

34:47.302 --> 34:48.782
No, I only have two.

34:48.825 --> 34:51.089
Maybe Matteo called in sick
that day.

34:52.090 --> 34:53.874
No, he did not.

34:53.917 --> 34:57.878
Or maybe he took a "me" day
for self-care.

34:57.921 --> 35:00.533
-Do you give your employees
wellness days?
Uh, Your Honor,

35:00.576 --> 35:03.144
-we're certain
three youths were taken.
Not by us.

35:03.188 --> 35:05.103
Rivi wants to set you up,
Your Honor.

35:05.146 --> 35:06.669
Your Honor...

35:06.713 --> 35:07.844
please...

35:07.888 --> 35:09.846
do not fuck with me.

35:09.890 --> 35:11.544
No one is fucking with you, sir.

35:11.587 --> 35:13.589
Maybe you should take
a self-care day, too.

35:13.633 --> 35:15.113
For your own good.

35:24.644 --> 35:26.036
<i>!¡Puta!</i>

35:37.787 --> 35:40.138
Heard about court today.

35:42.575 --> 35:45.012
Wackner--
it-it sounds like it was wild.

35:45.055 --> 35:47.101
Yeah, it was exciting.

35:48.842 --> 35:51.279
How do you deal with liability?

35:51.323 --> 35:53.499
The usual. Releases.

35:53.542 --> 35:56.023
You'd be surprised how
many people want to be on TV.

35:56.066 --> 36:00.027
-Yeah, Rivi doesn't.
-Mm, not your drug lord, no, no.

36:00.070 --> 36:02.247
But there are ways around that.

36:02.290 --> 36:04.901
Just talk to the TV show <i>Cops.</i>

36:04.945 --> 36:06.468
Uh-oh.

36:06.512 --> 36:10.037
Maybe I shouldn't have said that
to his legal team.

36:10.080 --> 36:12.518
Nuh-uh. No. No.

36:12.561 --> 36:14.868
No, I was just...

36:14.911 --> 36:17.087
I don't know,
I was just thinking about...

36:17.131 --> 36:18.524
<i>The Apprentice.</i>

36:18.567 --> 36:21.875
Remember how we all watched
and laughed

36:21.918 --> 36:24.312
and thought it was funny
when they fired people?

36:24.356 --> 36:25.922
We? No, no.

36:25.966 --> 36:27.794
Hmm, you... you never watched <i>
The Apprentice.</i>

36:27.837 --> 36:29.404
-Okay, no, no, no.
-No.

36:29.448 --> 36:32.190
But, you know,
my friends did, and...

36:32.233 --> 36:35.541
you know,
then <i>he</i> became president.

36:35.584 --> 36:39.893
I think in large part
because of that program.

36:39.936 --> 36:42.374
So you're afraid
of Wackner becoming president?

36:42.417 --> 36:44.245
No. Oh, God.

36:44.289 --> 36:47.248
God forbid.
But aren't you...

36:47.292 --> 36:49.772
Do you want to become
Mark Burnett?

36:50.773 --> 36:53.472
-That came out of nowhere.
-No. It didn't.

36:53.515 --> 36:58.128
Mm... there are lines
being crossed everywhere.

36:58.172 --> 37:01.131
Do your clients cross lines?

37:02.132 --> 37:03.395
Excuse me?

37:03.438 --> 37:05.179
-You represent Wackner.
-Oh, yeah.

37:05.223 --> 37:07.007
We... tried to get rid of him.

37:07.050 --> 37:10.271
You represent murderers,
rapists, drug dealers.

37:10.315 --> 37:14.841
Your client tried to choke
my star tonight.

37:14.884 --> 37:16.799
But-but you're okay with him.

37:16.843 --> 37:21.021
So... so what is wrong with
Mark Burnett in your universe?

37:21.064 --> 37:22.196
Hmm?

37:22.240 --> 37:24.503
Would your firm turn him down

37:24.546 --> 37:26.853
if he wanted
to join the roster? Hmm?

37:30.117 --> 37:32.032
Good point.

37:33.033 --> 37:35.340
-Really?
-Yeah.

37:36.602 --> 37:39.169
Because...

37:39.213 --> 37:42.608
-you don't look like
it was a good point.
-No, no.

37:44.131 --> 37:46.176
No, I meant it.

37:52.444 --> 37:54.707
Do you want me
to go back to L.A.?

37:55.882 --> 37:56.970
No.

37:57.013 --> 37:58.363
Uh...

37:58.406 --> 37:59.929
no, I don't want that.

37:59.973 --> 38:02.802
But maybe it's
what you're meant to do. I...

38:03.803 --> 38:05.326
Liz...

38:05.370 --> 38:07.589
my work is just that--

38:07.633 --> 38:09.069
work.

38:09.112 --> 38:11.506
I know.

38:11.550 --> 38:13.291
Mine, too.

38:25.607 --> 38:28.306
No. Wackner only processed two.
There wasn't a third.

38:28.349 --> 38:30.786
What? Maybe you just don't know
about the third.

38:30.830 --> 38:32.571
Carmen, I was here
when they brought them in.

38:32.614 --> 38:34.486
If they were hiding
someone else, I would know.

38:34.529 --> 38:36.444
Okay, Wackner is not obliged
to inform you

38:36.488 --> 38:37.750
about his every move.

38:37.793 --> 38:39.534
Okay? We have no idea

38:39.578 --> 38:41.797
-what that guy
is really thinking.
-You won him over

38:41.841 --> 38:43.582
with your argument, Carmen.

38:43.625 --> 38:45.888
If he released the two,
he would have released a third.

38:45.932 --> 38:47.760
Look, I...

38:47.803 --> 38:50.153
I don't know why you've
been wasting so much time

38:50.197 --> 38:51.851
with this joke court.

38:52.895 --> 38:54.636
Because it's not gonna magically

38:54.680 --> 38:57.160
turn you into a real lawyer,
Marissa.

39:10.435 --> 39:12.611
Jay, I need your help.

39:17.964 --> 39:21.402
I've asked Liz and Diane
to let me argue to you

39:21.446 --> 39:23.709
before we decide
on our next step.

39:23.752 --> 39:24.927
What next step?

39:24.971 --> 39:26.755
Our next step is you go away.

39:26.799 --> 39:29.541
I realize I didn't present
my argument effectively.

39:29.584 --> 39:32.370
Oh, really?
You mean with a cat face?

39:33.458 --> 39:35.547
Look, I-I've been to Dubai,

39:35.590 --> 39:38.463
as part of a commission
on women's rights.

39:38.506 --> 39:40.900
When I was planning my trip,

39:40.943 --> 39:44.686
everyone said, "You've got
to fly Emirates Airlines."

39:44.730 --> 39:46.906
"Why," I asked.
"Reasonable fares?

39:46.949 --> 39:48.777
Friendly service?"

39:48.821 --> 39:51.998
"No. Marble showers."

39:52.041 --> 39:53.652
-What are you talking about?
-Emirates Airlines

39:53.695 --> 39:56.045
saw a decline in business travel

39:56.089 --> 39:58.657
throughout 2016 and 2018,

39:58.700 --> 40:02.443
so they brought in an American
troubleshooter to advise.

40:02.487 --> 40:04.314
The troubleshooter said,

40:04.358 --> 40:07.796
"Lay off 30% of airline staff."

40:07.840 --> 40:09.798
You know what
the airline did instead?

40:09.842 --> 40:12.322
Wear a cat face for investors?

40:13.323 --> 40:16.414
They put marble showers
on their airplanes!

40:16.457 --> 40:20.505
That's who these people are,
where they come from.

40:20.548 --> 40:22.942
They don't respect
"sensible outlays."

40:22.985 --> 40:25.814
They respect excess
and strength.

40:25.858 --> 40:28.251
We let them nickel-and-dime us,

40:28.295 --> 40:29.688
we're on a downward spiral.

40:29.731 --> 40:32.386
We need to go right back at them

40:32.430 --> 40:34.432
and say, "This is what we need,

40:34.475 --> 40:38.044
because this is what
you deserve from a law firm."

40:40.438 --> 40:41.961
No.

40:42.004 --> 40:43.963
<i>What do you mean, "No"?</i>

40:44.006 --> 40:48.271
<i>I mean, I don't think we should
cut ten percent out of our firm.</i>

40:48.315 --> 40:51.057
<i>In fact, we need to hire more.</i>

40:51.100 --> 40:53.276
<i>This is not a request, Mr. Lee.</i>

40:55.017 --> 40:58.543
Recently, I was planning a trip
to the Middle East,

40:58.586 --> 41:03.504
and everyone told me, "You
have to fly Emirates Airlines."

41:03.548 --> 41:05.158
You know why?

41:06.725 --> 41:08.944
Marble showers.

41:14.123 --> 41:16.343
-So what do I do?
-Nothing.

41:16.386 --> 41:17.953
You let me talk.

41:17.997 --> 41:20.216
-I can't help?
-No.

41:20.260 --> 41:23.132
Stay right there.
Don't do anything.

41:24.656 --> 41:26.092
I will.

41:27.267 --> 41:29.095
What's up?

41:33.273 --> 41:35.014
I'm not a cop.

41:35.057 --> 41:36.972
-Okay.
-I'm looking for a kid
who's gone missing.

41:37.016 --> 41:39.061
Used to hang out on this block.

41:39.105 --> 41:40.846
Named Matteo.

41:43.805 --> 41:45.503
Yeah.

41:57.427 --> 41:59.952
"Subject to arrest"?

42:19.058 --> 42:21.669
Now, Mike and Roger,

42:21.713 --> 42:24.585
this is a tough case...

42:24.629 --> 42:28.328
but, Mike, we all know
your dog pooped in Roger's yard.

42:28.371 --> 42:30.678
But, Your Honor,
he has no poop proof.

42:30.722 --> 42:32.637
-Where's the footage?
-Mike...

42:32.680 --> 42:34.987
your dog poops everywhere. <i>
Everywhere.</i>

42:35.030 --> 42:37.206
I sentence you
to clean Roger's shoes

42:37.250 --> 42:39.513
and have that dog
properly potty trained.

42:39.557 --> 42:42.560
Case closed, and God is good.

42:42.603 --> 42:45.606
All the time.
-And all the time, God is good!

42:45.650 --> 42:46.868
God is good.

42:46.912 --> 42:48.217
Well, I'll be darned.

42:48.261 --> 42:51.917
-Marissa Gold from the show?
-Oh.

42:51.960 --> 42:53.962
We got ourselves
a real-life celebrity!

42:54.006 --> 42:56.399
What are you doing here?

42:56.443 --> 42:57.618
Uh, Ms. Clark...

42:57.662 --> 42:59.185
Hmm, Vinetta.

42:59.228 --> 43:01.883
Or, uh, Judge Vinetta,
if we're in chambers.

43:01.927 --> 43:03.406
Vinetta.

43:03.450 --> 43:05.234
We wanted to know
if you recognize this youth.

43:05.278 --> 43:08.150
-Oh, yeah, Matteo.
-Do you know him?

43:08.194 --> 43:09.630
From my basement.

43:11.066 --> 43:12.894
He's in your basement?

43:12.938 --> 43:14.504
He's in a time-out.

43:16.594 --> 43:19.814
-He's in a voluntary time-out?
-Well, it depends on what
you mean by "voluntary."

43:19.858 --> 43:21.903
But, look, I will say this--

43:21.947 --> 43:24.166
ever since I started up my court

43:24.210 --> 43:27.213
and began putting
kids like Matteo in time-out,

43:27.256 --> 43:30.390
the neighborhood has been great.

43:31.391 --> 43:33.088
Can we see him?

43:34.437 --> 43:36.135
Sure.

43:37.702 --> 43:39.268
Matteo?

43:39.312 --> 43:41.270
-Yes, ma'am?
-Hear that? Manners.

43:41.314 --> 43:43.490
I've got some people here
to see you.

43:43.533 --> 43:45.231
How you doing, child?

43:45.274 --> 43:47.537
I'm okay. Ma'am.

43:47.581 --> 43:49.409
This bread pudding is amazing.

43:49.452 --> 43:51.454
Did we forget to say something?

43:51.498 --> 43:53.848
-Thank you, Miss Vinetta.
-Right!

43:53.892 --> 43:55.850
Okay, you're a work in progress,

43:55.894 --> 43:58.374
-but we're
gonna get you there, son.
Matteo,

43:58.418 --> 44:00.942
-do you need anything?
-Some more of that brisket
from last night.

44:00.986 --> 44:02.727
Boy, you better quit.

44:02.770 --> 44:04.772
You had three servings
of that brisket.

44:04.816 --> 44:06.948
Ooh, God is good.

44:06.992 --> 44:09.821
-All the time.
Vinetta, you need
to let him out of time-out.

44:09.864 --> 44:12.214
-After his trial.
He's one
of Oscar Rivi's boys.

44:12.258 --> 44:14.129
Rivi wants him back.

44:14.173 --> 44:15.696
I don't care whose boy he is.

44:15.740 --> 44:17.437
Oscar Rivi is
a very dangerous man.

44:18.438 --> 44:20.962
I've got God on my side.

44:21.006 --> 44:23.704
You're welcome to defend him
if you wish.

44:23.748 --> 44:26.707
Ooh, it would be an honor
to have Marissa Gold try a case

44:26.751 --> 44:28.143
in my court.

44:28.187 --> 44:30.450
-When's that?
-Tomorrow.

44:34.628 --> 44:36.848
I'm sorry.

44:36.891 --> 44:38.719
What?

44:38.763 --> 44:40.068
It's another court.

44:40.112 --> 44:42.244
And she has Matteo,
the third kid.

44:43.637 --> 44:45.204
You're kidding.

44:45.247 --> 44:46.771
No.

44:47.772 --> 44:49.730
You know what we got to do?

44:49.774 --> 44:52.211
-Get Matteo out.
-No.

44:52.254 --> 44:54.300
I got to see this.

44:55.605 --> 44:57.564
It's finally happening.

44:57.607 --> 44:59.479
What's happening?

45:01.481 --> 45:03.439
Justice.
