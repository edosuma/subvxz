I -- I don't understand.

I -- I mean, I saw the picture
on Kyle's phone.

18:25.612 --> 18:27.111
They just put up a sign.

18:27.113 --> 18:28.512
Yeah, we did.

that would be wrong.

18:30.549 --> 18:31.814
Whoa.
Hear that?

18:31.816 --> 18:33.715
Ryan just admitted
he's wrong.

Uh, it was actually something
you said to me earlier, Mike.

18:38.887 --> 18:40.286
What'd you say?

18:40.288 --> 18:41.687
I don't know.
I say a lot of important things.

18:41.689 --> 18:44.022
That's why Nixon
recorded everything.

18:44.024 --> 18:47.191
You said this wasn't about me,
that it was important to you

18:47.193 --> 18:49.359
and I was just sent down here
to help.

18:49.361 --> 18:51.561
Sounds like somebody else
we know.

everybody but me screwed up.

19:15.046 --> 19:16.512
Well, that is so nice,

19:16.514 --> 19:18.547
but Ryan already fixed
the Nativity scene.

19:18.549 --> 19:21.516
See that?
Ryan admitted he made a mistake.

19:21.518 --> 19:22.717
I think it calls
for a toast.

19:22.719 --> 19:25.186
Eve,
break out the cough syrup.

19:25.188 --> 19:27.387

We're a hit!
