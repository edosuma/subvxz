Hey, can I ask
you a question?

00:38.538 --> 00:42.307
Uh... sure.

00:42.342 --> 00:44.743
Do my hands look like
they're different sizes to you?

00:48.615 --> 00:49.781
I don't know.

00:49.816 --> 00:51.083
No, see, look, when
I put 'em together

00:51.118 --> 00:52.484
like this,
like, it's clear

00:52.519 --> 00:55.120
one is slightly larger
than the other, right?

00:55.155 --> 00:56.655
I really don't know.

00:56.690 --> 00:59.191
Am I crazy or does everyone
have differently shaped hands

00:59.226 --> 01:00.358
and I've never noticed?

01:00.393 --> 01:01.760
(chuckles)
What about you?

01:01.795 --> 01:03.162
Um...

01:04.264 --> 01:06.231
I guess I've never
really thought about it.

01:06.266 --> 01:08.700
(chuckles): Well, I think
you should think about it.

01:08.735 --> 01:09.868
Yeah, look, this one

01:09.903 --> 01:12.771
is definitely larger
than this one.

01:12.806 --> 01:14.673
Really?
- Yeah.

01:14.708 --> 01:15.807
It's probably because
you favor it when you're,

01:15.842 --> 01:17.676
you know, like, writing

01:17.711 --> 01:20.212

opening doors and stuff.

01:20.247 --> 01:21.146
Speaking of which,
what are you having?

I need a drink before

Vodka tonic.

01:26.820 --> 01:27.820

05:56.122 --> 05:57.655
You told Melissa

05:57.690 --> 05:59.391
we need to hang out as a group,
didn't you?

05:59.426 --> 06:01.860
Yeah. But I
didn't mean it.

06:01.895 --> 06:03.628
That is what you say
to your girlfriend

06:03.663 --> 06:05.997
when you don't want her to think
you're an antisocial weirdo.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.632
You are an antisocial weirdo.

06:07.667 --> 06:08.833
That's the whole point.

06:08.868 --> 06:11.035
I don't want her thinking that.

06:11.070 --> 06:12.837
Okay. No, smart move.

06:12.872 --> 06:14.439
Hide your true self
from your girlfriend.

06:14.474 --> 06:16.541
I'm sure that's gonna be great
for your relationship.

06:17.577 --> 06:19.811
This is a disaster.

06:19.846 --> 06:21.479
Are you crazy? Look at us.

06:21.514 --> 06:23.481
We got baller suites,
killer views.

06:23.516 --> 06:25.817
We're drinking beer at 10:00
in the morning. It's awesome.

06:25.852 --> 06:28.086
First of all, don't say "baller"
ever again in your life.

06:28.121 --> 06:29.554
Why?
- Just trust me. That's why.

06:29.589 --> 06:31.489
Don't say it. Okay?
That's number one.

06:31.524 --> 06:35.693
Number two, I am,
uh, supposed to be

06:35.728 --> 06:37.562
romantic this
weekend with her.

06:37.597 --> 06:39.197
You're-you're aware
of that, right?

06:39.232 --> 06:40.665
So what's the problem?

06:40.700 --> 06:41.866
The problem

06:41.901 --> 06:44.669
is that you are here, and
I do not need you judging me.

06:44.704 --> 06:46.871
I don't need your judgy eyes,
your judgy face,

06:46.906 --> 06:48.573
your judgy everything. I don't
need that while I'm trying

06:48.608 --> 06:50.208
to be romantic, you understand?

06:50.243 --> 06:53.211
First of all,
I'm very aware of your issues,

06:53.246 --> 06:55.480
of your intimacy issues,
and-and the last thing

06:55.515 --> 06:57.982
I would want to do
is make you feel uncomfortable.

06:58.017 --> 06:59.117
Uh-huh.
- Here's what we're gonna do.

06:59.152 --> 07:01.653
If at any stage my presence

07:01.688 --> 07:03.121
makes you feel uncomfortable,
makes you feel

07:03.156 --> 07:04.856
like you can't quite get to

07:04.891 --> 07:07.125
the romantic, intimate place
you need to get to,

07:07.160 --> 07:09.161
you say the word, I'm out.

07:10.797 --> 07:12.764
Uh-huh.
- All right?

07:12.799 --> 07:14.666
Like a safe word?

07:14.701 --> 07:16.234
Yeah.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.102
Ah.

07:18.137 --> 07:20.605
I say the word, whatever it is,
and you, uh...

07:20.640 --> 07:21.739
I leave.

07:21.774 --> 07:23.041
Okay.

07:23.076 --> 07:25.677
What's the,
what's the safe word, then?

07:27.714 --> 07:29.848
Uh, "chicken salad."

07:29.883 --> 07:32.050
"Chicken salad."
Yeah.

07:32.085 --> 07:33.918
"Chicken salad." Okay.

07:33.953 --> 07:36.821
Well, yeah, I'll just figure out
a way to casually slide

07:36.856 --> 07:39.190
"chicken salad"
into a normal human sentence.

07:39.225 --> 07:40.992
Organically.
Organically.

07:41.027 --> 07:42.527
Weave it in.
- Yeah.

07:42.562 --> 07:44.563
(phone ringing)

07:46.299 --> 07:47.799
Chin.

07:47.834 --> 07:49.100

07:49.135 --> 07:50.835
Also, happy Valentine's Day.

07:50.870 --> 07:52.237
How's the hotel?

07:52.272 --> 07:54.973
Well, it's crowded.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.274

07:56.309 --> 07:58.109
in on the surprise?
Oh, yeah.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.178
In fact, Lou and I have a bet
on which one of you's

08:00.213 --> 08:02.247
gonna check out first.
Oh, yeah?

08:02.282 --> 08:04.249
Hey, you need help
with the case? We can, uh--

08:04.284 --> 08:05.683
I'll get out of here right now.

08:05.718 --> 08:07.285
No, no, no. Don't be silly.
Enjoy yourself.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.286
We got it covered.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.954
Tell him. Tell him ten
minutes we can be there.

08:09.989 --> 08:11.155
We're not doing
nothing. Go ahead.

08:11.190 --> 08:13.224
They're good. All right, listen,
enjoy your Valentine's Day.

08:13.259 --> 08:14.025
Keep us posted on what happens.

08:14.060 --> 08:16.194
And, uh, you know,
hope you get home

08:16.229 --> 08:18.530
to spend some time with Abby
for Valentine's.

08:18.565 --> 08:20.131
Yeah, you and me both.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.733
All right, have fun.

08:21.768 --> 08:23.701
All right,
so this is what we have.

08:23.736 --> 08:25.270
32-year-old Jeremy Holden,

08:25.305 --> 08:27.238
software developer
from Palo Alto.

08:27.273 --> 08:29.240
His body was discovered
in a Dumpster

08:29.275 --> 08:31.576
behind Vortex Nightclub
in Waikiki this morning.

08:31.611 --> 08:32.911
He's definitely dressed
for a night out.

08:32.946 --> 08:33.912
Mm-hmm.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.947
Also, check this out.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.884
What is that, lipstick?

08:39.919 --> 08:41.686
Looks like our vic
got lucky.

08:41.721 --> 08:43.588
Yeah, luck ran out
pretty quick, though.

08:43.623 --> 08:45.924
His watch and his wallet
were taken off his body.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.926
We think that lipstick
may belong to the killer.

08:47.961 --> 08:49.193
All right,
so she hooks up

08:49.228 --> 08:50.728
with him inside,
lures him outside,

08:50.763 --> 08:52.230
and then robs and shoots him.

08:52.265 --> 08:53.231
KONO:
Exactly.

08:53.266 --> 08:56.267
And then there's this.

08:56.302 --> 08:58.102
Found it in his jacket pocket.

08:58.137 --> 09:00.305
It looks like Holden
was in town for a conference

09:00.340 --> 09:02.574
called the Method;
it's one of these courses

09:02.609 --> 09:04.208
where men discuss
these ridiculous techniques

09:04.243 --> 09:05.342
how to pick up women.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.579
All right, Lou, why don't you
head down to that club,

09:07.614 --> 09:08.613
see if you can get
any more information

09:08.648 --> 09:09.881
on that woman Holden was with.

09:09.916 --> 09:11.583
Either she's our perp
or, at the very least,

09:11.618 --> 09:12.584
a witness.

09:12.619 --> 09:13.752
Got it.

09:16.356 --> 09:21.926
BLAKE: You see, gentlemen,
venue is fundamental, right?

09:21.961 --> 09:25.063
When you run your game
on these women,

09:25.098 --> 09:27.865
you got to own the place.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.034
You want to feel native.

09:30.069 --> 09:35.707
You are the lion
prowling his savanna.

09:35.742 --> 09:38.710
What you don't do

09:38.745 --> 09:41.646
is stand there like a vegetable.

09:41.681 --> 09:42.914
(dopily):
"Uh, I don't know.

09:42.949 --> 09:44.649
"I don't know what I'm doing.

09:44.684 --> 09:45.783
I hope I meet
somebody tonight."

09:45.818 --> 09:48.052
No way.

09:48.087 --> 09:50.989
You engage that crowd, right?

09:51.024 --> 09:53.324
You cheers people.
"Hey, what's up, man?

09:53.359 --> 09:54.792
Cheers! All right!"

09:54.827 --> 09:56.127
You get some fist bumps

09:56.162 --> 09:57.362
going with this guy.

09:57.397 --> 09:58.830
My best friend.

09:58.865 --> 10:00.264
(chuckles):
I don't know that guy.

10:00.299 --> 10:02.266
You laugh at this guy's joke.

10:02.301 --> 10:03.768
(laughs)

10:03.803 --> 10:06.638
He didn't even tell a joke!

10:06.673 --> 10:07.939
It doesn't matter.

10:07.974 --> 10:10.074
You want to seem like the life

10:10.109 --> 10:10.975
of the party.

10:11.010 --> 10:12.810
But never forget
your primary objective,

10:12.845 --> 10:14.345
gentlemen:

10:14.380 --> 10:16.247
that woman.

10:16.282 --> 10:18.916
Because you never know
when your target

10:18.951 --> 10:22.253
is gonna walk
through that door.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.155
And that's your target.

10:26.159 --> 10:28.660
Case in point.

10:28.695 --> 10:30.395
Can I help you?

10:33.299 --> 10:34.999
Blake Stone?

10:35.034 --> 10:37.869
Oh, man.

10:37.904 --> 10:39.771
Jeremy was a solid
dude, you know?

10:39.806 --> 10:41.339
He'd really grown.

10:41.374 --> 10:44.442
He responded to the course
material really well.

10:44.477 --> 10:47.912
See, a lot of people think this
is just about sex, but it's not.

10:47.947 --> 10:50.815
What I do is help people
feel better about themselves.

10:50.850 --> 10:52.450
You mean<i> men</i>

10:52.485 --> 10:55.086
feel better about themselves
by objectifying women.

10:55.121 --> 10:57.422
Now what was that
you called them? Targets.

10:57.457 --> 11:00.725
Look, nobody respects
women more than me.

11:02.428 --> 11:03.695
Right.

11:03.730 --> 11:04.996
So I'm gonna
go ahead and assume

11:05.031 --> 11:07.098
that you were with Jeremy
at the club last night?

11:07.133 --> 11:08.232
That's right, yeah.

11:08.268 --> 11:11.235
We'd gone on a little field trip
to practice our sarging.

11:11.270 --> 11:13.404
"Sarging"?

11:13.439 --> 11:15.473
You know, socializing
with the intent

11:15.508 --> 11:17.776
of finding
and seducing a woman.

11:19.812 --> 11:21.879
Right.

11:21.914 --> 11:23.448
BLAKE:
<i>It was rough for Jeremy.</i>

11:23.483 --> 11:25.383
<i>Everybody wobbles</i>
<i>a little a bit</i>

11:25.418 --> 11:27.418
<i>when you take</i>
<i>the training wheels off.</i>

11:27.453 --> 11:29.220
<i>Don't lose faith.</i>

11:29.255 --> 11:31.322
<i>Trust the process.</i>

11:32.825 --> 11:34.425
Now, what's the golden rule
of The Method?

11:34.460 --> 11:36.828
Stop caring what
women think about you.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.062
Yes!

11:38.097 --> 11:39.196
Exactly.

11:39.232 --> 11:43.902
Rejection is just a step
along the path to scoring a ten.

11:46.472 --> 11:48.339
Now, check it out.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.942
All alone at the bar,
red dress.

11:50.977 --> 11:54.179
She's yours
for the taking, brother.

11:56.182 --> 11:57.782
Wish me luck.
- No.

11:57.817 --> 12:00.284
You don't need luck.

12:00.319 --> 12:02.220
You got The Method.

12:08.461 --> 12:10.161
But the kid did good.

12:10.196 --> 12:13.164
20 minutes later, Jeremy had
run his game on this girl,

12:13.199 --> 12:15.533
and he was leaving the club
with her.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.468
And I take it
you don't know her name.

12:17.503 --> 12:19.470
Nah, of course not.
Of course not.

12:19.505 --> 12:21.506
But I'll tell you this.

12:21.541 --> 12:22.607
When Jeremy left that place,

12:22.642 --> 12:25.143
he looked like the happiest dude
in the whole world.

12:25.178 --> 12:27.078
KONO: Well, I wouldn't be
too proud of yourself,

12:27.113 --> 12:28.179
because shortly thereafter,

12:28.214 --> 12:31.082
he was taken to the back alley,
robbed and murdered.

12:31.117 --> 12:32.517
Which means you may
have introduced him

12:32.552 --> 12:34.185
to his killer.

What are you talking about?

It's a, it's a do-over. We do

14:29.602 --> 14:30.935
Huh?
It's my disk.

14:30.970 --> 14:32.169
Yeah, I know.
Your disk just came

14:32.204 --> 14:33.471
and hit my girlfriend
in the butt.

14:39.178 --> 14:41.612

14:44.250 --> 14:45.616
I'm sorry, miss."

14:48.287 --> 14:49.487
It was an accident.

14:49.522 --> 14:51.956
(winces) Okay.

14:53.159 --> 14:55.326
Huh. All right.
Well, go long.

15:15.381 --> 15:16.414
That was our point.

15:16.449 --> 15:17.615
Trust me, don't agitate him

15:17.650 --> 15:20.251
when he gets upset like this.

15:25.458 --> 15:28.292
Sure, he was here.

15:28.327 --> 15:31.462
Drank vodka tonics,
ran up quite a tab.

15:31.497 --> 15:33.464
And somehow left
with the hottest

15:33.499 --> 15:34.665
<i>girl in the club.</i>

15:34.700 --> 15:38.269
She sat right here most of
the night, drinking for free.

15:38.304 --> 15:39.437
You know, it was
kind of entertaining

15:39.472 --> 15:40.671
watching all these
guys hit on her,

15:40.706 --> 15:43.207
only to flame out
in a few minutes.

15:43.242 --> 15:45.476
So what'd this guy
do different?

15:45.511 --> 15:47.378
Well, for starters,

15:47.413 --> 15:50.114
<i>I can tell you that the watch</i>
<i>on his wrist looked to be worth</i>

15:50.149 --> 15:51.515
<i>ten grand easy.</i>
<i>He flashed a pretty healthy</i>

15:51.550 --> 15:53.985
wad of cash.

15:54.020 --> 15:56.354
Yeah, that'll do it.

15:56.389 --> 15:57.722
So it wasn't
his winning personality

15:57.757 --> 16:00.691
that closed the deal.

16:00.726 --> 16:02.626
Let's just say
I've seen every which way

16:02.661 --> 16:05.396
a guy and a girl
can get together, and, um,

16:05.431 --> 16:08.666
this woman seemed very...
professional.

16:08.701 --> 16:11.502
You trying to say
she's a prostitute?

16:11.537 --> 16:14.372
Well, based on my 15 years
in working places like this,

16:14.407 --> 16:16.440
that would be a yes.

16:16.475 --> 16:19.610
GROVER:<i> So after pulling</i>
<i>all the solicitation</i>

16:19.645 --> 16:21.379
arrest records
over the past 12 months

16:21.414 --> 16:24.248
based on our bartender's
description of the suspect,

16:24.283 --> 16:27.418
I was able to narrow things down
to these lovely ladies.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.688
Okay, was he able to I.D. our girl?
- Yeah.

16:32.124 --> 16:34.058
Vanessa Lancey.

16:34.093 --> 16:37.395
She was caught in an HPD
john sting a few months back.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.630
Well, looks like she wasn't
out of action for too long.

16:39.665 --> 16:42.333
Yeah, HPD went by
the, uh, last known address,

16:42.368 --> 16:44.101
but she doesn't
live there anymore.

16:44.136 --> 16:46.270
Fortunately,
we had another lead.

16:46.305 --> 16:49.673
Cordelia Martin
posted her bail.

16:49.708 --> 16:52.543
Cordelia owns
a high-end escort service

16:52.578 --> 16:53.511
here on the island.

16:53.546 --> 16:56.180
Huh. You know this
through personal experience?

16:56.215 --> 16:57.448
(French accent):
But of course.

16:57.483 --> 16:59.583
(normal voice):
See, when I was with SWAT,

16:59.618 --> 17:02.520
we knocked down her door
on more than one occasion.

17:02.555 --> 17:05.456
Well, then she'll be thrilled
to see you again.

17:08.494 --> 17:10.528
Oh!

17:10.563 --> 17:12.563
Feels good
to cool off, right?

17:12.598 --> 17:14.598
Very nice.
- Yeah.

17:14.633 --> 17:17.068
After a loss like that, it's good to...
- Yeah.

17:17.103 --> 17:18.402
...bring the body
temperature down

17:18.437 --> 17:20.504
with some cool water, right?

17:20.539 --> 17:22.473
You're not gonna let me
live that one down, are you?

17:22.508 --> 17:24.475
No chance.
- Yeah.

17:25.511 --> 17:26.811
It's just winning.

17:26.846 --> 17:28.245
It's something
I like to do, you know?

17:28.280 --> 17:29.547
I know. You like to win.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.582
Like, part of my...
I think it's important from now,

17:31.617 --> 17:34.185
you know, occasionally
for you to get a win.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.454
Yeah, yeah. It's good for
your self-esteem, you know?

17:36.489 --> 17:38.456
Yeah.

17:38.491 --> 17:39.623
Hey, we got to go.

17:39.658 --> 17:41.659
The girls are
waiting at the spa.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.498
What's the matter?

17:49.535 --> 17:51.435
My sunglasses are gone.

17:51.470 --> 17:52.870
You sure?

17:52.905 --> 17:55.573
Yes, I'm sure.

17:55.608 --> 17:57.775
Really?

17:57.810 --> 18:00.578
Look at that kid
with the Frisbee. Again?

18:00.613 --> 18:02.480
Just the balls
on this kid.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.315
Danny. Hey, hey, no.

18:04.350 --> 18:06.150
No. Danny, no!
DANNY: Hey!

18:06.185 --> 18:07.751
Hey, hey, hey,
you with the Frisbee.

18:07.786 --> 18:09.386
Come on, hand 'em over.

18:09.421 --> 18:11.388
What are you
talking about?

18:11.423 --> 18:13.124
The glasses--
they're mine.

18:13.159 --> 18:15.326
Dude, I don't have your
glasses. These are mine.

18:15.361 --> 18:17.128
Yeah.

18:17.163 --> 18:19.396
All right, well, look,
uh, we'll settle this.

18:19.431 --> 18:21.332
Uh, my glasses--
they got a little scratch

18:21.367 --> 18:22.900
on the inside right lens.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.469
Give me those, and, uh,
we'll see what's what, huh?

18:25.504 --> 18:26.737
Help!

18:26.772 --> 18:28.606
Help! Somebody help me!

18:28.641 --> 18:31.208
This man is touching me
inappropriately! Help!

18:31.243 --> 18:32.843
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
You nuts?

18:32.878 --> 18:34.378
I got to ask you a question.

18:34.413 --> 18:35.679
The-the glasses--
were they expensive?

18:35.714 --> 18:38.215
No, 20 bucks at the ABC Store.
- 20 bucks. Oh.

18:38.250 --> 18:39.617
Well, listen, God knows
what the girls spent

18:39.652 --> 18:41.886
on these spa treatments,
so let's not be late.

18:41.921 --> 18:43.287
Let's go up and meet them,

18:43.322 --> 18:45.656
and if after
this relaxing spa experience,

18:45.691 --> 18:48.459
if you're still bothered by
this whole sunglasses situation,

18:48.494 --> 18:51.195
I'll spring for a new pair.
How about that?

18:51.230 --> 18:54.698
Captain Grover, so nice of you
to use the doorbell this time.

18:54.733 --> 18:56.767
Yeah, I missed you,
too, Cordelia.

18:56.802 --> 18:59.637
I'm here to talk to you
about one of your girls.

18:59.672 --> 19:00.838
I'm not sure
where you've got

19:00.873 --> 19:04.242
your information, but I'm not
in that business anymore.

19:05.911 --> 19:07.645
Okay. Come on, Cordelia.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.881
Who you think
you're talking to?

19:10.916 --> 19:12.850
You might've changed
your operation a little bit

19:12.885 --> 19:15.586
and learned to be
more discreet, but, uh,

19:15.621 --> 19:19.223
from the looks of these
fancy bottles and artwork,

19:19.258 --> 19:21.259
I think you're still
in business.

19:22.661 --> 19:23.794
(sighs)

19:23.829 --> 19:27.464
Cordelia, if I was here to
arrest you, I'd have handcuffs.

19:27.499 --> 19:30.201
And not for what
you want 'em for.

19:30.236 --> 19:32.836
So what do you want?
A date for Valentine's?

19:32.871 --> 19:35.206
Oh, that's funny.

19:35.241 --> 19:37.308
No.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.910
I want to talk to you
about this girl.

19:39.945 --> 19:42.780
She may be involved
in a murder.

19:46.252 --> 19:48.219
(sighs)

19:48.254 --> 19:50.454
It's Valentine's Day, Cordelia.
Damn!

19:50.489 --> 19:52.323
I'm trying to get home
to my wife

19:52.358 --> 19:54.225
to give her the Valentine's Day
she deserves.

19:54.260 --> 19:56.527
Would you stop playing
and help me out, please?

19:56.562 --> 19:58.629
Her name is Vanessa.

19:58.664 --> 20:01.899
And regrettably,
she's no longer in my employ.

20:01.934 --> 20:04.802
Why? What happened?

20:04.837 --> 20:06.270
She was my best girl.

20:06.305 --> 20:08.706
(sighs) Always in demand,
that one.

20:08.741 --> 20:11.442
But about a month ago,
she decided

20:11.477 --> 20:14.411
she could make more money
with someone else, so she left.

20:14.446 --> 20:17.982
Oh, that's too bad.

20:18.017 --> 20:21.619
So, do you happen to know who
she might be in business with?

BLAKE: All right, Richard,
let me ask you a question.

20:41.307 --> 20:42.773
Do you have ten
million dollars?

20:42.808 --> 20:44.508
RICHARD:
No.

20:44.543 --> 20:46.777
And where do you think you
fall in the looks department,

20:46.812 --> 20:48.612
on a scale of one to ten?

20:48.647 --> 20:50.281
Six.
- Four.

20:50.316 --> 20:51.715
Okay, let's
call it a five.

20:51.750 --> 20:52.850
But me, too.

20:52.885 --> 20:54.418
My point is this.

20:54.453 --> 20:57.655
Guys like us-- if we're
gonna score a ten,

20:57.690 --> 21:00.424
we got to bring it
in other areas, right?

21:00.459 --> 21:01.925
So here's what I
want you to do.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.861
I want you to think
of the funniest thing

21:03.896 --> 21:06.597
that's ever happened to you,
and play that scenario

21:06.632 --> 21:09.833
over in your mind as you
walk over to that chick

21:09.868 --> 21:11.502
in the yellow bikini
right there.

21:11.537 --> 21:12.803
And she's gonna
see you coming, bro,

21:12.838 --> 21:14.872
with that smile
on your face,

21:14.907 --> 21:17.074
and she's gonna think,
"Hey, that guy--

21:17.109 --> 21:19.043
"he's got great energy.

21:19.078 --> 21:21.045
"He's happy,
he's confident.

21:21.080 --> 21:23.381
I want that."

21:43.802 --> 21:45.369

21:45.404 --> 21:47.705
Oh, I was hoping
I'd see you again.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.106
Same here.

21:49.141 --> 21:50.708
Hey, I like where
this is going.

21:50.743 --> 21:52.609
Hands behind your back.
What?

21:52.644 --> 21:53.777
Whoa. What's going on?

21:53.812 --> 21:55.012
See, we figured out
how you've managed

21:55.047 --> 21:57.681
to guarantee success
for your clients.

21:57.716 --> 21:59.917
You've been paying escorts
to hook up with them.

22:00.953 --> 22:02.953
Is that a crime?

22:02.988 --> 22:05.089
Oh, yeah. Very much so.

22:05.124 --> 22:06.757
It's called
solicitation.

22:06.792 --> 22:08.726
With a bit of good old-fashioned
fraud thrown in. Let's go.

22:16.068 --> 22:18.069
(gentle music playing)

22:19.805 --> 22:23.006
Pretty relaxing getting pampered
like this, Danny, huh?

22:23.041 --> 22:24.108
Yeah, it's amazing.

22:24.143 --> 22:25.809
It's relaxing.

22:25.844 --> 22:26.844
(sighs)

22:26.879 --> 22:28.011
(clears throat)

22:28.046 --> 22:29.547
Mmm.

22:33.886 --> 22:36.087
(clears throat)

22:39.158 --> 22:41.125
Excuse me,

22:41.160 --> 22:45.529
uh, spa lady, is there jasmine
in this product?

22:45.564 --> 22:47.531
Hon, you're ruining my Zen.

22:47.566 --> 22:48.999
MELISSA:
The narration--

22:49.034 --> 22:50.067
it has to stop.

22:50.102 --> 22:51.836
STEVE:
Okay, sorry.

22:56.141 --> 22:58.909
Sorry, sorry. One last question,
guys. Excuse me.

22:58.944 --> 22:59.943
Is this good
for crow's-feet?

22:59.978 --> 23:01.712
'Cause I noticed some lines...

23:01.747 --> 23:02.880
Babe, zip it, seriously.

23:09.555 --> 23:11.121
Okay, you know what.

23:11.156 --> 23:13.123
I'm done.

23:13.158 --> 23:14.091
I can't deal with it.

23:14.126 --> 23:15.893
Can you just...

23:15.928 --> 23:18.061
Uh, uh, babe,
I'll see you in a little bit.

23:18.096 --> 23:20.063
I'll catch up
with you guys later.

23:20.098 --> 23:23.167
Where is he going?

23:23.202 --> 23:26.036
DANNY: Look, I-I know we got off
on the wrong foot, okay?

23:26.071 --> 23:28.172
And I, um...
I apologize for my part.

23:28.207 --> 23:30.441
I didn't mean to throw
the Frisbee in the water,

23:30.476 --> 23:32.109
and I'm sorry about
the incident on the beach.

23:32.144 --> 23:36.113
Um, I think we should just
wash our hands, start fresh.

23:36.148 --> 23:37.781
Just give me back
the sunglasses.

23:37.816 --> 23:39.950
Dude, I do not have
your sunglasses!

23:39.985 --> 23:41.885
But here, take my towel.

23:41.920 --> 23:44.221
You can use it to wipe
that disgusting crap

23:44.256 --> 23:46.223
off your ugly face.
Thank you.

23:46.258 --> 23:49.960
(boys laughing)
Thank you. Thank you.

23:54.233 --> 23:58.035
KONO: You know, I have to admit,
I'm pretty impressed.

23:58.070 --> 24:00.704
You know, besides being
a misogynistic scam artist,

24:00.739 --> 24:02.105
obstructing
a murder investigation,

24:02.140 --> 24:04.842
that's just a whole other level
of douchebaggery.

24:04.877 --> 24:05.676
You really
should've told us

24:05.711 --> 24:08.245
about your connection
to Vanessa.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.614
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

24:10.649 --> 24:12.249
It's a trade secret.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.551
I was protecting my business.

24:14.586 --> 24:18.155
Before we judge, can
we just talk about

24:18.190 --> 24:20.924
the people
that I'm helping, okay?

24:20.959 --> 24:24.895
These are really lonely men
with tragically low self-esteem.

24:24.930 --> 24:29.166
And The Method gives them the
self-confidence that they need,

24:29.201 --> 24:32.236
you know, often for the first
time in their whole lives.

24:32.271 --> 24:33.737
You done?

24:33.772 --> 24:35.239
Yeah.
- Good.

24:35.274 --> 24:36.540
'Cause this is what I think.

24:36.575 --> 24:37.875
The stuff you teach these guys

24:37.910 --> 24:39.576
doesn't work-- it never did.

24:39.611 --> 24:41.712
That's why you rely on girls
like Vanessa to help

24:41.747 --> 24:44.248
from exposing what
you really are, a con artist.

24:44.283 --> 24:47.117
Yeah, she's
got a point.

24:47.152 --> 24:49.620
You're really nothing more
than a glorified pimp.

24:49.655 --> 24:51.154
You take desperate,
vulnerable men,

24:51.189 --> 24:53.156
and then you hook them up
with prostitutes.

24:53.191 --> 24:55.292
Sooner or later,
this was bound to happen.

24:55.327 --> 24:58.228
BLAKE: Look, I know
how this looks, okay?

24:58.263 --> 25:01.231
But Vanessa's no thief, and
she's definitely not a murderer.

25:01.266 --> 25:03.534
KONO:
Maybe. Maybe not.

25:03.569 --> 25:06.703
She was the last person seen
with Jeremy before he died.

25:06.738 --> 25:09.840
So if she's not involved,
where is she?

25:09.875 --> 25:10.674
I don't know.

25:10.709 --> 25:12.276
I tried calling her
this morning,

25:12.311 --> 25:14.011
but it just went to voice mail.

25:14.046 --> 25:15.946
You know where she lives?
- Yeah.

25:15.981 --> 25:18.148
I've been by there
to drop off money.

25:18.183 --> 25:21.552
Great. Then it looks like
we're all going for a drive.

25:27.726 --> 25:29.693
LYNN:
How you doing there?

25:29.728 --> 25:32.963
Good. Fine.

25:32.998 --> 25:34.665
Really?
- (grunts): Yeah.

25:34.700 --> 25:36.867
Sure about that?

25:36.902 --> 25:39.069
Yeah.
- (chuckles)

25:39.104 --> 25:41.138
(whispers):
See I'm smiling?

25:41.173 --> 25:42.639
Seems like
you're struggling a bit.

25:42.674 --> 25:43.907
I'm not struggling.

25:43.942 --> 25:44.708
It's awesome.

25:46.278 --> 25:48.979
Maybe we should
switch up the teams.

25:49.014 --> 25:50.047
(grunts)

25:50.082 --> 25:51.181
There's not...

25:51.216 --> 25:54.885
there's no teams in yoga, Lynn.

25:54.920 --> 25:57.955
Ah. Okay.

25:57.990 --> 26:00.223
Yeah, I understand
what just happened.

26:00.258 --> 26:02.359
I just see what you did there.

26:02.394 --> 26:04.227
You were referring to the, uh,

26:04.262 --> 26:06.330
comment I made
on the volleyball court.

26:06.365 --> 26:10.300
I didn't mean to, I didn't
mean to upset anybody.

26:10.335 --> 26:13.303
At least your
boyfriend's here.

26:13.338 --> 26:15.772
(chuckles)

26:15.807 --> 26:18.242
(straining): I don't think
I can hold this.

26:22.414 --> 26:23.780
(mutters)

26:23.815 --> 26:26.584
Okay, you know something,
I'm gonna go.

26:27.986 --> 26:30.287
I'm gonna go check on Danny.
Seems like a good idea.

26:30.322 --> 26:32.155
Your concern for him must be

26:32.190 --> 26:34.691
affecting your concentration
and balance.

26:34.726 --> 26:36.727
(Melissa and Lynn laughing)

26:43.335 --> 26:46.837
Excuse me. Officer Kalakaua,
can I ask you a question?

26:46.872 --> 26:49.106
Do you believe that
there's a thin line

26:49.141 --> 26:51.108
between love and hate?

26:51.143 --> 26:53.010
Because the way that you were
laying into me back there,

26:53.045 --> 26:53.911
that was so over the top,

26:53.946 --> 26:57.982
I was like,
"Wow, maybe she likes me."

26:59.317 --> 27:01.318
I don't.

27:01.353 --> 27:04.855
Fair enough.
Fair enough.

27:04.890 --> 27:07.424
Hey, just so you know,
I go for more of

27:07.459 --> 27:10.293
the uninhibited,
free-spirited types.

27:10.328 --> 27:12.729
Ah. (chuckles)

27:12.764 --> 27:14.264
Yeah, I know
what you're doing.

27:14.299 --> 27:18.235
It's called
negging. Right?

27:18.270 --> 27:20.771
Yeah, you're betting that my
self-confidence is so fragile

27:20.806 --> 27:23.373
that I actually care about
what you think of me.

27:23.408 --> 27:26.743
You prey on women's insecurities
and vulnerabilities,

27:26.778 --> 27:28.779
and then you
exploit that.

27:30.782 --> 27:33.083
Wow, Blake.

27:33.118 --> 27:34.751
That didn't go so well.

27:34.786 --> 27:39.089
Actually, I'm super turned-on
right now.

27:39.124 --> 27:40.390
Oh, heads up.

27:40.425 --> 27:44.161
It's the second building
on the left up there.

27:59.344 --> 28:01.311
And they say chivalry is dead.

28:01.346 --> 28:02.746
Not so fast.

28:02.781 --> 28:04.247
What the...

28:04.282 --> 28:06.450
Oh, come on.

28:06.485 --> 28:08.719
Really?

28:08.754 --> 28:10.287
We'll crack a window for you.

28:10.322 --> 28:12.055
AIKANE:<i> Vanessa didn't</i>
<i>come home last night,</i>

28:12.090 --> 28:14.991
which isn't unusual.

28:15.026 --> 28:17.327
But when the afternoon
rolled around

28:17.362 --> 28:20.464
and I still hadn't heard
from her, I got worried.

28:20.499 --> 28:22.065
Okay, how long
has she lived here?

28:22.100 --> 28:24.735
Only a couple
weeks or so.

28:24.770 --> 28:27.170
She had this client who
was obsessed with her.

28:27.205 --> 28:28.939
The guy wouldn't take
no for an answer,

28:28.974 --> 28:30.974
and Vanessa didn't feel safe
at her house anymore.

28:31.009 --> 28:32.509
CHIN:
This client--

28:32.544 --> 28:34.411
was he someone she met
through that pickup seminar?

28:34.446 --> 28:37.448
Yeah. But Vanessa never
mentioned his name.

28:38.884 --> 28:41.418
VANESSA:
<i>Neil, listen to me.</i>

28:41.453 --> 28:44.254
You are not
a bad person.

28:44.289 --> 28:46.123
You didn't mean
to kill that guy.

28:46.158 --> 28:48.792
Things just got out of control.

28:48.827 --> 28:50.460
And that's what I'll tell
the police.

28:50.495 --> 28:52.462
No, no, there's not
gonna be any police.

28:52.497 --> 28:55.198
We're just gonna wait here
until everything dies down.

28:55.233 --> 28:56.399
Then I'm gonna get us
a couple of tickets

28:56.434 --> 28:57.768
and we can get out of here.

28:57.803 --> 28:59.169
Neil, this isn't going to work!

28:59.204 --> 29:00.470
Don't say that! You need
to do the right thing now.

29:00.505 --> 29:01.772
Don't tell me what I have to do!

29:01.807 --> 29:03.507
God!

29:03.542 --> 29:04.842
(grunting)
(shrieks)

29:06.311 --> 29:07.978
(panting)

29:09.014 --> 29:11.481
It's okay.

29:11.516 --> 29:12.883
It's okay, it's okay.

29:12.918 --> 29:15.552
I'm sorry. Uh...

29:15.587 --> 29:18.889
We're both upset right now.

29:18.924 --> 29:20.390
Hey.

29:20.425 --> 29:23.026
This long-distance thing

29:23.061 --> 29:24.861
was never gonna work.

29:24.896 --> 29:27.531
You just needed to see me.

29:27.566 --> 29:29.900
I promise...

29:31.603 --> 29:34.805
...everything will be okay
from now on.

29:41.980 --> 29:43.046
What are you doing?

29:43.081 --> 29:46.283
Sit down.
Sit down, please.

29:46.318 --> 29:48.185
What am I doing?

29:48.220 --> 29:49.886
What are you doing?

29:49.921 --> 29:51.054
I'm doing a little recon.

29:51.089 --> 29:52.455
Recon.

29:52.490 --> 29:54.491
(talking quietly)

29:56.228 --> 29:58.328
Can I ask you a question?

29:58.363 --> 30:00.397
Uh-huh.
- What-what recon?

30:00.432 --> 30:01.998
He doesn't have
the glasses with him.

30:02.033 --> 30:04.201
I know that. I know
where he put the glasses.

30:04.236 --> 30:05.936
He thinks he outsmarted
me, but he didn't.

30:05.971 --> 30:07.404
I know where
the glasses are.

30:07.439 --> 30:10.340
Okay. Something
you should know--

30:10.375 --> 30:13.009
I think it's important
I tell you-- you have

30:13.044 --> 30:14.578
completely separated
from reality right now,

30:14.613 --> 30:16.580
all over a pair of $20 glasses.
You understand that?

30:16.615 --> 30:18.481
It's not about the money.
It's not about the money?

30:18.516 --> 30:19.482
No, it's the principle.

30:19.517 --> 30:21.418
You mean pettiness, huh?

30:21.453 --> 30:23.287
(boys chuckling)

30:25.323 --> 30:26.322
(sighs)

30:26.358 --> 30:28.425
I think we should,
I think we should talk about...

30:28.460 --> 30:29.860
Shut up, please, okay?

30:29.895 --> 30:31.561
I'm going in. Just relax.

30:31.596 --> 30:33.630
What do you mean, going i-in?

30:33.665 --> 30:35.432
Where, what's, where-- In where?

30:35.467 --> 30:37.301
Hey, hey, hey.

30:45.176 --> 30:46.943
1204. I got it.

30:46.978 --> 30:47.944
No, no, no, no.

30:47.979 --> 30:49.446
No. No.

30:49.481 --> 30:52.115
Come on. I'm gonna go with
or without you. I'm going.

30:52.150 --> 30:53.350
I'm not-- Well, without me.

30:53.385 --> 30:55.452
All right. Stay there.
Yeah, I will.

30:58.156 --> 31:00.157
Damn it.

31:05.163 --> 31:07.564
CHIN:
Neil Ware.

31:07.599 --> 31:09.132
43 years old.

31:09.167 --> 31:11.368
Flew in from Dayton,
Ohio, a few weeks ago.

31:11.403 --> 31:13.036
Looks like he's still here.

31:13.071 --> 31:14.537
GROVER:
Okay, Blake,

31:14.572 --> 31:17.240
you recognize this guy or what?

31:17.275 --> 31:19.209
Yeah, I remember him.

31:19.244 --> 31:21.378
Yeah, for sure. He came
to me a couple months back.

31:21.413 --> 31:23.914
He'd just been dumped
by his fiancée, right?

31:23.949 --> 31:26.082
Guy was a real mess.

31:26.117 --> 31:28.919
Like, crushed.

31:28.954 --> 31:31.221
I gave him a TCB.

31:31.256 --> 31:33.223
Total Confidence
Rebuild.

31:33.258 --> 31:34.691
Well, it looks like
this ex-fiancée

31:34.726 --> 31:37.560
filed a restraining order
against him.

31:37.595 --> 31:41.398
So this guy has a history of
not taking no for an answer.

31:41.433 --> 31:42.966
So let me guess.

31:43.001 --> 31:46.003
What'd you do,
hook this guy up with Vanessa?

31:47.038 --> 31:48.271
Yeah.

31:48.306 --> 31:49.506
Okay, so I got
a credit card charge

31:49.541 --> 31:51.141
on a vacation rental service.

31:51.176 --> 31:52.409
Make the call.

31:52.444 --> 31:54.478
We need an address,
and we need it fast.

31:56.348 --> 31:59.516
You say that you love me, Neil.

31:59.551 --> 32:03.086
And if you do, you
need to let me go.

32:03.121 --> 32:05.088
You don't really want that.

32:05.123 --> 32:08.091
You're just saying it
because you're scared, but, hey,

32:08.126 --> 32:09.726
remember what it was like
when we met?

32:09.761 --> 32:13.063
It can be like that again.

32:19.170 --> 32:21.471
I need to tell you something.

32:21.506 --> 32:23.306
What?

32:23.341 --> 32:24.474
That night

32:24.509 --> 32:27.510
when we met at the bar...

32:27.545 --> 32:30.113
Blake paid me to be there.

32:31.549 --> 32:33.416
What do you mean?

32:33.451 --> 32:35.418
He paid me

32:35.453 --> 32:37.721
to talk to you and
to flirt with you.

32:39.424 --> 32:41.591
Y-You're lying.

32:41.626 --> 32:43.560
I am sorry.

32:43.595 --> 32:46.430
I am so sorry.

32:48.433 --> 32:51.634
I'm not who
you think I am.

32:51.669 --> 32:53.971
For me, this was
just about the money.

32:55.774 --> 32:58.308
I loved you.

32:58.343 --> 32:59.709
And you... you...

32:59.744 --> 33:02.412
you and Blake, you used me.

33:02.447 --> 33:04.514
And I bet you both
laughed about it all, huh?

33:04.549 --> 33:06.583
(crying):
No.

33:06.618 --> 33:08.585
It doesn't matter now.

33:10.588 --> 33:13.156

Excuse me, miss.

Hi. We're, uh, police officers.
Oh, no.

36:12.837 --> 36:13.703
It is, uh, very important

36:13.738 --> 36:15.872

Danny's gonna buy you guys
dinner tonight. Yeah.

37:17.902 --> 37:20.637
Just wanted to come
by and let you know.

37:20.672 --> 37:21.904
He's gonna pay for it.

37:21.939 --> 37:23.773
Oh, yeah.

Hey.

37:35.053 --> 37:37.387
"Hey"?

37:37.422 --> 37:40.023

line for a master of seduction.

37:40.058 --> 37:42.292
(chuckles softly)

37:42.327 --> 37:44.527
Can I be serious
for a second?

37:44.562 --> 37:46.263
Please. Go ahead.

37:48.466 --> 37:49.799
Thank you.

37:51.369 --> 37:53.369
Okay. Well, don't let it
go to your head.

37:53.404 --> 37:54.804
I was just doing my job.

37:54.839 --> 37:57.340
I'm ready to get serious
about my life.

37:57.375 --> 37:59.909
You know, I want
a committed relationship.

38:02.914 --> 38:05.748
And you seem like someone

38:05.783 --> 38:07.917
I could maybe
go the distance with, Kono.

38:07.952 --> 38:12.322
You are so beautiful.

38:12.357 --> 38:15.825
You're way too beautiful to be
hidden away on this island.

38:15.860 --> 38:19.929
So maybe we could
get together, you know?

38:19.964 --> 38:21.931
Travel the world.

38:21.966 --> 38:23.967
Maybe have kids.

38:26.871 --> 38:29.539
I don't know if you noticed,
I'm married.

38:29.574 --> 38:31.874
But even if I wasn't,

38:31.909 --> 38:34.311
the answer would still be no.

38:36.781 --> 38:39.048
That ring is not necessarily
a deal breaker.

38:39.083 --> 38:40.950
Take care of
yourself, Blake.

38:54.932 --> 38:57.033

Don't move.

they turn up somewhere.

41:23.047 --> 41:25.048
Yeah.

41:27.685 --> 41:29.118
MELISSA:
Well, thank you, boys.

41:29.153 --> 41:30.620
This is
a very nice gesture.

41:30.655 --> 41:31.854
STEVE:
Well, actually,

41:31.889 --> 41:33.890
this whole thing
was Danny's idea.

41:37.228 --> 41:39.896
Um, I-I want
to apologize...

41:39.931 --> 41:42.899
for, uh, being a little
distant this afternoon.

41:42.934 --> 41:44.534
Uh...

41:44.569 --> 41:47.604
And I want to tell you
that you, um...

41:51.309 --> 41:54.110
I want to let
you know, um...

41:54.145 --> 41:55.711
You know,
I can feel you.

41:55.746 --> 41:57.013
It's like you're
on my face.

41:57.048 --> 41:58.314
I can-- it's-it's
like you're judge-y.

41:58.349 --> 41:59.849
You're judging me and I can...
- What? No.

41:59.884 --> 42:01.083
It's, like, right
here, okay? It's...

42:01.118 --> 42:02.919
No, I got you,
I got you, I got you.

42:02.954 --> 42:05.154
DANNY: You got what?
STEVE: I got you. Listen.

42:05.189 --> 42:06.956
What Danny is
trying to say,

42:06.991 --> 42:09.825
is that we wanted
to show you guys

42:09.860 --> 42:11.861
how much
we appreciate you both,

42:11.896 --> 42:14.230
so here...
here's to you two.

42:14.265 --> 42:15.631
And thank you.
Thank you.

42:15.666 --> 42:16.866
How was that?
Thank you.

42:16.901 --> 42:19.269
Okay. All right.
Good job. Good job.

42:22.340 --> 42:25.675
That's very nice.
Good choice, good choice.

42:25.710 --> 42:27.176
This has been fun.

42:27.211 --> 42:29.211
STEVE:
I agree, I agree.

42:29.246 --> 42:30.246
It's been great, right?

42:30.281 --> 42:32.081
I think actually, Melissa,

42:32.116 --> 42:33.316
I think we should do it again.

42:33.351 --> 42:34.784
What do you say?

42:34.819 --> 42:38.120
I'm just saying,
let's do it again.

42:38.155 --> 42:40.256
And Danny and I will,
uh, you know, we can,

42:40.291 --> 42:42.792
we can organize it
next time.

42:48.199 --> 42:50.366
Chicken salad.

42:50.401 --> 42:51.834
You want the chicken salad?

42:51.869 --> 42:53.069
Chicken salad.

42:57.408 --> 42:59.742
Chicken salad.

42:59.777 --> 43:00.743
<i>Chicken salad.</i>
