Over here!

Come on!

02:23.101 --> 02:24.812
Help me.

Get him out.

[speaking Spanish]

02:35.864 --> 02:36.949
Easy, easy, easy.

02:39.201 --> 02:40.994
Okay. Go upstairs...

02:41.078 --> 02:42.705
and close the door.

02:42.788 --> 02:43.789
And not a word to anybody.

02:43.872 --> 02:44.873
[man] Si. Okay.

02:44.957 --> 02:46.499
Not even your mom.

-It's okay. I'm just trying to help.
-No.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.447
-We have to get you to the hospital.
-They'll kill everyone.

04:01.158 --> 04:03.827
-Who?
-The men who did this.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.371
They'll kill everyone in the hospital
to get to me.

-[groaning]
-Okay, you can't--

04:08.331 --> 04:11.168
Don't. You've lost a lot of blood.
I think you might have been stabbed.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.836
I have to leave.

04:16.840 --> 04:18.050
You wanna leave?
Door's that way.

This crowd is not happy, Pete.

04:28.435 --> 04:33.690
Murdock has dominated this fight
but now Price has turned the table on him.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.400
He's pounding Murdock's head

04:35.483 --> 04:37.735
-and Murdock isn't even defending himself.
-[commentator 2] Oh! Oh!

04:37.820 --> 04:40.072

Price looks as shocked as the crowd.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.040
Murdock had him on the ropes

but let his glove drop and got tagged

don't get blood on your shirt.

05:46.096 --> 05:47.555
[Jack breathing heavily]

05:47.639 --> 05:49.182
[Matt] Gotta keep your gloves up.

05:49.266 --> 05:52.352
Yeah, well, I... I should
have you in my corner.

05:53.770 --> 05:56.356
-Does it hurt?
-[sighs]

05:56.439 --> 05:58.191
It don't tickle.

05:58.275 --> 05:59.859
Go get the kit.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.033
[Matt] You shoulda had him.

06:06.116 --> 06:07.575
[scoffs] Price is a bum.

06:07.659 --> 06:10.870
Hey, anybody who's got the guts
to step into that ring deserves respect.

06:10.954 --> 06:11.955
Don't you ever forget that.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.457
-Even Price?
-Even Price.

06:15.458 --> 06:18.003
-Sorry you lost, Dad.
-Yeah...

06:18.086 --> 06:19.296
Just wasn't my night.

06:20.213 --> 06:23.133
Easy, easy, easy.
Easy with the cotton swabs there, doc.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.884
Gotta get in there.

06:24.968 --> 06:27.387
You don't want to get it infected.

06:27.470 --> 06:30.140
-Stitches?
-Oh, yeah.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.060
You better get the Scotch.

06:40.108 --> 06:41.151
No.

06:42.610 --> 06:44.446
-It's for you.
-[chuckles lightly] Really?

06:44.529 --> 06:46.906
You think I want your hands shaking
like last time?

06:47.824 --> 06:50.077
This is my face we're talking about.

06:51.744 --> 06:52.787
Go ahead.

06:52.870 --> 06:54.539
Take a--
Just a little sip.

06:59.127 --> 07:00.462
-[chuckles]
-Oh!

07:00.545 --> 07:02.714
Oh, it burns!

07:03.631 --> 07:05.550
All right. [clears throat]
Come on.

07:07.052 --> 07:08.886
Let's do it.

07:09.887 --> 07:11.556
[exhales deeply]

07:13.641 --> 07:15.018
Don't move.

07:21.649 --> 07:23.193
So you watched the fight?

07:25.862 --> 07:28.573
You're supposed to be
doing your homework.

07:28.656 --> 07:30.617
Got it done first.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.035
All of it?

07:33.954 --> 07:37.124
I want you to finish up
before you go to bed.

07:37.207 --> 07:38.959
-I'll do it tomorrow.
-Tonight.

07:39.042 --> 07:42.004
-Before school?
-Tonight.

07:42.087 --> 07:43.880
Okay?

07:43.964 --> 07:45.757
-Okay.

07:50.845 --> 07:51.846
Dad?

07:52.472 --> 07:53.723
[Jack] Uh-huh.

07:54.807 --> 07:56.643
[Matt] You gonna have
enough this month for Mr. Morris?

07:58.520 --> 08:02.690
He will get his rent on time.

08:10.365 --> 08:11.574
You got all this for losing?

08:13.701 --> 08:15.412
Sometimes...

08:15.495 --> 08:18.456
even when you get knocked down,
you can still win.

08:18.540 --> 08:19.916
It ain't how you hit the mat...

08:20.000 --> 08:21.418
[both] It's how you get up.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.170
That's right. [chuckles]

08:24.671 --> 08:26.756
All right, all right.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.508
Go hit the books.

08:28.591 --> 08:29.717
Can I take the bottle?

08:29.801 --> 08:31.761

Could you... could you hear me just now?

Nope.

The correct answer is,
"Yes, and you sound amazing."

Well, [stutters] of the two lies,
I took the lesser.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.539
[Foggy] I thought you went home.
What are you still doing here?

09:41.623 --> 09:42.624
[Karen] Uh...

09:43.416 --> 09:45.001
I could ask you the same.

09:45.085 --> 09:49.131
Yes, but I am a partner
at a prestigious law firm

09:49.214 --> 09:53.343
with very important documents
needing to be documented

09:53.426 --> 09:56.804
so we can start generating
some revenue, while you are...

and I can't climb out.

-You need a hand with that?
-Please.

10:08.983 --> 10:11.986
Oh! Not gonna happen.

10:12.069 --> 10:14.156
[Foggy] Seriously, what are you
still doing here?

10:14.239 --> 10:15.740
I have work to do.

10:15.823 --> 10:17.742
[Foggy] What work?
We don't have any clients yet.

10:17.825 --> 10:20.120
Well, your shit's not gonna unpack itself.

10:20.203 --> 10:24.499
This box of vital import
will be here in the morning.

10:24.582 --> 10:28.461
You should be out having a life,
doing poppers and flapper dancing.

10:28.545 --> 10:31.589
-I don't know what kids do these days.
-We're the same age, Foggy.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.175
So you're saying
I shouldn't be here, either?

10:33.258 --> 10:35.260
-Yeah.
-Fair enough.

10:35.343 --> 10:37.762
But I'm awkward and unfashionable.

10:38.846 --> 10:40.723
Those things don't seem to apply to you.

10:46.396 --> 10:49.023
I just don't feel like
going home...

10:49.106 --> 10:50.107
okay?

10:53.069 --> 10:54.154
Well, we can't stay here.

10:54.237 --> 10:57.782
Not enough money in the kitty
to keep the lights on past midnight.

10:57.865 --> 10:59.742
So let's hop a few bars,
not think about it.

11:02.370 --> 11:04.997
Yes. Big fan of the not thinking.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.292
-[Foggy] You will fit right in here.

Are you gonna listen to me this time?

11:20.179 --> 11:23.516
-Where am I?
-You're in my apartment.

11:23.600 --> 11:24.601
Who are you?

11:25.101 --> 11:27.770
I'm the lucky girl
who pulled you out of the garbage.

11:29.731 --> 11:31.816
-You've seen my face.
-Yeah.

11:34.319 --> 11:35.612
Great.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.280
Your outfit kind of sucks, by the way.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.782
Yeah, it's a work in progress.
[groaning]

11:40.617 --> 11:42.535
Okay, I really wouldn't try
to move too much.

11:42.619 --> 11:45.079
You've got two or three broken ribs,

11:45.162 --> 11:48.791
probable concussion,
some kind of puncture wound,

11:48.875 --> 11:50.918
and that's just the stuff
that I know about.

11:51.002 --> 11:52.295
And your eyes,

11:52.379 --> 11:55.257
they're nonresponsive to light,
which isn't freaking you the hell out,

11:55.340 --> 11:58.426
so either you're blind
or in way worse shape than I thought.

11:58.510 --> 11:59.969
Do I have to pick one?

12:01.596 --> 12:03.931
Do you mind telling me
how a blind man in a mask

12:04.015 --> 12:05.683
ends up beaten half to death
in my dumpster?

12:17.236 --> 12:18.530
Probably. Ah!

-[groaning]
-I think I got the bleeding stopped,

12:21.699 --> 12:25.495
but I can't tell how bad it is internally
without a full series of X-rays, so...

12:25.578 --> 12:27.789
No. No hospitals.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.583
This is my night off.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.627
I'm really not looking for
some guy to die on my couch.

12:32.710 --> 12:33.711
Are you a doctor?

12:35.380 --> 12:36.631
Something like that.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.927
Most people, they find
a bleeding masked man in the garbage...

12:41.010 --> 12:42.512
-they call the police.
-[sighs]

12:42.595 --> 12:45.014
-You got a lot of experience in this area?
-Why are you helping me?

12:48.476 --> 12:50.227
The less you know about me,
the better.

12:50.312 --> 12:52.021
[chuckles] Ah.

12:53.815 --> 12:55.066
[breathing heavily]

12:55.858 --> 12:57.319
You got a name at least?

13:02.574 --> 13:04.409

13:08.871 --> 13:10.332
Don't suppose I get to know yours?

13:14.293 --> 13:16.504
All right, I'll call you Mike.

13:17.171 --> 13:19.841
-Mike?
-Yeah, a guy I used to date.

13:19.924 --> 13:22.885
Turns out he was very good
at keeping secrets, too.

13:31.353 --> 13:33.270
Thank you, Claire.

13:34.188 --> 13:35.440
[sighs]

13:36.649 --> 13:41.821
Rest. Make sure you're stabilized.
We'll figure the other stuff out later.

You were in an accident,
you remember?

You're in the hospital,

[gasping] I can't breathe.

14:38.628 --> 14:40.630
Can't...

You've got air in your chest.
It's collapsing your lung.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.217
I'm gonna relieve the pressure,

14:45.301 --> 14:47.429
but I'm gonna need you
to hold still, okay?

15:48.781 --> 15:50.199
But we need to talk about what happens

15:50.282 --> 15:51.909
if you give up the ghost
here in my living room.

15:52.827 --> 15:55.955
Because I'm listening to myself explain
to the police how I let this happen,

15:56.038 --> 15:58.040
and every version
ends with me in handcuffs,

15:58.124 --> 16:00.334
so convince me it's worth it.

16:01.418 --> 16:03.212
They kidnapped a boy.

16:03.295 --> 16:04.589
Who did?

16:04.672 --> 16:06.090
[breathing heavily]
The Russians.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.136
They've been running
a human trafficking ring

16:10.219 --> 16:11.220
out of Hell's Kitchen.

16:12.722 --> 16:15.057
Took over when the Italians folded up.

16:16.267 --> 16:19.521
Two days ago, they pulled a kid
out of the back of a van.

16:19.604 --> 16:20.855
Beat his father while he watched.

16:20.938 --> 16:22.106
Jesus.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.317
I knew the kid would still be alive.

16:25.401 --> 16:27.820
At least until
they took him out of the city.

16:28.988 --> 16:33.075
I tracked the Russians
to a warehouse not far from here.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.746
Thought I was being smart,
how fast I found them.

16:37.747 --> 16:39.749
Turns out, I wasn't.

16:42.919 --> 16:44.629
They were waiting for you.

16:45.254 --> 16:47.006
And I walked right into it.

16:49.341 --> 16:51.636
So, they took this kid just to get to you?

16:52.637 --> 16:54.764
Yeah, I've been making their lives...

16:55.389 --> 16:58.059
[breathing heavily]
difficult lately.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.143
But you're blind.

16:59.226 --> 17:00.352
[chuckles]

17:01.395 --> 17:03.314
There are other ways to see.

17:03.397 --> 17:04.566
This is what you do?

17:04.649 --> 17:07.109
You make life difficult for bad men?

17:08.360 --> 17:09.486
It's one way of putting it.

17:10.822 --> 17:13.032
No offense, but you don't seem
to be very good at it.

17:13.115 --> 17:14.116
[laughing]

17:14.200 --> 17:15.451
Ow!

17:15.535 --> 17:17.494
Yeah, well,
you're catching me on an off night.

17:19.747 --> 17:21.290
Did you at least find the kid?

17:22.166 --> 17:23.292
[sighs]

17:25.837 --> 17:27.589
No, he wasn't there.

17:28.673 --> 17:30.842
I barely made it out myself.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.219
[sighs] I was careless.

17:34.011 --> 17:35.722
-[sighs]
-Stupid.

17:37.932 --> 17:40.059
So these men that took the boy...

17:40.935 --> 17:43.563
they're out there right now,
looking for you?

17:50.111 --> 17:51.613
-Mike?
-Someone's coming.

17:51.696 --> 17:53.155
Wait, what?

17:53.239 --> 17:56.408
There's someone in the building,
a man, going from door to door.

17:56.492 --> 17:58.285
-How do you know that?
-Shh.

18:01.122 --> 18:02.582
He's on the third floor already.

18:02.665 --> 18:05.918
Smells like Prima cigarettes
and discount cologne.

18:06.002 --> 18:08.462
-[grunts]
-You can smell a man on the third floor?

18:08.545 --> 18:09.631
You'll smell him soon enough.

18:09.714 --> 18:11.924
He really likes that cologne.

18:12.008 --> 18:13.259
[grunting]

18:13.342 --> 18:14.594
[breathing heavily]

18:14.677 --> 18:16.596
You're looking at me
like I'm crazy, right?

18:16.679 --> 18:18.472
Seems the appropriate response.

18:18.555 --> 18:20.516
There are some things
I haven't told you about me, Claire.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.602
You haven't told me anything about you.

18:22.685 --> 18:25.187
All I know is you're very good
at taking a beating.

18:28.858 --> 18:30.985
That part I got from my dad.

18:32.862 --> 18:34.571
-[man] Jack, put your hands up.
-[grunting]

18:34.656 --> 18:36.741
Get in there, come on.
Watch your speed.

18:36.824 --> 18:38.910
Footwork! Footwork, come on.

18:38.993 --> 18:40.494
Watch... Watch out! Oh!

18:41.495 --> 18:42.622
[bell dings]

18:44.123 --> 18:46.167
Way to take a punch, Jack.

18:48.544 --> 18:50.254
[speaking Spanish]

18:53.465 --> 18:55.384
Hey, Jack, shake it off.
You're looking good.

18:55.467 --> 18:56.844
Hey, Jack, what's up?

18:56.928 --> 18:59.972
[indistinct talking]

19:00.056 --> 19:01.515
-[Matt] How'd you do?
-Uh...

19:02.599 --> 19:06.478
I tagged him a couple times.
That kid is fast.

19:07.563 --> 19:10.524
So, how you... how you getting along
with your new books?

19:10.607 --> 19:11.651
I'm working on it.

19:11.734 --> 19:13.986
Each grid is six possible dots,

19:14.070 --> 19:16.823
so each letter
is a combination of those dots.

19:16.906 --> 19:19.283
You have to feel for what's not there
as much as what is.

19:19.366 --> 19:21.911
That doesn't make any damn sense at all.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.789
Well, you know where a punch is going
before it's thrown sometimes, right?

19:24.872 --> 19:26.749
-Oh, clearly I don't.
-[both chuckle]

19:26.833 --> 19:29.501
So, uh,
you can make sense out of all of this?

19:29.585 --> 19:31.628
-I'm starting to. Here.
-Hmm.

19:31.713 --> 19:34.506
Dot in the right corner,
that's a "C."

19:34.590 --> 19:36.300
Upper left, "A."

19:36.383 --> 19:38.761
"T" is hard. I get it confused with "Q."

19:38.845 --> 19:40.554
Well, why don't they just
make it feel like a "T"?

19:40.637 --> 19:43.515
Well, they say this is faster
once you get the hang of it.

19:43.599 --> 19:45.517
"W" is really tricky.

19:45.601 --> 19:48.604
Braille was created in French,
and they don't have "W."

19:49.897 --> 19:51.232
Oi, Battlin' Jack!

19:51.315 --> 19:52.399
[sighs]

19:55.695 --> 19:56.696
Hey, you wait. Couple months,

19:56.779 --> 19:58.865
you're gonna be reading Braille
faster than I read normal.

19:58.948 --> 20:00.908
-I already read Braille faster.
-[chuckles]

20:00.992 --> 20:04.203
Yeah, yeah, I get it.
You smartass.

20:06.247 --> 20:08.665
-I'll be right back.
-[coaches chattering]

20:09.959 --> 20:10.960
[man 1 laughs]

20:11.043 --> 20:14.213
-That's what I'm talking about.
-[man 1] What's the word, Jackie-boy?

20:14.296 --> 20:16.340
Roscoe. Silke.

20:16.423 --> 20:17.884
Hello, Jack.

20:17.967 --> 20:20.970
I heard about the wee one.
That's a tough break.

20:21.553 --> 20:24.640
[Silke] You have our condolences.
[Roscoe] And you're young yet.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.726
Plenty of time to have more kids.

20:29.686 --> 20:31.022
What can I do for you boys?

20:31.105 --> 20:34.358
We come bearing glad tidings.

20:34.441 --> 20:35.735
A match with Creel.

20:37.569 --> 20:39.446
Creel?

20:39.530 --> 20:40.907
How'd you pull that off?

20:41.532 --> 20:47.079
Mr. Sweeney can be quite persuasive
when he puts his mind to it.

20:47.163 --> 20:48.622
It's me Irish charm.

20:48.705 --> 20:50.958
Jesus! Creel?

20:51.042 --> 20:52.501
[Jack chuckles]

20:52.584 --> 20:56.005
-[stuttering] I owe you... I owe you guys.
-[Silke] Ah.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.090
You're doing us the favor.

20:58.174 --> 21:01.260
It's 3-to-1
that you go the distance.

21:02.469 --> 21:06.432
You drop in the fifth,
we're clearing 70%.

21:08.184 --> 21:10.019
-Right.
-[Roscoe] Come on, Jackie!

21:10.102 --> 21:11.562
It's time to celebrate.

21:11.645 --> 21:13.189
[Silke] It's the big time, Jack.

21:16.859 --> 21:18.820
Thanks for the offer.

21:18.903 --> 21:21.488
-I'm gonna take a pass.
-[Roscoe laughs]

21:21.572 --> 21:23.157
Did he just say "pass"?

21:23.240 --> 21:25.159
[Jack] I appreciate everything
you've done for me.

21:25.242 --> 21:26.410
Really, I do.

21:26.493 --> 21:27.661
But...

21:30.456 --> 21:32.708
I got other things
to worry about now.

21:33.625 --> 21:35.795
He don't want to do it, he don't do it.

21:36.838 --> 21:40.341
Man makes his choice and we make ours.

21:40.424 --> 21:43.094
You wanna step into the ring,
see how that plays out?

21:44.678 --> 21:47.014
You gotta think of your family, Jack.

21:47.098 --> 21:50.142
This could do a lot of good for your boy.

21:50.226 --> 21:51.936
[Roscoe] Yeah.

21:52.019 --> 21:54.646
What else are you gonna leave him
when you're gone?

22:02.779 --> 22:05.324
-[Jack] All right.
-We need to hear you say it.

22:09.536 --> 22:12.081
I go down in the fifth.

22:12.164 --> 22:15.292
There you go.
That wasn't so hard.

22:22.799 --> 22:23.843
[Masked Man grunts]

22:24.551 --> 22:25.594
This all you got?

22:25.677 --> 22:27.846
Yeah, it's for vegetables,
not a knife fight.

22:29.431 --> 22:30.641
He's at your neighbor's door.

22:30.724 --> 22:32.977
You kidding me? Hey!

22:33.060 --> 22:36.355
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
You can barely stand up.

22:36.438 --> 22:39.942
-That's what the knife's for.
-Wait! Don't do this. Not in my home.

22:40.026 --> 22:41.235
Okay, nobody has to get hurt.

22:41.318 --> 22:44.363
Just stand over there on the side
and be quiet and I'll get rid of him.

22:44.446 --> 22:45.822
[knocking on door]

22:45.907 --> 22:47.116
Please.

22:48.367 --> 22:49.535
[knocking continues]

22:49.618 --> 22:50.786
Who is it?

22:50.869 --> 22:52.829
NYPD, ma'am.
Please open the door.

22:54.081 --> 22:55.082
Okay.

22:56.542 --> 22:57.584
Go.

22:59.795 --> 23:01.505
I'll be right there.

23:08.512 --> 23:09.846
Move over.

23:15.894 --> 23:17.271
[sighs]

23:21.067 --> 23:22.609
Sorry to bother you so late, ma'am.

23:22.693 --> 23:25.487
My name is Detective Foster,
with the 65th Precinct.

23:25.571 --> 23:27.323
We had a bit of a disturbance
a few blocks from here.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.783
We're asking everyone
if they've seen or heard anything unusual

23:29.866 --> 23:30.867
in the past few hours.

23:30.952 --> 23:34.163
-What kind of disturbance?
-Armed robbery.

23:34.246 --> 23:38.000
Some dickhead in a black mask
shot up a bodega on 38th.

23:38.084 --> 23:39.376
Owner put up a fight.

23:39.460 --> 23:42.213
Perp fled on foot, leaving
a trail of blood in this direction.

23:42.296 --> 23:43.297
Oh, my God.

23:43.380 --> 23:45.882
Probably long gone by now,
but just in case, you know.

23:45.967 --> 23:48.344
You see anything,
hear anything tonight?

23:49.428 --> 23:51.680
No... sorry.

23:51.763 --> 23:53.849
Just being thorough.
You have a good night, ma'am.

23:53.932 --> 23:55.351
Thanks. You, too.

24:04.610 --> 24:06.403
See? No reason to get all stabby.

24:06.487 --> 24:10.199
Boy, were you right about that cologne.
What, does he dip himself in that crap?

24:10.282 --> 24:11.825
He didn't believe you.
[grunts]

24:11.908 --> 24:13.077
[sighs]

24:13.660 --> 24:14.786
Mike!

24:18.207 --> 24:19.583
[speaking Russian]

24:21.793 --> 24:23.212
[Claire] What are you doing?

24:34.181 --> 24:36.225
-[thudding]
-[breathing heavily]

24:42.689 --> 24:43.774
What do we do now?

24:45.442 --> 24:48.362
There's someone else
one floor up watching us.

24:48.445 --> 24:50.531
Oh, no. He's young. He's scared.

24:53.992 --> 24:55.619
[Claire] Santino?

24:57.204 --> 24:59.248
He's the one who found you in the alley.

25:01.083 --> 25:02.418
He's seen my face, too?

25:02.501 --> 25:04.128
Yeah.

25:05.921 --> 25:08.006
Claire, go upstairs and get him.

25:08.090 --> 25:11.093
We're gonna need help
carrying Detective Foster to the roof.

25:11.177 --> 25:12.261
[grunts]

25:13.345 --> 25:15.181
What the hell
are we going to the roof for?

25:16.265 --> 25:18.809
Less chance of someone in the building
hearing him scream.

25:21.478 --> 25:23.522
[rock music playing]

25:23.605 --> 25:24.648
[Foggy] Matt, it's me again.

25:24.731 --> 25:25.857
Where are you?

25:25.941 --> 25:27.276
I'm introducing Karen to Josie's,

25:27.359 --> 25:30.028
and I have high hopes
it's gonna go terribly.

25:30.112 --> 25:32.406
Climb off whoever you're on
and get down here.

25:33.824 --> 25:36.285
You saved the best for last, huh?

25:36.368 --> 25:40.206
Oh, yeah, this place is a shithole...
but it's our shithole.

25:40.289 --> 25:42.874
The city's tried to shut it down
half a dozen times,

25:42.958 --> 25:46.170
but I helped Josie with the liens,
and as a result, we get to drink for free.

25:46.712 --> 25:50.006
You absolutely do not
get to drink for free.

25:51.383 --> 25:52.843
Let's agree to disagree.

25:54.928 --> 25:56.263
Thank you.

25:58.724 --> 25:59.933
Cheers.

26:03.145 --> 26:04.188
Oh! [coughs]

26:04.271 --> 26:06.690
You could do so much better, love.

26:06.773 --> 26:10.319
Thank you, Josie,
but this is my employee...

26:10.402 --> 26:13.071
for your information,
and we are not on a date.

26:13.155 --> 26:14.740
-Are we on a date?
-Definitely not.

26:14.823 --> 26:16.074
Okay, good...

26:16.158 --> 26:18.577
because I was starting to worry
you might be in love with me.

26:18.660 --> 26:21.830
What other explanation could there be?
You hang around my office all day.

26:21.913 --> 26:23.582
Well, I'm your secretary, Foggy.

26:23.665 --> 26:26.293
You refuse to leave.
You're always at your desk.

26:26.377 --> 26:28.003
-I'm a good secretary!
-No.

26:28.086 --> 26:30.631
You gaze at me lovingly
when you think I'm not looking.

26:30.714 --> 26:31.715
[chuckles]

26:31.798 --> 26:34.801
What? You might.
How would I know? I'm not looking.

26:34.885 --> 26:36.137
Just let me live in it.

26:38.096 --> 26:39.223
Oh.

26:43.519 --> 26:45.812
-Is there something in there?
-[clicks tongue]

26:45.896 --> 26:48.440
I... think that's an eel.

26:51.152 --> 26:53.654
-Really?
-Let's get to the bottom and find out.

27:06.417 --> 27:07.459
[sighs]

27:07.543 --> 27:09.253
So you wanna talk about it?

27:10.421 --> 27:13.757
-[sniffs] Let's leave it alone.
-Yeah, no problem.

27:15.509 --> 27:18.053
Okay, technically, "leave it alone"
is not my strong suit, but--

27:18.136 --> 27:19.971
I can't, um...

27:21.890 --> 27:24.851
I can't get Danny's blood
out of the carpet.

27:27.062 --> 27:30.524
It's like somebody spilled a wine bottle
and it just won't come...

27:33.527 --> 27:37.948
And a man broke into my apartment
and tried to kill me.

27:39.115 --> 27:42.286
He dented the wall
where he bashed my head into it.

27:44.996 --> 27:48.667
If that guy in the mask
hadn't have been there...

27:52.003 --> 27:53.464
[sighs]

27:53.547 --> 27:56.967
My cousin does drywall.
I'll call him first thing in the morning.

27:57.050 --> 27:59.261
It's not the apartment, Foggy.

27:59.345 --> 28:00.804
I know.

28:01.763 --> 28:04.182
I don't see the city anymore.

28:06.852 --> 28:09.438
All that I see are its...

28:09.521 --> 28:10.939
dark corners.

28:13.234 --> 28:16.778
I look around this room
and all that I see are threats.

28:16.862 --> 28:19.281
This room? [scoffs]

28:19.365 --> 28:20.741
These guys are harmless.

28:22.200 --> 28:25.704
Look, that's Tom Belkin.

28:25.787 --> 28:27.831
He's the Road Captain
in the Kitchen Hellions.

28:27.914 --> 28:30.667
He organizes the food drive
every Thanksgiving.

28:32.336 --> 28:35.171
That's Rob Donohue.

28:35.256 --> 28:36.257
His wife Mira...

28:36.340 --> 28:39.050
she works at the dry cleaner
around the corner from our office.

28:40.594 --> 28:43.472
That's Clint Peterson. He...

28:43.555 --> 28:45.307
Okay, he is a criminal.

28:45.391 --> 28:48.143
He's done time
for larceny and distribution.

28:48.227 --> 28:49.436
But he's turning it around,

28:49.520 --> 28:52.814
and we are this close to getting his kids
into Saint Agnes Daycare.

28:53.815 --> 28:55.234
Saint Agnes!

28:56.860 --> 28:58.153
[Karen sighs]

28:59.696 --> 29:00.781
Okay.

29:00.864 --> 29:03.409
You don't want to go home,
you don't want to go home.

29:04.701 --> 29:05.869
We can stay out all night.

29:12.876 --> 29:14.210
[sighs heavily]

29:17.005 --> 29:18.214
[grunts]

29:18.965 --> 29:20.175
[Masked Man grunting]

29:23.470 --> 29:24.721
[breathing heavily]

29:27.474 --> 29:29.476
[Masked Man] You find anything?

29:29.560 --> 29:31.853
You smashed the hell out of it
with that extinguisher.

29:33.146 --> 29:34.773
He had a badge.

29:36.442 --> 29:38.444
-What if you're wrong?
-I'm not.

29:40.529 --> 29:44.491
-This is way past what I signed up for.
-What exactly do you think that was?

29:47.369 --> 29:49.496
I found a man who needed help,
so I helped him.

29:49.580 --> 29:50.581
Oh, yeah? That simple?

29:54.751 --> 29:56.712
Do you really want to
get into this in front of him?

29:56.795 --> 29:59.005
He's out.

29:59.089 --> 30:00.173
Maybe he's faking.

30:02.133 --> 30:03.176
He's not.

30:03.259 --> 30:06.597
Okay, that right there,
that's what I'm talking about.

30:06.680 --> 30:08.765
Okay, I find a guy in a dumpster

30:08.849 --> 30:10.726
who turns out to be
some kind of blind vigilante

30:10.809 --> 30:12.561
who can do all of this really weird shit

30:12.644 --> 30:14.730
like smell cologne through walls

30:14.813 --> 30:17.441
and sense whether
someone's unconscious or faking it.

30:17.524 --> 30:20.026
Slap on top of that, he can take
an unbelievable amount of punishment

30:20.110 --> 30:21.236
without one damn complaint.

30:22.112 --> 30:24.239
-The last part's the Catholicism.
-So, what?

30:24.323 --> 30:26.742
I'm supposed to take it on faith
I'm on the right side of this?

30:26.825 --> 30:29.160
You don't carry a masked man
bleeding to death

30:29.244 --> 30:31.455
into your apartment on faith.

30:32.456 --> 30:35.291
You knew which side you were on
the moment you found me.

30:36.585 --> 30:37.961
Why'd you help me, Claire?

30:42.132 --> 30:43.717
I'm a nurse.

30:43.800 --> 30:46.094
Work the ER at Metro-General.

30:46.177 --> 30:48.805
A few weeks ago,
cops bring in three men.

30:49.806 --> 30:52.768
Said they were robbing tourists,
beating them up pretty bad.

30:54.353 --> 30:57.564
Apparently, a man in a black mask
took issue with their activities

30:57.648 --> 31:00.025
and decided to step in.

31:00.108 --> 31:02.903
I counted nine broken bones between them.

31:06.197 --> 31:10.452
A few days after that, EMTs
bring in a 19-year-old waitress, said...

31:11.828 --> 31:14.581
some guy she knew waited for her
after work in the parking lot,

31:14.665 --> 31:17.876
attacked her...
tried to drag her in the alley.

31:17.959 --> 31:23.590
She said she screamed and screamed,
and a man in a black mask heard her...

31:26.259 --> 31:28.053
and he saved her life.

31:31.181 --> 31:33.016
So, yeah, word's getting around.

31:35.226 --> 31:37.521
And I want to believe
in what you're doing.

31:37.604 --> 31:39.355
I really do.

31:39.440 --> 31:40.732
But this?

31:41.858 --> 31:43.026
[Claire scoffs]

31:45.487 --> 31:47.280
I know you're afraid.

31:48.281 --> 31:49.282
[grunts]

31:53.078 --> 31:55.330
You can't give in to the fear.

31:56.498 --> 31:57.916
If you do...

31:59.000 --> 32:00.794
men like this win.

32:02.253 --> 32:05.424
[young Matt] "There is a price to be paid
for division and isolation.

32:05.924 --> 32:09.052
Democracy cannot flourish amid hate.

32:09.135 --> 32:11.555
Justice cannot take root amid rage.

32:11.638 --> 32:14.224
We must dissent from the indifference.

32:14.307 --> 32:16.226
We must dissent from the apathy.

32:16.309 --> 32:18.103
We must dissent from the fear."

32:18.186 --> 32:21.940
Either you're actually reading all that,
or you're making it up as you go along.

32:22.023 --> 32:23.525
I don't know which is more impressive.

32:23.609 --> 32:25.235
-It's Thurgood Marshall.
-Hmm.

32:25.318 --> 32:28.029
Starting centerfielder
for the Mets, right?

32:28.113 --> 32:29.906
You know who Thurgood Marshall is.

32:29.990 --> 32:32.200
[grunting]
School wasn't my strong suit.

32:33.535 --> 32:34.536
[sighs]

32:38.624 --> 32:39.666
[whistles]

32:39.750 --> 32:41.376
-How's it look?
-It's...

32:42.293 --> 32:43.587
it's red.

32:44.796 --> 32:46.590
It's really red.

32:47.799 --> 32:48.800
Can I?

32:51.637 --> 32:52.888
Yeah.

33:10.405 --> 33:12.073
-Good thing about red...
-Huh?

33:12.157 --> 33:13.575
...they can't tell
how much you're bleeding.

33:13.659 --> 33:16.244
Hey, who says I'm even gonna get hit?

33:17.245 --> 33:19.623
We're Murdocks.
We get hit a lot.

33:24.335 --> 33:27.631
-Yeah... I guess we do.
-But we get up.

33:28.715 --> 33:31.009
Right, Dad?

33:32.010 --> 33:33.637
We always get up.

33:42.646 --> 33:43.855
[coin dropping into payphone]

33:44.397 --> 33:45.607
[dialing]

33:49.570 --> 33:51.154
-Hey, it's Jack.
-[man] Hey, Jack.

33:51.237 --> 33:53.198
-Too late to change it?
-You can change it.

33:53.281 --> 33:56.577
Good. All on me.
Win by knockout.

33:56.660 --> 33:58.662
-You sure?
-Yeah.

33:58.745 --> 34:00.706
Yeah, I'm sure.
Listen, you gotta do this quick.

34:00.789 --> 34:04.500
Cash out the second Creel hits the mat.
Don't wait. Okay, get a pen.

34:04.585 --> 34:05.961
All right. Got it.

34:06.044 --> 34:10.882
You're gonna take the money down to
Lloyd Wagner at M and R Credit Union.

34:11.925 --> 34:18.807
You're gonna deposit it into
account number 004-82-56-882.

34:18.890 --> 34:21.476
-Account's in your name?
-No, no, not under my name.

34:21.560 --> 34:24.563
-It's under Matthew Murdock.
-Matthew. Got it.

34:24.646 --> 34:27.023
Yeah, thanks.
Thanks, Ed.

34:27.107 --> 34:29.109
You're gonna want to lay low
for a couple days after.

34:29.192 --> 34:30.276
Can I do anything for you?

34:30.360 --> 34:33.238
Nah, don't worry about me.
I got it covered.

34:47.836 --> 34:49.045
[line ringing]

34:50.463 --> 34:52.758
[woman over answering machine]
Hi. Not here. Leave a message.

34:52.841 --> 34:53.842
[machine beeps]

34:53.925 --> 34:55.343
Hey, it's, uh...

34:55.426 --> 34:56.720
it's me.

34:58.429 --> 35:01.516
I'm about to go do something... Well...

35:01.600 --> 35:03.434
I'm about to go be me.

35:04.686 --> 35:08.314
You know better than anybody
that doesn't always go so well.

35:09.315 --> 35:12.819
I don't know how this is gonna go,
but if I were a betting man...

35:12.903 --> 35:16.281
Matty's gonna need you.
More than ever.

35:18.241 --> 35:19.534
Look after him, okay?

35:19.618 --> 35:23.079
And I know what I'm asking here,
but he's a good kid.

35:24.330 --> 35:26.958
He sure as hell didn't get that from me.

35:27.042 --> 35:28.209
So...

35:30.086 --> 35:31.880
It's better this way.

35:33.924 --> 35:35.341
Just once...

35:37.427 --> 35:40.639
I want Matty to hear people
cheer for his old man.

35:42.808 --> 35:44.142
Just once.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.906
Matt!

35:57.989 --> 36:00.241
Matt, come on!
Get up!

36:00.909 --> 36:02.577
-I drank the eel.
-[laughing]

36:02.661 --> 36:04.079
-Oh, no.
-Not a euphemism.

36:04.162 --> 36:05.580
[both laughing]

36:05.664 --> 36:06.790
Matt, I know you're in there!

36:06.873 --> 36:08.249
-Get up!
-Shh.

36:08.333 --> 36:10.043
-Here, you talk to him.
-Okay.

36:10.126 --> 36:12.128
-[whispering] Pretend I'm not here.
-Okay.

36:12.212 --> 36:13.714
Matt!

36:13.797 --> 36:19.845
Matt, it's Karen...
and I am... very, very sorry about this,

36:19.928 --> 36:23.306
and if I were you,
I would not come to this door.

36:25.600 --> 36:28.061
[chuckling]
But I think I also drank the eel.

36:28.603 --> 36:31.690
And we are now filled
with mighty eel strength!

36:31.773 --> 36:33.817

-It's true. Matt, come on!

36:33.900 --> 36:35.902
-Come on!
-Come on!

-We're staying out till the sunrise!

Oh, no. Oh, Foggy.

36:44.870 --> 36:47.122
-Oh, hi, Fran.
-Oh...

36:47.205 --> 36:48.623
-[Foggy] Sorry.
-We're really sorry.

36:48.707 --> 36:50.709
-Sorry.
-We're sorry. We'll be quiet.

36:50.792 --> 36:52.377
-You wanna go to the fish market?
-[chuckling] No, she...

36:52.460 --> 36:54.545
I'm gonna buy a bluefin.

36:54.629 --> 36:56.882
I'm buying a bluefin, Murdock!

37:01.177 --> 37:04.180
Okay... we've got what?

37:05.265 --> 37:06.933
-Two hours to kill.
-[giggles]

37:07.893 --> 37:11.187
Let's brush you up on
some Japanese auctioneering terms.

37:11.271 --> 37:12.939
Okay, you don't have to do this, Foggy.

37:13.023 --> 37:14.107
Do what?

37:14.190 --> 37:16.151
You haven't lived until you've argued

37:16.234 --> 37:19.738
with a 90-year-old Okinawa survivor
about sturgeon meat.

37:19.821 --> 37:20.947
[chuckling]

37:22.240 --> 37:23.992
Thank you.

37:24.075 --> 37:25.869
I needed this.
I really needed this.

37:25.952 --> 37:28.163
But it's late, and we should go home.

37:28.246 --> 37:29.539
-Are you kidding me?
-Yes.

37:29.622 --> 37:32.208
After what you told me,
I'm never going home again.

37:32.292 --> 37:34.795
Men are waiting in the dark corners
of this world to prey on us.

37:34.878 --> 37:35.879
Oh, God.

37:35.962 --> 37:38.714
The valiant, the kindhearted.

37:38.799 --> 37:41.342
We must band together.
We must never sleep.

37:41.426 --> 37:43.511
We must remain vigilant.

37:43.594 --> 37:46.347
Here in the lights of Hell's Kitchen.

37:46.431 --> 37:47.974
Never sleep!

37:49.059 --> 37:51.394
-This city will protect us!
-[Karen giggles]

37:52.353 --> 37:53.772
-[Foggy] This city's beautiful.
-Yeah.

38:05.658 --> 38:06.993
[inhales deeply]

38:22.801 --> 38:24.385
Here's how this is gonna work.

38:25.428 --> 38:28.849
I'm gonna ask you some questions.
You're gonna answer them.

38:28.932 --> 38:30.809
If you're lying to me...

38:31.726 --> 38:33.269
trust that I will know...

38:34.270 --> 38:35.897
and I will be unhappy.

38:37.482 --> 38:38.566
Where's the boy?

38:39.775 --> 38:41.069
He's dead.

38:42.904 --> 38:43.989
[coughing]

38:46.491 --> 38:48.784
-[breathing heavily]
-This is what unhappy looks like.

38:48.869 --> 38:50.036
Where's the boy?

38:51.204 --> 38:54.165
What do you care?
If he's not dead yet, he will be.

38:54.249 --> 38:56.960
-Why did you take him?
-Figured you'd come running.

38:57.585 --> 38:58.879
And after I was dead?

38:58.962 --> 39:02.298
Sell the kid, like all the others.

39:03.508 --> 39:04.800
[both grunting]

39:06.552 --> 39:09.514
I was telling the truth on that one.

39:09.597 --> 39:10.640
I know.

39:10.723 --> 39:13.768
We got you good, didn't we?

39:13.852 --> 39:17.063
-Who do you sell the children to?
-I don't know.

39:17.147 --> 39:18.982
Whoever has the money.

39:19.900 --> 39:21.526
Where's the boy?

39:21.609 --> 39:24.654
So you find him. So what?

39:24.737 --> 39:25.864
We'll take another.

39:26.865 --> 39:29.825
Kill me, somebody takes my place.

39:29.910 --> 39:33.163
Long as people are buying,
we'll be selling.

39:34.080 --> 39:35.790
Nothing you do tonight will change that.

39:36.875 --> 39:40.962
But go ahead. Keep hitting me.
Let's see who drops first.

39:42.380 --> 39:44.382
Try stabbing him in his trigeminal nerve.

39:46.009 --> 39:47.468
Where is it?

39:47.552 --> 39:50.180
Go in through here,
right above the eye.

39:50.263 --> 39:54.100
That's the supraorbital foramen.
You want to go in right under there.

39:56.602 --> 39:57.770
[breathing heavily]

39:58.354 --> 39:59.439
[Masked Man] Hold still.

39:59.981 --> 40:02.358
I might do some serious damage
if you squirm.

40:02.442 --> 40:03.818
[panting]

40:04.986 --> 40:06.529
How will I know when I find it?

40:07.613 --> 40:08.739
He'll tell you.

40:08.823 --> 40:10.951
[breathing heavily]

40:12.535 --> 40:14.120
[screaming]

40:26.967 --> 40:28.759
[Masked Man] You're right...

40:28.843 --> 40:30.220
what you said before.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.848
I kill you, somebody takes your place,

40:33.932 --> 40:35.766
but they'll end up back here
just like you,

40:35.850 --> 40:38.979
and sooner or later, one of you
is gonna tell me what I need to know.

40:40.480 --> 40:41.606

-[groaning]
-Shh!

40:54.244 --> 40:56.955
Listen, I need you to know
why I'm hurting you.

40:58.206 --> 40:59.290
It's not just the boy.

40:59.958 --> 41:02.252
I'm doing this 'cause I enjoy it.

41:02.335 --> 41:03.419
[man] No, no, no!

41:03.503 --> 41:04.795
No, no, no!

41:06.089 --> 41:07.090
[Masked Man] Where is he?

41:09.550 --> 41:11.052
Where is he?

41:12.637 --> 41:14.764
[sobbing] No!

41:15.348 --> 41:18.601

41:23.398 --> 41:24.482
[chuckles]

41:26.192 --> 41:27.402
They'll be waiting for you.

41:28.528 --> 41:31.197
If you're lucky, they'll kill you
before they start in on the boy.

41:32.532 --> 41:35.743
It would be a shame for you
to have to watch what they do to him-- Oh!

41:35.826 --> 41:36.952
[Claire shrieking]

-[Claire] Oh, my God!
-It's all right.

41:42.250 --> 41:44.419
He landed in the dumpster
you pulled me out of.

41:44.502 --> 41:45.878
Is he dead?

41:45.961 --> 41:47.463
[breathing heavily]

41:50.591 --> 41:52.052
He'll live.

41:53.303 --> 41:57.223
You need to get your things and leave.
Don't tell anyone where you're going.

42:00.060 --> 42:01.061
What?

42:02.812 --> 42:05.565
[grunts]
He wakes up, he'll be back...

42:05.648 --> 42:07.858
and he won't be alone next time.

42:07.942 --> 42:09.277
But he didn't see my face.

42:09.360 --> 42:12.405
That was just for effect, to scare him.

42:12.488 --> 42:14.199
He knew you were lying
when you answered your door.

42:14.282 --> 42:16.576

-Mike...

42:17.910 --> 42:19.162
[breathing heavily]

42:20.621 --> 42:23.541
Do you have somewhere you can go?

42:23.624 --> 42:27.087
I'm cat-sitting for...
a woman I work with.

42:28.504 --> 42:29.880
Her brother's sick. She's in Oklahoma.

42:29.964 --> 42:31.049
What's the address?

42:32.007 --> 42:33.176
Why?

42:34.427 --> 42:36.637
I'm thinking if
I make it through the night,

42:36.721 --> 42:37.972
I may need some help getting patched up.
