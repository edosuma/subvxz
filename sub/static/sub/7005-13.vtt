WEBVTT

00:01.567 --> 00:05.270
Tim, why is it always...
Quiet. Pretend like
it didn't happen.

00:10.810 --> 00:14.379
Welcome back to a new segment
here on <i>tool time</i> -
the resourceful tool man.

00:14.380 --> 00:17.416
Where we show you how
a tool man can be...
Resourceful.

00:21.387 --> 00:23.121
And redundant.

00:28.394 --> 00:31.062
Today the resourceful tool man
goes to the kitchen.

00:35.133 --> 00:37.602
Say you have a hankering
for cheese and crackers.

00:37.603 --> 00:39.404
But every knife is filthy.

00:39.405 --> 00:42.741
Your wife's
not there to wash them.
So, what are you gonna do?

00:42.742 --> 00:45.477
You could clean one yourself.

00:45.478 --> 00:50.081
Al, I'll do the jokes.

00:50.082 --> 00:53.552
Or you could run upstairs
to the bathroom
and get some dental floss.

00:53.553 --> 00:56.221
Heidi, my dental floss, please.
Here you are, tim.

00:56.222 --> 00:57.789
Thank you.
You're welcome.

00:57.790 --> 00:59.891
Use unwaxed
for your softer cheeses.

00:59.892 --> 01:02.927
Waxed for your
cheddars and gouda.

01:06.332 --> 01:09.033
Nobody cuts
the cheese like al.

01:12.438 --> 01:15.473
Ok, now, let's say your wife's
a little ticked at ya

01:15.474 --> 01:19.176
Because instead of
fixing the stove,
you blew it up.

01:19.177 --> 01:21.713
She's saying, <i>(high voice)</i>
"what are we gonna do now?

01:21.714 --> 01:25.550
Poach the fish in what,
you lunkhead?
What am I gonna do?"

01:25.551 --> 01:29.120
<i>(high voice)</i>
"I have a 12-pound fish and
it's all gonna go to waste."

01:31.124 --> 01:34.359
What? I don't do
a woman's voice
as well as you?

01:34.360 --> 01:37.395
No. You do it
a little too well.

01:39.432 --> 01:43.835
The resourceful tool man
doesn't need a working stove
to make a delicious meal.

01:43.836 --> 01:46.070
Exactly, al. All you need
is heat and steam.

01:46.071 --> 01:49.040
And what better way to use that
than in the dishwasher?

01:49.041 --> 01:52.076
Here's your fresh
piece of salmon, tim.
Thank you, heidi.

01:52.077 --> 01:55.480
Aah! There's a piece of fish!

01:55.481 --> 01:58.550
I'm gonna season my fish
with a little dill.

02:00.352 --> 02:03.521
Fold the tinfoil, and set it on
the top shelf in the dishwasher.

02:03.522 --> 02:06.591
Making sure to hit
the dry cycle.
And in 25 minutes,

02:06.592 --> 02:08.827
You have a perfectly
poached fish.

02:08.828 --> 02:11.729
We don't have to wait.
We have a fish in there.

02:11.730 --> 02:13.731
When it's done,
we'll pull it out.
<i>(bell dings)</i>

02:13.732 --> 02:16.067
There it is.

02:16.068 --> 02:18.903
You hungry, al?
I'm famished.

02:18.904 --> 02:20.938
All right!

02:28.514 --> 02:30.682
Did you hit dry cycle?

02:30.683 --> 02:33.451
Oh, I went with
the pot scrubber.

03:23.469 --> 03:26.070
Randy, the haircut is fine.

03:26.071 --> 03:28.105
You're just
a little over-moussed.

03:35.981 --> 03:38.616
I need this out of my hair
before someone sees me.

03:38.617 --> 03:41.953
Yeah.
Hey, randy!
Great haircut.

03:41.954 --> 03:45.123
Looks like dad when
he tried to soup up
the toaster.

03:47.259 --> 03:52.497
Brad, there is a perfectly
fine haircut under there...
Somewhere.

03:52.498 --> 03:55.166
I'm gonna go shampoo
and see if I can find it.

03:55.167 --> 03:57.035
How was school?
Great.

03:57.036 --> 03:59.504
I can't wait for
history class tomorrow.

03:59.505 --> 04:03.241
Wow, it's nice to hear
you talk like that!
What are you studying?

04:03.242 --> 04:05.376
This new girl,
angela lawson.

04:07.346 --> 04:09.513
I'm home.
<i>(jill)</i> hi, sweetie.

04:09.514 --> 04:11.683
Hey, dad.
Hey, brad.
How's it going?

04:11.684 --> 04:14.251
Great. I can't wait to go
to school tomorrow.

04:14.252 --> 04:15.987
New girl?
Yup.

04:17.456 --> 04:19.257
<i>(phone ringing)</i>

04:19.257 --> 04:22.359
I got it.
It's for me.

04:22.360 --> 04:27.197
Hello? Oh, hi, uncle marty.
Yeah, he's right here.

04:27.198 --> 04:28.833
Try not to talk too long.

04:28.834 --> 04:31.001
I'm expecting a really
important phone call.

04:33.271 --> 04:35.172
Yup. New girl.

04:37.242 --> 04:40.878
Get a haircut, will you?
Hey, marty. How's it going?

04:40.879 --> 04:42.881
Oh, no, marty. No.

04:42.882 --> 04:45.750
What's wrong?
He lost his job.

04:45.751 --> 04:47.185
That's too bad. Yeah.
What'd the guy...

04:47.186 --> 04:50.021
Dad, could you hurry?
I have to call angela.

04:50.022 --> 04:53.558
Your uncle just
lost his job.
I know.

04:53.559 --> 04:56.861
I just thought angela's
the kind of girl I could
share my grief with.

05:00.265 --> 05:02.233
<i>(beeping)</i>

05:16.047 --> 05:19.450
It doesn't work on
the rinse cycle either.

05:19.451 --> 05:20.652
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

05:20.653 --> 05:22.654
I got it.
All right.

05:22.655 --> 05:24.689
Hey, brad.
Hi, uncle marty.

05:24.690 --> 05:27.359
How're you doing?
Good.

05:27.360 --> 05:29.494
You were supposed to call
after the interview.

05:29.495 --> 05:32.130
I tried. The phone's
been busy for hours.

05:32.131 --> 05:34.899
Brad, I asked you to stay off
the phone, didn't I?

05:34.900 --> 05:37.202
It's not fair that you
always assume it was me.

05:37.203 --> 05:38.470
Was it?

05:38.471 --> 05:40.471
Yeah.
But it still isn't fair.

05:41.774 --> 05:47.545
Hey, marty, something to drink?
Beer? Mug of fish?

05:47.546 --> 05:49.213
Um, beer.

05:51.449 --> 05:55.152
So, how'd the interview go?
Oh, it went great.

05:55.153 --> 05:58.890
The guy and I hit it off.
Says I'm qualified.
I remind him of his nephew.

05:58.891 --> 06:02.060
You got the job?
No. He hired the nephew.

06:02.061 --> 06:05.696
Pretty tough out there,
isn't it?
Mm, you're telling me.

06:05.697 --> 06:07.631
Come on. Sit down.

06:07.632 --> 06:12.737
I've had so many doors
slammed in my face,
I need a doorstop on my nose.

06:12.738 --> 06:16.207
Well, binford makes a nice one.

06:16.208 --> 06:19.377
Speaking of that,
I've been thinking about it.

06:19.378 --> 06:22.547
We're building a new set
for <i>tool time,</i>
and we could use help.

06:22.548 --> 06:24.782
You offering me a job?
It's nothing much.

06:24.783 --> 06:28.285
I'll take it!
Well, I'll need
some references.

06:30.355 --> 06:32.190
What? You're my reference.

06:32.191 --> 06:35.960
No wonder you haven't
found any work.
Oh, yeah.

06:35.961 --> 06:38.996
Hey, marty.
How's the job hunt?
Oh, it's terrific.

06:38.997 --> 06:40.998
Yeah?
It's over.

06:40.999 --> 06:45.069
That's great.
What will you be doing?
I'm working for tim.

06:45.070 --> 06:47.838
Great!

06:47.839 --> 06:49.774
We haven't worked together
since we were kids.

06:49.775 --> 06:53.611
Remember that little stand?
What a great team we were!

06:53.612 --> 06:56.848
A lemonade stand.
That's so cute.

06:56.849 --> 07:00.818
Right. It was a lube
and oil change stand.
Of course.

07:00.819 --> 07:03.788
We were a great team
back then.
Yeah. It was great.

07:03.789 --> 07:06.323
Hey, I gotta go home
and tell nancy to stop crying.

07:06.324 --> 07:07.892
I'll see you later.
Yeah.

07:07.893 --> 07:10.862
And thanks, man.
You're a lifesaver.
Thank you.

07:10.863 --> 07:13.230
Ok, bye.
You can start
tomorrow morning.

07:13.231 --> 07:14.932
Terrific.

07:18.570 --> 07:21.473
Hey, al. Plans for the new
<i>tool time</i> set. Take a look.

07:21.474 --> 07:24.242
Wow! We're dealing
with more space.

07:24.243 --> 07:27.612
We're going modular.
Our tools will be
right at our fingertips.

07:27.613 --> 07:30.381
We've come a long way,
my friend.

07:30.382 --> 07:34.419
Remember when we were
just two crazy young
tool men with a dream?

07:34.420 --> 07:39.924
Actually, al,
it was one tool man
and an extra stool.

07:39.925 --> 07:42.694
You remember it your way,
I'll remember it my way.

07:42.695 --> 07:45.229
Come on,
it's a great time for us.
<i>Tool time</i> is taking off.

07:45.230 --> 07:48.065
My favorite brother's
working for us.
I envy you.

07:48.066 --> 07:51.736
I've always dreamed
of working with my brother,
cal, side by side.

07:51.737 --> 07:54.439
Actually, that would be
"wide by wide," wouldn't it?

07:55.875 --> 07:57.709
Hey, guys.

07:57.710 --> 07:59.911
There he is now.
All right.
Welcome aboard.

07:59.912 --> 08:02.713
Hey! Glad to be aboard, al.
Thanks. How're you doing?

08:02.714 --> 08:04.915
Sorry I'm late.
I couldn't find
my parking space.

08:04.916 --> 08:08.086
The reason for that is, marty,
you don't have a parking place.

08:08.087 --> 08:12.857
Don't feel bad. Neither do I.
I've been here six years.

08:12.858 --> 08:15.960
Six years.
Jeez, that's real fair, tim.

08:15.961 --> 08:18.630
Well, it's a small
parking lot, marty.

08:18.631 --> 08:21.833
Yeah, but you have a space.
Hey, I got an idea!

08:21.834 --> 08:24.368
Why don't you
alternate with al?
That's a great idea!

08:27.172 --> 08:30.808
Marty, I didn't hire you
as a parking lot consultant.

08:30.809 --> 08:33.711
You're here
to help build the set.
I know. I'm excited...

08:33.712 --> 08:36.047
No matter what my wife said.

08:36.048 --> 08:39.150
Probably what my wife said -
brothers shouldn't
work together.

08:39.150 --> 08:44.087
No, that brothers as immature
as us shouldn't work together.

08:44.089 --> 08:45.790
We'll show them, won't we?

08:45.791 --> 08:48.059
<i>(goofy laughing)</i>

08:48.060 --> 08:51.729
Why don't you drop
your gear in the back,
pick up an extra tool belt?

08:51.730 --> 08:54.131
Morning, guys.
Hey, heidi.

08:54.132 --> 08:57.969
Hey, who parked
in my space?
Heidi has a parking space?!

09:01.773 --> 09:03.707
What do you want
me to do next?

09:03.708 --> 09:05.209
Help al bring
that wood over here.

09:05.210 --> 09:07.778
We'll start on
the interview desk.

09:07.779 --> 09:09.413
Hey, is that rosewood?

09:09.414 --> 09:12.316
Honduran rosewood.
Isn't it great?

09:12.317 --> 09:15.519
Sure, if you don't mind
pillaging the rain forest.

09:15.520 --> 09:17.422
We're not pillaging
the rain forest.

09:17.423 --> 09:20.625
This wood was grown by farmers
specifically for commercial use.

09:20.626 --> 09:23.194
That's what they always say.
But did you check it out?

09:23.195 --> 09:26.730
Well, of course we did, marty.
While you were
eating your sandwich,

09:26.731 --> 09:29.834
Al and I drove down to honduras.

09:29.835 --> 09:34.571
Pardon me for caring.
Pardon me for getting
the job done.

09:34.572 --> 09:37.307
Sorry I'm slowing you up.
I was expressing my opinion.

09:37.308 --> 09:39.476
My opinion is,
keep your opinion
to yourself.

09:39.477 --> 09:40.745
That's your opinion.
Uh-huh.

09:40.746 --> 09:43.181
Guys, guys...
Al, stay out of this.

09:43.182 --> 09:45.049
You'll be parking
in honduras, ok?

09:56.061 --> 09:58.395
You're doing it again.

09:58.396 --> 10:00.464
I hate it when you
look over my shoulder.

10:00.465 --> 10:04.501
I can't look under
your shoulder. I get that
horrible armpit smell.

10:04.502 --> 10:06.570
I can smell yours
all across the room.

10:14.512 --> 10:17.481
All right, what?
What is it?
What's the problem?

10:17.482 --> 10:19.750
You're glopping, marty.
I'm not glopping.

10:19.751 --> 10:22.253
You're glopping.
I am not.
I know how to paint.

10:22.254 --> 10:25.422
You're glopping right now.
I am not. It's fine.
They're fine.

10:25.423 --> 10:30.895
Boys, boys, remember what you
said? Brothers getting along,
being mature?

10:30.896 --> 10:34.965
All right, I'm sorry
I was criticizing you.
It's just...

10:34.966 --> 10:40.137
When I notice somebody painting
in a "glop-esque" manner

10:40.138 --> 10:44.375
That can result
in peghole pluggage...

10:44.376 --> 10:47.978
Well, your point
is well taken, tim.
Thank you.

10:47.979 --> 10:52.917
However, one could also argue
that peghole pluggage

10:52.918 --> 10:58.356
Could easily be remedied
with toothpick pokage.

10:58.357 --> 11:01.693
Toothpick pokage?
Go back over the job twice?
You gotta...

11:01.694 --> 11:06.997
I say we stop this arguing
and we settle this
with a group huggage.

11:15.107 --> 11:18.409
Whoa! Here comes brad
with his new girlfriend.

11:20.813 --> 11:22.746
Hello!

11:24.883 --> 11:27.718
Man! What's she doing
with a guy like him?

11:27.719 --> 11:31.655
Guys, guys,
get away from the window.
Stop spying on your brother.

11:31.656 --> 11:34.826
Whoa, she is cute!

11:34.827 --> 11:36.093
Mom...

11:36.094 --> 11:38.529
Wait, wait.
Act natural,
they're coming.

11:41.066 --> 11:44.202
Hey, everybody.

11:44.203 --> 11:46.770
Everybody, this is angela.
Randy, mark and my mom.

11:46.771 --> 11:49.640
Well, hi.
It's nice to meet you.
You, too.

11:49.641 --> 11:53.077
I heard that you
just moved to town.

11:53.078 --> 11:54.712
How are you liking it so far?

11:54.713 --> 11:57.247
At first I didn't, 'cause,
like, I didn't have friends.

11:57.248 --> 12:00.485
But I started to make,
like, friends. Then I was,
like, popular.

12:00.486 --> 12:03.620
I love being really popular
'cause back home the only
popular girls

12:03.621 --> 12:06.324
Were the cheerleaders.
But I have really weak ankles.

12:06.325 --> 12:10.027
It was such a drag
because I would look
so hot in that outfit.

12:10.028 --> 12:13.664
And I'm a really good speller.
Does that answer your question?

12:13.665 --> 12:16.400
That and so much more.

12:18.737 --> 12:21.238
Let's start
our homework.
Good idea.

12:21.239 --> 12:25.242
Let's start with history because
that's the most boringest.
French is more boring,

12:25.243 --> 12:28.846
But not as boring
as french history...

12:28.847 --> 12:31.982
She's great, isn't she?

12:31.983 --> 12:35.253
Sure does talk a lot.

12:35.254 --> 12:38.389
She says a lot because
she's, like, really popular.

12:38.390 --> 12:42.493
And you know how hard it is
being real popular when you
have, like, weak ankles.

12:42.494 --> 12:45.329
Randy, stop it.

12:45.330 --> 12:47.731
Oh, hi, sweetie.
Hi.

12:47.732 --> 12:50.767
Mm. Well, how was your day
with your favorite brother?

12:52.571 --> 12:57.041
Well, I guess it's
a good time for the wife
to say "I told you so."

12:57.042 --> 13:02.246
Oh, I don't want to take
pleasure in the fact that I was
right and you were wrong.

13:02.247 --> 13:06.250
Why? If I were
ever right, I would.

13:06.251 --> 13:10.454
Well, then,
I have nothing to worry about.
So, what did he do?

13:10.455 --> 13:12.189
He complained all day.

13:12.190 --> 13:14.925
He took, like, six hours
to chew his bologna sandwich.

13:14.926 --> 13:18.095
He got al hopped up about
not having a parking space.

13:18.096 --> 13:22.733
Well, that's bad. Wait a minute.
Al doesn't have a parking space?

13:22.734 --> 13:25.969
Why is everyone so concerned
about where al parks?

13:25.970 --> 13:28.038
What am I gonna
do about marty?

13:28.039 --> 13:30.508
Well, you don't
have much choice.

13:30.509 --> 13:32.876
You'll have to figure out
a way to make it work.

13:32.877 --> 13:35.847
Or I can fire him.
You can't fire
your own brother!

13:35.848 --> 13:38.115
I don't want another
day like today.

13:38.116 --> 13:41.852
No more yakking or complaining
the rest of the night.

13:41.853 --> 13:43.921
Do you have soda?
Yeah. It's in the fridge.

13:43.922 --> 13:47.325
I can't have diet.
My mom believes artificial
sweeteners are bad.

13:47.326 --> 13:49.927
You have is root beer which is,
like, really gross.

13:49.928 --> 13:53.130
Or apple juice which is
really bad for your teeth
unless you water it down.

13:53.131 --> 13:56.067
So I'll just wait
till I get home. Hi.

14:04.109 --> 14:07.044
Brad's new girlfriend?
Uh-huh.

14:07.045 --> 14:09.113
Cute.

14:13.552 --> 14:15.485
Wilson?

14:15.486 --> 14:17.888
Well, hi-de-ho, neighbor.

14:17.889 --> 14:21.391
What are you doing?
Tim, I'm practicing hurling.

14:23.694 --> 14:27.365
Try some of jill's meat loaf,
you'll become an expert.

14:27.366 --> 14:28.932
<i>(laughs)</i>

14:28.933 --> 14:30.934
No, tim.

14:30.935 --> 14:33.404
Hurling is an
ancient irish sport.

14:33.405 --> 14:36.274
It's quite akin
to field hockey.

14:36.275 --> 14:39.710
Speaking of "kin,"
I hired my brother marty
to work at <i>tool time,</i>

14:39.711 --> 14:42.647
And ever since he's been there
he's been driving me crazy.

14:42.648 --> 14:44.415
Mm, mm-hm.
Mm-hm, mm-hm.

14:44.416 --> 14:46.083
He thinks
I'm bossing him around.

14:46.084 --> 14:48.152
I think he's just
a pain in the butt.

14:48.153 --> 14:50.487
I might have to fire him.
Hm.

14:50.488 --> 14:53.190
I'm reminded of the story
of romulus and remus.

14:53.191 --> 14:56.627
Huh?

14:56.628 --> 15:00.264
Two brothers who were
abandoned at birth
and nursed by a she-wolf.

15:00.265 --> 15:04.201
Sounds like the story
of al and cal borland.

15:04.202 --> 15:10.541
Romulus and remus were close
until they decided to work
together to build a city.

15:10.542 --> 15:14.911
Yeah? What happened?
Romulus wanted
things his way.

15:14.912 --> 15:17.781
Remus disagreed
and that angered romulus.

15:17.782 --> 15:20.918
So you know what he did?
I'd fire him!

15:20.919 --> 15:23.988
No, he killed him.
Oh, boy! Oh, boy.

15:23.989 --> 15:25.822
I guess when you're
raised by a wolf,

15:25.823 --> 15:29.293
You lack certain
social skills.

15:29.294 --> 15:32.229
No, tim. The point is
if romulus hadn't been so rash

15:32.230 --> 15:33.830
And met his brother halfway,

15:33.831 --> 15:35.966
They might've been able
to patch things up.

15:35.967 --> 15:38.769
Oh, I see. I should
try to meet marty halfway.

15:38.770 --> 15:40.638
There you go.
<i>(beeping)</i>

15:40.639 --> 15:43.407
Hold on a minute. Oh!

15:43.408 --> 15:47.110
Love to sit and talk,
but I've got an eight-pound
sturgeon in the dishwasher.

15:51.583 --> 15:53.784
Marty, it's early.
What are you doing here?

15:53.785 --> 15:56.286
There's something
I want to talk to you about.

15:56.287 --> 15:59.556
I know what it is.
You figure we should
work things out.

15:59.557 --> 16:04.127
Or we'll turn into
romeo and rolex.

16:04.128 --> 16:06.497
Huh?

16:06.498 --> 16:10.634
The two brothers that
had the severe rash that
built the halfway house?

16:13.872 --> 16:17.975
Look, tim, it's obvious
that we can't work together,
so I'm quitting.

16:17.976 --> 16:20.611
You're quitting?
Yeah.

16:20.612 --> 16:24.347
You're impossible
to work for.
I'm impossible to work for?

16:24.348 --> 16:28.385
You're a control freak.
Everything's gotta be done
on your schedule and your way.

16:28.386 --> 16:30.988
Let's figure out why that is.
Let's think, you and I.

16:30.989 --> 16:34.492
Why would that be? Why?
Um, it's coming to me...

16:34.493 --> 16:37.928
My show. I'm boss.
Maybe that's it?
Oh, right.

16:37.929 --> 16:40.297
Thanks, tim.
It's been a million laughs.

16:40.298 --> 16:42.966
Marty, you can't
afford to quit.

16:42.967 --> 16:44.702
Oh, don't tell me
what I can afford.

16:44.703 --> 16:46.804
You're not the only brother
I can turn to.

16:46.805 --> 16:48.739
If I have to,
I'll borrow money from john.

16:48.740 --> 16:51.374
He's in worse shape
than you.
He'll get it from jeff.

16:51.375 --> 16:53.711
Where's he gonna get it?
He'll get it
from rick.

16:53.712 --> 16:57.014
Where's rick gonna
get the money?
From you.

16:59.050 --> 17:03.020
How about this? "wanted:
Bright, energetic, self-starter

17:03.021 --> 17:07.257
Willing to work long hours and
weekends for very little pay."

17:07.258 --> 17:09.259
I already got that job.

17:11.128 --> 17:13.230
What about this one?

17:13.231 --> 17:15.031
I'm not gonna
be a nude model.

17:18.435 --> 17:20.470
Hey, harry. Hi, guys.
Hey, tim.

17:20.471 --> 17:24.375
Hey, tim.
Hey, marty.
What are you doing here?

17:24.376 --> 17:25.709
What do you think I'm doing?

17:25.710 --> 17:27.477
What you did when
you worked for me -

17:27.478 --> 17:30.247
Nothin'.

17:30.248 --> 17:33.117
I don't have to listen to you.
I'm not working for you.

17:33.118 --> 17:35.753
No. You don't have to because
I'm not talking to you.

17:35.754 --> 17:38.255
Well, I wasn't
talking to you first.
Really?

17:38.256 --> 17:41.392
I wasn't talking to you
"infinity and beyond."

17:41.393 --> 17:44.627
Hey, tim! You should
be ashamed of yourself.

17:44.628 --> 17:46.830
You "trow" your brother
out on the street?

17:46.831 --> 17:51.235
I didn't "trow" him anywhere.
He walked out.

17:51.236 --> 17:52.970
Yeah. That's right. I quit.

17:52.971 --> 17:56.573
Because tim's
a jerk to work for.
Oh, I'm a jerk?

17:56.574 --> 18:00.244
This is why I make it a policy
never to work with family.

18:00.245 --> 18:04.615
Yeah. That and the fact nobody
in your family would hire ya.

18:04.616 --> 18:08.018
If we shop
in the same hardware store,
we gotta mark our territories.

18:08.019 --> 18:11.221
My zones - automotive,
plumbing, power tools

18:11.222 --> 18:13.123
And small nuts and bolts.

18:13.124 --> 18:15.158
Hey! How come you get
all the good stuff?

18:15.159 --> 18:16.894
Because I got
the tool show.

18:16.895 --> 18:19.162
Oh, right. I forgot.
Mr. "tool man."

18:19.163 --> 18:20.931
Ooh!

18:22.834 --> 18:24.200
That's real funny, marty.

18:24.201 --> 18:26.069
What does that
leave me with? Brooms.

18:26.070 --> 18:29.640
Oh, and plungers,
too, martin.

18:29.641 --> 18:31.708
Aw, that's it.

18:31.709 --> 18:35.178
Oh, a toilet float.
That's mature.

18:35.179 --> 18:37.747
Hey! Hey!
Guys! Guys! Guys!

18:37.748 --> 18:41.518
Hey, hey, hey!
I'm trying to run
a business here!

18:41.519 --> 18:43.920
You know, people come
in here and buy things?

18:43.921 --> 18:46.456
Or at least they used to.

18:46.457 --> 18:47.691
Ok, ok, ok!

18:47.692 --> 18:50.694
If you two don't stop
acting like babies,

18:50.695 --> 18:53.363
I'm gonna ask you
both to leave.

18:53.364 --> 18:55.666
Leave?
You're throwing us out?

18:55.667 --> 19:00.271
I believe that was
the gist of his drift.

19:00.272 --> 19:02.640
No one's ever kicked me out
of a hardware store before.

19:02.641 --> 19:05.509
Me neither.
I've been kicked out
of school, church...

19:05.510 --> 19:07.244
My own house.

19:07.245 --> 19:09.179
<i>(both)</i> girls' locker room.

19:11.883 --> 19:14.451
Wow, we've been kicked out
of a lot of places.

19:14.452 --> 19:16.921
Never a hardware store.

19:16.922 --> 19:21.058
I think this time
we went too far.

19:21.059 --> 19:24.595
The reason I treat you
like that is I'm the boss.
I got a job to do, you know?

19:24.596 --> 19:29.767
Yeah, I know.
I guess I was acting
like kind of a butt.

19:29.768 --> 19:32.770
Kinda?

19:32.771 --> 19:35.539
All right. I appreciate
that you offered me the job.

19:35.540 --> 19:39.576
I would just appreciate
it even more if you never
offered me another one.

19:39.577 --> 19:44.548
I'd appreciate it if I
slip up and do offer you a job,
you won't take it.

19:44.549 --> 19:47.818
Ok.

19:47.819 --> 19:50.921
So, what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
I gotta find something.

19:50.922 --> 19:54.224
How about construction?
I got a buddy over
at k&b construction.

19:54.225 --> 19:56.693
They always
look for people.
That'd be great.

19:56.694 --> 19:58.696
I'll give him a call.
Terrific.

19:58.697 --> 20:01.332
Let's go to big mike's.
Wanna beer?
Yeah.

20:01.333 --> 20:02.999
All right.
See you, guys.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.902
See you, tim.
Later, marty.
<i>(beeping)</i>

20:05.903 --> 20:08.038
We gotta stop by
the house real quick.

20:10.741 --> 20:12.409
Flounder?
Mackerel.

20:23.821 --> 20:28.491
Welcome to the
brand-new <i>tool time</i> set.
We got a lot more tools.

20:28.492 --> 20:32.129
A lot more fire extinguishers.

20:32.130 --> 20:34.131
And we put in some built-ins.

20:34.132 --> 20:36.567
With everything a man loves.

20:36.568 --> 20:38.202
Sports.

20:40.705 --> 20:44.241
The armed forces.

20:44.242 --> 20:45.976
We've got tim.

20:45.977 --> 20:47.878
We've got al.

20:52.316 --> 20:55.185
When we were remodeling,
two words came to mind.

20:55.186 --> 20:58.288
Unpaid overtime?

20:58.289 --> 21:00.891
No, al.
Modular design.

21:00.892 --> 21:03.294
Heidi, show them
the new <i>tool time</i> library.

21:03.295 --> 21:07.031
Complete with all the fabulous
classic works of tool history.

21:07.032 --> 21:10.567
<i>A tale of two steam shovels,</i>

21:10.568 --> 21:13.537
<i>Stainless steel magnolias,</i>

21:13.538 --> 21:16.272
<i>David copper pipe.</i>

21:16.273 --> 21:19.810
And behind that unit...

21:19.811 --> 21:22.012
We've got an
all-purpose paint center.

21:22.013 --> 21:25.149
Heidi, why don't you show them
what's behind door number two?

21:25.150 --> 21:27.851
You got your
power tools on one side.

21:27.852 --> 21:30.754
<i>(tim)</i> yeah!

21:30.755 --> 21:34.691
And more power tools
on the other side.

21:34.692 --> 21:37.194
And here's the most
exciting part of our new set.

21:37.195 --> 21:39.963
Our brand-new
interview area.
Heidi!

21:53.077 --> 21:56.380
We can interview guests in
style. Al, be my first guest.

21:56.381 --> 21:58.449
All right.
Thank you, tim.

22:01.152 --> 22:05.121
Mr. Borland, it was tough
getting you on the show due
to your hectic work schedule.

22:05.122 --> 22:09.359
<i>(laughs)</i>
good one, tim!

22:09.360 --> 22:11.762
We'll show a clip
of al's movie.

22:11.763 --> 22:13.864
What was it like making
love with flipper?

22:13.865 --> 22:16.300
That was a great idea, huh?

22:16.301 --> 22:18.202
Let's show that
clip right now.

22:18.203 --> 22:20.704
Al! Al!
Wait a minute!

22:20.705 --> 22:22.772
Get out! Get out!
Al, get out!

22:31.849 --> 22:35.452
Heidi was generous
enough to alternate
her parking space with me.

22:35.453 --> 22:38.255
That's right.

22:38.256 --> 22:42.726
And it's never too soon
to start alternating.

22:42.727 --> 22:45.162
<i>(director)</i>
stand by, on your mark...

22:45.163 --> 22:48.999
False start.
False start. Ok?

22:49.000 --> 22:50.667
And, billy.

22:50.668 --> 22:52.503
On your mark,
get set... Go.

22:54.272 --> 22:57.040
Got a winner?
We'll have to look
at the replay.
