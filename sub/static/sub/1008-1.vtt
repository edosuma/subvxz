01:48.858 --> 01:53.279
[Vevers]  I've always been drawn
to the magic of the ocean.

02:00.078 --> 02:02.872
It feels like time slows down.

02:10.713 --> 02:14.425
Most people stare up into space
with wonder.

02:19.597 --> 02:24.060
Yet, we have this almost-alien world
on our own planet...

02:24.686 --> 02:26.896
just teeming with life.

02:36.114 --> 02:39.200
But it's a world
most people never explore.

02:51.796 --> 02:54.674
[man 1]  Richard Vevers is documenting
the oceans' reefs

02:54.757 --> 02:57.093
the same way Google maps out streets.

02:57.176 --> 02:59.804
[man 2] ...s napping a 360-degree picture

02:59.888 --> 03:01.222
every three seconds.

03:01.472 --> 03:03.892
This is the 21st country that we've done

03:03.975 --> 03:06.269
as part of a global survey of coral reefs.

03:06.352 --> 03:08.646
[man 2]  Hidden below the surface
of the world's oceans,

03:08.730 --> 03:10.523
spectacular gardens of coral.

03:11.024 --> 03:14.527
Reefs are where much
of the seafood we eat begins life.

03:14.611 --> 03:20.408
[man 2]  Reefs are a source of food
and income for over 500 million people.

03:20.491 --> 03:23.536
[Vevers]  It's really about trying
to communicate with science,

03:23.620 --> 03:24.996
as much as doing the science itself.

03:26.581 --> 03:28.374
To take people on a journey.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.251
[man 3]
... that incredible journey under the sea,

03:30.335 --> 03:33.504
which could be the closest many of us come

03:33.588 --> 03:34.756
to seeing an exotic underwater site.

03:34.839 --> 03:38.551
[man 2]  Giving anyone with Internet access
the chance to go on a virtual dive

03:38.635 --> 03:40.637
in many of the survey sites.

04:30.353 --> 04:31.938
[Vevers]  I used to be an ad man.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.942
I spent ten years in advertising,

04:36.025 --> 04:38.361
working at some
of the top London agencies.

04:39.028 --> 04:42.282
Over time, you realize
you're having these conversations about...

04:42.740 --> 04:45.868
toilet rolls, and it's heated debate.

04:45.952 --> 04:48.997
And it's about selling
four-ply toilet tissue

04:49.080 --> 04:50.206
rather than three-ply.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.250
And you go... [sighs]

04:52.750 --> 04:55.753
"I'm sure there's something better
I can be doing with my life."

05:03.177 --> 05:06.097
I've been diving since the age of 16.

05:08.182 --> 05:10.810
I used to go looking
for these weedy seadragons,

05:10.893 --> 05:12.312
which are these incredible animals.

05:13.980 --> 05:17.233
It's like a seahorse,
but it's a dragon about a foot long...

05:18.693 --> 05:20.778
that most people don't even know exists.

05:22.947 --> 05:26.743
But then, one year,
they were all disappearing

05:26.826 --> 05:28.244
from all my favorite sites.

05:29.370 --> 05:32.206
You know, this was one
of my favorite creatures in the world.

05:33.583 --> 05:36.794
And you go, "Well, if it's happening
to one of my favorite creatures,

05:36.878 --> 05:38.379
what else is it happening to?"

05:41.174 --> 05:42.550
And that's when I realized

05:42.633 --> 05:44.802
one of the biggest issues
with the ocean is

05:44.886 --> 05:47.972
it is completely out of sight
and out of mind,

05:48.056 --> 05:50.433
and that, essentially,
is an advertising issue.

05:52.810 --> 05:56.689
You know, when you look at our planet,
it's unique in the known universe

05:56.773 --> 05:59.817
because we've got an ocean
that is the source of life.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.569
And it controls everything.

06:01.944 --> 06:03.279
It controls the weather.

06:03.362 --> 06:04.655
It controls the climate.

06:04.739 --> 06:06.741
It controls the oxygen we breathe.

06:07.742 --> 06:11.454
Without a healthy ocean,
we do not have a healthy planet.

06:12.121 --> 06:14.582
How do you communicate these issues?

06:17.960 --> 06:21.214
The project was called
the XL Catlin Seaview Survey.

06:22.215 --> 06:25.593
What we wanted to do was reveal
the oceans to the world.

06:27.178 --> 06:29.347
People were engaging with the imagery,

06:29.430 --> 06:31.015
they were going for virtual dives,

06:31.099 --> 06:33.476
but they weren't understanding
there's a problem.

06:34.519 --> 06:37.230
So, we had to really go back
to the drawing board...

06:38.147 --> 06:41.442
and I think
that was a shocking realization

06:41.526 --> 06:43.653
that we're only at the start of a journey.

06:46.906 --> 06:49.700
[Dustan] Okay, this one is gonna
be behind, in the back-reef.

06:49.784 --> 06:52.578
-So, what year was this?
-This is 1975.

06:52.662 --> 06:53.746
-Right.
-Okay?

06:53.830 --> 06:55.123
-Yep.
-This whole area back here

06:55.206 --> 06:58.584
-was just thick with  Acropora palmata.
-Right.

06:58.918 --> 07:01.129
-The elkhorn coral.
-And how much is there left?

07:03.131 --> 07:04.382
.01%.

07:04.715 --> 07:05.550
Whoa.

07:05.967 --> 07:07.468
Something like that. You'll see.

07:07.552 --> 07:08.553
-Yeah.
-We'll go see.

07:42.086 --> 07:44.046
[Dustan]  So, you wanna know
what we're looking at.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.967
This flat-- This is all dead reef flat.

07:48.050 --> 07:50.303
This is all dead elkhorn coral.

07:52.305 --> 07:56.058
You can see all the skeletons in place,
but there's nothing alive.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.899
So, this is what the reef looked like
in 1971.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.737
This is all covered with living corals.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.657
This is very typical.

08:11.741 --> 08:13.659
Very, very typical of the Florida Keys.

08:14.243 --> 08:17.121
And 50 years ago, that wasn't the case,

08:17.205 --> 08:18.956
30 years ago, that wasn't the case.

08:19.832 --> 08:20.750
All of it, gone.

08:24.629 --> 08:30.051
[Vevers]  Phil told me that we've lost
80 to 90% of corals in Florida.

08:31.427 --> 08:36.182
I had no idea
that these issues were so advanced.

08:54.033 --> 08:56.577
-I think it might be this one.
-[man] Yep.

08:56.661 --> 08:59.080
-Morning. I'm Richard.
-Jim Porter. Pleased to meet you.

08:59.163 --> 09:00.331
[Vevers]  Very nice to meet you.

09:00.414 --> 09:01.916
Thanks so much for coming down.

09:01.999 --> 09:05.002
[Porter] So, all of this stuff
that I'm showing in here...

09:05.586 --> 09:09.423
um, is from 1976.

09:10.007 --> 09:12.718
-This is Discovery Bay, Jamaica.
-[Vevers] Yep.

09:13.177 --> 09:16.514
And that's what it looked like then.

09:16.597 --> 09:19.058
-And this is a what it looks like now.
-[Vevers] Right.

09:19.225 --> 09:22.061
This survey sat unanalyzed.

09:22.436 --> 09:26.524
Just little bits and pieces,
but not the whole story.

09:27.191 --> 09:30.945
[Vevers]  His imagery was designed
for scientific purpose.

09:31.028 --> 09:34.907
It doesn't capture you instantly
without explanation.

09:35.658 --> 09:37.243
This is what we have lost.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.787
-This is the way it was.
-Yep.

09:40.246 --> 09:43.499
I started my career
in love with a place...

09:44.584 --> 09:47.587
and those places have diminished.

09:48.129 --> 09:52.425
To see that lost is very devastating.

09:54.051 --> 09:57.263
[Vevers]  A lot of scientists I've met
have got really depressed

09:57.346 --> 09:58.180
about this issue.

09:59.140 --> 10:03.644
Whereas I've had the experience
to do ten years in advertising,

10:03.728 --> 10:06.188
where you believe
any problem can be solved

10:06.272 --> 10:08.649
in a ridiculously short period of time.

10:08.816 --> 10:11.319
You just gotta do a bit
of creative thinking.

10:16.574 --> 10:18.868
-That's great. Lovely. Thank you.
-Thank you.

10:19.201 --> 10:21.912
Excuse me. Do you know where Ruth is?
Ruth Gates?

10:22.538 --> 10:25.458
Um, and the classroom's right here.
All those screens go up.

10:26.042 --> 10:27.335
We'll go in and have a look.

10:36.302 --> 10:37.428
[Vevers] Oh, wow.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.139
-Wow.
-[Gates] Is it cool?

10:40.222 --> 10:41.057
Unbelievable.

10:43.267 --> 10:44.268
Wow.

10:44.977 --> 10:47.313
-Okay, um...
-[laughing]

10:48.105 --> 10:50.024
It's the fact that it's moving.

10:50.524 --> 10:52.443
-[Gates] Isn't it amazing that after all--
-Yeah.

10:52.526 --> 10:54.654
[Gates] Twenty-five years
I've been working on corals,

10:54.737 --> 10:56.947
I can look down a microscope
and go, "Bloody hell"?

10:57.031 --> 10:58.824
-I know, that...
-[laughing]

10:59.200 --> 11:02.036
My understanding was this was an animal,
this was an animal.

11:02.119 --> 11:03.412
-Yeah.
-Are they the same animal?

11:03.496 --> 11:05.373
-They are.
-But, um...

11:05.456 --> 11:07.083
I know they're identical animals...

11:07.166 --> 11:08.834
-Yeah.
-...but are they the same?

11:08.918 --> 11:10.294
-They are.
-So, they...

11:10.961 --> 11:12.755
-They are one animal. I--
-Yep.

11:12.838 --> 11:13.964
It's one animal.

11:14.048 --> 11:16.092
Okay, but they're not considered...

11:17.093 --> 11:18.803
I thought polyp was an animal...

11:20.304 --> 11:23.766
not a coral was an animal
with lots of polyps.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.852
-That make sense?
-A coral is an animal with lots of polyps.

11:27.812 --> 11:29.355
But the polyp isn't an animal?

11:30.648 --> 11:32.817
Well... it's part of the animal.

11:33.192 --> 11:35.820
Right. 'Cause this is a--
No one's ever explained...

11:36.237 --> 11:38.030
-what a coral is.
-Your amazement is,

11:38.114 --> 11:39.448
why did you not know that?

11:39.532 --> 11:41.450
-Why didn't I know that?
-I'm stunned.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.369
-And it's the--
-You're a smart guy.

11:43.744 --> 11:45.663
What's wrong with you? [laughing]

11:48.916 --> 11:53.129
I get completely overwhelmed sometimes,
underwater, on a reef.

11:53.379 --> 11:56.632
Because I can't believe
that these structures

11:56.715 --> 11:58.801
are sort of created
by these simple organisms,

11:58.884 --> 12:00.386
or "seemingly" simple organisms.

12:00.469 --> 12:04.265
I have the utmost respect for corals,
'cause I think they've got us all fooled.

12:04.348 --> 12:07.518
Simplicity on the outside
doesn't mean simplicity on the inside.

12:07.893 --> 12:11.063
We think we're really evolved
'cause we're highly complex beings.

12:11.147 --> 12:13.441
We can do lots of things.
We have opposing thumbs.

12:14.108 --> 12:18.070
But corals... they've decided,
"Forget the external complexity.

12:18.154 --> 12:21.991
Let's just be really sophisticated
in a quiet way."

12:23.325 --> 12:26.078
A coral individual is really made up

12:26.162 --> 12:30.791
of thousands of small structures
called polyps.

12:32.126 --> 12:35.921
Each polyp is a circular mouth...

12:36.505 --> 12:38.799
surrounded by tentacles...

12:39.550 --> 12:43.053
and they can combine
to be millions of them

12:43.137 --> 12:44.597
across a single animal.

12:45.764 --> 12:49.894
They have, inside their tissues,
small plants,

12:49.977 --> 12:51.353
these microalgae...

12:51.812 --> 12:53.689
a million per centimeter squared.

12:54.690 --> 12:58.194
The plants that live inside them
photosynthesize,

12:58.277 --> 13:00.488
and the animal uses that for their food.

13:01.113 --> 13:04.492
They essentially have food factories
living inside of themselves.

13:05.367 --> 13:07.077
So, as the animal grows,

13:07.161 --> 13:11.916
what you see is the animal is growing
over the skeleton

13:11.999 --> 13:14.001
and depositing the skeleton underneath it.

13:22.468 --> 13:24.595
They photosynthesize during the day.

13:25.012 --> 13:26.055
At night...

13:26.430 --> 13:29.808
the plant's really essentially asleep
and the animal comes active.

13:29.892 --> 13:32.144
They expand their polyps.

13:32.228 --> 13:33.854
The tentacles come out.

13:33.938 --> 13:37.525
And now anything
that swims by is caught

13:37.608 --> 13:40.986
by these stinging cells
that are on the tips of the tentacles.

13:42.947 --> 13:46.158
There are many different species
of corals,

13:46.242 --> 13:50.454
and the different species of corals
are different shapes.

13:50.538 --> 13:54.166
Some are very boring to look at.
They look like big rocks on the bottom.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.168
Some are incredibly beautiful to look at.

13:56.252 --> 14:00.798
They have huge, huge branching patterns,
or massive plates.

14:01.757 --> 14:04.260
Some of them look like petals of a flower.

14:06.637 --> 14:09.139
These are foundation species.

14:09.640 --> 14:12.226
They have all these other organisms
that depend on them.

14:12.768 --> 14:15.062
They are the reason we have reefs.

14:16.105 --> 14:19.984
A consortium of organisms
that cooperate together...

14:21.694 --> 14:24.530
that now manifests
in this massive structure

14:24.613 --> 14:26.407
that can be seen from space.

14:38.836 --> 14:42.923
[Vevers]  There's a famous reef
in American Samoa called Airport Reef.

14:43.465 --> 14:48.053
We heard that there was an area
where the corals were turning white.

14:49.388 --> 14:52.391
Because we'd been there previously
to do a survey...

14:52.850 --> 14:55.728
we wanted to go back
and take the same images again.

15:09.199 --> 15:11.660
I was truly shocked by what I saw.

15:12.995 --> 15:15.706
The reef was white
as far as the eye could see.

15:18.042 --> 15:21.712
To be honest, I didn't have the knowledge
to know how to process it.

15:22.796 --> 15:23.839
Was this dead?

15:24.340 --> 15:25.382
Was it alive?

15:33.265 --> 15:35.392
This is... Airport Reef.

15:37.561 --> 15:39.104
Before. So, this is in December.

15:43.067 --> 15:44.193
And that's it now.

15:54.203 --> 15:56.330
[Hoegh-Guldberg]
When Richard saw that white coral,

15:56.413 --> 15:57.790
it was a turning point for him.

15:59.792 --> 16:03.087
I think I admitted to him
that I thought this was far more deadly

16:03.170 --> 16:05.464
than some of the other things
that are facing reefs.

16:05.923 --> 16:08.842
And so, what we've seen
since the early 1980s

16:08.926 --> 16:10.177
when this first occurs,

16:10.260 --> 16:12.972
we've actually lost an enormous amount
of coral,

16:13.055 --> 16:14.640
just due to this phenomenon alone.

16:14.723 --> 16:18.268
I think that was the first time
that he saw the enormity of the issue.

16:19.019 --> 16:22.898
That this was a threat across the planet
to coral reefs,

16:22.982 --> 16:27.111
which would happen very quickly
and cause a lot of damage.

16:29.279 --> 16:32.449
Back in the '80s, we started looking
at this weird phenomenon.

16:34.284 --> 16:37.121
Large sections of--
of reefs were turning white,

16:37.204 --> 16:38.747
literally over a couple of weeks.

16:39.373 --> 16:41.417
And no one really knew why this was.

16:44.294 --> 16:46.547
As we did more and more experiments,

16:46.630 --> 16:49.049
it turned out that it wasn't a disease,

16:49.133 --> 16:50.759
it wasn't too much light.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.220
And the only thing you could do
in an experiment

16:53.303 --> 16:55.431
that would cause corals to go white

16:55.514 --> 16:58.892
was to raise the temperature
by two degrees Celsius.

17:01.311 --> 17:03.731
By the end of my PhD,

17:03.814 --> 17:07.067
we were putting cautious words
in the literature saying:

17:07.151 --> 17:09.862
"Well, you know,
maybe this is global warming,

17:09.944 --> 17:12.321
and this is one of the early impacts
on reefs."

17:19.621 --> 17:23.416
[Vevers]  We look at climate change
as if it's an issue in the air.

17:23.500 --> 17:26.002
And you go, "One or two degrees Celsius?

17:26.252 --> 17:27.421
Does that really matter?"

17:28.589 --> 17:30.340
But when you talk about the ocean...

17:30.883 --> 17:33.093
it's like your body temperature changing.

17:33.761 --> 17:38.348
And imagine your body temperature
rises one degree centigrade

17:38.432 --> 17:39.933
or two degrees centigrade.

17:40.476 --> 17:42.561
Over a period of time,
that would be fatal.

17:43.020 --> 17:47.399
And that's the seriousness of the issue
when you look at it in terms of the ocean.

17:50.110 --> 17:54.198
[Gates]  Coral bleaching itself
is a stress response,

17:54.281 --> 17:58.827
much like a fever in humans
is a stress response.

18:00.037 --> 18:03.332
If the temperature spikes just
a little bit above their normal range...

18:04.041 --> 18:06.126
corals will start to bleach.

18:07.002 --> 18:09.171
The small plants
that live inside their tissues,

18:09.254 --> 18:15.469
their ability to photosynthesize
and feed the animal host is impaired.

18:16.011 --> 18:18.847
The animal essentially senses that:

18:18.931 --> 18:22.434
"I've got something inside of me
that is not doing what I expect it to do,"

18:22.518 --> 18:24.728
and as happens with us, with--

18:24.812 --> 18:26.605
When we get a bacteria,

18:26.688 --> 18:28.524
we try to get rid of it
as quickly as possible.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.859
That's exactly what these animals do.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.987
They try to get rid of those plants
that are no longer functional...

18:34.530 --> 18:38.283
and leave behind the transparent,
naked tissue.

18:39.284 --> 18:43.080
They've lost the very most important
food source that they have.

18:43.163 --> 18:44.456
So, it's starting to starve.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.671
[Vevers]  When the coral bleaches,

18:50.754 --> 18:52.631
the flesh becomes clear.

18:52.714 --> 18:55.509
And what you're seeing
is its skeleton underneath.

18:55.759 --> 18:58.345
So, the bright whites
that you see in the pictures...

18:58.846 --> 19:00.722
is just the skeletons everywhere.

19:02.474 --> 19:05.978
[Gates]  If it's a very clean white look
about the coral...

19:06.728 --> 19:08.355
it will still be alive.

19:09.314 --> 19:11.483
It's not allowing anything else
to grow on it.

19:13.360 --> 19:17.322
It will generally not grow.
It will generally not reproduce.

19:17.906 --> 19:19.408
It is likely to die.

19:23.745 --> 19:27.082
You'll see these fuzzy microalgae.

19:28.542 --> 19:33.839
The whole surface suddenly become
much, much fuzzier to look at.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.343
That's an indication that
that coral has died.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.266
[people chattering]

19:44.349 --> 19:46.810
[Vevers] Oh. Can you, uh, mark that one?

19:46.894 --> 19:50.522
Coral bleaching is very difficult
to communicate.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.233
You see a picture
of a beautiful white reef.

19:53.984 --> 19:55.736
Is that a good or a bad thing?

19:57.237 --> 20:00.532
So, we need to communicate it
in a different way.

20:09.958 --> 20:15.380
I was flying on a plane,
and I watched a film,  Chasing Ice .

20:15.464 --> 20:18.717
That film was about the documentation
of the disappearing glaciers.

20:19.468 --> 20:24.473
And it suddenly dawned on me
that we had almost identical projects.

20:24.973 --> 20:28.185
So, pretty much
as soon as I got off that plane,

20:28.268 --> 20:29.686
I contacted the director.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.730
The cameras are shooting every hour,

20:31.813 --> 20:34.608
but we're only showing every,
you know, week or two...

20:34.691 --> 20:38.487
Richard sent an e-mail, out of the blue,
and he attached two photographs,

20:38.570 --> 20:42.115
one of a healthy coral reef
and one of a dead coral reef.

20:42.491 --> 20:45.744
And when I saw those photos,
the light bulb immediately went on.

20:45.827 --> 20:47.996
It's like,
if you can document that change,

20:48.080 --> 20:50.457
you can reveal this to the public
in a powerful way.

20:50.832 --> 20:53.919
We knew from the start there was something
we wanted to get involved with.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.796
These images were chosen...

20:55.879 --> 20:59.800
We started talking pretty early on about
what a time-lapse camera could look like.

20:59.883 --> 21:02.094
But we were missing this one piece.

21:02.177 --> 21:05.430
We needed a wiper system or something
that would keep the glass clean.

21:06.056 --> 21:09.726
When Richard and the team wanted
to do underwater time-lapse,

21:09.810 --> 21:11.937
they approached us to design something.

21:12.354 --> 21:14.856
So, this one is, uh... a little dirty.

21:14.940 --> 21:17.234
[Rago]  We designed a magnetic arm

21:17.317 --> 21:19.987
that pulls a windshield wiper
around this glass dome

21:20.070 --> 21:22.614
and keeps it clean
for long periods of time.

21:22.698 --> 21:25.909
When we first met them,
their deadline seemed absurd.

21:25.993 --> 21:28.704
Nobody's done anything even close to this.

21:29.121 --> 21:32.499
We had all of the issues associated
with just dealing with the time-lapse,

21:32.582 --> 21:36.962
the camera,
but we also had just so many unknowns.

21:41.091 --> 21:43.427
[Rago]  When you have a camera system

21:43.510 --> 21:47.639
that you need to be submerged in saltwater
for months on end...

21:48.557 --> 21:51.727
that is subject to huge storms
and hurricanes...

21:52.811 --> 21:55.689
at depth,
with all the tremendous pressure

21:55.772 --> 21:58.692
of billions of gallons
of water pressing down,

21:58.775 --> 22:01.653
that is very, very difficult to do.

22:01.737 --> 22:04.948
If we're tethered to a BeagleBoard
or Raspberry Pi and SSH in,

22:05.032 --> 22:07.409
I need at least 12 volts.
Probably get away with 11.

22:07.492 --> 22:09.536
Then we could use a 12-to-5
for the Beagle.

22:09.619 --> 22:11.163
-Let's say 300 milliamps.
-Okay.

22:11.246 --> 22:12.414
Twelve minutes a day.

22:12.497 --> 22:14.624
-Seven-point-two watt-hours.
-Yeah.

22:15.125 --> 22:15.959
-Okay.
-Cool.

22:16.043 --> 22:18.003
Well, I think
this is gonna be pretty easy.

22:19.921 --> 22:21.506
[Orlowski]  They're 3D-printing parts,

22:21.590 --> 22:25.969
they're building custom circuit boards,
they're building custom wireless hotspots.

22:26.053 --> 22:27.846
It is really, really complicated.

22:29.139 --> 22:34.519
[Mendelow]  Person in boat wirelessly
connects to a computer in a case

22:34.603 --> 22:37.314
which is hardwired to an umbilical cable

22:37.397 --> 22:41.818
that goes down to a router
inside an underwater housing

22:41.902 --> 22:45.363
that communicates wirelessly
to the camera.

22:46.573 --> 22:48.492
When you're done, you just unplug it.

22:49.826 --> 22:52.162
[Rago]  This is, by far,
the most complicated thing

22:52.245 --> 22:54.873
I've seen built by View Into the Blue.

22:55.582 --> 23:01.046
At the time, Jeff and Richard had no idea
that I was a coral nerd.

23:01.129 --> 23:04.049
Secretly, I'd been sitting in my office,
really stoked

23:04.132 --> 23:08.470
that I was even in the same room
as this project about coral was going on,

23:08.553 --> 23:10.013
and we were helping support it.

23:10.097 --> 23:13.683
Because I wanted more than anything
to do something for the coral.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.685
These are  Lobophyllia.

23:15.769 --> 23:18.522
The chalices are either  Oxypora
or a kind of phylia.

23:18.605 --> 23:22.943
Montastrea, Favites, Favia ,  Platygyra.

23:24.111 --> 23:25.487
That might not be  Platygyra...

23:25.570 --> 23:28.490
I got involved in the aquarium industry
at a pretty young age.

23:29.574 --> 23:31.910
Growing up in the mountains
and in Colorado

23:31.993 --> 23:35.914
actually made my obsession
with the ocean a little bit worse.

23:36.456 --> 23:38.416
See, on this coral, there's a lot of life,

23:38.500 --> 23:41.795
but then there's a lot of, like,
death here, so this is just skeleton.

23:41.878 --> 23:44.256
So, that could very well be
because it got too close

23:44.339 --> 23:46.925
to this  Euphyllia,  perhaps,
they fought with each other,

23:47.008 --> 23:49.344
and this one stung that one to death,
right there.

23:49.427 --> 23:51.096
[Mendelow]  He just loves coral.

23:51.972 --> 23:55.392
Even to the point
where he has coral reef tanks at his house

23:55.475 --> 23:56.476
with no fish in them.

23:56.560 --> 23:59.146
And nobody has coral reef tanks
with no fish in them.

24:00.021 --> 24:03.066
[Rago]  The beauty of coral
or why I enjoy coral more than fish

24:03.150 --> 24:05.152
is because if a coral dies,
it's your fault.

24:05.861 --> 24:09.030
As long as you don't mess up
and, like, crash your tank

24:09.114 --> 24:11.992
or kill that coral,
then they're all gonna continue living.

24:12.075 --> 24:13.577
They're just perpetual machines.

24:13.660 --> 24:16.163
They don't really have a life expectancy,
more or less.

24:16.246 --> 24:18.081
They just kind of continue to go on

24:18.165 --> 24:20.625
as long as their environment
allows them to.

24:21.126 --> 24:22.836
That's the same with jellyfish, too.

24:22.919 --> 24:26.506
Jellyfish technically live forever,
but they just get eaten by so many things

24:26.590 --> 24:27.883
that it just doesn't happen.

24:30.969 --> 24:34.347
For me, the most interesting thing
in nature is symbiosis.

24:35.474 --> 24:40.020
Two separate organisms
that have adapted to each other,

24:40.103 --> 24:42.230
and are now benefiting each other.

24:42.314 --> 24:44.107
They're working together, and...

24:44.816 --> 24:48.737
the first thing that comes to my mind
is an anemone and a clownfish.

24:51.239 --> 24:53.909
The anemone provides protection
for the clownfish,

24:53.992 --> 24:56.870
and the clownfish usually provides food
for the anemone.

24:57.746 --> 25:00.207
It's a mutually beneficial relationship.

25:01.917 --> 25:04.586
In the case of a coral,
it goes deeper than that.

25:06.504 --> 25:10.217
The symbiont itself is incorporated
in the organism.

25:10.300 --> 25:15.263
The coral doesn't exist
without these little tiny plant cells.

25:16.890 --> 25:21.394
They are completely reliant on each other,
and you don't have one without the other.

25:22.020 --> 25:24.981
That relationship
between the two of them is...

25:25.232 --> 25:27.317
the most interesting thing
in the world to me.

26:06.606 --> 26:11.152
Is the color change fairly uniform,

26:11.236 --> 26:12.737
-or does it do this?
-Don't know.

26:12.821 --> 26:13.989
-Don't know.
-Don't know.

26:14.072 --> 26:17.909
- Pocilloporas  could go overnight, right?
-It's never been shot in the wild before.

26:17.993 --> 26:20.328
That's what so thrilling to me
about what's going on here

26:20.412 --> 26:23.498
is that it's gonna be the first time
we'll actually be able to ask that

26:23.581 --> 26:25.166
-and answer that question.
-Yeah.

26:25.250 --> 26:27.836
[Mendelow] But the  Pocilloporas
could go overnight, couldn't they?

26:28.295 --> 26:30.797
[Gates] Yeah, a lot of the  Pocilloporas
have already gone.

26:30.880 --> 26:32.716
-Completely wiped.
-Wiped already.

26:32.799 --> 26:35.468
[Mendelow] But the  Montiporas  are
the important reef-building corals.

26:35.552 --> 26:38.346
Montipora  and  Porites compressa,
yeah, are the two.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.390
And  Lutea,  that big one that you saw. So--

26:40.473 --> 26:42.642
[Mendelow] And what's
the tissue thickness on  Porites?

26:42.726 --> 26:45.353
[Gates] So, they can be down
a half a centimeter.

26:45.437 --> 26:48.315
[Mendelow] Do the ga--?
Do the fertilized gametes carry those...?

26:48.398 --> 26:52.152
[Gates] Yes, 'cause most of them--
In Hawaii, we have a very high proportion

26:52.235 --> 26:53.528
of the coral species that...

26:53.612 --> 26:55.488
[continues indistinctly]

26:57.449 --> 26:59.909
[Vevers]  We knew
this was gonna be incredibly hard,

26:59.993 --> 27:02.412
predicting where to put a camera down.

27:03.330 --> 27:07.417
We thought, "We just need to do this
wherever the bleaching is happening."

27:07.500 --> 27:08.752
[video call ringing]

27:08.835 --> 27:11.588
-Good morning, Mark.
- Good afternoon, Richard.

27:11.671 --> 27:15.467
It's, uh... getting a little depressing.

27:15.550 --> 27:17.385
Yes. And I've read your e-mail,

27:17.469 --> 27:21.014
which was, you know, about the El Niño
starting earlier this year.

27:21.097 --> 27:24.601
Mark Eakin provided us with the tools
to be able to understand

27:24.684 --> 27:25.852
where we should be going.

27:25.935 --> 27:27.312
[Eakin]  What we're looking at is...

27:27.395 --> 27:30.982
I work for the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration or NOAA.

27:31.483 --> 27:34.611
We use satellites
to look at the sea surface temperatures

27:34.694 --> 27:36.029
that cause coral bleaching.

27:36.112 --> 27:39.741
The one thing the temperatures
have shown us, with no question,

27:39.824 --> 27:42.160
is the oceans have been warming.

27:43.578 --> 27:46.664
Temperatures in the ocean
go through normal cycles.

27:46.998 --> 27:49.626
If the temperature were staying constant,

27:49.709 --> 27:54.339
then all those ups and downs
would be around that average temperature.

27:54.923 --> 27:59.469
But now we've reached the point
that we've changed that average.

27:59.552 --> 28:04.432
Your warm temperatures keep getting warmer
and warmer and warmer.

28:05.642 --> 28:11.856
The first widespread bleaching event
occurred in the early 1980s.

28:12.857 --> 28:18.613
'97, '98, this was
the first global-scale mass-bleaching.

28:18.696 --> 28:22.033
A lot of corals bleached,
a lot of corals died.

28:22.659 --> 28:26.204
2010, only 12 years later,

28:26.287 --> 28:30.291
we saw the second
global-scale mass-bleaching.

28:30.959 --> 28:33.878
Now, only five years later...

28:34.879 --> 28:39.509
we've got the potential of the third
global-scale mass-bleaching event.

28:40.051 --> 28:44.055
Basically, at this point, about two-thirds

28:44.139 --> 28:48.268
of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands
are seeing a level of warming

28:48.351 --> 28:50.812
where you're usually seeing bleaching.

28:50.895 --> 28:52.439
The stress levels are high...

28:52.522 --> 28:54.774
[Vevers] I'm zooming in on Hawaii,

28:54.858 --> 28:58.695
and you can see here,
it's 4.7 degrees hotter

28:58.778 --> 29:00.780
than it should be at this time of year.

29:00.864 --> 29:03.992
And you look at some
of the other hotspots around the world,

29:04.075 --> 29:06.745
it's 11.3 degrees, five degrees hotter,

29:06.828 --> 29:09.706
8.2 degrees hotter
than it normally would be.

29:10.290 --> 29:13.418
There's this big heat wave
that's traveling around the planet,

29:13.501 --> 29:15.628
and it's killing corals
wherever it's going.

29:17.589 --> 29:21.509
This is a small window of opportunity
that we've got right now

29:21.593 --> 29:26.014
to be able to capture this bleaching event
and communicate it in a massive way.

29:26.097 --> 29:27.682
There's no plug in here right now.

29:27.766 --> 29:31.227
Normally, we would have done extensive
field-testing with these cameras,

29:31.311 --> 29:32.854
given how complicated they were,

29:32.937 --> 29:34.939
but they just needed
to be put in the water.

29:47.035 --> 29:48.536
[woman]  Well, we have a lot of bags.

29:48.620 --> 29:52.040
I'm not sure how happy
the airport people are gonna be.

29:55.543 --> 29:56.377
[Vevers] One-oh-one.

29:56.461 --> 29:59.255
[Rago] It's fairly watertight
through the exterior.

29:59.839 --> 30:01.966
So, guess what we're up to right now.

30:02.050 --> 30:05.303
We're whittling plastic away
from the underwater solar panel.

30:05.386 --> 30:07.472
[Orlowski]
Otherwise, we can't take it on the plane.

30:09.516 --> 30:10.350
Listen up. Listen.

30:13.603 --> 30:15.522
Ninety-nine-point-five.

30:16.314 --> 30:17.816
-Is that good?
-[indistinct chatter]

30:18.942 --> 30:21.653
[Vevers]  So, based on the data
that we got from NOAA,

30:21.736 --> 30:26.491
we decided to put cameras down
in Hawaii, Bermuda and the Bahamas.

30:29.452 --> 30:32.038
[Ackerman] We'll go down, we'll scout,
we'll find a bunch of spots,

30:32.121 --> 30:33.581
we'll mark the GPS coordinates.

30:33.665 --> 30:35.416
It's right around that corner.

30:53.226 --> 30:56.646
This was completely different
from any other scuba diving I've done.

30:56.729 --> 30:59.148
And any other scuba diving
that one would normally do.

30:59.941 --> 31:01.609
This was construction underwater.

31:03.069 --> 31:06.197
[Rago]  You're working in an environment
that humans weren't built for.

31:07.198 --> 31:09.450
You also can't communicate
with your team,

31:09.534 --> 31:11.911
other than through sign language,

31:11.995 --> 31:13.872
and we are not good at it.

31:14.998 --> 31:17.625
[Orlowski]  So, the camera gets mounted
flush to this. This plate.

31:17.709 --> 31:20.587
We can adjust the height of this
and adjust the angle of this.

31:25.633 --> 31:27.051
[Rago]  You're in zero-gravity.

31:27.468 --> 31:30.680
So, if you're trying to get leverage
to put something into the ground,

31:30.763 --> 31:33.182
you don't have that.
You're floating, you're buoyant.

31:35.310 --> 31:37.020
-[thunder rumbling]
-[warning alarm]

31:37.103 --> 31:40.023
-[woman] Is that thunder?
-[man 1] That's a weather alert.

31:40.106 --> 31:42.066
-I hear a crackling sound.
-[man 1] That's-- Yeah.

31:42.984 --> 31:44.068
[man 2] Is that static?

31:44.444 --> 31:47.280
-I hope that's not lightning--
-[woman] Oh, my God. That's lightning.

31:47.655 --> 31:50.199
-Do you hear that?
-[woman] Yes, I hear it in my microphone.

31:51.117 --> 31:53.536
I think you should probably turn
the cameras off. I don't know.

31:53.620 --> 31:55.788
[woman] Can we get the metal thing down?

31:55.872 --> 31:57.540
[Mendelow] I kind of don't wanna touch it.

32:00.209 --> 32:03.046
[Vevers]
Because of this vacuum-sealed glass dome,

32:03.129 --> 32:06.633
we couldn't actually change
any of the settings inside on the cameras.

32:07.008 --> 32:11.179
So, they attach this wire going to a box
on the boat on the surface.

32:11.429 --> 32:15.183
[Rago]  You have a cable attached
to a stationary device underwater

32:15.266 --> 32:17.894
and it's plugged
into a very delicate piece of equipment.

32:17.977 --> 32:19.020
Boom, we're in.

32:19.604 --> 32:22.440
Now let's see
if this is gonna behave today.

32:22.941 --> 32:26.027
[Ackerman]  And you can sit there
on the boat with a tablet

32:26.110 --> 32:27.779
and you can adjust the settings

32:27.862 --> 32:30.490
and you can see
what the camera is doing underwater.

32:32.241 --> 32:34.869
Um, watch this cable. Are we...?

32:35.411 --> 32:36.704
Can you move us closer?

32:36.788 --> 32:38.206
I'm just nervous--

32:38.289 --> 32:40.625
[woman] The slack is getting too tight!

32:42.377 --> 32:43.211
Hold it.

32:45.630 --> 32:46.506
Hand it down to me.

32:46.589 --> 32:48.216
[thunder crashes in distance]

32:52.929 --> 32:56.015
The wind just took us.
The stern anchor didn't hold.

32:56.557 --> 32:57.684
We're just drifting.

33:11.948 --> 33:12.782
[Rago] Bummer.

33:13.324 --> 33:14.325
[Orlowski] It flooded?

33:16.160 --> 33:17.829
That's gonna go down the cable, too.

33:25.003 --> 33:25.920
Something...

33:31.092 --> 33:33.011
[Mendelow]
All right, so, let's take a look.

33:33.094 --> 33:35.763
So, basically you got a few millimeters
of water in there.

33:35.847 --> 33:37.932
Probably splashed
on an electrical connection,

33:38.016 --> 33:41.227
- blew the 12-volt fuse. You'll be fine.
-[Rago] It did blow the 12-volt.

33:41.477 --> 33:44.689
Here is what that's looking like
at the moment.

33:44.772 --> 33:48.693
We've kind of tore her apart
to access her and attempt to clean.

33:49.277 --> 33:51.571
[Mendelow]
Jiminy Cricket, look at that mess. Okay.

33:52.155 --> 33:53.448
We're gonna be just fine.

33:53.781 --> 33:57.660
I basically would like you to take
12 volts directly from the battery...

34:07.462 --> 34:09.464
All right, let's give this one more try.

34:09.547 --> 34:11.966
All right. Here goes everything.

34:13.092 --> 34:14.719
[Rago]  Do we have a new message?

34:15.803 --> 34:18.389
Oh! [laughing]

34:18.473 --> 34:20.558
We're good. Oh.

34:21.016 --> 34:22.810
Ah! We're connected.

34:23.895 --> 34:24.978
[beeping]

34:25.605 --> 34:28.190
[Mendelow]
That does look killer. Look at that!

34:28.733 --> 34:30.525
That is brilliant, man.

34:31.069 --> 34:33.071
I have a file on my computer.

34:33.821 --> 34:34.822
[Ackerman] Whoo!

34:36.157 --> 34:38.409
-[Mendelow] All right, we're done.
-[Ackerman] What?

34:38.493 --> 34:40.078
-We're done.
-[Ackerman] We're done.

34:42.830 --> 34:44.916
[Orlowski]  Yeah.  [laughs]

34:45.708 --> 34:47.835
[Rago] Oh, I'm so happy right now.

34:49.337 --> 34:50.338
This is awesome.

34:52.632 --> 34:54.842
[Ackerman]  After that,
there was nothing to do but wait.

35:26.499 --> 35:31.546
[Rago]  As a kid growing up, I always
had this sweet spot for taxonomy...

35:32.213 --> 35:35.383
which I don't really know
how to put my finger on that.

35:35.466 --> 35:40.972
I always wanted to know what things were,
and I wanted to know the scientific name.

35:41.055 --> 35:43.975
So, I fell in love with catching
all of these little critters

35:44.058 --> 35:46.144
and coming back
and having a bunch of guides

35:46.227 --> 35:47.937
to help me figure out what they were.

35:48.479 --> 35:51.065
And so, when I got into coral,

35:51.149 --> 35:54.735
there were only a handful of resources
from one guy.

35:55.486 --> 35:56.946
This guy, Charlie Veron.

35:58.906 --> 36:02.160
Every time I was looking something up,
there he was.

36:02.243 --> 36:06.664
There are about 340 species of coral
on the Great Barrier Reef.

36:06.747 --> 36:09.417
There's one just over there
that's about six meters high.

36:11.836 --> 36:15.715
[Rago]  For all intents and purposes,
he's the godfather of coral reef science.

36:16.048 --> 36:19.927
He's the first guy to really go down
and start cataloging corals,

36:20.011 --> 36:24.015
and I wish I could be that guy,
but I was born a little too late.

36:25.474 --> 36:29.353
Here we have thousands upon thousands
of species all interreacting together

36:29.437 --> 36:30.521
in a complex way.

36:31.063 --> 36:34.859
Corals, unlike any other form
of life on Earth, except man,

36:34.942 --> 36:36.986
have the capacity
to build their own environments,

36:37.069 --> 36:39.113
to create their own habitats.

36:42.575 --> 36:43.618
[Gates]  Think of a city.

36:45.703 --> 36:49.457
Corals are experts at creating high-rises.

36:50.875 --> 36:54.462
They're basically creating
this incredible dimensionality,

36:54.545 --> 36:56.172
this three-dimensional framework.

36:57.465 --> 36:59.342
The more complex a structure,

36:59.425 --> 37:02.220
the more biodiversity
can potentially live there.

37:04.305 --> 37:06.057
In a healthy coral reef system,

37:06.140 --> 37:08.768
the entire landscape is covered
with coral.

37:09.769 --> 37:12.730
They're competing for space
with one another,

37:12.813 --> 37:14.732
they grow over and under.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.652
[Hoegh-Guldberg]
Look at Great Barrier Reef,

37:17.735 --> 37:19.654
it's really the Manhattan of the ocean.

37:20.112 --> 37:23.282
This hugely diverse and complex city.

37:23.699 --> 37:26.994
And like in a city, the fish are living
in very specific places.

37:28.871 --> 37:30.539
[Marshall]  It's a bit like a neighborhood.

37:30.623 --> 37:33.417
You go back to a neighborhood
and you see the same people.

37:34.919 --> 37:37.505
The same fish is living
in the same piece of coral

37:37.588 --> 37:38.673
week after week.

37:39.298 --> 37:41.425
They live there
pretty much their entire life.

37:43.052 --> 37:46.514
In the morning and afternoon,
you have traffic on the reef.

37:46.597 --> 37:49.809
You've got fish which have,
like, spent the night on the reef,

37:49.892 --> 37:52.353
and then they go out to feed
and all swim together.

37:53.020 --> 37:55.064
So, they're busy places.

37:57.400 --> 38:00.820
When the sun starts coming up,
you actually have a morning chorus,

38:00.903 --> 38:03.197
similar to what we get
when we hear the birds

38:03.281 --> 38:05.658
waking up in the forest
when the sun comes up.

38:05.741 --> 38:08.619
When you listen closely,
you hear things purring.

38:09.287 --> 38:12.248
You hear the grunts and the groans
of so many different animals.

38:12.832 --> 38:14.417
It's not a silent world at all.

38:14.500 --> 38:15.960
It's actually pretty noisy.

38:17.753 --> 38:21.382
Each fish, each animal, has its own job,
and it does its own thing.

38:22.883 --> 38:24.468
There are fish that farm.

38:24.552 --> 38:26.971
They actually grow little plants or algae.

38:27.263 --> 38:31.976
And they'll go pick a piece of algae
and plant it, and look after that area.

38:32.977 --> 38:34.520
There are crabs and lobsters...

38:34.854 --> 38:37.773
and little shrimps that will do things
like defend corals.

38:38.941 --> 38:40.609
There are strange partnerships,

38:40.693 --> 38:44.155
like moray eels,
which will hunt with coral trout.

38:44.238 --> 38:46.532
Completely different fish,
but they work together

38:46.615 --> 38:48.868
to hunt across the reef,
and they share the meal.

38:50.244 --> 38:53.497
One of the things you notice
is the sort of crunching noise.

38:53.581 --> 38:55.041
And this is the parrotfish.

38:55.124 --> 38:56.834
These are fish that have beaks.

38:56.917 --> 38:59.920
They actually eat the coral.
They're crunching away at the coral.

39:00.671 --> 39:02.923
When that coral passes
through the parrotfish,

39:03.007 --> 39:04.592
it comes out as sand.

39:04.675 --> 39:06.510
So, in fact, every single beach,

39:06.594 --> 39:09.347
you're basically walking
on parrotfish poo.

39:13.392 --> 39:16.270
[Vevers]  Coral reefs are hugely important
for the ocean,

39:16.354 --> 39:18.481
because they're essentially the nursery.

39:18.981 --> 39:23.819
And they say something like 25%
of all marine life relies on coral reefs.

39:25.446 --> 39:28.032
[Eakin]  We've got half a billion
to a billion people

39:28.115 --> 39:32.119
that rely on coral reefs
as their main source of food.

39:33.662 --> 39:37.041
[Porter]  Without that protein,
they're going to be malnourished.

39:37.124 --> 39:39.794
Their culture, their way of life,

39:39.877 --> 39:43.506
their economies are all reliant
on healthy coral reefs.

39:44.465 --> 39:48.803
And many of the new drugs
that are coming to help humans

39:48.886 --> 39:50.596
come from the sea.

39:51.430 --> 39:55.059
There's a drug called prostaglandin
that comes from sea fans,

39:55.142 --> 39:56.394
and that fights cancer.

39:56.894 --> 40:00.898
There's another one called bryostatin
that comes from coral rhizomes,

40:00.981 --> 40:02.650
and it fights cancer, too.

40:03.567 --> 40:05.986
There are so many things
that we don't know yet

40:06.070 --> 40:07.780
that could help society,

40:07.863 --> 40:11.867
through the novel chemistries
that we find on coral reef organisms.

40:14.662 --> 40:17.164
[Eakin]
Coral reefs are producing a breakwater

40:17.248 --> 40:20.292
that's protecting us from big waves,
from cyclones.

40:21.127 --> 40:23.295
They're better than the ones
that we can produce,

40:23.379 --> 40:26.006
because they're growing
and rebuilding it all the time.

40:28.426 --> 40:32.096
[Kleypas]  The corals are the real basis
of that ecosystem.

40:32.972 --> 40:34.807
You can't have a city without buildings.

40:36.392 --> 40:39.395
And you can't have a coral reef
without the corals.

41:04.962 --> 41:07.173
[Rago]  So, we went back to the Bahamas

41:07.256 --> 41:10.259
to retrieve Camera Number 1
after its time.

41:33.073 --> 41:36.494
We're gonna keep our fingers crossed
and hope we have plenty of footage.

41:37.536 --> 41:40.414
Hoping that there's
at least a month and a half.

41:48.589 --> 41:49.548
Bingo.

41:54.512 --> 41:56.138
That's out of focus.

42:01.185 --> 42:03.062
All of these are out of focus.

42:05.356 --> 42:07.149
This is a big bummer.

42:09.652 --> 42:14.031
In focus... and then the first one
after that's out of focus.

42:15.241 --> 42:17.701
And it progressively gets worse.
You see that?

42:19.119 --> 42:21.580
All this footage is out of focus.

42:22.915 --> 42:25.292
And pretty much useless.

42:30.214 --> 42:31.966
I hope they worked elsewhere.

42:53.988 --> 42:55.281
We're out of focus here.

42:57.533 --> 42:58.784
I thought we were okay.

43:00.661 --> 43:01.495
Damn it.

43:04.415 --> 43:06.917
[Orlowski] So, how bad are the images?

43:07.585 --> 43:08.586
Bad.

43:09.420 --> 43:10.546
-Not usable.
-Unusable.

43:10.629 --> 43:12.798
-[Mendelow] Yeah.
-[Orlowski] And so, it's really soft.

43:13.048 --> 43:13.882
[Mendelow] Yep.

43:15.134 --> 43:17.094
There it gets softer and softer
and softer.

43:17.177 --> 43:20.347
[Orlowski] I've never heard
of manual focus changing over time.

43:20.431 --> 43:21.265
[Mendelow] Yeah.

43:25.853 --> 43:27.271
[Vevers]  Hawaii bleached.

43:27.688 --> 43:30.024
It had the worst bleaching it's ever had.

43:30.691 --> 43:32.901
It's just that we didn't manage
to capture it.

43:35.112 --> 43:38.407
We put a lot of effort
getting those cameras down,

43:38.490 --> 43:39.491
and we thought we'd...

43:40.159 --> 43:42.911
we'd done everything right...
and it's a huge knock-back.

43:43.996 --> 43:47.166
More so because we knew
the clock was against us.

43:48.208 --> 43:50.919
We didn't know how long
the bleaching event was gonna last.

43:58.427 --> 44:00.929
[Hoegh-Guldberg] I've been looking
at the latest sea temperature values

44:01.013 --> 44:02.222
for the Australian region.

44:02.306 --> 44:04.808
Definitely warmer than it's been
for quite a while.

44:04.892 --> 44:07.936
That coastal area
is probably gonna continue to warm.

44:08.020 --> 44:08.896
Yeah.

44:08.979 --> 44:11.940
If you're into bleaching... [chuckles]

44:12.024 --> 44:13.651
-this is a good sign.
-Yeah.

44:13.734 --> 44:16.362
Of course,
it means horrible things for the reef.

44:16.445 --> 44:17.529
[man] Beat, 30 seconds.

44:17.780 --> 44:21.909
[Ackerman]  Zack and Trevor went all-in
and just fixed the problems.

44:21.992 --> 44:24.995
-The square that pops up on this...
-[Rago]  We changed to a fixed lens,

44:25.079 --> 44:28.832
and it allowed us to get rid
of all of the focus issues that we had.

44:29.249 --> 44:32.002
We have such a better system going.

44:32.086 --> 44:34.380
I'm much more confident it's gonna work.

44:39.635 --> 44:41.470
Yeah. Yeah.

44:45.516 --> 44:47.810
Awesome! A stingray.

45:00.155 --> 45:02.741
I'm standing on one
of the two and a half thousand or so

45:02.825 --> 45:06.412
enormous platform reefs that make up
Australia's Great Barrier Reef.

45:06.829 --> 45:10.499
Very few people can realize
that this is the largest structure

45:10.582 --> 45:11.834
ever made by life on Earth.

45:13.210 --> 45:16.422
These reefs extend along
the tropical coastline of Australia,

45:16.505 --> 45:19.091
a distance of over 2,000 kilometers,

45:19.174 --> 45:23.220
the length of the entire East Coast
of the United States of America.

45:23.303 --> 45:25.931
[Rago]  I always wanted to go
to the Great Barrier Reef.

45:26.181 --> 45:29.601
I wanna see it for its beauty,
and always wanted to get there.

45:29.685 --> 45:32.187
That's the goal. Always been the goal.

45:41.113 --> 45:43.907
[Orlowski] Dude, you're about to see
the GBR from the air.

45:45.284 --> 45:47.911
That's actually a very exciting thing.

45:54.042 --> 45:57.546
And it's just amazing
to think about how massive it is.

45:59.173 --> 46:00.507
And it's all alive.

46:44.718 --> 46:47.596
[Vevers]  So, we're sending two teams
to the southern Great Barrier Reef.

46:47.679 --> 46:50.390
We're sending Jeff and Zack to Keppel,

46:50.474 --> 46:53.268
and we're sending Andrew and team
to Heron.

47:23.674 --> 47:24.633
[beeping]

47:25.300 --> 47:27.177
[Orlowski]  Camera's in and it's running.

47:28.428 --> 47:31.306
The most smooth
that any of these have gone.

47:31.848 --> 47:33.809
[Ackerman]
It was so much smoother than Hawaii.

47:40.816 --> 47:41.900
[Rago]  And then we waited.

47:43.694 --> 47:46.029
Waited for that warm water to come.

47:48.824 --> 47:52.202
[man]  Already biologists say
some corals are dying,

47:52.286 --> 47:55.789
bleached white,
a sign in the first stage of death.

47:55.872 --> 47:59.585
You're talking... an event similar
to the rain forests of the world

47:59.668 --> 48:02.921
turning white
over a very short period of time.

48:03.005 --> 48:05.757
Everyone would be jumping up
and taking notice,

48:05.841 --> 48:07.551
wondering what the hell is happening.

48:08.302 --> 48:11.763
You may think, "Well, this is just a cycle
that we go through."

48:12.306 --> 48:15.851
Good morning. Coral bleaching in Hawaii
has gained a lot of attention.

48:15.934 --> 48:19.521
-So much that...
-[Vevers]  This isn't a natural cycle.

48:19.605 --> 48:24.276
This is a phenomenon
directly attributed to climate change,

48:24.359 --> 48:27.863
and it's something
that we've only seen in recent years.

48:32.367 --> 48:35.287
[Marshall]  One of the ways
of looking back in time with a reef

48:35.370 --> 48:38.582
is to take coral cores,
or slices through coral.

48:38.665 --> 48:40.459
You can look at growth rings in corals

48:40.542 --> 48:43.003
in the same way as you look
at growth rings in trees.

48:46.256 --> 48:48.884
[Cantin]  You can see a regular,
normal growth pattern.

48:48.967 --> 48:51.178
This coral grows at around

48:51.261 --> 48:53.180
a centimeter and a half per year,

48:53.263 --> 48:55.849
every year, right up until 1998,

48:55.932 --> 48:59.978
where you start to see the signature
of a coral bleaching event.

49:00.812 --> 49:03.774
[Marshall]  By tracking back in time,
by looking at the history of the reef,

49:03.857 --> 49:06.193
we're absolutely certain
that what we're seeing now

49:06.276 --> 49:08.070
is not a natural fluctuation.

49:09.071 --> 49:12.032
The cause is, unequivocally,
global climate change,

49:12.115 --> 49:14.951
driven by emitting carbon
into the atmosphere.

49:16.828 --> 49:19.998
[Hoegh-Guldberg]  I think a lot of people
don't realize climate change is happening

49:20.082 --> 49:23.794
because most of the extra heat trapped
by greenhouse gases

49:23.877 --> 49:25.712
has been transferred to the oceans.

49:27.964 --> 49:32.219
When you burn fossil fuel...
that's burning oil, gas or coal...

49:32.552 --> 49:34.846
carbon dioxide goes up
into the atmosphere.

49:35.681 --> 49:39.184
Carbon dioxide has the property
that it's able to trap heat.

49:40.143 --> 49:42.521
So, the more you have in the atmosphere,

49:42.604 --> 49:45.899
the greater the amount of heat trapped
by the Earth.

49:46.358 --> 49:49.111
It's a bit like putting extra wool
into your sweater.

49:50.112 --> 49:53.240
What people don't know is that 93%

49:53.323 --> 49:56.076
of the heat that's trapped
is going into the ocean.

49:56.702 --> 49:57.911
That's a lot of energy.

49:59.329 --> 50:02.290
If the oceans weren't doing this job
of absorbing the heat,

50:02.374 --> 50:07.504
the average surface temperature
of the planet would be 122 Fahrenheit.

50:10.966 --> 50:14.094
There are rates of change going on
in tropical oceans,

50:14.177 --> 50:16.012
which, if projected forward...

50:16.096 --> 50:19.641
it means that coral reefs
are a likely casualty

50:19.725 --> 50:21.852
of any global climate change.

50:22.519 --> 50:24.604
I published that
in the peer-reviewed literature.

50:25.230 --> 50:28.316
At that point in time,
people weren't quite ready for that,

50:28.400 --> 50:31.862
and I had a lot of colleagues
that were confronting me,

50:31.945 --> 50:33.613
challenging me, attacking me.

50:34.364 --> 50:37.576
[Marshall]  He was ridiculed for this,
for being an alarmist.

50:38.118 --> 50:42.998
But over time he's been proved right,
time and time again.

50:44.583 --> 50:46.585
[Hoegh-Guldberg]  I just love the reef.
That's why I did this.

50:46.668 --> 50:49.004
That's why I came here when I was 18
to this island

50:49.087 --> 50:50.464
and started to study the reef.

50:50.547 --> 50:52.883
It wasn't because I thought
it was gonna disappear

50:52.966 --> 50:56.470
or I was trying to battle a problem
called global climate change.

50:57.262 --> 50:59.890
It's unfortunate
that I can't look at this thing

50:59.973 --> 51:03.143
and still see the beauty.
I see the problems.

51:05.854 --> 51:09.316
This wonderful thing, this thing
that's been around for a very long time...

51:09.691 --> 51:12.277
is threatened,
in our lifetime and on our watch.

51:13.236 --> 51:16.072
And however hard we try to...

51:17.616 --> 51:20.118
to get people to listen, um...

51:20.577 --> 51:23.538
it seems to be lost in the wind, you know?

51:46.520 --> 51:49.940
[Rago]  Storms and the weather is really
the controlling factor right now.

51:50.023 --> 51:53.652
The wind and the storms
continue rolling through,

51:53.735 --> 51:54.945
and we get cloud coverage,

51:55.028 --> 51:57.656
we might not see a whole lot happen
here at Keppel.

51:59.074 --> 52:02.119
[thunder rumbling]

52:04.204 --> 52:05.872
[woman]  Tropical cyclone Winston,

52:05.956 --> 52:10.127
the strongest tropical cyclone ever
recorded in the Southern Hemisphere.

52:10.210 --> 52:12.754
-The big threat going forward...
-[Rago]  For the first time...

52:13.046 --> 52:14.714
we felt we were in the right place
at the right time.

52:15.340 --> 52:19.177
And when Hurricane Winston happened,
all of that changed.

52:19.511 --> 52:22.389
It caused a lot of cold water
and a lot of rain

52:22.472 --> 52:24.474
to come
to the Southern Great Barrier Reef.

52:25.475 --> 52:28.603
Part of me is happy that the corals
aren't gonna bleach here.

52:28.979 --> 52:30.313
Actually makes me ecstatic

52:30.397 --> 52:33.149
to think that they're gonna make it
through this event.

52:33.817 --> 52:36.820
But at the same time,
we've tried so hard to capture this.

52:38.280 --> 52:40.615
We essentially had
to make a difficult decision

52:40.699 --> 52:45.704
to stick to our original plan,
with less-than-ideal odds,

52:45.787 --> 52:49.374
or we go check out some of these
other portions of the Great Barrier Reef

52:49.457 --> 52:50.917
that were getting really warm.

52:52.127 --> 52:54.254
It's all of this to the north
of New Caledonia

52:54.337 --> 52:57.716
and below and even these splotch areas
are at Level 2.

52:58.133 --> 53:02.095
It's just... nothing short of catastrophic
for the coral.

53:03.471 --> 53:06.057
[Orlowski]  We know now
New Caledonia is bleaching.

53:06.683 --> 53:08.268
Lizard Island is bleaching.

53:09.644 --> 53:12.022
I guess it is a simple decision
in some ways.

53:12.105 --> 53:16.151
We should just pick up and move over,
and reset up at those new locations.

53:17.068 --> 53:18.862
The problem is the time-lapse cameras.

53:19.487 --> 53:24.075
It'll take weeks to move those systems,
and we'll have missed the bleaching.

53:26.620 --> 53:28.705
We're gonna have
to figure something else out.

53:31.041 --> 53:34.169
[Ackerman]  I went to turn my computer off,
and there was this message from Jeff,

53:34.252 --> 53:36.338
saying, "How soon can you pack?"

53:38.465 --> 53:41.760
We were gonna abandon
these camera systems...

53:42.719 --> 53:48.224
and do manual underwater
time-lapses every single day.

53:48.308 --> 53:51.311
I think we, as a team,
realized that there was no going back.

53:53.980 --> 53:55.523
[Rago]  We headed up to Lizard Island,

53:55.607 --> 53:58.443
and the other portion of our team
went out to New Caledonia.

54:46.366 --> 54:47.826
It's the most amazing reef.

54:48.076 --> 54:49.953
And it's just demolished.

54:52.872 --> 54:53.957
It's just so hot.

54:55.125 --> 54:57.127
Like, it literally feels like a bathtub.

55:08.096 --> 55:10.098
Anybody order a large Coke?

55:12.267 --> 55:14.728
Here we are talking
about coral reef bleaching

55:14.811 --> 55:16.187
and global climate change...

55:17.022 --> 55:18.481
and here's our other problem.

55:19.774 --> 55:21.860
When we went to Lizard Island,

55:21.943 --> 55:24.195
we didn't have
our time-lapse cameras anymore.

55:24.821 --> 55:27.365
[Orlowski]  The idea is to take one tripod
and one camera,

55:27.449 --> 55:29.868
and get as many shots as we can
in as many positions

55:29.951 --> 55:34.622
of as many pieces of coral as we can,
and to repeat that every single day.

55:34.706 --> 55:38.418
[Rago]  Get on the boat at 9:15,
go out to your first site.

55:40.378 --> 55:43.214
You would find your markings
for the tripod,

55:43.298 --> 55:45.175
put down each leg at the correct heights,

55:45.258 --> 55:49.554
and then you would have reference points
you could then attach the laser beams to,

55:49.637 --> 55:52.766
and then I had a lamination
of the first day's shots.

55:52.849 --> 55:55.060
And then you would take
two minutes of footage,

55:55.143 --> 55:56.936
then you'd pick everything back up,

55:57.020 --> 55:59.230
move onto the next site,
and do the same again.

55:59.314 --> 56:00.732
And then again and again.

56:00.815 --> 56:03.234
And you do that essentially
25 times a day.

56:04.611 --> 56:07.447
Between Jeff and I, we had 60 sites.

56:10.241 --> 56:13.912
The reason we built the time-lapse systems
was it seemed absurd

56:13.995 --> 56:16.748
to have people camped on the beach
at multiple locations

56:16.831 --> 56:19.834
and having to go down
and do what a machine is designed to do.

56:20.627 --> 56:22.170
[Rago]  Logistically, it was a nightmare.

56:22.670 --> 56:26.216
Getting it in the right position,
and you're fighting the current,

56:26.299 --> 56:28.218
so you're getting bounced around a lot,

56:28.301 --> 56:33.098
your knees are bleeding everywhere,
your body is cut up, you're tired.

56:36.601 --> 56:39.437
It got to the point where you're
spending four hours a day underwater.

56:40.063 --> 56:41.689
Weird things start happening.

56:43.983 --> 56:45.610
[Mendelow]  I don't know if it's funny.

56:47.112 --> 56:48.238
It's, uh...

56:48.822 --> 56:50.490
You do what you have to do.

57:35.368 --> 57:38.872
[Vevers]  We were getting reports
that the corals in New Caledonia

57:38.955 --> 57:41.207
were doing something completely weird.

57:44.085 --> 57:47.213
[Ackerman]  Richard was there, he said,
"It's the craziest thing I've ever seen.

57:47.297 --> 57:48.590
I don't know what it is."

57:48.673 --> 57:50.592
The locals didn't know what it was.

57:52.844 --> 57:54.846
We didn't know what was happening.

57:56.139 --> 57:57.390
I asked Richard to explain.

57:57.474 --> 57:59.976
He's like, "Don't know what to tell you.
It's glowing."

58:20.288 --> 58:22.332
[Vevers]  This was different.

58:24.751 --> 58:26.836
The corals were... were fluorescing.

58:29.547 --> 58:34.302
They're producing a chemical sunscreen
to protect themselves from the heat.

58:38.389 --> 58:39.933
You can't even describe it.

58:43.311 --> 58:45.688
They were the most vivid colors
I've ever seen.

59:02.580 --> 59:06.584
This is the most beautiful transformation
in nature.

59:08.211 --> 59:11.047
The incredibly beautiful phase of death.

59:15.093 --> 59:16.886
And it feels as if...

59:17.762 --> 59:20.306
it's the corals saying:

59:20.390 --> 59:21.224
"Look at me.

59:24.185 --> 59:25.228
Please, notice."

01:00:14.527 --> 01:00:16.988
[Ackerman]  We were diving every day
from a floating restaurant.

01:00:19.157 --> 01:00:20.867
[dance music playing over speakers]

01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:24.078
That was kind of funny, the first day.

01:00:27.123 --> 01:00:30.251
Like, that whole thought
just became much more depressing.

01:00:33.546 --> 01:00:34.380
Bit of a shock.

01:00:45.433 --> 01:00:50.438
This is one of the rarest events
in nature happening...

01:00:51.064 --> 01:00:53.358
and everyone's just oblivious to it.

01:00:59.739 --> 01:01:02.992
And you can't blame them for it.
I mean, it's... It's just...

01:01:04.369 --> 01:01:07.372
almost typical of all of humanity.

01:01:09.916 --> 01:01:11.084
This is going on...

01:01:12.085 --> 01:01:13.711
and no one is noticing.

01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:23.096
[Rago]  We designed something originally

01:01:23.179 --> 01:01:26.057
to do this project without emotions.

01:01:26.724 --> 01:01:30.103
And when we began doing this manually
at Lizard Island...

01:01:30.895 --> 01:01:32.480
you have the emotional ties to it.

01:01:32.563 --> 01:01:33.523
You are down there.

01:01:33.606 --> 01:01:35.733
And to sit there for a month,

01:01:35.817 --> 01:01:40.071
and every single day,
watch something new around you die

01:01:40.154 --> 01:01:41.322
that you saw yesterday...

01:01:42.907 --> 01:01:43.825
it's just difficult.

01:02:09.976 --> 01:02:11.894
You forget what it looked like
at the beginning.

01:02:13.146 --> 01:02:16.065
And some days, when you go back,

01:02:16.149 --> 01:02:18.359
and you're sitting down there,
looking at it now,

01:02:18.443 --> 01:02:19.610
and it doesn't look real.

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:24.198
And you-- It's not even--
You can't even accept it.

01:02:28.494 --> 01:02:32.165
And then you open your eyes,
and it's dead as far as you can see.

01:02:56.814 --> 01:02:59.942
It's algae and dead coral skeletons.

01:03:34.894 --> 01:03:38.648
It's flesh.
It's living tissue... that's rotting away.

01:03:45.112 --> 01:03:46.823
It's disgusting, really.

01:04:29.657 --> 01:04:30.658
[sighs]

01:04:38.499 --> 01:04:40.501
I thought we would find bleaching.

01:04:42.128 --> 01:04:43.838
I thought we would capture it.

01:04:44.505 --> 01:04:48.050
But I don't think I ever prepared myself,

01:04:48.134 --> 01:04:50.136
or thought we were gonna see this.

01:05:00.229 --> 01:05:03.774
See, I'm not even mad that I'm leaving,
because it's just so miserable here.

01:05:06.152 --> 01:05:06.986
[sniffles]

01:05:38.976 --> 01:05:40.645
[Marshall]  When coral bleaches and dies...

01:05:41.312 --> 01:05:42.772
you're losing the coral animal.

01:05:43.022 --> 01:05:45.358
And that's a shame,
'cause it's a beautiful thing.

01:05:45.441 --> 01:05:50.529
But a coral is... a fundamental part
of a huge ecosystem.

01:05:51.238 --> 01:05:54.033
It is, in a way,
just like the trees in a forest.

01:05:54.825 --> 01:05:57.828
If coral reefs are lost,
we're affecting the life

01:05:57.912 --> 01:05:59.163
of a quarter of the ocean.

01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:03.250
If the little fish disappear,
the big fish disappear,

01:06:03.334 --> 01:06:05.836
and then you can look at humans
as one of the big fish.

01:06:10.299 --> 01:06:14.303
[Porter]  It's easy to think about the fate
of an individual species.

01:06:15.763 --> 01:06:18.641
But what is a little harder to explain...

01:06:19.058 --> 01:06:23.354
it's the beginning
of an ecological collapse

01:06:23.437 --> 01:06:25.272
of the entire ecosystem.

01:06:26.232 --> 01:06:29.485
It's more than the species,
the genus, the family, the order.

01:06:30.152 --> 01:06:35.491
We're talking about the possibility
that entire classes of organisms

01:06:35.574 --> 01:06:37.284
would go extinct.

01:06:40.371 --> 01:06:42.915
[Hoegh-Guldberg]  When scientists say
they're researching climate change

01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:44.458
and coral reefs,

01:06:44.542 --> 01:06:47.420
it's not about whether or not
climate change is happening or not.

01:06:47.503 --> 01:06:48.754
It's really the uncertainty

01:06:48.838 --> 01:06:53.009
between knowing whether
it's going to be bad or really bad.

01:06:54.301 --> 01:06:57.471
When we look at ocean temperatures,
there are a range of projections

01:06:57.555 --> 01:07:00.016
of how they're gonna change
into the future.

01:07:00.099 --> 01:07:03.894
If you take the average,
in about 25 years,

01:07:03.978 --> 01:07:05.354
all across the planet,

01:07:05.438 --> 01:07:10.067
the oceans become too warm
for coral reefs to survive.

01:07:10.609 --> 01:07:12.278
That means they'll bleach every year

01:07:12.361 --> 01:07:14.363
and they won't be healthy enough
to recover.

01:07:15.406 --> 01:07:19.493
Coral reefs will not be able to keep up,
they will not be able to adapt,

01:07:19.577 --> 01:07:24.248
and we will see the eradication
of an entire ecosystem

01:07:24.331 --> 01:07:26.250
in our lifespan.

01:07:27.376 --> 01:07:30.379
That is a very gloomy statement.

01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:33.132
But, unfortunately, it is true.

01:07:35.801 --> 01:07:38.804
[Hoegh-Guldberg]
Everything on our planet is connected.

01:07:39.889 --> 01:07:43.642
What we're doing is pulling out the card
called "coral reefs"

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:45.311
from this house of cards.

01:07:46.103 --> 01:07:49.106
And the real fear is that
we'll take out enough of those cards

01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:51.358
where the whole thing
will just simply collapse.

01:07:53.235 --> 01:07:55.196
[Kleypas]
If we can't save this ecosystem...

01:07:56.572 --> 01:08:00.409
are we gonna have the courage
to save the next ecosystem down the line?

01:08:02.453 --> 01:08:03.704
[Dustan]  Do we need forests?

01:08:05.706 --> 01:08:06.916
Do we need trees?

01:08:08.584 --> 01:08:09.794
Do we need reefs?

01:08:12.171 --> 01:08:15.508
Or can we just sort of live
in the ashes of all of that?

01:08:35.027 --> 01:08:36.654
[Orlowski] So, tell me where we're going.

01:08:36.737 --> 01:08:39.740
[Rago] We're actually just going
to Charlie Veron's house.

01:08:40.825 --> 01:08:43.786
Used to literally sit behind a desk
for hours a day

01:08:43.868 --> 01:08:48.040
using Charlie Veron's coral lists
to ID things.

01:08:48.124 --> 01:08:49.457
Like... he was the boss.

01:08:49.542 --> 01:08:52.920
He was the information
that I used on a daily basis

01:08:53.002 --> 01:08:55.673
to learn everything that I know of corals.

01:08:56.006 --> 01:09:00.051
And now, I'm about to go sit
in his living room and interview him.

01:09:00.886 --> 01:09:03.055
So, that's quite a big step.

01:09:06.392 --> 01:09:07.309
-Hello.
-[Veron]  Hello.

01:09:07.393 --> 01:09:08.894
-Charlie.
-How are you? I'm Zack.

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:10.062
Pleasure to meet you.

01:09:13.566 --> 01:09:14.441
[dog barks]

01:09:21.031 --> 01:09:22.283
[groans]

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.788
While I was in college
studying evolutionary biology,

01:09:28.872 --> 01:09:30.541
I actually got a job at an aquarium.

01:09:30.624 --> 01:09:33.085
And so, for five years, I grew coral,

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:37.006
used all of your work to teach myself
as much of coral taxonomy

01:09:37.089 --> 01:09:38.549
-as I possibly could.
-Oh, okay.

01:09:38.631 --> 01:09:41.010
So, I was very nervous about it--
Coming here, so--

01:09:41.093 --> 01:09:43.261
I'm not the sort of person
to be nervous about.

01:09:43.345 --> 01:09:44.470
No, not at all, but--

01:09:44.555 --> 01:09:46.515
-Yeah.
-I guess I just wanna hear

01:09:46.599 --> 01:09:49.894
your perspective of the change
that you've seen over time.

01:09:50.810 --> 01:09:54.607
Then it was...
it was a totally different mindset,

01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:58.360
because the reef was there forever,
there was no question about it.

01:09:58.444 --> 01:09:59.528
-Yeah.
-I even wondered

01:09:59.612 --> 01:10:02.031
why you would wanna make it a marine park.

01:10:02.114 --> 01:10:04.950
It's so big, nothing's gonna touch
the Great Barrier Reef.

01:10:05.034 --> 01:10:06.577
But it's changed enormously.

01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:10.414
And this bleaching
and the degrading of the Great Barrier

01:10:10.497 --> 01:10:12.249
that I've seen in my lifetime...

01:10:13.542 --> 01:10:14.543
it really upsets me.

01:10:14.627 --> 01:10:18.589
Up at Lizard, we essentially have
fluorescing or bleached corals

01:10:18.672 --> 01:10:21.634
going through their transition to death,
being covered in algae.

01:10:21.717 --> 01:10:24.053
You covered the whole thing.
Yeah, way to go.

01:10:24.136 --> 01:10:26.639
Yeah, the whole horrible,
horrible, ghastly mess.

01:10:26.931 --> 01:10:29.975
Yeah. It was actually quite difficult
while we were up there.

01:10:30.059 --> 01:10:34.021
I got quite frustrated a few times where
I just didn't wanna be there anymore.

01:10:34.104 --> 01:10:35.648
I didn't wanna watch it anymore.

01:10:35.731 --> 01:10:36.941
I was over it. And...

01:10:37.983 --> 01:10:40.152
I'm glad I'm not your age.

01:10:41.362 --> 01:10:43.405
You know, I'm ready to check out when--

01:10:43.489 --> 01:10:46.784
when the Great Barrier Reef gets trashed,
'cause it's been the most...

01:10:47.409 --> 01:10:49.703
loved thing
in the physical world of my life.

01:10:50.079 --> 01:10:52.873
You know, I've been diving on it
for 45 years.

01:10:52.957 --> 01:10:56.543
And I'm damned if I'm ever gonna stop
until I go completely senile.

01:10:56.627 --> 01:10:57.836
[laughs]

01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:58.963
I'm gonna keep going,

01:10:59.046 --> 01:11:01.382
and as long as I can influence people,
I will.

01:11:01.465 --> 01:11:02.967
-Because we have to.
-Absolutely.

01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:05.552
We've got no choice.
You've got no choice, I'm afraid.

01:11:05.636 --> 01:11:07.721
-You've gotta keep at it. You've got to.
-Yep, yep.

01:11:08.305 --> 01:11:11.475
Otherwise, you're not gonna like yourself
when you're an old man.

01:11:11.558 --> 01:11:14.228
You'll think...
You're gonna like yourself much more...

01:11:14.812 --> 01:11:17.898
if you can say,
"Well, I sure tried to turn that around.

01:11:17.982 --> 01:11:21.026
And maybe I did influence people
here and there and..."

01:11:22.653 --> 01:11:24.697
Don't let a-- Don't let anything stop you.

01:11:27.783 --> 01:11:29.201
[speaking indistinctly]

01:11:32.413 --> 01:11:33.956
Just gotta get my glasses.

01:11:39.795 --> 01:11:44.174
[Vevers]  Losing the Barrier Reef
has actually gotta mean something.

01:11:45.342 --> 01:11:49.596
You can't let it just die,
and it becomes an old textbook.

01:11:51.098 --> 01:11:57.104
It's got to... cause the change
that it deserves.

01:11:57.521 --> 01:12:01.567
Us losing the Great Barrier Reef
has got to wake up the world.

01:12:03.861 --> 01:12:06.280
[Hoegh-Guldberg]
We have a really interesting situation.

01:12:06.363 --> 01:12:08.949
Over the next 30 years,
we're going to be facing

01:12:09.033 --> 01:12:11.618
shifting ocean temperatures
and conditions.

01:12:11.702 --> 01:12:16.165
And that's just a matter of fact,
because we've got point-five...

01:12:19.543 --> 01:12:21.879
[Vevers]
I usually get to these things and...

01:12:22.838 --> 01:12:25.049
and you start kind of almost shaking.

01:12:25.132 --> 01:12:28.177
[Rago] I definitely have a little bit
of nervousness going.

01:12:29.136 --> 01:12:31.305
How much talking is too much talking?

01:12:31.388 --> 01:12:33.932
Is getting personal a bad thing?

01:12:34.516 --> 01:12:38.687
Like, "This one was one of the more
difficult sites for me to go back to."

01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:43.025
[Vevers] Really good to show
that it actually affected you.

01:12:43.108 --> 01:12:44.651
-[Rago] Right.
-That's really important.

01:12:45.444 --> 01:12:47.404
Um, and good. Um...

01:12:47.488 --> 01:12:49.406
-As long as you don't start crying.
-Yeah.

01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:50.324
[Vevers] Yeah.

01:13:02.878 --> 01:13:04.880
So, over the last two years,

01:13:04.963 --> 01:13:08.384
we've been amassing
a huge amount of bleaching imagery

01:13:08.467 --> 01:13:09.676
from all over the world.

01:13:10.010 --> 01:13:12.179
Now Zack's gonna show you
some of that imagery.

01:13:12.721 --> 01:13:14.306
So, if you wanna pop up, Zack.

01:13:18.102 --> 01:13:21.146
We spent the last four months
in Australia

01:13:21.230 --> 01:13:23.565
and we documented
the ongoing bleaching event.

01:13:24.108 --> 01:13:27.528
And so, I wanted to just show you
what our team was able to document.

01:14:38.265 --> 01:14:39.641
[Rago]  In just two months,

01:14:39.725 --> 01:14:43.103
we've lost the majority of fish life
on this coral colony.

01:15:17.513 --> 01:15:19.139
The soft corals disintegrate.

01:15:20.557 --> 01:15:22.518
Fields and fields of soft coral

01:15:22.601 --> 01:15:25.062
that then just turns
into a barren rock face.

01:15:28.106 --> 01:15:29.775
I didn't even think it was possible.

01:17:12.794 --> 01:17:16.256
[Vevers]  This has been a mortality event
on a massive scale.

01:17:18.175 --> 01:17:22.179
29% of the corals
on the Great Barrier Reef alone have died.

01:17:24.556 --> 01:17:29.436
To lose 29% of the coral animals
in a single year,

01:17:29.519 --> 01:17:33.565
it's just mind-blowing,
the scale of this bleaching event.

01:17:38.236 --> 01:17:41.490
I think the most shocking part
was how widespread it was.

01:17:42.032 --> 01:17:44.576
'Cause it affected almost all the reefs

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:47.746
from Lizard Island
north through Torres Strait.

01:17:48.372 --> 01:17:49.289
And it was severe.

01:17:51.249 --> 01:17:53.752
It's the equivalent of losing
most of the trees

01:17:53.835 --> 01:17:56.046
between Washington, DC, and Maine.

01:17:58.173 --> 01:18:00.342
[Rago]  Well, this isn't just
the Great Barrier Reef.

01:18:00.842 --> 01:18:03.845
This is a global massive event.

01:18:04.596 --> 01:18:09.017
There are a large number of places
that are experiencing bleaching right now.

01:18:09.101 --> 01:18:10.394
And that's why we need help.

01:18:10.477 --> 01:18:13.063
We're looking for people
who have access to a local reef

01:18:13.146 --> 01:18:16.358
to help photograph
what's happening in your own backyard.

01:18:16.608 --> 01:18:19.736
If you are a diver, please,
join our effort and get in touch...

01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:22.489
[Rago]  Everybody's come together
that saw our call-out.

01:18:23.281 --> 01:18:26.076
At this point,
we are on the bleaching threshold

01:18:26.159 --> 01:18:28.912
and under a warning alert for bleaching.

01:18:28.995 --> 01:18:32.165
Behind me, you can see
we have the Akumal reefs.

01:18:32.249 --> 01:18:36.920
Basically, we've seen...
that one is almost completely bleached.

01:18:37.003 --> 01:18:43.468
Water temperature has been rising,
and the coral has been bleaching.

01:18:43.552 --> 01:18:46.054
[Rago]  You're talking about the Caribbean,
two years in a row,

01:18:46.138 --> 01:18:47.639
about Hawaii, two years in a row.

01:18:47.723 --> 01:18:50.350
This last summer was especially horrific.

01:18:50.434 --> 01:18:54.604
25 to 50% of the coral
is already long-since dead.

01:18:54.688 --> 01:18:58.275
We know the waters here
started warming up in May, 2015,

01:18:58.358 --> 01:19:00.986
to about three degrees Celsius
above normal.

01:19:01.069 --> 01:19:05.657
Most of the  Acropora,
the most common branch corals, are dying.

01:19:05.741 --> 01:19:09.202
[speaking Bislama] The climate is still
changing. The ocean temperature is rising.

01:19:09.286 --> 01:19:13.832
The El Niño this year
has bleached what's left.

01:19:14.916 --> 01:19:16.710
[speaking English] Reefs here
have been under major stress,

01:19:16.793 --> 01:19:20.464
-like other places across the globe.
-We're here in the Republic of Palau.

01:19:20.547 --> 01:19:22.674
I'm in Cebu City, and...

01:19:22.758 --> 01:19:25.260
The corals have been bleached
over the past month.

01:19:25.343 --> 01:19:30.140
The coral is 75% bleaching,
and about half of them is dead already.

01:19:30.223 --> 01:19:34.019
We now have a mass coral bleaching event
happening here on Christmas Island.

01:19:34.102 --> 01:19:35.520
...degrees centigrade.

01:19:35.604 --> 01:19:38.064
A lot of the reefs around Sri Lanka
were heavily bleached.

01:19:38.148 --> 01:19:40.650
Bleaching is happening right now.

01:19:40.734 --> 01:19:42.903
The coral are showing
massive signs of bleaching,

01:19:42.986 --> 01:19:45.113
and for that reason,
we have massive mortality rates.

01:19:45.197 --> 01:19:46.531
We've found the branch--

01:19:46.615 --> 01:19:50.076
Branching Arcoporas,  Pocilloporas
have started to show signs of bleaching.

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:53.246
I've been helping capture images
of coral bleaching in the Red Sea.

01:19:53.330 --> 01:19:55.499
Bleaching has occurred here, recently.

01:19:55.582 --> 01:19:57.709
Uh, there was a bleaching event...

01:19:57.793 --> 01:20:00.045
[overlapping reports]

01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:19.898
[Veron]  I get cross with myself...

01:20:20.398 --> 01:20:22.192
because I don't think I did enough.

01:20:22.275 --> 01:20:26.196
I didn't make enough noise
when I realized what was happening.

01:20:26.279 --> 01:20:27.739
I didn't do enough.

01:20:27.823 --> 01:20:28.865
Better at it than I am.

01:20:29.241 --> 01:20:31.952
[Veron]  Zack has an option
of being part of that fight.

01:20:34.204 --> 01:20:36.665
Maybe Zack will say, "Charlie...

01:20:37.207 --> 01:20:39.292
he's just a gloomy old man,

01:20:39.376 --> 01:20:41.837
and, uh... we can fix these things."

01:20:42.212 --> 01:20:43.338
-[man] All good?
-Yeah.

01:22:00.290 --> 01:22:02.042
[Rago]  How are you guys doing today?

01:22:02.125 --> 01:22:03.919
-[kids] Good.
-Are you guys excited?

01:22:04.169 --> 01:22:05.045
[kids] Yeah.

01:22:05.128 --> 01:22:06.588
[Rago] Let's go diving.

01:22:07.130 --> 01:22:08.256
[kids] Diving!

01:22:09.549 --> 01:22:11.051
[kids chattering]

01:22:11.134 --> 01:22:12.302
[kid 1] I see a fish.

01:22:12.844 --> 01:22:14.846
[kids chattering]

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:16.598
-[Rago]  Take a look around.
-[kid 2]  I see a turtle.

01:22:16.681 --> 01:22:18.433
-[kid 3]  I see a turtle.
-[kid 4]  I see a turtle.

01:22:20.352 --> 01:22:22.729
[Rago]  In my mind,
all kids are born scientists.

01:22:22.812 --> 01:22:24.356
They're born adventurers.

01:22:24.439 --> 01:22:25.482
They wanna explore.

01:22:26.358 --> 01:22:29.694
If we can get the kids
to hold on to that curiosity,

01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:32.822
then our planet would be
a much better place.

01:22:32.906 --> 01:22:35.492
I could-- I could see a stingray.

01:22:36.451 --> 01:22:38.828
-[kid 5]  What is that?
-[Rago]  Turtles, fish, coral,

01:22:38.912 --> 01:22:41.706
crabs, starfish.
You name it. It's all there, right?

01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:43.208
[chatter continues]

01:22:43.583 --> 01:22:45.418
We're gonna take you on an expedition

01:22:45.502 --> 01:22:47.587
to go see
the third global bleaching event.

01:22:47.837 --> 01:22:50.382
I think having been on the journey
that I've been on,

01:22:50.465 --> 01:22:53.093
I should be the most depressed person
on the planet.

01:22:53.176 --> 01:22:54.511
I'm seeing the ecosystem

01:22:54.594 --> 01:22:56.262
that I've fallen in love with...

01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:58.014
die before my eyes.

01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:02.018
Having said that,
I'm not actually depressed.

01:23:03.645 --> 01:23:05.939
And that's because
there's been a big shift.

01:23:07.065 --> 01:23:09.734
You look at every piece
of climate change action,

01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:12.696
and it's about improving people's lives.

01:23:13.363 --> 01:23:17.993
Creation of jobs, reducing pollution,
greenifying cities.

01:23:18.326 --> 01:23:23.289
It's essentially a great transformation
that is already beginning.

01:23:24.666 --> 01:23:26.501
[Hoegh-Guldberg]
It's not too late for coral reefs,

01:23:26.584 --> 01:23:28.253
indeed, for many other ecosystems

01:23:28.336 --> 01:23:30.505
that are facing challenges
from climate change.

01:23:31.089 --> 01:23:34.926
It's still possible to reduce the rate
at which the climate is changing.

01:23:35.885 --> 01:23:37.387
And that's within our power today.

01:23:39.347 --> 01:23:40.515
[Vevers]  It's all achievable.

01:23:41.182 --> 01:23:44.769
It's not like we don't have the money,
not like we don't have the resources.

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:47.147
It's not like we don't have the brains.

01:23:48.815 --> 01:23:51.443
This is inevitable,
this great transformation,

01:23:51.526 --> 01:23:54.070
and that's what makes me
so optimistic is...

01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:56.406
all we gotta do
is give it a bit of a shove.
