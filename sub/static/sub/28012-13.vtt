00:01.335 --> 00:03.871
Free the innocent.
Find the guilty.

00:03.904 --> 00:06.716
- Are you sure you want to poke the bear?
- I want to rip his heart out.

Only on Fox.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.019
Previously on Proven Innocent...

00:19.053 --> 00:20.097
Madeline Scott,
you are under arrest

00:20.121 --> 00:21.922
for the murder
of Rosemary Lynch.

00:21.955 --> 00:23.833
If you can connect this lantern
to Madeline Scott,

00:23.857 --> 00:25.493
you'll win by a landslide.

00:25.526 --> 00:26.994
Ravi was possibly a murderer.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.663
After Rosemary's death,
all evidence vanishes.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.175
Only supporting the theory
that he's dead.

00:31.199 --> 00:33.334
Sarah, I know
this is a lot to ask.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.879
- We're hoping you'll testify to all of this.
- Glad I can finally help.

00:35.903 --> 00:38.005
- Linda, I need you to testify.
- I'll testify.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.117
You shouldn't have let my
sister get anywhere near him.

00:40.141 --> 00:42.410
I think I deserve to see my son.

00:42.443 --> 00:44.678
- He's got nothing.
- I've got everything.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.480
I've got Levi.

00:53.087 --> 00:55.055
We are now 100% sure we have

00:55.089 --> 00:56.890
the weapon Madeline Scott used

00:56.924 --> 00:58.192
to murder Rosemary Lynch.

00:58.226 --> 00:59.793
Justice...

00:59.827 --> 01:01.962
will finally be served.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.567
What do you fear most?

01:07.568 --> 01:09.370
For those wrongfully accused,

01:09.403 --> 01:12.873
their biggest fear
is hearing the word "guilty."

01:12.906 --> 01:15.743
That one simple word

01:15.776 --> 01:17.645
can take away
your precious freedom

01:17.678 --> 01:21.382
and condemn you to prison
for the rest of your life.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.083
On this week's episode

01:23.117 --> 01:24.885
of Until Proven Innocent,
we'll discuss

01:24.918 --> 01:27.888
what happens when that fear
hits close to home.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.424
When the freedom
at stake belongs

01:30.458 --> 01:31.759
to someone you love.

01:31.792 --> 01:34.094
Madeline Scott is on trial

01:34.128 --> 01:36.897
for the murder of Rosemary Lynch

01:36.930 --> 01:38.832
and she is an innocent woman.

01:38.866 --> 01:42.403
So, my coworkers and I
have been transformed

01:42.436 --> 01:44.905
from legal advocates
to those suffering

01:44.938 --> 01:46.940
right alongside
the wrongfully accused.

01:46.974 --> 01:49.477
And we will continue fighting

01:49.510 --> 01:51.579
with every ounce
of strength that we have

01:51.612 --> 01:54.748
because we have seen how,
in an instant,

01:54.782 --> 01:56.350
your freedom can vanish.

01:56.384 --> 01:57.685
And I know

01:57.718 --> 01:59.853
that in the depths of my soul,

01:59.887 --> 02:02.790
I would be lost
without Madeline Scott, so...

02:04.158 --> 02:06.760
I am scared to death
of losing my best friend.

02:08.795 --> 02:10.130
How'd it go with Sarah?

02:10.163 --> 02:12.366
I need to review
the cult timeline with her.

02:12.400 --> 02:13.801
- How about Linda?
- Well, she's got

02:13.834 --> 02:16.136
some interesting details
on this Ravi character.

02:16.170 --> 02:18.606
Aka Robert Carter,
deceased con man,

02:18.639 --> 02:21.609
cult leader and, serial rapist.

02:21.642 --> 02:24.212
And our best option
for an alternative suspect.

02:24.245 --> 02:26.680
We may not even
have to present a case.

02:26.714 --> 02:29.283
We might be able
to knock out Bellows' case

02:29.317 --> 02:31.118
on lack of sufficient evidence.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.297
- You really believe that?
- Well, it's not impossible.

02:33.321 --> 02:34.622
What does Bellows really have?

02:34.655 --> 02:37.024
A lantern with no hair, fibers,

02:37.057 --> 02:39.627
fingerprints...
unreliable witnesses.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.462
Heather "Bitch" Husband.

02:41.495 --> 02:44.298
Who I'll decimate on cross.
I got this.

02:44.332 --> 02:46.033
What do we do about Levi?

02:46.066 --> 02:48.636
Bellows has had him alone
and incommunicado for a week.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.404
What if he got to him?

02:50.438 --> 02:52.139
What if he threatened him
and he flipped?

02:52.172 --> 02:53.650
You really think
your own brother's gonna lie

02:53.674 --> 02:55.042
to implicate you for murder?

02:55.075 --> 02:56.977
Hey, either Levi
tells the truth and testifies

02:57.010 --> 02:58.812
you didn't do it,
or I'll expose his lies

02:58.846 --> 03:00.881
and go after Bellows
for suborning perjury.

03:02.216 --> 03:03.251
We're ready.

03:05.519 --> 03:08.155
What do you think
Levi's gonna say?

03:08.188 --> 03:11.492
I have absolutely no idea.

03:11.525 --> 03:14.428
Day one of the retrial
of Madeline Scott,

03:14.462 --> 03:17.698
only this time she's being tried
without her brother Levi,

03:17.731 --> 03:19.567
who some say has
turned against his sister

03:19.600 --> 03:22.403
as the prosecution's
star witness.

03:22.436 --> 03:25.573
Madeline,
how does it feel to know

03:25.606 --> 03:27.851
- that your own brother has betrayed you?
- How does it feel

03:27.875 --> 03:29.919
- to be a two-faced, lying hag?
- We have no comment.

03:29.943 --> 03:31.955
Getting scared now that a guilty
verdict is finally on the way?

03:31.979 --> 03:33.957
You know... Do you have any idea
how much damage you do

03:33.981 --> 03:36.083
with your hyped-up coverage
and sensationalism?

03:36.116 --> 03:38.386
This is an actual life
that you are destroying

03:38.419 --> 03:40.954
for an extra half-point
of ratings on a crappy show.

03:40.988 --> 03:42.923
All right, like I said,
we have no comment.

03:42.956 --> 03:46.193
Madeline Scott,
clearly under pressure.

03:46.226 --> 03:49.763
Entering the courtroom now is
State's Attorney Gore Bellows.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.941
- Mr. Bellows.
- Don't have anything for you right now, Susan.

03:51.965 --> 03:53.534
Gore...

03:53.567 --> 03:54.835
get her.

03:56.000 --> 04:02.074

04:18.459 --> 04:20.127
We were a couple hours
into the mission,

04:20.160 --> 04:22.430
off the southeast shore
of Cathedral Cove,

04:22.463 --> 04:24.965
when the submersible picked up
a metallic object

04:24.998 --> 04:26.800
at approximately 20 feet,

04:26.834 --> 04:28.802
some dozen yards offshore.

04:28.836 --> 04:31.004
And what was the object
you found?

04:31.038 --> 04:33.474
It was a common camping lantern.

04:33.507 --> 04:36.176
The two dented spots
on the lantern precisely matched

04:36.209 --> 04:38.346
the wounds
that killed Rosemary Lynch.

04:38.379 --> 04:41.281
Also, the metallic shards

04:41.315 --> 04:42.850
found in the brain
of the deceased

04:42.883 --> 04:44.017
match the lamp's metal.

04:44.051 --> 04:47.355
The lantern belonged
to Madeline.

04:47.388 --> 04:49.357
And how can you be sure of that,
Mrs. Husband?

04:49.390 --> 04:51.992
Well, for one thing,
it was old, even then.

04:52.025 --> 04:54.294
So, when I saw her carrying it,
I made a joke

04:54.328 --> 04:56.797
- about how gross it was.
- And this discussion

04:56.830 --> 04:59.166
happened on the night
Rosemary Lynch was murdered?

04:59.199 --> 05:00.468
Yes.

05:00.501 --> 05:02.803
She was walking with it
when we talked.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.672
Any idea where she was headed?

05:04.705 --> 05:07.708
Right to the spot
where Rosemary was found.

05:07.741 --> 05:10.010
She was acting so strange,

05:10.043 --> 05:11.545
like... I don't know,

05:11.579 --> 05:13.714
maybe she was on drugs
or something.

05:13.747 --> 05:16.950
The next thing I saw
was that Rosemary was dead,

05:16.984 --> 05:19.086
with this huge gash on her head.

05:20.253 --> 05:22.390
Mrs. Husband,
at the original trial,

05:22.423 --> 05:23.657
you never mentioned anything

05:23.691 --> 05:26.193
about Madeline
following Rosemary,

05:26.226 --> 05:28.496
nor did you mention anything
about a lantern

05:28.529 --> 05:30.163
or about her being on drugs.

05:30.197 --> 05:31.365
Nobody asked me.

05:31.399 --> 05:33.066
Really?

05:33.100 --> 05:35.068
You didn't think
it was important to tell anyone

05:35.102 --> 05:36.704
that you saw Madeline
follow Rosemary

05:36.737 --> 05:38.539
in the moments before her death?

05:38.572 --> 05:41.509
I think this would be the first
thing you would tell someone,

05:41.542 --> 05:42.676
anyone,

05:42.710 --> 05:44.344
the entire world.

05:44.378 --> 05:45.846
I honestly

05:45.879 --> 05:47.256
- don't know why I didn't.
- Is it because

05:47.280 --> 05:48.582
none of it actually happened?

05:48.616 --> 05:49.683
Objection. Argumentative.

05:49.717 --> 05:50.718
Withdrawn.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.252
Mrs. Husband,

05:52.285 --> 05:53.587
haven't you been cautioned

05:53.621 --> 05:56.390
against committing perjury
on the stand in the past?

05:56.424 --> 05:57.725
Objection. Relevance.

05:57.758 --> 05:58.726
Sustained.

05:58.759 --> 05:59.893
Prior bad acts, Your Honor.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.061
Goes to credibility.

06:01.094 --> 06:02.396
I'm establishing a pattern.

06:02.430 --> 06:04.865
And I'm not allowing it,
Mr. Boudreau.

06:04.898 --> 06:06.199
Let's stay on point.

06:07.601 --> 06:12.239
You said you saw Madeline
follow Rosemary with the lamp.

06:12.272 --> 06:14.908
- Did you follow them, too?
- No.

06:14.942 --> 06:16.920
Then you have no idea
whether Madeline and Rosemary

06:16.944 --> 06:18.579
ended up in the same spot.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.280
I know what I know.

06:20.313 --> 06:22.450
Madeline Scott killed Rosemary.

06:22.483 --> 06:24.251
And that's just another lie,
isn't it?

06:24.284 --> 06:25.294
Objection, Your Honor.
Defense is badgering

06:25.318 --> 06:26.286
- the witness.
- I'm just calling her

06:26.319 --> 06:28.255
what she is, Your Honor, a liar.

06:28.288 --> 06:30.390
Your Honor. You're on
thin ice, Mr. Boudreau.

06:30.424 --> 06:32.426
One more of those,
and I'll hold you in contempt.

06:33.461 --> 06:34.928
Apologies, Your Honor.

06:38.799 --> 06:40.300
Hey,
Linda Barrett working today?

06:40.333 --> 06:41.769
No, she quit.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.103
She quit? Really?

06:43.136 --> 06:44.304
When?

06:45.806 --> 06:47.107
Look, buddy,

06:47.140 --> 06:48.742
she's the key witness
in a murder trial,

06:48.776 --> 06:49.910
and I'm on the defense team.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.244
She's not answering our calls.

06:51.278 --> 06:52.580
This is life and death.

06:52.613 --> 06:54.482
All I know is yesterday
she got a package.

06:54.515 --> 06:55.625
Next thing I know, she quits.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.150
You have any idea
what was in it?

06:57.184 --> 06:58.285
No.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.588
Can I get a look

07:00.621 --> 07:03.323
at your surveillance footage?

07:03.356 --> 07:05.635
Linda Barrett vanished, but
I-I think I know what happened.

07:05.659 --> 07:09.296
The package she received
was delivered by PrivatePack.

07:09.329 --> 07:12.132
It's an encrypted online service
that anonymously sends

07:12.165 --> 07:14.635
whatever you want to whomever
you want whenever you want.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.470
So someone sent Linda a package,

07:16.504 --> 07:19.272
and whatever was inside,
it made her freak out.

07:19.306 --> 07:22.142
- Looks like witness tampering to me.
- Yeah, but what

07:22.175 --> 07:23.419
I don't understand is that...
what is it?

07:23.443 --> 07:26.480
I mean, what could be so bad it
would keep her from testifying?

07:26.514 --> 07:28.582
Sarah Tawney just called.

07:28.616 --> 07:30.317
She's backing out, too.

07:40.327 --> 07:42.195
Sarah, we know
why you've been avoiding us.

07:42.229 --> 07:44.798
Listen, you got a package,
didn't you?

07:44.832 --> 07:47.334
- What was in it?
- Did it have something to do with the cult?

07:50.337 --> 07:51.705
You know, when Jim Jones

07:51.739 --> 07:54.474
started his Peoples Temple cult
in Guyana,

07:54.508 --> 07:56.148
he had all his followers
write confessions

07:56.176 --> 07:57.545
to crimes they didn't commit

07:57.578 --> 07:59.880
so that he could always have
control over his flock

07:59.913 --> 08:01.281
so they would never betray him.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.950
Did something like that happen?

08:02.983 --> 08:04.685
It wasn't a letter.

08:04.718 --> 08:06.386
It was a videotape.

08:06.419 --> 08:08.388
It was a sex tape,

08:08.421 --> 08:09.623
- wasn't it?
- And other things

08:09.657 --> 08:10.624
I'd rather not discuss.

08:10.658 --> 08:11.825
With Ravi?

08:11.859 --> 08:13.393
Sarah, please.

08:13.426 --> 08:14.728
He wasn't on the tape.

08:14.762 --> 08:17.598
It's just me
and some of the other girls.

08:18.699 --> 08:20.367
Ravi took videos of all of us.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.135
I guess I was stupid
to think that,

08:22.169 --> 08:23.737
when he died,
the past died with him.

08:23.771 --> 08:25.005
Sarah, if you don't testify,

08:25.038 --> 08:27.641
I'm gonna go to prison
for the rest of my life.

08:27.675 --> 08:29.418
Sarah, we can subpoena you
and force you to testify.

08:29.442 --> 08:33.280
If I testify, whoever sent this
promised to post it online.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.683
Please, I can't do this.

08:36.717 --> 08:39.919
Okay.

08:39.953 --> 08:42.923
Who else do you think
could have sent the tapes?

08:42.956 --> 08:44.592
I have no idea.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.359
What about Heather Dupinski?

08:46.393 --> 08:48.204
You said that she was number two
with the cult.

08:48.228 --> 08:50.339
Do you think, before he died,
Ravi could have sent her

08:50.363 --> 08:52.766
- the tapes?
- It's possible.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.104
If Heather sent those tapes...

08:57.137 --> 09:00.040
It means she killed Rosemary.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.842
You're claiming
witness tampering?

09:01.875 --> 09:04.578
Defense's request
for a mistrial is ridiculous.

09:04.612 --> 09:06.680
We believe prosecution witness
Heather Husband sent

09:06.714 --> 09:08.248
- those videotapes.
- Mrs. Husband?

09:08.281 --> 09:10.584
I never sent any videotapes
to anyone.

09:10.618 --> 09:11.785
They're lying.

09:11.819 --> 09:14.554
They are grasping at nothing,
Your Honor.

09:14.588 --> 09:16.566
They attack the witness on the
stand, and then they throw these

09:16.590 --> 09:18.626
unsubstantiated
and absurd accusations.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.469
Your Honor, we have a legitimate
interest in discovering

09:20.493 --> 09:23.296
who tampered with our witnesses
and why.

09:23.330 --> 09:24.798
What's the content of the tapes?

09:24.832 --> 09:28.401
Embarrassing activities
at the cult, Your Honor.

09:28.435 --> 09:30.470
Humiliating acts caught on tape,

09:30.503 --> 09:32.806
used to intimidate
and control the members.

09:32.840 --> 09:36.644
We posit that Ravi used
the tapes against these girls

09:36.677 --> 09:40.247
to repeatedly force them
into sexual situations.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.650
Ms. Scott,
for me to declare a mistrial,

09:42.683 --> 09:45.418
I need proof that the tapes
actually exist.

09:45.452 --> 09:47.621
Our witnesses are afraid
to turn them over, Your Honor.

09:47.655 --> 09:49.790
Then all of this is speculation.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.725
Your motion for a mistrial
is denied.

09:51.759 --> 09:53.293
We reconvene tomorrow morning.

10:02.535 --> 10:04.404
You think we should get
something to eat

10:04.437 --> 10:05.749
- other than licorice?
- Nah, I'm good.

10:05.773 --> 10:07.440
Unless you got some ice cream.

10:07.474 --> 10:09.476
Do I have ice cream?

10:11.011 --> 10:12.646
You expecting somebody?

10:12.680 --> 10:13.847
No.

10:14.882 --> 10:16.016
Hello.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.785
I'm Joan Myers with CPS.

10:17.818 --> 10:20.187
I'm looking for Nikki
and Nathan Castro.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.189
Yeah, Nikki's at work.

10:22.222 --> 10:23.824
Na-Nathan's here.

10:23.857 --> 10:26.259
How did you know
where to find us?

10:26.293 --> 10:28.095
CPS has its ways.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.863
May I come in?

10:29.897 --> 10:32.800
Well, that actually depends
on what you want.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.803
Standard check on the child's
living conditions.

10:35.836 --> 10:39.472
I understand he's been spending
a good deal of time here.

10:39.506 --> 10:41.541
Are those swords on the wall?

10:42.575 --> 10:43.877
Maybe.

10:45.913 --> 10:48.381
I'm guessing that's a bad thing.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.383
Are you gonna let me in or not?

10:50.417 --> 10:51.418
Yeah.

10:52.686 --> 10:53.854
What did you say?

10:53.887 --> 10:55.655
I need to know
exactly what you said.

10:55.689 --> 10:57.691
Okay, I told her
that Nathan was doing great.

10:57.725 --> 10:59.526
And what did she say?

10:59.559 --> 11:00.870
She focused on my nunchucks
a lot, actually,

11:00.894 --> 11:02.562
- and-and my...
- Bodie!

11:02.595 --> 11:04.131
I just...
I-I can't lose him, Bodie.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.633
I can't lose my little boy.
I can't lose him.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.468
It's gonna be okay. All right?

11:08.501 --> 11:10.303
90% of the time,

11:10.337 --> 11:12.706
family court awards custody back
to the birth mother.

11:12.740 --> 11:16.276
And if Daniela can prove
that she's even a little...

11:17.577 --> 11:19.146
I know.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.314
You're not gonna lose him.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.216
You can't promise that.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.252
Okay? No one can.

11:26.754 --> 11:28.321
No one.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.257
I...

11:33.593 --> 11:35.038
Mr. Scott, I realize
this must be difficult for you,

11:35.062 --> 11:37.597
but thank you
for agreeing to testify today.

11:37.630 --> 11:39.599
On the night
of Rosemary Lynch's murder,

11:39.632 --> 11:41.769
were you
with your sister Madeline?

11:43.737 --> 11:45.739
Mr. Scott?

11:48.208 --> 11:49.877
- Your Honor.
- The witness is

11:49.910 --> 11:51.879
directed to answer the question.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.280
I don't remember.

11:53.313 --> 11:54.281
If I may,

11:54.314 --> 11:57.050
I'll refresh
the witness' recollection.

11:57.084 --> 11:59.787
Mr. Scott,
you have previously stated

11:59.820 --> 12:02.122
that you were
with your sister, Madeline,

12:02.155 --> 12:05.392
at Quarry Lake on the evening
of Rosemary Lynch's murder.

12:05.425 --> 12:08.261
- Correct?
- Like I said, I don't remember.

12:08.295 --> 12:10.597
Permission to treat
this witness as hostile.

12:10.630 --> 12:12.465
- Permission granted.
- Were you aware

12:12.499 --> 12:14.467
that your sister cannot account
for three hours

12:14.501 --> 12:16.103
of her time on that night?

12:17.570 --> 12:19.539
- I can't remember.
- Then I'll remind you.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.441
It was during those three hours

12:21.474 --> 12:23.811
that Ms. Scott conveniently
cannot recall the events

12:23.844 --> 12:26.146
of the evening when
Rosemary Lynch was murdered.

12:26.179 --> 12:28.882
Well, to quote our Lord
and Savior Jesus Christ,

12:28.916 --> 12:30.583
"Those are your words,
sir, not mine."

12:30.617 --> 12:32.328
Mr. Scott, on the evening
of Rosemary's disappearance,

12:32.352 --> 12:35.322
before her body was found,
did you see the defendant,

12:35.355 --> 12:37.657
Madeline Scott,
near Cathedral Cove

12:37.690 --> 12:40.460
where the murder weapon
was found, high on drugs?

12:42.362 --> 12:44.297
I'm warning you.
Either you answer the questions

12:44.331 --> 12:46.834
or you'll be cited for contempt
and jailed until you answer.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.936
Jailed.

12:48.969 --> 12:51.271
Jailed.

12:51.304 --> 12:53.640
Your Honor, you can do
whatever you want with me,

12:53.673 --> 12:55.342
but I refuse to answer questions

12:55.375 --> 12:58.178
from this corrupt prosecutor!

12:58.211 --> 12:59.655
Mr. Scott, I find you
to be in contempt

12:59.679 --> 13:01.014
of these proceedings.

13:01.048 --> 13:02.249
Take the witness into custody.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.551
Been there before,
haven't I, Gore?

13:14.694 --> 13:16.696
Well,

13:16.729 --> 13:18.131
that was one of the sweetest,

13:18.165 --> 13:20.300
stupidest things
anyone's ever done for me.

13:21.334 --> 13:23.536
I'm your big brother.
What'd you expect?

13:24.571 --> 13:26.206
Where were you?

13:26.239 --> 13:28.475
You disappeared. I was worried.

13:28.508 --> 13:31.678
Why didn't you talk to me before
you pulled a stunt like that?

13:31.711 --> 13:33.713
Because you were gonna try
to talk me out of it.

13:33.746 --> 13:35.348
You're damn right.

13:35.382 --> 13:36.984
I would have succeeded, too.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.718
Come on. You really think

13:38.751 --> 13:40.720
I was gonna testify
against you, Maddie?

13:40.753 --> 13:43.556
What did he want you
to testify to?

13:43.590 --> 13:46.426
He said I was on drugs.
What was he talking about?

13:49.062 --> 13:53.133
Those three hours that you
couldn't account for that night,

13:53.166 --> 13:55.035
you weren't just asleep, Maddie.

13:55.068 --> 13:57.770
You were-you were acting weird,
like you were on drugs.

14:01.208 --> 14:02.910
No.

14:04.444 --> 14:05.913
No, I didn't take anything.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.580
I never did. I don't do drugs.

14:07.614 --> 14:09.182
I know.

14:09.216 --> 14:10.717
But something was up.

14:10.750 --> 14:12.085
You were out of it.

14:12.119 --> 14:13.921
I mean, you didn't...
you didn't even

14:13.954 --> 14:16.223
go looking for Rosemary
until the next morning.

14:16.256 --> 14:18.358
- When we found her?
- Yes.

14:18.391 --> 14:20.493
I don't know
if you got slipped something,

14:20.527 --> 14:22.429
if you-you took something
that you didn't know,

14:22.462 --> 14:23.863
but something was off.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.567
If I was high on drugs
and I don't remember

14:27.600 --> 14:28.878
what happened,
I could have done anything.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.403
No, you didn't do it. Stop.

14:30.437 --> 14:33.073
- It was my lantern.
- No. Listen to me.

14:33.106 --> 14:34.274
You're innocent.

14:47.287 --> 14:49.322
How are you doing?

14:51.491 --> 14:53.493
I don't know.

14:58.999 --> 15:01.234
I'm feeling a little lost.

15:01.268 --> 15:04.137
Yeah, well,
Bellows presented a good case.

15:04.171 --> 15:07.474
But... now it's our turn.

15:07.507 --> 15:10.743
And we will fight back
with everything we've got.

15:10.777 --> 15:11.979
What have we got?

15:13.146 --> 15:16.249
Neither Sarah nor Linda
will testify.

15:16.283 --> 15:18.718
We crapped out
on our witness tampering motion.

15:18.751 --> 15:21.388
You did a noble job
cross-examining Heather,

15:21.421 --> 15:22.922
but it wasn't a slam dunk.

15:24.357 --> 15:25.892
Levi pleaded the fifth,

15:25.925 --> 15:28.628
so the jury's just gonna think
that he's hiding something.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.898
Bellows is kicking our ass.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.867
No, it hasn't gone
as easy as I thought it would.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.771
But I am still not daunted.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.909
Because you are innocent,
Madeline Scott.

15:42.942 --> 15:46.646
And that makes
everything I do make sense.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.283
I won't lose you.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.953
You're really good at this,
counselor.

15:55.622 --> 15:59.259
So, our newest
alternate suspect...

15:59.292 --> 16:00.927
Heather Husband.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.030
I don't know.

16:03.063 --> 16:04.497
You know,
I know Heather's involved,

16:04.531 --> 16:06.533
but I don't buy her
as the killer.

16:06.566 --> 16:08.935
Well, why not?
All roads lead to her.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.338
No. I saw her
in the courtroom earlier.

16:12.372 --> 16:13.540
She was really affected

16:13.573 --> 16:15.442
by what I was saying happened
to those girls.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.710
Maybe it was guilt
for what she did to them.

16:20.147 --> 16:22.182
Or maybe she was a victim, too.

16:23.216 --> 16:24.651
I know. If not Heather,

16:24.684 --> 16:26.686
then whoever Heather
was lying for on the stand

16:26.719 --> 16:28.321
is the one who sent those tapes.

16:31.158 --> 16:32.959
She's protecting him.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.062
Heather's protecting Ravi.

16:35.095 --> 16:37.330
Why would she protect
a dead man?

16:38.365 --> 16:39.766
He's still alive.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.871
With the election
only five days away,

16:44.904 --> 16:48.575
Gore Bellows is pulling ahead
in the attorney general's race.

16:48.608 --> 16:51.744
Pundits agree that his
candidacy could live or die

16:51.778 --> 16:54.647
based on the verdict in the
Madeline Scott murder trial.

16:54.681 --> 16:57.384
Now, some have argued
he should stall the verdict

16:57.417 --> 16:59.586
just in case he loses.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.900
Hi.

17:15.301 --> 17:18.204
I really need to talk to you.

17:19.239 --> 17:20.373
About what?

17:22.974 --> 17:24.977
I got one of those tapes, too.

17:46.233 --> 17:48.501
Linda and Sarah
told you the truth.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.871
There was a cult.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.141
I got sucked into it
by this guy.

17:54.174 --> 17:57.877
He was so charismatic and wise.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.947
Just felt like
he could see into your soul.

18:00.980 --> 18:02.682
You're talking about Ravi.

18:04.151 --> 18:06.586
He treated us all like adults.

18:06.619 --> 18:09.021
He made us feel so special.

18:13.025 --> 18:14.827
We did anything he wanted.

18:14.861 --> 18:17.029
We wanted his approval.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.669
Yeah, I...

18:22.702 --> 18:25.672
saw all the initials
with the hash marks

18:25.705 --> 18:29.008
carved into the cabinet
at Sparrow Ridge.

18:30.210 --> 18:31.944
I assumed that was all the times

18:31.978 --> 18:33.680
everyone had had sex with him.

18:33.713 --> 18:34.747
Yeah.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.784
But what you don't know
is the night Rosemary died

18:37.817 --> 18:39.352
he wanted you.

18:40.887 --> 18:42.855
Hey. Where's Madeline?

18:42.889 --> 18:45.358
- Ravi's gonna be here soon.
- No. She's not feeling well.

18:45.392 --> 18:47.694
Just get her.
Ravi doesn't like to wait.

18:47.727 --> 18:48.695
I'll do it myself.

18:48.728 --> 18:50.163
It's not happening, Heather.

18:50.197 --> 18:52.965
Rosemary was protecting me
from him.

18:55.535 --> 18:58.671
I'm so sorry
for what happened to you.

18:59.739 --> 19:01.308
I appreciate you saying that.

19:01.341 --> 19:03.176
I do.

19:03.210 --> 19:06.313
But I'm not sure
I can forgive you.

19:11.251 --> 19:12.852
But I am...

19:14.086 --> 19:16.489
sorry for what happened to you.

19:21.027 --> 19:24.096
I didn't realize
all the damage he caused.

19:27.099 --> 19:29.702
I didn't realize
he was hurting me.

19:29.736 --> 19:31.904
Did you see Ravi kill Rosemary?

19:31.938 --> 19:35.942
No. I honestly didn't think
that Ravi showed up that night.

19:38.110 --> 19:40.079
This whole time,

19:40.112 --> 19:42.715
I thought
that you killed Rosemary.

19:42.749 --> 19:44.417
Until you got the tape?

19:44.451 --> 19:46.886
Yeah. I always thought
Ravi was dead.

19:46.919 --> 19:50.056
Toby said he died
in an ashram in Bangladesh.

19:50.089 --> 19:52.058
I was gonna drop out of school
and go find him,

19:52.091 --> 19:54.060
but Toby showed me this article.

19:54.093 --> 19:57.264
Ravi died in a fire
with 14 other people.

19:57.297 --> 20:00.099
It was a few months
after Rosemary was killed.

20:00.132 --> 20:02.769
Wait, Toby Kissell
told you that?

20:02.802 --> 20:04.904
Yeah.

20:04.937 --> 20:07.740
He used to do a lot
of Ravi's dirty work.

20:07.774 --> 20:10.209
They were super close.

20:10.243 --> 20:13.246
He did everything
Ravi asked him to.

20:19.619 --> 20:22.389
Toby committed suicide
because of the guilt.

20:27.827 --> 20:30.630
He knew Ravi killed Rosemary.

20:32.999 --> 20:35.167
I wasn't lying to you, Maddie.

20:36.469 --> 20:38.638
She was my best friend, too.

20:39.839 --> 20:41.841
I hated you for killing her.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.916
I believe you, Heather.

20:50.950 --> 20:53.586
I still miss her.

20:58.024 --> 21:00.026
She was great, right?

21:02.529 --> 21:05.064
I want to testify for you.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.800
I'll tell the court
everything I know.

21:09.536 --> 21:11.304
It won't work.

21:11.338 --> 21:13.806
When a prosecution witness
flips,

21:13.840 --> 21:16.008
they're just deemed unreliable.

21:16.042 --> 21:17.677
It'll backfire.

21:17.710 --> 21:19.712
What are you gonna do?

21:23.950 --> 21:26.052
Ravi's still alive.

21:27.520 --> 21:29.522
I'm gonna find him.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.632
Do I have to go?

21:43.403 --> 21:45.372
Nathan,

21:45.405 --> 21:47.206
we talked about this.

21:47.239 --> 21:51.077
Judge says you got to go stay
with your mom now. Okay?

21:52.412 --> 21:54.381
Hey, tie your shoe.

21:54.414 --> 21:56.516
She's gonna be here any second.

21:57.917 --> 22:01.187
So, I'm not gonna
see you anymore?

22:02.422 --> 22:04.691
Hey, um...

22:04.724 --> 22:08.227
look, we're gonna see you
all the time, all right?

22:08.260 --> 22:10.397
We'll go to the park
and have ninja fights

22:10.430 --> 22:12.164
and take trips to the arcade.

22:12.198 --> 22:14.200
You promise?

22:17.437 --> 22:19.439
Yeah.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.241
Double promise, bro.

22:23.610 --> 22:24.853
Your backpack's
in the other room.

22:24.877 --> 22:26.546
Get it.

22:30.249 --> 22:32.552
I can't let him see me cry.

22:32.585 --> 22:34.153
I know. I hear you.

22:34.186 --> 22:35.555
It's gonna be okay.

22:35.588 --> 22:38.190
Look, hey, we're gonna keep
eagle eyes on her.

22:38.224 --> 22:40.569
The second she screws up, we're
gonna take her back to court.

22:40.593 --> 22:42.194
All right?

22:42.228 --> 22:44.764
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

22:45.965 --> 22:48.267
I love you.

22:48.300 --> 22:50.703
I love you so much.

22:50.737 --> 22:52.572
I love you, too, babe.

23:04.116 --> 23:05.785
- You got anything?
- Yeah.

23:07.654 --> 23:09.722
So, I found this.

23:09.756 --> 23:12.459
It's a death certificate
from Bangladesh.

23:12.492 --> 23:16.963
Says Robert Carter died
February 13, 2004 in Dhaka.

23:16.996 --> 23:18.765
So you think the death
certificate is fake?

23:18.798 --> 23:20.767
I do. There's no record
of the remains

23:20.800 --> 23:23.936
of Robert Carter being recovered
or returned to the U.S.

23:23.970 --> 23:25.805
So he claims he died
in a real fire,

23:25.838 --> 23:26.806
faked a death certificate...

23:26.839 --> 23:28.775
And then quietly returns
as someone else.

23:28.808 --> 23:30.577
But as who?

23:32.078 --> 23:34.847
The only person who knows that
killed himself a few months ago.

23:35.915 --> 23:38.718
Maybe Toby Kissell has relatives
we can talk to.

23:38.751 --> 23:41.454
You know what, he does.
He has a sister, Zoe.

23:42.522 --> 23:43.656
All right.

23:43.690 --> 23:47.426
Zoe, thanks again
for having us over.

23:47.460 --> 23:48.828
Of course.

23:48.861 --> 23:50.296
I'm happy to help.

23:51.931 --> 23:55.568
Um... well, these are
my brother's things.

23:55.602 --> 23:57.336
He... he didn't have much.

23:57.369 --> 23:59.271
Right here?

23:59.305 --> 24:01.808
All right. We're just gonna
take a quick look.

24:03.643 --> 24:06.345
I don't know why
he killed himself.

24:06.378 --> 24:09.949
I mean, he'd been down,
but everything seemed fine.

24:09.982 --> 24:14.286
Well, Zoe, whatever it was,
it possibly ties into our case.

24:14.320 --> 24:17.289
So... hopefully,
we can find out.

24:17.323 --> 24:19.726
Thank you.

24:24.497 --> 24:26.966
Whoa.

24:26.999 --> 24:28.367
What?

24:28.400 --> 24:30.369
Toby's bank statements.

24:30.402 --> 24:32.038
This guy was broke.

24:32.071 --> 24:33.740
Isn't everyone like that?

24:34.807 --> 24:37.409
It's stuck.

24:39.512 --> 24:41.648
What is this?

24:41.681 --> 24:44.116
- What'd you find?
- I found Handycam tapes.

24:44.150 --> 24:46.986
And these date back to the pre-
smartphone Cretaceous period.

24:47.019 --> 24:48.988
And here is your Handycam.

24:49.021 --> 24:51.223
Well, it's not mine,
but I do have one just like it.

24:51.257 --> 24:53.893
- What if these are more teen sex videos?
- Easy, perv.

24:53.926 --> 24:56.395
I'm serious. If they are,

24:56.428 --> 24:58.765
that's definitely evidence
of the cult.

25:03.836 --> 25:06.038
- Hey, Bodie?
- Yeah?

25:06.072 --> 25:09.008
Look at this. Look.

25:12.078 --> 25:14.046
My God.

25:15.214 --> 25:16.549
Is that...?

25:17.584 --> 25:18.918
Yeah.

25:21.588 --> 25:23.856
Mr. Boudreau,
is the defense ready?

25:25.224 --> 25:27.159
Yes, we are, Your Honor.

25:27.193 --> 25:29.395
The defense calls
Rosemary Lynch.

25:31.530 --> 25:32.865
Order.

25:32.899 --> 25:34.901
Order!

25:39.438 --> 25:42.842
Get that out of my face.
Toby, turn that off.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.911
Why? I thought we'd make
a hot little tape.

25:44.944 --> 25:46.545
Turn it off or get out.

25:46.579 --> 25:48.080
Okay. Fine.

25:48.114 --> 25:50.116
Turning it off.

25:54.253 --> 25:56.255
Did you... did you bring
the downers?

25:56.288 --> 25:57.757
What do you need roofies for?

25:57.790 --> 26:00.593
Is sex with me that bad
you want to sleep through it?

26:00.627 --> 26:03.429
No, it's not... for me, stupid.

26:03.462 --> 26:05.097
You can't ever
repeat this, okay?

26:05.131 --> 26:06.599
Like, ever.

26:07.600 --> 26:09.401
It's for Madeline.

26:09.435 --> 26:12.905
You want to give them to
Madeline so she can join us?

26:12.939 --> 26:15.374
No need. You know she wants me.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.443
No.

26:17.476 --> 26:19.278
I'm gonna knock her out

26:19.311 --> 26:21.280
so that Ravi can't touch her.

26:21.313 --> 26:22.882
Man.

26:22.915 --> 26:24.751
He's gonna be so pissed.

26:39.331 --> 26:41.300
That night,

26:41.333 --> 26:44.303
Rosemary Lynch intended
to drug Madeline

26:44.336 --> 26:46.906
to protect her
from sleeping with Ravi,

26:46.939 --> 26:49.809
her real killer.

26:49.842 --> 26:52.812
Rosemary died
protecting Madeline.

26:52.845 --> 26:56.482
She was trying to save
her best friend.

27:07.493 --> 27:10.129
Certainly heard some
wild stories during this trial.

27:11.864 --> 27:15.167
But we must not forget
the basic truth

27:15.201 --> 27:19.672
Madeline Scott was in possession
of the murder weapon.

27:19.706 --> 27:23.609
The defense has played you
a videotape

27:23.642 --> 27:25.812
to prove Madeline's innocence.

27:28.047 --> 27:30.049
But what it showed
was her motive.

27:30.082 --> 27:32.618
Rosemary Lynch slept with a boy

27:32.651 --> 27:35.554
that Madeline loved,
and then fed her drugs.

27:35.587 --> 27:39.325
So, in an agitated
and drug-induced state,

27:39.358 --> 27:41.694
Madeline Scott sought revenge

27:41.728 --> 27:44.563
by killing Rosemary Lynch.

27:44.596 --> 27:47.633
Don't let the craziness the
defense has thrown in your path

27:47.666 --> 27:51.003
cloud the basic truth.

27:53.205 --> 27:55.708
Madeline Scott
killed her best friend.

27:57.376 --> 27:59.812
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

27:59.846 --> 28:03.750
it is time for justice
to finally be done.

28:12.058 --> 28:14.360
Your Honor,
I ask leave of the court

28:14.393 --> 28:16.162
for a substitution of counsel.

28:16.195 --> 28:19.866
In place of Mr. Boudreau,
I will represent myself pro se.

28:19.899 --> 28:21.633
Permission granted.

28:31.477 --> 28:34.413
I thought I understood
friendship.

28:35.748 --> 28:39.752
I thought I understood
sacrifice.

28:39.786 --> 28:42.388
Heroism.

28:42.421 --> 28:44.623
But it wasn't until Rosemary

28:44.656 --> 28:48.928
that I saw what these words
really meant.

28:50.062 --> 28:52.064
The evidence shows

28:52.098 --> 28:54.700
that I did not kill Rosemary.

28:54.733 --> 28:57.636
The video you watched
shows clearly that, in fact,

28:57.669 --> 29:01.207
Rosemary died to protect me

29:01.240 --> 29:04.844
from a sadistic serial rapist.

29:05.945 --> 29:07.746
Rosemary cared more
about other people

29:07.780 --> 29:09.748
than she cared about herself.

29:09.782 --> 29:12.151
And this monster,

29:12.184 --> 29:14.553
who calls himself Ravi,

29:14.586 --> 29:18.757
rewarded that selflessness
by crushing her skull.

29:20.126 --> 29:23.095
He crushed the love

29:23.129 --> 29:24.797
and the life

29:24.831 --> 29:27.800
out of my best friend.

29:34.974 --> 29:38.277
There are two tragedies
in this case

29:38.310 --> 29:40.279
Rosemary's death...

29:42.548 --> 29:45.417
and the destruction

29:45.451 --> 29:49.621
that her first murder trial
brought on me,

29:49.655 --> 29:52.791
my brother and my family.

29:52.825 --> 29:54.693
Because when someone
is wrongfully convicted,

29:54.726 --> 29:56.695
there's more than
just one victim.

29:56.728 --> 29:59.431
There's countless.

29:59.465 --> 30:01.000
But you...

30:02.634 --> 30:06.138
you can end these tragedies.

30:06.172 --> 30:08.640
You can end the cycle
here, today.

30:10.476 --> 30:13.846
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury...

30:13.880 --> 30:15.882
I'm innocent.

30:19.251 --> 30:21.687
I am innocent.

30:44.510 --> 30:47.246
Yeah, I'm not gonna lie, Gore,

30:47.279 --> 30:49.415
you got balls of steel.

30:49.448 --> 30:51.317
How do you mean?

30:51.350 --> 30:53.552
Well, you could have stalled
this case for months,

30:53.585 --> 30:56.522
but you finished just days
before the election.

30:56.555 --> 30:58.324
Of course, if you lose...

30:58.357 --> 31:00.526
I didn't have any choice.

31:00.559 --> 31:03.162
Ever since Madeline
was released,

31:03.195 --> 31:04.763
every time I look in the mirror,

31:04.796 --> 31:07.033
the case is there.

31:07.066 --> 31:08.800
It never goes away.

31:10.402 --> 31:12.905
I just need it
to finally go away.

31:15.541 --> 31:18.710
Well... I hope you win.

31:18.744 --> 31:21.180
You know, for your own spiritual
well-being, of course,

31:21.213 --> 31:23.515
but... you know, even more
for all the freaking money

31:23.549 --> 31:25.051
I have put into this campaign.

31:25.084 --> 31:27.519
As I recall, you pushed me
into going after her as well.

31:27.553 --> 31:28.887
You're right. I did. I did.

31:28.921 --> 31:31.057
I thought she was guilty
as hell. I still do.

31:33.425 --> 31:34.526
Madeline?

31:34.560 --> 31:37.563
Ms. Scott, Rick Zahn.

31:37.596 --> 31:39.898
Mr. Zahn is an informal advisor
of mine.

31:39.932 --> 31:41.033
It's a pleasure.

31:41.067 --> 31:42.868
I was...
I was sitting in the back,

31:42.901 --> 31:44.403
but I saw your closing argument.

31:44.436 --> 31:45.704
It was very powerful.

31:45.737 --> 31:46.905
Thank you.

31:46.939 --> 31:48.107
Do you have a minute?

31:53.445 --> 31:55.747
So, jury's been out three days.

31:55.781 --> 31:57.583
I'm sure they'll do
the right thing.

31:57.616 --> 31:59.551
Yeah. I feel the same.

31:59.585 --> 32:01.087
I came here
to tell you something,

32:01.120 --> 32:02.754
but I have a question first.

32:02.788 --> 32:05.091
I'd really appreciate it
if you would be honest with me.

32:05.124 --> 32:06.458
I always am.

32:06.492 --> 32:08.260
If you weren't running
for attorney general,

32:08.294 --> 32:10.296
would you
have prosecuted me again?

32:11.964 --> 32:14.266
Yes.

32:16.368 --> 32:18.113
You said you had something
you wanted to tell me?

32:18.137 --> 32:21.940
Yeah.

32:21.974 --> 32:23.809
I forgive you.

32:24.843 --> 32:25.911
Okay.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.946
No, really. All these years,
I took it personally,

32:27.980 --> 32:29.948
but this is just who you are.

32:29.982 --> 32:31.662
I don't think anything's
gonna change that.

32:33.352 --> 32:35.321
You may have
had a soul once, but...

32:36.688 --> 32:39.025
I think it's as dead
as Rosemary Lynch.

32:42.628 --> 32:44.663
Manslaughter.

32:44.696 --> 32:46.932
15 years.

32:46.965 --> 32:49.435
Give you credit for time served,
you're out in five.

32:49.468 --> 32:50.945
You didn't hear a word I said,
did you?

32:50.969 --> 32:53.272
Take the deal, Madeline.

32:53.305 --> 32:55.741
It may surprise you
to hear this I like you.

32:56.875 --> 32:58.444
I think you're a good person

32:58.477 --> 33:00.812
who had a very bad night.

33:00.846 --> 33:02.848
I didn't kill her.

33:02.881 --> 33:04.850
No matter what the jury says,

33:04.883 --> 33:06.685
no matter what
the public thinks,

33:06.718 --> 33:08.987
I didn't kill Rosemary.

33:09.021 --> 33:11.023
And you and I will both
go to our graves

33:11.057 --> 33:12.558
knowing that's true.

33:30.276 --> 33:32.611
Will the defendant please rise?

33:42.688 --> 33:45.157
Madam Foreperson, what say you?

33:45.191 --> 33:47.426
In the matter
of The State of Illinois

33:47.459 --> 33:49.595
v. Madeline Elizabeth Scott

33:49.628 --> 33:53.232
as to the sole count
of murder in the first degree,

33:53.265 --> 33:54.433
we find the defendant...

33:55.901 --> 33:57.203
not guilty.

34:13.418 --> 34:15.954
Thank you.

34:19.658 --> 34:21.793
My girl.

34:23.995 --> 34:25.931
Get over here.!

34:27.266 --> 34:29.235
You do like me.

34:40.446 --> 34:43.114
Hey. We finally got the felony
arrest record for Robert Carter.

34:43.149 --> 34:44.626
- That took long enough.
- Yeah, exactly.

34:44.650 --> 34:46.784
The Saint Charles, Missouri, PD
should really learn

34:46.818 --> 34:48.654
how to digitize their files.

34:48.687 --> 34:50.688
But, anyways, this'll
tell us who Ravi is.

34:55.261 --> 34:57.263
What are we waiting for here?

34:59.265 --> 35:02.168
Yeah. Sorry. Just, um...

35:02.201 --> 35:05.837
about to see the face of the man
who killed my best friend, so...

35:07.839 --> 35:09.107
Yeah.

35:14.813 --> 35:16.482
So?

35:17.516 --> 35:18.784
My God.

35:22.120 --> 35:23.455
So, I hate to give you

35:23.489 --> 35:25.624
bad news on the eve
of your election.

35:25.657 --> 35:27.959
Which I'm now going to lose,
by the way.

35:27.993 --> 35:30.962
But I found Ravi,
the cult leader.

35:32.531 --> 35:35.534
He was still alive.
Just changed his name.

35:38.204 --> 35:40.306
It's Rick Zahn.

35:40.339 --> 35:42.308
Your chief campaign donor.

35:42.341 --> 35:45.110
Robert Carter, aka Ravi.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.983
Heather Husband,
Sarah Tawney, Linda Barrett...

35:47.012 --> 35:49.014
They've all confirmed
that it's him.

35:49.047 --> 35:50.982
He targeted you, right?

35:51.016 --> 35:52.951
Influenced you
to prosecute me again,

35:52.984 --> 35:54.920
cover his tracks.

36:03.262 --> 36:05.197
You knew?

36:05.231 --> 36:07.566
Early this morning.

36:07.599 --> 36:10.035
I had Homicide run a few checks.

36:13.071 --> 36:15.407
Madeline, I'm so sorry.

36:26.017 --> 36:27.886
Don't be.

36:27.919 --> 36:30.021
I already forgave you.

36:30.055 --> 36:31.433
I don't know what
you were planning,

36:31.457 --> 36:33.392
but I already gave it
to a few reporters.

36:33.425 --> 36:35.002
It's gonna break
first thing tomorrow morning.

36:35.026 --> 36:37.563
I don't know what kind of damage
that's gonna do

36:37.596 --> 36:40.732
to your campaign, but that
shouldn't matter, right?

36:40.766 --> 36:42.734
You beat me in court.

36:44.303 --> 36:47.406
And you put the final nail
in the coffin of my campaign.

36:47.439 --> 36:50.242
I'd like to say
I'm not enjoying this, but...

36:50.276 --> 36:52.378
what I really care about

36:52.411 --> 36:55.914
is that Rosemary finally gets
the justice she deserves.

36:55.947 --> 36:57.716
Of course.

36:57.749 --> 37:01.052
And I assure you...

37:01.086 --> 37:04.222
justice will be served.

37:15.401 --> 37:17.002
All rise.

37:18.570 --> 37:20.138
The State v. Madeline

37:20.171 --> 37:22.107
and Levi Scott will now proceed.

37:22.140 --> 37:25.377
We, the jury, find
the defendants, Madeline Scott

37:25.411 --> 37:27.245
and Levi Scott,
guilty of the crime

37:27.279 --> 37:29.457
- of the murder of Rosemary Lynch.
- No, we're innocent!

37:29.481 --> 37:30.792
- We're innocent!
- Your Honor, please! No!

37:30.816 --> 37:32.126
- I would never hurt Rosemary!
- No! Your Honor!

37:32.150 --> 37:33.619
Your Honor, please! No!

37:33.652 --> 37:35.654
We're innocent!

37:38.490 --> 37:41.760
This is a little
dramatic, isn't it, Gore?

37:41.793 --> 37:44.796
I mean, even for you.

37:47.132 --> 37:49.968
You came to see me just after
Toby Kissell killed himself.

37:51.503 --> 37:53.505
You were afraid
your cover was gonna be blown,

37:53.539 --> 37:54.840
so you used your money

37:54.873 --> 37:57.108
to push me into retrying
Madeline Scott.

37:58.710 --> 38:01.146
What the hell
are you talking about?

38:01.179 --> 38:03.449
Don't waste your time
denying it.

38:03.482 --> 38:06.184
Your teenage victims
already identified you.

38:07.386 --> 38:09.821
They thought you were dead.

38:09.855 --> 38:12.324
I was.

38:14.860 --> 38:16.962
How many youngsters,

38:16.995 --> 38:19.465
underaged girls, were there?

38:19.498 --> 38:22.801
Ten? 15? 20?

38:24.903 --> 38:26.505
It's not my fault.

38:27.906 --> 38:31.343
God made me this way.

38:31.377 --> 38:34.212
But then he led me
onto the path to salvation.

38:34.245 --> 38:37.516
I started thinking
about ways I could use

38:37.549 --> 38:40.652
these drugs that I had made.

38:40.686 --> 38:43.054
Next thing I knew, I had created
a pharmaceutical company

38:43.088 --> 38:46.725
that has saved
hundreds of thousands of lives.

38:46.758 --> 38:48.460
So, one poor little girl
had to die

38:48.494 --> 38:50.562
so that so many could be cured.

38:52.364 --> 38:54.766
Out of my darkness
I have brought light.

38:55.767 --> 38:57.736
You're still a murderer.

38:57.769 --> 38:59.381
- A murderer that you're in bed with.
- You think that's

38:59.405 --> 39:01.206
gonna stop me coming after you?

39:05.777 --> 39:08.514
I will take you down
with me, Gore.

39:09.681 --> 39:11.850
I'll testify
that you knew the entire time

39:11.883 --> 39:14.853
who I was, and you took
my seven million dollars

39:14.886 --> 39:17.355
in exchange for
prosecuting Madeline Scott.

39:19.591 --> 39:21.927
Why did you do it?

39:21.960 --> 39:24.630
Why did you kill that girl?

39:30.969 --> 39:32.237
Rosemary!

39:32.270 --> 39:34.239
I am not playing games here.

39:34.272 --> 39:36.107
- Go get Madeline.
- No.

39:36.141 --> 39:38.209
- She doesn't belong with us.
- I decide that!

39:38.243 --> 39:39.778
If you go anywhere near her,

39:39.811 --> 39:42.113
I'll tell everyone what we do
in that farmhouse.

39:42.147 --> 39:44.115
- You'll go to jail.
- You little whore!

39:54.159 --> 39:56.628
Don't worry about it.

39:56.662 --> 39:59.064
Hey.

39:59.097 --> 40:01.967
We can fix this.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.969
We can.

40:04.002 --> 40:06.371
I'll disappear.

40:06.404 --> 40:08.239
Tonight.

40:08.273 --> 40:11.276
You'll never have to worry
about me again.

40:14.279 --> 40:16.948
Take a look down there.

40:16.982 --> 40:19.551
That's where we found the body
of your victim.

40:21.152 --> 40:24.322
Do you know
how many lives you've destroyed?

40:24.355 --> 40:26.825
Rosemary. Her family.

40:26.858 --> 40:29.427
All those girls you raped.

40:29.461 --> 40:32.163
Levi and Madeline.
Their parents.

40:32.197 --> 40:34.299
I'm sorry.

40:34.332 --> 40:36.468
I can't let you go.

40:36.502 --> 40:40.405
Well, then you'll spend the rest
of your life in prison with me.

40:40.438 --> 40:42.173
No.

40:42.207 --> 40:44.976
No, I won't.

41:05.897 --> 41:07.198
I am pleased to announce

41:07.232 --> 41:09.143
that in conjunction with
the Chicago Police Department,

41:09.167 --> 41:13.505
we have identified the man
who killed Rosemary Lynch.

41:13.539 --> 41:16.441
Shockingly,
it's someone we all know.

41:16.474 --> 41:18.376
Billionaire Rick Zahn.

41:18.409 --> 41:21.547
Mr. Zahn, when faced
with an arrest for murder,

41:21.580 --> 41:24.382
cowardly decided
to end his own life

41:24.415 --> 41:28.053
at the exact spot
he killed Rosemary.

41:28.086 --> 41:29.888
As many of you know,

41:29.921 --> 41:32.958
Rick Zahn was a major
contributor to my campaign

41:32.991 --> 41:36.061
and attempted to influence me
in many ways.

41:36.094 --> 41:38.564
Thankfully, I was able
to see through his guise

41:38.597 --> 41:42.367
and even help
engineer his downfall.

41:43.401 --> 41:45.804
I would like
to publicly apologize

41:45.837 --> 41:47.573
to Madeline Scott...

41:49.174 --> 41:51.409
another innocent victim

41:51.442 --> 41:54.145
in Mr. Zahn's reign of terror.

41:54.179 --> 41:55.747
And with that, Gore Bellows wins

41:55.781 --> 41:58.016
the closely contested
attorney general race

41:58.049 --> 42:00.418
by a comfortable margin.

42:00.451 --> 42:03.521
Man gives one speech
and wins an election.

42:03.555 --> 42:06.091
American politics
is a dark, dark place.

42:06.124 --> 42:08.393
Our goal was to end
his campaign,

42:08.426 --> 42:09.561
and we ultimately failed.

42:11.062 --> 42:15.033
You know, sometimes
you just have to let it go.

42:16.401 --> 42:18.436
The real question is
do you actually believe

42:18.469 --> 42:19.738
that Ravi killed himself?

42:19.771 --> 42:21.573
You don't think it was suicide?

42:21.607 --> 42:23.274
The man was
about to lose everything.

42:23.308 --> 42:24.943
I don't know.

42:24.976 --> 42:26.954
One of his victims
could've knocked him off, right?

42:26.978 --> 42:28.513
You got Linda, Sarah, Heather.

42:28.546 --> 42:30.448
They all knew who he was.

42:30.481 --> 42:32.517
Heather Husband.

42:32.550 --> 42:36.054
Name like that, she's got to be
guilty of something, right?

42:36.087 --> 42:37.522
Yeah, but...

42:37.555 --> 42:39.595
Linda Barrett seems
more like a killer than Heather.

42:39.625 --> 42:41.760
What about Bellows?

42:51.970 --> 42:53.939
At the IDG,

42:53.972 --> 42:57.609
we welcome all
who are searching for the truth.

42:57.643 --> 43:00.612
Our mission in life
is to free the innocent.

43:00.646 --> 43:02.614
To protect those who are victims

43:02.648 --> 43:04.382
of what can sometimes be

43:04.415 --> 43:07.252
a corrupt and unfair system.

43:09.354 --> 43:13.124
Every day, we will break
the shackles of injustice,

43:13.158 --> 43:16.327
and we will find freedom...

43:16.361 --> 43:18.797
one case at a time.

44:05.711 --> 44:08.680
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH.

44:10.048 --> 44:12.059
You've seen the fight
for justice on Proven Innocent.

44:12.083 --> 44:14.485
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:17.055 --> 44:19.725
Rule number one
if you want to stay alive.

44:19.758 --> 44:21.659
Don't lie to your doctor.

44:24.863 --> 44:27.899
- Profits over patients, again.
- You save your morality lesson.

44:27.933 --> 44:29.267
You have to save him!

44:29.367 --> 44:31.369
Be careful.

44:31.402 --> 44:33.404
- You tried to kill him.
- I had no choice!

44:37.408 --> 44:38.777
Shall we?

44:41.713 --> 44:44.883
The Resident,
all new, Mondays at 800 on Fox.

44:48.553 --> 44:50.388
As they began
their hours of duty...

44:51.790 --> 44:54.592
it was a bell
that started it off.

44:55.761 --> 44:58.296
Each alarm was sounded
by a bell...

44:58.396 --> 45:01.066
that called them to place
their lives in jeopardy...

45:01.099 --> 45:04.202
for the good
of their fellow man.

45:04.235 --> 45:06.805
When the alarm had come
to an end,

45:06.905 --> 45:09.574
the bell rang,
to signal that end.

45:09.607 --> 45:11.977
9-1-1? What is your emergency?

45:12.077 --> 45:17.248
9-1-1. All new,
Mondays at 900 on Fox.
