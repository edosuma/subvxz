00:02.600 --> 00:04.280
Mother is better now, Mayor.

00:04.520 --> 00:08.189
And thanks again. I know family
emergencies are never convenient.

00:09.060 --> 00:13.030
But after some personal reflection,
I realized I have to be with her.

00:14.280 --> 00:16.030
Everything I am started with her.

00:18.990 --> 00:20.950
- You sure you weren't followed?
- Yes.

00:21.370 --> 00:22.370
Good.

00:23.750 --> 00:26.750
- You've changed your appearance.
- The suit is necessary.

00:27.210 --> 00:30.380
The properties inside of it help me
continue my acclimation process

00:30.460 --> 00:32.460
when I'm outside
the reflection modulation chamber.

00:33.550 --> 00:37.130
Now... it's time to get rid
of my husband.

00:37.680 --> 00:41.220
We begin by dismantling
everything that protects him.

00:42.560 --> 00:46.480
- You know where to start.
- Success is assured.

01:09.120 --> 01:10.770
Guys, shouldn't it be all hands on deck

01:10.790 --> 01:13.130
with Iris, Kamilla and Singh
stuck in the Mirrorverse?

01:13.210 --> 01:14.840
Hey, you're just as important.

01:15.210 --> 01:17.420
Found this. Caitlin or Frost?

01:17.760 --> 01:20.340
They're going to the Arctic,
not OzzFest.

01:20.430 --> 01:21.970
How are you so bad at everything?

01:22.180 --> 01:23.950
Caity keeps her heavy coats
in the back closet.

01:23.970 --> 01:26.930
- I'll check on it.
- Right. That makes more sense.

01:27.020 --> 01:28.980
You're so good at this kind of stuff.

01:29.060 --> 01:31.150
- Still mad at me?
- Little bit.

01:31.230 --> 01:32.940
Nash, Allegra will come
around eventually.

01:33.020 --> 01:34.780
You just have to be there when she does.

01:35.110 --> 01:36.150
Trust the process.

01:37.440 --> 01:39.410
- Pretty wise for a Popsicle.
- Thanks.

01:39.610 --> 01:41.370
Got a Dib-ploma to prove it.

01:42.120 --> 01:43.160
Ba-dum-pum.

01:44.370 --> 01:48.250
- Uh... Cool. Can I borrow this?
- Sure.

01:49.830 --> 01:52.540
- I'm really gonna miss you.
- Me, too.

01:52.840 --> 01:53.920
Hm?

01:56.920 --> 01:59.680
I mean, all... We all are.

02:00.470 --> 02:04.010
- Aw. There's hope for you yet.
- Enough. Okay.

02:05.890 --> 02:06.890
Hey, you stay frosty.

02:12.770 --> 02:17.820
- I'm fine.
- No, you're not, and, honey, it's okay.

02:18.360 --> 02:20.910
I promise you, you can handle anything.

02:21.450 --> 02:23.780
You just got to remember,
she's your mom, too.

02:23.990 --> 02:24.990
Of course I am.

02:28.120 --> 02:29.660
Hi, Killer Frost.

02:30.830 --> 02:32.000
Uh...

02:32.670 --> 02:33.830
It's just Frost now.

02:35.040 --> 02:36.040
Hi.

02:36.300 --> 02:39.720
Okay, uh...
We're gonna leave you two alone.

02:42.220 --> 02:44.350
Give us a call
when you get settled in the north.

02:47.970 --> 02:49.430
Mm.

02:51.940 --> 02:52.940
Give 'em hell.

02:58.730 --> 02:59.730
So...

03:01.650 --> 03:04.370
I think I should run a few tests
before we leave.

03:05.240 --> 03:08.040
Check your baseline
for any ribonucleic anomalies.

03:10.960 --> 03:11.960
Great.

03:16.040 --> 03:18.500
Eva's been missing for over 24 hours.

03:18.590 --> 03:21.760
- Where are we with facial recognition?
- Satellites have turned up zilch.

03:22.470 --> 03:24.270
The artificial Speed Force
isn't finished yet,

03:24.300 --> 03:26.640
so I still can't do
my usual sweeps of the city.

03:26.720 --> 03:30.100
- Right. Why are we meeting here?
- I have a backlog of cases.

03:30.180 --> 03:33.140
I can't lose my CSI job
along with everything else.

03:36.270 --> 03:37.270
A job.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.860
Eva said that she had
unfinished business.

03:42.240 --> 03:45.200
Is there any way
that she meant that literally?

03:45.910 --> 03:49.160
If she wants to get McCulloch back,
she does have to deal with Black Hole.

03:49.240 --> 03:52.750
- So, find Black Hole, find Eva.
- Mm-hm.

03:52.960 --> 03:55.250
- Any idea where to start?
- Actually, no.

03:57.040 --> 03:58.040
Maybe.

03:58.170 --> 03:59.250
- Ralph?
- Ralph.

03:59.380 --> 04:00.520
- Where did you get that?
- Where did you get that?

04:00.550 --> 04:01.980
- Sue gave it to me.
- She gave you that?

04:02.010 --> 04:03.810
- She gave that to you?
- She gave that to me.

04:04.680 --> 04:08.640
And it turns out that Black Hole's logo
is embedded inside.

04:08.850 --> 04:12.060
Dude, there is serious UV energy
coming off that thing. Can I?

04:21.399 --> 04:22.400
Oh, yeah.

04:22.480 --> 04:24.030
This is a Triangulation Cartograph.

04:26.820 --> 04:27.820
It's a treasure map.

04:29.660 --> 04:31.990
Allegra, aim it over this.

04:39.210 --> 04:40.750
The center's at 42nd and Darby.

04:41.170 --> 04:42.170
Hang on.

04:43.050 --> 04:44.130
42nd and Darby.

04:45.170 --> 04:46.510
- Holy heck.
- What?

04:46.680 --> 04:49.140
Well, it turns out
that is a ginormous warehouse

04:49.220 --> 04:51.760
with five subterranean levels.

04:51.850 --> 04:53.830
Ralph and I will check it out.
You two, take comms.

04:56.810 --> 04:58.480
Just... excuse me.

05:05.110 --> 05:06.400
Could be a long night.

05:06.490 --> 05:08.300
- I made us a couple of coffees.
- I hate coffee.

05:08.320 --> 05:10.200
No coffee.

05:10.700 --> 05:12.680
<i>- Guys, we're in.
- All right, be careful.</i>

05:12.700 --> 05:14.100
<i>Place like that
could have a guard or two.</i>

05:14.120 --> 05:15.200
More like five.

05:16.790 --> 05:18.210
They were all stabbed.

05:18.290 --> 05:20.250
By a mirror-bayonet, I'm guessing.

05:21.540 --> 05:25.010
That is a lot of bad guy stuff.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.080
It's Black Hole's depository.

05:35.220 --> 05:37.680
Sue said that Carver
was blackmailing her parents.

05:38.980 --> 05:41.520
This is bank statements,
investment records.

05:42.360 --> 05:44.530
This must be everything
that Carver has on them.

05:46.030 --> 05:47.900
- I'm taking this.
- All right.

05:49.780 --> 05:51.160
Smells like gasoline in here.

05:56.120 --> 05:59.250
- Singh?
- I don't want to hurt anyone else.

06:01.130 --> 06:04.170
- Tell that to those guards you killed.
- They left me no choice.

06:05.130 --> 06:06.800
I have to assure Eva's success.

06:06.880 --> 06:10.220
Just put down the flare gun.
Help us bring Carver to justice.

06:11.760 --> 06:14.300
Mother's not interested
in your brand of justice.

06:14.890 --> 06:16.310
Singh. Singh!

06:18.060 --> 06:20.060
- This isn't you.
- You still don't get it, do you?

06:21.980 --> 06:23.810
<i>Carver was there that night.</i>

06:27.110 --> 06:28.570
<i>He let the mirror keep her.</i>

06:29.490 --> 06:30.820
He never tried to rescue her.

06:31.110 --> 06:33.620
Instead, he sold her tech
to the highest bidder...

06:34.450 --> 06:37.240
for weapons, blackmail or worse.

06:38.370 --> 06:42.330
And that is why Carver... is a dead man.

06:53.760 --> 06:54.760
It's not working.

07:01.230 --> 07:02.230
Guys...

07:04.100 --> 07:05.810
<i>Allen, Dibny, are you guys there?</i>

07:05.900 --> 07:06.900
Barely.

07:08.940 --> 07:11.650
- What do we do now?
- The only thing we can.

07:13.280 --> 07:14.360
Protect Carver.

07:22.710 --> 07:24.140
And our guy
knows to destroy anything

07:24.170 --> 07:25.570
that could tie me to the warehouse?

07:25.710 --> 07:28.130
Yes, but there's nothing
left to destroy.

07:28.210 --> 07:29.920
Everything we had was incinerated.

07:30.380 --> 07:32.630
Replace the items, quickly and quietly.

07:32.880 --> 07:35.340
Don't use The Three.
They can't know they're off-leash.

07:35.430 --> 07:37.710
If someone is coming after me,
I'll need their protection.

07:39.770 --> 07:41.390
Hello, Officer Allen.

07:47.110 --> 07:48.110
Please.

07:49.400 --> 07:53.070
You're not here to slap me, are you?
Captain West went for the left side.

07:53.530 --> 07:54.530
How is he, by the way?

07:55.660 --> 07:57.450
Look, there's no easy way
to say this, so...

07:59.530 --> 08:04.000
Your wife wants to kill you,
but C.C.P.D. can keep you safe.

08:04.790 --> 08:06.000
My wife is dead.

08:07.210 --> 08:09.960
Eva's been trapped in another dimension
for the last six years.

08:10.050 --> 08:11.290
A place called the Mirrorverse.

08:13.260 --> 08:14.380
But you already knew that.

08:17.970 --> 08:20.810
If Eva did escape that wretched place,
I'd know.

08:22.140 --> 08:23.810
This is about your wife, isn't it?

08:25.190 --> 08:29.480
I came across this footage from
my wife's office a couple of weeks ago.

08:35.360 --> 08:36.530
Ooh.

08:37.159 --> 08:40.240
- You knew Iris was abducted?
- Your wife was a problem.

08:41.330 --> 08:43.500
Her disappearance was fortuitous.

08:44.830 --> 08:47.550
- What happened to my wife?
- The same thing that happened to my Eva.

08:48.500 --> 08:51.000
- She's gone. They both are.
- No.

08:51.920 --> 08:54.640
- There has to be a way to get her back.
- I used to think that, too.

08:55.880 --> 08:57.930
But if Iris is still alive in there,

08:59.180 --> 09:01.180
there's probably
nothing left of her to save.

09:01.930 --> 09:04.560
I had the most brilliant minds
in the world study that...

09:06.350 --> 09:07.600
Mirrorverse.

09:08.020 --> 09:12.570
You know what they found?
It's incompatible with the human brain.

09:13.360 --> 09:17.530
That place warps the mind until
the person is no longer recognizable.

09:18.780 --> 09:22.080
Your Iris is long gone.

09:23.120 --> 09:26.410
I suggest you accept that and move on.

09:29.750 --> 09:31.590
Oh, one more thing.

09:32.790 --> 09:34.590
How do you know Eva's coming after me?

09:34.960 --> 09:36.880
Who else would've burnt down
your warehouse?

09:38.010 --> 09:42.140
- 42nd and Darby, right?
- I'd never buy on that side of town.

09:43.760 --> 09:45.270
And I don't need protecting.

09:47.730 --> 09:49.270
Give Captain West my best.

09:57.150 --> 09:59.950
Without the satellites,
finding Chief Singh feels impossible.

10:00.530 --> 10:01.450
I know.

10:01.450 --> 10:02.910
We'll have to go find him ourselves.

10:05.080 --> 10:08.500
Every time I interact with this place,
the neural dissonance gets worse.

10:11.170 --> 10:12.500
And what if Eva comes back?

10:13.710 --> 10:14.710
Then what?

10:15.170 --> 10:17.630
Look, things in this place
may be backwards,

10:17.710 --> 10:21.090
but everything works.
We just have to figure out how.

10:30.350 --> 10:31.730
Did you see the map of the city?

10:31.810 --> 10:33.860
You just said looking at those
was too dangerous.

10:33.940 --> 10:34.900
No, I didn't mean to.

10:34.900 --> 10:37.610
But I was thinking about finding David,

10:37.690 --> 10:39.650
and the map came into view.

10:40.780 --> 10:43.070
There was thermal energy
coming from a specific place.

10:43.160 --> 10:44.920
I'm not sure where,
but that has to be David.

10:45.740 --> 10:48.540
There was like a radius,
almost like a beacon.

10:49.080 --> 10:51.790
I feel like if I could just focus,
I can find his location.

10:51.870 --> 10:53.290
No, Iris, come on. Look at you.

10:53.380 --> 10:55.290
No, I'm acclimating
to this place, Kamilla,

10:55.380 --> 10:57.460
that's why I can see the map,
and you can't.

10:58.670 --> 11:00.300
I can find David.

11:05.720 --> 11:07.350
- Mrs. Dearbon.
- Hi.

11:07.850 --> 11:11.480
Mr. Dearbon, so great to see you again.
I have fantastic news.

11:11.730 --> 11:13.730
- So, it turns out that...
- Oh.

11:14.600 --> 11:18.610
So you are the person
my parents employed to find me.

11:19.440 --> 11:21.320
It's so good to meet you.

11:23.360 --> 11:28.120
And please forgive me.
I never meant to cause a stir.

11:28.200 --> 11:29.540
I read <i>Eat Pray Love,</i>

11:29.620 --> 11:32.120
and I took the "pray" part
just a little bit too seriously.

11:34.880 --> 11:37.590
Our Susie joined
a mindfulness retreat in India.

11:38.420 --> 11:39.630
I meant to stay for a month,

11:39.710 --> 11:42.260
and then lost track
of the weeks, months...

11:43.090 --> 11:45.470
Well, it happens, right?

11:45.800 --> 11:49.060
Mr. Dibny, while we're delighted
to have our Susie back,

11:49.140 --> 11:51.180
we realize how much trouble you went to.

11:53.100 --> 11:54.020
Do you have a pen?

11:54.020 --> 11:55.100
Uh...

11:58.320 --> 12:00.030
Oh, heck, wouldn't you know.
I'm fresh out.

12:00.110 --> 12:02.360
Let me just check that hallway closet.
Ms. Dearbon,

12:02.440 --> 12:04.860
- could you help me look for a pen?
- Oh, of course.

12:04.950 --> 12:06.660
We'll be right back.

12:06.740 --> 12:08.280
Do you need a legal pad or anything?

12:10.660 --> 12:12.250
Why would you call my parents?

12:12.330 --> 12:13.680
So, that diamond that you gave me,

12:13.710 --> 12:16.120
it turns out it has a map
for Black Hole's stash house.

12:16.210 --> 12:17.210
I did some recon...

12:17.290 --> 12:18.340
Oh!

12:18.420 --> 12:21.800
I thought breaking and entering
was a line Elongated Man didn't cross.

12:21.880 --> 12:22.880
Would you...

12:23.170 --> 12:25.030
- Inside voices, please.
- I'm sorry.

12:25.050 --> 12:27.550
Look, Carver had files with
your parents' names on them.

12:27.640 --> 12:30.060
Those files contain the evidence
he was using to extort them.

12:30.140 --> 12:33.560
- What do you mean, "had"?
- Well, things got toasty,

12:33.770 --> 12:35.890
and Carver's blackmail arsenal
got cooked.

12:36.900 --> 12:40.070
- You torched the place?
- No. I... No.

12:41.110 --> 12:42.780
Okay. How do I say this?

12:43.320 --> 12:46.320
There's a Mirrorverse dimension.
There's these pod people running around.

12:46.400 --> 12:50.160
They're claiming innocent lives.
It's very <i>Invasion of the Body...</i>

12:50.240 --> 12:52.350
You know what? Why don't
we just forget about that part?

12:52.370 --> 12:54.250
The point is, your parents are safe.

12:54.330 --> 12:55.580
Yeah. Already knew that.

12:55.960 --> 12:57.370
You're welcome. It was really no...

12:57.460 --> 12:59.540
- Wait, what?
- Yeah, Carver called last week.

13:00.250 --> 13:01.310
Said he had a change of heart.

13:01.340 --> 13:04.130
Guys like Carver
don't have hearts to change.

13:04.210 --> 13:05.210
Agreed.

13:06.720 --> 13:10.220
But my parents are safe,
and I can finally go home.

13:12.100 --> 13:15.020
- I don't understand. If we agree...
- Enough, Slick.

13:16.270 --> 13:17.350
You really wanna help me?

13:19.190 --> 13:20.190
Leave us in peace.

13:34.240 --> 13:36.290
Did he say who wants
his head on a pike now?

14:09.030 --> 14:10.030
Who's there?

14:10.860 --> 14:11.910
Hello, Kimiyo.

14:12.740 --> 14:15.910
Shall we do this the easy way...
or the hard way?

14:33.470 --> 14:34.470
Sunshine?

14:46.860 --> 14:47.860
Hoshi?

14:52.110 --> 14:53.110
Ultraviolet?

15:20.930 --> 15:22.390
I'm glad Carver turned you down.

15:22.480 --> 15:24.940
After what he did
to my cousin, Joe, Iris,

15:25.020 --> 15:26.060
he deserves what he gets.

15:26.150 --> 15:28.110
He doesn't deserve to die.

15:28.190 --> 15:31.070
But what if he's telling the truth about
the Mirrorverse affecting minds?

15:31.150 --> 15:34.360
Or he's lying.
He's not exactly the Paragon of Truth.

15:34.660 --> 15:35.660
I don't think he's lying.

15:35.910 --> 15:37.580
I think it could be neural dissonance.

15:39.120 --> 15:40.790
I came across this Earth on my travels

15:40.870 --> 15:42.210
where any visitor to that Earth

15:42.290 --> 15:44.710
immediately suffers
a traumatic psychological state,

15:44.790 --> 15:45.790
neural dissonance.

15:47.090 --> 15:48.090
This could be that.

15:48.210 --> 15:49.730
I'm glad someone believes me.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.220
I need your help after all, Allen.

15:53.840 --> 15:56.220
Federal protection.
The full Joe West treatment.

15:56.300 --> 15:57.800
What happened to your killer minions?

16:00.390 --> 16:02.910
- Eva got to them first, didn't she?
- You gonna help me or not?

16:04.890 --> 16:08.230
Look, get me into protection,
and Joe can get out of it.

16:08.900 --> 16:11.220
One call from me, and he's sleeping
in his own bed tonight.

16:11.280 --> 16:13.650
You're a real piece of work,
you know that?

16:14.400 --> 16:15.950
That sounded like a "yes" to me.

16:20.490 --> 16:22.040
Huh. That's interesting.

16:22.830 --> 16:26.460
The stoichiometric ratio is manifesting
in a way that's abnormal.

16:28.250 --> 16:32.880
It'd be so much easier
if Caitlin were here to help analyze.

16:33.550 --> 16:34.550
I can help.

16:36.050 --> 16:41.140
Oh, I'm sorry. I just meant that
I could use an expert in meta-DNA.

16:44.020 --> 16:47.480
- I forgot.
- I figured.

16:48.900 --> 16:51.860
Probably because every time
you look at me, you just see Thomas...

16:52.230 --> 16:53.530
and the monster he became.

16:57.070 --> 16:58.160
You're not a monster.

17:03.660 --> 17:05.829
You protected Caitlin from her father

17:05.910 --> 17:09.460
and then some, which is a hell
of a lot more than I ever did.

17:13.050 --> 17:14.050
You know, to be honest,

17:14.800 --> 17:16.550
I always kind of
felt like a third wheel.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.140
I'm sorry you felt that way.

17:21.510 --> 17:23.260
No. No.

17:24.849 --> 17:26.099
That must have been horrible.

17:28.190 --> 17:32.480
Then again, I've made
so many mistakes in my life.

17:32.570 --> 17:35.780
Maybe I'm the one who needs fixing.

17:36.690 --> 17:40.780
You're a brilliant scientist who runs
the most successful lab on the planet.

17:41.660 --> 17:43.030
I don't think you need fixing.

17:43.450 --> 17:47.460
'Cause from where I'm standing,
you're a pretty awesome human being.

17:48.790 --> 17:50.460
One I'd like to get to know
a lot better.

17:54.090 --> 17:55.170
I'd like that, too.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.390
What is taking so long?

18:02.470 --> 18:04.240
Federal agents
will be here any minute

18:04.260 --> 18:06.060
to take you into custody.

18:08.890 --> 18:09.940
Officer.

18:10.230 --> 18:11.230
Mr. Carver.

18:12.060 --> 18:15.780
When your paperwork came across my desk,
I thought a VIP such as yourself

18:15.860 --> 18:17.860
shouldn't have to ride
in a two-bit government van.

18:18.990 --> 18:21.570
So I'm here to escort you personally
into custody.

18:22.950 --> 18:24.740
Allen. A word?

18:32.830 --> 18:36.670
Let me walk out of here with Carver,
and Mother will give you Iris.

18:38.550 --> 18:41.590
Eva is not interested in a fight
with you or with your friends.

18:42.550 --> 18:45.180
You knew we were in that warehouse
when you set it on fire.

18:46.060 --> 18:48.980
- That feels like a fight to me.
- Let me have him, Barry.

18:50.270 --> 18:51.270
He's a bad man.

18:52.310 --> 18:53.400
Bring Iris home.

18:55.360 --> 18:56.440
Get your life back.

18:57.690 --> 18:58.900
Are we doing this, or what?

19:03.780 --> 19:05.330
- On my six!
- What the hell?

19:12.290 --> 19:14.880
Will someone please tell me
what the hell is going on?

19:14.960 --> 19:17.050
I saved you. That's what's going on.

19:17.340 --> 19:18.550
- Nash.
- What?

19:22.180 --> 19:26.470
The Barry Allen I know would never,
never have considered that deal.

19:48.530 --> 19:50.290
I knew Eva was ambitious, but...

19:51.080 --> 19:52.120
mirror duplicates?

19:52.210 --> 19:53.870
Eva's more powerful than you thought.

19:54.080 --> 19:55.000
I don't get it.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.720
Why doesn't she just
come after you herself?

19:56.790 --> 20:00.090
Well, Eva's still technically missing,
so she can't be seen in public.

20:00.250 --> 20:01.300
That's why she took Singh.

20:02.050 --> 20:03.760
The Chief of Police
could get close to you.

20:05.590 --> 20:07.970
Fortunately, Mr. Wells
teleported us to safety.

20:09.060 --> 20:10.060
You're welcome.

20:11.470 --> 20:14.940
What is that device?
And how much do you want for it?

20:15.020 --> 20:18.560
- It's not for sale, dirtbag.
- Oh, please.

20:18.650 --> 20:19.900
Everyone has a price.

20:19.980 --> 20:22.800
Hey, listen. We just saved your kiester,
so why don't you put a sock in it

20:22.820 --> 20:24.540
until we can figure out
what to do with you.

20:27.280 --> 20:29.870
So, guess we're stuck
with our new guest for a while.

20:29.950 --> 20:32.040
It's only a matter of time
before Eva shows up here.

20:32.200 --> 20:33.120
Right.

20:33.120 --> 20:34.600
Any mirrored surface
inside S.T.A.R. Labs

20:34.620 --> 20:35.930
is a door for her to walk through.

20:35.960 --> 20:37.880
McCulloch's security system
can protect us.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.210
I have a panic room
Eva doesn't know about.

20:40.290 --> 20:42.460
No offense,
but extra guards and a lockdown

20:42.550 --> 20:43.870
aren't going to help us out here.

20:45.170 --> 20:47.510
I have a biogenic ionization field

20:47.590 --> 20:49.800
that can be activated
around the entire facility.

20:50.350 --> 20:52.970
Anything breaking in
would be atomized in a second.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.230
We just have to get there.

20:56.140 --> 20:59.560
We could take the sewage system,
pop out right underneath R&D.

21:01.860 --> 21:02.860
I break into things.

21:03.440 --> 21:04.570
Hmm.

21:05.110 --> 21:06.240
No time like the present.

21:15.660 --> 21:16.660
Allen.

21:19.170 --> 21:20.290
I wanna ask you a question.

21:22.050 --> 21:25.170
You knew that Carver
was in mortal danger, right,

21:25.260 --> 21:27.630
soon as Mirror Singh
stepped off that elevator?

21:27.720 --> 21:29.260
Why didn't you get him out of there?

21:30.640 --> 21:32.800
I couldn't exactly run him out of there
as Barry Allen.

21:32.850 --> 21:33.970
Or he offered you a deal.

21:36.180 --> 21:37.390
That's the other thing.

21:37.850 --> 21:40.150
I have all these Wellses in my head,
and they all...

21:40.480 --> 21:41.540
They're all screaming the same thing,

21:41.560 --> 21:44.030
that the Barry Allen they knew
would never have hesitated.

21:45.230 --> 21:46.230
You did.

21:47.950 --> 21:49.160
You were considering...

21:50.320 --> 21:51.320
the deal.

21:51.740 --> 21:54.410
You were considering trading
Carver's life to save Iris.

21:54.490 --> 21:55.510
It's more complicated than that.

21:55.540 --> 21:57.680
It's more complicated?
Is it complicated like in the way

21:57.710 --> 21:59.830
you almost killed Eobard Thawne,
and me along with it?

21:59.920 --> 22:01.100
- That was different.
- How is that different?

22:01.130 --> 22:03.130
Iris is my wife. I have to save her.

22:04.300 --> 22:05.710
How do you not understand that?

22:05.800 --> 22:06.800
I do.

22:08.970 --> 22:11.680
But what do you think Iris will say...

22:13.430 --> 22:16.520
when you tell her you traded
another person's life to save hers?

22:34.120 --> 22:36.480
A.R.G.U.S. will be here in an hour
to take you into custody.

22:39.160 --> 22:40.460
Wait, this isn't safe.

22:40.540 --> 22:42.630
Relax, after I saw what happened
to your wife,

22:42.710 --> 22:44.340
I had it coated with protective nanites.

22:45.170 --> 22:47.760
I thought Palmer Tech
and McCulloch were rivals.

22:49.260 --> 22:51.970
Let's just say, what Palmer Tech
doesn't know won't hurt them.

22:55.890 --> 22:57.180
And this is my panic room.

22:58.100 --> 23:00.310
Concrete walls
and not a mirror in sight.

23:01.480 --> 23:03.980
Even if my outer field fails,
Eva can't get in here.

23:07.150 --> 23:10.150
Once the building's clear,
you can engage your ion field.

23:11.860 --> 23:14.030
Then tell your people
to speed up the evacuation.

23:18.910 --> 23:20.910
You don't have to go home,
but you can't stay here.

23:24.210 --> 23:25.250
Allegra, here.

23:25.920 --> 23:27.750
Take this, just in case.

23:27.840 --> 23:31.010
All right? Any trouble, you should
blast it with one of your UV rays.

23:31.170 --> 23:32.970
All right?
Provide a welcome distraction.

23:33.760 --> 23:35.050
When are you gonna stop trying?

23:37.100 --> 23:38.100
Never.

23:48.900 --> 23:50.190
What the hell?

24:00.410 --> 24:01.540
I knew you were lying.

24:02.080 --> 24:03.830
You really can't take a hint.

24:03.920 --> 24:05.630
You're not here to rob the place.

24:06.790 --> 24:09.380
And Carver didn't have a change of heart
on your parents. You...

24:10.000 --> 24:11.800
You offered to take their place
in Black Hole.

24:11.880 --> 24:13.050
Carver agrees.

24:14.050 --> 24:15.590
I'm more valuable than my parents.

24:17.930 --> 24:18.970
Sue, you...

24:20.510 --> 24:21.530
You don't have to do this.

24:21.560 --> 24:25.140
Yes, I do. I have been trying to collect
leverage on Carver for over a year.

24:26.150 --> 24:27.150
He's untouchable.

24:29.230 --> 24:34.030
Untouchable unless you have one of those
handy-dandy Black Hole pins.

24:34.650 --> 24:37.370
You joined Black Hole
to get close to Carver.

24:38.910 --> 24:40.230
Because you're going to kill him.

24:41.540 --> 24:43.080
That's why you're here, isn't it?

24:43.160 --> 24:45.160
Carver's never going to
let my parents go.

24:45.250 --> 24:46.750
Sue... damn it.

24:46.830 --> 24:47.750
It's the only way it ends.

24:47.750 --> 24:51.000
You gotta listen to me.
There is always another way.

24:51.090 --> 24:53.800
Do you understand what happens
if you kill Carver?

24:53.880 --> 24:55.190
Every time you look in the mirror,

24:55.220 --> 24:57.340
you won't recognize
the person looking back.

24:57.430 --> 24:59.180
- You'll lose yourself.
- Why do you care?

24:59.260 --> 25:00.350
Because I believe in you.

25:02.680 --> 25:04.180
And I know there's still good in you.

25:06.390 --> 25:07.390
I can see it.

25:10.310 --> 25:11.900
I'm sorry about this, Slick.

25:19.070 --> 25:21.120
Oh, come on.

25:24.700 --> 25:27.470
<i>All clear down here.
Ready for the force field when you are.</i>

25:35.260 --> 25:36.670
The ion field's up and running.

25:37.510 --> 25:39.680
Now all that's left to do
is sit and wait.

25:40.680 --> 25:41.680
Cheers.

25:56.570 --> 25:57.570
That's not good.

25:58.820 --> 26:00.870
Guys, the force field
isn't working anymore.

26:01.280 --> 26:03.240
Can we find out what happened
to the power source?

26:05.580 --> 26:06.830
We know what happened.

26:22.470 --> 26:23.990
Carver's Angels invited themselves
to the party.

26:31.440 --> 26:33.060
Something Carver never did.

26:33.310 --> 26:34.730
We're no longer under his thumb.

26:35.270 --> 26:36.400
Neither is Eva.

26:36.480 --> 26:38.650
Whatever she is paying you,
I will double it.

26:38.740 --> 26:40.450
This isn't about a paycheck.

26:40.530 --> 26:41.740
It's about payback.

26:45.910 --> 26:48.000
Eva's coming for you, Carver.

26:48.410 --> 26:51.330
And we're gonna make sure
no one gets in her way.

27:09.480 --> 27:10.880
Nice family reunion.

27:12.400 --> 27:15.280
Eva's going to be here any minute.
We have to get your ion field back up.

27:15.650 --> 27:17.890
- Is there an alternate power source?
- The sub-basement.

27:17.980 --> 27:20.190
There's remote access
to a secondary generator.

27:20.280 --> 27:23.010
Guys, hold them off as long as you can,
I'm going to get the power back on.

27:23.030 --> 27:25.490
You do that.
I know how to handle traitors.

27:37.290 --> 27:38.290
Drop your weapons.

27:42.340 --> 27:43.340
Singh.

27:44.640 --> 27:47.260
You don't want to do this.
This isn't your will.

27:49.430 --> 27:51.810
Eva's will is my will.

28:12.160 --> 28:14.120
Success is assured.

28:36.810 --> 28:38.210
I thought Sunshine was solar powered?

28:38.230 --> 28:40.320
So how the frak is she
frying people at night?

28:40.400 --> 28:42.490
Those bracelets aren't fashion,
they're fuel.

28:42.570 --> 28:44.150
They're solar energy battery packs.

28:45.570 --> 28:46.490
Well, how do we get them off?

28:46.490 --> 28:49.090
Just got to increase the internal
temperature, overload the cells.

28:49.160 --> 28:50.590
- Allegra, if you...
- Already on it.

28:50.620 --> 28:52.100
- She's good.
- What are you gonna do?

28:52.120 --> 28:53.680
I don't know. I'm making it up as I go.

29:38.920 --> 29:40.330
Fine, do it.

29:40.540 --> 29:42.230
You think you're the only one
that feels that way?

29:42.250 --> 29:43.590
The only one that feels alone?

29:43.710 --> 29:44.710
Well, get in line!

29:52.850 --> 29:56.310
Okay, remember when I told you,
if things go sideways, zap the stone?

29:56.390 --> 29:57.770
- Yeah.
- I'd zap the stone.

30:18.750 --> 30:19.750
You came back.

30:20.250 --> 30:21.610
Couldn't let you have all the fun.

30:21.920 --> 30:24.920
Fun must mean something
entirely different when you're rich.

30:52.450 --> 30:55.330
Honey, I'm home.

31:06.460 --> 31:08.420
Guess somebody forgot
to spike the punch.

31:26.020 --> 31:27.190
Let's talk about this.

31:30.280 --> 31:31.360
About what?

31:32.660 --> 31:35.070
How you weaponized my technology?

31:35.950 --> 31:38.240
Extorted charitable donors?

31:39.120 --> 31:42.330
Kidnapped and blackmailed
innocent meta-humans

31:42.410 --> 31:45.130
like Kimiyo, Esperanza and Millie?

31:45.290 --> 31:47.840
This is me talking.

31:48.050 --> 31:49.510
I did what I had to do.

32:00.520 --> 32:02.180
Then I'll do what I have to do.

32:04.020 --> 32:05.690
Goodbye, Joseph.

32:08.070 --> 32:09.440
No, Eva! Wait!

32:12.860 --> 32:14.030
No!

32:14.570 --> 32:17.740
What don't you understand?
He's not worth saving!

32:19.160 --> 32:23.620
Maybe,
but it's not your decision.

32:25.330 --> 32:27.670
Oh, yes, it is.

32:36.800 --> 32:39.010
My husband...

32:40.140 --> 32:44.270
let me rot in that world for years.

32:45.020 --> 32:48.310
He does not get to live in this one.

32:51.190 --> 32:53.990
You're not my wife.

32:55.570 --> 33:00.080
My wife died
in the particle accelerator explosion.

33:04.910 --> 33:05.910
Well...

33:07.620 --> 33:09.750
I've never felt more alive.

33:10.710 --> 33:15.300
You're not even... human.

33:20.970 --> 33:22.970
No. Oh, no.

33:26.850 --> 33:28.060
I'm sorry you had to see that.

33:32.520 --> 33:33.650
God.

33:39.950 --> 33:41.870
What are you doing here?

33:42.160 --> 33:43.290
I'm making this up as I go.

33:43.950 --> 33:44.950
Right.

33:45.700 --> 33:46.700
Flash...

33:47.040 --> 33:50.540
Barry, you and I are not enemies.

33:51.170 --> 33:52.420
We never have been.

33:53.340 --> 33:55.340
You just killed him in cold blood.

33:56.130 --> 33:59.550
Your wife set out to catch a bad man.

34:00.930 --> 34:02.050
She couldn't.

34:04.260 --> 34:05.720
But together, we could.

34:06.560 --> 34:08.389
- We're on the same side.
- No.

34:09.350 --> 34:10.690
Just remember that.

34:10.940 --> 34:12.940
All right, on three,
everybody go crazy.

34:13.110 --> 34:14.020
Got it.

34:14.030 --> 34:15.400
That seems like bad advice.

34:15.480 --> 34:18.449
Song title. No, I like it.
It'll be good. All right.

34:18.860 --> 34:21.280
One, two...

34:21.909 --> 34:22.909
<i>Stand down.</i>

34:23.780 --> 34:24.949
<i>Joseph is dead.</i>

34:26.620 --> 34:29.750
Well, I didn't see that coming.

34:30.120 --> 34:31.420
You're going to let us go?

34:31.540 --> 34:32.920
Of course.

34:34.500 --> 34:36.420
I've achieved my goal for today.

34:38.010 --> 34:39.719
We'll never stop coming after you.

34:42.969 --> 34:44.139
You'll fail.

34:45.510 --> 34:48.850
This building, this company...

34:50.690 --> 34:52.190
is all mine.

34:53.860 --> 34:56.650
And you and your little friends
are trespassing, so...

34:57.570 --> 34:59.490
run along, little Barry.

35:00.700 --> 35:02.450
Before I have to call the police.

35:12.830 --> 35:15.250
Mrs. McCulloch,
where have you been all this time?

35:16.130 --> 35:19.760
Well, over the past six years,

35:20.050 --> 35:24.470
I have been held hostage
by an international crime syndicate.

35:25.600 --> 35:27.140
Forced to watch

35:27.220 --> 35:31.020
as they stole my technology
and used it to create deadly weapons.

35:31.890 --> 35:33.150
How did you escape?

35:35.940 --> 35:38.070
My husband, Joseph...

35:39.030 --> 35:41.400
he worked tirelessly to try to find me.

35:41.490 --> 35:44.320
And he succeeded.

35:46.530 --> 35:49.830
Only to be murdered
moments after we were reunited.

35:52.960 --> 35:55.000
Words cannot express my sorrow.

35:57.960 --> 36:00.130
But know that I am working
with the C.C.P.D.

36:00.210 --> 36:01.970
to try to find my husband's murderer.

36:02.670 --> 36:07.510
And as for McCulloch Technologies,
I will be resuming my position as CEO,

36:07.970 --> 36:09.560
effective immediately.

36:11.220 --> 36:12.940
It's what Joseph would've wanted.

36:14.900 --> 36:15.980
Thank you.

36:20.980 --> 36:21.990
Going somewhere?

36:22.440 --> 36:23.440
Carver's dead.

36:24.450 --> 36:27.620
Which means my parents are finally free.

36:28.160 --> 36:29.240
So am I.

36:30.700 --> 36:31.700
I'm going home.

36:36.960 --> 36:38.630
Sue, I'm not sure you can.

36:43.420 --> 36:44.680
Eva framed you.

36:51.260 --> 36:52.470
For Carver's murder.

37:09.570 --> 37:12.410
Barry, we've been through
stuff like this before, don't worry.

37:12.740 --> 37:15.080
You're going to find a way
to stop Eva and get Iris back.

37:15.160 --> 37:17.870
I can't even be frustrated without...

37:19.960 --> 37:21.340
losing more of it.

37:25.170 --> 37:27.880
Maybe instead of focusing
on what you've lost,

37:27.970 --> 37:30.390
you should try remembering
what you'll never lose.

37:31.680 --> 37:35.770
The reason you beat
Zoom, Godspeed, Thawne...

37:36.060 --> 37:38.270
is because speed isn't what drives you.

37:39.020 --> 37:40.020
It's love.

37:41.480 --> 37:42.820
That's your true force.

37:44.230 --> 37:46.780
And there is nothing artificial
about that.

37:47.900 --> 37:49.950
So as long as you stay true to yourself,

37:50.030 --> 37:52.280
you will always find a way
to beat the bad guys.

37:53.740 --> 37:55.000
And gals.

37:57.080 --> 37:58.290
I'm going to miss you.

37:59.620 --> 38:01.000
I'll be back before you know it.

38:04.380 --> 38:06.550
All set? The car's downstairs.

38:07.630 --> 38:11.970
I promise I'll get these two back to you
and your team as soon as possible.

38:13.430 --> 38:14.430
Thanks.

38:14.430 --> 38:15.810
Yeah, okay.

38:16.850 --> 38:17.850
Hey...

38:19.600 --> 38:22.020
Frost can hear me too, right?

38:22.860 --> 38:23.900
As long as she's awake.

38:23.980 --> 38:25.190
<i>I'm awake, really.</i>

38:25.730 --> 38:26.730
Go ahead.

38:28.150 --> 38:29.150
Just...

38:29.450 --> 38:30.450
Get better.

38:31.740 --> 38:34.300
And hurry back. We still have
a white water rafting trip to take.

38:35.200 --> 38:36.480
<i>I'm holding you to that.</i>

38:37.040 --> 38:38.370
She says she can't wait.

38:53.010 --> 38:54.550
Tell the team I miss 'em already.

38:57.060 --> 38:58.230
I will.

39:31.340 --> 39:32.470
Well, well.

39:33.890 --> 39:34.890
This is a little quieter.

39:34.970 --> 39:35.970
Yeah.

39:36.430 --> 39:37.720
Hey, look, I know that...

39:39.100 --> 39:41.350
I'm not your favorite person, but...

39:42.480 --> 39:44.100
if ever you need anything,

39:44.400 --> 39:46.570
if ever you need my coffee...

39:46.650 --> 39:48.530
What happened to "I don't like coffee"?

39:49.780 --> 39:50.820
Uh...

39:52.400 --> 39:53.400
Okay.

39:54.820 --> 39:56.160
- Thanks.
- For what?

39:58.410 --> 39:59.410
For this.

40:01.080 --> 40:02.080
Of course.

40:02.910 --> 40:05.080
What did it do to her? My cousin?

40:06.670 --> 40:08.710
It made her relive her worst memory.

40:11.170 --> 40:12.170
You know what?

40:13.970 --> 40:14.970
You hang on to it.

40:15.970 --> 40:17.210
Just in case you need it again.

40:18.720 --> 40:19.720
Hey, guys.

40:20.180 --> 40:21.640
- Hey.
- Thanks for coming.

40:21.730 --> 40:23.640
- Yeah.
- Iris and the others,

40:23.730 --> 40:25.020
they're still Eva's prisoners.

40:25.100 --> 40:26.260
We're going to get them back.

40:26.690 --> 40:28.930
And remember, we still have one thing
that Eva doesn't...

40:29.610 --> 40:30.610
hope.

40:31.280 --> 40:32.860
We also have reinforcements.

40:37.870 --> 40:39.240
- Oh.
- Joe.

40:45.040 --> 40:46.040
How are you here?

40:46.540 --> 40:49.750
Well, it turns out that
when the guy that's trying to kill you

40:49.840 --> 40:51.800
kicks the bucket,
they lift the protection detail.

40:51.880 --> 40:53.380
- That makes sense.
- Nash.

40:53.470 --> 40:55.220
Hey, man. Yeah.

40:56.970 --> 40:58.510
- Hey.
- You're just in time.

40:59.350 --> 41:00.970
Team needs you now more than ever.

41:01.310 --> 41:03.980
Well, let's go save some people we love.

41:12.940 --> 41:14.360
You have been at this for hours.

41:15.110 --> 41:16.110
Barry wouldn't give up.

41:16.280 --> 41:18.080
And the woman
that he married wouldn't either.

41:30.290 --> 41:31.290
I found him.

41:31.800 --> 41:33.380
David's at Central City Hospital.

41:35.090 --> 41:36.380
I can't believe I just did that.

41:36.470 --> 41:38.470
Holy frak!
Iris, you can control this place.

41:43.520 --> 41:44.520
Iris.

41:45.350 --> 41:46.350
Iris, stay with me.

41:49.730 --> 41:50.770
Iris!
