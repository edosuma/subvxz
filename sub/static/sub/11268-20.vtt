                     E-leven and
                        holding.

00:07.107 --> 00:08.073
  Hey, that's a personal best.  

00:08.141 --> 00:09.074
                         Uh-huh.

00:09.175 --> 00:10.142
        What's going on?        

00:10.210 --> 00:11.176
                 We're trying to
                  count how many

00:11.244 --> 00:12.611
                 Spanish peanuts
                    Cliff can...

00:12.746 --> 00:14.480
                fit up his nose.

00:14.547 --> 00:15.748
                      (nasally):
                        And, uh,

00:15.882 --> 00:16.815
    11's the limit.             

00:16.883 --> 00:18.350
  I know my nostrils.           

00:19.853 --> 00:21.453
     Let's see, now, who had 11?

00:21.521 --> 00:22.621
              Uh, Norm Peterson.

00:22.689 --> 00:23.689
            Hey.                
                        Oh, yes,

00:23.757 --> 00:25.657
                I know Cliffie's
                    nostrils.   

00:25.725 --> 00:26.658
Here you go, Norm.              

00:26.726 --> 00:29.028
                      Thank you.
     Cliff, are you crazy?      

00:29.095 --> 00:31.096
  You've really been stuffing   
     peanuts up your nose?      

00:31.164 --> 00:32.531
    That's dangerous.           

00:32.598 --> 00:35.501
You could puncture your sinuses,
 you can even get brain damage. 

00:35.568 --> 00:37.336
 Oh, come on, I've been doing   
 this kind of stuff for years.  

00:37.404 --> 00:38.570
 It's no big deal.              

00:38.638 --> 00:42.408
             Yeah, Cliffie, but,
          uh, but never 11, pal.

00:42.475 --> 00:44.176
 Uh, yeah,                      
 you're right, Norm.            

00:44.244 --> 00:45.511
 Uh, hey,                       
 uh, Rebecca,                   

00:45.578 --> 00:46.745
 I'm gonna mosey                
 into the poolroom              

00:46.813 --> 00:47.913
 and, uh,                       
 pry some of these out.         

00:47.981 --> 00:49.314
 Give me the corkscrew,         
 will you?                      

00:50.350 --> 00:52.851
            Thank you.          

00:54.988 --> 00:56.989
Hey, Norm, that's quite a little
 sum of money you've got there. 

00:57.057 --> 00:57.990
                Yeah, well...   

00:58.058 --> 00:59.391
Maybe you'd like                
to apply                        

00:59.559 --> 01:00.592
 some of this to your bar tab.  

01:00.660 --> 01:01.694
                      (laughing)

01:03.863 --> 01:04.897
            That's very good.   

01:04.964 --> 01:06.031

        starting to fit in here.

          (door opens)          

02:22.308 --> 02:27.212
Sam, let me have a Scotch.      

02:27.280 --> 02:29.615
     Oh, make it a double.      

02:29.683 --> 02:30.683
    Oh, what the hell?          

02:30.750 --> 02:32.785
Just pound me over the head     
with the bottle.                

02:32.852 --> 02:34.053
              Whoo!             

02:34.120 --> 02:35.654
         Tough day, huh?        

02:35.722 --> 02:38.590
No, I'm not unwinding, Sam,     
I'm, I'm bracing up.            

02:38.658 --> 02:40.459
    You see, Lilith's mother    
is coming up from the city      

02:40.527 --> 02:42.127
         for our fifth          
      wedding anniversary,      

02:42.195 --> 02:43.495
     meeting me here.           

02:43.563 --> 02:46.465
I thought I'd come in a         
little early and... marinate.   

02:46.533 --> 02:50.302
        Yeah, mother-in-laws,   
             man, they're tough.

02:50.370 --> 02:51.737
Oh, she's demanding, Sam.       

02:51.805 --> 02:55.341
She's unreasonable,             
cold, sarcastic, bitter.        

02:55.408 --> 02:56.942
Nothing is                      
to her liking ever.             

02:57.010 --> 02:58.177
                  Yeah, we know.

02:58.244 --> 03:00.079
         What's her mother like?

03:01.181 --> 03:03.549
Ah, I suppose it's wrong of me  

03:03.616 --> 03:05.217
to blame Betty                  
for all our problems.           

03:05.285 --> 03:07.720
I'm sure I'm not the way        
she wants me to be either.      

03:07.787 --> 03:09.822
         Well, how does she want
        you to be, Dr. Crane?   

03:09.889 --> 03:12.391
    Well... dead.               

03:12.492 --> 03:14.293
The thing                       
that really drives me crazy     

03:14.361 --> 03:15.327
is the unrelenting tension      

03:15.395 --> 03:17.296
between Lilith                  
and her mother.                 

03:17.364 --> 03:18.997
You know, Lilith                
just holds it all in,           

03:19.065 --> 03:20.733
she has to unload it            
somewhere,                      

03:20.800 --> 03:22.701
and guess who gets              
to listen to it endlessly.      

03:22.836 --> 03:25.137
                  Apparently me,
                      Dr. Crane.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.574
     Oh, that's wonderful.      

03:28.641 --> 03:29.808
         Oh, thank you.         

03:29.876 --> 03:32.911
        Oh, yes, thanks.        

03:33.013 --> 03:34.279
                     Guess what.

03:34.347 --> 03:35.781
            I just won          
          this radio contest.   

03:35.849 --> 03:37.850
        I get a weekend trip    
     for two to Atlantic City,  

03:37.917 --> 03:39.351
          all expenses paid.    

03:39.419 --> 03:40.552
Oh, congratulations.            

03:40.620 --> 03:41.887
Who are you going to take?      

03:41.955 --> 03:43.188
            Uh, I don't know.   

03:43.256 --> 03:45.858
          I just moved to Boston
        and I don't know a soul.

03:47.427 --> 03:49.561
Yeah, yeah, I heard, I heard.   

03:52.298 --> 03:54.099
     Oh, thanks very much.      

03:54.167 --> 03:55.100
    That's incredible.          

03:55.168 --> 03:56.101
     I can't believe that.      

03:56.169 --> 03:57.102
     Hey, guys, guess what.     

03:57.203 --> 03:58.704
I just won                      
a radio contest.                

03:58.805 --> 04:01.006
You're kidding.                 

04:01.074 --> 04:02.441
I did, too.                     
                    Really?     

04:02.509 --> 04:05.544
  Yeah, you know, Atlantic City,
     free trip, the whole works.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.781
That's the same here.           

04:08.848 --> 04:09.815
                    Really?     

04:09.883 --> 04:11.283
Isn't that incredible?          

04:11.351 --> 04:13.952
          Well, it, it could be.

04:14.020 --> 04:16.055
Only problem is                 
I don't know who to take,       

04:16.122 --> 04:18.891
        you know, two tickets   
                 and everything.

04:18.958 --> 04:20.559
      I wonder what I should do.

04:20.627 --> 04:23.195
     About what?                

04:23.263 --> 04:26.198
        You have kind of a short
      attention span, don't you?

04:26.266 --> 04:28.767
              Well, I like that,
                    I like that.

04:28.835 --> 04:31.537
         (mumbling indistinctly)

04:31.604 --> 04:34.106
             We're talking about
        my two tickets and...   

04:34.207 --> 04:36.575
Oh, yeah, you know,             
I've got the same problem.      

04:36.643 --> 04:38.444
             Yeah, uh, well, you
         know what we ought to--

04:38.545 --> 04:39.778
            I'm Sam, by the way.

04:39.846 --> 04:40.879
     Oh.                        

04:40.947 --> 04:41.880
  Sam, I'm Debbie.              

04:41.948 --> 04:43.248
            Hi, Debbie, uh...   

04:43.316 --> 04:44.350
                maybe we should,
                    you know,   

04:44.417 --> 04:45.851
              instead of wasting
                four tickets,   

04:45.919 --> 04:49.021
              we should just use
          yours and go together.

04:49.089 --> 04:51.223
That's a super idea.            

04:51.291 --> 04:52.825
                Yeah, all right.

04:52.892 --> 04:55.260
        Hey, guys,              
I'm off to Atlantic City.       

04:55.328 --> 04:57.596
  Boy, those Japanese that say  
    we've lost our ingenuity    

04:57.664 --> 04:59.231
        and the ability         
      to get the job done       

04:59.299 --> 05:02.568
    ought to come to Cheers     
and have a gander at Sam Malone.

05:04.671 --> 05:05.971
                          Sammy.
             Yeah.              

05:06.039 --> 05:07.606
      I'd like you to take this,
         uh, Cliff nostril money

05:07.674 --> 05:09.908
          and put it on black 17
          at the roulette table.

05:09.976 --> 05:12.277
Black 17--                      
you got it, pal.                

05:12.345 --> 05:13.479
    Okay, we're ready.          

05:13.546 --> 05:15.414
But, now, what are we going     
to do with your tickets?        

05:15.482 --> 05:16.682
            Oh, I'll probably   
                    just, uh,   

05:16.750 --> 05:18.217
            give them away to   
                 some strangers.

05:18.284 --> 05:19.451
Oh, I'd do that, too,           

05:19.519 --> 05:21.954
but I don't know                
any strangers.                  

05:22.022 --> 05:24.156
      This is going to be       
        a great weekend.        

05:25.258 --> 05:28.093
    Uh, how come, uh,           
        black 17, Norm?         

05:28.161 --> 05:29.528
                Oh, uh, well, 17
                  is 'cause, uh,

05:29.596 --> 05:31.130
                 Vera and I were
            married on the 17th.

05:31.197 --> 05:32.564
              Oh.               

05:32.632 --> 05:37.202
And black is because Vera and   
     I were married on the 17th.

05:37.303 --> 05:38.837
                    Another one,
                      Dr. Crane?

05:38.905 --> 05:40.673
Um, no thanks, Woody.           

05:40.740 --> 05:41.907
Uh, one ought to do it.         

05:41.975 --> 05:42.975
(door opens)                    

05:44.110 --> 05:46.345
Mother and I have arrived,      
            Frasier.            

05:46.413 --> 05:50.015
Hit me, Woody, need some juice. 

05:50.083 --> 05:53.585
Thanks for helping me           
with my bags, Frasier,          

05:53.653 --> 05:57.523
but I see you've got that big,  
heavy drink to lug around.      

05:57.590 --> 05:59.591
    Hello, Betty.               

06:01.695 --> 06:04.863
So this is where you spend      
all of your time,               

06:04.964 --> 06:07.132
while my grandson               
crawls around                   

06:07.200 --> 06:10.703
in open stairwells              
and electrical outlets.         

06:11.838 --> 06:14.039
Well, actually,                 
Frederick is walking now.       

06:14.140 --> 06:16.742
If my daughter had any sense,   
so would she.                   

06:16.810 --> 06:18.177
             Is there a bathroom
                    around here?

06:18.244 --> 06:21.413
          Oh, yes, Mother, right
        down that hallway there.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.456
                 Frasier, I have
                to thank you.   

06:30.523 --> 06:32.291
        You seem to be trying   
            harder than usual   

06:32.359 --> 06:34.026
                  to be pleasant
                to my mother.   

06:34.094 --> 06:36.762
            Want to tell me what
        the hell is going on?   

06:36.830 --> 06:38.197
Well, darling,                  
for the past few months,        

06:38.264 --> 06:39.665
I've been agonizing             
over what to give you           

06:39.733 --> 06:41.233
for our fifth                   
wedding anniversary,            

06:41.301 --> 06:46.205
        and, uh, I thought about
         jewelry, a trip, a car.

06:46.272 --> 06:50.409
                But this... this
              cost me even more.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.917
    "I promise not to fight     
 with Betty during her visit."  

06:58.985 --> 07:01.487
     Happy anniversary, my love.

07:02.589 --> 07:05.257
It's very thoughtful,           
Frasier.                        

07:05.325 --> 07:07.126
Exactly how do you intend       
to pull that off?               

07:07.193 --> 07:08.927
         Well, I've been working
    at this for some time now   

07:08.995 --> 07:11.997
        and whatever Betty says,

07:12.065 --> 07:15.100
                I shall let this
        smile be my umbrella.   

07:20.373 --> 07:23.809
Well, get ready                 
to smile.                       

07:23.877 --> 07:26.011
My mother has never             
gotten over being upset         

07:26.079 --> 07:27.312
about missing                   
our wedding.                    

07:27.380 --> 07:30.983
She wants us to renew           
our wedding vows on Saturday.   

07:31.051 --> 07:33.752
              But, darling, I...

07:33.820 --> 07:37.122
            I think the whole   
                 idea is just...

07:37.190 --> 07:38.791
                 wonderful.     

07:38.858 --> 07:40.125
                    (door opens)

07:40.193 --> 07:42.561
      Hey, waitress, you want to
    turn up the heat in here?   

07:42.629 --> 07:44.663
                      I am not a
                     fish stick.

07:44.731 --> 07:48.467
Or maybe I should ask someone   
who can reach the thermostat.   

07:48.568 --> 07:51.303
                 Hey, hey.      

07:51.371 --> 07:54.840
      Lady, you can't just waltz
         in here, insult people,

07:54.908 --> 07:56.675
              and start ordering
                everyone around.

07:56.743 --> 07:57.943
Why not?                        

07:58.011 --> 07:59.945
                'Cause that's   
                         my job.

08:00.013 --> 08:04.116
I would have thought your job   
was to live under a bridge.     

08:06.186 --> 08:07.686
             Yeah?              

08:07.754 --> 08:09.755
     Well, unless you want      
        some bridgework,        

08:09.823 --> 08:11.757
    you just better shut up!    

08:12.759 --> 08:14.059
                        Look,   

08:14.127 --> 08:15.894
     she rattled me, okay?      

08:17.897 --> 08:19.665
                Betty, I-I think
             it's terribly sweet

08:19.733 --> 08:22.067
     that you want us to reenact
             our wedding, but...

08:22.135 --> 08:24.970
have you given any thought      
to a... a little cocktail party?

08:25.038 --> 08:26.905
        I-I think               
  that might be more pleasant   

08:26.973 --> 08:28.540
and perhaps a bit more intimate.

08:28.608 --> 08:30.009
             Well, you're wrong.

08:30.143 --> 08:31.744
                     Very wrong.

08:31.811 --> 08:33.312
                    You couldn't
                be more wrong   

08:33.380 --> 08:35.313
            if your fanny was   
        screwed on backwards.   

08:36.416 --> 08:38.384
                That wrong, huh?

08:46.593 --> 08:48.794
             Thanks for dropping
                 me off, Debbie.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.029
                        NORM:   
                     Hey, Sammy,

08:50.096 --> 08:52.331
         how'd it go in Atlantic
            City? You get lucky?

08:52.399 --> 08:54.700
Yeah, you bet I did.            

08:54.768 --> 08:56.435
So, uh, how much                
you win?                        

08:56.503 --> 08:58.103
                Not a cent.     

09:00.774 --> 09:02.241
                I'll call you   
            tomorrow, all right?

09:02.308 --> 09:03.542
    Okay.                       
                    Thanks.     

09:03.610 --> 09:05.411
Okay, bye.                      
                            Bye.

09:05.478 --> 09:07.446
                Sammy? Huh? Huh?

09:07.514 --> 09:09.148
  CLIFF & NORM (high-pitched):  
        Huh? Huh?               

09:09.215 --> 09:11.884
                So, you remember
                to put that, uh,

09:11.951 --> 09:14.053
                50 bucks down on
        that black 17, buddy?   

09:14.120 --> 09:16.021
Yeah, you know,                 
about that Norm...              
                        Yeah?   

09:16.089 --> 09:17.890
...you know,                    
the strangest thing happened.   

09:17.991 --> 09:19.158
I put all your money...         
                          Right.

09:19.225 --> 09:20.392
...on black 17.                 

09:20.460 --> 09:21.560
                And lost, right?

09:21.628 --> 09:23.062
No, no, no,                     
it hit, it hit.                 

09:23.129 --> 09:24.229
                        It hit?!
                      All right!

09:24.297 --> 09:25.898
But Debbie got so excited,      

09:25.965 --> 09:27.900
she started jumping             
up and down and...              

09:27.967 --> 09:30.269
and by the time,                
she was finished, I, uh...      

09:30.337 --> 09:33.772
I, uh, had accidentally         
let your winnings ride.         

09:33.873 --> 09:35.140
            I could kill you!   
                You did that?   

09:35.275 --> 09:36.909
And it hit again.               

09:37.010 --> 09:38.844
                  Whoa! What are
            the odds on that?   

09:38.978 --> 09:40.245
    Pretty damned               
    steep, buddy.               

09:40.313 --> 09:41.780
        (laughs)                
                         I don't
                     believe it!

09:41.848 --> 09:43.215
     (overlapping shouting)     

09:43.283 --> 09:44.616
            All right! Sammy!   

09:44.784 --> 09:46.085
                I'm rich!       

09:46.152 --> 09:47.286
                    I'm rich!   

09:47.354 --> 09:48.854
                Look at this.   
(whooping)                      

09:48.922 --> 09:50.055
                      All right!

09:50.123 --> 09:51.390
Sam, Sam, Sam?                  
                     What, what,
                  what, what...?

09:51.458 --> 09:52.891
Now that Norm's come            
into all this money,            

09:52.959 --> 09:54.593
don't you think it's time       
that somebody reminds him       

09:54.661 --> 09:56.095
that he has a pretty            
hefty bar tab?                  

09:56.196 --> 09:57.429
                 Oh, sweetheart,
                 he's my friend.

09:57.497 --> 09:59.031
        I can't mention that.   
             He'll come through.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.933
I don't know, Sam.              
                 Hey, hey, trust
                me, trust me.   

10:01.001 --> 10:02.468
              I've known the guy
                for a long time.

10:02.535 --> 10:03.669
                    He'll do the
                    right thing.

10:03.737 --> 10:05.437
            Sammy, this calls   
              for a celebration.

10:05.505 --> 10:07.940
                    Let's have a
              round on me, okay?

10:08.041 --> 10:10.109
        (crowd chatter)         
                        NORM:   
        Drinks for everybody!   

10:10.176 --> 10:12.077
                Sammy, put it on
                 my tab, please.

10:15.148 --> 10:16.749
        Sam? Sam?               

10:20.220 --> 10:22.521
Now, about the cake--           
do you like butter cream?       

10:22.589 --> 10:23.956
                    Yes, Mother.

10:24.024 --> 10:26.025
Good, because                   
that's what I ordered.          

10:26.092 --> 10:27.626
Now, how                        
about flowers?                  

10:27.694 --> 10:29.261
         I like roses.          

10:29.329 --> 10:31.296
Do you like                     
cascading lilies?               

10:31.398 --> 10:32.531
            Sort of.            

10:32.599 --> 10:35.634
Good! Because                   
that's what I ordered.          

10:35.702 --> 10:37.636
Now...                          

10:37.737 --> 10:40.272
why don't you go                
and learn your vows?            

10:40.340 --> 10:43.308
I've written them out.          

10:43.376 --> 10:45.811
And I'm going                   
to go call the caterer.         

10:45.879 --> 10:47.980
Looking at Frasier's            
friends,                        

10:48.048 --> 10:50.516
I know I'm going                
to need to order more.          

10:50.583 --> 10:52.618
    I don't know what.          

10:52.686 --> 10:55.287
        Just more.              

10:57.557 --> 10:59.658
She's written vows?             

10:59.726 --> 11:01.660
                    Yes.        

11:01.728 --> 11:03.829
             Apparently with the
                recurring phrase

11:03.897 --> 11:06.832
          "shiftless alcoholic."

11:12.072 --> 11:15.007
                Darling, for the
                 hundredth time,

11:15.075 --> 11:16.241
        why are we going through

11:16.309 --> 11:17.676
            with this ridiculous
        wedding re-enactment?   

11:17.744 --> 11:18.711
Because every time              

11:18.778 --> 11:21.380
I try to say "no,"              
it comes out "yes."             

11:21.448 --> 11:24.383
My behavior is solely           
to please my mother.            

11:24.451 --> 11:26.051
Why does she always             
try to turn me                  

11:26.119 --> 11:27.386
into something                  
I'm not?                        

11:27.454 --> 11:30.456
    Maybe, deep down,           
she always wanted a girl.       

11:33.793 --> 11:35.728
                            Hey.
Hey, rich guy,                  

11:35.795 --> 11:37.730
mind if I do a little           
reading here?                   

11:37.797 --> 11:39.064
                          Oh.   

11:39.132 --> 11:41.567
              Oh, Sammy, my tab.

11:41.634 --> 11:42.901
Tab? Oh!                        

11:42.969 --> 11:45.738
Thought it was                  
the Yellow Pages here.          

11:45.805 --> 11:47.906
                     Yeah.      

11:47.974 --> 11:49.975
    Boy, we've had that thing   
        a long time, haven't we?

11:50.043 --> 11:51.010
Sure have, buddy.               

11:51.077 --> 11:52.344
Look at that,                   
we go all the way back          

11:52.412 --> 11:53.746
to when we didn't               
even know your name.            

11:53.813 --> 11:56.081
"Skinny guy                     
at the end of the bar."         

11:56.182 --> 11:57.716
                    Yep.        

11:57.784 --> 11:58.917
                    Yep.        

11:58.985 --> 12:00.486
                     It's gotten
                    awfully big.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.121
                    Kind of a   
            disgrace, really.   

12:02.188 --> 12:04.156
That it is, Norm.               
That it is.                     

12:04.224 --> 12:05.591
                        NORM:   
                Tell you what   
                I'm gonna do.   

12:05.658 --> 12:07.059
            Since I've come into
                 all this money,

12:07.160 --> 12:08.994
            I'm gonna buy you   
                     a new book.

12:12.265 --> 12:13.832
Whenever I'm                    
in her presence,                

12:13.900 --> 12:15.834
I revert to being               
a little girl again.            

12:15.902 --> 12:17.836
                 But you're not.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.838
        You're a grown woman.   

12:19.906 --> 12:21.340
                      You have a

12:21.408 --> 12:22.408
successful career               

12:22.475 --> 12:23.909
and you're well respected       
in your field.                  

12:23.977 --> 12:25.577
Now, darling,                   
you must go over there          

12:25.645 --> 12:27.312
to your mother,                 
look her in the eye,            

12:27.380 --> 12:28.580
and, for God's sake,            
tell her                        

12:28.648 --> 12:30.582
that we're not going            
to reenact our damn wedding!    

12:30.650 --> 12:32.584
                You're right,   
                        Frasier.

12:35.155 --> 12:36.922
                Incidentally,   

12:36.990 --> 12:39.658
      why do you always refer to
    it as our "damn wedding"?   

12:41.761 --> 12:43.429
One hurdle                      
at a time, Lilith.              

12:43.530 --> 12:46.065
Now, I'll be with you           
all the time.                   

12:46.132 --> 12:47.599
I'll be your support.           

12:47.667 --> 12:48.767
Lean on me.                     

12:48.868 --> 12:50.936
    Is anyone else hot          
            in here?            

12:51.004 --> 12:52.604
         Say, waitress,         
          do you mind?          

12:52.672 --> 12:54.440
      I'm not a rotisserie      
            chicken.            

12:54.507 --> 12:56.041
Yeah? Well, you...              

12:56.109 --> 12:57.710
you look like one.              

13:00.347 --> 13:02.281
                 Sam.           
    Huh?                        

13:02.349 --> 13:04.750
      I just gotta take a couple
             of days sick leave.

13:04.818 --> 13:06.785
Mother,                         

13:06.853 --> 13:08.787
Frasier and I have spoken,      

13:08.855 --> 13:11.056
  and there's something I have  
 to tell you about my wedding.  

13:11.124 --> 13:12.458
        Oh, I just can't wait   

13:12.625 --> 13:14.727
                to see my little
                girl married.   

13:14.794 --> 13:18.230
          I am so sorry I missed
              it the first time!

13:18.298 --> 13:20.065
      I can't wait either,      
             Mommy.             

13:21.601 --> 13:22.668
          Come along.           

13:22.736 --> 13:23.902
     We've got a lot to do.     

13:23.970 --> 13:25.471
                I'll be right   
                there, Mommy.   

13:25.538 --> 13:28.774
    A lot of help you were,     
     you spineless bastard.     

13:40.286 --> 13:42.021
      All that money, huh?      
        Yeah.                   

13:42.088 --> 13:43.722
    Sure will come in handy.    
      Yeah.                     

13:43.823 --> 13:45.424
              You could probably
                pay off all your

13:45.525 --> 13:46.859
    outstanding debts, huh?     

13:47.027 --> 13:48.961
If I had any, Sam.              

13:49.029 --> 13:50.963
         Not me.                

13:51.031 --> 13:53.465
Own my own house,               
own my own car,                 

13:53.533 --> 13:56.402
no plastic,                     
do not believe in debt.         

13:57.737 --> 14:00.039
        So I'm beginning        
          to find out.          

14:02.642 --> 14:04.176
         Rebecca Howe?          

14:04.277 --> 14:06.245
            Why yes.            

14:06.312 --> 14:08.313
And who are you, stranger?      

14:08.381 --> 14:09.415
You wouldn't                    
remember me.                    

14:09.482 --> 14:11.050
I was a customer here           
many years ago.                 

14:11.117 --> 14:13.318
I had a couple of beers         
and couldn't pay for them       

14:13.386 --> 14:15.621
and this bar was kind           
enough to run me a tab.         

14:15.689 --> 14:16.855
        Two beers?              

14:16.923 --> 14:18.290
 And you did not pay for them?  

14:21.061 --> 14:22.094
That's right, Miss.             

14:22.162 --> 14:23.262
And I'll tell you why.          

14:23.329 --> 14:25.764
Shortly after that,             
I committed a crime of passion  

14:25.832 --> 14:28.233
and was sent to Devil's         
Island for life.                

14:28.335 --> 14:30.202
         Oh, my!                

14:30.303 --> 14:32.171
Go on, stranger.                

14:33.873 --> 14:35.741
For years, rotting              
in those cells,                 

14:35.842 --> 14:37.576
I was kept alive                
by but one thought,             

14:37.677 --> 14:39.878
the knowledge that              
I owed a debt to Cheers.        

14:39.946 --> 14:42.281
So under the light              
of a tropic moon, I escaped     

14:42.349 --> 14:43.949
and fashioned                   
a crude raft                    

14:44.017 --> 14:45.617
with vines                      
and coconut husks.              

14:45.685 --> 14:46.952
The rest is                     
unimportant.                    

14:47.020 --> 14:49.755
Suffice it to say,              
here's three dollars.           

14:49.856 --> 14:51.724
God bless you,                  
stranger.                       

14:54.027 --> 14:55.894
    Norm, did you hear that?    

14:55.962 --> 14:57.296
     How could anyone help      
         but hear that?         

14:57.464 --> 14:58.731
Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.       

14:58.798 --> 14:59.898
    Could you keep it down?     

14:59.966 --> 15:01.667
  I'm trying to watch some TV   
        over here!              

15:01.735 --> 15:03.469
How could you                   
even think                      

15:03.536 --> 15:04.803
that someone would              
be stupid enough                

15:04.871 --> 15:06.071
to take a hint                  
like that?                      

15:06.139 --> 15:07.639
                      Miss Howe,

15:07.707 --> 15:09.274
here's that dollar I borrowed   
            for lunch yesterday.

15:09.342 --> 15:11.276
              You know you could
                 have come right
                 out and told me

15:11.344 --> 15:13.112
      instead of having that guy
        come all the way here   

15:13.179 --> 15:14.446
            from Devil's Island.

15:18.685 --> 15:21.286
 Sam, let me have a quick one,  
        will you?               

15:21.354 --> 15:22.755
I'm showing Betty               
the sights.                     

15:22.822 --> 15:23.789
                    Oh, yeah?   

15:23.857 --> 15:24.823
                Where is she?   

15:24.891 --> 15:26.291
Well, I gave her                
a little shove                  

15:26.359 --> 15:28.293
into Filene's Basement          
and yelled "Sale!"              

15:28.361 --> 15:32.131
With any luck, she'll           
be trampled to death.           

15:32.232 --> 15:33.932
             Your wife's waiting
            for you up there.   

15:34.067 --> 15:35.134
Oh.                             

15:35.201 --> 15:38.203
Oh, hello, dear.                

15:39.339 --> 15:40.939
                  You caught me.

15:41.007 --> 15:42.107
        I'm hiding.             

15:42.175 --> 15:43.876
          Yeah, well, this is as
            good a place as any.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.878
     This is where I always come
    to hide from my problems.   

15:45.945 --> 15:47.880
              I mean, my-my work
            problems, of course.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.816
        You know, my-my domestic
        life is just, well...   

15:52.185 --> 15:53.952
Things are looking up, Frasier. 

15:54.020 --> 15:55.621
     I've been researching      
          the problem           

15:55.689 --> 15:57.556
         of how to deal         
  with an overbearing mother.   

15:57.624 --> 15:59.158
  I think you'll be delighted   
            to learn            

15:59.225 --> 16:01.960
 that I've hit upon the perfect 
    course of action.           

16:02.028 --> 16:03.562
Oh, darling, how exciting!      

16:03.630 --> 16:05.130
        A breakthrough!         
        What's the plan?        

16:05.198 --> 16:06.799
     To acquiesce totally.      

16:06.866 --> 16:09.902
Yes, I'm going to let my mother 
     run roughshod over me.     

16:09.969 --> 16:11.637
It's time                       
to cut our losses.              

16:11.705 --> 16:14.239
        I'm at the third        
  from final turn in the maze   

16:14.307 --> 16:15.674
     and unbeknownst to me,     

16:15.742 --> 16:19.478
    the researcher has          
      removed the cheese.       

16:19.546 --> 16:22.715
     Your analogies always      
      bring it home, dear.      

16:28.054 --> 16:31.457
Yeah, still can't get your      
mother off your back, huh?      

16:31.524 --> 16:34.360
It's very difficult for me      
         to relate to.          

16:34.427 --> 16:35.728
            Really?             

16:35.829 --> 16:38.030
 Oh, yeah. Ma and I don't have  
         any problems.          

16:38.098 --> 16:40.032
 You know, in fact, most people 

16:40.100 --> 16:42.601
     find it's hard to tell     
    that we're even related.    

16:42.669 --> 16:44.903
     Folks down at Club Med     
    are very surprised          

16:44.971 --> 16:46.538
    when they find out          
     we're mother and son.      

16:48.241 --> 16:49.575
Shocked even.                   

16:53.780 --> 16:55.581
You know, Dr. Sternin-Crane,    
I always heard                  

16:55.648 --> 16:58.150
that you should tell your       
mother exactly how you feel.    

16:58.218 --> 16:59.385
  Is that what you do, Woody?   

16:59.486 --> 17:02.187
          Yeah, right,          
    like I want a whopping.     

17:03.790 --> 17:05.790
        Well, thank you         
    very much, Woody.           

17:05.858 --> 17:06.825
    I appreciate that.          

17:06.893 --> 17:08.694
 You know, I have another idea. 

17:08.762 --> 17:10.762
  Thank you very much, Woody.   
    I appreciate that.          

17:10.829 --> 17:13.098
    You didn't let me           
     tell you the idea yet.     

17:13.199 --> 17:16.135
Woody, in certain company,      
    when someone says,          

17:16.202 --> 17:18.203
     "Thank you very much.      
      I appreciate that."       

17:18.271 --> 17:20.772
 It means, "I don't thank you.  
    I don't appreciate that.    

17:20.839 --> 17:22.540
         And I want you         
      to shut your mouth."      

17:23.676 --> 17:24.977
    Oh, thank you very much,    

17:25.045 --> 17:26.310
    Dr. Sternin-Crane.          
    I appreciate that.          

17:33.887 --> 17:35.854
        (doorbell rings)        

17:38.725 --> 17:41.026
            So glad you could   
                      come, Sam.
Oh, thank you.                  

17:41.094 --> 17:43.629
                The gift table's
                     over there.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.864
          We were, uh,          
    supposed to bring gifts?    

17:45.932 --> 17:47.800
         Don't give it          
      a second thought...       

17:47.901 --> 17:49.768
        Mr. Trump.              

17:53.073 --> 17:54.239
Hey, man, I'm so sorry.         

17:54.307 --> 17:55.974
    I didn't realize we were    
    supposed to bring gifts.    

17:56.042 --> 17:57.309
Oh, that's all right, Sam.      

17:57.377 --> 17:59.044
    Your presence here          
      is more than enough.      

17:59.112 --> 18:02.214
        Paul, you scamp,        
    is this a toaster oven?     

18:05.218 --> 18:06.852
          So you see,           
        that's why Shamu        

18:06.920 --> 18:08.954
  cannot really be considered   
        a killer whale.         

18:11.157 --> 18:13.325
        Hello, I'm Dr. Bramwell,

18:13.393 --> 18:15.361
                     a colleague
                of Frasier's.   

18:15.428 --> 18:17.629
  I couldn't help overhearing   
    your conversation.          

18:17.697 --> 18:19.631
You must be one of his patients.

18:19.733 --> 18:22.001
        No, no...               

18:22.068 --> 18:23.936
    I'm one of his friends,     
    uh, Cliff Clavin.           

18:24.004 --> 18:27.306
Oh, well, then I wouldn't       
      be poaching if I...       

18:27.374 --> 18:30.476
  Well, uh... here's my card.   

18:31.444 --> 18:32.745
              Huh.              

18:32.812 --> 18:33.712
         Uh, thank you.         

18:33.813 --> 18:35.314
      Thank you very much.      

18:35.382 --> 18:37.182
      That's the third one      
         I got tonight.         

18:37.250 --> 18:38.851
    I must have a sign          
    on my back or something.    

18:41.154 --> 18:42.755
              Sam, there's Norm.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.289
                This might be   
                a good chance   
No, no.                         

18:44.357 --> 18:45.657
                to ask him about
                    the bar tab.
Come on...                      

18:45.725 --> 18:47.826
                  You can do it.
This is not--                   
he'll get upset.                

18:47.894 --> 18:49.361
         No, he won't get upset.
          This is the last place

18:49.429 --> 18:50.729
                    in the world
              he'd make a scene.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.498
         Just be discreet. Norm.

18:52.565 --> 18:55.034
          Norm, Sam wants to ask
         you about your bar tab.
  Oh.                           

18:55.101 --> 18:57.369
    (laughs)                    

18:57.470 --> 18:59.171
         I, it's just, you know,
        she thinks, you know,   

18:59.239 --> 19:01.306
    you came into some money,   
 that maybe it'd be appropriate,

19:01.374 --> 19:02.908
            you know, to pay off
        some of your bar tab.   

19:02.976 --> 19:05.144
      Well, sure, if I had      
        any money left.         

19:05.211 --> 19:07.780
        Wait a minute, you spent
            all-- every cent?   

19:07.847 --> 19:09.281
             Yeah.              

19:09.349 --> 19:11.650
    What the heck, you know,    
easy come, easy go, Sammy.      

19:11.718 --> 19:13.686
It was found money, I figured,  

19:13.753 --> 19:16.622
  so why not do something that  
 I always wanted to do with it. 

19:16.690 --> 19:19.024
        So, I went down,        

19:19.092 --> 19:21.193
      and I bought a boat.      

19:21.294 --> 19:22.795
Isn't it a beauty?              

19:22.862 --> 19:24.129
      I can't believe that, man.

19:24.197 --> 19:25.631
      What?                     
                You spent it?   

19:25.699 --> 19:27.866
             Hah...             
        After all those years   
              of me carrying you

19:27.934 --> 19:29.368
                  while you were
                    unemployed?!

19:29.469 --> 19:31.303
Well... yeah, but...            
            You're my friend?   

19:31.371 --> 19:34.540
 I-I listen to all your stupid  
little comments every day?      

19:34.607 --> 19:37.810
 I-I let you run up the largest 
      bar tab in history,       

19:37.877 --> 19:39.311
            and then you come   
                 into some money

19:39.379 --> 19:41.046
                 and you tell me
          you don't pay me back?

19:41.114 --> 19:42.681
                You-you spend it
              on a stupid boat?!

19:42.749 --> 19:45.050
            Well, I hope you and
        the stupid boat sink!   

19:45.118 --> 19:47.152
            You big deadbeat!   

19:49.456 --> 19:51.890
Sammy, I, I bought              
the boat for you.               

19:51.958 --> 19:55.427
See, it's, it's                 
the <i>Mayday Malone,</i> see?         

19:55.528 --> 19:58.130
              I mean, thank you.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.701
You know, I know how bad        
you felt when your boat sank    

20:02.769 --> 20:05.537
and, well, it's something       
I always wanted to do, big guy. 

20:05.605 --> 20:07.706
                        Oh, man.
         That's the nicest thing

20:07.774 --> 20:09.108
      anyone's ever done for me.

20:09.209 --> 20:11.276
         Yeah.                  
              Hey, listen, about
                 that bar tab...

20:11.344 --> 20:12.878
    Yeah, I know...             
             I've broken it down

20:12.946 --> 20:14.880
          into 36 easy payments.

20:16.383 --> 20:18.851
Now I want you                  
to stand up straight            

20:18.918 --> 20:20.119
when you're out there.          

20:20.186 --> 20:21.587
All eyes will be on you.        

20:21.654 --> 20:22.688
          Yes, Mommy.           

20:22.756 --> 20:24.056
And for heaven's sake, speak up.

20:24.124 --> 20:26.158
         I want to hear         
      every word clearly.       

20:26.226 --> 20:27.092
        (louder):               
          Yes, Mommy.           

20:27.160 --> 20:28.360
Not now, when you're out there. 

20:30.563 --> 20:32.498
        (knocking)              

20:33.700 --> 20:35.300
             May I see the bride
            before the ceremony?

20:35.368 --> 20:36.368
        Oh, no, Frasier.        

20:36.436 --> 20:37.703
        I don't want you        
      to see me like this.      

20:37.771 --> 20:39.204
             Oh, nonsense, dear.

20:42.976 --> 20:44.376
                    Oh, my Lord.

20:44.444 --> 20:47.513
              Is this my Lilith,
             so... so beautiful?

20:47.580 --> 20:49.415
          "Beautiful"?          

20:49.482 --> 20:50.816
                  And your hair.

20:51.017 --> 20:53.385
            It's so gorgeous.   

20:53.453 --> 20:56.155
     My face is beautiful?      
      My hair is gorgeous?      

20:56.222 --> 20:58.524
  What's next, I have a cute,   
        little caboose?         

21:00.293 --> 21:01.660
Watch your mouth, Lilith.       

21:01.828 --> 21:04.263
    You know how much           
          I hate this.          

21:04.330 --> 21:06.598
      I wouldn't have put       
  this horrid paint on my face  

21:06.666 --> 21:08.500
 or worn this atrocious hairdo  
          if my mother          

21:08.568 --> 21:11.270
      weren't emotionally       
 blackmailing me into doing so. 

21:11.338 --> 21:12.705
"Blackmailing" you?             

21:12.772 --> 21:14.707
        How could you?!         
                Shut up, Mother!

21:14.774 --> 21:16.575
  It's bad enough I have to be  
    your little girl,           

21:16.643 --> 21:18.811
  I don't have to be his, too.  
  Now, for once in your life,   

21:18.878 --> 21:20.846
      keep your mouth shut      
         and butt out!          

21:20.914 --> 21:23.048
            (crying)            

21:24.684 --> 21:25.918
              I'm sorry, Mother.

21:25.985 --> 21:27.219
Oh, no.                         

21:27.287 --> 21:29.355
It's so beautiful!              

21:29.422 --> 21:33.192
I said the same thing           
to my mother on my wedding day. 

21:35.061 --> 21:36.395
The tears,                      

21:36.463 --> 21:38.464
    the unhappiness...          

21:38.531 --> 21:40.799
        I wouldn't have         
missed this for the world.      

21:40.867 --> 21:43.602
        (knocking)              

21:43.670 --> 21:45.904
             Uh, Fras, you going
              to be much longer?

21:45.972 --> 21:47.773
            'Cause I hit that   
        punch bowl kind of hard.

21:54.748 --> 21:56.415
             Are you going to be
              all right, Mother?

21:56.483 --> 21:58.217
Yes, I'm fine.                  

21:58.284 --> 22:01.420
I want to be ready when         
they ask if anybody objects.    

22:02.889 --> 22:04.890
    I've written it all out.    

22:06.226 --> 22:07.826
    We love you, too, Betty.    

22:13.566 --> 22:16.001
      Frasier, I apologize      
      for yelling at you.       

22:16.069 --> 22:17.836
Now be honest.                  

22:17.904 --> 22:20.439
Didn't you say that I was       
     beautiful and gorgeous     

22:20.507 --> 22:22.207
only to force a catharsis?      

22:23.343 --> 22:25.144
    Guilty as charged.          

22:25.211 --> 22:27.279
        Then help me get        
     this junk off my face.     

22:27.347 --> 22:29.081
    ("Wedding March" begins)    

22:29.149 --> 22:30.349
                 Oh, darling.   

22:30.417 --> 22:31.950
        We don't seem to have   
        time for that right now.

22:32.018 --> 22:34.720
     As much as I hate it,      
you'll have to keep it on.      

22:34.788 --> 22:36.188
        Oh.                     
                     Now listen,
              let's go out there

22:36.256 --> 22:37.723
            and say our "I do's"
              and then I'll haul

22:37.791 --> 22:39.391
    your cute, little caboose
