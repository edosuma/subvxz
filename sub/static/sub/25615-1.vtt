00:51.600 --> 00:53.130
That's the city

00:53.130 --> 00:56.360
A very ancient site round three hot springs

01:00.330 --> 01:02.360
It's well known that the Georgian architects

01:02.360 --> 01:04.900
used occult principle to lay out the city

01:05.800 --> 01:09.700
It's diameter deliberately matches that of Stonehenge

01:15.930 --> 01:19.630
We discovered there's a hidden level under the streets

01:20.960 --> 01:23.900
a secret from the past that they deliberately kept hidden

01:23.930 --> 01:27.530
It has an occult significance

01:29.330 --> 01:31.500
We will infect you

01:31.500 --> 01:31.860
Half beast half man
We will infect you

01:31.860 --> 01:33.860
Half beast half man

01:45.260 --> 01:48.160
Hi... I'm Andy... film student...

01:48.160 --> 01:52.500
And this is footage I'm putting together of my Landlord's business –

01:52.500 --> 01:54.500
Occult Angel.

01:56.200 --> 02:00.660
Cool, This is Jack's house. I rent a room here...

02:01.860 --> 02:05.930
he's rented it to students ever since his wife left him

02:05.930 --> 02:06.000
Yeah well It started to change about a month ago...
he's rented it to students ever since his wife left him

02:06.000 --> 02:09.660
Yeah well It started to change about a month ago...

02:10.199 --> 02:12.400
I just started getting more calls

02:12.400 --> 02:12.430
OK... So last week when I went to a case with Jack
I just started getting more calls

02:12.430 --> 02:15.530
OK... So last week when I went to a case with Jack

02:15.530 --> 02:15.630
but then... well this...
OK... So last week when I went to a case with Jack

02:15.630 --> 02:19.300
but then... well this...

02:26.360 --> 02:29.030
So here I've had to disguise Mrs B.

02:29.030 --> 02:31.030
That's what Jack wanted...

02:31.030 --> 02:33.160
So this is what happened when we got inside.

02:35.660 --> 02:37.960
Then sometimes a kind of cry.

02:37.960 --> 02:38.000
Like a baby or something
then sometimes a kind of cry.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Like a baby or something

02:40.030 --> 02:42.730
Jack does this weird listening

02:51.600 --> 02:53.860
no, no...

02:53.930 --> 02:55.860
yeah, this feels more interesting

02:55.860 --> 03:01.260
This is an older part of the house here... thicker walls

03:04.560 --> 03:07.600
and the floor levels been raised...

03:17.660 --> 03:21.530
This is weird... I don't like this.

03:26.430 --> 03:29.530
That noise... is getting louder.

04:00.730 --> 04:02.400
Turn it off!

04:06.160 --> 04:09.730
It looks like a big chunk of plaster fell off.

04:13.700 --> 04:17.959
And there's markings on it.

04:24.800 --> 04:28.400
Something got hold of me

04:28.400 --> 04:33.130
All I could see in my minds eye was the serpent

04:33.130 --> 04:35.130
So this is a fetish.

04:35.130 --> 04:40.230
And you can see this is the outline of the horned serpent

04:40.230 --> 04:42.730
It's very unusual about the horned serpent

04:42.730 --> 04:42.760
Not really sure what this symbol is or what it means
It's very unusual about the horned serpent

04:42.760 --> 04:46.000
Not really sure what this symbol is or what it means

04:46.000 --> 04:50.330
and this looks like hair

04:50.330 --> 04:50.400
and this could possibly be skin tissue
and this looks like hair

04:50.400 --> 04:54.760
and this could possibly be skin tissue

05:08.330 --> 05:09.960
Lady who?

05:12.830 --> 05:17.160
She says something killed her dog...

05:43.160 --> 05:45.600
So, this is Lady O's

05:45.600 --> 05:45.630
She was... well, a bit whoozy
So, this is Lady O's

05:45.630 --> 05:48.830
She was... well, a bit whoozy

05:49.360 --> 05:53.460
Sorry. She has to touch things to help tune in.

05:53.860 --> 05:57.360
That is Lola, she Jack's niece

05:57.360 --> 05:59.460
and she's here to help Jack out

06:08.160 --> 06:09.360
Ready?

06:44.130 --> 06:46.800
This is definitely and older part of the cellar

06:46.800 --> 06:49.060
older than the house above.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.060
Something.

07:09.560 --> 07:12.000
Hang on, I'm putting the night vision on

07:19.400 --> 07:21.800
So what's happening?

07:21.800 --> 07:26.630
This has been here for a long time.

07:26.630 --> 07:29.330
See this arch has been filled in with breeze block

07:29.330 --> 07:31.330
What do you think Lola?

07:31.330 --> 07:36.800
Well, it's what I'm here for.

07:45.630 --> 07:47.400
What's going on?

07:48.760 --> 07:49.600
Lola!

07:49.600 --> 07:51.360
Heuuurrrrrnnnnnn!

07:51.360 --> 07:51.600
Get out!
Heuuurrrrrnnnnnn!

07:51.600 --> 07:52.530
Get out!

07:52.530 --> 07:55.130
Lola! LOLA!

07:57.300 --> 07:58.800
What was it?

07:59.860 --> 08:01.430
No, no...

08:01.430 --> 08:03.400
Be still! BE STILL!

08:08.430 --> 08:11.200
It stank of meat.

08:30.730 --> 08:35.960
We're in the workroom having a debrief... and Jack is worried.

08:35.960 --> 08:38.929
Yeah good reason 'cos this is definitely getting worse.

08:38.929 --> 08:41.630
It had a real... strength!

08:41.630 --> 08:43.630
Explain what that means.

08:45.200 --> 08:48.860
I... I couldn't stop it... It was using the doorway...

08:48.860 --> 08:50.530
What?

08:50.530 --> 08:54.130
But it's getting worse... and it's got something to do with this symbol.

08:58.630 --> 09:02.960
So we checked out all the different symbols using snakes or serpents.

09:02.960 --> 09:08.330
Yes well snakes serpents and dragons all get mixed up

09:08.330 --> 09:11.200
and they can signify all sorts of things.

09:11.200 --> 09:12.960
And Jack found this...

09:12.960 --> 09:18.160
The horned serpent is uniquely associated with an ancient Celtic god

09:18.730 --> 09:20.360
called Cernunnos

09:20.400 --> 09:24.700
and the interesting bit is that...

09:24.700 --> 09:28.230
Cernunnos, half stag, half man

09:28.960 --> 09:33.360
is also known in Southern England as Herne.

09:33.360 --> 09:35.360
Heuuurrrrrnnnnnn!

09:35.360 --> 09:37.660
You think that was what she was saying?

09:39.300 --> 09:43.900
Something spoke through her... and it really brutal and primeval

09:48.900 --> 09:51.400
So, what's the significance?

09:51.400 --> 09:53.130
I'm not sure

09:53.130 --> 09:55.400
Yeah but you know about weirdy stuff like this.

09:57.530 --> 10:00.630
Andy I'm getting really hacked off with your attitude

10:00.630 --> 10:02.530
Why don't you just stop now

10:02.530 --> 10:04.530
Sorry Jack... I was only...

10:04.530 --> 10:06.160
Just Stop!

10:14.300 --> 10:16.830
So Jack got a bit narked with me...

10:16.830 --> 10:20.260
But he's had another call... and agreed for me to come along...

10:20.260 --> 10:22.560
I'm gonna try and keep my mouth shut.

10:22.560 --> 10:24.560
Sounds good to me.

10:29.730 --> 10:32.130
That's the pub manager

10:32.130 --> 10:35.400
We’ve agreed not to reveal his face or the name of the pub

10:36.430 --> 10:40.900
It's usually in the evenings... when I'm cashing up... I sit at the desk.

10:40.900 --> 10:42.260
Here?

10:48.130 --> 10:52.930
Then the room will suddenly get cold...
and then I feel it... usually on my back...

10:52.930 --> 10:54.930
like a hand.

10:56.230 --> 10:59.860
It's not a draught or anything like that... it's like a hand.

11:01.660 --> 11:04.130
It's not a spirit... it's something else...

11:09.260 --> 11:11.330
It's coming from there...

11:11.630 --> 11:14.900
It's locked... I... I was told not to open it... but...
I know where the key is...

11:14.900 --> 11:16.260
Could you get it for us?

11:19.960 --> 11:23.130
Hey can you feel that?

11:24.160 --> 11:26.430
Yeah... It's gone really cold.

11:30.830 --> 11:32.430
Go on...

11:38.530 --> 11:39.630
Wow...

11:39.630 --> 11:41.760
The horned serpent again.

11:42.860 --> 11:44.630
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

11:44.630 --> 11:46.630
Who are these people? Get out!

11:46.630 --> 11:48.160
Uh... I asked them

11:48.160 --> 11:50.130
We haven't done anything!

11:50.130 --> 11:51.560
And put that camera down.

11:51.560 --> 11:52.830
Hey!

11:52.830 --> 11:54.760
I told you not to open that door!

11:54.760 --> 11:56.730
What was that all about?

11:56.730 --> 11:58.700
Let's go... just go...

12:11.900 --> 12:16.100
I'm a bit skeptical about this paranormal stuff...

12:16.960 --> 12:20.930
but that bloke who burst in and told us to clear out,
he was real enough...

12:20.930 --> 12:25.260
So I went back later and talked to the pub manager

12:25.260 --> 12:28.060
and he gave us some more information

12:28.060 --> 12:31.900
turns out the guys name is Crouch and he’s the pub owner

12:38.160 --> 12:40.400
So... that's where Crouch's office is...

12:40.400 --> 12:42.000
I hung around a bit earlier...

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
as far as I could tell he just rents one room...

12:44.000 --> 12:48.030
Now I guess I just wait... stakeout!

12:48.030 --> 12:50.400
Well this is boring.

12:50.400 --> 12:52.400
That’s Crouch!

12:52.400 --> 12:55.500
Ok, so um, this is it!

13:00.930 --> 13:02.660
I bloody lost him!

13:04.260 --> 13:07.400
Ah, there he is... locked on!

13:14.730 --> 13:16.860
Hey, this is cool

13:21.800 --> 13:25.300
This is weird. Suddenly all those seagulls went crazy

13:25.300 --> 13:27.500
and started swirling about over Crouch.

13:27.500 --> 13:29.900
And he keeps looking up at them

13:34.660 --> 13:37.260
Ok, he's going into the church

13:44.460 --> 13:47.130
He's looking at the seagulls again

13:49.060 --> 13:50.930
What's he doing?

13:55.530 --> 13:57.500
He's crazy!

14:02.760 --> 14:05.130
He's gone into the library...

14:14.130 --> 14:16.160
There he is.

14:18.100 --> 14:21.060
OK... Crouch has just gone out...

14:21.060 --> 14:23.030
He's left his stuff on the desk

14:23.030 --> 14:26.360
so I'm going to have a quick look

15:00.900 --> 15:02.330
Shit, Crouch!

15:02.330 --> 15:04.660
Crouch finished at the Library...

15:04.660 --> 15:08.560
I was just thinking about giving up when he came out again...

15:09.500 --> 15:11.500
OK. This is weird...

15:11.500 --> 15:14.030
That's Lady O's house where we were the other day

15:15.260 --> 15:16.600
Oh shit.

15:18.800 --> 15:20.560
OK, I'm going to follow him

15:28.730 --> 15:31.060
I can't see a bloody thing

15:38.400 --> 15:40.400
What?

15:42.130 --> 15:45.160
What's he doing?

15:48.430 --> 15:50.230
He's looking at something

15:56.960 --> 15:58.860
This is weird...

15:58.860 --> 16:00.860
He's weird.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.430
He's going to see me...

16:09.860 --> 16:12.160
I had to get behind a car

16:16.700 --> 16:19.800
...I knew he'd be looking...

16:19.800 --> 16:21.960
And you know I've just thought of something...

16:21.960 --> 16:25.630
Lady O's house... it's number thirty-one!

16:27.830 --> 16:30.200
Think it's time I went and saw Jack.

16:30.200 --> 16:32.160
Yes I knew about John Wood...

16:32.160 --> 16:34.160
There are two of them father and son...

16:34.160 --> 16:37.530
and I knew that they had an interest in the occult...

16:42.060 --> 16:46.330
and I knew that they built the Circus and Royal Crescent

16:46.330 --> 16:48.430
on occult principles

16:50.160 --> 16:52.130
So who's the Thomas Jelly bloke?

16:52.130 --> 16:54.560
He was another builder contemporary with Wood...

16:55.530 --> 16:57.730
I don't know much about him...

16:57.730 --> 17:00.400
seems he had an interest in the occult too

17:07.130 --> 17:08.329
So what do we do now?

17:09.160 --> 17:11.859
Uh... back to Lady O.

17:12.630 --> 17:14.359
So here we are again.

17:14.359 --> 17:17.329
Oi, I can't see the number, you're in the way

17:18.800 --> 17:21.060
Lady O seemed quite keen to talk...

17:21.060 --> 17:23.960
said she knew about Thomas Jelly.

17:24.730 --> 17:27.560
So Crouch was kneeling by that stone

17:36.260 --> 17:37.900
I need to get closer

17:44.930 --> 17:48.500
A horned serpent... and the number '5'

17:49.130 --> 17:51.200
What's it mean?

18:09.030 --> 18:10.160
Ah!

18:10.160 --> 18:10.400
What?
Ah!

18:10.400 --> 18:10.860
What?

18:10.860 --> 18:12.100
The same thing!

18:12.100 --> 18:13.360
What thing?

18:13.360 --> 18:14.330
Shut up Andy

18:14.330 --> 18:15.330
What thing?

18:15.330 --> 18:16.960
Not now!

18:21.000 --> 18:24.360
Lady O's family have owned this house since

18:24.360 --> 18:26.300
since the old part was built by

18:26.300 --> 18:29.700
by none other than Thomas Jelly in 1758

18:31.860 --> 18:34.700
and so they have all the deeds and that kind of stuff

18:34.700 --> 18:37.060
most of it is just plans and accounts...

18:37.060 --> 18:40.300
but there is this letter...

18:41.130 --> 18:47.200
OK... It's not clear who the letter is to but it's signed IM ...

18:47.200 --> 18:49.460
anyway it says...

18:49.460 --> 18:52.400
Sir, following our investigation

18:52.400 --> 18:54.560
I have been able to draw certain conclusions...

18:54.560 --> 18:59.400
that there are six gates built by the monks of the abbey...

18:59.400 --> 19:03.560
two I believe were damaged severely in an earthquake

19:03.560 --> 19:07.260
that shook this city and much of England in 1275.

19:07.260 --> 19:12.230
In deed I have found some evidence of manifestations at this time.

19:12.230 --> 19:17.260
Moreover the gates seem to be holding since the works at St. Michaels

19:17.260 --> 19:21.060
We also look to your support in regards to sealing the gate

19:21.060 --> 19:23.730
below the church of St. James.

19:23.730 --> 19:30.430
Sir, I implore your pardon for these occurrences

19:30.430 --> 19:33.860
But it is only in the last year that

19:33.860 --> 19:38.200
we have to realise the nature and extremity of our dark enemy.

19:38.200 --> 19:40.700
So we were chewing over this letter

19:40.700 --> 19:43.860
wondering what it meant by six gates

19:43.860 --> 19:45.800
when Lady O said

19:45.800 --> 19:48.600
Have you looked at the plan on the other piece of paper?

19:49.430 --> 19:51.160
And this is what we found

19:51.300 --> 19:53.260
with the horned serpent again!

19:53.260 --> 19:53.300
And then Jack saw a pattern
with the horned serpent again!

19:53.300 --> 19:55.830
And then Jack saw a pattern

19:55.830 --> 20:00.900
I mean these are the six gates... but they're not city gates...

20:00.900 --> 20:04.860
one... don't know, but two would be St. Michael's chapel,

20:04.860 --> 20:08.230
three is St. Jame's church...

20:08.230 --> 20:11.330
Four is the pub... it had the four

20:11.330 --> 20:14.000
Five is here at Lady O's...

20:14.000 --> 20:19.330
and then six would be St. Michael's on Walcot Street!

20:19.330 --> 20:23.730
So what are these gates for?

20:32.460 --> 20:37.400
So we have this rough plan which schematically shows the six gates.

20:37.400 --> 20:43.100
Now the fact that there are two churches dedicated to St. Michael's

20:43.100 --> 20:47.400
interesting especially as he was famous for slaying serpents.

20:47.400 --> 20:51.930
So the two St. Michael churches are where we're heading next

20:55.530 --> 20:59.130
I love this spot... The history that is here...

20:59.130 --> 21:03.530
You have to imagine that two thousand
years ago this was a steaming swamp

21:03.530 --> 21:07.660
A sacred site for the Celts...
then the Roman's turned up and built their temple

21:07.660 --> 21:11.860
collecting the hot springs into sacred pools... or Roman Baths.

21:11.860 --> 21:13.530
There are three hot springs

21:13.530 --> 21:17.200
Up there is the main one and the site of the Roman Temple...

21:21.130 --> 21:23.530
The second one is over there

21:27.260 --> 21:30.130
See the spring is underneath this building...

21:30.130 --> 21:34.900
and right beside it... is a chapel dedicated to St. Michael.

21:37.760 --> 21:41.600
St.Michael the destroyer of serpents...

21:41.600 --> 21:44.360
perhaps pagan serpents

21:44.360 --> 21:49.260
associated with a significant heathen spring.

21:50.830 --> 21:53.700
Anyway, let's take a look inside the church

22:00.900 --> 22:03.960
So... it's a little bland in here now

22:03.960 --> 22:08.830
Obviously nothing left of the earlier chapel that stood here

22:11.000 --> 22:13.830
Lola, anything?

22:13.830 --> 22:15.830
Nothing.

22:17.730 --> 22:20.960
We carried on to the next St. Michael's

22:20.960 --> 22:23.860
So we've just come down Upper Borough walls there

22:23.860 --> 22:27.560
and now we're standing at the site of the medieval North Gate

22:27.560 --> 22:31.230
and outside would have been fields with a church

22:31.230 --> 22:34.330
and a small thatched roof.

22:34.330 --> 22:37.430
This St Michael's was a disappointment as well.

22:37.430 --> 22:40.400
The Victorians had completely rebuilt it

22:57.560 --> 23:00.200
We found nothing inside the churches...

23:00.200 --> 23:04.530
so we thought we'd have a scan round to see if we can find gate one

23:06.100 --> 23:10.160
We checked the obelisk in Queen's square. Nothing.

23:12.430 --> 23:15.760
We carried on scanning round... and then I realised

23:15.760 --> 23:19.730
Hey... wait up... This is where Crouch's office is!

23:25.960 --> 23:29.200
Now, we think Crouch's office maybe

23:29.200 --> 23:32.030
over or near Gate number one.

23:32.030 --> 23:36.360
OK, we were just wondering what to do when Crouch came out.

23:36.360 --> 23:39.130
Um, he didn't see us...

23:39.130 --> 23:43.900
But we thought maybe we should have a snoop around.

24:25.030 --> 24:28.930
So we've come down to the basement

24:28.930 --> 24:31.930
to meet Jim the security guard

26:24.200 --> 26:26.500
do you mind if Lola has a listen for a minute?

26:26.500 --> 26:28.500
Be my guest.

26:28.500 --> 26:30.630
What do you think Lola?

26:34.930 --> 26:41.260
That's where the gate is... in that room, it must be...

26:49.530 --> 26:55.360
OK... so we just got back to Jack's and we found this.

26:55.360 --> 26:57.360
What's it mean?

26:57.360 --> 27:00.460
I would say someone is trying to scare us...

27:01.760 --> 27:04.530
So who wrote the bloody message?

27:04.530 --> 27:06.530
Crouch, has to be.

27:06.530 --> 27:08.860
Or some one working with him.

27:08.860 --> 27:11.930
He may not be working alone... we don't know that.

27:11.930 --> 27:14.430
Do you think he really was threatening us?

27:14.430 --> 27:16.430
Maybe we should call the police?

27:16.430 --> 27:22.730
No... But it shows Crouch or someone knows where we are.

27:22.730 --> 27:27.230
We'd better be careful... keep an eye out.

27:33.900 --> 27:37.300
Jack has just received this message.

27:55.330 --> 28:00.200
OK... We're on our way to Crouch's office to meet Jim.

28:00.200 --> 28:05.200
Turns out that not only did Crouch lay
into Jim for letting us have a snoop round

28:05.200 --> 28:08.860
but he also went into his basement room and

28:08.860 --> 28:14.030
about half an hour later Jim heard this weird animal yell.

28:14.030 --> 28:16.100
Said it freaked him out...

28:16.100 --> 28:20.330
and then Crouch sort of stumbled out of the room and ran outside...

28:20.330 --> 28:23.500
So Jim wants some explanations.

29:20.400 --> 29:22.160
That serious?

29:22.160 --> 29:24.160
Yes... that serious.

29:30.300 --> 29:34.030
Hang on, putting the night vision on

29:37.160 --> 29:40.830
Wow! Look at this Andy

29:40.830 --> 29:43.530
This is old!

29:47.330 --> 29:48.630
Listen!

29:49.700 --> 29:52.930
Sounds like running water.

29:58.260 --> 30:01.160
Can you feel the air? ... It's warm.

30:02.060 --> 30:05.260
It smells of rotten meat.

30:05.260 --> 30:08.130
I can't smell it.

30:14.260 --> 30:16.700
Andy, look...

30:16.700 --> 30:22.200
Gate One, Conduit to Stanton Drew

30:22.200 --> 30:25.830
Compton Dando, King's Circus

30:26.530 --> 30:28.730
Draconis Extinctor...

30:28.730 --> 30:34.030
It's something do with a dragon... or serpent. Destroying the serpent.

30:35.760 --> 30:38.230
What is that?

30:39.700 --> 30:41.100
It's coming.

30:41.100 --> 30:42.630
What?

30:42.630 --> 30:44.560
It's coming!

30:50.760 --> 30:52.460
Come on we've got to go!

30:52.460 --> 30:53.860
What is that?

30:53.860 --> 30:54.730
COME ON!

30:54.730 --> 30:57.500
I just... I've got to see

31:01.130 --> 31:03.430
Come on we've got to go now!

31:03.430 --> 31:06.630
Come on move it!

31:15.230 --> 31:16.800
What was that all about?

31:16.800 --> 31:17.830
I don't know

31:17.830 --> 31:21.060
but it's really powerful,
we just got to stay away until we know how to deal with it!

31:21.060 --> 31:21.660
Wha?

31:21.660 --> 31:23.660
And don't tell Jim, OK?

31:23.660 --> 31:24.730
Why not?

31:24.730 --> 31:27.530
Just do as I tell you and turn that bloody camera off!

31:32.500 --> 31:39.300
So we're just going over stuff, starting with Gate One.

31:40.660 --> 31:43.500
Look... I know you don't experience this like we do

31:44.730 --> 31:47.830
but there was something in that tunnel that was more...

31:47.830 --> 31:49.900
threatening than anything I've ever experienced in my life

31:52.100 --> 31:53.900
You mean a spirit?

31:53.900 --> 31:57.030
Yes... but... it wasn't just one spirit...

31:57.030 --> 31:59.030
It was different

31:59.600 --> 32:01.830
It was really malevolent

32:03.300 --> 32:06.100
And this is what the gate is for...

32:06.100 --> 32:08.100
to keep this thing locked up?

32:08.460 --> 32:13.230
Yeah... but it's been there since the Eighteenth century...
or even before...

32:16.230 --> 32:17.960
Look Andy...

32:17.960 --> 32:20.860
Maybe we should look at what was written on the tablet

32:20.860 --> 32:22.830
I've got it typed up here

32:26.330 --> 32:28.300
It's implying that Gate One...

32:28.300 --> 32:32.160
is at the end of some line that begins at Stanton Drew.

32:32.730 --> 32:36.700
Stanton Drew is a huge stone circle just west of Bath

32:36.700 --> 32:41.660
I've been there lots of times. It's huge but somehow hardly known...

32:48.100 --> 32:51.030
Compton Dando is a village halfway between.

32:51.030 --> 32:53.800
There used to be a statue embedded in the wall of the church

32:53.800 --> 32:56.730
which was taken from the altar in the Roman temple...

32:56.730 --> 33:00.800
right by the hot spring here in Bath. Nobody knows how or why...

33:00.800 --> 33:04.630
The royal circus we know was built by Wood, father and son

33:04.630 --> 33:08.700
and it's diameter deliberately matches that of stonehenge.

33:09.130 --> 33:13.900
It has an occult significance supposedly signifying the sun...

33:16.300 --> 33:20.930
Look at these, all round the circus, deliberately placed by Wood.

33:21.300 --> 33:24.730
Maybe Woods and Thomas Jelly knew about the six gates

33:24.730 --> 33:26.260
and whatever is locked behind it

33:43.060 --> 33:46.300
So, we didn't find anything, but on the way back

33:46.300 --> 33:49.900
Jack wanted to explore a place we'd seen near Compton Dando

33:49.900 --> 33:51.560
It's called Fairy Hill

33:51.560 --> 33:53.930
Close by something called Drakes Well

33:53.930 --> 33:56.330
He said he had a feeling about it

33:56.330 --> 33:59.000
Turned out he was right

34:11.530 --> 34:13.600
What are we looking for Jack?

34:13.600 --> 34:17.330
I'm not sure. Maybe a spring...

34:30.630 --> 34:32.699
Just heard a weird sound

34:33.699 --> 34:38.000
Like an animal... but weird

34:40.900 --> 34:43.699
We're a bit nervous to be honest

34:47.360 --> 34:49.330
Did you hear the noise?

34:54.030 --> 34:56.330
Weird!

35:01.500 --> 35:04.800
Seen this Andy? It's the spring

35:07.130 --> 35:10.960
There! Bloody Hell! Freaky!

35:16.500 --> 35:18.000
Shit!

35:25.330 --> 35:27.760
What the hell was that?

35:51.160 --> 35:56.030
Now St James is destroyed he will escape! ... And you...

35:56.600 --> 35:58.560
will be marked!

35:58.560 --> 36:00.960
What do you mean? Who will escape?

36:03.030 --> 36:05.160
Ha! You don't know?

36:05.160 --> 36:07.100
Just keep away

36:07.100 --> 36:12.330
There's only one way to deal with this! Keep away!

36:20.360 --> 36:22.700
What the hell?

36:28.630 --> 36:34.530
He was pretty angry... but he was scared too.

36:38.900 --> 36:41.330
OK. So Crouch said a couple of key things.

36:41.830 --> 36:45.760
Now that St.James is destroyed he will escape...

36:51.860 --> 36:54.000
So this is St. Jame's church

36:54.000 --> 36:58.800
a big full on church right in the middle of Bath and then...

37:01.500 --> 37:04.560
OK... this is where St. James church used to be...

37:04.560 --> 37:08.030
but it was demolished in the nineteen fifties and now...

37:08.030 --> 37:10.400
the site is being built over

37:10.400 --> 37:14.000
St James... founded by King Alfred the Great...

37:14.000 --> 37:19.000
rebuilt by Thomas Jelly... now it's gone.

37:19.000 --> 37:22.800
There's been a burial ground here since medieval times...

37:22.800 --> 37:24.730
underneath this building site

37:25.830 --> 37:27.300
All gone.

37:27.560 --> 37:34.130
Now St James is destroyed he will escape and you... will be MARKED!

37:41.960 --> 37:45.300
I've just been editing...

37:45.300 --> 37:50.860
and I heard a sound from downstairs like a girl screaming...

37:50.860 --> 37:57.230
but I'm the only one here... Jack and Lola have gone out.

37:57.230 --> 38:02.600
So I'm just going to have a look downstairs to see if anyone's there

38:09.530 --> 38:10.630
There!

38:11.830 --> 38:14.100
Lola?

38:25.730 --> 38:27.730
This is bloody weird.

38:33.730 --> 38:36.760
Bloody light's gone.

38:39.530 --> 38:41.760
Lola, are you there?

38:43.030 --> 38:46.430
No! ... That was... that was real...

38:49.260 --> 38:51.230
Shit!

38:53.730 --> 38:56.360
It's really freaking me out

39:08.300 --> 39:10.260
What was that?

39:11.230 --> 39:12.760
There's something out there

39:22.900 --> 39:27.060
Oh my God!

39:30.930 --> 39:33.630
Don't know what went on there...

39:35.430 --> 39:37.930
I must admit I was scared...

39:43.030 --> 39:47.500
But if I don't believe in ghosts... then what am I scared of?

39:47.500 --> 39:50.460
It's like, it can't hurt me...

39:50.460 --> 39:52.930
But... I was scared...

39:52.930 --> 39:56.500
the thought of a dead person's spirit...

39:56.500 --> 39:58.960
kind of messes with your mind a bit...

39:58.960 --> 40:02.360
It's like... trying to get into my mind...

40:02.360 --> 40:03.900
like a kind of madness

40:04.160 --> 40:05.900
like a kind of madness

40:10.900 --> 40:12.130
Madness

40:19.000 --> 40:21.700
The spirit really scared Jack.

40:21.700 --> 40:24.830
I'm getting worried because the... influence is spreading...

40:24.830 --> 40:26.560
and getting more powerful.

40:27.930 --> 40:32.360
And both Lola and I have the same feeling of foreboding

40:33.800 --> 40:36.030
We think it's blood

40:41.030 --> 40:45.130
There's no way of telling what or who it can get to...

40:45.130 --> 40:47.100
You will be marked!

40:47.100 --> 40:51.130
So, it's getting to us... and Jack's had enough...

40:51.130 --> 40:54.130
we're going to find Crouch and talk to him.

40:54.130 --> 40:54.230
OK... so we wanted to go and see Crouch
we're going to find Crouch and talk to him.

40:54.230 --> 40:58.630
OK... so we wanted to go and see Crouch

40:58.630 --> 41:01.360
but he wasn't there, the receptionist said

41:01.360 --> 41:05.300
then we asked to see Jim the security guard but he's off sick...

41:05.930 --> 41:12.760
So... I'm going to break into Crouch's
store room and go through the gate.

41:15.260 --> 41:17.460
I need to find out what's there

41:17.460 --> 41:20.300
Andy's agreed to come with me...

41:20.800 --> 41:24.600
But Lola's going to stay outside. I can't afford to risk Lola again.

41:26.760 --> 41:32.960
So Lola's going to watch out if the
receptionist goes to the loo or something

41:36.560 --> 41:39.130
Ok, it's clear

42:19.730 --> 42:21.600
alright?

42:49.630 --> 42:55.160
If this goes wrong... get out as quick as you can... understand?

42:57.160 --> 42:58.830
Ready?

42:59.460 --> 43:01.530
Just this bolt holding it...

43:03.560 --> 43:05.060
Oh, it's stiff

43:26.260 --> 43:28.530
Herne... the god... no... It goes on for miles!

43:31.200 --> 43:33.160
What was that?

43:36.500 --> 43:40.060
OK? Let's get moving

44:07.730 --> 44:11.030
Andy, come on... keep up

44:22.700 --> 44:24.600
This is weird

44:28.130 --> 44:29.900
I don't like this

44:31.930 --> 44:35.360
You alright? I think there is something up ahead

44:40.960 --> 44:43.160
There's a staircase going up

44:43.160 --> 44:45.230
just there...

44:49.500 --> 44:52.800
Oh no...

45:21.030 --> 45:26.130
Herne... the god... no...

45:26.130 --> 45:28.700
What... in there?

45:30.800 --> 45:33.130
Do we open it?

45:36.900 --> 45:38.030
The lids moving

45:38.030 --> 45:41.460
I can smell it now... rotten meat.

45:43.700 --> 45:45.130
What do we do?

45:45.130 --> 45:47.330
They’re coming down the stairs

45:47.360 --> 45:50.360
Quick go back down the corridor a bit.

45:50.360 --> 45:52.360
Come on!

46:13.200 --> 46:15.500
Muttered incantations echoing.

46:55.730 --> 46:56.960
Shit... that was...

46:58.630 --> 47:00.600
Oh my god

47:01.460 --> 47:04.000
Oh my god that was something...

47:22.760 --> 47:25.100
This is bad

47:29.100 --> 47:31.730
Shhh... he's just ahead...

47:34.430 --> 47:37.000
Something bad happened back there...

47:37.000 --> 47:39.060
There's something wrong...

47:41.630 --> 47:44.530
Careful, we're near the gate

47:46.900 --> 47:48.600
It's open

47:53.600 --> 47:55.860
Yeah, it's clear

47:57.760 --> 47:59.500
He's still moving

48:18.700 --> 48:20.300
Did someone just come past?

48:20.300 --> 48:21.530
Yes... Mr. Crouch

48:21.530 --> 48:22.460
Has he gone outside?

48:22.460 --> 48:25.400
Yes... what's going on?

48:28.630 --> 48:30.760
Crouch just came out... He's over there!

48:32.030 --> 48:34.760
Crouch!... He looks bloody weird...

48:34.760 --> 48:36.260
Crouch! Wait!

48:40.930 --> 48:44.260
Crouch... you alright? What happened?

48:45.160 --> 48:46.260
Jack!

48:46.260 --> 48:47.560
You alright?

48:47.560 --> 48:50.700
Andy get back... it's dangerous!

48:53.530 --> 48:55.230
That not Crouch.

48:55.230 --> 48:57.300
What do you mean it's not Crouch?

48:57.300 --> 48:59.300
It's taken him.

48:59.300 --> 49:03.230
Let it go… let it go…

49:24.430 --> 49:29.800
So Jack... the big question... What went on back there?

49:29.800 --> 49:34.560
Well... We found a chamber

49:35.730 --> 49:39.330
with a sarcophagus in it with... Herne on it.

49:39.330 --> 49:44.260
Crouch cam in and did some kind of ritual...

49:44.930 --> 49:49.960
then something came out of the sarcophagus and took hold of Crouch...

49:50.730 --> 49:52.860
That wasn't Crouch

49:52.860 --> 49:56.460
It had the same hatred inside it

49:57.760 --> 50:00.060
So what do we do?

50:00.760 --> 50:03.960
Be on our guard... whatever happened...

50:09.260 --> 50:12.400
So it's been six weeks

50:12.800 --> 50:15.460
there's no sign of Crouch

50:15.460 --> 50:20.900
His office is closed, phone is dead... there's no trace of him

50:20.900 --> 50:26.000
So we were thinking... that it might all have gone away...

50:26.000 --> 50:31.130
But... Then this happened...

50:33.760 --> 50:37.630
Somebody pushed it through the letterbox.

50:38.360 --> 50:42.860
So we don't know...

50:46.130 --> 50:50.430
whatever that was... inside Crouch...

50:51.230 --> 50:54.930
It's out there. It's out there somewhere.

51:02.860 --> 51:06.400
We uncovered an occult mystery in the city of Bath

51:06.400 --> 51:10.730
The Entity, the Demon has broken free

51:22.300 --> 51:26.760
It's been over a year since we filmed any of the Occult Angel stuff

51:26.760 --> 51:29.960
and really I haven't had much to do with it...

51:29.960 --> 51:31.930
for various reasons –

51:31.930 --> 51:33.800
I moved out of Jack's house,

51:33.800 --> 51:36.830
Um... Lola left...

51:38.030 --> 51:42.530
and... also it scared me.

51:44.100 --> 51:48.330
So Andy has finished university and has got a pretty good graphics job

51:48.330 --> 51:50.600
but I’ve asked him to film again…

51:50.600 --> 51:54.060
to explain how there’s been a significant change.

51:55.360 --> 51:59.430
First off I had to get out of my house
because we received what was a threat...

51:59.430 --> 52:03.260
But since then we received this...

52:03.260 --> 52:06.700
You see, this letter is different – not threatening like the last one

52:06.700 --> 52:08.300
more like a clue.

52:09.930 --> 52:13.400
So I checked out this ELA organisation

52:13.400 --> 52:15.300
and couldn't find anything at all

52:15.300 --> 52:18.860
until last week when I realised...

52:20.160 --> 52:22.430
So I'm here at Lacock

52:22.430 --> 52:28.700
which is national trust building about fifteen miles outside of Bath

52:31.200 --> 52:34.400
Originally a 13th century monastery...

52:34.400 --> 52:37.100
and guess who founded it...

52:39.000 --> 52:42.860
So there you are E. L. A.... Ela.

52:42.860 --> 52:45.530
You can see that Lacock is on a line

52:45.530 --> 52:47.500
A conduit…

52:54.000 --> 52:57.360
A conduit… which leads to gate 5.

52:57.360 --> 53:00.630
Just like the Stanton Drew Conduit leads to gate 1…

53:00.630 --> 53:03.860
So nearby we found this.

53:11.700 --> 53:13.630
Come and have a film up here Andy.

53:15.030 --> 53:16.260
Oh!

53:21.300 --> 53:22.900
Listen!

53:23.930 --> 53:25.900
That sound again.

53:38.730 --> 53:40.860
The Herne entity is near here...

53:42.330 --> 53:45.000
I can feel it... it's the same uh...

53:47.000 --> 53:48.260
What is that?

53:48.260 --> 53:51.400
You are marked!

53:55.800 --> 53:57.900
Wait a minute... turn it off

53:59.660 --> 54:01.900
We have no idea who that figure was…

54:01.900 --> 54:04.200
but it felt like we were being checked out.

54:08.160 --> 54:10.030
And then over the following seasons…

54:10.030 --> 54:12.460
always at Beltane and Samain…

54:12.460 --> 54:15.100
we received more instructions.

54:20.700 --> 54:22.700
Again they are like riddles.

54:22.700 --> 54:25.060
Showing the connections with the Occult Gates.

54:34.000 --> 54:37.430
Gate Four, Stonehenge ravaged

54:37.960 --> 54:40.660
Marden destroyed by our enemies

54:40.660 --> 54:43.430
Marsden was a massive henge

54:43.430 --> 54:46.700
But most of it was destroyed in the Eighteenth Century.

54:49.600 --> 54:52.200
And we found the signs

54:55.200 --> 55:00.700
Clee is a beautiful, mysterious hill. South East of Bath.

55:11.860 --> 55:15.560
Gate Two, St Michael’s to St. Michael’s

55:15.560 --> 55:18.660
The conduit of the Tor is closed

55:18.660 --> 55:22.130
This must be the famous Glastonbury Tor

55:24.630 --> 55:27.600
The Saint Michael’s link is clear.

55:34.330 --> 55:36.330
Gate 6. To the North are the Hwicce.

55:36.330 --> 55:38.930
There was a kingdom to the North of Bath.

55:38.930 --> 55:43.960
The land of the Hwicce. The people of witchcraft.

55:43.960 --> 55:47.000
We felt we were being told to keep away.

55:47.000 --> 55:50.830
The conduit at Horningsham remains.

55:50.830 --> 55:55.200
This place is south of Bath… high on a hill

56:06.300 --> 56:09.160
The Durotrigan Giant is our guardian.

56:09.160 --> 56:11.630
I knew exactly what this meant...

56:11.630 --> 56:14.030
The Cerne Abbas giant.

56:15.100 --> 56:19.160
This ancient carving is in the heart of the land of the Durotriges.

56:19.160 --> 56:21.100
A Celtic tribe.

56:25.600 --> 56:29.800
The name links it with Cernunnos or Herne.

56:32.000 --> 56:36.460
So, we visit each site… And there is always a symbol or a sign…

56:36.460 --> 56:39.400
like we’re being lead towards something…

56:39.400 --> 56:43.030
A conduit showing the connection with the occult gates

56:43.030 --> 56:46.460
This last communication talks of pilgrimage…

56:46.460 --> 56:48.500
and that’s what it felt like

56:55.760 --> 57:01.500
A beautiful pilgrimage across the pagan
landscape of South West England.

57:19.030 --> 57:22.000
But a pilgrimage has to lead somewhere…

57:22.960 --> 57:25.500
When we got back from Cerne Abbas

57:25.500 --> 57:28.200
this was on my computer.

57:33.400 --> 57:37.630
Pilgrim. You have followed our riddles

57:37.630 --> 57:40.260
and you desire more.

57:41.260 --> 57:47.700
But, you cannot intervene without consequences.

57:47.700 --> 57:51.530
Consider this before you choose.

58:11.530 --> 58:17.860
We are the Nemeton... The dark enemy

58:17.860 --> 58:21.300
We have revealed ourselves.

58:23.430 --> 58:26.360
You have seen the demon

58:27.460 --> 58:32.530
You saw it attack... and devour

58:33.930 --> 58:36.630
Will you be chosen?

58:37.360 --> 58:41.230
Or will you enter the path of sacrifice?

58:43.530 --> 58:46.930
Tread carefully pilgrim.

58:58.730 --> 59:02.300
Well, I realise we are playing with fire here…

59:04.400 --> 59:07.260
Maybe we should just walk away and forget it...

59:07.660 --> 59:10.760
But I can't... I can't stop now!

59:11.830 --> 59:16.930
Andy is … upset by this. You know he’s not happy…

59:16.930 --> 59:19.130
but he’s going to stick with me… Yeah?

59:19.130 --> 59:20.360
Yeah...

59:20.700 --> 59:24.060
OK, we’ll lets just see what happens.

59:32.730 --> 59:33.560
Madness...

59:33.560 --> 59:35.400
Like a kind of madness...

59:36.900 --> 59:38.700
Madness

59:40.200 --> 59:42.860
When Herne takes your breath

59:44.760 --> 59:49.660
Madness will crawl through your soul

59:54.530 --> 59:56.330
Andy are you OK?

59:56.330 --> 59:58.160
You’re scaring me…

59:58.160 --> 01:00:02.130
You don’t… seem the same.

01:00:02.730 --> 01:00:05.160
Maybe you should get some help…

01:00:06.030 --> 01:00:09.000
Andy… this is, serious…

01:00:09.830 --> 01:00:13.330
Mr. Roberts. You have chosen.

01:00:13.330 --> 01:00:16.360
We will infect you.

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:20.000
You will serve us.

01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:41.330
So it’s been a few years since Andy made the videos, a long time…

01:00:41.330 --> 01:00:44.700
and there’s… been quite a bit of bad stuff

01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:48.060
Especially for Andy. He’s not been well.

01:00:51.130 --> 01:00:54.630
I've been trying to keep my head down…

01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:04.330
But over this period of time I’ve been receiving communications…

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:09.060
I don't know who they're from

01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:12.930
The letters never say anything clear.

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:17.900
Until this last one arrived, and it said this.

01:01:22.230 --> 01:01:26.500
So a man rang, I don't know who, just a voice…

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:28.960
and gave us a location

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:31.600
So we’re going there now.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:36.400
I don’t … I’m scared. But we need to know... so...

01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:43.600
OK. We are here at the location.

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:48.560
All I can say is that we're near the Cerne giant in Dorset

01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:53.630
Look at all those Rooks!

01:01:55.730 --> 01:01:59.130
They’re like an alarm… like sentinels.

01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:11.430
Come on!

01:02:31.830 --> 01:02:34.060
Looks like we’re expected

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:46.330
Look... Look! Over there...

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.300
Ok, this is it...

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.060
Careful...

01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:20.360
There’s another one.

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:22.360
They’re all around us.

01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:30.030
I don’t like this… it doesn’t feel safe…

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:50.130
Ok… We’ll go in.

01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:54.800
You alright Andy?

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:16.300
To be chosen, or sacrificed.

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:22.360
Mr Andy Roberts was chosen…

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:30.800
And as our loyal servant...

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:37.030
he procured Mr. Jack Angel for sacrifice.

01:04:56.330 --> 01:05:00.900
You violated my sanctuary.

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:17.430
This is a warning for all who try to find us.

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:20.700
You have been traced

01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:23.600
you are marked.

01:05:24.530 --> 01:05:26.660
Look behind you...

01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:34.060
Look behind you. Death is at your shoulder.
