00:12.646 --> 00:14.215

Go, Dottie.

00:25.159 --> 00:26.394
- Go, Daddy.
- Go, Daddy.

00:26.427 --> 00:27.395
- Okay, Mommy's turn.

00:27.428 --> 00:28.429
- Hold up.
- Mommy!

00:28.462 --> 00:30.531
- Hey, mama.
Oh, mama.

00:30.564 --> 00:32.466
Here we go.

I'm feeling fine *

00:55.089 --> 00:58.692
- Since this is your third
broken bone in two years,

00:58.726 --> 01:01.562
I ordered a DEXA Scan,
and I'm glad I did,

01:01.595 --> 01:04.732
because the results
confirmed my hunch.

01:04.765 --> 01:06.400
- Which was?

01:06.434 --> 01:08.502
- You have advanced osteopenia.

01:08.536 --> 01:10.638
- Is that--am I gonna live?

01:10.671 --> 01:12.406
- Yes, you'll live.

01:12.440 --> 01:15.143
It just means that you have
the bones of an 82-year-old.

01:15.176 --> 01:16.777
- What?
- Give or take a year.

01:16.810 --> 01:19.547
- How is that possible?
What did I do wrong?

01:19.580 --> 01:21.149
- Often, it's purely hereditary,

01:21.182 --> 01:22.783
but bone loss can be exacerbated

01:22.816 --> 01:24.618
by lack of exercise,

01:24.652 --> 01:26.220
excessive alcohol consumption,

01:26.254 --> 01:27.788
coffee, cola,

01:27.821 --> 01:29.357
alcohol.

01:29.390 --> 01:30.624
- You said that already.

01:30.658 --> 01:31.625
[scanner beeps]

01:31.659 --> 01:32.626
- Did you find everything

01:32.660 --> 01:33.761
you needed today?

01:33.794 --> 01:35.229
- Uh, yeah.

01:35.263 --> 01:36.764
Not in a global sense,
but yeah.

01:36.797 --> 01:38.166
- Do you have a club card?

01:38.166 --> 01:40.534
- Oh, man, I do,

01:40.568 --> 01:41.835
but not with me.

01:41.869 --> 01:43.204
- That's okay.
We can pull it up

01:43.237 --> 01:44.205
with your phone number.

01:44.238 --> 01:46.307
- Oh, great.
917...

01:48.276 --> 01:50.244
Uh, 917.

01:51.345 --> 01:53.214
Sorry.

01:53.247 --> 01:56.184
It's 917...

01:56.217 --> 01:57.185
What's wrong with me?

01:57.218 --> 01:58.486
I know this.

02:01.455 --> 02:03.224
What is my phone number?

02:03.257 --> 02:04.692
- I know your phone number.
Want me to tell you?

02:04.725 --> 02:06.260
- No, don't.

02:06.294 --> 02:08.196
I want to see how long
it takes me to remember.

02:08.229 --> 02:09.697
Do I have Alzheimer's?

02:09.730 --> 02:12.266
- No. Remember at the movies,
when I couldn't remember

02:12.300 --> 02:14.202
what's-her-face's name,
with the hair?

02:14.235 --> 02:15.336
From that show we used to love?

02:15.369 --> 02:17.205
- Oh, yeah.
I love her.

02:17.238 --> 02:18.272
What's her name again?

02:18.306 --> 02:19.440
- I have no idea.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.309
But you keep changing
the subject.

02:21.342 --> 02:23.444
- From what?
I can't remember.

02:23.477 --> 02:24.578
- Graham.

02:24.612 --> 02:26.547
- Oh, yeah.
It's fine.

02:26.580 --> 02:29.617
We kissed for a second, and then
I came back to my senses,

02:29.650 --> 02:31.118
and now he's staying
with a cousin.

02:31.219 --> 02:32.386
- Okay, good riddance.

02:32.420 --> 02:33.654
See ya never, Graham.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.389
Sorry I'm talking
like Cindy Brady.

02:35.423 --> 02:36.724
I just put in a new Invisalign.

02:36.757 --> 02:38.392
- Oh, I couldn't tell.

02:38.426 --> 02:40.794
I forgot you and Hazel
are doing that whole

02:40.828 --> 02:42.363
mother-daughter
teeth straightening thing.

02:42.396 --> 02:43.664
You guys are so cute.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.333
- Yeah, well, when your
ten-year-old tells you

02:45.366 --> 02:47.134
that you have
"granny teeth,"

02:47.235 --> 02:48.236
you have to take action.

02:48.236 --> 02:49.570
- What is wrong with us?

02:49.603 --> 02:51.239
Everyone's always saying things

02:51.239 --> 02:52.873
like, "60 is the new 40."

02:52.906 --> 02:54.242
- Oh, no.
That's bullshit.

02:54.275 --> 02:55.609
40 is the new 70.

02:55.643 --> 02:57.611
- 70?
Okay, you wish.

02:57.645 --> 02:59.613
- Ooh, I like that bag.

02:59.647 --> 03:01.482
- Yeah, I think
it's a Von Weber.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.716
- Oh, my God.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.685
That's one of Brooke's bags?

03:04.718 --> 03:05.919
- [stammers]

03:05.953 --> 03:08.155
Sorry.
- That's not funny.

03:08.256 --> 03:10.258
I just liked something
that Brooke designed.

03:10.291 --> 03:11.725
It was like a blind
taste test

03:11.759 --> 03:12.726
that I failed.

03:12.760 --> 03:13.827
- It's a cute bag.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.663
Don't be so hard on yourself.

03:15.696 --> 03:18.266
- No, if she's designing
something that's actually good,

03:18.266 --> 03:19.400
I can't make fun of her.

03:19.433 --> 03:20.734
Her career is en fuego,

03:20.768 --> 03:23.904
and I'm shooting
doorman head shots for free.

03:23.937 --> 03:26.607
- No, you just need
to work on your hustle.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.776
Have you ever
pitched yourself to Brooke?

03:28.809 --> 03:30.444
- Ugh, no.

03:30.478 --> 03:33.347
First of all, you can't mix
work and family.

03:33.381 --> 03:35.283
That's inevitable disaster,

03:35.316 --> 03:36.684
and second, she knows what I do.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.586
She could've hired me
if she wanted to.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.554
- Well, you don't ask,
you don't get.

03:40.588 --> 03:41.555
You're 82.

03:41.589 --> 03:42.556
What are you gonna do,

03:42.590 --> 03:43.557
wait until you're 90

03:43.591 --> 03:44.725
to get your career in gear?

03:44.758 --> 03:45.726
- Ow.

03:45.759 --> 03:48.195
Elder abuse.

03:48.296 --> 03:50.197
- That was delicious, guys.
Thanks again.

03:50.298 --> 03:51.465
- Hello, Anderson.

03:51.499 --> 03:52.866
- Hey, what are you doing here?

03:52.900 --> 03:54.502
- Hi.

03:54.535 --> 03:57.471
I'm meeting Celia
for our standing lunch date.

03:57.505 --> 03:59.440
And who have we here?

03:59.473 --> 04:01.675
- These are the wunderkinds
I was telling you about:

04:01.709 --> 04:03.611
Chad and Omar,
from my new job.

04:03.644 --> 04:05.546
- Yes.
Charmed, I'm sure.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.615
Is the rest of the company
this handsome?

04:07.648 --> 04:09.417
- [laughs]
This is my mother,

04:09.450 --> 04:10.418
Mrs. von Weber.

04:10.451 --> 04:12.486
- Oh, so we have you to thank

04:12.520 --> 04:13.754
for bringing Andy
into the world.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.323
[both laugh]

04:15.356 --> 04:16.824
- Anderson, may I have a word?

04:16.857 --> 04:18.626
- Sure, I'll see you guys
back at the office.

04:18.659 --> 04:19.927
- Nice meeting you.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.929
- Yes.

04:21.962 --> 04:22.996
How dare you embarrass me
that way?

04:23.030 --> 04:24.498
- What?
What did I say?

04:24.532 --> 04:26.400
- You know goddamn well
what you said.

04:26.434 --> 04:29.337
You introduced me
as your mother.

04:29.337 --> 04:30.771
- Are you not my mother?

04:30.804 --> 04:32.906
- Must I spell everything out
for you?

04:32.940 --> 04:35.008
You are a middle-aged man now,

04:35.042 --> 04:37.511
so think about how that
impacts me.

04:37.545 --> 04:38.546
- You?

04:38.579 --> 04:40.348
- Yes.

04:40.348 --> 04:42.516
You are so self-involved.

04:42.550 --> 04:44.552
Until further notice,

04:44.585 --> 04:46.754
I would prefer
that you introduce me

04:46.787 --> 04:48.722
as your dear friend.

04:48.756 --> 04:51.825
- Your table is ready,
Mrs. von Weber.

04:51.859 --> 04:56.430
*

04:56.464 --> 05:00.401
- So, wow, this is
like a real wedding dress.

05:00.434 --> 05:01.669
- But do you think
it's solemn enough

05:01.702 --> 05:02.670
for the occasion?

05:02.703 --> 05:03.904
- Well, I mean, given that

05:03.937 --> 05:05.439
it's just a vows renewal, I--

05:05.473 --> 05:07.408
- "Just a vows renewal?"

05:07.441 --> 05:09.577
- Jill, this is much
more meaningful

05:09.610 --> 05:10.711
than a wedding.

05:10.744 --> 05:12.446
Lex and I have been
to darker places

05:12.480 --> 05:14.548
than you could
ever understand.

05:16.817 --> 05:17.885
- Anyway.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.019
Shifting gears,

05:19.052 --> 05:21.789
I just wanted to remind you

05:21.822 --> 05:23.757
that I'm still pluggin' away

05:23.791 --> 05:27.027
at ye old photography biz,

05:27.060 --> 05:29.730
just in case, you know,

05:29.763 --> 05:32.600
you...

05:32.633 --> 05:34.535
- Yes?

05:34.568 --> 05:36.904
- Well, I mean, no pressure,
but if you ever need

05:36.937 --> 05:40.040
a photographer for anything...

05:40.073 --> 05:42.610
- Oh, you're asking me
for a job.

05:42.643 --> 05:44.812
Jill, I say this with love.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.915
I believe mixing
work and family

05:47.948 --> 05:50.818
is never wise.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.620
- Yeah, I have heard that said.

05:52.653 --> 05:53.621
Sorry.

05:53.654 --> 05:54.788
- Don't be sorry.

05:54.822 --> 05:56.624
I just know so much more now,

05:56.657 --> 05:59.059
and I want to share
my wisdom with you.

05:59.092 --> 06:01.061
Janice, how's it going in there?

06:01.094 --> 06:02.596
- You tell me.

06:02.630 --> 06:04.998
What do you think?
- Oh, my God.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.600
Beyond love.

06:06.634 --> 06:08.436
Jill, this is
my bridesmaids' dress.

06:08.436 --> 06:09.437
Isn't it heaven?

06:09.437 --> 06:10.438
- Yeah.

06:10.438 --> 06:11.439
I mean, it might be

06:11.439 --> 06:13.607
a little slinky for me.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.943
- [laughing]
Oh, no, no, no, no.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.044
This is for the other girls.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.612
They're by Amsale.

06:18.646 --> 06:21.482
I have something much more
age-appropriate for you.

06:21.515 --> 06:23.451
Janice here definitely
has the booty for it.

06:23.451 --> 06:25.453
- Seriously,
it runs in my family.

06:25.453 --> 06:26.920
- Yeah.

06:26.954 --> 06:27.921
- Well, that was easy.

06:27.955 --> 06:29.657
- Yeah.

06:29.690 --> 06:32.593
Isn't that color the best
for her skin tone?

06:32.626 --> 06:35.663
She's so Lupita Nyong'o.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.130
- I don't see that.

06:37.164 --> 06:39.633
- Tara, the gown.

06:39.667 --> 06:43.571
Here is your
matron of honor gown.

06:43.604 --> 06:44.705
Bring it in.

06:44.738 --> 06:45.839
Thank you.

06:47.174 --> 06:48.476
- Holy shit.

06:48.476 --> 06:49.477
- I know.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.111
Gorgeous, right?

06:51.144 --> 06:54.047
I thought if anyone
can pull off a drapey sheath,

06:54.081 --> 06:55.649
it's J-to-the-izzle.

06:55.683 --> 06:58.486
- Is this also Amsale?

06:59.853 --> 07:01.388
- Sweetie, no.

07:01.489 --> 07:02.756
It's someone else.

07:02.790 --> 07:05.493
And listen, about your career.

07:05.493 --> 07:06.994
It may not feel this way,

07:07.027 --> 07:08.629
but I'm doing you a favor

07:08.662 --> 07:10.030
by not handing you a job.

07:10.063 --> 07:12.132
You'll get there
on your own, like I did,

07:12.165 --> 07:15.402
and it'll feel so good.

07:15.503 --> 07:16.804
Now go try on this dress.

07:16.837 --> 07:19.540
*

07:26.614 --> 07:28.048
inging]
- Let me guess.
You need a kidney.

07:28.081 --> 07:29.650
- No, I'm just calling
to say hi.

07:29.683 --> 07:31.118
- You'd think
when you divorce someone,

07:31.151 --> 07:32.986
they might get the hint.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.421
- Actually, I do
want something from you.

07:34.522 --> 07:35.689
- I knew it.

07:35.723 --> 07:37.024
- I'd like to take you
to dinner.

07:37.057 --> 07:38.759
You know, just as a thank-you

07:38.792 --> 07:40.193
for picking me up
at the airport,

07:40.227 --> 07:41.962
keeping me hydrated,
all that stuff.

07:41.995 --> 07:42.963
- So not necessary.

07:42.996 --> 07:43.964
Think of it this way.

07:43.997 --> 07:44.965
I could now teach a course

07:44.998 --> 07:46.600
on yak polio protocol.

07:46.634 --> 07:47.935
- Don't be difficult.

07:47.968 --> 07:50.170
Just say yes.

07:50.203 --> 07:53.607
[rock music]

07:53.641 --> 07:56.644
[phone ringing
"Bad to the Bone"]

07:58.546 --> 07:59.880
- 1-800-crypt-keeper.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.549
How may I direct your call?

08:01.582 --> 08:02.816
- Yes, hi, I'd like
to be connected

08:02.850 --> 08:04.652
to your Alzheimer's department?

08:04.685 --> 08:06.153
Why did I
divorce Graham again?

08:06.186 --> 08:07.988
- Is this a trick question?
I give up.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.557
- I seriously can't remember,

08:09.557 --> 08:10.724
and he's taking me out
to dinner,

08:10.758 --> 08:12.059
and I need to be armed.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.594
I can't backslide again.

08:13.627 --> 08:15.763
- Okay, you know
I always liked Graham,

08:15.796 --> 08:17.998
but you two were
a disaster together.

08:18.031 --> 08:20.100
For one thing,
he was always rude to your mom--

08:20.133 --> 08:21.969
- Well, she doesn't
understand sarcasm.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.070
- Also, he's a know-it-all.

08:23.103 --> 08:24.572
- Yeah, but to be fair,

08:24.572 --> 08:25.739
I should read international news

08:25.773 --> 08:27.040
before skipping
to the op-ed page.

08:27.074 --> 08:28.909
- And Graham was never around.

08:28.942 --> 08:31.111
He was always off
saving the world.

08:31.144 --> 08:32.880
- Is that it?
Because at this point, the idea

08:32.913 --> 08:34.481
of being married to someone

08:34.582 --> 08:36.917
who's never around seems ideal.
- No, there were

08:36.950 --> 08:38.118
other things too.
[buzzer sounds]

08:38.151 --> 08:39.953
I can hear you
getting sucked in.

08:39.987 --> 08:41.655
Hi.
Come on up.

08:41.689 --> 08:42.956
And speaking of sucking,

08:42.990 --> 08:44.925
I asked Brooke
for a photo assignment,

08:44.958 --> 08:46.193
and she told me

08:46.226 --> 08:48.128
she doesn't mix
work with family.

08:48.161 --> 08:49.963
- Oh, you should know by now
not to listen to me.

08:49.997 --> 08:50.964
- It's okay.

08:50.998 --> 08:52.700
Humiliation is my jet fuel.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.067
[doorbell rings]
Oh, I got to go.

08:54.101 --> 08:55.869
My doorman's here.
- Knock him dead.

08:55.903 --> 08:58.505
*

08:58.606 --> 08:59.773
- Okay, Carlton.

08:59.807 --> 09:01.108
Give me a deep breath.

09:01.141 --> 09:02.109
[exhales loudly]

09:02.142 --> 09:03.110
- [exhales]

09:03.143 --> 09:04.612
- Okay, perfect.
Now--

09:04.645 --> 09:06.780
[sings a scale]

09:06.814 --> 09:09.016
- [sings a scale]

09:09.049 --> 09:10.784
- Now a big laugh.
[laughs]

09:10.818 --> 09:11.785
- [laughing]

09:11.819 --> 09:13.120
- Ah, there we go.

09:13.153 --> 09:14.655
This is great.

09:14.688 --> 09:16.757
There's the smile
I was looking for.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.759
There's a bubbly personality
under that uniform.

09:18.792 --> 09:19.793
[camera shutter clicks]

09:19.827 --> 09:21.094
This is great.

09:21.128 --> 09:23.764
Okay, I think we have plenty
for the union.

09:23.797 --> 09:25.666
- Aw, I was just
starting to have fun.

09:25.699 --> 09:26.934
- Really?

09:26.967 --> 09:28.802
I mean, if you have
a little extra time,

09:28.836 --> 09:30.638
I'm trying to build up
my portfolio.

09:30.638 --> 09:32.640
We could do a few more
that are, like, looser,

09:32.640 --> 09:34.007
a little more "arty."

09:34.041 --> 09:35.242
- Um...

09:35.275 --> 09:36.744
[laughs]

09:36.777 --> 09:37.778
- No, if not, no worries.

09:37.811 --> 09:40.247
- Um...okay, sure.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.248
Why not?

09:41.281 --> 09:42.249
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

09:42.282 --> 09:43.250
- Okay, great.

09:43.283 --> 09:44.685
Let me just go get another lens.

09:44.718 --> 09:45.686
I'll be right back.

09:45.719 --> 09:46.687
Stand by.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.321
- [chuckles]

09:48.355 --> 09:50.891
- It'll just be a second.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.960
Normally I like to use
a medium lens

09:52.993 --> 09:54.027
for a portrait.

09:54.061 --> 09:55.562
Here we go.

09:55.663 --> 09:57.330
*

09:57.364 --> 09:58.699
This one will get me closer,

09:58.732 --> 10:01.134
so we can capture
every single...

10:01.168 --> 10:03.871
*

10:03.904 --> 10:05.238
Detail.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.708
- Is--is this okay?

10:07.741 --> 10:10.844
This is what you meant
by "arty," right?

10:10.878 --> 10:12.045
- Uh, sure.

10:12.079 --> 10:14.848
*

10:14.882 --> 10:16.784
- [humming]

10:16.817 --> 10:18.251
- Hi, is there anything

10:18.285 --> 10:19.619
I can help you with today?

10:19.653 --> 10:21.054
- Yes, I was hoping
you could help me

10:21.088 --> 10:23.290
with some anti-aging products.

10:23.323 --> 10:24.825
Moisturizers, lotions,

10:24.858 --> 10:26.894
anything that promotes
springy skin.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.361
You know, shrinks pores,

10:28.395 --> 10:29.930
erases broken blood vessels.

10:29.963 --> 10:30.998
- Certainly.

10:31.031 --> 10:32.065
If you'd like to sit down,

10:32.099 --> 10:33.133
I'd be happy to give you

10:33.166 --> 10:35.068
a personal consultation.

10:35.102 --> 10:36.937
- I beg your pardon.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.638
My face is as soft

10:38.672 --> 10:40.273
as the inner thigh of a newborn.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.175
It's my son that needs help.

10:42.209 --> 10:43.343
He's approaching middle age

10:43.376 --> 10:45.178
with no vanity, fear,

10:45.212 --> 10:47.614
or regard for how it affects
the rest of us.

10:47.647 --> 10:48.916
- Believe it or not,

10:48.949 --> 10:50.383
I see a lot of this.

10:51.952 --> 10:55.122
- I find that
strangely comforting.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.123
- Terrific.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.590
Smile, George.

10:57.624 --> 11:00.560
Work it.
W-E-R-Q.

11:00.728 --> 11:02.295
Flash those baby blues.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.164
And great.

11:04.197 --> 11:05.733
Head shot, three-quarter,

11:05.733 --> 11:07.000
profile.

11:07.034 --> 11:08.836
That's a wrap, George.

11:08.869 --> 11:11.371
- [stammering]
Oh, is that it?

11:11.404 --> 11:12.906
'Cause I heard you asked Carlton

11:12.940 --> 11:15.743
to do all kinds
of different shots.

11:16.944 --> 11:17.945
- I'm sorry, what?

11:17.978 --> 11:19.279
- Yeah.

11:19.312 --> 11:22.750
What's he got
that I don't?

11:22.750 --> 11:24.084
- Terrific, George.

11:24.117 --> 11:26.019
Yes, awesome, George.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.020
Secret!

11:27.054 --> 11:28.255
Ooh.

11:28.288 --> 11:29.356
Yes, Michael.

11:29.389 --> 11:31.759
Hello, bellman.
Dingdong.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.126
Fragile.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.127
Love those epaulets.

11:34.161 --> 11:35.362
Give me the other epaulet.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.030
And salute.

11:37.064 --> 11:38.031
All right, Abe.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.432
What's in the luggage?

11:39.466 --> 11:41.034
Blow that whistle.
Taxi!

11:41.068 --> 11:42.803
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.071
There's my bags.

11:44.104 --> 11:45.238
Make love to that lens.

11:45.272 --> 11:46.373
Give it to me, Mark.

11:46.406 --> 11:47.374
Yes.

11:47.407 --> 11:48.776
Work it.

11:48.809 --> 11:51.779
[jazzy music]

11:51.779 --> 11:54.782
[people conversing quietly]

11:56.950 --> 11:59.987
[rock music]

12:00.020 --> 12:01.321
- You know, not to brag,

12:01.354 --> 12:03.924
but these doorman photos
are really good.

12:03.957 --> 12:05.058
- That's great, honey.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.359
Can I take this thing off now?

12:06.393 --> 12:07.360
- No, your mother said--

12:07.394 --> 12:08.361
- Ah!

12:08.395 --> 12:09.863
"Dear friend."

12:09.897 --> 12:11.799
- [laughs]
Your "dear friend"

12:11.799 --> 12:13.366
said that you have to wear
Georgia Louise

12:13.400 --> 12:15.368
for 20 minutes every day

12:15.402 --> 12:16.970
if you want to look
like an embryo.

12:17.004 --> 12:20.007
[phone chiming]

12:21.341 --> 12:23.476
Did Lex mention
why they're so hell-bent

12:23.510 --> 12:25.946
on taking us to dinner tonight?
- Nope.

12:25.979 --> 12:26.980
- I bet you Brooke just wants

12:27.014 --> 12:28.015
to finish lecturing me

12:28.048 --> 12:29.817
on how to be a career gal.

12:29.850 --> 12:32.419
- And just because they're
on their second honeymoon,

12:32.452 --> 12:34.721
why do we have to eat dinner
in the middle of the night?

12:34.822 --> 12:35.823
This isn't Barthelona.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.124
- It's 9:45.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.826
It's not the middle
of the night.

12:38.826 --> 12:40.060
Let's get going.
- [grunts]

12:41.929 --> 12:44.031
[groans]

12:44.064 --> 12:46.033
- Oh, babe, no.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.134
Those jeans.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.368
- What, no jeans at this place?

12:48.401 --> 12:50.337
- Well, maybe jeans
at this place,

12:50.370 --> 12:52.072
but not dad jeans.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.174
You look like
a high school math teacher

12:54.207 --> 12:56.844
let loose at a buffet
at Mohegan Sun.

12:56.844 --> 12:57.945
- I like these jeans.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.079
They're comfortable!

12:59.112 --> 13:00.981
- All right.
Calm down.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.249
- No, I won't calm down.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.283
I am older than you.

13:03.316 --> 13:05.118
I am older than Lex.

13:05.152 --> 13:06.887
I'm older than my colleagues.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.923
Some people might even think
I'm older than my mother.

13:09.957 --> 13:10.924
I don't care.

13:10.958 --> 13:12.860
In fact, I am happier now

13:12.860 --> 13:14.862
than I was in my 20s
and my 30s.

13:14.862 --> 13:15.863
And you know what else?

13:15.863 --> 13:17.998
Brett Favre wears dad jeans.

13:18.031 --> 13:18.999
[phone ringing
"Bad to the Bone"]

13:19.032 --> 13:21.234
- Please take them off.

13:21.268 --> 13:23.370
Hi.

13:23.403 --> 13:25.438
- I think I just remembered
why I divorced Graham.

13:30.010 --> 13:30.878
- Now that Lex and I
are renewing our vows,

13:33.080 --> 13:35.215
we want to bring
some mystery and adventure

13:35.248 --> 13:36.483
into our marriage.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.285
- So we're eating dinner tonight

13:38.318 --> 13:39.887
in complete darkness.

13:39.920 --> 13:40.954
- Huh?
- What?

13:40.988 --> 13:41.922
- It's supposed to heighten

13:41.955 --> 13:42.956
all other senses.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.191
- Good for your palate

13:44.224 --> 13:46.894
and your libido, allegedly.
- Aww.

13:46.927 --> 13:48.228
- My senses were
already heightened

13:48.261 --> 13:49.796
when I heard we were eating
at 9:45.

13:49.897 --> 13:51.364
- Yeah, we're pretty tired too.

13:51.398 --> 13:53.800
Haven't been sleeping much
lately, if you know what I mean.

13:53.901 --> 13:55.468
- Yeah, we get it.
We get it.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.170
You're having lots of sex
'cause you're young.

13:57.204 --> 14:00.073
That's what young people do.
- Yeah.

14:00.107 --> 14:02.042
- Hello, and welcome
to Dinner in the Dark,

14:02.075 --> 14:03.810
a sensory adventure.

14:03.911 --> 14:05.545
We'll be putting on your masks
and lining you up

14:05.578 --> 14:07.915
as we review the dietary
restrictions you sent us.

14:07.948 --> 14:10.017
- Masks?
Seriously?

14:10.050 --> 14:12.319
No one asked us
our dietary restrictions.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.221
- Don't worry.
We got you covered.

14:14.254 --> 14:16.356
There's pretty much nothing
you guys don't eat, right?

14:16.389 --> 14:17.424
- Actually--
- Um.

14:17.457 --> 14:19.927
- Great.
Now, for Mrs. von Weber.

14:19.927 --> 14:22.829
No dairy, no gluten,
no meat, no oil,

14:22.930 --> 14:24.998
no vinegar, no starch,
no sugar.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.833
Is that everything?
- Sounds right.

14:26.934 --> 14:28.335
- And for Mr. von Weber.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.137
No soy, no bivalves,

14:30.170 --> 14:31.471
no grapefruit, no dill,

14:31.504 --> 14:34.607
no asparagus tips or bottoms--
just the middle--

14:34.641 --> 14:36.209
and American broccoli only.

14:36.243 --> 14:37.945
I assume that means
no Chinese broccoli

14:37.945 --> 14:39.346
or broccoli rabe?
- You got it.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.081
Lead me to my dinner.

14:41.114 --> 14:44.985
*

14:48.956 --> 14:51.959
- I am so, so sorry I'm late.

14:51.959 --> 14:56.163
You have no idea
the day I just had,

14:56.196 --> 14:58.098
but it doesn't matter.

15:01.268 --> 15:03.370
I should've called.
I should've texted.

15:03.403 --> 15:07.007
You can literally bite
my entire head off.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.441
I deserve it.

15:08.475 --> 15:10.443
- It's okay.

15:10.477 --> 15:11.544
- What?
Why are you smiling?

15:11.578 --> 15:12.645
It's freaking me out.

15:12.679 --> 15:14.414
- It's fine, really.

15:14.447 --> 15:15.415
Let's order.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.217
- No, it's not fine.

15:17.250 --> 15:20.187
What's going on?
Don't you want to bawl me out?

15:20.220 --> 15:22.622
- No, that's the beauty
of not being married anymore.

15:22.655 --> 15:25.558
I love the clarity
I have right now.

15:25.592 --> 15:27.995
- About what?
About my lateness?

15:27.995 --> 15:29.429
'Cause I know it's annoying,
but it's--

15:29.462 --> 15:31.999
it's not the reason
we got divorced.

15:31.999 --> 15:33.900
- Obviously, but...

15:34.001 --> 15:35.135
you know.

15:35.168 --> 15:36.403
You were always on time
for work,

15:36.436 --> 15:39.472
never missed a flight
or surgery.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.308
Then you'd come home,
and you couldn't manage

15:41.341 --> 15:44.277
to be on time to meet me.

15:44.311 --> 15:45.878
Just saying.

15:48.215 --> 15:50.850
- How about we get
a bottle of wine?

15:50.883 --> 15:51.851
Each.

15:51.884 --> 15:53.920
- I'm not in the mood.

15:54.021 --> 15:55.255
- Okay, I'm getting the feeling

15:55.288 --> 15:57.424
that you want to just
call it a night.

15:57.457 --> 15:58.925
- No.

15:59.026 --> 16:00.860
Actually, I think
I'm in the mood

16:01.028 --> 16:03.196
for a martini.

16:03.230 --> 16:04.431
Dirty.

16:06.033 --> 16:06.933
[tambourine rattling]

16:07.034 --> 16:08.168
- I'm sorry, did someone

16:08.201 --> 16:09.669
just take me to the Lilith Fair?

16:09.702 --> 16:11.338
[tambourine rattling]

16:11.371 --> 16:13.606
- We will engage all
of your senses this evening,

16:13.640 --> 16:15.042
not just with the food

16:15.075 --> 16:17.377
but also with your environment.
Enjoy.

[all snap fingers]

16:19.146 --> 16:21.181
- No bread.

16:21.214 --> 16:22.449
- How did she know
there was bread?

16:22.482 --> 16:24.284
- I'd like to propose a toast

16:24.317 --> 16:25.685
to the love of my life,

16:25.718 --> 16:27.087
Brooke.
- Aww.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.656
- In your eyes,
the light, the heat.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.591
In your eyes, I am complete.

16:31.624 --> 16:33.260
Cheers.
- Cheers.

16:33.293 --> 16:34.627
- A little something I wrote...
- Wow.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.163
- Myself.
- Incredible.

16:36.196 --> 16:38.465
- Cheers.
- Beautiful, honey.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.467
- Here is your first course.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.934
Enjoy.

16:41.968 --> 16:42.935
- Mmm.

16:42.969 --> 16:44.071
It's warm.

16:44.071 --> 16:45.538
I would like to make
my own toast.

16:45.572 --> 16:48.275
- Oh, sorry, I have to
take out my Invisalign.

16:48.308 --> 16:49.609
Sorry, it's so gross.

16:49.642 --> 16:52.112
[muffled]
I usually do this in private,

16:52.145 --> 16:54.081
but you guys can't see me,
so who cares?

16:54.081 --> 16:55.348
Anyway, continue.

16:55.382 --> 16:57.550
- To Jill, who's been
so determined

16:57.584 --> 16:59.419
to jump-start her career.

16:59.452 --> 17:00.487
[egg shaker sounding]

17:00.520 --> 17:02.155
She even came to me--

17:02.189 --> 17:03.690
she was nervous,
I could tell--

17:03.723 --> 17:06.993
to ask if Von Weber
had any openings,

17:07.094 --> 17:10.097
and I imparted to her
my philosophy

17:10.130 --> 17:12.399
about not mixing
work and family.

17:12.432 --> 17:13.466
- I heard it the first time.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.268
- But as Joy Green would say--

17:15.302 --> 17:16.269
[triangle rings]

17:16.303 --> 17:17.537
"Every wise rule

17:17.570 --> 17:19.506
has an even wiser exception,"

17:19.539 --> 17:22.609
so I am offering you a job

17:22.642 --> 17:25.678
to oversee Von Weber's
Instagram account.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.214
- Oh, well, that--
honey, that's a--

17:27.247 --> 17:28.715
- What?
- Yeah.

17:28.748 --> 17:31.451
I want to help you
find your joy, Jill.

17:31.484 --> 17:35.122
I see you struggling,
and it pains me.

17:35.155 --> 17:38.325
- First of all, Brooke,
I'm not "struggling."

17:38.358 --> 17:40.227
I'm actually working
on a project right now

17:40.260 --> 17:41.461
that I'm very excited about.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.563
- This better not be
asparagus tip.

17:43.596 --> 17:45.165
- Yes, so I'm gonna have to

17:45.198 --> 17:48.135
respectfully decline
your generous offer.

17:48.168 --> 17:49.502
- Okay, well,

17:49.536 --> 17:51.304
I was just trying to help.

17:52.639 --> 17:54.141
I won't make that mistake again.

17:54.141 --> 17:55.442
- That's definitely
asparagus tip.

17:55.475 --> 17:56.509
Gross.

17:56.543 --> 17:58.711
- I just thought
it could be fun.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.247
- Really?

18:03.650 --> 18:05.352
Look, Brooke, the reason
that I'm passing

18:05.385 --> 18:06.719
is honestly because of you.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.355
- Yeah, I'm getting
that feeling

18:08.388 --> 18:09.522
loud and clear.
- No, no, no.

18:09.556 --> 18:10.523
That's not what I mean.

18:10.557 --> 18:12.425
I'm saying, you decided

18:12.459 --> 18:13.793
you were gonna be a designer,

18:13.826 --> 18:16.296
and then you did it,
and look at your company.

18:16.329 --> 18:17.397
It's exploded.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.399
- Yeah, I have had
a meteoric rise.

18:19.432 --> 18:22.169
- And I don't want to regret
taking the safe route.

18:22.169 --> 18:24.704
You never do,
and I admire that.

18:24.737 --> 18:27.807
- Please enjoy your next course.

18:31.378 --> 18:32.412

We're all set.
Thanks.

18:34.181 --> 18:35.715
- Jill, thank you.

18:35.748 --> 18:37.184
You're reminding me:

18:37.217 --> 18:39.186
I don't give myself
enough credit.

18:39.186 --> 18:40.853
- [exclaiming]

18:40.887 --> 18:42.522
I taste a little something
hairy in there.

18:42.555 --> 18:43.690
That--mm-mm.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.024
That's--I think that's dill.

18:45.057 --> 18:46.293
Was dill not on my list?

18:46.326 --> 18:47.594
Did the list just
go out the window?

18:47.627 --> 18:48.595
'Cause that was dill.

sensation in my mouth.

18:56.203 --> 18:57.604
and texture?
- [gagging]

18:57.637 --> 18:59.306
- Should we be doing
the Heimlich or something?

18:59.339 --> 19:01.341
- No, I'm pretty sure
if he can make a sound,

19:01.374 --> 19:02.475
he can breathe.

19:03.676 --> 19:04.644
Uh-oh.

- Yes, and my purse,
and my pockets.

Oh, my God, what if I--

what if I ate it?

19:37.677 --> 19:39.145
There was a chewy course.

19:39.246 --> 19:40.880
There was a very chewy course.

19:40.913 --> 19:42.515
It was calamari, right?

- Oh, my God.

of my marbles?

I have forgotten who you are.

Does that count
as break-up sex
