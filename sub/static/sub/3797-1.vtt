01:45.208 --> 01:46.958
Elenore:
"Be honest and true, boys!"

01:46.958 --> 01:49.000
Whatever you do, boys,

01:49.000 --> 01:51.833
"Let this be your motto
through life."

01:51.833 --> 01:54.000
( children shouting )

01:59.333 --> 02:01.416
Elenore:
"Both now and forever,
Be this your endeavor,

02:01.416 --> 02:05.333
When wrong with the right
is at strife.

02:15.375 --> 02:19.083
The best and the truest;
Alas! Are the fewest;

02:19.083 --> 02:21.500
But be one of these
if you can.

02:26.583 --> 02:28.416
In duty, ne'er fail;

02:28.416 --> 02:30.500
You will find
'twill avail you,

02:30.500 --> 02:32.583
And bring its reward
when a man.

02:35.541 --> 02:37.458
Don't think life
plain sailing...

02:38.750 --> 02:40.000
there's danger of failing,

02:40.000 --> 02:43.458
though bright
the futures seem to be...

02:46.833 --> 02:50.083
but bright honor and labor
and truth to your neighbor

02:50.083 --> 02:52.916
"will bear you safe
over life's seas."

02:55.208 --> 02:56.125
- ( applause )
- Commodore! Commodore!

02:56.125 --> 02:59.458
Here, please.
Throw another.

02:59.458 --> 03:02.416
- Mister!
- ( Band playing)

03:07.750 --> 03:10.000
Mr. Commodore.
Throw one to me.

03:17.583 --> 03:19.708
Now commences

03:19.708 --> 03:22.458
our sun-kissed summer,
ladies and gentlemen.

03:22.458 --> 03:25.291
We sprinkle
the sea with gold

03:25.291 --> 03:28.916
and the sea gives it
back to us 100 fold.

03:28.916 --> 03:32.250
That is the glory
of this blessed strand

03:32.250 --> 03:35.875
that we call
Atlantic City.

03:35.875 --> 03:40.208
- ( cheering )

03:40.208 --> 03:43.125
- Throw it! Here!
- Mr. Commodore!

03:43.125 --> 03:45.083
You want some more,
do you? Huh?

03:45.083 --> 03:47.125
( crowd laughs )

03:47.125 --> 03:50.333
- Ah!
- ( Cheering )

03:50.333 --> 03:51.958
- I want to have the money!
- Come on, over here!

03:51.958 --> 03:54.541
( crowd cheering )

03:54.541 --> 03:58.458
Now that's how
you get yourself along.

04:17.041 --> 04:19.250
Boy:
How long was that?

04:19.250 --> 04:21.916
- ( laughing )
- I can hold my breath
longer than you.

04:21.916 --> 04:24.416
- No, you can't.
- Yes, I can.

05:29.250 --> 05:31.500
Where is the goddamn
son of a bitch?

05:31.500 --> 05:33.250
He'll show.

05:33.250 --> 05:35.291
Four days late?

05:35.291 --> 05:38.041
You said you liked Cuba.

05:38.041 --> 05:39.875
What makes you
think I don't?

05:39.875 --> 05:42.708
This conversation.

05:45.250 --> 05:47.666
I just want the deal
to be nailed down.

05:47.666 --> 05:49.708
Trust me or not?

05:49.708 --> 05:51.541
Of course I do.

05:51.541 --> 05:53.958
Then shut up
and dance.

05:53.958 --> 05:56.000
My customers
are watching.

06:18.208 --> 06:20.458
There's your marlin.

08:40.332 --> 08:43.291
Aw, shame she couldn't
join you, Senator.

08:43.291 --> 08:44.916
How's the Presidente?

08:44.916 --> 08:47.291
That's what this is called?
Damn refreshing.

08:47.291 --> 08:48.333
Wait till you try
the one at Bacardi's.

08:48.333 --> 08:51.333
- He'll pour out the...
- Anejo.

08:51.333 --> 08:53.458
You'll see what
the fuss is about.

08:53.458 --> 08:56.125
Well, it's important to learn
the facts on the ground.

08:59.125 --> 09:00.083
What happened
with Wilkerson?

09:00.083 --> 09:02.833
Anything you can share?

09:02.833 --> 09:05.708
The Great Engineer
has backed himself
into a corner.

09:05.708 --> 09:07.583
Wilkerson lays it
all out in the report.

09:07.583 --> 09:09.958
11 years of Volstead

09:09.958 --> 09:12.708
and all they've managed
to achieve is...

09:12.708 --> 09:15.291
you're as aware
as anyone.

09:15.291 --> 09:17.125
Good intentions.

09:17.125 --> 09:18.916
Unenforceable law.

09:19.916 --> 09:22.833
- Ah.
- A Presidente for you.

09:24.208 --> 09:25.333
It's all on the house.

09:29.250 --> 09:31.583
Ah.

09:31.583 --> 09:34.666
25 billion up in smoke
since the crash.

09:34.666 --> 09:37.041
16% unemployment.

09:37.041 --> 09:40.416
900 million a year
in liquor taxes

09:40.416 --> 09:41.916
and licenses
the government
isn't getting.

09:41.916 --> 09:46.041
You ask me,
the whole damn country
could use a drink.

09:46.041 --> 09:48.000
- ( laughs )
- Will Hoover advocate repeal?

09:48.000 --> 09:51.958
He rode in with the drys,
he'll have to ride out
with them.

09:51.958 --> 09:53.291
You think he will?

09:53.291 --> 09:55.500
Will he what?
Run in '32?

09:55.500 --> 09:57.250
Do you think he'll lose?

09:59.625 --> 10:01.291
This is all just
exploratory, understood?

10:03.833 --> 10:06.500
Constitutional amendments
don't get overturned.

10:06.500 --> 10:09.625
You have friends
who believe otherwise.

10:09.625 --> 10:12.291
Men like that tend
to get what they want.

10:12.291 --> 10:13.583
You said it yourself,

10:13.583 --> 10:16.666
good for the country,
good for you and me.

10:19.250 --> 10:20.250
He doesn't talk much.

10:20.250 --> 10:23.916
That's what I like
about him.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.333
Let's just be clear.

10:27.333 --> 10:29.291
Certain issues
regarding your past

10:29.291 --> 10:32.666
make moving
forward tricky.

10:32.666 --> 10:35.500
I'm not sure
what you mean.

10:35.500 --> 10:38.666
Do I have
to spell it out?

10:38.666 --> 10:41.541
Your hands
aren't the cleanest.

10:41.541 --> 10:44.958
I won't lie.
I have been arrested
and convicted.

10:44.958 --> 10:48.000
1923, I bought
a pint of Old Granddad

10:48.000 --> 10:50.291
in Union Station
in Washington DC.

10:50.291 --> 10:52.416
I paid a $5 fine

10:52.416 --> 10:54.333
and I spent
the night in jail.

10:54.333 --> 10:55.875
It's haunted me
ever since.

10:55.875 --> 10:58.208
Wendell, if America's
not about starting over,

10:58.208 --> 11:01.333
where's the hope
for any of us?

11:03.625 --> 11:06.166
Senator, I hear you're a bit
of an expert on foreign trade.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.125
I'm on the Senate
subcommittee.

11:08.125 --> 11:12.500
Well, that young lady,

11:12.500 --> 11:15.291
she is very interested
in the subject.

11:15.291 --> 11:17.375
Would you be willing to share
some of your experience?

11:22.791 --> 11:25.041
( chuckles )

11:28.791 --> 11:30.958
( music playing )

11:47.625 --> 11:50.000
( jackhammering continues )

11:57.666 --> 12:00.666
Who knows

12:00.666 --> 12:02.833
what I did
last night?

12:02.833 --> 12:05.000
Anybody?

12:08.041 --> 12:08.666
Miss Rohan?

12:08.666 --> 12:12.500
Did I...

12:12.500 --> 12:15.500
mention anything
to you?

12:15.500 --> 12:18.958
I believe you intended to see
a "fillum," Mr. Bennett.

12:18.958 --> 12:20.833
That's exactly right.

12:20.833 --> 12:22.291
I went to a "fillum,"

12:22.291 --> 12:24.958
as you charmingly
pronounce it,

12:24.958 --> 12:27.541
with my beloved
spouse Laura,

12:27.541 --> 12:30.500
the mother
of my children,

12:30.500 --> 12:32.750
because life is not just
about dollars and cents.

12:32.750 --> 12:35.333
Is it?

12:35.333 --> 12:37.875
No, sir.

12:37.875 --> 12:39.458
Saw "The Front Page."

12:39.458 --> 12:43.125
Lively comedy about
the newspaper game.

12:43.125 --> 12:44.916
Enjoyed it tremendously.

12:44.916 --> 12:46.625
The cartoon beforehand...

12:46.625 --> 12:51.666
Mickey Mouse cast away
on a desert island.

12:51.666 --> 12:54.958
Just imagine the hijinks
that little...

12:54.958 --> 12:57.166
anyone seen it?

12:57.166 --> 12:59.083
Then you know
what I'm talking about.

12:59.083 --> 13:02.583
Gorilla, dancing seals,
baby tiger.

13:02.583 --> 13:05.166
At one point,
Mickey finds a piano...

13:07.291 --> 13:09.416
not important.

13:09.416 --> 13:11.166
What is important...

13:11.166 --> 13:14.125
he doesn't give up.

13:14.125 --> 13:17.166
He makes the best
of the situation.
He stays cheerful.

13:17.166 --> 13:19.625
And in the end...

13:19.625 --> 13:22.041
what happens in the end?

13:22.041 --> 13:24.250
He sails away
on a turtle?

13:24.250 --> 13:26.000
Sails away
on a turtle!

13:26.000 --> 13:29.291
You see, friends?

13:29.291 --> 13:32.250
Don't let the naysayers
get you down.

13:32.250 --> 13:35.125
The country is strong.
The market is strong.

13:35.125 --> 13:37.458
Conors & Gould
is strong.

13:38.625 --> 13:41.625
It is a grand time
to make some money.

13:46.875 --> 13:49.291
( all gasp )

13:49.291 --> 13:50.375
Oh, no, no.
Everything's gonna
work out fine.

13:50.375 --> 13:53.916
- ( gunshot )
- ( Screaming )

13:53.916 --> 13:57.458
( train whistle blowing )

13:57.458 --> 14:00.375
( train clacking )

14:06.125 --> 14:08.166
Fix this?

14:10.708 --> 14:13.583
Cross
and cross again.

14:14.541 --> 14:18.750
See? It's called
a reef knot.

14:18.750 --> 14:20.500
You try.

14:20.500 --> 14:23.041
Cross and cross again.

14:23.041 --> 14:23.625
They inside?

14:23.625 --> 14:26.666
Yeah.

14:26.666 --> 14:28.666
She's real hot.

14:28.666 --> 14:30.791
You can feel it.

14:30.791 --> 14:31.916
Where is he?

14:31.916 --> 14:34.583
On the bay.

14:36.375 --> 14:37.833
Leave that.

14:37.833 --> 14:39.875
Come on, now.

14:39.875 --> 14:40.916
Eli.

14:40.916 --> 14:44.625
Mom might need us.

14:44.625 --> 14:46.541
( ticking )

14:49.125 --> 14:50.833
Close the door.

15:02.041 --> 15:04.458
( coughs )

15:07.458 --> 15:10.625
Elenore:
What were the ladies wearing?

15:10.625 --> 15:14.125
One was in a sort
of yellow bonnet

15:14.125 --> 15:16.250
and green skirt

15:16.250 --> 15:18.958
and green jacket
about to here.

15:18.958 --> 15:21.208
It's called a bask.

15:21.208 --> 15:23.291
Did you eat
something, Enoch?

15:23.291 --> 15:25.541
Yes.
There was a swell.

15:25.541 --> 15:27.958
He was off to the station
so I carried his bags.

15:27.958 --> 15:29.500
He bought me oysters.

15:29.500 --> 15:31.750
There's cold bread
and molasses.

15:31.750 --> 15:32.916
I had the oysters, Ma.

15:32.916 --> 15:36.291
Well, here's something
you don't have.

15:41.291 --> 15:42.833
Someone was
throwing it away.

15:42.833 --> 15:45.375
It's full
of interesting things.

15:45.375 --> 15:47.291
( door opens )

16:08.083 --> 16:11.125
Your man was up
to his tricks today,
wasn't he?

16:11.125 --> 16:11.958
Sir?

16:11.958 --> 16:14.833
Your Commodore.

16:14.833 --> 16:16.958
With his pockets
full of gold.

16:16.958 --> 16:18.541
He opened the sea.

16:18.541 --> 16:20.666
Does he own
that, too, now?

16:20.666 --> 16:21.875
Just for the city people.

16:21.875 --> 16:24.208
Gold in the water.

16:24.208 --> 16:26.958
All the little
fishies biting.

16:33.625 --> 16:36.000
Go on.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.416
So what did
you catch, hmm?

16:38.416 --> 16:40.791
You catch some gold,
little fish?

16:40.791 --> 16:42.208
No, sir.

16:42.208 --> 16:43.750
Why not?

16:45.291 --> 16:46.833
I wasn't quick enough.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.125
My boots is
drying on the porch.
Go check them.

16:58.125 --> 17:02.791
( door opens, closes )

17:04.458 --> 17:08.083
It took your mother
three days to birth you.

17:08.083 --> 17:10.915
I was out on the water.

17:10.915 --> 17:15.208
I didn't know if I was
a father or a widower.

17:16.958 --> 17:21.000
I come home,
she was in bed
with her hair down.

17:22.665 --> 17:23.250
Her beautiful hair.

17:25.875 --> 17:27.915
A boy in her arms.

17:28.916 --> 17:30.291
My boy.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.083
( grunts )

17:36.083 --> 17:37.250
You're the son
of a fisherman.

17:37.250 --> 17:40.958
And what are you
trying to catch?

17:40.958 --> 17:43.250
( girl coughing )

17:56.958 --> 17:59.041
Finish that.

18:03.541 --> 18:06.708
( music playing )

18:08.958 --> 18:10.291
( Sally speaking Spanish )

18:13.041 --> 18:16.958
( speaking Spanish )

18:16.958 --> 18:18.916
The goddamn hell
is this guy?

18:18.916 --> 18:20.750
He's your senator.

18:20.750 --> 18:22.125
It's a three-hour drive.

18:22.125 --> 18:23.916
( speaking Spanish )

18:23.916 --> 18:25.500
Nothing happens
on time here.

18:25.500 --> 18:27.166
It's not the clocks
in Cuba I'm worried about.

18:27.166 --> 18:29.750
- ( speaks Spanish )
- Hey, kid, please.

18:36.708 --> 18:38.041
Here, you pick 'em.

18:38.041 --> 18:40.041
I give you
the good ones.

18:44.250 --> 18:45.500
That's my lucky number.

18:45.500 --> 18:48.875
You heard Lloyd.
They need the revenue.

18:48.875 --> 18:51.666
I want everything set up
and ready the day the vote
comes down

18:51.666 --> 18:53.416
so I can be
in there first.

18:53.416 --> 18:55.791
Let's say you are.

18:55.791 --> 18:59.375
Then, whatever anyone thinks,
whatever they claim I've done,

18:59.375 --> 19:00.208
I'm clean.

19:03.041 --> 19:04.208
What?

19:05.500 --> 19:06.416
( men shouting in Spanish )

19:10.541 --> 19:12.250
Man:
What is going on
over there?

19:15.583 --> 19:18.291
( whistle blowing )

19:18.291 --> 19:21.916
- What are they saying?
- Anti-Machado stuff.

19:21.916 --> 19:24.000
( shouting in Spanish )

19:29.125 --> 19:31.000
Another day
in paradise.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.625
Always complaining
about something.

19:33.625 --> 19:35.250
Might wind up
doing more than that.

19:38.708 --> 19:39.875
Meyer.

19:39.875 --> 19:43.208
Nucky.
Hello.

19:44.750 --> 19:45.791
And Miss Wheet.

19:47.666 --> 19:48.875
Been a while.

19:48.875 --> 19:51.166
- A.R.'s funeral.
- A sad day.

19:51.166 --> 19:53.750
- Rest his soul.
- What brings you here?

19:55.458 --> 19:57.083
Wife's been hocking me
for a holiday.

19:57.083 --> 20:00.041
- Married?
- Married.

20:00.041 --> 20:03.208
A son.
Makes you concentrate
on the future.

20:05.791 --> 20:08.250
( speaking Spanish )

20:09.541 --> 20:12.000
- We should all...
- We should.

20:16.500 --> 20:19.625
Meyer.

20:19.625 --> 20:20.500
My best to Charlie.

20:20.500 --> 20:22.750
We don't talk
too often.

20:23.958 --> 20:25.875
One of us is still
a bachelor.

20:32.916 --> 20:35.041
What's his story?

20:35.041 --> 20:36.416
Man on vacation.

20:39.750 --> 20:41.791
Just like you.

20:41.791 --> 20:44.250
Morning, folks.

20:44.250 --> 20:46.291
It is still morning,
isn't it?

20:46.291 --> 20:49.208
Wendell,
where have you been?

20:49.208 --> 20:51.791
Tell the truth,
I'm not exactly sure.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.250
( foghorn blows )

20:57.833 --> 21:00.625
( laughing )

21:00.625 --> 21:03.208
Man: I remember
that last time.

21:03.208 --> 21:05.416
- Woman: We were there.
- Man: He was the life
of the party.

21:05.416 --> 21:08.666
- I don't know.
- Right you are.

21:09.875 --> 21:11.791
Come on.
Come on.

21:11.791 --> 21:13.208
Move over.

21:13.208 --> 21:14.625
Come on, I don't
have enough space.

21:14.625 --> 21:15.875
- Yes, you do.
- No.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.916
- You're crowding me.
- There's room enough.

21:18.916 --> 21:20.083
- Stop.
- Get away.

21:20.083 --> 21:21.875
Play fair,
why don't you, Jim?

21:21.875 --> 21:23.583
I ain't playing.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.000
- Here they come.
- Shh. Come on.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.416
( laughing, chatting )

21:31.375 --> 21:33.375
- Whoa!
- Come on! Come on!
Come on!

21:36.458 --> 21:39.791
- There's one over there!
- I got that one!

21:39.791 --> 21:42.125
- Come on! Come on!
- ( Boys laughing )

21:42.125 --> 21:44.416
- Oh, I got another one!
- I got one!

21:45.500 --> 21:47.250
Yes, I got a second one!

21:47.250 --> 21:50.416
Man: Thank you.
Here, for you.

21:50.416 --> 21:52.291
Got your skimmers,
misters.

21:52.291 --> 21:53.833
Can you beat that?
The blue band's mine.

21:53.833 --> 21:55.833
- That one's
mine right there.
- It's a fine one.

21:55.833 --> 21:57.625
- Sir, is this yours?
- Give him something, Jake.

21:57.625 --> 21:59.583
- Boy: 10 cents
will do it, sir.
- Man: You little pirate.

21:59.583 --> 22:01.083
- Boy ♪2: Is this yours?
- Man ♪2: Hey, where's mine?

22:01.083 --> 22:02.916

22:02.916 --> 22:04.541
- Where is it?
- Thank you so much.

22:04.541 --> 22:06.750
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Here he comes.

22:06.750 --> 22:08.583
- Very nice.
- Thank you.

22:08.583 --> 22:10.666
20 cents.

22:10.666 --> 22:11.791
I don't have it.

22:11.791 --> 22:14.916
Go look.

22:18.833 --> 22:21.583
You just hide here
and pray for wind?

22:21.583 --> 22:24.916
No, it generally blows up
in the afternoon.

22:26.125 --> 22:27.791
Ah.

22:30.583 --> 22:32.791
Take one.

22:32.791 --> 22:34.916
Hell, take two.

22:35.958 --> 22:37.958
Man: Hey, Pat.
Are you coming?

Work it up, now.

count that high, Milton.

23:39.708 --> 23:41.333
10 fingers, 10 toes.

23:41.333 --> 23:43.916
How much that is?

23:43.916 --> 23:46.375
Don't worry yourself.

23:46.375 --> 23:48.791
Some water maybe?

23:52.416 --> 23:53.625
Bucket.

23:58.791 --> 24:01.458
How'd you get
that dent in your head?

24:03.208 --> 24:06.000
Well, Hoss,
I wasn't but nine

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
and Pappy say, "Milton",

24:09.000 --> 24:11.500
you know what that is?

24:11.500 --> 24:13.375
That's an ass backwards.

24:13.375 --> 24:16.541
"Ass like that do
everything in reverse."

24:16.541 --> 24:19.875

So I go to ride him.

24:19.875 --> 24:22.791
Climb up on that rump,

You ate oysters.

Says who?

25:54.833 --> 25:56.750
Did you?

25:58.291 --> 25:59.458
I can see you there.

25:59.458 --> 26:04.458
With all the swells.
Like you belonged.

26:05.916 --> 26:08.750
They're not so special.

26:10.375 --> 26:12.500
All they have is money.

26:12.500 --> 26:13.708
Ways to find that,
I reckon.

26:13.708 --> 26:16.333
How?

26:21.958 --> 26:23.291
Get yourself
there first.

26:28.375 --> 26:30.458
Give me your hand, Sue.

He wants to see you.

28:43.291 --> 28:44.291
How are you feeling?

28:46.958 --> 28:47.333
Sir?

28:50.166 --> 28:52.333
How do you feel?

28:55.083 --> 28:57.916
I... shocked?

28:59.833 --> 29:01.333
And saddened.

29:04.500 --> 29:07.875
- Concerned.
- We are all concerned.

29:07.875 --> 29:10.000
All very concerned.

29:12.333 --> 29:15.666
What did you do
for Mr. Bennett?

29:15.666 --> 29:18.833
Managed his appointments.

29:18.833 --> 29:21.708
Made sure trade orders
were promptly filed.

29:21.708 --> 29:23.458
That's all?

29:23.458 --> 29:26.333
I sometimes ran errands
for Mrs. Bennett.

29:26.333 --> 29:29.041
Shopping and the like.

29:29.041 --> 29:31.583
Mr. Bennett assured me
secretaries were expected

29:31.583 --> 29:33.666
to carry out duties
of that nature.

29:35.958 --> 29:38.583
Was that improper?

29:38.583 --> 29:40.375
I've been at this 40 years.
Boom and bust.

29:42.708 --> 29:45.208
You can always
make money on the street

29:45.208 --> 29:47.750
as long as you don't
get yourself turned around.

29:47.750 --> 29:49.541
Hmm?

29:49.541 --> 29:51.250
Don't get turned around.

29:54.291 --> 29:56.041
Not married?

29:56.041 --> 29:58.791
No, Mr. Conors.

29:58.791 --> 30:00.666
Family?

30:00.666 --> 30:02.625
Brother and sisters.

30:02.625 --> 30:04.583
Time you found
a husband.

30:05.916 --> 30:08.208
Am I to be let go?

30:10.750 --> 30:12.375
Do you know where
he kept the key

30:12.375 --> 30:14.375
to the file cabinet
in his office?

30:14.375 --> 30:17.000
No.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.291
We need to open
the file cabinet.

30:20.333 --> 30:22.333
I don't know
where he kept it.

30:22.333 --> 30:25.000
Call a locksmith.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.916
Have him open it.

30:29.083 --> 30:30.791
Did I ask how you feel?

30:30.791 --> 30:33.583
You did.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.750
Good.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.625
Thank you, brother.

30:43.958 --> 30:45.875
What you doing now?

30:47.291 --> 30:49.166
Fixing up
that boot, huh?

30:49.166 --> 30:51.208
Yeah, that's smart.

30:51.208 --> 30:53.250
Feet ain't right,
everything go slipways.
Yes, sir.

30:55.750 --> 31:00.583
These here?
I sneak some grease
off from the cook.

31:00.583 --> 31:04.125
Rub it all in,
keep it real soft.

31:04.125 --> 31:07.583
Hole right here, though.
That ain't much.

31:11.500 --> 31:14.500
Don't you never
want to say nothing?

31:20.083 --> 31:21.416
What you done
in the first place?

31:22.833 --> 31:26.125
Got myself caught.

31:26.125 --> 31:28.833
You sure do
weave a tale.

31:30.916 --> 31:33.333
I stove my pappy's
head in is what.

31:33.333 --> 31:35.750
'Cause I wouldn't stand
for them tricks he pulled
on me no more.

31:35.750 --> 31:38.166
Yes, sir.

31:40.166 --> 31:44.500
♪ Who been here
since I been gone? ♪

31:44.500 --> 31:48.416
♪ Pretty little gal

31:50.333 --> 31:52.875
Hog eye!
( laughs )

31:53.583 --> 31:55.625
( whistles blows )

31:55.625 --> 31:57.666
Guard:
Work it up. Work it up.
Work it up.

31:57.666 --> 32:00.166
Let's go, stripey.

32:00.166 --> 32:02.708
I said let's go.

32:02.708 --> 32:05.291
Always the last one
sitting.

32:09.541 --> 32:11.875
- Guard: This is a work crew.
- I'll give you some, boy.

32:11.875 --> 32:13.166
If you don't like the work,
there's the box.

32:13.166 --> 32:16.458
I don't care!
I don't care!

32:16.458 --> 32:18.125
Fuck every motherfucking
one of y'all.

32:18.125 --> 32:21.125
- ( shouts )
- ( Groans )

32:21.125 --> 32:22.291
- ( gunshot )
- ( Whistle blowing )

32:25.625 --> 32:27.291
- ( groans )
- ( Dog barking )

32:27.291 --> 32:30.208
- ( gunshot )
- ( Grunts )

32:30.208 --> 32:33.333
- ( whistle blowing )
- Get up, mutt!

32:33.333 --> 32:34.958
( gunshot )

32:37.333 --> 32:39.458
( gunshots )

32:50.791 --> 32:53.000
( men shouting )

32:53.000 --> 32:54.541
( gunshot )

32:54.541 --> 32:56.000
( whistle blowing )

32:56.000 --> 32:58.291
( panting )

33:08.916 --> 33:10.625
You ever talk
on a telephone?

33:13.083 --> 33:14.333
Huh?

33:14.333 --> 33:15.416
( gun hammer clicks )

33:16.958 --> 33:20.833
You ever talk on one?

33:24.125 --> 33:28.041
How they fit
a body's voice

33:28.041 --> 33:30.208
inside that little box?

33:32.000 --> 33:33.708
Electricity.

33:38.791 --> 33:41.500
Money in a house
outside Thurmont.

33:41.500 --> 33:43.708
Split it with you.

33:43.708 --> 33:47.041
You handle all
the telephones and such.

34:00.541 --> 34:04.041
Ronis:
Don Facundo came here
from Catalonia.

34:04.041 --> 34:05.333
Before that, there was
nothing worth drinking.

34:05.333 --> 34:08.875
But today, when you
think of Cuba,

34:08.875 --> 34:10.416
you think of rum.

34:10.416 --> 34:11.833
When you think of rum...

34:11.833 --> 34:13.833
( speaks Spanish )

34:17.166 --> 34:19.125
How did you wind up running
the company, Mr. Ronis?

34:19.125 --> 34:20.916
Married
the boss's daughter.

34:20.916 --> 34:23.583
Well, lucky girl.

34:23.583 --> 34:26.041
Très gentille, Miss Wheet.

34:27.750 --> 34:29.708
And your market?

34:29.708 --> 34:32.041
Latin America.
Europe.

34:32.041 --> 34:34.083
Next month we open
a plant in Mexico.

34:34.083 --> 34:36.250
Sounds like
something's missing.

34:36.250 --> 34:40.583
It is no secret.
We would like Bacardi again
for sale in the States.

34:40.583 --> 34:43.916
Mmm, and I'd like
to be the man to sell it.

34:43.916 --> 34:46.750
Not possible, though.
Legally.

34:46.750 --> 34:49.125
Not today.
But that's going
to change.

34:50.041 --> 34:52.083
Is it so,
Senator Lloyd?

34:52.083 --> 34:55.333
Well, America is
a mighty vessel, sir.

34:55.333 --> 34:58.208
- It's not easily turned.
- However...

34:58.208 --> 35:01.500
The political capital
needed to effect a change
of such sweeping...

35:01.500 --> 35:03.833
However,
your informed opinion...

35:06.375 --> 35:09.666
- I don't recall precisely...
- Of course you do.

35:09.666 --> 35:11.375
It was you, me, Sally,

35:11.375 --> 35:14.125
and what was
the señorita's name?

35:14.125 --> 35:17.125
She was paying particularly
close attention.

35:18.791 --> 35:20.583
Speaking privately
among friends,

35:20.583 --> 35:22.958
the country is ready
to move forward.

35:22.958 --> 35:25.375
And that
is an opportunity.

35:25.375 --> 35:29.000
Don Maxime, I have
a distribution network
already in place.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.208
Deepwater port
on the Florida coast.

35:31.208 --> 35:33.250
Agreements with rail lines
and trucking companies.

35:33.250 --> 35:37.250
The day repeal passes,
I intend to be open
for business legally

35:37.250 --> 35:39.708
in the thirstiest
country on Earth

35:39.708 --> 35:44.208
with Bacardi Rum
as my most exclusive
offering.

35:44.208 --> 35:46.958
Can the two of us
come to an arrangement?

35:48.416 --> 35:49.916
A bodyguard?

35:51.083 --> 35:52.416
Is that a problem?

35:52.416 --> 35:54.250
No. I have
several myself.

35:54.250 --> 35:57.833
Cuba today
is not so safe.

35:57.833 --> 35:59.458
So build a plant
in Mexico.

35:59.458 --> 36:03.375
Well, it's always wise
to have an exit arranged.

36:04.875 --> 36:08.083
A man like yourself

36:08.083 --> 36:10.166
would understand that.

36:19.041 --> 36:20.416
( people chatting )

36:58.250 --> 37:00.458
I found the key.

37:01.791 --> 37:05.041
I come, 16 year old.

37:05.041 --> 37:07.125
I don't got nothing.

37:07.125 --> 37:10.291
Don't ask for nothing.

37:10.291 --> 37:12.208
You pulled
yourself up, Joe.

37:12.208 --> 37:15.708
Ah, I have to fight.

37:15.708 --> 37:18.250
What choice
they give me?

37:18.250 --> 37:20.666
Every day a fight.

37:20.666 --> 37:24.666
But one man,
one boss.

37:24.666 --> 37:27.000
I don't work
no other way.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
Maranzano's got
the same idea.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.458
( speaks Italian )

37:30.458 --> 37:32.500
He's playing us for saps.

37:32.500 --> 37:34.500
Oh.

37:34.500 --> 37:38.000
You don't take
what someone else build.

37:42.166 --> 37:43.416
And me...

37:47.750 --> 37:49.416
Understand?

37:49.416 --> 37:51.125
So give me the word
and we'll end it.

37:51.125 --> 37:55.458
You fix
all my trouble, huh?

37:55.458 --> 37:58.125
- It's my trouble, too.
- And what do you do,
then, huh?

37:58.125 --> 38:00.666
After you fix?

38:00.666 --> 38:03.166
( phone ringing )

38:06.000 --> 38:08.333
Why do you
have to say that?

38:08.333 --> 38:09.333
Ain't I been loyal?

38:09.333 --> 38:13.833
All this time,
I stuck with you.

38:13.833 --> 38:16.000
Huh?
I'm here with you.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.583
How you take care of it?

38:22.000 --> 38:23.958
Just leave that to me.

38:26.583 --> 38:28.833
What you don't know,
you can't get nailed for.

38:28.833 --> 38:31.250
( hangs up phone )

38:35.541 --> 38:37.791
Joe.

38:37.791 --> 38:39.000
How much more
you want to lose?

38:39.000 --> 38:42.250
( speaks Italian )

38:42.250 --> 38:43.208
One boss.

38:49.916 --> 38:52.708
( phone ringing )

39:02.125 --> 39:04.166
We gonna sit here
all day?

39:04.166 --> 39:05.708
Where you got to go?

39:05.708 --> 39:08.500
The head.
Five espresso.

39:08.500 --> 39:11.375
Do what you need to.

39:27.208 --> 39:28.875
Tonino:
How you doing, boss?

39:28.875 --> 39:31.791
( Joe speaking Yiddish )

39:33.333 --> 39:35.166
Tonino:
Charlie here?

39:35.166 --> 39:38.375
( conversation continues
indistinctly )

39:38.375 --> 39:40.333
- ( man shouts in Italian )
- ( Gunshots )

39:46.625 --> 39:49.541
( shells clatter )

39:49.541 --> 39:52.333
- What the fuck took so long?
- Traffic the whole way.

39:52.333 --> 39:54.500
Had to be done, right?

39:56.875 --> 39:59.250
( speaks Italian )

40:02.500 --> 40:05.833
♪ We hurry to my ♪

40:05.833 --> 40:11.041

40:31.750 --> 40:34.375
( boys chatting )

40:37.708 --> 40:40.416
- Get! Go on!
- ( Boys screaming )

40:42.208 --> 40:45.708
( laughing )
Yeah.

40:48.875 --> 40:51.041
Halligan:
A man needs to get out
of town every now and then.

40:51.041 --> 40:53.500
Commodore:
That's just the glory
of the whole proposition.

40:53.500 --> 40:56.708
Halligan:
They have beaches
in Brooklyn.

40:56.708 --> 40:59.250
Right opportunity, Pat.
Can't you see it?

40:59.250 --> 41:01.833
Then why don't you
do it yourself?

41:01.833 --> 41:03.750
I need
the New York money.

41:03.750 --> 41:06.291
Just think, rail line
straight down from
the Jersey crossing.

41:06.291 --> 41:08.375
Stopping where?
On your doorstep?

41:08.375 --> 41:11.083
It's Atlantic City
I care about.

41:11.083 --> 41:12.250
I aim to build
something great here

41:12.250 --> 41:14.666
and those
who join with me...

41:14.666 --> 41:17.125
- You was warned once.
- No, I wasn't.

41:17.125 --> 41:18.458
Bunch of wharf rats,
the lot of you.

41:18.458 --> 41:19.250
Clear out, now.
Let's go.

41:19.250 --> 41:21.583
What's the ruckus, Jacob?

41:21.583 --> 41:24.000
Jacob:
I told them
no congregating.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.458
Sheriff's meant
to be obeyed, boy.

41:26.458 --> 41:28.916
This is his.

41:29.833 --> 41:31.666
( laughs )

41:31.666 --> 41:34.500
( grunts )

41:34.500 --> 41:36.583
Well?

41:46.458 --> 41:47.208
Here you go.

41:49.083 --> 41:50.666
Sir?

41:50.666 --> 41:53.375
Found my hat,
didn't you?

41:53.958 --> 41:56.250
It's too much.

41:57.791 --> 41:59.583
Compared to what?

42:00.958 --> 42:01.708
Did you know
that money was there?

42:01.708 --> 42:04.416
Yes, sir.

42:04.416 --> 42:06.250
Then why didn't
you take it?

42:06.250 --> 42:07.250
Answer true.

42:10.833 --> 42:13.083
To get myself ahead.

42:17.166 --> 42:19.166
No boys on the porch.

42:22.125 --> 42:23.416
Scram.

42:23.416 --> 42:25.166
Man:
Charlie, steady
this ladder for me.

42:25.166 --> 42:28.083
Charlie:
All right.
Hold on.

42:28.958 --> 42:30.708
That good for you?

42:30.708 --> 42:33.666
( music playing )

42:36.291 --> 42:38.333
( speaking Spanish )

42:51.375 --> 42:53.291
( speaking Spanish )

42:54.833 --> 42:56.291
Freshen up.
Come down to the bar.

42:56.291 --> 42:58.750
You'll have lots
of admirers waiting.

42:58.750 --> 43:00.958
You're quite
a slave driver.

43:00.958 --> 43:03.250
Pin a note on you
this time so you
don't get lost.

43:03.250 --> 43:05.458
( laughs )
Well, oh, my.

43:05.458 --> 43:07.416
Can we talk
for a moment?

43:09.125 --> 43:10.375
- I need to get cigarettes.
- See you boys inside.

43:12.541 --> 43:14.083
Let's get
something straight.

43:14.083 --> 43:16.583
I'm not
your whipping boy.

43:16.583 --> 43:19.833
And I'm not here
to get tarred with
someone else's brush.

43:19.833 --> 43:22.416
Whatever happens
with Volstead,

43:22.416 --> 43:23.666
- whatever happens
between us...
- Lucky Strikes.

43:23.666 --> 43:26.583
I won't
make guarantees
about legislation

43:26.583 --> 43:28.875
nobody can...

43:28.875 --> 43:30.583
I won't get bitten
in the ass.

43:30.583 --> 43:33.166
- ( speaking Spanish )
- Are you listening to me?

43:33.166 --> 43:33.916
What happened to the ones
I already bought?

43:33.916 --> 43:36.500
Those were shit.

43:36.500 --> 43:37.916
I give you good
number for tomorrow.

43:37.916 --> 43:39.958
I've had that seat
for 20 years.

43:39.958 --> 43:41.666
- And one night
in some dago cathouse...
- How much for the whole book?

43:41.666 --> 43:44.083
- ...doesn't buy you
the right to treat me...
- ( Speaking Spanish )

43:44.083 --> 43:46.333
like some kind
of senate page boy.

43:46.333 --> 43:50.666
- You first.
- You think you're the only one
who comes knocking on my door?

43:50.666 --> 43:52.250
See? This is how
we do business.

43:52.250 --> 43:53.750
There are plenty
of fellas with cleaner
fingernails than you.

43:53.750 --> 43:56.333
Socio, watch out!

43:56.333 --> 43:57.416
- ( women screaming )
- Man: Watch out!

44:07.708 --> 44:08.750
Man:
If don't get out of here...

44:08.750 --> 44:12.125
( groaning )

44:24.500 --> 44:26.625
- ( cracks )
- ( Groans )

44:28.791 --> 44:30.625
( woman screams )

44:53.833 --> 44:55.250
( whistle blowing )

45:00.750 --> 45:02.208
( applause )

45:08.125 --> 45:09.416
( men speaking Italian )

45:11.791 --> 45:13.333
There you go.

45:25.208 --> 45:28.125
Amici. Amici.

45:29.958 --> 45:32.625
What do we come
to celebrate?

45:32.625 --> 45:35.250
20 pills in
Joe Masseria's gut.

45:35.250 --> 45:36.750
- ( laughing )
- ( Applause )

45:36.750 --> 45:39.125
Salute!

45:39.125 --> 45:40.791
Kingdoms rise,

45:40.791 --> 45:43.000
kingdoms fall.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.333
Pretenders reach
for the throne,

45:45.333 --> 45:48.250
but only Caesar can rule.

45:49.916 --> 45:53.666
And the pretenders
fade away.

45:55.583 --> 45:57.250
What does it all mean?

45:58.666 --> 46:00.041
In the words
of Marcus Aurelius,

46:00.041 --> 46:03.916
"The universe is change.

46:03.916 --> 46:06.208
Our life is what
our thoughts make it."

46:09.958 --> 46:12.500
And my thoughts

46:12.500 --> 46:13.291
are these.

46:15.916 --> 46:18.166
Everybody in this room...

46:19.708 --> 46:21.833
is going to get rich!

46:21.833 --> 46:23.500
( cheering )

46:31.208 --> 46:34.541
A new friend
is here tonight.

46:36.041 --> 46:36.875
A son of Sicily.

46:36.875 --> 46:39.916
A son of America.

46:41.125 --> 46:42.375
We owe him much.

46:44.833 --> 46:46.583
Come forward.

46:46.583 --> 46:48.500
( speaks Italian )

46:50.333 --> 46:51.250
- Man: Let him through.
- ( Men murmuring )

47:07.833 --> 47:10.000
The hero.

47:18.125 --> 47:20.375
Don Salvatore.

47:48.833 --> 47:50.291
( speaking Italian )

48:18.125 --> 48:19.500
( speaks Italian )

48:19.500 --> 48:21.500
( music playing )

48:30.625 --> 48:32.458
( speaks Italian )

48:34.916 --> 48:36.833
( speaks Italian )

48:38.958 --> 48:41.791
( speaks Italian )

48:50.125 --> 48:51.833
( speaking Spanish )

48:51.833 --> 48:54.666
He says...
he says these people

48:54.666 --> 48:56.000
are thieves,
criminals.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.291
Enemies of Cuba.

48:58.291 --> 49:01.333
They want something
for nothing.

49:01.333 --> 49:03.625
They steal, they rob.

49:05.750 --> 49:10.125
A rich American
on the street,
an opportunity.

49:14.208 --> 49:17.875
He says there are
formalities

49:17.875 --> 49:18.750
concerning the incident.

49:18.750 --> 49:22.333
How much

49:22.333 --> 49:24.208
to keep it quiet?

49:29.625 --> 49:31.375
200.

49:43.125 --> 49:44.541
Boy:
Hey, fellas,
they're here.

49:44.541 --> 49:46.541
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

49:46.541 --> 49:49.000
- Move out of my way!
- No, you. Beat it.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.750
- Me! Me!
- Hey, lady!

49:50.750 --> 49:52.750
- Help you with your bags?
- We're here to help, ma'am.

49:52.750 --> 49:55.083
- May I help you?
- Don't want to get sand
in your pretty slippers.

49:55.083 --> 49:56.291
Take my hand, ma'am.
I'll help you.

49:56.291 --> 49:57.958
I should be helping you.

49:57.958 --> 49:58.833
I've got you, ma'am.
Watch your step.

49:58.833 --> 50:01.500
There you go.

50:01.500 --> 50:04.291
- Welcome to Atlantic City.
- You're quite the gentleman.

50:06.833 --> 50:08.833
Thank you, young man.

50:08.833 --> 50:10.750
Here you are.

50:13.291 --> 50:15.458
- ( hums )
- ( Boys laugh )

50:15.458 --> 50:18.708
- You look just like her.
- No, his butt is bigger.

50:18.708 --> 50:20.791
- Yes.
- ( Laughing )

50:22.708 --> 50:24.666
Get off.

50:24.666 --> 50:27.041
- ( boys shouting )
- Get him! Beat him!
Get him! Get him!

50:27.041 --> 50:28.833
- Woman: Stop it!
- Ain't fair!

50:28.833 --> 50:31.916
- Woman:
Boys, stop doing that.
- Ain't fair!

50:31.916 --> 50:34.333
- Ain't fair.
- ( Men laughing )

50:35.958 --> 50:38.083
Piney can't fight
worth a damn.

50:38.083 --> 50:40.333
Boy:
Let them fight.

50:42.833 --> 50:44.708
Let's go.

51:02.333 --> 51:04.250
Whose boy are you?

51:05.708 --> 51:07.916
Ethan Thompson's.

51:09.875 --> 51:12.458
Ethan the bay man.

51:13.041 --> 51:15.041
You know him?

51:22.958 --> 51:24.250
Thought you were being
clever before, hmm?

51:27.416 --> 51:28.875
Thought you were
gonna get something

51:28.875 --> 51:30.458
for being honest.

51:31.125 --> 51:33.833
What have you got?

51:41.791 --> 51:44.375
Everything goes through
me, understand?

51:44.375 --> 51:46.625
Big and little.

51:46.625 --> 51:49.125
Absecon Inlet
to Great Egg Harbor.

51:49.125 --> 51:51.250
Anything else
is bad for business.

51:59.458 --> 52:00.791
Here...

52:00.791 --> 52:01.750
( scrapes deck )

52:01.750 --> 52:04.166
is sand.

52:04.166 --> 52:06.875
There is a broom.

52:06.875 --> 52:10.208
And this...

52:10.208 --> 52:12.583
is one dollar.

52:18.583 --> 52:21.000
Yes, sir.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.208
Man:
Welcome to Atlantic City!

52:23.208 --> 52:24.875
We got umbrellas,
blankets...

52:24.875 --> 52:27.208
( music playing )

52:40.875 --> 52:43.416
( singing in Spanish )

52:59.083 --> 53:02.375
You saw what he did
with the ear?

53:02.375 --> 53:04.458
Is it still
in his pocket?

53:08.958 --> 53:10.666
Ronis doesn't need
to hear about any of this.

53:10.666 --> 53:12.291
As far as he's concerned,
nothing's happened

53:12.291 --> 53:14.791
and Lloyd's
still on board.

53:14.791 --> 53:16.250
Well, don't count on it.

53:16.250 --> 53:17.375
You're not the only one
who pays off the army.

53:19.750 --> 53:21.416
A man like me?

53:24.333 --> 53:26.041
Where's the sense
in looking back?

53:26.041 --> 53:28.958
Never does any good.

53:33.250 --> 53:36.000
"Be honest
and true, boys."

53:37.583 --> 53:39.000
What's that?

53:39.000 --> 53:41.250
Just running
through my head.

53:45.708 --> 53:47.500
Come up to the room.

53:47.500 --> 53:49.166
I'm on the Clipper
out tomorrow.

53:49.166 --> 53:51.958
- That's all right.
- No night to be alone.

53:53.541 --> 53:56.416
Sweetie, I'm not alone.

54:04.375 --> 54:06.833
Not all bad news.

54:06.833 --> 54:09.458
Won five pesos.

54:43.250 --> 54:45.583
Mrs. Lansky.

54:45.583 --> 54:48.125
I'm an old friend
of your husband's.

54:48.125 --> 54:50.916
Are you waiting
for him to join you?

54:50.916 --> 54:53.291
( speaking Spanish )

54:54.750 --> 54:55.291
Do you speak English?

54:57.333 --> 55:00.000
I speak, yes.

55:01.125 --> 55:02.625
You have a husband?

55:03.333 --> 55:05.708
You can be my husband.

55:05.708 --> 55:08.250
One night,
one week.

55:08.250 --> 55:10.208
We go around the corner,
I'll make you feel good.

55:19.000 --> 55:22.750
Elenore:
"The best and the truest;
Alas! Are the fewest;

55:22.750 --> 55:24.333
But be one of these
if you can.

55:27.750 --> 55:29.708
In duty, ne'er fail;

55:29.708 --> 55:31.166
You will find
'twill avail you,

55:31.166 --> 55:32.291
And bring its reward
when a man.

55:35.958 --> 55:37.833
Don't think life
plain sailing,

55:37.833 --> 55:39.083
there's danger of failing,

55:39.083 --> 55:41.958
though bright
the futures seem to be...

55:44.000 --> 55:46.541
but bright honor and labor
and truth to your neighbor

55:46.541 --> 55:49.208
will bear you safe
over life's seas.

55:51.541 --> 55:55.125
Then up and be doing,
Right only pursuing,

55:55.125 --> 55:57.333
And take your fair part
in the strife.

55:59.541 --> 56:01.041
Be honesty and true, boys!

56:01.041 --> 56:03.791
Whatever you do, boys,

56:03.791 --> 56:06.708
"Let this be your motto
through life!"
