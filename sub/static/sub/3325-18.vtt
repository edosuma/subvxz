00:01.002 --> 00:02.583
Previously on "Teen Wolf..."

00:02.795 --> 00:06.287
When a kitsune rubs its tails together
it can create fire or lighting.

00:06.549 --> 00:07.664
It's called foxfire.

00:07.884 --> 00:10.170
All day l have been hearing this sound.

00:10.344 --> 00:12.050
You've been right every time something
like this has happened.

00:12.221 --> 00:14.212
So don't start doubting yourself now.

00:14.390 --> 00:16.130
- Are you all right?
- I guess not really.

00:16.309 --> 00:18.300
They're called the oni.
They're looking for someone possessed,

00:18.519 --> 00:20.020
with a dark spirit attached to them.

00:41.417 --> 00:42.953
Hey, man, what's up?

00:46.130 --> 00:47.370
Stiles?

00:52.303 --> 00:53.383
Stiles? You there?

00:54.096 --> 00:55.381
Scott?

00:57.308 --> 00:58.718
Hey, I'm here.

00:59.268 --> 01:00.678
Are you okay? Can you hear me?

01:00.937 --> 01:04.646
Scott, I don't... I don't know where I am.
I don't know how I got here.

01:04.857 --> 01:06.688
I think was sleepwalking.

01:06.901 --> 01:10.769
Okay, um, can you see anything?
Just tell me what you see.

01:10.988 --> 01:13.400
Ah, it's dark. It's hard to see.

01:13.616 --> 01:15.447
I think there's something wrong with my...

01:23.918 --> 01:24.998
- Hey...
- Stiles?

01:25.211 --> 01:27.577
this is Stiles and you missed me.
Leave a message...

01:30.841 --> 01:32.217
Come on.

01:34.637 --> 01:35.877
Hey, this is St...

01:37.265 --> 01:38.971
God, come on.

01:40.059 --> 01:41.174
Come on.

01:42.853 --> 01:45.515
- Stiles?
- Scott, I don't think I can get out of here.

01:45.690 --> 01:47.226
- I can't move.
- Where are you?

01:47.400 --> 01:50.517
I don't know. I don't know, it's too dark.
I can't see much

01:50.903 --> 01:52.689
and something's wrong with my leg.

01:52.905 --> 01:54.691
lt's stuck on something. And it's...

01:54.907 --> 01:58.024
- I think it's bleeding.
- How bad? Stiles, how bad is it?

01:59.787 --> 02:02.073
Stiles, are you there? Can you hear me?

02:02.290 --> 02:04.702
Ah, there's some kind of smell down here.

02:04.917 --> 02:06.248
Something smells terrible.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.075
lt's brutal. My eyes are watering.

02:08.337 --> 02:10.999
- Okay, listen. I'm calling your dad.
- No, no, no, no, don't.

02:11.173 --> 02:13.255
- But your dad...
- Don't.

02:13.467 --> 02:16.550
Just please don't call him.
Promise me you won't.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.795
He already worries about me too much.
Scott, please.

02:19.181 --> 02:22.264
But what if I can't find you?
Stiles, I can't make a promise like that.

02:22.476 --> 02:26.094
No, no, no, just please.
Please, don't call him.

02:26.314 --> 02:27.724
Come find me. You can do if.

02:27.940 --> 02:29.726
He doesn't have to know.
Scott, you can find me.

02:29.984 --> 02:31.770
I don't know it I can do this.

02:31.986 --> 02:34.773
Oh, I gotta call you back.
I have to turn the phone off.

02:34.989 --> 02:36.069
What? No, hey, wait...

02:36.240 --> 02:38.652
- I'm gonna call you right back.
- Hold on, Stiles, wait...

02:38.868 --> 02:40.074
Hold on, man.

02:44.540 --> 02:46.656
Isaac! Isaac, get up!

02:47.293 --> 02:48.453
I need your help!

02:48.711 --> 02:50.622
- Isaac!
- Why? What's wrong?

02:51.839 --> 02:53.249
It's Stiles. Get dressed.

02:53.466 --> 02:54.797
What's wrong with Stiles?

02:59.680 --> 03:00.795
I don't know.

03:06.979 --> 03:08.014
I said hold still.

03:08.189 --> 03:09.645
Are we even allowed to be here this late?

03:09.857 --> 03:12.724
- What if security catches us?
- There is no security.

03:12.943 --> 03:14.774
The number of homicides
in this school has seen to it that

03:14.987 --> 03:17.694
no sane person will
ever take a night job here again.

03:18.115 --> 03:19.730
So we're all alone?

03:22.411 --> 03:23.446
You're losing the pose again.

03:23.621 --> 03:25.452
You know, when you said
you wanted me to model for you,

03:25.665 --> 03:27.826
this wasn't what I thought you had in mind.

03:28.542 --> 03:29.531
Oh, really?

03:34.090 --> 03:37.298
If you're thinking nude modeling,
it's usually done without the pants.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.438
- You hear that?
- Hear what?

03:56.696 --> 03:59.187
- You don't hear that?
- I hear music. What do you hear?

04:01.200 --> 04:02.280
Voices.

04:05.663 --> 04:09.155
Please, come find me.

04:12.628 --> 04:13.663
Hey, Stiles.

04:13.838 --> 04:16.250
Did you call him?
Did you call my dad?

04:16.424 --> 04:19.006
No. Just Isaac. We're coming to find you.

04:19.218 --> 04:20.298
Can you figure out where you are?

04:20.511 --> 04:21.717
Try to find something
and tell us where to look.

04:21.929 --> 04:23.089
It's a basement.

04:23.264 --> 04:26.427
I don't know, some kind of basement.

04:26.642 --> 04:29.509
- In a house?
- No. It looks bigger. Like industrial.

04:29.729 --> 04:32.095
I think there's a furnace. But it's cold.

04:32.314 --> 04:34.054
It's freezing down here.

04:34.275 --> 04:37.108
I gotta turn the...
I gotta turn the phone off. It's going to die.

04:37.278 --> 04:38.768
Wait, wait, wait.

04:39.196 --> 04:40.311
What else is there? What do you see?

04:40.531 --> 04:42.317
The phone's dying. I can't talk.

04:42.533 --> 04:43.773
I have to go.

04:44.326 --> 04:45.406
Please...

04:46.495 --> 04:48.360
Stiles, why are you whispering?

04:51.167 --> 04:53.579
Because I think
there's someone in here with me.

05:48.015 --> 05:50.256
Mom, my Iamp's dead.

05:50.476 --> 05:52.262
Do we have any more bulbs?

05:53.437 --> 05:54.677
Mom!

06:10.246 --> 06:11.452
What did you do?

06:11.622 --> 06:13.283
Uh, nothing. It was an accident.

06:13.499 --> 06:15.239
It's after midnight.
You should be asleep.

06:29.014 --> 06:30.265
Go to sleep.

06:40.609 --> 06:42.941
- How did you know? Did he call you too?
- I heard it.

06:43.153 --> 06:45.610
Don't ask.
It gets more confusing when you ask.

06:45.865 --> 06:48.231
- Okay.
- Not as confusing as this.

06:57.418 --> 06:59.204
He uses red for unsolved cases.

06:59.420 --> 07:01.251
Maybe he thinks he's part
of an unsolved case?

07:01.463 --> 07:03.590
Or is an unsolved case.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.134
Hold on.
Is he still out there?

07:06.343 --> 07:07.594
You don't know where he is?

07:07.803 --> 07:09.668
He said he is in
an industrial basement somewhere.

07:09.889 --> 07:12.346
- We came here to get a better scent.
- What else did he say?

07:12.558 --> 07:14.173
Something's wrong with his leg.
It's bleeding.

07:14.351 --> 07:16.307
- And he's freezing.
- Tonight's the coldest night of the year.

07:16.478 --> 07:17.888
It's going to drop into the 205.

07:18.147 --> 07:19.557
What did his dad say?

07:19.773 --> 07:22.435
We kind of... We didn't tell him yet.

07:22.651 --> 07:25.438
Stiles is bleeding and freezing
and you didn't call his dad?

07:25.654 --> 07:26.905
He made me promise not to.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.479
We can find him by scent.

07:28.699 --> 07:31.281
If he was sleepwalking
he couldn't have gotten far, right?

07:31.493 --> 07:33.745
You didn't notice his Jeep is gone, did you?

07:33.954 --> 07:35.945
You promised you wouldn't call his dad.
I didn't.

07:36.165 --> 07:40.124
Wait, Lydia, hold on. I can get more help.
I can call Derek, Allison...

07:40.336 --> 07:42.122
Everyone except for the cops. Great idea.

07:42.338 --> 07:45.421
You guys remember she gets these feelings
when someone's about to die, right?

07:49.386 --> 07:51.217
You don't have to call his dad.

07:51.430 --> 07:53.261
It's five minutes to the station.

07:53.599 --> 07:54.634
We'll catch up.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.060
What? Why?

07:57.269 --> 07:58.805
There's something here.

07:59.021 --> 08:00.227
Yeah.

08:00.481 --> 08:02.392
Evidence of total insanity.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.684
We can figure out what's wrong with him
after we find a way

08:07.905 --> 08:09.441
- to keep him from freezing to death.
- Go.

08:09.615 --> 08:10.570
We'll be right behind you.

08:40.479 --> 08:41.844
Who's there?

08:47.569 --> 08:49.730
I know you're there. I can hear you.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.024
Who are you?

10:02.603 --> 10:03.638
Self.

10:31.507 --> 10:32.667
Come on.

10:37.596 --> 10:39.882
If his Jeep is gone, that's where we start.

10:40.099 --> 10:41.054
Panbh,

10:41.225 --> 10:44.217
let's get an APB out on
a blue 1980 CJ-5 Jeep.

10:44.520 --> 10:46.886
Cordova, I want a list of
any kind of industrial basement

10:47.106 --> 10:48.562
or sub-level of any building

10:48.732 --> 10:50.723
that he could've gotten
into while sleepwalking.

10:50.943 --> 10:53.650
It's the coldest night of the year so far.
So if he's out there barefoot

10:53.862 --> 10:55.727
in just a T-shirt, he could
already be hypothermic.

10:55.948 --> 10:59.440
Let's move fast. Let's think fast.
The two of you, come with me.

11:01.787 --> 11:05.200
Okay. Is there anything you need to tell me
that I can't tell everybody out there?

11:05.415 --> 11:07.030
- Lydia knew he was missing.
- Can she help find him?

11:07.251 --> 11:08.206
She's working on it.

11:08.418 --> 11:10.545
- Anything else?
- I called Derek and Allison for help.

11:10.796 --> 11:13.378
Can you find him by scent?

11:15.676 --> 11:17.337
We got it, sir. We found the Jeep.

11:26.812 --> 11:29.144
It's dead.
He must have left the lights on.

11:29.356 --> 11:32.098
- Why would he come here?
- Let's find out.

11:36.572 --> 11:39.109
Security's doing sweeps of every floor.
Nothing yet.

11:39.283 --> 11:41.274
- What about the basement?
- Follow me.

11:50.669 --> 11:51.954
He's not here.

11:52.129 --> 11:53.960
- Not anymore.
- You mean the whole building?

11:54.173 --> 11:55.333
Gone.

11:56.592 --> 11:58.207
I'll go tell Stilinski.

11:59.094 --> 12:01.210
And see if you can find Allison.
She's not answering her phone.

12:08.145 --> 12:09.851
Notice how strong the scent is up here?

12:10.439 --> 12:11.929
Ever hear of chemo signals?

12:12.482 --> 12:14.689
Chemical signals that
communicate emotion.

12:14.860 --> 12:18.318
And just our sweat can give off
anger, fear or disgust.

12:19.364 --> 12:20.900
Take a deep breath

12:21.116 --> 12:22.572
and tell me what you feel.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.327
- Stress.
- And anxiety.

12:28.665 --> 12:30.872
- What was he doing up here?
- I don't know.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.416
But there was definitely
some kind of struggle.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.122
With who?

12:36.924 --> 12:38.164
Himself.

12:49.436 --> 12:50.721
Where is everyone?

12:51.438 --> 12:53.850
We get a lead
on our sword-wielding maniac?

12:54.024 --> 12:57.516
Nope. But we've got posters
up all over town for your guy.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.364
Not exactly how I described him
to the sketch artist.

13:01.573 --> 13:03.859
Well, you're not exactly the highest priority
of the night, Agent McCall.

13:04.076 --> 13:06.567
What does that mean?
What's the high priority?

13:14.127 --> 13:15.628
Didn't you draw this?

13:17.214 --> 13:18.294
Put that back.

13:18.507 --> 13:21.590
- It's yours, right?
- It's one of them. I guess.

13:21.802 --> 13:24.009
He likes you a lot, doesn't he?

13:24.263 --> 13:27.255
Maybe he likes the drawing a lot.

13:28.225 --> 13:29.431
"For Lydia."

13:29.810 --> 13:30.925
Okay.

13:33.939 --> 13:36.271
"Nothing at hospital.
Derek headed to high school.

13:36.483 --> 13:37.643
"Isaac going to find Allison."

13:38.360 --> 13:39.475
And Scott's with the Sheriff.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.144
And we're standing in a bedroom
staring at the walls.

13:53.375 --> 13:54.865
What did you just do?

13:55.377 --> 13:57.584
- Did you touch one of the strings?
- Maybe.

14:16.815 --> 14:18.851
What did that sound like to you?

14:19.651 --> 14:22.267
- Like a string being pulled.
- You didn't hear people whispering?

14:22.487 --> 14:24.318
I definitely did not hear people whispering.

14:36.335 --> 14:37.791
You didn't hear that?

14:38.253 --> 14:40.710
Lydia, I'm not sure anyone
hears what you hear.

14:40.922 --> 14:42.207
They're whispering.

14:45.427 --> 14:46.542
Something about a house.

14:46.762 --> 14:48.047
What house?

15:00.942 --> 15:02.227
That one.

15:05.197 --> 15:06.812
What's Eichen House?

15:07.407 --> 15:09.068
A mental health center.

15:10.452 --> 15:13.615
It's where William Barrow,
the shrapnel bomber, was committed.

15:13.830 --> 15:15.240
Is that it?

15:16.333 --> 15:17.664
That's where he is.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.789
That's where Stiles is.

15:35.143 --> 15:36.724
No, come on.

15:53.203 --> 15:54.693
Who's there?

15:54.996 --> 15:56.782
Who are you?

16:04.548 --> 16:05.788
What?

16:15.517 --> 16:17.849
I don't... I don't understand.

16:19.521 --> 16:22.638
Not "Who are you?", Stiles.

16:24.609 --> 16:25.894
Who are we?

16:28.280 --> 16:30.817
It's getting colder, Stiles.

16:31.241 --> 16:32.856
Did you notice

16:33.201 --> 16:35.362
that we've stopped shivering?

16:38.123 --> 16:41.411
Do you know why that's a bad sign?

16:41.751 --> 16:43.878
It's the body trying to conserve energy.

16:44.129 --> 16:47.212
It was my fifth grade science report.
Hypothermia.

16:47.424 --> 16:50.086
Our speech is starting to thicken.

16:51.636 --> 16:53.672
Then comes fatigue.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.470
Confusion.

16:57.434 --> 17:02.053
We're going to die
if we don't get out of here.

17:02.731 --> 17:05.768
Stop saying that. Stop saying we.

17:05.984 --> 17:09.067
We're just trying
to keep you from freezing to death.

17:09.279 --> 17:11.611
You better get up, Stiles.

17:12.324 --> 17:15.441
How? There's a freaking
steel-jawed trap on my leg!

17:21.833 --> 17:23.414
Is there?

17:25.003 --> 17:27.335
Notice something different?

17:29.090 --> 17:32.253
It was on your right leg before, wasn't it?

17:32.511 --> 17:33.796
No...

17:34.763 --> 17:36.549
Are you sure?

17:41.937 --> 17:44.349
What is this?
What are you doing?

17:44.648 --> 17:48.015
We're trying to save you, Stiles.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.570
We're trying to save your life.

17:59.204 --> 18:03.038
Lydia, I don't want to say
"Are you sure about this" but...

18:03.208 --> 18:05.199
No, he's here. I swear to God he's here.

18:16.054 --> 18:18.511
I need access to
all basement rooms in this facility.

18:19.432 --> 18:22.139
Hey, is this the exact transcript
of Scott and Stiles' phone call?

18:22.352 --> 18:24.889
- It's what he gave us.
- But these words. Stiles says,

18:25.063 --> 18:27.270
"Something smells terrible.
My eyes are watering."

18:28.692 --> 18:31.900
Hi, I'm Melissa McCall.
I was hoping to see Agent McCall.

18:33.863 --> 18:34.989
What are you doing here?

18:35.198 --> 18:37.314
My shift was over.
I just wanted to see if I could help.

18:39.244 --> 18:40.575
It's here.

18:41.663 --> 18:42.778
It's right here.

18:49.754 --> 18:51.085
Stiles?

19:09.316 --> 19:10.396
Lydia?

19:13.737 --> 19:14.943
I don't get it.

19:15.280 --> 19:16.736
This has to be it.

19:19.701 --> 19:21.191
Then where is he, huh?

19:22.037 --> 19:23.322
Where is he? Where is he?

19:30.754 --> 19:31.914
I'm sorry.

19:32.631 --> 19:34.292
I don't understand.

19:55.111 --> 19:56.487
So what are you saying?

19:56.696 --> 19:59.563
I'm saying the real question might be,
how do we know he's not still asleep?

19:59.783 --> 20:01.865
You mean he's been asleep the whole time?

20:02.077 --> 20:04.193
Well, people who sleepwalk
can do crazy things.

20:04.412 --> 20:07.700
One guy goes down to the kitchen
and cooks an entire meal.

20:07.916 --> 20:10.703
Another guy is found
mowing his lawn naked.

20:11.044 --> 20:12.454
Why's any of that matter?

20:13.004 --> 20:14.835
Remember that townhouse
apartment we lived in?

20:15.048 --> 20:17.664
There was that
one night I came home drunk...

20:17.884 --> 20:19.340
Oh, one night?

20:19.928 --> 20:21.634
Let me finish.

20:21.846 --> 20:24.132
So I'm drunk, passed out on the bed.

20:24.349 --> 20:25.885
I get up to go to the bathroom.

20:26.101 --> 20:28.433
Then all of a sudden I hear you yelling
"What the hell are you doing?"

20:28.645 --> 20:30.931
Because you were in the closet
peeing into the laundry basket.

20:31.147 --> 20:33.934
- Yeah, I thought it was the bathroom.
- Oh, no, you were drunk off your ass.

20:34.150 --> 20:36.311
Yeah, but I was
convinced it was the bathroom.

20:36.486 --> 20:37.441
Yeah.

20:37.612 --> 20:41.321
So how do we know isn't just convinced
he's in some kind of basement?

20:41.533 --> 20:42.989
And isn't actually there.

20:46.121 --> 20:49.454
I think when he called Scott,
he was still asleep.

20:49.999 --> 20:52.706
- And is still asleep right now.
- Then where is he?

20:53.211 --> 20:55.202
I got an idea about that too.

21:02.554 --> 21:05.671
You don't understand, do you?

21:08.727 --> 21:10.513
It's a riddle.

21:13.064 --> 21:15.225
Do you know any riddles, Stiles?

21:16.359 --> 21:17.474
A few.

21:17.694 --> 21:21.027
What gets bigger the more you take away?

21:21.698 --> 21:22.653
A hole.

21:22.866 --> 21:26.825
What gets wetter the more it dries?

21:27.036 --> 21:28.446
A towel.

21:28.621 --> 21:31.829
When is a door not a door?

21:34.544 --> 21:36.080
When it's ajar.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.713
Everyone has it,

21:41.760 --> 21:44.843
but no one can lose it.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.262
What is it?

21:49.267 --> 21:50.473
I don't...

21:59.903 --> 22:02.064
Everyone has it,

22:03.364 --> 22:06.447
but no one can lose it.

22:07.702 --> 22:09.408
What is it, Stiles?

22:09.621 --> 22:12.112
I don't... I don't know.

22:12.373 --> 22:13.783
Everyone has it,

22:15.251 --> 22:17.287
but no one can lose it.

22:27.972 --> 22:29.052
I don't know.

22:37.941 --> 22:39.351
No! No!

22:39.567 --> 22:42.058
No! No!

22:42.487 --> 22:45.445
No, wait!

22:50.161 --> 22:51.321
Wait!

22:52.580 --> 22:53.956
Wait!

22:56.000 --> 22:58.036
- Stiles.
- Wait! No, wait!

22:58.253 --> 22:59.208
Stiles!

22:59.379 --> 23:02.917
- Wait!
- Stiles, you're all right! Okay!

23:04.008 --> 23:05.123
You're all right.

23:09.264 --> 23:10.470
Stiles, you're all right.

23:25.947 --> 23:28.313
- What the hell have you been doing?
- Sleeping. What the hell are you doing?

23:28.533 --> 23:30.990
You didn't get any calls or texts?

23:38.293 --> 23:39.658
My phone's off.

23:40.169 --> 23:41.705
I never turn my phone off.

23:46.342 --> 23:48.799
Sleepwalking? Is he okay?

23:49.012 --> 23:52.300
Yeah, they found him a few minutes ago.
They're bringing him to the hospital.

23:52.473 --> 23:54.850
I don't know what happened.
I never turn it off.

24:03.109 --> 24:04.565
Who's that?

24:17.916 --> 24:20.248
So, you think he was just sleepwalking?
Or is there something more to it?

24:20.501 --> 24:22.753
In this town there's
always something more.

24:24.380 --> 24:26.166
What if I told you I know something more?

24:27.342 --> 24:29.048
I kind of overheard...

24:30.511 --> 24:32.888
Well, I listened in on Stiles talking to Scott.

24:33.097 --> 24:36.931
How he thinks he was the one that wrote
that message in the Chemistry room.

24:37.560 --> 24:39.801
The message telling Barrow to kill Kira.

24:40.021 --> 24:43.730
You think Stiles, skinny, defenseless Stiles

24:44.359 --> 24:45.895
is the nogitsune?

24:46.527 --> 24:48.438
A powerful, dark spirit?

24:48.780 --> 24:51.021
I'm not the only one thinking it.
I'm just the only one saying it.

24:51.240 --> 24:53.526
This thing wants to possess someone
and chooses Stiles?

24:53.743 --> 24:56.200
Why not take someone bigger, stronger?

24:56.412 --> 24:58.494
Someone with a little more...

25:01.668 --> 25:02.908
Power.

25:12.887 --> 25:14.093
He's sleeping now.

25:15.306 --> 25:16.466
And he's just fine.

25:17.308 --> 25:19.173
He doesn't remember much.

25:19.394 --> 25:21.385
It's a bit like a dream to him.

25:23.481 --> 25:24.470
Thank you.

25:24.691 --> 25:28.149
It was that repellent we sprayed in the
coyote den to keep other animals out.

25:29.278 --> 25:31.143
I couldn't go near it
without my eyes watering.

25:31.364 --> 25:32.945
It's just a good thing
he mentioned it over the phone.

25:33.116 --> 25:35.402
No, it was more than that. Thank you.

25:35.618 --> 25:36.778
It was a lucky connection.

25:36.953 --> 25:41.447
McCall, can you shut up please
and accept my sincerest gratitude.

25:45.962 --> 25:47.202
Accepted.

25:48.715 --> 25:50.501
All right, you two.
You've got school in less than six hours.

25:50.717 --> 25:52.423
- Go home. Go to sleep.
- Okay.

25:59.600 --> 26:00.976
I don't know what happened.

26:01.519 --> 26:03.305
I was so sure.

26:03.521 --> 26:05.432
Yeah, I wasn't much help either.

26:05.940 --> 26:07.350
Doesn't matter, if he's okay.

26:13.573 --> 26:15.188
Lydia, do you hear something?

26:16.826 --> 26:17.941
No.

26:18.619 --> 26:20.120
I didn't hear anything.

26:43.770 --> 26:45.135
Scott. Hey...

26:56.491 --> 26:58.152
He's a little preoccupied.

26:59.243 --> 27:01.199
- But I can help you.
- Why would you want to help me?

27:01.412 --> 27:03.027
Because I want you
to tell me everything that happened at

27:03.247 --> 27:05.033
the power station with William Barrow.

27:06.501 --> 27:08.708
Actually, I want you to show me.

27:11.631 --> 27:13.246
It was the other day.

27:13.508 --> 27:17.126
I asked him some questions.
Just symptoms and, um...

27:19.430 --> 27:20.545
Yeah.

27:22.100 --> 27:23.385
It's okay.

27:25.353 --> 27:26.968
I think |, Uh...

27:28.147 --> 27:30.354
I think I know what you're talking about.

27:30.566 --> 27:33.603
I've been writing these down
for the past two weeks.

27:43.955 --> 27:45.946
I think we need to do some tests.

27:52.672 --> 27:56.290
It was around here, I think.
But everything kind of looks the same now.

28:03.850 --> 28:06.637
What is that? Is that a baseball bat?

28:07.311 --> 28:09.176
It's Stiles' bat.

28:25.079 --> 28:26.660
It's magnetized.

28:41.554 --> 28:45.012
Kira, I'm going to need you to tell me
everything you know about foxfire.

28:59.030 --> 29:00.861
You're right. It's Japanese.

29:01.073 --> 29:02.574
- Who left this on your phone?
- I don't know.

29:02.742 --> 29:04.858
All of the messages are the same
and they all say Blocked ID.

29:05.077 --> 29:06.487
- Can you translate it?
- Mostly.

29:06.704 --> 29:08.820
The man speaking is
giving instructions actually.

29:09.040 --> 29:10.280
The first line is,

29:10.499 --> 29:12.285
"All evacuees are required to stay

29:12.501 --> 29:14.913
"at least 10 feet back from outside fences."

29:16.214 --> 29:18.546
What does that mean? What fences?

29:18.758 --> 29:21.716
The fences surrounding a Japanese
internment camp during World War II.

29:22.970 --> 29:26.804
After Pearl Harbor, Japanese-Americans
were rounded up and put in camps.

29:27.516 --> 29:30.553
This man is reading instructions
to prisoners upon their arrival.

29:32.396 --> 29:34.227
Well, where does
something like this come from?

29:34.732 --> 29:37.064
I have no idea.
Because it's fake.

29:37.777 --> 29:40.564
It mentions the name
of the internment camp as "Oak Creek."

29:40.863 --> 29:43.570
There was no internment camp
named Oak Creek in California.

29:50.039 --> 29:51.404
You okay?

29:52.375 --> 29:53.581
Yeah.

29:53.751 --> 29:56.458
I'm just a little hyper-sensitive
to loud sounds today.

30:01.509 --> 30:04.751
They're doing tests on Stiles all afternoon.

30:05.888 --> 30:08.004
I was going to go over
at around 6:00 to visit.

30:08.891 --> 30:10.392
You want to come with me?

30:10.601 --> 30:12.466
I should probably just go home.

30:17.483 --> 30:18.723
You sure you're okay?

30:21.487 --> 30:22.602
Yeah.

30:22.822 --> 30:24.653
I'll text you later.

30:37.962 --> 30:39.918
I'm not sure I know how to pronounce this.

30:40.131 --> 30:42.087
Or if it's not actually a misspelling.

30:42.300 --> 30:43.710
Just call him Stiles.

30:45.094 --> 30:46.083
Okay.

30:46.304 --> 30:48.135
Stiles, just to warn you,

30:48.347 --> 30:50.303
you're going to hear
a lot of noise during the MRI.

30:50.516 --> 30:51.881
It's due to pulses of electricity

30:52.101 --> 30:54.092
going through metal coils
inside the machine.

30:54.812 --> 30:57.098
Uh, if you want we can get you
earplugs or headphones.

30:57.440 --> 31:00.056
Oh, no, no, I don't need anything.

31:00.609 --> 31:03.271
Hey, we're just
on the other side of that window.

31:04.155 --> 31:05.440
- Okay?
- Okay.

31:15.916 --> 31:18.202
You know what they're looking for, right?

31:21.797 --> 31:24.004
It's called frontotemporal dementia.

31:27.053 --> 31:30.386
Areas of your brain start to shrink.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.051
It's what my mother had.

31:35.311 --> 31:39.429
It's the only form of dementia
that can hit teenagers.

31:42.151 --> 31:43.766
And there's no cure.

31:52.703 --> 31:56.036
Stiles, if you have it, we'll do something.

32:05.674 --> 32:06.800
I'll do something.

32:42.711 --> 32:44.121
I don't know if I should go in.

32:44.922 --> 32:46.253
You're going to tell Scott

32:46.507 --> 32:49.419
that Barrow might
have used foxfire created by me

32:49.593 --> 32:52.255
to jump start
the nogitsune's power inside Stiles.

32:52.596 --> 32:53.585
Yeah.

32:54.098 --> 32:56.714
Basically that I helped a dark spirit

32:56.934 --> 32:59.220
take control of his best friend.

33:00.020 --> 33:01.521
You should probably wait here.

33:13.451 --> 33:16.568
Okay, Stiles. This will take
about 45 minutes to an hour.

33:17.246 --> 33:19.032
Now remember, try not to move.

33:21.125 --> 33:22.615
Even just a little bit.

33:25.045 --> 33:26.660
Stiles, you're going to hear that noise now.

33:27.923 --> 33:29.584
It's going to be a loud clanging.

33:29.800 --> 33:32.007
Kind of like a hammer hitting an anvil.

33:57.661 --> 34:00.994
You know the stuff you were telling me
about chemo signals earlier?

34:01.624 --> 34:03.535
It reminded me
of the time you were teaching me

34:03.751 --> 34:05.366
to use anger to control the shift.

34:05.586 --> 34:08.202
I think you ended up
teaching me more about that.

34:11.509 --> 34:12.874
Are you teaching me again?

34:13.052 --> 34:15.885
Think of it more like
sharing a few trade secrets.

34:16.889 --> 34:19.380
You know, I took Cora
back to South America, right?

34:19.558 --> 34:21.935
It's where she spent
most of her time after the fire.

34:22.102 --> 34:24.969
But that's not the only reason I left.

34:25.189 --> 34:26.599
I needed to talk to my mother.

34:26.815 --> 34:28.271
Your dead mother?

34:28.484 --> 34:31.146
She told me something that
changed my perspective

34:31.946 --> 34:33.356
on a lot of things.

34:34.323 --> 34:36.905
She said that my family
didn'tjust live in Beacon Hills.

34:37.117 --> 34:38.277
They protected it.

34:38.744 --> 34:40.530
This town needs someone to protect it.

34:40.913 --> 34:42.073
Someone like you.

34:47.336 --> 34:49.748
And someone like you
to teach me a few trade secrets.

34:57.680 --> 34:59.136
He was trying to protect us.

35:00.432 --> 35:01.842
Stiles was protecting us.

35:02.059 --> 35:03.139
From himself.

35:04.061 --> 35:06.097
- What are we looking for?
- I'm not sure.

35:06.313 --> 35:08.474
But I think Stiles wasn't just
up here struggling with himself.

35:08.649 --> 35:11.106
I think he was struggling
not to do something.

35:57.948 --> 35:59.233
See this?

36:00.451 --> 36:02.362
The tissue here and there.

36:04.622 --> 36:07.329
Both those spots are
showing signs of atrophy.

36:12.504 --> 36:13.835
Atrophy.

36:14.048 --> 36:15.458
I'm sorry.

36:54.713 --> 36:57.671
Have you
figured out my riddle yet?

37:01.053 --> 37:03.294
If you answer correctly,

37:03.847 --> 37:07.635
we might consider letting them go.

37:08.977 --> 37:10.513
Letting who go?

37:13.649 --> 37:15.480
Your friends.

37:16.944 --> 37:18.809
Your family.

37:22.199 --> 37:26.408
Everyone who ever
meant something to you.

37:28.122 --> 37:32.411
We're going to destroy all of them, Stiles.

37:34.169 --> 37:37.787
One-by-one.

37:39.800 --> 37:40.960
Why?

37:41.176 --> 37:43.258
Everyone has it,

37:43.512 --> 37:46.879
but no one can lose it.

37:47.099 --> 37:48.635
What is it?

37:50.102 --> 37:52.309
- I don't know.
- Everyone has it,

37:52.730 --> 37:55.472
but no one can lose it.

37:55.691 --> 37:57.773
- What is it?
- I don't know.

37:57.985 --> 38:00.647
Everyone has it,

38:01.488 --> 38:04.855
but no one can lose it.

38:05.826 --> 38:08.112
What is it?

38:12.416 --> 38:14.828
What is it?

38:15.502 --> 38:17.083
I don't know.

38:21.008 --> 38:22.999
What is it, Stiles?

38:25.053 --> 38:26.384
A shadow.

39:08.013 --> 39:10.800
- What was that?
- It sounded like a power surge.

39:13.185 --> 39:14.345
Where's my son?

40:12.995 --> 40:14.155
You know me.

40:18.292 --> 40:22.160
Then you remember that I won't be deterred
by your choice of host.

40:22.504 --> 40:24.620
Even if it's an innocent boy.

40:26.633 --> 40:28.214
Are you threatening us?

40:35.642 --> 40:37.633
Now I'm threatening you.

40:38.228 --> 40:41.095
We're not really afraid of your little fireflies.

40:47.863 --> 40:49.728
If the oni can't defeat you,

40:50.574 --> 40:52.189
I know someone who will.

41:09.134 --> 41:10.214
Oh, my God.
