00:13.013 --> 00:17.483
Tonight, we uncover
a heavy stream of reports

00:17.485 --> 00:20.519
of a disease outbreak
more deadly than cancer.

00:20.521 --> 00:25.124
Common symptoms include
large blisters on the skin

00:25.126 --> 00:26.625
from sun exposure.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.694
[speaking in foreign language]

00:30.530 --> 00:33.365
News reports confirm
the recent discovery

00:33.367 --> 00:35.067
that blood donation facilities

00:35.069 --> 00:36.635
have knowingly
been distributing blood

00:36.637 --> 00:38.804
to these so-called vampires
around the world.

00:38.806 --> 00:40.272
...only now discovered
the aggressiveness

00:40.274 --> 00:42.107
of this new mutated disease.

00:42.109 --> 00:44.343
Doctors are baffled
at the sheer number of people

00:44.345 --> 00:46.178
affected by this disease

00:46.180 --> 00:48.814
and how it's been hidden
for so long, up until now.

00:48.816 --> 00:50.783
This is a result
of deficiencies

00:50.785 --> 00:53.185
of active enzymes
in the liver and skin.

00:53.187 --> 00:57.289
It was first discovered
by King George III of England

00:57.291 --> 01:01.193
in 1811, when he was diagnosed
with this disease.

01:01.195 --> 01:03.595
After several rumored attacks,
a person claiming to be

01:03.597 --> 01:05.364
one of the vampire
sectional leaders

01:05.366 --> 01:07.399
has come forward
to make an official statement

01:07.401 --> 01:09.802
and address
the public's concerns.

01:09.804 --> 01:12.337
This is simply
a disease that we are

01:12.339 --> 01:14.273
that we are suffering from.

01:14.275 --> 01:17.242
We are, uh, we are not monsters.

01:17.244 --> 01:19.745
We are simply people
trying to survive.

01:19.747 --> 01:22.381
<i>[male #1] What about the
news reports of vampires using</i>

01:22.383 --> 01:24.149
<i>blood-donation facilities?</i>

01:24.151 --> 01:26.385
Well, I'd like
to make a point about that.

01:26.387 --> 01:29.855
The-the-the people
who have donated blood

01:29.857 --> 01:32.558
have done so
on a voluntary basis.

01:32.560 --> 01:36.095
No one was forced to give blood

01:36.097 --> 01:38.697
at these
participating facilities.

01:38.699 --> 01:42.167
<i>[male #1] Is there anything else
you'd like to tell our audience?</i>

01:42.169 --> 01:44.169
Uh...

01:44.171 --> 01:47.573
W- we have feelings
just like anybody else.

01:47.575 --> 01:49.441
We, uh...

01:49.443 --> 01:51.577
We just want
to co-exist in peace.

01:51.579 --> 01:54.746
We don't wanna hurt anyone
in any way, shape or form.

01:54.748 --> 01:59.485
And we sincerely hope that
people feel that way about us.

02:12.765 --> 02:16.768
<i>- It's, this is on.
- ...get this gig.</i>

02:16.770 --> 02:19.705
<i>- Sure you wanna...
- Yeah. Okay.</i>

02:19.707 --> 02:22.841
Hi. Uh, I-I'm Benny. This is...

02:22.843 --> 02:25.277
This is my first time
out in the field.

02:25.279 --> 02:27.579
I thought it'd be great
to document my experience

02:27.581 --> 02:32.317
because I'm gonna be joining
that team in there.

02:32.319 --> 02:34.620
<i>That's Mike.
That dude's a legend.</i>

02:34.622 --> 02:37.456
<i>He's one of the biggest names
as far as documentarians go.</i>

02:37.458 --> 02:39.291
<i>He actually uncovered
the evidence that linked</i>

02:39.293 --> 02:41.593
<i>the blood donation facilities
to all the vampires.</i>

02:41.595 --> 02:44.796
I swear to God, there is
something seriously wrong.

02:44.798 --> 02:47.299
- Oh, yeah.
- I'm not kidding.

02:47.301 --> 02:49.902
<i>[Benny] There's Carrie.
She's pretty hot, isn't she?</i>

02:49.904 --> 02:52.604
<i>She's been Mike's
right-hand man, uh, woman</i>

02:52.606 --> 02:53.872
<i>since the beginning.</i>

02:53.874 --> 02:56.441
Not everyone can be
as slop as you.

02:56.443 --> 02:58.810
<i>Oh, and that's Aaron.
He's my sister's husband.</i>

02:58.812 --> 03:00.546
<i>He sort of runs the station.</i>

03:00.548 --> 03:01.947
<i>Think he's about to announce</i>

03:01.949 --> 03:04.483
<i>that I'm gonna be joining
the team.</i>

03:04.485 --> 03:06.618
Okay. So...

03:08.922 --> 03:10.622
We just got the go ahead

03:10.624 --> 03:12.658
to film
that supposed vampire family.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.359
Alright! I knew it.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.395
I'm sure
they're just a bunch of nuts

03:16.397 --> 03:18.230
but it'll be good
for the ratings.

03:18.232 --> 03:20.465
I figured they were
gonna give it to us

03:20.467 --> 03:21.733
when we broke the story.

03:21.735 --> 03:24.236
Now, we gotta go over
a few things.

03:24.238 --> 03:27.206
- Okay.
- One...

03:27.208 --> 03:30.542
They only want three people
in the house.

03:30.544 --> 03:33.378
Hold on a second, Aaron,
you know we have a crew

03:33.380 --> 03:36.815
of ten, uh, seven, minimum
to be able to do the job.

03:36.817 --> 03:39.551
You're gonna have three
this time. That's all they want.

03:39.553 --> 03:42.621
That's the way they want it,
that's the way it's gonna be.

03:42.623 --> 03:45.424
Fine. Uh, do you want
to give Evan a call?

03:45.426 --> 03:46.858
I mean,
he's good at multitasking.

03:46.860 --> 03:49.228
Probably call Don.
He's probably available.

03:49.230 --> 03:50.395
- He just finished...
- Uh...

03:50.397 --> 03:52.965
- You're taking Benny.
- Benny?

03:52.967 --> 03:54.866
As-as in your-your
brother-in-law?

03:54.868 --> 03:56.401
As in my brother-in-law.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.804
Uh, Aaron, he doesn't have
the proper experience

03:58.806 --> 04:00.339
to be on this crew.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.307
He'll be fine.

04:02.309 --> 04:04.343
I'm sick and tired
of my wife breaking

04:04.345 --> 04:06.778
my balls I don't give this kid
enough to do.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.013
I'm sure you can appreciate

04:08.015 --> 04:09.481
the importance of me being...

04:09.483 --> 04:11.750
He'll be fine.
Benny, get in here!

04:11.752 --> 04:13.785
And turn
that goddamn camera off!

04:13.787 --> 04:15.921
<i>[Benny]
Oh, shit. Coming.</i>

04:19.926 --> 04:21.760
You'll be working
with Mike and Carrie

04:21.762 --> 04:23.295
on that vampire story.

04:23.297 --> 04:26.365
<i>- Is that camera off?
- Oh, yeah. It-it's off.</i>

04:26.367 --> 04:28.033
I'm gonna go over this with you.

04:30.503 --> 04:32.804
While you're in the house

04:32.806 --> 04:34.840
you may not bring with you...

04:36.342 --> 04:39.678
any crosses, rosary beads...

04:41.581 --> 04:44.016
holy water, steaks...

04:44.018 --> 04:45.717
This is ridiculous.

04:46.986 --> 04:48.654
Look, this is what they want.

04:48.656 --> 04:51.290
Well, how do we know
they're not gonna infect us

04:51.292 --> 04:52.424
or kill us?

04:52.426 --> 04:55.727
They're not gonna infect
or kill you.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.996
Now, this is all coming
from the sect leader.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.631
Well, what is a sect leader?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.701
The sectional leader.

05:02.703 --> 05:05.037
He's the one
that arranged all this.

05:07.340 --> 05:08.974
They want you
to go there tonight.

05:08.976 --> 05:12.044
While you're in the house,
I want you to report to me.

05:12.046 --> 05:14.379
Aye-aye, captain.

05:14.381 --> 05:16.014
- Any other questions?
- Oh, uh...

05:16.016 --> 05:17.582
Oh, shuck.

05:17.584 --> 05:19.418
Do we have permission
to stake them

05:19.420 --> 05:22.821
in the heart
if they vamp out on us?

05:22.823 --> 05:26.058
Mike, you're in charge here.

05:26.060 --> 05:28.827
So you fuck up, you know what.

05:30.897 --> 05:32.464
Thanks, Aaron.

05:32.466 --> 05:34.633
- You're in trouble.
- I'm not in trouble.

05:34.635 --> 05:36.068
I wish I had that recorded

05:36.070 --> 05:37.703
so I could play it back.

05:37.705 --> 05:40.038
<i>[Benny]
Actually I, I did record it.</i>

05:41.741 --> 05:43.408
- Really?
- That...

05:43.410 --> 05:44.843
<i>[Benny]
Yeah. I-I thought it'd be...</i>

05:44.845 --> 05:46.878
That's good.
Can you shut the camera off?

05:46.880 --> 05:48.513
I thought you'd do that.

05:52.385 --> 05:56.121
I never stop rollin'... bitch.

05:56.123 --> 05:58.357
<i>[Mike]
Benny, quit jerkin' off!</i>

05:58.359 --> 05:59.391
Alright.

06:01.861 --> 06:03.495
She's a little cranky right now

06:03.497 --> 06:05.530
<i>since Carrie and him,
you know...</i>

06:05.532 --> 06:08.033
You understand how expensive
a Lavalier mic is?

06:08.035 --> 06:09.868
<i>[Benny] Today's our
first day of production.</i>

06:09.870 --> 06:11.503
<i>We just got
the official word</i>

06:11.505 --> 06:13.105
<i>that we've been granted
exclusive access...</i>

06:13.107 --> 06:16.141
Benny. Benny,
pay attention. Okay?

06:16.143 --> 06:17.576
These batteries are charged,
right?

06:17.578 --> 06:19.077
<i>- Uh...
- Did you...</i>

06:19.079 --> 06:21.913
Did you charge the other ones
like I asked you to?

06:21.915 --> 06:23.548
<i>[Benny] Uh, yeah. They're almost ready.</i>

06:23.550 --> 06:25.016
- This should be filmed.
- Alright, Carrie...

06:25.018 --> 06:27.052
Can you take notes?
We're gonna take inventory.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.154
Yeah.

06:29.156 --> 06:31.590
Come on, Benny, let's do this.
Call it out.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.725
<i>[Benny] Alright, we have two main DSLRs.</i>

06:35.428 --> 06:37.796
<i>- Okay, there's one.
- Two DSLRs.</i>

06:37.798 --> 06:40.599
- Battery is in here.
- Alright.

06:40.601 --> 06:41.933
- Keep it goin'.
- What else?

06:41.935 --> 06:44.536
<i>And then we got
two of these handhelds.</i>

06:44.538 --> 06:47.472
- You've the case for this?
- No, you have the case for...

06:47.474 --> 06:49.508
Benny, you're gonna
get the case for this.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.143
Come on, I don't have all day.

06:51.145 --> 06:53.111
<i>We've three of these
hidden IP cameras</i>

06:53.113 --> 06:55.547
<i>capable of transmitting
their signal to a phone app.</i>

06:55.549 --> 06:58.049
Check these things out.
These are bad-ass, huh?

06:58.051 --> 07:01.186
[Carrie]
Mm-hmm. What else?

07:01.188 --> 07:05.524
<i>Uh, we also have this Hi8.</i>

07:05.526 --> 07:06.758
<i>- Hi8.
- Okay...</i>

07:06.760 --> 07:08.593
Why are you bringing
a Hi8 along?

07:08.595 --> 07:10.095
<i>For night vision.</i>

07:10.097 --> 07:12.531
<i>I thought
it'd be cool to have and stuff.</i>

07:12.533 --> 07:15.100
Yeah, that's gonna come in
real handy, Benny.

07:16.969 --> 07:19.504
Oh, uh, and last but not least

07:19.506 --> 07:22.007
<i>we have two of these
wireless HD micro cameras.</i>

07:22.009 --> 07:24.876
<i>They're the size
of a shirt button.</i>

07:24.878 --> 07:27.112
Can I get one
to spy on my roommate?

07:27.114 --> 07:28.747
You wanna spy on your roommate?

07:28.749 --> 07:29.981
- Yeah, I'm positive.
- We could've...

07:29.983 --> 07:32.184
- Oh, my God, please.
- What?

07:32.186 --> 07:34.219
It's not like
I haven't seen it before.

07:34.221 --> 07:35.654
Oh, my God!

07:35.656 --> 07:37.722
- Uh, alright, Benny...
- Is that it?

07:37.724 --> 07:39.558
Okay, it's really cute
that you're filming

07:39.560 --> 07:41.593
but can you stop?
I mean, I don't...

07:41.595 --> 07:44.596
Or why are you filming?
I don't even understand.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.231
<i>[Benny] Well, I'm also
documenting the journey.</i>

07:46.233 --> 07:48.900
<i>You know,
so we can get everything.</i>

07:48.902 --> 07:53.672
That's good. Why don't you cut
and help us load up the gear?

07:53.674 --> 07:56.208
Start by getting the case
for this handheld.

07:56.210 --> 07:57.676
- Please...
- Really?

07:57.678 --> 07:59.110
- Yeah.
- Why don't you shut up?

07:59.112 --> 08:00.745
- Right.
- Did you finish the inventory?

08:00.747 --> 08:02.047
I can't read your handwriting.

08:02.049 --> 08:04.115
Benny,
the case for this handheld.

08:04.117 --> 08:06.251
Let's load up the truck.
Come on.

08:10.857 --> 08:13.859
Do you remember what I said
when we first started dating?

08:13.861 --> 08:15.760
<i>[Benny]
They are still at it.</i>

08:15.762 --> 08:17.262
What are you talking about?

08:17.264 --> 08:19.097
You honestly don't remember
what I said?

08:19.099 --> 08:21.533
No, I don't remember.
That was five years ago.

08:21.535 --> 08:23.969
It's nice to know
that I had such little meaning...

08:23.971 --> 08:26.004
- Oh, my God, fucking, drop it.
- Fine.

08:26.973 --> 08:28.173
Wait here.

08:29.809 --> 08:32.910
<i>- W-where's he going?
- Beats me.</i>

08:35.515 --> 08:38.216
<i>[Benny] What the hell? Is
he running into that church?</i>

08:38.217 --> 08:40.018
No, he's coming back now.

08:40.020 --> 08:43.188
<i>Sounds like you two had
some issues to work out?</i>

08:43.190 --> 08:45.624
Yeah, sorry about that,
he's good at his job

08:45.626 --> 08:47.759
but he could be
an arrogant prick sometimes.

08:51.597 --> 08:54.566
<i>- Holy water.
- Is that what you were doing?</i>

08:54.568 --> 08:56.568
Yeah. Yeah.

08:56.570 --> 08:58.203
<i>[Benny] Thought Aaron
said we weren't supposed...</i>

08:58.205 --> 09:00.238
You know what,
Aaron's not the one there

09:00.240 --> 09:02.073
riskin' his neck, is he?

09:03.142 --> 09:04.776
So fuck him!

09:05.545 --> 09:08.547
[car doors shut]

09:10.116 --> 09:14.085
[Mike]
Fuck. I'm kinda freaked out.

09:14.087 --> 09:17.055
[Carrie] Wow! This looks
straight out of a horror movie.

09:17.057 --> 09:21.626
I guess they have a flair
for the theatrics, don't they?

09:21.628 --> 09:23.662
Maybe one of us should grab
the gear...

09:23.664 --> 09:25.830
<i>[female #1]
Hello.</i>

09:25.832 --> 09:28.600
<i>Hi. You guys
are the camera crew, right?</i>

09:28.602 --> 09:31.770
<i>- Yeah, that's right.
- Yeah, that's the wrong house.</i>

09:31.772 --> 09:34.706
<i>[female #1] That was
abandoned. We live over here.</i>

09:34.708 --> 09:36.975
<i>You honestly thought
we lived there?</i>

09:36.977 --> 09:38.877
No, uh, our station manager

09:38.879 --> 09:41.713
just must've given us
the wrong address.

09:41.715 --> 09:44.215
Fuck, if that's
not embarrassing.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.851
Alright, remember,
uh, nice and polite.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.024
- Hi, I'm Mike.
- Hi. Hi, Mike.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.326
I'll be conducting
the interviews.

09:54.328 --> 09:56.294
Elleanor.
But you can call me Elle.

09:56.296 --> 09:58.129
Elle, lemme
introduce you to the crew.

09:58.131 --> 09:59.364
This is Carrie,
running sound.

09:59.366 --> 10:00.999
- Hi, Carrie.
- Nice to meet you.

10:01.001 --> 10:02.634
And behind the lens,
that's Benny.

10:02.636 --> 10:03.935
He's operating the camera.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.737
<i>- Hi, Benny.
- Hi.</i>

10:05.739 --> 10:09.341
I guess I'll have to get used
to having a camera around.

10:09.343 --> 10:12.611
Um, okay.
Everyone, please, come inside.

10:19.719 --> 10:21.987
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.

10:21.989 --> 10:24.990
The camera crew
from the news station is here.

10:24.992 --> 10:27.826
Oh, can you get a shot
of that mirror, please? Benny.

10:27.828 --> 10:30.862
<i>- Copy that.
- The mirror? Where?</i>

10:30.864 --> 10:32.897
Oh, I see.

10:32.899 --> 10:34.766
No, we're not as, uh, mystical

10:34.768 --> 10:37.769
as Hollywood
has made us up to be.

10:37.771 --> 10:41.806
I'm glad that you're here
to dispel that image.

10:41.808 --> 10:44.643
I'm gonna get started on dinner,
leave you guys to it.

10:44.645 --> 10:46.378
- Okay.
- Where's Blake and Selvin?

10:46.380 --> 10:49.914
I just saw Blake. I think Selvin
is off hiding in the basement.

10:49.916 --> 10:51.750
Okay, so who do we have here?

10:51.752 --> 10:53.785
- Oh, I'm Mike.
- How are you doing, Mike?

10:53.787 --> 10:54.886
- I'm Andrew.
- Hi. Carrie.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.121
- Carrie.
- Nice to meet you.

10:56.123 --> 10:58.390
- This is Benny.
- Hi, Benny.

10:58.392 --> 11:01.926
- Thanks for havin' us.
- My pleasure.

11:01.928 --> 11:03.128
- Well, this is...
- Blake.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.763
Blake, this is the camera crew

11:04.765 --> 11:05.997
that I told you about.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.700
Oh! Hey-hey. I'm Blake.

11:08.702 --> 11:10.435
I'm really excited
to have you guys.

11:10.437 --> 11:12.871
Yeah, Blake, you should show 'em
to their rooms

11:12.873 --> 11:15.674
let 'em get settled, we'll have
some supper or somethin'.

11:15.676 --> 11:18.410
What kind of supper
did you have in mind?

11:18.412 --> 11:21.046
Supper. Food. Um...

11:21.048 --> 11:23.048
Another...
Oh...

11:23.050 --> 11:24.883
You don't have anything
to worry about.

11:24.885 --> 11:26.718
We've been dining with humans
for years.

11:26.720 --> 11:27.986
- Oh.
- And on them.

11:31.023 --> 11:34.025
- He's kidding.
- I'm kidding. Just kidding.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.894
Maybe, we're...
Is that working?

11:35.896 --> 11:37.395
- Yeah.
- Could we just start over?

11:37.397 --> 11:39.230
Well, we can just erase
that part.

11:39.232 --> 11:41.032
- Erase it. Thanks. Okay.
- Yeah.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.267
Yeah. We'll erase that part.

11:42.269 --> 11:43.868
Upstairs.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.270
Okay. Come on.

11:45.272 --> 11:48.106
Uh, actually, is it,
is it possible to pull our truck

11:48.108 --> 11:50.375
into the driveway
to unload our equipment?

11:50.377 --> 11:52.043
Sure. That's why you're here.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.111
- Great.
- Great.

11:53.113 --> 11:54.746
Alright, we'll back in a minute.

11:54.748 --> 11:57.115
- Benny, put down the camera.
- Thanks.

11:57.117 --> 11:58.149
Benny!

11:59.485 --> 12:01.753
Alright. Right this way.

12:01.755 --> 12:03.822
<i>- I'm on camera, right?
- Yep, we got you.</i>

12:03.824 --> 12:06.791
Okay, cool, this is
my good side, so you can get...

12:06.793 --> 12:09.794
This place is pretty amazing.
How long have you lived here?

12:09.796 --> 12:11.429
Yeah, 12 years, you know?

12:11.431 --> 12:13.965
But, uh, I'm really excited
to have you guys.

12:13.967 --> 12:16.468
I mean, I personally insisted
that you guys come.

12:16.470 --> 12:18.503
Yeah. I've always wanted
to be on TV.

12:18.505 --> 12:20.105
Why's that?

12:20.107 --> 12:22.140
You know, we stayed out
of the limelight

12:22.142 --> 12:24.509
all these years because,
you know, whatever...

12:24.511 --> 12:27.779
The cat's out of the bag now,
so this is my chance

12:27.781 --> 12:30.315
to be famous, so...
I'm gonna show you guys around.

12:30.317 --> 12:31.950
Gonna show you the inside scoop.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.418
Okay. Sounds great. Thanks.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.920
You guys let me know
if you need anything

12:35.922 --> 12:37.789
anything at all, okay?

12:37.791 --> 12:40.959
- Where's that stair going?
- Oh, yeah. Right, right here.

12:42.928 --> 12:45.263
Ah, yeah.
Yeah, once you guys in here...

12:45.265 --> 12:46.898
This is where he wants you.

12:46.900 --> 12:49.067
So just, you know, get settled

12:49.069 --> 12:51.436
and, uh, when you guys are ready

12:51.438 --> 12:53.471
come downstairs,
we got some delish food, okay?

12:53.473 --> 12:55.039
<i>[Mike]
Awesome. Sounds good.</i>

12:55.041 --> 12:57.075
This is gonna be
in the documentary, right?

12:57.077 --> 12:58.843
- Yeah, I mean, you know...
- Okay.

12:58.845 --> 13:00.245
- Come on back down.
- Okay.

13:02.047 --> 13:03.882
Carrie, looks like
you and I can...

13:03.884 --> 13:05.283
I'm gonna take the single

13:05.285 --> 13:07.952
and you and Benny
are gonna share the queen.

13:10.022 --> 13:12.557
Great.

13:12.559 --> 13:15.393
<i>[Benny] Here, put this on. They
won't know you're recording 'em.</i>

13:17.897 --> 13:20.098
<i>Do you need some help
putting it on?</i>

13:20.100 --> 13:21.299
Can you help me?

13:23.068 --> 13:25.103
Just put it right
in that button hole.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.309
<i>- Is it hidden enough?
- Lemme check the camera feed.</i>

13:33.045 --> 13:34.579
<i>[Mike]
Pretty good.</i>

13:34.581 --> 13:39.417
Uh, seems like
the signal's weak or something.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.486
We don't time
to fix it right now.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.321
Just make my micro-cam
the B cam

13:43.323 --> 13:45.590
and use the A. Let's go.

13:46.492 --> 13:47.525
Okay.

13:49.261 --> 13:51.129
<i>- Well, the music they blocked...
- Shit.</i>

13:59.438 --> 14:03.107
Ah, hello, good evening.
Come, sit. Eat.

14:04.310 --> 14:06.144
- Have a seat.
- Oh, thank you.

14:06.146 --> 14:07.579
Thanks.

14:07.581 --> 14:08.847
[Carrie clears throat]

14:11.851 --> 14:15.987
<i>- You are welcome to sit as well.
- Oh. Thanks. I'll stand.</i>

14:15.989 --> 14:19.057
It's his job
to operate the camera, so...

14:19.059 --> 14:20.558
Oh, I see.

14:20.560 --> 14:23.595
Uh, uh, well,
so wh-what do you two do?

14:23.597 --> 14:27.498
Oh, um, I run sound,
I operate equipment.

14:27.500 --> 14:30.335
- Take notes. Stuff like that.
- Uh-huh. And you, Mike?

14:30.337 --> 14:32.036
I conduct the interviews.

14:32.038 --> 14:34.205
You know,
ask questions, keep it goin'.

14:34.207 --> 14:37.008
So you're, like,
the face of the documentary?

14:37.010 --> 14:38.476
You could say that,
but ultimately

14:38.478 --> 14:40.078
the story's about you.

14:41.647 --> 14:43.114
Righteous, man.

14:43.116 --> 14:45.917
That's Blake.
And this is Selvin.

14:45.919 --> 14:49.320
Selvin is a... is a quiet one
in the family.

14:49.322 --> 14:50.955
You know, he's a little shy

14:50.957 --> 14:52.991
but once he knows you,
he'll warm up.

14:52.993 --> 14:54.225
- Alright.
- Here you go.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.127
- Oh, thank you.
- Selvin, sit down.

14:56.129 --> 14:58.429
Oh. Um, what is it?

14:59.899 --> 15:01.666
Oh, that's a, uh, ham steak.

15:01.668 --> 15:03.101
That's from a pig.

15:03.103 --> 15:06.170
[Carrie laughs]
Of course. I'm sorry, I...

15:06.172 --> 15:08.106
- I...
- Give us a little credit.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.674
We've been entertaining
for centuries.

15:09.676 --> 15:12.310
We do know
how to make you guys a meal.

15:12.312 --> 15:14.012
Sorry if Carrie offended you.

15:14.014 --> 15:16.080
Hm, it's quite alright.

15:16.082 --> 15:18.216
Um, are you gonna be eating?

15:18.218 --> 15:19.417
<i>- Um...
- Uh, yeah.</i>

15:19.419 --> 15:22.220
No, no, no.
He'll-he'll eat later.

15:23.155 --> 15:25.490
Um, what about you guys?

15:25.492 --> 15:28.159
<i>- Oh, uh...
- Are you eating?</i>

15:28.161 --> 15:29.427
Us, as you know, we're...

15:29.429 --> 15:31.062
Our diet consists of something

15:31.064 --> 15:32.964
a little bit different.

15:32.966 --> 15:35.199
It's kind of a,
kind of a liquid diet.

15:35.201 --> 15:37.302
Oh, so that's blood?

15:37.304 --> 15:39.637
It's blood
from the Czech Republic.

15:42.274 --> 15:45.443
So you guys
don't hunt humans for food?

15:45.445 --> 15:49.380
Hm. Goodness, no.

15:49.382 --> 15:52.717
That would be like, you hunted
that pig for your supper.

15:52.719 --> 15:56.587
- Well, there are actually some...
- Blake, you're interrupting.

15:56.589 --> 15:58.690
It's all automated now.

16:00.693 --> 16:03.127
We live our lives
pretty much just like you

16:03.129 --> 16:06.631
except our diet's
a little different.

16:06.633 --> 16:09.100
Yes, and one could say
it's even kinder

16:09.102 --> 16:12.603
because we accept
blood donations.

16:12.605 --> 16:15.540
So there isn't any killing
of any people anymore.

16:15.542 --> 16:18.076
So you don't bite people
on the necks?

16:18.078 --> 16:20.445
[both laughing]

16:20.447 --> 16:24.048
Uh, please,
by all means, begin eating.

16:24.050 --> 16:27.485
To answer your question, no, we
do not bite people on the necks.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.253
Not at all.

16:29.255 --> 16:33.658
Um... there's no need.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.693
As you are aware,
blood is donated freely

16:35.695 --> 16:38.262
from numerous sources
around the world.

16:38.264 --> 16:40.298
Wow, this food is really good.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.367
Elle's a good cook, isn't she?

16:42.369 --> 16:44.502
I've had many years
to perfect it.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.637
Exactly how many years
would that be?

16:46.639 --> 16:48.306
If you're trying to figure out

16:48.308 --> 16:51.142
how old I am, let me remind you,
it's considered rude

16:51.144 --> 16:53.411
to ask a woman's age,
regardless of species.

16:54.313 --> 16:55.580
Point taken.

16:55.582 --> 16:57.415
Alrighty then,
as guests in the house

16:57.417 --> 17:00.485
I've to run a few rules
by you, if you don't mind.

17:00.487 --> 17:01.519
Okay.

17:01.521 --> 17:04.689
First, um...

17:04.691 --> 17:07.125
there can't be any filming
of our, uh, rituals

17:07.127 --> 17:10.028
our ceremonies.

17:10.030 --> 17:12.597
Well, in order for us
to completely capture

17:12.598 --> 17:14.098
your lifestyle,
we've to have...

17:14.099 --> 17:15.233
No, no, no.

17:15.234 --> 17:17.602
No cameras, no filming...

17:17.604 --> 17:19.069
of ceremonies.

17:19.071 --> 17:20.505
Okay.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.339
Second of all,
we can't allow you

17:22.342 --> 17:24.041
to go down into the basement.

17:24.044 --> 17:26.109
You can freely run around
in the house

17:26.112 --> 17:28.546
but the basement is off limits.

17:28.548 --> 17:31.549
There's a lot of old heirlooms
down there that, uh

17:31.551 --> 17:34.185
we don't wanna see
anything happen to...

17:34.187 --> 17:35.586
- That understood?
- Absolutely.

17:35.588 --> 17:38.089
Understood. We understand.

17:38.091 --> 17:39.724
And finally, um

17:39.726 --> 17:43.628
you can't, uh, disturb us during
the day when we're sleeping.

17:43.630 --> 17:46.798
Yep. It's absolutely essential
that we rest during those hours

17:46.800 --> 17:48.433
so that
we can function properly.

17:48.435 --> 17:52.737
- It's essential.
- With no exceptions.

17:52.739 --> 17:55.640
Okay, well,
as guests of your house

17:55.642 --> 17:57.775
we will follow
all of your rules.

17:58.777 --> 18:00.378
Alrighty then.

18:00.380 --> 18:03.414
So after we eat, what do we do?

18:06.318 --> 18:08.419
Okay, just be careful
not to hit it.

18:12.157 --> 18:15.159
- Is it on properly?
- Yeah, just try not to hit it.

18:15.161 --> 18:17.128
- Okay.
- I think we're good.

18:19.364 --> 18:22.300
- Fire away, Mike.
- Great.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.135
Um, could you please start

18:24.137 --> 18:26.471
by stating your name
for the camera?

18:26.473 --> 18:29.774
Uh, my name is Andrew Pritchard.

18:29.776 --> 18:32.844
And what do you do for a living?

18:32.846 --> 18:34.579
Uh, venture.

18:34.581 --> 18:36.681
Uh, I'm sorry,
could you please state it

18:36.683 --> 18:39.150
as a, "I work as..."

18:39.152 --> 18:43.254
Oh, I work
as a venture capitalist.

18:43.256 --> 18:44.822
From the outside perspective

18:44.824 --> 18:48.326
you seem like
an ordinary, ambitious guy.

18:48.328 --> 18:50.294
Sometimes I get a little lazy.

18:50.296 --> 18:52.630
But let's get
to the heart of the matter.

18:52.632 --> 18:56.234
You are a vampire?

18:56.236 --> 18:59.804
What defines me as being a
vampire is that I need albumen.

18:59.806 --> 19:02.740
That's a protein plasma
that's found in blood.

19:02.742 --> 19:05.910
That's my food. That's what
keeps me functioning.

19:05.912 --> 19:07.778
Do you have fangs?

19:07.780 --> 19:11.249
[chuckles]
Do I look like I have fangs?

19:11.251 --> 19:15.753
Well, what happens
if you touch a cross?

19:15.755 --> 19:17.788
Oh, I start to get
a tingling feeling

19:17.790 --> 19:20.291
that I can't control it.

19:20.293 --> 19:23.661
No, nothing.
Nothing happens in particular.

19:23.663 --> 19:26.264
Would a stake to the heart
kill you?

19:26.266 --> 19:29.834
Well, wouldn't
a stake to the heart kill you?

19:29.836 --> 19:31.536
<i>[Mike]
What about holy water?</i>

19:32.871 --> 19:34.205
Nope.

19:35.207 --> 19:36.874
Sunlight?

19:36.876 --> 19:39.277
Sunlight,
sunlight is a different matter.

19:39.279 --> 19:41.212
Yes, uh,
due to our genetic makeup

19:41.214 --> 19:42.880
we suffer
from exposure to sunlight

19:42.882 --> 19:47.185
because we have a condition
known as cutaneous porphyria

19:47.187 --> 19:50.288
which is where, if we are
exposed to direct sunlight

19:50.290 --> 19:55.493
our skin blisters and burns.

19:55.495 --> 19:58.729
So you're saying that
every myth about vampires

19:58.731 --> 20:01.399
can be explained medically?

20:01.401 --> 20:05.369
Modern science can explain
all of our medical conditions.

20:05.371 --> 20:08.906
And if you go back in time
when people thought to be crazed

20:08.908 --> 20:12.977
or out of their minds, lunatic,
for example...

20:12.979 --> 20:18.883
uh, they were characterized
as being possessed by the devil.

20:18.885 --> 20:22.853
- We don't believe that today.
- How old are you, Andrew?

20:22.855 --> 20:26.257
I'm 147 years old.

20:26.259 --> 20:28.526
How is this possible?

20:28.528 --> 20:32.496
Well, the blood that we require
regenerates our cells.

20:32.498 --> 20:34.932
But can you explain, uh, uh

20:34.934 --> 20:37.602
how it-it's possible for your...

20:37.604 --> 20:41.539
Uh, we-we should just move on
from that one.

20:41.541 --> 20:42.873
We, well, um...

20:42.875 --> 20:45.843
<i>- I mean, is it possi...
- Just move on.</i>

20:45.845 --> 20:47.678
Okay.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.982
Oh, you know, I got a meeting
that that I've got to keep.

20:50.984 --> 20:53.818
I've got to make a living
like you said, right?

20:53.820 --> 20:56.821
So maybe
we could come back to that

20:56.823 --> 20:58.923
at a future time.

21:03.428 --> 21:04.729
Sorry.

21:06.798 --> 21:09.300
Uh-uh, okay,
wh-wh-wh-what just happened?

21:12.304 --> 21:14.639
Right. I'm so excited.
How's my hair?

21:14.641 --> 21:17.275
Can you try not to move
while I'm doing this?

21:17.277 --> 21:19.410
<i>[Blake]
Oh, sorry.</i>

21:19.412 --> 21:23.281
<i>- Uh, uh, Benny, right? Oh. Cool.
- Yeah.</i>

21:23.283 --> 21:26.350
<i>- Hey, uh, how close are you?
- Uh, it's about till here.</i>

21:26.352 --> 21:28.653
Okay. So I could move around
a little bit?

21:28.655 --> 21:30.721
<i>- Yeah.
- Okay. I think we're good.</i>

21:30.723 --> 21:31.956
Okay.

21:31.958 --> 21:34.358
Alright, uh, are you ready?

21:38.297 --> 21:39.764
I was born ready.

21:41.433 --> 21:42.700
Okay, can you please start

21:42.702 --> 21:45.603
by stating your name
for the camera?

21:45.605 --> 21:47.538
Uh...

21:47.540 --> 21:51.842
I'm Blake Theodore Slosser I.

21:51.844 --> 21:54.712
And can you state your age
for the camera?

21:54.714 --> 21:57.915
I'm 111 years old, bro.

21:57.917 --> 22:00.384
Tell me about yourself.

22:00.386 --> 22:04.088
Well, uh, I like living in the
fast lane. You know what I mean?

22:04.090 --> 22:07.892
I, uh, feel like, as a vampire,
you know, I can, um

22:07.894 --> 22:09.694
I can live the party lifestyle

22:09.696 --> 22:13.664
without any of the consequences
humans would have.

22:13.666 --> 22:17.101
Well, how long have you been
living your life like this?

22:17.103 --> 22:20.404
Well, probably, ever since I
turned, I think, late 20s.

22:20.406 --> 22:22.440
You see, I-I came
from a poor family.

22:22.442 --> 22:25.710
Didn't have a lot of money,
so I used to make a habit

22:25.712 --> 22:28.546
of stealing food and
one day it caught up to me.

22:28.548 --> 22:30.481
They threw me in jail.

22:30.483 --> 22:33.651
You know,
they sentenced me to hard labor

22:33.653 --> 22:36.454
from a child into adulthood.

22:36.456 --> 22:38.723
I mean, it was miserable.

22:38.725 --> 22:40.558
I didn't get to feel like

22:40.560 --> 22:43.094
what it was like to be free,
to-to have fun.

22:43.096 --> 22:47.365
Uh, and top of it all,
there was this warden who...

22:47.367 --> 22:48.966
He really didn't like me.

22:48.968 --> 22:52.937
So he literally punished me
every chance he got.

22:52.939 --> 22:56.540
I mean, one day
he beat me so bad...

22:56.542 --> 22:58.642
I mean, I was on my death bed.

23:00.479 --> 23:02.780
That was the day
that I met Andrew

23:02.782 --> 23:06.550
and that was the day he made me
an offer that I couldn't refuse.

23:07.786 --> 23:09.954
What was the first thing
that you did

23:09.956 --> 23:12.923
when you became a vampire?

23:12.925 --> 23:15.559
[laughs]
Mike, that's a good question.

23:15.561 --> 23:18.095
First thing I did was I opened

23:18.097 --> 23:21.499
a can of good, old-fashion
whoop-ass on that warden.

23:21.501 --> 23:23.934
I'm talking about,
I ripped him from limb to limb.

23:23.936 --> 23:26.804
He was begging, begging in ways
I never even imagined possible.

23:26.806 --> 23:28.539
Sweet revenge!

23:30.942 --> 23:32.810
Oh, man.

23:32.812 --> 23:36.580
I was dancin' on his heart,
it was still beatin'.

23:36.582 --> 23:40.484
Refused to even drink his blood.
Such a bastard!

23:40.486 --> 23:44.455
Um, and did you tell
your family?

23:44.457 --> 23:46.924
Uh, I just came here

23:46.926 --> 23:49.827
and, like, this is my family,
you know?

23:51.696 --> 23:53.664
It sounds like quite the life.

23:55.467 --> 23:57.668
Oh, shit, it is now!

23:57.670 --> 24:01.906
Have you ever killed anyone
that you've never met?

24:01.908 --> 24:03.741
Oh, yeah.
Lots of times, I-I...

24:03.743 --> 24:05.075
<i>[Andrew clears throat]</i>

24:12.484 --> 24:16.720
But you know, um,
not so much anymore.

24:16.722 --> 24:20.691
I see. Uh, do you miss it?

24:20.693 --> 24:22.660
Well, yeah.
I mean, I miss it...

24:26.832 --> 24:31.235
But you know, we... we evolve.

24:31.237 --> 24:32.803
And shit like that.

24:37.075 --> 24:39.610
Well, uh, thank you.

24:43.949 --> 24:45.483
We're done?

24:45.485 --> 24:47.151
<i>[Mike]
Look, we'll do some more later</i>

24:47.153 --> 24:49.653
<i>but that's it for now.</i>

24:49.655 --> 24:53.958
Okay. Well... how do I look?

24:53.960 --> 24:56.193
<i>- Good.
- Yeah. Cool.</i>

24:56.195 --> 24:58.128
N- no,
you're not listening to me.

24:58.130 --> 25:01.599
Can't you stop that interview?
How am I supposed to do my job?

25:01.601 --> 25:02.833
That's the whole point, right?

25:02.835 --> 25:04.134
We're here to interview them

25:04.136 --> 25:05.569
then they stop it short?

25:05.571 --> 25:07.571
<i>[Benny]
Yeah, I don't...</i>

25:07.573 --> 25:09.106
<i>- Where, where's Carrie?
- Uh...</i>

25:09.108 --> 25:10.708
Is she in the bathroom?

25:10.710 --> 25:12.676
<i>- What?
- Benny, put...</i>

25:12.678 --> 25:14.545
Okay,
put the fucking camera down.

25:14.547 --> 25:16.280
We're waiting for, um

25:16.282 --> 25:18.816
the-the, that weird,
that weird...

25:18.818 --> 25:20.618
<i>- That weird, what, Selvin...
- Yeah.</i>

25:20.620 --> 25:22.987
I don't know.
Put, put the camera down, Benny.

25:26.691 --> 25:28.125
[humming]

25:31.763 --> 25:33.697
- Ah! What the fuck?
- Ooh, ooh, ooh!

25:33.699 --> 25:35.766
Oh, Selvin. Sorry.

25:35.768 --> 25:39.570
He's not quite used
to this stuff.

25:39.572 --> 25:42.239
- Should we do this another time?
- No, he needs a minute.

25:42.241 --> 25:44.542
Okay, just remember
what we talked about.

25:45.677 --> 25:48.245
[groaning]

25:50.215 --> 25:51.615
Okay.

25:52.183 --> 25:55.185
Okay. Okay.

25:55.187 --> 25:57.021
He's ready.

25:57.023 --> 25:59.189
<i>[Carrie]
Okay. Good.</i>

26:05.030 --> 26:06.664
We're good.

26:09.834 --> 26:11.936
Okay.

26:11.938 --> 26:15.005
Could you please state your name
for the camera?

26:17.776 --> 26:21.879
Marten Selvin Trask.

26:23.882 --> 26:25.849
<i>- Marten...
- Now it's Selvin.</i>

26:27.118 --> 26:28.652
Selvin...

26:29.988 --> 26:31.789
can you tell us your age?

26:34.626 --> 26:36.193
<i>[Elleanor]
Go ahead.</i>

26:38.363 --> 26:40.598
Can you tell us
what you do remember?

26:43.969 --> 26:45.102
Darkness.

26:46.905 --> 26:50.741
<i>- Infinite black darkness!
- Hold! Okay! O-okay! Okay!</i>

26:50.743 --> 26:54.178
[Elleanor]
Whoa! Alright. Okay. Just...

26:54.180 --> 26:57.982
<i>- Could you just turn that off?
- Okay. It's off.</i>

26:57.984 --> 27:00.017
Okay. Okay.

27:00.019 --> 27:02.252
<i>[Elleanor] Okay, obviously,
we need to get some air.</i>

27:02.254 --> 27:04.888
This isn't gonna work.
We're gonna take a break.

27:04.890 --> 27:07.625
<i>[Elleanor]
Come on. Come on.</i>

27:09.060 --> 27:10.761
[sighs]

27:13.164 --> 27:16.000
[laughing]
Sorry, but, uh, you know

27:16.002 --> 27:19.870
Selvin, he was, he was trapped
in a concrete dungeon for years

27:19.872 --> 27:23.140
and, uh, he wasn't, like,
exposed to any, like

27:23.142 --> 27:25.376
light or interaction,
so he went a little mad

27:25.378 --> 27:28.412
but, uh, he's getting better,
it's a process.

27:28.414 --> 27:31.415
Well, how did he survive
while he was trapped?

27:31.417 --> 27:33.917
The dude mainly fed on rats.

27:33.919 --> 27:35.953
That's terrible.
That's disgusting.

27:35.955 --> 27:38.856
- How long was he down there?
- Over 30 years.

27:38.858 --> 27:41.158
<i>- Holy cow! Thirty years?
- That's what he said, Benny.</i>

27:41.160 --> 27:42.993
Yeah, that's what I said,
but imagine

27:42.995 --> 27:44.428
what that'd do
to your mind.

27:44.430 --> 27:46.864
Like, he was this close
to becoming a dweller.

27:46.866 --> 27:48.432
- I'm sorry, dweller?
- Yeah.

27:48.434 --> 27:51.201
Uh, a, a dweller, it's when, um

27:51.203 --> 27:53.270
a vampire doesn't get
enough blood

27:53.272 --> 27:56.740
they go absolutely mad
and turn into rabid animals.

27:56.742 --> 27:59.176
How did he end up there
in the first place?

27:59.178 --> 28:01.412
Uh, some villagers
chased him there and some shit.

28:01.414 --> 28:03.847
I don't really remember,
but what I do know

28:03.849 --> 28:05.683
is when he got loose,
he single-handedly

28:05.685 --> 28:08.318
went to that village
and tore the shit out of it.

28:08.320 --> 28:09.720
He fuckin' killed everyone.

28:09.722 --> 28:11.822
But, listen,
you guys cannot tell Andrew

28:11.824 --> 28:14.892
that I told you any of this
shit. I'll get in trouble.

28:14.894 --> 28:15.926
- Cool?
- Yeah.

28:15.928 --> 28:17.227
- Yeah.
- Pinky swear?

28:18.430 --> 28:19.963
Yeah.

28:19.965 --> 28:22.366
That's some old-school shit
that we used to do.

28:22.368 --> 28:25.736
Okay, um, can you please start
by stating your name

28:25.738 --> 28:27.471
for the camera?

28:27.473 --> 28:31.308
My name is Elleanor Theona Gray.

28:31.310 --> 28:33.944
And can you state your age,
please?

28:33.946 --> 28:36.447
I've told you I don't wish
to discuss that topic.

28:36.449 --> 28:41.151
Okay. Did Andrew infect you?

28:41.153 --> 28:44.321
Yes, he drained my blood
and infected me with his own

28:44.323 --> 28:46.957
but not for the reasons
that you might think.

28:46.959 --> 28:49.226
I contracted
a severe case of polio.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.462
I was dying
when Andrew gave me the choice

28:51.464 --> 28:54.064
to live or die, so I chose life.

28:54.066 --> 28:55.866
Through vampirism?

28:55.868 --> 28:58.836
Did you know what you were being
offered at the time?

28:58.838 --> 29:00.504
Please understand.

29:00.506 --> 29:03.240
I had a sickly mother
who needed my help.

29:03.242 --> 29:05.476
I didn't want to leave her.

29:05.478 --> 29:08.812
Andrew gave me the greatest gift
that anybody ever could.

29:08.814 --> 29:12.483
So we fell in love
and I married him.

29:12.485 --> 29:14.752
So after you became a vampire

29:14.754 --> 29:17.020
your, your feelings,
they never changed?

29:17.022 --> 29:19.289
No, the misconception
that we turn

29:19.291 --> 29:23.327
into mindless, bloodthirsty
beasts is ridiculous.

29:23.329 --> 29:26.163
My family means as much to me
now as it did

29:26.165 --> 29:27.931
before I was changed.

29:27.933 --> 29:31.435
We need blood, it's what
our bodies require to survive.

29:31.437 --> 29:34.938
It is a small price to pay
for what we get to experience.

29:34.940 --> 29:36.340
And what is that?

29:36.342 --> 29:39.176
We never
have to see ourselves age.

29:39.178 --> 29:43.847
We can watch life and time go by
as coaches change.

29:43.849 --> 29:45.916
And what are the down sides?

29:45.918 --> 29:47.918
Watching those that you love
age ungracefully

29:47.920 --> 29:50.087
and die around you.

29:50.089 --> 29:53.190
I'd say
that's the hardest part for me.

29:53.192 --> 29:55.425
<i>[Benny] Can you imagine
being trapped for 30 years?</i>

29:55.427 --> 29:58.228
<i>- In complete darkness?
- I know, it's crazy.</i>

29:58.230 --> 30:01.298
Can you put down that camera
and help us with the gear?

30:01.300 --> 30:03.934
I tell you, that guy
scared the shit outta me.

30:03.936 --> 30:05.135
[screaming]

30:06.838 --> 30:08.505
What? What was it?

30:08.507 --> 30:10.908
I just saw something outside.

30:10.910 --> 30:12.543
<i>- Are you sure?
- I saw it too.</i>

30:12.545 --> 30:14.144
Yes.

30:25.156 --> 30:26.490
There's nothing there now.

30:29.294 --> 30:31.895
I don't know
if I feel like sleeping now.

30:31.897 --> 30:34.598
Hey, listen, I'm not gonna
let anything happen to you.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.934
- Alright?
- Okay. Nice try.

30:39.137 --> 30:40.437
[door opens]

30:48.613 --> 30:51.114
<i>- Selvin! Selvin!
- Yeah?</i>

30:51.116 --> 30:52.916
<i>[Andrew]
Get your ass out here.</i>

30:54.118 --> 30:55.919
[whispering]
What are you doing?

30:59.490 --> 31:02.125
<i>- What the fuck was that?
- Ah.</i>

31:02.127 --> 31:04.394
<i>[Benny] Okay, that was seriously creepy.</i>

31:04.396 --> 31:06.430
What just happened?

31:06.432 --> 31:08.365
<i>[Mike]
You were asleep the whole time?</i>

31:08.367 --> 31:10.200
Yeah, I woke up because I felt

31:10.202 --> 31:12.069
my life was in danger
or something.

31:12.071 --> 31:13.904
<i>[Benny]
That's not far from the truth.</i>

31:13.906 --> 31:16.406
<i>- Shut up, Benny.
- What?</i>

31:16.408 --> 31:19.409
Hey, was this thing running
the whole time?

31:19.411 --> 31:20.944
<i>[Benny]
Yeah.</i>

31:20.946 --> 31:23.380
Oh, good. That means we can...

31:23.382 --> 31:25.883
<i>[Benny]
It is now officially day two.</i>

31:25.885 --> 31:28.886
<i>And this morning
was a little awkward.</i>

31:28.888 --> 31:30.187
God, what time is it?

31:30.189 --> 31:33.290
Hm. It's, um, 7:30.

31:33.292 --> 31:36.360
I'd be sleeping if you guys
didn't tell me about last night.

31:36.362 --> 31:39.029
<i>- It scared the shit outta me.
- It was freaky.</i>

31:39.031 --> 31:40.931
<i>Everyone seems to be asleep
now, though.</i>

31:40.933 --> 31:44.468
Why don't you put that down
and grab yourself a bowl?

31:44.470 --> 31:46.370
<i>[Benny] I'm good. I never eat breakfast.</i>

31:46.372 --> 31:49.006
You're gonna bitch to me
I didn't let you eat.

31:49.008 --> 31:51.275
Are you seriously filming us
when we're eating cereal?

31:51.277 --> 31:53.510
<i>[Benny] Yeah. You never
know what you're gonna get.</i>

31:53.512 --> 31:55.412
<i>Think of what we caught
last night.</i>

31:55.414 --> 31:57.915
Hm, that reminds me...

31:57.917 --> 31:59.316
First order of business today

31:59.318 --> 32:01.351
I wanna set up cameras
around the house.

32:01.353 --> 32:04.321
- You think Andrew'll be cool?
- Andrew's not gonna know.

32:04.323 --> 32:06.556
You're gonna patch those in
through your phone app.

32:06.558 --> 32:09.393
Also, I wanna try to get down
to that, uh...

32:09.395 --> 32:13.196
<i>- Oh. Carrie, are you okay?
- Hey, hey.</i>

32:13.198 --> 32:15.432
- Lean your head back.
- It's just a nosebleed.

32:15.434 --> 32:17.668
Can you put that down,
help for a second?

32:17.670 --> 32:19.102
<i>- Yeah. Sorry.
- Do you wanna...</i>

32:19.104 --> 32:20.470
<i>Um, is the bag...</i>

32:20.472 --> 32:22.439
<i>Shall I get the bag
from upstairs?</i>

32:24.509 --> 32:27.511
Alright, uh,
all the cameras are set.

32:27.513 --> 32:29.346
Go and check,
see if they're working.

32:29.348 --> 32:32.349
<i>[Benny]
Yeah. Checking. Yeah, man.</i>

32:32.351 --> 32:35.085
<i>Cameras one, two and three
are all set.</i>

32:35.087 --> 32:36.186
[cell phone vibrating]

32:36.188 --> 32:38.155
One second.

32:38.157 --> 32:39.656
Hey, Aaron, what's up?

32:41.259 --> 32:43.994
Yeah, yeah,
I can, I can do that right now.

32:43.996 --> 32:46.263
Okay, bye.

32:46.265 --> 32:48.598
Uh, Aaron wants to do
a video call, so...

32:50.501 --> 32:53.437
[line ringing]

32:53.439 --> 32:57.174
You were supposed to touch base
earlier. What's going on?

32:57.176 --> 32:59.476
Um, yeah,
I was just about to call you.

32:59.478 --> 33:01.445
- Where's Carrie?
- She's not feeling well.

33:01.447 --> 33:03.680
- So she's resting.
- How's everything else going?

33:05.416 --> 33:08.151
Well, at first,
they seemed kind of ordinary.

33:08.153 --> 33:09.720
You haven't seen
anything strange?

33:12.256 --> 33:15.359
I'm still not completely sold
on the whole vampire thing.

33:15.361 --> 33:17.227
Yeah,
that's what I thought at first

33:17.229 --> 33:20.497
but now we've seen
a couple of strange things.

33:20.499 --> 33:23.333
One of the family members
came into our room this morning

33:23.335 --> 33:26.603
and he was sniffing Carrie.

33:26.605 --> 33:28.505
Sniffing Carrie?

33:30.775 --> 33:32.542
That doesn't mean he's a vampire

33:32.544 --> 33:34.378
that just means he's a pervert!

33:34.380 --> 33:36.013
I'm not ready to leave yet.

33:36.015 --> 33:37.781
I think
there's something off about...

33:37.783 --> 33:40.183
Benny, why the hell
are you filming this?

33:40.185 --> 33:43.153
Just try and make an effort

33:43.155 --> 33:46.123
to come up with
something newsworthy, please.

33:46.125 --> 33:47.657
- Will do.
- Thank you.

33:50.361 --> 33:51.728
Bye.

33:53.531 --> 33:56.166
<i>[Benny]
So what do you think?</i>

33:56.168 --> 33:59.302
Well, for starters I-I think
we should be sleeping during

33:59.304 --> 34:02.606
the daytime so that we can be
awake at night when they are.

34:02.608 --> 34:04.274
<i>Considering what happened
this morning</i>

34:04.276 --> 34:06.109
<i>and the fact
we got little sleep.</i>

34:06.111 --> 34:07.611
<i>- I'm going back to bed.
- Yeah.</i>

34:07.613 --> 34:10.112
Hey, guys. Ho!

34:10.114 --> 34:12.482
I scared the shit outta him.
Did you see?

34:12.484 --> 34:15.752
No, it just felt like you were
supposed to be, well, you know?

34:15.754 --> 34:17.587
Oh, because it's daytime?
No, no, no.

34:17.589 --> 34:20.056
I built up a resistance
to indirect sunlight

34:20.059 --> 34:22.292
but I did hear
what the bossman was talking.

34:22.293 --> 34:24.127
Sounds like
he's skeptical of us, huh?

34:24.129 --> 34:26.362
I think it's difficult
for Aaron because he's not...

34:26.364 --> 34:29.433
Okay, no, no, no, cool, 'cause
I wanna show you guys somethin'.

34:29.435 --> 34:31.501
Come over here. Come on.

34:31.503 --> 34:33.637
Okay. Now are you ready?

34:33.639 --> 34:36.572
'Cause this is gonna
blow your mind, okay?

34:36.574 --> 34:38.341
<i>- This thing's recording?
- Yeah. It's on.</i>

34:38.342 --> 34:41.445
Come here, come here.
Focus on my arm. Okay?

34:41.447 --> 34:43.480
Alright. Here goes nothin'.

34:45.315 --> 34:48.150
Oh! Whoo-hoo!

34:48.152 --> 34:49.386
<i>[Benny]
Gettin' it. Gettin' it.</i>

34:49.388 --> 34:50.620
Oh.

34:52.456 --> 34:55.725
Check that out.
Oh, crispy fried arm.

34:55.726 --> 34:57.360
Go ahead and touch it, bossman.

34:59.363 --> 35:01.331
- Oh!
- It's cold.

35:01.333 --> 35:02.866
Yeah, it's kinda trip, huh?

35:02.868 --> 35:05.102
Uh, did you get that?
You wanna try?

35:05.104 --> 35:07.137
<i>- I'm good. Thanks.
- Okay, but you got it.</i>

35:07.139 --> 35:08.605
<i>- You got it, right?
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

35:08.607 --> 35:10.674
Okay. Cool.

35:10.676 --> 35:12.843
Cool, well, um...
What do you guys think?

35:12.845 --> 35:15.712
You wanna do another interview?
'Cause we got this now.

35:15.714 --> 35:19.483
Ah, w-we'll do a second round
throughout the week, so...

35:19.485 --> 35:21.318
Okay, but you know,
everybody's asleep now.

35:21.320 --> 35:23.487
I mean,
we can totally pop one off.

35:23.489 --> 35:26.189
Yeah, um, we-we have to properly
set up the equipment

35:26.191 --> 35:27.491
script out some more questions

35:27.493 --> 35:29.426
so we're kinda not ready.

35:29.428 --> 35:32.129
Okay. Well, then, um...

35:32.131 --> 35:33.763
I'll go get me some shut-eye.

35:33.765 --> 35:36.133
- Okay?
- Alright, sleep well.

35:36.135 --> 35:37.367
What do you guys think?

35:37.369 --> 35:38.568
You think this-this footage

35:38.570 --> 35:40.203
is interesting enough
for your bossman?

35:40.205 --> 35:42.639
I don't want you guys
to leave yet, you know?

35:42.641 --> 35:45.242
Ah, absolutely.

35:45.244 --> 35:47.277
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

35:47.279 --> 35:49.846
Alright. Cool, cool.

35:49.848 --> 35:51.414
Well, uh, I'm out.

35:51.416 --> 35:53.416
<i>[Benny]
Have a good one.</i>

35:54.819 --> 35:56.620
Peace out.

35:59.724 --> 36:01.358
Oh, my God! You believe that?

36:01.360 --> 36:03.393
<i>This footage
is gonna be amazing.</i>

36:03.395 --> 36:04.728
You better have captured that.

36:04.730 --> 36:06.596
<i>Trust me, I got it.</i>

36:06.598 --> 36:09.599
<i>What was he doing up anyway?</i>

36:09.601 --> 36:11.434
I don't know,
we know they're awake

36:11.436 --> 36:13.170
at night and during the day.

36:15.473 --> 36:18.308
<i>[Benny] Guys, wake up. It's almost 6:00.</i>

36:20.611 --> 36:23.513
Ah... Shit.
We slept a long fuckin' time.

36:23.515 --> 36:26.249
Benny, uh, why didn't you
get us up earlier?

36:26.251 --> 36:27.851
<i>Man, I dozed off.</i>

36:27.853 --> 36:30.253
Can't you do anything right?

36:30.255 --> 36:31.388
Carrie.

36:32.723 --> 36:34.758
Carrie, come on,
it's time to get up.

36:34.760 --> 36:37.928
Um, I don't feel good.

36:37.930 --> 36:40.397
<i>Mike, what's wrong with her?</i>

36:40.399 --> 36:42.766
How the hell should I know?

36:42.768 --> 36:44.601
Hey, what's going on?

36:44.603 --> 36:46.503
[indistinct chatter]

36:46.505 --> 36:48.805
<i>Dude, look at her.
She's all pale.</i>

36:48.807 --> 36:50.407
Yeah, she felt really cold.

36:50.409 --> 36:52.509
<i>Mike, check her neck
for bite marks.</i>

36:56.981 --> 37:00.684
No, no, there's nothing. Benny.

37:00.686 --> 37:04.354
Hey. Hey, how are you feelin'?

37:04.356 --> 37:06.690
Not fucking good, Mike.

37:06.692 --> 37:09.826
<i>Maybe I can find
some aspirin downstairs.</i>

37:09.828 --> 37:11.728
Yeah, look, uh,
I'm coming with you

37:11.730 --> 37:14.965
so that you won't give her
anything else fucked up.

37:14.967 --> 37:17.400
<i>[Benny] You know, I can
do some things right.</i>

37:31.349 --> 37:32.782
You wanna put down that camera

37:32.784 --> 37:34.818
and help me look for medicine
for Carrie?

37:36.454 --> 37:38.688
<i>- Good evening.
- Ah.</i>

37:38.690 --> 37:40.523
Sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you.

37:40.525 --> 37:43.560
No, it's just fright.
You just took us by surprise.

37:43.562 --> 37:46.029
<i>- Evening, Benny.
- Hi, Elle.</i>

37:46.031 --> 37:47.697
Anything I can help you find?

37:47.699 --> 37:49.933
We're just trying
to find some aspirin for Carrie.

37:49.935 --> 37:52.869
- She's not feeling so well.
- Oh, sorry to hear.

37:52.871 --> 37:54.704
Uh, let me see what we have.

37:57.341 --> 37:59.042
<i>- Good evening, fellas.
- Good evening.</i>

37:59.044 --> 38:01.978
Andrew dear, Mike says
Carrie isn't feeling so good.

38:01.980 --> 38:03.613
- No, no.
- Ah.

38:03.615 --> 38:05.682
Do you know
if we have any aspirin?

38:05.684 --> 38:07.917
I don't know.
Look in the medicine cabinet.

38:07.919 --> 38:10.787
Mm-hmm. Oh!

38:10.789 --> 38:13.390
- Not much use for it.
- Here we are.

38:13.392 --> 38:15.825
Oh, here it is. Thank you.

38:15.827 --> 38:18.328
She finds everything.

38:18.330 --> 38:19.629
Did you guys sleep well?

38:19.631 --> 38:21.898
Actually, yeah, we slept fine.

38:21.900 --> 38:23.900
- Glad to hear.
- You know, I can't...

38:23.902 --> 38:25.602
I've got to tell you that

38:25.604 --> 38:28.972
we are expecting, uh,
additional guests later tonight.

38:28.974 --> 38:31.741
Oh, I-I didn't know that
anyone else was, was coming.

38:31.743 --> 38:34.878
Yeah, it's our sectional leader.

38:34.880 --> 38:36.479
He's paying us a visit.

38:36.481 --> 38:38.915
It's actually considered
quite an honor.

38:38.917 --> 38:41.351
I'd ask you
to be on your best behavior.

38:41.353 --> 38:43.320
Yeah, yeah, of course.

38:43.322 --> 38:46.022
And he'd also, he'd like to
contribute to the documentary.

38:46.024 --> 38:47.657
Oh. Well, great.

38:47.659 --> 38:50.660
I- I'm sure we'll get
some, some great footage.

38:50.662 --> 38:54.097
I- I should probably get this up
to Carrie, so thank you.

38:54.099 --> 38:55.598
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Oh.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.434
Dinner'll be ready
in half an hour.

38:57.436 --> 38:59.636
<i>- Cool. Thanks.
- Great, we-we'll see you then.</i>

38:59.638 --> 39:01.104
Thank you...

39:03.774 --> 39:06.776
Benny, if you don't shut
that camera off right now...

39:06.778 --> 39:10.480
<i>[Benny]
Mike, someone's at the door.</i>

39:10.482 --> 39:12.916
- Hey.
- Hey, guys.

39:12.918 --> 39:15.552
So Andrew wanted me to let you
know Samuel's here.

39:15.554 --> 39:17.787
Oh, uh, we'll be right down.

39:17.789 --> 39:20.023
- Okay.
- Cool.

39:20.825 --> 39:22.025
Okay.

39:26.564 --> 39:28.465
<i>- Alright, let's go do this.
- Wait.</i>

39:28.467 --> 39:31.067
<i>[Benny]
You have your micro cam on?</i>

39:31.069 --> 39:32.669
Yup. All set.

39:40.511 --> 39:44.481
Gentlemen, this is Samuel.

39:44.483 --> 39:47.417
Our sectional group leader.

39:47.419 --> 39:49.586
The one I told you
was coming tonight.

39:49.588 --> 39:51.654
Sam. Nice to meet you.
I'm Mike.

39:51.656 --> 39:52.956
Samuel, please.

39:52.958 --> 39:55.592
Yes, of course, uh, Samuel.
I'm sorry.

39:55.594 --> 39:57.627
So you're the one
that broke the story

39:57.629 --> 39:59.763
about the blood donation
facilities?

39:59.765 --> 40:03.666
Yes, I happened to,
to stumble upon that.

40:03.668 --> 40:07.737
I see. Well, you should know.
I requested you personally.

40:07.739 --> 40:11.040
I wanted to see if you are
as good as your reputation.

40:11.042 --> 40:13.042
Oh, I guess we'll find out.

40:13.044 --> 40:15.645
Oh, this is Benny.
He's operating the camera.

40:15.647 --> 40:17.046
<i>- Benny.
- Hi there.</i>

40:17.048 --> 40:20.483
Come on, gentlemen.
We're gonna leave you ladies.

40:20.485 --> 40:23.753
We have to pre, continue to
prepare for tonight's ceremony.

40:23.755 --> 40:27.757
- Samuel.
- Thank you, Andrew.

40:27.759 --> 40:30.460
Um, this is my daughter,
Rebecca.

40:30.462 --> 40:33.563
Oh, Rebecca. Nice to meet you.

40:33.565 --> 40:34.864
Come.

40:34.866 --> 40:36.666
<i>[Benny]
Hi. Nice to meet you.</i>

40:36.668 --> 40:40.470
And this is my other daughter,
Sybil.

40:40.472 --> 40:43.706
Sybil, it's a pleasure
to meet you, as well.

40:43.708 --> 40:44.941
How dare you address me?

40:44.943 --> 40:47.877
- You're nothing more than prey.
- Sybil.

40:47.879 --> 40:50.547
We feed on pitiful bloodsacks
like you. Nothing more.

40:50.549 --> 40:54.684
<i>(man speaking
foreign language)</i>

41:04.195 --> 41:05.995
I apologize
for my daughter's behavior.

41:05.997 --> 41:09.065
She is still adjusting
to the changing times.

41:09.067 --> 41:10.834
Yeah, it's okay.

41:12.603 --> 41:14.971
You know... kids.

41:16.240 --> 41:17.807
[clears throat]

41:20.978 --> 41:25.615
Can you tell us a brief history
about yourself?

41:25.617 --> 41:28.952
Okay, I, uh...

41:28.954 --> 41:31.020
I was raised in England

41:31.022 --> 41:34.891
and I came over to the States
in the early 17th century.

41:34.893 --> 41:36.626
How did you become a vampire?

41:38.729 --> 41:41.664
Direct into the point, I see.

41:41.666 --> 41:44.634
I was turned by an elder.

41:44.636 --> 41:47.070
If an elder were to die

41:47.072 --> 41:49.572
would you be affected by that?

41:51.509 --> 41:53.710
Well, since we're all connected

41:53.712 --> 41:58.081
um, we would feel
tremendous physical pain. Yes.

41:58.083 --> 42:01.584
- Would you change back?
- No.

42:01.586 --> 42:05.288
No, no, once the virus is in
your bloodstream, it's there.

42:05.290 --> 42:07.524
There's no way to get rid of it.

42:09.727 --> 42:12.128
Do you know
how vampirism came to be?

42:14.698 --> 42:18.635
That's like asking
how fish came to be.

42:18.637 --> 42:20.603
When I discovered
that blood-donation facilities

42:20.605 --> 42:22.639
were supplying vampires
with their sustenance

42:22.641 --> 42:26.276
it seemed that you had adapted
to new ways.

42:26.278 --> 42:30.246
We have adapted to modern times
and technologies.

42:30.248 --> 42:33.182
It's not typical for us to, uh

42:33.184 --> 42:36.085
go on killing people anymore.

42:36.087 --> 42:37.654
But you used to kill.

42:39.924 --> 42:42.926
Yes, and that was, uh,
unfortunately

42:42.928 --> 42:45.828
part of our history.

42:45.830 --> 42:48.698
How... did you kill?

42:50.935 --> 42:53.770
Whichever was the quickest way
to draw the blood.

42:53.772 --> 42:56.272
Being human,
you wouldn't know about that.

42:56.274 --> 43:00.243
The pain and the hunger
when we have a need to feed.

43:00.245 --> 43:02.111
That's, uh...

43:03.847 --> 43:06.182
It's as if nothing else matters.

43:06.184 --> 43:08.751
It sounds like an addiction.

43:08.753 --> 43:11.754
Hm, of the worst kind.

43:11.756 --> 43:14.290
But as I stated earlier,
we've evolved.

43:14.292 --> 43:17.327
We, uh, we've learned,
over the centuries

43:17.329 --> 43:19.362
to control these urges.

43:22.866 --> 43:25.768
We don't have any hatred
of humans.

43:25.770 --> 43:28.671
We're trying to help society
by doing it a service.

43:30.074 --> 43:32.175
How so?

43:32.177 --> 43:35.878
I think it's better if
I show you rather than explain

43:35.880 --> 43:38.114
but you're gonna need
to turn the cameras off.

43:42.953 --> 43:45.254
Listen, if you wanna see...

43:45.256 --> 43:47.357
you're gonna need
to turn them off.

43:56.934 --> 43:59.202
Well, go ahead.

43:59.204 --> 44:01.170
Alright, shut 'em down.

44:01.172 --> 44:03.106
<i>[Benny]
Yeah. I'm gonna fuck you guys.</i>

44:06.944 --> 44:08.911
[whistling]

44:08.913 --> 44:11.848
[female #1]
Ah! No, let go!

44:11.850 --> 44:13.082
This way, gentleman.

44:13.084 --> 44:16.185
Michael. Benny.

44:16.187 --> 44:17.654
You two stand over there.

44:17.656 --> 44:19.756
[woman sobbing]

44:19.758 --> 44:20.990
<i>[Mike]
Wait.</i>

44:22.292 --> 44:25.995
O- okay, um...
What's going on?

44:25.997 --> 44:27.430
Relax, Michael.

44:27.432 --> 44:28.998
Are you gonna kill her?

44:29.000 --> 44:30.867
We're sacrificing her.

44:30.869 --> 44:32.301
But then you said
you're domesticated

44:32.303 --> 44:33.970
and that you don't kill anymore.

44:33.972 --> 44:37.774
We are domesticated.
She, however, is not.

44:37.776 --> 44:40.910
Well, tonight
we are going to celebrate

44:40.912 --> 44:43.746
our origins in the old way.

44:43.748 --> 44:45.214
We do this ritual yearly

44:45.216 --> 44:48.217
so we don't have to go out
and kill every night.

44:48.219 --> 44:50.353
<i>[Mike]
But how does this help society?</i>

44:50.355 --> 44:52.422
Before you start to pity her
too much

44:52.424 --> 44:54.457
you should know
that she is a prostitute

44:54.459 --> 44:56.693
and infected with HIV

44:56.695 --> 44:58.861
who's been
knowingly infecting others

44:58.863 --> 45:00.830
while satiating the drug use.

45:00.832 --> 45:02.799
- That's not true!
- Shh!

45:02.801 --> 45:04.267
Please don't let them kill me!

45:04.269 --> 45:06.302
We're very selective
about who we choose

45:06.304 --> 45:08.438
to participate
in our ceremonies.

45:08.440 --> 45:11.140
No families or children.

45:11.142 --> 45:12.775
She'll be dead within a year

45:12.777 --> 45:14.711
if left on the streets,
cold, hungry

45:14.713 --> 45:16.212
sick and, uh...

45:16.214 --> 45:17.714
It's an ancient ritual

45:17.716 --> 45:20.883
and no humans
have ever witnessed this before.

45:20.885 --> 45:22.719
Why don't you want us
filming it?

45:22.721 --> 45:24.954
But we don't think
that the general public's ready

45:24.956 --> 45:28.791
to watch this
particular ceremony, Michael.

45:28.793 --> 45:30.426
Well, shall we begin?

45:30.428 --> 45:33.196
My dear,
would you do the honors?

45:33.198 --> 45:35.364
No! No! No!

45:35.366 --> 45:36.733
<i>- Ah!
- Holy shit!</i>

45:36.735 --> 45:38.968
[groaning]

45:38.970 --> 45:42.939
Why are you just watching?
Please, help me!

45:42.941 --> 45:45.241
Andrew.

45:45.243 --> 45:47.944
No, no! Ah!

45:52.116 --> 45:54.083
<i>[Elleanor]
It will be over soon.</i>

45:54.085 --> 45:56.319
Shh!

45:56.321 --> 45:59.388
<i>[Mike] Shouldn't we use a
tranquilizer to help her with the pain?</i>

45:59.390 --> 46:01.758
No, foreign chemical
in her bloodstream

46:01.760 --> 46:03.860
will ruin the ceremony.

46:03.862 --> 46:07.163
- Please, everyone, join in.
- No! No!

46:07.165 --> 46:10.233
No! No! Ah!

46:10.235 --> 46:13.236
[groaning]

46:14.304 --> 46:16.539
Oh, my God! Ah!

46:21.445 --> 46:24.013
<i>[Benny]
Oh, fuck.</i>

46:24.015 --> 46:27.517
Please! I beg you.

46:27.519 --> 46:29.485
Just do something.

46:30.554 --> 46:32.555
<i>- Please!
- Mike!</i>

46:32.557 --> 46:36.259
<i>[Benny] Mike, we have to, we
gotta go. We can't film this.</i>

46:43.567 --> 46:47.203
Oh. Congratulations.

46:47.205 --> 46:49.372
For another fine ceremony.

46:51.241 --> 46:53.509
This may seem monstrous to you

46:53.511 --> 46:55.278
but trust me

46:55.280 --> 46:57.914
we do this to help society

46:57.916 --> 47:00.550
by removing the unwanted.

47:04.321 --> 47:07.356
Right.

47:07.358 --> 47:10.827
<i>[Benny] Why the fuck didn't we
do anything to help that girl?</i>

47:10.829 --> 47:12.461
What do you think
we could've done?

47:12.463 --> 47:14.430
<i>We could've done something!
Anything!</i>

47:14.432 --> 47:16.532
<i>We're just as guilty
as those people!</i>

47:18.402 --> 47:20.303
This is the problem
dealing with inexperienced...

47:20.305 --> 47:22.205
<i>Oh, don't give me
that bullshit, man!</i>

47:22.207 --> 47:24.040
<i>We just watched a girl
get murdered</i>

47:24.042 --> 47:26.175
<i>while we sat around
and watched!</i>

47:26.177 --> 47:28.211
Would you shut up,
think for a second?

47:28.213 --> 47:29.512
What'd you think
would've happened

47:29.514 --> 47:30.980
if we tried to interfere?

47:30.982 --> 47:32.615
You think
they would've let us live?

47:32.617 --> 47:34.851
<i>So you're saying
there's nothing we can do.</i>

47:34.853 --> 47:36.085
<i>We're gonna watch them kill.</i>

47:36.087 --> 47:38.554
We are doing something.

47:38.556 --> 47:41.090
We're letting people know
what's going on here.

47:41.092 --> 47:43.192
<i>So why aren't we
getting out of here?</i>

47:43.194 --> 47:46.362
<i>- What about our safety?
- Don't you get it?</i>

47:46.364 --> 47:49.999
We're gonna let people know
what these things really are.

47:50.001 --> 47:51.567
I mean, yeah, look.

47:51.569 --> 47:54.337
Fine, okay, we couldn't save one

47:54.339 --> 47:56.372
we're gonna save more
in the long run.

47:56.374 --> 47:58.407
What good's it gonna do
if you're dead

47:58.409 --> 48:00.209
you can't tell anyone?

48:00.211 --> 48:01.510
<i>Yeah, well...</i>

48:03.480 --> 48:07.416
<i>Do you believe what
they were saying about her?</i>

48:07.418 --> 48:10.353
I don't, I don't know.

48:10.355 --> 48:11.654
But it's dark.

48:15.225 --> 48:17.460
The only thing
that matters now is, is

48:17.462 --> 48:20.463
I've to make sure
the three of us get home safely.

48:20.465 --> 48:22.531
<i>- Okay?
- Is she doing any better?</i>

48:22.533 --> 48:26.235
How the fuck should I know? I
mean, does she look any better?

48:33.477 --> 48:34.677
<i>[Benny]
What?</i>

48:34.679 --> 48:36.979
<i>Are those Samuel's daughters?</i>

48:36.981 --> 48:38.981
<i>Hey, Mike. Check this out.</i>

48:38.983 --> 48:40.616
<i>- Wait, what? What is it?
- Shh, shh...</i>

48:40.618 --> 48:42.385
<i>[Benny]
Down there at the pool.</i>

48:46.423 --> 48:48.291
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

48:48.293 --> 48:50.693
<i>Aren't they supposed
to be sisters?</i>

48:50.695 --> 48:52.194
<i>[Mike]
That's what I thought.</i>

48:55.699 --> 48:58.601
This whole friggin' family
is weird.

49:02.706 --> 49:04.340
<i>[knocking on door]</i>

49:12.683 --> 49:15.584
- Hey, guys. Bad time?
- No.

49:17.587 --> 49:20.656
So did the little ritual
freak you guys out or what?

49:20.658 --> 49:23.326
No, not really.

49:23.328 --> 49:26.729
<i>- How about you, Benny?
- No. No bother at all.</i>

49:26.731 --> 49:28.664
Cool, man. Cool.

49:28.666 --> 49:31.734
So everybody's downstairs,
started figuring

49:31.736 --> 49:34.236
maybe you guys wanna come
with Selvin and I

49:34.238 --> 49:35.671
to document the night and stuff.

49:35.673 --> 49:38.140
- You game?
- Sure. Why not?

49:38.142 --> 49:41.444
- What do you think, Benny?
- Sure.

49:41.446 --> 49:44.714
Awesome! Oh, man,
this is gonna be so much fun.

49:44.716 --> 49:46.716
But we can't tell Andrew.

49:46.718 --> 49:48.751
Okay? We've to keep it
behind his backs.

49:48.753 --> 49:50.753
They're busy downstairs
with Samuel whatever

49:50.755 --> 49:53.155
let's sneak out
the back quietly.

49:53.157 --> 49:55.191
Man, this is gonna be
so much fun.

49:55.193 --> 49:57.593
You're gonna get so much
kick-ass footage. Trust me.

49:57.595 --> 50:01.263
Trust me. Just...
You can trust me.

50:01.265 --> 50:03.032
Alright, let's rock and roll.

50:03.034 --> 50:05.334
Oh!

50:05.336 --> 50:08.270
- How's your girl doing?
- Ah, she's better, I think.

50:11.241 --> 50:12.708
Right on.

50:12.710 --> 50:14.543
Selvin, get your ass in here.

50:18.482 --> 50:20.716
Ah, we're ready to go, so...

50:20.718 --> 50:22.485
- Let's go.
- Ho!

50:22.487 --> 50:24.353
- We're not going that way.
- We're not?

50:24.355 --> 50:27.156
- No.
- Wait. What's going on?

50:27.158 --> 50:29.291
Grab Benny. I got Mike.

50:29.293 --> 50:32.595
Ah!

50:32.597 --> 50:34.330
Oh, no!

50:36.633 --> 50:38.768
I was just fucking with you.

50:38.770 --> 50:41.237
You thought we could fly?

50:41.239 --> 50:43.639
You've seen too many movies,
Mikey.

50:43.641 --> 50:46.108
Come on, we're gonna take
the back staircase.

50:52.416 --> 50:55.284
[laughing]

50:55.286 --> 50:57.386
Oh! You, did you...

50:57.388 --> 50:59.722
Did you wet?
You should've seen your face.

50:59.724 --> 51:01.590
Alright, listen, listen.
The lights burn out.

51:01.592 --> 51:03.592
So make sure
you watch your step.

51:12.636 --> 51:14.837
Shh!

51:14.839 --> 51:17.673
- Quiet.
- Hey, Benny, watch your step.

51:17.675 --> 51:19.842
<i>[Benny]
Oh! Oh, geez...</i>

51:22.479 --> 51:24.146
Quick. Quick.

51:31.121 --> 51:32.521
Come on. Come on.

51:40.297 --> 51:41.564
Let's go!

51:45.435 --> 51:47.636
So that girl
that was sacrificed today

51:47.638 --> 51:50.239
was she actually sick?

51:50.241 --> 51:53.142
Fuck, no. No, no, we found her
on the street tonight.

51:53.144 --> 51:55.444
<i>- True story.
- I knew it.</i>

51:55.446 --> 51:59.482
- So why weren't you there?
- Oh!

51:59.484 --> 52:02.651
Listen, those guys
and the whole domesticated...

52:02.653 --> 52:05.354
Andrew trying to be domestic,
fuck that. Losing his edge.

52:05.356 --> 52:08.124
So you're saying that you
wanna continue killing, then?

52:08.126 --> 52:11.393
Listen, what I'm saying is,
no offence

52:11.395 --> 52:13.863
but I want humans to fear us

52:13.865 --> 52:17.366
because if they fear us,
then they respect us.

52:18.435 --> 52:19.668
Come on!

52:24.174 --> 52:26.208
This is so much fun.

52:28.678 --> 52:31.147
Hey, hey, come on,
get down, get down.

52:31.149 --> 52:32.848
- See the house with the light?
- Yeah.

52:32.850 --> 52:35.351
- That's where we're going.
- Okay. Why?

52:35.353 --> 52:37.820
Ah, well, it's a little bit
out of the way

52:37.822 --> 52:39.889
and a bunch of stoners
live there.

52:39.891 --> 52:42.424
Oh, Selvin likes
one of the guys, too. So...

52:42.426 --> 52:44.393
But why are we here?

52:44.395 --> 52:46.262
Well, you wanna see how we live?

52:46.264 --> 52:48.898
That's what I'm trying to show
you. Keep the camera rolling.

52:48.900 --> 52:51.167
Footage's gonna be amazing.
Come on. Come on.

52:55.605 --> 52:57.473
Sneak around the back. Come on.

53:02.646 --> 53:06.348
Okay, it's gonna be good. Shh!

53:06.350 --> 53:07.550
Go, go, go...

53:11.254 --> 53:13.656
Make sure to keep the camera
on me, okay?

53:13.658 --> 53:15.257
Follow closely.

53:19.596 --> 53:21.397
Uh, but...

53:21.399 --> 53:24.600
Okay. Make sure to keep
the camera on both of us.

53:24.602 --> 53:26.669
<i>[Benny]
Uh, got it.</i>

53:26.671 --> 53:28.204
<i>- Alright.
- Okay.</i>

53:28.206 --> 53:29.505
It's showtime.

53:46.223 --> 53:47.256
Got it.

53:57.434 --> 53:58.634
<i>[male #2]
Yo!</i>

54:00.303 --> 54:02.238
Let's grab some beers.

54:07.711 --> 54:10.012
<i>- What are we doing?
- Shit, man!</i>

54:10.014 --> 54:11.547
[groaning]

54:13.717 --> 54:16.352
<i>- Benny! Benny!
- What?</i>

54:16.354 --> 54:18.654
<i>- What?
- Oh, look.</i>

54:18.656 --> 54:21.457
Okay. Now the rest
of the pinheads.

54:21.459 --> 54:23.559
Stay behind us. Come on.

54:33.837 --> 54:36.839
[laughing]

54:36.841 --> 54:39.475
Excuse me, germs,
if I may please

54:39.477 --> 54:41.377
have your undivided attention.

54:41.379 --> 54:42.845
Oh!

54:42.847 --> 54:44.713
You got ten seconds to get out

54:44.715 --> 54:46.749
before I knock
the fuck out of you.

54:46.751 --> 54:48.350
Excuse me, you're interrupting!

54:48.352 --> 54:52.454
Hey, Glen, go get
my fucking gun off the dresser.

54:52.456 --> 54:55.691
Fucking now! Go!

54:55.693 --> 54:58.327
Ooh, tough guy.
It's gonna be good.

54:58.329 --> 55:00.896
Oh! He's got a knife.
You wanna stab...

55:00.898 --> 55:04.066
You wanna stab me?
Okay, go ahead. Come on. Do it.

55:04.068 --> 55:05.901
- Oh!
- Come on.

55:05.903 --> 55:08.837
Did you just stab me?

55:08.839 --> 55:11.573
You're gettin' this?
Is that, is that your best shot?

55:11.575 --> 55:14.777
Come on, motherfucker! Come on!

55:14.779 --> 55:17.946
I'm choking.
You wanna see something scary?

55:22.919 --> 55:26.722
<i>- Oh! Oh!
- That had to hurt.</i>

55:27.424 --> 55:29.558
Hey!

55:29.560 --> 55:33.095
Get the fuck away from him.

55:33.097 --> 55:35.597
I'm, I'm gonna fucking kill you.

55:35.599 --> 55:37.066
That's not gonna happen.

55:37.068 --> 55:38.801
[gunshot]

55:38.803 --> 55:40.035
Did you just shoot me?

55:40.037 --> 55:42.371
[groaning]

55:42.373 --> 55:43.739
Get him! Get him!

55:43.741 --> 55:45.341
One!

55:46.710 --> 55:48.677
<i>Two!</i>

55:48.679 --> 55:50.346
[grunting]

55:52.949 --> 55:54.983
I never get to make a wish!

55:54.985 --> 55:57.453
Oh, Benny, you wanna see
what it looks like?

55:57.455 --> 56:00.055
Blake, kill him, just do it
so he doesn't suffer.

56:00.057 --> 56:03.892
I mean, his body is in shock.
He doesn't feel anything.

56:03.894 --> 56:05.961
See? Oh, hey, you know what?

56:05.963 --> 56:07.796
You wanna interview me
during the process?

56:07.798 --> 56:09.465
Come here, come here, Benny.

56:09.467 --> 56:11.400
Yes. Okay, wait.
Can you see everything?

56:11.402 --> 56:12.935
<i>- Uh-huh.
- Okay, good.</i>

56:12.937 --> 56:14.770
Ask me some questions.

56:14.772 --> 56:17.005
Uh...

56:17.007 --> 56:20.776
What-what goes through your mind
when you're killing people?

56:20.778 --> 56:22.845
Pure adrenalin rush, man.

56:22.847 --> 56:24.913
Hey, Selvin,
what are you feeling?

56:28.051 --> 56:29.918
It feels nice.

56:29.920 --> 56:31.854
"It feels nice." There you go.

56:31.856 --> 56:34.990
Uh, anything-anything else?

56:34.992 --> 56:36.425
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

56:36.427 --> 56:39.962
One more question, okay?
Go ahead.

56:39.964 --> 56:43.732
Why do you kill since blood
is readily available to you?

56:43.734 --> 56:46.068
Ooh, that's a good question.

56:46.070 --> 56:49.605
Um, the hunt.
Yes, we really enjoy the hunt.

56:49.607 --> 56:51.440
That's the part that's human,
you know?

56:51.442 --> 56:53.776
We don't want our food
just given to us

56:53.778 --> 56:56.145
like we're a bunch
of caged animals, you know?

57:10.894 --> 57:14.096
- Alright, we're here. Come on.
- Ah...

57:14.098 --> 57:17.099
Oh! Tonight was fun, right?
It's good.

57:17.101 --> 57:21.637
Hey, but you know, you gotta
keep this between us. Okay?

57:21.639 --> 57:24.840
Everyone is gonna find out
when we release the footage.

57:27.844 --> 57:28.877
Oh.

57:30.447 --> 57:33.582
Good. I hope it shocks
the shit out of 'em.

57:33.584 --> 57:37.519
I mean, fuck Andrew and his
politically correct bullshit.

57:37.521 --> 57:40.489
I had a lot of fun.
Come on, let's go.

57:42.826 --> 57:44.860
Selvin, come on.

57:54.838 --> 57:56.705
<i>[Benny]
So we got the footage.</i>

57:56.707 --> 57:58.574
<i>Why the hell
aren't we leaving yet?</i>

57:58.576 --> 58:00.676
<i>How much more
do we have to get...</i>

58:00.678 --> 58:02.978
What's going on over there?
Zoom in.

58:02.980 --> 58:04.813
<i>Fine.</i>

58:04.815 --> 58:07.883
<i>[Mike]
Samuel and Elleanor.</i>

58:07.885 --> 58:11.086
<i>[Benny] Good talking, Mike. Glad
our lives means so much to you.</i>

58:11.088 --> 58:14.089
<i>[Mike]
Wait. Where is Andrew?</i>

58:14.091 --> 58:16.959
<i>[Benny]
And you're totally ignoring me.</i>

58:18.495 --> 58:19.962
Well, turn on the audio.

58:23.066 --> 58:26.568
I'll never forget you and you'll
be a part of me forever

58:26.570 --> 58:29.505
but it's best
if I stay with Andrew.

58:29.507 --> 58:31.874
I worry about you, so...

58:31.876 --> 58:33.976
And I don't believe
that Andrew could provide

58:33.978 --> 58:36.011
the protection that you need.

58:36.013 --> 58:38.514
And I don't trust
this film crew.

58:38.516 --> 58:40.816
You worry too much, Samuel.

58:40.818 --> 58:42.751
I've it under control
and you forget

58:42.753 --> 58:45.020
how long I've been
looking after myself.

58:47.123 --> 58:49.591
I can't let any harm
come your way.

58:52.295 --> 58:55.264
I will always be yours.

58:55.266 --> 58:57.633
You were always
such a romantic.

59:00.136 --> 59:02.137
Goodnight, dear Samuel.

59:04.874 --> 59:06.108
Goodnight, my dear.

59:14.717 --> 59:18.020
<i>[Benny] Seems like some sort
of a love triangle or something.</i>

59:18.022 --> 59:19.821
Yeah, I guess.

59:19.823 --> 59:22.324
Um, let's see what's going on
on the other cameras.

59:27.163 --> 59:28.997
Blake, what the hell
were you thinking?

59:28.999 --> 59:31.867
I don't see
what the big deal is.

59:31.869 --> 59:34.002
I mean, everybody needs to know
we're vampires.

59:34.004 --> 59:35.971
No, they don't know!

59:35.973 --> 59:38.907
They do not know!

59:38.909 --> 59:41.243
And you have to sabotage
our plan to make...

59:41.245 --> 59:44.146
What? What? What?
That we're all domesticated?

59:44.148 --> 59:46.582
This was to take us home
for the holidays?

59:46.584 --> 59:49.051
Come on.
They're just food to us, man.

59:49.053 --> 59:52.888
I mean, I'm sick of this whole
masquerade we're ordinary folks.

59:52.890 --> 59:54.723
It's not cutting it for me,
Andrew.

59:54.725 --> 59:56.758
How are we supposed
to easily overtake them

59:56.760 --> 59:59.227
if they know we're their
enemies? You need to think.

59:59.229 --> 01:00:02.030
You have just taken away
our advantage!

01:00:02.032 --> 01:00:06.001
Okay. Okay.
So then what do you wanna do?

01:00:06.003 --> 01:00:08.270
You know exactly
what you need to do now.

01:00:10.073 --> 01:00:11.306
<i>[Benny]
Oh, shit.</i>

01:00:12.175 --> 01:00:14.276
<i>What do we do?</i>

01:00:14.278 --> 01:00:15.811
We're getting out of here.

01:00:15.813 --> 01:00:17.279
<i>- Now.
- It's about fucking time.</i>

01:00:17.281 --> 01:00:19.114
<i>I know
you like to get footage...</i>

01:00:19.116 --> 01:00:20.315
<i>[knocking on door]</i>

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:26.722
Hi. Sorry to bother you.

01:00:26.724 --> 01:00:29.257
Um, we've prepared
a late dinner for you.

01:00:29.259 --> 01:00:32.227
Oh, well,
we're not hungry, so thank...

01:00:32.229 --> 01:00:34.863
Andrew would actually
like to have a word with you.

01:00:34.865 --> 01:00:37.332
And he's requested that
you don't bring any cameras.

01:00:39.836 --> 01:00:42.337
Okay. Uh, we'll be right down.

01:00:42.339 --> 01:00:44.806
Good.
We'll be expecting you shortly.

01:00:46.976 --> 01:00:48.844
<i>[Benny]
We can't go down there, Mike.</i>

01:00:48.846 --> 01:00:50.278
If we don't go down there

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:52.114
they're gonna know
we're on to them.

01:00:52.116 --> 01:00:53.649
<i>If we do, we're dead.</i>

01:00:53.651 --> 01:00:56.318
Just film this
on your microcam, alright?

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:57.986
Put this camera down.

01:00:59.222 --> 01:01:02.791
Okay. Try to be
as relaxed as possible.

01:01:02.793 --> 01:01:04.960
Okay, we can't act scared

01:01:04.962 --> 01:01:07.262
or act like
we know something's up.

01:01:16.439 --> 01:01:19.107
Ah. There they are.

01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:23.378
- Come in. Sit.
- Thank you.

01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:24.813
Benny, you must feel naked

01:01:24.815 --> 01:01:26.448
without a camera
around your neck.

01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:28.383
<i>[Benny] It does feel a little strange.</i>

01:01:28.385 --> 01:01:30.118
<i>Yeah, almost like I'm naked.</i>

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:32.120
Wow, all this food.

01:01:33.022 --> 01:01:34.723
What's the occasion?

01:01:34.725 --> 01:01:36.158
Well, you, of course.

01:01:37.794 --> 01:01:38.994
Please dig in.

01:01:40.897 --> 01:01:42.898
So...

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:44.866
you've been with us a while.

01:01:44.868 --> 01:01:48.103
- Got enough footage?
- Uh...

01:01:48.105 --> 01:01:50.472
Yeah, I think
we got a decent amount.

01:01:50.474 --> 01:01:53.942
Um, you know,
as filmmakers, we...

01:01:53.944 --> 01:01:56.445
we always try to get
as much footage as possible

01:01:56.447 --> 01:01:59.114
you know, just so
we have more to cut with.

01:01:59.116 --> 01:02:00.148
Mm.

01:02:02.285 --> 01:02:05.487
So did that, uh

01:02:05.489 --> 01:02:07.456
ceremonial ritual of ours, uh

01:02:07.458 --> 01:02:09.491
did you find that disturbing?

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:12.227
I've seen worse.

01:02:12.229 --> 01:02:14.930
I visited the tribes in Africa

01:02:14.932 --> 01:02:17.299
that practiced cannibalism.

01:02:17.301 --> 01:02:19.935
So I've gotten very used
to seeing rituals

01:02:19.937 --> 01:02:21.870
of different cultures.

01:02:21.872 --> 01:02:23.438
I'm sure you have.

01:02:24.407 --> 01:02:26.007
So what do you think?

01:02:26.909 --> 01:02:29.177
I'm sorry? Uh, about what?

01:02:29.179 --> 01:02:30.846
What do you think of us?

01:02:32.248 --> 01:02:34.349
Um, I think you're...

01:02:34.351 --> 01:02:36.251
very similar to us.

01:02:37.353 --> 01:02:39.755
Really? That's an improvement.

01:02:39.757 --> 01:02:41.022
In what way?

01:02:42.058 --> 01:02:43.792
Well, th-the two of you.

01:02:43.794 --> 01:02:47.429
For instance,
your relationship seems...

01:02:48.464 --> 01:02:50.232
just like any other couple.

01:02:50.867 --> 01:02:53.235
I see.

01:02:53.237 --> 01:02:56.404
And how do you think you'll
portray us in the documentary?

01:02:56.406 --> 01:02:59.808
Uh, well, I have to take a look
at the footage first

01:02:59.810 --> 01:03:03.111
and cut it together, but I think
you'll find it to your liking.

01:03:03.113 --> 01:03:04.513
And does that footage include

01:03:04.515 --> 01:03:08.016
uh, what you shot
with Selvin and Blake?

01:03:09.185 --> 01:03:11.853
I- I, we, when we got invited

01:03:11.855 --> 01:03:14.122
to, uh, join them
earlier this evening

01:03:14.124 --> 01:03:16.958
we had no idea
what they had in store for us.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:18.994
I've already spoken to Blake.

01:03:18.996 --> 01:03:21.863
Blake knows that he will be
severely punished.

01:03:21.865 --> 01:03:25.033
I mean, how would you think
that footage will make us look?

01:03:25.035 --> 01:03:27.803
Well, if it's that important
to you, um

01:03:27.805 --> 01:03:29.838
we could just give you
the storage cartridge

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:31.006
that we used tonight.

01:03:31.008 --> 01:03:32.207
Mm-hmm.

01:03:33.843 --> 01:03:37.078
I mean, uh,
you know, I could just

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:40.448
go and find out which ones
we used and give them to you.

01:03:42.985 --> 01:03:46.421
Benny, uh, can you help me find
which cards were used tonight?

01:03:46.423 --> 01:03:48.390
<i>- Yeah.
- We-we'll be right back.</i>

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:52.828
We'll be right here.

01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:58.533
<i>[Benny]
Mike, what are you doing?</i>

01:03:58.535 --> 01:04:01.036
<i>We're not gonna give them
those cards, are we?</i>

01:04:02.972 --> 01:04:04.439
Of course not.

01:04:04.441 --> 01:04:06.875
They would have killed us
right then and there.

01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:14.082
Holy water.
We're getting out of here now.

01:04:14.084 --> 01:04:16.117
<i>[Benny] They said holy
water doesn't affect them.</i>

01:04:16.119 --> 01:04:18.353
Yeah, well,
I don't believe a word they say.

01:04:18.355 --> 01:04:20.422
<i>Dude, bullets won't work.</i>

01:04:20.424 --> 01:04:22.257
They do
when they're dipped in silver.

01:04:22.259 --> 01:04:23.892
<i>Since when do you have time?</i>

01:04:23.894 --> 01:04:25.327
I told you, I come prepared.

01:04:25.329 --> 01:04:27.262
Here, put this on.

01:04:27.264 --> 01:04:28.563
<i>Any stakes?</i>

01:04:28.565 --> 01:04:31.633
No, but I do have these.

01:04:31.635 --> 01:04:33.101
<i>Where did you find them?</i>

01:04:33.103 --> 01:04:34.936
You can get anything
on the Internet.

01:04:34.938 --> 01:04:37.939
Hey, uh, check the cameras
and tell me where they're at.

01:04:39.642 --> 01:04:41.142
<i>Mike, they look anxious.</i>

01:04:41.144 --> 01:04:42.944
<i>They're gonna catch on.</i>

01:04:42.946 --> 01:04:45.347
Oh, shit, we gotta go now.

01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:48.183
Carrie, come on,
you gotta wake up.

01:04:48.185 --> 01:04:50.952
- No, I'm too tired.
- Oh, come on.

01:04:50.954 --> 01:04:53.021
Hey, get the CF cards,
the hard drive

01:04:53.023 --> 01:04:55.023
but leave everything else.

01:04:55.025 --> 01:04:57.592
<i>- I'm grabbing the Hi8, too.
- Well, what-what for?</i>

01:04:57.594 --> 01:05:00.428
<i>[Benny] It's the one with
night vision. We might need it.</i>

01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:02.163
<i>[Mike]
Fine, whatever.</i>

01:05:02.165 --> 01:05:06.001
<i>Carrie, Carrie,
you gotta get up.</i>

01:05:06.003 --> 01:05:09.004
<i>- Hey, I-I got it all.
- Just put it in my backpack.</i>

01:05:09.006 --> 01:05:12.974
<i>- Alright.
- Carrie, wake up. Carrie.</i>

01:05:12.976 --> 01:05:16.945
<i>I'm gonna check
where they're at.</i>

01:05:16.947 --> 01:05:19.247
<i>Mike, they're getting up.
We gotta go now.</i>

01:05:19.249 --> 01:05:20.982
- Carrie, wake up!
- Oh.

01:05:20.984 --> 01:05:22.417
- We gotta go right now.
- Okay.

01:05:22.419 --> 01:05:24.252
Come on, get up, get up.

01:05:26.188 --> 01:05:29.157
<i>[Benny] Holy shit,
dude. Look at her back!</i>

01:05:29.159 --> 01:05:32.427
Uh, s-stay still, okay?
Uh, lemme see.

01:05:32.429 --> 01:05:33.695
What's that?

01:05:33.697 --> 01:05:36.698
- Oh, fuck!
- What? Is it bad?

01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:40.435
<i>[Benny]
Um, no, it's not that bad.</i>

01:05:40.437 --> 01:05:44.239
<i>Listen, uh, can-can you walk?</i>

01:05:44.241 --> 01:05:46.341
- Yeah, 'cause we gotta go.
- Okay.

01:05:46.343 --> 01:05:48.176
Okay, come on.

01:05:48.178 --> 01:05:49.544
<i>Mike, they're gone.</i>

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:53.515
- Here, put this on.
- Okay.

01:05:56.052 --> 01:05:58.320
Come on, come on, come on.

01:05:58.322 --> 01:05:59.654
Here, take this.

01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:03.191
<i>[Benny]
They're right at the door.</i>

01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:10.565
Where'd they go?

01:06:10.567 --> 01:06:13.234
<i>[Benny] I don't, I don't
know, the-they're gone.</i>

01:06:21.077 --> 01:06:22.544
<i>- Leaving us so soon?
- Fuck you.</i>

01:06:22.546 --> 01:06:24.579
We don't plan on being
your next meal.

01:06:24.581 --> 01:06:26.414
Well, now the cat's out of bag

01:06:26.416 --> 01:06:28.683
I might as well show you
our true nature

01:06:28.685 --> 01:06:31.086
so that you wouldn't be
too disappointed.

01:06:31.088 --> 01:06:32.554
Hey, get the fuck back!

01:06:33.723 --> 01:06:35.757
We were never gonna let you go.

01:06:37.059 --> 01:06:38.126
Never.

01:06:42.098 --> 01:06:44.165
Come on, come on, let's go.

01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:45.433
Let's go, let's go!

01:06:48.304 --> 01:06:51.106
Hey! Whoa, guys...

01:06:52.408 --> 01:06:54.109
You think
you're going somewhere, huh?

01:06:54.111 --> 01:06:55.744
- Huh?
- You have to let us go.

01:06:55.746 --> 01:06:57.779
How's anyone gonna see
the footage we shot?

01:06:57.781 --> 01:07:00.615
I don't need you for that.
I can deliver it myself.

01:07:00.617 --> 01:07:05.020
Whoa! Look at you, bossman.
You wanna play, huh? Come on!

01:07:05.022 --> 01:07:07.222
<i>- Mike!
- Whoa! Hoo! Hoo!</i>

01:07:07.224 --> 01:07:09.324
Another knife. Okay, dear.

01:07:09.326 --> 01:07:11.159
Think something's gonna happen?
Nothing's gonna happen.

01:07:11.161 --> 01:07:13.061
Go ahead. Stick it in me, okay?

01:07:13.063 --> 01:07:15.697
Don't look at him, look at me!
Stick it in me.

01:07:15.699 --> 01:07:17.532
Nothing's gonna happen.
Here's my heart.

01:07:17.534 --> 01:07:20.335
There you go, right there.
Okay, one, two...

01:07:20.337 --> 01:07:22.270

<i>- We gotta go.
- It's locked.</i>

01:07:40.323 --> 01:07:42.557
<i>[Elleanor] You won't get
out of the front door.</i>

01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:45.727
It's sealed. You'll pay
for what you did to Blake.

01:07:47.129 --> 01:07:49.164
<i>- Let's go out the back!
- Let's go.</i>

01:07:49.166 --> 01:07:50.198
This way!

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:53.835
Stay back!

01:07:56.338 --> 01:07:57.505

01:08:00.609 --> 01:08:02.644
Keep moving. This way, this way.

01:08:02.646 --> 01:08:04.646
Nowhere else to go.

01:08:04.648 --> 01:08:07.549
Down here! Go, go, go!

<i>- Watch your step.
- Oh.</i>

01:08:17.661 --> 01:08:20.361
- You know, I got it.
- Smells so bad in here.

01:08:25.801 --> 01:08:28.203
<i>- Get that light out of my eyes.
- Sorry.</i>

01:08:31.173 --> 01:08:33.774
<i>- Whoa, what's this?
- Benny, quit...</i>

01:08:33.777 --> 01:08:36.243
<i>- Guys, look at this.
- Quit fucking around, alright?</i>

01:08:36.246 --> 01:08:38.846
<i>- They could be down any second.
- Looks just like Elle.</i>

01:08:38.849 --> 01:08:40.381
<i>[Carrie]
Probably some old painting.</i>

01:08:40.383 --> 01:08:41.616
<i>[Benny]
Guys, look at it.</i>

01:08:41.618 --> 01:08:43.551
<i>I- I-I-I-I think she's...</i>

01:08:43.553 --> 01:08:44.752
We gotta move.

01:08:51.694 --> 01:08:54.529
<i>[Benny] Yeah, how do we know
there's a way out from...</i>

01:08:54.531 --> 01:08:57.165
Well, it's better than
going back up there, isn't it?

01:08:57.167 --> 01:08:58.800
[Carrie]
Why aren't they following us?

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:00.568
<i>[Benny]
Shit, that's a good question.</i>

01:09:00.569 --> 01:09:03.470
Probably 'cause they think
we're gonna die down here.

01:09:03.473 --> 01:09:05.807
<i>- Reassuring as always, asshole.
- Oh!</i>

01:09:05.809 --> 01:09:08.143
You know,
you didn't have to come along.

01:09:08.145 --> 01:09:10.178
- Please don't remind me.
- Then why did you?

01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:12.747
- You really wanna do this now?
- Yeah, I do.

01:09:12.749 --> 01:09:16.484
Because I wanted to see
if you were gonna change.

01:09:16.486 --> 01:09:18.453
Oh, what?
You want me all nice?

01:09:18.455 --> 01:09:20.522
No, I want you
to fucking grow up.

01:09:20.524 --> 01:09:22.256
Stop taking credit
for everything good

01:09:22.259 --> 01:09:25.326
and laying the blame for
everything bad on everyone else!

01:09:27.462 --> 01:09:28.863
<i>[Benny]
Oh, Carrie, you alright?</i>

01:09:28.865 --> 01:09:30.298
Hey, I'm sorry.

01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:32.399
I just need to rest
for a second.

01:09:35.304 --> 01:09:36.804
Oh, fuck! Jesus!

01:09:36.805 --> 01:09:39.439
<i>- Holy shit!
- Did you guys see that?</i>

01:09:39.442 --> 01:09:40.841
No, we're fucking blind, Benny.

01:09:40.844 --> 01:09:42.877
Why do you give me a hard time?

01:09:42.879 --> 01:09:46.747
<i>- I don't give you a hard time.
- Yes, you have, from day one.</i>

01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:50.218
<i>I get you don't like me,
you don't want me on your team.</i>

01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:51.653
Haven't I earned the right to...

01:09:51.654 --> 01:09:52.921
I've been to the most

01:09:52.923 --> 01:09:54.722
dangerous places
in the world, right?

01:09:54.724 --> 01:09:57.759
Where the fuck have you been?
You haven't earned shit.

01:09:57.761 --> 01:09:59.494
<i>[Benny] Carrie's right.
You're an asshole.</i>

01:09:59.496 --> 01:10:02.397
Oh, my God. Guys, now's
not the fucking time, okay?

01:10:05.668 --> 01:10:07.902
<i>[Benny] This basement
seems to go on and on.</i>

01:10:07.904 --> 01:10:10.471
And there's bodies everywhere.

01:10:12.741 --> 01:10:14.542
Here, let's move this dresser.

- Damn it.
- Thanks for the fucking help.

01:10:21.351 --> 01:10:23.518
<i>[Benny] I
- I don't like the looks of this.</i>

01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:26.688
Yeah, but it could be a way out.

01:10:26.690 --> 01:10:28.590
- Carrie, let me go first.
- No.

It smells even worse in here.

Oh, God, I can't even take it.

01:10:51.982 --> 01:10:53.448

01:14:37.474 --> 01:14:39.907
After we've shown you
all our dirty, little secrets.

01:14:39.909 --> 01:14:41.943
Yeah, we've seen all the people
you've killed.

01:14:41.945 --> 01:14:43.578
You're hiding behind a facade.

01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:46.647
Facade? Yours is the facade.

01:14:46.649 --> 01:14:48.082
You've been pretending
the entire time

01:14:48.084 --> 01:14:49.750
you've been with us.

01:14:49.752 --> 01:14:51.519
Stay the fuck back.

01:14:51.521 --> 01:14:53.621
Guns! Guns, honey.

01:14:53.623 --> 01:14:55.056
Guns have been used against us

01:14:55.058 --> 01:14:57.024
for hundreds of years
to no avail.

01:14:57.026 --> 01:14:58.793
<i>(man speaking
foreign language)</i>

01:14:58.795 --> 01:15:00.628
Yeah, but this is loaded
with silver.

01:15:00.630 --> 01:15:02.063
<i>- Really?
- Fuckin' shoot him!</i>

01:15:03.999 --> 01:15:06.767
[gunshots]

01:15:06.769 --> 01:15:09.770
<i>[Benny groaning]</i>

01:15:13.242 --> 01:15:15.743
[groaning]

01:15:17.646 --> 01:15:20.615
Now! Where is your friend,
Carrie?

01:15:20.617 --> 01:15:23.251
- Did she get lost down below?
- Is she in the tunnels?

01:15:23.253 --> 01:15:26.087
Because if she is,
you'll never see her again!

01:15:26.089 --> 01:15:28.689
Revive him. Revive him.

01:15:28.691 --> 01:15:32.260
If he wants to film something,
he can film his friend's demise.

01:15:32.262 --> 01:15:33.728
Have some water, Benny.

01:15:33.730 --> 01:15:35.196
<i>[Benny groans]</i>

01:15:36.164 --> 01:15:37.565
[screaming]

01:15:37.567 --> 01:15:39.600
<i>[Benny]
It's holy water, bitch!</i>

01:15:42.971 --> 01:15:45.973
[grunting]

01:15:47.042 --> 01:15:49.110
[screams]

01:15:56.184 --> 01:15:57.919
Yes, I'll explain.

01:15:57.921 --> 01:16:00.688
We're in
a bit of a standoff here.

01:16:00.690 --> 01:16:03.891
Now, you let her go
and I will let you both live.

01:16:03.893 --> 01:16:05.927
Don't do it, Benny,
they'll kill us both!

01:16:05.929 --> 01:16:07.995
Always the wrong assumptions.

01:16:07.997 --> 01:16:10.331
You bloodsacks
are so predictable.

01:16:10.333 --> 01:16:12.567
<i>[Benny] I know more than you think, man.</i>

01:16:12.569 --> 01:16:13.935
By all means, enlighten us.

01:16:13.937 --> 01:16:15.970
<i>I know that Elleanor's
one of the elders.</i>

01:16:15.972 --> 01:16:17.338
[screams]

01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:19.707
[Andrew]
Ah! Oh, no.

01:16:21.843 --> 01:16:22.910
Get off of me!

01:16:22.912 --> 01:16:24.912
[groaning]

01:16:24.914 --> 01:16:27.081
<i>[Elleanor screams]</i>

01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:30.151
Go, go, go! Benny! Let's go!

01:16:33.755 --> 01:16:35.289
<i>[panting]</i>

01:16:37.659 --> 01:16:40.094
<i>- Come on, come on!
- I'm coming.</i>

01:16:40.096 --> 01:16:41.829
How did you know?

01:16:41.831 --> 01:16:45.299
<i>- I saw the painting.
- That's why Andrew let go of me.</i>

01:16:45.301 --> 01:16:48.836
<i>[Benny] Samuel said they'd all be
in pain if an elder were killed.</i>

01:16:48.838 --> 01:16:51.839
<i>[panting]</i>

01:16:51.841 --> 01:16:55.142
<i>[Benny]
Holy shit! We made it!</i>

01:16:55.144 --> 01:16:56.978
<i>Tell me you have
your fucking keys!</i>

01:16:56.980 --> 01:16:58.879
Yeah, I got 'em right here.

01:16:58.881 --> 01:17:02.149
- So you got all that on camera?
- Yeah, it's still rolling, man.

01:17:02.151 --> 01:17:03.985
<i>- We got everything.
- You know something, Benny?</i>

01:17:03.987 --> 01:17:05.686
<i>What's that?</i>

01:17:05.688 --> 01:17:07.755
You're welcome on my crew
anytime.

01:17:08.724 --> 01:17:11.192
God. You hear that?

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:14.328
I'm welcome anytime.

01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:16.097
Good evening. I'm Paul Linn.

01:17:16.099 --> 01:17:18.032
Tonight we have
sectional leader, Samuel

01:17:18.034 --> 01:17:19.800
who joins us live via satellite

01:17:19.802 --> 01:17:21.836
to discuss
the recent vampire debates.

01:17:21.838 --> 01:17:24.238
Samuel, thanks for joining us.

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:27.241
My pleasure, Paul.
Great to be here.

01:17:27.243 --> 01:17:30.311
What is it you wanna tell us
about the rumors of violence

01:17:30.313 --> 01:17:32.813
done by so-called vampires?

01:17:32.815 --> 01:17:34.782
This is pure ignorance.

01:17:34.784 --> 01:17:36.183
None of our kind

01:17:36.185 --> 01:17:38.986
want to use violence
against humans as an option.

01:17:38.988 --> 01:17:41.389
None of us. We find it
ridiculous and insulting

01:17:41.391 --> 01:17:42.857
What about the spreading rumors

01:17:42.859 --> 01:17:44.859
of a missing news crew
from KMMBR

01:17:44.861 --> 01:17:47.895
that was sent in to interview
a vampire family

01:17:47.897 --> 01:17:50.097
that you arranged?

01:17:50.099 --> 01:17:53.200
Paul,
that is blatantly ridiculous.

01:17:53.202 --> 01:17:55.870
If that happened,
where is the proof?

01:17:55.872 --> 01:17:57.304
There isn't any proof.

01:17:57.306 --> 01:18:00.741
- I never, ever...
- But, Samuel...

01:18:00.743 --> 01:18:02.376
And the sheer audacity

01:18:02.378 --> 01:18:04.779
that-that-that
we're somehow responsible

01:18:04.781 --> 01:18:07.181
for the disappearance
of a news crew, it's...

01:18:07.183 --> 01:18:09.216
I- I'll tell you what?
I find this...

01:18:09.218 --> 01:18:11.719
Personally, I find this
extremely insulting.

01:18:11.721 --> 01:18:15.022
Well, we have someone
who disagrees with you on this.

01:18:15.024 --> 01:18:17.458
We have live, via satellite,
Mr. Aaron Stafford

01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:20.094
who is
the KMMBR station manager.

01:18:20.096 --> 01:18:22.963
Aaron, thanks for joining us.
Would you care to comment?

01:18:22.965 --> 01:18:24.432
[bleep] bastard.

01:18:24.434 --> 01:18:27.735
Excuse me, I, I'm not sure
what kind of a smear campaign

01:18:27.737 --> 01:18:30.204
you're tryin' to run here,
but, uh, I don't believe

01:18:30.206 --> 01:18:32.907
you and I have ever met.

01:18:32.909 --> 01:18:35.242
We received a tape from Aaron
this morning.

01:18:35.244 --> 01:18:37.078
Let's play some of that footage.

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:39.146
But, folks,
what you're about to see

01:18:39.148 --> 01:18:40.848
is extremely graphic.

01:18:40.850 --> 01:18:44.118
Viewer discretion
is strongly advised.

01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:47.054
- Go now.
- It's quite an ancient ritual.

01:18:47.056 --> 01:18:49.490
You're the first humans
we've ever allowed to see this.

01:18:49.492 --> 01:18:51.726
Then why don't you want us
filming it?

01:18:51.728 --> 01:18:54.161
I don't think the public
in general's ready to witness

01:18:54.163 --> 01:18:56.964
this particular ceremony.
Do you?

01:18:56.966 --> 01:18:58.866
Well, shall we begin?

01:18:58.868 --> 01:19:00.901
My dear,
why don't you do the honors?

01:19:00.903 --> 01:19:03.871
- Thank you.
- No, please, no!

01:19:03.873 --> 01:19:06.774
[screaming]

01:19:07.509 --> 01:19:10.044
<i>[indistinct chatter]</i>

01:19:10.046 --> 01:19:11.946
[screaming]

01:19:13.949 --> 01:19:16.250
I never get to make a wish.

01:19:16.252 --> 01:19:20.221
Hey, Benny, you wanna see
what it, see what it looks like?

01:19:20.223 --> 01:19:22.089
I'm welcome anytime.

01:19:22.091 --> 01:19:24.191
<i>[groaning]</i>

01:19:24.193 --> 01:19:26.127
Ah! Mornin', boys.

01:19:26.129 --> 01:19:28.796
How about that close-up?

01:19:28.798 --> 01:19:32.099
After tonight, the whole world
will see this footage.

01:19:35.771 --> 01:19:38.038
And they will find you...

01:19:39.508 --> 01:19:44.311
and they'll take your
miserable, blood-sucking body

01:19:44.313 --> 01:19:47.381
and they'll rip you apart.

01:19:47.383 --> 01:19:49.283
<i>[Paul]
What about that, Samuel?</i>

01:19:49.285 --> 01:19:51.085
Care to comment to our viewers?

01:19:57.793 --> 01:19:59.226
[growling]

01:20:01.930 --> 01:20:04.565
Just keep the camera rolling.
The footage is gonna be amazing.

01:20:08.003 --> 01:20:11.438
I never stop rolling... bitch.

01:20:14.943 --> 01:20:17.812
We don't wanna hurt anyone
in any way, shape or form.

01:20:21.883 --> 01:20:24.084
Were you filming earlier
when we were arguing?

01:20:24.086 --> 01:20:25.419
<i>[Benny]
Of course not.</i>

01:20:30.225 --> 01:20:31.525
Is that camera off?

01:20:31.527 --> 01:20:33.093
<i>[Benny]
Oh, yeah, i-it's off.</i>

01:20:37.332 --> 01:20:40.868
I guess I'll have to get used
to having a camera around.

01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:41.969
Good.

01:20:45.473 --> 01:20:47.274
<i>- How do I look?
- Good.</i>

01:20:47.276 --> 01:20:48.909
Yeah? Cool.

01:20:53.348 --> 01:20:55.316
Do I look like I have fangs?

01:20:55.318 --> 01:20:56.584
Go, go!

01:21:03.291 --> 01:21:04.491
