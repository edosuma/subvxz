WEBVTT

00:00.590 --> 00:02.157
You were incredibly successful.

00:02.191 --> 00:04.560
One of the prettiest paint jobs
I've seen on the show.

00:04.594 --> 00:07.362
You've created these dimensions.
It's very smart.

00:07.397 --> 00:08.864
Thank you very much.

00:08.898 --> 00:10.399
Previously on <i> Face Off...</i>

00:10.433 --> 00:13.902
Logan's beautiful body paint
carried him to victory,

00:13.937 --> 00:16.505
and Rob became Team Rayce's
third straight artist

00:16.539 --> 00:18.173
to be sent home.

00:21.477 --> 00:23.545
Now nine artists remain,

00:23.580 --> 00:26.014
and tonight they will tackle
a terrifying challenge

00:26.049 --> 00:27.482
for a movie legend,

00:27.517 --> 00:28.617
Clive Barker.

00:28.651 --> 00:30.152
Hello,<i> Face Off</i> contestants.

00:31.421 --> 00:32.387
Oh, shit.

00:32.421 --> 00:33.555
My mold's cracked.

00:33.590 --> 00:35.257
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

00:35.291 --> 00:36.425
How did this happen?

00:36.459 --> 00:40.095
My face is a frickin' disaster.

00:40.129 --> 00:41.964
I do not know
what I'm looking at.

00:41.998 --> 00:44.499
In the end, only
one will win a VIP trip

00:44.534 --> 00:46.068
from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up

00:46.102 --> 00:48.870
to one of their 85
international locations,

00:48.905 --> 00:51.840
a brand-new 2015 Fiat 500,

00:51.874 --> 00:53.909
and $100,000.

00:55.578 --> 00:57.446

01:38.020 --> 01:39.521
- Congrats on that win.
- Thanks.

01:39.555 --> 01:41.256
I got to celebrate
for about five minutes,

01:41.290 --> 01:43.058
until I found out
Rob was going home.

01:43.092 --> 01:46.194
Adam and I are the only ones
left on Team Rayce,

01:46.229 --> 01:48.463
so it's time for other teams
to start losing people.

01:48.497 --> 01:49.531
All right.

01:49.565 --> 01:51.066
I hope I can keep bringing it,

01:51.100 --> 01:52.901
but it's gonna be tough.

01:59.642 --> 02:01.176
Whiskey A Go Go.

02:01.210 --> 02:02.277
That's cool.

02:02.311 --> 02:03.478
This place is legendary.

02:03.512 --> 02:04.579
All right.

02:04.614 --> 02:05.947
So I'm pretty excited for this.

02:10.752 --> 02:12.254
Hey, guys.

02:12.288 --> 02:16.157
Welcome to the most legendary
music venue on the Sunset Strip,

02:16.192 --> 02:19.594
the world-famous Whisky A Go Go.

02:19.629 --> 02:24.065
Since 1964, this stage has
featured incredible performances

02:24.100 --> 02:26.301
from iconic bands
like The Doors,

02:26.335 --> 02:28.904
Led Zeppelin, The Ramones,
and The Sex Pistols.

02:28.938 --> 02:29.938
Wow.

02:29.972 --> 02:31.206
Are you guys ready to rock?

02:31.240 --> 02:32.540
Yes!

02:32.575 --> 02:34.943
Good, because this week's
Spotlight Challenge

02:34.977 --> 02:39.481
is inspired by a true master
of the macabre.

02:39.515 --> 02:42.183
He has spawned some of the most
terrifying characters

02:42.218 --> 02:43.685
in the history of horror films,

02:43.719 --> 02:48.423
including Candyman
and <i> Hellraiser's</i> Pinhead.

02:48.457 --> 02:49.925
Clive Barker.

02:49.959 --> 02:50.992
Wow.

02:54.163 --> 02:58.133
Not only am I a huge horror fan.

02:58.167 --> 03:00.969
I am a massive <i> Hellraiser</i> fan.

03:01.003 --> 03:02.504
So I'm pumped.

03:02.538 --> 03:03.772
So in the 1980s,

03:03.806 --> 03:06.775
Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees
and Michael Myers

03:06.809 --> 03:09.277
terrified audiences
as silent killers

03:09.312 --> 03:10.979
hell-bent on destruction.

03:11.013 --> 03:14.716
However, in Clive's
now-classic film <i> Hellraiser,</i>

03:14.750 --> 03:17.519
he essentially redefined
the cinematic villain

03:17.553 --> 03:20.655
by making Pinhead
intelligent, eloquent,

03:20.690 --> 03:23.124
and, best of all, stylish.

03:23.159 --> 03:27.195
Perhaps it's best if you hear it
from Clive himself.

03:29.365 --> 03:31.433
Hello,<i> Face Off</i> contestants.

03:31.467 --> 03:32.767
I'm Clive Barker,

03:32.802 --> 03:35.070
and I'm very excited
about this challenge.

03:35.104 --> 03:37.739
When I was making demons
for a new age,

03:37.773 --> 03:39.441
it was the punk clubs I went to

03:39.475 --> 03:41.676
where I looked
for fresh inspiration,

03:41.711 --> 03:43.211
fresh blood if you will.

03:43.245 --> 03:45.246
I would love to see you
create something new.

03:45.281 --> 03:47.215
Go to the very cutting edge
of current fashion,

03:47.249 --> 03:51.586
and marry that with images that
are startling and terrifying.

03:51.620 --> 03:53.488
Have fun.

03:53.522 --> 03:55.423
So for this week's challenge,

03:55.458 --> 03:57.926
like Clive,
you'll find your inspiration

03:57.960 --> 04:01.396
from today's
futuristic fashions.

04:07.536 --> 04:09.704
Oh, this is so cool.

04:17.846 --> 04:20.115
Your Spotlight Challenge
is to choose

04:20.149 --> 04:23.151
one of these stunning
avant-garde outfits

04:23.185 --> 04:25.787
and use it as an inspiration
for your very own

04:25.821 --> 04:30.125
stylish and intelligent
horror villain.

04:30.159 --> 04:32.260
Your villains will be wearing
these outfits

04:32.294 --> 04:33.561
on the reveal stage.

04:33.596 --> 04:35.163
And by choosing the outfit,

04:35.197 --> 04:39.434
you're also choosing your model
for this week's challenge.

04:39.468 --> 04:42.003
Jamie, you're up first.

04:42.038 --> 04:43.605
Megan.

04:43.639 --> 04:45.006
Matt.

04:45.041 --> 04:46.875
Sarah.

04:46.909 --> 04:48.510
Elena.

04:48.544 --> 04:50.011
Alex.

04:50.046 --> 04:51.613
Naele.

04:51.647 --> 04:53.281
Augustine.

04:53.315 --> 04:54.783
Kerstin.

04:54.817 --> 04:56.184
Come on, Kodi.

04:59.655 --> 05:02.357
All right, guys,
in true muse fashion,

05:02.391 --> 05:05.226
your models will stay with you
while you work on your designs.

05:05.261 --> 05:06.227
Good luck.

05:06.262 --> 05:07.529
Bye.

05:11.634 --> 05:12.600
Turn around.

05:12.635 --> 05:14.302
I'm looking at Kodi's outfit,

05:14.336 --> 05:16.738
and I find a shape
that is just different,

05:16.772 --> 05:18.239
and I want to run with it.

05:18.274 --> 05:20.542
So my concept is a fallen angel

05:20.576 --> 05:23.745
who is cursed with a cage
around his head.

05:23.779 --> 05:25.647
So your head will be,
like, right there,

05:25.681 --> 05:28.216
and this is gonna go over it.

05:28.250 --> 05:29.284
It's almost spider-like.

05:29.318 --> 05:30.485
- Mm-hmm.
- You know?

05:30.519 --> 05:32.587
So I was thinking
we can go black widow-ish.

05:32.621 --> 05:33.588
Yeah.

05:33.622 --> 05:34.889
My concept is a female

05:34.924 --> 05:37.592
who has been scorned by men,

05:37.626 --> 05:39.894
so she attracts them
through her beauty

05:39.929 --> 05:41.062
and then kills them.

05:41.097 --> 05:42.564
I'm so excited.

05:45.334 --> 05:46.734
Such a weird combination,

05:46.769 --> 05:50.371
old relic necklace
and the futuristic jacket.

05:50.406 --> 05:52.841
This character
needs to be intelligent,

05:52.875 --> 05:54.909
but also scary and creepy.

05:54.944 --> 05:56.411
So my concept is a demon

05:56.445 --> 05:58.813
that goes after people
that wear this amulet

05:58.848 --> 06:00.048
and kills them.

06:00.082 --> 06:02.150
His whole head
is one giant mouth

06:02.184 --> 06:03.918
with finger-like appendages

06:03.953 --> 06:06.020
that rip the souls
out of its victims.

06:09.249 --> 06:10.625
Yeah.

06:10.659 --> 06:12.127
Look at me.

06:12.161 --> 06:13.428
Ooh, that's cool.

06:13.462 --> 06:15.230
My character is very vain,

06:15.264 --> 06:18.199
very obsessed
with plastic surgery.

06:18.234 --> 06:20.502
Then she starts going
under her own knife.

06:20.536 --> 06:22.403
I also want to give her a mask.

06:22.438 --> 06:25.340
So she appears to be
super sleek and stylish,

06:25.374 --> 06:27.075
then she takes off the mask

06:27.109 --> 06:30.545
to reveal the ultra,
ultra nastiness.

06:30.579 --> 06:33.381
With how fierce you are, girl,
it's gonna be so rad.

06:34.650 --> 06:35.683
All right, thanks a lot.

06:35.718 --> 06:37.318
- I'll see you soon.
- Yep.

06:44.793 --> 06:45.760
We get to the lab.

06:45.794 --> 06:47.195
We have 5 1/2 hours today.

06:47.229 --> 06:49.631
And I really want
to sculpt to finish the face

06:49.665 --> 06:52.133
and block out that extreme cowl,

06:52.168 --> 06:53.801
because if it doesn't
look good in clay,

06:53.836 --> 06:55.670
I want to have enough time
to scrap it

06:55.704 --> 06:57.805
and create something else.

06:57.840 --> 07:00.241
Clive Barker said, "We want
to see something different."

07:00.276 --> 07:02.577
So I'm gonna try
something different.

07:03.913 --> 07:06.614
- Ooh, hey.
- Hello, guys.

07:06.649 --> 07:08.616
That's a cool costume.

07:08.651 --> 07:11.653
Right now I don't have
a solid concept.

07:11.687 --> 07:13.621
I'm feeling like
there's not a whole lot

07:13.656 --> 07:16.024
that I can do with this
without going too obvious.

07:16.058 --> 07:17.625
So I'm getting
a little frustrated.

07:17.660 --> 07:18.793
So that's what I'm stuck with.

07:18.827 --> 07:20.128
No, it's not "stuck with."

07:20.162 --> 07:23.298
You've been given an opportunity
to expand on it.

07:23.332 --> 07:26.067
Stephanie is having some
serious conceptual problems,

07:26.101 --> 07:28.436
and I implore her
just to take some time

07:28.470 --> 07:30.838
and think about it
before starting to sculpt.

07:30.873 --> 07:34.042
I kind of want to just start
throwing clay down and playing.

07:41.016 --> 07:42.417
I think this
is a cool challenge,

07:42.451 --> 07:44.385
to kind of create things
that are just bizarre.

07:44.420 --> 07:46.554
Mine has this big silver tutu,

07:46.589 --> 07:49.824
so I come up
with this metal-like surface

07:49.858 --> 07:52.627
that is encapsulating
the back of her head,

07:52.661 --> 07:56.097
which is gonna be
this leather-bound skull cap.

07:56.131 --> 07:57.599
And I'm feeling
pretty good about it.

08:01.503 --> 08:04.072
I think I've landed
on a theme of poisons.

08:04.106 --> 08:06.207
My character's going to be
a snake charmer

08:06.242 --> 08:07.942
who has turned killer

08:07.977 --> 08:11.112
and has developed
an immunity to venom.

08:11.146 --> 08:14.582
He's going to look sickly
and anemic and have boils.

08:14.617 --> 08:17.051
And to suggest his intelligence,

08:17.086 --> 08:19.053
I've actually come up
with this grid-like pattern

08:19.088 --> 08:20.455
down both sides of the arms.

08:20.489 --> 08:21.723
It's a means of cataloging

08:21.757 --> 08:23.925
all the different poisons
that he creates.

08:23.959 --> 08:26.995
The one thing I'd suggest
is making bigger grids...

08:27.029 --> 08:27.996
Yeah.

08:28.030 --> 08:29.097
Just so from afar it doesn't

08:29.131 --> 08:30.632
read like a busy
mess kind of a thing.

08:30.666 --> 08:31.633
Does that make sense?

08:31.667 --> 08:33.067
Yeah, good point.

08:36.572 --> 08:40.140
I picked the costume
that screams "post-apocalyptic."

08:40.174 --> 08:42.543
And I'm doing a demon character.

08:42.578 --> 08:45.780
But I want to make sure visually
he looks completely different

08:45.814 --> 08:49.784
than what you would
necessarily expect of a demon.

08:54.356 --> 08:56.057
Hi, everybody.

08:56.091 --> 08:57.725
- Hey.
- Hi.

08:57.760 --> 08:59.494
So it looks very interesting.

08:59.528 --> 09:01.829
She's pretty much
a South American goddess

09:01.864 --> 09:02.964
that was resurrected,

09:02.998 --> 09:05.967
and she kills people
by turning them to gold.

09:06.001 --> 09:07.435
Are you meaning this as a hat?

09:07.469 --> 09:10.305
Some kind of headdress,
but it's also a part of her.

09:10.339 --> 09:12.707
I would blend this off
onto her nose,

09:12.741 --> 09:14.876
and then it actually
becomes her.

09:14.910 --> 09:16.010
Okay.

09:16.045 --> 09:17.378
She comes out kind of seeming

09:17.413 --> 09:18.846
all nice and pretty
and beautiful...

09:18.881 --> 09:19.981
Right.

09:20.015 --> 09:21.783
Then reveal this
nasty, nasty mouth.

09:21.817 --> 09:23.351
You could even
put a little blood there

09:23.385 --> 09:24.352
and shoot a little water,

09:24.386 --> 09:25.987
and it'll just kind of drip.

09:26.021 --> 09:29.624
Then it really looks horror
when that piece comes off.

09:29.658 --> 09:31.793
What are you pounding on?

09:31.827 --> 09:33.294
- A cowl.
- A cowl.

09:33.329 --> 09:35.496
I've been battling
the concept all day.

09:35.531 --> 09:36.931
Let's see what
you're doing there.

09:36.965 --> 09:38.499
Right now you've got
a head piece

09:38.534 --> 09:40.301
with nothing going on here.

09:40.336 --> 09:42.203
An interesting
thing to do would be

09:42.237 --> 09:44.706
put little hooks
on the ends of these things

09:44.740 --> 09:45.940
so it looks like it's hooked

09:45.974 --> 09:47.542
into her skin
all the way around.

09:47.576 --> 09:48.543
Yeah, that's an idea.

09:48.577 --> 09:49.577
- Go for it.
- Ehh...

09:49.611 --> 09:50.745
Go for it, you know.

09:50.779 --> 09:52.380
Listen.

09:52.414 --> 09:54.082
You're on the way;
You're on the way.

09:54.116 --> 09:57.285
The idea is, put one big hole
in the back of his head.

09:57.319 --> 09:59.120
It's almost like
he has these appendages

09:59.154 --> 10:01.022
that sucks the souls
through this hole.

10:01.056 --> 10:02.123
Mm-hmm.

10:02.157 --> 10:03.524
I think
you need to think somewhere

10:03.559 --> 10:05.393
of having something into it

10:05.427 --> 10:07.862
that is either pulling skin

10:07.896 --> 10:12.500
or something that is going
to read as horror.

10:12.534 --> 10:13.501
Mm-hmm.

10:13.535 --> 10:14.535
Thanks, everybody.

10:14.570 --> 10:15.570
- See ya.
- Thank you.

10:15.604 --> 10:17.305
Bye, thank you.

10:20.576 --> 10:22.710
I'm really embarrassed
that Mr. Westmore came through

10:22.745 --> 10:24.612
and I didn't have anything
to show him.

10:31.021 --> 10:34.589
It's frustrating because I feel
like this should be my element.

10:34.623 --> 10:35.723
I'm a haunter.

10:35.758 --> 10:37.625
I do scary all the time.

10:37.659 --> 10:39.160
This shouldn't be that hard.

10:40.763 --> 10:42.430
I can't not make anything.

10:42.464 --> 10:46.033
I can't say, "Oh, give me
another day to think about it."

10:46.068 --> 10:47.235
Stupid.

10:47.269 --> 10:48.936
And at this point
in the competition,

10:48.971 --> 10:51.539
if you don't make something
really cool,

10:51.573 --> 10:53.307
you could be going home.

11:00.782 --> 11:02.550
So, it's day one
of our Clive Barker challenge,

11:02.584 --> 11:05.252
and I'm having trouble,
like, nailing down

11:05.287 --> 11:06.554
a solid concept.

11:06.588 --> 11:08.823
And I'm just super frustrated.

11:08.857 --> 11:10.625
What parts of that do you like?

11:10.659 --> 11:12.893
I'm definitely
worried about Stephanie.

11:12.928 --> 11:14.695
She's such a good
concept person,

11:14.730 --> 11:17.932
and for her to struggle,
it just breaks my heart.

11:17.966 --> 11:20.167
I decide to just keep concepting

11:20.202 --> 11:21.369
for the rest of day one.

11:21.403 --> 11:22.436
No more sculpting.

11:22.471 --> 11:24.438
I have 9 1/2 hours tomorrow.

11:24.473 --> 11:26.407
And hopefully I'll get it done.

11:30.412 --> 11:32.313
Do something like this,

11:32.347 --> 11:33.848
not just... boom... into it.

11:33.882 --> 11:36.050
It's just that subtle
change of form.

11:36.084 --> 11:38.252
Jamie is having some
trouble refining the face,

11:38.286 --> 11:41.355
so I keep pointing out
some things just to clean up.

11:41.390 --> 11:45.226
Maybe you want to
get a little bit more.

11:45.260 --> 11:46.427
Oh, yeah, down...

11:46.461 --> 11:47.595
- In here.
- Uh-huh.

11:47.629 --> 11:49.497
And we talk about incorporating

11:49.531 --> 11:51.098
elements of the spider

11:51.133 --> 11:54.435
to be a little bit more
into the Clive Barker universe.

11:54.469 --> 11:55.436
We'll see.

11:59.374 --> 12:01.876
Just keep refining;
Get all the details.

12:01.910 --> 12:03.144
- I got to get going.
- Okay.

12:03.178 --> 12:04.645
And have fun, most importantly.

12:04.680 --> 12:05.646
Okay.

12:05.681 --> 12:06.881
I'm leaving.

12:06.915 --> 12:08.315
It's time for the coaches
to leave,

12:08.350 --> 12:09.617
and I'm pretty confident

12:09.651 --> 12:12.420
with what both Adam and Logan
have done today.

12:12.454 --> 12:13.888
But at the same time,

12:13.922 --> 12:16.557
I only have two artists
left on my team,

12:16.591 --> 12:19.460
so I'm really not feeling
relaxed in this stage.

12:19.494 --> 12:20.728
Just win, okay?

12:20.762 --> 12:22.263
- Yeah, Yeah.
- Just win.

12:22.297 --> 12:24.198
Have fun.

12:24.232 --> 12:25.599
How you feeling about it?

12:25.634 --> 12:26.634
Pretty good.

12:26.668 --> 12:28.169
Struggling a little bit.

12:28.203 --> 12:30.104
Think I'm headed
in the right direction, though.

12:30.138 --> 12:32.039
I decide to follow
Mr. Westmore's advice

12:32.074 --> 12:35.776
and work on making the face
look a little less human...

12:35.811 --> 12:37.111
a lot less human.

12:38.947 --> 12:40.548
Have to do a lot more
detail sculpting,

12:40.582 --> 12:42.650
but I feel really good
about this concept,

12:42.684 --> 12:44.485
and I think I have
a good chance.

12:44.519 --> 12:46.153
I'd really like to win this one.

12:46.188 --> 12:47.655
Yeah, same.

12:47.689 --> 12:49.557
30 minutes, everybody.

12:57.432 --> 12:58.999
That's time, everybody.

13:11.179 --> 13:14.381
It's day two, and I'm feeling
a little better than day one.

13:14.416 --> 13:15.750
I know what I'm gonna do now.

13:15.784 --> 13:17.518
Basically it's gonna be
gross skin,

13:17.552 --> 13:19.887
like, peeling up
and being, like, hooked forward.

13:19.921 --> 13:20.888
Ooh, okay.

13:20.922 --> 13:22.189
My concept for this character

13:22.224 --> 13:23.524
is some sort of seer,

13:23.558 --> 13:25.626
and then the way she kills
is that she tells people

13:25.660 --> 13:27.228
their futures
and how they're gonna die,

13:27.262 --> 13:28.562
and if they try to avoid it,

13:28.597 --> 13:30.364
then she ends up
killing them herself.

13:30.398 --> 13:31.532
The only advice I'd give

13:31.566 --> 13:33.601
is to try to keep her
somewhat beautiful.

13:33.635 --> 13:34.802
Pretty, yeah.

13:34.836 --> 13:36.637
I have to have something
sculpted, molded,

13:36.671 --> 13:39.573
and ready for foam today.

13:39.608 --> 13:42.743
So I decide to just go
with a cowl

13:42.778 --> 13:44.945
that's manageable for me
in one day.

13:49.084 --> 13:51.118
Today I've got a lot to do.

13:51.153 --> 13:52.620
I have to get the face done.

13:52.654 --> 13:54.188
I also have to get
these arm pieces done.

13:54.222 --> 13:55.422
These are gonna be, like,

13:55.457 --> 13:56.924
the different poisons
that he injects...

13:56.958 --> 13:58.025
Mm-hmm.

13:58.059 --> 13:59.193
And the different things
it causes?

13:59.227 --> 14:00.194
Yeah.

14:00.228 --> 14:02.163
I'm sculpting with monster clay,

14:02.197 --> 14:03.430
which is a wax-based clay,

14:03.465 --> 14:05.533
and it's great for fine detail.

14:05.567 --> 14:08.035
You can melt it
with a heat gun or torch,

14:08.069 --> 14:10.704
and you can get certain effects
that I think will really help

14:10.739 --> 14:13.374
with the character design
that I've come up with.

14:13.408 --> 14:15.009
I like what you're doing here.

14:18.213 --> 14:19.380
I think it's cool.

14:19.414 --> 14:20.948
I'd start working
on the face, you know?

14:20.982 --> 14:23.350
Well, I was gonna mold this
and then go work on the face.

14:23.385 --> 14:24.919
So I've got my cowl sculpted.

14:24.953 --> 14:27.655
Now I need to get it molded
as soon as possible,

14:27.689 --> 14:31.025
because I still need
to make a face piece.

14:31.059 --> 14:33.327
The overall design for
Ben's cowl is really awesome.

14:33.361 --> 14:35.796
Hopefully the face
looks equally cool.

14:38.567 --> 14:40.501
No, the string
isn't long enough.

14:40.535 --> 14:43.871
For the cowl,
I want to fabricate a cage

14:43.905 --> 14:46.140
that interlocks with the face.

14:46.174 --> 14:48.475
And I'm really inspired
by string art.

14:48.510 --> 14:49.910
One thing that
was really important

14:49.945 --> 14:51.312
is, like, make sure
it's something

14:51.346 --> 14:52.646
that Clive hasn't seen before.

14:52.681 --> 14:54.114
- Yeah.
- So, I just...

14:54.149 --> 14:55.783
I haven't seen
anything like this before.

14:55.817 --> 15:00.321
It's going to have a wonderful
profile and silhouette.

15:04.359 --> 15:05.326
Sweet.

15:05.360 --> 15:06.460
I finish my cowl,

15:06.494 --> 15:08.062
and I'm actually
really pleased with it.

15:08.096 --> 15:11.165
Now I have to get it molded
and out the door.

15:11.199 --> 15:13.033
So it's really important
that I take my time,

15:13.068 --> 15:14.568
because it's gonna be
a two-part mold,

15:14.603 --> 15:17.371
and if one half
is slightly overlapping,

15:17.405 --> 15:18.839
it'll lock my mold.

15:24.346 --> 15:26.881
It doesn't look like this
is all stretched skin.

15:26.915 --> 15:28.148
Mm-hmm.

15:28.183 --> 15:30.885
Darla is still kind of
struggling with her cowl.

15:30.919 --> 15:33.287
She's sculpting
the stretched skin idea,

15:33.321 --> 15:34.688
but, for whatever reason,

15:34.723 --> 15:36.557
it doesn't seem
to be translating.

15:36.591 --> 15:39.760
So I just grab a head
and I start sculpting on it

15:39.794 --> 15:41.829
to show her how
to sculpt wrinkles.

15:41.863 --> 15:43.797
These wrinkles,
they go all the way.

15:48.236 --> 15:49.270
Yeah.

15:49.304 --> 15:50.271
We're leaving.

15:50.305 --> 15:52.072
All righty.

15:52.107 --> 15:53.874
Cool, good luck.

15:53.909 --> 15:54.942
- Awesome.
- Okay?

15:54.976 --> 15:56.010
Sweet, thank you.

15:56.044 --> 15:57.544
Leaving day two,
I think everybody

15:57.579 --> 15:59.446
seems to be in a good place,

15:59.481 --> 16:01.582
but I'm still worried
about Jamie.

16:01.616 --> 16:03.317
Her face has to look beautiful

16:03.351 --> 16:05.352
in order for this character
to work,

16:05.387 --> 16:07.354
and right now she still has
a long way to go on it.

16:07.389 --> 16:08.656
- Bye, guys.
- Keep kicking ass.

16:08.690 --> 16:10.424
Good luck.

16:22.170 --> 16:25.539
I get my cowl molded,
and I start to open it.

16:25.573 --> 16:26.707
Oh, shit.

16:26.741 --> 16:29.677
I notice that my mold's cracked.

16:29.711 --> 16:31.779
And I'm like, shit.

16:31.813 --> 16:33.781
I'm trying not to freak out.

16:36.084 --> 16:37.584
I'm looking at the crack
in the mold,

16:37.619 --> 16:38.986
and it's a pretty big crack.

16:39.020 --> 16:40.821
I mean, I've seen
some big cracks.

16:40.855 --> 16:42.389
This is the biggest crack
I've seen.

16:45.026 --> 16:46.293
This is my only piece,

16:46.328 --> 16:48.362
and if I mess this up,

16:48.396 --> 16:51.165
I'm gonna go out on stage
with nothing.

16:51.199 --> 16:52.766
So this needs to get fixed.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.401
Mold cracked in half.

17:02.435 --> 17:04.603
It's day two
of our horror villain challenge,

17:04.637 --> 17:06.305
and my mold's cracked.

17:06.339 --> 17:08.339
I'm freaking out
because it's just all I got.

17:08.374 --> 17:09.441
This is my only piece.

17:09.476 --> 17:11.510
You got to be fucking
kidding me.

17:11.544 --> 17:15.012
I grab a plumber's epoxy
and use it to seal the crack.

17:15.048 --> 17:16.248
I got it fixed, but I'm worried

17:16.281 --> 17:17.683
I'm gonna have
a lot of patchwork

17:17.717 --> 17:18.717
on application day.

17:23.756 --> 17:25.124
Man, you need to start molding.

17:25.157 --> 17:26.258
I know.

17:26.291 --> 17:27.992
Last time I was
in an individual challenge,

17:28.027 --> 17:30.529
I sacrificed sculpting detail

17:30.563 --> 17:32.264
in order to get
the molds done on time.

17:32.298 --> 17:33.932
It was a really bad idea.

17:33.967 --> 17:35.334
I don't want to do that again.

17:35.368 --> 17:37.269
So I don't see how
you're not freaking out.

17:37.303 --> 17:39.104
What's the worst
that could happen?

17:39.139 --> 17:40.772
You're not gonna get
your cowl out.

17:40.807 --> 17:43.575
Ben's looking over at me
and thinks that I'm crazy,

17:43.610 --> 17:45.544
but I'd rather risk it.

17:45.578 --> 17:48.380
I just want to make sure
I put out something good.

17:50.183 --> 17:54.686
So now it's time to work on my
futuristic surgical fetish mask.

17:54.721 --> 17:57.623
It needs to be smooth,
sleek, and sharp

17:57.657 --> 18:00.025
to reveal the nastiness
underneath.

18:00.059 --> 18:02.427
The mask is gonna work
with my wardrobe

18:02.462 --> 18:05.564
to add that Clive Barker element
to my character.

18:05.598 --> 18:08.700
Looking pretty freaking cool
right now.

18:12.872 --> 18:14.673
That's time, everybody.

18:14.707 --> 18:15.974
I'm feeling okay.

18:16.009 --> 18:18.844
I've got a general idea
of what the character is

18:18.878 --> 18:20.179
and what it's going
to look like.

18:20.213 --> 18:22.581
I just have to attack it
for application day.

18:29.255 --> 18:30.656
- Nice shirt.
- You too.

18:30.690 --> 18:31.890
It's application day.

18:31.925 --> 18:33.292
We have four hours in the lab,

18:33.326 --> 18:35.894
one hour for Last Looks.

18:37.263 --> 18:38.363
Oh, my God.

18:38.398 --> 18:41.200
My face is a frickin' disaster.

18:41.234 --> 18:43.035
How did this happen?

18:43.069 --> 18:44.937
I don't know, just could be
one of those things.

18:44.971 --> 18:47.306
It has the worst second skinning

18:47.340 --> 18:49.208
I have ever encountered.

18:49.242 --> 18:50.242
So you can...

18:50.276 --> 18:51.310
Oh, my God, that's so...

18:51.344 --> 18:52.444
work it in.

18:52.478 --> 18:53.745
Kelly's face is mutilated.

18:53.780 --> 18:55.781
But to be honest,
I think it could help it.

18:55.815 --> 18:57.883
With the type of character
she's doing,

18:57.917 --> 18:59.451
That could be a happy accident,

18:59.485 --> 19:02.187
because if someone's
continuously cutting themselves,

19:02.222 --> 19:05.023
it wouldn't be
in such perfect symmetry.

19:05.058 --> 19:07.793
It would be a little bit more
sporadic and spontaneous.

19:07.827 --> 19:09.161
But, you know...

19:09.195 --> 19:10.996
It's okay; It's okay.
I can work with it.

19:11.030 --> 19:12.397
- She's mutilated.
- Yeah, she's mutilated.

19:12.432 --> 19:13.865
Got some of those cuts,
work it, part of your story.

19:13.900 --> 19:15.200
It might make it
more in the horror realm

19:15.235 --> 19:16.368
than the alien realm.

19:16.402 --> 19:17.803
Yeah.

19:24.877 --> 19:25.844
'Sup?

19:25.878 --> 19:27.079
- How you doing?
- Hey.

19:27.113 --> 19:29.314
So you have, like,
the back of your head too.

19:29.349 --> 19:30.582
Oh, it looks like a spider body.

19:30.617 --> 19:31.883
Yep.

19:31.918 --> 19:34.953
These are all test samples of
poisons on your arm.

19:34.988 --> 19:36.388
Ohh.

19:36.422 --> 19:37.789
Today I'm starting
with the arms.

19:37.824 --> 19:39.691
I know that I have to be
very delicate,

19:39.726 --> 19:42.561
otherwise I'm gonna be
tearing my prosthetics apart.

19:42.595 --> 19:43.996
Rotate in just a little bit.

19:44.030 --> 19:45.030
Thank you.

19:45.064 --> 19:46.331
So one arm at a time,

19:46.366 --> 19:47.933
I lay it down very carefully.

19:47.967 --> 19:49.034
They're fragile,

19:49.068 --> 19:50.269
especially where
the joint bends,

19:50.303 --> 19:52.704
so don't do any
excessive movements.

19:52.739 --> 19:55.007
I just hope they're able
to hold up

19:55.041 --> 19:56.708
between now
and the reveal stage.

20:03.850 --> 20:05.617
I'm cooling down the black mesh

20:05.652 --> 20:09.021
into the eye area
of the face prosthetic.

20:09.055 --> 20:11.790
Hopefully it will block out
my model's eyes completely

20:11.824 --> 20:14.359
and he'll still be able
to see through it perfectly.

20:24.971 --> 20:26.638
It came out pretty good.

20:26.673 --> 20:28.073
I am super relieved,

20:28.107 --> 20:30.876
because the crack I was
trying to fix on the cowl mold

20:30.910 --> 20:33.045
didn't even show up
in the piece.

20:33.079 --> 20:34.780
So, as far as these eyes,

20:34.814 --> 20:36.481
push them out and then cut them?

20:36.516 --> 20:37.949
This is what I'd do.

20:37.984 --> 20:39.618
Right now we're just making sure

20:39.652 --> 20:41.053
the eye slits are big enough.

20:41.087 --> 20:43.588
I'll come in, and then
I'll kind of ride the line.

20:43.623 --> 20:45.290
See what I'm doing there?

20:45.325 --> 20:46.458
Yeah.

20:49.329 --> 20:51.563
Come under your nose.

20:51.597 --> 20:52.864
I'm bouncing back and forth

20:52.899 --> 20:54.833
between sponging, airbrushing,

20:54.867 --> 20:58.804
and flicking just to break up
all of the solid colors.

20:58.838 --> 21:00.372
All right,
tilt your head up for me.

21:02.642 --> 21:04.009
I'm having to spend
a little more time

21:04.043 --> 21:06.345
on the area where the cowl
comes over the eye,

21:06.379 --> 21:08.213
because certain parts
are lifting

21:08.247 --> 21:10.015
and I have to give it back down.

21:10.049 --> 21:11.350
Stupid things.

21:11.384 --> 21:12.684
It's looking a little rough,

21:12.719 --> 21:16.054
but I can't let myself
get frustrated.

21:19.359 --> 21:21.360
Are you gonna paint
this whole thing black?

21:21.394 --> 21:24.162
Well, I was thinking of doing,
like, black under there

21:24.197 --> 21:25.931
and then a lighter tone
on the top.

21:25.965 --> 21:27.532
The paint scheme
I'm gonna go with is,

21:27.567 --> 21:29.601
dark colors come in
across the cowl piece

21:29.635 --> 21:30.936
all the way to the front
of the face

21:30.970 --> 21:32.437
and keep the front very light,

21:32.472 --> 21:33.605
because I don't want
to take away

21:33.639 --> 21:35.273
from the skin color aspect
of it.

21:35.308 --> 21:37.576
And then here on the face,
this his gonna be fun.

21:37.610 --> 21:39.644
I'm a little worried
about her pieces

21:39.679 --> 21:41.880
looking like
realistic skin texture,

21:41.914 --> 21:43.482
but hopefully
she can pull it off.

21:43.516 --> 21:44.883
Keep it scary but pretty.

21:44.917 --> 21:46.118
Yeah, I like that.

21:49.055 --> 21:50.655
Oh, gosh.

21:50.690 --> 21:52.357
I'm fumbling
with the webbing part

21:52.392 --> 21:55.127
of my cage
that's on top of the cowl.

21:55.161 --> 21:58.797
And the left side
starts falling.

21:58.831 --> 22:00.832
So now the string
is falling off,

22:00.867 --> 22:03.034
and it looks disastrous.

22:03.069 --> 22:05.303
I'm going home for this,
I'm telling you.

22:05.338 --> 22:07.806
This is atrocious.

22:07.840 --> 22:08.907
I look at the clock.

22:08.941 --> 22:11.376
I do not have time
to fumble with this.

22:11.411 --> 22:14.913
So I scrap it, and I decide
to throw feathers into it

22:14.947 --> 22:16.014
and just leave it.

22:16.048 --> 22:18.850
And I'll work
with the feathers later.

22:18.885 --> 22:19.985
Ten minutes.

22:26.058 --> 22:27.192
We're running out of time,

22:27.226 --> 22:28.927
and I'm so far behind on paint,

22:28.961 --> 22:30.328
I'm worried that I won't be able

22:30.363 --> 22:32.597
to actually complete
the full beauty makeup.

22:33.633 --> 22:34.633
It's gonna crack.

22:34.667 --> 22:35.834
You think it's gonna crack?

22:35.868 --> 22:37.235
I'm trying to do it
as fast as I can,

22:37.270 --> 22:39.371
'cause there's a lot to cover
on this thing.

22:42.108 --> 22:43.675
That's time, everybody.

22:43.709 --> 22:46.611
A big part of my concept
is the beauty aspect of it,

22:46.646 --> 22:48.413
so it's really important
to get that down.

22:48.448 --> 22:51.149
But now I've got to wait
until Last Looks,

22:51.184 --> 22:52.517
and now I'm worried.

23:00.528 --> 23:01.495
Come over here.

23:01.529 --> 23:02.562
Get out of the way.

23:02.597 --> 23:03.697
Let's get this done.

23:03.731 --> 23:05.365
It's Last Looks;
I have one hour left.

23:05.399 --> 23:07.234
And I have to finish
my paint job.

23:07.268 --> 23:09.069
The highlights and shadowing
aren't working.

23:09.103 --> 23:10.604
The skin tones aren't matching.

23:10.638 --> 23:11.938
I'm just struggling.

23:11.973 --> 23:15.542
Oh, God, all this disease
that I got to paint.

23:15.576 --> 23:16.743
I got to do your eyes.

23:16.777 --> 23:18.411
I'm rushing around
like a madhouse,

23:18.446 --> 23:20.213
trying to get
this beauty makeup done.

23:20.248 --> 23:21.248
Close.

23:24.218 --> 23:25.519
It's not gonna work.

23:25.553 --> 23:26.987
These teeth are not fitting.

23:27.021 --> 23:30.891
All I can do right now
is make that mouth look nasty.

23:30.925 --> 23:32.058
30 minutes.

23:40.501 --> 23:43.036
All right, time, everybody.

23:43.070 --> 23:44.471
Thanks, Kodi, good luck.

23:44.505 --> 23:45.872
I'm really worried,

23:45.907 --> 23:48.508
because it's not as finished
as I wanted it to be.

23:48.543 --> 23:51.478
So I'm just hoping
that I'm at least safe.

24:00.154 --> 24:03.623
Welcome to the <i> Face Off</i>
reveal stage.

24:03.658 --> 24:07.360
As you know, one of you
will be going home tonight.

24:07.395 --> 24:09.396
But before we see
your creations,

24:09.430 --> 24:11.798
say hello to our series judges.

24:11.832 --> 24:12.799
Glenn Hetrick.

24:12.833 --> 24:13.800
Good evening.

24:13.834 --> 24:14.801
Hello.

24:14.835 --> 24:15.802
Ve Neill.

24:15.836 --> 24:16.836
Hello, everybody.

24:16.871 --> 24:17.837
Hello, Ve.

24:17.872 --> 24:18.905
And Neville Page.

24:18.940 --> 24:20.140
Hi, guys.

24:20.174 --> 24:21.308
Hello.

24:21.342 --> 24:24.377
And joining us tonight
is a very special guest.

24:24.412 --> 24:25.545
He's the co-head

24:25.580 --> 24:27.714
of Clive Barker's
production company,

24:27.748 --> 24:29.149
Seraphim Films.

24:29.183 --> 24:32.352
Please give a warm welcome
to Mark Alan Miller.

24:33.521 --> 24:34.721
Pleasure to be here.

24:34.755 --> 24:36.189
Thank you so much
for being here.

24:36.223 --> 24:37.324
Thank you for having me.

24:37.358 --> 24:38.959
I'm extremely excited.

24:38.993 --> 24:40.927
He is Clive Barker's
right-hand man,

24:40.962 --> 24:42.829
so to hear what mark has to say

24:42.863 --> 24:45.198
is gonna be really interesting.

24:45.232 --> 24:47.567
All right, guys, this week
your Spotlight Challenge

24:47.602 --> 24:49.836
was to choose
an avant-garde outfit

24:49.870 --> 24:53.707
to inspire a stylish
and intelligent horror villain

24:53.741 --> 24:56.343
in the vein
of <i> Hellraiser's</i> Pinhead.

24:56.377 --> 24:59.112
So let's take a look
at your creations.

25:21.969 --> 25:23.169
I'm nervous.

25:23.204 --> 25:25.805
It looks a lot different
than everything else,

25:25.840 --> 25:27.974
which could be a bad thing
or a good thing.

25:49.664 --> 25:52.332
I definitely could have
done way better

25:52.366 --> 25:53.333
on this challenge.

25:53.367 --> 25:54.701
I know I'm on the bottom.

26:17.525 --> 26:18.625
I am a little bit worried

26:18.659 --> 26:20.794
that maybe the character
is not scary enough.

26:20.828 --> 26:22.562
But I am happy
with the way it looks,

26:22.596 --> 26:24.431
and hopefully
the judges like it.

26:46.687 --> 26:49.456
It is the best thing I
could picture in that outfit,

26:49.490 --> 26:51.958
so I'm like, "All right, cool,
mission accomplished."

27:14.615 --> 27:17.250
From far away,
I like the paint job.

27:17.284 --> 27:19.652
But up close, it's really rough.

27:19.687 --> 27:22.021
They're gonna see
all the mistakes in there.

27:42.109 --> 27:43.710
Even from a distance, I can see

27:43.744 --> 27:45.912
how much he's able
to emote with his face.

27:45.946 --> 27:47.981
Just giving
this really creepy vibe.

27:48.015 --> 27:49.783
And I'm hoping the judges agree.

28:11.005 --> 28:13.006
She's got this
creepy vibe to her.

28:13.040 --> 28:15.708
I see the white face
with the silver tips.

28:15.743 --> 28:17.277
And overall I'm pretty happy.

28:39.266 --> 28:41.134
I don't know
whether or not to think

28:41.168 --> 28:44.204
I am unique in the way it looks

28:44.238 --> 28:45.972
or if I'm completely off.

28:46.006 --> 28:47.307
I don't really know.

29:06.760 --> 29:08.494
She looks nasty!

29:08.529 --> 29:09.963
And I'm like, "You know,

29:09.997 --> 29:12.098
you're pretty fucked up, Kelly.

29:12.132 --> 29:13.399
Did all right."

29:19.373 --> 29:20.573
All right, judges,

29:20.608 --> 29:22.408
why don't you
take a closer look?

29:27.181 --> 29:29.883
There's no texture
in the prosthetic piece.

29:29.917 --> 29:30.984
It's not so much monstrous.

29:31.018 --> 29:32.585
It's more sympathetic.

29:34.588 --> 29:36.089
What is going on here?

29:36.123 --> 29:37.490
I don't know, but it's cool.

29:37.524 --> 29:38.925
It's beautiful coloring on it.

29:38.959 --> 29:40.560
Yeah, I love the paint job.

29:42.196 --> 29:44.898
This feels
like an alien character.

29:44.932 --> 29:46.232
I was gonna say the same thing.

29:46.267 --> 29:48.635
Yeah.

29:48.669 --> 29:51.404
I do love the originality
of this in sculpting.

29:51.438 --> 29:53.907
I would have liked to have
seen a lot more of this gold

29:53.941 --> 29:56.576
being brought down onto
all these highlighted areas.

29:57.578 --> 29:58.678
Oh, jeez.

29:58.712 --> 30:00.813
This does not even
resemble skin.

30:00.848 --> 30:04.083
This chin and nose and forehead

30:04.118 --> 30:06.219
don't say, "Clive Barker."

30:06.253 --> 30:08.321
I'm mainly worried
about the paint work.

30:08.355 --> 30:09.989
It's too flat.

30:10.024 --> 30:11.591
This could be a disaster.

30:15.329 --> 30:17.664
Tell us who made
your favorite horror villain

30:17.698 --> 30:20.667
tonight on Twitter
using #FaceOff

30:22.873 --> 30:25.241
This does not
even resemble skin.

30:25.276 --> 30:26.910
I am freaking out.

30:26.944 --> 30:29.212
The paint work is too flat.

30:29.246 --> 30:31.915
The quality of it
isn't where it needs to be.

30:36.554 --> 30:38.588
This is even better close
than it was far away.

30:38.622 --> 30:39.789
Yeah.

30:39.824 --> 30:42.025
This is the first time
I'm scared today.

30:42.059 --> 30:43.293
And that's good.

30:45.629 --> 30:47.997
I love these weird
asymmetrical shapes.

30:48.032 --> 30:50.233
All of these notes
tie into the wardrobe,

30:50.267 --> 30:51.468
and it's the only makeup

30:51.502 --> 30:53.203
that addresses that
so completely.

30:53.237 --> 30:54.237
Oh, yeah.

30:57.441 --> 31:00.510
Gets a little soft and full
through here,

31:00.544 --> 31:04.114
but up in here,
that's really well-handled.

31:07.551 --> 31:10.487
Oh, the eyes, it's creepy.

31:10.521 --> 31:12.355
She is creepy.

31:12.389 --> 31:13.490
We have pain.

31:13.524 --> 31:15.525
We have disgusting and sexy.

31:15.559 --> 31:17.193
I love it.

31:17.228 --> 31:18.328
Oh.

31:22.099 --> 31:25.068
Okay, the judges
have scored your creations.

31:25.102 --> 31:27.203
Let's find out
what they thought.

31:27.238 --> 31:29.038
Adam...

31:29.073 --> 31:30.974
Logan...

31:31.008 --> 31:32.776
Darla...

31:32.810 --> 31:35.211
Congratulations,
because you are all safe

31:35.246 --> 31:37.247
and can head back
to the makeup room.

31:37.248 --> 31:38.248
Thank you.

31:39.760 --> 31:41.210
Oh, my God.

31:43.921 --> 31:47.423
The rest of you were the best
and the worst this week.

31:47.458 --> 31:49.359
And the judges would like
to speak with each of you

31:49.393 --> 31:50.794
to learn more about your work.

31:50.828 --> 31:52.262
Julian, you're up.

31:57.902 --> 31:59.602
Give us the
backstory of this character

31:59.637 --> 32:02.672
and how Clive's work
inspired you to design this.

32:02.706 --> 32:03.973
Well, the first thing I noticed

32:04.008 --> 32:05.542
when I chose the costume
was the amulet,

32:05.576 --> 32:07.677
and I figured that that was
some sort of cursed object,

32:07.711 --> 32:10.180
and whoever wears it,
he comes after them.

32:10.214 --> 32:12.081
And his whole head
is a second mouth

32:12.116 --> 32:14.384
that rips the souls
out of his victims.

32:14.418 --> 32:18.388
I am absolutely thrilled
with what you did this week.

32:18.422 --> 32:21.090
I am a huge Clive Barker fan,

32:21.125 --> 32:22.692
and I think you did
an amazing job

32:22.726 --> 32:24.861
of working within his world.

32:24.895 --> 32:27.831
You're obviously a Clive fan,
and you know your stuff.

32:27.865 --> 32:28.832
Well done.

32:28.866 --> 32:30.033
Thank you.

32:30.067 --> 32:31.901
On a scale of one to ten
in the creepiness,

32:31.936 --> 32:33.970
he is a 15 1/2.

32:34.004 --> 32:35.338
I love the paint job.

32:35.372 --> 32:37.674
I think this character
was very successful.

32:37.708 --> 32:38.842
Thank you.

32:38.876 --> 32:40.476
I don't think
it's that creative.

32:40.511 --> 32:41.945
I think it's a very good
"now" design.

32:41.979 --> 32:44.681
I don't think it's
a very next-gen version

32:44.715 --> 32:46.716
of Clive Barker world.

32:46.750 --> 32:48.351
He's definitely scary.

32:48.385 --> 32:49.986
I do love the idea of the mouth.

32:50.020 --> 32:51.254
I love the jaw line.

32:51.288 --> 32:52.522
He's very cool.

32:52.556 --> 32:53.723
Thank you.

32:53.757 --> 32:55.491
Julian, if you'd please
step back.

32:55.526 --> 32:56.726
Thanks.

33:02.066 --> 33:04.367
Emily, please step up.

33:08.639 --> 33:11.941
Would you please tell us
how your avant-garde wardrobe

33:11.976 --> 33:13.409
inspired your character?

33:13.444 --> 33:17.747
I had the crow feather
and the chain mail skirt.

33:17.781 --> 33:20.617
So I decided to go
with a fallen angel.

33:20.651 --> 33:22.318
This is a great makeup.

33:22.353 --> 33:24.053
Thanks.

33:24.088 --> 33:26.289
I absolutely love the paint job,

33:26.323 --> 33:29.025
and the silhouette
on this character is phenomenal.

33:29.059 --> 33:30.393
Oh, thanks.

33:30.427 --> 33:33.229
What you've achieved is
something that's iconic

33:33.264 --> 33:35.265
and extraordinarily memorable.

33:35.299 --> 33:37.033
I think this is beautiful.

33:37.067 --> 33:38.534
Thank you.

33:38.569 --> 33:41.037
I'm not quite sure it falls
into the Clive Barker world,

33:41.071 --> 33:43.539
but I do think it is
something extraordinary.

33:43.574 --> 33:45.074
Thank you.

33:45.109 --> 33:47.010
Emily, you can step back.

33:47.044 --> 33:48.211
Thank you.

33:52.483 --> 33:53.549
All right,
let's talk to Stephanie.

33:53.584 --> 33:54.584
Okay.

33:59.857 --> 34:01.925
So tell us about
your Clive Barker character

34:01.959 --> 34:05.161
and how the fashion motivated
some of your choices.

34:05.195 --> 34:06.963
She's basically, like, a seer,

34:06.997 --> 34:09.866
but she was cursed into, like...

34:09.900 --> 34:12.435
I don't know, it just was
a much more twisted form

34:12.469 --> 34:14.270
than she had
originally intended.

34:14.304 --> 34:15.972
I don't think you know

34:16.005 --> 34:18.274
what it is that you were
trying to execute.

34:20.377 --> 34:23.513
It's so nonspecific
in terms of sculptural form

34:23.547 --> 34:26.516
that I simply do not know
what I'm looking at.

34:26.550 --> 34:27.650
Yeah.

34:27.685 --> 34:29.452
Another huge problem with this

34:29.485 --> 34:33.022
is, it is not conducive
to your model's facial features.

34:33.056 --> 34:36.225
You've weakened her chin,
which evokes sympathy,

34:36.260 --> 34:39.696
and it does not use
her jaw line or her nose

34:39.730 --> 34:43.666
to convey any of the things
that we were looking for.

34:43.701 --> 34:45.400
Stephanie, please step back.

34:50.975 --> 34:52.742
Kelly, you're next.

34:58.482 --> 35:00.683
Could you tell me a little
about your character?

35:00.718 --> 35:03.219
She was obsessed
with plastic surgery,

35:03.253 --> 35:07.023
so she is just continuously
under her own knife.

35:07.057 --> 35:10.293
Well, I'd like to applaud you
for marrying sex and violence.

35:12.062 --> 35:14.197
That's definitely a
big part of what we do.

35:14.231 --> 35:15.431
We have a new <i> Hellraiser</i>

35:15.466 --> 35:16.966
anthology comic book coming out,

35:17.001 --> 35:19.736
and I could very easily
see this character

35:19.770 --> 35:21.037
in one of those stories.

35:21.071 --> 35:22.038
Oh.

35:22.072 --> 35:24.073
The integration of your wardrobe

35:24.108 --> 35:25.975
through that vacu-form thing

35:26.010 --> 35:27.877
is an astounding touch.

35:27.911 --> 35:31.247
It brings the avant-garde
into the Clive Barker world.

35:31.281 --> 35:32.515
Thank you so much.

35:32.549 --> 35:34.550
That green dress
and the red hair

35:34.585 --> 35:36.185
are phenomenal together.

35:36.220 --> 35:41.290
She is the most disturbing thing
I have seen in ages.

35:41.325 --> 35:42.358
Kelly, thank you.

35:42.393 --> 35:43.359
You can step back.

35:43.394 --> 35:44.761
Yeah, girl.

35:50.501 --> 35:52.268
Jamie, please step forward.

35:58.942 --> 36:00.343
Please tell us how your wardrobe

36:00.377 --> 36:02.245
inspired this
Clive Barker character.

36:02.279 --> 36:04.280
I thought black widow lady

36:04.314 --> 36:06.849
who attracts people
through her beauty.

36:06.884 --> 36:08.551
The legs are coming out,

36:08.585 --> 36:11.154
grabbing the rest of her face.

36:11.188 --> 36:13.122
I am not thrilled
with this makeup.

36:15.325 --> 36:17.060
The spider growing out
of the back of her head

36:17.094 --> 36:18.227
and grabbing her skin,

36:18.262 --> 36:20.797
it just feels alien/monster-y

36:20.831 --> 36:24.734
in a way that's not part
of the Clive Barker mythology.

36:24.768 --> 36:25.968
That's okay.

36:26.003 --> 36:28.104
This paint job
is completely flat.

36:28.138 --> 36:29.572
It doesn't look like skin.

36:29.606 --> 36:30.740
This is a failure this week.

36:30.774 --> 36:31.974
Okay.

36:32.009 --> 36:33.576
There's stuff on it that says

36:33.610 --> 36:36.379
it's a Klingon, it's a Borg,

36:36.413 --> 36:39.482
not at all in the world
of Clive Barker.

36:39.516 --> 36:42.485
It's very problematic.

36:42.519 --> 36:44.387
Jamie, please step down.

36:49.660 --> 36:50.927
Ben.

36:56.266 --> 36:58.468
Would you please give us
a little backstory on her?

36:58.502 --> 36:59.836
She was a fetish model,

36:59.870 --> 37:01.270
always worried about her looks,

37:01.305 --> 37:04.874
and now she reaps the souls
of other people who are vain.

37:04.908 --> 37:08.478
She is really quite exquisite
when you get up close.

37:08.512 --> 37:11.514
I love how you use the
inspiration from her bodice here

37:11.548 --> 37:14.750
and put that in her cowl
as well as her neck.

37:14.785 --> 37:17.086
You brought the fashion
into the makeup,

37:17.121 --> 37:18.855
which is really a great idea.

37:18.889 --> 37:19.856
Thank you.

37:19.890 --> 37:20.990
I love the story.

37:21.024 --> 37:24.460
I love the corrupted
porcelain doll look.

37:24.495 --> 37:27.864
And I know Clive said
to go to the avant-garde,

37:27.898 --> 37:30.366
and you, perhaps more
than any other, have done that.

37:30.400 --> 37:31.534
Thank you.

37:31.568 --> 37:33.503
I absolutely love
the back of the head.

37:33.537 --> 37:35.204
It's so cool.

37:35.239 --> 37:37.440
And I appreciate
how smooth that is

37:37.474 --> 37:39.308
and the detail
that you put into it.

37:39.343 --> 37:41.878
I think it's a brilliant
and daring combination

37:41.912 --> 37:43.412
of all the different things

37:43.447 --> 37:45.848
in what is an extraordinarily
complex challenge.

37:45.883 --> 37:46.949
Thank you.

37:46.984 --> 37:48.718
Ben, please step back.

37:54.825 --> 37:56.025
All right, thank you, guys.

37:56.059 --> 37:57.293
If you'd please head
back to the makeup room

37:57.327 --> 37:58.961
while the judges deliberate.

38:06.069 --> 38:07.470
All right, judges,

38:07.504 --> 38:09.071
let's start with the looks
you liked the most tonight.

38:09.106 --> 38:10.473
How about Julian's work?

38:10.507 --> 38:11.974
He hit all the
right notes for me.

38:12.009 --> 38:13.943
It's the one
that is the most standout

38:13.977 --> 38:15.711
in the Clive Barker world.

38:15.746 --> 38:17.146
Up close, definitely one

38:17.181 --> 38:18.915
of the most terrifying
of the bunch.

38:18.949 --> 38:20.416
All right, let's move on
to Emily.

38:20.450 --> 38:21.984
The silhouette of that character

38:22.019 --> 38:23.486
is just unbelievable.

38:23.520 --> 38:24.487
It's freaky.

38:24.521 --> 38:26.322
I mean, she's amazing, this kid.

38:26.356 --> 38:28.391
It's an incredible makeup,

38:28.425 --> 38:30.826
but it's nowhere near
the Barker universe.

38:30.861 --> 38:32.728
All right,
let's move on to Kelly.

38:32.763 --> 38:34.530
Talk about a makeup that feels

38:34.565 --> 38:37.466
so perfectly suited
for this challenge.

38:37.501 --> 38:38.467
It was scary.

38:38.502 --> 38:39.869
It was sexy.

38:39.903 --> 38:42.004
The story behind it was maybe
my favorite of the night.

38:42.039 --> 38:43.239
I agree.

38:43.273 --> 38:45.441
All right, judges,
let's move on to Ben.

38:45.475 --> 38:48.878
I think that it is
the most astute treatment

38:48.912 --> 38:51.147
of bringing fashion
into the makeup.

38:51.181 --> 38:52.548
It's got pleasure and pain.

38:52.583 --> 38:54.317
It's got grace and grotesquerie.

38:54.351 --> 38:55.818
And that's all
that we can ask for.

38:55.852 --> 38:57.620
All right, judges,
let's move on to the looks

38:57.654 --> 38:59.255
that didn't quite work
for you this week.

38:59.289 --> 39:00.323
How about Stephanie?

39:00.357 --> 39:01.891
It is not avant-garde.

39:01.925 --> 39:03.759
It sure as hell
isn't Clive Barker.

39:03.794 --> 39:05.094
And it's not scary.

39:05.128 --> 39:06.929
I don't think she has any idea

39:06.964 --> 39:08.264
where she as going with it.

39:08.298 --> 39:10.967
I don't think it was executed
particularly well.

39:11.001 --> 39:12.535
All right,
let's move on to Jamie.

39:12.569 --> 39:14.370
The paint job was atrocious.

39:14.404 --> 39:15.805
It did not look like skin.

39:15.839 --> 39:18.107
And the black widow wasn't even
painted properly.

39:18.141 --> 39:20.376
It had nothing to do
with Clive's world at all,

39:20.410 --> 39:21.677
even on a technical level.

39:21.712 --> 39:24.013
The chin and the nose
look like melted wax.

39:24.047 --> 39:26.549
All right, judges,
have you made up your minds?

39:26.583 --> 39:27.717
Easy.

39:27.751 --> 39:29.485
Okay, let's bring them back out.

39:38.762 --> 39:41.264
All right, Glenn, tell us
about tonight's top looks.

39:41.298 --> 39:44.800
Julian, you gave us
a sophisticated

39:44.835 --> 39:46.502
and intelligent horror villain

39:46.536 --> 39:49.538
that definitely felt like it was
in the world of Clive Barker.

39:49.573 --> 39:54.443
And Kelly, your character
and concept told a great story,

39:54.478 --> 39:57.980
and you did a fantastic job
tapping into Barker imagery.

39:58.015 --> 40:01.917
And Ben, we were thrilled
by your high-concept thinking

40:01.952 --> 40:04.220
and loved the way that you
integrated your costume

40:04.254 --> 40:05.855
into the back of the head.

40:05.889 --> 40:08.291
So who is the winner
of this challenge?

40:08.325 --> 40:10.426
The winner of tonight's
challenge is...

40:17.642 --> 40:19.510
All right, who is the winner
of this challenge?

40:19.544 --> 40:21.312
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

40:24.916 --> 40:26.250
Ben.

40:28.520 --> 40:30.621
While some of the characters
may have better captured

40:30.655 --> 40:32.756
the classic
Clive Barker aesthetic,

40:32.791 --> 40:34.425
you gave us a glimpse
into the future.

40:34.459 --> 40:35.426
Great job.

40:35.460 --> 40:36.427
Thank you.

40:36.461 --> 40:37.561
Second win for me.

40:37.596 --> 40:39.530
It's extremely cool,

40:39.564 --> 40:41.565
especially since this
is a Clive Barker challenge.

40:41.600 --> 40:43.601
I'm sure that he's
gonna see this creature,

40:43.635 --> 40:45.269
which feels awesome.

40:45.303 --> 40:46.870
Ben, congratulations.

40:46.905 --> 40:49.873
You, Julian, Emily, and Kelly
are all safe

40:49.908 --> 40:52.376
and can head back to the makeup
room along with the coaches.

40:56.548 --> 40:57.915
All right,
that means the two of you

40:57.949 --> 40:59.416
are on the bottom this week,

40:59.451 --> 41:01.352
and one of you
will be going home.

41:01.386 --> 41:02.720
Please step forward.

41:09.394 --> 41:11.629
Glenn, tell us
about the bottom looks.

41:11.663 --> 41:14.098
Stephanie,
the prophet seer concept

41:14.132 --> 41:15.866
could have been
very interesting,

41:15.900 --> 41:18.836
but you let your indecision
compromise many of the aspects

41:18.870 --> 41:20.104
of your final makeup.

41:20.138 --> 41:23.040
And Jamie,
we get wanting to draw

41:23.074 --> 41:24.608
on the spider vibe
of the outfit,

41:24.643 --> 41:26.677
but that concept
was heavily undermined

41:26.711 --> 41:29.346
by all the technical issues
with your makeup.

41:29.381 --> 41:31.715
So who is going home
tonight, Glenn?

41:31.750 --> 41:33.784
The person going
home tonight is...

41:37.722 --> 41:38.756
Jamie.

41:40.291 --> 41:42.326
Despite all your best efforts,

41:42.360 --> 41:45.863
it seems like you just couldn't
pull all of your ideas together

41:45.897 --> 41:48.198
to deliver a clean makeup
this week.

41:48.233 --> 41:52.302
Jamie, I'm so sorry,
but you have been eliminated.

41:52.337 --> 41:54.705
Stephanie,
you are safe this week

41:54.739 --> 41:56.540
and can head back
to the makeup room.

42:01.379 --> 42:04.615
Jamie, I personally feel
that we're quite fortunate

42:04.649 --> 42:06.750
to have experienced your talents
on <i> Face Off.</i>

42:06.785 --> 42:09.119
And I know that this week
it got a little away from you,

42:09.154 --> 42:12.756
but I know that you've also got
a tremendous amount left in you.

42:12.791 --> 42:14.091
Thank you.

42:14.125 --> 42:16.660
Jamie, it's been so great
having you here with us,

42:16.695 --> 42:19.329
but if you'd please
head back to the makeup room

42:19.364 --> 42:20.497
and pack up your kit.

42:20.532 --> 42:21.799
Thank you, guys.

42:21.833 --> 42:22.833
- Good luck, Jamie.
- Good luck, Jamie.

42:22.867 --> 42:24.802
Thank you.

42:24.836 --> 42:26.603
I'm really surprised
that I'm going home.

42:26.638 --> 42:30.340
I feel that I have
a lot more to show.

42:33.645 --> 42:35.546
Jamie?

42:35.580 --> 42:39.183
I've met some amazing people,
and my coach is amazing.

42:39.217 --> 42:41.719
You've shown you can
do great makeups.

42:41.753 --> 42:43.787
You know, you've progressed
throughout the season.

42:43.822 --> 42:46.490
So continue growing
as an artist.

42:46.524 --> 42:50.227
I came out here to push myself
and break out of my shell.

42:52.130 --> 42:54.631
I'm upset, but at the same time,

42:54.666 --> 42:56.734
I'm excited to look ahead.
