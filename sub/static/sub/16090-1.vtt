01:04.920 --> 01:07.195
Look.
Where?

01:07.400 --> 01:08.833
There.

01:11.040 --> 01:13.031
Yes. I think so.

01:19.880 --> 01:20.835
Hello.

01:21.800 --> 01:24.075
Are you a new student?

01:24.280 --> 01:26.999
Yes.
Good. We thought so.

01:27.200 --> 01:28.474
We'd like to help you.

01:28.680 --> 01:31.478
Help me? Uh... What do you mean?

01:31.680 --> 01:34.513
As a freshman,
it can be very tough.

01:34.720 --> 01:38.030
You get to college and it's supposed
to be great, but it's not.

01:38.240 --> 01:39.912
University life can be pretty bad.

01:40.120 --> 01:41.712
There are a lot of suicides.

01:41.920 --> 01:43.353
Well, attempted ones.

01:43.560 --> 01:46.074
I'm not actually a freshman.
I'm a transfer student.

01:46.280 --> 01:49.431
Oh, an entering sophomore?
Yes.

01:49.640 --> 01:52.154
You were unappy
and are looking to recover here.

01:52.360 --> 01:54.555
Well, I think you will.
Yes.

01:55.560 --> 01:58.950
Would you welcome that? Would our
help be something you'd appreciate?

01:59.160 --> 02:01.720
Or would you rather sink or swim
on your own?

02:01.920 --> 02:05.799
Either way is fine. We'll be friends.
Yes, whichever you'd prefer.

02:06.240 --> 02:07.992
Yes. Sure.

02:08.199 --> 02:11.158
Great. Heh.
We should start immediately.

02:11.360 --> 02:15.831
Clothes can be crucial for confidence
and an overall sense of well-being.

02:16.040 --> 02:19.715
Clothes don't have to be expensive.
You need friends of the same size.

02:19.920 --> 02:23.037
You don't like my clothes?
I'm just saying. Move it out.

02:23.240 --> 02:24.958
What? What's wrong?

02:27.880 --> 02:31.031
What's wrong?
You didn't notice that?

02:31.240 --> 02:34.357
No. What?
Those guys.

02:34.560 --> 02:37.279
That smell. That awful, acrid odour.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.755
Have you heard
of nasal shock syndrome?

02:41.960 --> 02:46.192
Any harsh, acrid or just disgusting
odour sends Rose into nasal shock.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.992
Just from some BO?

02:49.360 --> 02:52.158
"Just some BO"?
Oh, my God, Lily.

02:52.360 --> 02:55.033
You must have
a very high threshold for pain.

02:55.240 --> 02:57.071
That'll serve you well
at Seven Oaks.

02:57.280 --> 02:59.999
What do you mean?
Seven Oaks is notorious for its BO.

03:00.200 --> 03:02.509
It was the last of the Select Seven
to go coed.

03:02.720 --> 03:05.109
An atmosphere
of male barbarism predominates,

03:05.320 --> 03:07.356
but we're going to change that.
Yes.

03:07.560 --> 03:09.278
Where are you going?

03:09.480 --> 03:13.109
Gotta get to the Housing Department.
They lost my rooming assignment.

03:13.320 --> 03:15.709
That's terrible.
You have no place to stay?

03:15.920 --> 03:16.955
Was it just mislaid?

03:17.160 --> 03:19.958
No, there were more acceptances
than they anticipated,

03:20.160 --> 03:23.470
and not enough rooms
to go around, so...

03:23.680 --> 03:25.113
Why don't you stay with us?

03:26.280 --> 03:27.349
Really?

03:32.480 --> 03:36.268
Don't think of this in the old-fashioned
sense of going to a party

03:36.480 --> 03:39.313
to find someone
or not find someone.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.875
That's not the dynamic
that we're talking about.

03:42.080 --> 03:44.674
What dynamic are you talking about?
Glad you asked.

03:44.880 --> 03:49.749
Our going to a party of this kind
is more a form of youth outreach.

03:49.960 --> 03:51.871
Of what?
Youth outreach.

03:52.080 --> 03:54.753
It's not just some moronic
frat-house social function.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.313
Though it will be that too.

03:56.520 --> 04:00.195
We've gotta keep in mind
that these guys are young people.

04:00.400 --> 04:04.837
They're essentially immature
and crying out for help and guidance.

04:05.040 --> 04:07.838
Though they don't know it.
No, they don't, but we do.

04:08.040 --> 04:11.999
Arert they the same age as we are?
Only numerically.

04:13.720 --> 04:16.632
I'm a lot fatter than you are,
but I think we could pin it.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.718
Oh, my gosh, that's beautiful.

04:20.320 --> 04:22.629
Ooh la la.
Stunning.

04:26.680 --> 04:28.477
Take Frank, my friend.

04:28.680 --> 04:32.036
He's not some cool, handsome,
studly macho type.

04:32.240 --> 04:35.550
No, not at all.
I can't stand guys like that.

04:35.760 --> 04:38.354
He's more of a sad sack really,
wouldn't you say?

04:38.560 --> 04:41.313
Definitely.
What is a sad sack?

04:41.520 --> 04:42.475
A loser.

04:42.680 --> 04:45.035
You like losers?
Very much so.

04:45.240 --> 04:47.879
Do you know what's the major problem
in social life?

04:48.080 --> 04:49.035
What?

04:49.240 --> 04:52.869
The tendency, widespread, to always
seek someone cooler than yourself.

04:53.080 --> 04:55.275
It's always a stretch.
Often a big stretch.

04:55.480 --> 04:57.391
Why not find someone
who's inferior?

04:57.600 --> 05:00.319
Someone like Frank.
Yes. It's more rewarding.

05:00.520 --> 05:03.114
And, in fact, quite reassuring.

05:03.320 --> 05:06.357
You mean someone you can help,
not just thinking of yourself.

05:06.560 --> 05:10.917
Yes, that's it, precisely. But without
the goody-goody implications.

05:11.120 --> 05:13.076
Our aspirations are pretty basic.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.874
Take a guy who hasn't realised
his full potential

05:16.080 --> 05:17.593
or doesn't even have much,

05:17.800 --> 05:21.554
and then help him realise it
or find more.

05:24.760 --> 05:28.639
There's enough material here
for a lifetime of social work.

05:31.800 --> 05:36.715
What's really worrisome
is that that was intentional.

05:43.120 --> 05:44.155
Frank.

05:44.480 --> 05:45.708
Mm.

05:45.920 --> 05:51.631
Frank, this is Lily. She's just come to Seven
Oaks as a transfer student. Isn't she great?

05:51.840 --> 05:54.115
Lily failed
or wasrt happy at her last school.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.356
We're sure that she's going
to adapt here.

05:56.560 --> 05:58.198
In fact, she already has.
Oh, good.

05:58.400 --> 05:59.594
<i># Another night
Another dream #</i>

05:59.800 --> 06:02.075
Oh, my God. A golden oldie.

06:02.600 --> 06:04.636
I love these.

06:04.840 --> 06:08.628
<i># Another night
Another dream but always you #</i>

06:08.840 --> 06:13.118
<i># In the night I dream of love
So true #</i>

06:27.560 --> 06:30.358
<i># Just another night
Another vision of love #</i>

06:30.560 --> 06:34.712
<i># You feel joy, you feel pain
'Cause nothing will be the same #</i>

06:34.920 --> 06:37.832
<i># Just another night
Is all that it tak es #</i>

06:38.040 --> 06:41.794
<i># To understand the difference
Between lovers and fak es #</i>

06:42.000 --> 06:44.878
<i># So baby, I talk, talk
I talk to you #</i>

06:45.080 --> 06:49.596
<i># In the night in your dream
Of love so true #</i>

06:49.800 --> 06:51.472
<i># I talk, talk
I talk to you #</i>

06:51.680 --> 06:55.150
Oh, my gosh. Wasrt that great?
That was really fun.

06:55.360 --> 06:58.557
I know that people can have
useful careers in many areas.

06:58.760 --> 07:01.433
Medicine, government, law, finance.

07:01.640 --> 07:03.358
Education.
Yes, even education.

07:03.560 --> 07:06.916
But I'd like to do something
especially significant in my lifetime.

07:07.120 --> 07:09.395
That could change the course
of human history.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.989
Such as starting a new dance craze.
Really?

07:12.200 --> 07:14.430
Yes. Something that could
improve the lives

07:14.640 --> 07:16.471
of every person and every couple.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.995
<i># That seems to be true
Another night ##</i>

07:20.880 --> 07:23.713
I'm so proud of what you
accomplished last night.

07:23.920 --> 07:26.115
You showed those guys
a really good time.

07:26.320 --> 07:29.596
Without anything really bad
happening. That's good.

07:29.800 --> 07:32.314
The guys you know,
are they all Greeks?

07:32.520 --> 07:35.159
What?
Are all the guys you know Greeks?

07:35.360 --> 07:37.032
Excuse me. I don't understand.

07:37.240 --> 07:42.553
Are all the guys you know Greeks?

07:43.560 --> 07:46.996
I don't think we know any Greeks.
Greeks, like frat boys.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.349
Oh, yes. Fraternities.

07:48.560 --> 07:51.028
You mean members
of the Greek-letter fraternities.

07:51.240 --> 07:52.639
Yeah. Like last night.

07:52.840 --> 07:55.957
Actually, last night
we were at the DU house. DU.

07:56.160 --> 07:57.513
Roman letters. Not Greek.

07:57.720 --> 08:00.598
Seven Oaks has never had
a Greek-letter fraternity system.

08:00.800 --> 08:03.189
It's always been
a Roman-letter system here.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.436
It's very different.

08:08.400 --> 08:11.870
What house is this?
Oh, this isn't a fraternity.

08:12.080 --> 08:14.594
At least not one anyone
should want to join.

08:14.800 --> 08:18.713
You probably think we're frivolous,
empty-headed college coeds.

08:18.920 --> 08:21.309
You're probably right.
I often feel empty-headed.

08:21.520 --> 08:24.080
We're trying to make a difference
in people's lives.

08:24.280 --> 08:27.238
One way to do that is to stop them
from killing themselves.

08:28.880 --> 08:31.838
Have you ever heard of
"Prevention is nine-tenths the cure"?

08:32.039 --> 08:35.191
Well, in the case of suicide,
it's actually 10-tenths the cure.

08:35.400 --> 08:38.631
Those are clichés, aren't they?
Yes, they are.

08:39.240 --> 08:42.835
It's interesting you say that. I love
clichés and hackneyed expressions.

08:43.039 --> 08:44.553
Do you know why?
No.

08:44.760 --> 08:46.239
Because they're largely true.

08:46.440 --> 08:48.476
The hundreds,
perhaps thousands,

08:48.680 --> 08:50.955
of such clichés
and hackneyed expressions

08:51.160 --> 08:53.196
that our language
has bequeathed us

08:53.400 --> 08:56.756
are a stunning treasure trove
of human insight and knowledge.

08:56.960 --> 08:59.520
Really?
Yes. Oh, please sit down.

08:59.960 --> 09:01.837
During these formative
college years,

09:02.040 --> 09:05.510
we should learn as many clichéd
and hackneyed thoughts as possible.

09:05.720 --> 09:07.153
Furthermore, I think we will.

09:07.360 --> 09:11.148
Speaking of suicide prevention,
do you have a boyfriend, Lily?

09:11.360 --> 09:13.999
Are you dating anyone?
I don't see the connection.

09:14.200 --> 09:17.317
You don't?
Boyfriends are a primary suicide risk.

09:17.520 --> 09:20.159
You don't have
any particular friend?

09:20.360 --> 09:22.157
No one at all?

09:22.360 --> 09:26.114
No. Well, there's this grad student
I met over summer.

09:26.320 --> 09:30.438
Xavier.
We became pretty good pals.

09:30.640 --> 09:34.155
He has a girlfriend whom I've met.
She's very nice.

09:34.360 --> 09:35.839
"Zavier. " With a Z?

09:36.040 --> 09:38.634
No, I think it's with an X.
No, I'm certain it's Z.

09:38.840 --> 09:43.755
Zavier, like Zorro. It's the same
sound. Zorro marked his name with a Z.

09:45.760 --> 09:47.398
It's an X.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.397
But Zorro's with a Z.

09:49.600 --> 09:51.636
Okay, let me see
if I can figure this out.

09:51.840 --> 09:57.517
Used at the beginning of a name,
Z and X have the same pronunciation.

09:57.720 --> 10:01.315
But it's Zorro with a Z.
Actually, there were two Zorros.

10:01.520 --> 10:05.433
One spelled his name with a Z
and made a Z mark for Zorro.

10:05.640 --> 10:08.438
And there's Xorro
who spelled his name with an X,

10:08.640 --> 10:10.835
and with his sword
he'd make an X mark.

10:11.040 --> 10:14.271
What was really unfair was
because he marked his name with X,

10:14.480 --> 10:16.471
everybody assumed
he was illiterate

10:17.120 --> 10:18.792
when he was spelling correctly.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.149
Hello.
Can we help you?

10:20.360 --> 10:22.715
Of course we can.
No case is too challenging.

10:22.920 --> 10:24.558
Would you like a doughnut?
Okay.

10:24.760 --> 10:25.715
Please, sit down.

10:25.920 --> 10:27.831
Here, have some coffee.
Thank you.

10:28.040 --> 10:29.393
What's your name?
Jim Bose.

10:29.600 --> 10:31.989
But my friends call me Jimbo.
Why?

10:32.400 --> 10:34.675
What?
Why do your friends call you Jimbo?

10:34.880 --> 10:38.998
Well, it's a contraction of Jim and
the first part of my last name, Bose.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.111
Yeah, I got that. But why bother?

10:41.320 --> 10:44.153
What do you mean?
Jim is already a lovely name.

10:44.360 --> 10:46.237
It's short, simple, evocative.

10:46.440 --> 10:49.193
Shouldrt a nickname
simplify the name that it replaces?

10:49.400 --> 10:51.356
Jimbo doesn't really
simplify anything.

10:51.560 --> 10:52.754
I don't know.

10:52.960 --> 10:55.155
Well, maybe you should ask
your friends.

10:55.920 --> 10:57.433
Where do you live or reside?

10:57.640 --> 10:59.517
Doar Dorm.
Ugh.

10:59.720 --> 11:00.994
Oh, my God. Yuck.
What?

11:01.720 --> 11:04.029
The smell, it's notorious.
What smell?

11:04.760 --> 11:08.878
You're right, it's more like a stink.
Unclean clothing, I'd say, mostly.

11:09.080 --> 11:10.559
Vomit.
Stale beer.

11:10.760 --> 11:13.638
Pot. Cheap deodorant.
There might be a vermin infestation.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.956
Did you know
a good-smelling environment

11:16.160 --> 11:18.151
is crucial to our sense
of well-being?

11:18.360 --> 11:20.794
Have you tried to find
a better-smelling place?

11:21.000 --> 11:23.753
Wait, wait.
It's not me, I'm not depressed.

11:25.080 --> 11:26.274
You're not?
No.

11:27.880 --> 11:29.916
Are you sure?
You kind of seem on edge.

11:30.120 --> 11:33.749
No, I'm fine.
That's a terrible expression. "Fine. "

11:33.960 --> 11:39.478
"I'm fine. " Something smug
about it. "I'm fine. "

11:39.680 --> 11:43.309
Why do you say that you're fine?
I'm not depressed. I'm not suicidal.

11:45.840 --> 11:47.990
Why are you here, then?
Are you a con man?

11:48.200 --> 11:50.475
A confidence trickster?
No, there's a girl.

11:50.680 --> 11:53.592
Her boyfriend dumped her.
She was crying but now is silent.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.552
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you say so?

11:57.200 --> 12:00.351
We have to go. Call the cops!
A suicide might be in progress!

12:00.560 --> 12:03.358
The campus cops?
Yes, of course the campus cops.

12:03.600 --> 12:04.715
Take this.

12:04.920 --> 12:07.639
We have a lot of students
coming to the centre

12:07.840 --> 12:10.115
pretending to be depressed
to get doughnuts.

12:10.320 --> 12:13.596
Confidence tricksters.
Yes, it's really bad. Really cynical.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.597
We pledged
to the doughnut company,

12:15.800 --> 12:19.190
we would only give doughnuts
to students who were depressed

12:19.400 --> 12:20.674
or otherwise nutty.

12:20.880 --> 12:23.997
We're a nonprofit,
so the rules are pretty strict.

12:24.200 --> 12:27.829
This man could still be a trickster.
Well, we'll soon find out.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.234
Tell me about this girl.

12:29.440 --> 12:31.795
Well, ahem, her name is Priss.
She's very pretty.

12:32.000 --> 12:37.279
Oh, yes. It's very hard for beautiful
women to experience rejection.

12:39.480 --> 12:43.109
Priss? Priss. Are you okay?

12:43.320 --> 12:46.869
Priss! Priss, say something!

12:48.120 --> 12:50.714
Priss! Open up!

12:52.560 --> 12:56.519
Oh, thank God.
We're gonna have to force this door.

12:57.560 --> 12:59.516
Priss? Are you okay?

13:02.160 --> 13:05.869
What?
Please don't. Please, come with us.

13:15.480 --> 13:17.835
Do you wanna talk about it?

13:18.040 --> 13:20.076
What was his name?

13:20.280 --> 13:21.838
Josh.

13:23.240 --> 13:25.310
If you'd rather not talk,
we don't have to.

13:25.520 --> 13:27.670
No, it's okay, I just...

13:27.880 --> 13:32.829
I keep thinking how he used to gaze
at me with such love in his eyes.

13:33.040 --> 13:34.712
You know what I mean?

13:38.840 --> 13:41.274
No. No, I've never
actually seen that.

13:42.040 --> 13:45.828
Yes. Just days ago,
he'd gaze at me.

13:46.040 --> 13:48.838
His eyes, so blue.

13:49.640 --> 13:51.517
He had blue eyes?

13:51.720 --> 13:54.154
So does Frank.
Frank's the guy that I go out with.

13:54.360 --> 13:58.592
Otherwise, he's not conventionally
good-looking, which I actually prefer.

13:59.640 --> 14:03.110
Would you describe Josh
as handsome?

14:03.800 --> 14:06.872
That's a problem.
Could I join you guys?

14:07.720 --> 14:12.157
Yes, please.
Priss and I were just talking.

14:12.360 --> 14:15.511
In my view,
handsome men are to be avoided.

14:15.720 --> 14:18.598
I don't even consider good looks
to be flattering in a man.

14:18.800 --> 14:21.439
Do you know what I mean?
No.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.278
Cookie-cutter, good-looking guys,
with their chiselled features,

14:28.480 --> 14:30.391
running around,
full of themselves,

14:30.600 --> 14:33.910
getting everything they want,
never suffering or experiencing...

14:34.120 --> 14:35.553
We suffered?

14:36.560 --> 14:40.792
We're not under discussion. That's
irrelevant. That's besides the point.

14:42.280 --> 14:46.512
Is this making you feel any better?
Yes. I think so.

14:47.080 --> 14:48.354
Good. I hoped it would.

14:52.120 --> 14:56.079
<i>Okay, it's nearly 4 and The Daily
Complainer's orientation meeting</i>

14:56.280 --> 14:58.714
is about to start
and I think we should go.

14:58.920 --> 15:01.798
The editor, Rick DeWolfe,
he's terrible. A real jerk.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.991
Why do you think
he's such a jerk?

15:04.600 --> 15:07.034
He's one of those
that I was talking about. Tall.

15:07.240 --> 15:10.391
Probably considers himself
very smart and handsome.

15:10.600 --> 15:14.639
A journalist, so you can imagine the
mindboggling arrogance and conceit.

15:14.840 --> 15:19.277
But, Violet, don't you think...?
What?

15:19.480 --> 15:23.678
Well, don't you think that the way you
talk could be considered arrogant too?

15:23.880 --> 15:25.438
I mean, a little?

15:25.640 --> 15:28.552
Yes, of course.
But what's your point?

15:28.760 --> 15:31.194
Wouldrt that be hypocritical,
criticising Rick

15:31.400 --> 15:34.073
for something
you could be criticised for yourself?

15:34.280 --> 15:37.875
No. I don't see why.
We're all flawed.

15:38.080 --> 15:40.878
Must that render us mute
to the flaws of others?

15:41.080 --> 15:43.071
Must we tether ourselves
from comment

15:43.280 --> 15:46.113
because our natures
are human too?

15:47.720 --> 15:49.676
We've got a rebel amongst us.

15:49.880 --> 15:53.031
That's good, I think. It's good
to be challenged and criticised.

15:53.240 --> 15:55.515
I know your intentions are good,
it's just...

15:55.720 --> 15:58.837
That's it precisely.
Our intentions are good.

15:59.040 --> 16:01.918
We're seeking to help people
rescue their lives

16:02.120 --> 16:04.714
from terrible sadness and failure,

16:04.920 --> 16:07.036
which is a won'thy goal,
don't you think?

16:07.240 --> 16:10.471
Yes. But not exactly a humble one.

16:10.800 --> 16:12.392
No.

16:12.600 --> 16:15.512
I agree with you there.
You're right, absolutely.

16:15.720 --> 16:18.234
I'd like to thank you
for this chastisement.

16:18.440 --> 16:21.512
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to chastise.
No, I think you did,

16:21.720 --> 16:23.039
and I think it's good.

16:23.240 --> 16:24.639
It's good to have a friend

16:24.840 --> 16:27.638
to put one in one's place
when that's what one needs.

16:27.840 --> 16:30.434
Now I see that I have
that kind of friend in you.

16:30.640 --> 16:32.517
I think that's great.

16:37.560 --> 16:39.755
Hello, people. Listen up.

16:41.720 --> 16:46.555
People, quiet. Quiet, people.
Shut up! Ha-ha-ha.

16:46.760 --> 16:50.070
<i>Okay, that's better. I'm Rick DeWolfe,
editor of The Complainer.</i>

16:50.280 --> 16:54.068
Over the next weeks, I'm the person
you're gonna hate most in the world.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.999
You're gonna hate me because
I'm gonna work you,

16:57.200 --> 16:59.919
point out your stupidity
and incompetence,

17:00.120 --> 17:04.079
and do everything in my power
to turn you into journalists.

17:04.280 --> 17:07.157
Albeit barely literate ones.
Oh, brother.

17:10.359 --> 17:12.316
Any questions?

17:12.520 --> 17:13.474
No?

17:13.680 --> 17:16.273
<i>Yes. How did The Daily Complainer
get its name?</i>

17:17.079 --> 17:20.310
Hmm. Isn't that pretty obvious?
Heh-heh.

17:21.160 --> 17:25.597
Um, it comes out every day
and it's the university daily.

17:25.800 --> 17:29.429
<i>So The Daily Complainer.</i>

17:29.640 --> 17:31.312
<i>The Daily...
No, I meant...</i>

17:31.520 --> 17:33.590
<i>Oh, you mean,
why The Complainer?</i>

17:33.800 --> 17:37.110
The name dates from Seven Oaks'
earliest days as a divinity school.

17:37.320 --> 17:40.790
The reference is to the Book of Job.
Job's complaint with the world.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.310
Before justice can be achieved,
a complaint must be made.

17:44.520 --> 17:47.080
That is what we do
and people don't like it a bit.

17:47.280 --> 17:48.713
Right now, what that means

17:48.920 --> 17:52.435
is extirpating Seven Oaks'
elitist Roman Letter Clubs

17:52.640 --> 17:55.029
that are like a cancer
on the community.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.151
They're not elitist in the least.

17:57.880 --> 17:59.199
Yes, they are.

17:59.400 --> 18:02.915
Have you met any of their members?
The guys from the DU, for example?

18:03.120 --> 18:05.918
They're barely competent
for the tasks of everyday life.

18:06.120 --> 18:09.237
They have to drink a quart of beer
just to talk to a woman?

18:09.440 --> 18:11.749
Two quarts.
Yet you salivate at the idea

18:11.960 --> 18:15.509
of taking the roof off their heads
and throwing them on the street

18:15.720 --> 18:19.156
where who knows what would
happen. You call yourself a Christian.

18:19.360 --> 18:22.511
No, I don't.
What unkindness and cruelty.

18:22.720 --> 18:26.395
This is the darkness in the heart
of man, which Joseph Conrad

18:26.600 --> 18:28.113
wrote about most eloquently.

18:28.320 --> 18:31.073
Ooh. He was actually Polish.
Oh, my God.

18:31.280 --> 18:34.272
Unkind, self-righteous
and pedantic.

18:34.480 --> 18:37.074
In short, a model journalist.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.396
You should know something
about these girls.

18:39.600 --> 18:43.354
They run the suicide centre where
their preferred therapy for depressed

18:43.560 --> 18:46.199
and suicidal people is

18:46.840 --> 18:47.795
tap dancing.

18:50.280 --> 18:54.876
I kid you not.
Tap is a highly effective therapy,

18:55.080 --> 18:57.594
as well as a dazzlingly
expressive dance form

18:57.800 --> 19:00.598
that has been sadly neglected
for too many years.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.995
It's moronic and barbaric.

19:03.200 --> 19:05.760
You expect tap dancing
to solve people's problems?

19:05.960 --> 19:07.518
No, we don't.

19:07.720 --> 19:10.553
We're using the whole range
of musical dance numbers

19:10.760 --> 19:13.797
which have proven themselves
to be effective therapies

19:14.000 --> 19:16.639
for the suicidal
and the hopelessly depressed.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.676
That really got me down.

19:23.880 --> 19:28.635
I thought you handled it well.
You did? Thanks.

19:29.320 --> 19:32.790
No, it's all this aggression
and hostility that gets me down.

19:33.000 --> 19:37.710
Not just his but also my own.
It leaves you feeling unclean.

19:37.920 --> 19:40.992
Have you thought of taking a shower?
Maybe you'd feel better.

19:41.200 --> 19:44.351
You're probably right.
No, there's something else.

19:44.560 --> 19:47.870
What Lily was saying about me
being conceited and arrogant.

19:48.080 --> 19:51.197
I'm sorry.
No, I think you're right.

19:51.400 --> 19:52.958
I'm really ashamed.

19:53.920 --> 19:56.639
You're joking.
No, it's terrible how I've acted.

19:56.840 --> 19:58.398
We're all Christians.

19:58.600 --> 20:02.559
Or I should say Judeo-Christians.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.278
Humility should be our watchword.
The essence of being a good person.

20:07.480 --> 20:09.550
Humility comes from within.

20:09.760 --> 20:12.911
If it's not there in the first place,
where do you go to get it?

20:13.120 --> 20:15.475
I stopped looking a long time ago.

20:25.480 --> 20:27.516
Very good, Freak.

20:27.720 --> 20:30.598
You really think so?
Yes. Certainly.

20:33.720 --> 20:36.314
Five, six, seven, eight.
Violet.

20:37.880 --> 20:39.871
Is it such a good idea
to call him Freak?

20:40.080 --> 20:41.593
What?

20:41.800 --> 20:44.314
He's already depressed
and you're calling him Freak.

20:44.520 --> 20:48.195
That's his name. Freak. Freak Astaire.
That's how he wants to be called.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.277
What are you talking about?

20:50.480 --> 20:52.789
Lily was just saying
she likes your dancing.

20:56.600 --> 20:58.397
Five, six, seven, eight.

21:05.920 --> 21:07.239
Are you okay?

21:07.440 --> 21:08.953
What do you mean?

21:09.160 --> 21:11.355
I thought you looked sad
and was wondering

21:11.560 --> 21:14.597
if there was anything we could do.
What could you do?

21:14.800 --> 21:15.755
Oh, I know.

21:15.960 --> 21:18.918
You think I'm gonna kill myself
and make you look bad.

21:19.120 --> 21:22.908
No, I'm worried that you'll kill yourself
and make yourself look bad.

21:23.120 --> 21:26.271
Do you have any idea
how demoralising it is

21:26.480 --> 21:30.029
to be constantly questioned
about whether you're suicidal or not?

21:30.240 --> 21:31.195
No.

21:31.400 --> 21:34.358
After a while, you wonder,
why is everyone asking me this?

21:34.560 --> 21:35.913
They want me to be suicidal?

21:36.120 --> 21:38.839
Or is it just the consequence
of your utter absurdity?

21:39.040 --> 21:40.189
Excuse me.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.038
What scent are you wearing?

21:42.240 --> 21:45.073
What are you talking about?
The perfume you're wearing.

21:45.280 --> 21:47.475
I'm not wearing any perfume!

21:48.280 --> 21:51.113
You see, that could be the problem.

21:53.120 --> 21:54.792
<i>I've become friends with a group.</i>

21:55.000 --> 21:56.433
<i>Really?</i>

21:56.640 --> 21:59.518
Although they're perfume-obsessed.
Oh, them? Those girls?

22:00.280 --> 22:02.077
The ones who volunteer
at the centre?

22:02.280 --> 22:03.633
Yeah.
But they're terrible.

22:03.840 --> 22:05.637
The blond one? She's notorious.

22:05.840 --> 22:08.479
What do you mean?
Such a bitch. Terrible, isn't she?

22:08.680 --> 22:10.716
Would balsamic be okay?
What?

22:11.480 --> 22:13.596
Balsamic vinegar. For the dressing.

22:13.800 --> 22:16.792
Oh. Yeah, sure.

22:21.080 --> 22:22.718
What's that?
What?

22:22.920 --> 22:25.309
Those.
Artichokes?

22:25.520 --> 22:27.511
Is that what they look like?

22:27.720 --> 22:30.473
Come on, Lily.
You've seen an artichoke before.

22:31.320 --> 22:33.914
You haven't?
They look so weird.

22:39.840 --> 22:43.071
I'm not convinced that having
a suicide-prevention centre

22:43.280 --> 22:45.510
prevents any suicides.

22:45.720 --> 22:47.517
Well, the coffee's good.

22:47.720 --> 22:50.473
If someone were determined
to destroy themselves,

22:50.680 --> 22:54.514
I don't think they'd stop for coffee.
It depends on what it tastes like.

22:54.720 --> 22:57.871
Where are we going?
I thought I'd take Priss over to DU.

22:58.080 --> 22:59.035
Why?

22:59.240 --> 23:01.834
It might be helpful
for her to meet some of the guys.

23:02.040 --> 23:04.076
How would that be helpful?
They're morons.

23:04.280 --> 23:06.236
Oh, come on, Lily.
No, they're morons.

23:06.440 --> 23:09.671
No. Not medically. I like them.

23:09.880 --> 23:12.952
They're in that sympathetic range
of being not good-looking

23:13.160 --> 23:16.357
and yet not smart.
There's something likeable about that.

23:16.560 --> 23:20.473
Spending time with them, you get the
sense that you're making a difference.

23:20.680 --> 23:23.717
For somebody suicidal, like Priss,
that could be a real boost.

23:23.920 --> 23:26.593
I'm not suicidal.
Oh, that's good.

23:26.800 --> 23:31.999
It's better not to have an identity
as a suicidal person, don't you think?

23:33.000 --> 23:35.992
Well, uh, bye.
Well...

23:36.680 --> 23:39.035
Where are you going?
Over to Xavier's.

23:39.800 --> 23:42.234
Is that a good idea?
Why wouldn't it be?

23:42.440 --> 23:45.716
Is his girlfriend gonna be there?
Of course.

23:45.920 --> 23:49.708
Gosh, you're nosy.
No, no, it's just a general foreboding.

23:49.920 --> 23:51.797
"Foreboding"?

23:53.720 --> 23:57.599
You know, you're absolutely right.
I was being nosy.

23:57.800 --> 23:59.870
Terribly so.

24:00.280 --> 24:03.397
I've gotta watch that.
Yes, we must improve ourselves.

24:04.440 --> 24:05.839
Bye.
Bye.

24:06.040 --> 24:06.995
Bye.
Bye.

24:07.200 --> 24:08.315
Bye.

24:15.960 --> 24:17.518
Lily.

24:18.040 --> 24:21.669
You were coming over?
Hey. Yeah. Is Alice home?

24:21.880 --> 24:23.552
Alice is working.

24:23.760 --> 24:25.557
Oh, she is?
But it's not a problem.

24:25.760 --> 24:26.715
It's good you came.

24:26.920 --> 24:29.434
Let's go to the Oak Bar.
I'll buy you a beer.

24:29.640 --> 24:33.110
I thought Alice would be back.
I'll call her. She'll join us there.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.598
Come on.

24:35.800 --> 24:36.755
Okay.

24:36.960 --> 24:38.712
She's actually quite a good person.

24:38.920 --> 24:41.753
Her entire identity
revolves around helping people.

24:41.960 --> 24:43.791
You really think that's true?

24:44.000 --> 24:47.037
<i>What's she have against
The Complainer? That's bizarre.</i>

24:47.240 --> 24:50.869
Well, she thinks the editor, Rick
DeWolfe, is completely egotistical.

24:51.080 --> 24:52.479
And your friend isn't?

24:52.680 --> 24:53.908
Hi.
Hi.

24:54.120 --> 24:55.075
Hi, Lily.
Hi.

24:55.280 --> 24:57.157
Great. You got the message.
Yeah.

24:58.920 --> 25:00.797
Who's egotistical?
Lily's roommate.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.356
<i>She sounds unbearable. She's on
a rampage against The Complainer.</i>

25:04.560 --> 25:05.549
Really? Why?

25:05.760 --> 25:09.275
She thinks the editor,
Rick DeWolfe, is conceited.

25:09.480 --> 25:11.994
And, in fact, quite mean.
Mean?

25:12.200 --> 25:15.033
Yes. He wants to close
the Seven Oaks Roman Letter Clubs.

25:15.240 --> 25:17.800
That's good, isn't it?
Everyone was against them.

25:18.000 --> 25:19.638
No.
Come on.

25:19.840 --> 25:22.115
There's no justification
for those places.

25:22.320 --> 25:24.117
They're exclusive and elitist.

25:24.320 --> 25:27.790
The point that Violet makes
is that they can't be elitist.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.878
They're morons.
Yeah, elitist morons.

25:31.080 --> 25:33.389
You'll grant they're morons.
That's a handicap.

25:33.600 --> 25:37.878
Such people should be helped,
not hounded and persecuted.

25:38.080 --> 25:41.072
Persecuted?
Yes, losing the roof over your head?

25:41.280 --> 25:43.396
That's the worst thing
that can happen.

25:43.600 --> 25:46.194
Violet thinks there could be
some risk of suicide.

25:46.400 --> 25:50.234
Because some boy might kill himself,
Seven Oaks can't do what's right?

25:50.440 --> 25:52.396
It's a factor to be considered.

25:52.600 --> 25:54.955
Yeah.
No, it isn't.

25:55.160 --> 25:56.673
You can't set policy that way.

25:57.400 --> 26:02.155
Excuse me, we didn't order these.
Compliments of the guy at the bar.

26:06.680 --> 26:11.276
That's a playboy or operator move.
Operators like that are to be avoided.

26:11.480 --> 26:15.678
Why? It seems generous, sending
drinks to people you don't know.

26:15.880 --> 26:18.599
Drinks are expensive.
Drinks to two gorgeous girls.

26:18.800 --> 26:21.758
His intention was to seduce
and he assumed he could.

26:21.960 --> 26:23.916
Both?
That seems a bit harsh.

26:24.120 --> 26:26.953
You don't know what he was thinking.
Was he alone?

26:27.160 --> 26:28.479
Yes.

26:28.680 --> 26:31.672
You see?
He was alone and probably lonely.

26:31.880 --> 26:34.314
He could see that Alice and Lily
were students.

26:34.520 --> 26:37.159
Students are known
for their intelligent conversation.

26:37.360 --> 26:39.476
They can always talk
about their courses.

26:39.680 --> 26:41.511
That was probably
what attracted him.

26:41.720 --> 26:42.709
Nonsense.

26:42.920 --> 26:44.592
Perhaps his view was even loftier.

26:44.800 --> 26:47.155
To court Lily
with a view to matrimony.

26:47.360 --> 26:49.749
We're in the north,
but a southern gentleman

26:49.960 --> 26:51.632
can wander into these parts.

26:51.840 --> 26:52.795
Rubbish.

26:53.000 --> 26:57.437
Seeing Lily across a crowded bar filled
with the usual undergraduate slobs.

26:57.640 --> 27:00.200
Why wouldn't a thoughtful
young man seek her out?

27:00.400 --> 27:01.435
She's lovely.

27:01.640 --> 27:05.599
Isn't it incumbent on men and women
to find ways to meet each other?

27:05.800 --> 27:09.759
Buying drinks for a person you don't
know seems to be a generous one.

27:09.960 --> 27:12.997
Yes. Most guys won't even pay
for the women they do know.

27:13.200 --> 27:16.033
What you've described is
a playboy or operator move.

27:16.240 --> 27:19.152
I'll grant you that it's a tactic
or perhaps even a ruse,

27:19.360 --> 27:22.352
but without some of that,
would our species even survive?

27:22.560 --> 27:24.755
The Lord said,
"Be fruitful and multiply. "

27:24.960 --> 27:25.915
Oh, my gosh.

27:26.520 --> 27:30.149
No, this is how the world works,
seeing someone across a room.

27:30.360 --> 27:33.397
This could be the romantic story
you tell your grandchildren.

27:33.600 --> 27:36.194
And if you do marry
and have children,

27:36.400 --> 27:38.755
then he'll really learn
how to squander cash.

27:38.960 --> 27:42.714
Isn't it good to know that
he's basically generous from the start?

27:45.400 --> 27:47.118
Where's Priss?

27:48.600 --> 27:51.990
Your eyes are so striking. So blue.

27:52.200 --> 27:54.555
Really? They're blue?
Yes.

27:55.480 --> 27:56.913
The most piercing blue.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.718
You must know your eyes are blue.

27:59.920 --> 28:03.037
No.
What do you mean?

28:03.240 --> 28:04.195
What? Heh.

28:04.400 --> 28:06.709
You must know
what colour your eyes are.

28:06.920 --> 28:08.797
Your eyes are very blue.
You know that.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.470
I'm not gonna go around checking
what colour my eyes are.

28:12.680 --> 28:15.672
When you look in the mirror,
you see that your eyes are blue.

28:15.880 --> 28:18.394
Oh, come on.
What?

28:18.600 --> 28:20.352
I don't think my eyes have a colour.

28:20.560 --> 28:25.111
If my eyes are so blue looking out,
wouldn't everything be kind of blue?

28:25.320 --> 28:27.515
Like, have a bluish tinge to it?

28:32.280 --> 28:35.033
Doesrt. Just looks normal.

28:37.560 --> 28:40.518
That's...? That's blue?

28:40.720 --> 28:43.188
That colour?
Yes, of course.

28:43.400 --> 28:44.879
Then what colour is that?

28:45.080 --> 28:46.399
Green.

28:46.600 --> 28:49.433
You're saying that chair's green
but Frank's eyes are blue?

28:49.640 --> 28:50.868
Yes.

28:51.080 --> 28:52.593
Then what colour are the walls?

28:52.800 --> 28:54.392
Also green.

28:55.240 --> 28:56.468
Huh.

28:56.920 --> 28:58.194
You didn't know that?

29:00.040 --> 29:01.109
No.

29:01.320 --> 29:02.753
How's that possible?

29:02.960 --> 29:06.396
You think knowing the colours
is so important?

29:06.600 --> 29:08.955
You're in college
and you don't know the colours?

29:09.160 --> 29:11.196
Doesrt that embarrass you?

29:11.400 --> 29:13.960
Well, no. Why should it?

29:14.160 --> 29:17.118
That's why the 'rents are paying
big bucks to send me here.

29:17.320 --> 29:19.675
You know, to learn stuff.

29:20.600 --> 29:22.750
Well, gotta go hit the books.

29:27.440 --> 29:31.513
I don't think anyone should feel
embarrassed about not knowing stuff.

29:31.720 --> 29:34.393
What's embarrassing
is pretending to know.

29:34.600 --> 29:37.876
Or putting people down because
you think they don't know as much.

29:38.080 --> 29:40.514
Look, I'm happy to admit
I'm completely ignorant.

29:40.720 --> 29:43.678
That's why I'm here
and plan to really hit the books.

29:43.880 --> 29:46.838
So the next time you see me,
I will know more than I do now.

29:47.040 --> 29:49.270
I'll be older but also wiser.

29:49.480 --> 29:51.471
Or at least know more stuff.

29:51.680 --> 29:54.353
For me, that's education.

29:56.000 --> 29:56.955
Cheers.

29:59.640 --> 30:02.871
Thor's great.
He's very clear about his objectives.

30:03.080 --> 30:04.638
He really wants to learn things.

30:18.240 --> 30:19.468
Frank?

30:25.320 --> 30:26.275
What a jerk.

30:26.480 --> 30:28.436
He's a monster.
Oh, my gosh, Violet.

30:28.640 --> 30:31.393
You did everything for them.
They're nothing without you.

30:31.600 --> 30:33.556
What a rat.
He's a moron.

30:33.760 --> 30:35.318
Don't waste a tear on that creep.

30:35.520 --> 30:36.919
Don't waste a single breath.

30:37.120 --> 30:38.269
Jerk.
Stop.

30:38.480 --> 30:40.152
Please.
What?

30:40.840 --> 30:43.035
I love Frank.

30:44.440 --> 30:46.317
I love him.

30:50.680 --> 30:53.752
Come on, Violet, Frank's a moron.
You are well rid of him.

30:53.960 --> 30:56.190
Don't say that.
Frank's not a moron?

30:56.680 --> 30:59.831
You know, Lily, you're a bit harsh.

31:00.520 --> 31:02.112
This obsession with intelligence.

31:02.320 --> 31:05.551
Do you think it has some magical
quality transforming everything?

31:05.760 --> 31:08.399
The intelligence line
is not an immutable barrier.

31:08.600 --> 31:09.555
Love can cross it.

31:09.760 --> 31:12.638
You can love someone
whose mental capacity is not large.

31:12.840 --> 31:15.673
I know. I have.

31:16.240 --> 31:19.710
Well, there's a mutable barrier, then.
Frank's stupid, we knew.

31:19.920 --> 31:22.718
That he's a rat playboy operator,
I hadrt realised.

31:22.920 --> 31:25.115
I don't want to turn bitter.

31:25.480 --> 31:28.677
I worry for Frank. I care about him.
Well, I'd stop.

31:28.880 --> 31:29.949
No.

31:30.160 --> 31:31.832
I love Frank.

31:32.040 --> 31:33.075
I always will.

31:33.280 --> 31:35.669
If that's the case,
why not fight for him?

31:35.880 --> 31:38.519
Against Priss? I'd never win.
Sure you would.

31:38.720 --> 31:41.757
Priss is a rat. A bitch.

31:41.960 --> 31:43.473
A rat bitch.

31:44.040 --> 31:46.235
Don't blame Priss.

31:46.840 --> 31:51.356
She was crushed
when her blue-eyed Josh left her.

31:52.760 --> 31:54.557
I should've known.

31:54.760 --> 31:57.035
Of course she'd fall for Frank.

31:57.240 --> 32:01.199
Josh and Frank
are both blue-eyed heartbreakers.

32:07.080 --> 32:08.149
Poor Violet.

32:08.360 --> 32:10.430
She's the roommate
who's so self-confident?

32:10.640 --> 32:12.756
Yeah. But now she's a wreck.

32:12.960 --> 32:16.839
But there's no logic
to the algebra of love.

32:17.040 --> 32:18.519
"The algebra of love. "
Mm-hm.

32:18.720 --> 32:20.915
That sounds like the title
to some lame book.

32:21.120 --> 32:23.315
It's a title,
but the book's not lame at all.

32:23.520 --> 32:25.829
Love's algebra?
I thought it was more geometry.

32:26.040 --> 32:28.156
Okay, the title's not good,
but the book is.

32:28.360 --> 32:29.759
What's it say?

32:29.960 --> 32:33.589
Well, that while we're all perverse
in our romantic preferences,

32:33.800 --> 32:37.270
there's actually this logic
or algebra to our perversity,

32:37.480 --> 32:41.268
and it has something to do
with how the species has evolved.

32:41.480 --> 32:43.357
The survival of the species?
Yes.

32:43.560 --> 32:46.552
And whether it will
continue to do so.

32:48.840 --> 32:50.068
No booze?

32:50.280 --> 32:53.829
Just to find the nearest package store,
you had to drive 40 miles.

32:55.160 --> 32:58.072
These aren't so strong.
No, they're really strong.

32:58.280 --> 32:59.508
I think I'd like another.

33:00.440 --> 33:02.749
That wouldn't be a good idea.
Why not?

33:02.960 --> 33:06.032
Well...
Are you trying to stifle me?

33:06.240 --> 33:08.595
Lily?
Oh, hi.

33:08.800 --> 33:12.270
Listen, we're gonna get something
to eat. Why don't you come with us?

33:12.480 --> 33:15.438
I'm with Charlie.
I can see that.

33:15.640 --> 33:18.552
But you really should come.
Why?

33:18.760 --> 33:20.955
I just think it would be a good idea.

33:22.520 --> 33:23.475
But why?

33:23.680 --> 33:25.989
You really must come. I insist.

33:27.320 --> 33:28.878
Lily?

33:31.000 --> 33:32.558
Lily?

33:33.880 --> 33:35.916
Lily, are you angry?

33:37.480 --> 33:39.994
Lily, this is it. We're here.

33:40.200 --> 33:42.077
What's the matter?

33:43.000 --> 33:46.390
That was so rude. He's a nice guy
and you embarrassed him.

33:46.600 --> 33:48.909
He's not nice.
He was trying to get you drunk.

33:49.120 --> 33:51.475
No, he wasrt.
Plying you with martinis?

33:51.680 --> 33:55.468
I was plying myself with martinis.
Come on, the guy's a total sleaze.

33:55.680 --> 33:58.478
A creep.
You don't know anything about him.

33:58.680 --> 34:01.399
The way he sent drinks
over to our table?

34:02.520 --> 34:03.953
Alice.

34:04.160 --> 34:05.559
Alice, what's wrong?

34:05.760 --> 34:07.910
<i>I had no idea
that Xavier could be so mean.</i>

34:08.120 --> 34:10.395
Sounds as if he was just trying
to protect you.

34:10.600 --> 34:13.592
This Charlie Walker sounds like
an operator or playboy type.

34:13.800 --> 34:16.598
No, he's not like that.
He's actually a really nice guy.

34:16.800 --> 34:18.835
I thought he was
a slick businessman.

34:19.040 --> 34:22.077
No. He dresses well,
but he works in strategic development.

34:22.280 --> 34:24.840
What?
Strategic development.

34:25.040 --> 34:28.190
He works at SDA.
Strategic Development Associates.

34:28.400 --> 34:32.029
He's an associate there.
What he is, is a strategic operator.

34:35.320 --> 34:37.514
Violet, are you okay?

34:54.239 --> 34:57.072
Hey, miss, rairs coming!
Better get back!

35:08.760 --> 35:12.639
Polly, have you seen Violet?
No. Is something wrong?

35:12.840 --> 35:14.159
We're not sure.

35:16.960 --> 35:19.315
Violet!

35:30.120 --> 35:31.439
Violet!

35:31.640 --> 35:34.154
Violet!

35:37.560 --> 35:39.198
Violet!
Violet!

35:39.400 --> 35:41.675
Oh, my gosh, what happened?

35:54.320 --> 35:57.312
I don't understand.
What were you doing?

35:57.880 --> 36:00.075
How long were you gone for?

36:00.280 --> 36:03.829
I'm sorry, I don't know.
I lost track of time.

36:05.160 --> 36:06.559
But you feel better now?

36:07.320 --> 36:10.471
Well, cleaner.

36:12.760 --> 36:14.716
She'll say anything
to get in the show.

36:14.920 --> 36:17.753
She'll want doughnuts.
You don't have to be suicidal

36:17.960 --> 36:21.669
to get doughnuts, just depressed.
Clinically depressed. From a clinic.

36:21.880 --> 36:23.359
Would you say you're depressed?

36:23.560 --> 36:24.629
I don't like the term.

36:24.840 --> 36:27.877
I prefer to say I'm in a tailspin.
Oh, my God. A tailspin?

36:28.080 --> 36:29.832
She can't even say
she's depressed.

36:30.040 --> 36:32.713
She's gotta say something special.
Priss was honest.

36:32.920 --> 36:35.798
She was depressed
and she had a right to be in the show.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.389
Now every silly tailspinner's
trying to get in.

36:38.600 --> 36:42.070
The show is for everyone.
No, it isn't, Freak.

36:42.760 --> 36:45.911
To be in the centre's programmes,
you have to be clinically depressed.

36:46.120 --> 36:48.680
That means
that you've been to a clinic,

36:48.880 --> 36:50.916
and they've said
that you're depressed.

36:51.120 --> 36:52.872
Have you been to a clinic?

36:54.520 --> 36:57.717
Have you been to a clinic?
Then you're not clinically depressed.

37:06.520 --> 37:10.957
Violet. Violet. What is it?
Where are you going?

37:13.320 --> 37:17.552
All I wanted was to make Frank
happy. I had all these plans.

37:17.760 --> 37:21.878
Things we could've done together.
I never even got to tell him.

38:03.280 --> 38:06.875
Hey! Where all your boyfriends at?
Come on!

38:07.080 --> 38:09.958
They don't wear bikinis.
They're ladies, they wear thongs.

38:10.160 --> 38:12.151
I can't imagine
where she could've gone.

38:12.720 --> 38:15.598
Wherever she went,
she should be back by now.

38:16.120 --> 38:17.997
How did she seem
when you last saw her?

38:18.200 --> 38:19.713
Really sad about Frank.

38:19.920 --> 38:21.319
Still?
Yeah.

38:21.520 --> 38:25.274
How can someone so smart continue
mooning over a dope like that?

38:25.480 --> 38:28.517
People aren't exactly as you assume.
The Violet you know

38:28.720 --> 38:31.837
bears little resemblance
to the girl I met in seventh grade.

38:32.040 --> 38:33.473
You met Violet in seventh grade?

38:33.680 --> 38:35.910
Well, her name wasrt Violet then.

38:36.440 --> 38:38.431
What's your name?

38:38.640 --> 38:41.279
You can tell us your name.
We won't bite.

38:41.480 --> 38:44.119
What's your name? Tell us.

38:44.320 --> 38:47.471
Are you retarded?
Tell us your name.

38:48.520 --> 38:50.636
Emily Tweeter.

38:52.000 --> 38:55.709
Tweeter? Like a bird?
That's ridiculous.

38:55.920 --> 38:59.356
Tweeter? Like a bird?

38:59.560 --> 39:03.075
Not an easy name to have at that age.
Not at any age.

39:03.280 --> 39:04.315
What was she like?

39:04.520 --> 39:07.034
Timid. Bookish.
Classic scholarship student.

39:07.240 --> 39:08.468
Her parents were writers.

39:08.680 --> 39:12.116
They didn't have a dime.
Finances were the least of her worries.

39:12.320 --> 39:15.198
What do you mean?
Well, she was crazy.

39:15.400 --> 39:18.437
I got stuck rooming with her
on a trip when no one else would.

39:18.640 --> 39:20.676
It was awful.
Did she smell bad?

39:20.880 --> 39:24.634
No. Obsessive cleanliness
was part of her insanity.

39:24.840 --> 39:26.239
You were nice to her.
No.

39:26.440 --> 39:29.159
The idea of being nice
to weird kids hadrt arrived.

39:29.360 --> 39:32.477
Why was she so unpopular?
Well, she was very strange.

39:32.680 --> 39:35.717
Constantly setting herself odd,
repetitive tasks.

39:35.920 --> 39:36.875
Tasks?

39:37.080 --> 39:42.200
For example, on that trip she had
with her a little square suitcase.

39:42.400 --> 39:44.789
<i>The idea came into her head
she had to move it</i>

39:45.000 --> 39:47.230
<i>in a precise pattern
over and over again,</i>

39:47.440 --> 39:50.671
<i>and if she didn't execute this
movement flawlessly 10 times,</i>

39:50.880 --> 39:51.869
<i>she'd start over.</i>

39:52.080 --> 39:55.709
Another was to slide her hand
across her forehead,

39:55.920 --> 39:59.708
<i>trying not to touch her hair
or eyebrows on either side,</i>

39:59.920 --> 40:02.036
<i>also repeating it 10 times.</i>

40:02.240 --> 40:05.755
Any niggling thought she'd touched
the hair, she'd start over.

40:05.960 --> 40:09.111
My God, that is insane.
Why would she do that?

40:09.320 --> 40:13.074
She had the conviction that
if she didn't complete these tasks,

40:13.280 --> 40:14.759
her parents would die.

40:14.960 --> 40:16.678
Was she Catholic?
No.

40:16.880 --> 40:20.031
But what made the whole thing
really sad

40:20.240 --> 40:22.390
was that her parents did die.

40:22.600 --> 40:24.636
Oh, my God.

40:25.600 --> 40:27.318
Violet!

40:32.600 --> 40:34.795
Violet!

40:36.680 --> 40:38.557
Violet!

40:38.760 --> 40:40.637
Violet!

40:41.240 --> 40:42.434
Violet!

40:42.640 --> 40:44.232
Violet!

40:44.440 --> 40:45.589
Violet?

40:48.120 --> 40:50.873
Violet!

40:51.600 --> 40:54.194
Violet, where are you?

41:23.800 --> 41:27.918
Something's wrong, isn't it, dear?
You mind my asking?

41:28.120 --> 41:30.918
Well, I do mind a little.

41:31.640 --> 41:33.471
Excuse me, Your Highness.
I'm sorry.

41:33.680 --> 41:36.592
It's just kind of awkward to talk about.
No matter.

41:36.800 --> 41:39.519
I hope you haven't come
to get run over on the highway.

41:39.720 --> 41:41.915
What do you mean?
Suicides.

41:42.520 --> 41:45.318
They come down from the university.
Jump out in the road.

41:45.520 --> 41:47.078
Get hit by the blind curve.

41:47.960 --> 41:49.916
Hope you're not one of them.

41:50.120 --> 41:51.553
Do I look like one of them?

41:53.600 --> 41:54.749
I don't know.

41:54.960 --> 41:56.109
Maybe.

41:57.080 --> 42:00.959
Messy people, suicides. Think only
of themselves and their own deaths.

42:01.160 --> 42:02.434
Not what comes after.

42:02.640 --> 42:04.437
They leave quite a mess.
Mm-hm.

42:04.640 --> 42:05.595
They don't stick around

42:05.800 --> 42:06.915
to clean it up.
Mm-mm.

42:10.440 --> 42:13.750
So you're not one of those depressed
students from the university?

42:13.960 --> 42:17.589
I don't like the word "depressed. "
I prefer to say that I'm in a tailspin.

42:17.800 --> 42:18.869
A tailspin?

42:19.080 --> 42:22.356
Does this tailspin involve a man?
Yes, it does.

42:22.560 --> 42:24.949
But I'm not as crazy as I was
up till yesterday.

42:25.160 --> 42:29.119
Apparently that's due to the salutary
effect of scent on the human psyche.

42:29.320 --> 42:32.756
Its importance is, I believe,
almost incalculable.

42:33.640 --> 42:35.915
At the motel,
I happened to use this soap.

42:36.120 --> 42:39.476
It was provided to me as a courtesy
as one of the guests.

42:39.680 --> 42:40.999
That an economical motel

42:41.200 --> 42:44.158
would provide such good soap
is quite unusual.

42:44.360 --> 42:47.318
The scent is very precise.
Really?

42:47.520 --> 42:53.072
Tell me if it provokes any particular
reaction in your psyche. A state of mind.

42:57.960 --> 42:58.915
Hmm.

43:04.960 --> 43:06.757
I always knew she was unstable.

43:06.960 --> 43:09.793
They're gonna have her photo
at the registrar's.

43:30.680 --> 43:33.148
Violet! Violet!

43:33.360 --> 43:34.839
You're back! You're okay!

43:36.120 --> 43:37.599
Not really.

43:37.800 --> 43:39.870
Oh, my gosh, Violet,
we were so worried.

43:40.080 --> 43:42.036
Why didn't you tell us
or leave a note?

43:42.240 --> 43:44.196
I did leave a note.

43:44.400 --> 43:46.914
Would that be a suicide note?

43:53.800 --> 43:56.360
I wouldn't leave without a note.
Where did you go?

43:56.560 --> 43:59.711
I took the train to Villafranca
and checked into a motel there.

43:59.920 --> 44:01.558
The Motel 6?
No, the Motel 4.

44:01.760 --> 44:04.832
It's even less expensive.
The Motel 4 in Villafranca?

44:05.480 --> 44:07.994
My God, you really were suicidal.
Why'd you go?

44:08.200 --> 44:09.428
I had to do something.

44:09.640 --> 44:14.077
And you really thought you were
gonna find the answer in Villafranca?

44:14.280 --> 44:17.113
I'm not sure what I expected,
but I might have found it.

44:17.320 --> 44:18.719
What?

44:22.520 --> 44:23.475
Soap?

44:25.560 --> 44:28.028
This scent and this soap

44:28.240 --> 44:30.629
is what gives me hope.

44:42.280 --> 44:43.838
Hello?

44:45.520 --> 44:47.238
Hello?

44:47.960 --> 44:49.837
Is anyone here?

44:51.120 --> 44:53.156
Hello?

44:55.040 --> 44:56.314
Lily?

44:56.520 --> 44:57.669
Hello?
Oh, my gosh.

44:57.880 --> 45:00.110
I couldn't understand
where everyone was.

45:01.080 --> 45:03.435
Sorry, I just went out
to get some things.

45:03.640 --> 45:05.437
Where's Alice?
Gone.

45:06.280 --> 45:07.679
What do you mean?

45:07.880 --> 45:09.199
Left.

45:09.640 --> 45:10.595
We broke up.

45:10.800 --> 45:13.837
But when you called, you said...
I know, I'm sorry.

45:14.800 --> 45:17.109
I thought it better
to tell you in person.

45:21.240 --> 45:25.199
Alice couldn't control her jealousy.
It completely overwhelmed her.

45:25.400 --> 45:27.755
Really? What was she jealous of?

45:27.960 --> 45:29.188
Come on.

45:29.400 --> 45:30.628
No, what?

45:30.840 --> 45:32.239
You.

45:32.440 --> 45:34.908
After a while,
I just couldn't handle it.

45:35.440 --> 45:37.670
Things became impossible.

45:38.680 --> 45:40.716
She was jealous of me?

45:41.560 --> 45:43.118
Of course.

45:46.680 --> 45:49.035
Would it be okay if we watch a film?

45:49.240 --> 45:50.958
Yes. Um...

45:51.160 --> 45:52.559
What would you like to see?

45:52.760 --> 45:56.389
<i>I thought maybe Truffaut's
Baisers v olés. Stolen Kisses.</i>

45:56.600 --> 45:57.828
Do you know it?

45:58.040 --> 45:59.519
No, is it new?

45:59.720 --> 46:01.039
It's a classic
of French New Wave cinema.

46:02.560 --> 46:03.515
I think you'll like it.

46:03.720 --> 46:06.234
But it's in colour?
Yeah.

46:07.320 --> 46:10.153
You don't know Truffaut?
No.

46:11.000 --> 46:12.956
<i>Do you know Godard,
À bout de souffle?</i>

46:31.160 --> 46:33.594
Why was Alice so jealous?
What do you think?

46:33.800 --> 46:35.836
She was jealous
because Lily's lovely.

46:36.040 --> 46:38.156
I don't know.
They had a lot of problems.

46:38.360 --> 46:39.873
Of course.

46:40.080 --> 46:41.911
You wouldn't break up
a happy couple.

46:42.120 --> 46:44.156
What's that?
A note Frank left.

46:44.360 --> 46:46.920
Really? Recently?
No, when we were together.

46:47.120 --> 46:49.315
Now that most correspondence
is electronic,

46:49.520 --> 46:51.909
it's rare to be left anything
written by hand.

46:52.120 --> 46:53.269
Frank can write by hand?

46:54.040 --> 46:56.793
What is it?
It's not very important.

46:57.000 --> 46:58.558
It's just all I have.

46:58.760 --> 47:02.594
What's it say?
"Out for brewskis. Back in a giff. "

47:02.800 --> 47:03.755
What's a "giff"?

47:03.960 --> 47:06.155
One of those little motor scooters,
isn't it?

47:06.360 --> 47:09.397
I'm sure he meant to write "jiff"
with a J. "Back in a jiff. "

47:09.600 --> 47:10.669
But he wrote "giff. "

47:10.880 --> 47:14.190
Could Frank be dyslexic?
No. Dyslexics are intelligent.

47:16.120 --> 47:18.236
What's that?
Frank's bean ball.

47:18.440 --> 47:22.069
He gave you his bean ball?
Not exactly. This is an extra.

47:22.280 --> 47:25.909
He thought he'd leave it here
just in case he lost his other one.

47:26.120 --> 47:29.271
Gosh, Violet, you've really
gotta stop thinking about Frank.

47:29.480 --> 47:31.675
Why? I don't wanna stop
thinking about him.

47:32.440 --> 47:35.910
Recently I had a thought
that cheered me up a lot.

47:36.440 --> 47:38.556
Life is like a long, flowing river,

47:38.760 --> 47:42.833
and as a long, flowing river, some
debris you never expect to see again

47:43.040 --> 47:45.838
is almost certain to reappear
floating to the surface.

47:46.040 --> 47:49.077
Frank and I may very well
be together again one day.

47:49.280 --> 47:51.919
Maybe it'll take years,
but somewhere down the line,

47:52.120 --> 47:55.999
he's very likely to pop up again,
and I'll be there to catch him.

48:07.040 --> 48:09.429
I don't think
we've spoken about this.

48:09.640 --> 48:10.595
What?

48:10.800 --> 48:14.349
Have you been to the south of France?
To the walled city of Carcassonne?

48:14.560 --> 48:17.996
I've never been anywhere.
But you've seen pictures of it.

48:18.200 --> 48:20.270
No, I don't think so.

48:22.720 --> 48:24.995
Oh, it's fascinating.

48:25.200 --> 48:28.749
I'd like to visit.
You never studied the Cathars?

48:32.520 --> 48:34.238
They were a religious movement,

48:34.440 --> 48:35.634
very idealistic,

48:35.840 --> 48:38.115
located mostly
in the southwest of France

48:38.320 --> 48:40.311
that the Catholic Church
repressed.

48:40.520 --> 48:43.159
Oh, my God. The Catholic Church is,
like, always bad.

48:43.360 --> 48:45.874
Ideas can't be killed
as easily as people.

48:46.080 --> 48:48.674
Especially such enlightened ones
as the Cathars held.

48:48.880 --> 48:52.509
In recent years, more and more people
have returned to their beliefs.

48:53.000 --> 48:56.310
So you're a Cathar?

48:56.520 --> 48:58.750
Yes. I aspire to be.

48:58.960 --> 49:02.748
I'm trying to follow the path
the Cathars marked out.

49:02.960 --> 49:05.110
That's so impressive.

49:05.320 --> 49:08.153
I can tell you we didn't have
any Cathars back home.

49:08.360 --> 49:10.715
I think you'd be surprised.

49:29.560 --> 49:30.675
In the Cathar view,

49:30.880 --> 49:34.589
the highest form of lovemaking
avoids procreation entirely.

49:34.800 --> 49:36.677
Sure. Condoms, right?

49:37.960 --> 49:39.632
Well, according to Cathar ideas,

49:39.840 --> 49:43.833
sex with condoms is just a parody
of the procreative act.

49:44.040 --> 49:46.076
Mm. What do you mean?

49:46.280 --> 49:49.192
The standard, cliché form
of sexual intercourse

49:49.400 --> 49:52.312
is for the man to approach
a woman from the front.

49:52.840 --> 49:55.559
Cathar lovemaking,
I think you'll find very fulfilling.

49:55.760 --> 49:58.433
I'll be very careful, we'll go slowly.

49:58.640 --> 50:00.039
It'll be a new experience,

50:00.240 --> 50:04.631
but one which I think you'll find
brings an inexpressible closeness.

50:37.400 --> 50:39.516
Might your drinks-buying friend
be around?

50:39.720 --> 50:42.109
It would be great
to get complimentary cocktails.

50:42.320 --> 50:44.470
Charlie? No.
Do you still see him at all?

50:44.680 --> 50:46.511
He calls from time to time.
He does?

50:46.720 --> 50:49.518
Why don't you introduce us?
Why should I introduce you?

50:49.720 --> 50:51.392
Because you know him,
and we don't.

50:51.600 --> 50:52.953
So?

50:53.160 --> 50:54.115
"So?"

50:54.760 --> 50:57.718
"So" is probably the unkindest word
in the English language.

50:57.920 --> 51:01.959
I can't bear it. I think it should
be outlawed. "So. "

51:02.160 --> 51:03.309
You're crazy.

51:03.520 --> 51:05.272
Come on, Lily, you have Xavier.

51:05.480 --> 51:08.950
You can't keep two guys for yourself.
Guys do that all the time.

51:09.480 --> 51:10.879
We're not guys, fortunately.

51:11.080 --> 51:14.117
It's unconscionable for you not
to bring him and introduce us.

51:14.320 --> 51:17.437
Charlie is a friend. He's a nice guy.

51:17.640 --> 51:19.039
What do you mean?

51:19.240 --> 51:22.312
I hate to think what'd happen
if you got your claws into him.

51:22.520 --> 51:23.794
That's outrageous.

51:24.000 --> 51:24.989
We're perfectly nice.

51:25.200 --> 51:28.112
We've met lots of pathetic guys
and nothing bad's happened.

51:28.320 --> 51:30.993
Charlie's not pathetic.
Well, all the better, then.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.309
The Roman Holidays
will be coming soon.

51:44.520 --> 51:47.432
What's that?
A festival Roman Letter Clubs put on.

51:47.640 --> 51:49.517
A kind of moron jamboree.

51:49.720 --> 51:52.951
The Roman elements are the worship
of Bacchus, Beerus and Blotto.

51:53.160 --> 51:55.355
It could've all been so uplifting.
Charlie.

51:55.920 --> 51:57.751
Hey, Charlie.

51:57.960 --> 52:00.793
Hey. What are you doing here?

52:01.000 --> 52:04.037
Have you the day off?
Yeah.

52:05.560 --> 52:09.473
This is my friend Charlie,
whom I think I've mentioned.

52:09.680 --> 52:12.638
And, Charlie, these are my
roommates. This is, um...

52:13.040 --> 52:16.794
This is Rose.
And this is Heather. And Violet.

52:17.280 --> 52:20.317
Charlie works
for Strategic Development Associates.

52:20.520 --> 52:22.078
He's an associate there.

52:22.280 --> 52:23.998
You work in strategic development?

52:24.200 --> 52:26.031
You've heard of it?
Of course, yes.

52:26.240 --> 52:29.437
My cousin Jay in Philadelphia works
in strategic development.

52:29.640 --> 52:31.232
Something business-related?

52:31.440 --> 52:34.238
Mostly business,
but any kind of organisation.

52:34.440 --> 52:38.877
Only businesses pay the big bucks.
Nonprofits and government pay well.

52:39.080 --> 52:41.310
That's how they keep
from having profits,

52:41.520 --> 52:44.239
by paying lots of money
to companies like yours.

52:44.440 --> 52:48.592
Excuse me, but aren't you in Professor
Ryars course at the Ed School?

52:49.440 --> 52:50.668
No.

52:50.880 --> 52:53.474
You're not in Professor Ryars
Flit Lit course?

52:53.680 --> 52:54.874
No.

52:55.080 --> 52:58.197
Flit Lit?
The dandy tradition in literature.

52:58.400 --> 53:00.755
I'm sure I've seen you there.
Yeah, I'm sorry.

53:00.960 --> 53:03.838
I'm not in any courses
at the Ed School. Good to meet you.

53:04.040 --> 53:06.315
It was great to see you.
Bye.

53:07.720 --> 53:09.438
God, Violet, what was that about?

53:09.640 --> 53:12.029
That guy is definitely
in Professor Ryars class.

53:12.240 --> 53:15.869
Not possible. He has a fulltime job
for Strategic Development Associates.

53:16.080 --> 53:17.274
He never got his coffee.

53:17.480 --> 53:19.198
Why lie about something like that?

53:19.400 --> 53:21.118
He's lying.

53:21.320 --> 53:24.437
I find that very attractive.

53:24.640 --> 53:25.868
What are you going to do?

53:26.080 --> 53:28.753
I'm gonna stop cutting
Professor Ryars class.

53:32.800 --> 53:35.997
It can be argued that Firbank
was too little disciplined,

53:36.200 --> 53:39.510
too unserious
in his unseriousness

53:39.720 --> 53:42.553
to create works of enduring value.

53:42.760 --> 53:46.196
But as a liberating influence
on later writers such as Waugh,

53:46.400 --> 53:48.789
his importance
should not be discounted.

53:49.720 --> 53:52.951
It's not Firbank's work itself
but the idea of his work

53:53.160 --> 53:55.037
that so helped later writers

53:55.240 --> 53:58.277
as Thomas Love Peacock
did in the previous century.

53:59.640 --> 54:01.596
I'm not gonna come anymore.

54:03.040 --> 54:05.270
What a waste of time.
Charlie.

54:05.480 --> 54:06.595
Charlie.

54:07.240 --> 54:09.515
Charlie?
Charlie, you are taking the course.

54:09.720 --> 54:10.869
Charlie?

54:11.080 --> 54:12.035
Who's Charlie?

54:12.240 --> 54:14.549
Fred, what's going on?
Fred?

54:14.760 --> 54:17.479
Uh-oh. Fred. Sounds
like you got some explaining to do.

54:21.320 --> 54:24.312
Well, you were lying.
I wasrt lying, I was making it up.

54:24.520 --> 54:25.748
Why were you making it up?

54:25.960 --> 54:29.589
If you were an eighth-year Ed School
student, would you advertise that?

54:29.800 --> 54:33.395
Eighth year. Impressive.
But your whole life was a lie.

54:33.600 --> 54:35.909
Dressing up in suits.
Buying people drinks.

54:36.120 --> 54:37.951
The suits were real.
The drinks, real.

54:38.160 --> 54:40.799
Not just drinks for people.
They were for cute girls.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.992
There's a perfectly rational,
easily explainable agenda.

54:44.200 --> 54:46.077
So it was a playboy
or operator move.

54:46.280 --> 54:50.558
Of course. Transparently so.
I admire that. Drinks are expensive.

54:50.760 --> 54:53.638
But strategic development,
that was made up too?

54:54.360 --> 54:57.238
You said your cousin Jay was in it.
What cousin Jay?

54:57.440 --> 55:00.318
In Philadelphia.
I don't have a cousin in Philadelphia.

55:00.800 --> 55:04.270
You said your cousin Jay
was working in strategic development.

55:04.480 --> 55:08.155
I was just saying that to be friendly.
To make a kind of link.

55:09.320 --> 55:13.552
So your name's Fred something?
Yes. Fred something.

55:13.760 --> 55:16.832
Packenstacker?
Oh, my God. How crazy.

55:17.400 --> 55:20.392
He's completely insane.
I almost dated him.

55:20.600 --> 55:23.831
You can say that about a lot of guys.
I don't think he's crazy.

55:24.040 --> 55:27.510
Making up an entirely fictitious
identity, that's not crazy?

55:27.720 --> 55:29.836
It's insane. It's psycho.

55:30.040 --> 55:32.031
Violet's identity is made up.

55:32.240 --> 55:34.754
I don't think she's crazy.
No, I am.

55:34.960 --> 55:36.359
No, this is different.

55:36.560 --> 55:40.269
It's crazy and pathetic.

55:40.480 --> 55:43.472
All that about strategic development
he just made up.

55:44.920 --> 55:46.717
Don't tell me that's not weird.

55:46.920 --> 55:48.797
I've heard of strategic development.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.195
I think it's something
pretty important.

55:51.640 --> 55:54.552
Violet, you're not gonna
start going out with him.

55:55.200 --> 55:56.553
You're not, are you?

55:56.760 --> 55:58.910
Well, we had planned
to go to the library.

55:59.120 --> 56:00.951
Not to the stacks, I hope.
Yes.

56:01.160 --> 56:03.754
Oh, my gosh, do you realise
how dangerous that is?

56:03.960 --> 56:05.313
Dangerous?
Yes, the stacks.

56:05.520 --> 56:08.114
They're dark and deserted.
Anything could happen.

56:08.320 --> 56:09.355
It's true.

56:09.560 --> 56:11.516
With the study habits
at Seven Oaks,

56:11.720 --> 56:13.756
your body won't be found
until spring.

56:13.960 --> 56:17.270
Promise you won't go with him
to the stacks. Please.

56:18.560 --> 56:20.835
Okay. I'll suggest
the Randall Room.

56:21.560 --> 56:24.791
Don't suggest. Insist.
And please not at night.

56:25.600 --> 56:27.033
Okay.

56:29.880 --> 56:31.438
What are you reading?

56:33.000 --> 56:36.151
Have you chosen a topic
for your final paper?

56:36.360 --> 56:38.396
The decline of decadence.

56:38.600 --> 56:40.795
You think that decadence
has declined?

56:41.000 --> 56:45.152
Definitely. Bigtime.
Major, major decline.

56:45.360 --> 56:46.634
How?

56:46.840 --> 56:48.751
How or in what ways?

56:50.400 --> 56:51.355
Either.

56:52.360 --> 56:56.148
Well, take the flit movement
in literature, or homosexuality.

56:56.360 --> 56:59.511
It's gone completely downill,
right down the tubes. Poof!

57:01.400 --> 57:03.072
What do you mean?

57:03.280 --> 57:06.078
Before, homosexuality was
something refined, hidden,

57:06.280 --> 57:10.717
aspiring to the highest levels
of creativity and often achieving it.

57:10.920 --> 57:14.469
Now it seems to be musclebound
morons running around in T-shirts.

57:14.680 --> 57:16.750
It's pretty disillusioning.

57:17.320 --> 57:20.392
Are you gay?

57:20.600 --> 57:24.388
Not especially, but in another era,
it might have had some appeal.

57:24.600 --> 57:29.151
Now I just don't see the point.
You might be romanticising the past.

57:29.360 --> 57:32.511
We'll never know. The past is gone,
so we might as well romanticise it.

57:32.720 --> 57:35.029
Hmm. You could be right.

57:35.240 --> 57:37.515
I wanted to ask, how's Lily?

57:37.720 --> 57:38.869
Lily.

57:39.680 --> 57:41.272
She's okay.

57:53.520 --> 57:56.637
Here, check it out.
A.L.A. Nope. Hello. Good afternoon.

57:56.840 --> 58:00.150
Check it out. The A.L.A. Heard of it?
We have a meeting on Tuesday.

58:00.360 --> 58:02.510
You should come by.
What is the A.L.A.?

58:02.720 --> 58:06.474
Oh.
Just join us. Come Tuesday.

58:06.920 --> 58:08.876
I think you'll really like it.

58:13.000 --> 58:14.877
So...

58:15.880 --> 58:19.793
A fellow was passing these out, and
invited us to a meeting on Tuesday.

58:23.040 --> 58:24.473
The A.L.A.?

58:24.680 --> 58:26.318
Oh, my God.

58:27.760 --> 58:30.069
I thought it was something related.

58:30.600 --> 58:32.113
No?

58:33.600 --> 58:35.875
The A.L.A. Has got
nothing to do with us.

58:36.080 --> 58:37.991
Can't you see that?

58:40.200 --> 58:42.475
The way we express love
has meaning.

58:42.680 --> 58:44.796
It's in the context
of something beautiful.

58:45.000 --> 58:48.151
We're following our creator's
teaching. Aspiring to an ideal.

58:48.360 --> 58:51.193
A beautiful one that brings
an inexpressible closeness.

58:51.400 --> 58:53.595
Not just to each other, but...

58:54.640 --> 58:57.313
For the A.L.A.,
and those like them,

58:57.520 --> 59:00.159
the love act
is just hedonistic pleasure-seeking

59:00.360 --> 59:02.237
of a perverted nature.

59:02.440 --> 59:05.591
I can't believe you'd think we had
anything in common with them.

59:05.800 --> 59:06.949
We don't.

59:07.160 --> 59:09.435
Nothing, not an iota.

59:09.640 --> 59:11.551
My God, can't you see that?

59:14.920 --> 59:17.275
Lily. Lily, come back.

59:17.480 --> 59:20.517

You don't wanna talk about it?

01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:20.149
I don't understand.

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:24.194
You don't understand what?
What is non-procreative lovemaking?

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:27.039
It could be a lot of things.
Yeah, but in this case?

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:29.629
We don't have to talk about this.
I don't mind.

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:31.910

what this is about?

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:33.155
Well, if...

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:35.555
Cathars don't believe
in procreative sex.

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:37.876
They don't have intercourse
the usual way.

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:39.308
The usual way?

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:42.034
You don't have to talk about this.
No, it's okay.

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:45.630
It's the normal way, from the front
where you can have procreation,

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:49.116
not from the other side,
where you can't.

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:51.993
The other side?
That's their religion?

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:54.634
No, but it's the direction
their beliefs head in.

01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:56.956
When they express love,
that's what they do.

01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:00.079
Wow. How horrible.

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:01.549

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:57.669
I lost the other one,
and with everything that's happened,

01:02:57.880 --> 01:02:59.518
I'd really like to have it.

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:02.349
Nothing like some bean ball
after a breakup.

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:06.235
Yeah. God, you're smart.

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:08.317
You always get it.

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:10.351
Whatever I say,

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:12.516
you understand.

01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:14.551
Man.

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:20.948
<i># Lucy, you know
The world must be flat #</i>

01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:23.632
<i># 'Cause when people leave town #</i>

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:25.512
Hey, Heather.

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:26.869
Hey.
Hey.

01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:28.195
Hey.

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:29.719
Hey.

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:31.355
Hey.

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:34.393
<i># Put the pedal to the metal
'fore they change their mind #</i>

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:35.999
Hey.

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:38.668
<i># Howl at the moon

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:41.599

<i># It's a small town

<i># Bobby told Lucy

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:02.879
Violet.

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:04.433
Violet, what's wrong?

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:06.358
I'm sorry. Lily's lovely.

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:09.958
Now she's free. Go. I understand.

01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:29.632
Latin! Et cetera!

01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:43.435
Yeah!
Yeah! Ha-ha!

01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:51.678
This is what comes
from not teaching Latin in the schools.

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:55.634
Yeah, it's moronic and boorish, but
it's also kind of fun, don't you think?

01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:57.273
No.

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:15.479
What's that stench?

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:27.475
I suppose this is what happens when
decadence rots society from within.

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:29.113
And from without.

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:31.276
Such a society is, I fear,

01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:34.552
destined to fail and be overrun.

01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:36.512
Maybe that's good.

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:50.830
Finally. It's about time those cesspools
were drained.

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:04.030
What colour would you say
that chair is?

01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:05.639
That's a chair?

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:07.671
I have no idea.

01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:11.959
Guys have preferences.
You're going to accept that?

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:15.197
You're not going to do anything?
There's nothing to be done.

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:17.834
Fred must know his own mind.
Oh, really?

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.758
I seriously doubt that.
Come on.

01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:22.554
Lily's got that slender,
delicately swelling beauty

01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:25.672
that no man can resist.
Okay, you're probably right.

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:29.111
Poor Lily. Just think of all Xavier
put her through.

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:34.668
He just used her body.
And not even the right side.

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:38.950
Have you noticed that good people
tend to have large posteriors?

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:41.720
Not everyone, by any means.
I know it's not logical.

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:43.353
But it does seem to be true.

01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:47.314
The genetic link between morality
and large posteriors?

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:49.158
Yes, I think that's well known.

01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:51.920
You and Violet have that build.
It's nice.

01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:55.590
You're still very attractive,
but also sensible and moralistic.

01:06:55.800 --> 01:07:00.316
I don't. I have narrow hips,
but also no very strong principles.

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:05.269
Yes?

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.118
Oh, hi.

01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:13.392
Hi, Frank.
Hey, Heather. Wow.

01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:15.517
So I guess you guys all heard.

01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:18.075
University's closing
all the Roman Letter Houses.

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:21.955
Sorry. This year's Roman Holidays
did seem like the end of civilisation,

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:25.869
but when civilisation ends people
are going to need a place to stay.

01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:27.832
Man.

01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:29.439
It's bad.

01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:31.551
<i>It's that bastard
from The Complainer.</i>

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:34.228
Someone from the administratiors
been reading it.

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:36.158
Hard to believe.

01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:37.475
Bastard.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.479
Listen,

01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:44.955
we were wondering

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:49.278
if you thought it would be okay
if we stayed at the suicide centre.

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:53.756
Okay, sure. That sounds like
a good stopgap measure.

01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:56.190
Thank you. Thank you.

01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:01.076
Oh, um...
So there's one more thing.

01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:03.551
Remember that bean ball
we talked about?

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:05.113
Yes.

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:07.555
You think I could pick that up?

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:10.991
Just after everything
that's happened, it...

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:13.839
I could really use it right now.

01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:15.189
Yes.

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:22.948
What's that?

01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:24.388
What?
The note.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:28.274
Oh. One gets so few things written
by hand anymore, I guess I kept it.

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:32.077
"Out for brewskis, back in a giff. "

01:08:32.279 --> 01:08:33.917
What's a giff?

01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:36.189
It's the scooter.
Like a Vespa, right?

01:08:36.399 --> 01:08:39.358
That's what I thought.
I was thinking about getting one.

01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:42.518
You must've meant "jiff. "
"Back in a jiff. "

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:45.917
And then misspelled it,
or spelled it in a nonstandard way.

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:50.272
Oh... Heh. Yeah.
Not a good speller.

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:51.794
Mm.

01:08:58.160 --> 01:08:59.513
Thanks.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.834
You're great.
Priss was such a bitch.

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:05.473
Damn. Ha-ha.

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:07.599
Damn.

01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:12.274
Hey, Heather.

01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:18.238
Bye.

01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:20.877
Bye. Ha-ha.

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:23.631
Bye.
Bye.

01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:31.192
Wow. Heather is really cute.

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:34.792
She, um, going out with anyone?

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.274
There might be something
between her and Thor.

01:09:37.479 --> 01:09:39.118
Thor?

01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:42.714
Damn. Heather and Thor?

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:46.232
Damn.

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:52.719
I'm worried about Thor.
It's hard for us to imagine

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:55.195
how upsetting it is
not knowing the colours.

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:57.311
It's impossible for me to imagine.

01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:00.398
When Thor sees a rainbow,
it's so much gibberish to him.

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:03.637
There was one this afternoon.
Oh, my gosh, he took it hard.

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:05.910
Recently, there was a parade
in the city

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:09.271
where the marchers carried
rainbow-coloured flags and banners.

01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:11.835
Thor was so upset.
He had no idea what it meant.

01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:13.439
What kind of retard is he?

01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:15.790
See, that's the conclusion
people jump to.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.592
Well, it is somewhat understandable.

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:19.518
Not if you knew the full story.

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:20.789
What's the full story?

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.911
You know how parents
love bragging

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:25.634
about how precocious
their children are?

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:28.115
Thor's parents
had become precocity addicts,

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:31.198
constantly needing
an ever-greater precocity fix.

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:34.790
He should've entered kindergarten.
They pushed him into first grade.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.036
"Thor skipped a grade,"
they could tell.

01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:40.915
What Thor's parents failed to consider
is the work done in nursery school.

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:44.157
Key being the study of colours.
I suppose they just assumed

01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:46.635
that colours are knowledge
people pick up.

01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:49.035
Like, for example,
not stepping on sidewalk cracks.

01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:52.152
What's that?

01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:54.191
I think Rose is sleeping.

01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:57.119
Am I boring?

01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:58.673
No, not at all.

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:02.875
When you have problems, it's great
to hear someone else's idiotic ones.

01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:04.798
Please go on.

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:07.990
Wow.
What?

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:11.192
What you said about depressed
people being mean, you werert joking.

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:13.868
I'm sorry, you're right. Please go on.

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:16.039
No.

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:20.153
I'm sorry. You know how I am.
Please continue.

01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:25.593
Thor decided he absolutely
had to learn all the colours.

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:27.631
Both primary and mixed.

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:31.230
He's been hitting the books hard,
and thought he'd mastered them.

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:34.000
Then, in town, he said,
"That traffic light's blue. "

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:36.077
I had to say, "No, it's green. "

01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:37.269
He was really upset.

01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:38.549
Oh, hi, Lily.

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:40.189
Hi.

01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:42.197
We were worried about you.

01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:47.675
<i>I can't bear this tension with Lily.</i>

01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:50.235
It's terrible to have the group
divided this way.

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:51.873
Better not next to Robertson.

01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:54.599
What?

01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:56.472
Didrt you hear?

01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:58.989
Ed students have been going
up to the roof

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:01.031
and throwing themselves off.

01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:04.915
But it's only two storeys.
Yes, I know.

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:08.271
It's terrible. Not high enough to kill,
but high enough to maim.

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:11.040
And particularly dangerous
for anyone below.

01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:13.595
I've got to forget about Fred.

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:15.399
But you really liked him.

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:20.515
This whole thing of a person meeting
someone else first, it's so arbitrary.

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:25.589
It's terrible and cruel.
I have to say, I was wrong about Fred.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:28.075
I thought he was a playboy
or operator type.

01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:32.319
In fact, he's just another guy rendered
helpless by the attentions of a pretty girl.

01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:35.193
Cary! No, don't!
I love you!

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:38.232
Why did you do that?
Oh, my God!

01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:40.158
Cary, I love you!

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:44.678
Isn't the Ed School
essentially a teacher's college?

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:45.915
Yeah.

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:48.429
If they can't even
destroy themselves,

01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:50.835
how are they going to teach
America's youth?

01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:54.715
# It's just that my happiness
Finally commences #

01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:57.480
# Things are looking up #

01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:00.717
# I've been looking
The landscape over #

01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:04.276
# And it's covered
With four-leaf clover #

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:06.994
# Oh, things are looking up #

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:11.398
# Since love looked up at me #

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:17.233
# But no more
Will I be the mourner #

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:20.159
# For I've certainly turned
the corner ##

01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:23.193
What do you think you're doing?
Sorry. Did I disturb you?

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:25.960
Why are you wearing tap shoes?
You out of your mind?

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:29.118
I think that's pretty clear.
I'm so sick of that.

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:30.833
Oh, really? I think it's cute.

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:35.113
Since you won't be treating us to
one of your incompetent tap routines,

01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:39.029
why don't you take those things off?
No. We'll do the routine. Rose.

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:42.550
Madge wants to see the routine.
I don't want to see your routine.

01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:45.149
I asked you to take those off.
We need a break.

01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:46.395
Just briefly, please.

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:49.319
It's helpful to have an audience.
Rose, the music.

01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:51.112
I'm gonna report you.

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:19.633
Suzanne.

01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:23.992
For me, it'd be Madame Curie,
Simone de Beauvoir,

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:26.555
and Margaret Sanger.
Good.

01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:28.674
Violet.

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:30.677
I would say

01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:33.476
Richard Strauss,
Roderick Charleston,

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:35.398
and Chubbard Checker.

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:39.673
Richard Strauss? The composer?
Yes, that was one of his posts.

01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:43.111
I'm not familiar with the others.
Could you tell us who they are?

01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:46.471
Yes. Each one of these men
started an international dance craze.

01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:49.831
Richard Strauss, the waltz.
Roderick Charleston, the Charleston.

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:51.837
Chubbard Checker,
known as Chubby,

01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:53.712
the dance we know as the twist.

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:56.036
Why do you consider
a dance craze important?

01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:59.391
Dance crazes enance
and elevate the human experience,

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:01.636
bringing together
millions of people

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:04.638
in a joyous celebration
of our God-given faculties,

01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:07.354
and passing these modes
of physical expression

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:10.711
down through the generations.
Though not so much anymore.

01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:13.388
I thought...
Well, I assumed that the Charleston

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:15.909
was named after
the city of Charleston.

01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:18.918
No. Though that misconception
is quite widely held.

01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:21.156
It was Roderick Charleston.

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:24.238
Usually, behind some
great creative phenomenon,

01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:26.715
there's a person, not a town.

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:29.673
This is so exciting.
It's really great, isn't it?

01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:32.155
Hey, could you guys help?
Sure. What's up?

01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:33.759
We need help packing soap,

01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:36.349
which we'll distribute
to Doar Dorm residents.

01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:37.629
Cool.

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:40.877
What would you say are effective
means to fight depression?

01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:44.277
Maybe some of your DU brothers
have an idea?

01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:49.429
Uh... Beer?
No. Beer's a downer.

01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:53.519
Cocktails. Hard liquor and spirits
is what really gives you a lift.

01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:55.199
It's interesting what you say.

01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:58.710
My cousin Jay is a medical officer
in Philadelphia.

01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:00.148
He says that alcoholism,

01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:03.511
by which I mean chronic,
excessive consumption of alcohol,

01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:06.757
is the primary self-administered
treatment for depression.

01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:08.154
Cool.
No.

01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:10.590
It leaves you much worse off
than before.

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:13.360
Oh, no, not me.
I just boot and then I feel fine.

01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:17.553
By "boot" do you mean vomit?
Yes.

01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:21.912
No. None of the effective anti-suicide
treatments involve vomiting.

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:25.430
Hygiene?
Exactly.

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:26.834
It's very important.

01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:29.315
That's why we have such hope
in the wonder bar.

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:31.078
Do you know its scent?

01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:39.359
Wow.
Transformative, we think.

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:44.193
This is so exciting.
When should we go over there?

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:47.039
I don't think there's any rush.
I'd like to go soon.

01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:51.028
Doar Dorm has the highest fatality
rate, as well as the worst hygiene.

01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:52.229
Highest suicide rate.

01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:55.671
Fatality rate. It's uncertain
what percentage were intentional

01:16:55.880 --> 01:16:58.997
and how many were just due
to unawareness of gravity's laws.

01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:02.715
I can just see those guys getting
the gold packages, opening them,

01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:05.115
and finding
the good-smelling soap inside.

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:07.515
The cute packaging
should prove irresistible.

01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:10.792
And once clean, they'll start
to see the world with new eyes.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.433
The change could be dramatic.

01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:15.473
Doar Dorm
could soon become Dior Dorm.

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:18.953
I doubt that,
to be perfectly, absolutely honest.

01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:21.674
I love the idea. Dior Dorm.

01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:24.440
I adore optimism,
even when it's completely absurd.

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:27.996
Perhaps especially then.
Great. Ready? Let's go.

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:31.479
Let's hurry.

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:34.035
Let's not get our hopes up too high,
Heather.

01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:37.994
No, you said yourself,
the wonder bar is transformative.

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:40.316
Hey, Violet. Hi.
Hi.

01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:42.317
Where you going?
Doar Dorm.

01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:45.193
Fred, hi.
Hey.

01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:50.713
Good one.

01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:53.272
Oh, no.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.752
Oh, my God.

01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:09.111
I guess it wasrt realistic
to expect Doar Dorm

01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:11.515
to turn into Dior Dorm overnight.

01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:13.153
They wouldn't even open them.

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:16.796
They said without the soap,
the discs wouldn't fly properly.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.470
Are you coming Friday?
Violet's launching her dance craze.

01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:22.033
Oh, really? That's great.

01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:24.117
What's the dance?
The Sambola.

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:25.594
The devil's dance.

01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:29.315
Oh, cool. We'll go, right?
Yes, I'd like to.

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:33.752
But I have several papers to finish.
But I'd like to.

01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:54.314
Great. Thanks, Gus.

01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:58.877
I don't see how we're going to start
a dance craze if no guys show up.

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:01.999
Most guys aren't very good
with the dance-craze thing.

01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:05.112
Very good news. I was just
in my procrastination seminar

01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:08.278
and the two guys
from Doar Dorm had showered.

01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:11.517
It was clear they'd used soap.
Oh, my gosh, what a difference.

01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:15.633
Seems they'd been throwing packages
so energetically, a soap bar fell out.

01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:18.308
The unfamiliar ivory-like object
intrigued them

01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:20.829
and one thing
led to another, and, well...

01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:23.076
It was just as you said.
Isn't that great?

01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:26.192
Oh, look, here's Jimbo.
Jimbo doesn't count.

01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:29.758
Where is everybody?

01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:41.038
Arert we gonna be late
for Violet's dance craze?

01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:42.275
You wanna go to that?

01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:44.114
Yeah.

01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:47.357
You're kidding.
No, I love dance crazes.

01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:49.874
Gosh, you're strange.

01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:52.238
But aren't we already late?

01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:54.510
No, it's later on. Like 10, I think.

01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:58.996
I have to confess, I've started
losing patience with Violet.

01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:02.158
Depression calls
for serious treatment.

01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:05.193
Medication.
Psychopharmaceuticals.

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:06.674
Talk therapy.

01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:10.316
Are those approaches effective?
Despite the medication and therapy,

01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:14.559
Ed School students are still throwing
themselves off Robertson Hall.

01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:17.399
Violet's ideas
might seem a little offbeat...

01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:21.593
A little? Oh, my God. I don't know
how much you know about Violet,

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:23.836
but there's some
pretty weird stuff.

01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:25.917
You know, Violet. Violet Wister.

01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:27.712
It's not even her real name.

01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:30.070
It isn't?
No, it's Emily Tweeter.

01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:33.114
When she was 11,
she went completely crazy

01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:35.788
and has had several
relapses since.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.391
So it's a little worrisome to have her
counsel nearly suicidal individuals.

01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:42.318
I can't believe it.

01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:45.159
What?
Emily Tweeter.

01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:48.636
In first grade, I had an enormous crush
on a girl with that name.

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:51.875
And you remember that?
Yeah.

01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:54.997
<i>Pretty huge Dr. Zhivago stuff.</i>

01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:58.112
Any idea or even mention of her
filled me with emotion.

01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:00.311
I had a strange perspective
on the world.

01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:02.988
I don't think my brain
was functioning properly.

01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:05.316
Everything was a bit of a dream.

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:07.673
You think this was Violet?

01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:10.792
You have any idea if Violet
attended Willamette Montessori?

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.592
In Portland?

01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:14.075
We didn't order these.

01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:16.748
Compliments of the guy at the bar.

01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:29.433
It was so brutal
how it ended between us.

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:32.470
I know I was too angry
and a bit crazy,

01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:35.752
but I thought that what we had
was stronger than that.

01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:39.350
That you would not just walk away
after one disagreement.

01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:42.158
It wasrt just that.

01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:45.750
Oh. You mean my Cathar beliefs.

01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:48.468
Well, ahem,

01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:53.478
I am no longer a Cathar.

01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:55.715
How is that possible?

01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:58.430
It's been very difficult.

01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:01.474
You've dropped your adherence
to the Cathar faith?

01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:04.478
Yes, I have.
Good. Heh-heh.

01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:09.276
Normally I'd be reluctant to comment
on anyone's religion, but...

01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:10.879
What?

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:14.672
I'm sorry. I guess...
I guess I'm a bit of a bigot. I just...

01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:18.953
I could never take seriously any
religion that worships on Tuesdays.

01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:23.194
Major religions require worship on the
weekend. Friday, Saturday or Sunday.

01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:25.470
I find it just really laudatory

01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:28.717
that people sacrifice
their weekend time to worship God.

01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:35.431
Having the Sabbath on Tuesday
always seemed very bizarre to me.

01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:37.917
It's not right.

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:40.953
You know what?
We'd better get to the Lone Star.

01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:43.756
Why are you so concerned
about that?

01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:47.714
Well, it's not as if international
dance crazes start every day.

01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:53.438
We'd better hurry.

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:03.073
What's wrong?

01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:05.350
Another fiasco.

01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:12.314
Sometimes our struggle reminds me
of the myth of Sisyphus.

01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:14.192
Who?
The myth about the guy

01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:17.597
who pushes an enormous rock
only to have it keep rolling back.

01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:19.711
Oh, yeah. What a knucklehead.

01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:22.718
The important thing to remember
is that he was mythical.

01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:25.115
He never really existed.

01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:28.759
Violet? Did you spend any part
of your education

01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:30.871
at Willamette Montessori?

01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:32.308
In Oregon?

01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:34.313
Why?

01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:38.759
Sound like "tweaker. "

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:41.758
Would you say today is very grey?

01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:43.837
I'd say so. Maybe blue-grey.

01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:47.674
Yeah, no, that rings a bell now.

01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:50.793
Bye.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.231
I'm sorry. Her name wasrt
Emily Tweeter, but Lucy Wurlitzer.

01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:57.910
They're not similar. I'm beginning
to realise that the human memory

01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:01.112
is not the foolproof instrument
we sometimes imagine.

01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:05.154
What's worse, everyone knew about
my obsession, including my parents,

01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:07.510
those from whom
I most wanted it kept.

01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:12.669
So from your earliest years, you were
already a playboy or operator type?

01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:15.713
Yes. I suppose that's why secrecy
seemed so desirable.

01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:20.196
Violet, can we talk?

01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:28.715
What's the plural of doofus?
Doufi.

01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:30.399
Not doofuses?

01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:31.953
You can say either.

01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:34.594
"Doufi" respects the Latin root
and is preferred.

01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:38.349
"Doofuses" is also correct,
although a bit inelegant.

01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:40.437
You've thought a lot about this.
Yes, I've had to.

01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:44.394
Mm.
Why? What is it?

01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:50.513
I like Fred, he's a nice guy.
And I can see why you like him.

01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:54.710
When I first met you and Rose,
I thought you were the cool crowd.

01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:58.595
And in many ways you are. I find your
perfume and fashion sense excellent.

01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:00.199
Thank you.

01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:02.072
But there's a reason, I think,

01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:07.479
why you are
so strongly attracted to...

01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:09.553
doufi.

01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:12.797
And it's not an accident
how different groups divide up.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:14.069
Isn't that a rainbow?

01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:15.998
That's a rainbow!
Thor.

01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:18.873
No, Thor! Thor, no! Stop!

01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:21.591
Please, stop!

01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:28.749
He's headed for Robertson Hall!

01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:40.918
Red. Orange.

01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:44.430
Yellow. Green. Blue. Indigo.

01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:48.550
Hallelujah! Lord God, thank you.

01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:52.431
Education. Education.

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:55.359
We can learn the subjects
we set out to master,

01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:59.189
no matter how hard
or impossible they may seem.

01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:00.992
Thank you.

01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:04.237
Thank you.
I wasrt sure I was gonna make it.

01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:06.555
Magenta.

01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:11.072
Pink. Gold.

01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:17.112
I miss my nice American friend.

01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:18.878
No, you're mistaken.

01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:22.231
You go to London for four weeks?
Six.

01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:26.348
It's dangerous,
parents letting children travel.

01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:30.075
They send them off and they don't
know what they'll be getting back.

01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:32.955
I don't know what you're referring to.

01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:35.552
You're not from London.

01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:40.236
I'm from London.
I was there, now I'm here.

01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:41.714
I'm from London.

01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:44.117
I just miss my nice American friend.

01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:46.435
Nice?

01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:49.916
Nice? Fine. I'm fine.

01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:53.469
Those are not adjectives
I like to use.

01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:56.831
God gave us abilities.
He requires that we use them.

01:26:57.040 --> 01:27:01.113
Good, better, best,
excelsior, higher.

01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:03.835
Only excellence
can glorify the Lord.

01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:06.349
Vulgarity is, in essence,
blasphemous.

01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:13.550
I'm sorry
for what I was saying before.

01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:15.830
Of course you're not linked
to the doufi,

01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:18.395
or even
that such distinctions are valid.

01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:23.879
No, don't apologise.
I probably do have a doufi orientation.

01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:28.958
But behind coolness,
isn't there a certain repressing,

01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:32.948
squashing down, or lack
of cultivation of one's humanity?

01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:37.756
Oh, so you think that cool people
have less humanity?

01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:40.758
No, I don't think cool people
are entirely inuman.

01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:43.110
Just enough to be cool.

01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:45.950
In our society,
there's all this propaganda,

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:49.596
in favour of uniqueness,
eccentricity, et cetera.

01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:54.510
But does the world really want
or need more of such traits?

01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:58.430
Arert such people
usually terrible pains in the neck?

01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:00.916
What the world needs
to work properly

01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:04.317
is a large mass of normal people.

01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:06.511
I would like to be one of those.

01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:08.199
Sorry.

01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:11.190
But you'll still do the part?

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:14.472
Yeah, of course.

01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:23.438
So do you know every number

01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:27.189
in every Fred Astaire movie?
There were two in our school musical.

01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:29.914
I know those.
Did performing those two numbers

01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:33.999
help you overcome feelings
of discouragement and despair?

01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:35.872
Absolutely.

01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:38.193
Freak.

01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:41.915
# If I should suddenly start to sing #

01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:44.475
# Or stand on my head
Or anything #

01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:46.910
# Don't think that
I've lost my senses #

01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:51.830
# It's just that my happiness
Finally commences #

01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:54.315
# The long, long ages
Of dark despair #

01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:57.080
# Are turning into thin air #

01:28:57.280 --> 01:28:59.510
# And it seems
that suddenly I've #

01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:04.157
# Become the happiest man alive #

01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:07.670
# Things are looking up #

01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:11.190
# I've been looking
The landscape over #

01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:14.551
# And it's covered
With four-leaf clover #

01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:20.790
# Oh, things are looking up
Since love looked up at me #

01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:24.553
# Bitter was my cup #

01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:28.116
# But no more
Will I be the mourner #

01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:31.312
# For I've certainly
Turned the corner #

01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:36.992
# Oh, things are looking up
Since love looked up at me #

01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:42.070
# See the sunbeams
Every one beams #

01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:46.876
# Just because of you
Love's in session #

01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:51.676
# And my depression
Is unmistakably through #

01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:54.440
# Things are looking up #

01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:57.757
# It's a great little world we live in #

01:29:57.960 --> 01:30:03.717
# Oh, I'm happy as a pup
Since love looked up at us #

01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:25.073
# Things are looking up #

01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:28.636
# I've been looking
The landscape over #

01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:31.991
# And it's covered
With four-leaf clover #

01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:38.070
# Oh things are looking up
Since love looked up at me #

01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:20.478
Hey, everybody,
let's do the Sambola.

01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:33.550
<i># They love sambola now #</i>

01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:35.671

01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:48.631
<i># When a boy wants a girl
In his arms #</i>

01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:51.638
<i># This is the dance
He should dance with her #</i>

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:54.229
<i># 'Cause nothing

01:31:54.440 --> 01:31:56.476

She can win his heart #</i>

Do the sambola #</i>
