00:00.224 --> 00:01.558
<i>Previously on "Heartland":</i>

00:01.626 --> 00:03.694
I just wanna spend
some time with you.

00:03.761 --> 00:05.562
You're amazing.

00:06.830 --> 00:07.997
I don't mess around
with married men, cowboy.

00:08.064 --> 00:09.800
Get it straight.

00:09.867 --> 00:11.201
I think I'm in love.

00:11.268 --> 00:13.470
Martin, I can't go back
to New York.

00:13.538 --> 00:14.637
I'm not asking you to.

00:14.705 --> 00:16.572
We've taken over
a firm in Calgary

00:16.640 --> 00:18.708
and I want you
on our team.

00:18.775 --> 00:19.975
The reason that Lightning
is refusing

00:20.043 --> 00:21.243
is because someone
was shocking him

00:21.311 --> 00:22.812
to get him out
of the gate faster.

00:22.879 --> 00:24.613
Are you accusing me?

00:24.681 --> 00:27.950
Here is to our new house
and your new job.

00:30.820 --> 00:32.587
Show these people
your true colours, man!

00:32.655 --> 00:33.588
Hit me!

00:33.656 --> 00:34.989
You all right?

00:35.057 --> 00:37.826
I just got off the phone
with the registrar

00:37.893 --> 00:40.362
and I know who paid
my tuition.

00:40.429 --> 00:42.129
It was Wade.

00:42.197 --> 00:43.365
Your stepdad.

00:44.299 --> 00:45.500
Don't call him that.

01:10.892 --> 01:12.092
You sure about this?

01:12.159 --> 01:13.059
Well, the guy said
they were in the coulee,

01:13.127 --> 01:14.394
just past the turnoff.

01:14.461 --> 01:17.197
It's not exactly
horse country.

01:35.680 --> 01:37.348
Oh my God.

01:44.890 --> 01:47.258
<i>Amy, this one's in
a real bad way.</i>

01:47.326 --> 01:48.692
<i>He's barely breathing.</i>

01:48.760 --> 01:49.860
This one's got
some kind of infection

01:49.929 --> 01:51.929
all over his neck.

01:51.996 --> 01:53.397
He's really sunken in,
and I don't know,

01:53.464 --> 01:54.464
he doesn't look like
he's in good shape,

01:54.532 --> 01:56.466
but I think
he's a thoroughbred.

01:56.534 --> 01:57.600
this guy too.

01:57.668 --> 01:59.403
He's got a tattoo
in his lip.

01:59.470 --> 02:01.204
It's from the track.

02:02.873 --> 02:05.142
Let's see if I can get this guy
up to the trailer.

02:07.744 --> 02:09.078
Scott, it's Amy.

02:09.145 --> 02:10.312
We've got a problem here.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.315
Can you call me back
as soon as possible?

02:12.382 --> 02:13.515
Thanks.

02:40.741 --> 02:42.142
Hey, Wade.

02:43.511 --> 02:44.578
Ty!

02:45.613 --> 02:46.947
Holy cow.

02:48.850 --> 02:49.883
I got your message.

02:49.951 --> 02:51.285
Message?

02:51.353 --> 02:52.386
You give someone
a couple thousand dollars,

02:52.454 --> 02:53.820
you're sending them
a message.

02:53.888 --> 02:56.422
No, I mean, I never really
thought of it that way.

02:56.490 --> 02:58.358
But, you know,
you're going to school now,

02:58.425 --> 03:00.526
I figured you could
use the money.

03:00.594 --> 03:03.363
It's a goodwill gesture
from me to you.

03:03.430 --> 03:04.930
The only problem is
I don't want your money.

03:04.999 --> 03:07.833
Whoa! Come on.
It's a gift.

03:07.901 --> 03:09.902
It's your tuition,
your future.

03:09.970 --> 03:11.636
My future doesn't
have you in it.

03:13.072 --> 03:14.139
Wow.

03:15.808 --> 03:17.809
Ty! Come on, man.

03:22.148 --> 03:24.282
You're gonna need this.

03:25.218 --> 03:28.352
Just trying to do you
a favour.

03:34.592 --> 03:36.060
You're in Red Deer?

03:36.128 --> 03:37.495
How long do you think
it's gonna take to get here?

03:38.430 --> 03:40.364
Well, the one is standing,

03:40.432 --> 03:41.765
but he's in really rough shape

03:41.833 --> 03:43.933
and we've got to get him
to your clinic, Scott.

03:44.001 --> 03:45.535
The other,
he's-he's laying down,

03:45.602 --> 03:46.736
and he's not doing well.

03:46.803 --> 03:48.104
His breathing
is really shallow.

03:49.706 --> 03:51.041
Caleb!

03:51.708 --> 03:53.676
There wasn't anything else
we could do, Amy.

03:57.681 --> 04:01.016
Couldn't just let him
lie there like that.

04:01.084 --> 04:02.351
Let's get a move on,

04:02.419 --> 04:03.785
before it's too late
for the other one.

<i>So tell me, Tim,</i>

04:57.937 --> 04:59.505

"Maiden Race"?</i>

04:59.573 --> 05:00.906
Uh, well...

05:00.907 --> 05:03.475
None of these horses have
ever won a race before.

05:03.976 --> 05:04.742
Wait a minute...

05:04.743 --> 05:08.079
You're telling me that Cisco's running
his first race against a bunch of losers?

05:08.349 --> 05:09.182
No, no, no.
He's up against

05:09.183 --> 05:11.350
some of the best two-year-olds
in the country.

05:11.418 --> 05:13.284
But do you really think
he has a chance?

05:13.285 --> 05:15.086
A chance?
He's gonna win it.

05:15.154 --> 05:16.221
Come on, really?

05:16.288 --> 05:17.788
Yeah, we gotta stay
positive.

05:17.856 --> 05:19.289
We're Team Cisco.

05:19.357 --> 05:21.225
That makes you
the Cisco Kid.

05:21.292 --> 05:22.526
Hey, Tim.

05:22.594 --> 05:23.960
Hey, Janice.

05:26.231 --> 05:28.732
What the hell
are you doing here?

05:28.799 --> 05:30.534
Do I know you?

05:31.469 --> 05:34.804
Yeah.
You stole Lightning Dexter.

05:35.739 --> 05:38.307
Lightning Dexter?
Uh...

05:38.375 --> 05:40.276
I don't know
what you're talking about.

05:43.580 --> 05:45.615
Uh, yeah, neither do I.

05:45.682 --> 05:48.151
Tim, what's going on?

05:48.218 --> 05:50.019
<i>No...</i>

05:50.086 --> 05:51.353
Nothing. Nothing.

05:51.420 --> 05:54.422
I just, I thought I recognized
that guy.

05:56.759 --> 05:59.927
What Caleb did was
the right thing to do,

05:59.995 --> 06:03.131
but I just can't stop
thinking about it.

06:04.066 --> 06:07.701
I mean, who knows how long
that poor horse had been lying there.

06:07.769 --> 06:09.336
How's the other one
doing?

06:09.404 --> 06:12.373
He's weak and dehydrated,

06:12.440 --> 06:14.908
but Scott says
he thinks he has a chance.

06:14.976 --> 06:17.044
That's good.
Yeah?

06:18.413 --> 06:19.346
Here's your bill.

06:19.414 --> 06:20.481
Thank you.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.552
Um, Amy, do you mind
if you...

06:25.619 --> 06:26.986
Can you grab this?

06:27.054 --> 06:29.522
I'm just having a bit of a
cashflow problem right now, so...

06:31.124 --> 06:33.493
You did it then?

06:33.561 --> 06:35.361
Yeah, I borrowed
the money from Scott

06:35.429 --> 06:37.397
and I went to see him
this morning.

06:37.464 --> 06:40.465
Wow.
That must've been weird.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.502
Did he say anything?

06:43.570 --> 06:44.903
Nothing much.

06:44.970 --> 06:47.339
I didn't really give him
a chance to, so...

06:47.407 --> 06:49.174
Well, this is definitely
on me.

06:49.242 --> 06:52.077
A celebration,
you can call it.

06:52.144 --> 06:54.546
Ty, you didn't punch him out,
did you?

06:57.782 --> 06:58.849
Okay.

07:01.587 --> 07:03.688
Okay, so what was that about?

07:03.755 --> 07:06.857
The guy's name is Liam,
he used to work for Lisa.

07:06.925 --> 07:11.328
He caught him using
one of those zappers on Dexter.

07:11.395 --> 07:13.597
So he's your best friend now,
or...?

07:13.664 --> 07:15.398
Come on, Tim.

07:15.466 --> 07:17.467
He's just somebody
who works at the track,

07:17.535 --> 07:19.135
as a groom,
for another owner.

07:19.203 --> 07:20.670
So it's really not
your problem.

07:20.738 --> 07:22.038
Well,
I don't trust him.

07:22.106 --> 07:23.373
Hey, take a look around
this place.

07:23.441 --> 07:26.109
Everybody breaks a rule
every now and then.

07:26.176 --> 07:27.343
If you hold that
against them,

07:27.410 --> 07:30.512
you're not gonna have anyone
left to ride your horses.

07:30.580 --> 07:32.114
Oh, good to know.

07:39.456 --> 07:42.090
Hey! Hey! Look at you!
Wow, you look...

07:42.158 --> 07:43.458
Confident? Professional?

07:43.525 --> 07:45.059
Stylishly business casual?

07:45.127 --> 07:46.794
Yeah, and that drool
on your shirt

07:46.862 --> 07:47.795
really sells the look too.

07:47.863 --> 07:48.929
Oh my God!

07:50.366 --> 07:51.866
Honey,
what am I doing?

07:51.933 --> 07:53.100
Maybe this was all
a mistake.

07:53.168 --> 07:54.835
I mean, my baby's
still a baby.

07:54.903 --> 07:56.170
She needs me!

07:56.238 --> 07:58.306
She'll be fine, honey.
She has her father,

07:58.374 --> 08:00.039
her great grandfather,
her aunt,

08:00.107 --> 08:01.908
and, you know,
Mallory, in a pinch.

08:01.976 --> 08:04.010
So what're you saying,
she won't even miss me?

08:04.078 --> 08:06.546
The fragile bonds between mother
and child will be broken

08:06.614 --> 08:07.714
and in a few years

08:07.782 --> 08:09.816
she'll be caught shoplifting
makeup at some strip mall

08:09.884 --> 08:11.285
and it'll be all my fault?

08:11.352 --> 08:13.019
Lots of mothers juggle kids
and their careers, honey.

08:13.087 --> 08:14.854
It'll be fine.

08:14.922 --> 08:17.055
I'm gonna miss
all those magic moments.

08:17.123 --> 08:18.324
She'll be walking
and talking

08:18.392 --> 08:20.326
and I won't even be there
to see it.

08:20.394 --> 08:22.528
Go! You have to go. Now!

08:22.596 --> 08:23.896
First day of work,
you don't wanna be late.

08:23.963 --> 08:25.364
- Okay.
- Bye.

08:27.133 --> 08:28.267
Don't worry,
if anything important happens,

08:28.335 --> 08:29.368
it'll be thoroughly
documented.

08:29.436 --> 08:30.803
Great.

08:30.870 --> 08:32.102
I can watch her growing up
on my smart phone.

08:32.171 --> 08:33.471
Get outta here.

08:42.047 --> 08:44.515
Da-da-da-da...

08:44.582 --> 08:47.584
What?
What did you say Katie?

08:49.688 --> 08:50.721
Da-da.

08:50.789 --> 08:52.957
Yes! That's me.
I'm your da-da.

08:53.025 --> 08:55.193
Yeah! Da-da.
Good girl!

08:56.128 --> 08:58.962
Yeah! You're the smartest
little baby Kitty Kat.

08:59.030 --> 09:00.096
Da-da! Yeah!

09:01.032 --> 09:02.699
Jack,
did you hear that?

09:02.766 --> 09:05.969
All I'm hearing is a
grown man talking baby talk.

09:06.037 --> 09:07.103
No, but, I mean,
she just said...

09:07.171 --> 09:08.171
You didn't hear?
She just...

09:08.239 --> 09:09.306
Just what?

09:13.643 --> 09:16.245
She just... she burped
and it sounded like...

09:18.381 --> 09:20.115
Yeah,
it was a gassy baby!

09:20.183 --> 09:21.283
Oh...

09:24.487 --> 09:26.288
But...

09:26.356 --> 09:27.556
What did you say?

09:29.725 --> 09:30.925
Yeah. What I don't get,

09:30.993 --> 09:32.060
is if you want to get rid
of a horse,

09:32.127 --> 09:33.862
why would you dump it
in a coulee?

09:33.929 --> 09:36.998
Well, owning a racehorse
can an expensive proposition,

09:38.200 --> 09:39.901
especially
if they're injured.

09:39.969 --> 09:42.136
Even costs a pile of
money to have 'em put down.

09:42.204 --> 09:43.704
Some people take
the easy way out.

09:44.639 --> 09:45.472
I can't believe
they let that guy

09:45.539 --> 09:47.241
back on the track.

09:47.308 --> 09:48.976
Neither can I. Hey! Hey!

09:50.144 --> 09:52.980
My horse goes
in the front stall.

09:53.047 --> 09:54.714
What difference does it make?

09:54.782 --> 09:55.949
'Cause I want him to know

09:56.017 --> 09:57.284
he's always first
out of the gate!

10:00.954 --> 10:02.654
All right.
Here you go.

10:16.469 --> 10:19.637
You know, I kind of wish I could
ride in the trailer with him.

10:19.705 --> 10:21.973
Yeah,
I know what you mean.

10:22.041 --> 10:23.174
Well,
we're gonna leave

10:23.242 --> 10:24.876
first thing
tomorrow morning.

10:24.944 --> 10:26.912
A road trip?
Oh, sweet!

10:26.979 --> 10:28.013
What do you think?

10:28.080 --> 10:30.081
Team Cisco,
on the road.

10:30.149 --> 10:31.549
All right!

10:38.723 --> 10:40.090
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:40.758 --> 10:42.192
I'm just gonna have
the ranchman's special,

10:42.260 --> 10:43.660
with bacon and sausage.

10:43.728 --> 10:45.262
<i>- Mm-hm.</i>
<i>- Thanks.</i>

10:54.338 --> 10:55.405
Huh.

10:57.341 --> 10:58.374
Hey.

10:58.442 --> 10:59.508
Hi.

11:00.377 --> 11:01.877
Is this seat taken?

11:01.946 --> 11:02.745
What? You didn't you
get the message

11:02.813 --> 11:04.414
when I decked you?

11:04.481 --> 11:08.650
I'm a rodeo cowboy.
I mean, one little punch?

11:08.717 --> 11:12.120
Look, where I come from,
it's more of a come on.

11:12.188 --> 11:13.288
Really?

11:13.356 --> 11:14.556
Well, where I come from,

11:14.623 --> 11:16.658
rodeo cowboys don't really
impress me much.

11:16.725 --> 11:19.494
Especially married ones.

11:19.562 --> 11:21.262
Fair enough.

11:21.330 --> 11:23.130
I'll see you around.

11:26.701 --> 11:27.969
Okay...

11:37.111 --> 11:38.244
Hey, Ty.

11:42.316 --> 11:43.649
You sure know how
to keep a guy waiting.

11:46.120 --> 11:47.620
What're you doing here?

11:47.688 --> 11:49.089
Felt bad about
our last meeting.

11:49.156 --> 11:52.658
I thought...
Maybe we could try again.

11:52.726 --> 11:54.226
Well,
you can forget it.

11:54.294 --> 11:57.662
Ty, I know I can't take back
the time you did in juvie.

11:57.730 --> 11:59.999
You're right,
you can't.

12:00.066 --> 12:01.033
I'm proud of the way
you've put your life

12:01.101 --> 12:02.868
back together though,

12:02.935 --> 12:04.669
and I thought maybe
by paying your tuition

12:04.737 --> 12:07.839
we could just balance the bad
with some good.

12:07.907 --> 12:09.440
What do you say?

12:09.508 --> 12:10.541
Come on, I know you could
use the help.

12:10.609 --> 12:12.243
Take this back.

12:12.311 --> 12:13.911
Don't you get it?

12:13.979 --> 12:15.546
I don't want your money,
I don't need your money,

12:15.614 --> 12:17.915
and I don't wanna
see you around here!

12:17.983 --> 12:20.918
Ty, I come here
with the best of intentions.

12:20.986 --> 12:22.220
Look, don't make a decision
you're gonna regret--

12:22.287 --> 12:23.954
Don't talk, okay?

12:24.023 --> 12:26.723
Get in your car
and get outta here, now.

12:26.790 --> 12:28.358
Okay. I get it.

12:31.029 --> 12:34.064
After you've had a chance to
think about this a little bit longer,

12:34.999 --> 12:37.634
you give me a call,
okay?

12:37.701 --> 12:39.036
That's not gonna happen,
Wade.

12:42.339 --> 12:44.606
That's what I like
about you, Ty?

12:44.674 --> 12:47.176
When you got yourself
a little problem,

12:47.244 --> 12:49.445
you don't act
like a weasel,

12:49.513 --> 12:51.113
complain to other people.

12:51.181 --> 12:53.049
You deal with it man-to-man,
straight ahead.

12:53.116 --> 12:54.883
You go for it,
I like that.

12:56.053 --> 12:57.885
Kind of like me.

13:11.600 --> 13:14.234
We're gonna get some cheese...

13:14.302 --> 13:16.136
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:16.204 --> 13:17.404
There's mommy.

13:18.639 --> 13:20.507
Can you say "mama"?

13:20.575 --> 13:22.809
So, first day, big firm,
how did it go?

13:22.877 --> 13:23.910
Well,
they must like me.

13:23.978 --> 13:25.546
I got an office
with a door.

13:25.613 --> 13:27.247
How's my baby?

13:27.315 --> 13:28.482
Office with a door
no less.

13:28.550 --> 13:29.615
And a window...

13:29.683 --> 13:30.983
Wow.

13:31.051 --> 13:32.385
<i>Yeah. I barely got settled in</i>

13:32.453 --> 13:33.953
and they hauled me
into some big pitch meeting.

13:34.020 --> 13:35.354
A pitch meeting?

13:35.422 --> 13:36.822
Yeah. I mean, it was mostly
just to meet the team.

13:36.890 --> 13:38.724
Oh, mostly?

13:38.792 --> 13:40.093
I mention this little problem
with the evaluation to Martin,

13:40.160 --> 13:42.128
and suddenly he's all interested
in my opinions

13:42.196 --> 13:43.896
on just about everything.

13:43.964 --> 13:45.363
Oh!

13:45.431 --> 13:46.898
She's giving her boss advice
on the first day,

13:46.966 --> 13:48.066
can you believe that?

13:48.134 --> 13:50.168
Listen, Peter,
it was really nothing.

13:50.236 --> 13:53.738
More importantly,
how's my little baby girl?

13:53.806 --> 13:55.707
Hi! You miss mommy?

13:55.774 --> 13:58.577
Did you have lots
and lots to say?

13:58.644 --> 14:00.345
Uh, no.
No, not a peep.

14:00.413 --> 14:03.114
You didn't miss a thing.

14:03.181 --> 14:04.781
So how's that house
of yours coming along?

14:04.849 --> 14:06.984
Uh, we're working on it, dad.

14:07.051 --> 14:09.220
The problem is
we had a contractor,

14:09.287 --> 14:11.288
but he forgot to mention
he was never going to show up.

14:12.690 --> 14:16.860
Yeah. So I'm thinking
about doing the job myself.

14:16.928 --> 14:18.194
You are?

14:18.262 --> 14:19.262
<i>Yeah. It's clear the lot,</i>

14:19.330 --> 14:22.098
I rent a backhoe,
stake the property.

14:22.166 --> 14:23.266
I was gonna ask you,
Jack,

14:23.334 --> 14:25.435
if you mind if I borrow Caleb
to give me a hand?

14:25.503 --> 14:27.237
Well, he doesn't do much
around here,

14:27.304 --> 14:29.071
so be my guest.

14:29.140 --> 14:31.073
Lou, these burritos
are fantastic.

14:31.142 --> 14:32.408
Do you have any more?

14:32.476 --> 14:33.642
I started my new job today, Dad.

14:33.709 --> 14:35.244
Peter made them.

14:35.311 --> 14:36.645
<i>And you just had the last one.</i>

14:36.712 --> 14:38.980
We weren't expecting
company again.

14:39.048 --> 14:40.715
You change diapers,
dig foundations,

14:40.783 --> 14:43.252
<i>and cook Mexican?</i>

14:43.319 --> 14:44.753
That's uh...

14:45.688 --> 14:47.122
That's really something.
I gotta take this.

14:47.190 --> 14:48.257
'Scuse me.

14:51.360 --> 14:54.395
What?!
No, I...

14:56.465 --> 14:58.199
No, I'm on it!
I'm on it!

14:58.267 --> 14:59.467
What happened?

14:59.535 --> 15:01.302
That was the barn manager
from Northlands.

15:01.370 --> 15:02.703
A problem with the horses--

15:03.639 --> 15:04.672
They didn't arrive.

15:04.739 --> 15:05.672
Was there an accident?

15:05.739 --> 15:06.806
Well, is Cisco okay?

15:06.874 --> 15:08.074
I don't know.
I don't know.

15:08.142 --> 15:10.510
I gotta...
I gotta go down to the track.

15:10.578 --> 15:11.578
Well, can I come?

15:11.646 --> 15:13.580
No. You stay here!

15:13.648 --> 15:15.248
He'll call you
when he knows something.

15:18.553 --> 15:20.253
- Hijacked?
- Oh my God.

15:20.321 --> 15:21.453
Yeah, the driver of the rig,

15:21.521 --> 15:23.121
a Ralph Merchant,
age forty-five,

15:23.190 --> 15:25.391
he stopped for a honey crueller
and a double double

15:25.458 --> 15:26.392
near the junction
of highway two

15:26.459 --> 15:27.660
and highway eleven.

15:27.727 --> 15:29.094
When he came back outside,

15:29.162 --> 15:30.629
truck and trailer were gone,
along with the horses.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.030
Yeah, he left the
keys in the ignition,

15:32.098 --> 15:33.332
the engine running,

15:33.400 --> 15:34.400
and waited for
his partners in crime.

15:34.467 --> 15:35.401
The Red Deer police
questioned him.

15:35.468 --> 15:36.768
His story checks out.

15:36.836 --> 15:38.670
What, "I'm sorry, officer,
it wasn't me"?

15:38.737 --> 15:41.506
He's been a Paladin employee
for over seven years.

15:41.574 --> 15:43.208
I mean, as far as we can tell,
he's just an innocent victim.

15:43.275 --> 15:44.542
I'm the innocent victim, Murphy!

15:44.610 --> 15:46.311
Shut up, Tim.
Let him talk.

15:46.378 --> 15:49.046
A local rancher found the truck
abandoned on his property.

15:49.114 --> 15:50.548
What about the horses?

15:50.616 --> 15:53.417
Unfortunately,
they were already gone.

15:53.484 --> 15:54.651
That's it?

15:55.587 --> 15:56.720
For the moment.

15:56.787 --> 15:58.054
Wait a second.

15:58.122 --> 15:59.122
They were only interested
in the horses

15:59.190 --> 16:00.290
and not the rig?

16:00.358 --> 16:01.258
Don't worry,

16:01.326 --> 16:02.859
I'll keep you apprised
of any developments in the case.

16:02.927 --> 16:04.027
Oh, good.
Good, Murphy.

16:04.095 --> 16:05.329
Yeah,
keep me apprised.

16:05.396 --> 16:06.463
As long as I'm apprised

16:06.531 --> 16:09.599
I know everything's
gonna be fine.

16:17.708 --> 16:18.974
Your dad's horse?

16:19.042 --> 16:21.076
Yeah, and three others.

16:21.144 --> 16:22.978
All going to Northlands?

16:23.046 --> 16:25.747
Yeah. The thing that's crazy
is that they're racehorses.

16:25.814 --> 16:27.181
They're tattooed,
registered,

16:27.250 --> 16:28.816
they're easy to trace.

16:28.884 --> 16:30.552
You can't sell them,
you can't race them.

16:30.620 --> 16:31.919
Why would anyone
steal them?

16:31.987 --> 16:33.355
The trailer - what was
the trucking company used?

16:33.422 --> 16:34.856
Uh, Paladin.

16:34.923 --> 16:36.725
Everybody at the track
uses them.

16:36.792 --> 16:38.159
I don't know if this
is a coincidence or not,

16:38.227 --> 16:39.628
but the horses that
Caleb and I found

16:39.695 --> 16:42.263
were racehorses as well.

16:44.799 --> 16:46.933
Paladin Transport.
Wade Dalton.

16:47.001 --> 16:48.435
Yeah.
Wade works for them.

16:48.503 --> 16:50.203
Do you think he had
something to do with this?

16:50.272 --> 16:51.838
I don't know.

16:51.906 --> 16:53.607
I wouldn't put it
past him.

16:53.675 --> 16:55.008
But he was standing
right there talking to me

16:55.076 --> 16:57.043
when the horses
were on the road.

17:08.054 --> 17:09.689
Have they found Cisco yet?

17:09.757 --> 17:12.325
Nope,
not as far as I know.

17:12.393 --> 17:13.358
Your dad promised
to call me

17:13.425 --> 17:15.926
if there was any news.

17:15.994 --> 17:17.396
How are you doing?

17:17.463 --> 17:19.196
Okay, I guess.

17:20.232 --> 17:22.834
I just wish I could do
something to help.

17:22.902 --> 17:24.102
Yeah, your dad,

17:24.170 --> 17:26.738
he's not too good at dealing
with this sort of thing, so...

17:26.806 --> 17:28.272
Best stay out of his way.

17:28.340 --> 17:30.941
Don't add fuel
to the fire.

17:31.009 --> 17:33.544
<i>Maybe try understanding
what he is going through.</i>

17:33.612 --> 17:36.415
So, what, I'm supposed
to be the grown-up?

17:37.783 --> 17:39.216
Well, when it comes
to your father,

17:39.284 --> 17:41.652
yeah, that's a good way
of putting it.

17:52.843 --> 17:54.076
You know, building
a house is something

17:54.144 --> 17:56.311
I always thought I'd do
with Ashley.

17:56.379 --> 17:58.514
Yeah. Sorry to hear about
you guys splitting up.

17:58.582 --> 17:59.715
Yeah.
It's pretty well over.

17:59.783 --> 18:01.884
Mind you,
I'm not a 100% sure.

18:01.952 --> 18:03.986
I mean,
it's not like a horse.

18:04.054 --> 18:04.987
You know when their day
is done.

18:05.055 --> 18:06.422
But marriage?

18:06.489 --> 18:07.822
It's a bit more
complicated, huh?

18:07.890 --> 18:08.823
Tell me about it.

18:08.891 --> 18:10.091
I met this new girl.

18:10.159 --> 18:12.360
She's the exact opposite
of Ashley.

18:12.428 --> 18:14.930
But she's got this thing
about married cowboys;

18:14.997 --> 18:16.097
Won't go near them.

18:16.165 --> 18:18.299
Can you blame her?

18:18.367 --> 18:19.534
Guess not.

18:20.369 --> 18:22.070
Da-da, da-da, da-da...

18:22.137 --> 18:24.137
Uh, Pete?
Did you hear that?

18:24.205 --> 18:25.673
No. No, I didn't.

18:25.740 --> 18:27.041
It's way too early
for her to be talking.

18:27.108 --> 18:28.809
Didn't hear a thing
and neither did you.

18:28.877 --> 18:30.310
<i>I don't know, man.
That was clear as a bell.</i>

18:30.378 --> 18:32.947
<i>She said "da-da."
You said "da-da," didn't you?</i>

18:33.014 --> 18:35.983
Listen.
You know Lou, right?

18:36.051 --> 18:37.150
You know what she's like.

18:37.218 --> 18:38.285
So how do you think
she would react

18:38.352 --> 18:39.452
if she found out Katie
said her first word

18:39.519 --> 18:41.187
while she was at work.

18:41.254 --> 18:42.321
Got ya.

18:42.389 --> 18:43.556
Okay,
I didn't hear a thing.

18:43.624 --> 18:44.557
No worries, brother.

18:44.625 --> 18:45.925
Thanks.

18:47.027 --> 18:50.429
Come on, sweetheart
can you say "mama"?

18:53.968 --> 18:56.334
I'm a little disappointed
in you, Ty.

18:56.402 --> 18:59.137
You actually think I'd rip off
the company that I work for?

19:01.307 --> 19:03.108
This is what I do.

19:03.175 --> 19:05.176
This is how I saved up
to pay your tuition.

19:06.378 --> 19:08.446
You're lying to me,
right to my face.

19:08.514 --> 19:11.248
Really? Is that
what you think?

19:12.183 --> 19:13.884
You think I'm a high-roller
or something?

19:17.923 --> 19:20.024
Won the money
in a horse race?

19:20.092 --> 19:21.125
Where's the faith?

19:21.192 --> 19:22.893
The faith?

19:22.961 --> 19:25.596
One of those stolen horses
belongs to my girlfriend's dad.

19:25.664 --> 19:26.830
Your girlfriend's dad?

19:26.897 --> 19:28.331
- Yeah.
- Really?

19:29.399 --> 19:31.067
Well, that's a little close
to home, isn't it?

19:31.135 --> 19:32.335
I gotta tell you,

19:32.402 --> 19:33.503
I didn't take care
of that shipment,

19:33.570 --> 19:35.939
so I wasn't really
paying attention.

19:36.007 --> 19:37.907
Just give me
a second here.

19:38.843 --> 19:40.944
Okay.
Yeah, here we go.

19:41.012 --> 19:43.679
Cisco.
Tim Fleming, right?

19:45.214 --> 19:47.215
Well, that sucks.

19:48.251 --> 19:50.152
I'll let you know
if I hear anything.

19:50.219 --> 19:51.787
Yeah, right.

19:57.927 --> 20:00.394
Hey, hotshot.
How is it going?

20:02.698 --> 20:04.032
I thought
you might be in town.

20:04.099 --> 20:05.499
Come on, Wade, I'm busy.
I'm working.

20:05.567 --> 20:07.234
No. You're taking
a break

20:07.302 --> 20:10.038
and talking to me
about those horses.

20:10.105 --> 20:11.739
What do you care
about that?

20:11.807 --> 20:13.541
What do I care
about that?!

20:13.608 --> 20:15.709
Tss! Yah!

20:15.777 --> 20:17.410
Come here.
Come here.

20:17.478 --> 20:18.578
Are you an idiot?

20:20.882 --> 20:22.916
I'm working for Paladin.

20:22.984 --> 20:24.350
How do you think
this is gonna look?

20:24.418 --> 20:26.553
It doesn't really have anything
to do with me, Wade.

20:28.956 --> 20:31.456
Where are those horses?

20:31.524 --> 20:32.958
I thought you were
out of it.

20:33.026 --> 20:34.660
Well, I'm not.

20:34.728 --> 20:36.395
<i>Hey!</i>

20:36.462 --> 20:38.698
You boys lose something?

20:38.765 --> 20:40.132
Yeah. Thanks.

20:40.200 --> 20:42.168
Uh, just got away
from my friend.

20:45.739 --> 20:47.005
Where are they?

20:47.073 --> 20:49.207
You're a little late.
They're running tomorrow.

20:49.274 --> 20:50.675
But if you want
some action,

20:50.743 --> 20:52.110
you're more than welcome.

20:52.178 --> 20:53.678
Oh, thanks, Liam.

20:54.613 --> 20:56.547
I don't need your invitation,
all right?

21:07.592 --> 21:09.126
Who is that guy?

21:09.194 --> 21:10.160
You got a pretty
selective memory,

21:10.228 --> 21:11.862
don't you, pal?

21:11.930 --> 21:13.597
The way I heard it,

21:13.664 --> 21:14.497
that's the guy that screwed you
out of winning your first race

21:14.565 --> 21:15.933
<i>with Lightning Dexter.</i>

21:16.000 --> 21:17.467
<i>Wade Dalton.</i>

21:18.402 --> 21:21.971
Guess where he's working now?
Paladin Transport.

21:24.975 --> 21:28.444
Mmm... mushy turkey
and sweet potatoes.

21:28.511 --> 21:29.879
Yum!

21:29.947 --> 21:33.216
It's like Thanksgiving
every day, huh, Katie?

21:33.283 --> 21:35.016
And look!
There's your da-da.

21:35.084 --> 21:36.818
Hi.

21:36.886 --> 21:38.053
Who cares about da-da

21:38.121 --> 21:40.288
when mama is feeding you
your food, right?

21:40.356 --> 21:42.490
<i>Can you say "mama"?</i>

21:42.558 --> 21:43.625
Mama.

21:43.692 --> 21:44.926
Honey,
you're confusing her.

21:44.994 --> 21:49.064
99.9% of babies say
"da-da" first, right?

21:49.132 --> 21:50.732
Oh, really.
How about da-da then?

21:50.799 --> 21:52.399
Can you say da-da?

21:52.467 --> 21:53.600
Da-da. Da-da.

21:54.535 --> 21:56.070
<i>Da-da. Da-da.</i>

21:56.138 --> 21:57.138
Nope.

21:57.205 --> 21:58.672
Well, tomorrow's another day.

21:58.740 --> 22:01.876
You know, Marnie's baby's already
stringing her words together.

22:01.943 --> 22:03.377
Yeah, right.

22:03.444 --> 22:05.579
What, grammatically correct
sentences and everything?

22:05.647 --> 22:07.147
That's crazy.

22:07.214 --> 22:09.182
What? Is it crazy to want
your baby to hit her milestones

22:09.250 --> 22:11.651
a little ahead
of the curve?

22:16.290 --> 22:17.523
Hey, Ty,
I was just at the track.

22:17.591 --> 22:18.624
I ran into
your stepfather.

22:18.692 --> 22:20.794
Didn't realize
he was in town.

22:20.861 --> 22:22.695
Well, neither did I
until a few days ago.

22:22.763 --> 22:24.263
So what's up?
Family reunion?

22:24.330 --> 22:25.630
Oh, come on, Dad.

22:25.698 --> 22:26.498
No. I'm just saying,
if you see him again,

22:26.565 --> 22:27.666
ask him where my horse is.

22:27.733 --> 22:29.968
Okay, Tim, why don't you
lay off, all right?

22:30.036 --> 22:31.003
Thanks.

22:31.070 --> 22:32.337
What's going on here?

22:32.405 --> 22:34.106
Remember that jockey, Liam?

22:34.174 --> 22:35.507
I just ran into him
at the track

22:35.574 --> 22:38.343
with a guy who turns out
to be Ty's stepfather.

22:38.411 --> 22:39.944
- Wade?
- And guess where he works?

22:40.012 --> 22:41.279
Paladin Transport.

22:41.346 --> 22:42.814
Okay, you know what, Tim?!

22:42.881 --> 22:44.515
My mom and him split up
a long time ago,

22:44.582 --> 22:45.883
so he is not my stepfather.

22:45.951 --> 22:46.951
If you have a problem
with him,

22:47.019 --> 22:48.953
you can go to the cops,
not me.

22:49.021 --> 22:50.021
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

22:50.088 --> 22:50.955
Thanks a lot, Dad.

22:51.023 --> 22:52.790
Hey, I'm not the bad guy.

22:53.892 --> 22:57.294
Tim, I know this whole thing
about the horse

22:57.361 --> 22:58.461
is hard on you--

22:58.529 --> 23:01.164
it's not just the horse, Jack.

23:01.232 --> 23:03.066
It's Shane,

23:03.134 --> 23:04.935
he was totally into this.

23:05.002 --> 23:06.669
I was getting somewhere
with the kid.

23:06.737 --> 23:07.838
I understand,

23:07.905 --> 23:09.272
but blaming
your daughter's boyfriend

23:09.340 --> 23:11.240
for an unfortunate choice
his mother made?

23:11.308 --> 23:13.375
That's ridiculous.

23:17.714 --> 23:20.582
Ty, I'm sorry my dad
was such a jerk,

23:20.650 --> 23:21.817
but you gotta understand

23:21.885 --> 23:22.918
he's just worried
about his horse,

23:22.986 --> 23:24.419
and don't take it
personally.

23:28.557 --> 23:31.025
I've got a text
from Scott.

23:32.962 --> 23:33.895
You know that horse
that you and Caleb

23:33.963 --> 23:35.496
brought to the clinic?

23:35.564 --> 23:36.664
He's gonna be all right,

23:36.732 --> 23:38.066
but his suspensory ligaments
are shot.

23:38.133 --> 23:39.767
So his racing days
are over.

23:39.835 --> 23:42.136
And you know those infected
wounds on his neck?

23:42.204 --> 23:43.170
Scott thinks
they were injecting him

23:43.238 --> 23:44.571
with methamphetamines.

23:44.638 --> 23:46.673
To keep him on his feet
as long as possible.

23:46.741 --> 23:48.408
Whoever had those horses,
they just ran them to death?

23:48.476 --> 23:50.143
Then they just dump them
at the side of the road

23:50.211 --> 23:52.679
like they were garbage.

23:53.915 --> 23:57.317
Ty, what if that happens
to Cisco?

24:02.189 --> 24:03.489
So, you know,
I don't expect her

24:03.556 --> 24:04.924
to be reciting
nursery rhymes,

24:04.992 --> 24:06.592
but I figured she'd be
saying an actual word

24:06.659 --> 24:08.794
every once in awhile.

24:09.729 --> 24:12.031
What?
Your baby said that?!

24:12.099 --> 24:14.466
She told you
she loved you?

24:14.534 --> 24:15.901
Wow.
God.

24:15.935 --> 24:17.102
Okay. Yeah.

24:17.169 --> 24:18.203
I really,
I have to go, Marnie.

24:18.271 --> 24:19.404
Bye.

24:19.471 --> 24:20.705
So I guess you heard.

24:20.773 --> 24:22.573
Marnie's baby
is way ahead of Katie.

24:22.641 --> 24:25.243
Oh, God, who cares?
Come on, let's go.

24:25.311 --> 24:26.511
She's a month older, Lou.

24:26.578 --> 24:28.113
I didn't starting talking
until I was two.

24:28.180 --> 24:29.647
Oh, is that supposed
to make me feel better?

24:29.715 --> 24:31.648
I'm just saying all babies
develop at different rates.

24:31.716 --> 24:33.017
Yeah. I was talking
when I was nine-months-old.

24:33.084 --> 24:34.318
Yeah, and you haven't
stopped since.

24:34.386 --> 24:35.319
Ha.

24:35.387 --> 24:36.320
Here. Go.

24:36.388 --> 24:37.321
- Bye.
- Have fun.

24:37.389 --> 24:39.123
Bye, honey.

24:39.190 --> 24:40.490
Can you say "goodbye"
to mama?

24:40.558 --> 24:41.625
Can you say "bye mama"?

24:41.692 --> 24:43.360
Da-da.
No, not da-da.

24:43.428 --> 24:45.062
Mama.
Da-da, da-da...

24:45.130 --> 24:46.863
Not dada!
Mama, you...

24:48.765 --> 24:52.201
I see what you mean;
That is one gassy baby.

25:04.414 --> 25:06.081
Oh, man.

25:06.149 --> 25:07.549
You keep saying
you don't want to see me,

25:07.616 --> 25:10.085
but once again,
here you are.

25:11.186 --> 25:12.753
I just want
some information.

25:12.821 --> 25:14.188
I want to know
what you know.

25:14.256 --> 25:16.557
About those stolen horses?

25:16.624 --> 25:18.292
Okay, now I'm hurt,

25:18.360 --> 25:19.726
but I understand.

25:19.794 --> 25:21.462
You know, building trust,
it's a like a process.

25:21.529 --> 25:22.863
I get it.
You know, baby steps.

25:22.931 --> 25:25.032
Come on. I know you work
in this business,

25:25.100 --> 25:26.200
you hear things.

25:26.268 --> 25:28.234
Okay, maybe I want
to help you,

25:28.302 --> 25:31.004
but how do I know you're not
gonna do something stupid

25:31.072 --> 25:32.905
like calling the cops?

25:32.974 --> 25:34.674
I give you my word.

25:34.741 --> 25:36.776
Your word...

25:37.711 --> 25:41.181
I want to take you
seriously, Ty.

25:41.248 --> 25:42.815
Okay.

25:42.883 --> 25:44.383
What the hell?
Even with your record,

25:44.451 --> 25:46.651
cops probably won't believe
anything you say anyway, right?

25:48.654 --> 25:50.789
Okay, here's what
you gotta understand.

25:50.857 --> 25:52.958
These days,
the racing business,

25:53.026 --> 25:54.526
well,
it's regulated to death.

25:54.594 --> 25:57.062
It's about as exciting
as going to sleep.

25:57.130 --> 25:58.430
If you're looking
for something...

26:06.405 --> 26:07.338
If you're looking
for something

26:07.406 --> 26:08.672
a little more hardcore,

26:08.740 --> 26:10.875
it's easily found
if you know where to look.

26:10.942 --> 26:12.210
With the right connections,

26:12.277 --> 26:14.479
you can buy yourself
a private day at the track,

26:14.546 --> 26:17.414
no limits, no worries.
No nothin'.

26:17.482 --> 26:20.750
So let's say I wanted
to see this for myself?

26:20.818 --> 26:22.785
Well, these things are
kinda like a moveable feast.

26:22.853 --> 26:25.255
They're all over the place,
right?

26:25.323 --> 26:26.623
I've kind of been
steering clear myself,

26:26.690 --> 26:29.026
on account of my pesky
little gambling habit.

26:29.093 --> 26:30.994
But...

26:31.061 --> 26:32.128
I might be able
to help you out.

26:32.195 --> 26:33.195
Let me see what I can do.

26:33.263 --> 26:35.297
Just, you know,
keep it quiet.

26:35.365 --> 26:36.765
All right?

26:45.308 --> 26:47.542
All right, thanks
for the coffee.

26:47.609 --> 26:49.310
You're okay
staying here with Jack?

26:49.378 --> 26:50.745
Why can't I come?

26:50.812 --> 26:52.447
Because I gotta
talk to Murphy.

26:52.515 --> 26:53.748
If I don't,
this whole investigation

26:53.815 --> 26:55.216
will grind to a halt.

26:55.284 --> 26:56.717
Yeah, but you said
I was part of the team.

26:56.785 --> 26:58.986
Yeah, well, this is something
I gotta do myself.

26:59.055 --> 27:00.721
I'll talk to you later.

27:00.789 --> 27:02.590
Yeah. Sure.
Whatever.

27:06.161 --> 27:07.528
Match races?

27:07.595 --> 27:09.296
Yeah, just two horses
at a time,

27:09.364 --> 27:10.464
on a quarter mile
straightaway,

27:10.532 --> 27:12.332
so they can run them
anywhere.

27:12.400 --> 27:14.234
But they use racehorses,

27:14.302 --> 27:15.902
off the track,
and usually stolen.

27:15.970 --> 27:16.903
Like Cisco.

27:16.971 --> 27:18.305
And real jockeys.

27:18.373 --> 27:19.638
So it's like a private day
at the track

27:19.706 --> 27:20.673
for a few high-rollers.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.575
Oh, like Wade.

27:22.642 --> 27:24.444
Yeah.
And you were right;

27:24.511 --> 27:25.644
When the horses break down,

27:25.712 --> 27:27.046
they hop them up on speed

27:27.114 --> 27:28.214
so they get a few more races
out of them.

27:29.483 --> 27:32.151
Okay,
so what're we gonna do?

27:34.121 --> 27:36.688
Wade gave me an address.

27:46.932 --> 27:49.534
So, cowboy.

27:50.669 --> 27:52.703
What?
What happened?

27:52.770 --> 27:53.770
Hey,
after all that flirting,

27:53.838 --> 27:54.705
I thought you'd
at least call.

27:54.772 --> 27:55.872
That was flirting then.

27:55.940 --> 27:57.074
Yeah.
I didn't deck you,

27:57.142 --> 27:58.509
so what else would you
call it?

27:58.577 --> 27:59.577
Just being friendly.

27:59.644 --> 28:02.179
No.
I got enough friends.

28:02.247 --> 28:04.848
Okay. So...
What does that make me then?

28:04.916 --> 28:05.916
Well, I don't know.

28:05.984 --> 28:07.883
Why don't we go out
and find out?

28:08.819 --> 28:11.821
Dinner, movie,
whatever you like.

28:11.888 --> 28:13.856
Sure, but uh...

28:14.791 --> 28:16.692
The whole married
cowboy thing?

28:16.760 --> 28:19.061
What? I asked around.

28:19.130 --> 28:21.331
Apparently your wife
ditched you on your honeymoon

28:21.398 --> 28:23.198
and then she dragged
you off to B.C.

28:23.166 --> 28:24.065
And then she ditched you again.

28:24.134 --> 28:26.701
Hey, my marriage
was no joke.

28:27.637 --> 28:28.803
I'm just saying,

28:28.871 --> 28:29.971
you're not really
married married, so...

28:32.039 --> 28:33.074
I'm willing to make
an exception

28:33.143 --> 28:37.078
to the married cowboy
rule if you are.

28:37.147 --> 28:38.947
Think about it.

28:46.555 --> 28:48.088
He's gonna meet us there
to make sure we can get in.

28:48.157 --> 28:49.757
And why should we believe
anything that Wade says?

28:49.824 --> 28:51.526
Because he's got a pretty
good idea who stole Cisco.

28:51.593 --> 28:53.161
So you trust him then?

28:53.228 --> 28:54.695
I don't know.

28:54.763 --> 28:56.129
But if we don't do something,
those horses are gonna die.

28:56.197 --> 28:57.430
Hey! Where are you going?
Can I come?

28:57.498 --> 28:59.065
No, Shane,
not this time.

28:59.133 --> 29:01.000
Hey, Shane, can you
close the tailgate? Thanks.

29:18.907 --> 29:22.342
You know,
I'm just not the cheating kind.

29:22.410 --> 29:24.111
Mm-hmm.

29:24.178 --> 29:25.578
So you're not going out
with her?

29:25.646 --> 29:27.047
Well, not exactly.

29:27.115 --> 29:29.116
I mean, we're doing dinner
at Maggie's, but...

29:29.183 --> 29:30.918
You go on a real date
and there's no turning back.

29:32.185 --> 29:34.020
Well, once you start seeing
other women,

29:34.087 --> 29:36.255
it's prty much a sure sign
your marriage is over.

29:36.323 --> 29:37.623
You know what I mean?

29:37.690 --> 29:40.159
Trust me,
been there, done that.

29:40.227 --> 29:41.894
Yeah?

29:41.962 --> 29:43.729
Well, I mean, sure,
the whole Bedford Oil thing

29:43.797 --> 29:46.799
must've put a huge strain
on your relationship.

29:46.866 --> 29:48.133
What?

29:48.200 --> 29:49.334
I mean, you must feel like
a huge loser

29:49.402 --> 29:50.735
with Lou being
the breaeadwinner

29:50.803 --> 29:53.204
and you being
the stay-at-home whatever.

29:53.272 --> 29:54.739
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What're you talking about?

29:55.674 --> 29:56.975
I guess
I just didn't realize

29:57.043 --> 29:58.243
you guys were even close
to splitting up.

29:58.311 --> 30:00.278
I... Caleb,

30:00.346 --> 30:02.247
Lou and I are fine.

30:02.315 --> 30:03.381
I'm talking about
my first marriage.

30:04.615 --> 30:05.682
Me too.

30:06.784 --> 30:07.851
Oh...

30:21.665 --> 30:25.468
<i>Did Wade say
there was gonna be security?</i>

30:25.535 --> 30:27.603
No. He just said
he'd meet us here.

30:31.575 --> 30:33.176
<i>Well, he's not here.</i>

30:33.243 --> 30:35.078
<i>So what are we supposed to do,
just sit here and wait?</i>

30:35.145 --> 30:37.045
What if Cisco's in there?

30:38.014 --> 30:39.147
You're right.

30:39.949 --> 30:41.716
We'll find another way in,
okay?

30:41.784 --> 30:43.952
And what about another way out?

30:44.020 --> 30:45.087
I'll make it work.

31:00.167 --> 31:01.167
It's over there.

31:01.235 --> 31:03.136
We can hop that fence.

31:18.719 --> 31:21.988
All right,
laddies and gentlemen...

31:22.055 --> 31:23.255
I don't see Cisco.

31:23.323 --> 31:25.190
Or Wade.

31:25.258 --> 31:26.726
<i>The betting window
is closed</i>

31:26.793 --> 31:29.495
<i>for the first race
of the day,</i>

31:29.563 --> 31:31.897
and now you're gonna see it--

31:32.832 --> 31:36.501
<i>One winner, one loser.</i>

31:36.569 --> 31:38.469
<i>Is as simple as that.</i>

31:38.504 --> 31:40.605
<i>Only one horse can win.</i>

31:41.541 --> 31:42.674
They're at the post...

31:46.746 --> 31:47.878
<i>And they're off!</i>

32:08.265 --> 32:11.133
And it's number
two by half a length!

32:13.537 --> 32:14.604
Great.

32:17.274 --> 32:18.007
What?

32:18.075 --> 32:19.875
Liam's here.

32:22.946 --> 32:24.046
I'm not surprised
to see him.

32:24.113 --> 32:26.114
Yeah.
Me neither.

32:30.453 --> 32:31.453
The winner!

32:33.590 --> 32:34.656
Come on,
this way.

33:05.319 --> 33:06.486
That's him,
that's Cisco.

33:06.553 --> 33:07.820
<i>Hey, buddy.</i>

33:07.887 --> 33:10.188
<i>All right, he looks okay.</i>

33:10.256 --> 33:12.057
Let's get him
out of here.

33:12.125 --> 33:13.692
Hi.

33:13.760 --> 33:15.761
I know, I know,
I know.

33:24.336 --> 33:25.369
Well,
he's a little anxious,

33:25.437 --> 33:27.471
but it's just stress,
not drugs.

33:27.539 --> 33:28.472
- Good.
- What's your plan?

33:28.540 --> 33:29.774
I mean, where's Wade?

33:29.842 --> 33:30.908
How're we gonna get
these horses outta here?

33:30.976 --> 33:32.376
<i>We could ride them out.</i>

33:32.444 --> 33:33.811
Shane?!

33:33.879 --> 33:35.312
What are you doing here?!

33:35.380 --> 33:36.648
I figured you
could use some help,

33:36.715 --> 33:37.481
so I hitched a ride
in the back of your truck.

33:37.549 --> 33:39.050
Well,
you figured wrong.

33:39.118 --> 33:40.583
Come on,
there's four horses.

33:40.652 --> 33:41.652
We could each ride one,
we'll lead the other one.

33:41.719 --> 33:42.753
Okay, this is serious.

33:42.820 --> 33:44.187
Ty, we've got get Shane
outta here.

33:44.255 --> 33:45.756
Well,
what about Cisco?

33:45.823 --> 33:47.157
I'm calling the police.

33:47.224 --> 33:48.391
No, Amy, wait! Don't! Okay?

33:48.459 --> 33:50.293
I promised Wade.

33:50.361 --> 33:51.561
Promised him what?

33:51.629 --> 33:52.462
Sort of like a deal
with the devil.

33:52.530 --> 33:53.864
If he helped us out,

33:53.931 --> 33:55.098
I promised that we wouldn't
call the cops.

33:55.131 --> 33:56.098
Someone's coming.

33:56.266 --> 33:57.332
Oh! Shut it!

33:58.468 --> 34:00.036
Come on, let's go!

34:05.608 --> 34:06.676
Hey!

34:08.145 --> 34:10.379
I know you.
What're you doing in here?

34:11.813 --> 34:12.813
Um...

34:12.882 --> 34:13.815
Hey!

34:13.882 --> 34:14.815
Ungh!

34:16.719 --> 34:18.386
Whoa!

34:18.453 --> 34:19.587
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
betting is open</i>

34:19.655 --> 34:21.289
<i>for the next race
of the day!</i>

34:21.356 --> 34:22.757
<i>We're just waiting on
jockey number four</i>

34:22.824 --> 34:24.391
<i>to take his position.</i>

34:27.529 --> 34:28.594
Come on, come on,
come on.

34:31.166 --> 34:33.833
Flip him over!
Flip him over!

34:33.902 --> 34:37.469
All right.
Come on, let's go.

34:38.681 --> 34:41.018
<i>Just a couple more minutes
to place those bets.</i>

34:41.554 --> 34:44.723
<i>No stats, no book,
no racing form.</i>

34:44.791 --> 34:49.428
Just you, your instinct
and your horse sense.

34:50.663 --> 34:52.364
<i>So make your bets!</i>

34:52.431 --> 34:53.799
Okay. Remember,

34:53.866 --> 34:55.199
you don't wanna end up
in the winner's circle

34:55.268 --> 34:57.435
with everybody watching,
okay? So you can't win.

34:57.470 --> 34:58.903
Okay.

34:58.971 --> 34:59.737
I think that's gonna be
the least of my worries.

34:59.805 --> 35:00.871
<i>Okay.</i>

35:04.410 --> 35:06.077
All right, come on!

35:07.012 --> 35:08.512
And here we go, folks!

35:08.580 --> 35:11.682
<i>Jockey number four,
riding a big Chestnut.</i>

35:11.750 --> 35:13.717
<i>This looks like
a good match-up.</i>

35:29.200 --> 35:31.434
<i>They're at the post!</i>

35:34.737 --> 35:36.272
<i>And... they're off!</i>

35:40.444 --> 35:41.643
Come on, go! Go!

35:41.711 --> 35:43.311
Uh, we don't want her
to win, okay?

35:44.614 --> 35:46.481
<i>Cheer 'em on, folks!</i>

35:46.548 --> 35:48.016
Come on! Come on!

35:51.454 --> 35:52.387
Slow down!

35:52.455 --> 35:53.621
This isn't good.

35:53.689 --> 35:55.056
<i>Here they come!</i>

35:55.124 --> 35:56.291
Go, Cisco! Go!

35:56.359 --> 35:57.459
Shhh!

35:57.526 --> 35:58.360
What're you doing
with that?

35:58.427 --> 35:59.560
- Put that away!
- Okay.

36:03.831 --> 36:05.966
<i>Number four takes the win!</i>

36:08.169 --> 36:09.636
No!

36:09.704 --> 36:11.438
Jokey number
four makes it look easy.

36:11.506 --> 36:12.639
Too easy.

36:15.443 --> 36:17.777
<i>Jockey number four
to the winner's circle.</i>

36:17.845 --> 36:18.777
What?

36:24.184 --> 36:26.185
It's Wade,
he's here.

36:28.422 --> 36:30.623
<i>Jockey number four
to the winner's circle.</i>

36:32.259 --> 36:33.559
So what's the plan now?

36:33.627 --> 36:35.627
Don't bug me,
okay?

36:35.694 --> 36:36.761
I don't know.

36:38.697 --> 36:40.399
Come on, Amy,
get out of there.

36:40.466 --> 36:41.900
Come on over here,
number four.

36:41.967 --> 36:44.469
You just won a big payday
for a few minutes of work.

36:48.774 --> 36:50.774
<i>Hey! Number four!
You don't want your money?!</i>

36:50.842 --> 36:51.942
Okay, come on,
let's go!

36:52.010 --> 36:53.177
Okay.

36:53.245 --> 36:56.247
No problem.
I'll spend it for you.

36:56.314 --> 36:57.214
Hey!

36:58.983 --> 37:00.451
Perfect timing, huh?

37:00.519 --> 37:01.685
What did you do, stop
for a beer on the way?

37:01.753 --> 37:03.587
Ah.

37:03.655 --> 37:04.721
Let's go!

37:06.490 --> 37:08.791
Shane,
in the truck, now!

37:08.859 --> 37:10.360
Easy, easy, easy!

37:11.295 --> 37:12.728
- Okay, come on.
- Got him?

37:13.664 --> 37:14.730
Come on.

37:15.966 --> 37:17.633
Last one! Let's go!

37:19.002 --> 37:20.636
Let's go! Let's go!

37:29.979 --> 37:31.345
Hey! Hey!

37:31.413 --> 37:33.114
Stop those guys!
Stop them!

37:33.182 --> 37:34.916
They're stealing the horses!

37:36.953 --> 37:38.954
<i>Someone's
stealing the horses!</i>

37:39.021 --> 37:39.955
Don't let that truck
out of here,

37:40.022 --> 37:41.089
no matter what!

37:46.294 --> 37:48.295
Okay, everybody,
we're shutting 'er down.

37:48.362 --> 37:49.597
Now! Let's go!

38:12.753 --> 38:14.386
He's got a gun!

38:14.454 --> 38:15.387
Get down!

38:26.499 --> 38:27.733
I don't believe it!

38:27.800 --> 38:29.067
The guy actually took
a shot at us!

38:29.135 --> 38:30.669
Would you turn
that thing off!

38:30.737 --> 38:33.071
And don't you dare tell Dad,
okay?

38:33.139 --> 38:34.204
Thanks, man.
That was awesome!

38:42.508 --> 38:44.008
<i>So, thanks for the call.</i>

38:44.076 --> 38:45.476
It's too bad everyone had
already packed up and left

38:45.544 --> 38:47.111
by the time
we got to the ranch.

38:47.179 --> 38:48.312
And miss Fleming?

38:48.380 --> 38:49.647
How about the next time

38:49.714 --> 38:50.781
you decide to take the law
into your own hands,

38:50.849 --> 38:53.116
you call us before,
not after the fact?

38:53.184 --> 38:54.484
Yeah.

38:54.552 --> 38:57.020
It's starting to feel like
it runs in the family.

39:01.392 --> 39:02.659
Amy...

39:03.561 --> 39:05.429
What were you doing
getting mixed up in that?

39:05.496 --> 39:06.930
I don't know. I was just-

39:06.997 --> 39:09.031
I was worried
about the horses.

39:09.099 --> 39:10.166
Yeah, well, so was I,

39:10.233 --> 39:11.567
but you should've
called me first.

39:13.370 --> 39:16.038
So how did Cisco do
in his maiden race?

39:16.106 --> 39:19.175
He was amazing.

39:19.242 --> 39:20.443
I mean, that horse
has so much heart.

39:20.510 --> 39:21.743
He wanted to be out in front
so bad

39:21.811 --> 39:22.778
that I couldn't hold him back.

39:22.845 --> 39:24.245
See?
Tim, I told you.

39:24.313 --> 39:25.547
We have a real winner
on our hands.

39:25.614 --> 39:26.914
You were right.

39:26.982 --> 39:29.150
And Ty,
I wanna apologize.

39:30.086 --> 39:32.387
Your stepfather wasn't
the bad guy.

39:32.455 --> 39:35.356
I told you, he's
not my stepfather.

39:36.292 --> 39:38.359
I'll try
to remember that.

39:42.797 --> 39:43.863
Okay, okay.

39:46.067 --> 39:48.668
<i>So I missed you yesterday.</i>

39:48.736 --> 39:50.971
Yeah. Yeah, sorry.

39:51.038 --> 39:52.639
I thought you were
gonna be giving me a hand,

39:52.707 --> 39:54.040
but I guess Amy and Ty,

39:54.109 --> 39:56.875
they needed your help
a little more than I did?

39:56.943 --> 39:58.644
Yeah.

39:58.712 --> 40:00.546
You know, I tried
to talk them out of it...

40:00.614 --> 40:04.150
And they wouldn't listen,
you know.

40:04.218 --> 40:05.884
I even told them
it was crazy dangerous.

40:05.952 --> 40:07.520
Dangerous?
Really?

40:07.588 --> 40:09.388
Not that I would know.

40:09.456 --> 40:10.456
I mean, they made me
stay in the truck

40:10.524 --> 40:12.591
the whole time so...

40:14.660 --> 40:17.695
Remember when I told you
about being a grown-up?

40:17.763 --> 40:20.198
Well, that does not include
lying to me.

40:20.266 --> 40:21.633
And if you knew me better,

40:21.700 --> 40:23.602
you'd know that,
sooner or later,

40:23.669 --> 40:26.605
I'm gonna get the truth
outta you,

40:26.672 --> 40:28.672
somehow, some way.

40:35.113 --> 40:36.913
Yeah! Okay! Okay!
I was with them!

40:36.981 --> 40:38.516
It was totally awesome!

40:38.583 --> 40:40.417
When the guy at the gate
pulled out the gun--

40:40.485 --> 40:43.219
Gun? Wait a min-
what gun?

40:45.523 --> 40:47.590
Are you gonna tell my dad?

40:47.658 --> 40:48.824
No.

40:48.892 --> 40:50.059
I figure that's something
a grown-up

40:50.127 --> 40:51.794
should take care of himself.

40:57.768 --> 40:59.035
Doesn't look like much,

40:59.102 --> 41:00.669
but this is where the foundation
will go...

41:00.736 --> 41:01.770
Eventually.

41:01.837 --> 41:03.138
Wow.

41:03.206 --> 41:05.274
So what's the next step?

41:07.210 --> 41:08.243
I don't know.

41:08.311 --> 41:09.344
I thought I'd buy
a big shovel

41:09.412 --> 41:11.513
and take it all out,
bit by bit.

41:11.581 --> 41:13.248
I've got nothing else
to do.

41:13.316 --> 41:15.883
What do you mean,
"nothing else to do"?

41:15.950 --> 41:18.052
Honey,
you are a father

41:18.119 --> 41:19.320
raising a daughter,

41:19.388 --> 41:21.389
and you're doing
an incredible job!

41:21.456 --> 41:22.890
You know...
I mean, you even cook!

41:22.957 --> 41:24.725
Isn't that something?

41:24.793 --> 41:26.360
Mama!

41:26.428 --> 41:29.230
Oh my... oh my God!
Did you hear that?

41:29.298 --> 41:31.198
She just said "mama"!

41:31.265 --> 41:32.399
Yeah! Finally!

41:32.466 --> 41:35.835
Oh, that's my girl.
Yes, I'm your mama.

41:36.770 --> 41:39.172
Her first word!
Her first word.

41:39.240 --> 41:42.742
Honey, I was so afraid I
would miss it. Me too.

41:43.678 --> 41:44.611
Yes, I'm your mama!

41:44.679 --> 41:46.045
Oh...

Hey, Ashley.

42:17.776 --> 42:19.843
I'm glad I got my horse back,

42:19.910 --> 42:22.779
but... Amy and Ty,

42:22.847 --> 42:24.648
what the hell
were they thinking?

42:24.716 --> 42:26.450
They're supposed to be
responsible for Shane.

42:26.517 --> 42:29.018
They put him in harm's way
to save a few horses.

42:29.086 --> 42:30.153
The way I heard it,

42:30.221 --> 42:31.121
they didn't even know
he was there

42:31.188 --> 42:32.289
until it was too late.

42:32.357 --> 42:33.624
So what am I supposed
to do?

42:33.691 --> 42:35.591
Punish the kid?

42:35.659 --> 42:37.526
Cisco means a lot to him.

42:37.594 --> 42:39.295
Well, at least
he had the backbone

42:39.363 --> 42:41.264
to tell you the truth.

42:41.331 --> 42:45.868
I can't believe he did
what he did.

42:45.935 --> 42:47.903
Makes a father proud.

42:48.838 --> 42:51.673
He's got some of his old man
in him after all.

42:51.741 --> 42:54.041
That's exactly what you
and I would've done in our day!

42:54.109 --> 42:55.910
Yeah, and that might be
something

42:55.978 --> 42:58.980
you want to keep
to yourself.

43:06.221 --> 43:10.791
You don't have to keep
beating yourself up over this.

43:11.726 --> 43:14.161
I just wish I knew what
he wanted from me, that's all.

43:14.228 --> 43:15.128
Well, it doesn't matter
what he wants.

43:15.196 --> 43:17.531
You don't owe him
anything.

43:17.599 --> 43:20.734
You don't understand
the world that he's from.

43:20.802 --> 43:22.869
Nothing comes
without a price.

43:22.937 --> 43:24.370
There are no favours.

43:24.438 --> 43:25.538
That is the past,

43:25.606 --> 43:28.441
and you don't have
to go back to that.

43:28.509 --> 43:29.309
I wish it was that easy.

43:29.376 --> 43:31.010
It is that easy.

43:31.077 --> 43:33.780
You don't ever have to have
anything to do with him, ever again.

43:37.584 --> 43:39.018
Right?

43:39.085 --> 43:40.151
Right.

Hey, Lilly, what's up?

43:57.168 --> 43:59.737
I bet you didn't expect
to hear from me, huh?

43:59.805 --> 44:01.439
I know. Yeah.

44:03.441 --> 44:05.942
Hey, I ran into Ty
the other day.

44:06.009 --> 44:07.444
Oh, he's good.

44:07.511 --> 44:09.479
He just, uh, got himself
into a little bit of a jam,

44:09.547 --> 44:10.947
needed my help.

44:11.882 --> 44:15.084
No, no, I was glad
to be there for him.

44:16.086 --> 44:17.487
You know...

44:18.255 --> 44:21.590
I got a really good feeling
about this, Lilly.

44:21.658 --> 44:23.826
I think maybe it's...

44:23.893 --> 44:26.762
Maybe it's time we can all put
the past behind us.
