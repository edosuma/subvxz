00:18.819 --> 00:22.556
[muttering indistinctly]

00:42.776 --> 00:45.113
[grunts]

00:59.593 --> 01:02.096
[speaking Spanish]

01:25.319 --> 01:27.221
[hammering]

01:29.790 --> 01:34.695
[muttering in Spanish]

02:03.791 --> 02:05.793
[chokes]

02:10.264 --> 02:12.233
BAJAR LO.
GET HIM DOWN.

02:16.637 --> 02:19.607
[Massive Attack's Teardrop]

02:19.640 --> 02:27.648
*

02:50.638 --> 02:52.906
WHAT YOU GOT
AGAINST CHICKENS?

02:52.940 --> 02:55.243
ONE GOT CHOKED LAST NIGHT,
THANKS TO YOU.

02:55.276 --> 02:58.446
33-YEAR-OLD MALE
WITH HEMOPTYSIS, FEVER...

02:58.479 --> 02:59.813
CAN'T WE EVEN TALK
ABOUT IT?

02:59.847 --> 03:01.815
YOU CAN'T APOLOGIZE,
WE CAN'T TALK.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.517
AND PUNCTURE WOUNDS.

03:03.551 --> 03:05.886
I'M NOT APOLOGIZING
FOR DOING THE RIGHT THING.

03:05.919 --> 03:08.256
LYING TO ME
WAS NOT THE RIGHT THING.

03:08.289 --> 03:11.292
PUNCTURE WOUNDS
ARE FROM A CRUCIFIXION.

03:14.862 --> 03:17.531
I LIED
TO SAVE MY PATIENT'S LIFE.

03:17.565 --> 03:19.933
I DIDN'T LIE TO YOU.
I LIED TO MY BOSS.

03:19.967 --> 03:22.970
EITHER OF THOSE ARGUMENTS
WORKING YET?

03:25.539 --> 03:26.940
I GUESS THAT MEANS
I DON'T HAVE TO GO

03:26.974 --> 03:28.776
TO THE WEDDING ON SATURDAY.

03:28.809 --> 03:31.879
THE HOSPITAL'S
CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD?

03:31.912 --> 03:34.482
I'M NOT GONNA STAND HIM UP,
AND NEITHER ARE YOU.

03:34.515 --> 03:35.783
I LOATHE WEDDINGS

03:35.816 --> 03:37.518
AND THEIR SEVEN LEVELS
OF HYPOCRISY.

03:37.551 --> 03:38.919
BUT YOU DO SEEM
AWFULLY HISSY.

03:38.952 --> 03:40.321
AND THERE'S AN OUTSIDE CHANCE

03:40.354 --> 03:42.890
THAT I COULD GET YOU DRUNK
AND SCORE.

03:42.923 --> 03:44.992
SO AS LONG AS YOU DON'T TAKE IT
AS AN ADMISSION OF GUILT,

03:45.025 --> 03:46.994
SURE,
COUNT ME IN.

03:47.027 --> 03:48.862
A BIT TOO MUCH HONESTY?

03:48.896 --> 03:51.465
YOU'RE ALSO GOING
TO THE REHEARSAL DINNER

03:51.499 --> 03:53.000
FRIDAY NIGHT.

03:53.033 --> 03:55.703
DRESSY CASUAL.

04:02.009 --> 04:03.444
HOUSEKEEPING.

04:03.477 --> 04:04.912
EITHER YOU'RE CRAZY

04:04.945 --> 04:07.748
OR YOU'RE ATONING
FOR SOMETHING NAUGHTY

04:07.781 --> 04:09.683
AND YOU'RE CRAZY.

04:09.717 --> 04:11.919
HE'S A DOCTOR.

04:11.952 --> 04:13.454
I'M NOT ATONING
FOR ANYTHING.

04:13.487 --> 04:15.323
THAT ANSWERS THAT.
THANKS.

04:15.356 --> 04:16.590
(Ramon)
MY MARISA WAS DIAGNOSED

04:16.624 --> 04:17.925
WITH TERMINAL BRAIN CANCER.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.927
STAGE IV GLIOBLASTOMA.

04:19.960 --> 04:22.730
WHEN THE DOCTORS SAID
SHE HAD TWO MONTHS TO LIVE,

04:22.763 --> 04:25.933
THAT'S WHEN I MADE MY BARGAIN.

04:25.966 --> 04:28.602
WITH YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE
CARRIER?

04:28.636 --> 04:30.471
WITH GOD.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.306
OH.
I TOLD HIM

04:32.340 --> 04:34.642
I WOULD NAIL MYSELF
TO A CROSS EVERY YEAR

04:34.675 --> 04:35.976
HE KEPT HER ALIVE.

04:36.009 --> 04:37.044
HOW DID THAT NEGOTIATION GO?

04:37.077 --> 04:39.980
YOU LOWBALLED WITH EAR PIERCING
AND GOD COUNTERED?

04:40.013 --> 04:41.449
(Ramon)
THREE WEEKS LATER,

04:41.482 --> 04:42.983
SHE WAS CANCER-FREE.

04:43.016 --> 04:44.485
AND THAT WAS FOUR YEARS AGO.

04:44.518 --> 04:47.054
PONTIUS PILATE--
MISUNDERSTOOD ONCOLOGIST.

04:47.087 --> 04:50.023
MY EX-WIFE THINKS
I'M CRAZY TOO.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.925
SHE MOVED OUT
THE FIRST TIME I DID THIS.

04:51.959 --> 04:55.396
WELL, AT LEAST YOUR DAUGHTER
HAS ONE VIABLE ROLE MODEL.

04:55.429 --> 04:57.064
YOU DON'T BELIEVE
IN GOD?

04:57.097 --> 04:58.932
I DID.
THEN I GREW MY CURLY HAIRS.

05:00.501 --> 05:02.069
SO HOW DO YOU THINK
I WAS CURED?

05:02.102 --> 05:03.937
MAYBE YOU WERE MISDIAGNOSED
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.474
YOU HAVE YOUR ANSWER,
DOCTORS.

05:06.507 --> 05:07.541
WE HAVE OURS.

05:07.575 --> 05:08.609
CAUSAL DETERMINISM.

05:08.642 --> 05:11.679
WE ARE HARDWIRED
TO NEED ANSWERS.

05:11.712 --> 05:13.847
THE CAVE MAN WHO HEARD A RUSTLE
IN THE BUSHES

05:13.881 --> 05:15.349
CHECKED OUT TO SEE WHAT IT WAS

05:15.383 --> 05:16.684
LIVED LONGER THAN THE GUY
WHO ASSUMED

05:16.717 --> 05:17.785
IT WAS JUST A BREEZE.

05:17.818 --> 05:20.821
THE PROBLEM IS, WHEN WE
DON'T FIND A LOGICAL ANSWER,

05:20.854 --> 05:21.955
WE SETTLE
FOR A STUPID ONE.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.924
RITUAL IS WHAT HAPPENS

05:23.957 --> 05:25.693
WHEN WE RUN OUT
OF RATIONAL.

05:25.726 --> 05:26.794
(Chase)
IF YOU'RE DONE MOCKING HIM,

05:26.827 --> 05:27.961
WE NEED TO PREP
FOR AN LP.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.663
GOOD.

05:29.697 --> 05:31.999
ANOTHER HOLE IN HIM
SHOULD REALLY MAKE GOD'S DAY.

05:38.872 --> 05:39.873
WHY ARE YOU LATE?

05:39.907 --> 05:42.075
YOUR NEXT DENTAL APPOINTMENT
ISN'T TILL JANUARY,

05:42.109 --> 05:44.144
AND YOU JUST SAW YOUR GP
EIGHT DAYS AGO.

05:44.177 --> 05:47.515
YOU THINK STAGE IV GLIOBLASTOMA
IN AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD

05:47.548 --> 05:48.816
COULD DISAPPEAR
IN THREE WEEKS?

05:48.849 --> 05:51.619
I HAD A FLAT TIRE.
YOUR PATIENT HAS CANCER?

05:51.652 --> 05:53.821
YOUR TIRES GOT LESS
THAN 5,000 MILES ON THEM.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.989
NO, AND NEITHER DOES
MY PATIENT'S DAUGHTER.

05:56.023 --> 05:56.857
I HIT A PIECE OF REBAR

05:56.890 --> 05:58.826
NEAR A CONSTRUCTION SITE.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.661
IN THREE WEEKS?

06:00.694 --> 06:01.995
IT'S HIGHLY UNLIKELY.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.163
THERE'S NO CONSTRUCTION SITE

06:03.196 --> 06:04.465
BETWEEN HERE
AND YOUR HOME.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.033
I AGREE.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.501
I THINK IT WAS
A MISDIAGNOSED CYST.

06:07.535 --> 06:09.770
BUT THERE IS ONE
BETWEEN HERE AND MY DRY CLEANER.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.038
IT COULD BE
A MISDIAGNOSIS,

06:11.071 --> 06:13.106
OR IT COULD BE
SPONTANEOUS REMISSION.

06:13.140 --> 06:14.542
BUT...

06:14.575 --> 06:15.743
WHY WOULD I LIE
ABOUT THIS?

06:15.776 --> 06:17.010
I DON'T KNOW YET.

06:17.044 --> 06:18.045
BUT YOU WOULD HAVE DROPPED OFF
YOUR TIE.

06:18.078 --> 06:20.080
IT'S GOT A MUSTARD STAIN.

06:25.486 --> 06:27.888
I WAS BUYING
AN ENGAGEMENT RING.

06:27.921 --> 06:30.524
I'M GONNA PROPOSE TO SAM
AT THE WEDDING.

06:30.558 --> 06:33.561
THAT IS THE SECOND STUPIDEST
THING I'VE HEARD TODAY.

06:33.594 --> 06:35.195
AND I'M SURPRISED
HOW CLOSE YOU CAME.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.798
YOU DON'T NEED
TO BUY HER A NEW RING.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.900
ISN'T THE FIRST ONE GOOD
FOR ALL YOU CAN MARRY?

06:39.933 --> 06:43.036
I ASSUME YOU HAVEN'T APOLOGIZED
TO CUDDY YET.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.772
YOUR STUPIDITY DEMANDS
EQUAL TIME.

06:44.805 --> 06:46.206
NOTHING TO APOLOGIZE FOR.

06:46.239 --> 06:49.577
PRETEND TO APOLOGIZE.

06:49.610 --> 06:50.778
YOU WANT ME TO LIE?

06:50.811 --> 06:51.945
THERE'S A LOVELY SYMMETRY
TO IT.

06:51.979 --> 06:52.913
THE LIE GOT YOU INTO IT.

06:52.946 --> 06:53.914
A LIE GETS YOU OUT OF IT.

06:53.947 --> 06:55.549
EVERYBODY LIES.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.585
I'M SURE CUDDY...

06:59.019 --> 07:02.022
JUST NEED TO GIVE HER
A CHANCE.

07:04.124 --> 07:06.794
YEAH, THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
WHAT I MEANT.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.596
HAVE YOU SEEN
THE BRIDE-TO-BE?

07:08.629 --> 07:10.831
GORGEOUS WOMAN
HALF HIS AGE.

07:10.864 --> 07:11.832
HE'S A LUCKY GUY.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.601
YEAH, FOR A WHILE.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.836
MY FATHER'S 19 YEARS OLDER
THAN MY MOTHER,

07:15.869 --> 07:17.938
AND THEY'VE BEEN HAPPILY MARRIED
FOR 32 YEARS.

07:17.971 --> 07:20.841
I'M GUESSING YOUR DAD WASN'T
ON THE FORBES 400

07:20.874 --> 07:22.710
AND YOUR MOM DIDN'T LOOK
LIKE A SWIMSUIT MODEL.

07:23.977 --> 07:25.946
SORRY.
THAT DIDN'T COME OUT RIGHT.

07:25.979 --> 07:28.081
MY FATHER WAS THE CLASSICS CHAIR
AT COLUMBIA,

07:28.115 --> 07:30.851
AND MY MOTHER WAS HIS STUDENT.

07:30.884 --> 07:33.921
HIS GORGEOUS STUDENT.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.557
WHAT'S IT MEAN
WHEN SOMEBODY TAKES

07:36.590 --> 07:37.625
THEIR CELL PHONE
INTO THE BATHROOM

07:37.658 --> 07:39.593
WHEN THEY'RE TAKING
A SHOWER?

07:39.627 --> 07:41.829
IT MEANS THEY DON'T WANT YOU
TO CHECK THEIR CALLS,

07:41.862 --> 07:42.963
EMAILS, OR TEXTS.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.632
IF WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT YOUR WIFE,

07:44.665 --> 07:48.836
IT MEANS THE CHICKENS
ARE COMING HOME TO ROOST.

07:48.869 --> 07:51.004
TAUB HAS BEEN KNOWN
TO DABBLE.

07:51.038 --> 07:52.205
USED TO BE.

07:52.239 --> 07:54.642
(Masters)
MAYBE IT'S JUST A HABIT.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.510
I DO THAT WITH MY CELL PHONE,
AND I LIVE ALONE.

07:56.544 --> 07:58.846
SHE HAS A MEETING TODAY
AT 1:30.

07:58.879 --> 08:00.614
AT A HOTEL.

08:00.648 --> 08:03.016
I'M GONNA GO
WITH THE CHICKEN THING.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.719
NEGATIVE FOR TOXOCARA,
BACTEROIDES,

08:05.753 --> 08:07.921
ASCARIS,
EVERYTHING.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.289
SO WHAT LOOKS
LIKE AN INFECTION

08:09.322 --> 08:12.092
BUT DOESN'T TEST
LIKE ONE?

08:12.125 --> 08:13.927
ANIMALS.

08:13.961 --> 08:15.062
I'M SURE
YOUR WIFE'S JUST SEEING A DUDE.

08:15.095 --> 08:18.832
PATIENT WORKS
FOR MORGAN TIMBER WORKS.

08:18.866 --> 08:20.033
CARD'S IN THE FILE.

08:20.067 --> 08:22.636
SPECIALIZING IN STABLES,
BARNS, AND STALLS.

08:22.670 --> 08:25.005
HE WORKS AROUND ANIMALS.
RHODOCOCCUS EQUI.

08:25.038 --> 08:27.007
UNLESS THIS GUY'S
SLEEPING IN THE MANGER...

08:27.040 --> 08:29.910
OR HAS A HISTORY
OF OPEN WOUNDS.

08:35.082 --> 08:36.249
[door slides open]

08:36.283 --> 08:38.786
WE THINK YOU HAVE
RHODOCOCCUS EQUI,

08:38.819 --> 08:39.887
A HORSE INFECTION.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.922
IT'S PRETTY RARE IN HUMANS,
BUT EASILY TREATABLE

08:41.955 --> 08:42.723
WITH ANTIBIOTICS.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.858
DOES IT MAKE
YOUR TEETH FALL OUT?

08:44.892 --> 08:48.028
NO.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.837
THEN AGAIN,
MAYBE WE WERE WRONG.

09:00.841 --> 09:02.209
FEVER,
COUGHING UP BLOOD,

09:02.242 --> 09:04.211
COUGHING UP TEETH.

09:04.244 --> 09:06.146
SO EITHER GOD SWEETENED THE DEAL

09:06.179 --> 09:10.217
WITH A "NO FLOSSING" CLAUSE
OR...

09:10.250 --> 09:11.752
RADIATION SICKNESS.

09:11.785 --> 09:14.154
YEAH, MAYBE THE CARPENTER
BUILDS MICROWAVE OVENS.

09:14.187 --> 09:15.923
KAPOSI'S SARCOMA?

09:15.956 --> 09:17.090
NO SKIN LESIONS.

09:17.124 --> 09:18.291
HEAVY METAL POISONING FITS.

09:18.325 --> 09:20.994
CANNED TUNA, SUSHI,
LEAD PAINT.

09:21.028 --> 09:22.863
HEAVY METAL IT IS.
DO A HOME SEARCH

09:22.896 --> 09:24.097
AND A PERIPHERAL SMEAR.

09:24.131 --> 09:24.898
I CAN'T.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.667
I HAVE
A PERSONAL ERRAND TO RUN.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.870
TRYING TO CATCH
YOUR WIFE CHEATING?

09:29.903 --> 09:30.938
OH...

09:30.971 --> 09:33.340
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

09:33.373 --> 09:34.742
MISSING MOJO.

09:34.775 --> 09:35.909
POSTURE'S SLUMPED.

09:35.943 --> 09:37.077
EXPRESSION DEFEATED.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.912
DIDN'T TRY TO BACK UP
YOUR THEORY.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.013
AND CHASE TOLD ME.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.751
GO.
FIND YOUR MOJO.

09:51.024 --> 09:53.827
SHOPKEEPER?
I NEED A PATIENT FILE.

09:53.861 --> 09:55.162
ASK RECORDS.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.196
NOT ONE OF OUR PATIENTS.

09:56.229 --> 09:57.831
MY PATIENT'S DAUGHTER.

09:57.865 --> 09:59.399
ASK YOUR PATIENT.
HE THINKS I ONLY WANT IT

09:59.432 --> 10:00.734
TO DEBUNK HIS FAITH.

10:00.768 --> 10:02.302
AND WHY WOULD HE THINK THAT?

10:02.335 --> 10:05.105
BECAUSE HE'S STRANGELY
PERCEPTIVE FOR AN IDIOT.

10:05.138 --> 10:08.375
AND I'M GOING TO VIOLATE
PATIENT PRIVACY LAWS

10:08.408 --> 10:10.110
JUST TO KEEP YOU HAPPY?

10:10.143 --> 10:13.080
YOU KEEP ME HAPPY,
I RETURN THE FAVOR.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.281
THINK OF IT
AS TAT FOR TIT.

10:14.314 --> 10:15.816
WHEN WE'RE AT WORK,

10:15.849 --> 10:18.952
WE NEED TO FOCUS
ON OUR WORK THOUGHTS.

10:18.986 --> 10:21.655
WHY ARE YOU WEARING THAT?

10:21.689 --> 10:23.090
IT'S MY DRESSY CASUAL.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.091
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

10:24.124 --> 10:25.726
YOU LOOK LIKE WILSON.

10:25.759 --> 10:27.828
IT LOOKS WEIRD.

10:27.861 --> 10:30.163
WELL, YOU KNEW
I'D THINK THAT.

10:30.197 --> 10:31.899
WHICH MAKES ME WONDER
WHY YOU LOOK DISAPPOINTED.

10:31.932 --> 10:34.034
IF YOU PRICK ME,
DO I NOT BLEED?

10:34.067 --> 10:38.238
YOU KNEW I WOULDN'T LIKE IT,
BUT YOU THOUGHT

10:38.271 --> 10:40.107
I WOULD SAY I DID.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.308
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.844
YOU'RE TRYING TO TRAP ME
INTO LYING TO YOU.

10:43.877 --> 10:44.845
YOU SURE?

10:44.878 --> 10:46.246
'CAUSE THAT SOUNDS
SO JUVENILE.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.955
YOU'RE OKAY
WITH BURGLARY NOW?

10:54.988 --> 10:56.724
I ASKED HIS PERMISSION.

10:56.757 --> 10:59.993
THE REASON
WE DON'T ASK PERMISSION

11:00.027 --> 11:02.029
IS WE'RE AFRAID THE PATIENT
IS GOING

11:02.062 --> 11:03.196
TO HIDE SOMETHING,
BUT OUR PATIENT

11:03.230 --> 11:05.032
HASN'T BEEN HOME,
LIVES ALONE.

11:05.065 --> 11:05.899
HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY HELP,

11:05.933 --> 11:08.268
AND HE HAS NO MOTIVE
TO HIDE ANYTHING.

11:08.301 --> 11:10.070
DID YOU ASK
FOR HIS KEY TOO?

11:10.103 --> 11:11.972
OH, DOESN'T HAVE ONE.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.876
[laughs]

11:19.212 --> 11:21.481
AND NOW WE KNOW WHY.

11:21.514 --> 11:24.217
YOU THINK HE'S CRAZY?

11:24.251 --> 11:26.253
CRUCIFIXION'S
PRETTY CONVINCING EVIDENCE.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.287
LEAD PAINT?

11:27.320 --> 11:30.323
THE PLACE IS TOO NEW.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.793
HE BELIEVES IN A HIGHER POWER
THAT CAN AFFECT HIS LIFE.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.828
LIKE MOST PEOPLE
ON THE PLANET.

11:34.862 --> 11:36.063
TRUE.
ON THE OTHER HAND,

11:36.096 --> 11:37.064
CRUCIFIED HIMSELF.

11:37.097 --> 11:39.399
NO CANNED TUNA.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.301
AND I DON'T THINK WE HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT SUSHI.

11:41.334 --> 11:43.270
NO COMPUTER.
NO TELEVISION.

11:43.303 --> 11:45.939
NO MUSIC.
WHAT DOES HE DO?

11:45.973 --> 11:47.407
HE READS.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.976
PRAYER'S BEEN PROVEN
TO AID RECOVERY.

11:49.009 --> 11:51.111
ONLY IF THE PERSON KNOWS
THEY'RE BEING PRAYED FOR.

11:51.144 --> 11:54.347
MEANS THERE'S
NO OBJECTIVE EFFECT.

11:54.381 --> 11:57.050
SO FAITH COMES FROM WITHIN.

11:57.084 --> 11:59.086
NOT EXACTLY A NEWSFLASH.

12:06.326 --> 12:09.329
I GUESS WORRY IS GOOD
FOR THE WAISTLINE.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.337
IT'S NOT WORRY.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.306
IT'S STARVATION.

12:19.339 --> 12:20.373
HIS TOOTH DIDN'T FALL OUT

12:20.407 --> 12:21.909
BECAUSE
OF HEAVY METAL POISONING.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.110
IT FELL OUT
BECAUSE OF MALNUTRITION.

12:23.143 --> 12:25.012
HE DOES HAVE RHODOCOCCUS EQUI.

12:25.045 --> 12:28.081
TAUB WAS RIGHT.

12:28.115 --> 12:30.250
HE JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHY.

12:35.923 --> 12:36.990
IT'S LOCKED.

12:37.024 --> 12:38.826
(Wilson)
I'M BUSY!

12:38.859 --> 12:40.060
I'LL WAIT.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.395
[drawer shuts]

12:42.429 --> 12:44.832
[feet shuffling]

12:44.865 --> 12:45.933
I REALLY AM BUSY.

12:45.966 --> 12:48.368
CUDDY GOT ME
THE DAUGHTER'S FILE.

12:48.401 --> 12:51.304
WELL, NOT CUDDY EXACTLY.
HER SIGNATURE.

12:51.338 --> 12:55.408
WELL, NOT EXACTLY
HER SIGNATURE.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.910
ANOTHER LIE?

12:56.944 --> 12:58.445
THOUGHT YOU COULD TAKE
A LOOK AT IT FOR ME.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.347
MAYBE YOU HADN'T HEARD.
I'M KIND OF BUSY.

13:00.380 --> 13:01.548
WITH WHAT?

13:01.581 --> 13:03.884
SUDOKU.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

13:03.917 --> 13:08.121
I'M THE HEAD OF ONCOLOGY
AT A MAJOR HOSPITAL.

13:08.155 --> 13:09.957
AND YET THESE FILES

13:09.990 --> 13:13.126
ARE NOT FROM THIS HOSPITAL.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.963
THESE ARE FROM
WHERE-MY-FIANCEE-WORKS MEMORIAL.

13:15.996 --> 13:18.031
SAM'S BOSS IS DOING
A CLINICAL REVIEW

13:18.065 --> 13:19.399
OF ALL OF HER FILES,

13:19.432 --> 13:20.934
AND SHE JUST WANTED
TO MAKE SURE

13:20.968 --> 13:22.569
EVERYTHING WAS IN ORDER
BEFORE HE STARTS ON MONDAY.

13:22.602 --> 13:25.973
WHICH EXPLAINS WHY SAM
IS TOO BUSY TO LOOK AT MY FILE.

13:26.006 --> 13:29.142
IF I DON'T HELP HER, SHE CAN'T
GO TO THE WEDDING AND...

13:29.176 --> 13:30.978
WE FELL IN LOVE
AT HER COUSIN'S WEDDING,

13:31.011 --> 13:33.146
WHICH IS WHY I WANT
TO PROPOSE TO HER AT A WEDDING.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.215
AND NOW YOU HAVE 60 SECONDS

13:35.248 --> 13:37.050
TO BERATE ME FOR THAT
AND FOR HELPING MY GIRLFRIEND

13:37.084 --> 13:37.985
WITH HER HOMEWORK.

13:38.018 --> 13:39.619
YOU DON'T WANT TO PROPOSE
AT A WEDDING.

13:39.652 --> 13:42.122
EMOTIONS RUNNING HIGH,
PEOPLE ON EDGE.

13:42.155 --> 13:45.458
YOU OUGHT TO TRY SOMEWHERE
LIKE A BUDDHIST TEMPLE

13:45.492 --> 13:47.127
OR AN AQUARIUM.

13:47.160 --> 13:50.130
OR A BUDDHIST AQUARIUM.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.598
THAT ONLY TOOK TEN SECONDS.

13:51.631 --> 13:54.534
YOU CAN SPEND THE REST
OF THE TIME ON MY FILE.

14:00.007 --> 14:02.175
RACHEL?

14:09.016 --> 14:13.320
[beeping]

14:13.353 --> 14:17.057
HEY.
HOW LONG BEFORE YOU'RE HOME?

14:17.090 --> 14:18.158
NOT LONG.

14:18.191 --> 14:21.194
UH, HEY.

14:21.228 --> 14:23.964
HEY.

14:23.997 --> 14:26.967
UH, YOU LEFT YOUR LAPTOP ON.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.137
SAW YOU TODAY.

14:30.170 --> 14:31.671
AT THE HOTEL.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.907
WERE YOU CHECKING UP ON ME?

14:33.941 --> 14:35.976
YES.

14:36.009 --> 14:37.344
SATISFIED?

14:37.377 --> 14:39.980
YES.

14:40.013 --> 14:42.149
GOOD.

14:42.182 --> 14:45.085
THAT'S IT?

14:45.118 --> 14:46.219
YOU SAID
YOU'RE SATISFIED.

14:46.253 --> 14:48.355
IT'S ENOUGH.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.224
YOU'RE NOT WONDERING
WHY IT STARTED.

14:51.258 --> 14:52.993
THAT MAKES ME THINK

14:53.026 --> 14:54.161
YOU DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THIS,

14:54.194 --> 14:55.295
WHICH MAKES ME THINK...

14:55.328 --> 14:56.429
YOU'RE BEING PARANOID.

14:56.463 --> 14:57.597
YOU TOOK YOUR CELL PHONE

14:57.630 --> 14:59.099
WITH YOU
INTO THE BATHROOM

14:59.132 --> 15:00.267
WHEN YOU TOOK YOUR SHOWER
THIS MORNING.

15:02.635 --> 15:05.272
I MADE A NEW FRIEND.

15:05.305 --> 15:07.007
ONLINE.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.109
IN A SUPPORT GROUP.

15:09.142 --> 15:11.678
A GUY?

15:11.711 --> 15:13.947
YES.

15:13.981 --> 15:15.949
A SUPPORT GROUP FOR WHAT?

15:15.983 --> 15:19.452
FOR PEOPLE
WITH UNFAITHFUL SPOUSES.

15:24.091 --> 15:26.659
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US
YOU WERE STARVING YOURSELF?

15:26.693 --> 15:29.562
WELL, I WASN'T TRYING TO.

15:29.596 --> 15:34.534
I'M ON A TIGHT BUDGET,
AND IT SEEMED LIKE AN OKAY DIET.

15:34.567 --> 15:35.969
WELL, YOU SEEM
TO BE FELLING BETTER.

15:36.003 --> 15:37.370
NOT REALLY.

15:37.404 --> 15:39.973
MY LEGS ARE KILLING ME.

15:41.608 --> 15:44.044
HOW BAD IS THE PAIN?

15:44.077 --> 15:47.547
ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN,
TEN BEING THE WORST.

15:47.580 --> 15:50.583
9 1/2.

15:50.617 --> 15:53.186
THEN WHY ARE YOU SMILING?

15:53.220 --> 15:55.488
I'M NOT SMILING.

16:01.561 --> 16:05.032
(Foreman)
LEG PAIN
AND PSEUDOBULBAR AFFECT.

16:05.065 --> 16:06.199
HE'S FEELING ONE EMOTION

16:06.233 --> 16:08.368
WHILE UNKNOWINGLY EXPRESSING
ANOTHER ONE.

16:08.401 --> 16:10.270
CLASSIC NEUROHECATIA.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.539
TWO DAYS
OF ANTICHOLINERGICS,

16:12.572 --> 16:13.540
YOU'LL BE WALKING
OUT OF HERE.

16:13.573 --> 16:15.275
REALLY?

16:15.308 --> 16:17.110
NO.
I JUST MADE THAT UP

16:17.144 --> 16:18.178
TO SEE YOUR REACTION.

16:18.211 --> 16:19.746
DIAGNOSTIC TEST.

16:19.779 --> 16:22.449
THIS IS AWESOME.

16:22.482 --> 16:26.586
33-YEAR-OLD CARPENTER
PRESENTING WITH NARCISSISM,

16:26.619 --> 16:28.321
DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR,
HALLUCINATIONS.

16:28.355 --> 16:30.023
HE HASN'T HAD HALLUCINATIONS.

16:30.057 --> 16:31.058
(House)
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT HIM.

16:31.091 --> 16:32.259
I'M TALKING ABOUT "HIM"

16:32.292 --> 16:34.494
WITH A CAPITAL "O-M-G."

16:34.527 --> 16:35.728
YOU WANT US TO DO
A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

16:35.762 --> 16:37.030
ON JESUS?

16:37.064 --> 16:38.598
HEARS VOICES,

16:38.631 --> 16:40.133
THINKS HE'S THE SON OF GOD.

16:40.167 --> 16:41.701
PROBABLY SCHIZOPHRENIC.

16:41.734 --> 16:44.037
I THINK YOU OFFENDED HIM.

16:44.071 --> 16:46.139
YOU'RE SAYING THE PATIENT'S
RELIGIOUS EXTREMISM

16:46.173 --> 16:48.075
COULD BE A SYMPTOM.

16:48.108 --> 16:49.609
A NEURO DISORDER COULD EXPLAIN
ALL HIS DELUSIONS.

16:49.642 --> 16:50.743
GET AN MRI
OF HIS BRAIN.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.612
LET'S SEE
IF WE CAN FIND GOD.

16:57.284 --> 16:59.552
HEARD YOU GOT
THE DAUGHTER'S FILE.

16:59.586 --> 17:01.121
PATIENT CHANGE HIS MIND?

17:01.154 --> 17:04.624
I FORGED YOUR SIGNATURE.

17:04.657 --> 17:07.694
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR HONESTY.

17:07.727 --> 17:09.596
THINK OF IT
AS A PRESENT.

17:09.629 --> 17:12.699
SEE, SOMEBODY IS ABOUT
TO TURN THE BIG 4-5

17:12.732 --> 17:14.567
IN SEVERAL MONTHS,
AND SOMEBODY ELSE

17:14.601 --> 17:16.536
WANTS TO MAKE
A VERY BIG DEAL OF IT.

17:16.569 --> 17:17.837
4-3.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.672
4-3.

17:19.706 --> 17:21.641
ARE YOU SURE?
VERY.

17:21.674 --> 17:24.244
HOW COULD I MAKE
SUCH A MISTAKE?

17:24.277 --> 17:26.679
IN READING
YOUR H.R. FILE?

17:26.713 --> 17:28.848
OH, NO, WAIT,
I DIDN'T.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.717
AND BOOM GOES THE DYNAMITE.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.785
SCORES ARE TIED.
WE ARE EVEN STEVEN.

17:32.819 --> 17:33.720
YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:33.753 --> 17:36.089
I DID LIE.
TO H.R.

17:36.123 --> 17:38.425
NOT TO YOU.

17:38.458 --> 17:41.228
WHEN I FIRST APPLIED
FOR THE VP ADMIN JOB,

17:41.261 --> 17:42.662
I WAS 29 YEARS OLD.

17:42.695 --> 17:44.231
I KNEW I WOULD BE TAKEN
MORE SERIOUSLY

17:44.264 --> 17:46.633
IF I WERE
IN MY EARLY 30s,

17:46.666 --> 17:47.600
SO I ADDED TWO YEARS
TO MY AGE.

17:47.634 --> 17:50.803
YOU LIED
TO MAKE YOURSELF OLDER?

17:50.837 --> 17:52.139
ARE YOU LYING
ABOUT BEING A WOMAN?

17:52.172 --> 17:54.307
EVEN IF YOU CAN TRAP ME,

17:54.341 --> 17:56.709
YOU THINK I'LL SUDDENLY EMBRACE
THE VALUE OF LYING?

17:56.743 --> 17:58.311
MY POINT IS
YOU ALREADY HAVE.

17:58.345 --> 18:00.347
I JUST NEED TO PROVE IT.

18:05.652 --> 18:06.686
(Taub)
CHICKENS AREN'T ROOSTING.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.621
SHE'S JUST GOT A FRIEND.

18:08.655 --> 18:10.323
A GUY SHE MET
IN AN ONLINE SUPPORT GROUP

18:10.357 --> 18:11.891
FOR CHEATING SPOUSES.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.726
I'VE HEARD
OF THAT GROUP.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.329
IT'S CALLED IRONY.

18:16.363 --> 18:17.697
YOU THINK
SHE'S CHEATING ON HER SPOUSE

18:17.730 --> 18:20.733
WITH SOMEONE FROM
A CHEATING SPOUSE SUPPORT GROUP?

18:20.767 --> 18:23.303
SOUNDS LIKE THE PERFECT PLACE
TO HIT ON VULNERABLE WOMEN.

18:23.336 --> 18:24.571
LOOK.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.773
MULTIPLE DENSE LESIONS.

18:26.806 --> 18:30.743
IT LOOKS
LIKE M.S.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.712
HOW DID WE MISS M.S.?

18:32.745 --> 18:35.748
IT WAS HIDING
BEHIND THE MALNUTRITION.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.550
M.S. ATTACKS
THE IMMUNE SYSTEM.

18:37.584 --> 18:38.618
NO SYSTEM,
NO SYMPTOMS.

18:38.651 --> 18:43.323
AND NOW WE'RE FEEDING HIM,
SO THEY'RE BOTH BACK.

18:44.524 --> 18:46.559
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

18:46.593 --> 18:49.629
TERRIBLE.

18:49.662 --> 18:52.399
OBVIOUSLY.

18:52.432 --> 18:53.700
WHERE ARE YOUR FRIENDS?

18:53.733 --> 18:55.935
STILL CASTING LOTS
FOR YOUR CLOTHES?

18:55.968 --> 18:58.171
ALL I ASK
IS THAT THEY PRAY FOR ME.

18:58.205 --> 18:59.172
ALWAYS SACRIFICING.

18:59.206 --> 19:01.708
VERY INSPIRATIONAL.

19:01.741 --> 19:03.843
THE LESIONS
ARE IN YOUR TEMPORAL LOBES.

19:03.876 --> 19:05.612
WHEN THOSE AREAS
GET MESSED WITH,

19:05.645 --> 19:07.280
PEOPLE HAVE
STRANGE EXPERIENCES--

19:07.314 --> 19:08.748
LIKE HAUNTINGS,
ALIEN ABDUCTIONS,

19:08.781 --> 19:09.849
PAST LIVES.

19:09.882 --> 19:11.651
DEALS WITH GOD?

19:11.684 --> 19:13.853
YOU DIDN'T COME
TO SEE IF I WAS BETTER.

19:13.886 --> 19:16.923
YOU CAME TO SEE IF YOUR MEDICINE
HAS TURNED ME INTO AN ATHEIST.

19:16.956 --> 19:18.691
I'D SETTLE
FOR AGNOSTIC.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.193
FAITH IS NOT A DISEASE.

19:20.227 --> 19:21.361
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

19:21.394 --> 19:23.463
ON THE OTHER HAND,
IT IS COMMUNICABLE,

19:23.496 --> 19:25.332
AND IT KILLS
A LOT OF PEOPLE.

19:25.365 --> 19:30.737
[coughing]

19:34.274 --> 19:37.244
I CAN'T MOVE MY ARM.

19:40.347 --> 19:42.215
YOU FEEL THAT?

19:45.818 --> 19:48.521
YOUR FRIENDS
ARE NOT PRAYING HARD ENOUGH.

19:52.359 --> 19:53.360
(Chase)
IT'S NOT M.S.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.595
PARALYSIS IS A SYMPTOM
OF M.S.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.597
SO ARE LEG PAIN
AND PSEUDOBULBAR AFFECT.

19:57.630 --> 19:58.898
HE'S GETTING WORSE
ON THE PREDNISONE.

19:58.931 --> 19:59.899
IT'S NOT M.S.

19:59.932 --> 20:00.967
(Taub)
THE MRI WAS CLEAR.

20:01.000 --> 20:01.801
HE HAS LESIONS.

20:01.834 --> 20:04.271
COULD BE AN AVM,
CEREBRAL INFARCTION.

20:04.304 --> 20:06.473
(House)
LET'S PUT IT TO THE VOTE.

20:06.506 --> 20:09.242
VEST OR CUMMERBUND?

20:09.276 --> 20:10.610
CUMMERBUND.

20:10.643 --> 20:12.579
YOU KNOW ME.

20:12.612 --> 20:14.347
I CAN'T SAY NO
TO ANY OF YOU GUYS.

20:14.381 --> 20:15.615
YOU'RE ALL CORRECT.

20:15.648 --> 20:16.716
HE HAS M.S.

20:16.749 --> 20:19.286
BUT NOT THE FRIENDLY
MR. ROGERS M.S.

20:19.319 --> 20:22.422
THIS IS THE WEIRD GUY
IN THE PANEL VAN KIND.

20:22.455 --> 20:23.456
MARBURG M.S.?

20:23.490 --> 20:24.891
WHAT DID I JUST SAY?

20:24.924 --> 20:26.993
HE'LL BE DEAD IN TWO
TO THREE DAYS AT THE MOST.

20:27.026 --> 20:28.027
THAT'S UNLESS WE CAN GET
SOMEONE

20:28.060 --> 20:30.029
TO NAIL THEMSELVES
TO A CROSS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.265
OR STEM CELL TREATMENT.

20:32.299 --> 20:34.033
THAT'S
AN EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.503
THAT'S HAD PROMISING RESULTS
WITH DEMYELINATING DISEASES.

20:36.536 --> 20:38.037
IT'S OUR BEST SHOT.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.273
IT WOULD BE IF IT WASN'T
EMBRYONIC STEM CELL TREATMENT.

20:40.307 --> 20:41.608
OUR PATIENT'S RIGHT
OF THE POPE.

20:41.641 --> 20:42.742
HE'S NEVER GONNA CONSENT
TO THAT.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.511
I KNOW THAT,
AND YOU KNOW THAT.

20:44.544 --> 20:45.912
HE DOESN'T KNOW THAT.

20:45.945 --> 20:47.013
BUT NOW SHE KNOWS THAT,

20:47.046 --> 20:48.881
HE'S GONNA KNOW THAT.

20:48.915 --> 20:49.949
WAY TO GO.

20:49.982 --> 20:51.718
CONFIRM MARBURG.

20:51.751 --> 20:55.588
THEN SEE IF HE'S
A FAIR-WEATHER FLAGELLATOR.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.031
(imitating Sean Connery)
YOU LOOK SMASHING,

21:05.064 --> 21:06.366
MISS MONEYPENNY.

21:06.399 --> 21:07.367
(German accent)
CUMMERBUND?

21:07.400 --> 21:09.569
VERY FOOLISH, MR. BOND.

21:09.602 --> 21:12.038
THE DAUGHTER'S CASE CHECKS OUT.

21:12.071 --> 21:13.840
STEREOTACTIC BIOPSY CONFIRMED

21:13.873 --> 21:15.842
STAGE IV GLIOBLASTOMA
MULTIFORME.

21:15.875 --> 21:17.444
DOESN'T RESPOND
TO CHEMO,

21:17.477 --> 21:19.546
BUT THEY GAVE IT
TO HER ANYWAY

21:19.579 --> 21:21.448
AS A HAIL MARY
AND JUST GOT LUCKY.

21:21.481 --> 21:25.485
SO EITHER GOD INTERVENED,
WHICH IS A LAZY EXPLANATION,

21:25.518 --> 21:27.420
OR WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHY.

21:27.454 --> 21:28.988
WHICH IS NO EXPLANATION.

21:29.021 --> 21:31.658
SOMETIMES
THERE IS NO EXPLANATION.

21:31.691 --> 21:33.493
AND I'M JUST FINE
WITH THAT.

21:33.526 --> 21:35.061
WHICH ANNOYS ME TO NO END.

21:35.094 --> 21:37.497
I NEED THAT FILE,
THAT CHAIR,

21:37.530 --> 21:38.698
AND THAT DESK.

21:42.502 --> 21:46.806
YOUR WOMAN
IS FUDGING THE FACTS.

21:46.839 --> 21:48.608
FIVE OF THOSE CASES,

21:48.641 --> 21:50.710
THE STATED DOSES DON'T EXPLAIN
THE RADIATION DAMAGE.

21:50.743 --> 21:51.811
SENSITIVITIES VARY.

21:51.844 --> 21:54.481
NOT THAT MUCH.

21:56.015 --> 21:58.351
YEAH.

21:58.385 --> 22:01.388
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

22:03.456 --> 22:06.493
I ASKED HER POINT BLANK
ABOUT THIS.

22:06.526 --> 22:08.595
SHE SAID
THE DOSAGES WERE ACCURATE

22:08.628 --> 22:10.430
AND THAT SHE HAD DONE
NOTHING WRONG.

22:10.463 --> 22:13.533
'CAUSE MORALLY SHE DIDN'T.

22:13.566 --> 22:15.668
ALL FIVE PATIENTS
WERE TERMINAL.

22:15.702 --> 22:17.136
SHE EXCEEDED
THE DOSING PROTOCOLS

22:17.169 --> 22:18.538
TO TRY TO SAVE THEIR LIFE.

22:18.571 --> 22:19.406
YOU WOULD HAVE DONE
THE SAME.

22:19.439 --> 22:21.408
SHE'S A SAP,
AND SHE'S PERFECT FOR YOU.

22:23.009 --> 22:25.011
[door slams]

22:26.145 --> 22:28.615
I HATE REHEARSAL DINNERS
ALMOST AS MUCH

22:28.648 --> 22:30.917
AS I HATE WEDDINGS.

22:30.950 --> 22:32.519
THE ONLY REASON
ANYONE GETS MARRIED

22:32.552 --> 22:36.055
IS THAT HOMO ERECTUS FEMALES
NEEDED PROTECTION

22:36.088 --> 22:39.492
FROM PREDATORS
WHILE BREAST FEEDING.

22:39.526 --> 22:41.127
THE ONLY REASON
THESE TWO ARE GETTING MARRIED

22:41.160 --> 22:43.062
IS TO THROW
AN OBNOXIOUS GALA

22:43.095 --> 22:45.064
AND MAKE THE REST OF US
FEEL UNWORTHY.

22:45.097 --> 22:46.666
EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW
IN TWO YEARS

22:46.699 --> 22:48.067
THEIR LAWYERS
ARE GONNA BE FIGHTING

22:48.100 --> 22:49.569
OVER THE BENTLEYS.

22:49.602 --> 22:52.439
THAT'LL MAKE
A LOVELY TOAST.

22:52.472 --> 22:54.541
SHE'S GOT LOOKS.
HE'S GOT MONEY.

22:54.574 --> 22:58.511
ONE OF THEM IS
BOUND TO RUN OUT.

22:58.545 --> 23:01.147
I GIVE IT 19 MONTHS.

23:01.180 --> 23:03.550
THAT'S VERY SPECIFIC.

23:03.583 --> 23:04.617
NO FAULT DIVORCE IN NEW JERSEY

23:04.651 --> 23:08.855
REQUIRES COUPLES TO LIVE
AT LEAST 18 MONTHS APART.

23:08.888 --> 23:11.691
I'M ACTUALLY ONLY GIVING IT
A FEW WEEKS.

23:11.724 --> 23:14.026
OH. THOUGHT I WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE THE DARK ONE.

23:14.060 --> 23:15.495
[cell phone ringing]
NOT TODAY.

23:15.528 --> 23:16.629
YEAH.

23:20.700 --> 23:21.834
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO GO STAG.

23:21.868 --> 23:23.436
MY PATIENT
IS REFUSING TREATMENT.

23:23.470 --> 23:25.572
AND YOU CARE?
NO.

23:25.605 --> 23:28.575
BUT IT'S AN EXCUSE
YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH.

23:31.644 --> 23:32.479
(Ramon)
ACCEPTING THIS TREATMENT

23:32.512 --> 23:34.881
IS AN INSULT
TO GOD.

23:34.914 --> 23:37.917
I CAN'T EXPECT HIM
TO KEEP OUR DEAL.

23:37.950 --> 23:38.985
YOU ALREADY BROKE IT.

23:39.018 --> 23:40.653
YOUR BLOOD TEST SHOWED

23:40.687 --> 23:41.921
YOU WERE LOADED
WITH IBUPROFEN.

23:41.954 --> 23:43.756
TAKING PAINKILLERS
BREAKS MY DEAL?

23:43.790 --> 23:44.891
THE POINT
IS TO SUFFER

23:44.924 --> 23:46.626
LIKE YOUR SAVIOR DID,
RIGHT?

23:46.659 --> 23:50.129
WELL, HE DIDN'T TAKE MYRRH,
THE TYLENOL OF ANCIENT ROME.

23:50.162 --> 23:51.831
AND HIS NAILS WENT
THROUGH HIS WRISTS,

23:51.864 --> 23:53.132
NOT THROUGH HIS PALMS.

23:53.165 --> 23:54.133
PALMS ARE FOR SISSIES.

23:54.166 --> 23:56.135
AND WHAT ABOUT THE 39 LASHES

23:56.168 --> 23:58.638
AND THE BEATINGS
AND THE CROWN OF THORNS?

23:58.671 --> 24:00.773
WHAT YOU GO THROUGH
IS CLOSER TO A BAD MANICURE

24:00.807 --> 24:01.974
THAN A CRUCIFIXION.

24:02.008 --> 24:03.676
IT'S NOT ABOUT SHOWING GOD
MY PAIN.

24:03.710 --> 24:06.178
IT'S ABOUT SHOWING HIM
MY FAITH.

24:06.212 --> 24:08.147
IF HE ASKS ME
TO DIE FOR MY DAUGHTER,

24:08.180 --> 24:09.215
I'LL DO IT GLADLY.

24:09.248 --> 24:12.118
DON'T MAKE THIS
ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER.

24:12.151 --> 24:13.786
YOU'RE JUST WORRIED THAT
IF WE FIND A CURE,

24:13.820 --> 24:15.555
THAT IT'LL COST YOU
YOUR FAITH.

24:15.588 --> 24:16.489
AND THEN YOU'LL BE
LIKE THE REST OF US.

24:16.523 --> 24:18.858
ALONE AND AFRAID?

24:18.891 --> 24:20.527
YOU'RE RIGHT.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.562
I DON'T WANT THAT.
YOU'RE SMILING.

24:22.595 --> 24:23.630
DOES THAT MEAN
THAT YOU'RE COMFORTABLE

24:23.663 --> 24:24.831
WITH YOUR CHOICE?

24:24.864 --> 24:26.666
OR THAT YOU'RE AFRAID?

24:26.699 --> 24:27.900
BECAUSE THIS MAY BE
YOUR ONLY HOPE.

24:27.934 --> 24:29.636
YOU CAN PRESCRIBE
A LOT OF THINGS,

24:29.669 --> 24:31.037
BUT HOPE ISN'T ONE OF 'EM.

24:31.070 --> 24:32.505
STICKING BY YOUR CONVICTIONS

24:32.539 --> 24:34.741
AND DAMNING
THE CONSEQUENCES.

24:34.774 --> 24:36.543
YOU TWO HAVE A LOT
IN COMMON.

24:36.576 --> 24:39.912
YOU'RE BOTH IDIOTS.

24:46.252 --> 24:48.555
ALL CONVICTION'S
EQUALLY RIDICULOUS?

24:48.588 --> 24:51.123
JUST WHEN THEY'RE APPLIED
INDISCRIMINATELY

24:51.157 --> 24:52.825
TO ALL CIRCUMSTANCES.

24:52.859 --> 24:54.594
HE NEEDS TO SEE
HIS DAUGHTER.

24:54.627 --> 24:56.195
HE NEEDS TO SEE
INHERIT THE WIND.

24:56.228 --> 24:59.198
AND TELL HER HE'S DYING
BECAUSE GOD DOESN'T WANT HIM

24:59.231 --> 25:01.233
TO TAKE HIS MEDICINE.

25:04.771 --> 25:07.574
HONESTY'S NOT ALL BAD.

25:07.607 --> 25:10.142
GET HER IN HERE.

25:18.317 --> 25:20.920
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DIE,
NOT IF YOU TAKE THEIR MEDICINE.

25:23.623 --> 25:25.324
THE TREATMENT

25:25.357 --> 25:26.926
VIOLATES GOD'S LAWS.

25:26.959 --> 25:29.562
HE DOESN'T WANT ME
TO TAKE IT.

25:29.596 --> 25:31.998
BUT GOD DOESN'T WANT YOU
TO DIE.

25:32.031 --> 25:34.801
HE DOESN'T WANT ANYONE TO DIE.
HE'S ALL ABOUT LOVE.

25:34.834 --> 25:36.736
I KNOW
THIS IS COMING FROM YOUR MOTHER.

25:36.769 --> 25:38.270
THIS IS COMING FROM ME.

25:38.304 --> 25:39.338
I'M THE ONE
WHO ALMOST DIED.

25:39.371 --> 25:42.041
I KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE.

25:42.074 --> 25:45.344
AND YOU'RE MY DAD.
YOU CAN'T DIE.

25:45.377 --> 25:48.347
I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE TO.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.182
YOU DON'T HAVE TO,
DADDY.

25:50.216 --> 25:51.283
JUST TAKE THE MEDICINE.

25:51.317 --> 25:52.585
YOU ALWAYS TELL ME
TO TAKE THE MEDICINE.

25:52.619 --> 25:55.321
PLEASE.

25:58.357 --> 26:00.727
ONE DAY,

26:00.760 --> 26:01.861
YOU'RE GOING TO UNDERSTAND.

26:01.894 --> 26:02.962
NO, I'M NOT.

26:02.995 --> 26:06.999
I AM NEVER GOING
TO UNDERSTAND THAT.

26:07.033 --> 26:09.769
IF GOD COULD DO THIS,

26:09.802 --> 26:11.738
I HATE GOD.

[VV Brown's
Shark in the Water]

26:24.651 --> 26:26.352
*

26:26.385 --> 26:29.188
* SOMETIMES I GET MY HEAD

26:29.221 --> 26:31.624
* IN A DILLY

26:31.658 --> 26:33.860
* FEELING SO LOST

26:33.893 --> 26:35.995
* TICKING YOU OFF

26:38.665 --> 26:39.899
I JUST SPOTTED
A COUPLE OF HOT GIRLS

26:39.932 --> 26:41.000
BY THE CHOCOLATE FOUNTAIN.

26:41.033 --> 26:43.636
WEREN'T YOU JUST UPSTAIRS
WITH...

26:43.670 --> 26:45.638
AND IT WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED
IF NOT FOR YOU, BUDDY.

26:47.840 --> 26:50.376
SOMEONE HAD TO DISTRACT
THE SOBER FRIEND.

26:50.409 --> 26:51.878
I'M NOT HERE
TO BE YOUR WINGMAN.

26:51.911 --> 26:53.713
I'LL BE YOUR WINGMAN
THIS TIME.

26:53.746 --> 26:55.848
I DIDN'T COME HERE
TO GET LAID.

26:55.882 --> 26:56.949
THEN DON'T.

26:56.983 --> 26:58.284
TALKING TO BEAUTIFUL WOMEN

26:58.317 --> 26:59.652
ISN'T NEARLY AS MUCH FUN
AS WATCHING TAUB

26:59.686 --> 27:01.620
NOT TALKING
TO HIS WIFE.

27:07.860 --> 27:09.361
I WENT
THROUGH YOUR EMAILS.

27:09.395 --> 27:11.998
THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE
THAT'S INAPPROPRIATE.

27:12.031 --> 27:13.766
WE'RE FRIENDS, CHRIS.

27:13.800 --> 27:16.435
BUT YOU TELL HIM THINGS
THAT YOU'VE NEVER TOLD ME.

27:16.468 --> 27:18.705
I TELL HIM THINGS
I CAN'T TELL YOU.

27:18.738 --> 27:19.706
THAT'S THE POINT.

27:19.739 --> 27:20.873
NOT THINGS ABOUT ME.
ABOUT YOU.

27:20.907 --> 27:22.675
ABOUT YOUR NEW JOB.

27:22.709 --> 27:24.677
ABOUT COLORING YOUR HAIR.

27:24.711 --> 27:26.445
ABOUT HOW YOU FELT
WHEN YOUR MOTHER DIED.

27:26.478 --> 27:28.881
I WANT TO KNOW
THOSE THINGS.

27:28.915 --> 27:34.053
HE'S EASY TO TALK TO.

27:34.086 --> 27:36.355
HE'S OPEN AND HONEST.

27:36.388 --> 27:37.924
HE MAKES ME FEEL SAFE.

27:37.957 --> 27:39.726
SOUNDS LIKE YOU LOVE HIM.

27:39.759 --> 27:42.094
I AM NOT HAVING
AN AFFAIR.

27:42.128 --> 27:44.430
HE LIVES IN OREGON.
I'VE NEVER MET HIM.

27:44.463 --> 27:45.865
I PROBABLY NEVER WILL.

27:45.898 --> 27:48.200
YOU ARE HAVING AN AFFAIR.
AN EMOTIONAL ONE.

27:48.234 --> 27:50.069
ARE YOU EQUATING
WHAT I'M DOING

27:50.102 --> 27:51.437
WITH WHAT YOU DID?

27:51.470 --> 27:53.706
I'VE DONE TERRIBLE THINGS
TO YOU,

27:53.740 --> 27:55.775
AND I DESERVE ALL OF THIS
AND MORE,

27:55.808 --> 27:58.778
BUT YOU CAN'T PRETEND THAT
WHAT YOU'RE DOING ISN'T HURTFUL.

28:06.452 --> 28:08.120
SOMEONE LOOKS LOVELY TONIGHT.

28:08.154 --> 28:09.922
THANK YOU.

28:09.956 --> 28:13.125
I MEANT ME.

28:13.159 --> 28:16.362
SOMEONE ELSE
LOOKS SIMPLY STUNNING.

28:16.395 --> 28:20.466
THAT WAS YOU.
AND THE BLONDE AT THE BAR.

28:20.499 --> 28:22.268
JUST TO BE CLEAR,

28:22.301 --> 28:24.737
THIS WHOLE LITTLE ACT
ISN'T GONNA WORK.

28:24.771 --> 28:26.906
I NEED AN APOLOGY.

28:26.939 --> 28:28.207
NOT FLATTERY.

28:28.240 --> 28:30.009
IT'S NOT AN ACT.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.410
IT'S THE WEDDING.

28:31.443 --> 28:33.445
YOU HATE WEDDINGS.
I THOUGHT I DID.

28:33.479 --> 28:35.347
THEN I REALIZED
I'VE NEVER BEEN TO ONE.

28:35.381 --> 28:36.382
NEVER?

28:36.415 --> 28:38.918
TURNS OUT
THEY'RE KIND OF FUN.

28:38.951 --> 28:42.154
WELL, I CAN'T COMPLAIN
ABOUT MY BOSS.

28:42.188 --> 28:43.489
HE'S RIGHT HERE.

28:43.522 --> 28:45.758
YOU'RE HIS BOSS?

28:45.792 --> 28:47.359
ONLY MONDAYS
THROUGH FRIDAYS.

28:47.393 --> 28:49.728
ON THE WEEKENDS,
HE'S MY BRA.

28:54.033 --> 28:56.335
THIS ROUND'S
ON THE BRA.

29:04.510 --> 29:07.947
UM...

29:07.980 --> 29:11.283
I'M SORRY
ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER.

29:11.317 --> 29:13.319
I NEVER MEANT
TO HURT HER.

29:13.352 --> 29:16.488
YOU JUST THOUGHT
SHE WOULD CHANGE MY MIND.

29:16.522 --> 29:21.327
I WAS SURPRISED
SHE DIDN'T.

29:23.462 --> 29:24.496
SO WAS I.

29:26.132 --> 29:29.802
I DIDN'T TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

29:29.836 --> 29:31.971
WHEN I SAID
I'M NOT AFRAID TO DIE.

29:32.004 --> 29:35.341
BUT YOU'RE GOING
STRAIGHT TO HEAVEN, SO...

29:35.374 --> 29:37.443
THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE,

29:37.476 --> 29:39.411
BUT I'M HUMAN.

29:39.445 --> 29:42.281
SO YOU KNOW
YOU MAY BE WRONG.

29:42.314 --> 29:45.784
HOW COULD YOU DO
WHAT YOU JUST DID?

29:48.454 --> 29:50.389
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE BELIEFS.

29:50.422 --> 29:52.458
SO WE CAN STILL SEE
THE RIGHT THING TO DO

29:52.491 --> 29:55.094
WHEN WE'RE BLINDED
WITH DOUBT AND FEAR.

29:55.127 --> 29:58.497
OUR BELIEFS
DEFINE US.

29:58.530 --> 30:00.066
IF WE LOSE THEM,

30:00.099 --> 30:02.501
WHO ARE WE?

30:09.275 --> 30:11.844
LOOK, I'M SORRY.

30:11.878 --> 30:16.315
I DIDN'T MEAN
FOR IT TO GO THAT WAY.

30:17.884 --> 30:20.619
YOU THINK
I'M BEING SELFISH,

30:20.652 --> 30:24.456
BUT I'M NOT.

30:24.490 --> 30:28.127
HE MAKES ME FEEL BETTER
ABOUT ME AND ABOUT US.

30:28.160 --> 30:33.099
WELL, THAT IS HARD
TO BELIEVE,

30:33.132 --> 30:36.435
BECAUSE ALL I FEEL
RIGHT NOW IS BETRAYED.

30:36.468 --> 30:38.537
I NEVER WANTED THAT.

30:38.570 --> 30:40.072
GOOD.

30:40.106 --> 30:43.976
BECAUSE JUST LIKE YOU ASKED ME
TO STOP MY BEHAVIOR,

30:44.010 --> 30:46.578
I'M ASKING YOU
TO STOP THIS.

30:49.081 --> 30:51.383
NO?

30:51.417 --> 30:53.519
I'M NOT GONNA LIE
TO YOU.

30:53.552 --> 30:55.421
IS THIS REVENGE?

30:55.454 --> 30:58.190
I DON'T KNOW.

30:58.224 --> 30:59.591
BUT I DO KNOW
THAT IT'S SOMETHING

30:59.625 --> 31:02.628
I NEED RIGHT NOW.

31:26.152 --> 31:27.519
BUT I'LL BE FIRST-TIME.

31:29.455 --> 31:33.592

31:43.502 --> 31:45.371
YOUR KNOWLEDGE
OF NEW JERSEY DIVORCE LAW

31:45.404 --> 31:47.006
MADE ME SUSPICIOUS,
SO I LOOKED IT UP.

31:51.143 --> 31:53.479

31:57.216 --> 31:59.651
YOU LIED TO ME,
I FORGIVE YOU.

32:07.059 --> 32:10.129

32:18.470 --> 32:20.539
NO, I WAS THINKING...

32:22.474 --> 32:23.742
I MEAN,
IF THOSE TWO

32:23.775 --> 32:26.378
EVEN HAVE THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE
OF MAKING IT,

32:26.412 --> 32:29.115
THEN WE HAVE TO BE
A SURE THING.

32:29.148 --> 32:32.551

ALL OUR MISTAKES.

32:54.540 --> 32:56.442

WHAT TO SAY.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.277
I HAVE A SUGGESTION.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.046

COME FROM?

ABOUT THE FILES.

33:29.275 --> 33:31.510

I KNOW.

33:31.543 --> 33:34.113

33:34.146 --> 33:35.647

I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

THAT MEANS YOU'RE MISERABLE.

38:42.053 --> 38:47.426
IT MEANS
I'M HAPPY.

38:47.459 --> 38:49.127
IT DOESN'T MEAN
GOD DOESN'T EXIST.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.397
IT JUST MEANS HE'S--
HE'S TRULY MERCIFUL.

38:51.430 --> 38:55.701

WAS RIGHT.

38:59.070 --> 39:02.040

IS PROOF OF GOD?

INGENIOUS ARGUMENT.

39:03.975 --> 39:07.779

41:22.180 --> 41:25.951
I GOT THIS ARGUMENT
STUCK IN MY HEAD.

41:25.984 --> 41:29.721
IF EVERYBODY LIES,
THEN TRUST IS NOT ONLY UNFOUNDED

41:29.755 --> 41:32.958

IT'S FICTIONAL.

41:32.991 --> 41:35.727

IS NOT AN ARGUMENT
