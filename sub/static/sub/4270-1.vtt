00:18.844 --> 00:20.552
<i>- Hello.
- Hello.</i>

00:23.015 --> 00:24.215
My name is William.

00:28.396 --> 00:32.560
- Did they tell you what happened?
- My mom and daddy died.

00:32.674 --> 00:36.462
That's right, does that bother you?

00:37.029 --> 00:39.560
People die all the time.

00:41.442 --> 00:43.704
That's a good way
to look at it.

00:55.665 --> 00:57.987
Do you know
what that is?

00:59.176 --> 01:00.576
Can you do it?

01:24.485 --> 01:26.030
Wonderful.

01:29.999 --> 01:32.108
Veronica,

01:33.085 --> 01:36.364
can you remember the first
house you ever lived in?

01:37.715 --> 01:39.541
Close your eyes.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.118
I want you to
take me there.

01:43.929 --> 01:46.449
<i>Can you picture the
outside of the house?</i>

01:48.767 --> 01:50.754
Picture going to
the front door.

01:51.145 --> 01:53.881
How many steps is it from
there to your bedroom?

01:56.784 --> 01:58.450
Seventeen.

01:59.904 --> 02:01.580
<i>Stay there for me.</i>

02:02.781 --> 02:06.083
How many steps is it from
your bed to your bathroom?

02:08.537 --> 02:09.854
Six.

02:10.131 --> 02:11.553
<i>Okay.</i>

02:12.708 --> 02:14.660
<i>Keep your eyes closed.</i>

02:15.794 --> 02:18.063
Are you standing in
your bathroom right now?

02:20.382 --> 02:21.990
<i>What do you see?</i>

02:22.510 --> 02:23.894
Toothbrush.

02:24.303 --> 02:26.784
<i>- What color is it</i> ?
- Green.

02:27.473 --> 02:31.459
- Anything else?
- Toothpaste with baking soda peroxide whitening.

02:32.436 --> 02:36.431
- And?
- A mirror, a hairbrush,

02:36.481 --> 02:39.150
floss, a blue towel
and a yellow bathrobe.

02:39.318 --> 02:40.645
That's enough.

02:47.785 --> 02:49.601
You can open
your eyes now.

02:51.455 --> 02:52.688
How did I do?

02:54.091 --> 02:56.372
Well, you were perfect.

03:01.215 --> 03:04.449
- Veronica, would you like to come with me?
- Where?

03:05.344 --> 03:08.401
To a place where I would teach you things.
You like learning things, don't you?

03:08.494 --> 03:10.280
What kind of things?

03:11.016 --> 03:14.239
I would be training you
for a very important job.

03:14.311 --> 03:17.943
- What kinda job?
- The kind most people can't handle.

03:18.440 --> 03:21.132
You have to be very
special to do it.

03:21.235 --> 03:24.680
- How did you get YOUR job?
- Well, I volunteered.

03:24.738 --> 03:25.618
Why?

03:27.241 --> 03:32.550
Because a very bad man...
killed my wife and my daughter.

03:33.289 --> 03:34.935
Can I have ice cream?

03:36.584 --> 03:39.400
You can have
all you can eat.

04:15.914 --> 04:17.353
<i>Keep standin' there.</i>

04:21.795 --> 04:24.714
You need to know what it's like
to not be able to feel your feet.

04:26.884 --> 04:29.048
<i>You'll be chasin'
these boys through the woods</i>

04:29.098 --> 04:31.216
<i>in the middle of the
night with no shoes on...</i>

04:31.472 --> 04:32.936
cold and wet.

04:37.061 --> 04:38.995
You must avoid the water.

04:41.148 --> 04:44.725
If you get into a fight in the water,
it doesn't matter how tough you are.

04:45.361 --> 04:48.863
- Why can't I just shoot them?
- You want to shoot 'em?

04:49.907 --> 04:51.747
Yeah, it seems easier.

04:52.701 --> 04:54.160
Yeah, okay.

05:03.504 --> 05:04.896
Shoot me.

05:06.632 --> 05:08.523
I'm not gonna shoot you.

05:09.718 --> 05:11.216
Come on, shoot me.

05:13.055 --> 05:14.382
<i>Are you scared?</i>

05:15.808 --> 05:17.762
I don't want to kill you.

05:17.935 --> 05:19.397
Then wound me.

05:22.773 --> 05:24.192
It's an order.

05:37.913 --> 05:40.239
You see, the problem with guns are...

05:42.584 --> 05:44.377
you run out of bullets.

05:44.878 --> 05:46.374
What are you gonna do?

05:46.424 --> 05:48.939
I got all this,
whadda you got?

05:49.091 --> 05:51.026
<i>Do ya know what a gun
is without bullets?</i>

05:51.760 --> 05:53.828
Just a paperweight.

05:55.013 --> 05:56.229
Come on.

06:09.111 --> 06:10.700
No, I'm good.

06:21.999 --> 06:24.289
It's eight miles
back to the car.

06:24.793 --> 06:27.173
If you run,
you might make it back before dark.

07:03.123 --> 07:06.597
- Who's that girl?
- That is the new waitress.

07:06.752 --> 07:08.267
Her name's Gwen.

07:11.131 --> 07:12.374
<i>It's not bad.</i>

07:12.424 --> 07:13.641
<i>And a blonde.</i>

07:18.138 --> 07:20.480
What's this obsession
with blondes?

07:24.102 --> 07:25.476
It's just his type.

07:42.329 --> 07:43.800
What did I miss?

07:46.041 --> 07:48.049
As human beings we are free.

07:49.586 --> 07:52.796
Free to love, to hate,
to fight...

07:52.965 --> 07:54.203
to kill.

07:55.801 --> 07:59.008
This freedom is found in every
living person on this planet.

07:59.137 --> 08:01.747
There's no one person more
powerful than the other.

08:02.140 --> 08:05.612
Only the one with the most
will is the strongest.

08:05.853 --> 08:08.852
Height, weight,
physical appearance...

08:08.902 --> 08:10.567
none of these things matter.

08:11.024 --> 08:13.988
The only thing that
matters is your mind.

08:14.319 --> 08:16.248
The question then becomes,

08:16.530 --> 08:21.328
are you the type of person who
can summon their power... at will?

08:25.038 --> 08:29.898
This is a Ranger choke-hold, you will lose
consciousness in 20 seconds! Defend yourself!

08:30.711 --> 08:32.207
Defend yourself!

08:37.342 --> 08:38.919
What did you do wrong?

08:42.931 --> 08:45.306
I didn't... unify myself.

08:45.356 --> 08:48.889
No, once that happens,
it's too late to defend yourself. Stand up!

08:50.105 --> 08:51.504
Move.

08:53.692 --> 08:54.963
Now...

08:55.485 --> 08:57.263
Choke me.

09:01.325 --> 09:03.485
- How hard?
- As hard as you can.

09:03.827 --> 09:06.407
Once you get a hold of me,
do not let go, not for a second,

09:06.580 --> 09:08.660
until you feel the life
leave my body.

09:08.832 --> 09:10.015
Go!

09:11.335 --> 09:12.602
Harder.

09:31.813 --> 09:33.081
William?

09:33.374 --> 09:34.434
William?

09:34.593 --> 09:36.351
Hey! Hey! William!

09:43.817 --> 09:45.479
Oh! My god!

09:46.787 --> 09:48.281
It was perfect.

09:51.917 --> 09:55.219
<i>These boys know how to fight,
and they know how to kill.</i>

09:57.214 --> 10:00.885
<i>They will be bigger than you.
They will outnumber you.</i>

10:01.218 --> 10:02.712
<i>They will be armed.</i>

10:03.178 --> 10:05.178
<i>They will know the terrain,
and you will not.</i>

10:05.305 --> 10:07.698
<i>You must be smarter than them,
and faster.</i>

10:07.933 --> 10:10.357
<i>And when the moment comes,
you must not hesitate.</i>

10:11.561 --> 10:13.930
<i>I want you to look them in the eyes,
Veronica.</i>

10:15.607 --> 10:19.582
<i>Make your face
the last thing they see.</i>

10:23.031 --> 10:24.838
Sixteen and a half.

10:30.497 --> 10:31.920
Are you ready?

10:32.249 --> 10:33.588
For what?

10:34.459 --> 10:36.092
The time of your life.

10:37.879 --> 10:38.988
Let's go.

10:47.556 --> 10:49.191
Who's it gonna be?

10:50.726 --> 10:53.045
Brown sweater at the
corner of the bar.

11:13.540 --> 11:14.290
Hello.

11:14.750 --> 11:16.580
- How ya doin'?
- I'm well.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.928
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

11:19.171 --> 11:20.921
<i>Can you show me where the restroom is?</i>

11:42.870 --> 11:46.106
- Do you like it rough?
- You have no idea.

12:01.755 --> 12:03.898
- Not bad.
- Not bad?

12:08.762 --> 12:10.809
You get some control
over yourself.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.634
- How did I end up on...
- On the floor?

12:13.767 --> 12:16.013
You followed my girlfriend
here into the bathroom.

12:16.353 --> 12:18.406
<i>You tried to kiss her,
and she fought you off,</i>

12:18.503 --> 12:19.903
then you fell.

12:22.025 --> 12:23.730
Sorry.

13:49.613 --> 13:53.001
My head hurts,
can I take an aspirin or something?

13:55.160 --> 13:56.257
No.

13:57.495 --> 13:59.348
Can I lay down next to you?

14:00.832 --> 14:02.374
You have your own bed

14:03.752 --> 14:05.807
I know, but I'm cold.

14:17.974 --> 14:19.412
There.

14:27.651 --> 14:29.842
- Is that better?
- Much.

14:33.740 --> 14:35.261
We can't do this.

14:36.326 --> 14:40.385
- But, you're my trainer.
- That's right.

14:40.705 --> 14:42.410
So, take me.

14:45.210 --> 14:47.758
Don't you find
me attractive?

14:51.216 --> 14:53.145
Who wouldn't?

14:53.426 --> 14:54.851
So?

14:55.262 --> 14:56.400
No.

14:59.057 --> 15:00.656
Fine.

15:20.996 --> 15:22.121
What's that?

15:24.040 --> 15:26.550
This is my own, little,
chaos cocktail.

15:27.669 --> 15:29.494
It's one part sodium pentothal,

15:30.046 --> 15:31.400
Truth serum.

15:32.966 --> 15:34.114
<i>What else?</i>

15:34.342 --> 15:37.228
One part DMT.

15:37.470 --> 15:40.409
- Dimethyltryptamine
- Very good.

15:41.891 --> 15:45.101
Isn't that the shit that
makes LSD look like Kool-Aid?

15:47.605 --> 15:49.409
What'll it do to me?

15:50.525 --> 15:55.187
You will come face to face with
your greatest, deepest fears.

15:55.237 --> 15:57.676
- I'm not afraid of anything.
- Oh, really?

15:57.782 --> 16:00.468
That would make
you not human.

16:02.120 --> 16:04.464
- I think that you're...
- Stop! Okay!

16:04.622 --> 16:07.559
- Oh, yeah, oh, look, you're human.
- Okay! Okay!

16:10.462 --> 16:13.932
- How long does it last?
- This dose, about an hour.

16:13.965 --> 16:15.755
It'll feel more
like a day to you.

16:22.974 --> 16:26.509
In about half an hour,
you're gonna start to feel superhuman.

16:26.686 --> 16:28.846
Is this for my
protection or yours?

16:29.522 --> 16:30.928
Mine.

16:32.901 --> 16:34.680
You will see the truth.

18:12.959 --> 18:14.211
William?

18:14.544 --> 18:16.992
<i>Ever since I met you I
knew this day would come.</i>

18:19.299 --> 18:20.974
What are you talking about?

18:21.024 --> 18:23.014
You failed, Veronica.

18:23.261 --> 18:24.481
What?

18:24.637 --> 18:26.210
You will not make it.

18:26.264 --> 18:30.864
All these years, <i>the money,
resources spent...</i>

18:31.769 --> 18:33.205
<i>wasted.</i>

18:33.255 --> 18:37.267
- What can I do?
- Nothing, it's too late.

18:37.817 --> 18:40.657
- No, please, William, don't do this.
- I have no choice.

18:40.695 --> 18:42.182
Please let me go.

18:42.489 --> 18:43.997
I wish I could.

18:44.282 --> 18:45.772
Goodbye, Veronica.

18:46.075 --> 18:47.616
But I love you!

19:09.766 --> 19:11.629
Where did you go?

19:13.144 --> 19:14.847
<i>A man was attacking me.</i>

19:15.396 --> 19:17.138
<i>You shot him, and then...</i>

19:17.188 --> 19:20.079
I was here...
on the table.

19:21.110 --> 19:22.585
Then I woke up.

19:23.279 --> 19:25.096
I failed the program.

19:26.157 --> 19:28.147
- Then...
- Then what?

19:28.201 --> 19:29.831
Then you killed me.

19:31.412 --> 19:34.722
Would you really?
<i>If you had to?</i>

19:39.879 --> 19:41.639
You know the answer.

19:43.466 --> 19:45.235
Don't make me say it.

19:49.097 --> 19:51.467
I gave this to you for two reasons,
what are they?

19:51.683 --> 19:54.023
To know how scared
I am of you?

19:54.894 --> 19:56.314
No.

19:56.646 --> 20:00.780
You have to remain sharp and focused
at all times under any condition.

20:03.111 --> 20:04.851
You have to know how to fight,

20:05.113 --> 20:09.353
when you are tired, cold,
hot, sleep deprived,

20:09.403 --> 20:10.477
and hallucinating.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.938
You're now ready for the final test,
Veronica.

20:13.454 --> 20:15.225
I wanted you to know how
it would feel if your

20:15.275 --> 20:17.478
opponent had had
this cocktail and you hadn't.

20:19.252 --> 20:22.183
When am I ever gonna be
facing someone more selfish?

20:35.768 --> 20:37.287
How many?

20:39.022 --> 20:40.532
How many what?

20:41.399 --> 20:43.134
<i>How many girls have they killed?</i>

20:43.943 --> 20:46.516
Ten.
Maybe a dozen.

20:47.030 --> 20:50.566
And another local girl,
Gwen Thomas went missing a few days ago.

20:56.205 --> 20:58.067
<i>One of them has a girlfriend.</i>

21:03.171 --> 21:05.019
Why does that surprise you?

21:07.717 --> 21:10.012
They just don't
seem to like women.

21:10.887 --> 21:14.963
<i>They don't like anybody, really...
incapable of empathy.</i>

21:15.433 --> 21:17.291
But they can fake it.

21:17.518 --> 21:19.768
A girlfriend's a perfect cover.

21:19.937 --> 21:22.041
You'd think she'd
smell it on him.

21:22.690 --> 21:24.953
<i>Love is also based
on deception.</i>

21:26.653 --> 21:29.692
<i>He tells her he loves her and </i> buys
her to lunch every once in a while.

21:29.989 --> 21:33.744
<i>It's different with her,
the other girls are just trophies.</i>

21:34.994 --> 21:37.467
They've been together
since they were fourteen.

21:39.457 --> 21:41.772
Some marriages don't
last that long.

21:43.878 --> 21:45.473
Mine didn't.

22:04.273 --> 22:05.565
Where are you going?

22:05.858 --> 22:08.033
A fact finding mission...

22:08.778 --> 22:10.612
with French fries.

22:18.538 --> 22:20.191
<i>Is this seat taken?</i>

22:21.249 --> 22:22.839
Hel... help yourself.

22:27.755 --> 22:29.415
How are the shakes here?

22:30.591 --> 22:32.113
They're delicious.

22:33.678 --> 22:35.494
Vanilla or chocolate?

22:36.347 --> 22:38.152
I'm a vanilla girl.

22:38.599 --> 22:40.481
You should give
yourself more credit.

22:43.396 --> 22:44.066
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:44.116 --> 22:47.988
Two vanilla shakes, please,
and a large frie to go, thanks.

22:49.402 --> 22:52.193
Do you often do the
milkshakes with strangers?

22:52.243 --> 22:55.948
Actually no, but I finally live
here and I figured, "Why not?"

22:55.998 --> 22:59.661
Guess I didn't have anyone to talk to,
and you didn't look like you did either.

23:00.413 --> 23:03.976
- Unless I'm interrupting something?
- No.

23:04.625 --> 23:06.016
Not at all.

23:07.086 --> 23:08.327
Thanks.

23:16.554 --> 23:19.258
You know,
it may be none of my business, but...

23:20.516 --> 23:22.317
you look a little sad.

23:22.518 --> 23:24.103
I'm fine, really.

23:29.525 --> 23:31.534
Ya know,
it's a little know law,

23:31.903 --> 23:35.697
that it's a crime to be sad while
having a milkshake, you know that?

23:36.491 --> 23:39.719
I wouldn't want to break
any obscure milkshake laws..

23:45.082 --> 23:50.384
Would this milkshake-proof sadness be,
in any way, boy related?

23:51.464 --> 23:53.364
I'm a 17 years old girl.

23:53.549 --> 23:55.516
Of course it's boy related.

23:55.566 --> 23:58.039
- Tell me about it.
- You don't want to hear about that.

23:58.429 --> 24:01.518
No, I do, really,
I'm all ears.

24:10.066 --> 24:12.805
- Ya know, it's torture.
- What?

24:16.697 --> 24:19.790
Knowing you could love someone
if he'd just let you.

24:22.703 --> 24:24.953
Sometimes I feel
like such a fool.

24:25.003 --> 24:26.228
Why is that?

24:32.880 --> 24:36.378
He's just so... unavailable.

24:39.554 --> 24:43.009
Sometimes I wonder if my boyfriend
loves me or his friends more.

24:44.559 --> 24:46.052
What are they like?

24:47.562 --> 24:50.438
Like...
like a pack of wolves.

24:50.982 --> 24:54.010
One steak away from tearing
each other to shreds.

25:00.241 --> 25:02.281
Do you ever wish you
could just take off?

25:02.702 --> 25:06.929
Ya know, when you find everything
and everyone you ever knew?

25:08.165 --> 25:09.993
Yeah, once or twice.

25:10.418 --> 25:12.032
If I went...

25:12.503 --> 25:15.736
- I'd never come back.
- Then what's stopping you?

25:19.051 --> 25:21.866
- You know...? - Him! - No.

25:24.223 --> 25:25.294
It's you.

25:28.561 --> 25:33.153
Thanks, um, here, keep the change.

25:35.902 --> 25:39.823
Look, I'm...
really not big on rules.

25:40.323 --> 25:41.965
I do have one.

25:42.533 --> 25:43.828
What's that?

25:44.827 --> 25:48.633
Live today like you're
gonna die tomorrow.

25:48.873 --> 25:51.156
Things work out a
lot better that way.

25:57.632 --> 25:59.500
Well,
it was lovely to meet you.

26:04.513 --> 26:05.946
Thank you.

26:06.974 --> 26:08.249
Really!

26:10.978 --> 26:12.809
It was just a shake.

26:28.287 --> 26:29.254
Well?

26:29.304 --> 26:31.522
Well, that place makes
a damn good shake.

26:34.418 --> 26:37.018
And then, what did you find out
new about your targets?

26:38.422 --> 26:40.197
They're falling apart.

26:44.720 --> 26:46.296
I'm going to enjoy this.

26:48.557 --> 26:50.128
When do we get started?

26:52.019 --> 26:54.364
It's not like that this time.

26:55.189 --> 26:57.596
You're gonna have to
do this mission alone.

27:19.922 --> 27:21.342
Is this seat taken?

27:23.092 --> 27:24.665
Just by you.

27:30.766 --> 27:33.143
My God, you are beautiful.

27:34.311 --> 27:38.675
- How is it that I've never seen you before?
- Maybe because I just moved to town.

27:38.725 --> 27:39.773
Is that right?

27:40.693 --> 27:42.930
- Do you know anybody?
- Just you.

27:44.238 --> 27:46.819
And the lady that
brought me my shake.

27:47.366 --> 27:49.779
- She's a bitch.
- Is she?

27:52.496 --> 27:54.155
But it looks delicious.

28:18.189 --> 28:20.569
- Up to your standards?
- I've had better.

28:20.633 --> 28:23.663
Then, please,
I'd like to know where.

28:24.528 --> 28:26.250
What are you doing
Saturday night?

28:26.655 --> 28:29.106
- Washing my hair.
- No, you're doing that Friday night.

28:29.325 --> 28:30.568
Oh, am I?

28:30.618 --> 28:33.169
Saturday night,
you meet me here at eight o'clock.

28:34.538 --> 28:36.379
With clean hair,

28:38.542 --> 28:40.388
and red lipstick.

28:40.438 --> 28:43.124
And where exactly are we going,

28:43.174 --> 28:47.420
that I need to have clean hair,
and red lipstick?

28:47.676 --> 28:49.648
You promise not to tell anybody?

28:50.054 --> 28:50.644
Maybe.

28:51.430 --> 28:53.272
We're going to another world.

28:53.432 --> 28:54.704
Good.

28:55.976 --> 28:58.310
'Cause I'm very bored of this one.

28:59.522 --> 29:00.822
Me too.

29:07.196 --> 29:08.568
Don't be late.

29:53.033 --> 29:54.280
Here.

29:58.289 --> 29:59.947
What do you guys
do out there?

30:01.792 --> 30:03.533
Nothing special.

30:03.961 --> 30:07.321
- Dressed like that?
- We hunt.

30:11.051 --> 30:12.597
How do I look?

30:14.013 --> 30:15.489
Incredible.

30:26.025 --> 30:27.345
I love you.

30:47.588 --> 30:49.493
Jenny givin' you shit?

30:49.543 --> 30:50.937
Yep, like always.

30:52.718 --> 30:54.595
It's the story of your life.

30:58.557 --> 31:00.672
You got enough steak,
my darling?

31:01.227 --> 31:03.750
I did, Mom,
it was wonderful.

31:04.104 --> 31:07.404
- I'm so glad.
- Well, you're such a good cook.

31:08.567 --> 31:10.877
I bet Dad misses your food.

31:12.238 --> 31:15.318
I'm sure it's better than what
they serve in the mess hall.

31:18.118 --> 31:19.988
Are the boys picking you up?

31:21.705 --> 31:23.616
Any minute now.

31:24.458 --> 31:26.387
<i>Do you have time for ice cream?</i>

31:26.669 --> 31:28.872
There's always
time for ice cream.

31:44.061 --> 31:45.360
Damn!

31:46.313 --> 31:48.510
Sorry, I was enjoying this.

31:49.775 --> 31:52.283
You know the best part
about an ice cream cone?

31:52.361 --> 31:53.633
What's that?

31:53.946 --> 31:55.782
You can take it anywhere.

32:10.504 --> 32:12.372
Your Mom not coming?

33:11.023 --> 33:15.680
Who's the beautiful broad piece of tits snatch
you got hooked up for us this time, man?

33:16.195 --> 33:18.458
She prettier than the last time?

33:19.156 --> 33:21.456
Well, I know how you like surprises,
Teddy.

33:21.742 --> 33:23.669
Just gotta wait and see.

33:24.620 --> 33:25.750
Let's go hunting, boys.

33:56.485 --> 33:57.913
Are you ready?

33:58.320 --> 33:59.896
As I'll ever be.

34:20.217 --> 34:21.266
Boys.

34:22.719 --> 34:25.167
Are you guys an
a cappella group?

34:26.723 --> 34:29.683
- Something like that.
- Naw, we don't sing together.

34:29.893 --> 34:31.286
You should.

34:33.230 --> 34:34.659
This is Shane,

34:35.315 --> 34:38.772
Daniel, or "Danny Boy",
and Nelson.

34:38.822 --> 34:40.045
Hello, boys.

34:40.154 --> 34:43.085
- I'm Veronica.
- Veronica...

34:43.657 --> 34:46.693
- Do your eyes hurt?
- No.

34:47.494 --> 34:49.646
Because they're killin' me.

34:50.813 --> 34:53.215
Now, no sense letting a pretty
girl like this get wet.

34:53.264 --> 34:55.983
C'mon, let's get you, Veronica,
right here inside this car.

34:56.085 --> 34:58.213
There ya go, sweetheart,
just sit right there,

34:58.266 --> 35:01.267
make yourself comfortable,
watch your hand, okay.

35:03.969 --> 35:06.242
What, are you trying to creep
her out before we get there?

35:07.431 --> 35:08.726
Cool it. man.

35:28.952 --> 35:30.882
So, WHERE are we going?

35:31.371 --> 35:33.052
I already told you.

35:34.291 --> 35:36.061
To another world.

35:36.111 --> 35:37.823
Will there be
other girls there?

35:39.546 --> 35:40.988
Lots.

35:42.016 --> 35:43.806
Please introduce me.

35:43.967 --> 35:47.935
You're gonna love my friend Annabelle,
she's to die for.

35:49.515 --> 35:50.542
I can't wait to meet her.

35:50.592 --> 35:52.345
She's great,
but she can get under your skin.

35:52.518 --> 35:54.908
Yeah, she can be
a little edgy at times.

35:55.437 --> 35:57.199
She's to the point.

35:58.482 --> 36:01.410
Veronica's new in town,
she doesn't know anybody.

36:01.485 --> 36:02.605
So you boys play nice.

36:02.861 --> 36:05.451
Hey, Veronica,
you ever play baseball?

36:05.864 --> 36:07.954
Softball, years ago, though.

36:08.116 --> 36:10.002
So, you know how
to hold a bat, then?

36:10.577 --> 36:12.327
Not very well, but, yes.

36:12.663 --> 36:14.833
Just remember to line up
you knuckles and choke up.

36:14.998 --> 36:16.863
All right, batters up!

36:18.541 --> 36:20.245
Swing batter, batter!
Swing batter!

36:21.880 --> 36:24.326
You get it!
You get it, son!

36:30.305 --> 36:32.493
Get that shit! Get that shit!
Get it!

36:40.816 --> 36:42.047
Impressive.

36:42.192 --> 36:43.688
All right, boys,
who's next?

36:45.112 --> 36:48.026
So, whaddya think,
can she handle it?

36:50.117 --> 36:52.210
I don't know.
Can you?

37:00.544 --> 37:01.826
<i>All right, you ready?</i>

37:02.212 --> 37:03.929
Here we go!

37:05.382 --> 37:06.222
Strike one!

37:06.592 --> 37:07.881
I wasn't ready.

37:07.931 --> 37:11.263
Try it again! Bases loaded! Let's do it!
<i>Let's do it, it this time, sweetheart!</i>

37:11.888 --> 37:13.531
One more try.

37:13.724 --> 37:15.684
All right, right there!
Hold on tight!

37:16.268 --> 37:20.423
Go, go, go on!
<i>Ready... 1, 2, 3... Swing!</i>

37:23.400 --> 37:25.337
- Wade swinging!
- Well said!

37:25.387 --> 37:26.940
That good looking babe's
gonna open the letter!

37:26.987 --> 37:28.408
<i>Or a baseball.</i>

37:28.722 --> 37:30.530
Well, you're right.

37:30.907 --> 37:34.141
Well added, that does make more sense,
ya see, it was a mailbox.

37:37.581 --> 37:39.553
I'm impressed.

37:40.542 --> 37:41.652
Thank you.

37:41.918 --> 37:44.357
What's the verdict, boys?
Huh?

37:44.504 --> 37:48.175
- One helluva woman!
- She can swing a bat, that for sure.

37:49.718 --> 37:52.112
Yeah, I guess we'll keep
you around a little longer.

37:52.262 --> 37:53.707
I suppose.

37:55.098 --> 37:56.552
Thank you.

37:58.268 --> 37:59.832
Are we almost there?

38:00.270 --> 38:01.929
Just about.

38:05.067 --> 38:06.857
I hope it's
worth the wait.

38:08.654 --> 38:10.038
It will be.

38:11.365 --> 38:12.718
Trust me.

38:44.773 --> 38:46.551
Are we the first ones here?

38:47.526 --> 38:49.047
We always are.

38:50.195 --> 38:53.848
I'm a little underdressed,
I mean it's pretty cold outside.

38:54.449 --> 38:56.037
You're perfect.

38:56.702 --> 38:58.013
C'mon!

38:59.705 --> 39:01.959
Veronica!

39:03.625 --> 39:05.711
<i>Veronica!</i>

39:30.360 --> 39:32.343
Relax.

39:32.393 --> 39:33.597
You'll love it here.

39:39.453 --> 39:40.998
You sit right there.

40:05.145 --> 40:06.763
So, what now?

40:07.647 --> 40:09.209
Whaddya mean?

40:10.609 --> 40:12.845
Whadda you guys
normally do out here?

40:14.237 --> 40:18.708
We talk, tell stories, play games.

40:19.451 --> 40:20.331
<i>Veronica...</i>

40:21.369 --> 40:25.040
<i>- wouldn't you like to play a game?</i>
- Absolutely.

40:25.665 --> 40:28.699
But first,
does anyone want a drink?

40:49.773 --> 40:52.040
Sure,
are you ready for a game.

40:52.692 --> 40:55.383
- It depends on the game.
- Truth or Dare.

40:55.862 --> 40:57.517
It's my favorite.

40:57.781 --> 40:59.798
Well, we play this game
a little differently.

40:59.860 --> 41:02.700
You pick a dare out of
the bag that Daniel has,

41:03.578 --> 41:06.933
<i>you choose truth,</i>
or you do the dare.

41:07.457 --> 41:10.401
BUT, if you pick the same dare twice,
you have to do it.

41:10.451 --> 41:12.025
'Kay.

41:19.386 --> 41:20.789
Truth.

41:22.138 --> 41:24.272
The worst thing
you've ever done?

41:38.071 --> 41:40.048
The first time I
ever went hunting.

41:40.365 --> 41:42.852
- What were you after?
- Rabbits.

41:43.618 --> 41:46.614
I was 10 when my dad
gave me my first 22.

41:47.539 --> 41:49.334
It was a big deal...

41:49.541 --> 41:51.744
our first hunt together.

41:53.503 --> 41:56.403
I was already a pretty good shot, so,
when I saw the rabbit, I nailed it.

41:59.009 --> 42:01.372
But I hadn't quite
finished the job.

42:02.470 --> 42:04.862
<i>I hit it in its hind quarters,</i>

42:05.015 --> 42:08.530
so, it was limping,
and it kept going.

42:11.146 --> 42:12.883
So, my dad...

42:13.607 --> 42:15.508
pulled out his Buck Knife,

42:16.401 --> 42:18.690
tells me to go finish the job.

42:19.237 --> 42:23.477
I must've followed that thing
a quarter mile before I found it.

42:24.034 --> 42:25.742
He looked at me,

42:30.290 --> 42:33.631
and I made the stupid mistake
of looking back in his eyes.

42:36.338 --> 42:37.871
I couldn't do it.

42:39.674 --> 42:42.182
I put my dad's knife
back in my pocket,

42:42.232 --> 42:44.349
I went and left him there.

42:44.471 --> 42:47.686
I told my dad I left the rabbit in
the woods and I wanted to go home.

42:47.891 --> 42:49.279
What did he say?

42:51.686 --> 42:54.314
Never come home
empty handed.

42:57.525 --> 42:58.969
Now I'm done.

43:00.070 --> 43:01.550
That's the worst thing you've ever done?

43:01.666 --> 43:04.012
Yeah, I'm with Veronica on that one.

43:04.062 --> 43:05.617
The rabbit either
died of starvation,

43:06.451 --> 43:09.678
some nasty infection,

43:09.728 --> 43:11.241
<i>or was eaten by a wolf.</i>

43:11.498 --> 43:15.098
Because I was not man enough
to finish what I had started,

43:16.336 --> 43:18.713
that creature suffered needlessly.

43:21.758 --> 43:25.390
Just because you kill something,
doesn't mean it has to suffer.

43:30.350 --> 43:31.684
Your turn.

43:41.611 --> 43:43.026
Truth.

43:43.321 --> 43:45.172
The worst thing you've done.

43:48.868 --> 43:51.719
I once had the chance
to save someone's life,

43:53.456 --> 43:55.232
and I didn't.

43:56.042 --> 43:57.770
Details...

43:59.546 --> 44:01.655
and drink.

44:25.155 --> 44:26.132
So?

44:26.182 --> 44:28.378
I'm not drunk enough...
the truth.

44:28.428 --> 44:29.796
You made your dare.

44:30.702 --> 44:32.229
Kill something.

44:37.625 --> 44:38.989
That's easy.

44:48.219 --> 44:50.063
Oh! Do you really have to?

44:53.224 --> 44:55.065
A dare's a dare.

44:59.981 --> 45:01.238
Yummy.

45:02.108 --> 45:08.247
<i>That guy!</i> That guy, man! This guy,
right here!<i> God damn! Did you see that?</i>

45:08.782 --> 45:10.310
Delicious.

45:12.285 --> 45:14.061
Are you religious, Veronica?

45:14.996 --> 45:16.290
No.

45:17.123 --> 45:19.008
I ask a lot of
people that question.

45:19.793 --> 45:21.897
Some say, "Yes, very."

45:21.947 --> 45:24.077
Others, like you,
say, "No."

45:24.547 --> 45:28.445
Of the people in your group,
I would bet anything that,

45:28.885 --> 45:30.425
when death is coming,

45:31.387 --> 45:33.739
when their final
moments of life are...

45:34.099 --> 45:35.810
evaporating,

45:37.644 --> 45:40.091
every last one of them
will ask God to help.

45:41.898 --> 45:44.392
Then I'd probably disappoint you.

45:48.398 --> 45:52.754
Have you ever
heard of... Pissat, Veronica?

45:52.909 --> 45:54.254
No.

45:55.078 --> 45:59.930
Well, he's a...
he's a 16th century political satirist.

46:00.125 --> 46:01.709
And... and he said,

46:02.127 --> 46:07.243
that... that you could never
truly experience pleasure,

46:09.759 --> 46:11.735
without going through pain.

46:13.555 --> 46:17.067
Can you, please...
hit me?

46:22.021 --> 46:26.757
Come on, baby!
You gotta do a little better than that!

46:28.903 --> 46:30.750
Blackjack!

46:36.452 --> 46:39.450
So, when to the
other girls get here?

46:39.956 --> 46:41.516
I already told you.

46:42.125 --> 46:43.724
Is something wrong?

46:45.003 --> 46:47.713
No,
I just don't like being outnumbered.

46:48.256 --> 46:52.303
Oh, don't worry,
you'll be in good company soon enough, honey.

46:52.353 --> 46:53.892
Having fun, aren't we?

46:55.221 --> 46:56.785
Yeah.

47:05.440 --> 47:07.168
Kiss someone.

47:08.151 --> 47:09.756
Don't look at me.

47:09.903 --> 47:12.369
Please!
I'm not that type of a girl.

47:12.739 --> 47:15.135
Rules are rules.

47:41.392 --> 47:42.982
Your turn.

47:56.282 --> 47:57.932
Truth or dare?

47:59.619 --> 48:02.071
It's the second
time I drew this.

48:02.372 --> 48:04.845
Well, in that case,
you have to do the dare.

48:06.334 --> 48:08.884
- Nelson, your belt.
- Why does it have to be mine?

48:26.729 --> 48:29.439
Oh, I've had Manhattans
and I've had Old Fashions,

48:29.649 --> 48:33.574
but these are some strong
libations you've brought, Veronica.

48:34.529 --> 48:36.249
Nothin' but the best.

48:44.622 --> 48:46.387
So many choices.

48:49.168 --> 48:50.417
Truth.

48:50.467 --> 48:53.203
Again?
You're so honest.

48:55.341 --> 48:58.618
- I bet I can get you to drink.
- Try me.

48:58.928 --> 49:00.945
What happened to Gwen Thomas?

49:03.141 --> 49:05.881
I didn't know the girl.
Did you?

49:05.935 --> 49:06.805
Not in the least.

49:07.186 --> 49:08.806
I was so sad when
she went missing.

49:09.147 --> 49:10.943
Didn't she go to your school?

49:14.902 --> 49:17.366
- It's your turn.
- Don't you have to drink?

49:17.416 --> 49:18.795
I spoke the truth.

49:19.782 --> 49:21.657
I have no idea what
happened to her.

49:22.243 --> 49:23.497
Your turn.

49:23.547 --> 49:25.743
- I just went.
- I'm out.

49:26.748 --> 49:29.044
- Me, too.
- Me, too.

49:29.459 --> 49:31.384
Oh! A little help?

49:47.435 --> 49:49.859
- I'd like to go home.
- No.

49:50.355 --> 49:52.970
- You should take me home?
- We can start here.

49:54.484 --> 49:56.160
I don't care.

49:56.210 --> 49:57.839
Is this game not fun?

49:57.904 --> 49:59.631
Okay, we'll play a new one.

50:01.574 --> 50:03.361
I know what you're thinking.

50:03.411 --> 50:07.051
Don't worry about that, women don't
run very well after a sexual assault.

50:07.789 --> 50:09.905
And I want you to run, Veronica.

50:12.126 --> 50:14.010
You have 5 minutes.

50:17.173 --> 50:18.698
And then what?

50:20.385 --> 50:23.789
WE... hunt you down.

50:25.640 --> 50:27.220
Help! Help!
<i>Help me, please help me!</i>

50:30.477 --> 50:33.544
- Oh, God!
- Please God, save me!

50:33.594 --> 50:35.691
Save me!
Isn't somebody gonna save me?

50:37.402 --> 50:40.134
- Will you stop?
- Stop!

50:40.184 --> 50:41.149
Can anyone save me?

50:41.406 --> 50:43.936
We're in the woods,
nobody can hear you.

50:43.950 --> 50:45.638
Scream all you want.

50:53.251 --> 50:55.751
Please, please,
this isn't funny.

50:55.795 --> 50:57.418
No, it will be.

50:57.672 --> 50:59.714
When you're beggin' for your life.

51:03.511 --> 51:06.579
All right, boys,
shut your eyes and try to stay so.

51:09.976 --> 51:11.430
Now, Veronica...

51:11.894 --> 51:15.326
What's 360 degrees
divided by 4?

51:16.065 --> 51:18.343
- 90.
- 90.

51:18.526 --> 51:20.486
We'll often know which
direction you go,

51:20.653 --> 51:23.663
which means each of us will have
90 degrees of ground to cover.

51:23.781 --> 51:25.933
The farther you go,
the more land we have to track.

51:25.984 --> 51:28.405
Personally, I like your chances.

51:34.167 --> 51:36.558
But... you have to keep running.

51:38.254 --> 51:40.627
Five minutes.

51:45.470 --> 51:47.716
Run, rabbit.
Run!

51:57.398 --> 51:59.779
We'll give her, what,
4 more minutes?

52:01.786 --> 52:03.151
Ooh! Someone's a little antsy.

52:03.238 --> 52:04.986
If he's not waitin', I'm not.

52:05.198 --> 52:06.978
Don't forget the booze.

52:11.996 --> 52:13.767
Let the games begin.

52:38.564 --> 52:41.242
<i>There's no one person
more powerful that the other.</i>

52:41.609 --> 52:44.916
<i>Only the one with the
most will is the strongest.</i>

54:15.745 --> 54:18.816
Come on, you Babylonian whore!

54:31.218 --> 54:34.054
You Babylonian whore!

55:51.590 --> 55:53.012
Any luck?

55:56.053 --> 55:57.619
I'm goin' this way.

56:51.776 --> 56:53.241
Mom?

56:55.529 --> 56:56.679
Mom?

56:59.116 --> 57:01.073
Mom!

57:01.994 --> 57:03.273
<i>Nelson!</i>

57:04.288 --> 57:06.539
Mom?
Come on!

57:07.208 --> 57:08.865
Come on, cunt.

57:11.712 --> 57:16.118
I knew this day would come,
when you would then turn on me.

57:17.384 --> 57:20.179
You think you're so smart!

57:21.055 --> 57:23.081
I'm much smarter!

57:24.683 --> 57:25.865
Come on!

57:26.852 --> 57:32.178
Come on, you coward!
Come on! I'll fucking kill you!

57:47.289 --> 57:48.698
Come on!

58:03.806 --> 58:05.427
Show yourself!

58:09.937 --> 58:11.248
Where are you?

58:22.908 --> 58:25.671
That's it?
That's all you got?

58:26.120 --> 58:27.641
Come on!

58:55.733 --> 58:57.726
No, please.

58:59.486 --> 59:01.067
No!

59:08.871 --> 59:10.909
That's a really big rock.

59:11.832 --> 59:13.459
Nelson?

59:48.410 --> 59:50.560
Veronica!

59:51.580 --> 59:54.276
<i>Veronica!</i>

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:12.592
You are an interesting girl.

01:00:42.172 --> 01:00:43.793
Jamieson?

01:00:46.552 --> 01:00:48.309
What is this?

01:00:50.055 --> 01:00:51.351
Nothing.

01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:55.343
It's just a silly
joke Nelson and Danny play.

01:01:00.524 --> 01:01:01.812
What are you doing here?

01:01:02.109 --> 01:01:05.473
Looking for Shane.
Have you seen him?

01:01:06.572 --> 01:01:08.884
- He's hunting.
- In a tuxedo?

01:01:10.534 --> 01:01:13.088
It's important to
look your best.

01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:15.645
What do you guys
do out here?

01:01:17.583 --> 01:01:19.933
- How do I look?
- Good.

01:01:20.544 --> 01:01:21.220
Good.

01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:23.098
- You look good.
- He looks good.

01:01:23.172 --> 01:01:25.929
C'mon,
you can see better than that in me.

01:01:26.008 --> 01:01:28.403
Jamieson, you look great,
but, I'm not... I'm not gonna...

01:01:28.426 --> 01:01:31.040
But what, you feel differently... now?

01:01:31.090 --> 01:01:32.257
Yes.

01:01:37.644 --> 01:01:40.186
- Do you?
- Yes, I've moved on.

01:01:42.483 --> 01:01:44.231
Now you're happy with Shane?

01:01:45.277 --> 01:01:46.774
He's a good guy.

01:01:48.322 --> 01:01:52.993
But is he... a good... boyfriend?

01:01:58.749 --> 01:02:00.812
I don't wanna
make that mistake.

01:02:00.862 --> 01:02:01.876
You had your shot.

01:02:02.294 --> 01:02:04.464
- We were kids.
- We still are.

01:02:04.671 --> 01:02:06.424
That was years ago, I've evolved.

01:02:06.497 --> 01:02:09.432
So will I...
in another direction.

01:02:12.679 --> 01:02:14.026
Jenny,

01:02:16.809 --> 01:02:19.936
you're forgetting something
very important I used to tell you.

01:02:20.104 --> 01:02:21.663
What?

01:02:23.982 --> 01:02:26.086
We're all just animals.

01:02:28.487 --> 01:02:30.300
And we don't change.

01:02:55.589 --> 01:02:56.771
Jen!

01:02:57.724 --> 01:02:58.912
Shane!

01:03:00.227 --> 01:03:02.110
How could you do this?

01:03:02.646 --> 01:03:03.936
She compromised.

01:03:04.064 --> 01:03:06.851
- I'm so sorry, I just lost...
- Shut your mouth.

01:03:08.443 --> 01:03:11.317
- And you!
- I grandfathered in.

01:03:11.367 --> 01:03:14.215
- I was there first.
- You slept with him?

01:03:14.265 --> 01:03:16.932
It was so long ago I didn't
even know what we were doing.

01:03:17.494 --> 01:03:19.332
Well, I beg to differ.

01:03:25.669 --> 01:03:27.190
I suppose I deserve that.

01:03:28.714 --> 01:03:30.222
Shane, stop!

01:03:32.301 --> 01:03:34.539
- Does that make you feel better, buddy?
- No!

01:03:35.095 --> 01:03:40.508
I know I can't control what you two did
before we started dating, but why now?

01:03:40.726 --> 01:03:43.838
- To expose the truth.
- What truth?

01:03:45.522 --> 01:03:48.009
The one you've been running from,
Shane.

01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:51.940
People like us can't love.

01:03:51.987 --> 01:03:54.575
You've been fooling the world for so long,
you're starting to believe it.

01:03:54.823 --> 01:03:56.290
I do love her!

01:03:56.408 --> 01:03:58.134
No, you can't.

01:03:58.952 --> 01:04:01.752
<i>- What does he mean, "People like you"?</i>
- Nothing.

01:04:01.914 --> 01:04:03.924
Don't listen to a word
this asshole has to say.

01:04:04.082 --> 01:04:06.395
- She should know, Shane.
- Know what?

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:08.502
What we do here.

01:04:08.712 --> 01:04:11.655
- Go home, we'll talk in the morning.
- I wanna know!

01:04:11.882 --> 01:04:14.875
- It's time, Shane.
- What do you do out here?

01:04:15.093 --> 01:04:18.138
- We get drunk, tell stories.
- And then?

01:04:19.806 --> 01:04:24.063
Hunt girls like... you.

01:04:27.356 --> 01:04:29.817
- Shane?
- He's lying.

01:04:30.025 --> 01:04:33.515
I'm a lot of things, Jennifer,
but one think I am not...is a liar.

01:04:35.239 --> 01:04:36.782
You know Gwen Thomas?

01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:40.593
- She was in my homeroom.
- Yeah.

01:04:40.744 --> 01:04:42.552
We did it just over
the rise back there.

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:45.125
One shot, right to the chest.

01:04:45.175 --> 01:04:46.246
Don't.

01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:47.914
Don't believe him.

01:04:47.964 --> 01:04:51.578
We don't always use firearms, we like to mix up
our techniques, it throws off the authorities.

01:04:51.672 --> 01:04:54.470
This is all one big, tasteless joke.

01:04:56.551 --> 01:04:59.030
- Shane?
- I said, "Go!"

01:04:59.346 --> 01:05:01.244
Well, she's not going anywhere.

01:05:02.015 --> 01:05:03.878
She already knows too much, Shane.

01:05:06.436 --> 01:05:09.783
- Don't.
- If you're gonna shoot her, you have to shoot me.

01:05:11.149 --> 01:05:12.436
Fine.

01:05:44.057 --> 01:05:47.204
I'm so... sorry.

01:05:48.353 --> 01:05:50.816
Not everything
Jamieson said is true.

01:05:51.106 --> 01:05:52.642
I do love you.

01:05:54.568 --> 01:05:55.896
I always will.

01:06:02.743 --> 01:06:04.882
Shane!

01:08:06.074 --> 01:08:07.327
Fuck!

01:08:13.206 --> 01:08:14.970
<i>Bravo!</i>

01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:28.969
Bravo.

01:08:30.307 --> 01:08:34.318
Relax, relax,
I'm just admiring your work.

01:08:35.604 --> 01:08:38.346
Daniel, Nelson, now Shane.

01:08:38.523 --> 01:08:40.299
Very impressive, indeed.

01:08:43.153 --> 01:08:46.287
No, no, no, relax,
catch your breath, take a seat,

01:08:46.337 --> 01:08:48.767
I won't touch you
until you're ready.

01:09:01.712 --> 01:09:03.412
Shall we play a game?

01:09:05.675 --> 01:09:07.421
You and the games.

01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:09.841
So, here's how this works...

01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:14.421
I ask you a question, you answer it, you
ask me a question, then I answer it. Got it?

01:09:15.428 --> 01:09:16.908
Yeah, I think so.

01:09:17.354 --> 01:09:18.921
So...

01:09:19.981 --> 01:09:22.350
Why are my friends
tripping their balls off?

01:09:23.609 --> 01:09:27.000
Dimethyltryptamine,
mixed with sodium pentothal.

01:09:30.908 --> 01:09:32.339
Okay.

01:09:36.915 --> 01:09:38.185
Your turn.

01:09:41.962 --> 01:09:43.515
Ooh, this is exciting.

01:09:43.566 --> 01:09:45.508
- How many girls have you killed?
- Boring!

01:09:45.674 --> 01:09:48.783
You said I ask the question,
you have to answer it.

01:09:50.595 --> 01:09:52.191
Twenty-one including you.

01:09:52.206 --> 01:09:57.444
Oh, well, I think we're getting
a little ahead of ourselves now.

01:10:02.232 --> 01:10:04.572
How did it feel when
you killed my friends?

01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:10.673
- Fantastic.
- Oh, God, I'm in love!

01:10:15.787 --> 01:10:17.469
Shane's girlfriend?

01:10:18.123 --> 01:10:19.405
What about her?

01:10:20.292 --> 01:10:22.991
- Jennifer, right?
- Yes.

01:10:23.041 --> 01:10:26.467
- Do you know her?
- My question.

01:10:29.217 --> 01:10:30.876
Have you ever
slept with her?

01:10:32.679 --> 01:10:35.087
Indeed I have,
many times.

01:10:36.182 --> 01:10:37.568
It was lovely.

01:10:38.393 --> 01:10:39.686
Why do you ask?

01:10:41.646 --> 01:10:43.227
I was just wondering.

01:10:43.815 --> 01:10:46.310
Why do you ask?

01:10:47.569 --> 01:10:50.029
It was his deepest,
darkest fear.

01:10:50.196 --> 01:10:51.801
Kind of a Nazi

01:10:52.490 --> 01:10:56.636
Most people's biggest fears are on their
surface, just waiting to... pop out.

01:10:57.203 --> 01:10:59.636
What's waiting to pop out of you,
Jamieson?

01:11:01.416 --> 01:11:04.623
<i>What's your deepest,
darkest fear?</i>

01:11:06.338 --> 01:11:07.801
You got your breath?

01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:11.731
Yes... I have, thank you.

01:11:12.677 --> 01:11:13.518
Da!

01:11:15.930 --> 01:11:18.433
My deepest, darkest...

01:11:21.186 --> 01:11:22.593
You took that well.

01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:25.894
THAT for my friends.

01:11:27.567 --> 01:11:29.439
We don't have to
keep doing this.

01:11:31.905 --> 01:11:33.571
I think we do.

01:11:33.782 --> 01:11:35.079
Or...

01:11:35.158 --> 01:11:37.110
we could get married?

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:40.145
- Yeah, I don't see that happening.
- Oh, but I do!

01:11:40.538 --> 01:11:42.125
We'd be so happy together!

01:11:43.708 --> 01:11:46.115
Goin' town to town, killing people?

01:11:46.165 --> 01:11:47.967
Exactly!

01:11:50.632 --> 01:11:52.557
So, I'm just enjoying myself.

01:11:52.717 --> 01:11:54.157
All right,
let's fight.

01:12:38.263 --> 01:12:39.992
Jesus, you smell good.

01:13:55.548 --> 01:13:56.921
<i>Careful!</i>

01:13:57.967 --> 01:14:00.065
You don't wanna hang yourself,
do you?

01:14:03.306 --> 01:14:04.677
Let me down.

01:14:05.975 --> 01:14:07.818
Now, why would I do that?

01:14:10.730 --> 01:14:12.975
I'll never do this again,
I promise!

01:14:13.149 --> 01:14:14.960
Do what exactly?

01:14:15.652 --> 01:14:17.423
Hunt girls.

01:14:18.696 --> 01:14:20.538
I highly doubt that.

01:14:29.749 --> 01:14:31.459
I'll give you
anything you want.

01:14:31.668 --> 01:14:35.050
You know, this is starting to
feel like a game, Jamieson.

01:14:35.964 --> 01:14:38.614
And I know how much
you love games.

01:14:39.801 --> 01:14:41.781
<i>So, let's call this game...</i>

01:14:43.847 --> 01:14:45.559
"One Question".

01:14:46.975 --> 01:14:51.045
Because there's only one thing
that you have that I want.

01:14:51.187 --> 01:14:52.959
Can you guess what that is?

01:14:54.065 --> 01:14:56.641
- Fuck!
- Be careful!

01:14:58.319 --> 01:14:59.726
What?

01:15:00.196 --> 01:15:03.675
I have no idea,
but name it and it's yours.

01:15:05.493 --> 01:15:06.854
Your life.

01:15:09.372 --> 01:15:10.683
No.

01:15:11.165 --> 01:15:14.846
Please, don't.
Please don't.

01:15:14.896 --> 01:15:18.285
Have you ever noticed how people
try to strike bargains with you,

01:15:18.335 --> 01:15:20.379
instead of just
accepting their fate?

01:15:21.509 --> 01:15:23.679
Are you religious, Jamieson?

01:15:25.221 --> 01:15:26.330
No!

01:15:27.807 --> 01:15:31.179
- Are you gonna beg God to help you?
- No!

01:15:36.274 --> 01:15:38.760
- Maybe you should.
- Fuck you!

01:15:49.621 --> 01:15:53.142
Oh, shit.
No.

01:15:53.425 --> 01:15:56.006
<i>No, please stop!</i>

01:16:00.131 --> 01:16:03.393
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:16:09.307 --> 01:16:10.990
No way you wanna do it.

01:16:11.459 --> 01:16:13.178
<i>Please, please stop.</i>

01:16:18.107 --> 01:16:20.280
Make it stop!

01:16:25.782 --> 01:16:27.145
Make it stop.

01:16:28.576 --> 01:16:30.941
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

01:16:32.931 --> 01:16:35.225
<i>You're killing me,
get away from me!</i>

01:16:35.375 --> 01:16:38.108
Get away from me,
get away.

01:16:39.671 --> 01:16:44.303
Stop it! Stop!
Don't! Don't! Stop!

01:17:07.699 --> 01:17:09.184
Well done.

01:17:10.827 --> 01:17:12.891
Thank you.

01:17:15.456 --> 01:17:16.777
You okay?

01:17:19.085 --> 01:17:20.595
Never better.

01:17:55.371 --> 01:17:57.455
So, how's your pancakes?

01:18:06.299 --> 01:18:07.049
Temp.

01:18:09.552 --> 01:18:11.274
Mine, too.
