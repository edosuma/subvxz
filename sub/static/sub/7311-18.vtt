00:18.112 --> 00:20.295
Post up here
while I take care of business.

00:30.847 --> 00:31.973
Is that for me?

01:03.357 --> 01:04.357
Teek?

01:04.772 --> 01:05.684
Is that you?

01:05.744 --> 01:07.676
You got a decision to make, Tara.

01:07.757 --> 01:09.648
Do we walk out of here,

01:09.708 --> 01:11.216
or do I have to carry you?

01:42.936 --> 01:45.851
African-American male
in his late 40s.

01:46.006 --> 01:49.914
Despite his distended features
from time under the water,

01:50.091 --> 01:53.889
Chicago PD managed to identify
him as one

01:53.970 --> 01:55.764
Tyler Keith Owens.

01:55.845 --> 01:58.818
They fished him out of Lake Michigan...
two days ago.

01:58.878 --> 02:02.175
That is just hours before Director
Vance's departure with McGee and...

02:03.909 --> 02:06.476
Preliminary cause of death believed
to be multiple gunshot

02:06.536 --> 02:08.485
wounds to the chest and abdomen.

02:08.589 --> 02:10.863
He was shipped here
by the Chicago M.E.

02:10.943 --> 02:12.949
I've been asked to perform
the autopsy,

02:13.029 --> 02:14.743
by Leon Vance.

02:14.932 --> 02:16.338
His effects are up with Abby.

02:16.398 --> 02:18.580
Also at the request of Leon Vance.

02:18.752 --> 02:20.632
Leon Vance is working a case.

02:25.038 --> 02:26.524
Come on. Come on.

02:28.560 --> 02:30.349
Come on, this is ridiculous.

02:30.409 --> 02:31.801
Ziva, have you seen my...

02:33.166 --> 02:34.226
Probie, have you...

02:35.552 --> 02:37.097
You are with each other...

02:37.439 --> 02:39.184
in Chicago with Vance.

02:39.265 --> 02:40.727
I'm not in Chicago.

02:40.787 --> 02:43.267
Because I got to go to Arizona.
It has nothing to do with my...

02:43.707 --> 02:46.171
lack of prowess
on protective detail.

02:47.071 --> 02:48.071
Excuse me!

02:48.149 --> 02:49.527
Okay, listen up, everybody!

02:49.607 --> 02:51.404
I need your full attention here!

02:51.484 --> 02:53.448
Lenny, Squiggy, Q-tip,

02:53.529 --> 02:56.618
Q-Bert, Bungo Straits, Vertical Bill.
Can you hear me back there?

02:57.690 --> 02:58.989
Natalie, hi.

02:59.868 --> 03:02.540
You look very nice today.
I have lost my wallet.

03:03.017 --> 03:06.210
So, if you've seen it,
please return it to me.

03:06.291 --> 03:07.719
There will be no judgment.

03:07.779 --> 03:09.172
Maybe even a small reward.

03:16.760 --> 03:17.760
Hi, boss.

03:18.370 --> 03:19.370
I lost my...

03:21.222 --> 03:22.971
You're gonna say "mind"
or "marbles",

03:23.031 --> 03:24.770
- but, I lost my...
- Job?

03:26.117 --> 03:27.816
Have you heard from Ziva or McGee?

03:28.362 --> 03:29.362
Hold on.

03:30.191 --> 03:31.740
It's the prince of darkness himself.

03:31.800 --> 03:34.440
I'll be right up there, but Boss wants
to talk to you for a second.

03:38.052 --> 03:38.952
He hung up.

03:39.032 --> 03:42.213
He's setting up a videoconference
up in MTAC with... with Vance.

03:42.273 --> 03:43.273
Good. Let's go.

03:43.523 --> 03:45.994
Well, he just said me,
but I think we can... we all go.

03:49.042 --> 03:50.347
Where'd you hide my wallet?

03:50.770 --> 03:51.770
What?

03:52.492 --> 03:53.744
Hold on for the Director.

03:57.224 --> 03:59.013
DiNozzo,
I got an assignment for you.

03:59.207 --> 04:01.199
We're transporting
a key witness to DC.

04:01.259 --> 04:03.011
I want you to sit on her
till we get back.

04:03.071 --> 04:04.371
Witness to what, Director?

04:04.431 --> 04:07.188
We believe she's got information
relating to the murder of a Marine.

04:07.556 --> 04:10.278
Word gets out that we have her,
she could be in danger.

04:10.564 --> 04:12.694
Witness' name is Tara Kole.

04:13.243 --> 04:15.405
Her flight lands
at National in 40 minutes.

04:18.846 --> 04:20.702
Is that you I see lurking
in the background?

04:25.136 --> 04:27.028
You're conducting an investigation.

04:27.438 --> 04:31.415
I understand you might feel your toes
being stepped on, Agent Gibbs.

04:32.263 --> 04:34.424
Me handing out
assignments to your team.

04:34.610 --> 04:35.967
Not taking it personally.

04:36.048 --> 04:37.563
Are you suggesting I am?

04:37.675 --> 04:38.675
Are you?

04:40.740 --> 04:42.062
May I have the room, please.

04:49.808 --> 04:51.024
Both rooms.

04:57.424 --> 04:59.647
Tyler Owens disappeared
more than a week ago.

05:00.132 --> 05:01.712
And, yes, he was a friend.

05:02.183 --> 05:04.829
Local authorities haven't been able
to generate a single lead.

05:05.060 --> 05:09.041
Proximity to Great Lakes Reserve Center
help convince 'em to cede jurisdiction?

05:09.374 --> 05:11.543
Death of a Marine is
our jurisdiction.

05:12.061 --> 05:15.090
Yeah, well, he looks to be about 50.
What is he, a general?

05:15.497 --> 05:16.946
Former Marine.

05:18.687 --> 05:22.347
Is it going to be a problem
for you to sit this out, Agent Gibbs?

05:22.609 --> 05:23.852
It's your case...

05:25.810 --> 05:26.810
Director.

05:41.100 --> 05:43.372
There was no sign
of foul play at his residence.

05:43.453 --> 05:45.077
Tyler Owens was last seen

05:45.137 --> 05:48.370
ten days ago at his place of business,
the South Side Gym.

05:48.652 --> 05:50.296
That was Tony. Again.

05:50.377 --> 05:51.718
Is he looking for his wallet?

05:51.778 --> 05:53.919
He keeps asking what we're doing
in the "Wine-dy" City.

05:53.943 --> 05:55.801
- It's "windy".
- It's not so bad.

05:56.674 --> 05:58.944
- What'd you tell him?
- I told him we were doing our job,

05:58.968 --> 06:00.925
Director,
and that he should do the same.

06:00.985 --> 06:02.033
Good.

06:03.392 --> 06:04.392
Car?

06:05.011 --> 06:06.921
Out front. Destination?

06:07.240 --> 06:09.132
Thinking I'll go for a workout.

06:11.613 --> 06:13.083
Abs, what do you got?

06:14.108 --> 06:16.074
I am not at liberty to discuss

06:16.134 --> 06:18.324
the details
of Director Vance's case with you.

06:18.405 --> 06:20.805
And I would certainly hope
that you wouldn't try to bribe me.

06:21.321 --> 06:22.483
I wouldn't do that.

06:24.152 --> 06:25.588
Because I can't say a word

06:25.648 --> 06:28.792
about the five slugs
that Ducky pulled out of Owens' body.

06:28.873 --> 06:31.040
Not that there's a word to say,
'cause I don't even know

06:31.064 --> 06:32.463
if these 40-cal S & W's

06:32.544 --> 06:35.716
are a match to the weapon
that was found in deceased's pocket.

06:35.797 --> 06:37.509
Not that I would tell you
if they are.

06:37.842 --> 06:39.762
I'm assuming that your curiosity

06:39.843 --> 06:42.181
is purely for educational purposes.

06:42.423 --> 06:45.846
After Ducky does the autopsy,
we should be able to calculate

06:45.906 --> 06:48.062
how long
the accumulated postmortem gases

06:48.143 --> 06:51.190
took to counteract the weight
that kept Owens submerged.

06:51.381 --> 06:52.825
He was weighed down, huh?

06:52.885 --> 06:54.252
With what?

06:58.714 --> 06:59.907
Weights.

07:01.792 --> 07:02.792
Mismatched set.

07:03.114 --> 07:04.870
15 pounder, 20 pounder.

07:04.951 --> 07:07.748
They were threaded
through the deceased's belt.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.249
Well, it wasn't a mugging.

07:09.627 --> 07:11.159
I need you to keep your...

07:11.219 --> 07:13.837
educational inquiries
more abstract, Gibbs.

07:13.918 --> 07:16.131
I said that I wouldn't say
anything to you...

07:17.343 --> 07:19.093
and I'm not going
to lie to the Director.

07:19.174 --> 07:20.386
Owens carry a weapon?

07:21.186 --> 07:22.733
These are amazing, Gibbs.

07:22.952 --> 07:24.388
I can't hear anything.

07:24.471 --> 07:26.892
But, you know, feel free to...

07:26.973 --> 07:29.013
muse out loud to yourself.

07:29.073 --> 07:31.188
If this was my case,

07:31.472 --> 07:33.478
I'd see if Owens was registered.

07:33.538 --> 07:34.608
I'd run a search.

07:34.800 --> 07:37.695
Gibbs, you really need
to find something to do.

07:37.776 --> 07:40.864
"Idle hands are
the Devil's plaything."

07:40.944 --> 07:43.617
Just picture Mephistopheles
sitting on his...

07:43.877 --> 07:45.062
throne of fire,

07:45.347 --> 07:47.287
playing with his collection of...

07:47.990 --> 07:48.990
idle...

07:50.486 --> 07:51.792
hands.

08:05.786 --> 08:07.348
Sorry I couldn't help you, Gibbs.

08:10.048 --> 08:11.598
Get your left up, Campbell!

08:14.063 --> 08:15.792
You're dropping your left!

08:17.397 --> 08:18.872
Your other left, son!

08:19.077 --> 08:20.740
Man, it's a damn shame.

08:21.356 --> 08:22.563
Damn shame.

08:23.253 --> 08:25.075
Coach Owens was never really
a contender,

08:25.464 --> 08:26.744
but he was a great teacher.

08:26.824 --> 08:28.412
Tough as nails, drove you hard.

08:28.493 --> 08:30.122
Man worked your last nerve.

08:30.203 --> 08:31.827
But there was a method
to his madness.

08:31.887 --> 08:34.083
Brother pulled me off the wrong path,
set me right.

08:35.249 --> 08:38.005
So, Owens was revered by everyone?

08:38.249 --> 08:39.631
Within these walls,

08:39.712 --> 08:41.383
he was the black Miyagi.

08:44.991 --> 08:46.177
Not a full set.

08:46.593 --> 08:48.582
- You were counting?
- The dumbbells.

08:48.642 --> 08:51.086
- You're missing a few.
- We're lucky to have what we got.

08:51.479 --> 08:52.936
Keep movin' them feet, Campbell!

08:55.519 --> 08:57.274
Spit! Lubricate the man.

09:04.202 --> 09:05.949
Yo, Spit, hold the bucket up.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.988
So you can actually hit
something you're aiming at?

09:20.072 --> 09:21.072
Thanks.

09:21.725 --> 09:22.967
Let me see the towel.

09:26.665 --> 09:28.514
I used to carry the bucket myself.

09:28.595 --> 09:29.723
- For real?
- Yeah.

09:29.908 --> 09:31.141
Gotta start somewhere.

09:31.387 --> 09:32.391
Climb the ladder.

09:33.518 --> 09:35.520
You done pounding on my boys, Leon?

09:35.602 --> 09:37.419
I don't know, Ike,
you got anybody left?

09:39.522 --> 09:40.692
What do you say, David?

09:41.197 --> 09:42.486
Want to go a few rounds?

09:42.747 --> 09:45.030
I think that would violate
my primary assignment.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.491
Only if you manage
to lay a glove on me.

09:47.762 --> 09:50.661
Excuse me, darlin',
but this gym ain't coed.

09:51.278 --> 09:52.278
Another time.

09:52.327 --> 09:53.372
Just say when.

09:53.865 --> 09:54.865
Yeah?

09:55.363 --> 09:57.209
Run, get us a sandwich.
You know what I like.

09:57.483 --> 09:58.483
Okay.

09:58.691 --> 09:59.887
Leon, let's talk.

10:01.376 --> 10:02.673
Don't forget your jacket.

10:03.107 --> 10:04.133
I lost it.

10:04.214 --> 10:06.082
Go borrow mine,
it's the one on the end.

10:06.142 --> 10:07.142
Okay, thanks.

10:08.729 --> 10:10.305
His probably got stolen.

10:10.746 --> 10:13.332
Trying to teach the boy
to stand up for himself.

10:14.267 --> 10:15.519
Things that bad here, Ike?

10:16.144 --> 10:17.355
Same old same old.

10:20.432 --> 10:22.359
Nice flight from Chicago, Ms. Kole?

10:22.440 --> 10:23.550
Uneventful.

10:24.530 --> 10:26.071
Had enough excitement, though.

10:26.251 --> 10:28.323
Being abducted by Leon.

10:29.571 --> 10:30.571
Yeah.

10:31.130 --> 10:33.205
Well, plane travel's not
what it used to be, is it?

10:33.265 --> 10:35.747
Bet there wasn't even a movie.
I'm a big fan of movies.

10:35.827 --> 10:39.126
You don't have to make small talk
with me if you're uncomfortable.

10:39.538 --> 10:42.305
I'm not uncomfortable. It just
seemed like, the way you said it,

10:42.365 --> 10:44.339
that you had a relationship
with our new Director,

10:44.419 --> 10:46.570
and I said "new Director",

10:46.630 --> 10:48.903
by the way, not "nude erector".
That's a homophone.

10:49.690 --> 10:51.433
Unintentional, of course, but...

10:54.209 --> 10:55.209
The Director...

10:55.415 --> 10:57.591
he was just a ball of fire
when I knew him.

10:58.435 --> 10:59.763
No direction at all.

11:00.953 --> 11:02.777
Well, I guess we were all
someone else then.

11:04.067 --> 11:05.067
We?

11:05.148 --> 11:06.746
Tyler. He was my brother.

11:09.210 --> 11:10.798
I didn't know that. I'm sorry.

11:12.622 --> 11:14.500
Thank you, Anthony.
You're very sweet.

11:16.243 --> 11:17.243
My...

11:17.941 --> 11:18.999
patron saint.

11:19.177 --> 11:20.177
Actually,

11:20.247 --> 11:22.288
St. Nicholas
is the patron saint of...

11:25.582 --> 11:28.089
St. Anthony's who you turn to
when you've lost something.

11:29.304 --> 11:31.959
So, who does Anthony turn to
when he's...

11:32.438 --> 11:33.908
lost something?

11:34.854 --> 11:36.426
How do you know I've lost something?

11:36.939 --> 11:40.854
I may not know my saints,
but I definitely know my sinners.

11:43.773 --> 11:45.234
I miss Tyler.

11:46.656 --> 11:49.738
Seems like just the other day
you two coming through that door.

11:49.964 --> 11:52.574
Couple of string beans
fresh off the bus from Ohio.

11:52.776 --> 11:54.423
That was his idea, you know.

11:54.483 --> 11:55.765
Oh, don't I know it.

11:56.340 --> 11:59.180
Made sense he'd be the one to stick
in this business while you went off.

11:59.466 --> 12:00.818
That was his idea, too.

12:01.359 --> 12:02.583
Always pushing me.

12:04.904 --> 12:06.545
'Cause when you're young,

12:07.627 --> 12:09.883
it's all gas pedal and no brakes.

12:09.964 --> 12:11.954
Took a few false starts, but...

12:12.285 --> 12:13.971
you both learned patience.

12:14.575 --> 12:16.223
Throw a quick left-hand jab,

12:16.304 --> 12:18.033
not meant to do any damages.

12:18.371 --> 12:19.935
Messing with the other guy's vision.

12:20.016 --> 12:21.561
Right cross, brings the hands up.

12:21.642 --> 12:24.356
Work the body combinations
till that chin sticks out.

12:24.558 --> 12:26.441
Bang! Sets up the uppercut.

12:26.654 --> 12:28.467
But you can't rush that haymaker.

12:28.527 --> 12:29.527
Action...

12:29.720 --> 12:31.697
reaction, action.

12:33.278 --> 12:35.033
Tyler knew the art of the knockout.

12:35.634 --> 12:38.578
That's how I know he didn't just jump
into something out there.

12:39.384 --> 12:40.384
Yeah.

12:41.233 --> 12:42.541
I'm thinking the same thing.

12:42.885 --> 12:44.852
I figured you'd be back one day.

12:48.460 --> 12:50.194
You ready for this title fight?

12:51.926 --> 12:53.566
Talking about Joe Banks?

12:54.376 --> 12:55.595
Is he still top dog?

12:56.066 --> 12:59.234
Hadn't seen his face in a long while
before he showed up a couple weeks ago.

13:00.032 --> 13:01.810
He got a lot more cautious lately.

13:02.083 --> 13:03.702
Yeah, Banks doesn't use
a cell phone.

13:04.762 --> 13:06.690
He avoids electronic communication.

13:06.771 --> 13:09.359
- Leaves no trail behind.
- Except slime.

13:10.168 --> 13:12.529
He bought out a lot
of fighters over the years.

13:13.034 --> 13:14.854
I think Banks got sick of Tyler,

13:14.914 --> 13:17.117
poaching the local talent.
That's what I think!

13:17.198 --> 13:19.094
Well, you got to have muscle
to stay on top.

13:19.527 --> 13:21.163
That would make Tyler an obstacle.

13:24.383 --> 13:26.877
You got the muscle
to chase down his ghost?

13:28.474 --> 13:29.921
I'd rather lure him in.

13:30.548 --> 13:31.896
Make him come to me.

13:32.309 --> 13:33.425
Rope-a-dope.

13:34.673 --> 13:36.219
What do you got that he wants?

13:37.494 --> 13:38.964
You just spread the word.

13:40.834 --> 13:42.407
Banks can find me in DC.

13:58.321 --> 14:00.107
Our bloater became a floater.

14:00.167 --> 14:03.288
Yes. Whoever intended our fellow here
to rest in his watery

14:03.369 --> 14:06.762
grave forever didn't count
on the effects of putrefaction.

14:06.944 --> 14:09.700
You know what they say about
the best intentions, Doctor.

14:09.760 --> 14:11.439
Road to hell was paved with 'em.

14:11.547 --> 14:12.547
Time of death?

14:12.628 --> 14:14.712
Between four and ten days ago.

14:14.772 --> 14:18.303
A gas chromatography of the fatty acids
should provide a more exact time-frame.

14:19.168 --> 14:22.265
Mr. Palmer,
why don't you enlist Abby's help

14:22.346 --> 14:23.514
to finish those?

14:23.574 --> 14:24.674
Yes, Doctor.

14:31.223 --> 14:33.433
- Well, what do you have there?
- Background...

14:33.493 --> 14:34.528
Tyler Keith Owens.

14:34.609 --> 14:36.958
You're gonna get
that girl in trouble, Jethro.

14:37.163 --> 14:38.892
Born Cincinnati, '63,

14:38.952 --> 14:40.617
juvenile record in Ohio.

14:40.882 --> 14:42.369
Illinois driver's license, '81,

14:42.450 --> 14:44.204
boxing license, '83.

14:44.285 --> 14:47.473
Professional record of 19 wins,
14 losses.

14:48.476 --> 14:51.004
It's not too impressive.
Bit of a journeyman career.

14:51.209 --> 14:54.150
Tax returns show he stayed
in Chicago since it ended.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.891
Very thorough.

14:55.951 --> 14:56.951
No.

14:57.985 --> 14:59.313
Something's missing.

15:01.757 --> 15:03.348
No military record.

15:03.429 --> 15:05.100
Ducky,
if this guy ever was a Marine,

15:05.160 --> 15:07.060
Leon Vance is the only one
who thinks so.

15:07.140 --> 15:08.359
If he's not...

15:09.146 --> 15:12.676
then our Director has overstepped
the bounds of his authority.

15:22.758 --> 15:24.399
The last time you saw Tyler Owens

15:24.459 --> 15:27.029
was at an exhibition bout
at the South Side Gym?

15:27.152 --> 15:28.898
We were checking out the fighters.

15:29.594 --> 15:30.594
The "we"...

15:31.132 --> 15:32.743
you are referring to would be...?

15:32.824 --> 15:34.620
I was escorted by Joe Banks.

15:34.846 --> 15:35.846
Joe Banks.

15:36.220 --> 15:37.581
That name sounds so familiar.

15:37.840 --> 15:41.168
Well, your Director seems to think
he's a notorious crime boss.

15:41.969 --> 15:44.213
Must be from a movie, maybe.

15:45.029 --> 15:46.029
Well.

15:46.296 --> 15:49.155
What service do you perform
in the employ of Joe Banks?

15:51.258 --> 15:52.584
I think you know.

15:53.784 --> 15:55.140
I need you to be explicit.

15:56.128 --> 15:58.219
The same as you do for your boss.

15:58.848 --> 16:00.396
Anything he asks.

16:01.108 --> 16:01.908
Yeah.

16:01.968 --> 16:04.045
Well, my boss doesn't really ask
for things.

16:04.105 --> 16:06.080
We're supposed to figure it out
on our own before

16:06.480 --> 16:07.680
he gets really angry.

16:07.740 --> 16:09.488
He gets very... angry.

16:09.568 --> 16:11.623
What happens
if you don't figure it out?

16:11.988 --> 16:14.261
We get a smack
to the back of the head.

16:15.341 --> 16:17.246
That hasn't happened for a while,
actually.

16:18.141 --> 16:19.943
Maybe we're getting better
at our jobs.

16:21.212 --> 16:22.501
I know I am.

16:24.206 --> 16:26.296
You know, Anthony,

16:27.235 --> 16:29.190
I could help you
with your problem...

16:29.681 --> 16:30.983
if you'd like.

16:32.657 --> 16:33.707
My problem?

16:34.171 --> 16:36.651
My job is to read men.

16:37.439 --> 16:40.310
To know what they want,
and what they need.

16:41.085 --> 16:42.085
And I...

16:42.996 --> 16:44.773
see a man in need.

16:49.942 --> 16:50.942
Hi, Ziva.

16:50.970 --> 16:52.347
Hey, look, it's Ziva.

16:52.407 --> 16:53.824
Ziva, Tara. Tara, Ziva.

16:53.904 --> 16:54.992
We have met.

16:55.218 --> 16:56.452
I am here to relieve you.

16:57.172 --> 16:58.172
Well, then,

16:58.349 --> 16:59.744
I'm relieved.

17:01.984 --> 17:03.250
You look it.

17:25.578 --> 17:26.868
What's the word, Doctor?

17:29.159 --> 17:30.819
Owens went down fighting.

17:31.418 --> 17:32.571
I would hope so.

17:34.549 --> 17:37.563
Powder burns on his left palm
indicates that he was...

17:37.997 --> 17:41.414
probably grabbing the barrel of the gun
when the first shot was fired.

17:41.785 --> 17:45.318
That's the one that grazed
his right shoulder there.

17:46.301 --> 17:49.004
The next two rounds went
into his abdomen,

17:49.084 --> 17:51.590
perforated his stomach
and lower intestine.

17:51.936 --> 17:53.759
Probably put him on the ground.

17:53.991 --> 17:55.578
But he was still alive.

17:55.638 --> 17:58.222
The kill shots entered his chest.

17:59.900 --> 18:02.100
Damage to the heart
was catastrophic.

18:02.665 --> 18:04.645
Death from that point would be...

18:04.726 --> 18:05.726
rapid.

18:05.893 --> 18:08.774
This pattern of attack
suggests an untrained killer.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.152
Yeah, it was sloppy.

18:11.253 --> 18:13.153
My condolences, Director.

18:13.289 --> 18:17.223
I understand this man was
an acquaintance of yours.

18:17.612 --> 18:19.243
I hadn't seen him in some time.

18:19.600 --> 18:21.954
But once, you were quite close?

18:24.841 --> 18:25.916
Gibbs was here.

18:28.133 --> 18:29.356
What's his issue?

18:30.373 --> 18:33.155
There is a lack of recorded evidence

18:33.215 --> 18:35.092
that Owens was ever a Marine.

18:37.692 --> 18:40.222
You can't believe everything
you read on a piece of paper.

18:57.527 --> 18:59.366
I don't know,
the levels in the fatty acid...

18:59.701 --> 19:00.701
Miss Sciuto.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.870
Director Vance. Welcome back.

19:02.951 --> 19:05.129
- Has Gibbs been here?
- Now that you mention it,

19:05.189 --> 19:09.083
I do detect
the lingering aroma of "Old Spice"

19:09.191 --> 19:10.668
and sawdust.

19:10.749 --> 19:12.129
But that could just be from...

19:12.210 --> 19:13.689
We used...

19:13.895 --> 19:16.626
ethanol and benzophenone
in our analysis.

19:16.882 --> 19:19.136
That would explain the "Old Spice".

19:19.217 --> 19:20.262
And the sawdust?

19:20.995 --> 19:21.995
I...

19:22.135 --> 19:24.016
- am taking up woodworking.
- Really?

19:27.051 --> 19:29.021
I'm gonna build a coffin.

19:29.101 --> 19:30.105
She is.

19:30.186 --> 19:32.774
Did you get any actual work done,
or just woodwork?

19:33.300 --> 19:35.652
Tyler Owens was killed 11 days ago.

19:35.928 --> 19:38.066
That's fight night
at the South Side Gym.

19:39.254 --> 19:40.908
It's the last time
Joe Banks was seen.

19:40.989 --> 19:43.243
Well, the striations on the slugs

19:43.324 --> 19:45.704
match the gun disposed
of along with Owens.

19:45.946 --> 19:48.916
It was reported stolen
in a burglary in Chicago last year.

19:48.997 --> 19:50.250
Street piece.

19:50.331 --> 19:53.361
I wasn't able to get prints off
the dumbbell or the gun.

19:53.421 --> 19:56.715
Water covers up a lot of mistakes.
This guy might have gotten really lucky.

19:56.988 --> 19:59.215
Well, not too lucky.
He pulled us into it.

19:59.941 --> 20:01.887
Did you get any organic material
from his hands?

20:02.135 --> 20:04.231
I did, but it's not human.

20:06.939 --> 20:07.939
It's a...

20:10.922 --> 20:12.147
It's a bird feather.

20:12.339 --> 20:14.691
There was some stuck
in his belt buckle, as well.

20:14.772 --> 20:17.996
Maybe it got lodged
when he was in the water?

20:18.671 --> 20:21.281
It's not likely
he was shot by a bird.

20:25.907 --> 20:27.667
Is there anything else
you need to tell me?

20:27.727 --> 20:28.468
No, sir.

20:28.528 --> 20:31.249
That's everything, and I've been
completely candid with you, sir.

20:37.508 --> 20:38.508
Great.

20:38.811 --> 20:41.093
Now I have to build
a freakin' coffin.

20:42.011 --> 20:43.220
He's a good-looking guy.

20:44.488 --> 20:45.681
You two serious?

20:46.157 --> 20:48.558
He does not live here.
He travels a lot.

20:48.754 --> 20:51.019
Long-distance relationships
are impossible.

20:51.359 --> 20:52.468
Relationship?

20:53.360 --> 20:54.560
I do not know.

20:54.862 --> 20:56.976
Maybe you should be looking
for something

20:57.036 --> 20:58.276
a little closer to home.

21:01.342 --> 21:02.342
Director.

21:09.060 --> 21:11.790
I trust my people are treating you
all right?

21:12.020 --> 21:14.745
You don't have to go through
all this trouble to protect me.

21:16.368 --> 21:18.322
It's a long drive from Chicago,

21:19.339 --> 21:20.924
but he will come for you.

21:22.059 --> 21:23.762
You're counting on it, aren't you?

21:25.017 --> 21:27.389
I'm not here for protection at all.
I'm the bait.

21:27.643 --> 21:28.890
I'm sorry about Tyler.

21:31.346 --> 21:33.852
- I'm sorry I wasn't there.
- Only half of that is true.

21:33.912 --> 21:35.939
You cut both of us out of your life.

21:36.299 --> 21:38.275
- I miss him...
- Not like I do.

21:38.738 --> 21:40.728
But he's gone.
You can't undo that.

21:42.670 --> 21:45.782
Would I have even seen you again
if your hand wasn't forced?

21:48.690 --> 21:51.204
This is your worst fears
come to light.

21:54.449 --> 21:56.293
You think I'm scared of Banks?

21:56.373 --> 21:58.662
That is not what I'm talking about,
and you know it.

21:59.382 --> 22:01.006
You're scared of yourself,

22:01.384 --> 22:04.492
and pinning a body on Joe
is not going to make it go away.

22:05.258 --> 22:07.971
He had nothing to do
with Tyler's death. I know him.

22:08.420 --> 22:10.849
If that were true,
you would have quit him years ago.

22:17.264 --> 22:19.961
Take Ms. Kole
to the southeast safe house.

22:20.105 --> 22:22.851
Set up a rotation
with McGee and DiNozzo.

22:22.911 --> 22:24.874
I'm going to want somebody
with her at all times.

22:24.934 --> 22:27.157
Yes, sir. Where will you be?

22:27.585 --> 22:29.868
My wife will kill me
if I'm late for dinner.

22:48.657 --> 22:49.657
Hey!

22:50.040 --> 22:51.268
Daddy's home!

22:51.865 --> 22:53.748
Is this the Vance residence?

22:54.514 --> 22:56.118
It must be.

22:56.178 --> 22:57.314
I missed you, Dad.

22:57.374 --> 22:58.855
Hey, Jared.

22:59.896 --> 23:02.149
- What did you bring us?
- That's it, Kayla...

23:02.230 --> 23:04.739
you just get right to it.
Why don't you give me a hug first?

23:04.799 --> 23:06.446
- I missed you.
- Me, too.

23:06.527 --> 23:09.256
Your father wouldn't have gone
to Chicago without bringing back some...

23:09.280 --> 23:11.704
Frango mints.

23:11.764 --> 23:13.732
- What about me?
- What about you?

23:13.792 --> 23:15.747
You didn't think I'd forget about you,
did you?

23:15.828 --> 23:16.864
These...

23:17.150 --> 23:18.281
are very old...

23:18.828 --> 23:21.006
and they're very special to me.

23:21.308 --> 23:22.360
Cool.

23:24.120 --> 23:26.299
- They smell.
- That's from hard work.

23:26.493 --> 23:27.620
Hard work stinks.

23:28.112 --> 23:29.261
Yes, it does.

23:29.578 --> 23:31.791
- Mine smell good.
- No, no, not till after we eat.

23:31.851 --> 23:33.682
Now, you two go wash up.
Give me the mints.

23:33.974 --> 23:35.433
- Thanks, Daddy.
- Come on.

23:44.815 --> 23:45.815
So, I did good?

23:46.175 --> 23:47.175
You did.

23:47.512 --> 23:48.772
What, not great?

23:49.995 --> 23:52.998
Why didn't you tell me
you had a friend coming by?

24:00.074 --> 24:03.086
I have a policy
against bringing work home with me.

24:03.683 --> 24:05.839
Well, that's your policy, Leon.

24:06.417 --> 24:07.621
You disobeyed me.

24:07.852 --> 24:09.301
You've been hijacking my case.

24:09.612 --> 24:11.333
Aggressive choice of words.

24:11.466 --> 24:12.835
Aggressive actions.

24:13.201 --> 24:14.472
Demand an explanation.

24:14.915 --> 24:16.263
Your predecessor

24:16.755 --> 24:19.012
used that seat
for a personal agenda.

24:20.086 --> 24:21.146
Dangerous.

24:21.227 --> 24:23.023
You're not about
to let that happen again.

24:23.104 --> 24:24.104
No.

24:25.012 --> 24:27.277
Anything in my history
to suggest I would?

24:27.469 --> 24:29.154
I don't know enough
about your history.

24:30.009 --> 24:32.147
- Where did that come from?
- The CIA.

24:33.447 --> 24:35.452
You got that big
and axe to grind with me?

24:35.687 --> 24:38.538
Assume the dead man was a Marine.

24:38.716 --> 24:39.716
He was.

24:39.745 --> 24:40.957
And your friend.

24:41.038 --> 24:42.000
Was that, too.

24:42.060 --> 24:44.711
Still doesn't explain
why you wouldn't want me on the case.

24:44.792 --> 24:46.630
You think you can do
a better job than me?

24:46.690 --> 24:48.532
I think it's my job and not yours.

24:48.592 --> 24:49.630
You're right...

24:49.690 --> 24:51.842
seems neither of us are doing
what we're supposed to.

24:53.921 --> 24:55.124
Who is he to you?

24:56.584 --> 24:57.974
You haven't opened it.

24:58.356 --> 25:00.218
Situation was reversed.

25:01.133 --> 25:03.271
You did me the courtesy of asking.

25:04.236 --> 25:05.813
So you're asking my permission?

25:10.179 --> 25:12.155
Are you prepared for me to say no?

25:12.762 --> 25:13.990
It's your call.

25:17.579 --> 25:18.579
Leon?

25:21.331 --> 25:23.766
You know I don't like it
when you chew on those things.

25:27.208 --> 25:28.920
Gibbs, you're staying for dinner.

25:43.600 --> 25:47.448
I was a freshman at the University
of Maryland, and Leon...

25:48.205 --> 25:51.911
was at the Navy War College in Newport,
Rhode Island. You never told him?

25:51.992 --> 25:53.369
Never had the occasion to.

25:53.782 --> 25:55.832
You know he graduated
Annapolis, right?

25:56.182 --> 25:58.457
But he had to resign
his commission in the Marine Corps?

26:00.617 --> 26:03.381
That's funny,
I used to think I could spot a Marine.

26:03.571 --> 26:04.965
I didn't get to serve.

26:05.025 --> 26:07.301
Second lieutenant,
but he took a medical

26:07.382 --> 26:11.021
discharge 'cause he detached
the retina in his right eye from boxing,

26:11.081 --> 26:14.267
so he's going to teach Jared
to be careful with those things, right?

26:14.347 --> 26:16.477
Oh, yeah...
yeah, I'll teach him.

26:16.557 --> 26:18.730
He studied all the time,
except for this one night

26:18.811 --> 26:21.524
he just had to see a Terrapins game
because he couldn't miss...

26:21.619 --> 26:23.109
Len Bias.

26:23.244 --> 26:26.027
The best basketball player
ever to come out of Maryland.

26:26.109 --> 26:27.613
Until Carmelo Anthony.

26:27.694 --> 26:29.708
Carmelo was the number 3
pick in the draft.

26:29.768 --> 26:31.712
Lenny Bias was the number 2,

26:31.772 --> 26:34.872
and he would have even been better if
he hadn't died two days after the draft.

26:34.932 --> 26:36.122
- From...?
- Drugs.

26:36.203 --> 26:37.811
And how many times did he do drugs?

26:37.871 --> 26:38.871
Once.

26:39.696 --> 26:41.592
Bias put up 36 points that night.

26:41.652 --> 26:44.098
Okay, now, everybody in the student
section was just going crazy,

26:44.122 --> 26:46.668
right, just jumping up and down.
There's finally a time-out,

26:47.088 --> 26:50.595
and we all... you know,
just kind of start taking our seats.

26:52.176 --> 26:53.176
Right?

26:54.084 --> 26:55.684
Except for this one guy

26:56.232 --> 26:58.484
who's kind of just standing there
staring at me.

27:00.261 --> 27:01.261
OK?

27:02.895 --> 27:04.175
With that baby face.

27:06.338 --> 27:07.811
- Gross.
- That's how we met.

27:08.439 --> 27:09.906
Wash, dry... come on.

27:10.634 --> 27:12.466
- In the kitchen.
- All right, guys.

27:12.526 --> 27:15.164
- But I washed last.
- No, I washed last time.

27:15.224 --> 27:17.322
- It's my turn to dry.
- Let's go.

27:18.296 --> 27:20.166
How is that for a history lesson?

27:24.364 --> 27:26.264
Okay, Tony, clear to approach.

27:26.324 --> 27:27.427
I'm on the street.

27:29.484 --> 27:30.842
Door-to-door service.

27:30.923 --> 27:33.221
Check and make sure
you didn't leave anything back there.

27:34.594 --> 27:36.390
- What's this?
- Tony, I think she found...

27:36.471 --> 27:37.471
My wallet.

27:38.068 --> 27:39.685
Can you prove that it's yours?

27:39.765 --> 27:41.812
Yeah. If you open it up, you're going
to see my big

27:41.893 --> 27:43.648
fat smiling head
on the driver's license.

27:44.004 --> 27:45.942
There seems to be
something else here.

27:46.164 --> 27:48.931
You're making a circular crease
in the leather.

27:49.150 --> 27:52.031
- That would probably be a...
- I think she knows what that is.

27:52.112 --> 27:53.938
Now, why don't you want me
to see it?

27:54.153 --> 27:56.661
Could it be that it's nearing
its expiration date?

28:02.176 --> 28:03.459
She doesn't know anything.

28:04.540 --> 28:05.586
Get out of the car.

28:09.202 --> 28:11.054
- Get behind me.
- Why, what is it?

28:11.114 --> 28:12.114
Town car.

28:20.514 --> 28:21.514
Inside.

28:21.558 --> 28:22.558
Let's go.

28:23.619 --> 28:25.606
Ziva's radar is acutely tuned.

28:25.686 --> 28:27.700
Yeah, she doesn't miss a thing.

28:31.411 --> 28:32.806
Nice family, Leon.

28:33.526 --> 28:35.788
Kids want to rescue
a pit bull from a shelter.

28:36.086 --> 28:37.345
Can you imagine?

28:37.676 --> 28:40.162
Come home to your new house
and find this wild dog has...

28:40.243 --> 28:43.796
ripped up your stuff and dumped all over
your place while your back was turned?

28:44.470 --> 28:46.544
I think pit bulls get a bad rap.

28:46.811 --> 28:47.811
Is that right?

28:48.316 --> 28:49.316
Yeah.

28:49.863 --> 28:52.147
They're affectionate.
They're smart, loyal.

28:52.856 --> 28:53.861
Keep you safe.

28:55.143 --> 28:56.143
Treat 'em right.

28:58.343 --> 28:59.377
Don't lie to 'em.

29:00.568 --> 29:01.920
Who would lie to a dog?

29:04.410 --> 29:05.953
Owens was a Marine.

29:07.088 --> 29:09.208
I'm sure there's a reason
why there's no record of it.

29:10.528 --> 29:11.819
I don't need to know it.

29:13.580 --> 29:14.780
You hold on to it.

29:14.861 --> 29:16.058
You keep me honest.

29:18.873 --> 29:21.547
Don't know if it's necessary.
I ever need to know anything...

29:21.607 --> 29:23.787
Yeah, I know, you'll ask my wife.

29:32.792 --> 29:35.051
That Ms. Kole sure
has a one-track mind.

29:35.672 --> 29:37.470
Sure wish her boss
would come get her.

29:38.106 --> 29:39.680
The elusive Joe Banks.

29:39.935 --> 29:41.515
You think that's Vance's plan?

29:41.989 --> 29:43.517
I don't know...
what do you think?

29:43.742 --> 29:45.582
"They pull a knife, you pull a gun."

29:46.096 --> 29:49.522
"They send one of yours to the hospital,
you send one of theirs to the morgue."

29:49.694 --> 29:51.275
"That's the Chicago way."

29:52.379 --> 29:53.385
It's Connery.

29:53.949 --> 29:55.821
- Untouchables.
- Excuse me.

29:55.902 --> 29:58.074
I was told I could find
Tara Kole here.

30:00.342 --> 30:01.899
Are you Joe Banks?

30:02.616 --> 30:03.616
Wait.

30:03.762 --> 30:06.045
Say that again,
but more like Abe Vigoda.

30:06.105 --> 30:07.540
Joe Banks, Tom Hanks.

30:07.668 --> 30:09.166
Joe Versus the Volcano.

30:09.634 --> 30:11.796
Which is the story of a guy

30:11.988 --> 30:15.062
who is hired to go and jump
into a volcano because

30:15.122 --> 30:17.217
- he's got a brain cloud.
- Is that what you got?

30:17.298 --> 30:19.519
Maybe from repeated head trauma.

30:20.259 --> 30:21.679
Get Mr. Banks settled.

30:22.913 --> 30:26.056
John Patrick Shanley, who wrote
and directed Joe Versus the Volcano,

30:26.116 --> 30:27.676
won an Academy Award for Moonstruck.

30:27.736 --> 30:29.689
He also wrote and directed
the movie Doubt,

30:29.770 --> 30:31.678
which came out recently...
it was pretty good...

30:31.738 --> 30:34.019
but in the middle there,
clearly, there was a goofy phase.

30:36.467 --> 30:37.863
I forgot what that feels like.

30:38.295 --> 30:40.157
- It's been a while since...
- I know.

30:40.238 --> 30:43.369
- Physical contact.
- I... know.

30:44.216 --> 30:45.309
You know?

30:46.284 --> 30:47.284
You know.

30:48.079 --> 30:49.079
Any advice?

30:50.634 --> 30:51.877
Snap out of it.

30:52.874 --> 30:54.257
I have no response to that.

31:04.258 --> 31:06.340
I wasn't invited here, as it were.

31:07.549 --> 31:09.415
This is an interrogation room.

31:10.006 --> 31:11.439
You've seen your share.

31:12.246 --> 31:13.482
And not the worst.

31:14.075 --> 31:15.302
Not the best.

31:16.441 --> 31:17.778
Well, you know who I am.

31:18.311 --> 31:19.822
Am I supposed to know who you are?

31:20.903 --> 31:22.950
Name's Leon Vance.

31:25.797 --> 31:27.038
Fancy footwork.

31:27.467 --> 31:28.666
Wicked right cross.

31:29.714 --> 31:31.292
I never forget a fighter.

31:33.714 --> 31:35.419
You could have been big-time.

31:36.096 --> 31:37.096
I am.

31:39.273 --> 31:41.488
A lot bigger than you have tried
to take me down.

31:42.608 --> 31:43.664
Sit down.

31:59.708 --> 32:00.863
Tried to retire,

32:01.364 --> 32:04.450
but they don't let you out the game
so easy when you still hold the belt.

32:05.581 --> 32:06.804
Don't I know it.

32:10.830 --> 32:11.832
Tyler Owens.

32:12.213 --> 32:13.562
Was sorry to hear about that.

32:14.156 --> 32:15.377
How did it happen?

32:15.904 --> 32:16.962
How did it happen?

32:17.677 --> 32:20.048
Bodies don't drop
without your say-so.

32:23.266 --> 32:24.971
He's not who we think he is.

32:25.883 --> 32:26.923
What do you mean?

32:28.745 --> 32:30.559
His worst days are behind him.

32:30.928 --> 32:31.928
1994.

32:33.017 --> 32:35.309
Second-degree murder, not guilty.

32:36.577 --> 32:38.932
Aiding and abetting, 1996.

32:39.792 --> 32:41.243
Not guilty.

32:41.517 --> 32:42.404
RICO,

32:42.485 --> 32:44.543
2000, mistrial.

32:46.397 --> 32:49.700
You are everything Tyler hated.

32:50.321 --> 32:51.321
Pusher.

32:51.557 --> 32:52.557
Fight fixer.

32:52.992 --> 32:54.083
Murderer.

32:54.164 --> 32:56.919
Man, you're talking about sounds
like somebody to be feared.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.626
That's how you keep
your people quiet.

32:58.686 --> 33:00.457
I'm gonna let 'em know
they can talk now.

33:00.517 --> 33:01.517
People?

33:02.334 --> 33:03.334
You mean Tara?

33:04.905 --> 33:06.428
She'll never say a word against me.

33:06.509 --> 33:09.431
She will, once she knows
she doesn't have to be afraid of you.

33:09.903 --> 33:11.809
She's never had a reason
to be afraid of me.

33:12.206 --> 33:14.019
Why wouldn't she incriminate you
then?

33:14.079 --> 33:15.604
Let me tell you something, partner.

33:15.684 --> 33:18.944
First of all, you're way off base.
Second of all, there are laws

33:19.354 --> 33:22.069
protecting her
against saying things like that.

33:25.856 --> 33:27.400
Protecting both of us.

33:30.166 --> 33:31.370
He's your husband?!

33:32.840 --> 33:34.554
That's what I wanted to see.

33:34.792 --> 33:35.558
What?

33:35.618 --> 33:38.587
That's what it looks like
when you know you're wrong.

33:38.827 --> 33:41.839
- I wanted to see if you even knew.
- How do you marry a man like that?

33:41.920 --> 33:43.936
- Joe's changed.
- You expect me to buy that?

33:43.996 --> 33:46.812
He hasn't been hiding
from prosecution. He's out of the game.

33:46.872 --> 33:49.405
He's a good man who doesn't want
to become a target for some...

33:49.465 --> 33:51.748
- punk to make a name off of.
- You calling me a punk?

33:51.808 --> 33:53.121
I'm trying to get justice.

33:53.222 --> 33:54.651
You're lost, I can see it.

33:56.437 --> 33:58.689
- What happened to Tyler?
- I don't know.

33:58.770 --> 33:59.872
What do you think?

34:00.122 --> 34:01.586
Tyler was family.

34:02.226 --> 34:04.361
It's a shot at Joe
as much as anything else.

34:10.511 --> 34:11.757
Joe and I...

34:12.306 --> 34:13.585
fell in love.

34:14.389 --> 34:15.389
It happens.

34:17.871 --> 34:19.464
He lost his hunger.

34:20.880 --> 34:22.588
He found something else.

34:23.349 --> 34:25.466
When a man
that powerful loses a step,

34:26.922 --> 34:30.793
there's always somebody
right behind him, waiting to take over.

34:31.454 --> 34:32.454
That's right.

34:33.054 --> 34:34.425
When you're in charge,

34:36.081 --> 34:38.413
you always got to watch your back.

34:38.585 --> 34:39.685
Sad truth.

34:40.061 --> 34:41.208
Sometimes,

34:42.251 --> 34:44.944
you just can't protect
the people you love.

34:53.733 --> 34:54.784
Blood on concrete?

34:54.967 --> 34:57.551
Chicago PD thinks
this might be the crime scene.

34:57.632 --> 35:00.178
It's a couple blocks
from the South Side Gym, en route

35:00.259 --> 35:02.932
- to Tyler Owens' residence.
- He never made it home.

35:03.013 --> 35:04.191
What about Joe Banks?

35:04.420 --> 35:06.591
Tara says they spoke that night,
but that was all.

35:06.651 --> 35:09.146
Director Vance let him go.
Still holding her.

35:09.717 --> 35:11.899
- Big boss was wrong.
- So far. But...

35:12.063 --> 35:14.276
you can't make an omelet
without breaking some legs.

35:14.357 --> 35:16.517
- You're never making me breakfast.
- That's the truth.

35:16.544 --> 35:18.822
- It's supposed to be "eggs".
- Cook them yourself.

35:20.182 --> 35:22.411
Did you resolve things
with Director Vance?

35:22.471 --> 35:24.995
- Well, we made a breakthrough.
- He let you in?

35:25.076 --> 35:26.247
We had dinner.

35:27.150 --> 35:30.243
That does tend
to alter a relationship.

35:30.864 --> 35:34.046
It's been far too long
since you and I had dinner.

35:34.732 --> 35:37.585
I'll tell you what, Duck.
You do me a favor, I'll buy.

35:37.985 --> 35:38.985
Name it.

35:39.302 --> 35:41.302
I need you to reexamine this body.

35:43.032 --> 35:45.975
Something specific
you want me to look for?

35:47.305 --> 35:48.602
Evidence of surgery.

36:05.491 --> 36:07.156
I checked in with a friend on Vice.

36:07.216 --> 36:10.124
Banks has divested himself
from his entire enterprise.

36:10.916 --> 36:13.233
You got a lot of friends in Chicago.

36:14.391 --> 36:16.014
Tyler was more than a friend.

36:18.197 --> 36:20.237
That's the man that taught me
the difference between

36:20.280 --> 36:21.717
surviving and really living.

36:22.323 --> 36:23.323
He was my hero.

36:24.173 --> 36:25.389
You're not giving up.

36:29.065 --> 36:32.730
In 30 years, the national rate
for solving murders dropped from...

36:32.810 --> 36:34.148
80 to 60%.

36:35.148 --> 36:36.275
You know why that is?

36:36.565 --> 36:37.932
Murder got less personal.

36:37.992 --> 36:40.817
Drive-bys, drug crimes, turf wars.

36:41.026 --> 36:43.157
I owe Tyler my life,
there's no way I'm giving up.

36:43.383 --> 36:44.926
He might've been a hero to you.

36:45.852 --> 36:47.418
Owens was still just a man.

36:48.432 --> 36:50.075
Motive could be simple.

36:50.807 --> 36:52.967
So what did he have
that was worth getting killed over?

36:53.470 --> 36:54.585
Just a name.

36:54.744 --> 36:56.338
Wasn't involved in drugs.

36:57.184 --> 36:58.781
Killer didn't take his money...

36:59.021 --> 37:00.598
or his shoes or his...

37:03.718 --> 37:04.718
His coat.

37:07.103 --> 37:08.599
Nice heavy leather coat.

37:12.086 --> 37:13.126
Duck down.

37:13.880 --> 37:17.000
Don't throw anything. I didn't mean to
say anything to Gibbs, I'm really sorry.

37:23.745 --> 37:26.367
Ms. Sciuto,
I don't care what you told him,

37:26.447 --> 37:29.208
as long as you tell me
that those feathers were duck down...

37:29.939 --> 37:31.872
the ones that were discovered
on Owens' body.

37:31.953 --> 37:33.082
Hungarian goose,

37:33.163 --> 37:36.085
to be specific, probably used
as some sort of filler in...

37:36.166 --> 37:37.835
An inexpensive winter coat.

37:39.298 --> 37:40.381
Wasn't stolen.

37:40.872 --> 37:43.467
Kid got rid of it
because it was covered in blood.

37:43.718 --> 37:44.718
Good work, Abs.

37:44.798 --> 37:47.679
Too much work. Don't ever put me
in that position again.

37:48.395 --> 37:49.824
Okay, I won't.

37:51.801 --> 37:54.001
But I will help you
with your project here, if you want.

37:54.546 --> 37:56.100
It's a coffin, not a boat.

37:57.026 --> 37:59.048
All right, I'm coming, I'm coming.

37:59.460 --> 38:00.822
Damn it, Spit.

38:02.719 --> 38:05.749
- Hey Ike, It's Leon.
- Hold on a minute.

38:07.769 --> 38:09.125
Ike, it's Leon.

38:10.250 --> 38:11.518
Can you hear me?

38:15.911 --> 38:17.179
You figured it out?

38:17.626 --> 38:18.626
Too late.

38:18.936 --> 38:21.505
This kid Spit started bragging
about it.

38:23.803 --> 38:25.524
How he took down the champ.

38:27.266 --> 38:29.555
A couple of fighters took justice
into their own hands.

38:30.061 --> 38:32.045
- He'll live?
- It's too soon to tell.

38:36.582 --> 38:38.223
Tyler had a philosophy...

38:38.447 --> 38:40.149
you had to earn
your way into the ring.

38:40.367 --> 38:43.402
He didn't want this next generation
to make the same mistakes he did.

38:44.001 --> 38:45.613
This kid didn't see it that way.

38:47.053 --> 38:49.032
Get tired of working
for his respect.

38:50.331 --> 38:51.869
Thought he could take it with a gun.

38:51.950 --> 38:54.074
Kid thought nobody noticed him.

38:55.190 --> 38:57.373
Tyler was just standing
between him being

38:57.647 --> 38:59.626
invisible and everybody
knowing who he is.

39:03.491 --> 39:04.897
I'm headed back to Chicago.

39:06.588 --> 39:08.635
I'm gonna take Tyler home
for a memorial service.

39:12.074 --> 39:13.891
Is there anything
you need before I go?

39:17.013 --> 39:18.540
Nothing that can't wait.

39:34.112 --> 39:36.135
You're driving
all the way back to Chicago?

39:36.386 --> 39:37.695
Oh, it's not so bad.

39:37.755 --> 39:38.872
Joe's good company.

39:39.838 --> 39:41.663
I'll escort Ms. Kole out.

39:41.831 --> 39:42.573
Okay.

39:42.633 --> 39:44.128
I need to speak to you.

39:55.968 --> 39:58.128
For some reason,
you can see right through my disguise.

39:58.666 --> 40:00.604
How bad's the dry spell?

40:00.685 --> 40:01.685
Saharan.

40:01.919 --> 40:04.323
- Never been a problem before?
- You kidding me?

40:04.917 --> 40:07.611
Not since Lisa Mullen taught me
to play doctor in the second grade.

40:07.758 --> 40:08.758
What's changed?

40:09.482 --> 40:10.482
Real doctor,

40:11.517 --> 40:13.367
real love, real bad breakup.

40:13.942 --> 40:15.706
Messed you up pretty bad, huh?

40:16.008 --> 40:19.888
Kicked off a slump with women
that's unprecedented in my adult life.

40:20.278 --> 40:21.447
I've tried everything.

40:21.507 --> 40:24.838
I mean, I'm dating constantly,
but I can't seem to get it right.

40:24.898 --> 40:27.798
I'm not closing the deal, you know?
Like there's a saboteur in my head.

40:28.062 --> 40:31.197
I'm making every rookie mistake. I'm
talking about myself too much at dinner.

40:31.257 --> 40:34.006
I mean, I'm talking about my ex,
I'm talking about my feelings, I...

40:34.066 --> 40:35.138
I scare 'em off.

40:36.339 --> 40:37.339
Crying?

40:40.519 --> 40:41.989
DiNozzo men don't cry.

40:42.245 --> 40:43.902
You'd be surprised...

40:43.962 --> 40:46.988
how many of my clients just want
a shoulder to cry on.

40:48.334 --> 40:49.659
Opening up...

40:50.654 --> 40:52.002
is the first step.

40:52.574 --> 40:54.032
Let's skip to the last step.

40:55.488 --> 40:56.734
That's easy.

40:57.772 --> 40:59.703
Pick the right woman.

41:04.709 --> 41:06.837
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

41:07.143 --> 41:08.686
Yeah, it's fine.

41:21.151 --> 41:23.103
It's a struggle...

41:24.756 --> 41:26.690
to become the man
that you want to be.

41:28.082 --> 41:29.964
It's harder than you want,

41:30.561 --> 41:32.161
it's longer than you want,

41:34.103 --> 41:35.907
and it takes more out of you than...

41:37.360 --> 41:39.417
than you expect that it should.

41:43.177 --> 41:46.001
Silicon band around
his right eyeball.

41:46.225 --> 41:47.573
Ocular surgery.

41:47.848 --> 41:50.964
No doubt to repair
a detached retina.

41:51.654 --> 41:53.643
What has this to do with his death?

41:53.703 --> 41:54.724
Nothing.

41:56.827 --> 41:59.681
I don't know if Tyler became
the man that he wanted to be,

42:00.735 --> 42:03.560
but I do know he wanted to be
the man that he ultimately became.

42:05.548 --> 42:08.360
He was a leader, he was a teacher,

42:09.605 --> 42:12.840
and he taught those hard lessons
to so many of us here.

42:15.973 --> 42:18.779
He helped us to see
that it might be possible.

42:22.825 --> 42:23.942
To be someone else.

42:24.721 --> 42:27.112
To be better
than you might have dreamed.

42:30.127 --> 42:31.852
Our dreams got bigger

42:33.247 --> 42:35.258
because he told us
that it was possible.

42:37.384 --> 42:40.104
I hope his legacy
lives on in each of us.

42:43.624 --> 42:46.100
For every life that was touched
by his generosity.

42:48.517 --> 42:51.107
I know that Tyler Owens
will live on in me.

42:53.667 --> 42:54.667
Thank you.
