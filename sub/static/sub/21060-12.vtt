You know, there's a lot of, uh,

He's running on Madeleine!

02:37.067 --> 02:38.600

03:04.133 --> 03:05.967
(speaks indistinctly)

03:09.600 --> 03:12.800
-We just cleared this yard
while we were here.
-Okay. Yeah.

03:12.833 --> 03:14.600
-Is that shed locked?

03:19.367 --> 03:21.367
-Go look under that house.
-Yeah.

03:21.400 --> 03:25.300
-I wonder if we could find a--
Oh, look at that crawl space
under there, too.

03:25.333 --> 03:28.633

03:28.667 --> 03:32.133
-Come out!
-Let me see your hands!

03:32.167 --> 03:35.067

the dog in after you!

03:35.100 --> 03:36.567
Let me see your hands!

03:36.600 --> 03:39.833
Do you see his hand?
-Yeah. Let me see
the other hand!

03:39.867 --> 03:41.900
-Hey, man,

03:41.933 --> 03:43.300
-I got both of 'em.

03:43.333 --> 03:46.300
-Come on!
Come out to me!
-Which way is he comin' out?

03:48.333 --> 03:50.367
-You want him this way?
-Got this side covered?

03:50.400 --> 03:53.300
-You want him this way?
-No, if he's comin' out
to y'all--

03:53.333 --> 03:56.767
-All right, crawl slowly
while keepin' your hands
in front of you.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.600
-Keep comin'!
-Crawl!

04:01.633 --> 04:03.433
I don't wanna hear excuses,
keep crawlin'!

04:03.467 --> 04:05.300
-Come out!

-(radio chatter)

04:10.100 --> 04:11.933

04:11.967 --> 04:14.300
-All right, bud.
-Oh, yeah.

04:14.333 --> 04:18.733
-I was asleep.
I was sleepin'.
I was sleepin', sir.

04:18.767 --> 04:21.200
I ain't do nothin' wrong.
-No, man.

04:21.233 --> 04:22.567
-Pick him up.
-All right.

04:22.600 --> 04:24.467
-We already saw you
run outta that car, man.

04:24.500 --> 04:26.133
-That wasn't me, man.
-All right, man.

04:26.167 --> 04:27.800
-They had three people
in the truck.

04:27.833 --> 04:29.600
-I hear you.
-I thought you
were sleepin', man.

04:29.633 --> 04:31.667
-And the man
duckin' under the seat,

04:31.700 --> 04:33.733
holdin' a gun to me,
tellin' me to drive.

04:33.767 --> 04:34.967
-So you were drivin' that truck?

04:35.067 --> 04:37.200
-I wanna let y'all know
I was forced to drive.

04:37.233 --> 04:41.533
-By who?
A dude named Dylan,
with a gun.

04:41.567 --> 04:43.400
'Cause he has warrants.

04:43.433 --> 04:46.233
I'm gonna write a statement.
I'm just gonna let y'all
know that.

04:46.267 --> 04:47.867
-What's your name?
-What's your name?

04:47.900 --> 04:50.067
-My name's Tyson.
-Tyson what?

04:50.100 --> 04:52.500
-I'm tryin' to tell you,
they had a man with a gun

04:52.533 --> 04:54.267
tryin' to force me
to drive, man.

04:54.300 --> 04:56.200
-Listen to me, you just led us
on a car chase--

04:56.233 --> 04:57.933
-But I'm tellin' you,
I was forced to drive, sir!

04:57.967 --> 05:00.233
What's your name?
What's your name?
Mr. Milazzo, please--

05:00.267 --> 05:02.300
-Did they also force you
to run after you got out
of the car?

05:02.333 --> 05:04.067
-Yes, sir.
-Why didn't you come to us
for help, then?

05:04.067 --> 05:06.700
-Because he told me to run
or he was goin' to kill me.
-Have a seat. Have a seat.

05:06.733 --> 05:08.333
-We were all over the area
lookin' for you--

05:08.367 --> 05:09.900
-Man, this man
is from Baton Rouge--

05:09.933 --> 05:12.367
-Have a seat!
Put your feet in!

05:12.400 --> 05:14.467
-I'm the one who went
to stop you at the hotel, okay?

05:14.500 --> 05:17.667
-Yes, and they had a man
caught under the seat,
just like this,

05:17.700 --> 05:20.267
hidin'.
When he seen the law, man,
get-- get behind me.

05:20.300 --> 05:22.700
That's what I'm tryin'
to tell you.
-You looked right at me.

05:22.733 --> 05:25.267
-Yeah, I looked at you,
'cause he said, "Don't panic."

05:25.300 --> 05:27.533
I had to show
that I wasn't scared
or nothin'.

05:27.567 --> 05:29.567
-How come you just didn't
jump out the car?
What's he gonna do

05:29.600 --> 05:31.367
-if the police...
-Shoot the gun.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.933
-When you hit the telephone pole
right here, only one person
came out the car.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.767
I was the one chasin' you
the whole time.

05:35.800 --> 05:39.667
-Sir, all I'm tellin' you,
they had somebody
forcin' me to drive.

05:39.700 --> 05:42.067
-So who was forcin' you
to run from us after you
got outta the car?

05:42.067 --> 05:44.167
-He told me
he was gonna kill me--

05:44.200 --> 05:45.867
-He was under that house
with you?

05:45.900 --> 05:47.633
-No, sir, he ran--
-So how come you didn't
come out--

05:47.667 --> 05:49.900
How come you didn't
come out and say,
"Hey, man, some guy

05:49.933 --> 05:52.500
just had a gun to my head"?
You seen all the police lights.

05:52.533 --> 05:57.833
-'Cause he said he was gonna
kill me if I'da get caught
and tell 'em who he was.

05:57.867 --> 06:00.200
-So you saw all these
police cars out here,
you didn't wanna come out

06:00.233 --> 06:03.067
and say, "Hey, this guy
just had a gun to my head."

06:05.967 --> 06:08.200
You didn't that'd be safer
than hidin' under the house?

06:08.233 --> 06:11.700
I'm just tryin' to save myself
from gettin' killed, man.

06:11.733 --> 06:14.500
-It sounds like more
you're tryin' to save yourself
from goin' to prison.

06:14.533 --> 06:17.300
-No, I'm tryin' to save myself
from gettin' killed.

06:17.333 --> 06:18.900
-(radio chatter)

06:18.933 --> 06:20.867
-You know what your
charges are?

06:20.900 --> 06:23.433
-What's my charge?
-You know what
you're goin' to jail for?

06:23.467 --> 06:25.600
You're goin' to jail
for a stolen vehicle.

06:25.633 --> 06:27.300
You're going to jail
for aggravated flight.

06:27.333 --> 06:29.567
-Stolen-- I didn't know
it was a stolen vehicle,

06:29.600 --> 06:31.800
and plus,
I was forced to have to--

06:31.833 --> 06:34.067
-You gonna be able
to tell all that in court?

06:34.100 --> 06:37.267
I'll be back with you
in a minute, hang tight.

06:37.300 --> 06:38.800
He was the only one
that came out the car.

06:38.833 --> 06:41.967
-You saw him bail out?
-Yeah, yeah. I saw him
come out.

06:42.067 --> 06:44.233
I couldn't see where he went
after that because, uh,
the building.

06:44.267 --> 06:46.533
-Yeah, and everyone
came in right behind him--
-That was the only door

06:46.567 --> 06:48.467
that was open on the whole car,
was the driver's side one.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.067
-After he bailed,
nobody else bailed.

06:50.100 --> 06:52.867
-Good job, man.
-You got it.
On to the next one.

06:54.800 --> 06:57.267
-Policeman:
During my time in this job,
I've come to realize

06:57.300 --> 07:00.767
that cops tend to marry

07:00.800 --> 07:04.233
nurses, teachers or other cops.

07:04.267 --> 07:07.233
And I'm part of that stereotype
now, I've just got recently

07:07.267 --> 07:09.733
engaged to my fiancee,
and she's also a police officer,

07:09.767 --> 07:12.300
and, uh, we're-- we're as happy
as we could be right now.

07:12.333 --> 07:16.100
-(radio chatter)
-Uh, we've got a call
of a suspicious vehicle.

07:16.133 --> 07:17.833
It's been there for a while,
loud music playin'.

07:17.867 --> 07:20.100
So we're gonna see
what's goin' on.

07:26.633 --> 07:30.767
-(muffled music thumping)

07:37.433 --> 07:40.333
It's in drive?

07:40.367 --> 07:41.533
All right.

07:42.733 --> 07:44.733
-(knocking on window)

07:44.767 --> 07:46.433
-Hey, buddy.
Keep your foot
on the brake.

07:46.467 --> 07:48.400
Keep your foot on the brake.
Keep your foot on the brake.

07:48.433 --> 07:50.900
Hey, come here.
Hey, relax.
Put your foot on the brake.

07:50.933 --> 07:53.367
Pump the brake.
Get outta the car.

07:53.400 --> 07:56.233
Put it in park.
Put it in park.

07:56.267 --> 07:58.633
-It's in park.
It's in park. It's in park.
-All right, get outta the car.

07:58.667 --> 08:01.200
Relax.
I told you to keep your foot
on the brake.

08:01.233 --> 08:02.933
What's wrong, buddy?
Step out.

08:02.967 --> 08:04.400
-Come on--
-Do you have any weapons
on you?

08:05.567 --> 08:07.367
-No, no weapons.

08:09.267 --> 08:11.633
-You passed out
at the wheel here
at the intersection.

08:11.667 --> 08:13.300
Got your ID on you?
-Yes, sir.

08:13.333 --> 08:15.267
-Here, turn around
and talk to me.

08:15.300 --> 08:18.667
Look at me. Whoa.
You all right?
-Jesus Christ! Whoa!

08:18.700 --> 08:21.400
-You good?
-Yeah, I'm fine!

08:21.433 --> 08:23.633
I'm fine. I'm fine.
-What's the issue?
Why are you sleepin'

08:23.667 --> 08:27.700
at the wheel here?
-I've had a long day,
I'm-- I'm-- I'm goin' home.

08:27.733 --> 08:31.067
-Okay. Where's home?
-45th-- on 45th Street.

08:31.100 --> 08:33.433
-You almost made it.
-I almost made it.

08:33.467 --> 08:35.067
-Okay.

08:38.367 --> 08:41.533
Is this car registered to you?
-It's my-- my wife's car.

08:41.567 --> 08:42.967
-All right.

08:44.767 --> 08:46.900
Yeah.
Thanks, appreciate it.

08:46.933 --> 08:50.067
Take a look at me.
Do you have anything on you
that's-- I need to know about?

08:50.100 --> 08:51.733
-No.
-Mind if I search you
real quick?

08:51.767 --> 08:53.433
-Yeah.
-Turn around.

08:53.467 --> 08:54.500
You can relax.

08:56.133 --> 08:57.633
You take medications
or anything like that?

08:57.667 --> 08:58.933
-No, sir.
-No? Nothin'?

08:58.967 --> 09:01.433
-No, sir.
-You're just that tired?

09:01.467 --> 09:03.833
-Yeah.
-How long you been awake?

09:03.867 --> 09:06.500
-What's that?
-How long have you been awake?

09:06.533 --> 09:10.067
-I-- I don't know
what your-- your question is.
What's the--

09:10.067 --> 09:13.567
-I'm-- I'm tryin' to gather
why you're passed out
at the wheel,

09:13.600 --> 09:16.533
and if you're that tired,
I'm askin' you how long
you're awake, that's all.

09:16.567 --> 09:18.700
-Like I said--
-Is there anything in the car
I need to know about?

09:18.733 --> 09:20.167
-No.
-Mind if I check it real quick?

09:20.200 --> 09:22.200
-Yeah, go ahead.
-All right, go ahead
and stand over there for me?

09:22.233 --> 09:24.333
-Come on over here, boss.
-Can I have my cigarettes?

09:24.367 --> 09:26.200
-Hey, come on over here. Hey.

09:28.133 --> 09:29.433
-So you said there's nothing
in the car?

09:29.467 --> 09:31.667
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

09:31.700 --> 09:33.900
Sir, you're not prescribed--
Hey, stop.

09:33.933 --> 09:35.367
Stop and turn around.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.833
-Hmm...

09:39.500 --> 09:41.533
-You're not prescribed
any medications, right?

09:41.567 --> 09:45.100
-'Cause I asked you
that question.
Correct? Yes, no?

09:45.133 --> 09:49.067
-Yes. You just asked me
if I was on any medications.
I'm not on any medications.

09:49.100 --> 09:52.067
-Okay.
14, adult male detained.

09:52.067 --> 09:53.867
All right, walk back for me
real quick.

09:53.900 --> 09:56.367
There's some, uh, pills
in his driver's side door there

09:56.400 --> 09:58.133
in a little, small baggie.

10:00.700 --> 10:02.200
Take a seat,
all the way in.

10:02.233 --> 10:03.900
-Okay.

10:03.933 --> 10:08.300
-It's a little
individual sales baggie of pills
right here in the door.

10:08.333 --> 10:12.433
Four of 'em look like
morphine... other three,
we'll have to do, uh--

10:12.467 --> 10:15.167
We'll check 'em all
on drugs.com
and identify 'em.

10:15.200 --> 10:17.533
But right now,
there's two different types.

10:17.567 --> 10:19.867
-Well, he's gonna go
for the pills at least.

10:19.900 --> 10:23.167
-There's drugs.com you
can go on here.

10:23.200 --> 10:25.467
It's a resource we use
in law enforcement over here

10:25.500 --> 10:28.467
to identify, uh, medications
and prescriptions.

10:28.500 --> 10:34.733
And it's actually, uh,
valid to, uh, profess
in court as a way for us

10:34.767 --> 10:36.800
to identify these drugs.

10:36.833 --> 10:39.800
So, uh, I've identified
both types of these pills.

10:39.833 --> 10:43.700
They're oxycodones,
and the blue ones
are gonna be alprazolam.

10:43.733 --> 10:46.633
-I didn't realize
that I had those
in the car.

10:46.667 --> 10:49.600
-Had what in the car?
-That there was pills
in the car.

10:49.633 --> 10:51.767
-Did you buy
that little baggie?

10:51.800 --> 10:53.500
-Um... yes, I did.

10:53.533 --> 10:54.900
-Okay.
When did you buy that baggie?

10:54.933 --> 10:57.967
-Um... I just bought
the pill baggie.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.500
-You were comin'
from the place you bought it.

10:59.533 --> 11:02.067
-Uh, no, actually, I was comin'
from Waffle House.

11:02.067 --> 11:03.333
-From Waffle House?

11:03.367 --> 11:04.767
-Yes.
-So, you bought 'em,
went to Waffle House,

11:04.800 --> 11:06.067
and you were headin' home?

11:06.067 --> 11:08.367
-Yes,
-Okay. So, it-- it's
pretty cut and dry.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.467
-Yes, sir.
-You're gonna be goin' to jail
tonight for possession

11:10.500 --> 11:13.433
of a controlled substance.
Is there anyone that can
pick up your car-- close,

11:13.467 --> 11:15.300
or we're gonna have
to impound it?

11:15.333 --> 11:18.133
-No, I was just askin'
if my wife could pick up
my car?

11:18.167 --> 11:20.867
-If she can come here
and do so, we'll gladly
do that for you.

11:20.900 --> 11:25.367
-Can you explain to her
that, uh... maybe tell her
that it wasn't

11:25.400 --> 11:28.400
-a controlled substance?
-She doesn't know
about your problem?

11:28.433 --> 11:33.067
-Uh... she-- she does,
but I don't wanna lose
my wife and kids.

11:33.100 --> 11:35.167
-I'm not gonna lie
to your wife.

11:35.200 --> 11:37.533
All right?
That's just not in my character.
I'm not gonna lie to anybody

11:37.567 --> 11:40.433
like that. Okay?
Especially someone that's--

11:40.467 --> 11:43.833
probably doesn't deserve
to be lied to, especially
in the position you put her in.

11:43.867 --> 11:47.200
So I'm gonna let you guys talk
if she comes to pick up
the car, okay?

11:47.233 --> 11:48.767
-Great.

11:48.800 --> 11:51.400
-I believe this is her.
Uh, we didn't really
wanna impound the car

11:51.433 --> 11:54.300
if we didn't have to.
Um, there's no use of her
suffering for his decision,

11:54.333 --> 11:58.067
so, I'm gonna talk to her
real quick, explain
what's goin' on.

11:58.100 --> 12:01.767
And then let her talk to him
and see if he'll be honest
with her what's goin' on.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.467
Give him a chance first.
How you doin', Renee?

12:04.500 --> 12:06.933
How you doin'?
All right, so he's in the car
right now, he wants to talk

12:06.967 --> 12:08.300
to you about
what's goin' on.

12:08.333 --> 12:11.567
All right.
Like I said, I didn't wanna
impound he car

12:11.600 --> 12:13.167
if I didn't have to.
-Thank you,
'cause that's...

12:13.200 --> 12:14.767
-There's no reason
you shouldn't have a car.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.067
-Yep, that's my transportation.
-And you live close,
so it worked out.

12:17.100 --> 12:19.733
Um, he's in cuffs
in the back of the cruiser
right now.

12:19.767 --> 12:21.500
I'm gonna give you
a chance to talk to him.

12:21.533 --> 12:23.367
-Okay.
-And I'm gonna give him
a chance to explain to you

12:23.400 --> 12:24.500
what's goin' on.

12:24.533 --> 12:25.667
And we'll go from there.
All right?

12:25.700 --> 12:27.067
-Yeah.
-Okay.

12:27.067 --> 12:29.133
He's right this way,
he's in the first car back here.

12:29.167 --> 12:31.067
-Okay.
What happened?

12:31.067 --> 12:34.600
-I was coming home,
and I stopped at the stop sign,

12:34.633 --> 12:38.700
and I stayed there
for a while and...

12:40.900 --> 12:42.833
they found something in the car.

12:42.867 --> 12:45.067
-What? What was
in the car?

12:45.067 --> 12:47.400
What was in the car, Frank?

12:47.433 --> 12:48.633
-What was in the car?

12:48.667 --> 12:51.067
-There was--
There was pills in the car.

12:55.567 --> 12:57.467
-At least you were honest.
You owned up to it.

12:57.500 --> 13:00.933
Okay?
It's a bad decision.
You can learn from it.

13:00.967 --> 13:02.533
Move on, right?

13:04.933 --> 13:07.300
-Policeman:
The best part of policing,
I get to help people.

13:07.333 --> 13:08.867
You know, everybody,
like we've talked about,

13:08.900 --> 13:11.067
they wanna see
the foot chases
and the car chases

13:11.067 --> 13:13.600
and stuff, but that's
a pretty small part
of our job.

13:13.633 --> 13:15.200
Our job tends to be
helping people,

13:15.233 --> 13:17.133
and those are the stories
you remember when you get older.

13:17.167 --> 13:18.933
It gives my kids a sense
of pride.

13:18.967 --> 13:22.267
They really enjoy the fact
that, uh, I'm out here
helpin' people,

13:22.300 --> 13:25.367
and teachin' them, you know,
to help your community, servin'.

13:27.433 --> 13:30.733
We are headin' to a trespassin',
delayed right now.

13:30.767 --> 13:32.833
It's one of our
habitual drug offenders.

13:32.867 --> 13:35.667
He's been actin' strange
since yesterday.

13:35.700 --> 13:37.933
I guess he was out
screamin' in his yard.

13:37.967 --> 13:40.333
And like, now he's terrorizin'
the neighbors.

13:40.367 --> 13:41.800
They think he just
grabbed a female,

13:41.833 --> 13:43.833
so we're goin' to figure out
what's goin' on out here.

13:45.400 --> 13:47.767
-Bill!
-Mom had her hair...

13:47.800 --> 13:50.200
-What's goin' on, man?

13:50.233 --> 13:51.867
-They had--
They had her by the hair.

13:51.900 --> 13:53.267
-Who had your mom
by the hair?

13:53.300 --> 13:55.133
-I don't know.
Somebody up there.

13:55.167 --> 13:57.800
-We've already cleared
your house, buddy. There's
nobody in there, man.

13:57.833 --> 14:00.767
So who's yard are you in here
terrorizing saying--

14:00.800 --> 14:02.400
-I'm not tryin'
to terrorize nothin'.

14:02.433 --> 14:04.400
-Well, you're
definitely terrorizing
the neighborhood, buddy.

14:04.433 --> 14:06.800
-I mean, otherwise
I wouldn't be back
out here again.

14:06.833 --> 14:09.967
-Can you please clear--
clear the rest of the house?

14:10.067 --> 14:13.433
There's two entryways
that you didn't go up.
There's plenty of space.

14:13.467 --> 14:15.667
-Sure.
-And when I was lookin'
through the window,

14:15.700 --> 14:17.200
it was down.
-Okay.

14:17.233 --> 14:18.733
-I think I seen
somebody in there.

14:18.767 --> 14:22.167
Mom kind of vouched
for it, but Pat insisted
she went back in there.

14:22.200 --> 14:24.433
-Okay.
Whose house were you at
where you told 'em

14:24.467 --> 14:25.967
that if they didn't get you
a ride outta here,

14:26.067 --> 14:27.300
somethin' bad
was gonna happen?

14:27.333 --> 14:29.967
-No, I think-- Me?
I don't know what happened
to Danni,

14:30.067 --> 14:33.433
but, you know, she got--
-Danni. Your sister?

14:33.467 --> 14:35.067
-No, my girlfriend.
-I got you.

14:35.067 --> 14:38.567
-The guy Rob
in the red car.
He said, "I'll beat

14:38.600 --> 14:39.733
your girlfriend up
for you,"

14:39.767 --> 14:42.833
-All right.
-They put her in the car,
took off.

14:42.867 --> 14:45.933
-All right.
-I-- True story,
I don't know what happened...

14:45.967 --> 14:48.667
-Okay.
-(radio chatter)

14:48.700 --> 14:50.567
-What kind of, uh,
what kind of drugs
you use today, Bill?

14:50.600 --> 14:52.167
-I'm not--
Didn't use anything.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.400
-You used somethin', buddy,
let's be on the level
with each other.

14:54.433 --> 14:56.133
-I'm just very tried.
-I know Danielle very well,

14:56.167 --> 14:57.700
and if you're hangin' out
with Danielle,

14:57.733 --> 14:58.933
then, she's
heavily involved in meth.

14:58.967 --> 15:00.467
This is the fourth time
we've come out here.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.400
Your neighbors
are callin' us nonstop.
You've done wandered

15:02.433 --> 15:05.133
into two or three
people's yards.
Your mom said

15:05.167 --> 15:07.533
there's nothin' in the house,
we've been in the house.

15:07.567 --> 15:10.867
You have a history
of drug abuse, fair enough?

15:10.900 --> 15:12.867
So level with me,
what are you on
today, man?

15:12.900 --> 15:13.967
That's got you acting this way?

15:14.067 --> 15:15.200
-I haven't done
nothing at all today.

15:15.233 --> 15:17.067
-Okay, uh, today, well,
what about yesterday,

15:17.067 --> 15:19.867
or the last couple days?
-I don't know, I might've
did a pill, sir, that's it.

15:19.900 --> 15:22.367
-Just a pill?
'Cause you were out here
screamin' last night.

15:22.400 --> 15:26.167
-I'm not lying, sir.
Something was fishy
with Danni.

15:26.200 --> 15:28.933
-So what's this female,
you grabbed her hand out here?

15:28.967 --> 15:32.333
-No. My mom-- I didn't want her
goin' back in there.
-Okay, that's fine.

15:32.367 --> 15:34.967
-I just said-- But she insisted.
So I said, "Go ahead."

15:35.067 --> 15:36.867
-All right, Bill, let's
slide over to my car,
okay, buddy?

15:36.900 --> 15:38.467
Let me check you out
over here.
-I'm sorry, sir.

15:38.500 --> 15:40.533
-No, you're fine, man,
that's what we're here for.
But look...

15:40.567 --> 15:43.433
something's gotta give, man.
-I know what I heard and saw.
Everybody's trying to make me

15:43.467 --> 15:46.067
look like the bad guy.
-Nobody's trying to make you
look like anything, buddy.

15:46.100 --> 15:47.800
I'm just lettin' you know
what's goin' on, I mean...

15:47.833 --> 15:49.533
-I'm tryin'
to protect my family.
-When three or four

15:49.567 --> 15:51.733
of your neighbors are callin' me
'cause you're either
in their yard

15:51.767 --> 15:53.633
or out there
bangin' on their back door,
that's a problem.

15:53.667 --> 15:54.900
Put your hands up
on the car.

15:54.933 --> 15:56.333
Here's what
we're gonna do.
Until I figure out

15:56.367 --> 15:58.067
what's goin' on,
I'm gonna detain you.
Put your hands

15:58.067 --> 15:59.533
behind your back, okay?
You're not in trouble.

15:59.567 --> 16:01.300
But I don't know what's
goin' on, okay?

16:01.333 --> 16:02.800
We're becomin' a frequent
flyer out here.

16:02.833 --> 16:04.933
-Can you talk
to Mom about this?
-Well, I haven't talked to Mom,

16:04.967 --> 16:07.233
right now I wanna
get you restrained,
'cause you been actin' erratic,

16:07.267 --> 16:08.967
and I don't know
what's goin' on, man.

16:09.067 --> 16:10.433
And...
-I'm sorry.

16:10.467 --> 16:12.567
-No-- Hey, look--
Look, man--
-I'm worried about my mom

16:12.600 --> 16:14.400
and my girlfriend.
-Dude, I get it.
But I wanna find out

16:14.433 --> 16:16.633
what you got goin' on, okay?
Here's what I want you to do,

16:16.667 --> 16:20.067
have a seat in here, I'm gonna
go talk to your mom, okay?
Just have a seat.

16:22.833 --> 16:24.900
Two, go four.

16:24.933 --> 16:26.133
-Woman (over radio):
Two, go four.

16:26.167 --> 16:27.967
-(knocking on door)

16:28.067 --> 16:30.367
-(woman speaks indistinctly)
-It's me, it's Chris
with the Sheriff's Office,

16:30.400 --> 16:35.100
Will called us back out here.
-I can't open it.

16:35.133 --> 16:36.600
What?
-Hey.

16:36.633 --> 16:38.167
-Hi.
-Will is telling me
that there is somebody

16:38.200 --> 16:39.700
hiding out in the attic.

16:39.733 --> 16:42.800
-No, there's nobody
up in the attic.
-Okay, so has he even

16:42.833 --> 16:44.533
been back inside?
-I'm sorry?

16:44.567 --> 16:48.467
-Has Will been back in here?
Or is he just-- Is he still
acting kinda strange?

16:48.500 --> 16:50.267
-Yes.
-Okay.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.600
-He's nervous because
I'm by myself.
-Sure.

16:52.633 --> 16:55.167
But there's nobody inside?
You haven't had any issues
with anything like that?

16:55.200 --> 16:57.333
I gotta ask if he's tellin' me
that somebody's in there,
you know.

16:57.367 --> 17:00.133
-No, he's fine.
He's just worried about me.

17:00.167 --> 17:02.400
-Is he doin' drugs again?
I mean--
-No. No.

17:02.433 --> 17:04.500
-Have you seen him do anything?
'Cause he's actin' a little odd

17:04.533 --> 17:05.767
right now.
-Yeah, he's fine.

17:05.800 --> 17:07.400
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

17:07.433 --> 17:10.067
-Okay, we haven't
seen him do anything?
-Everything's okay, you know?

17:10.067 --> 17:12.400
-Okay.
-I just-- I don't understand.

17:12.433 --> 17:13.700
-Well, I'm gonna go talk
to the sisters

17:13.733 --> 17:14.967
and make sure
everybody's okay,

17:15.067 --> 17:16.500
and if you need us,
call us, okay?

17:16.533 --> 17:18.967
-I'm fine.
-All right, Miss.
Have a good evening, okay?

17:19.067 --> 17:21.600
-I appreciate you
checkin' on me, but--
-No problem, ma'am,

17:21.633 --> 17:24.300
well, we-- that's our job.
So we gotta come out
and make sure you're okay.

17:24.333 --> 17:29.067
-No, it's really-- It's-- It's--
You shouldn't have to do this
over somebody like me.

17:29.100 --> 17:32.767
-Just because I'm by myself.
-Oh, that's what we're here for.

17:32.800 --> 17:34.633
Well, who am I gonna
do it for if I don't do it
for you?

17:34.667 --> 17:37.067
-I'm sorry.
-I said who am I gonna do it
for if I don't do it for you,

17:37.067 --> 17:38.967
you know?
-Oh...

17:39.067 --> 17:41.200
-I gotta do it for somebody,
it might as well be you.

17:41.233 --> 17:43.133
-Yeah. (laughs)
-All right.

17:43.167 --> 17:44.533
Young lady, you have
a good evening, okay?

17:44.567 --> 17:46.600
-Oh, what's your name again?
-Chris. Chris Weaver.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.800
So was it you that he was
in the yard talkin' to?

17:50.833 --> 17:52.233
-Yes.
-What did he say?

17:52.267 --> 17:54.733
-He came-- Well, he came
up to my door,
-Okay.

17:54.767 --> 17:56.867
-and knocked on the door,
but nobody--
-And you live right here,

17:56.900 --> 17:58.233
correct?
-Right, I live right there.

17:58.267 --> 18:01.100
Normally, every once in a while,
Kim might come over, or Steven

18:01.133 --> 18:02.933
might come over
on the other side of me.
-Right.

18:02.967 --> 18:05.167
-So I went and answered
the door.
My dogs were barkin',

18:05.200 --> 18:07.900
and I didn't see anybody,
and me, I just happened
to open up the door.

18:07.933 --> 18:09.667
-Right.
-And there he was.

18:09.700 --> 18:11.367
-Just hangin' out
in your back yard?

18:11.400 --> 18:14.967
-Just hangin' right out there
in my carport, and he--
and he says,

18:15.067 --> 18:17.233
"Can you get me out
of the neighborhood?"

18:17.267 --> 18:19.700
-Okay, so you're the one
that he told to get out
of the neighborhood, okay.

18:19.733 --> 18:22.267
-Uh-huh. Yes.
He says, "Somebody's after me
-Sure.

18:22.300 --> 18:24.733
And it's not safe for me here,
and I need to get out
of the neighborhood."

18:24.767 --> 18:26.900
And I said, "I'm sorry,
I can't take you anywhere,"
I don't know,

18:26.933 --> 18:28.700
I'm-- I'm not
takin' him anywhere.
-I don't blame you.

18:28.733 --> 18:31.333
-Earlier this morning,
I don't know if it's
his girlfriend,

18:31.367 --> 18:33.933
he said her life
was in danger, and he was
on the way down to see

18:33.967 --> 18:37.700
this guy, which is a few--
I don't even know which one
it is.

18:37.733 --> 18:39.067
-Oh, I know him.
-Down that way.

18:39.100 --> 18:40.800
-Okay. (laughs)
-I know who they are.

18:40.833 --> 18:44.067
-You've been here before.
-I have. This isn't
my first rodeo on Gene Street.

18:44.067 --> 18:48.600
-And he says-- And then
when he comes back
he goes, "I, uh,

18:48.633 --> 18:50.600
I just went down there
and nobody's there,
and they took her,

18:50.633 --> 18:52.633
and I don't know
where they took her,"
and he goes, "I'm gonna

18:52.667 --> 18:54.167
have to get outta here,"
and I'm just, like--"

18:54.200 --> 18:56.067
-Okay.
-What is your--? (laughs)

18:56.067 --> 18:57.567
-Well, we're gonna
do something with him today,

18:57.600 --> 18:59.567
I'm gonna try
to get him some help.
-He needs somethin' more

18:59.600 --> 19:01.933
than short-term care,
that's for sure.

19:04.400 --> 19:07.367
-All right, well,
how you doin', buddy?
-Uh, hurtin' a little bit, sir.

19:07.400 --> 19:09.833
-Oh, what's hurtin' on you?
-My arms is just... cuffs.

19:09.867 --> 19:11.600
-Your arms?
All right, buddy, I'm gonna be
puttin' you

19:11.633 --> 19:13.633
under a Marchman Act.
You already told me
you were doin' drugs

19:13.667 --> 19:15.733
last night, all right?
I've got people sayin'
you thought demons

19:15.767 --> 19:18.100
were in the attic.
You're runnin' around here
with a baseball bat--

19:18.133 --> 19:20.067
-I never said that,
I carried the bat--

19:20.100 --> 19:21.900
-Will, let me talk
for a second.

19:21.933 --> 19:23.333
I gonna explain to you
what's gonna happen.

19:23.367 --> 19:24.567
You're not goin' to jail.
-Okay, sir.

19:24.600 --> 19:26.333
-However, you got
some stuff goin' on

19:26.367 --> 19:29.067
that you need
some treatment for.
Can we agree on that?

19:29.067 --> 19:31.467
You know, your family's--
-I'm worried about my family.

19:31.500 --> 19:33.200
-Well, your family's
worried about you.

19:33.233 --> 19:35.633
-Well, that's fine...
-And what we're gonna do
is we're gonna--

19:35.667 --> 19:37.467
he's gonna transport you
to a facility.

19:37.500 --> 19:40.300
We're gonna get you
some drug counseling,
get you some help,

19:40.333 --> 19:43.567
and see if we can't get you
off this stuff because, I think
you'd be much better

19:43.600 --> 19:45.367
when you're not on it.
Can we agree on that?

19:45.400 --> 19:48.633
-Yes, sir, I'll be off it...
-Okay, buddy.
All right, good luck, buddy.

19:49.800 --> 19:51.967
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:52.067 --> 19:53.933
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:53.967 --> 19:55.100
Cover is code three.

19:55.133 --> 19:58.100
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:04.400 --> 20:06.833
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:06.867 --> 20:09.467
-(theme music playing)
