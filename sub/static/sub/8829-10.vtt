17:48.433 --> 17:49.500
DO YOU NORMALLY BUY TICKETS

17:49.500 --> 17:50.833
ONLINE OR NO?

17:50.833 --> 17:52.033
>> NO, I BUY THEM RIGHT --

17:52.033 --> 17:52.600

17:52.600 --> 17:53.900
OKAY, SO WE SHOULD JUST STOP.

17:53.900 --> 17:57.933
WE SHOULD JUST STOP NOW.

17:57.933 --> 17:59.433

17:59.433 --> 18:00.900
TRAIN STATION, AND THAT MAKES

18:00.900 --> 18:02.067

18:02.067 --> 18:03.333
>> WE'RE BACK TO SCHOOL...

18:03.333 --> 18:04.433
FOR MURR'S PUNISHMENT.

18:04.433 --> 18:05.867
>> BEHIND US IS A ROOM FULL OF

18:05.867 --> 18:06.600
COLLEGE KIDS.

18:06.600 --> 18:07.800
MURR IS THEIR SUBSTITUTE

18:07.800 --> 18:08.333
TEACHER.

18:08.333 --> 18:09.800
HE'S GOT TO GIVE A PRESENTATION

18:09.800 --> 18:10.633
HE'S NEVER SEEN.

18:10.633 --> 18:11.900
>> WHAT'S THE TOPIC OF THE

18:11.900 --> 18:12.633
PRESENTATION?

18:12.633 --> 18:13.633
>> YOU'LL FIND OUT.

18:13.633 --> 18:14.400

18:35.067 --> 18:36.133
IS THIS THING WORKING?

18:36.133 --> 18:37.133
IT IS? OKAY, GREAT.

18:37.133 --> 18:38.433

18:38.433 --> 18:38.867
THING.

18:38.867 --> 18:40.200
IT'S ON HIS EYEBALL.

18:40.200 --> 18:41.467
>> HI, I'M JAMES, YOUR

18:41.467 --> 18:42.700
SUBSTITUTE PROFESSOR.

18:42.700 --> 18:44.433
SO, WE'VE GOT A SHORT PowerPoint

18:44.433 --> 18:45.567
PRESENTATION CALLED

18:45.567 --> 18:47.133
"SOCIAL NETWORKING AND YOU!"

18:47.133 --> 18:48.833
UH, OKAY, SO, A FEW FACTS ABOUT

18:48.833 --> 18:50.000
THE INTERNET.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.667
[ LAUGHTER ]

18:52.667 --> 18:54.500
[ Laughing ] THIS IS -- IT'S

18:54.500 --> 18:55.933
FUNNY, BUT IT'S TRUE.

18:55.933 --> 18:57.767
JESUS WAS THE FIRST BLOGGER.

18:57.767 --> 18:58.733
[ LAUGHTER ]

18:58.733 --> 19:00.633
>> LET'S SEE HIM GET THROUGH

19:00.633 --> 19:01.167
THIS.

19:01.167 --> 19:03.067
>> THINK ABOUT WHAT JESUS DID

19:03.067 --> 19:04.067
FOR A SECOND.

19:04.067 --> 19:05.433
HE SPREAD A MESSAGE.

19:05.433 --> 19:07.433
IS THERE ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

19:07.433 --> 19:08.833
JESUS AND A BLOGGER?

19:08.833 --> 19:10.567
THERE REALLY ISN'T, RIGHT?

19:10.567 --> 19:12.333
BLOGGERS ARE THE NEW JESUS!

19:12.333 --> 19:17.167
[ LAUGHTER ]

19:17.167 --> 19:19.433
TWO THINGS I AM CONSTANTLY DOING

19:19.433 --> 19:21.600
ONLINE -- FIRST, MAKING MONEY.

19:21.600 --> 19:23.500
THE SECOND THING IS CASUAL

19:23.500 --> 19:24.500
ENCOUNTERS.

19:24.500 --> 19:27.667
I OFTEN MAKE MONEY THROUGH

19:27.667 --> 19:28.900
CASUAL ENCOUNTERS.

19:28.900 --> 19:29.800
[ LAUGHTER ]

19:29.800 --> 19:31.700
>> HE WALKED HIMSELF INTO THAT

19:31.700 --> 19:32.167
ONE.

19:32.167 --> 19:34.000
>> MOVING ON.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.800
OKAY, THREE VOLUNTEERS FOR A

19:35.800 --> 19:36.867
DEMONSTRATION.

19:36.867 --> 19:37.700
COME ON UP.

19:37.733 --> 19:39.300
THANK YOU SO MUCH, GUYS.

19:39.333 --> 19:41.167
OKAY, SO, JUST A QUICK

19:41.167 --> 19:43.833
DEMONSTRATION...

19:43.833 --> 19:45.767
THAT WE WILL BEGIN NOW.

19:45.767 --> 19:46.967
[ LAUGHTER ]

19:46.967 --> 19:49.800
OKAY.

19:49.800 --> 19:53.133
SO, THE DEMONSTRATION IS THIS.

19:53.133 --> 19:54.233
IT'S VERY SIMPLE.

19:54.233 --> 19:55.067
[ LAUGHTER ]

19:55.067 --> 19:58.567
LET'S SAY THIS IS -- YOU'RE ON A

19:58.567 --> 19:59.633
SOCIAL-NETWORKING SITE.

19:59.633 --> 20:00.900
WHAT WOULD YOUR FIRST MESSAGE

20:00.900 --> 20:04.200
THAT YOU TYPE TO THEM BE?

20:04.200 --> 20:06.133
SO, THAT'S THE POWER OF

20:06.133 --> 20:07.100
INTERNET.

20:07.100 --> 20:09.933
GREAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

20:09.933 --> 20:11.600
MOVING ON.

20:11.600 --> 20:14.533
SO, SOCIAL NETWORKING IS BASED

20:14.533 --> 20:17.633
ON THE SAME EXACT CORE PRINCIPLE

20:17.633 --> 20:20.400
AS BIPOLAR MAGNETIC REVERSAL

20:20.400 --> 20:21.400
THEORY.

20:21.400 --> 20:24.900
[ LAUGHTER ]

20:24.900 --> 20:26.167
WHAT IS BILAR MAGNETIC

20:26.167 --> 20:27.100
REVERSAL THEORY?

20:27.100 --> 20:29.767
ANYONE KNOW?

20:29.767 --> 20:36.100
IS, UH...

20:36.100 --> 20:38.433
SO, BIPOLAR -- TWO OPPOSITE

20:38.433 --> 20:39.600
THINGS.

20:39.600 --> 20:41.133
REVERSAL...

20:41.133 --> 20:46.967
[ LAUGHTER ]

20:46.967 --> 20:48.800
SOCIAL NETWORKING IS THE SAME AS

20:48.800 --> 20:49.300
THAT.

20:49.300 --> 20:52.967
[ LAUGHTER ]

20:52.967 --> 20:57.967
OKAY, SO, "HOW TO MAKE CASH."

20:57.967 --> 20:59.967
SO, "SOCIAL NETWORKING EQUALS

20:59.967 --> 21:00.500
FARTS."

21:00.500 --> 21:01.433
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

21:01.433 --> 21:04.433
[ LAUGHTER ]

21:04.433 --> 21:05.300
A FART IS WHAT?

21:05.300 --> 21:06.733
IT SPREADS AND TAKES UP THE

21:06.733 --> 21:08.133
ENTIRE ROOM, AND SUDDENLY,

21:08.133 --> 21:09.333
THERE'S NO ESCAPING IT.

21:09.333 --> 21:10.333
YOU CAN'T SEE IT.

21:10.333 --> 21:11.900
IT'S EVERYWHERE. IT'S INVISIBLE.

21:11.900 --> 21:13.500
IS NOT THE INTERNET THE SAME AS

21:13.533 --> 21:14.733
A FART?

21:14.733 --> 21:20.067
[ LAUGHTER ]

21:20.067 --> 21:22.067
I HOPE THIS HAS BEEN ENJOYABLE

21:22.067 --> 21:23.400
FOR ALL OF YOU, SO THANK YOU SO

21:23.400 --> 21:23.767
MUCH.

21:23.767 --> 21:25.033
AND THAT IS SOCIAL NETWORKING
