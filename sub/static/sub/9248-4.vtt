WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:05.048
It's fun going
grocery shopping together.

00:05.135 --> 00:07.529
Yeah, I love this!

00:07.616 --> 00:09.531
You know, you could
have just stayed home

00:09.618 --> 00:10.575
and watched
a football game.

00:10.662 --> 00:12.925
Could I, Molly?
Could I?

00:13.013 --> 00:17.234
Oh, my God, I think
that's J.C. Small.

00:17.321 --> 00:18.583
Who's J.C. Small?

00:18.670 --> 00:19.845
Janice Corb Small.

00:19.932 --> 00:21.108
She wrote
Misbegotten Summer.

00:21.195 --> 00:23.240
The book defined
my teenage years.

00:23.327 --> 00:25.112
Huh. Mine were defined by
a Pirelli Tire calendar.

00:25.199 --> 00:28.680
It was June before I could
say good-bye to Miss January.

00:28.767 --> 00:30.160
I'm not sure
if it's her.

00:30.247 --> 00:32.119
She's a bit of a recluse.

00:33.163 --> 00:34.904
J.C.!

00:34.991 --> 00:36.949
[whispers]:
Did she look? Did she look?

00:37.037 --> 00:40.388
I wasn't watching.
We got a hinky wheel.

00:40.475 --> 00:42.477
It wants to go left every time.
See? Look.

00:42.564 --> 00:43.956
Shh. Shh-shh! Come here.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.915
Is that who you're
talking about?

00:46.002 --> 00:49.745
Stop pointing!
What are you doing? Come here.

00:49.832 --> 00:51.964
Okay, should I go in
and say something to her?

00:52.052 --> 00:54.489
You'll regret it if you don't.

00:54.576 --> 00:56.143
I peed next to Mike Ditka
at Taste of Chicago.

00:56.230 --> 00:59.494
All I could do was stare
at his Super Bowl ring.

00:59.581 --> 01:01.974
I think I kind
of creeped him out.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.063
I'm going.
I'm gonna go for it.

01:09.069 --> 01:12.681
Oh, vodka, vodka,
vodka, huh?

01:12.768 --> 01:17.164
So many choices of vodka.

01:17.251 --> 01:19.079
Ooh, have you ever had
this brand?

01:19.166 --> 01:22.125
I've had 'em all.

01:22.212 --> 01:24.606
Do you have a favorite brand?

01:28.218 --> 01:30.742
I love 'em all equally.

01:30.829 --> 01:33.919
I know who you are!

01:34.006 --> 01:34.920
Terrific.
Yeah.

01:35.007 --> 01:36.879
See ya.
Yeah, see ya.

01:36.966 --> 01:38.010
Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait,
Ms. Small,

01:38.098 --> 01:40.100
I have to, I have to tell you

01:40.187 --> 01:42.624
that Misbegotten Summer
changed my life.

01:42.711 --> 01:45.192
Well, thank you.
That's very kind.
Yeah.

01:45.279 --> 01:47.019
Yeah. Could you get
your hand off my cart?

01:47.107 --> 01:48.543
[laughs]

01:48.630 --> 01:50.327
Yeah, since I have you,
can I just ask

01:50.414 --> 01:52.938
if you have any little
piece of advice

01:53.025 --> 01:55.027
for an aspiring writer?

01:55.115 --> 01:56.812
Mm!

01:56.899 --> 02:00.163
Uh, sure. Grow up in a household
of abusive alcoholics.

02:00.250 --> 02:04.428
God, my mom's kind
of a happy drunk!

02:04.515 --> 02:06.474
Well, give her time.
We all start off happy.

02:06.561 --> 02:07.910
You know what?

02:07.997 --> 02:09.607
If you really want
to be a writer,

02:09.694 --> 02:11.218
maybe you should just go home
and write.

02:14.090 --> 02:16.223
"Go home and write."Go home and write.

02:16.310 --> 02:18.616
Wow, it's so simple,
it's profound.
Yeah, yeah.

02:18.703 --> 02:21.271
Thank you. Wow.You're welcome.

02:21.358 --> 02:22.490
You're so welcome.
Yeah.

02:22.577 --> 02:23.795
Move.

02:23.882 --> 02:25.797
I will.

02:25.884 --> 02:27.321
Thank you.

02:27.408 --> 02:30.280
Oh, my cart does
the same thing!
It does!

02:36.156 --> 02:37.374
Did you see that?

02:37.461 --> 02:38.375
Did you see this?

02:38.462 --> 02:40.638

03:09.406 --> 03:11.191
Now this'll just take a minute.

03:11.278 --> 03:12.975
I want to
make sure my mom's okay.

03:13.062 --> 03:14.498
Well, why-why
wouldn't she be?

03:14.585 --> 03:15.934
One of her bingo friends died
yesterday.

03:16.021 --> 03:18.154
Aw, that's sad.

03:18.241 --> 03:20.548
Yeah, she just won
a HoneyBaked ham, too.

03:20.635 --> 03:22.376
Well, she went out
a winner.

03:25.683 --> 03:27.119
What?

03:27.207 --> 03:28.860
What do you mean, "What?"

03:28.947 --> 03:30.775
You don't return my calls.
I'm worried about you.

03:30.862 --> 03:31.776
Nothing to be worried about.

03:31.863 --> 03:33.038
Come on in. I got ham.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.478
I do love bingo ham.

03:37.565 --> 03:39.784
Why is it so dark in here?

03:39.871 --> 03:42.134
I'm practicing
for when I'm dead.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.267
Ma, don't be that way.

03:44.354 --> 03:47.227
Nobody gets out
of here alive, Mikey!

03:47.314 --> 03:49.011
She's fine.

03:49.098 --> 03:52.188
Here. Eat it before it rots.

03:52.275 --> 03:53.885
A fate that awaits us all.

03:53.972 --> 03:55.452
So true, so true.

03:55.539 --> 03:56.584
You got mustard?

03:56.671 --> 03:59.282
Carl!

03:59.369 --> 04:00.631
Ma, you can't give in
to this depression.

04:00.718 --> 04:02.242
I know you miss your friend.Friend?

04:02.329 --> 04:05.157
I couldn't stand
that godless whore.

04:05.245 --> 04:09.161
Well, if you hated her so much,
why are you upset?

04:09.249 --> 04:12.513
Sat next to her
at bingo for 12 years.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.254
Never had a kind word
to say to each other.

04:14.341 --> 04:18.388
Last night, right before
she died, she took my hand,

04:18.475 --> 04:22.436
looked into my eyes
and said, "You're next."

04:22.523 --> 04:25.439
Well, I'm sure she didn't mean
anything by it.

04:25.526 --> 04:26.657
Really?

04:26.744 --> 04:27.223
Sounded kind of
specific to me.

04:27.310 --> 04:30.095
Carl!

04:30.182 --> 04:32.881
Why don't you come over
for dinner on Sunday?

04:32.968 --> 04:34.012
It'll cheer you up.

04:34.099 --> 04:36.885
Uch! Those people are awful.

04:36.972 --> 04:37.233
What time?

04:44.284 --> 04:46.155
Oh!

04:47.635 --> 04:50.115
Well, there's a cry for help.

04:57.601 --> 04:59.124
[clattering]

04:59.211 --> 05:00.343
Hang on, Calvin!

05:00.430 --> 05:03.607
I got some
other bottles for you!

05:03.694 --> 05:06.654
Oh, you're not
my homeless guy.

05:06.741 --> 05:08.308
No, I'm not.

05:08.395 --> 05:10.571
I'm Molly from yesterday.

05:10.658 --> 05:12.312
The supermarket.

05:12.399 --> 05:14.139
You told me to go away
and leave you alone.

05:14.226 --> 05:17.534
How the hell did you find out
where I live?

05:17.621 --> 05:20.145
Well, I may have
followed you home,

05:20.232 --> 05:21.973
but not in a stalkery way.

05:22.060 --> 05:24.759
Like a kind of "I'm your
biggest fan!" kind of way.

05:24.846 --> 05:26.587
Which is a little stalkery,

05:26.674 --> 05:28.240
but I'm just gonna, I'm gonna
stop saying stalkery.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.939
So wait, wait! Come on!

05:31.026 --> 05:33.594
I took your advice.
I stayed up all night writing,

05:33.681 --> 05:36.597
and I just want you to take
a look at it and tell me

05:36.684 --> 05:37.815
if I'm wasting my time!

05:37.902 --> 05:39.643
You're wasting
your time.

05:39.730 --> 05:41.645
Oh! Ow! God!

05:41.732 --> 05:42.429
Get your foot out!

05:42.516 --> 05:44.256
[clattering]

05:46.520 --> 05:50.262
You ruined my system.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.569
Come on. I know
it's a lot to ask,

05:52.656 --> 05:54.354
but I-I just want
to be able to say one thing

05:54.441 --> 05:58.096
to try to convince you
that I really want
to be a writer.

05:58.183 --> 05:59.184
One thing.

06:01.491 --> 06:02.362
That's the thing.

06:06.017 --> 06:07.584
Is this really
necessary?

06:07.671 --> 06:09.194
After I saw
the pitiful state
your mom was in,

06:09.281 --> 06:11.414
I got worried.[conga drums playing]

06:11.501 --> 06:12.459
Grandma!

06:12.546 --> 06:14.069
That music's awful loud.

06:14.156 --> 06:15.853
I mean, if she fell
or had a heart attack,

06:15.940 --> 06:17.159
nobody could hear
her yell for help.

06:17.246 --> 06:18.160
Take it easy.

06:18.247 --> 06:19.683
Youtake it easy.

06:19.770 --> 06:21.816
Last time we talked,
it was a fight.

06:21.903 --> 06:23.165
Last time you talked
to anybody, it was a fight!

06:23.252 --> 06:25.210
Grandma!

06:25.297 --> 06:27.996
Can I help you?

06:28.083 --> 06:29.650
What is going on?

06:29.737 --> 06:30.781
I'm out here knocking
like a crazy person.

06:30.868 --> 06:31.869
Sorry, we saw
the police car.

06:31.956 --> 06:34.132
We didn't know
it was you.

06:34.219 --> 06:35.786
"We" who?

06:35.873 --> 06:37.440
Some members
of our sister church

06:37.527 --> 06:39.050
are visiting from Uganda.

06:39.137 --> 06:42.619
And damn if those Africans
don't know how to party.

06:42.706 --> 06:44.099
Party? It's 11:00 a.m.

06:44.186 --> 06:45.230
Not in Africa.

06:45.317 --> 06:46.536
Let's go, Carl.

06:46.623 --> 06:47.842
Bye, Nana.
Enjoy your party.

06:47.929 --> 06:49.713
Okay.

06:50.366 --> 06:53.587
Oh... this is awkward.

06:53.674 --> 06:55.458
Samuel, what the hell
are you doing here?

06:55.545 --> 06:57.112
Come on in, child.

06:57.199 --> 06:59.201
I got a lot of good
Christian African girls

06:59.288 --> 07:01.029
waiting to meet you.

07:01.116 --> 07:02.465
I love your grandmother.

07:02.552 --> 07:05.686
How are you gonna
invite him to the party

07:05.773 --> 07:07.514
but not your own grandson?

07:07.601 --> 07:09.341
I like him better.

07:13.345 --> 07:15.304
Huh.

07:15.391 --> 07:18.612
Is that-Is that like a Hmm?
or like a Huh!

07:19.917 --> 07:22.137
I'm gonna, I'm gonna just stop.

07:22.224 --> 07:23.181
You... I'm gonna let you read.

07:23.268 --> 07:25.793
I'm done.And?

07:25.880 --> 07:26.968
Loved it.

07:27.055 --> 07:29.361
No!
Oh, yeah.

07:29.449 --> 07:32.103
Your use of language
is a cross between

07:32.190 --> 07:35.019
Virginia Woolf
and early Dean Koontz.

07:35.106 --> 07:36.847
I knew it. Oh, my God,
what do I do now?

07:36.934 --> 07:39.241
I mean, do I get an agent?
Oh, I gotta get a publisher.

07:39.328 --> 07:40.764
No, you don't have
to do anything.

07:40.851 --> 07:42.810
With writing that good,
they're gonna find you.

07:42.897 --> 07:44.899
Oh, my God!
That's awesome!

07:44.986 --> 07:46.770
Yeah.
Oh, my God.

07:46.857 --> 07:49.207
I want a big, big thank you
on that dedication page...

07:49.294 --> 07:50.600
Okay.
...all right?

07:50.687 --> 07:51.601
Okay.
All right.

07:51.688 --> 07:53.385
All right. Bye.

07:56.127 --> 07:57.346
You're not, you're not
just saying it's good

07:57.433 --> 07:59.653
to get rid of me?

08:02.351 --> 08:05.397
No...

08:05.485 --> 08:07.225
Okay, I am not leaving

08:07.312 --> 08:08.705
until you give me
your honest opinion.

08:08.792 --> 08:10.185
You don't want it.

08:10.272 --> 08:11.752
I gave up everything
to be a writer.

08:11.839 --> 08:13.928
Oof.

08:14.015 --> 08:15.277
Okay, it can't be that bad.

08:15.364 --> 08:18.410
Did you read it?

08:18.498 --> 08:20.717
Of course I read it. I wrote it.

08:20.804 --> 08:23.154
Well, that's the problem, you
wrote it. You didn't live it.

08:23.241 --> 08:24.504
There's nothing real in
those pages. Nothing.

08:24.591 --> 08:26.157
Are you kidding?!

08:26.244 --> 08:28.595
What could be more real
than a young Punjabi boy

08:28.682 --> 08:31.989
struggling in the slums
of Mumbai?!

08:32.076 --> 08:34.688
The opening paragraph was the
worst writing I've ever read.

08:34.775 --> 08:37.691
If I could gouge out my eyeballs
and stuff them up my ass

08:37.778 --> 08:40.041
so I never had
to read those words again,

08:40.128 --> 08:41.695
I would do so.

08:41.782 --> 08:43.348
So are you, are you saying
cut the first,

08:43.435 --> 08:45.699
cut the first paragraph?

08:45.786 --> 08:47.657
I am saying...

08:47.744 --> 08:49.267
Oh, God, it drives me crazy,

08:49.354 --> 08:51.052
people that think they're
writers just 'cause

08:51.139 --> 08:53.141
they have a fancy laptop
and a cushy seat in Starbucks.

08:53.228 --> 08:54.708
Hey, for your information,

08:54.795 --> 08:57.101
my laptop is running
Windows '95.

08:57.188 --> 08:59.495
And I wrote this at
my mom's kitchen table

08:59.582 --> 09:02.237
because I still live with her.

09:02.324 --> 09:03.804
How old are you?

09:03.891 --> 09:08.417
Like, early, middle-late,
late-early 30s.

09:08.504 --> 09:12.116
And you are still living
with your mother?

09:12.203 --> 09:13.901
Not in a weird way.

09:13.988 --> 09:17.426
I'm with my husband and her
husband and my sister.

09:17.513 --> 09:19.471
Well, for God's sake,
forget about Mumbai!

09:19.559 --> 09:22.387
Write about your own
pathetic life.

09:23.606 --> 09:26.391
Right! God, you're good!

09:26.478 --> 09:28.480
I mean, I got tons of pathetic!

09:28.568 --> 09:30.918
You've gotta dig deep.
You know,

09:31.005 --> 09:32.615
people say that you should
write about

09:32.702 --> 09:34.617
what you know,
but that's bull.

09:34.704 --> 09:38.403
You want to write what
you don'twant people to know.

09:38.490 --> 09:39.709
Okay, hang on,
hang on.

09:39.796 --> 09:41.798
"Don't want..."Want people to know.

09:41.885 --> 09:43.191
Ooh, ooh!
People to know.

09:43.278 --> 09:44.366
"...people to know."

09:44.453 --> 09:46.411
That's right.

09:46.498 --> 09:48.500
So I don't want to
see your face again

09:48.588 --> 09:50.415
till you bring me
something deep,
something good,

09:50.502 --> 09:52.722
something real,
and a bigger bottle of vodka.

09:52.809 --> 09:57.988
Okay, so no, no face,
bigger bottle.

09:58.075 --> 09:59.903
Okay.
All right.

09:59.990 --> 10:01.383
Write. Write.Right. Oh, right.

10:01.470 --> 10:03.211
Write.
Okay.

10:03.298 --> 10:05.082
Oh, wait-wait-wait.

10:05.169 --> 10:07.911
Um, actually, sorry.

10:07.998 --> 10:09.913
I don't know how
this got in there,

10:10.000 --> 10:12.829
but it's...

10:12.916 --> 10:15.223
I didn't think you were
gonna let me...

10:15.310 --> 10:15.571
Get out!
Okay.

10:22.709 --> 10:26.408
It was amazing.
She completely dismantled me.

10:26.495 --> 10:28.062
Just tore me down.

10:28.149 --> 10:29.977
And the next minute,
built me right back up.

10:30.064 --> 10:32.719
You know, it takes them six
months to do that to a Marine.

10:32.806 --> 10:34.459
She did it to me
in one bottle of vodka.

10:34.546 --> 10:36.505
So she likes your story?

10:36.592 --> 10:40.552
No, hated it with every fiber
of her being.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.730
Okay, I'm confused.
Why are you happy?

10:43.817 --> 10:45.427
Because she told me exactly

10:45.514 --> 10:47.385
what I have to do
to become a better writer.

10:47.472 --> 10:48.038
I have to dig deeper.

10:48.125 --> 10:48.865
Where?

10:48.952 --> 10:50.867
Here and here.

10:50.954 --> 10:53.348
And all up in here.

10:53.435 --> 10:56.046
Did you ever wonder why we
still live with my mother?

10:56.133 --> 10:58.135
Every day.

10:58.222 --> 10:59.963
I mean, I used to think
it was because we couldn't

11:00.050 --> 11:01.573
afford a place of our own.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.314
Well, we can't.

11:03.401 --> 11:05.403
You quit your job and we have
a ton of credit card debt.

11:05.490 --> 11:06.709
I'm talking emotionally.

11:06.796 --> 11:08.668
Numbers mean nothing.

11:08.755 --> 11:10.060
It's six maxed-out cards.

11:10.147 --> 11:12.846
That's about 80 grand
away from nothing.

11:12.933 --> 11:14.369
Well, I...

11:14.456 --> 11:15.718
I need to start asking
the hard questions.

11:15.805 --> 11:17.111
I mean, why am
I still in O.A.?

11:17.198 --> 11:18.852
Why is Victoria a pothead?

11:18.939 --> 11:21.158
And whatever really happened
to weird Uncle Frankie?

11:21.245 --> 11:23.813
You had a weird Uncle Frankie?
I had a weird Uncle Frankie.

11:23.900 --> 11:26.250
[laughs]
Yeah, mine had a wonky eye

11:26.337 --> 11:28.775
and drove this
beat-up old Cadillac.

11:28.862 --> 11:30.820
So did mine.

11:33.344 --> 11:34.694
Okay, that's enough
questions for tonight.Yeah.

11:44.138 --> 11:45.574
I love this Zumba.

11:45.661 --> 11:47.968
Doesn't feel like a workout.

11:48.055 --> 11:49.317
It's more like we're
dancing at a club.

11:49.404 --> 11:51.319
All that's missing is
a coked-up Persian

11:51.406 --> 11:54.931
trying to give me
a ride home.

11:55.018 --> 11:57.020
Hey, sweetie.

11:57.107 --> 11:58.674
Care to get your
Merengue on?

11:58.761 --> 12:01.503
Um, not really, I got a
lot on my mind right now.

12:01.590 --> 12:03.592
Want to talk about it?

12:03.679 --> 12:05.681
Yeah, actually, I do.

12:05.768 --> 12:09.032
Think that could be
really helpful.

12:13.341 --> 12:15.343
Okay, uh...

12:15.430 --> 12:18.128
I've been, I've been thinking a
lot about my childhood lately.

12:18.215 --> 12:20.522
What the hell you
doing that for?

12:20.609 --> 12:21.697
Because when your mentor tells
you to "dig deep,"

12:21.784 --> 12:23.612
by God, you dig deep.

12:23.699 --> 12:26.354
And... dig deep.

12:28.312 --> 12:30.314
Well, for the most part
you were a happy kid.

12:30.401 --> 12:31.272
Yeah? Really?

12:31.359 --> 12:32.490
Well, almost too happy.

12:32.577 --> 12:33.796
For a while
there we thought

12:33.883 --> 12:35.102
you were one of
those slow kids.

12:35.189 --> 12:37.713
Always smiling,
hugging strangers.

12:37.800 --> 12:40.716
You'd sit in the backyard
for hours just eating dirt.

12:40.803 --> 12:42.718
You let me, you let me eat dirt?

12:42.805 --> 12:45.329
Like, like dirt dirt?

12:45.416 --> 12:46.853
The body knows what it needs.

12:47.897 --> 12:50.334
The thing I feel really bad
about is the dog.

12:50.421 --> 12:51.640
Monroe?Yeah.

12:51.727 --> 12:53.337
We got rid of him
'cause we thought

12:53.424 --> 12:55.557
he was the one making
all the holes in the yard.

12:55.644 --> 12:58.995
You told me he
got hit by a car.

12:59.082 --> 13:00.127
Well, if I said he was
living on a farm,

13:00.214 --> 13:01.693
you'd want to go visit him.

13:01.781 --> 13:05.480
Well, then, who did
we bury in the box?

13:05.567 --> 13:08.135
That horrible doll that wouldn't
quit asking for its mama.

13:08.222 --> 13:09.701
You killed
Sleepy Time Baby Girl?

13:17.884 --> 13:20.234
Hey, Ma.
You feeling better today?

13:20.321 --> 13:22.540
I put the potatoes in the
oven and not my head.

13:22.627 --> 13:24.978
So there's that.

13:25.065 --> 13:26.762
There's that great

13:26.849 --> 13:28.851
suicide-based sense of humor.

13:28.938 --> 13:31.332
I'll go heat these up.

13:31.419 --> 13:33.029
Hey!

13:33.116 --> 13:34.814
Mother Biggs.

13:34.901 --> 13:36.337
What's going on?

13:36.424 --> 13:36.816
My friend died.

13:39.253 --> 13:40.689
You had a friend?

13:43.518 --> 13:46.086
My condolences.

13:48.523 --> 13:51.656
Bit of a cold snap
we're having, huh?

13:51.743 --> 13:54.834
Don't feel you need to make
conversation on my account.

13:54.921 --> 13:57.749
Good, 'cause that kind
of tapped me out.

14:00.013 --> 14:02.754
The more I dig,
the clearer it becomes.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.974
My mother ruined my childhood.

14:05.061 --> 14:06.149
What are you talking about?

14:06.236 --> 14:07.063
You turned out fine.

14:07.150 --> 14:08.673
Yeah, did I, Mike?

14:08.760 --> 14:10.980
Did I?

14:11.067 --> 14:13.287
I was gonna say yes,
but you asked twice.

14:13.374 --> 14:15.332
So now I'm rethinking my answer.

14:15.419 --> 14:18.161
I thought you wanted
to dig up some dirt.I did.

14:18.248 --> 14:19.989
But I didn't think
I'd be the one eating it.

14:20.076 --> 14:22.992
I mean, who knows what else
she's been lying about?

14:23.079 --> 14:25.125
I mean, she told me
I had to quit tap-dancing

14:25.212 --> 14:26.735
after I got my period
because she said

14:26.822 --> 14:28.780
it would scramble my ovaries.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.871
Is that true?

14:31.958 --> 14:34.134
I don't know!

14:34.221 --> 14:36.179
I don't know anything anymore.

14:36.266 --> 14:38.573
I mean, I don't know, am I even
really allergic to mushrooms?

14:38.660 --> 14:40.357
I... Probably not, here.

14:40.444 --> 14:41.576
Well, I...

14:41.663 --> 14:43.012
No, nothing.

14:43.099 --> 14:45.580
No, I'm getting it.
[muttering]

14:45.667 --> 14:47.799
Do you need a Benadryl
or something?

14:48.800 --> 14:50.193
[hacking]

14:50.280 --> 14:51.978
Here, here, here,
here, here, here.

14:52.065 --> 14:54.110
Down, down, down, down.

14:54.197 --> 14:56.634
[mumbling gibberish]

14:56.721 --> 14:58.723
Oh, oh, okay, okay, okay!

15:00.987 --> 15:03.815
Okay, everybody.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.905
Let's eat.

15:09.125 --> 15:10.822
Dear Lord.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.611
We thank you for
this wonderful bounty.

15:16.698 --> 15:19.353
Tonight I ask that you
hold me in your grace

15:19.440 --> 15:22.443
and not judge me because
of the company I keep.

15:22.530 --> 15:24.053
Amen.

15:24.140 --> 15:25.881
Can you pass the rolls?

15:25.968 --> 15:27.796
Yeah, sure, can you tell me
who my real father was?

15:27.883 --> 15:30.277
What are you talking about?

15:30.364 --> 15:31.887
Look at us, okay?

15:31.974 --> 15:34.107
One of these things
is not like the other.

15:34.194 --> 15:35.630
So, who's the mutt, Mom?

15:35.717 --> 15:36.979
Is her father on the
farm with Monroe?

15:37.066 --> 15:37.937
Or weird Uncle Frankie?

15:38.024 --> 15:39.329
My brother Frankie?

15:39.416 --> 15:41.897
Different Frankie, Ma.
Let it go.

15:41.984 --> 15:44.030
Mom, what's
she talking about?

15:44.117 --> 15:45.379
I have no idea.

15:45.466 --> 15:46.858
I was faithful
to your father.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.165
That sweet angel was cold
in the ground

15:49.252 --> 15:50.906
before I got back on that horse.

15:50.993 --> 15:53.082
Yeah, or under it.

15:53.169 --> 15:55.041
Hey! I was still a young woman.

15:55.128 --> 15:57.304
What was I supposed to do,
put a cork in it?

15:57.391 --> 15:59.088
I saw that once in Tijuana.

15:59.175 --> 16:01.438
Pass the green beans.

16:01.525 --> 16:02.962
And what about my issues
with food?

16:03.049 --> 16:04.659
Or the-the fact
that I still live here?

16:04.746 --> 16:05.529
Or my poor choices in men?

16:05.616 --> 16:07.575
Hey!Not you.

16:07.662 --> 16:09.316
The chorus line
of gay guys before you.

16:09.403 --> 16:11.535
Okay, that's fair.

16:11.622 --> 16:13.711
Okay, it all traces back
to one little redhead.

16:13.798 --> 16:16.758
Who I don't look like,
and neither does she.

16:16.845 --> 16:17.846
Are you my mother?!

16:17.933 --> 16:20.849
Oh, shut up!

16:20.936 --> 16:22.416
No, we're not gonna shut up!

16:22.503 --> 16:23.895
We've been silent too long!

16:23.983 --> 16:25.897
The only time
you've been silent

16:25.985 --> 16:27.508
is when you had
dirt in your mouth.

16:27.595 --> 16:29.162
Why'd you think I let you
eat half the backyard?

16:29.249 --> 16:30.598
Because you were drunk!

16:30.685 --> 16:32.208
'Cause you were
a pain in the ass!

16:32.295 --> 16:33.818
Yeah, did you ever ask why?

16:33.905 --> 16:36.473
You want to know why?!

16:36.560 --> 16:37.431
Screw you, that's why!

16:37.518 --> 16:39.694
You threw a roll at me?

16:39.781 --> 16:41.000
Couldn't reach the potatoes!

16:41.087 --> 16:42.175
Yeah? Well, let me help you!

16:42.262 --> 16:44.090
MIKE:
Hey, hey, hey!

16:44.177 --> 16:47.223
I haven't had any yet.

16:47.310 --> 16:49.443
Aah!

16:49.530 --> 16:50.618
What did I do?

16:50.705 --> 16:51.662
You married her and you won't

16:51.749 --> 16:53.186
get her out of the house!

16:53.273 --> 16:54.622
It's 'cause she's horrible
with money!

16:54.709 --> 16:55.840
Hey!

16:55.927 --> 16:56.972
You stay out of this!

16:57.059 --> 16:58.234
Well, what about me?!

16:58.321 --> 16:59.322
I'm part of this family, too!

16:59.409 --> 17:01.063
Aren't I?!Shut up!

17:01.150 --> 17:03.065
Oh, my...

17:03.152 --> 17:05.720
[all clamoring]

17:05.807 --> 17:07.765
Damn it, I choose life!

17:12.422 --> 17:13.945
[yells][screams]

17:16.644 --> 17:17.906
Help!

17:22.824 --> 17:25.131
God, it was awful.
My whole family hates me.

17:25.218 --> 17:26.132
Mm.

17:26.219 --> 17:27.959
Congratulations.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.788
That's the first step
in becoming a real writer.

17:30.875 --> 17:35.358
I haven't talked
to my family in four books.

17:35.445 --> 17:37.317
Oh, God, that's so sad.Mm.

17:37.404 --> 17:40.059
No, it's much better to be loved
by millions of readers

17:40.146 --> 17:43.279
than six people who happened
to fall out of the same vagina.

17:43.366 --> 17:45.847
Big family.

17:45.934 --> 17:47.022
Big vagina.

17:49.938 --> 17:51.635
Yeah, I just, you know,

17:51.722 --> 17:52.636
the thing is I...

17:52.723 --> 17:54.508
I kind of love my family.

17:54.595 --> 17:55.813
I thought you wanted
to be a writer?

17:55.900 --> 17:57.163
Oh, I do.

17:57.250 --> 17:59.687
Well, then this is
your new family.

17:59.774 --> 18:01.558
It may not have
much personality,

18:01.645 --> 18:04.474
but it won't molest you
when you get your boobies.

18:04.561 --> 18:06.476
Oh, God!

18:06.563 --> 18:07.825
Sorry.

18:07.912 --> 18:09.349
That's all right, I mean,

18:09.436 --> 18:11.090
everybody's got
a weird uncle, right?

18:14.223 --> 18:16.225
I don't know, I'm just
not really that comfortable

18:16.312 --> 18:19.750
airing my family's
dirty laundry.

18:19.837 --> 18:21.230
Aw, you know what?

18:21.317 --> 18:23.058
We don't have
to talk about it anymore.

18:23.145 --> 18:24.146
I mean, you've had
a pretty rough day.

18:24.233 --> 18:26.844
Yeah.You should just relax.

18:26.931 --> 18:28.542
[chuckling]

18:28.629 --> 18:30.457
You got potato
in your hair still.

18:30.544 --> 18:31.849
Oh, I know.

18:31.936 --> 18:35.897
Oh, my God.
[chuckles]

18:37.855 --> 18:39.553
Look at that.

18:39.640 --> 18:42.251
Look at that sweet face.
Oh, my.

18:42.338 --> 18:43.383
There it is.

18:43.470 --> 18:44.775
Okay, yup, yup.

18:44.862 --> 18:46.951
Little dimples there! Aw!Yup, yup.

18:47.038 --> 18:49.171
Look at that...

18:49.258 --> 18:50.346
Yes, thank you.

18:50.433 --> 18:52.043
Yeah. Oh, yeah.Thank you.

18:59.312 --> 19:01.531
Well, you know,
if you wanted to clean up,

19:01.618 --> 19:02.053
we could take a bath.
