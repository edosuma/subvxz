- No.

24:42.189 --> 24:46.692
Twin-masted brigantine out of
Charleston during the Civil War.

24:47.319 --> 24:50.404
MURPHY: She was bound for London
with a cargo of cotton.

24:50.572 --> 24:51.822
Thanks.

24:53.325 --> 24:57.786
Two months after she set sail, she was
sighted by fishermen off Tripoli.

24:57.996 --> 25:01.207
She was doing 12 knots an hour
in a stiff breeze.

25:01.958 --> 25:07.880
Something wasrt quite right. They
didn't know what so they went onboard.

25:08.673 --> 25:10.841
You know what they found?

Nothing.

25:15.847 --> 25:19.391
No passengers. No crew. No captain.

25:20.560 --> 25:22.186
No sign of distress.

25:22.938 --> 25:29.235
59 days after the last log entry, it had
traveled 4500 miles across the ocean...

25:29.402 --> 25:35.533
...past the Rock of Gibraltar and into
the Mediterranean Sea at full sail.

25:37.118 --> 25:38.994

26:04.729 --> 26:07.398
So, what's our plan?

26:07.566 --> 26:11.402

to do. Tie her up, tug her in.

this ocean liner?

Not with the problems we got.

26:19.411 --> 26:23.622
We could set her at anchor
and come back with two or three tugs.

26:23.790 --> 26:26.417
No, some Russian trawler
will come along.

26:26.626 --> 26:30.629
I've already looked for her anchors,
anyway. They're gone.

- What do you think?
- Get the engines working...

26:33.967 --> 26:38.137
...it could take us two weeks
minimum to tow a vessel this size.

26:38.346 --> 26:42.641

I'd drag her back to Anchorage myself.

- Did it hit an iceberg?

29:08.329 --> 29:10.914

to rupture a hull.

That's if the weather holds.

if we can get to the inside.
