19:43.280 --> 19:44.372
IS GONNA DO THE TRICK WHEN

19:44.380 --> 19:45.608
LEAVING HER 5 MESSAGES DIDN'T?

19:45.610 --> 19:46.508
Liz: SOPHIA SAYS THE

19:46.510 --> 19:47.818
TRANSGENDERED COMMUNITY IS

19:47.820 --> 19:48.775
INCREDIBLY PROTECTIVE. THEY'RE

19:48.780 --> 19:49.974
NOT GONNA OPEN UP TO SOMEONE

19:49.980 --> 19:51.242
THEY DON'T KNOW. THEY NEED TO

19:51.250 --> 19:52.012
SEE YOU TO TRUST YOU.

19:52.020 --> 19:52.918
Christian: WILL YOU EXPLAIN TO

19:52.920 --> 19:53.909
ME HOW 2 COMPLETE STRANGERS CAN

19:53.920 --> 19:55.285
BUILD A TRUSTING RELATIONSHIP

19:55.290 --> 19:56.382
IN LESS THAN 5 MINUTES?

19:56.390 --> 19:57.527
Liz: OH, FOR GOD SAKES.

19:57.530 --> 19:58.519
YOU'VE CHARMED HALF OF THE

19:58.530 --> 20:00.395
FEMALE POPULATION OF MIAMI, NOT

20:00.400 --> 20:01.856
TO MENTION A FEW TRANSSEXUALS.

20:01.860 --> 20:03.794
Christian: ONE TRANSSEXUAL. AND

20:03.800 --> 20:04.789
AVA FOOLED EVERYBODY.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.267
Liz: NOT EVERYBODY. I KNEW THERE

20:06.270 --> 20:07.259
WAS A REASON I WASN'T

20:07.270 --> 20:07.929
ATTRACTED TO HER.

20:07.940 --> 20:08.861
Sean: WHAT IF CHARM DOESN'T

20:08.870 --> 20:09.939
WORK? ANY OTHER IDEAS?

20:09.940 --> 20:11.430
Liz: BE EMPATHETIC. CONVINCE

20:11.440 --> 20:12.304
HER THAT YOU'RE THERE

20:12.310 --> 20:13.709
AS PROFESSIONALS TO HELP AVA,

20:13.710 --> 20:14.574
THAT YOU'RE CONCERNED

20:14.580 --> 20:15.308
ABOUT HER WELFARE.

20:15.310 --> 20:15.878
Sean: I'M NOT SURE

20:15.880 --> 20:16.699
I'M THAT GOOD A LIAR.

20:16.710 --> 20:17.699
Christian: I AM. COME ON.

20:17.710 --> 20:18.870
WE'RE LATE.

20:24.620 --> 20:25.939
Salesman: THIS ONE HERE IS A

20:25.950 --> 20:27.679
FILET TOUGH AND BAY WITH A

20:27.690 --> 20:28.884
RUBBER HANDLE. REAL GOOD FOR

20:31.390 --> 20:32.687
CHOICE FOR BARBECUING OR

20:32.690 --> 20:35.955
DRESSING MEATS.

20:35.960 --> 20:38.827
THIS ONE'S MY FAVORITE. A BUCK

20:38.830 --> 20:40.969
NIGHTHAWK. VERY STEALTHY. COMES

20:40.970 --> 20:43.700
WITH A NYLON SHEATH.

20:43.710 --> 20:46.429
IT HAS A 652 STEEL DROP-POINT

20:46.440 --> 20:48.374
BLADE FOR A REAL LONG LIFE...

20:48.380 --> 20:50.234
NO MATTER WHAT THE ELEMENTS.

20:52.850 --> 20:53.839
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS

20:53.850 --> 20:55.841
FOR YOU TODAY?

20:55.850 --> 20:58.444
Adrian: YES. WHICH ONE WOULD

20:58.450 --> 20:59.644
YOU RECOMMEND IF I WANTED

20:59.650 --> 21:01.254
TO GUT SOMETHING?

21:03.560 --> 21:05.050
P.A.: DR. DAVIS, TELEPHONE,

21:05.060 --> 21:07.654
PLEASE. DR. DAVIS, TELEPHONE,

21:07.660 --> 21:08.649
PLEASE.

21:14.670 --> 21:16.069
J.T.: I WENT INTO A MEN'S

21:16.070 --> 21:19.460
REST ROOM YESTERDAY. I'VE NEVER

21:19.470 --> 21:21.631
BEEN SO SCARED.

21:21.640 --> 21:22.629
Carol: YOU'VE BEEN LIVING

21:22.640 --> 21:24.904
AS A MAN NOW FOR 5 YEARS, J.T.

21:24.910 --> 21:26.707
YOU'VE CERTAINLY USED THE MALE

21:26.710 --> 21:28.371
REST ROOM SINCE YOUR SURGERY.

21:28.380 --> 21:31.884
RIGHT? SO WHY THE FEAR?

21:31.890 --> 21:34.814
J.T.: IT WAS A TROUGH URINAL.

21:34.820 --> 21:35.957
Carol: MMM.

21:35.960 --> 21:37.587
J.T.: WHERE ALL THE GUYS PEE

21:37.590 --> 21:40.058
IN THE OPEN. AND WHAT IF THE GUY

21:40.060 --> 21:42.722
NEXT TO ME SEES IT'S A BRAND-NEW

21:42.730 --> 21:44.664
PENIS AND...HE WANTS

21:44.670 --> 21:47.366
TO BEAT ME DOWN?

21:47.370 --> 21:48.632
YOU KNOW?

21:48.640 --> 21:49.766
Carol: SO YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:49.770 --> 21:50.759
YOU JUST NEED TO LEARN HOW

21:50.770 --> 21:52.032
TO PROTECT YOURSELF, J.T.

21:52.040 --> 21:53.029
J.T.: DOES NOTHING MAKE YOU

21:53.040 --> 21:53.904
AFRAID, CAROL?

21:53.910 --> 21:56.936
IS THERE NOTHING YOU FEAR?

22:01.380 --> 22:05.441
Carol: [SIGHS] YEAH.

22:09.920 --> 22:13.924
AIRPORTS.

22:13.930 --> 22:16.626
MAKING IT THROUGH SECURITY

22:16.630 --> 22:20.760
AS A WOMAN.

22:20.770 --> 22:22.988
OH, MAN. SINCE 9/11, IT'S

22:23.000 --> 22:26.037
LIKE...IT'S LIKE THEY SCRUTINIZE

22:26.040 --> 22:29.532
SO CAREFULLY NOW.

22:29.540 --> 22:31.405
I DON'T KNOW. IF YOU CAN MAKE IT

22:31.410 --> 22:33.412
THROUGH THOSE SECURITY LINES

22:33.420 --> 22:36.674
UNDETECTED AND ACCEPTED...IT'S

22:36.680 --> 22:37.988
LIKE YOU'RE REAL.

22:37.990 --> 22:39.412
YOU KNOW?

22:41.820 --> 22:43.151
THIS IS A CLOSED MEETING.

22:43.160 --> 22:44.684
CAN I HELP YOU?

22:44.690 --> 22:45.827
Christian: WE'RE LOOKING FOR

22:45.830 --> 22:47.855
CAROL NELSON IN ROOM 305.

22:47.860 --> 22:48.792
Carol: AND YOU ARE?

22:48.800 --> 22:50.427
Christian: I'M DR. CHRISTIAN

22:50.430 --> 22:51.499
TROY. THIS IS MY PARTNER

22:51.500 --> 22:53.559
SEAN MCNAMARA.

22:53.570 --> 22:54.696
WE'VE BEEN TRYING

22:54.700 --> 22:55.792
TO REACH YOU. SOPHIA LOPEZ

22:55.800 --> 22:57.961
GAVE US YOUR NAME.

22:57.970 --> 23:01.178
Carol: [SNICKERS, SIGHS]

23:01.180 --> 23:02.829
OK, LISTEN, UH, WHY DON'T WE

23:02.840 --> 23:03.841
JUST TAKE A QUICK,

23:03.850 --> 23:04.976
LITTLE BREAK. OK?

23:04.980 --> 23:06.106
GO OUTSIDE, HAVE A LITTLE SNACK.

23:06.110 --> 23:07.646
AND I'LL SEE YOU GUYS BACK

23:07.650 --> 23:08.639
IN 10.

23:12.720 --> 23:13.857
J.T.: THANK YOU, CAROL.

23:17.990 --> 23:19.457
Carol: SO, HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

23:19.460 --> 23:20.620
Sean: WE'RE PLASTIC SURGEONS.

23:20.630 --> 23:21.722
WE'VE FLOWN OUT FROM MIAMI

23:21.730 --> 23:22.594
BECAUSE WE NEED MEDICAL

23:22.600 --> 23:23.692
INFORMATION ON A PATIENT.

23:23.700 --> 23:25.725
Carol: MMM. REALLY. WELL, I

23:25.730 --> 23:27.163
GUESS AS SURGEONS AND FRIENDS OF

23:27.170 --> 23:28.728
SOPHIA'S, YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT

23:28.740 --> 23:30.469
A GENDER REASSIGNMENT FILE IS

23:30.470 --> 23:32.802
AS CLASSIFIED AS A NUCLEAR

23:32.810 --> 23:33.902
WEAPONS PROGRAM.

23:33.910 --> 23:35.229
Sean: WE ARE AWARE OF THAT, MS.

23:35.240 --> 23:36.878
NELSON, AND WE'RE COMPLETELY

23:36.880 --> 23:38.745
SYM PATH ETIC.

23:38.750 --> 23:39.739
Carol: OK, SO, WHO'S

23:39.750 --> 23:40.774
THE PATIENT?

23:40.780 --> 23:41.678
Sean: THE NAME SHE GOES BY NOW

23:41.680 --> 23:43.545
IS AVA MOORE.

23:53.630 --> 23:55.029
Christian: MY PARTNER SEAN WAS

23:55.030 --> 23:56.622
THE SURGEON WHO PERFORMED

23:56.630 --> 23:58.769
SOPHIA'S BOTTOM SURGERY. HE ALSO

23:58.770 --> 23:59.896
SAVED HER FROM A BOTCHED

23:59.900 --> 24:01.094
TRACH EAL SHAVE.

24:01.100 --> 24:02.237
Carol: [SIGHS] WELL, THAT'S

24:02.240 --> 24:04.765
TOUCHING. BUT IT DOESN'T CHANGE

24:04.770 --> 24:06.499
A THING, GENTLEMEN. YOU SEE,

24:06.510 --> 24:07.636
THESE PEOPLE HERE, THEY'RE

24:07.640 --> 24:10.871
FRAGILE. SO WHY IS IT THAT I

24:10.880 --> 24:14.839
SHOULD BETRAY THEIR CONFIDENCE?

24:14.850 --> 24:16.772
IF AVA MOORE WANTS HER RECORDS,

24:16.780 --> 24:19.647
WHY HASN'T SHE CONTACTED US?

24:19.650 --> 24:21.288
Sean: BECAUSE AVA IS AFRAID.

24:21.290 --> 24:23.178
17 YEARS AGO, WHEN SHE HAD HER

24:23.190 --> 24:25.078
SURGERY, THERE WAS NO COMMUNITY.

24:31.800 --> 24:33.734
Christian: SHE NEEDS HELP. SHE'S

24:33.740 --> 24:34.559
HAD A WEAKENING OF THE

24:34.570 --> 24:36.060
RECONSTRUCT ED VAGINAL WALL, AND

24:36.070 --> 24:39.107
THE BLADDER IS COMING THROUGH.

24:39.110 --> 24:41.670
FOR US TO REPAIR IT, WE NEED TO

24:41.680 --> 24:42.931
SEE HER RECORDS BECAUSE SHE

24:42.940 --> 24:44.168
CLAIMS THAT SHE HAD AN ADVERSE

24:44.180 --> 24:45.909
REACTION TO THE ANESTHESIA

24:45.910 --> 24:47.639
IN HER ORIGINAL SURGERY.

24:47.650 --> 24:49.072
WE'RE HERE TO HELP AVA,

24:49.080 --> 24:51.640
MS. NELSON. WE'RE NOT INTO

24:51.650 --> 24:53.186
TAKING RISKS WITH HER LIFE.

24:56.960 --> 24:58.325
Carol: [SIGHS] WELL, YOU DON'T

24:58.330 --> 25:00.821
WANT TO TALK TO ME. YOU WANT TO

25:00.830 --> 25:02.923
TALK TO HER SURGEON. HE'S

25:02.930 --> 25:03.999
RETIRED, AND HE'S TAKEN

25:04.000 --> 25:05.820
HER RECORDS WITH HIM.

25:05.830 --> 25:07.730
Christian: WHERE IS HE?

25:30.590 --> 25:31.921
Sean: DR. BARETT MOORE?

25:33.330 --> 25:34.251
Barett: I'VE BEEN EXPECTING

25:34.260 --> 25:36.057
YOU, DOCTORS.

25:40.870 --> 25:42.929
I UNDERSTAND YOU'VE MET MY WIFE.

25:52.750 --> 25:53.944
Ba rett: POLLINATOR?

26:01.890 --> 26:05.257
HYBRIDS. THE FIRST ORCHID

26:05.260 --> 26:07.649
HYBRIDS WERE PRODUCED IN 1858,

26:07.660 --> 26:09.025
AND SINCE THEN, THE PROCESS HAS

26:09.030 --> 26:10.156
ACCELERATED. BUT BECAUSE OF

26:10.160 --> 26:13.220
THEIR. . .ARTIFICIAL AND UNNATU RAL

26:13.230 --> 26:15.198
EVOLUTION, THEY'RE UNABLE TO

26:15.200 --> 26:16.963
ATTRACT A SUITABLE POLLINATOR,

26:16.970 --> 26:20.030
AND HAND POLLINIZATION IS SO

26:20.040 --> 26:25.046
UNRELIABLE AND TIME-CONSUMING.

26:25.050 --> 26:26.642
THERE ARE MYSTERIES TO BE

26:26.650 --> 26:28.311
SOLVED.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.117
Sean: YOU RETIRED FROM MEDICINE

26:30.120 --> 26:31.747
TO BECOME A BOTANIST?

26:31.750 --> 26:32.648
Barett: I'VE RETIRED FROM

26:32.650 --> 26:33.958
MEDICINE BECAUSE MY WORK WAS

26:33.960 --> 26:37.350
DONE. EVERY ORCHID HERE HAS BEEN

26:37.360 --> 26:39.885
ALTERED, EACH ONE EVOLVING RIGHT

26:39.890 --> 26:41.426
BEFORE OUR EYES INTO NEW

26:41.430 --> 26:44.069
SPECIES, CHANGING THEIR VERY

26:44.070 --> 26:46.789
IDENTITIES.

26:46.800 --> 26:47.892
Christian: YOU MASTERED THE

26:47.900 --> 26:50.334
TECHNIQUE ON HUMANS. WHY HAVE

26:50.340 --> 26:53.207
YOU TURNED TO FLOWERS?

26:53.210 --> 26:54.029
Barett: BECAUSE THEY NEVER

26:54.040 --> 26:56.372
LEAVE. AND THEY RARELY

26:56.380 --> 27:00.146
DISAPPOINT. HUMANS AND MEDICINE

27:00.150 --> 27:03.916
ARE SO. . .FALLIBLE.

27:03.920 --> 27:05.945
Sean: THERE WAS NOTHING FALLIBLE

27:05.950 --> 27:07.315
IN THE TRANSFORMATION

27:07.320 --> 27:09.311
OF AVA MOORE. SHE'S THE WORK OF

27:09.320 --> 27:10.685
A MEDICAL GENIUS AT THE PEAK

27:10.690 --> 27:12.226
OF HIS CAREER.

27:12.230 --> 27:13.254
Christian: WHY STOP AT THE

27:13.260 --> 27:15.626
HEIGHT OF YOUR SUCCESS?

27:21.840 --> 27:23.728
Barett: AVERY TANNER IS

27:23.740 --> 27:25.833
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SUCCESS

27:25.840 --> 27:26.909
THAT I HAD.

27:30.240 --> 27:32.708
HE WAS A WALKER, WHICH IS TO SAY

27:32.710 --> 27:34.109
THAT HE WAS AN ESCORT TO SOME OF

27:34.120 --> 27:36.475
THE WEALTHIEST SOCIETY WOMEN

27:36.480 --> 27:37.981
LOOKING FOR PHILANTHROPIC

27:37.990 --> 27:40.447
CAUSES. HE WAS A VERY GOOD

27:40.450 --> 27:43.055
LOOKING YOUNG MAN, AND UNUSUALLY

27:43.060 --> 27:44.857
INTERESTED IN THE UNORTHODOX

27:44.860 --> 27:46.725
WORK OF AN INEXPERIENCED NEW

27:46.730 --> 27:49.426
DOCTOR. HE WOULD BRING THEM TO

27:49.430 --> 27:52.922
MY FUND-RAISERS AND CHARM THEM

27:52.930 --> 27:55.330
INTO GIVING LARGE DONATIONS FOR

27:55.340 --> 27:56.989
A FIELD OF MEDICINE THAT THEY

27:57.000 --> 27:59.764
BARELY UNDERSTOOD. AT FIRST,

27:59.770 --> 28:01.328
I THOUGHT AS A GAY MAN HE WAS

28:01.340 --> 28:03.479
DRAWN TO THE TRANSGENDER WORLD

28:03.480 --> 28:05.505
BECAUSE OF THE POSSIBILITIES,

28:05.510 --> 28:08.775
UH, FOR HIMSELF. BUT, UM...

28:08.780 --> 28:16.414
HE WASN'T. HE WAS DRAWN TO ME.

28:16.420 --> 28:18.820
WE BECAME CLOSE, BUT I COULDN'T

28:18.830 --> 28:21.298
BE WITH HIM THE WAY THAT HE

28:21.300 --> 28:23.154
WANTED ME TO.

28:23.160 --> 28:25.128
THAT'S NOT MY NATURE.

28:27.840 --> 28:30.536
ONE NIGHT AVERY CAME TO ME

28:30.540 --> 28:35.807
IN DESPAIR...SUICIDAL...

28:35.810 --> 28:37.175
AND HE ASKED IF I WERE TO

28:37.180 --> 28:38.841
CHANGE HIM INTO A WOMAN,

28:38.850 --> 28:42.172
COULD I LOVE HIM THEN, AND

28:42.180 --> 28:45.445
I BELIEVED THAT I COULD.

28:45.450 --> 28:50.456
THE RESULTING OPERATION WAS

28:50.460 --> 28:53.918
PERFECT. THANK YOU, HARRY,

28:53.930 --> 28:56.854
YOU MAY GO. TO AN OUTSIDER,

28:56.860 --> 28:58.464
WE WERE LIKE ANY OTHER HAPPILY

28:58.470 --> 29:00.062
MARRIED COUPLE, BUT ON THE

29:00.070 --> 29:04.302
INSIDE, SEXUALLY, I...

29:04.310 --> 29:07.404
I COULD NOT FORGET.

29:15.820 --> 29:17.981
SHE THOUGHT THAT A CHILD MIGHT

29:17.990 --> 29:19.878
NORMALIZE WHAT WASN'T, SO WE

29:19.890 --> 29:21.517
AGREED THAT MY ASSISTANT WOULD

29:21.520 --> 29:23.249
BE IMPREGNATED WITH MY SPERM AND

29:23.260 --> 29:25.581
CARRY THE BABY TO TERM FOR US.

29:25.590 --> 29:27.478
AI-TER ADRIAN WAS BORN, THINGS

29:27.490 --> 29:29.993
SEEMED TO BE MORE COMFORTABLE,

29:30.000 --> 29:31.160
BUT SOON Ai-TER THEY

29:31.170 --> 29:34.958
DETERIORATED. I COULDN'T GIVE

29:34.970 --> 29:37.029
HER WHAT SHE WANTED. IT WASN'T

29:37.040 --> 29:41.500
HER FAULT. I WAS THE FAILURE.

29:41.510 --> 29:47.244
I COULDN'T SEE...HER.

29:47.250 --> 29:52.040
I COULD ONLY SEE MY OWN WORK.

29:52.050 --> 29:54.985
Sean: AND SO SHE LEI-T?

29:54.990 --> 29:56.878
Barett: I CAME HOME ONE DAY FROM

29:56.890 --> 29:59.324
A CONFERENCE AND THEY WERE GONE.

41:09.760 --> 41:13.867
LOOK, YOU'RE STRESSED AND YOU'RE

41:13.870 --> 41:17.567

41:44.000 --> 41:45.968

41:45.970 --> 41:46.959
Ava: THIS JUST DOESN'T WORK FOR

41:56.880 --> 41:59.747

42:23.770 --> 42:27.638
Ava: NO. NO, YOU NEED TO BE

42:27.640 --> 42:30.177
STRONG, MATT. WE HAD A FLING,

42:30.180 --> 42:33.104
AND IT WAS CHARMING. WE DON'T

42:33.110 --> 42:34.771
HAVE THE COMPONENTS TO BUILD

42:34.780 --> 42:36.771
FROM THAT, TO CREATE

42:36.780 --> 42:38.042
A RELATIONSHIP OUT OF MERE

42:38.050 --> 42:43.317

42:43.320 --> 42:47.928
INEVITABLE. THE NATURAL ORDER.

Matt: NO. EVERYTHING'S IN HERE.

43:07.680 --> 43:12.083
Ava: GOOD. BE A GOOD BOY, TURN

43:12.090 --> 43:15.651
AROUND, AND WALK OUT THE DOOR.

43:15.660 --> 43:17.082

43:47.790 --> 43:49.280
Joan: THIS IS COMPLETELY

UNNECESSARY. YOU DON'T HAVE TO

44:03.740 --> 44:05.867
WE'D START BY INSERTING A

44:05.870 --> 44:07.735

44:07.740 --> 44:09.276

44:09.280 --> 44:10.872
THE SKIN HAS BEEN TIGHTENED,

44:10.880 --> 44:11.778
ALLOWING IT TO STRETCH AND

44:11.780 --> 44:14.715
ASSUME A MORE NATURAL HANG.

44:14.720 --> 44:16.312
WE'D ALSO DO A FLAP SURGERY,

44:16.320 --> 44:18.788

44:18.790 --> 44:20.280
MUSCLE FROM YOUR BACK AND TUNNEL

44:20.290 --> 44:21.416
IT TO THE FRONT SO YOUR BREASTS

44:21.420 --> 44:22.284
COULD REGAIN THEIR

44:22.290 --> 44:24.383
AGE-APPROPRIATE FULLNESS

44:24.390 --> 44:25.322
AND SLOPE.

44:25.330 --> 44:26.319

44:35.770 --> 44:37.761

Joan: YEAH, VERY FUNNY.

44:57.920 --> 44:59.023
HA, HA, HA. WHO IS THAT?

44:59.030 --> 45:01.180
Sean: THESE COMPUTER GENERATED

45:01.190 --> 45:03.294

45:03.300 --> 45:05.996
OF THE NATURAL AGING PROCESS.

Christian: IT IS WHAT YOU

45:18.810 --> 45:19.947
ASKED FOR.

45:19.950 --> 45:21.474
Joan: NO, NO, IT IS NOT WHAT I

45:21.480 --> 45:22.777
ASKED FOR. I ASKED FOR SOMEONE

45:22.780 --> 45:23.542

45:23.550 --> 45:26.087
FOR COOPER, NOT SOME PIECE OF

Sean: WE THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO

52:15.760 --> 52:19.218
AND THAT'S ALL

52:19.230 --> 52:22.893
I KNOW,

52:22.900 --> 52:29.237
THAT'S ALL I KNOW,

52:29.240 --> 52:35.418
THAT'S ALL I KNOW,

52:35.420 --> 52:41.643
OH, OH,

52:41.650 --> 52:47.486
OH, OH,

52:47.490 --> 52:49.390
OH*

52:49.400 --> 52:54.827
Guard: EXCUSE ME, MA'AM?

52:54.830 --> 52:55.933
COULD YOU TAKE OFF YOUR

52:55.940 --> 52:58.465
SUNGLASSES, PLEASE?

53:02.940 --> 53:06.205
CAN I SEE YOUR PASSPORT, PLEASE?

53:22.830 --> 53:24.957
THANK YOU, MISS MOORE.

53:30.570 --> 53:33.437
>> * WHEN THE SINGER'S GONE,

53:33.440 --> 53:37.433
LET THE SONG GO ON,

53:37.440 --> 53:39.704
IT'S A FINE LINE

53:39.710 --> 53:41.302
BETWEEN THE DARKNESS

53:41.310 --> 53:42.709
AND THE DAWN,

53:42.720 --> 53:46.315
THEY SAY IN THE DARKEST NIGHT,

53:46.320 --> 53:49.312
THERE'S A LIGHT BEYOND,

53:49.320 --> 53:52.323
BUT THE ENDING ALWAYS

53:52.330 --> 53:55.857
COMES AT LAST,

53:55.860 --> 54:00.866
ENDINGS ALWAYS COME TOO FAST,

54:00.870 --> 54:03.737
THEY COME TOO FAST,

54:03.740 --> 54:07.460
BUT THEY PASS TOO SLOW,

54:07.470 --> 54:09.677
I LOVE YOU,

54:09.680 --> 54:12.877
AND THAT'S ALL

54:12.880 --> 54:16.475
I KNOW,

54:16.480 --> 54:23.010
THAT'S ALL I KNOW,

54:23.020 --> 54:29.459
THAT'S ALL I KNOW,

54:29.460 --> 54:35.695
OH, OH, OH,

54:35.700 --> 54:40.831
OH, OH,

54:40.840 --> 54:43.570
OH*
