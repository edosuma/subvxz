WEBVTT

00:26.968 --> 00:28.302
I'll put it up front for you.

00:28.302 --> 00:29.887
Everybody back.

00:30.888 --> 00:34.725
The girls have arrived.
And looking fine.

00:37.562 --> 00:38.896
I owe you one, Danny.

00:40.982 --> 00:43.693
Deejay Scorpious
here, y'all.

00:43.693 --> 00:46.112
Liquid mixing till the
sun goes tall.

01:00.376 --> 01:02.253
Hey, I got to get back to
the bachelorette party.

01:02.253 --> 01:05.089
What about you and me?
What are you talking about?

01:05.089 --> 01:06.632
When we get the bride-to-be
sufficiently wasted,

01:06.632 --> 01:08.092
I'm going to come
back for you.

01:08.301 --> 01:09.927
You promise?
I promise.

01:11.387 --> 01:14.223
G's up, ho's down.

01:14.223 --> 01:17.435
You ain't quakin' and shakin' the
bacon, then you ain't even playin'.

01:26.527 --> 01:29.405
Yo, y'all, let's kick it trance
style with a new test press...

01:29.405 --> 01:33.242
from my boys from my-mo,
d-day bomb squad.

01:55.848 --> 01:57.475
This place doesn't
have sprinklers.

01:57.475 --> 01:59.977
I know. Hit the alarm.
You, hit the alarm!

02:02.271 --> 02:03.773
Let's go.
Everybody out!

02:04.524 --> 02:06.484
Everybody stay calm!

02:06.484 --> 02:07.944
There's an exit over here.

02:10.571 --> 02:12.448
This is Eric Delko, CSI.

02:12.448 --> 02:14.742
There's a major structure
fire at Club Descent.

02:14.742 --> 02:16.828
Northwest 7th and Main.

02:22.208 --> 02:23.292
Open the door!

02:24.043 --> 02:27.380
It's locked.
It's chained! Move!

02:30.425 --> 02:33.052
Connie?!
Connie!

02:37.265 --> 02:39.267
Hey! Have you got
any more of those?

02:39.267 --> 02:41.185
No. I don't think it's
going to be enough!

02:41.185 --> 02:42.770
Get the hell out
of here!

02:45.273 --> 02:48.109
Connie? Connie?!
Connie, don't go that way!

02:48.109 --> 02:50.695
No! No! Follow me!
The front door is packed!

02:51.237 --> 02:53.948
It's bottlenecked up there.
There's just too many people.

03:02.165 --> 03:05.251
Delko, that door
over there is open!

03:05.251 --> 03:06.335
No way!

03:06.335 --> 03:07.503
Come on over here!

03:08.838 --> 03:11.257
Connie!
Connie!

03:19.891 --> 03:21.726
Oh, my god.
Mandy, she's still inside!

03:21.726 --> 03:23.102
I'm going back in.

03:27.064 --> 03:28.441
Everybody stop!

03:28.441 --> 03:29.942
There's an open
door over here!

03:29.942 --> 03:30.985
Come this way!

03:45.083 --> 03:47.418
Are you okay?!
Eric, where's Speed?

03:47.960 --> 03:48.961
He's around back!
He's helping people out!

03:48.961 --> 03:50.880
All right.
Fire Rescue's on the way!

03:53.674 --> 03:55.218
Take my hand!
Come on.

03:55.718 --> 03:57.386
Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

04:06.771 --> 04:07.939
Connie, wake up.

04:07.939 --> 04:09.023
Come on, man,

04:09.023 --> 04:10.483
we got to get these
people out of here!

04:12.652 --> 04:13.694
Come on!

04:14.821 --> 04:16.406
Everybody get away
from the building!

04:16.406 --> 04:18.156
Get away from
the building!

04:18.156 --> 04:19.826
It's about to collapse!

04:19.826 --> 04:21.911
The building is about
to collapse! Let's go!

04:27.166 --> 04:28.584
Keep breathing.

04:28.584 --> 04:30.461
Deep breaths, ma'am,
deep breaths.

04:30.461 --> 04:31.504
Get a blanket on her.

04:32.213 --> 04:33.673
Get a blanket.

04:35.758 --> 04:37.427
Hold these people back!

04:47.437 --> 04:49.522
It went down so fast.
I didn't see a thing.

04:49.522 --> 04:51.399
We'll figure it out, Speed.

04:51.399 --> 04:53.067
We will find out
what happened,

04:53.067 --> 04:56.320
and this building
will be our witness.

05:31.939 --> 05:35.068
1x22 Tinder Box

05:47.912 --> 05:51.249
Engine 32, get the area around
the north side of the complex.

05:55.420 --> 05:56.754
Make sure any evidence...

05:56.754 --> 05:59.382
that's tied to a particular
body stays with that body.

05:59.382 --> 06:01.968
P.D. needs a list of the
victims and the missing.

06:02.385 --> 06:04.846
Eric, I can't feel anything.

06:05.263 --> 06:06.889
That's good, right?

06:07.849 --> 06:09.684
I-it's okay, Connie.
You're going to be all right.

06:09.684 --> 06:11.269
Just hang
in there, okay?

06:22.196 --> 06:23.323
How is she?

06:25.909 --> 06:27.702
I don't think she's
going to make it.

06:32.415 --> 06:33.249
Come on.

06:33.249 --> 06:35.668
The DJ's deck was
here, and, uh ...

06:36.711 --> 06:38.379
that's the remains
of the dance floor.

06:38.379 --> 06:39.505
Ceiling went up in minutes.

06:39.505 --> 06:40.924
Any sign of accelerant?

06:40.924 --> 06:42.342
Canines haven't alerted.

06:42.342 --> 06:43.551
Nothing.

06:43.551 --> 06:45.511
That's what I was talking
about over there.

06:45.511 --> 06:46.679
Chained door.

06:47.305 --> 06:49.724
So, if we have two
chained exit doors,

06:49.724 --> 06:50.683
did we miss anything?

06:50.683 --> 06:52.685
You know me better
than that, Horatio.

06:53.728 --> 06:56.064
Permit was filed five months
ago when it opened.

06:56.064 --> 06:58.441
Exits were free
and clear.

06:58.733 --> 07:00.276
There was a
compliance issue.

07:00.276 --> 07:01.861
A compliance?

07:01.861 --> 07:02.654
A month back--

07:02.654 --> 07:04.030
soundproofing.

07:04.530 --> 07:05.615
Soundproofing.

07:05.615 --> 07:07.784
Okay, Speed, we need to take
a look at that soundproofing.

07:07.784 --> 07:08.826
Where's the owner?

07:08.826 --> 07:10.828
He's outside
with Bernstein.

07:10.828 --> 07:11.955
Quentin Haid.

07:15.917 --> 07:17.126
I'll call you right back.

07:18.920 --> 07:20.338
DJ Scorpius,

07:20.964 --> 07:23.216
there's a lot of people
wanting to talk to you.

07:23.216 --> 07:25.009
Yeah, well,
I'm right here.

07:25.009 --> 07:26.427
You want to tell me
what happened?

07:26.427 --> 07:27.804
You want to tell me
why you frontin' on ??

07:27.804 --> 07:28.721
I'm not frontin' you,
all right?

07:28.721 --> 07:30.932
I'm with Miami P.D.
The crime lab.

07:30.932 --> 07:32.308
You look like you
got out pretty quick.

07:32.308 --> 07:33.601
There's not a speck
of soot on you.

07:33.601 --> 07:35.603
Yeah, well, I saw the flames,
and I bounced, Dawg.

07:35.603 --> 07:36.437
I bounced.

07:36.437 --> 07:37.355
Yeah, well,

07:37.355 --> 07:38.481
who gave you permission
to use the pyrotechnics?

07:38.481 --> 07:40.483
I use them
every weekend.

07:40.483 --> 07:41.734
Man, they're just
like sparklers.

07:41.734 --> 07:44.195
Just like Fourth of July.
Nothing ever goes wrong.

07:44.195 --> 07:45.613
All it takes is one.

07:47.699 --> 07:49.659
Excuse me,
are you the owner?

07:49.659 --> 07:50.660
Yeah, that's me.

07:50.660 --> 07:52.537
You ever hear of
a sprinkler system?

07:52.537 --> 07:53.329
Didn't need them.

07:53.329 --> 07:55.123
The club was
grandfathered in...

07:55.123 --> 07:56.499
built pre-code.

07:56.499 --> 07:58.459
Yeah, I bet you those
chained exit doors ...

07:58.459 --> 08:00.253
were grandfathered
in, too, huh?

08:00.253 --> 08:01.045
What'd you
expect me to do?

08:01.045 --> 08:02.422
People were
sneaking in.

08:02.422 --> 08:03.506
And dying to get out.

08:03.506 --> 08:05.425
Fifteen dead;
fifty-eight in the hospital.

08:05.425 --> 08:06.759
Were you trying to
get out of your lease?

08:06.759 --> 08:07.927
What are you implying?

08:07.927 --> 08:08.928
I'm not implying anything.

08:08.928 --> 08:11.097
The average life span
of a club is six months,

08:11.097 --> 08:13.099
and you were due,
my friend.

08:13.099 --> 08:15.268
Now, do you have
an office we can talk in?

08:15.977 --> 08:17.770
Inside.
Show me.

08:21.399 --> 08:24.819
You have a flash burn
on your face, Mr. Haid,

08:24.819 --> 08:26.779
which indicates you've been
in the presence of ...

08:26.779 --> 08:28.907
an accelerant.

08:28.907 --> 08:30.491
Are you a base-head?

08:39.458 --> 08:41.961
I had an accident a
couple days ago.

08:45.131 --> 08:46.424
Where's your coke?

08:46.841 --> 08:47.884
I got rid of it.

08:47.884 --> 08:49.886
It's a bad...
bad habit.

08:49.886 --> 08:53.264
Ah, yes, and stupid.
Did it start the fire?

08:53.264 --> 08:54.474
Why would I torch
my own club?

08:54.474 --> 08:56.184
This is my life.

08:56.184 --> 08:58.269
I got all my
money here.

09:03.358 --> 09:04.150
I don't believe it.

09:04.150 --> 09:05.902
Somebody took
my money!

09:08.404 --> 09:10.198
It's just not
your day, is it?

09:10.198 --> 09:11.824
I had $15,000.

09:11.824 --> 09:13.493
Who else had
the combination?

09:13.493 --> 09:15.870
Just one of my bartenders,
Johnny Brosnan.

09:15.870 --> 09:18.081
Who happens
to be missing, right?

09:18.498 --> 09:20.792
If you were robbed,
that safe is evidence.

09:22.460 --> 09:23.461
Hang on.

09:23.461 --> 09:25.672
Yeah?
What's up?

09:26.089 --> 09:28.633
I'm, uh, I'm all right.
I'm here.

09:29.467 --> 09:30.718
You need
to take the day?

09:30.718 --> 09:31.970
Oh, no. I need ...

09:31.970 --> 09:33.179
I need to work.
I need to be here.

09:33.179 --> 09:35.974
Okay. I need that safe printed.
Okay.

09:35.974 --> 09:38.518
Let's have Bernstein do some
background work on the employees.

09:38.518 --> 09:40.687
Theft and fire.
Start with the owner.

09:40.687 --> 09:41.854
Okay.
Good.

09:41.854 --> 09:43.022
Hang in there.

09:44.899 --> 09:45.900
Horatio.

09:45.900 --> 09:47.735
I got a D.B.,
needs your attention.

09:47.735 --> 09:48.987
Yeah, listen,

09:48.987 --> 09:50.613
I'm in the middle
of something here.

09:50.613 --> 09:53.241
Well, I've got orders
to grab you, pull you off.

09:53.241 --> 09:54.993
Red ball, high-profile.

09:54.993 --> 09:56.286
You've been, uh ...

09:56.619 --> 09:57.579
requested.

09:57.579 --> 09:59.497
Political or judicial?

09:59.497 --> 10:00.456
Both.

10:01.082 --> 10:01.958
Okay.

10:04.877 --> 10:06.170
Your honor,

10:06.170 --> 10:07.630
why don't you
tell me what happened.

10:08.214 --> 10:09.465
The woman in
the bathroom.

10:11.175 --> 10:14.762
Her name's Jill Susan.
She's a prostitute.

10:15.805 --> 10:17.348
Is your wife out of town?

10:19.142 --> 10:21.227
My wife died last year.

10:21.227 --> 10:22.770
I'm sorry to hear that.

10:22.770 --> 10:24.939
I don't have time
to wine and dine women.

10:25.356 --> 10:27.650
Jill comes once
a week, same time.

10:27.650 --> 10:29.068
Spends the night.

10:29.903 --> 10:32.405
She got here right
before 11:30.

10:32.405 --> 10:35.325
Usually by taxi, but
tonight she drove herself.

10:36.034 --> 10:37.285
Car's in the driveway.

10:37.285 --> 10:38.244
It's a BMW.

10:38.244 --> 10:39.203
I'll run the registration.

10:39.203 --> 10:40.330
Okay.

10:44.292 --> 10:46.419
She seemed a
little disoriented.

10:46.419 --> 10:48.046
Agitated.

10:48.046 --> 10:50.632
She asked if she
could grab a shower.

10:50.632 --> 10:52.967
A few minutes later,
I heard a loud noise.

10:53.384 --> 10:55.762
I ran in.
She'd fallen.

10:55.762 --> 10:59.098
I turned off the water,
called you guys.

11:03.144 --> 11:04.479
Can you help me?

11:05.021 --> 11:07.148
You know how
this looks.

11:07.148 --> 11:08.483
I do.

11:08.483 --> 11:12.362
Let's see if Jill's body
confirms your story.

11:15.907 --> 11:17.742
They got you, too, huh?

11:18.993 --> 11:20.286
Busy night.

11:20.286 --> 11:22.956
No semen,
no defense wounds.

11:22.956 --> 11:24.666
She does have
what appears ...

11:24.666 --> 11:26.417
to be a fracture of
the frontal skull.

11:29.796 --> 11:32.215
A lot of blood over
here on this faucet.

11:33.383 --> 11:35.468
And that looks like
bloody mucus.

11:40.139 --> 11:41.391
Check this out.

11:47.480 --> 11:49.023
Looks like soot.

11:49.566 --> 11:51.401
You get this from
smoke inhalation.

11:52.986 --> 11:54.904
And I think I know
where it came from.

11:56.489 --> 11:58.366
It's on her clothes, too.

12:00.451 --> 12:01.744
Club Descent.

12:04.789 --> 12:06.457
This lady was at the club.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.794
Smoke inhalation's like
a time-release bomb.

12:09.794 --> 12:11.963
You walk away and
think you're okay.

12:18.553 --> 12:20.013
Soon, you're not
walking at all.

12:28.021 --> 12:30.148
So, our body count is
up to sixteen.

12:31.190 --> 12:33.943
Registered owner of the
BMW is Quentin Haid.

12:33.943 --> 12:35.653
Let's impound that.

12:36.070 --> 12:39.198
All roads lead back to this
club owner, don't they?

12:54.404 --> 12:55.780
It's weird, Alexx.

12:56.823 --> 12:58.450
I barely even knew
her, you know,

12:58.450 --> 13:00.702
but I feel like I had
to pay my respects.

13:00.702 --> 13:02.871
Don't apologize
to anyone, honey ...

13:03.913 --> 13:05.790
especially me.

13:06.833 --> 13:08.126
What was the
cause of death?

13:08.752 --> 13:10.003
You sure you ... ?

13:15.091 --> 13:17.552
A combination of
injuries led to her death.

13:17.552 --> 13:18.845
People don't realize....

13:18.845 --> 13:20.764
there are so many ways
you can die in a fire,

13:20.764 --> 13:22.432
not always from flames.

13:23.183 --> 13:24.768
Carbon monoxide poisoning?

13:24.768 --> 13:27.145
No. She breathed
in superheated air.

13:32.359 --> 13:34.361
A spasm of the epiglottis.

13:34.778 --> 13:36.363
Scorched her airways.

13:37.906 --> 13:40.116
She was a strong girl, Eric.

13:40.533 --> 13:42.243
Made it to the
front door.

13:43.286 --> 13:45.413
But human nature
got the best of her.

13:45.705 --> 13:47.123
Fight or flight?

13:47.666 --> 13:49.751
These people did both
at the same time.

13:57.300 --> 13:58.343
Trampled her.

13:59.177 --> 14:02.389
She's got three fractured
ribs, ruptured spleen.

14:02.681 --> 14:05.976
You didn't even see it
coming, did you, Sugar?

14:07.644 --> 14:09.354
I never even got
her last name.

14:09.771 --> 14:12.774
She was one of the few whose
looks were preserved enough...

14:12.774 --> 14:14.943
to match face
to her I.D.

14:15.777 --> 14:16.820
Wilkes.

14:18.154 --> 14:19.948
Connie Wilkes.

14:29.165 --> 14:30.500
Thanks, Alexx.

14:38.800 --> 14:41.219
Jill Susan was a
cocktail waitress.

14:41.219 --> 14:42.178
Yeah, we know.

14:42.178 --> 14:43.346
We checked out
her pay stubs.

14:43.346 --> 14:45.432
Four thou a week
for three nights work?

14:45.432 --> 14:46.474
You know what
we call that?

14:46.474 --> 14:48.435
Yeah, a very good waitress.

14:48.435 --> 14:49.686
A prostitute.

14:50.520 --> 14:52.564
We got ahold of
your employee list.

14:53.064 --> 14:55.942
two bartenders ...
one bouncer ...

14:55.942 --> 14:58.445
thirty-three
cocktail waitresses?!

14:58.862 --> 15:00.447
You were running girls out
of your club, weren't you?

15:00.447 --> 15:01.323
Nope.

15:01.323 --> 15:02.824
Yup.

15:02.824 --> 15:03.950
Oh, yes, you were.

15:03.950 --> 15:05.952
You were running girls,
and in fact,

15:05.952 --> 15:08.288
even after this girl
survived the fire,

15:08.288 --> 15:10.540
you had her go and
turn a trick.

15:11.583 --> 15:13.001
That's who you are.

15:13.835 --> 15:14.961
I didn't force her.

15:14.961 --> 15:17.088
No, but you did
lend her your car.

15:17.088 --> 15:19.633
I let her borrow it,
but now I want it back.

15:19.633 --> 15:21.176
When can I get it?
It's been impounded.

15:21.176 --> 15:23.637
You know, the thing I find
amazing about you,

15:23.637 --> 15:27.015
is that you have not inquired
about her memorial service,

15:27.015 --> 15:30.602
and yet you want to know
where your car is.

15:30.935 --> 15:32.562
That's pretty salt
of the earth.

15:34.356 --> 15:36.691
You know what?
You can go.

15:38.652 --> 15:39.694
Go.

15:46.326 --> 15:47.327
He can go?

15:47.327 --> 15:48.578
Yeah, let's let him go.

15:48.578 --> 15:52.957
Call the impound lot and tell them
not to let him on the premises ...

15:52.957 --> 15:54.668
for twenty-four hours.

15:54.959 --> 15:56.670
The old squeeze play, huh?

15:56.670 --> 15:57.754
Yeah.

15:58.588 --> 16:00.590
Hey, Danny,
you got my message?

16:00.590 --> 16:03.176
Yeah.
You all right, bro?

16:03.176 --> 16:05.011
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm all right. You?

16:05.011 --> 16:07.722
Yeah, I'm all right.
So, you got to ...

16:07.722 --> 16:08.807
you got to print me?

16:09.349 --> 16:11.226
Money was stolen from
your boss's safe,

16:11.226 --> 16:13.353
so it's just, uh,
standard procedure.

16:13.353 --> 16:14.604
It's not a problem.

16:14.604 --> 16:16.815
You're near the hospital.
I was heading there anyway.

16:16.815 --> 16:19.109
I heard about that blood
drive, man, for the victims.

16:19.109 --> 16:20.110
Yeah.

16:20.860 --> 16:22.946
Danny, uh, you're
The Bouncer over there.

16:22.946 --> 16:24.030
Let me ask you.

16:24.572 --> 16:27.075
Did you know about
the chained exit doors?

16:27.617 --> 16:28.743
Look ...

16:29.369 --> 16:33.039
I didn't like Quentin,
but he did hire me, so ...

16:33.373 --> 16:34.874
Look, he already
admitted to my boss...

16:34.874 --> 16:37.502
that he chained the doors
to keep out sneak-ins.

16:38.545 --> 16:40.463
Yeah, I probably should
have said something,

16:41.006 --> 16:44.676
but he always told me he hired
me for my size, not my opinion.

16:44.676 --> 16:46.886
Well, what is your opinion?

16:48.972 --> 16:50.765
Quentin didn't care
about the club.

16:51.474 --> 16:53.351
Just the women
and the money.

16:53.351 --> 16:55.478
You know, sometimes when
he wasn't around,

16:55.478 --> 16:56.730
I'd dump the place.

16:56.730 --> 16:58.189
Dump it?
Yeah ...

16:58.189 --> 17:00.150
to keep it under max
occupancy.

17:00.442 --> 17:01.609
Make everyone go out,

17:01.609 --> 17:03.194
then recount them when
they come back in.

17:03.194 --> 17:04.320
All right, man.

17:04.320 --> 17:06.406
We're, uh...
we're all done.

17:06.406 --> 17:07.656
I'll see you around.

17:07.656 --> 17:08.992
Take care.
You, too.

17:14.204 --> 17:15.874
Is the fire talking yet?

17:17.250 --> 17:18.501
A little.

17:20.587 --> 17:23.589
We can't reconstruct anything
until the floor is clean.

17:24.424 --> 17:27.135
There is a direct heat
source from the stage...

17:27.135 --> 17:28.386
to the ceiling overhang.

17:28.386 --> 17:29.804
The pattern indicates ...

17:29.804 --> 17:32.515
that it was from the sparklers
from the pyrotechnics.

17:33.224 --> 17:36.144
Well, the ceiling's twelve
feet from the floor.

17:38.480 --> 17:39.981
The curtains ignited high,

17:39.981 --> 17:41.733
and they burned,
dropped down.

17:46.821 --> 17:48.865
There's remnants
on the floor.

17:49.908 --> 17:52.202
I'll collect the fireworks and
the curtain remnants,

17:52.202 --> 17:54.454
and H wants that
soundproofing stuff.

17:54.454 --> 17:56.665
Okay.
Hey, look at this.

17:58.958 --> 17:59.960
What?

17:59.960 --> 18:01.920
I guess the DJ
recorded his shows.

18:01.920 --> 18:04.422
The recorder's damaged,
but maybe the tape's okay.

18:04.422 --> 18:06.007
Maybe that'll help us out.

18:06.424 --> 18:08.468
You do the sound and
the soundproofing,

18:08.468 --> 18:10.637
and I'll take care of
the rest, all right?

18:10.637 --> 18:11.680
Deal.

19:51.279 --> 19:53.031
Hey.
Hey, check this out.

19:53.031 --> 19:55.700
So I took the audio tape
of DJ Scorpious,

19:55.700 --> 19:57.744
I restored it,
I transferred it to digital,

19:57.744 --> 19:59.913
and then, I brought it up
on the computer.

19:59.913 --> 20:01.039
Listen.

20:01.539 --> 20:03.416
Yo, y'all, let's kick it trance
style with a new ...

20:03.416 --> 20:08.004
test press from my boys from
my-mo, d-day bomb squad.

20:11.007 --> 20:12.217
Okay, can you, uh,

20:12.217 --> 20:15.720
isolate the microphone track
and take away the music?

20:15.720 --> 20:17.722
Great minds.
Already done.

20:18.765 --> 20:20.558
Okay, this is what
the mike picked up.

20:20.558 --> 20:22.686
Now tell me if you
hear what I hear.

20:23.520 --> 20:25.480
Yo, y'all, let's kick it trance
style with a new test...

20:25.480 --> 20:29.859
press from my boys from my-mo,
d-day bomb squad.

20:33.279 --> 20:35.991
Amplify that last part.
Play it again.

20:42.330 --> 20:44.499
Those are accelerant
vapors being ignited.

20:44.499 --> 20:46.001
And the scent dogs
didn't pick it up.

20:46.001 --> 20:47.585
So, it means it was something
they weren't trained for.

20:47.585 --> 20:50.005
It wasn't gasoline,
paint thinner ...

20:50.005 --> 20:51.881
any of the usual suspects.

20:51.881 --> 20:54.718
Well ...
ethanol ...

20:54.718 --> 20:58.638
oak tannins,
saccharum officinarum.

20:58.638 --> 20:59.806
That's sugar cane.

20:59.806 --> 21:02.434
There's one type of
alcohol aged in oak barrels,

21:02.434 --> 21:04.394
distilled from
sugar cane.

21:04.394 --> 21:05.478
Rum.

21:05.478 --> 21:08.398
Well, imagine that,
alcohol in a club.

21:08.398 --> 21:11.359
The curtain behind the DJ
was doused with the stuff.

21:11.359 --> 21:13.528
Proximity, opportunity.

21:14.237 --> 21:16.031
Why are you guys
trying to grit me?

21:16.031 --> 21:17.574
I'm telling you right now,
straight up,

21:17.574 --> 21:18.908
I had nothing
to do with this.

21:19.242 --> 21:20.118
All right, first of all,

21:20.118 --> 21:22.078
let's go ahead and
drop that street thing,

21:22.078 --> 21:24.998
okay, because we know
that you're from Aspen.

21:25.415 --> 21:29.294
There was rum poured on
the curtain directly behind you.

21:33.131 --> 21:34.633
You were the first one out
of the club, Mason.

21:34.633 --> 21:36.134
It just doesn't look good.

21:36.760 --> 21:39.638
Don't you think I know people
paid money to see me spin,

21:39.929 --> 21:41.181
and now they're dead?

21:41.181 --> 21:43.600
I've got to sit with that
for the rest of my life.

21:43.600 --> 21:45.268
I did not pour the rum.

21:45.268 --> 21:46.936
Well, you did something.

21:46.936 --> 21:49.939
Yeah. I kicked over one
of the fountains.

21:49.939 --> 21:52.359
After it went off, I tried to stop
the fire, but it did not work.

21:52.359 --> 21:53.985
It made it worse,
so I bolted.

21:53.985 --> 21:55.862
What kind of pyro do you use?

21:55.862 --> 21:57.489
Standard, eight by ten.

21:58.114 --> 21:59.240
Can you clarify?

21:59.240 --> 22:01.076
It, uh, burns for eight seconds,

22:01.076 --> 22:02.202
and it shoots ten feet high.

22:02.202 --> 22:03.578
Nine-volt triggers it.

22:03.578 --> 22:06.498
Ignites black powder and
titanium particles.

22:11.419 --> 22:13.421
It practically burns cold, man.

22:13.421 --> 22:15.006
I mean, the tip of a
match is hotter.

22:15.006 --> 22:16.341
You can put your
hand right in it.

22:20.679 --> 22:21.972
Yeah, but a spark's
a spark,

22:21.972 --> 22:23.556
and you seem
to know all about it.

22:23.556 --> 22:24.766
Yeah, sparks are
show business.

22:24.766 --> 22:26.518
I'm in show business.

22:26.518 --> 22:29.229
Fire's a no-go.
I just play.

22:29.229 --> 22:30.981
Okay, well, do us a favor,

22:30.981 --> 22:34.359
and play close to
the sandbox, okay?

22:34.359 --> 22:36.569
Did you sign off on
the soundproofing?

22:36.569 --> 22:37.904
Not specifically.

22:37.904 --> 22:40.323
Okay, Ronnie, we are
not in a court of law yet.

22:40.323 --> 22:42.158
Yes or no?

22:42.158 --> 22:43.451
On the reinspect last month,

22:43.451 --> 22:46.121
we found egg crate material
that wasn't flame-resistant.

22:46.121 --> 22:48.289
Told him he had two
weeks to replace it.

22:48.289 --> 22:50.166
Went back, follow it up.

22:50.166 --> 22:52.127
Receipts checked out.
He upgraded.

22:52.127 --> 22:53.586
Did you retest?

22:53.586 --> 22:54.879
It's like a fix-it ticket.

22:54.879 --> 22:56.589
Show of proof,
gentleman's agreement.

22:56.589 --> 22:57.882
Our guy is no gentleman.

22:57.882 --> 22:59.718
Check out this burn damage.

23:00.260 --> 23:03.054
Yeah. Char's too deep.
Something's not right.

23:03.054 --> 23:03.805
Good news.

23:03.805 --> 23:06.057
My people will be able
to figure out why.

23:06.474 --> 23:08.476
If I somehow had
any part in this ...

23:08.476 --> 23:11.187
Let's not go there till we hear
back from trace, all right?

23:11.187 --> 23:12.564
Yeah.
Okay.

23:17.235 --> 23:19.612
With the room clean, we can
finally make some headway.

23:19.612 --> 23:21.948
Check out this burn
pattern on the stage floor.

23:21.948 --> 23:24.868
I guess the DJ was telling the
truth about that part of the story.

23:24.868 --> 23:26.703
He kicked one of
the fountains over.

23:29.080 --> 23:31.708
Well, he said the sparklers
shot up ten feet.

23:31.708 --> 23:35.045
Ceiling's twelve,
so that's a little bit of give.

23:35.045 --> 23:36.504
So the pyros kicked in,

23:36.504 --> 23:40.300
sprayed sparks towards
the ceiling onto the curtains,

23:40.300 --> 23:42.385
and then ignited the
vapors from the rum.

23:49.309 --> 23:50.435
Hey, Calleigh.

23:51.186 --> 23:54.105
Look at that.
That's a pour pattern.

23:57.609 --> 24:00.153
Somebody poured rum
on these curtains ...

24:01.196 --> 24:03.114
from here ...

24:05.200 --> 24:06.242
...to there.

24:15.627 --> 24:17.295
This room hasn't
been cleared.

24:22.050 --> 24:23.093
You guys get anything?

24:27.681 --> 24:28.723
Check that out.

24:28.723 --> 24:30.684
End table burned up
from below.

24:31.601 --> 24:33.103
That's interesting.

24:33.520 --> 24:36.022
Fire originated at the
DJ's station,

24:36.022 --> 24:39.192
climbed up and outward
across the ceiling,

24:39.484 --> 24:42.570
maintaining a high burn,
but in here ...

24:42.570 --> 24:44.406
in here, the burn is low.

24:44.406 --> 24:46.491
High burn in there,
low burn in here.

24:46.491 --> 24:49.160
Linked by a
common accelerant.

24:50.620 --> 24:51.997
You guys smell that?

24:51.997 --> 24:53.832
It's burnt flesh.
It's everywhere.

24:53.832 --> 24:56.293
Yeah, but it's more
pronounced in here, isn't it?

24:57.335 --> 24:58.920
Excuse me.

24:59.963 --> 25:01.798
A lot of drop down
right in this area.

25:01.798 --> 25:03.675
Speed, you want
to help me with this?

25:26.156 --> 25:27.324
Whoa.

25:27.324 --> 25:28.908
This could be the
missing bartender.

25:28.908 --> 25:30.618
Maybe he got caught in
here during the fire.

25:30.618 --> 25:34.789
Maybe he started it and
got caught in the middle of it.

25:37.334 --> 25:40.295
No, there's an awful lot
of blood for a burn victim.

25:40.295 --> 25:42.672
Yes, it certainly is
a lot of blood.

25:42.672 --> 25:47.052
Someone could have started
this fire to cover a murder.

25:59.429 --> 26:00.805
Victim was stabbed.

26:01.556 --> 26:05.602
He's got multiple incised wounds,
surrounded by contusions.

26:05.602 --> 26:07.479
That, and the
inconsistent pattern,

26:07.479 --> 26:09.564
tell me they weren't
from a knife blade.

26:09.564 --> 26:10.732
A broken bottle?

26:11.149 --> 26:13.777
Could be.
Let's see.

26:20.325 --> 26:21.576
Here you go.

26:22.619 --> 26:23.703
Colored glass.

26:23.703 --> 26:24.996
Amber.

26:24.996 --> 26:27.248
A shard may have
punctured his liver.

26:28.667 --> 26:31.127
Stabbers usually cut
themselves in the act.

26:31.127 --> 26:32.420
Okay, so that means we're
going to have to sift through

26:32.420 --> 26:35.090
every piece of debris that's
been through this area.

26:35.090 --> 26:37.133
It's separated by
rooms outside.

26:37.133 --> 26:38.218
I'll go.

26:41.346 --> 26:44.808
No soot in his
nose or mouth.

26:45.100 --> 26:47.727
He stopped breathing before
the fire broke out.

26:48.019 --> 26:49.604
Guess he didn't start it.

26:50.313 --> 26:51.940
Well, we can't
assume that yet,

26:51.940 --> 26:53.566
but what we can say ...

26:53.566 --> 26:55.860
is every time we
eliminate a suspect,

26:55.860 --> 26:57.445
another one pops up.

26:57.445 --> 26:58.488
Hang on.
Yeah?

26:58.488 --> 26:59.656
Squeeze play's paying off.

26:59.656 --> 27:02.409
The impound lot's getting a lot of
grief from our buddy, Quentin Haid.

27:02.409 --> 27:03.743
How many times has
he been there?

27:03.743 --> 27:05.120
Going on four.

27:18.383 --> 27:19.759
How you doing?

27:19.759 --> 27:21.094
Real good, thanks.

27:21.094 --> 27:21.970
Car's ready.

27:21.970 --> 27:23.430
Where is it?
Inside.

27:23.430 --> 27:25.015
Okay. Give us a
minute, will you?

27:25.015 --> 27:26.599
You betcha.
Thanks a lot.

27:27.308 --> 27:28.351
Ready?

27:30.854 --> 27:32.439
Okay, Pete has
released your car.

27:32.439 --> 27:34.315
You got to sign.
Right there.

27:35.358 --> 27:37.068
It's one garage to the back.

27:37.068 --> 27:38.111
It's all yours.

27:50.206 --> 27:51.374
They say ...

27:53.460 --> 27:56.796
That patience is a virtue.

27:58.715 --> 28:02.594
And it looks like the cash
survived the fire, huh?

28:03.678 --> 28:04.721
You got a warrant?

28:04.721 --> 28:06.556
Don't need one if
it's in plain sight.

28:06.556 --> 28:08.641
And I see over
$30,000 there.

28:08.641 --> 28:11.561
Not fifteen, like you said,
so what's up?

28:11.561 --> 28:13.730
I thought the bitch might
have stolen it out of my safe.

28:13.730 --> 28:15.106
And you know what?
I was right.

28:15.106 --> 28:16.483
Here's the problem
with that scenario:

28:16.483 --> 28:18.902
We found over twelve sets
of prints on that safe,

28:18.902 --> 28:19.944
all you.

28:20.695 --> 28:22.530
My own prints on
my own safe?

28:22.530 --> 28:23.448
Big deal.

28:23.448 --> 28:25.033
You do that every night,
don't you?

28:25.033 --> 28:26.826
Squirrel away a chunk so it
doesn't show up on the books.

28:26.826 --> 28:29.621
Just like you did last night
before you torched the place.

28:29.621 --> 28:30.705
Never happened.

28:30.705 --> 28:32.290
Why don't you let me
decide that?

28:32.290 --> 28:34.334
In the meantime,
I want you to hear me.

28:34.334 --> 28:36.378
If I find out you did this,

28:36.378 --> 28:38.338
if you hired somebody
to do this,

28:38.338 --> 28:40.924
if you stood there and
watched while it happened,

28:40.924 --> 28:42.425
I will get you.

28:42.425 --> 28:45.512
So, right now,
I will settle for pandering,

28:45.512 --> 28:47.597
but I want you to
think about Jill ...

28:47.597 --> 28:49.474
while you're being booked.

28:51.559 --> 28:52.811
Hands behind your back.

30:03.423 --> 30:05.508
Got the door?
Yeah.

30:10.388 --> 30:12.182
All right, right
behind you guys.

30:22.067 --> 30:23.902
Body's clear.
Room's all yours.

30:25.904 --> 30:27.113
Tim?

30:27.405 --> 30:28.490
What?

30:28.490 --> 30:29.532
You okay?

30:38.917 --> 30:40.085
Look at this.

30:41.127 --> 30:42.462
So it doesn't close.

30:43.505 --> 30:44.631
It's weighted.

30:45.674 --> 30:47.967
Should close by itself,
but it doesn't.

30:49.010 --> 30:50.887
And it didn't
the night of the fire.

30:54.015 --> 30:56.643
I was able to get out
because it was open.

30:57.477 --> 30:58.520
Light shined through.

30:59.479 --> 31:01.356
I remember trying to get
people out of this exit,

31:01.356 --> 31:03.274
but it was too close
to the flames.

31:03.566 --> 31:04.818
What are you getting at?

31:05.235 --> 31:08.196
Somebody left the
club in a hurry,

31:08.196 --> 31:12.075
right before the fire and
forgot to shut the door.

31:17.539 --> 31:21.710
And maybe, just after he
stabbed our bartender.

31:26.631 --> 31:28.717
Yeah, the only problem
is any blood ...

31:28.717 --> 31:30.969
would be too
degraded by the fire.

31:30.969 --> 31:33.096
But if you were the first one
out once the fire started,

31:33.096 --> 31:35.557
you probably touched the
blood when it was still wet.

31:36.182 --> 31:37.976
I didn't have any
blood on my hands.

31:39.769 --> 31:41.062
Wait a minute ...

31:42.105 --> 31:43.606
I remember thinking
that this was hot.

31:43.606 --> 31:45.025
I used my sleeve.

31:45.942 --> 31:47.610
You still have that shirt?

32:11.468 --> 32:13.803
Well, the blood sample from
Tim's shirt did have DNA,

32:13.803 --> 32:17.474
but no hit in CODIS and
nothing to match it to.

32:18.099 --> 32:21.478
Finished running background
on the club employees.

32:21.478 --> 32:22.771
Check this out.

32:22.771 --> 32:25.815
Danny Maxwell,
our Bouncer.

32:25.815 --> 32:29.861
No criminal history,
no pyro past, but get this:

32:30.153 --> 32:31.863
He's a three-time loser.

32:34.282 --> 32:36.284
Applied three times
over the last year ...

32:36.284 --> 32:38.662
to Miami-Dade
Fire Rescue.

32:38.662 --> 32:40.455
Rejected all three times.

32:40.455 --> 32:41.915
Whoa, back up, okay?

32:41.915 --> 32:45.335
I saw this guy run in from the
front and try to put out the fire.

32:45.335 --> 32:47.087
I mean, he pulled
bodies with me.

32:47.087 --> 32:50.131
Well, he does know the layout of
the club and all about the doors.

32:50.131 --> 32:53.718
And that blame would
go to the owner or the DJ.

32:53.718 --> 32:56.638
He started the fire so he
could pull people out...

32:56.638 --> 33:00.642
because it was his
dream to be a hero, right?

33:00.642 --> 33:03.144
And in the middle of it,
he stabbed his witness:

33:03.144 --> 33:04.437
The bartender.

33:05.146 --> 33:07.732
I'll get a warrant for his DNA,
and I'll work him.

33:07.732 --> 33:09.818
Hang on to that, Speed.
Eric?

33:13.363 --> 33:14.906
Eric, you have the
relationship with this guy.

33:14.906 --> 33:15.907
You can do it.

33:15.907 --> 33:17.409
Yeah.
All right.

33:17.409 --> 33:19.536
Um, what about
the warrant?

33:19.536 --> 33:21.871
He said he was going
to give blood today, so ...

33:21.871 --> 33:22.872
Okay, but remember.

33:22.872 --> 33:24.124
We are dealing
with a firestarter,

33:24.124 --> 33:25.125
and they can be very,

33:25.125 --> 33:28.253
I repeat, very
unpredictable, all right?

33:43.266 --> 33:45.519
Oh, hell, Mr. CSI.

33:45.519 --> 33:47.354
I must be in big trouble now.

33:47.354 --> 33:48.730
How's it going, Danny?

33:48.730 --> 33:50.899
Well, I had to wait in
line half the day.

33:50.899 --> 33:51.650
You here to give?

33:51.650 --> 33:52.484
No, no. I got to ...

33:52.484 --> 33:53.860
I got to get myself
psyched up.

33:53.860 --> 33:55.862
I, uh, never donated
blood before.

33:55.862 --> 33:57.906
I think I get enough
on the job.

33:58.949 --> 34:00.784
Okay, you can sit up now.

34:01.409 --> 34:02.452
Easy.

34:02.869 --> 34:04.579
Apply light pressure
on the arm.

34:04.579 --> 34:06.164
See you again
in eight weeks?

34:06.164 --> 34:07.374
I'll be here.

34:07.791 --> 34:09.501
So how's the
investigation going?

34:09.501 --> 34:10.710
It's looking like an accident.

34:10.710 --> 34:12.254
Possibly negligence.

34:12.254 --> 34:14.214
Your boss was into
some pretty shifty stuff,

34:14.214 --> 34:15.715
so we're bringing him up
on a few charges.

34:15.715 --> 34:16.882
So that's why you're here.

34:16.882 --> 34:19.177
We wanted to see if we
could count on you to testify ...

34:19.177 --> 34:20.262
as to what you
saw at the club.

34:20.262 --> 34:21.304
Definitely.

34:26.393 --> 34:27.351
That's great.

34:27.351 --> 34:29.312
Well, uh, Danny, would
you mind going down to CSI,

34:29.312 --> 34:31.022
giving my boss
a formal statement?

34:31.022 --> 34:32.690
Whatever you need, man.
Appreciate it.

34:32.690 --> 34:34.192
I think I'm going to stay ...

34:34.192 --> 34:35.150
and donate some
blood, do my part.

34:35.150 --> 34:36.027
That's great.

34:36.027 --> 34:37.987
You could save three
lives with one donation.

34:37.987 --> 34:39.447
I'll see you there, man.

34:47.956 --> 34:49.123
How's it going?

34:49.541 --> 34:51.168
Well, the piece of
soundproofing you gave me

34:51.168 --> 34:53.879
was indeed
flame-resistant at one time.

34:53.879 --> 34:55.922
At one time, but ...

34:55.922 --> 34:58.341
But we've recovered some trace
and the soundproofing ...

34:58.341 --> 34:59.134
was covered with it.

34:59.134 --> 35:01.553
The Fire Marshall did say there
was a compliance issue and

35:01.553 --> 35:04.931
that he ordered the owner
to get the flame-resistant foam.

35:04.931 --> 35:06.516
The receipt backs that up.

35:06.516 --> 35:09.686
Well, Mr. Compliance did in
fact get the safe stuff originally,

35:09.686 --> 35:12.439
but he altered it with things
like acetone, propane,

35:12.439 --> 35:14.191
other ingredients,
if you get my drift.

35:14.191 --> 35:15.358
I get your drift.

35:15.358 --> 35:16.735
I'd love to be there
when you tell him.

35:16.735 --> 35:19.196
His insurance guy's
going to love it even more.

35:19.196 --> 35:20.113
He's not in custody?

35:20.113 --> 35:22.032
His attorney popped
him out this morning,

35:22.032 --> 35:24.659
and the first call he
made was about his policy.

35:27.954 --> 35:30.457
Toni.
What do you have for me?

35:30.457 --> 35:31.625
News you can use.

35:31.625 --> 35:33.335
Blood from the
shirt Tim gave me ...

35:33.335 --> 35:35.378
matches the sample you
got from the blood bank.

35:35.378 --> 35:37.464
Okay, that's good.
Thanks.

35:37.964 --> 35:38.507
H.

35:39.049 --> 35:40.884
All signs point to
Danny Maxwell.

35:40.884 --> 35:42.260
You want to run him
over the coals?

35:42.260 --> 35:44.095
It's your interrogation, Eric.
But, uh

35:44.095 --> 35:45.639
... you've gained his trust.

35:45.639 --> 35:47.098
Now use it on him.

35:54.064 --> 35:56.066
Kill someone?
I saved lives.

35:56.066 --> 35:58.151
Eric, you were there.
You saw me.

35:58.151 --> 36:01.780
I-I should be getting a medal,
not the third degree.

36:01.780 --> 36:04.199
That's an ironic
choice of words.

36:04.199 --> 36:05.617
Look, Danny, prove us wrong.

36:05.617 --> 36:07.494
Show us the palms of
your hands.

36:07.494 --> 36:10.455
He's not going to do that,
'cause he's hiding a cut...

36:10.455 --> 36:14.292
from stabbing the one
witness to his crime.

36:14.292 --> 36:16.670
Look, it's okay.
Really, it doesn't matter.

36:16.670 --> 36:18.672
We found your blood on
the back exit door.

36:18.964 --> 36:20.173
So?

36:20.173 --> 36:22.634
So that puts you back
there before the fire...

36:22.634 --> 36:24.970
and after you
stabbed the bartender.

36:24.970 --> 36:27.597
But how would you even
be able to match my ... ?

36:32.602 --> 36:34.062
I see.

36:37.607 --> 36:40.110
Guess you didn't
donate blood after all.

36:41.444 --> 36:42.737
You took it.

36:43.780 --> 36:45.574
Your trash;
my evidence,

36:46.533 --> 36:49.786
along with a rejected
application to Miami-Dade Fire.

36:51.163 --> 36:53.331
"Nothing in this
applicant's profile ...

36:53.331 --> 36:56.001
stands out sufficiently to
recommend him for employment,"

36:56.001 --> 36:57.544
etcetera, etcetera.

36:58.587 --> 37:00.505
You started the fire
to be a hero ...

37:00.505 --> 37:02.591
so you could finally
get into the department?

37:03.049 --> 37:05.427
I'm really sorry that didn't
work out for you, pal.

37:08.054 --> 37:09.723
You doused those curtains ...

37:10.765 --> 37:12.809
and then you timed
it just right ...

37:12.809 --> 37:14.436
so that when
the pyro sparked,

37:14.436 --> 37:15.896
it would light your fire.

37:16.438 --> 37:18.565
Alcohol isn't typically
used as an accelerant...

37:18.565 --> 37:20.192
because the vapors
aren't as strong ...

37:20.192 --> 37:23.069
as those of a heavy
hydrocarbon, like gasoline.

37:23.069 --> 37:24.404
You knew that.

37:24.696 --> 37:27.157
You knew the dogs wouldn't
pick up on the scent, also.

37:27.157 --> 37:28.408
Somebody else did.

37:38.835 --> 37:39.961
Danny?

37:39.961 --> 37:41.546
What the hell are you doing?

38:02.776 --> 38:05.195
Yo, y'all, let's kick it trance
style with a new test...

38:05.195 --> 38:09.366
press from my boys from my-mo,
d-day bomb squad!

38:14.120 --> 38:16.498
You thought it was just
going to be a nice little fire,

38:16.498 --> 38:18.500
and you could race
on outside ...

38:18.500 --> 38:20.377
and come back in
and put it out.

38:24.756 --> 38:25.632
You just don't ...

38:25.632 --> 38:27.008
understand.

38:31.638 --> 38:32.806
I was born ...

38:33.348 --> 38:34.724
to be a fireman ...

38:35.267 --> 38:36.226
like my ...

38:36.226 --> 38:38.728
like my dad,
like my grandfather.

38:40.188 --> 38:41.815
I was born to help people.

38:42.440 --> 38:44.609
Yeah, well, a real firefighter would've
known that there are a hundred...

38:44.609 --> 38:48.029
variables that can turn a controlled
fire into a chain of disaster,

38:49.072 --> 38:51.074
... starting with the
flammable stage curtain.

38:51.074 --> 38:54.369
Yeah, and the fact that the DJ
happened to kick one sparkler...

38:54.369 --> 38:55.579
into your accelerant ...

38:55.579 --> 38:58.623
and light the place up
like a tinder box.

38:59.583 --> 39:00.834
This way!
Get to the door!

39:00.834 --> 39:03.503
And the club owner
happened to chain the exits.

39:03.503 --> 39:04.754
It's locked!
It's locked!

39:08.758 --> 39:10.510
I needed to stand out.

39:11.553 --> 39:13.638
Yeah, well, I guess you
stand out now.

39:26.818 --> 39:27.903
Hi.

39:28.195 --> 39:29.154
Hey.

39:29.154 --> 39:31.615
I'd like to donate blood in
honor of Connie Wilkes.

39:32.365 --> 39:33.158
Sure.

39:33.158 --> 39:36.161
Would you like a notification
card to be sent to her family?

39:36.161 --> 39:37.621
No, no, that's okay.

39:37.621 --> 39:38.872
It's just for me.

40:12.781 --> 40:15.408
What did I do now,
park in the red zone?

40:16.243 --> 40:17.744
We've been
able to prove ...

40:17.744 --> 40:19.412
that the fire was
set intentionally.

40:19.412 --> 40:21.122
Your bouncer,
Danny Maxwell,

40:21.122 --> 40:23.083
will be held responsible.

40:23.083 --> 40:25.252
Ah, so you were
wrong about me.

40:25.252 --> 40:26.294
Not entirely.

40:26.294 --> 40:27.963
This is a piece of soundproofing...

40:27.963 --> 40:30.507
that you spray-painted
to pretty up your club,

40:30.507 --> 40:32.759
in defiance of the
Fire Marshall ...

40:32.759 --> 40:35.762
and defrauding your
insurance company, right?

40:35.762 --> 40:38.807
If any false information
were filed intentionally,

40:38.807 --> 40:41.685
or alterations made to the
property without consent,

40:41.685 --> 40:43.436
the policy will be negated.

40:43.436 --> 40:46.481
So you will never,
ever get insurance again,

40:46.481 --> 40:48.525
and you will never
open another club.

40:48.525 --> 40:51.653
And even if you manage to
stay out of jail, which we doubt,

40:51.653 --> 40:54.406
you'll spend the next ten to
twenty years in and out of court.

40:54.406 --> 40:57.242
Last count, sixty-seven
plaintiffs ...

40:57.242 --> 40:59.369
filed a wrongful death
civil suit against you.

40:59.369 --> 41:03.540
And I know at least one judge
that will love to be there for that.

41:14.301 --> 41:15.552
Horatio.

41:15.552 --> 41:16.928
Hey, Ronnie.

41:19.014 --> 41:20.390
You okay?

41:21.433 --> 41:22.684
What's the matter?

41:23.185 --> 41:24.519
I'm going to resign.

41:24.519 --> 41:26.229
Wanted you to be
the first to know.

41:26.229 --> 41:27.355
Ronnie,

41:27.355 --> 41:28.982
you could not have prevented
what happened in there.

41:28.982 --> 41:30.400
All those souls, Horatio ...

41:30.400 --> 41:32.736
I understand that, but we
need more good men,

41:32.736 --> 41:35.572
not less, and now more
than ever, you know that.

41:36.615 --> 41:38.492
About the guilt?

41:39.534 --> 41:40.702
Ronnie ...

41:41.745 --> 41:44.831
Ronnie, the guilt
keeps us sharp.

41:44.831 --> 41:46.082
It makes us better.

41:49.211 --> 41:51.087
Now, will you at least
think about this?

41:54.508 --> 41:55.967
Thanks, Horatio.
