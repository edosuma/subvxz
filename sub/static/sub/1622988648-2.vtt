building these relationships.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Look...

15:07.458 --> 15:09.917
You did those jobs
for dough. Right?

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
'Cause you needed the work.
And...

15:13.083 --> 15:15.458
I don't know,
I hate to, like, blow your mind,

15:15.542 --> 15:17.208
but your situation has changed.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.542
Like, you don't need
to do anything anymore.

15:20.625 --> 15:22.792
Now you just do
what you wanna do.

15:22.875 --> 15:24.375
And whatever that is.

15:27.166 --> 15:29.625
Well, that's very
generous of you.

15:29.709 --> 15:32.208
You're my wife.
Come on.

15:32.291 --> 15:33.917
You must've thought about this.

15:35.792 --> 15:39.041
The reality of that's,
like, hard to process, you know?

15:39.125 --> 15:41.291
Like, my parents
were always broke,

15:41.375 --> 15:44.083
and I haven't spent a day
of my life, Shane,

15:44.166 --> 15:45.583
where I wasn't hustling

15:45.667 --> 15:48.834
or generally just worried
about money.

15:48.917 --> 15:51.000
Welcome to the rest
of your wonderful life.

15:53.625 --> 15:54.875

-Yeah. Okay.

16:00.792 --> 16:03.959
So I have this email here,
forwarded from my mother.

16:04.041 --> 16:05.291
Oh, an email from your mother.

16:06.458 --> 16:07.709
Okay. Okay.

16:07.792 --> 16:09.000
So, yesterday you said

16:09.083 --> 16:10.667
that we paid for the room
that we have.

16:10.750 --> 16:13.291
But actually we did pay
more money

16:13.375 --> 16:17.709
for the room
we don't have. So...

16:17.792 --> 16:20.417
I assure you,
your mother is only paying

16:20.500 --> 16:22.375
the rate for your current room.

16:23.542 --> 16:24.583
Right.

16:25.875 --> 16:27.083
You guys made a mistake.

16:27.917 --> 16:29.625
Okay? So just...

16:29.709 --> 16:31.834
just own up to your mistake,
it's all I'm asking.

16:31.917 --> 16:33.834
Well, if there's been a mistake,
I do apologize.

16:33.917 --> 16:35.375
I'm so very sorry.

16:38.250 --> 16:39.333
Thank you.

16:41.125 --> 16:44.250
Um, mistakes happen, you know,

16:44.333 --> 16:47.542
but I'm just on my honeymoon,
you know,

16:47.625 --> 16:49.250
and, uh, it's just not
the kind of trip

16:49.333 --> 16:51.542
where you wanna be
impacted negatively

16:51.625 --> 16:53.792
-by someone else's mistake.
-Oh, of course not.

16:53.875 --> 16:56.417
Right, so, I guess
I'm just wondering what, uh,

16:56.500 --> 16:58.834
you might be able to do for us
to make us feel better

16:59.625 --> 17:01.166
about the whole situation?

17:01.250 --> 17:03.041
Well, as I told you yesterday,

17:03.125 --> 17:04.959
the Pineapple Suite is occupied.

17:05.041 --> 17:06.625
Right. When are they leaving?

17:06.709 --> 17:09.500
The Volkmers are departing
the day before you,
on Wednesday.

17:09.583 --> 17:10.959
And due to our new
cleaning policy,

17:11.041 --> 17:13.333
there would not be enough time
to get you in there.

17:13.417 --> 17:15.333
Okay. Um...

17:15.417 --> 17:18.333
Do you think we can get
another kind of upgrade?

17:19.959 --> 17:22.959
Well, you and your wife
are in the biggest suite.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.500
Besides the Pineapple Suite.

17:25.083 --> 17:26.125
(LAUGHS)

17:27.417 --> 17:29.500
There is another suite
in the same category,

17:29.583 --> 17:31.000
with a slightly bigger
floor plan

17:31.083 --> 17:32.375
because it has a second
powder room.

-I could see if it's available.

17:33.917 --> 17:35.125

17:36.709 --> 17:38.667
Yeah. Great.

17:38.750 --> 17:41.166
Yeah, it's a garden suite,
so no ocean view,

17:41.250 --> 17:43.000
but it does have that
second toilet.

17:44.250 --> 17:47.458

the other room, um,

17:56.542 --> 17:58.667
I am hopeful
there's some other way

17:58.750 --> 18:00.166
we can make this up to you.

18:01.458 --> 18:03.959
Let me think on it, okay?

18:04.041 --> 18:06.041

26:27.250 --> 26:30.250

about you, congratulations.

26:30.834 --> 26:31.834
Thank you.

26:31.917 --> 26:34.125
I'm, actually, I'm having
a little career crisis,

26:34.208 --> 26:36.291
and I, uh, saw you working
over here,

26:36.375 --> 26:39.834
and I... I just wanted to say
that I admire you,

26:39.917 --> 26:42.250
and you've just accomplished
so much,

26:42.333 --> 26:46.208
and, as a woman, it's--
it's really-- it's inspiring,

26:46.291 --> 26:50.625
so I-- I-- I just wanted
to tell you that.

26:50.709 --> 26:53.917
-That's very sweet.
-Sure. (CHUCKLES)

26:54.000 --> 26:55.375
What's your career crisis?

26:56.750 --> 26:58.792
Oh, I don't know, um...

26:58.875 --> 27:01.750
It's a long story
but, uh, you know, I just--

27:01.834 --> 27:04.500
I've been hustling
my whole life,

27:04.583 --> 27:05.709
and I've made inroads,

27:05.792 --> 27:07.333
and it's not, like,
the best career,

27:07.417 --> 27:09.917
but it's not nothing either,
you know.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.667
Um, but Shane, my husband,

27:12.750 --> 27:15.000
he's from this very,
very wealthy family

27:15.083 --> 27:19.125
and he's very successful,
like way more than I am.

27:19.208 --> 27:21.917
And I just sometimes
feel like...

27:22.959 --> 27:24.959
I worry that his orbit is--

27:25.041 --> 27:28.333
is stronger than mine
and that, like,

27:28.417 --> 27:31.250
I don't know, that like
his gravitational pull

27:31.333 --> 27:36.417
is gonna like just suck me in
and, um...

27:36.500 --> 27:40.083
Like you'll become a moon
to his planet?

27:40.166 --> 27:43.709
Yes, and not only lose
my mediocre career,

27:43.792 --> 27:46.208
which is whatever,
but also, like, myself.

27:46.291 --> 27:49.125
-NICOLE: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
-Do you know what I'm saying?

27:49.208 --> 27:52.041
May I ask?
Did you sign a prenup?

27:52.125 --> 27:53.208
RACHEL: Yes.

27:53.291 --> 27:57.000
But it's, you know,
generous but--

27:57.083 --> 28:00.041
But if your marriage ends,
you're not set for life?

28:00.125 --> 28:04.375
No. I mean,
there's like a structure to it,

28:04.458 --> 28:06.125
and a time component,

28:06.208 --> 28:09.375
and it's like complicated,
but basically no.

28:09.458 --> 28:12.583
Then I think you've got to be
really careful.

28:12.667 --> 28:15.166
And you've got to keep
your own orbit going.

28:16.625 --> 28:20.375
Because you don't want
a few years down the line

28:20.458 --> 28:22.667
to have abandoned your career,

28:22.750 --> 28:24.875
and I'm not saying
this is gonna happen to you,

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
but marriages don't
always work out.

28:27.834 --> 28:29.291

you seem to be

28:29.375 --> 28:31.542

young woman.

28:33.083 --> 28:34.417
Thank you.

I wrote a profile about you.

uh, also, you know...

-Yes. (CHUCKLES)

-Mm-hmm.

-What?
-NICOLE: Yeah, I remember that.

29:45.375 --> 29:47.458

29:47.542 --> 29:52.041
Well, it was a puff piece.
Are you being serious?

I-- it said you were kicking
the corporate world's ass.

29:55.959 --> 29:59.083
No, you made it out like
I got my promotion

29:59.166 --> 30:00.959
because of optics.

30:01.041 --> 30:04.542
"She rode the Me Too wave."
Bullshit like that.

30:04.625 --> 30:06.834
Well, I couldn't not mention
the lawsuits.

30:06.917 --> 30:08.542
But you didn't have to
make me come across

30:08.625 --> 30:11.125
like I was some kind of
Machiavellian gorgon

30:11.208 --> 30:13.917
using the victimization
of the other women in my company

30:14.000 --> 30:17.583
just to further
my own craven ambitions.

30:19.083 --> 30:20.375
It didn't read like that.

30:20.458 --> 30:22.959

that hurts me,

30:23.041 --> 30:25.333

30:25.417 --> 30:27.709

I mean...

30:28.417 --> 30:29.583
It--

30:29.667 --> 30:32.375
I was just basically repurposing

the profile of you
from The Post.

30:34.291 --> 30:36.792
Well, then
that's bad journalism.

52:21.000 --> 52:24.792
CHARLIE: Well, your dad
didn't want anyone to know.

52:24.875 --> 52:26.542
And you were young.

52:26.625 --> 52:28.291

Your father, Mark,
he had sex with men.

53:01.875 --> 53:02.917
He did?

53:04.000 --> 53:05.583
CHARLIE: He had two lives.

53:06.458 --> 53:08.375
He had his family,

53:08.458 --> 53:11.417
and then he had another life

53:12.083 --> 53:14.125

Tanya gets these
incredible treatments

58:17.375 --> 58:18.750
from Belinda
and she just sees her

58:18.834 --> 58:22.458
as this magician, healer.
And she starts

58:22.834 --> 58:25.333
to really obsess about her
in a sense

58:25.417 --> 58:27.875
that she thinks maybe
this woman is the key

58:27.959 --> 58:29.875
to getting rid of all the pain
of her life.

58:29.959 --> 58:33.166
And in the second episode,
she has this idea

58:33.250 --> 58:35.709
that Belinda should have
her own wellness center.

She improves so quickly
that she realizes

58:49.000 --> 58:51.375
Belinda's a genius,
and that Belinda

58:51.458 --> 58:53.208
shouldn't be stuck
behind a counter

58:53.291 --> 58:54.959
in some hotel spa

58:55.041 --> 58:57.208

And I think she does want

59:00.583 --> 59:02.750
But I think she's a woman
with ADHD,

59:02.834 --> 59:04.667
so I think a lot of things
get in the way

59:04.750 --> 59:06.375
with promising things
to people,

59:06.458 --> 59:08.750
when you can barely deliver
for yourself.

59:08.834 --> 59:12.583
-You... You are so talented.
-Thank you.

59:12.667 --> 59:14.875
Because of her privilege,
she doesn't understand

59:14.959 --> 59:17.375
that gratitude can be expressed
outside of money.

59:17.458 --> 59:19.583

59:21.500 --> 59:23.917

especially at certain levels

59:24.000 --> 59:26.542
of class, is not necessarily
prevalent.

Shane gets the travel agent

59:40.000 --> 59:42.625
to call Armond
that he's under pressure

59:42.709 --> 59:44.792
to fix this mistake
that he's made

59:44.875 --> 59:47.333
and trying to make it right
with this guy who's on his back.

59:47.583 --> 59:49.792
And then he's got
real addiction issues,

59:49.875 --> 59:51.917
and this bag of pills
lands in his lap.

59:52.000 --> 59:53.750
He could disappear
and nobody could know.

59:53.834 --> 59:56.667
When you're under stress
and feeling in a weak state,

59:56.750 --> 59:59.125
the temptation that plays
into your weakness

59:59.208 --> 1:00:01.208
is right in front of you.
And it's tempting.

1:00:01.583 --> 1:00:03.041
So I think I'm gonna take
the job.

1:00:03.125 --> 1:00:05.375
You haven't worked for like
the last couple months.

1:00:05.458 --> 1:00:06.500
I was dealing with
the wedding.

1:00:06.583 --> 1:00:08.291
You're gonna take a job
while we're here?

1:00:08.375 --> 1:00:09.875
That's rude. No.

1:00:10.709 --> 1:00:12.083
JAKE LACY: Shane has
an expectation that's like,

1:00:12.291 --> 1:00:14.834
"I have all the money,
and I provide this lifestyle.

1:00:14.917 --> 1:00:16.750
And the thing you provide
is to shut up

1:00:16.834 --> 1:00:17.709
and go along with it."

1:00:17.959 --> 1:00:20.542
Shane feels all relationships
are a deal,

1:00:20.625 --> 1:00:22.291
and in this regard,
this is a great deal.

1:00:22.375 --> 1:00:25.000
Everyone gets what they want.
And all she has to do

1:00:25.083 --> 1:00:25.875
is enjoy it.

1:00:26.125 --> 1:00:28.083
I don't know, I hate
to like blow your mind,

1:00:28.166 --> 1:00:29.333
but your situation has changed.

1:00:29.750 --> 1:00:31.667
You don't need to do anything
anymore,

1:00:31.750 --> 1:00:33.500
now you just do what you want
to do,

1:00:33.750 --> 1:00:34.792
and whatever that is.

1:00:35.375 --> 1:00:38.458
ALEXANDRA DADDARIO:
Shane thinks that he views
his wife as an equal,

1:00:38.542 --> 1:00:39.834
he thinks he's wonderful
to her

1:00:39.917 --> 1:00:42.083
and he's not listening
to her problems

1:00:42.166 --> 1:00:44.375
because he just doesn't
understand her problems.

1:00:44.458 --> 1:00:47.000
Because, for him,
I'm hysterical about the fact

1:00:47.083 --> 1:00:49.792
I can't make 200 dollars
writing hack-job articles

1:00:49.875 --> 1:00:51.250
that are clickbait.
But, for me,

1:00:51.333 --> 1:00:53.583
that's my entire career
and that's my entire life.

1:00:55.166 --> 1:00:58.375
CONNIE BRITTON: The scene starts
where Nicole is actually

1:00:58.458 --> 1:01:01.875
very flattered that
this young woman admires her,

1:01:01.959 --> 1:01:05.041
and is seeking her advice.
And those are all things

1:01:05.125 --> 1:01:09.709
that enflame Nicole's ego
and all of the things

1:01:09.792 --> 1:01:11.208
that she values about herself.

1:01:11.291 --> 1:01:13.375
I just wanted to say
that I admire you.

1:01:13.458 --> 1:01:15.667
As a woman, it's really--
it's inspiring.

1:01:15.750 --> 1:01:19.166
DADDARIO:
She's reaching out to this
woman who's accomplished,

1:01:19.250 --> 1:01:23.041
for encouragement.
And the turn is hilarious,

1:01:23.125 --> 1:01:26.333
because essentially
I get completely shut down

1:01:26.417 --> 1:01:28.875
and it becomes a very
negative experience.

1:01:28.959 --> 1:01:31.709
I actually-- I wrote a profile
about you.

1:01:31.959 --> 1:01:34.250
"Ten Power Women
in the Tech World."

1:01:34.333 --> 1:01:37.834
Yeah, I remember that.
That was a hatchet job.

1:01:40.458 --> 1:01:41.792
Hey! (CHUCKLES)

1:01:41.875 --> 1:01:43.041
FRED HECHINGER: Quinn spends
a lot of time

1:01:43.125 --> 1:01:44.041
with his dad in the show.

1:01:44.417 --> 1:01:47.792
He is talking all the time
and I say very few words.

1:01:47.875 --> 1:01:50.125
Every day sort of spinning
a new epiphany.

1:01:50.208 --> 1:01:52.917
I thought I had cancer.
We've got to make the most

1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:55.667
out of every moment.
Let's mix it up, let's bro out,

1:01:55.750 --> 1:01:56.625
come on!

1:01:56.959 --> 1:01:58.458
HECHINGER: Time is valuable,
and generationally,

1:01:58.542 --> 1:02:00.625
you have to look at fathers
and the way that they change.

1:02:00.709 --> 1:02:04.083
He speaks to being raised
by a dad who's so private

1:02:04.166 --> 1:02:05.834
with his life and didn't do
any of the parenting.

1:02:05.917 --> 1:02:07.375
So now suddenly,
you have a father

1:02:07.458 --> 1:02:09.250
who was raised that way
and is trying

1:02:09.333 --> 1:02:11.166
to actually step in,
and doesn't really know

1:02:11.250 --> 1:02:12.458
his own responsibility.

1:02:12.542 --> 1:02:13.917
Is that a water bong?

1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:15.917
-Uh, we found it on the beach.
-It's prescription.

1:02:16.500 --> 1:02:19.959
BRITTANY O'GRADY:
Paula finds Olivia's parents
to be out-of-touch,

1:02:20.041 --> 1:02:23.417
and a couple that benefits
from privilege.

1:02:23.500 --> 1:02:25.834
And that's something that,
after a while,

1:02:25.917 --> 1:02:27.542
starts to rub Paula
the wrong way.

1:02:27.625 --> 1:02:30.375
Most people admire people
who achieve things,

1:02:30.834 --> 1:02:32.333
but you somehow look at it
as if it's

1:02:32.417 --> 1:02:33.667
a personality disorder.

1:02:33.750 --> 1:02:35.375
What exactly are you
getting done?

1:02:35.750 --> 1:02:39.333
Putin is an over-achiever.
He's impressive, also evil.

1:02:39.417 --> 1:02:43.125
-Liv, you mother is not Putin.
-Thank you.

1:02:43.375 --> 1:02:45.542
O'GRADY: Creating this duality
within Paula,

1:02:45.625 --> 1:02:48.166
where she could exist
in a wealthy,

1:02:48.250 --> 1:02:51.083
upper-class, homogenous space.
But, really,

1:02:51.166 --> 1:02:52.917
at the end of the day,
not being accepted.

1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:55.166
And that's why she starts
to connect with someone else

1:02:55.250 --> 1:02:58.500
while she is on vacation
with Olivia's family.

1:02:59.375 --> 1:03:01.917
White Lotus  is making a comment
about wealth and privilege.

1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:04.250
Some of these problems
that these people have,

these are problems
with solutions,

1:03:06.125 --> 1:03:07.959
