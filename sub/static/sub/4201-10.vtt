WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:03.536
April:
PREVIOUSLY ON  CHASING LIFE...

00:03.571 --> 00:05.272
I'M JUST TRYING TO DO
WHATEVER I CAN TO MAKE MYSELF
HAPPY AND FEEL BETTER.

00:05.306 --> 00:07.775
-YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO GET OVER IT.
-GET OVER MY DEAD HUSBAND?

00:08.007 --> 00:09.243
WHY THE HELL HADN'T
I THOUGHT OF THAT?

00:09.275 --> 00:12.146
Winter storm Pam should hit
New York later today

00:12.179 --> 00:14.115
dumping at least
a foot of snow.

00:14.147 --> 00:15.516
JUST COORDINATING MAE'S TRAVEL.

00:15.548 --> 00:18.018
LISTEN, ARE YOU GUYS SURE
IT'S OKAY IF SHE STAYS HERE?

00:18.051 --> 00:20.388
-OF COURSE.
-GUESS I REALLY AM
MY FATHER'S DAUGHTER--

00:20.420 --> 00:22.323
THEY WAY I'M ACTING
BECAUSE LEO DIED

00:22.356 --> 00:24.524
AND THE WAY DAD WAS ACTING
BECAUSE YOUR MOM WAS PRESSURING
HIM TO BE WITH HER.

00:24.557 --> 00:26.727
-WHO TOLD YOU THAT?
-GEORGE.

00:28.428 --> 00:29.562
WE NEED TO TALK.

00:29.597 --> 00:31.632
I KNOW,
I ATE ALL THE HUMMUS.

00:31.664 --> 00:34.268
I'LL RESTOCK YOU GUYS
BEFORE I LEAVE.

00:34.301 --> 00:36.369
IT'S NOT THAT. IT'S...

00:36.404 --> 00:39.372
I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS
ABOUT SOMETHING YOU MENTIONED
THE OTHER DAY ABOUT DAD.

00:39.406 --> 00:41.274
OH. WHAT'S UP?

00:41.307 --> 00:44.145
REMEMBER HOW YOU SAID
OLIVIA WAS PRESSURING HIM
TO GET BACK TOGETHER?

00:44.177 --> 00:46.280
UH, I THINK SO.

00:46.313 --> 00:48.682
WELL, I MENTIONED THAT TO
NATALIE, AND SHE SAYS THAT HER
MOM'S BEEN IN

00:48.716 --> 00:50.451
A SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP
FOR YEARS.

00:51.719 --> 00:52.552
HUH.

00:54.521 --> 00:56.457
DID YOU KNOW MARCO?

00:56.490 --> 00:58.725
I MEAN, IF YOU'VE KNOWN OLIVIA
AND NATALIE THIS LONG,

00:58.759 --> 01:00.594
YOU MUST HAVE CROSSED PATHS
AT SOME POINT.

01:00.628 --> 01:02.695
UH, I MEAN...

01:03.831 --> 01:06.400
YEAH, NOW THAT
I THINK OF IT, I...

01:06.433 --> 01:10.504
YEAH, I-- I DO REMEMBER A GUY
WHO WAS AROUND OLIVIA.

01:11.805 --> 01:15.643
MAYBE NATALIE DIDN'T KNOW
HER MOM STILL HAD FEELINGS
FOR DAD?

01:17.611 --> 01:19.646
HOW SURE ARE YOU
ABOUT THIS OLIVIA THING?

01:19.680 --> 01:20.847
I'M REALLY NOT.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.450
UM, IT WAS SO LONG AGO,
I'M JUST GUESSING.

01:23.484 --> 01:25.286
S-- SORRY.
I WISH I COULD BE MORE HELPFUL.

01:26.387 --> 01:29.789
AND THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE GOING
ON WITH DAD DURING THAT TIME?

01:29.823 --> 01:32.659
UH, JUST THE USUAL:
PRESSURES FROM WORK.

01:32.692 --> 01:36.162
I KNOW HIS EDITOR WAS ALL OVER
HIM ABOUT FINISHING THAT
SPY NOVEL.

01:38.164 --> 01:39.700
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT THE BOOK.

01:39.733 --> 01:41.301
(phone vibrating)

01:42.603 --> 01:45.706
OH, SORRY.
THIS IS FROM, UH, THE AIRLINE.

01:45.739 --> 01:48.375
I'M FLYING OUT AFTER DINNER
WITH MAE.

01:48.408 --> 01:50.677
-I REALLY NEED TO--
-HELLO, APRIL.

01:50.710 --> 01:54.215
-HI, MAE.
-GEORGE, DID YOU GET THE QUART-
SIZED BAGS FOR THE TOILETRIES?

01:54.247 --> 01:55.716
-I DID.
-THANK YOU.

01:55.748 --> 01:59.453
AND SINCE THE AIRLINE IS TELLING
ME THAT OUR FLIGHT IS ON TIME,

01:59.486 --> 02:01.188
I REALLY SHOULD
START PACKING SOON.

02:02.623 --> 02:03.858
YOU HAVEN'T PACKED YET?

02:13.467 --> 02:16.603
-(theme music playing)
-♪ YOU BET YOUR SOUL, HONEY ♪

02:16.637 --> 02:19.639
♪ YOU BET YOUR SOUL ♪

02:19.673 --> 02:24.578

02:24.611 --> 02:29.550

02:38.591 --> 02:40.260
I THINK HE'S LYING.

02:40.293 --> 02:41.562
I REALLY DO.

02:41.594 --> 02:44.397
IT'S NOT THAT OUT THERE
FOR GEORGE TO LIE,

02:44.430 --> 02:47.468
AS THE PERSON WHO'S EXISTENCE
HE DENIED FOR YEARS.

02:47.501 --> 02:50.871
Brenna: WELL, TECHNICALLY, HE
DIDN'T DENY YOUR EXISTENCE.

02:50.905 --> 02:52.539
NO ONE ASKED HIM.

02:52.573 --> 02:53.706
HEY, BREN, ISN'T THE ROLE

02:53.740 --> 02:54.775
OF THE DOCUMENTARIAN

02:54.807 --> 02:55.876
TO REMAIN OBJECTIVE?

02:55.909 --> 02:58.711
I'M REINVENTING THE GENRE,

02:58.746 --> 03:01.282
AND IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE
UNCLE GEORGE IS LYING.

03:01.314 --> 03:03.349
IT SOUNDS LIKE HE JUST
GOT HIS FACTS WRONG.

03:04.350 --> 03:06.252
WHEN I FIRST TOLD HIM
ABOUT THE BOOK,

03:06.287 --> 03:08.656
HE ACTED LIKE HE DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW IT EXISTED,

03:08.688 --> 03:11.658
AND THEN TODAY, HE JUST HAPPENS
TO REMEMBER

03:11.692 --> 03:14.929
DAD BEING STRESSED OUT ABOUT
TURNING HIS SPY NOVEL IN
ON TIME? I--

03:14.961 --> 03:18.264
YEAH, NOT TO MENTION THE LIE
HE TOLD ABOUT MY MOM
STILL WANTING OUR DAD.

03:18.299 --> 03:19.533
Brenna:
I HAVE A QUESTION,

03:19.567 --> 03:22.269
BUT, APRIL, YOU CAN'T
GET MAD AT ME FOR ASKING.

03:22.302 --> 03:25.605
IF YOU THINK I'M GONNA
GET MAD AT YOU FOR ASKING
A QUESTION, THEN...

03:25.639 --> 03:27.473
YOU'RE TURNING
THE CAMERA OFF FIRST.

03:27.508 --> 03:30.644
I DO NOT NEED BERKELEY'S
SUMMER FILMMAKING PROGRAM
THIS UP IN MY BUSINESS.

03:31.711 --> 03:32.780
OKAY, FINE.

03:36.716 --> 03:38.519
ARE YOU SURE

03:38.551 --> 03:40.653
GEORGE SAID THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW
THERE WAS A BOOK?

03:40.687 --> 03:43.723
I MEAN, YOU'VE BEEN GOING
THROUGH A LOT LATELY.

03:43.757 --> 03:46.526
IT'S POSSIBLE YOU MIGHT HAVE
JUST REMEMBERED WRONG.

03:48.495 --> 03:50.563
AND I KNEW THAT YOU WOULD
GET MAD AT ME,

03:50.598 --> 03:53.667
BUT, SERIOUSLY,
WHAT IS THERE LEFT TO HIDE?

03:53.700 --> 03:56.402
WHAT IS MORE OF A SECRET
THAN A SECRET FAMILY?

03:56.437 --> 03:59.506
I MEAN, TWO SECRET FAMILIES?

03:59.539 --> 04:00.608
DUDE!

04:00.640 --> 04:02.610
WHY WOULD GEORGE
GO TO ALL THE TROUBLE

04:02.643 --> 04:04.711
TO KEEP ANOTHER FAMILY FROM US,

04:04.745 --> 04:06.379
AFTER WE FOUND OUT
ABOUT NATALIE?

04:06.413 --> 04:07.580
April: OKAY, LISTEN.

04:07.615 --> 04:10.350
EVERYONE IN THAT BOOK
WAS BASED OFF OF ONE OF US

04:10.384 --> 04:12.519
OR SOMEONE WE KNOW,

04:12.552 --> 04:14.288
EXCEPT FOR ONE CHARACTER.

04:14.320 --> 04:15.588
-THE WOMAN AT LANGLEY.
-YES,

04:15.622 --> 04:17.591
AND HE FOCUSED A LOT OF
THE STORY ON HER,

04:17.625 --> 04:18.725
SO WHO'S SHE BASED ON?

04:18.759 --> 04:21.661
OH, I KNOW.

04:21.694 --> 04:25.365
SHE'S BASED ON
DAD'S SECRET SISTER. THAT'S IT.

04:25.399 --> 04:27.968
AND SHE'S IN CAHOOTS WITH
UNCLE GEORGE

04:28.002 --> 04:31.704
WHO'S NOT THIS AMAZING DOCTOR,
BUT, NO, A SPY,

04:31.738 --> 04:33.374
WHO'S A PART OF THIS WHOLE

04:33.406 --> 04:36.543
WORLD-WIDE SECRET FAMILY
CONSPIRACY.

04:37.911 --> 04:40.613
THAT'S HOW CRAZY YOU GUYS SOUND.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.350
WHATEVER. I WANT TO REREAD
THAT PART

04:43.384 --> 04:44.851
-OF THE BOOK ABOUT HER.
-ME TOO.

04:44.884 --> 04:48.521
OKAY, WELL WRITE ME A POSTCARD
FROM CRAZY TOWN.

04:48.555 --> 04:50.691
I HEAR IT'S BEAUTIFUL THERE
THIS TIME OF YEAR.

04:54.427 --> 04:57.764
HEY, BETH. WOW, IT'S
REALLY COMING DOWN OUT THERE.

04:58.598 --> 05:01.834
APRIL DIDN'T TELL ME
YOU WERE COMING OVER.

05:01.869 --> 05:04.038
OH, I-- I KIND OF
DIDN'T TELL HER THAT I WAS.

05:05.072 --> 05:06.607
YOU TWO STILL HAVEN'T SPOKEN?

05:06.639 --> 05:08.675
NO, SO I JUST DECIDED

05:08.709 --> 05:11.577
TO SHOW UP IN THE MIDDLE OF A
SNOWSTORM LIKE AN INSANE PERSON.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.646
YOU'RE NOT INSANE.
YOU'RE A GOOD FRIEND.

05:13.680 --> 05:14.981
APRIL'S UPSTAIRS.

05:15.014 --> 05:16.684
APRIL'S RIGHT HERE.

05:19.420 --> 05:20.521
EVERYTHING OKAY?

05:21.588 --> 05:22.889
YOU HAVEN'T REPLIED
TO MY TEXTS.

05:22.923 --> 05:23.990
WHAT? I REPLIED.

05:24.024 --> 05:26.060
APRIL, A BITMOJI DOESN'T COUNT.

05:26.093 --> 05:27.661
IT SAID, "ALL GOOD."

05:27.694 --> 05:29.997
OKAY. UH...

05:30.029 --> 05:31.899
THEN I GUESS I'LL JUST, UH...

05:31.932 --> 05:35.769
-HEAD BACK OUT INTO
THE FREEZING COLD, AND--
-NO! PLEASE DON'T.

05:35.802 --> 05:39.505
AS YOUR SURROGATE BOSTON MOTHER,
I'M NOT LETTING YOU LEAVE.

05:39.540 --> 05:40.841
GEORGE IS FLYING HOME LATER,

05:40.874 --> 05:42.942
AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE
AN EARLY DINNER,
MAYBE SOME GAMES.

05:44.411 --> 05:45.545
-OKAY.
-OKAY.

05:47.947 --> 05:50.417
OR-- SORRY. IS THAT ALL GOOD?

05:50.451 --> 05:52.685
OF COURSE. ALL GOOD.

06:00.560 --> 06:03.730
Sarah: WELL, BERKELEY IS
SUCH A GREAT SCHOOL, BRENNA.

06:03.764 --> 06:05.466
YOU HAVE THE GRADES,

06:05.499 --> 06:07.867
AND I BET YOU THE SUMMER PROGRAM
WOULD REALLY HELP
WITH ADMISSIONS.

06:07.901 --> 06:10.069
MOM, STOP.
I'M NOT GOING TO COLLEGE.

06:10.103 --> 06:13.540
I'M ONLY GOING TO BERKELEY
FOR THE SUMMER, AND THAT'S ONLY
IF I GET IN.

06:13.574 --> 06:16.543
WELL, IF YOU'RE NEW FILM IS
ANYTHING LIKE THE ONE YOU
PREMIERED IN NORTHEASTERN,

06:16.576 --> 06:17.778
IT'S A SHOE-IN.

06:17.810 --> 06:18.946
WHAT DID YOU PREMIER?

06:18.978 --> 06:21.014
UH, THAT FILM I DID WITH FORD.

06:21.048 --> 06:24.384
THE NEXT ONE I'M MAKING IS
DOCUMENTARY STYLE
ABOUT OUR FAMILY,

06:24.418 --> 06:26.552
SO BRING ON THE DRAMA.

06:26.586 --> 06:28.755
OH, THAT'LL BE NO PROBLEM.

06:28.788 --> 06:32.725
NOT TOO MUCH, THOUGH.
I DON'T WANT IT TO BE
UNREALISTIC.

06:33.793 --> 06:35.762
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I LOVE DOCUMENTARIES.

06:35.795 --> 06:37.630
I CAN'T STOP WATCHING
MY 600-LB LIFE.

06:37.663 --> 06:39.031
IT MAKES ME FEEL SO TINY.
(giggles)

06:39.066 --> 06:42.034
THAT'S NOT A DOCUMENTARY.
THAT'S A REALITY SHOW.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.903
YEAH, IT'S THE SAME THING.

06:45.172 --> 06:47.707
Sara: MAE, HOW WAS YOUR
PRESENTATION AT COLUMBIA?

06:47.740 --> 06:50.711
I'VE NEVER FELT SO POPULAR.
THERE WERE 11 PEOPLE
IN THE AUDIENCE.

06:50.744 --> 06:53.646
IT'S BECAUSE THERE IS LESS THAN
A DOZEN EXPERTS IN THE
ENTIRE WORLD

06:53.680 --> 06:54.747
WHO CAN UNDERSTAND
HER RESEARCH.

06:54.781 --> 06:57.016
(chuckles)

06:57.050 --> 06:59.153
HEY, MAYBE WE SHOULD START
THINKING ABOUT GETTING
TO THE AIRPORT?

06:59.185 --> 07:01.154
Mae: YEAH, IT MIGHT TAKE
A LITTLE LONGER IN THIS WEATHER.

07:01.187 --> 07:03.089
SARA, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR YOUR HOSPITALITY.

07:03.122 --> 07:04.524
-YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.
-UNCLE GEORGE?

07:05.959 --> 07:08.161
BEFORE YOU LEAVE, CAN I GET
THAT MANUSCRIPT BACK FROM YOU?

07:08.194 --> 07:10.831
WELL, ACTUALLY, I'M
STILL READING IT. CAN I
MAIL IT TO YOU WHEN I'M DONE?

07:10.863 --> 07:13.000
(scoffs) YOU STILL
HAVEN'T FINISHED HALF OF A BOOK?

07:13.033 --> 07:17.504
HE'S BEEN A LITTLE BUSY GETTING
APRIL INTO HER TRIAL
AND EVERYTHING.

07:17.538 --> 07:18.672
I'VE HAD A FEW DISTRACTIONS.

07:18.704 --> 07:20.106
HEY, GEORGE,

07:20.139 --> 07:22.709
YOU PROMISED WE'D PLAY AT LEAST
ONE GAME BEFORE YOU LEFT.

07:24.144 --> 07:26.180
OKAY. OKAY, ONE GAME.

07:26.213 --> 07:27.781
PICK ONE.

07:27.814 --> 07:30.149
I REMEMBER PACKING YOUR
BOARD GAMES AT THE APARTMENT.

07:30.184 --> 07:33.754
OH, UM, MAYBE THEY'RE IN ONE OF
THE BOXES IN MY ROOM.
I'LL GO CHECK.

07:33.786 --> 07:35.755
MAYBE YOU CAN FIND A
OUIJA BOARD UP THERE.

07:35.788 --> 07:37.757
WE CAN ASK DAD A FEW QUESTIONS.

07:50.670 --> 07:52.572
WHY IS EVERYTHING WET?

08:08.689 --> 08:11.190
GOT YOU A LITTLE SOMETHING TO
TAKE BACK TO NEW YORK WITH YOU.

08:11.225 --> 08:14.795
AW, DAD. YOU'RE THE ONE
WITH THE BIRTHDAY COMING UP.

08:15.928 --> 08:17.898
FATHER'S RESERVE THE RIGHT
TO GET THEIR DAUGHTERS GIFTS

08:17.930 --> 08:19.665
WHENEVER THE HELL
THEY FEEL LIKE IT.

08:20.733 --> 08:23.769
IT'S WHAT WE GET IN EXCHANGE
FOR NOT HAVING ANYONE TO
PLAY CATCH WITH.

08:23.803 --> 08:25.172
SORRY, NOT FEMINIST.

08:25.204 --> 08:28.709
OH, MOM AND I HAVE
TRAINED YOU WELL. (chuckles)

08:30.677 --> 08:32.812
THIS WAY YOU'LL
ALWAYS FEEL CLOSE TO HOME.

08:33.813 --> 08:36.015
AND, UH, MAYBE YOU'LL THINK OF
ME WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT.

08:38.085 --> 08:39.653
WHEN ARE YOU BACK
FROM FLORIDA?

08:39.686 --> 08:40.921
ACTUALLY, I'M GOING TO
BALTIMORE FIRST.

08:40.953 --> 08:42.121
WHAT'S IN BALTIMORE?

08:43.523 --> 08:44.725
YOU KNOW,
JUST RESEARCH STUFF.

08:44.758 --> 08:45.926
I CAN'T KEEP UP,

08:45.959 --> 08:47.827
BUT YOU'RE GONNA BE BACK
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY RIGHT?

08:47.860 --> 08:50.596
BECAUSE I AM COMING UP, AND I AM
TAKING YOU TO MAMA MARIA'S.
YOU'RE FAVORITE.

08:50.630 --> 08:52.566
BUT YOU JUST GOT TO NEW YORK
A COUPLE MONTHS AGO.

08:52.599 --> 08:55.802
-YOU'RE ROOMMATE JUST MOVED IN.
I CAN'T BE--
-YES YOU CAN.

08:55.836 --> 08:58.838
ELLIE'S GONNA TAKE SOME TIME
GETTING USED TO,
SO I DON'T MIND A BREAK.

08:58.871 --> 09:01.207
AND I-- I WANT TO THANK YOU.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.844
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE AN AWESOME DAD.
I'M LUCKY.

09:10.783 --> 09:11.951
ARE YOU CRYING?

09:13.086 --> 09:14.654
DAD, I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
CRY BEFORE.

09:14.687 --> 09:15.956
IT'S THIS DAMN HOUSE
FULL OF WOMEN...

09:17.024 --> 09:18.658
MAKING ME SOFT.

09:18.692 --> 09:19.793
NOT FEMINIST.

09:19.826 --> 09:20.860
(chuckles)

09:24.697 --> 09:25.765
Sara:  APRIL?

09:26.933 --> 09:29.201
DID YOU FIND  TRIVIAL PURSUIT?

09:29.235 --> 09:31.638
I THOUGHT IT COULD BE FUN
FOR US ALL TO PLAY,
AND I CAN'T FIND IT.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.740
NO, I THINK GRANDMA STOLE IT.

09:33.774 --> 09:35.942
SHE TOOK  BALDERDASH  TOO.

09:37.778 --> 09:38.812
WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:38.845 --> 09:41.847
JUST THINKING ABOUT DAD.

09:41.881 --> 09:43.616
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

09:45.318 --> 09:47.754
THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT,
THE MORE I HAVE THIS
NAGGING FEELING THAT...

09:47.788 --> 09:50.356
WHEN HE SAID GOODBYE TO ME
FOR THE LAST TIME...

09:52.058 --> 09:54.695
IT'S LIKE HE KNEW IT WAS
THE LAST TIME.

09:54.727 --> 09:56.763
WHEN WE LOOK BACK

09:56.797 --> 09:59.032
ON BIG MOMENTS FROM OUR PAST

09:59.066 --> 10:02.168
WE DON'T ALWAYS REMEMBER THEM
EXACTLY THE WAY THEY HAPPENED.

10:02.201 --> 10:03.703
NO.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.940
HE WAS SO EMOTIONAL.

10:06.974 --> 10:10.610
HE CRIED. DAD NEVER CRIED.
I MEAN--

10:13.647 --> 10:15.081
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHY HE WENT TO BALTIMORE?

10:17.283 --> 10:18.719
NO, I DON'T.

10:18.751 --> 10:21.620
HE TRAVELED SO MUCH.

10:21.654 --> 10:25.826
HONEY, REALLY, THIS IS NOT A
MYSTERY THAT NEEDS TO BE SOLVED.

10:25.859 --> 10:28.195
YOUR FATHER WAS
A COMPLICATED MAN,
TO SAY THE LEAST.

10:30.197 --> 10:35.701
AND I THINK THERE'S A DANGER OF
YOUR NOT BEING PRESENT IN YOUR
OWN LIFE RIGHT NOW.

10:37.336 --> 10:42.375
AND ALL THE THINGS THAT COULD BE
EXCITING ABOUT IT, AND ALL THE
PEOPLE WHO LOVE YOU,

10:42.408 --> 10:47.080
BECAUSE YOU'RE FOCUSING SO MUCH
ON SOMEONE ELSE'S PAST.

10:47.114 --> 10:48.849
SOMEONE WHO IS GONE.

10:55.721 --> 10:57.857
YOU'RE RIGHT. (chuckles)

10:59.725 --> 11:01.327
-I'LL SEE YOU DOWNSTAIRS.
-YEAH.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.765
BRING  SCRABBLE.

11:27.453 --> 11:31.091
GETTING A LITTLE LIQUID COURAGE
BEFORE WE HIT UNCLE GEORGE WITH
THE TOUGH QUESTIONS.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.427
I SAY WE JUST ASK HIM ABOUT
FAMILY NUMBER THREE.

11:34.461 --> 11:36.395
MAYBE BRENNA'S RIGHT.

11:36.429 --> 11:39.399
MAYBE WE'RE BEING
A LITTLE CRAZY.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.701
YOU KNOW, THINK ABOUT
HOW THAT WOULD GO.
WHAT WOULD WE EVEN SAY?

11:41.735 --> 11:43.836
DID DAD HAVE A THIRD FAMILY?

11:43.870 --> 11:45.838
WE DON'T HAVE ANY EVIDENCE
TO SUPPORT THAT,

11:45.871 --> 11:46.907
ESPECIALLY WITHOUT THE BOOK.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.808
WHICH HE'S HIDING FROM US.

11:48.841 --> 11:50.277
WELL, WE DON'T KNOW THAT,
EITHER.

11:50.309 --> 11:53.480
AND SINCE THEY'RE LEAVING
TONIGHT, I THINK MAYBE
THAT'S A SIGN.

11:53.712 --> 11:55.081
OH, WHAT KIND OF SIGN?

11:55.115 --> 11:57.783
A SIGN THAT WE SHOULD LET THIS
GO SO I CAN TAKE MY LIFE BACK.

11:57.817 --> 12:00.253
OKAY, JUST ONE GAME,
AND THEN WE'RE OUT OF HERE.

12:00.287 --> 12:02.422
-(phone vibrates)
-I HATE YOU, PAM.

12:02.456 --> 12:04.857
WHO'S PAM?

12:04.890 --> 12:07.860
PAM IS THE WINTER STORM THAT
JUST CAUSED OUR FLIGHT
TO BE CANCELED.

12:08.861 --> 12:11.898
YEAH, LOOKS LIKE WE'RE
STUCK HERE FOR ONE MORE NIGHT.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.966
GUESS WE'RE GOING TO PLAY
MORE THAN ONE GAME.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.873
WHAT WERE YOU SAYING
ABOUT SIGNS?

12:27.480 --> 12:29.916
YES! OKAY, GOOD. UM...

12:29.950 --> 12:32.786
OH, UH,  SWEET HOME ALABAMA.

12:32.818 --> 12:34.354
WILD.

12:34.386 --> 12:35.754
-BEAR BRYANT?
-TRUMAN CAPOTE.

12:35.788 --> 12:36.923
UM. NO, NO. REESE WITHERSPOON!

12:36.956 --> 12:38.825
YES! GOOD. OKAY, UM.

12:38.859 --> 12:39.926
(timer beeps)

12:39.960 --> 12:41.128
OKAY, STOP.

12:41.161 --> 12:43.897
THE SCORE IS TIED 15 TO 15.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.798
BETH, YOU'RE UP.

12:45.831 --> 12:47.100
ALL RIGHT.

12:48.534 --> 12:50.370
OKAY.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.538
OKAY, READY? OKAY, GO.

12:53.807 --> 12:54.975
UH, SURI'S MOM.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.243
OH, STEVE JOBS!

12:56.275 --> 12:58.010
-DAWSON.
-OH, KATIE HOLMES!

12:58.043 --> 12:59.980
(laughter)

13:00.013 --> 13:01.780
UH,  LOVE STORY. BAD BLOOD.

13:01.815 --> 13:03.283
-ALI MacGRAW!
-TAYLOR SWIFT.

13:03.316 --> 13:05.351
-YES. YES.
-(laughter)

13:05.384 --> 13:07.019
GENOVIA.

13:07.052 --> 13:09.355
-ANNE HATHAWAY?
-YAY!

13:09.389 --> 13:11.057
-BLANE.
-ANDREW McCARTHEY.

13:11.091 --> 13:13.225
-YES!
-(laughter)

13:13.259 --> 13:15.828
- PARTY OF FIVE.
-NEVE CAMPBELL?

13:15.861 --> 13:17.429
-MMH.
-MATTHEW FOX.

13:17.463 --> 13:19.265
-THAT'S SO FETCH!
-LACEY CHABERT!

13:19.298 --> 13:20.533
-YES!
-WHAT?

13:20.567 --> 13:23.302
-(laughter)
-AH, STOP!

13:23.336 --> 13:26.373
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT JUST HAPPENED.
THESE TWO ARE OF ONE MIND.

13:26.405 --> 13:29.208
CAN WE TRY SOMETHING
THAT ADULTS CAN PLAY?

13:29.241 --> 13:30.809
LIKE A BLUFFING GAME?

13:30.844 --> 13:33.279
WHERE YOU HAVE TO DECIDE IF
SOMEONE'S TELLING THE TRUTH?

13:33.312 --> 13:36.182
UH, WELL, I THINK SARA TOLD ME

13:36.216 --> 13:38.485
THAT EMMA TOOK
BALDERDASH  WITH HER TO SEDONA.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.086
YEP.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.489
THAT'S OKAY. I FEEL LIKE YOU
MIGHT HAVE AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.157
(chuckles)

13:44.191 --> 13:45.859
(chuckles)

13:46.860 --> 13:49.528
OR, UH, YOU KNOW,
WE COULD STICK TO  CELEBRITY,

13:49.562 --> 13:52.899
LET'S JUST TRY PICKING PEOPLE
NOT RIPPED FROM THE PAGES
OF  US WEEKLY.

13:52.932 --> 13:54.533
AND-- AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
SWITCH UP THE TEAMS.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.870
BETH AND BRENNA CAN NO LONGER
BE ON THE SAME SIDE.

13:56.903 --> 13:58.837
-NO!
-WHAT?

13:58.871 --> 14:01.441
-OH, COME ON.
-THAT IS NOT FAIR.

14:02.576 --> 14:06.580
(sighs) HOW 'BOUT
SHILOH JOLIE-PITT?

14:06.613 --> 14:09.448
OH, GOOD ONE. IS IT WEIRD
THAT I WANT TO BE SHILOH?

14:09.481 --> 14:10.482
A LITTLE BIT.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.118
THANK GOD I'M ON YOUR TEAM.

14:12.152 --> 14:14.019
I DON'T KNOW WHO
ANY OF THESE PEOPLE ARE.

14:14.053 --> 14:15.922
(laughs)

14:15.956 --> 14:18.124
GOOD TO SEE YOU TWO
GETTING ALONG.

14:20.159 --> 14:21.494
WHEN WEREN'T WE GETTING ALONG?

14:24.463 --> 14:28.567
UH, I-- I CAME BY HERE
YESTERDAY TO SEE YOU,

14:28.601 --> 14:31.605
AND I HAD A LITTLE CHAT
WITH MY FREE THERAPIST.

14:31.638 --> 14:34.206
-MOM.
-SHE WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

14:34.240 --> 14:37.509
LOOK, I KNOW I WAS ACTING ALL
BRITNEY SPEARS CIRCA 2007,

14:37.543 --> 14:39.346
AND I KNOW
IT'S BECAUSE YOU GUYS CARE.

14:39.379 --> 14:43.082
BUT TALKING ABOUT ME
BEHIND MY BACK DOESN'T MAKE ME
FEEL ANY LESS NUTS.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.152
JUST BELIEVE THAT I'M TRYING,
OKAY?

14:47.886 --> 14:49.054
George:
HEY, GUYS...

14:50.056 --> 14:51.991
AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT,

14:52.024 --> 14:54.159
I BOUGHT STUFF FOR S'MORES.

14:54.193 --> 14:56.196
OH YAY! (laughs)

15:00.466 --> 15:05.471
OKAY. OKAY, GIRLS. UH,
IF SOMEONE HAS SOMETHING THEY
WANT TO ASK ME,

15:05.504 --> 15:07.673
THEN GO AHEAD AND ASK.
WE'RE GOING TO BE
STUCK IN HERE, SO--

15:07.907 --> 15:09.609
DID DAD HAVE A THIRD FAMILY
IN BALTIMORE?

15:09.643 --> 15:12.245
-APRIL, I THOUGHT WE DECIDED--
-HE SAID I COULD ASK HIM
WHATEVER I WANTED,

15:12.278 --> 15:13.446
AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW.

15:14.447 --> 15:17.517
NO. NO, THERE WAS
NO THIRD FAMILY.

15:17.549 --> 15:19.318
THEN WHAT WAS HE DOING THERE?

15:20.586 --> 15:23.657
WELL, HE WAS A WRITER,
SO HE TRAVELED FOR RESEARCH
ALL THE TIME.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.658
REMEMBER, THIS BOOK
WASN'T SET IN BALTIMORE.

15:25.692 --> 15:28.294
WELL, MAYBE IT WAS FOR
A FUTURE BOOK. WHO KNOWS?

15:28.327 --> 15:30.697
NOW THAT YOU'RE
NOT RUSHING TO MAKE A FLIGHT,

15:30.929 --> 15:32.631
CAN I PLEASE TAKE A LOOK
AT THE MANUSCRIPT?

15:32.665 --> 15:35.000
IT'S BURIED IN MY LUGGAGE.
I'D REALLY HAVE TO DIG IT OUT.

15:35.034 --> 15:36.101
WE'VE GOT TIME.

15:36.135 --> 15:38.404
OKAY. YOU KNOW WHAT? ENOUGH.

15:38.437 --> 15:41.707
APRIL, I DON'T THINK THIS COULD
POSSIBLY BE GOOD FOR YOU GETTING
WORKED UP LIKE THIS.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.710
CAN WE PLEASE JUST
PLAY ANOTHER ROUND OF CELEBRITY?

15:43.942 --> 15:45.511
ACTUALLY, I'M GOING TO
SIT THIS ONE OUT.

15:45.544 --> 15:47.313
I HAVE TO TAKE MY MEDS ANYWAY.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.517
S'MORES?

15:50.549 --> 15:52.085
YES, PLEASE.

16:02.328 --> 16:04.496
-HEY.
-SORRY.

16:04.530 --> 16:06.633
IF YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO FILM THIS, I WON'T.

16:06.666 --> 16:10.370
OH, SURE. I MEAN, IF THEY DON'T
LET YOU IN AFTER SEEING YOUR

16:10.403 --> 16:13.139
DYING SISTER GIVE HERSELF CHEMO,
THEN THEY'RE EVIL.

16:13.173 --> 16:14.640
YOU'RE NOT DYING.

16:16.241 --> 16:17.677
WE'LL SEE.

16:17.711 --> 16:21.246
IT'S WEIRD. DEATH USED TO BE
MY GREATEST FEAR,

16:21.280 --> 16:22.615
BUT NOW...

16:25.018 --> 16:29.022
IT'S SUCH A REAL POSSIBILITY,
THAT IF I DON'T,
IT'S LIKE A BONUS.

16:30.023 --> 16:32.524
IMAGINE IF YOU
HADN'T FOUND OUT WHEN YOU DID.

16:32.558 --> 16:36.196
REMEMBER, GEORGE WAS
THE FIRST PERSON TO TELL YOU.

16:36.229 --> 16:38.630
-BREN--
-YOU BASICALLY
CALLED HIM A LIAR.

16:41.701 --> 16:44.504
THAT'S BECAUSE
I THINK HE'S LYING TO US.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.706
BRENNA, I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.
I DO.

16:46.740 --> 16:48.707
IT'S THE SAME WAY I FELT
WHEN I FOUND OUT ABOUT DAD.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.678
I LOVED HIM SO MUCH
THAT I WAS BLINDSIDED,

16:52.711 --> 16:55.581
AND I JUST WANT YOU TO PREPARE
YOURSELF FOR THAT WITH GEORGE.

16:59.719 --> 17:01.687
-CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SEC?
-HMM.

17:07.626 --> 17:09.762
SORRY I ASKED GEORGE
ABOUT THE OTHER FAMILY.

17:09.796 --> 17:12.132
-I JUST THOUGHT THAT--
-IT'S OKAY.

17:12.164 --> 17:14.666
AND I UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU THINK THAT,

17:14.701 --> 17:17.737
BUT I'M POSITIVE
IT'S NOT TRUE.

17:17.770 --> 17:20.105
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

17:34.721 --> 17:36.189
WHEN YOU WENT AWAY
TO COLLEGE,

17:37.156 --> 17:38.590
YOUR DAD BEGAN TO HAVE...

17:41.227 --> 17:43.328
WELL, A PROBLEM.

17:47.567 --> 17:48.601
HOW WAS YOUR NIGHT?

17:48.634 --> 17:50.202
GOOD.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.070
THE GIRLS AND I HAD
THE TURKEY MEATLOAF.

17:52.105 --> 17:53.173
THERE'S--

17:55.107 --> 17:57.343
THERE'S MORE IN THE FRIDGE,
IF YOU'RE HUNGRY.

18:01.114 --> 18:03.482
-HOW'S EDWIN?
-OH, HE DIDN'T SHOW.

18:03.516 --> 18:06.586
HE'S PROBABLY OFF
DOING SOME RESEARCH

18:06.618 --> 18:09.288
-WITH ANOTHER T.A.
-YOU WERE BY YOURSELF ALL NIGHT?

18:09.321 --> 18:10.656
NOT BY MYSELF.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.090
BARTENDER WAS GOOD COMPANY.

18:12.125 --> 18:14.294
HE WAS ON  JEOPARDY  ONCE.

18:14.326 --> 18:15.694
THOMAS.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.797
IT HELPS THE WRITING.
EVERY CONVERSATION
HELPS THE WRITING.

18:17.830 --> 18:19.465
I STUDY THE HUMAN CONDITION.

18:19.499 --> 18:20.834
I'M NOT BUYING THAT ANYMORE.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.404
HOW MANY DRINKS DID YOU HAVE?

18:29.843 --> 18:33.145
I KNOW I HAVE BEEN OVERINDULGING
A LITTLE BIT LATELY,

18:33.179 --> 18:35.147
-BUT I'M FINE.
-NO, YOU'RE NOT.

18:36.548 --> 18:39.384
YOU'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE.
YOU'RE SLURRING.
YOU'RE STUMBLING OVER THINGS.

18:41.820 --> 18:43.455
SOMETHING'S GOTTA CHANGE.

18:45.892 --> 18:47.594
YOU THINK DAD
WAS AN ALCOHOLIC?

18:47.626 --> 18:49.362
HE ADMITTED IT TO ME,

18:49.394 --> 18:51.730
AND I MADE HIM GO TO REHAB.

18:52.765 --> 18:54.400
HE FOUND A PLACE IN BALTIMORE.

18:55.768 --> 18:57.269
THAT'S WHY HE WAS THERE.

18:57.302 --> 18:59.638
NOT AS LONG AS I WANTED.
HE ONLY STAYED A WEEK.

19:02.674 --> 19:04.911
I DON'T THINK HE EVER GOT WELL
BEFORE HE DIED.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.680
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME THIS BEFORE?

19:07.713 --> 19:09.582
YOU KNOW YOUR DAD, HIS HUBRIS.

19:09.615 --> 19:13.353
HE-- HE'D HAD A PRETTY HARD
FALL FROM GRACE AS IT WAS,

19:13.385 --> 19:16.788
AND I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO RUIN
WHATEVER LAST SHRED OF...

19:16.823 --> 19:18.324
GOOD MEMORIES THAT WERE LEFT.

19:19.726 --> 19:21.894
WE CAN'T CHOOSE WHO WE LOVE,
BUT...

19:24.396 --> 19:26.865
WE CAN CHOOSE HOW WE RESPOND
TO THOSE PEOPLE

19:26.900 --> 19:29.402
WHEN THEY DO
SELF-DESTRUCTIVE THINGS.

19:29.434 --> 19:31.503
I USED TO THINK
I SHOULD PROTECT YOU

19:31.538 --> 19:33.272
FROM THE TRUTH ABOUT YOUR DAD,

19:33.306 --> 19:36.241
BUT IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
HEALTHY TO LET YOU KEEP HIM
ON A PEDESTAL

19:36.276 --> 19:38.744
AS SOME IDEAL MAN WHO COULD

19:38.778 --> 19:39.878
DO NO WRONG.

19:45.218 --> 19:47.420
SOMEONE ELSE
IS ON THAT PEDESTAL NOW.

19:47.452 --> 19:48.721
LEO.

19:48.755 --> 19:49.756
I KNOW, SWEETHEART.

19:51.790 --> 19:53.625
AND A FIRST LOVE
IS HARD TO TOP.

19:56.729 --> 19:57.797
ACTUALLY, I'M...

19:59.265 --> 20:01.366
NOT SURE THAT WAS
THE FIRST TIME I FELL IN LOVE.

20:04.770 --> 20:06.306
AND IT WON'T BE THE LAST.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.744
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

20:12.778 --> 20:13.913
(sigh) HOME.

20:13.946 --> 20:15.781
NOW? WHY?

20:15.815 --> 20:17.784
BECAUSE I'M GOING
STIR CRAZY HERE.

20:17.817 --> 20:20.420
HAVE YOU NOTICED THERE'S SOME
SUPER WEIRD ENERGY
IN THIS HOUSE TONIGHT?

20:20.452 --> 20:23.690
I NOTICE THERE'S A
WEIRD ENERGY IN THIS HOUSE

20:23.722 --> 20:25.357
PRETTY MUCH EVERY NIGHT.

20:25.391 --> 20:28.394
WELL, SINCE I'M NOT A PART OF
THIS FAMILY, I GET TO OPT OUT.

20:28.428 --> 20:29.695
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO GO?

20:29.729 --> 20:31.330
-YES.
-FINE.

20:31.364 --> 20:33.665
ALL RIGHT, UM.
IT'S REALLY BAD OUT THERE.

20:35.300 --> 20:36.736
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

20:48.548 --> 20:49.749
BY THE WAY, YOU'RE WRONG...

20:49.781 --> 20:52.684
ABOUT NOT BEING
A PART OF THIS FAMILY.

20:52.719 --> 20:54.252
I MEAN, YOU'RE HERE FOR

20:54.287 --> 20:59.258
BREAKFAST, LUNCH, DINNER,
CANCER, WEDDINGS, FUNERALS.

21:01.861 --> 21:03.630
-YOU'RE MY SISTER.
-(laughs)

21:03.663 --> 21:04.696
GET USED TO IT.

21:04.730 --> 21:06.699
(laughter)

21:06.732 --> 21:09.669
(sniffle) YOU ARE A GOOD EGG,
BRENNA CARVER,

21:09.701 --> 21:12.672
AND ALSO,
IMPRESSIVELY GOOD AT  CELEBRITY.

21:12.704 --> 21:13.806
-I KNOW.
-WE KILLED IT.

21:18.744 --> 21:19.979
DAD WAS AN ALCOHOLIC.

21:20.012 --> 21:21.381
WHAT?

21:21.413 --> 21:23.449
MOM JUST TOLD ME, THE REASON
HE WENT TO BALTIMORE

21:23.482 --> 21:26.051
WAS FOR A REHAB
HE DIDN'T EVEN FINISH.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.688
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, IT
PRETTY MUCH EXPLAINS EVERYTHING.

21:28.721 --> 21:31.557
IT DEFINITELY DOESN'T EXPLAIN
WHY GEORGE HAS BEEN LYING.

21:31.590 --> 21:34.693
MAYBE HE WAS JUST
TRYING TO PROTECT DAD,
LIKE HE ALWAYS DOES.

21:34.727 --> 21:37.829
WELL, IF THAT'S THE CASE, THEN
THE BOOK SHOULD BE IN HIS
SUITCASE LIKE HE SAID.

21:37.864 --> 21:39.365
LET'S GO LOOK.

21:40.666 --> 21:41.834
COME ON.

21:41.867 --> 21:43.301
WHAT ELSE IS THERE
TO DO IN HERE?

21:44.537 --> 21:46.405
AND WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR REPORTER SKILLS?

21:47.573 --> 21:49.409
IF THIS WAS A STORY,
NO WAY IN HELL

21:49.442 --> 21:51.009
THE OLD APRIL CARTER
WOULD HAVE DROPPED IT.

21:52.979 --> 21:55.714
...to give you
some perspective on this
potentially historic storm.

21:56.816 --> 22:00.053
- The low pressure area--
-THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT
THREE FEET OF SNOW.

22:00.086 --> 22:02.622
WE COULD BE
IN THIS HOUSE FOR A WHILE.

22:02.654 --> 22:04.457
(scoff) OOH.

22:05.791 --> 22:07.559
SUNNY AND 60 ONE DAY,

22:07.593 --> 22:09.561
FREAK BLIZZARD THE NEXT.

22:09.595 --> 22:10.896
WELCOME TO NEW ENGLAND, MAE.

22:12.397 --> 22:13.499
THANKS.

22:16.736 --> 22:18.770
WELL, I'M GLAD I
STOCKED THE FRIDGE,

22:18.805 --> 22:21.773
THOUGH I DON'T KNOW.
CAN THE FAMILY SURVIVE ON
HUMMUS AND S'MORES ALONE?

22:21.807 --> 22:23.675
OH, WELL, YOU KNOW,

22:23.710 --> 22:26.712
DURING A SNOW STORM, TEQUILA
DEFINITELY MOVES TO THE TOP
OF THE FOOD PYRAMID,

22:27.814 --> 22:28.748
OR THE BOTTOM.

22:28.780 --> 22:30.016
WHERE'D YOU FIND THAT?

22:30.048 --> 22:32.085
UH, IN THE
BACK OF THE SIDEBOARD.

22:32.117 --> 22:34.787
HOPE YOU DON'T MIND, SARA.
WE ARE TOTALLY OUT OF WINE.

22:34.820 --> 22:36.388
-NO, THAT'S FINE.
-OKAY.

22:36.422 --> 22:38.356
Sara: I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER
WHERE THAT BOTTLE CAME FROM.

22:38.391 --> 22:40.759
MAYBE A GIFT
FROM A LONG TIME AGO?

22:40.792 --> 22:42.528
IT IS A PRETTY BOTTLE, THOUGH.
WHAT IS IT?

22:42.561 --> 22:45.832
A VERY HIGH QUALITY  ANEJO
I HAVEN'T HAD IN A LONG TIME.

22:47.767 --> 22:51.002
TWO YEARS IN  LOS CHIVOS JALISCO
WITH DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS.

22:51.037 --> 22:52.371
WELL,

22:52.404 --> 22:54.073
SINCE IT'S DOCTOR APPROVED--

22:54.106 --> 22:56.541
AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE
GOING TO BE STUCK HERE FOR
WHO KNOWS HOW LONG.

22:56.576 --> 22:57.809
AH, WELL,
NONE FOR ME, THANKS.

22:57.844 --> 22:59.412
I'M GOOD.

22:59.444 --> 23:00.712
WE'RE OUT OF MARSHMALLOWS.

23:00.747 --> 23:01.847
George: ON IT.

23:04.983 --> 23:06.051
COUNT ME IN, PLEASE.

23:06.085 --> 23:07.487
OH, YAY!

23:08.921 --> 23:11.958
IS IT MY IMAGINATION OR
IS MAE A LITTLE PRICKLY WITH ME?

23:11.990 --> 23:13.893
OH, I WOULDN'T READ
TOO MUCH INTO IT.

23:13.925 --> 23:16.796
YOU KNOW HOW DOCTORS ARE.
ONE MINUTE THEY'RE
HEALING A PERSON,

23:16.828 --> 23:18.931
THE NEXT MINUTE,
THEY'RE MOODY AS HELL.

23:18.964 --> 23:21.867
HI, GEORGE. HI, SARA.

23:21.901 --> 23:24.103
(chuckles) HI, NATALIE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

23:24.136 --> 23:27.105
DOING? NOTHING.
JUST, YOU KNOW,
HANGING IN THE KITCH.

23:27.140 --> 23:29.174
Sara:
APRIL, WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE?

23:29.407 --> 23:32.878
HEY, WHY ARE ALL MY CLOTHES
LYING ALL OVER THE FLOOR?

23:34.780 --> 23:36.648
-WHERE'S THE BOOK, GEORGE?
-APRIL!

23:36.682 --> 23:39.085
YOU SAID YOU PACKED THE BOOK.
WHERE IS IT?

23:39.117 --> 23:42.454
Sara: GEORGE, JUST SHOW HER
THE BOOK SO WE CAN DROP THIS.

23:42.488 --> 23:44.123
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT YOU
WENT THROUGH MY LUGGAGE.

23:44.156 --> 23:45.892
BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T
BEING HONEST WITH US.

23:45.924 --> 23:47.692
(wind intensifies)

23:47.727 --> 23:50.829
OKAY, LISTEN TO ME.
I-- I GOT RID OF IT...

23:50.863 --> 23:52.832
FOR THE GOOD OF THIS FAMILY.
THERE'S NOTHING TRUTHFUL IN IT,

23:52.865 --> 23:54.700
-AND IT WAS MAKING
EVERYBODY CRAZY.
-(wind intensifies)

23:54.733 --> 23:56.434
-(scream)
-(gasp)

23:57.804 --> 23:58.837
MAE!

24:04.743 --> 24:06.546
YOU REALLY NEED STITCHES.

24:06.578 --> 24:07.747
I DON'T NEED STITCHES.

24:07.779 --> 24:09.981
PRETTY SURE YOU
NICKED YOUR RADIAL NERVE.

24:10.016 --> 24:13.451
IF THERE'S A NICK ON MY NERVE,
IT'S BECAUSE OF YOUR
TWEEZER WORK.

24:13.486 --> 24:15.086
NOW I SEE WHY YOU
DIDN'T GO INTO SURGERY.

24:15.121 --> 24:16.788
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
WANT SOME WATER.

24:16.823 --> 24:18.790
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
I CAN DO?

24:18.825 --> 24:20.826
YES, PLEASE TURN UP
THE ANESTHESIA.

24:22.561 --> 24:25.230
-STOP CLENCHING YOUR FIST.
-STOP POKING IN THE WRONG PLACE.

24:25.463 --> 24:26.965
STOP BACKSEAT DRIVING.

24:26.999 --> 24:29.836
ISN'T THERE A SAYING THAT
DOCTORS ARE, LIKE,
THE HARDEST PATIENTS?

24:29.868 --> 24:33.538
NO, I THINK IT'S JUST
WHEN THE OTHER DOCTOR
ISN'T INSTILLING TRUST.

24:33.573 --> 24:36.843
WELL, MAYBE IT'S JUST THAT
THE FIRST DOCTOR DOESN'T KNOW
HOW TO TRUST.

24:40.947 --> 24:41.980
AH, AH, AH. I'LL DO IT.

24:43.816 --> 24:44.916
THANK YOU.

24:44.951 --> 24:46.853
THANK YOU.
I-- I'M GOING TO BED.

24:53.859 --> 24:54.759
GOOD NIGHT.

24:57.563 --> 24:59.699
(sigh) SORRY
YOU HAD TO SEE THAT.

24:59.731 --> 25:01.601
NO, NO. NOT AT ALL.

25:01.634 --> 25:02.667
I MEAN,
IT JUST SEEMED LIKE...

25:03.836 --> 25:05.605
YOU KNOW, COUPLE BANTER.

25:06.771 --> 25:08.708
HMM, NOT EXACTLY.

25:08.740 --> 25:10.009
THINGS WITH US
AREN'T WORKING OUT.

25:14.180 --> 25:15.882
AND I THOUGHT YOU GOING THROUGH
YOUR UNCLE'S LUGGAGE

25:15.914 --> 25:17.817
WAS GOING TO BE THE
HIGHLIGHT OF THE EVENING.

25:19.085 --> 25:21.953
I KNOW I'M PROBABLY
COMPLETELY OBSESSING
ABOUT THIS STUFF,

25:21.988 --> 25:23.689
AND HONESTLY,

25:23.722 --> 25:25.657
I DON'T BLAME YOU
IF YOU JUST WANNA

25:25.691 --> 25:28.728
DELETE MY NUMBER FROM YOUR PHONE
AND THROW IN THE TOWEL.

25:31.696 --> 25:34.032
YOU KNOW, IT SEEMS LIKE
FOREVER SINCE YOU TOLD ME
ABOUT YOUR LIFE.

25:36.167 --> 25:37.903
IT WAS KIND OF INTENTIONAL,

25:39.038 --> 25:41.941
'CAUSE MY LIFE'S
PRETTY GOOD THESE DAYS.

25:42.942 --> 25:44.609
TELL ME MORE.

25:44.644 --> 25:49.882
UM, THINGS ARE GETTING
A LITTLE SERIOUS WITH
ME AND JOSH.

25:49.915 --> 25:51.683
PRETTY SURE WE'RE
GOING TO BE A THING.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.986
WHAT? YOU
NEVER TALK LIKE THIS.

25:54.019 --> 25:55.288
I KNOW.

25:55.320 --> 25:56.788
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

25:57.789 --> 25:59.892
HOW COULD I? I MEAN,

25:59.925 --> 26:01.760
YOU JUST LOST LEO.

26:04.262 --> 26:07.066
THAT DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T WANT
YOU TO FIND SOMEONE TO
FALL IN LOVE WITH.

26:07.098 --> 26:08.867
I DIDN'T SAY I LOVED HIM.

26:10.603 --> 26:11.770
YOU PRE-LOVE HIM.

26:11.804 --> 26:14.606
-MAYBE. OH MY GOD.
-(laughs)

26:15.607 --> 26:16.675
APE.

26:18.778 --> 26:20.846
OH, HEY, YOU CAN GO.
I GOT THIS.

26:34.125 --> 26:37.229
Natalie: IF THERE'S NOTHING IN
THE BOOK, THEN WHY DID HE
GET RID OF IT?

26:37.262 --> 26:39.265
April: I KNOW. THERE WAS
SOMETHING IN THERE.

26:40.665 --> 26:42.233
BET WE HAVE A BROTHER.

26:42.268 --> 26:44.236
I ALWAYS WANTED A BROTHER.

26:44.269 --> 26:46.705
NOT LIKE THIS, OBVIOUSLY.

26:47.772 --> 26:50.643
I KIND OF BELIEVED GEORGE
WHEN HE SAID THERE
WEREN'T ANY MORE OF US.

26:50.675 --> 26:53.878
MAYBE DAD KILLED SOMEONE?

26:53.913 --> 26:55.748
I DON'T THINK HE COULD
IF HE TRIED.

26:55.780 --> 26:57.817
WHAT IF DAD WAS GAY?

26:57.849 --> 27:00.152
AND GEORGE WENT TO THESE
EXTREMES TO COVER IT UP?

27:00.185 --> 27:01.753
I MEAN, WHAT YEAR IS IT?

27:02.788 --> 27:04.056
WHAT IF...

27:05.891 --> 27:09.194
MOM AND GEORGE
WANTED TO HAVE AN AFFAIR?

27:09.228 --> 27:12.198
WHAT? ARE YOU TRYING TO
STIR UP DRAMA FOR YOUR MOVIE?

27:12.230 --> 27:15.901
NO. THERE'S NO CAMERA HERE,
JUST A QUESTION.

27:16.969 --> 27:20.772
MOM AND GEORGE? BECAUSE THEY
DATED BEFORE MOM AND DAD?

27:20.806 --> 27:22.307
SARA AND GEORGE DATED?

27:22.340 --> 27:24.876
YEAH, AND...

27:26.846 --> 27:29.015
THEY DATED, LIKE
A FEW MONTHS AGO.

27:29.048 --> 27:32.884
-WHAT?
-AND GEORGE AND MAE
JUST BROKE UP.

27:32.917 --> 27:36.221
MAYBE MAE IS PICKING UP
ON SOMETHING BETWEEN THEM?

27:39.657 --> 27:41.861
DO YOU THINK THEY HOOKED UP
WHILE SARA WAS MARRIED?

27:43.929 --> 27:45.431
GOD KNOWS DAD WAS
OUT OF TOWN ENOUGH.

27:48.933 --> 27:49.801
YOU GUYS...

27:51.302 --> 27:54.039
THE FIRST LINE OF DAD'S BOOK
IS THE MAIN CHARACTER
SAYING THAT...

27:54.073 --> 27:55.907
HE'S PLANNING HIS OWN DEATH.

27:57.076 --> 27:58.711
WHAT IF THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED?

28:00.112 --> 28:02.114
WHAT IF DAD KILLED HIMSELF

28:02.147 --> 28:05.151
BECAUSE HE FOUND OUT ABOUT AN
AFFAIR BETWEEN MOM AND GEORGE?

28:07.752 --> 28:10.756
NO. WAIT, ACTUALLY, THAT'S
IMPOSSIBLE. GEORGE WAS
DRIVING THE CAR.

28:10.789 --> 28:12.825
UNLESS HE WASN'T.

28:12.857 --> 28:15.060
BUT THEN THE ONLY WAY THE
POLICE REPORT WOULD SAY THAT

28:15.094 --> 28:17.997
GEORGE WAS DRIVING,
IS IF GEORGE LIED.

28:24.869 --> 28:26.872
Sara: BLANKETS, BLANKETS.

28:26.905 --> 28:29.875
WHERE ARE YOU, BLANKETS?

28:29.909 --> 28:31.277
George: "WE'RE HIDING
FROM YOU, BECAUSE

28:31.309 --> 28:33.913
"YOU'RE ADDRESSING US BY NAME,
AND IT'S A LITTLE CREEPY."

28:33.945 --> 28:35.346
-(laughs)
-"WE USED TO LIKE IT."

28:35.381 --> 28:37.715
-OKAY.
-OKAY.

28:38.817 --> 28:40.152
I GOT IT.
THANK YOU.

28:41.453 --> 28:43.355
HEY...

28:43.388 --> 28:45.958
I'M SORRY ABOUT YOU AND MAE.

28:45.990 --> 28:48.727
I'M A LITTLE SURPRISED.
IT SEEMED LIKE THINGS
WERE GOING WELL.

28:48.760 --> 28:50.762
WELL, UH,
I THOUGHT THEY WERE,

28:50.796 --> 28:53.098
BUT YOU KNOW HOW IT IS
WHEN THERE'S SO MUCH DISTANCE,

28:53.132 --> 28:57.001
AND JUST TWO
INSANELY DEMANDING CAREERS.

28:57.036 --> 29:00.873
YEAH. I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
WANTED THAT KIND OF
RELATIONSHIP, THOUGH.

29:00.905 --> 29:04.809
I MEAN, IT WORKED IN THEORY,
RATHER THAN IN PRACTICE.

29:04.844 --> 29:07.813
UM, THIS WAS SORT OF OUR ATTEMPT
TO HAVE A LAST CONVERSATION

29:07.846 --> 29:10.849
ABOUT WHETHER TO MAKE IT WORK,
AND THAT'S WHY SHE
CAME UP FROM NEW YORK,

29:10.883 --> 29:14.752
BUT SOMETIMES IF IT'S BROKEN,
YOU GOTTA STOP TRYING TO FIX IT.

29:16.387 --> 29:18.790
WELL, I'LL LET HER KNOW,
THAT...

29:18.824 --> 29:21.861
SHE'S GOT A FRIEND IF SHE
EVER NEEDS ONE WHEN SHE'S
IN BOSTON.

29:21.894 --> 29:23.162
YEAH, I WOULDN'T DO THAT.

29:23.194 --> 29:26.097
SHE HAS SOME
COMPLICATED FEELINGS ABOUT YOU.

29:27.967 --> 29:29.868
(sighs) ME?

29:29.902 --> 29:32.938
YOU AND I WERE OVER
BEFORE YOU MET HER.

29:32.971 --> 29:34.940
WELL, SHE COULD
NEVER GET OVER IT.

29:44.383 --> 29:46.919
OH! (laughs)

29:46.951 --> 29:49.954
NO, NO. (laughs)

29:49.989 --> 29:51.423
BETH, I THINK
THAT ONE'S A GONER.

29:51.457 --> 29:53.858
NO. NO WAY.
I LIKE THEM WELL DONE.

29:54.859 --> 29:57.796
-BLEH, OH.
-(chuckles)

29:57.829 --> 30:00.231
-MAYBE NOT THAT WELL DONE.
-(laughs)

30:00.266 --> 30:01.866
April: WOW.

30:01.901 --> 30:03.368
WHAT'D I MISS?

30:03.402 --> 30:06.438
SHE'S BEEN PUTTING ON
QUITE THE SHOW FOR US DOWN HERE.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.273
I BLAME THE TEQUILA.

30:08.307 --> 30:09.974
AH, ALL OF IT?

30:11.343 --> 30:13.311
HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
THIS DRUNKIE IN A WHILE.

30:13.345 --> 30:15.213
I'M LIKE A FUN DRUNK, RIGHT?

30:15.247 --> 30:17.849
YES, YOU ARE A
SUPER FUN DRUNK.

30:17.883 --> 30:19.551
BUT WHEN YOU GET THIS DRUNK,
YOU USUALLY

30:19.585 --> 30:21.819
(whispers)
DRUNK DIAL YOUR EXES.

30:21.854 --> 30:24.355
OH, YEAH I DO. I DO.

30:24.390 --> 30:27.358
AND NOW THAT YOUR IN,
YOU KNOW, PRE-LOVE--

30:27.393 --> 30:29.494
YES. YES.

30:32.597 --> 30:35.334
-I AM IN PRE-LOVE.
-(chuckles)

30:35.366 --> 30:39.904
SO I MUST PUT MYSELF TO BED
BEFORE I SABOTAGE
MY OWN HAPPINESS.

30:39.939 --> 30:43.142
GOOD NIGHT.
FAREWELL, LOVED ONES.

30:43.174 --> 30:45.477
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

30:45.510 --> 30:47.613
-GOOD NIGHT, BETH.
-BEAUTIFUL.

30:47.846 --> 30:50.048
(chuckling)

30:54.118 --> 30:55.988
OKAY.

30:56.020 --> 30:57.589
THIS FAMILY NEEDS TO TALK.

30:59.525 --> 31:00.960
THERE ARE SOME
RUMORS GOING AROUND,

31:00.992 --> 31:02.627
AND I THINK IT'S TIME
WE FIND OUT THE TRUTH.

31:03.895 --> 31:05.096
I THINK WE ALREADY
KNOW THE TRUTH.

31:12.070 --> 31:13.638
UH, LAY IT ON ME.

31:15.507 --> 31:18.009
WELL, WE KNOW YOU
DESTROYED A BOOK

31:18.042 --> 31:20.578
THAT BEGAN WITH A LINE ABOUT
A MAN PLANNING HIS OWN DEATH.

31:20.613 --> 31:22.513
Sara: APRIL, YOUR FATHER
WAS A NOVELIST.

31:22.548 --> 31:24.316
HE WROTE FICTION.

31:24.349 --> 31:25.517
IS THAT TRUE?

31:25.550 --> 31:27.553
WAS IT FICTION, GEORGE?

31:27.586 --> 31:29.355
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS.

31:29.387 --> 31:32.625
RIGHT. NOTHING TRUTHFUL? LIES.

31:32.657 --> 31:34.326
LIKE WHAT YOU AND SARA
HAVE GOING ON?

31:35.627 --> 31:37.930
April: MOM, HAVE YOU AND GEORGE
DATED SINCE DAD DIED?

31:37.962 --> 31:41.500
WELL, YES, BUT WHAT DOES THAT
HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING?

31:41.532 --> 31:43.035
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

31:43.067 --> 31:44.470
YOU HAD ENOUGH ON YOUR PLATE.

31:44.502 --> 31:45.671
AND NOW?

31:45.903 --> 31:48.273
WHAT ARE THE TWO OF YOU
HIDING FROM US NOW?

31:50.308 --> 31:54.012
I-- I'M TRYING TO
PROTECT ALL OF YOU.

31:54.046 --> 31:55.447
CAN WE JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT?

31:55.480 --> 31:57.583
PROTECT US FROM WHAT?

31:57.615 --> 32:00.685
WERE YOU TOGETHER WITH GEORGE
WHEN YOU WERE MARRIED TO DAD?

32:00.919 --> 32:03.388
NO! NO!

32:03.422 --> 32:04.690
April: PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.392
WE ALL KNOW THAT DAD DID,

32:06.424 --> 32:09.094
AND IF, YOU KNOW,
YOU CHEATED BACK,

32:09.127 --> 32:12.131
HOW COULD YOU HAVE POSSIBLY
KNOWN THAT HE WOULD
WANT TO END HIS LIFE?

32:12.163 --> 32:15.968
END HIS LIFE?
WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM?

32:16.000 --> 32:17.568
MOM...

32:18.936 --> 32:22.607
WE THINK THAT DAD KILLED
HIMSELF, AND GEORGE
COVERED IT UP.

32:22.641 --> 32:24.643
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU--
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

32:24.676 --> 32:26.478
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
MY BROTHER'S DEATH

32:26.511 --> 32:29.580
LIKE IT WAS A SOAP OPERA,
WHEN REALLY IT WAS...

32:31.383 --> 32:32.718
IT WAS TRAGIC.

32:34.118 --> 32:36.288
YES, THOMAS...

32:38.257 --> 32:40.326
DID WANT TO END HIS LIFE,

32:41.326 --> 32:43.028
BUT NOT BECAUSE
WE WERE HAVING AN AFFAIR.

32:45.197 --> 32:46.464
BECAUSE HE WAS SICK.

32:48.634 --> 32:50.169
HE WAS DYING.

32:53.638 --> 32:54.673
SO, APRIL'S IN NEW YORK, HUH?

32:54.707 --> 32:56.674
-SHE LOVES IT.
-HUH.

32:56.709 --> 32:58.576
HEY.

32:58.609 --> 33:00.011
DAMN IT.

33:02.013 --> 33:04.016
THOSE TWITCHES LOOK LIKE
THEY'RE GETTING WORSE.

33:06.018 --> 33:07.519
THEY'RE NOT TWITCHES.

33:07.553 --> 33:10.521
WELL, IT'S BEEN A FEW MONTHS.
WE SHOULD CHECK YOUR--

33:10.556 --> 33:15.059
YOUR THYROID. RULE OUT
ANY INFECTION OR A MINOR STROKE.

33:16.327 --> 33:17.429
HAVE YOU TALKED TO SARA?

33:17.462 --> 33:18.564
NO.

33:20.132 --> 33:22.401
WELL, TOMMY, THIS COULD BE...
(clears throat) SERIOUS.

33:22.433 --> 33:23.769
IT IS SERIOUS,

33:25.304 --> 33:27.673
AND MY SYMPTOMS ARE OBVIOUSLY
GETTING IMPOSSIBLE TO HIDE.

33:27.705 --> 33:29.141
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

33:32.744 --> 33:35.381
WELL, IT TURNS OUT LOU GEHRIG
AND I HAVE A LOT MORE IN COMMON

33:35.413 --> 33:36.781
THAN OUR LOVE OF BASEBALL.

33:38.282 --> 33:40.719
(sighs) A.L.S. ARE YOU SAYING,
THAT YOU HAVE--

33:40.752 --> 33:42.253
YES.

33:42.287 --> 33:43.489
I HAVE A.L.S.

33:51.697 --> 33:52.765
YEAH, BUT THAT'S...

33:52.798 --> 33:53.798
INCURABLE.

33:55.032 --> 33:56.468
THERE'S ONLY ONE OUTCOME...

33:58.302 --> 33:59.505
AND IT'S COMING.

34:01.173 --> 34:02.607
WHICH IS WHY I NEED YOUR HELP.

34:04.442 --> 34:05.676
I WANT YOU TO HELP ME DIE.

34:05.711 --> 34:08.579
DON'T TALK LIKE THAT.
YOU CAN...

34:09.681 --> 34:12.617
STILL LIVE. YOU CAN HAVE
A PRODUCTIVE LIFE.

34:12.650 --> 34:15.286
AND IF I DON'T, YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT LOOKS LIKE, I'M NOT GONNA
DIE LIKE THAT.

34:17.322 --> 34:19.757
GEORGE, YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE
I CAN COUNT ON.

34:19.791 --> 34:21.193
PLEASE.

34:21.226 --> 34:22.494
YOU NEED TO TALK TO SARA.

34:22.527 --> 34:24.630
NO. I'M NOT GONNA SAY
ANYTHING TO HER OR THE GIRLS.

34:24.663 --> 34:27.099
THEY'LL JUST TRY TO
TALK ME OUT OF IT. THIS WAY...

34:28.634 --> 34:30.802
I CAN GO OUT WITH
SOME DIGNITY INTACT.

34:30.835 --> 34:32.737
DIGNITY? SCREW YOUR DIGNITY.

34:33.838 --> 34:35.773
YOUR CHILDREN NEED YOU.
YOUR WIFE NEEDS YOU...

34:37.543 --> 34:41.847
IF ONLY FOR A-- A FINITE TIME.
HOW COULD YOU LEAVE THEM
BEFORE YOU HAVE TO?

34:42.079 --> 34:44.282
IF NOT FOR YOURSELF,
YOU STAY HERE.

34:44.315 --> 34:45.583
YOU STAY WITH THEM...

34:47.219 --> 34:48.420
EVERY SECOND YOU HAVE.

34:49.721 --> 34:50.755
(voice breaking)
DO YOU HEAR ME?

35:01.365 --> 35:02.768
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

35:02.800 --> 35:05.170
HE WASN'T AN ALCOHOLIC, SARA.

35:05.204 --> 35:07.706
HE WENT TO REHAB IN BALTIMORE.

35:07.739 --> 35:11.210
TO SEE A SPECIALIST
AT JOHNS HOPKINS...

35:12.277 --> 35:13.711
WHERE HE ACCEPTED...

35:14.746 --> 35:16.849
HOW DEBILITATING
HIS DISEASE WAS.

35:18.717 --> 35:20.284
IT IS NO WAY TO DIE.

35:23.722 --> 35:24.755
AND STILL...

35:26.492 --> 35:28.594
HE WAS TELLING ME
THAT HE DIDN'T WANT TO
SUFFER THROUGH THAT.

35:28.626 --> 35:32.130
I THOUGHT I'D--
I'D TALKED HIM OUT OF IT.

35:32.164 --> 35:33.331
WHAT HAPPENED?

35:33.364 --> 35:34.800
WELL, IT WAS RIGHT BEFORE HIS
55th BIRTHDAY,

35:34.833 --> 35:37.735
AND HE INVITED ME...

35:37.768 --> 35:39.838
DOWN TO FLORIDA FOR SOME
GOLFING AND...

35:40.873 --> 35:42.240
FISHING TO CELEBRATE.

35:42.273 --> 35:45.177
NATALIE PROBABLY REMEMBERS
SOME OF THIS.

35:45.210 --> 35:51.215
AND, UH-- AND WHEN I ARRIVED,
HE AGAIN PLEADED WITH ME
TO HELP HIM...

35:52.617 --> 35:53.751
AND NOBODY COULD KNOW.

35:55.420 --> 35:58.556
HIS INSURANCE POLICY WAS
EXPIRING WHEN HE WAS 55,

35:58.590 --> 36:00.759
SO HE HAD TO DO IT
BEFORE HIS BIRTHDAY.

36:01.927 --> 36:04.429
OTHERWISE HE'D HAVE TO RENEW,

36:05.731 --> 36:08.467
AND THEN ANY PHYSICAL HE
WOULD TAKE WOULD REVEAL
HOW SICK HE WAS,

36:09.501 --> 36:11.769
AND HE WANTED ALL OF YOU
TO BE TAKEN CARE OF.

36:11.802 --> 36:13.739
AND ALL HE NEEDED WAS MY HELP.

36:14.706 --> 36:15.907
YOU...

36:17.809 --> 36:19.811
YOU HELPED HIM KILL HIMSELF?

36:19.844 --> 36:21.612
George: APRIL...

36:21.646 --> 36:23.916
I PROMISE YOU, THERE WILL BE
NO MORE SECRETS LEFT...

36:25.851 --> 36:27.351
WHEN I STOP TALKING, OKAY?

36:30.889 --> 36:32.356
I DIDN'T AGREE WITH HIS PLAN.

36:33.891 --> 36:36.260
WE FOUGHT ABOUT IT,

36:36.295 --> 36:38.496
BUT MY GOD, HE WAS--
HE WAS DETERMINED.

36:40.865 --> 36:43.802
HE HOPPED IN HIS CAR,
AND-- AND SPED OFF,

36:43.835 --> 36:45.503
AND I GOT IN MY RENTAL
AND I FOLLOWED HIM,

36:45.536 --> 36:47.204
'CAUSE I KNEW.
I KNEW WHAT HE WAS--

36:50.775 --> 36:53.411
I TRIED TO GET HIM
TO PULL OVER.

36:53.445 --> 36:55.746
WE WERE RACING IN THIS--

36:55.780 --> 36:59.318
UGH, THIS EMPTY, OPEN STREET
A FEW MILES OUTSIDE OF KEY WEST.

37:02.353 --> 37:04.255
WE'RE DRIVING ALONG, AND...

37:06.224 --> 37:07.726
HE LOOKED OVER TO ME...

37:10.661 --> 37:16.668
(exhales shakily)
AND HE GUNNED THE ACCELERATOR,

37:16.702 --> 37:19.737
AND I WATCHED HIM AS HE
SWERVED HEAD ON INTO A TREE.

37:21.873 --> 37:24.443
AND, UH, I STOPPED...

37:25.744 --> 37:27.713
RAN OVER TO HIM
AND HE WAS, UH--

37:30.514 --> 37:31.817
I MEAN, HE WAS--

37:35.820 --> 37:37.489
(crying) YOU KNOW,
MY BROTHER WAS ALL--

37:40.759 --> 37:43.929
HE WAS BROKEN. HE WAS BROKEN,
AND HE WAS BLEEDING,
AND HE WAS--

37:43.961 --> 37:45.597
HE WAS HURT PRETTY BAD.

37:45.630 --> 37:46.931
BUT HE WAS STILL ALIVE.

37:48.500 --> 37:49.668
BARELY.

37:49.701 --> 37:50.735
WHAT DID YOU DO?

37:52.903 --> 37:54.373
I DID NOTHING.

37:56.608 --> 37:57.775
I SAT THERE...

37:58.909 --> 38:01.012
AND I HELD ONTO HIM

38:01.045 --> 38:02.514
UNTIL THE END.

38:03.748 --> 38:06.451
BUT THE POLICE SAID--

38:06.485 --> 38:08.719
I HAD TO MAKE
ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT

38:08.753 --> 38:10.856
IT LOOKED LIKE
JUST AN ACCIDENT.

38:11.789 --> 38:13.557
SO I MOVED HIS BODY...

38:14.659 --> 38:16.427
INTO THE PASSENGER SEAT

38:16.460 --> 38:18.597
AND I TOOK A-- A CROWBAR
OR SOMETHING

38:18.630 --> 38:21.599
AND I SMASHED THE GLASS
ON THE PASSENGER SIDE...

38:23.001 --> 38:28.072
AND I DRAGGED MY HAND, MY ARMS,
EVEN MY FACE IN THE GRAVEL.

38:30.509 --> 38:32.577
AND I HID MY RENTAL CAR

38:32.610 --> 38:35.614
AND I REPORTED THE ACCIDENT WITH
MYSELF AS THE DRIVER.

38:36.947 --> 38:38.315
AND...

38:39.784 --> 38:41.786
I SPENT THE LAST YEARS

38:41.820 --> 38:43.822
TRYING-- TRYING TO
PUT THIS BEHIND ME.

38:46.090 --> 38:49.628
WHY DID YOU
DO ALL THIS FOR HIM?

38:49.661 --> 38:52.063
WHY DID YOU LIE FOR HIM
ALL THESE YEARS?

38:54.733 --> 38:56.568
HE'S MY BIG BROTHER.

38:56.601 --> 38:58.402
I'D DO ANYTHING FOR HIM.

38:59.771 --> 39:02.440
I KNOW IT'S NOT LOGICAL,

39:02.474 --> 39:05.376
BUT IT'S THE TRUTH.

39:06.577 --> 39:07.913
I'M SORRY.

39:11.615 --> 39:13.851
WHAT YOU DID WAS
BASICALLY MURDER.

39:13.885 --> 39:17.688
WELL, SOME WOULD SAY
THAT I ASSISTED...

39:19.557 --> 39:23.394
WITH SOMETHING THAT HE WANTED,
BUT YEAH-- YEAH, THE LAW SAYS
IT'S MURDER.

39:24.795 --> 39:26.097
COULD YOU GO TO PRISON?

39:33.472 --> 39:34.739
YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD US.

39:36.775 --> 39:38.376
IT'S BETTER THAT
YOU DIDN'T KNOW.

39:38.409 --> 39:40.077
BECAUSE IF THE TRUTH
EVER CAME OUT,

39:40.112 --> 39:41.913
THEN THE INSURANCE MONEY

39:41.947 --> 39:44.815
THAT THOMAS WAS SO ADAMANT
YOU RECEIVE WOULD BE GONE.

39:44.849 --> 39:47.885
THE MONEY FOR THIS HOUSE,
FOR MEDICAL CARE.

39:48.920 --> 39:50.422
WE NEVER GOT ANY OF THAT MONEY.

39:52.891 --> 39:54.159
WHY IS THAT?

39:55.626 --> 39:56.795
I DON'T KNOW.

39:58.764 --> 40:01.932
I NEVER WANTED
ANY OF YOU TO FIND OUT.

40:04.135 --> 40:08.139
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN CARRYING THIS
SECRET FOR SO LONG...

40:11.809 --> 40:13.478
AND NOW IT'S YOUR SECRET
TO CARRY, TOO.

40:19.851 --> 40:24.822

41:24.782 --> 41:27.885
LAST NIGHT WAS INSANE.

41:27.918 --> 41:30.621
CAN'T BELIEVE I GOT WASTED
IN FRONT OF YOUR MOM AND UNCLE.

41:30.655 --> 41:33.657
A LOT OF THINGS HAPPENED
LAST NIGHT THAT I CAN'T BELIEVE.

41:33.692 --> 41:35.159
I'm glad you
made it home safely.

41:37.996 --> 41:39.130
HEY, WHAT'S WRONG?

41:43.235 --> 41:46.003

41:54.980 --> 41:58.182
(end theme plays)
