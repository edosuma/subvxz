00:09.879 --> 00:11.446
How do you feel?

00:11.489 --> 00:13.883
Good.

00:13.926 --> 00:17.147
Why?

00:17.191 --> 00:19.367
Because I'm in control.

00:21.760 --> 00:24.937
How long will it last?

00:24.981 --> 00:28.637
As long as I want it to.

00:30.900 --> 00:33.468
[ringtone playing]Oh.

00:33.511 --> 00:35.731
Sorry. I thought
I'd turned it off.

00:35.774 --> 00:37.385
The world calls.

00:37.428 --> 00:39.256
So is he here?

00:39.300 --> 00:40.779
MAIA:
Yes, his flight was delayed,

00:40.823 --> 00:42.346
but we're on our way to you
right now.No, I'm not

00:42.390 --> 00:43.217
at the office,
take him to court.

00:43.260 --> 00:45.132
What about witness prep?

00:45.175 --> 00:47.308
Do it on the way.Me?

00:47.351 --> 00:50.180
Yes. You know the case,
and there's no time.

00:50.224 --> 00:51.877
He'll go right on the stand
when he gets there.

00:51.921 --> 00:53.227
AVI:
Sure, he is shit.

00:55.490 --> 00:58.058
Oh, my fucking God,
you're making my head hurt.

00:58.101 --> 01:00.103
MAIA: Avi, wait, we
need to witness prep.

01:00.147 --> 01:01.539
No, we need to argue.No.

01:01.583 --> 01:03.063
You need to let Jay drive,

01:03.106 --> 01:05.195
and you and I need
to witness prep right now.

01:05.239 --> 01:06.892
How far are we from court?30 minutes.

01:06.936 --> 01:08.155
Can we go any faster?

01:08.198 --> 01:10.113
If you want us
to get pulled over, yes.

01:10.157 --> 01:12.507
Julius Cain, he is
one of our partners,

01:12.550 --> 01:13.986
he's gonna be
questioning you.

01:14.030 --> 01:17.381
Now, he will ask for
your name and occupation.

01:17.425 --> 01:18.817
[man singing in Spanish

01:18.861 --> 01:20.254
And you'll answer?

01:20.297 --> 01:22.647
With my name and occupation.

01:22.691 --> 01:24.475
Which are?

01:24.519 --> 01:25.824
[scoffs]
Are we afraid I'll forget it?

01:25.868 --> 01:27.130
Avi, I need
to see how you are

01:27.174 --> 01:27.957
on the stand.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.176
Avi Epps,

01:29.219 --> 01:31.830
I organize Birthright tours
in Israel.

01:31.874 --> 01:34.833
The defendant has been accused
of using Birthright money

01:34.877 --> 01:36.922
to bribe foreign officials.

01:36.966 --> 01:38.620
Now, do you know
this not to be true?

01:38.663 --> 01:40.926
I do... uh, know this
not to be true.

01:40.970 --> 01:42.058
Good.She's an awful woman,

01:42.102 --> 01:43.146
but she's not corrupt.

01:43.190 --> 01:44.626
No, no, no, you can't say that.

01:44.669 --> 01:45.801
Why? It's true.JAY: You're fucking
kidding me.

01:45.844 --> 01:47.237
No, it is.

02:07.170 --> 02:08.911
We're just running
a bit late, Officer.

02:08.954 --> 02:10.391
For?
Court.

02:10.434 --> 02:13.785
We work at Reddick, Boseman

02:13.829 --> 02:16.136
And you are?Hello, American police officer.

02:16.179 --> 02:17.485
MAIA:
He's scheduled to testify

02:17.528 --> 02:20.140
in federal court,
and we are, like I say,

02:20.183 --> 02:21.619
running a little bit late.

02:21.663 --> 02:23.099
You asking us to hurry?MAIA: Uh, no.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.579
I'm just sharing information.

02:24.622 --> 02:26.450
What's in the bag?

02:26.494 --> 02:27.799
AVI: I carry it
with me on the plane.

02:27.843 --> 02:29.149
I asked you
what's inside it,

02:29.192 --> 02:30.367
not how it got here.

02:30.411 --> 02:31.890
Please step out of the car.MAIA: Officer,

02:31.934 --> 02:34.371
just out of curiosity,
why were we pulled over?

02:34.415 --> 02:36.112
I need you all out of the car,
that's why you were pulled over.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.374
OFFICER:
Come on.
Maia, stop.

02:37.418 --> 02:38.506
Let's go.
OFFICER:
Any weapons in the bag?

02:38.549 --> 02:39.724
Anything
that'll stick...

responsibility.

02:45.991 --> 02:47.210
This is more bullshit.

02:47.254 --> 02:48.733
JUDGE: Ms. Amado,
did you not promise me

02:48.777 --> 02:50.605
that you would refrain
from any outbursts?

02:50.648 --> 02:53.695
Why do I refrain when everyone
else is talk, talk, talk?

02:53.738 --> 02:55.349
JUDGE: Because you
have two attorneys here

02:55.392 --> 02:57.002
talking for you.NAFTALI: No.

02:57.046 --> 02:58.874
It's because I'm Jewish.

02:58.917 --> 03:01.529
Everyone in this courtroom
is Jewish.

03:01.572 --> 03:03.357
He is not Jewish.Excuse me?

03:03.400 --> 03:05.663
Ten years on the board
at Temple Shalom.

03:05.707 --> 03:07.361
That means nothing.
Take off your pants.

03:07.404 --> 03:08.884
Let's see.JUDGE: Mr. Boseman,

03:08.927 --> 03:10.712
you don't get her
under control...

03:10.755 --> 03:11.756
Apologies, Your Honor, yes.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.018
Yes, thank you.[groans]

03:13.062 --> 03:15.891
Jay and Maia were pulled over
by the police.

03:15.934 --> 03:17.197
It was a routine traffic stop.

03:17.240 --> 03:19.242
Jesus Christ.I'm in touch with Maia.

03:19.286 --> 03:21.201
She thinks
they'll be here in 20.

03:21.244 --> 03:23.594
MAIA:
Okay.

03:23.638 --> 03:25.466
They've got a 30 minute
recess. We should be fine.

03:25.509 --> 03:27.076
Yeah, I wouldn't count on that.Please stand,

03:27.119 --> 03:29.121
place your hands on the car.You're kidding.

03:29.165 --> 03:30.384
These are yours?

03:30.427 --> 03:31.950
I have a prescription.OFFICER: Where is it?

03:31.994 --> 03:33.517
In Yerushalayim.

03:33.561 --> 03:34.779
Your drugs, your car--

03:34.823 --> 03:35.998
you're both under
arrest. Come on.

03:36.041 --> 03:37.042
Come on!

03:37.086 --> 03:38.696
Hands behind your back.

03:38.740 --> 03:40.002
Why are you doing this?

03:40.045 --> 03:41.699
Sheldon Adelson
is my cousin.

03:41.743 --> 03:43.745
This vehicle is to be impounded.
You'll need to find

03:43.788 --> 03:45.312
other means
of transportation, miss.

03:45.355 --> 03:47.009
And why am I not
being arrested?

03:47.052 --> 03:48.184
Maia, get on with Diane.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.751
26th and Cal at noon.

03:49.794 --> 03:51.143

Bond court 401.

04:05.462 --> 04:06.811
Okay.

04:06.855 --> 04:08.813
Who did the drugs belong to?

04:08.857 --> 04:10.685
The witness. They
think they're illegal.

04:10.728 --> 04:14.036
So why didn't they
take you in?

04:14.079 --> 04:17.082
I don't know. I mean, Jay says
it was "driving while black."

04:17.126 --> 04:19.781
Ugh, okay, I will argue
for an I-bond...

04:21.652 --> 04:23.393
What's wrong?

04:23.437 --> 04:26.309
Nothing. Just...

04:27.702 --> 04:29.573
Nothing.JUDGE: Docket 354-A.

04:29.617 --> 04:31.140
Male number 19.

Assault.

04:32.228 --> 04:33.273
What have you got, ASA?

04:33.316 --> 04:34.796
DIANE:
Here comes Jay.

04:34.839 --> 04:37.146
Representing the arrestee.

04:37.189 --> 04:38.495
JAY:
God.

04:38.539 --> 04:40.628
I'm happy to see you guys.What happened to Avi?

04:40.671 --> 04:42.194
He's in the group
two after mine.

04:42.238 --> 04:43.587
You all right?Yeah.

04:43.631 --> 04:45.981
Should have had Maia drive.[chuckles]

05:12.181 --> 05:14.009
They're ICE.What?

05:14.052 --> 05:15.924
Those four.

05:15.967 --> 05:18.405
They're plainclothes
immigration agents.

05:18.448 --> 05:20.885
I recognize them
from the DOJ.

05:20.929 --> 05:22.844
I think they're here
for you.

05:22.887 --> 05:24.106
Me? Why?

05:24.149 --> 05:25.368
You don't have any issues?

05:25.412 --> 05:26.891
With citizenship? No.

05:26.935 --> 05:28.980
You have your
birth certificate?Somewhere.

05:29.024 --> 05:31.026
What, are you sure
about this?

05:31.069 --> 05:32.897
I think so.

05:32.941 --> 05:34.595
DIANE:
Well, whatever Jay's status,

05:34.638 --> 05:36.858
people can be hard to reach
once they get taken in.

05:36.901 --> 05:38.947
I know.
This is how it works.

05:38.990 --> 05:41.993
They wait outside
criminal courts, take them in.

05:42.037 --> 05:43.081
JUDGE:
358-A.

05:43.125 --> 05:44.779
Male number 21, drug possession.

05:46.215 --> 05:48.043
What have you got, ASA Timmons?

05:48.086 --> 05:49.827
Mr. Dipersia
is a flight risk

05:49.871 --> 05:52.395
given his codefendant
recently arrived from overseas.

05:52.439 --> 05:53.701
Any mitigation from the defense?

05:53.744 --> 05:55.877
DIANE:
Yes, Your Honor. But first,

05:55.920 --> 05:57.400
it is our understanding

05:57.444 --> 06:00.708
that Chicago
is a sanctuary city.

06:00.751 --> 06:03.145
So we are surprised to find

06:03.188 --> 06:05.147
four immigration
officers working

06:05.190 --> 06:06.844
with the county sheriffs.

06:06.888 --> 06:09.717
Your Honor, I have no idea
what Counselor is referring to.

06:09.760 --> 06:11.458
Well, let's ask her.
What are you referring to?

06:11.501 --> 06:12.807
Those four men

06:12.850 --> 06:15.549
back there. They
are ICE agents.

06:15.592 --> 06:18.639
Gentlemen, is this true?

06:18.682 --> 06:20.292
Are you immigration enforcement?

06:20.336 --> 06:23.078
With all due deference, ma'am,
you cannot ask us that.

06:23.121 --> 06:25.733
Come here.

06:29.214 --> 06:30.477
I said come here.

06:35.307 --> 06:37.658
Ma'am?

06:37.701 --> 06:38.963
It's "Your Honor."

06:40.530 --> 06:41.792
Your Honor.

06:41.836 --> 06:43.272
JUDGE:
It's, uh, still true

06:43.315 --> 06:45.274
that we live in a democracy.

06:45.317 --> 06:47.624
But the fact is,
in these four walls,

06:47.668 --> 06:50.322
you're in a monarchy.

06:50.366 --> 06:53.282
And where I'm sitting
is the throne.

06:53.325 --> 06:56.328
Now, when I ask
you a question,

06:56.372 --> 06:58.026
I want an answer,

06:58.069 --> 07:00.985
or else I will hold you
and your colleagues in contempt.

07:01.029 --> 07:02.378
What's your name?

07:02.422 --> 07:05.250
Patrick Basehart.Why are you here?

07:05.294 --> 07:07.818
I'm a lawyer with Immigration
and Customs Enforcement.

07:07.862 --> 07:10.168
We have a detainer notice
for Jay Dipersia.

07:10.212 --> 07:12.214
JUDGE:
Counselor,

07:12.257 --> 07:14.651
for purposes of
setting bail,

07:14.695 --> 07:17.262
can you speak to some factors
in your client's favor?

07:17.306 --> 07:20.744
We have nothing to offer
in mitigation, Your Honor.

07:20.788 --> 07:24.531
TIMMONS: We request bail
to be set at $1,000.

07:24.574 --> 07:26.271
We cannot pay that amount
at this time, Your Honor.

07:26.315 --> 07:28.578
JUDGE: Well, then
I'll set bail at $100.

07:28.622 --> 07:31.146
Still too burdensome,
Your Honor.

07:31.189 --> 07:33.061
Only ten dollars is due today.

07:33.104 --> 07:34.802
That amount is simply too high.

07:34.845 --> 07:38.632
TIMMONS: Your Honor,
this is clearly a trick.

07:38.675 --> 07:40.329
The defendant is remanded

07:40.372 --> 07:44.072
to the custody of Cook County
until such time

07:44.115 --> 07:46.030
as he can post bail.

07:46.074 --> 07:47.728
Next.

07:52.559 --> 07:54.212
Okay, they can't touch you
while you're in here.

07:54.256 --> 07:56.127
You have all your documents?

07:56.171 --> 07:58.869
My sisters do.
Uh, Brigitte's a genealogy nut.

07:58.913 --> 08:00.741
She keeps every paper
and then some.

08:00.784 --> 08:02.612
You've seen
your birth certificate?Yes.

08:02.656 --> 08:04.309
I vote, I pay taxes.

08:04.353 --> 08:06.529
Okay. This is just
a bureaucratic mistake.

08:06.573 --> 08:09.227
Maia, contact his sisters.
Get his birth certificate.

08:09.271 --> 08:10.968
Yeah, and I'll get
an emergency hearing

08:11.012 --> 08:12.317
in front of an
immigration judge.

08:12.361 --> 08:15.364
Julius, we need help
bailing Avi out.

08:15.407 --> 08:16.496
I'm on my way.

08:16.539 --> 08:18.280
The judge is denying a delay.

08:28.246 --> 08:30.205
DIANE:
Good morning, Your Honor.

08:30.248 --> 08:32.860
Diane Lockhart here
on behalf of Jay Dipersia.

08:32.903 --> 08:34.426
Say it again, please. Louder.

08:34.470 --> 08:37.038
Good morning, Your Honor.

08:37.081 --> 08:40.737
Um, Diane Lockhart

08:52.140 --> 08:54.534
[speaks faintly]

08:54.577 --> 08:57.145
I'm sorry, Judge,
we can't hear you.

08:57.188 --> 08:59.800
[faintly]: I said,
good morning, too.

08:59.843 --> 09:02.193
Where is this undocumented?

09:02.237 --> 09:04.369
He is not undocumented,
Your Honor.

09:04.413 --> 09:07.895
He is currently being held
in the Cook County Courthouse

09:07.938 --> 09:09.374
on an unrelated charge.

09:12.464 --> 09:14.249
for Immigration
and Customs Enforcement.

09:14.292 --> 09:16.425
We filed a detainer notice,

09:16.468 --> 09:19.559
and we're seeking immediate
deportation to Nigeria,

country of origin.

09:22.257 --> 09:23.475
JUDGE [faintly]:
What is the basis

09:23.519 --> 09:25.565
for the detainer notice?

09:25.608 --> 09:28.002
We've scanned the individual's
birth certificate

09:28.045 --> 09:29.830
to you, Your Honor.

09:29.873 --> 09:31.179
Your Honor, we haven't...

09:31.222 --> 09:33.268
[louder]: We haven't seen
this birth certificate.

09:33.311 --> 09:37.054
It says he was born

09:37.098 --> 09:39.491
on May 2, 1980,

09:39.535 --> 09:44.105
in Barewa Hospital,
in the town of Kano,

09:44.148 --> 09:47.021
which is in the country
of Nigeria-- you see?

09:47.064 --> 09:51.025
No, no, this says

09:51.068 --> 09:53.027
"Jamil Dokpesi Dipersia,"

09:53.070 --> 09:55.377
which is not our client's name,
Your Honor.

09:55.420 --> 09:56.944
This is clearly a mistake.

09:56.987 --> 09:59.163
Your Honor, we ask
for an opportunity

09:59.207 --> 10:01.252
to provide documentation

10:01.296 --> 10:03.603
proving that Mr. Dipersia

10:03.646 --> 10:05.909
is a natural-born
American citizen.

10:05.953 --> 10:07.737
Well, how long is that
going to take?

10:07.781 --> 10:10.784
One hour, Your Honor.

10:14.352 --> 10:16.572
Maia, we have one hour.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.530
We need the birth
certificate now.

10:18.574 --> 10:20.663
We're doing our best.
His sisters think they have it,

10:20.707 --> 10:22.099
and I will
run over a copy.

10:22.143 --> 10:23.448
Great.
Okay.

10:24.754 --> 10:27.191
I-I just grabbed the box
and jumped in the car.

10:27.235 --> 10:29.237
Left the kids next door.

10:29.280 --> 10:30.891
It should be in here somewhere.

10:30.934 --> 10:33.415
This is crazy.
We were born here.

10:33.458 --> 10:35.460
Sometimes this country
makes me so mad.

10:35.504 --> 10:37.027

already dead.

10:51.389 --> 10:52.477
They have to let him go now,
right?

10:52.521 --> 10:57.178
Yeah, once we
post bail. What?

10:57.221 --> 10:58.440
Nothing.
For a second I thought

10:58.483 --> 10:59.528
I gave her the wrong
certificate.

The wrong...Oh, no, this one's mine.

accusation, Your Honor.

29:09.791 --> 29:11.662
Mr. Dipersia's sisters

29:11.706 --> 29:13.360
The fact is,
parents are preferred.

29:13.403 --> 29:15.536
Um, is there
any other basis

29:15.579 --> 29:17.364

Yes, his artwork.

of impressive skill.

29:26.199 --> 29:28.549
He's an investigator
at a law firm.

29:51.659 --> 29:55.489
Paper or no paper, you remand
him back into federal custody,

29:55.532 --> 29:56.925

in support of our application

30:45.104 --> 30:47.497

we present evidence

30:47.541 --> 30:49.108

artistic talent.

30:49.151 --> 30:50.674

Your Honor,

30:50.718 --> 30:54.896
the EB-1 visa, colloquially
known as the Einstein visa,

and significant contributions.

31:06.952 --> 31:08.736
These are the people deserving
of an Einstein visa,

six and seven figures.

31:19.529 --> 31:22.793
But rather than have us
pretend to be an expert,

31:22.837 --> 31:25.361
we have a highly
credentialed art dealer

31:25.405 --> 31:28.016
who is very familiar
with Mr. Dipersia's work

31:28.060 --> 31:30.279
and is prepared to
give his assessment.

31:30.323 --> 31:32.629
Okay. Where is he?
