WEBVTT

00:02.500 --> 00:03.458
( Kade sighs )

00:03.500 --> 00:04.667
KADE:

00:03.500 --> 00:04.667
I'm telling you,

00:04.709 --> 00:07.291
I've been on Wayward Island

00:04.709 --> 00:07.291
a million times,

00:07.333 --> 00:09.333
and there is no Energon...

00:09.375 --> 00:10.667
I don't think.

00:10.709 --> 00:12.208
Optimus himself

00:10.709 --> 00:12.208
notified us

00:12.250 --> 00:13.542
of a faint Energon signal

00:13.583 --> 00:15.208
emanating from these

00:13.583 --> 00:15.208
coordinates.

00:15.250 --> 00:18.208
If we find it, maybe he'll send

00:15.250 --> 00:18.208
Bumblebee to pick it up

00:18.250 --> 00:20.083
and congratulate us!

00:20.125 --> 00:22.208
Don't start inflating

00:20.125 --> 00:22.208
the balloons yet.

00:22.250 --> 00:24.417
We have to find the stuff first.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.041
( radar beeps )

00:27.417 --> 00:28.917
Down here.

00:32.625 --> 00:35.291
DANI:

00:32.625 --> 00:35.291
If the Energon's been here

00:32.625 --> 00:35.291
all this time,

00:35.333 --> 00:37.458
why did Optimus only now

00:35.333 --> 00:37.458
get a reading on it?

00:37.500 --> 00:39.250
These ice caves

00:37.500 --> 00:39.250
have probably

00:39.291 --> 00:41.000
been slowly melting

00:39.291 --> 00:41.000
for centuries.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.792
Maybe only recently a tracking

00:41.041 --> 00:43.792
signal could get through.

00:46.583 --> 00:48.333
Cave paintings.

00:48.375 --> 00:50.709
Some prehistoric clan

00:48.375 --> 00:50.709
must have lived here.

00:50.750 --> 00:53.291
Let's scrape

00:50.750 --> 00:53.291
the frost off.

00:53.333 --> 00:55.583
This isn't a Lad Pioneer trip.

00:55.625 --> 00:57.417
We're on an important mission.

00:57.458 --> 00:59.333
All right,

00:57.458 --> 00:59.333
getting closer.

00:59.375 --> 01:01.750
(  tender theme playing  )

01:14.625 --> 01:16.667
Hey, guys,

01:14.625 --> 01:16.667
check it out.

01:16.709 --> 01:18.750
Guys?

01:16.709 --> 01:18.750
( rumbling )

01:19.750 --> 01:21.250
Aah!

01:19.750 --> 01:21.250
( grunts )

01:21.291 --> 01:22.583
Cody.

01:22.625 --> 01:24.750
I'm fine, Dad.

01:22.625 --> 01:24.750
Thanks, Heatwave.

01:24.792 --> 01:26.250
Don't thank me.

01:26.291 --> 01:27.875
I think you found

01:26.291 --> 01:27.875
what we're looking for.

01:27.917 --> 01:30.333
Then let's retrieve it

01:27.917 --> 01:30.333
and get out of here.

01:30.375 --> 01:31.750
This place is giving me the--

02:12.959 --> 02:14.250
Fascinating.

02:14.291 --> 02:16.375
This is the find

02:14.291 --> 02:16.375
of the century.

02:16.417 --> 02:18.667
Of the past

02:16.417 --> 02:18.667
thousand centuries.

02:18.709 --> 02:22.750
A perfectly preserved specimen

02:18.709 --> 02:22.750
from the neo-Paleolithic period.

02:22.792 --> 02:25.709
Think of what we can learn

02:22.792 --> 02:25.709
by examining him.

02:25.750 --> 02:29.083
Um, did anybody else

02:25.750 --> 02:29.083
just see his finger move?

02:29.125 --> 02:30.333
( laughs )

02:30.375 --> 02:31.709
You sure that stalactite

02:31.750 --> 02:33.041
didn't hit you

02:31.750 --> 02:33.041
on the head?

02:35.417 --> 02:38.709
Toe twitch. I definitely

02:35.417 --> 02:38.709
saw a toe twitch. Cody's right.

02:40.542 --> 02:42.166
Unbelievable.

02:42.208 --> 02:46.542
Signs of respiration, heartbeat,

02:42.208 --> 02:46.542
brain waves.

02:46.583 --> 02:49.166
It's alive!

02:49.208 --> 02:50.750
How is that even possible?

02:50.792 --> 02:53.083
The sub-zero

02:50.792 --> 02:53.083
temperatures,

02:53.125 --> 02:55.375
interacting with

02:53.125 --> 02:55.375
the Energon shard,

02:55.417 --> 02:56.709
must have put

02:55.417 --> 02:56.709
our friend here

02:56.750 --> 02:58.709
in a state

02:56.750 --> 02:58.709
of suspended animation.

02:58.750 --> 03:00.959
Let's wake him up.

02:58.750 --> 03:00.959
Start chipping.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.250
( gasps ):

03:01.000 --> 03:02.250
We can melt him.

03:02.291 --> 03:03.500
I'll go get a hair dryer.

03:03.542 --> 03:04.834
DOC GREENE:

03:03.542 --> 03:04.834
Not so fast,

03:04.875 --> 03:06.625
my eager little

03:04.875 --> 03:06.625
anthropologists.

03:06.667 --> 03:08.959
The caveman's been asleep

03:06.667 --> 03:08.959
a long time.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.208
We need a thawing process

03:09.000 --> 03:12.208
that won't shock his system.

03:14.333 --> 03:16.083
Oh, a beta-base macrowave.

03:16.125 --> 03:18.875
In combination with

03:16.125 --> 03:18.875
nano-spectrality diffusion.

03:18.917 --> 03:20.959
Yep, that's how

03:18.917 --> 03:20.959
I'd do it.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.583
( steam hissing )

03:24.667 --> 03:26.333
( machine beeps )

03:33.083 --> 03:35.500
( yawns )

03:36.625 --> 03:38.375
( grunts )

03:38.417 --> 03:40.583
( screams )

03:45.667 --> 03:48.041
( gasping and panting )

03:50.166 --> 03:51.959
What's going on?

03:55.375 --> 03:57.291
Oh...

03:58.333 --> 03:59.750
He likes me.

03:59.792 --> 04:01.000
( sniffs )

04:01.041 --> 04:02.583
Better you than me.

04:02.625 --> 04:04.625
Ugh, he smells funny.

04:04.667 --> 04:06.041
CAVEMAN:

04:04.667 --> 04:06.041
Oh...

04:06.083 --> 04:10.083
Aw, he likes me too.

04:06.083 --> 04:10.083
He's nice.

04:10.125 --> 04:12.834
As long as you don't

04:10.125 --> 04:12.834
inhale.

04:12.875 --> 04:14.709
Don't even think

04:12.875 --> 04:14.709
about it.

04:16.333 --> 04:19.000
He seems to really

04:16.333 --> 04:19.000
have a thing for Bots.

04:19.041 --> 04:22.000
Something about our presence

04:19.041 --> 04:22.000
seems to calm the humanoid.

04:22.041 --> 04:24.208
But why?

04:24.250 --> 04:27.041
No idea.

04:24.250 --> 04:27.041
But whatever works.

04:27.083 --> 04:28.834
Let's take him back

04:27.083 --> 04:28.834
to the firehouse.

04:28.875 --> 04:31.500
You Bots can spend

04:28.875 --> 04:31.500
some quality time with him.

04:32.667 --> 04:34.208
( chomping )

04:36.667 --> 04:38.333
Such a good appetite.

04:38.375 --> 04:40.166
But horrendous

04:38.375 --> 04:40.166
table manners.

04:40.208 --> 04:41.417
Which I could forgive...

04:41.458 --> 04:42.667
( sniffs )

04:42.709 --> 04:44.208
...if it wasn't for the odor.

04:44.250 --> 04:45.917
( chuckling ):

04:44.250 --> 04:45.917
Kind of understandable,

04:45.959 --> 04:48.500
given how long he's been

04:45.959 --> 04:48.500
wearing that animal skin.

04:48.542 --> 04:50.458
We should get him

04:48.542 --> 04:50.458
some new clothes.

04:50.500 --> 04:52.041
Mall trip!

04:52.083 --> 04:54.625
Probably not a good idea.

04:52.083 --> 04:54.625
If somebody saw him...

04:54.667 --> 04:57.083
Every looky-loo in the country

04:54.667 --> 04:57.083
would show up to hound him.

04:57.125 --> 04:59.333
We can find some clothes

04:57.125 --> 04:59.333
around here to give him.

05:02.417 --> 05:04.500
It would appear that he is what

05:02.417 --> 05:04.500
is referred to

05:04.542 --> 05:06.500
as a "42 regular."

05:06.542 --> 05:09.917
Now who do we know

05:06.542 --> 05:09.917
who's that size?

05:15.083 --> 05:16.667
Perfect fit.

05:16.709 --> 05:19.417
I always suspected

05:16.709 --> 05:19.417
Kade was part caveman.

05:19.458 --> 05:22.000
My name is Blades.

05:22.041 --> 05:25.417
What is your name?

05:25.458 --> 05:27.125
( grunts )

05:29.250 --> 05:30.959
I think he said "Ira."

05:31.000 --> 05:32.458
I think he just grunted.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.333
Ira is as good a name

05:32.500 --> 05:34.333
as any.

05:34.375 --> 05:36.458
All this Welcome Wagon stuff

05:34.375 --> 05:36.458
can wait.

05:36.500 --> 05:38.709
We have a mission

05:36.500 --> 05:38.709
from Optimus, remember?

05:38.750 --> 05:40.166
That Ira interrupted.

05:40.208 --> 05:42.375
The Energon

05:40.208 --> 05:42.375
in that necklace.

05:42.417 --> 05:44.208
Where'd it come from?

05:44.250 --> 05:46.166
He doesn't understand.

05:46.208 --> 05:49.250
Yeah, I kind of picked up

05:46.208 --> 05:49.250
on that.

05:49.291 --> 05:52.166
The cave drawings we encountered

05:49.291 --> 05:52.166
would indicate that Ira's clan

05:52.208 --> 05:53.875
was visually oriented.

05:53.917 --> 05:56.917
Great idea.

05:53.917 --> 05:56.917
Cody, my art supplies.

05:59.709 --> 06:03.917
Energon. Where can we

05:59.709 --> 06:03.917
find more?

06:06.458 --> 06:07.709
Ooh.

06:09.375 --> 06:11.458
No, Ira. Spit that out.

06:11.500 --> 06:12.709
( spits )

06:12.750 --> 06:13.959
Bleh!

06:14.000 --> 06:15.417
( coughs and spits )

06:15.458 --> 06:16.750
He just needs to learn

06:16.792 --> 06:18.542
how to get along

06:16.792 --> 06:18.542
in the modern world.

06:20.458 --> 06:23.625
Ira, this is called a banjo.

06:23.667 --> 06:26.041
It makes music that most humans

06:23.667 --> 06:26.041
find annoying.

06:26.083 --> 06:27.834
And this is a lamp.

06:27.875 --> 06:31.834
It provides light,

06:27.875 --> 06:31.834
so you can make shadow puppets.

06:31.875 --> 06:33.417
( groans )

06:34.500 --> 06:36.709
( tweets )

06:36.750 --> 06:38.166
Wow. That's great, Ira.

06:38.208 --> 06:39.667
He's obviously

06:38.208 --> 06:39.667
done that before.

06:39.709 --> 06:42.750
Mmm. Must be the caveman

06:39.709 --> 06:42.750
equivalent of television.

06:42.792 --> 06:44.208
TV!

06:44.250 --> 06:46.083
That's how

06:44.250 --> 06:46.083
we can teach Ira.

06:46.125 --> 06:48.500
I mean look how much

06:46.125 --> 06:48.500
I've learned from it.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.333
( dramatic music playing

06:48.542 --> 06:50.333
over TV )

06:51.875 --> 06:53.208
( police siren wailing over TV )

06:54.917 --> 06:56.625
And, of course, the booths

06:54.917 --> 06:56.625
at, uh, crawfish week--

06:56.667 --> 06:57.875
( changes channel )

06:57.917 --> 06:59.875
( ominous music playing

06:57.917 --> 06:59.875
over TV )

06:59.917 --> 07:01.375
( gasps )

07:02.917 --> 07:04.625
( screams )

07:07.083 --> 07:08.917
( grunting and panting )

07:13.667 --> 07:15.083
HEATWAVE:

07:13.667 --> 07:15.083
We have a runner.

07:15.125 --> 07:17.709
Rescue Bots,

07:15.125 --> 07:17.709
roll to the rescue.

07:27.750 --> 07:29.709
( emergency sirens blaring )

07:29.750 --> 07:31.583
( radar beeps )

07:29.750 --> 07:31.583
Got a read.

07:31.625 --> 07:33.792
That Energon necklace makes

07:31.625 --> 07:33.792
a pretty good tracking device.

07:35.291 --> 07:37.166
I certainly

07:35.291 --> 07:37.166
didn't expect you

07:37.208 --> 07:40.208
to personally pick me up

07:37.208 --> 07:40.208
from the ferry, Mayor Luskey.

07:40.250 --> 07:43.834
The least I could do,

07:40.250 --> 07:43.834
Mrs. Dumont.

07:43.875 --> 07:47.166
For someone who's been such

07:43.875 --> 07:47.166
a generous benefactor

07:47.208 --> 07:49.959
to our scientific

07:47.208 --> 07:49.959
community.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.208
( laughs )

07:51.250 --> 07:52.500
( both exclaim )

07:53.834 --> 07:55.959
( tires screech )

07:53.834 --> 07:55.959
Aah!

07:56.000 --> 07:58.333
( electricity crackles )

08:01.500 --> 08:03.500
( grunts )

08:05.000 --> 08:08.500
MAYOR LUSKEY:

08:05.000 --> 08:08.500
It just came

08:05.000 --> 08:08.500
from out of nowhere.

08:08.542 --> 08:10.041
Wh-- What did?

08:10.083 --> 08:12.458
Thank goodness

08:10.083 --> 08:12.458
you're all right.

08:13.500 --> 08:14.709
Oh!

08:13.500 --> 08:14.709
What?

08:14.750 --> 08:17.375
I'm afraid neither of us are.

08:21.458 --> 08:22.959
( sirens blaring )

08:25.583 --> 08:27.542
Stay in your vehicle,

08:25.583 --> 08:27.542
Mr. Mayor.

08:40.667 --> 08:43.041
Any sign of our

08:40.667 --> 08:43.041
runaway caveman?

08:43.083 --> 08:46.417
No. But I'm betting

08:43.083 --> 08:46.417
he took to the rooftops.

08:46.458 --> 08:48.583
Dani and Blades?

08:48.625 --> 08:50.625
We're on it.

08:48.625 --> 08:50.625
GRAHAM: We are too.

08:52.417 --> 08:55.709
Poor guy,

08:52.417 --> 08:55.709
out on his own.

08:55.750 --> 08:57.458
Strange new world.

09:06.208 --> 09:07.959
( exclaims )

09:10.083 --> 09:12.792
And then

09:10.083 --> 09:12.792
out of nowhere

09:12.834 --> 09:15.959
jumped this--

09:12.834 --> 09:15.959
This creature.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.166
Most likely a bear.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.166
Or a moose.

09:19.208 --> 09:21.834
I've never seen

09:19.208 --> 09:21.834
a moose downtown.

09:21.875 --> 09:24.125
That means we're doing our job,

09:21.875 --> 09:24.125
Mr. Mayor,

09:24.166 --> 09:26.500
keeping them in the woods,

09:24.166 --> 09:26.500
where they belong.

09:26.542 --> 09:27.750
You're welcome.

09:27.792 --> 09:29.166
You all right, ma'am?

09:29.208 --> 09:31.041
The accident must've given you

09:29.208 --> 09:31.041
quite a scare.

09:31.083 --> 09:34.625
Chief, Mrs. Dumont's considering

09:31.083 --> 09:34.625
making a huge contribution

09:34.667 --> 09:36.959
for the new Luskey Wing

09:34.667 --> 09:36.959
of the museum.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.041
So we can't have

09:37.000 --> 09:40.041
any more incidents

09:40.083 --> 09:42.542
that will sour her

09:40.083 --> 09:42.542
on our town.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.667
You understand?

09:44.709 --> 09:47.291
GRAHAM:

09:44.709 --> 09:47.291
Tracking signals lead directly

09:44.709 --> 09:47.291
to the museum.

09:48.625 --> 09:50.417
But it's closed

09:48.625 --> 09:50.417
for renovation.

09:50.458 --> 09:52.083
Guess nobody

09:50.458 --> 09:52.083
told Ira that.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.917
( alarm beeping )

09:52.125 --> 09:53.917
Silent alarm's been triggered.

09:58.333 --> 09:59.583
There.

10:02.083 --> 10:03.709
( groans )

10:07.542 --> 10:08.917
( sobs )

10:10.542 --> 10:12.375
Wonder what's got him

10:10.542 --> 10:12.375
so upset?

10:12.417 --> 10:15.333
He's homesick.

10:12.417 --> 10:15.333
I have this.

10:17.834 --> 10:19.125
Hey, Ira.

10:20.542 --> 10:22.083
I know how you feel.

10:22.125 --> 10:23.709
You miss your old world.

10:23.750 --> 10:26.625
But you can't go back.

10:26.667 --> 10:29.208
It's gone forever.

10:29.250 --> 10:30.750
So wave goodbye

10:29.250 --> 10:30.750
to your friends here,

10:30.792 --> 10:33.500
and come home

10:30.792 --> 10:33.500
with your buddy Boulder.

10:33.542 --> 10:34.959
Bye-bye.

10:39.583 --> 10:42.709
I think Ira's not the only one

10:39.583 --> 10:42.709
who's homesick.

10:45.750 --> 10:48.417
( gadget humming )

10:48.458 --> 10:50.125
Hmm.

10:50.166 --> 10:52.959
His vital signs and blood

10:50.166 --> 10:52.959
pressure are slightly elevated.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.959
It's only natural that the

10:53.000 --> 10:55.959
trappings of the modern world

10:56.000 --> 10:58.333
would be upsetting to Ira.

10:58.375 --> 11:00.834
There are lots of good things

10:58.375 --> 11:00.834
nowadays too, Ira,

11:00.875 --> 11:02.792
like...

11:02.834 --> 11:04.709
music whenever you want it.

11:04.750 --> 11:06.125
( classical piano music

11:04.750 --> 11:06.125
playing )

11:06.166 --> 11:07.542
Oh.

11:07.583 --> 11:09.417
Wish we could show him

11:07.583 --> 11:09.417
more of the world

11:09.458 --> 11:11.709
instead of having

11:09.458 --> 11:11.709
to keep him cooped up.

11:11.750 --> 11:14.166
Cooped up or not,

11:11.750 --> 11:14.166
Ira's not getting us any closer

11:14.208 --> 11:16.250
to locating the Energon.

11:16.291 --> 11:18.041
Or to Bumblebee

11:16.291 --> 11:18.041
coming to tell us

11:18.083 --> 11:20.375
how awesome we are

11:18.083 --> 11:20.375
for finding it.

11:20.417 --> 11:22.291
Then what say

11:20.417 --> 11:22.291
we go look for it.

11:22.333 --> 11:24.417
You and me.

11:22.333 --> 11:24.417
To Wayward Island.

11:24.458 --> 11:25.750
Yes!

11:27.041 --> 11:28.625
( grunts )

11:30.250 --> 11:32.959
My best recommendation

11:30.250 --> 11:32.959
for Ira right now:

11:33.000 --> 11:35.959
as little stimulation

11:33.000 --> 11:35.959
as possible.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.375
Return him to the firehouse

11:36.000 --> 11:38.375
for some rest and--

11:38.417 --> 11:40.333
MAYOR LUSKEY:

11:38.417 --> 11:40.333
Knock, knock. Who's there?

11:40.375 --> 11:41.667
His Honor.

11:45.917 --> 11:49.041
And a very special VIP.

11:49.083 --> 11:54.000
Dr. Greene, I don't believe

11:49.083 --> 11:54.000
you've ever met Mrs. Dumont.

11:54.041 --> 11:55.709
Uh, yes.

11:55.750 --> 11:57.458
Uh, that is, no.

11:57.500 --> 12:00.458
But on behalf

11:57.500 --> 12:00.458
of the scientific community,

12:00.500 --> 12:04.125
I thank you for your, uh,

12:00.500 --> 12:04.125
huge endowments.

12:04.166 --> 12:07.583
It's a pleasure to meet

12:04.166 --> 12:07.583
such a noted scientist.

12:07.625 --> 12:10.959
I would love to see

12:07.625 --> 12:10.959
what you're working on.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.917
Well, I'm currently working

12:11.000 --> 12:14.917
on this...Bunsen burner.

12:14.959 --> 12:18.583
A turn of this knob,

12:14.959 --> 12:18.583
and presto.

12:18.625 --> 12:20.417
Wow.

12:18.625 --> 12:20.417
Amazing.

12:20.458 --> 12:21.667
( thump on door )

12:21.709 --> 12:23.417
Switches right on.

12:23.458 --> 12:26.917
Your fundraising dinner's

12:23.458 --> 12:26.917
in a few hours, Mr. Mayor.

12:26.959 --> 12:29.125
Mrs. Dumont, you probably want

12:26.959 --> 12:29.125
to get to your hotel room

12:29.166 --> 12:30.583
and freshen up.

12:30.625 --> 12:33.291
Now that you mention it,

12:30.625 --> 12:33.291
I could use a bit of--

12:33.333 --> 12:34.583
( door rattling )

12:34.625 --> 12:36.875
FRANKIE: No, Ira!

12:34.625 --> 12:36.875
Come back.

12:36.917 --> 12:39.458
Oh. Hello, Frankie.

12:39.500 --> 12:42.041
I see that you found, um...

12:42.083 --> 12:43.291
Dr. Ira.

12:43.333 --> 12:45.417
Right. One of my colleagues.

12:45.458 --> 12:47.834
( grunts and mumbles )

12:47.875 --> 12:50.333
He looks

12:47.875 --> 12:50.333
vaguely familiar.

12:50.375 --> 12:52.083
And why is he

12:50.375 --> 12:52.083
grunting?

12:52.125 --> 12:54.458
Uh, he's not from here.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.208
He's from--

12:54.500 --> 12:56.208
Freedonia.

12:56.250 --> 12:58.625
A very guttural language.

12:58.667 --> 13:00.709
( grunts )

13:00.750 --> 13:02.250
That means "hello."

13:04.458 --> 13:07.792
And "bragh" to you as well,

13:04.458 --> 13:07.792
Dr. Ira.

13:07.834 --> 13:10.458
Charmed, I'm sure.

13:13.834 --> 13:15.834
( giggling ):

13:13.834 --> 13:15.834
Ooh!

13:15.875 --> 13:18.875
Oh, what a delightful custom.

13:18.917 --> 13:22.500
So, Dr. Greene,

13:18.917 --> 13:22.500
what sort of experiments

13:22.542 --> 13:25.875
are you and Dr. Ira

13:22.542 --> 13:25.875
working on together?

13:25.917 --> 13:30.583
Well, a bit of this,

13:25.917 --> 13:30.583
and a bit of that.

13:30.625 --> 13:31.834
( sniffs )

13:31.875 --> 13:33.291
Uh...

13:34.667 --> 13:36.417
Uh, the edible pencil.

13:36.458 --> 13:38.625
For when you just have

13:36.458 --> 13:38.625
to have a snack

13:38.667 --> 13:40.750
while doing homework.

13:40.792 --> 13:42.542
Uh, may I try?

13:42.583 --> 13:43.792
ALL:

13:42.583 --> 13:43.792
No!

13:43.834 --> 13:45.083
It's a...prototype.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.125
Not ready for public

13:45.125 --> 13:47.125
consumption.

13:47.166 --> 13:51.500
Oh. Well, we'll leave you

13:47.166 --> 13:51.500
to your important work.

13:51.542 --> 13:54.291
But, Dr. Greene, you simply must

13:51.542 --> 13:54.291
bring the delightful

13:54.333 --> 13:56.583
Dr. Ira to tonight's dinner.

13:56.625 --> 13:58.959
Uh, that's gonna

13:56.625 --> 13:58.959
be difficult.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.417
Dr. Ira here has to catch

13:59.000 --> 14:01.417
a flight first thing--

14:01.458 --> 14:03.959
Chief, if I may.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.458
If Mrs. Dumont

14:04.000 --> 14:07.458
wants Dr. Ira there,

14:07.500 --> 14:09.959
I won't take no for answer.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.917
Of course.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.917
I'll bring Dr. Ira personally.

14:13.959 --> 14:15.959
Police escort.

14:16.041 --> 14:18.917
Shall we,

14:16.041 --> 14:18.917
Mrs. Dumont?

14:18.959 --> 14:21.166
Ira at a fancy dinner.

14:21.208 --> 14:22.875
( spits )

14:22.917 --> 14:24.500
Whoa.

14:28.542 --> 14:29.959
Not a beep.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.333
Aah!

14:31.375 --> 14:33.709
Heatwave, if there's

14:31.375 --> 14:33.709
no Energon,

14:33.750 --> 14:35.458
let's get out of here.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.709
This place has a habit

14:35.500 --> 14:37.709
of caving in.

14:37.750 --> 14:41.000
Wait. I want to get a closer

14:37.750 --> 14:41.000
look at those scribbles.

14:41.041 --> 14:43.417
Who knows? They might give us

14:41.041 --> 14:43.417
some info.

14:47.875 --> 14:49.083
Whoa.

14:49.125 --> 14:50.959
Are those...?

14:49.125 --> 14:50.959
Yeah.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.500
Our clan.

14:52.542 --> 14:54.000
Autobots.

14:58.250 --> 15:00.166
( grumbles )

15:00.208 --> 15:03.000
Hey, you're stretching the

15:00.208 --> 15:03.000
collar. It's my only good suit.

15:03.041 --> 15:05.291
( growls )

15:03.041 --> 15:05.291
Okay.

15:05.333 --> 15:08.500
You are not going

15:05.333 --> 15:08.500
to believe what we found.

15:10.959 --> 15:12.583
( Ira gasps )

15:15.792 --> 15:17.000
Are those...?

15:17.041 --> 15:19.458
Bots? No way.

15:19.500 --> 15:21.375
( Ira whimpers )

15:23.083 --> 15:24.583
No wonder Ira felt such

15:23.083 --> 15:24.583
an immediate connection

15:24.625 --> 15:26.166
to you guys.

15:26.208 --> 15:28.583
He must have known the Autobots

15:26.208 --> 15:28.583
in that painting.

15:28.625 --> 15:31.542
You Bots have been around

15:28.625 --> 15:31.542
since caveman days?

15:31.583 --> 15:34.291
This-- I don't know

15:31.583 --> 15:34.291
what to make of.

15:34.333 --> 15:37.250
( whimpers )

15:37.291 --> 15:39.625
Some kind of meteor shower?

15:39.667 --> 15:41.291
It's okay, Ira.

15:41.333 --> 15:42.709
( grunts )

15:51.542 --> 15:53.083
I think Ira's

15:51.542 --> 15:53.083
trying to tell us

15:53.125 --> 15:55.417
that Autobots saved him

15:53.125 --> 15:55.417
from the meteors.

15:55.458 --> 15:57.250
What about the rest

15:55.458 --> 15:57.250
of his clan?

15:57.291 --> 15:59.333
Hopefully the Bots

15:57.291 --> 15:59.333
saved them as well.

15:59.375 --> 16:01.792
But somehow

15:59.375 --> 16:01.792
Ira got left behind.

16:01.834 --> 16:04.959
So our fellow Cybertronians gave

16:01.834 --> 16:04.959
him the Energon amulet

16:05.000 --> 16:06.959
to keep him alive

16:05.000 --> 16:06.959
in a frozen state.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.959
If he knew those Bots,

16:09.000 --> 16:11.875
it's almost for sure he knows

16:09.000 --> 16:11.875
where there's more Energon.

16:11.917 --> 16:15.083
That may be, but now's not

16:11.917 --> 16:15.083
the time to pump Ira for info.

16:15.125 --> 16:16.834
Like it or not,

16:16.875 --> 16:19.333
Chase and I have to get him

16:16.875 --> 16:19.333
to the mayor's dinner.

16:20.875 --> 16:22.875
( indistinct chatter )

16:25.667 --> 16:27.959
May I propose a toast.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.500
To Mrs. Dumont,

16:29.542 --> 16:33.083
for all her past generosity

16:29.542 --> 16:33.083
to our town.

16:33.125 --> 16:36.375
May it continue in the future.

16:36.417 --> 16:37.917
( chuckles )

16:39.333 --> 16:41.417
Bleh!

16:45.625 --> 16:47.250
Huh?

16:47.291 --> 16:49.166
DOC GREENE:

16:47.291 --> 16:49.166
Ira.

16:52.542 --> 16:53.917
Ugh!

16:53.959 --> 16:56.250
Uh...an old Freedonian custom.

16:56.291 --> 16:59.750
Then I assume it would be rude

16:56.291 --> 16:59.750
not to join in.

17:05.166 --> 17:08.667
Oh, my. What an interesting way

17:05.166 --> 17:08.667
to eat lobster.

17:08.709 --> 17:12.000
Uh, but-- But how exactly

17:08.709 --> 17:12.000
does one--?

17:12.041 --> 17:13.875
This might be a good time

17:13.917 --> 17:18.542
to invite everyone outside

17:13.917 --> 17:18.542
for my special surprise.

17:20.041 --> 17:21.333
( chomping )

17:21.375 --> 17:22.625
( groans )

17:22.667 --> 17:24.250
( imitates groan )

17:24.291 --> 17:26.583
That means "hello"

17:24.291 --> 17:26.583
in Freedonian.

17:28.542 --> 17:31.291
Over here,

17:28.542 --> 17:31.291
Mrs. Dumont.

17:31.333 --> 17:34.583
The perfect spot to watch

17:31.333 --> 17:34.583
the surprise:

17:34.625 --> 17:36.458
fireworks.

17:36.500 --> 17:38.458
( fireworks whistle and pop )

17:36.500 --> 17:38.458
( gasps )

17:42.709 --> 17:44.542
Ira!

17:44.583 --> 17:47.083
Rescue team.

17:44.583 --> 17:47.083
Ira's on the loose,

17:47.125 --> 17:48.792
vicinity of city hall.

17:48.834 --> 17:51.208
Cody, see if you can

17:48.834 --> 17:51.208
get a read on him.

17:51.250 --> 17:53.875
Got him. He's heading

17:51.250 --> 17:53.875
for the radio tower.

17:53.917 --> 17:56.291
(  dramatic theme playing  )

18:03.834 --> 18:07.041
( fireworks whistle and pop )

18:11.125 --> 18:12.709
( growls )

18:14.291 --> 18:16.834
( siren blaring )

18:16.875 --> 18:19.125
He must think the fireworks

18:16.875 --> 18:19.125
are meteors,

18:19.166 --> 18:20.917
like the ones

18:19.166 --> 18:20.917
that destroyed his home.

18:20.959 --> 18:23.875
He's trying to protect

18:20.959 --> 18:23.875
his family. Us.

18:28.333 --> 18:31.375
( grunting )

18:34.792 --> 18:35.959
Blades, your winch.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.583
Hang back, Dani.

18:37.625 --> 18:40.375
Ira sees you flying in,

18:37.625 --> 18:40.375
it could upset him even more.

18:40.417 --> 18:44.166
I can talk him down.

18:40.417 --> 18:44.166
Dani, Blades, come and get me.

18:47.959 --> 18:49.750
( grunting )

18:49.792 --> 18:52.333
Ira, stop. It's okay.

18:56.709 --> 18:58.375
( screams )

19:00.834 --> 19:03.166
I got you, buddy.

19:08.458 --> 19:10.542
We can't keep Ira here

19:08.458 --> 19:10.542
any longer.

19:10.583 --> 19:14.166
He's a danger to himself

19:10.583 --> 19:14.166
and to others.

19:14.208 --> 19:16.875
I agree. As much as the world

19:14.208 --> 19:16.875
would benefit

19:16.917 --> 19:18.417
from learning about him,

19:18.458 --> 19:22.166
I'm afraid the reverse

19:18.458 --> 19:22.166
is sadly not true.

19:27.083 --> 19:29.583
( whimpers )

19:29.625 --> 19:31.333
Sure, it used

19:29.625 --> 19:31.333
to be his home,

19:31.375 --> 19:34.750
but how's Ira gonna be happy

19:31.375 --> 19:34.750
here all by himself?

19:34.792 --> 19:37.041
( bird chirps )

19:37.083 --> 19:39.458
Oh. Peep, peep, peep!

19:39.500 --> 19:42.083
Something tells me

19:39.500 --> 19:42.083
he's gonna like it just fine.

19:42.125 --> 19:46.333
And by the way, the mayor said

19:42.125 --> 19:46.333
to say thanks to Dr. Ira.

19:46.375 --> 19:49.834
Mrs. Dumont was so charmed,

19:46.375 --> 19:49.834
she doubled her contribution.

19:49.875 --> 19:51.458
This is our last chance.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.709
Ask him if he knows

19:51.500 --> 19:53.709
where the Energon is.

19:56.917 --> 19:58.375
Huh?

19:58.417 --> 20:00.125
More Energon.

20:00.166 --> 20:01.959
Where is more?

20:08.709 --> 20:12.834
Some help. Scribbles of some

20:08.709 --> 20:12.834
hills and of Ira waving.

20:12.875 --> 20:14.417
( chittering )

20:16.625 --> 20:18.000
( imitating squirrels chitter )

20:18.041 --> 20:19.250
( laughs )

20:19.291 --> 20:20.542
Go, Ira.

20:32.625 --> 20:34.417
He'll be okay.

20:34.458 --> 20:36.041
I know he will.

20:36.083 --> 20:38.041
But what about you?

20:38.083 --> 20:41.166
Looks like you're feeling

20:38.083 --> 20:41.166
a little homesick too.

20:41.208 --> 20:44.917
Maybe, but even though I can't

20:41.208 --> 20:44.917
go back to where I came from,

20:44.959 --> 20:49.208
as long as I have my friends

20:44.959 --> 20:49.208
and my team, this is home.

20:49.250 --> 20:51.500
Just wish I could take

20:49.250 --> 20:51.500
this drawing with me

20:51.542 --> 20:53.083
to remember him by.

20:53.125 --> 20:54.709
I'll take a picture of it

20:53.125 --> 20:54.709
for you.

20:54.750 --> 20:55.959
( camera shutters click )

20:56.000 --> 20:58.333
Hmm, Ira's primitive drawing

20:58.375 --> 21:00.625
could almost be a map

20:58.375 --> 21:00.625
of this area.

21:00.667 --> 21:04.458
Some help. We already know

21:00.667 --> 21:04.458
there's no Energon in there.

21:04.500 --> 21:08.542
Maybe there never was any

21:04.500 --> 21:08.542
big Energon supply after all.

21:08.583 --> 21:10.500
Just what was in

21:08.583 --> 21:10.500
Ira's necklace.

21:10.542 --> 21:13.333
You never know. If the ice caves

21:10.542 --> 21:13.333
continue to thaw,

21:13.375 --> 21:15.291
someday you might

21:13.375 --> 21:15.291
get a stronger reading.

21:15.333 --> 21:18.166
It would be prudent

21:15.333 --> 21:18.166
to check back occasionally.

21:18.208 --> 21:19.792
Doesn't help us now.

21:22.959 --> 21:26.208
(  dramatic theme playing  )

21:31.250 --> 21:33.709
(  dramatic theme playing  )
