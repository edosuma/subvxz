WEBVTT

00:48.400 --> 00:51.051
<i>Look at them go! Into the final lap.</i>

00:57.920 --> 00:59.410
<i>And here comes number seven...</i>

00:59.480 --> 01:00.970
<i>Dusty Crophopper!</i>

01:09.360 --> 01:11.010
<i>And Dusty wins the gold!</i>

01:11.080 --> 01:12.206
Go, Duster!

01:16.520 --> 01:18.761
Dusty, you were just
a small-town crop duster

01:18.840 --> 01:20.444
who overcame impossible odds

01:20.520 --> 01:22.443
to win the Wings Around
the Globe Rally.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.608
And now, you're an air racing legend.

01:24.680 --> 01:26.091
Well, Brent, I've had an amazing team

01:26.160 --> 01:27.685
supporting me every step of the way.

01:27.840 --> 01:29.410
<i>The best coach, the best mechanic...</i>

01:29.480 --> 01:31.448
<i>and the best fuel truck
that anyone could ask for.</i>

01:31.520 --> 01:33.602
Hey, wait a minute.
You're a gas consultant.

01:33.680 --> 01:36.365
That's correct. I've got gas.

02:18.240 --> 02:21.767
Awesome pic, Dust,
except your eyes are closed.

02:22.120 --> 02:24.401
Racing with your eyes closed,
huh? So, that's your secret.

02:24.440 --> 02:25.840
Oh, yeah, you figured it out, Chug.

02:25.880 --> 02:28.451
That was
some pretty fancy flying, Dusty.

02:28.520 --> 02:30.568
Saw it all on my radio with pictures.

02:31.680 --> 02:33.125
Um, you mean your TV.

02:33.200 --> 02:34.486
No, no. That's clearing up.

02:34.560 --> 02:36.801
My bumper was nearly
corroded right through.

02:36.880 --> 02:39.087
- All right.
- Disgusting looking.

02:39.160 --> 02:41.322
Ah, yeah, it was all rusty and blistered.

02:41.400 --> 02:43.084
I got it. Anyway, what else is going on?

02:43.160 --> 02:46.448
Dottie gave me some of that Rust-eze
Medicated Bumper Ointment.

02:46.560 --> 02:48.164
Ah!

02:48.240 --> 02:50.004
- How's it look now?
- Looks great. Fine.

02:50.080 --> 02:52.162
- Take a closer look.
- That's close enough.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.446
- Oh.
- What was that?

02:53.800 --> 02:55.529
Didn't need to see that.

02:55.600 --> 02:57.329
Oh, hey, hey, guys, guys. Listen to this.

02:57.400 --> 03:00.324
"After his Red Bulldozer win,
Dusty Crophopper..."

03:00.400 --> 03:02.243
- That's you.
- "...returns to Propwash Junction..."

03:02.320 --> 03:03.810
- That's here.
- "...where he will be performing

03:03.880 --> 03:05.325
"at their annual Corn Festival."

03:05.400 --> 03:06.845
They mentioned the Corn Festival?

03:06.920 --> 03:07.920
Oh, it's national news!

03:07.960 --> 03:09.530
Seriously? That's great.

03:09.800 --> 03:12.041
Yeah. The phone's been
ringing off the hook here at the motel.

03:12.120 --> 03:14.122
Gonna have to get out
the inflatable hangars.

03:14.200 --> 03:16.441
Oh, yeah, everybody
wants to see you, Dusty.

03:16.520 --> 03:18.045
It's gonna be the biggest Corn Fest yet.

03:18.120 --> 03:19.121
Dusty.

03:20.240 --> 03:22.561
- Ready to do some flying?
- Absolutely, Skipper.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.523
- Don't stay out too late.
- Later, Dust.

03:24.640 --> 03:26.369
Remember to open your eyes.

03:28.440 --> 03:30.841
<i>Hey, Propwash Tower,
this is Crophopper Seven.</i>

03:30.920 --> 03:32.604
<i>Flight of two, ready for takeoff.</i>

03:32.680 --> 03:34.250
Crophopper Seven, Propwash Tower.

03:34.480 --> 03:36.801
<i>Wind's calm. Runway
two-seven clear for takeoff.</i>

03:37.040 --> 03:38.769
<i>Have a great flight, fellas.</i>

03:43.520 --> 03:45.443
<i>Crophopper Seven flight, on the roll.</i>

04:17.480 --> 04:18.720
<i>Snap into those turns.</i>

04:20.040 --> 04:21.326
<i>Tighten it up.</i>

04:22.600 --> 04:24.090
<i>There you go.</i>

04:33.360 --> 04:35.761
<i>Now let's work that vertical!</i>

05:06.800 --> 05:07.847
Dusty!

05:08.160 --> 05:10.481
- Dusty, are you okay?
- My engine.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.164
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
steady, there.

05:12.240 --> 05:14.049
Propwash Tower,
this is Jolly Wrench Seven.

05:14.280 --> 05:16.681
We're a flight of two,
five miles north of the airport...

05:16.760 --> 05:18.489
inbound for a precautionary landing.

05:18.560 --> 05:20.289
<i>Roger. Proceed direct to the numbers.</i>

05:20.360 --> 05:22.010
<i>Wind two-seven zero at five.</i>

05:22.080 --> 05:24.003
<i>Runway two-seven clear to land.</i>

05:24.960 --> 05:26.041
I don't know what it was.

05:26.120 --> 05:27.485
I wasn't doing anything different.

05:27.560 --> 05:30.450
Pylon turns, a vertical,
like we do every day.

05:30.520 --> 05:31.681
I feel great now, but...

05:31.760 --> 05:34.366
I got a love-hate relationship
with you, Dusty.

05:34.440 --> 05:37.330
Love that you're my best customer,
hate what you're doing to yourself.

05:37.440 --> 05:39.727
Come on, Dot. You saw me
at the Red Bulldozer race.

05:39.800 --> 05:41.080
I kicked Aston Martin out there!

05:41.120 --> 05:42.360
You're not even listening
to what I'm saying.

05:42.440 --> 05:44.761
And hey, Speed City Airfest
is just a few weeks away.

05:44.840 --> 05:48.447
And I think, if I get a little more speed
coming out of my turns,

05:48.520 --> 05:51.285
really work that radial-G,
I can definitely improve my time.

05:51.360 --> 05:52.600
Yeah, I'm feeling it.

05:52.680 --> 05:54.682
I'm feeling good about my next race.

05:54.880 --> 05:56.769
Well, no damage to the casing
or compressor blades.

05:56.840 --> 05:59.286
See? I told you. Just a hiccup.

05:59.360 --> 06:01.169
- But there is...
- Dusty! Dusty!

06:01.640 --> 06:03.051
What happened? Are you okay, Dust?

06:03.120 --> 06:04.246
It's okay.

06:04.320 --> 06:06.243
Was it your fuel?
I tested it this morning.

06:06.320 --> 06:07.845
I always take a little sip. Gets me going.

06:07.920 --> 06:09.046
It's okay. I got quite
a little scare there.

06:09.120 --> 06:10.326
- But Dottie here...
- Dusty!

06:10.480 --> 06:12.403
And it's all good news,
gave me the all-clear.

06:12.480 --> 06:14.642
Your reduction gearbox is failing.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.281
My gearbox?

06:16.360 --> 06:19.011
Your chip detector had a cluster
of steel shavings on it.

06:19.080 --> 06:22.004
Flakes from the gears.
That's what caused the trouble.

06:22.080 --> 06:23.206
Well, you could just replace it.

06:23.280 --> 06:24.520
Order a new one from A-G Parts.

06:24.600 --> 06:26.480
It'll be here by the end of the week.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.406
Right?

06:30.040 --> 06:31.166
What?

06:35.520 --> 06:37.329
Your gearbox... It's...

06:39.440 --> 06:43.445
It's out of production.
Long since discontinued.

06:44.200 --> 06:46.601
Can't even remember
the last time I saw one.

06:48.120 --> 06:49.281
But, Dottie...

06:49.360 --> 06:51.567
Come on, can't you just
build Dust a new one?

06:51.680 --> 06:54.968
No. It's too complex. It has to be factory.

06:55.120 --> 06:56.565
Well, I mean, there has...

06:56.640 --> 06:59.041
From now on,
you have to back off the torque.

06:59.120 --> 07:00.565
Keep it under 80 percent.

07:00.640 --> 07:02.165
What? 80 percent?

07:02.240 --> 07:04.242
Dottie, you've got me
cranked up to 140.

07:04.360 --> 07:05.885
I need that to race.

07:05.960 --> 07:07.086
If you push yourself into the red,

07:07.160 --> 07:08.924
- your gearbox will fail.
- No, Dottie!

07:09.000 --> 07:10.286
And then your engine will seize.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.328
- Maybe the test that you did was wrong!
- Dusty, listen!

07:12.400 --> 07:13.401
But I've got a race coming up!

07:13.480 --> 07:14.686
You'll crash!

07:15.480 --> 07:19.166
You push yourself into the red,
you'll crash.

07:19.320 --> 07:22.290
Look, I'm gonna install
a warning light on your panel.

07:22.520 --> 07:23.567
A warning light?

07:23.640 --> 07:26.041
If it comes on, you'll need to pull power.

07:26.360 --> 07:27.441
Slow down.

07:27.600 --> 07:28.886
But, Dottie...

07:29.240 --> 07:30.924
You're saying...

07:31.760 --> 07:35.242
I can't race anymore.

07:37.680 --> 07:39.330
I'm so sorry.

07:53.960 --> 07:56.281
<i>I was making my descent</i>

07:56.360 --> 07:57.725
<i>To the Old "BNA"</i>

07:59.200 --> 08:02.409
<i>At gate number three
Concourse A</i>

08:02.480 --> 08:03.606
Can you believe it?

08:03.680 --> 08:05.523
She left me for a hybrid.

08:05.600 --> 08:07.090
I didn't even hear him coming.

08:07.160 --> 08:10.164
<i>And there I saw a wide-body jet</i>

08:10.240 --> 08:13.403
<i>Make me pitch and yaw</i>

08:13.760 --> 08:18.049
<i>My runway romance
At gate number three</i>

08:18.680 --> 08:20.921
All right, boys, I got three Crudeweisers,

08:21.000 --> 08:23.128
and who ordered the Spruce Goose?

08:23.280 --> 08:24.805
What? It's tangy.

08:24.960 --> 08:27.884
Hey, sugar rims,
you just fall out of a B-17?

08:27.960 --> 08:29.769
'Cause you're da bomb.

08:29.920 --> 08:31.922
- Pickup trucks.
- Mmm-hmm.

08:32.120 --> 08:34.009
Dottie's an excellent mechanic.

08:34.200 --> 08:35.964
You know as well as I,
she wouldn't have said

08:36.039 --> 08:37.769
what she said unless she was sure.

08:37.840 --> 08:39.524
- Hey, Dusty! Dusty!
- Hey, Dusty!

08:39.600 --> 08:40.965
- Dusty, hey!
- There he is.

08:41.080 --> 08:42.570
Dust, listen, we just got off the radio

08:42.640 --> 08:43.799
with Ethan up in Grand Flaps.

08:43.840 --> 08:45.001
Old "Grand Flaps Ethan."

08:45.200 --> 08:46.247
He's got the gearbox?

08:47.440 --> 08:48.441
No.

08:48.600 --> 08:49.840
But his buddy owns

08:49.920 --> 08:51.285
- 21 service hangars.
- 21!

08:51.360 --> 08:53.647
Twenty-one of them,
and he's gonna check his inventory,

08:53.760 --> 08:55.285
and he's gonna put the word
out for you, Duster.

08:55.360 --> 08:56.521
- It's a good start, right?
- Oh, yeah!

08:56.600 --> 08:57.726
It's a great start! Can you believe it?

08:57.800 --> 09:00.724
Because if that gearbox is out there,
we're gonna find it for you, buddy.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.800
And, hey, if you don't, it's all right.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.962
- Because the answer is "Yes."
- "Yes?"

09:05.040 --> 09:06.041
- What?
- Yes?

09:06.120 --> 09:07.121
Huh?

09:07.200 --> 09:09.043
Yes, of course you can
have your old job back.

09:09.120 --> 09:10.167
Don't even have to bother asking.

09:10.240 --> 09:11.561
That's just the kind of guy I am.

09:11.600 --> 09:13.523
Leadbottom,
I'm sure Dusty appreciates your offer...

09:13.600 --> 09:15.329
Of course, you got to
start back at minimum wage,

09:15.400 --> 09:16.401
and you lost all your vacation time,

09:16.480 --> 09:17.606
gotta go through orientation again.

09:17.680 --> 09:18.727
Leadbottom, please!

09:18.800 --> 09:20.564
Once you acquire
the taste for Vitaminamulch,

09:20.640 --> 09:21.880
you can't live without it.

09:21.960 --> 09:24.884
It's like Mama's jalapeño chili. Spicy.

09:26.200 --> 09:27.406
Twice!

09:27.480 --> 09:28.891
It's just that now is not the best time.

09:28.960 --> 09:30.246
Come on, Skipper.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.482
I can get his old sprayer back
from that Germany place.

09:32.560 --> 09:34.961
Have it cleaned up and bolted
back on him in no time.

09:35.640 --> 09:38.007
I'll tell you what,
let me buy you a can of oil.

09:38.080 --> 09:39.081
I'll tell you what,

09:39.160 --> 09:41.401
Dusty is the best duster
I've ever known.

09:41.480 --> 09:43.209
And I'm telling you
that Dusty don't crop dust no more.

09:43.280 --> 09:44.281
That's right, no more!

09:44.360 --> 09:45.566
- He's a racer.
- A racer!

09:45.640 --> 09:46.641
He's gonna be back
to racing in no time.

09:46.720 --> 09:47.721
In no time!

09:47.800 --> 09:49.484
- Right, Dusty?
- Right, Dust?

09:49.560 --> 09:50.561
Dust?

10:22.160 --> 10:24.003
Agh!

10:24.080 --> 10:25.286
Argh!

10:33.440 --> 10:34.566
Uh!

10:44.360 --> 10:45.646
Ugh!

10:54.200 --> 10:55.884
Fire. Fire!

10:56.000 --> 10:57.001
Somebody get some help!

10:57.080 --> 10:58.286
The Fill 'n Fly!

10:58.360 --> 11:00.601
- I'll go get Mayday.
- I'll hit the shut-off valve.

11:04.040 --> 11:05.644
Oh, I'm on it!

11:10.240 --> 11:12.242
Had to get my glasses.

11:18.120 --> 11:19.167
Now, listen up!

11:19.440 --> 11:21.681
We gotta cool this down
before it spreads.

11:25.440 --> 11:26.487
Oh. Yeah!

11:29.320 --> 11:30.321
Uh?

11:32.440 --> 11:33.930
Whoa!

11:34.000 --> 11:35.684
- I got you.
- Thanks.

11:41.800 --> 11:42.801
Now what?

11:46.160 --> 11:47.650
I'm gonna need some help.

11:52.200 --> 11:53.281
Now, pull!

11:55.320 --> 11:56.845
Pull!

12:43.760 --> 12:46.047
<i>“TMST”?</i>

12:46.400 --> 12:48.528
"This Means Serious Trouble."

12:49.080 --> 12:51.128
"Transportation Management
Safety Team."

12:51.440 --> 12:54.125
Mr. Mayday, were you
at the specified point of attack,

12:54.200 --> 12:55.486
and applying an extinguishing agent

12:55.560 --> 12:57.289
within three minutes
from the time of alarm?

12:57.960 --> 12:59.246
Well, I...

12:59.360 --> 13:02.250
I didn't have time to look at a clock.

13:03.600 --> 13:05.967
Is that guy writing down
everything I say?

13:07.200 --> 13:09.089
- Yes.
- Well, I...

13:09.640 --> 13:11.210
- So he just wrote that down?
- Yes.

13:11.280 --> 13:14.124
- And that?
- Yes.

13:14.680 --> 13:15.681
Oh.

13:16.760 --> 13:18.683
Can you provide me
with your self-inspection records

13:18.760 --> 13:19.841
and emergency procedure plans?

13:19.920 --> 13:23.925
Oh, look, now, we don't have
many emergencies around here.

13:24.240 --> 13:26.686
Besides, we did get the fire out.

13:26.760 --> 13:29.491
Is that your contingency plan,
Mr. Mayday?

13:29.560 --> 13:32.166
Every time there's an incident,
you topple a water tower?

13:32.240 --> 13:33.240
This was my fault.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.361
Hmm?

13:34.440 --> 13:35.805
I clipped the tower.

13:36.240 --> 13:38.368
I flew out last night because I...

13:39.760 --> 13:40.761
Dusty.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.724
It was an accident.

13:43.600 --> 13:46.171
It's clear this airport
has no plans for an emergency,

13:46.240 --> 13:48.163
and equipment from last century.

13:48.240 --> 13:50.686
So, unless Mr. Mayday
gets refurbished,

13:50.760 --> 13:52.683
and acquires a second
fire-fighting vehicle

13:52.760 --> 13:55.161
in accordance with CFR title 14,
volume three,

13:55.240 --> 13:58.687
chapter one, section 139,
sub-paragraph B,

13:58.840 --> 14:01.002
I am pulling this airport's
certificate of operation

14:01.080 --> 14:03.924
for non-compliance of rescue
and fire-fighting regulations.

14:04.280 --> 14:05.611
Oh, Chevy.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.930
Propwash Junction just got shut down?

14:09.000 --> 14:10.720
With no active runway,
how can anybody land?

14:10.760 --> 14:11.841
They can't. That's the problem.

14:11.920 --> 14:13.570
There goes the Corn Festival.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.843
But I already finished
my corncob costume.

14:15.920 --> 14:17.570
Now, everybody, calm down.

14:17.640 --> 14:18.766
- Calm down?
- Calm down.

14:18.840 --> 14:20.410
Calm down? Motel's booked.

14:20.480 --> 14:23.165
This Corn Festival
is what butters my corn.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.442
Brodi, we've already figured this out.

14:25.520 --> 14:26.965
Dottie, show them.

14:28.280 --> 14:29.725
This is Mayday now.

14:29.800 --> 14:30.881
I did the drawings.

14:30.960 --> 14:34.726
We add a new 400-watt siren,
a 2,000 GPM roof turret,

14:34.800 --> 14:37.644
a high-capacity water tank
with integrated class A foam cell,

14:37.720 --> 14:39.722
and we'll have an all-new Mayday.

14:39.800 --> 14:41.882
Get out! He gets rocket boosters?

14:41.960 --> 14:45.806
That's right. Fuelled by good old
hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide.

14:45.880 --> 14:47.644
Of course, remember,
that stuff is highly explosive,

14:47.720 --> 14:49.882
so you'll want to keep it away
from any open flames.

14:49.960 --> 14:51.803
But he's a fire truck.

14:51.880 --> 14:53.325
Exactly. Go on, Dottie.

14:53.400 --> 14:57.564
So, for Mayday to keep his job
and get Propwash reopened,

14:57.640 --> 15:01.326
we just need to find a second firefighter.

15:01.480 --> 15:03.881
What? At this time of year?
It's fire season.

15:03.960 --> 15:05.640
How much is another
firefighter gonna cost?

15:05.680 --> 15:07.648
I'll tell you how much. Too much!

15:07.760 --> 15:09.922
If we hire one, we might as well hire two.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.809
Oh, for crying out loud.

15:11.880 --> 15:14.690
Gee, this tarmac is getting awful hot.

15:35.680 --> 15:37.170
Knock, knock.

15:37.240 --> 15:38.844
Oh.

15:39.440 --> 15:41.363
Hey, Dusty.

15:42.720 --> 15:44.006
I just...

15:44.680 --> 15:45.886
Hmm.

15:45.960 --> 15:47.803
I wish there was, uh...

15:48.280 --> 15:50.886
You know, I wish there was
something I could do.

15:51.520 --> 15:54.251
Oh, there's nothing. It's all right.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.883
I'm old, Dusty.

15:59.720 --> 16:02.326
Looks like my firefighting days are over.

16:02.400 --> 16:03.481
Uh, no.

16:03.560 --> 16:04.641
No, Mayday.

16:04.720 --> 16:07.121
Look, there's still plenty
of firefight left in you.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.200
Look at...

16:08.240 --> 16:11.084
I mean, right here,
"Firefighter of the Year."

16:11.560 --> 16:13.608
Huh, 1968.

16:13.760 --> 16:16.240
Okay. Your Bronze Star.

16:16.400 --> 16:18.243
Old and tarnished.

16:19.320 --> 16:21.004
Like me.

16:25.600 --> 16:26.601
<i>Oh.</i>

16:27.320 --> 16:30.005
Is this you and an old crop duster?

16:30.320 --> 16:32.482
- Hmm?
- This one, right here.

16:32.560 --> 16:34.164
Oh, yeah.

16:34.320 --> 16:36.926
Mendocino, 1956.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.003
Oh, '55, '55.

16:39.160 --> 16:42.243
Yeah, I was there. Yeah, I was there.

16:42.400 --> 16:45.722
I got to witness
one of the very first aerial firefighters.

16:45.800 --> 16:48.406
- Oh.
- Nowadays known as a "SEAT."

16:48.480 --> 16:49.686
<i>A “SEAT”?</i>

16:49.760 --> 16:51.444
Yeah. A "Single Engine Air Tanker."

16:51.520 --> 16:52.521
<i>Huh.</i>

16:52.600 --> 16:54.568
You see, instead of dusting crops,

16:55.440 --> 16:57.602
you know, like you used to do,

16:57.680 --> 16:58.727
they drop water.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.041
- Wow.
- Yeah.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.646
Uh, Mayday?

17:07.119 --> 17:08.121
Mmm-hmm?

17:10.200 --> 17:14.364
What if I became our second firefighter?

17:15.119 --> 17:16.121
You?

17:16.280 --> 17:18.169
Yeah. Dottie will fix you up,

17:18.240 --> 17:19.651
and I'll get certified.

17:20.960 --> 17:22.848
What about your racing?

17:23.000 --> 17:25.890
Look. Right now, we need
to get Propwash reopened.

17:26.040 --> 17:27.280
Me...

17:27.839 --> 17:29.285
And you.

17:30.880 --> 17:33.121
I don't know what to say.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.645
Thanks, Dusty.

17:41.160 --> 17:44.846
One, two, three, lil' jon-jon, and five.

17:45.040 --> 17:47.646
Okay, that's it. That's the morning rush.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.689
Highway's all clear, Duster.

17:49.880 --> 17:51.769
Now, when you get
to Piston Peak Air Attack,

17:51.880 --> 17:53.723
you're gonna ask for Blade Ranger.

17:53.840 --> 17:54.921
Blade Ranger.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.081
You got it. Yeah.

17:56.160 --> 17:57.600
He's their Chief of Fire and Rescue.

17:57.640 --> 17:59.085
He's an old friend of mine.

17:59.160 --> 18:01.083
He can train and certify you.

18:01.160 --> 18:02.730
Consider it done, Mayday.

18:02.880 --> 18:05.565
And, Dusty, be careful.

18:05.720 --> 18:07.006
I will.

18:08.600 --> 18:10.045
Good luck, Dusty!

18:10.200 --> 18:11.770
Take it easy out there!

18:11.920 --> 18:13.365
You can do it, Dusty.

18:13.520 --> 18:15.045
We're proud of you, pal!

18:15.160 --> 18:17.447
Good luck!

18:18.200 --> 18:20.851
<i>There's a time</i>

18:22.000 --> 18:24.685
<i>In your life</i>

18:25.760 --> 18:28.127
<i>When the world</i>

18:29.200 --> 18:31.282
<i>ls on your side</i>

18:33.040 --> 18:36.522
<i>You might not feel it</i>

18:36.960 --> 18:40.521
<i>You might not see it</i>

18:40.920 --> 18:44.811
<i>But it surrounds you
like a light</i>

18:44.960 --> 18:49.602
<i>Makes you stronger
for the fight</i>

18:50.080 --> 18:53.880
<i>Never letting go
Gotta learn to grow</i>

18:54.040 --> 18:58.602
<i>Watch me as I touch the sky</i>

18:59.120 --> 19:02.602
<i>sun I fly</i>

19:04.240 --> 19:07.323
<i>Now I know it's what I gotta do</i>

19:07.400 --> 19:09.402
<i>Find a dream that's new</i>

19:09.560 --> 19:14.407
<i>Give it all I got this time</i>

19:14.560 --> 19:17.325
<i>sun I fly</i>

19:20.840 --> 19:24.481
Oh, Harvey, it's just like I remember.

19:24.680 --> 19:27.490
Winnie, how many pairs
of tires did you pack?

19:27.600 --> 19:29.489
Harvey, you spoiled it.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.250
Now you spoiled the moment.

19:37.600 --> 19:41.286
<i>Breathe it in I'm gonna shine</i>

19:41.440 --> 19:45.126
<i>It's my moment
Gotta live it, live it right</i>

19:45.280 --> 19:49.604
<i>I'm flying Flying so strong</i>

19:50.160 --> 19:51.571
Hello! Welcome, guests,

19:51.640 --> 19:55.326
to the grand reopening weekend
of the magnificent Fusel Lodge!

19:56.280 --> 19:57.930
Ah, we're gonna wipe off
those muddy tires, aren't we?

19:58.000 --> 19:59.240
Yes, we are.

19:59.320 --> 20:01.288
Oh! Good heavens!
Look who we have here!

20:01.960 --> 20:05.407
<i>Never letting go
Gotta learn to grow</i>

20:05.840 --> 20:10.004
<i>Watch me as I touch the sky</i>

20:10.160 --> 20:15.412
<i>Oh Still I fly sun I fly</i>

20:57.840 --> 21:00.446
Argh! Stick shift!

21:05.720 --> 21:07.324
- Ripping!
- Whoa!

21:07.400 --> 21:08.970
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

21:09.040 --> 21:10.929
Drip, what the heck
is the matter with you?

21:11.000 --> 21:12.286
You nearly took off the guy's canopy!

21:12.360 --> 21:14.362
But Blackout said
it was okay to go, dude.

21:14.480 --> 21:15.481
- I did?
- He did?

21:15.560 --> 21:17.483
Yeah, he was like,
"He's okay to go, dude."

21:17.560 --> 21:18.891
- Hmm.
- Uh, I'm sorry.

21:19.040 --> 21:20.166
I know you're busy,

21:20.240 --> 21:22.481
but I am looking
for Piston Peak Air Attack.

21:22.560 --> 21:23.607
You are there!

21:23.680 --> 21:25.170
Copy that, jefe-

21:25.880 --> 21:29.726
Serving beautiful Vee-Six Valley
since 1958.

21:29.880 --> 21:31.723
You must be the SEAT. Hmm.

21:31.880 --> 21:33.166
We heard you were coming.

21:33.240 --> 21:35.242
I'm Dynamite. This is Blackout,

21:35.360 --> 21:37.169
- Pinecone, Avalanche...
- Hello!

21:37.240 --> 21:39.641
And Evel Kenumbskull
over there is Drip.

21:39.720 --> 21:41.085
Did you guys see that?

21:41.160 --> 21:43.208
Hey, guys, what's up?
I'm Dusty Crophopper.

21:43.320 --> 21:45.971
Dusty Crophopper? Dusty Crophopper!

21:46.040 --> 21:47.201
Go, go, go, go, go!

21:47.280 --> 21:48.805
- The air racer?
- Uh, hi.

21:48.880 --> 21:50.530
Shut the hangar door!

21:50.680 --> 21:51.806
I'm your biggest fan!

21:51.880 --> 21:53.848
I have seen every single
one of your races on RSN.

21:53.920 --> 21:55.001
Wow!

21:55.080 --> 21:56.366
You're smaller than I thought,
but that's okay.

21:56.440 --> 21:57.487
Um, thanks.

21:57.560 --> 22:00.689
So, what is a world-famous
racing superstar doing here?

22:00.760 --> 22:01.886
Um... Um, well...

22:01.960 --> 22:04.327
I'm here because
I'm between races right now,

22:04.400 --> 22:06.004
so I'm helping out some friends...

22:06.080 --> 22:08.208
- Oh, that's so sweet!
- Back home.

22:08.280 --> 22:09.486
I'm Dipper.
That's what everyone calls me,

22:09.560 --> 22:10.891
So you can, too.

22:11.040 --> 22:12.166
- Okay, Mrs...
- "Miss."

22:12.240 --> 22:13.480
- Miss.
- Miss, yeah.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.409
- Dipper. Yep-
- Dipper. Yep-.

22:15.560 --> 22:16.971
<i>Rarr!</i>

22:18.240 --> 22:19.321
It was great to meet you.

22:19.440 --> 22:21.249
I'm looking for Blade Ranger.

22:21.440 --> 22:23.840
He's out scouting for spot fires.
He should be back in a few.

22:23.880 --> 22:24.880
Thanks.

22:24.920 --> 22:26.524
The one the Lakota call Haokah

22:26.600 --> 22:29.251
beats his drum
with the wind to make thunder.

22:29.720 --> 22:35.170
With thunder comes lightning,
and with lightning comes fire.

22:37.240 --> 22:39.641
Okay.

22:39.760 --> 22:41.205
Yeah, very nice.

22:41.280 --> 22:43.521
Windlifter, stop scaring our guest.

22:43.600 --> 22:44.681
I don't hear any drums.

22:44.800 --> 22:45.847
<i>Kilawu.</i>

22:48.280 --> 22:51.045
<i>All aircraft,
we've got a report of a wildfire.</i>

22:51.120 --> 22:53.043
Come on, boys, let's load up!

22:53.120 --> 22:55.009
Patch, drop the needle!

22:58.640 --> 22:59.846
It's an actual fire?

22:59.920 --> 23:01.729
Yeah. It happens all the time.

23:01.800 --> 23:03.484
You guys only hear about the big ones.

23:04.360 --> 23:06.647
<i>Fire is due to an unattended campfire.</i>

23:06.800 --> 23:10.805
<i>Location, 10 clicks northwest,
heading two-niner-seven.</i>

23:10.960 --> 23:11.960
<i>Slow rate of spread.</i>

23:12.000 --> 23:14.446
<i>Ten acres with a northerly wind on it.</i>

23:46.720 --> 23:48.529
I gotta see this.

23:54.840 --> 23:56.490
Thar she burns, fellas!

24:25.200 --> 24:26.725
Whoa!

24:29.400 --> 24:31.801
<i>All right, mud droppers,
watch your altitude.</i>

24:31.880 --> 24:33.530
<i>Too low, and you'll spread the embers.</i>

24:33.600 --> 24:35.967
<i>Dipper, set up for a drop
and vee the head of the fire.</i>

24:36.040 --> 24:37.883
Copy that. I'm away.

24:48.200 --> 24:49.920
<i>Windlifter, you're clear to maneuver.</i>

24:50.120 --> 24:52.088
Windlifter copies.

24:57.360 --> 24:58.486
<i>All right, Cabbie...</i>

24:58.600 --> 25:00.045
<i>Let's get some wheels on the ground.</i>

25:00.160 --> 25:02.162
Jumpers, South Meadow looks clear.

25:02.240 --> 25:05.449
Should put you approximately
100 yards below the fire.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.245
Looks good, Cabbie.

25:08.560 --> 25:10.927
Let's ride the silk elevator, boys.

25:11.080 --> 25:12.605
I will never understand

25:12.680 --> 25:14.682
why you gravel crunchers want to jump

25:14.760 --> 25:16.683
out of a perfectly good airplane.

25:16.760 --> 25:19.206
We're not. We're jumping out of you!

25:35.760 --> 25:36.761
Ha!

25:37.440 --> 25:39.204
Everyone's down. We're good.

25:39.280 --> 25:41.601
<i>Cabbie copies. Be careful out there.</i>

25:41.760 --> 25:43.285
Dynamite, use that creek bed

25:43.360 --> 25:45.567
as a natural barrier to create a firebreak.

25:45.640 --> 25:47.881
All right, jumpers,
let's anchor into the bed

25:47.960 --> 25:50.281
and start building a line.

26:21.160 --> 26:22.491
Awesome!

26:30.000 --> 26:32.844
Who the... Get out
of this air space!

26:33.120 --> 26:34.770
Oh, sorry. Sorry!

26:38.360 --> 26:39.441
Oh-oh.

26:45.480 --> 26:46.686
Ah. That ought to do it.

26:46.760 --> 26:48.603
Well, back to work.

26:48.680 --> 26:51.160
I gotta mix up a fresh batch of retardant.

26:51.320 --> 26:53.368
Once you dry out,
you can wing it on back

26:53.440 --> 26:55.283
to the lodge with the rest of the tourists.

26:55.440 --> 26:58.091
I'm not a tourist.
Actually, I'm the guy that May...

26:58.160 --> 26:59.889
He's the trainee.

27:01.360 --> 27:03.761
You're the SEAT
Mayday radioed about?

27:03.840 --> 27:05.285
- Oh, for the love of...
- Come on, Blade.

27:05.360 --> 27:06.361
He's not just some SEAT.

27:06.480 --> 27:07.480
No, no, no.

27:07.560 --> 27:09.289
Seriously. It's Dusty Crophopper,

27:09.360 --> 27:10.964
the champion air racer.

27:11.040 --> 27:12.565
"Champion."
Don't be shy. Come on!

27:12.680 --> 27:13.727
Tell him!

27:13.800 --> 27:14.801
No big deal.

27:14.880 --> 27:17.884
He raced all the way around the world!

27:19.320 --> 27:21.561
I did. I did do that.

27:23.240 --> 27:27.370
The world wasn't on fire though, was it?

27:28.720 --> 27:32.725
Was the whole world on fire?

27:34.400 --> 27:35.401
No.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.001
Hmm.

27:37.240 --> 27:38.287
Maru!

27:38.560 --> 27:39.561
What?

27:39.640 --> 27:40.926
Rip off his landing gear.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.001
Wait, what?

27:47.760 --> 27:51.401
<i>Muskrat, muskrat candlelight</i>

27:51.600 --> 27:54.126
it feels pretty weird
without the tip tanks.

27:54.200 --> 27:55.440
Tip tanks?

27:55.520 --> 27:57.170
You couldn't exactly go flying into fire

27:57.240 --> 27:58.685
with fuel tanks on your wings.

27:58.760 --> 28:00.364
Kaboom!

28:00.440 --> 28:03.444
Nope. You're gonna need
these pontoons.

28:03.520 --> 28:04.806
- They may be old...
- Old?

28:04.880 --> 28:06.530
But they'll let you
scoop water right off the lake.

28:06.600 --> 28:08.284
You're goofing on me.
Do you have any new ones?

28:08.360 --> 28:09.600
New?

28:10.280 --> 28:12.647
We don't even know what that
word means around here.

28:12.720 --> 28:15.041
I rebuilt these babies myself.

28:15.200 --> 28:16.361
They're better than new.

28:16.440 --> 28:17.885
- Give them a go.
- Huh?

28:17.960 --> 28:20.691
All right. Let me just get this...

28:23.760 --> 28:25.808
Pop the wheels, genius.

28:25.880 --> 28:27.803
The whee... Yeah. Pop the wheels.

28:28.640 --> 28:29.641
On.

28:29.760 --> 28:31.410
- That's it.
- Yeah, you think?

28:31.600 --> 28:32.840
Yeah, I'm tall. Look at this.

28:34.280 --> 28:36.282
Hey, you guys have a wall of fame

28:36.440 --> 28:38.090
just like the Jolly Wrenches.

28:38.240 --> 28:39.401
So, what's the deal?

28:39.480 --> 28:41.480
What do you have to do
to get your picture up here?

28:42.920 --> 28:44.331
Crash.

28:44.440 --> 28:45.487
Oh.

28:45.640 --> 28:48.371
Yeah, it's dangerous work,

28:48.440 --> 28:50.920
but that's the job of a firefighter.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.322
Risking their lives for people
they don't even know.

28:55.480 --> 28:57.801
They fly in when others are flying out.

28:59.160 --> 29:01.003
It takes a special kind of plane.

29:03.160 --> 29:05.481
Fighting wildfire means flying low.

29:05.560 --> 29:08.325
And that's why
we have Augerin Canyon,

29:08.400 --> 29:10.687
our own little obstacle course.

29:10.760 --> 29:12.330
All you gotta do is stay below the rim,

29:12.400 --> 29:13.731
and when you get to the bridge,

29:13.800 --> 29:15.165
fly under and pull out.

29:15.440 --> 29:17.283
Flying low. No problem.

29:17.520 --> 29:18.681
Overconfidence,

29:18.800 --> 29:21.531
the kind of attitude
that can get you killed.

29:31.760 --> 29:34.206
Okay, now, let's see you
make it under that bridge.

29:38.520 --> 29:41.091
Why did you pull power?
You gotta firewall it.

29:41.160 --> 29:42.889
The bridge, it's too close to the falls.

29:42.960 --> 29:44.041
<i>No excuses.</i>

29:44.120 --> 29:45.884
<i>If there had been a downdraft,
you'd be dead.</i>

29:47.680 --> 29:49.205
<i>Make a normal seaplane approach.</i>

29:49.280 --> 29:50.281
<i>Stay on the step</i>

29:50.360 --> 29:52.044
<i>while collecting water
through the scoops.</i>

29:52.120 --> 29:53.281
<i>Just like that.</i>

29:53.360 --> 29:54.361
<i>Climb out loaded,</i>

29:54.440 --> 29:56.044
<i>return to your holding orbit,
and drop as directed.</i>

29:56.120 --> 29:57.121
<i>Copy that?</i>

29:57.200 --> 29:58.201
Copy that.

29:59.040 --> 30:01.247
<i>Okay, you've got
12 to 15 seconds to scoop...</i>

30:01.360 --> 30:02.885
<i>Then 50 feet to climb out.</i>

30:03.000 --> 30:04.411
<i>And watch out for the tree!</i>

30:04.880 --> 30:07.406
Indirect attack,
parallel attack, direct attack.

30:07.480 --> 30:09.403
Know what your fire is doing
at all times.

30:09.480 --> 30:10.481
Wind speed and direction.

30:10.560 --> 30:11.891
Temperature, relative humidity.

30:11.960 --> 30:13.883
And finally, all aircraft
must be on the ground

30:14.040 --> 30:15.565
30 minutes after sunset.

30:15.720 --> 30:17.563
Flying low at night is the fastest way

30:17.640 --> 30:19.085
to get your picture on the wall.

30:23.040 --> 30:24.041
Too early.

30:25.400 --> 30:26.401
Too high!

30:28.400 --> 30:29.481
Too low.

30:29.840 --> 30:33.162
<i>Those crops of yours, they die a lot?</i>

30:42.880 --> 30:44.006
<i>Approach looks good.</i>

30:44.160 --> 30:46.049
<i>Now, increase your air speed.</i>

30:46.200 --> 30:47.281
<i>Redline it.</i>

30:47.360 --> 30:48.600
<i>Go to max torque.</i>

30:48.680 --> 30:49.681
<i>Don't back off.</i>

30:51.200 --> 30:52.247
<i>Don't back off!</i>

30:52.560 --> 30:54.449
Oh, why did you bail out again?

30:54.600 --> 30:56.284
If you don't push it,
you're not gonna make it

30:56.400 --> 30:57.640
and you won't be certified.

31:09.040 --> 31:10.121
Good job!

31:10.280 --> 31:13.045
You just saved those folks
from a nice vacation.

31:14.800 --> 31:16.370
<i>Propwash Junction to Dusty.</i>

31:16.760 --> 31:19.491
<i>Come in, Dusty.
Propwash Junction to Dusty.</i>

31:19.560 --> 31:20.561
Hey. Skipper.

31:20.640 --> 31:21.801
<i>Hey! How's it going?</i>

31:21.920 --> 31:23.490
This is tougher than I thought,

31:23.600 --> 31:25.489
but it is so good to hear from you.

31:25.560 --> 31:26.561
<i>Well, we wanted to radio...</i>

31:26.640 --> 31:27.880
Skip, let me tell him.

31:27.960 --> 31:29.041
Oh, all right, Chug.

31:29.120 --> 31:30.246
- Tell me what?
- Okay.

31:30.320 --> 31:33.241
That We... Oh, I can't!

31:33.320 --> 31:34.367
You tell him, Sparky.

31:34.440 --> 31:35.487
Uh, Well.

31:35.560 --> 31:36.971
<i>So, okay, there's this fella
out in California.</i>

31:37.120 --> 31:38.246
<i>California!</i>

31:38.320 --> 31:39.401
The Skipper and I know him from back

31:39.480 --> 31:40.811
when we were stationed in Coronado.

31:40.880 --> 31:41.927
Near San Diego!

31:42.000 --> 31:43.240
We all used to go down to Baja.

31:43.320 --> 31:44.481
Near Coronado!

31:44.720 --> 31:48.008
<i>Oh, boy, there was this one time
we went to this bar,</i>

31:48.120 --> 31:50.930
<i>and Skipper put a hula skirt
and coconuts on his...</i>

31:51.000 --> 31:52.968
<i>- Sparky!
- Right, okay. Sony. Sony.</i>

31:53.080 --> 31:54.889
The point is, he has one of your...

31:54.960 --> 31:55.960
Gearboxes!

31:56.000 --> 31:57.047
We got the gearbox!

31:57.160 --> 31:59.401
You got the... You got the...
Are you kidding me?

31:59.520 --> 32:00.760
Oh, wait. It gets better.

32:00.840 --> 32:02.683
He's going to ship it out tonight.

32:02.760 --> 32:04.603
We'll have it in a couple of days!

32:04.680 --> 32:05.681
This is the best news.

32:05.800 --> 32:07.245
This is just what
I needed to hear right now.

32:07.360 --> 32:08.961
We'll let you know as soon as we get it.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.686
Hey, Dusty! Listen to my new siren.

32:22.480 --> 32:23.970
Huh?

32:24.120 --> 32:26.771
<i>Yeah, I haven't actually</i>

32:26.880 --> 32:28.882
<i>hooked up his siren yet.</i>

32:29.520 --> 32:31.284
<i>All aircraft, be advised...</i>

32:31.360 --> 32:33.886
Something's up. I gotta go, guys.

32:34.040 --> 32:35.644
<i>I repeat, Superintendent Spinner</i>

32:35.720 --> 32:37.051
<i>has entered the base.</i>

32:37.520 --> 32:38.646
What's going on?

32:39.040 --> 32:40.644
Park superintendent.

32:40.800 --> 32:43.371
He waxes himself... daily.

32:44.840 --> 32:46.080
Honk, honk! Beep-beep!

32:46.160 --> 32:47.286
Park superintendent coming.

32:47.400 --> 32:49.323
I sign your paychecks.
Anybody gonna greet me?

32:49.400 --> 32:50.401
Yes, you are!

32:50.520 --> 32:51.646
I got some oil pans to change.

32:51.720 --> 32:53.802
Blade, Blade, Blade.

32:53.880 --> 32:54.961
What do you want, Cad?

32:55.040 --> 32:56.530
That's a big hill. Listen.

32:56.600 --> 32:57.886
Do you think I like driving all around

32:57.960 --> 32:59.724
over here and up there,
over there just to complain?

32:59.800 --> 33:01.165
Answer... No, I don't.

33:01.240 --> 33:04.687
But, I heard from some campers
that one of your staff

33:04.840 --> 33:08.003
just soaked them with that red fire
phosphorescent stuff that you use.

33:08.080 --> 33:09.161
The deodorant.

33:09.240 --> 33:11.242
Yeah, I'm sorry.
That was my fault.

33:11.320 --> 33:12.401
The team needs to train.

33:12.480 --> 33:13.641
There's gonna be some mud
spilled along the way.

33:13.760 --> 33:14.841
Are you kidding me?

33:14.920 --> 33:16.570
- No, that's the way it works.
- No, you are not!

33:16.680 --> 33:18.409
Blade, you're hiding
a world famous racer

33:18.480 --> 33:20.323
right here at Piston Peak!

33:20.400 --> 33:22.880
Ripslinger!

33:23.720 --> 33:25.324
Uh, it's "Crophopper."

33:25.440 --> 33:27.329
Crophopper!

33:27.520 --> 33:28.646
- Dusty.
- Yeah, right.

33:28.720 --> 33:31.007
Me, Cad Spinner. You, one fast plane.

33:31.080 --> 33:32.161
What are you doing up here?

33:32.280 --> 33:33.361
- Well, I'm getting...
- Doesn't matter.

33:33.440 --> 33:34.771
Tomorrow night. The lodge.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.689
Grand reopening party. You're invited!

33:36.760 --> 33:37.921
And I'm thinking,

33:38.000 --> 33:39.640
high-speed flyover.
What are you thinking?

33:40.280 --> 33:42.681
I'm thinking it'll be... It'll be dark.

33:43.760 --> 33:45.125
Hey! There's gonna be a lot of VIPs.

33:45.200 --> 33:46.531
"Very Important Planes."

33:46.600 --> 33:47.965
How would you like to rub tires with the

33:48.080 --> 33:50.447
Secretary of the Interior
of the United States

33:50.600 --> 33:51.965
of America?

33:52.120 --> 33:54.043
I smell photo op! Flash! Cha-ching.

33:54.960 --> 33:56.530
I smell something else.

33:56.600 --> 33:57.601
Blade, Blade, Blade.

33:57.720 --> 33:59.006
Can I explain something? Yes, I can.

33:59.080 --> 34:01.367
Look, spilling mud on people
makes for sad campers.

34:01.440 --> 34:03.442
Big party at my lodge
makes for happy campers.

34:03.600 --> 34:04.806
You understand?

34:04.880 --> 34:06.840
You've packed too many
happy campers into the park

34:06.880 --> 34:08.848
and way too many into that lodge.

34:08.920 --> 34:11.047
Oh, we've got a structural fire engine
down there protecting it.

34:11.120 --> 34:12.201
This isn't just about
protecting the lodge.

34:12.320 --> 34:13.400
There's low humidity...

34:13.480 --> 34:16.404
He got the Park Service
to shift 80 percent of our budget

34:16.480 --> 34:18.562
to his lodge restoration project.

34:18.639 --> 34:21.723
This base is held together
with baling wire and duct tape!

34:21.800 --> 34:23.962
Maru had to rebuild
that old tower himself.

34:24.639 --> 34:26.290
It's better than new!

34:26.440 --> 34:29.125
Hear me, fellow forest friends,
dirty though you may be.

34:29.199 --> 34:31.248
This is an historic weekend.

34:31.320 --> 34:33.163
Cad, you got 30 seconds. Go.

34:33.280 --> 34:35.248
Ah, I don't care how much it costs.

34:35.320 --> 34:37.641
Yes, get the crystal glasses.

34:37.760 --> 34:40.047
Yes, fluted! Were you built in a barn?
Come on!

34:40.120 --> 34:41.690
The lodge is only gonna be
grand-reopened once.

34:41.760 --> 34:43.091
I'm not gonna...

34:44.960 --> 34:46.405
Could you hold on a second?

34:48.520 --> 34:49.601
Then fire the old lady,

34:49.679 --> 34:51.762
and get somebody who can get them!

34:52.679 --> 34:54.841
You're not the only ones
who can put out a fire, right?

34:55.920 --> 34:57.763
Will I see you at the party? Yes, I will.

34:58.160 --> 34:59.321
Superstar!

34:59.480 --> 35:01.767
Can you believe it? Dusty Cropslinger!

35:01.840 --> 35:04.605
He's even more famous
than you, Blazin' Blade.

35:04.630 --> 35:06.630
SharePirate.Com-Movie Stream and Downloads

35:08.520 --> 35:09.965
- "Blazin' Blade?"
- Shh!

35:10.040 --> 35:11.087
- What?
- Shh.

35:11.160 --> 35:12.160
- What, me, shush?
- Shh!

35:12.200 --> 35:13.770
- I just said "Blazin' Blade."
- Kilawu!

35:13.880 --> 35:15.006
What?

35:15.600 --> 35:19.207
Tonight. Main hangar.

35:19.360 --> 35:21.362
Tell no one.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.807
Especially Blade.

35:39.360 --> 35:41.727
Password.

35:43.320 --> 35:45.726
Password? You didn't tell me...
Shh!

35:46.160 --> 35:47.810
You didn't tell me a password.

35:48.240 --> 35:50.686
It's "inferno."

35:51.880 --> 35:53.166
Okay.

35:56.040 --> 35:58.088
Oh. Inferno.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.286
Glad you could make it.

36:00.360 --> 36:01.486
You like "inferno"?

36:01.560 --> 36:02.846
It was either that, or "Maelstrom,"

36:02.920 --> 36:04.365
but that was so Nordic.

36:04.760 --> 36:06.250
Park it over here, Dust Storm.

36:06.320 --> 36:10.086
Our first date, and I saved you a spot.

36:13.560 --> 36:15.528
Yeah. They're real.

36:17.240 --> 36:19.686
<i>"Howard The Truck"?
You invited me here</i> to <i>watch...</i>

36:19.760 --> 36:23.685
Dude, dude, dude.
Judge not a video by its cover.

36:28.120 --> 36:30.600
<i>I'm Larry H. Parkinglot,
and I'll fight for you!</i>

36:52.800 --> 36:54.370
Hold on. Blade was a TV star?

36:54.480 --> 36:57.245
139 episodes of law-breaking love.

36:57.360 --> 36:58.361
Quiet!

<i>Good move, partner.</i>

37:00.720 --> 37:02.484

37:03.960 --> 37:05.564
<i>running station wagons
off the road, you punk?</i>

37:05.640 --> 37:06.687
<i>If I had a nickel
for every crook like you...</i>

37:06.760 --> 37:07.760
<i>Hey, hey, hey!</i>

37:07.800 --> 37:08.801
<i>He ain't worth it, Nick.</i>

37:08.920 --> 37:10.649
<i>All units, we have a code 904-S.</i>

37:11.240 --> 37:13.607
<i>Structural fire downtown at Studio 4x4.</i>

37:13.680 --> 37:16.331
<i>L.A. Seven-Mary-Four,
this is Officer Nick Lopez.</i>

37:16.400 --> 37:17.401
<i>We're on it!</i>

37:20.000 --> 37:21.126
<i>Help!</i>

37:21.320 --> 37:22.401
<i>Help!</i>

37:23.480 --> 37:24.811
Hoist!

37:28.160 --> 37:29.650
<i>Are you all right, miss?</i>

37:30.000 --> 37:31.001
<i>Hey, baby.</i>

37:31.120 --> 37:32.690
<i>Ooh, I am now.</i>

37:33.240 --> 37:34.401
Hmm.

37:34.520 --> 37:37.126
<i>As much as it pains me
to say this, you two jokers...</i>

37:38.440 --> 37:40.124
<i>You did a good job.</i>

37:41.480 --> 37:42.925
<i>Nice catch today, Blade.</i>

37:43.000 --> 37:45.082
<i>Speaking of which, she's got a sister.</i>

37:45.160 --> 37:46.286
<i>Hi.</i>

37:46.360 --> 37:47.691
<i>Good move, partner.</i>

37:51.120 --> 37:54.283
Dudes, let's watch episode 38,
"Super Copter"!

37:54.360 --> 37:56.283
"Super Copter"? This show stinks.

37:56.360 --> 37:58.249
What are you talking about?
This show is the best.

37:58.320 --> 37:59.685
I'm with Cabbie.

38:00.200 --> 38:01.850
- Guys? Hey, guys?
- Quiet!

38:01.960 --> 38:03.121
Thanks.

38:03.280 --> 38:04.566
I just don't get something.

38:04.640 --> 38:06.369
If Blade was such a big TV star,

38:06.440 --> 38:07.930
what is he doing here?

38:08.000 --> 38:09.365
- I don't know.
- We don't know!

38:09.440 --> 38:11.920
It's a mysterious mystery.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.685
It's like my fiancé.
He just vanished. Poof!

38:15.800 --> 38:17.962
From my experience,
this kind of stuff is classified.

38:18.040 --> 38:19.041
Black ops!

38:19.120 --> 38:20.406
I heard he went cuckoo on the set.

38:20.480 --> 38:21.481
You know, probably top secret.

38:21.560 --> 38:22.561
CIA!

38:22.680 --> 38:23.647
- I'm sure he could tell us.
- Yes!

38:23.720 --> 38:25.370
- But he'd have to kill us.
- I don't want to die!

38:25.520 --> 38:26.965
Whatever the reason is,

38:27.040 --> 38:30.840
it's his business, and we're not asking.

38:37.560 --> 38:40.530
<i>All aircraft and jumpers,
lightning storm came through.</i>

38:40.720 --> 38:42.449
We've got multiple starts

38:42.520 --> 38:45.000
<i>north of Skyline Drive,
east of Coil Springs.</i>

38:45.920 --> 38:47.763
Lightning storm started
a whole slew of spot fires

38:47.840 --> 38:49.001
and they've merged.

38:49.080 --> 38:50.366
This is a big one.

38:50.560 --> 38:53.131
<i>Winds are out of the southwest
with a moderate rate of spread.</i>

38:55.400 --> 38:56.401
Rapid.

38:56.600 --> 38:59.331
<i>Wait. We have an update.
Rapid rate of spread.</i>

38:59.440 --> 39:01.249
Dipper, you and Windlifter load up.

39:01.320 --> 39:03.004
- Champ, wait in the hangar.
- What?

39:03.080 --> 39:04.923
Blade, Dusty's been practicing so hard.

39:05.080 --> 39:06.684
- This ain't no campfire.
- Come on, I can do this.

39:06.760 --> 39:08.125
- You're not certified.
- Just give him a shot.

39:08.240 --> 39:09.321
He's not certified!

39:09.400 --> 39:12.085
We need every plane we've got.

39:13.120 --> 39:14.565
I want to help.

39:17.280 --> 39:18.281
Maru!

39:18.440 --> 39:19.441
Yeah, Blade?

39:19.960 --> 39:20.961
Load him up.

39:21.080 --> 39:22.764
Okay!

39:26.240 --> 39:27.366
What was that for?

39:28.080 --> 39:29.491
The wall.

39:40.880 --> 39:42.120
<i>Dipper, move into position.</i>

39:42.200 --> 39:43.964
<i>Split load. Coverage level eight.</i>

39:44.040 --> 39:45.201
<i>Dipper copies.</i>

39:46.800 --> 39:49.087
<i>Come left one wingspan
on your next drop.</i>

39:49.280 --> 39:51.044
Champ, tag on and extend.

39:51.120 --> 39:52.804
<i>- Split load.
- Copy that.</i>

39:57.440 --> 39:58.487
Too <i>high!</i>

39:58.640 --> 39:59.880
<i>It all dispersed.</i>

40:00.080 --> 40:01.650
<i>Windlifter, finish off that ridge.</i>

40:01.800 --> 40:03.404
Windlifter copies.

40:07.680 --> 40:08.806
Pull back!

40:09.160 --> 40:11.288
Pull back! Let's go, let's go right now!

40:19.120 --> 40:20.770
Blade, we got a situation.

40:20.840 --> 40:22.888
The wind shifted.
The fire jumped the line.

40:22.960 --> 40:24.086
<i>Can you make it
to your safety zone?</i>

40:24.160 --> 40:26.003
No, no good.
Our escape route is blocked.

40:26.840 --> 40:27.841
We need a drop.

40:27.920 --> 40:29.684
<i>Copy that.
Dipper, smokejumpers trapped.</i>

40:29.760 --> 40:31.091
Left flank, set up for a drop.

40:31.160 --> 40:33.208
<i>I see them. I've got it.</i>

40:46.880 --> 40:48.120
<i>All right. We're clear.</i>

40:48.200 --> 40:49.804
<i>Let's move. Let's get to the lake.</i>

40:50.200 --> 40:52.885
<i>That's my Dust Muffin!</i>

40:53.040 --> 40:54.724
<i>Champ, load and return.</i>

40:54.840 --> 40:56.410
<i>We still got a lot of work to do.</i>

40:56.520 --> 40:58.010
Copy that.

41:03.560 --> 41:05.210
<i>Dynamite just reported in.</i>

41:05.280 --> 41:08.124
<i>They're gonna camp out tonight
and mop it up tomorrow.</i>

41:08.200 --> 41:09.645
Cabbie, how's it looking?

41:09.720 --> 41:11.404
We got that sucker boxed in.

41:11.480 --> 41:12.481
Nice work!

41:12.560 --> 41:13.760
That's why we're here.

41:14.400 --> 41:16.164
So, that's it?

41:16.240 --> 41:17.890
Yep, fire is contained.

41:18.040 --> 41:20.407
The jumpers will stir on it until it's out.

41:20.560 --> 41:22.403
You did a great job out there,
sweet SEAT.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.041
Thanks. I saw the jumpers in trouble...

41:24.080 --> 41:26.162
You broke formation
in a crowded airspace.

41:26.240 --> 41:27.651
Could've been you spread
all over the woods

41:27.720 --> 41:29.449
instead of retardant.

41:29.520 --> 41:33.002
Don't go planning
your certification party yet, Champ.

41:33.080 --> 41:34.161
Oh, man.

41:34.240 --> 41:37.528
Come on, that's just Blade's
way of saying "Good job."

41:39.600 --> 41:41.409
Whoa. That was low.

41:41.960 --> 41:43.371
Cad's VIPs.

41:43.520 --> 41:44.681
Oh, yeah, that's right.

41:44.760 --> 41:46.091
He's having a big party
up at the lodge tonight.

41:46.160 --> 41:47.321
We should go!

41:47.440 --> 41:50.603
A second date? Wow! Room!

41:50.920 --> 41:52.649
Uh, I kind of meant all of us.

41:52.720 --> 41:55.849
You know, you and me,
and Windlifter, and just everybody.

41:55.920 --> 41:57.684
Oh! Okay.

41:57.760 --> 41:59.205
Okay, okay, yeah. Mmm-hmm.

41:59.280 --> 42:00.361
You're right, you're right.

42:00.440 --> 42:02.204
I should get to know your friends.

42:04.120 --> 42:06.487
But they're your friends.

42:06.560 --> 42:08.688
Well, yeah, I guess. Yeah.

42:09.040 --> 42:10.280
Let's not bicker.

42:24.040 --> 42:25.041
Welcome to the Fusel Lodge.

42:25.120 --> 42:27.566
Be sure to get your complimentary
bumper sticker over at the Gift Garage.

42:27.640 --> 42:29.768
Whoa! Look at this place.

42:29.840 --> 42:31.649
It's so beautiful.

42:31.720 --> 42:34.087
Dusty-poo, this is the perfect date!

42:34.160 --> 42:36.606
Let's check it out before we check in.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.286
- Hey, there, folks.
- Hi.

42:38.360 --> 42:40.727
Like to get your picture taken
with the superintendent?

42:41.800 --> 42:43.325
- Uh...
- Ha!

42:43.600 --> 42:44.840
Classy.

42:45.040 --> 42:46.280
Oui, you're all set

42:46.360 --> 42:48.567
with the Piston view
deluxe honeymoon suite

42:48.640 --> 42:50.005
on our zero-emission floor.

42:52.200 --> 42:53.326
Enjoy your stay.

42:53.400 --> 42:54.401
Wow.

42:54.480 --> 42:56.482
They do weddings here.
Did you know that?

43:00.320 --> 43:02.129
Oh, this is so exciting,
I'm gonna overheat!

43:02.200 --> 43:03.281
Well, I'm hitting the spa.

43:03.360 --> 43:05.681
The high beam steam
takes off 50,000 miles, easy.

43:05.760 --> 43:07.125
Welcome, Mr. Secretary,

43:07.200 --> 43:09.123
to the grand reopening weekend
of the magnificent...

43:09.200 --> 43:10.725
It's a pleasure to be here, Spinner.

43:10.800 --> 43:13.451
And is it a pleasure to see you, sir?
Yes, it is.

43:13.520 --> 43:15.329
So, now, what's this I hear about a fire?

43:15.400 --> 43:16.447
Uh, fire...

43:16.520 --> 43:18.090
The Whitewall Fire is contained, sir.

43:18.160 --> 43:19.280
- Right.
- It's under control.

43:19.320 --> 43:20.287
It's absolutely under control.

43:20.360 --> 43:21.486
- Thank you...
- Engine Pulaski, sir.

43:21.560 --> 43:22.561
- Who-ski?
- "Pulaski."

43:22.640 --> 43:23.926
Right. Anyway, right this way, sir.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.445
And if there's any other
questions you have for me,

43:25.520 --> 43:27.170
please, I am your man.

43:27.240 --> 43:29.129
Don't even have normal coffee here.

43:29.200 --> 43:32.124
I had to get something
called a "Highway Expresso."

43:32.200 --> 43:33.361
What do you think?

43:33.440 --> 43:35.044
- You look good.
- Eh.

43:36.560 --> 43:39.211
Tell me, how's the park's
indigenous wildlife population?

43:39.280 --> 43:40.805
- The what?
- The Wildlife.

43:40.880 --> 43:42.006
Oh, the Wildlife!

43:42.080 --> 43:45.368
Well, if you come to the party tonight,
there'll be plenty of party animals.

43:45.440 --> 43:47.249
Ho, ho, ho. Huh?

43:47.320 --> 43:48.651
I see. Yes.

43:48.720 --> 43:50.131
The deer population is steady.

43:50.200 --> 43:51.565
And we've had a healthy increase

43:51.640 --> 43:53.529
in the number
of red-propped balsa thrush.

43:53.600 --> 43:56.080
Ah, glad to hear it.
Say, I didn't quite catch your name.

43:56.160 --> 43:57.491
Ranger Jammer, sir.

43:57.560 --> 43:59.210
Seventy-two years at Piston Peak.

43:59.320 --> 44:00.970
- Pleased to meet you, Jammer.
- Well, it's a true...

44:01.040 --> 44:02.530
Bumper kisser.

44:02.600 --> 44:04.329
Wow, look at that ice sculpture!

44:04.400 --> 44:07.324
This could be our room
if we were little, tiny pieces of ice.

44:07.400 --> 44:08.481
Dusty Crophopper!

44:09.440 --> 44:10.680
My buddies
are never gonna believe this.

44:10.760 --> 44:12.000
Hey, do my voice-mail.

44:12.080 --> 44:13.320
- Your voice-mail?
- Go!

44:13.400 --> 44:15.482
Oh, hi, this is Dusty Crophopper.

44:15.560 --> 44:17.480
- "World racing champion."
- World racing champion.

44:17.560 --> 44:19.244
Please leave a message at the beep.

44:19.320 --> 44:20.367
- Now, beep.
- What?

44:20.440 --> 44:21.566
- Do it!
- Beep!

44:21.640 --> 44:22.880
That was awesome!

44:23.400 --> 44:24.400
Move along.

44:24.440 --> 44:26.886
Dusty! You have to meet
the Secretary of the Interior.

44:26.960 --> 44:28.325
- Okay.
- I'm up for a promotion.

44:28.400 --> 44:29.731
You understand.
You're upwardly mobile, right?

44:29.800 --> 44:31.520
- Sure.
- Of course, you are. You're a plane.

44:31.560 --> 44:32.925
Hey! Boat Reynolds!

44:33.000 --> 44:35.446
<i>Boat, loved you in
Best Little Boathouse in Texas.</i>

44:35.520 --> 44:37.522
Excuse me, son. Do you work here?

44:37.600 --> 44:38.726
No, not really.

44:38.800 --> 44:40.086
Great, come over here.

44:40.160 --> 44:41.685
It's our anniversary.

44:41.760 --> 44:44.047
- We honeymooned here 50 years ago.
- Can you believe it?

44:44.120 --> 44:46.361
I was 50 years younger
and half a ton lighter.

44:46.440 --> 44:47.441
More to love!

44:47.520 --> 44:48.726
And Harvey, bless his heart,

44:48.800 --> 44:51.690
is trying to find the spot
where we had our first kiss.

44:52.120 --> 44:53.406
Oh, that is so sweet!

44:53.480 --> 44:54.925
You don't do things like that anymore.

44:55.000 --> 44:56.445
Honey, honey, listen, I'm telling you.

44:56.520 --> 45:01.208
There was a bridge,
and a magnificent waterfall, and...

45:03.800 --> 45:05.006
You.

45:05.600 --> 45:07.682
I love you, Harvey.

45:08.640 --> 45:10.642
Hey, you know,
that sounds like Augerin Canyon.

45:10.720 --> 45:12.085
Yeah, that's right! Anger Canyon.

45:12.160 --> 45:13.366
By Upper Whitewall Falls.

45:13.480 --> 45:14.720
By Whitewash Falls!

45:14.800 --> 45:16.290
See? I told you I knew where it was.

45:16.400 --> 45:18.129
Hey, in honor of your anniversary,

45:18.200 --> 45:19.440
why don't you join us?

45:19.520 --> 45:20.931
We'll buy you a can of oil, on me.

45:21.000 --> 45:22.809
Oh, thank you, dear.

45:23.320 --> 45:24.367
Oh, sure, sure.

45:24.480 --> 45:26.050
I've been around the block a few times.

45:26.160 --> 45:27.889
I worked as a taco truck,

45:27.960 --> 45:30.406
sold carwash curtain rings for a while.

45:30.480 --> 45:32.767
Then, I got into RV tire sales.

45:32.840 --> 45:34.569
Winnie here was my showroom model.

45:34.640 --> 45:36.404
That's how we met.

45:36.480 --> 45:37.561
- It's true.
- Aw, nice.

45:37.640 --> 45:40.564
For our wedding day,
bought her the best set of whitewalls.

45:40.640 --> 45:43.246
We wore off the treads
on our honeymoon.

45:43.320 --> 45:44.731
Yeah, oh...

45:45.160 --> 45:47.242
- Driving!
- Oh, driving! Of course!

45:47.320 --> 45:48.401
She said "Driving."

45:48.480 --> 45:49.925
- Delete that thought.
- Deleted!

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
You know, Dusty...

45:51.040 --> 45:53.771
Maybe this firefighting thing
will be a second career for you.

45:53.840 --> 45:56.081
Oh, yeah. This is a second career
for all of us.

45:56.160 --> 45:58.606
Windlifter was a lumberjack,
Cabbie was in the military,

45:58.680 --> 46:01.251
and me, well,
I hauled cargo up in Anchorage.

46:01.360 --> 46:03.522
Yeah, a lot of guys up in Anchorage.

46:03.600 --> 46:05.284
I was beating them off with a stick.

46:05.360 --> 46:06.805
"Come here, boy. No." Boom!

46:06.880 --> 46:09.167
Hey, big whirlybird,
you haven't said much.

46:09.240 --> 46:10.287
How about a toast?

46:10.760 --> 46:12.922
Uh, Windlifter's not really
much for speeches.

46:18.560 --> 46:21.404
A toast to Coyote.

46:22.800 --> 46:27.283
It was he who drove all day and all night

46:27.360 --> 46:29.727
to the base of Bright Mountain.

46:29.880 --> 46:31.484
With much difficulty,

46:31.600 --> 46:34.285
he climbed the mountain to obtain fire,

46:34.360 --> 46:37.204
and brought it down to the first vehicles.

46:37.360 --> 46:40.204
But in so doing, he burned his tires.

46:40.280 --> 46:42.806
And when Coyote saw
his blackened tires,

46:42.880 --> 46:46.043
he thought they were his favorite snack,

46:46.120 --> 46:47.884
and he ate them!

46:48.040 --> 46:51.487
For he knew they were still full of life.

46:51.640 --> 46:55.326
And it was in this way,
he let go of the old,

46:55.400 --> 47:00.804
and renewed himself
like fire renews the earth.

47:05.800 --> 47:06.840
Uh, I'm just gonna say it.

47:06.920 --> 47:09.161
You had me up until the part
where he eats his own tires.

47:10.280 --> 47:11.850
Best toast ever, Wind.

47:11.920 --> 47:12.921
Cheers!

47:13.080 --> 47:14.491
Cheers!

47:21.280 --> 47:22.566
<i>Propwash Junction to Dusty.</i>

47:22.640 --> 47:24.449
Oh? Huh? Oh? Oh, Oh.

47:24.680 --> 47:27.126
<i>Come in, Dusty. Come in, Dusty.</i>

47:27.320 --> 47:29.163
<i>Propwash Junction to Dusty.</i>

47:29.280 --> 47:30.486
Hey, Skip.

47:30.680 --> 47:31.681
Oh.

47:31.840 --> 47:32.921
What's up?

47:33.360 --> 47:35.601
Oh, did the gearbox come in?

47:36.440 --> 47:39.011
<i>Well,</i> we...

47:40.120 --> 47:41.201
What?

47:41.280 --> 47:42.281
<i>So...</i>

47:42.600 --> 47:47.009
Dust... Sparky, <i>I'll</i> tell him.

47:50.120 --> 47:52.043
<i>It was the wrong one.</i>

47:53.160 --> 47:57.131
<i>The crate... It was mislabeled.</i>

47:57.960 --> 48:01.487
<i>We've called every parts
supplier, repair shop,</i>

48:01.560 --> 48:04.291
<i>and junkyard in the country.</i>

48:06.120 --> 48:08.327
<i>Nobody has your gearbox.</i>

48:12.720 --> 48:13.960
Dusty?

48:16.880 --> 48:17.881
I'm here.

48:19.160 --> 48:20.571
I'm sorry.

48:24.560 --> 48:26.005
<i>I gotta go.</i>

48:27.400 --> 48:28.845
<i>Thanks.</i>

48:36.040 --> 48:38.566
<i>All aircraft, we've got two fires.</i>

48:39.480 --> 48:40.527
Hey, Crophopper.

48:40.840 --> 48:43.650
Get this, Cad's fancy jet VIPs

48:43.720 --> 48:46.246
flew in too low over
the burn area last night,

48:46.360 --> 48:48.567
blew embers in all directions.

48:50.160 --> 48:52.930
Champ, let's load and go.

48:55.840 --> 48:57.808
<i>The fire broke containment
and split in two.</i>

48:57.880 --> 49:00.281
<i>Windlifter, you and Dipper
take the Coil Springs fire.</i>

49:00.360 --> 49:02.328
<i>Me and the SEAT
will take Whitewall Rapids.</i>

49:02.400 --> 49:04.209
Windlifter copies.

49:17.760 --> 49:19.728
- Maru, come in.
- Yeah, Blade?

49:19.800 --> 49:21.200
- It's worse than we thought.
- Yeah?

49:21.240 --> 49:22.526
Get on the horn to the lodge.

49:22.600 --> 49:24.648
That fire is about four hours
from their front door.

49:24.720 --> 49:25.960
They're gonna have to evacuate.

49:26.040 --> 49:27.280
Absolutely not!

49:27.400 --> 49:28.731
<i>Blade insists.</i>

49:28.800 --> 49:30.882
To be safe, you gotta get everyone out.

49:31.040 --> 49:32.769
I've been working on this lodge
for five years.

49:32.840 --> 49:35.127
I'm not gonna evacuate now
just to be "safe."

49:35.240 --> 49:36.890
<i>You got less than four hours.</i>

49:37.240 --> 49:38.366
Why am I talking to you?

49:38.440 --> 49:39.441
<i>Where's Blade?</i>

49:39.560 --> 49:41.324
Oh, he's out back sipping a motorjito.

49:41.480 --> 49:42.811
Where do you think he is?

49:43.000 --> 49:44.604
He's out fighting the fire!

49:44.880 --> 49:46.211
If we're gonna save the lodge,

49:46.280 --> 49:48.169
we've gotta keep this fire
from cresting the ridge.

49:48.240 --> 49:50.242
I'll drop, then you tag on and extend.

49:50.320 --> 49:52.243
And make it a split load.

49:52.320 --> 49:55.051
That way, we can double up
and widen it downwind of the ridge...

49:55.120 --> 49:58.203
<i>If you push yourself
into the red, you'll crash.</i>

49:58.280 --> 50:00.009
<i>Nobody has your gearbox.</i>

50:00.080 --> 50:01.241
Copy that?

50:01.800 --> 50:03.325
- Hey! You Copy that?
- Huh?

50:03.400 --> 50:05.528
Yeah. Yes. Copy that.

50:20.320 --> 50:21.810
You gotta be kidding me.

50:23.520 --> 50:25.010
- Was that your whole tank?
- Yeah.

50:25.080 --> 50:26.206
You just wasted all of it.

50:26.280 --> 50:27.441
I was just following your orders.

50:27.520 --> 50:28.681
I said, "Split load."

50:28.760 --> 50:29.966
We were going to make
a secondary line

50:30.040 --> 50:31.371
to protect that lodge.

50:31.440 --> 50:32.601
It'll be fine. I can reload at the lake.

50:32.680 --> 50:34.091
Negative! Return to base.

50:34.160 --> 50:36.731
No! There's no time.
Let's just get this fire out.

50:36.800 --> 50:38.290
Hey, hey! You need to listen to me!

50:38.360 --> 50:39.805
I'll be fine!

50:41.200 --> 50:43.726
<i>These crosswinds
are too strong. Return to base!</i>

50:43.800 --> 50:45.211
This is what you trained me to do!

50:45.280 --> 50:46.725
<i>Not under these conditions.</i>

50:46.800 --> 50:48.768
If we're gonna get this fire out,
I've gotta reload.

50:48.840 --> 50:51.161
<i>- Pull up, that's an order!
- No,</i> I <i>can do this.</i>

50:52.160 --> 50:53.650
Oh! Ah!

50:58.480 --> 51:00.289
I've taken in too much water.

51:00.360 --> 51:02.931
<i>- My engine stalled.
- Stalled?</i>

51:06.200 --> 51:09.363
<i>Keep your pontoons downstream.
I'll keep ahead of you.</i>

51:09.480 --> 51:10.481
<i>I'll get out on my own.</i>

51:10.560 --> 51:11.607
<i>How you planning on doing that?</i>

51:11.680 --> 51:12.886
<i>I'll restart my engine.</i>

51:14.320 --> 51:16.527
<i>Just hang on.
I'm gonna pull you to shore.</i>

51:17.760 --> 51:18.841
Got it!

51:23.400 --> 51:24.401
Ah!

51:29.320 --> 51:31.163
Ah. Ah!

51:31.520 --> 51:33.522
<i>- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.</i>

51:33.600 --> 51:34.640
<i>There's too much coverage.</i>

51:34.680 --> 51:37.001
<i>Don't worry,
I'll get you at the next clearing.</i>

51:37.080 --> 51:38.081
Right.

51:48.200 --> 51:50.521
The hoist, it's caught.

51:53.360 --> 51:54.441
- Uh!
- Blade...

51:55.000 --> 51:56.001
Blade!

51:56.120 --> 51:57.406
Oh, come on.

51:57.560 --> 51:58.800
You need to start your engine.

51:58.880 --> 52:01.161
You've got clear water.
You can take off before the falls.

52:01.880 --> 52:03.450
<i>It's your only chance.</i>

52:05.520 --> 52:06.965
Right! Right.

52:07.120 --> 52:09.088
Got it. I'm good!

52:09.240 --> 52:10.287
Now, redline it.

52:11.680 --> 52:12.886
Push your engine!

52:15.160 --> 52:16.161
Redline it!

52:17.400 --> 52:18.970
<i>You need more lift!</i>

52:19.040 --> 52:20.690
<i>Redline it! Redline it!</i>

52:21.680 --> 52:23.682
<i>Why are you holding back? Redline it!</i>

52:25.040 --> 52:27.122
Ah! Oh!

52:37.320 --> 52:38.685
Why didn't you redline it?

52:38.800 --> 52:41.849
You could've made it!
What were you thinking?

52:43.320 --> 52:45.448
What? What's wrong?

52:48.760 --> 52:50.091
This ain't good.

52:50.520 --> 52:53.171
<i>Head down that path. Follow me.</i>

52:55.640 --> 52:57.085
<i>Champ, come on!</i>

52:58.880 --> 52:59.961
<i>In</i> here.

53:00.040 --> 53:02.247
An old mine? We can't go in there.

53:02.320 --> 53:03.560
We'll suffocate!

53:03.640 --> 53:05.165
It's our only chance.
We'll let it burn over.

53:05.240 --> 53:07.368
No, you go on. I'll keep moving.

53:07.440 --> 53:09.727
What are you doing? Hey. Hey!

53:10.280 --> 53:11.645
You can't outrun the fire.

53:11.720 --> 53:13.160
You know what? I'll find my way out.

53:13.360 --> 53:15.124
Like you found your way
out of the rapids.

53:15.200 --> 53:17.168
I didn't want to push my engine.

53:17.240 --> 53:19.000
- You didn't "want" to?
- Blade, listen to me.

53:19.040 --> 53:21.520
This isn't about you.
This is about life and death.

53:21.600 --> 53:22.886
You need to follow orders.

53:22.960 --> 53:24.928
I told you, "Split load,"
you dropped it all.

53:25.080 --> 53:27.526
I told you not to reload on the lake,
you did it anyway.

53:27.640 --> 53:29.369
I told you, "Redline it,"
you pulled power.

53:29.440 --> 53:31.761
You don't have what it takes! You don't!

53:31.840 --> 53:34.684
Fine! I never wanted to be
a firefighter anyway!

53:34.760 --> 53:35.966
Then go back to racing!

53:36.760 --> 53:39.206
Go win yourself another trophy, Champ.

53:39.280 --> 53:40.486
I can't!

53:40.640 --> 53:43.689
My gearbox is busted! All right?

53:43.840 --> 53:46.286
That's why I pulled power.

53:46.440 --> 53:48.966
I'm never gonna...

53:54.960 --> 53:57.964
Life doesn't always go
the way you expect it.

53:58.120 --> 54:00.851
But you came here
to become a firefighter.

54:01.000 --> 54:02.445
If you give up today,

54:02.800 --> 54:06.282
think of all the lives
you won't save tomorrow.

54:09.000 --> 54:10.968
So, what are you going to do?

55:00.880 --> 55:03.406
Is it a beautiful day
here at Piston Peak Park?

55:03.480 --> 55:04.720
Yes, it is!

55:04.880 --> 55:06.848
Thanks for coming out, everybody.

55:07.000 --> 55:08.570
And I'd like to give a special welcome

55:08.640 --> 55:10.165
to the Secretary of the Interior

55:10.240 --> 55:13.881
who is joining us for the unveiling of this
commemorative...

55:14.280 --> 55:15.361
Plaque.

55:15.520 --> 55:17.081
The safety of the tourists is at stake!

55:17.440 --> 55:18.521
Sorry about that.

55:18.600 --> 55:21.321
If you could excuse me for a moment,
ladies and gentlemen. Thank you.

55:22.040 --> 55:23.201
Am I giving a speech?

55:23.280 --> 55:24.520
Yes, I am, Pnewski.

55:24.600 --> 55:25.647
- No, sir, "Pulaski."
- Papooski.

55:25.720 --> 55:26.767
- "Pulaski."
- P'tootsie.

55:26.840 --> 55:28.080
"Pulaski."

55:29.520 --> 55:31.170
That's what I said.
We're saying the same thing.

55:31.240 --> 55:33.163
With all due respect,
Superintendent Spinner,

55:33.240 --> 55:35.891
the smoke over the ridge
is growing closer.

55:35.960 --> 55:38.201
Yeah, perhaps we should
turn on the roof sprinklers?

55:38.280 --> 55:39.486
We must evacuate.

55:39.560 --> 55:41.164
Better listen to them, Cad. They're right.

55:41.240 --> 55:42.605
Come on, Spinner!
Let's see that plaque.

55:42.680 --> 55:43.681
Right away, sir!

55:43.760 --> 55:44.921
We need to cancel the unveiling.

55:45.000 --> 55:46.240
The longer we wait, the worse it'll get.

55:46.400 --> 55:48.209
Who are you?

55:48.320 --> 55:49.446
You're a glorified bell boy.

55:49.520 --> 55:50.681
You're an overpriced sprinkler,

55:50.760 --> 55:52.888
and you're old,
and you have a dumb hat on.

55:52.960 --> 55:56.521
Who am I? I'm the Superintendent,
and today is about me and my lodge.

55:56.600 --> 55:58.807
And now is the moment
I've been waiting for!

56:03.920 --> 56:05.081
Now, that's just rude.

56:05.160 --> 56:06.446
- Fire!
- Oh.

56:08.000 --> 56:09.570
Let's get out of here.

56:12.080 --> 56:13.923
Quickly! Quickly. We must evacuate.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.002
Don't panic! We must evacuate!

56:16.080 --> 56:17.605
This is a mandatory evacuation,

56:17.680 --> 56:19.330
but we have plenty of time.

56:19.400 --> 56:20.765
Keep moving.

56:20.840 --> 56:22.001
Keep going at a steady pace.

56:22.080 --> 56:23.923
Keep moving slowly, but carefully.

56:24.000 --> 56:25.411
All right. Look, there's no need to panic.

56:25.480 --> 56:26.720
It's really just a small, little fire.

56:26.800 --> 56:29.690
If you all just calm down,
you can come back next year.

56:29.760 --> 56:31.410
Sure, you can all come back next year.

56:31.480 --> 56:33.050
I'll see you right here!

56:34.360 --> 56:36.249
Move along. That's it.

56:36.760 --> 56:40.162
And remember, avoid the smoke,
stay above the canyon walls,

56:40.240 --> 56:41.366
you'll be okay.

56:41.480 --> 56:42.481
All right, next, please.

56:46.040 --> 56:47.769
Out of my way, tail dragger.

56:47.880 --> 56:50.326
Hold on, there, big fella. No cutsies.

56:50.400 --> 56:51.920
You don't want
to upset my buddy, here.

56:54.200 --> 56:55.486
All right, ma'am,
you're clear for takeoff.

56:55.560 --> 56:56.561
Thank you!

56:56.680 --> 56:58.250
Remember to avoid the smoke

56:58.320 --> 57:01.403
and stay above the canyon walls!

57:01.600 --> 57:05.082
Move along. Quickly, please.

57:05.240 --> 57:06.810
I'm sorry. I am sorry. That is all.

57:06.880 --> 57:08.245
The train is full.

57:08.360 --> 57:10.442
Remaining guests,
please follow a staff member.

57:10.520 --> 57:12.363
They will lead you to the main road exit.

57:12.440 --> 57:13.885
All aboard!

57:50.080 --> 57:53.447
Blade... Airway Meadow
should be clear.

57:55.120 --> 57:57.282
We'll take off from there.

57:57.440 --> 57:58.771
Let's go.

58:14.680 --> 58:16.250
Blade!

58:17.040 --> 58:18.087
Blade!

58:18.160 --> 58:19.571
Patch, come in,
this is Crophopper Seven.

58:19.680 --> 58:21.011
Patch, come in!

58:21.080 --> 58:22.520
<i>I read you, Crophopper Seven.</i>

58:22.600 --> 58:24.967
Blade is down. I repeat, Blade is down!

58:25.040 --> 58:26.929
<i>I'll send Windlifter to respond.</i>

58:27.000 --> 58:28.331
<i>Stay at your location.</i>

58:28.960 --> 58:32.009
Okay, that's good. Slow, slow.

58:32.160 --> 58:33.241
Good, good.

58:34.480 --> 58:35.720
Careful!

58:35.880 --> 58:37.120
Good. We're good!

58:37.320 --> 58:38.765
Pinecone, get those straps off.

58:38.840 --> 58:39.887
- Avalanche?
- Yes!

58:39.960 --> 58:42.406
Push the ramp alongside
the access panel and be careful.

58:44.040 --> 58:45.166
He'll be okay, right?

58:45.240 --> 58:48.244
It's bad, but, Maru,
he's the best there is.

58:48.320 --> 58:49.606
He'll make him better than new.

58:51.240 --> 58:52.765
His hydraulics are completely fried.

58:52.880 --> 58:53.961
He's losing fluids.

58:54.040 --> 58:55.530
I gotta get him back to the garage, stat.

58:55.600 --> 58:57.011
Dynamite, tow hook!

58:57.080 --> 58:58.206
Coming right up.

58:58.280 --> 58:59.611
I'm gonna need hydraulic
fluid from the shed.

58:59.720 --> 59:00.721
Copy that.

59:00.800 --> 59:02.689
- Blackout, we'll need another generator.
- I got it!

59:02.760 --> 59:03.761
Try the main hangar.

59:03.840 --> 59:05.171
- And grab another heat lamp!
- Yes, boss!

59:05.240 --> 59:06.571
The surface burns are bad,

59:06.640 --> 59:08.369
but the interior damage is repairable.

59:08.480 --> 59:10.642
As long as we move quick,
we got a good chance.

59:18.720 --> 59:20.006
How is he?

59:21.280 --> 59:22.884
He's resting now.

59:22.960 --> 59:24.200
Oh.

59:24.360 --> 59:26.124
I've done everything I can.

59:30.920 --> 59:32.126
Do you think he's gonna be...

59:32.200 --> 59:34.646
Look, Dusty, don't blame yourself.

59:35.240 --> 59:37.049
He should have left me out there.

59:37.120 --> 59:38.121
Nah.

59:38.520 --> 59:40.409
That ain't Blade's style.

59:42.320 --> 59:45.244
Especially since
what happened to Nick.

59:45.320 --> 59:46.321
Nick?

59:46.400 --> 59:49.529
You mean Nick Loopin' Lopez
from the TV show?

59:52.160 --> 59:54.242
It was just a routine day on the set.

59:54.360 --> 59:57.091
And Nick, he was doing

59:57.160 --> 59:59.811
his trademark loop for a stunt scene.

59:59.880 --> 01:00:02.360
But there was this freak crosswind.

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:08.081
Blade was the first one on the scene...

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:12.240
But he didn't know what to do.

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:14.402
His best friend was gone.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:17.370
And Blade thought
his life was over, too.

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:18.885
But he didn't give up.

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:23.725
He got trained, got certified,
and came here.

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:28.690
Blade, he used to pretend to save lives.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:33.001
Now, he saves them for real.

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:35.647
What's going on up there?

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.165
We're not getting enough water.

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:39.447
Hey! We're not getting
enough water on the lodge.

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:41.921
Reroute the main water line
to the roof sprinklers.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.206
Oh. No, no, no!

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:44.884
The firefighters need that
water to make retardant.

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:46.640
- How do you know that?
- I'm the concierge.

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:47.920
It's my job to know everything.

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:49.041
I don't care!

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:50.884
Do you work for them? No, you
work for me, what's-your-name.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.844
Now, are you gonna do it,
or do I have to do it myself?

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.004
Come on, come on!

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:00.681
I got it!

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:13.405
All right, everybody, stay calm.

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:14.686
Both roads are open.

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:16.410
Keep your headlights
on low-beam

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.642
and stay under five miles an hour.

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:19.721
And be careful!

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:21.211
That's right.

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:22.481
It's going to be fine.

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:25.291
Keep moving.
We're gonna get everybody out.

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:27.683
Good gracious!

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:40.441
Watch out!

01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:52.881
Pulaski, you hurt?

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:53.961
Are you okay?

01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:55.485
No, sir. Pump's busted.

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:56.766
We're gonna have to find
another way out.

01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:58.842
That's the problem, Mr. Secretary.

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:01.366
There is no other way out.

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:03.647
<i>Listen up, y'all, we got big trouble.</i>

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:06.883
<i>Wildfire jumped the main exit road
and now it's blocked.</i>

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:10.123
I know it's after sunset,
but you're in command.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:11.486
It's your call.

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:12.561
There's not much time.

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:14.165
If you're gonna go, you better go now.

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:16.402
And we'll need every plane we've got.

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:20.326
Load up.

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:36.328
We'll have you out of here in 60...

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:38.211
Huh? Uh...

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:43.886
Problem! There's no water pressure.

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:45.450
Main line must have burst again.

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:47.522
Hey, Patch, what's the lake look like?

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:49.722
<i>Negative. No Visibility.</i>

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:52.201
<i>Boxed in by fire and smoke.</i>

01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:55.091
All we have left is what's in our tanks.

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:57.288
Let's make it count.

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:14.602
We're headed straight into the fire.

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:15.761
Aren't we gonna fly around it?

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:19.083
The fastest way to the main road
is through the fire.

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:20.571
Brace yourselves.

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:40.160
Hold On, Dusty!

01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:58.565
Let's clear this road.

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:15.322
All right, now, be careful.

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:16.845
Slow and steady.

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:20.567
We don't want to see
any fender benders around here.

01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:25.971
<i>Windlifter, do you copy?</i>

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:27.121
Go ahead, Patch.

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:30.170
<i>We've got two old RVs
trapped in Augerin Canyon.</i>

01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:32.766
Two old RVs? Oh, no.

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:36.609
It's Harvey and Winnie.

01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:37.681
We met them earlier.

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:39.524
They're looking for the place
they had their first kiss.

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:41.841
Augerin Canyon.
That's at the other end of the park.

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:43.046
I can get there the fastest.

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:44.850
The canyon will be engulfed in flames

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:46.291
and you have no retardant.

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:47.361
I'll scoop off the river.

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:49.169
There's a clear stretch of water.

01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:54.369
Windlifter, I can do it.

01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:58.240
Go. And be safe.

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:17.962
Help!

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:20.886
- Help.
- Help!

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:45.006
Winnie, hang on!

01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:46.730
Aah!

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:19.681
- Harvey, Harvey, don't let go!
- Hold on, it'll be okay.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.001
Dusty.

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:45.484
Good move, partner.

01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:20.286
Maru?

01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:23.811
Hello, there. Ha-ha!

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:25.721
He's awake!

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:27.370
I'm a genius.

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:29.729
Morning, mud dropper.

01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:31.120
How long have I been out?

01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:32.247
Five days.

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:34.800
Dipper stayed by your side
the whole time.

01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:40.130
I like watching you sleep.

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:42.520
- He's alive!
- Looking good, Dusty.

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:43.600
All aircraft,

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:45.324
<i>the superintendent
has entered the base.</i>

01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:47.402
<i>The superintendent
has entered the base.</i>

01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:49.562
Well, you had us worried, Dusty.

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:51.284
Glad to see you're out and about.

01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:54.371
You're the superinten...
What happened to Cad?

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:57.645
Sprinkler saved the lodge,
but not his job.

01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:59.643
Secretary of the Interior
did the right thing.

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:01.404
Put Ranger Jammer, here, in charge.

01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:02.527
Yay!

01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:05.524
Maru, did you tell him?

01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:09.723
Uh... Tell me what?

01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:12.244
I replaced your prop.

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:15.246
Repaired the damaged wing ribs.

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:17.163
Hammered out what damage I could.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.731
Even got your pontoons back on.

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:24.849
But your gearbox...

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:28.770
I know. Thanks for trying, Maru.

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:30.441
You're welcome!

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:32.090
- What?
- Because you're fixed!

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:33.241
Wait. Really?

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:35.721
Yeah, that was the hardest thing
I've ever done.

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:37.928
You've got yourself a custom-made

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.606
epicyclic, concentric reduction gearbox.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.525
A new gearbox?

01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:45.126
No. It's better than new.

01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:48.489
Crophopper, I'd say you've
earned that certification.

01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:54.445
In accordance with
CFR title 14, volume three,

01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:57.330
chapter one, section 139,
sub-paragraph B,

01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:59.402
Propwash Junction is recertified

01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:00.811
and open for operation.

01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:03.081
Go, Dusty!

01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:05.242
Hey, Dusty, I won, I won!

01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:07.164
Duster, guess what.

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:10.244
I've been crowned official Corn Colonel.

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:11.845
And I'm his Private Niblet.

01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:14.048
Can I wear my official hat
to your race next Saturday?

01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:15.201
Absolutely, Chug.

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:17.009
As long as the boss, here,
will give me the day off.

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:18.445
Anytime.

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:20.688
Okay, Niblet, time to hit the festival!

01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:22.489
Sir, yes, sir.

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:24.881
Hey, you think the deep fried
corn cob on a stick guy...

01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:27.088
Aw, Dusty, we're all so proud of you.

01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:28.207
Thanks, Mayday.

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:30.527
What you did for me, for all of us,

01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:31.965
I want to thank you.

01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:34.247
- You don't have to thank me.
- Yes, I do.

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:35.560
To do what you did,

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:40.045
it takes a special kind of plane.

01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:46.286
<i>Ladies and gentleplanes,</i>

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.966
<i>turn your attention to the skies</i>

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:51.771
<i>for today's featured aerial presentation.</i>

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:55.447
<i>The Propwash Junction Corn Fest
is proud to present</i>

01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:57.841
<i>the Piston Peak Air Attack team</i>

01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:00.127
<i>and our very own
world champion racer</i>

01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:01.201
<i>and firefighter,</i>

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:04.923
<i>Dusty Crophopper.</i>

01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:29.330
Whoa. Huh?

01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:32.607
Welcome to Death Valley National Park.

01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:35.366
Is it hot?

01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:37.687
Yes, it is.

01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:21.970
Let's keep up the pace!

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:23.963
Avalanche, Blackout,
move, move, move!

01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:25.087
Did you guys see that?

01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:26.969
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Yay!
