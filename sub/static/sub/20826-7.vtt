- Fourteen.
- Fourteen?

- Oh, my God!

00:38.455 --> 00:40.165
I thought you were just short!

00:40.249 --> 00:42.251
You got to go! We
shouldn't have done this!

00:42.334 --> 00:44.753
- You're the one who started it!
- Why'd you have a boner?

00:44.836 --> 00:47.464

What was I supposed to do?

- Okay.
- So you're saying we're okay?

It'll be like the old days.

03:04.976 --> 03:07.938
I'll take you to an early movie,
we can go to a nice restaurant,

03:08.021 --> 03:10.732
we can get to second
base in the back seat.

03:10.816 --> 03:12.234
Don't you have to work tonight?

03:12.317 --> 03:16.321
Oh, well, Smokey will just have to
find someone to cover me for a change.

03:16.405 --> 03:18.573
That would be great. I'll
wear that dress you like.

03:18.657 --> 03:20.742
I'll wear that tie from our first date.

03:20.826 --> 03:23.161
It still has that hollandaise
sauce stain on it.

03:23.245 --> 03:26.331
I love that stain. It looks
like Barbara Stanwyck.

03:26.415 --> 03:28.542
That's what I was wearing
when I gave you that locket.

03:29.668 --> 03:30.961
Right. The locket.

03:31.044 --> 03:35.257
And... remember what we did
after I gave you that locket?

miss it for one second.

You know, it's almost impossible
to find an un-cursed set.

08:26.131 --> 08:28.550
But since you came all the way out here,

08:28.633 --> 08:31.678
what's this new idea you
want to tell me about?

I know what you mean. But...

08:44.983 --> 08:46.067
Wet lettuce.

08:46.151 --> 08:47.694
Right. Wet lettuce.

08:47.777 --> 08:50.655
Luckily, Sue has invented a handy device

08:50.739 --> 08:54.576

dry your lettuce in seconds.

08:59.998 --> 09:02.625
And I care about it because...?

09:02.709 --> 09:06.046
Oh, yes, right. The pitch.

09:06.129 --> 09:07.380
No pressure, dear.

09:35.658 --> 09:37.285
I don't feel so good.

09:37.368 --> 09:40.705
I'm sorry, but I got
the flu or something.

09:40.789 --> 09:43.166
Don't think I can make it in tonight.

09:43.249 --> 09:45.960
I'm so sorry you ain't feeling good.

take your rectal temperature...

my anniversary and I haven't...

09:56.387 --> 09:58.932
Your anniversary? Oh, that's important!

09:59.015 --> 10:01.059
Don't come in tonight.
What'd you get her?

10:01.142 --> 10:02.560
I still have to go to the store.

10:35.343 --> 10:37.262
It's your turn! Do something!

10:37.345 --> 10:38.388
Okay.

10:39.305 --> 10:40.515
Um...

10:41.474 --> 10:42.559
That's a start.

10:42.642 --> 10:43.893
Sorry, Mom.

10:44.686 --> 10:46.855
Hey, you guys cut school today, too?

10:46.938 --> 10:50.942
No. We get home-schooled by an owl.

10:51.025 --> 10:54.779
Our daddy glued one of them
professor hats to his head.

10:54.863 --> 10:58.491
He kept spinning his neck around
trying to make it fall off,

10:58.575 --> 10:59.951
but then he gived up.

11:00.034 --> 11:02.787
Hey, you guys want to do
something really fun?

11:02.871 --> 11:03.705
- Yeah!
- No.

11:03.788 --> 11:06.207
Let's go to the supermarket
and lick some meat!

11:06.916 --> 11:08.334
[Bill] I got a better idea.

11:09.919 --> 11:14.841
What if we stuff these clothes with some
leaves and dirt and threw it at a car?

11:14.924 --> 11:17.844
We can't do that. It's dangerous.

11:17.927 --> 11:19.220
It'll be fun!

11:19.304 --> 11:21.890
Come on, you're making a
big deal out of nothing!

11:22.515 --> 11:23.975
[Ben] Holy shit!

11:24.684 --> 11:26.227
Who left the seat up?

11:29.856 --> 11:30.857
Jesus Christ.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.610
What am I, the Shah of Iran?

11:33.693 --> 11:36.112
Frank? Frank Murphy?

11:36.195 --> 11:38.197
Oh, fuck me.

11:38.281 --> 11:39.532
Hey, Ginny. Greg.

11:39.616 --> 11:43.036
Oh, I love hearing our names together.

11:47.665 --> 11:48.917
I love women!

11:49.000 --> 11:51.461
I love putting my tongue in her head!

11:52.128 --> 11:53.796
I'd love to chat, but...

11:54.589 --> 11:57.550
today's our anniversary and
I got to buy Sue a present.

11:57.634 --> 11:58.927
Congratulations!

11:59.010 --> 12:01.971
Oh, I'm so happy you two
have what Greg and I do.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.390
Marriage is a lot of work.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.309
So much work.

12:06.392 --> 12:09.228
It's important to do things
together as a couple.

12:09.312 --> 12:13.107
Like, you caught us on
Greg's "Pants Shopping Day."

12:13.191 --> 12:17.654
Every Thursday at noon, Greg's got
to look at pants in this very store.

12:18.404 --> 12:19.781
He's such a man.

12:19.864 --> 12:23.826
Excuse me, lover, I have
to go try these on.

12:23.910 --> 12:28.247
He's always in room three.
Oh, he's so superstitious.

12:28.331 --> 12:31.542
Good seeing you, Ginny, but I got to
go pick out something nice for Sue.

12:31.626 --> 12:34.295
Feeling pressured to get a good gift?

12:34.379 --> 12:36.881
Pressure? No! Why would
I feel any pressure?

12:36.965 --> 12:39.509
Good for you for going the extra mile.

12:39.592 --> 12:42.595
Greg and I have learned that
the secret to a happy marriage

12:42.679 --> 12:45.974
is being in touch with
what your partner needs.

12:46.057 --> 12:47.392
Let me give you a tip.

12:47.475 --> 12:48.643
[Greg] Oh, the tip!

12:48.726 --> 12:51.604
It's important to show
your love in small ways,

12:51.688 --> 12:54.649
and sometimes very big
and expensive ways.

12:54.732 --> 12:56.776
Jesus, I got to get Sue
something really good.

12:56.859 --> 12:59.028
The jewelry department's on
the second floor, right?

12:59.112 --> 13:01.197
[Greg] Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

13:01.280 --> 13:02.949
Thanks, pal!

13:03.908 --> 13:08.371
"No longer will your salad be held
prisoner by the forces of moisture.

13:11.124 --> 13:14.335
Caesar the day with the Salad Tosser."

13:15.378 --> 13:16.421
[timer stops]

13:17.964 --> 13:20.341
Well, that was uninspiring.

13:20.925 --> 13:23.720
Thank you for wasting
what's left of my morning.

13:23.803 --> 13:28.141
- Show them out, Huddleston!
- But Henrietta... this is a great idea!

13:28.224 --> 13:31.352
I hear great ideas all day long.

13:31.436 --> 13:34.230
I don't buy ideas, I buy passion!

13:34.313 --> 13:36.315
You think you can just waltz in here,

13:36.399 --> 13:39.527
read your little book report and
voila, you're a millionaire?

13:39.610 --> 13:40.862
I've got passion!

13:40.945 --> 13:42.947
Well, then I feel very
sorry for your husband.

13:43.031 --> 13:46.284
- You have no right to say that to me!
- Sue, stop it.

13:46.367 --> 13:49.328
No, you stop it. I'll tell
you something about passion.

13:49.412 --> 13:53.124
- I worked my ass off on this invention.
- Well, clearly not all of it.

13:53.207 --> 13:57.712
I came up with this idea when my
secondhand washing machine broke down.

13:57.795 --> 14:01.591
I spent all night building
a mock-up in my garage.

14:01.674 --> 14:05.970
I sold a precious locket
that my husband gave me

14:06.023 --> 14:08.197
to pay for this prototype that you have

14:08.299 --> 14:10.165
the gall to say I don't
have passion for!

14:10.224 --> 14:12.643
And this is a great idea!

14:12.727 --> 14:14.103
And if you can't see that,

14:14.187 --> 14:17.899
then you don't deserve the name Mrs.
Plast-a-Ware!

14:24.572 --> 14:25.823
Oh, Sue.

14:25.907 --> 14:29.243
I haven't slow clapped
since Kennedy was shot.

14:29.318 --> 14:31.487
You passed the test, Sue.

14:31.579 --> 14:32.988
That's how you sell a product

14:33.013 --> 14:35.440
and that's the kind of
passion I can get behind!

14:35.500 --> 14:36.667
You really mean it?

14:36.751 --> 14:41.339
Sue, once upon a time, I was a
young housewife, just like you:

14:41.422 --> 14:45.009
poor, overweight, no sense
of style or elegance.

14:45.093 --> 14:50.848
But then I invented a container out of a
new space-age material called plastic.

14:50.932 --> 14:54.685
And with that first bowl, came
the sound of a revolution:

14:54.769 --> 14:56.854
The Big Burp.

14:56.938 --> 14:58.940
Sue, this invention is your Big Burp.

14:59.023 --> 15:02.026
And just like I said to my
high school choir director,

15:02.110 --> 15:04.987
I want this baby!

15:05.071 --> 15:07.573
And I want to sell this baby!

15:07.657 --> 15:09.325
So, you'll recommend it to Tracy?

15:09.409 --> 15:11.577
Fuck him! This is mine!

15:11.661 --> 15:14.065
It's the product I need
to get my company back

15:14.090 --> 15:15.981
from those pricks who pushed me out.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.418
Girls, next week at the
stockholder meeting,

15:18.501 --> 15:22.088
when they expect me to just
show up and pose for pictures,

15:22.171 --> 15:24.257
we'll spring the Salad Tosser on them!

15:24.340 --> 15:25.591
That's wonderful!

15:25.675 --> 15:27.343
Now, bring it in, ladies.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.429
[together] Sisters unite!

15:32.014 --> 15:34.016
It comes with me everywhere.

15:38.146 --> 15:39.814
Kevin Murphy! There you are!

15:39.897 --> 15:41.941
Ah! It was her idea! Don't kill me!

15:43.401 --> 15:45.137
What was that rocking tune I heard

15:45.162 --> 15:46.928
coming out of your basement last night?

15:46.988 --> 15:48.865
You guys are sounding great!

15:48.948 --> 15:51.117
I felt that song in my balls.

15:51.200 --> 15:54.036
And coming from your
balls, that means a lot.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.743
My main Monocles, how'd
you like to play

15:55.768 --> 15:57.272
at a party I'm throwing this weekend?

15:57.331 --> 15:58.624
It'd be the kittay's tittays!

15:58.708 --> 16:01.961
Oh! A party at your house?

16:02.044 --> 16:04.297
All the guys from the
station are gonna be there.

16:04.380 --> 16:06.257
Record company suits. My dwarf buddies.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.801
My sensei, guys from the dojo,
purple belts and above.

16:08.900 --> 16:12.904
Yes! We will be there and
we will rock you so hard!

16:12.972 --> 16:14.546
It's for Cutie Pie's birthday!

16:14.571 --> 16:17.728
She's just the greatest chick
a dude could ever have.

16:17.935 --> 16:20.688
Kevin, maybe you'll get a
girl like her someday.

16:20.771 --> 16:21.981
What day? Not yesterday!

16:24.192 --> 16:27.612
Cutie Pie makes my heart race.
She makes me sweat a lot.

16:27.695 --> 16:30.072
She makes me feel like
there's a hole in my nose.

16:30.156 --> 16:31.532
I freaking love that girl!

16:31.616 --> 16:33.576
I want her to have her babies, man!

16:35.286 --> 16:37.288
Hey, Kevin! What are you doing here?

16:37.371 --> 16:39.749
Oh, man, I need to lie down.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.043
I drive better like this, anyway.

16:42.126 --> 16:44.462
I like to look under the steering wheel!

16:44.545 --> 16:46.130
It's a leather rainbow!

16:46.214 --> 16:49.133
- [horn honks]
- [Vic laughs]

16:49.217 --> 16:52.428
- Oh, shit.
- Now we're playing a party!

16:52.512 --> 16:54.889
After struggling for two
weeks, we finally made it!

16:54.972 --> 16:57.141
This is gonna be so rad to the max!

16:58.643 --> 17:01.479
That effigy looks like your dad.

17:01.562 --> 17:04.232
Yeah. My stupid dad.

17:04.315 --> 17:05.483
Let's throw him in the road.

17:05.566 --> 17:08.069
Our daddy ran over a dummy once,

17:08.152 --> 17:10.613
but that dummy was filled
with people blood.

17:10.695 --> 17:14.157
We stayed in Mexico that
summer and Daddy grew a beard.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.036
Oh man, here comes a car!

17:17.118 --> 17:19.204
- Throw him!
- Wait, no!

17:19.288 --> 17:20.915
Don't throw it!

17:21.707 --> 17:22.708
Why'd you do that?

17:22.791 --> 17:26.087
You were gonna cause an accident!
On purpose!

17:26.170 --> 17:28.339
Come on, we're trying to have fun!

17:28.422 --> 17:29.674
This is not fun.

17:29.757 --> 17:32.134
Jesus, you are such a pussy!

17:35.346 --> 17:38.474
I don't want to be friends
with you anymore.

17:47.024 --> 17:48.651
Ah! A person!

17:48.734 --> 17:50.319
[laughing]

17:50.403 --> 17:51.529
Pussy.

17:51.612 --> 17:53.239
[Frank] God damn it. Stop ripping.

17:54.323 --> 17:56.325
Fucking Charlie Brown.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.452
Bald loser who can't direct a play.

17:58.536 --> 17:59.787
[Sue] I'm all ready.

18:02.832 --> 18:05.876
Wow. Sue, you look beautiful.

18:06.627 --> 18:09.171
Thanks. Somebody today
told me I look fat.

18:09.255 --> 18:12.174
No, no, no. Who would say that?
You're gorgeous.

18:13.050 --> 18:14.343
Really?

18:14.427 --> 18:16.220
Yeah, come here.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.644
[phone rings]

18:23.728 --> 18:25.146
Does it ever fail?

18:25.229 --> 18:27.231
Let the machine pick it up.

18:27.315 --> 18:30.693
[robotic voice] <i>Leave a
message at the tone.</i>

18:30.776 --> 18:32.820
[beeps]

18:32.903 --> 18:36.699
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Murphy, this is
Vice Principal Eugene Menard...</i>

18:36.782 --> 18:38.576
Christ, what the fuck did Kevin do now?

18:38.659 --> 18:40.244
<i>...from Southwick Elementary.</i>

18:40.328 --> 18:42.121
Oh, don't tell me Bill's in trouble.

18:42.204 --> 18:45.041
<i>I need you to come to the
school as soon as you can</i>

18:45.124 --> 18:47.752
<i>to discuss a matter of some
importance about your daughter.</i>

18:47.835 --> 18:49.337
[both] Huh?

18:53.424 --> 18:55.926
Hi. Can we make this quick?

18:56.010 --> 18:57.845
It's our anniversary, and
we have a date planned.

18:57.928 --> 18:58.929
So... what is it?

18:59.013 --> 19:01.974
Lice, mumps, she kiss a boy?
Please tell me it's a boy.

19:02.058 --> 19:03.826
Mr. and Mrs. Murphy, we held a

19:03.851 --> 19:06.503
State Mathematics
Assessment Test recently.

19:06.562 --> 19:08.939
Maureen got a perfect score.

19:09.023 --> 19:10.191
That's wonderful!

19:10.274 --> 19:13.402
Yeah! You know, you could've
just told us on the phone.

19:14.362 --> 19:17.281
No girl has ever achieved that highly.

19:17.365 --> 19:20.660
Until five years ago, girls weren't
even allowed to take the test.

19:20.743 --> 19:22.578
It was believed to make them barren.

19:22.662 --> 19:25.831
So, obviously, Maureen cheated.

19:25.915 --> 19:28.209
Or she can never have children.

19:28.292 --> 19:29.710
You think she cheated?

19:29.794 --> 19:31.671
- You cheated?!
- No, I didn't!

19:31.754 --> 19:35.675
She sat next to the only other
student who got a perfect score.

19:35.758 --> 19:37.593
Scott, will you come in?

19:38.761 --> 19:40.554
This is Scott Ichikawa.

19:40.638 --> 19:43.265
As you can see, Scott is a boy.

19:43.349 --> 19:44.975
An Oriental boy.

19:45.059 --> 19:47.269
- They're really smart.
- How could you?!

19:47.353 --> 19:49.563
- I didn't cheat off him!
- Yes, you did!

19:49.647 --> 19:51.899
Aw, Christ, another kid down the drain.

19:51.982 --> 19:53.609
I am so sorry.

19:53.693 --> 19:56.320
This kind of thing never happened
when I was watching the kids.

19:56.404 --> 19:58.489
This is my fault? You're the
one who left her family.

19:58.572 --> 20:01.283
I had to work after you lost your job.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.244
Oh, well, happy anniversary to you, too.

20:03.327 --> 20:06.288
Not that you care about our anniversary.
You forgot it.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.916
And I got you a beautiful
ashtray made out of crystal.

20:08.999 --> 20:10.418
That's practically diamonds.

20:10.484 --> 20:12.616
If we could bring the discussion back

20:12.649 --> 20:13.987
to your daughter's cheating on a test.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.339
You should be thanking me.

20:15.423 --> 20:17.126
I got a job and kept this family fed

20:17.165 --> 20:18.283
when you weren't pulling your weight.

20:18.342 --> 20:20.177
I'm pulling my weight now!

20:20.446 --> 20:22.374
I bust my ass six nights a week,

20:22.399 --> 20:24.205
feeling every bump in the goddamn road

20:24.265 --> 20:27.435
because I provide a valuable service!
I make people happy!

20:27.518 --> 20:29.895
Well, you're not making me happy.

20:29.979 --> 20:31.439
I never see you.

20:31.522 --> 20:34.233
You're not my husband,
you're my roommate.

20:34.316 --> 20:37.027
You get home when I'm leaving.
You leave when I get home.

20:37.111 --> 20:40.239
You spend more time in that
stupid truck than you do with me!

20:40.322 --> 20:42.575
Well, at least the truck
doesn't judge me.

20:42.658 --> 20:45.619
You should be glad I called Rosie to
get that job, because now I can...

20:45.703 --> 20:47.163
Wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:47.246 --> 20:50.166
You told me you got that job
from the Employment Office.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.752
I never said that. I
said I went down there.

20:52.835 --> 20:55.045
- You said you got it from there!
- All right, I lied!

20:55.129 --> 20:57.590
I fucking lied! Is that
what you want to hear?

20:57.673 --> 20:59.633
No! Nobody wants to hear that!

20:59.717 --> 21:02.178
But I didn't take a handout!
I'm bringing money in!

21:02.237 --> 21:04.489
You took money from me!

21:04.597 --> 21:07.354
Why the fuck are you hiding
money from me anyways?

21:07.379 --> 21:08.854
I thought we were a team!

21:08.886 --> 21:11.979
I had to hide it so you wouldn't
blow it on another fucking TV!

21:12.069 --> 21:14.322
Oh! Oh! You're gonna
throw the TV in my face?

21:14.398 --> 21:15.793
I didn't hear you complaining when you

21:15.818 --> 21:17.493
were watching the Rose Bowl parade.

21:17.518 --> 21:20.605
"Ooh, Frank! Look at the begonias!"

21:20.630 --> 21:22.298
You stole from me!

21:22.592 --> 21:24.538
And because of that, I had to pawn that

21:24.563 --> 21:26.683
locket you gave to get
my invention made!

21:26.707 --> 21:29.293
You hocked our locket for
your little salad thing?!

21:29.376 --> 21:31.837
And you're busting my chops
about how I got my job?

21:31.921 --> 21:34.006
You know what? Just go!

21:34.089 --> 21:36.258
Never come home, for all I care!

21:36.342 --> 21:39.720
Be with your precious
truck and your rubbers!

21:39.804 --> 21:42.765
Well, if I had a rubber 15 years
ago, we wouldn't be here today!

21:42.848 --> 21:44.892
You said you had control!

21:44.975 --> 21:47.853
I said that in the missionary position!

21:47.937 --> 21:49.438
You're the one who turned over!

21:49.522 --> 21:52.107
Stop it! Stop yelling!

21:52.191 --> 21:54.819
Okay, okay, I cheated!

21:54.902 --> 21:56.570
I cheated off Maureen!

21:56.654 --> 21:59.281
She's the genius! I hate school!

21:59.990 --> 22:02.785
I'm the only one in my family
who doesn't like books!

22:02.868 --> 22:05.663
I want to ride motocross!

22:05.746 --> 22:10.584
They will call me Mr. Moto... Cross!

22:10.668 --> 22:12.920
Just let me go home!

22:13.003 --> 22:15.673
[Scott sobbing]

22:18.968 --> 22:20.052
Oh, my God.

22:23.681 --> 22:26.392
Now can I join computer club?

22:33.566 --> 22:36.277
Good fucking grief.

22:40.823 --> 22:43.534
[phone ringing]

22:45.953 --> 22:47.162
<i>Bob Pogo.</i>

22:47.246 --> 22:49.832
Bob, it's Frank Murphy, I didn't
think you'd be there this late.

22:49.915 --> 22:52.543
<i>- What do you want...</i>
- Please just hear me out.

22:52.626 --> 22:54.837
I'm sorry I left you on the
side of the road yesterday.

22:54.920 --> 22:58.215
If your offer to give me my job
back still stands, I'll do it.

22:58.963 --> 23:00.599
I'll help you take
down Scoop Dunbarton.

23:00.710 --> 23:02.484
You think I'd bring you back

23:02.553 --> 23:04.805
after what you did to me

23:04.888 --> 23:10.352
and that innocent Puerto Rican
who went to jail for our sins?

23:10.936 --> 23:15.107
Well, you're right, I would.
I got to get rid of Scoop!

23:15.190 --> 23:19.111
Thank you, Frank. I knew
you'd have pity on me.

23:19.194 --> 23:20.988
I'm not doing this for you.

23:21.071 --> 23:22.281
I need to save my marriage,

23:22.364 --> 23:24.700
and the only way to do that is
to get my old day job again.

23:24.783 --> 23:28.162
Meet me tomorrow. We
have no time to waste.

23:29.121 --> 23:31.415
Who wants ice cream?

23:31.498 --> 23:33.417
[Pogo] <i>No! It burns!</i>

23:33.500 --> 23:35.711
<i>The ice cream burns!</i>

23:39.548 --> 23:41.550
[thunder rumbles]

24:32.267 --> 24:34.228
A little rain?

24:34.311 --> 24:37.773
Is that all you got, you pussy?

24:38.315 --> 24:39.608
[thunder rumbles]
