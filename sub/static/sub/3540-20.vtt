00:02.168 --> 00:03.828
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:04.003 --> 00:05.937
For over a century, I've lived in secret.

00:06.105 --> 00:09.006
Until now. I know the risk.
But I have to know her.

00:09.175 --> 00:11.268
Elena, she's a dead ringer for Katherine.

00:11.444 --> 00:14.277
I want you all to myself.
Just as he wants me.

00:14.447 --> 00:16.381
I'm the one
who gets to make all rules.

00:16.549 --> 00:19.143
- Get the sheriff. We have a vampire.
- Don't take her.

00:19.318 --> 00:21.548
- You'll be killed.
- Then let me be killed.

00:22.388 --> 00:25.152
- Damon, we'll get her back.
- Don't you think you've done enough?

00:25.324 --> 00:26.518
Stefan's still drinking human blood.

00:27.860 --> 00:28.849
- Stefan.
Stefan.

00:29.295 --> 00:31.456
The blood brings out
what's inside of me.

00:31.631 --> 00:34.031
I'm not gonna give up on you.
I believe in you.

00:34.200 --> 00:37.169
Stop! Stop! Stop!

00:37.570 --> 00:40.562
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay. You're gonna be okay.

01:04.030 --> 01:05.190
Be careful.

01:15.408 --> 01:16.602
Get him in.

01:19.045 --> 01:21.036
We have to get to church.
They're waiting.

01:21.213 --> 01:24.842
Circle around that way.
I'll distract them. Go.

01:27.520 --> 01:32.048
Over here. There's another one.
Quick. Help me.

01:32.458 --> 01:33.925
Arm yourselves.

01:48.774 --> 01:49.934
We don't have long.

01:51.978 --> 01:54.913
Katherine. Katherine.

02:04.991 --> 02:06.481
We're gonna get you out of here.

02:08.127 --> 02:09.924
Damon, hurry. Hurry.

02:14.934 --> 02:18.165
No. No.

02:24.777 --> 02:26.369
Damon.

02:29.382 --> 02:31.407
Think we got one, sir.
I think we got one.

02:31.584 --> 02:33.814
Shoot him! Over here!

02:41.527 --> 02:43.017
We got him.

02:50.603 --> 02:53.595
Stefan. Stefan.

02:57.309 --> 02:59.140
Stefan.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.979
I love you, Stefan.

03:54.100 --> 03:56.330
It's so hard to see him locked up
like this.

03:56.502 --> 03:59.665
- You're the one who locked him up.
- You helped.

03:59.839 --> 04:01.898
I couldn't have him
chewing on people...

04:02.074 --> 04:04.599
...while the town was looking
for vampires, could I?

04:04.777 --> 04:06.745
Nothing to do with you
caring about him.

04:06.912 --> 04:09.210
Your thing, not mine.

04:54.794 --> 04:58.059
Katherine had me make that for you
weeks ago.

04:58.230 --> 05:01.393
- Where am I?
- The quarry, just north of town.

05:01.567 --> 05:03.728
My brother and I brought you here
last night.

05:04.470 --> 05:07.803
- We found you dead in the woods.
- Where's Damon?

05:18.250 --> 05:21.413
- Am I...? Am I a...?
- Not yet. You're in transition.

05:22.822 --> 05:24.346
But how? L...

05:24.557 --> 05:27.754
- Had Katherine's blood in your system.
- No. I never...

05:27.927 --> 05:30.589
She's been compelling you to drink it
for weeks, Stefan.

05:34.066 --> 05:36.796
- And Damon?
- No compulsion was necessary.

05:36.969 --> 05:39.460
He drank from her willingly.

06:02.127 --> 06:04.891
I woke up last night.
I didn't know where I was.

06:05.097 --> 06:07.463
I went to the church.

06:07.633 --> 06:09.658
And I watched them drag her inside.

06:12.204 --> 06:13.796
Then they set fire to it.

06:14.907 --> 06:17.740
And the whole church
went up into flames.

06:21.213 --> 06:22.703
They killed her, Stefan.

06:25.751 --> 06:27.685
She's gone.

06:33.893 --> 06:37.556
- Did you figure out what that is?
- Nope. Whatever it is, it doesn't work.

06:38.397 --> 06:39.887
Pearl didn't say anything else?

06:40.065 --> 06:44.331
Thought she was stealing his vampire
compass, but it was a pocket watch.

06:44.670 --> 06:48.071
That Johnathan Gilbert
was a crazy scientist.

06:49.408 --> 06:53.242
- Have you spoken to your uncle lately?
- I've been avoiding him, actually.

06:53.412 --> 06:57.781
- That, and I've been here most nights.
- So you'll be here again tonight?

06:58.717 --> 07:03.051
- Is that a problem?
- Yes. You're a complete nuisance.

07:04.456 --> 07:06.287
I'll see you later.

07:10.162 --> 07:12.392
- Okay, man.
- See you in a bit.

07:15.701 --> 07:17.396
Surprise.
- Heh.

07:17.569 --> 07:21.403
- What are you doing here?
- Picking up this.

07:23.042 --> 07:24.441
A class schedule?

07:24.610 --> 07:27.238
Starting tomorrow,
I'm officially a student here.

07:27.413 --> 07:32.112
- Wait, you're kidding me, right?
- No, I finally beat my mom down.

07:32.584 --> 07:36.384
But why would you wanna go
to high school? It blows.

07:36.555 --> 07:38.921
Do I really need to answer that?

07:42.828 --> 07:45.456
You'd suffer through all this
just to hang out with me?

07:46.332 --> 07:48.493
Yeah. I would.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.800
- That's, um...
- Stupid?

07:51.971 --> 07:55.202
Pathetic? Old lurky me?

07:56.075 --> 07:57.133
It's awesome.

08:00.245 --> 08:01.906
It's awesome.

08:10.122 --> 08:14.218
Brought you something to eat,
100 percent Stefan-diet approved.

08:15.627 --> 08:19.358
You know what'll happen if you don't
eat, you'll get all rotting and crusty.

08:19.531 --> 08:22.295
- I'm not hungry.
- Pfft. Of course you are.

08:22.468 --> 08:24.834
We're eternally hungry. Take it.

08:27.506 --> 08:29.269
The human blood
should be gone now.

08:29.441 --> 08:33.138
Wanna explain why you're still in here
feeling sorry for yourself?

08:34.179 --> 08:35.441
Come on. Drink up.

08:45.190 --> 08:48.023
Fine. Starve. What do I care?

08:53.132 --> 08:54.997
- Hello?
It's Alaric Saltzman.

08:55.167 --> 08:57.692
- How did you get this number?
- It's a mystery.

08:57.870 --> 09:02.170
Listen, I've been doing some digging
on Elena's uncle. You interested?

09:02.875 --> 09:05.241
- What kind of digging?
- An old friend from Duke...

09:05.411 --> 09:07.242
...who studied criminology there.

09:07.413 --> 09:09.904
Let's just say
he's become a very proficient digger.

09:10.082 --> 09:11.709
Well, did he find anything?

09:11.884 --> 09:14.682
Well, I had him run a track
on John's cell records.

09:14.853 --> 09:16.252
Getting a call from a number.

09:16.422 --> 09:18.754
The same number that Elena dialed
to get Isobel.

09:18.924 --> 09:22.758
- And then the number was disconnected.
- Isobel knows John. We knew that.

09:22.928 --> 09:24.896
He started getting calls
from a new number.

09:25.064 --> 09:28.192
And I had my friend run a geo-track.
Got the address.

09:28.367 --> 09:31.234
It's an apartment in Grove Hill.

09:31.904 --> 09:33.997
- Isobel's in Grove Hill?
- I don't know.

09:34.173 --> 09:37.233
- We could take a look, see what we find.
- Give me the address.

09:37.409 --> 09:39.900
So you can go without me?
No, I don't think so.

09:40.612 --> 09:43.103
- I'm not going with you. Tried to kill me.
- You did kill me.

09:45.117 --> 09:46.778
Hold on. What?

09:46.952 --> 09:50.217
I'm grabbing some clothes,
then I'll be right over. How's Stefan?

09:50.389 --> 09:52.755
Extra broody. Hold on.

09:52.925 --> 09:55.587
- You drive. Pick me up in an hour.
- Done.

09:58.430 --> 10:00.762
He won't eat anything.

10:00.933 --> 10:04.733
He has to eat.
What's his favorite kind of, um?

10:04.903 --> 10:08.964
- His favorite kind of what?
- Type of animal blood that he prefers?

10:09.374 --> 10:12.241
- Ew. Gross.
- Your joking doesn't help.

10:12.411 --> 10:14.038
Helps me. Now, hurry up.

10:14.213 --> 10:16.443
I can't babysit all night.
I have things to do.

10:16.615 --> 10:18.708
- I would say drop dead, but...
- Ha, ha, ha.

10:19.918 --> 10:23.410
Stefan likes puppy blood.

10:23.889 --> 10:26.357
Little golden retriever puppies,
cute, floppy ears.

10:26.758 --> 10:28.055
That's his favorite.

10:36.068 --> 10:38.969
- Sorry.
- Uncle John.

10:39.138 --> 10:40.571
I didn't see you there.

10:40.739 --> 10:43.674
I thought we could talk.
We haven't had a chance to catch up.

10:44.977 --> 10:48.378
- I'm actually just heading out, so...
- Well, it won't take long.

10:51.083 --> 10:53.142
What did you wanna talk about?

10:55.587 --> 10:57.077
I know you know.

10:57.789 --> 11:00.917
- Know what?
- It's really silly to keep pretending.

11:01.760 --> 11:04.251
What do you think
your mother would say...

11:04.429 --> 11:06.522
...if she knew
you were dating a vampire?

11:08.934 --> 11:10.925
Which mother?

11:25.717 --> 11:28.948
I bet Johnathan Gilbert
has told Father by now.

11:29.521 --> 11:31.648
Wonder how he took the news
that we're dead.

11:31.823 --> 11:34.792
As if he cares. He betrayed us.

11:34.960 --> 11:38.862
He thought he was protecting us, Damon.
He thought he was protecting this town.

11:39.031 --> 11:42.330
God, the sun hurts my eyes.

11:42.501 --> 11:44.332
It's part of it.

11:44.836 --> 11:46.565
The muscle aches, the sick feeling.

11:47.072 --> 11:52.203
Emily says it's our bodies pushing us
to feed, to complete the transition.

11:53.011 --> 11:56.003
- That's not gonna happen.
- Is that your choice then?

11:57.249 --> 12:00.343
- To die instead?
- Isn't it yours?

12:02.020 --> 12:04.250
This was all to be with Katherine.

12:04.456 --> 12:05.946
But she's gone.

12:06.692 --> 12:08.489
I want it over.

12:11.563 --> 12:15.897
How you feeling?
Damon says you need to drink that.

12:18.670 --> 12:20.570
You need it, Stefan.

12:20.739 --> 12:23.230
- Can't survive without it.
- I don't wanna survive.

12:23.909 --> 12:25.376
What?

12:25.911 --> 12:27.845
- No, don't say that.
- I'm sorry, Elena.

12:28.013 --> 12:29.412
No more.

12:29.881 --> 12:32.873
After what I've done, it has to end.

12:34.086 --> 12:36.020
I just want it over.

12:43.061 --> 12:45.689
He's being dramatic.
He's not gonna starve himself.

12:45.864 --> 12:47.354
Why would he say that?

12:47.532 --> 12:51.093
He feels bad about hurting that girl.
It's typical Stefan martyr stuff.

12:51.270 --> 12:52.897
- It will pass.
- Will it?

12:53.405 --> 12:56.101
Because he seemed to be
in a lot of pain.

12:56.275 --> 12:57.867
That will pass, once he eats.

12:58.644 --> 13:01.738
- I didn't mean physical pain.
- I know what you meant.

13:02.914 --> 13:06.372
Are you okay if I have to run out?
I have an errand with the teacher.

13:07.219 --> 13:09.779
The teacher? Alaric?

13:09.955 --> 13:12.788
- Are you two friends now?
- I don't have any friends, Elena.

13:14.559 --> 13:16.083
Right.

13:16.662 --> 13:19.460
You should... You should stay up here.

13:19.631 --> 13:22.623
- Shouldn't be down there by yourself.
- I'll be fine.

13:22.801 --> 13:24.393
You know...

13:24.970 --> 13:28.133
...you're very trusting of him,
given the circumstances.

13:28.307 --> 13:30.241
So are you.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.437
Otherwise, you wouldn't be leaving.

13:35.080 --> 13:36.741
I won't be long.

13:49.094 --> 13:50.254
Hello, Mr. Gilbert.

13:50.762 --> 13:52.559
Pearl. What a pleasure.

13:53.131 --> 13:55.258
I must admit,
I'm surprised that you came.

13:55.434 --> 13:58.995
Jenna tells me you wanted to discuss
the sale of the building in person.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.196
Revealing yourself to me,
it took a risk.

14:01.873 --> 14:03.500
I'm not stupid, Mr. Gilbert.

14:03.875 --> 14:06.969
You knew who I was
when you requested the meeting.

14:07.846 --> 14:11.009
Damon tells me you're looking for
the device I took from Johnathan.

14:11.883 --> 14:14.875
I'm sure you realize I have no intention
of giving it to you.

14:15.087 --> 14:18.579
That's why I wanted to meet you.
I'm planning on changing your mind.

14:19.124 --> 14:21.115
Really? How so?

14:21.293 --> 14:22.988
With my Gilbert charm.

14:23.662 --> 14:26.392
I know that you have a weakness
for it.

14:28.100 --> 14:29.226
May I buy you a drink?

14:32.738 --> 14:35.002
Your mother was in love
with Johnathan Gilbert.

14:35.173 --> 14:37.835
- And he betrayed her?
- Yup.

14:38.009 --> 14:41.536
And now my Uncle John
wants this invention-device thing...

14:41.713 --> 14:43.305
...that she gave to Damon.

14:44.149 --> 14:45.912
That's pretty much it.

14:46.251 --> 14:48.048
John mentioned more Gilbert journals.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.688
I bet that's how he knows everything.

14:51.857 --> 14:56.157
Do we have to talk about this all night?
I've told you everything.

14:56.895 --> 15:00.387
I probably shouldn't have.
That could get us both in a lot of trouble.

15:01.933 --> 15:03.332
I'm not gonna say anything.

15:04.569 --> 15:06.264
Your Uncle John wants us dead.

15:06.671 --> 15:07.899
Oh, you don't know that.

15:09.341 --> 15:10.638
Yes, I do.

15:11.143 --> 15:13.941
- He's a hater, Jeremy.
- Well, I'm not.

15:15.046 --> 15:16.673
No.

15:16.848 --> 15:18.338
You're something else entirely.

15:18.517 --> 15:20.576
Oh, yeah? What would that be?

15:22.387 --> 15:24.252
My weakness.

15:54.219 --> 15:58.553
- I don't want Jenna to walk in on us.
- Jenna's in the kitchen.

15:58.723 --> 16:01.749
- She just opened the refrigerator.
- Wait. You can hear that?

16:04.396 --> 16:05.920
That is so cool.

16:08.934 --> 16:13.166
This is the one here. The records show
this was paid three months in advance.

16:13.338 --> 16:17.138
This is where it gets tricky.
I may or may not be able to get in.

16:17.309 --> 16:19.834
How does that work?
You always have to be invited in?

16:20.011 --> 16:22.172
By the owner
or the person of entitlement.

16:22.347 --> 16:25.510
Short-term rentals and hotels
are a bit of a gray area.

16:25.717 --> 16:27.082
You gotta play it by ear.

16:29.821 --> 16:33.257
- Could we not kill anyone tonight?
- Brought me along for my company?

16:39.998 --> 16:42.330
It doesn't look like anyone's home.

16:44.169 --> 16:46.797
Yeah. I'm good.

16:47.973 --> 16:50.271
No permanent resident, apparently.

16:58.550 --> 17:00.814
Uh, Ric, we have company.

17:11.029 --> 17:12.894
Boys, boys, boys, that's enough.

17:14.833 --> 17:15.959
I know you.

17:17.402 --> 17:19.063
- Damon?
- Your name is Henry.

17:19.271 --> 17:21.000
- You were in the tomb.
- Yes, sir.

17:23.141 --> 17:25.075
What are you doing here?

17:42.394 --> 17:44.328
May I offer you a drink, Mr. Gilbert?

17:44.496 --> 17:45.895
Thank you, Mr. Salvatore.

17:46.731 --> 17:48.358
This won't take much longer.

17:50.869 --> 17:53.030
I wanna make sure
the archives are accurate.

17:53.204 --> 17:56.105
Be sure you document
the loss of civilian life in the church.

17:56.308 --> 17:58.242
They were hardly civilians,
Mr. Salvatore.

17:59.244 --> 18:01.678
As far as anyone
needs to know, they were.

18:01.846 --> 18:05.907
As record keeper for council, what you
write will be passed through generations.

18:06.084 --> 18:08.211
Details should be kept
between you and me.

18:08.386 --> 18:11.184
- For example?
- My sons.

18:11.957 --> 18:15.518
They'll be remembered as innocent
victims of the battle of Willow Creek...

18:15.694 --> 18:17.286
...not for their shame.

18:17.462 --> 18:19.020
Certainly, Mr. Salvatore.

18:26.071 --> 18:29.040
You know,
Damon hasn't fed me vervain in a while.

18:29.207 --> 18:31.869
I could be at those bars in a flash,
and you'd be dead.

18:32.043 --> 18:33.977
Yeah, you could...

18:34.579 --> 18:38.345
...but you won't.
- Please just go away.

18:38.984 --> 18:40.747
I don't want you here.

18:48.493 --> 18:51.553
- What are you doing? Get out of here.
- No.

18:51.730 --> 18:55.427
- You're taking a risk. I could hurt you.
- Then I'm stupid.

18:56.101 --> 18:58.296
You need to drink this.

18:58.470 --> 19:01.564
- Elena, get out of here or you'll regret it.
- Drink.

19:03.174 --> 19:06.371
I said get out!

19:08.146 --> 19:09.374
No.

19:33.905 --> 19:36.874
So how do you know John Gilbert?

19:37.042 --> 19:41.308
Well, I've known him for years.
A good friend. How do you know him?

19:41.913 --> 19:45.314
I met him right after I got out
of the tomb. He's been helping me out.

19:45.483 --> 19:48.213
- Helping you out how?
Adapting.

19:48.687 --> 19:49.984
It's a whole new world.

19:50.155 --> 19:52.783
Cars, computers, match. Com.

19:52.957 --> 19:56.154
There's so much to learn.
He helped me get this place.

19:57.629 --> 20:00.723
So do you live here alone,
or is there someone else here?

20:01.933 --> 20:06.370
That's my friend's very
passive-aggressive way of asking...

20:06.538 --> 20:08.472
...do you know a woman
named Isobel?

20:08.640 --> 20:12.167
Uh, no. No, I don't know an Isobel.
I know John.

20:12.343 --> 20:13.833
He's my only real friend.

20:14.012 --> 20:15.240
He showed me the ropes.

20:15.447 --> 20:18.211
How to use a microwave,
separate my whites.

20:18.383 --> 20:21.944
- What else do you do?
- Keep an eye on things. With the others.

20:22.587 --> 20:24.179
- The others?
- From the tomb.

20:25.156 --> 20:28.023
Pissed at the founding families
for trying to burn them.

20:28.193 --> 20:30.559
I'm cool, but those tomb boys,
they want revenge.

20:30.729 --> 20:33.926
- What does John want with them?
- He's just keeping an eye on them.

20:34.099 --> 20:36.897
- Make sure they stay out of trouble.
- Well, that's John.

20:37.068 --> 20:38.695
He's such a do-gooder.

20:42.240 --> 20:43.867
That's John now.

20:44.042 --> 20:47.170
- Hey, let me talk to him.
- All right. Yeah.

20:52.917 --> 20:56.478
- Are you gonna answer that?
- Am I gonna answer that?

20:59.891 --> 21:01.415
What's going on?

21:15.240 --> 21:17.435
"Let's not kill anyone tonight. "

21:17.609 --> 21:20.772
Your words. Just pointing that out.

21:21.813 --> 21:24.611
- My apologies.
- No apologies necessary.

21:25.583 --> 21:28.984
So tell me, Mr. Gilbert,
why should I let you have the device?

21:29.154 --> 21:31.748
Because I can help you.
I'm connected around here.

21:31.923 --> 21:33.720
Town council's eating out of my hand.

21:33.892 --> 21:35.291
They do whatever I say.

21:35.460 --> 21:39.658
I know you just wanna live your life
with a picket fence, I can help you.

21:39.831 --> 21:42.163
The device doesn't work.
Why would you want it?

21:42.333 --> 21:44.460
It's a family heirloom.
Call me sentimental.

21:45.303 --> 21:46.998
Johnathan was ahead of his time.

21:47.172 --> 21:49.402
I read his journals.
They're very extensive.

21:49.574 --> 21:53.476
He actually wrote about you.
You were his one regret.

21:54.245 --> 21:57.305
He loved you and he hated himself
for what he did to you.

21:58.983 --> 22:00.280
- You're lying.
- No.

22:00.618 --> 22:03.849
On his last days,
he wrote how sorry he was.

22:05.690 --> 22:07.658
You were the only woman
he ever loved.

22:15.366 --> 22:20.099
Good God. You vampires,
you're so emotional.

22:20.271 --> 22:22.171
Johnathan Gilbert hated you.

22:22.707 --> 22:26.143
His only regret was he didn't drive
a stake through your heart himself.

22:29.881 --> 22:31.872
- I gave it to Damon.
- What?

22:32.083 --> 22:35.780
I gave your device to Damon.
Why don't you ask him for it yourself?

22:35.954 --> 22:37.717
He'd be delighted to give it to you.

22:37.889 --> 22:41.222
And then, Mr. Gilbert,
may you rot in hell.

22:45.830 --> 22:47.388
Talk to me, Stefan.

22:47.599 --> 22:49.032
Why are you doing this?

22:49.200 --> 22:53.296
I'm making the decision
I should have made years ago.

22:53.471 --> 22:55.598
What are you talking about?

22:56.975 --> 22:59.341
You have to feed to complete
the transition.

23:00.245 --> 23:01.837
I know that.

23:03.248 --> 23:05.375
It was a choice I shouldn't have made.

23:15.760 --> 23:17.091
Dear God.

23:17.262 --> 23:19.696
Even in our death,
you only feel shame?

23:19.864 --> 23:21.991
- You're one of them now.
- No.

23:22.166 --> 23:24.100
Father, I came to say goodbye.

23:24.269 --> 23:25.531
I watched you die.

23:26.905 --> 23:28.532
You were there when we were shot?

23:28.706 --> 23:30.537
I pulled the trigger myself.

23:31.376 --> 23:32.775
You killed your own sons?

23:32.944 --> 23:35.913
You were dead to me the moment
you sided with the vampires.

23:36.080 --> 23:38.913
I thank God your mother isn't alive
to see the disgrace.

23:39.083 --> 23:43.019
I haven't turned yet. I don't want to.
I'm going to let myself die, Father.

23:43.187 --> 23:44.415
Yes, you are.

23:51.763 --> 23:54.391
No. Oh, God, Father. I didn't mean to.

23:54.565 --> 23:57.363
- Get away from me.
- No, let me help you. Please.

24:37.942 --> 24:40.604
Oh, God. What's happening to me?

24:46.784 --> 24:48.945
How can you even look at me
right now?

24:49.420 --> 24:52.355
You need to be able talk
about these things, Stefan.

24:52.523 --> 24:54.582
I need to hear them.

24:56.294 --> 24:57.625
Come upstairs.

24:57.795 --> 25:01.424
We can talk about it more and we'll
keep talking as long as you need.

25:03.868 --> 25:05.733
You're so sure I'm ready.

25:12.510 --> 25:14.307
And when you feel the same way...

25:16.347 --> 25:17.644
...I'll be upstairs.

25:31.629 --> 25:33.790
- Find anything yet?
No, I looked everywhere.

25:33.965 --> 25:36.525
The places is... The place is clean.

25:36.701 --> 25:39.499
Well, I found this behind the blood,
in the fridge.

25:41.773 --> 25:43.673
Oh, man, this was a real dead-end.

25:43.841 --> 25:45.570
I wouldn't beat myself over it, man.

25:46.177 --> 25:48.407
What'd you think you were gonna find,
huh?

25:48.579 --> 25:51.548
Isobel with a cigar and slippers?

25:54.585 --> 25:57.383
Oh, man. L...

25:57.989 --> 25:59.547
I gotta stop this. I can't...

25:59.724 --> 26:01.351
I can't keep searching for her.

26:01.526 --> 26:03.016
Really? After only two years?

26:03.528 --> 26:05.393
That's actually...

26:06.230 --> 26:08.221
...moderately healthy.

26:08.399 --> 26:10.731
What are you going on?
A hundred and forty-six.

26:10.902 --> 26:13.666
I figured the 200-mark is probably
a good stopping point.

26:18.309 --> 26:20.038
I mean, no answer is enough.

26:20.211 --> 26:23.612
I keep thinking I wanna know why,
when, you know, the precise moment...

26:23.815 --> 26:28.013
...when my wife decided
life with me wasn't enough.

26:29.053 --> 26:31.317
She charmed me, your wife, Isobel.

26:32.056 --> 26:33.250
She talked a good game.

26:33.424 --> 26:36.120
She was smart.
She had this excitement in her eyes.

26:36.627 --> 26:40.529
Should have known there was something
different about her, tie to Katherine.

26:40.698 --> 26:44.361
- Had to be some reason I didn't kill her.
- Enough. I don't wanna hear anymore.

26:45.570 --> 26:49.472
I don't wanna waste any more of my life
searching for answers that I don't want.

26:51.976 --> 26:54.137
I'm through with Isobel. L...

26:55.613 --> 26:58.446
I'm done with all of this.

26:59.717 --> 27:01.651
Yeah.

27:12.597 --> 27:14.064
Hey.

27:15.466 --> 27:18.629
- What's the matter?
- Pack your things. We're leaving.

27:18.803 --> 27:19.895
What? No.

27:20.071 --> 27:22.835
I was wrong to think
that we could make a home here.

27:23.007 --> 27:24.474
It's time for us to move on.

27:24.642 --> 27:26.974
But I don't wanna move on.
I wanna stay.

27:27.145 --> 27:31.275
We can't stay. There's too many people
here who know the truth.

27:31.449 --> 27:32.643
Too much history.

27:32.817 --> 27:35.945
So, what, you're just gonna give up,
pack us up, and move us out?

27:36.454 --> 27:38.513
It's not safe here. You know that.

27:38.956 --> 27:40.514
Please.

27:41.626 --> 27:43.526
- This is about Jeremy.
- No.

27:43.694 --> 27:47.425
It's about me finally getting
to build a life for myself.

27:48.032 --> 27:49.431
Please, Mama.

27:49.600 --> 27:53.331
You gave me my life back.
I am just trying to protect yours.

27:55.706 --> 27:57.970
I can't force you.

27:58.176 --> 28:00.007
It's your decision.

28:06.684 --> 28:09.312
Uch. God. You're still here?

28:09.487 --> 28:12.115
- Were you expecting anything else?
- No.

28:13.991 --> 28:16.516
So how was the errand?

28:16.694 --> 28:18.321
Futile.

28:18.496 --> 28:21.897
Although I think I witnessed the teacher
having an existential crisis.

28:22.066 --> 28:24.864
- Has Stefan eaten yet?
- I thought you didn't care.

28:25.536 --> 28:27.470
Chalk it up to morbid curiosity.

28:28.506 --> 28:30.565
I think he's getting there.

28:30.741 --> 28:33.141
He's got a lot of guilt
that he has to deal with.

28:33.311 --> 28:36.576
And it doesn't help that you've spent
the last 145 years...

28:36.747 --> 28:39.045
...punishing him for Katherine
getting caught.

28:39.450 --> 28:42.078
- This is my fault now?
- No, it's no one's fault, Damon.

28:42.253 --> 28:45.245
I'm just saying
you're not exactly innocent.

28:46.157 --> 28:48.717
You've made your life's mission
to make him miserable.

28:51.963 --> 28:53.191
Let me ask you a question.

28:53.364 --> 28:57.027
In this important soul-searching and
cleansing of demons of Stefan's past...

28:57.201 --> 28:59.328
...did you ever manage
to get the story?

29:00.204 --> 29:04.072
- He said there was more.
- Yeah. That's an understatement.

29:04.475 --> 29:05.533
Damon.

29:05.710 --> 29:07.701
Damon.

29:08.412 --> 29:09.538
Tell me.

29:20.491 --> 29:22.891
What are you doing?
Who is that?

29:23.894 --> 29:27.091
I brought her for you. She's a gift.

29:27.265 --> 29:28.527
Have a seat, please.

29:32.803 --> 29:36.762
- What have you done, Stefan?
- Damon, I've been to see Father.

29:36.941 --> 29:38.033
He came at me.

29:39.010 --> 29:42.377
I didn't know my own strength.
There was blood everywhere.

29:42.546 --> 29:44.776
He was dying
and the blood was too strong.

29:45.883 --> 29:47.145
I needed it.

29:47.318 --> 29:48.808
- I had to have it.
- You fed.

29:49.020 --> 29:50.817
Yes. And it's incredible.

29:51.022 --> 29:54.116
My body is exploding with power,
Damon.

29:54.558 --> 29:56.753
- No.
- I can hear things from far away.

29:57.261 --> 30:00.822
I can see through the darkness.
I can move like it's magic.

30:01.032 --> 30:05.469
And the guilt, the pain, Damon,
I can turn it off like a switch.

30:05.636 --> 30:08.571
Katherine was right.
It's another world out there, Damon.

30:09.340 --> 30:11.638
Katherine is dead, Stefan.

30:11.809 --> 30:15.438
- There's no world without her.
- No, but you can turn that off too.

30:15.613 --> 30:17.513
You don't have to feel pain anymore.

30:17.682 --> 30:18.944
I don't want it.

30:19.116 --> 30:23.450
You're weak. You'll be dead soon.
You need this.

30:24.055 --> 30:27.616
- You'll die.
- No. I can't.

30:28.159 --> 30:29.456
Please.

30:41.839 --> 30:44.433
- I won't let you die.
- No. I can't.

30:44.608 --> 30:45.939
Don't fight it.

30:46.477 --> 30:49.173
We can do this together.

31:23.481 --> 31:28.418
The moment Stefan had his first taste of
human blood, he was a different person.

31:28.853 --> 31:31.549
I suppose I should thank him.
It's been a hell of a ride.

31:33.357 --> 31:36.326
Oh, my God.
He said he wanted to die.

31:36.494 --> 31:39.019
That's why he won't feed.
Now I understand why, but...

31:39.497 --> 31:40.623
His choice.

31:41.665 --> 31:44.190
If he's stupid enough to make it,
so be it.

31:44.869 --> 31:48.862
Don't do that, okay?
Don't pretend like you don't care.

31:50.775 --> 31:52.003
Where are you going?

32:24.675 --> 32:25.733
Hey.

32:25.910 --> 32:28.242
It's getting impossible
to sneak up on you.

32:28.679 --> 32:30.169
Nice try, though.

32:31.215 --> 32:32.807
Sorry I woke you.

32:32.983 --> 32:34.951
That's okay.

32:35.119 --> 32:37.280
You only woke me halfway.

32:41.592 --> 32:43.958
So listen.

32:44.128 --> 32:46.187
- I...
- That feels good.

33:05.015 --> 33:06.243
Goodbye.

33:29.974 --> 33:31.339
How do you feel?

33:31.509 --> 33:33.443
Whew. You were right.

33:33.611 --> 33:35.044
It is a whole new world.

33:35.613 --> 33:37.171
We can explore it together.

33:40.150 --> 33:43.642
You got what you wanted.
You and me for all eternity.

33:44.755 --> 33:46.780
But hear this, brother.

33:47.691 --> 33:49.659
I will make it an eternity...

33:50.461 --> 33:52.952
...of misery for you.

33:54.865 --> 33:56.389
Damon.

34:07.545 --> 34:09.376
You've transitioned.

34:11.549 --> 34:13.072
You'd have rather found me dead?

34:13.284 --> 34:15.309
Katherine saved my life once.

34:15.485 --> 34:16.714
I owed her.

34:16.887 --> 34:19.219
That doesn't mean
I'd wish her curse on anyone.

34:21.225 --> 34:22.715
It feels more like a gift.

34:23.293 --> 34:25.989
- That will change.
- Why is that?

34:30.935 --> 34:34.871
Because even in death,
your heart is pure, Stefan.

34:35.873 --> 34:38.341
I sense that about you.

34:40.244 --> 34:42.235
That will be your curse.

34:44.248 --> 34:46.045
Emily, wait.

34:54.725 --> 34:55.885
Stefan.

35:01.599 --> 35:03.726
Damon told me the rest of the story.

35:04.368 --> 35:06.802
I thought I might find you here.

35:06.971 --> 35:09.064
I should have died that night...

35:10.040 --> 35:12.338
...just like I had chosen.

35:13.544 --> 35:17.241
- I should have let Damon die too.
- But you didn't.

35:17.414 --> 35:21.544
And if you die now,
it's not gonna change what happened.

35:22.853 --> 35:25.651
Every single person that's been hurt...

35:26.457 --> 35:29.585
...every single life that's been lost,
it's because of me.

35:34.732 --> 35:37.223
The night that my parents died...

35:38.168 --> 35:41.729
...I blew off family night
so that I could go to some party.

35:41.905 --> 35:45.432
I ended up getting stranded,
and they had to come pick me up.

35:45.609 --> 35:48.806
That's why we ended up in the car
at Wickery Bridge.

35:48.979 --> 35:50.640
And that's why they died.

35:52.516 --> 35:56.077
Our actions are what set things
in motion.

35:56.887 --> 35:58.787
But we have to live with that.

36:03.293 --> 36:05.124
I made a choice, Elena.

36:05.295 --> 36:08.321
And because of that choice,
a lot of people were hurt.

36:08.499 --> 36:12.265
You also made a choice to stop, to reject
the person that the blood made you.

36:12.436 --> 36:15.132
- You made a choice to be good.
- No. Please don't do that.

36:15.305 --> 36:18.536
That's the person who jumped
in the water to save the family...

36:18.709 --> 36:21.542
...whose car had driven off the bridge.
- Don't make this okay.

36:21.712 --> 36:23.680
That's the person who saved my life.

36:23.847 --> 36:26.281
- You don't understand, Elena.
- Then tell me.

36:26.450 --> 36:27.712
It hurts me.

36:27.918 --> 36:30.785
It hurts me, knowing what I've done,
and that pain...

36:30.954 --> 36:32.785
...that pain is with me all the time.

36:33.157 --> 36:35.682
And every day, I think that if I just...

36:36.126 --> 36:41.462
If I just give myself over to the blood,
I can make that pain stop.

36:41.632 --> 36:44.294
It would be that easy,
and every day, I fight that.

36:45.469 --> 36:47.994
And I am so terrified that one day...

36:48.172 --> 36:50.436
...I'm not gonna wanna fight anymore,
Elena.

36:51.675 --> 36:53.233
The next time I hurt somebody...

36:56.313 --> 36:59.214
...it could be you.
- There will be no next time.

36:59.383 --> 37:02.375
- You don't know that.
- Maybe I don't.

37:04.188 --> 37:06.053
But what I do know...

37:06.724 --> 37:08.658
...is that you can take this...

37:08.826 --> 37:11.556
...throw it in the quarry,
and let the sun rise.

37:12.196 --> 37:14.721
Or you could take this ring
and put it on.

37:14.898 --> 37:17.059
And keep fighting.

37:30.481 --> 37:32.278
It's your choice.

37:43.360 --> 37:44.725
Elena.

38:22.132 --> 38:24.123
- Thank you, Harper.
- You're welcome.

38:24.301 --> 38:26.064
Annabel should be back in a minute.

38:26.236 --> 38:28.602
You don't have to come with us
if you don't want to.

38:28.772 --> 38:32.469
This was never my home, Miss Pearl.
I was just a soldier who was left to die.

38:32.643 --> 38:34.941
You saved me. I'm coming with you.

38:36.113 --> 38:38.240
Let me help you with these.

39:03.273 --> 39:04.604
Little boy lost.

39:06.643 --> 39:08.338
- I'll be upstairs, okay?
- Okay.

39:09.947 --> 39:11.938
Good night, Damon.

39:18.488 --> 39:20.888
- Thank you.
- No, Stefan, thank you.

39:21.091 --> 39:23.389
You're back on Bambi blood,
I'm the badass again.

39:23.594 --> 39:26.859
- All is right in the world.
- I mean it.

39:27.030 --> 39:28.622
Thank you.

39:28.799 --> 39:31.393
For helping her take care of me.

39:31.602 --> 39:34.571
You brood too much. Everything
on this planet's not your fault.

39:34.738 --> 39:37.206
My actions, what I do, not your fault.
I own them.

39:37.374 --> 39:40.969
They belong to me.
You are not allowed to feel my guilt.

39:41.979 --> 39:43.105
Do you feel guilt?

39:44.147 --> 39:47.480
If I wanted to, it's there.

39:58.495 --> 39:59.985
Emily waited till I turned...

40:00.163 --> 40:03.564
...to tell me she'd been successful
protecting Katherine with her spell.

40:03.734 --> 40:05.827
She didn't want me to know
about the tomb.

40:06.003 --> 40:07.937
She thought
it would impact my decision.

40:08.138 --> 40:10.163
She didn't want either one of us
to turn.

40:10.340 --> 40:11.705
She said it was a curse.

40:12.276 --> 40:15.507
Witches. Judgy little things.

40:16.580 --> 40:19.174
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't want you to know.

40:19.349 --> 40:21.510
Because I hated you, and I still do.

40:22.953 --> 40:24.181
I know.

40:24.354 --> 40:26.686
But not because you forced me
to turn.

40:27.758 --> 40:28.918
Then why?

40:34.298 --> 40:35.697
Because she turned you.

40:37.601 --> 40:40.161
It was just supposed to be me,
Stefan.

40:41.104 --> 40:42.196
Just me.

40:47.744 --> 40:49.678
I'm back.

40:55.552 --> 40:57.110
Mama.

41:02.726 --> 41:05.820
No, please don't leave me again.
No. Please wake up.

41:05.996 --> 41:08.965
You have to wake up. No.

41:20.777 --> 41:23.337
Sheriff Forbes, it's John Gilbert.

41:23.513 --> 41:25.504
Sorry to call so late.

41:25.716 --> 41:28.082
I have an update about the vampires.

41:38.462 --> 41:40.259
Hello, Ric.

41:49.606 --> 41:51.267
Isobel.
