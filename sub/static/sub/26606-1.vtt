01:47.200 --> 01:48.830
- Alrighty guys we are about

01:48.830 --> 01:50.150
to head out for the night.

01:50.150 --> 01:51.300
We're going to the bar.

01:52.404 --> 01:54.914
Just checking in on Brody
who's fixing a lightbulb.

01:54.914 --> 01:55.747
What's good?

01:55.747 --> 01:56.972
- Hey babe.

01:56.972 --> 01:57.805
- What you doing?

01:57.805 --> 01:59.700
- Just fixing that light bulb
that you said was flickering.

01:59.700 --> 02:01.623
- Okay, but why's it red?

02:02.570 --> 02:04.690
- Sorry, it's the only one we had.

02:04.690 --> 02:06.140
- You checked in the garage?

02:06.140 --> 02:07.771
- I checked everywhere, trust em.

02:07.771 --> 02:09.090
- You really checked the garage?

02:09.090 --> 02:10.330
- I checked everywhere.

02:10.330 --> 02:12.198
- Okay, well Brody,

02:12.198 --> 02:13.031
I don't want the neighbors thinking

02:13.031 --> 02:14.200
that we live in a porn house.

02:14.200 --> 02:15.763
- Oh, what's wrong with that?

02:16.860 --> 02:19.220
- Ha, ha, ha, ha, I'm recording.

02:19.220 --> 02:20.650
- You serious?

02:20.650 --> 02:21.559
- Yes.

02:21.559 --> 02:22.590
- Oh fuck.

02:22.590 --> 02:24.720
- Okay, well
we need to get another one,

02:24.720 --> 02:26.868
tomorrow morning, promise.

02:26.868 --> 02:28.560
- I won't, well I can't
promise tomorrow morning

02:28.560 --> 02:31.060
because we're gonna have a late night.

02:31.060 --> 02:32.310
- Oh my god.

02:32.310 --> 02:33.845
- A fun late night.

02:33.845 --> 02:34.851
- You're so embarrassing.

02:34.851 --> 02:36.100
- Especially when we come home.

02:36.100 --> 02:38.023
- Again I'm recording.

02:39.210 --> 02:40.779
- You love it.

02:40.779 --> 02:42.760
- Yeah, uh huh,
I'm such a lucky lady.

02:42.760 --> 02:44.620
Alright, well fix that tomorrow

02:44.620 --> 02:46.980
because like I said it's not Christmas

02:46.980 --> 02:49.630
and we're not porn stars so.

02:49.630 --> 02:50.463
And get your jacket on

02:50.463 --> 02:51.730
'cause it's cold outside, I'm ready to go.

02:51.730 --> 02:52.630
- Got you babe.
- Alright.

02:52.630 --> 02:54.185
- I'll be a minute.

02:54.185 --> 02:55.018
- Okay, thank you.

02:56.341 --> 02:58.137
Now I've just gotta check my hair

02:58.137 --> 02:59.290
and see how that's looking.

02:59.290 --> 03:00.123
Let's see.

03:02.219 --> 03:05.452
Oh, I just curled it are you kidding me?

03:05.452 --> 03:07.170
Alright, well you know what,

03:07.170 --> 03:08.520
we've gotta leave anyway.

03:08.520 --> 03:10.800
We're meeting them in like
less than half an hour,

03:10.800 --> 03:12.130
so we gotta head out.

03:12.130 --> 03:14.480
Alrighty guys we are good to go

03:14.480 --> 03:17.540
and I will keep you updated in the future.

03:17.540 --> 03:19.100
Alright we're here.

03:19.100 --> 03:20.263
The Irish Pub.

03:21.364 --> 03:22.360
- I can't wait.

03:22.360 --> 03:23.324
- I know it's freezing.

03:23.324 --> 03:24.190
Let's get inside I'm cold.

03:24.190 --> 03:25.190
- Absolutely.

03:25.190 --> 03:29.697
- It's
so windy out here, my god.

03:31.737 --> 03:32.800
- I think they
have a jukebox in here.

03:32.800 --> 03:34.450
- That means
you're picking music?

03:34.450 --> 03:35.979
- Absolutely.

03:35.979 --> 03:37.670
- Oh.

03:37.670 --> 03:40.150
Alrighty, we're about to meet everybody.

03:40.150 --> 03:42.050
They should be all here.

03:42.050 --> 03:43.971
And there they are, hi guys.

03:43.971 --> 03:45.371
- Hey, hi.

03:45.371 --> 03:46.310
- How are you?
- How are you?

03:46.310 --> 03:47.656
- I'm good.

03:47.656 --> 03:49.638
Hello.
- How are you?

03:49.638 --> 03:51.271
- Nothing much, hi Neil.

03:51.271 --> 03:52.551
- Hey what's up guys.

03:52.551 --> 03:53.543

03:53.543 --> 03:54.376
- Yo, what up?

03:54.376 --> 03:55.324
- Nothing much.

03:55.324 --> 03:56.157

03:56.157 --> 03:57.736
- Good to see you.
- Good seeing you.

03:57.736 --> 03:59.164
Matt what's up buddy, you alright?

03:59.164 --> 04:02.053
- Guys sit down,

04:03.657 --> 04:04.513
- Do we need to say hi?

04:04.513 --> 04:06.358
- Alright you two get in here, say hello.

04:06.358 --> 04:07.440
- Hi.
- Hello.

04:07.440 --> 04:08.802
- Hi guys, it's a video wave.

04:10.164 --> 04:11.250
Oh my god, perfect.

04:11.250 --> 04:14.390
Look at my beautiful friend Maria.

04:14.390 --> 04:16.083
Look how pretty.

04:16.083 --> 04:19.290
Ready guys, look at the beauty
and the grumpy old beast.

04:19.290 --> 04:20.360
Ready, look at the contrast.

04:20.360 --> 04:21.290
Beauty.

04:21.290 --> 04:22.123
Beast.

04:22.123 --> 04:22.956
Beauty.

04:22.956 --> 04:23.789
Beast.

04:28.079 --> 04:30.367
- These guys can't fucking
score to save their life.

04:30.367 --> 04:32.060
- It figures
he's talking about sports.

04:32.060 --> 04:32.910
What else is new?

04:36.310 --> 04:37.570
What you doing?

04:37.570 --> 04:39.720
- I'm just trying to
get some tunes playing.

04:39.720 --> 04:41.490
- You're picking the music now?

04:41.490 --> 04:42.430
- Absolutely.

04:42.430 --> 04:43.880
- Alright, is
that really a good idea?

04:43.880 --> 04:46.950
- Come on, you don't
wanna hear some disco?

04:46.950 --> 04:49.670
- No Brody, no one does.

04:49.670 --> 04:51.090
- Stop.

04:51.090 --> 04:52.550
- Can you actually
like play something

04:52.550 --> 04:55.138
maybe within the last 50 years or?

04:55.138 --> 04:57.190
- What all boy band stuff?

04:57.190 --> 04:58.430
- Alright shut the fuck up.

04:58.430 --> 05:00.150
I'm not a boy band fan.
- Listen.

05:00.150 --> 05:02.900
Just because you have a
boy band looking boyfriend.

05:02.900 --> 05:05.370
- Right, oh my god I forgot.

05:05.370 --> 05:06.210
You're so right.

05:06.210 --> 05:08.683
Look at what a stud we've got here.

05:09.546 --> 05:11.180
Alright, you know what,
you pick your music

05:11.180 --> 05:13.313
just make sure it's decent this time.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.146
Okay.

05:14.146 --> 05:15.552
- You'll like it, you'll like it.

05:15.552 --> 05:17.152
- Alright.

05:23.632 --> 05:26.660
- Baby, is everything okay?

05:26.660 --> 05:27.506
- She's alright.

05:27.506 --> 05:28.339
She's just having a moment.

05:43.090 --> 05:43.923
- Are we ready guys?

05:43.923 --> 05:44.756
Everybody squish in.

05:46.361 --> 05:48.161
Alright and cheers to Hannah, ready.

05:49.080 --> 05:50.120
Happy birthday Hannah.

05:50.120 --> 05:51.397
- Happy birthday Hannah.

05:53.370 --> 05:55.490
- Yeah we need to do that more often.

05:55.490 --> 05:56.323
- Yeah, it's always nice

05:56.323 --> 05:57.600
hanging out with everyone.

05:57.600 --> 05:58.790
I love all of them.

05:58.790 --> 06:01.019
- Yeah we need to do
that like every month.

06:01.019 --> 06:01.960
- Right.

06:01.960 --> 06:02.883
- Or every week.

06:03.834 --> 06:05.610
- I
don't know about that.

06:05.610 --> 06:06.944
- No, I'm down for that.

06:06.944 --> 06:08.785
- We'll be alcoholics.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.960
- Listen, next
time you're driving though.

06:10.960 --> 06:12.350
- I don't think so.

06:12.350 --> 06:14.283
Listen, I needed this tonight okay.

06:15.160 --> 06:17.170
Need to get my mind off, drink a little,

06:17.170 --> 06:18.603
spend some time with friends.

06:19.845 --> 06:22.973
It's better to be happy than
to be just sad, you know.

06:23.842 --> 06:24.675
- I thought you were gonna say

06:24.675 --> 06:27.103
"I need to drive because
I'm the better driver."

06:27.103 --> 06:28.620
- Shut your mouth.

06:28.620 --> 06:29.453
You just want to win.

06:29.453 --> 06:30.453
- You're actually good.
- Thank you.

06:30.453 --> 06:31.863
- You're actually a good driver.

06:33.825 --> 06:37.110
- And um, I wanted
to apologize for earlier.

06:37.110 --> 06:37.943
I'm sorry.

06:39.200 --> 06:40.163
- Sorry for what?

06:41.120 --> 06:43.840
- For my breakdown at the bar.

06:43.840 --> 06:45.740
I started crying and everything.

06:45.740 --> 06:48.010
- Sweetie that wasn't a breakdown.

06:48.010 --> 06:49.710
You were just a little upset.

06:49.710 --> 06:52.480
- I know, but
Brody I do that every year

06:52.480 --> 06:55.000
and I just feel like,
maybe I'm overthinking,

06:55.000 --> 06:57.260
but I don't want our friends to hate us

06:57.260 --> 06:59.260
because I'm the girl that always cries

06:59.260 --> 07:01.120
and breaks down about her little sister.

07:01.120 --> 07:03.680
And I just don't wanna be a burden.

07:03.680 --> 07:06.403
- Oh stop, you're definitely not a burden.

07:07.307 --> 07:08.383
You're definitely not a burden to me.

07:09.540 --> 07:10.590
- Thank you.

07:11.903 --> 07:13.639
I love you.

07:13.639 --> 07:14.583
- I love you sweetie.

07:16.310 --> 07:17.943
- You're always so good to me.

07:19.568 --> 07:20.463
And we are home.

07:22.126 --> 07:23.110
- Home sweet home.

07:26.152 --> 07:27.706
Let's shut some of these lights off.

07:27.706 --> 07:28.973
- Yeah, god I'm so tired.

07:30.916 --> 07:31.749
Locked in!

07:47.534 --> 07:48.434
It's chilly Jesus.

07:50.226 --> 07:51.807
- Well we did get back home.

07:51.807 --> 07:53.387
- I know.

07:53.387 --> 07:55.093
You got the door?

07:55.093 --> 07:56.191
- Yeah I got it.

07:56.191 --> 07:57.858
- No the key, okay.

09:30.538 --> 09:31.710
Did you have fun last night?

09:31.710 --> 09:33.323
- I did, how about you?

09:34.287 --> 09:35.120
- Yeah, I had fun.

09:36.470 --> 09:38.683
It was nice getting to see everyone again.

09:39.912 --> 09:40.767
- It was.

09:40.767 --> 09:41.611
- Hmm-mm.

09:41.611 --> 09:43.207
- I'm just really feeling it today.

09:43.207 --> 09:44.040
- I know.

09:44.040 --> 09:46.110
I'm regretting half the
shots I took last night.

09:47.149 --> 09:48.370
- Oh god, me too.

09:48.370 --> 09:50.370
Well I did all my shots.

09:50.370 --> 09:51.573
Mike said I shouldn't tell ya.

09:53.372 --> 09:55.664
- I have to go running
later, Jesus Christ.

09:55.664 --> 09:57.397
It's gonna hurt like a bitch.

09:57.397 --> 09:59.860
- Yeah, you might wanna
avoid running today.

09:59.860 --> 10:00.693
- You're right.

10:00.693 --> 10:02.680
I'm gonna go later so
I'll be fine by then.

10:04.369 --> 10:05.373
- That's good.

10:05.373 --> 10:06.219
- Hmm-mm.

10:06.219 --> 10:07.149
- What else you gonna do today?

10:07.149 --> 10:07.982
Anything?

10:07.982 --> 10:11.063
- Um, yeah, I'm gonna go to
the dock and visit Hannah.

10:12.400 --> 10:14.673
The usual yearly routine.

10:15.520 --> 10:17.996
And then I'm gonna go to the mall

10:17.996 --> 10:19.920
and I'm gonna meet Maria and
we're just gonna go shopping.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.610
- Okay that should be fun on her birthday.

10:21.610 --> 10:25.149
- Yeah, I figured I'd call her
and see what she was doing.

10:25.149 --> 10:26.422
Just so I could hang out with her

10:26.422 --> 10:28.693
and get my mind off of
things, cheer me up a little.

10:34.595 --> 10:36.435
- I do not wanna go to work today.

10:37.499 --> 10:38.724
I just wanna keep sleeping.

10:38.724 --> 10:39.557
- I know.

10:41.356 --> 10:42.690
At least you slept though.

10:42.690 --> 10:43.890
I couldn't sleep at all.

10:47.640 --> 10:52.640
Did you hear any weird
noises at all last night?

10:52.680 --> 10:53.840
- Noises?

10:53.840 --> 10:55.250
- Yeah.

10:55.250 --> 10:56.083
- No.

10:57.632 --> 10:59.915
Why, what'd you hear?

10:59.915 --> 11:00.748
- I don't know.

11:00.748 --> 11:01.810
It sounded like someone was like

11:01.810 --> 11:03.360
walking up and down the stairs.

11:05.674 --> 11:06.872
- I don't know.

11:06.872 --> 11:07.740
Was it windy out?

11:07.740 --> 11:09.274
- No.

11:09.274 --> 11:11.577
When I heard it at first, it woke me up.

11:11.577 --> 11:13.080
And I thought maybe you'd got out of bed

11:13.080 --> 11:15.235
and you went downstairs
to get a drink of water.

11:15.235 --> 11:17.287
But then I looked over and
you were still sleeping.

11:17.287 --> 11:18.890
- Yeah, yeah, those shots put me out.

11:18.890 --> 11:19.890
I was done.
- Yeah.

11:21.730 --> 11:23.577
It's really weird.

11:23.577 --> 11:25.243
It wasn't like a normal house noise

11:25.243 --> 11:26.523
or pipes or anything like that.

11:27.990 --> 11:30.525
I'm trying to think of
what it could have been.

11:30.525 --> 11:31.633
- You know what it could have been?

11:32.970 --> 11:34.774
Your imagination.

11:34.774 --> 11:35.690
- Yeah.

11:35.690 --> 11:38.471
- Especially with Hannah's
birthday and everything.

11:38.471 --> 11:39.318
- Hmm.

11:39.318 --> 11:40.151
- That's probably what it is.

11:40.151 --> 11:42.144
- Yeah, you're probably right.

11:42.144 --> 11:45.549
- It's just that time of year, so.

11:45.549 --> 11:47.799
- I'm a little high strung.

11:49.732 --> 11:50.782
I just need to relax.

11:53.830 --> 11:54.988
- Oh man.

11:54.988 --> 11:56.096
I can't believe how late it is.

11:56.096 --> 11:58.540
Listen, I've gotta get ready for work.

11:58.540 --> 11:59.373
- Okay.

11:59.373 --> 12:00.206
- Love you sweetie.

12:00.206 --> 12:01.120
- Love you too, have fun.

12:01.120 --> 12:02.458
Be careful.

12:02.458 --> 12:04.458
- Yeah, will do.

12:35.374 --> 12:36.374
- Hi Hannah.

12:40.640 --> 12:43.363
I'm here again, of
course, for your birthday.

12:46.201 --> 12:49.951
But this time, I actually
brought you a gift.

12:52.142 --> 12:53.170
It's Sam.

12:53.170 --> 12:54.193
Your stuffed bunny.

12:55.970 --> 12:57.060
I hope you remember him

12:57.060 --> 12:59.473
'cause you used to take
him around everywhere.

13:00.720 --> 13:02.073
You guys were best friends.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.923
He held up well, look at him.

13:12.067 --> 13:14.480
I know, I'm sure you're
probably sick and tired of me

13:14.480 --> 13:17.893
coming here every year
and pestering you, but,

13:19.800 --> 13:21.633
it really helps give me closure.

13:33.390 --> 13:35.397
Hannah, I just wanna let you know

13:35.397 --> 13:36.910
that not a day goes by
when I don't think about

13:36.910 --> 13:37.950
what happened here.

13:41.946 --> 13:44.163
And that no one is to
blame for it, but me.

13:53.320 --> 13:56.950
I always, I always think
about what could've happened,

13:56.950 --> 13:59.493
or what I could've changed
or done differently.

14:01.950 --> 14:02.783
And I know just,

14:02.783 --> 14:04.953
that if I could go back,

14:06.340 --> 14:08.253
I would've been braver for you.

14:09.990 --> 14:11.670
And I wouldn't have froze.

14:11.670 --> 14:13.718
I would've gotten help,

14:13.718 --> 14:15.263
or I would've helped you or something.

14:16.930 --> 14:18.293
Or even if it was me.

14:20.700 --> 14:22.273
But you were so little.

14:27.560 --> 14:29.380
I miss you more and more.

14:54.820 --> 14:55.763
I love you.

14:59.330 --> 15:00.933
I love you so much.

15:04.297 --> 15:07.080
And even if you don't forgive me,

15:10.830 --> 15:11.678
I want you to know that

15:11.678 --> 15:13.523
you're always gonna be my little sister.

15:15.601 --> 15:17.003
And nothing's gonna change that.

15:28.430 --> 15:30.067
Happy birthday Hannah.

15:59.138 --> 15:59.985
Maria.

15:59.985 --> 16:00.985
Hi.
- Oh, hi.

16:02.042 --> 16:03.181
- How are you?

16:03.181 --> 16:04.758
- I'm good.

16:04.758 --> 16:08.565
I know it's nice to
see you, let's go shop.

16:08.565 --> 16:09.850
- Here we are, Eleganza.

16:11.505 --> 16:12.755
I'm so excited.

16:14.502 --> 16:16.073
- Look at this color.
- Oh my god,

16:16.073 --> 16:18.140
that looks so good on you.

16:18.140 --> 16:19.483
Yes, do a twirl for me.

16:20.789 --> 16:21.647
Do it.

16:21.647 --> 16:22.995
Do a twirl, yes.

16:22.995 --> 16:24.650
You look amazing.

16:24.650 --> 16:25.483
- Thank you.

16:25.483 --> 16:26.316
- Get it.

16:27.870 --> 16:30.750
- Wow, look at you so beautiful.

16:30.750 --> 16:33.103
- Thank you, do you like it really?

16:33.103 --> 16:34.160
- I love it, I wish I--

16:34.160 --> 16:35.810
- I love the sleeves.
- It fits so good.

16:35.810 --> 16:37.480
- Oh my god,

16:37.480 --> 16:39.955
you can see why you can't
take me clothing shopping,

16:39.955 --> 16:41.253
'cause I'm gonna wanna buy everything.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.193
Okay, it's your turn.

16:46.200 --> 16:47.747
Yes.
- I love the dress.

16:47.747 --> 16:49.070
- I love it on you.

16:49.070 --> 16:50.508
- Little black dress.
- I know.

16:50.508 --> 16:51.782
- So far so good.
- Look at like

16:51.782 --> 16:53.142
all the studs and everything.

16:53.142 --> 16:54.740
That's so pretty.

16:54.740 --> 16:56.292
Buy it.
- Gonna get it.

16:56.292 --> 16:58.006
- I know, we're gonna
buy the whole store today.

16:58.006 --> 16:58.839
- Whole store.

17:01.650 --> 17:03.020
Wow, so beautiful.

17:03.020 --> 17:04.089
Starfish print.

17:04.089 --> 17:05.093
- I know right.

17:05.941 --> 17:06.773
I like it.

17:06.773 --> 17:09.454
Very aquatic on me, that's my thing.

17:09.454 --> 17:10.413
- Perfect for summer.

17:10.413 --> 17:11.246
- I know yeah, like the beach.

17:11.246 --> 17:12.970
Like overthrow it on
the beach or something.

17:13.864 --> 17:14.696
I like it.

17:14.696 --> 17:16.230
Okay, another one to add on the list.

17:16.230 --> 17:18.130
My bills gonna be pretty, pretty high.

17:20.536 --> 17:21.601
- This dress fits so good.

17:21.601 --> 17:22.520
- I know, I was just gonna say.

17:22.520 --> 17:24.180
Oh my god.
- I look so hot.

17:24.180 --> 17:25.300
- It looks so good.

17:25.300 --> 17:27.883
It shows like, oh my
god, your figure so well.

17:28.940 --> 17:30.525
That is amazing.
- Gonna get it.

17:30.525 --> 17:31.358
- A print.

17:31.358 --> 17:32.790
Yeah, you need to get it.

17:32.790 --> 17:35.884
Obviously, I'm gonna tell you
you should buy everything.

17:39.121 --> 17:40.209
- This dress is killing.

17:40.209 --> 17:41.976
- It's so soft.

17:41.976 --> 17:43.953
- So beautiful.
- Oh my gosh, I love it.

17:45.554 --> 17:46.980
Do you think my boyfriend will kill me

17:46.980 --> 17:49.447
if I buy like three dresses today?

17:49.447 --> 17:50.560
- He, he would love you.

17:50.560 --> 17:52.640
- Yeah honestly, I think it's worth it.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.340
Okay, good, gonna buy another one.

18:09.578 --> 18:11.000
Okay.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.763
I just finished my five miles.

18:13.610 --> 18:16.380
So, today being Hannah's birthday

18:16.380 --> 18:19.790
I went shopping, I went
to the dock earlier.

18:19.790 --> 18:22.210
So, I just wanted to clear
my head up a little bit.

18:22.210 --> 18:24.853
You know, go for a run,
get some fresh air.

18:25.985 --> 18:26.970
Okay, sorry.

18:26.970 --> 18:28.340
I'm out of breath.

18:28.340 --> 18:30.610
Okay, so now, I'm gonna go home.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.850
I'm gonna shower because as you can tell

18:32.850 --> 18:34.530
I'm a sticky mess.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.760
So, I'm gonna go ahead and do that

18:36.760 --> 18:39.090
and then I will keep you guys updated.

20:43.932 --> 20:44.765
Hello.

20:48.350 --> 20:49.183
Yeah.

20:52.560 --> 20:53.603
I'm okay mom.

20:57.720 --> 21:01.993
Yeah, I, I went to the dock
earlier and I visited her.

21:03.925 --> 21:05.083
Just what I do every year.

21:08.810 --> 21:10.483
Yeah, I decided to leave Sam.

21:14.660 --> 21:15.493
Hmm-mm.

21:19.946 --> 21:20.779
Okay.

21:23.299 --> 21:25.990
I know, I know I'm okay.

22:41.677 --> 22:42.675
Brody.

22:42.675 --> 22:43.637
Brody, wake up.

22:43.637 --> 22:44.470
- What?
- Please wake up,

22:44.470 --> 22:46.300
please wake up.

22:46.300 --> 22:47.412
- What is it?

22:47.412 --> 22:48.630
- I swear to god, I
just heard a little girl

22:48.630 --> 22:49.733
outside our door.

22:50.810 --> 22:51.643
- What?

22:51.643 --> 22:53.802
- Please just go up and check and then,

22:53.802 --> 22:55.730
and then if nothing's there
I'll go back to sleep.

22:55.730 --> 22:58.350
- It's nothing, go back to sleep.

22:58.350 --> 22:59.653
- You don't believe me.

23:00.982 --> 23:01.996
- You're just having a bad dream.

23:01.996 --> 23:02.883
Go back to sleep, I'm tired.

23:03.873 --> 23:05.540
- You're incredible.

23:28.160 --> 23:30.190
Can I ask you a question?

23:30.190 --> 23:31.090
- Yeah, what's up?

23:32.180 --> 23:35.210
- Do you think I'm
making up this whole act

23:35.210 --> 23:38.530
that I've been talking about
with you for the last few days?

23:38.530 --> 23:41.100
The whole giggling, the running
up the stairs and things.

23:41.100 --> 23:43.700
Because every time it happens
I'm the only who hears it

23:43.700 --> 23:46.380
and you refuse to get out
of bed and check it for me,

23:46.380 --> 23:48.200
because you're too tired.

23:48.200 --> 23:50.623
- Sweetie, I'm not hearing anything.

23:51.480 --> 23:54.389
Obviously I would go and check
it out if I heard something.

23:54.389 --> 23:56.070
- No, I think you'd be too lazy honestly,

23:56.070 --> 23:57.974
even if you did hear something.

23:57.974 --> 23:58.984
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

23:58.984 --> 24:00.481
- No, I'd absolutely check on it.

24:00.481 --> 24:02.343
It's your imagination like I told you.

24:03.940 --> 24:05.010
- No, I just.

24:05.010 --> 24:10.010
Ooh, it's weird how you just
keep blaming me for this,

24:10.070 --> 24:12.130
when you're not even the one
who's gonna take initiative

24:12.130 --> 24:14.070
and be a man and actually
look down the stairs

24:14.070 --> 24:15.823
and see what's going on.

24:15.823 --> 24:16.760
- No one's blaming anybody.

24:16.760 --> 24:17.980
I didn't hear it.

24:17.980 --> 24:18.870
I didn't get up.

24:18.870 --> 24:19.810
- You don't trust me though.

24:19.810 --> 24:22.160
You think that I would
lie and make this up.

24:22.160 --> 24:23.600
- I'm not saying you're lying.

24:23.600 --> 24:26.580
Maybe you heard something,
but it's your imagination.

24:26.580 --> 24:28.008
Think about it.

24:28.008 --> 24:29.941
- If you say that one
more time, I swear to god.

24:29.941 --> 24:32.317
- It's nighttime.
- All I'm asking is.

24:32.317 --> 24:33.203
- You're gonna hear everything.

24:34.530 --> 24:35.970
- Brody, it sounded like

24:35.970 --> 24:38.490
someone was shuffling
up and down the stairs

24:38.490 --> 24:40.360
and I heard a giggle.

24:40.360 --> 24:43.589
Unless there's a random
child in our house,

24:43.589 --> 24:45.270
I don't know what's going on,

24:45.270 --> 24:47.310
but with it all falling
around Hannah's birthday

24:47.310 --> 24:48.810
something weird is happening

24:48.810 --> 24:51.440
and I would appreciate it if
my boyfriend would listen to me

24:51.440 --> 24:53.583
and actually believe me for once.

24:55.570 --> 24:57.519
- I don't know what to tell you.

24:57.519 --> 24:58.422
- You don't know what to tell me,

24:58.422 --> 25:00.101
that's because you're
too busy on your phone.

25:00.101 --> 25:01.340
Listen.
- Jesus, what is your problem?

25:01.340 --> 25:02.930
- Don't Jesus me.

25:02.930 --> 25:05.150
I really need you to listen.

25:05.150 --> 25:08.587
- I am listening, I'm telling
you I didn't hear anything.

25:08.587 --> 25:09.880
What do you want me to do?

25:09.880 --> 25:11.932
Say I did hear something?
- Yes.

25:11.932 --> 25:12.998
- I didn't hear.

25:12.998 --> 25:14.464
Okay, I heard something then, how's that?

25:14.464 --> 25:15.297
- Because I feel like
you're lying about it.

25:15.297 --> 25:17.004
I feel like you've heard it

25:17.004 --> 25:18.200
and you just don't wanna believe me.

25:18.200 --> 25:19.100
- You really believe that?

25:19.100 --> 25:20.910
- Yes I do.

25:20.910 --> 25:22.520
Because there is no way in hell

25:22.520 --> 25:24.820
that you hear laughing and shuffling

25:24.820 --> 25:27.486
and you would not be able to hear it all.

25:27.486 --> 25:28.319
- Listen.
- It was loud.

25:28.319 --> 25:30.020
- Obviously if I heard
that I would be scared

25:30.020 --> 25:32.255
and get up and check it out.

25:32.255 --> 25:33.730
- I, I don't know, I don't
know what to do anymore.

25:33.730 --> 25:35.597
I'm so sick and tired
of this being all on me

25:35.597 --> 25:37.250
and it all being my fault.

25:37.250 --> 25:38.330
And me being the crazy one.

25:38.330 --> 25:39.667
- No one's saying it's your fault.

25:39.667 --> 25:40.500
- And it's all in my head.

25:40.500 --> 25:42.140
- I'm just saying it's a bad time of year.

25:42.140 --> 25:42.973
- Hmm.

25:44.710 --> 25:46.786
It's different if it's one day.

25:46.786 --> 25:48.660
This has been happening for a few nights

25:48.660 --> 25:50.600
and I just, I don't know what to do.

25:50.600 --> 25:52.130
I can't even talk to you about it

25:52.130 --> 25:54.240
and I just, I don't know where to go.

25:54.240 --> 25:55.150
I don't know where to turn,

25:55.150 --> 25:56.550
I don't know who to talk to.

25:58.840 --> 26:00.753
- I'm here if you need me.

26:00.753 --> 26:02.170
- Hmm-mm, thanks.

26:08.920 --> 26:12.260
Brody and I, don't fight that much.

26:12.260 --> 26:15.330
And if we do it's over
something small and stupid

26:15.330 --> 26:18.640
and it gets resolved the
day after and we're fine.

26:18.640 --> 26:21.570
But then something big and serious happens

26:21.570 --> 26:22.990
and I try to tell him about it

26:22.990 --> 26:24.920
and I try to explain to him

26:24.920 --> 26:26.470
what I think is going on

26:26.470 --> 26:27.680
and I'm crazy.

26:27.680 --> 26:28.900
And he doesn't wanna listen.

26:28.900 --> 26:31.350
And it's my imagination,
and it's all in my head.

26:35.110 --> 26:38.193
I'm, I'm running out
of ideas on what to do.

26:39.110 --> 26:42.380
I can't really talk to
family or friends about this.

26:42.380 --> 26:47.310
I, I don't think anyone would
believe me if I told them

26:47.310 --> 26:50.650
and of course my
boyfriend, who I live with,

26:50.650 --> 26:52.260
doesn't believe me.

26:52.260 --> 26:53.850
So that's good.

26:53.850 --> 26:55.460
That's always nice.

26:55.460 --> 26:56.970
I don't understand.

26:56.970 --> 26:58.760
I'm sick of being called crazy.

26:58.760 --> 27:01.820
I'm sick of being called a psycho

27:01.820 --> 27:04.020
for believing that all of this stuff

27:04.020 --> 27:06.067
that's happening together is some part--

27:22.093 --> 27:25.043
I know that that door was shut
when I started filming this.

27:29.490 --> 27:31.840
I don't even want to go
out and look right now.

27:37.750 --> 27:39.373
This is what I'm talking about.

27:41.830 --> 27:44.780
I don't even feel safe
in my own house anymore.

27:44.780 --> 27:47.143
And no one, no one fucking believes me.

27:51.580 --> 27:54.453
I'm gonna go try and
figure out what that was.

27:55.870 --> 28:00.870
And I'll keep you guys updated.

29:31.174 --> 29:32.674
- Hannah, stop it!

29:52.506 --> 29:53.339
- Jesus.

29:53.339 --> 29:54.440
Honey what's wrong?

29:54.440 --> 29:56.177
- When did you get home?

29:56.177 --> 29:57.010
- I just walked in a second ago.

29:57.010 --> 29:57.843
Are you okay?

29:57.843 --> 29:58.950
- No.

29:58.950 --> 30:00.680
All of these chairs here moved,

30:00.680 --> 30:02.376
completely by themselves.

30:02.376 --> 30:03.209
- What?

30:03.209 --> 30:05.010
- I was just sitting
here and they just moved.

30:05.010 --> 30:06.790
I know it's Hannah, I know it's her

30:06.790 --> 30:09.330
and I screamed and all of them just moved,

30:09.330 --> 30:10.640
completely by themselves.

30:10.640 --> 30:12.360
I'm not making this up Brody,

30:12.360 --> 30:13.390
I'm not making this up.

30:13.390 --> 30:15.260
I'm not crazy, it's Hannah.

30:15.260 --> 30:18.633
And, please just go check the tapes.

30:19.649 --> 30:20.581
- Okay.
- That way you'll see

30:20.581 --> 30:21.414
that I'm not making this up.
- Okay, okay, okay.

30:21.414 --> 30:22.358
- Please just go check the tapes.

30:22.358 --> 30:24.401
- Okay, I'll check the tapes.

30:27.927 --> 30:32.129
- Oh my god.

30:41.561 --> 30:43.553
- Honey, I just got
done reviewing the tape.

30:44.615 --> 30:45.461
- Well?

30:45.461 --> 30:47.200
- Well I see you sitting
there reading a book.

30:47.200 --> 30:49.273
And then it just goes fuzzy.

30:51.620 --> 30:53.780
- What do you mean it goes fuzzy?

30:53.780 --> 30:56.440
- It goes fuzzy, I saw nothing.

30:56.440 --> 30:58.340
- The last thing you saw was me sitting?

30:58.340 --> 31:01.274
What, what happened when I stood
up and I went to the table?

31:01.274 --> 31:02.107
- It doesn't have that.

31:02.107 --> 31:04.330
It just has you, just
sitting there reading a book.

31:04.330 --> 31:06.580
- So it completely cut
out right when I got up?

31:06.580 --> 31:07.960
When I was still sitting on the couch?

31:07.960 --> 31:09.220
Right before I got up it stopped.

31:09.220 --> 31:10.760
- It just has you sitting their reading.

31:10.760 --> 31:12.540
After that it's just all fuzz.

31:14.440 --> 31:17.980
- Don't you understand that
something doesn't want us to see

31:17.980 --> 31:19.390
what I'm seeing.
- Come on.

31:19.390 --> 31:20.910
- It doesn't want you to
believe me or something.

31:20.910 --> 31:23.320
Brody I'm not crazy,
I'm not making this up.

31:23.320 --> 31:24.230
It happened.

31:24.230 --> 31:26.051
You don't think that
it's a weird coincidence

31:26.051 --> 31:28.820
that it cut out right before
I'm saying that this happened?

31:28.820 --> 31:31.150
- Honey, do you hear yourself right now?

31:31.150 --> 31:33.640
It's a technical problem,
it happens all the time.

31:33.640 --> 31:36.082
- There's nothing wrong with that camera.

31:36.082 --> 31:37.300
- It's a crap system!
- Why would it just cut out?

31:37.300 --> 31:38.925
Right then, when I need you to see it?

31:38.925 --> 31:39.928
- I don't know.

31:39.928 --> 31:41.620
Like I said it's a crap system.

31:41.620 --> 31:43.620
- Unbelievable, it is not a crap system.

31:43.620 --> 31:45.920
It's not a bad, it's a good camera

31:45.920 --> 31:48.068
and it would not just crap out like that.

31:48.068 --> 31:50.100
- Well.
- Especially when I'm saying.

31:50.100 --> 31:51.650
Right when something weird happened.

31:51.650 --> 31:52.540
- Well it did.
- So you don't--

31:52.540 --> 31:54.315
- Do you wanna go watch it?

31:54.315 --> 31:55.148
What do you want me to tell you?

31:55.148 --> 31:56.530
I saw something after it?

31:56.530 --> 31:58.773
It all got fuzzy, you can't see shit.

32:00.890 --> 32:02.223
- So you don't believe me?

32:03.423 --> 32:05.276
I'm not crazy Brody,
I'm not making this up.

32:05.276 --> 32:07.840
This is happening and you can't believe me

32:07.840 --> 32:09.420
because you're not seeing anything.

32:09.420 --> 32:12.070
- I mean, where's the proof?

32:12.070 --> 32:13.623
I mean, really?

32:17.254 --> 32:19.130
I mean, I don't mean to
say it like that but,

32:19.130 --> 32:22.057
I'm not--
- Get out, get out.

32:23.110 --> 32:24.210
- Now I'm the bad guy.

32:26.226 --> 32:27.309
Unbelievable.

33:52.770 --> 33:53.603
- Brody, Brody.

33:53.603 --> 33:54.660
Brody I need you.
- What?

33:54.660 --> 33:56.117
- Wake up right now.
- What?

33:57.660 --> 33:59.090
- I heard the laugh,

33:59.090 --> 34:00.480
you need to get up and check it out.

34:00.480 --> 34:02.530
Please, please wake up.
- Stop it.

34:02.530 --> 34:05.175
- Wake up please.
- Let me sleep.

34:05.175 --> 34:06.008
Jesus.

34:07.621 --> 34:08.978
- Brody please, I'm begging you.

34:08.978 --> 34:10.181
- You're just hearing something.

34:10.181 --> 34:12.150
- I'm not hearing anything,
you need to get up.

34:12.150 --> 34:13.409
Get up please, now.

34:13.409 --> 34:15.463
- Alright, Jesus.

34:24.985 --> 34:25.818
- Go.

34:32.085 --> 34:32.931
- Turn on the light.

34:32.931 --> 34:36.099
- I know, I'm trying, trying.

34:37.060 --> 34:37.893
It's not upstairs.

34:37.893 --> 34:40.321
Whatever it came from, it was downstairs.

34:40.321 --> 34:41.154
- I'm gonna check anyway.

34:44.186 --> 34:45.239
- Nothings up here.

34:45.239 --> 34:47.498
Please go down the stairs and check.

34:47.498 --> 34:48.960
Go first.

34:48.960 --> 34:49.862
Please be careful.

34:57.830 --> 34:59.773
What the fuck was that?

35:01.239 --> 35:03.422
- I don't know, stay close.

35:03.422 --> 35:04.502
- I'm here.
- Stay close.

35:04.502 --> 35:06.222
- I'm right here.

35:11.123 --> 35:13.350
We just have to go, we just have to go.

35:13.350 --> 35:14.233
We can't stay upstairs.

35:15.843 --> 35:18.161
Check, check that room first.

35:18.161 --> 35:19.140
Check in there.

35:19.140 --> 35:20.473
- Alright, keep it down.

35:20.473 --> 35:22.309
- Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

35:25.412 --> 35:26.995
- Turn on the light.
- I can't see anything.

35:26.995 --> 35:28.548
- Turn on the light.

35:30.116 --> 35:33.410
- I am turning
it on, it's not working.

35:33.410 --> 35:35.286
- Shit, this one's out.

35:35.286 --> 35:36.424
- What the fuck?

35:36.424 --> 35:37.829
What the fuck?

35:37.829 --> 35:38.915
What the fuck?

35:38.915 --> 35:39.748
- Let's go this way.

35:39.748 --> 35:41.360
- Okay.

35:41.360 --> 35:42.933
Try to see if that one works.

35:43.835 --> 35:44.668
Is the door locked?

35:44.668 --> 35:45.501
- The doors locked.

35:47.370 --> 35:48.621
- That one works.

35:48.621 --> 35:50.270
What the hell?

35:50.270 --> 35:51.930
Why would that one be off.

35:51.930 --> 35:53.923
- What the fuck?

35:53.923 --> 35:55.608
Watch out, I just stepped in something.

35:55.608 --> 35:56.464
It was wet.

35:56.464 --> 35:57.797
- What?

36:00.068 --> 36:00.901
Brody.

36:02.357 --> 36:04.420
Brody.

36:04.420 --> 36:06.153
Brody, that's a human footprint.

36:10.707 --> 36:11.970
Oh my god.

36:11.970 --> 36:13.370
Brody.

36:13.370 --> 36:14.901
- What is it?

36:14.901 --> 36:16.600
- It's footprints.

36:16.600 --> 36:18.194
- Stop yelling.

36:18.194 --> 36:19.378
- Hannah drowned,

36:19.378 --> 36:20.930
why else would there be a
trail of fucking footprints

36:20.930 --> 36:22.113
in the kitchen?

36:23.027 --> 36:25.232
- Let me check the back door.

36:25.232 --> 36:27.813
- Okay, okay.

36:27.813 --> 36:29.984
Everything was locked when we went to bed.

36:29.984 --> 36:30.984
It's locked.

36:35.671 --> 36:37.985
Oh my god.

36:37.985 --> 36:39.079
- Yeah, I dunno.

36:39.079 --> 36:40.863
All the doors are locked,
the windows are locked.

36:42.250 --> 36:43.770
Everything's secure.

36:43.770 --> 36:45.660
- Do you have
any other explanation

36:45.660 --> 36:47.640
for this but Hannah?

36:47.640 --> 36:48.810
It makes sense.

36:48.810 --> 36:50.868
- What are you talking about?

36:50.868 --> 36:53.785
- It's fucking water footprints,

36:53.785 --> 36:55.544
what else would cause that?

36:55.544 --> 36:56.377
What do you think that noise was?

36:56.377 --> 36:58.500
You don't think that those two
things are linked together?

36:58.500 --> 37:01.180
The footprints and whatever
that fucking noise was?

37:01.180 --> 37:02.750
- No, there's a leak obviously.

37:02.750 --> 37:04.940
- You're ridiculous,
you are fucking ridiculous.

37:04.940 --> 37:05.900
- How am I ridiculous?

37:05.900 --> 37:07.533
It's a couple of fucking
puddles of water on the floor.

37:07.533 --> 37:10.100
- It's not puddles,
it's in the shape of,

37:10.100 --> 37:12.326
if you open your fucking eyes!

37:12.326 --> 37:14.310
- I am, I'm looking at it right now.

37:14.310 --> 37:15.143
Look puddle!

37:15.143 --> 37:16.040
Puddle!

37:16.040 --> 37:17.380
Puddle!

37:17.380 --> 37:19.599
Where do you see footprint?

37:21.258 --> 37:22.493
What the fuck is wrong with you?

37:25.230 --> 37:26.063
Footprints?

37:27.570 --> 37:28.570
It's a fucking leak.

37:32.357 --> 37:34.259
- Oh god.

37:38.680 --> 37:40.770
I can't believe you don't believe me.

37:40.770 --> 37:43.070
- Listen honey,
I'm sorry for yelling.

37:44.070 --> 37:44.993
Alright.

37:46.290 --> 37:48.040
We'll fix this tomorrow.

37:48.040 --> 37:49.372
- Tomorrow?

37:49.372 --> 37:51.193
You're gonna sleep knowing
that that happened?

37:52.353 --> 37:55.863
- Honey, it's a
leak, I'll fix it tomorrow.

37:57.361 --> 37:59.790
Okay, I'm very confident it's a leak.

37:59.790 --> 38:00.830
Okay.

38:00.830 --> 38:02.989
If you believe it's footprints

38:02.989 --> 38:04.923
then I don't know what to tell you.

38:06.250 --> 38:08.100
- You're fucking ridiculous.

38:09.260 --> 38:10.610
- I'm going to bed.

38:12.190 --> 38:13.894
- Thanks for the help.

38:17.204 --> 38:18.787
I know it's Hannah.

38:21.442 --> 38:22.609
That's Hannah.

38:31.070 --> 38:33.000
I would just really like to know

38:34.000 --> 38:36.830
how someone can fall asleep at night

38:36.830 --> 38:41.830
after hearing a noise that
loud in their own kitchen.

38:42.900 --> 38:46.100
Going to sleep any pretending
that none of it ever happened,

38:46.100 --> 38:49.189
even though your girlfriend
physically got on video

38:49.189 --> 38:54.189
footprints, water footprints,
all over the kitchen.

38:54.750 --> 38:57.040
Little child footprint.

38:57.040 --> 38:59.840
What more of an explanation does he need?

38:59.840 --> 39:01.120
I don't know.

39:01.120 --> 39:02.993
I do not know and,

39:05.320 --> 39:07.923
I don't know what I have
to do to convince him.

39:11.590 --> 39:14.450
How do you sleep after hearing that?

39:21.926 --> 39:24.930
It just doesn't make sense.

39:24.930 --> 39:28.380
I don't know if he's doing
this on purpose to piss,

39:28.380 --> 39:29.733
I don't, I don't know.

39:36.132 --> 39:37.549
I am so stressed.

39:38.810 --> 39:43.242
And during shitty times
like these, someone,

39:43.242 --> 39:46.440
if, if they're going
through something like this,

39:46.440 --> 39:49.053
your significant other's
supposed to help you.

39:49.984 --> 39:51.540
And supposed to be there and support you

39:51.540 --> 39:54.090
and try to figure out
what the fuck is going on.

39:54.090 --> 39:56.460
And he's not, he's brushing everything,

39:56.460 --> 39:58.570
everything under the rug.

39:58.570 --> 40:01.440
And just saying that I'm crazy

40:01.440 --> 40:02.800
and I'm making all of this up.

40:02.800 --> 40:04.770
I did not fucking walk downstairs

40:04.770 --> 40:06.790
and make those footprints by myself.

40:06.790 --> 40:09.380
I walked downstairs and they were there.

40:09.380 --> 40:12.950
They were there and I got
it physically on film.

40:12.950 --> 40:14.270
And if he doesn't believe that

40:14.270 --> 40:16.250
that's in the shape of
a little girls foot,

40:16.250 --> 40:18.833
I don't know what the fuck to do anymore.

40:29.450 --> 40:31.053
Maybe it would be different if,

40:32.790 --> 40:34.020
if he's been all,

40:34.020 --> 40:36.370
through all this shit
that I've been through

40:36.370 --> 40:39.400
and if he watched his
little fucking sister die.

40:39.400 --> 40:41.743
Die right in front of
him, when he was a kid.

40:45.300 --> 40:47.593
Then maybe he'd believe what was going on.

40:50.620 --> 40:53.173
But my patience is really
wearing thin with him.

40:58.780 --> 41:00.380
I don't know what to do anymore.

41:03.643 --> 41:04.476
I don't know.

41:05.813 --> 41:06.646
I need help.

42:49.172 --> 42:50.961
- What the fuck?

42:50.961 --> 42:52.547
- I know you heard it that time.

42:52.547 --> 42:53.391
- What was that?

42:53.391 --> 42:55.058
- That was a scream.

42:56.606 --> 42:58.315
We need to check this out.

42:58.315 --> 42:59.732
Is this on, okay.

43:01.844 --> 43:04.011
Come on, come on, come on.

43:07.151 --> 43:09.355
Brody will you stand in front of me.

43:09.355 --> 43:10.522
Get the light.

43:14.177 --> 43:16.983
Whatever that noise was, was
from, was from downstairs.

43:17.817 --> 43:19.589
- I know it came right below us right?

43:19.589 --> 43:20.839
- Yes.

43:21.770 --> 43:23.796
- I think it
came from the kitchen.

43:23.796 --> 43:24.642
- I don't know,

43:24.642 --> 43:25.803
just check the other room to be safe.

43:34.027 --> 43:35.944
I need the light again.

43:38.700 --> 43:39.589
- Holy shit.

43:39.589 --> 43:40.460
- What the fuck?

43:40.460 --> 43:41.873
Oh my god.

43:41.873 --> 43:42.983
- There's someone
in the fucking house.

43:42.983 --> 43:44.779
- Oh my god, it's Hannah.

43:44.779 --> 43:46.826
It's, it's Hannah.

44:03.265 --> 44:05.182
Check that back window.

44:12.624 --> 44:13.519
Is it locked?

44:13.519 --> 44:14.373
- It's locked.

44:14.373 --> 44:15.243
- It's locked?

44:15.243 --> 44:17.660
How the fuck did that
thing roll by itself?

44:17.660 --> 44:18.493
Oh my god.

44:21.385 --> 44:22.552
What the fuck?

44:24.596 --> 44:26.096
Don't do it again.

44:28.287 --> 44:29.983
Check behind the couch.

44:34.814 --> 44:35.950
- Nothing, did you check the back door?

44:35.950 --> 44:36.783
- No.

44:46.172 --> 44:48.217
It's locked.
- It's locked.

44:49.923 --> 44:51.557
- How the fuck
do you think that thing

44:51.557 --> 44:53.143
rolled by itself?

44:54.070 --> 44:55.020
Brody, it's Hannah.

44:56.220 --> 44:58.108
- You make no fucking sense.

45:03.205 --> 45:06.282
- Just one more room,
we have to check that room.

45:14.676 --> 45:15.509
- I can't see shit.

45:15.509 --> 45:16.342
- I can't see anything.

45:24.369 --> 45:26.786
- Rach, what's wrong?

45:27.875 --> 45:31.770
- Brody, that
is the stuffed animal

45:31.770 --> 45:34.583
I left on the dock for Hannah's birthday.

45:36.330 --> 45:37.163
- Are you sure?

45:37.163 --> 45:38.343
- Yes, I'm fucking sure.

45:39.660 --> 45:40.970
It's Sam.

45:40.970 --> 45:43.850
It's her stuffed animal that
we had when she was little.

45:43.850 --> 45:46.440
And it was with her when she drowned.

45:46.440 --> 45:48.750
And, I know that's it.

45:48.750 --> 45:50.820
And I have a video of me leaving it behind

45:50.820 --> 45:53.630
when I left the fucking
dock on her birthday.

45:53.630 --> 45:54.463
I'm not crazy and making this up.

45:54.463 --> 45:55.393
I have proof.

45:56.253 --> 45:57.107
- Are you 100% sure?

45:57.107 --> 45:58.180
- Yes I'm 100% fucking sure.

45:58.180 --> 45:59.223
I know what that is.

46:00.480 --> 46:01.838
Oh my god.

46:03.300 --> 46:04.213
Don't touch it!

46:10.494 --> 46:12.110
It's wet.

46:12.110 --> 46:13.548
It's wet.

46:13.548 --> 46:14.408
- What?

46:14.408 --> 46:15.241
- It's wet from when drowned.

46:15.241 --> 46:16.670
Just like the footsteps last night.

46:16.670 --> 46:17.850
It, it all makes sense.

46:17.850 --> 46:18.880
It's linking together.

46:18.880 --> 46:21.670
Hannah drowned, that was
her footprints last night

46:21.670 --> 46:22.890
and now this is hers,

46:22.890 --> 46:24.050
and she's, she's in here.

46:24.050 --> 46:26.920
She's in the fucking house.

46:26.920 --> 46:28.497
Oh my god.

46:32.220 --> 46:33.320
- It's fucking soaked.

46:34.500 --> 46:35.750
- What do we do?

46:37.660 --> 46:40.127
I'm not sleeping with
that thing in the house.

46:41.090 --> 46:42.423
You have to get it out.

46:43.540 --> 46:45.160
- I'll take it outside.

46:45.160 --> 46:47.810
- I want that thing
burned tomorrow morning.

46:51.287 --> 46:53.241
- Come on, I'll throw it out back.

47:13.762 --> 47:16.126
Get the fuck out of here.

47:21.981 --> 47:23.398
Honey, it's okay.

47:54.700 --> 47:56.400
Baby I wanna help.

47:56.400 --> 47:59.190
I can't stand seeing you like this.

47:59.190 --> 48:00.023
What can I do?

48:01.540 --> 48:02.893
- It's Hannah, Brody.

48:05.940 --> 48:06.793
It's Hannah.

48:09.040 --> 48:10.440
- Why do you think it's her?

48:11.990 --> 48:14.830
- All this started
happening on her birthday.

48:14.830 --> 48:17.430
I don't know what other
convincing you need to hear.

48:21.876 --> 48:25.713
- Okay, look, let's say it is Hannah.

48:26.760 --> 48:28.200
She's your sister.

48:28.200 --> 48:30.700
Why would she be doing
something like this to you?

48:32.420 --> 48:35.750
- Because I watched her drown.

48:35.750 --> 48:36.993
When we were children.

48:38.550 --> 48:42.303
I'm the one that let my sister
die right in front of me.

48:43.200 --> 48:45.160
I could've called out or,

48:45.160 --> 48:47.741
or tried to help her or something,

48:47.741 --> 48:49.191
but I just watched it happen.

48:50.130 --> 48:55.130
I froze and my sister
is dead because of me.

48:56.320 --> 49:00.307
Brody don't you understand
that I'm a murderer.

49:00.307 --> 49:01.140
- Don't say that.

49:01.140 --> 49:04.950
- I killed my little sister
and now she wants vengeance,

49:04.950 --> 49:09.010
and she's trying to, to do
something to make me see

49:09.010 --> 49:10.940
that I'm reason she's dead.

49:10.940 --> 49:12.390
I let this all happen.

49:12.390 --> 49:14.730
I didn't do anything to help her.

49:14.730 --> 49:18.220
Every year we go out and I
celebrate my sisters death

49:18.220 --> 49:20.480
and try to make it feel
better about myself.

49:20.480 --> 49:22.853
And I try to have closure but,

49:24.040 --> 49:26.950
I don't understand how I've never realized

49:26.950 --> 49:29.040
that this is all my fault.

49:29.040 --> 49:30.900
- It's not your fault.

49:30.900 --> 49:32.573
Honey, it's not your fault.

49:33.960 --> 49:34.793
Okay.

49:36.200 --> 49:38.183
Don't say that, don't think that.

49:40.755 --> 49:41.700
We gotta figure something out.

49:41.700 --> 49:42.933
The both of us.

49:46.573 --> 49:48.656
- I should've helped her.

49:51.195 --> 49:52.095
- It's okay honey.

49:53.250 --> 49:54.350
We'll figure this out.

49:55.437 --> 49:56.483
- I don't know what to do.

49:58.460 --> 49:59.860
- Do you wanna get a priest?

50:00.830 --> 50:02.920
Do you think maybe
getting a priest over here

50:02.920 --> 50:05.024
to bless the house will help?

50:05.024 --> 50:06.530
- I don't know.

50:06.530 --> 50:09.050
We have to start somewhere.

50:09.050 --> 50:10.767
- I think that's a good start.

50:12.877 --> 50:14.490
- But will that help?

50:14.490 --> 50:15.323
What do they do?

50:15.323 --> 50:17.730
I don't, I don't understand
what a priest does.

50:17.730 --> 50:20.761
She's my little sister,
I don't wanna hurt her.

50:20.761 --> 50:21.640
I just want this to all stop.

50:21.640 --> 50:23.103
- She won't get hurt.

50:24.400 --> 50:26.030
She won't get hurt honey.

50:26.030 --> 50:28.912
The priest will come
over, bless the house.

50:28.912 --> 50:31.550
Get rid of any type of spirits,

50:31.550 --> 50:36.550
or any type of evil that's going on here.

50:38.574 --> 50:41.519
- I don't know, I guess
we could look into it.

50:41.519 --> 50:43.994
- Yeah, lets definitely look into that.

50:43.994 --> 50:44.827
Okay.

50:45.975 --> 50:47.963
That'll be our first step, let's do that.

50:50.271 --> 50:51.250
- I'm sorry Brody.

50:51.250 --> 50:52.400
- Don't be sorry honey.

50:54.320 --> 50:55.153
Don't be sorry.

51:12.260 --> 51:15.683
I hate leaving you, but
I gotta get to work.

51:17.210 --> 51:19.600
You gonna be okay by yourself tonight?

51:19.600 --> 51:20.930
- Hmm-mm.

51:20.930 --> 51:23.480
- Listen, I promise you,
I'm gonna get that priest.

51:26.780 --> 51:27.613
- I'm gonna be okay.

51:28.489 --> 51:30.010
- Alright good.

51:30.010 --> 51:31.360
Alright, listen I love you.

51:32.265 --> 51:33.845
- I love you too.

51:33.845 --> 51:36.045
- And if you need
anything just let me know.

51:36.890 --> 51:38.353
Give me a call, anytime.

51:39.418 --> 51:40.251
- Hmm-mm.

51:49.880 --> 51:54.690
So, tonight is my first night home alone

51:56.340 --> 51:58.090
since everything started happening.

51:58.930 --> 52:00.363
Brody had to go to work,

52:02.130 --> 52:05.833
so tonight I'm just
gonna have to be brave.

52:21.547 --> 52:22.380
Hannah.

52:25.570 --> 52:26.773
I know you're listening.

52:32.220 --> 52:33.763
It's just me and you tonight.

52:39.900 --> 52:44.900
So, I just wanted to, to ask if tonight.

52:54.450 --> 52:59.450
Don't do anything that's gonna bother me,

53:01.710 --> 53:02.543
or scare me.

53:05.740 --> 53:07.241
Where's the light?

53:07.241 --> 53:08.741
Where's the light?

53:13.430 --> 53:15.313
Or anything that's gonna
harm me in any way.

53:26.270 --> 53:27.770
And I just wanna let you know

53:31.367 --> 53:32.700
that you're my little sister

53:35.060 --> 53:36.943
and even though you're mad at me,

53:39.090 --> 53:41.413
and even though you're trying to scare me.

53:50.301 --> 53:54.014
I want you to know that I love you.

54:18.028 --> 54:19.445
Nothing in here.

54:19.445 --> 54:20.754
Okay.

54:20.754 --> 54:21.587
Okay.

54:22.771 --> 54:23.745
I'm okay.

54:23.745 --> 54:24.578
Okay.

54:26.599 --> 54:27.432
I'm okay.

54:29.462 --> 54:30.295
I'm okay.

54:32.017 --> 54:33.267
I'm okay, okay.

54:49.457 --> 54:50.714
I'm okay.

54:50.714 --> 54:51.547
I'm okay.

54:53.842 --> 54:58.220
I'm gonna be okay.

54:58.220 --> 55:00.173
I'm gonna be okay tonight.

55:02.980 --> 55:04.330
Everything's gonna be okay.

55:12.930 --> 55:17.930
Hannah, I feel like tonight,

55:18.330 --> 55:21.193
after apologizing and talking to you,

55:22.640 --> 55:24.313
I think you finally get it.

55:25.490 --> 55:27.740
That I'm so sorry

55:28.970 --> 55:31.363
and everything was an accident.

55:32.900 --> 55:35.483
And I know that you really
didn't mean to scare me,

55:37.064 --> 55:38.890
'cause let me tell you,

55:38.890 --> 55:40.390
you scared the shit out of me.

55:43.040 --> 55:45.940
But I'm confident that tonight
everything's gonna be fine.

55:47.810 --> 55:49.193
And I know you love me.

55:50.639 --> 55:52.883
You know we cleared the air and,

55:54.730 --> 55:57.760
I just know that
everything's gonna be okay.

55:57.760 --> 55:59.470
I know Brody's gonna be home

56:00.430 --> 56:04.100
and tonight I just have
to make it through,

56:04.100 --> 56:06.273
but I'm not worried anymore.

56:07.710 --> 56:09.040
I'm not worried because

56:10.870 --> 56:12.820
I know that you're my little sister

56:12.820 --> 56:14.820
and you wouldn't do anything to hurt me.

56:16.240 --> 56:19.969
You were just angry and I get it, I do.

56:19.969 --> 56:20.802
I get it.

56:24.520 --> 56:27.610
Everything's gonna go
completely back to normal.

56:27.610 --> 56:28.510
Everything's fine.

56:33.130 --> 56:37.623
And I also wanted to let
you know, that I love you.

56:40.530 --> 56:41.753
I love you so much.

56:44.850 --> 56:45.773
I really do.

56:53.300 --> 56:55.200
I'm just gonna try and get some sleep.

58:07.909 --> 58:08.753
What the?

58:23.780 --> 58:24.613
Hannah.

58:27.376 --> 58:28.293
Ha, Hannah?

58:33.571 --> 58:34.821
Oh god, oh god.

58:48.957 --> 58:51.597
Oh god, oh god, oh god.

59:03.492 --> 59:05.557
Okay, it's fine.

59:05.557 --> 59:09.224
You're okay, its okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

59:10.846 --> 59:12.485
It's not real.

59:31.851 --> 59:34.556
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

59:43.962 --> 59:46.518
Oh god, oh god, oh god.

59:46.518 --> 59:47.601
Oh my god.

59:52.076 --> 59:52.909
Hannah.

59:54.323 --> 59:55.156
I'm sorry.

01:00:14.552 --> 01:00:15.385
Hello.

01:00:16.899 --> 01:00:17.732
Hannah.

01:00:18.713 --> 01:00:19.913
Hannah.

01:02:12.792 --> 01:02:13.625
- Hey Rach.

01:02:13.625 --> 01:02:15.653
Rach, I'm home sweetie.

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:18.633
Is everything okay?

01:02:21.153 --> 01:02:22.750
I checked my phone all
day, you never called.

01:02:22.750 --> 01:02:24.360
Anything happen?

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:25.193
- No.

01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:27.670
- Nothing happened?

01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:29.400
- No, nothing.

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:31.150
- Alright, so everything's alright.

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:34.850
Alright, you go back to bed.

01:02:34.850 --> 01:02:37.690
I'm gonna go downstairs
and get some ice cream.

01:02:37.690 --> 01:02:38.952
Do you want any?

01:02:38.952 --> 01:02:39.793
I can bring you back some.

01:02:40.828 --> 01:02:42.138
- No thanks.

01:02:42.138 --> 01:02:44.600
- Alright go back to sleep sweetie.

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.757
I'll turn the light off for you.

01:03:06.236 --> 01:03:07.069
Hey babe.

01:03:10.543 --> 01:03:12.363
Listen, I know you've been upset.

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:15.507
Do you still want that
priest to come over?

01:03:18.753 --> 01:03:19.586
- No.

01:03:20.599 --> 01:03:21.583
- What do you mean no?

01:03:24.890 --> 01:03:25.803
- No, means no.

01:03:27.550 --> 01:03:30.430
- The priest can come over,
he can investigate stuff.

01:03:30.430 --> 01:03:32.033
He can solve what's going on.

01:03:33.416 --> 01:03:35.150
- What did I just say?

01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:36.650
- That doesn't make any sense.

01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:39.900
It's so easy, he'll come
over, he'll watch the house.

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:42.358
- You didn't even think
any of this happening

01:03:42.358 --> 01:03:43.191
when I first mentioned it,

01:03:43.191 --> 01:03:45.650
so why are you so concerned now?

01:03:45.650 --> 01:03:47.040
- Well, that's what I'm saying.

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:48.863
He can come over and check it out.

01:03:51.070 --> 01:03:52.969
There's no harm in it.

01:03:52.969 --> 01:03:54.300
He can only help us.

01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:55.790
Especially with what's been going on.

01:03:55.790 --> 01:03:57.300
- I said no.

01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:58.910
No is the final answer.

01:03:58.910 --> 01:04:00.803
I'm done talking about this.

01:04:02.605 --> 01:04:04.055
- I just, I don't understand.

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:07.145
- Okay.

01:04:07.145 --> 01:04:07.978
- It's just so simple.

01:04:09.010 --> 01:04:11.760
He can come over, he'll be
here for what, half an hour?

01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:14.703
- I don't want a priest in this house.

01:04:16.035 --> 01:04:17.560
- What do you mean you don't
want a priest in this house?

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:18.393
- I said no.

01:04:19.610 --> 01:04:21.283
Just leave it be, okay.

01:04:22.450 --> 01:04:23.820
- It's not a problem.

01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:25.270
- Stop arguing with me.

01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:27.915
- I'm not arguing with
you, I'm just saying,

01:04:27.915 --> 01:04:30.665
it just makes sense that he
can come over, investigate.

01:04:31.513 --> 01:04:34.012
- You're nauseating.

01:04:34.012 --> 01:04:35.998
- How is it nauseating,
I'm trying to talk to you.

01:04:35.998 --> 01:04:37.332
- I'm just talking to you

01:04:37.332 --> 01:04:38.220
and if I say no, then that means no.

01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:40.790
I don't know why you keep
bringing up the topic.

01:04:40.790 --> 01:04:42.690
- What?
- I said no Brody.

01:04:42.690 --> 01:04:43.523
Leave it be.

01:04:44.484 --> 01:04:45.783
- What do you mean leave it be?

01:04:46.742 --> 01:04:47.575
It's so simple.

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.700
He'll come over and bless the house.

01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:52.037
How can that hurt?

01:04:54.985 --> 01:04:56.240
- Are you done?

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:57.363
- No are you done?

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:01.990
Will you care if Pat comes over?

01:05:01.990 --> 01:05:03.890
- I really don't give a shit.

01:05:20.577 --> 01:05:23.244
- Say, what's up with that porn light?

01:05:23.244 --> 01:05:24.077
- What?

01:05:24.077 --> 01:05:24.910
- That outside light.

01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:29.003
- Oh, yeah, I know.

01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:32.950
Look it was the only light I could find.

01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:35.270
Rachel was giving me shit about that too.

01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:37.320
- Yeah, I would too, it's a little weird.

01:05:40.990 --> 01:05:42.807
Where's she at anyway?

01:05:42.807 --> 01:05:44.720
- Ah, she went to bed early.

01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:46.796
She's been having trouble sleeping lately.

01:05:46.796 --> 01:05:48.633
- Oh, what is she sick or something?

01:05:50.130 --> 01:05:51.293
- Yeah, sort of.

01:05:53.460 --> 01:05:56.057
- Well what's she coming down with?

01:05:57.433 --> 01:06:00.483
- Alright, I mean, it's
kind of something else.

01:06:01.410 --> 01:06:02.690
It's no big deal.

01:06:02.690 --> 01:06:05.490
I don't, I don't wanna talk about it.

01:06:05.490 --> 01:06:06.490
It's really nothing.

01:06:07.718 --> 01:06:08.710
- It's alright.

01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:10.088
What's the big secret?

01:06:10.088 --> 01:06:10.921
You can tell me.

01:06:10.921 --> 01:06:12.370
- Yeah, I mean it's not a secret.

01:06:12.370 --> 01:06:15.993
It's just, something I don't
think you'd really understand.

01:06:17.477 --> 01:06:19.144
- Dude it's alright.

01:06:27.450 --> 01:06:28.443
- Alright look.

01:06:35.610 --> 01:06:38.480
What I'm about to tell you,
you can't tell anybody.

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:39.530
Do you understand me?

01:06:40.554 --> 01:06:43.170
- I swear it, yeah, I won't tell anybody.

01:06:43.170 --> 01:06:46.320
- I've been kind of wanting
to get this off my chest but,

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:48.500
this is something strictly
between me and you.

01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:50.610
This cannot leave the room.

01:06:50.610 --> 01:06:52.703
- Sure dude, it's fine.

01:06:54.630 --> 01:06:56.050
- Alright.

01:06:56.050 --> 01:06:57.749
Do you remember when we all got together

01:06:57.749 --> 01:06:59.600
and went out that night
for Hannah's party?

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:01.430
- Yeah it was fun.

01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:03.110
- Yeah well.

01:07:03.110 --> 01:07:04.640
Ever since then,

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:07.730
really strange things have been
happening around this house.

01:07:07.730 --> 01:07:10.691
- Strange like uh, like what?

01:07:10.691 --> 01:07:14.690
- Well, I mean at first I
didn't really believe it.

01:07:14.690 --> 01:07:16.510
But, Rachel would tell me

01:07:16.510 --> 01:07:18.253
that she'd get woken up late at night

01:07:18.253 --> 01:07:20.863
with like really loud bangs.

01:07:20.863 --> 01:07:23.330
Then during the day when she's by herself

01:07:23.330 --> 01:07:28.030
she said she would hear
like creepy noises.

01:07:28.030 --> 01:07:29.850
Then she even went as far as saying

01:07:29.850 --> 01:07:33.853
she saw something move
by itself for no reason.

01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:36.240
- Oh.

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:38.750
- I thought it was her imagination,

01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:41.530
or maybe she's hallucinating.

01:07:41.530 --> 01:07:42.798
- Yeah.

01:07:42.798 --> 01:07:43.631
- I mean, she's barely had any sleep.

01:07:43.631 --> 01:07:46.910
I mean, what other possible
reasons were there?

01:07:46.910 --> 01:07:50.420
But then I started to have
some of these experiences.

01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:51.460
- You're having 'em too?

01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:52.830
- Yeah.

01:07:52.830 --> 01:07:55.760
And every time I check
the cameras, there's,

01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:56.963
nothing shows up.

01:07:58.580 --> 01:07:59.981
- But they're working fine?

01:07:59.981 --> 01:08:00.835
They're not working?

01:08:00.835 --> 01:08:01.668
- I know they're working,

01:08:01.668 --> 01:08:04.050
it's just when I review
it there's either like

01:08:04.050 --> 01:08:08.270
sections missing or, you
know, the screen goes fuzzy.

01:08:08.270 --> 01:08:10.150
You can't see shit.

01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:12.080
It's pretty much useless.

01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:12.967
- That's insane.

01:08:14.030 --> 01:08:15.409
- Yeah.

01:08:15.409 --> 01:08:18.590
And now, Rachel's been
really acting strangely.

01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:19.939
We talked about, you know,

01:08:19.939 --> 01:08:22.319
having a priest come over to the house.

01:08:22.319 --> 01:08:23.729
You know to bless it,

01:08:23.729 --> 01:08:25.986
if there's any evil spirits,

01:08:25.986 --> 01:08:27.603
you know, it would help
get rid of 'em right?

01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:30.840
- You going that far with it?

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:33.689
- Yeah, this is, this is
where I'm at at this point.

01:08:33.689 --> 01:08:34.523
This is.

01:08:36.359 --> 01:08:37.550
I'm serious dude.

01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:39.069
- Wow.

01:08:39.069 --> 01:08:41.077
- So, at first she goes

01:08:41.077 --> 01:08:43.117
"ah, this is great idea", you know.

01:08:43.117 --> 01:08:45.520
"This is something that will work."

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:46.930
You know, she was excited about it.

01:08:46.930 --> 01:08:49.680
Now all of sudden she does a 180.

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:51.819
She doesn't want the
priest to come over at all.

01:08:51.819 --> 01:08:53.700
In fact you can't even
mention the word priest

01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:54.814
in front of her.

01:08:54.814 --> 01:08:56.098
She doesn't want this priest

01:08:56.098 --> 01:08:57.698
to even step foot in this house.

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:01.109
- Well, something like this,
you gotta do something.

01:09:01.109 --> 01:09:02.712
- Yeah, I know.

01:09:05.099 --> 01:09:06.830
And then something really scary happened.

01:09:06.830 --> 01:09:07.662
- Really?

01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:15.160
- Fuck, I got the chills just
even thinking about this.

01:09:20.170 --> 01:09:24.020
Rachel said she left a stuffed
animal down at the docks

01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:25.800
for Hannah's birthday.

01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:27.000
- Okay.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.210
- Well, that same stuffed animal showed up

01:09:30.210 --> 01:09:34.933
in the middle of night, soaking
wet on my fucking couch.

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:37.029
- You're kidding me?

01:09:37.029 --> 01:09:38.500
- No dude, I'm serious.

01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:41.090
The next morning, I went
to bury it out back.

01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:42.479
I said "fuck this, I'm burning it."

01:09:42.479 --> 01:09:43.640
I set it on fire,

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:45.229
apparently if you set it on fire,

01:09:45.229 --> 01:09:46.939
it gets rid of the evil spirits.

01:09:46.939 --> 01:09:48.510
So, I wasn't fucking around.

01:09:48.510 --> 01:09:49.673
It's burnt to a crisp.

01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:53.313
- That's insane.

01:09:53.313 --> 01:09:54.841
- Yeah I know.

01:09:54.841 --> 01:09:56.091
- That's crazy.

01:09:56.990 --> 01:09:59.513
Well, well fuck that.

01:10:02.650 --> 01:10:04.656
- Dude what you doing?

01:10:04.656 --> 01:10:06.620
- I gotta, I gotta check it out.

01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:07.760
- Dude you're kidding me?

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:10.236
- I was yeah, dude with a story like that.

01:10:10.236 --> 01:10:11.069
I've gotta--
- No, no.

01:10:11.069 --> 01:10:11.902
- I've gotta check it out.

01:10:11.902 --> 01:10:13.070
- No, absolutely not.

01:10:13.070 --> 01:10:15.150
Sit the fuck down, drink the beer.

01:10:15.150 --> 01:10:16.620
Just relax.

01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:17.560
- Dude you need like a friend,

01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:19.910
you need a third party just
to see what's going on.

01:10:19.910 --> 01:10:21.007
- No I don't.

01:10:21.007 --> 01:10:22.980
- I'll try and capture
something on my phone.

01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:23.900
- Listen.

01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:26.390
You're making me regret
what I just told you.

01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:28.000
- Dude, I've gotta check.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:28.833
I've gotta.

01:10:28.833 --> 01:10:30.650
Give me a shot, let me try.

01:10:30.650 --> 01:10:32.680
- Listen, I'll tell you
what's gonna happen.

01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:33.990
You're gonna end up waking her up.

01:10:33.990 --> 01:10:35.460
She's gonna flip the fuck out,

01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:37.110
you're not gonna be allowed over.

01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:39.173
I'm telling you.

01:10:39.173 --> 01:10:40.100
- Dude, I got it.

01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:42.720
This is an insane story,
I gotta check this out.

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:43.983
Let me at least try.

01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:46.390
- Dude, you don't stop do you?

01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:49.080
- No, no, no, not with a story like this.

01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:51.283
Let me try and find something.

01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:56.159
- Fine.

01:10:56.159 --> 01:11:00.020
Look, just do it quick and be extra quiet.

01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:01.820
- Dude, I'll be really quiet.

01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:03.590
Just, I got to.

01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:05.273
- Alright, make it quick.

01:11:06.452 --> 01:11:07.285
Go.

01:11:15.345 --> 01:11:16.178
Fuck.

01:11:31.196 --> 01:11:32.946
- Hello, hello.

01:11:35.018 --> 01:11:35.851
Any ghost?

01:11:39.266 --> 01:11:40.511
- Stop please.

01:11:40.511 --> 01:11:42.287
- What's going on?

01:11:42.287 --> 01:11:44.135
- Please stop.

01:11:45.794 --> 01:11:48.706
Please, you're hurting me.

01:11:48.706 --> 01:11:51.789
You're hurting everyone, please stop.

01:11:52.645 --> 01:11:53.659
Please stop.

01:11:53.659 --> 01:11:54.492
Stop Hannah.

01:11:54.492 --> 01:11:55.417
- Hey Rach.

01:11:55.417 --> 01:11:56.250
- Stop please.

01:11:56.250 --> 01:11:57.260
- You okay?

01:11:57.260 --> 01:11:59.916
- Please stop, I'm sorry

01:11:59.916 --> 01:12:01.749
I'm sorry.
- You okay?

01:12:02.939 --> 01:12:05.789
- Please, you're hurting us.
- Hey, hey, hey, it's fine.

01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:08.010
Rach, you're okay.

01:12:08.010 --> 01:12:08.843
Hey.

01:12:08.843 --> 01:12:10.270
Hey, you're okay.

01:12:10.270 --> 01:12:11.800
Hey you're fine.

01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:14.021
Hey, you're okay.

01:12:14.021 --> 01:12:14.873
Hey.

01:12:15.706 --> 01:12:16.539
Oh my god.

01:12:21.417 --> 01:12:22.750
What?

01:12:25.962 --> 01:12:27.138
- Hey what's going on Pat?

01:12:27.138 --> 01:12:27.971
- I'm out of here.

01:12:27.971 --> 01:12:28.804
- You serious?

01:12:28.804 --> 01:12:30.137
What's going on?

01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:40.590
Rach, Rach, is everything okay?

01:12:40.590 --> 01:12:41.423
Rach?

01:12:50.886 --> 01:12:53.154
Rach wake up, wake up.

01:12:53.154 --> 01:12:53.987
Rach.

01:12:53.987 --> 01:12:55.170
Rach is everything okay?

01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:56.973
Rach, wake up.

01:12:58.048 --> 01:12:58.881
- What?

01:12:58.881 --> 01:12:59.880
- I heard all the screaming.

01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:02.140
Pat just ran out of the
house, what happened?

01:13:02.140 --> 01:13:04.110
- What screaming?

01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:05.780
- I was downstairs, I
heard a really loud yell

01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:07.420
and then Pat ran out of the house.

01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:08.320
What happened?

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:10.920
- Brody I've been asleep
for the last three hours.

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:13.029
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:13:13.029 --> 01:13:13.862
- What are you talking about?

01:13:13.862 --> 01:13:15.794
- I've been asleep, why did you wake me?

01:13:15.794 --> 01:13:16.627
- Because I--
- As you know,

01:13:16.627 --> 01:13:17.460
I haven't been able to sleep.

01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:18.640
- I heard somebody yell.

01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:19.473
- I didn't yell.

01:13:19.473 --> 01:13:20.306
Are you making this up now?

01:13:20.306 --> 01:13:22.151
- Well why did Pat run out of the house?

01:13:22.151 --> 01:13:22.984
- I don't know why Pat
ran out of the house,

01:13:22.984 --> 01:13:24.680
I'm trying to get some sleep.
- Jesus Christ.

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:26.286
I'm trying to check on you.
- Get the fuck out.

01:13:26.286 --> 01:13:27.532
- I'm trying to check on you.

01:13:27.532 --> 01:13:29.176
- I don't give a fuck, let me sleep.

01:13:29.176 --> 01:13:31.237
- Jesus Christ, what the
hell is your problem?

01:13:31.237 --> 01:13:33.546
I'm trying to check on you
and that's how you act?

01:13:33.546 --> 01:13:34.379
- Get out.

01:13:35.257 --> 01:13:36.174
- Whatever.

01:14:01.722 --> 01:14:02.555
There you are.

01:14:04.630 --> 01:14:06.170
Listen, I don't know what to do anymore.

01:14:06.170 --> 01:14:07.903
I'm going fucking insane.

01:14:09.877 --> 01:14:12.184
I wanted the priest to come over,

01:14:12.184 --> 01:14:14.184
you didn't want the priest to come over.

01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:16.010
I'm just confused,

01:14:16.010 --> 01:14:18.210
why didn't you want the
priest to come over?

01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:21.423
Hello?

01:14:22.830 --> 01:14:24.603
Okay, now you don't wanna talk.

01:14:25.930 --> 01:14:27.873
Okay, well that makes a lot of sense.

01:14:29.710 --> 01:14:32.360
I guess we're not gonna get
any solutions now are we?

01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:36.110
Keep standing there, not talking.

01:14:36.110 --> 01:14:37.910
That's really gonna help the matter.

01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:42.233
This is ridiculous.

01:14:42.233 --> 01:14:43.268
I don't get it.

01:14:43.268 --> 01:14:45.263
Can you tell me why didn't
want the priest to come over?

01:14:46.750 --> 01:14:50.010
Do you have any other solutions maybe?

01:14:50.010 --> 01:14:50.843
Anything?

01:14:53.395 --> 01:14:55.195
Can you at least fucking say a word?

01:14:57.320 --> 01:14:58.723
What is wrong with you?

01:15:00.430 --> 01:15:04.143
Jesus Christ, what the
fuck is going on with you?

01:15:07.953 --> 01:15:09.460
I'm trying to fix this,

01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:11.560
you're obviously not.

01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:13.450
Go ahead, just fucking quit then.

01:15:13.450 --> 01:15:14.283
Go quit!

01:15:17.544 --> 01:15:20.440
This is, this is unbelievable.

01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:21.550
Shut me off.

01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:23.350
Go ahead, shut me off.

01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:25.350
That's really gonna fucking work isn't it?

01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:26.723
Shut me off.

01:15:27.970 --> 01:15:29.963
That makes no fucking sense.

01:15:32.647 --> 01:15:33.730
Unbelievable.

01:18:44.621 --> 01:18:45.776
Who's that?

01:18:46.305 --> 01:18:52.888
