[theme music]

00:59.393 --> 01:02.663
Dad, who's this?

01:02.763 --> 01:04.132
That really
handsome guy there?

01:04.232 --> 01:05.032
That's me.

01:10.838 --> 01:13.574
No, really.

01:13.674 --> 01:14.808
'Fraid so, pal.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.510
That was taken the day your
mom and me get married.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.379
You look young.

01:18.479 --> 01:20.414
Well, we got married when
we were about your age.

01:23.451 --> 01:25.386
Dad, you said the
basketball game was one.

01:25.486 --> 01:26.287
It is.

01:26.387 --> 01:28.456
This is the pre-game show.

01:28.556 --> 01:30.591
My god, you got
the pre-game show,

01:30.691 --> 01:33.427
the post-game show, the halftime
show, and highlights at 11:00.

01:33.527 --> 01:35.095
You don't even need the game.

01:35.196 --> 01:37.831
Man cannot live
by highlights alone.

01:37.931 --> 01:38.732
[rock music playing]

01:38.832 --> 01:39.633
Becky!

01:39.733 --> 01:41.034
[rock music playing]

01:41.135 --> 01:43.337
Baby, will go up there and
tell her to turn that down?

01:43.437 --> 01:44.238
What's the matter?

01:44.338 --> 01:45.306
Are your legs busted?

01:45.406 --> 01:49.143
Actually, it's just
a hairline fracture.

01:49.243 --> 01:52.713
I'll be sitting for
most of the game.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.315
Becky!

01:54.415 --> 01:56.284
Rock 'n' roll!

01:56.384 --> 01:57.818
That does it.

01:57.918 --> 01:58.752
Connor's up.

01:58.852 --> 02:00.120
He's movin' across
the side line.

02:00.221 --> 02:01.189
He breaks into a run.

02:01.289 --> 02:02.390
He stops--

02:02.490 --> 02:04.091
And he loses the ball to
lightening-fast Roseanne

02:04.192 --> 02:05.058
that comes out of nowhere.

02:05.159 --> 02:07.495
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

02:07.595 --> 02:09.463
I'm dead.

02:09.563 --> 02:13.834
[laughs] And she's dead.

02:13.934 --> 02:16.136
Well, the best care
for death's a hot meal,

02:16.237 --> 02:17.705
I always say, and
I don't know why.

02:17.805 --> 02:20.908
But anyway, your
dinner's in the oven.

02:21.008 --> 02:21.942
Thanks.

02:22.042 --> 02:25.279
Boy, this job is grueling.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.215
Hey, you're the one
that wanted to strike

02:27.315 --> 02:28.582
it rich in the newspaper game.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.518
[rock music playing]

02:30.618 --> 02:31.552
Becky!

02:31.652 --> 02:32.453
God.

02:32.553 --> 02:33.421
[phone ringing]

02:33.521 --> 02:35.356
I got it!

02:35.456 --> 02:36.324
What is it?

02:36.424 --> 02:38.259
Would you please
turn that down?

02:38.359 --> 02:39.827
I'm trying to watch a game.

02:39.927 --> 02:42.430
I'm trying to learn biology.

02:42.530 --> 02:45.299
Well, all you need
to know about biology

02:45.399 --> 02:47.268
is that the head bone's
connected to the neck bone,

02:47.368 --> 02:49.637
and the neck bone's gonna be
broken unless you get up there

02:49.737 --> 02:50.604
and turn that down.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.108
Who was it?

02:55.209 --> 02:57.445
Oh, it was Mrs. Clyde.

02:57.545 --> 03:00.748
She claims she never
got her newspaper.

03:00.848 --> 03:03.851
Well, that's the second time
she's claimed that this week,

03:03.951 --> 03:04.885
Darlene.

03:04.985 --> 03:06.220
You better get over
there right away.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.120
I can't.

03:07.221 --> 03:08.289
I'm all out.

03:08.389 --> 03:11.925
Well, here, take this
one of me and dad's.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.461
I ain't done with that yet.

03:13.561 --> 03:15.963
Well, your daughter's
in career crisis here.

03:16.063 --> 03:18.232
Hop to it.

03:18.332 --> 03:20.468
I need some time off.

03:20.568 --> 03:21.769
Ho, ho, ho.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.437
You need some time off.

03:23.537 --> 03:24.538
I need a vacation.

03:24.638 --> 03:25.873
You need a vacation?

03:25.973 --> 03:28.609
I haven't had one day off
since the day I married you.

03:28.709 --> 03:29.910
Sure you have.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.111
Oh, I have not.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.446
What about our honeymoon?

03:32.546 --> 03:33.847
What honeymoon?

03:33.947 --> 03:38.719
18 hours on your cousin's house
boat does not a honeymoon make.

03:38.819 --> 03:44.224
I happen to recall that that
was a veritable love fest.

03:44.325 --> 03:45.393
Ah, come on.

03:45.493 --> 03:47.227
We never had a real
honeymoon and you know it.

03:47.328 --> 03:49.663
It's the one missing
piece in an otherwise

03:49.763 --> 03:51.665
picture perfect romance.

03:51.765 --> 03:53.467
Rosanne.
ROSEANNE: What?

03:53.567 --> 03:55.168
Are you saying that
you want a honeymoon?

03:55.269 --> 04:00.040
No, I'm saying I want to
be tarred and feathered.

04:00.140 --> 04:01.475
Come on, babe.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.110
We got two jobs and three kids.

04:03.210 --> 04:04.445
We ain't got the time.

04:04.545 --> 04:06.113
Well, we could make time.

04:06.213 --> 04:09.249
I bet you each of us could
get a week off next month.

04:09.350 --> 04:11.419
You're really serious
about this, ain't you?

04:11.519 --> 04:15.289
No, I just brought it up
to complicate your life.

04:15.389 --> 04:18.492
All right, nothing
complicated about that.

04:18.592 --> 04:19.827
We'll go on a honeymoon.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.395
When are we gonna go?

04:21.495 --> 04:23.364
[sighs] Well,
I'll call my cousin,

04:23.464 --> 04:26.199
see if his houseboat's free.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.836
I wanna go someplace romantic!

04:28.936 --> 04:30.804
Whoa, are you saying I
can't pick something romantic?

04:30.904 --> 04:33.507
Yeah, you are not
romantic at all.

04:33.607 --> 04:36.043
- I am a hopeless romantic.
- Well, you're hopeless.

04:38.712 --> 04:39.880
I am the king of romance.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.482
Well, that's because you
learned it from the queen.

04:41.582 --> 04:43.083
DAN: Oh yeah?

04:43.183 --> 04:44.318
Yeah.

04:44.418 --> 04:46.219
Are you saying that you're
more romantic than I am?

04:46.320 --> 04:48.422
I most soitenly am.

04:48.522 --> 04:49.823
All right, your
Royal Highness.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.392
I'll tell you what.

04:51.492 --> 04:52.593
You pick on honeymoon spot.

04:52.693 --> 04:53.794
I'll pick a honeymoon spot.

04:53.894 --> 04:55.729
And then we'll see which
one is the most romantic.

04:55.829 --> 04:58.231
You're on, beef boy.

04:58.332 --> 04:59.367
Hey, Rosie.

04:59.467 --> 05:01.535
What if we both wind up
picking the same thing.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.537
It'll mean we're actually
meant for each other.

05:03.637 --> 05:04.472
No, it won't mean that.

05:13.213 --> 05:16.083
You know what'd be my
idea of a perfect honeymoon?

05:16.183 --> 05:19.319
Mel Gibson and
a stick of butter.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.221
[laughs]

05:22.723 --> 05:24.492
I'm serious!

05:24.592 --> 05:26.427
No, it'd be a--

05:26.527 --> 05:30.364
it be an entire month on a Greek
island in a quaint little house

05:30.464 --> 05:34.034
set up in the mountains, but
not too far away from the beach.

05:34.134 --> 05:36.770
Oh, that sounds really good.

05:36.870 --> 05:39.039
The only thing that's
missing is your husband.

05:39.139 --> 05:42.042
That's why it's the
perfect honeymoon.

05:42.142 --> 05:44.678
[laughs] I get it!

05:44.778 --> 05:46.714
Hey, Darlene, you're late.

05:46.814 --> 05:48.649
I know, I got
hung up at school.

05:48.749 --> 05:50.217
Well, two people
already's been calling

05:50.317 --> 05:51.919
looking for their newspapers.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.153
Damn!

05:53.253 --> 05:55.623
Well, there's no need
to cuss for hell's sake.

05:55.723 --> 05:56.957
Bring it out.

05:57.057 --> 05:58.726
I'll help you fold 'em up.

05:58.826 --> 05:59.993
Thanks.

06:00.093 --> 06:01.895
Here's I'll fold the rest.
- All right.

06:01.995 --> 06:04.765
Here, sis, make
yourself useful, huh?

06:04.865 --> 06:07.300
So, you're gonna
watch our kids when me

06:07.401 --> 06:09.236
and Dan goes on our honeymoon?

06:09.336 --> 06:11.238
Sure, but you're
not gonna anywhere.

06:11.338 --> 06:13.273
So now you're reading
the future, right?

06:13.373 --> 06:14.842
Now you've got ESP.

06:14.942 --> 06:16.944
No, it's just that every
time you and Dan plan a trip,

06:17.044 --> 06:19.747
something happens.
And you know why that is?

06:19.847 --> 06:21.381
Oh, enlighten me, Swami Nanda.

06:24.317 --> 06:27.421
Because you don't
really want to go.

06:27.521 --> 06:30.190
Because you think that nobody
can survive without you.

06:30.290 --> 06:31.492
Well, they can't.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.594
Because you think you're
the center of the universe.

06:33.694 --> 06:35.496
Well, things do
revolve around me.

06:38.298 --> 06:39.433
Hi, AJ.

06:39.533 --> 06:40.333
Hi, kiddo.

06:40.434 --> 06:41.702
Hey, how was school?

06:41.802 --> 06:43.270
All right, except for biology.

06:43.370 --> 06:46.006
Mr. Hodge is making us
dissect a frog in lab.

06:46.106 --> 06:48.175
Oh, I remember when
we had to do that.

06:48.275 --> 06:49.510
Yeah, me too.

06:49.610 --> 06:51.211
I'm in class with this big guy.

06:51.311 --> 06:52.680
He's on the football
team and everything.

06:52.780 --> 06:54.582
I cut into my frog.

06:54.682 --> 06:56.584
He goes down like
a ton of bricks,

06:56.684 --> 06:59.286
you know, cold fainth,
cuts up his shin.

06:59.386 --> 07:00.988
Really?

07:01.088 --> 07:02.355
Ask your dad to
show you his scar.

07:06.159 --> 07:07.327
Well, you guys
may have done it,

07:07.427 --> 07:09.229
but I think it's
morally wrong to hack

07:09.329 --> 07:10.397
up poor, defenseless animals.

07:10.498 --> 07:12.232
Well, the frogs are
already dead by the time

07:12.332 --> 07:13.767
you're hacking on it, ain't it?

07:13.867 --> 07:15.302
Yeah, but if I didn't
have to dissect it,

07:15.402 --> 07:16.737
they wouldn't have to kill it.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.839
If you want to
do it, don't do it.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.207
Yeah, but then I'll
flunk lab and bring

07:20.307 --> 07:22.109
my A average down to a C.

07:22.209 --> 07:24.778
Well, now, Becky, if you feel
that strongly about something,

07:24.878 --> 07:26.547
you shouldn't do it.

07:26.647 --> 07:28.215
You won't get
mad if I get a C?

07:28.315 --> 07:29.817
The only time I'd
ever get mad at you

07:29.917 --> 07:33.186
is if you're doing something
that you know is not right.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.087
Thanks.

07:34.187 --> 07:35.222
[phone ringing]

07:35.322 --> 07:36.590
I got it.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.859
If that's one of my customers,
tell them I'm already gone.

07:38.959 --> 07:39.760
[phone ringing]

07:39.860 --> 07:41.128
Hello?

07:41.228 --> 07:42.530
Oh, hi, Mrs. Clyde.

07:42.630 --> 07:44.898
Oh, no, she probably already
called my boss and complained!

07:44.998 --> 07:46.934
Your paper should
be there any minute.

07:47.034 --> 07:47.835
OK, bye.

07:47.935 --> 07:49.102
Darlene, you better move.

07:49.202 --> 07:50.303
She sounded angry.

07:50.403 --> 07:51.204
I'm moving!

07:51.304 --> 07:53.073
I'm moving!

07:53.173 --> 07:54.975
Becky, go wash
up for dinner now.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.877
Oh what're we having?

07:56.977 --> 07:59.412
Frog legs.

07:59.513 --> 08:03.016
You're so demented.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.351
Hey, baby, I'm home.

08:04.451 --> 08:06.887
Hey, me too!

08:06.987 --> 08:07.788
Hey, Jackie.

08:07.888 --> 08:08.789
Hi.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.457
- Gonna stay for dinner?
- You serious?

08:10.558 --> 08:11.625
We'd love to have you.
ROSEANNE: [laughs]

08:11.725 --> 08:12.660
What's the matter with him?

08:12.760 --> 08:13.927
[laughs]

08:15.195 --> 08:16.930
Can't a guy have a
good day once in a while?

08:17.030 --> 08:20.033
Well, not that good.

08:20.133 --> 08:23.637
What're you smilin'
at, hot stuff?

08:23.737 --> 08:25.673
Well, wait a minute.

08:25.773 --> 08:27.507
What's this in my pocket?

08:27.608 --> 08:28.876
It could be.

08:28.976 --> 08:30.077
It might be.

08:30.177 --> 08:33.480
It is-- holy cow,
it's a honeymoon!

08:33.581 --> 08:35.282
Why, yes, it's paradise.

08:35.382 --> 08:39.620
Another guy who thinks he's
got paradise in his jeans.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.555
ROSEANNE: [laughs]

08:43.591 --> 08:44.992
Yeah, paradise lost.

08:47.895 --> 08:48.762
[laughs]

08:48.862 --> 08:50.931
Yeah.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.833
Cackle, cackle, hens.

08:52.933 --> 08:54.702
[laughter]

08:54.802 --> 08:57.270
Baby, this place
is perfect for us.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.505
It's romantic.

08:58.606 --> 08:59.573
It's secluded.

08:59.673 --> 09:01.174
And it's 400 miles
from anybody that's

09:01.274 --> 09:02.309
ever seen us in our bathrobes.

09:02.409 --> 09:04.511
Oh!

09:04.612 --> 09:07.981
Look at this-- the
LaMont cabins, Boulder

09:08.081 --> 09:12.720
Lake, Rhinelander, Wisconsin.

09:12.820 --> 09:15.322
You're gonna take her camping?

09:15.422 --> 09:16.423
DAN: Campin'?

09:16.523 --> 09:18.626
We're talking luxury here.

09:18.726 --> 09:19.827
These cabins got everything.

09:19.927 --> 09:21.895
They've got electricity,
hot water, a full kitchen.

09:21.995 --> 09:22.963
Well, full kitchen.

09:23.063 --> 09:25.198
Gee, sis, that's
just the getaway

09:25.298 --> 09:26.333
you've been lookin' for.

09:29.169 --> 09:31.338
We'll be dining at the lodge.

09:31.438 --> 09:32.740
Well, maybe if
we're lucky we can

09:32.840 --> 09:35.909
get a table under the antlers.

09:36.009 --> 09:37.477
Well, for your information,
I talked to a guy

09:37.577 --> 09:39.647
down at the lumber yard
who went to this place,

09:39.747 --> 09:41.381
said he had the
time of his life.

09:41.481 --> 09:42.883
Did he say what kind
of time his wife had?

09:42.983 --> 09:44.652
He ain't married.

09:44.752 --> 09:46.586
Went there with a bunch
of buddies of his.

09:46.687 --> 09:47.955
Oh!

09:48.055 --> 09:52.259
[laughs] Geez, ah, now I don't
have the intense lumber yard

09:52.359 --> 09:56.163
connections that you
got, by I did manage

09:56.263 --> 10:01.068
to put together a honeymoon
in the Grand Duchess Hotel

10:01.168 --> 10:02.435
in Sarasota, Florida.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.576
"Grand Duchess
Resort Hotel, Sarasota,

10:09.677 --> 10:12.079
Florida, [inaudible]."

10:12.179 --> 10:14.447
Come on, it's the
perfect honeymoon spot.

10:14.547 --> 10:16.149
Look, and it's warm
and it's sunny.

10:16.249 --> 10:17.718
And not romantic.

10:17.818 --> 10:18.852
What are you talkin' about?

10:18.952 --> 10:20.654
Walking hand-in-hand on a beach.

10:20.754 --> 10:21.922
That ain't romantic.

10:22.022 --> 10:25.959
Yeah, dodgin' seagulls and
10,000 sunburned tourists?

10:26.059 --> 10:27.227
Honestly, Jackie, I ask you.

10:27.327 --> 10:28.195
Is that romantic?

10:28.295 --> 10:31.064
Well, coffee
shop's open till 9.

10:31.164 --> 10:33.934
Ooh!

10:34.034 --> 10:35.736
Well, now, who's
side are you on?

10:35.836 --> 10:37.270
I'm on your side.

10:37.370 --> 10:38.338
And I'm on your side.

10:38.438 --> 10:39.940
Just you-- just pick.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.475
Go anywhere.

10:42.575 --> 10:43.811
Well, I'm not going there.

10:43.911 --> 10:46.346
There's not-- nothing for me
to do in a place like that.

10:46.446 --> 10:47.547
What, are you nuts?

10:47.647 --> 10:49.783
There's plenty of stuff
for you to do there.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.251
There's stuff for you to do.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.620
There's huntin',
fishin', trackin' moose.

10:53.721 --> 10:54.554
What am I supposed to do?

10:54.654 --> 10:57.390
Forage for nuts and berries?

10:57.490 --> 10:58.591
Can I make a suggestion?

10:58.692 --> 11:01.528
BOTH: No.

11:01.628 --> 11:03.964
Honey, I am just
not gonna feel

11:04.064 --> 11:06.666
comfortable with some
place with the palm

11:06.767 --> 11:09.336
trees and marble floors.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.338
Well, you think I'm gonna
have fun at some place

11:11.438 --> 11:14.241
famous for lightning bugs?

11:14.341 --> 11:16.977
Well, then there's only
one way to settle it.

11:17.077 --> 11:18.278
Separate honeymoons.
- No.

11:18.378 --> 11:19.179
Hmm.

11:22.482 --> 11:23.884
All right.

11:23.984 --> 11:25.418
I'll settle it.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.020
Call it in the air,
heads or tails.

11:27.120 --> 11:27.921
Florida.

11:33.727 --> 11:37.530
Hey, get your grubby paw out
of that cereal box, would ya?

11:37.630 --> 11:39.599
I'm looking for the toy.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.770
Well, I already took
it out of there, see?

11:42.870 --> 11:45.472
Now, if you're real nice, maybe
I'll let you play with it.

11:45.572 --> 11:46.473
I'll be nice.

11:46.573 --> 11:49.743
Liar, liar pants on fire.

11:49.843 --> 11:51.745
You know, Dan, it's not too
late for you to change your mind

11:51.845 --> 11:54.748
and come with me to the
remarkable Sunshine State.

11:54.848 --> 11:57.985
But honey, there won't
be no sunshine for Florida.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.686
I won't be there.

11:59.787 --> 12:03.190
Well, I guess then I'll just
be sitting in my deluxe suite,

12:03.290 --> 12:05.826
crying out my eyes because I
can't share a concrete shower

12:05.926 --> 12:08.028
with four other cabins.

12:08.128 --> 12:09.329
[phone ringing]

12:09.429 --> 12:11.698
I bet that's the old
cabins right now, wondering

12:11.799 --> 12:13.801
what color bug light you want.

12:13.901 --> 12:15.268
DARLENE: I got it!

12:15.368 --> 12:17.137
Hey, are you all right?

12:17.237 --> 12:18.238
Sure, why?

12:18.338 --> 12:21.308
Well, you just walked
by a ringin' phone.

12:21.408 --> 12:24.044
Mom, please, I have a
lot of things on my mind.

12:24.144 --> 12:27.014
Hodge is gonna make me rip
the guts out of some frog.

12:27.114 --> 12:29.416
Yum, more cereal, anyone?

12:29.516 --> 12:31.318
Yes, please.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.486
I don't see how
any of you can eat.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.089
Pass the milk.

12:36.189 --> 12:37.190
There you go.

12:37.290 --> 12:40.093
I still don't know
what I'm gonna do, Mom.

12:40.193 --> 12:42.595
Well, you're gonna do
whatever you feel is right, OK?

12:42.695 --> 12:43.630
You keep the faith.

12:43.730 --> 12:46.266
Yeah.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.501
Darlene, who was that?

12:48.601 --> 12:51.771
Oh, it was Mr. Adelroy,
my boss at the newspaper.

12:51.872 --> 12:52.906
And what did he want?

12:53.006 --> 12:54.607
He wanted to see
me after school.

12:54.707 --> 12:56.576
I guess he didn't get
his paper yet either.

13:08.521 --> 13:09.322
Ah!

13:12.392 --> 13:13.526
Well, Mom, I did it.

13:13.626 --> 13:16.529
I told Hodges I wouldn't
cut up that frog.

13:16.629 --> 13:20.067
Well, I bet that frog is
pretty glad to hear that.

13:20.167 --> 13:21.634
Yeah, but Hodges wasn't.

13:21.734 --> 13:24.237
Thanks to him, I got
a C on my record.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.306
Well, you ought to be
proud of that C, Becky.

13:26.406 --> 13:27.474
I am.

13:27.574 --> 13:29.642
You put yourself on
the line for that.

13:29.742 --> 13:31.244
It's not fair.

13:31.344 --> 13:32.545
I'm the best student
in the class,

13:32.645 --> 13:35.048
and everyone else is gonna
get a better grade than me--

13:35.148 --> 13:37.284
than I.

13:37.384 --> 13:41.321
Well, nobody is gonna do
better than you in English.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.490
You know, when I told
Hodges I wouldn't do it,

13:43.590 --> 13:44.892
all the kids cheered.

13:44.992 --> 13:48.495
But then two seconds later, they
started cuttin' up their frogs.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.097
What a bunch of hypocrites.

13:50.197 --> 13:53.000
Well, you know, Becky, you are
the best student in that class.

13:53.100 --> 13:55.302
And it's just too bad they don't
give out grades for standing

13:55.402 --> 13:56.904
up for what you believe in.

13:57.004 --> 13:59.339
I still don't
believe I got a C.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.808
Well, come on, Becky,
if you wanted an A,

14:01.909 --> 14:03.343
you would have cut up
that frog, you know.

14:03.443 --> 14:06.013
But instead you did
the right thing,

14:06.113 --> 14:08.281
the hip thing, the now
thing, the happening thing,

14:08.381 --> 14:09.849
the '90s thing.

14:09.950 --> 14:13.020
Then how come I feel so lousy?

14:13.120 --> 14:14.487
You know, I think
it's because your body's

14:14.587 --> 14:19.726
starting to reject the C.

14:19.826 --> 14:22.395
(PIRATE VOICE) Where
be the white whale?

14:22.495 --> 14:25.032
Arrrg.

14:25.132 --> 14:25.933
Arrg.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.400
[phone ringing]

14:27.500 --> 14:29.336
Arr.

14:29.436 --> 14:31.271
[phone ringing]

14:31.371 --> 14:33.740
DJ, let me know if they run.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.675
I'm gonna go
upstairs and study.

14:35.775 --> 14:37.810
I can't afford to screw
anything else up this semester.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.316
Hey, stick 'em up.

14:43.416 --> 14:44.751
Don't try nothing
funny, partner.

14:44.851 --> 14:46.519
Just hand me over that money.

14:46.619 --> 14:47.420
How much is this?

14:47.520 --> 14:48.621
Mm.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.123
I don't know, but
it looks like a lot.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.458
What you gonna do with it?

14:51.558 --> 14:52.725
I don't know.

14:52.825 --> 14:54.161
Buy me something nice.

14:54.261 --> 14:55.828
What would you like?

14:55.929 --> 14:59.266
A honeymoon in
Sarasota, Florida.

14:59.366 --> 15:00.300
What's a honeymoon.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.201
I don't know.

15:01.301 --> 15:04.371
I never had one.

15:04.471 --> 15:06.206
DAN: Oh, Darlene?

15:06.306 --> 15:07.507
Ms. Clyde just called.

15:07.607 --> 15:08.942
She said she's looked
in all her puddles,

15:09.042 --> 15:11.011
and she still can't
find her newspaper.

15:11.111 --> 15:13.046
Well, that's not
my problem anymore.

15:13.146 --> 15:14.647
And why is that?

15:14.747 --> 15:18.451
Mr. Adelroy gave me the axe.

15:18.551 --> 15:20.787
Well, Darlene, now that
you've got some free time,

15:20.887 --> 15:22.355
could I get a minute with ya?

15:22.455 --> 15:23.957
Well, can I at
least get a snack

15:24.057 --> 15:25.392
before you chop my head off?

15:25.492 --> 15:26.293
No.

15:26.393 --> 15:28.228
Sit.

15:28.328 --> 15:31.798
[sighs] All right,
start talking.

15:31.898 --> 15:34.034
Well, it's a
long, boring story.

15:34.134 --> 15:36.203
That's a good beginning.

15:36.303 --> 15:37.637
Keep going.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.739
Well, I figured
a paper route was

15:39.839 --> 15:41.341
an easy way to make some money.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.742
[chuckles] Darlene.

15:42.842 --> 15:44.577
There's no easy
way to make money.

15:44.677 --> 15:48.548
If there was, your mother
would have found it by now.

15:48.648 --> 15:50.150
Now, let's face it, Darlene.

15:50.250 --> 15:54.321
You quit on the job a long
time before Adelroy fired ya.

15:54.421 --> 15:55.288
Maybe I did.

15:55.388 --> 15:56.889
You did.

15:56.990 --> 15:59.559
All right, but
I'm 11 years old.

15:59.659 --> 16:02.362
I figure, why not enjoy myself?

16:02.462 --> 16:04.964
I can live on my allowance
for a few more years.

16:05.065 --> 16:06.199
I don't know.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.568
I guess you ain't heard
about the layoff then, huh?

16:08.668 --> 16:12.939
Me and your daddy can only
afford to support two kids now.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.107
Well, who's gonna tell DJ?

16:17.144 --> 16:19.012
[laughs]

16:19.112 --> 16:20.780
Hey, you're gonna
be proud of Becky.

16:20.880 --> 16:21.681
Why's that?

16:21.781 --> 16:24.151
Because she took
a C in biology

16:24.251 --> 16:26.886
rather than commit
animal genocide.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.021
Good for her.

16:28.121 --> 16:32.625
Hey, I got four C's and
nobody congratulated me.

16:32.725 --> 16:34.294
C's come easy for you, honey.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.629
Yeah, Becky really
had to work for her C.

16:36.729 --> 16:39.366
Well, the first one was
the hardest for me too.

16:39.466 --> 16:41.268
[laughs]

16:43.736 --> 16:47.607
You know, Dan, I
really adore your kids.

16:47.707 --> 16:48.508
Yeah?

16:48.608 --> 16:51.111
I say we're three for three.

16:51.211 --> 16:53.480
You know, I think
our first real try

16:53.580 --> 16:55.582
was on my cousin's house boat.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.250
Zzz.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.585
You know, the only
thing I was really

16:58.685 --> 17:03.623
trying to conceive on that
houseboat was an escape route.

17:03.723 --> 17:04.557
You guys busy?

17:04.657 --> 17:05.792
No, we were just
sittin' around

17:05.892 --> 17:08.595
waiting for you to show up.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.430
You know, every
time you arrive, it's

17:10.530 --> 17:11.798
the highlight of Dan's day.

17:11.898 --> 17:14.033
Well, it is today,
because I've been spending

17:14.134 --> 17:15.968
a lot of time since
yesterday thinking

17:16.069 --> 17:17.204
about your guys' honeymoon.

17:17.304 --> 17:18.838
You ain't goin' with us.

17:18.938 --> 17:20.273
On the contrary.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.442
You guys have been arguing
about it for 15 years.

17:22.542 --> 17:25.245
You're gonna spend the next
15 years arguing about it.

17:25.345 --> 17:27.580
So I decided that since you
guys weren't gonna take one

17:27.680 --> 17:29.015
that I was gonna give you one.

17:29.116 --> 17:30.683
What're you talking about?

17:30.783 --> 17:34.854
I booked a suite for the
weekend at Wizard World.

17:34.954 --> 17:37.023
Oh boy, Wizard World.

17:37.124 --> 17:38.325
JACKIE: [laughs]

17:39.592 --> 17:42.829
What, with a wacky
wigglin' worm water ride?

17:42.929 --> 17:45.031
Boy, I bet you never thought
we'd be spendin' the weekend

17:45.132 --> 17:45.932
there, huh?

17:46.032 --> 17:46.833
Not weally.

17:46.933 --> 17:48.668
Oh, forget it!

17:48.768 --> 17:50.937
You guys aren't going.

17:51.037 --> 17:51.971
Becky!

17:52.071 --> 17:52.872
Darlene!

17:52.972 --> 17:53.773
DJ!

17:53.873 --> 17:54.674
Front and center!

17:54.774 --> 17:55.675
What're you up to?

17:55.775 --> 17:57.377
I'm running away
for the weekend,

17:57.477 --> 17:58.578
and I'm taking
your kids with me,

17:58.678 --> 18:00.046
and you guys get to
stay here in the house

18:00.147 --> 18:01.181
and have your honeymoon.

18:01.281 --> 18:02.115
You mean--

18:02.215 --> 18:03.216
Ew, I have to
be alone with you?

18:03.316 --> 18:04.151
A girl!

18:04.251 --> 18:05.051
Ew!

18:05.152 --> 18:06.085
Ew!

18:06.186 --> 18:07.687
And you better
make the most of it

18:07.787 --> 18:09.956
too, because that's the last
anniversary present you're

18:10.056 --> 18:11.991
getting for the next 10 years.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.126
Oh, that's so sweet!

18:13.226 --> 18:14.026
All right!

18:14.127 --> 18:15.128
Thank you, sis.

18:15.228 --> 18:17.864
You guys, pack your
bags, 'cause we're going

18:17.964 --> 18:18.798
to Wizard World!

18:18.898 --> 18:19.699
All right!

18:19.799 --> 18:20.600
Wizard World, really?

18:20.700 --> 18:22.702
For the whole weekend!

18:22.802 --> 18:24.637
Are Mom and Dad coming?
JACKIE: No!

18:24.737 --> 18:25.872
ALL: Yes!

18:25.972 --> 18:28.341
[cheering]

18:51.598 --> 18:53.433
Rosie, what are you doing?

18:53.533 --> 18:55.368
Don't you worry about it.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.637
You ready to start?

18:57.737 --> 18:58.538
I guess so.

19:03.510 --> 19:04.844
[giggling]

19:06.179 --> 19:07.780
This is weird.

19:07.880 --> 19:10.517
I keep waiting for a kid to
come tearing in through here.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.519
Well, Dan, now, we
don't have any kids,

19:12.619 --> 19:15.021
you know, because
we're on our honeymoon.

19:15.121 --> 19:15.922
What are you doin'?

19:16.022 --> 19:18.425
Sit.

19:18.525 --> 19:20.660
[inaudible].

19:20.760 --> 19:21.794
OK.

19:21.894 --> 19:25.665
Our honeymoon has
officially started.

19:25.765 --> 19:26.833
It has?

19:26.933 --> 19:29.802
Yeah, how do you like
our honeymoon suite?

19:29.902 --> 19:31.304
I like it.

19:31.404 --> 19:35.007
It has nice, homey,
lived-in feel to it.

19:35.107 --> 19:37.710
Are you ready for romance?

19:37.810 --> 19:38.778
Are you?

19:38.878 --> 19:39.879
I was born ready.

19:43.816 --> 19:44.717
Nice touch.

19:44.817 --> 19:46.419
I didn't even get
to the touching yet.

19:49.889 --> 19:54.761
Now, would you like candle
light or candle light?

19:54.861 --> 19:57.597
How about candlelight?

19:57.697 --> 20:00.032
[romantic music playing]

20:10.410 --> 20:12.812
OK, now, which
one do you want?

20:12.912 --> 20:16.849
A ripplin' stream or
a waterfall effect?

20:16.949 --> 20:19.486
DAN: Surprise me.

20:19.586 --> 20:20.387
All right.

20:20.487 --> 20:21.854
[water dripping]

20:21.954 --> 20:23.456
There's one ripplin' stream.

20:23.556 --> 20:26.726
DAN: [laughs] That's nice.

20:26.826 --> 20:28.227
Waterfall might be nicer.

20:28.328 --> 20:29.696
ROSEANNE: You've got it.

20:29.796 --> 20:32.064
[water pouring]

20:35.067 --> 20:36.102
Watch out for the mist.

20:48.214 --> 20:50.517
Well, this is the
honeymoon I've always wanted.

20:50.617 --> 20:53.185
Niagara Falls!

20:53.286 --> 20:54.086
Niagara Falls!

20:58.391 --> 21:01.361
