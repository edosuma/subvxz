<i> ( thunder )</i>

00:21.622 --> 00:26.692
<i> ( music playing )</i>

00:45.646 --> 00:47.746
Woman:<i> Oh, my God.</i>
<i> Say something.</i>

00:47.748 --> 00:49.081
Man:
<i> What-- what should I say?</i>

00:49.083 --> 00:50.349
Woman:
<i> Anything. I just--</i>

00:50.351 --> 00:52.184
<i> I just need to</i>
<i> hear your accent.</i>

00:52.186 --> 00:54.053
Man:<i> Well, technically,</i>
<i> if you're the tourist,</i>

00:54.055 --> 00:55.120
-<i> then you're the one with--</i>
- Woman:<i> Oh, my God.</i>

00:55.122 --> 00:57.589
<i> Shut up. Don't move.</i>

00:57.591 --> 01:00.826
Uh-huh. Don't move.

01:00.828 --> 01:04.763
( both moaning )

01:04.765 --> 01:07.599
No. Grab me!

01:07.601 --> 01:09.835
All right, okay.

01:09.837 --> 01:11.837
Just like that.

01:11.839 --> 01:14.606
( both moaning )

01:14.608 --> 01:17.476
Now turn me over.

01:17.478 --> 01:20.112
- Oh, Statton.
- Oh, baby.

01:20.114 --> 01:23.682
- Mmm. Statton.
- Oh, baby, baby, baby.

01:23.684 --> 01:25.818
Woman:
Say my name.

01:25.820 --> 01:29.521
Say my name!

01:29.523 --> 01:31.490
- Anne?
- What?

01:33.360 --> 01:36.361
- Anne?
- You don't know my name.

01:36.363 --> 01:38.530
I'm-- I'm sorry.
I'm bad with names.

01:38.532 --> 01:39.731
Well, don't you think
you should at least

01:39.733 --> 01:41.300
try to remember
the name of the person--

01:41.302 --> 01:43.302
I did. I did try.
I did a mnemonic.

01:43.304 --> 01:46.839
- What?
- I read a book which taught you
how to remember names,

01:46.841 --> 01:49.541
and one way is to think
of someone with the same name,

01:49.543 --> 01:51.543
- and my sister's name
is Anne-Marie, so--
- You were thinking

01:51.545 --> 01:53.245
of your sister
when we were screwing?

01:53.247 --> 01:56.515
No, no, no.
When we first met.

01:56.517 --> 02:00.152
My sister's name is Anne-Marie,
so I used her as a mnemonic.

02:00.154 --> 02:04.389
So I knew it was either
Anne or Marie, I just
couldn't remember which.

02:04.391 --> 02:08.560
And I was too embarrassed
to ask again, 'cause we were
already, you know,

02:08.562 --> 02:13.465
kissing by then, so--
well, I'm guessing it's Marie.

02:14.568 --> 02:17.302
- It's Mary.
- Oh.

02:18.572 --> 02:21.406
Sorry.
I must have misheard.

02:21.408 --> 02:23.342
That bar was so noisy.

02:23.344 --> 02:25.277
You heard me offer
to go to bed with you.

02:25.279 --> 02:26.812
Well, if I'd heard you say
your name was Mary,

02:26.814 --> 02:28.514
it would have been no problem.
My dog's called Mary.

02:28.516 --> 02:30.149
- I could have pictured her.
- Oh, my fuck.

02:30.151 --> 02:31.650
- Oh, no, no.
- God!

02:31.652 --> 02:33.752
I'm not saying
that you remind me
of a dog or anything.

02:33.754 --> 02:36.355
- I was just--
- You were just saying
that to remember my name,

02:36.357 --> 02:38.757
you had to bring
your sister, your dog,

02:38.759 --> 02:41.293
and your grandmother
into bed with us.

02:41.295 --> 02:44.329
Well, I remember your name.

02:44.331 --> 02:47.866
It's Statton. Statton Taylor.

02:47.868 --> 02:52.704
That's 'cause it's unusual.
The-- the book says it's easy
to remember unusual names.

02:52.706 --> 02:55.307
Plus, people tend to picture
the Staten Island ferry.

02:55.309 --> 02:57.309
So what?
I should change my name
to Eiffel Tower

02:57.311 --> 02:59.311
- to make things
easier for you?
- No, no. I'm just saying

02:59.313 --> 03:01.547
you probably visualized
the Staten Island ferry

03:01.549 --> 03:03.849
- without realizing it.
- No, I didn't.

03:03.851 --> 03:07.319
I was just interested enough
in who I was sleeping with

03:07.321 --> 03:09.454
to remember his name.

03:09.456 --> 03:12.257
So, did you know you were
going to sleep with me

03:12.259 --> 03:13.759
when I first
introduced myself?

03:13.761 --> 03:15.727
You always know.

03:15.729 --> 03:16.895
I've never been surprised

03:16.897 --> 03:19.298
to find myself
in bed with anyone.

03:20.634 --> 03:23.635
- Have you?
- Frequently.

03:23.637 --> 03:26.371
I'm always surprised that
anyone wants to sleep with me.

03:26.373 --> 03:29.341
Frequently?
How often do you do this?

03:29.343 --> 03:31.210
Oh, hardly ever.

03:33.847 --> 03:36.848
That's a lie.

03:38.485 --> 03:39.785
Never ever.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.990
I never have one-night stands.

03:44.992 --> 03:49.561
Well, you're definitely
not completing this one.

03:51.632 --> 03:52.965
Man:
Stay right where you are.

03:58.005 --> 04:00.939
Do you like cop shows?
Huh? Go to the movies?

04:00.941 --> 04:03.842
Then you're both over-qualified
to survive this episode.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.310
We're here for your stuff.

04:05.312 --> 04:08.013
Yeah, we like shiny stuff.

04:08.015 --> 04:10.015
Jewelry, laptops, phones.

04:10.017 --> 04:13.252
Watches, credit cards,
small change.

04:13.254 --> 04:14.686
My friend here
will take your things.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.755
I will remove your jewelry.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.824
Now from the conversation
we've just overheard,

04:18.826 --> 04:23.695
Statton, you--
you'd like to impress
this lady, eh? Am I right?

04:23.697 --> 04:25.597
And even I know
her name is Mary.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.332
- Not that.
- Ooh!

04:27.334 --> 04:30.702
Bravery will be rewarded
with a hole in the head.

04:30.704 --> 04:34.473
And cooperation...

04:34.475 --> 04:37.476
will be rewarded with a smile.

04:37.478 --> 04:41.747
Just think of your online
status, Statton Taylor.

04:41.749 --> 04:45.584
- ( whimpers )
- "Survived being robbed
at gunpoint."

04:45.586 --> 04:49.888
"Thumbs up, Mary."
Like, like, like, like,
like, like, like.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.624
( whimpering )

04:54.728 --> 04:58.030
Would you get off
the bed, please?

05:04.938 --> 05:06.672
- Come on, on with it!
- ( whimpers )

05:06.674 --> 05:09.741
- ( gunshots )
- ( gasps )

05:09.743 --> 05:11.743
( grunting )

05:11.745 --> 05:15.580
- Oh,<i> schiesse.</i>
- You fucking shot me.

05:15.582 --> 05:17.983
- Why'd you fucking shoot me?
- Well, you started it.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.751
There was somebody
in the wardrobe.

05:19.753 --> 05:22.020
It's a fucking mirror,
you Magoo.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.556
- You saw his reflection.
- Yeah, well, who the fuck
were you shooting at?

05:24.558 --> 05:27.526
I thought there was someone
shooting behind me,
which there was!

05:27.528 --> 05:30.362
Only I didn't know
it was my fucking sidekick.

05:30.364 --> 05:32.931
If anyone's
a fucking sidekick,
okay, it is you.

05:32.933 --> 05:36.568
- You're a fucking sidekick.
- Well, I'm not the one with
a fucking bullet in my leg.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.503
Fuck you.
Whose room is this?

05:38.505 --> 05:40.372
- Which one of you booked?
- It's mine. It's mine.

05:40.374 --> 05:42.474
Yeah? You get up, okay?

05:42.476 --> 05:44.476
Call the front desk
and say you've just been--

05:44.478 --> 05:46.611
you've just been disturbed
by the bangs that you heard
down the corridor.

05:46.613 --> 05:49.715
- What the fuck?
- You always have to alert
the authorities, okay?

05:49.717 --> 05:52.451
Alert the authorities
and they'll never suspect you.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.954
- Do it.
- All right.
Okay, okay, okay,

05:55.956 --> 05:59.825
- Okay.
-<i> ( phone beeps )</i>

05:59.827 --> 06:02.127
( grunting )
Hello.

06:02.129 --> 06:05.097
( stammers )
My name's Statton Taylor.
I'm in room, uh...

06:05.099 --> 06:07.499
- Keep it natural.
Keep it natural.
- ...uh, 304.

06:07.501 --> 06:10.469
- Um, I just heard
two loud shots.
- Bangs!

06:10.471 --> 06:12.137
- Bangs!
- Bangs. Bangs! Uh, uh--

06:12.139 --> 06:13.805
They might have not been shots.
It could have been anything.

06:13.807 --> 06:15.774
Tell them that you need
your sleep, okay?

06:15.776 --> 06:17.642
You don't want to be disturbed
and you've got a thing
in the morning.

06:17.644 --> 06:21.546
I don't want to be disturbed.
I got a thing in the morning.

06:21.548 --> 06:22.814
- Early!
- An early work--

06:22.816 --> 06:25.650
I have early work
in the morning.

06:25.652 --> 06:28.453
Okay. Yes, please
don't disturb me.

06:28.455 --> 06:30.822
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Okay, thank you very much.

06:30.824 --> 06:34.092
Thank you. Okay, bye.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.528
- What did he say?
- He said they heard it.

06:36.530 --> 06:39.998
- And?
- They're looking into it.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.734
- Right, we need to go.
- No, no, no, no, no.

06:42.736 --> 06:45.170
I can't go through reception
dripping with blood.

06:45.172 --> 06:46.805
They're looking
for a guy with a gun,

06:46.807 --> 06:49.074
and I got a fucking hole
in my leg.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.810
Right. What do you
want me to do?

06:51.812 --> 06:54.780
I just want you to watch me
bleed to death, okay?

06:54.782 --> 06:57.582
Just go.
Just get somebody, okay?

06:57.584 --> 06:59.618
Well, I cannot call
a fucking ambulance, can I?

06:59.620 --> 07:04.189
No, no, Will--
Will's brother, okay,
is a doctor, all right?

07:04.191 --> 07:08.160
- He's fucking 12!
- His older brother.

07:08.162 --> 07:11.129
Right, okay.
Keep your fucking leg on.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.165
Take that, right?
In case I get searched
on my way out.

07:13.167 --> 07:16.668
Keep one trained on each
of their fucking heads.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.103
Um, um, um, look--

07:18.105 --> 07:19.871
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Don't.

07:23.043 --> 07:26.845
Look, um,
I know you don't care,

07:26.847 --> 07:29.214
but that pendant...

07:29.216 --> 07:32.784
I really need it.
It was my mother's.

07:32.786 --> 07:36.922
It's-- it's of great
sentimental value to me.

07:36.924 --> 07:40.892
Oh, well, um, okay.

07:40.894 --> 07:43.228
Money is of great
sentimental value to me,

07:43.230 --> 07:45.964
and I know a man
who will give me cash.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.634
God fucking damn it.

07:56.243 --> 07:59.644
( stammering )
Can I get dressed, please?

08:01.748 --> 08:03.081
Slowly.

08:10.958 --> 08:15.126
- Can I get dressed?
- Do you have to?

08:35.849 --> 08:38.817
Mary, can you bring
that sheet over, please?

08:40.954 --> 08:42.020
( grunts )

08:47.294 --> 08:48.827
Can you tie it
around my leg?

08:54.134 --> 08:56.201
( exhales sharply )

08:56.203 --> 08:59.971
- ( grunts )
- Thank you, Mary.
Thank you, Mary.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.773
Thank you very much.

09:08.982 --> 09:12.017
- Whose credit cards are these?
- They're mine.

09:12.019 --> 09:14.986
Says "Carol. Carol Page."

09:14.988 --> 09:19.157
I think if there's one thing
we've all learned tonight,

09:19.159 --> 09:21.593
is that your name
is definitely Mary.

09:21.595 --> 09:24.796
Are these stolen credit cards?
'Cause I do not want
stolen credit cards.

09:24.798 --> 09:29.768
They're not stolen.
Carol's my real name.

09:31.338 --> 09:34.272
You gave me a fake name?

09:34.274 --> 09:35.874
Whatevs.
It was a one-night stand.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.709
I gave you a fake
phone number as well.

09:37.711 --> 09:39.744
Then why were you so upset
that I didn't call you Marie?

09:39.746 --> 09:41.713
- Mary!
- Mary, for fuck's sake.

09:41.715 --> 09:43.615
It doesn't matter!
It's not even her real name!

09:43.617 --> 09:45.350
It was the name
that I told you,

09:45.352 --> 09:48.153
so, you know,
it's still rude of you
to not remember it.

09:48.155 --> 09:50.255
Well, why did you want
to hear me say it if it's not
even your name?

09:50.257 --> 09:52.324
'Cause I knew
you'd forgotten it.

09:52.326 --> 09:56.094
I could tell by the way
you kept saying,
"Oh, baby, baby, baby."

09:56.096 --> 09:58.363
- ( chuckles )
- So you were testing me
during sex?

09:58.365 --> 10:00.699
That's entrapment.
That is nice.

10:00.701 --> 10:05.870
Remembering the fake name
I gave you is
the minimum requirement.

10:05.872 --> 10:09.007
And, anyway,
it's sort of my name.

10:09.009 --> 10:12.110
Sort of? How can it be
sort of your name?

10:12.112 --> 10:16.881
It was my name
when I was a nun.

10:16.883 --> 10:18.883
You were a nun?

10:18.885 --> 10:21.386
I was a novice for, like,
two years when I was young.

10:21.388 --> 10:24.623
I was Sister Mary Catherine.

10:24.625 --> 10:27.892
You wanted him to call you
by your nun name
while you did it?

10:27.894 --> 10:30.395
- Well, that's hot.
- Not because of that, no.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.163
Do you mind?
This is private.

10:32.165 --> 10:35.400
Yeah. I'm feeling a bit
like a fifth wheel.

10:35.402 --> 10:36.801
You want me to go?

10:40.741 --> 10:42.240
- Have you still
got the habit?
- Oh, come on.

10:42.242 --> 10:45.410
- Oh, my God.
- ( chuckles )

10:45.412 --> 10:47.412
Do you still have
the habit?

10:47.414 --> 10:49.114
Not on me, no.

10:49.116 --> 10:52.917
Of course.
Sorry, sorry.

10:52.919 --> 10:56.287
So, uh,
you're a Catholic boy,
too, then, eh?

10:56.289 --> 10:58.089
Yeah.

10:58.091 --> 11:01.126
Do you go to St. Godfrey's?
I feel like I recognize you.

11:01.128 --> 11:03.995
I just got one
of those faces.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.397
What are the chances, eh?

11:05.399 --> 11:07.966
Three strangers,
all of us Catholic.

11:07.968 --> 11:12.103
- I'm not.
- You were a nun.

11:12.105 --> 11:14.806
How can you be a nun
and not be Catholic?

11:14.808 --> 11:17.942
It's one of those questions
they never ask.

11:17.944 --> 11:20.812
They just assume
if you sign up to be a nun,

11:20.814 --> 11:22.681
you know, must be Catholic.

11:22.683 --> 11:26.017
Always go to the authorities
and they never suspect a thing.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.819
- Does that always work?
- No.

11:27.821 --> 11:32.323
Yes. I learned it when I went
to London when I was 19.

11:32.325 --> 11:35.326
- What, like in crime training?
- No, going to the opera.

11:35.328 --> 11:38.063
- The opera?
- Well, don't stereotype me,
mate.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.998
- I wasn't.
- Not everyone with a gun

11:40.000 --> 11:43.168
- is uncultured.
- Carry on the story.
I want to hear.

11:43.170 --> 11:48.306
When I first went to London,
okay, I was, uh,

11:48.308 --> 11:51.476
training to be
an opera singer.

11:51.478 --> 11:55.313
And, uh, we used to go
to the interval,

11:55.315 --> 11:57.315
and, uh, no one
would check the tickets,

11:57.317 --> 11:59.050
so we'd just jump in
a spare seat.

11:59.052 --> 12:02.754
This one time,
I went with my mate Callum,

12:02.756 --> 12:04.856
and they were sold out
and I was about
to do a runner,

12:04.858 --> 12:08.793
and he went up to this usher,
who was a beautiful girl.

12:08.795 --> 12:11.162
And he said to her,
"Have I got time to go

12:11.164 --> 12:12.864
to the toilet
before it starts?"

12:12.866 --> 12:16.501
She says, "You can go
to the toilet, but...

12:16.503 --> 12:18.503
I'll have to put you
in a private box."

12:18.505 --> 12:24.509
So, uh, we watched
the second half of "Tosca"

12:24.511 --> 12:27.245
in a private box like kings.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.114
Amazing.

12:29.116 --> 12:31.750
And after the opera,
Callum shagged the usher.

12:33.887 --> 12:36.121
It was a beautiful night.

12:42.863 --> 12:45.447
That was lovely.

12:45.448 --> 12:48.032
So, you're an opera singer?
What happened?

12:48.034 --> 12:50.368
Oh, it's a very competitive
field, you know?

12:50.370 --> 12:53.371
You gotta be really good
to progress and...

12:53.373 --> 12:59.210
this is an opportunity
for some fast cash.

12:59.212 --> 13:01.946
And then one thing
led to a...

13:01.948 --> 13:03.948
hole in the leg.

13:03.950 --> 13:07.352
What was your biggest part?

13:07.354 --> 13:10.822
Pirate King
of "Pirates of Penzance."

13:10.824 --> 13:12.891
- ( chuckles )
- Wow.

13:12.893 --> 13:16.060
Just a tour. Just a tour,
but mainly to tourists.

13:16.062 --> 13:18.029
- It's impressive.
- Mm-hmm.

13:20.066 --> 13:22.400
Could you sing
something for us?

13:22.402 --> 13:25.303
- Yeah.
- It might take your mind
off your leg.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.573
- No.
- Oh, go on.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.975
- Please.
- No, I couldn't.

13:32.813 --> 13:34.546
Oh, it's a non-smoking room.

13:34.548 --> 13:37.048
I need to do something
for my pain, mate.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.017
Can I have one then?

13:47.327 --> 13:49.828
It's a non-smoking room.

13:49.830 --> 13:51.429
We won't tell if you won't.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.364
Yeah, Statton,
live a little.

14:06.146 --> 14:11.950
¶ I am the Pirate King ¶

14:11.952 --> 14:15.186
¶ And it is, it is
a glorious thing ¶

14:15.188 --> 14:21.192
¶ To be the Pirate King ¶

14:24.464 --> 14:28.633
¶ Oh, better far
to live and die ¶

14:28.635 --> 14:32.270
¶ Under the brave
black flag I fly ¶

14:32.272 --> 14:35.073
¶ Than play
a sanctimonious part ¶

14:35.075 --> 14:38.977
¶ With a pirate head
and a pirate heart ¶

14:38.979 --> 14:43.381
¶ I'll be true
to the song I sing ¶

14:43.383 --> 14:46.251
¶ And live and die ¶

14:46.253 --> 14:50.154
¶ A Pirate King ¶

14:58.498 --> 15:03.301
¶ For I am the Pirate King ¶

15:03.303 --> 15:05.670
¶ Hurrah, hurrah,
for the Pirate King ¶

15:05.672 --> 15:08.006
¶ It is, it is
a glorious thing ¶

15:08.008 --> 15:10.041
¶ To be a Pirate King ¶

15:10.043 --> 15:12.110
¶ It is, hurrah for
the Pirate King ¶

15:12.112 --> 15:18.182
- ¶ Hurrah ¶
- ¶ The Pirate King ¶

15:19.586 --> 15:23.288
( smoke alarm beeping )

15:23.290 --> 15:24.489
Fuck.

15:30.530 --> 15:31.696
Oh, fuck.

15:31.698 --> 15:33.197
Fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck.

15:35.235 --> 15:37.035
( knocking on door )

15:37.037 --> 15:38.536
Man:
Mr. Taylor?

15:38.538 --> 15:40.605
It's the hotel duty manager.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.543
- Get rid of him.
- How?

15:45.545 --> 15:48.546
Answer the door
and say you were
disturbed by a shot.

15:48.548 --> 15:52.383
- A shot or a bang?
- Bang, okay?

15:52.385 --> 15:56.120
Okay, no funny business,
'cause remember--
get on there.

15:56.122 --> 15:58.489
Remember,
I've got a gun pointed at
your girlfriend's head, mate.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.158
Mary:
Girlfriend?

16:01.494 --> 16:04.495
- Man: Mr. Taylor?
- ( knocking )

16:04.497 --> 16:05.563
Mr. Taylor?

16:08.568 --> 16:10.301
Fuck it!
I'll go, I'll go.

16:10.303 --> 16:13.338
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go.

16:19.980 --> 16:21.612
What's going on, huh?

16:21.614 --> 16:24.382
I was just woken up by an alarm
and then a shot-- bang.

16:25.752 --> 16:28.486
Whatever.
And now you're thumping
on my door.

16:28.488 --> 16:31.122
Sorry, Mr. Taylor.

16:31.124 --> 16:35.126
We had a complaint about,
uh, some kind of singing

16:35.128 --> 16:38.596
- coming from your room.
- That was next door.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.131
I was gonna complain
about that, too.

16:40.133 --> 16:42.433
Okay, I'm going for his gun.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.469
He's wounded.
We can overpower him.

16:44.471 --> 16:47.438
- No, no. He'll kill us.
- He might kill us anyway.
Come on.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.607
I got an ace up my sleeve.
I've remembered where
I know him from.

16:49.609 --> 16:51.442
- What? Where?
- His name's Kipper.

16:51.444 --> 16:53.778
- Oh, his name you remember?
- Well, I pictured a herring,

16:53.780 --> 16:56.614
- and the book says it's easier
to remember unusual names.
- Oh, my fuck!

16:56.616 --> 16:59.517
- Look, when I tell him--
- Do not fucking tell him.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.786
- What?
- If he knows you,
he'll have to kill you.

17:01.788 --> 17:05.156
- Why?
- Statton, I don't want to die,

17:05.158 --> 17:08.292
and neither do you,
so shut the fuck up,
and follow my lead.

17:08.294 --> 17:09.360
But he--

17:24.677 --> 17:27.612
I think you were right.
I do remember you.

17:27.614 --> 17:33.117
No, I just think
you got one of those faces,
like you said.

17:33.119 --> 17:35.686
How can it be my face
if I remember you?

17:38.224 --> 17:41.659
You...

17:41.661 --> 17:43.494
were at Danno's party.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.166
No, I-- I don't think I was.

17:48.168 --> 17:51.135
Yes! Danno's!

17:51.137 --> 17:52.804
You're the piano tuner guy.

17:52.806 --> 17:54.806
We were doing shots
in the kitchen.

17:54.808 --> 17:59.310
Oh, that Danno, yes.
Yes, I was. Yes.

17:59.312 --> 18:02.213
- Sorry.
- I totally remember you.

18:02.215 --> 18:04.449
So, you live around here?

18:04.451 --> 18:07.518
- Mm-hmm.
- Then why are we in a hotel?

18:09.756 --> 18:11.556
Come on, Statton.

18:11.558 --> 18:14.525
You don't want to die
with a lie on your conscience.

18:14.527 --> 18:17.728
That is true. As a Catholic,
it's highly inadvisable.

18:20.533 --> 18:23.868
I, um, still live
with my wife.

18:23.870 --> 18:27.305
- Oh, Jesus.
- No, we're separated.

18:27.307 --> 18:29.373
I sleep on the sofa
in the living room.

18:29.375 --> 18:31.375
Just hasn't been
the right time to leave.

18:31.377 --> 18:34.312
Sure, you're separated,
but you still live together.

18:34.314 --> 18:37.548
- Totally believable.
- I promise you, she won't
mind me being here.

18:37.550 --> 18:40.651
- I could introduce you,
if you like.
- No, I'm fine, really.

18:43.890 --> 18:47.725
So, uh,
how do you know Danno?

18:47.727 --> 18:49.627
Well, my mate Theo
is his supplier.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.329
You're a drug dealer, too?

18:51.331 --> 18:54.398
No. Theo's a drug dealer.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.634
I would never be
a drug dealer.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.403
It's too fussy.
Might as well be a shopkeeper.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.808
<i>( cell phone ringing )</i>

19:07.413 --> 19:09.280
Oh.

19:09.282 --> 19:11.849
Yeah? What do you got?

19:11.851 --> 19:15.653
Will's brother
is cave-diving in Azerbaijan.

19:15.655 --> 19:18.923
- I'm fucking dying here.
-<i> Yeah, I know.</i>

19:18.925 --> 19:21.225
-<i> I'm exploring other options.</i>
- Like what?

19:21.227 --> 19:25.596
- Theo knows this vet.
- A vet? Victor the vet?

19:25.598 --> 19:27.798
Yeah, I think he said
his name was Victor, yeah.

19:27.800 --> 19:30.268
Well, he's not even a real vet.
He got his diploma
on the Internet.

19:30.270 --> 19:33.704
Well, Theo swears by him.
Said he was a star when
his wee doggie got shot.

19:33.706 --> 19:36.274
I won't see a vet without
proper qualifications.

19:36.276 --> 19:39.610
Hey, that doggie has little
wheels on his back legs now.

19:39.612 --> 19:43.714
Are you telling me
that his last patient
is now a paraplegic?

19:45.318 --> 19:47.952
Yeah, all right,
I'll sort something else out.

19:47.954 --> 19:51.222
And a packet
of chewing gum, please.
Sugar-free.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.492
How's the situation now?

19:54.494 --> 19:57.628
Oh, ahem, yeah,
situation's under control, Dec.

19:57.630 --> 20:00.631
You'll never guess.

20:00.633 --> 20:03.935
Statton and I have met before
at one of Danno's parties.

20:05.505 --> 20:08.372
What the fuck?
Are you a chartered moron?

20:08.374 --> 20:11.442
If he knows you,
he can ID you.

20:11.444 --> 20:13.644
If they can hear you,
don't say a fucking word.

20:16.482 --> 20:19.584
This is why you
are the sidekick.

20:19.586 --> 20:24.355
Fuck you. What do I do?

20:24.357 --> 20:27.692
Well, you're gonna
have to kill 'em.

20:27.694 --> 20:28.960
What?

20:28.962 --> 20:32.997
Well, I, uh--
I've, uh, never--

20:32.999 --> 20:36.801
never really had any experience
in that kind of area before.

20:36.803 --> 20:40.972
Are you trying to tell me
that you have never killed
anyone before?

20:40.974 --> 20:42.506
That's correct.

20:42.508 --> 20:46.310
Jesus. You must have.

20:46.312 --> 20:48.346
- Well, I haven't.
-<i> Are you sure?</i>

20:48.348 --> 20:50.448
Well, I'm pretty sure
I'd remember
that sort of thing.

20:50.450 --> 20:52.984
Jesus, Kipper.

20:52.986 --> 20:56.854
And, um, you know, there's been
a little bit of bonding,

20:56.856 --> 20:59.290
and, uh, reminiscences
and all that.

20:59.292 --> 21:01.726
I have three previous.

21:01.728 --> 21:03.527
I'm on parole.

21:03.529 --> 21:07.031
I will get 20 years
for armed robbery.

21:07.033 --> 21:09.634
I am not gonna do
20 fucking years

21:09.636 --> 21:11.636
'cause you're a French fancy!

21:14.540 --> 21:15.973
All right.

21:17.577 --> 21:18.976
You'll have to kill her, too.

21:18.978 --> 21:22.713
No. No.

21:22.715 --> 21:28.886
-<i> No, no.</i>
- She will see you kill him.

21:28.888 --> 21:31.756
We can't have her being
a witness to that, can we?

21:35.895 --> 21:36.961
I can't do it.

21:39.365 --> 21:41.332
All right, I'll do it,

21:41.334 --> 21:44.068
if you admit
you're the sidekick.

21:44.070 --> 21:47.905
You're wrong.
It got a lot friendly,
and you don't shoot a friend.

21:47.907 --> 21:50.808
I'm a lot less shootable
now that he knows me socially.

21:50.810 --> 21:53.077
No, no, no.
You're wrong.

21:53.079 --> 21:56.414
He can't let you go,
so now he can't let me go.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.483
( Kipper whispering )

21:59.485 --> 22:00.918
As soon as this is through

22:00.920 --> 22:03.754
I'm taking Tina
and the kids...

22:03.756 --> 22:06.824
( continues whispering )

22:13.766 --> 22:16.534
Drop the gun and the phone.

22:18.738 --> 22:22.506
- How did you get that?
- You left it on the chair,
Pirate King.

22:24.977 --> 22:26.977
I am the sidekick.

22:38.958 --> 22:41.592
Hello,
my name's Statton Taylor.
I'm in room 304.

22:41.594 --> 22:43.961
We need police
and ambulance right away.

22:43.963 --> 22:45.863
Oh, thank you very much.
Okay, bye.

22:48.134 --> 22:50.968
Police are on their way up
'cause of the earlier bangs--
shot, shots.

22:50.970 --> 22:52.403
- Statton?
- Hmm?

22:52.405 --> 22:55.039
- Get the gun.
- Oh, right.

23:00.646 --> 23:04.815
Please, give me a chance.
Give me a head start, okay?

23:04.817 --> 23:07.618
I've got kids,
I'm an opera singer, and...

23:07.620 --> 23:09.987
I'm clearly not good
at this.

23:11.991 --> 23:14.992
I'll quit.

23:14.994 --> 23:16.927
I'll go into teaching.

23:23.870 --> 23:26.470
( screaming )

23:26.472 --> 23:30.608
- Police! Get on the floor!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Get on the floor!

23:30.610 --> 23:33.511
Thank Christ you're here!

23:33.513 --> 23:35.813
- What?
- They tried to kill me!
I brought her up to my room,

23:35.815 --> 23:37.548
and she pulled out a gun
and called her boyfriend.

23:37.550 --> 23:40.918
- He was robbing us.
- You get your heads down!

23:40.920 --> 23:43.154
The room's in my name.
My name's Statton Taylor.

23:43.156 --> 23:45.022
Of course it is.
And I'm the one being
held at gunpoint.

23:45.024 --> 23:47.525
- I'm Statton Taylor!
- No, he's not!

23:47.527 --> 23:48.793
- Shut the fuck up!
- Okay, okay, okay.

23:48.795 --> 23:50.494
Have you got any ID, sir?

23:50.496 --> 23:53.063
- Hey, that's my wallet!
- Shut it!

24:00.706 --> 24:04.208
- Any photo ID?
- Ah, Jesus. They're
the ones with the guns.

24:04.210 --> 24:07.812
- Whose ID do you think it is?
- It's mine! He stole
the wallet from me!

24:07.814 --> 24:10.781
Very slowly look up
towards the door.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.817
Sedgwick, manager.

24:12.819 --> 24:15.486
Which one of these men
is Statton Taylor?

24:17.523 --> 24:19.690
- That one.
- What?

24:19.692 --> 24:21.892
- I talked to him earlier.
- Mary: His name is Kipper.

24:21.894 --> 24:24.161
He went to the door.
He had us at gunpoint.

24:24.163 --> 24:26.964
You're the one with the guns.
He's the one that's wounded.

24:26.966 --> 24:31.135
- Twice. Wounded twice.
- We'll get you to the hospital,
Mr. Taylor.

24:31.137 --> 24:33.737
- We'll take a statement
in the morning.
- Thank you, officer.

24:33.739 --> 24:34.772
I thought they
were gonna kill me.

24:34.774 --> 24:37.641
We do our job, that's all.

24:37.643 --> 24:39.944
Sedgwick:
You do not have to
say anything,

24:39.946 --> 24:43.013
but it may harm your defense
if you don't mention
when questioned

24:43.015 --> 24:46.083
something you later
rely on in court.

24:46.085 --> 24:48.152
<i> ( music playing )</i>

25:08.841 --> 25:14.011
Fuck. Statton,
I think I've got a wrap
of coke in my pocket.

25:14.013 --> 25:16.514
What? Cocaine?

25:16.516 --> 25:18.949
Mm-hmm. Can you reach it?
It's in my jacket pocket.

25:18.951 --> 25:22.953
- But they searched you.
- There's a zip pocket
inside the pocket.

25:22.955 --> 25:28.092
- Just leave it there.
- No, no. They might have dogs
at the station.

25:28.094 --> 25:31.161
-<i> ( police radio chatter )</i>
- Why do you have cocaine
anyway? It's illegal.

25:31.163 --> 25:33.797
It's from a party
weeks ago.

25:33.799 --> 25:36.967
- Just get it.
- All right.

25:36.969 --> 25:38.269
God!

25:43.142 --> 25:44.875
I can't.

25:44.877 --> 25:47.878
- That is not my pocket.
- Sorry.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.880
I've got it,
I've got it, I've got it.

25:52.051 --> 25:53.717
Let's hand it in.

25:53.719 --> 25:56.954
No, no. Just drop it
when we get out of the van.

25:56.956 --> 26:00.691
No, you always go
to the authorities, that way
they never suspect you.

26:04.130 --> 26:06.263
- Officer?
- ( banging )

26:06.265 --> 26:09.266
- Officer, I found illegal drugs
in the back of your van.
- Statton, no, no, no.

26:43.603 --> 26:46.370
Not your first time then.

26:46.372 --> 26:49.106
- What?
- We've run a check on your
girlfriend's fingerprints.

26:49.108 --> 26:52.876
- She's not my girlfriend.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Your "lady friend."

26:52.878 --> 26:55.813
Her name is Yvonne Page,

26:55.815 --> 27:00.284
and she has a previous
for armed robbery.

27:00.286 --> 27:03.087
We're not saying anything
till our lawyer gets here.

27:03.089 --> 27:06.657
- Come back then.
- Oh, I will.

27:22.241 --> 27:24.675
Fucking sidekick.

27:25.411 --> 27:26.910
Fuck.

27:35.421 --> 27:38.155
Where's the leg
that needs fixing then?

27:40.226 --> 27:42.793
Your name's Yvonne?
Your name's not even Carol.

27:42.795 --> 27:44.795
You have previous convictions.

27:44.797 --> 27:46.430
Oh, that's it,
we're going down.

27:46.432 --> 27:48.766
Oh, calm down.
It's not like I planned this.

27:48.768 --> 27:50.934
If I did, I wouldn't
have a criminal record
now, would I?

27:50.936 --> 27:54.104
Still your fault.
You grabbed the gun.
You had the cocaine.

27:54.106 --> 27:56.140
Oh, my God,
I'm going down
for armed robbery.

27:56.142 --> 27:59.677
Oh, my giddy Christ,
why didn't you tell me
you'd already been arrested?

27:59.679 --> 28:02.246
- It was a long time ago. I--
- Well, how long ago?

28:02.248 --> 28:03.914
Was it before
or after the nunnery?

28:03.916 --> 28:07.317
It was actually the reason
I was asked to leave.

28:08.821 --> 28:11.822
You committed armed robbery
when you were a nun?

28:11.824 --> 28:13.824
I just drove the getaway car.

28:13.826 --> 28:15.959
No one thought they'd chase
the convent car.

28:15.961 --> 28:18.462
It had St. Lucy
of the Isle Convent
written all over it.

28:18.464 --> 28:20.097
You were a nun here
on the island?

28:20.099 --> 28:21.832
- Mm-hmm.
- I thought you were a tourist.

28:21.834 --> 28:23.333
I left the island years ago.

28:23.335 --> 28:25.703
I just come back
every now and again.

28:25.705 --> 28:27.938
To wreak havoc
and get people arrested.

28:27.940 --> 28:30.374
Look, you're making
too much of it.

28:30.376 --> 28:33.310
I got a suspended sentence,
I didn't do time.

28:33.312 --> 28:34.978
Who are you even
doing this with?

28:34.980 --> 28:37.114
- Errant nuns who needed--
- No.

28:37.116 --> 28:39.116
I fell in with a bad crowd.

28:39.118 --> 28:41.085
How? You were living
in a convent!

28:41.087 --> 28:44.321
They were a youth group.
Troubled teens.

28:44.323 --> 28:46.724
I was supposed to be
mentoring them,

28:46.726 --> 28:49.159
- but instead--
- Instead, you committed
armed robbery with them.

28:49.161 --> 28:52.229
Oh, they were fun,
and they offered to give me
some of the cash.

28:52.231 --> 28:55.399
You have no idea how hard
the vow of poverty is.

28:55.401 --> 29:01.772
- Fuck-a-fuck.
- Way worse than chastity
by far.

29:01.774 --> 29:03.774
<i> ( phone ringing )</i>

29:08.180 --> 29:10.214
Hello.
Statton Taylor speaking.

29:10.216 --> 29:14.284
- Kipper! What's going on?
- Oh, calm down, mum.

29:14.286 --> 29:17.154
I'm fine, I'm fine.
I'm in the hospital.

29:17.156 --> 29:20.290
- You're not in the nick?
-<i> No. No, no, no.</i>

29:20.292 --> 29:22.459
They caught the pair
that did it.

29:25.364 --> 29:28.899
Are you telling me
the two people that can ID us

29:28.901 --> 29:30.534
are in the fucking nick?

29:30.536 --> 29:32.302
That's right, mum.

29:42.381 --> 29:43.981
<i> You really stupid,</i>
<i> you know that?</i>

29:43.983 --> 29:47.050
I woke Petal up
and got her to put on

29:47.052 --> 29:49.219
a nurse's uniform
to instill confidence in you,

29:49.221 --> 29:51.555
and you're not
even fucking here!

29:51.557 --> 29:53.323
Look, someone with
a first aid certificate

29:53.325 --> 29:56.260
that you do weekly role-play
with is not a nurse.

29:58.063 --> 30:00.230
Mum.

30:00.232 --> 30:03.033
Just get yourself
out of the hospital
as soon as you can,

30:03.035 --> 30:05.536
before
the Bobbsey twins ID you.

30:07.940 --> 30:09.306
Love you, bye.

30:10.242 --> 30:11.408
Prick.

30:15.281 --> 30:16.580
We have to go, Petal.

30:16.582 --> 30:20.083
Shame to waste the bed.

30:20.085 --> 30:25.022
You could be done
in three minutes, Dec-ster.

30:32.932 --> 30:36.300
This can't be happening.
This can't be happening to me.

30:36.302 --> 30:39.169
- This is your fault!
- This is good for you.

30:39.171 --> 30:41.872
You needed
something like this.

30:54.253 --> 30:57.621
I don't want no trouble.
I just wanna go home.

30:57.623 --> 30:59.456
( sobbing )

30:59.458 --> 31:04.628
Seems to me
like you need a new start.

31:04.630 --> 31:07.297
Get your own place.

31:07.299 --> 31:09.132
That problem
seems to be solved.

31:09.134 --> 31:11.134
I'm about to get
a cell of my own.

31:11.136 --> 31:13.136
It'd be better than
what you have.

31:13.138 --> 31:15.138
You got no life.

31:15.140 --> 31:17.574
Don't judge me.
You can't judge me.

31:17.576 --> 31:21.011
I run my own business.
I tune pianos, which is a--

31:21.013 --> 31:22.946
Which is,
when you think about it,

31:22.948 --> 31:25.315
making something
someone else made
very slightly better.

31:25.317 --> 31:28.285
You don't make pianos.
You don't make music.

31:28.287 --> 31:32.356
What the-- I allow
other people to make music.

31:32.358 --> 31:36.026
Well, aren't you tired
of letting other people
make the music?

31:36.028 --> 31:39.663
When I started, there were
a thousand functioning pianos

31:39.665 --> 31:42.232
on this island,
and now there are 400.

31:42.234 --> 31:46.937
I'm not even
a failed musician anymore.
I'm a failed piano tuner.

31:48.340 --> 31:51.341
Except now
I'll be nothing,

31:51.343 --> 31:53.210
because I'll have
a criminal record.

31:53.212 --> 31:56.079
And what school or church
or community hall

31:56.081 --> 31:58.682
is gonna give me the run
of their place, eh?

31:58.684 --> 32:02.953
Because my life,
the one you say I don't have,

32:02.955 --> 32:04.421
will be over.

32:04.423 --> 32:07.190
You're acting like
we're guilty here.

32:07.192 --> 32:09.593
The whole thing
is kinda funny when
you think about it.

32:09.595 --> 32:12.195
The cops arresting us
while the guy was in the room?

32:12.197 --> 32:14.097
That wasn't remotely funny.

32:14.099 --> 32:16.066
And who gives a flying frick
if we're innocent

32:16.068 --> 32:17.434
if we can't prove it?

32:17.436 --> 32:20.704
Look, when our lawyer
gets here, he--

32:20.706 --> 32:23.974
he should be here.
What time is it?

32:23.976 --> 32:26.543
Well, I don't know, because
the very expensive watch

32:26.545 --> 32:28.145
that my wife bought me
has been stolen.

32:28.147 --> 32:30.080
It wasn't expensive.
It was a fake.

32:30.082 --> 32:32.382
My wife bought me that watch
from a very, very--

32:32.384 --> 32:34.685
Then your wife was ripped off.

32:34.687 --> 32:36.987
My dad was a jeweler.

32:36.989 --> 32:38.722
I spent
my childhood in Philly

32:38.724 --> 32:41.491
sitting in
the back of his shop
wearing a loupe.

32:41.493 --> 32:44.461
He called me Diamond Lil'.

32:44.463 --> 32:47.731
My watch might be fake,
but at least I'm not.

32:49.401 --> 32:50.701
What's that supposed to mean?

32:50.703 --> 32:55.238
Mary, Carol,
Yvonne-- whatever.

32:55.240 --> 32:57.607
Is there anything else
you want to tell me?

32:57.609 --> 32:59.409
I don't want
any more surprises.

32:59.411 --> 33:02.245
Well, one thing,

33:02.247 --> 33:05.382
but it's tiny,
not even worth mentioning.

33:05.384 --> 33:08.418
- What?
- It's nothing.

33:08.420 --> 33:10.587
I demand you tell me.

33:10.589 --> 33:13.557
Don't laugh at me.
This is my life!

33:13.559 --> 33:17.127
- It was a bar fight.
- You were in a bar fight.

33:17.129 --> 33:18.762
I was protecting a friend.

33:18.764 --> 33:21.431
Some guy was getting sleazy
with her in the strip club.

33:21.433 --> 33:24.001
What were you doing
in a strip club?

33:24.003 --> 33:26.336
Stripping.

33:30.009 --> 33:31.742
Right.

33:31.744 --> 33:34.578
Okay.

33:34.580 --> 33:36.113
Right.

33:36.115 --> 33:39.783
Was this before
or after the nunnery?

33:39.785 --> 33:42.152
After.

33:42.154 --> 33:45.288
I couldn't pay the bills,
couldn't go home.

33:45.290 --> 33:47.290
Did they know
you were a nun?

33:47.292 --> 33:49.292
That was my act.

33:49.294 --> 33:52.029
- What was?
- Stripping nun.

33:52.031 --> 33:56.666
My character was called
Our Lady Of The Night.

34:07.813 --> 34:09.780
You don't have to stay here
all night, you know.

34:09.782 --> 34:14.184
- Not on my account.
- Don't worry, mate.

34:14.186 --> 34:17.287
Better in here
than it is out there,
I can assure you.

34:17.289 --> 34:19.589
Don't want to stretch
your legs or anything?

34:19.591 --> 34:23.493
Oh, thanks.
I'm meant to be here,

34:23.495 --> 34:27.230
just until they've taken
your statement in the morning

34:27.232 --> 34:29.733
and checked your ID.
Just formalities.

34:31.837 --> 34:36.373
Well, I feel really reassured
that you're gonna be here,

34:36.375 --> 34:37.774
Officer...

34:37.776 --> 34:41.411
- Uh, Dean.
- Dean.

34:44.349 --> 34:46.583
After all I've been through.

34:54.660 --> 34:57.527
Well, I've, um--

34:57.529 --> 35:01.698
I've gone and got myself
an errant nine on the top line.

35:01.700 --> 35:03.767
Are you any good
at "Suduku"?

35:07.372 --> 35:09.172
( Japanese accent )
Sudoku.

35:09.174 --> 35:10.607
( chuckles )

35:15.714 --> 35:17.714
Do you know,
I'll have a go at this
for you, officer,

35:17.716 --> 35:23.386
if you could get me
a little chocolate biscuit
or something?

35:23.388 --> 35:26.556
Hot drink? Anything?

35:26.558 --> 35:30.460
Call me Luke, now that
we're sharing a "Sudoku."

35:33.265 --> 35:35.465
- ( muttering )
- Yeah, a crisp.

35:47.479 --> 35:49.579
You might not care,
but I have things I need
to get back for.

35:49.581 --> 35:51.281
Oh, really? Do you, Statton?

35:51.283 --> 35:52.816
You sleep on
your wife's sofa bed.

35:52.818 --> 35:54.584
What were your
big plans tonight,

35:54.586 --> 35:56.353
to go home
and jerk off and cry?

35:56.355 --> 35:59.589
- Jerk off and cry?
- Jerk off and cry.

35:59.591 --> 36:02.259
- Fuck off and die.
- Oh, come on!

36:02.261 --> 36:04.761
Isn't a part of you
enjoying that something's
happening to you?

36:04.763 --> 36:06.930
- No!
- Wouldn't you like
to have one story

36:06.932 --> 36:09.232
that didn't end with,
"And there was a cat

36:09.234 --> 36:10.734
trapped in my piano
all along?"

36:10.736 --> 36:12.936
You loved that story!
You laughed at that story--

36:12.938 --> 36:15.205
that story got you
into my bed!

36:15.207 --> 36:18.742
That story made me realize
that you needed to get laid.

36:20.312 --> 36:22.612
And you know what else?

36:22.614 --> 36:24.781
At the hotel,

36:24.783 --> 36:29.619
I left the door
unlocked deliberately

36:29.621 --> 36:33.623
because
it's more exciting that way.

36:33.625 --> 36:37.394
You fucked up nun!
You fucked up fucking nun!

36:40.299 --> 36:43.466
Mm-hmm.
Yup, yup, yup.

36:43.468 --> 36:44.734
Well, this seems
to be the room,

36:44.736 --> 36:47.337
that makes you
the clients.

36:47.339 --> 36:48.939
Are you our lawyer?

36:48.941 --> 36:51.808
- Yeah. Yup.
- Can I get some ice please?

36:51.810 --> 36:56.346
I doubt it. No.
The facilities here
are surprisingly two-star.

36:56.348 --> 36:58.481
- I'm really hurt.
- No shit.

36:58.483 --> 37:00.217
So, tell me
how innocent you are.

37:00.219 --> 37:02.385
How the cops
have got it all wrong.

37:02.387 --> 37:03.520
They have got it all wrong.

37:03.522 --> 37:05.655
Okay, Yvonne,
I'm listening.

37:05.657 --> 37:07.357
I prefer Carol.

37:07.359 --> 37:08.992
Or Mary or countless
other names.

37:08.994 --> 37:10.493
Always reassures the court
if you have a number

37:10.495 --> 37:11.628
of functional pseudonyms.

37:11.630 --> 37:13.263
Yvonne will do.

37:13.265 --> 37:15.665
Yeah. Yup, yup, yup.

37:15.667 --> 37:18.835
Well, I'm Rich.
Uh, name only.

37:18.837 --> 37:20.670
Obviously,
not literally rich

37:20.672 --> 37:22.539
or I'd be drunk
this time of night.

37:22.541 --> 37:25.375
Look, these guys,
they stole my watch,
they stole my identity.

37:25.377 --> 37:28.011
Yup, yup, yup.
Well, I think I have enough.

37:28.013 --> 37:29.813
- You don't have a enough.
- They held us and gunpoint.

37:29.815 --> 37:31.281
I have enough
to get you bail.

37:31.283 --> 37:32.916
But you don't need bail
in the UK.

37:32.918 --> 37:34.484
This is not the UK.

37:34.486 --> 37:36.686
It's an island
Crown dependency.

37:36.688 --> 37:38.788
You can get to
the mainland on a rowboat.

37:38.790 --> 37:42.759
You need bail.
So, who do I call?

37:42.761 --> 37:45.028
- I don't know.
- No one springs to mind.

37:45.030 --> 37:46.296
Me neither.

37:48.700 --> 37:49.899
Okay.

37:52.404 --> 37:55.905
Tell me a very,
very interesting story.

37:58.877 --> 38:01.544
Hello, Danno.
Look, I'm sorry it's so late.

38:01.546 --> 38:03.713
Uh, it's Statton.

38:03.715 --> 38:06.549
Yeah, right back to you.
Yeah, fine, fine.

38:06.551 --> 38:09.886
How are you?
Uh, look, sorry, mate,
I need to get to the point.

38:09.888 --> 38:13.056
Do you remember a guy
called Kipper from your party?

38:13.058 --> 38:15.725
Yeah, do you know
his surname?

38:15.727 --> 38:20.063
- Oh, no, he doesn't know.
- Give me that.

38:20.065 --> 38:23.733
Danno, are you Catholic?

38:23.735 --> 38:25.902
Well, I'm a virgin
motherfucking nun

38:25.904 --> 38:28.305
and I need you to
reach back down there

38:28.307 --> 38:31.574
into you subconscious
and figure the fuck out
what Kipper's last name is

38:31.576 --> 38:34.744
or I'll personally see to it
that you're stuck in Purgatory

38:34.746 --> 38:37.914
for the duration of your
natural born death!

38:37.916 --> 38:39.582
Whew! Oof.

38:39.584 --> 38:40.750
Yup.

38:43.522 --> 38:45.555
Motherfucker.

38:46.792 --> 38:49.926
( all inhale )

38:49.928 --> 38:52.462
Get the hospital
on the phone now.

38:52.464 --> 38:54.364
Right. What was
his sidekick's name?

38:54.366 --> 38:57.967
I don't remember.
I'm not very good
with names.

38:59.471 --> 39:01.838
They did say.
I did a mnemonic.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.073
You used my mnemonics?

39:03.075 --> 39:05.108
I pictured the Titanic.

39:05.110 --> 39:06.876
Rearranging deck chairs
on the Titanic.

39:06.878 --> 39:08.511
His name is Deck Chair!

39:08.513 --> 39:09.646
Dec. Short for Declan.

39:09.648 --> 39:10.647
Dec, Dec.
His name's Dec.

39:10.649 --> 39:11.915
Uh...

39:13.618 --> 39:16.519
Yeah, Kipper's gone.

39:16.521 --> 39:18.621
He walked out
of the hospital

39:18.623 --> 39:22.025
when Officer Dean
went to get him
a chocolate bickie.

39:23.962 --> 39:25.628
Go and make up
a better story

39:25.630 --> 39:27.797
of how this criminal
got away.

39:27.799 --> 39:30.133
Ideally, one that doesn't
make me look like a prick

39:30.135 --> 39:32.435
for allowing the two
of you out of the station.

39:34.806 --> 39:36.673
Go.

39:39.511 --> 39:42.779
- Could we go?
- You're still charged with
possession of cocaine.

39:42.781 --> 39:45.648
I think under
the circumstances, Sergeant,

39:45.650 --> 39:47.650
all charges
should be dropped.

39:47.652 --> 39:49.919
Do you?
Sadly, I disagree.

39:49.921 --> 39:54.524
Officer,
the drugs were mine.

39:54.526 --> 39:56.826
Statton had nothing
to do with it.

39:56.828 --> 39:58.528
Well, he was holding them,

39:58.530 --> 40:00.029
which means
you're both in possession

40:00.031 --> 40:02.665
with conspiracy to pervert
the course of justice.

40:02.667 --> 40:06.403
Your bail just doubled,
you numpties!

40:23.555 --> 40:26.790
Dec, I am out. I'm out.

40:26.792 --> 40:30.560
Oh, good. They'll be out
sooner or later, too.

40:30.562 --> 40:31.828
We got to get rid of them.

40:31.830 --> 40:33.463
No, no, no, no,
it's too late.

40:33.465 --> 40:34.664
Too late,
they'll definitely

40:34.666 --> 40:35.865
have talked by now,
definitely.

40:35.867 --> 40:37.033
Yeah, but you can't
have a trial

40:37.035 --> 40:39.035
without witnesses,
can you, buddy?

40:39.037 --> 40:42.906
<i> I told you, right,</i>
<i> not to go into a room</i>

40:42.908 --> 40:45.041
where people
were still awake.

40:45.043 --> 40:47.043
I told you
it was reckless.

40:47.045 --> 40:48.478
But you didn't listen.

40:48.480 --> 40:50.046
It was just meant to be
a bit of fun.

40:50.048 --> 40:51.681
Something funny
to tell the boys.

40:51.683 --> 40:53.583
Yeah, well, I'll tell you
what is funny, okay?

40:53.585 --> 40:55.585
I gotta lay low, Dec? Okay?
The cops are after me

40:55.587 --> 40:57.053
and they don't know
what you look like!

40:57.055 --> 41:01.224
Does your kid know
what you look like?

41:01.226 --> 41:03.092
Because at this rate,
he'll be identifying

41:03.094 --> 41:06.229
your dead body
in the morgue, mate.

41:15.140 --> 41:18.074
Hello, Denise,
I'm sorry to wake you.

41:18.076 --> 41:22.912
Um, I'm in the police station.

41:22.914 --> 41:24.247
I really don't want to ask,

41:24.249 --> 41:30.920
but, uh, could you, um,
bail me out?

41:30.922 --> 41:33.890
And my friend?

41:35.694 --> 41:38.661
- Denise, thanks. Look--
- This your friend?

41:38.663 --> 41:40.630
Yeah.

41:40.632 --> 41:42.565
Can I have a word
with you please?

41:42.567 --> 41:45.168
Um, sure.

42:00.118 --> 42:04.621
Okay, I'll bail you out,
but you got take him.

42:04.623 --> 42:07.290
- What?
- He can't come back to me.

42:07.292 --> 42:08.791
Look, I don't know
what you think this is--

42:08.793 --> 42:10.927
We broke up a year ago--

42:10.929 --> 42:13.563
sorry,
I don't know your name.

42:14.966 --> 42:16.799
Call me Carol.

42:16.801 --> 42:20.136
Carol, please,
we broke up a year ago.

42:20.138 --> 42:22.605
- Got a divorce.
- Well, he said separated.

42:22.607 --> 42:26.709
He always says that.
We signed divorce papers.

42:26.711 --> 42:29.679
He said he was gonna
get his own place,

42:29.681 --> 42:30.813
he was just staying
on the sofa bed

42:30.815 --> 42:32.315
- for a couple of weeks.
- Yeah.

42:32.317 --> 42:34.817
Well, I've started
seeing someone else.

42:34.819 --> 42:37.086
Six months went by,
new guy wants to move in.

42:37.088 --> 42:39.822
- Oh, I see.
- Do you know, tonight
is the first night

42:39.824 --> 42:41.858
that he stayed out
after 10:00?

42:41.860 --> 42:47.830
I was so hopeful.
I thought, "This is it.

42:47.832 --> 42:50.833
He's met someone.
He's gonna go!"

42:50.835 --> 42:52.835
I think it's more
of a one-night kinda--

42:52.837 --> 42:54.837
No. No, it can't be.

42:54.839 --> 42:57.707
I'll pay you to be
his transitional girl.

42:57.709 --> 42:58.942
I mean, I'll bail you out.

42:58.944 --> 43:00.610
Well, can't you just
ask him to leave?

43:00.612 --> 43:06.049
I've tried to!
He just keeps not leaving.

43:06.051 --> 43:09.852
I have come home
furious as fuck,

43:09.854 --> 43:12.188
ready to throw him out,
change the locks,

43:12.190 --> 43:14.724
and he's just...

43:14.726 --> 43:16.192
he's cooked a risotto,

43:16.194 --> 43:19.329
changed my light bulbs.

43:19.331 --> 43:21.364
He's just not
the sort of guy

43:21.366 --> 43:25.201
who you can throw out.

43:25.203 --> 43:28.037
But now, now!
This is his own fault,
you know.

43:28.039 --> 43:30.873
I can do this now.
It might be my last shot.

43:30.875 --> 43:34.043
- I don't know.
- Skip bail if you want.

43:34.045 --> 43:35.378
Get the ferry
to the mainland.

43:35.380 --> 43:37.347
I don't care,
just take him with you.

43:37.349 --> 43:40.116
I beg you.

43:47.359 --> 43:50.393
Do you take plastic?

43:51.763 --> 43:53.229
You're throwing me out?

43:53.231 --> 43:56.399
No, you're leaving me
for her.

43:56.401 --> 43:57.900
But I need to come home.
I just got robbed.

43:57.902 --> 44:00.403
I haven't got any money.

44:00.405 --> 44:02.071
All right, you can have
what I've got in my purse,

44:02.073 --> 44:03.773
then call the bank tomorrow.

44:03.775 --> 44:07.076
You're in luck. Here's 100.
Good luck, Statton.

44:07.078 --> 44:09.912
- What about my stuff, my--
- I'll send it on.

44:13.251 --> 44:16.052
Where to?

44:16.053 --> 44:18.854
Babe, ask Carol, huh?
You live with her now.

44:27.932 --> 44:30.099
We made a deal.

44:30.101 --> 44:33.202
<i> ( music playing )</i>

44:36.107 --> 44:39.942
Statton! Statton, wait.

44:39.944 --> 44:41.444
Wait.

44:41.446 --> 44:43.346
Statton, Statton.

44:43.348 --> 44:46.449
Wait! Come on!

44:46.451 --> 44:48.818
I can't believe you did
a deal for me.

44:48.820 --> 44:52.121
- I'm not property.
- I didn't have much choice,

44:52.123 --> 44:53.823
and she seemed
kind of desperate.

44:53.825 --> 44:56.459
- I'm not living with you.
- Oh, really?

44:56.461 --> 45:00.229
But I thought we were gonna
register for twin babies
and matching china.

45:00.231 --> 45:03.466
I hate you, I hate you!
You're a curse of a woman.

45:03.468 --> 45:05.201
Why are you even here?

45:15.847 --> 45:17.780
( scoffs )

45:17.782 --> 45:20.349
Let me give you
some cash, okay?

45:20.351 --> 45:22.085
I don't want to
leave you stranded.

45:22.087 --> 45:24.854
I know how hard
the vow of poverty is.

45:24.856 --> 45:26.155
Okay.

45:26.157 --> 45:29.158
- Look.
- Thanks.

45:29.160 --> 45:32.495
Well, you want me
to buy you a drink
or not?

45:32.497 --> 45:34.330
You're going drinking now?

45:34.332 --> 45:37.166
No, I'm gonna find out
where my pendant is.

45:37.168 --> 45:39.001
- Why?
- It doesn't matter.

45:39.003 --> 45:41.003
Well, exactly!
So, leave it!

45:41.005 --> 45:43.339
My birth mother left it
at the hospital for me.

45:43.341 --> 45:45.408
- What?
- I'm adopted.

45:47.879 --> 45:49.345
Well, I didn't know.

45:49.347 --> 45:52.181
I didn't either,
until I did.

45:52.183 --> 45:54.517
And, well, she left it
for me when I was born

45:54.519 --> 45:58.888
and I've never taken it off
since I've had it.

45:58.890 --> 46:01.357
- Not before tonight.
- Oh.

46:01.359 --> 46:03.359
And I know you think
it's just stupid

46:03.361 --> 46:05.027
or just a thing
or whatever,
but you know what?

46:05.029 --> 46:06.362
I don't care
what you think.

46:06.364 --> 46:10.032
I'm getting
my necklace back.

46:10.034 --> 46:12.201
And you might
as well come with me,

46:12.203 --> 46:13.970
you have nowhere
else to go.

46:16.207 --> 46:19.976
And I bet who ever
it's been hawked to
is in the streets.

It's Bollocks McGiven!

46:42.066 --> 46:44.934
- All: Bollocks!
- Bollocks McGiven?

46:44.936 --> 46:47.236
Oh, a long story
involving a night in Dublin,

46:47.238 --> 46:50.072
a poker game,
and a frying pan.

46:50.074 --> 46:54.243
Oh, Bollocks!
The unit's broken down again.

46:54.245 --> 46:55.912
Would you mind coming by
and having a look?

46:55.914 --> 46:59.382
Sure, it's probably
the throttle
body cleaner again.

46:59.384 --> 47:01.317
Oh, you're adorable!

47:01.319 --> 47:05.822
Hey. You wanna Brexit?
Go back to my place?

47:05.824 --> 47:08.958
- Oh, not tonight.
- Aww.

47:08.960 --> 47:11.961
Do you know where
I can score in here?

47:11.963 --> 47:15.498
Oh.

47:15.500 --> 47:18.367
Sorry, kid, you need cash.

47:18.369 --> 47:20.570
I don't give credit
to customers I don't know.

47:20.572 --> 47:24.540
I swear I'm good for it.
I was robbed tonight!

47:24.542 --> 47:26.442
There were these guys
with guns--

All right! All right!

47:28.279 --> 47:30.513
Save your stories

47:37.288 --> 47:41.023
Hey! Did you used to do
a stripping nun act?

47:43.628 --> 47:46.295
No. Must have been
someone else.

Statton:
What the fuck?

If you talk to a drug dealer
without buying drugs,

47:59.477 --> 48:01.644
they start to get suspicious,
and he's the guy

48:01.646 --> 48:03.646
who'll know
who's got my pendant.

48:03.648 --> 48:06.482
In a half hour,
that guy will be my BF and F,

48:06.484 --> 48:08.417
and 'effing tell me
everything I need to know.

48:08.419 --> 48:10.319
Just get rid of it.

48:10.321 --> 48:12.154
Mmm.

48:12.156 --> 48:14.523
I was hoping you would.

48:14.525 --> 48:18.027
There's absolutely
no point in doing
hard time for holding

48:18.029 --> 48:19.362
if you're not gonna
have any fun.

48:19.364 --> 48:21.664
I mean, that's just--
that's just embarrassing.

48:21.666 --> 48:24.934
I just don't drink and drug.

48:28.172 --> 48:30.039
You've never done it
before, have you?

48:30.041 --> 48:32.408
What? Yeah...

48:36.514 --> 48:39.015
And I kicked the gun
out of his hand, right?

48:39.017 --> 48:41.117
It flew up in the air
and I caught it, and I put it
to his head, and was like,

48:41.119 --> 48:42.652
"Don't move, motherfucker,
or I'll blow your head off."

48:42.654 --> 48:44.353
And then police, they've
surrounded the building.

48:44.355 --> 48:45.955
They're like,
"Come out with
your hands up."

48:45.957 --> 48:47.456
And I was like,
"Don't worry, lads,
I got this."

49:30.568 --> 49:32.234
- ( knocking on door )
- Kitty: Bollocks!

49:32.236 --> 49:34.303
I'm busting like
the six dams out here!

49:34.305 --> 49:37.640
And if you've got any drugs,
I'd love some.

49:39.110 --> 49:40.743
I'll be right out, Kitty.

it was either him or me.

And he's just
an innocent guy, you know?

49:50.154 --> 49:52.121
He's probably got a family.
I don't want him to die.

The strangest thing is,
I don't even know karate,

49:54.459 --> 49:56.425
but I jumped off the bed,
knocked him to the floor,

49:56.427 --> 49:57.426

our heads.

50:07.438 --> 50:10.773
¶ 'Cause I wanna
fight for love ¶

50:10.775 --> 50:12.241
<i> ¶ If you call out my name ¶</i>

50:12.243 --> 50:16.445
So, if I wanted to
get rid of some jewelry,

50:16.447 --> 50:20.616
something I borrowed,
who'd be interested?

50:20.618 --> 50:22.785
You tried eBay?

50:22.787 --> 50:25.287
I know that guy.

50:25.289 --> 50:29.158
Yeah, I helped
that guy get a cat
out of a piano once.

50:29.160 --> 50:32.628
- What?
- I'm a vet.

50:32.630 --> 50:34.597
You get called in
to do the craziest shit.

50:34.599 --> 50:36.165
Theo loves that story,
don't you, Theo?

50:36.167 --> 50:38.100
Victor, you've given away
the punchline now.

50:38.102 --> 50:41.170
- ( dog barking )
- Hey, Buddy!
It's all right, Asbo.

50:41.172 --> 50:42.371
Victor:
Dec wants you
to call him, back.

50:42.373 --> 50:44.640
He says it's urgent.

50:44.642 --> 50:47.676
Tell him we've found
what he's looking for.

50:53.651 --> 50:56.719
- I gotta go.
- Wait, you haven't heard
the story yet.

50:59.323 --> 51:00.389
Tell her the story.

51:02.560 --> 51:06.729
<i> ¶ 'Cause I'm gonna fight</i>
<i> for love ¶</i>

51:08.232 --> 51:10.366
( no audible dialogue )

51:13.204 --> 51:17.573
<i> ( electric guitar</i>
<i> warming up )</i>

51:21.679 --> 51:25.581
<i> ( rock music playing )</i>

51:28.553 --> 51:30.719
Motherfucker!

51:33.691 --> 51:35.191
( screaming )

51:39.764 --> 51:41.497
No, no, no, no.
I attacked him in front

51:41.499 --> 51:43.532
of a police officer
completely unprovoked.

51:43.534 --> 51:45.334
- I have to plead guilty.
- You never have to
plead guilty.

51:45.336 --> 51:46.869
I want to plead guilty.

51:46.871 --> 51:49.238
It was the greatest moment
of my life.

51:49.240 --> 51:50.539
I don't want to deny it.

51:50.541 --> 51:53.542
Hey, guilty makes
my life easy.

51:53.544 --> 51:56.145
And the police are
looking for Mary, right?

51:56.147 --> 51:58.714
Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

51:58.716 --> 52:01.383
If you want my advice,
as a legal professional,

52:01.385 --> 52:03.152
don't worry about her.

52:03.154 --> 52:05.221
She's a very
capable lady, mm-hmm. Eh?

52:07.758 --> 52:11.260
So, how long
are we gonna wait here?

52:11.262 --> 52:14.163
Until Kipper calls us back
and decides what
to do with you.

52:21.405 --> 52:23.572
We shouldn't have left
Asbo at the bar.

52:23.574 --> 52:25.174
Well, there's a new scent
in the car, man.

52:25.176 --> 52:27.143
Do you want him barking,
drawing attention?

52:27.145 --> 52:30.146
Theo: He doesn't like
being tied up, though.
You know that.

52:30.148 --> 52:32.648
- He's a dog, man!
- Yeah, but dogs have feelings.

52:47.598 --> 52:48.898
Hmm.

52:51.369 --> 52:53.836
( chewing loudly )

52:56.307 --> 52:57.640
Can I have some gum?

53:04.615 --> 53:05.681
Thanks.

53:15.459 --> 53:19.461
So what's it like,
being a dealer?

53:19.463 --> 53:22.965
- It's a living.
- It's not like being
a shopkeeper then?

53:22.967 --> 53:26.635
Did Kipper say that?
Is he still going on
about that?

53:26.637 --> 53:29.805
I've told him before,
it's a dangerous game.

53:29.807 --> 53:31.974
It's not like running
a Tesco Metro!

53:31.976 --> 53:34.810
- Jesus Christ!
- Well, he didn't
say that exactly.

53:34.812 --> 53:36.245
Oh, yes, he did.
I know him.

53:36.247 --> 53:37.646
Don't let her wind you up.

53:37.648 --> 53:40.816
I'm sorry.
I should have said anything.

53:40.818 --> 53:44.253
I'm just thinking of
a career change, that's all.

53:46.657 --> 53:49.491
Can you really buy a degree?

53:49.493 --> 53:52.828
I didn't
buy a degree, right?
I did a course.

53:52.830 --> 53:55.998
On the Internet.
Distance learning
is the future.

53:56.000 --> 53:59.368
That's what I told Kipper,
and he said an Internet degree

53:59.370 --> 54:01.670
is not worth the email
it's attached to.

54:01.672 --> 54:04.506
- Fucking Kipper!
- You know, you guys
shouldn't worry

54:04.508 --> 54:07.009
about anything that guy says.

54:07.011 --> 54:09.511
He got shot
in the leg tonight--

54:09.513 --> 54:12.014
twice--
trying to rob a hotel.

54:12.016 --> 54:15.684
I mean, who does
he think he is, Al Capone?

54:15.686 --> 54:17.686
Oh, he's a fucking amateur.

54:17.688 --> 54:19.688
And "Kipper"?
What's with that name?

54:19.690 --> 54:21.857
It's a nickname.
Do you wanna know
how he got it?

54:21.859 --> 54:24.693
Oh, my God, so much.
Is it embarrassing?

54:24.695 --> 54:26.629
Oh, you have no idea.

54:44.048 --> 54:46.315
( burps )

54:56.060 --> 54:59.561
Dec wants you dead, kid.
He won't do 20 years.

54:59.563 --> 55:02.064
So, get on the first ferry
to the mainland
in the morning, okay?

55:02.066 --> 55:05.567
Okay, I will. Thanks, guys.

55:05.569 --> 55:09.071
And if you are gonna
make those Welsh cakes,
don't forget...

55:09.073 --> 55:12.441
- grease the griddle pan--
- With lard!

55:12.443 --> 55:13.976
Oh, come here.

55:21.752 --> 55:24.586
And by the way, it was me

55:24.588 --> 55:26.422
who did the stripping nun act.

55:26.424 --> 55:28.924
I knew it!

55:38.769 --> 55:42.771
- Well, look who's
in trouble again.
- Mary!

55:42.773 --> 55:45.074
Oh, thank God.
I was so worried.

55:45.076 --> 55:49.912
- What are you doing here?
- Someone had to bail you out.

55:49.914 --> 55:54.016
- You don't have any money.
- Will you take plastic?

55:58.789 --> 56:02.624
Thank you, Reverend Mother.
I really appreciate this.

56:02.626 --> 56:04.626
Don't thank me,
thank Father Donald.

56:04.628 --> 56:09.031
- It's his credit card.
- He always had a crush on me.

56:12.636 --> 56:15.971
Father Donald better get
every penny of this back,

56:15.973 --> 56:19.842
- and some reward points.
- ( laughs )

56:23.414 --> 56:28.650
- Where are you taking me?
- Please, just follow me, okay?

56:28.652 --> 56:32.821
We should find
somewhere to hide
until the first ferry.

56:32.823 --> 56:36.992
I am getting off
this God forsaken island
and never coming back.

56:36.994 --> 56:39.995
Well, I can't leave, can I?
Where would I go?

56:39.997 --> 56:42.931
Um, somewhere where
no one wants to kill you?

56:42.933 --> 56:48.537
- I don't have--
- Statton, when was
the last time

56:48.539 --> 56:50.005
you went to the mainland?

56:50.007 --> 56:54.843
Uh, probably my stag night?

56:54.845 --> 56:57.179
I don't remember much
of that, to be honest.

56:57.181 --> 57:02.184
- And how long ago was that?
- Uh, eight years ago.

57:02.186 --> 57:05.687
Eight years?
Wait, you haven't been
off this tiny island

57:05.689 --> 57:06.755
in eight years?

57:08.025 --> 57:09.558
I haven't really
had the time.

57:09.560 --> 57:11.727
Yes, you have.

57:11.729 --> 57:13.896
When was the last time
you lived somewhere else?

57:13.898 --> 57:16.932
Did you go away
to college or...

57:19.570 --> 57:22.204
You've never lived
anywhere else but here?

57:22.206 --> 57:24.039
All right, that's it, buddy.

57:24.041 --> 57:26.575
We are getting off
this island if we have
to swim for it.

57:26.577 --> 57:28.043
No, no, no, no.
Wait, please.

57:28.045 --> 57:31.947
Just... it's a surprise.

57:34.585 --> 57:36.585
All in all,
I'd say I'm very good

57:36.587 --> 57:39.488
- for surprises this evening.
- One more?

57:40.591 --> 57:42.891
Okay.

57:55.906 --> 57:59.975
( bells tolling )

58:03.614 --> 58:05.247
The convent?

58:05.249 --> 58:08.517
Just wait in the chapel.
I'll be back.

58:23.934 --> 58:27.269
Hi, sorry to bother you.
My name's Statton.

58:27.271 --> 58:30.205
Um, I actually went
to Sunday school here.

58:30.207 --> 58:32.274
Um, that's irrelevant.

58:32.276 --> 58:36.945
Um, I'm a friend--
an acquaintance of Dec...lan?

58:36.947 --> 58:38.914
Don't know no Declan.

58:38.916 --> 58:41.884
Scottish?
Very-- quite angry.

58:41.886 --> 58:44.653
He said you might have
a necklace.

58:44.655 --> 58:46.221
Don't know
about no necklace.

58:46.223 --> 58:50.526
- And the pendant or...
- Eh.

58:50.528 --> 58:53.195
Are you sure?
'Cause, I mean,
he was quite adamant.

58:53.197 --> 58:56.798
All right, all right.

58:56.800 --> 58:58.867
I had it, but I haven't
got it anymore.

58:58.869 --> 59:03.305
Oh. Where is it?

59:03.307 --> 59:06.008
Give me a minute.
I'll call the guy
and get it back to you.

59:06.010 --> 59:07.743
Oh, thank you very much.

59:07.745 --> 59:10.312
It'll cost you.
500 at least.

59:10.314 --> 59:14.016
- Sure.
- Wait in the chapel.

59:14.985 --> 59:16.685
Are you online?

59:16.687 --> 59:18.921
I could do
a bank transfer, you see?

59:41.345 --> 59:43.779
Who's that?

59:43.781 --> 59:47.849
- Saint Tropez.
- Oh, yeah.

59:47.851 --> 59:49.851
Patron saint of suntans.

59:49.853 --> 59:52.854
Heh. Suntans?

59:52.856 --> 59:56.291
Okay, but it is Saint Tropez.

59:56.293 --> 1:00:00.028
He was decapitated by Nero,

1:00:00.030 --> 1:00:03.966
who set him adrift in a boat
with a rooster and a dog.

1:00:03.968 --> 1:00:06.668
Rougher night than ours.

1:00:06.670 --> 1:00:11.873
So, what's all the mystery?
What's the big surprise?

1:00:11.875 --> 1:00:14.209
Have you resubmitted
my application to the convent?

1:00:14.211 --> 1:00:17.012
'Cause I really don't think
they're gonna reconsider.

1:00:17.014 --> 1:00:21.083
Just... wait and see.

1:00:24.221 --> 1:00:26.388
Kipper, they're here.

1:00:26.390 --> 1:00:27.956
I don't know how long
I can hold them.

1:00:31.061 --> 1:00:34.229
Okay, confess something.

1:00:34.231 --> 1:00:38.233
Um, if a customer upsets me

1:00:38.235 --> 1:00:43.405
sometimes I make
their D slightly sharp.

1:00:43.407 --> 1:00:47.109
- True.
- True.

1:00:47.111 --> 1:00:52.114
I had an affair with
my math teacher's wife.

1:00:52.116 --> 1:00:56.652
- That's gotta be false.
- True.

1:00:56.654 --> 1:00:59.354
Sometimes when
I run out of underwear,

1:00:59.356 --> 1:01:02.257
I'd borrow
my wife's boyfriend's.

1:01:02.259 --> 1:01:05.827
- Um, true.
- True.

1:01:05.829 --> 1:01:08.096
When I was a nun,

1:01:08.098 --> 1:01:10.098
I was in a death metal band

1:01:10.100 --> 1:01:12.200
called "Clitty Slickers."

1:01:12.202 --> 1:01:14.369
True. Definitely true.

1:01:14.371 --> 1:01:18.807
- False.
- I wasn't sure you were
telling the truth

1:01:18.809 --> 1:01:22.844
about being a nun until
Mother Superior turned up.

1:01:22.846 --> 1:01:25.113
Okay.

1:01:25.115 --> 1:01:26.815
Well, I didn't believe
for one minute

1:01:26.817 --> 1:01:28.884
you were really
separated from your wife.

1:01:33.190 --> 1:01:36.058
What was your worst
relationship?

1:01:36.060 --> 1:01:38.827
Uh...

1:01:38.829 --> 1:01:41.129
- My wife.
- Hmm.

1:01:41.131 --> 1:01:44.032
- And your best?
- My wife.

1:01:47.738 --> 1:01:52.240
You know what?
I think this is better.

1:01:52.242 --> 1:01:54.342
Then it must have
been really bad.

1:01:54.344 --> 1:01:58.914
It lacked, uh... romance.

1:02:14.965 --> 1:02:16.898
Statton:
We're gonna get it back.

1:02:16.900 --> 1:02:19.000
You don't know that.

1:02:19.002 --> 1:02:20.368
Mmm. That's why we're here.

1:02:20.370 --> 1:02:23.872
- What?
- Father Donald's got it.

1:02:23.874 --> 1:02:25.874
Well, he had it.
He's getting it back.

1:02:25.876 --> 1:02:28.210
How did you find this out?

1:02:28.212 --> 1:02:30.746
Dec told me
in the police station.

1:02:30.748 --> 1:02:33.181
Dec told you?

1:02:33.183 --> 1:02:34.883
And why do you think
he'd do that, Statton?

1:02:34.885 --> 1:02:39.054
Because I paid him.

1:02:39.056 --> 1:02:43.358
You paid him? You paid him.

1:02:43.360 --> 1:02:46.027
What kind of fuckwittery
did they teach you

1:02:46.029 --> 1:02:47.896
in piano tuning school?

1:02:47.898 --> 1:02:50.365
Dec wants us dead,
and you just paid him

1:02:50.367 --> 1:02:53.535
to tell us where to go
so he could have us killed.

1:02:53.537 --> 1:02:56.238
Father Donald is a priest.
We can trust him.

1:02:56.240 --> 1:03:00.909
Dodgy Donald?
He's receiving stolen goods.
Think it through!

1:03:00.911 --> 1:03:04.513
He's a priest
that could afford
to bail us out.

1:03:04.515 --> 1:03:06.114
Come on, we gotta
get out of here.

1:03:09.219 --> 1:03:11.119
Fuck, I knew it!

1:03:12.055 --> 1:03:13.388
Sorry, Mary,
I thought that--

1:03:13.390 --> 1:03:15.423
Well, start thinking
of a way out.

1:03:15.425 --> 1:03:18.560
Sure, uh, um...

1:03:18.562 --> 1:03:21.396
- Windows!
- These windows are lead lined

1:03:21.398 --> 1:03:23.498
and too high
to climb out of anyway.

1:03:23.500 --> 1:03:26.368
No, no, we need to
attract attention.

1:03:26.370 --> 1:03:28.303
Uh...

1:03:39.583 --> 1:03:43.852
( playing
"House of Rising Sun" )

1:04:01.438 --> 1:04:04.339
Get up. Move.

1:04:06.610 --> 1:04:09.277
We've already been
to the police, Kipper.

1:04:09.279 --> 1:04:10.879
There's no point.

1:04:10.881 --> 1:04:13.315
Mary:
No point going down
for murder.

1:04:13.317 --> 1:04:15.617
It's only armed robbery.
No one got hurt.

1:04:15.619 --> 1:04:19.454
Dec says
if he gets armed robbery,
he goes down for twenty.

1:04:19.456 --> 1:04:23.158
Dec gets 20, I get dead,
kids-- no dad. Hmm?

1:04:23.160 --> 1:04:25.260
We'll refuse to testify.

1:04:27.464 --> 1:04:30.632
Dec's not the sort of guy
you could do a deal with.

1:04:30.634 --> 1:04:34.369
I don't want to do it.
I have to do it.

1:04:34.371 --> 1:04:40.275
- You don't have to do--
- I have to do it!

1:04:40.277 --> 1:04:44.212
Okay, okay.
You have to do it.

1:04:44.214 --> 1:04:50.452
But can we-- can we
at least talk awhile
before you do it?

1:04:52.990 --> 1:04:54.089
Sure.

1:05:01.431 --> 1:05:03.632
I want you to know that
I've never done this before.

1:05:03.634 --> 1:05:07.469
You don't have to
kill anyone today, Kipper.

1:05:07.471 --> 1:05:10.138
Mary:
You don't have to do
what Dec says.

1:05:10.140 --> 1:05:12.240
You're not the sidekick.

1:05:12.242 --> 1:05:15.343
Don't call me...

1:05:15.345 --> 1:05:17.679
an 'effing sidekick, okay?

1:05:17.681 --> 1:05:19.381
- I hate being a sidekick.
- I know, I know.

1:05:19.383 --> 1:05:21.016
Okay, I'm gonna do it.

1:05:21.018 --> 1:05:22.317
- Oh.
- Oh, no, no. No, no.

1:05:22.319 --> 1:05:23.618
I'm gonna do it
and then I'm gonna go.

1:05:23.620 --> 1:05:26.621
Okay.

1:05:26.623 --> 1:05:28.990
Just let me say
my prayers first.

1:05:28.992 --> 1:05:31.192
You still believe?

1:05:31.194 --> 1:05:33.261
Technically,
I'm still a nun.

1:05:33.263 --> 1:05:36.698
- Hmm? How?
- Well, I was never defrocked

1:05:36.700 --> 1:05:39.968
'cause I was just a novice,
so they didn't bother.

1:05:39.970 --> 1:05:41.536
Well, you were pretty well
defrocked tonight, love,
in the hotel.

1:05:41.538 --> 1:05:43.171
I saw you, okay?
Some nun you are.

1:05:43.173 --> 1:05:46.341
Lots of nuns sin, Kipper.
We're only human.

1:05:50.714 --> 1:05:53.214
Okay.

1:05:53.216 --> 1:05:55.417
Okay, ask for forgiveness.
Come on.

1:05:55.419 --> 1:05:57.452
And say one for me.

1:06:07.731 --> 1:06:13.635
Dear Lord, please forgive me
for my sins of the flesh.

1:06:15.238 --> 1:06:17.739
And, please,

1:06:17.741 --> 1:06:20.408
have mercy on the soul
of Kipper Jones.

1:06:20.410 --> 1:06:24.746
I know that Matthew 20:13 says

1:06:24.748 --> 1:06:27.582
that he who kills a nun
shall know no forgiveness,

1:06:27.584 --> 1:06:30.251
but instead will burn
in a fiery pit.

1:06:30.253 --> 1:06:32.253
But please, please,

1:06:32.255 --> 1:06:34.589
make an exception
in Kipper's case,

1:06:34.591 --> 1:06:36.658
for he knows not
what he does.

1:06:36.660 --> 1:06:41.730
- Did you hear that? Hey!
- Do you mind? I'm praying.

1:06:41.732 --> 1:06:44.132
Well, that's not
in the 'effing Bible.

1:06:44.134 --> 1:06:45.767
Sure it is.

1:06:45.769 --> 1:06:48.503
You think there's
no scripture covering
nun killers?

1:06:52.776 --> 1:06:55.276
And please, Lord,

1:06:55.278 --> 1:06:58.279
have mercy on Kipper's soul.

1:06:58.281 --> 1:07:03.451
I know that according to
your holy word in John 3:4,

1:07:03.453 --> 1:07:07.155
you say that the eyes
will be plucked out of the head

1:07:07.157 --> 1:07:10.158
of anyone who slays a nun

1:07:10.160 --> 1:07:12.227
or the protector of a nun.

1:07:12.229 --> 1:07:14.763
The protector of the nun?
It does not say that.

1:07:14.765 --> 1:07:17.799
Show me.
Show me where it says that
in the Bible.

1:07:17.801 --> 1:07:20.535
Show me in the passages
where those words are used.

1:07:20.537 --> 1:07:22.203
We don't have a Bible.

1:07:22.205 --> 1:07:23.638
But we're in
a bloody church, mate!

1:07:23.640 --> 1:07:25.473
Good point. Good point.
Good point.

1:07:25.475 --> 1:07:29.811
You, get over there.
Show me.

1:07:29.813 --> 1:07:32.313
Show me in that Bible.

1:07:32.315 --> 1:07:33.815
The holy Bible.

1:07:33.817 --> 1:07:35.183
Holy fuck.

1:07:35.185 --> 1:07:36.451
Move.

1:07:36.453 --> 1:07:40.088
Show me Matthew, John...

1:07:41.825 --> 1:07:45.260
Show me where it says
those words, huh?

1:07:49.833 --> 1:07:51.399
This Bible's in Latin.

1:07:52.669 --> 1:07:54.669
But that's what it means.

1:07:54.671 --> 1:07:57.105
I'm coming. I'm coming.

1:08:02.679 --> 1:08:09.517
<i>"Nonne ex denario</i>
<i>convenisti mecum."</i>

1:08:09.519 --> 1:08:12.420
<i>"Nonne"</i> means "nun."

1:08:12.422 --> 1:08:16.357
<i>"Ex denario"</i> means...

1:08:16.359 --> 1:08:18.526
<i>"Convenisti mecum."</i>

1:08:18.528 --> 1:08:20.762
"The convent's down a nun."

1:08:20.764 --> 1:08:22.530
<i>"Non facio tibi."</i>

1:08:22.532 --> 1:08:26.201
"The faceless man
who does this evil act."

1:08:28.238 --> 1:08:29.404
If you're lying to me--

1:08:29.406 --> 1:08:34.876
if you are lying to me...

1:08:34.878 --> 1:08:37.712
Why are they still here,
Kipper?

1:08:37.714 --> 1:08:40.615
How long can this
possibly take?

1:08:43.720 --> 1:08:45.887
Get out, get out! Huh?

1:08:45.889 --> 1:08:48.556
Okay, okay.

1:08:48.558 --> 1:08:50.258
- Stay there!
- Okay.

1:08:50.260 --> 1:08:53.461
Huh? Hey!

1:08:55.765 --> 1:08:56.831
You...

1:09:06.576 --> 1:09:08.676
I was gonna do it,
but I couldn't do it.
I'm sorry, Dec.

1:09:30.300 --> 1:09:34.435
- She's a nun.
- Yeah?

1:09:34.437 --> 1:09:36.671
Well, I'm a Methodist.

1:09:36.673 --> 1:09:39.307
- ( grunts )
- ( gunshot )

1:09:39.309 --> 1:09:41.409
( groaning )

1:09:41.411 --> 1:09:42.577
Statton!

1:09:45.182 --> 1:09:46.514
( groaning )

1:09:52.789 --> 1:09:54.222
Kipper:
I'm sorry, Dec.

1:09:54.224 --> 1:09:58.326
I couldn't let you do it.

1:09:58.328 --> 1:09:59.861
They're innocent.
I couldn't.

1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:05.200
( muttering )

1:10:08.972 --> 1:10:10.705
Oh! Kipper!

1:10:10.707 --> 1:10:13.808
Oh, Kipper! Kipper.

1:10:13.810 --> 1:10:16.411
Kipper:
I couldn't let him do it.
I couldn't.

1:10:16.413 --> 1:10:18.613
I couldn't let him do it.
It isn't right.

1:10:18.615 --> 1:10:21.482
( Kipper groaning )

1:10:21.484 --> 1:10:23.685
What in the name of Saint Tropez
is going on in here?

1:10:23.687 --> 1:10:25.520
Mother Superior,
call an ambulance!

1:10:25.522 --> 1:10:27.855
Call the police,
Father Donald.

1:10:27.857 --> 1:10:29.691
Call the ambulance.
Call the police.

1:10:29.693 --> 1:10:31.693
- ( Kipper groaning )
- Mary: Come here.

1:10:31.695 --> 1:10:34.896
- Oh.
- ( panting )

1:10:35.999 --> 1:10:42.003
Will you pray for me, Mary?

1:10:42.005 --> 1:10:43.271
Will you pray for me?

1:10:45.675 --> 1:10:47.809
Mary: You're gonna
be fine, Pirate King.

1:10:47.811 --> 1:10:49.744
Just hold on.

1:11:10.533 --> 1:11:12.867
Statton:
Mary, don't go.
I've got your pendant.

1:11:12.869 --> 1:11:15.870
Mary:
It doesn't matter anyway.
Forget it.

1:11:15.872 --> 1:11:18.773
- Statton: Of course it does.
- Mary: It doesn't. Look...

1:11:21.411 --> 1:11:24.879
...when I was 18,
I stowed away on a ship.

1:11:24.881 --> 1:11:28.549
Stowed away?
What year was this, 1872?

1:11:28.551 --> 1:11:30.718
A cargo ship,

1:11:30.720 --> 1:11:35.056
to get here, because...

1:11:35.058 --> 1:11:37.425
this is where she lived.

1:11:37.427 --> 1:11:39.560
Your birth mother.

1:11:39.562 --> 1:11:44.632
And I thought she would be
so excited to meet me.

1:11:47.070 --> 1:11:52.907
Well, she refused to see me.

1:11:52.909 --> 1:11:55.576
Left me standing
at the front door.

1:11:55.578 --> 1:11:59.514
She basically
abandoned me again.

1:12:02.452 --> 1:12:03.818
Why are you back here?

1:12:08.458 --> 1:12:09.657
Really, why?

1:12:15.098 --> 1:12:16.998
She's dying, Statton.

1:12:20.770 --> 1:12:23.938
Her husband wrote me,
told me he'd get me in,

1:12:23.940 --> 1:12:25.106
that she should see me.

1:12:25.108 --> 1:12:27.575
"Should."
Should! Not "wants to."

1:12:27.577 --> 1:12:30.878
Things are different
when people are dying.

1:12:30.880 --> 1:12:33.948
Look, I don't even think
he told her I was coming.

1:12:33.950 --> 1:12:35.616
She probably would have
just rejected me

1:12:35.618 --> 1:12:37.385
and then died
right in front of me.

1:12:37.387 --> 1:12:40.388
Ah, she--
she might no reject you.

1:12:40.390 --> 1:12:42.490
Yes. Yes.

1:12:42.492 --> 1:12:44.492
And that's the comfort
I can live with

1:12:44.494 --> 1:12:45.960
for the rest of my life.

1:12:45.962 --> 1:12:49.964
I can live with uncertainty.
It's my specialty.

1:12:49.966 --> 1:12:53.634
What I can't live with is
a second round of rejection.

1:12:53.636 --> 1:12:56.504
I just can't.
And why should I?

1:12:56.506 --> 1:12:59.874
Why should I let her
make me feel like shit
on her deathbed?

1:13:01.978 --> 1:13:03.878
Well, it might not
feel like that.

1:13:06.149 --> 1:13:09.984
It might feel like...

1:13:09.986 --> 1:13:11.652
home.

1:13:11.654 --> 1:13:14.422
How do you know?

1:13:17.660 --> 1:13:23.531
Well, you know
adventure, Mary.

1:13:23.533 --> 1:13:26.901
Home is my forte.

1:13:57.133 --> 1:13:58.699
Gosh.

1:13:58.701 --> 1:14:01.569
- I'm--
- You're her...

1:14:01.571 --> 1:14:03.538
when I first met her.

1:14:05.742 --> 1:14:08.576
You can see her now.

1:14:08.578 --> 1:14:10.044
She's very ill.

1:14:10.046 --> 1:14:13.047
She'll only be able
to manage a short time.

1:14:23.193 --> 1:14:24.725
Hello.

1:14:28.031 --> 1:14:30.097
Oh, my gosh.

1:14:30.099 --> 1:14:32.834
( speaking Welsh )

1:14:32.836 --> 1:14:35.069
( continuing in Welsh )

1:14:35.071 --> 1:14:37.205
I'm sorry,
I'm not very good at Welsh.

1:14:37.207 --> 1:14:39.540
( speaking Welsh )

1:14:39.542 --> 1:14:41.909
I don't think
she knows who we are.

1:14:41.911 --> 1:14:43.244
She doesn't know
who anyone is.

1:14:43.246 --> 1:14:45.746
She's got dementia.

1:14:45.748 --> 1:14:47.748
Then why did you invite me

1:14:47.750 --> 1:14:49.884
if she doesn't know
who anyone is?

1:14:49.886 --> 1:14:52.253
I worried you wouldn't come.

1:14:52.255 --> 1:14:55.089
She can remember the past.

1:14:55.091 --> 1:14:58.259
She gets distressed at times.

1:14:58.261 --> 1:15:01.128
Please, I think
you might help her.

1:15:22.218 --> 1:15:23.784
You came.

1:15:29.292 --> 1:15:30.791
I came.

1:15:30.793 --> 1:15:34.128
David said
I need to give you advice

1:15:34.130 --> 1:15:36.664
for your honeymoon.

1:15:36.666 --> 1:15:38.132
The only thing
I can say is this,

1:15:38.134 --> 1:15:42.136
the best marriages
are those between

1:15:42.138 --> 1:15:45.139
an ocean
and a lighthouse.

1:15:45.141 --> 1:15:49.677
Two lighthouses are boring.

1:15:49.679 --> 1:15:52.680
Two oceans crash about.

1:15:52.682 --> 1:15:57.318
But a lighthouse
and an ocean

1:15:57.320 --> 1:15:59.186
will last forever.

1:16:00.757 --> 1:16:03.090
Take turns!

1:16:04.761 --> 1:16:07.929
Let him be the ocean
sometimes, darling.

1:16:07.931 --> 1:16:11.832
Turn your lights on
so he can find you.

1:16:11.834 --> 1:16:14.602
You don't have to be
the ocean all the time.

1:16:19.342 --> 1:16:21.242
No, no, no, don't take her!
Bring her back.

1:16:21.244 --> 1:16:23.344
It's just
a hot water bottle, Aurelie.

1:16:23.346 --> 1:16:24.779
Aurelie:
They've taken her!
Bring her back!

1:16:24.781 --> 1:16:28.015
- She's mine!
- No, I'm her.

1:16:28.017 --> 1:16:29.350
Aurelie, I'm her.

1:16:29.352 --> 1:16:30.952
Make them bring her back,
sister.

1:16:30.954 --> 1:16:34.889
I'm here. It's me.

1:16:34.891 --> 1:16:37.625
I'm her.

1:16:45.368 --> 1:16:47.101
Say my name.

1:16:51.207 --> 1:16:52.273
Mother.

1:16:55.044 --> 1:16:56.110
Yes.

1:17:03.753 --> 1:17:05.052
You're Charlotte.

1:17:07.890 --> 1:17:09.657
I'm Charlotte.

1:17:25.074 --> 1:17:26.307
Come with me.

1:17:28.244 --> 1:17:30.911
I can't miss my court date.

1:17:34.083 --> 1:17:35.416
I'll definitely keep
in touch, though, eh?

1:17:35.418 --> 1:17:37.151
Hmm.

1:17:41.791 --> 1:17:43.924
- Take this.
- Oh.

1:17:43.926 --> 1:17:46.661
- For your legal expenses.
- No.

1:17:46.663 --> 1:17:51.432
Go put a deposit
on a flat or something.

1:17:51.434 --> 1:17:54.769
If you promise to go
to the mainland one day.

1:17:55.938 --> 1:17:57.705
One day.

1:18:48.391 --> 1:18:51.325
( chattering )

1:18:54.097 --> 1:18:57.298
<i> ( music playing )</i>

1:19:13.349 --> 1:19:15.182
Excuse me, excuse me!

1:19:15.184 --> 1:19:16.283
Mary!

1:19:16.285 --> 1:19:17.418
Mary!

1:19:19.188 --> 1:19:20.287
Mary.

1:19:29.365 --> 1:19:30.931
You know you're early, right?

1:19:30.933 --> 1:19:33.200
- What?
- You're supposed to come

1:19:33.202 --> 1:19:34.535
when I'm on the ferry.

1:19:34.537 --> 1:19:36.070
Yell, "Stop the boat!"

1:19:36.072 --> 1:19:40.207
Well, you know me,
I'm punctual.

1:19:42.211 --> 1:19:43.911
You know you can't really

1:19:43.913 --> 1:19:46.213
jump in front
of a bullet, right?

1:19:46.215 --> 1:19:48.516
It was instinct.

1:19:48.518 --> 1:19:51.218
Huh.

1:19:51.220 --> 1:19:53.120
You are an ocean after all.
