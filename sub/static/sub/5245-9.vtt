00:54.097 --> 00:56.766
Good morning, Sergeant.

00:56.975 --> 00:59.227
Good morning, Paisa.
What have you got for us?

00:59.310 --> 01:04.232
I've got plumbing valves,
a bunch of clean towels,

01:04.315 --> 01:06.401
and extra uniforms for the guards.

01:14.993 --> 01:17.036
Let him go. He's been checked.

01:17.245 --> 01:19.038
Continue. Continue, Paisa.

01:19.247 --> 01:20.832
Thank you, Sergeant.

01:20.915 --> 01:22.709
- Good day.
- Good day.

01:22.917 --> 01:26.171
- Good day, Paisa.
- Thank you! Good day, Sergeant.

02:01.748 --> 02:04.667
You're here, my friend!

02:04.751 --> 02:07.420
- How you doing, Velasco?
- Good, brother. How was the trip?

02:07.504 --> 02:09.464
Fine, fine. What a long drive!

02:09.547 --> 02:11.257
- Really?
- It's really hot.

02:11.341 --> 02:12.675
Did you encounter any problems?

02:12.759 --> 02:15.428
Nothing. Perfect. Complete success.

02:15.512 --> 02:19.682
I brought everything, including
the special items requested by Pablo.

02:19.766 --> 02:21.476
- What's going on, buddy?
- Blackie!

02:21.559 --> 02:25.188
- I thought you forgot about us.
- Let me show you.

02:27.440 --> 02:31.611
Oh, my God. All right, boys!
Get a ladder over here!

02:37.492 --> 02:39.911
- Welcome to La Catedral.
- Hello.

02:39.994 --> 02:42.121
Come on down, ladies.

02:43.915 --> 02:46.042
We'll take care of you.

03:17.156 --> 03:20.326
Come on! Hurry up!
What? Is it heavy?

03:21.619 --> 03:24.664
- That looks delicious, Paisa.
- All right, lobsters.

04:41.824 --> 04:43.076
Excuse me, boss.

04:43.826 --> 04:45.370
I've got a report.

04:45.453 --> 04:48.164
Moncada and Galeano
are reporting that we got 10,000 kilos

04:48.247 --> 04:50.541
through Mexico and the Caribbean.

04:50.625 --> 04:52.710
Did they pay the war tax?

04:52.794 --> 04:56.089
Yes, boss, but ever since
you settled things with the government,

04:56.172 --> 04:58.466
a lot of other people
have been complaining.

04:59.842 --> 05:05.765
My expenses in and out of the prison
must be covered by everyone.

05:05.848 --> 05:07.016
Understood.

05:07.225 --> 05:10.979
Moncada and Galeano said the Cali cartel
are preparing for a ceasefire.

05:13.314 --> 05:15.108
As am I.

05:17.360 --> 05:20.697
We're going to negotiate a truce.

05:20.780 --> 05:24.659
But first,
we're going to kill a few of his men.

05:27.286 --> 05:31.290
I'm sorry, boss, but the Cali cartel
is going to take that as an act of war,

05:31.374 --> 05:33.126
don't you think?

05:41.342 --> 05:43.636
The purpose of war...

05:44.762 --> 05:46.597
is peace.

07:10.431 --> 07:12.809
What's the deal, brother?

07:13.017 --> 07:14.393
Look what you've done to my car.

07:14.602 --> 07:16.354
- Where?
- Look at this traffic jam.

07:16.437 --> 07:18.773
Look what you did to my car!

07:18.856 --> 07:20.691
- How am I gonna drive this?
- It's nothing.

07:20.775 --> 07:22.652
Look at the fucking traffic jam
this is causing.

07:22.735 --> 07:23.569
Yeah, man!

07:27.824 --> 07:29.909
And you don't even speak Spanish?
Get out of here.

07:29.992 --> 07:31.911
- Don't mess with me, asshole.
- Easy, man.

07:31.994 --> 07:36.666
Son of a bitch. Are you gonna hit me?
What the hell have you come here for, fag?

07:36.874 --> 07:39.335
I deserve respect, you son of a bitch.
So that's it, then.

07:39.418 --> 07:42.130
What, are you gonna hit me?
You and who else?

07:44.382 --> 07:48.052
OK, take it easy.
It's all right. It's OK, now.

07:51.139 --> 07:53.057
- Calm down, asshole.
- OK?

07:53.141 --> 07:55.685
- Relax, man. OK.
- OK?

07:55.768 --> 07:57.687
OK, calm down.

07:58.646 --> 08:00.356
Have some tolerance.

09:56.389 --> 09:59.642
- Do you hear that?
- What?

09:59.725 --> 10:03.562
People. Children. Laughter.

10:03.771 --> 10:07.066
Even the vendors are back out.

10:09.277 --> 10:12.947
And all because we gave Escobar
the keys to his own prison.

10:14.115 --> 10:16.284
You did the right thing.

10:16.367 --> 10:17.994
You think?

10:20.162 --> 10:22.164
You should be happy.

10:23.207 --> 10:26.335
Finally, people can return
to their normal lives.

10:26.419 --> 10:29.297
Finally... we are at peace.

10:52.111 --> 10:56.449
We spoke with Pablo,
and he is willing to negotiate.

11:00.870 --> 11:03.831
Ten of my men
have just been killed.

11:04.040 --> 11:07.501
Is that how you guys
begin negotiations?

11:07.585 --> 11:09.045
Two things, Pacho.

11:09.253 --> 11:15.926
First... Mr. Galeano and I
had nothing to do with those deaths.

11:16.010 --> 11:20.348
And the second thing...
this is war, Pacho.

11:20.431 --> 11:24.477
There are deaths everywhere,
and we have casualties as well.

11:28.773 --> 11:31.359
We are willing
to pay three million dollars

11:31.442 --> 11:34.904
to settle the dispute
we had in Los Angeles.

11:36.989 --> 11:39.742
Pablo won't accept anything
under $12 million, Pacho.

11:41.118 --> 11:44.914
Twelve million is nothing to you.

11:49.251 --> 11:51.045
Do you want to know something?

11:51.253 --> 11:53.589
It's over.

11:53.798 --> 11:55.883
What's over?

11:55.966 --> 11:58.302
The Medellin cartel.

11:59.261 --> 12:01.639
No, you're wrong, Pacho.

12:01.847 --> 12:04.850
We export twice the amount you do.

12:04.934 --> 12:08.687
You invited me here
to give me this line of bullshit?

12:09.647 --> 12:14.735
Pablo put a war tax on the two of you
for $250,000 a month.

12:14.819 --> 12:16.737
That's how he treats
his friends and associates?

12:16.946 --> 12:21.951
Don't forget that, thanks to
Mr. Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria,

12:22.034 --> 12:26.330
extradition was abolished.
That serves you very well, doesn't it?

12:26.539 --> 12:28.958
He was the one
who got us into this mess.

12:29.041 --> 12:33.879
Killing politicians and cops,
bombing street corners and airplanes.

12:34.088 --> 12:37.091
He started this fucking war.

12:39.301 --> 12:41.345
Are we going to negotiate or not?

13:59.465 --> 14:01.300
We're here, gentlemen!

14:05.971 --> 14:08.557
- Gentlemen!
- What a bumpy ride, Paisa.

14:08.641 --> 14:10.893
Where did you learn to drive?

14:11.727 --> 14:14.480
We closed the deal at ten million dollars.

14:14.563 --> 14:17.900
This takes care of the problem
we had in LA and ends the war.

14:19.485 --> 14:21.612
Sounds like a good proposition.

14:21.695 --> 14:23.948
Do you know what this means, boss?

14:24.031 --> 14:27.826
We can maintain our infrastructure
and the government won't be the wiser.

14:27.910 --> 14:33.207
That way, we can... double our exports
in less than a month, Pablo.

14:37.336 --> 14:39.046
How did he behave...

14:40.047 --> 14:42.091
when he offered you the money?

14:43.884 --> 14:46.220
What do you mean,
"how did he behave"?

14:47.304 --> 14:49.056
What was his attitude?

14:50.057 --> 14:52.393
Well... he was respectful, Pablo.

14:52.601 --> 14:54.311
Respectful in what way?

14:54.395 --> 14:57.481
- He wants peace, just like us.
- Yes, but...

14:57.565 --> 15:00.609
how did he react
when you told him our solution?

15:00.818 --> 15:02.361
In a positive manner.

15:02.444 --> 15:04.780
He just offered you the money,
just like that?

15:06.699 --> 15:11.036
Well... he started
at three million dollars. Right?

15:12.162 --> 15:14.957
But we said no, and told him
you wouldn't take less than 12.

15:15.040 --> 15:19.253
So he offered ten,
and we felt that was a fair deal.

15:20.254 --> 15:22.673
Offered you three million?

15:23.841 --> 15:27.886
He was feeling us out.
He knew we wouldn't accept that.

15:28.095 --> 15:33.851
If he really respected me,
he would be grateful if I accepted 20.

15:34.602 --> 15:38.480
That's right, boss.
Ask for 20. In one shot.

15:44.320 --> 15:47.197
Tell him I'm not happy
with less than 30.

15:48.407 --> 15:50.242
The Cali cartel won't accept that, Pablo.

15:50.451 --> 15:54.663
Thirty million...
if Cali wants peace.

16:19.897 --> 16:21.440
Very good.

16:29.698 --> 16:32.785
I also need to raise the war tax.

16:35.829 --> 16:38.957
From now on,
a million a month,

16:39.041 --> 16:42.711
for both of you...
and all our other partners.

16:51.804 --> 16:54.682
Good move beating him,
you son of a bitch.

19:20.410 --> 19:24.039
We talked with Pablo
and reached an agreement.

19:26.542 --> 19:28.544
We agreed to...

19:29.670 --> 19:32.256
- one million dollars.
- What?

19:35.884 --> 19:37.135
Right.

19:40.055 --> 19:42.224
What about the house in Cartagena?

19:42.307 --> 19:44.101
That's not happening, right?

19:44.184 --> 19:46.520
Do you want your house in Cartagena?

19:46.603 --> 19:50.274
- Of course.
- OK... you will have it.

19:50.357 --> 19:51.859
Don't you see
things are improving?

19:51.942 --> 19:54.903
No, I see things
are getting more complicated.

19:55.112 --> 19:59.575
Instead of getting better...
things are getting worse.

20:04.621 --> 20:07.457
Pablo doesn't want peace with Cali.

20:07.541 --> 20:10.544
Now, what about this war tax
he's charging you?

20:10.627 --> 20:14.464
$250,000 was a lot of money.

20:14.548 --> 20:17.676
And now a million? Ridiculous.

20:17.759 --> 20:21.847
What do you think I should do?
Call Pablo and tell him I won't pay it?

20:21.930 --> 20:24.266
- Obviously not.
- Then I don't understand.

20:24.349 --> 20:29.438
- What do you want me to do?
- It's not right, Kiko, and you know it.

20:32.566 --> 20:36.445
Look, I... adore Pablo.
I adore him.

20:39.489 --> 20:42.743
But the thing is, I don't know
what's going on with him these days.

20:49.416 --> 20:52.002
I don't know.
Maybe he's depressed.

20:52.878 --> 20:57.966
We're here in a Jacuzzi...

20:59.051 --> 21:00.844
free.

21:05.098 --> 21:07.100
Do you love me?

21:07.184 --> 21:10.687
Stop fucking around.
You make me angry.

22:48.827 --> 22:50.203
What happened?

22:51.121 --> 22:52.664
Did it stop?

22:54.332 --> 22:55.584
Good morning.

22:55.667 --> 22:57.335
- What's up?
- Are you "The Paisa"?

22:57.419 --> 23:00.338
- Yes.
- Nice to meet you. Javier Pefia.

23:00.422 --> 23:03.592
Do me a favor
and get out of the truck.

23:06.344 --> 23:09.347
- What's going on?
- Don't be afraid.

23:11.808 --> 23:13.852
Up against the truck.

23:20.067 --> 23:21.526
Let's go.

23:23.445 --> 23:25.697
Do me another favor.

23:25.781 --> 23:27.282
Open it up.

23:36.166 --> 23:37.250
Go on.

23:58.605 --> 24:01.942
Look, gringos...
you don't have the right to do this.

24:02.025 --> 24:04.361
Of course we have the right.

24:04.444 --> 24:10.450
You just press the button in the truck
and we will do the rest, OK?

24:10.534 --> 24:15.497
If the boss finds out that I let you
put cameras in the truck, he'll kill me.

24:25.382 --> 24:27.843
Pablo's your boss?

24:27.926 --> 24:30.220
Yeah? Yeah.

24:39.938 --> 24:43.525
I am your boss. Yes?

24:43.608 --> 24:46.194
It's OK, it's OK!
I'll do whatever you say.

24:46.278 --> 24:47.612
Yeah?

24:54.286 --> 24:56.538
Are you OK, friend?

25:30.030 --> 25:31.114
Good day.

26:11.821 --> 26:15.158
- This is a--
- Yes, it's a roulette wheel.

26:15.242 --> 26:18.328
He has a casino
right there at La Catedral.

26:19.329 --> 26:23.250
- Where did you get these pictures?
- From the DEA.

26:23.333 --> 26:25.168
Of course.

26:25.252 --> 26:27.170
It's not just these pictures.

26:27.254 --> 26:30.006
They also have pictures of judges,
local government people,

26:30.090 --> 26:35.053
other narcos, prostitutes...
Even soccer players come to visit Pablo.

26:37.305 --> 26:40.809
- Who else has seen these?
- No one, as far as I know.

26:40.892 --> 26:43.103
That's why we have to act now.

26:45.272 --> 26:49.276
Do you think the DEA is capable
of leaking the photos to the media?

26:49.359 --> 26:54.114
The DEA is capable of anything.
That's why we have to do something now.

26:57.242 --> 27:01.621
At one time, Escobar...
used to own all of Colombia.

27:03.081 --> 27:05.709
Now he's just the owner
of his own prison.

27:07.627 --> 27:12.048
If I had to choose
between prostitutes at La Catedral...

27:12.924 --> 27:14.718
or bombings in the country...

27:20.598 --> 27:23.810
I would be eternally grateful
to these women.

27:30.317 --> 27:33.445
Happy birthday, Pablo!

27:35.071 --> 27:37.741
- Watch your step.
- Careful with the little girl!

27:39.367 --> 27:40.994
How are you? Welcome.

27:42.579 --> 27:45.248
Hello, sweetheart.

28:08.855 --> 28:11.941
They're the ones I hired?
I don't believe you.

28:12.025 --> 28:13.526
They are really good, Blackie.

28:13.735 --> 28:16.196
I like them.

28:16.279 --> 28:20.533
Come on, Pablo, tell us...
what are you doing these days?

28:21.493 --> 28:24.412
- How do you spend your time?
- Aside from missing his family?

28:25.538 --> 28:27.165
Of course.

28:27.248 --> 28:28.958
He's writing a book.

28:29.834 --> 28:31.836
- Mother.
- What?

28:32.045 --> 28:35.423
Isn't it true?
You are writing a book.

28:35.632 --> 28:37.509
Please, Mom.

28:37.717 --> 28:39.260
Well, then, you tell them.

28:44.724 --> 28:47.977
- It's a collection of magazine articles.
- Many articles.

28:48.061 --> 28:52.190
- Clippings. It's a book of cartoons.
- Oh, cartoons!

28:52.273 --> 28:54.943
From newspapers and magazines
all over the world.

28:55.151 --> 28:57.612
And you know what?
People write him every day.

28:57.821 --> 29:00.073
- It's because they love him.
- Of course, I can imagine.

29:00.156 --> 29:03.326
You have to find ways
to keep your mind occupied around here.

29:03.535 --> 29:08.039
Yes, my love. And you have Judy's husband
and Galeano to help you with the business.

29:08.123 --> 29:11.334
Yes, on that note,
Kiko is so grateful to you

29:11.418 --> 29:13.795
for all the responsibilities
you have given him.

29:13.878 --> 29:15.380
Thank you very much.

29:15.588 --> 29:17.132
- We were in Cartagena--
- Where?

29:17.215 --> 29:19.592
- We were in Cartagena last week.
- Oh, yeah?

29:19.801 --> 29:23.012
Oh, yes, we spent
some beautiful days there relaxing.

29:23.096 --> 29:24.973
It must feel good
to be able to relax like that.

29:25.181 --> 29:27.350
- How nice.
- Wonderful, Tata. You can't imagine.

29:27.434 --> 29:30.061
But I'll tell you,
Cartagena is really expensive.

29:30.145 --> 29:32.939
Oh, it's unaffordable.

29:33.022 --> 29:36.443
Besides, this whole "war with Cali" thing,

29:36.526 --> 29:39.612
it's tough, you know,
with the tax we have to pay.

29:39.696 --> 29:43.950
We understand it's not easy,
but there's not much we can do.

29:44.033 --> 29:45.577
It's OK.

29:53.418 --> 29:55.128
Kiko complained about that?

29:57.881 --> 29:59.799
He mentioned it.

30:03.511 --> 30:06.014
He didn't complain, Pablo,
he didn't complain.

30:06.097 --> 30:10.268
Everyone here is absolutely aware
of the huge sacrifice that you're making,

30:10.477 --> 30:13.104
for God's sake.
So I think it's normal, right?

30:13.313 --> 30:14.939
It's normal that
we'd give you our support.

30:15.148 --> 30:18.568
Well, I think it's normal...
I really do.

30:23.615 --> 30:26.868
Juan Pablito, go play with your dad
for a little while, OK?

30:26.951 --> 30:29.787
Honey, you should
play with the kids a little bit.

30:35.335 --> 30:36.711
Leave the gift here.

30:37.462 --> 30:38.880
I'll look after it.

32:21.733 --> 32:22.942
Apologize!

32:23.151 --> 32:24.569
Apologize!

32:24.652 --> 32:26.195
Apologize!

32:27.322 --> 32:29.949
- Were you watching?
- Yes.

32:30.033 --> 32:31.618
You apologize!

32:31.701 --> 32:33.620
I'm sorry, boss.

32:34.621 --> 32:36.539
I didn't mean it.

32:42.045 --> 32:44.172
- Relax.
- Are you all right, boss?

32:44.255 --> 32:46.549
Relax. That's how the game goes.

32:46.633 --> 32:49.218
Go on, go on.
You guys continue.

32:52.347 --> 32:53.931
Are you all right, sir?

32:56.184 --> 32:57.393
Boss.

32:58.227 --> 33:01.481
Excuse me, boss,
but I need to speak to you.

33:01.564 --> 33:02.982
Everything OK?

33:04.525 --> 33:07.820
- Boss, we have a problem.
- What problem?

33:08.029 --> 33:10.823
You remember that Moncada and Galeano
had a large shipment

33:10.907 --> 33:14.535
- that was seized in Boyacá?
- Yes.

33:14.619 --> 33:17.580
- 250 kilos.
- Exactly.

33:17.664 --> 33:21.959
Can you imagine, a farmer found
three million dollars buried in a field?

33:22.043 --> 33:23.461
Do you know where that was, boss?

33:25.046 --> 33:26.506
In Rionegro.

34:20.393 --> 34:22.895
There's cash buried everywhere.

34:23.813 --> 34:27.942
The guerillas, the paramilitary,
the narcos...

34:28.943 --> 34:31.612
- Everybody's burying cash.
- Yes, I know.

34:31.821 --> 34:34.741
But right on Moncada
and Galeano's property?

34:36.451 --> 34:38.953
Don't you think that's strange, boss?

34:39.912 --> 34:41.831
I think it's strange.

35:10.401 --> 35:13.821
Look. All this cash...

35:13.905 --> 35:18.075
was found... in a field.

35:18.284 --> 35:20.661
That's good luck, Pablo.

35:21.662 --> 35:26.083
Or it could be bad luck.
For you both.

35:31.047 --> 35:35.426
It was on your property,
in Rionegro.

35:35.635 --> 35:39.055
But Pablo,
those lands are over 300 acres,

35:39.138 --> 35:42.266
and most of us rent out to the farmers.

35:46.813 --> 35:52.026
You told me that you had
a 250-kilo shipment seized.

35:52.109 --> 35:53.569
That's true.

35:53.778 --> 35:55.947
The shipment equaled that amount of cash.

35:56.155 --> 35:58.407
Who told you to open your mouth?

35:58.616 --> 36:00.493
Not true?

36:02.787 --> 36:06.040
Pablo, do you think
we're stealing from you?

36:06.123 --> 36:08.960
That we made up that whole story
about the seizure?

36:09.043 --> 36:12.004
If you'd like,
check with the cops in Boyacá.

36:12.088 --> 36:16.467
Right, because cops in Boyacá
are so honest, right?

36:18.636 --> 36:21.639
Keep in mind that
we bought that property from Gustavo.

36:21.848 --> 36:27.770
I even remember Gustavo saying
that you had cash stashed in every corner.

36:30.273 --> 36:35.736
Gustavo...
would never forget where he buried cash.

36:36.821 --> 36:41.492
Who's putting this shit
in your head, Pablo? These assholes?

36:41.701 --> 36:46.497
These fuckers would sell their own mother.
We are partners and friends.

36:49.375 --> 36:53.963
Maybe that cash was lost
because I raised the tax?

36:54.171 --> 36:57.133
Bullshit.
I paid the tax and never complained.

36:57.216 --> 36:58.634
That's a lie.

37:01.470 --> 37:05.474
- Because you complained to your wife.
- I haven't complained.

37:05.558 --> 37:08.686
You have no idea
what I talk about with Judy.

37:09.520 --> 37:11.480
I understand this
is difficult for you, Pablo--

37:11.564 --> 37:13.149
What is difficult for me?

37:13.357 --> 37:16.861
Well, managing all of this.
That's why you hired us.

37:16.944 --> 37:19.906
So we can manage it
and look after it.

37:23.034 --> 37:25.494
You trust us, right?

37:27.079 --> 37:28.623
I understand this makes you anxious--

37:28.706 --> 37:31.626
- Do I look anxious?
- No, I didn't mean that.

37:31.834 --> 37:34.420
- You said with certainty that--
- No, no, what I meant to say was--

37:34.503 --> 37:39.759
- I think you're the one who's anxious.
- We didn't do shit, Pablo!

37:41.719 --> 37:47.016
With that tone of yours...
you're telling me you didn't do shit?

37:48.601 --> 37:53.105
Like I was some kind of idiot.
Is this my cash or not?!

37:53.314 --> 37:54.231
No, Pablo.

37:54.315 --> 37:58.235
Did you take it and bury it
in Rionegro or not?!

37:58.444 --> 38:00.279
For sure,
these guys hid your cash, boss.

38:00.488 --> 38:03.240
- It's the truth, you pair of liars.
- Of course, he--

38:03.324 --> 38:05.576
- Shut up, motherfucker!
- You're petty thieves!

38:05.660 --> 38:09.538
You shut up, motherfucker!
Don't you disrespect me!

38:14.043 --> 38:16.212
Pablo, look at me, man.

38:18.130 --> 38:20.341
We're family.

38:21.425 --> 38:25.221
You're my daughter's godfather.

38:25.304 --> 38:28.599
And also godfather to Galeano's kids.

38:30.184 --> 38:31.352
What's going on?

38:37.358 --> 38:39.318
We're like brothers.

38:40.736 --> 38:43.906
We're partners and friends.

38:44.115 --> 38:47.076
We've been in this
our whole lives, Pablo.

38:47.159 --> 38:50.746
We made our first trip to Miami together.

38:50.830 --> 38:56.711
We made so much cash together that
we don't even know what we spent it on.

38:57.795 --> 38:59.797
What's the problem?

39:00.631 --> 39:02.925
What's happening?

39:05.886 --> 39:08.556
The two of us love you very much.

39:08.639 --> 39:10.850
And we're very grateful.

39:32.705 --> 39:34.248
All right.

39:35.916 --> 39:38.669
Being stuck in here...

39:39.795 --> 39:41.839
can make someone paranoid.

40:03.110 --> 40:06.739
Well, man,
these things happen, right?

40:08.032 --> 40:11.285
We're here for whatever you need.
Trust us.

40:11.494 --> 40:13.287
I'm going to make a trip to Miami.

40:13.370 --> 40:16.373
I'll bring you a few little things
to keep you entertained, OK?

40:50.616 --> 40:53.452
Pablo, don't do it! Pablo, no!

41:17.518 --> 41:20.479
You're a dog,
you son of a bitch!

41:25.943 --> 41:30.156
What does it feel like
to take a shit on your own empire?

41:31.490 --> 41:33.909
You want us to tell you
that we stole the money?

41:38.289 --> 41:44.170
At the end of the day, you'll believe
whatever you want, motherfucker.

41:55.973 --> 41:57.516
Goodbye, Kiko.

42:01.604 --> 42:04.440
Kill me if you're such a man,
motherfucker.

42:05.399 --> 42:07.651
Kill me with your own fucking hands!

42:07.735 --> 42:10.070
Who are you talking to, asshole?

42:13.699 --> 42:15.743
Motherfucker!

42:36.138 --> 42:37.389
Wait a second!

42:37.598 --> 42:39.475
Be careful, man.

42:45.940 --> 42:48.567
Look what the dead guy gave me.

43:03.165 --> 43:05.376
What the fuck!
You're going to burn all the meat!

43:05.459 --> 43:08.087
What is wrong with you? Can't you see
I'm doing it to cover the smell?

43:08.170 --> 43:12.383
- Yeah, but let's not burn it all.
- What are we gonna do with all this meat?

43:12.466 --> 43:15.344
- What are you going to do?
- What am I supposed to do?

43:15.427 --> 43:17.179
What?

43:30.067 --> 43:32.236
Boss, are you OK?

43:33.821 --> 43:35.823
Do you need anything, boss?

43:37.783 --> 43:40.786
We're grilling some meat.
Do you want some?

43:42.037 --> 43:44.415
No. I'm not hungry.

44:11.900 --> 44:13.360
Navegante.

44:14.320 --> 44:15.863
Boss.

44:16.739 --> 44:20.242
- Do you want me to wax it?
- No, relax.

44:20.326 --> 44:23.078
This one's my favorite.
I enjoy it.

44:23.871 --> 44:26.623
This is a beautiful car.

44:27.499 --> 44:30.169
Anything new on Galeano and Moncada?

44:32.921 --> 44:35.716
Looks like the rumors are true, boss.

44:40.346 --> 44:42.097
It's a shame.

44:44.767 --> 44:46.643
I warned them.

44:46.727 --> 44:49.730
As the twig is bent, so grows the tree.

44:56.737 --> 44:59.615
Do you still have that DEA contact?

44:59.698 --> 45:03.285
Javier Pefia? Of course.

45:03.369 --> 45:06.330
I want you to contact him
and confirm the rumors.

45:06.538 --> 45:10.084
They're just as interested
in screwing Escobar as we are.

45:12.586 --> 45:18.884
I haven't heard from him since yesterday.
I've called everyone. I'm so worried.

45:18.967 --> 45:22.304
Pablo told me
that they left La Catedral.

45:22.388 --> 45:24.390
Just relax, sweetie.

45:25.265 --> 45:26.975
Your husband is fine.

45:28.143 --> 45:30.396
No, thank you.

45:32.648 --> 45:37.486
Maybe... they had to go
somewhere else urgently?

45:37.694 --> 45:39.446
Or maybe they left
without saying anything.

45:39.655 --> 45:41.615
The way our men usually do.

45:41.698 --> 45:44.243
Yes, but it's a little strange,
don't you think?

45:44.326 --> 45:48.664
Kiko was very clear that he had
a meeting with Pablo at La Catedral.

45:48.747 --> 45:50.332
He said he would be home later.

45:50.541 --> 45:55.003
We're trying to have another baby.
I think I told you that.

45:55.212 --> 45:59.800
No? We're trying to have another baby,
and the time is right,

45:59.883 --> 46:03.220
so we had a very important date to keep.

46:03.303 --> 46:07.433
Are you sure that Pablo
told you that Kiko left La Catedral?

46:10.936 --> 46:13.647
Are you telling me
that my husband is a liar?

46:14.982 --> 46:17.192
I want my husband back.

46:20.070 --> 46:24.324
If Pablo told Tata that they left...

46:24.533 --> 46:26.702
it's because they left.

46:27.619 --> 46:32.833
Listen...
Pablo is your kids' godfather.

46:32.916 --> 46:35.294
He would never hurt them.

49:15.287 --> 49:16.788
What do you think?

49:22.586 --> 49:25.464
These photos are worth looking into.

49:26.632 --> 49:28.300
And believe me, I'm going to.
