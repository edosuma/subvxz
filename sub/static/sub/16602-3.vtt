WEBVTT

00:08.042 --> 00:10.211
Ali, he's going in my room.

00:10.278 --> 00:13.147
- Josh, that's not fair.
- Guys, we can rotate.

00:13.214 --> 00:14.948
- Come on, let's go,
 let's go, let's go.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.585
Very good plan.
That's very good.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.955
Shelly, oh, Shelly,
 I love you.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.225
You are not naming
that turtle Shelly.

00:26.060 --> 00:28.296
I think it's a great
 name for a turtle.

00:28.362 --> 00:29.597
Huh?

00:29.663 --> 00:31.365
So "shelly."

00:31.432 --> 00:33.067
I mean, there's
none more shelly

00:33.134 --> 00:35.436
than one who lives
in a shell.

00:35.503 --> 00:37.838
Nacho. Guys,
 Nacho is his name.

00:37.905 --> 00:39.273
Nacho.

00:39.340 --> 00:40.241
Nacho.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074

00:52.653 --> 00:56.324
Mom! Dad!
 Someone kidnapped Nacho!

00:58.792 --> 01:00.594
- Nancy Kerrigan's
 coaching staff

01:00.661 --> 01:02.830
is calling for
 Tonya Harding's withdrawal

01:02.896 --> 01:04.298
from the U.S. Olympic team.

01:04.364 --> 01:06.200
- How important is it
to win a gold medal

01:06.267 --> 01:08.269
you're gonna break
 this girl's kneecaps?

01:08.336 --> 01:10.871
- You never know
 the whole story.

01:17.478 --> 01:19.647
- I still don't feel
 anything, Sarah.

01:19.713 --> 01:22.216
Uh, come here.
 Suck it in. Hold it.

01:22.283 --> 01:23.584
Oh, shit, I forgot
to cover the carb.

01:33.561 --> 01:35.729
Is it all the way in, Rita?

01:35.796 --> 01:37.965
Yeah, Josh, it's in.

01:38.031 --> 01:39.967
Oh, my God. Rita.

01:45.739 --> 01:47.208
- You married him.

01:47.275 --> 01:49.643
- I did when I
 was 4 years old.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.912
We had a ceremony.

01:51.979 --> 01:54.815
- I'll never be happy again.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.608
So this week
 I'm having my students

02:54.675 --> 02:57.878
take two pieces and try
 to find similarities
 between them,

02:57.945 --> 02:59.447
so we're doing
 Eileen Myles' "Chelsea Girls"

02:59.513 --> 03:01.349
and Ntozake Shange's
 For Colored Girls.

03:01.415 --> 03:04.518
Ah. Uh, The Rainbow,
 Enuf, Suicide--

03:04.585 --> 03:06.220
Isn't Enuf, Isn't Enuf.

03:06.287 --> 03:08.088
It. Yeah, it Is Enuf.

03:08.155 --> 03:11.024
No. I-- I-- It's When
 the Rainbow Isn't Enuf.

03:11.091 --> 03:13.527
Well, the title is
 When the Rainbow Is Enuf.

03:13.594 --> 03:15.729
We can argue about whether
 it is or isn't enough,

03:15.796 --> 03:19.533
uh, but the title
 is Is Enuf.

03:20.801 --> 03:21.969
So, you flossing?

03:22.035 --> 03:23.971
Well, I mean,

03:24.037 --> 03:25.473
is that going to mean
 it's going to hurt?

03:25.539 --> 03:27.074
- I'm a little anxious.
- Really?

03:27.140 --> 03:29.843
Do you want some gas,
 a little bit of gas?

03:29.910 --> 03:32.646
You mean like nitrous?

03:32.713 --> 03:35.048
- Mm-hmm.
 - For a cleaning?

03:35.115 --> 03:36.183
Just a little bit,
take the edge off.

03:36.250 --> 03:38.352
Katrinka, will you
bring the blanket

03:38.419 --> 03:39.687
and headphones in, please?

03:39.753 --> 03:41.188
We're going to get
some nitrous here.

03:41.255 --> 03:42.390
There's a blanket?

03:42.456 --> 03:43.424
It's a blanket
and headphones.

03:43.491 --> 03:45.359
- Hi, doctor.
 - Hello.

03:45.426 --> 03:46.594
- How are you?
- Hi, Katrinka.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.128
I brought you music.

03:48.195 --> 03:50.664
Best medicine in the world.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.666
- You just relax back, okay?

03:52.733 --> 03:54.802
Just like that.
 Perfect.

03:54.868 --> 03:56.437
There you go.
 I'll take you back.

03:56.504 --> 03:58.539
Mm.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.344
Coming over your head.

04:05.212 --> 04:07.981
So do me a favor.
 Breathe in through your nose.

04:08.048 --> 04:10.518
- Is there anybody out there?

04:10.584 --> 04:12.085
And out through your nose.

04:12.152 --> 04:15.456
Are you good? You're good.

04:21.894 --> 04:24.264
- Welcome back.
 Welcome back.

04:24.332 --> 04:25.799
Let's take a moment to get
 to know our contestants,

04:25.866 --> 04:27.901
starting off
 with Caitlyn Jenner.

04:27.968 --> 04:30.704
Well, I'm a much televised
 parent of ten children.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.940
Let's walk right over
 to Miss Ntozake Shange

04:33.006 --> 04:34.575
and Ali-- Ali Pfefferman.

04:34.642 --> 04:35.876
I'm just here to have
 my teeth cleaned.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.911
Bill, what have we got?

04:37.978 --> 04:40.848
- Come on, get a...
 - There you go. Good job.

04:40.914 --> 04:43.050
A J, Dr. Gunderson, a J.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.318
- Hi, Ali.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.253
- Ali, please.
Ali, open wide.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.323
Oh! Sorry about that.

04:49.390 --> 04:50.624
I'd like to solve the puzzle.

04:50.691 --> 04:51.859
I would like
 to solve the puzzle.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.126
- "God is a woman."

04:53.193 --> 04:54.828
- Ali?
 - Ali, say ah.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.532
- Oh, my goodness.
 - Take a break.

04:58.599 --> 05:00.300
Yes, yes, yes,
 yes, yes, yes, yes.

05:00.368 --> 05:01.702
Just relax.

05:01.769 --> 05:04.004
It's okay.
 You're doing great.

05:04.071 --> 05:05.506
You're doing great.

05:07.775 --> 05:09.510
All right, look,
all I mean to say

05:09.577 --> 05:11.812
is that I found this report
very hard to read.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.313
- Do you understand?

05:13.381 --> 05:14.815
I don't know what kind
 of font they use,

05:14.882 --> 05:16.216
but I would prefer
 Helvetica.

05:16.283 --> 05:18.018
I definitely
prefer columns

05:18.085 --> 05:19.587
as opposed
to bullet points.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.489
The thing that I like
 about bullet points--

05:21.555 --> 05:23.256
Did you see?
 I used Roman numerals.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.693
Hold on. Hold on.
 We'll work that out later.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.461
Okay. Moving on now.
We're going to go

05:27.528 --> 05:29.897
to our next topic:
new board members.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.365
- Okay, that's fine.
 - Let it be noted

05:31.432 --> 05:33.834
we're about to vote
on potential new members

05:33.901 --> 05:35.869
Claire Strausskleiner,
 Hyman Glook,

05:35.936 --> 05:37.938
- and Sarah Pfefferman.
- Duly noted.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.507
Let's start
 with Ms. Pfefferman.

05:39.573 --> 05:40.608
All those in favor?

05:40.674 --> 05:42.275
Uh, can we just take a minute?

05:42.342 --> 05:45.245
I'm having a feeling
about Sarah Pfefferman.

05:45.312 --> 05:47.214
- What's the problem?
 - Well, okay.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.450
She's got
 a really dark energy.

05:49.517 --> 05:51.652
- A real dark energy.
 - I'm so sorry.

05:51.719 --> 05:54.555
I-- Can you-- Could you
clarify "dark energy"?

05:54.622 --> 05:56.089
I'm not sure what that means.

05:56.156 --> 05:57.925
It's like dark energy
 that comes out in anger

05:57.991 --> 05:59.126
and in sexual ways.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.694
- I--
 - I mean, come on.

06:00.761 --> 06:02.329
She is going around
 celebrating divorce.

06:02.396 --> 06:04.331
I'm not sure what this
 has to do with--

06:04.398 --> 06:05.699
I think we're wandering
into an area--

06:05.766 --> 06:07.367
It's none of our business.

06:07.435 --> 06:08.769
...that it's okay,
number 1,

06:08.836 --> 06:10.504
to live under the roof
of the someone

06:10.571 --> 06:12.806
that I made a vow with but I
 don't follow the vow now.

06:12.873 --> 06:15.242
Now I can go, and I can
sleep with other people.

06:15.308 --> 06:16.777
I can do things
 with other people.

06:16.844 --> 06:18.178
And I can tell
people about it?

06:18.245 --> 06:19.747
- I agree.
 - Yeah, it's true.

06:19.813 --> 06:22.115
And that, let me tell you,
 is contagious.

06:22.182 --> 06:23.651
- Oh, come on.
- I don't recall

06:23.717 --> 06:25.919
us ever evaluating
a potential board member

06:25.986 --> 06:28.155
based on their--
 their personal life.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.790
Right? I mean, Buzzy,
 do you have anything

06:29.857 --> 06:31.659
- that you would like to say--
 - See what I mean?

06:31.725 --> 06:32.760
...on Sarah Pfefferman's
 behalf?

06:32.826 --> 06:33.961
With all due respect,
 I think

06:34.027 --> 06:35.228
you are too close
 to this situation,

06:35.295 --> 06:36.296
and you should
 recuse yourself.

06:36.363 --> 06:37.665
- I agree.
- Just to keep it clean.

06:37.731 --> 06:38.832
- That makes sense to me.
 - Okay.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.200
So why don't we
just take a vote?

06:40.267 --> 06:41.569
- Well--
 - Everybody who's in favor

06:41.635 --> 06:43.203
of Sarah Pfefferman
being on the board,

06:43.270 --> 06:44.838
raise your hand and say "Aye."

07:01.755 --> 07:04.792
Mm-hmm. One more little
finishing touch here.

07:04.858 --> 07:06.694
- Yeah.
- That's a lot of hair.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.929
This clip-in bang,
it gives you something
to play with.

07:08.996 --> 07:10.998
- Oh, finally.

07:11.064 --> 07:12.866
A bang I can play with.

07:14.367 --> 07:15.469
Wow.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.605
Vicki.

07:17.671 --> 07:19.106
- Hmm.
 - Vic?

07:25.779 --> 07:27.481
Who the fuck are you?

07:34.387 --> 07:36.289
- Uh, Sarah?

07:36.356 --> 07:37.925
Rabbi Raquel!

07:37.991 --> 07:39.026
- Are you in the kitchen?
 - Oh, my God.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.661
Get in here.
 I'm dying to hear.

07:40.728 --> 07:41.895
Am I, like, the hottest shit

07:41.962 --> 07:43.396
that that temple
 has ever seen?

07:43.463 --> 07:45.065
Uh, oh, I mean--

07:45.132 --> 07:46.166
Tell me, tell me.

07:46.233 --> 07:47.635
Uh, yeah, it was good.

07:47.701 --> 07:48.836
- It was really good.
 - Do you want tea?

07:48.902 --> 07:50.704
- I'm making tea.
- No, that's okay.

07:50.771 --> 07:52.305
- Oh, come on.
 Have some with me.
 - Okay.

07:52.372 --> 07:53.941
- It's good for the tummy.
 - Yes.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.744
Okay, tell me.
 Tell me, tell me, tell me.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.912
Sarah, um, okay.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.014
I didn't go--
 go our way, I guess.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.483
- Just--
 - What? What do you mean?

08:03.551 --> 08:05.052
Well, Sarah--

08:06.887 --> 08:08.756
y-you have an enemy
at Mid-city.

08:08.822 --> 08:11.424
I mean, I've never seen
anything like it--

08:11.491 --> 08:13.193
- What are you talking about?
 - She poisoned the board.

08:13.260 --> 08:14.562
Who?

08:14.628 --> 08:15.963
It's not ethical
for me to tell you.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.164
Laura Milton-Kaufberger.

08:17.230 --> 08:18.265
Okay. What did she say?

08:18.331 --> 08:19.499
Sarah--

08:19.567 --> 08:20.534
What did she say?

08:20.601 --> 08:21.935
Oh. What she said

08:22.002 --> 08:24.905
is that you have
a dark energy.

08:24.972 --> 08:27.107
- I have a dark energy?
- I am so sorry.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.576
Doesn't matter.
 Let's let it go.

08:28.642 --> 08:29.810
Resting Bitchface said
 I have a dark energy?

08:29.877 --> 08:31.044
Sarah, let's move on.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.245
What was the vote?

08:32.312 --> 08:33.947
That has no bearing
on this.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.183
- 4-3?
- Honey, you don't need
any of these people

08:36.249 --> 08:37.717
to have access
 to your spirituality.

08:37.784 --> 08:40.688
- 5-2.
- This is about your
relationship to you.

08:40.754 --> 08:42.422
All you have to do
is create a space--

08:42.489 --> 08:44.124
- 6-1?
 - ...inside yourself

08:44.191 --> 08:45.392
- that has nothing to do--
 - 6-1.

08:45.458 --> 08:46.694
...with any board,
any temple.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.562
This is-- This is all
 just noise.

08:48.629 --> 08:49.763
Wait.
 Buzzy didn't vote for me?

08:49.830 --> 08:50.731
The important thing is--

08:50.798 --> 08:52.132
Nobody voted for me?

08:52.199 --> 08:54.534
Nobody voted for me.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.537
It was--

08:57.605 --> 09:00.073
It was unanimous?

09:00.140 --> 09:02.042
Didn't you
 at least vote for me?

09:02.109 --> 09:04.177
I'm-- I'm on the--
I'm on the staff,

09:04.244 --> 09:05.478
so I'm not-- I'm not
 allowed to vote.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.080
She's a cunt.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.481
Okay. Okay.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.817
- An anorexic cunt.
 - Okay.

09:18.759 --> 09:20.560
Hi, Jim Croce.

09:20.628 --> 09:21.762
What's up?

09:21.829 --> 09:23.563
Um, I found this thing,

09:23.631 --> 09:25.332
and it's, like,
kind of a mess.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.100
- Uh--
 - Sounds good.

09:27.167 --> 09:28.769
So I was just kind of, like,
 you know, fixing it up.

09:28.836 --> 09:30.270
Sounds great, but it's
 Moppa's birthday party,

09:30.337 --> 09:31.905
so will you come
 help me set the table?

09:31.972 --> 09:33.073
- Because we are
 T-minus some--

09:33.140 --> 09:34.507
- Okay. Yeah.

09:34.574 --> 09:35.843
- Okay?
 - How was the dentist?

09:35.909 --> 09:37.611
I have, uh,
700 cavities.

09:37.678 --> 09:38.746
Oh.

10:04.237 --> 10:06.073
Look. Uh. Hey.

10:06.139 --> 10:08.876
Oh. Hello, beautiful people!

10:08.942 --> 10:10.811
- Hi.
- Hi. What's up?

10:10.878 --> 10:11.779
Wow.

10:11.845 --> 10:12.880
Hello, Buzz.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.147
- Wow.
- There you go.

10:14.214 --> 10:15.382
Look at this place.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.918
- Hey, kiddies--
 - You guys look hot.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.286
...we need a place
 to put our leathers.

10:19.352 --> 10:20.487
Yeah. Smokin'.

10:20.553 --> 10:22.222
Oh, yeah.
Hello, delicious.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.757
- Just give me your leathers.
 - All right.

10:23.824 --> 10:26.026
- Are those chaps?
 - Everything. Here.

10:26.093 --> 10:28.428
- He's wearing chaps?
 - Yes, he's wearing chaps.

10:28.495 --> 10:30.097
You guys need a mud room

10:30.163 --> 10:31.865
for sporty people
in your family

10:31.932 --> 10:33.500
who arrive with gear.

10:33.566 --> 10:34.601
We are not a people
 of the gear.

10:34.668 --> 10:35.769
We are now.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.470
I'm a real
California girl.

10:37.537 --> 10:39.606
- Let me kiss you.
 - All right.

10:39.673 --> 10:40.741
- I can handle it.

10:40.808 --> 10:41.875
- You sure?
- Yeah.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.076
I want to be
part of your tribe.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.112
Try swarm.

10:45.178 --> 10:47.547
You know, I'm fine
with that, too.

10:47.614 --> 10:48.982
Hmm.

10:49.049 --> 10:50.483
Hey, um,

10:50.550 --> 10:52.119
you got something
in your dress?

10:52.185 --> 10:53.754
Like what?

10:53.821 --> 10:55.889
Like an ass.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.825
Hmm.
 Must have been something

10:57.891 --> 10:59.927
they put in the shapewear
 that I bought.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.361
- Oh.
 - You like it?

11:01.428 --> 11:02.930
Yeah.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.264
Hello.

11:04.331 --> 11:05.766
- Hi.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.367
- Oh, the birthday
girl is here.

11:07.434 --> 11:08.769
Birthday girl is here.

11:08.836 --> 11:09.870
- Birthday girl present.

11:09.937 --> 11:11.104
How are you doing?

11:11.171 --> 11:12.873
- Hi.
 - Oh, my God.

11:12.940 --> 11:14.307
It looks beautiful.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.643
How are you?

11:16.710 --> 11:18.211
Doesn't she
 look fantastic?

11:18.278 --> 11:19.813
- Wow.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.248
- People are steppin' it up.
 - Fantastic.

11:21.314 --> 11:23.183
- Oh, my.
 - Wow, look at you.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.185
Is this a birthday
 makeover?

11:25.252 --> 11:27.154
It's an everything
 makeover.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.422
- You look beautiful.
 - As do you.

11:29.489 --> 11:30.758
You're so
 skinny-winnie.

11:30.824 --> 11:33.660
Wow. Look at you.

11:33.727 --> 11:37.497
My. We have
 the exact same haircut.

11:37.564 --> 11:38.732
No, I don't think so.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.734
Well-- No? Well, here.
 Let me get--

11:40.801 --> 11:42.169
- Hey, Shel.
 - Hi, darling.

11:42.235 --> 11:43.536
Real quick.
 Just real quick.

11:43.603 --> 11:44.872
Just you and me.
 We got it.

11:44.938 --> 11:47.540
Okay. Thank you.

11:47.607 --> 11:49.176
- Hello.
 - Hey, Len.

11:49.242 --> 11:50.610
Let's go, guys.

11:50.677 --> 11:52.712
Birthday, birthday.
Hey.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.051
Thank you.

11:58.118 --> 11:59.920
- This is for you.
 - Hi.

11:59.987 --> 12:01.454
- Hey, Len.
 - Hiya, Sarah.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.261
All right, all right.

12:08.328 --> 12:09.496
I'm sorry I spoke.
 Never mind.

12:09.562 --> 12:10.630
- Dame Helen Mirren.
 - Excuse me.

12:10.697 --> 12:11.932
- Come on in.
 - Okay.

12:11.999 --> 12:14.001
Oh, that's really like--

12:14.067 --> 12:15.969
- There's cheese.
- Oh, goodness gracious.

12:16.036 --> 12:17.971
- Hey, Ali.
- Look at this.

12:18.038 --> 12:19.506
Look at how much
 cheese there is.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.508
- Um, who's that?
 - Hey, babe, smell.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.710
That's Shea, Moppa's friend.
 You never met her?

12:23.777 --> 12:25.879
- Oh, definitely not.
 - She's great.

12:25.946 --> 12:28.115
Go look at this.
 This is the real--

12:28.181 --> 12:29.917
Why is the kitchen

12:29.983 --> 12:32.585
always the most crowded
place at the party?

12:32.652 --> 12:35.188
You looking for anybody
 in a party, check the kitchen.

12:35.255 --> 12:38.358
The kitchen is
 the heart of the home.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.527
Babe, you should write
that down for the show.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.262
- No, no, no.
 I have to try to--
 - What show?

12:42.329 --> 12:44.331
...post the photo between
 me and Maura on Twitter.

12:44.397 --> 12:45.565
Hold it, hold it.
 Please. Hello?

12:45.632 --> 12:46.900
Yes?

12:46.967 --> 12:49.669
Do not post my picture
on that machine

12:49.736 --> 12:51.104
because there'll
be ex-students

12:51.171 --> 12:53.073
who'll be Twitting
 about me. Thank you.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.975
You have nothing
 to worry about
 privacy-wise, Maura.

12:55.042 --> 12:57.410
I don't post
 under my real name.

12:57.477 --> 13:00.280
I don't need burglars and
 rapists knowing where I am.

13:00.347 --> 13:01.882
You live in a gated
community, Mom.

13:01.949 --> 13:03.416
Well, haven't you heard
of inside jobs?

13:03.483 --> 13:04.918
That is such a good point.

13:04.985 --> 13:07.687
Oh, oh, oh.
 I have 13 followers.

13:07.754 --> 13:09.957
Who here is on social? Hmm?

13:10.023 --> 13:12.893
Show of hands. Come on.

13:12.960 --> 13:16.163
Oh, see?
 Now you can follow me.

13:16.229 --> 13:19.566
Okay. Who here wants to know
 my social media name?

13:20.800 --> 13:21.734
Wait for it.

13:21.801 --> 13:22.936
I'm dying.

13:23.003 --> 13:26.273
It's To Shel And Back.

13:26.339 --> 13:28.175
- Ha ha!
 - I get it.

13:28.241 --> 13:29.442
It's like
"To hell and back."

13:29.509 --> 13:30.410
Yes.

13:32.279 --> 13:35.215
I, too, have transitioned.

13:37.885 --> 13:39.586
I'm coming out.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.421
I'm reaching out.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.191
I'm a brand.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.229
Does anybody want
 some orzo?

13:49.296 --> 13:50.497
There's, like,
 15 tons of orzo.

13:50.563 --> 13:51.531
There's a lot of orzo.

13:51.598 --> 13:53.166
Hey, no towel whipping.

13:54.801 --> 13:56.469
Did you raise
all the kids here?

13:56.536 --> 13:57.670
It's such an amazing
 property.

13:57.737 --> 13:58.972
- Yeah.
- Isn't it nice?

13:59.039 --> 14:00.640
- Isn't it lovely?
- It's beautiful.

14:00.707 --> 14:02.109
No. This is the living room.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.543
They just-- I don't--

14:03.610 --> 14:05.278
Is the dining room--
 Is this permanent?

14:05.345 --> 14:06.914
It's just been
 in this iteration

14:06.980 --> 14:08.181
for the last day
 because of this party, but--

14:08.248 --> 14:09.883
Did you say
"in this iteration"?

14:09.950 --> 14:11.418
Yeah, we're playing
 around with the space.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.086
- Yeah.
 We're rejiggering.

14:13.153 --> 14:14.554
- Rejiggering?
 - We're doing a lot of stuff.

14:14.621 --> 14:17.090
Sarah, Sarah, I just
 want to apologize

14:17.157 --> 14:18.858
for what happened
at the temple.

14:18.926 --> 14:20.760
Buzzy, it's fine. I'm fine,
 actually. I'm fine.

14:20.827 --> 14:22.095
- Are you?
 - Yeah, I'm totally fine.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.331
- Are you?
 - Yeah. I'm fine.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.299
What? What's going on?
 What are you talking about?

14:26.366 --> 14:28.235
You guys judging me?
 That is absurd.

14:28.301 --> 14:29.536
No one's judging you.

14:29.602 --> 14:30.971
No, I mean,
 there was a vote at--

14:31.038 --> 14:32.072
I was trying to get
 on the board.

14:32.139 --> 14:33.773
You didn't get on?

14:33.840 --> 14:35.475
No, I did not.
I'm persona au gratin.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.510
Wait a minute.
 You wouldn't have helped?

14:37.577 --> 14:39.012
I had to recuse myself.

14:39.079 --> 14:40.580
What do you mean, recuse?
 Recuse?

14:40.647 --> 14:42.515
I didn't vote because
 of my relationship

14:42.582 --> 14:43.883
with you and Sarah.

14:43.951 --> 14:44.985
Oh, this is bullshit.

14:45.052 --> 14:46.219
Cut him some slack.

14:46.286 --> 14:47.387
- Excuse me.
 - No, no, no.

14:47.454 --> 14:48.821
He's a macher at the temple,

14:48.888 --> 14:50.290
and he could have
 done something,

14:50.357 --> 14:51.558
- and he didn't do it.

14:51.624 --> 14:52.859
I'm really disappointed.

14:58.698 --> 14:59.967
I'd like to propose a toast.

15:01.969 --> 15:04.504
As I look at this, uh, table

15:04.571 --> 15:06.406
in this-- in this room

15:06.473 --> 15:09.542
that I-- I don't remember
 having such high ceilings...

15:10.743 --> 15:12.112
and goyische lights.

15:12.179 --> 15:14.847
- I just am so moved,

15:14.914 --> 15:19.219
and I am so grateful to be
 celebrating my 70th birthday

15:19.286 --> 15:21.321
with my family...

15:22.956 --> 15:24.992
and my chosen family.

15:26.994 --> 15:28.228
L'chaim.

15:28.295 --> 15:29.662
- L'chaim.
 - L'chaim.

15:29.729 --> 15:30.797
Happy birthday.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.968
I guess that would make us
 the not-chosen family.

15:39.306 --> 15:40.707
- No.
- Hold on. Let me
just look a little.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.675
- No, you can't look at all.
 - Let me read it.

15:42.742 --> 15:44.777
Literally, this is the worst
 sermon I have ever written.

15:44.844 --> 15:46.479
Please, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

15:46.546 --> 15:48.015
- Respectfully--
 - I'm hiding-- No.

15:48.081 --> 15:49.349
- Come on.
 - I'm putting this somewhere.

15:49.416 --> 15:50.984
I'm going to pretend
 that this never happened.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.952
I'll put it
 right under here. Okay?

15:53.020 --> 15:55.255
Come on. Look,
 you're a great writer.

15:55.322 --> 15:57.524
You're one of my-- one
of my favorite writers.

15:57.590 --> 15:58.858
- I'm not-- No, you think--

15:58.925 --> 16:00.260
You think I'm joking.

16:00.327 --> 16:01.828
I have been working
 so hard on this thing,

16:01.894 --> 16:02.862
and I'm telling you,
 nothing's--

16:02.929 --> 16:03.997
nothing's sticking.

16:04.064 --> 16:05.265
It's so bad.

16:05.332 --> 16:06.733
It's nothing I believe in.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.001
What, the Passover stuff?

16:08.068 --> 16:09.936
Yeah, Passover stuff, the G--

16:10.003 --> 16:11.671
you know, the God stuff.

16:24.384 --> 16:25.552
So...

16:27.087 --> 16:29.289
I mean, do you feel it?

16:29.356 --> 16:31.191
The presence of the divine?

16:31.258 --> 16:32.825
Do you feel it all the time?

16:32.892 --> 16:34.861
Remember the four words.
 Uh...

16:34.927 --> 16:36.163
Yes, Rebbe.

16:36.229 --> 16:37.730
Picture them
 out in the world.

16:37.797 --> 16:41.468
I picture love,
 justice, truth, beauty.

16:41.534 --> 16:42.969
I remember them,
 and it's physical.

16:43.036 --> 16:44.204
I remember them around me,

16:44.271 --> 16:46.573
and I picture them
 wrapping me up like a--

16:46.639 --> 16:47.840
- Okay.
 - ...like a garment

16:47.907 --> 16:49.242
that I try on.

16:49.309 --> 16:51.311
I feel a little rush,
 and, you know,

16:51.378 --> 16:53.380
you get sort of a tingle
 on the back of your neck.

16:53.446 --> 16:55.082
Sometimes
 that's all God is--

16:55.148 --> 16:57.217
is that-- the feeling,

16:57.284 --> 17:01.054
and from that place,
 I feel like I can love.

17:31.218 --> 17:33.052
I had a miscarriage.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.657
Then I didn't know, uh--

17:39.192 --> 17:40.627
I didn't ex-expect it

17:40.693 --> 17:43.830
to gut me like it did.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.601
Because it g-- it gutted me.

17:52.339 --> 17:53.740
And now I think I'm--

17:58.245 --> 18:00.480
really depressed.

18:19.732 --> 18:21.601
Make a wish, Cha-cha!

18:27.774 --> 18:30.343
- 70-year-old lungs.
 - What did you wish?

18:30.410 --> 18:32.845
Well, one of the things
I wished for

18:32.912 --> 18:35.382
was, uh, that you guys
 don't call me Moppa anymore.

18:35.448 --> 18:36.416
- Really?
 - Why?

18:36.483 --> 18:37.550
You don't like that name?

18:37.617 --> 18:39.018
I thought you liked
that name.

18:39.085 --> 18:40.987
I did.
 I just want to move away

18:41.053 --> 18:43.723
from Flopsy, Mopsy,
 huggable--

18:43.790 --> 18:45.024
- Yeah.
- Like a Muppet.

18:45.091 --> 18:46.593
What do you want us
to call you?

18:46.659 --> 18:47.627
- How about Guh-guh?
 - Ugh.

18:47.694 --> 18:49.496
That's more muppety
than Moppa.

18:49.562 --> 18:50.897
It's too close to mine.
I'm Gigi.

18:50.963 --> 18:51.931
What about Mimi?

18:51.998 --> 18:52.999
What about Nana?

18:53.065 --> 18:54.301
I don't like Nana.

18:54.367 --> 18:55.835
Can we call you Grammie?

18:55.902 --> 18:57.837
Hold on. Not Grammie.

18:57.904 --> 18:59.706
- Grandma?
- Grandma. See?

18:59.772 --> 19:01.808
- G-R-A-N-D-M-A?
- Yes.

19:01.874 --> 19:05.545
Well done. And, uh, maybe
 you guys want to call me,

19:05.612 --> 19:07.680
I don't know, Mom.

19:12.652 --> 19:13.686
- Mom?

19:13.753 --> 19:15.888
Ha ha! Get a load of this.

19:17.557 --> 19:18.558
Mom.

19:18.625 --> 19:21.060
- Mm, okay.
 - Why not?

19:21.127 --> 19:22.462
Well, I mean were you there

19:22.529 --> 19:24.096
when Sarie got
 her period? Hmm?

19:24.163 --> 19:25.932
Did you slap her
across the face

19:25.998 --> 19:27.834
like a good Jewish mother?
 Were you th--

19:27.900 --> 19:29.168
Did you show her
 how to put her tampon in?

19:29.236 --> 19:30.570
- Mom, the kids are here.
 - Please, Mom.

19:30.637 --> 19:32.739
- I've seen her tampons.
- Oh, please.

19:32.805 --> 19:34.173
- You know what?

19:34.241 --> 19:36.175
- While we're at it,

19:36.243 --> 19:37.644
I've been on the internet.

19:39.279 --> 19:41.648
I've been, uh, Googling
 the, uh,

19:41.714 --> 19:43.850
best doctors
 in Los Angeles,

19:43.916 --> 19:45.184
and there's something, um--

19:45.252 --> 19:47.254
I think I would like
 to start, um...

19:49.155 --> 19:50.457
transitioning...

19:51.558 --> 19:52.492
medically.

19:52.559 --> 19:54.661
- Hmm?
 - Wow.

19:54.727 --> 19:56.663
It's something I want to do.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.130
You understand
what I'm saying?

19:58.197 --> 19:59.466
- Yeah.
 - I'm saying surgery.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.768
What kind of surgery?

20:01.834 --> 20:03.870
Face, breasts, vagina.

20:03.936 --> 20:05.438
- Oh.
 - Wow.

20:05.505 --> 20:07.039
Okay, do you guys want
to go play hide and seek?

20:07.106 --> 20:08.675
- You guys
 want to go outside?
 - Yeah! Yeah!

20:08.741 --> 20:09.642
Sardines!
 Let's play sardines!

20:09.709 --> 20:11.511
- Fantastic.
- Sardines! Now!

20:11.578 --> 20:12.879
- When did you--
- That's right.

20:12.945 --> 20:14.814
- Do you know
 how to play sardines?

20:14.881 --> 20:16.449
That's amazing. Isn't
 that amazing, Vicki?

20:16.516 --> 20:17.817
- Yeah.
 - Thank you.

20:17.884 --> 20:21.288
So, uh, tell us more
about your sex change.

20:21.354 --> 20:23.556
It's gender
 confirmation surgery,

20:23.623 --> 20:24.857
Shelly.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.659
- You understand, Shelly?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.060
You okay?

20:28.127 --> 20:29.929
It's something
 I want to do.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.298
And I would love your support,

20:31.364 --> 20:32.932
but if you can't,
 I totally understand,

20:32.999 --> 20:34.901
- but, uh...
 - We got you.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.603
We totally support you.

20:36.669 --> 20:38.738
Of course
 we support you. Right?

20:38.805 --> 20:39.972
We support you.

20:40.039 --> 20:41.874
I'm gonna go help the kids

20:41.941 --> 20:44.411
look for some hiding places
 for their game.

20:44.477 --> 20:47.213
- Congratulations.
 - Thanks, Buzz.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.784
- Was that Latin?

20:51.851 --> 20:53.620
What did he say?
 I don't know what he said.

20:53.686 --> 20:57.524
It means in Yiddish
 "Wear it in good health."

20:57.590 --> 20:59.626
- Wear it well.
- He will.

20:59.692 --> 21:01.661
Yeah. Uh, would anyone
 like coffee?

21:01.728 --> 21:03.062
Yeah. I'll help you.

21:03.129 --> 21:04.764
- Coffee?
- We're with you, girl.

21:04.831 --> 21:06.333
- Okay.
 - We're with you.

21:13.906 --> 21:15.308
Just give me a minute.

21:18.010 --> 21:18.978
Okay.

21:26.619 --> 21:27.954
Oi.

21:32.392 --> 21:33.626
Okay.

21:36.195 --> 21:38.197
Okay.

21:38.264 --> 21:39.632
- Len,
 what's the difference

21:39.699 --> 21:41.200
between hide and seek
 and sardines?

21:41.267 --> 21:43.069
Still working.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.738
- Instead of everyone
 hiding, one person looking,

21:45.805 --> 21:48.541
one person hides,
 and everyone else seeks.

21:48.608 --> 21:49.976
- You all right?

21:54.213 --> 21:55.748
Mm-hmm.

21:55.815 --> 21:56.883
Definitely.

22:05.358 --> 22:06.659
Thank you.

22:10.262 --> 22:11.631
Happy birthday.

22:40.460 --> 22:44.564
- 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

22:44.631 --> 22:46.566
- Stakeout!

22:46.633 --> 22:47.700
Look out!

22:53.940 --> 22:56.342
- Get out of my yard!
 - Jesus Christ.

22:56.409 --> 22:57.309
Jesus, Len.

23:01.614 --> 23:02.381
- Daddy.
 - Where'd they go?

23:02.449 --> 23:03.450
Where'd they go?

23:04.951 --> 23:06.018
Go! Go! Go! Go!

23:08.387 --> 23:10.156
Round 9.
 Who's going to hide?

23:10.222 --> 23:11.323
- Me!
 - Me!
 - Me!

23:11.390 --> 23:12.291
All right, ready? Go!

23:12.358 --> 23:13.159
- Come on.

23:14.961 --> 23:16.663
I just don't want them
 to change her face.

23:16.729 --> 23:20.533
I love her face.
 I like her mouth.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.134
Yeah, but it's not
like she's

23:22.201 --> 23:23.436
a Beverly Hills
 housewife, you know?

23:23.503 --> 23:25.137
She just wants
 to feel beautiful.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.441
I think I'm okay
with the face.

23:28.508 --> 23:30.977
Ahem. Just...

23:31.043 --> 23:34.080
the idea of Dad's pussy.

23:36.048 --> 23:37.917
Dad's pussy.

23:39.652 --> 23:41.688
Dad's pussy.

23:41.754 --> 23:43.189
Where's Mom hiding?

23:43.255 --> 23:44.557
Shh, shh. Shh.

23:44.624 --> 23:46.793
I hear Munchkins.

23:52.131 --> 23:54.033
This is a great spot.

23:59.305 --> 24:00.206
I'm not playing.

24:10.282 --> 24:11.183
I'm not playing.

24:11.250 --> 24:12.519
Come on.

24:14.721 --> 24:17.624
Your family's the best,
I love your family.

24:17.690 --> 24:20.292
I mean, they're crazy,
 but I love them.

24:20.359 --> 24:21.393
Hmm.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.029
You okay?

24:23.095 --> 24:25.097
Yeah. Will you put
 your arm around me?

24:28.400 --> 24:30.102
- You're good?
 - Yeah.

24:31.971 --> 24:33.706
Can I just ask you something?

24:33.773 --> 24:36.008
I just-- I just want to--
 just want to know her--

24:36.075 --> 24:37.076
What's her name?

24:39.612 --> 24:41.413
I like how you wait
till we're trapped together

24:41.480 --> 24:42.549
to ask me this shit.

24:43.716 --> 24:45.117
You don't know her.

24:45.184 --> 24:47.019
I don't know her?

24:47.086 --> 24:48.755
Her name's Una.

24:50.857 --> 24:53.125
Una? Una?

24:53.192 --> 24:54.961
Wait a second. Una is--

24:55.027 --> 24:57.329
Wait.
 The spin instructor Una?

24:57.396 --> 24:58.998
Come here. Back this way.

24:59.065 --> 25:00.567
- This way.
 - Kids, this way.

25:01.901 --> 25:03.102
I mean, honestly,

25:03.169 --> 25:04.771
does it really
 matter how I feel?

25:04.837 --> 25:06.906
I mean, it's like
 she's got to do her.

25:08.374 --> 25:10.442
Yeah, she does.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.378
I'm proud of her.

25:12.444 --> 25:13.580
Yeah. Me, too.

25:13.646 --> 25:15.047
You know? It's not easy.

25:15.114 --> 25:16.415
So you guys--

25:16.482 --> 25:17.617
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

25:17.684 --> 25:18.918
Used to be roommates?

25:18.985 --> 25:22.488
Yeah. I finally have
 my own spot.

25:22.555 --> 25:24.056
It's good.
 I switched out my job.

25:24.123 --> 25:26.425
The money's
 a little better, so...

25:26.492 --> 25:27.860
you know.

25:28.895 --> 25:30.563
What?

25:33.132 --> 25:35.768
Uh, where-- where--
 where are you working now?

25:37.570 --> 25:38.738
Silver Reign.

25:38.805 --> 25:40.039
Silver Reign Silver Reign?

25:40.106 --> 25:42.474
Silver Reign
 Silver Reign.

25:42.541 --> 25:45.945
You-- You strip?

25:46.012 --> 25:49.481
No. Actually, I'm
 the Silver Reign IT person.

25:49.548 --> 25:52.451
Shut the fuck up.

25:54.954 --> 25:56.889
Oh, sweetie, I'm not playing.

26:05.632 --> 26:06.599
Do you want to go?

26:06.666 --> 26:08.067
Why would you wait
to speak

26:08.134 --> 26:10.102
before an audience
of all these people

26:10.169 --> 26:11.203
about your surgery?

26:14.373 --> 26:16.108
- They're my family. I mean--
 - I mean--

26:16.175 --> 26:17.343
...of course I'm going
 to talk to them.

26:17.409 --> 26:18.645
It didn't occur to you

26:18.711 --> 26:20.713
to talk to me
about this first?

26:20.780 --> 26:22.715
- What's going on?
- I'd just like to know

26:22.782 --> 26:26.819
what it is about you
 that needs an audience

26:26.886 --> 26:27.987
for this kind of thing,

26:28.054 --> 26:29.555
why you can't say
 to me--

26:29.622 --> 26:30.923
It's my family.

26:30.990 --> 26:32.391
...at home
 before we leave,

26:32.458 --> 26:34.160
in the car
 on the way up here--

26:34.226 --> 26:35.728
Oh, by the way, honey,
 I'm thinking about this.

26:35.795 --> 26:37.563
I did not know
I was going to say it

26:37.630 --> 26:38.965
until I said it.

26:40.399 --> 26:42.168
Hey.
 I'll tell you what.

26:42.234 --> 26:44.003
Let's go home
 because this is stupid.

26:44.070 --> 26:45.504
I'm ready.

26:45.571 --> 26:46.973
- Oh, sorry. Not playing?
 - Come on in.

26:47.039 --> 26:48.140
- Sorry. Hi.
 - Shh.

26:48.207 --> 26:49.676
Come on in.
 Come on, come on.

26:49.742 --> 26:51.410
- Come on, come on.

26:51.477 --> 26:52.344
- Shh.
- Come on, come on,

26:52.411 --> 26:53.680
come on, come on.

26:53.746 --> 26:55.081
Okay, everybody here?

26:55.147 --> 26:56.282
- Yeah.

26:56.348 --> 26:57.583
- Shh.

26:57.650 --> 26:59.585
- Okay.
Now turn off the lights.

26:59.652 --> 27:00.820
Yeah.

27:02.722 --> 27:04.824
Those fuckers
 at the temple.

27:04.891 --> 27:09.328
Do you remember how I used
 to try out for everything

27:09.395 --> 27:10.897
and no one ever wanted me?

27:10.963 --> 27:13.465
I mean, I-- I--
 I tried out for band.

27:13.532 --> 27:15.334
I tried out
 for cheerleading.

27:15.401 --> 27:18.437
I-- I tried out with that--
 the thing with the--

27:18.504 --> 27:19.571
Rhythmic gymnastics?

27:19.638 --> 27:20.940
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

27:21.007 --> 27:22.809
Why the fuck
do I know that?

27:24.076 --> 27:26.278
- Okay, first of all,

27:26.345 --> 27:29.381
people want you,
 and whatever, I'm alone.

27:29.448 --> 27:31.117
- So what's the big deal?
 - Oh, really?

27:31.183 --> 27:32.484
- Yeah.
 - Really?

27:32.551 --> 27:34.586
- Yeah.
- Who do you live with?

27:34.653 --> 27:36.055
What's going on
 upstairs?

27:36.122 --> 27:38.557
You're fucking
 baking cakes, okay?

27:38.624 --> 27:40.592
- That's not the same.
 - It is.

27:40.659 --> 27:41.994
You and Josh
 are like a married--

27:42.061 --> 27:43.095
And he was mine,
 by the way.

27:43.162 --> 27:44.831
You fucking
 stole him from me

27:44.897 --> 27:46.165
the second you were born.

27:46.232 --> 27:47.633
He was mine.

27:47.700 --> 27:49.401
That is--

27:52.071 --> 27:53.105
Whatever.

27:58.811 --> 28:00.646
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

28:00.713 --> 28:02.248
- What? What?
 - There's something
 over there.

28:02.314 --> 28:03.415
- Oh!
 - Aah!

28:03.482 --> 28:04.650
Oh, yeah!

28:04.717 --> 28:05.852
What is it? What is it?

28:05.918 --> 28:07.686
What is that? Holy shit.

28:07.754 --> 28:09.088
Aah! Oh, God!

28:09.155 --> 28:10.622
Jesus Christ, it's alive.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.158
It's alive. It's--

28:12.224 --> 28:15.594
Wait. Is that a--
 Is that a turtle?

28:15.661 --> 28:18.297
Wait. Didn't we used
 to have a turtle?

28:18.364 --> 28:19.598
Who are we missing?

28:19.665 --> 28:21.200
- Ali.
 - Sarah's not here.

28:21.267 --> 28:22.902
- Shh, shh, shh.
- Let's just go.

28:22.969 --> 28:25.504
- Aah!
 - Shh!

28:25.571 --> 28:27.473
- What's going on?
 - What is this?

28:27.539 --> 28:28.607
- What is that?
- What is that?

28:28.674 --> 28:30.109
Look at it.

28:30.176 --> 28:32.344
- It's a turtle.

28:32.411 --> 28:34.013
- Oh, my God.

28:34.080 --> 28:36.983
Oh, my God. It's-- It's Nacho.

28:37.049 --> 28:38.150
- That's awesome.

28:38.217 --> 28:39.786
It was our pet
when we were young.

28:39.852 --> 28:41.553
It's 30 years old.

28:41.620 --> 28:43.655
- Oh, my God.
 - Mommy, can we take him home?

28:43.722 --> 28:44.824
Dude.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.260
Dude.

28:50.396 --> 28:52.799
He's huge and ancient.

28:52.865 --> 28:54.066
Oh, my Gosh.

28:54.133 --> 28:55.567
Oh, my God.
