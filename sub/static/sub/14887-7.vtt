meet her in person.

She's with Mr. Burns right now.

When they're finished I have
to drive her to the airport.

02:05.400 --> 02:07.566

You get to spend rush hour

Get out of the city.

Balki, I can't tell the future,
and neither can she.

02:22.166 --> 02:25.133
She just flies in once a year
makes some guesses about

02:25.166 --> 02:28.300
the future and this newspaper
pays her tons of money for it.

02:28.333 --> 02:30.500
Well, if they're just guesses
they're pretty good.

Sean Penn would do time.

could have predicted that.

how much I wanted to drive you

03:27.766 --> 03:30.333

to put this edition to bed.

It was nice seeing
you again, Harry.

03:32.700 --> 03:33.733
See you next year, Claire.

you said?

pick up something

about the owners of the objects.

Is this your pen?

05:28.700 --> 05:30.033
No.

05:30.066 --> 05:33.333
This pen belonged
to my Cousin Larry.

Well, I hope
I predicted good things.

to go now, my car's ready.

13:00.625 --> 13:03.725
No, cousin!
No, no, no, no!

13:06.559 --> 13:09.625
We just got Balki's message
on our answering machine.

13:09.659 --> 13:11.125
Larry, I can't believe it.

13:11.159 --> 13:13.159
I didn't even know
you were sick.

13:13.192 --> 13:16.259
There so much
we should've talked about.

13:16.292 --> 13:19.592
There so much
we should've done.

13:19.625 --> 13:21.225
Well, we still have
a little time.

13:24.525 --> 13:26.725
Uh, oh, well, uh...

13:26.759 --> 13:28.759
No, look,
I'm‐I'm not sick at all

13:28.792 --> 13:31.259
and I'm definitely
not dying.

13:31.292 --> 13:33.125
Then what is this about?

13:33.159 --> 13:36.225
Jennifer... Mary Ann...

13:36.259 --> 13:39.359
...would you please try to
talk some sense into him?

13:39.392 --> 13:41.825
At the stroke of midnight
Mr. Death is going to come

13:41.859 --> 13:44.392
for Cousin Larry right
after he sits on a sheep

13:44.425 --> 13:46.125
and eats a golden ring.

13:47.525 --> 13:49.525
What is this really
all about?

13:49.559 --> 13:51.625
Balki met Claire Hayden
at the Paper.

13:51.659 --> 13:54.425
And she made these
crazy predictions about me.

13:54.459 --> 13:56.192
Oh, is that all it is?

13:56.225 --> 13:58.125
"Is that all it is?"

13:58.159 --> 13:59.825
Mr. Death is coming
for Cousin Larry

13:59.859 --> 14:01.225
and that's what you say?

14:01.259 --> 14:03.659
"Is that all it is?
Is that all it is?"

14:03.692 --> 14:06.259
Oh, God.
Now, I have a headache.

14:09.292 --> 14:12.092
What does it take
to impress you people?

14:14.892 --> 14:16.592
I'm impressed.

14:16.625 --> 14:19.092
Finally, a rational person.

14:20.159 --> 14:22.492
Look, there's
an easy way to prove

14:22.525 --> 14:24.792
that all of this
is just nonsense.

14:26.125 --> 14:28.259
I'll call Pioli's.
We'll order pizza.

14:28.292 --> 14:30.125
Then we'll wait till midnight.

14:30.159 --> 14:32.292
If Mr. Death shows up

14:32.325 --> 14:34.392
I'll admit I'm wrong.

14:34.425 --> 14:36.225
[dramatic music]

14:39.225 --> 14:40.192
[thunder rumbling]

14:43.759 --> 14:45.325
How much longer?

14:45.359 --> 14:47.359
Five minutes 'til midnight.

14:49.692 --> 14:52.625
Alright, what's the
name of the game?

14:52.659 --> 14:54.325
Gin.

14:54.359 --> 14:56.592
I'm unbeatable.
I should be doomed every night.

15:01.125 --> 15:02.192
What is that?

15:02.225 --> 15:03.692
Myposian death repellent.

15:06.559 --> 15:08.859
A little dab will do you.

15:08.892 --> 15:10.825
It smells terrible!

15:10.859 --> 15:13.292
But cousin,
that's how we think it works.

15:13.325 --> 15:14.559
It makes you smell so bad...

15:18.625 --> 15:21.059
...that Mr. Death
don't want to get near you.

15:22.892 --> 15:24.359
It's working on me.

15:28.392 --> 15:29.725
Death repellent?

15:30.692 --> 15:32.659
I can't believe
grown people

15:32.692 --> 15:34.759
buy into
such hocus‐pocus.

15:34.792 --> 15:36.525
Cousin, we're running
out of time.

15:36.559 --> 15:37.659
If we don't do
something soon

15:37.692 --> 15:40.559
Mr. Death is going to come
in here and kick your bucket.

15:42.392 --> 15:44.392
Hey, here I am,
Mr. Death!

15:44.425 --> 15:45.725
Come and get me!

15:45.759 --> 15:46.825
[thunder rumbling]

15:49.825 --> 15:54.559
Oh, Balki, will you get away
from me with that stuff?

15:54.592 --> 15:57.359
Look, look,
it's almost midnight.

15:57.392 --> 15:58.459
I think I can get
through the next‐‐

15:58.492 --> 15:59.625
Four minutes.

15:59.659 --> 16:01.692
Four minutes without
sitting on a sheep

16:01.725 --> 16:03.492
and eating a golden ring.

16:04.492 --> 16:06.125
Maybe Larry's right.

16:06.159 --> 16:09.459
Now, why don't we have some
coffee and something to eat

16:09.492 --> 16:11.759
and try to relax.

16:11.792 --> 16:12.859
[thunder rumbling]

16:12.892 --> 16:14.225
Aah!

16:14.259 --> 16:15.192
Sorry, Larry.

16:15.225 --> 16:16.159
Let's have something to eat.
We'll have coffee.

16:16.192 --> 16:20.492
Yes, why‐why don't we
just try to remain calm.

16:20.525 --> 16:22.225
Right.

16:22.259 --> 16:24.125
Alright, now, it's just...

16:24.159 --> 16:26.692
‐ Three minutes.
‐ Three minutes 'til midnight.

16:26.725 --> 16:30.425
Let's just sit down
and not get crazy.

16:31.359 --> 16:33.659
I mean, come on people.

16:35.159 --> 16:38.659
You look like you're going
to somebody's funeral.

16:38.692 --> 16:41.092
Oops!

16:41.125 --> 16:42.692
I said the f‐word.

16:46.425 --> 16:47.392
Ohh!

16:49.259 --> 16:51.392
Ooh.
What's this?

16:51.425 --> 16:52.392
Aah!

16:54.892 --> 16:56.392
You sat on a sheep!

16:58.425 --> 17:00.859
Mr. Death is probably
on the stairs by now.

17:00.892 --> 17:02.725
It's a, it's not a sheep,
it's a toy.

17:02.759 --> 17:04.625
‐ This doesn't count, does it?
‐ I‐I don't know.

17:04.659 --> 17:07.092
Balki, did she say
it had to be a real sheep?

17:08.625 --> 17:10.492
Why did you have sit
on Dimitri?

17:10.525 --> 17:13.092
Why didn't you get out of town
while you had the chance?

17:13.125 --> 17:14.625
Alright, Balki, Balki!

17:14.659 --> 17:16.592
You're going to kill me
before Mr. Death gets here.

17:16.625 --> 17:19.724
‐ Oh... I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
‐ Alright.

17:19.759 --> 17:22.159
So I sat on a sheep.

17:22.192 --> 17:24.724
One of Claire Hayden's
predictions came true.

17:24.759 --> 17:26.525
[thunder rumbling]

17:26.559 --> 17:28.692
Alright... two.

17:31.625 --> 17:32.625
Aah!

17:34.692 --> 17:37.325
You ate the golden ring.

17:37.359 --> 17:39.092
[spitting]

17:39.125 --> 17:40.659
[choking]

17:44.725 --> 17:46.525
‐ I'm alright.
‐ Cousin, are you alright?

17:46.559 --> 17:48.725
‐ Are you okay? Are you okay?
‐ Yes. I'm fine.

17:48.759 --> 17:49.759
You're okay.

17:49.792 --> 17:51.692
Why did you eat
the golden ring?

17:51.725 --> 17:54.292
Now, three of the predictions
have come true.

17:54.325 --> 17:55.692
10 seconds till midnight.

17:55.725 --> 17:58.159
It's not a golden ring.
It's a doughnut.

17:58.192 --> 17:59.692
‐ What kind of doughnut?
‐ Five seconds.

17:59.725 --> 18:01.192
A golden doughnut!

18:01.225 --> 18:03.192
‐ Four, three...
‐ Oh, no.

18:03.225 --> 18:05.825
‐ Oh, no. No, no, no.
‐ Two, one.

18:05.859 --> 18:07.792
[screaming]

18:12.759 --> 18:13.725
Wait!

18:16.492 --> 18:19.359
It's after midnight.

18:19.392 --> 18:21.292
Are‐are you dead?

18:24.659 --> 18:26.259
No.

18:26.292 --> 18:28.459
‐ No. I'm alive. I'm alive!
‐ Oh, cousin's alive.

18:28.492 --> 18:29.659
Oh, yay!

18:29.692 --> 18:32.492
Oh... oh, good!

18:32.525 --> 18:34.459
[gasping]

18:36.692 --> 18:38.259
Boy, nothing like
a little terror

18:38.292 --> 18:39.792
to get your
heart started.

18:41.792 --> 18:43.625
I'm really glad
you're alright, Larry.

18:43.659 --> 18:44.625
Well...

18:45.659 --> 18:46.625
[sniffs]

18:47.892 --> 18:49.092
I'll see you tomorrow.

18:55.392 --> 18:57.625
Good night, Balki.
I had a wonderful evening.

18:57.659 --> 18:59.459
Except for the screaming part.

19:00.892 --> 19:02.359
I'm glad you're alive.

19:03.392 --> 19:04.392
Thank you.

19:04.425 --> 19:06.259
‐ Bye‐bye.
‐ Bye.

19:12.825 --> 19:14.859
Boy...

19:14.892 --> 19:17.592
I just can't believe
you're not dead.

19:21.392 --> 19:23.492
You know, Balki,
it's coincidences like those

19:23.525 --> 19:24.692
that happened here tonight

19:24.725 --> 19:27.792
that cause primitive cultures
to believe superstitions.

19:30.125 --> 19:33.725
Well, what do you say
we get some sleep? Hmh.

19:33.759 --> 19:35.325
We gotta get up
early tomorrow.

19:35.359 --> 19:38.792
And, uh, it's almost midnight.
Hmh.

19:43.792 --> 19:45.359
Did you said almost midnight?

19:45.392 --> 19:47.359
Mary Ann's watch
must have been fast.

19:47.392 --> 19:49.159
Let's call the time lady.

19:49.192 --> 19:51.125
[knock on door]

19:52.359 --> 19:53.759
He's here.

19:55.525 --> 19:58.292
Wait, wait, wait. Why didn't
I think of this before?

19:58.325 --> 20:00.259
We just won't
answer the door.

20:00.292 --> 20:03.859
Mr. Death will think there's
no one home and he'll go away.

20:03.892 --> 20:05.225
[knocking continues]

20:05.259 --> 20:09.259
Cousin, it's Mr. Death,
not the Avon lady.

20:10.725 --> 20:13.559
[knocking continues]

20:13.592 --> 20:15.359
Alright.

20:15.392 --> 20:18.792
Alright,
I, I‐I know what I must do.

20:18.825 --> 20:21.192
I'll go to the door myself.

20:21.225 --> 20:23.425
Mr. Death will‐will take me.

20:23.459 --> 20:25.359
I'll tell him
I'm Larry Appleton.

20:26.659 --> 20:28.792
‐ No! No. No.
‐ Cou‐‐

20:28.825 --> 20:30.492
There's no Larry Appleton here!

20:30.525 --> 20:31.592
You've got the wrong address!

20:31.625 --> 20:32.692
Mr. Death...

20:32.725 --> 20:34.159
Mister...

20:34.192 --> 20:35.859
Mr. Death.

20:35.892 --> 20:39.325
Mr. Death.
Mr. Death.

20:39.359 --> 20:40.559
Oh, Mr. Death.

20:40.592 --> 20:43.092
‐ Oh, Mr. Death.
‐ No, no.

20:43.125 --> 20:44.825
[knocking continues]

20:44.859 --> 20:47.659
Mr. Death, Mr. Death.

20:47.692 --> 20:49.192
Mr. Death.

20:49.225 --> 20:51.192
[grunting]

20:59.859 --> 21:01.192
‐ Hi.
‐ Hi.

21:04.492 --> 21:06.559
I forgot my purse.

21:12.359 --> 21:13.625
Are you sure
you guys are alright?

21:13.659 --> 21:15.392
‐ Oh, sure.
‐ Never better.

21:15.425 --> 21:17.059
Really good.

21:19.259 --> 21:20.225
Bye.

21:28.692 --> 21:30.825
It, uh...

21:31.892 --> 21:33.125
It wasn't Mr. Death.

21:33.159 --> 21:34.659
No, no, no.

21:37.559 --> 21:39.659
It was, uh, Jennifer.

21:39.692 --> 21:41.559
Yes, yes, yes, it was.

21:43.259 --> 21:44.259
[chuckles]

21:46.459 --> 21:48.759
Mr. Death would have been...

21:49.692 --> 21:51.125
...less humiliating.

21:56.825 --> 21:59.725
‐ Far, far less humiliating.
‐ Less humiliating.

22:03.659 --> 22:05.592
[grunting]

22:09.625 --> 22:11.559
[instrumental music]

22:19.859 --> 22:22.392
You were really serious
about taking my place.

22:22.425 --> 22:25.625
Oh, well, it was only Jennifer.
It didn't matter.

22:25.659 --> 22:28.359
But y‐you, you didn't
know that.

22:28.392 --> 22:30.725
You thought
it was Mr. Death.

22:30.759 --> 22:33.192
You would have really
taken my place

22:33.225 --> 22:36.825
even though I...
made fun of you.

22:36.859 --> 22:38.392
Yes, you did do that.

22:39.559 --> 22:42.525
Even though I talked
down to you.

22:42.559 --> 22:44.125
Well, you always do that.

22:46.559 --> 22:48.525
Even though I laughed
in your face.

22:49.225 --> 22:50.559
Now, that hurt.

22:53.459 --> 22:56.592
I guess I don't say
this often enough but, uh...

23:00.159 --> 23:02.159
I'm glad you're my cousin.

23:08.359 --> 23:09.125
Well...

23:10.725 --> 23:13.325
Cousin, I'm glad
you're my cousin, too.

23:16.459 --> 23:19.692
Well, I don't think I'm gonna be
able to sleep tonight.

23:19.725 --> 23:21.425
Me neither.

23:21.459 --> 23:24.225
Well, let's watch
some TV and...

23:24.259 --> 23:25.525
...maybe we'll get sleepy.

23:27.592 --> 23:29.559
[theme from
"The Twilight Zone" plays]

23:32.459 --> 23:34.259
Well, that's enough for me.

23:35.125 --> 23:38.059
[instrumental music]

23:43.559 --> 23:46.325
[theme music]

24:03.559 --> 24:06.525
[music continues]
