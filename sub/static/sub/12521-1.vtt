his family on the Horunvendush Day...

01:36:53.725 --> 01:36:55.602
I'm sorry.

01:36:57.061 --> 01:36:59.109
I used to think Time was a thief...

01:37:00.148 --> 01:37:01.741
stealing everything I loved.

01:37:05.153 --> 01:37:08.032
But I see now that
you give before you take.

01:37:08.448 --> 01:37:10.325
And every day is a gift.

01:37:10.742 --> 01:37:13.746
Every hour, every minute, every second.

01:37:18.249 --> 01:37:19.250
TIME: Ah.

01:37:19.751 --> 01:37:21.469
The fallen soldier.

01:37:21.627 --> 01:37:23.254
I suppose you want me to fix it.

01:37:24.297 --> 01:37:25.423
No.

01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:26.842
I want you to have it.

01:37:31.929 --> 01:37:34.432
He used to say the only thing
worth doing...

01:37:34.599 --> 01:37:35.771
was what we do for others.

01:37:39.020 --> 01:37:40.442
I think he would have liked you.

01:37:41.272 --> 01:37:42.319
Hmm?

01:37:44.525 --> 01:37:47.153
It is said that Time
is a friend to no man.

01:37:49.697 --> 01:37:51.916
But I will remember you always.

01:37:53.951 --> 01:37:54.873
And please...

01:37:55.953 --> 01:37:57.045
do not come back.

01:38:04.295 --> 01:38:05.296
(PANTING) Alice.

01:38:05.671 --> 01:38:06.547
Oh, Alice.

01:38:06.672 --> 01:38:08.470
You simply must come and meet my family.

01:38:08.883 --> 01:38:11.056
After all, you are the very person

01:38:11.135 --> 01:38:12.512
who saved them, aren't you?

01:38:13.012 --> 01:38:15.811
We're going to have so much fun together.

01:38:22.313 --> 01:38:23.314
Oh.

01:38:26.192 --> 01:38:28.320
But, of course, you have
a family of your own...

01:38:28.778 --> 01:38:29.950
don't you?

01:38:31.489 --> 01:38:34.368
Very important thing, a family.

01:38:35.743 --> 01:38:37.495
You only get the one.

01:38:39.330 --> 01:38:41.503
Oh, Hatter.

01:38:41.666 --> 01:38:43.543
I fear I may never see you again.

01:38:46.671 --> 01:38:48.093
My dear Alice.

01:38:53.302 --> 01:38:55.350
In the gardens of memory...

01:38:58.182 --> 01:39:00.480
in the palace of dreams...

01:39:01.853 --> 01:39:04.652
that is where you and I will meet.

01:39:05.648 --> 01:39:07.946
But a dream is not reality.

01:39:13.573 --> 01:39:16.497
Who's to say which is which?

01:39:40.558 --> 01:39:42.151
You did it, Alice.

01:39:42.727 --> 01:39:44.320
An impossible thing.

01:39:45.146 --> 01:39:48.571
Not as impossible as saying
goodbye to you, my friends.

01:39:53.362 --> 01:39:54.739
Goodbye, Hatter.

01:40:05.833 --> 01:40:08.427
Goodbye, Alice.

01:40:15.092 --> 01:40:16.093
HAMISH: Now, please.

01:40:16.177 --> 01:40:17.599
The deed to your husband's ship.

01:40:18.221 --> 01:40:19.939
Just sign here...

01:40:20.431 --> 01:40:21.273
and the house is yours.

(SIGHS)

01:40:31.108 --> 01:40:32.109
Mr Harcourt...

01:40:32.527 --> 01:40:33.699
time is money.

01:40:35.613 --> 01:40:37.581
I'm afraid he most certainly is not.

01:40:38.658 --> 01:40:39.580
Alice!

01:40:40.034 --> 01:40:43.129
Time is many things, Hamish,
but he isn't money.

01:40:45.289 --> 01:40:46.506
Nor is he our enemy, Mother.

01:40:48.376 --> 01:40:49.468
Where did you come from?

01:40:50.169 --> 01:40:52.342
I walked right through the walls.

01:40:52.755 --> 01:40:54.052
- Poof!

I may not be able to change the past,

01:40:59.428 --> 01:41:00.554
but I can learn from it.

01:41:02.306 --> 01:41:03.558
Sign the papers, Mother.

01:41:04.016 --> 01:41:05.484
You want me to sign them?

01:41:13.150 --> 01:41:14.276
But what about the Wonder?

01:41:14.819 --> 01:41:16.821
It's just a ship. There's always another.

01:41:18.489 --> 01:41:20.662
But you are my mother,
and I only have one.

01:41:23.077 --> 01:41:24.420
So you've decided to be a clerk?

01:41:26.747 --> 01:41:28.294
I knew that you would.

01:41:28.708 --> 01:41:30.585
Headstrong or not.

You're not a nice man, Hamish.

01:41:41.345 --> 01:41:43.347
I'm glad my daughter didn't marry you.

01:41:47.643 --> 01:41:48.144
Mrs Kingsleigh.

01:41:48.519 --> 01:41:49.691
Mrs Kingsleigh! No, you can't!

01:41:50.104 --> 01:41:51.572
You can't! You can't!

01:41:52.523 --> 01:41:54.946
Alice can do whatever Alice chooses.

01:41:57.194 --> 01:41:58.867
And so can I.

01:42:00.698 --> 01:42:01.620
Good day.

Higher.

Perfect! Thank you, gentlemen.

01:42:37.234 --> 01:42:39.282
We'll run the Ascots
out of business in a year.

01:42:39.445 --> 01:42:40.571
Mother!

01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:47.412
A full cargo aboard, Captain.

01:42:47.578 --> 01:42:48.625
Shall we commence with

01:42:48.704 --> 01:42:50.206
Kingsleigh and Kingsleigh's maiden voyage?

01:42:50.373 --> 01:42:53.377
Time and tide wait for no man,
Mr Harcourt.

01:42:53.542 --> 01:42:55.761
Or, indeed, woman.

01:42:57.129 --> 01:42:58.255

I know that I'm running out of time

I want it all
Mmm, mmm

01:43:33.082 --> 01:43:35.460
And I'm wishing they'd stop
trying to turn me off

01:43:35.543 --> 01:43:38.888
I want it on
Mmm, mmm

01:43:38.963 --> 01:43:41.887
And I'm walking on a wire
Trying to go higher

01:43:41.966 --> 01:43:45.220
Feels like I'm surrounded
by clowns and liars

01:43:45.302 --> 01:43:47.179
Even when I give it all away

01:43:47.263 --> 01:43:50.233
I want it all

for just one day

Watch this madness, colourful charade

No one can be just like me anyway

No one can be just like me anyway

we just go our different way
