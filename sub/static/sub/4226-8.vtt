Linda?

00:32.595 --> 00:34.297
Captain?

00:34.332 --> 00:36.232
You okay?

00:36.267 --> 00:37.434
I'm good.

00:37.469 --> 00:39.337
Colonel Porter's here.

00:39.371 --> 00:41.540
Send him in.

00:48.414 --> 00:50.682
Hey, Ben, you out here?!

00:50.716 --> 00:52.750
You're gonna miss lunch!

01:01.661 --> 01:03.696
Look at this.

01:03.731 --> 01:06.099
I remember when your idea
of exercising

01:06.133 --> 01:08.702
was reorganizing
dad's bookshelves.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.712
2 hours and 40 minutes?

01:17.746 --> 01:21.584
What, are you padding
your stats?

01:21.618 --> 01:23.185
Uh...

01:23.220 --> 01:26.356
M-must have hit the button
before I came out.

01:30.495 --> 01:32.296
Everything's
all right, huh?

01:32.330 --> 01:34.131
Yeah. Sure.

01:34.165 --> 01:37.335
Um...Let's eat.

01:50.482 --> 01:52.683
I've just done a perimeter
review of your preparations,

01:52.718 --> 01:55.219
and you've both done
a hell of a job

01:55.253 --> 01:56.520
keeping your troops motivated.

01:56.555 --> 01:58.389
2nd Mass looks like
it's locked and loaded.

01:58.423 --> 02:00.291
Well, the Skitters
know where we are.

02:00.325 --> 02:01.992
The smart move now is
to stay one step ahead.

02:02.027 --> 02:05.196
Weaver, where do we stand
right now?

02:05.231 --> 02:07.499
So, we scouted the roads
west of Gardner.

02:07.534 --> 02:10.235
As of last night,
they were all still clear.

02:11.404 --> 02:13.239
Dan, when's the last time
you slept?

02:15.575 --> 02:17.243
I'm fine.

02:17.277 --> 02:19.044
That wasn't the question.

02:19.079 --> 02:20.513
Well,
it's not like <i>anybody's</i>

02:20.547 --> 02:22.614
getting any rack time
around here.

02:24.117 --> 02:26.018
Tom's right.

02:26.052 --> 02:28.587
School's compromised.
We need to pull up stakes.

02:28.621 --> 02:29.755
Most times I'd agree,

02:29.789 --> 02:31.690
but the situation
on the ground

02:31.724 --> 02:33.358
has changed.

02:33.393 --> 02:34.993
Spotters tell me the Skitters
are all pulling back.

02:35.028 --> 02:36.561
They're converging
on that structure over Boston.

02:36.596 --> 02:37.963
Regrouping.

02:37.997 --> 02:39.532
Clearing
the field of battle?

02:39.566 --> 02:41.067
Could be the first step
in launching a new offensive.

02:41.101 --> 02:44.070
I've been in contact
with the resistance

02:44.105 --> 02:45.105
in L.A. and Chicago.

02:45.139 --> 02:46.673
It's the same story
all over,

02:46.708 --> 02:49.543
and we're not waiting
for them to make the next move.

02:49.578 --> 02:51.645
The timetable
for the coordinated attack

02:51.680 --> 02:53.347
on that structure
has been moved up.

02:53.382 --> 02:56.183
In four days,
we're taking this war to them.

02:56.218 --> 02:58.553
All right.

03:10.984 --> 03:12.951
Four days --
that's very short notice.

03:12.985 --> 03:14.553
Can't afford any delay.

03:14.587 --> 03:16.722
Every time these bastards
change tactics on us,

03:16.756 --> 03:18.590
we end up
getting hurt bad.

03:18.624 --> 03:21.026
Listen, Tom, I want you to take
a scout into the city tomorrow.

03:21.061 --> 03:23.062
Identify secure routes
for your vehicles,

03:23.097 --> 03:25.798
give me one last good
eyeball recon on that structure.

03:25.833 --> 03:26.967
Downtown's a long haul.

03:27.001 --> 03:28.802
We've got to have units
closer in.

03:28.837 --> 03:30.471
We <i>did</i> have units closer in.

03:30.505 --> 03:32.907
7th Mass started to pull back,
the aliens hit 'em hard.

03:32.942 --> 03:35.077
Terry Clayton may have been
a son of a bitch,

03:35.111 --> 03:37.012
but he wasn't lying
about the 7th.

03:37.046 --> 03:38.647
They're gone?

03:38.681 --> 03:40.949
Yep, and we've lost contact
with the 4th and the 5th.

03:40.984 --> 03:42.852
But the attack plan
remains the same --

03:42.886 --> 03:45.654
four units, one assigned
to each leg of the structure.

03:45.688 --> 03:47.856
We blow those demo charges
simultaneously,

03:47.890 --> 03:49.591
the structure collapses.

03:49.625 --> 03:51.893
Which brings me to the issue
of demo and high explosives.

03:51.927 --> 03:53.060
How we doing on that?

03:53.095 --> 03:54.795
The raw materials
aren't a problem,

03:54.829 --> 03:56.564
but we've stalled
on the build.

03:56.598 --> 03:58.632
Our people
don't have the most expertise

03:58.667 --> 04:00.501
in the making
of, uh, bombs --

04:00.535 --> 04:02.537
something that
I normally take comfort in.

04:02.571 --> 04:04.672
Well, we might have
caught a break.

04:06.375 --> 04:08.443
How's the patient?

04:08.477 --> 04:09.978
Recovering.

04:10.012 --> 04:12.647
And reminding me every day
why I specialized in pediatrics.

04:12.682 --> 04:16.117
Desperate times,
desperate measures.

04:16.152 --> 04:17.418
Who the hell is <i>this?</i>

04:17.452 --> 04:20.122
Name's Pope.

04:20.156 --> 04:21.423
You must be Porter.

04:21.458 --> 04:22.925
I'd stand and salute,
but, um...

04:22.959 --> 04:25.127
Isn't he the ex-con
that fired on your unit?

04:25.161 --> 04:26.828
That is <i>so</i> three weeks ago.

04:26.863 --> 04:30.099
Save the bull.
Tell him what you told me.

04:31.534 --> 04:34.035
I hear you're looking
to drive a truckload

04:34.070 --> 04:36.905
of high-test into
that Skitter palace downtown.

04:36.939 --> 04:39.641
That sounds like one
tricky piece of demolition work.

04:39.675 --> 04:41.643
And you know something
about demolition?

04:41.677 --> 04:43.911
A thing or two. You know,
around the water cooler.

04:43.946 --> 04:45.947
That makes you
some kind of expert?

04:45.981 --> 04:47.682
Around <i>my</i> water cooler?
Yes, it does.

04:47.716 --> 04:49.417
Listen, chief,
you do this thing wrong,

04:49.451 --> 04:52.454
odds are you're gonna blow up
your little scout troop

04:52.488 --> 04:55.223
long before you ever
roll into downtown Boston.

04:55.257 --> 04:56.925
You understand that?

04:56.959 --> 04:59.628
Somebody give me one reason
why we need to trust this guy.

04:59.662 --> 05:01.564
We shouldn't.

05:01.598 --> 05:03.932
Other than he came back
for Hal and Matt,

05:03.967 --> 05:05.734
he makes bread,

05:05.768 --> 05:07.736
and we don't have a lot
of options.

05:07.770 --> 05:10.039
All right, Pope.
Convince me.

05:10.073 --> 05:12.709
Everything I know was shown
by an ex-marine,

05:12.743 --> 05:14.144
used to live in Dorchester.

05:14.178 --> 05:16.312
What made you draw this?

05:18.449 --> 05:20.483
It's art therapy.

05:20.518 --> 05:21.751
Therapy?

05:21.785 --> 05:24.053
I asked Rick to sketch
what he was thinking.

05:24.088 --> 05:27.090
Sometimes it can help kids who've
been in a traumatic experience

05:27.124 --> 05:29.593
get their
feelings out.

05:29.627 --> 05:32.830
What made you draw this?

05:32.864 --> 05:35.532
I'm talking to you.

05:35.567 --> 05:36.834
Sorry.

05:36.868 --> 05:39.103
He knows a thing or two
about demolitions,

05:39.137 --> 05:40.838
but he's design only.

05:40.872 --> 05:42.640
I don't want him anywhere near
the raw materials.

05:42.674 --> 05:45.076
- Right.
- And he's under guard at all times.

05:45.110 --> 05:47.879
You two get those damn
demolition charges made.

05:47.913 --> 05:50.482
Okay.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.151
Take it.

05:58.625 --> 05:59.992
Take it.

06:58.984 --> 07:04.823
All right, all right.
All right!

07:04.858 --> 07:06.792
What's with the Victrola?

07:06.826 --> 07:08.060
It's a radio transmitter.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.529
Scouts found it
at a community college.

07:10.564 --> 07:12.798
These pre-transistor types
last forever.

07:12.833 --> 07:15.101
Great. Maybe you can get NPR
on that thing,

07:15.136 --> 07:17.838
and we can bore the aliens
to death.

07:17.872 --> 07:19.906
It's not supposed
to kill them.

07:19.941 --> 07:22.108
Well, I'm officially
<i>not</i> interested,

07:22.143 --> 07:23.810
but somebody's
got a death wish,

07:23.844 --> 07:25.712
'cause these bomb-making
formulas are a joke.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.046
Hey, hey, hey!

07:27.080 --> 07:29.114
Look at this crap.
These ratios are all wrong.

07:29.149 --> 07:30.849
Listen, you may have sold
the Colonel, you know,

07:30.883 --> 07:32.484
but I am not buying
this "Go, team!" act.

07:32.518 --> 07:34.052
Guys like you don't stick
their necks out for nothing.

07:34.086 --> 07:35.720
Well, that's where you're wrong,
Scotty boy.

07:35.754 --> 07:37.622
See, this is all about me.

07:37.656 --> 07:39.724
There's nothing on this Earth
I like more than wasting Skitters,

07:39.758 --> 07:41.826
except not blowing my head off
while doin' it.

07:41.861 --> 07:44.496
I never claimed to be
a demolition expert.

07:44.530 --> 07:46.064
Not much
on housekeeping, either.

07:46.099 --> 07:47.699
This is one hell of
a Mech collection you got here.

07:47.734 --> 07:50.536
Well, they've been cutting
a hell of a swath.

07:50.570 --> 07:52.538
Our bullets
just bounce off,

07:52.573 --> 07:53.973
and theirs, I don't know,

07:54.008 --> 07:56.409
they can just rip
right through an engine block.

07:56.444 --> 08:00.180
So I thought I would just
crack this one open and...

08:01.549 --> 08:02.549
Whoa!

08:02.583 --> 08:03.883
All right...

08:03.918 --> 08:05.618
Talk to Deadwood
over there.

08:05.653 --> 08:06.820
It's okay.

08:06.854 --> 08:07.754
Hey, Matt, Matt.

08:07.788 --> 08:10.590
It's okay.
I-I gotta go.

08:12.793 --> 08:15.095
We're off
to a hell of a start.

08:18.098 --> 08:20.833
Why don't you roll
"Radio free Europe" there

08:20.867 --> 08:22.168
into the hallway

08:22.202 --> 08:25.138
and let me play around
with the hard stuff, huh?

08:32.481 --> 08:34.398
Matt, what are you doing
out here?

08:34.399 --> 08:37.801
I was working with Uncle Scott
when that guy Pope showed up.

08:39.910 --> 08:41.110
Look...

08:41.144 --> 08:42.812
I know
that you want to help,

08:42.846 --> 08:44.881
but I want you to stay away
from Pope.

08:44.915 --> 08:47.050
He knows how to kill
the Skitters, Dad.

08:47.084 --> 08:48.418
I want to fight, too!

08:48.452 --> 08:50.620
I know you do,
but not with him and not today.

08:52.056 --> 08:54.057
I gotta go.

08:55.860 --> 08:58.496
I'll back as soon
as I can.

09:15.947 --> 09:18.048
I know that
"Weight of the world" look, Dad.

09:18.083 --> 09:19.383
What's up?

09:19.417 --> 09:21.118
What's <i>not?</i>

09:23.789 --> 09:25.089
Hey, the last couple days,

09:25.123 --> 09:27.058
have either one of you guys

09:27.092 --> 09:29.993
noticed anything different
about Weaver?

09:30.028 --> 09:31.828
Yeah, he's been different
since I met him.

09:31.863 --> 09:33.130
Why?

09:33.164 --> 09:34.164
Well, yesterday he kind of
laid into Rick

09:34.198 --> 09:35.832
for no reason at all.

09:35.867 --> 09:38.001
I don't think
he's slept in a couple days,

09:38.036 --> 09:39.737
and sometimes
when you're tired...

09:39.771 --> 09:41.973
You <i>what?</i>

09:42.008 --> 09:44.310
Go ahead.
I want to hear this.

09:44.344 --> 09:46.879
You don't always make
the best decisions.

09:46.913 --> 09:49.149
And I'm not the only one
who's noticed.

09:49.183 --> 09:51.318
But you're the one who's
questioning my ability to lead.

09:51.353 --> 09:54.655
- I never said that.
- Good. Dai, you're relieved!

09:54.690 --> 09:57.091
I'm taking your spot
on the scout.

10:01.163 --> 10:02.830
Sure that's a good idea?

10:02.865 --> 10:04.966
You want to stay here
and mind the fort, be my guest.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.468
The attack's
in three days.

10:06.502 --> 10:08.970
Something happens to me,
the 2nd Mass would go on.

10:09.005 --> 10:11.206
We can't exactly
afford to lose <i>you.</i>

10:12.542 --> 10:14.043
Mm.

10:14.077 --> 10:16.178
You know anything
about load-bearing dynamics,

10:16.212 --> 10:17.880
gauging
structural integrity?

10:17.914 --> 10:19.281
No.

10:19.315 --> 10:22.719
I had a construction business
after the service.

10:22.753 --> 10:26.990
Knowing <i>where</i> to hit this thing
is just as important as <i>how.</i>

10:38.103 --> 10:40.738
So he's a contractor.

10:40.772 --> 10:44.174
Must have been a lot of fun
on a remodel.

10:51.549 --> 10:53.950
Did you want to see me,
Dr. Glass?

10:53.984 --> 10:55.818
Oh. Ben, come in.

10:56.920 --> 10:58.321
It's gonna sound like
I'm joking,

10:58.355 --> 11:00.089
but take two
and see me in the morning.

11:00.124 --> 11:01.458
Okay. Thanks.

11:03.528 --> 11:05.162
Everything okay?

11:05.197 --> 11:06.764
Strictly a follow-up.

11:06.798 --> 11:09.868
It's part of
the comprehensive package.

11:09.902 --> 11:13.639
Have you been having any pain,
notice any changes?

11:13.673 --> 11:16.141
Uh, no.
I'm fine. I'm okay.

11:18.812 --> 11:20.078
Are they going away?

11:20.112 --> 11:21.212
I saw one of the other kids
from my group,

11:21.246 --> 11:22.780
and his have
almost disappeared.

11:22.815 --> 11:24.849
I know.

11:24.883 --> 11:26.384
So how come
I'm so different?

11:26.418 --> 11:28.152
Well, it's hard to say.

11:28.186 --> 11:30.354
You and Rick were harnessed
months longer than the others.

11:30.388 --> 11:34.958
Maybe it just takes
a little longer with you.

11:34.993 --> 11:38.028
Wait. Hold still a second.
I want to check something.

11:38.062 --> 11:40.597
Tell me if you feel this.

11:42.067 --> 11:43.968
Anything?

11:48.173 --> 11:48.940
Now?

11:48.974 --> 11:50.341
No.

11:51.944 --> 11:53.812
Is something wrong?

11:53.846 --> 11:56.248
It's okay.
Go ahead and get dressed.

12:00.853 --> 12:03.822
I thought he was
getting better, too.

12:03.856 --> 12:04.989
He is, physically.

12:05.024 --> 12:06.690
The truth is,
with his father gone,

12:06.725 --> 12:07.925
there really isn't a place
for him in the gym anymore.

12:07.959 --> 12:09.259
Because he was harnessed,
like me.

12:09.294 --> 12:12.229
You don't have to lie.
I know they're afraid of us.

12:12.263 --> 12:14.398
A few maybe,
but not everyone.

12:14.432 --> 12:17.167
What worries me most
is Rick's attitude.

12:17.201 --> 12:19.336
He never talks
about his father.

12:19.370 --> 12:22.106
It's like his death
barely registered.

12:22.140 --> 12:24.808
My dad said
soldiers get this thing --

12:24.843 --> 12:27.277
a thousand-yard stare.

12:27.311 --> 12:29.146
Maybe I could
to talk to him.

12:29.180 --> 12:31.815
I think
that would be great.

12:31.849 --> 12:36.653
What Rick needs more than
anything now is a friend.

12:44.229 --> 12:46.264
What do you think
it's for?

12:46.298 --> 12:48.033
It's hard to say.

12:48.067 --> 12:49.367
That flat space on top

12:49.402 --> 12:52.004
kind of reminds me
of an aircraft carrier.

12:52.038 --> 12:55.408
Whatever it is,
it's not impenetrable.

12:55.442 --> 12:58.510
They're using basic
construction techniques.

12:58.545 --> 13:00.178
Earth materials.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.013
Steel rebar, concrete...

13:02.048 --> 13:03.949
copper wire.

13:03.983 --> 13:05.317
It's like what the harnessed
kids were going after,

13:05.351 --> 13:06.718
that scrap metal.

13:06.752 --> 13:08.153
Bastards might be
from outer space,

13:08.187 --> 13:12.390
but their engineering is
strictly architecture 101.

13:12.424 --> 13:13.992
Get close enough,

13:14.026 --> 13:16.828
we can kill 'em.

13:16.862 --> 13:19.297
I like the sound of that.

13:21.401 --> 13:22.835
Hey, Dad.

13:22.869 --> 13:26.239
Look at that south base
right there.

13:26.273 --> 13:30.043
See where the Skitters
are working?

13:30.078 --> 13:31.178
Mm-hmm.

13:31.213 --> 13:33.381
I think I see
somebody with them.

13:33.415 --> 13:36.451
Something's
got their attention.

13:36.486 --> 13:37.819
To the right.

13:37.854 --> 13:39.021
What is that?

13:39.055 --> 13:41.322
Whoa.
What the...

13:41.357 --> 13:43.525
What the hell, man?

13:45.394 --> 13:47.161
Who do you think
they are?

13:47.196 --> 13:48.696
I don't know.

13:55.838 --> 13:58.506
That was close.
Let's get back to the bikes.

14:02.136 --> 14:04.938
I used to drive
this neighborhood every day.

14:04.972 --> 14:07.640
We had a place in Allston,
just off Royal,

14:07.675 --> 14:08.975
right across the river.

14:11.100 --> 14:12.300
First these Skitters and Mechs,

14:12.301 --> 14:14.012
and now these
humanoid things.

14:14.013 --> 14:15.593
Do you think
they're anything like us?

14:15.594 --> 14:16.694
No, not like us.

14:18.436 --> 14:19.937
Within any military
hierarchy,

14:19.971 --> 14:21.244
you've got troops
in the field,

14:21.245 --> 14:22.142
and then
you've got command.

14:22.143 --> 14:23.169
And up until this point,

14:23.170 --> 14:24.770
we've assumed that the Skitters
were command.

14:24.805 --> 14:26.271
Maybe we were wrong.

14:26.306 --> 14:28.140
Even if we were,
it doesn't change anything.

14:28.174 --> 14:29.708
Not tactically,
but what worries me

14:29.742 --> 14:31.609
is that this is the first time
we've seen them.

14:31.644 --> 14:33.177
Why is that a problem?

14:33.212 --> 14:34.712
Could mean
they were hanging back,

14:34.746 --> 14:37.315
waiting until it was safe
before showing themselves.

14:37.349 --> 14:38.650
They think
that they've already won.

14:38.684 --> 14:40.318
Hey, Dad.

14:40.352 --> 14:42.453
I see it.

14:42.488 --> 14:43.755
If they're following us,

14:43.789 --> 14:45.290
we're gonna take them right back
to the 2nd Mass.

14:45.324 --> 14:46.458
On me.

14:59.405 --> 15:00.638
Go on, get out of here,

15:00.673 --> 15:02.808
before I blow
your damn heads off!

15:02.842 --> 15:04.276
We're not gonna hurt you!

15:04.310 --> 15:05.711
Yeah, well,
that's what they <i>all</i> say.

15:05.745 --> 15:07.847
How do I know you're not
with <i>them?</i>

15:07.881 --> 15:10.483
Do we look like Skitters?!

15:10.517 --> 15:12.352
You know, it's not spacemen
that bother me.

15:12.386 --> 15:14.221
It's the human trash
that are tearing up this city,

15:14.255 --> 15:17.090
stealing everything
that's not nailed down!

15:17.124 --> 15:19.659
We're with the resistance!

15:19.694 --> 15:21.495
We could help you!

15:25.700 --> 15:27.734
Help, I don't need.

15:27.768 --> 15:31.471
You want to talk?
Let's talk.

15:40.680 --> 15:41.614
I'm Tom Mason.

15:41.648 --> 15:42.948
That's my son Hal

15:42.983 --> 15:45.017
and our commanding officer,
Captain Weaver.

15:45.051 --> 15:47.153
Sonja. Sonja Renken.

15:47.187 --> 15:49.322
This would go
a whole lot smoother

15:49.356 --> 15:51.023
if you'd lower your weapon.

15:53.260 --> 15:54.360
Well, I have to admit,

15:54.394 --> 15:55.728
you don't <i>seem</i>
like those others.

15:55.762 --> 16:00.333
Others? How long
you been out here?

16:00.367 --> 16:03.636
You can come in
if you'd like.

16:08.575 --> 16:10.375
We don't have time
for this.

16:10.410 --> 16:12.444
Well, if it's spacemen
you want,

16:12.478 --> 16:14.679
I've been keeping my eye
on them, too.

16:14.714 --> 16:16.848
Just around the corner.
2740.

16:16.882 --> 16:19.351
First floor, apartment 1B.

16:19.385 --> 16:20.785
Thank you.

16:20.820 --> 16:22.720
Doesn't seem right,
just leaving her here.

16:22.754 --> 16:24.502
Our mission
has to take priority,

16:24.503 --> 16:25.319
and this could be a trap.

16:25.326 --> 16:26.367
Or an opportunity.

16:26.368 --> 16:28.202
Porter sends us after
information on the structure.

16:28.236 --> 16:30.437
This woman's been living
next to it for months.

16:30.471 --> 16:32.960
Or she might just be some crazy woman,
living by herself.

16:33.532 --> 16:35.266
She survived the invasion,

16:35.300 --> 16:37.535
got the drop
on three fighters.

16:37.569 --> 16:39.437
We should <i>all</i> be so crazy.

16:39.471 --> 16:42.306
All right.

16:42.341 --> 16:46.111
You and Hal go in,
but watch yourselves.

16:46.145 --> 16:47.379
If the building's clear,

16:47.413 --> 16:48.814
find out
what she knows.

16:48.848 --> 16:49.948
What about you?

16:49.983 --> 16:51.283
I'll stand watch.

16:51.318 --> 16:54.654
I see any incoming,
I'll fire a warning shot.

17:13.911 --> 17:16.212
Unbelievable.

17:16.246 --> 17:20.349
Where's the sense of style,
stagecraft?

17:23.621 --> 17:25.055
What do you want?

17:25.089 --> 17:27.723
Mm, I-I left my backpack.

17:37.934 --> 17:41.002
How do you know so much
about bombs anyway?

17:41.036 --> 17:41.960
Did you go to school?

17:41.961 --> 17:43.695
Yeah. I did
the four-year program

17:43.729 --> 17:45.096
at Cochran Correctional.

17:45.130 --> 17:47.298
You know, your old man finds out
you're hanging with me,

17:47.332 --> 17:50.434
you're liable to discover
the true meaning

17:50.468 --> 17:51.968
of the word
"Corporal punishment,"

17:52.003 --> 17:53.182
after he shoots me.

17:53.183 --> 17:55.884
I know.
He told me to stay away.

18:02.473 --> 18:04.708
Don't worry, kid.

18:06.444 --> 18:10.781
Old Sparky here
is as dead as dead gets.

18:14.352 --> 18:16.320
It still scares me.

18:16.355 --> 18:18.222
Yeah? Why?

18:18.257 --> 18:20.091
Because they kill people.

18:20.125 --> 18:22.259
Kid, a lot of things
kill people.

18:22.294 --> 18:23.394
Not like this.

18:23.428 --> 18:28.232
I still have nightmares
about them --

18:28.266 --> 18:31.969
taking away Ben
or hurting mom.

18:33.271 --> 18:34.738
I want to be brave --

18:34.773 --> 18:37.507
like dad and Hal...
Like you.

18:38.509 --> 18:41.111
But I'm scared
all the time.

18:41.146 --> 18:44.314
It ain't
the Boogeyman, kid.

18:44.348 --> 18:47.684
It's just a pile of
rock-'em, sock-'em junk.

18:47.719 --> 18:49.453
Look.

18:49.487 --> 18:51.889
It's got gears,
bearings, servos --

18:51.923 --> 18:54.391
I wouldn't be surprised if there's a
"Made in Japan" sticker in there.

18:55.527 --> 18:57.828
This...

18:57.862 --> 19:00.397
This <i>is</i> interesting.

19:00.432 --> 19:02.099
What is it?

19:02.133 --> 19:03.934
It's a Mech bullet.

19:09.540 --> 19:11.140
It looks like ours.

19:11.174 --> 19:12.441
It is.
.44 caliber.

19:12.475 --> 19:14.476
I'm betting
these scaly maggots,

19:14.510 --> 19:18.113
they go around, they raid all
the military ammo dumps worldwide

19:18.147 --> 19:19.347
for the shells,

19:19.382 --> 19:21.983
then they convert 'em
for their robocops.

19:22.018 --> 19:23.785
Turns out
our alien friends

19:23.820 --> 19:26.388
are big on recycling.

19:26.423 --> 19:28.991
The slug -- now,
that's the interesting part.

19:29.025 --> 19:30.593
It's made out
of Mech-metal.

19:30.627 --> 19:33.964
It's kind of like the depleted
uranium the army uses

19:33.998 --> 19:37.467
for tank busters,
only <i>way</i> nastier.

19:37.502 --> 19:41.672
I wish we could use these
against them.

19:43.809 --> 19:47.135
Out of the mouths
of babes.

19:53.455 --> 19:54.072
We got lucky.

19:54.073 --> 19:55.306
They found some Fruit Loops
still in the plastic.

19:55.341 --> 19:58.409
I love that sugar rush.

19:59.645 --> 20:02.446
It bothers you,
doesn't it?

20:02.481 --> 20:04.115
The way
they're looking at us.

20:04.149 --> 20:06.617
I try not to
think about it.

20:06.652 --> 20:11.222
They don't
understand yet...

20:11.256 --> 20:14.325
But they will.

20:16.761 --> 20:18.495
Um...

20:18.530 --> 20:21.064
I know you must be hurting
after what happened to your dad,

20:21.099 --> 20:22.733
and if you ever want
to talk about it or...

20:22.767 --> 20:25.169
It doesn't matter now.

20:25.203 --> 20:29.074
He was a part of the way
I was before.

20:29.108 --> 20:31.476
Before?
Like with the Skitters?

20:31.511 --> 20:34.247
Because that's over.
You know that.

20:34.281 --> 20:36.516
The doctors may have
removed the harness,

20:36.551 --> 20:39.320
but that doesn't mean
that they've abandoned us.

20:39.354 --> 20:41.756
We're the lucky ones.

20:41.790 --> 20:43.424
No. No.

20:43.459 --> 20:44.692
I <i>hate</i> the Skitters!

20:44.726 --> 20:46.727
I <i>hate</i> what they did
to me!

20:46.762 --> 20:50.164
If I had the chance,
I'd kill every last one of them!

20:50.198 --> 20:52.500
It'll get clearer,
I promise.

20:52.534 --> 20:54.502
They love us, Ben,

20:54.536 --> 20:56.771
and they <i>will</i>
come back for us.

21:00.643 --> 21:04.546
I am sorry
that I don't have any milk.

21:04.580 --> 21:06.147
That's okay.

21:06.182 --> 21:09.351
It's actually a lot better
than we're used to.

21:13.323 --> 21:15.124
Thank you.

21:15.159 --> 21:18.061
So you found all
these supplies yourself?

21:18.095 --> 21:19.062
Uh, yes.

21:19.097 --> 21:21.932
Over time. Why?

21:23.668 --> 21:25.302
Mmm.

21:25.336 --> 21:27.204
Oh, it's just that a lot of
the food stores that we passed

21:27.238 --> 21:28.672
on the way in
looked a little picked over.

21:28.706 --> 21:31.241
Well, some.
Uh, not all.

21:32.410 --> 21:35.211
We used to have
so much fun here.

21:35.245 --> 21:37.045
Joel and Amy,
my children,

21:37.080 --> 21:40.215
used to play
in that courtyard.

21:40.249 --> 21:43.018
The Gibsons on the fourth floor
were expert bridge players.

21:43.052 --> 21:44.419
John Hernandez,
on eight,

21:44.453 --> 21:47.089
loved his football.

21:47.123 --> 21:49.692
Uh, they took me away,
you know,

21:49.726 --> 21:51.160
uh, just for a bit.

21:51.194 --> 21:53.196
The aliens.

21:53.230 --> 21:55.599
Uh, to a camp very far
from here.

21:55.633 --> 21:58.435
There were so many
of us there at first,

21:58.470 --> 21:59.737
and then only a few.

21:59.771 --> 22:01.305
How did <i>you</i> get away?

22:01.339 --> 22:03.107
Oh, I didn't.
They let me go.

22:03.141 --> 22:05.643
They don't care
about someone like me.

22:05.677 --> 22:08.145
But you talked to them?

22:08.179 --> 22:09.713
Just a little.

22:09.747 --> 22:11.348
Uh, through the children,

22:11.382 --> 22:14.184
the ones with the monsters
on their necks.

22:14.219 --> 22:15.352
The harnessed kids.

22:15.386 --> 22:17.487
Did they say
why they were here,

22:17.522 --> 22:19.089
what they wanted
from us?

22:19.123 --> 22:21.358
No. They wouldn't talk to us
about that.

22:21.392 --> 22:23.660
But after what happened
to us in the camp,

22:23.694 --> 22:26.129
I know that
they don't want us here --

22:26.163 --> 22:27.630
not any of us.

22:30.734 --> 22:32.969
Is that Weaver?

22:34.339 --> 22:35.806
You see any ships?

22:35.840 --> 22:37.408
No. Nothing
on the ground!

22:37.442 --> 22:39.777
Hey! Weaver!

22:41.447 --> 22:43.048
He pulled
the sparkplugs.

22:43.082 --> 22:44.916
Where's he going?

22:47.186 --> 22:49.287
There's no way
we can catch him,

22:49.321 --> 22:50.355
and he knows it.

22:50.389 --> 22:51.756
I knew something was wrong.

22:51.791 --> 22:54.058
I could have stopped him
back at the school.

22:54.092 --> 22:56.260
Well, captain gives an order,
you're supposed to follow it.

22:56.294 --> 22:57.761
Think I learned that
from <i>you.</i>

22:57.796 --> 22:59.496
Where do you think
he's going?

22:59.531 --> 23:01.131
I don't know. He did say
that he had family in Allston.

23:01.166 --> 23:02.566
I thought he lost them
back in the attack.

23:02.601 --> 23:04.168
Well, he's never really
gone into it,

23:04.202 --> 23:06.436
but not knowing can be
a powerful incentive.

23:06.471 --> 23:07.638
What did he say --

23:07.672 --> 23:09.507
across the river,
on Royal Street --

23:09.541 --> 23:12.343
is that where he said he lived
before the attack?

23:12.377 --> 23:13.545
A-are you leaving?

23:13.579 --> 23:15.446
Just to go look
for our friend, yeah.

23:15.480 --> 23:17.181
You'll be coming back,
though, won't you?

23:17.216 --> 23:19.183
Just as soon as we can.

23:22.554 --> 23:24.122
This is all
very mysterious.

23:24.156 --> 23:25.123
Where are we going?

23:25.157 --> 23:26.391
Just over here.

23:26.425 --> 23:28.093
There's something I need you
to help me with,

23:28.127 --> 23:30.128
but it's really important
that you keep it between us.

23:30.162 --> 23:31.996
Yeah. I've always been good
at keeping secrets.

23:32.031 --> 23:34.466
I hope so,
because this one's a big one.

23:38.172 --> 23:40.740
What do you think
you're gonna find?

23:40.774 --> 23:42.509
Nothing, I hope.

23:53.787 --> 23:56.555
Are you hanging in there?

23:56.589 --> 23:58.190
Y-yeah.

23:58.224 --> 24:01.059
My class was still
in basic anatomy

24:01.093 --> 24:04.362
when they attacked, so...

24:04.396 --> 24:07.032
Cadaver research
was second year.

24:07.066 --> 24:09.134
Consider this
extra credit.

24:09.168 --> 24:11.437
Now what? We...

24:11.471 --> 24:12.671
We look inside.

24:17.411 --> 24:20.647
Muscles, bones...

24:20.682 --> 24:22.749
Circulatory system.

24:22.784 --> 24:25.185
They're not all that different
from us.

24:25.220 --> 24:26.186
Different enough.

24:26.220 --> 24:29.623
Hand me a scalpel.

24:29.657 --> 24:31.391
Okay.

24:56.581 --> 24:58.315
Oh, no.

24:58.350 --> 24:59.717
This is what
I was afraid of.

25:04.256 --> 25:05.690
The Skitters
were harnessed?

25:05.725 --> 25:07.125
What does that mean?

25:07.159 --> 25:08.593
That maybe they weren't
always Skitters.

25:08.627 --> 25:11.363
It's hard to imagine,
but this thing...

25:11.397 --> 25:14.733
Might have been
something else.

25:30.125 --> 25:31.692
This is Royal Street.

25:31.726 --> 25:33.327
And there's his bike
out front.

25:33.361 --> 25:35.095
He must have figured
we wouldn't find him.

25:35.129 --> 25:38.098
Or he didn't care.
I'll go in and check this out.

25:38.132 --> 25:41.033
- You stay here and guard the bikes.
- No way. You don't know what's inside.

25:41.068 --> 25:41.905
I'm gonna back you up.

25:41.930 --> 25:43.717
That's what you're doing.
If this goes south,

25:43.870 --> 25:44.986
you got to get back
to the 2nd Mass.

25:45.011 --> 25:46.171
No. I'm not
gonna leave you here.

25:46.172 --> 25:48.507
Listen, Weaver and I don't agree
on much, but we agree on this.

25:48.541 --> 25:49.908
The mission's
got to come first.

25:49.942 --> 25:51.276
You got to get back
to Porter,

25:51.310 --> 25:52.077
give him the recon photos
and the route.

25:52.111 --> 25:53.278
All right.

25:53.312 --> 25:54.612
Tell him what we saw
at the structure.

26:46.436 --> 26:48.236
Captain?

26:55.145 --> 26:57.814
I built this myself --

26:57.848 --> 26:59.949
every brick.

27:02.820 --> 27:05.221
I can't tell you how many nights
we spent out here,

27:05.256 --> 27:06.422
under the stars.

27:06.457 --> 27:07.891
Talk to me.
What are we doing here?

27:07.925 --> 27:09.459
You're looking
for your family?

27:11.028 --> 27:14.964
I lost them a long time
before the aliens came.

27:14.999 --> 27:17.067
We'd --

27:17.101 --> 27:18.902
how do you say it now? --

27:18.936 --> 27:21.037
grown apart.

27:21.072 --> 27:23.273
Linda and I split...

27:23.307 --> 27:27.476
A year
before the attack.

27:27.511 --> 27:29.079
Okay.

27:29.113 --> 27:30.947
If we're not here
for them...

27:37.854 --> 27:39.221
What is this?

27:39.255 --> 27:43.525
Mike's son, Rick, drew this.
What is this?

27:45.494 --> 27:48.996
That's my <i>house,</i> Tom.
Look at that.

27:49.031 --> 27:52.066
It's been eating at me
ever since I saw it.

27:52.100 --> 27:54.168
That's not
a coincidence.

27:54.202 --> 27:56.336
What if these damn things
are planting --

27:56.370 --> 28:00.807
planting this
inside their heads...

28:00.842 --> 28:01.975
To get at me?

28:02.010 --> 28:04.078
You know what I'm saying?

28:09.050 --> 28:12.519
Yeah, you're right.
This does look like your house.

28:13.821 --> 28:18.625
Looks like...most of the houses
on this block.

28:20.428 --> 28:23.296
I don't think
they can read our minds.

28:23.330 --> 28:26.265
But you don't know that.

28:26.299 --> 28:29.367
I saw the blood inside.

28:29.402 --> 28:31.636
Want to tell me
about that?

28:41.213 --> 28:43.882
I came here right after
the bombs dropped,

28:43.916 --> 28:46.084
and I found
Linda's fiancé outside.

28:46.118 --> 28:47.418
He was badly wounded.

28:47.453 --> 28:50.021
He had been trying to help them
when he got hit.

28:50.056 --> 28:51.957
My youngest daughter,
Sophia,

28:51.991 --> 28:54.426
captured by the Skitters.

28:56.830 --> 28:59.165
Linda and Jeanne were...

28:59.200 --> 29:01.368
taking cover in a house
down the street,

29:01.402 --> 29:04.271
and the Mechs opened up
on them.

29:04.306 --> 29:05.907
And, um...

29:14.883 --> 29:18.452
I combed that rubble
for a long time,

29:18.487 --> 29:21.255
but they were gone.

29:21.289 --> 29:24.192
So I went
after Sophia.

29:29.298 --> 29:31.966
You found her?

29:32.935 --> 29:34.970
I found her.

29:37.006 --> 29:39.508
She was harnessed.

29:41.178 --> 29:45.281
And they had her working
at a site near Sudbury.

29:45.315 --> 29:48.984
Pulled her out of there
and took her home.

29:53.223 --> 29:56.391
The harness --
you tried to take it off of her?

29:58.060 --> 29:59.594
Yeah.

30:03.433 --> 30:06.235
But those spikes...

30:06.269 --> 30:09.104
They were in too deep.

30:13.276 --> 30:17.112
And I couldn't, so...

30:20.182 --> 30:22.016
You should have told me.

30:22.050 --> 30:24.218
Ah!

30:24.252 --> 30:26.186
I've never been one
for self-pity.

30:26.221 --> 30:27.521
A lot of people

30:27.555 --> 30:29.456
had a lot worse things
than that happen to them.

30:29.490 --> 30:31.324
Not like that.

30:32.493 --> 30:33.593
I can't believe

30:33.627 --> 30:34.994
that when I brought Ben

30:35.029 --> 30:37.097
and those other kids back,
you didn't --

30:37.131 --> 30:38.331
well, I was happy for you.

30:38.365 --> 30:40.233
I was happy for you,
and I was happy for Mike.

30:40.267 --> 30:41.534
Maybe if I'd waited, huh?

30:45.473 --> 30:49.242
We can't stay here.

30:49.276 --> 30:50.943
We got to get back.

30:50.978 --> 30:53.012
I know. You've got your boys
to fight for.

30:53.047 --> 30:55.014
That's something
worth fighting for.

30:55.049 --> 30:57.450
But all I've been living on
this whole time --

30:57.485 --> 30:59.085
I'm just living
on revenge!

30:59.120 --> 31:00.721
It's not good enough!

31:00.755 --> 31:02.089
It's <i>not</i> good enough!

31:02.123 --> 31:04.125
And you're right.
I have <i>not</i> been sleeping,

31:04.159 --> 31:05.960
but I'm <i>gonna</i>
sleep tonight.

31:05.995 --> 31:07.829
I'm gonna sleep
in my own bed,

31:07.863 --> 31:09.865
which is where
I should have been...

31:09.899 --> 31:13.035
All along.

31:13.070 --> 31:15.304
You're gonna quit?

31:16.439 --> 31:19.075
You're giving up?

31:19.109 --> 31:21.043
We're three days away
from the attack.

31:24.481 --> 31:26.849
Hey, look, I'm sorry
about what happened,

31:26.883 --> 31:30.586
but there are a <i>lot</i>
of other lives at stake.

31:34.358 --> 31:35.491
That's a Mech.

31:42.933 --> 31:44.300
Hal's out front.
We got to go!

31:44.334 --> 31:46.168
You go.

31:46.203 --> 31:47.470
You save yourself
and your son.

31:47.504 --> 31:49.472
This is where I belong.

31:52.176 --> 31:54.210
I'm not leaving
without you.

32:06.723 --> 32:09.125
I'll draw it in.

32:09.159 --> 32:10.393
Give you and Hal
time to retreat.

32:10.427 --> 32:11.160
No.

32:11.195 --> 32:12.261
That's an order!

32:12.296 --> 32:13.830
And I respectfully
decline!

32:13.864 --> 32:16.433
Two grenades at close range
might be enough.

32:22.908 --> 32:23.908
What the...

32:23.943 --> 32:28.147
Captain! Weaver!

32:28.181 --> 32:29.548
Are you with me?!

32:31.886 --> 32:34.221
Let's get
this damn thing.

32:34.255 --> 32:35.856
Are you ready
with those grenades?

32:35.890 --> 32:37.857
I'm good.
Tell me when to go.

32:37.891 --> 32:39.559
When I open up,
you got three seconds!

32:47.902 --> 32:50.270
Okay, go, go, go, go!

33:04.083 --> 33:06.350
Dad! You all right?
Where's Weaver?

33:06.385 --> 33:07.952
He's still inside.

33:07.986 --> 33:09.220
That was no
passing patrol.

33:09.254 --> 33:11.089
That Mech came straight
to Weaver's house.

33:11.123 --> 33:12.857
The only person who knew we were
here was that woman Sonja.

33:12.891 --> 33:14.225
That woman gave us up.

33:15.828 --> 33:16.961
You ready to go?

33:16.995 --> 33:18.463
Damn right.

33:24.470 --> 33:25.770
Oh. Uh, it's you.

33:25.804 --> 33:26.971
We brought more food.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.539
Do you have anything
to tell us?

33:28.574 --> 33:29.841
Just as I told you.

33:29.875 --> 33:31.443
You're alone,
and everything's fine.

33:31.477 --> 33:33.311
Uh, no.
I haven't seen anyone

33:33.345 --> 33:35.746
since those people earlier today.
Dad!

33:38.183 --> 33:41.185
We couldn't get them.
Do you know where they've gone?

33:41.219 --> 33:43.387
No.

33:44.756 --> 33:46.357
It's Karen, dad!
Shh!

33:46.391 --> 33:48.059
They got her!

33:48.093 --> 33:49.661
We can't help her
right now.

33:55.902 --> 33:57.235
We don't know how many more
of them are out there.

33:57.270 --> 33:58.704
We can't leave her here.
We can't leave her.

33:58.738 --> 34:00.339
She's been coming here
the last few days.

34:00.373 --> 34:01.473
She has
a <i>very</i> pretty face.

34:01.507 --> 34:02.674
Do you know her?

34:02.708 --> 34:04.276
That's my son's
girlfriend.

34:04.310 --> 34:06.644
The aliens took her
three weeks ago.

34:31.130 --> 34:33.165
You told them about us,
didn't you?

34:33.199 --> 34:35.068
You gave us up
to those things.

34:35.101 --> 34:38.071
But they promised me
they wouldn't hurt you.

34:38.106 --> 34:40.040
And you believed them,
after what they did to you?

34:40.074 --> 34:42.409
The girl said
that they would bring you back,

34:42.444 --> 34:43.745
and then I would have
company again --

34:43.779 --> 34:47.581
the way
it used to be before.

34:47.616 --> 34:51.650
They always <i>promise</i>
to bring them back.

34:51.686 --> 34:53.620
Who knows how many people
she's given up to them?

34:53.654 --> 34:55.522
It's why they let her go.

34:55.556 --> 34:57.290
It's an old tactic.

34:57.325 --> 34:59.726
You leave a couple friendlies
behind like watchdogs,

34:59.760 --> 35:01.729
and they pick up the intel
that the enemy never could.

35:01.763 --> 35:04.231
They got her
for a box of tea.

35:04.265 --> 35:05.232
What are we
gonna do now?

35:05.267 --> 35:06.601
We're gonna take her
with us,

35:06.635 --> 35:07.735
make sure she doesn't do this
to anybody else.

35:07.769 --> 35:09.637
Mm, no.

35:09.671 --> 35:11.005
In three days,
all this changes.

35:11.039 --> 35:12.640
This place
is all she's got.

35:12.674 --> 35:14.108
We take it away from her,

35:14.142 --> 35:16.544
we might as well
shoot her on the spot.

35:23.518 --> 35:25.119
It's gonna be
getting light soon.

35:25.153 --> 35:27.288
We've got to go. You're welcome
to come along with us.

35:27.322 --> 35:28.756
Oh, I don't think so.

35:28.791 --> 35:31.559
I should be here when Amy
and Joel come back home.

35:31.593 --> 35:34.796
Well, if you decide
to change your mind,

35:34.830 --> 35:36.197
we're gonna be
heading north.

35:36.232 --> 35:38.166
We've heard
that Gloucester is clear.

35:38.201 --> 35:40.101
Gloucester?

35:40.136 --> 35:42.404
Well, I've heard
that that's quite lovely.

35:42.438 --> 35:44.907
I've heard that, too.

35:48.679 --> 35:49.812
Gloucester?

35:49.847 --> 35:51.348
We won't be there,

35:51.382 --> 35:52.716
but that's where the aliens
will be looking

35:52.750 --> 35:54.318
after the next
box of tea.

36:07.534 --> 36:10.470
Anne?

36:10.504 --> 36:12.638
I've been thinking
about it for hours,

36:12.673 --> 36:15.274
and I don't see how we can
keep this to ourselves.

36:15.309 --> 36:17.143
You don't?

36:17.177 --> 36:18.744
No, the others
seem to have healed,

36:18.779 --> 36:19.979
but Ben and Rick --

36:20.013 --> 36:21.247
we took
the harnesses off.

36:21.281 --> 36:23.015
That should have stopped
the process.

36:23.050 --> 36:24.650
We don't know that.

36:26.319 --> 36:28.453
People here
are already terrified

36:28.487 --> 36:29.988
of these kids.

36:30.022 --> 36:32.323
If this gets out,
God only knows what they'll do.

36:32.358 --> 36:33.991
What about Tom?

36:38.129 --> 36:39.830
I have to tell him.

36:39.864 --> 36:44.301
After everything they went
through to get him back,

36:44.336 --> 36:48.239
he could still
lose Ben.

36:54.980 --> 36:57.315
First chance I get,
I'm going after her, Dad.

36:57.349 --> 36:59.384
First chance.

37:01.754 --> 37:03.255
We need to talk --

37:03.289 --> 37:05.123
about what
we're gonna tell Porter.

37:05.157 --> 37:07.159
I'm not asking
for any favors.

37:07.193 --> 37:09.194
I'm not offering any.

37:10.663 --> 37:12.897
If the 2nd Mass loses faith
in their commander...

37:16.102 --> 37:20.238
Okay, I'll have Dai take the
recon photos to Colonel Porter.

37:20.273 --> 37:24.075
I say we tell him
about the structure,

37:24.110 --> 37:27.245
the creatures, Karen,
and the Renken woman.

37:27.279 --> 37:29.547
The rest can stay
between you and me.

37:29.581 --> 37:32.617
All right.

37:34.520 --> 37:36.454
You still haven't told me
what changed your mind

37:36.488 --> 37:38.356
about coming back.

37:53.203 --> 37:54.470
These were Linda's.

37:54.505 --> 37:58.241
They were the only pair
that she had.

37:58.275 --> 38:00.576
I was in the house
a week after the attack,

38:00.611 --> 38:01.944
and they were not there.

38:03.514 --> 38:08.118
It tells me
she might have come back,

38:08.153 --> 38:14.091
that there's a chance
that my wife is still alive...

38:14.125 --> 38:17.427
And maybe
my oldest girl.

38:19.463 --> 38:21.697
All right,
everybody gather 'round!

38:21.732 --> 38:23.099
I got a demonstration!

38:23.133 --> 38:24.233
What the hell is this?

38:24.268 --> 38:25.602
Come on, everybody!
Let's go!

38:25.636 --> 38:27.704
Come on, come on!
I'm only gonna do this once!

38:27.738 --> 38:29.572
So!

38:29.607 --> 38:31.774
The score is aliens, one...

38:31.809 --> 38:34.043
Humans, zero!

38:34.078 --> 38:37.013
Hell, humans aren't even
on the board!

38:37.047 --> 38:39.181
I leave for one day,
look what happens.

38:39.216 --> 38:41.350
I'm just glad you're back.
How did it go?

38:41.385 --> 38:44.553
It went.
I'll tell you about it later.

38:44.588 --> 38:46.021
Good. We need to talk.

38:46.056 --> 38:47.422
What's all this?

38:47.457 --> 38:49.458
Pope just said he wants
to show us something.

38:49.492 --> 38:52.394
Look at me
when I'm talking to you!

38:52.428 --> 38:54.629
So, the whole
gang's here! Good.

38:54.664 --> 38:57.532
I do <i>not</i> want to have
to do this twice.

38:57.566 --> 39:00.267
You're supposed to be
making bombs, Pope!

39:00.302 --> 39:01.635
You ever heard
of multitasking?

39:01.669 --> 39:03.170
It's all under control.

39:03.205 --> 39:05.072
It better be,
'cause I'm itching

39:05.106 --> 39:06.740
for a reason to put you back
behind bars.

39:06.775 --> 39:08.109
Dad!

39:08.143 --> 39:10.245
Hey.

39:10.279 --> 39:11.446
What are you doing here?

39:11.481 --> 39:12.748
You should be
in school.

39:12.782 --> 39:15.251
I was working with Pope.
Dad, it is so cool!

39:15.285 --> 39:17.052
I thought I told you
to stay away from him.

39:17.087 --> 39:18.587
But he knows
how to kill the Mechs!

39:18.622 --> 39:20.456
Why are we losing the war?
Why is that?

39:20.491 --> 39:23.125
Come on. Just watch.

39:23.160 --> 39:25.227
Because the bad guys
have us outgunned!

39:25.262 --> 39:29.231
You know, it takes an entire
magazine just to put a dent

39:29.265 --> 39:31.233
in one of
their tin soldiers!

39:31.267 --> 39:32.400
May I?

39:34.103 --> 39:35.970
Watch him!

39:54.521 --> 39:57.123
So that's the way it's been!

39:57.158 --> 40:02.495
But there's a new sheriff
in town!

40:03.830 --> 40:06.532
It's a standard bullet,

40:06.566 --> 40:08.967
only it's got
a Mech-metal slug.

40:10.303 --> 40:12.570
That a .45?
Captain?

40:12.604 --> 40:14.505
Go ahead.

40:51.879 --> 40:53.713
Are you saying you can make
more of these?

40:53.747 --> 40:55.414
With the right
bullet-making tools,

40:55.449 --> 40:58.317
I can melt this stuff down,
spit 'em out like gumballs.

40:58.351 --> 41:00.453
I'll also give you something
for that .50-cal.

41:00.487 --> 41:03.389
You do that.

41:08.262 --> 41:10.564
We're taking this fight
to them!
