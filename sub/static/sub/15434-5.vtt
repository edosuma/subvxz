WEBVTT

00:00.200 --> 00:01.300
My husband had an affair

00:01.300 --> 00:03.400
with that woman, Holly, over there.

00:04.000 --> 00:05.600
You are so hot.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.200
Warren, just please, just--

00:07.200 --> 00:08.000
Shut up?
- Yeah.

00:08.800 --> 00:11.300
Jonathan, I'm missing you badly.

00:11.301 --> 00:13.300
Am I allowed to say that even 
though I cheated on you?

00:13.300 --> 00:15.300
And I made the biggest mistake of my life?

00:15.700 --> 00:17.000
(Scotty) This is the lawyer I mentioned.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.500
Kevin Walker, Randy Stewart.

00:18.500 --> 00:20.500
Hi.
- Hi, I've heard a lot about you.

00:20.600 --> 00:23.700
Have you given any more thought to getting a criminal lawyer?

00:23.700 --> 00:25.200
You're talking about the pension fund, huh?

00:25.500 --> 00:27.400
That lovely situation your father left us with.

00:27.400 --> 00:30.500
Do you have feelings for Holly?
- Beginning of a friendship. Yeah, maybe.

00:30.900 --> 00:32.299
Diabetes is a disease

00:32.299 --> 00:33.900
she can live with and live fully.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.600
Dad never stopped caring about what you did with your life.

00:36.900 --> 00:37.900
I stop right now.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.900
(Kitty) They're called Santa Anas.

00:40.900 --> 00:42.200
It's a Southern California thing.

00:42.200 --> 00:44.300
It's these weird, hot winds

00:44.300 --> 00:46.300
that blow out of the desert and into L.A.

00:47.300 --> 00:49.900
When I was a kid, they used to completely freak me out.

00:49.900 --> 00:52.700
I used to get so scared that I couldn't sleep alone,

00:52.700 --> 00:55.100
and so I would jump into my mom and dad's bed,

00:55.100 --> 00:57.300
and I'd hide under the covers.

00:58.800 --> 01:00.300
(Jonathan) I wish you could jump into my bed.

01:00.700 --> 01:01.600
I've got an idea.

01:02.200 --> 01:03.100
Pretend I'm not in New York.

01:04.300 --> 01:05.700
Pretend you're sleeping with me

01:06.600 --> 01:08.100
and the warm wind that's blowing--

01:08.200 --> 01:09.000
it's my breath.

01:09.500 --> 01:10.500
Oh, Jonathan.

01:10.500 --> 01:12.000
Come on, it'll be good for you.
- OK.

01:12.900 --> 01:14.500
So you're lying in bed with me,

01:15.200 --> 01:18.200
and the Santa Anas are your breath.

01:18.500 --> 01:19.700
And I'm kissing your neck.

01:21.600 --> 01:23.900
And now I'm moving lower. So hot.

01:24.300 --> 01:27.500
Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah, baby, hot, hot.

01:27.800 --> 01:29.200
You're wearing those pink pajamas

01:29.200 --> 01:30.800
with the little blue flowers, aren't you?

01:31.900 --> 01:33.100
How did you know that?

01:33.600 --> 01:35.100
It's a good guess. Take 'em off.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.100
Are they off yet?

01:38.800 --> 01:39.600
They're off.

01:40.600 --> 01:41.600
Now take off your panties.

01:42.200 --> 01:43.800
Mmm. Mmm.

01:44.100 --> 01:46.000
See? You're getting into this, aren't you?

01:46.600 --> 01:49.400
Are you naked?
- Oh, yeah, completely.

01:49.700 --> 01:50.700
You're lying.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
No, I'm not.

01:52.200 --> 01:54.200
Now it's your turn, Bucko. Take it all off.

01:54.500 --> 01:55.900
I know for a fact you're lying.
- AAH!

01:55.900 --> 01:57.400
AAH! Oh.

02:00.200 --> 02:01.400
Are you-- are you OK? I'm so sorry.

02:01.400 --> 02:04.700
It was supposed to be a surprise.
- Are you crazy?

02:06.800 --> 02:10.000
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
You know what? You are lucky.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.100
You are so lucky that I am the only Republican

02:13.100 --> 02:14.900
who doesn't own a gun. 
- Oh, my God.

02:14.900 --> 02:17.400
Kitty! Kitty! Kitty! Kitty!
Oh, no, Mother.

02:17.400 --> 02:20.300
Mother, it's-- it's-- 
- Jonathan.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.500
Jonathan? Close your eyes.

02:23.500 --> 02:26.600
I'm sorry, Nora, I just -- I knew where the key was,

02:26.600 --> 02:28.600
and I just wanted to surprise your daughter.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.100
I'm getting a rottweiler.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.400
I should clean this up.

02:31.400 --> 02:35.000
Oh, no, just, uh, come kiss me first.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.100
Oh, God.

02:40.700 --> 02:42.700
David, you didn't have to come yourself.

02:42.700 --> 02:44.000
You could've just sent one of your guys.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.500
It's OK. Next time something jumps out of someone's hands

02:46.500 --> 02:48.100
and hits the shelf, this won't happen.

02:48.200 --> 02:50.300
Nothing's jumping out of anybody's hands, David.

02:50.300 --> 02:51.300
It was an accident.

02:51.300 --> 02:54.000
Oh, Honey, you can't help it if you're still scared of the wind.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.800
I am not scared of the wind!
- Whoo! Whoo!

02:57.800 --> 03:00.900
OK, OK, OK, Mother. Enough.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.100
I should go. I took a suite at the Ritz.

03:04.100 --> 03:05.200
Nora, I'll just get my bags.

03:05.800 --> 03:07.200
I'll see you later.
- OK.

03:07.600 --> 03:10.900
I'll bring my stuff over after work, maybe around seven-ish?
- OK.

03:11.600 --> 03:13.000
Jonathan, you should stay here.

03:13.700 --> 03:15.000
Oh, no, it could be for a while.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.200
At least till Kitty convinces me to move out here for good.

03:18.500 --> 03:21.500
Mom, he's gonna be here indefinitely.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.000
We are trying to figure out what we are and--

03:23.000 --> 03:25.100
He should stay here.
- Mom, you don't even like him.

03:25.100 --> 03:27.000
You have described him on several occasions

03:27.000 --> 03:29.600
as being a rabid, free-market capitalist sociopath,

03:30.100 --> 03:32.300
and a few other choice words that I won't mention

03:32.300 --> 03:34.000
in front of David.
- No, go ahead.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.500
I think I've heard all of Nora's expletives over the years.

03:36.700 --> 03:37.600
Jonathan!

03:37.900 --> 03:39.900
Oh, no, no, Mom.

03:39.900 --> 03:41.600
They don't get to choose the buyer, I do.

03:42.400 --> 03:44.200
They've got four minutes to accept the offer or we walk.

03:45.200 --> 03:46.200
Jonthan, excuse me.

03:46.500 --> 03:49.200
You -- you know, I would absolutely love it

03:49.200 --> 03:50.500
if you would stay here with us.

03:52.600 --> 03:53.400
Sure.

03:54.100 --> 03:54.900
What's your fax number?

03:56.600 --> 03:58.400
Uh...
(Sarah) She said what?

03:59.300 --> 04:01.600
Oh, I hope you had the good sense to turn her down.

04:02.000 --> 04:02.800
I hope he did.

04:03.800 --> 04:05.100
Oh, Jonathan's no pushover. He can handle her.

04:05.100 --> 04:06.400
How's Paige?

04:06.900 --> 04:09.500
She's fine. I'm a wreck. I can't talk about it.

04:09.500 --> 04:12.100
I-I don't wanna cry anymore because you'll start crying,

04:12.100 --> 04:14.400
and then I won't be able to stop crying.
- I wanna cry.

04:14.400 --> 04:18.200
Ah, Kevin just walked in. I'll put you on speakerphone.
- No, no, no, no, don't--

04:18.200 --> 04:19.600
Don't put me on speaker, please, Sarah.

04:19.600 --> 04:22.800
Jonathan's here. Guess where he's staying?
- Where?

04:25.600 --> 04:27.800
At Mom's!! Kitty, you realize

04:27.800 --> 04:30.100
Mom called him a cruel and ruthless businessman

04:30.100 --> 04:32.000
who'd kill his own grandmother to make a buck.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.500
I'm not talking if I'm on speaker.

04:33.700 --> 04:36.700
He's cooking dinner for everyone tonight.
- He cooks?

04:37.200 --> 04:39.800
I thought his kind of people only hired chefs.
- Wait, who's cooking?

04:39.800 --> 04:42.700
Ah, Uncle Saul and Tommy just walked in.

04:42.700 --> 04:45.600
Kitty's on the phone.
- Hey, Tommy. Hey, Uncle Saul.

04:45.600 --> 04:47.400
Hey, Kit.
- Hey, Kitty. Great show last night.

04:47.700 --> 04:49.600
Of course, as usual, you were right about Israel

04:49.600 --> 04:51.100
and wrong about everything else.

04:51.200 --> 04:53.400
Well, at least we'll always have Israel, Uncle Saul.

04:53.500 --> 04:54.400
Jonathan's back.

04:54.700 --> 04:56.300
He's staying at Mom's

04:56.300 --> 04:58.100
and cooking dinner for everyone tonight.

04:58.100 --> 05:01.100
Wait, your mother is letting him cook in her kitchen?

05:01.100 --> 05:03.200
Well, she's not entirely aware of it yet.

05:03.300 --> 05:05.300
It's a good thing Justin knows C.P.R.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.000
An interloper in my sister's kitchen?

05:07.000 --> 05:10.600
Justin should show up with oxygen and a defibrillator
- and sober.

05:11.300 --> 05:12.400
What?
- Hey...

05:12.800 --> 05:15.000
Hello? Hey, are you guys making faces? Come on!

05:15.000 --> 05:16.600
This is why I hate speakerphones.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.400
All right, I'm signing off. See you tonight.

05:18.400 --> 05:20.500
OK, bye, Kitty.
- Bye, Kitty.
- See ya, Kit.

05:20.500 --> 05:21.400
Bye.
- All right...

05:22.100 --> 05:23.500
The lawyer is in the conference room.

05:23.700 --> 05:24.500
She's waiting for us.

05:24.900 --> 05:26.600
Yeah, I still don't see why we need another lawyer.

05:26.800 --> 05:30.000
We have you.
- Yeah, well, the difference is I took a year of criminal law.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.300
This woman practices it for a living.
- Well, that makes me feel so much better.

05:37.000 --> 05:37.800
How are things?

05:37.900 --> 05:40.300
Oh, well, things are...

05:41.700 --> 05:43.200
Pretty excellent.

05:45.500 --> 05:46.300
Miss Walker?

05:46.500 --> 05:48.400
I'm Amber. I'm your new intern.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.900
If you need absolutely anything, just ask.

05:52.000 --> 05:52.900
Hi, Amber.

05:52.900 --> 05:56.100
Um, you know, you can, uh, call me Kitty.

05:56.100 --> 05:58.500
I'm just completely in awe of you.

05:58.700 --> 05:59.700
You're really amazing.

06:00.100 --> 06:02.700
You're, like, totally my role model.
- Oh, thanks.

06:02.900 --> 06:04.700
Except for, you know, your politics.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.100
Half-caf, half decaf, skim milk and The New York Times.

06:09.700 --> 06:11.300
Perfect. Thanks, Amber.

06:11.300 --> 06:12.600
Can I do anything else for you?

06:12.900 --> 06:14.900
No, I'm pretty excellent.

06:15.900 --> 06:16.700
Uh, Amber?

06:17.500 --> 06:18.300
Yeah?

06:19.100 --> 06:20.000
Is this your first day?

06:20.600 --> 06:24.600
No, I started yesterday afternoon. Bye.

06:26.300 --> 06:27.100
Oh, my God.

06:27.400 --> 06:28.400
You slept with her.

06:30.500 --> 06:31.500
Ugh.

06:31.500 --> 06:33.100
(woman) It turns out there's some good news.

06:33.400 --> 06:34.100
None of you have done anything

06:34.100 --> 06:36.200
that could get you in a jail cell...yet,

06:36.400 --> 06:40.300
even Saul, who's raised creative accounting to an art form.
- Thank you.

06:40.700 --> 06:42.800
So we don't have to call the U.S. Attorney

06:43.000 --> 06:44.400
and turn ourselves in?
- No.

06:44.900 --> 06:47.800
But the 5500's due at the end of the year.
- 5500?

06:47.800 --> 06:48.800
The financial statement.

06:49.200 --> 06:52.400
We have to list all of our assets in the pension fund.
- Or the lack thereof.

06:52.800 --> 06:54.600
If you don't report the shortfall, it's fraud.

06:54.600 --> 06:57.200
And that's what sends all of you to jail without passing "go."

06:58.000 --> 07:00.300
So what options do we have?

07:00.600 --> 07:02.400
Pretty simple -- you need $12 million

07:02.400 --> 07:04.100
to put back in the fund by the end of the year.

07:04.100 --> 07:06.200
Where are we gonna find $12 million?

07:06.400 --> 07:07.600
We find out where Dad put it.

07:07.900 --> 07:09.800
Thanks, Kevin. I hadn't thought of that.

07:10.100 --> 07:13.100
There's gotta be a way to figure out what William was doing.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.800
Somebody has to know where that money is.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.000
I can refer you to a forensic accountant

07:17.000 --> 07:20.400
who can look in confidence.
- What if the forensic guy can't find the money?

07:20.600 --> 07:23.000
"A"-- sell off major assets of the corporation,

07:23.400 --> 07:24.600
"B"-- declare bankruptcy,

07:25.200 --> 07:27.300
or "C"-- falsify the report and almost certainly see

07:27.300 --> 07:28.700
the inside of a jail cell.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.500
or "D"-- win the lotto.

07:37.600 --> 07:38.400
OK.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.500
<font color="#ffff00">Subtitles by J&J Subtitles</font>

07:40.500 --> 07:42.200
<font color="#ffff00">jeralvsut@hotmail.com</font>

07:42.240 --> 07:44.790
Jonathan, if you're here, you got some faxes--

07:44.940 --> 07:46.640
about 30 pages worth.

07:47.640 --> 07:49.940
I-I had to refill the machine with paper.

07:50.540 --> 07:52.540
Thank you, Nora. You can just leave them right there.

07:54.040 --> 07:54.840
Groceries?

07:55.040 --> 07:58.240
Do you have some sort of special dietary needs I'm unaware of?

07:58.240 --> 08:00.440
No, Kitty didn't tell you? I'm cooking.

08:00.940 --> 08:02.940
Where?
- Here. Tonight.

08:03.840 --> 08:04.440
I thought it would be a great way

08:04.440 --> 08:05.840
to say hello to everyone again.

08:07.040 --> 08:07.940
It's the least I could do.

08:07.940 --> 08:11.540
Oh, that is so thoughful. Completely unnecesary.

08:11.540 --> 08:13.540
I-I don't think anyone can come.

08:13.540 --> 08:15.740
It's so hard to get them all together during the week.

08:16.040 --> 08:17.940
Well, as far as I know, everyone's coming.

08:18.440 --> 08:20.640
Oh. Great.

08:20.640 --> 08:21.840
I've got two more bags in the car.

08:23.340 --> 08:24.540
No peeking, Nora.
- Oh.

08:24.840 --> 08:25.840
It's a surprise.

08:28.440 --> 08:30.540
You love those surprises.

08:32.539 --> 08:34.240
(Kitty) "We found the hunt thrilling

08:34.240 --> 08:35.140
and the business lucrative"?

08:35.140 --> 08:37.039
You know, I don't like that. I don't wanna talk about that.

08:37.039 --> 08:38.039
I'd rather stick with the whiskey.

08:40.140 --> 08:41.039
(laughing)

08:41.740 --> 08:43.539
Oh, I can't believe it.

08:44.340 --> 08:45.540
OK, thanks.

08:47.940 --> 08:48.640
That's good.

08:48.640 --> 08:49.840
I'll talk to you later.
- OK, bye bye.

08:52.340 --> 08:53.940
Allow me to explain something.

08:53.940 --> 08:56.040
You can't just go blithely around screwing women

08:56.040 --> 08:57.440
in the workplace and then flaunt it.

08:57.440 --> 08:59.040
You could get sued. You could get fired.

08:59.040 --> 09:01.740
She could get fired. It's completely irresponsible

09:01.740 --> 09:03.940
and frankly...gross.

09:03.940 --> 09:06.540
When did you become the guardian of workplace morality?

09:07.440 --> 09:09.740
Oh, it's not about me, Pal. I couldn't care less.

09:10.040 --> 09:12.440
It's the -- the lefty political correctness police

09:12.440 --> 09:13.240
who are gonna march in here

09:13.240 --> 09:14.840
and start screaming sexual harassment,

09:14.840 --> 09:16.840
and then you're really gonna be screwed.
- What do you care?

09:16.840 --> 09:18.340
Didn't your little boyfriend come back to town

09:18.340 --> 09:19.640
and move in with you and Mommy?

09:20.540 --> 09:22.140
You know, I would really appreciate it

09:22.140 --> 09:23.540
If you could refrain from listening in

09:23.540 --> 09:27.380
on my private phone conversations.
- Then quit having private phone conversations

09:27.380 --> 09:29.740
in your irritating cell phone voice in the workplace.

09:30.340 --> 09:31.140
And for what it's worth,

09:32.140 --> 09:34.640
I haven't slept with her...yet.

09:35.740 --> 09:38.140
And if and when we do choose to have sex,

09:38.440 --> 09:40.440
it will be an act between two consenting adults.

09:40.440 --> 09:41.940
She's not an adult, Warren.

09:42.240 --> 09:43.640
She's a susceptible young intern

09:43.640 --> 09:46.540
who happens to be impressed with your position and your power

09:46.540 --> 09:48.840
and your ill-informed, touchy-feely politics.

09:49.040 --> 09:50.540
Is there nothing about that scenario

09:50.540 --> 09:51.840
that is familiar to you?

09:52.340 --> 09:55.440
Hmm...no. Can't think of a thing.

09:58.040 --> 10:00.440
That's it? I'm done? I'm not going on the stage?

10:00.840 --> 10:02.040
It's a witness stand.

10:02.340 --> 10:03.740
And, no, they settled ten minutes ago.

10:03.840 --> 10:06.240
But, uh, you can take comfort in the thought

10:06.240 --> 10:07.440
it was your impending testimony

10:07.440 --> 10:10.540
that put the fear of God in them.
- I'm crushed.

10:10.540 --> 10:12.240
I feel like an understudy who never got to go on.
- Sorry.

10:12.840 --> 10:16.440
No, um, I'm sorry for the other night.

10:16.640 --> 10:19.340
What other night?
- The movies? "Two For the Road?"

10:19.340 --> 10:20.540
Although, in our case, it was four,

10:20.540 --> 10:24.040
if your count your mother and my friend.
- Your friend?

10:24.840 --> 10:26.840
You were holding hands, so unless he was a blind friend,

10:26.840 --> 10:28.040
I would assume he's your boyfriend.

10:28.040 --> 10:30.440
I know you were hurt.
- No, that would imply I cared.

10:32.040 --> 10:32.940
When can we go out again?

10:35.140 --> 10:37.440
I don't ask guys out twice who are currently involved.

10:37.740 --> 10:39.140
I'd imagine you'd understand that,

10:39.140 --> 10:40.540
being the poster boy for monogamy.

10:40.540 --> 10:41.940
There is no harm in dating around.

10:41.940 --> 10:45.440
When I'm exclusive, I'm exclusive.
- So are you?

10:47.040 --> 10:47.840
Exclusive?

10:47.840 --> 10:49.340
Well, we're not registered, if that's what you mean.

10:49.340 --> 10:52.340
and P.S. -- you were the one who cancelled on me

10:52.340 --> 10:54.740
to hang out with your mom, so I'm the one

10:54.740 --> 10:57.140
who should be offended and a little weirded out.

11:00.140 --> 11:01.040
OK, fine.

11:01.540 --> 11:02.340
How's tomorrow night?

11:02.540 --> 11:04.240
My boyfriend and I might have plans, but I'll check.

11:04.240 --> 11:05.540
He can come, too. He was kinda hot.

11:05.840 --> 11:07.840
How's 7:30?
- Geriatric. Let's say 9:00.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.840
It's cassoulet. It's a French peasant food.

11:17.840 --> 11:19.040
It's kind of a stew.

11:19.040 --> 11:22.440
Except that every chef has co-opted this

11:22.440 --> 11:23.840
all over the entire nation.

11:25.040 --> 11:26.440
Well, I'd like to make a toast.

11:26.740 --> 11:30.540
To Nora, who has kindly offered to endure the encroachment

11:30.540 --> 11:32.240
of me and my business in her lovely home.

11:32.740 --> 11:34.340
Thank you.
- (Saul) To Nora.

11:34.640 --> 11:35.440
(all) Cheers.

11:35.540 --> 11:36.640
And if you keep cooking like this,

11:36.640 --> 11:37.840
you can stay as long as you'd like.

11:40.540 --> 11:42.040
Kitty, could you get some more wine?
- Mmm.

11:42.240 --> 11:44.740
No, no, no, no. Please. Please.

11:45.240 --> 11:47.440
Let me do something. I can't just sit around

11:47.740 --> 11:49.240
and do nothing in my own house.

11:52.340 --> 11:53.340
Oh, ah!

11:56.140 --> 11:58.840
How do I say, "I told you so" in French?

11:59.140 --> 12:00.540
<i>Baiser ma derriere.</i>
(literally: "Kiss my ass")

12:01.040 --> 12:02.040
<i>Baiser ma derriere.</i>

12:05.840 --> 12:08.540
Uh, excuse us. It's time for Paige's insulin.

12:08.940 --> 12:10.140
Do I have to?

12:10.140 --> 12:11.640
Come on, Sweetie. 
- Wish us luck.

12:13.240 --> 12:13.840
(Joe) Come on.

12:18.040 --> 12:20.240
Finally, our peasant has arrived.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.940
You look so nice!

12:21.940 --> 12:24.540
Don't you look great? Where'd you get the new suit?

12:24.540 --> 12:26.340
Oh, it's my bellboy uniform.

12:26.540 --> 12:27.740
(Saul) I thought they'd give you something

12:27.740 --> 12:29.340
with epaulets and a hat.
- Yeah, you know what?

12:29.340 --> 12:31.940
I wore that in Afghanistan, thanks.
- Ah, very funny.

12:35.640 --> 12:37.040
Still the silent treatment, huh, Bro?

12:37.340 --> 12:39.640
It's no silent treatment. I just don't have anything to say.

12:41.540 --> 12:43.240
Jonathan, what exactly do you do?

12:44.440 --> 12:45.940
I'm a hedge fund manager.

12:45.940 --> 12:47.740
Oh, come on. He's being modest.

12:47.740 --> 12:48.240
I googled you.

12:48.240 --> 12:50.440
He's one of the top hedge fund managers in the country.

12:50.640 --> 12:51.540
You can't get through

12:51.540 --> 12:53.340
the doors of his office with less than $5 million.

12:53.840 --> 12:57.140
Wow, really? Maybe you could help me with my 401k.

12:59.040 --> 13:02.340
So your business is making the very rich obscenely rich?

13:02.440 --> 13:04.140
Nora...finish your stew.

13:04.940 --> 13:06.640
I'm sorry. All right. I'm eating.

13:07.040 --> 13:08.440
I invest wealthy people's money

13:08.440 --> 13:10.040
in companies that need capital to grow.

13:10.440 --> 13:13.440
If I pick well, everybody wins, including the employees.

13:13.640 --> 13:15.140
Except for the ones on minimum wage.

13:15.140 --> 13:17.740
Wages are set by the marketplace, Nora.
- Oh, here we go!

13:17.940 --> 13:20.040
The wisdom of the almighty market.

13:20.240 --> 13:22.740
Mom, the minimum wage is a political conceit.

13:22.740 --> 13:24.840
He's not a politician. He's a businessman.

13:24.840 --> 13:26.040
I know. I know.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.540
I guess this is his idea of clever irony--

13:28.540 --> 13:29.840
eating like a poor peasant

13:30.040 --> 13:32.640
while we discuss his bazillion dollar hedge fund.

13:33.440 --> 13:34.540
Oh, damn it, Mom.

13:35.840 --> 13:36.940
I'm sorry.

13:38.240 --> 13:39.640
(Paige) Ow! Stop!

13:41.640 --> 13:43.340
No! It hurts!
- It's OK.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.940
That really hurt me!
- Daddy didn't mean to hurt--

13:45.940 --> 13:47.440
Please, I don't like this.

13:47.440 --> 13:48.940
I got it. I got it. Here.
- Stop it!

13:48.940 --> 13:50.940
Give me this. Give me this. Let me get over here.

13:51.140 --> 13:52.440
All right, Paige. Can you look me right in the eyes?

13:52.440 --> 13:54.240
Right, look me right in the eyes and make this face.

13:54.440 --> 13:56.540
Look right here, OK? Can you make a funny face for me?

13:56.540 --> 13:57.140
Like this... (growls)

14:00.840 --> 14:03.840
You are all done. You did so good!

14:03.840 --> 14:05.540
Come on, let's bring you back in there.

14:06.140 --> 14:07.040
You did so good.

14:07.040 --> 14:09.040
I'm so proud of you. Oh, my gosh!

14:09.540 --> 14:10.840
You're so heavy! No more food for you!

14:11.940 --> 14:13.340
What? Show's over. There's nothing to see here.

14:13.340 --> 14:14.340
Right, little girl?

14:14.940 --> 14:15.740
You did so good!

14:17.640 --> 14:19.240
God, you're getting heavy. There you go.

14:24.740 --> 14:25.140
What?

14:25.140 --> 14:26.540
It's harder when you're under fire.

14:27.440 --> 14:29.940
I'm gonna get you some band-aids, Paige.

14:30.340 --> 14:31.140
You OK?

14:34.640 --> 14:37.140
Wow. Who was that masked man?

14:42.640 --> 14:46.140
Yes, yes, yes. You're absolutely right!

14:46.440 --> 14:48.640
Oh, my gosh!

14:48.640 --> 14:50.940
You're like a contractor and designer all in one.

14:51.340 --> 14:54.840
I just love this cork flooring. Who knew?

14:54.840 --> 14:55.440
Thanks for lunch.

14:55.440 --> 14:58.040
Oh, David, could you please move your truck?
- Oh, sure.

14:58.240 --> 15:00.140
No. Oh, no, David, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, please.

15:00.140 --> 15:01.440
I want Kevin to see what you're doing.

15:01.440 --> 15:04.340
Kevin, look at this -- David's gonna take out

15:04.340 --> 15:07.540
this entire wall and fill it with French doors.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.140
Wow, that seems expensive.

15:09.240 --> 15:11.040
You know, I might have some door frames left over

15:11.040 --> 15:15.840
from the Sperlings' Restaurant job.
- Ah, I love the Sperlings'. How are they doing?

15:15.840 --> 15:16.140
Well, they're opening a restaurant, Mom.

15:16.140 --> 15:17.440
I'm sure they're broke and medicated

15:17.440 --> 15:18.840
to within an inch of their lives.

15:18.940 --> 15:21.140
What are they calling it again?
- Sperlings.

15:22.340 --> 15:23.440
How clever.

15:24.840 --> 15:27.840
You know what? They sent me an invitation to the opening.

15:27.840 --> 15:28.640
I'm so bad.

15:28.640 --> 15:30.840
I completely forgot all about it. When is it?

15:31.040 --> 15:32.640
Tonight.
- Tonight?

15:32.740 --> 15:35.040
Oh, no. Tonight?

15:35.040 --> 15:37.740
Oh, Kevin?
- What?

15:38.040 --> 15:39.339
Can I --?
- No.

15:39.340 --> 15:41.140
I can't ask you?
- No.

15:42.240 --> 15:44.740
My son and I are no longer seeing each other socially.

15:44.740 --> 15:45.640
It seems to be inapprop--

15:45.640 --> 15:47.540
All right, I'm not gonna say anymore.

15:47.540 --> 15:49.040
Well, why don't you go with me, Nora?

15:49.240 --> 15:51.540
I'm down for a plus one and right now there's no one,

15:51.840 --> 15:53.740
so...
- Oh, well...

15:54.340 --> 15:57.040
that... sure is a good idea.

15:57.240 --> 15:59.740
I mean, I was invited, too,

15:59.740 --> 16:01.540
so it wouldn't be like I was your "one."

16:01.540 --> 16:03.140
You know, I'm my own "one."

16:03.140 --> 16:05.540
We would be your "one" and my "one"--

16:05.540 --> 16:07.240
Just two "ones," you know, going.

16:07.240 --> 16:10.340
I could meet you there even-- would be a good idea.

16:11.440 --> 16:12.440
Great.
- OK.

16:12.440 --> 16:13.140
I'll go move my truck.

16:13.140 --> 16:17.140
Thank you. Mm-hmm.

16:20.640 --> 16:21.440
What?

16:21.540 --> 16:23.040
You were just asked out on a date.

16:23.440 --> 16:26.140
I was most certainly not asked out on a date.

16:26.940 --> 16:29.440
Don't you dare mention this to your sisters.

16:30.040 --> 16:31.140
Who?
- Kevin...

16:31.140 --> 16:32.240
Me?
- Yes.

16:32.340 --> 16:33.840
Cross my heart.

16:34.340 --> 16:35.340
Kitty Walker.

16:38.640 --> 16:40.540
That is so incredibly nice of you!

16:41.340 --> 16:42.240
Hi, guys.

16:43.240 --> 16:45.240
Warren is treating me to dinner after the show.

16:45.740 --> 16:48.040
Yeah, it's kind of a tradition. After the first week--

16:48.040 --> 16:49.440
I like to take the interns out.

16:49.440 --> 16:51.240
Oh, you know what? I heard about that.

16:51.240 --> 16:55.240
You've been doing that since, like, the early 80s.
- Not quite that long.

16:55.640 --> 16:58.240
We're going to McKendree's
- Oh, McKendree's.

16:58.340 --> 17:01.640
You know what, Warren? We ate there once together, didn't we?

17:01.640 --> 17:03.040
I'd read about McKendree's in the magazines,

17:03.040 --> 17:04.740
so I'm, like, totally psyched.

17:05.339 --> 17:06.740
Oh, my God, what am I gonna wear?

17:06.839 --> 17:08.740
You know what? I have an idea. Wow.

17:09.040 --> 17:10.940
My boyfriend and I were gonna go out

17:10.940 --> 17:13.640
and grab dinner after the show. Why don't we all go together?

17:14.339 --> 17:16.839
No way!
- Are you kidding?
- No.

17:17.140 --> 17:19.440
I'm going to dinner with both stars of "Red, White & Blue"??

17:19.839 --> 17:23.839
Why not? It would really be a lot of fun.

17:23.940 --> 17:25.740
Oh, my God, I so gotta go call my roommate!

17:25.940 --> 17:27.240
Tell her you're gonna be home early.

17:30.240 --> 17:31.440
Whoa, whoa. So--so what,

17:31.440 --> 17:34.140
you're the, uh, dental dam of workplace relationships now?

17:34.140 --> 17:35.940
Warren, it is so obvious what you're trying to do.

17:36.040 --> 17:39.040
What <i>I'm</i> trying to do? 
- Yeah, you're still upset about what happened between us,

17:39.040 --> 17:41.240
so you're trying to get back at me by sleeping with the intern.

17:41.240 --> 17:43.040
Well, the problem is, is that that girl is gonna

17:43.040 --> 17:44.040
get destroyed by this,

17:44.040 --> 17:46.240
and I'm not gonna have that on my conscience.
- So you think my wanting

17:46.240 --> 17:48.840
to sleep with Amber is about me sleeping with you and not about me wanting

17:48.840 --> 17:50.140
to sleep with Amber?
- Clearly.

17:50.940 --> 17:53.840
Wow. Well, after you get your head examined,

17:54.040 --> 17:56.240
Maybe you might wanna check with your boyfriend, uh, Jonathan,

17:56.740 --> 17:59.340
and see how he feels about this little double date.
- Well, Jonathan

17:59.840 --> 18:00.440
is not that insecure.

18:00.740 --> 18:02.140
Gosh, what a guy.

18:02.840 --> 18:06.440
Hey, you guys see that new intern? Smokin'!

18:07.640 --> 18:08.540
Don't you think?

18:10.440 --> 18:13.140
We could see off the trucks to shore up the ranch operation.

18:13.240 --> 18:15.840
You won't need ranch operations if you liquidate the orchards.

18:15.840 --> 18:17.540
You think we should sell the orchards?

18:17.840 --> 18:19.140
That's our core business.

18:20.340 --> 18:22.340
Sarah, how are you?
- Jonathan?

18:22.540 --> 18:24.540
I was just telling Tommy I don't think you guys should be

18:24.540 --> 18:26.240
too quick to sell off the distribution arm.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.740
Tommy, could I have a word with you, please?

18:29.740 --> 18:31.440
Sarah, don't--
- Excuse me, Jonathan.

18:31.440 --> 18:34.440
I need to talk to my brother.
- I understand.

18:39.040 --> 18:41.040
Tommy, what did you--?
- I'm not an idiot.

18:41.040 --> 18:42.740
I didn't talk abou the pension fund.

18:42.740 --> 18:44.540
But if we're gonna auction off parts of Ojai,

18:44.540 --> 18:46.340
I wanna make sure we sell the right parts

18:46.340 --> 18:48.440
and Jonathan knows, I mean, he--
- Well, I haven't decided that that's what I wanna do.

18:48.440 --> 18:51.740
What do you wanna do? You know, file for bankruptcy,

18:51.740 --> 18:55.040
go to jail?
- Back off, Tommy.

18:55.040 --> 18:57.240
Do you have any idea what I'm going through?

18:57.240 --> 18:58.440
I just came from Paige's school,

18:58.740 --> 18:59.840
where the nurse lost

18:59.840 --> 19:01.840
my diabetic daughter's blood testing kit.

19:01.840 --> 19:02.640
I've had two months from hell,

19:02.640 --> 19:04.740
and I don't need you undermining me at every turn.

19:04.940 --> 19:08.440
Sarah, you're the only one with the authority to fix this.

19:09.140 --> 19:10.240
You have to own that.

19:12.440 --> 19:16.440
Stop stalling. You have to act.

19:22.640 --> 19:24.540
Ooh, what are you all dressed up for?

19:25.640 --> 19:26.440
I'm not dressed up.

19:27.240 --> 19:28.640
You're wearing a push-up bra.

19:29.840 --> 19:32.640
This is not a pu-- it's a French cup.

19:32.640 --> 19:34.240
I got it on sale.

19:34.240 --> 19:35.840
You know, it wouldn't hurt you

19:35.840 --> 19:37.240
to wear a bra every now and then.

19:37.840 --> 19:39.840
I hear you have a date with David Morton.

19:40.940 --> 19:41.940
I'm gonna kill Kevin.

19:42.140 --> 19:43.140
And it's not a date.

19:43.640 --> 19:44.840
I would ask you to come along,

19:44.840 --> 19:46.640
but apparently, you're on your way to McKendree's.

19:50.040 --> 19:51.840
You're not the only one that talks to Kevin.

19:51.840 --> 19:53.740
And I must say I find it a bit bizarre,

19:53.940 --> 19:56.440
this Darwinian dinner date of yours.

19:56.440 --> 19:59.740
What? Do the two of them butt horns like a pair of rams

19:59.740 --> 20:01.440
and whichever one is left standing

20:01.440 --> 20:03.340
at the end of the evening gets to take you home?

20:03.540 --> 20:04.940
We're all civilized adults, Mother,

20:04.940 --> 20:07.440
and Jonathan knows exactly how I feel about him.

20:08.140 --> 20:09.640
Well, I wish you would explain it to me

20:09.640 --> 20:11.440
because I don't understand the attraction.

20:11.640 --> 20:14.240
You know, Mom, if you feel so strongly about Jonathan

20:14.240 --> 20:17.240
why did you invite him to stay here?
- I was being courteous.

20:17.240 --> 20:18.940
No, you were being controlling

20:19.040 --> 20:20.240
because you don't want me to leave.

20:20.240 --> 20:22.440
And if I'm here, you can pick on me at will.

20:22.740 --> 20:23.940
Kitty, that's absolutely--

20:23.940 --> 20:26.140
I have been nothing but nice to you since--
- Nice?!

20:26.140 --> 20:28.540
I have been so nice!
- Nice? Attacking my boyfriend in the middle of a dinner

20:28.540 --> 20:30.640
that he made for the entire family is--

20:30.640 --> 20:32.440
A dinner you conveniently forgot to tell me about.

20:32.440 --> 20:32.940
Well,--

20:32.940 --> 20:33.540
You set me up.

20:33.540 --> 20:36.540
and, you know, while we're on the subject, why do you do it?
- What?

20:36.540 --> 20:39.040
Why do you belittle ever single guy that I've ever brought home

20:39.040 --> 20:40.740
since-- since what, seventh grade?

20:42.240 --> 20:45.840
No one on Earth wants you to find a decent boyfriend

20:45.840 --> 20:48.140
more than I do, but you seem to have a knack

20:48.140 --> 20:50.840
for picking self-satisfied, smug men

20:50.840 --> 20:54.540
who have pathologically high self-esteem--

20:54.540 --> 20:57.640
Handsome, arrogant, self-centered Republicans--

20:57.640 --> 20:58.840
Are you talking about Jonathan,

20:58.840 --> 21:01.640
or are we talking about Dad?

21:03.640 --> 21:06.340
If I thought you loved Jonathan, I wouldn't say a thing.

21:15.740 --> 21:17.340
Hey.
- Hi.

21:18.040 --> 21:19.840
Wow, you look great.

21:19.840 --> 21:23.240
Oh, no, you're-- You, of course, look wonderful.

21:23.540 --> 21:25.340
You look so different like this.

21:26.140 --> 21:28.140
Not that you don't look great in your khakis

21:28.140 --> 21:30.340
or whatever it was you were wearing at the house.

21:30.340 --> 21:32.440
I really don't remember what you were wearing at the house.

21:32.440 --> 21:33.740
I wasn't paying attention.

21:33.940 --> 21:35.340
I never notice what people are wearing.

21:35.340 --> 21:37.240
I would be the worst witness at a trial.

21:37.240 --> 21:40.340
Everybody tells me that. They all just say I'd be bad.

21:42.540 --> 21:47.890
Oh, David, oh, you've done just a wonderful job.

21:51.140 --> 21:52.040
Holy Mother of God.

21:52.540 --> 21:53.440
(woman) Good evening, Mr. Morton.

21:53.740 --> 21:55.140
Right this way, Ma'am.

21:55.140 --> 21:55.940
Thanks.

21:58.040 --> 22:03.640
Saul? You look a little ashen. Did you get a bad scallop?

22:03.640 --> 22:04.740
No, it's not the scallop.

22:23.440 --> 22:24.240
Good evening.

22:25.640 --> 22:27.240
Oh, uh, welcome back.

22:27.740 --> 22:28.940
Can I get you some cocktails?

22:29.140 --> 22:30.140
Yeah.
- Yes.

22:30.140 --> 22:33.040
Dry martini for you?
- Uh, no, no.

22:33.040 --> 22:35.640
No, I'll just have a glass of red wine, thank you.

22:35.840 --> 22:39.140
Why don't I order champagne, since this is a celebration?

22:39.740 --> 22:42.440
Veuve clicquot la Grande Dame, and put a second bottle on ice.

22:42.740 --> 22:43.740
Yes, sir, right away.

22:45.840 --> 22:48.340
Would it be weird if I took a picture of you two together?

22:49.840 --> 22:50.540
Sure.

22:51.240 --> 22:52.340
I promised my mom.

22:52.940 --> 22:55.640
Just right there like you are, only closer.

22:57.740 --> 22:58.840
You know, it's so funny,

22:58.840 --> 23:01.140
because the whole world thinks you guys hate each other.

23:01.140 --> 23:02.640
Why don't you get in the photograph, Amber,

23:02.640 --> 23:04.840
and I'll take it?
- Oh, yeah, aswesome!

23:08.940 --> 23:10.940
Uh-oh, you're, uh, you're getting a call.

23:11.740 --> 23:12.440
Oh!

23:15.340 --> 23:18.340
Oh, it's my best friend, Jill. I'll be right back.

23:18.940 --> 23:20.540
Jill? We just got here.

23:20.540 --> 23:22.440
Oh, my God, it's like, a super nice restaurant.

23:23.440 --> 23:25.840
So, Jonathan, how, uh, how are you liking L.A. so far?

23:26.440 --> 23:28.640
Listen, I always prefer to be direct with people.

23:29.140 --> 23:31.140
So, let's just identify the elephant in the room,

23:31.140 --> 23:31.940
shall we?

23:33.140 --> 23:33.940
I know about you two.

23:35.140 --> 23:37.040
Well, aren't we modern?

23:37.040 --> 23:40.340
And Kitty is a beautiful, smart and sexy woman.

23:40.640 --> 23:41.540
So I don't blame anyone

23:41.540 --> 23:42.440
for falling for her.

23:44.140 --> 23:45.040
(Kitty) So...

23:45.440 --> 23:46.640
I'm thinking pork chops.

23:46.640 --> 23:49.440
No, Jonathan, you're right. She is --

23:49.440 --> 23:50.540
She is all those things.

23:50.540 --> 23:52.040
But you are wrong about one thing.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.240
I never fell for Kitty.

23:54.840 --> 23:57.140
What happened between us was nothing.

23:57.740 --> 23:59.040
It was a mistake,

23:59.040 --> 24:00.740
and, uh, we should leave it at that.

24:04.340 --> 24:05.940
You guys wanna go to Bar Marmont after this?

24:06.540 --> 24:08.040
Oh, you won't feel old or anything.

24:08.040 --> 24:09.240
People of all ages go there.

24:11.340 --> 24:15.340
Oh, it is so hard to decide.

24:16.140 --> 24:18.240
I think I'll have the sea bass.

24:18.240 --> 24:20.340
I'm sorry. I just served the last one,

24:20.640 --> 24:22.040
but the swordfish is wonderful.

24:22.540 --> 24:25.540
Fine, I'll have swordfish.
- I will have the same.

24:25.640 --> 24:26.840
Very good.
-(David) Thanks.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.940
There's an awful lot of mercury in swordfish.

24:28.940 --> 24:30.840
I hope I don't turn into a thermometer.

24:33.740 --> 24:34.740
If you wanna leave, Nora...

24:34.940 --> 24:36.740
No, no, no, no, why?

24:36.740 --> 24:38.440
Just because my brother is over there

24:38.440 --> 24:39.940
with the woman who was sleeping with my husband?

24:39.940 --> 24:43.140
I'd rather have another...watermelon martini.

24:43.940 --> 24:45.240
Watermelon -- can you believe it?

24:45.640 --> 24:47.640
In my day, martinis were made with gin.

24:48.040 --> 24:49.740
Vodka was the big experiment.

24:52.640 --> 24:53.440
Saul?

24:54.340 --> 24:56.640
Would you please stop looking over there?

24:56.640 --> 24:58.240
This is ridiculous.

24:58.840 --> 25:00.640
This is not an easy situation, Holly.

25:01.040 --> 25:02.340
I understand that.

25:03.540 --> 25:06.840
But I don't wanna be anxious every time I go out on a date.

25:08.040 --> 25:10.240
Is that what tonight is, a date?

25:11.140 --> 25:14.740
Well, if such a thing is possible.

25:15.540 --> 25:16.740
Of course, it's possible.

25:19.740 --> 25:20.840
You look beautiful tonight.

25:21.340 --> 25:22.140
Thank you.

25:22.840 --> 25:26.240
I was beginning to think I got all dressed up for nothing.

25:26.640 --> 25:29.340
You look just the way you looked when you made "Girls A-Go-Go."

25:29.340 --> 25:31.540
"Girls A-Go-Go"?

25:31.940 --> 25:33.440
You did not see that movie!
- I did.

25:34.840 --> 25:36.640
No! Oh...

25:36.940 --> 25:38.940
I wish that I could rent

25:38.940 --> 25:41.140
old movies of you, Saul.

25:41.740 --> 25:45.240
You're such an enigma.
- The movies would be boring.

25:45.740 --> 25:47.640
Just because you've led a fabulous life,

25:47.640 --> 25:49.240
don't imagine that everyone else has.

25:49.540 --> 25:52.840
I think you mythologize me, sometimes, Saul.

25:55.040 --> 25:56.940
I'm really very ordinary.

25:57.140 --> 25:57.940
Hardly.

26:02.440 --> 26:05.140
For a long time, I didn't know about you and William.

26:05.450 --> 26:07.200
There are probably so many things we didn't know,

26:08.790 --> 26:10.790
so many secrets he only shared with you.

26:15.090 --> 26:17.090
We loved each other very much.

26:19.290 --> 26:20.790
That's the only secret I know.

26:23.590 --> 26:24.490
Yeah.

26:26.290 --> 26:29.990
Look, I-I didn't mean to infer that I could never--

26:29.990 --> 26:32.890
No, no, Holly, please, I understand. It's all right.

26:34.290 --> 26:35.390
You want to have another drink?

26:35.690 --> 26:36.490
Sure.

26:36.790 --> 26:40.190
This time I'm gonna have a proper martini.

26:41.590 --> 26:43.390
With me, coming out was never an issue.

26:43.390 --> 26:44.490
I was so gay so quickly,

26:44.490 --> 26:47.190
there was no use in arguing with anybody about it.

26:47.190 --> 26:48.990
With you, I imagine it was more like pulling teeth.

26:50.590 --> 26:53.590
No, I was -- I was just a late bloomer, that's all.

26:53.590 --> 26:56.090
I didn't come into this world loving clothes

26:56.090 --> 26:57.090
or musical theater.

26:57.690 --> 27:00.390
I was keeping it all pretty much to myself until senior year

27:00.390 --> 27:03.190
when I hooked up with this guy Danny McCullough in his attic.

27:03.190 --> 27:04.090
Why are you whispering?

27:06.390 --> 27:07.390
I'm -- I'm not.

27:08.690 --> 27:09.890
Anyway, um, Danny's older sister, Abigail,

27:09.890 --> 27:11.690
was best friends with Kitty, and that Halloween

27:11.690 --> 27:14.490
Danny decided to dress up as a French chamber maid.
- Nice.

27:14.890 --> 27:16.690
Abigail, no fool, figures things out.

27:16.690 --> 27:18.090
She and Danny have a heart-to-heart.

27:18.090 --> 27:19.390
Of course, Danny tells her everything.

27:19.390 --> 27:20.790
Abigail tells Kitty.

27:20.790 --> 27:23.690
Kitty-bum-bum-bum confronts me.
- What did you do?

27:24.190 --> 27:25.890
What could I do? I couldn't very well deny it.

27:25.890 --> 27:28.490
I made her swear a vow of secrecy, but by Christmas,

27:28.490 --> 27:30.890
she told all my brothers and sisters.

27:30.890 --> 27:32.790
Anyway, when I finally told Mom, she immediately joined

27:32.790 --> 27:34.790
Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays.
- Oh...

27:35.190 --> 27:38.090
No, no, "oh." I became her cause celebre.

27:38.090 --> 27:40.590
I was an exchange student in my own home.

27:42.390 --> 27:43.790
How did you get so cute?

27:44.890 --> 27:45.990
I was born this way.

27:47.290 --> 27:48.290
What's your excuse?

27:49.090 --> 27:53.090
*When you're gone all the colors fade*

27:55.690 --> 27:59.690
*When you're gone*

28:01.090 --> 28:04.490
*No New Year's Day parade*

28:04.490 --> 28:08.490
*You're gone*

28:10.190 --> 28:14.190
*Colors seem to fade*

28:16.890 --> 28:20.890
*Colors seem to fade*

28:21.090 --> 28:21.990
I love this part.

28:23.290 --> 28:24.990
when you look at someone and they don't look away.

28:35.690 --> 28:37.290
Could you please pass the chutney?

28:46.790 --> 28:48.890
Hello.

28:49.090 --> 28:50.490
Who are you?

28:50.690 --> 28:53.490
You couldn't be my brother, could you?

28:53.490 --> 28:55.990
Not if you're here with her tonight.

28:55.990 --> 28:56.890
And who might you be?

28:57.590 --> 28:58.590
You look like my sister

28:58.590 --> 28:59.890
but, of course, that's impossible.

28:59.890 --> 29:02.090
You see, my sister's husband just died,

29:02.990 --> 29:04.390
and you seem to be on a date.

29:04.490 --> 29:08.490
I am not here on a date. That is Dave the contractor.

29:08.590 --> 29:10.590
Whereas you are here on a date.

29:10.590 --> 29:13.690
If I am, then you are.
- No, the difference is

29:13.690 --> 29:15.390
you told me you had feelings for her.

29:15.390 --> 29:18.290
I never told you I had feelings for Dave the contractor.

29:18.290 --> 29:21.390
We are sitting at that table, minding our own business.

29:21.390 --> 29:22.490
What do you want from me?

29:22.690 --> 29:25.390
Fine. Shut up, then. We're both grown-ups.

29:25.390 --> 29:26.890
I don't wanna talk about it anymore.

29:31.590 --> 29:32.590
David...

29:33.090 --> 29:35.290
I hope you don't take this the wrong way,

29:35.390 --> 29:37.590
but would you drive me home tonight?

29:38.390 --> 29:41.490
I seem to have had too many modern martinis.

29:41.990 --> 29:42.690
Of course I will.

29:44.290 --> 29:45.490
I'm sorry, David.

29:46.690 --> 29:49.590
This is the first date I've had in 40 years.

29:50.490 --> 29:52.290
I'm just a little bit nervous.

29:52.590 --> 29:53.590
Nora, I hope there--

29:53.590 --> 29:54.990
there isn't a misunderstanding here.

29:56.990 --> 29:58.790
We've had lunch together over a hundred times,

29:58.790 --> 30:00.390
and I didn't think this was any different.

30:01.290 --> 30:03.390
No! Oh, no!

30:03.390 --> 30:04.490
Oh, no, no, no.

30:04.690 --> 30:07.290
Oh, I was teasing. It was a joke.

30:09.290 --> 30:11.790
I don't know where my comic timing is tonight.

30:11.790 --> 30:12.890
Psst. Gone.

30:17.490 --> 30:19.590
All right, I just gave her the shot and read her a story,

30:19.590 --> 30:21.390
and lucky for you, you're not being charged for either.

30:21.790 --> 30:23.890
Oh, thank you. You know, after witnessing

30:23.890 --> 30:25.990
your miraculous talents the other night,

30:25.990 --> 30:28.290
I figured Paige would appreciate the surprise.

30:28.390 --> 30:30.090
Well, there is more where that came from.

30:31.690 --> 30:32.389
What's that?

30:32.390 --> 30:34.989
This is saline solution. Don't worry. It's harmless.

30:34.990 --> 30:36.790
Is it for Paige?

30:37.290 --> 30:39.290
Nope, it's for you. You're gonna inject me.

30:42.590 --> 30:44.090
You haven't given her a shot yet, have you?

30:45.090 --> 30:47.390
She's my daughter. I don't want to hurt her.

30:47.390 --> 30:48.590
You're gonna hurt her, Sarah.

30:48.590 --> 30:50.590
The first 10, 15 times, you're gonna hurt her.

30:51.090 --> 30:52.690
But after the 20th time, you know, you start to get

30:52.690 --> 30:53.890
the hang of it, and after a month,

30:53.890 --> 30:54.790
you know, she won't even notice.

30:54.790 --> 30:56.290
But you're never gonna get there if you don't give her the shot.

30:56.290 --> 30:59.690
So come here. All right, the first thing

30:59.690 --> 31:00.890
you wanna do is grab the skin, right?

31:00.890 --> 31:03.090
You want to go in perpendicular, but the trick is

31:03.390 --> 31:05.090
to prick fast and deep just like you're popping a balloon.

31:05.990 --> 31:07.490
You got it. Fast and deep.

31:12.290 --> 31:13.090
How was that?

31:13.340 --> 31:14.140
Awful.

31:14.840 --> 31:16.340
But I have, uh, some more saline solution,

31:16.340 --> 31:19.640
So, uh, you get two or three more shots at this.

31:21.740 --> 31:23.040
Justin, you're...

31:23.240 --> 31:25.440
the greatest brother in the world, blah, blah, blah.

31:25.740 --> 31:27.240
I just want to make you feel guilty for all the times

31:27.240 --> 31:28.940
you made me dress up in Mom's clothes.

31:28.940 --> 31:32.940
That wasn't me. That was Kitty. I just painted your toenails.

31:34.140 --> 31:35.240
OK, just...easy.

31:35.240 --> 31:36.340
Pop like a balloon.

31:41.440 --> 31:44.740
Jonathan, please, you have been on the cell phone all night.

31:44.740 --> 31:46.140
I'm trying to apologize.

31:46.140 --> 31:48.140
I'm trying to explain what happened tonight. I--

31:48.140 --> 31:49.740
Do you really want to talk about it?

31:50.040 --> 31:51.240
You want to talk about our double date

31:51.240 --> 31:52.740
with that jerk you slept with?

31:53.240 --> 31:54.340
You want to talk about taking me

31:54.340 --> 31:56.140
to the same restaurant you went to with him?

31:56.640 --> 31:58.240
I expected that passive-aggressive crap

31:58.240 --> 31:59.040
from your mother, Kitty.

31:59.040 --> 32:02.640
So, what's the deal? Is it genetic?
- I'm sorry. You're right.

32:02.640 --> 32:04.240
I've done everything I can possibly do

32:04.240 --> 32:06.540
to make this relationship work, and I keep waiting

32:06.540 --> 32:08.340
for some sort of good-faith effort from you,

32:08.740 --> 32:11.240
and what I get is a night like tonight.
- I'm so sorry.

32:11.240 --> 32:12.640
I'm trying the best I can --

32:12.640 --> 32:15.840
I don't--
- All this stuff: your job, living in two separate cities,

32:15.840 --> 32:17.940
Warren, your family; we could get past all of that.

32:17.940 --> 32:19.740
But I'm not sure any of that is the real problem.

32:23.040 --> 32:23.940
Maybe <i>we're</i> the problem.

32:28.440 --> 32:29.740
Look, I'm still on New York time.

32:31.440 --> 32:32.140
Let's get some sleep.

32:32.140 --> 32:33.240
We'll talk about it in the morning.

32:37.340 --> 32:39.340
I never know what to do after a date in L.A.

32:40.540 --> 32:41.940
People always just drive around,

32:42.040 --> 32:43.340
but that's what everyone does all day,

32:43.540 --> 32:44.740
and with the cost of gas...

32:45.540 --> 32:47.540
or you can go to an outdoor mall and walk around.

32:48.540 --> 32:49.940
I always feel like I'm in a theme park,

32:49.940 --> 32:52.640
and I get depressed I'm not in a real city like New York.

32:52.640 --> 32:54.740
Well, it's -- it's late, so I'll take you home.

32:56.340 --> 32:57.740
I don't know what happened in there,

32:58.340 --> 32:59.840
but it was just a kiss.

33:01.940 --> 33:03.440
I got a little anxious, that's all.

33:03.440 --> 33:04.440
And before you say anything,

33:04.440 --> 33:07.240
this has nothing to do with me being gay. I'm not--

33:07.240 --> 33:09.540
I'm not comfortable with public displays of affection.

33:09.540 --> 33:10.440
I wouldn't be if I was straight.

33:10.440 --> 33:13.140
Well, that's impossible to know, and I don't believe you anyway.

33:13.140 --> 33:14.740
Well, unfortunately, some of us were raised

33:14.740 --> 33:16.940
in a more reserved world, Scotty.
- You're not reserved.

33:17.240 --> 33:19.740
You're just tragically tangled up in your own homophobia.

33:20.340 --> 33:23.340
"Homophobia"? Wow. You-- you really don't know me.

33:23.540 --> 33:26.040
What's not to know? Your mother is a friend

33:26.140 --> 33:27.440
to lesbian and gay people everywhere.

33:27.440 --> 33:28.740
I know you're out at work.

33:28.740 --> 33:30.840
You probably go to benefits with lots of other gay men

33:30.840 --> 33:32.740
where you kiss each other on the cheeks,

33:32.740 --> 33:35.240
and I'm sure you get lots of phone numbers.

33:35.540 --> 33:36.140
But when you get home,

33:36.140 --> 33:37.840
more nights than not, you're alone...

33:38.540 --> 33:39.340
because the one place

33:39.340 --> 33:42.540
you don't feel comfortable and secure is in your own skin.

33:44.740 --> 33:46.440
I can read you like a comic book, Kevin Walker,

33:46.440 --> 33:50.140
two pages at a time.
- Can I tell you what your problem is now?

33:50.140 --> 33:50.940
Fire away.

33:50.940 --> 33:51.940
You're impatient.

33:52.540 --> 33:55.040
If you really did understand me, you'd know not to kiss me

33:55.040 --> 33:56.140
in the middle of an Indian restaurant

33:56.140 --> 33:57.940
while I'm still working on goat curry.

33:58.540 --> 34:01.040
All you had to do was wait until we got to the car.

34:01.740 --> 34:03.340
You should let people mature on their own terms.

34:03.340 --> 34:07.340
And no, you didn't just compare me to a comic book.
- But I love comic books.

34:10.940 --> 34:12.040
Come on, I'll drive you home.

34:18.040 --> 34:18.940
Hi.

34:19.739 --> 34:20.639
Can't sleep.

34:20.940 --> 34:21.840
Stupid wind.

34:22.639 --> 34:23.639
What are you watchin'?

34:25.340 --> 34:26.340
"Little Women."

34:27.139 --> 34:29.139
It's the original. It's almost over.

34:31.840 --> 34:33.940
I'm sorry I picked a fight

34:33.940 --> 34:35.440
with you earlier.

34:35.639 --> 34:37.239
I've forgotten about it already.

34:37.639 --> 34:41.639
The whole evening is a haze of alcohol and mortification.

34:42.940 --> 34:44.440
Do you remember that speech you made

34:44.440 --> 34:47.239
about how you hate all my boyfriends?

34:47.639 --> 34:50.639
Yes, only because I practice it so often.

34:51.440 --> 34:53.239
Well, I need your help, Mom.

34:54.639 --> 34:55.739
I, um...

34:57.940 --> 34:59.640
I don't konw what to do about Jonathan.

35:00.040 --> 35:02.440
What if he's another guy that I picked

35:02.440 --> 35:03.840
because he looks good on paper,

35:04.240 --> 35:06.840
or <i>we</i> look good on paper?

35:08.140 --> 35:10.340
To be fair, he looks pretty good in a towel, too.

35:11.240 --> 35:13.240
Do you really think that I don't love him?

35:15.740 --> 35:19.640
Kitty, I think you love Jonathan the most

35:19.640 --> 35:20.940
when he's about to leave.

35:22.440 --> 35:23.240
Mmm.

35:23.240 --> 35:24.340
Tell him the truth, Kitty.

35:25.540 --> 35:27.640
It's the best advice a mother can ever give,

35:27.640 --> 35:29.340
'cause it's always right.

35:31.640 --> 35:32.840
Do you know what the truth is?

35:35.440 --> 35:36.240
No.

35:36.340 --> 35:37.640
Well, I can't help you there.

35:39.640 --> 35:40.240
Thanks.

35:40.240 --> 35:41.440
OK.

35:46.540 --> 35:48.440
When did you see Jonathan in a towel?

35:49.440 --> 35:51.140
I opened the door without knocking once.

36:03.440 --> 36:05.940
You've gotta stop thinking of Ojai as a fruit company.

36:06.340 --> 36:09.140
The orchards, the processing plant, the canneries--

36:09.940 --> 36:11.540
the margins on all of these are too low.

36:12.140 --> 36:13.840
The gold mine is your distribution.

36:13.840 --> 36:16.040
Why? Because even though it's 15% of your business,

36:16.340 --> 36:18.240
it's the 15% you're great at.

36:18.240 --> 36:19.040
You seel the orchards.

36:19.040 --> 36:20.640
You make it contractural in the sale

36:21.040 --> 36:23.140
that they use Ojai as their distributor.

36:23.140 --> 36:25.240
I had my boys in New York work up a spreadsheet

36:25.240 --> 36:27.640
for projected growth. Take a look. See what you think.

36:27.640 --> 36:30.040
So, Sarah, tell me, are you on board with this?

36:30.240 --> 36:32.740
Jonathan went through things on the phone with me last night.

36:32.740 --> 36:36.340
I can't argue any of it. It's kind of brilliant

36:36.340 --> 36:39.540
in its simplicity.
- Well, I'm sorry to reorganize and run.

36:39.840 --> 36:41.040
Got some business myself.

36:41.040 --> 36:42.740
Jonathan, I can't tell you how lucky we feel

36:42.740 --> 36:45.640
to have you helping us with this. 
- It's been a pleasure.

36:45.640 --> 36:48.140
Thank you, Jon-- Oh, come here. Thank you.

36:50.340 --> 36:52.540
I've never been crazy about any of Kitty's boyfriends,

36:52.540 --> 36:53.940
but you I love.

36:53.940 --> 36:54.740
I'll be right back.

36:59.440 --> 37:00.140
You were right.

37:01.040 --> 37:02.240
I was afraid to make a decision.

37:04.740 --> 37:06.340
This is gonna cause a lot of pain,

37:06.940 --> 37:08.140
and I just wasn't up for it.

37:08.540 --> 37:11.340
Seems to be a re-ocurring issue with me at the moment.

37:11.640 --> 37:12.540
We all have issues.

37:13.840 --> 37:15.540
For instance, I have a hard time accepting

37:15.540 --> 37:16.540
how handsome I am.

37:18.240 --> 37:20.440
You have an issue with your little brother.

37:20.840 --> 37:22.440
That's between me and Justin.

37:22.440 --> 37:24.540
He really needs you, Tommy.
- Sarah, don't--

37:24.540 --> 37:25.940
OK.
- Not today.

37:26.040 --> 37:26.840
OK.

37:27.640 --> 37:28.840
So, um...

37:29.740 --> 37:30.940
We have to tell the employees.

37:31.440 --> 37:33.240
I'll take care of them.
- Thank you.

37:33.240 --> 37:34.140
You gotta tell Mom.

37:36.040 --> 37:37.240
How am I gonna do that?

37:47.440 --> 37:48.440
Hi.

37:48.640 --> 37:49.540
I...

37:50.240 --> 37:51.840
I wanted to apologize for last night.

37:52.540 --> 37:53.640
Why-- why didn't you just call?

37:54.040 --> 37:56.140
I felt like I should...say this in person.

37:56.940 --> 37:59.540
I assumed things about you I had no right to.

37:59.550 --> 38:04.840
I mean, I'm judging you for air-kissing people at benefits I don't even get invited to. Frankly, I couldn't afford them.

38:05.440 --> 38:07.940
What I really want to say is, I like you,

38:08.940 --> 38:12.040
and I feel completely and totally out of my league.

38:12.040 --> 38:14.640
Frankly, I feel like such a loser when I'm with you.

38:16.640 --> 38:17.540
Well, that's a whole other conversation.

38:17.940 --> 38:18.840
That's my homework.

38:18.840 --> 38:21.740
Scotty...stop talking.

38:24.040 --> 38:26.140
You were right about everything.

38:26.440 --> 38:30.240
And frankly, I'm relieved you're not as wildly evolved

38:30.240 --> 38:30.940
as you seem.

38:30.940 --> 38:33.640
It can be very...intimidating.

38:36.840 --> 38:38.540
We're doing that "not look away" thing again

38:38.740 --> 38:39.540
you like so much.

38:54.640 --> 38:55.440
Hi, Mrs. Berrymen.

38:59.340 --> 39:00.340
OK, thanks.

39:03.440 --> 39:04.540
I'm kidding. Get in here.

39:10.940 --> 39:11.740
Hey.

39:11.740 --> 39:12.440
How was your meeting?

39:13.140 --> 39:13.940
It ran a little long.

39:14.740 --> 39:16.040
Who was it with again?

39:16.440 --> 39:17.440
Just some old friends.

39:17.740 --> 39:20.740
They have a company that needs some help.

39:21.340 --> 39:23.040
And did you help them?

39:23.340 --> 39:24.340
I don't know.

39:24.640 --> 39:26.740
Sometimes I have to remember

39:26.740 --> 39:28.840
that not all businesses want to be saved

39:30.040 --> 39:32.240
and the hardest thing is knowing when to give up.

39:34.240 --> 39:35.540
That's what you want, isn't it?

39:39.640 --> 39:40.640
Now I know.

39:41.640 --> 39:43.240
I don't want to be with you, Jonathan,

39:43.240 --> 39:44.940
just because I don't want to be alone.

39:45.740 --> 39:49.540
We go out for dinner, and-- and we talk about politics

39:49.540 --> 39:50.840
and we talk about business,

39:50.840 --> 39:51.840
and it works.

39:54.740 --> 39:56.440
But it's like the difference between looking good

39:56.440 --> 39:57.640
and feeling good.

40:00.240 --> 40:01.740
That's funny, because all this time,

40:01.740 --> 40:03.040
that's what I've been trying to do:

40:03.940 --> 40:05.240
is make you feel good.

40:06.540 --> 40:07.640
It's not your fault.

40:10.240 --> 40:12.240
I just have to figure out how to be on my own.

40:12.940 --> 40:14.040
I don't think you'll have any trouble

40:14.040 --> 40:14.940
being alone, Kitty.

40:16.640 --> 40:20.640
What you need to figure out is how to let somebody in.

40:23.140 --> 40:24.640
I should pack.

40:37.940 --> 40:38.540
Hey, Mom.

40:38.540 --> 40:39.440
Hey.

40:40.440 --> 40:41.440
I saw the light on.

40:42.840 --> 40:43.540
You scared again?

40:44.840 --> 40:46.940
No. No, I'm not scared.

40:47.340 --> 40:48.440
Well, this book would scare you.

40:49.240 --> 40:52.140
The things this government does in the name of democracy.

40:52.440 --> 40:53.340
Mom...

40:55.040 --> 40:55.940
Not now.

40:57.740 --> 40:58.740
Oh.

41:01.440 --> 41:02.340
Jonathan?

41:02.940 --> 41:04.940
Mm-hmm.

41:05.240 --> 41:06.140
He's gone.

41:10.440 --> 41:11.340
You know what?

41:11.740 --> 41:14.240
Sometimes the fairy tales I read to you

41:14.240 --> 41:15.040
when you were a kid,

41:15.040 --> 41:18.639
it was so hard because I knew they were not true.

41:18.640 --> 41:21.640
Mom, you never read us fairy tales.

41:21.640 --> 41:24.240
You read us op-ed pieces from the "Times."

41:24.940 --> 41:26.340
I-I read you--

41:26.340 --> 41:28.240
Oh, you kids never remember anything right.

41:30.640 --> 41:31.740
Oh.

41:32.640 --> 41:34.340
Mm. Never gonna get used to that.

41:36.440 --> 41:37.440
You want to stay here tonight?

41:38.040 --> 41:38.840
Can I?

41:39.140 --> 41:41.740
Of course you can. Come on.

41:45.440 --> 41:46.440
OK.

41:47.840 --> 41:50.140
Ooh. Come here.

41:50.940 --> 41:52.040
There you are.

41:56.540 --> 41:57.740
Close your eyes.

42:00.140 --> 42:01.640
Oh, listen to the wind.

42:04.840 --> 42:06.140
It's just the wind.

42:06.140 --> 42:08.049
