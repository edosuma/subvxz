00:32.592 --> 00:34.751
Anybody watching needs to know,

00:34.752 --> 00:37.551
we cope better than average
with irony in Chatsworth.

00:37.552 --> 00:40.551
Well, for fucks sake,
we live in Manchester

00:40.552 --> 00:43.631
and they charge us for water.

00:43.632 --> 00:49.191
I wandered lonely as a clown,
necking mushrooms rarely found.

yak, yak! It's not theirs any more.

This is our England now!

Paaaarty!

this lad in my teens.

I changed it by deed poll,

have an opinion, you're up in arms!

06:51.032 --> 06:52.631
Dad, shut the fuck up!

06:52.632 --> 06:56.751
No. You can't have a balanced
discussion, can't dare to disagree.

06:56.752 --> 07:01.231
Oh, sorry, but the vast majority
of folk in the free world

07:01.232 --> 07:03.911
don't share your point of
view vis a vis your God

07:03.912 --> 07:06.871
and the way his representatives on
Earth are conducting themselves.

07:06.872 --> 07:09.111
You're welcome to
your opinion, Frank.

07:09.112 --> 07:10.070
Oh, cheers.

07:10.071 --> 07:11.030
I just don't want to hear it.

07:11.031 --> 07:13.470
And don't we know it. Someone
dares speak out of turn

07:13.471 --> 07:15.272
and you're down on them
like a ton of bricks,

07:15.273 --> 07:17.311
literally,
in some parts of the world.

07:17.312 --> 07:18.792
That's bang out of order.

07:18.793 --> 07:22.351
No. Karen. Blowing yourself up and
taking folk with you

07:22.352 --> 07:24.391
who don't wanna go,
is bang out of order!

07:24.392 --> 07:26.431
You need to watch
what you're saying.

07:26.432 --> 07:30.832
Or what? You're going to get a Fatwa
on me, yeah? Frankie gets a Fatwa?

07:38.032 --> 07:40.312
I'm not saying one religion
is any better than the other.

07:40.313 --> 07:42.152
They're all shite.

07:43.632 --> 07:47.711
It's just a way of administering
control, pulling strings.

07:47.712 --> 07:50.471
God's just a bogeyman!

07:50.472 --> 07:51.752
That is so offensive.

07:51.753 --> 07:54.191
Well, I'd rate buggering choirboys

07:54.192 --> 07:57.431
and abusing kids in care more
offensive, Mimi, but, hey, you know,

07:57.432 --> 08:00.911
one man's Sistine Chapel ceiling
is another man's floor, I suppose.

08:00.912 --> 08:03.951
So all Catholics bugger
choirboys, do they?

08:03.952 --> 08:08.832
Can't say I have. Shane?

what it meant.

of work you're not!

08:31.752 --> 08:32.792
You're a whore.

08:32.793 --> 08:35.231
A little Old Testament
for my tastes, but yep.

08:35.232 --> 08:38.711
I thought you were
here to get everyone happy clappy,

08:38.712 --> 08:41.032
not interfere with the way I earn
my living, or give an opinion on it.

08:41.033 --> 08:44.871
Let's pray, Kelly.
Join me. Be forgiven.

08:44.872 --> 08:49.031
I'll be on me knees as
soon as I clock on for work

08:49.032 --> 08:51.951
and you'll be flat on your back
if you don't call your bitches off.

08:51.952 --> 08:55.191
I don't want
or need your forgiveness.

08:55.192 --> 08:58.391
It's the Almighty
you're asking to forgive.

08:58.392 --> 09:01.591
And be honest, you could do with
a little guidance in your life.

09:01.592 --> 09:03.671
No!

09:07.392 --> 09:11.911

have avoided a lot of heartache.

How the fuck do you...?

09:13.832 --> 09:16.352
Move!

09:18.312 --> 09:21.032

more where that came from, too!

09:41.393 --> 09:44.031

somewhere else!

See right into our souls.

10:46.073 --> 10:49.151
Trickery, Kelly. Smoke and mirrors,

10:49.152 --> 10:51.471
Except yours, obviously.

as previously mentioned.

Hang on, got to admit it's been
a bit nicer since they arrived.

11:03.992 --> 11:05.792
Let me give you a hand.

11:10.392 --> 11:12.352
Kids off the street are socialising

11:12.353 --> 11:15.071
instead of making nuisances
of themselves.

11:28.472 --> 11:29.951
Well done!

11:29.952 --> 11:31.951
Apart from picketing my business

11:31.952 --> 11:34.711
and threatening to expose
my clientele, you mean?

11:34.712 --> 11:37.271
Let them fill their boots
and move on.

11:37.272 --> 11:41.031

And when they find out what
you're doing to one of their own...

12:13.032 --> 12:14.992
At least I got the right one.

12:22.992 --> 12:24.591

12:26.672 --> 12:28.992

12:32.352 --> 12:34.911
We were in Spain, paradise.

12:34.912 --> 12:37.031
Happiest ever.

12:37.032 --> 12:38.391
We had each other.

12:38.392 --> 12:39.352
The kids.

12:40.592 --> 12:41.752
So what happened?

12:41.753 --> 12:45.391
I couldn't give her what she wanted.
I tried.

12:45.392 --> 12:47.391
Had this job in Fuengirola.

12:47.392 --> 12:49.951
We were just scraping by,
but we were together.

12:49.952 --> 12:51.912
Anyway, before long...

12:53.312 --> 12:56.551
She found someone who could give her
what she wanted.

12:56.552 --> 12:58.671
She left you.

12:58.672 --> 13:00.231
Took my kids.

13:00.232 --> 13:04.032
Arsin-arsin-arsin' around behind
my back with some greasy wop!

13:04.992 --> 13:06.471
Wops are Italian.

13:06.472 --> 13:07.831
You were in Spain.

13:07.832 --> 13:12.352
They're all the same gel-wearing
tight trousered bastards.
Put the fire out! She...

13:14.032 --> 13:17.392
She put out the fire - desire -
that I felt for her.

13:18.912 --> 13:20.792
So you're back here.

13:27.912 --> 13:30.471
Fuck, sorry.

13:30.472 --> 13:33.072
Who is it?

13:34.472 --> 13:35.671
Mum.

13:35.672 --> 13:37.632
It's Carol?

13:39.632 --> 13:41.592
I had no idea she'd...

13:45.912 --> 13:49.792
You have had a shit time of it,
haven't you?

13:51.472 --> 13:54.031
Look, you can't stay here.

13:54.032 --> 13:55.591
I'll have a word with Shane.

13:55.592 --> 14:00.591
It'll only be the couch,
but at least you'll be warm. Safe.

14:00.592 --> 14:02.552
How about it, eh?

14:05.512 --> 14:07.352
Yeah.

14:11.832 --> 14:14.111
Does it look like I go
to prayer meetings?

14:14.112 --> 14:18.031

14:20.513 --> 14:24.152
Call him Meff for short.

14:25.432 --> 14:28.191
I've been sent by God to save you.

14:28.192 --> 14:29.511
Many women bigger, wiser

14:29.512 --> 14:32.311
and on the legal side of puberty

Me and my benefits
are classified information.

not only against your fellow man,

19:56.032 --> 19:58.031
I didn't pay maintenance.

19:58.032 --> 20:01.951
I didn't have it. When she kicked
me out, I slept on the beach.

20:01.952 --> 20:04.471

20:27.432 --> 20:30.751

the best thing we could do

26:13.952 --> 26:15.071
Yep.

26:15.072 --> 26:15.712
It'll just be a funny patch.

26:15.713 --> 26:16.632

26:18.952 --> 26:20.752

26:22.512 --> 26:25.831
Patty's made a threat which Mam
thinks we need to take seriously.

26:25.832 --> 26:28.631
So there's a family pow wow
later to decide the next move.

26:28.632 --> 26:31.551
Hiya. What you been up to?

26:31.552 --> 26:35.792
Not much. Someone nearly got
their arse kicked, that's all. You?

26:37.552 --> 26:39.031
Been with a client.

26:39.032 --> 26:40.791

26:41.832 --> 26:43.072
You've give it a name?

26:43.073 --> 26:45.951
No, Micky. Everyone calls it basil.

26:45.952 --> 26:47.191
What's it for?

26:47.192 --> 26:50.511
Cooking. Stick it in a pasta,
top of pizzas.

26:50.512 --> 26:51.910
We're having pasta again?

26:51.911 --> 26:53.312
No, we're not having pasta.

26:53.313 --> 26:55.151
What the fuck you buy it for then?

26:55.152 --> 26:55.992
It's a gift.

26:55.993 --> 26:57.511

26:57.512 --> 26:59.591
as a thank you
for paying to fuck you?

26:59.592 --> 27:02.872
It wasn't a perv.
It was Marty.

27:13.912 --> 27:15.392
So he's buying you a plant?

27:15.393 --> 27:17.991
Shane! Punter have bought me
watches before now.

27:17.992 --> 27:21.511
Red roses marking the anniversary
of when they first fucked me

27:21.512 --> 27:24.671
and you and me, we laughed at that.

27:24.672 --> 27:26.031
Why's it bothering you?

27:26.032 --> 27:28.511
You do not buy a plant.

27:28.512 --> 27:31.831
We were just having a laugh. We just
got talking about stuff we liked...

27:31.832 --> 27:33.192
Shane!

27:35.192 --> 27:38.351
Shane, come on! This is stupid!

27:38.352 --> 27:39.592
Shane, will you...

27:39.593 --> 27:40.791
Fuck off.

27:40.792 --> 27:43.351
It's a plant. A fucking plant.

27:43.352 --> 27:46.152
It was a joke, a thank you,
that's all.

27:50.872 --> 27:52.191
Shane!

27:52.192 --> 27:54.432
Stop it! Shane!

27:57.112 --> 27:58.392
Shane, stop it.

27:58.393 --> 27:59.631
Shane?

27:59.632 --> 28:02.671
Stop it now. No! No!

28:02.672 --> 28:05.911
Shane! Leave it. Leave it.

28:05.912 --> 28:08.511
Fuck off. It's none of
your business. Fucking do one!

28:08.512 --> 28:10.151
Are you OK, love?

28:10.152 --> 28:11.191
Just leave.

28:11.192 --> 28:12.751
(GRUNTS)

28:12.752 --> 28:15.431
What the fuck are you doing?!

28:15.432 --> 28:18.191
Fuck's this about?!

28:18.192 --> 28:19.751
There's no need,

28:19.752 --> 28:22.031
absolutely no need!

28:22.032 --> 28:24.191
He stays away.

28:24.192 --> 28:26.111
You don't say who can and can't...

28:26.112 --> 28:28.951
You are my wife!

28:28.952 --> 28:31.311
Kelly Maguire.

28:31.312 --> 28:33.311
You got that?

28:33.312 --> 28:33.952
Maguire.

28:33.953 --> 28:35.712
And don't I fucking know it!

28:37.192 --> 28:39.632
Come on. I said come on.

28:42.232 --> 28:43.831
(CRIES)

28:43.832 --> 28:46.272
(MOANS)

28:49.112 --> 28:51.311
What's it like living round here?

28:51.312 --> 28:52.911
Better than where I used to live.

28:52.912 --> 28:55.191
We shouldn't even be
talking to each other.

28:55.192 --> 28:57.871
Being on opposing sides, you mean?

28:57.872 --> 29:00.991
The Maguires have asked me to find
out what your lot are planning.

29:00.992 --> 29:04.871
And I've been asked to find out
what the Maguires are planning.

29:04.872 --> 29:06.151
Fuck 'em.

29:06.152 --> 29:08.151
Fuck 'em all.

29:08.152 --> 29:09.791
I'll pray for your soul.

29:09.792 --> 29:11.711
Don't you ever get pissed off?

29:11.712 --> 29:14.591
I mean, um, bored,
doing this all the time?

29:14.592 --> 29:18.791
If I can get through to one person,
just one, it'll have been worthwhile.

29:18.792 --> 29:20.312
PHONE RINGS

29:23.792 --> 29:25.751
Yes, mate.

29:25.752 --> 29:28.071
Never just want a bit of fun?

29:28.072 --> 29:29.511
I do have fun.

29:29.512 --> 29:33.191
I enjoy my work, my mission.

29:33.192 --> 29:36.031
Look, I believe in God but
only for an hour on a Sunday.

29:36.032 --> 29:38.191
It hasn't taken over my whole life.

29:38.192 --> 29:39.272
It needs to.

29:40.512 --> 29:43.072
Don't you just want
a bit of excitement?

29:44.872 --> 29:46.551
BANG

29:46.552 --> 29:48.192
ALARM RINGS

30:03.912 --> 30:04.992
Fuck.

30:07.112 --> 30:09.231
These fuckers are harder
than we thought.

30:09.232 --> 30:11.751
Willing to go to any lengths
to prove their point.

30:11.752 --> 30:13.552
It might not have been them.

30:14.792 --> 30:16.272
Who else could it have been?

30:16.273 --> 30:20.271
I told Patty the score,
she threw down the gauntlet.

30:20.272 --> 30:22.151
This is war.

30:22.152 --> 30:25.511
So much for peace and goodwill, eh?

30:25.512 --> 30:29.951
Me and my Brendan was involved
in an explosion once. 1972.

30:29.952 --> 30:33.031
We were on a cruise,
celebrating us anniversary.

30:33.032 --> 30:35.471
Having dinner
at the Captains' table,

30:35.472 --> 30:37.831
when suddenly,
this God almighty bang...

30:37.832 --> 30:41.191
and the ship tipped.
Felt it... wham.

30:41.192 --> 30:44.511
And within an hour,
the whole vessel were upside down.

30:44.512 --> 30:45.512
We were trapped.

30:49.232 --> 30:52.351
That was the Poseidon Adventure.

30:52.352 --> 30:53.792
Did it not happen?

30:55.032 --> 30:58.871
So we're just going to sit here,
let 'em get away with it?

30:58.872 --> 31:02.031
Would you be doing this if I'd have
been blown to fuckin' pieces?

31:02.032 --> 31:03.631
No.

31:03.632 --> 31:05.231
So what do we do?

31:05.232 --> 31:06.831
Go round there and we nail them.

31:06.832 --> 31:09.711
What? You mean kill them?
Kill Jesus?

31:09.712 --> 31:10.512
Kill 'em all.

31:10.513 --> 31:12.271
We tried the gentle approach,

31:12.272 --> 31:14.191
and they wouldn't listen.

31:14.192 --> 31:16.911
Your answer to everything that,
isn't it?

31:16.912 --> 31:17.792
What do you suggest?

31:17.793 --> 31:20.831
I dunno. Anything but that.

31:20.832 --> 31:21.752
It's just wrong.

31:21.753 --> 31:23.391
It's all wrong.

31:23.392 --> 31:27.152
This time tomorrow, our problem
will no longer be our problem.

31:37.072 --> 31:40.631
Kel, Kel! Are you OK?
He didn't hit you?

31:40.632 --> 31:42.871
He wouldn't fucking dare.

31:42.872 --> 31:45.712
Don't come round again, Marty.

31:49.272 --> 31:50.352
Why?

31:51.552 --> 31:52.752
He'll kill you.

31:52.753 --> 31:54.431
I can't just stop seeing you.

31:54.432 --> 31:54.950
You're going to have to.

31:54.951 --> 31:55.752
I can't!

31:55.753 --> 31:57.591
Why the fuck not?

31:57.592 --> 31:58.632
Because I love ya.

32:06.392 --> 32:07.632
I love ya!

32:15.312 --> 32:16.711
You sure you're OK?

32:16.712 --> 32:18.711
Fine, thanks, Auntie.

32:18.712 --> 32:21.111
If you're agreeable,
you could stay with us.

32:21.112 --> 32:25.511
Come with us. Join our Crusade.

32:25.512 --> 32:26.712
You mean it?

32:28.032 --> 32:30.272
Indeed we do.

32:33.392 --> 32:34.431
Where's Grace?

32:34.432 --> 32:37.551
Upstairs, having a lie down.

32:37.552 --> 32:41.191
I'm off on a few messages.

32:41.192 --> 32:44.311
If you need anything,
just call for Jesus.

32:44.312 --> 32:46.112
I'll be in the office.

32:48.792 --> 32:52.592
THUNDER

33:06.752 --> 33:08.391
What you doing?

33:08.392 --> 33:10.072
What's it look like?

33:30.752 --> 33:32.432
It's upside down.

33:35.472 --> 33:37.632
Hey. Jesus?

33:56.672 --> 33:59.071
If you hadn't dragged
my husband off,

33:59.072 --> 34:02.191
he'd have killed that poor bastard
and be looking at a life stretch.

34:02.192 --> 34:03.951
So I owe you.

34:03.952 --> 34:05.032
My lot have had enough

34:05.033 --> 34:07.991
and they plan to make sure
you don't cause no more problems.

34:07.992 --> 34:10.271
When they realise
we pose no threat...

34:10.272 --> 34:11.630
Look, Jesus...

34:11.632 --> 34:14.311
What's your real name?
I can't keep calling you that.

34:14.312 --> 34:16.471
That is my real name.

34:16.472 --> 34:17.992
What did your mam call you?

34:19.312 --> 34:22.992
Fuck's sake, I'm trying
to have a serious conversation.

34:27.712 --> 34:28.751
Eric.

34:28.752 --> 34:30.431
Eric.

34:31.792 --> 34:33.190
Eric.

34:33.192 --> 34:38.670
Some folk respond well
to kindness, a soft touch.

34:38.672 --> 34:40.752
Jamie isn't the type of man
you want to be messing with.

34:40.753 --> 34:43.150
When the Romans came for Christ...

34:43.152 --> 34:45.232
You want to finish up
in the foundations for a flyover...

34:45.233 --> 34:46.592
Sit tight.

34:51.272 --> 34:53.630
There's something
I don't understand.

34:53.632 --> 34:55.192
You're a...

34:57.192 --> 34:58.232
good looking bloke.

34:58.233 --> 35:02.111
Kind, considerate, passionate.

35:02.112 --> 35:05.111
Your love for God
tells me that much.

35:05.112 --> 35:06.350
You never been tempted?

35:06.351 --> 35:07.552
You never been tempted?

35:07.553 --> 35:09.871
I pray to God to keep me pure.

35:09.872 --> 35:11.951
You never longed for that touch?

35:11.952 --> 35:13.152
That euphoria.

35:14.712 --> 35:16.391
Him.

35:16.392 --> 35:17.272
His need.

35:17.273 --> 35:18.632
My need.

35:20.872 --> 35:22.192
When we make love...

35:23.752 --> 35:26.391
I could almost believe in God.

35:26.392 --> 35:27.911
It's that good.

35:27.912 --> 35:29.192
It's that good.

35:32.592 --> 35:33.671
Don't be here.

35:33.672 --> 35:35.712
They're coming.

35:39.712 --> 35:40.991
See ya.

35:40.992 --> 35:42.232
Bye.

35:44.272 --> 35:46.072
Nice shoes, Grace.

35:50.072 --> 35:51.592
You'd better go.

36:27.832 --> 36:29.391
Arghh! What?!

36:29.392 --> 36:31.431
Have you heard from Libby?

36:31.432 --> 36:33.471
I'm the last one she'd
get in touch with!

36:33.472 --> 36:34.312
Where is she?

36:34.313 --> 36:35.752
I don't know!

36:39.312 --> 36:42.112
Why are you so intent
on seeing her anyway?

36:44.192 --> 36:46.150
She didn't say
where she was going,

36:46.151 --> 36:47.272
or who she was going with?

36:47.273 --> 36:49.711
Why would she tell me?

36:49.712 --> 36:52.271
She didn't leave a note for me?

36:52.272 --> 36:53.871
What, for her jailer?

36:53.872 --> 36:55.591
Her tormentor?

36:55.592 --> 36:56.991
I'm her mother.

36:56.992 --> 36:59.071
Just because you've seen the light,

36:59.072 --> 37:01.552
doesn't mean to say
everyone else has too.

37:13.552 --> 37:15.991
Go seek comfort in Jesus.

37:15.992 --> 37:17.711
Not the real one, obviously.

37:17.712 --> 37:19.951
I'm not suggesting you should
top yourself,

37:19.952 --> 37:22.712
but, you know, the himbo on the bus.

37:24.112 --> 37:29.071
I'm sure he can rustle up
a few words of comfort

37:29.072 --> 37:30.671
from some Epistle or another.

37:30.672 --> 37:32.712
You know, rattle his tambourine.

37:41.672 --> 37:43.071
Fuck me.

37:43.072 --> 37:45.632
The ice maiden melteth.

38:13.152 --> 38:15.071
I shed a few tears for her.

38:15.072 --> 38:16.352
Mostly of regret.

38:16.353 --> 38:19.191
You treated her like shite.

38:19.192 --> 38:21.471
Regret that I ever met her,

38:21.472 --> 38:24.391
that we ever picked up where
we left off,

38:24.392 --> 38:27.671
cos truth be told, there was nothing
left to pick up.

38:27.672 --> 38:30.471
But, I got me tea made.
Me washing done...

38:30.472 --> 38:32.111
A good nosh now and again.

38:32.112 --> 38:33.992
You bastard!

38:35.112 --> 38:39.151
All she needed to hear was, "I love
you", and she was on her knees.

38:39.152 --> 38:41.672
I've had better sex but my
shirts have never been whiter.

38:45.112 --> 38:49.351
I wondered when the real Patty
would resurface.

38:49.352 --> 38:51.232
And here she is.

38:59.552 --> 39:01.952
So, this is goodbye then, is it?

39:04.712 --> 39:06.671
I can't see any reason to stay.

39:06.672 --> 39:08.592
Where did you go when you left here?

39:08.593 --> 39:11.271
What turned you from the godless
old crone we knew

39:11.272 --> 39:14.511
into the God-fearing crone
now before us?

39:14.512 --> 39:17.471
Much like yourself,
I lived a selfish life,

39:17.472 --> 39:22.151
attending to my needs before even
considering the needs of others.

39:22.152 --> 39:25.871
And then I went back to Ireland
and, while there,

39:25.872 --> 39:31.511
had what I can only describe
as my Road To Damascus experience.

39:31.512 --> 39:35.071
Oh, so God just popped up and
showed you the error of your ways?

39:35.072 --> 39:37.111
Yeah? Well, I don't believe a word.

39:37.112 --> 39:40.391
I think little Patty clocked
the Jesus freaks and thought,

39:40.392 --> 39:44.311
"Bingo! Free meals and a roof over
me head for the rest of me life."

39:44.312 --> 39:46.751
I wouldn't expect you to believe.

39:46.752 --> 39:50.311
I was a lost sheep and God saved me.

39:50.312 --> 39:51.871
Liar.

39:51.872 --> 39:55.631
May He strike me down here and now

39:55.632 --> 39:58.112
if I tell a word of a lie.

40:53.792 --> 40:55.271
Matty?

40:55.272 --> 40:56.351
I'm going.

40:56.352 --> 40:57.391
Good.

40:57.392 --> 40:59.311
No. I mean, I'm leaving this.

40:59.312 --> 41:01.871
You don't have to leave this.
Just here.

41:01.872 --> 41:04.511
My head's full of everything
I've been missing.

41:04.512 --> 41:07.351
You can have it all, you know.
I think God would let you.

41:07.352 --> 41:10.791
How can I preach purity
when all I want to be is impure?

41:10.792 --> 41:14.671
Preach goodness,
when all I want to do is bad?

41:14.672 --> 41:17.472
I'm not worthy.
They deserve better than me.

41:20.352 --> 41:23.191
What you want to do, it's normal.

41:23.192 --> 41:24.551
It's not bad.

41:24.552 --> 41:26.551
But I want it to be bad.

41:26.552 --> 41:29.152
I want to bite the apple, Kelly.

41:35.432 --> 41:37.032
Thank you.

42:14.552 --> 42:15.831
Anyone?

42:15.832 --> 42:17.272
Nothing.

42:33.552 --> 42:35.911
See you got my present, then?

42:35.912 --> 42:37.032
I won't ask where it came from.

42:37.033 --> 42:38.231
'No, don't.'

42:38.232 --> 42:39.312
You got my present?

42:39.313 --> 42:41.991
I got it.

42:41.992 --> 42:46.751
Listen, next time you're saving
souls round here, come save mine.

42:46.752 --> 42:48.672
Bye.

42:52.432 --> 42:55.831
They say the damage to my spine
is irreparable.

42:55.832 --> 42:57.231
I'll never walk again.

42:57.232 --> 42:59.791
You've taken it very well,
I'll give you that.

42:59.792 --> 43:01.351
I've got my life back, Frank.

43:01.352 --> 43:02.831
What could be better?

43:02.832 --> 43:04.511
I don't understand.

43:04.512 --> 43:06.591
The police will be here any minute.

43:06.592 --> 43:10.231
And what I tell them
depends very much on you.

43:10.232 --> 43:12.351
How do you mean?

43:12.352 --> 43:15.671
Everyone on the estate
knows how much you hated me.

43:15.672 --> 43:18.752
Everyone knows how much you
wanted me out the picture.

43:20.192 --> 43:23.551
If you agree to have me move back,

43:23.552 --> 43:25.911
then I agree not to tell the police

43:25.912 --> 43:28.911
you pushed me down the stairs -
that you did this.

43:28.912 --> 43:31.791
Well, that's just gonna be my word
against... Who's gonna believe..?

43:31.792 --> 43:33.831
Ah! Oh, nurse!

43:33.832 --> 43:35.271
Oh! Nurse!

43:35.272 --> 43:36.791
Pain, oh!

43:36.792 --> 43:38.271
Oh!

43:38.272 --> 43:40.232
We'll have to increase
your morphine.

43:40.233 --> 43:43.271
I'm just going to check with
the doctor. Hang on there, Patty.

43:43.272 --> 43:44.632
Oh! Oh!

43:50.592 --> 43:53.511
Wouldn't you be better off
back on the bus,

43:53.512 --> 43:55.631
amongst your own kind?

43:55.632 --> 43:59.631
With those Bible bashing bastards?
I can't stand the feckin' sight
of them!

43:59.632 --> 44:01.551
I want to be amongst folk I know.

44:01.552 --> 44:04.311
Familiar faces, surroundings.

44:04.312 --> 44:05.991
I want to come home.

44:05.992 --> 44:10.272
And I wanted to make your life
a feckin' misery, Frank.

44:24.712 --> 44:28.271
'I ran into that old boyfriend
a few years ago.

44:28.272 --> 44:30.031
'I was out with the girls in town,

44:30.032 --> 44:32.631
'turned a corner and bang,
there he was.

44:32.632 --> 44:36.231
'No longer a possible
replacement for Robbie or Gary.

44:36.232 --> 44:38.712
'His face was etched with all
the wrong he'd done.

44:38.713 --> 44:40.271
'All the pain he'd caused.'

44:40.272 --> 44:41.272
Oh, they're here!

44:41.273 --> 44:43.351
'And, if I believed in God,

44:43.352 --> 44:47.591
'I'd like to think he'd had every
sin that he'd ever committed

44:47.592 --> 44:51.551
'scratched into his face
as a warning to others

44:51.552 --> 44:53.832
'to keep their distance - to beware.

44:59.072 --> 45:00.552
'That's if I believed in God.'

45:01.672 --> 45:04.431
What are you going on about?
It's a scratch card!

45:04.432 --> 45:07.431
(REPORTER)
Tonight, a pensioner was brutally assaulted

45:07.432 --> 45:09.191
in her home in Belvedere Road...

45:09.192 --> 45:13.671
If it gets any clearer,
I'll be topping meself.

45:13.672 --> 45:15.112
It's Frank's name on the line.

45:15.113 --> 45:16.632
Yeah, and his head.

45:18.312 --> 45:20.311
Don't know how you missed him!

45:20.312 --> 45:21.391
What the fuck?

45:21.392 --> 45:24.191
Forensics rustled a few new words
up for you, Frank.

45:24.192 --> 45:25.191
DNA.

45:25.192 --> 45:26.631
Positive match.

45:26.632 --> 45:29.551
If it was you, that'd be
us finished.

45:29.552 --> 45:30.672
I need Kev! Where is he?
