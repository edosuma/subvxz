WEBVTT

00:01.218 --> 00:02.654
- Men and women
of Stowe...

00:04.569 --> 00:05.875
- Old friends...

00:05.918 --> 00:07.964
- I'm so excited!

00:08.008 --> 00:09.052
- New friends...

00:09.096 --> 00:11.228
- Why are my panties
on the ground?

00:11.272 --> 00:14.666
- And dingleberries...

00:14.710 --> 00:16.494
we came here to party.

00:16.538 --> 00:17.756
- What's up?

00:17.800 --> 00:19.845
- Are you ----ing kidding?

00:19.889 --> 00:21.325
- Bikini down!

00:21.369 --> 00:23.023
- This season,
on "Winter House"...

00:23.066 --> 00:26.939
- Whoo!

00:26.983 --> 00:28.506
- We're never going home.

00:28.550 --> 00:29.986
- I got dinner!

00:30.030 --> 00:31.422
- Oh, my God,
that is vile.

00:31.466 --> 00:32.815
- Ahh!

00:32.858 --> 00:34.686
- Slow down!

00:34.730 --> 00:36.514
- No!

00:36.558 --> 00:38.516
- Lindsay!
- I want my mom.
I want my mom.

00:42.085 --> 00:43.043
- I don't know
how we're gonna make it

00:43.086 --> 00:44.261
17 days, though.

00:44.305 --> 00:45.610
- I don't either, man.

00:46.742 --> 00:49.179
- I'm so single unless
somebody comes and, like,

00:49.223 --> 00:50.528
blows me out of
the ----ing water.

00:50.572 --> 00:51.660
- Yeah.

00:51.703 --> 00:52.965
You have to literally
have been sent

00:53.009 --> 00:54.576
by God himself.
- Yeah.

00:58.667 --> 01:00.843
- Did you see his ass?

01:04.412 --> 01:05.891
- I think I'm in love.

01:05.935 --> 01:07.154
- I'm trying
to kidnap you

01:07.197 --> 01:08.938
to bring you home
with me.

01:08.981 --> 01:10.287
- Miss Hubbard!

01:10.331 --> 01:11.549
- So, you're interested
in Lindsay.

01:11.593 --> 01:13.464
- Well, we made out.
- What?

01:13.508 --> 01:15.075
- She also stayed
in my bed.

01:15.118 --> 01:16.859
- How many girls have been
in your bed?

01:16.902 --> 01:18.339
- The mahogany room
don't play.

01:23.344 --> 01:26.303
- Ciara is so pretty.
It is, like, intimidating.

01:26.347 --> 01:28.175
- Are we finding love
in Vermont?

01:28.218 --> 01:30.394
- Vermont's a crazy place.
- Vermont!

01:30.438 --> 01:31.830
- I've been waiting
for your ass to get here.

01:33.223 --> 01:35.312
Oh, no. Oh, no.

01:35.356 --> 01:36.400
- What's happening?

01:36.444 --> 01:38.620
- You know
what's happening.

01:38.663 --> 01:41.275
- Not a threesome.

01:41.318 --> 01:43.668
- Stay.
- I will stay.

01:46.280 --> 01:48.151
- This is why I don't, like,
sleep with people.

01:48.195 --> 01:50.153
I don't wanna
look stupid.

01:50.197 --> 01:51.763
- Kyle was, like, hitting
on me in the hot tub.

01:53.287 --> 01:56.072
- Gabby is hell bent on
lighting this house on fire.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.247
- Anyone seen Amanda?

02:03.949 --> 02:04.820
- I'm in love with you.

02:07.431 --> 02:08.954
- You know
that I ----ing like you.

02:08.998 --> 02:10.608
I cried
after our first date

02:10.652 --> 02:12.436
because I am scared
to like you.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.003
- Hold on.
Let me get this right.

02:14.046 --> 02:16.745
Three girls fighting
over Austen Kroll.

02:18.181 --> 02:19.487
I'm just confused.

02:22.838 --> 02:24.144
- Ugh.

02:24.187 --> 02:26.494
I'm not gonna lie,
my hands are a little cold.

02:47.950 --> 02:49.647
- It looks very mom and pop,
you know?

02:49.691 --> 02:51.997
- It looks like their wi-fi
doesn't work.

02:52.041 --> 02:53.303
I'm just excited
to be in Vermont.

02:53.347 --> 02:55.000
Like, look.
- No, I know.

02:55.044 --> 02:56.132
It's, like,
so picturesque.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.873
- Makes me wanna
make applesauce

02:57.916 --> 02:59.179
and homeschool
my children.

03:00.354 --> 03:02.007
- Let's ----ing go!

03:02.051 --> 03:03.705
- Let's go on
vacation, baby.

03:03.748 --> 03:05.315
- Gettin' ready
to head up to Stowe.

03:05.359 --> 03:07.012
I haven't been
snowboarding in forever.

03:07.056 --> 03:08.144
I can't wait
to hit the hill.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.363
Lookin' forward to it.

03:10.494 --> 03:13.671
- This is, like,
our first vacation

03:13.715 --> 03:15.238
since we got engaged.
- Vacation-- I know.

03:15.282 --> 03:16.283
It's-- it was
a long time coming.

03:16.326 --> 03:17.849
- I'm so excited
to see everyone.

03:17.893 --> 03:19.677
Do we know how many people
are coming?

03:19.721 --> 03:20.678
- We're roughly 12.

03:20.722 --> 03:21.679
- Ciara and Paige
will be there,

03:21.723 --> 03:23.420
and I know Luke,
Craig, and Austen.

03:23.464 --> 03:25.248
- Okay, so, I invited
my friend, Julia.

03:25.292 --> 03:26.510
You're gonna love her.

03:26.554 --> 03:28.599
She's just, like,
a fun, chill girl.

03:28.643 --> 03:29.818
- Yeah.

03:29.861 --> 03:31.515
- And I was like invite
whoever you want.

03:31.559 --> 03:34.039
I only know of, like, one guy
that she's definitely bringing,

03:34.083 --> 03:36.781
but he's, like,
very good-looking.

03:37.913 --> 03:41.264
I stalked his Instagram.
- But is he single?

03:41.308 --> 03:44.876
- I think everyone that
she's bringing is single.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.965
- This sounds like
a recipe for disaster.

03:50.621 --> 03:52.536
- You can't beat
this air.

03:52.580 --> 03:54.277
- That's why I need to be
successful enough, Craig,

03:54.321 --> 03:56.105
to buy
a mountain house.

03:56.148 --> 03:57.889
Charleston air
is so humid.

03:57.933 --> 03:59.369
I'm, like, drippin' wet.

03:59.413 --> 04:01.110
- Dude, it smells like
Christmas out here.

04:01.153 --> 04:03.243
It just makes you
feel good.

04:03.286 --> 04:05.245
How could anything
go wrong?

04:05.288 --> 04:06.681
- And "Stowe" begins, Craig.

04:06.724 --> 04:07.899
- Look at the mountain.
Look at the mountain.

04:07.943 --> 04:09.292
It's ----ing beautiful.

04:09.336 --> 04:11.338
- I feel like we're going
to winter camp right now.

04:11.381 --> 04:12.556
Do you want to
share a bunk bed?

04:13.905 --> 04:15.559
- I've been coming to Stowe
my entire life.

04:15.603 --> 04:18.475
Like, I was on skis
before I could walk.

04:18.519 --> 04:19.650
For the last ten years,

04:19.694 --> 04:21.696
I've been bringing up
about ten guys.

04:21.739 --> 04:24.960
Beers, mullets,
skiing, repeat.

04:25.003 --> 04:26.135
After a weekend,
I'm just like,

04:26.178 --> 04:28.398
yo, I don't think
we can do that again.

04:28.442 --> 04:29.791
A week later, we're like,
that was sick.

04:29.834 --> 04:32.489
Let's do it again.

04:32.533 --> 04:35.100
- I'm gonna check out
the rooms.

04:35.144 --> 04:36.406
Oh, this
is sophisticated.

04:36.450 --> 04:38.103
- Do you think it's
----ed up to pick rooms

04:38.147 --> 04:39.322
before everyone else
gets here?

04:39.366 --> 04:40.845
- I don't really
give a sh--.

04:40.889 --> 04:42.325
Let's go upstairs.

04:42.369 --> 04:45.415
Oh, gettin' to
the big rooms now.

04:45.459 --> 04:46.808
- Now, we're cookin'
with peanut oil.

04:46.851 --> 04:48.331
- You sure you don't wanna
just be partners

04:48.375 --> 04:49.550
and share the room?

04:49.593 --> 04:51.421
- Craig, I've been sayin'
that for years.

04:51.465 --> 04:52.683
This vacation
could not have come

04:52.727 --> 04:54.424
at a more perfect
time for me.

04:54.468 --> 04:58.298
I've been newly single
for three months now.

04:58.341 --> 05:00.909
Madison, I love you
so ----ing much

05:00.952 --> 05:02.476
it, like, hurts.

05:02.519 --> 05:04.347
You know, give me
another chance.

05:04.391 --> 05:09.047
- You're not the one
for me long-term.

05:09.091 --> 05:10.962
- So, when Kyle was like,
"Let's go to Vermont

05:11.006 --> 05:14.444
for two and a half weeks,"
I'm like, "Kyle, say less."

05:14.488 --> 05:17.447
- Dude, there is a hot tub
in the bathroom.

05:17.491 --> 05:18.840
- Let's find
some pretty girls.

05:18.883 --> 05:20.189
I'd like to touch
someone's butt.

05:20.232 --> 05:21.146
- Do you wanna
touch a butt?

05:21.190 --> 05:21.886
- Yeah.

05:21.930 --> 05:23.061
Let's go snowboarding

05:23.105 --> 05:25.412
and let's drink
our faces off.

05:25.455 --> 05:26.804
- Are you goin' upstairs
or second floor?

05:26.848 --> 05:29.372
- I'm gonna do
the adult thing and wait.

05:29.416 --> 05:30.634
- This is perfect.

05:30.678 --> 05:33.333
-
I'm gonna regret this.

05:37.598 --> 05:38.990
- Yo, I'm sittin' here
in the house,

05:39.034 --> 05:41.341
right now, with Craig.
So, what's the, uh...

05:43.430 --> 05:44.561
claiming rooms
and whatnot?

05:44.605 --> 05:46.476
- This is gonna be
my friend.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.478
- My advice is to be like,
"Hey, guys, like,

05:48.522 --> 05:50.654
this is the room that,
like, I would prefer,"

05:50.698 --> 05:52.090
instead of being like,
"This is my room."

05:52.134 --> 05:53.744
- And, Craig, just set up
your sewing machine

05:53.788 --> 05:56.356
in advance, so they kinda
get the message.

05:56.399 --> 05:57.400
- No work--
we're on vacation.

05:57.444 --> 05:58.880
- That's true.

05:58.923 --> 06:00.795
- If you guys so choose
to take the primary bedroom,

06:00.838 --> 06:03.188
there's a six-person
hot tub in there

06:03.232 --> 06:04.929
that overlooks
the mountains.

06:07.671 --> 06:09.586
- We are literally
ten minutes away. So...

06:09.630 --> 06:12.241
- All right.
We'll see you guys soon. Bye.

06:12.284 --> 06:13.721
- [BLEEP]!
Those mother----ers beat us.

06:15.679 --> 06:16.941
- I'm gonna shovel this

06:16.985 --> 06:19.030
'cause someone is gonna
eat ass, right here.

06:19.074 --> 06:20.597
- Guilty.

06:22.164 --> 06:23.208
- So cute.

06:23.252 --> 06:24.296
- And we have lift-off.

06:24.340 --> 06:26.168
- Hello?

06:27.256 --> 06:27.952
- I don't know.

06:27.996 --> 06:29.258
- What's up?
- Hello.

06:29.301 --> 06:30.781
- Hi. I'm Gabby.
Nice to meet you.

06:30.825 --> 06:31.956
- I'm Craig,
nice to meet you, too.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.697
- Hey, Gabby, I'm Austen.
- Hi, Austen.

06:33.741 --> 06:35.960
- Nice to meet ya.
- And I have a favor.

06:36.004 --> 06:37.484
Can you guys help me
with my bags?

06:37.527 --> 06:38.441
- Yeah, sure.
- Of course.

06:38.485 --> 06:40.182
- Okay, thank you.

06:40.225 --> 06:41.270
- Where are you
comin' in from?

06:41.313 --> 06:43.925
- New York.
- Oh, cool.

06:43.968 --> 06:45.622
- So, which bag?

06:45.666 --> 06:49.931
- The pink one, the gold one,
and then the big gold suitcase,

06:49.974 --> 06:51.759
and the Chanel.
I have a lotta stuff.

06:51.802 --> 06:53.543
- Yeah, you just lean up there
and just-- just hang out.

06:53.587 --> 06:56.285
- Okay, I'll just be cute.
Okay, and we're good.

06:56.328 --> 06:57.547
- Who do you know?

06:57.591 --> 06:59.723
- Julia, and Julia is
friends with Paige.

06:59.767 --> 07:01.377
- Okay, so, Paige.
- And Julia missed her flight.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.683
- Oh, no way.
- So...

07:02.726 --> 07:05.076
we won't see her
'til tomorrow.

07:05.120 --> 07:07.383
Um, do I just pick a room?
Do I just go?

07:07.427 --> 07:08.819
- We don't really know.

07:08.863 --> 07:10.734
- So, we have different
theories on it. I-- I did.

07:10.778 --> 07:12.910
Austen set his suitcase
somewhere and was like,

07:12.954 --> 07:14.129
"I'm just gonna
tell everyone

07:14.172 --> 07:15.478
"that I prefer
this room."

07:15.522 --> 07:18.438
If it was my call,
I say pick one.

07:18.481 --> 07:21.658
- Oh, wow!
Okay, I want this one.

07:21.702 --> 07:24.356
Found it.
I like space.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.097
I have six siblings.

07:26.141 --> 07:27.316
Because of six siblings,

07:27.359 --> 07:29.405
I've had to be
absolutely dominant,

07:29.449 --> 07:30.580
or you will get
taken advantage of

07:30.624 --> 07:33.365
by all of them.

07:33.409 --> 07:34.628
So, I found the big room,

07:34.671 --> 07:37.413
and I'm taking it
'cause the closet.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.154
- "I'm taking it."
- Yeah.

07:39.197 --> 07:40.329
- Amanda and Kyle
are coming in,

07:40.372 --> 07:41.373
and they're a couple,
so we were like,

07:41.417 --> 07:42.418
well, we'll just
leave it for them.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.768
- Oh, sh--. Sh--.
I'm a bitch.

07:44.812 --> 07:46.553
- I love it.
- Hey, girl, own it.

07:46.596 --> 07:49.773
- Gotta go.
- Oh, sh--.

07:53.821 --> 07:56.301
I just think that's
a wrong move on her part.

07:56.345 --> 07:58.260
That's a ----in' lot,
right there.

07:58.303 --> 08:00.523
- Dude,
they're firewood sleds,

08:00.567 --> 08:04.527
but we can 100% launch down
this ----in' hill.

08:04.571 --> 08:07.878
- Vermont, baby.
- Whoo!

08:07.922 --> 08:10.315
- Honey, I'm home!

08:10.359 --> 08:12.492
- Oh, sh--.
- Hello?

08:12.535 --> 08:13.754
- Hello, hello!

08:13.797 --> 08:15.495
- Drunk Austen
wants to go sledding.

08:15.538 --> 08:16.800
- Drunk Gabby
is totally doing it.

08:16.844 --> 08:17.671
- We'll throw our--
we have helmets.

08:17.714 --> 08:20.325
- Hello!
- Hello!

08:20.369 --> 08:21.718
- What's up?
- Hi.

08:21.762 --> 08:22.980
Oh, my God,
you're drinking already.

08:23.024 --> 08:24.982
- Of course, I am.
- Thank God.

08:25.026 --> 08:27.158
Hi. I'm Amanda.
- What's going on, man?

08:27.202 --> 08:27.898
- I'm Gabby.
- Oh, sorry, I just
stepped on your toe.

08:27.942 --> 08:29.334
- Oh, my God!

08:29.378 --> 08:30.335
Dude, I haven't
seen you guys.

08:30.379 --> 08:31.554
- I know.
It's been a while.

08:31.598 --> 08:32.990
- Was it last summer
or two summers ago?

08:33.034 --> 08:33.991
- Two summers.

08:34.035 --> 08:35.210
- How are you, man?

08:35.253 --> 08:36.341
Happy birthday.
- Thanks for comin', man.

08:36.385 --> 08:37.342
Whoo!
- Dude.

08:37.386 --> 08:39.170
- How are you doing?
Come here.

08:39.214 --> 08:40.520
- What is there to drink?

08:40.563 --> 08:41.521
- They're drinking
dark liquor.

08:41.564 --> 08:43.000
I don't do that.
I got Prosecco.

08:43.044 --> 08:45.307
I was like, it's a girls' drink.
- Yes. Hello, please.

08:45.350 --> 08:46.308
- Gabby.

08:49.572 --> 08:50.704
- It's Paige's
friend's friend.

08:54.490 --> 08:55.665
- I don't even know
what's left.

08:55.709 --> 08:56.927
- Do you guys always
get the big room?

08:56.971 --> 08:58.668
- I will tell you,
I would choose a backup

08:58.712 --> 09:01.366
because Kyle is Kyle.

09:01.410 --> 09:03.064
- Let me choose a backup.

09:03.107 --> 09:04.456
- Have you guys been
to Vermont before?

09:04.500 --> 09:05.370
- Never.
- Not 'til now.

09:05.414 --> 09:07.024
- No one?

09:07.068 --> 09:07.938
We're gonna
have to get you guys,

09:07.982 --> 09:09.853
like, cheese,
maple syrup.

09:09.897 --> 09:11.551
I do love
sharing Vermont

09:11.594 --> 09:13.378
with, like, basically
all my friends.

09:13.422 --> 09:15.729
My mom's from Vermont.
My parents met here in Stowe.

09:15.772 --> 09:17.208
- Oh, so, you're
owning this.

09:17.252 --> 09:19.341
- My family is, like,
a couple miles away.

09:19.384 --> 09:20.951
- Oh, that's cool.

09:20.995 --> 09:22.692
- But I didn't wanna have us
all stay with my grandmother.

09:22.736 --> 09:23.954
- That would have been
so sweet, though.

09:23.998 --> 09:24.651
- So, like, that's what's
you grew up doing,

09:24.694 --> 09:26.087
was coming up here.

09:26.130 --> 09:27.958
- Yeah, the whole family skis
until I met Amanda.

09:28.002 --> 09:30.091
I'm just kidding.
- I'm not family yet.

09:30.134 --> 09:32.572
- We're workin' on it.

09:33.877 --> 09:35.618
- Oh, my God.
- This is gonna be good.

09:35.662 --> 09:37.141
- Chateau vibes.
- Yeah.

09:37.185 --> 09:38.142
- Hello?

09:38.186 --> 09:40.231
- Oh, my God,
this is so great!

09:40.275 --> 09:41.668
- Bitches!

09:41.711 --> 09:42.886
- Look at that view.

09:42.930 --> 09:47.761
- Amanda!
Oh, my God, hi!

09:47.804 --> 09:49.327
- Hi. I'm Gabby.
Nice to meet you.

09:49.371 --> 09:50.546
- Hi. I'm Ciara.
Nice to meet you.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.983
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my gosh, hi.

09:53.027 --> 09:55.072
- Hi. I-- I'll hug you.
- Hi. I'm Gabby.

09:55.116 --> 09:56.247
Nice to meet you.
- Hi. I'm Paige.

09:56.291 --> 09:57.292
So nice to meet you.
- Hi.

09:57.335 --> 09:58.772
- Oh, your hair
smells good.

09:58.815 --> 10:01.339
We brought a ton of food,
and we have all of our bags.

10:01.383 --> 10:02.776
- Ut-oh.
- Hey, I'm Austen.

10:02.819 --> 10:05.082
Let's hug it out.
- Ciara. Nice to meet you.

10:05.126 --> 10:06.127
- How are you?
- Good to see ya.

10:06.170 --> 10:07.868
- Good to see you.
- Oh, my God.

10:07.911 --> 10:09.870
- Oh, my God, I got makeup
on your white sweatshirt.

10:09.913 --> 10:11.088
- I'm Craig.
- Ciara. Nice to meet you.

10:11.132 --> 10:12.612
- You, too.
- First things first.

10:12.655 --> 10:14.614
We're gonna do a shot.
- Whoo!

10:14.657 --> 10:16.572
- I love the energy.
- I like shots.

10:16.616 --> 10:17.965
- Do you like tequila.

10:18.008 --> 10:19.662
- I mean, like, I can't
drink a shot of tequila

10:19.706 --> 10:20.881
if I'm gonna make it
through the night. So, like...

10:20.924 --> 10:21.882
- So, you want a shot
of vodka?

10:21.925 --> 10:23.100
What are you? Russian?
- Yeah.

10:23.144 --> 10:26.016
- She's actually
a Russian oligarch.

10:26.060 --> 10:27.757
- Okay, so, I know
we're missing some people

10:27.801 --> 10:30.325
but to the best
winter vacation ever.

10:30.368 --> 10:31.369
You better get ----ed up,

10:31.413 --> 10:32.327
and you better have fun.
- Yeah.

10:32.370 --> 10:33.197
- And if you don't,
go home.

10:33.241 --> 10:35.330
- House credo!

10:35.373 --> 10:36.636
- I love this for me.

10:36.679 --> 10:38.115
- I love this for us.
- Oh, that was good.

10:38.159 --> 10:41.858
- Let's look at rooms.
- I'm ready. Come on.

10:41.902 --> 10:43.512
All right, do you wanna
start downstairs?

10:43.555 --> 10:44.600
- I'm not living down there--
- Yeah.

10:44.644 --> 10:45.688
- So I don't even
wanna see it.

10:45.732 --> 10:48.430
- Welcome to Vermont!
- Oh, sh--.

10:48.473 --> 10:50.824
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

10:50.867 --> 10:53.740
- Oh, he bailed.

10:53.783 --> 10:55.306
- Oh, I see bags.

10:55.350 --> 10:58.788
- So, Austen and Craig have
put their bags into rooms.

10:58.832 --> 11:01.486
- Okay.
- Oh...

11:01.530 --> 11:03.532
- Is this another closet?

11:03.575 --> 11:05.316
- This whole thing
is a closet.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.275
- Oh, my God.

11:07.318 --> 11:09.451
Guys, what if...

11:14.761 --> 11:16.893
- Look at
non confrontational Amanda.

11:16.937 --> 11:17.851
- I--
- She's like

11:17.894 --> 11:20.331
I'm not saying anything.
- Yes.

11:20.375 --> 11:21.550
- Full force!
Let's go!

11:21.593 --> 11:23.160
- All right,
bank at the end.

11:23.204 --> 11:25.728
- Yeah, baby!

11:25.772 --> 11:28.470
- Oh, God, roll over!
Roll over!

11:32.692 --> 11:34.041
- Gabby, are you single?

11:34.084 --> 11:35.738
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, nice, nice.

11:35.782 --> 11:36.870
- You guys?

11:36.913 --> 11:38.045
- Oh, my God,
I'm so single.

11:38.088 --> 11:39.916
- I couldn't
be more single.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.831
She's not, obviously.
- Not really.

11:41.875 --> 11:43.354
- No, I know. Yeah.
- I can be.

11:43.398 --> 11:44.399
- Wow.

11:44.442 --> 11:45.705
- You have a girlfriend.
- Natalie.

11:45.748 --> 11:47.532
- How is she?
- She's great.

11:47.576 --> 11:49.012
She's gonna be in Park City
for the next, like,

11:49.056 --> 11:49.839
two weeks.
- Congrats.

11:49.883 --> 11:51.014
- And then Switzerland.

11:51.058 --> 11:53.713
- Well, ain't that bougie.

11:53.756 --> 11:55.366
- Natalie and I
have been together

11:55.410 --> 11:56.846
almost ten months now.

11:56.890 --> 11:58.543
- What better way
to get to know someone

11:58.587 --> 12:00.241
than lock them in a house?

12:00.284 --> 12:02.373
- And see if they
kill each other or not.

12:02.417 --> 12:05.028
I love Natalie to death,
and I think this trip

12:05.072 --> 12:07.552
is really important
for me to go on

12:07.596 --> 12:09.293
to see if I miss her.

12:09.337 --> 12:12.253
I need to figure my stuff out
because there's two outcomes.

12:12.296 --> 12:14.472
You either get married,
or you break up,

12:14.516 --> 12:15.952
and breakups suck.

12:15.996 --> 12:17.780
- There's been many times
that Paige and I were like,

12:17.824 --> 12:19.608
could you imagine
if we were single together?

12:19.651 --> 12:21.218
And I'm so envious of this.

12:21.262 --> 12:23.220
- Single Paige has--
do you see this?

12:23.264 --> 12:25.614
No strings.

12:25.657 --> 12:27.224
I've been bopping
around the town,

12:27.268 --> 12:30.053
going on multiple dates.
Got ghosted a few times.

12:30.097 --> 12:31.751
Ghosted a few people.

12:31.794 --> 12:33.578
It's been wild out there
the past six months.

12:33.622 --> 12:35.145
I'm not gonna lie.

12:35.189 --> 12:36.625
Let's go through some frogs

12:36.668 --> 12:40.194
before we get to
that prince, you know?

12:40.237 --> 12:41.586
- Okay.

12:41.630 --> 12:44.198
- Door.

12:44.241 --> 12:45.808
- Hello?

12:45.852 --> 12:47.070
- Hi!
- I'm Jason.

12:47.114 --> 12:48.768
- I'm Paige.
Nice to meet you.

12:48.811 --> 12:49.769
- Paige, nice to meet you.
- Wait.

12:49.812 --> 12:50.813
- Sick fit.
I'm into that fit.

12:50.857 --> 12:52.815
- Like, yeah.
Do you want a drink?

12:52.859 --> 12:53.903
- Do I?

12:53.947 --> 12:56.253
- Vodka, we have
peanut butter whiskey.

12:56.297 --> 12:57.559
- Is Julia here?

12:57.602 --> 12:59.300
- She missed her flight.
She's coming tomorrow.

12:59.343 --> 13:00.736
- Oh, my God, all right.
- How's it goin'?

13:00.780 --> 13:02.085
- Hello. Jason.
- Craig.

13:02.129 --> 13:03.304
Good to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you.

13:03.347 --> 13:04.566
Is anyone gonna cheers
with me over here?

13:04.609 --> 13:05.872
- Yeah, I'll do it.

13:05.915 --> 13:06.960
- We gotta do shots
every time somebody new

13:07.003 --> 13:08.613
comes to the house.
- I love it.

13:08.657 --> 13:11.007
- I'm really surprised at
all these beautiful women

13:11.051 --> 13:12.139
that Julia is friends with

13:12.182 --> 13:14.315
that she has not
introduced me to before.

13:14.358 --> 13:15.795
Cheers.

13:15.838 --> 13:18.275
When it comes to women,
I like strong, independent,

13:18.319 --> 13:21.017
classy, intelligence,
good-looking.

13:22.932 --> 13:24.586
- Yeah, always looking
for the unicorn.

13:26.980 --> 13:28.590
- Should we get
the food out of the car?

13:28.633 --> 13:30.810
- Okay. Wait!
- Oh!

13:30.853 --> 13:31.898
Oh, apples.

13:31.941 --> 13:33.160
- Let's just put 'em
in the box.

13:33.203 --> 13:34.204
- Shoot.

13:34.248 --> 13:35.815
They were the cutest apples,
too.

13:35.858 --> 13:37.207
- They're good.

13:37.251 --> 13:40.428
Who is that?

13:45.389 --> 13:46.477
- It is.
- It is.

13:46.521 --> 13:47.827
Reel it in. Reel it in.
Reel it in.

13:50.742 --> 13:52.919
Hi. How are you?
- Hi. How are you?

13:52.962 --> 13:54.181
Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

13:54.224 --> 13:56.400
Oh, my God, you're, like,
so business casual.

13:56.444 --> 13:57.358
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

13:57.401 --> 13:58.968
I'm Paige.
- Muah.

13:59.012 --> 14:00.970
Andrea. Nice meeting you.
- Love a double kiss, yeah.

14:01.014 --> 14:02.885
- Hi. Ciara.
Oh, muah.

14:02.929 --> 14:04.104
- Sorry.
- Wait. What's routine?

14:04.147 --> 14:05.627
To go which,
left or right?

14:05.670 --> 14:06.889
- I go right first
and then left.

14:06.933 --> 14:08.499
- Okay, let's do that.

14:08.543 --> 14:09.979
Muah, muah.
- Muah.

14:10.023 --> 14:10.893
- Hi. Amanda.
- Hi.

14:10.937 --> 14:11.633
Andrea.
Nice meeting you.

14:11.676 --> 14:13.548
Muah.
- Oh.

14:13.591 --> 14:16.072
We're gonna grab the food,
and then we'll be right in.

14:16.116 --> 14:17.552
- Okay, keep it in.
Keep it in.

14:17.595 --> 14:19.162
Hold it in for a second.

14:20.685 --> 14:22.078
- Hello?

14:22.122 --> 14:24.385
- Did you see his ass?

14:24.428 --> 14:25.821
Paige, call your mom.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.344
Tell her to
book the venue.

14:27.388 --> 14:29.346
This is it.

14:29.390 --> 14:30.521
- Coming up...

14:30.565 --> 14:32.001
- Who is already in a room,
right now?

14:32.045 --> 14:33.002
Let's do rooms.
- I already have a room.

14:33.046 --> 14:34.221
- I have my room.

14:34.264 --> 14:35.004
No one is gonna kick me
out of my room.

14:35.048 --> 14:36.353
- Don't worry.

14:36.397 --> 14:37.398
I'm gonna try to make an igloo
and live in that.

14:37.441 --> 14:38.616
- Take me with you.

14:40.923 --> 14:42.142
- What the ----in' sh--
is this?

14:42.185 --> 14:44.100
- Oh, my God.
- Go! Get outta here!

14:44.144 --> 14:47.234
- I'm walking into,
like, a full-blown orgy.

14:51.803 --> 14:53.109
- Did you see his ass?

14:53.153 --> 14:54.458
Paige, call your mom.

14:54.502 --> 14:57.461
Tell her to book the venue.
This is it.

14:57.505 --> 14:58.941
- Hey.
- What up?

14:58.985 --> 15:00.638
I'm Kyle.
- Nice to meet you.

15:00.682 --> 15:02.945
- Did you-did you just walk in,
and you avoid all those girls?

15:02.989 --> 15:06.949
- If he likes brown girls,
game over, bitch.

15:06.993 --> 15:08.777
- No, actually,
I introduced myself.

15:08.820 --> 15:10.083
- Oh, my bad.

15:10.126 --> 15:11.954
And did they give you
a warm welcome?

15:11.998 --> 15:13.173
- Yeah, they
were really nice.

15:13.216 --> 15:15.740
We hug each other.
We kissed. So...

15:15.784 --> 15:16.785
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:16.828 --> 15:17.786
- Holy sh--.

15:17.829 --> 15:19.179
- I-I taught them
the Italian way.

15:19.222 --> 15:22.182
Right first.
Left after.

15:22.225 --> 15:24.271
I'm originally from
Verona, Italy,

15:24.314 --> 15:26.273
city of Romeo and Juliet.

15:26.316 --> 15:28.797
Because of my roots,
I'm a romantic guy.

15:28.840 --> 15:30.364
I love the ladies.

15:30.407 --> 15:32.975
My dream has always been
marry an American girl

15:33.019 --> 15:33.976
and move back to Italy.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.717
So, I'm kind of
excited to...

15:37.371 --> 15:39.155
Get to know
some beautiful girls.

15:39.199 --> 15:40.548
Hey, what's up?
- Hello.

15:40.591 --> 15:42.724
I'm gonna give you a bump.
- This is Jason.

15:42.767 --> 15:44.204
- Oh, my God,
it's Andrea.

15:44.247 --> 15:45.988
- Wait, so, you guys don't
know each other?

15:46.032 --> 15:47.468
- No, we never met.
- But you know her.

15:47.511 --> 15:49.165
- Yeah, we know each other
from modeling.

15:49.209 --> 15:50.993
- But all three of us
know Julia.

15:52.299 --> 15:54.997
- We can't have pasta
sauce from a ----ing jar.

15:55.041 --> 15:56.303
- As an Italian woman...
- Yeah.

15:56.346 --> 15:58.000
- And an Italian man
from Italy...

15:58.044 --> 15:59.697
- Yeah.
- With an Italian accent,

15:59.741 --> 16:01.830
you brought Italian food
from a grocery store.

16:01.873 --> 16:03.136
- Yeah, it was
an oversight.

16:03.179 --> 16:04.528
It was an oversight.
Sorry.

16:04.572 --> 16:06.835
I feel like my husband
is inside, so I gotta go.

16:06.878 --> 16:08.968
- So, you two
are assigned to me.

16:09.011 --> 16:10.752
- Okay, we will
take care of her.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.407
- I think you're more
than enough, my friend.

16:19.543 --> 16:20.805
- Wow.

16:20.849 --> 16:22.416
- I keep thinking that
your beanie is, like,

16:22.459 --> 16:24.070
a Carolina Panthers beanie.

16:24.113 --> 16:25.332
- Are you a Panther fan?

16:25.375 --> 16:27.029
- Oh, my God, absolutely.
- Yes.

16:28.726 --> 16:30.685
- What's up?

16:30.728 --> 16:32.121
- Oh.
- It's Lukie.

16:32.165 --> 16:34.080
- What's goin' on?
- Hey, buddy.

16:34.123 --> 16:35.211
- Good to see you.

16:35.255 --> 16:36.212
Sorry my hands are cold.
- No, it's okay.

16:36.256 --> 16:37.213
- Hey, buddy.
- What's up, man?

16:37.257 --> 16:38.127
Luke, brother.
- Luke, Austen.

16:38.171 --> 16:39.389
- I've heard a lot about you.

16:39.433 --> 16:40.347
- I was at y'all's house
what, two years ago

16:40.390 --> 16:41.217
or whatever?
- Yeah.

16:41.261 --> 16:42.131
- Are you flirting with me?

16:42.175 --> 16:43.741
- Maybe I need
a New York girl.

16:43.785 --> 16:45.352
- I don't think you
can handle a New York girl.

16:45.395 --> 16:47.180
- I'd like to try.
That's for sure.

16:47.223 --> 16:48.355
You're, like, the only one
that I didn't meet.

16:48.398 --> 16:49.443
- I know.

16:49.486 --> 16:50.705
Cold weather, it's--
it's my element.

16:50.748 --> 16:52.359
I love snowboarding.
I love snowmobiling.

16:52.402 --> 16:53.969
I love ice fishing.
I love playing hockey,

16:54.013 --> 16:55.797
snow forts,
cross country skiing,

16:55.840 --> 16:57.668
snowshoeing,
winter camping.

16:57.712 --> 16:59.583
The time of year is
to actually tap trees

16:59.627 --> 17:00.889
for maple, right now.

17:00.932 --> 17:02.108
- There's, like,
a sledding hill

17:02.151 --> 17:03.239
that you have to hit that sled.
- Yeah.

17:05.328 --> 17:06.764
- Well, not really.

17:06.808 --> 17:09.550
I'd much rather get laid
than tap a maple tree.

17:11.117 --> 17:12.944
- Freezer, freezer.
- What's up, Paige?

17:12.988 --> 17:14.033
How ya doin'?
- What's up, Luke?

17:14.076 --> 17:17.079
- Oh, Lucas is here.
- Oh!

17:17.123 --> 17:18.646
- I know.
I'm like you now.

17:18.689 --> 17:20.561
- No, no, no,
stop pouring vodka.

17:20.604 --> 17:22.650
Normal people don't
take vodka shots.

17:22.693 --> 17:23.651
- Normal people?

17:23.694 --> 17:25.087
- Hi, I'm Gabby.
Nice to meet you.

17:25.131 --> 17:26.175
- Gabby, Luke,
nice to meet you.

17:26.219 --> 17:27.568
- Nice to meet you.
- Luke, Jason.

17:27.611 --> 17:28.743
- All right.

17:28.786 --> 17:30.701
- Cheers to getting drunk
with you guys.

17:32.834 --> 17:34.096
-
What is that?

17:34.140 --> 17:35.619
I think I just mixed
three different alcohols.

17:35.663 --> 17:38.100
- Okay, we gotta figure out
rooms tonight, right?

17:38.144 --> 17:39.493
So, I think--
- Is this the whole house?

17:39.536 --> 17:41.408
- This is everyone
that's gonna be here tonight.

17:41.451 --> 17:45.107
- We wanna talk rooms?
Who needs a sword?

17:45.151 --> 17:47.109
- Before we talk rooms, like,
let's talk dinner.

17:47.153 --> 17:49.503
Me and Paige brought
pizzas and pasta.

17:49.546 --> 17:51.853
No matter how
this room situation goes,

17:51.896 --> 17:53.202
we're all sitting
at that table

17:53.246 --> 17:55.509
and having
a dinner together, okay?

17:55.552 --> 17:56.771
- Yes.

17:56.814 --> 17:58.599
- Okay, so, there's enough rooms
for everyone

17:58.642 --> 18:01.906
to get their own room,
currently, right now.

18:01.950 --> 18:03.125
- But, like,
when the other people come...

18:03.169 --> 18:04.909
- So, we're ten,
and we're gonna be twelve.

18:04.953 --> 18:05.693
- Yes.

18:05.736 --> 18:07.347
- So, here is how I feel.

18:07.390 --> 18:10.480
I want the primary bedroom,
and I will share it with Ciara.

18:12.700 --> 18:15.094
- I can't believe
you just said that but okay.

18:15.137 --> 18:16.399
- I haven't even
looked at the rooms.

18:16.443 --> 18:18.967
- So, Craig and I
did take a room.

18:19.010 --> 18:20.360
- Yeah, which was rude.

18:20.403 --> 18:21.970
- You just asked for
the primary bedroom.

18:22.013 --> 18:23.145
Talk about bein' rude.

18:23.189 --> 18:24.146
- You shouldn't have
even been talking.

18:24.190 --> 18:25.365
You already have
a ----ing room.

18:25.408 --> 18:27.889
- My stuff is tentatively
in a bedroom.

18:27.932 --> 18:29.325
- No, your--
it was all over.

18:29.369 --> 18:31.458
- Hey, hey,
for the love of God.

18:31.501 --> 18:33.024
- We are also two people.

18:33.068 --> 18:35.636
We should have a bathroom
and a closet that we can share.

18:35.679 --> 18:37.028
- Guys, can I
make this simple?

18:37.072 --> 18:38.247
- I have my room.

18:38.291 --> 18:39.422
No one is gonna kick me
out of my room.

18:39.466 --> 18:40.684
- Who is already in
a room, right now?

18:40.728 --> 18:41.816
- I already have a room.

18:41.859 --> 18:43.470
I already
unloaded my sh--.

18:43.513 --> 18:45.167
- I haven't even looked at
a goddamn room

18:45.211 --> 18:46.516
and people
are takin' rooms!

18:46.560 --> 18:48.692
- Let's give Luke a tour.
- Thank you.

18:48.736 --> 18:51.478
- Vacation is startin' off
with a bang.

18:51.521 --> 18:53.001
- Luke, Luke,
I wanna see it, too.

18:53.044 --> 18:54.524
- Oh-Oh, my God,
I'm so sorry.

18:54.568 --> 18:55.830
I didn't mean to
leave you out.

18:55.873 --> 18:56.831
- Ciara, can you be my guide,
as well, please?

18:56.874 --> 18:57.832
- Yes.

18:57.875 --> 18:58.789
There's a bathroom
in this one.

18:58.833 --> 19:01.009
- This is mine.
Done.

19:01.052 --> 19:02.489
- Jason needs a room!

19:02.532 --> 19:04.143
- Dude, I've never dealt with

19:04.186 --> 19:08.016
a more hostile ----ing group
over bedrooms.

19:08.059 --> 19:09.583
- Really?

19:09.626 --> 19:11.411
- I'm assuming this is just
gonna resolve itself, right?

19:11.454 --> 19:13.369
Like, no one just shows up
to a house

19:13.413 --> 19:16.198
that they had no involvement
in planning whatsoever

19:16.242 --> 19:18.026
and just expects
the best bedroom.

19:18.069 --> 19:19.332
Fact!

19:19.375 --> 19:21.203
I'm spitting 'cause I'm like,
what the [BLEEP]?

19:21.247 --> 19:22.683
- I'm just not gonna go and,
like, arm wrestle

19:22.726 --> 19:23.684
with someone for
a ----ing room.

19:23.727 --> 19:25.076
- No, 100%.

19:25.120 --> 19:26.687
- Take this one.

19:26.730 --> 19:28.558
- I just don't need anybody,
like, asserting their dominance.

19:28.602 --> 19:30.778
- You get naked in the morning,
and you say,

19:30.821 --> 19:34.825
"What's up!"
- Ahh!

19:34.869 --> 19:37.132
- I'm gonna go ahead
and lay down the law.

19:37.176 --> 19:40.222
We are taking
the primary bedroom, okay?

19:40.266 --> 19:41.789
- Paige and Ciara talked,
and they have it.

19:41.832 --> 19:43.312
- Let me help you.
This is so heavy.

19:43.356 --> 19:45.619
- Oh, wow, thank you.
- Where?

19:45.662 --> 19:47.577
- To the biggest bedroom.
Thank you, sir.

19:47.621 --> 19:49.884
- No, wait.
What about the couple?

19:49.927 --> 19:51.581
- We-we're a couple.

19:53.975 --> 19:54.976
- You can
in any room.

19:55.019 --> 19:56.064
- We-we appreciate
it so much.

19:56.107 --> 19:59.328
To the primary bedroom.

19:59.372 --> 20:00.547
- Things are gonna work out.

20:00.590 --> 20:01.896
- Dude, no,
but I'm just saying.

20:01.939 --> 20:03.114
- No one-- shh.

20:03.158 --> 20:04.507
- I'm trying to figure out
which bedroom

20:04.551 --> 20:06.509
you actually put us into
'cause you ----ed up.

20:06.553 --> 20:08.207
- I don't--
I didn't up.

20:08.250 --> 20:09.251
- Oh, really?

20:09.295 --> 20:10.339
- I don't want people
to hate us

20:10.383 --> 20:12.080
when we go downstairs either.

20:12.123 --> 20:13.429
- Hate us for what?

20:13.473 --> 20:15.301
They said they wanted
a bedroom with a bathroom

20:15.344 --> 20:16.563
and a closet.

20:16.606 --> 20:18.521
They should find one.

20:18.565 --> 20:19.957
- I don't know
where we're sleeping,

20:20.001 --> 20:20.915
so there is that.

20:20.958 --> 20:22.656
- Okay, I did not know.

20:22.699 --> 20:24.658
- How exciting
does this look?

20:24.701 --> 20:25.789
- You get a little high
off this.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.400
- I just like looking
at my clothes.

20:27.443 --> 20:29.880
It makes me happy
to look at pretty things.

20:29.924 --> 20:33.928
- We got ----ed and--
and by your friends.

20:33.971 --> 20:35.277
- Don't worry.

20:35.321 --> 20:36.409
I'm gonna try and make an igloo
in a couple days

20:36.452 --> 20:37.845
and live in that.
- Take me with you.

20:37.888 --> 20:40.717
- I'm just over this sh--.
- Oh, God.

20:40.761 --> 20:42.328
- Oh, Kyle's gettin' hammered.
I love it.

20:42.371 --> 20:45.331
- Kyle! Kyle!
Kyle!

20:45.374 --> 20:46.941
You're being ridiculous!

20:46.984 --> 20:49.117
- What is this,
a ----ing frat house?

20:50.814 --> 20:52.076
- Coming up...

20:52.120 --> 20:53.774
- What would you give up,
oral sex or cheese?

20:53.817 --> 20:56.255
- I will eat cheese over dick
any day of the week.

21:00.128 --> 21:02.348
- I'm just over this sh--.

21:02.391 --> 21:03.610
- Oh, God.

21:03.653 --> 21:04.524
- Oh, Kyle is gettin' hammered.
I love it.

21:04.567 --> 21:07.483
- Kyle! Kyle!
Kyle!

21:09.485 --> 21:12.140
- Oh, damn,
those are good beers, man.

21:12.183 --> 21:13.097
[BLEEP]!

21:13.141 --> 21:14.708
- That was not
my intention.

21:14.751 --> 21:17.188
I didn't know
that was glass.

21:17.232 --> 21:20.017
I'm fine.
- You're so angry.

21:20.061 --> 21:23.412
I don't wanna deal
with the room situation.

21:23.456 --> 21:25.501
- What an actual animal.

21:25.545 --> 21:26.850
- Look, fine,
I'll share a room with you

21:26.894 --> 21:29.244
if we have to, okay?
Fine, Ciara.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.419
- Oh, my God,
I don't wanna have to

21:30.463 --> 21:31.725
twist your arm.

21:31.768 --> 21:32.769
Like, holy sh--.
- Fine.

21:34.902 --> 21:37.339
- Paige, no--
no more of this, please.

21:37.383 --> 21:39.254
- Sorry, I--
I didn't know.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.342
- Next time,
we go together.

21:40.386 --> 21:41.822
- Okay, good.
Thank you.

21:41.865 --> 21:43.345
- Amanda, this is
what they call pizza.

21:43.389 --> 21:45.042
- Oh, yeah, the pizza.
I got the oven.

21:45.086 --> 21:46.653
It's a-ready.

21:46.696 --> 21:49.917
- This is the biggest blasphemy
I've ever seen in my life.

21:49.960 --> 21:51.222
- Do you cook a lot?

21:51.266 --> 21:54.356
- Uh, next question.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.053
- He's like--
he's like, "No, but I"...

21:56.097 --> 21:57.490
- Okay.

21:57.533 --> 21:57.881
- If I have a beautiful girl
next to me, I can cook.

21:57.925 --> 21:59.100
- Right.

21:59.143 --> 22:00.493
- If I'm by myself--
- What's the point?

22:00.536 --> 22:01.537
- Exactly.
- Right.

22:01.581 --> 22:02.669
- Ciara, let me help you.

22:02.712 --> 22:04.323
- I love the way
Italians say my name.

22:04.366 --> 22:06.063
Say my name.

22:07.500 --> 22:08.588
- Amanda.

22:08.631 --> 22:11.242
- He's ----ing suave.

22:11.286 --> 22:13.070
- My ex-boyfriend
was Italian.

22:13.114 --> 22:14.550
- So, you like that
experience, though.

22:14.594 --> 22:15.421
- Love.
- Okay, great.

22:15.464 --> 22:16.378
- Love.

22:16.422 --> 22:18.511
- Until he bangs
my girlfriend.

22:18.554 --> 22:19.729
- Wait. Who is
your girlfriend?

22:19.773 --> 22:20.948
- I'm kidding. I don't
have a girlfriend.

22:20.991 --> 22:22.253
- Ahh!

22:22.297 --> 22:23.690
- This is fruity and fun.

22:23.733 --> 22:25.822
- It is fruiter
than alcohol. Cheers.

22:25.866 --> 22:27.824
- Fruity and fun.
- To friends.

22:27.868 --> 22:31.480
- I absolutely love meeting
new people and fun people,

22:31.524 --> 22:33.003
and I'm glad
you guys are here.

22:33.047 --> 22:35.092
- No, I'm so happy
I met you guys first,

22:35.136 --> 22:36.790
honest to God.

22:36.833 --> 22:40.837
I am an introvert, and what kind
of an introvert goes to a house

22:40.881 --> 22:43.187
with strangers without
their best friend?

22:43.231 --> 22:45.625
Me, apparently.

22:45.668 --> 22:48.410
I can see that this is going
to be a lot to handle for me.

22:49.933 --> 22:52.283
- Hey, can you believe that
me and you are cooking?

22:57.811 --> 23:00.291
- Lins, it's room situation,

23:00.335 --> 23:02.424
and being ----in'
nuts about it.

23:02.468 --> 23:03.686
- Don't sweat
the small stuff.

23:03.730 --> 23:05.514
Like, forget about it.

23:05.558 --> 23:07.037
Forget about it.

23:07.081 --> 23:09.431
Let them, like,
duke it out on their own.

23:09.475 --> 23:10.998
- Yeah.

23:12.478 --> 23:13.827
- Whoa!
Look at this sh--!

23:13.870 --> 23:15.132
- You look good,
though, babe.

23:15.176 --> 23:16.743
You look all white
and sh--.

23:16.786 --> 23:18.614
- I wish I was there.
I just have to, like,

23:18.658 --> 23:21.138
finish up some last minute,
like, work stuff

23:21.182 --> 23:24.794
before I launch into
full blown vacation mode.

23:24.838 --> 23:26.448
- With all the chaos
going on in the house,

23:26.492 --> 23:28.363
I can't wait for my girl,
Lindsay, to get here.

23:28.407 --> 23:32.367
Lindsay is also a chaotic mess,
but, you know, that's fine

23:32.411 --> 23:34.369
because she's
my chaotic mess.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.197
Lins and I talk
all the time.

23:36.240 --> 23:39.287
She has been there for me for
so much of my Madison bullsh--.

23:39.330 --> 23:41.942
- What are you doing?
- Just being a ----ing idiot.

23:41.985 --> 23:44.814
I just had lunch with Madison,
and it's like why?

23:44.858 --> 23:46.729
I've heard a lot about
her past relationship.

23:46.773 --> 23:47.904
- I don't know, Austen.

23:47.948 --> 23:50.080
Like, he sent me
a PowerPoint presentation

23:50.124 --> 23:53.083
of his feelings and everything
and all of his thoughts and--

23:53.127 --> 23:54.563
- Whoa.

23:54.607 --> 23:56.130
And now, I'm single.

23:56.173 --> 23:57.479
Lindsay is single.

23:57.523 --> 23:59.307
I don't know what's
gonna happen, you know,

23:59.350 --> 24:02.223
between us but,
like, let's go.

24:02.266 --> 24:04.312
- Honestly, I'm just
happy to, like, reunite

24:04.355 --> 24:06.009
with you and Craig.

24:06.053 --> 24:08.185
- I know. Can't wait.
Love you.

24:08.229 --> 24:10.492
- I love you, too.

24:10.536 --> 24:12.799
- I brought way
too much stuff.

24:12.842 --> 24:14.017
- Ciara,
what do you think?

24:14.061 --> 24:15.454
- Oh, my God,
it looks so good.

24:15.497 --> 24:17.673
Where are gonna put it?
- On this.

24:17.717 --> 24:19.936
- Do I look cute?
- You look cute.

24:19.980 --> 24:22.025
You look like you know
what you're doin'.

24:22.069 --> 24:23.592
- Dinner, let's go.

24:23.636 --> 24:26.377
Dinner is pizza,
pasta, and salad,

24:26.421 --> 24:27.988
and whatever the else
you guys wanna snack on.

24:28.031 --> 24:30.120
- Nice little family dinner--
this is nice.

24:30.164 --> 24:32.688
- If you give me the balsamic
with the vinegar,

24:32.732 --> 24:33.689
that'd be great.

24:35.125 --> 24:37.519
- Kyle, why don't you sit
across from your fiance?

24:37.563 --> 24:39.956
- We can--
we have space.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.523
- Okay, sorry.

24:41.567 --> 24:44.874
- We've been
together for so long.

24:44.918 --> 24:47.137
- Wait. Who here can actually
snowboard and ski?

24:47.181 --> 24:49.531
- Austen is probably
the best snowboarder

24:49.575 --> 24:50.924
out of us two.

24:50.967 --> 24:53.535
- I would say you are
grouping yourself.

24:53.579 --> 24:55.015
- Out of two.

24:55.058 --> 24:57.234
- Jason snowboards, right?
- Yes, sir.

24:57.278 --> 24:58.975
- I love an apres ski.

24:59.019 --> 25:00.760
- It's the first time that, uh,
I'm going to ski in the States.

25:00.803 --> 25:02.239
So...
- Mmm.

25:02.283 --> 25:03.589
- But you've
skied elsewhere?

25:03.632 --> 25:04.807
- Yeah, yeah, on the Alps,
like, all the time.

25:04.851 --> 25:06.113
I used to be good.
- He used to compete.

25:06.156 --> 25:07.027
- I used to even compete
when I was a--

25:07.070 --> 25:08.637
when I was a kid.
- Oh, wow.

25:08.681 --> 25:10.117
- So, who's
going tomorrow?

25:10.160 --> 25:12.380
- Yeah, who is going
skiing tomorrow?

25:12.423 --> 25:14.034
Oh, the boys.

25:14.077 --> 25:16.253
- If the ladies are alone,
I can help and stay.

25:16.297 --> 25:19.169
You know,
I don't mind that.

25:19.213 --> 25:21.998
- We don't mind.
- We don't mind if you stay.

25:23.434 --> 25:24.697
Wait, we don't
have any parmesan.

25:24.740 --> 25:26.133
- Cheese is
my favorite food.

25:26.176 --> 25:28.265
My teacher in women
and gender studies class said,

25:28.309 --> 25:30.354
"What would you give up,
oral sex or cheese,

25:30.398 --> 25:31.878
for the rest
of your life?"

25:31.921 --> 25:32.574
And it's the best question
I've ever been asked in my--

25:32.618 --> 25:33.967
- Cheese.
- Really?

25:34.010 --> 25:35.316
- No, I'm giving
up oral sex.

25:35.359 --> 25:36.186
I'm taking cheese.
- Yeah.

25:36.230 --> 25:37.405
- Yeah. Yes, exactly.

25:37.448 --> 25:40.060
- You would give up
oral sex for cheese?

25:40.103 --> 25:41.757
- Absolutely.
- A thousand percent.

25:41.801 --> 25:43.367
- You're in the minority
'cause you're an idiot.

25:43.411 --> 25:45.500
- 'Cause I'm actually usually
just waiting for it to end,

25:45.544 --> 25:47.415
so then I can have
the real sex after.

25:47.458 --> 25:49.025
- The real sex!

25:49.069 --> 25:51.811
First of all,
I love cheese.

25:51.854 --> 25:54.117
Also, I like boobs.

25:54.161 --> 25:56.467
- I love giving oral sex more
than receiving it, almost.

25:56.511 --> 25:57.686
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
Same, dude.

25:57.730 --> 25:59.035
- Yeah, but you
can still do that.

25:59.079 --> 26:00.384
We're talking about--
- No, you can't.

26:00.428 --> 26:02.778
- Yes, I-- don't make up
the rules of my question.

26:02.822 --> 26:04.127
- Ha-ha!
- You can still give it.

26:04.171 --> 26:05.955
- Don't switch the rules
of your own question

26:05.999 --> 26:07.696
just to favor yourself.

26:07.740 --> 26:10.133
- You can still eat out a girl
as much as you want.

26:10.177 --> 26:12.353
You just can't
receive blow jobs,

26:12.396 --> 26:15.138
you ----ing
- Okay.

26:15.182 --> 26:16.792
All right, bro.
Jesus Christ.

26:16.836 --> 26:18.968
- I will eat cheese over dick
any day of the week.

26:20.666 --> 26:23.190
- Put it here, sister.
Put it here.

26:23.233 --> 26:24.670
- Speaking of cheese,
where is the parmesan?

26:24.713 --> 26:26.497
- We forgot about it.

26:26.541 --> 26:27.542
Kyle, the fact
that you're eating

26:27.586 --> 26:31.372
with that spoon
is amazing.

26:31.415 --> 26:34.767
- Wow, dude.
- Kyle, stop.

26:34.810 --> 26:38.031
- Austen, I don't even
know where my room is.

26:38.074 --> 26:39.641
A wiener.

26:39.685 --> 26:41.512
- Oh, my God.

26:43.036 --> 26:45.212
The fact that Kyle is not
getting the primary bedroom

26:45.255 --> 26:48.824
is the reason he
is as drunk as he is.

26:48.868 --> 26:50.521
If this the way
that Kyle is gonna act

26:50.565 --> 26:54.003
for the rest of the vacation,
I want nothin' to do with it.

26:54.047 --> 26:56.353
- Wait, Amanda!
I'm coming.

26:58.878 --> 27:00.183
- Coming up...

27:00.227 --> 27:01.924
- Let's talk about
the Italian.

27:01.968 --> 27:03.665
He's hot.
- He's beautiful.

27:03.709 --> 27:05.232
- Did you hook
up with him?

27:08.714 --> 27:11.542
- Wow, dude, a wiener.

27:15.198 --> 27:18.201
- Wait, Amanda!
I'm coming.

27:19.942 --> 27:21.422
- I don't need
the master bedroom.

27:21.465 --> 27:22.945
- I know you don't.

27:22.989 --> 27:25.034
- I need a room where we have
a closet and a bathroom

27:25.078 --> 27:26.601
'cause, right, it's the two
of us sharing it.

27:26.645 --> 27:27.733
- I get it.
- Hi, girls.

27:27.776 --> 27:28.995
- Hello.

27:29.038 --> 27:29.952
- I have to tap
out of that.

27:29.996 --> 27:32.172
- We are important people!

27:32.215 --> 27:33.739
- Let's talk
about the boys.

27:33.782 --> 27:36.263
Really, let's talk
about the Italian.

27:36.306 --> 27:37.481
- He's beautiful.
- He's beautiful.

27:39.962 --> 27:41.703
- I would if I was single.

27:41.747 --> 27:43.923
- We have a history of, like,
friends flirting. That's it.

27:43.966 --> 27:45.054
- I love New York.

27:45.098 --> 27:46.316
I was living full-time
in New York for,

27:46.360 --> 27:47.622
like, six years.

27:47.666 --> 27:48.754
- How long have
you known him?

27:48.797 --> 27:50.146
- Almost, like,
seven years.

27:50.190 --> 27:51.321
- Oh, wow.

27:51.365 --> 27:53.280
His accent, I'm like,
you are adorable,

27:53.323 --> 27:54.673
and I love that you wanna help,
and, like, I just--

27:54.716 --> 27:56.283
- He carried all
my boxes upstairs.

27:56.326 --> 27:57.719
- That was sweet.
I saw that.

27:57.763 --> 27:59.199
- Does he have a type?

27:59.242 --> 28:01.288
- He likes blonde.
- Italian guys like blondes.

28:01.331 --> 28:02.768
- Like, wait.
Like, how blonde?

28:02.811 --> 28:04.639
Like, me blonde?
- No, babe.

28:04.683 --> 28:06.815
I'm talking about blonde.

28:06.859 --> 28:08.730
- The boys are cleaning up
the ----ing kitchen.

28:08.774 --> 28:10.123
- Let them.

28:10.166 --> 28:10.776
- Storm the castle.
- Storm the ----ing castle.

28:10.819 --> 28:12.038
- Storm the castle.

28:12.081 --> 28:12.995
- Are we ready for dishes?

28:13.039 --> 28:14.649
- If the boys
are cleaning,

28:14.693 --> 28:17.347
the girls will set up the table
for, like, a drinking game.

28:18.784 --> 28:20.176
- Can we just play
with each other?

28:20.220 --> 28:21.830
- Yeah.
- Not-- not in that way.

28:21.874 --> 28:24.006
- Oh, hey, I'll clean that.
- Thank you.

28:25.312 --> 28:26.487
- Ready?

28:28.489 --> 28:30.578
- Kyle, is all your sh--
in the car outside?

28:30.621 --> 28:32.145
- Yeah.

28:32.188 --> 28:35.191
- Let's-- let's bring it in.
Let's take a look for you.

28:35.235 --> 28:38.499
- What is on your ass?
- Who knows?

28:38.542 --> 28:39.979
- Pasta sauce.

28:40.022 --> 28:42.024
- Oh, man, I got
this whole outfit

28:42.068 --> 28:43.417
just, like, ruined.

28:43.460 --> 28:45.636
- I'm so proud of you.
Look at you.

28:45.680 --> 28:46.986
- Oh, yeah.

28:47.029 --> 28:49.075
- This is all yours?
- We gotta get it inside.

28:49.118 --> 28:50.859
- Let's put it
in the hallway.

28:50.903 --> 28:54.210
- This is it! Yeah!

28:55.951 --> 28:57.344
I'm gonna die.
- I knew he was gonna play it
like a guitar.

28:57.387 --> 28:59.346
Why did I know he was gonna
play it like a guitar?

28:59.389 --> 29:01.522
- Someone take
him away from me.

29:01.565 --> 29:03.176
I don't want it anymore.

29:03.219 --> 29:05.091
- Hey, babe,
if you can let me know

29:05.134 --> 29:06.440
where we're sleeping,
that'd be great.

29:06.483 --> 29:08.137
- I'm not participating
in this conversation.

29:08.181 --> 29:09.312
I can't.

29:09.356 --> 29:10.836
- I love that we actually
don't even know.

29:11.924 --> 29:13.186
- We'll sleep on
the couch tonight,

29:13.229 --> 29:14.535
and we'll figure it
out tomorrow.

29:16.102 --> 29:17.930
- Will someone ----in'
shotgun a beer with me?

29:17.973 --> 29:19.801
- I will. Ready?

29:21.237 --> 29:23.370
- That's my ----ing girl.

29:23.413 --> 29:26.547
That's my girl!
Go off, Amanda.

29:26.590 --> 29:28.201
- My hole is so small.
- I'm okay with that.

29:28.244 --> 29:30.594
- My hole is so tight.
- Yeah, we know. Right?

29:30.638 --> 29:31.770
- What?
- This is good.

29:31.813 --> 29:33.249
This is fun.
- This is what I need.

29:33.293 --> 29:34.860
- Thank you, guys,
for inviting me.

29:34.903 --> 29:38.124
- All right, pajama time.

29:38.167 --> 29:41.040
- Oh, Paige, my love,
I see you down there.

29:41.083 --> 29:42.911
- Don't start something
you can't finish.

29:42.955 --> 29:44.870
- Romeo, oh, Romeo!

29:44.913 --> 29:45.958
- Amanda.

29:46.001 --> 29:47.307
- Ciara.
- No, no, no.

29:47.350 --> 29:50.397
Oh, God, Oh, God.
- I was a cheerleader. Ready?

29:50.440 --> 29:51.833
- All right, go.

29:51.877 --> 29:53.008
- If she falls on me,
I'm ----ed.

29:53.052 --> 29:56.446
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

29:59.580 --> 30:01.277
We're "Titanic."

30:02.583 --> 30:03.976
- Wow.

30:04.019 --> 30:06.413
Luke, what's
happening here?

30:06.456 --> 30:08.458
- That's the cutest.
Is that a onesie?

30:08.502 --> 30:09.895
- Bring it in.

30:09.938 --> 30:11.070
- Are we going
outside, hot tub,

30:11.113 --> 30:12.114
or are we playing
drinking games?

30:12.158 --> 30:13.812
- We'll just do flip cup.

30:13.855 --> 30:14.943
- Luke's going right here.
- All right.

30:14.987 --> 30:16.336
- You cheers up,
and then you cheers down,

30:16.379 --> 30:17.728
and then you flip.
All right, go.

30:19.382 --> 30:21.602
- No, no, no, Kyle.
Throw yours back.

30:21.645 --> 30:23.125
- Uh, excuse me.

30:23.169 --> 30:24.910
- Here, Austen,
give that to Kyle.

30:24.953 --> 30:27.651
- Yes. Go, go, go!
- Kyle, if you're playing,

30:27.695 --> 30:29.349
you have to
----in' wake up.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.613
Good job, Austen.
Come on, Kyle.

30:32.656 --> 30:33.744
- No.

30:33.788 --> 30:36.791
- Kyle, let's go.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.924
Good job.
- ----in'...

30:38.967 --> 30:40.447
- I'm not even going.
We lost.

30:40.490 --> 30:43.058
- You're passing me
drinks through a round.

30:43.102 --> 30:46.845
- Because he ----ing
didn't have a cup.

30:46.888 --> 30:48.803
- Cup-a.
- He didn't have a cup!

30:48.847 --> 30:50.283
- Cup-a.
- No.

30:50.326 --> 30:52.938
----ing get your guy
together, bro.

30:52.981 --> 30:56.811
- We're on the same team.
- Bitches be lame.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.682
Amanda, come here.
Come back.

31:09.911 --> 31:12.783
- All right,
you ----er.

31:29.888 --> 31:32.891
- What's wrong with us?
I got toes.

31:36.068 --> 31:38.461
- Hey, baby.
- What's up?

31:38.505 --> 31:40.507
- Are you sleeping?
- I'm about to go to bed.

31:40.550 --> 31:42.465
- Oh, did you
have fun tonight?

31:42.509 --> 31:44.946
- No, I didn't-- I didn't
go out or do anything.

31:44.990 --> 31:46.905
I'm going to
Park City tomorrow.

31:46.948 --> 31:48.863
- I miss you.
- I miss you, too.

31:55.130 --> 31:57.089
- Bye, friend.

32:32.776 --> 32:34.430
- Coming up...

32:34.474 --> 32:36.563
- What sex act
are you best at?

32:36.606 --> 32:38.086
- Licking your P.

32:38.130 --> 32:42.003
U-S-S-Y.
- U-S-S-Y.

32:42.047 --> 32:43.831
- It got 30 degrees hotter.

32:45.311 --> 32:48.879
♪ Unh you know
what it is

32:48.923 --> 32:49.706
♪ let's get it

32:51.404 --> 32:52.753
♪ Let's get it
let's go ♪

32:52.796 --> 32:55.016
♪ let's get it let's go
let's get it let's go ♪

32:55.060 --> 32:59.542
♪ let's get it
let's go ♪

33:00.717 --> 33:04.156
- I love it.
It's so therapeutic.

33:04.199 --> 33:05.113
- And when you're
in New York City,

33:05.157 --> 33:06.332
you must make it
therapeutic.

33:06.375 --> 33:08.029
- You have to 'cause
you don't a choice.

33:08.073 --> 33:09.378
You'll lose your sh--.
- Amen.

33:09.422 --> 33:11.163
So, have you done a count
of the bathrooms here?

33:11.206 --> 33:12.686
- Well, I just know
there's, like, not

33:12.729 --> 33:15.167
a bathroom I can really go
to, like, if I have to poop.

33:15.210 --> 33:16.342
By the time I go
to the basement,

33:16.385 --> 33:18.344
I'm stopped up.

33:18.387 --> 33:20.563
- Kyle?
- Yeah.

33:20.607 --> 33:21.738
- We're gonna move
in downstairs,

33:21.782 --> 33:23.653
and Lindsay and Julia
will just have to

33:23.697 --> 33:25.612
pass through and share
a bathroom with us.

33:25.655 --> 33:28.180
I'm gonna take that rack,
so I can hang stuff up

33:28.223 --> 33:31.618
that's in there
and then call it a day.

33:31.661 --> 33:33.054
- Is there
a closet, though?

33:33.098 --> 33:34.186
- I don't know,
but we'll figure it out.

33:34.229 --> 33:35.187
It doesn't matter.

33:36.927 --> 33:38.407
- What the ----in' [BLEEP]?

33:40.235 --> 33:42.498
- Mmm.

33:42.542 --> 33:45.240
- I'm gonna have to sleep
with, like, earplugs

33:45.284 --> 33:46.589
and a facemask like my mom.
- Babe,

33:46.633 --> 33:48.896
the whole house is like that.
You're fine.

33:48.939 --> 33:50.332
- This is going to be

33:50.376 --> 33:51.507
the loudest bedroom
in the house.

33:51.551 --> 33:53.422
It's literally underneath
the living room.

33:56.121 --> 33:57.992
Am I pissed that
Amanda didn't stick up

33:58.036 --> 33:59.689
for the obvious?
Of course.

33:59.733 --> 34:01.126
- We're literally just
sleeping in here,

34:01.169 --> 34:02.170
and we're drinking.

34:02.214 --> 34:03.215
You're gonna pass out
no matter.

34:03.258 --> 34:04.564
You slept on
the ----ing couch,

34:04.607 --> 34:08.089
and you didn't need
earplugs or an eye mask.

34:08.133 --> 34:09.395
- I actually slept
on the floor.

34:11.484 --> 34:14.008
Despite sleeping
all over the house last night

34:14.052 --> 34:16.228
to try to not
claim a spot,

34:16.271 --> 34:19.318
this is the room that
we're now stuck with.

34:19.361 --> 34:22.277
So, you want me
to unpack, huh?

34:23.583 --> 34:26.412
- I feel bad for Amanda
because I don't want her

34:26.455 --> 34:28.892
to feel like she's,
like, missing out, like,

34:28.936 --> 34:30.851
on, like, the fun
that we're having.
- Yeah.

34:30.894 --> 34:33.419
- And, like, who wants to act
like an old married couple

34:33.462 --> 34:34.898
before, like,
they're even married?

34:34.942 --> 34:36.813
Like, she didn't even
look for him last night,

34:36.857 --> 34:38.206
but he didn't look
for her either.

34:38.250 --> 34:39.468
- He didn't look
for her either.

34:39.512 --> 34:40.643
- Kyle.
- All right.

34:40.687 --> 34:43.124
Yeah, I'm done.
I'm done, I'm over it.

34:43.168 --> 34:44.952
- Damn it.

34:44.995 --> 34:46.345
This is so dirty.

34:46.388 --> 34:47.955
- Are you into Austen?

34:47.998 --> 34:49.522
- He's cute, and, like,

34:49.565 --> 34:51.350
I think he's
----ing hilarious.

34:51.393 --> 34:52.699
- He is very funny.
Yeah.

34:52.742 --> 34:54.353
- I feel like guys that
get me with their humor,

34:54.396 --> 34:55.658
it's just, like,

34:55.702 --> 34:57.182
like, it's a good time always.
- Yeah.

34:57.225 --> 34:59.358
- Who is whistling?

34:59.401 --> 35:02.056
Oh, my God.
- Wow.

35:03.492 --> 35:06.060
- I love bringing coffee
to women in bed.

35:06.104 --> 35:07.975
- Oh, my God,
this is so sweet.

35:08.018 --> 35:10.151
- Women are the most beautiful
creature in this world,

35:10.195 --> 35:12.632
and it's nice to please them
and to make them happy.

35:12.675 --> 35:14.242
- Oh, my gosh.
- ...'cause it's really hot.

35:14.286 --> 35:16.636
- Thank you so much.
- Wow, you're so nice.

35:16.679 --> 35:18.420
- All my housemates
are beautiful.

35:18.464 --> 35:20.335
I gotta say that
I'm really lucky.

35:20.379 --> 35:21.467
I feel blessed.

35:21.510 --> 35:22.511
How did you guys sleep?

35:22.555 --> 35:23.991
- We passed
the out.

35:24.034 --> 35:25.123
- Yeah.

35:25.166 --> 35:26.385
- And now, we're
hung over as sh--.

35:26.428 --> 35:28.343
- Yeah, but you know what?
Take your time.

35:28.387 --> 35:30.519
- Yeah, we have to gossip
about all of you first,

35:30.563 --> 35:31.825
and then we'll be down.

35:31.868 --> 35:33.479
- Oh, yeah, you're right.

35:33.522 --> 35:34.871
- Thank you, so much,
Andrea.

35:34.915 --> 35:36.656
We really appreciate it.
- Yeah, thank you so much.

35:36.699 --> 35:38.484
- Bye.

35:38.527 --> 35:41.400
- Wrapped around.

35:41.443 --> 35:42.488
- That was very sweet.

35:42.531 --> 35:43.663
Is this a move,
or is this--?

35:43.706 --> 35:45.404
- It's definitely a move.

35:50.322 --> 35:52.280
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

35:52.324 --> 35:53.542
- I miss you.

35:53.586 --> 35:56.719
- Good morning.

35:56.763 --> 35:59.200
- We need to figure out
who wants to go skiing today.

35:59.244 --> 36:00.854
- Yeah.
- 'Cause I will rally.

36:00.897 --> 36:01.985
- I'm good.

36:02.029 --> 36:03.291
- I know that Craig
said he wants to.

36:03.335 --> 36:04.510
- All right.

36:04.553 --> 36:06.512
Ladies, anybody
wanna go skiing?

36:06.555 --> 36:08.078
- Absolutely not.

36:08.122 --> 36:09.297
Maybe, like, next year.

36:09.341 --> 36:10.516
- Huh.

36:10.559 --> 36:11.952
- What are you lookin'
to do here today?

36:11.995 --> 36:13.127
- I have no ----in' idea.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.520
- Y'all gonna be loose
when we get back?

36:14.563 --> 36:16.043
Y'all should open up,
like, champagne and just--

36:16.086 --> 36:17.349
- Oh, my God.

36:17.392 --> 36:18.524
You said, "Are we
gonna be loose,

36:18.567 --> 36:20.265
and we should open up."
I was like--

36:20.308 --> 36:22.702
- Ha. I-I need you
to open up more.

36:22.745 --> 36:24.269
- Hmm.

36:24.312 --> 36:27.750
- Um, I feel like we need
to have, like, a spring break.

36:27.794 --> 36:30.100
- Party.
- It's a theme party.

36:30.144 --> 36:32.451
- I love that.
- Perfect, okay.

36:32.494 --> 36:34.540
- So, I'm gonna have
my coffee, and then, um,

36:34.583 --> 36:36.019
Paige, Ciara,
I'm actually gonna still

36:36.063 --> 36:37.760
poop in your bathroom
'cause I don't have one.

36:37.804 --> 36:38.979
- Downstairs.
- Or you can--

36:39.022 --> 36:40.285
- I'm gonna make
that a morning ritual.

36:40.328 --> 36:43.113
- Kyle, downstairs.

36:53.820 --> 36:55.909
- Whoo-hoo-hoo.

36:55.952 --> 36:57.563
Dude, just call me
the quad father.

36:57.606 --> 36:58.781
Look at that.

37:01.001 --> 37:03.046
Ow,

37:03.090 --> 37:04.396
- All right.
Let's rock and roll.

37:07.442 --> 37:09.749
- We're here.
Ooh, buddy.

37:12.142 --> 37:14.101
- Oh, come on.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.278
- All right, boys.

37:19.541 --> 37:20.803
- Whoo!

37:26.156 --> 37:27.810
- Yeah, buddy.

37:29.029 --> 37:30.291
Growing up in Minnesota,

37:30.335 --> 37:31.727
we played a lot of hockey,
so I didn't get to

37:31.771 --> 37:34.034
actually go
snowboarding a lot,

37:34.077 --> 37:35.296
but being an athlete,

37:35.340 --> 37:37.820
my snowboarding skills
are advanced.

37:40.170 --> 37:42.042
Ahh.
Whoa, buddy!

37:43.478 --> 37:45.393
- I brought
Prosecco pong.

37:45.437 --> 37:47.395
Maybe we set that up.

37:47.439 --> 37:49.484
- Oh!

37:49.528 --> 37:50.790
- How did that happen?
- I don't know.

37:50.833 --> 37:51.965
- I did it so dainty.

37:52.008 --> 37:53.140
- I don't know.
- I mean...

37:53.183 --> 37:54.228
- I just get wet when
you're around me.

37:54.272 --> 37:55.882
I don't know
what happened.

37:55.925 --> 37:57.318
Should we go to
the big room?

37:57.362 --> 37:58.711
- Yeah.

37:58.754 --> 38:00.452
- Oh, my God, now I look
like I peed myself.

38:00.495 --> 38:02.628
- I never played.
- You've never played beer pong?

38:02.671 --> 38:04.194
- You're about
to pop his cherry.

38:06.109 --> 38:07.459
- Oh!
- Oh!

38:07.502 --> 38:08.634
She throws balls
'til she falls.

38:08.677 --> 38:10.070
- There she is.

38:11.071 --> 38:12.028
- Yes!
- Wait.

38:12.072 --> 38:13.073
How do you say her name?

38:13.116 --> 38:14.466
- Ciara, Ciara.

38:14.509 --> 38:16.729
- I love that.

38:16.772 --> 38:18.861
- Amanda.
- Amanda.

38:18.905 --> 38:20.341
After this game,
we play a different game.

38:20.385 --> 38:21.821
- Yeah!

38:21.864 --> 38:23.170
- I did it.

38:23.213 --> 38:25.259
- I told you we have
our secret weapon.

38:25.303 --> 38:26.652
- Secret weapon.

38:26.695 --> 38:28.610
- Okay, we're gonna play
truth or dare.

38:28.654 --> 38:29.655
- Ooh, this
could get good.

38:29.698 --> 38:31.178
Let me open up my drink.
Okay.

38:33.963 --> 38:35.225
- If that's how
you wanna do it.

38:35.269 --> 38:36.836
- Hardcore.

38:36.879 --> 38:39.055
How many people in the room
would you be willing to kiss?

38:39.099 --> 38:40.361
That's a easy one.

38:40.405 --> 38:41.667
- All of 'em.

38:41.710 --> 38:42.972
- Next question.

38:43.016 --> 38:45.410
So, Gabby, what's
the shortest amount of time

38:45.453 --> 38:48.500
you've known someone
before ----in' 'em?

38:48.543 --> 38:49.849
- 24 hours.

38:49.892 --> 38:51.154
- That's a long time.

38:52.721 --> 38:54.114
- I love that.

38:54.157 --> 38:56.986
- Now, I'm like, wow,
I respect her so much more.

38:57.030 --> 38:59.511
Gabby is beautiful,
but the way she carries herself

38:59.554 --> 39:01.774
is unique and honest.

39:01.817 --> 39:03.689
Like, she's not
holding anything back.

39:03.732 --> 39:05.386
The more I genuinely
get to know her,

39:05.430 --> 39:07.562
the more I like.

39:08.433 --> 39:10.435
- Yeah, buddy.
I am exhausted.

39:10.478 --> 39:11.523
- When I woke up
this morning, I was like

39:11.566 --> 39:12.524
there is just
absolutely no way

39:12.567 --> 39:13.742
I'm gonna make it
to the mountain.

39:13.786 --> 39:15.004
- I actually thought that, too.
- Really?

39:15.048 --> 39:16.136
- I'm Kevin.
I'll help you guys out today.

39:16.179 --> 39:17.267
- Thanks for having us.

39:17.311 --> 39:18.399
- Do you want anything
else to drink?

39:18.443 --> 39:19.226
- I'm gonna get
a Bud Light, please.

39:19.269 --> 39:20.009
- Sure.
- I'm gonna do

39:20.053 --> 39:21.359
a with salt.

39:21.402 --> 39:22.403
- With salt, you got it.

39:22.447 --> 39:23.709
- And the PBR.
- Sure.

39:23.752 --> 39:25.493
- Dude, wow, the old
casual double fist.

39:25.537 --> 39:27.277
- Boys.
I'll do the bloody Mary.

39:27.321 --> 39:28.366
- Sure.

39:28.409 --> 39:30.019
- I'm gonna eat some food.

39:30.063 --> 39:31.673
- Kyle, what is the last thing
that you remember last night?

39:31.717 --> 39:33.153
Because you were
shot out of a cannon.

39:33.196 --> 39:35.155
- I had a lot of pent up,
uh, excitement.

39:35.198 --> 39:36.417
- Right, right.

39:36.461 --> 39:37.940
Obviously, what, like,
kinda pushed it was

39:37.984 --> 39:39.246
the room situation did
not go in your favor.

39:39.289 --> 39:40.682
- Yeah, yeah.

39:40.726 --> 39:42.162
- So, I did not realize that
I was gonna have to sit

39:42.205 --> 39:43.555
and, like, explain
myself to people.

39:44.817 --> 39:46.253
I'm like, Amanda,
it would have been great.

39:46.296 --> 39:47.820
All-- because I feel
like all-all she--

39:47.863 --> 39:49.125
- I think she should
have voiced it, too.

39:49.169 --> 39:50.213
- I thought Amanda was
gonna take care of it

39:50.257 --> 39:51.606
'cause she's, like,
the third one.

39:51.650 --> 39:52.999
- All she needed to do,
was say, "Paige, Ciara,

39:53.042 --> 39:53.782
like, look, love you, girls,
but, like, come on."

39:53.826 --> 39:55.088
But she kinda was
in the corner,

39:55.131 --> 39:57.090
and I just was,
like, taking shots.

40:00.354 --> 40:02.443
- What sex act
are you best at?

40:02.487 --> 40:04.314
- Your favorite.
- Like, your favorite?

40:04.358 --> 40:08.231
- Licking your
P. Poom S-S-Y.

40:08.275 --> 40:09.929
- Poom S-S-Y.

40:09.972 --> 40:11.844
- I'm, like, I can't
spell it, or I am ----ing--

40:11.887 --> 40:13.280
- Yeah, in my head, I was like
that's not attractive.

40:13.323 --> 40:15.456
- So, you're a lovely
fellatio giver.

40:15.500 --> 40:16.631
- You got it.

40:16.675 --> 40:18.764
- It got 30 degrees hotter.

40:18.807 --> 40:21.288
- Shout out to Ciara.
It's your turn, Ciara.

40:21.331 --> 40:22.463
- Ciara, it's your turn.

40:22.507 --> 40:23.595
- Yeah.

40:23.638 --> 40:25.031
- Do you think you're
a good kisser?

40:25.988 --> 40:28.643
- Listen, I should do it,
and you should tell me

40:28.687 --> 40:30.471
because everywhere
in the world,

40:30.515 --> 40:31.646
they kiss differently.

40:31.690 --> 40:33.474
So, I try to adapt
myself wherever.

40:33.518 --> 40:34.823
- Like, what's
an Italian kiss?

40:34.867 --> 40:36.172
- A little bit of tongue.

40:36.216 --> 40:37.957
- A little bit of tongue.
What's an American kiss?

40:38.000 --> 40:40.220
- More, like, lips,
like, going--

40:40.263 --> 40:42.048
getting into each other.
Muah, muah, muah.

40:42.091 --> 40:43.571
- Yeah, okay.
- I love that.

40:43.615 --> 40:44.964
But, yeah, the thing
about me,

40:45.007 --> 40:46.618
is just I don't like
talking about myself.

40:46.661 --> 40:48.489
- Yeah, no, none of us do.

40:48.533 --> 40:50.491
- No, I feel
like Paige does.

40:51.927 --> 40:54.669
That's just, like,
uh, an impression.

40:57.977 --> 40:59.935
She's the queen
of the school.

41:01.850 --> 41:03.373
- Coming up...

41:03.417 --> 41:04.984
- Are you ----ing
kidding me?

41:05.027 --> 41:06.420
That's my ex.
- Is it?

41:06.464 --> 41:07.900
- Yes.

41:07.943 --> 41:09.858
I hope we all get drunk tonight
and make poor decisions.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.254
- The thing about me,
is just I don't like

41:14.297 --> 41:15.081
talking about myself.

41:15.124 --> 41:16.691
- Yeah, no, none of us do.

41:16.735 --> 41:18.780
- No, I feel
like Paige does.

41:20.173 --> 41:22.044
That's just, like,
uh, an impression.

41:22.088 --> 41:23.568
I don't know you,
but I feel like--

41:23.611 --> 41:24.482
it's not bad.
Like...

41:26.788 --> 41:29.008
She's the, you know,
the queen of the school.

41:29.051 --> 41:31.837
- Regina George?
- Regina George.

41:31.880 --> 41:33.882
- I am dying.
- Don't get it as an offense.

41:33.926 --> 41:35.101
- I'm-- I'm not.

41:35.144 --> 41:37.886
- But it's just a feeling.
- Cool, okay.

41:37.930 --> 41:40.193
He could literally tell me
to go to myself,

41:40.236 --> 41:42.543
and I'd be like,
"Thank you so much."

41:43.675 --> 41:44.980
He's so hot.
I have not listened

41:45.024 --> 41:47.722
to one word that's
come out of his mouth.

41:47.766 --> 41:49.550
- There's nothing bad.
I-I--

41:49.594 --> 41:51.683
I would spend hours
listening to you.

41:53.815 --> 41:55.861
- Just ----ed you up.

41:56.818 --> 41:58.951
- I am 1,000% single.

41:58.994 --> 41:59.952
- Who is tickling
your fancy, man?

41:59.995 --> 42:02.084
- Yeah, so, Ciara
is so pretty.

42:02.128 --> 42:03.738
It is, like, intimidating.

42:03.782 --> 42:05.435
You used to have a thing
with you and Ciara.

42:05.479 --> 42:07.263
- These are for you.

42:07.307 --> 42:08.569
- Did you really
get me flowers?

42:08.613 --> 42:09.831
- Yeah. Well, yeah.

42:09.875 --> 42:11.441
Um...
- That's so sweet.

42:11.485 --> 42:12.965
- Like, is she off limits?

42:14.314 --> 42:16.316
- I mean, listen, dude.
She's a grown woman.

42:16.359 --> 42:18.057
If you jive with someone,
and, like, it's happening,

42:18.100 --> 42:19.188
it happens.
Like, that's the main thing.

42:19.232 --> 42:20.668
- Sure.

42:20.712 --> 42:22.278
- I've dated some amazing women,
really amazing women.

42:23.889 --> 42:25.760
- See, if we didn't like you,
that would be--

42:25.804 --> 42:27.022
we would be like
we ----ing hate that guy.

42:27.066 --> 42:28.676
- I'd be like
this guy.

42:28.720 --> 42:30.243
- "I've dated a lot of women."
I'd be like that guy.

42:30.286 --> 42:30.939
- On your tombstone, I've dated
a lot of amazing women.

42:30.983 --> 42:32.201
- that guy.

42:32.245 --> 42:35.291
- you, you,
and you.

42:35.335 --> 42:37.467
- Wasn't Julia supposed
to show up, like, an hour ago?

42:37.511 --> 42:39.992
- She said she's coming.
She'll be here before tonight.

42:40.035 --> 42:42.516
- Let's put our snow stuff on
and go roll around.

42:42.560 --> 42:43.996
- Should we make
a snowman?

42:44.039 --> 42:46.912
- Do some snow stuff,
snowman, snow sled, sled snow.

42:46.955 --> 42:49.001
- We're goin' outside.
- Whoo.

42:50.219 --> 42:51.656
- All I wanted to do,
was get drunk

42:51.699 --> 42:52.874
and roll around in the snow.

42:52.918 --> 42:54.354
My dreams are
about to come true.

42:54.397 --> 42:56.356
Ready?

42:56.399 --> 42:58.837
- Oh!
Oh, my God.

42:58.880 --> 43:00.490
- Bank left!

43:00.534 --> 43:01.666
- Oh!

43:03.842 --> 43:05.365
- Oh, man.

43:08.237 --> 43:09.282
Thank you.

43:09.325 --> 43:11.240
- Come here,
you little snow bunny.

43:11.284 --> 43:13.503
- Oh, thank you.
- Go ahead, you got it.

43:17.551 --> 43:19.248
- Hello?

43:22.077 --> 43:23.601
Where is everyone?

43:23.644 --> 43:25.515
I hear people.

43:25.559 --> 43:27.126
- Oh, my God.

43:28.954 --> 43:30.608
- Who is knocking?

43:33.567 --> 43:36.004
- Get upstairs, now!

43:36.048 --> 43:37.527
- I'm like, how do
I get anywhere?

43:37.571 --> 43:39.791
Look how cute.

43:39.834 --> 43:41.836
Oh, my God,

43:41.880 --> 43:44.012
could we be
any more opposite, right now?

43:44.056 --> 43:45.666
Hi.
- We were playing in the snow.

43:45.710 --> 43:46.841
- Guys, I am so excited.

43:46.885 --> 43:48.582
I'm so happy you're here.

43:52.760 --> 43:54.414
Wait.

43:55.937 --> 43:57.330

43:57.373 --> 43:59.724

Whoopsies.

43:59.767 --> 44:03.031
So, I'm comin'
into the house hot.

44:03.075 --> 44:04.337
Paige and I modeled together

44:04.380 --> 44:05.860
when we were, like,
ten years old

44:05.904 --> 44:07.906
on the set of
Limited Too.

44:07.949 --> 44:09.298
We've become friends
through that,

44:09.342 --> 44:11.170
and the rest
is history.

44:11.213 --> 44:12.737
Now, I'm ready
to ----in' party.

44:12.780 --> 44:14.216
I'm so excited.

44:14.260 --> 44:15.522
Let's go.

44:15.565 --> 44:17.263
Why did I just do that,
like I'm Hulk Hogan?

44:18.917 --> 44:20.788
- To Julia being here,
our missing link.

44:20.832 --> 44:23.008
- Cheers.

to wearing winter clothes

45:54.708 --> 45:56.362
'cause this is not cool.

45:56.405 --> 45:58.233
- I just wanted to make sure
you're okay in your room.

45:58.277 --> 45:59.713
- I was looking through
my stuff,

45:59.757 --> 46:00.845
and then I kinda gave up

46:00.888 --> 46:02.498
because I don't wanna
unpack anything.

46:02.542 --> 46:03.978
- I know.

46:04.022 --> 46:05.327
- Do you know when
she gets here?

your boyfriend?

- Good.

46:13.553 --> 46:14.597
- I'm gonna miss him,
I think, these two weeks,

46:14.641 --> 46:15.816
but I feel like
I'll be distracted

46:15.860 --> 46:17.035
and have fun.
- Yeah.

46:17.078 --> 46:18.123
- And, like, I'm so excited
to be here.

46:18.166 --> 46:19.472
- Absence makes the heart
go fonder.

46:19.515 --> 46:20.690
You're gonna get home
and be like, ahh.

46:20.734 --> 46:23.258
- Is there any initial
sexual attraction?

46:23.302 --> 46:24.999
- I think Andrea
is obviously gorgeous.

46:25.043 --> 46:26.044
- Yeah.

46:26.087 --> 46:27.393
- I'd like to send
a thank you note

46:27.436 --> 46:28.524
to his parents.
- God bless his parents. Yes.

46:28.568 --> 46:29.482
- Thank you for giving--
- Chef's kiss.

46:29.525 --> 46:30.570
- Yeah, literally.

46:33.138 --> 46:34.530
- Shopping for a village,

46:34.574 --> 46:36.489
- This small village
is gonna be eatin' good.

46:36.532 --> 46:38.534
- I swear to God,
if they tell us we forgot

46:38.578 --> 46:42.451
one ----in' thing,
I'm gonna lose it.

46:42.495 --> 46:44.366
Are you ----in'
kidding me?

46:46.629 --> 46:48.196
That's my ex.

46:48.240 --> 46:49.502
- Is it?
- Yes.

46:49.545 --> 46:51.591
You gotta be kidding me.

46:51.634 --> 46:54.637
- You're famous,
or your ex-girlfriend is.

46:54.681 --> 46:56.726
- So, this old, old
baseball douche

46:56.770 --> 46:58.685
was DMing Madison.
So what?

46:58.728 --> 47:00.948
- Are you doin' all right?
- I'm in Vermont.

47:00.992 --> 47:02.297
Couldn't be further away
from, like,

47:02.341 --> 47:06.258
my Charleston bullsh--.
Why do I gotta see this?

47:06.301 --> 47:08.390
I don't want to see
her face,

47:08.434 --> 47:11.176
and now she is looking at me
with that dumb little smirk

47:11.219 --> 47:14.135
on the front of a magazine.
Aye-aye-aye.

47:14.179 --> 47:15.397
What the [BLEEP]?

47:15.441 --> 47:16.834
- Do I need to take
your phone away?

47:16.877 --> 47:17.922
- You know what?

47:17.965 --> 47:19.445
That's, like,
not the worst idea.

47:19.488 --> 47:21.664
I hope we all get drunk tonight
and make poor decisions.

47:23.057 --> 47:23.928
- Coming up...

47:26.104 --> 47:28.236
- What the ----in'
sh-- is this?

47:28.280 --> 47:29.585
- Go.
Get outta here.

47:29.629 --> 47:32.458
- I cannot even tell you
what I just walked in on.

47:34.503 --> 47:36.462
♪ Yeah yeah yeah
either you get lit now ♪

47:36.505 --> 47:38.159
♪ or you're gonna
sit down ♪

47:38.203 --> 47:40.161
- Look at you guys.

47:40.205 --> 47:42.642
Looks like spring break.

47:42.685 --> 47:43.469
- Kids.

47:43.512 --> 47:44.774
- Hi.

47:44.818 --> 47:46.864
- Dude, this is great.
They did an awesome job.

47:50.563 --> 47:53.131
Except me.

47:53.174 --> 47:54.523
- Guess what I just saw
on the newsstand

47:54.567 --> 47:57.135
in the grocery store.
My ex.

47:57.178 --> 47:58.658
- What's this?

47:58.701 --> 48:00.965
- He saw his ex on the tabloids
at the grocery store.

48:01.008 --> 48:02.705
- Oh, no.
- Wow.

48:02.749 --> 48:04.925
- His phone is restricted
for the night.

48:04.969 --> 48:06.709
Get the phone!

48:13.151 --> 48:14.935
- Should I wear this?

48:14.979 --> 48:17.372
I love your honesty.

48:22.987 --> 48:25.641
- I don't know, I didn't
ask her for a play-by-play.

48:25.685 --> 48:28.079
- Jason, come and see
how good I look.

48:28.122 --> 48:29.907
- Ooh.
- Hmm?

48:29.950 --> 48:31.604
- I don't even have to
change my underwear.

48:32.605 --> 48:35.086
- This is
definitely a look.

48:35.129 --> 48:37.566
- Is this spring break?

48:37.610 --> 48:39.003
- It is now.

48:39.046 --> 48:40.221
- We're here
for the party.

48:40.265 --> 48:42.441
- Where's the party?

48:42.484 --> 48:44.617
- Who's ready
to ----in' party?

48:47.620 --> 48:49.970
- All right.
Cheers, everybody.

48:50.014 --> 48:52.233
Spring break!

48:52.277 --> 48:54.192
- Spring break
has officially started.

48:57.586 --> 48:59.849
- For the boys!
Let's get super fratty.

48:59.893 --> 49:02.069
I wanna see everybody's
drinks in a red Solo.

49:02.113 --> 49:03.984
- I'm gonna get
the beer funnel.

49:04.028 --> 49:05.812
- Ooh, I wanna do it.
- Yeah, let's do it.

49:05.855 --> 49:07.292
- This makes me so happy.

49:07.335 --> 49:12.732
Whoo!
Spring break '21!

49:12.775 --> 49:14.081
- Damn.

49:14.125 --> 49:15.648
----ing champ.

49:15.691 --> 49:17.911
- You've earned
your stripes.

49:17.955 --> 49:20.827
- Are we ready?

49:20.870 --> 49:22.698
- Send it to the moon!

49:26.224 --> 49:27.834
- I wanna get "leid",
Austen.

49:27.877 --> 49:29.314
- Amanda.
- Thank you.

49:29.357 --> 49:30.315
- Is that the first time
you've been "leid" this trip?

49:37.670 --> 49:39.454
- Whoo!

49:48.289 --> 49:50.074
- Slap it-- Oh!

49:53.468 --> 49:54.643
- I don't--
I'm not doing it though.

49:54.687 --> 49:56.080
- Drink it.
- I can't.

50:04.523 --> 50:06.438
- Take this.
Come over here.

50:06.481 --> 50:07.613
You gotta try to
hit the pinata.

50:07.656 --> 50:10.268
Go ahead. Hit it.
Hit it! Hit it!

50:10.311 --> 50:12.879
Hit it!

50:12.922 --> 50:16.535
You gotta hit it.

50:16.578 --> 50:19.625
Oh!

50:19.668 --> 50:21.235
- Hey, boys,
check me out.

50:23.759 --> 50:27.198
- Show us you're better
than an ex-MLB player.

50:27.241 --> 50:29.156
Hit it out of the park!

50:29.200 --> 50:30.201
- You weren't even
an all-star.

50:30.244 --> 50:32.333
Oh, wait.

50:32.377 --> 50:33.639
- There's this tether

50:33.682 --> 50:36.294
that's holds him to
Charleston and his ex.

50:36.337 --> 50:38.861
I hope this vacation
slices that tether

50:38.905 --> 50:40.124
and sets him free.

50:40.167 --> 50:42.039
We've got girls dancing
around in bikinis.

50:42.082 --> 50:43.866
There's pinatas,
Jell-O shots.

50:43.910 --> 50:45.999
If you can't get over your ex
in this environment,

50:46.043 --> 50:47.348
then that's on you.

50:48.175 --> 50:51.004
- you!

50:55.878 --> 50:59.752
- Dude,
just go talk to Ciara.

50:59.795 --> 51:01.101
- Okay, let me lei you,
please.

51:01.145 --> 51:03.495
- You wanna get "leid?"
- Never more in my life.

51:03.538 --> 51:04.496
- Do you wanna get "leid"
by me?

51:04.539 --> 51:06.759
- Sure.
- Okay.

51:06.802 --> 51:08.674
- And one more time
in the morning.

51:08.717 --> 51:10.458
- Oh. We can do like a mid-day,
- Now, I'm--

51:10.502 --> 51:12.025
- ...and a nighttime,
and a morning.

51:12.069 --> 51:13.809
- And you'll get taken care of
in all of those.

51:13.853 --> 51:15.507
- Yeah.

51:15.550 --> 51:17.204
- Why don't you
get on my shoulder?

51:17.248 --> 51:18.597
- For what?

51:18.640 --> 51:20.512
- Just for fun. Yeah.
- For fun?

51:20.555 --> 51:22.340
- Oh, my gosh,
look at that bikini

51:22.383 --> 51:25.169
and look at those boots.

51:25.212 --> 51:26.648
Whoo!

51:27.562 --> 51:28.737
- I see your butthole.

51:28.781 --> 51:30.609
- Come on.
Be a ----in' gentleman.

51:30.652 --> 51:32.219
Lift her up.
- All right, You ready?

51:32.263 --> 51:35.744
- And let's ----ing do it!

51:35.788 --> 51:38.356
- Ready?

51:38.399 --> 51:40.358
Wow.
- Go. Go, go, go.

51:40.401 --> 51:42.403
- All right.
- Let's go.

51:42.447 --> 51:44.492
- Actually, Jason,
can you help me down?

51:44.536 --> 51:46.407
- No, not on the hardwood.
- Oh, God.

51:49.018 --> 51:50.019
- Oh, I'm so sweaty.

51:50.063 --> 51:52.674
I'm really sorry.
I sweat all over.

52:14.957 --> 52:16.394
- Wait. Did he just say,
"My girl?"

52:16.437 --> 52:19.353
- Yeah.
Let's go in the hot tub.

52:19.397 --> 52:20.833
- Let's go!

52:20.876 --> 52:23.096
- Whoo-hoo!
- Let's go.

52:23.140 --> 52:25.925
- Oh! I thought I was
stronger than this.

52:28.362 --> 52:29.624
- Who wants tequila?

52:29.668 --> 52:31.148
- I'll have tequila.

52:32.410 --> 52:35.761
- Let's go.
We're frat boys!

52:35.804 --> 52:37.458
- Whoo!

52:40.722 --> 52:42.376
- What happened?
- Hey, guys, what time is it?

52:42.420 --> 52:45.814
- 9:30.
- Kyle, hey.

52:45.858 --> 52:47.860
- And then there were
me and Paige.

52:47.903 --> 52:50.167
- Now, you guys
are gonna get married.

52:51.994 --> 52:53.300
- You guys go
to your corner.

52:53.344 --> 52:55.302
- You're in my corner.
I've been here all night.

52:55.346 --> 52:56.912
- Mine?
- Now, take her that way.

52:56.956 --> 52:59.393
- You know how to speak
collectively, like "our."

52:59.437 --> 53:00.873
- Guys, do we wanna do
a shot?

53:00.916 --> 53:02.527
I don't know
where the vodka is.

53:02.570 --> 53:03.876
- It's downstairs outside.

53:03.919 --> 53:05.834
- Kyle, can you go get
the other thing of vodka

53:05.878 --> 53:07.053
downstairs?

53:09.925 --> 53:12.058
- Oh, my God, cuties.
- Stop.

53:24.679 --> 53:26.246
- What the ----in' sh--
is this?

53:26.290 --> 53:27.552
- Oh, my gosh.

53:27.595 --> 53:30.250
- I'm walking into, like,
a full-blown orgy.

53:30.294 --> 53:31.686
[BLEEP], man,

53:31.730 --> 53:34.167
I wish I didn't see that
'cause that's awesome.

53:34.211 --> 53:35.647
- Go! Get outta here.

53:35.690 --> 53:37.475
- Yeah, we're just talking.
- We were talking.

53:37.518 --> 53:38.476
- I'm only coming down here
for this.

53:40.869 --> 53:42.349
I remember making out
in hot tubs.

53:42.393 --> 53:45.265
Oh, my God,
those were the days.

53:45.309 --> 53:46.223
Ah!

53:48.964 --> 53:52.185
I cannot even tell you
what I just walked in on.

53:52.229 --> 53:53.752
They're all making out.

53:53.795 --> 53:55.319
- That's exactly
what you would think

53:55.362 --> 53:57.190
you would walk out to, Kyle.
What are you talking about?
