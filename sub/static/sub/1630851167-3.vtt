00:34.659 --> 00:36.703
Ah, Doctor, sorry to interrupt.

00:36.786 --> 00:38.455
Uh… what are you working on?

00:38.538 --> 00:41.750
Oh, uh, I'm journaling. [exhales]

00:43.877 --> 00:48.089
I've been looking for something
to fulfill me, and I've found this works.

00:52.427 --> 00:55.430
Well, you should write
in your journal that you were wrong.

00:56.014 --> 00:59.059
Remember how it was your idea
to help someone I didn't care about

00:59.142 --> 01:00.226
to prove I could be God?

01:00.310 --> 01:02.353
-No.
-Well, it didn't work.

01:02.437 --> 01:06.316
Because I ended up caring for him,
so back to square one.

01:10.153 --> 01:11.404
You know…

01:13.490 --> 01:17.077
I've found the best way to get answers

01:17.160 --> 01:20.205
can be to look to the past.

01:20.789 --> 01:22.916
We met because of a case,

01:23.500 --> 01:26.127
which I'm realizing
I don't know a lot about.

01:26.836 --> 01:29.130
Those details might be enlightening.

01:30.215 --> 01:31.049
For you.

01:31.674 --> 01:32.509
Of course.

01:35.428 --> 01:38.223
Okay. Well, a…

01:39.599 --> 01:42.310
friend of mine had been murdered,
someone I cared about quite a bit.

01:42.393 --> 01:44.938
Delilah, right? The singer?

01:45.855 --> 01:48.316
-She was a patient of mine.
-That's right.

01:48.399 --> 01:51.486
That's right. It was
the first time that Chloe and I met.

01:51.569 --> 01:53.488
We caught the killer… [scoffs]

01:53.571 --> 01:56.491
…a record producer who
was trying to profit from Delilah's death.

01:56.574 --> 01:57.408
Tell me about him.

01:57.492 --> 02:02.163
Oh, well,
he was a vile, horrid little man.

02:02.247 --> 02:05.083
He was the worst.

02:08.378 --> 02:09.212
He's perfect.

02:10.547 --> 02:11.548
Perfect for what?

02:11.631 --> 02:14.551
Well, I don't want to fall into the trap
of caring about someone again,

02:14.634 --> 02:17.720
so who better to help than someone I hate?

02:17.804 --> 02:19.222
Oh, Doctor, you're a genius.

02:19.806 --> 02:22.267
This totally makes up
for your earlier bad advice.

02:23.309 --> 02:24.477
What-- what was his name?

02:24.561 --> 02:28.273
Why was he horrid? Do you remember
anything else about the case?

02:47.083 --> 02:48.877
[sighs] Good point.

02:48.960 --> 02:53.840
How far do you think
a frog could fall and live?

02:53.923 --> 02:57.302
Sounds like a fun experiment…
for us, less the frog. [chuckles]

02:57.385 --> 02:59.220
You're welcome
to use my penthouse if you wish.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.556
-I'm not gonna do that, Lucifer.
-Oh.

03:01.639 --> 03:05.560
[exhales] So is this amphibious fellow
your latest suspect?

03:06.144 --> 03:08.730
I think this frog
is something else entirely.

03:08.813 --> 03:10.148
Oh?

03:10.732 --> 03:14.277
I think it could be tied to something big.

03:15.570 --> 03:17.197
Really big.

03:17.780 --> 03:21.993
Something mind, body,

03:22.076 --> 03:24.537
and soul-altering.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.414
[croaking continues]

03:31.211 --> 03:33.421
But I'm not ready to reveal it just yet

03:33.504 --> 03:36.549
because I think it might
make me sound a bit kooks.

-Unless you really wanna know--
-I-- I respect your privacy, Miss Lopez.

03:42.972 --> 03:45.767
Besides, I'm working
on something very important myself.

03:45.850 --> 03:47.685
-And I need your help.
-Oh, sure.

03:47.769 --> 03:51.898
I'm looking for a criminal who, uh,
should still be in the police system.

03:51.981 --> 03:55.401
Oh, I can look him up for you.
What's their name?

03:55.485 --> 03:57.111
Jimmy Barnes.

03:57.195 --> 04:00.490
Last I heard,
he's in some sort of insane asylum.

04:00.573 --> 04:03.618
Kind of my bad,
but trust me, he had it coming.

04:03.701 --> 04:06.079
Oh, well, I found him, but…

04:06.871 --> 04:08.998
Well, see for yourself.

-[elevator bell dings]
-[sighs]

04:18.258 --> 04:20.635
Hey, Lucifer, you know,
I was thinking, uh…

04:22.095 --> 04:25.682
maybe it's best if I put
Amenadiel's necklace back in the…

04:27.433 --> 04:28.685
in the safe.

04:29.560 --> 04:32.563
-Are you going somewhere?
-I am indeed. Now which do you prefer?

04:32.647 --> 04:37.068
The iconic white or pomegranate
for more of an "original sin" vibe?

04:37.860 --> 04:39.529
[hesitates] Uh…

04:39.612 --> 04:41.656
-The white?
-That's what I was thinking.

04:41.739 --> 04:44.367
An occasion like this
requires the classic look.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.452
Wait. W-what occasion?

04:46.536 --> 04:48.121
Well, I went to see the doctor again,

04:48.204 --> 04:52.375
and I realized if I'm going to be God,
then I need to help someone that I hate.

04:52.458 --> 04:55.920
So, I am gonna help
Jimmy Barnes, of all people.

04:56.004 --> 04:58.506
[laughs] Jimmy Barnes?

04:59.215 --> 05:01.676
The same Jimmy Barnes
who killed your friend and--

05:01.759 --> 05:04.304
and who went insane
when he saw your devil face?

05:04.387 --> 05:07.265
Throw in his rather tremendous fivehead
and you've described him to a T.

05:07.348 --> 05:10.977
Well, I hate to tell you this, but he died
a year ago in a mental hospital.

05:11.060 --> 05:11.978
Yeah, I know that too.

05:12.061 --> 05:14.230
So I'm just gonna pop down
to Hell to see him.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.773
It's almost easier this way, really.

05:15.857 --> 05:17.650
Oh, okay.

05:20.361 --> 05:21.571
So when do we leave?

05:24.157 --> 05:26.159
[laughs]

05:34.417 --> 05:37.420
No, no, no, this is a terrible idea.

05:37.503 --> 05:40.631
Worst I've heard since
some genius decided to cancel Bones.

05:40.715 --> 05:42.300
-Why?
-[Lucifer] Oh, where do I start?

05:42.383 --> 05:45.178
That show was the perfect combination
of procedure and banter--

05:45.261 --> 05:46.471
[Chloe] No, I mean, Lucifer,

05:46.554 --> 05:49.515
I'm talking about me going down to Hell.

05:49.599 --> 05:50.600
Oh.

05:51.225 --> 05:55.146
Well, first and foremost,
it's never been done.

05:55.229 --> 05:59.150
Probably because mortals can't go
down there, not when they're alive anyway.

05:59.233 --> 06:01.652
I'm not even sure
if you'd survive the trip.

06:01.736 --> 06:04.405
And, look, even if you did,

06:04.489 --> 06:06.741
the place is full of terrible dangers.

06:06.824 --> 06:08.368
It's-- it's… [sighs]

06:08.451 --> 06:09.619
Well, it's Hell.

06:10.787 --> 06:13.539
So, why don't you go home,
put your feet up?

06:13.623 --> 06:15.792
-I'll pop this back in the safe--
-No!

06:21.547 --> 06:22.632
Lucifer,

06:23.216 --> 06:26.302
this makes me incredibly strong.

06:27.053 --> 06:31.224
So, shouldn't it help me
survive a trip to Hell, you know?

06:31.307 --> 06:33.142
[Lucifer sighs] Well…

06:33.226 --> 06:34.602

but I'm not sure it's worth the risk.

This isn't your problem, Chloe.

06:40.274 --> 06:41.359
Listen to me.

06:41.442 --> 06:43.945
Jimmy Barnes shot me in the chest.

06:44.028 --> 06:45.488

06:45.571 --> 06:47.115
Oh, I remember.

06:47.198 --> 06:50.868
I hate the bastard.
I mean, he truly is perfect for this.

06:50.952 --> 06:51.994
Okay, so listen,

06:52.078 --> 06:56.249
if I'm meant to be God's consultant,
I should know everything, right?

06:59.502 --> 07:02.130
we-- we are partners, aren't we?

13:08.329 --> 13:09.914
[scoffs] Well, I hope so,

13:09.997 --> 13:13.417
'cause knowing Jimmy, it's probably
quite twisted and terrifying.

13:34.146 --> 13:36.524
-Chloe, is my chin…
-Butt-like?

I was gonna say,
"This amazing in real life."

13:39.193 --> 13:40.027
"Butt-like"?

13:40.110 --> 13:43.697
So, turning into cartoons,
this, uh, this isn't normal?

13:43.781 --> 13:45.950
[chuckles] Definitely… [blubbers]

13:46.033 --> 13:49.036
-Definitely not.
-[scoffs] You did drive Jimmy insane.

13:49.119 --> 13:52.206
Maybe that's why you had
a hard time finding the door earlier,

13:52.289 --> 13:54.792
and why this hell loop is different.

13:54.875 --> 13:58.212
-[Lucifer] Oh, no. No, this is terrible!
-Because you broke Jimmy Barnes' brain?

it won't stay that way. Right?

14:07.179 --> 14:09.181
Right. Right. [chuckling]

14:09.265 --> 14:10.558
Of course.

[gasps] Ooh-ah! This feels so weird.

14:16.564 --> 14:19.400
Wait, is this because
I have Amenadiel's necklace or--

14:19.483 --> 14:21.902
-Or, well, because I'm a cartoon?
-[grunts]

14:47.344 --> 14:49.763
Well, if you were wondering
how to help Jimmy,

14:49.847 --> 14:51.307
I think we have our answer.

14:51.390 --> 14:54.476
You broke him, and now, you can fix him.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.519
Good idea.

14:55.603 --> 14:57.062
And you know what?

14:57.146 --> 14:59.315
I think I've been here before.

15:02.860 --> 15:04.194
Aha!

15:04.278 --> 15:07.531
This is the moment
I crashed Jimmy's wedding.

15:08.282 --> 15:10.743
Right after you and I first met, in fact.

15:10.826 --> 15:13.913

who would oppose this…

15:13.996 --> 15:18.542
Oh, hello, this is my cue. Now get ready,

to get her back recently…

15:35.100 --> 15:37.811
That is quite the entrance.

15:37.895 --> 15:39.647
Is that supposed to be me?

15:39.730 --> 15:43.067
Allow me to introduce myself.

but maybe it's like you were saying.

39:44.882 --> 39:47.051
Maybe that was a good thing, as is this.

39:47.134 --> 39:50.262
Because if I can grow
to like Jimmy Barnes, of all people…

39:50.346 --> 39:52.390
Then you can grow to care about anybody.

39:52.473 --> 39:56.519
And if I can care about anyone,
then I can help anyone.

39:56.602 --> 40:00.064
[exhales] So, does this mean--

40:00.147 --> 40:01.982
I think so. [chuckles]

40:02.066 --> 40:05.903
Ironically, we're in Hell,
and finally I'm ready to be God.

40:05.986 --> 40:08.781
[laughs]

40:13.244 --> 40:14.078
Wait.

40:14.787 --> 40:15.788
Where's Daniel?

40:17.039 --> 40:18.124
[Chloe exhales]

40:28.843 --> 40:31.470
Maze, what were you thinking?

40:32.096 --> 40:35.433
-You coulda screwed everything up for me!
-Hey, from what I could tell,

40:36.058 --> 40:39.603
I am the whole reason you passed
that lame reverse-psychology test,

40:39.687 --> 40:41.439
so you're welcome.

40:41.522 --> 40:42.982
All right, listen.

40:43.065 --> 40:44.984
Her methods aren't lame, okay?

40:45.067 --> 40:47.778
She has a high trainee
dropout rate because she's actually

40:47.862 --> 40:51.490
trying to find people
who are in it for the right reasons.

40:51.574 --> 40:52.783
Yeah, whatever, bro.

40:58.456 --> 40:59.665
[sighs]

40:59.748 --> 41:01.834
Why would you think
that I couldn't handle myself?

41:03.169 --> 41:05.546
Is that really how little you think of me?

41:05.629 --> 41:07.715
Don't lay your insecurities on me.

41:08.340 --> 41:09.592
I was trying to help you.

41:09.675 --> 41:11.469
I asked you why, Mazikeen.

41:11.552 --> 41:13.095
Honestly… [scoffs]

41:13.179 --> 41:14.763
-Why do you even care?
-Because.

41:14.847 --> 41:17.183
Because what,
because you thought it would be funny?

41:17.266 --> 41:20.936
-Because you thought I would fail?
-Because I'm your friend, Amenadiel!

41:28.319 --> 41:31.655
And I'm sorry if I didn't go about it
in the most ideal way or whatever.

41:31.739 --> 41:32.990
I was just trying--

41:33.073 --> 41:33.908
Thank you.

41:36.327 --> 41:37.328
Thank you.

41:38.787 --> 41:40.498
Like I said, you're welcome.

41:42.833 --> 41:44.001
Mazikeen, I…

41:45.127 --> 41:46.128
[sighs]

41:48.005 --> 41:48.839
Listen.

41:49.381 --> 41:52.801
This is important to me.

41:54.303 --> 41:56.680
Really important, you know, so…

41:59.099 --> 41:59.934
Please just--

42:00.017 --> 42:00.935
Okay.

42:07.816 --> 42:09.860
I will… not make fun of you.

42:11.153 --> 42:12.404
I promise.

42:13.531 --> 42:15.574
-I don't believe you.
-[chuckles]

42:16.700 --> 42:17.618
You shouldn't.

42:19.203 --> 42:21.914
I checked the Silver City. He's not there.

42:22.748 --> 42:26.126
Look, don't worry. Daniel probably
got lost in one of Dromos' keggers.

42:26.210 --> 42:29.713
I shall pop back down,
and I will find him. I promise, Chloe.

42:29.797 --> 42:31.340
-[sighs]
-[elevator bell dings]

42:32.508 --> 42:33.801
Daniel.

42:33.884 --> 42:38.055
I've been looking everywhere for you.
What on earth are you doing on Earth?

42:38.138 --> 42:39.515
Lucifer, watch out!

42:41.141 --> 42:42.518
[Lucifer grunts]

42:44.478 --> 42:49.191
Finally, after all these years I've spent
hating you for what you did to me,

42:49.275 --> 42:51.694
finally I can have my revenge.

42:53.362 --> 42:54.572
Okay.

42:54.655 --> 42:57.950
I have no idea who you are, so… [chuckles]

42:58.033 --> 43:00.244
[panting]

43:00.327 --> 43:02.705
You're not one of my siblings.
Who are you?

43:03.831 --> 43:05.249
I'm your daughter!

43:11.255 --> 43:12.172
[scoffs]
