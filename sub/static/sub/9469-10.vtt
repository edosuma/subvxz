00:16.247 --> 00:17.457
Now what?

00:17.540 --> 00:18.625
I don't know.

00:22.253 --> 00:23.922
They're not gonna get any deader.

00:25.381 --> 00:26.967
Fine.

00:42.732 --> 00:45.359
Damn, we're out of bleach.

00:48.571 --> 00:49.697
Come on, Miranda.

00:49.781 --> 00:51.950
Last mile. You can do it.

01:07.007 --> 01:09.509
- Where's Nadia?
- In Roman's room.

01:09.592 --> 01:10.677
Her room is freezing.

01:12.846 --> 01:15.140
She stared at him.

01:16.016 --> 01:19.602
- Who did?
- Nadia.

01:21.938 --> 01:23.690
And then he just dropped dead.

01:23.773 --> 01:26.818
You said you whacked the
guy with a snow globe. Right?

01:28.235 --> 01:30.655
Died of a brain hemorrhage, probably.

01:35.785 --> 01:37.954
I hate you.

01:39.831 --> 01:42.458
I hate all of you.

01:42.542 --> 01:46.087
We'll be lucky if we don't spend
the rest of our lives in jail.

01:46.171 --> 01:49.215
Why don't we take a
moment and be grateful...

01:50.299 --> 01:51.342
... that we're all alive?

01:53.845 --> 01:57.431
- Well, most of us.
- He was a good Christian man.

01:57.515 --> 02:00.476
- He deserves a proper burial.
- Of course.

02:05.314 --> 02:07.316
You lied to me!

02:08.442 --> 02:09.443
Both of you!

02:11.278 --> 02:15.783
I watched you turn into a wild animal.

02:17.160 --> 02:21.831
And you... I don't even know what you are.

02:21.915 --> 02:23.416
You're both monsters.

02:23.499 --> 02:26.961
- And this...
- What happened, happened, Miranda.

02:27.045 --> 02:28.922
The world that you thought
only existed in bad dreams

02:29.005 --> 02:30.090
is the one that you're living in now.

02:30.173 --> 02:32.759
And it's never gonna go
back to the way it was.

02:32.842 --> 02:36.012
- OK, it's all over. You're OK.
- Wh... what if they come back?

02:36.096 --> 02:39.265
They won't. They're dead. All of them.

02:45.813 --> 02:49.067
- I wanna go home.
- Hey.

02:49.150 --> 02:51.652
We need you.

02:51.736 --> 02:53.780
Nadia needs you.

02:55.907 --> 02:59.244
Let's just... sit down and relax...

02:59.326 --> 03:00.954
... a second.

03:05.499 --> 03:08.586
Here, why don't you lie down?

03:10.463 --> 03:13.258
Everything's gonna be all right.

03:20.598 --> 03:23.643
They were after the baby the whole time?

03:23.726 --> 03:26.229
All the other murders
were for nothing? Why?

03:26.311 --> 03:29.149
They thought they were making
the world a better place.

03:29.232 --> 03:31.025
We need to carry on like
nothing happened. OK?

03:31.109 --> 03:34.654
Go home, get some sleep. Be
sure to show up late for work,

03:34.737 --> 03:36.781
otherwise Templar will
know something's screwy.

03:36.864 --> 03:40.243
- What about the bodies?
- I'll handle it.

03:40.326 --> 03:43.454
- How?
- I'll figure something out.

03:51.087 --> 03:55.800
I'll head to 7-Eleven, get some
more bleach, finish up here.

03:55.883 --> 03:57.177
And then head to the diner.

03:57.260 --> 04:00.638
- Don't... don't leave me here alone.
- You won't be alone.

04:00.721 --> 04:02.098
Anna's here.

04:03.349 --> 04:04.684
Here. Drink this.

04:09.981 --> 04:13.651
One of your secret potions, handed
down through the mists of time?

04:15.278 --> 04:16.904
Vicodin and orange juice.

04:16.988 --> 04:20.283
Sometimes Big Pharma gets
the job done just fine.

04:25.330 --> 04:30.293
What you did last night... saving him...

04:30.376 --> 04:32.461
He would have done the same for me.

04:36.382 --> 04:39.052
Well, I guess I was wrong about you.

05:01.782 --> 05:04.451
How could anyone ever wanna hurt you?

05:11.209 --> 05:15.255
Anna, um, if there's anything
that I can do for you...

07:24.133 --> 07:26.135
Ding-dong, the witch is dead.

07:27.178 --> 07:30.473
Born Alyona Ivanovna Potyomkina-Zosimova,

07:30.556 --> 07:32.641
whom the Iraqis referred to

07:32.725 --> 07:37.188
as al-Akhbar al-Saiyya'
fi al-Ah 'thia Ma 'aqoula,

07:38.189 --> 07:40.691
Which, loosely translated,

07:40.774 --> 07:42.985
"bad news in sensible shoes."

07:43.069 --> 07:46.531
Now, your formidable acting skills not
withstanding, I know you killed her.

07:46.613 --> 07:48.741
- I have no idea what you're...
- Not to worry.

07:50.284 --> 07:52.578
She was becoming a liability.

07:54.163 --> 07:57.041
Actually...  you did me a favor.

08:03.005 --> 08:07.801
Uh... Well, about the matter at hand...

08:07.885 --> 08:09.929
What am I to do with you, Roman?

08:10.012 --> 08:13.766
You bully and browbeat me, then
ask me to save your human soul.

08:13.849 --> 08:17.019
But this time, you've
really outdone yourself.

08:17.103 --> 08:20.314
Roll up with a truckload of corpses
and expect me to make them disappear?

08:21.315 --> 08:22.942
Can you just fucking take care of it?

08:25.152 --> 08:28.114
That's no way for a man in your
position to ask for a favor.

08:29.865 --> 08:32.993
- Who were they?
- I have no idea.

08:34.328 --> 08:38.207
They attacked my house,
tried to kill me, my kid.

08:38.291 --> 08:41.001
- Why would they do such a thing?
- You'd have to ask them.

08:41.085 --> 08:43.837
But I'm guessing even you don't
have the technology to do that.

08:43.921 --> 08:45.798
Well, not yet.

08:47.758 --> 08:49.843
Let me hazard a guess,

08:49.927 --> 08:54.890
that their weapon of choice
was a bow of some sort.

08:56.016 --> 08:58.727
- How do you know that?
- The bishop was found murdered

08:58.811 --> 09:01.481
with more arrows in him
than Saint Sebastian.

09:01.564 --> 09:05.025
Which means that his
shares in the company...

09:05.109 --> 09:06.444
Are you gonna help me or not?

09:09.905 --> 09:12.199
I will clean up your mess.

09:12.283 --> 09:15.744
But there will be certain
conditions, to be named later.

09:15.828 --> 09:19.748
But first and foremost, you
must stop meddling in my work.

09:19.832 --> 09:23.210
- Do I have your word?
- Yes. Of course.

09:25.296 --> 09:30.468
- I wanna see my sister.
- She's... in treatment at the moment.

09:55.826 --> 09:59.079
Where on earth have you been?
It doesn't matter, I need a hug.

10:00.080 --> 10:02.124
What's the matter?

10:11.175 --> 10:15.721
Can't say I blame you giving me a
time-out after all that's gone on.

10:17.223 --> 10:21.477
I learned a new word today,
from Pryce, of all people.

10:21.561 --> 10:25.814
- "Solipsism," it means...
- One's self is the only existent thing.

10:27.233 --> 10:29.402
Johann was right. I haven't
just been a bad girlfriend.

10:29.485 --> 10:31.362
I've been living my life all wrong.

10:37.951 --> 10:41.830
I love you with all my heart,
Norman. I know that now.

10:41.914 --> 10:44.584
All the time lost.

10:46.252 --> 10:50.339
I need to make it up to you. Teach
me, so I can be your perfect woman.

10:50.423 --> 10:54.385
I'm ready to change. Look,
I even sing love songs now.

11:03.519 --> 11:04.729
Turn it off.

11:17.032 --> 11:22.037
Methotrexate, cyclophosphamide,

11:22.079 --> 11:25.374
carboplatin and etoposide.

11:25.458 --> 11:28.919
Wow. They've thrown the
whole Spanish Armada at you.

11:29.002 --> 11:33.382
Stage IV lymphoma, by the looks of it.

11:35.635 --> 11:38.887
At least I don't have to...
stand in front of the mirror

11:38.971 --> 11:41.056
practicing how to tell you.

11:42.391 --> 11:47.896
I'm not giving up, no matter how
long the odds. I'm gonna beat this.

11:49.565 --> 11:52.067
I've been a failure as a mother.

11:52.151 --> 11:56.947
This is an opportunity to... regain the
respect of my children by standing tall.

11:58.574 --> 12:02.453
And if I'm not to be, I'm
going to live out my life

12:02.536 --> 12:07.249
with love, compassion,
and you as my North Star.

12:07.333 --> 12:11.128
You really are something, Olivia.

12:12.963 --> 12:15.758
Aspiring to become an obedient mate.

12:15.840 --> 12:17.217
Within reason.

12:17.301 --> 12:21.263
A chanteuse, valiant survivor.

12:22.515 --> 12:24.266
If fate allows.

12:24.350 --> 12:29.313
Do you know that Saint Paul was
a loathsome, murderous cocksucker,

12:29.396 --> 12:35.194
but history regards him favorably
because he turned his legacy around.

12:35.277 --> 12:38.155
You will not be afforded that opportunity.

12:39.448 --> 12:41.408
This one makes your bones so brittle

12:41.492 --> 12:44.286
that you could break an arm
getting dressed in the morning.

12:44.370 --> 12:49.041
This one is for the purple lesions
that will cover your face and neck,

12:49.124 --> 12:52.002
but your hair, fingernails
and teeth will fall out

12:52.085 --> 12:55.088
and it will turn your
eyes the color of mustard.

12:55.172 --> 12:56.590
Why are you talking like this?

12:56.674 --> 12:58.843
Oooh... the miracle drug.

12:58.925 --> 13:02.388
Absorbs through the kidneys,
but yours will become so necrotic

13:02.471 --> 13:05.766
and gangrenous as the cancer
spreads, they'll have to be removed.

13:05.850 --> 13:08.519
- So you're out of luck there.
- Please stop.

13:08.602 --> 13:11.689
You will smell dead months
before you actually are.

13:11.772 --> 13:14.525
Like rancid dogfish.

13:14.608 --> 13:19.154
It'll hurt you just to breathe,
to swallow, and... and...

13:20.531 --> 13:23.992
... you'll lose your taste for blood.

13:28.163 --> 13:30.915
I didn't tell you...

13:30.999 --> 13:33.878
... in order to protect
you. Protect us. I...

13:33.960 --> 13:35.920
I was afraid this would happen.
That you wouldn't understand.

13:36.004 --> 13:38.257
I wouldn't understand that
you feast on human suffering?

13:38.340 --> 13:41.009
It's not like that, not anymore,
because of Johann's work.

13:41.093 --> 13:42.927
- Jesus, is he one, too?
- Of course not.

13:43.011 --> 13:44.805
You know...

13:45.930 --> 13:47.808
... I came here to kill you.

13:49.727 --> 13:50.895
I know how much I've hurt you...

13:50.977 --> 13:53.355
- But to alleviate your suffering...
- Please forgive me.

13:53.439 --> 13:54.939
- ... with a swift death...
- We can be a family.

13:55.023 --> 13:56.358
- ... would not only be wrong...
- The two of us.

13:56.442 --> 13:58.652
- ... that would be wrong...
- With Shelley! Our son!

13:58.736 --> 14:00.654
- ... it would be deeply unsatisfying!
- We could be together

14:00.738 --> 14:03.156
- for the little time I have left!
- No. No!

14:05.950 --> 14:08.537
I'm gonna watch you die horribly.

14:10.205 --> 14:13.876
It's the least that I can do for Marie.

14:15.043 --> 14:17.379
I owe it to her memory.

14:19.256 --> 14:21.842
I didn't have a choice.

14:21.926 --> 14:25.596
She tried to kill me to punish you.

14:25.679 --> 14:28.557
That's how much Marie hated you.

14:29.809 --> 14:32.853
Norman, I had to defend myself.
You have to believe me. Norman!

14:32.937 --> 14:35.439
Please, you have to believe me!

14:47.618 --> 14:49.745
Fuck me.

14:55.375 --> 14:57.377
Fuck you.

15:05.177 --> 15:06.386
Good morning, Pearl.

15:08.597 --> 15:12.643
- You're looking beautific, as always.
- Ah, morning, Doctor.

15:15.562 --> 15:18.816
What's on today's menu
of disease and contagion?

15:18.899 --> 15:21.652
Oh, Mrs. Blakelock called again.

15:21.735 --> 15:24.989
She thinks she has malaria and is dying.

15:25.071 --> 15:27.908
We should be so lucky.

15:27.992 --> 15:30.452
This is damn fine coffee, by the way.

15:30.536 --> 15:32.663
Miranda Cates called. She sounded upset.

15:32.746 --> 15:34.164
- About?
- She wouldn't say.

15:34.247 --> 15:36.375
She's on her way over here now.

15:36.458 --> 15:38.794
I need her chart, if you'd be so kind.

15:38.878 --> 15:41.087
And would you, uh, pop over
to the medical supplier?

15:41.171 --> 15:43.507
We're running low on tongue
depressors and latex gloves.

15:43.590 --> 15:45.885
I'm pretty sure there's a
box of gloves in the closet.

15:45.968 --> 15:48.679
- No, checked last night. Nada.
- You want me to go right this second?

15:48.762 --> 15:51.223
- Yeah. Before it gets hectic.
- But the phones...

15:51.306 --> 15:53.475
I come from a long line of multitaskers.

15:54.476 --> 15:56.770
Oh, and some cotton swabs, too.

15:56.854 --> 15:58.355
Can't have too many cotton swabs.

15:58.438 --> 16:00.232
You're a pearl of a girl.

16:01.775 --> 16:03.318
Alrighty.

16:04.695 --> 16:06.446
Thank you, Pearl.

16:11.284 --> 16:13.871
- It's time?
- It is.

16:15.706 --> 16:20.460
I'll stay here with you. Nothing
to worry about ever again.

16:21.294 --> 16:23.255
Just one last thing.

16:23.338 --> 16:26.091
If the people in town find my body,

16:26.174 --> 16:28.385
I'm worried about what
they'll d... do with it.

16:28.468 --> 16:31.263
I will make sure the
police will find it first.

16:31.346 --> 16:34.307
After the inquest, it will
rest in your family plot.

16:34.391 --> 16:37.477
Please, not there.

16:37.561 --> 16:39.939
Is there someplace else?

16:41.106 --> 16:42.148
The river.

16:42.232 --> 16:45.402
The old cemetery looks over it.

16:45.485 --> 16:49.073
- I used to go there...
- After school, to sit, to read.

16:49.155 --> 16:50.991
It was the only place I could be alone.

16:51.075 --> 16:52.785
It's beautiful.

16:52.868 --> 16:54.787
It's perfect.

16:54.870 --> 16:56.997
Then that is where you will be.

16:57.081 --> 17:00.417
Among the hemlocks, overlooking the river.

17:01.835 --> 17:04.253
- One more thing.
- Jason.

17:04.337 --> 17:07.339
He's been placed in foster
care with a good family.

17:08.340 --> 17:11.261
He'll be protected, I will make sure of it.

17:17.851 --> 17:19.394
I'm ready.

17:35.953 --> 17:36.996
Bach.

17:37.079 --> 17:40.499
The first concert you took me to, Uncle.

17:40.582 --> 17:42.709
The Philadelphia Orchestra.

17:42.793 --> 17:45.629
I was hoping you'd have
fond memories of it.

18:10.320 --> 18:12.072
Sleep now.

18:13.073 --> 18:15.034
Darling Shelley.

18:39.432 --> 18:42.728
- How long till...
- About 25 minutes.

18:45.438 --> 18:47.607
I don't know if I can do this. I'm sorry.

18:47.691 --> 18:51.737
- I wanna stay...
- You were here when she needed you.

19:25.812 --> 19:27.898
Hello?

19:32.069 --> 19:33.987
I'm back.

19:36.698 --> 19:39.243
Miranda?

19:46.083 --> 19:47.209
Hello?

19:51.504 --> 19:53.298
Miranda?

20:34.965 --> 20:37.259
I just fed her two hours ago
and everything was normal.

20:37.342 --> 20:40.929
I mean, if you can call any of this
normal. Then, I just started bleeding!

20:41.013 --> 20:44.224
Shh. It's OK, it's OK. The baby's fine.

20:44.308 --> 20:46.434
- Yeah, but what if...
- What if an asteroid slammed

20:46.518 --> 20:49.562
into planet Earth and sent
us all careening into the sun?

20:49.646 --> 20:53.608
Living in the land of "what ifs"
will make you crazy as a loon.

20:56.611 --> 20:58.905
That's a loon call, in case you
thought I was baying at the moon.

20:58.989 --> 21:01.700
All right. Let's have a look at Mom.

21:01.783 --> 21:05.204
Not biological Mom, but de facto Mom.

21:05.329 --> 21:07.580
But Mom nonetheless, as
far as she's concerned.

21:07.664 --> 21:10.876
Well, what if... uh, suppose...

21:10.959 --> 21:13.045
... Nadia swallowed some of my blood?

21:13.128 --> 21:15.588
Um, to put it in human
terms, palindromic discharge

21:15.672 --> 21:18.217
is a precursor to zygote matrix expansion,

21:18.300 --> 21:21.970
but doesn't usually present
itself quite this early, so...

21:22.054 --> 21:25.390
- What does any of that even mean?
- You under a lot of stress these days?

21:27.600 --> 21:28.685
Hm.

21:32.272 --> 21:35.567
Pryce. What the hell's going on?

21:37.819 --> 21:41.240
I tried to visit Shelley just now, but
security wouldn't let me near her room.

21:41.323 --> 21:44.409
- Have a seat.
- I don't wanna sit. I want answers.

21:44.492 --> 21:46.119
It was your niece's
wish that you be informed

21:46.203 --> 21:48.121
as soon as the procedure is complete.

21:48.205 --> 21:52.625
So now I'm at liberty to explain
what has taken place in broad strokes.

21:56.129 --> 21:59.758
Norman, Shelley Godfrey is
not her physical persona.

21:59.841 --> 22:03.178
Shelley Godfrey is the
spirit inside the girl.

22:03.262 --> 22:05.889
My breakthrough in
extrauterine fetal incubation...

22:05.972 --> 22:08.600
We've managed to preserve
that and create a situation

22:08.683 --> 22:12.145
where she's allowed to succeed
and be happy in every possible way.

22:12.229 --> 22:15.899
Project Ouroboros was the
creation originally of a host body,

22:15.982 --> 22:20.444
which I realized, upon her return, could
serve as a home for the new Shelley.

22:20.528 --> 22:22.572
... conducting atmospheric oxygen

22:22.655 --> 22:24.408
and fluorocarbon mixture through the...

22:24.490 --> 22:27.369
We created an amniotic tank
with simulated zero gravity.

22:27.451 --> 22:29.788
We uploaded the real Shelley's
consciousness to the server,

22:29.871 --> 22:33.125
then re-downloaded it into the new body,

22:33.208 --> 22:36.711
creating a woman without physical ailments,

22:36.795 --> 22:40.215
able to enjoy her life.

22:43.135 --> 22:45.387
You wretched little cunt!

22:46.554 --> 22:48.432
I ought to smack the shit out of you!

22:49.308 --> 22:51.226
I am aware our relationship
is strained at best,

22:51.310 --> 22:53.186
however, there's no occasion for threats.

22:53.270 --> 22:55.897
Or your less pleasant
characterizations of me.

22:55.981 --> 22:58.942
Preying on a little girl who'd do anything

22:59.025 --> 23:01.611
for the slightest shred
of approval from Olivia,

23:01.694 --> 23:03.905
who's only too happy to victimize

23:03.989 --> 23:06.450
her physically imperfect
daughter for vanity's sake.

23:06.532 --> 23:10.494
And you, so you can add to your
resume of scientific achievements,

23:10.620 --> 23:13.832
- however freakish.
- This was all Shelley's idea.

23:13.915 --> 23:16.542
As far as public recognition,
I've agreed to her condition

23:16.626 --> 23:19.921
for absolute secrecy to
protect her anonymity.

23:20.005 --> 23:23.216
I've sacrificed 20 years of
research and my place in history

23:23.300 --> 23:25.760
to give your niece a shot at a better life.

23:25.844 --> 23:28.305
- Happily so.
- Saint Johann.

23:28.388 --> 23:30.432
I will light a fucking candle.

23:30.514 --> 23:34.019
You don't seriously expect me to believe
that Olivia wasn't behind this sick

23:34.102 --> 23:36.855
- and twisted extreme makeover.
- Not only did Olivia have nothing

23:36.938 --> 23:39.649
to do with it, she was acting against
her own best interest in the matter.

23:39.732 --> 23:43.028
Olivia's only interest is Olivia.
But I don't need to tell you.

23:43.111 --> 23:45.155
I mean, as her personal physician,
I'm sure you know everything

23:45.238 --> 23:47.991
- there is to know about Olivia.
- There is a theory,

23:48.074 --> 23:51.286
not wholly without merit, that
this host anatomy, the pretty one,

23:51.370 --> 23:53.413
if you will, can be repurposed,

23:53.497 --> 23:57.250
broken down into component
parts to cure her cancer.

23:57.334 --> 23:58.877
You are aware she has terminal cancer?

23:58.960 --> 24:02.339
- Among her other pathologies.
- Yet, she insisted that Shelley

24:02.422 --> 24:04.966
have the body, even though
it could cost Olivia her life.

24:05.050 --> 24:07.260
I've known this woman for 20
years. You don't seriously believe

24:07.344 --> 24:09.553
that she's gonna go out in a
sudden flourish of generosity.

24:09.637 --> 24:12.891
Well, apparently, we have you to thank
for her breathtaking transformation.

24:12.974 --> 24:15.310
- Oh, really, me?
- She loves you.

24:15.394 --> 24:18.271
Deeply, Norman.

24:18.355 --> 24:20.815
She would sacrifice
anything, even her own life,

24:20.899 --> 24:23.651
if it would earn your love and respect.

24:23.735 --> 24:26.446
I heard her use those very words...

24:26.530 --> 24:30.450
... without the slightest
shred of irony or misgiving.

24:31.493 --> 24:34.037
Remarkable what people will do for love.

24:35.080 --> 24:36.915
Even Olivia.

24:42.087 --> 24:46.841
If Olivia were to change her mind
and use this anatomy for spare parts,

24:46.925 --> 24:50.594
after all, where would that leave Shelley?

24:55.599 --> 24:57.519
As of three minutes ago, dead.

25:09.781 --> 25:12.451
No vital signs. Doctor, it's...

25:15.161 --> 25:17.247
Give her an amp of epi!

25:17.872 --> 25:19.165
Stat!

25:25.255 --> 25:27.006
Hello, dear.

25:29.633 --> 25:31.553
Where's the paddles?

25:31.635 --> 25:33.597
Give me the paddles! Give me the paddles!

25:33.679 --> 25:36.099
Come on!

25:37.392 --> 25:41.104
OK, clear!

25:41.187 --> 25:43.022
Clear!

25:44.857 --> 25:46.025
Going again. Clear!

25:50.572 --> 25:52.656
Going again. Clear!

25:55.285 --> 25:57.078
Doctor, you'll do permanent damage...

25:57.120 --> 25:58.371
She's already dead.

25:59.663 --> 26:00.832
Clear!

26:29.235 --> 26:32.656
W... why?

26:32.738 --> 26:34.907
Why?!

26:58.223 --> 27:00.808
Thanks, Johann. I needed that.

27:00.892 --> 27:04.187
Now, I'm going to find my granddaughter.

28:19.929 --> 28:22.848
So I got some good news and some bad news.

28:23.849 --> 28:26.478
The good news is there is no bad news.

28:27.853 --> 28:30.273
I have blood leaking out of
my nipples, for God's sake.

28:30.356 --> 28:33.234
Yeah, it's caused by an amino
acid cocktail you're taking

28:33.318 --> 28:35.612
to supercharge your mother's milk.
I mean, I'd dial back on the dosage,

28:35.695 --> 28:39.949
but it's the telekinetic valence
inhibitor I'm using as a, uh...

28:40.032 --> 28:42.619
... I don't know, psychic camouflage,
I guess the best way to explain it.

28:42.702 --> 28:45.037
Yes, you are the cutest
baby ever! Yes, you are!

28:45.121 --> 28:47.582
I don't know what you're
talking about right now.

28:47.666 --> 28:49.875
None of this would have
happened without you, Miranda.

28:49.959 --> 28:52.128
Oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord.

28:52.211 --> 28:53.505
Right?

28:53.588 --> 28:58.802
You are the proverbial
needle in the... DNA haystack.

28:58.884 --> 29:00.637
Please give her to me...

29:00.720 --> 29:03.097
Thank God you walked into
that blood bank in Bangor,

29:03.181 --> 29:05.266
or the whole project would
have been up shit creek!

29:06.225 --> 29:09.895
Just have to forget about
populating the gravity shelf, yeah!

29:09.979 --> 29:12.940
- Yeah!
- You're, uh... you're scaring me.

29:13.024 --> 29:17.737
Come on, those other people were
scary. Those religiosos? Ay-yi-yi.

29:17.821 --> 29:19.030
The heck was that all about?

29:19.113 --> 29:23.075
Heaven help us if they had
harmed the cutest baby ever.

29:23.159 --> 29:24.285
- Yeah, you are...
- Give her to me!

29:24.369 --> 29:27.413
Yeah, you are!

29:27.497 --> 29:29.541
Look at that. I ask you,

29:29.624 --> 29:32.126
does that face look like it
belongs to the Queen of the Damned?

29:33.127 --> 29:36.005
Whatever nonsense those idiots
were carrying on about? Huh?

29:36.088 --> 29:39.008
Who are you? What do you want?

29:39.091 --> 29:41.845
Well, most people can't answer
either of those questions.

29:41.927 --> 29:45.056
Who I am requires a longer explanation
than we have time for right now.

29:45.139 --> 29:48.976
What I want... is right here.

29:49.060 --> 29:50.436
In this room. You.

29:52.063 --> 29:56.818
With your florid, abundant
milk production, my Lord.

29:56.901 --> 30:01.489
Which has allowed us to triple
her ovum output, by the way. Yes!

30:01.573 --> 30:04.283
You got more eggs inside of you
than you know what to do with.

30:04.367 --> 30:06.661
- Yeah, you do!
- What?

30:06.745 --> 30:10.998
Yeah, you do. You know my one
regret, though, I gotta tell you,

30:11.082 --> 30:14.586
is the chicanery it took to
waylay you here in Hemlock Grove.

30:15.127 --> 30:18.964
But know this. Never once were you
in any danger on the road that night.

30:20.800 --> 30:25.388
On my honor, as your
exo-morphic interface.

30:25.471 --> 30:28.391
That was you?

30:30.935 --> 30:34.522
Slow down now! I'll stick
you in the bum with Thorazine!

30:34.606 --> 30:37.567
Huh? We'll be flying out of here
soon. I can't have you all wiggy.

30:42.655 --> 30:45.283
- And what is all this then?
- Olivia, you're looking well.

30:45.366 --> 30:46.951
- How are you?
- Dying of cancer.

30:47.034 --> 30:50.162
- But otherwise no complaints.
- Oh! You are nothing if not a survivor.

30:50.246 --> 30:52.164
- I'll hold a good thought.
- Hm. Thank you.

30:52.248 --> 30:54.292
I understand you're
treating my granddaughter.

30:54.375 --> 30:56.669
- Routine checkup.
- I'm surprised my son's letting you

30:56.753 --> 30:58.212
- into his confidence.
- He's been poisoning...

30:58.296 --> 31:00.298
You're done playing mommy.

31:03.426 --> 31:05.929
- I'm here to collect the baby.
- I'm sorry, I'm not at liberty

31:06.011 --> 31:08.890
- to release her to your care.
- Oh, come off it, Arnold.

31:08.973 --> 31:10.767
I'm her blood relative, for fuck's sake.

31:10.850 --> 31:12.852
Well, some things are thicker than blood.

31:38.085 --> 31:40.672
Mrs. Godfrey just made it very clear.

31:40.755 --> 31:42.757
You're not leaving with that child.

31:42.841 --> 31:44.258
- Give her to me.
- No fucking way!

31:48.387 --> 31:51.474
All the unhappiness
started since you arrived!

31:51.557 --> 31:54.560
- Mr. Conway is dead because of you.
- Let go of her!

31:56.354 --> 31:58.857
Everything bad happened because of you!

31:58.940 --> 32:00.566
I will fucking hit you, you old bitch!

32:03.695 --> 32:05.154
- No, no, no! Don't hurt her!
- Give her to me!

32:05.237 --> 32:07.114
Don't hurt her!

32:38.354 --> 32:40.982
Aah!

32:54.037 --> 32:58.457
Physician, heal thyself,
or whatever you are.

33:08.634 --> 33:12.889
- Who the fuck are you?
- An unsatisfied customer.

33:12.972 --> 33:16.434
Now, although good for an upset stomach,

33:16.517 --> 33:19.186
your Sebzilla didn't live
up to the sales pitch.

33:19.270 --> 33:24.943
- I... I can get you your money.
- No, I'm tired of empty promises.

33:26.151 --> 33:28.237
Take off your clothes.

33:34.243 --> 33:37.580
Take your fucking clothes off.

33:54.263 --> 33:57.600
I want Section G sealed. No one in or out.

33:57.683 --> 34:00.394
Anyone without Yankee 12 clearance
should be dismissed and sent home

34:00.478 --> 34:01.980
for the rest of the day.

34:03.648 --> 34:05.691
This begins and ends with your mother.

34:18.579 --> 34:22.206
He has scales under his skin. And
he's using me to control the baby,

34:22.291 --> 34:25.920
which is why my tits are
bleeding. And your mother...

34:26.004 --> 34:27.797
Oh, God, your mother's after her, too.

34:27.880 --> 34:30.341
- Where are you? Where's Nadia?
- She killed Anna.

34:31.382 --> 34:33.803
She killed her, just like
she killed the other guy.

34:33.886 --> 34:35.179
Anna's dead?

34:35.262 --> 34:37.681
She's probably making us have those dreams,

34:37.764 --> 34:39.934
you, me and Peter.

34:40.018 --> 34:42.061
And I'm... why I'm lactating.

34:42.145 --> 34:44.688
And the doc... He's not a doctor.

34:44.772 --> 34:46.107
He used me, and...

34:47.025 --> 34:49.400
... he has scales under his skin.

34:49.485 --> 34:52.404
Listen, I want you to come
to the White Tower, OK?

34:52.487 --> 34:54.866
- They're coming after us.
- They can't get you here.

34:54.949 --> 34:57.201
I promise, I'll take care of you both, OK?

34:57.284 --> 34:59.704
OK. OK.

35:06.169 --> 35:08.004
Olivia's after the baby.

35:27.023 --> 35:28.315
Dr. Spivak!

35:32.111 --> 35:33.487
911, what is your emergency?

35:33.571 --> 35:35.573
Dr. Spivak!

35:37.324 --> 35:39.785
Oh... Oh, my God!

35:47.210 --> 35:48.961
Testes die within minutes.

35:49.045 --> 35:51.756
Eventually, they wither,
turn black, and fall off,

35:51.839 --> 35:53.925
like grapes from a vine.

35:54.008 --> 35:56.510
You sure seem to know
a lot about men's balls.

35:56.594 --> 35:57.762
How's that working out for you?

36:02.349 --> 36:05.352
Put these on before I lose my temper
and decide to take the whole package.

36:12.359 --> 36:14.820
Peter, we gotta...

36:23.746 --> 36:26.498
You're gonna wanna put that down.

36:26.582 --> 36:31.503
You know, the last guy who laid hands
on me got a shank in the dick. So...

36:31.587 --> 36:36.217
Sweetheart, I'm guessing sweet-talking
isn't what your mouth does best.

36:38.261 --> 36:41.055
Stop. Your beef is with me, not with her.

36:42.056 --> 36:46.018
Put the gun down, and kick it over here.

37:05.704 --> 37:08.166
- Cuff him, sweet dam.
- Let her go.

37:08.249 --> 37:14.630
Oh, I will. See, I always wondered
how my gear would work on lady parts.

37:14.713 --> 37:16.882
Add to my collection.

37:25.057 --> 37:27.518
No, Peter, don't.

37:27.601 --> 37:30.646
Please, I already lost you once.

37:30.729 --> 37:32.690
You're gonna have to kill me after.

37:32.773 --> 37:35.151
What? No.

37:35.234 --> 37:36.944
It's the only way you'll be safe.

37:37.028 --> 37:38.946
- Promise me.
- No.

37:41.657 --> 37:44.076
Ride or die.

37:49.498 --> 37:50.499
Cuff him.

37:52.001 --> 37:53.002
Peter...

38:00.092 --> 38:02.345
- You OK, Creamsicle?
- What the fuck?

38:02.427 --> 38:04.305
Andreas, why do you have
a silencer on your gun?

38:04.388 --> 38:05.472
Why do you have a gun?

38:05.556 --> 38:08.684
That, my friends, is a
conversation for another time.

38:08.767 --> 38:11.812
You should go, now. Place will
be all tidy when you get back.

38:11.896 --> 38:14.398
- Let me help you.
- No, no, no, no.

38:14.481 --> 38:16.775
Hurry up, there's no time. We
have to get to the White Tower.

38:18.194 --> 38:19.862
This is all my fault.

38:19.945 --> 38:22.948
- What?
- What Nadia's turning into.

38:23.032 --> 38:25.701
Because of my breast milk.

38:25.784 --> 38:28.620
Dr. Spivak said that none of this
could have happened without me.

38:28.704 --> 38:30.998
He called me a needle
in a haystack of DNA...

38:31.082 --> 38:34.877
Look, look... You've been
through a lot. I get it.

38:34.960 --> 38:39.506
You probably have PTSD or whatever.
I'll talk to Dr. Pryce, I'm sure...

38:39.590 --> 38:42.927
No, no! No more doctors.
Please, promise me.

38:43.010 --> 38:45.096
OK.

38:46.055 --> 38:48.099
I just feel so bad for her.

38:49.516 --> 38:52.937
She would be completely lost without you.

38:53.020 --> 38:54.479
So would I.

38:54.563 --> 38:57.066
So would all of us.

38:58.192 --> 39:01.404
Sorry. What?

39:01.486 --> 39:03.322
There are two people here
to see you, Mr. Godfrey.

39:03.406 --> 39:04.865
They say they know you and it's urgent.

39:04.949 --> 39:09.703
- Uh, Peter and Destiny Romantic.
- It's Rumancek, you twat.

39:09.787 --> 39:12.831
Send them to level SB. I'll, uh...
I'll meet them at the elevators.

39:12.915 --> 39:15.293
I can't do that, sir.
They don't have clearance.

39:16.294 --> 39:17.544
I'm giving them clearance.

39:17.628 --> 39:19.922
I need written
authorization from Dr. Pryce.

39:20.005 --> 39:22.633
See the name on top of this building, yeah?

39:22.716 --> 39:24.843
That's my name. You stay right there,

39:24.927 --> 39:27.388
so I can fire your fucktard ass in person.

39:33.560 --> 39:37.481
Peter and Destiny are upstairs.
Uh... Wait here, I'll be right back.

39:37.564 --> 39:41.526
- No, don't leave me!
- No one can get to you here. OK?

39:41.610 --> 39:44.029
- You'll be fine.
- Yeah, but what if...

39:45.781 --> 39:48.951
OK, um... go take a look at the monkey.

39:49.034 --> 39:50.911
Through those doors.

39:51.036 --> 39:54.248
He's a hoot. Better than
television. I'll be right back. OK?

40:19.315 --> 40:21.775
Take her down to the behavioral
unit! Four-point tie-down!

40:21.859 --> 40:23.861
Nurse, 50 cc's of Haldol IM.

40:23.944 --> 40:26.905
I want her monitored round the clock
to make sure she doesn't hurt herself.

42:15.889 --> 42:19.935
Whatever bad mojo you saw in your
dream, nobody's coming down here.

42:21.979 --> 42:23.647
Miranda?

42:31.780 --> 42:34.241
State-of-the-art building
with a security apparatus

42:34.325 --> 42:36.743
more sophisticated than the
embassy in fucking Baghdad

42:36.827 --> 42:38.996
- and you have no idea where she is?
- She wasn't issued a badge

42:39.079 --> 42:40.539
with a locator chip.

42:40.623 --> 42:42.625
Neither were your friends.

42:42.749 --> 42:45.294
You're out of excuses! Find her!

44:11.796 --> 44:15.342
It took me 20 years to realize
how much I wanted your heart.

44:19.471 --> 44:20.598
Now it's mine.

45:37.966 --> 45:39.884
Clearing level six.

45:58.320 --> 46:00.113
Hey, coz, you OK?

46:01.156 --> 46:02.574
That dream, when we got back to your place.

46:05.160 --> 46:06.286
The roof.

47:07.138 --> 47:09.600
- Miranda!
- Miranda! Miranda, wait.

47:09.683 --> 47:12.686
You don't wanna do this.

47:12.770 --> 47:15.522
- Don't hurt the baby!
- All I ever did was love you.

47:16.815 --> 47:19.234
They should have killed me instead.

47:19.317 --> 47:20.943
- Give her to me.
- Hey!

47:21.027 --> 47:24.947
You were born an angel and I...
I turned you into a monster.

47:25.031 --> 47:27.743
- Miranda, get back here.
- I never meant to hurt you.

47:28.993 --> 47:30.871
Everything's gonna be OK.

47:30.953 --> 47:32.456
Listen to me. Listen to me, get back here.

47:34.082 --> 47:38.462
You'll see your real mom soon. I'm sorry.

47:41.214 --> 47:42.883
- No!
- No!
