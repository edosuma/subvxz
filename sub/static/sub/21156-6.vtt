01:48.984 --> 01:50.324
I'm sorry, is this seat taken?

01:50.402 --> 01:51.652
Oh, um,

01:51.737 --> 01:55.567
well, I was saving it for someone,
but he's late, so go ahead.

01:55.657 --> 01:57.657
Thanks, and who's that?

01:59.077 --> 02:01.207
-My husband.
-Aww.

02:01.622 --> 02:04.632
Oh. Oh, well,
he shouldn't keep you waiting.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.878
Yeah, he's a bit of a prick like that.

02:07.211 --> 02:09.461
-Always working.
-Hmm.

02:09.545 --> 02:10.455
[Michael laughs]

02:11.048 --> 02:12.928
Can I, uh...
Can I buy you a drink?

02:13.008 --> 02:14.548
Maybe something a little harder?

02:14.634 --> 02:17.514
Yeah, okay. Um, I'll take a--

02:17.595 --> 02:19.425
Old Fashioned? Something?

02:19.515 --> 02:20.715
Good guess.

02:20.807 --> 02:22.637
Well, I have my moments.

02:23.226 --> 02:25.896
Excuse me, hi.
Can I have an old fashioned with Bulleit?

02:25.979 --> 02:29.109
And a dirty martini with three olives?

02:29.691 --> 02:30.531
[Jean] Thank you.

02:32.193 --> 02:34.073
So, what does he do, this, um...

02:34.571 --> 02:35.821
husband of yours?

02:36.281 --> 02:39.411
-He's a lawyer.
-Ooh, yikes. God, sorry.

02:39.492 --> 02:42.502
No offense, but those guys, man.

02:43.455 --> 02:45.115
-They're the worst.
-I know.

02:45.206 --> 02:46.916
-So by the book.
-Mm-hmm

02:47.000 --> 02:50.170
You seem way too free-spirited
to be with a lawyer.

02:50.587 --> 02:53.207
-Yeah, maybe I am.
-Yeah.

02:53.715 --> 02:55.295
I think you need more of a visionary.

02:55.884 --> 02:56.934
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

02:57.010 --> 02:57.850
Hmm.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.272
-How do you know?
-Oh, it's just what I do.

03:01.807 --> 03:04.347
Really? And what is it you do?

03:04.977 --> 03:05.977
I'm an architect.

03:06.979 --> 03:09.569
-Ah.
-Can you tell by the shirt?

03:10.399 --> 03:11.229
Yeah.

03:12.901 --> 03:15.111
I always wanted to meet an architect.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.855
And now, you have. What does it feel like?

03:18.365 --> 03:19.825
Yeah, it's good.

03:20.993 --> 03:22.793
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.580
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

03:24.662 --> 03:27.752
-So nice to meet you.
-So nice to meet you, too.

03:32.296 --> 03:35.876
-You're married, huh?
-No, no. I just never...

03:36.800 --> 03:39.390
you know, found the right...
the right woman.

03:39.845 --> 03:41.095
You believe in that?

03:41.180 --> 03:43.140
I don't know, I mean...

03:45.517 --> 03:46.597
Used to.

03:48.520 --> 03:53.070
Well, I'm sure you have plenty of hot
young women throwing themselves at you.

03:53.734 --> 03:56.494
You're a handsome, powerful architect.

03:58.321 --> 03:59.281
You think I'm handsome?

04:00.199 --> 04:01.199
Maybe.

04:03.201 --> 04:04.661
Well, I do have options.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.959
But it seems that, um...

04:08.040 --> 04:10.670
that the woman that I want is taken.

04:13.003 --> 04:13.843
Well...

04:14.379 --> 04:16.839
that just makes it more fun, doesn't it?

04:17.966 --> 04:20.005
Only if you're willing to break the rules.

04:21.386 --> 04:23.596
I never said I was faithful.

04:24.348 --> 04:27.018
Oh, I see.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.731
And, um...

04:34.441 --> 04:35.941
does your husband know?

04:37.277 --> 04:39.527
He's too busy to notice.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.656
But, you know, trying to control myself.

04:47.746 --> 04:48.746
I think.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.079
So, do you work?

04:52.167 --> 04:53.167
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.
-You do?

04:53.252 --> 04:55.592
-I mean, sometimes, yeah.
-Really? What do you do?

04:55.963 --> 04:57.423
A musician, actually.

04:57.798 --> 04:58.878
Oh, wow.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.546
-Yeah, not really the pop star type,
-That's cool, okay.

05:01.634 --> 05:04.554
but just more of the-- I write songs.

05:05.054 --> 05:07.524
-Even so, that's, um--
-[laughing]

05:08.642 --> 05:09.482
That's really...

05:09.852 --> 05:11.352
fucking hot.

05:11.436 --> 05:12.396
And unexpected.

05:12.478 --> 05:15.858
Oh, good. Well, I like to surprise you.

05:15.940 --> 05:18.820
You know, every time I come here,
they give me a really great room,

05:18.902 --> 05:20.532
if you wanted to go...

05:21.446 --> 05:22.696
upstairs.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.906
Um, well...

05:25.492 --> 05:28.202
See, we'd have to be quick, 'cause--

05:28.786 --> 05:31.246
Can I get the check, please?
Thank you.

05:31.874 --> 05:34.634
Oh, I never did ask you your name.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.344
Sidney.

05:47.639 --> 05:49.889
[heavy breathing]

05:55.313 --> 05:58.323
[both breathing heavily]

06:14.582 --> 06:16.582
[grunting]

06:16.668 --> 06:17.958
You like that, Sidney?

06:29.973 --> 06:32.063
[electric razor buzzing]

06:49.493 --> 06:50.413
Hey.

06:53.121 --> 06:54.751
Hi, sleepyhead.

06:55.790 --> 06:59.000
Come here. I don't want this to be over.

06:59.085 --> 07:01.295
Aww. Well...

07:01.380 --> 07:04.760
Hey, don't do that! I have to go to work.

07:05.300 --> 07:06.300
[kissing]

07:08.595 --> 07:11.005
I don't have a patient till one, come on.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.018
-Mmm.
-Come on.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.519
Order some breakfast, okay? And relax.

07:14.601 --> 07:15.771
[groans]

07:16.562 --> 07:17.732
I'll miss you.

07:21.525 --> 07:23.185
Last night was amazing.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.612
-It was really amazing.
-I know.

07:27.698 --> 07:30.618
It was very, very amazing, but...

07:31.869 --> 07:34.199
I'm glad that we're not those people.

07:36.748 --> 07:38.378
I really like who we are.

08:05.651 --> 08:06.741
[door opens]

08:47.236 --> 08:48.646
[phone ringing]

08:49.780 --> 08:50.860
[man] Room service.

08:52.574 --> 08:55.164
Hello. Hello?

09:06.547 --> 09:07.547
Hey.

09:08.590 --> 09:09.970
Swanky choice.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.340
-Yeah, I just had a meeting.
-Sure you did.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.063
Oh, here.

09:19.308 --> 09:20.768
You can order whatever you want.

09:21.770 --> 09:23.980
Yeah, it's really not my scene.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.274
[laughing]

09:25.357 --> 09:28.277
But I'm sure these people would come
to Brooklyn and say the same thing.

09:37.411 --> 09:38.581
-Oh, my.
-Mm.

09:39.287 --> 09:40.617
-They look good on you.
-Oh, yeah?

09:45.585 --> 09:47.915
-Good morning.
-Hi, she's gonna have--

09:48.004 --> 09:49.014
Pancakes, please.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.469
And I'll take
an egg white omelet, please.

09:58.974 --> 10:00.234
[Sidney] You know, um...

10:00.976 --> 10:03.226
You didn't even kiss me "hello."

10:03.811 --> 10:06.611
I assumed we're past that stage
after the other night.

10:07.733 --> 10:09.403
That was quite a kiss.

10:09.483 --> 10:11.323
Hmm. Well, uh...

10:14.614 --> 10:15.954
Maybe we should go upstairs?

10:17.326 --> 10:19.746
-What?
-Well, you invited me here,

10:19.828 --> 10:21.288
I assume you have a room.

10:21.914 --> 10:24.634
That was... quite an assumption.

10:24.708 --> 10:26.878
I, uh, told you I had a meeting.

10:27.878 --> 10:28.708
With who?

10:29.838 --> 10:32.548
An architect. He's redesigning this place.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.840
I'm writing a piece on him.

10:35.426 --> 10:36.636
What's he like?

10:38.597 --> 10:39.637
Well,

10:39.723 --> 10:43.523
at first glance, you probably wouldn't
find him all that interesting, but...

10:44.228 --> 10:45.268
He's deep.

10:46.021 --> 10:47.481
And thoughtful.

10:48.273 --> 10:51.403
The kind of person you see and think,

10:52.778 --> 10:54.358
"I just wanna be around you."

10:57.491 --> 10:58.701
Maybe I'd like him.

11:01.662 --> 11:03.912
Yeah, maybe you would.

11:07.084 --> 11:09.924
Hey, I'm really sorry,
but I actually have to run.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.133
-What's going on?
-I have to pick something up.

11:12.965 --> 11:17.085
Oh, well, I have a little time.
I could come with you.

11:19.972 --> 11:20.932
Sure.

11:21.890 --> 11:23.310
If you fancy an adventure.

11:24.725 --> 11:26.635
Miss? Your bag.

11:27.103 --> 11:30.023
Oh, uh, yeah. I'll pick it up later.

11:31.567 --> 11:32.567
[sighs]

11:32.901 --> 11:35.401
-And you say that I lie.
-It's nothing.

11:35.487 --> 11:36.987
-It's just--
-No, no, it's cool.

11:37.573 --> 11:39.783
Just a different kind of meeting.

11:50.919 --> 11:51.879
[exhales]

11:58.135 --> 11:59.335
How was the hotel?

11:59.970 --> 12:01.970
It was great.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.215
Great, thank you. Um...

12:04.933 --> 12:06.143
It was good to get away.

12:08.437 --> 12:09.397
I'm sure.

12:10.187 --> 12:12.727
Hey, Alexis.
Do you think I could pass as an architect?

12:12.815 --> 12:13.765
What?

12:13.858 --> 12:16.068
No, I mean if you met me at a bar
or something like that,

12:16.153 --> 12:17.203
would you believe that?

12:20.073 --> 12:21.373
I mean, I guess.

12:22.534 --> 12:24.834
Are you considering changing careers?

12:25.161 --> 12:26.701
Maybe in another life.

12:29.623 --> 12:31.463
I'm gonna need you
to book flights for Texas.

12:31.542 --> 12:34.382
I explained to them,
it's impossible to do this second-hand.

12:35.172 --> 12:36.882
[Alexis] I'll get on it. Who's going?

12:36.965 --> 12:39.545
It's me, you and Scott. Jeanie won't come.

12:39.635 --> 12:41.675
You'll cover for both of us,
if that's okay.

12:42.178 --> 12:43.258
Totally.

12:44.223 --> 12:45.853
Mr. Architect.

12:46.058 --> 12:47.058
[chuckles]

12:48.143 --> 12:49.103
[quietly] Yeah...

12:51.522 --> 12:54.572
I'll just be a few minutes.
You can just hang here if you want.

12:58.778 --> 13:02.158
It's way too hot in here. [exhales]

13:08.914 --> 13:09.754
[dog barks]

13:15.379 --> 13:16.549
[dog whimpers]

13:34.147 --> 13:35.397
This isn't your place.

13:36.441 --> 13:38.191
Yeah, it's Sam's.

13:40.070 --> 13:43.200
I hope you're not mad,
but Stevie's my dog, too.

13:45.909 --> 13:48.789
Well, why don't you just talk to him?
I'm sure he'll be reasonable.

13:48.871 --> 13:51.291
I literally asked to take him
for the weekend, that's it.

13:51.790 --> 13:54.670
He was being such a dick
this morning, so fuck it.

14:01.133 --> 14:02.723
[Sidney]
I'm just gonna grab his leash.

14:03.218 --> 14:04.298
Uh...

14:50.891 --> 14:52.731
God, you look so scared.

14:52.809 --> 14:54.389
How do you know he's not coming back?

14:54.476 --> 14:56.556
Sam's had the same routine forever.

14:57.564 --> 14:58.654
We're fine.

15:01.151 --> 15:05.411
[stammering]
I, uh... I'm running late, so I gotta run.

15:07.658 --> 15:09.908
Maybe we can go
to your place next time instead?

15:11.453 --> 15:12.373
Maybe.

15:13.789 --> 15:15.919
That is,
if you even have a place of your own.

15:25.717 --> 15:27.297
Shit, I'm so sorry.

15:27.386 --> 15:31.926
[sighs] Subway delays. I had to jump off
at 14th and run all the way here.

15:32.307 --> 15:34.517
-Really sorry.
-[Gary] That's okay, Jean.

15:35.102 --> 15:36.482
It's not like you to be late.

15:36.560 --> 15:37.980
I know, I'm...

15:38.063 --> 15:40.483
-I'm sorry.
-Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

15:40.566 --> 15:43.396
Oh, I uh... I kind of have a...

15:43.485 --> 15:47.105
[laughs] Yeah, I can see that.
What happened the other night?

15:47.196 --> 15:49.736
-What?
-I swear I saw you getting into your car

15:50.409 --> 15:51.949
at the rehearsal studio.

15:52.034 --> 15:54.754
Nope, I was home when you texted,
with Dolly and Michael.

15:55.414 --> 15:57.174
-You're sure?
-Yeah.

15:57.249 --> 15:58.999
Must've been my doppelgänger.

15:59.084 --> 16:02.594
Ha. Your doppelgänger drives the same car.

16:04.798 --> 16:06.468
-Claire!
-Jean.

16:06.924 --> 16:09.894
Grab your coat.
Actually, we're gonna head outside today.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.719
-We are?
-Mm-hmm.

16:11.805 --> 16:12.845
All right.

16:14.099 --> 16:15.099
[Claire] Thank you.

16:24.526 --> 16:26.816
Oh, I don't have
the right clothes for this.

16:26.904 --> 16:29.704
-It doesn't matter, today is just a trial.
-Well, I can't do this.

16:29.781 --> 16:32.241
I mean, I did yoga for a little while,
but my hamstring--

16:32.326 --> 16:33.236
It's okay.

16:33.577 --> 16:35.037
It doesn't require physical strength

16:35.119 --> 16:37.909
as much as it does
the mind's attention and focus.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.207
Are you supposed to be
taking me out of the office?

16:40.290 --> 16:43.040
Well, if I think it'll help,
it's at my discretion.

16:43.128 --> 16:45.548
Oh, my friends are gonna be hysterical

16:45.629 --> 16:47.509
when they hear I'm hanging
with my therapist...

16:47.589 --> 16:50.129
-Claire, we're not hanging.
-doing meditat--

16:50.217 --> 16:52.297
This is all part of your recovery.
Let's sit.

16:56.058 --> 16:59.098
I think Rebecca will appreciate
your being open-minded

16:59.186 --> 17:00.806
and trying something new.

17:01.230 --> 17:02.560
Maybe you should tell her.

17:03.731 --> 17:09.281
This is a meditation class focused
on letting go of anxiety...

17:09.611 --> 17:13.241
and detaching
from our inner judgmental voice.

17:13.825 --> 17:15.905
Now, please close your eyes.

17:16.954 --> 17:22.844
The world will not come to an end
because you are taking time for yourself.

17:24.502 --> 17:29.343
Notice how your breath flows in and out.

17:30.676 --> 17:33.216
We all have noise in our head.

17:33.804 --> 17:38.484
But today,
I would like you to release yourself...

17:39.560 --> 17:42.100
from the excessive thoughts,

17:42.187 --> 17:46.227
your thoughts that build up and up.

17:47.442 --> 17:53.742
So the continuous habit of thinking turns
into a worried kind of chatter.

17:54.324 --> 17:56.244
[Gary]
Though, it's not like you to be late.

17:58.161 --> 18:02.041
[instructor] There is no need
to control thoughts or thinking.

18:02.124 --> 18:04.254
[Sidney] Maybe we can go
to your place next time instead.

18:04.334 --> 18:07.634
[instructor] There is no need
to change thoughts or thinking.

18:07.713 --> 18:09.923
[Sidney] That is, if you even have
a place of your own.

18:10.007 --> 18:13.677
[instructor] Simply allow the thoughts
and observe them.

18:16.096 --> 18:20.806
By acknowledging these thoughts,
they will dissipate and fall away.

18:20.893 --> 18:21.773
Jean?

18:22.851 --> 18:25.191
[instructor]
Do not give them more power.

18:25.272 --> 18:26.152
[echoing] Jean!

18:27.022 --> 18:32.242
Where they gain power,
will become important, like a secret.

18:33.278 --> 18:35.358
[child screams]

18:35.447 --> 18:37.117
You can't catch me.

18:37.826 --> 18:39.536
You can't catch me!

18:39.828 --> 18:42.038
Oh, yes, I will catch you!

18:42.456 --> 18:44.996
Hey you! [playful growling]

18:45.083 --> 18:48.463
[Dolly] Let go! People are over.

18:50.214 --> 18:53.474
Ah, she's too old
to be wearing a boy's bathing suit.

18:53.549 --> 18:56.759
-She's tough to reason with.
-Trust me, I know.

18:56.844 --> 18:59.304
What's Sadie doing here?
I'm surprised she's allowed over.

18:59.389 --> 19:02.389
Michelle couldn't get her from Holly's,
so I said I'd drop her off.

19:02.476 --> 19:04.016
-Oh, cool.
-[Sadie] ♪ Daddy and Jacqueline ♪

19:04.102 --> 19:05.442
♪ Sitting in a tree ♪

19:05.521 --> 19:07.771
♪ K-i-s-s-i-ng ♪

19:07.856 --> 19:09.856
Hey! Who's Jacqueline?

19:10.150 --> 19:11.860
Daddy's friend. She's a waitress.

19:12.276 --> 19:13.186
Oh.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.867
You know, if Sadie was parading around
in a boy's bathing suit,

19:17.950 --> 19:19.620
Michelle would be freaking out, too.

19:20.035 --> 19:21.905
What is it that you're so afraid of?

19:22.913 --> 19:25.503
I don't know. I just don't want life
to be harder for her.

19:25.582 --> 19:26.922
[Michael] Oh, come on, honey.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Life is hard for everyone.

19:29.795 --> 19:31.085
We have to look at the big picture.

19:31.171 --> 19:34.051
We can't control
who Dolly's gonna grow up to be.

19:34.631 --> 19:36.841
Now you sound like the therapist.

19:39.513 --> 19:41.933
I don't know why I'm having
such a hard time with it.

19:43.475 --> 19:44.305
[sighs]

19:46.895 --> 19:50.145
Oh, I forgot. I've gotta go to Texas
on Thursday for two nights.

19:53.819 --> 19:55.949
-For the case?
-Yeah, it's unavoidable.

19:59.032 --> 20:00.872
It's okay. I get it.

20:02.659 --> 20:04.539
Guess you're not gonna miss me too much.

20:05.122 --> 20:06.502
We always miss you.

20:28.187 --> 20:29.607
[phone dings]

21:07.391 --> 21:10.271
I'm so fucking mad.
Like I can't control myself.

21:10.352 --> 21:11.482
Why don't you sit?

21:11.561 --> 21:15.021
I come home yesterday, and she took him.
She stole my fucking dog.

21:16.485 --> 21:18.445
-Are you sure it was her?
-Uh, yeah!

21:18.529 --> 21:20.819
She was texting me all morning
about how it was unfair.

21:20.906 --> 21:22.816
She didn't even want
the fucking dog in the end.

21:22.908 --> 21:25.948
She liked the idea of having one,
but literally never fed him or walked him.

21:26.036 --> 21:28.616
-She's the most irresponsible--
-Sam, just slow down.

21:28.704 --> 21:29.874
I-I don't know what to do!

21:29.955 --> 21:32.165
She used her old key
to break into my place.

21:32.249 --> 21:33.539
I mean, maybe I should call the police.

21:33.625 --> 21:36.915
-Sam, hold on a second--
-Who am I even protecting anymore?

21:37.004 --> 21:38.264
She thinks I'm a worthless pushover,

21:38.340 --> 21:40.220
but that's not who I'm gonna be anymore.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.970
-No one's saying you're a worthless--
-I'm sick of her controlling me,

21:43.053 --> 21:45.933
keeping me in the wings like
I'm some bullshit fan she shits all over.

21:46.014 --> 21:48.144
I'm telling you, I could fucking kill her!

21:51.562 --> 21:52.482
Sam.

21:52.896 --> 21:55.606
I have to ask,
it's part of my job to report

21:55.691 --> 21:58.441
if you're a danger to yourself
or to others.

22:05.657 --> 22:07.277
Do you really think I'm capable of that?

22:08.203 --> 22:09.873
I just need you to be honest.

22:10.622 --> 22:12.372
Even if there's an ounce of truth.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.669
I wouldn't even know how to anyway.

22:22.424 --> 22:25.054
I know you're angry,
and you have every right to be.

22:26.053 --> 22:30.313
Is it really worth getting
the police involved, all this drama,

22:30.851 --> 22:32.691
if you can't even really prove it?

22:34.271 --> 22:37.151
One of my neighbors saw Sidney
and another woman leaving.

22:39.276 --> 22:40.646
It must've been Diane.

22:41.193 --> 22:44.573
I bet it's a turn-on for her to try
to fuck a woman in her ex's apartment.

22:47.868 --> 22:49.238
And I found these.

22:53.540 --> 22:55.880
And I'm supposed to go on a date
with Emily tomorrow.

22:57.377 --> 22:58.547
To catch up.

22:59.296 --> 23:01.626
I think I'll cancel.
I'm really not in the mood.

23:09.598 --> 23:11.268
I understand you're panicking...

23:13.852 --> 23:17.902
but digging into this matter is
just another form of fixation on Sidney.

23:18.273 --> 23:20.233
Instead of it being how in love you are,

23:20.943 --> 23:23.323
you're just getting preoccupied
with the dog.

23:24.029 --> 23:27.069
When, really,
this could be a real positive.

23:27.783 --> 23:29.873
What? How?

23:30.450 --> 23:33.500
This is your chance
to break free from Sidney.

23:34.748 --> 23:36.788
Now, I know how much you love Stevie,

23:36.875 --> 23:39.915
but that dog is just a reminder
of the heartache.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.132
It's impossible for you to move on.

23:43.549 --> 23:48.009
Don't cancel your date with Emily.
In fact, this is great timing.

23:48.095 --> 23:52.345
Go out. Have fun and see for yourself.

23:53.016 --> 23:55.766
You don't need Sidney to make you happy.

24:02.442 --> 24:03.442
Hey.

24:05.195 --> 24:06.105
Come here.

24:23.463 --> 24:25.473
[phone ringing]

24:32.806 --> 24:33.926
Um, Lex?

24:35.601 --> 24:36.601
Alexis?

24:44.193 --> 24:46.783
-I hope you didn't think it was cheesy.
-Not at all.

24:47.362 --> 24:50.032
Is that true about your father?

24:51.366 --> 24:53.736
Unfortunately, yeah.

24:54.951 --> 24:57.411
-Ooh.
-We're all set for Texas, by the way.

24:58.373 --> 25:01.463
They didn't have any high-end hotels,
so I booked the closest thing.

25:01.541 --> 25:04.921
Kinda like a Holiday Inn,
so don't get too excited.

25:05.506 --> 25:06.586
No, that sounds great.

25:07.090 --> 25:09.180
Oh, um, thank you for reading.

25:09.801 --> 25:10.931
Means a lot.

25:13.470 --> 25:18.310
[woman] Logan's been coming home crying
about how Spencer told him

25:18.393 --> 25:20.353
that he can't be a part
of the Super Boys Club

25:20.437 --> 25:23.317
unless he starts to dress
and act like the other boys.

25:23.398 --> 25:27.488
Spencer made him eat sand the other day
to prove that he's worthy.

25:28.111 --> 25:32.821
They also compared penis sizes
to determine who could join.

25:32.906 --> 25:36.156
I mean, they're eight.
It sounds like a fraternity!

25:36.243 --> 25:38.833
I'm sorry, but I can't tell Spencer
who to be friends with.

25:38.912 --> 25:42.082
[woman] Well, you have to talk to him
about not forcing other kids

25:42.165 --> 25:43.915
to do things that are dangerous.

25:44.002 --> 25:46.842
Lindsay, have you spoken to Spencer
about disbanding this group?

25:46.922 --> 25:49.172
They'll just find another way
to choose their friends.

25:49.633 --> 25:51.553
We all know kids are tough at this age.

25:51.635 --> 25:54.135
Sorry, can I interject here?

25:55.681 --> 25:58.891
Modeling's a huge way
that kids learn to be social.

25:59.226 --> 26:02.856
I mean, there are clear lines
being drawn, even here.

26:02.936 --> 26:04.596
Jean, could you speak more to that?

26:05.023 --> 26:08.863
Well, the truth is, bully or victim,
the feeling's just the same.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.358
It's insecurity and fear.

26:12.239 --> 26:14.909
And we've all got things
to be vulnerable about.

26:14.992 --> 26:16.872
Fears of losing something,

26:16.952 --> 26:19.662
whether it's your best friend
dropping you for the new kid,

26:19.746 --> 26:20.996
or your husband...

26:21.580 --> 26:23.370
having an affair with the waitress.

26:24.293 --> 26:27.423
So, why don't we just be
a little bit more compassionate here

26:27.502 --> 26:28.502
and less judgmental?

26:29.464 --> 26:33.644
And maybe you should get
Logan and Spencer together for a playdate.

26:33.719 --> 26:34.549
I mean, who knows?

26:34.636 --> 26:39.056
That level of animosity might mean
they actually could be great friends.

26:39.892 --> 26:41.692
I think that's pretty sound advice.

26:42.436 --> 26:43.936
Lindsay, are you open to that?

27:10.631 --> 27:13.051
-Oh, hey, honey.
-Hey there, hey.

27:13.217 --> 27:16.137
-How was the PTA meeting?
-I killed it.

27:16.553 --> 27:19.353
Oh, really? Look at you, power mom.

27:19.431 --> 27:22.771
-I know, right?
-My, my, my.

27:22.851 --> 27:24.901
All we have to do
is get Dolly signed up for soccer

27:24.978 --> 27:26.808
and then you'll be a real soccer mom.

27:26.897 --> 27:28.357
[Jean laughs]

27:29.983 --> 27:31.993
-How was your day?
-You know, whatever.

27:36.949 --> 27:37.869
Coming up?

27:40.744 --> 27:41.584
Yeah.

27:51.046 --> 27:52.666
-Mommy!
-Hey.

27:55.092 --> 27:59.052
-I learned how to crow.
-You did? Let me hear it.

28:00.305 --> 28:01.765
[mimics rooster]

28:01.849 --> 28:03.639
[laughing] Oh, my God.

28:04.601 --> 28:05.731
That's incredible.

28:07.271 --> 28:09.191
And Sadie's gonna be Tinkerbell.

28:09.982 --> 28:14.532
Oh, well, I think you would be
the perfect Peter Pan.

28:16.280 --> 28:17.320
Hey, Sweetie.

28:19.199 --> 28:21.579
Do you wanna be part
of the Super Boys Club?

28:23.912 --> 28:26.252
No. I think it's stupid.

28:30.210 --> 28:31.130
You're right.

28:33.169 --> 28:35.959
I think it's pretty stupid, too.
[chuckles]

28:40.512 --> 28:43.022
-[Jean] I love you.
-I love you, too.

29:01.074 --> 29:04.164
[Jean] So, I just got done
playing my show at Rockwood,

29:05.871 --> 29:10.791
and, uh, someone mentioned that
you were waiting backstage for me.

29:29.645 --> 29:31.185
Hi, Paul. It's Jean.

29:31.271 --> 29:35.941
Listen. I have to be away
on Thursday and Friday,

29:36.026 --> 29:38.776
so, unfortunately,
I'm gonna have to reschedule.

29:39.154 --> 29:42.374
So, can you call me back
when you have a chance? Thank you, bye.

29:45.369 --> 29:46.329
[Larin] Hey, you.

29:46.411 --> 29:49.671
Oh, hey. Sorry, I was just
rescheduling an appointment.

29:49.748 --> 29:50.958
Are you guys going away?

29:51.041 --> 29:52.581
-I'll have some.
-Um, yeah...

29:52.918 --> 29:53.918
I--

29:54.378 --> 29:57.208
No. Michael has to be in Texas for work,

29:57.297 --> 30:01.087
-so I figured I'd just hang with Dolly.
-Oh, thank you.

30:02.553 --> 30:06.973
So, apparently,
Darrell has a new girlfriend.

30:07.933 --> 30:10.273
I think she's like 14 or something.

30:11.645 --> 30:14.305
-Or like 29, but still, man, it's...
-God.

30:15.315 --> 30:17.775
-Michael mentioned she was younger, but--
-Wait...

30:18.485 --> 30:19.735
You guys knew?

30:20.195 --> 30:21.275
Well, no.

30:21.864 --> 30:24.534
He just said that Darrell was texting
with someone and--

30:24.616 --> 30:26.866
Jean, if it was reversed,

30:26.952 --> 30:31.002
[stammering] I would've called you.
I would've called you immediately.

30:31.081 --> 30:33.131
You're right. I was preoccupied. I'm--

30:33.206 --> 30:35.826
-It's just a pretty big thing to forget.
-I know, I'm sorry.

30:35.917 --> 30:38.587
Hey, I'd love to get your guys' opinion
on this situation.

30:38.672 --> 30:40.092
-What's up?
-Whose?

30:40.174 --> 30:41.184
My cheater.

30:41.550 --> 30:43.300
Oh, I have your notes on Allison,
by the way.

30:43.385 --> 30:45.465
-Oh, great, thanks.
-Thank you.

30:46.471 --> 30:48.931
I now think there's a lot more
to the story.

30:49.349 --> 30:50.679
I think he could be a sociopath.

30:50.767 --> 30:52.687
I hate when people throw that word around.

30:52.767 --> 30:55.347
Yeah, but if the shoe fits...

30:56.565 --> 30:58.815
[Hunter] In his case, it might be true.

30:59.860 --> 31:02.070
He told me
he sees a blind man in the street

31:02.154 --> 31:04.164
and enjoys watching him struggle.

31:04.990 --> 31:07.240
Had to teach himself
to pretend to feel things.

31:07.409 --> 31:08.739
Those are pretty big signs.

31:08.827 --> 31:10.907
I wouldn't be so quick to label.

31:10.994 --> 31:16.084
No, because you think all people exist
in a gray area. Don't you?

31:16.165 --> 31:19.625
No, I just think,
given we're professionals,

31:19.713 --> 31:21.423
we should reserve judgment.

31:22.758 --> 31:27.218
Well, what's even more intriguing is
he tries to manipulate me.

31:27.554 --> 31:28.474
How so?

31:28.555 --> 31:30.845
Well, like when he told me
about cheating on his fiancée.

31:30.930 --> 31:33.310
But I later found out
he's been cheating for years.

31:33.391 --> 31:35.601
Maybe he's just not ready to face it yet.

31:35.685 --> 31:39.145
I don't know. I think people need
to own their circumstance,

31:39.233 --> 31:42.823
and it's actually our job
to hold them accountable.

31:43.487 --> 31:46.617
Right, but you can't force
a patient to be...

31:47.491 --> 31:49.201
truthful with himself.

31:49.701 --> 31:51.751
Or anyone, if they're not ready.

31:51.828 --> 31:55.788
I think you're underestimating
the importance of honesty.

32:04.716 --> 32:06.926
[bubbling]

32:10.681 --> 32:11.641
Hi.

32:15.018 --> 32:16.098
Happy to see me?

32:18.730 --> 32:19.650
How can I help?

32:20.229 --> 32:21.359
What?

32:22.192 --> 32:24.192
What, your colleagues don't know
you make house calls?

32:24.278 --> 32:27.068
-That was extenuating circumstances.
-So what's the problem?

32:27.614 --> 32:28.664
What do you want?

32:30.073 --> 32:30.913
[Allison] Jean.

32:32.494 --> 32:34.044
Sorry, I...

32:37.583 --> 32:38.633
Let's begin.

32:54.725 --> 32:55.675
[Allison] It's my fault.

32:55.767 --> 32:57.977
I said I wouldn't talk to him
unless it was in front of you.

32:59.146 --> 33:01.316
[Tom]
I'm confused why you're seeing her at all.

33:02.316 --> 33:03.776
You know, my buddy's a shrink.

33:04.985 --> 33:08.025
-He sends his addicts to rehab.
-I'm not an addict anymore.

33:08.989 --> 33:10.069
She still uses.

33:11.408 --> 33:14.328
I thought you came here to try
and win me back, not be an asshole.

33:15.954 --> 33:17.374
Why are you here, Tom?

33:19.333 --> 33:20.543
She just told you.

33:22.878 --> 33:26.758
She won't see me... without you here.

33:29.927 --> 33:31.177
I guess she's scared.

33:46.485 --> 33:48.195
Not normally big on therapy.

33:51.240 --> 33:53.410
I mean, you're the ones
that are more fucked up than me.

33:54.618 --> 33:57.448
If you're gonna be disrespectful,
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

34:00.038 --> 34:00.958
Tom.

34:02.668 --> 34:03.668
I'm sorry.

34:04.500 --> 34:05.880
I, uh--

34:05.960 --> 34:07.880
You know, I act out when I'm angry.

34:11.467 --> 34:12.638
You should be with me.

34:13.762 --> 34:16.141
I mean, you know that, don't you?

34:17.306 --> 34:18.137
Baby...

34:22.896 --> 34:24.016
Hey...

34:24.106 --> 34:25.646
I won't get all crazy.

34:27.192 --> 34:28.782
Just come home already.

34:31.655 --> 34:32.735
I miss you.

34:34.533 --> 34:36.123
You know how good we can be together.

34:37.619 --> 34:39.449
Allison, where are you living right now?

34:40.038 --> 34:41.538
At a friend's on her couch.

34:43.542 --> 34:44.922
Amber's a crackhead.

34:45.585 --> 34:46.916
She's not a good influence.

34:48.005 --> 34:49.005
And you are?

34:53.092 --> 34:57.143
You're an adult, Allison,
and you can make your own decisions.

35:04.563 --> 35:06.323
I don't think you're good for me.

35:09.318 --> 35:10.688
[scoffs] Baby--

35:10.777 --> 35:12.357
I don't think you're good for me.

35:12.571 --> 35:14.241
-Hey.
-You heard her.

35:17.326 --> 35:18.656
I think you should leave.

35:20.621 --> 35:22.121
Are you okay with that, Allison?

35:33.634 --> 35:36.394
Fucking joke, the both of you.

35:37.385 --> 35:38.965
You think she cares about you?

35:40.474 --> 35:43.694
I'm the only one who actually
gives a shit about you.

35:44.394 --> 35:47.864
-Not your mom, not her!
-Okay, Tom...

35:55.697 --> 35:59.197
And you? You're gonna get
what's coming to you, lady.

36:00.244 --> 36:01.794
Just hope you enjoy the ride.

36:56.008 --> 36:57.548
[Alexis] Michael Holloway's office.

36:57.634 --> 36:59.554
Hi, Alexis. It's Jean. How are you?

36:59.636 --> 37:02.966
I'm good.
He's actually still in with Allen.

37:03.056 --> 37:05.136
Ah, okay, um...

37:06.643 --> 37:09.813
Well, if he can't reach me,
tell him I'll be home after dinner.

37:10.522 --> 37:13.572
-I'm just going into another session.
-Cool, I will.

37:13.650 --> 37:15.690
Okay, great. Thanks.

37:22.075 --> 37:25.365
[Sam]
Is this weird? I hope this isn't weird.

37:25.454 --> 37:28.674
Honestly, I was a little surprised
that you wanted to meet up.

37:29.333 --> 37:30.173
Why?

37:31.084 --> 37:33.964
'Cause you and Sid, like,
fell off the face of the Earth

37:34.046 --> 37:35.046
when you ran off together.

37:35.130 --> 37:37.170
We didn't--
I mean, we didn't run off together.

37:38.133 --> 37:39.133
Whatever.

37:44.723 --> 37:47.233
I just feel like
I'm finally getting my life in order,

37:47.309 --> 37:49.059
and you were really important to me.

37:51.688 --> 37:52.648
Yeah, me too.

37:57.110 --> 37:59.740
So, what happened with Sidney?

38:00.072 --> 38:01.822
I mean,
you didn't tell me the other night.

38:02.115 --> 38:03.445
Oh, um...

38:07.412 --> 38:09.042
We were ultimately just too different.

38:10.415 --> 38:11.325
That's all.

38:12.832 --> 38:16.042
It's hard to understand the full story
from the outside, you know?

38:17.089 --> 38:20.429
I mean, if you're gonna be a barista
into your late 20s...

38:21.260 --> 38:22.760
it's just not cool.

38:22.845 --> 38:24.345
I mean, she's still pursuing music.

38:24.429 --> 38:26.599
Oh, come on. She's never gonna be
smart enough for you.

38:29.309 --> 38:31.559
I don't mean to be rude, but...

38:34.314 --> 38:36.284
she really fucked me over.

38:38.357 --> 38:39.777
You did, too.

38:43.365 --> 38:45.115
But I have made amends.

38:46.660 --> 38:47.660
I just...

38:50.622 --> 38:51.712
I think that...

38:53.039 --> 38:54.669
she just sucked you in.

38:56.295 --> 38:59.585
She's bewitching,
but she'll fuck you over...

39:01.216 --> 39:02.886
when she's on her next obsession.

39:06.722 --> 39:07.562
[elevator bell rings]

39:12.477 --> 39:15.017
Can't believe you left work
in the middle of your shift.

39:15.105 --> 39:18.895
Oh, whatever. You don't think
it's my dream to be a barista forever.

39:18.984 --> 39:19.824
[chuckles]

39:19.902 --> 39:21.902
As long as I can make rent, I'm fine.

39:23.697 --> 39:27.277
Plus, I have this demo thing which might
actually be the thing that takes off.

39:28.994 --> 39:30.664
And what about your future?

39:31.705 --> 39:33.955
-What do you mean?
-Well...

39:34.791 --> 39:38.091
If things don't work out with music,
what's your backup plan?

39:38.837 --> 39:40.707
Well, you can't plan for the future,

39:40.797 --> 39:42.877
'cause you don't know
what the future holds.

39:44.298 --> 39:48.088
Unless you have some crystal ball you've
been hiding somewhere I don't know about.

39:48.177 --> 39:51.387
-[Sidney laughs]
-That's not how people live.

39:51.475 --> 39:52.765
I mean, sure, plans change,

39:52.851 --> 39:55.601
but you have to have
some kind of direction, right?

39:55.687 --> 39:58.567
Planning's a code
for making people feel safe.

39:59.358 --> 40:00.688
It's not certain.

40:01.985 --> 40:05.275
Nothing's certain, except for
whatever's happening right here.

40:06.573 --> 40:07.663
In this moment.

40:20.796 --> 40:23.006
That is real.

40:24.716 --> 40:26.586
It's a tempting way to live.

40:27.594 --> 40:29.144
It's the only way to live.

40:29.221 --> 40:30.721
[both laugh]

40:32.349 --> 40:34.979
Well, you don't have responsibilities.

40:35.060 --> 40:36.480
-Like what?
-I don't know.

40:36.562 --> 40:41.022
House, kids, things that make you
settle down, be an adult.

40:41.105 --> 40:43.065
Do you have those things?

40:44.900 --> 40:47.780
I mean, you say all this like
you're living some encumbered life.

40:49.157 --> 40:51.367
Your stories don't exactly track, Diane.

40:52.536 --> 40:57.456
I mean, you're a single woman
in your 40s, I presume,

40:58.375 --> 40:59.875
who works freelance.

41:00.544 --> 41:03.264
You should feel completely free.

41:04.590 --> 41:07.970
Well, I guess I just live according
to how I think I...

41:09.011 --> 41:09.851
should.

41:10.429 --> 41:12.389
Well, stop.

41:12.472 --> 41:15.602
Stop thinking about
what everyone else wants for you.

41:17.895 --> 41:19.975
'Cause, eventually, they'll all fuck off.

41:21.520 --> 41:22.940
And all you'll be left with...

41:23.984 --> 41:25.824
is whether you were true to yourself.

41:35.495 --> 41:39.165
-[chuckles] Don't stop on my account.
-Oh, no. No, it's okay.

41:40.834 --> 41:44.254
You on, like, Tinder or Hinge or anything?

41:44.338 --> 41:45.508
No, um...

41:46.340 --> 41:49.510
I'm actually not trying
to jump into anything at the moment.

41:49.927 --> 41:50.837
Hmm.

41:55.054 --> 41:57.774
I'm actually texting my therapist,
since you seem so curious.

41:58.268 --> 41:59.518
You see a therapist?

42:00.687 --> 42:01.977
That seems so unlike you.

42:02.064 --> 42:05.284
[chuckles] Yeah, I know right?
Well, she's actually been...

42:06.610 --> 42:08.490
really helpful through this breakup.

42:09.071 --> 42:10.071
Feels like...

42:10.948 --> 42:14.408
it would've been
too touchy-feely for you before.

42:14.493 --> 42:15.703
Jean's different.

42:16.703 --> 42:18.913
I mean,
she makes it enjoyable. She's, uh...

42:20.415 --> 42:21.995
She's normal, like us, you know?

42:24.586 --> 42:25.586
Is she cute?

42:25.671 --> 42:27.131
Oh, what? You're jealous now?

42:27.214 --> 42:29.634
-Please.
-I'm just curious.

42:29.883 --> 42:31.513
I know you like those authority figures.

42:31.593 --> 42:34.263
Actually, she's pretty.

42:34.888 --> 42:37.178
-Really pretty.
-You are totally into her!

42:37.266 --> 42:38.096
[Emily scoffs]

42:38.809 --> 42:40.939
[sighs]
Jealousy's never been my strong suit.

42:41.016 --> 42:41.846
Oh, I remember.

42:41.934 --> 42:44.654
In Costa Rica, you got in a fight
with that random woman who was

42:44.731 --> 42:47.651
-showing us around the coffee plantation.
-You were totally flirting with her!

42:47.734 --> 42:49.864
-I was scared for my life.
-Shut up!

42:49.945 --> 42:52.655
Oh, my God. [laughs]

42:57.786 --> 42:59.496
Whoa. Hey, are you okay?

42:59.580 --> 43:02.540
-[labored breathing] Oh, God.
-Okay, whoa. Okay, just stand here a sec.

43:02.624 --> 43:03.634
Okay.

43:04.665 --> 43:06.245
-You all right?
-[Jean] I don't know.

43:06.962 --> 43:10.972
-I just feel dizzy, sorry.
-Okay, hey, can you walk?

43:11.425 --> 43:14.045
Okay, we're just gonna
walk right over here. Yeah?

43:14.136 --> 43:17.136
-I don't know what's happening.
-Sit right here. Right here. There we go.

43:17.973 --> 43:19.563
-Okay, okay.
-I'm sorry.

43:19.641 --> 43:21.351
It's okay, okay? Just breathe, it's fine.

43:21.435 --> 43:23.185
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine. I got you.

43:23.770 --> 43:25.560
Just breathe, okay?

43:26.982 --> 43:30.112
-I don't know what's going on.
-It's okay. Just take a minute, yeah?

43:30.444 --> 43:31.744
[deep breaths]

43:33.739 --> 43:34.819
Who's that?

43:36.033 --> 43:37.033
[Sidney] Who?

43:39.161 --> 43:40.541
-Diane? Look at me.
-Oh, God.

43:40.621 --> 43:43.081
Okay, whoa.
Okay, should I take you to a hospital?

43:43.165 --> 43:45.205
-No. No, I'm fine.
-Okay.

43:45.876 --> 43:49.246
I just... I don't... Just need a second...

43:49.338 --> 43:51.668
It's fine. Take all the time, yeah?

43:53.467 --> 43:55.297
Shh...

43:57.346 --> 44:00.136
-It's Tom.
-What?

44:00.474 --> 44:03.944
Tom. He must've... I don't know, I just...

44:04.019 --> 44:05.849
Okay, just rest a second, okay?

44:05.938 --> 44:06.858
[Jean groans]

44:06.939 --> 44:09.359
Okay, breathe. It's okay.

44:09.441 --> 44:10.821
-You're fine.
-Oh, God.

44:11.401 --> 44:13.951
-I'm scared.
-Don't be scared. It's fine.

44:14.404 --> 44:15.664
It's fine. I'm here.

44:16.820 --> 44:18.950
-It's fine.
-[panting]

44:21.659 --> 44:23.989
Can you-- Could you call--

44:26.959 --> 44:28.339
Call Michael, please...

44:28.418 --> 44:30.548
-Who's Michael?
-and tell him I'm gonna be late.

44:32.089 --> 44:34.929
Um, all right, well,
what's your passcode, Diane?

44:36.635 --> 44:37.635
Diane?

44:38.095 --> 44:39.175
I forget...

44:39.972 --> 44:41.772
Three, six...

44:42.516 --> 44:45.476
Okay, kid.
Just rest and relax a sec, okay?

44:45.936 --> 44:47.476
I'll call later, okay?

44:47.938 --> 44:50.728
It's fine. It's fine, okay?
