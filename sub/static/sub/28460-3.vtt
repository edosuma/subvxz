<font color=#FFFF00>Story One:
Broken Mom-Mom</font>

00:08.437 --> 00:10.125
How's your knee
feeling, Joanie?

00:10.213 --> 00:13.129
The doc seemed pretty confident
when he said one week.

00:13.361 --> 00:15.319
But, y-you know,
you got to get out of bed,

00:15.406 --> 00:17.017
put some weight on it. Here.

00:17.104 --> 00:20.542
No. I don't trust that doctor.
He wore jeans.

00:20.629 --> 00:22.283
Hmm.

00:22.370 --> 00:24.732
Wait, don't go. Don't go.

00:24.950 --> 00:27.487
Oh, I'm so bored.

00:27.575 --> 00:29.519
Well, geez,
I'd love to hang out,

00:29.607 --> 00:32.206
but, uh, I got an appointment
I cannot break.

00:32.380 --> 00:33.520
With whom?

00:33.638 --> 00:35.841
Whoever they pair me up with.

00:42.472 --> 00:44.529
Hey, Mom-Mom.

00:44.617 --> 00:48.779
Sophia. You came to see
the Mom-Mom you love.

00:48.867 --> 00:50.390
Oh, I'm just delivering
a sandwich.

00:50.478 --> 00:55.005
No, no, no. You want to talk
and tell me all your problems.

00:55.333 --> 00:58.362
Perhaps, uh, you're feeling
invisible at school?

00:58.449 --> 01:01.878
No, school's great. I just got
to name our new mascot,

01:01.966 --> 01:04.888
Inclusive the Rainbow.Oh.

01:05.281 --> 01:08.081
I guess I did just get kind of
annoyed with my mom, though.

01:08.169 --> 01:11.450
Oh, wonderful. Tell me, honey.
Sit down, tell me.

01:11.549 --> 01:13.036
I wanted her to play a game,

01:13.124 --> 01:16.448
but she said she's too exhausted
from taking care of you

01:16.536 --> 01:18.434
and listening to all
your complaints and demands.

01:18.521 --> 01:19.542
Hmm. Well, you know,

01:19.630 --> 01:21.044
I gave her 40 years,

01:21.132 --> 01:22.960
and she walked some toast
across the street,

01:23.048 --> 01:24.005
so I guess we're even.

01:24.093 --> 01:26.833
She said you owe her.
Later.

01:27.168 --> 01:29.964
Whoa, honey,
don't leave me, please.

01:30.052 --> 01:31.982
You know, I can play
that game with you.

01:32.070 --> 01:33.279
Really?

01:34.968 --> 01:37.797
I didn't know there was a truth
or dare version of this game.

01:38.064 --> 01:40.378
There's also an X-rated version
of Monopoly.

01:40.466 --> 01:42.620
I found it
in Mom and Dad's closet.

01:42.708 --> 01:44.825
Instead of a car,
there were handcuffs.

01:44.913 --> 01:46.318
Instead of a thimble,
there was some...

01:46.405 --> 01:48.786
Um, no, honey.
I-I understand what you mean.

01:48.874 --> 01:52.026
Okay, so, "Dare one player
to run around the room."

01:52.114 --> 01:53.286
I dare you.

01:53.374 --> 01:56.458
Run? Get a grip.
I can't even walk.

01:56.546 --> 01:58.333
Then I dare you
to prank call someone.

01:58.421 --> 01:59.640
I don't know, not with me.

01:59.815 --> 02:01.802
I'm not funny that way.

02:02.536 --> 02:05.005
Seymour Butts doesn't live here.

02:05.093 --> 02:06.482
Okay? Who is this?

02:06.584 --> 02:08.566
You know what?
You are a little piece of...

02:08.654 --> 02:10.622
Oh, mercy.

02:10.723 --> 02:12.567
Oh, that was upsetting.

02:12.654 --> 02:13.974
I'm gonna go get
some more games.

02:14.062 --> 02:14.974
What?

02:15.062 --> 02:18.482
I love having a broken Mom-Mom
who can't leave her bed.

02:21.685 --> 02:23.018
One...

02:23.106 --> 02:24.161
two...

02:24.249 --> 02:26.568
Oh, phew.

02:28.865 --> 02:32.021
Four?
That's too many.

02:35.882 --> 02:36.904
Can we get out yet?

02:36.992 --> 02:38.635
I'm a little starved for air.

02:38.723 --> 02:41.425
We all are.
It's a nuclear holocaust.

02:41.513 --> 02:43.193
Mm, right. But I...

02:43.396 --> 02:44.950
Are you crazy?

02:45.038 --> 02:47.297
Mom-Mom,
it isn't safe.

02:47.384 --> 02:49.513
Get back in the fort now.

02:49.746 --> 02:51.387
Wake up, Mom-Mom.

02:51.825 --> 02:53.052
What's happening?

02:53.140 --> 02:54.997
I'm the wicked stepmother.

02:55.305 --> 02:57.351
You're gonna have
to eat your way out.

02:57.761 --> 02:59.482
- Hey, Mom.
- Ooh.

02:59.570 --> 03:02.130
A visitor.
I'm up here!

03:02.218 --> 03:04.394
Shh. You need your rest.

03:04.560 --> 03:07.317
- I'll take care of it.
- Honey?

03:08.616 --> 03:11.529
Oh! Hey, uh, Soph.
Th-This is for Mom-Mom.

03:11.713 --> 03:13.654
Oh, okay.
She's not taking

03:13.742 --> 03:15.302
visitors right now.
She's resting.

03:15.390 --> 03:17.935
Uh, somebody's out there.
I can hear you.

03:18.052 --> 03:19.607
Hello?

03:22.220 --> 03:24.222
Did you call Uncle Greg?

03:24.693 --> 03:26.641
No, I didn't.

03:26.904 --> 03:28.643
I'll just hold onto this.

03:28.730 --> 03:30.688
Anything you need,
I'll get you.

03:30.776 --> 03:32.806
Well, would you untie me,
please?

03:32.894 --> 03:37.749
No. I've got other
plans for you.

03:37.837 --> 03:39.456
We're gonna smash geodes.

03:39.654 --> 03:43.050
No, we're not.
I have had enough of this.

03:43.144 --> 03:45.573
Just untie me!

03:46.433 --> 03:49.120
I thought we were
having fun together.

03:50.214 --> 03:51.847
Oh, darling.

03:52.330 --> 03:54.292
I didn't want to do that.

03:54.480 --> 03:55.862
I'm so sorry.

03:55.995 --> 04:00.105
You've been just so...
you've been so wonderful to me.

04:00.347 --> 04:02.677
Honey, I'm so sorry.

04:02.764 --> 04:04.011
I'll tell you what.

04:04.099 --> 04:05.548
You know, you go home,

04:05.636 --> 04:08.813
and you just get us
some more games, okay?

04:08.971 --> 04:10.308
I've got a really fun one

04:10.396 --> 04:13.181
where the loser gets their
fingers electrocuted.

04:13.501 --> 04:14.720
Brilliant.

04:36.856 --> 04:38.715
Mom-Mom, you're walking?

04:39.085 --> 04:40.582
Now we can play Twister.

04:43.581 --> 04:45.581
<font color=#FFFF00>Story Two:
Birth Mama Drama</font>

04:45.807 --> 04:47.784
So, we were thinking of
having the whole family over

04:47.871 --> 04:50.528
to our house, uh, to meet
our birth mother, Morgan.

04:50.645 --> 04:51.916
She's coming to live with us

04:52.004 --> 04:53.989
to ride out
the rest of her pregnancy.

04:54.129 --> 04:56.731
So, when do we get
to meet this baby mule?

04:57.036 --> 04:59.619
Friday. And, um, that's
the type of thing

04:59.707 --> 05:01.299
that you can't call her,

05:01.387 --> 05:04.127
because she might change her
mind about giving us her baby.

05:04.215 --> 05:08.315
Oh.Honey, that's the best version
of what he was going to say.

05:11.020 --> 05:12.332
To dear Morgan.

05:12.420 --> 05:16.002
We're so honored
that you've chosen our family

05:16.090 --> 05:17.865
to give this precious gift to.

05:17.952 --> 05:21.153
- And... Colleen and Matt...
- Hello? Hey.

05:21.364 --> 05:23.073
Hey, you can keep talking.
It's fine.

05:23.161 --> 05:24.559
Oh, well...

05:24.647 --> 05:26.385
I'm so glad
you called. I'm, like,

05:26.473 --> 05:28.908
literally having
the most awkward conversation

05:28.996 --> 05:30.237
with this old lady right now.

05:30.325 --> 05:32.612
I don't know.
Like, old. Like, 50?

05:32.755 --> 05:33.938
You know what, this
might be, like,

05:34.025 --> 05:35.227
a dying words type of thing,

05:35.315 --> 05:36.556
so I'm gonna
call you back later.

05:36.643 --> 05:38.666
Okay, bye. Go on.

05:40.369 --> 05:43.127
- Beautiful toast, Mom.
- Thank you so much.

05:46.025 --> 05:47.521
Oh, God.

05:47.608 --> 05:50.336
This party blows.
We should totally ditch.

05:50.424 --> 05:52.148
I don't even know anyone here.

05:52.236 --> 05:53.937
I think that's
kind of the point.

05:54.025 --> 05:55.250
Thanks, professor.

05:55.338 --> 05:56.906
But you know what,
I did find one person

05:56.994 --> 05:59.016
that I kind of connected with.

05:59.104 --> 06:01.463
Yeah, my husband
is already connected.

06:01.551 --> 06:03.979
Clem, stop.
It's not a good color on you.

06:04.386 --> 06:06.416
You know what'd be a
good color on me?

06:07.049 --> 06:08.354
Red.

06:09.795 --> 06:11.619
She is not even my type.

06:12.945 --> 06:15.854
You know what?
You two look like twins.

06:20.150 --> 06:24.203
Being pregnant is the worst,
but it's also kind of the best.

06:24.291 --> 06:26.473
Right?
Now I can eat what I want,

06:26.560 --> 06:28.047
and I got to drop out
of high school,

06:28.135 --> 06:29.690
and all my sex is safe.

06:29.778 --> 06:31.072
Well, for the next
couple months.

06:31.160 --> 06:32.377
Yeah. Uh...

06:32.544 --> 06:33.980
Oh. Okay.

06:34.153 --> 06:37.039
I was gonna go,
but then she did.

06:37.127 --> 06:38.485
So...

06:38.869 --> 06:39.992
I feel like I can still go.

06:40.080 --> 06:41.354
Yeah, you can go.

06:42.072 --> 06:43.403
Bitch.

06:45.205 --> 06:46.883
Morgan is a nightmare.

06:46.971 --> 06:48.290
She can't talk
to my family this way.

06:48.377 --> 06:49.299
I need to say something.

06:49.387 --> 06:50.799
No, no, no. No,
don't you dare.

06:51.018 --> 06:52.703
We can't afford
to lose her, Matt.

06:52.791 --> 06:54.399
Besides, if she's not attacking
your family,

06:54.486 --> 06:56.070
she's attacking us,
and I need a break.

06:56.158 --> 06:57.617
Honey, she told Greg
she could tell

06:57.705 --> 06:58.735
his hair is dried
with a hairdryer,

06:58.822 --> 07:00.386
and that's not something
that he wants out.

07:00.473 --> 07:01.549
Well, what do you care?

07:01.637 --> 07:03.449
You've been wanting
to expose that for years.

07:03.537 --> 07:06.322
Yes, in a slow, like,
organized social media rollout

07:06.410 --> 07:07.818
that I control.
That I control. Well,

07:07.905 --> 07:10.361
you don't control her, Matt.
You don't control anything.

07:10.449 --> 07:12.432
Haven't the last two
years taught you that?

07:15.706 --> 07:16.633
What are you all doing

07:16.721 --> 07:17.767
- in here?
- Shh!

07:17.855 --> 07:20.628
We're hiding
from Morgan. Shut the door.Shh.

07:21.301 --> 07:24.027
If you actually have to use the
bathroom, use the kitchen sink.

07:25.270 --> 07:27.877
Well, it's just never easy

07:27.965 --> 07:30.189
the first time
you're called a bitch.

07:30.277 --> 07:31.929
Uh, wait, what happened?

07:32.016 --> 07:34.250
Did Morgan call
you the B-word?

07:34.338 --> 07:35.566
Mm-hmm.

07:36.449 --> 07:38.517
I guess I always knew
it was coming.

07:38.605 --> 07:40.506
I just thought
I had a couple more years

07:40.594 --> 07:42.379
to be a kid, you know?

07:42.897 --> 07:44.564
I'm just gonna go sit around

07:44.652 --> 07:46.058
and wait for my period.

07:46.609 --> 07:48.378
Aw.

07:50.206 --> 07:51.925
You all should be
at the party,

07:52.027 --> 07:53.734
you know,
supporting Matt and Colleen.

07:53.969 --> 07:55.306
We support them in theory.

07:55.394 --> 07:57.607
But, in practice,
we don't want to.

07:57.802 --> 07:59.524
Yeah, Morgan's so mean.

07:59.612 --> 08:01.127
If Tim heard the things
she said about him,

08:01.214 --> 08:03.011
he'd drive his car
straight into the ocean.

08:03.104 --> 08:05.484
Was it about my weight?
Ha-ha. Very original.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.791
No, it wasn't
about your weight.

08:08.308 --> 08:09.933
Oh, no.

08:10.808 --> 08:12.376
Oh, babe, no. That's
potpourri, honey.

08:12.464 --> 08:14.057
- I don't even care.
- Listen up.

08:14.145 --> 08:16.713
We got to support
Matt and Colleen.

08:16.823 --> 08:19.399
I mean, th-they're looking
like exhausted parents

08:19.487 --> 08:21.136
and they don't
even have a kid yet.

08:21.224 --> 08:23.142
Yeah, Morgan called them gunty,

08:23.230 --> 08:24.765
which cannot be good.

08:24.917 --> 08:27.799
That is not nearly as bad
as what she said about Tim.

08:27.924 --> 08:29.196
Come after the dome?

08:29.284 --> 08:30.799
Oh, very clever.

08:30.981 --> 08:32.111
No.

08:32.400 --> 08:33.682
Oh, no.

08:33.775 --> 08:35.219
We got six weeks

08:35.307 --> 08:36.890
and they'll get that baby.

08:36.979 --> 08:38.166
In the meantime,

08:38.260 --> 08:40.900
you all got to put up
with that turd's crap.

08:41.866 --> 08:43.215
Wait.

08:45.655 --> 08:47.940
So it's believable.

08:50.791 --> 08:52.961
There is no excuse
for Morgan's behavior.

08:53.049 --> 08:54.577
We can't put your family
through this.

08:54.664 --> 08:57.352
No. So, our options are,

08:57.440 --> 09:01.088
uh, either we confront her
and risk losing the baby...

09:01.932 --> 09:04.368
...or we just put
our heads down

09:04.456 --> 09:05.916
and we deal with it.

09:07.409 --> 09:08.896
She's our problem.

09:09.487 --> 09:11.495
Let's go tell your family
they can go.

09:11.722 --> 09:13.930
Hey, guys,
uh, we need to talk.

09:14.018 --> 09:16.422
So, Morgan,
maybe you and Sam

09:16.510 --> 09:18.424
should go to the
movies next weekend.

09:18.829 --> 09:20.469
Sounds fun.

09:20.777 --> 09:23.370
Uh, yeah.
And, uh, next week,

09:23.458 --> 09:24.998
Jen and I can take you
to the beach.

09:25.086 --> 09:26.653
Love it.
Oh, my gosh.

09:26.740 --> 09:29.321
I'm gonna dig holes and then put
towels over them.

09:29.409 --> 09:31.048
Cool. Like to hurt people.

09:31.135 --> 09:32.438
Yeah, you got it.

09:32.642 --> 09:35.212
You guys,
your family is so dope.

09:35.323 --> 09:37.011
Oh, wait. Hang on.

09:37.098 --> 09:38.839
Don't worry, she didn't die.
It's fine.

09:38.926 --> 09:40.580
I know. I know.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.180
Guys, what's going on?
We thought

09:42.268 --> 09:43.365
you were all hiding
in the bathroom because

09:43.452 --> 09:44.584
you couldn't stand Morgan.

09:44.776 --> 09:46.219
We can't stand Morgan.

09:46.307 --> 09:47.761
But we love you.

09:48.057 --> 09:50.594
And, you know, it's much
easier to swallow a turd

09:50.682 --> 09:52.592
if you break it up
into little pieces.

09:52.679 --> 09:53.680
Aw.

09:53.767 --> 09:55.305
That's, like, a
famous quote, right?

09:55.393 --> 09:57.565
Yeah, I think
it's Shakespeare.

10:02.120 --> 10:04.037
<font color=#FFFF00>Story Three:
The Name Game</font>

10:04.125 --> 10:07.735
I can't believe you found
one of these bad boys.

10:07.823 --> 10:09.277
I thought they were
sold out everywhere.

10:09.364 --> 10:12.088
No, I had to go to the store right
before it opened and then outrun

10:12.176 --> 10:13.947
a woman who was eight
and a half months pregnant.

10:14.034 --> 10:16.087
And when I couldn't do that,
I had to pay her 100 bucks.

10:16.174 --> 10:18.118
Well, worth it.
You know what they say...

10:18.206 --> 10:21.289
the more money we spend,
the better parents we are.

10:21.377 --> 10:22.823
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

10:22.940 --> 10:25.237
Baby Alex
is gonna love it.

10:25.646 --> 10:26.908
Alex?

10:27.244 --> 10:28.328
I don't know. I just...

10:28.416 --> 10:29.409
I keep coming back to it

10:29.496 --> 10:30.595
- for some reason. Like,
- Mm.

10:30.682 --> 10:31.790
I think
it's such a cute name.

10:31.877 --> 10:33.854
And, also, it works
for a boy or a girl.

10:34.018 --> 10:36.636
So, do you like it?

10:37.248 --> 10:38.336
I love it.

10:38.424 --> 10:39.116
Let's do it.

10:39.203 --> 10:40.770
Mwah.

10:40.979 --> 10:43.102
And, honey, this time,
we have to keep it

10:43.190 --> 10:44.587
from your family
until I have this baby.

10:44.674 --> 10:45.577
- Mm.
- Yeah, no one has the guts

10:45.665 --> 10:46.657
to criticize a name

10:46.745 --> 10:48.462
once it's attached
to a human.

10:49.172 --> 10:50.084
There are

10:50.171 --> 10:51.985
my pregnant sons.

10:52.274 --> 10:54.741
I have a patient
who's a woodworker.

10:54.828 --> 10:58.626
He's also an arsonist, but
woodworking is his real passion.

10:58.993 --> 11:01.584
What do you think
about rocking chairs

11:01.672 --> 11:04.297
to lull your little angels
to sleep?

11:04.438 --> 11:06.100
- Aw.
- Oh...

11:06.360 --> 11:10.241
Thanks, Mom. But, yeah, we
don't really need one of those.

11:10.329 --> 11:12.561
Yeah, we just got
this hot new bassinet

11:12.649 --> 11:13.760
that everyone's
talking about.

11:13.846 --> 11:16.194
I mean, you probably saw
the article, right?

11:16.282 --> 11:17.766
Parentsmagazine?

11:18.173 --> 11:19.415
No?

11:19.868 --> 11:21.295
I'd love a rocking chair.

11:21.383 --> 11:22.969
We don't have
any nursery furniture yet.

11:23.204 --> 11:26.087
Oh, honey,
I wanted these gifts to match.

11:26.175 --> 11:30.092
I'll ask him to do something,
you know, simple yet elegant.

11:30.180 --> 11:31.491
Like a stool.

11:31.579 --> 11:33.475
Who doesn't love
a simple stool?

11:33.562 --> 11:35.045
Yeah! I mean,
why get a rocking chair

11:35.133 --> 11:36.531
when you can have a stool?
Thanks, Greg.

11:37.784 --> 11:40.084
We have so many stools.

11:40.172 --> 11:42.368
Uh, can it be
anything smaller,

11:42.501 --> 11:44.275
like a... like a baby
rattle or a wooden spoon?

11:44.362 --> 11:45.141
Are you kidding me?

11:45.258 --> 11:46.967
Ooh, a spoon!

11:47.055 --> 11:48.889
Like an heirloom!

11:48.977 --> 11:49.901
And I'll ask him

11:49.989 --> 11:51.474
to engrave it.
Oh!

11:51.646 --> 11:53.456
Well, what are
the babies' names?

11:53.544 --> 11:55.574
- Oh, we were thinking about naming...
- Uh, we-we were both,

11:55.661 --> 11:58.505
uh, thinking that we'd
like to surprise the family

11:58.732 --> 11:59.893
with our names.

12:00.396 --> 12:02.896
Well, I'll tell Gene
to wait on the engraving.

12:02.983 --> 12:04.898
Oh, my gosh.
Yikes.

12:05.113 --> 12:07.831
Please forget I said
my patient's name was Gene.

12:07.919 --> 12:08.815
Oh, it's terrible.

12:08.948 --> 12:10.778
It really is
terrible.

12:11.770 --> 12:13.551
Hey, sorry I had
to jump in there.

12:13.770 --> 12:15.612
You do not want
to let anyone know

12:15.700 --> 12:17.776
the name you've chosen
until the baby is born.

12:17.864 --> 12:20.307
- They'll crap all over it.
- Oh, man. I'm not even worried

12:20.395 --> 12:22.306
about it. You can't ruin
a great name like Alex.

12:22.393 --> 12:25.106
Oh, uh, uh, what, Alex?

12:25.231 --> 12:27.129
Wait, did Jen tell you our name?

12:27.268 --> 12:29.183
No. Alex is the name we picked.

12:29.464 --> 12:32.925
No, Alex is the name
that <i>we</i> picked.

12:33.129 --> 12:34.364
But you can't.

12:34.684 --> 12:36.756
Well, we're gonna
have a baby first.

12:37.153 --> 12:38.536
No, you're not.

12:38.809 --> 12:41.325
Well, we named our baby first.

12:41.412 --> 12:42.518
No, you didn't.

12:42.606 --> 12:45.122
Well, we'll tell
the family first.

12:45.895 --> 12:47.309
No, you won't.

12:48.604 --> 12:49.739
What?

12:49.887 --> 12:51.205
No.

12:52.989 --> 12:53.903
Oh, my God.

12:53.990 --> 12:55.339
We're naming
our baby Alex.

12:57.630 --> 12:58.504
Alex!

12:58.592 --> 12:59.801
You heard!

12:59.996 --> 13:02.057
- What a perfect name!
- Mm.

13:02.145 --> 13:03.870
I'll go tell Mr. Lewis.

13:03.957 --> 13:05.262
Oh, damn it.

13:05.349 --> 13:07.614
Now you know
my patient's last name.

13:12.044 --> 13:13.002
Okay.

13:13.090 --> 13:14.909
You screwed up.
That's obvious.

13:14.997 --> 13:16.066
I don't need to
know the details.

13:16.153 --> 13:17.971
I just need you to
go get the name back.

13:18.058 --> 13:19.317
No problem.

13:20.708 --> 13:21.740
How?

13:21.828 --> 13:23.133
I'm gonna cut to
the chase, Greg.

13:23.221 --> 13:24.660
You've lived
in your brother's shadow

13:24.747 --> 13:25.807
for a long time.

13:25.895 --> 13:26.870
Well, not really.

13:26.958 --> 13:28.024
I'm, like,
five inches taller than him.

13:28.111 --> 13:29.591
And I'm gonna need
you to go out there

13:29.678 --> 13:31.811
and swing that
five inches around.

13:31.898 --> 13:35.489
You know, really show
your brother who's boss.

13:35.739 --> 13:37.067
Greg.

13:40.372 --> 13:42.536
Hey, man. Things got a
little heavy back there,

13:42.624 --> 13:43.729
- but... this is a time
- Mm.

13:43.788 --> 13:45.026
- For celebration.
- Mm.

13:45.114 --> 13:46.753
You know? I mean, we should
be helping each other

13:46.840 --> 13:47.979
on this, uh, uh,

13:48.067 --> 13:50.104
crazy journey called
parenthood, you know?

13:50.192 --> 13:51.221
Couldn't agree more.

13:51.309 --> 13:53.268
You have something
that I want.

13:53.356 --> 13:54.559
- Mm.
- But

13:54.708 --> 13:57.520
I might have
something you want.

13:57.614 --> 13:59.067
I'm listening.

14:02.667 --> 14:04.321
This says "Jarvis."

14:04.458 --> 14:08.221
Now that is our backup
name, real primo. Choice.

14:08.309 --> 14:09.746
God, it kills me to
be giving this up,

14:09.833 --> 14:11.981
but it's yours
if you want it.

14:12.543 --> 14:13.911
Seriously?

14:14.497 --> 14:16.989
Matthew, please.
I'm desperate.

14:22.748 --> 14:24.933
- Got the name back.
- Yes!

14:25.021 --> 14:27.301
Oh. I never once
doubted you out loud.

14:28.521 --> 14:31.998
Hey. So, uh, we'll pick up
the bassinet tomorrow?

14:32.662 --> 14:34.341
You'll pick up
the what now?

14:34.537 --> 14:36.628
There are a million
baby names out there,

14:36.716 --> 14:37.748
but only one of these

14:37.836 --> 14:39.537
- bassinets in town.
- Mm.

14:40.451 --> 14:41.699
You gave 'em our bassinet?

14:41.787 --> 14:42.871
And two stools.

14:42.959 --> 14:44.318
We hear you're
swimming in stools.

14:46.240 --> 14:47.309
You know what?

14:47.397 --> 14:49.638
At least everybody
already loves the name.

14:52.076 --> 14:53.865
We're naming
our baby Alex.

14:54.256 --> 14:57.058
Joanie, I swear I've
lived this moment before.

14:57.146 --> 14:59.746
I thought that was Uncle Matt
and Aunt Colleen's name?

14:59.834 --> 15:01.519
Yeah, but
the important thing is that

15:01.607 --> 15:04.793
the beloved family-sanctioned
name is now ours.

15:04.881 --> 15:06.701
Oh, I don't know.

15:06.802 --> 15:10.654
You know, I liked Alex
by itself, but Alex and Lark?

15:10.826 --> 15:13.003
It sounds like two
little beagle puppies,

15:13.091 --> 15:16.191
and one's fast, and the other
drowns in the river.

15:16.279 --> 15:17.316
- Huh.
- Oh.

15:17.404 --> 15:19.612
I knew an Alex.
He killed a Mark.

15:19.700 --> 15:20.933
It's pretty
close to Lark.

15:21.021 --> 15:23.279
What other names
are you kicking around?

15:23.888 --> 15:25.968
If you guys don't want Alex
anymore, we'll take it.

15:26.055 --> 15:27.903
Alex Short.
I like that.

15:27.991 --> 15:29.318
Oh, hell no.

15:33.959 --> 15:35.687
<font color=#FFFF00>Story Four:
Heather's Business</font>

15:37.755 --> 15:38.939
All right, hustle back!

15:43.316 --> 15:46.728
Hey! Mom, I think we should go
home. I don't feel good.

15:46.816 --> 15:48.843
- Mm. Yeah.
- And I feel like it's something bad.

15:48.931 --> 15:50.486
I'm pretty sure
it's my prostate.

15:50.574 --> 15:53.455
Pro-Probably.
Let me give you one of these.

15:53.543 --> 15:55.127
There you go, sweetie.

15:56.494 --> 15:58.197
Yeah, right?

15:59.439 --> 16:01.875
Um... what did you
just give her?

16:02.002 --> 16:04.267
Oh, this isn't real medication.

16:04.424 --> 16:06.523
When Sophia says
that she's sick

16:06.611 --> 16:08.516
but I think she's probably
just a little anxious,

16:08.603 --> 16:10.445
I give her a candy
from a pill bottle,

16:10.533 --> 16:11.232
then she thinks
she feels better.

16:11.319 --> 16:12.973
Jump ball!

16:15.064 --> 16:16.890
Yeah!
That's genius!

16:16.977 --> 16:18.189
Yeah, it's good.

16:18.545 --> 16:21.759
You could make a fortune selling
those to my family alone.

16:22.697 --> 16:24.734
Yeah. Here you go.

16:24.846 --> 16:28.017
First one's free.
Hmm.

16:29.752 --> 16:32.445
- What's all this?
- Oh! Tim, it's so exciting.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.612
You know how I always give
the kids those fake pills?

16:34.699 --> 16:36.494
Well, word spread around
the basketball moms,

16:36.582 --> 16:37.954
and now I'm selling 'em.

16:38.042 --> 16:38.963
Oh, that's amazing.

16:39.051 --> 16:41.658
I call them, "Feel-Betters."

16:41.783 --> 16:43.181
- Oh, that's good.
- Yeah.

16:43.306 --> 16:45.919
Yeah, makes you think
you'll feel better.

16:46.299 --> 16:48.174
Where'd you get
all the bottles?

16:48.299 --> 16:51.242
Remember when I was asked
to step down

16:51.330 --> 16:52.742
from the school gala committee,

16:52.830 --> 16:54.055
and then I had
that little moment?

16:54.142 --> 16:55.806
Five months was a little moment?

16:55.894 --> 16:57.447
Well, I saved
all my pill bottles.

16:57.541 --> 16:58.845
Well, look at you.

16:58.933 --> 17:01.828
Took real human darkness, turned
it into a fun business idea.

17:01.916 --> 17:02.675
Good for you.

17:02.762 --> 17:04.459
I know. Isn't it amazing?

17:04.546 --> 17:08.517
Oh, Tim, I feel
like this is how Amazon started.

17:09.759 --> 17:11.400
Probably.

17:13.272 --> 17:15.801
Oh, no, it feels so good
to have my own business.

17:15.890 --> 17:17.689
And you know
the best part about this is

17:17.777 --> 17:20.907
that I'm doing everything
all by myself.

17:22.564 --> 17:24.025
All right, guys, how we doing?

17:24.113 --> 17:27.108
Mmm. Um, Tim, honey?
Yeah, not paying you

17:27.196 --> 17:29.431
- to eat the product.
- You're not paying us at all.

17:29.519 --> 17:32.008
Well, why would I?
You are terrible at your job.

17:32.096 --> 17:34.273
I havea job. I'm a doctor.

17:34.361 --> 17:37.523
Yeah? Well, here, you are
just a hot piece of ass.

17:37.611 --> 17:38.775
Aah!

17:39.829 --> 17:42.142
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!

17:42.305 --> 17:44.869
Aunt Heather brought
Soph to play group!

17:45.025 --> 17:46.595
- Hi, guys.
- Oh!

17:46.683 --> 17:50.064
I just came to drop off
these toys of Sophia's.

17:50.169 --> 17:52.981
Oh, wow. Thank you.
That's so sweet.Oh. Yeah.

17:53.075 --> 17:55.888
It's, uh... six Legos

17:55.976 --> 17:57.583
and half a doll
with her hair

17:57.671 --> 17:58.690
- ripped out.
- Mm-hmm.

17:58.778 --> 18:00.675
I mean, Sophia doesn't need
that stuff anymore,

18:00.763 --> 18:03.284
now that she's in
the sixth grade.

18:03.411 --> 18:05.706
Well, I may be
a big girl,

18:05.794 --> 18:08.698
but sometimes I get
little-girl feelings.

18:08.786 --> 18:10.737
I get nervous
and anxious

18:10.825 --> 18:13.050
and sometimes even
a little scared.

18:13.137 --> 18:14.497
Yeah, and as a

18:14.585 --> 18:15.911
caring mom on the go,

18:15.999 --> 18:17.544
I know exactly
what you need.

18:18.231 --> 18:19.354
Feel-Betters.

18:19.442 --> 18:22.058
What is happening?
What are Feel-Betters?

18:22.146 --> 18:24.975
They're my favorite organic,
farm-to-table medicine.

18:25.062 --> 18:26.367
Yeah, here you go, sweetie.

18:26.454 --> 18:27.841
- Thanks, Mom.
- Yeah.

18:27.929 --> 18:29.714
It's just a placebo,

18:29.980 --> 18:31.982
but it's the magical medicine

18:32.046 --> 18:36.311
that takes her tummy
from owie to wowie.

18:36.508 --> 18:39.076
I feel so much better,
and confident.

18:39.241 --> 18:40.795
Like,
if my parents were divorced,

18:40.883 --> 18:42.754
I wouldn't feel any stress
about it.

18:42.842 --> 18:44.350
Can I get some of those?

18:44.994 --> 18:46.083
Bill just left us.

18:46.319 --> 18:48.678
Oh, my God. Claire,
are you okay?

18:48.766 --> 18:51.160
She will be, because I've got
ten bottles of Feel-Betters

18:51.248 --> 18:53.614
right in my purse for $9.99.

18:53.702 --> 18:55.396
Of course you do.

18:55.866 --> 18:57.678
That was a nice performance,
Soph.

19:03.280 --> 19:06.848
Hey, can I talk to you guys
about your, uh, Feel-Betters?

19:06.935 --> 19:08.502
Oh, yeah. Jen, I'm sorry.

19:08.589 --> 19:10.567
I can't shave anything
off the price

19:10.655 --> 19:11.803
just because
you're family.

19:12.178 --> 19:14.723
Uh, listen, as a lawyer,
I should warn you

19:14.811 --> 19:17.043
that selling anything
even remotely close to medicine

19:17.131 --> 19:20.558
just opens you up
to a host of legal landmines.

19:21.053 --> 19:22.270
Good ones?

19:22.358 --> 19:24.590
No. No.

19:24.678 --> 19:26.528
You're encouraging kids

19:26.616 --> 19:29.004
to take a pill
every time they feel bad.

19:29.092 --> 19:31.176
I mean, what happens
when a kid pops a handful

19:31.264 --> 19:33.527
of his mom's Valium thinking
he's eating Feel-Betters?

19:33.614 --> 19:37.004
- Oh, that's a lot of Valium.
- Not if his hands are really small.

19:37.092 --> 19:38.894
Well, that's not the takeaway.

19:38.982 --> 19:40.490
Oh God, no.

19:40.669 --> 19:42.579
- I feel so terrible.
- What?

19:42.898 --> 19:45.828
Oh... No, Tim!
Why didn't you stop me?

19:45.953 --> 19:48.060
This was a terrible idea!
You're a doctor.

19:48.148 --> 19:51.047
'Cause I'm your husband first,
and you were really happy.

19:51.210 --> 19:52.287
All right, fine.

19:52.375 --> 19:54.505
I'll go fire the kids.
Sophia's gonna be pissed.

19:54.593 --> 19:56.445
She's been saving up
her vacation days.

19:56.820 --> 19:58.596
I feel so stupid.

19:58.929 --> 20:01.443
Everything I do is
for somebody else.

20:01.531 --> 20:05.740
You know, it's for my kids
or my husband or my parents,

20:05.828 --> 20:10.281
and I just wanted something
for myself, and... I blew it.

20:10.422 --> 20:11.609
No.

20:12.093 --> 20:14.640
Heather. Hey.

20:14.789 --> 20:18.093
You had an idea that you
turned into an actual business.

20:18.181 --> 20:20.302
- Yeah.
- So, it kills children.

20:20.390 --> 20:21.396
Big deal.
Oh...

20:21.484 --> 20:23.093
Your next idea will be a hit

20:23.226 --> 20:25.630
that might not
kill children, huh?

20:25.718 --> 20:29.375
And when that happens, I'm gonna
be right here to support you.

20:29.836 --> 20:30.836
Thank you.

20:31.375 --> 20:32.630
You know what?

20:32.717 --> 20:34.890
- I do have another idea, actually.
- Oh, yeah?

20:34.978 --> 20:35.771
Okay, you know

20:35.859 --> 20:37.210
- how some kids eat glue?
- Uh-huh.

20:37.297 --> 20:41.191
Well, what if you just put
vitamins right in the glue

20:41.312 --> 20:43.596
and get Vita-Glue?

20:43.804 --> 20:47.406
But, uh, they're still
eating glue, so...

20:48.523 --> 20:50.121
Yeah, I'll just get
my real estate license

20:50.208 --> 20:51.404
like all the other moms do.
