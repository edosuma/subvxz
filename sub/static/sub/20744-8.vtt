WEBVTT

00:53.287 --> 00:55.389
- All right, y'all.

00:55.389 --> 00:56.423
20 acts,

00:56.423 --> 00:59.092
20 incredibly talented acts
right here.

00:59.092 --> 01:00.000
You guys all made it through
the first audition stage.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.329
You guys all made it through
the first audition stage.

01:02.329 --> 01:03.931
But now it gets serious.

01:03.931 --> 01:06.600
20 acts have to be reduced
to seven.

01:06.600 --> 01:10.137
Look to the contestants
on your right and your left.

01:10.137 --> 01:15.275
Two of them,
their dreams will end tonight.

01:15.275 --> 01:16.710
This is when
the word "competition"

01:16.710 --> 01:18.679
starts to mean something.

01:18.679 --> 01:21.615
You got to be better
than the person next to you.

01:21.615 --> 01:23.417
When you get out there
on that stage,

01:23.417 --> 01:25.319
you got to fight.

01:25.319 --> 01:28.221
Don't be that act
that disappears.

01:28.221 --> 01:29.222
Stakes are high.

01:29.222 --> 01:30.000
This is judge cuts.

01:30.000 --> 01:30.223
This is judge cuts.

01:30.223 --> 01:32.192
Let's get to it.

01:32.192 --> 01:35.395
- ♪ You can lift your head
up to the sky ♪

01:35.395 --> 01:37.564
- This is the toughest part
of the process.

01:37.564 --> 01:39.333
The pressure is on.

01:39.333 --> 01:41.134
We have to come up
with seven acts

01:41.134 --> 01:42.803
to go through
to the live shows.

01:42.803 --> 01:46.173
This is it.

01:46.173 --> 01:49.142
- You just never know
what happens on judge cuts.

01:49.142 --> 01:51.345
These days
are full of surprises.

01:51.345 --> 01:53.680
- Who's the toughest judge
on the panel?

01:53.680 --> 01:55.716
- The one that I guess
lacks tact

01:55.716 --> 01:57.317
is Mr. Cowell, of course.

01:59.252 --> 02:00.000
- Who's your favorite judge
to work with?

02:00.000 --> 02:00.854
- Who's your favorite judge
to work with?

02:00.854 --> 02:02.289
- Me.

02:02.289 --> 02:04.257
- Who is gonna be
our celebrity guest judge?

02:04.257 --> 02:05.359
Any idea?

02:05.359 --> 02:06.360
Any idea?

02:06.360 --> 02:07.494
- Could it be Obama?

02:07.494 --> 02:09.062
- What did you say?
- Could it be Obama?

02:09.062 --> 02:11.164
- Is it gonna be Obama?

02:11.164 --> 02:13.400
No!

02:13.400 --> 02:17.371
- ♪ I want the time of my life ♪

02:17.371 --> 02:18.739
- We're praying for
a cute guy.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.574
- What do you mean you're
praying for a cute guy?

02:20.574 --> 02:21.842
- Cute guy.
- Cute guy.

02:21.842 --> 02:24.177
- Really, really cute.
- Really, really cute guy.

02:24.177 --> 02:27.014
- Open your eyes, hello.
- No.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.320
- This is the only show
where you can see singers

02:33.320 --> 02:34.855
and dancers and animal acts

02:34.855 --> 02:36.723
and people swallowing swords.

02:36.723 --> 02:38.959
I'm excited about finding
some real talent.

02:38.959 --> 02:40.961
- This man needs
no introduction,

02:40.961 --> 02:43.096
because he's
a Grammy award-winning,

02:43.096 --> 02:45.198
platinum-selling
recording artist.

02:45.198 --> 02:46.199
My friend.

02:46.199 --> 02:47.701
Y'all make some noise for Ne-Yo.

02:49.903 --> 02:52.272
- Best thing I can tell you
is just leave it on the stage.

02:52.272 --> 02:53.573
You need to walk off that stage

02:53.573 --> 02:56.543
knowing that you did everything
you could possibly do

02:56.543 --> 02:58.412
to the highest level
that you could do it.

02:58.412 --> 03:00.000
- There it is, be great.

03:00.000 --> 03:00.080
- There it is, be great.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.548
Wise words from Ne-Yo.

03:05.886 --> 03:10.123
Give it up for your
"America's Got Talent" judges!

03:13.560 --> 03:16.563
And now, for our
very special guest judge,

03:16.563 --> 03:19.299
my man, Ne-Yo!

03:25.739 --> 03:30.000
Ne-Yo, we are so happy
that you're here with us.

03:30.000 --> 03:30.143
Ne-Yo, we are so happy
that you're here with us.

03:30.143 --> 03:31.812
What are you
looking for tonight?

03:31.812 --> 03:33.814
- Above anything else,
I'm looking for passion.

03:33.814 --> 03:36.083
You know,
you add passion to any art,

03:36.083 --> 03:38.685
and it just becomes that much
bigger and that much better.

03:38.685 --> 03:40.620
- If you absolutely love an act,

03:40.620 --> 03:42.222
you have the power to send them

03:42.222 --> 03:44.024
straight through
to the live shows

03:44.024 --> 03:47.894
with just one push
of that Golden Buzzer.

03:47.894 --> 03:48.895
Go ahead, hit it.

03:48.895 --> 03:49.896
- Go ahead.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.732
- ♪ Ooh ♪

03:51.732 --> 03:55.469

- Yes.
- Yes.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.440
- Yes.
- Yes.

04:00.440 --> 04:01.608
- Let's see some talent.

04:01.608 --> 04:03.009
Let's do this!

04:04.478 --> 04:06.413
- ♪ Let's go now ♪

04:08.882 --> 04:11.685
- Where did you get that?

04:11.685 --> 04:14.387
Oh, you are
our special guest.

04:14.387 --> 04:15.489
We don't get that.

04:15.489 --> 04:17.023
- Usually it's cold;
that's why.

04:17.023 --> 04:18.859
- Usually I say I'm hot,
she'll just blow on me.

04:20.861 --> 04:23.363
- And out of all people
to come in and be a guest judge,

04:23.363 --> 04:25.065
Ne-Yo.

04:25.065 --> 04:26.399
That's huge.

04:26.399 --> 04:27.934
- This is intimidating.
- I know.

04:27.934 --> 04:30.000
- I feel nervous, but before
starting my performance,

04:30.000 --> 04:30.704
- I feel nervous, but before
starting my performance,

04:30.704 --> 04:33.940
I'm always relaxing.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.275
My name is Hara.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.543
I'm from Japan,

04:36.543 --> 04:39.913
and I am an illusionist.

04:39.913 --> 04:43.650
Growing up, I really wanted
to become a magician.

04:43.650 --> 04:46.620
But my village
was very isolated.

04:46.620 --> 04:49.422
There was no magician
and no magic teacher.

04:49.422 --> 04:52.893
So I learned magic by myself.

04:52.893 --> 04:55.829
Nature gave me
so much inspiration

04:55.829 --> 04:58.665
to create something special.

05:02.536 --> 05:06.873
My first audition,
that was best moment in my life.

05:06.873 --> 05:09.109
- A million percent, yes.

05:11.912 --> 05:15.482
- After my audition, I start
creating new performance

05:15.482 --> 05:18.718
using inspiration from fire.

05:18.718 --> 05:21.955
This performance
is very dangerous.

05:21.955 --> 05:24.491
This is my chance
to take my illusion

05:24.491 --> 05:27.961
from small village in Japan

05:27.961 --> 05:29.262
to the world.

05:31.631 --> 05:34.334
- It's a bit spooky.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.236
- He's, like,
your biggest competition, right?

05:36.236 --> 05:37.270
- Yeah.

05:37.270 --> 05:38.572
And, dude, he's legit.

05:59.759 --> 06:00.000
- Oh, my god.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.761
- Oh, my god.

06:10.303 --> 06:11.838
- What's he doing?

06:37.330 --> 06:38.798
- Oh, my god.

06:41.134 --> 06:42.903
How's he gonna get out of it?

06:47.007 --> 06:48.408
- Come on, man.

07:03.056 --> 07:05.792
- Whoa.

07:05.792 --> 07:07.961
- Oh, my god.

07:10.797 --> 07:11.831
- Ah!

07:11.831 --> 07:13.300
- Whoa!

07:23.810 --> 07:24.811
- You're crazy!

07:24.811 --> 07:26.279
- I'm watching.

07:35.255 --> 07:37.724
- That's a tough act
to follow as a magician.

07:37.724 --> 07:41.561
- Now I know why
your name is "Hara!"

07:41.561 --> 07:43.229
- Oh, my god.
- Gosh.

07:43.229 --> 07:44.564
- Thank you so much.

07:44.564 --> 07:46.533
- Mel?

07:46.533 --> 07:48.368
- My heart is still
beating out of my chest.

07:48.368 --> 07:51.304
You scared me so much
that I elbowed the table

07:51.304 --> 07:53.907
and launched myself back.

07:53.907 --> 07:56.376
- Sorry.
- My gosh.

07:56.376 --> 07:57.377
I mean...

07:57.377 --> 07:58.745
- You're telling me.

07:58.745 --> 08:00.000
I peed a little bit.

08:00.000 --> 08:00.080
I peed a little bit.

08:02.615 --> 08:05.685
- I could completely see you
in Vegas right now.

08:05.685 --> 08:07.220
I would pay money
to come see you.

08:07.220 --> 08:10.190
I would sit in the back.

08:10.190 --> 08:11.624
- Why "America's Got Talent"?

08:11.624 --> 08:13.827
Why not do something in Japan?

08:13.827 --> 08:18.031
- Because when I was 17,
I came to Las Vegas,

08:18.031 --> 08:22.168
and I saw America's
best show business.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.170
And they changed my life.

08:24.170 --> 08:28.141
Now I want to bring my show
to America.

08:28.141 --> 08:29.342
That's why I came here.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.000
- Good, good answer.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.611
- Good, good answer.

08:31.611 --> 08:33.947
- Thank you for that.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.315
- You are made for Vegas.

08:35.315 --> 08:37.117
I think you're a great showman.

08:37.117 --> 08:39.619
And twice, you've done
two brilliant auditions now.

08:39.619 --> 08:42.088
So congratulations.

08:42.088 --> 08:43.223
- I loved it.

08:43.223 --> 08:44.924
You know,
we're looking at 20 acts,

08:44.924 --> 08:46.993
and only seven
are going forward.

08:46.993 --> 08:48.128
Let's see what happens.

08:48.128 --> 08:49.429
- Thank you so much.

08:50.997 --> 08:52.599
- It's really gonna be
tough out there.

08:52.599 --> 08:53.967
It really is.

08:58.171 --> 09:00.000
- That was amazing.

09:00.000 --> 09:00.240
- That was amazing.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.374
- And his costumes are great.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.109
You're right,
his showmanship is--

09:03.109 --> 09:04.911
- He's complete.
- Yeah.

09:04.911 --> 09:07.447
- You definitely
shocked the judges.

09:07.447 --> 09:09.082
I don't want to ask
how you did it, but...

09:09.082 --> 09:10.083
- That's what I wanted.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.084
- Man...

09:11.084 --> 09:12.218
- If he could teach my wife

09:12.218 --> 09:14.154
how to do
that quick change thing,

09:14.154 --> 09:17.023
we would never be late
anywhere ever again.

09:19.592 --> 09:20.927
- Whoa!

09:20.927 --> 09:23.663
That is the perfect audition.

09:26.433 --> 09:27.934
- He threw a person
at the judges.

09:27.934 --> 09:29.035
- What more do you want?

09:29.035 --> 09:30.000
- None of it, not more.

09:30.000 --> 09:30.870
- None of it, not more.

09:30.870 --> 09:32.505
- I have no words.

09:43.550 --> 09:45.018
- So you guys are a couple?
- Yes.

09:45.018 --> 09:47.754
- We're married.
- Six years this August.

09:47.754 --> 09:48.788
- We're married too.

09:48.788 --> 09:50.590
- Oh.
- Nice.

09:50.590 --> 09:51.858
- Are you guys a couple?

09:51.858 --> 09:53.126
- No, we are not a couple.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.327
- We're not a couple.

09:54.327 --> 09:58.064
We're actually exes.

09:58.064 --> 10:00.033
- You two are like
an old married couple.

10:00.033 --> 10:01.768
- People watching at home
can't believe

10:01.768 --> 10:03.937
that we're not
romantically linked.

10:03.937 --> 10:07.073
It's just all this sexual
tension and energy.

10:07.073 --> 10:07.911
Yet, we're just professional.

10:07.911 --> 10:08.775
Yet, we're just professional.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.677
- There is something
still going on, right?

10:10.677 --> 10:11.978
- We like to leave it
up in the air.

10:11.978 --> 10:13.813
It's questionable.

10:13.813 --> 10:17.283
- Puh-lease.

10:17.283 --> 10:18.618
Hi, guys.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.286
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:20.286 --> 10:21.921
- Last time,
we were kind of fixated

10:21.921 --> 10:23.656
on the fact
that you were exes

10:23.656 --> 10:25.325
and how you can still
work together.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.527
- Yeah, we're still
gonna be close to each other.

10:27.527 --> 10:29.596
- There's no chance
of getting back together, no?

10:29.596 --> 10:30.663
- No.

10:30.663 --> 10:32.365
- Oh!

10:32.365 --> 10:34.534
- Sorry for asking.

10:34.534 --> 10:35.668
- That was a quick answer.

10:35.668 --> 10:37.911
- Quickest answer
we've ever had.

10:37.911 --> 10:38.471
- Quickest answer
we've ever had.

10:38.471 --> 10:43.209
I don't know
what you did to her, but wow.

10:43.209 --> 10:45.211
- I just want to say
I used to look like that.

10:45.211 --> 10:47.147
I don't now,
but I did at one point.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.548
I just wanted
to put that out there.

10:48.548 --> 10:49.916
Okay, go ahead, guys.

10:49.916 --> 10:52.218

in what you did,

12:25.511 --> 12:28.081
I think it was like watching
a gold medal performance.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.449
I thought it was terrific.

12:29.449 --> 12:30.717
- Thank you.

12:30.717 --> 12:33.886
- This competition is insane.

12:33.886 --> 12:36.022
- So you're sure
there's no possibility

12:36.022 --> 12:37.690
you guys are
getting back together?

12:37.690 --> 12:37.911
I'm saying,
because the chemistry here

12:37.911 --> 12:40.994
I'm saying,
because the chemistry here

12:40.994 --> 12:43.162
is very deceiving.

12:43.162 --> 12:45.732
My wife don't touch me
like that.

12:47.834 --> 12:50.169
- Can I ask
one more question?

12:50.169 --> 12:51.971
Would you have her back?

12:54.974 --> 12:56.542
- No.

12:56.542 --> 12:57.810
- That took too long.

12:57.810 --> 12:59.345
- Ask again.
- Do you want her back?

12:59.345 --> 13:00.480
- Oh, no.

13:01.981 --> 13:03.082
- All right, good luck, guys.

13:03.082 --> 13:06.152
- Thank you.

13:06.152 --> 13:07.911
- If I had to do that
with any of my exes,

13:07.911 --> 13:08.554
- If I had to do that
with any of my exes,

13:08.554 --> 13:10.356
there'd be broken bones
and everything else.

13:10.356 --> 13:11.357
Like, oh, really?

13:11.357 --> 13:12.725
Okay, whoops.

13:14.294 --> 13:17.497
- We're up against some really
amazing talent and singers.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.832
- Yeah, there's
some great singers.

13:19.832 --> 13:20.833
- I'm Nikki.

13:20.833 --> 13:21.801
- I'm Ryan.

13:21.801 --> 13:22.802
- I'm Jaslyn.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.937
- And we are
a family band called...

13:24.937 --> 13:26.806
Edgar.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.609
- When I was 17,
I was touring the world

13:29.609 --> 13:32.312
as a Christian singer.

13:32.312 --> 13:36.082
And then I found out
that I was pregnant with Jas.

13:36.082 --> 13:37.884
I had to then navigate

13:37.884 --> 13:37.911
how life was gonna be
as a teen mom.

13:37.911 --> 13:40.019
how life was gonna be
as a teen mom.

13:40.019 --> 13:42.955
It was a journey
that we took together.

13:42.955 --> 13:45.458
- We watched
each other grow up.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.727
We've just always
been a team.

13:47.727 --> 13:49.262
- We really have.

13:49.262 --> 13:53.666
- ♪ And you can tell everybody
this is your song ♪

13:53.666 --> 13:56.502
- Meeting Nikki was one of
the most natural things ever.

13:56.502 --> 13:58.071
She said, "You know,
I have a daughter."

13:58.071 --> 14:00.206
I was like,
"I know, that's awesome."

14:00.206 --> 14:02.508
- I never really had
a father figure.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.243
But when I first met Ryan,

14:04.243 --> 14:07.847
we connected unlike anything
else in the whole world.

14:07.847 --> 14:07.911
- Ryan and I got married.

14:07.911 --> 14:09.082
- Ryan and I got married.

14:09.082 --> 14:12.719
He immediately wanted
to adopt Jaslyn.

14:12.719 --> 14:14.620
- It's like Jas
was always my daughter.

14:14.620 --> 14:18.291
It was just a matter of time
until I got to her.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.193
I love this girl,
and I love this girl.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.095
I have no reason
to ever wake up

14:22.095 --> 14:24.831
and not be just completely
thankful every day.

14:24.831 --> 14:26.366
- There's no one in the world

14:26.366 --> 14:28.634
who is meant to be here
but you.

14:28.634 --> 14:30.703
Like, I love him.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.071
I love him so much.

14:32.071 --> 14:33.673
- I love you too.

14:33.673 --> 14:37.710
- Having a second chance
to do music like this

14:37.710 --> 14:37.911
and to do it with the people
you love the most,

14:37.911 --> 14:41.080
and to do it with the people
you love the most,

14:41.080 --> 14:43.249
there's not a better
happy ending.

14:46.652 --> 14:49.155
- It's our favorite family.

14:49.155 --> 14:50.423
How are you?

14:50.423 --> 14:51.591
- We're doing great.

14:51.591 --> 14:52.959
- I loved that first audition.

14:52.959 --> 14:54.660
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you so much.

14:54.660 --> 14:56.195
- So, what are you gonna do
for us today?

14:56.195 --> 14:57.797
- This song
that we're gonna sing tonight

14:57.797 --> 14:59.799
is one of the first songs
that we ever sang

14:59.799 --> 15:00.967
together as a family.

15:00.967 --> 15:02.502
So it means a lot to us.

15:02.502 --> 15:03.770

what did you think?

16:56.048 --> 16:57.083
- Well, I love you guys.

16:57.083 --> 16:58.084
You know that.

16:58.084 --> 16:59.085
You sound great.

16:59.085 --> 17:00.253
Your harmonies are great.

17:00.253 --> 17:01.487
But I just have to say,

17:01.487 --> 17:03.623
Nikki, your voice
just blows me away

17:03.623 --> 17:05.391
every single time.

17:05.391 --> 17:07.627
Your voice is like gold to me.

17:10.129 --> 17:12.098
- Howie, better or not?

17:12.098 --> 17:14.300
- Oh, definitely better.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.869
Definitely way better.

17:16.869 --> 17:17.937
I love the package.

17:17.937 --> 17:19.138

17:19.138 --> 17:21.007
I love your look,
I love your sound,

17:21.007 --> 17:22.475
and I love your song choices.

17:22.475 --> 17:25.511
- Thank you.

17:25.511 --> 17:26.746
- Well, first and foremost,

17:26.746 --> 17:31.183
this is one of the most
attractive families ever.

17:31.183 --> 17:32.919
Incredible voices,
all three of you.

17:32.919 --> 17:34.921
The camaraderie,
the chemistry.

17:34.921 --> 17:36.656
Fantastic audition.

17:40.259 --> 17:42.328
- I think
if you do go forward,

17:42.328 --> 17:44.497
you've kind of got to find
what your lane is,

17:44.497 --> 17:45.698
what makes you unique,

17:45.698 --> 17:48.434
because I think, as a group,
you are unique.

17:48.434 --> 17:50.503
I really like you.

17:50.503 --> 17:53.539
And you deserve to be here.

17:53.539 --> 17:54.840
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.643
- We have only got
seven places out of 20.

17:57.643 --> 17:59.011
So I hope it goes well.

17:59.011 --> 18:00.713
But thank you very much,
all of you.

18:00.713 --> 18:01.981

18:05.484 --> 18:07.911

18:09.689 --> 18:12.725

about talent.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.283
Clearly you have tons of it.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.218
- Have you ever been involved
in an amateur show?

18:39.218 --> 18:41.854
- I did
"Showtime at the Apollo."

18:41.854 --> 18:43.189
- Ooh.
- Oh, really?

18:43.189 --> 18:44.991
- I didn't get booed
off the stage completely,

18:44.991 --> 18:47.293
but I got enough to cry
after I got offstage.

18:47.293 --> 18:48.327
- You cried offstage?

18:48.327 --> 18:49.662
- Yes, yes,
because you need that.

18:49.662 --> 18:50.997
See, had I not
experienced that,

18:50.997 --> 18:52.932
I probably wouldn't be
standing in front of you.

18:52.932 --> 18:54.767
Tough love.

18:54.767 --> 18:56.235

18:56.235 --> 18:57.470
We have to kill it out there.

19:05.244 --> 19:07.680
- So, from what you did
from the very first audition,

19:07.680 --> 19:10.583
what's the thought process
to making this better?

19:10.583 --> 19:12.551
- We try to make things
more technical.

19:12.551 --> 19:14.286
We have a surprise
for somebody in it.

19:14.286 --> 19:15.287

19:34.273 --> 19:35.975

very amateurish,

19:35.975 --> 19:38.711
if I'm being honest
with you.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.379

20:51.517 --> 20:53.819
So I decided to do it
all by myself.

20:53.819 --> 20:57.757
- ♪ All by myself ♪

20:57.757 --> 20:59.058
- Currently I'm single.

20:59.058 --> 21:00.192
Awesome.

21:00.192 --> 21:01.911
I spend more time
with the guys

21:01.911 --> 21:01.927
I spend more time
with the guys

21:01.927 --> 21:03.629
than I do with actual humans.

21:03.629 --> 21:06.232
I kind of have a relationship
with my puppets.

21:07.366 --> 21:09.535
- ♪ Ooh, you make me live ♪

21:09.535 --> 21:11.036
- I buy them clothes.

21:11.036 --> 21:12.438
I take them places.

21:12.438 --> 21:13.906
This could be why I'm single.

21:13.906 --> 21:15.241
Okay.

21:15.241 --> 21:16.909
People give us funny looks.

21:16.909 --> 21:21.080
I guess they've never seen
five guys hang out together.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.681
If I ever met somebody special

21:22.681 --> 21:24.016
and they just said to me,

21:24.016 --> 21:25.951
"Look, Chris,
it's me or the puppets,"

21:25.951 --> 21:28.154
I would say,
"It's nice knowing you."

21:28.154 --> 21:29.922
Are we ready to compete?

21:32.358 --> 21:33.793
Hello?

21:33.793 --> 21:36.762
Me and the guys have to pull off
our best performance tonight.

22:54.807 --> 22:56.675

22:59.478 --> 23:00.679
- Guy in the middle.

23:00.679 --> 23:01.911
Give it to the guy
in the middle, all right.

23:01.911 --> 23:03.048
Give it to the guy
in the middle, all right.

23:05.284 --> 23:07.253
- It is very similar
to the first time.

23:07.253 --> 23:08.520
But you know what,

23:08.520 --> 23:13.359
there is still something
kind of baffling about your act.

23:13.359 --> 23:16.161
You kind of
can't stop watching it.

23:16.161 --> 23:20.532
- There is an element
of pure comedy here.

23:20.532 --> 23:24.670
- It's stupid, but I like it.

23:24.670 --> 23:26.238
But overall as an act,

23:26.238 --> 23:28.274
it didn't feel
that you could compete

23:28.274 --> 23:29.842
with some of the acts
we had on tonight,

23:29.842 --> 23:31.143
if I'm being honest with you.

23:32.144 --> 23:33.279
- Out of all of your puppets,

23:33.279 --> 23:35.047
which one
is your favorite, Chris?

23:35.047 --> 23:38.150
- The one behind me.

23:45.858 --> 23:48.661
- I thought that they were
the most in-synch dance group

23:48.661 --> 23:50.362
we've seen all day.

23:52.731 --> 23:54.066
And we loved Simon

23:54.066 --> 23:55.935
being a puppet
in the background, didn't we?

23:55.935 --> 23:58.304
- I really liked Simon
being a puppet.

24:01.407 --> 24:01.911
- Thank you.

24:01.911 --> 24:03.809
- Thank you.

24:03.809 --> 24:05.311
- Thank you.

24:07.446 --> 24:08.781
- It's so silly.

24:08.781 --> 24:11.417
- It is, but he's kind of--
can't stop watching it.

24:11.417 --> 24:13.285
- They didn't know
what to make of it exactly,

24:13.285 --> 24:14.520
but they all enjoyed it.

24:14.520 --> 24:15.688
- Well, that's what counts.

24:15.688 --> 24:17.957
- Is this everything
you thought it would be?

24:17.957 --> 24:19.658
- Everything and more.

24:23.062 --> 24:24.430
- Man.

24:24.430 --> 24:25.764
- Ah!

24:25.764 --> 24:27.533
- He won't stop;
he's like a woodpecker.

24:27.533 --> 24:29.868
- Absolutely incredible.

24:36.842 --> 24:38.610
- I like your sneakers.
- Oh, thank you.

24:38.610 --> 24:41.347
- Those are really cool.
- I like yours.

24:41.347 --> 24:44.350
- I'm Brennley Brown;
I am 14 years old.

24:44.350 --> 24:47.686
- I'm Lori Mae Hernandez;
I'm 13 years old.

24:47.686 --> 24:49.254
- And I sing,
what about you?

24:49.254 --> 24:51.857
- I do comedy.

24:54.460 --> 24:58.630
- When I was 10 years old,
I actually saw Simon.

24:58.630 --> 25:01.133
I ran up to him, and I said,

25:01.133 --> 25:02.701
"Oh, Simon, may I sing for you?"

25:02.701 --> 25:02.938
And he said, "Well, since you
have such nice manners..."

25:02.938 --> 25:05.437
And he said, "Well, since you
have such nice manners..."

25:08.874 --> 25:12.277
I think, after that, I really,
really continued to sing

25:12.277 --> 25:13.846
and practice.

25:13.846 --> 25:15.314
- Brennley is joy.

25:15.314 --> 25:16.515
She's so joy.

25:16.515 --> 25:19.084
Everything about her
is joyful.

25:19.084 --> 25:20.719
- So are you excited
for today?

25:20.719 --> 25:23.856
- Nervously excited.

25:23.856 --> 25:27.893
When I was younger,
I was super shy.

25:27.893 --> 25:30.029
My biggest fear was talking.

25:30.029 --> 25:32.938
And I had extremely
low self-esteem.

25:32.938 --> 25:33.332
And I had extremely
low self-esteem.

25:36.735 --> 25:40.239
I got into comedy
because my dad was sick,

25:40.239 --> 25:42.207
and I wanted to make him smile.

25:43.675 --> 25:45.778
- She helped me recover
in a lot.

25:45.778 --> 25:48.914
Then it really changed
who she is.

25:48.914 --> 25:50.883
- Yeah.

25:50.883 --> 25:52.551
- We're, like, super young,

25:52.551 --> 25:54.720
probably one of the youngest
in the competition.

25:54.720 --> 25:57.856
- I know, right?

25:57.856 --> 26:02.938
- This is the biggest moment
of my life.

26:02.938 --> 26:02.995
- This is the biggest moment
of my life.

26:02.995 --> 26:06.031
I can't let this dream
slip away.

26:07.733 --> 26:10.669
Whoo!

26:10.669 --> 26:12.671
- Hi, Brennley.
- Hey, how you doing?

26:12.671 --> 26:15.174
- They're clapping, and you
haven't done anything yet.

26:15.174 --> 26:16.208
- I know, that's awesome.

26:16.208 --> 26:17.242
Thank you so much.

26:17.242 --> 26:18.477
- That's amazing;
ready to go?

26:18.477 --> 26:19.611
- I'm ready, I'm ready.

26:19.611 --> 26:21.413
- All right, well,
best of luck, Brennley.

27:05.657 --> 27:07.426
- I mean, wowza.

27:07.426 --> 27:12.264
The control that you have
with your voice at 14 years old

27:12.264 --> 27:14.366
is pretty amazing.

27:14.366 --> 27:16.068
It really is.

27:16.068 --> 27:17.069
- Thank you so much.

27:17.069 --> 27:18.637
Thank you very much.

27:18.637 --> 27:21.140
- I have heard that version
of the song

27:21.140 --> 27:22.941
many times in auditions,

27:22.941 --> 27:25.677
so I wasn't mental
about the song choice,

27:25.677 --> 27:29.047
although I do like your voice,
and I think it's different.

27:31.850 --> 27:32.938
Okay, well, thanks a lot.

27:32.938 --> 27:33.352
Okay, well, thanks a lot.

27:33.352 --> 27:35.654
- Thank you.

27:35.654 --> 27:36.822
- How'd it go?

27:36.822 --> 27:38.423
- It went well;
I felt good.

27:38.423 --> 27:42.861
- Felt good?
- Super fun.

27:42.861 --> 27:45.497
- Today is just huge for me,

27:45.497 --> 27:50.869
because I have this one chance
to get to the live shows.

27:52.371 --> 27:54.173
- We meet again, Lori.

27:54.173 --> 27:55.174
How are you?

27:55.174 --> 27:56.208
- Good.

27:56.208 --> 27:57.342
- How old are you, again?

27:57.342 --> 27:58.710
- I'm 13.

27:58.710 --> 28:01.647
- How have your friends reacted
to you being on the show?

28:01.647 --> 28:02.938
- They barely believe it's me.

28:02.938 --> 28:04.650
- They barely believe it's me.

28:04.650 --> 28:06.418
- Because you're quite shy
at school, right?

28:06.418 --> 28:07.419
- I am.

28:07.419 --> 28:09.955
I'm the quiet kid in the corner.

28:09.955 --> 28:11.757
- What have you been doing
to practice?

28:11.757 --> 28:14.026
- I've been practicing
in front of my dogs.

28:16.028 --> 28:17.930
- I was gonna say,
that's got to be good practice.

28:17.930 --> 28:19.164
If you can make a dog laugh,

28:19.164 --> 28:21.867
you probably
got something there.

28:21.867 --> 28:24.136
- Okay, well, Lori,
the stage is yours.

28:24.136 --> 28:25.637
- Thank you.

28:32.811 --> 28:32.938
It's official.

28:32.938 --> 28:34.012
It's official.

28:34.012 --> 28:36.181
I'm a tween.

28:36.181 --> 28:38.083
Yeah, and I know the day
that I crossed over

28:38.083 --> 28:39.518
from kid to tween.

28:39.518 --> 28:42.087
I was standing
in front of a giant bouncy

28:42.087 --> 28:47.693
that made me want to party
like I was 5.

28:47.693 --> 28:50.262
That's when I knew it,
I was a tween.

28:50.262 --> 28:54.733
I'm somewhere between
a sippy cup and a red cup.

28:54.733 --> 28:55.867
Don't get me wrong.

28:55.867 --> 28:58.370
I still love Disney songs.

28:58.370 --> 29:02.140
Now I just want them sung
by hot guys.

29:12.784 --> 29:16.788
And sports have taken
a turn for the worst.

29:16.788 --> 29:21.093
You just don't get a trophy
for showing up anymore.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.862
But my point is,
it's tough being a tween.

29:23.862 --> 29:25.364
That's why I started training.

29:25.364 --> 29:28.867
Apparently, it's so difficult
to become a woman

29:28.867 --> 29:32.938
that you have to train
to wear a bra.

29:32.938 --> 29:34.206
that you have to train
to wear a bra.

29:34.206 --> 29:36.775
And if you don't believe me,
ask Caitlyn Jenner.

29:42.914 --> 29:44.383
- Pretty sharp.

29:44.383 --> 29:45.617
- But no, no, no, no.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.653
I think it's great,
what she's doing.

29:47.653 --> 29:49.988
A dad that would go
to that length

29:49.988 --> 29:52.724
to teach her daughters
how to dress right.

29:54.960 --> 29:57.095
Thank you, thank you, everybody.

30:06.972 --> 30:08.073
- Look at that, Lori.

30:08.073 --> 30:10.542
You got a standing ovation
right there.

30:10.542 --> 30:12.477
- Eeh.
- How about that?

30:12.477 --> 30:14.079
- Lot of talent.

30:14.079 --> 30:15.747
- You are funny, full stop.

30:15.747 --> 30:16.948
You've got this great timing.

30:16.948 --> 30:18.784
You have great confidence
about you.

30:18.784 --> 30:20.686
A lot of people
will relate to you.

30:20.686 --> 30:21.953
- Thank you.

30:24.756 --> 30:27.859
- I cannot even believe that
you're a shy girl at school,

30:27.859 --> 30:30.429
because here you just
own the stage.

30:30.429 --> 30:32.297
- Thank you.

30:32.297 --> 30:32.938
- I'm gonna be
very, very honest.

30:32.938 --> 30:33.899
- I'm gonna be
very, very honest.

30:33.899 --> 30:35.667
I heard "13-year-old comic."

30:35.667 --> 30:38.370
I was completely prepared
to fake-laugh.

30:38.370 --> 30:39.738
"Ha-ha, that was good."

30:39.738 --> 30:42.107
But no,
you're actually really funny.

30:42.107 --> 30:44.209
- Thank you so much.

30:44.209 --> 30:45.944
- A comedian says funny things,

30:45.944 --> 30:48.380
and a comic says things funny.

30:48.380 --> 30:50.482
And you're more of a comic.

30:50.482 --> 30:52.684
You're that 13-year-old girl
with the glasses

30:52.684 --> 30:55.287
who's shy, who's just funny,
and we love her.

30:55.287 --> 30:57.589
And that even means more
and is worth more

30:57.589 --> 31:00.492
than being a great comedian.

31:00.492 --> 31:02.938
- You know, we've only got
seven spots out of 20 acts.

31:02.938 --> 31:03.462
- You know, we've only got
seven spots out of 20 acts.

31:03.462 --> 31:05.697
And I think
there's a great future

31:05.697 --> 31:07.099
for you in this competition,

31:07.099 --> 31:10.635
and I'm gonna fight for you
tonight; I really am.

31:10.635 --> 31:12.404
- Congratulations,
see you later.

31:12.404 --> 31:16.441
- Thank you.

31:16.441 --> 31:18.243
- Aw.

31:21.146 --> 31:22.948
- Oh, my god.

31:22.948 --> 31:25.717
You did so good.

31:25.717 --> 31:27.452
You are so brave.

31:27.452 --> 31:29.654
- ♪ It will never be the same ♪

31:35.660 --> 31:36.728
- What's going on?

31:36.728 --> 31:38.196
- Who's left?

31:38.196 --> 31:40.699
Wait, is there
anything strange left?

31:44.736 --> 31:46.738
- Batten down the hatches,
America,

31:46.738 --> 31:48.707
'cause here comes
the human hammerhead.

31:52.778 --> 31:54.880
- Damn.

31:54.880 --> 31:56.181
- Oh...

32:00.452 --> 32:02.958
- I can't watch this.

32:02.958 --> 32:03.188
- I can't watch this.

32:03.188 --> 32:05.624
- Oh.
- Oh, my gosh, no.

32:05.624 --> 32:08.260
- Do not try
any of this at home.

32:08.260 --> 32:09.995
- Mel, this is for you.

32:12.497 --> 32:15.500
- Oh.

32:15.500 --> 32:17.669
- He's gonna put a nail in
with his head.

32:20.806 --> 32:21.840
Ugh.

32:21.840 --> 32:23.041
- I mean, I can't.

32:23.041 --> 32:24.943
- He won't stop;
he's like a woodpecker.

32:30.482 --> 32:31.983
- I have--I have no words.

32:31.983 --> 32:32.958
Speechless.

32:32.958 --> 32:34.753
Speechless.

32:34.753 --> 32:36.021
- There were no hammer.

32:36.021 --> 32:37.689
You became the hammer.

32:37.689 --> 32:39.124
There was no saws.

32:39.124 --> 32:40.792
You became the saw.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.861
You, sir, are a tool.

32:42.861 --> 32:44.796
- Thank you.

32:48.467 --> 32:50.802
- It's blood
on the side of his head.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.070
- That's crazy.

32:52.070 --> 32:53.738
- What more do you want?

32:53.738 --> 32:55.440
- None of it, not more.

32:55.440 --> 32:57.108
- He put a drill
in his ear...

32:57.108 --> 32:58.109
- I know.

32:58.109 --> 32:59.744
- For you, and for you.

32:59.744 --> 33:02.958
- I hate
to see what's next.

33:02.958 --> 33:04.049
- I hate
to see what's next.

33:04.049 --> 33:05.283
- Yeah!

33:05.283 --> 33:06.618
My name is Jujimufu.

33:06.618 --> 33:08.753
It's gonna get wild out there.

33:10.889 --> 33:12.891
Yeah!

33:16.761 --> 33:18.029
- Oh, my god.

33:18.029 --> 33:19.097
Ow.

33:21.566 --> 33:23.101
- It's getting crazy.

33:25.203 --> 33:27.572
- Oh, my god.

33:32.010 --> 33:32.958
- He's gonna drop her.

33:32.958 --> 33:33.912
- He's gonna drop her.

33:33.912 --> 33:35.680
Oh, my god.

33:37.749 --> 33:38.750
Ah!

33:41.119 --> 33:43.188
- He threw a person
at the judges.

33:44.422 --> 33:46.591
- How are we gonna top that?

33:46.591 --> 33:47.893
- Um...

33:51.663 --> 33:54.833
You're really strong.

33:54.833 --> 33:57.302
- The gorilla,
I'm being honest with you,

33:57.302 --> 33:58.370
wasn't great.

33:58.370 --> 33:59.804
- That's why I got rid of him.

34:02.207 --> 34:02.958
- Thank you.

34:02.958 --> 34:03.208
- Thank you.

34:03.208 --> 34:05.010
- Thank you guys so much.

34:08.179 --> 34:09.748
- A little weird.

34:09.748 --> 34:11.149
A little strange.

34:11.149 --> 34:12.484
- Could be...

34:12.484 --> 34:17.422
the craziest day ever.

34:17.422 --> 34:19.724
- I can't believe you guys are
standing right in front of me,

34:19.724 --> 34:21.893
like, the Duo Guerrero.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.128
- My name is Werner.

34:23.128 --> 34:24.529
- My name is Aura.

34:24.529 --> 34:26.731
We are the Duo Guerrero.

34:26.731 --> 34:27.999
- I've heard your guys' name.

34:27.999 --> 34:30.368
You're one of the greatest
high wire duos out there.

34:30.368 --> 34:32.938
- What we do
is very, very dangerous.

34:32.938 --> 34:32.958
We perform between
30 and 35 feet up in the air.

34:32.958 --> 34:36.641
We perform between
30 and 35 feet up in the air.

34:36.641 --> 34:39.811
And for our audition, we had
a lot of things against us.

34:39.811 --> 34:41.079
We had the wind,

34:41.079 --> 34:44.015
and then we had the sun
right in our face.

34:44.015 --> 34:47.385
Because of the sun, she didn't
see the end of the pedestal.

34:50.488 --> 34:51.957
- She nearly fell.

34:51.957 --> 34:54.626
- Our life is really
on the line.

34:54.626 --> 34:56.728
Every day, every show.

34:56.728 --> 35:00.365
- I'm going to have
to climb up, up there.

35:00.365 --> 35:02.958
As a matter of fact, we know
how dangerous an act it is.

35:02.958 --> 35:03.668
As a matter of fact, we know
how dangerous an act it is.

35:03.668 --> 35:05.770
I have a couple of accidents

35:05.770 --> 35:09.474
where I've fell and broke
my arms, my legs.

35:09.474 --> 35:13.278
And I have a brother
that had a terrible accident.

35:13.278 --> 35:15.847
My brother fell off the wire,
and he's a wheelchair,

35:15.847 --> 35:17.983
paralyzed from the waist down.

35:17.983 --> 35:20.619
It reminds me
to keep on my toes,

35:20.619 --> 35:22.687
because this could be
the last performance.

35:28.093 --> 35:29.928
- Just relax, okay?

35:33.398 --> 35:35.300
Every performance
is like a fight.

35:35.300 --> 35:38.169
We fight with the balance,
fight with the wire.

35:38.169 --> 35:40.105
- Please be safe.

35:40.105 --> 35:42.507
- And then, we are done,
we fight with each other too.

35:48.213 --> 35:49.447
- I like them.

35:49.447 --> 35:51.816
Husband and wife.

35:51.816 --> 35:54.152
- How about this?
- Welcome back.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.420
- Wow.

35:55.420 --> 35:57.522
- So the first time we saw you,
I got to say,

35:57.522 --> 35:59.758
it was the most amazing,
death-defying

35:59.758 --> 36:01.559
thing I have ever seen.

36:01.559 --> 36:02.958
How are you gonna
up your game tonight?

36:02.958 --> 36:03.228
How are you gonna
up your game tonight?

36:03.228 --> 36:04.963
- What we're gonna do
is very unique,

36:04.963 --> 36:06.231
and it's very, very dangerous.

36:06.231 --> 36:08.066
Nobody does it, only us.

36:08.066 --> 36:09.934
- Okay, so you're gonna
do this outside, right?

36:09.934 --> 36:11.403
- Yes.
- Yes.

36:11.403 --> 36:12.837
- Let's all get up,
go outside,

36:12.837 --> 36:14.839
and see the magic happen.

36:14.839 --> 36:16.274
- All righty.

36:21.680 --> 36:24.449
- I wouldn't want to be
doing this tonight.

36:24.449 --> 36:27.218
- I wouldn't want
to be doing this, period.

36:30.622 --> 36:32.257
- Is there a net?
- No.

36:32.257 --> 36:32.958
- There's no net?
- No.

36:32.958 --> 36:34.125
- There's no net?
- No.

36:43.168 --> 36:44.235
- Oh, no.

36:44.235 --> 36:46.504
- Blindfolded,
are you kidding me?

36:52.477 --> 36:56.781
- She has to do all the heavy
lifting in that family.

36:56.781 --> 36:59.617
- Chair, oh, no,
it's not a good idea.

37:12.430 --> 37:14.365
- Oh.
- Oh, no.

37:21.272 --> 37:23.074
- Come on, man.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.909
- Aren't they nuts?

37:30.381 --> 37:32.917
- Stop clapping;
you're gonna make them fall.

37:39.958 --> 37:42.393
- Okay, I'm kind of mad at him,
because he's not doing--

37:42.393 --> 37:44.129
She's doing all the work.

37:48.666 --> 37:50.435
- Oh, no!

37:52.570 --> 37:55.507
- Dude.
- She almost--no.

38:06.050 --> 38:07.685
- My goodness.

38:10.321 --> 38:12.690
Now he's dancing on the wire.

38:15.293 --> 38:16.628
- Oh, no.
- Oh, he's dumb.

38:16.628 --> 38:18.396
- Now he's gonna jump rope.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.601
- Oh, my god.

38:41.753 --> 38:44.389
- That is talent.

38:50.228 --> 38:51.596
- Look.
- Oh, no.

38:51.596 --> 38:56.334
- Oh, no.
- They are completely mad.

38:56.334 --> 38:59.337
- Ugh.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.339
- Oh, no.
- I mean...

39:01.339 --> 39:02.958
- Could really
kill themselves.

39:02.958 --> 39:03.141
- Could really
kill themselves.

39:03.141 --> 39:05.176
This can go so bad so quick.

39:05.176 --> 39:06.511
- Yeah.

39:24.863 --> 39:27.632
- My palms are getting sweaty.

39:50.588 --> 39:54.292
- What you do
is absolutely incredible.

39:54.292 --> 39:57.629
But I have to say,
the first time we saw you,

39:57.629 --> 40:00.064
I felt like the stakes
were higher that time.

40:00.064 --> 40:01.399
- You're out of your mind.

40:01.399 --> 40:02.958
Blindfolded and walked
on a cable on an angle.

40:02.958 --> 40:03.701
Blindfolded and walked
on a cable on an angle.

40:03.701 --> 40:05.003
- I don't know,
I just felt like--

40:05.003 --> 40:06.137
- I'm gonna go to Ne-Yo now.

40:06.137 --> 40:07.672
I don't really like
what Mel's saying.

40:07.672 --> 40:10.875
I don't think Mel knows what
she's talking about. Ne-Yo?

40:10.875 --> 40:13.278
- Why is the role so reversed
with your guys' relationship?

40:13.278 --> 40:15.713
Why was she carrying the chair
and the pole,

40:15.713 --> 40:19.384
and you're standing back
like Vanna White, like...

40:19.384 --> 40:20.818
Why is that?

40:20.818 --> 40:22.687
- Equal rights.

40:22.687 --> 40:23.821
- All right.

40:23.821 --> 40:25.056
- Equal rights.
- Equal rights.

40:25.056 --> 40:26.057
- Can't argue with that.

40:26.057 --> 40:27.525
I applaud you; it was good.

40:27.525 --> 40:28.726
- Truth.

40:28.726 --> 40:29.761
Heidi.

40:29.761 --> 40:31.696
- You are
an incredible couple.

40:31.696 --> 40:32.958
You know, doing this blindfolded
today was pretty spectacular.

40:32.958 --> 40:34.766
You know, doing this blindfolded
today was pretty spectacular.

40:34.766 --> 40:36.234
- Thank you.
- Thank you, thank you.

40:36.234 --> 40:37.635
- Thank you so much
for your time.

40:37.635 --> 40:39.337
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

40:42.674 --> 40:45.610
- I think that this
was scarier than the last time.

40:45.610 --> 40:47.779
- You're alive.
- Yeah, see?

40:47.779 --> 40:48.980
- That's all that matters.

40:48.980 --> 40:50.882
- You have not hit
the Golden Buzzer yet.

40:50.882 --> 40:51.950
- Not yet.

40:51.950 --> 40:54.786
I need somebody
to make me go...

40:54.786 --> 40:56.321
- Jumping out of your seat.

41:02.727 --> 41:04.429
- Ne-Yo, you're doing
an amazing job.

41:04.429 --> 41:05.563
- This is fun.

41:05.563 --> 41:07.799
- You watch football?
- A little bit.

41:07.799 --> 41:08.800
- You know this next guy?

41:08.800 --> 41:10.168
- Yeah, they told me.

41:10.168 --> 41:11.602
That's crazy.

41:11.602 --> 41:13.237
- I have the greatest
gig ever.

41:13.237 --> 41:15.940
Actually, I'm going into my
14th season in the NFL.

41:15.940 --> 41:17.041
- Wait, what?

41:17.041 --> 41:21.479
- Yeah, I play
for the Philadelphia Eagles.

41:21.479 --> 41:23.381
- Hey, Jon, welcome back.

41:23.381 --> 41:24.615
- Thanks, man.

41:24.615 --> 41:26.784
- For those that don't know,
Jon is an Eagle.

41:26.784 --> 41:28.119
He's on the Philadelphia Eagles.

41:28.119 --> 41:29.387
He's the long snapper.

41:29.387 --> 41:29.991
- There we go.

41:29.991 --> 41:31.422
- There we go.

41:31.422 --> 41:33.491
- Then you found your way
into this magic,

41:33.491 --> 41:34.792
even more importantly.

41:34.792 --> 41:36.861
- That's the other magician.

41:36.861 --> 41:38.563
- Really?
- Yeah.

41:38.563 --> 41:39.831
- Who you here with today?

41:39.831 --> 41:42.100
- Beautiful girlfriend Analise,

41:42.100 --> 41:44.168
and my mom, who's my aunt,

41:44.168 --> 41:45.870
who is the greatest mom
in the entire world,

41:45.870 --> 41:48.206
that started raising me
when I was 12, 13 years old.

41:48.206 --> 41:50.308
My sister and I went
into temporary foster care,

41:50.308 --> 41:52.944
and my mom's sister,
who's sitting right there,

41:52.944 --> 41:54.278
gave up her entire life,

41:54.278 --> 41:56.080
did everything she could
to fight for custody

41:56.080 --> 41:57.582
for my sister and I.

42:01.619 --> 42:04.522
When I was 12 years old,
I was at a baseball camp,

42:04.522 --> 42:05.990
and my friend's parents
picked me up

42:05.990 --> 42:07.191
and said there was an accident.

42:07.191 --> 42:09.193
We had to go
to the police station.

42:09.193 --> 42:10.795
I was told that my parents
had an argument

42:10.795 --> 42:13.931
and my dad
was being questioned.

42:13.931 --> 42:17.301
I found out
that she was beaten.

42:17.301 --> 42:20.204
My dad murdered my mom.

42:20.204 --> 42:21.906
He was convicted
of second-degree murder,

42:21.906 --> 42:26.444
and then he was sentenced
to 13 years in prison.

42:26.444 --> 42:29.991
Not only did I lose my mom,
but I lost my dad.

42:29.991 --> 42:30.481
Not only did I lose my mom,
but I lost my dad.

42:30.481 --> 42:32.383
My aunt ended up
taking my sister and I in.

42:32.383 --> 42:35.586
She went from being
a single 32-year-old woman

42:35.586 --> 42:38.589
to all of a sudden
being a mom with two teenagers.

42:38.589 --> 42:41.325
- I always say that
the worst tragedy of my life

42:41.325 --> 42:43.928
became my greatest gift.

42:43.928 --> 42:46.898
There were many nights,
and still are...

42:46.898 --> 42:48.032
- I love you.

42:48.032 --> 42:50.401
- That we cry
and we hold each other

42:50.401 --> 42:54.639
and just know that she's
always looking down on us,

42:54.639 --> 42:59.477
my sister Kathy.

42:59.477 --> 42:59.991
- Magic was my escape.

42:59.991 --> 43:01.813
- Magic was my escape.

43:01.813 --> 43:04.715
Magic was the only thing
that I could do as a kid

43:04.715 --> 43:07.618
that completely
took my mind off everything.

43:07.618 --> 43:11.923
I would totally say
that magic saved my life.

43:11.923 --> 43:13.891
To have my aunt here
at "America's Got Talent"

43:13.891 --> 43:15.393
means the absolute world to me,

43:15.393 --> 43:18.096
and I hope my performance
makes her proud.

43:22.633 --> 43:24.068
- Aw.

43:26.737 --> 43:28.473
- So, I'm gonna
give you the stage.

43:28.473 --> 43:29.707
Best of luck.

43:32.844 --> 43:35.880
- So you said you got to make
the show bigger, so, boom.

43:35.880 --> 43:37.448
Anyways, okay.

43:37.448 --> 43:38.783
So I love this.

43:38.783 --> 43:40.751
Ne-Yo, you're gonna love this.
We got a deck.

43:40.751 --> 43:42.353
They're huge;
you guys can't miss these.

43:42.353 --> 43:44.255
All I want you to do
is just touch any one you want.

43:44.255 --> 43:45.323
It doesn't matter.

43:45.323 --> 43:46.424
- Any one?
- Any one.

43:46.424 --> 43:47.859
- Okay.

43:47.859 --> 43:49.727
- Do you want to keep this
or change your mind?

43:49.727 --> 43:50.895
- I'm gonna change my mind.

43:50.895 --> 43:52.296
- You're that guy,
okay, here.

43:52.296 --> 43:53.965
Just touch one.

43:53.965 --> 43:55.533
- Let's go here.
- Okay, stop.

43:55.533 --> 43:57.635
Do you want to keep this one,
or do you want to change it?

43:57.635 --> 43:59.070
- I'm gonna keep this one.
- You sure?

43:59.070 --> 43:59.991
- Yes.
- I don't want to see it.

43:59.991 --> 44:00.371
- Yes.
- I don't want to see it.

44:00.371 --> 44:01.472
I'm gonna blindfold myself.

44:01.472 --> 44:02.707
Show the camera, show the crowd.

44:02.707 --> 44:03.908
- Don't look.

44:03.908 --> 44:06.043
- I'm not looking;
I'm gonna look down here.

44:06.043 --> 44:07.512
Hey, everybody
think of this card.

44:07.512 --> 44:09.914
Think of the color, the shape,
the size, everything about it.

44:09.914 --> 44:12.416
And here's all I'm gonna do,
is I'm gonna draw this card.

44:12.416 --> 44:15.353
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is ESP at its best.

44:15.353 --> 44:18.489
So far, so good.

44:18.489 --> 44:19.857
All right, here we go.

44:19.857 --> 44:22.827
So when I get this right,
this is so sick.

44:22.827 --> 44:24.862
Ladies and gentlemen,
the card that everybody here

44:24.862 --> 44:25.930
is thinking of.

44:25.930 --> 44:27.398
Ne-Yo, the card
you're thinking of,

44:27.398 --> 44:28.566
you're feeling it right now,

44:28.566 --> 44:29.991
is none other
than the ace of clubs.

44:29.991 --> 44:31.636
is none other
than the ace of clubs.

44:31.636 --> 44:33.804
Killing it.

44:33.804 --> 44:35.173
- Uh-oh.

44:35.173 --> 44:36.474
- That's not the--
- No?

44:36.474 --> 44:37.475
- No, that's not--

44:37.475 --> 44:38.776
- Okay, hold on.

44:38.776 --> 44:40.444
That's amateur hour.

44:40.444 --> 44:42.146
You guys thought
I drew the ace of clubs.

44:42.146 --> 44:43.648
No way.

44:43.648 --> 44:45.716
I thought I'd step this up.

44:45.716 --> 44:48.252
And, ladies and gentlemen,
right here before you,

44:48.252 --> 44:50.755
I drew an entire deck of cards,

44:50.755 --> 44:53.057
and Ne-Yo's card is inside.

44:53.057 --> 44:54.225
See that?

44:54.225 --> 44:55.660
See what I mean?

44:55.660 --> 44:57.461
See what I did there?

44:57.461 --> 44:58.963
- Get it?
- No.

44:58.963 --> 44:59.991
- I tell you what,
this'll be a good trick.

44:59.991 --> 45:00.598
- I tell you what,
this'll be a good trick.

45:00.598 --> 45:02.400
- What was it?
- You want me to tell you?

45:02.400 --> 45:04.268
- It's gonna help me out
a lot right now, yeah.

45:04.268 --> 45:06.704
- Five of clubs.
- Let me see it.

45:06.704 --> 45:09.307
- Okay, good.

45:09.307 --> 45:10.474
What if I could change that?

45:10.474 --> 45:11.475
Watch.

45:11.475 --> 45:12.710
Watch the ace.

45:12.710 --> 45:14.345
Five of clubs,
I got suit right,

45:14.345 --> 45:15.680
so I just got to add
a few clubs.

45:15.680 --> 45:17.248
Watch the ace.

45:17.248 --> 45:18.816
That would have been good,
though, huh,

45:18.816 --> 45:19.817
if I could change it?

45:19.817 --> 45:20.885
- That would have been cool.

45:20.885 --> 45:22.053
That would have been cool.

45:22.053 --> 45:23.654
- Honestly,
I probably would have walked

45:23.654 --> 45:25.523
out of the room and just quit,
because I couldn't top that.

45:25.523 --> 45:27.058
Remember earlier
I said it was inside?

45:27.058 --> 45:28.059
- Yeah.

45:28.059 --> 45:29.991
- Watch.

45:29.991 --> 45:31.395
- Watch.

45:31.395 --> 45:32.396
- No.

45:32.396 --> 45:33.898
- Oh, get the hell out of here.

45:35.733 --> 45:37.101
- There you go, Ne-Yo.

45:37.101 --> 45:39.170
And, now, look, I didn't want
to do this, but look.

45:39.170 --> 45:40.404
Just to show you,

45:40.404 --> 45:42.907
that five has been drawn
on there the entire time.

45:42.907 --> 45:45.142
There is your ace,
there is your five.

45:45.142 --> 45:46.944
I'm Jon Dorenbos, peace out.

45:48.679 --> 45:50.748
- Does that make you
a little bit nervous?

45:50.748 --> 45:53.618
- Yeah.

45:59.023 --> 45:59.991
- Love you guys, thank you.

45:59.991 --> 46:01.759
- Love you guys, thank you.

46:01.759 --> 46:04.495
- Can I see it?

46:04.495 --> 46:05.730
That's amazing.

46:05.730 --> 46:07.064
I'm showing you.

46:07.064 --> 46:08.266
Simon, what do you think?

46:08.266 --> 46:09.767
- I've said this before, Jon.

46:09.767 --> 46:12.003
You know, I actually
do believe in magic.

46:12.003 --> 46:13.237
I don't think there's tricks.

46:13.237 --> 46:15.273
I think people
have magic powers.

46:15.273 --> 46:17.308
You do.

46:17.308 --> 46:19.143
There's no other explanation.

46:19.143 --> 46:20.911
So not only are you
a great football player.

46:20.911 --> 46:22.280
You are a wizard.

46:22.280 --> 46:25.149
- I'll take it, I'll take it.

46:25.149 --> 46:27.051
- That card trick was amazing.

46:27.051 --> 46:28.586
And, you know,
when you sit right here,

46:28.586 --> 46:29.991
it's like, I don't know
how you did that.

46:29.991 --> 46:30.154
it's like, I don't know
how you did that.

46:30.154 --> 46:32.590
But what I love most is you,

46:32.590 --> 46:34.992
the way you perform,
the way you talk,

46:34.992 --> 46:35.993
the way you make us laugh.

46:35.993 --> 46:36.994
- Thank you.

46:36.994 --> 46:38.896
- But the trick itself is great.

46:38.896 --> 46:40.965
- I'm gonna figure this out,
damn it.

46:44.702 --> 46:48.873
- That was good.

46:48.873 --> 46:50.574
- Can I do something?

46:57.982 --> 46:59.784
- Oh!

46:59.784 --> 46:59.991
- Ooh!

46:59.991 --> 47:01.619
- Ooh!

47:01.619 --> 47:09.060
- ♪ When you lose something
you cannot replace ♪

47:09.060 --> 47:11.929

47:11.929 --> 47:14.198

47:16.667 --> 47:20.571
- Jon, Ne-Yo just hit
his Golden Buzzer for you.

47:20.571 --> 47:21.806
How does it feel?

47:21.806 --> 47:23.407
- I'm speechless, man,
I'm speechless.

47:23.407 --> 47:24.475
You're the man, dude.

47:24.475 --> 47:25.476
You're the man.

47:25.476 --> 47:27.011
- Now, Ne-Yo,

47:27.011 --> 47:28.813
tell everyone why you decided

47:28.813 --> 47:29.991
to hit your Golden Buzzer
for Jon.

47:29.991 --> 47:30.381
to hit your Golden Buzzer
for Jon.

47:30.381 --> 47:32.049
- Just looking at it,
somebody might go,

47:32.049 --> 47:33.584
"Okay, it's just card tricks,"

47:33.584 --> 47:34.652
but I see the potential.

47:34.652 --> 47:35.753
I see what it could be.

47:35.753 --> 47:36.854
Should you go all the way,

47:36.854 --> 47:38.189
you might need
a bigger deck, bro.

47:38.189 --> 47:39.824
You might need a bigger deck.

47:39.824 --> 47:41.859
- I've--I've heard that before.

47:44.729 --> 47:46.263
Thank you.

47:46.263 --> 47:49.133
- Jon, you're going straight
through to the live shows

47:49.133 --> 47:53.237
thanks to Ne-Yo
and his Golden Buzzer!

47:53.237 --> 47:57.808
Let's do it.

47:57.808 --> 47:58.876
What a surprise.

47:58.876 --> 47:59.991
- Yeah, that just happened.

47:59.991 --> 48:00.111
- Yeah, that just happened.

48:00.111 --> 48:01.712
- That really just happened.

48:01.712 --> 48:02.880
- That feel good?

48:02.880 --> 48:04.548
- That felt great, actually.

48:04.548 --> 48:06.450
- That right there
was one of the coolest moments

48:06.450 --> 48:07.551
that I'll ever have onstage.

48:08.552 --> 48:09.720
- Let me know he did it.

48:09.720 --> 48:10.855
- There is no hole.

48:10.855 --> 48:12.523
I have no idea
how that got out of there.

48:12.523 --> 48:14.525
- That means now
it's only six spots.

48:14.525 --> 48:15.526
- Only six left.

48:15.526 --> 48:16.827
- From seven to six, right?

48:16.827 --> 48:18.696
- I love you.
- I love you too.

48:18.696 --> 48:21.399
- Oh, all your hard work,
it's paying off.

48:21.399 --> 48:25.002
I'm so proud of you.

48:28.639 --> 48:29.991
- We've lost control.

48:29.991 --> 48:30.007
- We've lost control.

48:30.007 --> 48:33.310
- You are everything
this show is all about.

48:33.310 --> 48:34.745
Whoa!

48:34.745 --> 48:35.980
- I am so happy.

48:43.754 --> 48:45.456
- I saw your audition;
that was pretty tight.

48:45.456 --> 48:46.957
- Nice, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

48:46.957 --> 48:48.125
- You have a beautiful voice.

48:48.125 --> 48:49.260
- Thank you.

48:49.260 --> 48:50.694
- You guys got swag.

48:50.694 --> 48:53.030
I mean, not everybody can
pull off the polka dot shirt.

48:53.030 --> 48:54.899
- Ne-Yo, are you enjoying
working with me?

48:54.899 --> 48:56.033
- So far.

48:56.033 --> 48:57.401
- Are you looking
for compliments?

48:57.401 --> 48:58.803
- Yes, of course he is.

48:58.803 --> 49:00.938
- When you've actually had
something to do with an act,

49:00.938 --> 49:01.972
we'll compliment you.

49:01.972 --> 49:04.308
- Thank you.

49:05.843 --> 49:07.344
- Hey, hey.

49:07.344 --> 49:09.346
- I love these guys.

49:09.346 --> 49:10.918
- Thank you so much.
- Wow.

49:10.918 --> 49:11.282
- Thank you so much.
- Wow.

49:11.282 --> 49:12.683
- The last time we saw you,

49:12.683 --> 49:15.019
you were doing weird things
over Howie.

49:15.019 --> 49:16.220
- Still traumatized.

49:17.521 --> 49:19.590
- Hold still, Howie.
- Oh.

49:19.590 --> 49:22.626
- All right, get ready.

49:22.626 --> 49:23.761
- Oh, yeah!

49:23.761 --> 49:25.229
- He's magnificent,
boys and girls.

49:29.967 --> 49:32.136
- I'm Jon,
I'm 49 years old.

49:32.136 --> 49:34.472
- I'm Owen,
and I'm also 49 years old.

49:34.472 --> 49:36.440
- And we are a comedy
and juggling duo

49:36.440 --> 49:38.008
called The Passing Zone.

49:38.008 --> 49:39.844
- ♪ Love and marriage ♪

49:39.844 --> 49:40.918
- We both met
when we were 20 years old

49:40.918 --> 49:41.545
- We both met
when we were 20 years old

49:41.545 --> 49:44.648
at the same juggling convention
in 1986.

49:44.648 --> 49:46.584
- Our eyes met
from across the room.

49:46.584 --> 49:47.618
- Yeah.

49:47.618 --> 49:49.086
Everything else
got blurry.

49:49.086 --> 49:50.621
- Yeah, it was just--
it was amazing.

49:50.621 --> 49:52.623
- ♪ You can't have one
without the other ♪

49:52.623 --> 49:54.925
- We're still getting along
today, 28 years later.

49:54.925 --> 49:57.261
It's like a marriage,
but without the good parts.

50:01.031 --> 50:03.200
In our first audition,
Simon said...

50:03.200 --> 50:06.136
- Howie has to be connected
with this act going forward.

50:06.136 --> 50:07.438
- Yes.
- Oh, really?

50:07.438 --> 50:10.918
- And we have to find
more dangerous things.

50:10.918 --> 50:12.009
- And we have to find
more dangerous things.

50:12.009 --> 50:13.010
- It was interesting,

50:13.010 --> 50:15.212
because we had planned
on something else.

50:15.212 --> 50:17.314
- Heidi or Mel B, I don't know.

50:17.314 --> 50:20.117
So we decided, all right,
let's figure this out.

50:20.117 --> 50:25.456
It took measuring, welding.

50:25.456 --> 50:27.958
- This is our
most dangerous stunt to date.

50:27.958 --> 50:29.727
- We're a little nervous
about it.

50:29.727 --> 50:31.929
We desperately want to move on
to the next level

50:31.929 --> 50:34.698
and show America
more of what we can do.

50:34.698 --> 50:36.166
This is a little bit
different for us.

50:36.166 --> 50:37.201
- Oh, yeah.

50:37.201 --> 50:39.303
- We are going to perform...

50:39.303 --> 50:40.918
knife throwing.

50:40.918 --> 50:41.038
knife throwing.

50:42.706 --> 50:45.342
- Now, what does every
knife throwing act need?

50:45.342 --> 50:47.678
A lovely assistant.

50:47.678 --> 50:49.547
And that's why we'd like
to ask Mel B

50:49.547 --> 50:51.115
to come join us up onstage.

50:51.115 --> 50:52.283
- Would you please?

50:52.283 --> 50:53.384
- This is gonna be great.

50:53.384 --> 50:54.418
- Let's hear it for her.

50:54.418 --> 50:55.486
- Why don't you do it, Howie?

50:55.486 --> 50:57.054
- I'm just thrilled
it's not me.

50:57.054 --> 50:58.255
Ha!

50:58.255 --> 50:59.557
- Oh, she's so lovely.

50:59.557 --> 51:01.225
Oh, my goodness.

51:01.225 --> 51:02.760
- How are you?
- Pleasure to meet you.

51:02.760 --> 51:04.128
- Thank you so much
for joining us.

51:04.128 --> 51:05.462
Watch your step here.

51:05.462 --> 51:07.965
- Now, we are gonna put you
on this giant pendulum,

51:07.965 --> 51:10.167
and you will swing
back and forth

51:10.167 --> 51:10.918
through the path
of the knives.

51:10.918 --> 51:12.002
through the path
of the knives.

51:12.002 --> 51:13.103
- Right.
- What?

51:13.103 --> 51:14.305
- Ha!

51:14.305 --> 51:16.206
- Listen, there's nothing at all
to worry about.

51:16.206 --> 51:17.808
- Well, there's one thing
to worry about.

51:17.808 --> 51:18.809
- I suppose.

51:18.809 --> 51:20.210
- Owen will be throwing
the knives,

51:20.210 --> 51:24.148
but he's going to be blindfolded
the entire time.

51:24.148 --> 51:25.482
- I love this.

51:25.482 --> 51:27.151
- All right.
- On to the pendulum.

51:27.151 --> 51:28.619
- Come on over here, Mel B.

51:28.619 --> 51:29.887
Watch your step.

51:31.021 --> 51:32.056
- Are you kidding me?

51:32.056 --> 51:34.158
- Hang on a second.
- What is that?

51:34.158 --> 51:35.492
- Oh, my.
- That is not good.

51:35.492 --> 51:37.861
- Okay, that...

51:37.861 --> 51:39.430
- You know what,
it's gonna be okay.

51:39.430 --> 51:40.864
They give you extra parts.

51:40.864 --> 51:40.918
- Yeah, no, it's fine.

51:40.918 --> 51:42.099
- Yeah, no, it's fine.

51:45.002 --> 51:46.704
We are gonna give you
these safety goggles.

51:46.704 --> 51:48.105
- Oh, come on.

51:48.105 --> 51:49.540
- Here you go.
- Okay, very nice.

51:49.540 --> 51:51.642
- Mel, you are so brave.

51:51.642 --> 51:53.110
- All right,
now you're feeling good?

51:53.110 --> 51:55.713
- No, not at all.

51:55.713 --> 51:57.715
- Now, Simon,
the last time we were on,

51:57.715 --> 51:59.650
you made us promise
that if we came back,

51:59.650 --> 52:01.552
we would do
something with Howie.

52:01.552 --> 52:03.087
- Yes, that was the deal.

52:03.087 --> 52:05.122
- Yes, well, we haven't
forgotten about Howie.

52:05.122 --> 52:06.190
- Great.

52:06.190 --> 52:07.558
- Why?

52:07.558 --> 52:10.060
- This stunt has timing,
it has accuracy,

52:10.060 --> 52:10.918
and now, with Howie's help,
it has comedy.

52:10.918 --> 52:13.297
and now, with Howie's help,
it has comedy.

52:13.297 --> 52:15.666
- Oh, yes.

52:17.635 --> 52:18.702
- Simon.

52:18.702 --> 52:20.070
- Come on up here, Howie.

52:20.070 --> 52:23.807
Yes, here he comes.

52:23.807 --> 52:26.477
- Do it for America.

52:26.477 --> 52:29.213
- Am I gonna get wet?
- Well, there's a good chance.

52:29.213 --> 52:30.648
- This is gonna get good.

52:30.648 --> 52:32.883
- Seat yourself
right out on the edge

52:32.883 --> 52:34.051
of this platform right here.

52:34.051 --> 52:35.552
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

52:35.552 --> 52:36.987
- Why are you laughing?

52:39.890 --> 52:40.918
Why are you laughing?

52:40.918 --> 52:41.225
Why are you laughing?

52:46.397 --> 52:48.465
- Okay.

52:48.465 --> 52:50.100
- I am so happy.

52:50.100 --> 52:51.502
- I'm so angry.

52:53.037 --> 52:54.104
- Let's do it.

53:00.744 --> 53:02.780
- Are you kidding me?

53:07.785 --> 53:08.786
- Now!

53:08.786 --> 53:09.887
- Ah!

53:09.887 --> 53:10.918
- Whoa.

53:10.918 --> 53:13.257
- Whoa.

53:13.257 --> 53:14.692
- Now!

53:14.692 --> 53:18.028
- No!

53:18.028 --> 53:19.163
- Now!

53:19.163 --> 53:20.564
- Whoa!
- Oh, my god!

53:20.564 --> 53:21.565
Fall in!

53:21.565 --> 53:23.901
- This is so scary.

53:23.901 --> 53:26.370
- Ah!

53:26.370 --> 53:27.905
- Now!

53:27.905 --> 53:30.908
- Ah!

53:32.810 --> 53:35.345
- Down goes Howie!

53:38.315 --> 53:40.918
- Oh, my god.

53:40.918 --> 53:41.118
- Oh, my god.

53:47.858 --> 53:49.193
- Everybody's on their feet.

53:49.193 --> 53:53.430
That was an amazing act.

53:53.430 --> 53:54.798
- Oh, my gosh, I feel bad,

53:54.798 --> 53:59.069
but it's kind of funny
a little bit.

53:59.069 --> 54:01.038
- It's not fun.

54:01.038 --> 54:03.841
- Howie.
- I feel so bad.

54:03.841 --> 54:04.975
- Our hero.

54:04.975 --> 54:06.977
- Howie made a big splash.
- Yes, he did.

54:06.977 --> 54:10.918
- The fact that you're doing
bad things to Howie,

54:10.918 --> 54:12.082
- The fact that you're doing
bad things to Howie,

54:12.082 --> 54:13.417
I love you.

54:13.417 --> 54:14.852
- Well...

54:14.852 --> 54:16.620
- Very creative, very inventive.

54:16.620 --> 54:19.323
Like, 17 different tricks
all rolled into one.

54:19.323 --> 54:20.591
And you guys are funny.

54:20.591 --> 54:21.925
- Thank you.
- That's very kind.

54:21.925 --> 54:22.993
- Thanks, Ne-Yo.

54:22.993 --> 54:24.228
- I'd like
to suggest something

54:24.228 --> 54:25.529
if you go forward.

54:25.529 --> 54:29.032
The act has now
to include Howie permanently...

54:29.032 --> 54:30.000
- No.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.168
Obviously Mel,

54:31.168 --> 54:32.569
and I'd like it
to use Heidi as well.

54:32.569 --> 54:34.004
Thanks a lot,
good night, everyone.

54:34.004 --> 54:35.005
- Thank you, everybody.

54:38.542 --> 54:40.577
- That made me so happy.

54:40.577 --> 54:40.918
And you're both
gonna be in it again.

54:40.918 --> 54:42.246
And you're both
gonna be in it again.

54:42.246 --> 54:43.514
- No, we're not.
- No, no.

54:43.514 --> 54:44.948
- Yes, and you.

54:44.948 --> 54:46.850
- No more.
- I am so happy.

54:46.850 --> 54:47.885
- I won't even take a bath.

54:47.885 --> 54:48.952
Why did I do that?

54:48.952 --> 54:50.354
I don't take a bath;
I take showers.

54:50.354 --> 54:51.955
I will not sit in a bathtub.

54:51.955 --> 54:53.323
Oh!

55:05.536 --> 55:08.005
- We started singing together
in a group years ago.

55:08.005 --> 55:09.540
- Not only do they have
a lot of singers.

55:09.540 --> 55:11.275
They have a lot
of great singers.

55:11.275 --> 55:12.876
- I would love
to be the new face

55:12.876 --> 55:14.745
for Americana
and bluegrass music.

55:14.745 --> 55:16.280

55:34.998 --> 55:37.901

you look great.

55:37.901 --> 55:40.137
There's no one like you guys.

55:43.607 --> 55:45.342
- Plus, there's such
a gap in our age.

55:45.342 --> 55:46.577
I'm like, oh, my god.

55:46.577 --> 55:48.846

56:15.772 --> 56:17.274

56:17.274 --> 56:19.243
I used to be Diana Ross'
opening act.

56:19.243 --> 56:20.410
And every night I'd come out

56:20.410 --> 56:21.879
and listen to her
sing that song,

56:21.879 --> 56:23.881
and you guys did it justice.

56:23.881 --> 56:25.449
I think you hit it
out of the park.

56:25.449 --> 56:28.352
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

56:28.352 --> 56:30.621
- Wow, once again,
that bar is moving on up.

56:30.621 --> 56:31.965
That bar is being
raised and raised.

56:31.965 --> 56:33.790
That bar is being
raised and raised.

56:33.790 --> 56:37.394
My name is Ronee Martin,
and I'm 62 years old.

56:37.394 --> 56:41.498
The journey to this point,
it has been very, very long.

56:41.498 --> 56:42.699
Coming out of high school,

56:42.699 --> 56:45.736
everybody got married
and had kids.

56:45.736 --> 56:47.471
- ♪ Some people live

56:47.471 --> 56:50.574

that I wasn't gonna do that.

56:50.574 --> 56:52.643
I had dreams
of becoming a singer.

56:56.713 --> 56:58.348
Breaking into
the music industry,

56:58.348 --> 57:00.484
it is extremely hard.

57:00.484 --> 57:01.965
I've been trying my entire life
to get into this,

57:01.965 --> 57:04.121
I've been trying my entire life
to get into this,

57:04.121 --> 57:07.124
and I just have not been able
to catch that break.

57:07.124 --> 57:08.659
So I had to get a job.

I've been an assistant
at an entertainment law firm.

57:16.166 --> 57:17.567
It's a little mundane.

57:17.567 --> 57:20.237
It's certainly not
where I want to be.

57:20.237 --> 57:22.472

57:41.825 --> 57:46.630
I cannot let this dream
slip away.

57:46.630 --> 57:49.099
So I've got to put
my heart and soul into it.

57:52.636 --> 57:54.304

1:00:18.148 --> 1:00:19.916
Lord, have mercy.

1:00:19.916 --> 1:00:21.618
I know that,
you know, people talk

about age and all of that stuff

1:00:23.386 --> 1:00:25.122
in regard to the business

1:00:25.122 --> 1:00:28.358
But I personally feel
like talent and the right song

1:00:28.358 --> 1:00:29.726
supersedes all of that.

1:00:29.726 --> 1:00:31.161

1:00:31.161 --> 1:00:31.965

about you is on point.

1:00:35.532 --> 1:00:38.235
The way that you look,
your personality,

1:00:38.235 --> 1:00:41.571
the way that you sing
with such ease.

1:00:41.571 --> 1:00:46.743
I just want to hear you
more and more and more.

1:00:46.743 --> 1:00:48.945
- I shut my eyes
for a moment, Ronee,

1:00:48.945 --> 1:00:50.480
and it was like I was listening

1:00:50.480 --> 1:00:53.216
to Dionne Warwick
or Gladys Knight.

1:00:53.216 --> 1:00:57.687
It really felt that you had
a massive, massive career,

1:00:57.687 --> 1:00:59.923
say, 20 years ago,

1:00:59.923 --> 1:01:01.965
and you were coming back tonight
to sing one of your hits again.

1:01:01.965 --> 1:01:04.327
and you were coming back tonight
to sing one of your hits again.

1:01:04.327 --> 1:01:08.365
It's like the world missed you
for some reason, Ronee.

1:01:08.365 --> 1:01:11.368
- ♪ Ain't no mountain
high enough ♪

1:01:11.368 --> 1:01:12.802
- If you stay on this show

1:01:12.802 --> 1:01:15.005
and just continue to sing
as good as you're singing,

1:01:15.005 --> 1:01:16.907
the world's gonna catch up
with you, Ronee.

1:01:16.907 --> 1:01:18.275
I have a feeling.

1:01:18.275 --> 1:01:22.045
- ♪ Ain't no mountain
high enough ♪

1:01:22.045 --> 1:01:23.413
- That was a great performance.

1:01:23.413 --> 1:01:25.215
- Thank you.
- Amazing.

1:01:28.018 --> 1:01:31.965
- How do you feel?
- I feel fantastic.

1:01:31.965 --> 1:01:32.455
- How do you feel?
- I feel fantastic.

1:01:32.455 --> 1:01:34.391
- It just felt so dang good.

1:01:34.391 --> 1:01:36.193
It just felt so good
and so right,

1:01:36.193 --> 1:01:38.595
and so--it's just time.

1:01:38.595 --> 1:01:40.163
- You enjoy it?
- I did.

1:01:40.163 --> 1:01:41.565
- We have to get it
down to six.

1:01:41.565 --> 1:01:43.333
- This is gonna be tough.

1:01:49.139 --> 1:01:51.141
- Everything that I have
ever done in this business,

1:01:51.141 --> 1:01:53.009
I have done with integrity.

1:01:53.009 --> 1:01:58.248
I never used my feminine charms
to get ahead.

1:01:58.248 --> 1:02:00.517
Now that I've reached
a point in my career

1:02:00.517 --> 1:02:04.821
where I would be willing to...

1:02:04.821 --> 1:02:06.790
no one's interested.

1:02:09.326 --> 1:02:13.496
I am not saying that you should
play the tramp card,

1:02:13.496 --> 1:02:15.365
because I know I have tried

1:02:15.365 --> 1:02:15.969
to play the tramp card
at this stage in life,

1:02:15.969 --> 1:02:18.335
to play the tramp card
at this stage in life,

1:02:18.335 --> 1:02:22.339
only to have the guy say,
"Uh, no, this is expired."

1:02:28.278 --> 1:02:30.680
- I like people
who can make fun of themselves,

1:02:30.680 --> 1:02:32.048
and that's what you did.

1:02:32.048 --> 1:02:34.818
You are confident.

1:02:34.818 --> 1:02:39.589
What you said relates
to a lot of people.

1:02:39.589 --> 1:02:41.491
I'm not looking at you.

1:02:43.360 --> 1:02:45.195
- What exactly--

1:02:46.863 --> 1:02:48.932
Mother-.

1:02:48.932 --> 1:02:50.834
What are you trying to say?

1:02:50.834 --> 1:02:52.936
You're gonna get water
thrown on you.

1:02:52.936 --> 1:02:55.171
You know what?

1:03:00.210 --> 1:03:02.512
- Oh, oh, no,
this is getting bad.

1:03:02.512 --> 1:03:04.814
- We've lost control.

1:03:04.814 --> 1:03:06.983
- Oh, my god,
she's, like, all wet.

1:03:06.983 --> 1:03:10.587
- Yes.
- Yes.

1:03:10.587 --> 1:03:12.956
- I didn't say a word.

1:03:12.956 --> 1:03:14.524
What is your problem?

1:03:14.524 --> 1:03:15.969
- This cup is full.

1:03:15.969 --> 1:03:16.960
- This cup is full.

1:03:16.960 --> 1:03:18.395
- You were very funny.

1:03:18.395 --> 1:03:19.663
- Congratulations.

1:03:19.663 --> 1:03:20.897
I'm not saying another word.

1:03:24.834 --> 1:03:26.736
- That stage
is a little hot.

1:03:26.736 --> 1:03:29.506
- I'm getting nervous, man.

1:03:29.506 --> 1:03:31.274
- Are you nervous?

1:03:31.274 --> 1:03:33.243
- Yeah, I'm pretty nervous.

1:03:33.243 --> 1:03:35.478
My name's Axel Perez,
I am 17 years old.

1:03:35.478 --> 1:03:38.181
I am a high school student
in Las Vegas.

1:03:38.181 --> 1:03:39.716
My life is pretty normal.

1:03:39.716 --> 1:03:41.584
You know,
I go to school every day,

1:03:41.584 --> 1:03:43.019
fall asleep probably
first period.

1:03:44.120 --> 1:03:45.488
I hang out with my friends.

1:03:45.488 --> 1:03:45.969
At the mall, we look for girls.

1:03:45.969 --> 1:03:47.223
At the mall, we look for girls.

1:03:47.223 --> 1:03:48.992
But at the same time,
my life is pretty crazy.

1:03:50.327 --> 1:03:53.096
My first audition
was off the chart.

1:03:53.096 --> 1:03:54.798
I can take this act to levels

1:03:54.798 --> 1:03:56.566
that you guys
have never seen before.

1:03:56.566 --> 1:03:57.901
- Which is what?

1:03:57.901 --> 1:04:00.003
- You're just gonna
have to pass me to find out.

1:04:02.472 --> 1:04:03.907
There's a lot
of added pressure.

1:04:03.907 --> 1:04:06.142
In this next round,
I'm definitely upping my game.

1:04:06.142 --> 1:04:08.678
I'm tripling the height
of the whole act.

1:04:08.678 --> 1:04:12.482
If I fall,
I could end up in the hospital.

1:04:12.482 --> 1:04:14.818
It feels amazing
to have my mom supporting me,

1:04:14.818 --> 1:04:15.969
right next to me,
you know, onstage.

1:04:15.969 --> 1:04:17.053
right next to me,
you know, onstage.

1:04:17.053 --> 1:04:18.521
We've been practicing.

1:04:38.241 --> 1:04:39.542
I'm willing to take this risk

1:04:39.542 --> 1:04:44.914
because I have to get
to those live shows.

1:04:44.914 --> 1:04:45.969
- His first act was amazing.

1:04:45.969 --> 1:04:49.552
- His first act was amazing.

1:04:49.552 --> 1:04:51.020
- Hi, Axel, how are you?

1:04:51.020 --> 1:04:52.055
- A little nervous.

1:04:52.055 --> 1:04:53.623
- Really?
- Yeah.

1:04:53.623 --> 1:04:56.059
- Because it's more dangerous
than what you've done last time?

1:04:56.059 --> 1:04:57.227
- Yeah, I'm doing some tricks

1:04:57.227 --> 1:04:58.728
that, if I fall,
I can't catch myself.

1:04:58.728 --> 1:05:00.463
- You look nervous.
- I know.

1:05:00.463 --> 1:05:02.766
- But now you're
making me nervous.

1:05:02.766 --> 1:05:04.801
- Good luck to you.
- Thank you.

1:05:04.801 --> 1:05:06.669
- He looks
absolutely petrified.

1:05:06.669 --> 1:05:08.738
- I know, I was trying
to make it light.

1:05:08.738 --> 1:05:10.607
- You're making it worse.

1:05:13.176 --> 1:05:14.411
- This is crazy.

1:05:16.212 --> 1:05:17.881
- It's the same
roller ball thing,

1:05:17.881 --> 1:05:20.417
but that high, oh, gosh.

1:05:24.187 --> 1:05:25.622
Ugh.

1:05:45.909 --> 1:05:45.969
- What now?

1:05:45.969 --> 1:05:46.910
- What now?

1:05:46.910 --> 1:05:48.645
He's so tied up.

1:06:00.457 --> 1:06:05.061
- Oh, lordy, lordy, lordy.

1:06:05.061 --> 1:06:06.229
- He takes a topple on that,

1:06:06.229 --> 1:06:09.833
he's gonna get in trouble.

1:06:09.833 --> 1:06:10.867
- That's crazy.

1:06:10.867 --> 1:06:12.602
Are you kidding me?

1:06:12.602 --> 1:06:15.969
- How are you even
getting up on this?

1:06:15.969 --> 1:06:16.773
- How are you even
getting up on this?

1:06:16.773 --> 1:06:18.808
- Is that happening?

1:06:18.808 --> 1:06:21.277
- Not remotely safe.

1:06:21.277 --> 1:06:23.346
Not remotely safe.

1:06:33.556 --> 1:06:34.691
It's turning.

1:06:34.691 --> 1:06:36.526
Is it meant to turn?

1:06:49.239 --> 1:06:51.774
- I don't know that I could
let my kid do that.

1:06:51.774 --> 1:06:53.243
- Wow.

1:06:53.243 --> 1:06:54.244
- Whoa.

1:06:54.244 --> 1:06:55.812
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:07:06.122 --> 1:07:07.957
- Whoa.

1:07:07.957 --> 1:07:09.025
- He's good.

1:07:09.025 --> 1:07:10.260
That guy is good.

1:07:16.499 --> 1:07:18.101
- Boy oh boy oh boy.

1:07:18.101 --> 1:07:19.469
Simon, what did you think?

1:07:19.469 --> 1:07:22.038
- You've nearly
given me a heart attack,

1:07:22.038 --> 1:07:24.173
I mean, genuinely.

1:07:24.173 --> 1:07:26.342
You are crazy.

1:07:26.342 --> 1:07:27.577
- Yes, I am.

1:07:27.577 --> 1:07:28.978
- You really, really are.

1:07:28.978 --> 1:07:31.014
And if you get through,
what's next?

1:07:31.014 --> 1:07:34.350
- Next time, I promise you that
I'm gonna do something again

1:07:34.350 --> 1:07:36.219
that you've never seen
on this show.

1:07:36.219 --> 1:07:38.221
- And you're 17 years old.

1:07:38.221 --> 1:07:39.789
- 17, single.

1:07:41.357 --> 1:07:43.860
- I could really feel
the danger.

1:07:43.860 --> 1:07:45.495
You kicked it up a notch,

1:07:45.495 --> 1:07:45.969
and that is, like,
the perfect audition.

1:07:45.969 --> 1:07:48.298
and that is, like,
the perfect audition.

1:07:48.298 --> 1:07:49.699
- Thank you.

1:07:49.699 --> 1:07:50.967
- This is a tough night.

1:07:50.967 --> 1:07:54.137
We have to send
13 acts home.

1:07:54.137 --> 1:07:55.738
- Wow.
- But I think you're wonderful.

1:07:55.738 --> 1:07:56.940
I think you're great.

1:07:56.940 --> 1:07:58.541
- And single.

1:07:58.541 --> 1:07:59.609
- And single.
- And single.

1:07:59.609 --> 1:08:00.710
Let's not leave that out.

1:08:00.710 --> 1:08:02.545
You almost killed yourself
to entertain us,

1:08:02.545 --> 1:08:04.547
so I applaud you.

1:08:04.547 --> 1:08:05.648
- Thank you so much.

1:08:05.648 --> 1:08:06.916
Thank you.

1:08:06.916 --> 1:08:08.251
- That was pretty unbelievable.

1:08:08.251 --> 1:08:09.586
Thumbs up, good job.

1:08:09.586 --> 1:08:10.687
- Thank you.

1:08:10.687 --> 1:08:14.724
- And I'm happy
nothing happened.

1:08:14.724 --> 1:08:15.969
- I think he's gone
a bit nuts.

1:08:15.969 --> 1:08:16.659
- I think he's gone
a bit nuts.

1:08:16.659 --> 1:08:18.261
- Are we being responsible

1:08:18.261 --> 1:08:20.597
saying, "Okay, try it,
go higher"?

1:08:20.597 --> 1:08:23.099
- Mom, you seemed very poised,
as the judges said.

1:08:23.099 --> 1:08:24.233
Were you concerned at all?

1:08:24.233 --> 1:08:25.768
- Oh, no, no, I trust him.

1:08:25.768 --> 1:08:27.170
- You knew he had it.
- Yeah.

1:08:49.459 --> 1:08:51.194
- Wow.

1:08:58.935 --> 1:09:00.269
- You are special.

1:09:00.269 --> 1:09:02.805
I mean, you could not have done
any more.

1:09:02.805 --> 1:09:04.540
- I feel, you know,
it's my passion,

1:09:04.540 --> 1:09:04.911
and if you see
that I love what I'm doing,

1:09:04.911 --> 1:09:07.343
and if you see
that I love what I'm doing,

1:09:07.343 --> 1:09:10.279
and it just exerts out
that everyone's gonna enjoy it.

1:09:10.279 --> 1:09:12.548
- Yeah, and we did.
- You could see that.

1:09:12.548 --> 1:09:14.684
- Well done.
- Thank you.

1:09:18.421 --> 1:09:20.757
- Tell me something, you said
you were looking for passion

1:09:20.757 --> 1:09:21.924
at the beginning of the night.

1:09:21.924 --> 1:09:23.026
Feeling the passion?

1:09:23.026 --> 1:09:24.327
You still feeling the passion?

1:09:24.327 --> 1:09:26.863
- Yeah, yeah.

1:09:26.863 --> 1:09:28.197
- Everything
inside of us, dude,

1:09:28.197 --> 1:09:29.565
we're gonna put it
on that stage.

1:09:29.565 --> 1:09:30.566
- That's right, bro.

1:09:30.566 --> 1:09:32.235
- Y'all with me, or what?

1:09:32.235 --> 1:09:34.911
- Hell yeah.
- Let's get it crackin'.

1:09:34.911 --> 1:09:35.838
- Hell yeah.
- Let's get it crackin'.

1:09:35.838 --> 1:09:36.973
- I'm Ekoe.

1:09:36.973 --> 1:09:38.708
- Big Rome.
- Montre.

1:09:38.708 --> 1:09:39.776
- I'm China.

1:09:39.776 --> 1:09:42.278
And we're Linkin' Bridge.

1:09:42.278 --> 1:09:45.214
- We've known each other
all our lives.

1:09:45.214 --> 1:09:47.016
- Everybody has
that same passion.

1:09:47.016 --> 1:09:49.552
Everybody has that same
love for music.

1:09:49.552 --> 1:09:52.689
- We all have a rough story.

1:09:52.689 --> 1:09:53.956
I mean, we all grew up

1:09:53.956 --> 1:09:56.659
in the worst project complex
in the Midwest.

1:09:56.659 --> 1:09:59.228
- We were in a neighborhood
where there was gangs.

1:09:59.228 --> 1:10:00.563
- Running from the police,

1:10:00.563 --> 1:10:02.331
or, you know,
you're hearing gunshots,

1:10:02.331 --> 1:10:04.911
and growing up in a community
where crack just--

1:10:04.911 --> 1:10:04.967
and growing up in a community
where crack just--

1:10:04.967 --> 1:10:06.469
like they just dropped it
out of a plane

1:10:06.469 --> 1:10:07.904
and it landed
in your neighborhood,

1:10:07.904 --> 1:10:09.505
and just watching
all your friends

1:10:09.505 --> 1:10:12.075
either get locked up,
killed, or...

1:10:14.377 --> 1:10:20.383
When I was 6, my mother,
she went to prison.

1:10:20.383 --> 1:10:22.952
And we were sent through homes,
foster homes.

1:10:22.952 --> 1:10:26.456
And I just remember being
in a stranger's home

1:10:26.456 --> 1:10:28.658
and being alienated
in a room,

1:10:28.658 --> 1:10:32.528
and all I had was the radio.

1:10:32.528 --> 1:10:34.911
I don't know,
the music has been our refuge.

1:10:34.911 --> 1:10:35.732
I don't know,
the music has been our refuge.

1:10:35.732 --> 1:10:38.301
I used that to escape,

1:10:38.301 --> 1:10:41.637
so I didn't fall victim
to what's on that corner.

1:10:43.706 --> 1:10:48.010
Our first audition
was absolutely amazing.

1:10:48.010 --> 1:10:53.149
- It was sensational.

1:10:53.149 --> 1:10:56.018

This is amazing.

1:13:43.920 --> 1:13:45.788
- Thank you very much, indeed.

1:13:51.360 --> 1:13:53.496
- Howie, what do you think?

1:13:53.496 --> 1:13:55.898
- Ne-Yo said
at the beginning of the night,

1:13:55.898 --> 1:13:58.901
he wants to see passion.

1:13:58.901 --> 1:14:00.603
And that passion that I see,

1:14:00.603 --> 1:14:03.406
that emotion, that humanity,
that humility,

1:14:03.406 --> 1:14:04.911
you hit on every level,
and I just love it.

1:14:04.911 --> 1:14:08.210
you hit on every level,
and I just love it.

1:14:08.210 --> 1:14:10.212
- Thank you.

1:14:10.212 --> 1:14:12.581
- Thank you.

1:14:12.581 --> 1:14:13.849
- Ne-Yo.

1:14:13.849 --> 1:14:15.217
- Howie hit it
right on the head.

1:14:15.217 --> 1:14:16.452
I said when I first
got out here

1:14:16.452 --> 1:14:17.820
that I'm looking for passion.

1:14:17.820 --> 1:14:21.090
If you can make me feel
what you're singing about,

1:14:21.090 --> 1:14:23.960
it's raw emotion,
it's raw passion

1:14:23.960 --> 1:14:26.462
that I see from y'all.

1:14:26.462 --> 1:14:28.831
That's gonna take y'all
all the way.

1:14:28.831 --> 1:14:30.700
It's gonna take y'all far.

1:14:30.700 --> 1:14:32.201
- Thank you.

1:14:32.201 --> 1:14:34.911
- I'm impressed.

1:14:34.911 --> 1:14:36.005
- I'm impressed.

1:14:36.005 --> 1:14:37.340
- I loved you the last time.

1:14:37.340 --> 1:14:38.708
I love you again today.

1:14:38.708 --> 1:14:40.609
I just never want it to end.

1:14:40.609 --> 1:14:42.678
It's incredible.

1:14:42.678 --> 1:14:44.113
- Well, wow.

1:14:44.113 --> 1:14:45.848
Love you guys.

1:14:45.848 --> 1:14:47.516
You four are flawless.

1:14:47.516 --> 1:14:49.318
You all hold your own.

1:14:49.318 --> 1:14:51.187
You all support each other.

1:14:51.187 --> 1:14:53.622
Just brilliant,
absolutely brilliant.

1:14:53.622 --> 1:14:55.157
- Thank you.

1:14:59.895 --> 1:15:02.098
- You know,
when I was talking

1:15:02.098 --> 1:15:03.499
about maybe coming on this show,

1:15:03.499 --> 1:15:04.911
and I was trying to think
of what, in my mind,

1:15:04.911 --> 1:15:05.835
and I was trying to think
of what, in my mind,

1:15:05.835 --> 1:15:08.704
we were looking for.

1:15:08.704 --> 1:15:10.906
And then I just realized
what it was.

1:15:10.906 --> 1:15:13.509
It's you.

1:15:15.745 --> 1:15:17.446
- Thank you.

1:15:22.018 --> 1:15:25.621
- Big words from Simon Cowell.

1:15:30.893 --> 1:15:34.597
- There are times that we've
wanted to give up,

1:15:34.597 --> 1:15:34.911
you know, individually
wanted to give up.

1:15:34.911 --> 1:15:37.566
you know, individually
wanted to give up.

1:15:37.566 --> 1:15:39.935
And, you know, and I believed

1:15:39.935 --> 1:15:42.738
that we could come
to this show and do something,

1:15:42.738 --> 1:15:45.307
and if we can change the world
through our music,

1:15:45.307 --> 1:15:46.675
then here we are.

1:15:48.244 --> 1:15:53.082
- ♪ Hallelujah ♪

1:15:53.082 --> 1:15:56.052
- You've really been clever
on your song choices.

1:15:56.052 --> 1:15:58.621
I always say to people,
why don't you take a risk?

1:15:58.621 --> 1:15:59.855
Why don't you have a moment?

1:15:59.855 --> 1:16:01.557
And twice you've done that.

1:16:01.557 --> 1:16:03.659
And the fact that I can see
that you're friends.

1:16:03.659 --> 1:16:04.911

1:16:32.421 --> 1:16:34.590

1:16:34.590 --> 1:16:34.911

supposed to do this,

1:16:34.911 --> 1:16:36.892
- Being told we're not
supposed to do this,

1:16:36.892 --> 1:16:39.361
leave it alone,
give up on your dream.

1:16:39.361 --> 1:16:41.931
It's...

1:16:41.931 --> 1:16:44.967
It's been a long time coming.

1:16:44.967 --> 1:16:48.871
- This is it.

1:16:48.871 --> 1:16:51.607

Welcome back to "America's Got
the judge cuts.

1:17:04.220 --> 1:17:05.888
All 20 acts have performed.

1:17:05.888 --> 1:17:07.089
Now it's crunch time.

1:17:07.089 --> 1:17:08.858
The judges are gonna
head upstairs,

1:17:08.858 --> 1:17:10.459
make some decisions.

1:17:10.459 --> 1:17:12.294
Emotions are running high.

1:17:12.294 --> 1:17:14.029
- You've put
your Golden Buzzer through.

1:17:14.029 --> 1:17:17.933
Six more acts
out of the 20.

1:17:17.933 --> 1:17:20.336
- Well, I try not to be nervous,

1:17:20.336 --> 1:17:24.673
but I am nervous
as nervous could be.

1:17:24.673 --> 1:17:27.576
- This is a yes.
- No, it's not.

1:17:27.576 --> 1:17:28.844
- What about this guy?

1:17:28.844 --> 1:17:28.881
I think we're crazy
throwing this guy away.

1:17:28.881 --> 1:17:31.981
I think we're crazy
throwing this guy away.

1:17:31.981 --> 1:17:33.449
- This is it.

1:17:33.449 --> 1:17:37.786
It really is my last chance to
have the dream of my lifetime.

1:17:37.786 --> 1:17:39.855
- This is a definite yes.
- I agree.

1:17:39.855 --> 1:17:41.924
- I mean, that's what
this round's all about.

1:17:41.924 --> 1:17:43.392
And these guys.

1:17:43.392 --> 1:17:46.362
- It feels like everything
that we've done in our life

1:17:46.362 --> 1:17:48.664
has come down to this moment.

1:17:48.664 --> 1:17:50.366
We was made for this.

1:17:50.366 --> 1:17:55.371
And we don't want to go back
to where we came from.

1:17:55.371 --> 1:17:58.641
- For me, boom,
and there's your seven, right?

1:17:58.641 --> 1:17:58.881
- I'm with you.

1:17:58.881 --> 1:18:02.211
- I'm with you.

1:18:02.211 --> 1:18:04.947
- Okay, everybody, the judges
have made their decisions.

1:18:04.947 --> 1:18:07.316
Will the following acts
please come with me to stage?

1:18:07.316 --> 1:18:08.918
- You've been great, buddy.
- Thank you.

1:18:08.918 --> 1:18:10.352
- Great to work with.
- Thank you.

1:18:10.352 --> 1:18:13.289
You know what, I walked into
this not knowing what to expect.

1:18:13.289 --> 1:18:15.291
I had an absolute ball.

1:18:15.291 --> 1:18:18.327
- Brennley Brown, Ronee,

1:18:18.327 --> 1:18:20.462
and Julian and the Hay-Burners.

1:18:32.508 --> 1:18:33.976
- All three acts should feel

1:18:33.976 --> 1:18:36.679
very, very good
about their performance.

1:18:36.679 --> 1:18:43.285
Unfortunately, only one act
will go through.

1:18:43.285 --> 1:18:49.758
The act going forward
to the live show is...

1:18:49.758 --> 1:18:52.361
Ronee.

1:18:52.361 --> 1:18:54.997
Congratulations.

1:18:54.997 --> 1:18:57.099
We're very excited
to see you in the live shows.

1:18:57.099 --> 1:18:58.300
- Congratulations, Ronee.

1:18:58.300 --> 1:18:58.881
And, by the way,
real commiseration,

1:18:58.881 --> 1:18:59.768
And, by the way,
real commiseration,

1:18:59.768 --> 1:19:03.872
because I hate to losing both
of that, genuinely.

1:19:03.872 --> 1:19:06.075
- Thank you so much
for the opportunity.

1:19:06.075 --> 1:19:07.076
Thank you.

1:19:07.076 --> 1:19:10.379
- No, thank you for coming.

1:19:10.379 --> 1:19:13.682
- I am so happy for you.

1:19:13.682 --> 1:19:18.120
- This has been one of the most
incredible moments ever.

1:19:18.120 --> 1:19:21.390
I'm just absolutely speechless,
and that's hard for me.

1:19:21.390 --> 1:19:23.692
- I think all three acts
deserved to go through.

1:19:23.692 --> 1:19:25.861
- They really did, if you
looked at them all separately.

1:19:25.861 --> 1:19:28.097
- But Brennley especially.

1:19:28.097 --> 1:19:28.881
I mean, we just had
too many good people.

1:19:28.881 --> 1:19:30.733
I mean, we just had
too many good people.

1:19:30.733 --> 1:19:33.369
- Hey, hey,
we're very proud of you.

1:19:33.369 --> 1:19:36.138
- I'm sad, but it's okay.

1:19:36.138 --> 1:19:39.074
There was nothing else
I could have done.

1:19:39.074 --> 1:19:41.577
It's just not my time
right now.

1:19:41.577 --> 1:19:43.078
And I'm gonna go home.

1:19:43.078 --> 1:19:46.882
I'm still gonna work
as hard as I did before.

1:19:52.254 --> 1:19:55.324
- So we spent a long time
talking about all of you three,

1:19:55.324 --> 1:19:57.393
as to who
we're gonna put through.

1:19:57.393 --> 1:19:58.881
Unfortunately, we're gonna lose
two of you at this stage,

1:19:58.881 --> 1:20:00.229
Unfortunately, we're gonna lose
two of you at this stage,

1:20:00.229 --> 1:20:04.133
and only one's going
through to the live show.

1:20:04.133 --> 1:20:07.636
So the act that
will be making it

1:20:07.636 --> 1:20:13.976
through to the live shows is...

1:20:13.976 --> 1:20:14.977
Jon and Owen.

1:20:14.977 --> 1:20:18.480
Congratulations.

1:20:18.480 --> 1:20:20.749

1:20:26.155 --> 1:20:28.190

- Nice job.
- Oh, my god.

1:20:42.171 --> 1:20:45.374
- I know today is very stressful
and heavy,

1:20:45.374 --> 1:20:47.276
but just know that
both of you guys

1:20:47.276 --> 1:20:49.144
thoroughly entertained us,

1:20:49.144 --> 1:20:52.915
so you should be really pleased
in actually getting this far.

1:20:52.915 --> 1:20:58.020
But this is a competition,
and now is decision time.

1:20:58.020 --> 1:20:58.881
The act moving on is...

1:20:58.881 --> 1:21:05.861
The act moving on is...

1:21:05.861 --> 1:21:07.162
Lori.

1:21:07.162 --> 1:21:09.164

1:21:09.164 --> 1:21:10.399
Oh, my gosh.

1:21:10.399 --> 1:21:11.900
- Well done, Christopher,
I'm sorry.

1:21:11.900 --> 1:21:13.235

1:21:13.235 --> 1:21:16.505

1:21:21.076 --> 1:21:22.878

1:21:22.878 --> 1:21:25.581

how he does it.

1:21:31.153 --> 1:21:33.322
I made it.

1:21:33.322 --> 1:21:36.125
I'm going to the live shows!

1:21:39.928 --> 1:21:42.698

- Wow, this is really tough.

1:21:59.415 --> 1:22:01.250
There's just
so much talent this year,

1:22:01.250 --> 1:22:04.219
and this ripped my heart out.

1:22:04.219 --> 1:22:08.657
The tough choice we mad is...

1:22:08.657 --> 1:22:11.493
none of you are moving on.

1:22:11.493 --> 1:22:13.228

1:22:42.157 --> 1:22:45.093
- You know why I feel bad
about this decision?

1:22:45.093 --> 1:22:47.162
because two of these acts

1:22:47.162 --> 1:22:49.364
risked their lives
for our entertainment.

1:22:49.364 --> 1:22:50.866
I think we made
the right decision,

1:22:50.866 --> 1:22:52.034
but we made
a tough decision.

1:22:52.034 --> 1:22:54.236
- 100%, they gave everything.

1:23:01.710 --> 1:23:03.579
- This has been
really, really hard.

1:23:03.579 --> 1:23:05.881
I'm not gonna lie to you.

1:23:05.881 --> 1:23:08.183
And we've made
the same decision

1:23:08.183 --> 1:23:09.885
about both acts.

1:23:13.522 --> 1:23:18.193
And it's not good news.

1:23:24.066 --> 1:23:26.335
It's great news.

1:23:26.335 --> 1:23:27.336
You're through.

1:23:35.777 --> 1:23:37.246
- We did it, man.

1:23:37.246 --> 1:23:39.047
- You did it.

1:23:48.991 --> 1:23:51.960

really happy for you.

1:23:51.960 --> 1:23:53.028
Keep it up.

1:23:53.028 --> 1:23:54.029

1:23:54.029 --> 1:23:57.866

- Sacrifice, man.
- Sacrifice, man.

1:24:10.946 --> 1:24:15.183
- When you got to put
everything on hold.

1:24:15.183 --> 1:24:17.586

1:24:17.586 --> 1:24:20.489

everything that I can

1:24:20.489 --> 1:24:26.228
to take us to the top,
whatever I got to do.
