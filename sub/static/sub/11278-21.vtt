        Cheers <i>is filmed</i>        
 <i>before a live studio audience.</i> 

00:08.000 --> 00:10.400
    Okay, Rebecca, uh,          
        here's the deal.        

00:10.500 --> 00:11.900
  I'll paint the whole office,  

00:11.900 --> 00:15.700
      including woodwork,       
and, uh, it'll run you...       

00:15.800 --> 00:17.000
                         400.   

00:18.800 --> 00:20.000
400 bucks sounds reasonable.    

00:20.100 --> 00:21.400
    Oh, no, that's 400 beers.   

00:21.500 --> 00:24.800
         The "B" with the slanty
             line through it....

00:24.900 --> 00:26.500
             It's kind of my own
             special currency.  

00:28.700 --> 00:30.100
    It's a deal.                

00:30.100 --> 00:31.800
Oh, and, Norm, remember--       

00:31.900 --> 00:33.500
this time Sam wants             
something really simple.        

00:33.600 --> 00:36.200
              Oh, yeah. I've got
        some, some choices here.

00:36.300 --> 00:39.100
        Um, I've got sand white,

00:39.200 --> 00:40.400
             uh, ivory white,   

00:40.500 --> 00:41.700
                off-white,      

00:41.800 --> 00:42.500
                 Navajo white...

00:42.700 --> 00:43.900
They all look just alike.       

00:44.000 --> 00:46.200
        Well, they're different.
Are you sure?                   

00:46.200 --> 00:47.400
              Well, yeah. Of    
              course I'm sure.  

00:47.500 --> 00:48.500
          What do you think?    

00:48.600 --> 00:50.300
        I'm trying to push      
        one color on you?       

00:50.300 --> 00:51.600
I mean, I resent that, Rebecca. 

00:51.600 --> 00:52.700
    Oh, I'm sorry.              

00:52.800 --> 00:54.200
No, that one's                  
 fine, right there.             

00:54.300 --> 00:55.500
                Oh, cream white.
    Mm-hmm.                     

00:55.600 --> 00:56.900
            Excellent choice.   

00:56.900 --> 00:57.900
  And, as luck would have it,   

00:57.900 --> 01:00.500
  I happen to have 42 gallons   
      of it in my garage.       

01:03.800 --> 01:05.700

02:17.600 --> 02:18.600
Well, good morning, Sam.        

02:18.700 --> 02:20.500
  Yeah? What's good about it?   

02:20.600 --> 02:24.000
  Well, you have your health,   
  a good business, and friends  

02:24.100 --> 02:26.100
      who put up with your      
      violent mood swings.      

02:27.800 --> 02:28.800
        Yeah. I'm sorry.        

02:28.900 --> 02:30.300
          It's just...          
      I got some bad news.      

02:30.400 --> 02:33.600
You guys all remember the       
Miss Boston Barmaid contest?    

02:33.700 --> 02:35.000
      Oh, yeah.                 

02:35.100 --> 02:36.000
    That's the annual contest   

02:36.000 --> 02:37.600
            where they try to   
          find the most talented

02:37.700 --> 02:39.200
                and efficient   
             waitress in Boston,

02:39.300 --> 02:40.800
            which-- surprise,   
                surprise--      

02:40.800 --> 02:43.800
 always turns out to be the babe
     with the biggest honeydews.

02:45.500 --> 02:48.300
     Right. Well, this year     
 they're holding it at Cheers.  

02:48.300 --> 02:49.700
         All right!             
  All right!                    

02:49.800 --> 02:51.100
      No, no, no, no. No,       
    It's not what you think.    

02:51.200 --> 02:53.100
                They changed all
            the categories here.

02:53.100 --> 02:55.900
    Listen to this-- speed,     
efficiency, memorization,       

02:55.900 --> 02:58.400
personal warmth, courtesy.      

02:58.500 --> 03:01.400
I mean, it's like bra size      
  doesn't even exist anymore!   

03:03.800 --> 03:05.500
    Well, Sam, they're just     
      trying to keep pace       

03:05.500 --> 03:07.100
        with the current        
     social enlightenment.      

03:07.200 --> 03:09.400
I mean, how would <i>you</i> like      
      to be judged solely       

03:09.500 --> 03:11.900
on the basis of your looks      
      and your body alone?      

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
     I'd love it. I'd win.      

03:14.700 --> 03:15.700
            The whole contest   

03:15.800 --> 03:17.000
    has gone to hell.           

03:17.100 --> 03:19.700
    I mean, believe me, I-I,    
I really presented my case      

03:19.700 --> 03:21.000
to the contest committee.       

03:21.000 --> 03:22.200
See, I made a graph here.       

03:22.300 --> 03:24.800
Look at this. Now, these        
the bust measurements           

03:24.900 --> 03:26.600
of all the winners              

03:26.700 --> 03:28.400
since 1976,                     
and almost                      

03:28.400 --> 03:30.700
 to a woman, they're over a 38. 

03:30.700 --> 03:32.800
            What's this one that
             dips way down here?

03:32.900 --> 03:35.200
Uh, that's the year Diane won.  

03:38.700 --> 03:40.800
         It's no good.          
It's just no good at all.       

03:40.900 --> 03:42.900
    I think I'm gonna           
      write my councilman.      

03:42.900 --> 03:44.500
 Oh, what am I talking about?!  

03:44.600 --> 03:46.500
  My councilman's a babe, too!  

03:46.600 --> 03:49.600
     God, the whole world's     
    crowding in on me!          

03:49.600 --> 03:51.700
        Carla, you gonna try out
        for this contest?       

03:51.800 --> 03:53.500
I don't think so.               
            Well, you heard Sam.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.700
                  It's not about
                looks this year.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.900
Thank you, Woody.               
                      You should

04:03.000 --> 04:03.700
do it, Carla.                   

04:03.700 --> 04:04.500
                Look, I know    

04:04.600 --> 04:05.600
        I'm a good waitress.    

04:05.700 --> 04:07.100
            I don't need        
        some obnoxious dork     

04:07.200 --> 04:09.000
            in a cheap suit     
        telling me I'm the best.

04:09.100 --> 04:10.000
But you <i>are</i> the best.           

04:10.100 --> 04:11.800
                I just said I   
            didn't need that.   

04:14.400 --> 04:16.800
  Besides, even if I did win,   
    what would I get?           

04:16.800 --> 04:18.899
A lousy ten bucks               
and a handshake?                
                        Well,   

04:19.000 --> 04:21.100
      it says here you get      
    a brand new Mazda Miata.    

04:21.200 --> 04:24.200
    Get out of town.            

04:24.200 --> 04:25.800
Just for doing my job?          

04:25.900 --> 04:27.500
                         Mm-hmm.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.900
        Oh...                   

04:29.900 --> 04:31.400
I'm gonna get myself this Miata.

04:31.500 --> 04:32.500
                      All right.

04:32.600 --> 04:33.500
Yeah.                           

04:33.600 --> 04:35.700
                Uh! Uh-oh. Snag.

04:35.800 --> 04:38.400
             What about warmth, 
             personal courtesy? 

04:40.900 --> 04:43.600
What about me shoving this      
  brochure up your nose?        

04:45.100 --> 04:46.300
            You're a shoo-in.   

04:53.000 --> 04:55.400
I couldn't help but notice,     
for the last couple of days     

04:55.500 --> 04:57.500
you have just been sitting      
here doing nothing.             

04:59.800 --> 05:00.900
         Hi. I'm Norm Peterson. 

05:01.000 --> 05:02.200
      Obviously, we haven't met.

05:02.300 --> 05:03.500
This really bothers me.         

05:03.600 --> 05:04.600
                        Why?    

05:04.700 --> 05:06.200
 Because, because you           
have a job to do                

05:06.300 --> 05:07.700
     and instead, you           
  are just sitting here         

05:07.700 --> 05:09.000
talking to Cliff all day long.  

05:09.100 --> 05:10.800
I mean, you're                  
not even trying.                

05:10.900 --> 05:12.700
     Rebecca, do you <i>get</i> Cheers?

05:12.700 --> 05:14.700
              I mean, do you    
         understand the concept?

05:18.500 --> 05:20.700
    I want to see some work     
      by the end of today.      

05:20.800 --> 05:23.400
If you can't get the job done,  
I will hire a professional.     

05:23.400 --> 05:25.700
Oddly enough, that's what       
  Vera said on our honeymoon.   

05:30.200 --> 05:33.000
So, uh, how're you              
gonna get out of this one?      

05:33.100 --> 05:34.400
                  Relax, Cliffy,

05:34.400 --> 05:35.300
    I got it covered.           

05:35.400 --> 05:36.800
          I have a new          
industrial paint sprayer.       

05:36.800 --> 05:38.600
    Gets the job done           
     in a couple of hours.      

05:38.700 --> 05:39.700
Very clever.                    

05:39.800 --> 05:40.600
                      Mm-hmm.   

05:40.800 --> 05:42.200
                 It was invented
                 by the Japanese

05:42.200 --> 05:44.700
 so they could paint, you know, 
 more efficiently and quickly.  

05:44.700 --> 05:46.500
    Whereas you will use it     
      to drink more beers,      

05:46.600 --> 05:47.900
         watch more TV,         
     and put off everything     

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
  until the very last minute.   

05:49.100 --> 05:50.800
        Right. You see,         
    they're way ahead of us     

05:50.900 --> 05:53.800
 in technology, but they don't  
      have our creativity.      

05:56.600 --> 05:59.100
Hey, Doc, how do you think      
    I look for the contest?     

05:59.100 --> 06:02.500
Well, my goodness, Carla,       
that is a jaunty bow!           

06:02.600 --> 06:04.600
                    Yeah.       

06:04.700 --> 06:06.100
        Where did you get it?   

06:06.100 --> 06:07.300
        Well...                 

06:07.400 --> 06:09.300
the first job                   
I ever had was, uh,             

06:09.400 --> 06:11.400
at this greasy spoon            
when I was 15.                  

06:11.500 --> 06:15.600
There was this old waitress     
     there, named Cora.         

06:15.700 --> 06:17.700
  She taught me everything      
I know about waiting tables.    

06:18.500 --> 06:20.800
Anyway, on, uh, her last day,   

06:20.900 --> 06:23.900
the day they were carting her   
off to the nursing home,        

06:23.900 --> 06:26.100
she gave me this bow.           

06:26.100 --> 06:27.700
      She told me               
 to wear it with pride          

06:27.700 --> 06:31.600
because being a waitress        
is a wonderful thing.           

06:31.600 --> 06:34.100
    Carla, that's quite a story.

06:34.100 --> 06:36.200
 Now, if the judges             
 are as sappy as you,           

06:36.200 --> 06:37.400
I get me a new car!             

06:37.500 --> 06:38.800
     (laughing)                 

06:40.700 --> 06:41.700
    Carla.                      

06:41.800 --> 06:42.700
     (clears throat)            

06:42.800 --> 06:44.200
 Honey, I just want you to know 

06:44.300 --> 06:48.000
that I've got some... moral     
problems with this contest.     

06:49.300 --> 06:51.600
 It's not gonna get in the way  
     of me hoping you win.      

06:51.700 --> 06:52.700
                    Yeah. Well, 
                    thanks, Sam.
          Yeah.                 

06:52.700 --> 06:54.300
          Now, would you give me
          my button over there? 

06:54.400 --> 06:56.300
            Oh.                 

06:56.400 --> 06:58.500
Here. "My name's Carla          
and I love your smile."         

06:58.600 --> 07:00.000
(chuckles):                     
      Here.                     

07:00.000 --> 07:02.200
Boy, you're really prepared     
to go all the way for this.     

07:02.300 --> 07:04.200
            Yeah. I got a button
            that says that, too.

07:04.300 --> 07:05.600
         Think I should wear it?

07:05.600 --> 07:07.600
    No, no. I'd stick           
  with the smile thing.         

07:07.700 --> 07:08.900
                    Right.      

07:09.000 --> 07:10.100
Could I have some service?      

07:10.100 --> 07:11.200
                         Coming!

07:13.700 --> 07:16.400
                Hi. I'll be     
            your waitress today.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.000
            How may I serve you?

07:18.100 --> 07:19.500
    I want a martini.           

07:19.500 --> 07:21.600
         Dry. D-R-Y.            

07:21.700 --> 07:23.400
And that means                  

07:23.400 --> 07:24.700
     light on the vermouth.     

07:24.700 --> 07:26.500
      And I want a twist,       
         not an olive.          

07:26.600 --> 07:27.700
                 Very well, sir.

07:27.700 --> 07:29.200
Uh, uh, read                    
that back to me.                

07:29.300 --> 07:31.700
I don't want any mistakes.      

07:31.800 --> 07:35.100
          One martini, very dry.

07:35.100 --> 07:36.500
     You forgot the twist.      

07:36.600 --> 07:38.400
          Twist it is.          

07:38.400 --> 07:40.400
  I'll twist his big ears off.  

07:40.400 --> 07:42.700
  Take it easy, take it easy.   

07:42.800 --> 07:44.800
      He wants a very dry       
     martini with a twist.      

07:54.600 --> 07:56.500
What'd you do that for?         

07:56.600 --> 07:58.200
          It's nothing personal.

07:58.200 --> 08:01.200
                  I was just    
              letting off steam.

08:01.200 --> 08:03.600
Then why don't you              
push Norm off his stool?        

08:03.700 --> 08:05.400
             You don't know much
          about physics, do you?

08:09.700 --> 08:10.900
    Don't forget the twist!     

08:11.000 --> 08:11.700
Let me see my brochure.         

08:11.700 --> 08:13.500
I gotta get a look at my car.   

08:16.200 --> 08:17.200
                     Oh...      

08:17.300 --> 08:18.500
        Yes.                    
                     (laughs)   

08:18.500 --> 08:19.600
  Oh, it's worth it.            

08:19.700 --> 08:21.100
It's worth it.                  
                    Yeah.       

08:21.100 --> 08:22.800
      Carla, this must've       
fallen out of your folder.      

08:22.800 --> 08:24.300
It says "List of Judges."       

08:25.700 --> 08:27.000
    Are you kidding?            

08:27.100 --> 08:30.000
  That's supposed               
  to be top secret.             

08:30.000 --> 08:31.300
Oh, my God.                     

08:31.400 --> 08:33.900
This is the best thing          
that's ever happened to me.     

08:34.000 --> 08:35.100
I'm gonna know who they are.    

08:35.200 --> 08:37.600
Now all I have to do is         
kiss up to the squids           

08:37.700 --> 08:39.200
on that list and I'll           
be driving home                 

08:39.299 --> 08:40.500
in a nice, new convertible.     

08:40.500 --> 08:41.799
                    All right.  

08:41.900 --> 08:43.200
Who are they, Woody?            

08:43.200 --> 08:45.500
David Murphy, Cliff Clavin      

08:45.600 --> 08:46.800
and Frank Smith.                

08:48.600 --> 08:50.500
     (yells)                    

08:57.500 --> 08:59.500
Now, who is Frank Smith,        

08:59.600 --> 09:01.500
and why is Carla so mad at him? 

09:10.200 --> 09:12.900
                 And now, on top
             of everything else,

09:13.000 --> 09:15.800
              I've got this huge
         headache outta nowhere.

09:18.500 --> 09:20.800
              They picked Clavin
                to be a judge.  

09:20.900 --> 09:22.800
                 What could they
          have been thinking of?

09:24.500 --> 09:25.900
    Aw, they probably           
    want someone, you know,     

09:26.000 --> 09:27.200
  with lot of bar experience,   

09:27.300 --> 09:29.500
and he <i>has</i> been hanging         
around here a lot, you know.    

09:29.500 --> 09:30.600
     Yeah, well, so's Norm.     

09:30.600 --> 09:31.900
Why didn't they pick you, Norm? 

09:32.000 --> 09:32.900
     Well, maybe they did.      

09:33.000 --> 09:35.800
        I haven't opened        
      my mail in a while.       

09:35.900 --> 09:39.200
 Once my Unemployment ran out,  
  all the incentive was gone.   

09:39.300 --> 09:41.100
No doubt about it,              

09:41.200 --> 09:43.500
             these things were a
         lot easier on all of us

09:43.500 --> 09:47.100
                  when they were
            just bimbo contests.

09:47.200 --> 09:48.500
            You know, if this...

09:48.600 --> 09:50.800
             this is the new age
            of enlightenment,   

09:50.900 --> 09:53.200
                why, why does it
            hurt so many people?

09:58.800 --> 10:00.700
                Norm, I gotta   
             ask you a question.

10:00.700 --> 10:01.900
     All right.                 

10:01.900 --> 10:03.100
    You know, over the years,   

10:03.200 --> 10:05.300
            I've been pretty    
                bad to Clavin.  
    Mmm.                        

10:05.400 --> 10:06.700
            And I've done       
             some things that...

10:06.800 --> 10:08.500
         maybe I shouldn't have.

10:08.600 --> 10:10.500
     Mm-hmm.                    
            Called him names.   

10:10.600 --> 10:12.500
            Punctured his tires.

10:12.600 --> 10:14.100
        Set fire to his hair.   

10:14.200 --> 10:16.400
    What's the question?        

10:16.500 --> 10:17.500
        Do you think he noticed?

10:17.600 --> 10:18.900
    (snorts)                    

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
You made this guy               
    eat a bug once.             

10:22.100 --> 10:25.500
Come on, that's a birthday      
the guy's never gonna forget.   

10:25.600 --> 10:27.600
                 Okay, I'll send
                him flowers.    

10:27.600 --> 10:30.200
Carla, that bug laid            
eggs in his stomach.            

10:31.900 --> 10:34.000
                Yeah. That <i>was</i>  
                kind of a bonus.

10:35.600 --> 10:37.000
                Oh... God.      

10:37.100 --> 10:39.300
            I might as well just
            chop this phony bow.

10:39.400 --> 10:40.500
              Aww.              

10:40.600 --> 10:42.500
You're right, Norm.             
      It's hopeless.            

10:42.600 --> 10:43.700
I'm never gonna win anything.   

10:43.800 --> 10:45.200
                  Come on.      
    No, really.                 

10:45.300 --> 10:47.200
  You know, I thought           
    it was my turn.             

10:47.300 --> 10:49.200
  I thought that,               
for once in my life,            

10:49.300 --> 10:50.500
I was gonna be recognized       

10:50.600 --> 10:52.900
for being the best              
  at what I do.                 

10:52.900 --> 10:55.700
Now, because of Clavin,         
I don't even get the chance.    

10:55.800 --> 10:58.600
            All right, well, why
             don't you try this?

10:58.600 --> 11:00.400
      Actually be nice to Cliff.

11:00.500 --> 11:02.200
          Listen to his stories.

11:02.300 --> 11:04.200
        Treat him like a friend.

11:04.300 --> 11:05.500
                (laughs):       
                I'm sorry.      

11:05.500 --> 11:08.500
          It's the beer talking.

11:08.500 --> 11:09.800
        Well, that, uh, Paul,   
            in a nutshell,      

11:09.900 --> 11:12.800
             is the history     
        of Western civilization.

11:14.700 --> 11:16.500
                  You were right
                  to come to <i>me.</i>

11:16.600 --> 11:17.800
I didn't come to you, Cliff.    

11:17.900 --> 11:20.400
I was, uh, waiting              
to use the phone.               

11:24.800 --> 11:25.900
Go on, Cliff.                   

11:25.900 --> 11:27.100
I'm listening.                  

11:27.200 --> 11:29.500
      I'm interested            
 in Western civilization.       

11:29.600 --> 11:31.500
     You all right, Carla?      

11:32.600 --> 11:33.800
  Beat it, lard butt!           

11:35.900 --> 11:38.100
      Thank God. I thought      
      I was hallucinating.      

11:41.100 --> 11:42.000
                Interested, huh?

11:42.100 --> 11:43.400
Oh, yeah!                       
                That's funny.   

11:43.400 --> 11:45.500
              You, uh, you never
          listened to me before.

11:45.500 --> 11:48.200
        I listen to you         
      all the time, Cliff.      

11:48.300 --> 11:50.100
Yeah, as a matter of fact,      

11:50.100 --> 11:52.600
        I often go home         
    and tell the kids           

11:52.600 --> 11:55.500
        about this very,        
    very smart man at work.     

11:55.600 --> 11:58.200
      Why are you so mean       
      to me all the time?       

11:58.300 --> 11:59.900
             Mean?              

12:00.000 --> 12:03.700
 Well, like when you knocked me 
        off that stool.         

12:03.700 --> 12:06.300
    Knocked... Oh, no!          

12:06.400 --> 12:08.400
     Oh, no, that was just      
     an affectionate nudge,     

12:08.500 --> 12:12.200
you, you old silly billy.       

12:20.700 --> 12:23.500
    Well, that, that did sort   
                 of hurt my back

12:23.600 --> 12:24.900
                a little bit.   
        Oh...                   

12:25.000 --> 12:29.100
     You know, I wondered if you
    might... Uh, no, never mind.

12:29.100 --> 12:30.200
          I could never ask you.

12:30.300 --> 12:32.100
         Oh, no, Cliff.         

12:32.200 --> 12:34.700
Uh, would you like me to get you
    something for your back?    

12:34.800 --> 12:37.600
        Some, uh, heating pad   
        or some Doan's Pills?   

12:37.700 --> 12:39.800
Well, well,                     
you know a little,              

12:39.900 --> 12:43.100
uh, back rub might help         
a little.                       

12:43.200 --> 12:45.300
        Wouldn't you rather have
                a heating pad   

12:45.300 --> 12:47.300
        or some Doan's Pills?   

12:47.300 --> 12:50.300
Right there between             
the, uh, scapuli.               

12:55.600 --> 12:57.600
         Why, uh, sure.         

13:03.400 --> 13:07.100
Oh, that feels good.            

13:10.000 --> 13:11.600
Ah! You know, Carla,            
what the heck.                  

13:11.700 --> 13:13.200
I'll just take off my shirt     

13:13.300 --> 13:15.400
             and you can come in
              the office with me

13:15.500 --> 13:16.800
                and really knead
                      the flesh.

13:18.900 --> 13:22.000
  (makes tire squealing sound)  

13:24.000 --> 13:29.100
    Okay. But if I'm not out    
    of there in 15 minutes,     

13:29.200 --> 13:31.400
      nail that door shut,      
          call my kids          

13:31.500 --> 13:34.200
      and tell them I died      
    in a hideous explosion.     

13:34.300 --> 13:36.700
      I wouldn't want them      
    to know the truth.          

13:41.600 --> 13:42.900
            (sighs)             

13:44.300 --> 13:46.000
    How's that painting job     
      coming along, Norm?       

13:46.000 --> 13:47.700
    Ah, swear to God,           

13:47.800 --> 13:49.800
  I would be in there painting  
    this very moment,           

13:49.900 --> 13:51.100
but, uh, Carla's using the room.

13:51.100 --> 13:52.300
 She's giving Cliff a massage.  

13:52.400 --> 13:55.000
 Oh, please!                    

13:57.700 --> 13:59.000
Give me a break.                

14:00.700 --> 14:02.000
    Oh, dear.                   

14:04.400 --> 14:05.600
              See?              

14:05.700 --> 14:08.400
Yes, I see.                     

14:08.400 --> 14:10.500
Now if you could just get       
    the rest of that office     

14:10.600 --> 14:13.100
    half as white as Cliff's    
upper body, I'd be happy.       

14:14.500 --> 14:17.500
Woody, a beer for Cliff, please.

14:17.500 --> 14:19.300
                        And, uh,

14:19.400 --> 14:24.300
I have to get, four,            
five, six pretzels              

14:24.400 --> 14:28.300
with the salt brushed off       
just one side.                  

14:33.500 --> 14:36.300
(sobbing):                      
I touched his skin!             

14:37.800 --> 14:39.700
Oh, horror, horror!             

14:43.500 --> 14:46.800
    You might pretend           
 it's something less repulsive. 

14:49.100 --> 14:54.300
Less, less repulsive than       

14:54.400 --> 14:57.300
             Cliff's naked back?

14:57.400 --> 15:00.700
                    Oh! You mean
              like a dead animal

15:00.800 --> 15:02.400
            lying on the side   
                     of the road

15:02.400 --> 15:03.600
         squirming with maggots?

15:05.200 --> 15:07.800
     Precisely. Visualize.      

15:07.900 --> 15:10.300
                      Visualize!

15:10.400 --> 15:11.500
                        Yeah!   

15:11.600 --> 15:13.200
          I think that can work.

15:13.300 --> 15:15.100
                    Thanks, Doc.

15:15.100 --> 15:16.800
              It's only maggots.

15:16.900 --> 15:17.900
    It's only maggots.          

15:20.300 --> 15:21.500
 Boy, that Carla sure is smart, 

15:21.600 --> 15:23.900
buttering up to Mr. Clavin      
         so she'll win.         

15:24.000 --> 15:25.300
Wish I'd had those smarts       

15:25.300 --> 15:28.500
when I was doing the county fair
 circuit with my hog Maribelle. 

15:28.500 --> 15:31.300
        Rule number one:        
      you got to schmooze.      

15:33.000 --> 15:34.400
          You gotta go          
     to the right parties.      

15:34.500 --> 15:36.100
      You gotta sell out.       

15:36.200 --> 15:37.000
          I wouldn't.           

15:37.100 --> 15:40.500
  So I brought Maribelle home   
            a loser.            

15:40.600 --> 15:41.600
    It broke my heart.          

15:41.700 --> 15:43.800
    How was Maribelle?          

15:43.900 --> 15:46.000
    Not bad with applesauce.    

15:53.600 --> 15:56.400
    Carla, you've really got    
     strong, peasant hands.     

15:59.000 --> 16:00.400
    Thank you, Cliff.           

16:00.500 --> 16:02.300
            It's really quite   
            a refreshing change,

16:02.400 --> 16:04.400
                  you being nice
          to me all of a sudden.

16:04.500 --> 16:07.700
It's not all of a sudden.       

16:07.800 --> 16:10.600
It's like when                  
you're in third grade           

16:10.700 --> 16:14.400
when you tease the boy          
you secretly like the most.     

16:16.400 --> 16:19.300
 You mean the whole third grade 
    secretly liked me?          

16:21.500 --> 16:23.200
Forget it.                      

16:23.200 --> 16:27.400
 Wait a minute, Carla, are you  
trying to say you like me?      

16:27.500 --> 16:31.000
Well...                         

16:31.000 --> 16:33.100
Oh, come on, don't be shy.      

16:33.100 --> 16:34.200
            Say it.             

16:34.200 --> 16:36.400
        Say it so               
     the guys can hear it.      

16:41.300 --> 16:42.700
          I like you.           

16:42.800 --> 16:43.800
        I said it.              

16:45.700 --> 16:47.900
Doc, I feel like                
I'm gonna explode.              

16:48.000 --> 16:48.900
What should I do?               

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
                Find some way to
            release the tension.

16:51.100 --> 16:52.100
Good thinking.                  

16:53.000 --> 16:54.300
            Oh! Oh!             

16:56.100 --> 16:58.000
         Oh, thank you.         
I feel a lot better. Thank you. 

16:58.100 --> 16:59.400
                          Carla,

16:59.500 --> 17:02.200
 you know, you did such a good  
     job with the back rub,     

17:02.300 --> 17:04.900
    now my feet are jealous.    

17:09.200 --> 17:10.800
Allow me.                       

17:20.700 --> 17:23.900
    I rubbed his feet.          
    I rubbed his feet!          

17:24.000 --> 17:25.800
                Carla, Carla,   
                 Carla, come on.
                     Cut it out.

17:25.900 --> 17:27.400
             You've been washing
        your hands with kerosene

17:27.500 --> 17:29.300
            for half an hour.   
                  They're clean!

17:29.400 --> 17:30.600
No, not yet, Sam.               

17:30.700 --> 17:33.100
Get me a match.                 

17:33.200 --> 17:35.000
  Carla, it couldn't have been  
        that bad.               

17:35.100 --> 17:37.200
Like hell.                      

17:37.200 --> 17:38.500
         I didn't look,         

17:38.600 --> 17:41.500
  but I'm sure I felt six toes  
    on his left foot.           

17:44.000 --> 17:46.700
 If the judges will please come 
  forward and the contestants   

17:46.800 --> 17:48.000
    will take their places,     

17:48.100 --> 17:49.000
      we're ready to begin      

17:49.100 --> 17:53.900
  the 53rd Annual Miss Boston   
        Barmaid Contest.        

17:54.000 --> 17:55.200
  Uh, uh, I'll be right there.  

17:55.300 --> 17:58.100
     I'm just gonna go get      
        the other judge.        

17:58.200 --> 17:59.300
    What other judge?           

17:59.400 --> 18:00.600
         Cliff Clavin.          

18:00.700 --> 18:02.500
      Sorry. I don't know       
        a Cliff Clavin.         

18:02.500 --> 18:06.900
  Well, what, what about this?  

18:06.900 --> 18:09.100
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.            

18:09.200 --> 18:10.300
That's not official.            

18:10.400 --> 18:12.200
Someone must be                 
having fun with you.            

18:16.600 --> 18:17.200
                 Hey, uh, Carla,

18:17.400 --> 18:20.100
                you still got   
              that little brush?

18:20.200 --> 18:22.800
Uh, you left a couple           
of crumbs on my mustache.       

18:27.700 --> 18:29.300
  You know, Cliff, uh, I think  

18:29.400 --> 18:31.300
         you, uh, ought         
     to keep those crumbs.      

18:31.400 --> 18:33.700
They're gonna need 'em          
to identify your body.          

18:33.800 --> 18:36.000
You set me up!                  

18:36.100 --> 18:38.200
You put your name               
on that list                    

18:38.300 --> 18:40.300
just so that I would            
be nice to you!                 

18:40.300 --> 18:42.200
             EMCEE:             
     Contestant number one?     

18:42.300 --> 18:46.600
(sweetly):                      
Yes?                            

18:46.700 --> 18:48.600
If you'll take your place       

18:48.600 --> 18:50.300
with the other contestants      
         we can begin.          

18:50.800 --> 18:51.700
                        (groans)

18:51.800 --> 18:54.100
I have to go be in              
the contest now, Cliff.         

18:54.100 --> 18:57.100
Why don't you make              
your peace with God?            

19:00.200 --> 19:01.400
                  Are you nuts?!

19:01.500 --> 19:03.900
    Did you think you were gonna
    actually get away with that?

19:04.000 --> 19:05.800
            You know you're dead
                 now, don't you?

19:05.900 --> 19:07.800
Eh, I know, Norm.               

19:07.900 --> 19:10.000
    Some men have a mission.    

19:10.000 --> 19:11.700
 Uh, guys climb Mount Everest.  

19:11.800 --> 19:13.900
  Other guys walk on the moon.  

19:13.900 --> 19:15.500
        Yeah, either of those   
          would be a pretty good

19:15.600 --> 19:17.000
                hiding place for
                  you right now.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
  I topped them all, yessiree.  

19:20.100 --> 19:21.600
 I had Carla rub my bare feet.  

19:21.700 --> 19:23.400
I'm gonna have that etched      
on my tombstone.                

19:23.500 --> 19:26.000
        You can start working   
        on it just about now.   

19:28.000 --> 19:29.300
Contestant number one,          
you're first.                   

19:29.400 --> 19:33.500
Our first category will be speed
followed by memorization,       

19:33.600 --> 19:34.500
        personal warmth,        

19:34.600 --> 19:36.900
courtesy                        
and drink knowledge.            

19:36.900 --> 19:39.600
            SAM (high voice):   
    What about the bikini round?

19:39.700 --> 19:42.400
We're well aware                
of your views, Mr. Malone.      

19:49.300 --> 19:51.900
 And now let the contest begin. 

20:49.700 --> 20:52.500
             EMCEE:             
        Thank you.              
    Very nicely done.           

20:52.600 --> 20:55.300
That concludes our competition. 

20:55.400 --> 20:56.800
As the judges tally their votes,

20:56.900 --> 20:58.400
     let's have a big round     
          of applause           

20:58.500 --> 20:59.700
  for all of our contestants.   

21:03.500 --> 21:04.700
                          Sammy,
You did great.                  

21:04.800 --> 21:06.800
          oh, Sammy, I've really
             got a shot at this.

21:06.800 --> 21:07.500
             Yeah.              

21:07.600 --> 21:08.900
 You know, I hate to admit it,  

21:09.000 --> 21:10.800
    but I think it might be     
    because of you, Clavin.     

21:10.900 --> 21:12.100
            What do you mean?   

21:12.100 --> 21:15.100
Well, I took all that energy    
I was gonna use to kill you,    

21:15.200 --> 21:17.900
and I put it into doing         
the best job I could.           

21:17.900 --> 21:18.900
        Oh, yeah, yeah, well,   

21:19.000 --> 21:21.500
         then my secret strategy
                    worked, huh?

21:21.600 --> 21:23.100
                Well, I hope you
        enjoy the car, Carla.   

21:23.200 --> 21:25.100
      And, uh, just remember who
        made it all possible.   

21:25.200 --> 21:27.100
             EMCEE:             
    If the contestants          
     will please be seated.     

21:27.200 --> 21:30.200
     Ladies and gentlemen,      
    we have a winner.           

21:30.300 --> 21:32.700
Oh, it's me, it's me,           
it's me, I feel it!             

21:32.800 --> 21:36.700
 The proud owner of a brand-new 
    1991 convertible,           

21:36.800 --> 21:40.400
and our new Miss Boston Barmaid 
             is...              

21:40.400 --> 21:41.500
      Miss Shawnee Wilson!      

21:47.300 --> 21:49.000
But she spilled all the drinks. 

21:49.100 --> 21:50.700
    Who cares? Look at her.     

21:50.700 --> 21:52.500
                I won! I won!   
                          I won!

21:52.600 --> 21:55.300
      I won! I won! I won!      

21:55.400 --> 21:55.900
        No, no, you won!        

21:56.000 --> 21:58.300
         I won! I won!          
             I won!             

22:01.700 --> 22:04.200
      And let's not forget      
  our Miss Congeniality award.  

22:04.200 --> 22:08.100
  It goes to contestant number  
    one, Cheers' own Carla.     

22:12.500 --> 22:13.500
That's quite a big trophy, miss.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.100
  I hope you have room for it.  

22:15.200 --> 22:16.800
        I'll make room.         

22:18.200 --> 22:19.600
          Mr. Mailman!          

22:19.700 --> 22:21.200
                Oh, look out!   

22:27.900 --> 22:30.500
                I'm so happy you
            won that contest.   

22:30.600 --> 22:32.300
         You know, it just shows

22:32.300 --> 22:33.900
                  that the world
              hasn't gone crazy.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.800
                 That, you know,
              deep, deep inside,

22:36.900 --> 22:38.600
      people are basically good.

22:38.700 --> 22:42.000
            That they can see   
            through the rules   
            and the regulations,

22:42.100 --> 22:44.700
          you know, and pick out
              the inner diamond.

22:44.700 --> 22:46.500
I won the shiny red car.        

22:46.600 --> 22:48.800
          I know you did, honey!

22:50.000 --> 22:52.600
      Woody, where's Norm?      

22:52.700 --> 22:53.900
     Is he in the bathroom?     

22:54.000 --> 22:55.300
              No.               

22:55.300 --> 22:56.400
      Is he putting money       
         in the meter?          

22:56.400 --> 22:57.500
              No.               

22:57.600 --> 23:00.900
Don't tell me he is actually... 

23:01.000 --> 23:02.400
     (bang, hissing sound)      

23:02.400 --> 23:04.500
             NORM:              
             Whoa!              

23:06.100 --> 23:07.400
        (hissing stops)         

23:12.800 --> 23:14.200
                Relax.          

23:14.300 --> 23:17.300
  It-it-it dries much lighter.
