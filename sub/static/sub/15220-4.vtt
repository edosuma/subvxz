00:24.257 --> 00:26.657
(woman narrator)
Theorizing that one
could time-travel

00:26.726 --> 00:28.284
within his own lifetime,

00:28.428 --> 00:31.989
Dr. Sam Beckett stepped into
the Quantum Leap Accelerator

00:32.098 --> 00:33.087
and vanished.

00:38.238 --> 00:41.401
He woke to find himself
trapped in the past,

00:41.474 --> 00:44.375
facing mirror images
that were not his own,

00:44.477 --> 00:46.672
and driven
by an unknown force

00:46.746 --> 00:48.839
to change history
for the better.

00:49.783 --> 00:54.345
His only guide
on this journey is Al,
an observer from his own time

00:54.421 --> 00:56.685
who appears in the form
of a hologram

00:56.756 --> 00:58.986
that only Sam
can see and hear.

00:59.259 --> 01:03.218
And so Dr. Beckett
finds himself
leaping from life to life,

01:03.663 --> 01:06.496
striving to put right
what once went wrong,

01:06.599 --> 01:11.502
and hoping each time
that his next leap
will be the leap home.

01:12.672 --> 01:14.264
[Roaring]

01:16.309 --> 01:18.004
[Sam exclaims]

01:19.012 --> 01:21.071
Snowball. Good boy.

01:21.181 --> 01:22.375
Don't worry, Karl.

01:22.449 --> 01:25.543
Lions never eat photographers,
they give them indigestion.

01:25.618 --> 01:29.520
Though I understand
they nibble at the slow ones
now and again.

01:31.691 --> 01:33.215
[Roaring]

01:36.129 --> 01:37.858
Oh, boy.

02:54.307 --> 02:55.535
Nice kitty.

02:55.909 --> 02:58.343
Nice little kitty-cat.

02:58.411 --> 02:59.639
[Panting]

03:08.955 --> 03:10.582
[Lion growling]

03:13.293 --> 03:15.261
Really, Karl.
Vanity is one thing,

03:15.328 --> 03:17.853
but self-obsession
is positively boring.

03:18.231 --> 03:20.756
Yeah, well, I was just, uh...

03:20.900 --> 03:22.697
No, I was just checking
the lighting.

03:22.769 --> 03:23.758
[Man exclaims]

03:25.405 --> 03:28.135
And I think they need
some readjustment.

03:28.441 --> 03:29.703
(Mike)
Or burial.

03:29.842 --> 03:31.571
Is this going to be long?

03:32.178 --> 03:33.440
My feet are killing me.

03:33.513 --> 03:34.502
[Roaring]

03:34.581 --> 03:37.982
No. No, just, uh...
Everybody, why don't we just

03:38.184 --> 03:40.345
take a break
for a couple minutes or so.

03:40.420 --> 03:41.444
Thank you.

03:41.521 --> 03:44.285
(Mike)
Reloading.
Regurgitating.

03:44.891 --> 03:46.153
Retiring.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.591
[People chattering]

03:48.061 --> 03:49.187
[Lion roaring]

03:50.630 --> 03:52.097
You're doing great.

03:52.165 --> 03:53.154
[Chuckles]

03:54.234 --> 03:55.701
I don't know
what's wrong with her.

03:55.768 --> 03:57.793
Usually she's like...
She's like wow!

03:58.404 --> 04:00.497
(Mike)
But these last few days...

04:00.673 --> 04:04.973
Favors,
even for old time's sake,
can only go so far.

04:05.445 --> 04:07.811
I'm not paying
for reshoots.

04:08.114 --> 04:11.811
I don't know.
Maybe we should've gone
with that girl, Cheryl Tiegs

04:11.884 --> 04:13.351
or Twiggy.

04:13.419 --> 04:15.785
Byron, Edie is just fine.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.719
She's just a little tired.

04:17.790 --> 04:19.882
She's been tired
since we begun.

04:19.959 --> 04:23.918
She probably stayed up late
watching bad
television commercials.

04:24.964 --> 04:28.297
Oh, that's very nice.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

04:29.002 --> 04:30.333
Thank you.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.002
[Clears throat]

04:32.705 --> 04:33.797
How're you feeling?

04:33.873 --> 04:34.931
I'm fine.

04:35.475 --> 04:37.340
Hmm. That's
interesting.

04:37.710 --> 04:39.575
'Cause you look like
a little country girl

04:39.646 --> 04:42.410
who's tired from a long day
of milking cows.

04:43.549 --> 04:44.538
[Sighing]

04:44.651 --> 04:47.677
Right now,
Byron is about
two heartbeats away

04:47.754 --> 04:49.312
from calling
Stuart Cowley

04:49.389 --> 04:51.949
and replacing you
with Cheryl Tiegs

04:52.025 --> 04:54.323
if you don't get out there
and show some shine.

04:54.527 --> 04:56.552
I've been shining all day.

05:00.133 --> 05:04.263
Now, I don't know
what your problem is.

05:05.371 --> 05:06.668
But whatever it is,

05:06.739 --> 05:08.639
you have to get
over it quick.

05:09.242 --> 05:10.334
Here.

05:11.044 --> 05:12.409
Take these.

05:14.580 --> 05:16.980
Helen, I can't
take them anymore.

05:17.550 --> 05:19.643
I don't sleep.
I don't eat.

05:19.819 --> 05:22.049
They're really
screwing me up.

05:24.824 --> 05:27.019
In case you
have forgotten,

05:27.260 --> 05:30.354
a lot of people
have paid you

05:30.496 --> 05:33.192
a mountain of money
to look good.

05:33.266 --> 05:35.666
Now, if you
don't wanna do that,

05:36.235 --> 05:38.328
I'll just go tell Byron.

05:38.404 --> 05:41.100
And Byron being
the good little adman
that he is

05:41.174 --> 05:43.699
will run to those
folks at Le Beast

05:43.876 --> 05:46.777
and we can both be
on the unemployment line.

05:48.514 --> 05:51.677
Come on, sweetie,
just think of them
like aspirin.

05:51.851 --> 05:52.977
Okay?

05:53.152 --> 05:55.347
They're going to
make you feel better.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.681
And I promise

05:58.091 --> 06:00.821
I will never ask you
to take them again.

06:02.128 --> 06:04.528
Come on,
I cross my heart.

06:04.597 --> 06:05.586
[Laughing]

06:07.867 --> 06:08.959
Okay.

06:09.302 --> 06:10.735
That's my girl.

06:10.837 --> 06:13.499
(Sam)
Quantum leaping is a lot
like looking at a picture.

06:13.573 --> 06:16.770
For an instant,
you recapture a moment
that's already occurred.

06:17.143 --> 06:18.201
(Sam)
Oh, boy.

06:18.277 --> 06:20.040
But it doesn't help you
take the picture.

06:20.113 --> 06:22.047
Well, if it's...
If it's that good,
why don't you

06:22.115 --> 06:23.980
just go ahead
and take the picture?

06:24.050 --> 06:25.039
[Laughing]

06:26.285 --> 06:27.877
Yep, okay, sure.

06:30.490 --> 06:31.855
(Sam)
Come on, come on,
let's go.

06:36.195 --> 06:37.287
(Sam)
Okay.

06:37.964 --> 06:39.363
Everybody, uh,

06:40.233 --> 06:41.598
say cheese.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.597
Well, that was perfect.

06:44.670 --> 06:46.433
All right, okay.
That's it.

06:46.506 --> 06:47.530
Thank you
very much.

06:47.640 --> 06:49.107
What? Wait.
Why... What...
Wait.

06:50.209 --> 06:51.198
That's it?

06:51.344 --> 06:52.333
Well, you know...

06:52.879 --> 06:54.608
You know,
it only takes one.

06:54.680 --> 06:58.309
And when you got that one,
then you definitely
have got it.

06:58.384 --> 06:59.408
And that's it.

06:59.485 --> 07:00.509
[Tittering]

07:00.586 --> 07:04.147
Yes, listen to him, Byron,
he's trying to save you money.

07:04.557 --> 07:07.924
I can't remember
when I've seen him
so generous.

07:08.895 --> 07:09.987
[Lion growling]

07:10.062 --> 07:11.393
(Byron)
Well, we...

07:11.464 --> 07:13.625
We obviously
got the one there,
and that was the one.

07:13.699 --> 07:16.395
And... and thank you.
That's beautiful.
That's a wrap.

07:16.469 --> 07:19.370
Very good work.
Thank you. Love you.

07:19.472 --> 07:21.372
Hey, see you tomorrow, Karl.

07:22.108 --> 07:23.541
(Edie)
Ciao. Ciao-ciao.

07:24.010 --> 07:26.274
(Edie)
Yes, darling,
that was wonderful.

07:26.345 --> 07:28.870
Karl, could you
give me a lift home?

07:29.248 --> 07:30.772
Yeah, sure,
no... no problem.

07:30.850 --> 07:32.613
Great. I'll be ready
in just a second.

07:32.685 --> 07:34.983
(man)
Good boy, Snowball,
let's go home.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.819
[Siren wailing]

07:46.098 --> 07:48.794
Uh, you can just
throw that stuff anywhere.

07:49.268 --> 07:51.566
(Edie)
Hi. Hi, guys,
I'm home now.

07:51.637 --> 07:53.002
[Cats mewing]

07:53.139 --> 07:57.337
Yes. You weren't
very hungry today,
were you? No.

07:57.577 --> 07:59.442
[Cats mewing]

08:00.179 --> 08:01.271
Okay.

08:02.215 --> 08:03.614
You like cats?

08:03.683 --> 08:04.945
Uh, little ones.

08:05.585 --> 08:09.146
In fact I had
two of them

08:09.222 --> 08:11.213
on the farm
when I grew up.

08:11.290 --> 08:13.019
Donder and Blitzen.

08:14.260 --> 08:15.249
[Laughs]

08:15.828 --> 08:17.295
Y-You grew up
on a farm, too?

08:17.363 --> 08:19.422
I th-thought you were
from Queens.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.864
I, uh, l... I am.

08:21.033 --> 08:23.524
Um, but what I meant
to say was that

08:23.669 --> 08:26.570
um, when I used to
visit my cousin,

08:26.939 --> 08:28.804
uh, on his farm
in the country,

08:29.208 --> 08:31.438
he had the cats
in the summer.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.034
Well, one or two.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.714
Well, when I moved here,
I just had to have something

08:35.780 --> 08:38.078
that reminded me
of my family and home.

08:38.683 --> 08:40.708
That's why I love Wooster.

08:41.053 --> 08:42.850
Doesn't it get
a little crowded
around here

08:42.922 --> 08:44.685
with Wooster and... and
his little friends?

08:44.757 --> 08:46.349
[Laughs]

08:46.459 --> 08:48.927
I know I could afford
a bigger place.

08:48.995 --> 08:50.462
But I'm saving up my money.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.361
I don't wanna
be a model forever.

08:52.598 --> 08:54.327
Y-Y-You're...

08:55.635 --> 08:57.660
You're... You're gonna
go back home?

08:58.638 --> 09:01.801
Yeah, and buy my dad
all the farm equipment
he wants.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.842
Maybe get him one
of these new combines.

09:03.910 --> 09:06.845
Oh, yeah, like
the self-propelled kind
from, uh, John Deere.

09:06.913 --> 09:07.937
Yeah.

09:08.014 --> 09:11.506
That my cousin
always used to talk about.

09:11.584 --> 09:14.018
And... and he still does
talk about 'em.

09:14.554 --> 09:15.646
Yeah.

09:16.322 --> 09:19.257
Then I'm going to send
my sister to college.

09:19.458 --> 09:21.153
She'll be the first
Lansdale to go.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.558
That's great.

09:22.628 --> 09:25.188
What about you?
What're you gonna
spend on yourself?

09:25.831 --> 09:27.093
I don't know.
I thought

09:27.166 --> 09:28.155
[cat purring]

09:28.267 --> 09:31.236
Maybe I'll go back to school
and become a veterinarian.

09:31.304 --> 09:34.432
Yeah, that way I can
take care of Wooster
when he's old and gray.

09:34.507 --> 09:37.533
Well, l... I have a feeling
he's gonna be a handful.

09:38.210 --> 09:39.700
Oh, I know.
He isn't really, though.

09:39.779 --> 09:42.407
I mean, lots of people
think that cats
are really picky

09:42.481 --> 09:45.245
but I think cats are just
looking for love.

09:45.451 --> 09:48.386
Yeah, well,
I'm sure that he's...

09:48.487 --> 09:52.446
Comes from a long line
of, uh, uh, heartbreakers.

09:52.792 --> 09:54.885
I don't know
where he comes from.

09:54.961 --> 09:57.122
Outer space, I think.

09:57.897 --> 10:01.458
One second
I was, uh, fumbling
for my keys downstairs.

10:01.567 --> 10:02.898
Yeah?
And all of a sudden

10:02.969 --> 10:05.130
zoop, there he is.

10:05.204 --> 10:07.968
Just like he just
leaped in out of nowhere.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.634
You got to be careful
when you do that.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.507
[Muttering]
I always tell myself.

10:13.412 --> 10:15.505
So there he was, all alone.

10:15.648 --> 10:17.013
No friends. No family.

10:17.149 --> 10:18.548
And no place to go.

10:19.051 --> 10:21.246
Just like I was
when I first came to New York.

10:21.320 --> 10:23.288
I had to take him in.

10:23.856 --> 10:25.187
Lucky guy.

10:25.391 --> 10:26.858
[Siren wailing in distance]

10:27.193 --> 10:28.922
[Wooster mewing]

10:30.963 --> 10:32.692
Oh, I...

10:32.999 --> 10:34.990
Well, I meant t-that if I...

10:35.067 --> 10:37.262
If I was the cat,
then I would want...

10:38.304 --> 10:39.293
[sputtering]

10:39.438 --> 10:41.099
I mean, you know, uh...

10:41.173 --> 10:43.300
I mean, there are worse things
that can happen to you

10:43.376 --> 10:45.867
than... than... than to be
taken in by a beautiful...

10:46.412 --> 10:49.677
I mean, this place is nicer
than... than living
on the street, is what...

10:49.749 --> 10:51.979
Would you please
stop me? Please?

10:52.051 --> 10:53.882
[Laughing]
Why? You're on
such a roll here.

10:53.953 --> 10:55.477
Yeah, right downhill, too.

10:56.389 --> 10:57.754
[Edie laughing]

10:58.324 --> 10:59.313
[Laughs]

10:59.825 --> 11:01.292
So, anyway,

11:01.594 --> 11:03.425
um, Wooster found you

11:03.496 --> 11:08.399
and, um, you've become
this patron saint
for lost cats?

11:08.668 --> 11:12.570
Well, everybody needs someone
to look out for them.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.273
I mean, If it hadn't been
for Helen,

11:15.341 --> 11:17.332
I probably would've
wound up like Wooster.

11:17.410 --> 11:19.037
Helen, your boss?

11:19.211 --> 11:20.940
Oh, she's more
than just that.

11:21.113 --> 11:25.243
Ever since I moved here,
she's been like a mother.

11:26.185 --> 11:28.085
I really owe her a lot.

11:31.490 --> 11:33.481
Speaking of your mother,

11:33.559 --> 11:35.891
y-you never told me
what you were gonna
get for her.

11:35.961 --> 11:37.360
Your dad's
gonna get the combine.

11:37.430 --> 11:38.863
Your sister's
gonna go to school.

11:38.931 --> 11:41.263
No, no, don't tell me,
let me guess. Um,

11:43.369 --> 11:44.358
dishwasher.

11:44.437 --> 11:46.564
A dishwasher,
so she doesn't have
to wreck her hands

11:46.639 --> 11:48.800
washing them anymore.

11:49.241 --> 11:51.766
My mother passed away
when I was 13.

11:52.611 --> 11:53.942
I'm sorry.

11:56.248 --> 11:57.647
Well, um,

11:58.050 --> 12:01.076
thanks for bringing
my stuff in.

12:02.722 --> 12:07.159
Um, yeah, sure.
Sure, um, a-anytime.

12:09.995 --> 12:12.225
I'm sure she was
really great.

12:13.199 --> 12:14.689
Yeah, she was.

12:18.237 --> 12:20.865
So, uh...

12:21.841 --> 12:22.830
Well,

12:24.677 --> 12:25.769
b-bye.

12:29.081 --> 12:31.549
Yeah. Yeah.

12:35.788 --> 12:36.982
Bye.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.254
[Sighing]

12:49.034 --> 12:50.626
[Sighs deeply]

12:59.178 --> 13:01.169
You reached
her face yet?

13:01.514 --> 13:03.141
I'm working on it.

13:05.417 --> 13:06.441
(Sam)
Al.

13:06.519 --> 13:07.508
[Mumbles]

13:07.586 --> 13:08.575
Al?

13:08.854 --> 13:09.843
I think...

13:09.922 --> 13:10.946
Al.

13:11.023 --> 13:12.183
What?

13:12.358 --> 13:14.155
I think I gotta do

13:15.127 --> 13:18.028
a... a photo shoot
tomorrow. I think.

13:18.397 --> 13:20.592
Yeah, I wish
it was for Playboy.

13:20.833 --> 13:21.822
Al!

13:21.901 --> 13:23.596
All right,
all right, Sam.
Come on.

13:23.669 --> 13:25.660
I mean, a man's
gotta have his dreams.

13:27.173 --> 13:31.542
(Al)
Ah, let's see,
your name is Karl Granson.

13:31.610 --> 13:32.634
[Electronic beep]

13:32.711 --> 13:33.678
I know that.

13:33.746 --> 13:36.442
(Al)
Yeah. And you're
a very popular high...

13:37.082 --> 13:38.106
[beeping]

13:38.184 --> 13:40.812
Fashion photographer
in New York City.

13:41.120 --> 13:43.918
You... you work for Vogue,
Harper's Bazaar, Life.

13:43.989 --> 13:45.286
You shoot for
all the biggies.

13:45.357 --> 13:48.019
Yeah, they're gonna
want to shoot me
after they see these photos.

13:48.093 --> 13:49.560
(Al)
Relax, Sam.

13:49.628 --> 13:53.496
High fashion, that stuff,
it's... it's pure attitude.

13:53.566 --> 13:56.160
All you do
is you act
so important

13:56.235 --> 13:57.725
that you don't have
to do anything.

13:57.803 --> 13:59.430
And your assistant
sets everything up.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.666
Well, maybe I should just
let my assistant shoot it.

14:01.740 --> 14:03.935
And pass up a chance
to work with all the girls?

14:04.009 --> 14:05.033
Are you crazy?

14:05.110 --> 14:06.372
Al, I can't believe
I'm here

14:06.445 --> 14:08.470
to do a summer
high-fashion spread

14:08.547 --> 14:09.809
or whatever they call it.

14:09.882 --> 14:11.816
(Al)
Hey, maybe...

14:11.884 --> 14:13.909
Maybe you're here
to get Sports Illustrated

14:13.986 --> 14:15.715
to shoot the first
swimsuit issue.

14:15.788 --> 14:17.722
Oh, that would be great,
let's... No.

14:17.790 --> 14:20.156
Damn it.
That happened in 1964

14:20.226 --> 14:22.888
and here we are,
June 15, 1965.

14:22.962 --> 14:24.827
(Sam)
Soon to be '66.

14:25.130 --> 14:27.530
If you don't
start telling me...

14:28.167 --> 14:29.134
Oh, okay all right.

14:29.368 --> 14:30.392
Ah,

14:30.469 --> 14:33.836
have you met a model
named Edie Lansdale?

14:34.707 --> 14:35.901
I met an Edie.

14:35.975 --> 14:38.944
Yeah, well, she... she works
for a modeling agency

14:39.011 --> 14:41.946
run by a woman
named Helen Le Baron.

14:42.014 --> 14:45.848
A woman, uh,
yeah, yeah, right.
A shark in nylons.

14:46.118 --> 14:47.676
Well, she must be
a hungry shark

14:47.753 --> 14:51.951
because, apparently,
her agency is teetering
on the brink of bankruptcy.

14:52.024 --> 14:54.458
Anyway, this Helen
was a big model in her time...

14:54.526 --> 14:56.084
Wai-wai-wai-wai-wait.

14:56.161 --> 14:57.253
Edie.
Edie?

14:57.529 --> 14:58.518
Yeah.
Oh.

14:58.831 --> 14:59.991
Okay.

15:01.901 --> 15:02.890
Uh-oh.

15:03.636 --> 15:06.161
In, uh, three
and a half days, uh,

15:06.739 --> 15:10.470
Edie overdoses
on a combination
of pills and alcohol.

15:13.846 --> 15:14.870
[Sighs]

15:21.020 --> 15:22.385
[People chattering]

15:27.059 --> 15:29.493
Sam, you don't want
that, uh, thing in there.

15:29.561 --> 15:31.995
Karl Granson would never
have schlock in his shoot.

15:32.064 --> 15:34.828
L... lt's got terminal uglies.
I think you want
to get rid of it.

15:34.900 --> 15:35.889
Uh...

15:36.335 --> 15:38.462
You know this isn't
gonna work. Thanks.

15:39.972 --> 15:41.837
Don't make up your
minds or anything, Karl,

15:41.907 --> 15:43.602
you might
start a precedent.

15:44.209 --> 15:46.541
I don't know anything
about being
a fashion photographer.

15:46.612 --> 15:49.046
That's all right.
I used to visit New York
in the '60s.

15:49.114 --> 15:51.048
I had some buddies
who were photographers.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.276
I used to visit the shoots.

15:52.351 --> 15:55.445
(Sam)
That's great, Al. But I got
to shoot this today, now.

15:55.521 --> 15:58.251
I mean, I've been
stalling around here
moving furniture and stuff

15:58.324 --> 16:01.157
for three hours.
They're getting nervous,
getting angry.

16:01.226 --> 16:02.591
Anytime, Karl.

16:04.163 --> 16:08.827
Just remember,
that it's 90% attitude,
10% talent.

16:09.134 --> 16:11.762
Just... just do
whatever I say,
and listen...

16:12.504 --> 16:13.630
Oh, wow.

16:13.872 --> 16:16.204
Karl, do you like
the pink better or the blue?

16:16.275 --> 16:18.300
Uh, the blue.

16:19.278 --> 16:21.007
It brings out your eyes more.

16:21.513 --> 16:23.811
Like, um, periwinkles.

16:24.149 --> 16:25.275
Periwinkles?

16:25.417 --> 16:26.975
(Edie)
I love periwinkles.

16:27.319 --> 16:29.753
We used to have them
all over the farm.

16:37.563 --> 16:39.861
I can't believe
she dies from an overdose.

16:39.932 --> 16:42.127
Well, Ziggy says it's 78%.

16:42.701 --> 16:45.465
Just keep an eye on her,
and in the meantime,

16:45.604 --> 16:48.732
Granson is the name
and photography...

16:48.841 --> 16:53.278
is the game.

16:53.345 --> 16:54.334
[Lion roaring]

16:55.114 --> 16:57.674
(Al)
Sam, you got to make things
come alive there.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.775
You got to tell them
how beautiful they look.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.945
Use "super" and "fabulous"
and words like that.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.716
"Fabulous"?
Yeah, go ahead.

17:04.056 --> 17:07.025
That's what they expect,
that's what they respond to.

17:07.259 --> 17:09.522
It's a disaster,
a disaster.

17:09.795 --> 17:10.954
Right.

17:15.501 --> 17:17.230
That looks great.

17:17.301 --> 17:18.290
Great.

17:18.369 --> 17:20.133
And fabulous.

17:20.204 --> 17:21.433
(Al)
Fabulous.

17:23.642 --> 17:25.439
Okay, hang... hang in there,
hang in there.

17:25.511 --> 17:27.775
Can you try it
with a little conviction?

17:28.380 --> 17:32.009
Yeah, that's great.
That's terrific. Super. Super.

17:32.084 --> 17:33.312
Here we go,
right here.

17:33.385 --> 17:35.819
Yeah, fantastic, fabulous.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.879
Ooh, right there,
right there, right there.

17:37.956 --> 17:38.888
Magnifique.

17:38.957 --> 17:39.946

17:40.025 --> 17:41.424

Yeah, here we go. Bueno!

17:42.094 --> 17:43.118
(Sam)
Bueno!

17:43.195 --> 17:45.459
Have Edie move
a bit to her right.

17:45.531 --> 17:47.726
Edie, uh, move a smidge
to your right.

17:49.635 --> 17:50.932
Yeah, great.

17:51.003 --> 17:52.903
Tell Velvet to move
a smidge to her right.

17:52.971 --> 17:54.871
Velvet, move a smidge
to your right, too.

17:55.007 --> 17:56.804
That's terrific.
That's excellent.

17:56.875 --> 17:58.536
Now I wanna see
a little more bazongas.

17:58.610 --> 18:00.043
And a lot more...

18:00.479 --> 18:02.606
Give me some more teeth,
a lot more teeth.

18:02.681 --> 18:04.148
Yeah, that's great.

18:06.351 --> 18:08.148
Okay, that's looking
really, really great.

18:08.220 --> 18:09.915
Velvet, just lean
out a little bit more.

18:09.988 --> 18:11.182
Beautiful.

18:12.558 --> 18:14.924

just a little bit.

Yeah, that is great,
that is great.
Edie, you with me?

18:19.832 --> 18:21.527
No, she doesn't
look right, Sam.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.898
Stay with me, now,
we're almost done.

18:23.969 --> 18:26.369
Uh, Edie, try turning
this way. Look over here.

18:26.438 --> 18:27.996

Come on, give me
a little smile.

18:28.073 --> 18:29.335
There we go.

18:29.541 --> 18:31.600
All right, here we go.
We're almost near the end.

18:31.677 --> 18:33.736
Tuck your chin back in.
That's good, that's good.

18:33.812 --> 18:35.404
I think we should
take a break.

18:35.481 --> 18:38.382
All right, Edie, uh,
turn to the left

18:38.450 --> 18:40.611
and... and just look
over your shoulder at me.

18:40.686 --> 18:42.313
Drop your chin
a little bit.

18:42.387 --> 18:44.287
You should
take a break, Sam.

18:45.491 --> 18:47.459
What do you say
we all take five? Reload.

18:47.526 --> 18:48.720
Cool.

18:53.832 --> 18:55.094
Hello, sweetie.

18:57.736 --> 19:00.034
Close your eyes,
open your hand.

19:00.839 --> 19:01.931
Helen, you promised.

19:02.007 --> 19:03.838
I know, but I had
my fingers crossed.

19:04.009 --> 19:05.340
No.
Edie.

19:05.410 --> 19:07.901
You don't want to quit now,
not while you're ahead.

19:07.980 --> 19:11.541
Honey, Byron's ecstatic
about everything
that you're doing.

19:11.617 --> 19:13.448
You don't want
to blow it, do you?

19:14.086 --> 19:15.348
No.
No.

19:16.054 --> 19:18.488
Besides, we have
to take the clients out
for dinner tonight.

19:18.557 --> 19:21.219
You want to look your best
for them, don't you?
Doesn't she, Karl?

19:21.326 --> 19:23.089
Uh, Y-Yeah.
Absolutely.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.289

And if things get boring,
Karl can always tell

19:25.364 --> 19:27.264
one of his
wonderful stories.

Don't worry, I've got
a million of them.

19:31.637 --> 19:32.831
(Sam)
Oh, boy.

19:35.574 --> 19:37.542
You don't sound
exactly thrilled.

19:38.644 --> 19:39.633
Uh, well...

19:40.012 --> 19:43.812
Look,
it won't be a total loss,
as long as you're there.

19:46.084 --> 19:47.881
Why, fiddle-dee-dee.

19:49.054 --> 19:50.885
Beautiful.
All right, one more.
Now, Edie,

19:50.956 --> 19:53.720
keep your chin down
just a little bit.
Yeah, that's great.

19:53.792 --> 19:56.955
Great. Okay one more. I lied.
Here we go, and beautiful.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.053
That's wonderful.

19:58.130 --> 20:00.291
This is great, Al.
It's like painting
with people.

20:00.365 --> 20:04.096
Yeah, that's right, Sam,
and to be really great,
you gotta get inspired

20:04.169 --> 20:06.034
and find a way to do
the unexpected, like,

20:06.104 --> 20:08.197

at your command.

I want you and Geza

20:16.181 --> 20:17.739
to let all the birds
out of the cage.

20:17.816 --> 20:19.681
(Mike)
Wait. Do you know
what kind of mess...

20:19.785 --> 20:20.843

All right, you're the boss.

(Al)
Excellent attitude, Sam.
Excellent attitude.

20:24.856 --> 20:27.518
(Sam)
When the birds come out,
try and catch them, all right?

20:27.593 --> 20:29.720
Okay. Just reach up,
try and catch a bird
in your hand.

20:29.795 --> 20:32.025

I know it sounds weird.
Just try it, all right?

get ready, three.

for dessert?

two bottles.

You want something else?

21:14.773 --> 21:16.570
No, I'm just not hungry.

Are you sure? You didn't
eat anything at the shoot.

21:19.044 --> 21:20.671

when you do
a lot of amphetamines,

21:32.924 --> 21:34.084
you lose your appetite.

21:34.159 --> 21:36.525

and you get irritable.

maybe we should
call it a night.

36:46.337 --> 36:49.272
Helen, I can't take
those pills. I can't.

36:49.740 --> 36:51.970
I just need some coffee
and I'll be fine.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.601
Karl, where's the coffee?

36:53.678 --> 36:55.202
One coffee coming up.

36:55.446 --> 36:57.778
Just remember two words:
Cheryl Tiegs.

36:59.817 --> 37:01.842
Here, oh...
Two, uh, two sugars.

37:02.753 --> 37:04.880
[Lion growling]

37:07.625 --> 37:08.956
Here we go.

37:09.827 --> 37:10.816
Everything okay?

37:10.895 --> 37:14.797
Oh, yeah.
Everything's fine,
just fine.

37:21.038 --> 37:22.471
Are you all right?

37:23.207 --> 37:24.799
Everything's great.

37:27.278 --> 37:28.438
Thanks.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.411
Attagirl.

37:35.219 --> 37:36.208
[Lion roaring]

37:36.520 --> 37:38.454
[Mike yells]

37:38.990 --> 37:40.423
We got a hard eight.

37:41.359 --> 37:44.487
(Al)
If that was an inch closer,
you'd be calling him Lefty.

37:44.562 --> 37:45.722
Geza?

37:45.930 --> 37:48.228
Is it okay to shoot?
Is everything okay
with Snowball?

37:48.299 --> 37:50.494
(Geza)
He's okay, just
doesn't like the water.

37:55.606 --> 37:57.699
Good, Edie,
that's great. That's great.

38:02.046 --> 38:04.105
Yeah, yeah,
that's beautiful.

38:04.181 --> 38:05.910
(Sam)
Yeah. Go pour
the champagne.

38:06.117 --> 38:07.584
Yeah, that's right.

38:12.290 --> 38:13.985
(Helen)
Enjoy yourself, darling.

38:16.560 --> 38:17.925
That's beautiful.

38:19.263 --> 38:21.026
(Helen)
Karl, would you hurry up?

38:21.332 --> 38:22.356
[Roaring]

38:24.969 --> 38:26.368
(Helen)
That's a girl.

38:28.172 --> 38:29.537
Edie, be careful.

38:32.910 --> 38:34.172
That's wonderful, Edie.

38:34.312 --> 38:35.609
Edie, splash him some more.

38:37.715 --> 38:39.979
Continue shooting.
Give me the camera.

38:49.694 --> 38:51.628
[People screaming]

38:52.063 --> 38:53.496
(Sam)
Edie, get out of there!

38:53.564 --> 38:55.532
Somebody help!

39:02.006 --> 39:02.995
(Sam)
Edie!

39:03.407 --> 39:04.669
[Edie screaming]

39:07.011 --> 39:08.808
(Sam)
Run, Edie, run!

39:29.133 --> 39:30.930
(Al)
Sam, it's happening now!

39:31.035 --> 39:33.663
Somebody must've
slipped something
into her coffee.

39:41.846 --> 39:43.074
Snowball.

39:44.815 --> 39:46.077
Back.

39:48.452 --> 39:51.853
Stay, stay, easy. Easy.

39:52.623 --> 39:55.091
Sam, where'd you learn
to do that?

39:56.394 --> 39:57.725
Circus movies.

39:57.995 --> 39:59.860
I shouldn't have asked.

40:00.664 --> 40:02.154
I got his chain, Karl.

40:03.100 --> 40:04.727
Stay, Snowball.

40:06.871 --> 40:08.168
Stay. Come,
come, Snowball.

40:09.507 --> 40:10.974
Attaboy.

40:17.748 --> 40:19.739
You put something
in her coffee, didn't you?

40:19.817 --> 40:21.307
No, I didn't
give her anything.

40:21.385 --> 40:24.252
Like you didn't give anything
to Yvonne Moncrief?

40:24.455 --> 40:26.013
If Edie dies,
that's murder.

40:26.090 --> 40:28.786
And I'll make sure
that it sticks.
Now, what did you give her?

40:28.859 --> 40:29.791
I...

40:29.860 --> 40:30.952
Come on!

40:31.028 --> 40:34.725
I g-gave her some
black beauties
and some doors and fours.

40:34.799 --> 40:37.324
Black beauties are uppers.
Doors and fours are downers.

40:37.401 --> 40:38.629
I want to lie down.

40:38.702 --> 40:41.899
Sam, she's crashing.
She'll relax so much
her heart is going to stop.

40:41.972 --> 40:43.940
Come on, Edie.
You've got to walk.

40:44.008 --> 40:45.407
You've got to stay awake.

40:45.476 --> 40:47.137
Where's the nearest hospital?

40:47.211 --> 40:48.473
I don't... I don't know. I...

40:48.546 --> 40:51.242
It's 30 miles from here.
It'll take you 40 minutes
on these roads.

40:51.315 --> 40:53.374
Go find a phone,
call an ambulance.
Take the truck.

40:53.451 --> 40:54.475
Right.

40:54.552 --> 40:55.746
Is there anything we can do?

40:55.820 --> 40:59.415
Go to the equipment truck
and look for a first-aid kit
or something. All right?

40:59.757 --> 41:00.746
Come on.

41:01.692 --> 41:03.091
Go on, get out of here!

41:08.299 --> 41:09.891
Come on, talk to me.

41:09.967 --> 41:11.730
Sam, no. Not talk, walk.

41:11.802 --> 41:12.962
Come on.

41:13.437 --> 41:14.426
Edie.

41:17.174 --> 41:19.039
Edie, listen to me.

41:19.343 --> 41:20.970
Tell me about the farm.

41:21.111 --> 41:23.079
About becoming a vet.

41:23.414 --> 41:24.676
On the farm.

41:25.316 --> 41:26.874
(Edie)
Lots of cows.

41:28.118 --> 41:30.552
(Sam)
Cows, yeah. Well, yeah,
vets, you know, vets...

41:30.621 --> 41:33.215
Vets would see lots of cows.

41:33.791 --> 41:36.919
Edie, Edie, come on,
come on, come on.

41:37.228 --> 41:38.661
L-Look at that.
Look at that.

41:38.762 --> 41:42.698
Where would you like to go
to become a vet? Huh?
Where would you like to go?

41:43.701 --> 41:44.725
Indiana.

41:44.802 --> 41:47.635
Yeah. In... I'm from...

41:47.938 --> 41:49.963
My cousin is from Indiana.

41:50.040 --> 41:52.133
He grew up in Elk Ridge.

41:53.577 --> 41:55.306
(Edie)
Near Coopertown.

41:55.546 --> 41:56.877
(Sam)
You know Indiana?

41:56.947 --> 42:00.747
Yeah, Sam, her family's
been in Coopertown
for three generations.

42:01.752 --> 42:03.242
You remember
the County Fair,

42:03.354 --> 42:04.844
the Tri-County Fair
at Wittsburg?

42:04.922 --> 42:07.686
Remember that?
Wouldn't you like
to go there now?

42:08.225 --> 42:09.522
(Edie)
Pumpkins.

42:10.427 --> 42:13.396
(Sam)
Pumpkins, yeah, big pumpkins,
and pumpkin pie.

42:13.464 --> 42:16.331
Wouldn't you love
a piece of pumpkin pie
right now? Huh?

42:16.901 --> 42:17.959
Cold.

42:18.769 --> 42:20.532
(Sam)
Al, she's getting cold.

42:20.638 --> 42:21.969
Cold pie.

42:22.039 --> 42:23.028
Oh, cold pie.

42:23.274 --> 42:25.367
Edie, Edie. Al!

42:25.509 --> 42:26.806
Come on, come on,
come on.

42:26.877 --> 42:29.243
Sam, Ziggy says
she's got a 42%...

42:29.313 --> 42:32.476
Wait! It's going up! 43%.

42:32.550 --> 42:34.381
Sam, keep her going!

42:34.451 --> 42:35.440
Al?

42:36.253 --> 42:39.188
Uh, he is my dog, Al.
On the farm.

42:40.624 --> 42:41.989
Your dog?

42:43.561 --> 42:47.156
All right, it's up to 46%,
but I'm still insulted.

42:47.865 --> 42:49.924
(Edie)
What kind of dog?

42:50.134 --> 42:51.601
(Sam)
A great dog.

42:52.169 --> 42:54.535
The best friend
a guy could ever have.

42:54.905 --> 42:56.702
[Sam panting]

42:57.141 --> 42:58.574
Sounds nice.

42:59.810 --> 43:00.868
He is.

43:01.679 --> 43:03.647
52%. You did it, Sam.

43:03.714 --> 43:04.738
Yeah?

43:04.815 --> 43:05.839
(Al)
She's over the hump.

43:05.916 --> 43:07.008
Yes!

43:08.319 --> 43:09.786
[Laughing]

43:12.623 --> 43:15.456
You'll be fine, sweetie,
don't worry.

43:18.529 --> 43:21.191
Frank,
don't worry about this.

43:21.699 --> 43:22.791
Everything's
gonna be fine.

43:22.866 --> 43:25.027
I got so many other models
that are better than Edie.

43:25.102 --> 43:26.831
They're so much more
exciting than Edie.

43:26.904 --> 43:28.531
You know
that I've got...

43:28.706 --> 43:31.334
Irv, you know that I could
put this together.

43:32.876 --> 43:34.434
I know that you know...

43:34.511 --> 43:35.978
Look at these girls.
These girls...

43:36.046 --> 43:37.308
You want to do it,
don't you?

43:37.381 --> 43:39.144
I know you want to do it.
Look at...

43:39.216 --> 43:41.081
Look, I can
make you such a...

43:41.418 --> 43:42.646
[birds chirping]

43:44.254 --> 43:45.312
Byron.

43:46.523 --> 43:48.582
Byron, everything
is okay, isn't it?

43:48.659 --> 43:52.060
You know we can make things
all right again.
We put this together.

43:52.129 --> 43:54.597
That's right. I knew
you wouldn't leave me, Byron.

43:54.665 --> 43:56.223
I knew you...
Byron?

43:56.300 --> 43:57.289
Byron!

43:58.102 --> 44:00.263
Oh, I don't care!
I don't need you!

44:00.938 --> 44:02.667
I don't need any of you!

44:03.574 --> 44:04.905
I created her.

44:05.576 --> 44:06.941
And I can create
somebody else,

44:07.011 --> 44:08.535
because I did it.
I did it all!

44:09.179 --> 44:12.307
And I'll do it again.
I'll just do it all again.

44:12.950 --> 44:14.144
That's all right.

44:14.218 --> 44:15.651
There's plenty
of girls out there.

44:16.220 --> 44:17.414
[Whispering]
I'll do it.

44:17.821 --> 44:19.186
[Whispering]
I'll do it again.

44:21.191 --> 44:22.351
[Electronic buzzing]

44:25.629 --> 44:27.927
What're you doing here?
You're gonna miss your plane.

44:28.065 --> 44:29.259
No, no, I'm on my way.

44:29.333 --> 44:33.929
I just wanted to stop by
and thank you for everything.

44:34.405 --> 44:38.068
What are photographers for
if they can't help
their favorite models?

44:38.475 --> 44:39.806
I was just so stupid...

44:39.877 --> 44:41.276
No, no.
You weren't stupid.

44:41.712 --> 44:44.977
You just got tired
and made some bad choices.
We all do that.

44:45.049 --> 44:46.482
Oh, thank you.

44:51.689 --> 44:53.054
Well, I should go.

44:53.524 --> 44:54.513
Yeah.

44:54.725 --> 44:58.889
S-So do you ever
go back to Indiana
to visit your cousin?

44:59.997 --> 45:02.124
Uh, n-not as often
as I'd like to.

45:02.666 --> 45:05.191
Well, if I ever
run into him,
I'll say hello.

45:05.269 --> 45:07.032
Okay.
What's his name?

45:07.504 --> 45:08.596
Sam.

45:10.174 --> 45:11.334
Sam Beckett.

45:11.475 --> 45:12.772
It's a good name.

45:18.282 --> 45:19.943
Tell me something.

45:20.684 --> 45:22.311
How come you didn't...

45:23.787 --> 45:26.119
you know, that night
in my bedroom?

45:27.558 --> 45:29.219
Was I supposed to?

45:32.129 --> 45:33.619
I don't know.

45:34.598 --> 45:36.532
Well, I, um...

45:38.602 --> 45:40.069
I certainly wanted to.

45:55.352 --> 45:56.341
Well,

45:58.422 --> 45:59.719
goodbye.

46:01.024 --> 46:02.548
You take care.

46:10.567 --> 46:12.057
(Al)
Uh, Sam.

46:18.442 --> 46:21.343
L... I think you'll be
happy to know

46:21.411 --> 46:23.470
that everything
worked out just fine.

46:25.249 --> 46:27.012
I already know that.

46:27.317 --> 46:28.545
Yeah?
Yeah.

46:30.120 --> 46:31.747
She's going home.

46:35.959 --> 46:37.586
She's going home.
