WEBVTT

00:01.334 --> 00:02.668
Previously on "Alias"...

00:02.669 --> 00:05.536
I want satellite footage
of Tuscany.

00:06.673 --> 00:09.173
I want to know
who murdered my wife.

00:11.000 --> 00:17.074

00:24.457 --> 00:26.982
I'll see you at home
after I get the kids.

00:27.060 --> 00:29.560
- Good night.
- Good night, Diane.

00:32.031 --> 00:34.532
See you tomorrow.

00:49.949 --> 00:53.680
Where the hell's the device?
Tell me, or we're both dead!

00:53.753 --> 00:56.253
Dixon, what are you doing?

00:56.289 --> 00:57.790
Stay back, Sydney!

00:57.791 --> 01:00.521
- You're gonna kill yourself.
- I have nothing to lose!

01:00.593 --> 01:02.728
What the hell is your man doing?

01:02.729 --> 01:04.063
Disarm your explosive.

01:04.063 --> 01:05.731
Can you see them?

01:05.732 --> 01:08.292
- Negative.
- Dixon, think.

01:08.368 --> 01:09.568
Don't do this.

01:09.569 --> 01:11.970
- Sydney, get out!
- I'm not leaving without you.

01:11.971 --> 01:14.273
Dixon, I repeat.
Deactivate that weapon!

01:14.274 --> 01:16.475
Tell me where the box is,
or we die!

01:16.476 --> 01:19.411
- Base camp, I've got a visual.
- What's it gonna be?

01:19.479 --> 01:21.447
Tell Vaughn to take him down.

01:21.448 --> 01:23.115
Dixon could be holding
a detonator.

01:23.116 --> 01:25.517
Firing could trigger
the explosion.

01:25.518 --> 01:27.519
- Dixon, shut it down!
-15...

01:27.520 --> 01:28.754
14...

01:28.755 --> 01:30.689
Agent Bristow, I'm pulling rank.

01:30.690 --> 01:33.352
Agent Vaughn, this is
NSA Deputy Director Brandon.

01:33.426 --> 01:34.593
I am ordering you

01:34.594 --> 01:37.529
to take that shot
at first possible opportunity.

01:37.597 --> 01:38.797
Sydney, get out!

01:38.798 --> 01:42.063
Dixon, you must disarm now!

01:55.815 --> 02:00.013
# Do not stand at my grave
and weep #

02:02.088 --> 02:03.989
# I am not there #

02:03.990 --> 02:06.550
# I do not sleep #

02:08.928 --> 02:11.988
# I am a thousand winds
that blow #

02:12.065 --> 02:16.365
# I am the sunlight
on ripened grain #

02:21.674 --> 02:26.134
# I am a gentle autumn's rain #

02:28.114 --> 02:32.608
# I am the swift,
uplifting rush #

02:34.120 --> 02:38.489
# Of quiet birds
in circled flight #

02:48.468 --> 02:52.336
# Do not stand at my grave
and cry #

02:54.941 --> 02:59.537
# Do not stand at my grave
and cry #

03:01.714 --> 03:06.651
# Do not stand at my grave
and cry #

03:08.087 --> 03:10.088
I saw Dixon take something.

03:10.089 --> 03:12.024
What do you mean?

03:12.025 --> 03:13.392
Pills.

03:13.393 --> 03:17.193
He just looked like he was
barely holding it together.

03:17.263 --> 03:19.064
It could have been aspirin.

03:19.065 --> 03:21.590
It wasn't aspirin.

03:21.668 --> 03:23.202
What are you saying?

03:23.203 --> 03:26.229
He's going back to work days
after his wife was murdered,

03:26.339 --> 03:28.839
and he's self-medicating.

03:32.478 --> 03:35.072
I think he needs to feel
he's doing everything he can.

03:35.148 --> 03:37.648
To find Sloane?

03:38.851 --> 03:41.351
I did the same thing with Danny.

03:53.266 --> 03:55.367
I found the man
we're looking for.

03:55.368 --> 03:57.402
He lives in Panama City.

03:57.403 --> 03:59.903
I can be there in 17 hours.

03:59.973 --> 04:00.772
No.

04:00.773 --> 04:04.209
The CIA has a copy of the
database that Caplan decrypted.

04:04.310 --> 04:07.677
They'll deduce who it is we're
after if they haven't already.

04:07.747 --> 04:10.048
What do you suggest?

04:10.049 --> 04:13.177
I suggest you call this number.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.813
A recording will answer
for a limousine service.

04:15.888 --> 04:18.257
Leave your cell number only.

04:18.257 --> 04:22.024
Within five minutes,
a man will call you.

04:22.095 --> 04:25.030
You'll tell him
exactly what you need.

04:27.934 --> 04:30.630
Have you heard from Irina?

04:30.737 --> 04:34.173
She's in Cyprus,
inspecting some properties

04:34.274 --> 04:37.437
to take the place
of the facility in Spain.

04:37.510 --> 04:40.010
I see.

04:42.915 --> 04:46.043
I thought I would have
some measure of satisfaction

04:46.119 --> 04:48.619
with Diane Dixon's death.

04:53.593 --> 04:56.093
I killed the wrong person.

04:56.162 --> 04:58.662
Dixon?

04:59.766 --> 05:02.462
I'm taking a leave.

05:02.535 --> 05:05.035
I want you to continue
without me.

05:05.038 --> 05:08.940
Sir, not to belittle your grief,

05:09.008 --> 05:11.109
but do not deny yourself
the victory

05:11.110 --> 05:13.610
of a 30-year pursuit.

05:17.016 --> 05:20.816
If I don't see you again,
Mr. Sark,

05:20.887 --> 05:25.950
tell Irina that I hope you both
succeed where I couldn't.

05:27.994 --> 05:30.895
This is Frederick Brandon,
NSA Deputy Director.

05:30.963 --> 05:33.198
He's coordinating a task force

05:33.199 --> 05:35.759
to locate and study
Rambaldi's work.

05:35.835 --> 05:38.036
I'd like to say thank you
to all of you

05:38.037 --> 05:40.537
for welcoming
my associate and I.

05:40.606 --> 05:43.106
I'm Carrie Bowman,
Special Projects.

05:43.209 --> 05:45.677
Thanks to your technical
services specialist...

05:45.678 --> 05:48.178
it's a Mr. Flinkman...

05:48.181 --> 05:51.378
we've made a breakthrough
in the Rambaldi investigation.

05:51.451 --> 05:54.784
Really?
Uh, actually, I'm Flinkman.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.555
Marshall Flinkman.

05:56.556 --> 05:58.857
Hi.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.192
Hi.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.661
So while the CIA was
in possession

06:02.662 --> 06:04.629
of Rambaldi's study
of the heart,

06:04.630 --> 06:08.726
Mr. Flinkman cataloged
and copied it.

06:12.538 --> 06:15.507
Do you have a presentation?

06:15.608 --> 06:18.108
Hmm?

06:18.544 --> 06:20.912
Oh, uh, presentation.
Yeah. I've got it.

06:20.913 --> 06:23.148
And by the way,
you can call me Marshall.

06:23.149 --> 06:25.947
Everybody calls me...
Whatever.

06:27.887 --> 06:29.888
Um, okay.

06:29.889 --> 06:31.890
Uh, take a look right here.

06:31.891 --> 06:34.519
Now, these drawings are
amazing.

06:34.594 --> 06:36.895
Like da Vinci-in-his-prime
amazing.

06:36.896 --> 06:40.388
But the what-could-he-possibly-
have-been-smoking element,

06:40.466 --> 06:42.300
well, that is right here.

06:42.301 --> 06:43.969
Take a look in the corner.

06:43.970 --> 06:46.171
You see these drawings
in the corner.

06:46.172 --> 06:49.539
Now, they look just like normal
squiggles or doodling,

06:49.609 --> 06:51.843
like you would do
while on the phone.

06:51.844 --> 06:54.904
Although he probably
wouldn't be on the phone.

06:54.981 --> 06:57.449
They didn't actually have
phones yet.

06:57.450 --> 07:01.386
But, um, they are actually
specific strands of DNA.

07:01.454 --> 07:06.153
Now, I strung them all together,
and I got a DNA fingerprint.

07:06.225 --> 07:09.888
The DNA of this man...
Proteo di Regno.

07:09.962 --> 07:13.090
A private citizen
living in Panama City.

07:13.166 --> 07:14.866
He works as an art restorer.

07:14.867 --> 07:16.902
You're saying that 500 years ago

07:16.903 --> 07:20.896
Rambaldi drew the DNA profile
of a man who's alive today?

07:21.007 --> 07:23.475
Di Regno's DNA profile
was a code key.

07:23.476 --> 07:27.207
It let us decrypt page 94
of the Rambaldi manuscript.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.280
What's on the page?

07:28.281 --> 07:31.910
Times and dates, each marking
an apocalyptic event.

07:31.984 --> 07:34.352
September 7, 1812...

07:34.353 --> 07:36.288
Napoleon's bloodiest battle
with the Russians.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.849
June 28, 1914...

07:38.925 --> 07:40.992
the assassination
of Archduke Ferdinand

07:40.993 --> 07:42.527
started World War I.

07:42.528 --> 07:45.656
August 6, 1945, Hiroshima.
The list goes on.

07:45.731 --> 07:50.225
There's a future date listed
on the page, isn't there?

07:50.303 --> 07:52.803
48 hours from now.

07:54.207 --> 07:55.640
What's the prediction?

07:55.641 --> 07:58.009
The page doesn't say.
It just gives a time.

07:58.010 --> 08:01.946
It's the equivalent of midnight
Eastern standard time.

08:02.014 --> 08:06.178
We're coordinating with local
authorities in Panama City.

08:06.252 --> 08:09.050
When you find di Regno,
you'll escort him here.

08:09.121 --> 08:12.284
Until the moment specified
by Rambaldi has come and gone,

08:12.358 --> 08:14.593
by national security directive,

08:14.594 --> 08:18.587
this operation center is under
the jurisdiction of NSA.

09:56.028 --> 09:57.762
We've talked to the neighbors.

09:57.763 --> 10:00.561
No one saw the person
who might have done this.

10:00.633 --> 10:03.693
Forensics hasn't found anything.
No prints, nothing.

10:03.803 --> 10:06.137
And you believe
this wasn't a burglary?

10:06.138 --> 10:10.040
Nothing was taken
besides his heart.

10:14.347 --> 10:16.847
Bueno.

10:26.993 --> 10:29.493
Look.

10:31.197 --> 10:33.697
Rambaldi.

10:35.701 --> 10:38.069
So why take his heart?

10:38.070 --> 10:40.570
I don't know.

11:02.428 --> 11:04.729
It looks like the fingertip
from a latex glove.

11:04.730 --> 11:05.897
Must have torn off.

11:05.898 --> 11:09.095
I was able to enhance
the partial print.

11:09.168 --> 11:12.001
There was a match.
Guy's name is Emilio Vargas.

11:12.104 --> 11:13.571
He's a freelance assassin

11:13.572 --> 11:16.072
specializing in interrogation
and wet work.

11:16.108 --> 11:19.134
Clients include Russian Mafia,
Triad, Japanese Yakuza.

11:19.245 --> 11:21.745
Any intel
on where he operates from?

11:21.781 --> 11:23.748
There is an address
in Guadalajara.

11:23.749 --> 11:25.784
Forward me everything
you've got.

11:25.785 --> 11:28.219
I have a request
concerning Agent Dixon.

11:28.220 --> 11:29.287
What is it?

11:29.288 --> 11:31.984
I know he's been through a lot.

11:32.058 --> 11:34.459
But until he's had
a psychological evaluation

11:34.460 --> 11:36.561
and is cleared
by Medical Services,

11:36.562 --> 11:39.030
I believe it's in
his best interest and ours

11:39.031 --> 11:41.032
to remove him from field duty.

11:41.033 --> 11:45.026
I've worked with Agent Dixon
for nearly a dozen years.

11:45.137 --> 11:48.129
If he feels ready, I'm going to
accord him that respect.

11:48.240 --> 11:49.240
Given his state of mind,

11:49.241 --> 11:51.801
do you think he's the person
to make that decision?

11:51.911 --> 11:53.178
Yes.

11:53.179 --> 11:55.447
Jack, he just lost his wife.

11:55.448 --> 11:57.849
With all due respect,
why are you fighting me?

11:57.850 --> 12:02.014
I'm not required to justify my
decisions to you, Agent Vaughn.

12:02.088 --> 12:05.319
However, I recruited Dixon
into SD-6.

12:05.391 --> 12:09.054
I'm the man who sold him the lie
he was working for the CIA.

12:09.128 --> 12:11.596
I introduced him to the man
who killed his wife.

12:11.597 --> 12:13.264
I will not be the one
to tell him

12:13.265 --> 12:16.359
he can't assist
in Sloane's capture.

12:28.781 --> 12:31.082
Is everything okay?

12:31.083 --> 12:33.583
Ms. Bowman?

12:46.465 --> 12:48.965
Hey.
Excuse me. I...

12:51.003 --> 12:52.337
Thank you.

12:52.338 --> 12:53.505
No problem.

12:53.506 --> 12:55.173
Is everything all right?

12:55.174 --> 12:58.803
It's Joni Mitchell.

12:59.879 --> 13:01.312
Don't tell anyone, okay?

13:01.313 --> 13:03.813
No, I...

13:09.889 --> 13:12.858
I shouldn't bring her to work.
It makes me fatalistic.

13:12.925 --> 13:15.655
This work we're doing,
it doesn't really help.

13:15.728 --> 13:18.228
Yeah. No kidding.

13:19.265 --> 13:21.533
You know,
researching this prophecy,

13:21.534 --> 13:25.197
trying to predict what disasters
are gonna hit 36 hours from now,

13:25.304 --> 13:27.804
it makes me want to throw up.

13:35.714 --> 13:38.183
Do you believe in this stuff?

13:38.184 --> 13:40.846
Rambaldi, his prophecy?

13:40.920 --> 13:44.913
Um, I was raised, more or less,
by agnostic parents.

13:44.990 --> 13:47.025
They were
inordinately empirical,

13:47.026 --> 13:49.027
logical to the point
of foolishness.

13:49.028 --> 13:52.020
"Marshall, wear your sweater.
It's 52 degrees outside. "

13:52.097 --> 13:54.032
But I'm like,
"Mom, I'm not cold. "

13:54.033 --> 13:57.264
"Well, in this family,
we wear sweaters at 52 degrees. "

13:57.336 --> 14:00.772
I mean, there were really
no prophecies growing up

14:00.873 --> 14:03.899
or even Santa Claus,
tooth fairy.

14:04.009 --> 14:06.509
So the short answer is no.

14:06.545 --> 14:09.045
Well, that's what I keep
telling myself.

14:09.114 --> 14:12.242
To tell you the truth,
I'm exhausted by the world.

14:12.318 --> 14:13.484
Everything.

14:13.485 --> 14:17.046
The evil and the rage
and the darkness.

14:17.122 --> 14:20.319
And the last thing I need
is some 15th-century dork

14:20.392 --> 14:22.827
telling me I got
a day and a half to live.

14:22.828 --> 14:24.929
I mean, I have
so much left to do.

14:24.930 --> 14:27.430
Right.

14:31.303 --> 14:33.638
Are you gay?

14:33.639 --> 14:36.040
Why? Is there someone
you want to set me up with?

14:36.041 --> 14:39.272
No, it's just every cute guy
that I meet

14:39.345 --> 14:40.745
turns out to be gay.

14:40.746 --> 14:42.747
And I'm not stupid.
I'm in Mensa.

14:42.748 --> 14:43.982
Hold on. Not gay.

14:43.983 --> 14:47.419
I mean, I like men in
a kind of manly, friend sort...

14:47.486 --> 14:48.753
How about sushi?

14:48.754 --> 14:54.420
I mean, because when we're done
with this job, after 36 hours,

14:54.493 --> 14:57.326
of course, assuming we're
still here, we could...

14:57.396 --> 15:00.024
You want to get some sushi?

15:00.099 --> 15:01.900
Yeah.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.768
I would love that.

15:03.769 --> 15:06.294
Oh, and Joni Mitchell...

15:18.350 --> 15:21.547
Uh, Dr. Barnett?
This is Michael Vaughn.

15:21.620 --> 15:24.120
There's something I need to
talk to you about.

15:31.130 --> 15:33.131
# Vamos queriendo mas y mas #

15:33.132 --> 15:35.600
# Vamos queriendo mas y mas #

15:35.601 --> 15:37.669
# Vamos queriendo mas y mas #

15:37.670 --> 15:39.837
# Mas y mas, mas y mas #

15:39.838 --> 15:42.040
# Vamos queriendo mas y mas #

15:42.041 --> 15:44.541
# Vamos queriendo mas y mas #

15:44.610 --> 15:46.945
# Vamos queriendo mas y mas #

15:46.946 --> 15:50.643
# Mas y mas, mas y mas,
mas y mas #

16:37.196 --> 16:41.326
Mr. Vargas, we come referred
by Gurneyev.

16:41.400 --> 16:44.892
He was very pleased with the
work you did for him in Gdansk.

16:46.038 --> 16:49.337
Si.
The Copertley job.

16:49.408 --> 16:50.641
No.

16:50.642 --> 16:53.142
Janazik.

17:00.986 --> 17:04.285
Janazik was
a learning experience.

17:04.356 --> 17:06.983
I found if you remove
the eye slowly,

17:07.059 --> 17:09.789
you could keep it connected
to the optic nerve.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.887
He saw himself
in a whole new light.

17:14.133 --> 17:16.693
- Why did you kill di Regno?
- Son of a bitch!

18:03.515 --> 18:06.382
Why di Regno?
Why'd you kill him?

18:06.452 --> 18:08.853
Why'd you take his heart?

18:08.854 --> 18:11.516
- Talk, you son of a bitch.
- Aah!

18:11.590 --> 18:12.657
Aah!

18:12.658 --> 18:15.320
It wasn't his heart!
It wasn't his heart!

18:15.394 --> 18:16.727
It was a machine!

18:16.728 --> 18:18.362
I don't know!

18:18.363 --> 18:19.931
Where is it?

18:19.932 --> 18:21.866
Aah! On a truck!

18:21.867 --> 18:23.334
On its way to Colombia!

18:23.335 --> 18:24.535
Cartagena.

18:24.536 --> 18:27.036
Oh, God!

18:27.639 --> 18:29.140
Is that where Sloane is?

18:29.141 --> 18:30.641
Who?

18:30.642 --> 18:33.044
Is that where Sloane is?

18:33.045 --> 18:35.246
Who?

18:35.247 --> 18:37.148
Sloane! Where is he?

18:37.149 --> 18:38.850
I don't know Sloane!

18:38.851 --> 18:40.685
The guy who hired you!

18:40.686 --> 18:42.820
I was hired by phone!

18:42.821 --> 18:44.722
How?
How'd he pay you?

18:44.723 --> 18:47.453
Wire. Wire transfer.

18:47.526 --> 18:49.794
Tell me how...

18:49.795 --> 18:52.355
- to find... Sloane!
- Dixon!

18:52.431 --> 18:54.931
Dixon!

19:08.313 --> 19:10.348
I asked you to come in

19:10.349 --> 19:13.409
because I wanted to know
how you were doing

19:13.485 --> 19:17.251
during what has to be
a most difficult time.

19:18.090 --> 19:21.582
I am so sorry for your loss.

19:24.563 --> 19:26.063
Thank you.

19:26.064 --> 19:27.665
Do you mind if we talk

19:27.666 --> 19:30.166
about the operation yesterday
in Guadalajara?

19:30.169 --> 19:32.470
No. Of course not.

19:32.471 --> 19:36.908
This was four days
after the death of your wife.

19:36.975 --> 19:39.475
That's correct.

19:40.112 --> 19:42.180
Were you ordered
on this mission?

19:42.181 --> 19:43.948
No.

19:43.949 --> 19:47.407
I was encouraged not to go.
I insisted.

19:47.486 --> 19:48.886
Why?

19:48.887 --> 19:52.550
Because I have
unfinished business.

19:52.624 --> 19:55.124
With Sloane.

19:56.094 --> 19:59.063
It says here that you
and Agent Bristow

19:59.131 --> 20:01.332
interrogated an associate
of Sloane's.

20:01.333 --> 20:02.667
That's right.

20:02.668 --> 20:05.398
Was that difficult...

20:05.504 --> 20:08.496
being in the same room
with someone who might know

20:08.607 --> 20:12.543
the whereabouts of the man
who killed your wife?

20:13.445 --> 20:15.246
He didn't know.

20:15.247 --> 20:17.747
Did you ask him?

20:22.354 --> 20:24.854
Did Agent Bristow talk to you?

20:24.890 --> 20:27.358
Would she tell me
something different?

20:27.359 --> 20:30.328
I used necessary force.

20:30.395 --> 20:33.091
There are people at this agency

20:33.165 --> 20:35.665
who are working to bring Sloane
to justice.

20:35.734 --> 20:38.234
Not good enough.

20:38.303 --> 20:40.071
I need to be involved.

20:40.072 --> 20:44.168
Agent Dixon,
it is my job to determine

20:44.276 --> 20:49.373
whether at this time
you are fit for duty.

20:53.852 --> 20:56.650
Well, I reviewed
his medical records,

20:56.722 --> 20:58.723
and di Regno never had
a heart transplant,

20:58.724 --> 21:00.691
nor did he have
an artificial heart.

21:00.692 --> 21:03.388
Which leads us
to at least two questions.

21:03.462 --> 21:05.663
What was keeping him alive,

21:05.664 --> 21:07.965
and why did Sloane want it
so badly?

21:07.966 --> 21:10.560
Oh, there's more.

21:10.636 --> 21:12.637
Now, remember
those heart drawings?

21:12.638 --> 21:14.438
Well, I interpreted the text.

21:14.439 --> 21:17.067
Rambaldi refers to conquering
tissue degeneration.

21:17.175 --> 21:19.675
We know Rambaldi was fascinated
with immortality.

21:19.678 --> 21:23.114
Even so, what does all this
have to do with the prophecy?

21:26.718 --> 21:29.153
23 hours left.

21:29.154 --> 21:30.988
The satellites are tracking
the truck.

21:30.989 --> 21:33.890
We should get something soon.

21:33.959 --> 21:37.292
Actually, this probably has
no connection at all,

21:37.362 --> 21:39.797
but di Regno worked
as an art restorer.

21:39.798 --> 21:43.359
Carrie reminded me.
Hitler was a painter.

21:43.435 --> 21:45.002
Carrie.

21:45.003 --> 21:46.337
What?

21:46.338 --> 21:49.364
Oh, did I...
Um, Ms. Bowman.

21:51.009 --> 21:53.509
I should go.

21:57.849 --> 22:02.309
Syd, did you tell Barnett that
I wasn't fit for field duty?

22:02.387 --> 22:03.654
Dixon, no.

22:03.655 --> 22:06.647
You didn't put in a request
for me to undergo an eval?

22:06.725 --> 22:09.225
I promise you, no.

22:13.265 --> 22:15.099
Somebody did.

22:15.100 --> 22:18.797
I've been ordered to report
for a drug test.

22:22.074 --> 22:24.574
You're worried.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.845
I've been taking Vicodin.

22:28.914 --> 22:31.382
Now, I stopped.
I threw them away.

22:31.383 --> 22:34.045
It doesn't matter.
It'll show up on the test.

22:35.253 --> 22:39.622
Sydney, they're going to
suspend me.

22:43.428 --> 22:46.591
They've I.D.'d the truck.
It just crossed the border.

22:46.665 --> 22:49.395
Your father's developing an op
to intercept di Regno's heart.

22:49.468 --> 22:52.301
Did you report to Barnett
that Dixon was taking pills?

22:52.404 --> 22:54.904
Yes.

22:55.574 --> 22:58.074
Come here.

23:02.848 --> 23:04.749
You should have called me first.

23:04.750 --> 23:07.250
Well, I'm sorry, but I
don't need your permission.

23:07.252 --> 23:09.320
Why go out of your way
to make things harder?

23:09.321 --> 23:11.322
I'm trying to protect him
and you.

23:11.323 --> 23:13.883
One mistake out there
could get you killed.

23:13.959 --> 23:15.426
He nearly beat a man to death.

23:15.427 --> 23:17.952
He got us our lead
on the di Regno device.

23:18.029 --> 23:21.362
Look, I get that you both have
a stake in catching Sloane.

23:21.433 --> 23:23.300
But it can also cloud
your judgment.

23:23.301 --> 23:25.336
It makes me insane
when you patronize me.

23:25.337 --> 23:28.363
This conversation's over.
I stand by my decision.

23:52.397 --> 23:54.465
Shall we continue?

23:54.466 --> 23:57.401
I would like to cross
the north summit.

24:00.672 --> 24:03.334
You did not tell me this
when you hired me.

24:03.442 --> 24:07.378
If I had,
you wouldn't have come.

24:07.446 --> 24:11.439
I will gladly pay you
double the amount we discussed.

24:11.516 --> 24:14.016
No.

24:14.286 --> 24:18.586
People that go there
do not return the same.

24:19.825 --> 24:21.725
I see.

24:21.726 --> 24:25.787
Well, don't worry about me.

24:41.513 --> 24:44.914
I wanted to say I'm sorry.
You caught me off guard.

24:44.983 --> 24:47.483
I'm sorry.

24:47.552 --> 24:51.147
I know you're just looking out
for Dixon and me.

24:52.224 --> 24:54.258
His test came back negative.

24:54.259 --> 24:57.092
You were right.
Must have been aspirin.

24:57.162 --> 24:59.630
Are we okay?

24:59.631 --> 25:01.232
Yeah.

25:01.233 --> 25:03.733
Good.

25:12.110 --> 25:14.806
I hope I didn't wake the kids.

25:15.847 --> 25:18.748
They're at Diane's sister's.

25:20.118 --> 25:22.618
You passed the drug test.

25:24.155 --> 25:26.490
I'm in trouble, Syd.

25:26.491 --> 25:29.016
What did you do?
Switch the results?

25:30.762 --> 25:33.390
As soon as I left,
I knew it was a mistake.

25:33.465 --> 25:34.632
Oh, Dixon.

25:34.633 --> 25:38.091
But it was too late.
The results were cataloged.

25:38.203 --> 25:41.502
Sloane murdered my wife.

25:42.307 --> 25:44.832
I have to make him pay for that.

25:45.877 --> 25:48.903
I've been called in
to talk to Barnett.

25:50.415 --> 25:52.416
- You can't tell her.
- Dixon.

25:52.417 --> 25:55.352
If they find out, I'll never
work for the government again.

25:55.420 --> 25:57.254
How will I take care of my kids?

25:57.255 --> 26:02.693
Sydney, I don't know
how to do this without Diane.

26:06.932 --> 26:09.432
I have to go.

26:09.768 --> 26:12.268
Syd.

26:17.142 --> 26:19.376
Thanks for coming in so late.

26:19.377 --> 26:23.473
But I was about to finish
my evaluation on Marcus Dixon,

26:23.548 --> 26:26.048
and I didn't feel
it would be comprehensive

26:26.051 --> 26:30.545
without getting some input from
the person who knows him best.

26:30.622 --> 26:33.122
What would you like to know?

26:35.827 --> 26:38.557
Your father has argued strongly

26:38.630 --> 26:41.724
that Dixon should stay
in the field.

26:41.800 --> 26:45.668
And without any evidence
of drug use,

26:45.770 --> 26:48.270
I can't countermand him.

26:48.340 --> 26:52.902
Is there anything that you think
that I should know

26:53.011 --> 26:55.511
before I give my final decision?

27:07.292 --> 27:09.426
Marcus Dixon is one
of the strongest people

27:09.427 --> 27:11.595
I've ever known.

27:11.596 --> 27:14.565
I trust him with my life
without hesitation.

27:16.701 --> 27:17.901
And I am confident

27:17.902 --> 27:21.497
that despite the agony
he's feeling right now...

27:22.941 --> 27:25.441
...he will pull through this.

27:53.772 --> 27:55.305
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:55.306 --> 27:56.607
I got your message.

27:56.608 --> 27:59.043
The truck left
the Pan-American highway.

27:59.044 --> 28:02.207
It looks like its endpoint
is the Estrella shipyard.

28:02.280 --> 28:03.580
What about Dixon?

28:03.581 --> 28:06.948
I left word after I called you.
He hasn't called me back.

28:08.787 --> 28:10.287
This is the Estrella,

28:10.288 --> 28:12.848
a cargo-freight area
with its own security.

28:12.924 --> 28:14.291
The perimeter has patrols

28:14.292 --> 28:17.056
covering both the north
and southeast sectors.

28:17.128 --> 28:19.790
Intel indicates the truck
is located here.

28:19.864 --> 28:23.163
Sydney, you'll infiltrate
the weakest post and secure it.

28:23.234 --> 28:25.703
Vaughn and Delta Force
will then join you

28:25.704 --> 28:28.072
to determine whether or not
this "heart"

28:28.073 --> 28:30.107
is actually a weapon,
an explosive.

28:30.108 --> 28:31.875
By the time you reach the truck,

28:31.876 --> 28:35.175
you'll only have 20 minutes
until the midnight deadline.

28:35.246 --> 28:37.746
If you're unable to locate
the device,

28:37.816 --> 28:40.876
I've been given authority
to initiate secondary protocol,

28:40.952 --> 28:43.353
to rig the yard with enough C-4

28:43.354 --> 28:45.689
to destroy
whatever the device may be.

28:45.690 --> 28:47.257
- You're late.
- Sorry, sir.

28:47.258 --> 28:49.593
Fill him in on the way.

28:49.594 --> 28:52.094
You leave in an hour.

28:52.464 --> 28:54.665
Uh, could you give us a minute?

28:54.666 --> 28:56.500
Sure.

28:56.501 --> 28:59.001
- I'll see you in Tech Services.
- Okay.

29:00.305 --> 29:03.172
Thank you for not saying
anything.

29:03.241 --> 29:05.741
It wasn't just Barnett.

29:06.644 --> 29:09.144
I lied to Vaughn.

29:10.081 --> 29:11.148
Sydney.

29:11.149 --> 29:13.811
I need you to look me in the eye
and promise me

29:13.885 --> 29:16.385
that you can handle this.

29:17.455 --> 29:19.955
I promise.

29:21.993 --> 29:24.493
Okay.

29:25.096 --> 29:27.596
Let's go.

30:20.885 --> 30:23.385
Do you know who I am?

30:26.157 --> 30:28.657
Do you?

30:28.726 --> 30:30.327
Arvin Sloane.

30:30.328 --> 30:33.820
That's right,
you son of a bitch.

30:33.898 --> 30:38.858
Your search for Rambaldi
has frustrated you.

30:38.970 --> 30:40.971
Frustrated me?

30:40.972 --> 30:44.430
You mean that meaningless quest
you sent me on 30 years ago

30:44.542 --> 30:46.276
that made me abandon the CIA

30:46.277 --> 30:48.777
and betray everyone
I ever loved?

30:50.048 --> 30:52.915
Your wife has been killed.

30:57.689 --> 31:00.189
How did you know that?

31:00.625 --> 31:03.594
Put away the gun.

31:03.661 --> 31:06.687
There is something
I must show you.

31:41.266 --> 31:43.928
We found the truck.
No sign of the driver.

31:44.002 --> 31:45.535
I'm going to look
for the device.

31:45.536 --> 31:47.771
Copy, Mountaineer. Base camp,
waiting on your signal.

31:47.772 --> 31:50.207
Copy that, Boy Scout.
Hold your position.

31:50.208 --> 31:52.708
Cover me.

31:55.947 --> 31:57.814
It's not here.
It's been moved.

31:57.815 --> 32:00.340
Okay, we have to search
every container.

32:00.418 --> 32:02.519
- Initiate secondary protocol.
- Not yet.

32:02.520 --> 32:05.045
We'll give Sydney time
to find the device.

32:05.123 --> 32:07.623
At least move your team
into place.

32:07.625 --> 32:09.626
Boy Scout, weapons free.
Move out.

32:09.627 --> 32:12.127
Copy.

32:23.408 --> 32:24.775
Secure the freight?

32:24.776 --> 32:27.276
Yeah.

32:37.488 --> 32:39.456
Who the hell are you?

32:39.457 --> 32:40.290
CIA!

32:40.291 --> 32:42.693
You just took possession
of a cargo.

32:42.694 --> 32:44.194
- Where is it?
- No idea.

32:48.433 --> 32:50.933
Where is it?

32:52.470 --> 32:54.905
Maybe they didn't tell you,
but it could be

32:54.906 --> 32:57.602
- a weapon of mass destruction.
- Piss off.

32:58.943 --> 33:00.477
Okay. Okay.

33:00.478 --> 33:01.745
You see this?

33:01.746 --> 33:04.476
There's enough C-4 here
to blow us all to hell.

33:04.549 --> 33:06.650
Where the hell is the device?

33:06.651 --> 33:09.151
Dixon, what are you doing?

33:09.187 --> 33:12.213
- Stay back, Sydney!
- You're gonna kill yourself.

33:12.290 --> 33:13.657
I have nothing to lose!

33:13.658 --> 33:15.659
What the hell is your man doing?

33:15.660 --> 33:16.994
Disarm your explosive.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.729
Can you see them?

33:18.730 --> 33:21.290
- Negative.
- Dixon, think.

33:21.366 --> 33:22.632
Don't do this.

33:22.633 --> 33:25.002
- Sydney, get out!
- I'm not leaving without you.

33:25.003 --> 33:26.937
Dixon, deactivate that weapon!

33:26.938 --> 33:28.905
Tell me, or we die.

33:28.906 --> 33:30.741
Base camp, I've got a visual.

33:30.742 --> 33:33.506
- What's it gonna be?
- Tell Vaughn to take him down.

33:33.578 --> 33:35.679
Dixon might be holding
a detonator.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.581
Firing could trigger
the explosion.

33:39.017 --> 33:41.284
15... 14...

33:41.285 --> 33:43.253
Agent Bristow, I'm pulling rank.

33:43.254 --> 33:45.848
This is NSA Deputy Director
Brandon.

33:45.923 --> 33:46.923
I am ordering you.

33:46.924 --> 33:49.449
to take that shot
at first possible opportunity.

33:49.527 --> 33:52.189
Sydney, please! Go!

33:52.263 --> 33:53.597
What's it gonna be?

33:53.598 --> 33:55.432
- Tell me!
- Okay!

33:55.433 --> 33:57.667
Container 246-B.

33:57.668 --> 33:59.336
Now shut it off.

33:59.337 --> 34:02.272
Shut it off!
Shut it off!

34:13.284 --> 34:16.879
I cut the primer cord.
I'm not that desperate.

34:21.426 --> 34:23.159
We've got a device.

34:23.161 --> 34:26.527
2 minutes,
40 seconds to midnight.

34:56.194 --> 35:00.824
30 years ago,
I could only tell you so much.

35:00.898 --> 35:06.962
Information had to come
to you over time

35:07.071 --> 35:09.571
or you would not have
understood.

35:10.641 --> 35:15.305
Certain events needed to unfold,

35:15.379 --> 35:19.509
according to
Rambaldi's writings.

35:22.487 --> 35:26.753
Your wife's death,
though unfortunate,

35:26.824 --> 35:30.783
was a necessary step
on your journey.

35:30.862 --> 35:35.356
You knew my wife
was going to die,

35:35.433 --> 35:37.933
and you didn't warn me.

35:41.272 --> 35:47.177
If I had, I could not have
given you this.

35:51.983 --> 35:53.650
No sign of radioactivity.

35:53.651 --> 35:57.849
The device is self-contained.
Not hard-wired to the case.

35:57.922 --> 35:59.923
Do I have authorization
to open it?

35:59.924 --> 36:01.158
19 seconds.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.659
Open the box, Delta leader.

36:04.362 --> 36:07.763
You can always choose
to ignore it.

36:08.933 --> 36:11.168
I've opened the box.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.802
Can you deactivate it?

36:12.803 --> 36:14.971
Negative.

36:14.972 --> 36:16.473
It's not a bomb.

36:16.474 --> 36:18.508
- What is it?
- Don't answer that.

36:18.509 --> 36:21.009
You seal the box, bring it home.

36:34.358 --> 36:35.892
Sir, it's Delta leader.

36:35.893 --> 36:38.261
It's all clear.
We're packing up.

36:38.262 --> 36:39.763
Oh.

36:39.764 --> 36:42.264
I guess Rambaldi was wrong.

36:43.434 --> 36:46.528
Your jurisdiction just expired.

36:46.637 --> 36:49.970
I'll have a jet standing by
to take you back to Washington.

36:53.444 --> 36:56.174
Now you understand.

36:56.247 --> 36:59.410
Your journey has just begun.

37:22.440 --> 37:26.934
Last night,
asking you to lie for me...

37:27.912 --> 37:30.881
I'm sorry I ever put you
in that position.

37:33.618 --> 37:36.118
It's okay.

37:41.225 --> 37:43.725
After you left...

37:44.996 --> 37:49.763
...I got in my car,
drove to this bridge I know.

37:50.868 --> 37:54.360
I was standing there,
looking up at the sky,

37:54.472 --> 37:59.341
asking God for forgiveness
for what I was about to do.

38:02.146 --> 38:04.646
And then I heard something.

38:05.316 --> 38:07.816
It was a baby crying.

38:09.920 --> 38:11.388
It was a baby crying.

38:11.389 --> 38:13.657
I didn't know
where it was coming from.

38:13.658 --> 38:16.158
I was alone.

38:16.794 --> 38:19.820
And I started thinking
about my babies.

38:21.332 --> 38:23.166
I could see them.

38:23.167 --> 38:26.159
I saw them in the crib.

38:26.237 --> 38:29.866
I saw us sitting up with them
at night when they were sick.

38:33.010 --> 38:36.810
And so I stepped down
off the railing.

38:38.282 --> 38:40.283
And I looked up,

38:40.284 --> 38:43.344
and it wasn't a baby
that was crying.

38:45.189 --> 38:50.422
It was just a tree branch,
bending in the wind.

38:55.866 --> 38:58.460
# You're all I need
to get by #

38:58.536 --> 39:01.061
# You're all I need
to get by #

39:01.172 --> 39:02.339
# As long as I got you
then, baby #

39:02.340 --> 39:06.743
# You know that you got me,
oh, oh #

39:06.811 --> 39:09.311
Can I have a bite?

39:17.388 --> 39:20.585
Dixon's going to be okay.
He admitted what he did.

39:20.658 --> 39:23.821
He turned himself in.
That matters to Personnel.

39:31.635 --> 39:34.570
Vaughn, I knew what he did.

39:35.906 --> 39:38.431
I knew that he changed
his results.

39:39.977 --> 39:43.140
And I didn't say anything
to Barnett.

39:43.948 --> 39:46.448
Or you.

39:51.155 --> 39:54.124
You know this,

39:54.191 --> 39:57.092
but my parents were absent
when I was growing up.

39:57.161 --> 39:59.755
I never had anyone
to disappoint.

40:01.866 --> 40:04.366
That's different now.

40:05.903 --> 40:07.404
I'm sorry.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.539
# You're all #

40:09.540 --> 40:12.998
# You're all I need #

40:13.110 --> 40:14.944
# You're all #

40:14.945 --> 40:18.540
# You're all I need #

40:18.616 --> 40:20.683
# You're all #

40:20.684 --> 40:23.847
# You're all I need #

40:23.921 --> 40:25.889
# You're all #

40:25.890 --> 40:29.519
# You're all I need #

40:29.593 --> 40:31.194
# You're all #

40:31.195 --> 40:37.794
# You're all I need, baby,
baby, to get by #

40:37.868 --> 40:40.236
# Yeah #

40:40.237 --> 40:42.737
# Get by #

40:43.305 --> 40:49.180
