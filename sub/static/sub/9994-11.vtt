00:20.520 --> 00:21.560
Oh, thank God.

00:22.120 --> 00:23.000
Right here!

00:23.400 --> 00:24.240
It's this way.

00:24.800 --> 00:26.160
He's in
the living room.

00:26.560 --> 00:27.800
(sobbing):
It's my husband.

00:27.880 --> 00:28.960
He just collapsed.

00:28.960 --> 00:30.000
And I can't feel him
breathing.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.240
Ma'am, I need you
to step away.

00:31.520 --> 00:32.400
Ma'am, I need
you to step away.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.360
Ma'am, I need you
to step away.

00:33.360 --> 00:35.360
Please help him.
We will do the best
we can.

00:40.080 --> 00:41.120
Not a sound.

00:43.440 --> 00:44.400
Don't move.

GLEASON:
 <i>And the Department</i>
 <i>of Public Safety</i>

01:30.400 --> 01:32.920
wants us to find two days
we can set aside

01:32.920 --> 01:34.160
so they can send
a fellow down here

01:34.160 --> 01:36.440
to teach us all this new
barcode system they've got

01:36.440 --> 01:38.000
for arrest paperwork

01:38.280 --> 01:40.760
for cross-jurisdictional
and inter-departmental cases.

01:41.160 --> 01:42.320
Two days?

01:42.520 --> 01:43.560
For barcodes?

01:46.440 --> 01:48.920
A most unusual story out
of the Southwest today...

01:49.040 --> 01:51.520
after making what city
dispatchers assumed would be

01:51.520 --> 01:52.280
a routine call to a house...

01:52.280 --> 01:53.720
Sir, they're waiting for me
to call them back

01:53.720 --> 01:56.200
...in the eastern suburbs
of Phoenix, Arizona.
with those dates.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.960
Two Emergency Medical
Technicians

01:57.960 --> 02:00.320
and their vehicle appear
to have vanished.

02:00.320 --> 02:01.760
The District Attorney of Phoenix

02:01.760 --> 02:02.840
had this to say.

02:02.920 --> 02:05.120
I'd like to emphasize
that while we are vigorously

02:05.120 --> 02:07.720
investigating the disappearance
of these men and their vehicle,

02:07.720 --> 02:10.199
at the present time
there is no definitive proof

02:10.199 --> 02:12.440
that they've actually met
with foul play.

02:12.440 --> 02:13.760
That having been said...

02:13.760 --> 02:15.320
Do you remember that lady?

02:16.160 --> 02:18.080
Said she dreamt things?

02:20.000 --> 02:21.040
From Phoenix.

02:23.560 --> 02:24.800
You get me her number.

02:24.880 --> 02:39.280
<font color="#ffff00">Capture:FRM@ÇòÇò  
  sync:FRM@¹Ûº£ÎÀ</font>

03:13.320 --> 03:14.840
You are so mean.

03:19.280 --> 03:22.160
Ariel, could you please
eat a little faster?

03:22.160 --> 03:23.280
What are you talking about?

03:23.280 --> 03:24.640
I'm eating
as fast as I can.

03:24.920 --> 03:26.000
Mom!

03:26.000 --> 03:26.840
Bridgette.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.960
There's no need to shout,
I'm right here.

03:29.920 --> 03:31.160
Make Ariel
eat faster.

03:31.160 --> 03:32.400
Ariel, eat faster.

03:32.680 --> 03:33.840
But, Mom, you're the one
who told me

03:33.840 --> 03:35.480
that eating slow is good
for my digestion.

03:35.680 --> 03:36.520
This is true.

03:36.720 --> 03:38.080
This has nothing
to do with 'gestion!

03:38.080 --> 03:41.240
This has to do with me
wanting to get to school

03:41.240 --> 03:42.560
and Ariel trying
to make us late!

03:42.560 --> 03:43.440
We're not gonna be late.

03:43.440 --> 03:45.160
We are gonna leave
when we need to leave,

03:45.160 --> 03:47.760
whether Ariel is
finished or not.

03:48.040 --> 03:49.000
Are my ears
deceiving me,

03:49.000 --> 03:50.920
or is our middle child
actually in a hurry

03:50.920 --> 03:52.160
to get to school today?

03:52.560 --> 03:54.080
We're having a special
assembly today.

03:54.080 --> 03:55.320
And I don't want
to miss it.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.040
And you're not
gonna miss it.

03:57.040 --> 03:58.680
It's "Drug Awareness Day".

03:58.680 --> 04:00.400
"Officer Bill" is
coming to school

04:00.400 --> 04:01.960
to talk to the
kids about drugs.

04:01.960 --> 04:03.480
Officer Bill, huh?

04:04.040 --> 04:05.120
Mm, the "drug assembly".

04:05.120 --> 04:06.440
Another rite of passe.

04:07.120 --> 04:08.840
DEVALOS:
 <i>The ambulance answered</i>
 <i>a dispatch call</i>

04:08.840 --> 04:12.680
from 29139 Alma Doarada Court.

04:12.880 --> 04:15.000
The call came
from a prepaid cell phone.

04:15.000 --> 04:15.960
We now know the house

04:15.960 --> 04:17.480
they were called to
has been on the market

04:17.480 --> 04:19.120
unoccupied for five months.

04:20.279 --> 04:21.320
So it was a set-up.

04:21.399 --> 04:22.560
Certainly appears
that way.

04:22.680 --> 04:25.040
But why would anyone want
to car-jack an ambulance?

04:25.920 --> 04:27.440
Drugs, maybe
the equipment.

04:28.040 --> 04:29.080
Could be it was personal.

04:30.160 --> 04:32.720
We have officers
interviewing the families of the two EMTs.

04:32.840 --> 04:33.960
Reviewing their records.

04:34.440 --> 04:35.600
Maybe someone
had a beef.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.080
Allison Dubois.

04:39.360 --> 04:41.440
Well that's pretty damn
serendipitous...

04:41.440 --> 04:44.040
seeing as how she's exactly
who I'm looking for.

04:44.440 --> 04:47.520
Is this Captain Kenneth Push
of the Texas Rangers?

04:47.880 --> 04:50.480
Well, talk about your
serendipity working overtime.

04:50.840 --> 04:52.880
To what do I owe this pleasure?

04:53.160 --> 04:55.480
Well I'm calling
kind of unofficially

04:55.480 --> 04:57.080
on official business.

04:57.760 --> 04:59.400
All right, I'm listening
unofficially

04:59.400 --> 05:00.840
with both ears wide open.

05:01.400 --> 05:03.720
I think I might've come
into some information regarding

05:03.720 --> 05:06.600
those missing
Emergency Medical fellas

05:06.600 --> 05:07.720
that have been on the news.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.720
I'm holding a man here...

05:11.000 --> 05:13.600
and I can't discuss it,
and neither can you.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.320
He has ties to Arizona.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.760
Are you familiar
with Desolation Trail,

05:18.760 --> 05:22.400
to the junction of Route 65,
just east of Phoenix?

05:23.160 --> 05:23.760
Yeah.

05:24.440 --> 05:26.720
I think you might want
to have a look around there.

05:27.400 --> 05:28.080
Will do.

05:28.080 --> 05:29.040
What do I tell people?

05:29.040 --> 05:30.280
How did I hear about this?

05:32.880 --> 05:33.840
I don't know.

05:36.400 --> 05:37.760
Tell 'em you dreamt it.

05:48.400 --> 05:49.640
Okay, it's official.

05:49.640 --> 05:50.880
Your sister's asleep.

05:50.880 --> 05:53.080
Your mommy's already
kissed you good night.

05:53.200 --> 05:54.440
It's after 8:30.

05:54.440 --> 05:57.120
Now what's this nonsense
about "I'm waiting for Daddy"?

05:57.520 --> 06:00.080
Mommy told you that
I was gonna work late.

06:00.200 --> 06:02.680
I know, but I really wanted
my kiss,

06:02.960 --> 06:04.800
and I have some really
important news.

06:04.800 --> 06:06.320
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

06:06.320 --> 06:07.280
You'll wake your sister.

06:08.040 --> 06:08.840
All right.

06:10.760 --> 06:11.720
There's your kiss.

06:11.720 --> 06:12.960
Now, can this stuff wait
'til tomorrow?

06:12.960 --> 06:14.200
'Cause Daddy's really tired.

06:17.280 --> 06:18.800
Okay, what's this stuff?

06:19.000 --> 06:23.880
Did you know that there's over
150 street names for heroin?

06:24.640 --> 06:26.840
That's what you wanted
to tell me?

06:27.520 --> 06:28.480
Okay.

06:28.760 --> 06:29.560
Great.

06:29.640 --> 06:30.800
A hundred and fifty.

06:31.480 --> 06:33.000
Got it. Let's get some rest.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.120
They call it "H,"
"big daddy,"

06:35.200 --> 06:37.880
"reindeer dust"
and even "Bart Simpson".

06:38.280 --> 06:39.120
Excellent.

06:39.600 --> 06:40.360
Now we know.

06:40.760 --> 06:42.280
Wanna hear the names
for PCP?

06:42.960 --> 06:44.200
Uh, no, that's okay.

06:44.400 --> 06:45.280
How 'bout marijuana?

06:45.280 --> 06:47.400
Hey, Bridge...
"Mary Jane"...

06:47.680 --> 06:50.360
"Panama Gold"
and there's "Spliff."

06:50.560 --> 06:51.800
"Spliff", huh?

06:52.280 --> 06:54.000
Hmm, yeah, I heard that one.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.800
You have? Where'd you hear it?

06:57.360 --> 06:59.640
Probably when I was
in drug assembly, years ago.

06:59.840 --> 07:01.560
You had drug assembly?

07:01.560 --> 07:02.440
Oh, yes.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.040
So you learned
all about drugs.

07:05.040 --> 07:05.600
Oh, yes.

07:05.600 --> 07:08.560
So... you would never use them.

07:08.760 --> 07:10.000
Oh, yes, oh, no.

07:10.200 --> 07:10.880
Not ever.

07:10.880 --> 07:12.040
Not ever?
No.

07:12.040 --> 07:12.880
Not ever.

07:15.560 --> 07:16.360
Okay.

07:17.480 --> 07:18.080
Great.

07:18.080 --> 07:20.560
We're both drug free and ready
for a good night's sleep.

07:21.600 --> 07:22.960
Don't let the
bed bugs bite.

07:22.960 --> 07:23.840
I won't.

07:28.320 --> 07:29.200
(whispering):
Wait, wait.

07:29.480 --> 07:30.920
The ambulance drivers?

07:31.600 --> 07:32.840
They found them?
They were there?

07:32.840 --> 07:34.280
Oh, yeah, we found 'em.

07:34.280 --> 07:35.920
What's left of them anyway.

07:36.480 --> 07:38.320
At the bottom of
a 300-foot drop.

07:39.280 --> 07:40.600
I'll call you when I know more.

07:41.360 --> 07:42.160
Thank you.

07:46.640 --> 07:47.520
Are you gonna fill me in?

07:47.520 --> 07:49.320
Or am I gonna have to read
about it in the paper?

07:50.400 --> 07:51.840
They found those EMTs.

07:52.320 --> 07:53.160
Both dead.

07:53.160 --> 07:54.800
Both... murdered.
(sighs)

07:55.760 --> 07:56.720
That's terrible.

07:57.200 --> 07:58.160
It's horrible.

07:59.600 --> 08:00.280
But?

08:01.600 --> 08:04.400
But...
and it's not a big thing.

08:05.560 --> 08:07.760
I told them that I knew
where they were.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.000
That I had a dream.

08:09.840 --> 08:10.320
Okay.

08:10.320 --> 08:11.960
But I didn't really
have a dream.

08:12.240 --> 08:14.840
Captain Push called me
this morning from Texas.

08:15.240 --> 08:16.680
He told me where they were.

08:17.800 --> 08:20.320
I guess I just feel
kinda funny about lying

08:21.080 --> 08:23.280
and getting credit,
all of that.

08:23.840 --> 08:24.800
Boy, I gotta tell you.

08:24.800 --> 08:25.960
On the scale
of white lies...

08:25.960 --> 08:27.800
that's got to be
about the whitest.

08:28.360 --> 08:31.360
And who cares where
the clue came from?

08:31.800 --> 08:34.039
I mean, the important thing
is that we now know

08:34.039 --> 08:35.360
that these guys
were murdered.

08:36.520 --> 08:37.400
Which means you
and your friends

08:37.400 --> 08:38.360
can get on
with the business

08:38.360 --> 08:40.240
of trying to figure out
who did it and why.

08:41.320 --> 08:42.280
Who you calling now?

08:42.360 --> 08:43.120
Captain Push.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.240
I wanna let him know
and thank him.

08:45.240 --> 08:46.960
Allison, it's almost 10:00.

08:47.080 --> 08:48.800
It's almost 11:00 in Texas.

08:49.280 --> 08:51.080
Don't you think it'll hold
'til morning?

08:54.080 --> 08:55.600
That's an excellent
choice.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.960
Now just turn off that light
and warm up that bed.

08:59.240 --> 09:02.040
'Cause Daddy's tired and he's
got some serious sleeping to do.

09:26.280 --> 09:27.160
This way.

09:44.240 --> 09:45.080
SECURITY GUARD:
Don't move.

09:49.800 --> 09:50.560
What are you doing?

09:50.840 --> 09:52.200
What does it look
like I'm doing?

10:08.880 --> 10:09.640
Push here.

10:09.840 --> 10:10.880
Hey, it's Allison.

10:10.880 --> 10:12.040
Did I wake you?

10:12.240 --> 10:13.880
I, I have some good news.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.880
I, I mean, it's horrible news,

10:15.880 --> 10:17.520
but I thought you'd want
to know.

10:17.680 --> 10:18.480
Okay.

10:19.240 --> 10:21.240
Well, we found those EMTs.

10:21.520 --> 10:23.280
They were
right where you said they'd be.

10:24.200 --> 10:25.160
They'd been murdered.

10:25.480 --> 10:26.720
Ambushed and murdered.

10:27.480 --> 10:28.360
Anyway...

10:29.680 --> 10:31.040
I wanted to thank you.

10:32.560 --> 10:33.600
Don't thank me.

10:34.560 --> 10:35.640
I didn't do anything.

10:36.480 --> 10:37.440
You okay?

10:38.800 --> 10:40.240
Me?

10:40.240 --> 10:41.280
Never better.

10:41.960 --> 10:44.160
Oops, I've been
caught on the phone

10:44.160 --> 10:45.800
with a strange man
by my husband,

10:45.800 --> 10:47.800
so I'll have to take
you at your word.

10:48.200 --> 10:52.240
Well, tell, uh, your husband
the strange man says "hey."

10:53.000 --> 10:53.760
Will do.

10:55.120 --> 10:56.840
JOE:
I need you girls ready
in five minutes.

10:57.200 --> 10:59.040
Mommy's got a
dentist appointment.

10:59.040 --> 10:59.600
I got sticky hands.
I know.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.720
So I'm taking you
to school today.

11:02.280 --> 11:03.720
Daddy can't be
late for work.

11:04.480 --> 11:05.760
Has anyone seen
Bridgette?

11:06.800 --> 11:07.760
Bridge!

11:12.920 --> 11:15.240
Bridgette,
what are you looking for?

11:17.840 --> 11:19.640
Hey, everybody,
what's the big occasion?

11:19.920 --> 11:20.720
I don't know,
it looks--

11:20.720 --> 11:22.640
I think maybe Bridge was just
going through my drawers.

11:23.400 --> 11:24.920
It looked like maybe she
was looking for something.

11:25.400 --> 11:26.280
Is that true,
honey?

11:26.280 --> 11:27.880
Were you looking
for something?

11:27.880 --> 11:29.520
Do you need
something?
N-No.

11:30.960 --> 11:31.840
I don't know.

11:35.680 --> 11:36.160
Well, you know what?

11:36.160 --> 11:37.120
Whatever it is is gonna have

11:37.120 --> 11:38.160
to wait until tonight,

11:38.160 --> 11:39.880
um, 'cause I got work and the kids have school.

11:39.880 --> 11:41.120
Bridge, I need you in the car.

11:43.040 --> 11:44.960
I swear I have no idea
what that was about.

11:46.040 --> 11:47.080
Good luck at the dentist.

11:47.760 --> 11:48.720
Don't remind me.

11:52.720 --> 11:54.760
Whoever you are,
I can't do this right now.

11:54.840 --> 11:55.600
I'm late.

11:56.200 --> 11:57.160
I'm l-late. Ow!

11:57.160 --> 11:58.320
Late, late, late.

12:01.960 --> 12:03.280
Captain Push.

12:05.400 --> 12:06.920
You want to hear a story?

12:07.800 --> 12:09.720
You dreamt it?

12:10.480 --> 12:11.640
For months now.

12:13.440 --> 12:15.080
Little bits at first.

12:16.800 --> 12:18.160
The ambulance light,

12:19.480 --> 12:21.240
the wood floor
of the living room.

12:22.080 --> 12:23.320
Then bigger pieces.

12:23.440 --> 12:25.640
The ambulance being called
to the scene,

12:25.920 --> 12:28.320
what happens
in the house.

12:30.160 --> 12:33.200
It didn't all come together
in one event till a couple weeks ago.

12:34.640 --> 12:36.000
Didn't know
what to make of it

12:36.000 --> 12:39.080
till I saw your boss
on the TV yesterday afternoon.

12:42.040 --> 12:44.160
I thought I was going crazy.

12:45.480 --> 12:46.720
Might go yet.

12:48.840 --> 12:50.360
That's why I flew
all this way.

12:51.720 --> 12:54.600
That's why I showed up
like I did.

12:58.520 --> 12:59.880
That and, uh...

13:00.840 --> 13:02.000
...one more thing.

13:02.960 --> 13:04.960
I saw the people
who did this.

13:07.440 --> 13:09.080
I know what they look like.

13:11.080 --> 13:12.920
I cannot walk into a room

13:12.920 --> 13:15.120
full of other
police professionals

13:16.000 --> 13:19.320
and offer my help based on
the fact that I've had a dream.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.560
But you did have a dream.

13:21.920 --> 13:23.760
You were in a coma for months.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.840
I have to believe something
could happen to your brain

13:26.840 --> 13:27.880
if you're gone that long.

13:27.880 --> 13:29.120
I'm not an expert, but...

13:29.120 --> 13:30.360
It's gotta be you.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.080
When we're in that room
looking at those pictures,it's gotta be you.

13:35.240 --> 13:36.320
You had the dream.

13:36.520 --> 13:37.640
You're looking for the faces.

13:40.440 --> 13:41.960
Speaking of which,

13:43.200 --> 13:45.600
when was the last time you
saw your cardiologist?

13:45.920 --> 13:47.920
Oh, cardio...

13:48.680 --> 13:51.280
Okay, I'm gonna call
Phoenix General.

13:51.280 --> 13:54.040
I'm sure your old friends will
be thrilled to see you again.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.400
Everybody who's anybody
in Phoenix crime.

13:57.400 --> 13:59.160
Black males back
to about '97.

13:59.160 --> 14:01.360
Also, white women
back to the mid '90s.

14:02.600 --> 14:04.520
Also got the crime scene
photos in this folder

14:04.520 --> 14:06.040
in case you need
a mory jogger.

14:07.200 --> 14:08.520
Can I buy you a cup
of coffee, Captain?

14:09.800 --> 14:12.360
I promised Ms. Dubois here
I'd keep her company.

14:12.680 --> 14:13.800
Take a rain check, though.

14:13.800 --> 14:14.680
All right.

14:26.360 --> 14:28.280
Sorry to have wasted
your time, Allison.

14:29.720 --> 14:32.040
I saw it so clearly
in my mind.

14:32.240 --> 14:33.080
No.

14:34.160 --> 14:36.240
No need to apologize.

14:36.640 --> 14:38.760
I shouldn't have to tell
you all this means is

14:38.760 --> 14:41.440
that our killers haven't
committed any crimes

14:42.200 --> 14:43.440
in the Phoenix area.

14:43.920 --> 14:44.880
We'll find them.

14:48.320 --> 14:49.960
I guess this is the house.

14:50.840 --> 14:51.520
Yeah.

14:54.880 --> 14:56.200
And who's this?

14:56.880 --> 15:00.600
That's one of the EMTs
who was murdered.

15:06.560 --> 15:07.720
There's something wro...

15:10.480 --> 15:12.200
Are you telling me
these are the two people

15:12.200 --> 15:13.640
you pulled out of that ravine?

15:14.440 --> 15:15.080
Yeah.

15:15.560 --> 15:17.120
I saw two white men.

15:18.360 --> 15:20.760
In my dream,
they were both white men.

15:21.040 --> 15:22.000
Okay.

15:23.640 --> 15:26.120
Sometimes dreams are like that.

15:28.040 --> 15:31.680
Sometimes the details are
dead-on, and other times...

15:34.840 --> 15:36.560
I-I don't know. This...

15:38.000 --> 15:41.080
This whole thing
doesn't sit right.

15:43.280 --> 15:44.240
You know what you need?

15:48.360 --> 15:49.640
I was thinking dinner.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.800
ALLISON:
 <i>Ariel, hang up the phone!</i>

15:52.880 --> 15:55.760
All right, time for the
daily phone intervention.

15:58.840 --> 16:02.480
You seem awfully taciturn,
young lady.

16:07.640 --> 16:08.400
Bridgette.

16:09.280 --> 16:10.440
Honey, we have a guest.

16:10.440 --> 16:11.480
The polite thing to do

16:11.480 --> 16:14.640
when you have a guest is
to make conversation.

16:16.560 --> 16:18.760
Why don't you tell Captain
Push about your day?

16:19.720 --> 16:21.080
Yes, indeed.

16:21.280 --> 16:22.600
Tell me
about your day.

16:26.160 --> 16:26.720
Okay.

16:26.720 --> 16:27.880
Well...
(chuckles)

16:28.840 --> 16:30.560
...doesn't have to be
about your day.

16:31.320 --> 16:33.640
Tell me about anything.

16:34.320 --> 16:36.320
Tell me what's
on your mind.

16:37.400 --> 16:38.520
I'd love to hear it.

16:38.920 --> 16:40.160
I'm a pretty
good listener.

16:40.720 --> 16:42.160
I don't want to tell you.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.160
Well, okay.

16:47.840 --> 16:48.680
Just...

16:50.040 --> 16:53.120
sometimes it's good to get
things off your chest.

16:54.160 --> 16:55.880
Especially if something's
bothering you.

16:56.480 --> 16:57.720
You won't like it.

16:59.840 --> 17:01.560
I won't like what's
bothering you?

17:02.240 --> 17:03.960
It's against the law.

17:04.440 --> 17:07.800
Oh, you did something
against the law?

17:08.440 --> 17:10.680
No. My daddy did.

17:12.079 --> 17:13.839
Bridgette,
what are you talking about?

17:15.280 --> 17:17.839
I saw Daddy smoking drugs.

17:18.160 --> 17:19.200
Daddy?

17:19.400 --> 17:22.359
I saw Daddy smoking drugs!

17:24.359 --> 17:25.319
All right, here we are.

17:25.319 --> 17:26.680
One big, happy, fam...

17:26.960 --> 17:28.400
ALLISON:
Hey, shh...

17:28.680 --> 17:29.160
Bridge?

17:29.160 --> 17:29.760
Shh!

17:29.760 --> 17:32.040
Don't throw my daddy in jail!

17:33.120 --> 17:33.960
Jail?

17:35.000 --> 17:36.440
Daddy, are you going
to jail?

17:36.760 --> 17:37.800
What?  What's she
talking about?

17:37.800 --> 17:38.680
Mom?

17:38.760 --> 17:40.280
Ariel, just don't
talk right now.

17:40.280 --> 17:41.840
Sit down, just
eat your dinner.

17:43.080 --> 17:44.800
Bridgette, honey,
how about you and me

17:44.800 --> 17:46.720
go in your room and
talk about this, okay?

17:47.480 --> 17:48.080
Come on.

17:48.080 --> 17:50.080
I'm sorry, Daddy.
I'm sorry.

17:50.080 --> 17:50.840
Did I miss something?

17:50.840 --> 17:51.800
Wh-What's going on?

17:52.280 --> 17:53.920
Just entertain our guest.

17:56.800 --> 17:59.760
Okay, you're upset.
I can see that.

18:02.440 --> 18:04.960
But to be honest with you,
I'm mystified.

18:06.560 --> 18:07.640
You're mystified?

18:07.920 --> 18:10.200
Apparently, your daughter looked
you straight in the eye

18:10.200 --> 18:12.520
and asked you if you
ever did drugs, if you
would ever do drugs.

18:12.520 --> 18:13.880
And you said?
"Never."

18:14.240 --> 18:16.080
I admit it-- that's
what I said, "Never."

18:16.240 --> 18:17.880
Which way to
the electric chair?

18:17.880 --> 18:18.760
You lied!

18:19.520 --> 18:21.360
Uh, yeah, you're
damn right I lied.

18:21.360 --> 18:22.400
And I would do it again.

18:23.640 --> 18:25.080
Are you forgetting?
She's eight.

18:25.560 --> 18:27.280
We can't expect her
to understand things

18:27.280 --> 18:29.000
either of us might have done
years ago.

18:29.200 --> 18:30.560
Before we were a family.

18:30.640 --> 18:32.640
She's not old enough to
understand the social context

18:32.640 --> 18:34.400
of college life in the '80s.

18:35.840 --> 18:36.680
She's a kid.

18:36.960 --> 18:38.800
Yeah, she's a kid who
sees things!

18:39.080 --> 18:40.320
Things that make
her really smart

18:40.320 --> 18:41.480
about being able
to know

18:41.480 --> 18:43.320
who's telling the truth
and who's lying.

18:43.600 --> 18:44.840
Is that what
this is about?

18:45.400 --> 18:48.080
She saw me?
Smoking something?
In her head?

18:48.400 --> 18:50.800
Well, I hope you told
her it wasn't true.
No!

18:50.960 --> 18:51.440
What?!

18:51.440 --> 18:53.760
Joe, I spent my
entire childhood

18:53.840 --> 18:55.560
having my mother tell me
the things I saw

18:55.560 --> 18:56.640
in my head were nonsense.

18:56.640 --> 18:57.880
I'm not doing that
to my girls.

18:57.880 --> 18:59.320
But this isn't about you
and your mother.

18:59.320 --> 19:00.680
It's about me and
my daughter.

19:01.320 --> 19:02.120
So what did you tell her?

19:02.120 --> 19:04.680
I said, "If Daddy did that,

19:05.160 --> 19:08.800
"it was probably a
really long, long time ago,

19:09.280 --> 19:12.080
and he fibbed about
it because he was ashamed."

19:14.000 --> 19:14.760
Ashamed.

19:15.240 --> 19:16.880
Well, you're not
proud of it, are you?

19:17.160 --> 19:20.400
It's not... one of the
highlights of my life, no.

19:20.400 --> 19:21.760
But I don't think
I would describe it

19:21.760 --> 19:23.480
as a period of
enormous shame either.

19:24.360 --> 19:26.000
Well, I didn't have
a lot of choices.

19:26.080 --> 19:27.240
You'd already
lied to her.

19:27.240 --> 19:28.360
She was already
hysterical.

19:28.360 --> 19:29.800
So now she thinks
I'm a liar,

19:29.800 --> 19:31.840
a drug addict and
filled with shame.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.480
You can't lie
to these kids.

19:33.480 --> 19:34.600
What would you
prefer that I said?

19:34.600 --> 19:35.480
Wait, forget that.

19:35.480 --> 19:37.960
What if she had asked you,
Miss Holier-Than-Thou?

19:37.960 --> 19:38.840
Or are you
forgetting

19:38.840 --> 19:40.280
your own sordid past?

19:40.280 --> 19:41.800
I'm not forgetting anything.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.960
I'd like to hope that I would
find a way to tell my child

19:44.960 --> 19:46.400
that people make mistakes.

19:46.800 --> 19:49.200
People learn and they change
and they grow.

19:49.200 --> 19:51.880
And it is every parent's wish
that their child

19:52.240 --> 19:53.800
avoid making the same
bad choices

19:53.800 --> 19:55.120
their parents might have made.

19:55.120 --> 19:57.360
Ooh, aren't we
impressive?

19:57.720 --> 19:59.720
In the safety of our bed,
in the safety of our room,

19:59.720 --> 20:01.280
with no children
anywhere in sight,

20:01.280 --> 20:02.920
giving you that
eight-year-old stare.

20:03.280 --> 20:04.360
Oh, well,
okay, fine.

20:04.360 --> 20:05.680
We'll just
see, won't we?

20:07.320 --> 20:08.080
'Cause the next time

20:08.080 --> 20:10.400
the word "drugs"
or "sex"

20:10.480 --> 20:11.840
or "tattoos"
or "piercings"

20:11.840 --> 20:14.120
comes out of one of our
psychic children's mouths,

20:14.240 --> 20:15.840
I'm tossing you in
front of the bus.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.200
And don't think
I won't do it.

20:17.400 --> 20:19.320
You're so lucky
that couch is taken.

20:19.320 --> 20:21.520
I'm a lot of things, but
lucky ain't one of them.

20:36.280 --> 20:37.640
I-I don't understand.

20:37.640 --> 20:39.920
Why didn't you tell me
about this dream before?

20:40.000 --> 20:41.360
PUSH:
There was nothing to tell.

20:42.120 --> 20:44.720
It was a couple people
I wasn't even sure existed

20:44.720 --> 20:48.160
doing things in places
that had no names, no location.

20:48.360 --> 20:50.280
Well, not till tonight, anyway.

20:50.280 --> 20:51.640
It was a dream,

20:51.800 --> 20:53.240
for crying out loud.

21:09.560 --> 21:10.720
Pretty much nailed it.

21:10.880 --> 21:12.520
Harrigan Construction
and Demolition.

21:14.560 --> 21:15.680
Killed the guy
in the guardhouse,

21:15.680 --> 21:17.720
cut a couple locks with torches,
then made off with

21:17.720 --> 21:19.640
almost half a dozen
bricks of C-4.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.080
They... they cut the locks
with torches?

21:25.400 --> 21:25.760
Well, whatever.

21:25.760 --> 21:27.200
The end result's
virtually the same.

21:27.760 --> 21:29.600
I'd say, uh,
you're two for two, lady.

21:30.280 --> 21:31.040
Captain.

21:35.160 --> 21:36.880
I'd say you're
two for two, fella.

21:37.160 --> 21:40.440
So, these people, now they have
an ambulance and explosives.

21:40.440 --> 21:41.960
You didn't happen
to have a dream

21:42.280 --> 21:44.560
that you didn't share with me
that might shed some light

21:44.560 --> 21:45.720
on what they're
planning on doing

21:45.720 --> 21:47.360
with a bunch of explosives,
did you?

21:47.360 --> 21:48.000
No.

21:48.200 --> 21:50.680
But even if I did, and
even if there were,

21:52.040 --> 21:54.520
I'm not sure I'd be inclined to
believe what it was showing me.

21:56.160 --> 21:58.360
This place,
that building,

21:58.760 --> 22:00.000
it's all...
it's not right.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.520
It's not what I saw.

22:02.400 --> 22:03.360
What are you talking about?

22:03.360 --> 22:06.040
Harrigan Construction,
just like in your dream.

22:06.040 --> 22:09.480
Yeah, the name's the same, but
everything else is different.

22:11.040 --> 22:13.160
The... buildings,

22:13.640 --> 22:14.760
the lettering
on the sign,

22:14.760 --> 22:17.280
there's no guard shack
at the main gate,

22:17.280 --> 22:20.040
nobody was cutting any
locks with torches.

22:21.120 --> 22:22.720
This is all...

22:23.880 --> 22:24.840
wrong.

22:39.320 --> 22:40.560
Didn't you
mention to me

22:40.560 --> 22:43.560
that the woman's chin
was more triangular?

22:47.560 --> 22:48.640
Oh, yeah, yeah.

22:48.640 --> 22:49.880
I did, yeah.

22:50.360 --> 22:53.240
Uh, actually, I think I used
that word "triangular."

22:53.320 --> 22:54.480
Her chin.

22:59.840 --> 23:00.800
Excuse me.

23:08.880 --> 23:09.720
It's sad.

23:10.960 --> 23:14.040
She has a keen intuition
but a feeble memory.

23:14.920 --> 23:15.480
Yeah.

23:15.480 --> 23:17.680
Of course I can bring him down
early this evening.

23:20.840 --> 23:22.280
ALLISON:
Uh, excuse me.

23:23.040 --> 23:23.920
(whispers):
Yeah.

23:26.680 --> 23:28.720
That was the hospital
returning my call.

23:29.680 --> 23:31.880
When is the last time
you saw your doctor in Texas?

23:32.440 --> 23:35.120
There's some issue
with your pacemaker.

23:35.600 --> 23:37.920
They want to open you up
and fix whatever it is.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.560
They want me to bring you
in there this evening,

23:40.120 --> 23:41.200
do the procedure in the morning.

23:41.200 --> 23:42.600
It's not supposed
to be a big deal.

23:44.840 --> 23:45.960
Are you gonna say anything?

23:48.760 --> 23:52.000
You and your family
ever had real Texas chili?

23:52.880 --> 23:54.400
I call the phone!

23:54.400 --> 23:57.200
Don't worry, no one's
gonna want the dumb old phone.

23:57.280 --> 23:57.960
Girls...

24:07.840 --> 24:09.840
It's nice of you to offer
to make dinner, but...

24:11.000 --> 24:12.080
No buts.

24:13.040 --> 24:14.840
Chili's a man's job.

24:16.680 --> 24:17.920
Besides, if I
let you help me,

24:17.920 --> 24:20.040
you might find out
my secret recipe.

24:20.120 --> 24:22.040
Now, just go...

24:23.280 --> 24:24.800
take a bath or something.

24:26.240 --> 24:27.800
Come back and get me
when it's time

24:27.800 --> 24:29.240
to drive me to the hospital.

24:30.560 --> 24:32.000
You drive a
hard bargain.

24:53.680 --> 24:54.440
You want to help?

24:54.920 --> 24:56.000
What are you making?

24:57.440 --> 24:58.880
Finest Texas chili

25:00.480 --> 25:02.400
this side of the Colorado River.

25:03.640 --> 25:05.200
Wait till you taste it.

25:06.840 --> 25:08.440
That's okay. I'm not hungry.

25:08.440 --> 25:11.320
It's hard to have an appetite
when your daddy's a liar.

25:18.600 --> 25:19.680
(whispers):
Come here.

25:25.240 --> 25:26.280
Whoa, baby.

25:32.640 --> 25:35.000
I understand how
you feel, by the way.

25:35.600 --> 25:36.440
Oh, yeah?

25:36.640 --> 25:37.720
Sure.

25:37.880 --> 25:38.760
Somebody I trusted

25:38.760 --> 25:40.200
told me a lie once.

25:43.280 --> 25:44.720
My mama.

25:44.720 --> 25:45.560
Your mom?

25:47.680 --> 25:49.320
It was a big lie, too.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.240
See... my daddy left

25:55.240 --> 25:56.600
when I was a baby.

25:57.760 --> 26:00.720
Once I got old enough to ask
after his whereabouts...

26:02.920 --> 26:04.760
my mama told me
he was dead.

26:05.520 --> 26:06.680
And he wasn't?

26:07.040 --> 26:09.360
He was alive and tearing it up.

26:12.520 --> 26:14.440
Were you mad
at your mom for lying?

26:14.720 --> 26:16.840
Oh, heck yeah,
I was mad.

26:18.280 --> 26:21.360
The next day, I joined
the Texas Rangers,

26:21.640 --> 26:24.520
learned how to track a man,
so I could find my daddy.

26:25.840 --> 26:27.560
And did you
find him?

26:29.480 --> 26:30.720
I found him, all right.

26:31.880 --> 26:33.920
Was in a bar
outside El Paso.

26:34.200 --> 26:36.320
And he wasn't fit to be
anybody's daddy.

26:38.800 --> 26:41.960
Man was a mean-spirited,
card-cheating,

26:41.960 --> 26:43.680
lying, angry drunk.

26:44.920 --> 26:46.840
Didn't care anything
about anybody.

26:47.120 --> 26:49.360
Sure wasn't proud
to see how I turned out.

26:50.120 --> 26:51.080
Wow.

26:51.280 --> 26:52.040
Yeah.

26:52.720 --> 26:53.960
You know what I did?

26:54.800 --> 26:56.040
I went crawling home

26:56.040 --> 26:58.280
to my mama and begged her
to forgive me

26:58.280 --> 26:59.600
for how I treated her.

27:00.360 --> 27:01.720
And did she forgive you?

27:01.800 --> 27:02.680
Of course.

27:02.680 --> 27:05.080
She knew what kind of man
my daddy really was.

27:05.560 --> 27:07.760
And she knew
how upset I'd be

27:07.760 --> 27:09.880
if I ever found out
the truth.

27:10.240 --> 27:13.240
Which is why
she told me that lie.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
I was too bull-headed
to understand it,

27:16.120 --> 27:16.960
but she lied to me

27:16.960 --> 27:19.080
because she loved me.

27:20.600 --> 27:22.920
She lied to me to protect me.

27:24.560 --> 27:25.800
We understand each other?

27:28.080 --> 27:29.040
I think so.

27:29.160 --> 27:29.800
Good.

27:31.840 --> 27:32.600
So...

27:34.720 --> 27:37.960
why don't you put those
tomatoes in that pot?

27:47.640 --> 27:51.280
I er tell you how much
I hate these places?

27:52.160 --> 27:53.040
That's peculiar.

27:53.040 --> 27:55.440
Most of the people I know
love going to the hospital.

27:55.440 --> 27:56.880
They can't get enough of it.

27:59.720 --> 28:00.680
MAN:
Captain Push.

28:03.200 --> 28:03.760
I'm sorry to keep you.

28:03.760 --> 28:05.120
My 5:00 ran long.

28:05.400 --> 28:08.360
I'm Dr. Sanborn,
head of Cardiology here at Phoenix General.

28:09.040 --> 28:09.800
Welcome back.

28:15.640 --> 28:16.440
Be nice.
 (chuckles)

28:17.400 --> 28:19.600
This is my friend,
Allison Dubois.

28:19.680 --> 28:20.560
Nice to meet you.

28:21.120 --> 28:23.520
The physician who actually did
your surgery

28:23.520 --> 28:24.680
is out of the country.

28:25.240 --> 28:27.160
This is a fairly
minor procedure.

28:27.360 --> 28:28.320
If you're agreeable,

28:28.600 --> 28:29.840
I can certainly take
care of it for you.

28:30.920 --> 28:32.720
Frankly, the sooner
you get it done...

28:32.920 --> 28:35.040
I mean, there have been
a couple of product failures.

28:35.320 --> 28:37.520
Well, head of the department.
You can't get better than that.

28:41.760 --> 28:44.720
So, have, uh, Mike and Janice
stopped by to say hello?

28:47.000 --> 28:50.360
I'm sorry,
Mike and Janice?

28:50.840 --> 28:52.680
Apparently, they were
your ICU nurses

28:52.680 --> 28:53.840
when you were a patient here.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.640
It's okay
if you don't remember.

28:56.400 --> 28:58.320
I'm told you were in a coma
for much of your stay.

28:59.400 --> 29:01.400
And I'm told
I'm absolutely
delightful

29:01.400 --> 29:03.040
to be with when
I'm in a coma.

29:04.560 --> 29:06.400
Seriously, you woke up.

29:06.760 --> 29:07.840
I know it doesn't sound
like much,

29:07.840 --> 29:11.200
but given the depth
and duration of your coma,

29:11.960 --> 29:13.280
it's something of a minor
miracle.

29:14.560 --> 29:15.520
When you work
the ICU,

29:15.520 --> 29:16.840
you remember the miracles.

29:19.040 --> 29:19.920
Hey!

29:31.320 --> 29:32.280
Nice.

29:32.280 --> 29:34.880
Yeah, I think
it might actually
be the same room

29:34.880 --> 29:36.200
as I had last time.

29:36.680 --> 29:38.920
No, you were in a lot
of different rooms
last time.

29:38.920 --> 29:41.000
When you were here,
you were in big rooms

29:41.800 --> 29:42.840
with a lot of beds.

29:42.920 --> 29:44.560
Private rooms like this.

29:45.040 --> 29:46.880
They all kind
of look alike,
but no.

29:47.920 --> 29:49.440
I see you have
your sleeping pill

29:49.440 --> 29:51.760
and your fashionable
sleeping attire.

29:52.320 --> 29:53.760
You're just jealous.

29:55.200 --> 29:57.400
I did a little
checking on your two
favorite nurses.

29:57.520 --> 29:58.080
It turns out

29:58.080 --> 30:00.200
they were both working
the night shift all week

30:00.560 --> 30:02.200
so there's no way they could
have been here and...

30:05.280 --> 30:07.200
They've been at the
hospital forever.

30:07.200 --> 30:09.320
Everyone describes them
as "lifers."

30:10.080 --> 30:11.600
And everyone just
adores them.

30:12.680 --> 30:16.120
So they're neither
my ambulance-jackers

30:16.120 --> 30:18.400
nor my explosives thieves.

30:18.520 --> 30:21.000
No, just really
great nurses.

30:23.880 --> 30:27.720
Uh... Joe's gonna be walking
in the door right about now.

30:28.400 --> 30:31.760
Hey, I promise you
I will be here
in the morning

30:31.760 --> 30:33.560
before you get out
of surgery, okay?

30:34.800 --> 30:36.440
What if I have another dream?

30:38.440 --> 30:40.680
Seriously, if you need
anything, call me.

30:49.400 --> 30:50.440
Daddy's home.

30:53.120 --> 30:54.200
Hold your applause.

30:57.080 --> 30:59.000
Hey.
Hey.

30:59.560 --> 31:01.080
Mom had to drive
Captain Push

31:01.080 --> 31:02.440
to the hospital
for something.

31:02.440 --> 31:03.680
I don't think it was
a big deal, though,

31:03.680 --> 31:06.160
because he made his chili
before she took him.

31:06.280 --> 31:08.000
Mm, chili. Excellent.

31:09.360 --> 31:10.480
Where are your sisters?

31:10.680 --> 31:12.520
Um, Marie fell asleep
on my bed.

31:12.520 --> 31:13.960
I was reading her
a story.

31:15.680 --> 31:16.240
That's all right.

31:16.240 --> 31:17.680
I'll carry her
back to her room.

31:18.160 --> 31:20.480
And Bridgette's
been getting ready
for bed

31:20.480 --> 31:22.200
for, like, an hour
and a half.

31:22.280 --> 31:22.960
Yeah?

31:23.040 --> 31:24.600
I think she's waiting
for a kiss.

31:26.040 --> 31:26.880
From me?

31:28.120 --> 31:29.960
The fugitive? The liar?

31:30.360 --> 31:31.400
I don't think so.

31:35.520 --> 31:37.240
Bridge, it's Daddy.

31:37.920 --> 31:39.560
I just want to let you know
that I'm here

31:40.240 --> 31:41.360
if you want a kiss.

31:41.960 --> 31:44.160
If you want to wait
for Mommy, that's cool, too.

31:45.200 --> 31:46.560
Oh! Hey!

31:46.840 --> 31:47.800
Bridge...

31:48.080 --> 31:49.640
I'm so glad
you're home!

31:49.920 --> 31:52.480
Oh, God, I'm glad
to be home.

31:52.800 --> 31:54.320
It's good to be
home with you.

31:54.600 --> 31:56.040
It's good to
see you, honey.

31:56.240 --> 31:57.400
I made you a picture.

31:58.440 --> 32:00.440
It's of you and me
on the carousel.

32:00.440 --> 32:01.880
Yeah?
Do you like it?

32:02.080 --> 32:04.480
Doesn't it look
exactly like you?

32:04.600 --> 32:06.320
I like it.
Of course, I like it.

32:06.320 --> 32:07.840
Look at that.
It looks just like me.

32:08.120 --> 32:10.520
Oh, Daddy,
you're such a liar.

32:18.280 --> 32:20.680
MAN'S VOICE: 
The key to it is getting
an ambulance.

32:20.680 --> 32:22.600
Ambulances
can go anywhere.

32:22.600 --> 32:24.800
Nobody questions
an ambulance.

32:25.400 --> 32:27.320
Okay, but how do we get our
hands on one?

32:27.320 --> 32:28.280
We take it.

32:28.640 --> 32:30.280
We call for one
and we take it.

32:30.560 --> 32:31.160
Really?

32:31.160 --> 32:33.160
Don't they usually show up
with people attached?

32:33.440 --> 32:35.000
EMT's, doctors,
whatever?

32:35.560 --> 32:36.440
I don't understand

32:36.440 --> 32:38.240
why you're having
difficulty with this.

32:38.520 --> 32:40.640
You've never disposed
of a body before?

32:41.200 --> 32:44.400
Aren't you the one
who taught me about
Desolation Junction?

32:45.160 --> 32:47.240
Come on, this
is a good idea.

32:47.560 --> 32:49.080
I need you
to get on board.

32:49.960 --> 32:53.680
Fine. Fine, I'm on board.

32:54.240 --> 32:56.000
But I still don't get it.

32:56.160 --> 32:57.520
How do we get you
out of here?

32:57.800 --> 32:59.040
I don't know.

32:59.360 --> 33:00.000
We're going to need

33:00.000 --> 33:02.040
a huge distraction.

33:02.320 --> 33:03.760
An explosion, maybe.

33:04.040 --> 33:06.720
You know how to get your hands
on explosive, don't you?

33:06.920 --> 33:07.960
Yeah, of course I do.

33:08.560 --> 33:10.480
It's why God invented
construction companies.

33:11.240 --> 33:13.040
I'm confused.
I mean,when is this
gonna happen?

33:13.160 --> 33:14.400
The court order
says they have

33:14.400 --> 33:17.200
to schedule
a hospital visit
for me every year,

33:17.200 --> 33:19.200
year and a half
to check for polyps.

33:20.240 --> 33:23.120
So, ideally, it would
be the next time I'm here.

33:23.320 --> 33:24.680
What about
collateral damage?

33:24.680 --> 33:25.800
There's gonna be smoke.

33:26.200 --> 33:27.520
We want to knock out
the power.

33:27.720 --> 33:29.160
What about all
your roommates here?

33:29.760 --> 33:30.720
These guys?
(scoffs)

33:31.680 --> 33:33.000
They're halfway gone already.

33:33.280 --> 33:34.440
Comas, worse.

33:34.640 --> 33:35.400
That guy over there,

33:35.400 --> 33:37.120
he's a cop of some kind
from Texas.

33:37.520 --> 33:38.960
Been unconscious
for months.

33:39.040 --> 33:40.600
We'd probably be doing him
a favor.

33:41.080 --> 33:43.440
NURSE:
Captain Push?
Are you awake?

33:43.760 --> 33:44.880
Captain Push?

33:46.320 --> 33:48.080
Hi. It's 5:00 a.m.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.800
I'm here to take you
down to surgery.

33:54.280 --> 33:55.240
There we go.

34:00.800 --> 34:04.000
Hmm, we have a little
extra security in
place today.

34:04.760 --> 34:06.080
I'll be right back.

34:06.360 --> 34:08.120
I'm gonna make a run for it.

34:21.440 --> 34:22.960
Yeah, he's in with the doctors
right now.

34:25.280 --> 34:26.520
Don't worry about where
I got it.

34:27.480 --> 34:29.480
That's why God invented
construction companies.

34:29.880 --> 34:31.600
Just wait
for my signal.

34:38.520 --> 34:39.560
How do I feel?

34:39.760 --> 34:41.000
How do you think I feel?

34:41.080 --> 34:41.880
I don't know.

34:41.880 --> 34:43.480
How'd you like to have
three feet of tubing

34:43.480 --> 34:44.760
shoved up your ass?

34:48.960 --> 34:51.920
All right, Captain Push,
I'll take you in now.

34:52.600 --> 34:55.679
That man cuffed to the chair
with that guard,

34:55.679 --> 34:56.520
who was that?

34:56.719 --> 35:00.360
Um, I believe his name
is Sergei something.

35:00.760 --> 35:03.360
Supposedly, he's with
the Serbian mob.

35:03.440 --> 35:05.360
Or maybe it's Bosnian,
I'm not sure.

35:05.760 --> 35:07.280
They brought him in
from the state penitentiary

35:07.280 --> 35:08.720
to have a colonoscopy.

35:08.800 --> 35:11.680
I swear, those prisoners have
a better medical plan than I do.

35:11.880 --> 35:14.000
Has he been in here before,
this hospital?

35:14.360 --> 35:17.080
Actually, yeah, about a year,
maybe a year and a half ago.

35:17.080 --> 35:18.200
He had some polyps
removed.

35:18.200 --> 35:19.160
When they bring
a prisoner in,

35:19.160 --> 35:21.080
they tighten up security
all over the hospital.

35:21.080 --> 35:22.440
It's a real pain
in the neck.

35:23.000 --> 35:23.760
All right.

35:24.360 --> 35:25.800
Now, you're gonna feel
a little woozy.

35:25.800 --> 35:27.600
I've got to get to a phone,
make a call.

35:27.600 --> 35:28.680
No, now is

35:28.680 --> 35:30.120
probably not a good time.

35:30.120 --> 35:31.360
There you go.

35:32.200 --> 35:33.000
Okay?

35:34.400 --> 35:37.960
(slurring):
Phone... it's important.

35:37.960 --> 35:39.680
Don't you worry,
Captain Push,

35:40.160 --> 35:42.200
everything's gonna be
just fine.

35:42.360 --> 35:43.640
Fine...

35:45.920 --> 35:49.080
Doctor, please call.

35:49.280 --> 35:50.640
Please call.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.640
What's he saying,
"police" or "please"?

35:52.640 --> 35:55.120
Please call.???

35:55.240 --> 35:57.240
Let's give the cowboy
a little more fairy dust.

35:57.640 --> 35:59.360
Make sure he's completely
in dream land.

35:59.360 --> 36:00.520
Call... (mumbling)

36:04.440 --> 36:05.320
Ah!

36:05.960 --> 36:06.640
What the hell?

36:13.440 --> 36:14.120
Yeah.

36:18.840 --> 36:19.880
(alarms blaring)
Let's get him out of here.

36:19.960 --> 36:21.720
Come on. Give me a hand.

36:26.200 --> 36:28.240
Let's go this way.
Go this way.

36:29.000 --> 36:29.840
Wait, wait, wait.

36:30.920 --> 36:31.560
Over here.

36:35.520 --> 36:35.880
Go, go, go, go!

36:35.880 --> 36:37.520
Go, go, go!

36:37.520 --> 36:38.680
Please help.

36:40.960 --> 36:41.920
It's all right, cowboy.

36:43.480 --> 36:45.480
Please call...

36:46.160 --> 36:48.080
Shine that flashlight!
I can't see a damn thing!

36:55.560 --> 36:56.120
Let's hurry.

36:56.120 --> 36:57.680
Don't worry.
The ambulance is waiting.

37:04.080 --> 37:05.640
Allison, what
are you doing?
What's going on?

37:06.120 --> 37:07.720
Lay back down.
It's 3:00 in the morning.

37:08.120 --> 37:10.320
It's 3:00?

37:10.720 --> 37:11.680
Are you sure?

37:11.840 --> 37:13.120
I don't know.
It's dark.

37:13.200 --> 37:14.720
Clock says 3:00.
I'm pretty sure.

37:14.920 --> 37:16.360
They haven't operated yet.

37:16.840 --> 37:18.080
Then there's still time.

37:19.040 --> 37:19.920
Time for what?

37:20.200 --> 37:23.840
NURSE: Captain Push.
Hi. It's 5:00 a.m.

37:23.960 --> 37:25.560
I'm here to take you
down to surgery.

37:27.120 --> 37:28.920
I'll be back
in a moment, okay?

37:30.840 --> 37:31.600
How did you sleep?

37:31.600 --> 37:32.880
Did you get any sleep at all?

37:33.440 --> 37:35.560
Allison, this is important.

37:35.560 --> 37:36.800
We don't have much time.

37:37.480 --> 37:38.120
You calm down.

37:38.120 --> 37:39.680
There's a plan I heard about

37:40.240 --> 37:41.960
when I was in a coma
a year and a half ago.

37:41.960 --> 37:42.840
Okay, I believe you.

37:42.840 --> 37:45.600
They're gonna blow up
this hospital today.

37:46.000 --> 37:46.880
Minutes from now.

37:47.640 --> 37:49.720
It's got nothing to do with
seeing the future,

37:49.720 --> 37:51.280
nothing to do with dreams.

37:51.840 --> 37:52.600
You got to believe me.

37:52.600 --> 37:53.880
I know what I'm talking about.

37:55.880 --> 37:59.920
I'm a lawman,
I'm not psychic.

38:01.440 --> 38:04.040
Yeah, but I am.

38:08.040 --> 38:09.800
You can stop pacing any time.

38:10.920 --> 38:12.200
I can see the ambulance
parked out there

38:12.200 --> 38:13.800
and your crew hasn't lit
the fuse yet.

38:14.000 --> 38:14.880
What's the problem?

38:15.920 --> 38:16.880
They're paid to be thorough.

38:16.880 --> 38:18.040
Let them be thorough.

38:22.040 --> 38:23.000
Time to go.

38:23.680 --> 38:24.920
It is that, gentlemen.

38:26.360 --> 38:28.280
And don't even think ????

38:32.320 --> 38:33.960
PUSH:
Oh, that'll be my cab.

38:34.320 --> 38:35.400
I'm gonna go see.

38:35.600 --> 38:36.360
Me, too.

38:36.360 --> 38:37.320
Me three.

38:37.320 --> 38:40.280
You know, you should've let us
drive you to the airport.

38:40.360 --> 38:42.280
Oh, please, it's Sunday.

38:42.600 --> 38:44.040
Besides, y'all have already
extended me

38:44.040 --> 38:47.280
way more hospitality than anyone
has a right to expect.

38:47.280 --> 38:48.440
Nonsense.
True.

38:49.600 --> 38:50.360
Let me get that.

38:51.040 --> 38:51.800
Thank you.

38:57.240 --> 39:00.600
Well, I guess this is it.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.040
It? You think so?

39:02.040 --> 39:04.240
Something tells me
you will be back.

39:06.000 --> 39:06.840
What do you mean?

39:07.800 --> 39:09.720
You think I might need
another tune-up.

39:10.880 --> 39:12.600
(chuckles):
What do I look like,
a fortune teller?

39:12.800 --> 39:14.520
I just sense
that you'll be back.

39:16.440 --> 39:17.480
Till we meet again.

39:20.840 --> 39:25.080
Oh, if you see my daddy's ghost,
please tell him

39:25.080 --> 39:27.480
I'm sorry I had to tell
such a tall tale about him.

39:29.680 --> 39:30.840
He'll understand.

39:34.840 --> 39:37.440
Ask your middle child.
She knows all about it.
