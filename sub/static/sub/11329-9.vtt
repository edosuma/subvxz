<i>Previously on The Secret Life
Of The American Teenager...</i>

00:03.037 --> 00:05.409
Hey, Amy, I'm sorry
about Ben and Adrian,

00:05.444 --> 00:08.513
and
- and I'm sorry about Ricky and me.

00:08.547 --> 00:10.047
I wish I had never kissed him.

00:10.082 --> 00:11.983
Amy is not talking to anyone.

00:12.017 --> 00:13.451
She's not talking to anyone who knew

00:13.485 --> 00:15.486
that Adrian's having your
baby and didn't tell her.

00:15.521 --> 00:17.922
I know that it is slightly unorthodox

00:17.956 --> 00:20.858
for me to be going out with a guy
who's having a baby with my best friend.

00:20.893 --> 00:22.860
If that's what I wanna do,
then that's what I wanna do.

00:22.895 --> 00:25.863
You know I care about your sister,
but you also know I care about you.

00:25.898 --> 00:28.366
Do I know that? No, I don't know that.

00:28.400 --> 00:30.368
I'm Dr. Attavi. Adrian.

00:30.402 --> 00:31.836
Hi.

00:33.005 --> 00:34.372
Don't worry. I'm not staying.

00:34.406 --> 00:37.208
Who are you going out with? Ben.

00:37.242 --> 00:41.345
As long as you're working on forgiveness,
think about forgiving Adrian, will you?

00:48.253 --> 00:49.887
There's something I wanna say to you.

00:49.922 --> 00:51.889
Say anything you want. I can take it.

00:51.924 --> 00:54.592
There were a few times when you came
up to me and offered to be my friend.

00:54.626 --> 00:56.394
<i>I just wanna know if
that offer still stands.</i>

00:56.428 --> 00:57.528
Friends?

00:57.563 --> 01:00.031
Friends.

01:03.101 --> 01:05.001
What's wrong with being Ricky's friend?

01:05.037 --> 01:06.704
I knew you weren't
getting anywhere with Ricky

01:06.738 --> 01:08.873
other than just getting
that kiss from Ricky.

01:08.907 --> 01:11.475
I didn't say there's anything
wrong with being friends?

01:11.510 --> 01:13.744
It's just that, you know,
we're not really friends.

01:13.779 --> 01:15.780
We're just acting like friends.

01:15.814 --> 01:17.648
And, you know, maybe that kiss

01:17.683 --> 01:19.584
was all I wanted out of
the relationship anyway.

01:19.618 --> 01:22.019
Maybe, but I doubt it. Why?

01:22.054 --> 01:24.255
Because you told your
sister about that kiss.

01:24.289 --> 01:26.924
I mean, there must be some reason
you told your sister about that kiss.

01:28.160 --> 01:30.294
Were you angry and just blurted it out,

01:30.329 --> 01:31.629
or did you do that intentionally?

01:31.663 --> 01:32.897
The same result.

01:32.931 --> 01:34.932
Either way, she's not speaking to me.

01:34.967 --> 01:36.734
You two weren't speaking before that.

01:36.768 --> 01:38.703
She's not speaking to anyone, is she?

01:38.737 --> 01:40.204
No, not that I know of.

01:40.239 --> 01:41.939
Oh, except for Ricky.
Ricky heard from her.

01:41.974 --> 01:44.208
About the kiss. She
called to yell at him

01:44.243 --> 01:46.410
when she found out about the kiss.

01:46.445 --> 01:48.346
Oh, come on, Ashley. You told her

01:48.380 --> 01:49.914
just because you
wanted to cause trouble,

01:49.948 --> 01:51.949
because you're not really happy
just being friends with Ricky.

01:51.984 --> 01:54.452
I don't want to cause trouble.

01:54.486 --> 01:57.655
Sometimes I just do.

01:57.689 --> 01:59.690
I need you to get Grant to call me.

01:59.725 --> 02:01.192
He hasn't been returning my calls.

02:01.226 --> 02:02.960
You called him again? Yes, I called him.

02:02.995 --> 02:05.162
And he didn't call you
back? I just said that.

02:05.197 --> 02:06.831
Then I guess he doesn't
wanna talk to you,

02:06.865 --> 02:08.666
so I don't think I can
get him to call you back.

02:08.699 --> 02:10.634
Yes, you can. What am
I supposed to tell him?

02:10.669 --> 02:11.969
That I want him to calme.

02:12.004 --> 02:15.273
Well, obviously he knows that.

02:15.307 --> 02:18.242
All right. I'll ask him. But you
know what? If he doesn't call-

02:18.277 --> 02:19.744
If he doesn't call, he doesn't call.

02:19.778 --> 02:21.879
And if he does call, he's my cousin.

02:21.914 --> 02:23.648
I don't want you using my cousin.

02:23.682 --> 02:26.350
So don't go out with him
just to cause more trouble.

02:26.385 --> 02:30.254
You and I are friends, but not if
you keep using my cousin, all right?

02:30.289 --> 02:32.256
Wait just a minute. Yeah.

02:32.291 --> 02:35.192
You know, this is all your
fault. You set me up with him.

02:35.227 --> 02:36.627
I didn't ask to be set up with him.

02:36.662 --> 02:38.262
And now you think I'm using him?

02:38.297 --> 02:40.464
You could be. Yeah. How?

02:40.499 --> 02:42.934
How? You're not friends with Ricky.

02:42.968 --> 02:46.237
He may be friends with you, but you're
not really just friends with him.

02:46.271 --> 02:49.540
So now you're trying to make
him jealous again with Grant.

02:49.574 --> 02:51.943
And maybe that's all you
were ever doing with Grant.

02:51.977 --> 02:53.444
No, it wasn't.

02:53.478 --> 02:55.479
I like Grant, but I just like him.

02:55.514 --> 02:59.583
I'm not in love with him. And
I just felt like seeing him.

02:59.618 --> 03:02.720
Forget it. Don't tell him to call
me. He never has to call me again.

03:02.754 --> 03:05.690
He's a nice guy who needs a nice girl

03:05.724 --> 03:08.559
who's in love with him, not
in love with someone else.

03:08.593 --> 03:10.795
He needs a serious relationship.

03:10.829 --> 03:13.931
He wants a serious relationship.
He wants a girlfriend.

03:15.167 --> 03:17.935
I need a guy like that. Do
you know a guy like that?

03:22.341 --> 03:25.309
Yeah. Yeah, I know a guy like that.

03:25.344 --> 03:26.978
Set me up.

03:27.012 --> 03:28.312
The Christian girl?

03:28.347 --> 03:30.247
What's wrong with that?
I don't know, Griffin.

03:30.282 --> 03:32.249
I'd like to have sex again
sometime in this lifetime.

03:32.284 --> 03:33.451
She's had sex.

03:33.485 --> 03:35.953
How do you know? Everybody knows.

03:35.988 --> 03:39.090
Doesn't matter. I don't wanna have sex
with her. I wanna have sex with Ashley.

03:39.124 --> 03:43.995
She got on the pill to have sex
with me. Uh, no, it wasn't for you.

03:44.029 --> 03:46.197
Oh, come on. She didn't get on
the pill to have sex with Ricky.

03:46.231 --> 03:48.366
She got on the pill 'cause we
were thinking about having sex.

03:48.400 --> 03:50.001
We talked about it. No.

03:50.035 --> 03:51.335
Come on. No.

03:51.370 --> 03:54.338
Really?

03:54.373 --> 03:56.607
And you're gonna have to move on

03:56.641 --> 03:58.142
and get back out there.

03:58.176 --> 04:00.144
Getting back out there
with Grace Bowman-

04:00.178 --> 04:02.013
Hey, now, that's getting back out there.

04:02.047 --> 04:03.347
I don't even know what she looks like.

04:03.382 --> 04:06.817
Well, she's blonde, blue
eyes, cheerleader type.

04:06.852 --> 04:09.353
She actually was a cheerleader.
I'm not the cheerleader type.

04:09.388 --> 04:11.122
Here's the thing:

04:11.156 --> 04:14.658
I already told her you'd go.

04:17.596 --> 04:20.031
So all you have to do is
find a date for Griffin?

04:20.065 --> 04:21.832
Uh-huh. Do you know any gay guys?

04:21.867 --> 04:23.834
I think so. You think?

04:23.835 --> 04:27.835

04:43.782 --> 04:47.351
So, I was wondering. Would
you wanna meet someone?

04:47.386 --> 04:48.719
Go on.

04:48.754 --> 04:51.055
I mean, it's so difficult
to meet someone, right?

04:51.089 --> 04:53.057
Yeah, I guess.

04:53.091 --> 04:54.392
You know, especially at our church.

04:54.426 --> 04:56.127
The whole youth program fell apart.

04:56.161 --> 04:58.296
Yeah, I think that was partly my fault

04:58.330 --> 05:00.164
for sharing too much.

05:00.199 --> 05:03.034
I don't think parents wanted their
teens in the teen abstinence group

05:03.068 --> 05:04.735
after the whole thing with Jack.

05:04.770 --> 05:06.070
Whole thing, huh?

05:06.104 --> 05:08.739
Bad choice of words.

05:08.774 --> 05:10.474
Anyway, I was wondering if you were up

05:10.509 --> 05:12.743
for a double date tonight with
a really good friend of mine.

05:13.946 --> 05:15.413
Why not?

05:15.447 --> 05:16.914
Should I just come over to your house,

05:16.949 --> 05:18.382
and then we'll go off from there?

05:18.417 --> 05:20.284
That's perfect. It's a school night,

05:20.319 --> 05:22.687
so I was thinking we could just
order pizza and stay at my house.

05:22.721 --> 05:24.755
Say around 7:00? I'll see you then.

05:30.729 --> 05:32.563
Hi, Grant.

05:32.598 --> 05:34.565
My cousin tells me we're
not going out anymore.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.567
So I just wanted to make sure
of that 'cause I'm going out

05:36.602 --> 05:39.270
with this Grace girl that
Griffin wants me to go out with.

05:39.304 --> 05:40.771
You know Grace, right?

05:40.806 --> 05:43.241
Yeah, her mother was my dad's
first wife. I know Grace.

05:43.275 --> 05:45.943
Oh, maybe I shouldn't go
if it'd be awkward for you.

05:45.978 --> 05:48.045
Oh, no. It's not awkward
for me. Not awkward at all.

05:48.080 --> 05:51.415
We're not really going out. We're
just going over to her house for pizza.

05:51.450 --> 05:53.618
Whatever. You can go out with
anyone you wanna go out with.

05:53.652 --> 05:55.453
And that's 'cause you're
in love with Ricky?

05:55.487 --> 05:57.421
I didn't say that. I never
said that. We're just friends.

05:57.456 --> 05:58.789
I thought you were just
acting like friends.

05:58.824 --> 06:00.892
Is Griffin there? He
didn't have to tell me.

06:00.926 --> 06:02.960
But he did. Big mouth.

06:02.995 --> 06:06.030
It doesn't matter. If you're in love
with Ricky, you're in love with Ricky.

06:06.064 --> 06:07.999
But if you do change your mind

06:08.033 --> 06:11.235
and you decide you're not
ilove with Ricky, let me know.

06:11.270 --> 06:13.504
I never said I was in love with Ricky.

06:13.538 --> 06:16.040
I have a relationship with you, and
I have a relationship with Ricky,

06:16.074 --> 06:19.977
and my relationship with you has nothing
to do with my relationship with him, and...

06:20.012 --> 06:21.979
And it's really none of your business,

06:22.014 --> 06:23.781
and I don't wanna talk about
this anymore, all right?

06:23.815 --> 06:25.783
All right. But, Ashley,
I can't make you love me

06:25.817 --> 06:27.785
just like you can't make Ricky love you.

06:27.819 --> 06:30.721
That's just the way it is. Yeah,
I guess that's the way it is.

06:30.756 --> 06:33.124
Or isn't. You don't know, and
neither does your stupid cousin.

06:33.158 --> 06:35.126
Okay, I don't know.

06:35.160 --> 06:38.062
But thanks for taking my call.

06:38.096 --> 06:40.598
See you at school next year. Oh,
you're not still transferring?

06:40.632 --> 06:43.267
That's the plan. I signed
up for the chess team.

06:43.302 --> 06:45.036
You play chess? Yeah.

06:45.070 --> 06:49.173
I've won a few tournaments.
Nothing big, but I play.

06:49.207 --> 06:51.809
I'm also a competitive
skier, and I play baseball.

06:51.843 --> 06:55.279
All things you'd know if we hadn't spent
all our time talking about you and Ricky.

06:55.314 --> 06:56.814
Speaking of which, I'm
a very good listener.

06:56.848 --> 06:58.449
All right. Well, good
luck with all that.

06:58.483 --> 07:02.386
Oh, one more thing I wanted to ask you.

07:02.421 --> 07:05.957
When you got on the pill, was it
because you thought we'd have sex,

07:05.991 --> 07:07.992
or because you thought
you'd have sex with Ricky?

07:10.028 --> 07:12.697
Yeah, that's what Griffin said.

07:13.699 --> 07:15.666
Bye, Ashley.

07:20.672 --> 07:22.840
Hey. Your mother and I

07:22.874 --> 07:25.276
are taking Robie for his checkup, and
then we're gonna grab some dinner together.

07:25.310 --> 07:27.311
We're trying to make up our date
that got screwed up last weekend.

07:27.346 --> 07:30.114
You're going to a doctor's appointment,
then you're taking Robie with you to dinner?

07:30.148 --> 07:32.383
Yeah. What the heck. The two of
us never just go out with our son.

07:32.417 --> 07:34.719
You think he knows that? We know that.

07:34.753 --> 07:37.121
So I'm leaving you alone with
Ricky in the house. You know why?

07:37.155 --> 07:38.289
No, I don't know why.

07:38.323 --> 07:40.324
Because I can trust you,
and I can trust Ricky,

07:40.359 --> 07:41.993
so behave yourself.

07:42.027 --> 07:43.995
Your mother left you a
casserole. It's in the oven.

07:44.029 --> 07:46.330
It'll be ready in an hour. There's
a salad in the refrigerator.

07:46.365 --> 07:47.898
That's my contribution
- the salad.

07:47.933 --> 07:50.167
All you have to do is take the
food and put it on the table

07:50.202 --> 07:52.203
and take it off the table,
clean up or help Ricky clean up.

07:52.237 --> 07:54.839
I'll just eat in my room. I thought you two were friends again
- you and Ricky.

07:54.873 --> 07:56.340
We're friends again, yeah.

07:56.375 --> 07:58.342
But that doesn't mean I
wanna have dinner with him.

07:58.377 --> 07:59.877
It means I don't have
to have dinner with him.

07:59.911 --> 08:02.580
All right. He wants to have
dinner with you. He does?

08:02.614 --> 08:05.249
Yeah. He told me it'd be a good chance
for you two to hang out and talk.

08:05.283 --> 08:07.318
About what? I don't know.
Whatever you two talk about.

08:07.352 --> 08:08.853
Yeah. Sure. Whatever.

08:08.887 --> 08:10.955
"Whatever. " It's music to my ears.

08:10.989 --> 08:12.323
Good-bye, my sweetie pie.

08:12.357 --> 08:13.524
Bye.

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:25.203 --> 08:27.905
Because her father asked me
to speak to her, that's why.

08:27.939 --> 08:30.207
And I don't need your permission
to speak to Adrian, Ben.

08:30.242 --> 08:32.143
I'm just letting you know
that I'm speaking to her.

08:32.177 --> 08:33.778
What, you in love with Adrian now?

08:33.812 --> 08:36.080
No, I'm not in love with Adrian,
but she is having my baby.

08:36.114 --> 08:38.749
And? And she needs to
concentrate on the baby.

08:38.784 --> 08:40.251
She can concentrate on the baby

08:40.284 --> 08:41.751
and still have a conversation with me.

08:41.787 --> 08:43.854
I just don't think she
needs to have a conversation

08:43.889 --> 08:45.723
with you right now, or have sex.

08:45.757 --> 08:47.058
Have sex with Adrian.

08:47.092 --> 08:48.559
I'm never having sex with Adrian again.

08:48.593 --> 08:50.127
Oh, you're gonna talk to Adrian,

08:50.162 --> 08:51.962
but you're never having
sex with Adrian again?

08:51.997 --> 08:55.099
Oh, please. If you're
talking, you're sexing.

08:55.133 --> 08:56.934
I mean, when did you two ever just talk?

08:56.968 --> 08:59.403
You don't know anything about our
relationship. Oh, I know plenty.

08:59.438 --> 09:02.273
And, you know, we talked. We talked
a lot. We went to therapy together.

09:02.307 --> 09:05.509
Yeah, and afterwards, you two
had the best sex you've ever had.

09:05.544 --> 09:08.446
That's what she told me. So I don't
think you need to be talking to her.

09:08.480 --> 09:11.348
And I'm gonna talk to Ruben and tell him
that you're not gonna be talking to her,

09:11.383 --> 09:14.051
because something like that might
happen again. Something like what?

09:14.086 --> 09:16.787
Something like you talk to her,
and then you have sex with her.

09:16.822 --> 09:19.156
You can't have sex with her
- not while she's having my baby.

09:19.191 --> 09:22.026
And if you don't wanna explain that
to Ruben, I'll explain that to Ruben.

09:22.060 --> 09:24.762
No, you won't, because I'm gonna talk
to her just like Ruben asked me to do.

09:24.796 --> 09:26.263
Yeah, well, when Ruben asked you,

09:26.298 --> 09:27.932
I don't imagine he had all the facts.

09:27.966 --> 09:30.301
I mean, do you have any idea
how much you've hurt Adrian?

09:30.335 --> 09:32.303
I've hurt Adrian? How
much I've hurt Adrian?

09:32.337 --> 09:34.572
Excuse me, but I don't think I
hurt her as much as you've hurt her,

09:34.606 --> 09:35.940
Mr. "I Don't Know How To Use A Condom. "

09:35.974 --> 09:37.942
I know how to use a condom. Do you?

09:37.976 --> 09:39.310
I know how to use a condom.

09:39.344 --> 09:40.511
Then how'd Amy get pregnant?

09:40.545 --> 09:43.514
Hey, knock it off, you two.

09:43.548 --> 09:46.217
Bunny takes off for an hour to go to
the dentist, and this is what happens?

09:46.251 --> 09:48.786
You scare off all the
customers with this nonsense.

09:48.820 --> 09:50.154
What is wrong with you?

09:50.188 --> 09:53.524
I apologize, Mr. Boykewich.
This will never happen again.

09:53.558 --> 09:55.626
He's gonna start
talking to Adrian again,

09:55.660 --> 09:57.161
and you know what that means.

09:57.195 --> 09:58.829
No, I don't know what that means.

09:58.864 --> 10:00.931
And you don't know
what that means either.

10:00.966 --> 10:02.433
Go wait in the car for me.

10:02.467 --> 10:03.834
Dad, I have a car.

10:03.869 --> 10:05.536
Oh, that's right.

10:05.570 --> 10:08.939
You're not seven. You're almost 17.

10:08.974 --> 10:11.976
Go home. I need to talk to Ricky.

10:12.010 --> 10:14.478
Are you gonna tell him
not to talk to Adrian?

10:14.513 --> 10:16.680
"Are you gonna tell him
not to talk to Adrian?"

10:16.715 --> 10:19.016
No, I'm not. Go home.

10:19.050 --> 10:21.519
All right. I'll go home.

10:32.097 --> 10:33.864
I'm really sorry.

10:33.899 --> 10:35.666
I lost my temper.

10:35.700 --> 10:38.569
I used to do stupid stuff
when I lost my temper.

10:38.603 --> 10:41.005
Now, apparently, I just say
stupid stuff when I lose my temper.

10:41.039 --> 10:43.641
Everyone loses their
temper now and then.

10:43.675 --> 10:46.210
But you and Ben
- you both need to grow up.

10:46.244 --> 10:48.012
Yes, you're right. We do.

10:48.046 --> 10:50.848
So, did you talk to Ruben?

10:50.882 --> 10:54.385
Yes. And he asked me to talk to Adrian.

10:54.419 --> 10:56.387
You know why he asked
you to talk to Adrian?

10:56.421 --> 10:58.389
Because I asked him to help my mother.

10:58.423 --> 11:01.458
But, you know, maybe Ruben
shouldn't help my mother out.

11:01.493 --> 11:02.960
Maybe you shouldn't either.

11:02.994 --> 11:04.595
What if she totally screws you over?

11:04.629 --> 11:07.097
What if she robs you blind?
What if she commits a crime,

11:07.132 --> 11:09.533
or she goes off the wagon
and overdoses or something?

11:09.568 --> 11:12.236
You're still gonna
have to talk to Adrian.

11:12.270 --> 11:15.039
Look, I know you're a man of your word,

11:15.073 --> 11:19.043
and I told that to Ruben this
afternoon when he called me.

11:19.077 --> 11:21.278
Ruben's trying to uphold
his end of the bargain.

11:21.313 --> 11:24.248
He's working on getting
your mother out of jail.

11:24.282 --> 11:27.618
And he's counting on you to keep up your
end of the bargain and talk to Adrian.

11:27.652 --> 11:29.887
I'm gonna talk to her. Tonight.

11:29.921 --> 11:32.356
I can't tonight. I have John tonight,

11:32.390 --> 11:34.358
and the Juergens are
going out to dinner,

11:34.392 --> 11:36.427
and I'm supposed to
have dinner with Ashley.

11:38.230 --> 11:39.597
You told him it'd be tonight?

11:41.466 --> 11:42.967
All right.

11:43.001 --> 11:45.436
I might as well get this
over with... tonight.

11:45.470 --> 11:48.839
Good. Good.

11:48.873 --> 11:51.275
But I think there is
something you should know.

12:03.981 --> 12:05.281
Hi there.

12:05.315 --> 12:06.782
Hello.

12:06.817 --> 12:08.718
You went to school today, right?

12:08.752 --> 12:11.287
Right. I thought so.

12:13.590 --> 12:15.224
Okay.

12:17.094 --> 12:19.128
If you wanted to get dressed,

12:19.163 --> 12:21.931
I could take us out for a quick dinner
tonight since your mom isn't here.

12:21.965 --> 12:24.967
That's okay. I'd rather eat fresh
food at home. It's better for the baby.

12:25.002 --> 12:27.303
Are those, uh, your pajamas?

12:27.337 --> 12:29.405
Yeah, I came home and took
a nap. In your pajamas.

12:29.439 --> 12:31.340
I'm comfortable, okay?

12:31.375 --> 12:34.177
I got a snack, put on my pajamas,

12:34.211 --> 12:37.046
I took a nap, and now
I'm having another snack.

12:37.080 --> 12:39.048
Then when I'm finished
studying, I'm gonna eat dinner

12:39.082 --> 12:41.150
and go to bed... in these pajamas.

12:41.185 --> 12:43.152
Okay, but, uh, don't you think

12:43.187 --> 12:45.855
it's kind of early in your
pregnancy to do the pajama thing?

12:45.889 --> 12:47.523
You've got months ahead of you.

12:47.558 --> 12:49.525
Lots of time to hang
out in your pajamas.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.961
You sure you don't wanna
clean up and go out?

12:51.995 --> 12:53.462
I don't feel like cleaning up.

12:53.497 --> 12:55.464
I feel like being comfortable.

12:55.499 --> 12:58.301
You can go out. You don't
have to babysit me, you know.

12:58.335 --> 13:00.169
I'm having a baby. I'm not a baby.

13:00.204 --> 13:03.639
It's just that sometimes when you
clean up, it makes you feel better.

13:03.674 --> 13:06.642
I feel fine. What are you lying about?

13:06.677 --> 13:08.678
Lying? I'm not lying.

13:08.712 --> 13:10.646
I'm just being subtle.

13:10.681 --> 13:12.915
Subtle about what?

13:12.950 --> 13:14.850
All right.

13:14.885 --> 13:17.153
Remember when I told you
Ricky asked me for a favor,

13:17.187 --> 13:20.089
trying to help his mother get out of
jail, and then I as+Ãd him for a favor?

13:20.123 --> 13:22.058
Yeah. You wanted him to talk to me. So?

13:22.092 --> 13:24.327
So I think he might stop by tonight.

13:24.361 --> 13:25.494
Tonight?

13:25.529 --> 13:27.430
Yes. He wants to talk.

13:27.464 --> 13:29.098
About what? About anything.

13:29.132 --> 13:31.133
Why? Because.

13:32.369 --> 13:33.970
Because I know you care about him.

13:34.004 --> 13:36.539
Cared. Past tense.

13:36.573 --> 13:38.808
Past or present, I know
it hurts your feelings

13:38.842 --> 13:40.343
that he doesn't talk to you anymore.

13:40.377 --> 13:42.612
No, it doesn't. I'm over it.

13:42.646 --> 13:44.547
Maybe you are or maybe you aren't.

13:44.581 --> 13:46.649
But there's no reason for the
two of you not to be friends.

13:46.683 --> 13:49.318
Hello. I'm pregnant,

13:49.353 --> 13:51.320
and it's not his baby.

13:51.355 --> 13:53.222
So why should we be friends?

13:53.257 --> 13:55.925
And better question, why should
you decide who I'm friends with?

13:55.959 --> 13:57.526
I'm not interested in
being friends with Ricky.

13:57.561 --> 14:00.963
Look, Adrian, until and unless
you are friends with Ricky,

14:00.998 --> 14:02.565
you're never gonna get over him.

14:02.599 --> 14:05.234
You're always gonna see him as the
guy you lost because of the baby.

14:05.269 --> 14:08.638
What? Yeah. So, if you
two could be friends,

14:08.672 --> 14:10.539
I'm sure you'll see that
he isn't the guy for you.

14:10.574 --> 14:12.141
And he never was.

14:12.175 --> 14:15.745
He's a nice guy, but he's not
the guy for you. And who is?

14:15.779 --> 14:19.548
Well, I'm sure there's another
guy who is the guy for you.

14:19.583 --> 14:21.751
You just may not see it yet.

14:21.785 --> 14:23.152
Who?

14:23.186 --> 14:24.487
Could be anyone.

14:24.521 --> 14:26.389
It could even be the
father of your baby.

14:26.423 --> 14:27.690
Ben?

14:27.724 --> 14:29.692
Could be Ben.

14:29.726 --> 14:32.395
Ben is in love with Amy.

14:32.429 --> 14:34.330
One day, he'll be friends with Amy,

14:34.364 --> 14:36.265
and he'll get over his
infatuation with her

14:36.300 --> 14:38.768
just like you'll get over
your infatuation with Ricky.

14:38.802 --> 14:40.770
Love doesn't always have
to be just about passion.

14:40.804 --> 14:42.204
It can also be about practicality.

14:42.239 --> 14:43.372
Oh, no.

14:43.407 --> 14:46.042
Would it be so horrible
if one day you marry Ben?

14:46.076 --> 14:48.711
Yes! I don't wanna marry Ben!

14:48.745 --> 14:52.348
Maybe not now. But maybe, um...

14:52.382 --> 14:54.717
Maybe before the baby comes?

14:54.751 --> 14:57.086
That'd be nice.

14:57.120 --> 14:58.821
You always wanted to have a family.

14:58.855 --> 15:00.623
Now you can have your own family.

15:00.657 --> 15:02.425
We can all be one big family.

15:02.459 --> 15:04.727
You actually want me to marry Ben.

15:04.761 --> 15:06.896
Mm-hmm.

15:06.930 --> 15:09.699
Marry her? Marry Adrian?

15:09.733 --> 15:14.103
No.

15:14.137 --> 15:17.406
I know, but you could see how he might
want that for his daughter, right?

15:17.441 --> 15:19.775
No. No, I can't. That's-

15:19.810 --> 15:22.078
That's absurd. Did you tell
him you think it's absurd?

15:22.112 --> 15:23.779
No, not really.

15:23.814 --> 15:26.048
I didn't think he was in a place
where he could hear anything other than

15:26.083 --> 15:29.218
we should all do whatever he thinks
we should do for Adrian right now.

15:29.252 --> 15:30.720
Not if it's getting married!

15:30.754 --> 15:32.888
Dad, I'm in love with
Amy. You know I love Amy.

15:32.923 --> 15:34.724
I know, I know, but-

15:34.758 --> 15:36.592
But nothing. Dad, I'm in love with Amy.

15:36.626 --> 15:39.729
You just took me to New York to try
to, um, salvage the relationship.

15:39.763 --> 15:41.864
'Cause I was trying to get
you to do the right thing

15:41.898 --> 15:43.866
just like Ruben's trying
to get you and Adrian

15:43.900 --> 15:45.735
to do what he feels
is the right thing now.

15:45.769 --> 15:47.770
Adrian and I are just friends.

15:47.804 --> 15:49.271
We don't wanna get married.

15:49.306 --> 15:51.774
Well, I think you're a
little bit more than friends.

15:51.808 --> 15:54.243
Don't you? Fine. We're
friends having a baby.

15:54.277 --> 15:56.312
And that friendship may
change, don't you think?

15:56.346 --> 15:58.147
No, I don't think!

15:58.181 --> 16:00.049
Oh, calm down, will you?

16:00.083 --> 16:03.285
I'm not saying you should marry
Adrian or you shouldn't marry Adrian.

16:03.320 --> 16:05.488
It's just that- and
you have to admit-

16:05.522 --> 16:08.190
things have changed between
you and Adrian already.

16:08.225 --> 16:10.760
For example, just today
in the butcher shop,

16:10.794 --> 16:13.429
in that argument with Ricky, you
were totally protecting Adrian.

16:13.463 --> 16:15.798
No, not Adrian, the baby
- our baby.

16:15.832 --> 16:17.867
And you know why you
were protecting the baby?

16:17.901 --> 16:21.003
I'll tell you why. Because you
care about that baby already,

16:21.037 --> 16:23.038
and you care about the baby's mother.

16:23.073 --> 16:24.907
You care about Adrian.

16:24.941 --> 16:27.843
And as the years go on, you may
care more and more about Adrian.

16:27.878 --> 16:29.011
This is a nightmare.

16:29.045 --> 16:30.980
Well, I can't disagree with you there.

16:31.014 --> 16:32.915
But you're responsible
for this nightmare,

16:32.949 --> 16:36.252
and Ruben was thinking you might
wanna do something about it.

16:36.286 --> 16:38.554
Maybe your feelings
about Amy will change.

16:38.588 --> 16:40.556
Maybe your feelings
about Adrian will change,

16:40.590 --> 16:43.659
and if they do, I guess
I just wanna let you know

16:43.693 --> 16:46.362
if you decide to honor
the mother of your child

16:46.396 --> 16:48.964
and marry her, I could live with that.

16:48.999 --> 16:51.967
Dear God, man, are you insane?

16:58.708 --> 17:00.643
Hey. What happened?

17:00.677 --> 17:02.178
What do you think?

17:02.212 --> 17:04.313
They didn't let you retake
the drug test, did they?

17:04.347 --> 17:05.815
No. I'm sorry, Tom.

17:05.848 --> 17:08.150
This worst day of my life.

17:08.185 --> 17:10.486
Hey, Tommy. Oh, no.

17:10.520 --> 17:13.622
I got three words for you: just say no.

17:13.656 --> 17:15.825
I got two words for you-

17:15.858 --> 17:16.959
Tom, no.

17:16.992 --> 17:18.694
See you, sucker.

17:22.232 --> 17:25.034
Tom? Is that you, my love?

17:28.538 --> 17:29.638
Who's that?

17:29.673 --> 17:32.141
That's my husband.

17:32.175 --> 17:33.676
I'm Richard.

17:35.545 --> 17:37.179
And you must bTom.

17:37.214 --> 17:38.514
Husband?

17:38.548 --> 17:39.849
Stay calm, Tom, okay?

17:39.883 --> 17:41.684
Just stay calm. Deep breath.

17:41.718 --> 17:44.286
Take a deep breath. Count
- Count to ten.

17:44.321 --> 17:46.455
One, five, ten.

17:46.490 --> 17:48.457
How you do this to me?

17:48.492 --> 17:50.159
You're my girlfriend.

17:50.193 --> 17:52.962
Was. Was your girlfriend.

17:54.397 --> 17:56.365
Come on, Richard.

17:56.399 --> 17:58.868
We have to get the bus.

18:04.574 --> 18:08.010
Would you hurry up? If there's
a line, we'll never make it.

18:08.044 --> 18:11.347
Wasn't that the former
Mr. and Mrs. Juergens?

18:11.381 --> 18:13.983
Who cares?

18:31.500 --> 18:34.502
I'm just gonna put him down. He fell
asleep on the way home, and now he's up.

18:34.536 --> 18:36.670
Well, you're late. Dinner's
been ready for half an hour.

18:36.705 --> 18:40.374
I didn't realize. Sorry.
I'll be right back.

18:59.428 --> 19:01.495
Can you listen out for
John? I have to do something.

19:01.530 --> 19:03.497
What do you have to do? Just something.

19:03.532 --> 19:05.766
I have to go clean up.
I wanna get a shower.

19:05.801 --> 19:08.335
Mmm. A shower. All right.

19:08.370 --> 19:10.471
You'll listen out for John? Yeah. Sure.

19:23.720 --> 19:26.950
I really hope you like Peter.

19:27.055 --> 19:29.190
He's kind of like me,
'cause he's a Christian,

19:29.224 --> 19:31.392
but he likes to have fun.

19:31.426 --> 19:33.694
What do you like to do for fun, Grant?

19:33.728 --> 19:35.663
Oh, I don't know.

19:35.697 --> 19:37.264
He's an excellent chess player.

19:37.299 --> 19:39.700
He's also a competitive
skier and swimmer.

19:39.734 --> 19:42.036
He's a pretty good dancer.
He's got great teeth.

19:42.070 --> 19:43.671
No cavities.

19:43.705 --> 19:44.672
Maybe one filling.

19:44.706 --> 19:46.841
Well, you do have very nice teeth.

19:46.875 --> 19:48.209
Thank you. So do you.

19:48.243 --> 19:49.610
Thank you.

19:49.644 --> 19:52.480
I had braces but just for a year or two.

19:52.514 --> 19:54.215
So you play chess?

19:54.249 --> 19:56.250
Yeah. You play chess?

19:56.284 --> 19:58.652
Yeah, I do. My dad taught me.

19:58.687 --> 20:03.090
And I also like to swim, and
I'm not a bad skier. No kidding.

20:03.124 --> 20:05.559
So I did pretty good, huh?

20:08.296 --> 20:11.398
Let's see how I did. I
really hope you like this guy.

20:13.802 --> 20:15.903
Me, too. She's hot.

20:15.937 --> 20:18.539
How come she doesn't have
a boyfriend? I don't know.

20:18.573 --> 20:20.875
Who'd she have sex with?
What happened to him?

20:20.909 --> 20:22.743
I'll let her tell you that.

20:27.782 --> 20:29.750
Griffin. Nice to meet you.

20:29.784 --> 20:32.753
This is Peter, and this
is Griffin's cousin Grant.

20:33.955 --> 20:35.623
Hi.

20:37.926 --> 20:40.561
Are we missing someone? What?

20:40.595 --> 20:42.763
Oops. Red flag on the plate.

20:42.797 --> 20:44.765
Are we missing anybody?

20:44.799 --> 20:46.901
No, I don't think we're missing anybody.

20:46.935 --> 20:49.904
Grace, I think maybe
Peter's trying to figure out

20:49.938 --> 20:51.405
who he's supposed to be with.

20:51.439 --> 20:53.874
Oh, you're supposed to be with Griffin,

20:53.909 --> 20:56.110
and Grant is with me,

20:56.144 --> 20:58.112
'cause Grant is straight like me,

20:58.146 --> 21:01.115
and Griffin is not, like-

21:01.149 --> 21:03.217
Well, not like me. I'm
- I'm straight.

21:03.251 --> 21:05.386
Oh.

21:07.455 --> 21:09.056
Oh.

21:09.090 --> 21:10.558
That's too bad.

21:10.592 --> 21:13.060
But, hey, we can all be friends, right?

21:13.094 --> 21:15.129
Sure.

21:15.163 --> 21:16.497
I have nothing against gay guys.

21:16.531 --> 21:18.632
I'm just
- I'm not one of them.

21:19.801 --> 21:21.135
Sorry.

21:22.337 --> 21:24.538
Well, maybe you two should just go home,

21:24.573 --> 21:26.473
and Grace and I will hang out.

21:26.508 --> 21:29.109
Oh, thanks, Grant, but I'm hungry.

21:29.144 --> 21:32.112
Yeah, me, too. Okay, well, let's, um
- let's eat.

21:32.147 --> 21:34.148
And then you two can go home.

21:34.182 --> 21:36.317
Yeah, they can.

21:37.385 --> 21:38.752
Oh.

21:50.932 --> 21:52.766
Here you go, bud.

21:52.801 --> 21:54.735
Everything's gonna be fine.

21:54.769 --> 21:56.971
Forget Tammy. There's
plenty of fish in the sea.

21:57.005 --> 21:58.872
That's not the point.

21:58.907 --> 22:00.808
Point is, she got married.

22:00.842 --> 22:03.010
And she never told me

22:03.044 --> 22:05.012
she had another boyfriend.

22:05.046 --> 22:07.982
I'm sure you didn't call her and
tell her you were proposing to Adrian.

22:08.016 --> 22:10.818
I proposed to Adrian,

22:10.852 --> 22:12.553
but I didn't marry her.

22:12.587 --> 22:14.655
Would you have told Tammy
if you were getting married?

22:14.689 --> 22:16.290
No, probably not.

22:16.324 --> 22:18.459
But I still love her. Really?

22:18.493 --> 22:21.962
No, but I don't want
anyone else to love her.

22:21.997 --> 22:24.164
First heartbreak is tough, man.

22:24.199 --> 22:26.800
As happy as I am with Madison,

22:26.835 --> 22:29.003
I still don't know if I'm over Grace.

22:29.037 --> 22:32.539
Can we just focus on me?

22:32.574 --> 22:34.508
Yeah.

22:40.148 --> 22:41.515
Finally.

22:41.549 --> 22:43.517
I'll be back. You'll be back?

22:43.551 --> 22:46.153
I have to go talk to Adrian.
You have to go talk to Adrian?

22:46.187 --> 22:48.355
Her dad asked me to go talk to her.

22:48.390 --> 22:50.090
Oh, did he? Yeah.

22:50.125 --> 22:52.092
He wants us to be friends.

22:52.127 --> 22:54.294
He thinks that she's got
a lot of pressure on her

22:54.329 --> 22:56.030
now that everyone knows she's pregnant,

22:56.064 --> 22:58.532
so he asked me to talk to her.

22:58.566 --> 23:00.701
And I guess I'll go talk to her.

23:02.103 --> 23:03.237
What?

23:06.041 --> 23:08.042
You look nice. You
going out or something?

23:09.577 --> 23:11.578
All right. Well, I'll be back.

23:11.613 --> 23:14.248
Are you planning to eat here? Oh, right.

23:14.282 --> 23:16.250
Your dad said your mom made something.

23:16.284 --> 23:19.753
Just leave me a plate in the
microwave, if you don't mind.

23:25.727 --> 23:28.562
Actually, I do mind.

23:35.203 --> 23:36.537
[knockin

23:55.023 --> 23:56.557
Hi, Adrian.

23:56.591 --> 23:57.558
Hi, Ricky.

23:57.592 --> 23:59.560
It's been a long time.

24:01.062 --> 24:03.397
Yeah, it has been.

24:18.113 --> 24:20.714
Maybe it's the baby.

24:20.749 --> 24:22.883
My dad thinks we should talk.

24:22.917 --> 24:25.219
But if you don't want to...

24:44.202 --> 24:46.170
Thank you.

24:46.204 --> 24:48.539
So, we got the license.
We got the license.

24:48.573 --> 24:50.874
Should we set a date? Nah.

24:50.909 --> 24:53.677
Let's just run off someplace
when the mood strikes us,

24:53.712 --> 24:55.779
and when we can get a babysitter,

24:55.814 --> 24:59.516
and someone to watch Ashley without
letting her know that they're watching,

24:59.551 --> 25:02.119
and someone to walk Moose,

25:02.153 --> 25:04.822
and when the house is all
clean, and the laundry's done,

25:04.856 --> 25:08.292
and the refrigerator and the
shelves are stocked with groceries.

25:08.326 --> 25:11.729
Maybe then I can feel like I can take
off a few days just to think about us.

25:11.763 --> 25:15.099
You tired of staying
home? I didn't say that.

25:15.133 --> 25:18.669
But, yes, I am tired of staying at home.

25:18.703 --> 25:21.905
But I love spending time
with this little guy.

25:21.940 --> 25:24.208
And right now, his needs are
more important than my own.

25:24.242 --> 25:27.611
True, but you're not the only
one who can meet his needs.

25:27.646 --> 25:31.215
Well, until you're more
comfortable with daycare, I am.

25:31.249 --> 25:33.617
Anyway, I don't really have
anywhere else to go yet.

25:33.652 --> 25:36.220
I'm happy you said that.

25:36.254 --> 25:39.623
I was thinking, maybe you should
start a business of your own.

25:39.658 --> 25:41.425
Really? You were thinking that?

25:41.459 --> 25:43.594
Yeah. What kind of business?

25:43.628 --> 25:46.130
Furniture business. What,
and compete with you?

25:46.164 --> 25:48.866
No. Take over for me.

25:48.900 --> 25:51.635
Take the business and turn
it into something green.

25:51.670 --> 25:54.271
Maybe recycle and repurpose and
rethink the way we do things.

25:54.305 --> 25:55.773
Like that business plan that I wrote.

25:55.807 --> 25:57.107
For your old boyfriend.

25:57.142 --> 25:59.476
So you read my business
plan? You've actually read it?

25:59.511 --> 26:02.312
You said I could read it. Okay. And?

26:02.347 --> 26:04.815
Don't get angry, all
right? Well, I'm not angry.

26:04.849 --> 26:06.784
I'm just surprised. What'd you think?

26:06.818 --> 26:08.452
I thought it was pretty good,

26:08.486 --> 26:10.721
but it's tough to tell
how plans will really work,

26:10.755 --> 26:13.424
so I kind of did a little experiment.

26:13.458 --> 26:14.758
Donovan and me-

26:14.793 --> 26:17.494
we did kind of an
Internet Web site thing

26:17.529 --> 26:19.763
as a little branch of my business,

26:19.798 --> 26:22.466
and it kind of took off.

26:22.500 --> 26:25.135
It's doing so well, I thought
maybe you should take over the store

26:25.170 --> 26:28.939
and turn the whole store into
what we're doing on the Internet.

26:28.973 --> 26:30.874
Okay. Be angry so we
can get this over with

26:30.909 --> 26:32.976
and have dinner, make up, go
home, have sex, and plan a wedding.

26:33.011 --> 26:35.045
I'm not that angry.

26:35.080 --> 26:38.382
I'm just a little annoyed
that you didn't include me,

26:38.416 --> 26:42.186
or at least tell me
sooner, but that's just you.

26:42.220 --> 26:44.121
So how well is it doing?

26:44.155 --> 26:45.189
Well.

26:45.223 --> 26:47.624
Are you serious? Yeah, I'm serious.

26:47.659 --> 26:49.827
I would love to.

26:49.861 --> 26:53.263
But I just don't know how we
could survive working together.

26:53.298 --> 26:55.599
We can barely survive
being at home together.

26:55.633 --> 26:59.169
I mean, we have, but all the time?

26:59.204 --> 27:00.504
What about Robie?

27:00.538 --> 27:02.039
If you think that all this

27:02.073 --> 27:03.707
can be done from a home
office, I seriously doubt it.

27:03.742 --> 27:05.209
Me, too.

27:05.243 --> 27:08.045
But... I could stay home.

27:08.079 --> 27:10.681
I'd love to stay home and keep house
and cook and take care of the kids.

27:10.715 --> 27:11.682
Since when?

27:11.716 --> 27:13.350
Since him.

27:14.719 --> 27:16.987
I don't know, Anne. Having
almost lost everything,

27:17.021 --> 27:20.157
I know how much it all means to me
- how much you mean to me

27:20.191 --> 27:22.226
and how little working at the
furniture store means to me.

27:22.260 --> 27:24.461
And this new business
- it's not just a furniture store,

27:24.496 --> 27:27.131
it's a project that involves some
kind of greater consciousness.

27:27.165 --> 27:28.699
A consciousness I don't have.

27:28.733 --> 27:30.868
Yes, you do.

27:32.237 --> 27:34.538
So you really think that we can do this?

27:34.572 --> 27:36.673
Make a big change like this
- the two of us?

27:36.708 --> 27:39.042
Hey, I don't just love you.

27:39.077 --> 27:41.845
We're friends. We can do anything.

27:41.880 --> 27:43.881
Even get married.

27:59.531 --> 28:02.666
Oh, geez, Amy.

28:05.103 --> 28:06.870
Hey, Ashley, are you there?

28:06.905 --> 28:08.539
Yeah, I'm here.

28:08.573 --> 28:10.240
Are you speaking to me?

28:10.275 --> 28:13.010
Yeah, I'm speaking to you.
I wanna speak to you anyway.

28:13.044 --> 28:16.413
About what? You know what.
That message you left me.

28:16.447 --> 28:18.582
Didn't you already speak
to Ricky about that?

28:18.616 --> 28:20.584
Yeah, I did speak to Ricky,

28:20.618 --> 28:22.152
'cause I thought it was probably Ricky

28:22.187 --> 28:23.887
who was the one who initiated the kiss,

28:23.922 --> 28:26.023
and I thought it was the wrong thing to do
- to kiss you.

28:27.625 --> 28:29.893
But you were the one who kissed him.

28:29.928 --> 28:31.628
Or the one who initiated it anyway.

28:31.663 --> 28:32.963
Yeah. And?

28:32.997 --> 28:36.533
And... Ricky said it was really a kiss-

28:36.568 --> 28:38.268
a nice, long kiss.

28:38.303 --> 28:41.672
Gave you all the details, huh?

28:41.706 --> 28:44.408
I really didn't think he
was the kiss-and-tell type.

28:44.442 --> 28:47.077
I pressured him to give me
the details. I wanted to know.

28:47.111 --> 28:49.546
Why? I don't know.

28:49.581 --> 28:53.517
'Cause
- 'Cause you're my sister.

28:53.551 --> 28:55.452
You always thought he was cute.

28:55.486 --> 28:57.154
You were always attracted to him,

28:57.188 --> 28:59.156
and I always knew that
you two would get around

28:59.190 --> 29:01.525
to kissing each other one day.

29:01.559 --> 29:03.894
I just didn't know it
would be this soon, I guess.

29:03.928 --> 29:05.963
I thought it would be
after I found someone,

29:05.997 --> 29:08.765
and after I was in love,
and after I didn't care.

29:08.800 --> 29:10.434
So you care?

29:10.468 --> 29:11.935
I don't know.

29:11.970 --> 29:13.503
I don't know if I care.

29:13.538 --> 29:15.372
Maybe I care a little bit.

29:15.406 --> 29:17.941
I don't want my little sister
stealing the guy I had a baby with,

29:17.976 --> 29:19.743
even if I was only
with him the one time.

29:19.777 --> 29:21.311
Makes me feel like a loser.

29:21.346 --> 29:24.948
Wait. When did you start talking
like a real person, telling the truth?

29:24.983 --> 29:27.184
Since I...

29:27.218 --> 29:29.119
Okay, you promise not to tell?

29:29.153 --> 29:30.687
Promise not to tell what?

29:30.722 --> 29:32.322
That I'm giving up the French horn.

29:32.357 --> 29:34.791
Aren't you there for a music program?

29:34.826 --> 29:36.860
Aren't you there so you
can go to Juilliard someday?

29:36.895 --> 29:38.362
Well, that's why I came here.

29:38.396 --> 29:40.130
But you wanna know
something really funny?

29:40.164 --> 29:42.866
Yeah, I would love to
know something funny.

29:44.702 --> 29:47.170
I'm not very good at
playing the French horn.

29:47.205 --> 29:49.706
I knew that. I've heard you play.

29:49.741 --> 29:50.874
<i>Ashley!</i>

29:50.909 --> 29:53.043
I'm just joking, kind of.

29:53.077 --> 29:55.612
I'll have you know I'm
good. I'm very good.

29:55.647 --> 29:59.116
I'm just not good enough.
I'll never be good enough.

29:59.150 --> 30:01.852
I just didn't start early enough
or compete in big enough circles.

30:01.886 --> 30:03.787
Well, you're a junior next year.

30:03.821 --> 30:05.188
You've still got time to improve.

30:05.223 --> 30:07.691
Maybe. I don't know if I want to.

30:07.725 --> 30:10.560
I've been dragging around that
French horn for ten years now,

30:10.595 --> 30:12.562
and I only did it to please Mom.

30:12.597 --> 30:14.531
I thought she really
loved the French horn.

30:14.565 --> 30:16.033
And you know what? I don't.

30:16.067 --> 30:18.035
And that's so freeing, Ashley-

30:18.069 --> 30:20.037
to give up one dream and
start dreaming something else.

30:20.071 --> 30:21.338
You mean like Ricky?

30:21.372 --> 30:23.874
Maybe we both should give him up.

30:23.908 --> 30:27.010
Well, I think we're gonna
have to. He's over at Adrian's.

30:27.045 --> 30:28.512
Is he?

30:28.546 --> 30:32.082
Oh. Well, it's okay, I guess.

30:32.116 --> 30:34.418
I talked to her last week. I called her.

30:34.452 --> 30:36.420
We had a really nice conversation.

30:36.454 --> 30:38.355
You didn't start drinking
at that school, did you?

30:38.389 --> 30:40.324
No, I didn't.

30:40.358 --> 30:42.025
Don't go all mature on me now, okay?

30:42.060 --> 30:43.193
Okay.

30:44.529 --> 30:45.896
You okay, Ashley?

30:46.931 --> 30:49.299
Yeah, I'm okay.

30:49.334 --> 30:52.836
I guess sometimes your sister will
tell you things even your friends won't.

30:52.870 --> 30:55.339
So how are you friends?

30:55.373 --> 30:57.474
You mean my friend,

30:57.508 --> 31:00.043
Griffin?

31:00.078 --> 31:03.847
Um, Grace set him up with some guy.

31:03.881 --> 31:05.682
Grace knows a guy for Griffin?

31:07.552 --> 31:09.519
I should probably go, too.

31:09.554 --> 31:11.521
You don't have to. Actually, I do.

31:11.556 --> 31:13.690
Griffin's riding with me.
I gave him a ride over here.

31:13.725 --> 31:15.392
Oh. I didn't realize.

31:15.426 --> 31:18.295
Yeah. So he's probably
waiting in the car.

31:18.329 --> 31:20.664
But he can wait a few more minutes.

31:20.698 --> 31:24.334
Well, um, I had a really nice time.

31:24.369 --> 31:26.370
It was really nice meeting you.

31:26.404 --> 31:28.005
Yeah. It was nice meeting you, too.

31:32.477 --> 31:35.412
Oh. Hey, I didn't know you had company.

31:35.446 --> 31:37.814
I was just getting something for Tom.

31:39.017 --> 31:40.517
Jack. Grant.

31:40.551 --> 31:42.152
This is Jack.

31:42.186 --> 31:44.721
He's my brother's roommate.
He lives in our guest house.

31:44.756 --> 31:47.858
Oh. What do you need?

31:47.892 --> 31:50.560
Tom found out Tammy got
married, and he's kind of upset.

31:50.595 --> 31:52.195
I didn't know he still cared for Tammy.

31:52.230 --> 31:53.864
Yeah, well, you know how that is.

32:08.713 --> 32:10.781
How long you think he'll stick around?

32:10.815 --> 32:13.650
The longer the better.
I don't mind waiting.

32:13.684 --> 32:15.652
I'd love it if Grace is interested him,

32:15.686 --> 32:17.320
and he's interested in her.

32:17.355 --> 32:20.157
They're both nice people. Yeah.

32:20.191 --> 32:22.159
Yeah, I'd love it if
Grace were interested in me

32:22.193 --> 32:25.362
and I were interested in her, too.

32:29.567 --> 32:33.136
Hey, uh, thanks for not saying anything.

32:34.138 --> 32:35.639
I don't know anything.

32:35.673 --> 32:38.442
I know you recognize me.

32:39.444 --> 32:41.078
I recognize you.

32:41.112 --> 32:43.113
I see you at Ed's on Thursday nights.

32:43.147 --> 32:44.614
Gay nights?

32:44.649 --> 32:46.116
You're at Ed's on gay nights?

32:46.150 --> 32:47.918
I
- I didn't know.

32:47.952 --> 32:49.619
You knew.

32:49.654 --> 32:51.922
So what? That doesn't mean you're gay.

32:51.956 --> 32:54.424
Guys who aren't gay

32:54.459 --> 32:56.760
come in with friends,
I guess, sometimes.

32:56.794 --> 32:58.495
Well, I can't come out.

32:58.529 --> 33:00.430
I can't. It would kill my father.

33:00.465 --> 33:01.765
He could surprise you.

33:01.799 --> 33:03.633
No.

33:03.668 --> 33:05.635
No. Believe me,

33:05.670 --> 33:08.538
I'd be the one surprising him.

33:08.573 --> 33:10.407
I can't
- I can't do it.

33:11.676 --> 33:14.411
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

33:14.445 --> 33:16.546
You know, I'm sure it's, uh-

33:16.581 --> 33:18.215
I'm sure that's really painful.

33:18.249 --> 33:19.749
Yeah.

33:19.784 --> 33:21.551
I can't help you.

33:21.586 --> 33:23.553
I mean, I don't know what to say.

33:23.588 --> 33:26.990
You should probably talk to a counselor.

33:27.024 --> 33:28.925
Oh, you know, I could do that.

33:28.960 --> 33:31.328
I could give you the name
of a counselor to talk to.

33:31.362 --> 33:33.730
I know someone. All right.

33:33.764 --> 33:36.700
Yeah, I
- I guess that might help.

33:36.734 --> 33:39.603
I don't know.

33:39.637 --> 33:41.271
How'd she know?

33:42.440 --> 33:44.941
How did Grace know? What
made her think I was gay?

33:44.976 --> 33:48.278
I have no idea. Strong gaydar?

33:49.714 --> 33:51.414
Yeah, whatever. It...

33:52.683 --> 33:55.452
It was really nice meeting you.

33:57.488 --> 33:59.623
And I, uh,

33:59.657 --> 34:01.658
hope I get to see you again.

34:03.528 --> 34:05.695
All right. Well, uh,

34:05.730 --> 34:07.464
if you ever come out

34:07.498 --> 34:11.168
and want to go out, give me a call.

34:25.248 --> 34:27.449
And that's as much time as
you could get alone with her?

34:27.485 --> 34:30.654
I tried. Some guy who lives
in the guest house camen, so...

34:30.688 --> 34:32.956
I wasn't gonna wait around all
night just to try to kiss her.

34:32.989 --> 34:34.757
But you want to kiss her.

34:34.792 --> 34:36.793
I might wanna kiss her.

34:36.827 --> 34:38.328
She's kissable.

34:38.362 --> 34:39.963
What guy in the guest house?

34:39.996 --> 34:41.297
Jack.

34:42.500 --> 34:44.301
Aw, no. Really?

34:48.505 --> 34:50.407
So I'll say good night now.

34:50.440 --> 34:52.742
Oh, now that you've run my
date off, you'll say good night?

34:52.777 --> 34:54.244
Yeah. Pretty much.

34:54.277 --> 34:56.646
You interested in that
guy? Who wants to know?

34:56.681 --> 34:58.615
I do. I just was wondering
if you're interested.

34:58.649 --> 35:00.684
Because you're still interested in me?

35:00.718 --> 35:02.686
I'm in love with Madison.

35:02.720 --> 35:06.189
But, uh, yeah, I think I'm
always gonna be interested in you.

35:34.940 --> 35:36.774
It's not that late.

35:36.808 --> 35:39.377
I mean, I did all my homework
and everything before I left.

35:39.411 --> 35:40.978
Yeah, I figured.

35:41.013 --> 35:43.180
It's not like you have any
problem with school or anything.

35:43.215 --> 35:45.783
No. No, I don't.

35:47.352 --> 35:50.521
Is... everything okay?

35:50.555 --> 35:54.959
Yeah. Yeah, e-
e-everything is fine.

35:54.993 --> 35:57.328
All right.

35:57.362 --> 36:00.431
Well, uh,

36:00.465 --> 36:01.799
night, Dad.

36:01.833 --> 36:03.501
Good night.

36:05.037 --> 36:07.438
I
- It's just I wanted to ask you how, uh,

36:07.472 --> 36:10.708
everything went
tonight over at Grace's-

36:10.742 --> 36:13.144
meeting her friend and all.

36:13.178 --> 36:15.079
Oh...

36:15.113 --> 36:17.581
It went fine.

36:18.950 --> 36:20.818
So, you gonna be, uh,

36:20.852 --> 36:22.787
going out with him again?

36:24.189 --> 36:25.856
I'm sorry?

36:25.891 --> 36:28.159
D
- Did you like this guy

36:28.193 --> 36:30.161
that Grace introduced you to?

36:30.195 --> 36:33.030
Was
- Was he a nice guy?

36:33.065 --> 36:35.232
Because your mother and I

36:35.267 --> 36:37.968
just want you to be happy.

36:38.003 --> 36:41.439
And
- And if you like guys

36:41.473 --> 36:45.543
and dating guys makes you happy,

36:45.577 --> 36:47.345
that's fine with us.

36:47.379 --> 36:51.082
We don't want you to feel like
you have anything to hide from us.

36:54.986 --> 36:56.921
Am I in the right house?

36:56.955 --> 36:59.790
You
- Yes.

36:59.825 --> 37:03.661
Yes, you're in the right
house with the right parents.

37:04.730 --> 37:07.865
You're with the right family.

37:07.899 --> 37:10.034
We love you, son,

37:10.068 --> 37:12.737
and we don't care

37:12.771 --> 37:16.774
if you're straight or not straight.

37:16.808 --> 37:19.410
We just want you to have a good life

37:19.444 --> 37:21.879
and be a good person.

37:21.913 --> 37:26.050
You know, make a
contribution to the world.

37:26.084 --> 37:28.386
We don't care about
any of that other stuff.

37:28.420 --> 37:30.488
Are you serious?

37:32.090 --> 37:33.824
You've known all along?

37:33.859 --> 37:35.860
You and Mom have been discussing this?

37:35.894 --> 37:38.462
Yeah. We kind of figured it out

37:38.497 --> 37:40.364
along the way.

37:40.399 --> 37:42.767
I don't know.

37:42.801 --> 37:45.836
And by the way, son, it wasn't me.

37:45.871 --> 37:48.806
It was your mom that suggested to Grace

37:48.840 --> 37:53.077
if she knew a
- a guy for you to...

37:55.814 --> 37:59.083
I'll leave you alone.

37:59.117 --> 38:01.485
See you in the morning.

38:15.133 --> 38:16.734
Hello?

38:16.768 --> 38:18.102
My mom outed me?

38:18.136 --> 38:20.704
Not really, 'cause
clearly, she was mistaken.

38:20.739 --> 38:22.573
Parents. What are you gonna do?

38:22.607 --> 38:23.908
Yeah.

38:23.942 --> 38:26.610
What are you gonna do?

38:27.779 --> 38:29.580
Grace, I'm gay.

38:29.614 --> 38:31.749
You are or you aren't.
It doesn't matter to me.

38:31.783 --> 38:35.252
No. No, no. Um, I am.

38:36.788 --> 38:39.056
And I wanted to thank you
for introducing me to Griffin.

38:43.862 --> 38:46.430
Quiet. You don't wanna wake up John.

38:51.303 --> 38:54.572
Why is there a candle on the table?

38:54.606 --> 38:56.941
He better not be starting
up with her again.

38:56.975 --> 38:59.343
They're supposed to be friends.

39:04.516 --> 39:07.218
Does he know what "friend" means?

39:10.956 --> 39:13.090
Is he in there? Is she in there?

39:16.127 --> 39:17.962
I was in the nursery with John.

39:17.996 --> 39:19.897
Ricky's over at Adrian's.

39:19.931 --> 39:21.732
Geez, we're just friends. Good night.

39:21.766 --> 39:24.502
Night. Good night, Ashley.

39:24.536 --> 39:26.070
Adrian's?

39:28.073 --> 39:30.441
Better get some sleep.

39:30.475 --> 39:32.710
I took a nap this afternoon, remember?

39:32.744 --> 39:37.648
And... it's 10:00, and I'm tired.

39:37.682 --> 39:40.451
I can't believe it's
10:00 and I'm tired.

39:40.485 --> 39:43.187
But it was really nice
talking to you, and...

39:43.221 --> 39:45.856
Hey, I can stay up a little
longer if you wanna talk some more.

39:45.891 --> 39:47.558
No, that's okay.

39:47.592 --> 39:49.326
And besides, I've been here for hours,

39:49.361 --> 39:51.228
and this is gonna make Ben crazy.

39:51.263 --> 39:55.199
I don't think this is
gonna make Ben crazy.

39:55.233 --> 39:57.701
My dad pushing Ben to marry
me is gonna make Ben crazy.

39:57.736 --> 40:00.804
Yeah. That's... interesting.

40:00.839 --> 40:02.673
But you're not-

40:02.707 --> 40:04.008
Oh, no. I'm not.

40:04.042 --> 40:07.111
Well, anyway, Ben didn't
want me to talk to you.

40:07.145 --> 40:09.980
He thought if I talked to
you, we'd end up, you know.

40:10.015 --> 40:12.516
Yeah, I know.

40:12.551 --> 40:14.818
But I don't think that's
ever gonna happen again.

40:14.853 --> 40:17.555
I've given up on what
can ever happen again.

40:22.394 --> 40:23.928
It's Ben.

40:23.962 --> 40:26.063
Take it. I'm leaving.

40:26.097 --> 40:27.731
Good night.

40:35.373 --> 40:36.874
Hello, Ben.

40:36.908 --> 40:38.242
Hello, Adrian.

40:38.276 --> 40:40.044
Don't worry. I don't
wanna get married either.

40:40.078 --> 40:42.379
It's not that I didn't
wanna marry you, Adrian.

40:42.414 --> 40:44.081
It's just that,

40:44.115 --> 40:46.083
I am still hoping that Amy and I

40:46.117 --> 40:47.918
can somehow, someway get back together.

40:47.953 --> 40:50.321
But even if you two
don't get back together,

40:50.355 --> 40:52.523
I don't wanna get married, Ben.

40:52.557 --> 40:55.593
So just don't pay attention
to what my father says to you

40:55.627 --> 40:58.095
or to your father or to
Ricky or to anyone else.

40:58.129 --> 41:00.264
Did you talk to Ricky?

41:00.298 --> 41:01.365
Yes, I talked to Ricky.

41:01.399 --> 41:03.500
I knew it. Why do you care?

41:03.535 --> 41:07.805
I care because... you're having my baby.

41:07.839 --> 41:10.441
It's our baby
- mine and yours.

41:10.475 --> 41:13.410
And... I just don't want you with Ricky.

41:13.445 --> 41:15.746
I kissed him, okay?

41:15.780 --> 41:18.115
I kissed him, and he kissed me.

41:18.149 --> 41:20.618
And you know what? We ft nothing.

41:20.652 --> 41:22.620
It's over between us.

41:22.654 --> 41:24.655
Between Ricky and me.

41:24.689 --> 41:27.358
And... I think Ricky

41:27.392 --> 41:30.561
is finally in a place where
he can be friends with a woman-

41:30.595 --> 41:33.163
with me, with Ashley, with whoever.

41:33.198 --> 41:34.498
Just friends.

41:34.532 --> 41:35.933
I don't know about that, Adrian.

41:35.967 --> 41:38.202
I know. All right.

41:38.236 --> 41:41.171
And, um, I just wanted
to say good night.

41:41.206 --> 41:42.706
Good night.

41:42.741 --> 41:44.508
I like you a lot, Adrian.

41:44.542 --> 41:46.510
I like you a lot, too, Ben.

41:55.487 --> 41:57.280
Sorry, but...

41:58.472 --> 42:00.338
I might still love Ricky.
