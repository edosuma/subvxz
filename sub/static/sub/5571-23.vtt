00:00.001 --> 00:02.735
<i> Previously on</i> NCIS...

00:02.737 --> 00:04.737
Jacob Scott, former MI6,

00:04.739 --> 00:07.006
caught selling
U.S. nuclear intel to Russia.

00:07.008 --> 00:09.742
At MI6, he functioned at the
highest level of security,

00:09.744 --> 00:13.045
until we got a tip
from the CIA.

00:13.047 --> 00:14.213
Jacob Scott's out for blood.

00:14.215 --> 00:16.148
Yeah? Whose?
He said NCIS

00:16.150 --> 00:17.216
<i> killed his wife.</i>

00:17.218 --> 00:18.550
The stolen file--
put it up.

00:18.552 --> 00:19.752
Boss, this is a hit list?

00:19.754 --> 00:21.254
Where would
he start, Gibbs?
The top.

00:21.255 --> 00:22.755
Fornell:<i> The man who ordered</i>
<i> the whole damn thing--</i>

00:22.757 --> 00:24.123
<i> tom morrow.</i>

00:24.125 --> 00:25.324
No.

00:25.326 --> 00:26.458
What's that?

00:30.331 --> 00:32.131
(Phone ringing)

00:32.133 --> 00:33.032
(Silenced gunshot)

00:33.034 --> 00:34.533
(Ringing continues)

00:37.038 --> 00:38.570
Woman: Sir, you can't
go in there.
No, I'm going in!

00:38.572 --> 00:39.705
Sir!

00:42.810 --> 00:44.777
EMT: Pulse is erratic.
Blood pressure's dropping.

00:44.779 --> 00:46.345
Gibbs: Tobias, can you hear me?
Nurse: 30 ccs of etomidate.

00:46.347 --> 00:48.814
A hundred of Succinylcholine.
Prep him for surgery.

00:48.816 --> 00:50.582
Is he going to be okay?
He lost a lot of blood.

00:50.584 --> 00:51.583
We'll do what we can.
Wait, wait.

00:51.585 --> 00:53.185
I have a friend, Dr. cyril taft.

00:53.187 --> 00:54.476
He's out of the
country right now,

00:54.477 --> 00:55.766
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
But maybe he can help.

00:55.767 --> 00:57.056
You'll... you need
to prepare yourself.

00:58.492 --> 00:59.525
Prepare myself?

00:59.527 --> 01:01.393
For what?

01:01.395 --> 01:03.062
Hey.

01:03.064 --> 01:04.396
Give me a sitrep.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.131
Former MI6 chief terdei's
body's been secured.

01:06.133 --> 01:07.666
Got a bolo out on Jacob Scott

01:07.668 --> 01:09.301
over the entire
tri-state area.
Where's DiNozzo?

01:09.303 --> 01:10.602
McGee: He just got
back from Russia.

01:10.604 --> 01:11.670
He's on his way
from the airport.

01:11.672 --> 01:13.172
How's fornell?

01:13.173 --> 01:14.673
(Sighs)
We need to find his daughter.

01:14.675 --> 01:15.507
Tony:
I got her.

01:15.509 --> 01:17.176
She's still in school.

01:17.178 --> 01:18.628
Agents are bringing her in now,

01:18.629 --> 01:20.079
but, uh, she doesn't know
anything yet.

01:20.081 --> 01:22.247
She just lost one parent,
she can't lose another.

01:22.249 --> 01:23.682
Gibbs: You and that
MI6 officer Reeves

01:23.684 --> 01:25.484
were tracking Scott in Moscow.

01:25.485 --> 01:27.285
What the hell happened?
Just never got a lock on him.

01:27.288 --> 01:29.354
Jacob must've slipped back
into the states somehow.

01:29.356 --> 01:30.689
What's our next move, boss?

01:30.691 --> 01:32.491
We're gonna find Jacob Scott.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.359
And we're gonna kill him.

01:34.361 --> 01:36.428
¶ ¶

02:09.230 --> 02:10.896
boss, pulled a fingerprint
off the back window.

02:10.898 --> 02:14.433
Jacob Scott was here.

02:14.435 --> 02:17.302
I talked to a colleague
at the hospital.

02:17.304 --> 02:19.872
Fornell is still in surgery.

02:19.874 --> 02:21.306
How's he doing?

02:21.308 --> 02:22.774
Well, I wish I had good news.

02:22.776 --> 02:24.243
The best I can offer is

02:24.245 --> 02:27.279
to say that a lesser man
would be dead already.

02:27.281 --> 02:29.181
He's putting up
one hell of a fight.

02:29.183 --> 02:31.150
Ducky: Well, what
exactly happened?

02:31.152 --> 02:33.385
Fornell took three shots,

02:33.387 --> 02:35.287
landed on the coffee table here,

02:35.289 --> 02:36.889
and reached for
his cell phone here

02:36.891 --> 02:38.790
before losing consciousness.

02:38.792 --> 02:40.259
Emily:
Out of my way!

02:40.261 --> 02:41.760
This is my uncle's house!

02:41.762 --> 02:43.278
Mr. Palmer.

02:43.279 --> 02:44.795
Emily: Gibbs, tell this
stuffed suit to back off,

02:44.798 --> 02:46.732
before I scratch his eyes out.

02:46.734 --> 02:49.268
Let her in.
Yes, sir.

02:49.270 --> 02:50.335
(Emily sobs)

02:52.306 --> 02:55.541
(Sobbing)

02:59.580 --> 03:00.879
Okay.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.955
You know who did this?

03:12.893 --> 03:15.327
You're going get him, right?

03:15.329 --> 03:16.929
We won't stop until we do.

03:16.931 --> 03:17.863
Emily:
When you find him,

03:17.865 --> 03:19.765
I want you to hurt him

03:19.767 --> 03:21.567
as bad as he hurt my dad.

03:21.569 --> 03:23.936
Emily, that's not
gonna help your dad.

03:23.938 --> 03:26.205
Just promise me that
you'll make this guy pay.

03:26.207 --> 03:27.239
(Phone ringing)

03:27.241 --> 03:28.974
McGee:
Special agent McGee.

03:28.976 --> 03:31.910
He's not gonna have a good week.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.879
Glad we understand each other.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.314
McGee:
Boss,

03:35.316 --> 03:36.515
director Vance just called.

03:36.517 --> 03:38.217
He needs to see you.
Says it's urgent.

03:40.688 --> 03:41.820
What are you still doing here?

03:42.856 --> 03:44.389
DiNozzo, take the scene.

03:48.429 --> 03:50.262
Vance:
Gibbs.

03:50.264 --> 03:51.697
This FBI special agent
Tess Monroe.

03:51.699 --> 03:52.931
She was working
with agent fornell

03:52.933 --> 03:54.600
on their side
of the Jacob Scott case.

03:54.602 --> 03:55.934
Agent Monroe.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.936
Heard a a lot about you
from agent fornell.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.871
I was kind of expecting
fangs to be honest.

03:59.873 --> 04:01.640
Vance: With fornell
out of commission,

04:01.642 --> 04:03.475
agent Monroe will be
taking the point for FBI.

04:03.477 --> 04:04.610
You said this was urgent.

04:04.612 --> 04:06.979
Monroe:
Good.

04:06.981 --> 04:09.014
Not a fan
of small talk either.

04:09.016 --> 04:11.016
Former MI6 officer,

04:11.018 --> 04:12.651
Jacob Scott was arrested

04:12.653 --> 04:14.653
for selling classified NCIS data

04:14.655 --> 04:16.355
to the Russians in 2002.

04:16.357 --> 04:18.657
NCIS and MI6
then tried to have

04:18.659 --> 04:20.525
Jacob's buyer arrested.

04:20.527 --> 04:22.361
Aka nika razin,

04:22.363 --> 04:23.895
his wife.

04:23.897 --> 04:25.664
Vance: But someone tipped off
the Russians,

04:25.666 --> 04:28.033
and they took her out
before we could get to her.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.635
Jacob blames us for her death.

04:29.637 --> 04:30.986
I'm aware.

04:30.987 --> 04:32.336
Vance: Everyone who
worked on his wife's op

04:32.339 --> 04:33.505
is a potential target.

04:33.507 --> 04:34.873
I noticed.

04:34.875 --> 04:37.009
Jacob's already killed
former director morrow,

04:37.011 --> 04:38.910
MI6 chief terdei.

04:38.912 --> 04:41.346
FBI's rounding up
the remaining targets,

04:41.348 --> 04:43.015
putting them
in protective custody.

04:43.017 --> 04:44.416
But there's two
we haven't found.

04:44.418 --> 04:46.318
They were partners.
They worked out of

04:46.320 --> 04:48.987
NCIS's national security
directorate division.

04:48.989 --> 04:50.389
They're spies.

04:50.391 --> 04:52.024
Vance: Like most ex-spies,
once they retired

04:52.026 --> 04:54.293
they went off the grid.
We're up the creek with Jacob

04:54.295 --> 04:55.394
in racing for the paddle.

04:55.396 --> 04:56.662
If he finds these two
before we do,

04:56.664 --> 04:57.896
they're dead meat.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.765
Vance: And once Jacob
gets his revenge,

04:59.767 --> 05:01.400
he could disappear forever.

05:01.402 --> 05:03.435
And then we won't have ours.

05:14.581 --> 05:16.231
Sitrep.
Tony:
Yeah, boss.

05:16.232 --> 05:17.882
FBI just sent over their
files on the missing agents.

05:17.885 --> 05:20.018
We already did some groundwork

05:20.020 --> 05:21.386
using our own
personnel records.

05:21.388 --> 05:22.888
Bishop:
We located the ex-wife

05:22.889 --> 05:24.389
of former NCIS special agent
Kevin dresser.

05:24.391 --> 05:25.991
Where is she?

05:29.096 --> 05:31.663
In the conference room
with agent Monroe.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.098
Bishop:
We told her

05:33.100 --> 05:35.033
to wait for you to get back
from the Pentagon, but...

05:35.035 --> 05:36.401
But what?

05:36.403 --> 05:37.569
Well, boss, you know
that thing you do

05:37.571 --> 05:39.488
where you-your stare at us,

05:39.489 --> 05:41.406
and, uh,
it's kind of scary, like...

05:41.408 --> 05:42.541
Like you're doing now?

05:42.543 --> 05:44.076
She's also, uh,
very good at that.

05:46.380 --> 05:49.381
Monroe: My second husband
was the same way.

05:49.383 --> 05:50.716
Angela:
How long did that one last?

05:50.718 --> 05:52.417
Agent Gibbs.

05:52.419 --> 05:54.052
Join us.
This is Angela,

05:54.054 --> 05:56.955
former special agent
dresser's ex-wife.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.623
We need to find your ex-husband.

05:58.625 --> 06:00.392
I heard.

06:00.394 --> 06:02.828
You need him to testify in
an old case he worked, right?

06:03.731 --> 06:06.665
She doesn't know where he is.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.500
When was the last time
you saw him?

06:08.502 --> 06:10.836
I haven't seen him in years.

06:10.838 --> 06:13.438
After our son
was killed,

06:13.440 --> 06:14.840
one day he just
didn't come home.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.441
I never saw him again.

06:16.443 --> 06:18.810
I try to wait up every year
on our anniversary,

06:18.812 --> 06:20.645
but I never seem to catch him.

06:20.647 --> 06:22.447
Monroe: What happens
on your anniversary?

06:22.449 --> 06:23.915
Kevin had a garden

06:23.917 --> 06:25.150
he loved.

06:25.152 --> 06:26.485
Used to grow parrot's beak,

06:26.487 --> 06:27.919
my favorite plant.

06:27.921 --> 06:30.655
Every year, on the day
we were married,

06:30.657 --> 06:32.824
he leaves a plant on my porch.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.092
When's the next anniversary?

06:34.094 --> 06:35.527
Just had one last week.

06:35.529 --> 06:37.629
So you still have the plant?

06:37.631 --> 06:39.765
Could we look at it?
Of course.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.400
Take her.
Mm-hmm.

06:41.402 --> 06:42.468
Pick it up.

06:42.469 --> 06:43.535
Agent: Yes, sir.
Thank you.

06:43.537 --> 06:44.669
Angela:
Sure.

06:45.639 --> 06:46.838
This way.

06:56.183 --> 06:58.784
Let me guess:
Why didn't I wait for you?

06:58.786 --> 07:00.202
Gibbs: Actually,

07:00.203 --> 07:01.619
why the<i> hell </i>
didn't you wait for me?

07:01.622 --> 07:03.955
Because of that right there.

07:03.957 --> 07:05.557
Gibbs... (Chuckles)

07:05.559 --> 07:08.193
I've been told I can be
scary on a good day, but you?

07:08.195 --> 07:10.429
I'm sure you're scary every day.

07:10.431 --> 07:11.763
Even worse on a day like today.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.698
And that woman did not
need to be scared.

07:30.751 --> 07:32.784
Abbs, you get a chance to
process the plant?
Shh!

07:32.786 --> 07:34.052
Gibbs.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.487
Here, better yet,
get over here.

07:35.489 --> 07:38.457
It's a prayer circle
for fornell.

07:38.459 --> 07:39.591
Close your eyes.

07:39.593 --> 07:40.492
Aw, Abby...

07:40.494 --> 07:41.960
For-Nell!

07:44.465 --> 07:45.697
Amen. Where were we?

07:45.699 --> 07:47.532
You get a chance
to run the plant?

07:47.534 --> 07:48.633
Examine the plant?
I did.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.469
You're gonna like
what I found--

07:50.471 --> 07:52.838
starting with agent dresser's
fingerprints on the pot,

07:52.840 --> 07:54.573
which confirms that
it did come from him.

07:54.575 --> 07:55.907
I also analyzed the soil.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.509
I found high levels of lead,

07:57.511 --> 07:59.044
which is common
in urban gardens.

07:59.046 --> 08:00.645
Lead pollution
sort of precipitates

08:00.647 --> 08:02.614
through the air and
then settles down on the soil.

08:02.616 --> 08:03.482
Lovely, huh?

08:03.484 --> 08:05.550
So, Abby, what?

08:05.552 --> 08:06.985
Dresser's living in a city.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.220
Yeah, well, that didn't
narrow it down much,

08:08.222 --> 08:09.455
but this will.

08:09.456 --> 08:10.689
I also found
an interesting mix

08:10.691 --> 08:13.592
of nitrogen oxide,
black carbon,

08:13.594 --> 08:15.494
and ultra-fine particles.

08:15.496 --> 08:19.531
That is a telltale sign of both
avgas and jet fuel combustion.

08:19.533 --> 08:21.199
So Kevin didn't
just live in a city...

08:21.201 --> 08:22.634
He's living
next to an airport.

08:22.636 --> 08:24.586
Yeah, and one that services

08:24.587 --> 08:26.537
both jets and old-school
propeller craft.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.373
Now, there's only

08:28.374 --> 08:30.207
three private airports
that fit that bill,

08:30.210 --> 08:32.177
and have a
residential area close enough

08:32.179 --> 08:33.879
(phone ringing)
To be contaminated like that.

08:33.881 --> 08:35.364
I made you a list.

08:35.365 --> 08:36.848
(Ringing continues)
Wow, that's really
good work, Abbs.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.183
Who is it?

08:38.185 --> 08:39.618
It's Emily.

08:39.620 --> 08:40.886
Hope everything's okay.
Yeah.

08:40.888 --> 08:42.120
Everything okay?

08:43.056 --> 08:44.289
What?

08:44.291 --> 08:45.757
Just stay where you are.

08:45.759 --> 08:46.992
You stay right where you are.

08:46.994 --> 08:49.628
Abby, get that
list to DiNozzo.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.265
Please calm down.
I am calm.

08:53.267 --> 08:54.566
You aren't bleeding.

08:54.568 --> 08:56.134
Gibbs:
Whoa, whoa. What's going on?

08:56.136 --> 08:57.636
I just found out my dad

08:57.638 --> 08:59.271
has a do not resuscitate order
in his file.

08:59.273 --> 09:00.689
We discovered the dnr

09:00.690 --> 09:02.106
when the FBI sent over
the medical records.

09:02.109 --> 09:04.943
It says if his heart stops,
they should just let him die!

09:04.945 --> 09:06.177
I want that thing gone.

09:06.179 --> 09:07.612
Now!
I know it's difficult,

09:07.614 --> 09:09.114
but your father signed
the order himself.

09:09.116 --> 09:10.582
The only thing
that's gonna be difficult

09:10.584 --> 09:12.217
is you trying to remove that...
Whoa, em.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.752
Calm down.

09:16.023 --> 09:17.556
She's his daughter.

09:17.558 --> 09:20.292
Come on, she doesn't have a say?
Unfortunately, no.

09:20.294 --> 09:22.327
Special agent fornell
specifically listed

09:22.329 --> 09:23.862
a non-family member

09:23.864 --> 09:25.564
as his durable power of attorney

09:25.566 --> 09:27.666
in the event he was unable
to make these decisions.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.134
Okay. Who is that?

09:29.136 --> 09:31.136
You, agent Gibbs.

09:31.138 --> 09:34.639
I presume that's
because he trusted

09:34.641 --> 09:37.576
you would comply
with his wishes.

09:37.578 --> 09:38.977
And his wishes were that he...
Uncle Gibbs,

09:38.979 --> 09:41.346
my dad must've filled
that out when he was a mess.

09:41.348 --> 09:44.249
He's better now! He probably
forgot it even existed.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.885
You know he would
never give up on me.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.653
On you. On the world.

09:48.655 --> 09:50.722
He's a fighter.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.023
Let him fight.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.625
Never crossed my mind not to.

09:55.362 --> 09:57.095
Agent Gibbs...

10:09.910 --> 10:11.209
Your mom would be proud, em.

10:11.211 --> 10:14.012
For a second there,
when I first got here,

10:14.014 --> 10:16.748
heard all that,
i thought it<i> was</i> your mom.

10:16.750 --> 10:17.949
(Quiet chuckle)

10:20.887 --> 10:23.121
You need anything?

10:23.123 --> 10:25.624
Yeah.

10:25.626 --> 10:27.092
I need my dad to be okay.

10:27.094 --> 10:29.861
And he needs you to
get the son of a bitch

10:29.863 --> 10:31.229
who did this to him.

10:31.231 --> 10:32.764
(Phone ringing)

10:37.037 --> 10:38.703
Yeah, it's Gibbs.
What do you got?

10:38.705 --> 10:41.706
We've had teams out canvassing
the areas on Abby's list.

10:41.708 --> 10:43.975
Someone recognized a photo
of former agent dresser.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.211
You get an address?
Texting it to you now.

10:46.213 --> 10:48.046
McGee and bishop are already
on their way.

10:52.686 --> 10:54.753
(Engine growling,
tires screeching)

10:58.859 --> 11:00.725
Did you confirm
it's agent dresser?

11:00.727 --> 11:02.961
Flyover shows a flower
garden in the backyard.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.195
House is leased
to a different name,

11:04.197 --> 11:05.263
but we think it's an alias.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.231
(Gunfire)

11:06.233 --> 11:07.699
Let's go.

11:07.701 --> 11:09.768
McGee, take the back.

11:12.839 --> 11:15.240
(Men grunting, fists thudding)

11:15.242 --> 11:17.242
(Crashing, glass shattering)

11:19.312 --> 11:21.379
(Grunting, thudding)

11:23.150 --> 11:24.215
(Grunting)

11:25.819 --> 11:27.752
Come on...
Gibbs: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Put it down.

11:27.754 --> 11:29.888
(Sudden grunt)
NCIS. Put it down.

11:31.792 --> 11:34.359
Hands in the air.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.327
(Panting)

11:36.329 --> 11:38.830
I won't be able
to show you my I.D.,

11:38.832 --> 11:39.864
agent Gibbs.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.466
Do I know you?

11:41.468 --> 11:43.168
I know you.

11:43.170 --> 11:45.236
You get rave reviews
from agent DiNozzo.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.405
Clayton Reeves,

11:47.407 --> 11:48.740
MI6.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.775
I.D. Is in
my front pocket.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.419
If you're MI6, who's that?

12:01.421 --> 12:03.722
I haven't the slightest idea.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.758
Get up.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.159
Slowly.

12:08.161 --> 12:10.862
(Grunting)

12:15.135 --> 12:16.367
Kort.

12:16.369 --> 12:17.869
As in CIA kort?

12:17.871 --> 12:20.271
Boo.

12:22.342 --> 12:24.909
I thought he only had one eye.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.958
(Camera shutter clicking)

12:42.295 --> 12:45.430
Looks like former agent dresser
didn't go down without a fight.

12:45.432 --> 12:46.931
Back door was
broken into.

12:46.933 --> 12:48.500
I was able to pull
a print here, too.

12:48.502 --> 12:50.769
Jacob. Again.
We were too late.

12:50.771 --> 12:52.771
Clayton: Picked up
a lead on Jacob

12:52.773 --> 12:55.874
after I landed in DC from
a contact of mine in liverpool.

12:55.876 --> 12:58.476
Followed the trail here,
saw the body through the window,

12:58.478 --> 13:01.112
came in to take a look, and
while I was checking the pulse,

13:01.114 --> 13:03.114
this ape tried to kill me.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.883
Yeah, well,

13:04.885 --> 13:06.084
I tend to shoot first,

13:06.086 --> 13:07.118
ask questions later

13:07.120 --> 13:08.086
when someone's standing

13:08.088 --> 13:09.954
over an old friend's dead body.

13:09.956 --> 13:12.290
Tony: You have friends?
Kort: Back off, DiNozzo.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.858
I was best man at his wedding.

13:13.860 --> 13:16.561
He called me
an hour ago.

13:16.563 --> 13:18.396
He said he thought
someone was following him.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.799
So I came over and ran into
James Bond here,

13:20.801 --> 13:23.868
who, as far as I'm concerned, is
still prime suspect number one.

13:23.870 --> 13:25.303
There a reason you
didn't tell DiNozzo

13:25.305 --> 13:26.538
you were heading
back to the states?

13:26.540 --> 13:27.539
Tony:
I hope it's not that bar tab

13:27.541 --> 13:29.841
you and I ran up in omsk.

13:29.843 --> 13:31.476
No.

13:31.478 --> 13:33.545
No, I just didn't know
my plans until I knew them.

13:33.547 --> 13:35.880
Besides, my lead
on Jacob was thin.

13:35.882 --> 13:37.315
Wait...

13:37.317 --> 13:39.184
We're not talking
of Jacob Scott, are we?

13:39.186 --> 13:40.518
Gibbs:
Yeah, we are.

13:40.520 --> 13:41.586
Keep talking.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.488
Kort:
I worked on his case in '02.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.190
It's how I met agent dresser

13:45.192 --> 13:46.558
and I'm guessing
why he called me

13:46.560 --> 13:48.560
if there's been
activity on it.

13:48.562 --> 13:50.495
Jacob Scott couldn't
have done this.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.563
He's been in prison.

13:51.565 --> 13:53.531
Escaped three weeks ago.

13:54.968 --> 13:56.067
Haven't you heard?

13:57.571 --> 13:58.603
CIA is slipping.

13:59.973 --> 14:01.172
I've been on assignment.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.841
Who's the CIA assassinating now?

14:02.843 --> 14:05.944
Jacob, if I can get
my hands on him.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.345
What's he after?

14:07.347 --> 14:09.581
Revenge.
For his wife's death.

14:09.583 --> 14:11.850
Who's left to kill?
Tony: Allen Kane.

14:11.852 --> 14:13.284
Dresser's old partner.

14:13.286 --> 14:15.587
He's gone off the grid,
and we cannot find him.

14:15.589 --> 14:17.022
McGee:
Think I just did.

14:17.023 --> 14:18.456
Looks like he and dresser
stayed in touch.

14:18.458 --> 14:19.858
There's an address in here.

14:19.860 --> 14:22.193
McGee, take
agent Monroe.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.328
Bring in Kane.

14:23.330 --> 14:24.562
Be careful, Tim.

14:24.564 --> 14:28.867
If we found that address,
Jacob might have too.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.880
All right, there you go.

14:41.882 --> 14:43.114
Said you liked it black, right?

14:43.116 --> 14:45.950
Said I wanted it black,
not that I liked it.

14:45.952 --> 14:47.485
But thank you.

14:47.487 --> 14:48.653
No prob.

14:51.892 --> 14:53.091
So any activity?

14:53.093 --> 14:54.993
Mm-mm.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.494
Monroe:
I say if Kane is not back

14:56.496 --> 14:58.229
within the hour, we go in.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.631
I just spoke to Gibbs.

14:59.633 --> 15:01.666
He said a half hour.
Something change?

15:01.668 --> 15:04.669
Yeah, that MI6 guy found
a suspicious deposit

15:04.671 --> 15:07.438
in Kane's bank account.
Kane's dirty?

15:07.440 --> 15:09.207
Well, we found out someone
warned the Russians

15:09.209 --> 15:11.976
back in '02 that we were
gonna grab Jacob's buyer.

15:11.978 --> 15:13.645
Looks like that might
have been Kane.

15:13.647 --> 15:15.079
Right.

15:15.081 --> 15:16.948
Half hour it is.

15:16.950 --> 15:19.951
We have to shoot this guy,
i get to take the shot.

15:19.953 --> 15:22.921
We're not shooting anyone.

15:22.923 --> 15:24.622
No, of course not.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.691
Just...<i> If</i> we do.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.928
I hate dirty cops.

15:29.930 --> 15:31.930
(Chuckles)

15:31.932 --> 15:33.998
So have you worked
with fornell long?

15:34.000 --> 15:35.633
Long enough.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.268
Wait, didn't you
just transfer

15:37.270 --> 15:38.670
from the New York
counterterrorism unit

15:38.672 --> 15:40.104
a few months ago?

15:40.106 --> 15:42.273
How long does it take
to get to know somebody?

15:42.275 --> 15:44.275
Well, actually, I think
it can take years

15:44.277 --> 15:46.010
to truly get to know someone.

15:46.012 --> 15:49.514
Is that why it took you so long
to propose to your girlfriend?

15:49.516 --> 15:53.184
Did someone tell you that I was
planning on proposing to her?

15:53.186 --> 15:55.219
You mean aside from just now?

15:57.223 --> 15:59.657
Look, you said some interesting
things during the night

15:59.659 --> 16:01.492
that gave me a gut feeling.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.494
Now you've just confirmed them.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.496
Could have just asked, you know?

16:05.498 --> 16:07.398
What's the fun in that?

16:08.969 --> 16:10.168
Got him.

16:13.006 --> 16:14.973
He's running.
Wait, don't shoot him.

16:14.975 --> 16:16.975
Don't shoot him!
Don't shoot him!

16:19.679 --> 16:20.645
(Tires screech, Kane grunts)

16:20.647 --> 16:21.713
(Horn honking)

16:27.754 --> 16:30.288
FBI. How's your morning going?

16:37.664 --> 16:39.664
Why am i
in interrogation?

16:39.666 --> 16:41.666
Why'd you run?

16:41.668 --> 16:44.736
Because I saw two people
staking out my place.

16:46.740 --> 16:48.773
So, is it true?

16:48.775 --> 16:51.042
Did Jacob Scott
kill my partner?

16:53.680 --> 16:56.714
Then I need to be in protective
custody, not here.

16:56.716 --> 16:58.282
Clayton:
And yet, here you are.

16:58.284 --> 16:59.684
In the bad guy room.

17:01.021 --> 17:04.055
Gibbs:
50 grand. Oof.

17:04.057 --> 17:05.456
To your account.

17:05.458 --> 17:08.793
Where'd that come from?

17:08.795 --> 17:10.628
Race track.

17:10.630 --> 17:11.763
Made some good bets.

17:11.765 --> 17:13.598
I got another bet for you.

17:15.068 --> 17:16.701
I bet Jacob Scott wasn't
the only person

17:16.703 --> 17:18.336
leaking info to the Russians.

17:18.338 --> 17:20.538
Gibbs:
Got a call log from 2002.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.141
From your cell phone to a
number that we couldn't trace.

17:23.143 --> 17:24.776
And that's my problem
because...?

17:24.778 --> 17:25.810
Clayton:
Bad timing.

17:25.812 --> 17:26.811
For you.

17:26.813 --> 17:29.047
Your call was placed

17:29.049 --> 17:31.149
just before the op to grab
Jason's wife went south.

17:31.151 --> 17:32.550
Someone told the Russians

17:32.552 --> 17:34.085
that their buyer was
about to be grabbed,

17:34.087 --> 17:36.354
and we think that
that someone was you.

17:39.592 --> 17:40.658
Where's Jacob?

17:43.596 --> 17:46.431
I'm not saying another word
till I talk to a lawyer.

17:46.433 --> 17:48.733
You know you're not the only one

17:48.735 --> 17:51.302
to sell out their country
to make a buck, right?

17:51.304 --> 17:52.737
I mean, I get it.
I mean, i-i got

17:52.739 --> 17:54.572
my own temptations
to deal with.

17:54.574 --> 17:57.075
In fact, you want to talk
about bad deals going bad?

17:57.077 --> 17:59.077
That's gonna be the name
of my autobiography.

17:59.079 --> 18:00.711
(Gibbs chuckles)

18:03.783 --> 18:05.850
But sometimes...

18:05.852 --> 18:09.153
Sometimes, you have to own
the choices you make.

18:09.155 --> 18:12.857
For you, bud, it's right now.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.661
Lawyer.

18:22.302 --> 18:25.103
You're not gonna need one.

18:25.105 --> 18:26.504
You're free to leave.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.439
I am?
Clayton: Yeah.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.274
Cheers.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.543
Just don't forget to wish
us luck before you go.

18:32.545 --> 18:35.480
For what?
That we find Jacob Scott
before he finds you.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.849
Yeah. And shoots
you in your face.

18:37.851 --> 18:39.484
I said I didn't know
where he was, okay?

18:39.486 --> 18:40.618
(Laughing):
Okay.

18:40.620 --> 18:41.719
See ya 'round.

18:41.720 --> 18:42.819
Look, I need to be
in protective custody.

18:42.822 --> 18:43.821
You can't do this!

18:43.823 --> 18:45.223
Really?

18:45.225 --> 18:46.224
Check this out.

18:46.226 --> 18:47.892
Leaving.

18:47.894 --> 18:49.193
With my feet.
(Laughs)

18:49.195 --> 18:50.795
Wait, wait. Stop, stop!

18:55.869 --> 18:57.902
I don't know
where Jacob is, okay?

18:59.906 --> 19:01.572
But I know he had a safe house.

19:01.574 --> 19:04.175
Not official,
just for himself.

19:04.177 --> 19:05.409
In an old motel somewhere.

19:05.411 --> 19:06.811
If he's on the run,

19:06.813 --> 19:08.446
he'll go there at some point.

19:08.448 --> 19:11.315
That's all I know.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.851
Now, put me in protective
custody, damn it.

19:13.853 --> 19:16.854
(Various people screaming,
groaning, moaning)

19:16.856 --> 19:19.924
Bishop: Looks like the motel
isn't a motel anymore.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.559
Tony:
Yeah, motel California.

19:21.561 --> 19:23.227
You can check out,
but you can never leave.

19:23.229 --> 19:24.629
What is going on in these rooms?

19:24.631 --> 19:26.597
Release!

19:26.599 --> 19:28.232
I leased the building,

19:28.234 --> 19:30.168
converted it into a health
clinic last year.

19:30.170 --> 19:32.170
Our clients now come
to experience

19:32.172 --> 19:33.471
the release of rolfing.

19:33.473 --> 19:34.906
Uh, rolfing?
Yes.

19:34.908 --> 19:36.274
It's a form of intense

19:36.276 --> 19:38.309
myofascial manipulation
that...

19:38.311 --> 19:39.310
(Woman moaning in distance)

19:39.312 --> 19:40.945
(Sighing):
Oh...

19:40.947 --> 19:42.580
Sounds like my
kind of place.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.282
I'm special
agent DiNozzo.

19:44.284 --> 19:46.684
This is special
agent bishop.
Wow, that was quick.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.753
I just called the police
a few minutes ago.

19:52.959 --> 19:55.359
Woman: I lock my office door
every night,

19:55.361 --> 19:58.262
but when I came in
this morning, it was open.

19:59.465 --> 20:01.532
Then I saw this
on my security cam.

20:05.238 --> 20:07.105
It's Jacob.

20:07.106 --> 20:08.973
This must have been the room
he used for his safe house.

20:08.975 --> 20:10.608
Who's Jacob?

20:10.610 --> 20:12.610
Someone in need of a release.

20:14.981 --> 20:16.714
Tony:
Huh.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.282
What did this guy
hide in my wall?

20:18.284 --> 20:19.984
Tony: Who knows?
Fake I.D., money.

20:19.986 --> 20:21.919
Could be anything.

20:21.921 --> 20:25.957
Stop following me,
or more people will get hurt.

20:31.864 --> 20:33.698
Bishop: Tony and i
scoured the entire room,

20:33.700 --> 20:35.933
didn't find anything else,
but Abby wanted to see

20:35.935 --> 20:37.969
everything from the office,
just to be sure.

20:37.971 --> 20:39.971
Eyewitnesses?
Not yet.

20:39.973 --> 20:42.873
But agent Monroe and Reeves
are canvassing the area.

20:44.644 --> 20:48.246
Scott: Stop following me,
or more people will get hurt.

20:48.248 --> 20:49.714
Bishop: Is he saying that
he'll stop killing people

20:49.716 --> 20:51.816
if we just get off his back?

20:51.818 --> 20:54.318
Does he want revenge or not?
Wait, back it up.

20:57.257 --> 20:58.522
Freeze it, right there.

21:01.394 --> 21:02.860
Bishop:
What's he looking at?

21:08.768 --> 21:11.569
It's their Wi-Fi password.
Abby: And somebody used it.

21:11.571 --> 21:14.972
I finished analyzing the
router from the office.

21:14.974 --> 21:16.307
Someone logged into
their wireless Internet

21:16.309 --> 21:17.808
just after the break-in.

21:18.845 --> 21:21.345
Bishop: Has to be Jacob.
What was he doing?

21:21.347 --> 21:23.281
Abby: He was searching
for someone.
Bishop: Who?

21:23.283 --> 21:24.582
He's looking for...

21:25.952 --> 21:28.019
...Ziva.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.766
No. Ziva's cell is disconnected,
and she's not answering e-mail.

21:41.768 --> 21:43.801
McGee: Boss, I'm calling
everyone I can think of.

21:43.803 --> 21:44.835
No one knows where she is.

21:44.837 --> 21:46.070
Somebody knows.

21:46.072 --> 21:47.972
Keep trying.
Doesn't make any sense.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.774
Why is Jacob trying
to find Ziva?

21:49.776 --> 21:51.008
She doesn't have anything to do
with his espionage gigs.

21:51.010 --> 21:52.877
Bishop:
Agent munro is down with ducky

21:52.879 --> 21:55.479
to see if he has any insight
into Jacob's mental state.

21:55.481 --> 21:58.449
We are missing something.
The original CIA case files.

21:58.451 --> 22:00.685
I texted kort to get over here,
but I haven't heard back.

22:00.687 --> 22:02.853
You didn't say please.

22:02.855 --> 22:04.455
Texted you an hour ago.

22:04.457 --> 22:06.724
I'm not your lap dog.
I was working.

22:06.726 --> 22:08.726
Jacob Scott's
espionage case.

22:08.728 --> 22:10.094
Can you get us the case files?

22:10.096 --> 22:11.329
May I ask why?

22:11.331 --> 22:12.830
Because he's looking for Ziva.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.933
Ziva? That doesn't
make any sense.

22:15.935 --> 22:17.635
She had nothing to do with it.

22:17.637 --> 22:19.804
We know that.
Just get the files.

22:19.806 --> 22:21.806
Worried about
your girlfriend, DiNozzo?

22:21.808 --> 22:23.607
What's that supposed to mean?

22:27.880 --> 22:29.547
You gonna call
your attack dog off?

22:29.549 --> 22:30.881
No.

22:32.485 --> 22:33.884
Fair enough.

22:33.886 --> 22:36.654
Not one of my classier moments.

22:36.656 --> 22:38.356
Ziva can take care
of herself, Tony.

22:38.358 --> 22:39.056
You know that.

22:39.058 --> 22:41.459
But I'll, uh, ask around,

22:41.461 --> 22:42.827
see if anyone's
heard from her.

22:43.763 --> 22:45.830
Okay?

22:49.802 --> 22:51.402
Looking for Ziva?

22:51.404 --> 22:53.437
Are you sure,
agent Monroe?

22:53.439 --> 22:55.005
Your forensic scientist
seems to be.

22:55.007 --> 22:56.874
And I make it a point
to never question

22:56.876 --> 22:59.510
ph.D's wearing
dog collars.

22:59.512 --> 23:01.479
Yeah, but why Ziva?

23:01.481 --> 23:03.814
Million-dollar question.

23:03.816 --> 23:05.816
So, penny for
your thoughts, doc.

23:05.818 --> 23:10.054
I took the Liberty
of working up a psych profile

23:10.056 --> 23:12.056
of Jacob Scott two weeks ago.

23:12.058 --> 23:15.493
But none of his behavior
has made any sense at all.

23:15.495 --> 23:17.628
I wouldn't have pegged him
for the revenge type,

23:17.630 --> 23:20.464
but this trail of bodies
suggests otherwise.

23:20.466 --> 23:22.767
Of course, it is possible

23:22.769 --> 23:24.869
we're dealing with
a true sociopath.

23:24.871 --> 23:26.103
Again!

23:26.105 --> 23:29.607
(Laughs)

23:29.609 --> 23:31.942
It's-it's just that
we've-we've had

23:31.944 --> 23:33.978
a number of them
over the years and...

23:33.980 --> 23:36.680
And they're really,
um, see...

23:36.682 --> 23:38.115
Um, right, right, sociopathy--

23:38.117 --> 23:39.750
not something to joke about.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.018
I-i see where
you're coming from.

23:41.020 --> 23:44.522
It is possible, however,

23:44.524 --> 23:46.190
that Jacob has simply
run out of targets

23:46.192 --> 23:48.592
but not the need for vengeance.

23:48.594 --> 23:51.429
In which case,
he would begin to,

23:51.431 --> 23:53.030
well, target us.

23:53.032 --> 23:54.432
Or those close to us.

23:54.434 --> 23:55.866
And this Ziva fits the bill?

23:55.868 --> 23:57.601
Uh-huh.
Jimmy:
And then some.

24:01.908 --> 24:05.075
Have you ever done
a psych profile on Gibbs?

24:06.913 --> 24:07.878
Excuse me?

24:07.880 --> 24:09.447
I've heard a lot about him

24:09.449 --> 24:10.781
from agent fornell.

24:14.120 --> 24:17.788
Seems like a pretty
complex guy.

24:17.790 --> 24:20.090
Just kind of curious
what floats his boat.

24:20.092 --> 24:22.793
I don't think his boat
would float right now.

24:22.795 --> 24:25.830
If I had conducted
such a profile,

24:25.832 --> 24:28.532
the results would be
strictly confidential.

24:29.902 --> 24:32.670
Well, I'm sure I can get it
out of this one easily enough.

24:33.806 --> 24:36.073
Okay, a) "This one" has a name:
Jimmy Palmer.

24:36.075 --> 24:39.210
Nice to meet you.
B) You...

24:39.212 --> 24:40.845
Make me nervous.

24:43.850 --> 24:45.149
Hey.

24:45.151 --> 24:47.151
Gibbs wants an update on
agent dresser's autopsy.

24:47.153 --> 24:48.986
Yeah, great. Uh...

24:48.988 --> 24:50.654
Doctor confirmed that
the cause of death

24:50.656 --> 24:52.556
was blood loss due to
multiple stab wounds.

24:52.558 --> 24:53.924
Ducky:
Yes, that's correct.

24:53.926 --> 24:55.659
But judging by those cuts,

24:55.661 --> 24:58.696
it would appear our victim
had a knife of his own

24:58.698 --> 25:00.130
and used it quite effectively.

25:00.132 --> 25:02.900
There were multiple blood
types found on the clothing.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.870
So Jacob was wounded.
Ducky:
Yes.

25:05.872 --> 25:07.571
And judging by the blood loss,

25:07.573 --> 25:10.007
Jacob might well
have required stitches

25:10.009 --> 25:11.542
after the altercation.

25:11.544 --> 25:14.545
So I would suggest that
you distribute his picture

25:14.547 --> 25:17.181
to all the local
hospitals in the area.

25:17.183 --> 25:19.884
I've already sent his photo
to my colleague,

25:19.886 --> 25:21.785
where fornell is recovering.

25:21.787 --> 25:23.087
Any news about fornell?

25:23.089 --> 25:24.588
Yes.

25:24.590 --> 25:26.190
He's been upgraded
to stable,

25:26.192 --> 25:28.792
but he has yet
to regain consciousness.

25:28.794 --> 25:30.027
And the longer
that takes,

25:30.029 --> 25:32.162
the worse his prognosis becomes.

25:36.168 --> 25:38.102
Emily:
As you may recall,

25:38.104 --> 25:39.870
I've been trying
to give you a pedicure

25:39.872 --> 25:42.206
for the last
seven years.

25:43.709 --> 25:45.142
Which...

25:45.144 --> 25:46.810
Now that I see your feet,

25:46.812 --> 25:50.014
I regret not bringing
a biohazard suit with me.

25:51.984 --> 25:53.784
Either way...

25:53.786 --> 25:55.553
This is your last chance.

25:55.555 --> 25:57.688
Wake up right now.

25:57.690 --> 25:59.857
Or wake up later

25:59.859 --> 26:01.926
with soles as soft
as a baby's bottom.

26:04.997 --> 26:06.096
Okay, suit yourself.

26:10.036 --> 26:11.268
Dad?

26:13.005 --> 26:14.338
Dad?

26:16.142 --> 26:17.575
Dad?

26:17.577 --> 26:19.577
Can you hear me?
It's Emily.

26:19.579 --> 26:21.211
Open your eyes if
you can hear me.

26:22.582 --> 26:23.914
I love you, dad!

26:23.916 --> 26:26.283
Now open your eyes,
or so help me,

26:26.285 --> 26:27.885
I will paint
little watermelons

26:27.887 --> 26:29.219
on all ten toes!

26:30.656 --> 26:31.889
What?

26:31.891 --> 26:33.657
What is it?
You love me, too?

26:33.659 --> 26:34.892
Gibbs...

26:34.894 --> 26:37.127
What?

26:37.129 --> 26:38.596
Gibbs...

26:38.598 --> 26:40.664
Gibbs what?

26:41.634 --> 26:42.633
Channel up.

26:42.635 --> 26:44.068
Female voice:
Changing channel.

26:44.070 --> 26:46.136
What time is it?

26:46.138 --> 26:48.072
Female voice:
11:58 A.M.

26:48.074 --> 26:52.242
What is... the airspeed velocity

26:52.244 --> 26:54.778
of an unladen swallow?

26:54.780 --> 26:57.848
Female voice:
African or European?
African or European?

26:57.850 --> 27:00.184
Wouldn't have pegged you
for a monty python fan.

27:00.186 --> 27:01.251
That makes two of us.

27:01.253 --> 27:02.853
What's in the box?

27:02.855 --> 27:04.655
Forensics from
the original

27:04.657 --> 27:06.290
espionage case
against Jacob Scott.

27:06.292 --> 27:08.993
Per herr Gibbs' request.

27:08.995 --> 27:10.394
Executive summary?

27:10.396 --> 27:13.931
Jacob was leaking nuclear
intel to the Russians.

27:13.933 --> 27:16.333
Data on who exactly had what.

27:16.335 --> 27:19.136
Something our allies
prefer to keep quiet.

27:19.138 --> 27:21.839
Oh...

27:21.841 --> 27:24.341
Gibbs wanted me to ask if
you found anything yet.

27:24.343 --> 27:26.110
A mystery.

27:26.112 --> 27:29.279
So Jacob let himself be
recorded that whole time

27:29.281 --> 27:30.714
and<i> then</i> turns
the camera off.

27:30.716 --> 27:32.082
What was he doing?

27:32.084 --> 27:33.951
Something he didn't
want us to see.

27:33.953 --> 27:37.087
Yeah. Luckily, I know how
we can still listen in.

27:37.089 --> 27:38.989
Read this.

27:38.991 --> 27:41.191
It's part of the user
agreement for the smart TV

27:41.193 --> 27:43.093
that was in the
office with Jacob.

27:43.095 --> 27:44.928
Kort: "Be aware that
any spoken words

27:44.930 --> 27:46.897
"may be captured and
transmitted to a third party

27:46.899 --> 27:49.933
when you utilize
voice control."

27:49.935 --> 27:51.802
So while you're
listening to your TV,

27:51.804 --> 27:53.103
your TV is listening to you.

27:53.105 --> 27:55.105
Only it doesn't
record your voice.

27:55.107 --> 27:58.108
It reduces it into a data stream
which I am in the process

27:58.110 --> 28:01.245
of reverse-engineering
to recreate the content.

28:01.247 --> 28:03.947
Not much point for the CIA
to bug people anymore,

28:03.949 --> 28:05.783
if they're just
going to bug themselves.

28:05.785 --> 28:07.351
I've got something.

28:07.353 --> 28:10.220
Okay, it looks like
Jacob made a phone call,

28:10.222 --> 28:12.356
asking someone
to borrow their jet.

28:12.358 --> 28:13.724
Must be nice.

28:13.726 --> 28:15.125
He say where he wants to go?

28:16.095 --> 28:17.394
Abby:
Tel Aviv.

28:17.396 --> 28:19.830
If Jacob is headed
to Israel,

28:19.832 --> 28:22.733
he must have a lead on Ziva.

28:24.770 --> 28:26.070
Boss, we got Jacob's photo

28:26.072 --> 28:28.205
at every private airport
from here to Ohio.

28:28.207 --> 28:30.207
Bishop: Tony and officer Reeves
are monitoring roadside cameras

28:30.209 --> 28:32.743
in MTAC.
McGee:
And agent Monroe's
coordinating

28:32.745 --> 28:34.178
with air-traffic control
on the Israeli side.

28:34.180 --> 28:35.746
Who did Jacob call?

28:36.916 --> 28:39.750
If he gets to Ziva
before we do...

28:39.752 --> 28:42.486
Boss, I checked the cell tower
near that massage parlor.

28:42.488 --> 28:44.221
(Phone ringing)
Over a thousand calls
were routed through there.

28:44.222 --> 28:45.955
This is bishop.
It's gonna take forever
to track these down.

28:47.159 --> 28:48.392
Uh, Gibbs...

28:48.394 --> 28:50.194
It's Emily;
She needs to talk to you.

28:50.196 --> 28:51.328
She says it's
an emergency.

28:51.330 --> 28:52.763
Hey.

28:52.765 --> 28:55.032
Hey. Your dad okay?

28:55.034 --> 28:56.266
Emily:
He woke up.

28:56.268 --> 28:57.935
Just for a few seconds,
but he woke up.

28:59.238 --> 29:01.271
Gibbs:
That's great.

29:01.273 --> 29:02.823
(Laughs):
Em, that's great.

29:02.824 --> 29:04.374
Listen, uh, we're in the middle
of something here.

29:04.376 --> 29:06.443
I know.
That's why I'm calling you.

29:06.445 --> 29:08.312
I... think he wanted me
to tell you something.

29:08.314 --> 29:09.847
About the case.

29:09.849 --> 29:11.381
Okay, I'm gonna put you
on speaker.

29:11.383 --> 29:13.083
Yeah. Go.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.852
He wasn't making a lot of sense.

29:14.854 --> 29:18.789
Someone named Jessica, I think,

29:18.791 --> 29:21.258
got a call from... someone?

29:21.260 --> 29:22.893
I don't know who.

29:22.895 --> 29:25.763
Then my dad just kept repeating
the phrase "giff-gaff"

29:25.765 --> 29:27.030
over and over.

29:27.032 --> 29:28.332
I have no idea what it means.

29:28.334 --> 29:29.767
All right. Stay by the phone.

29:29.769 --> 29:31.034
Okay.

29:31.036 --> 29:32.202
Jessica. Jessica terdei.

29:32.204 --> 29:34.271
She was with fornell
when he got shot.

29:34.273 --> 29:36.406
Sounds like she got a call from
someone before she was killed.

29:36.408 --> 29:38.142
Maybe some kind of lead.

29:38.144 --> 29:39.910
Vance said she still
might have connections.

29:39.912 --> 29:41.545
What's "giff-gaff"?

29:41.547 --> 29:43.347
A cellular company in the uk.

29:43.349 --> 29:45.916
Agent DiNozzo's updates.

29:45.918 --> 29:47.785
And I see
I've arrived just in time.

29:47.787 --> 29:50.287
Why is fornell talking
about a uk cell company?

29:50.289 --> 29:52.289
There was a huge robbery at one
of their warehouses last month.

29:52.291 --> 29:54.057
Since then, we've been
finding their cell phones

29:54.059 --> 29:55.793
all over the black market.

29:55.795 --> 29:58.228
Perhaps my old chief got a tip
that Jacob was using one.

29:58.230 --> 29:59.863
Check that cell tower again.

30:02.468 --> 30:04.001
All right, got one.

30:05.271 --> 30:06.236
Unregistered.

30:06.238 --> 30:07.805
Has to be Jacob.
Location?

30:07.807 --> 30:09.540
Working on it.

30:09.542 --> 30:11.208
He's still in DC.

30:11.210 --> 30:12.442
Come on, we got to do
better than that.
It's coming up.

30:13.846 --> 30:15.179
Boss, he's in the Navy yard.

30:15.181 --> 30:17.314
Without being seen?
He's MI6.
That's what we do.

30:17.316 --> 30:19.249
Call security--
lock down the yard!

30:19.251 --> 30:21.151
Boss, main elevator.
Bishop: He's here?

30:27.259 --> 30:30.027
I understand that you've
been looking for me?

30:33.332 --> 30:34.898
Well, here I am.

30:49.582 --> 30:50.581
Bishop:
What's his game?

30:50.583 --> 30:52.316
Tony:
I don't know.

30:52.318 --> 30:54.318
But he's pretty relaxed
for a wanted fugitive.

30:54.320 --> 30:56.587
Let me in there.
I'll unrelax him.

30:56.589 --> 30:58.222
I got this.

31:09.535 --> 31:11.068
I didn't shoot
agent fornell.

31:11.070 --> 31:12.369
And I didn't kill
chief terdei.

31:12.371 --> 31:13.370
Or agent dresser?

31:13.372 --> 31:14.605
That's right.

31:16.642 --> 31:19.376
Okay, then I guess
you're free to leave.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.144
You need us
to validate?

31:21.146 --> 31:23.280
I'm being framed,
agent Gibbs.

31:23.282 --> 31:25.249
Someone is--
i got a trail

31:25.251 --> 31:27.017
of dead bodies!

31:27.019 --> 31:29.319
I've got your fingerprints
at every crime scene.

31:29.321 --> 31:31.054
In my house!

31:32.391 --> 31:33.624
What do you want
with Ziva David?

31:33.626 --> 31:35.659
You have my prints
at your house?

31:35.661 --> 31:37.494
Ziva David-- why are
you looking for her?!

31:37.496 --> 31:38.896
Agent Gibbs,

31:38.898 --> 31:40.364
I've never been to your house.

31:40.366 --> 31:42.165
And I'm looking for Ziva David,

31:42.167 --> 31:43.567
because she can help
prove I'm innocent.

31:43.569 --> 31:46.403
I'm being set up
for those murders.

31:46.405 --> 31:49.640
Just like I was set up for
that espionage charge in 2002.

31:49.642 --> 31:52.276
They framed me.

31:52.278 --> 31:53.911
They killed my wife.

31:55.047 --> 31:57.047
Ziva.

31:57.049 --> 32:00.517
I went to an old safe house
to get some cash.

32:00.519 --> 32:04.221
But I found a note
from nika, my wife, instead.

32:04.223 --> 32:05.589
She heard
from an embassy contact

32:05.591 --> 32:08.191
that the director of the Mossad
had private files

32:08.193 --> 32:10.260
that prove I'd been framed.

32:10.262 --> 32:11.395
Well, that's news to us.

32:11.397 --> 32:13.363
He never shared it
with the Americans.

32:13.365 --> 32:14.398
I don't know why.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.934
"He"-- you mean
director David?

32:16.936 --> 32:17.968
That's right.

32:17.970 --> 32:19.403
Ziva's father.

32:19.405 --> 32:20.604
With him dead,
i assumed

32:20.606 --> 32:23.573
she inherited
his private files.

32:23.575 --> 32:25.642
That's why
i was looking for her.

32:27.413 --> 32:30.314
Maybe I would've found
her on my own, maybe not.

32:30.316 --> 32:32.316
But you never
would've found me.

32:32.318 --> 32:35.085
I didn't have
to turn myself in.

32:35.087 --> 32:36.586
Why did you?

32:36.588 --> 32:37.587
Because of you.

32:37.589 --> 32:39.022
When Ziva David's name

32:39.024 --> 32:41.591
came on my radar,
i did my homework.

32:41.593 --> 32:43.193
That led to you,
and I learned

32:43.195 --> 32:45.062
all I needed to know
pretty quickly.

32:45.064 --> 32:48.265
I came to you because
i believe you're someone

32:48.267 --> 32:50.367
who won't stop
until you find the truth.

32:50.369 --> 32:52.269
I already know the truth.

32:52.271 --> 32:54.338
Truth is I'm innocent.

32:54.340 --> 32:56.673
And you're gonna
help me prove it.

33:02.448 --> 33:04.047
What the hell is going on?

33:04.049 --> 33:05.048
Tell me about it.

33:05.050 --> 33:06.249
Is this guy Jacob for real?

33:06.251 --> 33:07.451
He really claims
to have an alibi

33:07.453 --> 33:09.319
for the shooting
at your house?
Yep.

33:09.321 --> 33:10.620
Does it check out?
Monroe:
I got a team on it.

33:10.622 --> 33:12.389
But I'm not
holding my breath.

33:12.391 --> 33:13.690
This guy's a
professional liar.

33:13.692 --> 33:14.658
So what's his game?

33:14.660 --> 33:16.193
Come on, Gibbs.

33:16.195 --> 33:17.194
What's that gut of yours say?

33:17.196 --> 33:18.729
Monroe:
Oh, right, the gut.

33:18.731 --> 33:20.230
I've heard about your gut.

33:21.467 --> 33:23.234
Gibbs, give me something.

33:23.235 --> 33:25.002
You're not gonna like it.
He's a fugitive.

33:25.004 --> 33:27.371
Please don't tell me that you
think he's telling the truth.

33:27.373 --> 33:28.705
Monroe:
Come on, like you said--

33:28.707 --> 33:30.507
we got this guy's prints

33:30.509 --> 33:32.175
at all our crime scenes!

33:32.177 --> 33:33.277
Yep, I know that.

33:33.278 --> 33:34.378
We got motive,
we got opportunity.

33:34.380 --> 33:35.379
Gibbs:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:35.381 --> 33:36.680
I work here, too.

33:40.452 --> 33:42.319
Okay.

33:42.321 --> 33:43.720
Jacob's telling the truth.

33:43.722 --> 33:46.423
Well, so much for not
holding your breath.

33:46.425 --> 33:48.258
Look, I don't always
know the answer,

33:48.260 --> 33:50.427
but I can tell when somebody
sees something that I don't.

33:50.429 --> 33:53.196
I'm willing to ride in the
gibbsmobile for a little while.

33:53.198 --> 33:55.198
If Eli David had information
that Jacob was framed,

33:55.200 --> 33:56.400
why not share it?

33:56.402 --> 33:57.734
It wasn't his problem.

33:57.736 --> 33:59.169
Yeah, and you
never know when that

33:59.171 --> 34:00.270
information could
come in handy.

34:00.272 --> 34:01.371
Blackmail, extortion,

34:01.373 --> 34:02.406
horse trading.

34:02.408 --> 34:03.440
Yeah, that does have the ring

34:03.442 --> 34:04.775
of Eli David to it.

34:04.777 --> 34:06.743
Find those files,
we see for ourselves.

34:06.745 --> 34:08.111
Just like Jacob wants.

34:08.113 --> 34:09.746
Do we have any leads?

34:09.748 --> 34:12.382
Monroe:
I've been in touch with our
Israeli liaison about Ziva.

34:12.384 --> 34:14.217
Scuttlebutt
is Eli had a farmhouse

34:14.219 --> 34:16.219
in the country
where she might be staying.

34:16.221 --> 34:18.121
Files might be there.

34:18.123 --> 34:20.090
All right, Gibbs,
check it out.

34:20.092 --> 34:21.291
Monroe, talk
to agent Kane again,

34:21.293 --> 34:22.943
see if anything shakes out.

34:22.944 --> 34:24.594
Of course, if Jacob Scott
didn't kill those people,

34:24.596 --> 34:26.363
we have an entirely
different problem.

34:26.365 --> 34:27.798
Abby: I can tell
you one person

34:27.800 --> 34:30.367
that Jacob Scott
definitely did not kill.

34:32.504 --> 34:36.239
I just finished typing the blood
sample that we got from Jacob.

34:36.241 --> 34:38.308
He has type ab-negative.

34:38.310 --> 34:41.678
Now whoever bled all over
dresser is type o-positive.

34:41.680 --> 34:44.247
Jacob is<i> not</i> the killer.

34:44.249 --> 34:46.116
You rerun the prints
from my house?

34:46.118 --> 34:48.285
Yes, captain.
Just like you asked.

34:48.287 --> 34:50.587
Four times-- I get the same
result every single time.

34:50.589 --> 34:54.257
The fingerprint that McGee
took from your house

34:54.259 --> 34:56.426
is a perfect
match to Jacob's.

34:56.428 --> 34:58.128
Too perfect.

34:58.130 --> 35:00.397
If you look,
there's minor imperfections

35:00.399 --> 35:02.332
in the print--
that's totally normal.

35:02.334 --> 35:04.101
But compare this print

35:04.103 --> 35:05.702
to the print
from Jacob's file--

35:05.704 --> 35:09.539
they have the exact same
minor imperfections.

35:09.541 --> 35:13.443
Now, the odds of that are
one in "not bloody likely,"

35:13.445 --> 35:16.279
as officer Reeves may say.

35:16.281 --> 35:20.150
I think someone used Jacob's
file to create a fake print.

35:20.152 --> 35:21.585
Is there any way to trace it?

35:21.587 --> 35:22.619
No.

35:22.621 --> 35:24.605
Our best bet now

35:24.606 --> 35:26.590
is the blood DNA from whoever
killed agent dresser,

35:26.592 --> 35:28.358
which is gonna be
ready any second now.

35:28.360 --> 35:29.559
All right, let me know.
No, like...

35:29.561 --> 35:33.196
<i> Literally...</i> Any second now.

35:34.166 --> 35:35.365
(Computer beeping)

35:35.367 --> 35:36.566
See?

35:36.568 --> 35:38.635
Let's see who is behind
door number...

35:38.637 --> 35:40.370
"Who killed dresser?"

35:40.372 --> 35:42.239
Whoa!

35:43.242 --> 35:45.475
Just when I was starting
to kind of like him.

35:48.514 --> 35:49.746
We got a ping
from kort's cell.

35:49.748 --> 35:51.581
Where?
At the, uh, zoo.

35:51.583 --> 35:52.749
At least
as of two hours ago.

35:52.751 --> 35:54.584
(Sighs)
Doing what?

35:54.586 --> 35:56.520
Well, probably visiting his
family at the reptile house.

35:56.522 --> 35:58.522
Problem is he turned
his cell phone off.

35:58.524 --> 36:00.357
We don't know
where he is right now.

36:00.359 --> 36:02.192
Whatever he's up to,
he's not doing it for the CIA.

36:02.194 --> 36:03.660
He lied to us.

36:03.662 --> 36:05.829
Heard from a friend at NSA
kort was fired last month.

36:05.831 --> 36:07.430
So who's he working for?

36:07.432 --> 36:08.632
Good question.

36:08.633 --> 36:09.833
Is Kane still in there?
With agent Monroe.

36:09.835 --> 36:11.351
I told her to wait.

36:11.352 --> 36:12.868
Kane: I don't know what the
hell you're talking about!

36:12.871 --> 36:14.738
Monroe: We know you do.
We're gonna find out...

36:14.740 --> 36:15.939
We taking over?

36:15.941 --> 36:18.775
No, we'll see what she's got.

36:18.777 --> 36:20.644
DiNozzo, you find kort.

36:20.646 --> 36:21.811
Take bishop with you.

36:21.813 --> 36:23.446
Let's go.

36:23.448 --> 36:25.615
Monroe (Over speaker):
Who gave you the 50 grand?

36:25.617 --> 36:27.951
Clayton: I'd seriously consider
answering the question, mate.

36:27.953 --> 36:30.554
Kane: I told you,
i won it at the races!

36:30.556 --> 36:31.555
(Groans)

36:31.557 --> 36:32.689
Yeah.

36:32.691 --> 36:35.358
Yeah, that's what you
keep saying.

36:38.597 --> 36:40.830
So this is what
i want you to do.

36:42.768 --> 36:46.403
Now I want you to tell me that
one more time.

36:46.405 --> 36:48.538
How you won that money
at the races.

36:48.540 --> 36:51.575
Can you do that?

36:51.577 --> 36:53.577
It's easy,
you just open your mouth

36:53.579 --> 36:55.879
and say,

36:55.881 --> 36:59.616
"i won that money,
50 grand,

36:59.618 --> 37:01.718
betting on horses."

37:01.720 --> 37:03.653
Can you do that?

37:03.655 --> 37:04.788
For me?

37:06.959 --> 37:09.359
Please?

37:09.361 --> 37:10.527
Then what happens?

37:10.529 --> 37:12.896
I can't wait to find out.

37:12.898 --> 37:13.997
Same here.

37:13.999 --> 37:16.399
Kane:
I didn't get that 50 grand

37:16.401 --> 37:18.902
betting on horses.

37:20.239 --> 37:22.539
Good boy. Thank you.

37:22.541 --> 37:24.274
Clayton:
Trent kort gave it to you.

37:24.276 --> 37:24.874
Didn't he?

37:26.878 --> 37:28.678
No!

37:28.680 --> 37:30.447
(Grunting)

37:31.550 --> 37:33.617
My associate
asked you a question.

37:33.619 --> 37:35.585
We know you and
kort are buddies.

37:35.587 --> 37:36.886
We were finally
able to trace

37:36.888 --> 37:38.755
that mystery call
of yours in 2002.

37:38.757 --> 37:40.523
We were?
No.

37:40.525 --> 37:41.558
Clayton:
We know you called kort.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.326
What we don't know is why.

37:43.328 --> 37:44.527
Kort's going down.
If you don't talk,

37:44.529 --> 37:45.795
you're gonna go down with him.

37:45.797 --> 37:47.897
You ever been
arrested for murder?

37:47.899 --> 37:49.432
I heard it's terrifying.

37:49.434 --> 37:50.634
I didn't kill anyone.

37:50.636 --> 37:52.302
Monroe: This is what
it sounds like.

37:52.304 --> 37:53.603
You have the right
to remain silent--

37:53.605 --> 37:55.505
okay, okay, stop!

37:56.875 --> 37:58.541
I'll talk.

38:00.646 --> 38:01.645
No.

38:01.647 --> 38:03.346
You're gonna sing.

38:04.549 --> 38:06.316
And it better be pretty.

38:06.318 --> 38:09.586
(Sighs)

38:11.857 --> 38:15.659
Kort was the one selling secrets
to the Russians, not Jacob.

38:15.661 --> 38:19.663
He just used Jacob and his wife
to take the fall.

38:19.665 --> 38:22.399
Then he had her killed before
anyone could look too close.

38:22.401 --> 38:23.933
That's a tidy package.

38:23.935 --> 38:25.869
Until Jacob busted
out of prison

38:25.871 --> 38:27.637
and was gonna
blow the whole thing.

38:27.639 --> 38:29.739
I'm curious.

38:29.741 --> 38:32.509
How have you been
sleeping at night?

38:32.511 --> 38:33.943
I didn't know kort was
gonna kill Jacob's wife.

38:33.945 --> 38:35.712
He just paid me
to keep him updated

38:35.714 --> 38:37.747
on what NCIS was doing!

38:37.749 --> 38:40.550
Not bad, boss.

38:40.552 --> 38:42.085
That's what the money was for.

38:46.458 --> 38:48.992
I hope it was worth it.

38:53.498 --> 38:54.664
All right, I'll
check in with Tony.

38:54.666 --> 38:55.965
See if there's
any leads on kort.

38:57.102 --> 38:58.768
You wanted to see me?

38:58.770 --> 38:59.736
Take 'em off.

38:59.738 --> 39:01.354
(Handcuffs clicking)

39:01.355 --> 39:02.971
You know, technically,
I'm still a wanted fugitive.

39:02.974 --> 39:04.941
Then don't go anywhere.

39:06.712 --> 39:08.545
Thank you.

39:10.349 --> 39:11.348
It's okay, come on.

39:11.350 --> 39:13.917
Tony:
We got a problem.

39:13.919 --> 39:17.687
We found Trent kort's phone
at the zoo, but not Trent kort.

39:17.689 --> 39:20.056
It was a decoy-- he must've
known we were on to him.

39:20.058 --> 39:22.425
He's running.
I can guess where he's going.

39:22.427 --> 39:24.627
Israel.
Tony:
Kort disappeared right
after he learned about Ziva.

39:24.629 --> 39:26.363
He may know about Eli's files.

39:26.365 --> 39:27.831
Kort's probably already been
blackmailed with them.

39:27.833 --> 39:29.366
Gibbs:
McGee, call interpol.

39:29.368 --> 39:31.067
Have them issue a red notice.
DiNozzo.

39:31.069 --> 39:32.635
Tony: Bolos and airports.
Gibbs: Bishop?

39:32.637 --> 39:34.137
Bishop: Freeway cameras
and credit cards.

39:34.139 --> 39:35.472
Contact the Israeli embassy.
See if they know--

39:35.474 --> 39:36.106
whoa, whoa, whoa, boss.

39:36.108 --> 39:37.741
Look at this.

39:39.077 --> 39:41.711
Female reporter: No one has
claimed responsibility

39:41.713 --> 39:43.446
for the explosion
at this isolated farmhouse

39:43.448 --> 39:45.648
in the Israeli countryside.

39:45.650 --> 39:46.916
But with early reports

39:46.918 --> 39:48.985
indicating the house
previously belonged

39:48.987 --> 39:51.554
to former Mossad director
Eli David,

39:51.556 --> 39:53.723
authorities are assuming
a terrorist attack.

39:53.725 --> 39:54.958
Is that...?

39:54.960 --> 39:56.092
Reporter:
Firefighting teams...

39:56.094 --> 39:57.827
...where Ziva's supposed
to be staying.
