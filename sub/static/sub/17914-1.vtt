01:45.867 --> 01:47.533
Greetings, Princess Dyanna.

01:47.533 --> 01:50.200
I hope you had a safe journey.

01:50.200 --> 01:52.200
I am Cassia,

01:52.200 --> 01:54.241
the liaison for your visit.

01:54.241 --> 01:56.075
The Princess is not
used to travelling

01:56.075 --> 01:57.867
in such stormy conditions.

01:57.867 --> 01:59.325
My apologies.

01:59.325 --> 02:01.117
This is our off season.

02:01.117 --> 02:03.658
But the storms
will not interfere

02:03.658 --> 02:06.075
in your vacation here
at Pleasure Station.

02:06.075 --> 02:08.241
Of that I can assure you both.

02:08.241 --> 02:09.908
Tara's my bodyguard,

02:09.908 --> 02:11.575
not my companion.

02:11.575 --> 02:13.200
I see.

02:13.200 --> 02:16.159
Well, we have many activities

02:16.159 --> 02:19.575
to keep your
"body guard" occupied,

02:19.575 --> 02:22.950
while you may entertain
yourself privately.

02:22.950 --> 02:24.783
That won't be necessary.

02:24.783 --> 02:27.159
I would just like to make sure
you know who the client is.

02:27.159 --> 02:29.408
Of course, Princess.

02:29.408 --> 02:31.783
Welcome to Pleasure Station,

02:31.783 --> 02:34.700
where your every fantasy
becomes real.

02:34.700 --> 02:36.408
Doesn't look very inviting.

02:36.408 --> 02:39.241
This is merely our greeting bay.

02:39.241 --> 02:41.241
I assure you
the rest of the station

02:41.241 --> 02:43.408
will be much more
to your liking.

02:43.408 --> 02:45.491
The Princess has
very specific needs.

02:45.491 --> 02:47.117
We called ahead.

02:47.117 --> 02:50.783
I understand the Princesses
desires completely.

02:50.783 --> 02:54.159
All preparations have been
made as requested.

02:54.159 --> 02:57.700
And if I can personally

02:57.700 --> 03:00.200
be of any assistance,

03:00.200 --> 03:03.658
please don't hesitate
to call upon me.

03:03.658 --> 03:05.491
That won't be necessary.

03:05.491 --> 03:08.325
I will attend to
any of the Princesses needs.

03:08.325 --> 03:10.325
Tara, I can speak for myself.

03:10.325 --> 03:11.950
Of course, Princess.

03:11.950 --> 03:14.117
It's your security
I'm most concerned for.

03:14.117 --> 03:17.491
I understand, but please know,

03:17.491 --> 03:19.450
the Pleasure Station has one of

03:19.450 --> 03:22.450
the largest security forces
in the sector.

03:22.450 --> 03:25.408
You have
absolutely nothing to fear.

03:25.408 --> 03:27.075
Thank you, Cassia.

03:27.075 --> 03:29.075
Tara is paid to worry about me.

03:29.075 --> 03:31.075
Now, I'd like to
get on with my vacation.

03:31.075 --> 03:32.658
Time here is short.

03:32.658 --> 03:34.617
As you wish, Princess.

03:34.617 --> 03:37.450
Please follow me.

03:37.450 --> 03:40.491
Oh, and I hope you

03:40.491 --> 03:43.825
didn't bring a swim suit.

03:47.241 --> 03:50.117
There's something
about her that I don't like.

03:50.117 --> 03:52.075
How do we know
we can trust her?

03:52.075 --> 03:54.283
Tara, you're always
so suspicious.

03:54.283 --> 03:56.325
She's just an employee.

03:56.325 --> 03:58.700
Every time an attractive woman
comes around,

03:58.700 --> 04:00.700
out come your claws.

04:00.700 --> 04:02.700
It's not that, your highness.

04:02.700 --> 04:04.825
It's just...

04:04.825 --> 04:06.825
There's something
about her.

04:06.825 --> 04:08.783
I feel like
I've seen her before.

04:08.783 --> 04:11.241
I'd like to see more of her.

04:11.241 --> 04:13.867
But for now,
put your suspicions aside

04:13.867 --> 04:15.867
and let me enjoy myself.

04:15.867 --> 04:17.867
Of course, Princess.

04:17.867 --> 04:19.533
I hear the pleasure droids

04:19.533 --> 04:21.658
of Exter are
like none other.

04:21.658 --> 04:23.075
Let's find out.

09:46.117 --> 09:48.533
Master.

09:48.533 --> 09:50.783
Is everything ready as planned?

09:50.783 --> 09:53.408
Yes, Aria, standing by.

09:53.408 --> 09:55.658
And the Princess is here?

09:55.658 --> 09:57.450
She is.

09:57.450 --> 09:59.200
Our intelligence was correct.

09:59.200 --> 10:00.867
And is she alone?

10:00.867 --> 10:02.700
No, master,

10:02.700 --> 10:05.075
she has one body guard with her.

10:05.075 --> 10:07.700
Only one?

10:07.700 --> 10:09.366
How foolish.

10:09.366 --> 10:11.034
Where is she now?

10:11.034 --> 10:13.200
She is in the Venusian grotto,

10:13.200 --> 10:15.742
being "entertained"

10:15.742 --> 10:17.742
by a pleasure droid.

10:17.742 --> 10:20.575
Hmm, excellent.

10:20.575 --> 10:23.825
My fleet is standing by
and prepared to attack.

10:23.825 --> 10:26.241
Soon we will control this station

10:26.241 --> 10:28.241
and create a new outpost

10:28.241 --> 10:30.700
for my Recusa star system.

10:30.700 --> 10:33.034
And the Princess?

10:33.034 --> 10:35.450
Once she becomes our prisoner

10:35.450 --> 10:38.700
no one will dare
retaliate against us.

10:38.700 --> 10:40.533
She is the jewel

10:40.533 --> 10:42.742
in the crown of hostages.

10:42.742 --> 10:44.742
With her in our pocket,

10:44.742 --> 10:47.117
all resistance will cease.

10:47.117 --> 10:49.283
Without her...

10:49.283 --> 10:52.783
Our planet will be destroyed
by the Federation.

10:52.783 --> 10:55.241
That won't happen.

10:55.241 --> 10:57.075
You'll see to that,

10:57.075 --> 10:58.617
won't you?

11:03.909 --> 11:06.950
Your desire is my command.

11:06.950 --> 11:08.491
Start the attack!

11:08.491 --> 11:11.325
Commence attack
on Pleasure Station.

11:11.325 --> 11:13.909
Crush all opposition.

11:13.909 --> 11:16.325
Now, bring me the Princess.

11:24.992 --> 11:28.241
Soon this rotten little asteroid

11:28.241 --> 11:31.742
will be all mine!

11:31.742 --> 11:35.283
Your masseuse awaits you,
Princess.

11:37.117 --> 11:38.575
Good.

11:38.575 --> 11:40.034
I hope she has strong hands.

11:40.034 --> 11:41.617
I could use one after that.

11:44.325 --> 11:45.867
What's that?

11:45.867 --> 11:47.783
Smoke detector?

11:53.241 --> 11:55.159
We're under siege,
your Highness.

11:55.159 --> 11:57.450
Why would anyone attack
the Pleasure Station?

11:57.450 --> 11:59.366
I think it's a plot
to kidnap you.

11:59.366 --> 12:01.491
Kidnap me?

12:01.491 --> 12:04.533
Aria of Electros has always
been a rebel traitor.

12:04.533 --> 12:06.325
I'm sure she's behind this.

12:12.783 --> 12:14.992
Aria? Just my luck.

12:14.992 --> 12:17.450
Caught in an alien whore house
with my pants down.

12:17.450 --> 12:19.034
We've got to get out of here.

12:19.034 --> 12:21.034
Come on, let's try
the loading dock.

12:21.034 --> 12:22.867
Maybe we can hijack
an escape shuttle.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.700
Okay.

12:32.533 --> 12:36.159
These space pimps are no match
for my skilled pilots.

12:36.159 --> 12:38.408
This won't last long.

12:41.366 --> 12:44.742
Hurry, we don't have much time!

12:44.742 --> 12:46.575
But do you think this thing

12:46.575 --> 12:48.075
will actually fly?

12:48.075 --> 12:50.075
There's only one way
to find out.

12:50.075 --> 12:52.366
But do you really
know how to fly this thing?

12:52.366 --> 12:54.366
Does it really matter
at this point?

12:54.366 --> 12:57.200
All right, here we go.

13:00.034 --> 13:02.700
Fingers crossed.
We got incoming.

13:05.533 --> 13:07.992
Well, at least if it's
my time to perish,

13:07.992 --> 13:10.825
I died after being licked senseless
by an android hooker.

13:10.825 --> 13:12.575
Don't talk like that.

13:12.575 --> 13:16.034
We're not gonna die...
I hope.

13:19.325 --> 13:22.366
There's one coming right at us.

13:22.366 --> 13:25.117
Oh, no... ah.

13:29.408 --> 13:31.408
We've got one left behind us.

13:31.408 --> 13:33.283
I don't think I can shake him.

13:38.533 --> 13:42.117
Hey, pal, tailgating is illegal
in this quadrant.

13:45.950 --> 13:47.783
Good job, Princess.

13:47.783 --> 13:50.075
But we're headed straight
towards that asteroid belt.

13:53.325 --> 13:54.992
It's our only chance.

13:54.992 --> 13:57.450
Do you think we can out
maneuver them without killing us?

13:57.450 --> 14:00.283
Are you crazy?
I don't know how to fly this thing.

14:00.283 --> 14:02.283
Then let's just close our eyes.

14:17.700 --> 14:19.783
We've slowed down.

14:19.783 --> 14:22.159
Does that mean we've entered
a friendly solar system

14:22.159 --> 14:24.159
where we'll we welcomed
and meet new friends

14:24.159 --> 14:27.159
who will protect us
from Aria's evil plans to kidnap me?

14:27.159 --> 14:28.783
Um, no.

14:28.783 --> 14:30.617
It means
the engine's on fire.

14:30.617 --> 14:32.617
Damn it! Now what?

14:32.617 --> 14:34.450
We only have one choice.

14:34.450 --> 14:36.325
We have to
jettison ourselves

14:36.325 --> 14:37.992
off of this ship

14:37.992 --> 14:39.366
and take our chances.

14:39.366 --> 14:41.366
Chances, but where?

14:41.366 --> 14:43.491
There's a planet,
straight ahead.

14:49.617 --> 14:52.491
Where is she?

14:52.491 --> 14:54.325
I don't know.

14:54.325 --> 14:56.825
They must have found
a way to escape.

14:56.825 --> 14:58.491
How is that possible?

14:58.491 --> 15:00.950
We have the place surrounded.

15:00.950 --> 15:04.658
Perhaps they stole
one of the escape shuttles.

15:04.658 --> 15:07.491
Eluding my trained fighters?

15:07.491 --> 15:09.825
I don't believe it.

15:09.825 --> 15:11.825
I'm afraid it's true, Aria.

15:11.825 --> 15:14.992
We've had reports of
one small ship slipping through.

15:14.992 --> 15:16.992
It must be them.

15:16.992 --> 15:18.783
Do you know what this means?

15:18.783 --> 15:23.700
That I won't be vacationing
in Qualitron next week.

15:23.700 --> 15:27.533
When they find out we don't have
the Princess held hostage,

15:27.533 --> 15:30.241
our asses won't
be worth a plug nickel.

15:30.241 --> 15:33.034
What do we do?

15:33.034 --> 15:36.658
You've got to find her
and bring her to me.

15:36.658 --> 15:40.325
In the meantime, I'll pretend
as if we really do have her.

15:40.325 --> 15:43.325
That should stall off
a counter attack for now.

15:43.325 --> 15:45.366
But you need to hurry.

15:45.366 --> 15:47.533
I can't get busted again.

15:47.533 --> 15:49.867
I'm on my third strike.

15:49.867 --> 15:53.867
I'll do my best, master.

15:53.867 --> 15:57.700
All royal family members have
an implanted tracking chip in them.

15:57.700 --> 16:01.075
Use that and
it'll lead you right to her.

16:21.283 --> 16:23.909
Isn't this amazing?
Just look at it.

16:23.909 --> 16:25.742
Let me guess.

16:25.742 --> 16:27.241
45 hundred new numbers

16:27.241 --> 16:28.742
you've never seen before.

16:28.742 --> 16:30.992
Better than that, 48 hundred.

16:30.992 --> 16:33.617
Every day I send dozens of
messages out into space.

16:33.617 --> 16:36.075
Every day, I wait for
someone to answer back.

16:36.075 --> 16:39.075
Collect call from Uranus
on line two.

16:39.075 --> 16:41.909
You're killing me, Jake.

16:41.909 --> 16:43.867
I know to you
this is all trivial.

16:43.867 --> 16:45.617
But to me this is important.

16:45.617 --> 16:47.617
I know something is gonna happen,
something big.

16:47.617 --> 16:52.117
I haven't seen anything big
from you in days.

16:52.117 --> 16:54.950
Suzi, I'll make time
for you this weekend.

16:54.950 --> 16:57.408
But right now,
I've gotta wait to see if someone in

16:57.408 --> 17:00.117
the outer reaches of space
wants to instant message me.

17:00.117 --> 17:03.575
Trust me, babe,
E.T. is not phoning home.

17:03.575 --> 17:07.282
If you're bored, why don't you
just go home, call it a day?

17:07.282 --> 17:09.282
It's not that I'm bored, Jake.

17:09.282 --> 17:12.617
The only time I get to see you
is when I hang out here.

17:12.617 --> 17:14.117
That's not true.

17:14.117 --> 17:15.617
We do live together.

17:15.617 --> 17:17.450
No we don't.

17:17.450 --> 17:19.909
I live in a big house
with a big comfy bed.

17:19.909 --> 17:22.950
And you live... here,

17:22.950 --> 17:24.700
in UFO central.

17:24.700 --> 17:28.575
The search for extraterrestrial life
is a thankless one,

17:28.575 --> 17:30.450
but it's my job.

17:30.450 --> 17:33.325
To look for UFO's
where there are none?

17:33.325 --> 17:35.325
I wish you could see
how important this is.

17:35.325 --> 17:37.159
If I were to actually
make contact

17:37.159 --> 17:39.992
with an honest to god UFO,
I'd be famous.

17:39.992 --> 17:41.658
I could write my own ticket to

17:41.658 --> 17:44.159
the top of the scientific slog heap.

17:44.159 --> 17:46.159
I know, I know,
it's just you spend

17:46.159 --> 17:48.825
so much time studying
the heavenly bodies.

17:48.825 --> 17:50.658
What about me?

17:50.658 --> 17:52.617
What about this body?

17:52.617 --> 17:54.241
You know I can't concentrate

17:54.241 --> 17:55.867
when you do that.

17:57.366 --> 17:59.366
Well...

17:59.366 --> 18:01.825
how about now?

18:01.825 --> 18:03.825
Is this better?

18:03.825 --> 18:05.909
Suzi...

18:07.408 --> 18:09.617
Come on, baby.

18:09.617 --> 18:11.617
I want your rocket,

18:11.617 --> 18:14.491
and I want it to
blast off right now.

18:15.700 --> 18:17.700
You know, sometimes,

18:17.700 --> 18:20.742
you can be very persuasive.

18:20.742 --> 18:23.950
I want you to produce
a real UFO,

18:23.950 --> 18:27.992
an unbelievable fucking orgasm.

18:27.992 --> 18:31.200
I think I see one
coming right now.

24:22.617 --> 24:24.617
What's that?

24:24.617 --> 24:27.159
It's probably the microwave,
come on.

24:29.200 --> 24:31.159
That's the atmospheric
disturbance meter.

24:31.159 --> 24:34.200
Something's causing a ripple
in the upper stratosphere.

24:34.200 --> 24:37.200
You don't think...

24:38.783 --> 24:40.617
Uh, it could be.

24:40.617 --> 24:42.241
It looks like

24:42.241 --> 24:44.909
something's trying to
break into our orbit.

24:44.909 --> 24:47.700
A UFO? Please!

24:47.700 --> 24:50.575
Maybe, I have
the server co-ordinates.

24:50.575 --> 24:52.575
You do that.

24:52.575 --> 24:54.575
I'm stepping outside.

24:54.575 --> 24:57.742
Suzi, you smoke after sex?

24:57.742 --> 25:00.200
I don't know.
I never looked.

25:08.491 --> 25:10.491
We must transport
to the surface.

25:10.491 --> 25:12.950
But we must do it quickly.
Hold me tight.

25:12.950 --> 25:15.325
Not now, Tara.
Can't we do that later.

25:15.325 --> 25:18.325
No, hold me tight, so we can
transport together, quickly!

25:18.325 --> 25:20.325
Oh, right.
Okay, I'm ready.

25:39.575 --> 25:41.241
Holy shit!

25:51.325 --> 25:53.325
Well, that could
have been worse.

25:53.325 --> 25:55.950
If only I knew where we were.

25:55.950 --> 25:58.533
What a strange place this is.

26:00.117 --> 26:01.658
Look!

26:02.825 --> 26:05.491
Well, that's just great.

26:05.491 --> 26:08.533
There goes our wheels.

26:11.159 --> 26:12.700
Suggestions?

26:12.700 --> 26:15.325
We need to find food and shelter,

26:15.325 --> 26:17.366
and a place to pee.

26:17.366 --> 26:19.658
Do you have a device that
will help us do such a thing?

26:19.658 --> 26:21.658
Yes, your highness.

26:25.533 --> 26:28.034
Heads.

26:28.034 --> 26:29.867
This way.

26:36.034 --> 26:38.491
Jake, I saw it, I saw it!

26:38.491 --> 26:39.867
Saw what?

26:39.867 --> 26:41.700
The UFO, or whatever it is.

26:41.700 --> 26:43.617
Where?

26:43.617 --> 26:45.867
It was falling from the sky,
and it was on fire,

26:45.867 --> 26:47.992
and it blew up
when it hit the hills.

26:47.992 --> 26:49.408
Blew up?

26:49.408 --> 26:51.241
Yeah, ka-pow!

26:51.241 --> 26:53.658
Nothing, nothing but smoke.

26:53.658 --> 26:56.491
I'm pretty sure
all you saw was a meteorite.

26:56.491 --> 26:58.034
It happens all the time.

26:58.034 --> 27:00.325
But in broad daylight?

27:00.325 --> 27:02.283
Well, that's unlikely,

27:02.283 --> 27:04.575
but it's probably all is was.

27:04.575 --> 27:06.450
Too bad.

27:06.450 --> 27:08.491
I was really hoping for more.

27:08.491 --> 27:11.241
Jake, this was no shooting star.

27:11.241 --> 27:14.408
You're right, let's go home.

27:14.408 --> 27:16.283
I can't any more of this today.

27:16.283 --> 27:20.283
Okay, but don't give up, babe.

27:20.283 --> 27:22.283
The truth is out there.

27:22.283 --> 27:24.117
Thank you.

27:50.617 --> 27:53.450
You can run through
a million star systems,

27:53.450 --> 27:56.450
but you can't hid from me,
little Princess.

28:02.450 --> 28:05.117
Cassia to Master Aria, come in.

28:05.117 --> 28:07.575
I've located the Princess
on the third planet

28:07.575 --> 28:09.950
in the star of Braxis.

28:09.950 --> 28:12.950
Come in. Aria?

28:14.200 --> 28:16.241
Hello?

28:17.950 --> 28:19.950
What is she doing?

35:19.408 --> 35:21.408
Look, Princess.

35:21.408 --> 35:22.867
Praise Targas!

35:22.867 --> 35:24.867
Perhaps we can
take shelter there.

35:24.867 --> 35:26.867
It's a primitive construction.

35:26.867 --> 35:28.909
Not much curb appeal,

35:28.909 --> 35:30.408
but we're in no position

35:30.408 --> 35:31.950
to be choosy.

35:31.950 --> 35:34.159
It will allow us
to regroup our thoughts

35:34.159 --> 35:36.034
and plan our next move.

35:36.034 --> 35:38.617
But what if
we encounter an alien race?

35:38.617 --> 35:41.075
Let me do the talking.

35:41.075 --> 35:43.700
Got it.

36:05.450 --> 36:08.075
Time to put this baby
on auto pilot

36:08.075 --> 36:10.325
and do a little hooter hunting.

36:11.742 --> 36:14.117
Auto pilot activated.

36:43.075 --> 36:45.450
What place is this?

36:45.450 --> 36:48.075
It looks like
a food storage facility.

36:48.075 --> 36:49.366
A kitchen?

36:49.366 --> 36:51.034
Yes, are you hungry?

36:51.034 --> 36:52.867
I could eat a mahar.

36:54.159 --> 36:57.325
Hmm... what is this?

36:57.325 --> 37:00.325
It looks like my cousin.

37:00.325 --> 37:03.783
Ah, look Princess.

37:03.783 --> 37:07.117
Good work, Tara. Let's eat.

37:11.325 --> 37:13.825
Agent Daniels, come on in.

37:13.825 --> 37:15.658
You asked to see me, sir?

37:15.658 --> 37:17.992
Yeah, take a seat there.

37:25.117 --> 37:29.325
What can you tell me about
the UFO tracking station

37:29.325 --> 37:31.450
at Santa Mira Springs?

37:31.450 --> 37:33.867
Well, to be honest, not much.

37:33.867 --> 37:35.867
It's been pretty hush-hush.

37:35.867 --> 37:37.867
Sparsely maintained.

37:37.867 --> 37:40.533
No tangible results from
the center have been reported,

37:40.533 --> 37:42.992
at least,
none that I'm aware of.

37:42.992 --> 37:45.075
Until now.

37:45.075 --> 37:47.366
Until now?

37:47.366 --> 37:50.366
Intell has it that something big

37:50.366 --> 37:52.575
came out of the sky there,

37:52.575 --> 37:55.200
and crashed, today.

37:55.200 --> 37:57.825
The problem is, I haven't heard

37:57.825 --> 38:00.034
anything from the center.

38:00.034 --> 38:02.034
That's strange.

38:02.034 --> 38:04.533
Do you have any idea
what it was?

38:04.533 --> 38:07.034
Not at all.

38:07.034 --> 38:10.450
But there's also reports
that something strange

38:10.450 --> 38:14.909
entered our orbit within
a half hour of the crash.

38:14.909 --> 38:18.117
Something totally unexplained.

38:18.117 --> 38:20.034
And you'd like me
to go check it out.

38:20.034 --> 38:22.867
Right, I've been trying to
get a hold of Jake Johnson.

38:22.867 --> 38:25.825
He's the scientist who runs
the center up there,

38:25.825 --> 38:27.825
but no luck so far.

38:27.825 --> 38:29.241
Now, I don't know.

38:29.241 --> 38:31.909
Maybe he didn't come in today.

38:31.909 --> 38:34.658
Maybe he took the afternoon off
and went home.

38:34.658 --> 38:36.241
I just don't know.

38:36.241 --> 38:37.783
Got it.

38:37.783 --> 38:39.783
I'll go visit the center.

38:39.783 --> 38:41.533
Negative, agent.
I want you to go

38:41.533 --> 38:43.034
straight out to his house.

38:43.034 --> 38:44.575
He's very isolated.

38:44.575 --> 38:46.200
There's no cell phone.

38:46.200 --> 38:48.159
There's no computer, nothing.

38:48.159 --> 38:50.575
But I think he's our best hope.

38:50.575 --> 38:52.575
If he's out there, sir,

38:52.575 --> 38:55.075
I'll find him.

38:55.075 --> 38:57.992
And, Daniels,
if you do find him,

38:57.992 --> 38:59.992
and he knows something,

38:59.992 --> 39:02.783
I'm depending on you
to keep it zipped.

39:02.783 --> 39:05.825
You can count on me, sir.

39:05.825 --> 39:07.783
Good.

39:09.366 --> 39:10.783
What?

39:27.283 --> 39:29.117
Why's the door open?

39:29.117 --> 39:30.491
I don't know.

39:31.950 --> 39:33.783
Do you smell that?

39:33.783 --> 39:35.783
Yeah, did you leave
the oven on again?

39:35.783 --> 39:37.825
Of course not.

39:54.325 --> 39:55.825
What the hell is going on here?

39:55.825 --> 39:58.159
Greetings, Earthlings. How?

39:58.159 --> 40:00.117
How?

40:00.117 --> 40:02.783
Earthlings? I think maybe
you better start explaining.

40:02.783 --> 40:05.075
Well, we got lost...

40:05.075 --> 40:07.117
Lost, just completely lost.

40:07.117 --> 40:09.117
And we came upon
your construction.

40:09.117 --> 40:10.491
Beautiful place.

40:10.491 --> 40:12.159
Really nice.

40:12.159 --> 40:13.783
And no one was here.

40:13.783 --> 40:15.366
Not a soul.

40:15.366 --> 40:18.783
So we thought,
maybe you wouldn't mind?

40:18.783 --> 40:20.450
Is it okay?

40:20.450 --> 40:22.700
We can leave.
It's not a problem.

40:22.700 --> 40:24.325
I'm just so confused.

40:24.325 --> 40:25.909
Your clothes?

40:25.909 --> 40:27.867
Everything is just so strange.

40:27.867 --> 40:29.867
Are you guys from Centerville?

40:29.867 --> 40:31.533
I got dressed in a hurry.

40:31.533 --> 40:33.075
I was being kidnapped.

40:33.075 --> 40:34.575
Kidnapped?

40:34.575 --> 40:36.783
Yes, you are addressing
Her Royal Highness,

40:36.783 --> 40:38.617
Princess Dyanna of Alton Four.

40:38.617 --> 40:40.034
And I am her

40:40.034 --> 40:41.366
body guard, Tara.

40:41.366 --> 40:43.283
You're kidding me, right?

40:43.283 --> 40:44.742
I don't kid.

40:52.366 --> 40:54.742
Suzi, do you think it could be?

40:54.742 --> 40:57.034
Oh, that thing that
crashed in the hills.

40:57.034 --> 40:58.742
No, this is fantastic.

40:58.742 --> 41:00.617
This is what
I've always dreamed about.

41:00.617 --> 41:02.450
I can't believe it.

41:02.450 --> 41:04.408
I mean,
they do look pretty fantastic.

41:04.408 --> 41:05.783
All right.

41:05.783 --> 41:07.117
Oh, my God.

41:07.117 --> 41:10.950
Okay, ladies,
please finish your meal

41:10.950 --> 41:14.117
and we can have
a little chat... please.

41:19.034 --> 41:21.617
Suzi, do you know
what this means?

41:21.617 --> 41:24.034
That two big-tittied twits
cleaned out our kitchen

41:24.034 --> 41:26.241
and now we have to go
grocery shopping.

41:26.241 --> 41:28.241
No, I mean, what if they

41:28.241 --> 41:30.241
really did come
on a space ship

41:30.241 --> 41:32.241
here from another galaxy?

41:32.241 --> 41:35.075
You really think either one of
those two has the intelligence

41:35.075 --> 41:37.075
to find their way out of
a K-Mart parking lot?

41:37.075 --> 41:38.909
Stranger things have happened.

41:38.909 --> 41:40.325
Name one.

41:40.325 --> 41:41.950
All right, let me start again.

41:41.950 --> 41:43.825
What if they're
telling the truth?

41:43.825 --> 41:46.034
Maybe they did escape
from outer space.

41:46.034 --> 41:49.034
They look like they escaped
from a Frederick's Catalogue.

41:49.034 --> 41:51.075
Either way, it's not bad.

41:51.075 --> 41:53.075
There's only one way
I can prove it.

41:53.075 --> 41:54.658
I need to test their clothes.

41:54.658 --> 41:56.283
I'll bet they're made of fabric

41:56.283 --> 41:57.909
that's not of this Earth.

41:57.909 --> 41:59.950
How are we supposed
to get their clothes?

41:59.950 --> 42:03.325
You're a girl.
Think of something.

42:03.325 --> 42:05.325
What...?

42:07.117 --> 42:08.909
This is our room.

42:08.909 --> 42:10.783
You can change in here.

42:10.783 --> 42:14.200
So, please explain to me again
why you guys want my clothes.

42:14.200 --> 42:16.617
Well, if you really are
from another solar system,

42:16.617 --> 42:19.408
the fabric of the clothes
will prove it's alien composition.

42:19.408 --> 42:21.450
I have to study it,
run some tests.

42:21.450 --> 42:23.117
All right, if it proves

42:23.117 --> 42:24.867
that we're telling the truth.

42:24.867 --> 42:26.366
You could borrow some of

42:26.366 --> 42:27.867
my stuff while he runs tests.

42:27.867 --> 42:29.867
I'll let you ladies
sort things out.

42:29.867 --> 42:31.867
Take your time.

42:37.491 --> 42:39.325
Do you need some help?

42:39.325 --> 42:41.450
Yeah.

42:50.491 --> 42:52.700
Your hands are so soft.

42:55.117 --> 42:56.950
You're really beautiful.

42:56.950 --> 42:58.742
You think so?

42:58.742 --> 43:01.533
Not many people
see me like this.

43:01.533 --> 43:03.366
I'm the royal body guard

43:03.366 --> 43:07.200
and I'm not allowed to
indulge in such things.

43:10.533 --> 43:13.700
Nobody's ever touched you
like this before?

43:13.700 --> 43:17.366
No, but I've seen it
many times.

43:17.366 --> 43:20.159
Maybe we should

43:20.159 --> 43:23.200
do a little experiment
of our own.

43:29.117 --> 43:31.159
Okay.

50:01.491 --> 50:04.366
MIB headquarters,
this is Agent Daniels.

50:04.366 --> 50:06.366
Paging for General Randall.

50:06.366 --> 50:08.783
Come in. I'm at the location.

50:08.783 --> 50:12.450
MIB headquarters, come in.

50:12.450 --> 50:14.825
Why am I not surprised?

50:37.950 --> 50:40.783
Please,
make yourself comfortable.

50:40.783 --> 50:42.783
Thank you.

50:44.366 --> 50:47.200
Whoa!
That's not what I meant.

50:47.200 --> 50:48.700
Hmm...

50:48.700 --> 50:50.950
You're a very mysterious creature.

50:50.950 --> 50:53.117
Your intentions confuse me.

50:53.117 --> 50:56.117
I've never seen a species
quite like you before.

50:56.117 --> 50:58.283
You mean a man?

50:58.283 --> 51:00.159
You've never seen a man before?

51:00.159 --> 51:02.825
No, they do not have them
where I come from.

51:02.825 --> 51:05.825
But I think it may be
very important now.

51:05.825 --> 51:07.325
Why is that?

51:07.325 --> 51:08.867
Because our ship
has been destroyed.

51:08.867 --> 51:10.408
We have no way
of returning home.

51:10.408 --> 51:12.159
Good point.

51:35.575 --> 51:37.783
We must now learn
to fit into your world,

51:37.783 --> 51:39.783
to become a part of it,

51:39.783 --> 51:43.783
to do as you do,
to feel as you feel,

51:43.783 --> 51:47.533
to love as you love.

51:47.533 --> 51:49.992
I'm sure you'll be able
to fit in quickly.

51:49.992 --> 51:52.366
You've just got to learn how
to live in a world full of men.

51:52.366 --> 51:55.366
Of course,
and you will teach me, yes?

51:55.366 --> 51:57.200
Yes.

51:57.200 --> 51:59.034
I mean, no!

51:59.034 --> 52:00.867
You're a Princess, aren't you?

52:00.867 --> 52:02.700
I'm just your
every day UFO hunter.

52:02.700 --> 52:04.700
Besides,
Suzi's right down the hall.

52:04.700 --> 52:07.533
She majored
in castration in college.

52:07.533 --> 52:09.575
Don't worry about Suzi.

52:09.575 --> 52:11.366
Tara can handle her.

52:11.366 --> 52:12.992
But now I would like to know

52:12.992 --> 52:15.783
what men do for their mates
here on Earth.

52:15.783 --> 52:19.241
Well, for the sake
of scientific research.

56:46.241 --> 56:49.241
MIB headquarters, come in.
This is Agent Daniels.

56:49.241 --> 56:51.034
Paging for General Randall.

56:51.034 --> 56:52.867
MIB headquarters, come in.

56:52.867 --> 56:55.450
Cease communications, Earthling.

56:57.325 --> 57:01.325
Drop it.

57:01.325 --> 57:03.742
Hold on a second, beautiful.

57:03.742 --> 57:06.783
Okay, I'm sure
we can talk about this.

57:06.783 --> 57:09.075
Who are you communicating with?

57:09.075 --> 57:11.075
My boss.

57:11.075 --> 57:13.700
I was just checking in.

57:13.700 --> 57:15.700
You know,
they get worried about me

57:15.700 --> 57:18.366
down at headquarters
if they don't hear from me.

57:18.366 --> 57:21.408
Sounds like you've got
a lot to be worried about.

57:21.408 --> 57:23.617
Wait a minute.

57:23.617 --> 57:26.825
One more step,
and I'll vaporize you,

57:26.825 --> 57:30.034
Phew, well, we won't
want that now, would we?

57:30.034 --> 57:32.075
You wouldn't.

57:32.075 --> 57:34.075
Look, it's pretty obvious you're

57:34.075 --> 57:37.075
one of those alien things, okay?

57:37.075 --> 57:39.867
But you need me.
I can help.

57:39.867 --> 57:43.366
I don't know what kind
of creature you are,

57:43.366 --> 57:46.909
but I'm certain that there's
nothing you could do for me.

57:46.909 --> 57:48.533
Don't be so sure.

57:51.408 --> 57:53.783
I saw the Princess

57:53.783 --> 57:56.575
engaging in some
physical contact with

57:56.575 --> 57:59.408
the other of your kind.

57:59.408 --> 58:02.408
What was it?

58:02.408 --> 58:04.825
Oh, that.

58:04.825 --> 58:08.742
Yeah, let's just say
he was integrating her

58:08.742 --> 58:12.575
into one of
Earth's oldest customs.

58:12.575 --> 58:17.408
It looked very...
interesting.

58:17.408 --> 58:19.992
I would like you to show me

58:19.992 --> 58:22.742
this contact.

58:22.742 --> 58:24.992
You want me to show you?

58:24.992 --> 58:26.825
Okay.

58:26.825 --> 58:29.867
But, why don't we start by you

58:29.867 --> 58:31.867
not pointing that thing at me?

58:31.867 --> 58:36.617
Okay, but no funny business.

58:36.617 --> 58:39.408
Hey, no funny business.

01:03:47.283 --> 01:03:50.117
Cassia, this is Aria.

01:03:50.117 --> 01:03:51.950
Come in.

01:03:53.742 --> 01:03:56.366
Cassia,

01:03:56.366 --> 01:03:58.783
this is Aria.

01:03:58.783 --> 01:04:01.783
Answer me!

01:04:01.783 --> 01:04:04.783
I hate playing phone tag!

01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:11.742
No, I want you to get me
the stainless steel ones.

01:04:11.742 --> 01:04:14.117
You know, the ones with
the fur on the inside.

01:04:14.117 --> 01:04:15.533
Yeah.

01:04:15.533 --> 01:04:17.575
Look, I'm gonna have to
call you back, okay?

01:04:17.575 --> 01:04:19.034
General Randall?

01:04:19.034 --> 01:04:20.533
Daniels, where the hell
have you been?!

01:04:20.533 --> 01:04:22.034
I thought you weren't
coming back.

01:04:22.034 --> 01:04:24.450
It's a long, long story, sir.

01:04:24.450 --> 01:04:25.867
But I have big news.

01:04:25.867 --> 01:04:27.200
You were right.

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:28.617
Something did crash

01:04:28.617 --> 01:04:29.950
in those hills.

01:04:29.950 --> 01:04:31.200
I knew it!

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:34.117
It was an alien space craft.

01:04:34.117 --> 01:04:36.491
Now, unfortunately,
the ship's totaled.

01:04:36.491 --> 01:04:39.533
But the occupants were
able to bail out in time.

01:04:39.533 --> 01:04:41.950
Where are they?

01:04:41.950 --> 01:04:44.742
They're at Jake's house,
just like you suspected.

01:04:44.742 --> 01:04:46.742
Two of them, women.

01:04:46.742 --> 01:04:48.325
One's a Princess,

01:04:48.325 --> 01:04:49.950
and the other's her body guard.

01:04:49.950 --> 01:04:52.034
Fantastic!

01:04:52.034 --> 01:04:54.159
Are they friendly?

01:04:54.159 --> 01:04:57.617
Oh, yes, they're very friendly.

01:04:57.617 --> 01:04:59.700
But without their spacecraft,

01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:01.825
they're stranded here on Earth.

01:05:01.825 --> 01:05:04.034
That's an incredible story.

01:05:04.034 --> 01:05:07.200
Are you sure every word
of this is true, Daniels?

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:08.825
I'm positive.

01:05:08.825 --> 01:05:11.159
In fact, I brought you proof.

01:05:19.241 --> 01:05:22.159
This is Cassia.

01:05:22.159 --> 01:05:24.533
Is she one of them?

01:05:24.533 --> 01:05:26.992
Oh, she's one of them.

01:05:26.992 --> 01:05:28.200
Incredible.

01:05:31.867 --> 01:05:34.575
I thought you said
there were two.

01:05:34.575 --> 01:05:37.034
Two on the ship that crashed.

01:05:37.034 --> 01:05:39.658
Cassia was actually
sent here on a mission

01:05:39.658 --> 01:05:41.867
to capture the Princess.

01:05:41.867 --> 01:05:43.408
Incredible!

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:51.867
But, she's changed her mind.

01:05:51.867 --> 01:05:53.700
Haven't you, dear?

01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:55.200
Yes, darling.

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:56.575
I never

01:05:56.575 --> 01:05:58.117
want to go back.

01:05:58.117 --> 01:05:59.700
What changed her mind?

01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:03.117
It's, it's actually all
in the report, sir.

01:06:03.117 --> 01:06:07.075
Let's just say we found
a common ground.

01:06:07.075 --> 01:06:10.450
And ground it
and ground it.

01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:12.992
She's kind of my girlfriend now.

01:06:12.992 --> 01:06:15.200
Yeah, uh...

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:16.783
I can see that.

01:06:16.783 --> 01:06:18.075
We better wrap this all up.

01:06:18.075 --> 01:06:19.867
We better bet them to D.C.

01:06:19.867 --> 01:06:21.825
The President's gonna want to
know about this right away.

01:06:21.825 --> 01:06:23.450
Yes, sir.

01:06:23.450 --> 01:06:25.450
Come on, babe.

01:06:32.867 --> 01:06:35.533
On the deck?

01:06:44.325 --> 01:06:46.742
Jake, I've been looking
everywhere for you.

01:06:46.742 --> 01:06:48.617
Suzi.

01:06:48.617 --> 01:06:50.450
Whoa!

01:06:50.450 --> 01:06:52.450
You look different.

01:06:52.450 --> 01:06:54.034
Do you like it?

01:06:54.034 --> 01:06:57.408
It's very...
ordinary.

01:06:57.408 --> 01:07:00.408
Don't worry. You look great.
You're gonna fit right in.

01:07:01.491 --> 01:07:03.117
Here you go.

01:07:03.117 --> 01:07:04.950
I think you'll
find the make up

01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:07.658
of the material
to be very...

01:07:07.658 --> 01:07:09.491
flexible.

01:07:09.491 --> 01:07:11.491
Excellent.

01:07:11.491 --> 01:07:13.241
Did you find anything out

01:07:13.241 --> 01:07:14.950
new about the Princess?

01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:16.491
A few things.

01:07:16.491 --> 01:07:17.950
Me too.

01:07:20.575 --> 01:07:23.575
So, ladies, I'm gonna have to

01:07:23.575 --> 01:07:25.658
tell someone about
your situation.

01:07:25.658 --> 01:07:27.491
They might be able to help you.

01:07:27.491 --> 01:07:28.825
That's very kind of you.

01:07:28.825 --> 01:07:30.658
I'm pretty certain
that we're being tracked

01:07:30.658 --> 01:07:32.450
by an evil hunter
named Cassia.

01:07:32.450 --> 01:07:34.575
She betrayed me
and tried to kill us.

01:07:34.575 --> 01:07:37.450
Then let's go now.

01:07:37.450 --> 01:07:40.742
No one is going anywhere.

01:07:40.742 --> 01:07:43.909
- Damn it!
- Who are you?

01:07:43.909 --> 01:07:45.700
Stop where you are!

01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:48.325
Sorry, folks,

01:07:48.325 --> 01:07:50.992
MIB is taking over from here.

01:07:50.992 --> 01:07:52.366
What's going on?

01:07:52.366 --> 01:07:53.992
We've got orders to bring

01:07:53.992 --> 01:07:55.825
these girls into Washington.

01:07:55.825 --> 01:07:57.825
Don't worry.
Nobody's going to hurt you.

01:07:57.825 --> 01:07:59.325
On whose orders?

01:07:59.325 --> 01:08:01.366
General Randall's orders.

01:08:01.366 --> 01:08:04.658
Oh, why didn't you say so?

01:08:04.658 --> 01:08:07.783
Like to take you two in
for some quick questions.

01:08:07.783 --> 01:08:10.075
Is there somewhere
we can go in private?

01:08:10.075 --> 01:08:13.241
Um, down the hall,
first door on the left.

01:08:13.241 --> 01:08:15.408
Don't worry, girls.

01:08:15.408 --> 01:08:17.241
He won't hurt you.

01:08:17.241 --> 01:08:20.200
He's just a man...
in black.

01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:22.658
I know what to do with a man.

01:08:22.658 --> 01:08:24.366
So do I.

01:08:33.283 --> 01:08:37.158
Um, maybe I should just go
keep an eye on them.

01:14:28.408 --> 01:14:30.783
What's taking everyone so long?

01:14:33.867 --> 01:14:35.241
I don't know,

01:14:35.241 --> 01:14:38.075
but I expect some answers.

01:14:38.075 --> 01:14:41.117
I'll bet you do.

01:14:41.117 --> 01:14:42.950
And I'll give to you.

01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:44.783
But first,

01:14:44.783 --> 01:14:47.742
you ever consider
having a close encounter?

01:14:57.408 --> 01:15:00.909
Hey, pal, tailgating is illegal
in this quadrant.

01:15:00.909 --> 01:15:03.909
I've never seen a species
quite like you before.

01:15:03.909 --> 01:15:05.950
I know what to do with a man.

01:15:09.450 --> 01:15:11.909
Let me do the talking.

01:15:11.909 --> 01:15:14.159
Greetings, Earthlings. How?

01:15:14.159 --> 01:15:16.075
Come on, let's try
the loading dock.

01:15:16.075 --> 01:15:18.075
Maybe we can hijack
an escape shuttle.

01:15:20.992 --> 01:15:22.992
Time to put this baby
on auto-pilot

01:15:22.992 --> 01:15:25.283
and do a little hooter hunting.

01:15:27.575 --> 01:15:31.450
I am Cassia,
the liaison for your visit.

01:15:34.533 --> 01:15:36.825
Cassia, this is Aria.

01:15:36.825 --> 01:15:38.658
Come in.

01:15:38.658 --> 01:15:41.283
Eluding my trained fighters?

01:15:41.283 --> 01:15:43.825
I don't believe it.

01:15:43.825 --> 01:15:46.075
Is everything ready as planned?

01:15:49.159 --> 01:15:52.867
I haven't seen anything big
from you in days.

01:15:52.867 --> 01:15:55.283
That two big-tittied twits
cleaned out our kitchen

01:15:55.283 --> 01:15:57.658
and now we have to go
grocery shopping.

01:15:57.658 --> 01:15:59.617
Yeah, ka-pow!

01:15:59.617 --> 01:16:01.825
Nothing, nothing but smoke.

01:16:04.825 --> 01:16:06.491
To me this is important.

01:16:06.491 --> 01:16:08.742
I know something is gonna happen,
something big.

01:16:08.742 --> 01:16:12.034
Oh, why didn't you say so?

01:16:12.034 --> 01:16:14.034
You mean a man.

01:16:14.034 --> 01:16:16.034
You've never seen a man before?

01:16:19.159 --> 01:16:21.825
MIB headquarters,
this is Agent Daniels.

01:16:21.825 --> 01:16:23.825
Paging for General Randall.

01:16:23.825 --> 01:16:26.366
Yes, they're very friendly.

01:16:26.366 --> 01:16:29.034
But you need me.
I can help.

01:16:45.783 --> 01:16:49.200
What can you tell me about
the UFO tracking station

01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:51.700
at Santa Mira Springs?

01:16:53.533 --> 01:16:55.533
On the deck?
