WEBVTT

01:12.172 --> 01:13.440
[RuPaul] Previously on
All Stars...

01:13.440 --> 01:15.309
For this week's
maxi challenge,

01:15.309 --> 01:18.979
you'll host your own
legendary club night.

01:18.979 --> 01:21.615
[cheers and applause]

01:21.615 --> 01:22.950
You ready to make a club?

01:22.950 --> 01:24.151
Yeah, girl.
I'm so excited.

01:24.151 --> 01:25.752
This looks better
than the Mona Lisa.

01:25.752 --> 01:28.889
Aah! My manicure!
Does this come off?

01:28.889 --> 01:31.892
Fuck.

01:31.892 --> 01:35.562
Honey, welcome to Club Hive.

01:35.562 --> 01:36.596
-Yes!
-Yeah.

01:36.596 --> 01:37.764
Whoo.

01:37.764 --> 01:40.334
-Sell me the garment.
-Sell that garment.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.971
Latrice Royale,
Trinity The Tuck.

01:43.971 --> 01:45.405
Con-drag-ulations.

01:45.405 --> 01:48.342
You are the top two
All Stars of the week.

01:48.342 --> 01:49.609
[applause]
Oh, my God.

01:49.609 --> 01:52.346
I want to be fighting
my way to the top with you.

01:52.346 --> 01:53.780
I'm really good friends
with Valentina.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.182
[Naomi] If friendship is how

01:55.182 --> 01:57.417
we are going to judge
this competition,

01:57.417 --> 01:58.852
I'm going to be
very disappointed.

01:58.852 --> 02:01.755
Latrice Royale,
you're a winner, baby.

02:01.755 --> 02:04.424
I had to choose Valentina.

02:05.425 --> 02:08.061
My dear Valentina,

02:08.061 --> 02:10.497
sashay away.

02:19.539 --> 02:21.942
[laughs]

02:21.942 --> 02:23.076
Oh!

02:23.076 --> 02:24.244
[Latrice] That's the best.

02:24.244 --> 02:26.813
"Ugh! I have to pack.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.882
Love you all, Valentina."

02:28.882 --> 02:30.517
Short and sweet.

02:30.517 --> 02:32.419
So true.

02:32.419 --> 02:37.624
We are mourning the loss
of our dear departed Valentina.

02:37.624 --> 02:38.859
And you know

02:38.859 --> 02:40.460
that is the most expensive
red lipstick she owned.

02:40.460 --> 02:41.762
[all laugh]

02:41.762 --> 02:42.829
[Latrice] It's a little weird

02:42.829 --> 02:44.598
without her energy in the room,

02:44.598 --> 02:48.969
and we miss her whole spirit
of like existence.

02:48.969 --> 02:51.571
That was really
super, super hard,

02:51.571 --> 02:55.475
because Valentina and I
had really bonded on the road,

02:55.475 --> 02:57.110
and then I watched her grow
so much.

02:57.110 --> 03:00.480
She really is
the most passionate queen

03:00.480 --> 03:02.549
I've ever, ever met.

03:02.549 --> 03:04.685
We'll miss her
and her French vanilla fantasy.

03:04.685 --> 03:05.952
French vanilla fantasy.

03:05.952 --> 03:08.588
French vanilla fantasy, honey.

03:08.588 --> 03:11.124
[sighs]
It's just a sigh of relief

03:11.124 --> 03:14.094
I get to continue
in this competition.

03:14.094 --> 03:16.630
-Love you, Valy.
-Love you, Valentina.

03:16.630 --> 03:17.864
Valentina made the most

03:17.864 --> 03:20.867
out of her little Latina,
like, pop star fantasy,

03:20.867 --> 03:23.303
but it was her time to go home.

03:23.303 --> 03:24.805
Goodbye, Valentina.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.807
Mi amor. [laughs]

03:26.807 --> 03:30.010
Miss Trinity,
who did you vote for?

03:31.511 --> 03:33.480
[Trinity] This was
a hard decision.

03:33.480 --> 03:36.283
I decided to vote for Valentina

03:36.283 --> 03:40.053
because even though
we're friends,

03:40.053 --> 03:44.024
Valentina was the weakest.

03:44.024 --> 03:49.696
I have to just say how much
respect I have for both of you.

03:49.696 --> 03:50.997
It seems like
you really judged fairly,

03:50.997 --> 03:53.266
and I really appreciate that.

03:53.266 --> 03:54.901
Don't get me wrong.

03:54.901 --> 03:59.739
Like, my decision to keep you
wasn't to save you.

03:59.739 --> 04:02.309
I already told all y'all
bitches

04:02.309 --> 04:06.313
I want to be in the top
with the best.

04:06.313 --> 04:09.516
And if I'm gonna win,
I want to beat the best.

04:09.516 --> 04:12.552
These are strong bitches here.

04:12.552 --> 04:14.621
The stakes are really high,

04:14.621 --> 04:17.791
and there's no telling
who's going to do what

04:17.791 --> 04:19.326
and who's going
to get the chop next.

04:21.461 --> 04:23.196
I've won twice,

04:23.196 --> 04:24.231
and I've been
in the bottom once.

04:24.231 --> 04:25.599
[Manila] I have been safe--

04:25.599 --> 04:28.268
[Trinity]
No, you've had three wins.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.569
-Three wins.
-And no bottoms.

04:29.569 --> 04:30.904
-And no bottoms.
-Oh, okay.

04:30.904 --> 04:32.572
Bitch.

04:32.572 --> 04:37.144
I've had three wins
and one bottom.

04:37.144 --> 04:38.778
[Monique] At this point
in the competition,

04:38.778 --> 04:41.715
I really--I think that,
you know, Manila and Trinity

04:41.715 --> 04:44.017
are two people who have
been doing steadily well.

04:44.017 --> 04:46.286
And I feel like
they are probably

04:46.286 --> 04:48.054
the two fiercest girls
in the competition.

04:50.190 --> 04:51.758
I think we all
should just realize

04:51.758 --> 04:54.895
that this is
the top six right now.

04:54.895 --> 04:56.229
[Manila] For reals.
[Latrice] For real-real.

04:56.229 --> 04:57.364
I consider
every single one of you guys

04:57.364 --> 04:58.632
competition at this point.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.066
Yeah, yeah, the same.
Next week will be different.

05:00.066 --> 05:01.334
Because I don't know
what this week's challenge

05:01.334 --> 05:02.435
-is going to be.
-Yeah.

05:02.435 --> 05:04.204
I can find myself
in the bottom.

05:04.204 --> 05:06.640
At this point, honey,
anybody can go home next.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.508
So, look, get your mind right,

05:08.508 --> 05:10.177
don't spend your money
on one spot,

05:10.177 --> 05:12.779
and we gotta what?
Be fierce.

05:12.779 --> 05:14.981
Here's the T, girl, okay?

05:14.981 --> 05:16.316
People still want to play fair.

05:16.316 --> 05:19.452
I think that's
the general consensus.

05:19.452 --> 05:21.388
But it's getting closer
to the top four,

05:21.388 --> 05:24.324
and I want to be at the end
with a crown and a scepter,

05:24.324 --> 05:27.360
and I will do whatever it takes
to get there.

05:28.595 --> 05:31.665
Wig coming off.
Ugh. Damn.

Hey, Harvey Girls.

06:40.767 --> 06:43.570
If you want to catch
the Easter Parade,

06:43.570 --> 06:45.205
Meet Me in St. Louis.

06:45.205 --> 06:46.206
Ooh.

06:46.206 --> 06:48.241
Because A Star Is Born,

06:48.241 --> 06:50.010

We're doing something--

06:59.252 --> 07:01.054
-I mean, obviously.
-Obviously.

07:01.054 --> 07:03.623
Hello, hello, hello.

07:03.623 --> 07:05.191
[cheers and applause]

07:05.191 --> 07:08.228
-Colors.
-Lovely.

07:08.228 --> 07:09.329
Hey, All Stars.

07:09.329 --> 07:10.864
Hey, Mom.

07:10.864 --> 07:12.399
Now, this week
we are paying tribute

07:12.399 --> 07:17.037
to one of the greatest stars
Hollywood has ever produced:

07:17.037 --> 07:18.571
Judy Garland.

07:18.571 --> 07:20.273
[cheers and applause]

07:20.273 --> 07:22.475
Judy was a sensitive soul

07:22.475 --> 07:26.146
whose magnificent voice
in classic films

07:26.146 --> 07:28.815
move us till this day.

07:28.815 --> 07:32.319
Now, it's been 50 years
since Judy passed away,

07:32.319 --> 07:36.990
and on the night of her funeral
in June 1969,

07:36.990 --> 07:39.759
the Stonewall riots occurred.

07:39.759 --> 07:41.227
I didn't know
that correlation.

07:41.227 --> 07:42.762
[Trinity]
Wow. I didn't know that either.

07:42.762 --> 07:44.631
[RuPaul] Fed up
with police harassment,

07:44.631 --> 07:46.800
the patrons of the Stonewall

07:46.800 --> 07:49.936
used their grief
over Judy's death

07:49.936 --> 07:52.172
to rise up and fight back,

07:52.172 --> 07:55.075
and the gay liberation movement
was born.

07:55.075 --> 07:57.010
[Latrice] Amen.
[Trinity] Wow.

07:57.010 --> 08:00.447
Now, in the past, asking
"Are you a friend of Dorothy's?"

08:00.447 --> 08:02.549
was a secret code

08:02.549 --> 08:06.252
to help closeted people
identify each other.

08:06.252 --> 08:07.253
[Trinity Really?
[Latrice] Yeah.

08:07.253 --> 08:08.988
And still today,

08:08.988 --> 08:12.559
I call my closest friends
my "Best Judys."

08:12.559 --> 08:14.728
So for this week's
maxi challenge,

08:14.728 --> 08:18.498
you'll be making over
your Best Judys.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.633
-Aah!
-What?

08:20.633 --> 08:22.936
My heart just sank, bitch.

08:22.936 --> 08:25.638
And here they are.

08:25.638 --> 08:30.377
Let's say hello to Naomi's
Best Judy, Ricardo.

08:30.377 --> 08:33.012
Aah!

08:33.012 --> 08:35.815
I clicked my heels
three times and I'm here.

08:35.815 --> 08:39.018
I'm so excited to see Ricardo.

08:39.018 --> 08:40.854
Hi. [laughs]

08:40.854 --> 08:43.156
Oh, he's like
the best person ever.

08:43.156 --> 08:46.526
He has been there since
the birth of Naomi when--

08:46.526 --> 08:50.030
before Naomi was even
using setting powder. Ugh.

08:51.698 --> 08:54.934
Let's say hello
to Monique's Best Judy,

08:54.934 --> 08:56.569
Danny.
Come on out, Danny.

08:56.569 --> 08:58.505
[Monique screams]

09:04.344 --> 09:05.345
[Danny] Everything's
gonna be okay, baby.

09:05.345 --> 09:07.981
-Girl, you got a moustache.
-I do.

09:07.981 --> 09:10.483
Monét's Best Judy, Patty.

09:10.483 --> 09:12.452
[screams] Patty!

09:12.452 --> 09:14.721
You don't call,
you don't text!

09:16.289 --> 09:18.258
Patty!

09:18.258 --> 09:20.460
Everybody's so hairy.

09:20.460 --> 09:23.229
And Latrice's Best Judy, Tim.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.098
No, ma'am, Pam.

09:25.098 --> 09:27.834
Hello, everybody, Latrice.

09:27.834 --> 09:30.070
Aah!

09:32.906 --> 09:35.475
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, fuck.

09:35.475 --> 09:37.977
Trinity's Best Judy, Leo.

09:37.977 --> 09:39.813
[gasps]

09:39.813 --> 09:42.816
Hi, honey, I'm home.

09:42.816 --> 09:46.052
It's my boyfriend.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.388
Aw.

09:48.388 --> 09:49.889
Oh.

09:49.889 --> 09:51.691
[Trinity] Leo really is
my best friend.

09:51.691 --> 09:55.462
He's my partner.
I've missed him so much.

09:55.462 --> 09:56.863
That's so sweet.

09:56.863 --> 09:59.065
[Latrice] All right, now,
PG-13, honey.

09:59.065 --> 10:01.401
I think they're closer friends
than we thought.

10:01.401 --> 10:02.902
[all laugh]
Yeah.

10:02.902 --> 10:05.672
And speaking of close,

10:05.672 --> 10:09.542
Manila's Best Judy,
Michael is here.

10:09.542 --> 10:11.411
Surprise.

10:11.411 --> 10:13.646
Come here!

10:13.646 --> 10:15.381
I love you.

10:15.381 --> 10:17.550
Oh, my God, it's my husband,

10:17.550 --> 10:20.086
my brand-new husband Michael.

10:20.086 --> 10:23.656
Oh, fuck, you guys.

10:23.656 --> 10:25.058
Aw.

10:25.058 --> 10:27.160
-Hi, Michael.
-Ciao, hola.

10:27.160 --> 10:30.964

to transform your Best Judy

10:30.964 --> 10:34.300

Family resemblance required.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.938
Now you can use your own drag,

10:38.938 --> 10:42.575
plus materials
from the F&S fabric wall,

10:42.575 --> 10:45.578
makeup from Anastasia
Beverly Hills,

10:45.578 --> 10:48.414
and hair provided
by Rock Star Wigs.

10:48.414 --> 10:49.782

10:51.985 --> 10:54.153

one more thing.

10:54.153 --> 10:56.122
In addition to your makeovers,

10:56.122 --> 10:58.358
each pair needs
to choreograph and perform

10:58.358 --> 11:02.829
a very special musical tribute
to Judy Garland.

11:02.829 --> 11:06.332
Oh, my God.
[laughter and applause]

11:06.332 --> 11:09.068
Ladies and gentlemen,
start your engines,

11:09.068 --> 11:11.471
and may the Best Judys win.

11:11.471 --> 11:13.172
Yes.

11:13.172 --> 11:16.142
[laughter and applause]

11:16.142 --> 11:17.277
All right.

11:17.277 --> 11:19.445
Patty.

11:19.445 --> 11:21.214
Girl,
our Judys are here.

11:21.214 --> 11:24.751
After all of these
goops and loops, honey,

11:24.751 --> 11:28.821
it's just really nice to have
those that you love around.

11:28.821 --> 11:32.492
And I would really love
to win with my boo-boo.

11:32.492 --> 11:34.928
Oh, my God, it's been so long.

11:34.928 --> 11:37.163
Welcome to my world.

11:37.163 --> 11:41.534
Tim and I met 25 years ago,
I guess it is now.

11:41.534 --> 11:42.869
How you doing, though?

11:42.869 --> 11:44.704
I'm good.
How are you?

11:44.704 --> 11:46.005
-Whew.
-How has this been?

11:46.005 --> 11:48.074
A rollercoaster, bitch.

11:48.074 --> 11:50.410
We have a bond
that's like unbreakable.

11:50.410 --> 11:52.412
He's my best man for my wedding.

11:52.412 --> 11:55.381
I sure hope they've reinforced
that stage with lug nuts.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.216
[both laugh]

11:57.216 --> 11:59.052
[Latrice] It feels so good

11:59.052 --> 12:02.589
to have a little piece of home
in the workroom.

12:02.589 --> 12:05.058
Wait. But did
you miss the action?

12:05.058 --> 12:06.492
I really did.

12:06.492 --> 12:08.061
Girl, I see you every day.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.462
I like literally
have just been

12:09.462 --> 12:10.930
like sitting at home
doing nothing.

12:10.930 --> 12:12.398
-Lies.
-No, seriously.

12:12.398 --> 12:13.766
You're full of shit.

12:13.766 --> 12:16.369
I've watched everything
I can possibly watch on Netflix.

12:16.369 --> 12:17.904
I fucking love Patty.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.105
Patty's not just one
of my best friends,

12:19.105 --> 12:20.506
he's also my assistant.

12:20.506 --> 12:23.676
Patty knows some secrets,
but we don't tell nobody, okay?

12:23.676 --> 12:25.511
So, boo, so take her and her.

12:25.511 --> 12:26.913
Let me get the other ones.

12:26.913 --> 12:29.148
This makeover challenge
is scary.

12:29.148 --> 12:31.851
I'll be lying if I told you
that I was excited,

12:31.851 --> 12:34.654
that I knew I was going to turn
the party, 'cause I don't.

12:34.654 --> 12:35.722
The fact of the matter is

12:35.722 --> 12:38.191
this challenge
sent me home last time.

12:38.191 --> 12:42.495
Last season, girl, you know,
this was my downfall.

12:42.495 --> 12:43.496
[Michelle] There is no
family resemblance,

12:43.496 --> 12:45.965
apart from a pair of glasses.

12:45.965 --> 12:48.568
So if I don't do well,
it's your fault.

12:48.568 --> 12:50.336
[laughs]

12:50.336 --> 12:51.504
Girl.

12:51.504 --> 12:54.674
Me and Patty are just
so vastly different.

12:54.674 --> 12:56.175
I'm 5-11, she's 5-4.

12:56.175 --> 12:58.144
I'm black as hell,
she white as hell.

12:58.144 --> 13:00.780
There is nothing
that Patty and I have

13:00.780 --> 13:01.881
that resembles each other.

13:01.881 --> 13:04.217
We both might be gay.
That's about it.

13:04.217 --> 13:05.852
[Patty] I'm like nervous,
though.

13:05.852 --> 13:08.121
-I can't fuck this up.
-[laughs]

13:08.121 --> 13:09.489
-Do you know what I mean?
-I know.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.962
Look, this is where we stop and
do a little

13:15.962 --> 13:17.163
sway, sway, sway.

13:18.898 --> 13:20.333
Oh, she's heavy.

13:20.333 --> 13:24.504
Today's maxi challenge
is to make over our Best Judy.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.506
My best friend.

13:26.506 --> 13:28.241
-Hi. Hi.
-This is my brother.

13:28.241 --> 13:29.942
-Danny.
-Danny.

13:29.942 --> 13:31.544
[Monét] It's just nice to have
somebody else in the workroom

13:31.544 --> 13:33.780
to talk to
besides these ugly bitches.

13:33.780 --> 13:37.050
Love, all in the room.

13:37.050 --> 13:38.751
But, bitch, don't forget.

13:38.751 --> 13:40.653
Somebody is getting chopped.

13:42.188 --> 13:44.657
Oh, this is going to be
gorgeous on you.

13:44.657 --> 13:47.560
Oh, wow.
I feel like a woman already.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.729
[laughs]
You look like a woman.

13:49.729 --> 13:51.631
You look..
gay Jesus.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.266
[laughs]

13:53.266 --> 13:55.334
Wow.

13:55.334 --> 13:56.836
Oh, look at this.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.838
[Manila] Michael has been
my biggest supporter

13:58.838 --> 14:00.506
since I met him.

14:00.506 --> 14:03.676
He has just always come through
and surprised me

14:03.676 --> 14:06.245
and just brought
this happiness to my life.

14:06.245 --> 14:08.414
So him being here
is so special to me.

14:08.414 --> 14:10.083
I could just hug you all day.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.250
Okay, but no, no, no.

14:11.250 --> 14:12.685
We're here to strategize
and make this a win.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.554
-Let's go.
-Okay.

14:14.554 --> 14:16.622
Walk there and walk back.

14:16.622 --> 14:19.058
Girl, I cannot...

14:19.058 --> 14:21.294
[laughs]

14:21.294 --> 14:24.297
Category is praying mantis.

14:24.297 --> 14:25.998
[Naomi]
This challenge scares me,

14:25.998 --> 14:27.967
not necessarily
because I'm scared

14:27.967 --> 14:30.403
I can't make Ricardo
look amazing.

14:30.403 --> 14:31.671
Hips forward.

14:31.671 --> 14:33.539
But because I've never been
in the top two,

14:33.539 --> 14:35.708
and last week
I was in the bottom two.

14:35.708 --> 14:39.912
I have to do well this challenge
or my ass is going home.

14:39.912 --> 14:41.714
Like plain and simple.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.251
[imitating Cary Grant]
Judy, Judy, Judy.

14:45.251 --> 14:46.619
-Hey.
-Hey, Ru.

14:46.619 --> 14:48.221
♪ Hi, Ru ♪

14:48.221 --> 14:49.522
Hi, Monique Heart.

14:49.522 --> 14:51.190
Danny, is that your real nose?

14:51.190 --> 14:52.358
-It is.
-It's gorgeous.

14:52.358 --> 14:53.426
Thank you.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.461
You both have beautiful noses.

14:55.461 --> 14:57.196
Is that the secret
to a friendship like yours?

14:57.196 --> 14:59.298
I think so.
Cheekbones and noses.

14:59.298 --> 15:01.434
-Literally.
-[laughs]

15:01.434 --> 15:02.835
Now, Monique,
you've known Danny for a while,

15:02.835 --> 15:07.206
and now you are known worldwide
as Monique Heart.

15:07.206 --> 15:09.876
How has that changed
your relationship?

15:09.876 --> 15:12.678
I see him a lot less,
but Danny has been my friend

15:12.678 --> 15:16.115
that when I am stressed
or going through it,

15:16.115 --> 15:20.052
I can see him from across
the room and I'm like, I'm okay.

15:20.052 --> 15:22.555
My elimination
I did not process well,

15:22.555 --> 15:25.458
and he was there
to be like...

15:26.926 --> 15:28.361
Danny is my best friend

15:28.361 --> 15:30.797
that I can just let my hair down
and be a hot mess,

15:30.797 --> 15:32.932
and know that it's a safe space,
and I'm not judged,

15:32.932 --> 15:34.333
and I love him.

15:34.333 --> 15:36.068
I'm gonna get real
with this one for a minute.

15:36.068 --> 15:40.606
You know, we have a tendency
to judge people on this program.

15:40.606 --> 15:41.741
I know that.

15:41.741 --> 15:43.209
She's standing up there
on the stage,

15:43.209 --> 15:45.311
and when it comes to her time
to be judged, she's like this.

15:45.311 --> 15:47.613
She's like, motherfucker,
you better--

15:47.613 --> 15:48.748
what you got to say?

15:51.584 --> 15:53.653
How do you interpret that?

15:53.653 --> 15:55.087
It's her obviously
covering something up

15:55.087 --> 15:57.757
and just like kind of masking
her true feelings at that point.

15:57.757 --> 16:01.027
You are putting a judgment
on your vulnerability.

16:01.027 --> 16:03.896
And so when
you take away that judgment,

16:03.896 --> 16:06.199
then you can just let it be.

16:06.199 --> 16:09.735
Judy is an important person
in gay history,

16:09.735 --> 16:13.606
because she embodies both
strength and vulnerability.

16:13.606 --> 16:15.875
That's why we talk about
this bitch today.

16:15.875 --> 16:17.043
Yep.

16:17.043 --> 16:19.111
-Do you love drag?
-I do love drag.

16:19.111 --> 16:21.314
-Why?
-For me, it's a safe place

16:21.314 --> 16:26.352
where Kevin gets to be loved
and appreciated for who he is.

16:26.352 --> 16:27.954
It's a beautiful thing,

16:27.954 --> 16:30.156
and we get to share that
with the world

16:30.156 --> 16:32.758
and show other kids,
other Kevins out there,

16:32.758 --> 16:34.060
other Dannys out there,

16:34.060 --> 16:37.897
how to create a place
where fantasy comes to life.

16:37.897 --> 16:43.569
I've been longing to have
a tender moment with Ru,

16:43.569 --> 16:47.240
and I get to have that with Ru
and my Judy, my best friend,

16:47.240 --> 16:50.409
and that is so amazing.

16:50.409 --> 16:52.478
Judy, Judy, Judy. Yes.

16:52.478 --> 16:53.479
-Amen.
-All right.

16:53.479 --> 16:55.915
I'll see y'all
in a minute.

16:55.915 --> 16:58.050
-Trinity and Leo.
-Yes.

16:58.050 --> 17:01.921
Now, is it kind of weird
putting your lover into drag?

17:01.921 --> 17:03.389
Um, it does feel weird,

17:03.389 --> 17:06.926
because I don't see him
like that.

17:06.926 --> 17:10.563
And I've never thought
I would date a drag queen.

17:10.563 --> 17:11.831
-Uh-huh.
-Honey.

17:11.831 --> 17:13.065
There's a first time
for everything.

17:13.065 --> 17:15.535
-Yeah.
-I don't know what to expect.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.136
I've never seen him in drag.

17:17.136 --> 17:18.537
He's a handsome boy,

17:18.537 --> 17:20.539
but I don't know if he's
gonna be a pretty girl.

17:20.539 --> 17:23.976
And what if he's prettier
than me?

17:23.976 --> 17:26.779
The biggest question
that comes to mind

17:26.779 --> 17:29.582
is if you're gonna be
part of the Tuck Dynasty,

17:29.582 --> 17:32.551
how are you going to tuck
all of that?

17:32.551 --> 17:35.254
Oh, you got
the spray adhesive there.

17:35.254 --> 17:37.490
[laughs]

17:37.490 --> 17:39.892
What you need?

17:39.892 --> 17:41.527
[RuPaul] Leo, are you
afraid of that?

17:41.527 --> 17:43.095
[Leo] I think that's okay.

17:43.095 --> 17:44.897
He's witch queen realness
right now,

17:44.897 --> 17:47.266
but we're gonna try to get him
a little finesse.

17:47.266 --> 17:49.335
Uh-huh.
Trust me, there is a sissy

17:49.335 --> 17:51.804
who lives in every man
who walks this earth.

17:51.804 --> 17:52.838
Yeah.

17:52.838 --> 17:54.340
Bring that sissy forth.

17:54.340 --> 17:55.808
We got to find
the twinkletoes.

17:55.808 --> 17:58.177
Yes. All right,
I'll see y'all in a minute.

17:58.177 --> 17:59.345
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

17:59.345 --> 18:01.013
Hi, Monét, hi, Patty.

18:01.013 --> 18:02.248
-Hi.
-Hi, Ru.

18:02.248 --> 18:03.582
What's Patty short for,
Patrick?

18:03.582 --> 18:04.584
Yes.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.519
Top of the morning to ya,
Patrick.

18:06.519 --> 18:08.721
-[laughs]
[RuPaul] How'd y'all meet again?

18:08.721 --> 18:10.156
Bob the Drag Queen
introduced us.

18:10.156 --> 18:14.260
And when you launched my star
for "Drag Race,"

18:14.260 --> 18:15.628
Patty has been traveling with me

18:15.628 --> 18:16.996
around the world
and around the country.

18:16.996 --> 18:18.297
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

18:18.297 --> 18:19.932
So this is a makeover
challenge, bitch, you know.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.500
-Ru.
-Oh, girl.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.469
You know, it was
a makeover challenge

18:23.469 --> 18:25.738
that sent your black ass
home last time.

18:25.738 --> 18:27.273
PTSD, girl.

18:27.273 --> 18:28.774
What are you gonna do

18:28.774 --> 18:30.743
to make sure
that you are not holding

18:30.743 --> 18:34.513
that Tweeterhead maquette
at the end of this challenge?

18:34.513 --> 18:37.083
I really want to make sure
that we look like family

18:37.083 --> 18:38.250
and like sell that fantasy

18:38.250 --> 18:40.987
that we were birthed
from the same vagina.

18:40.987 --> 18:43.255
We are getting a razor and
we are shaving them brows off.

18:43.255 --> 18:44.323
You're gonna shave
the brows off?

18:44.323 --> 18:45.758
-Absolutely.
-You know, I came in

18:45.758 --> 18:47.360
like really willing
to do whatever--

18:47.360 --> 18:49.628
We are dedicated
to the cause, Ru.

18:49.628 --> 18:51.063
-Because you shave yours off.
-I sure do.

18:51.063 --> 18:52.999
Yeah, shave that shit off.
It grows back.

18:52.999 --> 18:54.734
I'm gonna be single
a little bit longer.

18:54.734 --> 18:57.136
[all laugh]
[RuPaul] Right.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.437
All right, well, listen,

18:58.437 --> 18:59.872
I can't wait
to see y'all out there.

18:59.872 --> 19:01.340
-Thank you, Ru.
-Do it for Judy.

19:01.340 --> 19:02.408
-Amen.
-All right.

19:02.408 --> 19:03.709
-See you later.
-Thank you, Ru.

19:05.644 --> 19:07.346
[laughter]
[RuPaul] Hi, Michael.

19:07.346 --> 19:08.748
-Hi. Hi, Ru.
-Hi, Manila.

19:08.748 --> 19:10.116
-Hi, RuPaul.
-The happy couple.

19:10.116 --> 19:12.118
-You're married.
-Yes, we are.

19:12.118 --> 19:15.488
Now, how weird is it gonna be
to see your husband in drag?

19:15.488 --> 19:17.056
It's gonna be interesting.

19:17.056 --> 19:19.825
He hasn't really expressed
any interest in doing drag.

19:19.825 --> 19:22.261
So, padding, hips,
the whole thing.

19:22.261 --> 19:23.429
You're going to do it all.

19:23.429 --> 19:24.730
We're going to do all of it.

19:24.730 --> 19:26.632
He's going to be
in so much pain

19:26.632 --> 19:28.334
that after we're done here,

19:28.334 --> 19:30.102
he will never
be able to complain

19:30.102 --> 19:31.937
-about me being bitchy in drag.
-Uh-huh.

19:31.937 --> 19:33.372
[laughs]

19:33.372 --> 19:36.208
Now, Michael has
a very demure disposition.

19:36.208 --> 19:38.844
Yes, but that's because
I haven't put him in drag yet.

19:38.844 --> 19:40.179
[RuPaul] That's right.

19:40.179 --> 19:41.714
You've got to be prepared
for that, Michael,

19:41.714 --> 19:43.249
because you never know
what's going to emerge.

19:43.249 --> 19:45.418
And it's like I'm going
to get a whole new husband.

19:45.418 --> 19:46.485
-I love that.
-Or wife.

19:46.485 --> 19:47.820
Or rival.

19:47.820 --> 19:50.289
-Oh.
-Girl.

19:50.289 --> 19:52.158
This is going to be
a lot of fun.

19:52.158 --> 19:53.959
-Thanks for the opportunity.
-Thank you.

19:53.959 --> 19:55.694
And thanks
for bringing my husband.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.563
Now come back
when you're pregnant.

19:57.563 --> 19:58.764
-Okay.
-[both laugh]

19:58.764 --> 20:00.466
-Should we get pregnant?
-Let's go.

20:00.466 --> 20:03.436
[both laugh]

20:03.436 --> 20:04.870
-Hi, Naomi.
-Hello, Ru.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.572
Ru, this is Ricardo.
Ricardo, Ru.

20:06.572 --> 20:08.707
Yes, yes, yes.
Now, have you done drag?

20:08.707 --> 20:11.610
I haven't done drag
in the full gear, so I feel--

20:11.610 --> 20:12.611
I've seen photos of attempts.

20:12.611 --> 20:14.180
Like Halloween stuff?

20:14.180 --> 20:17.016
-Like CVS stuff.
-Oh, my God.

20:17.016 --> 20:18.350
Yes, a light
liquid foundation.

20:18.350 --> 20:19.485
-Exactly. Right.
-Yes.

20:19.485 --> 20:20.953
What drag are you planning?

20:20.953 --> 20:24.423
We could go to go really safe
and be flouncy and fashiony,

20:24.423 --> 20:26.759
but I kind of want to shock
and like do like--

20:26.759 --> 20:27.760
I want there to be concept.

20:27.760 --> 20:28.861
I don't want to just be like

20:28.861 --> 20:30.329
two pretty people
walking down the runway.

20:30.329 --> 20:32.565
Yeah.
Are your hands shaking?

20:32.565 --> 20:34.667
I'm always shaking.
[laughs]

20:34.667 --> 20:36.035
Why? What is that?

20:36.035 --> 20:37.369
I'm just nervous.

20:37.369 --> 20:40.072
Okay, just go deep
for a minute.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.807
What are you afraid
might happen?

20:41.807 --> 20:44.009
It's really about me
saying the wrong thing

20:44.009 --> 20:45.444
-or looking like a fool.
-Okay.

20:45.444 --> 20:46.946
In front of someone
I look up to so much.

20:46.946 --> 20:49.381
Okay, yeah, okay.
This is the key to this.

20:49.381 --> 20:52.384
-Please, say the wrong thing.
-Mm-hmm.

20:52.384 --> 20:54.587
And please
act like a fool.

20:56.021 --> 20:57.156
This entire competition,

20:57.156 --> 21:00.059
I have been playing it
very safe.

21:00.059 --> 21:02.862
But this is the time
to step outside the box

21:02.862 --> 21:03.996
and make Ru proud.

21:03.996 --> 21:05.531
Now, put this bitch
up into drag.

21:05.531 --> 21:07.099
You better make some coin.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.467
All right,
I'll see you guys later.

21:08.467 --> 21:10.069
-Okay, Thank you, Ru.
-Thank you so much.

21:10.069 --> 21:11.637
Hey, Latrice.

21:11.637 --> 21:13.239
-Hi, Tim.
-Hi.

21:13.239 --> 21:14.740
Now, Tim, have you
done drag before?

21:14.740 --> 21:17.710
In '94, I got a wild hair

21:17.710 --> 21:19.879
and said, "Latrice,
I wanna do drag."

21:19.879 --> 21:23.082
And I told everybody my name's
gonna be Alexis Knight.

21:23.082 --> 21:24.783
Alexis Knight.
With a K.

21:24.783 --> 21:27.086
So I get all done up,
prettied up,

21:27.086 --> 21:29.655
I open the door, all my friends
are in the living room.

21:29.655 --> 21:31.557
I'm like
introducing Alexis Knight.

21:31.557 --> 21:35.127
And this one yells, "Good night,
Alexis, good night."

21:35.127 --> 21:36.796
[all laugh]

21:36.796 --> 21:38.130
Oh, no.

21:38.130 --> 21:41.033
So 24 years later,
here's your shot.

21:41.033 --> 21:42.668
She's coming back.

21:42.668 --> 21:44.236
The Knight is upon us.

21:44.236 --> 21:46.038
-[laughs]
-Yes.

21:46.038 --> 21:48.107
Tell me about
your relationship.

21:48.107 --> 21:50.843
We have been through
some times together.

21:50.843 --> 21:52.178
[Tim] There's those people
in your life

21:52.178 --> 21:55.648
that you just call
and go, "I need you now."

21:55.648 --> 21:57.917
And it doesn't matter
when or what time,

21:57.917 --> 21:59.618
they come to your house,

21:59.618 --> 22:01.587
and they leave you
when you're better.

22:01.587 --> 22:03.556
It just goes without saying.

22:03.556 --> 22:04.823
Yeah.

22:04.823 --> 22:08.661
You were there for her
when she was incarcerated.

22:08.661 --> 22:09.662
Yes.

22:09.662 --> 22:13.065
I had a drug charge,

22:13.065 --> 22:15.701
violated the terms
of my probation,

22:15.701 --> 22:17.169
and the judge gave me 18 months.

22:17.169 --> 22:20.706
The storage unit
that all of his stuff was in

22:20.706 --> 22:22.641
was auctioned off
without any of us knowing,

22:22.641 --> 22:24.610
so the last weekend
of furloughs,

22:24.610 --> 22:27.146
I literally went out
and got a bunch of fabric,

22:27.146 --> 22:29.014
and I said, "Today, we workin'."

22:29.014 --> 22:32.251
And we just cut out outfits
and sat there and sewed all day.

22:32.251 --> 22:34.286
And when he left,
he had six outfits

22:34.286 --> 22:38.557
so that he could get out
and start working right away.

22:38.557 --> 22:44.096
I can't ever repay him
for helping me get my life back.

22:44.096 --> 22:47.032
You know,
that just touches my heart,

22:47.032 --> 22:49.201
because I've had similar
situations in my life

22:49.201 --> 22:50.736
when I was down and out.

22:50.736 --> 22:53.105
And my friends, just like
Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz

22:53.105 --> 22:54.273
in the poppy fields,

22:54.273 --> 22:57.876
when she just decided
to lay down for a while,

22:57.876 --> 23:01.480
who called me up and said,
"You get your ass up.

23:01.480 --> 23:04.850
I'm here to remind you
who you are."

23:04.850 --> 23:06.418
And you need those friends.

23:06.418 --> 23:07.519
And that's why it's
so important

23:07.519 --> 23:09.121
that you're here
for this Judy challenge,

23:09.121 --> 23:11.824
because the Best Judys
we collect

23:11.824 --> 23:14.193
in this lifetime
that we have,

23:14.193 --> 23:16.929
that we need at those times
when we don't have anybody else.

23:16.929 --> 23:19.431
They're so special.

23:19.431 --> 23:21.333
I'm so happy that you are here.

23:21.333 --> 23:23.502
You lifted her up
when she needed you.

23:23.502 --> 23:27.406
Now she's gonna lift you up
so that Miss Alexis Knight

23:27.406 --> 23:31.176
can live
in the broad daylight, honey.

23:31.176 --> 23:32.544
[laughs] Yes!

23:32.544 --> 23:33.712
-Gonna let you have it.
-Hold me back, honey.

23:33.712 --> 23:35.180
All right,
see you in a minute.

23:35.180 --> 23:37.149
All right.

23:39.752 --> 23:42.121
[Latrice] I love you so much.

23:46.158 --> 23:48.494
The Judys from New York City.

23:48.494 --> 23:50.629
-♪ She's a super queen ♪
-Oh, reveal.

23:50.629 --> 23:52.932
[Manila] It's elimination day,

23:52.932 --> 23:55.567
and we have to put
our Best Judys in full drag,

23:55.567 --> 23:57.236
do a Judy Garland
tribute number,

23:57.236 --> 24:01.507
and then walk down the stage
with a family resemblance.

24:01.507 --> 24:03.008
It's going to be
a long day, kids.

24:03.008 --> 24:04.977
-Everything happens today.
-Happens today.

24:04.977 --> 24:08.380
The challenge, the runway.
How stressful is that?

24:08.380 --> 24:10.416
Like, exhausting.

24:10.416 --> 24:13.018
And then it gets
emotionally draining, too,

24:13.018 --> 24:14.286
-because somebody's going home.
-So it's like a rollercoaster.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.688
Yeah.
It's a rollercoaster.

24:15.688 --> 24:18.357
You got all this high going on
and adrenaline pumping,

24:18.357 --> 24:20.592
and then it's like
♪ dun-dun-dun ♪

24:20.592 --> 24:21.894
There's not many of us left.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.562
Bitches are gonna do
what they wanna do.

24:23.562 --> 24:25.130
Scrap, scrap, scrap, scrap.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.432
And I feel like

24:26.432 --> 24:29.001
if I'm in the bottom at
this point in the competition,

24:29.001 --> 24:30.736
they might feel like
I've had too many chances

24:30.736 --> 24:32.237
and send me home.

24:32.237 --> 24:34.540
So I'm trying to be on top.

24:34.540 --> 24:36.108
Always, from here out.

24:36.108 --> 24:38.010

24:47.086 --> 24:48.020
Are you really gonna
like shave them off?

24:48.020 --> 24:49.154
Yeah.

24:49.154 --> 24:51.590
Do y'all remember Powder,
the movie,

24:51.590 --> 24:53.525
and the little white boy
with no--

24:53.525 --> 24:55.227

24:57.429 --> 24:58.564
I'm just saying.

24:58.564 --> 25:00.466
Can't we get rid
of my moustache first?

25:00.466 --> 25:02.534
All right, here we go.
Turn this way, please.

25:02.534 --> 25:04.002
-If you cut me, bitch--
-I'm not gonna cut you.

25:04.002 --> 25:05.137
-I swear to God--
-I'm not gonna cut you.

25:05.137 --> 25:07.439
-I swear to God.
-I promise I won't.

25:07.439 --> 25:09.875
Oh, my God.

25:09.875 --> 25:12.478
I'm so gagged.
You look so cute.

25:12.478 --> 25:14.246
[Patty] I'm gonna look
like an alien.

25:14.246 --> 25:15.581
[Monét] Yes, very Neanderthal.

25:15.581 --> 25:17.416
[laughs]

25:17.416 --> 25:19.418
We're not shaving
your brows off.

25:19.418 --> 25:21.353
Goodbye.

25:21.353 --> 25:23.255
[Naomi] Beards are masks.

25:23.255 --> 25:27.326
Men hide behind beards
like women hide behind makeup.

25:27.326 --> 25:29.194
And once we shave that off,

25:29.194 --> 25:32.297
who the hell knows
who's underneath there?

25:32.297 --> 25:35.701
I have always hated
Patty's moustache,

25:35.701 --> 25:38.237
so it is a pleasure
to whack it off.

25:38.237 --> 25:40.572
You look like seven years old.

25:40.572 --> 25:42.441
[laughs]

25:42.441 --> 25:45.144
Oh, no facial hair.

25:45.144 --> 25:46.445
I'm sad a little bit.

25:46.445 --> 25:48.113
-That's still kind of--
-No, I'm going to go--

25:48.113 --> 25:49.148
Shave-shave.

25:49.148 --> 25:50.282
Is that
the family resemblance?

25:50.282 --> 25:51.283
Aah!

25:51.283 --> 25:53.619
My Judy is a manly man,

25:53.619 --> 25:56.088
and that's great, because
we need those in the world.

25:56.088 --> 25:59.058
But, baby, not so much...
[laughs]

25:59.058 --> 26:02.327
here in this competition
right now.

26:03.896 --> 26:06.732
Did you ever imagine
when we first started dating

26:06.732 --> 26:09.635
that you would be
on RuPaul's Drag Race?

26:09.635 --> 26:11.703
-Are you crying?
-Yes.

26:11.703 --> 26:13.005
[laughs]

26:13.005 --> 26:14.373
I'm doing Latrice.

26:14.373 --> 26:16.475
[all laugh]

26:16.475 --> 26:18.577
What about you, Naomi?

26:18.577 --> 26:19.978
My look tonight?

26:19.978 --> 26:21.513
Yeah, girl.
Whatcha doing?

26:21.513 --> 26:23.182
I'm actually going to do
a little bit of boy drag.

26:23.182 --> 26:24.917
-What?
-Yeah.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.819
Because
I've been playing it safe

26:26.819 --> 26:30.522
this entire competition,
and I'm gonna take a risk.

26:30.522 --> 26:31.924
Come on, boy drag?

26:31.924 --> 26:33.525
I can't wait to see you, bitch.

26:33.525 --> 26:35.327
Are you painting
the Holy Ghost over here, bitch?

26:35.327 --> 26:37.830
Can you go back over there
with your little man?

26:37.830 --> 26:39.131
[Trinity] I know she pale.

26:39.131 --> 26:40.499
She probably
ain't never seen the sun.

26:40.499 --> 26:42.401
But, bitch, give her
some cheeks.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.103
[gasps]

26:45.103 --> 26:46.805
Oh, my God.

26:46.805 --> 26:48.006
I love it.

26:48.006 --> 26:51.343
Ahh. Oh, my God.
[laughs]

26:51.343 --> 26:52.945
I think I might
have created a monster.

26:52.945 --> 26:55.414
I might have to put a lock
on my drag room.

26:55.414 --> 26:57.282
Um, you're so beautiful,

26:57.282 --> 26:59.551
I might need to have a private
moment with my new wife.

26:59.551 --> 27:02.721
We'll be back, darling.

27:03.856 --> 27:06.592
Oh. Okay.

27:06.592 --> 27:09.428
That looks good.

27:09.428 --> 27:12.564
In the words
of Alyssa Edwards, beast!

27:14.600 --> 27:17.102
The outfits
that I'm putting us in

27:17.102 --> 27:19.805
probably don't need to tuck,
but I don't care.

27:19.805 --> 27:23.208
I want my husband
to have the full experience.

27:23.208 --> 27:25.210
And I still want to touch
my husband's dick.

27:25.210 --> 27:26.311
Whoa.
[rip]

27:26.311 --> 27:28.413
Aah!

27:28.413 --> 27:29.681
Aah!

27:29.681 --> 27:30.782
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.

27:30.782 --> 27:32.484
[rip]

27:32.484 --> 27:33.886
Maybe I should have told him

27:33.886 --> 27:35.053
that he should trim
down there a little bit.

27:35.053 --> 27:37.055
Uhh!

27:37.055 --> 27:38.657
-You ready?
[Leo] Yes.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.259
You sure?

27:40.259 --> 27:42.928
Size doesn't necessarily matter
with tucking.

27:42.928 --> 27:45.998
Like, you can have a big thing
and tuck just fine.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.099
[rip]

27:47.099 --> 27:50.035
And Leo is just gifted

Feel tight there?

28:01.947 --> 28:03.615
-Yes.
-Feel secure?

31:36.128 --> 31:38.630
Blondes have more...hair.

31:38.630 --> 31:40.198
[all laugh]

31:40.198 --> 31:42.000
[Latrice] We are strutting
down this runway

31:42.000 --> 31:46.204
like two big ol' bitches
that are large and in charge.

31:46.204 --> 31:48.006
Big hair, big jewels,

31:48.006 --> 31:51.209
just full-on
Latrice Royale fantasy.

31:51.209 --> 31:53.879
[Michelle] The best little
whorehouse in Sylmar.

31:53.879 --> 31:56.348

31:56.348 --> 31:59.718
[RuPaul] Monique Heart
& Shanida Heart.

31:59.718 --> 32:00.819
[Carson] Well, you know,
they always say

32:00.819 --> 32:02.854
the eyes are the window
to the spleen.

32:02.854 --> 32:04.089
[all laugh]

32:04.089 --> 32:05.590
[Michelle]
Their jokes are cornea.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.659
Oh.

32:07.659 --> 32:10.195
[Monique] Me and my good Judy,
Miss Shanida Heart

32:10.195 --> 32:13.832
have our lovely avant garde
optical illusion costumes on.

32:13.832 --> 32:15.801
[Carson] Oh, my God,
they just crossed their eyes.

32:15.801 --> 32:17.202
[all laugh]

32:17.202 --> 32:18.637
[Monique] Looking gorgeous,

32:18.637 --> 32:21.206
goop for the gods,
winking at the judges.

32:21.206 --> 32:22.808
[Carson] Blink twice
if your feet hurt.

32:22.808 --> 32:25.544
[all laugh]

32:25.544 --> 32:29.681
[RuPaul] Manila Luzon
& Iyowife Luzon.

32:29.681 --> 32:31.116
[Michelle]
Aren't they well suited?

32:31.116 --> 32:32.284
[all laugh]

32:32.284 --> 32:33.618
[Frances] I see a queen.

32:33.618 --> 32:34.619
[RuPaul] Well,
I hear they're not

32:34.619 --> 32:35.787
playing with a full deck.

32:35.787 --> 32:38.190
[all laugh]

32:38.190 --> 32:41.226
[Manila] Iyowife and I
are queens from the deck.

32:41.226 --> 32:42.561
She is the queen of diamonds

32:42.561 --> 32:44.729
because, hello,
she's a married lady.

32:44.729 --> 32:47.732
And I'm the queen of clubs,
because I love to go clubbing.

32:47.732 --> 32:50.202
We are serving
poke-her realness.

32:50.202 --> 32:52.537
We are royalty, darling.

32:52.537 --> 32:53.872
[Carson] Now is that
a pair of queens?

32:53.872 --> 32:55.674
I know it's definitely
not a straight.

32:55.674 --> 32:57.142

Naomi Smalls & Extra Smalls.

Ooh.

33:01.613 --> 33:04.983
[Frances] Gypsies, tramps,
and thieves.

33:04.983 --> 33:09.688
[Naomi] My runway look
is full-on Cher fantasy.

33:09.688 --> 33:12.357
[Michelle] Ooh.
[all laugh]

33:12.357 --> 33:14.926
Just got a lot Sonny-er.

33:14.926 --> 33:18.096
She's giving me a Bono.
[all laugh]

33:18.096 --> 33:19.998
[Naomi] My Sonny look
is kind of feminine

33:19.998 --> 33:22.200
because he was kind of
feminine,

33:22.200 --> 33:25.070
and the Seventies were
a great time for androgyny.

33:25.070 --> 33:28.206
I could just show off
my wife Cher,

33:28.206 --> 33:30.575
and what's a better way
to honor than through love?

33:30.575 --> 33:33.044
Stupid.

33:33.044 --> 33:36.281
[RuPaul] Trinity The Tuck
& Indigo The Tuck.

33:36.281 --> 33:38.817
You know, the McGuire sisters
haven't been the same

33:38.817 --> 33:41.019
since Dottie left us.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.354
[all laugh]

33:42.354 --> 33:44.356
[Trinity] This is
an expensive tuck, bitch.

33:44.356 --> 33:46.658
We look good in our Versace.

33:46.658 --> 33:48.193
We are twinning for the win.

33:48.193 --> 33:51.229
Move over, bitches, because
Indigo is coming through.

33:51.229 --> 33:52.998
[Carson] They're snatched.

33:52.998 --> 33:54.933
[Michelle] Has anybody
been able to find

33:54.933 --> 33:56.568
that Chattanooga choo-choo?

[RuPaul] Monét X Change
& Patty Cash.

34:03.408 --> 34:06.678
Monét, you look like the mother
of a Solid Gold dancer.

34:06.678 --> 34:08.346
[Frances] Stay golden,
kitty girl.

34:08.346 --> 34:10.749
[Carson] Well, I know who wears
the pants in this family.

34:10.749 --> 34:12.350

34:12.350 --> 34:14.586
[Monét] We are serving
New York City's finest.

34:14.586 --> 34:16.254
She's giving you
a little Dita Von Teese.

34:16.254 --> 34:19.291
I'm giving you a little black
chocolate Judy Garland, honey.

34:19.291 --> 34:21.393
We look good.
I feel like we look expensive.

34:21.393 --> 34:23.862
And we both have
the X Change family secret:

34:23.862 --> 34:25.196
a big ol' booty.

34:25.196 --> 34:27.565
[Carson] There's gold
in them there cheeks.

34:27.565 --> 34:29.301
[all laugh]

34:29.301 --> 34:32.404
Welcome, ladies.

34:32.404 --> 34:34.539
It's time for
the judges' critiques,

34:34.539 --> 34:38.977
starting with Monique Heart
and Shanida Heart.

34:38.977 --> 34:42.948
There's no nose contouring
needed there, is there?

34:44.950 --> 34:47.852
You make a gorgeous woman.
Oh, my God.

34:47.852 --> 34:49.321
Thank you. I know.

34:49.321 --> 34:51.056
[all laugh]

34:51.056 --> 34:52.991
Family resemblance, I mean,

34:52.991 --> 34:54.826
you obviously
both have the same eyes.

34:54.826 --> 34:56.895
Hee-hee.

34:56.895 --> 34:58.029
Thanks.
I'm here every Thursday.

34:58.029 --> 34:59.230
-Try the veal.
-[laughs]

34:59.230 --> 35:01.032
But I love
the details of this.

35:01.032 --> 35:03.668
I love the campiness
of the eyes

35:03.668 --> 35:05.704
because you both see the world
the same way.

35:05.704 --> 35:07.672
And I thought
the wittiness behind that

35:07.672 --> 35:09.107
really shows
how in sync you are.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.141
Thank you.

35:10.141 --> 35:12.410
Your performance,
it was messy.

35:12.410 --> 35:13.778
I'm not gonna lie.

35:13.778 --> 35:16.915
But I do want to compliment you

35:16.915 --> 35:19.884
on how great your makeup
has been consistently.

35:19.884 --> 35:22.587
Where you've got it,
you stay with it.

35:22.587 --> 35:24.689
The color is perfect.

35:24.689 --> 35:28.994
Up next, Monét X Change
and Patty Cash.

35:28.994 --> 35:30.095
Cha-ching.

35:30.095 --> 35:31.496
[all laugh]

35:31.496 --> 35:33.465
Monét, you've never looked
more gorgeous.

35:33.465 --> 35:37.335
I just thought this was really
a great winning/twinning look.

35:37.335 --> 35:40.472
-Thank you.
-Let's get to your performance.

35:43.608 --> 35:45.276
It was so brilliant.

35:45.276 --> 35:46.911
Oh, I was about to say,
oh, God.

35:46.911 --> 35:51.049
You had the aura,
the essence, the steps,

35:51.049 --> 35:53.251
the faces,
the little Judy-isms.

35:53.251 --> 35:55.053
They were all there,
and I had chills.

35:55.053 --> 35:56.421
I don't get chills.

35:56.421 --> 35:58.423
-Maybe it's menopause.
-Maybe.

35:58.423 --> 36:00.392
[all laugh]

36:00.392 --> 36:01.526
I really loved it.

36:01.526 --> 36:02.861
I enjoyed every moment
watching you guys.

36:02.861 --> 36:04.396
I soaked it all in.

36:04.396 --> 36:06.598
Yes! Michelle, you see.

36:06.598 --> 36:08.933
No more sponges.
Frances, don't encourage.

36:08.933 --> 36:10.068
[Frances laughs]

36:10.068 --> 36:15.607
Up next, Manila Luzon
and Iyowife Luzon.

36:15.607 --> 36:17.909
Both of you really understood

36:17.909 --> 36:20.045
the theatrical element
of what you were doing.

36:20.045 --> 36:23.848
And you looked like
you were having so much fun.

36:23.848 --> 36:25.550
However, flip side.

36:25.550 --> 36:29.521
This look on the runway
was not doing it for me.

36:29.521 --> 36:32.924
It's a little not what
I'm used to from Manila Luzon.

36:32.924 --> 36:33.992
Everything
that you've brought so far

36:33.992 --> 36:36.127
has been so elaborate
and so fun,

36:36.127 --> 36:39.230
and this is just a little
costume shop for me.

36:39.230 --> 36:41.132
Kind of looks like
maybe like a goddess costume

36:41.132 --> 36:45.103
that you threw some, like,
some card memorabilia on top of.

36:45.103 --> 36:47.172
And also,
no family resemblance.

36:47.172 --> 36:50.041
It's like distant cousins,
maybe, you know?

36:50.041 --> 36:51.409
Okay.

36:51.409 --> 36:55.213
What the judges may not know
is that y'all's married.

36:55.213 --> 36:59.117
Michael... [sighs]

36:59.117 --> 37:00.385
Michael was there for me

37:00.385 --> 37:04.556
when I was really having
a hard time after I lost Sahara.

37:04.556 --> 37:09.994
And it felt like she sent him
to come help comfort me

37:09.994 --> 37:12.597
while I was going through
all the pain.

37:12.597 --> 37:16.701
And he's been
so supportive of my career.

37:16.701 --> 37:18.937
So thank you so much
for bringing him here.

37:18.937 --> 37:21.172
This means so much
to both of us.

37:21.172 --> 37:23.141
Thank you.
That's beautiful.

37:25.577 --> 37:29.781
Up next, Latrice Royale
and Alexis Knight.

37:29.781 --> 37:31.049
Ooh, girl.

37:31.049 --> 37:33.485
You know, Latrice,
when you step out on stage,

37:33.485 --> 37:36.488
each and every time,
you fill my heart with joy.

37:36.488 --> 37:38.490
-However--
-Oh, damn.

37:38.490 --> 37:40.291
Let's talk about your dance.

37:40.291 --> 37:43.561
What I got from it
was an overwhelming sense

37:43.561 --> 37:45.797
of you wanting
to help your partner

37:45.797 --> 37:49.134
that you were forgetting
to keep yourself in the game.

37:49.134 --> 37:51.102
Your smile was on the whole
time, don't get me wrong,

37:51.102 --> 37:53.238
but I felt like
your mind was elsewhere.

37:53.238 --> 37:55.740
The performance is, you know,
a little bit awkward,

37:55.740 --> 38:01.179
but what stood out more for me
was the charisma and the love

38:01.179 --> 38:02.580
that just
comes out of your face.

38:02.580 --> 38:05.083
I mean, I don't know you,
but I would love to know you,

38:05.083 --> 38:07.318
because you seem like
a really beautiful soul.

38:07.318 --> 38:09.687
[Michelle]
Tonight on the runway,

38:09.687 --> 38:11.656
there's a disconnect
with family resemblance.

38:11.656 --> 38:14.592
I felt like the makeup's
totally different.

38:14.592 --> 38:17.162
The outfits
are totally different.

38:17.162 --> 38:19.230
The color scheme
is totally different.

38:19.230 --> 38:21.266
That is two different looks.
It really is.

38:21.266 --> 38:23.368
If you want to pitch me on it,
I'm open to--

38:23.368 --> 38:25.503
Fire and ice,
red and blue, baby.

38:25.503 --> 38:27.105
-Hot and cold.
-Fire and ice.

38:27.105 --> 38:29.374
What you're giving me.
[laughs]

38:29.374 --> 38:32.544
[laughs] Bitch, that's
what I do day in and day out.

38:32.544 --> 38:33.578
Touché.

38:33.578 --> 38:36.214
I kind of get
the family resemblance.

38:36.214 --> 38:39.017
I see, you know,
the lip color is the same,

38:39.017 --> 38:41.019
the same kind of idea
with the eye makeup,

38:41.019 --> 38:42.520
the same jewelry.

38:42.520 --> 38:45.390
You're kind of like both on the
same episode of Drag Dynasty.

38:45.390 --> 38:47.625
I get it.
I get the family thing.

38:47.625 --> 38:49.160
Now, Alexis Knight,

38:49.160 --> 38:52.764
I know that you had
a premiere many years ago,

38:52.764 --> 38:55.867
but this is sort of
a comeback for you.

38:55.867 --> 38:57.402
How does the comeback feel?

38:57.402 --> 38:59.270
Well, I thought
it went a lot better

38:59.270 --> 39:00.638
than the judges thought,
I guess.

39:00.638 --> 39:01.739
[all laugh]

39:01.739 --> 39:02.941
I have a completely
different respect

39:02.941 --> 39:05.043
for all the ladies
up here on stage.

39:05.043 --> 39:06.678
This is hard.

39:06.678 --> 39:11.916
Up next, Naomi Smalls
and Extra Smalls.

39:11.916 --> 39:14.385
It's Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour.

39:14.385 --> 39:16.821
[Ellen] I loved the performance.

39:16.821 --> 39:18.923
You're both super-graceful.

39:18.923 --> 39:20.391
You know, you took chances.

39:20.391 --> 39:22.560
You did things
that nobody else did,

39:22.560 --> 39:24.729
-and you had fun.
-Thank you so much.

39:24.729 --> 39:26.798
You came out with two Chers.
We're like, okay.

39:26.798 --> 39:29.300
That's a clever twist
on family members.

39:29.300 --> 39:32.904
And then when you did the wig
reveal and you gave us our Bono,

39:32.904 --> 39:36.374
that was really clever and fun,
and you still look chic.

39:36.374 --> 39:39.210
I am obsessed
with these looks.

39:39.210 --> 39:43.915
Like this makeup is just
like va-va-voom stunning.

39:43.915 --> 39:47.518
And this male reveal
kept it very effeminate.

39:47.518 --> 39:49.220
[Michelle] Here's the best part
of it all.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.356
You look like you're related.

39:51.356 --> 39:52.490
You did a great job with that.

39:52.490 --> 39:53.558
Thank you.

39:53.558 --> 39:54.926
Naomi, in the workroom,

39:54.926 --> 39:58.596
I challenged you to make
mistakes and to be goofy,

39:58.596 --> 40:00.398
and you did
and it paid off.

40:00.398 --> 40:01.699
So thanks for Cher-ing.

40:01.699 --> 40:02.734
[all laugh]

40:02.734 --> 40:06.137
Up next, Trinity The Tuck.

40:06.137 --> 40:08.506
Ladies and gentlemen,
for your consideration,

40:08.506 --> 40:10.608
Indigo The Tuck.

40:10.608 --> 40:13.077
We're gonna start
with your Judy number.

40:13.077 --> 40:17.282
It was very simple,
but very effective.

40:17.282 --> 40:19.684
There wasn't really
great choreography.

40:19.684 --> 40:21.119
There wasn't a lot to it.

40:21.119 --> 40:22.086
But there was
such a great connection

40:22.086 --> 40:23.187
between the two of you.

40:23.187 --> 40:25.390
[Ellen] Right now,
with this look,

40:25.390 --> 40:27.191
you're giving me
Linda Evangelista

40:27.191 --> 40:31.496
and Christy Turlington from
the Versace runway from 1987.

40:31.496 --> 40:32.997
This is family resemblance.

40:32.997 --> 40:34.165
It's not identical,

40:34.165 --> 40:36.301
you're nodding
to each other's outfits,

40:36.301 --> 40:39.337
and it's flawless tonight.

40:39.337 --> 40:41.272
-Thank you.
-You know, I've always said,

40:41.272 --> 40:43.074
drag doesn't change
who you are.

40:43.074 --> 40:45.076
It actually reveals who you are.

40:45.076 --> 40:49.047
I'm so proud of each of you
to be gracious enough

40:49.047 --> 40:51.616
to share that other side
of yourself

40:51.616 --> 40:55.453
with our family
and families around the world.

40:55.453 --> 41:00.124
Auditions for Season 12
starts tomorrow.

41:00.124 --> 41:02.460
[all laugh]

41:02.460 --> 41:05.663
Now, based on
your Best Judys performances

41:05.663 --> 41:09.967
and presentations,
I've made some decisions.

41:11.569 --> 41:14.072
Monét X Change.

41:14.072 --> 41:15.840
Naomi Smalls.

41:17.308 --> 41:18.476
Con-drag-ulations.

41:18.476 --> 41:20.645
You are the top two All Stars
of the week.

41:20.645 --> 41:23.614
[cheers]

41:23.614 --> 41:27.251
You've each won a trip for two
to Iceland.

41:27.251 --> 41:29.220
-What?
-Oh!

41:29.220 --> 41:31.923
[RuPaul]
Including first-class airfare,

41:31.923 --> 41:35.793
and a four-night stay
at Design Hotel,

41:35.793 --> 41:39.731
courtesy of Pink Iceland
and Wow Air.

41:39.731 --> 41:41.432
You go. I'll take you.

41:41.432 --> 41:44.135
And your Best Judys
have each won

41:44.135 --> 41:48.706
a $1.000 gift card
from Klein, Epstein & Parker.

41:48.706 --> 41:51.275
Guess you're gonna get a suit?

41:51.275 --> 41:54.278
Trinity The Tuck, you're safe.

41:54.278 --> 41:55.980
Thank you.

41:58.850 --> 42:01.652
Monique Heart, you're safe.

42:04.989 --> 42:08.926
That means Manila Luzon
and Latrice Royale,

42:08.926 --> 42:12.697
I'm sorry, my dears,
but you are in the bottom two.

42:12.697 --> 42:14.031
Best friends.

42:14.031 --> 42:17.301
Monét and Naomi,

42:17.301 --> 42:19.170
each of you needs to decide

42:19.170 --> 42:21.873
which of the bottom queens
you'll eliminate

42:21.873 --> 42:24.475
if you win the lip sync.

42:25.743 --> 42:29.847
So while you queens
deliberate in the workroom,

42:29.847 --> 42:32.417
the judges and I
will be creating

42:32.417 --> 42:35.253
a RuPaul's Drag Race
time capsule.

42:35.253 --> 42:37.688
[all chuckle]

42:37.688 --> 42:39.190
Ladies,
you may leave the stage.

42:41.225 --> 42:43.728
Naomi Smalls.

42:43.728 --> 42:45.730
-Finally.
-Yeah, sis.

42:45.730 --> 42:48.032
Is this what it feels like?
[all laugh]

42:48.032 --> 42:50.935
I'm finally in the top,
thank the Lord.

42:50.935 --> 42:52.603
I needed this so bad.

42:52.603 --> 42:56.207
It feels like it's been
a long time coming.

42:56.207 --> 42:59.043
But I'm living in this moment,

42:59.043 --> 43:01.145
and this feels like
where I'm supposed to be.

43:01.145 --> 43:03.548
It feels good to be home.
[laughs]

43:03.548 --> 43:04.615
Congratulations, Naomi.

43:04.615 --> 43:06.083
-Yay.
-Thank you.

43:06.083 --> 43:07.985
It's a long time coming,
bitch.

43:07.985 --> 43:10.688
It really was.
Tick tock, motherfucker.

43:10.688 --> 43:11.989
Congratulations, Monét.

43:11.989 --> 43:13.124
-Thank you.
-Yes, congratulations.

43:13.124 --> 43:14.525
Thank you, thank you, girl.

43:14.525 --> 43:16.561
This is the challenge that
sent me home last time, girl.

43:16.561 --> 43:17.995
-It feels--
-Ru-demption, huh?

43:17.995 --> 43:19.964
Girl, it feels so good
to win it,

43:19.964 --> 43:21.999
because a makeover
is fucking hard.

43:21.999 --> 43:23.134
I'm not a makeup artist.

43:23.134 --> 43:24.368
-We know.
-I know how to paint my--

43:24.368 --> 43:27.772
[all laugh]
Oh, damn.

43:27.772 --> 43:30.408
The Best Judys
find themselves in the bottom.

43:30.408 --> 43:32.376
-[laughs]
-Oh, my God.

43:32.376 --> 43:33.678
Isn't that crazy?

43:33.678 --> 43:36.047
-The meta of it all.
-Wow.

43:36.047 --> 43:38.883
But I think that
we do have obviously

43:38.883 --> 43:40.685
the decision
that has to be made.

43:40.685 --> 43:45.289
And I would love to talk
to Man-la--I was--

43:45.289 --> 43:48.493
-Latrila.
-I almost said Latrila.

43:48.493 --> 43:51.462
Latrila is up for elimination.

43:51.462 --> 43:55.633
That's the hard gaggerini
of the whole situation,

43:55.633 --> 43:57.902
because
I don't want her to go,

43:57.902 --> 44:00.538
and I know
she don't want me to go.

44:00.538 --> 44:02.707
But this is the way
the cookie crumbles.

44:02.707 --> 44:04.041
-Can I talk to you--
-Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah.

44:04.041 --> 44:05.810
-Do want me to take the couch?
-Of course.

44:05.810 --> 44:08.012
I love Manila,
don't get me wrong.

44:08.012 --> 44:11.616
But if it comes down to I'm
not about to sacrifice myself

44:11.616 --> 44:13.951
and say, oh, let me go home,
you stay.

44:13.951 --> 44:15.219
Girl, please.

44:15.219 --> 44:16.854
Girl, I'll see you
on the other side.

44:16.854 --> 44:19.123
[laughs] What?

44:19.123 --> 44:22.293
You know without me
having to say it

44:22.293 --> 44:24.629
how much being here means to me.

44:24.629 --> 44:26.197
-Yeah.
-It's no secret that,

44:26.197 --> 44:29.033
bitch, I'm on a mission
and want to be here.

44:29.033 --> 44:31.269
And I can say this.

44:31.269 --> 44:32.904
Manila has done an exceptional
job in this competition.

44:32.904 --> 44:34.739
-She really has.
-Yeah.

44:34.739 --> 44:37.608
She is now in the bottom.
Today's that day.

44:37.608 --> 44:39.010
We have separate stories.

44:39.010 --> 44:42.079
I have come from a situation
where I have been eliminated

44:42.079 --> 44:43.781
and fought my way back in here

44:43.781 --> 44:45.750
to show people
that I really mean business.

44:45.750 --> 44:47.485
You understand
what I'm saying?

44:47.485 --> 44:50.588
Girl, let me
tell you this, okay?

44:50.588 --> 44:52.857
There is no T
and no shade,

44:52.857 --> 44:55.192
but Latrice has not been doing
as well as the rest of us.

44:55.192 --> 44:56.894
Latrice is a legendary queen.

44:56.894 --> 44:57.929
Latrice is fierce.

44:57.929 --> 44:59.664
Everybody loves Latrice Royale.

44:59.664 --> 45:02.633
But if you are judging
a cooking competition,

45:02.633 --> 45:04.569
I'm judging you on
this flat-ass souffle

45:04.569 --> 45:07.638
you made today,
not the beautiful confection

45:07.638 --> 45:09.273
you made last month.
That doesn't matter.

45:09.273 --> 45:11.642
It's we are here and now,
and this is the moment.

45:11.642 --> 45:12.777
Live in this moment.

45:12.777 --> 45:15.146
I am filtering through
my feelings, you know.

45:15.146 --> 45:16.314
[Latrice] Yeah,
filter through them,

45:16.314 --> 45:17.315
and make it based off

45:17.315 --> 45:18.683
of who you want
to see be here.

45:18.683 --> 45:21.018
Like, that's just what
it boils down to at this point.

45:21.018 --> 45:23.254
'Cause there's six of us,
and it's like,

45:23.254 --> 45:25.122
well, who do I want to be
in the top with?

45:25.122 --> 45:26.524
Yeah.

45:26.524 --> 45:28.159
Girl.

45:28.159 --> 45:29.193
First of all,
congratulations on your win.

45:29.193 --> 45:30.194
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

45:30.194 --> 45:31.162
I'm really proud of you.

45:31.162 --> 45:32.330
Thank you so much.

45:32.330 --> 45:34.031
And thank you so much
for the damn moustache.

45:34.031 --> 45:35.800
[both laugh]
Legit.

45:35.800 --> 45:36.934
Thank you for making--

45:36.934 --> 45:39.704
I'm so happy
that I was able to use it.

45:39.704 --> 45:41.539
Well, I wasn't expecting
to be here today,

45:41.539 --> 45:44.241
so I'm a little gagged.

45:44.241 --> 45:46.477
But with so few girls,

45:46.477 --> 45:49.113
just any little thing
can land you in the bottom.

45:49.113 --> 45:51.882
I mean, it was bound to happen
after a certain point.

45:51.882 --> 45:53.551
You've been slaying
the competition, though.

45:53.551 --> 45:55.319
With the--thank you.

45:55.319 --> 45:57.388
[Naomi] I grew up
watching Manila Luzon.

45:57.388 --> 45:59.156
Like, I first started watching
RuPaul's Drag Race

45:59.156 --> 46:00.424
when I was in junior high,

46:00.424 --> 46:03.761
and that's when Manila
was on her first season.

46:03.761 --> 46:07.665
So it's fucking wild
to be in this position.

46:07.665 --> 46:09.667
What's it feel like being
in the bottom with Latrice?

46:09.667 --> 46:11.168
It's painful,

46:11.168 --> 46:16.340
because I don't want Latrice
to go home, obviously.

46:16.340 --> 46:18.676
But now it's come to like, okay,

46:18.676 --> 46:23.180
well, if I'm going to pick
between my friend and myself,

46:23.180 --> 46:25.116
I have to fight for myself.

46:25.116 --> 46:28.653
So I would love
to still be here.

46:28.653 --> 46:30.187
This is my first time
here in the bottom.

46:30.187 --> 46:32.523
I've been slaying
the competition.

46:32.523 --> 46:34.225
I know I'm big competition.

46:34.225 --> 46:35.359
Right.

46:35.359 --> 46:38.396
Naomi and Monét
have a choice right now.

46:38.396 --> 46:41.565
They can get rid
of their biggest competition

46:41.565 --> 46:44.035
or they can keep me in the game

46:44.035 --> 46:47.271
and fight with the biggest,
the baddest, and the best.

46:47.271 --> 46:48.606
So it's going to be up to them

46:48.606 --> 46:50.975
to decide how they want
to play this game.

46:50.975 --> 46:56.981
If this is my last day here
in Drag Race ever,

46:56.981 --> 47:01.319
I know that I still have my life
that goes on, you know.

47:01.319 --> 47:04.488
And I have a great life
and I'm blessed, you know.

47:04.488 --> 47:06.590
And...

47:06.590 --> 47:07.925
Manila, I seriously
love you so much,

47:07.925 --> 47:09.493
and I look up to you so much.

47:09.493 --> 47:11.962
It's crazy that we're even
in this fucking predicament.

47:11.962 --> 47:13.564
Your work just speaks for you,

47:13.564 --> 47:15.566
and your track record
speaks for you.

47:15.566 --> 47:16.901
Honestly, you're a legend.

47:16.901 --> 47:18.135
Thank you.

47:18.135 --> 47:22.039
Who do you think Naomi
is going to pick?

47:22.039 --> 47:24.709
I don't know.

47:24.709 --> 47:26.077
It's Manila's first time
in the bottom two.

47:26.077 --> 47:29.313
[Monique] Very first time.

47:29.313 --> 47:32.616
However, Latrice
saved her last week.

47:32.616 --> 47:36.020
[gasps] That's right.

47:36.020 --> 47:37.855
What do you think
Monét's going to do?

47:37.855 --> 47:40.891
I...I...

47:40.891 --> 47:42.359
She's your friend.

47:42.359 --> 47:43.894
But I don't know.

47:43.894 --> 47:47.231
Remember when Monét
was in the bottom,

47:47.231 --> 47:48.999
Manila was going
to send Monét home.

47:52.169 --> 47:55.239
I just can't deny
what's in my heart.

47:55.239 --> 47:57.208
You know how loyal
I am to my friends.

47:57.208 --> 47:58.943
So I'm so sorry.

48:00.277 --> 48:01.545
The goopery.

48:01.545 --> 48:02.646
Girl.

48:03.781 --> 48:07.852
I don't agree
with my position here today.

48:07.852 --> 48:09.253
I feel like Valentina
when I say that.

48:09.253 --> 48:10.454
[laughs]

48:10.454 --> 48:12.456
I don't identify
with me being the bottom,

48:12.456 --> 48:14.759
um, but here I am.

48:14.759 --> 48:16.961
And like, look,

48:16.961 --> 48:19.196
I know I've been doing amazing
in this competition.

48:19.196 --> 48:23.033
And, you know, this week
was very distracting

48:23.033 --> 48:26.070
with our besties
and our loved ones coming back,

48:26.070 --> 48:29.640
and so maybe I fucked up
a little bit.

48:29.640 --> 48:32.343
You guys already listed me
as, you know,

48:32.343 --> 48:33.878
the biggest competition
with Trinity here.

48:33.878 --> 48:36.847
-Girl, yeah.
-So, like, no hard feelings

48:36.847 --> 48:38.916
if you just want
to like send me packing.

48:38.916 --> 48:40.117
-[laughs]
-So you have--

48:40.117 --> 48:42.686
So I can make it easy
for the rest of y'all.

48:42.686 --> 48:43.721
I don't think that Manila

48:43.721 --> 48:45.556
feels the need
to plead her case.

48:45.556 --> 48:48.058
She wants to let her ranking
in the competition

48:48.058 --> 48:49.426
do all the talking.

48:49.426 --> 48:52.296
And I think that it's
a bold move for a bitch to do.

48:52.296 --> 48:54.899
Maybe she should
have started with

48:54.899 --> 48:56.600
I'm so sorry
for what I did last time

48:56.600 --> 48:58.402
when you were in the bottom.

48:58.402 --> 48:59.670
Like she should
have went that away,

48:59.670 --> 49:02.173
'cause if that was the case,
I'd be like, ooh.

49:02.173 --> 49:03.340
Keep.

49:03.340 --> 49:04.809
-I love you, bitch.
-Thanks.

49:04.809 --> 49:07.578
Well, well, well.

49:07.578 --> 49:10.214
Have the tides turned.

49:10.214 --> 49:12.116
I don't know what the hell
Naomi's going to do.

49:12.116 --> 49:14.819
But last week, I saved her.

49:14.819 --> 49:17.221
So let's not forget that.

49:17.221 --> 49:19.190
You really had my back
last week.

49:19.190 --> 49:22.226
I really appreciate that
you saw something in me that--

49:22.226 --> 49:24.428
Oh, baby, it wasn't your time.

49:24.428 --> 49:25.429
You understand what I'm saying?

49:25.429 --> 49:27.064
And look what happened.

49:27.064 --> 49:28.966
It was so fucking, the payoff.

49:28.966 --> 49:30.734
I was so grateful,

49:30.734 --> 49:32.937
and I respect you so much,
'cause you--

49:32.937 --> 49:34.738
You needed your--
you needed your time, Naomi.

49:34.738 --> 49:36.240
Thank you.

49:36.240 --> 49:38.008
This is a peculiar situation.

49:38.008 --> 49:40.177
Manila and I
are both in the bottom.

49:40.177 --> 49:41.779
How fucked up,
you know what I mean?

49:41.779 --> 49:42.780
Right.

49:42.780 --> 49:44.615
But it's no secret, bitch,

49:44.615 --> 49:48.786
that this ho wants,
deserve to be here.

49:48.786 --> 49:50.588
We want to play
a fair game here,

49:50.588 --> 49:54.792
and based on her track record,
Manila deserves to be saved.

49:54.792 --> 49:57.628
But Latrice saved my ass
last week.

49:57.628 --> 49:58.896
It's wild.

49:58.896 --> 50:01.832
I don't necessarily
want to feel these feelings.

50:01.832 --> 50:03.434
This is what we came for,
baby.

50:03.434 --> 50:06.303
[Naomi] I want to do
the right thing, but...

50:06.303 --> 50:07.304
[sighs]

50:07.304 --> 50:10.841
[cheers and applause]

50:10.841 --> 50:12.843
It's really great
to have our Judys here

50:12.843 --> 50:16.347
and to have another person
experience the stress

50:16.347 --> 50:19.817
and the craziness
that is RuPaul's Drag Race,

50:19.817 --> 50:21.986
because you can
describe it to people,

50:21.986 --> 50:24.421
but until you live
this life, girl,

50:24.421 --> 50:26.090
you will never
understand it.

50:26.090 --> 50:27.958
How you doing, baby?

50:27.958 --> 50:29.526
Mm, no.

50:29.526 --> 50:30.895
No? No good for Loki?

50:30.895 --> 50:34.598
It hurts me so much to see
both of you in the bottom

50:34.598 --> 50:36.934
when you both worked so hard.

50:36.934 --> 50:38.602
And you look so fabulous.

50:38.602 --> 50:41.505
And I look up to you so much.

50:41.505 --> 50:43.240
Oh, Michael.

50:43.240 --> 50:46.777
I'm really hurt because
Michael has to experience this,

50:46.777 --> 50:49.780
and I just don't want him
to blame himself.

50:49.780 --> 50:51.682
I want him to know
that I failed us,

50:51.682 --> 50:54.184
not him failing me.

50:54.184 --> 50:58.289
The love that
is radiating out of your bodies

50:58.289 --> 51:00.958
is so inspiring.

51:00.958 --> 51:04.862
So like the fact that this
didn't work out for us,

51:04.862 --> 51:07.598
I'm--baby, I am so proud.

51:07.598 --> 51:10.100
I'm so happy--oh.

51:10.100 --> 51:12.202
No more tears.

51:12.202 --> 51:15.039
I'm the one that's trying
to hold everybody together.

51:15.039 --> 51:16.240
I've done this a lot.

51:16.240 --> 51:17.608
She's usually the one
crying her eyes out.

51:17.608 --> 51:18.943
Oh, my God.

51:18.943 --> 51:23.414
But it's like I'm so proud
just to have you here.

51:23.414 --> 51:26.617
Regardless, win, lose,
or draw, fuck that.

51:26.617 --> 51:29.987
This is what this is about.

51:29.987 --> 51:33.390
And I have my best friend
in the whole wide world here.

51:33.390 --> 51:36.060
He's up in drag looking like
a truck driver cross-dresser.

51:36.060 --> 51:37.995
[laughs]

51:37.995 --> 51:41.198
All other shit aside,
like, the competition,

51:41.198 --> 51:44.468
the risk of being eliminated,
all that, fuck all that.

51:44.468 --> 51:45.703
The only thing
I'm concerned about

51:45.703 --> 51:49.273
is that Tim is having
an enjoyable experience.

51:49.273 --> 51:51.041
I love you so much.

51:51.041 --> 51:54.411
-We have now a great memory.
-[sobs]

51:54.411 --> 51:56.313
[Latrice] All the things
we've been through,

51:56.313 --> 51:59.149
this is one for the books.

51:59.149 --> 52:02.186
Now the items
in this here time capsule

52:02.186 --> 52:04.655
need to tell people
in 100 years

52:04.655 --> 52:07.191
what Drag Race was all about.

52:07.191 --> 52:08.492
Ellen?

52:08.492 --> 52:11.428
I'm including the infamous

52:11.428 --> 52:14.898
Season 1
filter A Navajo blanket.

52:14.898 --> 52:18.168
Oh, my God,
I miss that blanket.

52:18.168 --> 52:19.370
[laughs]

52:19.370 --> 52:22.573
I am including this photo
of us from 1993.

52:22.573 --> 52:23.774
It's the day I told you

52:23.774 --> 52:26.010
to do a show called
RuPaul's Drag Race.

52:26.010 --> 52:27.011
[laughs] Oh.

52:27.011 --> 52:29.113
I remember it well.

52:29.113 --> 52:30.881
Michelle?

52:30.881 --> 52:33.317
To honor
all of our shameless plugs,

52:33.317 --> 52:36.186
I'm including
a fabulous collection

52:36.186 --> 52:38.989
of these Sunday Riley
beauty products,

52:38.989 --> 52:45.129
including their incredible
Good Genes All-In-One treatment.

52:45.129 --> 52:47.398
Delicious.

52:47.398 --> 52:48.832
Ooh, that's some good stuff.

52:48.832 --> 52:50.367
And Carson.

52:50.367 --> 52:53.237
In honor of the pit crew,
who love their snacks,

52:53.237 --> 52:55.572
I'm including this bag of nuts.

52:55.572 --> 52:59.209
Ooh, child, get them nuts
away from my face.

52:59.209 --> 53:01.245
[all laugh]

53:01.245 --> 53:03.614
Silence.

53:03.614 --> 53:06.116
Bring back my All Stars.

53:11.221 --> 53:12.356
[Monét] This decision
is definitely harder

53:12.356 --> 53:13.524
than I thought it would be.

53:13.524 --> 53:15.459
If you'd asked me
a few weeks ago,

53:15.459 --> 53:16.727
bitch, if Manila
even breathed wrong,

53:16.727 --> 53:18.629
I'm like home. Bye.

53:18.629 --> 53:21.865
But now that
she's up against someone

53:21.865 --> 53:24.468
who is not doing a good job
in the competition,

53:24.468 --> 53:27.404
it makes it a little harder
to make a choice

53:27.404 --> 53:28.472
and pull a lipstick.

53:28.472 --> 53:32.342
It is a lot to think about.

53:32.342 --> 53:34.211
But I know that
I need to make a decision

53:34.211 --> 53:36.046
that I feel good about,

53:36.046 --> 53:38.615
and one
that is going to leave me

53:38.615 --> 53:42.219
feeling like I made
the right decision for me.

53:42.219 --> 53:46.890
These two queens
walked in together handcuffed,

53:46.890 --> 53:51.829
and now they're in
the bottom two on death row.

53:51.829 --> 53:54.098
[gasps] The irony of it all.

53:54.098 --> 53:58.736
I just know that my heart
is telling me

53:58.736 --> 54:01.171
to go with my gut,

54:01.171 --> 54:04.575
and my gut is telling me
to go with my brain.

54:06.376 --> 54:10.080
My brain is telling me
to go with... [gasps]

54:12.783 --> 54:14.485
[RuPaul] Welcome back, ladies.

54:14.485 --> 54:18.622
Two top All Stars
stand before me.

54:18.622 --> 54:24.294
Ladies, this is your chance
to impress me, win $10.000,

54:24.294 --> 54:26.096
and earn the power

54:26.096 --> 54:30.100
to give one of the bottom queens
the chop.

54:32.069 --> 54:34.238
The time has come...
[thunder]

54:34.238 --> 54:36.140
for you to lip sync...

54:36.140 --> 54:39.776
[echoing] for your legacy!

54:41.612 --> 54:43.547

57:18.368 --> 57:19.569
Con-drag-ulations.

57:19.569 --> 57:23.807
You've earned a cash tip
of $10.000.

57:23.807 --> 57:25.609
Cha-ching, cha-ching.

57:25.609 --> 57:26.810
[applause]

57:26.810 --> 57:28.612
Monét X Change, you are safe.

57:28.612 --> 57:29.880
You may join the other girls.

57:31.581 --> 57:35.385
Now, will the bottom two queens
please step forward.

57:42.859 --> 57:47.597
Naomi Smalls, with great power
comes great responsibility.

57:48.832 --> 57:52.869
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

57:52.869 --> 57:55.939
The queen I've chosen
to get the chop tonight...

57:55.939 --> 57:59.009
in this competition, you
taught me to believe in myself

57:59.009 --> 58:01.545
when I didn't even actually
believe in myself.

58:01.545 --> 58:04.247
And I really, really greatly
appreciate you for that.

58:04.247 --> 58:08.385
And I'm so sorry that
I have to send home...

58:10.687 --> 58:12.356
Manila.

58:14.424 --> 58:17.227
Oh!

58:26.236 --> 58:28.271
[RuPaul] Manila Luzon,

58:28.271 --> 58:32.509
as it is written,
so it shall be done.

58:32.509 --> 58:37.981
You are and will always be
an All Star.

58:37.981 --> 58:41.184
Now sashay away.

58:54.364 --> 58:55.832
[Monét] I love you, bitch.

58:57.401 --> 58:59.836
Oh, um, correction, Ru.

58:59.836 --> 59:03.073
That's "always will be
a double All Star."

59:03.073 --> 59:04.808
[all laugh]

59:04.808 --> 59:06.476
Okay.

59:08.779 --> 59:10.614
See you guys later.

59:10.614 --> 59:11.648
Love you!

59:16.053 --> 59:17.621
I don't know what I think

59:17.621 --> 59:20.924
about me being eliminated
tonight.

59:20.924 --> 59:22.192
It's a lot to process,

59:22.192 --> 59:24.060
especially
this late in the game

59:24.060 --> 59:25.862
after I've been doing so well.

59:25.862 --> 59:29.566
But these queens have to do
what's best for their game

59:29.566 --> 59:32.202
just the same way that I was
doing the best for my game.

59:32.202 --> 59:34.070
It was a great--

59:34.070 --> 59:37.374
Oh, hey, baby.

59:37.374 --> 59:38.909
You're my winner.

59:38.909 --> 59:42.179
And I have chicken dinner
waiting for us at home.

59:42.179 --> 59:44.948
[Manila] I have
so many other blessings,

59:44.948 --> 59:46.817
but this still
definitely sucks,

59:46.817 --> 59:49.786
because this has been a dream
of mine for a really long time.

59:49.786 --> 59:52.956
My husband, my wife,
my partner in life

59:52.956 --> 59:55.025
has always been a winner.

1:00:01.298 --> 1:00:03.967
Con-drag-ulations, All Stars.

1:00:03.967 --> 1:00:06.436
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1:00:06.436 --> 1:00:08.238
how in the hell you gonna love
somebody else?

1:00:08.238 --> 1:00:10.874
Can I get an amen up in here?

1:00:10.874 --> 1:00:12.242
-Amen.
-All right.

1:00:12.242 --> 1:00:13.310

1:00:32.329 --> 1:00:35.098
You are a fucking shady bitch
for doing that.

1:00:35.098 --> 1:00:36.766
Life's not fair.

1:00:36.766 --> 1:00:38.502
[laughs]

1:00:38.502 --> 1:00:40.337
For this week's
maxi challenge,

1:00:40.337 --> 1:00:43.907
you'll be overacting
in a mockumentary,

1:00:43.907 --> 1:00:45.809
Sex and the Kitty, Girl.

1:00:45.809 --> 1:00:48.411

Oh, yes.

1:00:48.411 --> 1:00:51.615
You look like
you just seen a ghost.

1:00:51.615 --> 1:00:54.317
Yeah, do that, please.

1:00:54.317 --> 1:00:55.685
Do that.

1:00:55.685 --> 1:00:58.421
-Cowabunga!
-Oh!

1:00:58.421 --> 1:01:00.457
I woke up about an hour ago.

1:01:00.457 --> 1:01:02.425
Okay.

1:01:02.425 --> 1:01:04.094
[laughs]

1:01:04.094 --> 1:01:06.429
[Latrice] Today's elimination is
the last one before the finale.

1:01:06.429 --> 1:01:08.865
And that's a lot of pressure.

1:01:08.865 --> 1:01:10.834
[Naomi] Maybe I think like
our past scorecards

1:01:10.834 --> 1:01:12.903
might have to start
coming into play.

1:01:12.903 --> 1:01:15.972
-That's bullshit.
-I don't trust anybody now.

1:01:15.972 --> 1:01:17.541
I know it would make
great television
