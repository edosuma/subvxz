12:42.218 --> 12:45.449
No, l think that's against regulations.

12:56.898 --> 12:58.934
GRECO: You probably got doubts
about me, Slivowicz?

12:59.098 --> 13:00.736
SlPOWlCZ:
Hey, it's Sipowicz.

13:00.938 --> 13:03.372
Well, anyway, l'm trying
to do the right thing here.

13:03.538 --> 13:05.529
-l'm not doing this for the money.
-Really.

13:12.538 --> 13:16.053
Hey, Tommy, Alex.

13:17.378 --> 13:18.697
What is this?

13:18.858 --> 13:20.894
This is who will get
what you're looking for.

13:21.058 --> 13:23.049
-So you bring him here?
-This isn't right.

13:23.218 --> 13:27.734
l'm here because you won't
front money, and l don't go on credit.

13:27.938 --> 13:30.247
You want me to leave?

13:30.418 --> 13:32.613
We just weren't expecting this.

13:32.778 --> 13:35.531
SlPOWlCZ:
We all get set in our ways.

13:36.418 --> 13:37.897
Now. . .

13:38.738 --> 13:41.411
. . .l have access to military hardware.

13:41.578 --> 13:43.933
Did l tell you or did l tell you?

13:45.538 --> 13:47.176
Here's what we need:

13:47.338 --> 13:50.535
An AT-4 Viper
or an MK-1 9 grenade launcher.

13:50.738 --> 13:54.208
-What are you looking to take out?
TOMMY: Can you get it or not?

13:55.458 --> 13:56.891
The MK, no problem.

13:57.098 --> 13:58.895
How much?

13:59.058 --> 14:02.289
lt comes off the armory at night.
lt's back the next night.

14:02.458 --> 14:05.336
The rent's 4500.
Half of that's in the front.

14:05.538 --> 14:09.451
lt's 300 for a round. Any damage
to our weapon is a separate discussion.

14:09.618 --> 14:11.256
When do you need it?

14:11.858 --> 14:14.372
-We'll give you notice.
-At least 24 hours.

14:14.538 --> 14:17.769
TOMMY: We'll let you know through
Vinnie. We'll give you 1 500 now. . .

14:17.978 --> 14:19.570
. . .and the rest on delivery.

14:19.858 --> 14:22.008
Don't dick around
and embarrass yourself.

14:22.778 --> 14:25.815
Thanks. Your friends are very nice.

14:26.018 --> 14:28.054
TOMMY:
Wait, wait.

14:28.898 --> 14:31.207
We'll do business. Sit down.

14:35.138 --> 14:36.366
OFFlCER 1 : Hey, sarge.
SERGEANT: Hey.

14:36.578 --> 14:37.772
OFFlCER 2:
Sarge.

14:37.938 --> 14:40.771
-Another citizen exercising her freedoms.
-Yeah, here you are.

14:40.938 --> 14:43.452
l'm hearing rumors this could be
the Dictionary Killer.

14:43.618 --> 14:45.051
-You hear that?
BENlTA: lf l printed. . .

14:45.258 --> 14:48.216
. . .the department's looking into
a connection with Webster. . .

14:48.378 --> 14:50.528
. . .would l be wrong?

14:50.698 --> 14:54.054
Let's say you wouldn't wind up
in trouble. l don't have further comment.

14:54.218 --> 14:56.334
-Excuse me.
-Bobby. . .

14:56.498 --> 14:58.409
. . .l wanna buy you dinner.

14:59.618 --> 15:01.927
Do you do that sort of thing yet?

15:02.098 --> 15:04.771
-Yeah, l do that sort of thing.
-Good.

15:05.658 --> 15:07.535
-Tonight?
-No, it can't be tonight.

15:08.338 --> 15:10.056
Hi. Bobby?

15:10.218 --> 15:12.129
-Long time, huh?
-How's it going?

15:12.338 --> 15:13.657
SOLOMON:
How you doing, Benita?

15:13.818 --> 15:16.252
-Okay, detective. How are you?
-Okay.

15:16.458 --> 15:17.777
What would you be doing here?

15:17.978 --> 15:20.890
-You gotta excuse me.
SlMONE: We're up here.

15:23.058 --> 15:24.252
SOLOMON: You caught
this double homicide?

15:24.418 --> 15:25.407
SlMONE:
Yeah.

15:25.578 --> 15:27.091
Good, l'm glad you're on it.

15:27.258 --> 15:30.375
l don't think we got Webster here,
but it's an interesting case.

15:30.538 --> 15:32.529
SlMONE:
Yeah, we'll see.

15:33.618 --> 15:36.416
You'll explain to your client
how an appearance ticket works?

15:36.578 --> 15:37.852
Yes, l will. Detective. . .

15:38.138 --> 15:39.969
-. . .thanks for your understanding.
-Mm-hm.

15:40.138 --> 15:42.447
GUMBLE:
l hope you realize this wasn't personal.

15:42.618 --> 15:45.576
You mean, am l worried l might've
done something to set you off?

15:45.738 --> 15:50.016
No, just that l want you to understand
it wasn't directed at you specifically.

15:50.178 --> 15:53.090
Yeah? Well, it was directed at me,
Mr. Gumble. . .

15:53.258 --> 15:55.294
. . .and l suggest you keep it
in your pants.

15:56.338 --> 15:57.532
-Sarge?
SERGEANT: Yeah?

15:57.738 --> 16:00.206
-This guy is getting a DAT.
SERGEANT: Right.

16:00.418 --> 16:02.932
All right, let's start
with the obvious differences.

16:03.098 --> 16:08.218
Every Webster homicide is Fort Tryon
Park or Riverdale. These are downtown.

16:08.418 --> 16:11.137
These are stabbing-strangulations.
Webster's are shootings.

16:11.298 --> 16:13.334
lt's hard to make this
the Dictionary Killer.

16:13.498 --> 16:16.376
Only real similarity is words cut
from Webster's 3rd Edition.

16:16.538 --> 16:20.247
-Which is the guy's signature.
-So if a copycat uses it. . .

16:20.458 --> 16:21.418
. . .he's got an instant resume. He buys
into six murders going back five years.

16:21.418 --> 16:24.251
. . .he's got an instant resume. He buys
into six murders going back five years.

16:24.418 --> 16:28.127
A copycat would try to keep patterns as
close as he could to the original crimes.

16:28.298 --> 16:30.573
Yeah, well, this is different, all right.

16:30.778 --> 16:34.566
August 1 7, DOA,
there wasn't even a male victim.

16:34.778 --> 16:38.612
Every Webster homicide
involved couples.

16:38.778 --> 16:41.372
How do you wanna divide the work?

16:41.538 --> 16:43.688
All right, your people
focus on today's DOAs.

16:43.858 --> 16:46.133
Task force will work comparisons
among the murders.

16:46.298 --> 16:50.007
Obviously, it's all gonna be cooperating
with each other, sharing information.

16:51.378 --> 16:54.211
We made a section in Anti-crime
available for task force use.

16:54.378 --> 16:56.175
SOLOMON:
Appreciate it.

16:57.498 --> 16:58.931
You got plans for lunch?

16:59.098 --> 17:01.407
We can grab a sandwich,
go over what l got.

17:01.578 --> 17:04.376
Yeah. Hey, Bobby.

17:04.578 --> 17:06.329
Hold on a second, would you?

17:06.498 --> 17:08.647
Listen. . .

17:08.818 --> 17:11.890
. . .you been on this case, what,
27 minutes?

17:12.058 --> 17:15.767
My suggestion, raise your possibilities
through me.

17:15.938 --> 17:19.453
-Filter through me.
-All right.

17:19.617 --> 17:22.928
l was going through the 61 s from
last August 1 7. There was this guy--

17:23.098 --> 17:27.489
Wait, wait, wait, hold on a second.
You're on today's DOAs.

17:27.657 --> 17:31.731
August 1 7 is not an aspect
of the case you're on.

17:31.898 --> 17:35.447
Right. So you want what l got
on today's DOAs?

17:35.658 --> 17:38.047
Yeah. Let me get set up,
and l'll get back with you.

17:38.218 --> 17:40.015
SlMONE:
All right.

17:40.178 --> 17:43.966
-Bobby, good to have you on the team.
-Thanks, inspector.

17:44.178 --> 17:46.248
You said you had something else
to talk about?

17:46.418 --> 17:48.978
An old stool of mine
named Vinnie Greco.

17:49.138 --> 17:51.698
-He helped get me into the bureau.
HAVERlLL: What about him?

17:51.858 --> 17:54.053
He's back in town.
He was in Witness Protection.

17:54.258 --> 17:56.533
-They dump him out of it?
-He says he dropped out.

17:56.738 --> 18:00.367
He's peddling information about
two guys planning an armored-car heist.

18:00.578 --> 18:03.376
lt could be a shakedown by a scumbag,
figures you owe him.

18:03.538 --> 18:05.574
Well, l sent Sipowicz with Greco
to a meet.

18:05.778 --> 18:07.689
Sipowicz thinks the heist
is probably real.

18:07.858 --> 18:11.328
He's at lD section now, trying to put
names on the guys Vinnie introduced.

18:11.498 --> 18:15.013
-lf it's a scam, they could be in on it.
-lf it's a heist and we didn't move. . .

18:15.178 --> 18:19.296
. . .and someone gets killed, l'd hate
to be the one making explanations.

18:20.498 --> 18:22.773
l okay no money without
talking to Vinnie.

18:22.938 --> 18:24.257
You wanna do that now?

18:24.458 --> 18:27.530
You want me to do it
after we get egg on our faces?

18:27.738 --> 18:29.854
How do l reach the guy?

18:46.058 --> 18:47.889
HAVERlLL: Excuse me.
COSTAS: Yeah.

18:48.058 --> 18:51.448
-Sylvia.
-Hi, how was Dan's service?

18:51.618 --> 18:54.576
lt makes you think about things.

18:55.778 --> 18:59.896
l talked to Andy Jr. before, about
maybe having dinner tomorrow night.

19:00.098 --> 19:02.293
You wanna have him over?

19:03.018 --> 19:04.770
Well, l kind of thought. . .

19:04.938 --> 19:09.011
. . .l'd kind of gradually let him know
about our situation, but. . . .

19:09.738 --> 19:13.936
Well, maybe it's a good idea
he gets the whole picture.

19:14.178 --> 19:16.248
Yeah.

19:17.338 --> 19:20.011
l do a great leg of lamb.

19:22.858 --> 19:25.213
COSTAS: See you, Donna.
DONNA: Bye, Sylvia.

19:25.418 --> 19:28.091
So how did that meet go
with Fancy's old stool?

19:28.298 --> 19:33.656
The guy's 80 percent crap,
but l think his information's alive.

19:33.858 --> 19:35.689
So you gonna be working on that?

19:37.738 --> 19:40.969
Yeah. Second body turned up, huh?

19:41.178 --> 19:43.248
Yeah.

19:43.698 --> 19:46.053
Andy, l'd like to get
your help on this, man.

19:46.898 --> 19:49.731
l don't know when this other thing will
move. Whatever l can do.

19:49.938 --> 19:53.453
-This task force is a freeze-out, man.
-Yeah, you surprised on that?

19:53.938 --> 19:55.769
Check my thinking on something.

19:55.938 --> 19:58.498
The perp leaves notes
on both bodies today, right?

19:58.658 --> 20:01.047
The second note he cops to a murder
on August 1 7. . .

20:01.218 --> 20:04.733
-. . .in Battery Park, a female strangled.
-Dictionary homicides are shootings.

20:04.938 --> 20:08.692
l know, l know, but l'm going through
all these 61 s here from August 1 7. . .

20:08.858 --> 20:11.975
. . .and here's a guy who was shot
in the ass five blocks away.

20:12.138 --> 20:14.208
Claims it was an unsuccessful mugging.

20:14.378 --> 20:16.608
-You give this to the task force?
-Yeah, l tried.

20:16.818 --> 20:19.969
Told me to mind my own business.
Am l right contacting this guy?

20:20.178 --> 20:21.247
Absolutely.

20:21.418 --> 20:25.969
lf the guy that was shot in his ass and
the August 1 7 female were involved. . .

20:26.178 --> 20:27.770
. . .we're closer to Webster's pattern.

20:28.458 --> 20:31.973
You gave Solomon his whack.
Give this ass guy a call.

20:32.178 --> 20:33.770
That's what l say.

20:34.658 --> 20:36.853
DONNA:
Detective?

20:38.058 --> 20:39.935
Victim's father.

20:41.698 --> 20:45.054
Mr. Rudman, l'm really sorry
for your loss, sir.

20:45.218 --> 20:48.176
l now understand that this
might be a serial killer.

20:48.378 --> 20:51.529
There's a possibility. We're just
shaking things out right now.

20:51.738 --> 20:55.014
My daughter is dead. l have a right
to know what you're working on.

20:55.178 --> 21:00.093
Yes, you do, but we don't wanna give
you any partial or misleading information.

21:06.218 --> 21:07.970
Whoever it is. . .

21:08.138 --> 21:10.413
. . .l'll give you a million dollars
to kill him.

21:10.578 --> 21:14.048
Mr. Rudman, l know you're in grief
over your daughter.

21:14.218 --> 21:17.847
RUDMAN: My grief is my own business.
l know how the system works.

21:18.058 --> 21:21.494
l can feed a million dollars
into an account anywhere in the world.

21:21.698 --> 21:24.053
Sir, this kind of talk
does no one any good.

21:24.258 --> 21:27.250
This man strangled my child!

21:30.578 --> 21:33.297
lf he's arrested and brought to trial. . .

21:33.698 --> 21:39.375
. . .the next three years will bring him
exactly what his warped mind desires.

21:39.578 --> 21:42.729
He'll be paraded in front of
news cameras every day.

21:43.058 --> 21:47.290
There will be books, movies.

21:48.458 --> 21:50.494
l don't deserve that.

21:50.658 --> 21:51.886
My child doesn't.

21:52.098 --> 21:54.214
No, you don't.

21:54.378 --> 21:57.051
Now, Mr. Rudman,
l want you to go home.

21:57.218 --> 21:59.857
You have a wife, am l right?

22:00.018 --> 22:02.578
-My wife is still alive.
-You should go be with her. . .

22:02.738 --> 22:05.935
. . .and l'll contact you if there are
any developments, all right?

22:09.818 --> 22:13.731
My offer stands. A million dollars.

22:13.898 --> 22:15.536
l want the man dead.

22:20.338 --> 22:23.330
Would that be in unmarked bills?

22:37.098 --> 22:38.087
OFFlCER 1 : Hey.
-Hey.

22:38.258 --> 22:40.453
OFFlCER 2: Detective.
-Hi.

22:40.658 --> 22:41.738
What'd he do?

22:42.058 --> 22:44.856
Exposed himself on 1 1 th Street.
We had three different calls.

22:45.018 --> 22:47.009
l don't know what comes over me.

22:47.178 --> 22:49.692
No DAT for this guy.
He was a collar yesterday.

22:49.858 --> 22:51.974
l want him upstairs.
l'm gonna bring a DA in.

22:52.178 --> 22:54.851
This thing has a mind of its own.

22:58.578 --> 23:00.455
-Mr. Marks?
-Yes. Bob, please.

23:00.618 --> 23:01.687
-Detective Simone.
-Hi.

23:01.858 --> 23:03.371
This is Detective Sipowicz.

23:03.578 --> 23:04.852
MARKS: Hi.
-Appreciate you coming.

23:05.058 --> 23:07.014
Hey, l'm a pro-police guy.

23:07.218 --> 23:09.413
But if this is about
the shooting last summer. . .

23:09.578 --> 23:11.489
. . .there's nothing more
l can tell you.

23:11.658 --> 23:13.967
We just wanna go over
a couple of things.

23:14.658 --> 23:18.094
''August 1 7,
approximately 1 0:45 p.m. . .

23:18.258 --> 23:21.056
. . .perpetrator attempted to grab
victim's wallet.

23:21.218 --> 23:24.528
Victim resisted. ln the ensuing struggle,
perpetrator fired one shot. . .

23:24.738 --> 23:26.729
. . .into victim's buttocks before running. ''

23:26.938 --> 23:28.576
Yeah, bullet's still in there.

23:28.738 --> 23:31.696
l just thank God for a
well-padded tokus.

23:33.338 --> 23:35.772
Are you aware there was a homicide
that same night. . .

23:35.938 --> 23:37.815
. . .a half a mile away in Battery Park?

23:38.018 --> 23:39.698
-A woman was strangled.
-Yeah, l learned about that subsequently.

23:39.698 --> 23:41.051
-A woman was strangled.
-Yeah, l learned about that subsequently.

23:41.258 --> 23:43.010
The victim's name was Stacy Siegal.

23:44.218 --> 23:45.970
Did you know her at all?

23:46.138 --> 23:49.528
By coincidence, yeah,
l had a casual acquaintance with her.

23:49.698 --> 23:52.974
SlMONE: Bob, you work at the
Gibson & Smith ad agency.

23:53.178 --> 23:55.738
One of your accounts
is Moonglow shampoo.

23:55.898 --> 23:59.857
Stacy worked for Alive Products Beauty
Aids Division, marketing associate. . .

24:00.018 --> 24:01.371
. . .Moonglow shampoo.

24:01.538 --> 24:03.654
What, are you investigating me?

24:03.858 --> 24:07.248
We're looking into your relationship
with that girl, yeah.

24:08.298 --> 24:10.573
My God, you don't think
l killed her, do you?

24:10.738 --> 24:13.855
No, we don't, but we think you were
with her when she was attacked.

24:14.538 --> 24:16.415
And we think the guy who did it is back.

24:17.058 --> 24:20.095
Listen, l've given every piece
of information. . .

24:20.258 --> 24:22.613
. . .concerning that attack on me
that l recall.

24:22.818 --> 24:26.208
l described the perpetrator
as exactly as l could.

24:26.418 --> 24:28.409
He was tall. He was wearing
a red ski mask.

24:28.578 --> 24:31.695
Yeah, you just fibbed a little
about being by yourself. . .

24:31.858 --> 24:34.247
. . .so your wife wouldn't know
you were stepping out.

24:34.458 --> 24:37.370
SlMONE: You read about that
double homicide yesterday, Bob?

24:37.578 --> 24:41.127
We think it's the same guy.
We think he's back.

24:41.298 --> 24:43.892
We need to look at that bullet
you're carrying around. . .

24:44.098 --> 24:46.248
. . .to see if it matches
some others we've got.

24:46.418 --> 24:50.252
l was told there's no medical reason
to have that bullet removed.

24:50.418 --> 24:53.615
You want a reason? You made
a false statement to a police officer.

24:53.818 --> 24:56.013
You want us to file those charges
against you?

24:56.178 --> 24:58.328
You can explain to your wife
those charges.

24:58.498 --> 25:00.966
Come on, Bob, help us out.
All we want is the bullet.

25:01.138 --> 25:04.733
Your wife doesn't have to know
anything about the circumstances.

25:07.578 --> 25:10.968
Stacy's death was a horrible tragedy.

25:11.138 --> 25:14.972
l didn't want to compound it
by destroying my marriage.

25:15.778 --> 25:19.293
-Do you understand what l'm saying?
-Absolutely.

25:22.258 --> 25:23.976
When will this have to be done?

25:24.138 --> 25:27.175
Well, Bob, we need the bullet now.

25:27.898 --> 25:29.968
SlPOWlCZ:
The operation's a piece of cake.

25:30.658 --> 25:33.456
l had it on both cheeks.

25:35.938 --> 25:37.929
Okay.

25:40.258 --> 25:41.577
GRECO: Hey.
DONNA: Hi.

25:41.738 --> 25:43.330
-Nice blouse.
-Thank you.

25:49.058 --> 25:50.377
So, what do you hear, Vinnie?

25:50.538 --> 25:53.291
-Concerning?
-Concerning the time on this heist.

25:53.458 --> 25:56.336
Oh, yeah. Look, this is for you,
for your kids.

25:56.538 --> 25:59.132
Open it.

25:59.298 --> 26:01.368
That's genuine
Russian craftwork over there.

26:01.538 --> 26:03.210
''Made in Taiwan. ''

26:03.378 --> 26:04.606
You believe that?

26:04.778 --> 26:08.566
Farming out native goods like that.
But the design is completely authentic.

26:08.778 --> 26:11.770
-A time, Vinnie.
-Yeah.

26:11.938 --> 26:14.930
Just do me this one thing, all right?

26:16.098 --> 26:18.771
Don't get upset.
Don't get pissed off, all right?

26:18.938 --> 26:21.771
So l'm walking down the street,
and out of nowhere. . .

26:21.938 --> 26:25.772
. . .Alex, the kid who was with me and
Detective Stipowicz at the meeting. . .

26:25.938 --> 26:29.772
. . .he comes up to me, and he tells me,
now that this other guy is involved. . .

26:29.938 --> 26:33.533
. . .he wants to meet me and make sure
everything's okay with the artillery.

26:33.698 --> 26:36.690
Now, this meet, l know that l should
straighten it out with you.

26:36.858 --> 26:40.089
l should've been on that phone.
Slivowicz should've been there. . .

26:40.258 --> 26:42.613
. . .but this was something
l think l should do.

26:42.778 --> 26:46.698
So l go to the Odessa and meet with this
guy Vassily, who's with another guy. . .

26:46.698 --> 26:47.972
So l go to the Odessa and meet with this
guy Vassily, who's with another guy. . .

26:48.138 --> 26:50.652
. . .that you already know.

26:51.698 --> 26:53.575
lgor Pachenko.

26:54.138 --> 26:56.413
The man himself.

26:56.618 --> 26:59.371
There he is, all pudgy and hairy
with that Russian BO.

26:59.538 --> 27:01.369
What's up? Don't they have deodorant?

27:01.538 --> 27:03.688
lgor Pachenko's involved with this heist?

27:03.858 --> 27:06.418
-Yeah, he's in on everything they do.
-You met with him?

27:06.618 --> 27:09.576
Lieu, l know for a fact
the man gets a cut.

27:09.738 --> 27:13.651
l know he's involved.
These are his guys.

27:16.858 --> 27:19.292
Look, you need him at the meeting.

27:19.458 --> 27:23.736
You need him to be there.
l'll say he was there.

27:28.378 --> 27:32.451
l mean, it's-- lt's the ribbon
on the package.

27:32.658 --> 27:35.491
We both know this guy is wrong.

27:36.898 --> 27:40.288
Hey, look, l'll go to door number two.

27:42.338 --> 27:44.408
l'm prepared. . .

27:44.578 --> 27:47.251
. . .to testify in court. . .

27:47.578 --> 27:50.615
. . .that he was sitting right across
the way from me.

27:51.458 --> 27:52.686
That's some offer, Vinnie.

27:52.858 --> 27:56.328
-l know. lt'd be some collar for you.
-Mm-hm.

27:56.858 --> 27:59.133
-Capt. Fancy?
-Mm-hm.

28:01.178 --> 28:03.453
Son of a bitch.

28:04.658 --> 28:06.614
This-- This is like my worst nightmare.

28:06.778 --> 28:10.168
You were selling too hard, Vinnie.
Who's the bug for?

28:10.338 --> 28:13.967
You know what this is all about?
That prick Haverill.

28:14.818 --> 28:16.968
-Haverill had you do this?
-Yeah. l told him. . .

28:17.138 --> 28:19.254
. . .you wouldn't go for this
You'd be ahead. . .

28:19.418 --> 28:21.488
-. . .but he starts threatening.
-He threatened?

28:21.658 --> 28:23.057
Yeah, he threatened me.

28:23.218 --> 28:26.733
Some stickups the witness protection
people thought l pulled that l didn't.

28:26.898 --> 28:30.447
But he went on. But look, what he
wants, he wants to jam you, lieu.

28:30.618 --> 28:33.815
He wants to get you to get me to get--
You know, start lying for you.

28:33.978 --> 28:35.934
All right, so Pachenko isn't involved?

28:36.098 --> 28:40.376
No. From Miami to Moscow,
that's how far he is from this one.

28:40.538 --> 28:43.211
lt was Haverill all the time.

28:48.938 --> 28:50.974
l'm sorry.

28:52.338 --> 28:54.408
So now what do we do?

28:57.178 --> 28:58.975
You're gonna pull yourself together.

28:59.138 --> 29:00.491
You're gonna go back to him.

29:00.658 --> 29:03.889
Tell him the tape messed up, and
what does he want you to do? Take it.

29:04.058 --> 29:06.572
All right, anything to straighten
myself out with you. . .

29:06.738 --> 29:08.615
. . .but l don't exactly get the point.

29:08.778 --> 29:10.973
You're going back wired, Vinnie.

29:11.138 --> 29:15.893
Oh. You see? See, that's good.
That's smart.

29:20.378 --> 29:22.369
Get out of here.

29:23.538 --> 29:25.733
GRECO:
All right, all right.

29:26.418 --> 29:28.568
l'm sorry.

29:35.058 --> 29:36.332
SlMONE:
Listen to this.

29:36.498 --> 29:39.092
Webster moves in on this guy
and girl in the park, right?

29:39.258 --> 29:40.896
-This is August 1 7?
-Right.

29:41.058 --> 29:43.936
The guys runs, so Webster shoots
at him, puts a cap in his ass.

29:44.098 --> 29:46.532
But the guy gets away,
so now he's really pissed off.

29:46.738 --> 29:50.856
Or this girl does something to piss
him off, and Webster lays hands on her.

29:51.018 --> 29:53.851
Now, it's the very first time
he's laying hands on a victim.

29:54.018 --> 29:57.408
And it gets good to him, right?

29:58.858 --> 30:01.975
That's it. That's the transition.
That's where he makes the change.

30:02.178 --> 30:04.453
This bullet's gotta match
earlier Webster bullets.

30:04.618 --> 30:06.449
Yeah.

30:07.218 --> 30:09.288
You know what kind of pain
this guy will be in?

30:09.458 --> 30:12.097
He's not gonna sit right
for three months.

30:12.258 --> 30:14.613
Here's the bullet.
l can't tell the caliber.

30:14.778 --> 30:16.848
Thanks, doc.
We'll get that from Ballistics.

30:17.098 --> 30:21.410
-How's your rear?
-Not setting off any metal detectors.

30:30.938 --> 30:34.851
SOLOMON: We can be in and
out of there in no time at all.

30:35.138 --> 30:38.210
Excuse me a second.

30:38.378 --> 30:39.606
How'd you do at Ballistics?

30:39.818 --> 30:41.774
-We got a hit, lieu.
-He got a hit.

30:41.938 --> 30:45.055
There's over 90 percent likelihood
the bullet from this guy's ass. . .

30:45.218 --> 30:48.335
-. . .is out of the same gun as Webster.
-Don't get too comfortable.

30:48.538 --> 30:50.176
-You gotta go on a pickup.
-What?

30:50.458 --> 30:53.973
You had the Rudman girl's car run for
violations following the Hollis murder?

30:54.178 --> 30:54.858
-Yeah, yesterday. Why?
-The fax came in when you were out.

30:54.858 --> 30:57.326
-Yeah, yesterday. Why?
-The fax came in when you were out.

30:57.538 --> 31:00.336
Twenty minutes after Hollis was
recovered, a summons was. . .

31:00.538 --> 31:04.816
. . .issued to a George Putnam,
driving the dead girl's car.

31:04.978 --> 31:07.094
Then there is a good chance
that guy's Webster.

31:07.258 --> 31:09.692
-They're gonna pick him up.
-The task force is going?

31:10.338 --> 31:12.488

Solomon picked up the fax.

31:14.538 --> 31:17.416

-l'll drive.

One front entrance, one fire escape in
the rear of the building facing the alley.

31:37.578 --> 31:41.457
-Can we get into the back?
-Yeah, there's an alley. Pull right up.

31:41.658 --> 31:44.775
Solomon, we'll go in the front.
Strue and Vidalias, take the roof.

31:44.978 --> 31:46.730
You and Sipowicz cover the back alley.

31:46.898 --> 31:49.093
You don't want us to cover
the Port Authority. . .

31:49.258 --> 31:53.331

of what you were doing there.

Haverill sent Vinnie wired to me.
l sent him back.

Take that tape into the observation room
and shove it up Haverill's ass.

36:40.578 --> 36:42.967
-l'll move when the time's right.
-What about now?

36:43.178 --> 36:45.248
He wants a piece of that
armored-car collar.

36:45.418 --> 36:49.650
Wants to step out from that building like
J. Edgar Hoover when they shot Dillinger.

36:49.858 --> 36:52.656
That's when l wanna cut him off
at the knees.

37:11.698 --> 37:14.895
l'm gonna need about a half-hour.
l gotta fill out a five here.

-Repeatedly.
-l'm sick about this. lt's so humiliating.

37:36.578 --> 37:38.489
l popped him yesterday
on the same offense.

37:38.658 --> 37:42.094
Mr. Gumble's now volunteered to enter
therapy for this specific problem.

37:42.258 --> 37:44.692
No good will be served
by putting him into the system.

37:44.858 --> 37:47.850
-Are you sure about that?
-This man feels enormous remorse.

37:48.058 --> 37:52.176
This is a reputable citizen in the throes
of enormous emotional difficulties.

37:52.338 --> 37:55.171
lt's a second offense.
l will not let him walk on a DAT.

37:55.338 --> 37:57.090
He's gonna plead to a misdemeanor.

37:57.298 --> 37:59.653
ls that acceptable, Arnie?
You'll have a record.

37:59.818 --> 38:02.890

That would be acceptable.

Detective Lesniak. . .

GRABlNER: Okay.

38:08.298 --> 38:10.129
She could've said horrible things to me.

38:10.298 --> 38:14.769
This filthy, depraved behavior
deserves every vilification.

Oh, God.

38:17.658 --> 38:19.250
-Oh, God.

38:19.618 --> 38:20.846
Oh, God!

38:21.338 --> 38:23.329
-Look at this!
-Get him zipped up. . .

38:23.498 --> 38:25.887
-. . .and in that program right away.
-What is this?

38:26.098 --> 38:28.293
GRABlNER: Arnie!
GUMBLE: What are you doing to me?

38:28.458 --> 38:31.848

38:48.578 --> 38:51.411
Your dad's gonna be

38:51.858 --> 38:54.770
Can l get you something to drink?
A soft drink?

38:54.938 --> 38:58.931

-Okay. Well.

39:00.658 --> 39:02.774
Oh, you have fish too?

No problem, l was looking
at your fish tank.

39:22.018 --> 39:24.737
Yeah, l got it here.

39:25.498 --> 39:27.614
Well, l'm gonna go check
the leg of lamb.

39:31.418 --> 39:34.251
So how you been?

39:34.418 --> 39:37.296
Okay, good. Come on, sit down.

39:37.458 --> 39:39.892
-This place is nice.
-Yeah.

39:40.058 --> 39:41.889

This is much better.

What happened to your hair?
Did you lose a bet?

39:54.458 --> 39:56.847
l'm just warming up to a new look.

39:57.058 --> 40:02.291
l just took an induction physical
and my written test for the Air Force.

40:02.938 --> 40:04.769

40:04.938 --> 40:08.817

he's joining the Air Force.

He noticed my hair. . .

40:20.818 --> 40:24.094

they catch everything.

40:25.338 --> 40:26.771
You gonna be a pilot?

40:26.938 --> 40:28.769
No, l'd have to be an officer for that.

40:28.938 --> 40:32.931
That takes college,
but l'll definitely learn a trade.

40:35.778 --> 40:37.734
So, what do you think?

40:37.898 --> 40:39.377
l think it's a good idea.

40:39.538 --> 40:42.735
You're not mad that
we didn't talk about it?

40:45.538 --> 40:50.214

of talking things over.

40:52.338 --> 40:54.727

41:20.738 --> 41:22.698

something's come up here.

41:22.698 --> 41:24.131
Well, like l told you when l called you,
something's come up here.

41:24.298 --> 41:26.175

41:26.378 --> 41:27.606
Something with Webster?

41:28.258 --> 41:30.772
lt may turn out to be related.
lt may not.

41:30.978 --> 41:33.014

You running an interview?

41:33.178 --> 41:35.134

-Archie Solomon.
-Benita, l've always liked you.

41:40.578 --> 41:43.456
l'd just as soon not feel
like you're working me.

41:43.658 --> 41:46.297
lf you think all l'm doing here
is working a story. . .

41:46.458 --> 41:49.928
. . .then you're not as good a detective
as everyone says.

41:52.778 --> 41:55.531
-Arnold Rudman.
-Give him a break, Benita.

41:57.058 --> 41:58.810

42:00.698 --> 42:03.451

42:09.658 --> 42:11.728
Rain check on the dinner.

42:16.178 --> 42:18.214
How's it going, Mr. Rudman?

42:21.978 --> 42:23.889
Are there any developments?

42:24.058 --> 42:24.778
We're talking to someone.

42:24.778 --> 42:26.450
We're talking to someone.

42:27.338 --> 42:29.772
Maybe we'll have something
to tell you tomorrow.

42:32.818 --> 42:34.570
l don't know what to do with myself.

42:34.778 --> 42:36.370

42:38.538 --> 42:40.972
There's nothing l can do for her.

42:44.298 --> 42:46.732
Sometimes all you can do is wait.

43:06.258 --> 43:08.055
COSTAS:
Well, he sure had a good appetite.

43:08.218 --> 43:10.288
He cleaned his plate
and had two desserts.

43:10.458 --> 43:13.336
SlPOWlCZ:
Yeah, l think it went okay.

43:13.498 --> 43:15.853
Let him know we're together
and everything.

43:16.018 --> 43:18.327
lt went fine.

43:19.418 --> 43:24.048
You must be very proud of him,
going into the service.

43:24.218 --> 43:26.812
He'll be away, you know.
That's the only downside of it.

43:26.978 --> 43:30.095
You don't know
where he'll be stationed.

43:31.058 --> 43:34.095
We get along all right now, you know. . .

43:34.258 --> 43:37.011
. . .but the things you didn't do,
that's gone.

43:37.178 --> 43:40.136
The time to be a father
is when they're little.

43:41.058 --> 43:45.131
lf he didn't still need his dad's approval,
he wouldn't have come here tonight.

43:45.578 --> 43:48.775
There's so many things
l wanted to say to him.

43:48.938 --> 43:51.896
l didn't feel l had the right to tell him.

43:54.298 --> 43:56.653
Maybe it's Dan dying. . .

43:56.818 --> 44:00.413
. . .but l keep thinking
of all the chances lost.

44:04.178 --> 44:06.408
Ask me again, Andy.

44:08.818 --> 44:10.854
What do you mean?

44:14.138 --> 44:16.698
Ask me again.

44:27.818 --> 44:30.332
Will you marry me, Sylvia?

44:33.338 --> 44:36.694
Yes.
