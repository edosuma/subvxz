MAN ON TV: <i>And I'd like to say</i>
 <i>one more time, please,</i>

01:18.000 --> 01:21.501
 <i>please, watch</i>
 <i>the late show on Fox.</i>

01:21.501 --> 01:22.834
 <i>All we want is a chance.</i>

01:22.834 --> 01:26.234
 <i>Is that too much to ask for?</i>

01:28.234 --> 01:30.501
I'm home!

01:33.367 --> 01:36.267
No, no.
Don't mob me!

01:36.267 --> 01:38.834
I'm just
the breadwinner.

01:38.834 --> 01:40.067
No, don't push.

01:40.067 --> 01:42.968
You'll all get your chance
to hug and kiss me.

01:42.968 --> 01:45.067
Hey, Buck.

01:45.067 --> 01:48.934
I'm home, buddy.

01:50.934 --> 01:52.868
You shiftless,
thankless bag of--

01:52.868 --> 01:55.200
Go on.
Get off.

01:55.200 --> 01:57.601
Hey, where'd you get these?

01:57.601 --> 01:59.868
We don't keep any food
in the house.

02:00.834 --> 02:05.234
Al, I brought
you some ribs.

02:05.234 --> 02:07.234
I kept them in the bag
so they could soak

02:07.234 --> 02:09.400
in the grease
just like you like them.

02:09.400 --> 02:13.234
Al, you eat
like an animal.

02:13.234 --> 02:14.300
I didn't do this.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.501
Oh, you're going
to blame it on Buck?

02:16.501 --> 02:18.033
Well, look,
he's not even hungry.

02:18.033 --> 02:19.667
His bowl is still full.

02:19.667 --> 02:21.000
Hey, beef!

02:21.000 --> 02:23.100
Give it here.
It's Buck's, Al.

02:23.100 --> 02:24.834
Now listen,
you're always complaining

02:24.834 --> 02:27.133
I don't get you food,
so I got you ribs.

02:27.133 --> 02:28.934
Now I want you
to do something for me

02:28.934 --> 02:31.033
you've been promising
for a long time.

02:31.033 --> 02:32.200
What's that you say, Peg?

02:32.200 --> 02:35.767
I'm sorry, it's just
this darn headache.

02:35.767 --> 02:37.868
Not that.

02:37.868 --> 02:41.534
I meant something that would
require movement on your part.

02:44.534 --> 02:46.801
I want you to fix
the back fence.

02:46.801 --> 02:49.501
Wait a second, Peg,
why should I have to fix it?

02:49.501 --> 02:50.567
It wasn't me who said

02:50.567 --> 02:52.067
"Let's get a picture
of your mother

02:52.067 --> 02:53.968
leaning up
against the fence."

02:56.300 --> 02:58.334
It wasn't meant to support
a 200-pound woman

02:58.334 --> 03:01.934
with a keg under
each arm.

03:01.934 --> 03:04.667
It made a nice picture, Al.

03:04.667 --> 03:07.434
Now, look, the kids are getting
old enough to realize

03:07.434 --> 03:09.901
that it is not really
your part-time job

03:09.901 --> 03:13.234
to sit on the couch and test
the weight of beer cans.

03:13.234 --> 03:16.067
And now you won't
even fix the fence.

03:16.067 --> 03:18.200
What kind of an example
is that for them?

03:18.200 --> 03:20.200
Well, if we're
an example to the kids,

03:20.200 --> 03:22.801
Bud will grow up and get a job
that will slowly kill him.

03:22.801 --> 03:26.267
And Kelly, well she'll
grow up to believe

03:26.267 --> 03:30.367
that a two-income family
is a house with two husbands.

03:31.801 --> 03:34.067
Now don't start with that
"I don't do anything crap,"

03:34.067 --> 03:35.667
I take care
of your children.

03:35.667 --> 03:37.133
Mom, where's my socks?

03:37.133 --> 03:40.601
Honey, there's probably
a pair in the hamper.

03:42.834 --> 03:45.667
Anyhow, Al, that hole
is not only an eyesore,

03:45.667 --> 03:47.534
but, I mean, what about Buck?

03:47.534 --> 03:49.834
He could climb through,
and we'd never see him again.

03:49.834 --> 03:51.801
Oh, that's
a real danger, Peg.

03:51.801 --> 03:52.834
Watch this.

03:52.834 --> 03:54.767
Buck!
Come here, boy!

03:54.767 --> 03:55.767
Come on, Buck!

03:55.767 --> 03:56.767
Freedom, boy!

03:56.767 --> 03:59.400
Go!
Go, Buck!

04:01.067 --> 04:03.234
He's got about as much chance
of finding his way

04:03.234 --> 04:06.400
out of this house
as you do.

04:06.400 --> 04:08.634
It's not just Buck getting out.

04:08.634 --> 04:10.000
Other dogs are getting in.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.767
And they're using our yard
as a public rest room.

04:12.767 --> 04:15.501
All right.
All right!

04:16.733 --> 04:18.701
I'll fix it tomorrow.

04:18.701 --> 04:20.534
Thanks, Al.

04:20.534 --> 04:22.434
Can I get you
an aspirin?

04:22.434 --> 04:24.067
I don't have a headache.

04:24.067 --> 04:25.834
Well, good.

04:25.834 --> 04:27.634
Then that brings us
to another little chore

04:27.634 --> 04:31.701
our handyman's
been neglecting.

04:31.701 --> 04:35.067
Oh, gee, you better
bring me three, Peg.

04:36.767 --> 04:40.801
Ah, I guess I better get rid of
all the dirty work at one time.

04:42.367 --> 04:44.033
I'll do it after
I fix the fence.

04:44.033 --> 04:45.534
Ohh...

04:47.968 --> 04:49.567
It's been two months, Al.

04:49.567 --> 04:54.100
When are you gonna
fix the fence?

04:54.100 --> 04:55.968
Tomorrow, Peg.

04:55.968 --> 05:00.567
And that other thing
we talked about?

05:00.567 --> 05:02.834
Tomorrow, Peg.

05:02.834 --> 05:05.000
We're getting complaints
from the neighbors.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.767
What?

05:09.167 --> 05:13.100
Are we bringing down
the block's average?

05:15.133 --> 05:19.334
We'd bring down the average
at a nursing home.

05:19.334 --> 05:21.868
Look, I'm talking
about the fence.

05:21.868 --> 05:24.200
Remember how you said Buck
couldn't find his way out.

05:24.200 --> 05:26.033
Well, he found his way out

05:26.033 --> 05:29.000
and he has knocked up
every dog in the neighborhood.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.601
That's ridiculous, Peg.

05:31.601 --> 05:33.400
He's a lifeless lump.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.667
We had two kids.

05:37.334 --> 05:40.534
Then my work is done.

05:40.534 --> 05:42.667
Well, I'm sure he
didn't learn anything from you,

05:42.667 --> 05:44.434
but they're blaming
us anyway.

05:44.434 --> 05:46.167
[DOORBELL RINGS]

05:47.434 --> 05:48.601
I still can't believe it.

05:48.601 --> 05:49.734
How could that be?

05:49.734 --> 05:52.934
He tips over
when he lifts his leg.

05:54.367 --> 05:56.667
Mr. Pittman.

05:56.667 --> 05:58.300
My dog's been soiled, Bundy.

05:58.300 --> 05:59.767
I demand satisfaction.

05:59.767 --> 06:02.300
Me too.
Good luck.

06:04.634 --> 06:06.601
What are you talking about,
Pittman?

06:06.601 --> 06:09.968
My dog happens to be
a champion, purebred poodle.

06:09.968 --> 06:11.367
I was saving her
to be mated

06:11.367 --> 06:14.000
with the well-known
champion Zeus of Olympus.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.200
But what do I find
this morning when I come down

06:16.200 --> 06:17.968
to give my dog
her eyedrops?

06:17.968 --> 06:20.367
I find that...beast.

06:20.367 --> 06:24.534
With my champion
dowager Duchess of Kankakee.

06:24.534 --> 06:26.601
I had her tested, Bundy.

06:26.601 --> 06:29.734
She's impregnated.

06:32.300 --> 06:36.267
And now she's going to have
stupid, ugly puppies.

06:36.267 --> 06:40.434
I was going to make a lot
of money off a proper mating.

06:40.434 --> 06:45.100
That sort of makes you a dog
pimp, doesn't it, Pittman?

06:45.100 --> 06:46.501
And it also sort
of makes you

06:46.501 --> 06:49.767
the defendant in a lawsuit,
doesn't it, Bundy?

06:49.767 --> 06:53.033
You're slapping my dog
with a paternity suit?

06:53.033 --> 06:55.367
You must be out
of your mind.

06:55.367 --> 06:57.534
Al, you're not going
to believe what just happened.

06:57.534 --> 07:01.100
I just delivered
a litter of 11 puppies.

07:01.100 --> 07:04.334
The mother was under our house
undergoing a difficult labor,

07:04.334 --> 07:06.701
but luckily,
Steve took charge.

07:06.701 --> 07:11.334
The puppies are very cute,
but they seem awfully stupid.

07:13.234 --> 07:16.167
The wonder dog strikes again,
eh, Bundy?

07:16.167 --> 07:17.234
What's going on?

07:17.234 --> 07:20.634
Buck Bundy
impregnated my dog.

07:20.634 --> 07:21.901
Ohh...

07:23.100 --> 07:24.300
He's probably
getting out

07:24.300 --> 07:25.701
through that hole
in the fence, Al.

07:25.701 --> 07:27.868
You know, as I was
under our house,

07:27.868 --> 07:29.634
witnessing the miracle
of birth,

07:29.634 --> 07:32.801
it occurred to me
this whole despicable episode

07:32.801 --> 07:34.200
could have been avoided

07:34.200 --> 07:36.667
if owners would only have
their pets spayed or neutered.

07:36.667 --> 07:39.100
Well, that's an idea, Al.

07:39.100 --> 07:41.133
We could spay
or neuter Buck.

07:41.133 --> 07:44.367
Not a chance. Look, I'll just
fix the fence, okay?

07:44.367 --> 07:46.000
Oh, I don't think that'll
help much, Al.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.300
You know what they say--

07:47.300 --> 07:49.100
How you gonna keep
them down on the farm

07:49.100 --> 07:53.000
after they've poked <i>Paris?</i>

07:53.000 --> 07:55.300
You'll be hearing
from my lawyer.

07:55.300 --> 07:57.767
Oh, now,
Mr. Pittman, uh...

07:57.767 --> 07:59.701
Look, how about this?

07:59.701 --> 08:05.100
If Al gets his dog neutered,
will you forget about a lawsuit?

08:05.100 --> 08:07.734
Well, Looking around, it doesn't
look like I could get much.

08:07.734 --> 08:11.801
Looks like you've
already been sued by life.

08:11.801 --> 08:14.767
All right,
I'll accept those terms.

08:14.767 --> 08:17.901
But, Bundy, I don't want
your stupid dog

08:17.901 --> 08:19.968
around my poodle
ever again.

08:19.968 --> 08:21.367
And while we're
on the subject,

08:21.367 --> 08:24.200
keep your daughter
away from my son.

08:24.200 --> 08:28.200
Well, she was probably
just lending him a dress.

08:33.433 --> 08:35.667
Well, I guess
that goes to show you

08:35.667 --> 08:39.000
what can happen when
you use a little diplomacy.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.534
What a day, huh?

08:40.534 --> 08:41.868
I delivered a litter
of puppies

08:41.868 --> 08:43.467
and still had time
to save your bacon.

08:43.467 --> 08:46.334
Brewskies, all around.

08:46.334 --> 08:50.734
Well, Steve, what can I say,
except I wish you were dead?

08:50.734 --> 08:53.033
That's just Al's way of saying

08:53.033 --> 08:55.200
thanks for saving us
hundreds of dollars

08:55.200 --> 08:57.901
that would've taken
Al thousands of years to make.

08:57.901 --> 08:59.000
You're welcome.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.901
You're not. And I'm not
neutering my dog!

09:01.901 --> 09:04.601
That's the way God made him,
and that's how he's staying.

09:04.601 --> 09:07.801
Al, he's climbing over every dog
in the neighborhood.

09:07.801 --> 09:09.100
Why, because Pittman says so?

09:09.100 --> 09:10.467
How does he know?

09:10.467 --> 09:15.200
The spells sex 9-7-6.

09:15.200 --> 09:16.868
Now, look,
we all know Buck.

09:16.868 --> 09:19.834
Remember the time we had to pull
his head out of his water dish

09:19.834 --> 09:22.634
to keep him from drowning?

09:22.634 --> 09:24.334
He was only two, honey.

09:24.334 --> 09:26.701
Oh, please, the dog
isn't capable of thought,

09:26.701 --> 09:28.300
much less reproduction.

09:28.300 --> 09:30.000
I don't care what
anybody says,

09:30.000 --> 09:32.634
Buck is innocent
until proven guilty.

09:42.968 --> 09:45.601
Dad, the dogs
are in your bedroom.

09:47.133 --> 09:49.601
Well-- Do something!

09:50.701 --> 09:55.801
* When a man loves a woman *

09:55.801 --> 09:58.901
* Can't keep his mind
On nothing else... **

10:02.901 --> 10:04.334
Well, the dogs are gone.

10:04.334 --> 10:09.000
There was a line at the gate
too, but I got rid of them.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.200
Where were we?

10:10.200 --> 10:12.334
We were neutering the dog, Al.

10:12.334 --> 10:14.434
Oh, but honey,
before you take him down,

10:14.434 --> 10:17.534
could you ask him
for a few pointers?

10:19.133 --> 10:22.033
Well, one thing that seems
to work for him was

10:22.033 --> 10:23.234
there was no one
lying there

10:23.234 --> 10:25.767
yelling a bunch
of instructions at him.

10:28.634 --> 10:31.200
Well, you obviously didn't pay
attention to those charts

10:31.200 --> 10:33.501
I put up in the bathroom.

10:33.501 --> 10:36.968
Well, I thought that meant,
put the clothes in the hamper.

10:36.968 --> 10:39.334
You been missing
that too, Al.

10:39.334 --> 10:41.367
Uh, guys, please.

10:41.367 --> 10:43.901
Uh, look, Al, why don't you
just take him down,

10:43.901 --> 10:45.501
get him neutered
and be done with it?

10:45.501 --> 10:46.968
Because I'm not
neutering him.

10:46.968 --> 10:48.534
Oh, come on, Al.

10:48.534 --> 10:50.901
It is no big thing.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.934
Al, you'll really
be doing him a favor.

10:55.934 --> 10:58.634
I read that neutered dogs
live longer, they're calmer,

10:58.634 --> 10:59.868
and they're
more affectionate.

10:59.868 --> 11:03.601
Makes them more
affectionate, huh?

11:07.133 --> 11:10.033
He won't even notice
after a while.

11:10.033 --> 11:11.200
Believer me, Marce,

11:11.200 --> 11:13.000
it's the kind of thing
a guy would notice.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.067
Oh, come on, Al.

11:14.067 --> 11:16.434
It's a simple,
painless operation.

11:21.634 --> 11:25.300
I bought a male dog
because I wanted a male dog.

11:25.300 --> 11:27.267
He'll still be
a male dog.

11:27.267 --> 11:30.667
No, he won't be a male dog,
he'll be a thing.

11:30.667 --> 11:32.667
Like a...
like a girl.

11:32.667 --> 11:33.868
Listen, Al.

11:33.868 --> 11:35.167
Let's be practical.

11:35.167 --> 11:38.033
Mr. Pittman won't sue
if we have Buck neutered.

11:38.033 --> 11:40.167
And if the court
is gonna award anyone

11:40.167 --> 11:43.334
what's left of your money,
it's going to be me.

11:43.334 --> 11:44.367
Here, here!

11:44.367 --> 11:45.634
Come on, Peggy,

11:45.634 --> 11:47.801
I'll get you the numbers
of a couple of veterinarians

11:47.801 --> 11:49.667
we met at our animal
rights group.

11:49.667 --> 11:50.934
Oh, and while
you're there.

11:50.934 --> 11:52.868
You've got to see
my new fox jacket.

11:56.267 --> 12:01.467
Well, are you happy now,
Dr. Hack-em-off?

12:01.467 --> 12:03.133
Come on, Al.

12:03.133 --> 12:06.601
Deep down, you know it's
the best thing for him.

12:06.601 --> 12:09.934
You're making this sound
a lot more gruesome than it is.

12:09.934 --> 12:11.067
Oh, really, Steve?

12:11.067 --> 12:14.734
Why are your legs crossed?

12:14.734 --> 12:16.200
They're not.

12:16.200 --> 12:19.100
You know, I can't believe you're
not with me on this, Steve.

12:19.100 --> 12:21.968
I mean, you, me,
and Buck-- We're guys.

12:21.968 --> 12:23.567
We were put on this
earth to roam,

12:23.567 --> 12:26.267
to conquer...
to rule.

12:27.400 --> 12:30.133
Then we got married,
so it's over for us.

12:30.133 --> 12:33.100
But Buck--
he's in his prime.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.767
Look at him, Steve.

12:34.767 --> 12:37.133
You can't tell me
you're not a little envious.

12:37.133 --> 12:39.167
He's got the life.

12:39.167 --> 12:41.601
A new bitch every night--

12:41.601 --> 12:43.000
Doesn't have to take
them to dinner,

12:43.000 --> 12:44.701
he doesn't have
to dress up,

12:44.701 --> 12:46.334
he doesn't have
to take a bath,

12:46.334 --> 12:50.801
and best of all, they're not
there in the morning.

12:50.801 --> 12:55.834
Just woof, woof,
thank you, ma'am.

12:55.834 --> 12:59.901
Think about it, Steve.

12:59.901 --> 13:04.167
Well, I really
don't mind bathing, Al.

13:05.801 --> 13:08.634
Other than that, he's everything
I've ever wanted to be.

13:08.634 --> 13:10.367
Then be like me, Steve.

13:10.367 --> 13:11.868
Live through him.

13:11.868 --> 13:15.667
You saw that little
poodle he was with?

13:15.667 --> 13:19.234
How was she?

13:19.234 --> 13:22.300
What am I saying?
This is a dog.

13:22.300 --> 13:26.167
Marcie suggested this vet
that's not too far from us.

13:26.167 --> 13:28.968
And guess what, Al--
She's a woman.

13:28.968 --> 13:34.067
Of course. What does she do,
nag him till they drop off?

13:36.968 --> 13:40.767
Al, there is a stupid,
ugly puppy sale going on

13:40.767 --> 13:44.400
in every house
on the block.

13:44.400 --> 13:46.133
They know it's Buck.

13:46.133 --> 13:48.033
Wait a second, Peg.

13:48.033 --> 13:50.567
So it's all Buck's fault, huh?

13:50.567 --> 13:52.934
If these neighbors
don't want anymore puppies,

13:52.934 --> 13:54.801
let them spay
their dogs.

13:54.801 --> 13:57.801
Oh, that is so typically male.

13:57.801 --> 14:01.100
Birth control is always
the woman's responsibility.

14:01.100 --> 14:03.167
They have the babies.

14:03.167 --> 14:06.033
God, you're a pig.

14:07.300 --> 14:09.133
Well, it may surprise you, Al,

14:09.133 --> 14:10.734
but some feel that
responsibility

14:10.734 --> 14:11.934
should be shared
equally.

14:11.934 --> 14:12.968
Right, Steve?

14:12.968 --> 14:14.400
Right, dear.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.801
And some men even feel it's
their duty to assume the role

14:16.801 --> 14:18.000
of family planner.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.334
Right, Steve?
Right, dear.

14:19.334 --> 14:21.467
And after we have our
little boy and little girl,

14:21.467 --> 14:23.501
Steve's gonna have
a vasectomy.

14:23.501 --> 14:25.234
Right, Steve?

14:28.133 --> 14:30.467
Steve is going
to have what, dear?

14:30.467 --> 14:31.567
You know, Steve.

14:31.567 --> 14:33.133
Like Buck.
You'll live longer.

14:33.133 --> 14:34.601
You'll be calmer.

14:36.334 --> 14:38.100
Shut up, Al.

14:38.100 --> 14:39.634
Uh, dear...

14:39.634 --> 14:42.200
We never talked about
doing anything to, uh,

14:42.200 --> 14:44.167
Mr. Mike.

14:48.801 --> 14:50.501
Sure we did, Steve.

14:50.501 --> 14:53.267
We said once we had our
two children, we'd stop.

14:53.267 --> 14:57.567
I guess I read "stop" a little
differently than you did.

14:57.567 --> 15:00.200
Just how did you
read it, Steve?

15:00.200 --> 15:01.234
You're no better
than Al.

15:01.234 --> 15:06.334
Now, now, there
is no need for insults.

15:06.334 --> 15:09.334
Look, Marcie, all you
have to do is take a pill.

15:09.334 --> 15:11.133
The pill could be
dangerous, Steve.

15:11.133 --> 15:14.033
So could I, if you try
rewire my plumbing.

15:17.133 --> 15:18.667
This is just great.

15:18.667 --> 15:22.467
Buck's keeping his,
and Steve's losing his.

15:23.634 --> 15:25.434
Buck is not
keeping his.

15:25.434 --> 15:27.634
And Steve is not
losing his.

15:27.634 --> 15:30.000
Well, we'll see
about that.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.801
Come on, Steve,
we'll talk about this at home.

15:31.801 --> 15:33.400
I can't believe you,

15:33.400 --> 15:35.000
it's just a simple
little operation.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.901
Yeah, what if there's a slip?

15:36.901 --> 15:38.267
What if there's an earthquake?

15:38.267 --> 15:41.067
What if the doctor gets hiccups,
then where will I be, huh?

15:41.067 --> 15:44.400
Standing outside a harem door
in a diaper, that's where.

15:46.100 --> 15:47.667
He'll have it done.

15:47.667 --> 15:50.100
Anyway, honey, I'm gonna
make an appointment for you

15:50.100 --> 15:51.501
and Buck tomorrow at 10.

15:51.501 --> 15:53.934
Wait a minute, Peg, we're
going about this all wrong.

15:53.934 --> 15:55.934
It's not up to you.
It's not up to me.

15:55.934 --> 15:57.400
It's Bud's dog.

15:57.400 --> 15:59.000
Now you tell him we're
neutering his dog,

15:59.000 --> 16:01.100
and let him make
the decision.

16:01.100 --> 16:03.267
Bud, come down here!

16:06.868 --> 16:07.934
What, Dad?

16:07.934 --> 16:10.734
Honey, is it all right
if we neuter your dog?

16:10.734 --> 16:12.000
Sure.

16:18.334 --> 16:19.667
Aw, Peg...

16:19.667 --> 16:24.067
Tomorrow at 10, Al.

16:24.067 --> 16:25.634
Look at him.

16:25.634 --> 16:28.601
He knows.

16:28.601 --> 16:31.400
I've been looking
at him for three years.

16:31.400 --> 16:34.200
He knows nothing.

16:34.200 --> 16:36.767
That's not true, Peg.

16:36.767 --> 16:39.234
A hundred she-dogs
can't be wrong.

16:39.234 --> 16:41.934
He knows one thing.

16:41.934 --> 16:44.801
Well, I'm going up
to bed.

16:44.801 --> 16:46.200
Oh, and speaking
of that one thing,

16:46.200 --> 16:48.801
you want to come up
and join me?

16:48.801 --> 16:50.868
In a little while, Peg.

16:50.868 --> 16:53.434
I want to spend
the last night with my...

16:53.434 --> 16:55.534
entire dog.

17:00.367 --> 17:02.300
There's a woman for you.

17:02.300 --> 17:05.901
All day long, it's hack-em-off,
hack-em-off, hack-em-off.

17:05.901 --> 17:07.901
As soon as the sun goes down,
it's "Here, boy!",

17:07.901 --> 17:10.567
"Here, boy!", "Here, boy!"

17:14.501 --> 17:17.434
Listen, Buck, I tried, huh?

17:17.434 --> 17:19.267
You know I tried.

17:19.267 --> 17:21.767
You understand, huh?

17:23.800 --> 17:25.267
Ahh...

17:29.534 --> 17:31.934
I'm home, everybody!

17:31.934 --> 17:34.267
No, thank you.

17:34.267 --> 17:37.434
I don't need anything.

17:39.801 --> 17:41.367
Buck!

17:41.367 --> 17:42.534
Come here, boy!

18:00.100 --> 18:02.100
Hey, that looks good.

18:02.100 --> 18:04.868
Got one for me?

18:07.901 --> 18:10.934
Still mad because I got you
neutered, huh?

18:10.934 --> 18:13.901
What, do you want me
to dance for joy?

18:13.901 --> 18:15.400
Bring your pipe
and slippers,

18:15.400 --> 18:21.901
roll over so you can rub
my belly and see my shame?

18:23.400 --> 18:25.133
You know,
I thought you were

18:25.133 --> 18:26.267
supposed to be more
affectionate.

18:26.267 --> 18:27.467
Yeah, right.

18:27.467 --> 18:30.267
Why don't you poke my eyes out,
maybe that'd do it.

18:32.234 --> 18:34.400
[DOG BARKING]

18:34.400 --> 18:38.067
Yeah?
Not this year, honey.

18:38.067 --> 18:40.200
Aw, come on, Buck.

18:40.200 --> 18:42.801
You can't just sit around
feeling sorry for yourself.

18:42.801 --> 18:44.968
Hey, what do you say
we go for a walk.

18:44.968 --> 18:46.367
I hear they painted
the big hydrant

18:46.367 --> 18:48.267
at the end
of the corner.

18:48.267 --> 18:49.434
Nah.

18:49.434 --> 18:52.234
A lot of the male dogs
hang out there.

18:52.234 --> 18:54.434
All right,
let's clear the air here.

18:54.434 --> 18:56.801
This was for
your own good.

18:56.801 --> 18:58.467
Oh, thank you master.

18:58.467 --> 19:01.067
You know, my head is a great
source of pleasure to me too.

19:01.067 --> 19:03.501
How about cutting it off?

19:03.501 --> 19:07.067
Come on, Buck. Don't you think
I feel bad enough?

19:07.067 --> 19:08.234
No.

19:08.234 --> 19:10.234
What can I do to make
it up to you?

19:10.234 --> 19:13.067
I know, how about
a shiny new collar?

19:13.067 --> 19:14.367
Oh, yeah!

19:14.367 --> 19:18.167
That's much better
than what I had before.

19:18.167 --> 19:20.868
Gee, how about one
with studs?

19:20.868 --> 19:22.501
You know,
to impress the ladies.

19:22.501 --> 19:26.067
That is, before they find out
I'm a eunuch!

19:30.100 --> 19:31.167
Come on, boy.

19:31.167 --> 19:33.834
Keep your hands off me.

19:33.834 --> 19:36.400
Getting a little testy,
aren't you boy?

19:36.400 --> 19:38.934
Grr.

19:40.801 --> 19:43.000
Well, Bundy...

19:43.000 --> 19:47.767
I guess you're pretty
darn proud of yourself, huh?

19:47.767 --> 19:50.334
Aw, come on, Buck,
I tried to stop this.

19:50.334 --> 19:52.667
You might have
tried a little harder.

19:52.667 --> 19:54.667
I know, why don't
we do something

19:54.667 --> 19:56.367
to get your mind
off it.

19:56.367 --> 19:58.701
Hey, you want to watch
the Bears game?

19:58.701 --> 20:00.467
Oh, I don't know.

20:00.467 --> 20:02.501
I'm not much
into sports anymore.

20:02.501 --> 20:07.000
How about taking me
to a Peter Allen concert?

20:07.000 --> 20:09.701
Oh, what have I done?

20:09.701 --> 20:12.334
Oh, Buck, I didn't want
this to happen.

20:12.334 --> 20:13.734
I know you didn't, Bundy.

20:13.734 --> 20:17.701
That's what makes it
even harder to swallow.

20:17.701 --> 20:19.100
Ah, what's the difference?

20:19.100 --> 20:21.067
I'm sick of the sight of you.

20:21.067 --> 20:22.267
Where are you going?

20:22.267 --> 20:25.267
Oh, I guess I'll go out and...

20:25.267 --> 20:29.968
sniff a few butts
for old times' sake.

20:37.300 --> 20:39.133
Hi.

20:39.133 --> 20:44.100
We're insane killers.

20:46.334 --> 20:47.734
Sic 'em, Buck!

20:47.734 --> 20:49.801
Heh, heh.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.567
Buck!
Oh, Buck!

20:53.567 --> 20:54.934
Extra yummies!

20:54.934 --> 20:56.300
Aah!

21:07.400 --> 21:10.934
Well, today's the day.

21:10.934 --> 21:13.000
Do I have to, Peg?

21:13.000 --> 21:16.200
Oh, honey, everybody says this
is the best thing for Buck.

21:16.200 --> 21:17.801
We've had all the arguments

21:17.801 --> 21:20.334
and there is not one good
reason not to do this.

21:20.334 --> 21:22.033
He knows, Peg.

21:22.033 --> 21:25.200
Look how he's
looking at me.

21:25.200 --> 21:27.501
He's looking at me, Al,

21:27.501 --> 21:30.567
and he's thinking what everybody
who looks at me thinks--

21:30.567 --> 21:33.400
That poor woman.

21:33.400 --> 21:34.601
Just take him down.

21:34.601 --> 21:36.400
I'll go get his leash.

21:38.334 --> 21:40.300
BUCK:
 <i>You know what you have to do.</i>

21:46.334 --> 21:49.400
You look real nice today, Peg.

21:49.400 --> 21:51.634
Thanks, Al.

21:51.634 --> 21:55.300
Want to go upstairs?

21:57.000 --> 21:58.868
For what?

21:58.868 --> 22:03.000
It, Peg.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.501
I'm in the mood.

22:04.501 --> 22:06.033
Let's go.

22:08.400 --> 22:10.567
You can always
take Buck next weekend.

22:10.567 --> 22:13.367
That is, unless you're...

22:13.367 --> 22:15.834
busy next weekend.

22:15.834 --> 22:18.267
Go on upstairs, Peg.
I'll be right up.

22:18.267 --> 22:19.133
Oh...

22:25.501 --> 22:27.834
You owe me big.
