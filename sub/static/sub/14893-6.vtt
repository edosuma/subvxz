<i>This season on</i>
Political Animals...

00:03.162 --> 00:04.959
Come on, baby, say the words.

00:05.063 --> 00:06.758
I <i>am</i> gonna run for President...

00:06.864 --> 00:07.701
Without you.

00:07.802 --> 00:09.040
I am running against you.

00:09.142 --> 00:11.299
And I will resign in 48 hours.

00:11.734 --> 00:12.735
Annie, will you marry me?

00:12.803 --> 00:14.137
Yes.

00:14.204 --> 00:15.638
You know, working
with Anne on the

00:15.706 --> 00:17.006
engagement party
has been a dream.

00:17.074 --> 00:18.574
You don't make it easy
to love you.

00:18.642 --> 00:20.310
It's not supposed to be easy.

00:20.377 --> 00:21.911
Easy is where you can
spend the night

00:21.979 --> 00:23.046
while I'm moving out.

00:23.113 --> 00:24.747
My parents, they have spent
their lives putting

00:24.815 --> 00:26.215
this country before our family.

00:26.283 --> 00:28.184
Somebody has to put
our family first.

00:28.252 --> 00:29.552
We can't take another run.

00:29.620 --> 00:31.054
He's just pissed because

00:31.121 --> 00:34.424
his queer son was having
an affair with Reeves.

00:36.226 --> 00:38.061
You remember Susan Berg, right?

00:38.128 --> 00:39.095
Nice to see you again.

00:39.163 --> 00:40.963
You are gorgeous.

00:42.333 --> 00:43.499
<i>Before the suicide story broke,</i>

00:43.567 --> 00:44.901
<i>I went five months</i>
<i>without doing blow.</i>

00:44.968 --> 00:46.402
I was good, Dougie.

00:46.470 --> 00:48.671
We had a deal, and you
can't even go one day.

00:48.739 --> 00:49.672
Stop!
Without getting high?

00:49.707 --> 00:51.240
Sam, call an ambulance!

00:51.308 --> 00:52.542
<i>We made a choice, Bud.</i>

00:52.609 --> 00:54.744
We put our goals
for this country

00:54.812 --> 00:56.546
ahead of the well-being
of our child,

00:56.613 --> 00:58.715
and that is a decision we have
to live with

00:58.782 --> 01:00.283
for the rest of our lives.

before Garcetti does.

05:06.530 --> 05:08.564
But this is it.
We're even.

05:08.632 --> 05:11.300
No more double agent.
Of course. I understand.

05:11.368 --> 05:13.402
And you know, about what
happened between us before...

05:13.470 --> 05:15.137
Douglas, don't.
What happened on the plane

05:15.205 --> 05:17.840
was a mistake, okay?
I'm getting married.

05:17.908 --> 05:19.775
You mean you're not throwing off
your picture-perfect bride

05:19.843 --> 05:21.911
to share bunk beds with me
at my sister's?

05:21.979 --> 05:23.546
We're not in college.

05:23.614 --> 05:26.048
You don't need the one-night
stand breakup speech.

05:26.116 --> 05:28.084
I've heard it and given it.

05:28.151 --> 05:29.585
Just so you know,

05:29.653 --> 05:31.420
I don't normally do
that kind of thing.

05:31.488 --> 05:32.989
And I'm not the kind
of journalist

05:33.056 --> 05:34.156
who sleeps with her sources.

05:34.224 --> 05:35.291
So we're even now.

05:35.359 --> 05:38.394
Isn't that what you wanted?

05:38.462 --> 05:39.629
I should get back.

05:39.696 --> 05:41.697
I... I don't imagine
I have a lot of time

05:41.765 --> 05:43.766
before the news is official.

05:46.670 --> 05:47.837
Good-bye, Douglas.

05:47.904 --> 05:51.240
You're still a good guy...
even though you betrayed

05:51.308 --> 05:53.242
your mom and screwed around
on your fiancé.

05:53.310 --> 05:55.311
Somehow,
you are still a good guy.

05:55.379 --> 05:58.481
And I haven't met a lot
of those.

06:09.459 --> 06:10.660
Holy shit. This is huge.

06:10.727 --> 06:12.094
This changes
our entire timeline.

06:12.162 --> 06:14.497
We have to add this letter
to the story and run them ASAP.

06:14.564 --> 06:17.466
No. That is precisely
why I showed you this.

06:17.534 --> 06:19.168
You wanted to cover
this with me

06:19.236 --> 06:20.770
for a reason: respect.

06:20.837 --> 06:23.005
That takes crafting
and building a story,

06:23.073 --> 06:25.241
and it takes running it
at the right time.

06:25.308 --> 06:28.644
We... we have Elaine Barrish's
resignation letter.

06:28.712 --> 06:29.979
And when we run it,

06:30.047 --> 06:32.782
it will be the crown jewel
of the whole piece.

06:32.849 --> 06:34.750
If we drop this now...

06:34.818 --> 06:36.218
Then it's all about the letter.

06:36.286 --> 06:39.055
We'll get a huge headline,
agreed.

06:39.122 --> 06:40.856
But as journalists,
what have we accomplished?

06:40.924 --> 06:42.892
We got a piece of information.

06:42.959 --> 06:44.527
What's behind it?
Why did she write it?

06:44.594 --> 06:45.895
Why did she write it now?

06:45.962 --> 06:48.364
There are a thousand questions
that need to be asked

06:48.432 --> 06:50.066
and answered
before people read this.

06:50.133 --> 06:51.500
You're protecting her.

06:51.568 --> 06:55.204
I'm protecting the story and
my credibility with my source.

06:55.272 --> 06:57.540
I showed you this
against my better judgment

06:57.607 --> 07:00.843
because I thought
this was a <i>teachable</i> moment.

07:02.646 --> 07:04.880
Waiting for the announcement
was our deal,

07:04.948 --> 07:08.417
so that's what we're doing.

07:08.485 --> 07:09.652
We clear?

07:09.720 --> 07:10.853
Yeah, sure.

07:23.066 --> 07:25.101
I don't want to hold
you up, Mr. President,

07:25.168 --> 07:27.236
but I thought we should resolve
this before you leave.

07:30.707 --> 07:34.577
Handwritten
on official letterhead.

07:34.644 --> 07:36.445
Always a lady.

07:36.513 --> 07:39.782
I'll leave the timing of the
announcement to you, sir.

07:39.850 --> 07:42.685
Even with everything
we've been through,

07:42.753 --> 07:45.221
I'm gonna miss working
with you, sir.

07:46.923 --> 07:50.493
Why didn't you tell me what
Collier did to you and your son?

07:50.560 --> 07:53.229
Honestly? I was given the
impression that you knew.

07:53.296 --> 07:56.198
Elaine, how did we get to the
point where you actually believe

07:56.266 --> 07:57.867
I'd approve something like that?

08:01.938 --> 08:04.273
And Collier's telling, uh,

08:04.341 --> 08:06.709
telling everybody those bruises
were from a tennis match.

08:06.777 --> 08:08.310
They're not?

08:08.378 --> 08:10.212
Bud didn't tell you.

08:10.280 --> 08:11.947
He got them from your husband.

08:12.015 --> 08:13.415
Your ex-husband.

08:13.483 --> 08:14.850
Bud?

08:15.886 --> 08:18.220
My Bud?

08:18.288 --> 08:19.989
He punched the Vice President?

08:20.056 --> 08:21.323
Right up in the Oval.

08:21.391 --> 08:23.125
I had to pull him off my desk.

08:24.861 --> 08:26.929
Elaine, I can count
on my left hand

08:26.997 --> 08:29.698
how many people I admire
in government.

08:29.766 --> 08:31.267
You're one of them.

08:31.334 --> 08:33.402
Yes, sir.

08:33.470 --> 08:37.840
I've got the GEC this weekend
in Paris.

08:37.908 --> 08:40.142
When I get back...

08:40.210 --> 08:42.745
I'd like your decision.

08:42.813 --> 08:45.247
My decision?

08:46.516 --> 08:50.352
Don't quit this
administration, Elaine.

08:50.420 --> 08:54.290
Run with me.
Be my Vice President.

08:54.357 --> 08:55.391
Say yes this time.

08:55.458 --> 08:57.193
Mr. President...

08:57.260 --> 08:59.461
I'm not saying this
because I think you'll beat me.

08:59.529 --> 09:02.231
I'm saying it because
it's the right thing to do.

09:02.299 --> 09:05.267
We are better for this country
together than we are apart.

09:05.335 --> 09:07.002
You know it.

09:07.070 --> 09:09.104
I asked you once before
to be my Vice President,

09:09.172 --> 09:12.074
you said no. I let you.

09:12.142 --> 09:13.509
That was a big mistake

09:13.577 --> 09:18.314
for both of us.

09:18.381 --> 09:23.085
If I were to accept your offer--
and I'm not saying I would--

09:23.153 --> 09:26.755
I would have
to suspend my campaign.

09:26.823 --> 09:29.491
If you're not being completely
honest with me right now,

09:29.559 --> 09:31.427
I would be shit out
of luck, wouldn't I?

09:31.494 --> 09:32.928
Yep.

09:35.999 --> 09:37.733
"Please run with me"?

09:37.801 --> 09:39.835
I signed it
so you'd have proof.

09:41.371 --> 09:43.539
I put the "please" down there

09:43.607 --> 09:45.574
so you wouldn't think
it's an order.

09:45.642 --> 09:47.176
Thoughtful.
Yeah. Well...

09:49.179 --> 09:51.780
I'm not accepting
your resignation.

09:51.848 --> 09:54.283
Not today.

09:54.351 --> 09:56.719
So you still work for me.

10:00.056 --> 10:02.057
But I am ordering you
to think about it.

10:03.693 --> 10:05.294
Have a good trip, sir.

11:29.812 --> 11:32.080
Did he accept?
Do we have a date effective?

11:32.147 --> 11:33.948
Let's just get T.J.
settled first, okay?

11:36.619 --> 11:37.552
Hey, everybody!

11:37.620 --> 11:40.088
Oh, hey.
Hi, in here.

11:40.155 --> 11:41.623
Oh, sweetie.

11:41.690 --> 11:42.991
Welcome.
Mama.

11:43.058 --> 11:45.660
We stopped by T.J.'s
to pick up a few things.

11:45.728 --> 11:47.996
Oh, hitting the heavy stuff,
Nana, huh?

11:48.063 --> 11:51.633
Oh, I'm stocking up on
soda for both of us.

11:51.700 --> 11:56.170
And this time, I'm gonna
last longer, I promise.

12:00.242 --> 12:02.277
Margaret and I
fixed up your room.

12:02.344 --> 12:04.445
I'm sure you'll feel
very much at home.

12:04.513 --> 12:05.446
Well, uh...

12:05.514 --> 12:08.216
Look, this isn't my first rodeo.

12:08.284 --> 12:10.051
So I think I'm gonna
go lie down.

12:10.119 --> 12:12.186
The sedatives are
still in my system.

12:14.089 --> 12:16.024
Yeah, I...
I can get that, Dad.

12:16.091 --> 12:17.992
Thank you.

12:30.940 --> 12:32.540
Ha.

12:32.608 --> 12:35.443
Pathetic, huh?

12:35.511 --> 12:37.312
30 years old and
I'm living with my mother.

12:37.379 --> 12:38.479
Again.

12:38.547 --> 12:40.014
So, uh...
what's next?

12:40.082 --> 12:41.482
Are you gonna
go back into rehab?

12:41.550 --> 12:44.152
Because that's worked so well
for me in the past?

12:45.721 --> 12:47.655
You ever wonder how we
shared the same womb,

12:47.723 --> 12:49.624
but we turned out
so differently?

12:49.692 --> 12:52.427
Like I inherited all of
Dad's worst qualities,

12:52.494 --> 12:54.963
and you got all of
Mom's best ones.

12:55.030 --> 12:57.031
What are you talking about?

12:58.000 --> 12:59.867
I make mistakes, too.

13:01.303 --> 13:03.271
Big ones.
Yeah?

13:03.339 --> 13:05.707
Like what?

13:05.774 --> 13:07.442
Like... I'm...

13:07.509 --> 13:09.811
I'm just saying,
we're not that different.

13:14.717 --> 13:16.951
What's this?
Oh, Annie must have

13:17.019 --> 13:19.487
brought it over
from our apartment.

13:19.555 --> 13:21.723
You have a picture of the two
of us in your apartment?

13:21.790 --> 13:23.558
Dude, that's so gay.
Okay.

13:23.625 --> 13:26.361
It's not like I built
a shrine to it, all right?

13:26.428 --> 13:28.029
It was probably
in one of my albums.

13:28.097 --> 13:30.398
Aw, do you look at that every
night before you go to bed?

13:30.466 --> 13:32.266
I do.

13:33.902 --> 13:35.136
Grandpa Hammond's farm.

13:35.204 --> 13:37.205
Yeah, the summer before you
went off to boarding school.

13:37.272 --> 13:38.539
We had the whole
place to ourselves.

13:38.607 --> 13:40.141
I came out that year.

13:40.209 --> 13:41.409
Yeah.

13:41.477 --> 13:45.346
And Mom and Dad, um,
hired that tutor

13:45.414 --> 13:47.515
to help you, uh,
pass all those classes

13:47.583 --> 13:49.083
that you flunked.
Mallory.

13:49.151 --> 13:50.251
How hot was she?

13:50.319 --> 13:53.821
Shit, I...
I slept with her.

13:53.889 --> 13:55.223
Yeah, I know.
I did, too.

13:55.290 --> 13:57.025
Mallory.

13:57.092 --> 13:58.926
The summer that you came
out of the closet.

13:58.994 --> 14:01.362
I just... I mean,
I had to make sure.

14:01.430 --> 14:03.765
You know, every once in a while
I gotta sleep with a woman,

14:03.832 --> 14:05.166
to just... double-check.

14:05.234 --> 14:08.736
Look, they don't tell you
when you get the gay card

14:08.804 --> 14:10.772
that breasts are off the table.

14:10.839 --> 14:12.240
I mean, breasts are awesome.

14:17.579 --> 14:20.181
Grandpa Hammond's farm.

14:20.249 --> 14:21.549
Best summer ever.

14:21.617 --> 14:24.752
Don't you wish we could
go back there again?

14:27.122 --> 14:30.158
You took a swing at the Vice
President of the United States?

14:30.225 --> 14:32.093
Oh, please, it was
just a little slap.

14:32.161 --> 14:34.695
You know, I appreciate
your righteous anger

14:34.763 --> 14:36.230
in defense of our son.

14:36.298 --> 14:38.933
And I will even admit
to a certain amount of pleasure

14:39.001 --> 14:40.535
at the thought of it,

14:40.602 --> 14:42.870
but once again, you have set off

14:42.938 --> 14:45.840
a shitstorm
of historical proportions.

14:48.310 --> 14:50.411
If you say
that you planned this,

14:50.479 --> 14:51.979
I swear to God,
I'll strangle you.

14:55.951 --> 14:57.351
Well...

14:57.419 --> 15:02.290
occasionally, I can
still be surprised.

15:02.357 --> 15:04.692
See, if Garcetti wants you
to run with him,

15:04.760 --> 15:06.794
it's not 'cause I reminded him

15:06.862 --> 15:09.430
what a dickless bastard
Collier is.

15:09.498 --> 15:11.999
It's 'cause it's
the right thing to do.

15:12.067 --> 15:15.403
So, I suppose he wants to wait
till the convention

15:15.471 --> 15:17.271
before he chops Collier's head off.
Smart, huh?

15:17.339 --> 15:19.474
Yeah.

15:19.541 --> 15:21.442
That's it?

15:21.510 --> 15:26.514
Bud, in 30 years, I have never
had to ask you for your opinion.

15:26.582 --> 15:28.983
I'm starting to think one
of us is having a stroke.

15:29.051 --> 15:31.285
All right.

15:31.353 --> 15:33.454
I believe you can
still beat Garcetti.

15:33.522 --> 15:35.623
But I no longer believe
you want to beat him.

15:35.691 --> 15:37.959
I think that, uh, sub crisis,

15:38.026 --> 15:39.627
doused the fire in your belly,

15:39.695 --> 15:41.262
and you think maybe
there's a core of goodness

15:41.330 --> 15:43.598
in the man, and he's
just lost his way.

15:43.665 --> 15:45.733
You see, that's your
lot in life, Elaine,

15:45.801 --> 15:48.102
to see the goodness
in flawed men.

15:48.170 --> 15:49.971
Hell, it's why you married me.

15:50.038 --> 15:52.640
Well, I also divorced you.

15:52.708 --> 15:54.075
And yet here I am,

15:54.143 --> 15:57.912
in your house,
surrounded by our family.

15:57.980 --> 16:00.781
And I'm still basking in the
warm glow of making love to you

16:00.849 --> 16:02.116
not one month ago.

16:02.184 --> 16:03.417
Don't press your luck, Bud.

16:03.485 --> 16:04.852
Oh, baby, as long as there's

16:04.920 --> 16:06.587
an ounce of luck left to press,

16:06.655 --> 16:08.256
I'm gonna press it.

16:18.167 --> 16:19.133
Shit.

16:19.201 --> 16:20.234
Georgia, please.

16:20.302 --> 16:22.136
Please tell me
that you didn't...

16:22.204 --> 16:23.905
You have the resignation letter?

16:23.972 --> 16:25.907
You would burn down
this building

16:25.974 --> 16:27.775
if it would advance your
career a half an inch,

16:27.843 --> 16:29.410
you stupid little girl!

16:29.478 --> 16:31.746
Oh, please, like
we are any different.

16:31.813 --> 16:33.781
I'm just younger than you,
by a lot.

16:33.849 --> 16:35.283
Georgia, can you
give us a minute?

16:35.350 --> 16:37.351
I need to talk to Susan alone.

16:42.391 --> 16:44.125
We're running that letter.

16:44.193 --> 16:46.027
We can't sell out
a confidential source.

16:46.094 --> 16:47.295
We're not naming your source.

16:47.362 --> 16:50.031
Publishing that piece
will essentially identify

16:50.098 --> 16:51.766
and burn my source
without naming them.

16:51.833 --> 16:53.568
You don't have to say "them."
You can say "him."

16:53.635 --> 16:54.735
Douglas Hammond.

16:56.305 --> 16:58.606
I have serious questions
whether your relationship

16:58.674 --> 17:00.675
with several Hammond
family members

17:00.742 --> 17:03.678
has exceeded the bounds of
proper, professional contact.

17:03.745 --> 17:05.213
You're one to talk.

17:05.280 --> 17:07.615
The only reason you
know about that letter

17:07.683 --> 17:09.817
is because you're still
sleeping with... that.

17:09.885 --> 17:13.154
Look, I allowed you latitude
with the Hammonds before

17:13.222 --> 17:14.755
so you could pursue
the bigger story.

17:14.823 --> 17:16.457
Now that we have it,

17:16.525 --> 17:19.627
the paper cannot afford
the perception of favoritism.

17:24.233 --> 17:26.000
<i>Alex knows it's you.</i>

17:26.068 --> 17:28.236
He knows there's a letter,
and he is running it.

17:28.303 --> 17:29.604
There's nothing I can do.

17:29.671 --> 17:30.871
But you promised.

17:30.939 --> 17:32.573
I know. And I'm sorry.

17:32.641 --> 17:34.475
This is it. Okay?

17:34.543 --> 17:37.011
Forget my career, it's over.

17:37.079 --> 17:40.581
My mother, no one,
will ever trust me again.

17:40.649 --> 17:43.217
There is a way I can
still protect you.

17:43.285 --> 17:45.086
You're not my only
State Department source.

17:45.153 --> 17:47.622
If you need a name for the leak,
I can give you one.

17:47.689 --> 17:49.090
And throw some innocent
civil servant under the bus?

17:49.157 --> 17:50.891
As cynical as it is,
it's the world we live in.

17:50.959 --> 17:52.193
If you're not
getting screwed over,

17:52.261 --> 17:53.527
you're screwing
over somebody else.

17:53.595 --> 17:55.363
You don't want to do that.
No.

17:55.430 --> 17:56.731
But I want to help you.

17:56.798 --> 18:00.134
If I named someone...

18:00.202 --> 18:03.504
we'd be no better than
the people we despise.

18:04.740 --> 18:07.341
And I already don't
sleep at night...

18:12.781 --> 18:14.949
So what are you going to do?

18:24.660 --> 18:26.460
Afraid I can't let you do that.

18:26.528 --> 18:28.129
I've been given instructions

18:28.196 --> 18:29.630
not to let anyone
leave the premises.

18:29.698 --> 18:31.699
What is this?
I'm on lockdown now?

18:31.767 --> 18:32.967
Just following orders.

18:33.035 --> 18:35.236
What's going on, fellas?
Nana, will you please

18:35.304 --> 18:37.772
tell Agent Clark that I don't
need a goddamn baby-sitter?

18:37.839 --> 18:38.806
It's okay, Clark.

18:38.874 --> 18:40.408
I'll handle him.
Yes, ma'am.

18:40.475 --> 18:41.976
Nana, what is it?
I gotta run some errands.

18:42.044 --> 18:44.578
Oh, yeah?
What kind?

18:44.646 --> 18:47.415
Like maybe tracking down your
dealer to score some coke?

18:47.482 --> 18:49.483
Or finding some nameless boy

18:49.551 --> 18:52.153
to screw and do
a little blow with?

18:52.220 --> 18:53.954
Anne and I found your stash.

18:54.022 --> 18:56.090
We dumped it.
You're one to talk.

18:56.158 --> 18:58.492
Where you hiding your liquor
since I've been home?

18:58.560 --> 19:00.294
Mom says the house is clean.
Bullshit.

19:00.362 --> 19:02.096
I don't need a drug
addict like you

19:02.164 --> 19:04.298
to tell me that
I'm a boozehound.

19:04.366 --> 19:06.367
Now, you want to go outside
and do some "errands,"

19:06.435 --> 19:07.601
well, go right ahead, honey,

19:07.669 --> 19:09.870
Go on.
I'm not gonna stop you.

19:09.938 --> 19:12.840
But just remember this,
if you go out that door,

19:12.908 --> 19:16.544
that is your choice,
and nobody else's!

19:29.124 --> 19:30.424
What's wrong?

19:30.492 --> 19:32.159
You're shaking.

19:32.227 --> 19:34.261
You think it's easy?

19:34.329 --> 19:37.331
Taking a chance you'll
never come back home again?

19:37.399 --> 19:39.033
But there's no other way.

19:42.070 --> 19:43.971
I'm scared, too.

19:44.973 --> 19:45.940
Oh, God...

19:46.007 --> 19:48.943
I remember you when
you were a little kid.

19:49.010 --> 19:50.311
You were always so happy.

19:50.379 --> 19:52.513
Dougie was the tortured one,

19:52.581 --> 19:56.384
but you were just
full of smiles and light

19:56.451 --> 19:57.918
all the time.

19:57.986 --> 19:59.887
What happened, T.J.?

20:04.226 --> 20:06.227
I-I don't know.

20:08.230 --> 20:10.431
I stopped being me such
a long time long ago,

20:10.499 --> 20:13.501
I can't even remember
who that was.

20:16.004 --> 20:17.772
Guess the only
thing that makes me

20:17.839 --> 20:21.442
feel like myself these
days is when I'm not.

20:23.311 --> 20:26.480
But you've got
your whole life ahead of you.

20:26.548 --> 20:29.316
You know,
with your crappy genetics

20:29.384 --> 20:32.486
and the awful choices
you've made so far,

20:32.554 --> 20:36.824
you're going to have
to fight for it.

20:36.892 --> 20:38.726
But it's worth it, honey.

20:38.794 --> 20:39.727
It is.

20:39.795 --> 20:41.762
But you have to fight for it!

20:50.772 --> 20:51.772
Oh.

20:56.178 --> 20:57.945
Oh.

21:01.616 --> 21:02.716
Hi.

21:02.784 --> 21:04.285
You know, I don't
think Sophia's

21:04.352 --> 21:05.386
quite nailed this.

21:05.454 --> 21:07.321
I'd like you
to take a look at it.

21:07.389 --> 21:09.290
I mean, it's... it's okay,

21:09.357 --> 21:10.291
but it's just...

21:10.358 --> 21:12.893
Um...

21:12.961 --> 21:15.196
Susan Berg is running a story

21:15.263 --> 21:16.597
about your presidential
aspirations.

21:16.665 --> 21:17.731
Keeping up with

21:17.799 --> 21:18.933
the chatter, I guess.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.134
Just take a look at...

21:20.202 --> 21:22.803
It's not
a speculative piece, Mom.

21:22.871 --> 21:24.104
She knows what donors

21:24.172 --> 21:26.207
we've reached out to.

21:26.274 --> 21:29.276
She's gotten hold of
Jubal Jacobs's research in full,

21:29.344 --> 21:33.881
and she has your resignation
letter, from this morning.

21:33.949 --> 21:35.483
She can't have
my resignation letter,

21:35.550 --> 21:37.618
because only two or three people
in the world

21:37.686 --> 21:38.619
even know it exists.

21:38.687 --> 21:40.287
I'm the source.

21:40.355 --> 21:45.092
Everything that she knows,
I gave it to her.

21:45.160 --> 21:47.661
I thought that another run

21:47.729 --> 21:49.463
would destroy this family.

21:49.531 --> 21:54.068
And I didn't think that you had
a chance of winning.

21:54.135 --> 21:56.937
Now, just hear me out
for a second.

21:57.005 --> 22:02.009
Now, after Jubal,
I tried to stop it, Mom.

22:02.077 --> 22:03.744
I-I really did,
but it was too late.

22:03.812 --> 22:07.014
And I got her to stay silent
for as long as I could...

22:07.082 --> 22:10.751
So all this time, you have just
been pretending to support me?

22:10.819 --> 22:12.653
At first, yes.

22:12.721 --> 22:14.989
But then we got
Jubal's research,

22:15.056 --> 22:17.658
and suddenly
everything seemed possible.

22:17.726 --> 22:19.527
And I was, I-I was
trying to unravel

22:19.594 --> 22:21.529
what I had done, Mom...
Jesus, Douglas.

22:23.565 --> 22:24.865
Yeah, I screwed up.

22:24.933 --> 22:26.734
Screwed up?

22:26.801 --> 22:30.104
The access you gave this
woman, this journalist,

22:30.171 --> 22:32.339
my letter--

22:32.407 --> 22:34.108
everyone will know
it came from you.

22:34.175 --> 22:34.975
I know.

22:35.043 --> 22:37.511
I don't think you do.

22:37.579 --> 22:40.548
Tell me, just exactly how did
you think this would end?

22:42.584 --> 22:45.119
After you told me
that you were gonna run,

22:45.186 --> 22:47.354
I gave you a dozen reasons
not to.

22:47.422 --> 22:49.156
Well, that would've been
the time to say no

22:49.224 --> 22:50.491
to running my campaign.

22:50.559 --> 22:53.661
Well, I have zero experience
saying no to you.

22:53.728 --> 22:55.829
I'm 30 years old,
and my worst nightmare

22:55.897 --> 22:57.464
is letting my mother down.

22:57.532 --> 23:01.502
Well, you've certainly done that
with flying colors.

23:03.204 --> 23:05.172
You should go.

23:05.240 --> 23:06.941
So that's how
it's gonna be, Mom?

23:07.008 --> 23:09.143
I get the famous
Elaine Barrish ice-out.

23:09.210 --> 23:10.544
Huh?

23:10.612 --> 23:13.147
I go permanently
into the enemy column, Mom?

23:13.214 --> 23:14.949
Just another person
that let you down,

23:15.016 --> 23:16.483
that didn't live up to

23:16.551 --> 23:17.484
your impossible expectations?

23:17.552 --> 23:18.719
Forget everything
that I've done

23:18.787 --> 23:21.689
or that my entire adult life
has been dedicated

23:21.756 --> 23:23.123
to making your life
better and easier!

23:23.191 --> 23:25.492
Well, I'm sorry.

23:25.560 --> 23:28.395
I am sorry that I am
such a disappointment.

23:38.848 --> 23:40.549
<i>Can I just vent for a second?</i>

23:40.617 --> 23:42.484
Okay, the new client
that I have, the socialite--

23:42.552 --> 23:43.919
she has this harpsichord, okay,

23:43.987 --> 23:45.988
and she wants me
to design around it.

23:48.324 --> 23:49.424
What's going on, Douglas?

23:49.492 --> 23:51.527
Well, um, I got into
a big fight with my mom.

23:51.594 --> 23:55.030
And she yelled, and I yelled
back, and it got pretty ugly,

23:55.098 --> 23:57.199
and I definitely don't
have a job there anymore.

23:57.267 --> 23:58.367
But I don't give a shit,

23:58.434 --> 24:00.569
because you know what I do
care about, Annie? You.

24:00.637 --> 24:04.439
You are the only thing
that matters to me.

24:04.507 --> 24:05.874
Marry me.

24:06.976 --> 24:08.844
Haven't we been through this?

24:08.912 --> 24:09.845
Now.

24:09.913 --> 24:10.846
Let's elope.

24:10.914 --> 24:11.914
Hey, we'll leave tonight.

24:11.981 --> 24:13.315
All right? What are
we waiting for?

24:13.383 --> 24:15.184
A roomful of people
smiling that we don't know,

24:15.251 --> 24:17.886
staring at us, gawking at us,
or some spread in <i>Vanity Fair?</i>

24:17.954 --> 24:19.054
It shouldn't be like that.

24:19.122 --> 24:20.189
It should be about us.

24:20.256 --> 24:21.456
Should be about you and me.

24:23.493 --> 24:25.160
Are you serious?

24:25.228 --> 24:26.328
I've never been more serious

24:26.396 --> 24:27.796
about anything in
my entire life.

24:29.832 --> 24:31.133
So, is that a yes, then?

24:31.201 --> 24:32.167
Yes?

24:32.235 --> 24:34.069
Yes.
Yes.

25:06.135 --> 25:09.705
I really thought
we'd made a connection here.

25:09.772 --> 25:12.074
I felt I could trust you.

25:12.141 --> 25:16.211
But you've been using me
and using my son.

25:16.279 --> 25:17.412
Just like you've been using me.

25:17.480 --> 25:19.248
And you lied to me, said
you weren't running.

25:19.315 --> 25:20.949
That's not the kind of thing
you tell a reporter.

25:21.017 --> 25:23.018
You say it to someone you
have a connection with.

25:25.054 --> 25:27.289
And if I had told you,
would you have told me

25:27.357 --> 25:29.091
that you were
working covertly on a piece

25:29.158 --> 25:31.126
about my intentions to run?

25:31.194 --> 25:32.628
I don't know.

25:32.695 --> 25:34.296
But you didn't give
me that chance.

25:35.331 --> 25:37.466
No.

25:37.533 --> 25:38.900
No, I didn't.

25:38.968 --> 25:42.337
If you run that story,

25:42.405 --> 25:46.708
everyone in D.C. will know
that Douglas was your source.

25:46.776 --> 25:50.545
It will destroy any
political career he might have.

25:50.613 --> 25:52.914
'Cause if he would
do this to his own mother...

25:52.982 --> 25:54.483
No one else will ever
trust him again.

25:54.550 --> 25:56.018
I know.
Exactly.

25:59.822 --> 26:02.824
Besides, none of it
is true anymore.

26:02.892 --> 26:04.626
What?

26:04.694 --> 26:06.128
I would like to share
with you something

26:06.195 --> 26:10.098
that only two other people
in the world are privy to.

26:10.166 --> 26:13.769
But I really have to know
that I can trust you.

26:13.836 --> 26:18.907
Not as a reporter,
trust you as a human being.

26:18.975 --> 26:20.709
Yeah.

26:24.213 --> 26:27.582
The president would not
accept my resignation.

26:27.650 --> 26:29.918
He wants me to stay on at State

26:29.986 --> 26:32.754
and run with him
in the next election

26:32.822 --> 26:34.156
as his vice president.

26:34.223 --> 26:37.292
And you're accepting his offer?

26:42.465 --> 26:44.099
Why?

26:44.167 --> 26:48.103
I have one son
who has nearly died twice

26:48.171 --> 26:50.372
in the last six months.

26:50.440 --> 26:55.544
My other son--
there is a confusion

26:55.611 --> 26:58.547
and an anger there that I am
just beginning to see.

26:58.614 --> 27:03.618
They're both adults,
but they're still my children.

27:03.686 --> 27:09.424
It's not the right time
to take on my boss or my party.

27:09.492 --> 27:11.393
I am their mother first.

27:11.461 --> 27:15.597
It's the best story
I'll ever get.

27:15.665 --> 27:18.800
And you just told
me so I won't run

27:18.868 --> 27:20.736
the second best
story I ever got.

27:20.803 --> 27:23.872
Well, I did ask
if I could trust you.

27:23.940 --> 27:25.407
You can.

27:28.044 --> 27:29.244
<i>It's a nonstory.</i>

27:29.312 --> 27:31.413
Even if Barrish
decided not to quit,

27:31.481 --> 27:32.814
she still wrote a
letter proclaiming

27:32.882 --> 27:34.783
all the reasons that
she was quitting.

27:34.851 --> 27:36.651
There's no mulligan on
something like this.

27:36.719 --> 27:39.221
I don't want to make my career
destroying another person's--

27:39.288 --> 27:41.623
her career-- anymore.

27:41.691 --> 27:43.058
I-I'm sick of it.

27:43.126 --> 27:44.593
I get your obsession
with Elaine Barrish.

27:44.660 --> 27:45.927
Actually, I...

27:45.995 --> 27:47.562
I actually understand
why you want

27:47.630 --> 27:48.997
to protect her and her family.

27:49.065 --> 27:51.733
But we have the letter,
we-we have to run it.

27:51.801 --> 27:52.768
That's our job.

27:52.835 --> 27:54.436
We don't pick sides
of the truth,

27:54.504 --> 27:57.739
we report it.

27:57.807 --> 28:01.143
It's not the whole truth.

28:02.645 --> 28:04.846
I slept with my source.

28:04.914 --> 28:06.448
I slept with Douglas Hammond.

28:06.516 --> 28:09.184
I'm-I'm not entirely sure that's
why he gave me the letter,

28:09.252 --> 28:12.854
but I'm pretty sure it had
something to do with it.

28:16.292 --> 28:18.960
God, Susan,
if we had run that letter

28:19.028 --> 28:19.961
and printed that letter...

28:20.029 --> 28:21.129
I know, Alex.
I know, okay?

28:21.197 --> 28:22.197
Oh, you know?
You know?

28:22.265 --> 28:23.565
You really know?

28:23.633 --> 28:26.134
This paper, you know,
it's already on the brink.

28:26.202 --> 28:28.904
A scandal like this,
with somebody of your stature--

28:28.971 --> 28:30.972
it would ruin this place.

28:31.040 --> 28:35.110
If you're going to fire me,
please just do it already.

28:41.951 --> 28:43.952
Y-You never said
what you just said.

28:44.020 --> 28:45.253
I never heard it.

28:45.321 --> 28:47.289
Go back to your office.

28:47.356 --> 28:49.291
Go!

29:01.504 --> 29:04.439
Oh.

29:04.507 --> 29:06.141
How's T.J.?

29:06.209 --> 29:08.009
Oh, T.J.'s fine.

29:08.077 --> 29:10.812
He and Margaret are
upstairs playing Scrabble.

29:10.880 --> 29:14.583
Neither of them is drinking.

29:14.650 --> 29:18.520
Well, have a soda.

29:18.588 --> 29:20.388
Have you spoken to Douglas?

29:20.456 --> 29:22.023
Uh, no. Why?
Madam Secretary!

29:22.091 --> 29:23.091
In here.

29:23.159 --> 29:24.426
Number four is secure,
number four is secure.

29:24.494 --> 29:25.427
Bobcat secure,

29:25.495 --> 29:26.428
Bobcat secure.

29:26.496 --> 29:27.929
What's going on?

29:27.997 --> 29:29.364
There's been an accident.

29:41.811 --> 29:43.078
You can't do this to me, Alex.

29:43.145 --> 29:44.646
That was supposed to be
my big break!

29:44.714 --> 29:46.314
The fact that she's not
resigning means it's D.O.A.

29:46.382 --> 29:47.349
I'm spiking it.

29:47.416 --> 29:48.817
There are other people
I can go to.

29:48.851 --> 29:49.784
I'll go to Seavers.

29:49.852 --> 29:50.986
You want to go above my head,

29:51.053 --> 29:52.053
Georgia, be my guest.

29:58.060 --> 29:59.995
Oh, my God.

30:02.498 --> 30:04.099
I repeat, Air Force One,

30:04.166 --> 30:07.969
the president's plane,
has crashed on approach

30:08.037 --> 30:10.005
to landing in Biarritz, France.

30:10.072 --> 30:11.740
The cause of the accident
is unknown,

30:11.807 --> 30:14.976
but early reports indicate
a mechanical malfunction.

30:15.044 --> 30:17.312
Eyewitnesses say
the plane lurched

30:17.380 --> 30:18.813
and pinwheeled into the ocean.

30:18.881 --> 30:22.651
President Garcetti was on board,
along with White House staffers,

30:22.718 --> 30:25.453
Secret Service
and Air Force One personnel.

30:25.521 --> 30:27.389
34 people in all.

30:27.456 --> 30:29.157
French authorities
have dispatched

30:29.225 --> 30:32.160
hundreds of search boats,
looking for any sign of life

30:32.228 --> 30:34.296
amidst the wreckage
in the water below.

30:34.363 --> 30:36.665
Six rescue planes are also
flying over this crash site

30:36.732 --> 30:40.993
and have been dropping life
rafts into the water...

30:58.882 --> 31:01.650
Authorities continue
<i>their search for survivors</i>

31:01.718 --> 31:03.352
<i>of the Air Force One tragedy.</i>

31:03.420 --> 31:04.453
<i>The French Government</i>

31:04.521 --> 31:06.422
has dispatched hundreds
of search boats

31:06.489 --> 31:08.824
looking for any sign of life
amidst the wreckage.

31:08.892 --> 31:10.793
President Harbin
of France on Skype.

31:10.860 --> 31:12.461
Put her through.

31:14.764 --> 31:16.165
Any word from Douglas?

31:16.232 --> 31:17.199
Networks are saturated.

31:17.267 --> 31:18.700
Got one through,
left a voice mail.

31:21.438 --> 31:23.605
Madam Secretary.

31:23.673 --> 31:24.773
Madam President.

31:24.841 --> 31:27.342
Your country has mounted
a heroic rescue effort

31:27.410 --> 31:29.244
and moved so swiftly.

31:29.312 --> 31:30.646
We're deeply grateful.

31:30.713 --> 31:32.714
If my plane were down
off Miami Beach,

31:32.782 --> 31:34.283
you would do every bit as much.

31:34.350 --> 31:36.819
With your permission, we have
a team on the tarmac here,

31:36.886 --> 31:40.756
comprised of NTSB, Secret
Service, FBI and Air Force.

31:40.824 --> 31:42.624
Of course.

31:53.837 --> 31:58.640
The nation of France grieves
tonight, with all Americans.

31:58.708 --> 31:59.641
Thank you.

32:02.545 --> 32:03.579
Madam Secretary.

32:03.646 --> 32:04.646
Barry.

32:05.615 --> 32:06.982
I'm glad you're safe.

32:07.050 --> 32:09.017
Most trips, one or both of us
would've been on that plane.

32:09.085 --> 32:10.552
Look, uh,

32:10.620 --> 32:13.455
we've been at each other's
throats for quite some time,

32:13.523 --> 32:16.024
but right now, Elaine, the fact
that you are still in office

32:16.092 --> 32:18.527
is the only bright
spot in my day.

32:18.595 --> 32:21.997
Collier's asked the Chief
Justice to administer the oath.

32:22.065 --> 32:23.565
He's not invoking Section Four?

32:23.633 --> 32:24.733
I tried.

32:24.801 --> 32:26.235
White House counsel
even wrote the letter.

32:26.302 --> 32:27.569
Section Four?

32:27.637 --> 32:28.737
Of the 25th Amendment.

32:28.805 --> 32:30.472
It allows for the powers
of the presidency

32:30.540 --> 32:33.208
to reside temporarily
with the vice president.

32:33.276 --> 32:35.110
It's the only proper
course of action

32:35.178 --> 32:36.512
because we haven't found
Garcetti's body.

32:36.579 --> 32:37.713
I have no standing

32:37.780 --> 32:39.581
vis-à-vis the 25th Amendment,
but you do.

32:39.649 --> 32:40.916
You're the senior
cabinet official.

32:40.984 --> 32:42.084
Alice.

32:42.152 --> 32:44.286
Can I have the letter?

32:44.354 --> 32:46.421
Circulate this
to the cabinet secretaries.

32:46.489 --> 32:47.823
Make sure they sign it.

32:47.891 --> 32:48.991
Highest priority.

32:49.058 --> 32:50.959
If they have questions,
they can call me.

32:51.027 --> 32:52.261
I'm going to the Oval.

32:52.328 --> 32:54.263
Officials have not
entirely ruled out

32:54.330 --> 32:57.032
this being an act of terrorism,
but experts tell us...

32:57.100 --> 32:59.034
All right, give this
to Frank, but move the quote

32:59.102 --> 33:01.103
from the Boeing spokeswoman up.

33:03.306 --> 33:04.873
Hey, how's it going?
I got a first-person account

33:04.941 --> 33:06.375
from an air traffic controller
at Biarritz Parme.

33:06.442 --> 33:07.709
I'm almost done.
Okay.

33:07.777 --> 33:08.911
I got to pop upstairs.

33:08.978 --> 33:11.079
I think Seavers wants
to expand the edition.

33:11.147 --> 33:12.514
Get me 600 more words
if you can.

33:12.582 --> 33:13.849
Okay.

33:13.917 --> 33:15.083
Hey, Alex.

33:16.519 --> 33:19.021
Can you believe
this is happening?

33:19.088 --> 33:21.723
It's so sad...

33:21.791 --> 33:23.592
and scary.

33:23.660 --> 33:26.595
It'll be okay.

33:26.663 --> 33:28.197
You have a call on one.

33:28.264 --> 33:29.631
Something's happening
at the Oval Office.

33:31.668 --> 33:33.068
Susan Berg.

33:33.136 --> 33:35.637
Are you sure you can't
see anything at all?

33:38.708 --> 33:41.276
Elaine.

33:41.344 --> 33:44.413
I'm glad you're here, in spite
of all our differences.

33:44.480 --> 33:45.480
We need to talk.

33:45.548 --> 33:46.848
Chief Justice.

33:48.885 --> 33:51.119
Thank you so much for coming.

33:51.187 --> 33:53.956
Means the world to me to know
that you'll be the one

33:54.023 --> 33:55.958
who will administer my oath.

33:56.025 --> 33:56.858
Fred.

34:02.865 --> 34:04.800
You can't do this yet.

34:04.867 --> 34:06.935
They haven't found the body.

34:07.003 --> 34:09.471
Nation needs to know
there is someone in charge.

34:09.539 --> 34:10.938
You are, Fred.

34:11.007 --> 34:13.742
But if you take this oath and
Paul Garcetti turns up alive,

34:13.810 --> 34:15.710
we'll have two presidents.

34:15.777 --> 34:18.746
And that presents a slight
Constitutional problem.

34:18.815 --> 34:21.016
I've spoken to counsel.

34:21.083 --> 34:24.553
I am fully within the bounds
of the Constitution.

34:26.556 --> 34:28.489
You don't want questions

34:28.558 --> 34:31.726
lingering over your presidency,
believe me.

34:37.766 --> 34:39.268
Oath's a bit premature.

34:39.335 --> 34:44.273
The proper course is for me
to temporarily assume power

34:44.340 --> 34:45.974
by writing a letter
to Congress,

34:46.042 --> 34:48.176
along with a majority
of my cabinet.

34:48.244 --> 34:49.311
We took the liberty.

34:49.379 --> 34:51.079
The cabinet is unanimous.

34:51.147 --> 34:52.681
We all signed.
Hmm.

34:54.717 --> 34:56.251
Of course you did.

35:09.332 --> 35:14.102
Elaine, I'd like you to stay
on in your post for a while.

35:14.170 --> 35:17.973
I think the nation
wants to see unity.

35:18.041 --> 35:20.275
Yes, sir.

35:20.343 --> 35:23.312
Speaker of the House
confirms receipt,

35:23.379 --> 35:27.382
and also Senate
Pro-Tem confirms.

35:27.450 --> 35:28.950
That it?

35:29.018 --> 35:30.585
That's it.

35:30.653 --> 35:34.556
You're now the Acting President
of the United States.

35:34.624 --> 35:36.358
Congratulations, sir.

35:41.130 --> 35:42.731
All right.

35:42.799 --> 35:44.866
Thanks, everyone.

35:47.537 --> 35:50.806
Barry, alert the majors.

35:50.873 --> 35:53.742
I'll be giving my address
to the nation in 20 minutes.

35:53.810 --> 35:54.743
Right after that,

35:54.811 --> 35:56.144
I want the Joint Chiefs in here.

35:56.212 --> 35:57.145
Got it?

35:57.213 --> 35:58.847
Got it. Yes, sir.

35:58.915 --> 36:01.116
Thank you, Elaine.

36:11.761 --> 36:13.795
Hey. Hey, hey.

36:13.863 --> 36:17.366
It's been 45 minutes; I need to
know if I'm getting extra space.

36:17.433 --> 36:18.533
Where are you going?

36:18.601 --> 36:20.068
Walk with me to the elevators.

36:20.136 --> 36:23.004
Georgia went to Seavers.

36:23.072 --> 36:24.706
Told him I killed
her Barrish piece.

36:24.774 --> 36:25.707
Today?

36:25.775 --> 36:27.342
She didn't.

36:27.410 --> 36:29.378
She said, um, I've been having

36:29.445 --> 36:31.213
an inappropriate sexual
relationship with her.

36:31.280 --> 36:35.217
That to cover it
up, I've been...

36:35.284 --> 36:38.453
denying her professional
opportunities.

36:38.521 --> 36:39.788
I've been suspended
indefinitely.

36:39.856 --> 36:41.790
Okay, I'll find Seavers.

36:41.858 --> 36:44.726
I'll tell him I was the one who
compromised the Barrish story

36:44.794 --> 36:46.561
due to
my sexual inappropriateness.

36:46.629 --> 36:48.263
No.

36:48.331 --> 36:50.499
There's en enough
awfulness for one day.

36:50.566 --> 36:52.067
He does not need to know that.

36:52.135 --> 36:53.268
He wouldn't suspend you...

36:53.336 --> 36:54.636
Susan, I told you,

36:54.704 --> 36:56.705
the paper would not survive
that kind of scandal.

36:58.741 --> 37:01.176
You weren't protecting the
paper, you were protecting me.

37:06.082 --> 37:07.716
None of this would have happened

37:07.784 --> 37:09.785
if I hadn't slept with Georgia
in the first place.

37:09.852 --> 37:11.520
Alex...
I just need to go home.

37:11.587 --> 37:13.622
Okay?
Call me sometime.

37:16.125 --> 37:18.059
We'll get a drink.

37:18.127 --> 37:20.128
<i>...their search for survivors</i>

37:20.196 --> 37:21.563
of the Air Force One tragedy...

37:21.631 --> 37:22.664
Yeah.

37:22.732 --> 37:26.067
Yeah, I'll make
a statement tomorrow, Vin.

37:26.135 --> 37:29.137
All right? Now, tonight
I just want you to print

37:29.205 --> 37:31.373
what all the history books
will say,

37:31.441 --> 37:33.875
that we lost a great American

37:33.943 --> 37:36.778
and one of the best presidents
this nation has ever seen.

37:36.846 --> 37:38.280
Bye.

37:38.347 --> 37:41.716
Yesterday, he was a greasy
bastard, today he's a saint.

37:41.784 --> 37:46.087
That son of a bitch
Reppel from the <i>Times</i>

37:46.155 --> 37:48.089
was trying to quote me back

37:48.157 --> 37:51.993
some tasteless joke he thinks
I made about Garcetti.

37:52.061 --> 37:54.596
It's an absolutely
haunting image.

37:54.664 --> 37:57.833
We are now hearing reports that
several more bodies have been

37:57.900 --> 37:59.968
found nearby
that have not been identified.

38:00.036 --> 38:01.970
Hey, sugar,
what's happening there?

38:02.038 --> 38:03.238
The Ogamis called.

38:03.306 --> 38:04.806
Anne phoned them from the road.

38:04.874 --> 38:06.575
From the road?

38:06.642 --> 38:08.443
Apparently, Douglas and Anne
have eloped.

38:08.511 --> 38:09.845
They've eloped? Where to?
Who?

38:09.912 --> 38:10.779
Across the country?

38:10.847 --> 38:11.880
Around the corner?

38:11.948 --> 38:13.081
I have no idea.

38:13.149 --> 38:15.116
That's why
they call it eloping, Bud.

38:15.184 --> 38:16.751
Yeah, well, you got enough
on your plate, Elaine.

38:16.819 --> 38:18.920
You just leave this with us;
we'll see what we can do.

38:18.988 --> 38:20.856
I'm coming home.

38:20.923 --> 38:22.123
All right, bye.

38:22.191 --> 38:23.458
Where'd they elope to?

38:23.526 --> 38:24.392
I don't know.

38:27.263 --> 38:29.030
I think I do.

38:30.900 --> 38:34.002
Forward anything that
needs my signoff.

38:34.070 --> 38:36.238
And, uh, otherwise,
just have Bill

38:36.305 --> 38:38.907
or one of the undersecretaries.

38:38.975 --> 38:40.509
Madam Secretary.

38:43.546 --> 38:45.847
It's okay.

38:47.650 --> 38:51.419
I didn't think
today would end like this.

38:51.487 --> 38:56.224
Oh, it's been a pretty
shocking day all around.

38:57.260 --> 38:59.160
I killed the story.

38:59.228 --> 39:01.096
Thank you.

39:01.163 --> 39:02.297
How?

39:02.365 --> 39:03.598
Mm...

39:03.666 --> 39:07.002
A lot of stories will be
put on hold for a while.

39:07.069 --> 39:08.470
And my boss helped.

39:08.538 --> 39:09.638
Your ex?
Yeah.

39:09.705 --> 39:11.072
The asshole who cheated on me

39:11.140 --> 39:13.975
turned out not to be
such a total asshole.

39:14.043 --> 39:18.146
No one is as horrible as
we imagine them to be.

39:18.214 --> 39:22.050
Two weeks ago, I wanted
to crush Garcetti.

39:22.118 --> 39:24.986
Today, I wanted
to run with him.

39:25.054 --> 39:26.555
And tonight...

39:29.825 --> 39:33.762
Sorry, I haven't had time
to process any of this.

39:38.401 --> 39:40.001
I'm, uh...

39:40.069 --> 39:43.538
going home to be
with my family.

39:44.540 --> 39:47.409
Uh, Douglas has...

39:47.476 --> 39:50.812
chosen this occasion to elope.

39:50.880 --> 39:52.547
Douglas and Anne eloped?

39:52.615 --> 39:54.749
Yeah.

39:56.419 --> 39:59.654
You must have developed
quite a bond with him

39:59.722 --> 40:01.556
these last few weeks.

40:01.624 --> 40:03.258
Yes.

40:03.326 --> 40:05.594
A professional one.

40:05.661 --> 40:09.030
Please extend my congratulations
to both of them.

40:10.066 --> 40:12.067
I will.

40:19.408 --> 40:22.677
Tomorrow night I'm gonna
fly to France,

40:22.745 --> 40:26.581
to assist however I can.

40:28.050 --> 40:32.187
Um... if you're not
sick of the plane...

40:34.857 --> 40:36.224
you're welcome to join me.

40:38.260 --> 40:39.861
I'm there.

40:39.929 --> 40:41.930
Good.

40:45.201 --> 40:46.835
I'll put you on the manifest.

41:09.031 --> 41:11.766
Anne... Douglas...

41:11.833 --> 41:15.803
I'd like to begin
with a prayer of thanks.

41:15.871 --> 41:19.140
Heavenly Father, we thank you
for bringing this young couple

41:19.208 --> 41:24.045
here today to remind us that
even in a time of darkness,

41:24.112 --> 41:26.414
love can lift us up

41:26.481 --> 41:28.149
to the light.

41:28.217 --> 41:29.750
Bless this young man, Douglas,

41:29.818 --> 41:33.654
who I baptized as a baby
some 30 years ago...

41:35.457 --> 41:36.591
Oh, no.

41:40.195 --> 41:42.263
I'm so sorry.

41:42.331 --> 41:44.699
No, we've got to get out.

41:44.766 --> 41:46.300
Get the...

41:46.368 --> 41:48.369
There we go.

41:49.471 --> 41:51.305
T.J., hey.

41:51.373 --> 41:53.007
How the hell did everybody
know we were here?

41:53.075 --> 41:55.343
"Grandpa Hammond's farm.

41:55.410 --> 41:56.744
The best place on Earth."

41:56.812 --> 41:59.247
I thought it'd be a good idea
for all of us to be together.

41:59.314 --> 42:00.381
I just didn't realize

42:00.449 --> 42:01.649
the Imperial Storm
Troopers were coming.

42:01.717 --> 42:03.317
All right, sweetheart!
Hi.

42:03.385 --> 42:06.354
Well, thanks for the invite,
you little shit.

42:10.025 --> 42:11.859
Take messages from everybody.

42:11.927 --> 42:14.195
Including the Acting President.

42:14.263 --> 42:15.429
Thank you.

42:16.865 --> 42:18.499
Sweetheart,

42:18.567 --> 42:20.268
I know this is
a huge intrusion.

42:20.335 --> 42:21.269
You think?

42:21.336 --> 42:22.670
I just couldn't let you

42:22.738 --> 42:24.438
run off and get
married like this.

42:24.506 --> 42:26.107
After everything
that's happened, I...

42:26.174 --> 42:27.775
I'm so sorry.
Mom...

42:27.843 --> 42:29.844
You mean more to me
than I can say.

42:31.880 --> 42:34.115
I don't even know if
I can explain why, okay?

42:34.182 --> 42:36.684
I just needed...
clarity.

42:36.752 --> 42:38.886
I'm just so happy to see you.

42:38.954 --> 42:40.354
I'm so glad you're here.

42:40.422 --> 42:41.522
Really?

42:41.590 --> 42:43.124
Yeah.
Do you think Anne will be glad?

42:43.191 --> 42:44.792
We'll find out.

42:44.860 --> 42:48.029
Anne...

42:48.096 --> 42:49.563
Are you okay with all
of us being here?

42:49.631 --> 42:51.098
Please be honest.

42:51.166 --> 42:53.334
People don't normally crash
other people's elopements.

42:53.402 --> 42:56.604
But this is not a normal time,

42:56.672 --> 42:59.540
and this is not
a normal family.

42:59.608 --> 43:01.509
All right!
Let's get this show on the road.

43:01.576 --> 43:04.578
Now, we got beer, champagne
and five pounds of shrimp

43:04.646 --> 43:06.147
ready to go.

43:06.214 --> 43:07.748
Yes, and we also brought sake.

43:07.816 --> 43:10.484
In case you want to do
the Shinto wedding tradition

43:10.552 --> 43:11.552
of San San Kudo.

43:11.620 --> 43:13.387
Mom, all this Japanese stuff

43:13.455 --> 43:17.224
that you keep throwing
on Anne... it's racist.

43:17.292 --> 43:20.561
Oh, I thought I was being
multi-culturally sensitive.

43:20.629 --> 43:23.731
Well... good thing I didn't
bring my kimono. Mom...

43:23.799 --> 43:26.267
The Reverend agrees
that as ex-President

43:26.335 --> 43:28.569
I can perform
the marriage ceremony.

43:28.637 --> 43:30.604
Assuming that's okay
with you two lovebirds.

43:30.672 --> 43:33.407
Do we have a choice?
You do not.

43:33.475 --> 43:36.711
Now, this reminds me of
a passage from Isaiah.

43:36.778 --> 43:39.213
"For you shall go out with joy,

43:39.281 --> 43:42.550
"and be led forth with peace:

43:42.617 --> 43:44.919
"the mountains and
the hills shall

43:44.986 --> 43:47.021
"break forth before
you into singing,

43:47.089 --> 43:51.125
and all the trees of the field
shall clap their hands."

44:49.918 --> 44:52.453
How you doing, darlin'?

44:52.521 --> 44:54.522
I'm just, um...

44:56.191 --> 44:58.459
...putting one foot
in front of the other.

45:00.495 --> 45:03.197
I made a lot of plans
sitting on this wall,

45:03.265 --> 45:05.466
including running
for President.

45:05.534 --> 45:07.134
I think I was about nine.

45:07.202 --> 45:09.136
Maybe ten.

45:09.204 --> 45:10.137
And right over there,

45:10.205 --> 45:13.507
is where I asked you
to marry me.

45:13.575 --> 45:14.708
And I said "no."

45:14.776 --> 45:16.977
Only twice.
Three times.

45:17.045 --> 45:18.946
Wasn't twice?
Nope.

45:19.014 --> 45:21.348
You said "yes" eventually.

45:21.416 --> 45:23.951
You wore me down.

45:24.019 --> 45:27.555
I loved you with my
entire heart, sugar.

45:27.622 --> 45:30.124
I always did.

45:30.192 --> 45:32.693
You were a little freer
with your other organs.

45:41.870 --> 45:43.938
It's a shame.

45:44.005 --> 45:46.841
About the deal you made
to be Garcetti's Veep.

45:46.908 --> 45:49.910
You would have finally
been on the winning ticket.

45:55.484 --> 45:59.053
We can't let Fred Collier
stay President.

45:59.120 --> 46:01.055
He represents the worst
of the Democratic Party.

46:01.122 --> 46:02.990
President Howdy Doody.

46:03.058 --> 46:04.959
Now, sure, his
numbers will spike

46:05.026 --> 46:06.227
with all the goodwill
following this.

46:06.294 --> 46:08.329
But he will squander it, right?

46:08.396 --> 46:10.498
Like the dumb,
shit-eating turtle his.

46:10.565 --> 46:13.734
Bud, the President just died.

46:13.802 --> 46:15.836
Our son just got married.

46:15.904 --> 46:18.205
Can you stop talking
about politics

46:18.273 --> 46:19.540
for one frigging minute?

46:19.608 --> 46:22.243
This is the most
profound crisis

46:22.310 --> 46:24.845
most Americans will
experience in their lifetime.

46:24.913 --> 46:26.180
Now, they need a strong,

46:26.248 --> 46:29.049
resilient, competent leader

46:29.117 --> 46:30.484
to get them through this.

46:30.552 --> 46:33.120
Fred Collier is not that man.

46:33.188 --> 46:36.190
But you are that woman.

46:37.692 --> 46:39.693
And you know it.

46:41.530 --> 46:42.963
Come on, Elaine, this is me.

46:43.031 --> 46:45.032
No one else.

46:47.502 --> 46:49.570
Now, you tell me you're gonna
do something about this.

46:51.606 --> 46:53.274
Just say it.

46:53.341 --> 46:54.542
Say the words.

46:58.113 --> 47:00.114
Say you're gonna run.

47:13.222 --> 47:20.400
