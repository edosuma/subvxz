WEBVTT

00:07.882 --> 00:10.593
You watch. You fucking watch.
It'll happen again.

00:10.677 --> 00:12.762
You'll break up with me.
Then you'll change your mind

00:12.846 --> 00:14.180
and you'll come running back.

00:14.264 --> 00:17.684
So, let's just skip that part
and stay together.

00:17.767 --> 00:19.936
I'm sorry. I know that
that was very hurtful,

00:20.020 --> 00:22.731
and I'm never gonna do that
to you ever again.

00:22.814 --> 00:25.400
You don't have to be so sure about it.
That's not what I'm saying.

00:25.483 --> 00:26.860
I'm trying to say that we should--

00:26.943 --> 00:30.321
Randy, I wanna do this
in the kindest way possible

00:30.405 --> 00:35.160
because you are a very special person,
and I wouldn't wanna lose you as a friend.

00:35.827 --> 00:37.370
So we'll still be friends?

00:38.872 --> 00:39.706
Sure.

00:40.290 --> 00:42.125
That's all I needed to hear, Bertie Bear.

00:43.877 --> 00:46.004
And then maybe after some time passes,

00:46.588 --> 00:50.675
we'll realize that
maybe we do belong together.

00:51.801 --> 00:55.346
-I don't think so.
-Oh! Well, fuck off then!

00:55.430 --> 00:58.266
I just don't want things to be weird
when we run into each other.

00:58.349 --> 01:02.228
Oh, well guess what. It will be weird.
It will be weird as fuck!

01:05.774 --> 01:07.400
And I just wanna ask you

01:07.484 --> 01:10.528
if I can please tell people
that this was a mutual breakup.

01:10.612 --> 01:12.572
You can tell people you broke up
with me if you want.

01:12.655 --> 01:13.698
I'll go along with it.

01:13.782 --> 01:15.742
No, it's gotta be mutual.

01:15.825 --> 01:16.868
Okay, it's mutual.

01:16.951 --> 01:18.912
I'm slamming the f-- door.

01:18.995 --> 01:20.038
Okay.

01:49.484 --> 01:52.695
Do you think I should hold the broom,
like, sexy, or...

01:52.779 --> 01:55.031
Oh, God, every single photo shoot,
someone's like, "Ooh, you know what?
Maybe she'll hold a broom."

01:57.450 --> 01:59.244
As if they're the first
to ever think of that.

01:59.327 --> 02:02.872
Remember, you're witches.
Grab the broom and lean back.

02:03.706 --> 02:05.458
Hey.
Yeah?

02:05.542 --> 02:07.210
Can you get some of just her by herself?

02:07.293 --> 02:09.087
-Yeah, no problem.
-Thank you.

02:10.588 --> 02:13.508
Obvious phallic symbol.
It's in the goddamn Wiccan!

02:14.843 --> 02:16.678
-Cruikshank. Hey.
-Hey.

02:16.761 --> 02:19.097
Uh... What were you thinking?

02:19.806 --> 02:20.807
What do you mean?

02:20.890 --> 02:22.642
Putting Arya in your movie.

02:23.643 --> 02:25.228
Oh!

02:25.311 --> 02:27.438
-Look, I'm sorry. I just...
-Mm-hmm.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.274
I thought that was one of those, you know,

02:29.357 --> 02:32.694
don't ask permission,
beg for forgiveness kind of things.

02:32.777 --> 02:34.821
-Well, uh, I got curious...
-Uh-huh.

02:34.904 --> 02:37.699
...so I made Wyatt get a copy
of your script,

02:37.782 --> 02:39.868
so we could read it
and make fun of it.

02:39.951 --> 02:41.911
Mm-hmm. Okay, thanks.

02:41.995 --> 02:45.456
Yeah. So we read it, and, uh, it was good.

02:46.499 --> 02:49.377
I'm not saying it was great.
I'm not, 'cause it wasn't, okay?

02:49.460 --> 02:53.423
But, uh, there was some real talent there.

02:54.257 --> 02:56.759
Well, that's nice to hear.

02:56.843 --> 02:59.470
I mean, it's funny,
'cause when I first came up with the idea, I was like,
"Ooh, this is one of those ideas."

03:02.265 --> 03:04.183
Stop talking.
You're saying too many words.

03:04.267 --> 03:05.226
-Okay.

03:05.310 --> 03:09.689
So, um, the network has asked me
to create a new show,

03:09.772 --> 03:11.983
so I am developing a pilot now.

03:12.066 --> 03:16.362
It's a political thriller
that takes place on a space colony.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.114
-Very cool, very cool.
-Yeah.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.783
And I'm putting together a staff
of writers now to help me

03:20.867 --> 03:23.828
and when the show gets picked up,
they'll be the staff.

03:23.912 --> 03:26.623
-Huh.
-I think you're right for the job.

03:28.124 --> 03:30.084
Really?
-No shit. Yeah.

03:30.168 --> 03:31.711
You know, there's all this sci-fi stuff,

03:31.794 --> 03:34.631
and I'm just gonna, you know,
take a big leap here

03:34.714 --> 03:36.674
and guess you have some familiarity
with that?

03:36.758 --> 03:40.261
Susan, just 'cause I have glasses
and I dress a certain way

03:40.345 --> 03:41.971
doesn't mean I'm into science fiction,

03:42.055 --> 03:45.642
but of course I'm
into science fiction, yes!

03:45.725 --> 03:47.143
So, do you want the job?

03:47.227 --> 03:51.481
Yes, please. Oh, my God.
A thousand times yes, yes, yes.

03:51.564 --> 03:53.233
And you're gonna behave yourself
this time?

03:53.316 --> 03:54.609
-Definitely.
-None of this, like,

03:54.692 --> 03:57.695
throwing laptops around
the fucking writers' room bullshit?

03:57.779 --> 03:59.614
Those laptop throwing days
are behind me.

03:59.697 --> 04:01.950
-I promise, yes.

04:02.033 --> 04:02.867
Okay.

04:02.951 --> 04:06.079
Thank you, Susan.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

04:07.288 --> 04:09.958
Sorry I hugged you there. Was that wrong?

04:10.708 --> 04:12.919
No, it was appropriate.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.390
Oh, Gus, come on in! -Hi.

04:29.602 --> 04:32.230
I don't know.
I just thought I'd come in and say hello,

04:32.313 --> 04:35.566
see how you were doing.
You maybe, uh, wanna go get some lunch?

04:36.192 --> 04:37.235
It's 10:00 a.m.

04:38.736 --> 04:41.406
-Yeah, that's so sweet.

04:41.489 --> 04:42.490
I have to finish this.

04:42.573 --> 04:45.076
Oh, sure, yeah. No, don't let me stop you.

04:45.159 --> 04:46.077
Do what you have to do.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.538
Wait! Is this Gus Cruikshank, boy legend?

04:48.621 --> 04:52.458
Is this Stella Emmett,
whose show I love so much,

04:52.542 --> 04:54.711
even though it makes me feel
very weird sometimes?

04:54.794 --> 04:56.921
-Well, then I'm doing my job.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.965
Yay! You two meet, finally.

04:59.048 --> 05:01.509
Mickey talks about you so much,
I feel like I already know you.

05:01.592 --> 05:02.719
Aw...

05:02.802 --> 05:04.679
I'm sure it's all good things, yes?

05:04.762 --> 05:06.514
Duh. Stella, how many times have I said,

05:06.597 --> 05:09.392
"Sometimes I just think
Gus' penis is too big"?

05:09.475 --> 05:11.227
Like, every day since I met you.

05:13.271 --> 05:15.940
Well, now you know.
My penis must be fairly big

05:16.024 --> 05:18.735
because, otherwise, that would be
a rude thing to...

05:18.818 --> 05:20.320
Or at least average.

05:20.862 --> 05:23.823
Never mind. I'm gonna shut up.
Just

05:23.906 --> 05:26.117
-Yeah, just stop talking. Yeah.
-Okay.

05:29.537 --> 05:30.788
Oh, my God. Are you serious?

05:30.872 --> 05:32.874
Yeah, we start writing next month.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.668
-Sweetie, congratulations.
-Oh, thank you.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.545
I mean, thank you for everything.

05:37.628 --> 05:40.840
I mean, I couldn't...
I couldn't have done this without you.

05:40.923 --> 05:43.217
Thank you, too. You know?

05:43.301 --> 05:46.054
I never gave a shit about work
before I met you.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.473
You really bring out the best in me.

05:49.015 --> 05:50.933
Yeah, you bring out the best in me, too.

05:51.559 --> 05:52.935
Taught me how to kick ass.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.854
You taught me how to kiss it.

05:54.937 --> 05:58.066
Look at us,
killing it in every aspect of our life.

05:58.149 --> 06:01.235
I feel like the universe is rewarding us
for getting our shit together.

06:02.153 --> 06:04.363
You know, I actually think that's,
like, true.

06:04.447 --> 06:05.531
This might sound weird,

06:05.615 --> 06:07.700
but I feel like in South Dakota,
we cracked the code,

06:07.784 --> 06:09.535
like, the code to our relationship.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.537
Yes, exactly.

06:11.621 --> 06:14.916
The code. I know what you mean.
We know the code exactly, yeah.

06:14.999 --> 06:17.835
As long as we're open with each other
and we're real with each other,

06:17.919 --> 06:19.045
we're gonna be okay.

06:19.128 --> 06:20.797
All we have to do... It's so easy.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.382
We just go like,
"Hey, I feel this way inside.

06:23.466 --> 06:24.675
-I'm gonna tell Mickey."
-Yeah.

06:24.759 --> 06:25.927
You feel something. You tell me.

06:26.010 --> 06:29.514
And we're there for each other,
and we can work through anything.

06:29.597 --> 06:33.726
Yeah. It's so sad how, like, other couples
and other people in relationships,

06:33.810 --> 06:35.019
they feel like they can't, like,

06:35.103 --> 06:36.062
share who they are.

06:36.145 --> 06:38.397
And I just know, like, you're not gonna
think I'm lame.

06:38.481 --> 06:39.357
No.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.150
I don't even know
what we would fight about.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.485
-I would try to think,

06:42.568 --> 06:44.779
I'd go like,
"What couldn't we work through?"

06:44.862 --> 06:47.657
And it's like nothing.
We could work through anything.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.325
I know that's gonna be true in a year.

06:49.408 --> 06:52.161
-Mm-hmm.
-In, like, five years. In 40 years.

06:52.245 --> 06:56.749
Exactly, and I'm like, "If I know
I'm gonna feel this 40 years from now,

06:56.833 --> 07:00.545
why wouldn't I just...
And why wouldn't we just..."

07:02.630 --> 07:04.215
What? Come on, say it.

07:04.298 --> 07:05.133
No, no, no.

07:05.216 --> 07:07.593
Come on.
-I gotta keep my mouth shut about this.

07:08.052 --> 07:10.221
-Say it. Say it.
-You don't wanna hear it.

07:13.349 --> 07:17.645
I know I've already proposed once before
in my life,

07:18.062 --> 07:19.981
but if I was gonna propose to you, I...

07:21.566 --> 07:23.985
I'd want you to know I meant it for real.

07:24.068 --> 07:27.363
Okay? I'd want it to happen right away.

07:27.447 --> 07:31.826
What do you mean right away?
Like, run off and elope?

07:33.953 --> 07:35.121
Maybe.

07:40.084 --> 07:41.711
Gah! Oh, my God!

07:41.794 --> 07:43.504
Aren't you freaking out?

07:43.588 --> 07:45.715
I mean, it's exciting, right?

07:45.798 --> 07:47.967
This is... Wow!

07:48.050 --> 07:52.430
Wait, where is this happening?
How What the fuck?

07:52.513 --> 07:55.641
We're going to Catalina Island
and having a quickie wedding on the beach.

07:55.725 --> 07:58.144
The beach. Beautiful.

07:58.227 --> 08:00.146
You can get a justice of the peace
the same day.

08:00.229 --> 08:01.606
We talked to her
on the way over here.

08:01.689 --> 08:03.816
Yeah. Her name's Terry.
She seems really nice.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.818
-Terry. Perfect.
Yep.

08:05.902 --> 08:09.822
She's gonna meet us on the beach near
our hotel around six-ish and marry us.

08:09.906 --> 08:12.366
-She's licensed and everything.
-Wow.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.535
Catalina. What a beautiful place.

08:14.619 --> 08:15.453
Have you been there?

08:15.536 --> 08:18.164
Never, but when people talk
about Catalina, I always think, "That sounds very nice.
And I'd like to go there some day."

08:22.251 --> 08:24.295
Do you wanna come with us?
'Cause we need a witness.

08:24.378 --> 08:27.548
Yeah, Terry was gonna, like,
provide somebody for us, but...

08:27.632 --> 08:29.967
You're way better
than some weirdo stranger.

08:30.051 --> 08:31.886
Bertie, do you wanna be our witness?

08:31.969 --> 08:35.765
That would be incredible.
Me How humbling.

08:35.848 --> 08:38.267
Is it warm there?
Should I pack my swimmers?

08:38.351 --> 08:39.268
I'm gonna pack 'em anyway.

08:39.352 --> 08:42.772
This is very exciting!

08:44.023 --> 08:47.026
Do you wanna tell anybody else?
You wanna call our parents or...

08:47.109 --> 08:48.694
Is it okay if we don't?

08:48.778 --> 08:51.989
It's just, with my dad,
it'll be this whole big thing and my mom, uh, she won't be into it.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.495
But I thought you and your mom
got along, right?

08:57.578 --> 08:59.330
Oh, we do. Yeah, she's the best.

08:59.413 --> 09:02.917
I just don't want her to bum me out
with her reasonable thoughts.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.461
Right, right, right, right, right.

09:07.088 --> 09:10.841
You think she's got a point,
or you think this is impulsive? Or...

09:10.925 --> 09:12.468
She'd say I'm being impulsive,

09:12.552 --> 09:16.597
but maybe being impulsive
is just me following my instincts.

09:17.598 --> 09:19.934
I wanna listen to my inner voice
and act fast before the little damaged voices
talk me out of it.

09:25.856 --> 09:29.110
Hey, Gus, would you maybe
wanna bring a buddy along?

09:29.193 --> 09:32.613
Oh, that could be fun!
Like a maid of honor, best man-type thing.

09:32.697 --> 09:36.033
Yeah, sure, that's good.
I guess I'll ask Randy.

09:36.117 --> 09:38.828
No. Don't. Um...

09:39.287 --> 09:40.371
We broke up.

09:40.454 --> 09:42.039
-Whoa!

09:42.123 --> 09:45.001
It was mutual,
or that's what I'm supposed to say.

09:45.084 --> 09:46.294
Aw, that's...

09:47.753 --> 09:48.713
too bad.

09:48.796 --> 09:51.173
It was for the best, obviously.

09:51.924 --> 09:54.468
Uh, I guess, then, um...
I'll ask Chris?

09:54.552 --> 09:56.762
Great. I...

09:58.222 --> 10:01.726
Okay. Uh, well, I should probably give you
a little heads-up on that,

10:01.809 --> 10:04.061
and that is Chris and I are...

10:04.979 --> 10:07.315
Well, something's happening between us.

10:07.398 --> 10:08.482
Really?

10:09.066 --> 10:10.192
Wow. Okay.

10:11.944 --> 10:15.448
Yeah. I mean, we have a very special
connection, and we always have,

10:15.531 --> 10:19.327
so once Randy and I had split up,
that's when we took the next step.

10:19.410 --> 10:22.622
But nothing happened before that,
or whatever.

10:22.705 --> 10:26.292
Yeah, I'm psyched for you two.
That's awesome. Uh...

10:26.375 --> 10:27.501
What a weird day.

10:27.585 --> 10:31.505
-What a big, weird day this is. Yeah.
-It's so weird. Yeah.

10:31.631 --> 10:34.884
Well, why do we have to stop there?
We just invite everyone.

10:34.967 --> 10:38.304
Send out a mass group text
and see who shows up.

10:38.387 --> 10:41.682
Right. I mean, we're eloping.
We can do whatever the fuck we want.

10:41.766 --> 10:44.393
-That's the whole point.
-Yeah, all right.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.437
Let's just get married the way we want to.

10:46.520 --> 10:48.356
If people come, that's great.
If they don't--

10:48.439 --> 10:50.107
-They're dead to us forever.

10:50.191 --> 10:54.028
"Psst! Gus and Mickey eloping."

10:54.111 --> 10:55.363
I'm transcribing this.

10:55.446 --> 10:57.365
-"If you wanna come to Catalina...
-Mm-hmm.

10:57.448 --> 10:58.949
-...join us."
-Yes.

10:59.033 --> 11:00.910
-"No one's invited."
-Yeah.

11:00.993 --> 11:02.078
"No one's not invited."

11:29.563 --> 11:32.566
<i>♪ I was born a unicorn ♪</i>

11:32.650 --> 11:36.487
<i>♪ I missed the ark, but I could've sworn ♪</i>

11:36.570 --> 11:41.826
<i>♪ You'd wait for me ♪</i>

11:42.576 --> 11:45.538
<i>♪ I was born a unicorn ♪</i>

11:45.621 --> 11:48.749
<i>♪ I could've sworn you believed in me ♪</i>

11:48.833 --> 11:54.672
<i>♪ Then how come all the other</i>
<i>Unicorns are dead? ♪</i>

11:54.755 --> 11:56.424
Oh, yeah.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.175
Oh, yeah.

11:58.259 --> 12:02.179
Oh, my God.

12:07.017 --> 12:08.227
Yes.

12:09.854 --> 12:10.938
Sorry, I'll keep it down.

12:11.021 --> 12:14.400
Oh, no, it's all good.
I'm so happy right now.

12:14.483 --> 12:17.903
Good, good. I'm very happy for you.

12:17.987 --> 12:20.906
And it's nice we get to do some cool shit
before everyone trickles in.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.491
Yeah, I love cool shit.

12:24.326 --> 12:26.745
Wow! What a whirlwind, right?

12:27.413 --> 12:29.623
You must be feeling, like, scared,

12:29.707 --> 12:33.085
or do you feel like
this is a bit fast maybe?

12:34.295 --> 12:36.422
Do you feel like it's a bit fast?

12:37.006 --> 12:41.886
Honestly? Yes.
Yeah, this feels a little fast.

12:43.053 --> 12:44.513
Just a little bit too fast.

12:44.597 --> 12:47.266
Like, if the speed limit was 65,
you'd be going...

12:47.349 --> 12:49.602
-70.
-Or 80.

12:49.685 --> 12:52.688
85. Hovering around 85, maybe.

12:52.771 --> 12:55.608
I don't know. I'm sorry. I just wanted
to check in to see if you're okay.

12:55.691 --> 12:59.236
No, I appreciate it.
I understand why you'd ask.

12:59.320 --> 13:03.115
I guess I just don't understand
how all this SLAA stuff works.

13:03.199 --> 13:08.662
I mean, yeah, it's not ideal,
but I think since we're both aware...

13:08.746 --> 13:10.080
Look at you and Chris.

13:10.164 --> 13:13.417
You know, if the speed limit is 65,
you're on, like, a rocket ship.

13:13.501 --> 13:16.420
I guess it's like
a chemical attraction thing.

13:16.504 --> 13:17.463
Mmm.

13:19.673 --> 13:21.258
Hey, so, uh, you nervous?

13:21.884 --> 13:24.345
Oh, yeah, I mean, big time.

13:24.428 --> 13:25.346
Yeah?

13:25.763 --> 13:27.348
About this or the wedding?

13:27.431 --> 13:30.935
-No, your wedding.
-Oh, my wedding! No! I feel great.

13:31.018 --> 13:32.186
-Yeah, so good.

13:32.269 --> 13:35.022
Dude, I'm so fucking psyched for you, man.
You have no idea.

13:35.105 --> 13:36.649
I'm psyched for me, too.

13:36.732 --> 13:42.988
I just got this feeling of excitement
and relief and happiness.

13:43.072 --> 13:45.824
Dude, those're the emotions you want, man.
That's the good shit.

13:45.908 --> 13:48.077
-Yeah. Yeah, that's...

13:48.160 --> 13:49.036
Hey, um...

13:50.371 --> 13:52.998
Bertie and I had sex, um,

13:53.582 --> 13:57.294
and it was while
her and Randy were still together.

13:57.378 --> 13:58.462
What?

13:58.546 --> 14:03.008
We're just, you know, in the spirit
of being open and honest, you know,

14:03.092 --> 14:05.302
I just-- it's kinda been weighing on me,

14:05.386 --> 14:08.430
and I kinda wanna just, like,
you know, put it out there.

14:08.514 --> 14:11.517
-It's kinda making me feel like shit.
-Oh, yeah, man. Don't worry. I'm...

14:11.600 --> 14:13.102
I'm not gonna judge you or anything.

14:16.146 --> 14:19.817
And we're just tapping
into all the world's love.

14:19.900 --> 14:23.070
Actually, also, in college,
I had sex with this girl

14:23.153 --> 14:26.407
who I later found out
I was, like, loosely related to. Um...

14:26.490 --> 14:29.994
Like, not first cousin or anything,
but, like, in the ancestry.

14:30.703 --> 14:34.290
-Oh, yeah, whatever. It's cool. Yeah.

14:36.417 --> 14:38.961
Whoo-hoo! Whoa!

14:48.178 --> 14:50.848
Okay! Here we go!

14:53.767 --> 14:55.227
So, you don't think it's too fast?

14:55.311 --> 14:58.606
-No, I think it's romantic.
-That's what I think.

14:58.689 --> 15:00.566
You really wanna know if it's right,

15:00.649 --> 15:02.693
my therapist had these three questions

15:02.776 --> 15:04.486
about whether you should get married
or not.

15:04.570 --> 15:07.823
Oh, three questions. What are they?
That's cool. It sounds like a fairy tale.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.742
-Okay, hit me.
-Okay.

15:09.825 --> 15:10.993
Number one:

15:11.452 --> 15:15.831
Do you have fun hanging out with him
when there's nothing else to do?

15:15.915 --> 15:17.875
100%.

15:17.958 --> 15:20.961
We're still finding things that we have
in common. It's great.

15:21.045 --> 15:23.714
Right. There's still quite a bit
of fighting though, right?

15:23.797 --> 15:27.551
Yeah, but I think that's a byproduct of
the passion that we have for each other.

15:27.635 --> 15:31.305
-Yeah, I get that. That makes sense.
-Yep. That's one perspective.

15:31.388 --> 15:33.599
Oh, my God.
This is fucking beautiful.

15:33.682 --> 15:35.100
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

15:35.184 --> 15:37.227
-Okay.

15:37.311 --> 15:39.313
Number two and this is a big one:

15:39.396 --> 15:40.689
Do you respect each other?

15:40.773 --> 15:44.151
Not just, like, holding the door open,
but deep respect.

15:44.234 --> 15:47.279
Oh, yeah, I mean, I respect him,

15:47.780 --> 15:50.866
and I don't think I would've been
his favorite person two years ago,

15:50.950 --> 15:52.743
but yes. Yeah.

15:54.119 --> 15:56.455
So, that's a yes with an asterisk.

15:56.538 --> 16:00.250
Okay, number three:
You don't have to answer this...

16:00.334 --> 16:01.752
Do you have a good sex life?

16:01.835 --> 16:06.006
Ha! Yeah, it's hard not to
less than a year in, so we'll see.

16:06.090 --> 16:08.842
You never know.
Jeff and I have been married for 12 years.

16:08.926 --> 16:10.844
He still goes down on me. Thank the Lord.

16:10.928 --> 16:12.096
That's awesome.

16:12.179 --> 16:14.723
Yes, that's a very exciting update
on Syd's marriage,

16:14.807 --> 16:18.435
but Mickey, like you said, it's very hard
to tell on the sex thing this early on.

16:18.519 --> 16:21.563
Yeah, but it's unreal,
so I think we're gonna be fine.

16:21.647 --> 16:23.732
There you go. That's it.
That's three yeses.

16:23.816 --> 16:26.527
-Yes.
-Mmm.

16:26.610 --> 16:29.405
Gus, I'm not saying don't do it.

16:29.488 --> 16:33.534
All I'm saying is that being a bachelor
is, like, the pinnacle of existence.

16:33.617 --> 16:35.661
You know, I just...
I think I'm one of those guys

16:35.744 --> 16:38.288
who's programmed to be
in a monogamous relationship.

16:38.372 --> 16:41.709
-I'm not gonna miss my single days.
-If you say so.

16:42.793 --> 16:46.171
I mean, this whole thing is a joke anyway,
right, Gus? It's a joke.

16:46.255 --> 16:48.215
There's no way you guys
are getting married this soon.

16:48.298 --> 16:50.050
No, we are. It's not a joke.

16:50.134 --> 16:53.429
No, no, not like a joke-joke,
but like a prank, like a fuck you,

16:53.512 --> 16:55.347
like a performance art piece
or something.

16:55.431 --> 16:57.599
Hey, Gus, imagine, you're single.

16:57.683 --> 17:00.811
You come home from work,
you take off your socks,

17:00.894 --> 17:02.312
throw 'em on the floor.

17:02.396 --> 17:05.482
You take a crap.
Maybe forget to flush the toilet.

17:05.566 --> 17:08.152
Toast a bagel.
Put a little butter on there.

17:08.986 --> 17:11.196
Freedom's nice.
I get what you're saying, but...

17:11.280 --> 17:14.199
Or maybe spread some cream cheese
on there. Do a bong hit.

17:14.283 --> 17:16.535
Put on a Willie Nelson album.
Why not? It's your life.

17:16.618 --> 17:19.288
You know, that might just be a trade-off
I'm willing to make.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.499
Plus, you guys don't know the alternative.

17:22.583 --> 17:25.586
Are you kidding me? We got five divorces
between the two of us.

17:25.669 --> 17:28.505
Loverboy's got two.
I got the hat trick.

17:28.589 --> 17:30.466
-Love is a battlefield.

17:30.549 --> 17:33.761
I really think it's funny, Gus.
Getting everyone on an island like this.

17:34.261 --> 17:35.554
I'm really beginning to see it.

17:37.473 --> 17:38.974
Not a prank, buddy.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.435
Not a prank.

17:57.618 --> 18:01.413
Wow! Mickey, you look...

18:02.414 --> 18:05.751
-I mean, you look beautiful.
Thank you.

18:05.834 --> 18:10.089
Inside and out.
You know, I like all of your sides, so...

18:10.756 --> 18:12.049
I love all your sides, too.

18:13.967 --> 18:15.677
-Stop looking at me. It's bad luck.

18:15.761 --> 18:18.305
-Oh, shit. Sorry. I didn't even know.
-Goodbye.

18:19.014 --> 18:20.265
-I am.

18:20.349 --> 18:23.018
-Hi. I recognized you from your website.
-Nice to meet you.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.228
I'm Mickey, the bride.

18:24.311 --> 18:25.270
Nice to meet you.

18:25.354 --> 18:27.147
-Feels pretty weird to say that.

18:27.231 --> 18:29.316
-You get used to it.
-Okay, cool.

18:29.399 --> 18:32.820
So, um, I was thinking for the ceremony,
just move right through it.

18:32.903 --> 18:35.114
-Got it.
-And I don't know about God stuff.

18:35.197 --> 18:37.324
I'll have to ask Gus, but I'm thinking no.

18:37.407 --> 18:38.617
-Okay.
-And, um...

18:41.036 --> 18:42.830
I just wanna say,
I think it's really funny,

18:42.913 --> 18:44.164
and I'm not gonna tell anybody.

18:45.249 --> 18:46.625
I don't know what you're talking about.

18:46.708 --> 18:48.961
Neither do I. Shh!

18:49.628 --> 18:51.588
I'm the guy that gets it.
-Okay.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.092
-Okay, Truman.
-Hmm.

18:55.217 --> 18:58.428
Um, okay, so we wrote our own vows.
We're gonna deliver those.

18:58.512 --> 18:59.471
Okay, great.

18:59.555 --> 19:02.474
I kinda want the vibe to be
<i>Mamma Mia! </i>meets <i>Elvira.</i>

19:03.267 --> 19:04.518
-I'll do my best.
-Okay, cool.

19:18.907 --> 19:21.076
-No.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.828
I love no.

19:22.911 --> 19:25.831
Hey, what is it about no
you don't understand?

19:25.914 --> 19:28.000
Right? All of it.

19:28.083 --> 19:30.335
What the fuck, Bertie

19:31.128 --> 19:32.796
Were you two hooking up
when me and you were together?

19:32.880 --> 19:34.131
What? No, no, no.

19:34.214 --> 19:36.466
Come on. I'm not dumb, okay?

19:36.550 --> 19:38.719
We break up, and then
immediately afterwards you're cool

19:38.802 --> 19:41.096
with just touching his hand
at a party with all my friends?

19:41.180 --> 19:42.598
You're gonna regret this.

19:43.265 --> 19:45.934
There'll come a time where I do something,
like, really important,

19:46.018 --> 19:48.604
and I'm gonna become super famous
or super rich,

19:48.687 --> 19:51.982
or both,
and you're gonna feel so fucking dumb

19:52.065 --> 19:54.359
when you have to tell people
that you broke up with me.

19:54.443 --> 19:56.111
I really hope that's true, Randy.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.279
It'll be true.

19:57.988 --> 19:59.698
-Hey.

19:59.781 --> 20:01.033
Hey, everything cool?

20:01.116 --> 20:03.368
Yeah, everything's cool with me.

20:03.452 --> 20:05.746
Always has been. Always will be.

20:05.829 --> 20:09.458
It's you guys who are gonna make today
extremely uncomfortable for everybody.

20:09.541 --> 20:13.045
Uh... Randy, you wanna maybe--
We could take a walk,

20:13.128 --> 20:15.505
you know, talk things over or something?

20:15.589 --> 20:18.800
Yeah, take a walk and miss
my two best friends getting married?

20:18.884 --> 20:21.136
No fucking way, buddy. You know what?

20:21.887 --> 20:25.641
You two are the jerks. I'm not the jerk.
You two are.

20:27.684 --> 20:29.269
Oh, shit.

20:29.937 --> 20:32.564
-Hey, question. I'm working on this toast.
-Mm-hmm.

20:32.648 --> 20:35.192
I wanted to run it by you.
We're gonna have time for a toast, right?

20:35.275 --> 20:38.487
Definitely. Yeah. If you want time
for a toast, we'll make some time.

20:38.570 --> 20:39.821
Dope. I'm gonna tell a story

20:39.905 --> 20:41.198
about how Mickey showed up
at work that time

20:41.281 --> 20:42.449
when we were doing a table read,

20:42.532 --> 20:45.744
and you guys started arguing outside,
and we were all watching it.

20:45.827 --> 20:46.995
I got this video on my phone.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.789
I might even show you guys
while I'm doing the toast.

20:48.872 --> 20:53.210
-It was hilarious, man.
-Yeah, that's a funny story.

20:53.293 --> 20:55.963
I-- I think you might wanna
skip that one, though.

20:56.046 --> 20:57.756
-All right, that's cut.
-Okay.

20:57.839 --> 21:00.717
Okay. All right. What about
when you were house-sitting,

21:00.801 --> 21:02.594
and I came over,
and you didn't even know I was there.

21:02.678 --> 21:04.429
I was upstairs,
and you guys started arguing.

21:04.513 --> 21:07.099
You guys were going at it, man.
I heard her throw something at you.

21:07.182 --> 21:09.518
I was like,
"Oh, my God. She's gonna kill Gus."

21:09.601 --> 21:11.728
I was so ready to be a witness
at your murder trial.

21:11.812 --> 21:14.690
Actually, I don't even think
we'll have time for a toast,

21:14.773 --> 21:16.108
now that I think about it.

21:16.191 --> 21:17.693
I'm figuring out the time,
and I'm like,

21:17.776 --> 21:20.195
"We're not gonna have time for a toast.
Let's skip the toast."

21:20.279 --> 21:23.073
-Okay. All right.

21:23.156 --> 21:24.283
Thanks, buddy.

21:25.158 --> 21:26.785
-Toast to no toast.
-Yeah.

21:30.831 --> 21:34.876
Man, that guy has not taken
my advice once. Mickey is batshit.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.296
Yeah, everybody's batshit.

21:38.380 --> 21:42.301
Mickey and Gus and Bertie and Chris.

21:43.635 --> 21:45.137
Jury's out on you, Kevin.

21:46.513 --> 21:47.764
Extra large OJ, please.

21:48.432 --> 21:51.059
Yeah, I feel good.
It's just, you know...

21:51.143 --> 21:53.395
It's sort of a symphony
of different feelings.

21:53.478 --> 21:56.356
Yeah, it's a big day.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally.

21:56.440 --> 21:57.399
Gus?

21:57.482 --> 22:00.444
One second. Excuse me.
Pardon me. Pardon me.

22:02.404 --> 22:03.822
All right, beautiful people,

22:03.905 --> 22:05.324
it's time to head down to the beach,

22:05.407 --> 22:07.868
'cause we're gonna try and do this
before the sun goes down.

22:07.951 --> 22:09.328
It's wedding time!

22:11.580 --> 22:13.123
Uh, hold on, everyone.

22:13.206 --> 22:15.334
Uh, I just wanna say something first.

22:15.417 --> 22:18.086
No, no, no. Please, no.
Please don't do this now, please.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.130
-Randy, you don't have to... It's okay.
-No.

22:20.213 --> 22:23.967
-Let's just go to do the wedding.
-No, this won't be bad. It will be good.

22:24.426 --> 22:27.679
I just wanna say,
in front of everybody gathered here,

22:28.513 --> 22:32.059
that Bertie was right
in breaking up with me.

22:33.018 --> 22:34.561
-Great.
-Okay, that's nice.

22:34.644 --> 22:36.229
Nice. Thank you, Randy.

22:36.313 --> 22:41.860
You deserve somebody better than me,
and Chris is a lot better than me.

22:41.985 --> 22:43.195
We don't have to dance around it.

22:44.196 --> 22:45.697
He's strong.

22:45.781 --> 22:50.077
He can lift lots of stuff
and doesn't have a beard.

22:50.452 --> 22:54.790
Doesn't live in his car. I mean,
he doesn't even believe in ghosts,

22:54.873 --> 22:56.374
and I'm afraid of ghosts.

22:57.501 --> 23:00.587
I'm not gonna stand
in the way of happiness,

23:00.670 --> 23:04.549
because you deserve
a great guy just like Chris.

23:05.342 --> 23:09.179
Just like Gus deserves
a great girl like Mickey,

23:09.262 --> 23:12.557
and Mickey deserves a great guy like Gus.

23:18.188 --> 23:19.147
Was that it?

23:19.815 --> 23:22.359
That's it. Uh, yeah. Thank you. Thank you.

23:22.776 --> 23:25.153
-That's very sweet, Randy. Thank you.
-Okay.

23:25.237 --> 23:28.073
All right. Ahem.
And on that note,

23:28.156 --> 23:29.366
let's go get married.

23:29.449 --> 23:33.245
Yeah, come on! It's good.
It's all right. Hey.

23:43.547 --> 23:46.716
Mickey and Gus have requested
to share their vows.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.093
Who wants to start?

23:51.012 --> 23:53.723
-Ugh, fine. I'll bite the bullet. Okay.

23:53.807 --> 23:56.810
Uh, don't judge, guys.
I wrote these in, like, an hour.

23:58.478 --> 24:01.773
"So, Gus, what's up?

24:04.734 --> 24:05.986
My Gus-Gus.

24:09.447 --> 24:13.160
From the moment you killed some
gross bugs for me in my bedroom,

24:14.369 --> 24:16.496
-I knew you were the one.
That's my chair!

24:16.580 --> 24:17.581
-We saved these...
Sorry.

24:17.664 --> 24:21.084
-Ever since, I knew I could trust you...
We put shirts on this chair!

24:21.168 --> 24:24.254
-to keep me safe, make me feel loved.
I didn't see them.

24:24.337 --> 24:27.549
Why would I lie about it?
-And I promise to believe in you...

24:27.632 --> 24:28.675
You mayor of the beach?

24:28.758 --> 24:29.759
-and support you...
Sit in any chair you want?

24:29.843 --> 24:31.386
I didn't see any shirt.

24:31.470 --> 24:34.681
and always be the person
who's unafraid to love more.

24:35.307 --> 24:36.558
You steal my shirt?
-I prom--"

24:36.641 --> 24:38.143
Is that what the fuck's going on Babe, chill.
I've been here three hours.

24:39.811 --> 24:42.439
-Fuck you! We saved these for the sunset.
-Baby.

24:42.522 --> 24:44.024
Stop!
Don't touch me!

24:44.107 --> 24:46.234
Get out of the chair! Get out!

24:46.318 --> 24:48.361
Should we just, like, wait a minute or...

24:49.070 --> 24:50.906
-Stop! Quit it!
Hey!

24:50.989 --> 24:53.700
God damn it.
-It's okay. It's all right.

24:53.783 --> 24:55.911
Stop!
-It's actually kinda funny.

24:55.994 --> 24:58.038
We're gonna wait for these assholes
to work it out.

24:58.121 --> 24:59.789
Hey! Cut it out! Come on!

24:59.873 --> 25:03.502
Baby

25:03.585 --> 25:05.462
Something's not right. Call 911.

25:05.545 --> 25:07.714
Medic, please! Somebody help! Baby?

25:07.797 --> 25:09.257
What's happening?
-I don't know.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.009
-A heart attack or something.
-Okay.

25:11.092 --> 25:14.179
Jesus Christ. He looks half dead.

25:14.262 --> 25:17.182
-Should we take a break or...
-I guess.

25:17.265 --> 25:19.768
Guys, we're gonna take a break.
Like, a ten minute break.

25:19.851 --> 25:21.561
-It'll be fine.
Yeah.

25:22.354 --> 25:26.858
Called it. I knew it was a joke.
It's a prank.

25:31.363 --> 25:35.951
I don't know. So, what do we do now?
Is that, like, a bad omen?

25:37.702 --> 25:40.622
Definitely not a good vibe for a wedding.

25:49.798 --> 25:50.924
You can say it.

25:51.007 --> 25:53.593
Should we just not do it?

25:53.677 --> 25:56.388
Yes, I was thinking the exact same thing.

25:56.471 --> 25:58.932
I mean, the whole thing felt
just a little... I don't know...

25:59.516 --> 26:02.185
-Rash. It felt fucking rash.
-Yeah.

26:02.269 --> 26:04.813
And we'll just tell them
we're gonna do it another time,

26:04.896 --> 26:07.357
and they will not care
because they all came here to party.

26:07.440 --> 26:09.859
-And they'll get to party. It's fine.
-Yeah.

26:12.904 --> 26:15.573
So, what about us

26:15.657 --> 26:19.911
Are we engaged

26:19.995 --> 26:24.207
No, I don't think engaged,
but I think we're good.

26:24.291 --> 26:26.668
I think we're, like, really good.

26:27.294 --> 26:28.795
Yes, agreed.

26:29.421 --> 26:32.590
I think this is the healthiest,
most mature thing...

26:33.466 --> 26:37.762
you know, for you.
Definitely for me. For us.

26:37.846 --> 26:38.680
Yes.

26:39.597 --> 26:42.183
That's perfect. You're perfect.

26:42.267 --> 26:43.351
You're perfect.

26:49.232 --> 26:50.942
Hey, what's up, you guys?

26:51.026 --> 26:52.694
-Hey.
-Hey.

26:52.777 --> 26:55.322
Good news.
Remember the guy who, like, hit the deck

26:55.405 --> 26:57.032
and then was foaming from the mouth?

26:57.115 --> 26:58.867
Yeah, he was very memorable.

26:58.950 --> 27:02.954
Yeah, well...
He's gonna be okay, not dead.

27:03.038 --> 27:05.206
-Oh, that is good news.
-Good, good.

27:05.290 --> 27:07.250
Hey, listen, everybody, um...

27:08.626 --> 27:14.466
We just felt like the timing
and the energy was off now, so...

27:14.549 --> 27:16.301
we're not getting married today.

27:16.384 --> 27:17.886
Aw.
Boo.

27:17.969 --> 27:20.096
But, hey, not for any bad reasons.

27:20.180 --> 27:21.973
We're still very much in love.

27:22.057 --> 27:25.310
It's just we wanna, you know,
do the responsible thing.

27:25.393 --> 27:28.688
Yeah, and please, we still want
you guys to stick around

27:28.772 --> 27:30.231
and hang out and party,

27:30.315 --> 27:34.986
so let's just call it the
"We're Trying to Grow As People" party.
