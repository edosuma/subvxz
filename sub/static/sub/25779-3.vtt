WEBVTT

00:05.750 --> 00:09.414
And so that I may someday see

00:09.550 --> 00:10.870
that which is hidden...

00:11.550 --> 00:14.679
I submit myself as squire
to the Order.

00:14.800 --> 00:17.428
Obscurum per obscurius.

00:18.430 --> 00:19.511
And I...

00:21.060 --> 00:22.471
Shit. I...

00:23.770 --> 00:25.147
God. Sorry.

00:25.270 --> 00:26.431
Sorry. I...

00:27.230 --> 00:28.891
Hold on. And I vow. I vow.

00:29.020 --> 00:31.432
And I vow to abide

00:31.570 --> 00:33.277
in silence and mystery,

00:33.400 --> 00:35.528
and... and...

00:35.660 --> 00:39.073
And I vow to abide
in silence and mystery

00:39.200 --> 00:41.999
and accept the exile
our knowledge requires.

00:42.120 --> 00:44.031
Lux et tenebris.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.207
Your oath is sealed, and...

00:50.710 --> 00:53.759
-What the hell?
-We've got a busted pipe somewhere.

00:53.880 --> 00:55.712
I saw another leak in the men's room.

00:56.180 --> 00:58.717
- _Don't look at me!
This is your area of expertise.

00:59.140 --> 01:01.268
-I'm not a plumber, I'm a salesman.
-Whatever.

01:01.390 --> 01:05.224
We shouldn't be doing this, anyway,
without the Sovereign Protector.

01:05.349 --> 01:06.681
You heard the message.

01:06.810 --> 01:10.064
-I'm in charge until Larry gets back.
-Gentlemen, please!

01:16.240 --> 01:18.151
Your oath is sealed...

01:18.950 --> 01:20.611
and your path is waiting.

01:20.990 --> 01:21.980
Arise.

01:28.380 --> 01:30.587
As above...

01:30.960 --> 01:32.121
...So below.

01:34.510 --> 01:36.547
All right, man. You're official.

01:39.680 --> 01:40.806
Let's take a picture!

01:42.390 --> 01:43.926
We can put it in the newsletter,

01:44.060 --> 01:45.471
in case we ever do another one.

01:45.600 --> 01:46.590
Yeah.

01:47.020 --> 01:48.681
It feels like we just got married.

01:51.730 --> 01:53.357
This place used to be packed!

01:53.480 --> 01:55.107
It was a golden age.

01:55.860 --> 01:57.350
For white guys with crew cuts.

01:57.910 --> 02:00.368
I bet most of those guys
worked in aerospace.

02:01.080 --> 02:03.230
This is Larry's mom.

02:03.740 --> 02:04.741
-Really?
-Yeah.

02:04.870 --> 02:07.111
She was Sovereign Protector here
for a few years.

02:07.250 --> 02:09.241
Larry pretty much grew up
in the Lodge.

02:13.590 --> 02:15.501
Hey, sorry I took off
like that. I...

02:15.630 --> 02:17.507
I hate hospitals
and I hate doctors.

02:17.630 --> 02:20.133
I'm back home now
and taking a sovereign sabbatical.

02:20.260 --> 02:23.673
You know the drill - no calls or
visits, unless it's an emergency.

02:24.100 --> 02:26.171
Ernie,
it's your show until I'm back.

02:27.560 --> 02:29.301
How many times
will you listen to that?

02:29.940 --> 02:31.851
Well, don't you think
something's off?

02:32.690 --> 02:34.180
I mean, what is he doing?

02:34.320 --> 02:37.642
And... why is he getting
all this mail from China?

02:37.780 --> 02:39.851
Larry's been on sabbaticals before.

02:40.530 --> 02:42.692
Well,
I've got a weird feeling about it.

02:43.410 --> 02:44.821
Cop intuition, you know?

02:46.080 --> 02:47.570
I am glad London's coming.

02:48.120 --> 02:51.169
If Larry has lost it,
they are gonna put things in order.

02:52.750 --> 02:56.300
All right. Hope this place
doesn't collapse while I'm gone.

02:56.420 --> 02:57.501
Where are you going?

02:58.010 --> 03:01.002
Me and guys from work are gonna take
the Sea-Doos out to the river.

03:01.140 --> 03:03.791
-What about the Scout breakfast?
-Connie's gonna cover.

03:07.470 --> 03:08.596
Attention.

03:08.730 --> 03:09.845
I just want to say...

03:10.730 --> 03:12.607
well done, Dud.

03:13.520 --> 03:15.318
Is this what I think it is?

03:19.240 --> 03:20.230
Yeah!

03:32.460 --> 03:34.872
All right. Are you ready to order?

03:35.340 --> 03:37.297
I don't see the St. Patrick stir-fry.

03:37.420 --> 03:39.502
Oh, I'm sorry.
That's a seasonal item.

03:40.760 --> 03:42.250
Could you ask the chef to make it?

03:42.550 --> 03:43.676
The chef?

03:43.800 --> 03:46.929
Yeah. I mean, if you guys have
the ingredients back there, it's...

04:14.880 --> 04:16.029
Oh, my God.

04:17.920 --> 04:19.125
So, how was it?

04:19.630 --> 04:21.791
Did they sodomize you in a dungeon?

04:23.380 --> 04:24.381
Yep.

04:25.180 --> 04:26.500
And then we had pizza.

04:27.430 --> 04:28.420
Lizard...

04:29.010 --> 04:30.421
you should come down, OK?

04:30.560 --> 04:32.426
You can put drinks on my tab.

04:32.560 --> 04:35.643
-So, you're a squire now?
-Oh, yeah.

04:36.560 --> 04:38.688
Great. Does that come with a salary?

04:39.440 --> 04:40.930
-Oh, my God.
-That's right.

04:41.070 --> 04:43.562
Brother Drag and Sister Nag
together again.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.442
I've been checking in
with Temp Joy every day.

04:46.570 --> 04:47.560
Nada.

04:47.700 --> 04:50.533
No, you've been sitting around
all week, reading.

04:50.830 --> 04:51.991
Well, yeah.

04:52.120 --> 04:55.078
You know,
it's an adventure... of the mind.

04:57.380 --> 04:58.700
You owe me three grand.

04:59.590 --> 05:00.705
Don't forget that.

05:01.670 --> 05:02.660
OK.

05:04.010 --> 05:05.000
Love you.

06:13.330 --> 06:14.320
Hello?

06:17.580 --> 06:19.321
Yeah. Hey, Ross.

06:20.790 --> 06:23.373
Yeah. Yeah, I remember,
from Temp Joy.

06:29.550 --> 06:30.790
Yeah, I guess I'm free.

06:32.810 --> 06:35.347
I spent my entire dream at work.

06:35.850 --> 06:38.763
There was nothing weird happening.
It was just like...

06:39.940 --> 06:40.930
this.

06:43.020 --> 06:44.681
Maybe you're dreaming now.

06:45.110 --> 06:47.772
I'm working two jobs right now.
I dream about both.

06:47.900 --> 06:49.652
It's a basic feature of capitalism.

06:49.780 --> 06:51.612
You can't get loose,
even on weekends.

06:51.740 --> 06:54.903
You reach the citadel,
the man in the tower shoots you dead.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.826
That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

06:58.710 --> 07:02.499
You need some different colors
in here, and different shapes.

07:04.420 --> 07:06.582
I'm gonna send you to my apothecary.

07:30.820 --> 07:32.026
Are you from Temp Joy?

07:33.370 --> 07:36.283
Yeah, I'm Sean Dudley.
I'm supposed to talk with Gloria.

07:36.410 --> 07:37.730
That's me. I'm head of HR.

07:38.160 --> 07:40.322
You must be o
one of the last people on their list.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.418
I've had three temps quit on me
this week. I don't know why.

07:43.540 --> 07:45.247
It's the easiest job in the world.

07:45.380 --> 07:46.495
A child could do it.

07:46.880 --> 07:48.757
All you do
is collate the colored sheets

07:48.880 --> 07:51.008
and put them in the folder,
like you see here.

07:51.340 --> 07:53.047
Do you think you can handle that?

07:53.180 --> 07:54.750
Yep, pretty sure I can.

07:55.180 --> 07:56.170
OK.

07:56.970 --> 07:58.176
What are these?

08:00.520 --> 08:01.806
Termination packets.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.321
Hello! What may I help you with?

08:20.120 --> 08:21.326
Gerson sent me.

08:21.460 --> 08:22.950
Gerson? Oh, yeah!

08:23.080 --> 08:24.957
That kid is really plugged in.

08:25.080 --> 08:26.411
Let's get you set up.

08:26.540 --> 08:29.373
How may I assist you
in your healing process?

08:29.500 --> 08:31.377
I just want to get high.

08:31.510 --> 08:33.126
That is healing.

08:33.880 --> 08:36.042
Are these items recreational?
Of course.

08:36.179 --> 08:39.764
Insofar as they allow us
to recreate ourselves,

08:39.890 --> 08:42.347
get back in touch with
our subconscious.

08:42.480 --> 08:45.142
Now, modern man
lives on the surface--

08:45.270 --> 08:48.399
-How much for the lollipops?
-Those are $15 each.

08:49.070 --> 08:50.185
Are you serious?

08:50.900 --> 08:53.699
You're paying for quality.
That's my own blend.

09:25.100 --> 09:26.090
Liz?

09:29.360 --> 09:30.509
Hi, Monsignor.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.486
What brings you here?

09:36.030 --> 09:38.909
Well, I got a burrito
from the truck across street,

09:39.030 --> 09:40.612
and then I wandered in here.

09:40.990 --> 09:42.287
Liz, are you high?

09:42.790 --> 09:43.780
Yes.

09:44.120 --> 09:46.498
Any chance you came in here
thinking about your dad?

09:47.790 --> 09:49.497
It's time to do a memorial service.

09:50.420 --> 09:51.990
It's pointless.

09:52.550 --> 09:55.622
-Dud's not ready. He can't handle it.
-He needs the closure.

09:55.760 --> 09:57.046
You both do.

09:59.140 --> 10:00.346
Don't worry about me.

10:01.350 --> 10:02.556
I am good.

10:03.060 --> 10:05.597
You and Dud have gone your own way,
and that's fine.

10:06.310 --> 10:08.551
But your dad was a beloved member
of this parish.

10:09.190 --> 10:11.056
His friends deserve to say goodbye.

10:11.190 --> 10:12.396
Monsignor, I...

10:12.900 --> 10:15.062
I appreciate the thought,
I really do,

10:15.190 --> 10:18.239
but I have other things
to worry about.

10:18.360 --> 10:20.362
We can take a collection in his name,

10:20.490 --> 10:22.777
donate it
to whatever charity you want.

10:27.410 --> 10:28.411
No.

10:33.250 --> 10:35.378
It's got to be the secretary, right?

10:35.510 --> 10:37.046
Her alibi was bullshit.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.218
No, they cleared her
through DNA evidence.

10:39.340 --> 10:40.922
Get your head in the game. Let's go.

10:42.800 --> 10:44.461
What's this one called again?

10:44.600 --> 10:45.590
The, like...

10:46.430 --> 10:49.730
Pro... Proceduralist, or something?

10:50.440 --> 10:52.181
The Proceduralist?

10:52.310 --> 10:54.813
What are you talking about?
You're wasted.

10:54.940 --> 10:56.351
I am wasted.

10:56.490 --> 10:57.935
I need to go to bed.

10:58.070 --> 10:59.697
Oh, yeah

10:59.820 --> 11:01.026
I'm gonna go to bed, too,

11:01.160 --> 11:04.949
because I am
a working stiff now, so...

11:05.080 --> 11:07.151
-It's a good start.
-Yeah.

11:07.660 --> 11:11.244
And now I can finally pay Burt back,
which is, like, such a relief.

11:12.080 --> 11:13.411
You mean pay me back.

11:14.710 --> 11:16.542
Actually, I meant to tell you,

11:16.670 --> 11:19.128
I had to take another loan out
to join the Lodge,

11:19.260 --> 11:20.250
SO...

11:21.130 --> 11:22.131
Yeah.

11:22.260 --> 11:24.092
Wait. You took out another loan?

11:24.890 --> 11:27.552
Jesus! How many times
do I have to bail you out?

11:27.680 --> 11:29.421
No, no, no. Liz, it's not like that.

11:29.560 --> 11:31.346
See, I'm a made man at Temp Joy,

11:31.480 --> 11:34.108
so I've got a steady income,
I can pay you back...

11:34.610 --> 11:35.600
eventually.

11:36.190 --> 11:38.739
Dud, it scares me
how much you're like Dad.

11:39.320 --> 11:40.139
What?

11:40.280 --> 11:41.736
You don't think about tomorrow.

11:41.860 --> 11:43.066
No, you're just gonna...

11:43.700 --> 11:46.158
bounce along until it's too late.

11:46.280 --> 11:48.078
Too late

11:54.960 --> 11:57.122
You know,
I saw Monsignor Guzman today.

11:57.630 --> 11:59.416
He wants to do a memorial for Dad.

11:59.550 --> 12:01.791
I said no
because it would be too hard for you.

12:02.380 --> 12:03.381
Good.

12:03.510 --> 12:04.671
But I'm gonna call him back

12:04.800 --> 12:06.802
to set up something for Saturday,

12:06.930 --> 12:09.262
because you have to do this, Dud.

12:09.640 --> 12:11.051
It's time to say goodbye.

12:15.230 --> 12:16.220
OK.

12:17.360 --> 12:18.350
OK.

12:18.480 --> 12:19.527
OK. Let's do it.

12:21.150 --> 12:22.140
Let's do it.

12:23.610 --> 12:25.692
I feel like you're doing this
to piss me off.

12:25.820 --> 12:27.447
I'm doing this for my own reasons.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.070
All you need to do is show up.

12:35.500 --> 12:37.377
That was fast. I appreciate it.

12:37.500 --> 12:39.161
I'll sort out the warranty for you.

12:39.710 --> 12:43.294
Hey, Ken Boyle told me you bid that
project Captain's doing in Torrance.

12:44.010 --> 12:45.330
Did you actually talk to him?

12:45.640 --> 12:46.630
Captain?

12:47.640 --> 12:50.962
Not even close. I talked to a guy
who was working with the architect.

12:51.100 --> 12:54.309
Is Captain using the same architect
for the Orbis redevelopment?

12:54.730 --> 12:55.845
Orbis?

12:55.980 --> 12:59.518
Damn, Ernie! Straight to the top,
cutting out the middle man.

12:59.860 --> 13:02.101
I'm in the middle
of the middle men, man.

13:03.070 --> 13:03.889
What?

13:05.240 --> 13:06.310
I don't know.

13:06.660 --> 13:08.276
The name I heard was Kaplan.

13:08.410 --> 13:09.946
Apparently, he does hotels.

13:10.080 --> 13:13.072
The guy I talked to said he's
in the Winger building downtown.

13:13.460 --> 13:14.575
That's a good start.

13:20.800 --> 13:21.915
You're screwing me.

13:22.710 --> 13:24.041
Does that make you feel good?

13:24.800 --> 13:26.461
This is the best offer you'll get.

13:37.400 --> 13:38.470
What are you doing here?

13:38.860 --> 13:40.646
Hey. Temp job.

13:42.980 --> 13:46.314
Smart, yeah. Temps are the only ones
with job security.

13:50.700 --> 13:52.031
I'll see you around the Lodge.

13:53.870 --> 13:54.860
OK.

14:23.610 --> 14:24.600
Liz!

14:24.730 --> 14:25.777
Good to see you.

14:27.320 --> 14:28.810
-Want solr\Pe coffee?
-No.

14:28.950 --> 14:32.443
I wanted to let you guys know
that I talked to Monsignor Guzman,

14:32.580 --> 14:35.538
and we're having a memorial
for Dad on Saturday.

14:35.660 --> 14:36.650
That's great news.

14:37.660 --> 14:39.788
-It will be good for you guys.
-Yeah, closure.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.240
That's what it's all about.

14:41.380 --> 14:43.371
It's gonna be at four o'clock
in the church.

14:43.500 --> 14:46.629
If you could help get word out around
the parish, that would be great.

14:46.760 --> 14:49.548
Let everyone know that we're
taking up a special collection.

14:49.680 --> 14:52.889
I want to make a big donation
to Heal the Bay in Dad's name.

14:54.260 --> 14:55.842
-You got it.
-Great.

15:00.690 --> 15:02.431
Mark. Do you have a minute?

15:02.560 --> 15:04.722
Yeah. Actually, I'm glad you're here.

15:06.320 --> 15:07.560
I need to talk to you.

15:07.690 --> 15:08.691
About what?

15:10.030 --> 15:11.020
You first.

15:11.490 --> 15:12.480
OK.

15:13.580 --> 15:14.775
I've been thinking.

15:14.910 --> 15:18.995
I'd love to do a feature series
on the Orbis closedown.

15:19.120 --> 15:20.610
It's not really news any more.

15:20.750 --> 15:22.957
I know, but it's still a big story

15:23.080 --> 15:25.082
in terms of the history
of Long Beach.

15:25.210 --> 15:27.417
First we had ail,
then we had aerospace.

15:27.550 --> 15:28.540
What next?

15:29.920 --> 15:33.709
Don't worry, I'm still working on
the... the seal story.

15:34.140 --> 15:35.130
But this...

15:35.810 --> 15:36.800
Hear me out.

15:37.270 --> 15:40.308
I'm thinking
a series of local profiles.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.681
Nothing lyrical, I promise.

15:43.020 --> 15:46.433
I know a lot of these guys.
I see something in their faces.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.891
It's this mixture of pride
and fear and...

15:49.900 --> 15:51.948
They just look totally lost,
you know?

15:53.030 --> 15:54.441
I think I can capture that.

15:55.910 --> 15:57.116
Yes. Yep.

15:57.580 --> 15:58.650
Absolutely.

16:01.460 --> 16:02.575
OK.

16:03.080 --> 16:05.242
-OK.
-That's great!

16:05.750 --> 16:07.206
So, you wanted to talk to me?

16:09.800 --> 16:12.428
We are letting you go.

16:16.850 --> 16:18.249
You know, with the buyout,

16:18.390 --> 16:21.724
we're doing this big rebrand,
pivot-to-video thing, and there's...

16:22.060 --> 16:23.767
Well, there's no way around it.

16:24.520 --> 16:25.351
Wait.

16:26.230 --> 16:28.779
-You're serious?
-Yeah, and I'm sorry.

16:30.360 --> 16:34.194
Here is a press release
with more info.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.328
"In an age of accelerated
transformation,

16:43.460 --> 16:46.031
our mission is to become
an industry leader

16:46.170 --> 16:49.379
in the curation, optimization,

16:49.500 --> 16:52.663
and monetization of hyper content."

16:53.090 --> 16:54.751
What does that even mean?

16:54.880 --> 16:56.382
Just, you know, things are...

16:56.510 --> 16:57.921
things are moving fast.

16:58.720 --> 16:59.710
So...

17:00.220 --> 17:02.928
Anyway, on a personal note, I will...

17:03.060 --> 17:05.267
I will really miss your stories

17:05.400 --> 17:06.720
about the old newsrooms.

17:07.810 --> 17:08.810
And...

17:11.319 --> 17:13.948
-What are you doing?
-I'm making a private call. Get out.

17:14.450 --> 17:17.613
This... This is my... office.

17:20.910 --> 17:21.900
OK.

17:22.869 --> 17:23.905
Hey! What's up?

17:24.040 --> 17:25.609
I just got canned.

17:25.750 --> 17:26.876
What

17:28.460 --> 17:30.701
My... My ass has been "optimized."

17:31.210 --> 17:32.757
What the hell does that mean?

17:34.920 --> 17:36.831
Means I'm coming over this weekend.

17:40.010 --> 17:41.887
Why do you have tape on your fingers?

17:42.310 --> 17:43.300
Paper cuts.

17:45.140 --> 17:46.630
Thanks... for these.

17:48.520 --> 17:50.147
Good work. I appreciate it.

17:50.980 --> 17:51.970
Yeah.

17:52.110 --> 17:55.102
Well... a child can do it,
and so can 1.

17:59.450 --> 18:00.827
Sorry if I've been a little...

18:02.830 --> 18:06.209
Everyone's pissed about severance.
It's not what they were expecting.

18:07.210 --> 18:08.621
They get to yell at somebody.

18:09.460 --> 18:10.450
That's a gift.

18:13.550 --> 18:16.668
We've been closing down
for five years, building by building,

18:16.800 --> 18:18.256
department by department.

18:19.970 --> 18:22.598
People call me the Angel of Death.

18:24.350 --> 18:27.183
No, that's not fair.
You're just doing your job.

18:45.450 --> 18:47.032
-There you are! Thank God!
-What?

18:47.160 --> 18:49.663
I've been calling.
They're waiting. It looks bad on me.

18:49.790 --> 18:51.918
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be sorry. Just get in there.

18:53.340 --> 18:54.546
-Is this our guy?
-Yes.

18:54.670 --> 18:57.469
We'll do intros later.
Captain, our geologist is here.

18:57.590 --> 19:00.002
-We can get started.
-Good. Let's make it quick.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.210
Do you want a water?

19:05.220 --> 19:07.473
Water would be great. Thank you.

19:07.600 --> 19:08.590
Take a seat.

19:09.850 --> 19:13.263
So, like I was saying,
D-Day is coming up pretty fast.

19:13.400 --> 19:15.016
The billboards are ready.

19:15.150 --> 19:17.687
We've kept them enigmatic
to get people talking, Leo?

19:17.820 --> 19:19.561
Yeah. It's this new thing I invented.

19:19.700 --> 19:20.906
I call it "marketing."

19:22.070 --> 19:23.060
There you go.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.241
Are the timelines still good
for you, Captain?

19:29.370 --> 19:32.249
Yeah. I'm in the desert
but I'll be working the phones.

19:32.580 --> 19:34.708
I want our presentations
to be on point.

19:34.840 --> 19:38.253
We'll start from the ground up.
Environmental impact report. Go.

19:41.220 --> 19:43.336
Me? I don't know where to start.

19:43.470 --> 19:46.007
You don't have to be nervous.
Parker recommended you.

19:46.140 --> 19:48.768
-We trust Parker.
-OK, here's the thing.

19:50.060 --> 19:51.687
I don't know Parker,

19:51.810 --> 19:53.187
and I'm not a geologist.

19:53.690 --> 19:54.680
What?

19:55.110 --> 19:56.100
Then who are you?

19:58.860 --> 20:01.568
I'm sorry, but I think I crashed
your meeting by mistake.

20:01.700 --> 20:05.159
I thought you guys were just
building a hotel over there,

20:05.280 --> 20:08.284
but this looks like
an amazing project.

20:08.620 --> 20:10.281
I would love to be a part of it.

20:10.410 --> 20:13.163
My company, West Coast Super Sales,

20:13.290 --> 20:15.167
reps a toilet line...

20:15.790 --> 20:17.622
that I think would be great for this.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.583
-Toilets?
-We rep over 20 plumbing lines.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.007
Faucets, drains, whatever you need.

20:23.640 --> 20:25.881
Captain, I would love to sit down

20:26.010 --> 20:29.059
and talk with you about
West Coast Super Sales.

20:29.180 --> 20:31.478
Private meeting.
You have no right to be here.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.432
Please escort this gentleman out.

20:33.560 --> 20:34.846
I'll leave my line card.

20:34.980 --> 20:36.436
It has all of my info on it.

20:36.560 --> 20:38.062
Call me and we'll get together,

20:38.190 --> 20:40.522
and we'll talk about
West Coast Super Sales

20:40.650 --> 20:42.027
and your great project.

20:42.150 --> 20:43.481
Get Captain back on the line.

21:02.420 --> 21:04.548
-Oh, hey, Blaise.
-Good Lord!

21:04.680 --> 21:05.670
Sorry.

21:06.260 --> 21:07.466
How did you get in here?

21:08.640 --> 21:10.677
Ernie gave me a key.

21:11.850 --> 21:12.840
OK.

21:12.980 --> 21:16.723
But the bar doesn't open
officially until six.

21:17.060 --> 21:18.607
OK. Yeah, yeah.

21:19.070 --> 21:21.027
Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition?

21:22.900 --> 21:24.197
Heavy stuff!

21:25.320 --> 21:27.948
Countless heavens, countless suns.

21:28.070 --> 21:30.118
Yeah.
I'm trying to wrap my head around it.

21:30.240 --> 21:32.902
That and a bunch of other... things.

21:33.500 --> 21:34.820
What's all the stuff for?

21:34.960 --> 21:38.203
The emissary's coming from London
so I'm cleaning the Sentinel Suite.

21:38.670 --> 21:41.241
The Sentinel Suite

21:46.590 --> 21:47.716
Come on, I'll show you.

21:56.730 --> 21:58.471
Most Lodges have a suite.

21:58.980 --> 22:01.517
Sovereign Protectors stay in them
on their Grand Tour,

22:01.650 --> 22:04.108
and knights can use them
on their travels.

22:06.490 --> 22:07.480
It smells...

22:09.120 --> 22:10.235
It smells kind of...

22:10.780 --> 22:12.077
bad in here.

22:12.490 --> 22:13.696
Yeah, that... Mold.

22:15.460 --> 22:16.700
There's water damage.

22:18.120 --> 22:19.417
That's why I got this.

22:19.830 --> 22:22.083
Bay Leaf Irish Moss.

22:22.500 --> 22:23.661
On sale at CVS.

22:26.260 --> 22:27.967
I don't even know where to begin.

22:29.090 --> 22:31.172
You know,
I'm happy to do the cleaning.

22:32.470 --> 22:36.100
OK. There's fresh linens in here
and there's a broom right there.

22:36.230 --> 22:37.345
-That's...
-Yeah!

22:38.310 --> 22:41.723
Just make sure you sweep up
the... cockroach husks, all right?

22:41.860 --> 22:43.817
Yep, yep, yep. Got it.

22:48.530 --> 22:49.520
Before I go...

22:50.740 --> 22:52.651
I have a strange request.

22:57.660 --> 22:59.037
Look at that!

22:59.870 --> 23:02.589
What kind of doctor are you again?

23:02.710 --> 23:04.872
I studied
osteopathic manipulative therapy

23:05.000 --> 23:06.707
at Lancers University in Scottsdale,

23:06.840 --> 23:09.172
but my degree means nothing to me.

23:09.930 --> 23:12.467
Not just because
the school lost its accreditation.

23:16.970 --> 23:18.972
It's strange that it hasn't healed.

23:19.100 --> 23:22.513
Yeah, there wasn't much they could do
about the nerve damage.

23:23.150 --> 23:25.187
I know a herpetologist
I could talk to.

23:25.480 --> 23:28.393
No. No need. I haven't been
sexually active in months.

23:31.990 --> 23:34.869
The toenails,
is that because of the...

23:35.620 --> 23:36.610
the venom?

23:37.080 --> 23:39.367
No. No, a separate medical condition.

23:40.330 --> 23:41.912
It's genetic. It's fungus.

23:42.040 --> 23:44.031
My sister and I both have it.

23:44.420 --> 23:45.410
Yeah.

23:47.090 --> 23:48.080
Well, OK.

23:50.380 --> 23:51.711
I'll do some research.

23:53.300 --> 23:54.506
A little bit.

23:55.560 --> 23:57.005
Hey! There he is.

23:58.520 --> 24:00.010
A beer and a shot.

24:01.850 --> 24:05.889
Beer always tastes better
after a long, hard day of work, huh?

24:06.480 --> 24:07.641
Did you work today?

24:08.320 --> 24:11.358
Yeah. Temping over at Orbis.

24:12.990 --> 24:14.446
Give this man another round.

24:15.700 --> 24:18.488
In a few years,
that building will be a condo.

24:18.910 --> 24:21.208
-Well, is that good?
-It could be.

24:22.330 --> 24:23.320
Weekend plans?

24:25.130 --> 24:25.949
Nope.

24:26.090 --> 24:29.128
Don Fab fixed the karaoke machine,
so that's on for Saturday.

24:29.260 --> 24:30.250
Way to go, Don!

24:31.920 --> 24:35.709
Plus the big Scout breakfast
is Sunday morning,

24:35.850 --> 24:37.591
so... big weekend.

24:37.720 --> 24:39.552
Big weekend, yeah.

24:41.600 --> 24:42.635
Actually...

24:43.560 --> 24:48.760
my sister and I are having a memorial
service for my dad on Saturday.

24:48.900 --> 24:50.061
That's what I'm doing.

24:51.990 --> 24:53.196
Wasn't that a year ago?

24:54.490 --> 24:56.310
Yeah, but...

24:56.450 --> 24:59.613
we were waiting for the body to...

25:00.950 --> 25:01.940
you Know...

25:03.000 --> 25:06.959
wash up on shore,
and it never did, so...

25:08.340 --> 25:10.047
Never got around to having a funeral.

25:14.550 --> 25:15.927
That happens in the Navy.

25:17.220 --> 25:18.426
Accidents.

25:18.550 --> 25:21.303
Guys fall off the ship, disappear.

25:22.270 --> 25:23.260
You search...

25:23.810 --> 25:26.393
then... you call off the search.

25:27.440 --> 25:29.511
Full fathom five.

25:32.190 --> 25:34.739
-Full what?
-The ocean, man. That's all.

25:37.410 --> 25:38.400
Well...

25:39.370 --> 25:41.441
if you guys want to come on Saturday,

25:41.580 --> 25:44.402
it's at St. Fergus at four.

25:47.710 --> 25:48.700
I would...

25:49.710 --> 25:51.621
but I've got plans for the weekend.

25:52.800 --> 25:53.790
I can't.

25:55.550 --> 25:56.540
Hey.

25:57.090 --> 25:59.422
No worries.
It's really not a big deal, OK?

25:59.970 --> 26:04.009
Obviously,
it's not a very fun weekend activity.

26:05.690 --> 26:06.680
I can make it.

26:09.900 --> 26:10.890
Thanks.

26:16.110 --> 26:16.941
Pinball?

26:18.280 --> 26:19.156
Yeah.

26:26.040 --> 26:27.826
The water in my pool is green.

26:30.840 --> 26:31.830
Sorry, what?

26:33.590 --> 26:38.130
Sorry. The rsum Temp Joy sent over
said you worked on pools.

26:38.260 --> 26:39.250
Yeah.

26:41.970 --> 26:43.552
Do you have any recommendations?

26:45.350 --> 26:46.476
It's algae bloom.

26:46.890 --> 26:49.018
You've got
a water-circulation problem.

26:49.150 --> 26:50.299
Check the filters.

26:51.480 --> 26:53.016
Filters. Thank you.

26:56.610 --> 26:58.021
I started here as a temp.

27:01.030 --> 27:02.361
Twenty years ago.

27:02.780 --> 27:04.157
You must have really liked it.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.411
I met my husband here.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.320
He was an engineer.

27:13.170 --> 27:14.410
Did he get laid off?

27:15.300 --> 27:16.290
No.

27:16.960 --> 27:19.258
He quit and moved to Texas.

27:24.180 --> 27:24.999
OK.

27:35.070 --> 27:36.060
Hey.

27:38.860 --> 27:41.022
Is there any chance
you could work this weekend?

27:42.240 --> 27:44.777
We're still trying to catch up.

27:48.250 --> 27:49.069
Yeah.

27:49.660 --> 27:50.821
Yeah, OK.

27:52.830 --> 27:55.709
But I've got to be out of here
by three tomorrow,

27:55.840 --> 27:56.989
because I've got a thing.

27:57.130 --> 27:58.837
Sure. No problem.

27:59.720 --> 28:01.040
I'll let Temp Joy know.

28:03.050 --> 28:04.040
OK.

28:04.680 --> 28:05.670
See you.

28:12.020 --> 28:13.010
It's OK.

28:13.730 --> 28:14.720
It's OK.

28:16.020 --> 28:17.727
I didn't know. I didn't know.

28:18.230 --> 28:19.777
I wish you had told us, Liz.

28:20.360 --> 28:22.522
I would have recommended
somebody to talk to.

28:23.990 --> 28:26.698
I'm working a double Saturday,
but I'll try to sneak away.

28:27.330 --> 28:28.365
Oh, yeah.

28:28.490 --> 28:31.949
I'll talk to the staff, and you
should definitely take Saturday off.

28:32.080 --> 28:33.957
No, I'll come in for the lunch rush.

28:34.210 --> 28:36.372
Tell everyone about
the special collection.

28:37.090 --> 28:38.831
-Where is it?
-No, no.

28:39.340 --> 28:41.217
Yeah, I need a number three,
well-done.

29:14.460 --> 29:16.371
I can't wait for Larry to get back.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.991
Start planning my Grand Tour.

29:19.800 --> 29:21.791
He can tell Scott to stand down.

29:22.590 --> 29:25.799
Does Scott actually think Larry
might make him Sovereign Protector?

29:25.930 --> 29:28.638
What did I tell you? I don't want
to talk about any of that.

29:28.760 --> 29:32.640
I know, but at some point,
if I do the Grand Tour in the winter,

29:32.770 --> 29:36.092
maybe that would give you enough time
to do what you need to do.

29:36.230 --> 29:38.301
Then you can meet me
wherever you want.

29:41.030 --> 29:42.020
Sorry.

29:42.860 --> 29:43.850
Forget it.

29:44.570 --> 29:45.981
It's Saturday.

29:46.280 --> 29:47.816
We've got the whole day together.

29:48.660 --> 29:50.025
It's fine.

29:50.160 --> 29:51.286
Go take a shower.

30:58.520 --> 30:59.931
Same time tomorrow?

31:00.730 --> 31:01.549
Yes.

31:02.570 --> 31:04.356
-OK.
-Oh, hey.

31:07.900 --> 31:09.026
About my pool.

31:09.610 --> 31:11.237
I tried, but I don't think...

31:12.990 --> 31:15.231
Is there any chance
you could take a look?

31:20.330 --> 31:22.378
I'm sorry.
You said you had something...

31:22.500 --> 31:24.332
you had some place you had to go.

31:29.130 --> 31:30.291
No, it's not important.

31:31.260 --> 31:32.386
Hey, it's me again.

31:32.510 --> 31:33.966
I'm kind of freaking out here,

31:34.100 --> 31:35.465
so just give me a call.

31:36.180 --> 31:38.421
All right.
All right, take care. Bye-bye.

31:52.620 --> 31:54.110
My dad started off digging pools,

31:54.240 --> 31:56.789
and he said that when people
put a pool in back in the day,

31:56.910 --> 31:58.821
they would put in a bomb shelter
on the sly.

31:59.410 --> 32:02.823
How cool is that? There's probably
bomb shelters all over town.

32:04.960 --> 32:06.371
I never swim in it any more.

32:17.100 --> 32:18.716
Sweet, but Mom isn't all there.

32:19.270 --> 32:21.511
She still likes...
looking at the water.

32:24.440 --> 32:26.101
OK. Well, let's see what we've got.

32:27.900 --> 32:29.436
Let's see if we can...

32:30.740 --> 32:32.526
see what the problem is here.

32:36.200 --> 32:37.190
Oh, yeah.

32:38.200 --> 32:39.235
Oh, yeah.

32:57.550 --> 32:59.006
What are you smiling about?

33:03.810 --> 33:04.800
Nothing.

33:06.480 --> 33:07.470
Nothing.

33:11.360 --> 33:12.486
Hey, it's me.

33:12.610 --> 33:14.908
I guess you're flaking
on your dad's memorial.

33:15.410 --> 33:17.526
Have fun regretting that
the rest of your life.

33:23.870 --> 33:25.861
So, you're Dud's twin sister?

33:27.500 --> 33:28.535
This is weird.

33:28.880 --> 33:29.870
Is it?

33:30.210 --> 33:32.292
-How do you know Dud?
-The Lodge.

33:35.010 --> 33:36.000
Great.

33:36.890 --> 33:40.383
-Are you the Luminous Knight?
-I'm Ernie.

33:41.010 --> 33:42.466
I'm really sorry for your loss.

33:44.140 --> 33:45.130
Thank you.

33:46.600 --> 33:49.479
-You can put donations in here.
-Where's Dud?

33:54.150 --> 33:56.152
Thank you for coming. It's very kind.

33:58.450 --> 34:01.021
Thank you.
Oh, we're actually taking...

34:03.290 --> 34:04.405
Yeah, OK.

34:05.660 --> 34:07.913
<i>Yeah, you've got something
obstructing the 1.</i>

34:10.250 --> 34:12.753
My husband used
to clean the pool himself.

34:13.880 --> 34:16.371
All he did was complain about
what a hassle it was.

34:16.840 --> 34:19.002
OK. Oh, I've got it. Yeah.

34:22.389 --> 34:24.722
Yeah. Well, see, here's your problem.

34:24.850 --> 34:25.840
Thank you!

35:15.440 --> 35:17.772
-I'll see you at the office tomorrow.
-Yeah.

35:27.960 --> 35:30.418
Bill was always a good neighbor

35:30.540 --> 35:32.030
and a great friend.

35:33.000 --> 35:36.129
I never saw him
without a smile on his face,

35:36.260 --> 35:38.376
even with the pressure
he was under...

35:39.220 --> 35:41.791
raising Dud and Liz on his own,

35:41.930 --> 35:43.466
running a business.

35:45.310 --> 35:46.926
He made it work somehow.

35:47.060 --> 35:48.050
Hi.

35:48.600 --> 35:49.806
He loved Long Beach,

35:49.940 --> 35:51.510
and he loved the water.

35:52.690 --> 35:55.148
I miss seeing him in the mornings,

35:55.650 --> 35:57.140
coming back from the beach.

35:57.990 --> 35:58.980
Thank you.

36:10.580 --> 36:12.116
Liz, would you?

36:18.920 --> 36:19.910
Dud?

36:24.390 --> 36:25.380
Yeah.

36:26.720 --> 36:27.846
Yeah, OK.

36:48.620 --> 36:51.248
I remember one day last year.

36:53.210 --> 36:54.746
It was right before I went down...

36:55.710 --> 36:57.200
on my trip to Nicaragua.

36:59.420 --> 37:00.751
I surfed in the morning.

37:01.130 --> 37:02.291
I worked all day.

37:03.050 --> 37:05.087
Barbecued with Liz and Dad
at the house.

37:10.520 --> 37:11.635
It was perfect.

37:13.940 --> 37:17.683
But I didn't realize it was perfect
until later.

37:20.730 --> 37:22.983
For this whole past year,
I just felt like...

37:25.070 --> 37:27.061
I felt like that day
was gone forever...

37:28.580 --> 37:29.786
along with my dad.

37:32.200 --> 37:33.406
Saying goodbye...

37:35.170 --> 37:38.663
Saying goodbye, it seemed like
the hardest thing to do in the world.

37:41.630 --> 37:42.620
But now...

37:46.220 --> 37:48.461
Now I realize
I don't have to say goodbye...

37:51.430 --> 37:52.591
because time...

37:54.480 --> 37:55.686
is an illusion.

37:58.770 --> 38:02.183
See, we think of time as a one-way,

38:02.320 --> 38:04.277
irreversible process.

38:05.150 --> 38:06.811
Like, OK, say you have a log,

38:06.950 --> 38:08.736
and, you know, you set it on fire,

38:08.870 --> 38:10.156
and it burns down to ash

38:10.280 --> 38:12.362
and there's
no getting it back, right?

38:13.410 --> 38:14.400
Unless...

38:15.540 --> 38:16.951
Unless you're an alchemist.

38:18.170 --> 38:20.662
The Magnum Opus,
that's what it's all about.

38:21.420 --> 38:27.427
The truly great alchemists know
how to control matter and energy.

38:27.840 --> 38:30.218
It allows them to access eternity.

38:30.350 --> 38:33.923
They're sitting above the maze.
No past, no future.

38:34.890 --> 38:37.348
-Just the eternal moment of paradise.
-Dud--

38:37.480 --> 38:42.395
Everything that we think is gone
is still here, right in front of us.

38:42.520 --> 38:44.181
That's what alchemy teaches us to do.

38:44.320 --> 38:47.108
It teaches us to access
those hidden worlds.

38:47.240 --> 38:49.902
Countless heavens, countless suns,

38:50.030 --> 38:51.270
like Bruno said.

38:53.330 --> 38:56.288
Until the Pope burned him alive
for heresy. That's, you know...

38:56.410 --> 38:58.788
I'm not blaming you.
Times were different then.

38:59.460 --> 39:03.419
Anyway, I'd just like to thank
my new friends at the Lynx Lodge

39:03.550 --> 39:05.200
for helping me understand all this.

39:06.420 --> 39:07.410
And it's possible.

39:08.260 --> 39:10.331
It's possible to touch the sublime.

39:11.680 --> 39:13.000
Like today,

39:13.140 --> 39:15.461
<i>I saw a vision of my dad
in a scummy pool,</i>

39:15.600 --> 39:17.420
and then I pulled a dead rat
out of a pipe,

39:17.560 --> 39:19.471
and then it came back to life,
you know?

39:19.900 --> 39:22.551
And maybe there was an air pocket
in there, or whatever,

39:22.690 --> 39:24.727
but, either way,
I ended up with a hard-on.

39:25.230 --> 39:26.482
Oh, my God.

39:26.610 --> 39:27.429
And...

39:27.570 --> 39:29.311
No, but that's... not...

39:29.450 --> 39:30.849
You know, that's not what...

39:31.870 --> 39:32.985
I mean...

39:33.120 --> 39:34.690
That's neither here nor there.

39:36.160 --> 39:37.241
Sorry.

39:38.250 --> 39:41.880
Look, what I'm trying to say
is that we don't need to do all this.

39:42.380 --> 39:43.870
We don't need to say goodbye.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.707
Because my dad's still here.

39:54.550 --> 39:55.551
So...

39:56.390 --> 39:57.880
thanks for coming out.

39:58.020 --> 39:59.977
-What was all that shit?
-It was blasphemy.

40:00.100 --> 40:01.261
Dud, you sounded crazy.

40:01.390 --> 40:03.301
I was offering
a different perspective.

40:03.440 --> 40:07.183
Alchemy's no crazier than the
Resurrection or Transubstantiation.

40:07.320 --> 40:08.560
Who are you

40:08.690 --> 40:10.692
Why does the Church
think it has authority?

40:10.820 --> 40:13.403
I don't know, maybe a thing
called apostolic succession.

40:13.530 --> 40:15.237
-Sorry about this.
-Yeah, walk away.

40:15.370 --> 40:16.360
It was a nice service.

40:16.490 --> 40:19.198
Liz, at the shop I've got something
for your toenail fungus.

40:19.330 --> 40:22.038
Hey, come down to the Lodge later.
It's karaoke night.

40:26.130 --> 40:27.165
I can take that.

40:27.550 --> 40:29.917
It's fine, Liz.
I'll deposit it and send a check.

40:30.050 --> 40:31.506
No, I'd rather do it myself.

40:31.630 --> 40:34.679
-For our records, we need to--
-Just give me the money! I'll do it.

40:50.740 --> 40:52.105
Hey. Honey?

40:52.900 --> 40:53.901
Hey.

40:54.660 --> 40:55.980
Sorry that took so long.

40:56.370 --> 40:57.769
I drove as fast as I could.

40:58.410 --> 40:59.480
Was it a bad one?

41:01.290 --> 41:02.610
Yeah. Where did it happen?

41:03.710 --> 41:05.781
I was out running errands.

41:06.290 --> 41:07.280
OK.

41:07.840 --> 41:08.830
OK.

41:11.720 --> 41:12.790
All right.

41:13.680 --> 41:17.253
Everyone's trying to get it right

41:19.680 --> 41:20.670
Listen, man.

41:21.180 --> 41:23.182
There's no secrets,

41:23.310 --> 41:25.472
no hidden worlds out there.

41:25.600 --> 41:27.682
That's not what
the Lodge is all about.

41:27.810 --> 41:29.517
Then what's the Lodge about?

41:33.240 --> 41:36.619
Everybody's working for the weekend

41:37.410 --> 41:38.696
That's what it's about.

41:39.160 --> 41:40.286
Big Ben.

41:40.410 --> 41:43.710
Ace mechanic, bodywork.
If you get dinged, go see him.

41:44.710 --> 41:48.078
Anita, she's been teaching
fifth grade for 30 years.

41:48.210 --> 41:50.872
Every kid
in North Long Beach loves her.

41:51.380 --> 41:53.667
And Don Fab,

41:53.800 --> 41:55.541
he's a musical genius.

41:55.680 --> 41:58.081
He was Eddie Money's rhythm guitar

41:58.220 --> 41:59.881
on the "Where's the Party'?" tour.

42:01.100 --> 42:02.807
You better start from the start

42:03.310 --> 42:04.630
Who's Eddie Money?

42:07.650 --> 42:09.049
It ain't me!

42:09.440 --> 42:11.067
It ain't me!

42:11.190 --> 42:13.318
I ain't no senator's son!

42:13.440 --> 42:14.646
No!

42:14.990 --> 42:16.139
It ain't me!

42:16.740 --> 42:18.196
-It ain't me!
-Yeah!

42:18.620 --> 42:21.442
I ain't no fortunate one, no!

42:27.830 --> 42:29.958
I guess I'll call a cab.

42:30.750 --> 42:31.740
Screw it.

42:32.300 --> 42:34.166
I'm sleeping on the floor.

42:35.170 --> 42:37.923
There's...
There's the Sentinel Suite.

42:38.590 --> 42:39.796
I cleaned it.

42:40.220 --> 42:42.211
Come on, lightweight.

42:43.310 --> 42:44.129
Yeah.

42:44.270 --> 42:45.260
Yeah!

42:45.890 --> 42:47.437
-Yeah.
-There we go.

42:57.450 --> 42:58.906
Doesn't it smell good in here?

43:00.620 --> 43:03.829
Irish Bay Leaf Moss... or some shit.

43:04.700 --> 43:05.826
How do you know that?

43:06.910 --> 43:09.459
I forgot to take my shoes off.

43:09.580 --> 43:10.570
Yeah.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.411
Hello, toes!

43:22.050 --> 43:23.040
Dud?

43:28.690 --> 43:29.680
Dud?

43:29.810 --> 43:31.266
Ernie, you've got to see this!

43:42.320 --> 43:43.321
Hey.

43:44.740 --> 43:46.572
I think I'm in another room.

43:54.460 --> 43:55.450
Oh, yeah.
