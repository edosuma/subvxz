<i> Every day we make decisions.</i>

00:38.406 --> 00:41.640
<i> Decisions that get us</i>
<i> from one day to the next.</i>

00:41.642 --> 00:45.744
<i> Decisions that change our path</i>
<i> ever so slightly.</i>

00:46.747 --> 00:48.280
<i> Most go unnoticed.</i>

00:49.116 --> 00:51.216
<i> What should I wear today?</i>

00:51.218 --> 00:53.819
<i> What should I have for lunch?</i>

00:53.821 --> 00:57.189
<i> What route should I</i>
<i> take to work?</i>

00:57.191 --> 01:00.225
<i> Should I respond</i>
<i> to that text message?</i>

01:00.227 --> 01:03.328
<i> Will it warrant a rabbit hole</i>
<i> of unwanted conversation?</i>

01:03.330 --> 01:05.898
<i> Then there's</i>
<i> the other decisions,</i>

01:05.900 --> 01:08.233
<i> the kind that can change you,</i>

01:08.235 --> 01:10.836
<i> maybe even forever.</i>

01:10.838 --> 01:12.671
Uh, don't.

01:12.673 --> 01:15.140
Don't. You don't need to.
You don't need to turn around.

01:15.142 --> 01:16.842
Who cares?
I mean, she's fine.

01:16.844 --> 01:20.112
She'll probably be fine, right?
Probably fine.

01:20.114 --> 01:21.914
Fuck!
I mean, who the fuck cares?

01:21.916 --> 01:25.050
I don't even fucking know her.
Fuck! Fuck!

01:25.052 --> 01:31.290
<i> ¶ Time's running out,</i>
<i> and I'm ready for takeoff ¶</i>

01:32.927 --> 01:35.661
<i> ¶ Look to the sky and I'm- ¶</i>

01:35.663 --> 01:36.829
Hey!

01:37.965 --> 01:39.798
Hey!

01:39.800 --> 01:41.467
Oh, fuck.

01:42.570 --> 01:44.369
Shit.

01:45.673 --> 01:47.906
Come on, you crazy bitch,
vomit.

01:47.908 --> 01:49.141
Come on, come on.

01:49.143 --> 01:51.076
Come on.

01:51.078 --> 01:52.945
There you go.

01:52.947 --> 01:55.848
Oh, gross.

01:55.850 --> 01:58.584
Put me down.
Who are you?

01:58.586 --> 02:02.020
You can kill us both later.
I'm Harry, by the way.

02:02.022 --> 02:04.857
You're the fucking worst.

02:04.859 --> 02:06.425
You're welcome.

02:06.427 --> 02:09.127
<i>Well, she isn't entirely wrong.</i>

02:09.130 --> 02:10.662
<i> Huh? I could be the worst.</i>

02:10.663 --> 02:12.498
<i> Not that I'm a horrible guy.</i>

02:12.500 --> 02:14.700
<i> I just don't always make</i>
<i> the best decisions.</i>

02:33.587 --> 02:35.621
Oh, shit.

02:39.527 --> 02:41.894
What are you doing?
I've been calling you.

02:41.896 --> 02:43.428
<i> This is Lana.</i>

02:43.430 --> 02:45.664
<i> We've been dating</i>
<i> for three months.</i>

02:45.666 --> 02:47.366
<i> Maybe four.</i>

02:47.368 --> 02:48.467
<i> Could be two.</i>

02:48.469 --> 02:50.669
The TV was on loud.

02:51.906 --> 02:53.238
Come on in.

02:53.240 --> 02:54.406
I had plans to
make dinner tonight.

02:54.408 --> 02:56.508
It's date night.
Did you forget?

02:56.510 --> 02:57.809
No.

03:00.381 --> 03:02.714
Are you sleeping?

03:02.716 --> 03:04.249
No.

03:06.620 --> 03:07.986
Are you drunk?

03:07.988 --> 03:09.955
No.

03:09.957 --> 03:11.690
Stoned?

03:11.692 --> 03:12.925
No.

03:12.927 --> 03:15.260
Maybe.

03:15.262 --> 03:17.262
When did you get a fish?

03:17.264 --> 03:19.064
- Oh, yesterday.
- Why?

03:19.066 --> 03:22.701
I don't know. He's cool.
What's with the interrogating?

03:24.071 --> 03:25.671
<i> Paul McCartney once sang,</i>

03:25.673 --> 03:28.674
<i> "Yesterday, all my troubles</i>
<i> seemed so far away."</i>

03:28.676 --> 03:32.544
<i> But to be honest,</i>
<i> yesterday was shitty too.</i>

03:32.546 --> 03:34.379
<i> Except for getting a fish.</i>

03:36.150 --> 03:37.683
<i> Welcome to my office.</i>

03:37.685 --> 03:39.384
<i> I rob houses for a living.</i>

03:39.386 --> 03:41.320
<i> It's not the best</i>
<i> career choice,</i>

03:41.322 --> 03:43.822
<i> but it pays the rent.</i>

03:43.824 --> 03:47.059
<i> The guy in the green hat?</i>
<i> My cousin Chris.</i>

03:47.061 --> 03:48.994
<i> My partner in crime.</i>

04:12.186 --> 04:13.385
2-2-2-5.

04:13.387 --> 04:15.988
2-2-2-5, 2-2-2-5.

04:15.990 --> 04:18.957
2-2-2-5, 2-2-2-5.

04:22.296 --> 04:24.730
2-2-2-5, 2-2-2.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.966
2-2-2-5.

04:31.872 --> 04:35.474
<i> ¶¶</i>

04:38.646 --> 04:41.680
<i>¶ I wanna burn my own bridges ¶</i>

04:41.682 --> 04:44.650
<i> ¶ Walk my own road to ruin ¶</i>

04:46.287 --> 04:49.554
<i> ¶ Don't waste your breath</i>
<i> trying to stop me ¶</i>

04:49.556 --> 04:52.491
<i> ¶ I know for well</i>
<i> what I'm doing ¶</i>

04:54.595 --> 04:57.296
<i> ¶ I got time on my hands ¶</i>

04:57.298 --> 04:58.630
<i> ¶ Salt on my tongue ¶</i>

04:58.632 --> 05:00.732
<i> ¶ I'm going downtown ¶</i>

05:00.734 --> 05:02.634
<i> ¶ I'm gonna get myself stung ¶</i>

05:02.636 --> 05:04.970
<i> ¶ Yeah, I'm crazy ¶</i>

05:04.972 --> 05:08.507
<i> ¶ 'Cause all I wanna do</i>
<i> is wrong ¶</i>

05:23.324 --> 05:25.223
Coming, milady?

05:25.225 --> 05:28.126
<i> ¶ I'll be the first</i>
<i> to be taken ¶</i>

05:28.128 --> 05:31.096
<i> ¶ When they start</i>
<i> calling out names ¶</i>

05:33.200 --> 05:37.235
<i> ¶ I can't even remember</i>
<i>half the bad things I've done ¶</i>

05:37.237 --> 05:41.373
<i> ¶ But I'll wear the blame for</i>
<i> anything they wanna pin on ¶</i>

05:41.375 --> 05:43.875
<i> ¶ Yeah, I'm crazy ¶</i>

05:43.877 --> 05:46.878
<i> ¶ 'Cause all I wanna do</i>
<i> is wrong ¶</i>

05:49.350 --> 05:51.049
<i> ¶ I'm a bad penny, baby ¶</i>

05:51.051 --> 05:52.517
Fuck!

05:52.519 --> 05:54.953
<i> ¶ Right from my head</i>
<i> to my tail ¶</i>

05:57.658 --> 06:00.325
<i> ¶ And sooner or later ¶</i>

06:00.327 --> 06:02.894
<i>¶ I'm gonna fly off the rails ¶</i>

06:13.073 --> 06:14.339
Anything else?

06:14.341 --> 06:17.676
- No. We're good.
- Okay.

06:24.318 --> 06:26.017
Why do you do it?

06:26.019 --> 06:27.352
Do what?

06:27.354 --> 06:29.654
You take a piss
in every house we rob.

06:29.656 --> 06:31.056
Why?

06:31.058 --> 06:32.724
Marking my territory.

06:32.726 --> 06:35.160
Why don't you just take a dump?

06:35.162 --> 06:37.162
That's disgusting.

06:42.703 --> 06:45.003
- Whoa! What are you doing?
- I'm feeding him.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.304
Stop that.
They can't eat that.

06:46.306 --> 06:47.539
What? Why the fuck not?

06:47.541 --> 06:49.908
Because they're carnivores.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.210
You gotta feed 'em something
with a higher protein content.

06:52.212 --> 06:55.680
You know, like betta pellets
or bloodworms.

06:55.682 --> 06:58.517
What are you,
some sort of fish expert?

06:58.519 --> 07:01.286
No. It's just common knowledge.

07:01.288 --> 07:02.721
Okay.

07:11.398 --> 07:14.366
Look, I wanna talk to you
about something.

07:14.368 --> 07:15.634
What's up?

07:15.636 --> 07:19.171
I've been doing
a lot of thinking and...

07:19.173 --> 07:20.238
I got a job.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.673
What area?

07:21.675 --> 07:23.708
No, not like a rob job.

07:23.710 --> 07:26.478
Like, I got a real job.

07:27.981 --> 07:30.582
Okay, you know,
Aunt Lacy's friend, Esther?

07:30.584 --> 07:33.218
Yeah. I lost my virginity
to her.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.653
That's weird.

07:34.655 --> 07:38.690
Anyway, she got me a temp job
at this company

07:38.692 --> 07:40.859
as a paper distributor.

07:40.861 --> 07:43.128
I thought it'd be a really good
opportunity for me.

07:43.130 --> 07:46.598
Yeah, as long it doesn't
fuck up our shit.

07:48.168 --> 07:49.434
Ah, man.

07:49.436 --> 07:51.536
No, you're not getting it.

07:52.539 --> 07:53.972
I'm getting a real job

07:53.974 --> 07:55.674
so I don't have to do
our shit anymore.

07:55.676 --> 07:58.109
You know, like, I'm gonna be
28 years old, man,

07:58.111 --> 08:00.178
and I can't be
breaking into houses

08:00.180 --> 08:02.180
and stealing shit
the rest of my life.

08:02.182 --> 08:06.952
I don't wanna be some old loser
fucking robbing families.

08:06.954 --> 08:10.255
Like, what if I want
a family someday, man?

08:11.825 --> 08:14.059
I'm not gonna lie.
You sound crazy.

08:15.629 --> 08:18.029
You should get some sleep.

08:18.031 --> 08:20.799
Hey, I got a good job
on Friday in WeHo.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.834
It's gonna be fun.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.605
Did you hear me?

08:27.541 --> 08:30.075
Yeah, man, I heard you.

08:30.077 --> 08:31.142
Okay, good.

08:33.145 --> 08:35.113
But it's gonna be
my last one, Harry.

08:35.115 --> 08:36.847
Your last what?

08:36.850 --> 08:38.850
Robbery.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.485
Why do you not take
anything I say seriously?

08:40.486 --> 08:44.188
Can you please stop
yelling at me?

08:44.191 --> 08:45.257
Good night.

08:46.560 --> 08:49.261
Hey, I'll text you
Friday morning!

08:52.099 --> 08:53.798
Protein.

08:53.800 --> 08:56.768
<i>Okay, maybe I shouldn't</i>
<i> have stolen the kid's fish.</i>

08:56.770 --> 09:00.772
Great. Just what I need.
One more thing to take care of.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.078
So how's work?

09:07.080 --> 09:08.747
Usual.

09:10.584 --> 09:13.218
- Chris is apparently quitting.
- What?

09:13.220 --> 09:14.486
Yeah.

09:14.488 --> 09:16.021
Some stupid temp job.

09:16.023 --> 09:18.189
- Good for him.
- Good for him?

09:18.191 --> 09:19.457
Why good for him?

09:19.459 --> 09:21.259
It's just... nothing.

09:21.261 --> 09:23.128
I'm happy for him.

09:24.531 --> 09:26.264
Maybe you should
think about it too.

09:26.266 --> 09:27.766
Think about what?

09:27.768 --> 09:30.769
I don't know, quitting,
getting a real adult job.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.938
Not always avoiding
getting arrested.

09:32.940 --> 09:35.473
I like what I do.
I'm good at it.

09:35.475 --> 09:37.709
- I enjoy it.
- Okay.

09:37.711 --> 09:39.978
You know, it doesn't
make me less of a person

09:39.980 --> 09:42.781
than someone with
some shitty office job.

09:42.783 --> 09:44.449
Just means
I have more fun.

09:44.451 --> 09:46.284
I'm not boring.

09:46.286 --> 09:47.886
So how's work for you?

09:47.888 --> 09:50.889
Hmm. Do you actually
wanna know?

09:50.891 --> 09:53.124
I'm asking, aren't I?

09:53.126 --> 09:55.760
Guys move locations
or something?

09:55.762 --> 09:58.930
I didn't actually think
you were listening.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.566
I'm a great listener.

10:01.568 --> 10:03.802
Well, I like it. It's a little
farther from my house,

10:03.804 --> 10:05.503
so it takes me
like 10 minutes longer.

10:05.505 --> 10:11.276
You know, and with traffic,
it'd take like half an hour,

10:11.278 --> 10:14.079
so yeah.

10:14.081 --> 10:16.181
That's awesome.

10:16.183 --> 10:18.316
<i>I think both of us know</i>
<i> this relationship is over,</i>

10:18.318 --> 10:19.884
<i> but neither one of us</i>
<i> has decided</i>

10:19.886 --> 10:22.821
<i> to do anything about it.</i>

10:22.823 --> 10:24.522
Oh, Harry, give it to me!

10:24.524 --> 10:26.625
Oh! Give it to me! Don't stop!

10:26.627 --> 10:28.727
Oh! Oh, don't stop!
Don't stop!

10:28.729 --> 10:30.562
Oh, don't stop!

10:30.564 --> 10:35.133
Oh!

10:39.439 --> 10:41.906
Hey, you wanna smoke some weed?

10:41.908 --> 10:44.809
No. You talk too much
when you smoke.

10:50.083 --> 10:53.251
- Harry, do you love me?
- What?

10:53.253 --> 10:56.688
- What kind of question is that?
- Well, do you?

10:56.690 --> 10:59.924
Let's go to bed.
You're acting silly.

11:10.270 --> 11:12.904
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

11:15.375 --> 11:18.376
Oh. Okay.

11:18.378 --> 11:21.646
- That's it?
- What?

11:21.648 --> 11:24.382
I tell you I'm leaving,
and you don't try to stop me

11:24.384 --> 11:27.385
or ask me where I'm going?

11:27.387 --> 11:29.187
Where are you going?

11:29.189 --> 11:31.089
Can't believe I tried
to make this work, okay?

11:31.091 --> 11:33.725
You're stupid and immature
and selfish,

11:33.727 --> 11:36.628
and I can't do this anymore.

11:36.630 --> 11:38.797
That-- That's it?

11:38.799 --> 11:41.499
Yes, Harry, that's it!

11:41.501 --> 11:42.667
- Oh.
- Leaving you.

11:42.669 --> 11:44.869
If that's what you want.

11:48.442 --> 11:51.843
<i>Well, I guess</i>
<i> she made the decision.</i>

11:51.845 --> 11:54.446
<i> I could run after her.</i>

12:04.324 --> 12:06.324
Looks good.

12:09.296 --> 12:11.463
What are these scratches
right there?

12:11.465 --> 12:12.797
Those? Uh...

12:12.799 --> 12:14.699
- From my dog.
- You have a dog?

12:14.701 --> 12:17.135
Yeah, yeah, he's ferocious.

12:17.137 --> 12:20.739
Yeah, he's sleeping.

12:20.741 --> 12:23.174
All right, bro,
I'll take it.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.748
Uh, let's go this way.
Come on.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.916
Hey, so what kind of dog
do you have anyway?

12:31.918 --> 12:33.318
These are pretty deep
scratches.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.520
It's a cock-a-doodle poodle
Spaniard thing.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.822
I got a dog too, you know.
It's a West Highland Terrier.

12:37.824 --> 12:39.390
They're really cute, you know.

12:39.392 --> 12:41.659
Actually, he's really good
with aggressive dogs.

12:41.661 --> 12:43.094
Since you got
an aggressive, mean dog,

12:43.096 --> 12:45.530
- we could take 'em out.
- Thanks.

12:45.532 --> 12:48.800
Take them for a walk
to the park sometime, and...

12:48.802 --> 12:51.069
All right, bro,
I'll catch you later.

13:01.348 --> 13:04.249
Do you have the money
from the last one?

13:04.251 --> 13:06.551
- What?
- From the last job.

13:06.553 --> 13:07.952
Did you sell everything?

13:07.954 --> 13:09.521
Yeah. What kinda
fucking question is that?

13:09.523 --> 13:12.490
I'm just asking, man.
I wanna be done after today.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.993
You don't think
I'm gonna pay you?

13:14.995 --> 13:16.528
I didn't say that.

13:16.530 --> 13:17.729
I just don't wanna have
to ask for it later, man.

13:17.731 --> 13:19.030
It's awkward.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.165
For someone having
an awakening of morals,

13:20.167 --> 13:21.966
you sure are money hungry.

13:22.869 --> 13:24.836
You'll get your cash, okay?

13:24.838 --> 13:26.371
We'll just do this one today,

13:26.373 --> 13:29.107
and then you can
move on to your real job

13:29.109 --> 13:30.942
and start popping out
a shitload of kids

13:30.944 --> 13:32.677
or whatever it is you want.

13:32.679 --> 13:35.380
And I've never seen anyone
so fucking excited

13:35.382 --> 13:37.315
to sit at a desk.

13:48.695 --> 13:50.161
Dude, stop sleeping, man.

13:50.163 --> 13:53.097
Not sleeping.
Just resting my eyes.

13:57.537 --> 13:58.870
Hey.

13:58.872 --> 14:00.538
Look.

14:04.911 --> 14:07.245
Too easy.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.683
Must be hard trying to
figure out which car to take.

14:11.685 --> 14:13.651
Oh, honey,
let's take the sports car.

14:13.653 --> 14:15.086
Let's take the convertible.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.454
Oh, let's take
the convertible sports car.

14:16.456 --> 14:18.990
It's gonna be nice
this weekend.

14:23.263 --> 14:25.463
Oh, this dude's
definitely a sugar daddy.

14:25.465 --> 14:26.998
Yeah.

14:37.944 --> 14:39.244
Let's go.

14:39.246 --> 14:42.347
Wait. These people
always forget something.

14:50.323 --> 14:52.156
Dude, let's go, man.
I wanna get this shit over with.

14:52.158 --> 14:53.825
- I said wait.
- I wanna get this over with!

14:53.827 --> 14:55.393
Just wait.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.106
See? What'd I say?

15:08.108 --> 15:11.309
20 bucks says
it's a phone charger.

15:22.155 --> 15:24.289
- Jesus fuck.
- Called it.

15:24.291 --> 15:27.358
- You owe me 20 bucks.
- Fuck you.

15:59.659 --> 16:00.725
Come on.

16:13.506 --> 16:15.073
Fancy.

16:25.919 --> 16:28.186
What the fuck are you doing?

16:28.188 --> 16:30.388
Getting into
the holiday spirits.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.326
- Harry!
- What?

16:35.328 --> 16:37.161
What are you doing, man?
Come on.

16:37.163 --> 16:38.763
Chris, look around.

16:38.765 --> 16:42.367
I mean, this is the life, man.
That's your problem.

16:42.369 --> 16:46.104
You're always rushing around,
looking for the next best thing.

16:46.106 --> 16:49.407
Tell me that this is not better

16:49.409 --> 16:52.343
than your shitty
Tarzana apartment.

16:53.913 --> 16:55.013
Am I wrong?

16:55.015 --> 16:56.714
Yes!

16:56.716 --> 16:59.017
Not about that.

16:59.019 --> 17:00.551
Let's fucking go.

17:00.553 --> 17:03.321
No! I don't want it!
Come on!

17:04.124 --> 17:06.023
Yes, ma'am.

17:09.262 --> 17:10.528
Grab the electronics.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.763
I'll go upstairs
and check the bedrooms.

17:24.911 --> 17:27.310
<i> ¶¶</i>

17:29.816 --> 17:32.617

18:12.225 --> 18:13.391
What the hell?

18:13.393 --> 18:15.827
Hey! What the hell
is going on?

18:18.698 --> 18:21.632
Whoa-ho-ho-ho.

18:21.634 --> 18:22.967
Got you, you fuck.

18:22.969 --> 18:25.069
- Son of a bitch.
- Harry!

18:28.608 --> 18:29.740
- Harry!
- Harry?

18:29.742 --> 18:31.876
He's back!

18:31.878 --> 18:32.977
Come on.

18:32.979 --> 18:34.278
Hey, monkey!

18:37.484 --> 18:38.883
Huh?

18:42.255 --> 18:44.288
Harry! Get--

18:45.325 --> 18:47.625
Harry, get down here!

18:53.600 --> 18:54.665
Oh, fuck.

18:54.667 --> 18:55.800
Harry, go!

18:58.738 --> 19:01.506
Harry, Harry, Harry!

19:02.709 --> 19:04.308
Get the fuck off me!

19:04.310 --> 19:05.409
Get the fuck off!

19:07.814 --> 19:10.948
Keys, keys, your keys!
Gimme the keys!

19:24.864 --> 19:26.664
<i> Putain.</i>

19:36.543 --> 19:38.809
Holy shit!
Can you believe that?

19:38.811 --> 19:41.546
I mean, I've never seen 'em
come back twice.

19:41.548 --> 19:43.447
What are the fucking odds?

19:43.449 --> 19:45.283
- Do you think this is funny?
- What?

19:45.285 --> 19:46.717
No! My adrenaline is
just through the roof!

19:46.719 --> 19:49.620
I mean, I hit a guy
with a fucking water jug!

19:49.622 --> 19:51.289
This is fucking crazy.

19:51.291 --> 19:52.523
We almost got killed, Harry.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.058
- What?
- That guy wanted to
fucking kill me.

19:54.060 --> 19:55.092
He wasn't gonna kill you.

19:55.094 --> 19:57.395
Yes, he was! Are you insane?

19:57.397 --> 19:58.963
This is why I don't wanna
do this shit anymore.

19:58.965 --> 20:00.865
Hey, relax!
We're alive, aren't we?

20:00.867 --> 20:02.633
- We're here.
- I'm going.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.135
- Wait, wait wait.
- What, Harry?

20:04.137 --> 20:07.371
I got a job
in Toluca Lake tomorrow.

20:07.373 --> 20:08.839
You're kidding, right?

20:08.841 --> 20:11.409
- This some kinda fucking joke?
- Wait, wait, wait!

20:11.411 --> 20:13.211
It's a gold mine,
I swear to God.

20:13.213 --> 20:15.112
No!

20:15.114 --> 20:17.281
No! I'm done!

20:17.283 --> 20:18.916
Okay, I told you, man.

20:18.918 --> 20:20.351
I don't wanna risk my life

20:20.353 --> 20:22.987
for some fucking jewelry
and out-of-date laptops.

20:22.989 --> 20:25.489
Wait, wait, wait!
Don't you want your cash?

20:25.491 --> 20:27.225
No! You can keep it.

20:27.227 --> 20:29.327
- Wait!
- What?

20:29.329 --> 20:31.662
Are you coming to Grandma's
on Sunday?

20:33.233 --> 20:35.666
Yeah, I'll be there.

20:35.668 --> 20:38.102
Hey, if you close that door
there's no coming back.

20:39.872 --> 20:43.007
<i>They say you can't have</i>
<i>rainbows without a little rain.</i>

20:43.009 --> 20:44.709
<i>I think rainbows are overrated.</i>

20:44.711 --> 20:46.777
<i> - If I got to choose...</i>
- He'll be back.

20:46.779 --> 20:49.113

20:50.817 --> 20:51.916
<i> Leave a message</i>

20:51.918 --> 20:53.985

Hey, where are you?
The job's at noon.

20:58.157 --> 21:00.658
I'll text the address.

21:00.660 --> 21:03.661
Maybe I'll forgive you
for all the shit you said.

21:12.872 --> 21:15.006
<i>At the tone,</i>
<i> please record your message.</i>

21:16.075 --> 21:17.575
Chris, what the fuck?

21:17.577 --> 21:20.778
I mean, it's noon.
It's actually past noon.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.413
I'm starting to think you
were actually being serious

21:22.415 --> 21:26.050
about all the crazy shit
you were saying yesterday.

21:26.052 --> 21:30.454
Maybe you're on your way.
I'll wait a little bit longer.

21:54.681 --> 21:56.347
<i> At the tone,</i>
<i> please record your message.</i>

21:57.417 --> 21:59.350
Chris, you fucking blew it.

21:59.352 --> 22:00.885
I'm telling you,
you fucking blew it.

22:00.887 --> 22:03.421
I mean, don't even
think about showing up.

22:03.423 --> 22:05.389
8-7-8-9, 8-7-8-9.

22:05.391 --> 22:07.692
If I find a billion dollars
in a briefcase,

22:07.694 --> 22:10.661
I'm not fucking
sharing it with you.

22:10.663 --> 22:13.431
I mean, I don't even give a fuck
if we're cousins.

22:13.433 --> 22:14.865
You know what?
You know what else?

22:14.867 --> 22:17.501
<i> - To listen to your message...</i>
- Fuck you!

22:32.985 --> 22:34.118
Shit.

23:30.376 --> 23:31.742
Ah, crap.

23:44.824 --> 23:46.190
<i> ¶ A-one, two, three, four ¶</i>

Ah, fuck! Holy shit!

24:23.896 --> 24:26.864
- Oh, fuck me.
- Oh, hey.

24:31.504 --> 24:33.204
Are you okay?

24:33.206 --> 24:34.872
Mm-hmm.

24:34.874 --> 24:38.843
You know,
I'm robbing you right now.

24:38.845 --> 24:42.713
I basically just stole
all your shit.

24:42.715 --> 24:43.948
Yeah, that's cool.

24:43.950 --> 24:46.684
Can you close the door
on your way out?

24:46.686 --> 24:48.352
What are you doing?

24:48.354 --> 24:49.887
Waiting.

24:56.696 --> 24:59.396
Are you trying to kill yourself?

24:59.398 --> 25:00.598
Mm-hmm.

25:07.240 --> 25:10.307
Yeah, these are antibiotics.

25:10.309 --> 25:12.009
That's not gonna do it.

25:15.248 --> 25:17.047
Oh, motherfucker.

25:26.592 --> 25:29.026
Hydrocodone.
That'll do the trick.

25:29.028 --> 25:30.561
Thank you.

25:34.467 --> 25:37.134
Can you close the door
on your way out?

25:44.343 --> 25:45.643
The door!

26:04.530 --> 26:06.063
Crazy bitch.

26:12.038 --> 26:14.305
<i>So here I am again.</i>

26:14.307 --> 26:15.639
<i> Decision time.</i>

26:15.641 --> 26:17.207
<i> Save someone's life,</i>

26:17.209 --> 26:21.445

Hey!

26:29.989 --> 26:31.088
Come on.

26:31.090 --> 26:32.690
There you go.

26:32.692 --> 26:34.625
Oh, gross.

26:37.763 --> 26:41.098
<i>Should I stay</i>
<i> or should I go now?</i>

26:42.668 --> 26:45.302

28:04.483 --> 28:08.919
<i> ¶ With this parade</i>
<i> of renegades ¶</i>

28:45.491 --> 28:46.957
Morning, sunshine.

28:46.959 --> 28:49.259
Fuck, my head fucking kills.

28:49.261 --> 28:51.028
I'd offer you
some painkillers,

28:51.030 --> 28:53.797
but I think
you threw them all up.

28:57.169 --> 28:59.536
What are you still doing here?

28:59.538 --> 29:02.573
Are you making sure
I'll blow my brains out?

29:02.575 --> 29:04.475
You wouldn't do that.

29:04.477 --> 29:05.943
Why?

29:05.945 --> 29:09.580
Well, women don't
generally do that.

29:09.582 --> 29:12.950
You know, you guys, like,
slit your wrists or take pills,

29:12.952 --> 29:15.452
so you look pretty
when you die.

29:15.454 --> 29:18.288
Men, they blow their brains out
and hang themselves.

29:18.290 --> 29:22.059
- They did a study on it.
- Fascinating.

29:26.966 --> 29:29.166
Did you dress me?

29:31.170 --> 29:32.503
Yes.

29:32.505 --> 29:35.239
It felt weird, staring at
a half-dead girl's tits.

29:41.714 --> 29:43.113
Oh, dear God.

29:43.115 --> 29:45.149
Are you actually
following me everywhere?

29:45.151 --> 29:47.017
Why didn't you just
call the cops and leave?

29:47.019 --> 29:48.485
Well, I was going to,

29:48.487 --> 29:50.487
but you said you'd
rat me out if I called.

29:50.489 --> 29:52.322
- I did?
- You did.

29:52.324 --> 29:54.224
So what's your plan then?

29:54.226 --> 29:56.960
You know, you can't just
babysit me forever.

29:56.962 --> 30:00.697
You say that like you think
I actually have a plan.

30:00.699 --> 30:04.902
So, I mean, why do you wanna
kill yourself anyways?

30:04.904 --> 30:08.105
- You're joking, right?
- Never mind.

30:08.107 --> 30:11.341
You think I'm gonna have a
heart-to-heart with you now?

30:11.343 --> 30:13.343
I said never mind.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.615
<i> At the tone,</i>
<i> please record your message.</i>

30:24.623 --> 30:26.990
- What is it?
- Nothing.

30:35.668 --> 30:37.668
Want me to turn that on
for you?

30:37.670 --> 30:39.002
Nope.

30:39.004 --> 30:41.238
You just wanna stare
at a blank screen?

30:41.240 --> 30:42.239
Mm-hmm.

30:46.312 --> 30:48.645
- Oh, my God.
- Are you hungry?

30:48.647 --> 30:50.247
I mean, do you need to eat?

30:50.249 --> 30:52.182
I don't know what the protocol
is after almost dying.

30:52.184 --> 30:54.918
- Are you supposed to eat?
- I couldn't tell you.

30:54.920 --> 30:56.420
You know what?
Let's look it up.

30:56.422 --> 30:58.989
- Good.
- Mm-hmm.

30:58.991 --> 31:00.958
How do you even word that?

31:02.261 --> 31:04.595
Is it okay to eat
after almost dying?

31:04.597 --> 31:06.230
<i>I do not need</i>
<i> to eat anything.</i>

31:06.232 --> 31:08.365
<i> I am only here to serve.</i>

31:08.367 --> 31:09.933
Should I look up food
and OD-ing?

31:09.935 --> 31:11.368
That's what I'll do.

31:12.538 --> 31:13.737
What are you supposed to eat

31:13.739 --> 31:15.772
after almost OD-ing
on painkillers?

31:15.774 --> 31:17.608
<i>You should probably</i>
<i> go to the hospital.</i>

31:17.610 --> 31:21.612
Oh, my God, I'll eat.
Just stop talking, both of you.

31:24.216 --> 31:27.484
- Pasta?
- Don't care.

31:27.486 --> 31:29.519
- Eggs?
- Whatever.

31:31.357 --> 31:33.357
Half a sandwich?

31:33.359 --> 31:34.658
Eww.

31:34.660 --> 31:36.793
Mmm.

31:36.795 --> 31:39.296
Uh, let's go eggs.

31:40.699 --> 31:42.599
Breakfast for dinner.

31:43.702 --> 31:45.202
Where are your pans?

31:47.573 --> 31:49.339
You're a lot of help.

31:50.976 --> 31:52.709
Oh, there we go.

31:52.711 --> 31:55.879
I take it your boyfriend does
most of the cooking around here.

31:55.881 --> 31:57.314
What?

31:57.316 --> 31:59.316
The guy who lives here,
is he not your boyfriend?

31:59.318 --> 32:02.753
I mean, all the preppy attire
in the closet.

32:02.755 --> 32:04.554
Oh.

32:04.556 --> 32:09.226
Yeah, no, we're not
together anymore.

32:09.228 --> 32:10.861
Really?

32:10.863 --> 32:12.062
That was fast.

32:12.064 --> 32:13.530
What was fast?

32:13.532 --> 32:15.866
Saw him here
a couple days ago.

32:15.868 --> 32:19.236
I don't pick places at random.
I scope 'em out.

32:19.238 --> 32:24.041
Make sure there's no gun owners
or mean doggies.

32:24.043 --> 32:25.742
I don't wanna get myself killed.

32:25.744 --> 32:27.044
How thoughtful of you.

32:27.046 --> 32:28.679
I mean, that guy?

32:28.681 --> 32:31.448
He drives a Prius and drinks
green smoothies for breakfast.

32:31.450 --> 32:34.351
Definitely not a gun owner,
am I right?

32:34.353 --> 32:35.953
You are.

32:35.955 --> 32:37.554
Where are your knives
and forks?

32:37.556 --> 32:38.956
I don't know.

32:38.958 --> 32:41.024
Again, no help.

32:43.829 --> 32:45.162
So?

32:46.632 --> 32:48.765
So what?

32:48.767 --> 32:49.900
So when did it happen?

32:49.902 --> 32:51.435
Jesus Christ, dude.

32:51.437 --> 32:54.237
You ask more questions
than my fucking therapist.

32:54.239 --> 32:57.374
You have a therapist?
You should get your money back.

32:57.376 --> 32:59.576
Ha ha.

33:01.747 --> 33:03.413
It happened this morning.

33:04.450 --> 33:05.549
Shit.

33:05.551 --> 33:08.585
Yeah, we were engaged.

33:08.587 --> 33:11.421
Double shit. I'm sorry.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.733
That's a lot of salt.

33:22.735 --> 33:23.900
What?

33:23.902 --> 33:26.236
Do you always use
that much salt?

33:26.238 --> 33:27.871
Yeah. Salt makes everything
taste better.

33:27.873 --> 33:29.339
Well, it's not good for you.

33:29.341 --> 33:31.408
Why? It's natural.
It's from the earth.

33:31.410 --> 33:32.776
Why wouldn't it
be good for you?

33:32.778 --> 33:34.444
It's just not.

33:34.446 --> 33:36.580
For someone who tried to kill
themselves a couple hours ago,

33:36.582 --> 33:39.816
you sure are worried
about your sodium intake.

33:39.818 --> 33:43.320
Who would wanna kill themselves
when salt and butter exist?

33:43.322 --> 33:47.224
I mean, these right here
are two reasons to live.

33:49.294 --> 33:51.495
You're a hoot and a half.

33:59.371 --> 34:00.771
Ah!

34:04.443 --> 34:06.710
<i> At the tone,</i>
<i> please record your message.</i>

34:07.946 --> 34:09.713
Are you fucking kidding me?

34:09.715 --> 34:11.181
Answer your phone, Peter!

34:11.183 --> 34:14.751
Be a fucking man
and answer your goddamn phone!

34:14.753 --> 34:16.152
Asshole.

34:18.757 --> 34:20.991
Oh, my God.

34:20.993 --> 34:22.726
You okay?

34:24.329 --> 34:27.030
You wanna get high?

34:27.032 --> 34:28.165
Yes, please.

34:28.167 --> 34:30.534
I mean...

34:30.536 --> 34:32.402
the guy actually thinks
he's gonna be happy

34:32.404 --> 34:33.969
working at a temp job.

34:33.972 --> 34:35.572
Yeah, fucking right.

34:35.574 --> 34:37.974
I mean, who's ever happy
at a temp job?

34:37.976 --> 34:39.443
No one.

34:39.445 --> 34:42.612
Who's ever happy ever,
you know?

34:46.217 --> 34:49.453
I mean, it just doesn't
make sense to me.

34:49.455 --> 34:50.719
He has all this knowledge.

34:50.722 --> 34:53.190
He knows shit about shit,
you know?

34:53.192 --> 34:56.293
He even knows about fishes.

34:56.295 --> 34:58.328
I mean, not just fishes.

34:58.330 --> 35:00.630
He knows about everything.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.400
What?

35:03.402 --> 35:04.501
Fish.

35:04.503 --> 35:06.703
- "Fish" is already plural.
- Fishes.

35:06.705 --> 35:08.705
"Fishes,"
I don't think that's a word.

35:08.707 --> 35:11.074
You're so high.

35:11.076 --> 35:12.976
What? Just a little.

35:12.978 --> 35:15.378
You're really stoned.

35:15.380 --> 35:17.347
It's okay.
Don't get weird about it.

35:17.349 --> 35:20.917
I'm high too.
Self-medication is key, bruh.

35:24.990 --> 35:28.825
- Hey, I got a question.
- Hmm?

35:28.827 --> 35:30.994
Why the bathtub?

35:30.996 --> 35:32.529
What?

35:32.531 --> 35:35.499
Why kill yourself
in the bathtub?

35:35.501 --> 35:37.501
I just figured
if the pills didn't take,

35:37.503 --> 35:39.436
you know, maybe I'd drown.

35:39.438 --> 35:42.706
There's a pool right here.

35:44.476 --> 35:45.876
Oh.

35:45.878 --> 35:47.878
I didn't think about it.

35:50.749 --> 35:52.549
My mistake.

35:55.721 --> 35:56.953
Fishers.

35:56.955 --> 35:59.723
Fishers.
Fishermen.

35:59.725 --> 36:01.925
Fishies.

36:01.927 --> 36:02.993
Fisheesh--

36:02.995 --> 36:04.327
- Facetious.
- "Fa-she-sess."

36:04.329 --> 36:06.296
- It's facetious.
- "Fa-she-sess."

36:06.298 --> 36:08.932
- Is that right?
- No, it's totally not right.

36:08.934 --> 36:11.535
I mean, I wouldn't say I have a
horrible relationship with her,

36:11.537 --> 36:13.403
but it's definitely not
healthy-healthy,

36:13.405 --> 36:15.605
and she's my mom,
and I love her,

36:15.607 --> 36:17.240
but sometimes I just wanna
throw her in a home.

36:17.242 --> 36:18.575
Oh, God, amen.

36:18.577 --> 36:20.377
I mean, people always
make you feel bad,

36:20.379 --> 36:22.712
like your mom
gave birth to you,

36:22.714 --> 36:24.080
and it's like
I'm 30 years old.

36:24.082 --> 36:26.183
I didn't realize
that being born,

36:26.185 --> 36:28.685
you have to be eternally
in debt to someone.

36:30.189 --> 36:32.556
Oh, my God. I can't--

36:32.558 --> 36:34.691
I can't pee
with you standing here.

36:34.693 --> 36:37.794
- Why?
- 'Cause I'm like pee shy,

36:37.796 --> 36:38.962
and I'm freaked out.

36:38.964 --> 36:41.097
It's just freaking me out
right now.

36:41.099 --> 36:42.499
Well, I don't like it either,

36:42.501 --> 36:45.402
but we both know
you can't be trusted alone.

36:45.404 --> 36:47.337
Can you make water sounds?

36:47.339 --> 36:48.939
- Water sounds?
- Yeah.

36:48.941 --> 36:52.075
- Just turn the faucet on.
- No, no, just make the noise.

36:52.077 --> 36:54.277
Just make the noise.

36:55.814 --> 36:57.514
Yeah.

36:57.516 --> 37:01.585
Ah, okay, thank you.

37:03.422 --> 37:05.589
What was I talking about?

37:05.591 --> 37:08.491
I don't know.
Something about your mom.

37:08.493 --> 37:11.328
Uh, for giving birth to you?

37:11.330 --> 37:13.230
- No.
- Oh.

37:14.566 --> 37:16.433
Why is it always
the smallest girl

37:16.435 --> 37:18.101
who survives in these movies?

37:18.103 --> 37:21.037
- What do you mean?
- It's always the skinny girl

37:21.039 --> 37:24.207
who's, like, disheveled,
but not actually disheveled,

37:24.209 --> 37:25.976
like day two of Coachella
disheveled,

37:25.978 --> 37:27.611
and then the bad guy's
always like,

37:27.613 --> 37:30.580
"Can't grab tiny ankles
with giant hands."

37:30.582 --> 37:33.416
It's like her ankles are covered
in grease or something.

37:33.418 --> 37:34.751
Yeah, you're right.

37:34.753 --> 37:37.887
Like this girl. Watch.
Come here.

37:37.889 --> 37:39.556
Look, he's grabbing her,
grabbing.

37:39.558 --> 37:41.258
She's like, "Let me go!"

37:41.260 --> 37:42.792
Bam! She escapes.

37:42.794 --> 37:46.062
Holy shit. That's so true.

37:46.064 --> 37:47.998
Greased ankles.

37:49.301 --> 37:52.602
It's annoying

37:52.604 --> 37:54.804
and offensive
to everyone else.

37:54.806 --> 37:58.341
<i> ¶¶</i>

38:13.091 --> 38:16.293
<i> ¶¶</i>

38:30.242 --> 38:31.841
You texting him?

38:34.212 --> 38:35.412
Are you?

38:38.250 --> 38:40.517
It's not your business.

38:40.519 --> 38:42.118
Don't text him.

38:42.120 --> 38:44.587
Gosh, I don't why you think
I'm gonna listen to you.

38:44.589 --> 38:46.489
Well, I just figured
if I keep saying shit,

38:46.491 --> 38:48.591
maybe something will stick.

38:51.730 --> 38:56.366
I mean, honestly, what--
what is your plan here?

38:56.368 --> 38:57.600
What?

38:57.602 --> 38:59.903
I'm gonna kill myself, Harry.

38:59.905 --> 39:02.205
I am, whether it be
tonight or tomorrow

39:02.207 --> 39:04.374
or the day after that,
it's gonna happen.

39:04.376 --> 39:06.409
And you can ramble at me
all you want,

39:06.411 --> 39:07.777
and you can watch me
like a hawk,

39:07.779 --> 39:09.512
but it's not gonna
change anything.

39:09.514 --> 39:11.581
I don't wanna be here.
Why don't you get that?

39:11.583 --> 39:13.583
- That's not true.
- It is true!

39:13.585 --> 39:16.052
It is, and it's selfish of you
to make me stay.

39:16.054 --> 39:17.854
I guess I'm selfish then.

39:19.991 --> 39:21.991
Oh, my God.

39:23.328 --> 39:24.894
Stop following me!

39:24.896 --> 39:26.896
I just don't understand
why anyone would wanna die.

39:26.898 --> 39:30.100
Well, you know what?
It's not for you to understand.

39:33.338 --> 39:34.904
Shit.

39:39.511 --> 39:41.044
I don't know
why you care so much.

39:41.046 --> 39:42.412
You don't even know me.

39:42.414 --> 39:45.348
I know.
I mean, I don't know either.

39:45.350 --> 39:46.783
Look, I'm gonna do it, okay?

39:46.785 --> 39:48.451
And there's nothing
that you can do or say

39:48.453 --> 39:49.986
that's gonna stop it
from happening.

39:49.988 --> 39:52.789
Just stop making it
so fucking difficult.

39:52.791 --> 39:55.291
- I just think--
- Please just stop!

39:55.293 --> 39:56.593
Please.

39:56.595 --> 39:58.094
Fine. I mean,
if that's what you want.

39:58.096 --> 39:59.963
It is what I want.

40:03.034 --> 40:04.734
One condition.

40:04.736 --> 40:06.102
You need a last meal.

40:06.104 --> 40:08.271
- What?
- A last meal.

40:08.273 --> 40:10.507
Go big or go home.

40:10.509 --> 40:11.908
Wait. You are home.

40:11.910 --> 40:13.910
Look, even prisoners
get a last meal.

40:13.912 --> 40:15.378
You need one.

40:15.380 --> 40:17.113
God, what is your deal
with food?

40:17.115 --> 40:19.282
Dude, you're like obsessed
or something.

40:19.284 --> 40:20.917
I'm pretty sure
you're the only person on Earth

40:20.919 --> 40:23.219
who isn't obsessed with food.

40:23.221 --> 40:25.054
Look, I'll cook for you,

40:25.056 --> 40:27.824
and if you still wanna
kill yourself after, I'll leave.

40:27.826 --> 40:29.292
Deal?

40:29.294 --> 40:32.762
Is this like you asking me out
in some weird, fucked-up way?

40:32.764 --> 40:34.397
- What?
- I don't know.

40:34.399 --> 40:36.666
It just feels like you're
cooking me dinner and stuff.

40:36.668 --> 40:38.501
- It's kind of...
- No, it's like you said.

40:38.503 --> 40:40.403
- The food obsession thing.
- Okay.

40:40.405 --> 40:41.771
Come on.

40:43.175 --> 40:44.941
So all I have to do is eat.
That's it?

40:44.943 --> 40:46.810
- That's it.
- And then you'll go away,

40:46.812 --> 40:48.144
and you'll let me die in peace.

40:48.146 --> 40:49.379
Yes.

40:49.381 --> 40:51.014
God, fine.

40:51.016 --> 40:52.782
But make it super fancy.

40:52.784 --> 40:55.418
Is filet mignon
fancy enough for you?

40:55.420 --> 40:57.187
Yeah. Peter's a vegetarian,

40:57.189 --> 41:00.156
so good luck finding that
in this house.

41:00.158 --> 41:01.591
Figures.

41:04.129 --> 41:05.295
Come on, I have an idea.

41:05.297 --> 41:06.729
- No.
- Come on.

41:06.731 --> 41:08.798
- Come on.
- Oh, God.

41:13.438 --> 41:15.505
- No.
- Why? If you die,

41:15.507 --> 41:18.441
I'll just be doing you
a favor, right?

41:21.379 --> 41:25.915
<i> ¶¶</i>

41:29.855 --> 41:32.822
- You're going too fast.
- You're welcome.

41:32.824 --> 41:35.492
<i> ¶ I've been down</i>
<i> and out of luck ¶</i>

41:35.494 --> 41:37.260
<i> ¶ Most of my days ¶</i>

41:37.262 --> 41:40.463
<i> ¶ Spent all my innocence</i>

41:40.465 --> 41:42.632

41:46.938 --> 41:49.906

41:54.779 --> 41:56.646
<i> ¶ Yeah ¶</i>

42:02.187 --> 42:05.388
Hey, so how often
do you have to feed fish?

42:05.390 --> 42:07.257
What, like in the ocean?

42:07.259 --> 42:10.126
- No, like a pet fish.
- I don't know.

42:10.128 --> 42:14.163
I mean, I think people feed them
pretty much like every day.

42:14.165 --> 42:15.231
Really?

42:15.233 --> 42:17.734
I think so. I don't know.

42:18.937 --> 42:20.603
Daisy?

42:20.605 --> 42:23.573
Oh, my goodness!
I thought it was you!

42:23.575 --> 42:25.742
Anna, hey, yeah.

42:25.744 --> 42:27.343
How you doing?
You okay?

42:27.345 --> 42:29.679
- Yeah, I'm good.
- You remember Michael?

42:29.681 --> 42:31.648
- Good to see you.
- Yeah.

42:31.650 --> 42:33.216
Good to see you.

42:33.218 --> 42:34.851
Is this your new boyfriend?

42:34.853 --> 42:37.487
God, no.
No, that's Harry.

42:37.489 --> 42:39.022
He broke into my house

42:39.024 --> 42:40.790
and now he's apparently
kidnapping me.

42:40.792 --> 42:43.793
Oh, honey,
you've always been so funny.

42:43.795 --> 42:45.762
How you doing though?
You okay?

42:45.764 --> 42:47.430
- Yeah, I'm good.
- Yeah? You sure?

42:47.432 --> 42:48.565
Yes! Jesus!

42:48.567 --> 42:50.600
We should do coffee sometime.

42:50.602 --> 42:53.002
Okay? You still have
the same number?

42:53.004 --> 42:55.672
- We gotta go. Yeah.
- I'll text you.

42:55.674 --> 42:58.074
I'm so sorry
about you and Peter.

43:00.745 --> 43:05.014
<i> ¶¶</i>

43:36.548 --> 43:38.147
You okay?

43:39.951 --> 43:42.118
- You ask me that too much.
- I do?

43:42.120 --> 43:44.320
Yeah. It's a dumb question.

43:44.322 --> 43:45.788
Fair enough.

43:49.060 --> 43:51.928
You're a fucking coward, Pete!
I hate you!

43:51.930 --> 43:53.429
God, I fucking hate you!

43:53.431 --> 43:57.066
Don't you ever think about
calling me again, okay?

44:06.778 --> 44:10.146
Hey, I'm sorry, okay?
I'm upset.

44:10.148 --> 44:13.116
I really need to talk to you,
so please call me.

44:13.118 --> 44:14.350
Please.

44:22.060 --> 44:23.426
Don't.

44:23.428 --> 44:24.594
I didn't say anything.

44:24.596 --> 44:26.262
Dinner at seven.

44:27.165 --> 44:29.966
Is that what you're wearing?

44:34.472 --> 44:35.571
What's wrong with this?

44:35.573 --> 44:37.774
Nothing.

44:37.776 --> 44:39.442
Is there something wrong
with what I'm wearing?

44:39.444 --> 44:41.110
No, not at all.

44:41.112 --> 44:44.681
I just thought maybe you'd wanna
look better when you die.

44:46.551 --> 44:48.551
Am I supposed
to like dress up?

44:48.553 --> 44:50.286
You can do whatever you want.

44:50.288 --> 44:52.221
It's not my last meal,
it's yours.

45:17.749 --> 45:20.516
Well, look what the pussycat
dragged in.

45:20.518 --> 45:22.118
<i>Look, hey, I got your messages.</i>

45:22.120 --> 45:24.020
- ¶¶
- I'm sorry, man.

45:24.022 --> 45:25.788
I just didn't want this
to end weirdly.

45:25.790 --> 45:26.856
<i> I'm sorry.</i>

45:26.858 --> 45:27.924
I can't hear you.

45:27.926 --> 45:29.125
I'm too busy rolling around

45:29.127 --> 45:31.127
in a giant pile
of hundred dollar bills.

45:31.129 --> 45:33.429
<i> That's good. I'm glad to hear.</i>

45:33.431 --> 45:36.733
<i> What's all that music?</i>
<i> You're having a party?</i>

45:36.735 --> 45:39.035
What? No, I'm working out.

45:39.037 --> 45:40.503
Oh, that's less exciting.

45:40.505 --> 45:41.804
<i> Gotta fit into the one suit</i>
<i> I have.</i>

45:41.806 --> 45:43.072
<i> You took the rest of 'em.</i>

45:43.074 --> 45:44.741
So I take it
you're not coming back.

45:44.743 --> 45:45.775
<i> Nah, man.</i>

45:45.777 --> 45:48.544
I'm not. I'm sorry.

45:48.546 --> 45:50.813
Your funeral.

45:50.815 --> 45:51.948
<i> Hey, listen.</i>

45:51.950 --> 45:55.585
<i> ¶¶</i>

45:55.587 --> 45:57.453
Thanks for everything, Har.

45:57.455 --> 45:58.788
It was really fun.

46:00.158 --> 46:02.892
Yeah.
Yeah, it was all right.

46:02.894 --> 46:04.594
<i> And I'll still see you</i>
<i> all the time.</i>

46:04.596 --> 46:07.964
You know, it's just not gonna
be running away from people

46:07.966 --> 46:09.098
trying to kill me.

46:09.100 --> 46:11.400
Yeah.

46:11.402 --> 46:13.669
Well, hey, man, have fun
at that fucking paper job

46:13.671 --> 46:15.138
or whatever the shit it is.

46:15.140 --> 46:16.973
<i> Try not to die of boredom.</i>

46:16.975 --> 46:19.375
- I'll try not to, man.
<i> - All right, man.</i>

46:19.377 --> 46:21.477
Listen, I gotta run.

46:21.479 --> 46:22.545
<i> Oh.</i>

46:22.547 --> 46:24.781
Okay. Uh...

46:24.783 --> 46:26.649

Grandma's thing, right?

46:26.651 --> 46:30.186
Yeah, man.
I'll see you then.

46:30.188 --> 46:32.889
- Bye, dude.
<i> - Later, man.</i>

¶¶

47:51.936 --> 47:54.270
Don't laugh, okay?

47:57.642 --> 47:59.542
Wow.

47:59.544 --> 48:01.510
Ugh.

48:01.512 --> 48:03.045
I look ridiculous.

48:03.047 --> 48:04.680
- No, no, you don't.
- I do.

48:04.682 --> 48:07.950
I look like one of those girls
in the movie they make over

48:07.952 --> 48:10.553
out of pity.

48:10.555 --> 48:12.688
No, you look...

48:12.690 --> 48:14.323
You look amazing.

48:16.861 --> 48:19.161
This is fancy, all right.

48:19.163 --> 48:22.231
You wanted fancy,
you get fancy.

48:22.233 --> 48:23.266
Please.

48:24.669 --> 48:26.569
Oh, thank you.

48:30.408 --> 48:31.974
What?

48:31.976 --> 48:34.777
Nothing.
This is just very datey.

48:34.779 --> 48:36.913
So what if it is?
Whatever.

48:36.915 --> 48:38.981
Nice suit.

48:38.983 --> 48:40.516
Oh, this old thing.

48:40.518 --> 48:43.286
Did you just find it
lying around?

48:43.288 --> 48:46.022
That's exactly
where I found it.

48:48.726 --> 48:49.959
Oh.

48:51.095 --> 48:53.562
- To you.
- To me?

48:53.564 --> 48:54.931
Yeah, this is your night.

48:54.933 --> 48:56.399
Please don't toast to me.

48:56.401 --> 48:57.800
Then what do you
wanna toast to then?

48:57.802 --> 49:00.002
Literally anything else.

49:02.273 --> 49:03.105
To me.

49:03.107 --> 49:05.007
God, that's even worse.

49:05.009 --> 49:06.409
Okay, to you.

49:06.411 --> 49:08.711
Harry Last-name-I-don't-know.

49:15.486 --> 49:16.752
Here goes nothing.

49:16.754 --> 49:19.255
- Good luck.
- Hah!

49:21.392 --> 49:23.125
- Oh, my God.
- It's good, huh?

49:23.127 --> 49:24.393
This is so good.

49:24.395 --> 49:26.095
I'll let you in
on a little secret.

49:26.097 --> 49:28.798
Salt. Fuckloads of it.

49:28.800 --> 49:30.967
Revolutionary.

49:33.371 --> 49:34.603
So...

49:34.605 --> 49:37.173
what are you gonna do
after you die?

49:37.175 --> 49:38.374
What do you mean?

49:38.376 --> 49:41.610
Like what's your first stop?

49:41.612 --> 49:42.878
After I die?

49:42.880 --> 49:44.180
Yeah.

49:44.182 --> 49:45.915
What, do you mean,
like, afterlife?

49:45.917 --> 49:47.683
Of course.

49:49.087 --> 49:50.987
Do you actually believe
in all that stuff?

49:52.690 --> 49:55.124
- What, like God?
- Yeah.

49:55.126 --> 49:57.526
I think so.
I mean, don't you?

49:57.528 --> 49:58.527
No.

50:00.832 --> 50:02.999
So what's the meaning
of all this then?

50:03.001 --> 50:04.600
See, I knew you were
gonna ask that.

50:04.602 --> 50:06.035
Well?

50:06.037 --> 50:08.371
The question doesn't
make any sense.

50:08.373 --> 50:09.638
Why?

50:09.640 --> 50:12.541
The question should be,
"How did we come to exist?"

50:12.543 --> 50:14.343
Or, "What can we do
while we're here?"

50:14.345 --> 50:16.979
To ask why we're here,
it's idiotic.

50:16.981 --> 50:19.048
- There's no reason.
- No reason?

50:19.050 --> 50:22.618
No. Humans spend
their entire life wondering,

50:22.620 --> 50:23.953
"Why are we here?"

50:23.955 --> 50:25.788
when in actuality,
we're just a bunch of monkeys

50:25.790 --> 50:27.390
running around on a rock,

50:27.392 --> 50:30.826
trying to have sex with each
other and not get blown up.

50:30.828 --> 50:32.862
So you don't think anything
happens after you die?

50:32.864 --> 50:34.864
No, it does.

50:34.866 --> 50:37.299
It just doesn't involve me.

50:37.301 --> 50:38.667
With an attitude like that,

50:38.669 --> 50:41.504
I know why you wouldn't
wanna stay alive.

50:41.506 --> 50:43.339
Hilarious.

50:43.341 --> 50:46.108
So if you're an atheist,
I mean, why do you wanna die?

50:46.110 --> 50:47.643
What's the difference?

50:47.645 --> 50:50.780
Like most people, they get
something after all this.

50:50.782 --> 50:53.015
As far as you're concerned,
this is it.

50:53.017 --> 50:58.287
Why would you wanna give up
the one thing you'll ever have?

50:58.289 --> 51:01.257
I just don't think
it's all that great.

51:03.294 --> 51:04.994
So will you tell me why then?

51:04.996 --> 51:06.896
Tell you what?

51:06.898 --> 51:09.098
Why you wanna do it.

51:09.100 --> 51:11.834
Why do you need to know
so badly?

51:11.836 --> 51:14.003
I don't know.

51:14.005 --> 51:17.640
I guess I just want to.

51:17.642 --> 51:20.209
<i> ¶¶</i>

51:22.447 --> 51:24.580
I don't know how to explain it.

Try.

51:34.292 --> 51:37.293
Okay.

51:37.295 --> 51:39.695
You know, there's like
those moments in life

51:39.697 --> 51:43.399
that you'll always remember
because you were so, so happy

51:43.401 --> 51:46.035
you couldn't forget it
if you tried?

51:46.037 --> 51:47.603
Yeah.

51:49.841 --> 51:51.740
I've never had one of those.

51:51.742 --> 51:53.375
I've never felt that.

51:53.377 --> 51:54.877
What about when you were a kid?

51:54.879 --> 51:57.313
I mean, I smiled.

51:57.315 --> 52:01.250
I went through the motions.
I looked happy.

52:01.252 --> 52:04.720
But... nothing on the inside.

52:06.858 --> 52:08.124
Wait here.

52:18.769 --> 52:21.137
<i> ¶¶</i>

52:22.740 --> 52:28.144
You know, when I was a kid,
and I'd get sad,

52:28.146 --> 52:32.181
my mom would throw on a record
and make me dance with her.

52:32.183 --> 52:33.782

I don't know.
It's your record.

52:55.173 --> 52:57.039
How do you feel right now?

52:57.041 --> 52:59.041
Right now?

52:59.043 --> 53:01.911
You still feel shitty?

53:01.913 --> 53:03.646
I feel...

53:03.648 --> 53:05.881
less shitty.

53:05.883 --> 53:07.883
Less shitty is good.

You asshole!

54:17.321 --> 54:19.321
Oh, I knew it.

54:19.323 --> 54:21.056
I knew it.

54:21.058 --> 54:23.058

What?

54:47.752 --> 54:49.685
Officers.

54:49.687 --> 54:51.720
Sir, we've received
a noise complaint

54:51.722 --> 54:53.856
from some of your neighbors.

54:53.858 --> 54:55.357
Yelling, loud music.

54:55.359 --> 54:58.260
Yeah, I just, uh...

54:58.262 --> 54:59.995
Sir, is everything okay?

54:59.997 --> 55:01.930
Yeah, everything...

55:01.932 --> 55:05.434
I also noticed some spray paint
on the sensor on your gate.

55:05.436 --> 55:08.437
Looks like it
may have been forced open.

55:08.439 --> 55:10.472
We've been meaning to fix it.

55:10.474 --> 55:12.007
Is there someone there with you?

55:16.047 --> 55:18.414
Yeah, there's someone here.

55:18.416 --> 55:20.949
Honey, is everything okay?

55:20.951 --> 55:23.152
Ma'am, there's been
a noise complaint.

55:23.154 --> 55:25.788
Oh, my God.
I am so sorry.

55:25.790 --> 55:28.023
You know what?
It is our one-year anniversary.

55:28.025 --> 55:32.094
We got a little carried away
with the wine and the music.

55:32.096 --> 55:33.662
I promise we'll keep it down.

55:33.664 --> 55:35.464
I know you guys
are just doing your job,

55:35.466 --> 55:37.666
and I really appreciate--
we really appreciate--

55:37.668 --> 55:40.502
you coming out
and letting us know.

55:43.407 --> 55:45.974
You know...

55:45.976 --> 55:49.578
some of the neighbors around
here are a little uptight,

55:49.580 --> 55:52.047
so we appreciate
your understanding.

55:52.049 --> 55:53.749
- I know, I know.
- Yeah.

55:53.751 --> 55:55.617
- Thank you, guys.
- Thank you.

55:55.619 --> 55:57.152
And please be safe tonight.

55:57.154 --> 55:58.153
- All right.
- All right.

55:58.155 --> 55:59.254
Happy anniversary, guys.

55:59.256 --> 56:00.923
Thank you, thank you.

56:03.327 --> 56:05.461
Holy shit!
Did you see their faces?

56:05.463 --> 56:07.029
I mean, I froze.

56:07.031 --> 56:09.798
How did you do that?

56:09.800 --> 56:13.102
You know this doesn't
change anything, don't you?

56:14.271 --> 56:15.504
Doesn't it?

56:18.709 --> 56:20.109
No.

56:23.614 --> 56:25.280
I think you're wrong.

56:25.282 --> 56:27.216
- Harry...
- I do, I do.

56:27.218 --> 56:28.584
I think you're making a mistake.

56:28.586 --> 56:31.353
I think you could be happy.

56:31.355 --> 56:32.921
Jesus Christ!

56:32.923 --> 56:35.557
You told me all I had to do
was have dinner with you!

56:35.559 --> 56:36.725
You said that was it!

56:36.727 --> 56:38.227
Yeah, well, I changed my mind.

56:38.229 --> 56:39.862
- You changed your mind?
- Yes!

56:39.864 --> 56:41.597
- It doesn't work like that!
- Why not?

56:41.599 --> 56:43.832
Because this is my life, Harry!

56:43.834 --> 56:45.934
And I decide if I fucking
wanna be a part of it or not!

56:45.936 --> 56:47.636
Well, I don't think
you wanna do this!

56:47.638 --> 56:50.706
Well, I don't think you
fucking know me at all!

56:56.981 --> 56:58.781
Peter!

56:58.783 --> 57:02.151
No, I'm sorry.
Please don't yell.

57:02.153 --> 57:05.053

What are you doing?

Why are you leaving?

58:03.414 --> 58:05.247
Just because
you wanna kill yourself

58:05.249 --> 58:07.382
doesn't mean you should jump
in front of someone else's car.

58:07.384 --> 58:09.451
I don't want that on my
conscience the rest of my life.

58:09.453 --> 58:11.320

asked me to do.

58:16.026 --> 58:17.693
But why?
I don't understand.

58:17.695 --> 58:19.661
Are you actually this crazy?
You wanted me to go.

58:19.663 --> 58:21.430
What, do you want me to stay?

58:21.432 --> 58:24.199
No! No.

58:24.201 --> 58:26.201
What the fuck do you want?

58:26.203 --> 58:29.505
God, you're such

58:29.507 --> 58:32.207
I wanted to be dead!
That's what I fucking wanted!

You know earlier when I said
I've never really felt happy?

01:04:57.394 --> 01:05:01.663
I lied. I did.
I felt happy one time.

01:05:01.665 --> 01:05:05.100
When I was a kid, there was
this girl named Shelby,

01:05:05.102 --> 01:05:08.203
who used to get bullied
by these two asshole girls.

01:05:08.205 --> 01:05:10.005
And one day,
they were yelling at her

01:05:10.007 --> 01:05:13.241
and calling her names,
and so I ran over,

01:05:13.243 --> 01:05:15.410
and I grabbed them both
by their ponytails,

01:05:15.412 --> 01:05:17.679
and I shoved their faces
in the sand.

01:05:17.681 --> 01:05:20.415
And they ran away crying
and screaming for the teacher.

01:05:20.417 --> 01:05:22.417
That's what made you happy?

01:05:22.419 --> 01:05:24.386
- Yeah.
- That's fucked up.

01:05:24.388 --> 01:05:27.789

01:05:27.791 --> 01:05:29.691

01:05:29.693 --> 01:05:30.992
Not really, no.

01:05:30.994 --> 01:05:34.095
She ended up
ratting me out later.

01:05:34.097 --> 01:05:35.330
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:05:35.332 --> 01:05:36.798

What the fuck
you talking about, lady?

01:08:20.063 --> 01:08:21.229
Who are you?
This is my house.

01:08:21.231 --> 01:08:23.031
How'd you get in here?

01:08:23.033 --> 01:08:24.899
- Peter.
- This is Peter?

01:08:24.901 --> 01:08:27.202
Daisy?
What are you doing here?

01:08:27.203 --> 01:08:28.670
Peter, I'm sorry.

01:08:28.671 --> 01:08:30.205
Hey, look, you can't
just show up like this.

01:08:30.207 --> 01:08:32.173
We told you.
We could have you arrested.

01:08:32.175 --> 01:08:34.042
I know. I'm sorry.
I freaked out.

01:08:34.044 --> 01:08:35.376
I'm gonna call the police.

01:08:35.377 --> 01:08:37.078
Okay, what the fuck's going on?

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:39.981
I mean, first with
the voicemails and--

01:08:39.983 --> 01:08:41.683
What is this?

01:08:41.685 --> 01:08:44.652
Did she tell you
that she lives here?

01:08:44.654 --> 01:08:47.287
Oh, my God.
That is rich!

01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:50.225
This is like a new level
of insanity for you!

01:08:50.227 --> 01:08:51.826
Are those my lobster shorts?

01:08:51.828 --> 01:08:54.662
Don't touch me, Cynthia!
Don't you ever fucking touch me.

01:08:54.663 --> 01:08:56.331
Sweetheart, I think
you should get some help.

01:08:56.332 --> 01:08:59.033
- Back off.
- Baby, don't. She's crazy.

01:08:59.035 --> 01:09:02.237
What the fuck? Have you been
going through our mail?

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:04.372
- I can't believe this.
<i>- 911.</i>

01:09:04.374 --> 01:09:05.540
I'm calling to report
a home invasion.

01:09:05.542 --> 01:09:06.841
No one's calling
the cops, buddy.

01:09:06.843 --> 01:09:09.511
- The address is--
- Shut the fuck up.

01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:13.081
Daisy, you don't live here?

01:09:13.082 --> 01:09:14.515
I used to.

01:09:14.518 --> 01:09:16.917
No, that was over a year ago,
you psycho.

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:18.620
You belong in an institution.

01:09:18.622 --> 01:09:20.287
And then Peter
fucked my best friend,

01:09:20.290 --> 01:09:21.856
and here they are,
all pregnant and happy

01:09:21.858 --> 01:09:23.457
and living their perfect
little life together,

01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:25.393
like nothing fucking happened.

01:09:25.395 --> 01:09:27.495
- Her?
- Yes.

01:09:28.965 --> 01:09:30.532
I said I was sorry.

01:09:30.533 --> 01:09:32.734
That's not what happened
at all, okay? Look.

01:09:32.736 --> 01:09:34.935
You and I were never
gonna work because of you.

01:09:34.938 --> 01:09:36.371
Okay? Your mental issues.

01:09:36.372 --> 01:09:39.207
This has got nothing to do
with Cynthia and I.

01:09:39.209 --> 01:09:41.109
Hey, man, I don't know
who you are,

01:09:41.111 --> 01:09:43.978
but every guy deserves to know
that this girl is crazy.

01:09:43.979 --> 01:09:47.081
All right? She is not well,
she's dangerous, and...

01:09:47.082 --> 01:09:48.883
I suggest that you run,
all right?

01:09:48.885 --> 01:09:50.885
Run while you can. Trust me!

01:09:50.886 --> 01:09:52.220
Do you have a home phone?

01:09:52.221 --> 01:09:53.488
What?

01:09:53.490 --> 01:09:56.090
- Do you have a home phone?
- No.

01:09:56.092 --> 01:09:58.860
- Gimme your phone.
- No.

01:09:58.862 --> 01:10:00.662
Gimme your fucking cell!

01:10:00.664 --> 01:10:03.231
- It's okay, baby.
- Here's what's gonna happen.

01:10:03.233 --> 01:10:04.832
We're gonna leave,

01:10:04.834 --> 01:10:05.934
your wife's pregnant,

01:10:05.936 --> 01:10:07.602
and you drive a hybrid.

01:10:07.604 --> 01:10:09.437
Hey!

01:10:09.439 --> 01:10:11.839
So I don't think we're
gonna have any trouble.

01:10:11.841 --> 01:10:15.176
- Wait. You wanna say anything?
- What?

01:10:15.178 --> 01:10:16.811
Daisy, these people
ruined your life.

01:10:16.813 --> 01:10:19.480
Do you wanna
say anything to them?

01:10:21.284 --> 01:10:22.784
It's okay.

01:10:27.023 --> 01:10:29.190
Cynthia...

01:10:29.192 --> 01:10:31.292
I trusted you.
You were my best friend.

01:10:31.294 --> 01:10:33.094
I told you every little
thing in my life.

01:10:33.096 --> 01:10:36.497
I was there every time
you got your heart broken.

01:10:36.499 --> 01:10:38.833
I helped you get your clit ring
out when it was stuck, dude.

01:10:38.835 --> 01:10:42.537
I told you not to get that.
It was nasty and stupid.

01:10:42.539 --> 01:10:45.607
And, Peter,
you broke my heart, man.

01:10:45.609 --> 01:10:48.276
You ripped it into
a million fucking pieces,

01:10:48.278 --> 01:10:49.677
and I hate you for it, I do.

01:10:49.679 --> 01:10:51.879
I look at you,
and I feel physically ill,

01:10:51.881 --> 01:10:54.916
wondering how I ever
had sex with you.

01:10:54.918 --> 01:10:56.417
I don't love you.

01:10:56.419 --> 01:10:58.620
I fucking hate both of you.

01:10:58.622 --> 01:11:01.389
You know what?
Fuck you and fuck you!

01:11:01.391 --> 01:11:03.625
And fuck your stupid house,
okay?

01:11:03.627 --> 01:11:07.128
It's boring
and poorly decorated.

01:11:07.130 --> 01:11:09.163
And fuck your baby.

01:11:09.165 --> 01:11:11.599
I hope he comes out retarded.

01:11:11.601 --> 01:11:13.568
I don't think she meant
that last part.

01:11:17.574 --> 01:11:19.707
Ah! I hate this stupid house.

01:11:19.709 --> 01:11:22.410
No one even plays the piano!

01:11:29.185 --> 01:11:33.054
<i> ¶¶</i>

01:11:42.165 --> 01:11:45.166
I'm honestly not feeling
super-stoked about lying to you,

01:11:45.168 --> 01:11:47.101
so I'm sorry.

01:11:47.103 --> 01:11:50.305
I broke into their house too,
so I can't judge.

01:11:50.307 --> 01:11:54.108
I wonder who would win in
a who's more fucked-up contest.

01:11:54.110 --> 01:11:56.010
You, by a landslide.

01:11:56.012 --> 01:11:58.579
Yeah, no argument here.

01:11:59.482 --> 01:12:01.683
Welcome to my humble abode.

01:12:01.685 --> 01:12:02.817
Ah.

01:12:06.323 --> 01:12:08.856
Oh, my God.

01:12:08.858 --> 01:12:11.859
<i> ¶¶</i>

01:12:13.797 --> 01:12:16.364
People in this town
are fucking animals.

01:12:19.736 --> 01:12:22.003
Well, you hungry?
I'll make you breakfast.

01:12:22.005 --> 01:12:24.172
Why are you always
trying to feed me?

01:12:24.174 --> 01:12:26.474
I'll put extra salt in it.
You'll love it.

01:12:26.476 --> 01:12:27.909
<i>I guess in the end,</i>

01:12:27.911 --> 01:12:30.978
<i> life is just a summary</i>
<i> of choices you make,</i>

01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:33.548

<i> an opportunity to decide</i>

01:12:33.550 --> 01:12:35.750

01:12:38.788 --> 01:12:41.889

01:12:41.891 --> 01:12:45.159
<i> ¶ She's my favorite way</i>

01:12:45.161 --> 01:12:50.231
<i> ¶ I'm able to call her mine,</i>
<i> and I'm lucky to have her ¶</i>

01:12:50.233 --> 01:12:52.867

01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:58.473
