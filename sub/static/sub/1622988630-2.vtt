I didn't try to kill him.

10:51.276 --> 10:52.277

He said something about a comedy class.

-I don't keep his schedule.
-Comedy class?

10:56.281 --> 10:58.283
He didn't say anything
about a comedy class.

10:58.367 --> 10:59.910
I don't understand.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.079
I tried so hard
to make him feel welcome here.

11:02.162 --> 11:05.040
I gave him a desk, a nameplate, and look,

11:05.123 --> 11:08.126
he never even drank his Drooler Cooler.

It's my class, on comedy.
Before we get started,

11:16.385 --> 11:18.679
I'd like to say a few words
about my comedy journey.

11:18.762 --> 11:20.264

11:20.347 --> 11:22.599

11:22.683 --> 11:24.643
Yeah, can't happen soon enough.

11:24.726 --> 11:27.521

They stuck me down with the MIFT lunatics.

11:27.604 --> 11:29.022

11:43.912 --> 11:46.248
-You forgot your Drooler Cooler.
-And us.

11:46.331 --> 11:48.709
So, I insisted we all bring it to you.

11:48.792 --> 11:50.127
Aren't we lucky?

11:50.210 --> 11:52.379
Ah! More students. Hello! Take a seat.

11:52.462 --> 11:56.216
Hey, thanks!
So, when you say "take a seat,"

11:56.300 --> 11:58.552
does that mean I have to return it?

11:58.635 --> 12:00.262

actually punching somebody."

12:11.190 --> 12:13.358
I joined the improv group at MU,
Monsters of Comedy.

12:13.442 --> 12:14.526
-You were in it?
-Nope.

12:14.610 --> 12:16.153
They did this thing, "Yes, and..."

12:16.236 --> 12:17.738
where you have to say, "Yes, and..."

12:17.821 --> 12:20.157

and I said, "Yes, and..."

12:20.240 --> 12:23.202
"Hundred bucks?" "Yes, and..."
"Two hundred bucks?" "Yes, and..."

-It was a very expensive class.
-MIKE: That's it for me.
