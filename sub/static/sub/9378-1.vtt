00:56.603 --> 00:59.299
(man) That's me.

00:59.373 --> 01:02.342
That's my dad.

01:05.010 --> 01:07.673
I remember that day.

01:08.348 --> 01:11.146
And believe it or not, I remember that hit.

01:12.452 --> 01:15.888
I remember it because of the smile
that spread over my dad's face.

01:22.696 --> 01:26.598
Yeah, I'd have stood there all day
just to sink one.

01:26.666 --> 01:29.533
Just to see that smile.

01:30.270 --> 01:33.569
You see, to Pop, sports were a religion.

01:33.640 --> 01:36.734
To me, it was about purity.

01:36.810 --> 01:41.110
Sports was a place
where all wrongs could be made right.

01:41.181 --> 01:46.380
I thought if I filled the whole house
with trophies for him, he'd stick around.

01:46.453 --> 01:48.853
Well, I did.

01:48.922 --> 01:51.117
He left before my tenth birthday.

01:56.062 --> 01:59.361
(commentator) The Championship
has come down to this final play.

01:59.433 --> 02:02.527
The Sun Devils trail by four.
The ball on the Aztec 15.

02:02.602 --> 02:04.263
Seven seconds left on the clock.

02:04.337 --> 02:08.103
Settle it down.
Pro-right tiger. This is your game.

02:08.175 --> 02:11.770
Now, let's go. Let's go get 'em.
Now, let's go! Let's go!

02:11.845 --> 02:15.281
(referee) Sun Devils' ball.
First down and ten yards to go.

02:15.348 --> 02:18.146
Here we go, men, last play.
It's fun time!

02:18.218 --> 02:23.554
Pro-right tiger. Wide check. 532 double fly
on two, Scottie. Guaranteed TD.

02:23.623 --> 02:25.523
We gotta worry about one thing, men.

02:25.592 --> 02:28.891
After we win this game
they'll be putting cameras in your faces.

02:28.962 --> 02:31.726
Don't give them "Hi, Mom"s and shit.
It's overused.

02:31.798 --> 02:34.528
You gotta thank somebody, thank me.

02:34.601 --> 02:37.434
- I'll see you in the end zone, men. Ready?
- (all) Break!

02:38.038 --> 02:40.370
(man) I was a quarterback
since peewee football -

02:40.440 --> 02:44.968
set high-school records, won
state championships. This was perfect.

02:45.045 --> 02:47.570
Coming at you, 57.

02:47.647 --> 02:51.640
(man) Bowl game, national TV,
there were pro scouts in the stands,

02:51.718 --> 02:54.209
and I knew exactly
what was gonna happen next.

02:54.287 --> 02:58.053
(commentator) Lang has led the Sun
Devils to four comebacks this season.

02:58.124 --> 03:01.992
Can he do it?
Win their first bowl game in 12 years?

03:02.062 --> 03:06.658
Lang barks the signals. The Aztecs have
eight in the box. They're showing blitz.

03:06.733 --> 03:09.224
Lang takes the snap,
fades back into the pocket.

03:09.302 --> 03:12.169
He looks for Ravis on the right.
Sherman breaks through.

03:12.239 --> 03:15.299
Lang's in trouble. He shakes Sherman off,
nearly goes down.

03:15.375 --> 03:20.506
He's looking to throw. Two seconds to go.
There he goes. He's going to run it.

03:20.580 --> 03:23.981
He's got to get in the end zone.
And that safety is stepping up.

03:24.050 --> 03:26.416
Can he make it?

03:26.486 --> 03:27.919
(crunch)

03:27.988 --> 03:30.889
- (commentator) Touchdown!
- Argh!

03:30.957 --> 03:36.520
(Lang) My first thought was I could tape it
and play next week. Then I puked.

03:42.569 --> 03:46.232
When do I play again, Doc?
What's the rehab time?

03:46.306 --> 03:48.570
I'm not sure, son.

03:52.112 --> 03:54.512
(groans)

04:02.455 --> 04:04.946
(Lang) Football wasn't a sport.

04:05.025 --> 04:07.289
It was my life.

04:07.360 --> 04:10.022
And I wasn't gonna give up now.

04:10.096 --> 04:12.326
I would play again.

04:12.399 --> 04:16.767
In the meantime I needed ajob
to hold me over between tryouts.

04:16.836 --> 04:19.134
Then one day, and it didn't take long,

04:19.204 --> 04:22.697
six years had passed
and I woke up at the bottom.

04:22.776 --> 04:25.244
"You have reached
the Jessica Simpson hotline.

04:25.312 --> 04:28.304
"Jessica will tell you
about Nick's birthday party,

04:28.381 --> 04:32.078
"and a whole lot more about
her rocking new panty line at Wal-Mart.

04:32.152 --> 04:36.748
"But first here's a little fan trivia
to win a VIP gold-package backstage pass

04:36.823 --> 04:39.383
"to Jessica's Omnicon Hotel summer tour."

04:39.459 --> 04:41.825
- Lang.
- "The question..." I'm taping, boss.

04:41.895 --> 04:45.729
Look. I got a job for you. Bauer's sick.
I can't update his betting line.

04:45.799 --> 04:48.529
- You know anything about sports?
- Yeah, a little.

04:48.602 --> 04:53.699
(Lang) 900 numbers, audio text.
The racket had a lot of names.

04:53.773 --> 04:58.870
This guy's gig was sports handicapping -
predicting winners for people who bet.

04:58.945 --> 05:01.573
I was supposed tojust record his picks.

05:01.648 --> 05:04.617
Thing was, I didn't agree with them.

05:04.684 --> 05:06.584
No, they're not.

05:07.954 --> 05:13.017
Living in Las Vegas, it was easy to gauge
the temperature of the betting public.

05:13.093 --> 05:15.425
The problem is they're usually wrong.

05:15.495 --> 05:18.931
What's up, Stu?
Where's all the action this weekend?

05:18.999 --> 05:21.797
Tampa-Oakland.
Everyone's jumping on Oakland.

05:21.868 --> 05:23.836
- That's crazy.
- You think?

05:23.903 --> 05:26.997
Yeah, man.
That game's gonna be won by coaching.

05:27.073 --> 05:30.270
Gruden put that Oakland team together
before he came to Tampa.

05:30.343 --> 05:32.368
He knows every strength and weakness.

05:32.445 --> 05:37.508
Brown catches to his left, so he'll have
him double-teamed to the defender's right.

05:37.584 --> 05:39.779
Gannon throws on a three-step drop.

05:39.853 --> 05:43.380
He'll stack the midfield with line backers,
take away the short pass.

05:43.456 --> 05:45.754
Gannon will throw three or four NTs Sunday.

05:45.825 --> 05:47.816
Fuck me.

05:47.894 --> 05:50.454
- You took Oaktown?
- Yeah, what do you think?

05:50.530 --> 05:53.727
I think I gotta
save your ass one more time.

05:53.800 --> 05:58.328
Take Tampa Bay on the money line.
They're gonna win this game outright.

05:58.405 --> 06:00.339
- Bet 'em big.
- Thanks, B.

06:00.407 --> 06:04.309
(Lang) Stu did bet 'em big,
and he won ten grand.

06:05.478 --> 06:09.107
I was quickly becoming
the biggest 900 line in Vegas.

06:10.150 --> 06:13.677
"Kansas City is seven to one against
point spread v division opponents

06:13.753 --> 06:17.814
"coming off a Monday night game.
Take KC minus the six.

06:17.891 --> 06:24.694
"Call tomorrow for my pro-football game
of the year. That's here at 900-656-3100.

06:24.764 --> 06:30.031
"Until then, this is Brandon Lang
saying good night and good gambling."

06:31.705 --> 06:33.536
Big plans this weekend?

06:33.606 --> 06:35.665
There you go.

06:37.377 --> 06:40.938
Steve. I went nine and two
on pro football Sunday,

06:41.014 --> 06:43.574
and hit my third straight
Monday-night parlay.

06:43.650 --> 06:47.279
- It's worth 12 bucks an hour.
- Hey, I don't make 12 an hour.

06:47.353 --> 06:49.685
You're not picking 75%.

06:49.756 --> 06:52.953
If you're that good, why don't you
bet your own games, get rich?

06:53.026 --> 06:55.153
Send me a postcard from the riviera.

06:55.228 --> 06:58.823
(#"Save Me (Wake Up Call)"
By Unwritten Law)

07:00.600 --> 07:02.625
What's going on, Denny?

07:02.702 --> 07:04.761
Hey, man. What's up?

07:05.205 --> 07:08.106
Big bro's making them greenbacks.
How about you, bro?

07:08.174 --> 07:11.268
I scrounged up some old headers, B.
Check it out. Fire it up.

07:11.344 --> 07:13.175
(man) All right, here goes.

07:13.246 --> 07:14.838
(howls)

07:15.381 --> 07:20.375
Jeez, I'm late. Honey, dinner's in the oven.
Where the hell's my lucky crucifix?

07:20.453 --> 07:25.083
Oh, I forgot to tell you. The mail came
and there's a letter for you from Chicago.

07:25.158 --> 07:27.922
You just went there
for your tryout last week.

07:28.495 --> 07:33.057
(Brandon) Another rejection letter.
"...strength of your knee in question."

07:33.133 --> 07:38.366
I only had two Arena teams left,
and after that there was always the CFL.

07:38.438 --> 07:41.498
# You can't save me

07:41.574 --> 07:44.634
# You can't change me

07:44.711 --> 07:48.477
# Well, I'm waiting for my wake-up call

07:48.548 --> 07:53.212
# And everything, everything's my fault

07:53.286 --> 07:55.220
Whoa! So what do you think?

07:55.288 --> 07:59.850
Should I ride shotgun
or do you want to hop on the handlebars?

07:59.926 --> 08:04.022
Hey, the packaging's not that great,
but there's a prize on the inside.

08:04.097 --> 08:06.930
What do you say? No?

08:07.000 --> 08:08.831
Oh, that's OK.

08:08.902 --> 08:11.427
You'll be back. I'll have a life.

08:13.139 --> 08:16.802
# Well, I'm waiting for my wake-up call

08:16.876 --> 08:19.606
# And everything's my fault

08:19.679 --> 08:21.510
Good morning, Mary.

08:21.581 --> 08:22.775
(phone rings)

08:24.884 --> 08:25.908
This is Brandon.

08:25.985 --> 08:30.251
Congratulations, you went nine and two
last Sunday. This is Walter Abrams.

08:30.323 --> 08:34.020
I don't know if you know me. I run
the biggest sports service in the country,

08:34.092 --> 08:35.957
and I'm a big fan of yours, Brandon.

08:36.029 --> 08:38.929
As a matter of fact,
I've got a poster of you on my wall.

08:38.998 --> 08:42.798
- This is a joke, right?
- No, this is not ajoke. This is ajob offer.

08:42.869 --> 08:48.136
In your top drawer- go ahead, open it up -
there's an envelope with your name on it.

08:48.208 --> 08:52.804
Now, that's travel cash and an airline
ticket. It's not a magic trick, Brandon.

08:52.879 --> 08:54.608
I paid someone to put it there,

08:54.681 --> 08:58.583
who told me that the place you're in
reminded him of a Turkish prison.

08:58.651 --> 09:01.643
Now, all I'm asking you to do
is come up with a number.

09:01.721 --> 09:05.088
You write down the number
of what you make now, you cross it out,

09:05.158 --> 09:07.217
you write what you should be making,

09:07.293 --> 09:11.662
and then toss in how much it's gonna take
to get you to fly to New York first-class

09:11.731 --> 09:13.858
and come work for me.

09:13.933 --> 09:16.333
Now, focus, Brandon, focus.

09:16.402 --> 09:21.032
With your bum knee, a comeback
isjust a dream. My offer is real.

09:21.107 --> 09:23.405
- Run the numbers, do the math.
- (phone rings)

09:23.476 --> 09:26.036
Hold on a second. Yeah.

09:27.180 --> 09:29.876
(Brandon) Mom holding twojobs,
Denny going to college,

09:29.949 --> 09:32.850
this looked like a chance
to make some real money.

09:32.919 --> 09:36.753
And besides, I'd never seen New York
and New York had never seen me.

09:36.823 --> 09:38.620
Oh, goodness. Hey.

09:38.691 --> 09:39.988
All right.

09:44.731 --> 09:49.464
So what's this guy Walter like?
How long have you been working for him?

09:49.535 --> 09:51.059
A long time.

09:51.137 --> 09:54.129
- Two weeks. (laughs)
- Two weeks.

09:54.207 --> 09:57.176
Every day with Walter's an adventure.

09:57.243 --> 09:59.108
# Super cool, super mean

09:59.178 --> 10:02.875
# Feelin' good for the man,
superfly, here I stand

10:02.949 --> 10:06.976
# Secret stash, heavy bread,
baddest bitches in the bed

10:07.053 --> 10:09.578
# I'm your pusherman

10:10.890 --> 10:13.120
# I'm your pusherman

10:28.841 --> 10:31.105
That's OK.

10:31.177 --> 10:34.203
All right, double it. Triple it.

10:34.280 --> 10:36.748
No, everything's about money.

10:36.816 --> 10:42.049
Listen, this Sunday my little girl,
an angel, turns six.

10:42.121 --> 10:43.952
This is not likely to happen again.

10:44.023 --> 10:47.823
She loves elephants.
Your circus has ten. I only need one.

10:48.294 --> 10:53.163
Now, my little girl's happiness
is in your hands.

10:53.232 --> 10:55.826
I don't need advice
from a guy who doubles as a clown.

10:55.902 --> 10:59.303
I need a fucking elephant.
Now, I'm willing to pay.

10:59.372 --> 11:04.400
What'll it take to grease your wheels
and get one here this weekend? Hello?

11:04.911 --> 11:06.708
Fuckwad!

11:06.779 --> 11:10.408
Find Ringling Brothers. Get someone
who understands profit. Whoa!

11:10.483 --> 11:12.280
Brandon Lang.

11:12.352 --> 11:14.445
The Marlboro man here.

11:14.520 --> 11:17.250
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey, you're in great shape.

11:17.323 --> 11:20.850
- I've been in better.
- You're modest too. Oh!

11:20.927 --> 11:24.727
Modesty - not a virtue.
Could be a vice. Sit down.

11:24.797 --> 11:27.061
There are rules to success, my friend.

11:27.133 --> 11:30.591
Rule number one is know what you know,
know what you don't know,

11:30.670 --> 11:34.265
and know that I gotta know everything
you know as soon as you know it.

11:34.340 --> 11:36.638
- Sooner.
- Yes, sir.

11:36.709 --> 11:39.200
- You ever sell before?
- No.

11:40.079 --> 11:42.604
- Are you religious?
- I believe in God.

11:42.682 --> 11:44.775
Hey, Liz.

11:44.851 --> 11:48.787
This is me 30 years ago, right?
It's remarkable the resemblance.

11:48.855 --> 11:51.756
I mean, he's a little taller. I'll give him that.

11:51.824 --> 11:57.319
Oh, boy, you know, I'm not supposed
to do this. It's bad for my... condition.

11:57.764 --> 12:01.029
Nobody knows this, Liz, OK?

12:01.100 --> 12:03.933
So before I die...

12:04.003 --> 12:06.995
Did you do anything
other than sports phone in Vegas?

12:07.073 --> 12:09.974
Just the 900 recordings,
you know, 10 bucks a call.

12:10.043 --> 12:11.442
That's chump change.

12:11.511 --> 12:14.309
I mean, we're going after
much bigger fish here.

12:14.380 --> 12:18.316
You know, networks don't talk about it,
government can't tax it,

12:18.384 --> 12:21.876
but sports betting
is a 200-billion-dollar-a-year business.

12:21.954 --> 12:23.046
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

12:23.122 --> 12:26.182
A lot of gamblers out there, man,
and they have needs.

12:26.259 --> 12:32.425
And come Monday morning after a losing
weekend, they got big needs. Gargantuan.

12:34.634 --> 12:37.899
See that? That's every
football game played last Sunday.

12:37.970 --> 12:41.599
You know why Monday-night football's
the most watched game of the week?

12:41.674 --> 12:45.838
Monday's the last chance bettors have
to climb out of the hole they got in

12:45.912 --> 12:47.880
to pay their bookies on Tuesday.

12:47.947 --> 12:52.043
Sports betting's illegal in 49 states,
including this one.

12:52.118 --> 12:54.086
But what we do is not.

12:54.153 --> 12:58.180
We are 100% legal, like stockbrokers,

12:58.257 --> 13:02.421
only instead of counting stocks,
we advise people on how to bet.

13:02.495 --> 13:07.831
Now, if a client wins by taking our advice,
we get a percentage, or we ask for one,

13:07.900 --> 13:11.996
which they will gladly give us because
they want to keep getting the advice.

13:12.071 --> 13:15.199
But if they lose, we get zip.

13:15.274 --> 13:21.941
So the object here, my dear,
tall, athletic, religious friend, is to win.

13:22.014 --> 13:24.414
I can do that.

13:27.186 --> 13:30.485
- (TV) Hello. This is Walter...
- Hello, Walter.

13:31.591 --> 13:34.219
That's my cable show.

13:34.293 --> 13:37.524
Now, after a nice
five-day vacation on my yacht...

13:37.597 --> 13:42.296
Airs Saturday and Sunday morning
nationwide. We tape Thursday and Fri...

13:42.368 --> 13:44.199
What's going on with my hair?

13:44.270 --> 13:46.966
He did it again, Liz.

13:47.039 --> 13:50.531
I got one part of my head in Cleveland,
the other's in Chicago.

13:50.610 --> 13:54.478
What are we gonna do with this guy?
My barber. Should be shot. I want him dead.

13:54.547 --> 13:56.913
(TV) For the first time,

13:56.983 --> 14:02.080
I'm gonna release our three-team
college and pro parlays absolutely free.

14:02.155 --> 14:06.922
If all the picks are free,
how'd you get the yacht?

14:06.993 --> 14:08.893
There's no yacht.

14:08.961 --> 14:10.826
Next question.

14:10.897 --> 14:15.766
Why give any picks for free?
Why not charge a fee up-front initially?

14:15.835 --> 14:18.895
You make a good point. Next.

14:18.971 --> 14:20.939
What's on the second floor?

14:21.007 --> 14:23.976
That's where we print the money.

14:24.810 --> 14:27.870
- Anything else?
- Of course not.

14:27.947 --> 14:31.474
No, I think I've got it.
I think everything's crystal clear, Walter.

14:31.551 --> 14:35.783
I like you, you know that?
You and me - this thing's gonna work.

14:35.855 --> 14:37.447
(phone rings)

14:37.523 --> 14:39.354
- I'm looking forward to it.
- Me too.

14:39.425 --> 14:41.450
(Liz) Ringling Brothers on one.

14:41.527 --> 14:45.463
Tell them to hold that elephant.
You ever have a manicure?

14:45.531 --> 14:47.294
There's a girl you gotta meet.

14:47.366 --> 14:52.394
- Yeah? What's she like?
- She's beautiful. You're gonna like her.

14:52.471 --> 14:53.995
Is this Barnum or Bailey?

14:59.545 --> 15:01.775
- (woman) I've got it.
- He's all yours.

15:01.847 --> 15:03.644
- Brandon?
- Yeah.

15:03.716 --> 15:05.513
- Hi. I'm Toni.
- Nice to meet you.

15:05.585 --> 15:07.644
Walter said you'd stop by.

15:07.720 --> 15:10.086
- This was his idea.
- Yeah, I know.

15:10.156 --> 15:12.556
Does he make
all of his employees do this?

15:12.625 --> 15:14.650
- Yep. Every one.
- How often?

15:14.727 --> 15:17.252
Once. Before they start work.

15:17.330 --> 15:19.491
- Weird.
- You think?

15:19.565 --> 15:22.056
I never had my nails done before.

15:22.134 --> 15:25.535
Yeah, I can see that,
but you've got strong hands. That's nice.

15:25.605 --> 15:27.436
Do you drink?

15:27.506 --> 15:28.803
Excuse me?

15:28.874 --> 15:32.401
- Alcohol. Are you a drinker?
- I have a beer every once in a while.

15:32.478 --> 15:35.140
- Do you smoke?
- No.

15:35.214 --> 15:38.149
- What about gambling?
- What about it?

15:38.217 --> 15:40.481
I'm sorry. I'm just a bit pressed for time.

15:40.553 --> 15:43.920
- I asked, do you bet? Are you a bettor?
- No.

15:44.423 --> 15:46.084
Really?

15:46.158 --> 15:47.955
Why not?

15:49.028 --> 15:51.189
Toni, huh?

15:52.865 --> 15:56.961
- Are you here full time?
- Yeah, no, this is my shop. I better be.

15:57.036 --> 15:59.470
So why don't you gamble?

15:59.538 --> 16:03.872
Well, I did once.
I wagered everything I had and I lost.

16:03.943 --> 16:05.274
So?

16:05.344 --> 16:08.370
I just swore I'd never do it again.

16:08.447 --> 16:10.574
- You're sticking to that story?
- Yeah.

16:10.650 --> 16:13.312
I'm not gonna start
this relationship off by lying.

16:13.386 --> 16:18.289
That's good. Walter could definitely use
someone with a little resolve in his life.

16:20.059 --> 16:22.254
Hey, Toni.

16:22.328 --> 16:24.728
Would you have dinner with me tonight?

16:24.797 --> 16:26.731
What do you say?

16:26.799 --> 16:29.768
- He didn't tell you.
- Tell me what?

16:29.835 --> 16:32.133
Brandon, Walter and I are married.

16:33.439 --> 16:37.307
Oh. Oh, bogey. Wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait. Listen.

16:37.376 --> 16:39.241
He said to come to meet a nice lady...

16:39.312 --> 16:42.110
I'm sure he did.
That's OK. I'll kill him when I get home.

16:42.181 --> 16:46.743
He has a big, bright, beautiful spirit,
though, and you will love working for him.

16:46.819 --> 16:48.719
But he is held together by meetings.

16:48.788 --> 16:51.814
If it has "anonymous" at the end,
he goes. He has to.

16:51.891 --> 16:54.553
He also has to be careful
who he lets into his life.

16:54.627 --> 16:58.529
Most ways, Walter's brilliant,
but he can be bullshitted and I can't.

16:58.597 --> 17:00.565
He sends them to me before hiring them.

17:00.633 --> 17:03.227
- So this was my interview.
- Oh, you're swift.

17:03.302 --> 17:04.997
How'd I do?

17:05.070 --> 17:08.563
Except for an illegal forward pass, perfect.
Congratulations.

17:08.641 --> 17:09.938
Thank you very much.

17:10.009 --> 17:12.569
1-800-238-6648.

17:12.645 --> 17:16.012
1-800, bet on it. Absolutely free.

17:16.449 --> 17:19.906
(Walter) This is the first floor,
and it's all yours.

17:19.984 --> 17:24.285
The TV's satellite, and it swivels.

17:24.357 --> 17:26.483
Your bedroom.

17:26.559 --> 17:30.359
Got a Jacuzzi in there
the size of a kiddy pool.

17:31.597 --> 17:34.862
You know what this is?
Looks like weights to me.

17:34.934 --> 17:37.027
Yeah, baby.

17:37.103 --> 17:40.436
Now, I'm gonna put your copy here...

17:40.506 --> 17:42.974
on your desk.

17:43.042 --> 17:44.942
Walter, this is sweet ass.

17:45.010 --> 17:49.106
- A man's chair.
- That's what I'm talking about.

17:50.182 --> 17:54.744
OK. I'm gonna start you on the 900 numbers.
Same gig you had in Vegas.

17:54.820 --> 17:59.086
Make your picks, record them each day.
Monday through Friday, once a day.

17:59.158 --> 18:01.149
- Five times a day on a weekend.
- Mm-hm.

18:01.594 --> 18:04.256
Each call's worth 25 bucks a shot.

18:04.330 --> 18:07.629
Now, we're doing about
three dozen hits a week. That's nothing.

18:07.700 --> 18:09.327
We should triple that.

18:09.402 --> 18:14.863
Now, before you get into your test copy
here, I got a few words for you.

18:14.940 --> 18:17.306
Your pitch sucks. No offence.

18:17.376 --> 18:21.403
But you got potential,
so we gotta find a way to bust you out.

18:21.480 --> 18:23.004
- Bust me out?
- Yeah.

18:23.082 --> 18:26.518
We're gonna start
by giving you a new name.

18:27.186 --> 18:30.451
John Anthony. Just came to me.

18:30.523 --> 18:33.981
John Anthony, the million-dollar man.

18:34.059 --> 18:35.856
What's wrong with Brandon Lang?

18:35.928 --> 18:40.388
Nothing's wrong with Brandon Lang.
It's just that he's still living with his mommy.

18:40.466 --> 18:42.331
John Anthony's living large.

18:42.401 --> 18:45.700
He don't hold back.
He's got a direct line to God.

18:45.771 --> 18:50.606
And for a measly 25 bucks a call,
he's gonna let the world's losers listen in.

18:51.210 --> 18:53.007
"Hello, sports fans.

18:53.078 --> 18:57.174
"This is John Anthony in the Big Apple
with my big-money picks.

18:57.249 --> 18:59.809
"The action starts Saturday
with college ball,

18:59.885 --> 19:03.343
"and our first match-up
is Michigan against Indiana.

19:03.422 --> 19:05.720
"The Wolverines..."

19:05.791 --> 19:07.190
I already hung up.

19:07.259 --> 19:10.660
John Anthony here, ready to make
all your betting dreams come true.

19:10.729 --> 19:13.926
That's right.
Call me right now and let me win for you.

19:13.999 --> 19:17.799
The point spread
in the Indiana-Michigan game is at...

19:17.870 --> 19:19.804
- I think it's all right.
- Wrong.

19:22.541 --> 19:24.202
Mm-hm.

19:24.276 --> 19:25.937
OK, what's your sales pitch?

19:26.011 --> 19:29.742
My sales pitch is I'm picking 80% winners.

19:30.816 --> 19:32.807
Stats is not enough.

19:32.885 --> 19:35.080
I'm telling you, you need a voice.

19:35.154 --> 19:39.989
These are gamblers ready to risk what
they can't afford for what they can't have.

19:40.059 --> 19:42.493
You're selling
the world's rarest commodity.

19:42.561 --> 19:45.086
You're selling certainty...

19:45.164 --> 19:47.632
in an uncertain world.

19:53.706 --> 19:55.867
(clears throat)

19:57.209 --> 19:59.302
John Anthony here,
the million-dollar man.

19:59.378 --> 20:03.838
Wall Street to Tokyo to Hollywood. All
your big money stays and plays with me.

20:03.916 --> 20:08.853
Sit back and relax. It's a Scud attack this
weekend. I am shelling your bookmaker.

20:08.921 --> 20:12.652
Follow his block and cut to the right.
Going in, Liz. Going in.

20:12.725 --> 20:16.092
That's it, isn't it? Huh?

20:17.162 --> 20:19.960
- It's a start.
- It's a start?

20:20.432 --> 20:22.593
What can I tell you?

20:22.668 --> 20:26.764
That's not what you want,
then you need to find somebody else to sell

20:26.839 --> 20:28.966
and let me just pick.

20:29.041 --> 20:31.202
It's not about what I want.

20:31.277 --> 20:33.677
You understand?
It's about what Brandon wants.

20:33.746 --> 20:37.045
If I hear that, I'm calling this number.

20:38.317 --> 20:41.684
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy, easy. Easy, easy.

20:41.754 --> 20:43.881
What is it? What is it? What is it?

20:43.956 --> 20:45.423
Shh.

20:46.659 --> 20:48.388
Should I call somebody?

20:48.460 --> 20:51.258
Not unless they got a spare heart.

20:52.731 --> 20:54.892
Shh.

20:56.735 --> 21:00.136
Oh, it's a small one. It's a teeny one.

21:00.205 --> 21:02.139
Breathe it out.

21:02.207 --> 21:04.698
- What do you need? Some water?
- I'll be all right.

21:04.777 --> 21:07.575
Oh, I know what I want.

21:07.646 --> 21:09.910
I know what I want.

21:11.850 --> 21:15.445
Be a good boy and get me a light.
Right there.

21:28.968 --> 21:31.459
What are you doing?

21:33.172 --> 21:36.107
Courage wants to laugh.

21:37.576 --> 21:40.704
(commentator) He makes the snap,
looks right, he throws.

21:40.779 --> 21:42.576
Phillips in for the touchdown!

21:42.648 --> 21:48.177
(commentator#2)... clearly in the defense
that does not give up the big plays.

21:48.253 --> 21:53.281
(commentator#3)... 23 over West Virginia.
Pittsburgh on a 47-yard field goal

21:53.359 --> 21:55.190
leads Virginia 10-7.

21:55.260 --> 21:57.820
North Carolina and Florida are scoreless.

21:57.896 --> 22:02.697
25th ranked Kansas trails Mississippi 7-3.
We'll be back with more scores...

22:02.768 --> 22:06.204
(commentator#2)
Back to the one-yard line...

22:07.272 --> 22:09.763
...and it will go against Utah again.

22:09.842 --> 22:12.811
With time-out on the field,
let's go to our studios in New York

22:12.878 --> 22:15.073
for an update on today's college football.

22:15.147 --> 22:19.243
- (Walter) Brandon!
- (commentary continues)

22:19.318 --> 22:21.252
(Walter) How we doing?

22:22.321 --> 22:23.583
Down here.

22:23.656 --> 22:27.888
(commentator#4)... while Michigan
just put the hammer to Illinois. 44-12.

22:27.960 --> 22:31.259
Florida - no problem
beating North Carolina 42 to 7,

22:31.330 --> 22:34.356
while Northern Washington
upset lowa State 28-21.

22:34.433 --> 22:38.369
Pennsylvania
manhandled Kentucky 31 to 3.

22:38.437 --> 22:40.496
Bullshit!

22:40.572 --> 22:42.972
(commentator#4)
...with a 17-7 win at Idaho.

22:43.042 --> 22:45.977
And thisjust in. Arizona is hot.

22:46.045 --> 22:48.878
All right! All right!

22:49.448 --> 22:52.383
This guy is a machine. I mean, he...

22:52.451 --> 22:56.410
All he does is work out and pick winners.

22:56.488 --> 23:00.720
Talk about fit.
You should see him with his shirt off.

23:00.793 --> 23:04.388
Really. I did. A serious side of beef.

23:04.463 --> 23:07.523
Enjoy your daughter's birthday. Come on.

23:08.600 --> 23:12.161
What do you mean?
You should check him out.

23:12.237 --> 23:14.569
- I know you want to.
- Walter.

23:14.640 --> 23:17.268
Get out of your head.
It's a bad neighborhood.

23:17.342 --> 23:20.140
- (commentator) Touchdown!
- (commentaries continue)

23:31.457 --> 23:35.188
I'm gonna have the bruchetta here,
and this right here.

23:35.260 --> 23:38.593
Very good.
And may I say, sir, an excellent choice.

23:39.531 --> 23:43.160
I think it's pronounced "bruschetta."
"Bruschetta."

23:43.235 --> 23:46.227
They're little pizzas,
but they don't have cheese in them.

23:46.305 --> 23:48.535
- Bruschetta?
- Perfect.

23:48.607 --> 23:54.170
Who cares? Anyone who goes 20 for 24
college football, 12 for 14 professional,

23:54.246 --> 23:59.513
175 calls on the 900 number, you can
call bruschetta anything you want, son.

23:59.585 --> 24:01.951
Ever have
a thousand-dollar bottle of wine?

24:02.020 --> 24:03.612
- No.
- Steward!

24:03.689 --> 24:07.853
- Walter, it's a waste. He hardly drinks.
- It's a celebration. Steward.

24:07.926 --> 24:09.723
- Walter, it's...
- Toni, come on.

24:09.795 --> 24:13.458
Just 'cause he's with reformed drunks
doesn't mean he can't enjoy himself.

24:13.532 --> 24:16.433
I was a lot of things, Walter,
I was never a drunk.

24:16.502 --> 24:18.697
Actually, truth be told,

24:18.771 --> 24:22.298
I've never had
a 12-dollar bottle of water either.

24:23.175 --> 24:25.006
- He thinks we're fighting.
- Yeah.

24:25.077 --> 24:31.175
No, I don't. Look, hey, this is great,
all of this. Thank you, Walter, Toni.

24:31.884 --> 24:33.875
Watch out, Walter. He's a fixer.

24:34.586 --> 24:38.386
- I should've ordered two.
- What did the doctor say? Come on.

24:38.457 --> 24:42.655
Well, if you really want to know - I've been
meaning to tell you - I went yesterday,

24:42.728 --> 24:44.889
and he seemed very concerned.

24:44.963 --> 24:48.763
Afterwards, he sat me down
and looked into my eyes, and he said:

24:48.834 --> 24:51.496
"Walter...

24:51.570 --> 24:54.368
"who do you like
in the Buffalo-Oakland game?"

24:54.439 --> 24:56.600
(laughter)

24:56.675 --> 25:01.374
- (Brandon) You tell him Buffalo?
- Shit, Walter. It wasn't funny.

25:01.446 --> 25:05.940
(Walter) You didn't know I was joking?
It's a joke. Jokes are funny.

25:08.954 --> 25:12.981
Wow, what a meal.
You haven't touched your sauce.

25:13.058 --> 25:15.618
It's chocolate. I hear it's good for you.

25:15.694 --> 25:19.596
- I'm not raising a kid alone, Walter.
- Come on, don't be dramatic, Toni.

25:19.665 --> 25:23.965
In biblical times, you'd just move in
with my brother Morty, anyway.

25:26.238 --> 25:29.036
Oh, look at that.

25:29.474 --> 25:32.170
Beauty and the beasts.
What do you think?

25:32.244 --> 25:35.179
I like her, man.
I think she's extremely cute.

25:35.247 --> 25:38.114
Brandon, she's looking at you.

25:38.684 --> 25:41.016
Yeah, but so are
those two guys she's with.

25:41.453 --> 25:47.016
I tell you what. I'll bet you ten to one
on a thousand you can't pick her up.

25:47.092 --> 25:50.528
That's 10,000 cash
if you leave this restaurant with that girl.

25:50.596 --> 25:54.692
I have a better idea. Why don't we go to
Atlantic City and open a house account?

25:54.766 --> 25:56.529
You know you can't gamble. Come on.

25:56.602 --> 26:01.835
Who's gambling? I haven't flipped a coin
since the '80s. This is just a challenge.

26:01.907 --> 26:04.034
A challenge?

26:04.109 --> 26:06.771
10,000... to one.

26:06.845 --> 26:09.541
- Cash?
- Mm-hm.

26:09.615 --> 26:12.641
What are you gonna do?

26:13.452 --> 26:15.750
- I'm gonna introduce myself.
- Before...

26:15.821 --> 26:17.550
Before you make your move, sit.

26:17.623 --> 26:20.148
- Where are you going?
- No problem. Don't worry.

26:20.225 --> 26:22.557
You sit here and rest your little self.

26:23.629 --> 26:27.463
Excuse me. I don't mean to interrupt
or anything, but I just gotta know this.

26:27.532 --> 26:30.729
We're sitting over there
with my friends and I'm thinking...

26:30.802 --> 26:33.862
You are drop-dead gorgeous,
and we just want to know...

26:33.939 --> 26:37.807
Your dates look like they haven't
missed a meal since Christ died.

26:37.876 --> 26:41.403
Seriously, you're eating
like you got a date with the electric chair.

26:41.480 --> 26:43.744
What is going on? No, no, no.

26:43.815 --> 26:46.113
It's all over. Sit, sit, sit.

26:46.184 --> 26:48.118
Just joking. Sorry.

26:48.186 --> 26:51.587
- I don't want to get wounded with a fork.
- Jerk. Moron.

26:51.657 --> 26:55.923
- I'm gone. Thank you very much.
- What the hell was that?

26:55.994 --> 26:57.985
- I went too far.
- Oh, yeah.

26:58.063 --> 27:02.056
- I'll buy them a bottle of champagne.
- You'll pick up their check.

27:02.134 --> 27:04.364
The voice of reason.

27:04.436 --> 27:07.530
Thank you. Uh-oh.

27:07.973 --> 27:10.965
Your date's going to the bathroom.

27:14.780 --> 27:18.079
I don't think that
helped me out too much, do you?

27:18.150 --> 27:19.139
Well...

27:19.217 --> 27:22.277
But, hey, thanks for the introduction.

27:22.354 --> 27:25.221
Hey, I was just raising the bar a little.

27:25.290 --> 27:27.986
John Anthony could close her.

27:33.165 --> 27:35.998
You are beautiful.

27:36.068 --> 27:39.162
- Excuse me.
- Hang on a second.

27:40.238 --> 27:42.798
I want to get to know you.

27:42.874 --> 27:46.105
You just want to get in my pants.

27:47.479 --> 27:51.279
No. No, no, no, no, no. I want to get
in your mind and your heart and your soul,

27:51.350 --> 27:55.650
and I don't see you
wearing any pants in that equation.

27:58.323 --> 28:00.416
Do you?

28:01.893 --> 28:04.453
Let me ask you something.

28:43.869 --> 28:46.895
(Walter) OK, forget the 900 numbers.
Now you're ready.

28:46.972 --> 28:49.600
We're moving up.
We're going to the second floor.

28:49.674 --> 28:53.872
This is where we print the money.
Put your ear to the door.

28:53.945 --> 28:55.776
Wow.

28:55.847 --> 28:59.010
That's the sound of possibilities.

28:59.084 --> 29:02.520
This is it. This is where
the sales people turn a ten-dollar bettor

29:02.587 --> 29:05.784
into a 1,000-dollar bettor
before he knows he made the call.

29:05.857 --> 29:09.258
I'm asking do they use
Astroturf or AstroPlay?

29:09.327 --> 29:11.955
Tammy. Give it up, baby.

29:12.030 --> 29:14.260
- You know what I need.
- Sure do.

29:14.332 --> 29:16.960
- Tammy, this is Brandon.
- How are you, Tammy?

29:17.035 --> 29:20.493
OK, this is our phone sheet.
The losers who need us.

29:20.572 --> 29:22.506
The more they bet, the more we win.

29:22.574 --> 29:26.977
We take 10% of a winning bet
anywhere from 500 to 500,000.

29:27.045 --> 29:30.981
- That's Southie.
- Let's make some serious money.

29:31.049 --> 29:33.574
- What's the game plan?
- (man) You know what?

29:33.652 --> 29:37.679
You're a private security guard.
Bang a cheerleader, extract the information.

29:38.123 --> 29:42.822
Well, it was a substantial sum.
Walter, he's a little miffed at our picks.

29:42.894 --> 29:44.418
Just do what you got to do.

29:44.496 --> 29:47.795
It says right here
that the minimum bet is five grand.

29:47.866 --> 29:52.462
Reggie Hawks. Best salesman ever. Ever.

29:52.537 --> 29:55.938
I don't have time for this kind of shit,
Jimmy. I know you're a loser.

29:56.007 --> 29:58.601
If you were a big winner,
you wouldn't pay to call me.

29:59.611 --> 30:02.603
(Reggie) You got your head
outta your ass yet?

30:03.415 --> 30:05.940
Is this my office?

30:06.017 --> 30:10.249
- Well, do you like it?
- What's not to like, Walter? Thank you.

30:11.089 --> 30:13.922
Miami New York point spread
just went up to ten.

30:13.992 --> 30:18.452
- What do you think?
- Miami is a lock. Are you kidding me?

30:18.530 --> 30:22.967
This is Jerry, my top handicapper.
Came to me straight out of grad school.

30:23.034 --> 30:26.367
Whoa. Phone boy makes good, huh?
It's a big jump from 900 numbers.

30:26.438 --> 30:29.965
Make sure you don't get
a nosebleed up here. I'm just kidding.

30:30.041 --> 30:33.238
- Nice meeting you. Gotta get to work.
- Nice meeting you too.

30:33.311 --> 30:36.712
Say, by the way, tonight's game...

30:36.781 --> 30:39.181
New York wins that outright.

30:39.251 --> 30:40.548
Really?

30:40.619 --> 30:43.747
They always play the Fish tough
and tonight it's foregone.

30:43.822 --> 30:48.156
I wish I had a pen because I would
never write that down. You know...

30:48.226 --> 30:50.786
college is right for you.

30:50.862 --> 30:54.059
You have to work your way up
to pro ball around here. Good luck.

30:54.132 --> 30:57.898
Rookie's got balls.
I almost like it, but I don't. Good luck.

30:57.969 --> 30:59.561
I get that all day.

30:59.638 --> 31:04.371
You know, I got three guys who can
pick games, I got 20 who can sell.

31:04.442 --> 31:06.910
I never had one who could do both.

31:06.978 --> 31:09.811
- What? You mean me?
- No, not you.

31:09.881 --> 31:11.781
I'm talking about John Anthony.

31:11.850 --> 31:14.751
John Anthony doesn't exist.

31:14.819 --> 31:16.514
Oh? Well, I'm shocked,

31:16.588 --> 31:20.888
because I'm standing in his office
and you're sitting in his chair.

31:20.959 --> 31:23.553
So you want me to sell.

31:24.629 --> 31:26.790
- Like those guys out there?
- Yes.

31:26.865 --> 31:30.995
Big bettors don't want middlemen.
They want the guy giving them the picks.

31:31.069 --> 31:33.867
- You got a problem with selling?
- No. I don't have a...

31:33.939 --> 31:36.032
There's a few choice phrases we use here.

31:36.107 --> 31:38.803
You just start with those.
Now, here's an easy one.

31:38.877 --> 31:42.335
I don't want your money.
I want your bookie's fucking money.

31:42.781 --> 31:45.511
Give it back to me.

31:45.584 --> 31:48.178
I don't want your money.

31:48.253 --> 31:50.016
I want your bookie's money.

31:50.088 --> 31:53.489
I don't want your money.
I want your bookie's money.

31:53.558 --> 31:55.492
That's not bad.

31:55.560 --> 31:58.051
- What happened to "fuck"?
- What about it?

31:58.129 --> 32:00.689
- I said it. You don't use it?
- Nah.

32:00.765 --> 32:04.360
- Really? A religious thing?
- No, it's not a religious thing. I just...

32:04.436 --> 32:07.667
It was all right for Chaucer 600 years ago.

32:07.739 --> 32:11.607
Hey! I don't want to embarrass you,
but I gotta do this.

32:11.676 --> 32:14.645
I got someone here
who has a problem saying "fuck."

32:14.713 --> 32:17.580
- (Southie) Hold on.
- (all) Fuck you!

32:20.552 --> 32:23.214
(Brandon) Look at that.
A lot of brunettes.

32:23.288 --> 32:25.051
Where are we headed?

32:25.123 --> 32:27.591
We're gonna continue your education.

32:30.462 --> 32:33.761
- Hi. Is this the meeting?
- Yes, yes. Come on in. Hi.

32:33.832 --> 32:39.498
You'd think with two mortgages out,
the repo guys staking out my car,

32:39.571 --> 32:43.940
my job on the line, and my wife
threatening to leave, that I'd stop,

32:44.009 --> 32:46.375
instead of staying in the chase,
doubling down.

32:46.444 --> 32:48.344
It's a disease, Leon.

32:48.413 --> 32:52.144
Yeah, man. Look, admitting
you have a problem is the first step.

32:52.217 --> 32:53.707
(woman) Yeah.

32:53.785 --> 32:58.279
I guess I must be doing pretty good
because I've got one big problem.

32:58.356 --> 33:01.257
- (man) Don't worry about it, Leon.
- It's OK, Leon.

33:01.326 --> 33:04.090
- (woman) Hang in there, Leon.
- Hey.

33:04.162 --> 33:06.596
My name is Walter
and I'm new to this group...

33:06.665 --> 33:07.825
(all) Hey, Walter.

33:07.899 --> 33:11.630
...but I am not new to these meetings.
I've been coming 18 years now.

33:11.703 --> 33:16.037
As a matter of fact, friends,
this is my 936th consecutive meeting.

33:16.107 --> 33:18.871
- (man) Hey, man, well done.
- (applause)

33:18.943 --> 33:21.810
(Walter) Well done is right.

33:21.880 --> 33:27.716
And in all that time I haven't once been
to a track or a casino or bet on a game.

33:27.786 --> 33:30.050
Hand to God, not a cent.

33:30.121 --> 33:33.420
So I know where you're coming from, Leon.

33:33.491 --> 33:37.518
Believe me, I know. I heard your story,
and it's something I relate to,

33:37.595 --> 33:42.464
but I gotta say, if I learned anything,
it's that gambling is not your problem.

33:42.534 --> 33:44.297
- It's not?
- Not even close.

33:44.369 --> 33:50.001
I don't know how to say this without
sounding rude, but you're a lemon, Leon.

33:50.608 --> 33:54.601
Like a bad car, there is something
inherently defective in you.

33:54.679 --> 33:58.581
And you. And you. And me.
And all of us in this room.

33:58.650 --> 34:02.142
We're all lemons.
We look like everybody else,

34:02.220 --> 34:06.316
but what makes us different is our defect.

34:06.391 --> 34:10.190
You see, most gamblers,
when they go to gamble, they go to win.

34:10.261 --> 34:13.753
When we go to gamble,
we go to lose, subconsciously.

34:13.831 --> 34:18.963
Me, I never feel better, or more alive,
than when they're raking the chips away,

34:19.036 --> 34:22.302
not bringing them in, and everybody
knows what I'm talking about.

34:22.373 --> 34:26.435
Hell, even when we win, it's just
a matter of time before we give it all back.

34:26.511 --> 34:29.639
But when we lose,
now, there's another story, when we lose.

34:29.714 --> 34:31.909
I'm talking about the kind of loss

34:31.983 --> 34:35.282
that makes your asshole pucker up
to the size of a decimal point.

34:35.353 --> 34:39.983
You know what I mean? You've just
recreated the worst possible nightmare

34:40.058 --> 34:44.154
this side of malignant cancer
for the 20th goddamn time,

34:44.228 --> 34:46.993
and you're standing there
and you suddenly realize:

34:47.065 --> 34:50.466
"Hey, I'm still here.

34:50.534 --> 34:52.161
"I'm still breathing.

34:52.237 --> 34:54.364
"I'm still alive."

34:54.438 --> 34:57.306
Us lemons, we fuck shit up
all the time on purpose,

34:57.375 --> 35:01.004
because we constantly
need to remind ourselves we're alive.

35:01.079 --> 35:04.014
Leon, gambling's not your problem.

35:04.082 --> 35:06.744
It's this fucked-up need

35:06.818 --> 35:08.615
to feel something,

35:08.686 --> 35:11.416
to convince yourself you exist.

35:13.558 --> 35:15.788
That's the problem.

35:23.101 --> 35:28.733
Hey, you're the guy I see on TV
every weekend selling betting picks.

35:28.807 --> 35:31.503
- So what?
- Oh, yeah, he's right. This guy...

35:31.576 --> 35:33.771
This guy peddles a tout service on TV.

35:33.845 --> 35:36.871
You read the charter, buddy?
We all left our jobs at the door.

35:36.948 --> 35:40.850
Are you gonna throw an ex-alcoholic
bartender out of an AA meeting?

35:40.919 --> 35:43.285
- What?
- You're gonna do that? That's bogus.

35:43.354 --> 35:46.050
- Hey, didn't you come in with this jerk?
- Come on.

35:46.124 --> 35:48.217
I don't like the feeling I'm getting.

35:48.293 --> 35:51.194
If you rethink things, here's my card.

35:51.262 --> 35:54.231
We're topping 80% this season.
Put it in your wallet.

35:54.299 --> 35:57.132
- You never know when you'll relapse.
- (woman) Get out!

35:58.870 --> 36:01.430
What the fuck was that?

36:02.774 --> 36:05.140
- What did you just say?
- That was bullshit.

36:05.210 --> 36:08.441
- You gave your business card...
- No, no. You said fuck.

36:08.513 --> 36:12.779
- So what?
- Brandon. So what? That's great, man.

36:12.851 --> 36:15.319
It was all worth it just from that one word.

36:15.386 --> 36:20.551
From the one word fuck, I could feel
your frustration, I could feel your anger.

36:20.625 --> 36:21.990
Man, I'm proud of you.

36:31.703 --> 36:33.967
His name is Amir.

36:34.038 --> 36:35.596
He's a dime bettor.

36:35.673 --> 36:36.901
Owns a dry cleaners.

36:36.975 --> 36:40.308
- We got him for the subscription.
- Amir...

36:40.378 --> 36:43.836
He's on line one. Mm, ding, ding.

36:49.587 --> 36:51.851
Mm.

36:51.923 --> 36:53.390
Good morning.

36:53.458 --> 36:56.427
Walter wanted
your first call to be special.

36:56.494 --> 36:59.292
- OK. Go get 'em, tiger.
- You got it.

37:00.532 --> 37:02.966
Me-me-me-me-ow-ow-ow!

37:03.034 --> 37:04.592
Mm-hm.

37:04.669 --> 37:07.900
- Amir, my man. John Anthony here.
- Yes. Hello.

37:07.972 --> 37:10.304
Yes, hello to you, sir.
How's your morning?

37:10.375 --> 37:15.039
Mine started off outstanding.
Not as outstanding as I plan my weekend being.

37:15.113 --> 37:17.707
Billy, listen.
Thanks for the $15,000 FedEx.

37:17.782 --> 37:20.717
It's called a three-team parlay.
It pays six to one.

37:21.185 --> 37:23.153
How much can you lay? 20 grand?

37:23.221 --> 37:25.189
Are you crazy?

37:25.256 --> 37:28.783
No way. Listen,
I was betting a thousand a game.

37:28.860 --> 37:33.194
I've got a game that I'm calling
my lock of the decade, OK? Texas v OU.

37:33.264 --> 37:35.960
Now, Texas is receiving
six points in this game.

37:36.034 --> 37:39.526
- They're gonna win it by two touchdowns.
- Really?

37:39.604 --> 37:42.402
- I like Oklahoma in that game.
- You do?

37:42.473 --> 37:44.964
I shouldn't have called.
Thank you for your time.

37:45.043 --> 37:47.011
Hold on. I've got Vegas on the line.

37:47.078 --> 37:51.708
When we get our 30 grand from last night,
then I tell you who he likes next week.

37:51.783 --> 37:56.049
The only thing you gotta know about any
of our clients is that they're all in a hole.

37:56.120 --> 37:58.588
The second they pick up the phone,
you got 'em.

37:58.656 --> 38:02.524
I'll tell you once. Green Bay, Dallas,
Cleveland. 100,000 across the board.

38:02.994 --> 38:05.929
Get to the point, you're above them.

38:05.997 --> 38:09.763
Let 'em know it. Let 'em feel it.
More John Anthony.

38:09.834 --> 38:11.699
Amir.

38:11.769 --> 38:15.671
- What's your favorite drink, my man?
- Favorite drink?

38:15.740 --> 38:17.640
I don't know.

38:17.709 --> 38:19.404
- Piña colada.
- Whoa.

38:20.778 --> 38:25.408
Tomorrow, we gotta get you a new drink,
but today, here's what you're gonna do.

38:25.483 --> 38:28.577
You're gonna go down to your bookie
and lay 20 large on Texas.

38:28.653 --> 38:31.781
Then you'll go home,
put on your favorite Hawaiian shirt,

38:31.856 --> 38:34.416
and you'll sit back,
twirl your little umbrella

38:34.492 --> 38:39.623
after you've made that rum concoction
with the orange slice and the cherry,

38:39.697 --> 38:42.632
and you'll watch Texas
rip those Okies a new asshole.

38:42.700 --> 38:46.158
And after you win the 20 grand,
you're gonna call me back

38:46.237 --> 38:49.434
and you're gonna tell me,
"Thank you, sir. May I have another?"

38:49.507 --> 38:53.705
McNeil lost his dog last week
to a hunting accident.

38:53.778 --> 38:56.713
You don't mess with a man
who just lost his dog.

38:56.781 --> 39:00.114
Western Union me ten thou
and let's ride this wave into Sunday.

39:00.184 --> 39:03.381
Denny, boy!
I've got something good for this weekend.

39:03.454 --> 39:07.447
Green Bay against Minnesota. I want
you to lay $500 on the Cheeseheads.

39:07.525 --> 39:10.756
Let Stu in on that too,
and take care of Mama. Talk to you later.

39:10.828 --> 39:11.988
Tammy, who's on four?

39:12.063 --> 39:14.361
Forget the other games you wanted to bet.

39:14.432 --> 39:17.890
Let's throw that 4,000 on this 1,000
and make it five,

39:17.969 --> 39:20.437
take it money line and turn it into 12,000.

39:20.505 --> 39:22.530
John Anthony here.

39:23.508 --> 39:27.103
(commentator) Hello, everybody,
and welcome to "Football Tonight."

39:27.178 --> 39:31.274
(commentator#2)... ten-yard
line, he passes and that's a blind throw...

39:31.349 --> 39:33.317
(commentator#3) He's in the end zone!

39:33.384 --> 39:36.285
- (commentator#1) Touchdown!
- Yes!

39:36.487 --> 39:41.151
(commentator#1) Good ball game.
10-7. Oakland upsets New York.

39:53.271 --> 39:56.604
OK. No, that sounds good.
Actually, you know what? Monday...

39:56.674 --> 39:59.268
Go, Daddy, go! Can't you go any faster?

39:59.343 --> 40:02.176
Hey! Ten and two, pro football?

40:02.246 --> 40:05.773
85% weekend. You're a mutant!

40:05.850 --> 40:08.683
I definitely want to be there with him.
Put it on a plate.

40:08.753 --> 40:13.554
Oh, my God. Thank you. You saved my life.
That is beautiful.

40:13.624 --> 40:16.422
What... What's going on?

40:16.494 --> 40:20.624
Walter's doctor - this is good news -
finally put him on an exercise program.

40:20.698 --> 40:22.290
I want to be there the first time

40:22.366 --> 40:26.666
to make sure the trainer understands
his aversion to consistency. Excuse me.

40:26.738 --> 40:29.002
- Aversion to consistency?
- Mm-hm.

40:29.073 --> 40:32.042
That's Walter. He's always been that way.

40:32.777 --> 40:36.838
- Well, that's consistent.
- Well, that's true. (laughs)

40:37.281 --> 40:40.045
You are cute. Take a bite.
Tell me what you think.

40:40.118 --> 40:42.643
Life is fucking good.

40:43.721 --> 40:47.589
So... let's talk about making it better.

40:47.658 --> 40:50.456
Uh-oh. Duck, Brandon. Here it comes.

40:52.363 --> 40:56.356
I'm thinking of putting
John Anthony on TV this week.

40:56.434 --> 40:58.800
If you do this, from here on out,

40:58.870 --> 41:01.600
you're gonna have to eat, sleep,

41:01.672 --> 41:03.435
drink, breathe,

41:03.508 --> 41:07.274
talk, walk and fart John Anthony.

41:08.112 --> 41:10.376
That's the way it is.
There's no holding back.

41:10.448 --> 41:13.542
You gotta be it,
completely, or it doesn't work.

41:13.618 --> 41:18.282
That's right, and just think it over.
Don't decide now.

41:18.356 --> 41:21.553
It's the only move.
If it means I've gotta act, that's cool.

41:21.626 --> 41:25.027
No. No acting. This is living.

41:25.096 --> 41:28.065
You didn't hear me.

41:28.132 --> 41:30.293
From here on out,

41:30.368 --> 41:33.360
Brandon Lang and his fettuccine knee,

41:33.437 --> 41:39.137
and his self-fucking-pity,
is as flat dead as Donald Trump's hair.

41:40.211 --> 41:45.148
And John "I Can Walk On Fucking Water"
Anthony has taken his place.

41:45.216 --> 41:47.912
Now, listen
to what he's asking you, Brandon.

41:47.985 --> 41:50.579
I'm gonna build an empire around you.

41:51.622 --> 41:54.022
It's gonna cost me.

41:54.792 --> 41:59.729
- You understand what I'm saying?
- Hell, yeah, I understand.

41:59.797 --> 42:03.733
I'm John fucking Anthony.
I've got a crystal ball.

42:03.801 --> 42:06.770
(# "I'm Sitting on Top of the World"
by Bobby Darin)

42:06.838 --> 42:12.003
# I am sitting on top of the world,
just rolling along

42:12.910 --> 42:17.313
OK, John Anthony breathes.

42:17.381 --> 42:20.009
Now we gotta get a walk and talk.

42:20.084 --> 42:21.813
(man) I'm just asking.

42:21.886 --> 42:24.548
(Walter) I'm looking for a car
for my friend here.

42:24.622 --> 42:27.352
- Let's see. What's his name?
- John Anthony.

42:27.425 --> 42:29.620
- Mr. Anthony.
- Yes, sir.

42:29.694 --> 42:31.753
- Do you have any credit?
- No.

42:31.829 --> 42:35.697
Of course not. I don't know, Wally,
can you trust him?

42:35.766 --> 42:37.859
With my wife.

42:37.935 --> 42:40.961
- Naked.
- Well, in that case, the floor is yours.

42:41.038 --> 42:44.667
# Glory, hallelujah,
I just phoned the parson

42:44.742 --> 42:47.711
# Hey, Pa, get ready to call

42:47.778 --> 42:52.477
# Just like Humpty Dumpty
I'm about to fall

42:52.550 --> 42:56.281
- Hey, what's "900 King"?
- That's me. John Anthony.

42:56.354 --> 42:58.845
- I don't lose.
- Thank you.

42:58.923 --> 43:03.155
I want you to meet Mr. Miracle,
John Anthony. There he is.

43:03.227 --> 43:06.219
It's never ever gonna go down.

43:08.766 --> 43:09.892
Give me all you got.

43:09.967 --> 43:12.936
# Singing a song

43:13.004 --> 43:15.404
I'm ready. I'm ready.

43:16.474 --> 43:18.408
A star is born today. How you doing?

43:18.476 --> 43:20.501
- Scared shitless.
- You're sweating.

43:20.578 --> 43:24.912
You'll be all right. Don't worry. You've got
the script. Read off the TelePrompTer.

43:24.982 --> 43:26.973
You've been here before, kid.

43:27.051 --> 43:29.747
- Remember football?
- No, this is different.

43:29.820 --> 43:32.550
- How's this different?
- No opponent.

43:32.623 --> 43:36.354
- Then you're a lock to win.
- (man) Walter, we're ready.

43:36.427 --> 43:39.885
You'll be OK.
Remember, stay with the script.

43:40.498 --> 43:42.125
45 seconds.

43:42.199 --> 43:45.566
- That's a lifetime.
- For you, boss. This is for you.

43:45.636 --> 43:48.537
(man) Tony, you good?
OK, everybody, we're gonna go.

43:48.606 --> 43:50.369
- (man #2) We back?
- (man #1) Places.

43:50.441 --> 43:52.568
- John Anthony, huh?
- Yep.

43:52.643 --> 43:55.635
All's I see is another wannabe
in a thousand-dollar suit.

43:55.713 --> 43:58.409
Word to the wise,
keep the suit you came in with.

43:58.482 --> 44:00.382
All right, Jethro? Good luck to you.

44:00.451 --> 44:02.749
In five, four...

44:02.820 --> 44:05.653
- I'll do that.
...three, two...

44:06.490 --> 44:09.084
Welcome to this week's Sports Advisors,

44:09.160 --> 44:13.620
America's premier sports-information
program, with myself, Walter Abrams,

44:13.698 --> 44:15.689
Jerry Sykes, Chuck Adler

44:15.766 --> 44:18.792
and a truly gifted newcomer
to the Sports Advisorpanel.

44:18.869 --> 44:23.431
I want you to meet him, a substantial find,
and his name is John Anthony.

44:23.507 --> 44:26.943
OK, we're entering week six
in professional football.

44:27.011 --> 44:31.072
This is when the cream rises to the top.
This is when things get hot.

44:31.148 --> 44:35.016
This is oven-mitt time. Am I right?
This is big-time ball season.

44:35.086 --> 44:39.989
So let's get right into it with the wizard
of odds, Jerry "The Source" Sykes. Jerry.

44:40.057 --> 44:43.618
Stats, records, rankings, weather,

44:43.694 --> 44:46.458
if the goalpost is tilted just a little bit...

44:46.530 --> 44:50.057
The SYKES system
uses 42 proven indexes

44:50.134 --> 44:52.864
to eliminate
the guesswork in sports wagering.

44:52.937 --> 44:55.735
Without my patented
computer-based picks,

44:55.806 --> 45:00.800
you got a better shot of having God
show up at your door with nine strippers,

45:00.878 --> 45:02.869
a bag of pure Bolivian cocaine,

45:02.947 --> 45:05.541
enough Viagra
to make Chuck's head blow off,

45:05.616 --> 45:07.811
than picking these things on your own.

45:07.885 --> 45:11.981
You call me absolutely free. I got five
picks this weekend that are incredible.

45:12.056 --> 45:15.617
1-800-238-6648. Give me a call.

45:15.693 --> 45:19.925
How many gamblers did I bail out
last weekend with my game of the year?

45:19.997 --> 45:22.693
A 100-dollar bettor made $10,000.

45:22.767 --> 45:26.726
A 500-dollar bettor made $50,000.

45:26.804 --> 45:30.797
Well, I got six games on Sunday
that I'm releasing absolutely free.

45:30.875 --> 45:34.868
These games are a burial,
a blowout, a human lock.

45:34.945 --> 45:40.884
You can bet your children's unborn
children's children on these six games

45:40.951 --> 45:44.318
absolutely free!

45:44.388 --> 45:46.481
Whoa, whoa, I believe, I believe!

45:46.557 --> 45:49.549
I believe you're trying to make me deaf.

45:49.627 --> 45:53.961
I've never seen a color on a man like that.
Would you say that's chartreuse?

45:54.031 --> 45:59.492
So Saturday comes before Sunday, and
looking at Saturday's college match-ups

45:59.570 --> 46:03.131
is the last, but certainly not least,
member of the sports advisors.

46:03.207 --> 46:07.007
- And here he is, Mr. John Anthony.
- Thank you, Walter.

46:07.078 --> 46:11.845
This is John Anthony, the million-dollar
man with the billion-dollar plan.

46:11.916 --> 46:13.747
Wall Street to Tokyo to Hollywood,

46:13.818 --> 46:16.651
all your big money
is gonna stay and play with me.

46:16.720 --> 46:20.656
That's right. That's why
they call me the million-dollar man.

46:20.724 --> 46:24.820
The million-dollar man, the million-dollar
man, the million-dollar man.

46:24.895 --> 46:27.363
I can't say that, man.

46:28.566 --> 46:31.467
- Uh...
- (Brandon) No, no.

46:31.535 --> 46:35.437
Somebody wrote
some very clever stuff for me here,

46:35.506 --> 46:37.872
like the million-dollar man.

46:38.809 --> 46:40.868
So let's just call me John.

46:40.945 --> 46:44.108
I played quarterback, division one.

46:44.181 --> 46:50.416
Every QB knows that the secret,
the key, to victory is anticipation.

46:50.488 --> 46:53.355
The ability to see the future and react to it.

46:53.424 --> 46:55.221
Now, that is what I do.

46:55.292 --> 46:57.192
And that is the truth.

46:57.261 --> 47:02.221
So I'm not gonna sell you today, all right?
I'm just gonna tell you the facts.

47:02.299 --> 47:04.426
For over one year,

47:04.502 --> 47:08.131
I have been picking 80% winners.

47:08.572 --> 47:10.563
Unbelievable?

47:10.641 --> 47:12.302
Used to be.

47:12.376 --> 47:15.106
I know the leagues. I know the teams.

47:15.179 --> 47:19.309
I know these players.
I know this wonderful game called football.

47:19.383 --> 47:22.477
Call the number
on the bottom of your screen,

47:22.553 --> 47:24.646
and ask for John.

47:24.722 --> 47:27.213
Let's make some money.

47:41.972 --> 47:44.566
(coughing)

47:50.381 --> 47:52.440
Walter.

47:52.516 --> 47:57.351
- I'm not here. Go back to sleep.
- Walter, it's four in the morning, honey.

47:57.421 --> 47:59.355
What a show.

47:59.423 --> 48:01.857
Come to bed.

48:01.926 --> 48:04.190
Man, you should have seen him.

48:04.261 --> 48:07.560
I just sat there and watched him roll.

48:07.631 --> 48:10.862
I swear he made me
want to pick up a phone and call.

48:10.935 --> 48:15.167
I took the sales boys down the Smith and Wo's
to get them primed for the weekend,

48:15.239 --> 48:22.236
and Chuck got so drunk he took a swing
at one of the deer heads on the wall.

48:22.313 --> 48:25.544
I don't know what we're gonna do.
I'll hire more guys on Monday.

48:25.616 --> 48:28.050
I got to. I gotta get more phones.

48:28.118 --> 48:30.678
- Everything's amping up.
- Yeah?

48:30.754 --> 48:32.949
This guy, I'm telling you,

48:33.023 --> 48:36.982
I'm gonna do this whole dot-com thing
around him, you know?

48:37.061 --> 48:41.157
I swear, if I had me when I was his age...

48:41.232 --> 48:43.530
you know, I never had a mentor.

48:43.601 --> 48:46.161
Now I got a protégé. You know?

48:46.237 --> 48:49.468
Someone you hand it all down to.

48:49.540 --> 48:52.998
If anything happens to me, he steps in.

48:53.077 --> 48:55.602
He steps in.

48:55.679 --> 48:58.409
Just knowing that,
with this thing, you know.

48:58.482 --> 49:01.974
- It's like having a son.
- Walter, come here.

49:02.052 --> 49:05.544
It's beautiful. It's beautiful, beautiful.

49:06.624 --> 49:09.684
- You gotta go back to sleep.
- What are you doing?

49:09.760 --> 49:13.696
- I'm gonna go... I'm gonna go for a run.
- No. Walter...

49:13.764 --> 49:17.063
- See the sunrise.
- Come here. Just for a second.

49:17.134 --> 49:18.761
Come here. You're exhausted.

49:18.836 --> 49:24.536
No, I'm not. I wanna go do the bridge
thing, you know, up-up-up Fifth?

49:24.608 --> 49:29.511
Walter, I haven't seen you all day.
Just come to bed for one minute.

49:29.580 --> 49:33.243
Just for a minute, 'cause, you know,
I've got the trainer tomorrow.

49:33.317 --> 49:36.309
- The trainer wants me to run.
- I know, baby.

49:36.387 --> 49:39.618
- He wants me to run in place, you know?
- I know, honey.

49:39.690 --> 49:42.124
Run from one place to another place.

49:42.192 --> 49:46.959
No time to sleep, just because you're so
exhausted, I mean, that's no time to sleep.

49:47.031 --> 49:49.829
You're right. No time for sleep.

49:49.900 --> 49:53.097
I'll be right here
when you get back from your run.

49:53.170 --> 49:54.728
That's nice of you.

49:54.805 --> 49:58.901
- I'll be right here right beside you, Walter.
- Oh, that's nice of you.

49:58.976 --> 50:01.444
I'm not going anywhere.

50:01.512 --> 50:03.810
It's OK.

50:03.881 --> 50:08.875
Just close your eyes
for one second before you go, OK?

50:12.790 --> 50:15.190
Know about Stokey
being out against New York?

50:15.259 --> 50:18.786
- A knock would be nice, Jerry.
- I'm kinda underwater here, man.

50:18.862 --> 50:22.229
- A yes or no would be great.
- No, I don't.

50:22.299 --> 50:25.996
If you know something, or if you
hear anything, you gotta let me know,

50:26.070 --> 50:28.129
'cause that's the way we work.

50:28.205 --> 50:31.072
I'll rush right over, stat.

50:31.141 --> 50:33.803
I've been here six years.
You've been here one.

50:33.877 --> 50:38.576
What are you doing in here?
Hit the phones, man. Do some damage control.

50:38.649 --> 50:40.776
Rewrite that friggin' computer program.

50:40.851 --> 50:43.479
- Hey, it was a fucked weekend.
- For some people.

50:43.554 --> 50:46.682
There's a 50-dime bettor
who wants to talk to John Anthony.

50:46.757 --> 50:50.591
- What's his name?
- Carl. He owns McDonald's franchises.

50:50.661 --> 50:53.459
Wait a minute.
I landed that lead. He's my guy.

50:53.530 --> 50:55.293
- Was.
- He's raiding my list now?

50:55.366 --> 50:59.200
Your clients are jumping ship,
you lactose-intolerant fuck. Get out.

50:59.269 --> 51:00.964
- Come on.
- Excuse me.

51:02.506 --> 51:05.339
We're home! We're home!
We're home! We're home!

51:05.409 --> 51:07.673
(laughter)

51:07.745 --> 51:11.579
- Can we play princess?
- Oh, yes, can we play princess.

51:11.648 --> 51:14.446
You go get in your princess outfit.
Everything, OK?

51:14.518 --> 51:17.282
I'll put the groceries away,
then I'll come and play.

51:17.354 --> 51:20.118
- OK!
- You go ahead.

51:20.190 --> 51:22.715
You got it made. You gotta admit that.

51:23.794 --> 51:26.228
(Walter) I got a little cab fare.

51:27.197 --> 51:29.893
That... that won't hurt. Hey, baby.

51:30.968 --> 51:33.163
I can explain this. It's...

51:33.237 --> 51:36.331
- Gail, that's my wife, Toni.
- Hi.

51:37.408 --> 51:39.000
- Thank you.
- It's OK, really.

51:39.076 --> 51:43.809
- Walter, I'll talk to you later, OK? Thanks.
- Bye-bye.

51:43.881 --> 51:45.872
What the hell's going on here, Walter?

51:45.949 --> 51:49.476
You don't seriously think
I had something to do with that girl, now?

51:49.553 --> 51:53.649
I just brought her up here to pay her off.
I got her for John. Come on.

51:53.724 --> 51:55.817
- Don't bullshit me, Walter.
- Oh, no.

51:55.893 --> 51:59.226
You can't be serious.
You think I slept with this girl?

51:59.296 --> 52:02.857
- Who the hell's John? Who's John?
- John. John Anthony. Ring a bell?

52:02.933 --> 52:04.867
You got Brandon a hooker?

52:04.935 --> 52:10.567
He's working late, he's in a new city,
he has no friends. Yes, I got him a hooker.

52:10.641 --> 52:12.905
Are we gonna have this conversation?

52:12.976 --> 52:16.309
Are you completely,
completely clueless, Walter?

52:16.380 --> 52:18.905
- Why are you so angry?
- Why am I so angry?

52:18.982 --> 52:23.043
Look at you.
You're jealous. Look at you.

52:23.120 --> 52:28.217
- Oh, God. Jealous of what? Of what?
- I don't know. Brandon getting laid.

52:28.292 --> 52:32.126
You really are crazy.
'Cause that sick thought never entered my mind.

52:32.196 --> 52:35.359
Oh, that's not where those thoughts enter.

52:35.432 --> 52:37.627
OK, I'm done. I'm done. That's it.

52:38.202 --> 52:43.196
You'll be happy to know, he didn't
sleep with her. I just paid her for coming.

52:43.273 --> 52:45.707
- Pardon the pun.
- Oh, you're hysterical.

52:45.776 --> 52:47.744
- Daddy!
- Oh!

52:47.811 --> 52:49.574
- Daddy!
- Where's my baby?

52:49.646 --> 52:51.637
Look at her! Look at her! Look at her!

52:52.349 --> 52:57.514
(man) Coming up, week-seven predictions
with our new star John Anthony,

52:57.588 --> 53:01.649
who went an amazing 24 and six
in last weekend's games.

53:02.726 --> 53:04.455
- Jerry.
- Yeah.

53:04.528 --> 53:06.962
John's up first tonight.

53:07.865 --> 53:11.392
- What?
- John Anthony is leading off tonight.

53:11.468 --> 53:14.801
- John Anthony's leading off?
- Is there an echo in here?

53:14.872 --> 53:18.137
Engineer! Sound!
Help me, I'm hearing everything twice.

53:18.208 --> 53:21.974
Two years I lead off and you bury me
in the deck over a couple lousy weekends?

53:22.045 --> 53:25.242
- This is bullshit, Walter.
- (man)... three, two...

53:25.949 --> 53:28.281
Welcome to week seven.

53:28.752 --> 53:30.811
- (Denny) I'm in the garage.
- Hook it up?

53:30.888 --> 53:33.482
- Yeah. You wanna hear it?
- Man, let me hear it.

53:33.557 --> 53:36.390
- OK.
- (loud rock music)

53:40.097 --> 53:44.033
- It is the bomb.
- Oh, that's what I'm talking about.

53:44.101 --> 53:46.626
That's what I'm talking about, my man.

53:46.703 --> 53:49.194
I'm about to head out.
Everything else cool?

53:49.273 --> 53:51.673
Yeah, sort of. Did Dad reach you?

53:51.742 --> 53:56.042
- Dad? No. Why?
- Must be out of money. He keeps calling.

53:56.113 --> 53:57.944
He saw you on TV and wants to talk.

53:58.015 --> 54:01.507
I gave him your work number, but
he says they won't put him through.

54:01.585 --> 54:04.110
I don't know what that's about.
I'll check into it.

54:04.788 --> 54:06.813
(Toni) Let's walk.
You could use the exercise.

54:06.890 --> 54:10.155
Stop worrying. We're set for life.
We got Jimmy the Greek here.

54:10.227 --> 54:16.325
He makes Nostra-fucking-damus look like
a novelty act. Brandon, to the right.

54:16.400 --> 54:18.027
You love that, don't you?

54:18.101 --> 54:21.002
- Let me ask you a question, Walter.
- Shoot.

54:22.072 --> 54:24.267
Have you been blocking any of my calls?

54:24.341 --> 54:28.072
Of course. You don't need
distractions right now, my boy.

54:28.145 --> 54:32.104
- Lot of crazies out there.
- Does that include my father?

54:33.183 --> 54:36.812
You're asking me,
I'm gonna tell you. Yeah.

54:36.887 --> 54:39.014
You son of a bitch.

54:40.924 --> 54:42.619
How long?

54:42.693 --> 54:44.422
- About two weeks.
- Walter.

54:44.494 --> 54:48.590
Come on. Brandon, would you
have taken the call if I put it through?

54:48.665 --> 54:52.294
That's not the point. That's not the point.

54:52.369 --> 54:56.738
What is the point? I'd like to know.
What's the story with you and your father?

54:56.807 --> 54:59.867
- You tell me. You seem to know.
- Well, I know pieces.

54:59.943 --> 55:02.070
That's about all.

55:02.145 --> 55:06.343
- Hey, man, I was just trying to spare you.
- Who are you gonna spare me from, huh?

55:06.416 --> 55:09.749
He was a drunk, left when I was nine.
I couldn't compete with the bottle.

55:09.820 --> 55:12.550
End of fucking story.
So you won't spare me nothing.

55:12.623 --> 55:17.219
If I want to talk to him, I will.
Spare me. You fuck.

55:17.294 --> 55:19.592
Is that it? Is that all you got?

55:19.663 --> 55:25.192
I will match my dysfunctional childhood
and Toni's against yours any day.

55:25.268 --> 55:30.103
My father - five foot, arms like this.
He had a cock like a Hebrew National.

55:30.173 --> 55:34.507
If I even looked at him the wrong way
he'd smack me like Jake LaMotta.

55:34.578 --> 55:38.378
By the time I was five, he yelled at me
so much I thought my name was asshole.

55:38.448 --> 55:40.313
Broke my nose three times.

55:40.384 --> 55:42.716
Toni, tell him about you. Come on.

55:42.786 --> 55:46.153
- I didn't have a great childhood either.
- Great?

55:46.223 --> 55:48.714
Tell him about the uncle.

55:48.792 --> 55:50.555
Well, I think he gets the idea now.

55:50.627 --> 55:54.757
Come on. Suffice it to say, she was
abused by everybody but the family pet.

55:54.831 --> 55:56.560
OK, Walter, please.

55:56.633 --> 56:00.125
Your father was a drunk.
He was a jerk. So what?

56:00.203 --> 56:03.798
It happens. I'm glad
I blocked those calls. You know why?

56:03.874 --> 56:06.672
You need a new image of a man.
How about me?

56:09.479 --> 56:12.971
- She's laughing.
- 'Cause that's a scary fucking thought.

56:13.050 --> 56:14.847
Hey, Brandon, listen to me, man.

56:14.918 --> 56:18.479
The shit that happened to you,
to me, to Toni, you know what that is?

56:18.555 --> 56:20.682
It's just that, shit that happened,

56:20.757 --> 56:24.158
because after the therapy
and the psychiatry

56:24.227 --> 56:26.923
and the meetings,
you know what it all comes down to?

56:26.997 --> 56:29.158
We're all fucked up.

56:29.232 --> 56:31.700
We are alljust so fucked up.

56:32.235 --> 56:34.294
Now, you gotta just say that shit out.

56:34.371 --> 56:37.169
"I am fucked up
and I ain't gonna take it anymore."

56:37.240 --> 56:40.971
Come on. You too, Toni. Let's do it.
All of us. Wallow with me here a minute.

56:41.044 --> 56:44.775
We are so fucked up,
we're not gonna take it anymore.

56:44.848 --> 56:48.340
I am so fucked up with all of you

56:48.418 --> 56:50.682
that I'm not gonna take it anymore.

56:50.754 --> 56:52.221
How's that?

56:52.289 --> 56:55.622
Hey! I'm trying to sleep here, asshole.

56:55.692 --> 56:57.785
- That you, Dad?
- OK, Walter.

56:57.861 --> 56:59.795
I'm gonna kick your fucking head in.

56:59.863 --> 57:02.024
- Let's go.
- Don't wait up.

57:03.433 --> 57:05.867
Amir, you've got to be kidding me, huh?

57:05.936 --> 57:10.839
Are you gonna haggle over 50 grand
after the 250,000 I just made you last weekend?

57:10.907 --> 57:15.367
Look, don't get me wrong, John.
50,000 seems slightly steep.

57:15.445 --> 57:18.573
Steep. Amir, let's rewind a second.

57:18.648 --> 57:23.017
First time you call... No cuff.
...you're in a hole the size of the Grand Canyon,

57:23.086 --> 57:25.486
crying about having
to hock your fiancée's ring.

57:25.555 --> 57:29.958
Now, today, you're calling me from
a red, convertible F1 Ferrari, isn't that it?

57:30.026 --> 57:32.893
Right? Candy red?
Yeah, you doing the math?

57:32.963 --> 57:34.931
I am. All right? I'm gonna cut you off.

57:34.998 --> 57:37.296
- Oh, come on, John.
- I'm coming on.

57:37.367 --> 57:40.825
If we keep working together,
I'll charge a 10% aggravation tax.

57:40.904 --> 57:42.895
Get your ass to Western Union tonight.

57:42.973 --> 57:45.737
Wire me 75 grand
and maybe we can kiss and make up.

57:45.809 --> 57:48.073
OK, OK, John. Now, let's...

57:48.145 --> 57:50.045
John Anthony. Talk to me.

57:50.113 --> 57:53.082
- May I please speak to Brandon Lang?
- Mom?

57:53.150 --> 57:56.881
- Hey, honey, is that you?
- (high-pitched voice) Yeah, it's me!

57:56.953 --> 57:59.717
- Are you OK?
- Mom, I have never been better.

57:59.790 --> 58:01.917
I'm kicking ass and taking names.

58:01.992 --> 58:05.359
- Did you get the money that I sent you?
- Yeah. That's why I'm...

58:05.428 --> 58:09.125
I talked to Denny. I'm flying you and him
out here next month, first-class.

58:09.199 --> 58:12.134
I'll put you up at the Plaza.
You'll meet Toni and Walter.

58:12.202 --> 58:14.067
You are gonna love this joint, Ma.

58:14.137 --> 58:19.507
That sounds great, honey.
About the money, all that money, it's-it's too much.

58:19.576 --> 58:21.976
Ma, but it-it-it's not too much!

58:22.045 --> 58:25.412
I made that money. I earned that money,
every fucking cent of it.

58:25.482 --> 58:29.111
- Listen to you.
- Ma, it's just how people talk out here.

58:29.186 --> 58:31.120
Look, no cuff.

58:31.188 --> 58:33.418
No cuff, Francesco.

58:33.490 --> 58:35.890
Now, who's this John Anthony person?

58:35.959 --> 58:39.986
Those checks I've been sending you,
those checks you've been cashing,

58:40.063 --> 58:41.758
those are from John Anthony.

58:41.832 --> 58:44.995
- And he talks like that?
- Mom, they are from me.

58:45.068 --> 58:47.764
- We gotta go to Puerto Rico.
- I gotta put you on hold.

58:47.838 --> 58:50.238
- What's in Puerto Rico?
- CM Novian called.

58:50.307 --> 58:54.505
He lives in Puerto Rico.
He's the biggest sports bettor in the world.

58:54.578 --> 58:59.106
We've hit the jackpot. He wants to sit
and talk, in person, with John Anthony.

58:59.182 --> 59:02.583
- Got it. How much time we got?
- 45 minutes plane leaves La Guardia.

59:02.652 --> 59:04.950
Whoa, pronto, OK. Mama?

59:05.021 --> 59:07.615
Mom? Ma?

59:10.360 --> 59:12.920
My mom just hung up on me. Um...

59:14.097 --> 59:20.468
- (Brandon) What do you know about him?
- Not much, but he's a world-class prick.

59:20.537 --> 59:24.132
Wouldn't return my call. Treated me
worse than my Hong Kong tailor.

59:24.207 --> 59:26.835
You know how long
I've been trying to bag this guy?

59:26.910 --> 59:29.174
Have you any idea
what this thing is worth?

59:29.246 --> 59:31.976
Nope, but I want a bonus
if we pull this off.

59:32.048 --> 59:35.484
- No "if." It's only "when."
- I got you.

59:35.552 --> 59:38.385
You understand?
Remember, he called us.

59:38.822 --> 59:40.881
- You hooked him.
- Mm-hm.

59:40.957 --> 59:43.983
- Know that. Sweat that.
- You got it.

59:44.060 --> 59:48.520
Relax, my man.
I'll get in character in the car, huh?

59:48.598 --> 59:50.498
Oh, fuck!

59:51.835 --> 59:54.360
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

59:54.437 --> 59:57.736
Hey! Uh-oh. Easy, baby. Easy, easy.

59:57.807 --> 01:00:01.800
Is it your heart?
Where's your vial? Easy, easy.

01:00:01.878 --> 01:00:05.473
Somebody get a doctor! Get me a doctor,
and get me some water now.

01:00:05.548 --> 01:00:08.381
Here we are. Hang on, baby.
Yeah, breathe it out.

01:00:08.818 --> 01:00:12.618
Here's one, two. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you suck on them. Suck on them, man.

01:00:12.689 --> 01:00:14.782
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

01:00:14.858 --> 01:00:17.122
Easy, easy, easy.

01:00:17.193 --> 01:00:18.854
- Yeah, baby.
- Brandon?

01:00:18.929 --> 01:00:20.692
- Yeah? I'm here.
- You love me?

01:00:20.764 --> 01:00:24.791
Shh. Oh, I love you. You know I love you.
Shh. You ain't going nowhere.

01:00:24.868 --> 01:00:29.271
Somebody get some help!
Get me some water now!

01:00:29.339 --> 01:00:30.397
Shh.

01:00:30.473 --> 01:00:34.170
- Brandon?
- Yeah? Talk to me, my man. Come on.

01:00:35.412 --> 01:00:37.243
Would you love me...

01:00:37.314 --> 01:00:40.181
if this was a joke?

01:00:40.884 --> 01:00:42.613
I'm OK.

01:00:43.954 --> 01:00:46.252
I was just practicing. It's OK.

01:00:46.323 --> 01:00:48.450
It's OK.

01:00:48.525 --> 01:00:52.621
Look at me. I'm all right. Oh, I got a crowd.

01:00:52.696 --> 01:00:56.928
Little indigestion.
Too many peanuts on the plane. I'm OK.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.265
Thank you for your concern.
He's had a little problem. Whoa.

01:01:00.337 --> 01:01:03.204
Don't-don't-don't-don't you do that to me.

01:01:04.274 --> 01:01:07.243
- Walter, that's pushing it too far.
- Now, you listen to me.

01:01:07.677 --> 01:01:11.613
Now, you pay attention to me right now.
There's no such thing as too far.

01:01:11.681 --> 01:01:15.242
Understand?
You push everything as far as you can.

01:01:15.318 --> 01:01:18.947
You push and you push and you push
until it starts pushing back

01:01:19.022 --> 01:01:21.149
and then you push some goddamn more.

01:01:21.224 --> 01:01:25.183
Remember that
when you're with this guy today.

01:01:25.261 --> 01:01:26.489
OK?

01:01:27.497 --> 01:01:33.265
Oh, man. If I start to die again,
forget the hospital, I wanna croak here.

01:01:34.304 --> 01:01:39.970
- Walter.
- Mr. Novian, it's an honor. My associate...

01:01:40.043 --> 01:01:42.534
- John Anthony.
- How are you?

01:01:42.612 --> 01:01:45.274
These sports services of yours...

01:01:45.849 --> 01:01:48.943
complete fucking scam, huh?

01:01:51.654 --> 01:01:55.988
I hear your boy here's having quite a season.
What's your system, Walter?

01:01:56.059 --> 01:01:59.586
- System?
- Let's start with how much you bet.

01:01:59.662 --> 01:02:02.096
Million a game, across the board.

01:02:03.133 --> 01:02:05.601
OK, is that the most we're working with?

01:02:05.668 --> 01:02:11.072
It depends. Shit, Benny, check your wallet.
See if you have any cash.

01:02:11.141 --> 01:02:14.167
Maybe he'll talk about the weekend.
How do you feel about it?

01:02:14.244 --> 01:02:17.577
- Do you rent that yacht?
- No, no. I own it.

01:02:17.647 --> 01:02:20.445
Well, that's how I feel about this weekend.

01:02:20.517 --> 01:02:24.578
And I'm not being cocky. I'm talking
straight commerce with you, Mr. Novian.

01:02:24.654 --> 01:02:28.954
- I didn't come down here to bullshit you.
- Wow, you got steamed.

01:02:29.025 --> 01:02:31.858
Or maybe
a little inside information, maybe?

01:02:33.496 --> 01:02:36.260
I know these teams
better than they know themselves.

01:02:36.332 --> 01:02:39.859
I'm going 12 for 12 this weekend
including the Monday-night parlay.

01:02:39.936 --> 01:02:43.099
Wow. Should we believe him?

01:02:43.173 --> 01:02:45.471
- What do you think?
- I don't believe him.

01:02:45.542 --> 01:02:47.772
You cannot afford not to.

01:02:47.844 --> 01:02:50.642
- No, I can afford.
- Can you?

01:02:51.214 --> 01:02:54.115
Honest question, Mr. Novian. Can you?

01:02:54.184 --> 01:02:56.379
Hell, can anyone, for that matter,

01:02:56.453 --> 01:03:00.355
afford to lose as much
as a man like you needs to bet

01:03:00.423 --> 01:03:02.721
to actually feel a win?

01:03:05.428 --> 01:03:06.986
Winning's a funny thing.

01:03:07.063 --> 01:03:12.126
It's one of those rare commodities
that money cannot buy, until you called me.

01:03:12.202 --> 01:03:15.660
I didn't call you. I called your boss.

01:03:15.738 --> 01:03:17.797
And he called me.

01:03:17.874 --> 01:03:23.835
The price is $250,000 up-front,
plus 10% of every game you win.

01:03:23.913 --> 01:03:26.575
Well, that's wild.

01:03:29.752 --> 01:03:31.845
I never paid up-front before, did I?

01:03:31.921 --> 01:03:33.752
We've never charged it before.

01:03:33.823 --> 01:03:38.260
Considering whose picks you're getting,
and the amount of money you're betting,

01:03:38.328 --> 01:03:41.161
250's a bargain. You know it and I know it.

01:03:41.231 --> 01:03:45.930
If you want this weekend's winners,
that's my offer.

01:03:46.002 --> 01:03:49.529
You can take it or leave it.

01:03:53.676 --> 01:03:56.304
Let's step outside.

01:04:03.419 --> 01:04:04.716
(knock at door)

01:04:04.988 --> 01:04:06.546
Come in.

01:04:07.624 --> 01:04:11.082
- They need it, Mr. Anthony.
- What's your mother's name, Mitchell?

01:04:11.161 --> 01:04:12.253
Sheila.

01:04:12.328 --> 01:04:15.092
- What street did you grow up on?
- Atlantic Avenue.

01:04:15.165 --> 01:04:18.066
- Who do you like Monday night?
- Oh, I don't know.

01:04:18.134 --> 01:04:20.625
- Pick one.
- Well, that's your job.

01:04:20.703 --> 01:04:24.366
I'll do your job tomorrow.
Today you do mine. Who do you like?

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:27.034
- What are you talking about?
- Mitchie.

01:04:27.110 --> 01:04:31.604
Seattle v New Orleans.
Stop stalling. Who do you like?

01:04:32.849 --> 01:04:38.651
I don't know. I mean,
I guess I like Seattle, plus the two points.

01:04:38.721 --> 01:04:42.157
- Over or under?
- No, you can't... Don't... You can't do that.

01:04:42.225 --> 01:04:46.628
No, I can do this.
Over or under? It's 44 points. Come on.

01:04:46.696 --> 01:04:49.221
Um...

01:04:49.299 --> 01:04:51.096
Over.

01:04:51.167 --> 01:04:53.635
Seattle in the over. Nice.

01:04:53.703 --> 01:04:56.831
I won't hand that in.
A million dollars are riding on that game.

01:04:56.906 --> 01:04:59.568
Oh, there's a whole lot more than that.

01:04:59.642 --> 01:05:04.306
We all know I can pick. Today I'm picking you.
The outcome will be the same.

01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:09.977
- OK. And... what if I'm wrong?
- There's no "if."

01:05:11.087 --> 01:05:14.579
(Walter) Are we running to the field goal?
We don't need a field goal.

01:05:14.657 --> 01:05:16.648
We need a touchdown.

01:05:16.726 --> 01:05:19.160
Oh, that's OK. That's OK.

01:05:19.229 --> 01:05:21.493
They score, we win. Come on, come on.

01:05:21.564 --> 01:05:23.794
They score, we win. They score, we win.

01:05:24.033 --> 01:05:26.866
They score, we win. They score, we win.

01:05:26.936 --> 01:05:28.631
They score, we win.

01:05:28.705 --> 01:05:31.674
(commentator)... first down on the sixth.
Touchdown!

01:05:31.741 --> 01:05:35.802
Yes! We won! We won!
A hundred fucking percent!

01:05:37.447 --> 01:05:39.779
A hundred fucking percent!

01:05:39.849 --> 01:05:42.875
A hundred fucking percent! A hundred...

(# "It's Not Unusual" by Tom Jones)

01:05:47.590 --> 01:05:49.649
It was like he mesmerized me a little bit.

01:05:49.726 --> 01:05:53.958
Like Spock or something, I visualized it.
Seattle and the over and he wrote it down.

01:05:54.030 --> 01:05:57.488
- He said picking me was like him doing it.
- How long have you been here?

01:05:59.669 --> 01:06:03.366
# It's not unusual to go out at any time

01:06:03.439 --> 01:06:06.704
Congratulations, Brandon,
or should I say John?

01:06:06.776 --> 01:06:09.267
Either way, it's amazing.
I am very impressed.

01:06:09.345 --> 01:06:13.213
Are you kidding me? Letting salesmen
make your picks? That's balls.

01:06:13.283 --> 01:06:16.650
You better get over there and
collect some of that cash right now.

01:06:16.719 --> 01:06:19.654
The way you're picking,
you'll need some for a rainy day.

01:06:19.722 --> 01:06:22.020
(Jerry) Enjoy it while it lasts.

01:06:22.091 --> 01:06:26.255
Gambling gods are a fickle bunch.
So easily offended.

01:06:26.329 --> 01:06:30.857
There might be businesses you can make
over two million dollars in a weekend...

01:06:30.933 --> 01:06:33.401
- Thanks for looking after me.
- All right.

01:06:33.469 --> 01:06:36.734
...but will somebody tell me,
somebody please tell me,

01:06:36.806 --> 01:06:40.902
where else are you gonna
have this much fucking fun?

01:06:41.144 --> 01:06:44.204
You the man! You the man, big Papa!

01:06:44.881 --> 01:06:48.112
I love you forever.

01:06:48.184 --> 01:06:52.621
Let me ask you something.
How much of that do-re-mi be for moi?

01:06:52.689 --> 01:06:58.025
Well, how about a one
with five zeros behind it.

01:06:58.094 --> 01:07:00.119
- A hundred thousand?
- Yeah.

01:07:00.196 --> 01:07:01.823
On two mill?

01:07:01.898 --> 01:07:04.662
- You be working out of my shop.
- Yes, sir, I am.

01:07:04.734 --> 01:07:07.760
- Look around you.
- This is your place, Walter's shop.

01:07:07.837 --> 01:07:11.034
I understand that.
I'm just saying, feed the horse, baby.

01:07:11.107 --> 01:07:13.769
- Maybe 10%.
- 10%?

01:07:13.843 --> 01:07:17.870
That what you're thinking?
That's a beautiful thought. Forget it.

01:07:17.947 --> 01:07:23.408
Walter, we were starting to roll here.
And we got Novian. We got the 250 grand...

01:07:23.486 --> 01:07:26.580
I wanna tell you something now, OK?
I'm gonna say it only once.

01:07:26.656 --> 01:07:30.683
If you want something more from me
than a gesundheit after a sneeze,

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:32.557
you have to do more than this shit.

01:07:32.628 --> 01:07:35.062
You understand?
You're gonna have to earn it.

01:07:35.131 --> 01:07:37.565
Once you earn it,
you'll have to fight me for it.

01:07:37.633 --> 01:07:42.400
You'll have to challenge me.
You'll have to rip it out of my fucking talons.

01:07:42.472 --> 01:07:47.068
That's how you get ahead with me.
Now, John Anthony would know that, see?

01:07:47.143 --> 01:07:50.408
As a matter of fact,
next time you come to me with this shit,

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:52.311
you come as John Anthony.

01:07:52.382 --> 01:07:54.509
I ain't talking money with you.

- You do.

Stop that.

Why don't we go down and check it out?

01:08:46.068 --> 01:08:50.004

That shit's over.

It's never over.
You know that, Walter. It's never over.

01:09:05.587 --> 01:09:08.488
How about a truth serum... in the veins?

Yeah. Yeah, listen,

You have got a Doberman for a doorman.

01:09:39.721 --> 01:09:44.283
- Hi, Alexandria.
- What are you doing here?

01:09:44.359 --> 01:09:48.854
What do you say we go out
for a late-night dinner right now?

I live in this building, asshole. This is home.

01:10:00.209 --> 01:10:02.939
I don't appreciate
you stopping by without calling.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

# The world still is the same

01:10:20.897 --> 01:10:22.990
# You never change it

# As sure as the stars shine above

01:10:31.807 --> 01:10:33.866
# Well, you're nobody

Wrong. It's time to press, my man.

I've got a 10:30 tee time at Wingfoot
with a client - that Howell guy.

01:11:08.077 --> 01:11:10.307
So don't call me unless the lines change.

01:11:10.379 --> 01:11:15.681
The salmon are running, my man.
You gotta stay here. Gotta field phone calls.

01:11:15.751 --> 01:11:17.946
You can't go out playing golf, having fun.

01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:20.818
Fun? Señor, you have obviously
never played Wingfoot.

01:11:20.890 --> 01:11:24.917
Come on, stop playing around here.
Let's go. You got work to do this week.

01:11:24.994 --> 01:11:29.897
I'm not asking you if I can leave, Walter.
I'm telling you that's how it is. All right?

01:11:30.866 --> 01:11:33.130
You want my picks, I can give you those.

01:11:33.202 --> 01:11:36.535

01:11:43.179 --> 01:11:46.342
Philadelphia. I love it. Look at that. Cinci.

01:11:47.383 --> 01:11:52.082
We'll be advising in the neighborhood
of 20 million dollars this week.

01:11:52.154 --> 01:11:56.113
That's a nice neighborhood.
We should be doing double that by week ten.

01:11:56.192 --> 01:11:59.491
I see. You're gonna make the picks.
No study, no analysis.

01:11:59.562 --> 01:12:01.553
You're just gonna pick 'em.

01:12:01.631 --> 01:12:03.826
Locked in, Walter. I don't really need it.

01:12:03.899 --> 01:12:07.335
Look at that. You've got to be kidding me.
Vegas, Monday night.

01:12:07.403 --> 01:12:09.098
There's my picks for this week.

01:12:09.171 --> 01:12:13.369
Now, if you want next week's picks,
I can give you those by Friday.

01:12:13.442 --> 01:12:16.434
- If you wanna join us, you can.
- No, I'm getting the drift.

01:12:16.512 --> 01:12:19.913
Tell you what. We'll keep these on ice
and go over 'em tomorrow.

01:12:19.982 --> 01:12:22.507
- I won't be in tomorrow.
- Well, then, the next day!

01:12:22.585 --> 01:12:25.577
(Brandon) Uh, we'll talk about it.

01:12:27.256 --> 01:12:29.121
(Toni) Hey, Brandon!

01:12:29.191 --> 01:12:31.159
- Toni!
- Hey!

01:12:31.227 --> 01:12:33.627
- Where you headed?
- Some of us have to work.

01:12:33.696 --> 01:12:37.029
- Oh, oh, oh. There we go.
- Baby.

01:12:37.099 --> 01:12:40.068
- Hey, you look great.
- Nice ride.

01:12:40.136 --> 01:12:43.731
- "900 K-l-N-G." Did you see the plates?
- Yes, I did.

01:12:51.714 --> 01:12:53.875
(horns honk)

01:12:55.518 --> 01:12:58.919
- You feel that? You feel that?
- Don't. Slow down, Brandon.

01:12:58.988 --> 01:13:02.947
- Oh, this car was made to go fast.
- No. Not with me in it. Slow down.

01:13:03.025 --> 01:13:04.925
Loosen up, will you? Hey.

01:13:06.195 --> 01:13:07.924
Let me ask you a question.

01:13:07.997 --> 01:13:11.125
When you're not at the salon,
or running Julia to play dates,

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:16.695
or keeping Walter in line, which I know
is a full-time job, what do you do for you?

01:13:16.772 --> 01:13:20.731
- I stay busy. You're gonna turn here, so...
- That's not what I asked.

01:13:22.211 --> 01:13:25.476
What do you do for you, for Toni?

01:13:27.483 --> 01:13:30.975
I was a junkie, Brandon. OK?

01:13:31.053 --> 01:13:33.851
So every day I get up and I wonder,
"Is this the day?

01:13:33.923 --> 01:13:38.121
"Is this the day I slip,
end up back on the street?"

01:13:38.194 --> 01:13:41.994
Just keeping it all on track,
that's what I do for me.

01:13:42.064 --> 01:13:45.192
Well, that's not living, Toni.
That is not living.

01:13:45.267 --> 01:13:49.328
That is maintaining.
That's cashing in. That is not living.

01:13:50.039 --> 01:13:51.734
What the hell does that mean?

01:13:51.807 --> 01:13:55.106
Are we talking perfection?
You wanna talk perfection?

01:13:55.177 --> 01:13:57.372
No. Nobody's perfect.

01:13:57.446 --> 01:14:01.974
Oh, except for me last weekend,
going 14 and 0, huh?

01:14:07.223 --> 01:14:11.717
- This is your stop.
- Well, thanks for the ride... John.

01:14:20.436 --> 01:14:24.031
In other action, Washington melted down
in Miami, losing 24 to 12.

01:14:24.106 --> 01:14:26.438
Saint-Louis shocked KC 34-14,

01:14:26.509 --> 01:14:30.605
and Philadelphia
smacked Pittsburgh 23-10.

01:14:30.679 --> 01:14:33.307
- I'm gonna go work out.
- No, you're not.

01:14:33.382 --> 01:14:35.543
There's half a dozen games left here.

01:14:35.618 --> 01:14:40.351
I want you to watch every second
of every minute of every one of them.

01:14:40.422 --> 01:14:42.083
All right, so sit down.

01:14:42.158 --> 01:14:44.490
(commentator)
Oakland is having a miserable time.

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:47.085
Berman.

01:14:47.596 --> 01:14:51.032
You know how you go
three and 11, don't you?

01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:55.093
You go three and 11 when
you make Sunday's picks on Tuesday.

01:14:55.171 --> 01:14:58.004
'Cause it rained in Cincinnati on Saturday.

01:14:58.073 --> 01:15:01.133
Two starting quarterbacks
never got to play.

01:15:01.210 --> 01:15:04.611
That's how you go three and 11.
You're a handicapper, not a psychic.

01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:08.013
- We still got Monday and the parlay.
- Fuck Monday and the parlay.

01:15:08.083 --> 01:15:11.883
This isn't about that. This is about me.
It's about the commission thing.

01:15:11.954 --> 01:15:15.287
- Oh, no. I don't know.
- Oh, don't bullshit me. Come on.

01:15:15.357 --> 01:15:19.384
All right, listen.
I'm gonna bump you. 10%. OK?

01:15:19.461 --> 01:15:21.622
You earned it.

01:15:21.697 --> 01:15:26.964
This is dangerous territory we're getting into.
You understand? But I'll bump you.

01:15:27.036 --> 01:15:29.368
Now, talk to me about Monday night,

01:15:29.438 --> 01:15:33.738
because everyone, I mean everyone,
will double down after the hole you put 'em in.

01:15:33.809 --> 01:15:36.073
- It's fine.
- You'd bet your mother's house?

01:15:36.145 --> 01:15:38.204
- I don't bet, Walter.
- If you did?

01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:41.613
- I like the pick, Walter.
- On your mother's house or not?

01:15:41.684 --> 01:15:43.481
With my mother in it.

01:15:43.552 --> 01:15:47.613
(commentator) Another Monday-night
thriller comes down to the final seconds.

01:15:47.690 --> 01:15:50.659
Carolina has to get at least
into field-goal range here.

01:15:50.726 --> 01:15:52.591
High snap, pulled down nicely.

01:15:52.661 --> 01:15:54.925
And a beautiful punt by Feuderday.

01:15:54.997 --> 01:15:57.431
He drills it. Thompson has to retreat.

01:15:57.499 --> 01:16:01.435
And Thompson dropped the ball. The ball
is on the turf, and the scramble is on.

01:16:01.503 --> 01:16:03.869
It's heading toward the Carolina goal line.

01:16:03.939 --> 01:16:07.636
A couple of guysjump on it.
It might be changing hands right now.

01:16:07.710 --> 01:16:09.371
Fuck!

01:16:09.445 --> 01:16:13.142
(commentator) The call goes to Cleveland.
Carolina won't have a shot...

01:16:13.215 --> 01:16:15.342
- Fuck!
- (phone rings)

01:16:15.417 --> 01:16:21.151
(commentator) This one is over.
An unbelievable finish.

01:16:23.692 --> 01:16:28.220
(Brandon) You don't switch to
a three-four halfway through the season.

01:16:28.297 --> 01:16:30.697
No, what defense
are they running in practice?

01:16:30.766 --> 01:16:34.395
Jones is on the field. Sunday.
We're still leaning heavy on the overs.

01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:36.097
Thank you, thank you, sir.

01:16:36.171 --> 01:16:38.002
You are the man. I'll talk to you...

01:16:38.073 --> 01:16:43.409
His improvement's been great, but he got
out of surgery two and half weeks ago.

01:16:43.479 --> 01:16:46.880
I know he's had a good week of practice,
but his knee's swollen.

01:16:46.949 --> 01:16:50.248
Help me out. Game-time decision.
That's what coach always says.

01:16:50.319 --> 01:16:54.551
Are we talking game-time probable, huh?
Or doubtful?

01:16:54.623 --> 01:16:57.888
Tell me. You're going into...
It's raining, it's snowing.

01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:00.326
Can his knee hold up in that?

01:17:00.396 --> 01:17:02.887
Will the doc let him play?

01:17:02.965 --> 01:17:05.433
Yes, he is a gamer. Thank you.

01:17:05.501 --> 01:17:08.334
I can read between the lines. You got it.

01:17:08.404 --> 01:17:11.237
(commentator) Unbelievable! Yee-ha!

01:17:12.308 --> 01:17:14.776
(commentator#2)
Takes the snap, drops the throw.

01:17:22.518 --> 01:17:24.748
(Walter) Whoa!

01:17:25.821 --> 01:17:27.550
Hell of a swing.

01:17:29.992 --> 01:17:32.119
Sport of kings, right?

01:17:32.194 --> 01:17:35.527
- No, no. That's horse racing.
- What are you doing here?

01:17:35.597 --> 01:17:39.124
- Southie told me where I could find you.
- Yep.

01:17:39.201 --> 01:17:41.931
I wanted to get out. Clear my head.

01:17:42.004 --> 01:17:45.098
So talk to me. How'd we do?

01:17:45.174 --> 01:17:48.109
- You haven't seen the scores?
- Nope.

01:17:48.177 --> 01:17:53.205
That's how I wanted it.
Make my picks, get the results later.

01:17:54.950 --> 01:17:59.614
- Well... highest sales volume ever.
- Yeah?

01:17:59.688 --> 01:18:03.590
- Take a guess how we did.
- I think we kicked ass.

01:18:04.593 --> 01:18:08.620
- It was amazing.
- Yeah, last week was nothing, Walter.

01:18:10.132 --> 01:18:15.502
You're right. It was nothing
compared to what we lost today.

01:18:17.339 --> 01:18:18.499
What'd I go?

01:18:19.808 --> 01:18:23.244
I got an idea. Why don't I give you
a glimpse of what happened,

01:18:23.312 --> 01:18:26.577
and then you take a stab
on how you went?

01:18:26.648 --> 01:18:28.309
Just give me the numbers.

01:18:28.384 --> 01:18:31.319
You don't wanna play?
Too bad. Would've been fun.

01:18:31.387 --> 01:18:33.446
Grown men crying on the phone.

01:18:33.522 --> 01:18:35.752
Their wives screaming in the background.

01:18:35.824 --> 01:18:38.759
Three salespeople quit -
couldn't take the pressure.

01:18:38.827 --> 01:18:41.557
- Fuck.
- No, no, no.

01:18:41.630 --> 01:18:45.259
You lose ten out of 12,
"fuck" doesn't quite cover it.

01:18:45.334 --> 01:18:48.770
You know what would be more appropriate?
"Holy Fucking Shit!"

01:18:48.837 --> 01:18:53.001
Or "Jesus Fucking Christ!"

01:18:53.542 --> 01:18:56.443
- I got the picture, Walter.
- You're right.

01:18:56.512 --> 01:19:00.346
You go two for 12
on our highest volume weekend ever,

01:19:00.416 --> 01:19:02.714
and...

01:19:02.785 --> 01:19:04.650
what's left to say?

01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:07.689
Except maybe
we keep the phone number,

01:19:07.756 --> 01:19:10.782
only we switch it over
to a fucking suicide hotline.

01:19:10.859 --> 01:19:14.454
Tomorrow morning, Brandon,
bright and early,

01:19:14.530 --> 01:19:17.397
we start all over again.

01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:37.646
- Mr. Novian wants to see you.
- Argh!

01:19:38.587 --> 01:19:41.556
Tell him... to call me. Argh!

01:19:41.623 --> 01:19:43.955
You tell him.

01:19:44.026 --> 01:19:48.588
- I didn't recognize you without the suit.
- This is my time off.

01:19:48.664 --> 01:19:51.132
If you want to talk, make an appointment.

01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:53.998
Or should I call you Brandon?

01:19:55.037 --> 01:19:57.904
Someone costs you 30 mill,
you do research, right?

01:19:57.973 --> 01:19:59.907
I mean, I got more than your name now.

01:19:59.975 --> 01:20:03.934
I know where you live, where you're from,
where your family lives.

01:20:04.012 --> 01:20:06.947
Hey, your mother,
there's a sweet lady, man.

01:20:07.015 --> 01:20:12.180
I just come from Vegas. Dealt me
three blackjacks in a row. She's a good woman.

01:20:13.622 --> 01:20:17.888
Where's the cocky motherfucker
who come to my house? Where's John?

01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:21.088
If you don't like my picks,
use somebody else.

01:20:25.701 --> 01:20:29.262
Come here. It's all right. It's all right.

01:20:30.339 --> 01:20:35.743
I just come for an apology. That's it.
Just look me in the eye and say you're sorry.

01:20:35.811 --> 01:20:39.838
I mean, say it so as to make me
believe you mean it. Come on.

01:20:39.915 --> 01:20:42.611
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck that. I'm not going to accept that.

01:20:42.684 --> 01:20:45.710
Come on, one more time. I'm sorry. Hey?

01:20:47.456 --> 01:20:50.619
- I'm sorry.
- You motherfucker. You're not even close.

01:20:50.692 --> 01:20:53.217
You're not even close.

01:20:53.295 --> 01:20:56.423
No, it's not gonna work.
It's not gonna work.

01:20:56.498 --> 01:20:59.695
I'm gonna get my satisfaction.
I'm gonna get something I want.

01:20:59.768 --> 01:21:02.066
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no.
No-no-no.

01:21:02.137 --> 01:21:04.196
What do you mean, "No-no-no"?

01:21:04.273 --> 01:21:07.367
No, look. I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

01:21:07.442 --> 01:21:09.342
- Brandon?
- OK.

01:21:09.945 --> 01:21:10.934
I'm sorry.

01:21:11.013 --> 01:21:14.312
Come on, you're not gonna tell me
you're scared of dying, are you?

01:21:14.383 --> 01:21:16.613
Mr. Novian, it was a bad fucking weekend.

01:21:16.685 --> 01:21:19.085
- It was a bad weekend?
- Yeah, yeah. Yes, yes.

01:21:19.521 --> 01:21:22.786
Well let's make it a fun day.

01:21:22.858 --> 01:21:24.689
Come here.

01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:26.455
Oh, yeah.

01:21:27.095 --> 01:21:28.995
Yeah. Yeah.

01:21:29.064 --> 01:21:30.793
- Come here.
- Argh!

01:21:30.866 --> 01:21:32.663
There.

01:21:33.135 --> 01:21:35.262
(laughter)

01:21:38.006 --> 01:21:39.564
- Walter.
- I'm busy.

01:21:39.641 --> 01:21:44.135
Listen, I think I should lead off tonight.
I got some really strong stuff, man.

01:21:44.213 --> 01:21:46.545
Jerry, you got a good hole. Stay in it.

01:21:46.615 --> 01:21:49.607
I went eight for 12 last week.
I'm hot. I'm feeling it.

01:21:49.685 --> 01:21:51.550
You had one good weekend.

01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:54.817
What do you mean?
SYKES system revolutionized this industry.

01:21:54.890 --> 01:21:57.324
Am I wood?

01:21:57.392 --> 01:22:01.260
Where's my fucking ad? I...

01:22:01.330 --> 01:22:03.161
- Take a hike.
- What?

01:22:03.232 --> 01:22:05.257
- You're fired.
- I'm not fired.

01:22:05.334 --> 01:22:07.325
- You're out of here.
- You need me.

01:22:07.402 --> 01:22:10.269
Get outta here, you cut-rate parasite.

01:22:10.339 --> 01:22:12.364
In six years, my worst weekend

01:22:12.441 --> 01:22:15.968
was never as bad
as any of this guy's last three weeks.

01:22:16.044 --> 01:22:20.071
You're not hearing me.
You don't work for me anymore. It's over.

01:22:20.148 --> 01:22:22.343
- What the hell are you doing, Walter?
- Oh!

01:22:22.417 --> 01:22:25.716
Am I doing something wrong?
Am I not communicating? Is that it?

01:22:25.787 --> 01:22:30.053
Am I not projecting enough?
He doesn't understand. You all know what I just did.

01:22:30.125 --> 01:22:33.117
- I fired you!
- Come on, this is me! All right?

01:22:33.195 --> 01:22:37.188
I've been here for you. I'm consistent
and you know it. The other guys, fuck 'em.

01:22:37.266 --> 01:22:41.498
- They come, they go. I'm the guy.
- No, they don't. Not him.

01:22:41.570 --> 01:22:44.038
That's true talent! Get it?

01:22:44.106 --> 01:22:48.270
You can't see it, I can't explain it to you.
That's why you're fired.

01:22:48.343 --> 01:22:50.208
Think about what you're doing.

01:22:50.279 --> 01:22:54.045
You couldn't pick your nose without
a fucking computer. You're small.

01:22:54.116 --> 01:22:56.550
- You belong in a can.
- You've lost it!

01:22:56.618 --> 01:22:58.711
You don't touch him.

01:22:58.787 --> 01:23:03.224
Now, why don't you have
some self-respect and leave?

01:23:07.262 --> 01:23:10.425
- You're out of your fucking mind.
- Maybe I am.

01:23:10.499 --> 01:23:12.831
Maybe I am.

01:23:12.901 --> 01:23:15.267
Good luck!

01:23:18.307 --> 01:23:20.207
Asshole.

01:23:20.275 --> 01:23:23.711
Doesn't realize I'm trying
to build an empire around you.

01:23:23.779 --> 01:23:26.145
I hope you do.

01:23:26.214 --> 01:23:30.583
OK, everyone. Let's go. Back to work.
Big playoff weekend coming. Chop-chop.

01:23:33.488 --> 01:23:35.649
(phone rings)

01:23:43.198 --> 01:23:45.223
(knock at door)

01:24:03.418 --> 01:24:05.352
Hey, Toni. This is not a good time.

01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:09.516
I know, but, Brandon,
I need to talk to you. It's important.

01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:16.263
- Not right now.
- Brandon, you have to... you have to go.

01:24:19.301 --> 01:24:22.395
No, I gotta... get back on track.

01:24:22.471 --> 01:24:24.666
It won't matter.

01:24:24.740 --> 01:24:29.177
You could win 100 games in a row
and it won't be enough. It'll never be enough.

01:24:29.244 --> 01:24:32.372
He will ride you into the ground.

01:24:33.448 --> 01:24:35.507
I'll figure it out.

01:24:35.584 --> 01:24:37.415
No.

01:24:38.954 --> 01:24:41.115
Brandon, please.

01:25:04.246 --> 01:25:06.407
(phone rings)

01:25:11.787 --> 01:25:13.652
John Anthony.

01:25:13.722 --> 01:25:17.055
- (Amir) I'm wiped out, John.
- Amir.

01:25:17.826 --> 01:25:20.158
My business, my house,

01:25:20.228 --> 01:25:23.527
my credit... everything.

01:25:23.598 --> 01:25:25.361
Amir?

01:25:25.434 --> 01:25:30.201
It's gonna be OK, all right?
We're gonna get back on track this weekend.

01:25:30.272 --> 01:25:33.332
- You hear me?
- Still you talk like this.

01:25:33.408 --> 01:25:35.706
Who the fuck are you?

01:25:35.777 --> 01:25:39.543
Like this is some kind of game.
You ruined me!

01:25:39.614 --> 01:25:44.313
I was betting a few thousand a Sunday
when I called you, but you pushed me.

01:25:44.386 --> 01:25:47.355
Every call, all the time, with your talk.

01:25:48.423 --> 01:25:52.018
I lost 380,000 this weekend.

01:25:53.061 --> 01:25:55.621
I was going to get married.

01:25:57.098 --> 01:26:00.033
I had a life!

01:26:00.101 --> 01:26:02.797
(Amir sobs)

01:26:02.871 --> 01:26:04.964
Oh, no words now, huh?

01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:08.134
No more money to squeeze
so you shut up.

01:26:08.577 --> 01:26:12.877
- How do you fucking live with yourself?
- (dial tone)

01:26:19.488 --> 01:26:21.922
Come on.

01:26:32.534 --> 01:26:33.626
That's it!

01:26:33.702 --> 01:26:35.465
Coming, Walter!

01:26:35.537 --> 01:26:38.404
I know what the problem is.

01:26:39.174 --> 01:26:41.039
- He's OK.
- I'll come back later.

01:26:41.109 --> 01:26:42.940
No, no, stick around. Stay, stay.

01:26:43.011 --> 01:26:46.242
These guys are finished.
You guys want anything before you go?

01:26:46.314 --> 01:26:50.273
Something to eat?
You leave the way you came in, fellas. Thank you.

01:26:50.352 --> 01:26:52.684
Shut the door.

01:26:55.156 --> 01:26:58.284
- Who's that?
- We need a Bat Light or something.

01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:02.626
One of them signals you shoot up
into the clouds, so that no matter where you are,

01:27:02.697 --> 01:27:05.257
you just look up, you say,
"Hey, Walter needs me."

01:27:05.333 --> 01:27:08.166
Because I must've beeped you
a hundred fucking times.

01:27:08.236 --> 01:27:11.603
- Who were they, man?
- The Salvation Army.

01:27:11.673 --> 01:27:15.165
How does someone go one for eight?

01:27:15.744 --> 01:27:19.703
A fucking monkey tossing darts
could do better than that.

01:27:19.781 --> 01:27:22.875
- What's with all the money, Walter?
- I got a plan.

01:27:22.951 --> 01:27:25.249
We take your picks,
we reverse everything.

01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:29.051
Like one of them Twilight Zone
episodes where everything is opposite.

01:27:29.124 --> 01:27:31.217
You say black, we go white.

01:27:31.293 --> 01:27:34.751
- How much is that?
- Peanuts.

01:27:34.829 --> 01:27:37.855
275,000. That's how desperate I am.

01:27:37.933 --> 01:27:40.993
- What happened to the two mill?
- Two mill?

01:27:41.069 --> 01:27:45.563
Man, I was carrying twice that in red ink
before you even showed up.

01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:48.370
Look around. Everything you see
is smoke and mirrors.

01:27:48.443 --> 01:27:51.207
I got three mortgages on this house.

01:27:51.279 --> 01:27:55.010
What do you wanna know?
I'm gambling again!

01:27:58.386 --> 01:28:00.684
To cover my losses,
I just got a loan from a guy

01:28:00.755 --> 01:28:03.485
who works out of a bar
on 106th and Broadway.

01:28:03.925 --> 01:28:07.417
Trouble with me is, I start
betting you heavy after you went 100%,

01:28:07.495 --> 01:28:10.794
and I rode you right into the fucking toilet.

01:28:10.865 --> 01:28:15.234
I do know what the problem is, man.
We're gonna take care of all this shit.

01:28:15.303 --> 01:28:17.737
Check this out, man. I'm Brandon Lang.

01:28:17.806 --> 01:28:20.366
I'm the kid who played sports
and loved sports.

01:28:20.442 --> 01:28:23.707
I'm the kid who can pick winners.
I'm the kid you called in Vegas.

01:28:23.778 --> 01:28:26.144
Along the way, I lost something in here.

01:28:26.214 --> 01:28:30.150
I don't know what, but I know I gotta
go back to being me, to being Brandon.

01:28:30.218 --> 01:28:33.847
- If I get back to being Brandon...
- You can pick again. Of course.

01:28:33.922 --> 01:28:37.688
- Forget John Anthony. Burn the suits.
- Mm-hm.

01:28:37.759 --> 01:28:40.626
My fault. I fucked with you.

01:28:41.896 --> 01:28:45.923
- Only two games. Two over-unders.
- That's right.

01:28:46.001 --> 01:28:51.496
If I get you to crunch the numbers,
sprinkle a little Brandon magic over it.

01:28:51.573 --> 01:28:54.337
We get the salespeople
burning up the phones...

01:28:54.409 --> 01:28:57.276
- Come Monday we go four for four.
- Four for four.

01:28:57.345 --> 01:28:59.210
- That's something.
- How's that sound?

01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:03.114
- This is important, you know?
- I know it is. Pressure doesn't help.

01:29:03.184 --> 01:29:05.982
Let's go eat something.
Let's go to Smith and Wo's.

01:29:06.054 --> 01:29:08.386
Brandon's gotta stay
and do some homework.

01:29:08.456 --> 01:29:11.482
The Brandon thing.
You see, I'm forgetting.

01:29:21.136 --> 01:29:23.764
Two games. Two games. Two games.

01:29:27.609 --> 01:29:30.544
Two games. Two games. Two games.

01:29:30.612 --> 01:29:31.943
Hey, what... Ho!

01:29:34.783 --> 01:29:38.310
People living in the zone.
What does that mean?

01:29:48.396 --> 01:29:50.023
His hair was all over.

01:30:14.255 --> 01:30:16.815
Brandon made these picks?

01:30:16.891 --> 01:30:19.155
You're looking at him.

01:30:19.928 --> 01:30:23.295
New York in the under.
Tennessee in the over.

01:30:23.364 --> 01:30:25.764
Sell 'em hard.

01:30:26.234 --> 01:30:29.965
(TV) Hello and welcome. The Conference
Championship game is underway.

01:30:30.038 --> 01:30:33.269
- Can I watch, Daddy?
- Come to Daddy.

01:30:33.341 --> 01:30:35.639
My angel. I need you to root for me.

01:30:35.710 --> 01:30:39.942
You see that team? Those are the bad guys.
We don't want them. That's Atlanta.

01:30:40.014 --> 01:30:42.949
We want the good guys, the blue team.
That's New York.

01:30:43.017 --> 01:30:46.077
And New York has gotta win
by more than five points,

01:30:46.154 --> 01:30:48.645
only you gotta root for a low score, OK?

01:30:48.723 --> 01:30:53.023
Because both teams together
have to make less than 42 points, total.

01:30:53.094 --> 01:30:56.928
All right, so it's New York
in under 42 points.

01:30:56.998 --> 01:30:58.863
All right?

01:30:58.933 --> 01:31:02.960
(commentator) Smith is wide.
Cohn changing the play, audible lies.

01:31:03.037 --> 01:31:05.835
At the line of scrimmage.
He doesn't like the defense.

01:31:05.907 --> 01:31:09.206
Robinson in motion to the left.
Jones alone in the backfield.

01:31:09.277 --> 01:31:12.405
Cohn back to passer. He's got the rookie.

01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:15.005
- Anderson is in the middle...
- Go, go, go!

01:31:15.083 --> 01:31:17.142
- (commentator) In the end zone.
- Yeah!

01:31:17.218 --> 01:31:20.676
(commentator) Touchdown, New York,
and they take the early lead.

01:31:20.755 --> 01:31:22.780
Midway through the second quarter now.

01:31:22.857 --> 01:31:27.089
Atlanta down 10-0, but they're making
their first serious threat of the game.

01:31:27.162 --> 01:31:29.426
- Thomas, delay action...
- Get him!

01:31:29.497 --> 01:31:32.227
(commentator) Over the top.
Touchdown, Atlanta!

01:31:32.300 --> 01:31:36.896
10-7 and New York is on the move.
Cohn now back to throw.

01:31:36.971 --> 01:31:39.235
He's over, he's over, he's over.

01:31:39.307 --> 01:31:42.834
(commentator) Simpson's got it!
He fumbles it. He's in the end zone!

01:31:42.911 --> 01:31:46.847
That's a touchdown!
It's now 17-7 New York.

01:31:46.915 --> 01:31:49.213
- And we'll be right back.
- Whoo!

01:31:49.284 --> 01:31:52.378
(commentator) Less than a minute to go.
New York seconds away

01:31:52.453 --> 01:31:54.717
from making their third trip
to the big game.

01:31:54.789 --> 01:31:59.624
A New York score here and this game
is all but over. He's got Simpson.

01:31:59.694 --> 01:32:02.629
- Touchdown, New York!
- (cheering)

01:32:02.697 --> 01:32:06.633
(commentator)
24-14. Now it is out of reach.

01:32:06.701 --> 01:32:11.104
New York ready to take on the winner
of our next game, KC against Tennessee.

01:32:11.172 --> 01:32:13.868
The boy is back. First of two, baby!

01:32:13.942 --> 01:32:17.070
(commentator)
Atlanta may just take a knee here.

01:32:17.145 --> 01:32:18.806
(man) Way to do it!

01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:22.816
(commentator) Why not throw it long?
He puts it up for grabs. It's a Hail Mary.

01:32:22.884 --> 01:32:26.251
- Knock it down! Knock it down!
- (man) Oh, no.

01:32:26.321 --> 01:32:28.585
(commentator) A wall of blue shirts...

01:32:28.656 --> 01:32:30.681
Come on! No!

01:32:30.758 --> 01:32:35.092
(commentator) It is tipped in the air.
It's still loose. It is bouncing all around.

01:32:35.163 --> 01:32:38.564
- Jesus!
- (commentator) Peterson comes down.

01:32:38.633 --> 01:32:41.830
- He's at the 20.
- (man) Come on!

01:32:41.903 --> 01:32:46.738
(commentator) Across the ten. Mackey
dives to keep him out of the end zone.

01:32:46.808 --> 01:32:48.605
(Walter) No!

01:32:48.676 --> 01:32:52.077
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

01:32:52.146 --> 01:32:54.979
(commentator) New York wins it 24-21.

01:33:04.359 --> 01:33:07.260
(TV) That wraps up
our doubleheader playoff coverage,

01:33:07.328 --> 01:33:10.786
as Kansas City tops Tennessee 33 to 13

01:33:10.865 --> 01:33:14.062
and heads for Super Forty.

01:33:14.135 --> 01:33:16.603
I'm finished, Walter.

01:33:17.672 --> 01:33:19.697
Oh, that's great to hear.

01:33:19.774 --> 01:33:21.674
Yeah.

01:33:21.743 --> 01:33:23.973
- I'm done, man.
- Yeah?

01:33:24.045 --> 01:33:26.013
I don't eat.

01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:28.571
I'm not sleeping.

01:33:28.650 --> 01:33:32.279
What you saying? You got insomnia,
indigestion, you're gonna quit?

01:33:32.353 --> 01:33:34.753
Hail Mary pass. These things happen.

01:33:34.822 --> 01:33:38.280
Listen to me, man.
I'm telling you. It's over.

01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:43.524
What use is John Anthony
gonna be to you now anyway, huh?

01:33:43.598 --> 01:33:45.623
With the streak he's been on?

01:33:45.700 --> 01:33:48.396
Come on.
I won't listen to this defeatist bullshit.

01:33:48.469 --> 01:33:51.370
Hot streaks go cold. Cold streaks go hot.

01:33:51.439 --> 01:33:55.398
They know you went 80%
for half a season. They know.

01:33:55.476 --> 01:33:58.070
They're gonna remember
as soon as you win a game.

01:33:58.146 --> 01:34:00.546
Then we go into
March Madness, baseball.

01:34:00.615 --> 01:34:02.583
Next year, this won't even be a memory.

01:34:02.650 --> 01:34:05.141
Who said anything about next year, Walter?

01:34:05.219 --> 01:34:09.622
You made a career choice, buddy,
and I bankrolled it.

01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:13.957
Mm-hm.

01:34:16.664 --> 01:34:18.154
OK?

01:34:18.232 --> 01:34:21.099
- Let him go.
- Let him go?

01:34:22.704 --> 01:34:25.468
Of course you stick up for him. Of course.

01:34:25.540 --> 01:34:27.838
Oh, Walter.

01:34:27.909 --> 01:34:30.878
- Meaning what?
- I don't know. Meaning what?

01:34:30.945 --> 01:34:33.675
Meaning whose side are you on?

01:34:36.351 --> 01:34:39.411
I didn't realize I had to choose, Walter.

01:34:41.422 --> 01:34:42.946
Brandon.

01:34:43.024 --> 01:34:48.428
You're a champion. A champion
goes down 86 times, he's up on the 87th.

01:34:48.496 --> 01:34:50.794
I'm not gonna let you stay down. No way.

01:34:50.865 --> 01:34:54.801
Because this is not about you. Or you.

01:34:54.869 --> 01:34:57.770
Or me. It's about your gift.

01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:01.604
Your gift transcends all this shit.

01:35:01.676 --> 01:35:05.043
Your gift is cosmic. It's metaphysic.

01:35:05.113 --> 01:35:08.105
It's eternal. It is God!

01:35:09.717 --> 01:35:12.151
Besides, we have a contract.

01:35:15.123 --> 01:35:18.490
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit? Bullshit, bullshit.

01:35:19.027 --> 01:35:22.326
- Walter, you can't own someone.
- Who owns him?

01:35:22.397 --> 01:35:25.457
I created the greatest sports tout
this country's seen.

01:35:25.533 --> 01:35:28.093
I hooked him up with every major client.

01:35:28.169 --> 01:35:31.661
I built a fucking
television show around him.

01:35:31.739 --> 01:35:33.934
I took out full-page ads.

01:35:34.008 --> 01:35:37.034
I introduced him
to the major clients of the world.

01:35:37.111 --> 01:35:41.207
I did that.
I hooked you up with everybody.

01:35:41.282 --> 01:35:44.183
Think you're gonna walk out the door,
take that with you,

01:35:44.252 --> 01:35:47.016
leave me here
holding the fucking sack? Bullshit!

01:35:47.088 --> 01:35:50.524
I don't know why I'm talking to you.
What has this got to do with you?

01:35:50.591 --> 01:35:53.754
This is between me and him.
What are you doing in this office?

01:35:53.828 --> 01:35:55.853
What are you doing here? Get outta here!

01:35:55.930 --> 01:35:58.728
Don't talk to her like that, Walter.

01:35:59.967 --> 01:36:03.027
- It's between me and you.
- It is between you and me.

01:36:03.104 --> 01:36:07.803
Are you telling me how to talk to my wife?
You shut your fucking toilet.

01:36:07.875 --> 01:36:11.811
Leave. Leave, please, Brandon. Go. Go.

01:36:11.879 --> 01:36:14.143
Please. Go. Leave.

01:36:15.750 --> 01:36:17.547
Listen to me, you son of a bitch.

01:36:17.618 --> 01:36:21.145
Don't you ever talk to me like that, ever.

01:36:22.557 --> 01:36:24.320
I'm sorry.

01:36:28.362 --> 01:36:29.920
(knock at door)

01:36:29.997 --> 01:36:32.022
Hey, Brandon! Hoo!

01:36:32.100 --> 01:36:34.830
It's Walter. Don't get excited.

01:36:34.902 --> 01:36:37.393
All is forgiven.

01:36:37.472 --> 01:36:39.303
Hey.

01:36:41.008 --> 01:36:44.068
- What time is it?
- It's 6am.

01:36:44.145 --> 01:36:48.241
I gotta fly to Vegas, meet with
some clients - hand-holding thing -

01:36:48.316 --> 01:36:52.753
and just keep them aboard for the last game,
because you can do this thing.

01:36:52.820 --> 01:36:56.381
End of the season's the perfect place
to turn a streak around.

01:36:56.457 --> 01:36:59.824
I'll be back tonight.
We'll go out. We'll have a good meal.

01:36:59.894 --> 01:37:04.831
You know, get you
back in the groove again. 9:30, Nobu.

01:37:04.899 --> 01:37:08.528
We're turning it around.
I'll see you tonight.

01:37:15.076 --> 01:37:17.636
Hey, Brandon.

01:37:17.712 --> 01:37:19.373
Hey, Toni.

01:37:19.447 --> 01:37:23.281
- I didn't know you were coming.
- Walter was delayed.

01:37:23.351 --> 01:37:27.720
He'll be back in the morning.
Asked if I'd fill in.

01:37:28.789 --> 01:37:30.780
You know what's funny?

01:37:30.858 --> 01:37:33.258
He didn't call me.

01:37:36.397 --> 01:37:39.059
- You OK?
- Yeah.

01:37:39.133 --> 01:37:41.397
Julia did her...

01:37:49.777 --> 01:37:51.938
I'm sorry.

01:37:56.083 --> 01:37:58.244
He's gambling.

01:38:00.054 --> 01:38:02.113
- Yep.
- Yeah.

01:38:03.090 --> 01:38:06.253
I just can't believe I'm here again.

01:38:06.327 --> 01:38:08.557
I just...

01:38:08.629 --> 01:38:11.826
I just can't believe it, you know.
I saw it coming.

01:38:11.899 --> 01:38:14.424
I just couldn't stop it.

01:38:20.107 --> 01:38:22.667
I gotta win one more game.

01:38:23.644 --> 01:38:26.010
You can't fix this, Brandon.

01:38:27.081 --> 01:38:29.345
You can't fix it.

01:38:57.345 --> 01:39:00.041
- Come here for a second.
- What?

01:39:00.815 --> 01:39:05.081
I'm gonna kiss you right now, OK?
Trust me on this.

01:39:33.814 --> 01:39:36.408
(Julia) OK, Daddy, open the present.

01:39:40.488 --> 01:39:42.285
Oh!

01:39:42.356 --> 01:39:46.622
Oh, look at this. It's so beautiful.

01:39:46.694 --> 01:39:49.686
Daddy, not the paper! In there.

01:39:50.164 --> 01:39:52.632
Oh!

01:39:52.700 --> 01:39:55.328
Oh, man.

01:39:55.403 --> 01:39:56.995
Beautiful.

01:39:57.071 --> 01:39:59.369
Baby, this is beautiful.

01:39:59.807 --> 01:40:01.707
- Happy anniversary.
- (knock at door)

01:40:02.143 --> 01:40:04.611
- I'll get it.
- OK.

01:40:04.679 --> 01:40:08.012
Oh, thank you, honey.
What am I gonna do with this?

01:40:09.183 --> 01:40:11.674
- It's a dangerous thing to give me.
- Brandon!

01:40:11.752 --> 01:40:13.913
- (Brandon) Hello.
- Look who's here.

01:40:13.988 --> 01:40:17.287
- Oh, you're back from Vegas.
- (Walter) Join the celebration.

01:40:17.358 --> 01:40:19.622
- What's going on?
- Well...

01:40:19.694 --> 01:40:23.186
Toni and I were married
12 years ago today.

01:40:23.264 --> 01:40:25.562
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

01:40:25.633 --> 01:40:28.727
Angel, give Mommy her gift.

01:40:29.637 --> 01:40:33.164
(Walter hums "Funeral March" by Chopin)

01:40:36.510 --> 01:40:39.070
It's OK, baby. I saved for it.

01:40:39.146 --> 01:40:41.774
We got enough, believe me.

01:40:43.551 --> 01:40:46.076
We're not broke yet, honey. Put 'em on.

01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:50.320
Come on. I wanna see them on you.
Let me see them.

01:40:50.758 --> 01:40:52.851
Ooh!

01:40:52.927 --> 01:40:56.385
I got beautiful taste, don't I?
Brandon, I couldn't leave you out.

01:40:56.464 --> 01:41:00.195
It's sort of our anniversary,
anyway, isn't it?

01:41:01.502 --> 01:41:03.595
They're made for car racing.

01:41:03.671 --> 01:41:08.438
The guy who wore this
won six straight times at Le Mans.

01:41:08.509 --> 01:41:11.000
Put it on.
Maybe you'll start winning again.

01:41:11.078 --> 01:41:13.273
Walter, I can't take this, man.

01:41:14.849 --> 01:41:17.443
- Why not?
- It's too much.

01:41:17.518 --> 01:41:20.976
We all love each other here, right?
You're family.

01:41:21.055 --> 01:41:24.183
I'm like your father, you're like my son.

01:41:24.825 --> 01:41:28.283
That would make you his mother,
wouldn't it, Toni?

01:41:30.030 --> 01:41:33.056
Oh, I said something wrong, didn't I?

01:41:33.134 --> 01:41:36.103
What are you doing? Keep 'em on.

01:41:37.004 --> 01:41:41.532
- They're for evening, Walter.
- So what? Wear 'em to bed. Come on.

01:41:41.609 --> 01:41:43.975
Brandon, I got you.

01:41:44.044 --> 01:41:45.841
Who do you like in the big game?

01:41:45.913 --> 01:41:49.314
- Turn that off, Walter.
- Why? What, are you camera shy?

01:41:49.383 --> 01:41:52.409
- Turn that off.
- Hey, man, surprise me.

01:41:52.486 --> 01:41:54.647
We'll break it
when we do the live TV show.

01:42:12.173 --> 01:42:17.042
(man) Coming up on "Sports Advisors,"
John Anthony's Super Forty selections.

01:42:17.111 --> 01:42:20.274
It's live, and it's next.

01:42:20.881 --> 01:42:24.373
I know he's supposed to be here.
I know where he is. He's in the bathroom.

01:42:24.452 --> 01:42:26.443
(breathes heavily)

01:42:29.957 --> 01:42:31.720
Fuck!

01:42:31.792 --> 01:42:35.922
- (knock at door)
- (man) Two minutes till we go live.

01:42:36.931 --> 01:42:38.023
(vomits)

01:42:38.466 --> 01:42:40.559
What the hell is he doing?

01:42:55.082 --> 01:42:57.312
Heads, New York, tails, Kansas City.

01:42:59.753 --> 01:43:01.914
Heads, over, tails, under.

01:43:03.424 --> 01:43:05.289
John Anthony!

01:43:12.566 --> 01:43:15.501
- Here he is.
- (director) 40 seconds till we're live.

01:43:15.569 --> 01:43:18.265
40 seconds.
Come on, come on, come on.

01:43:23.210 --> 01:43:26.737
- (director) We're at 30.
- Uh, New York, minus one and a half

01:43:26.814 --> 01:43:28.975
and the over, 36.

01:43:29.750 --> 01:43:32.014
Wanna know about those picks?

01:43:32.086 --> 01:43:34.782
- (director) 20 seconds to air.
- Hold on.

01:43:34.855 --> 01:43:37.255
What should I know about 'em?

01:43:37.324 --> 01:43:39.815
I flipped a coin to decide.

01:43:42.396 --> 01:43:45.763
- (director) Ten.
- Push it all the way, Southie.

01:43:47.735 --> 01:43:50.169
And five, four,

01:43:50.237 --> 01:43:52.637
three, two...

01:43:52.706 --> 01:43:57.006
(man) Live from the WDIX studios
high above Manhattan,

01:43:57.077 --> 01:43:59.307
here's your host, Walter Abrams.

01:43:59.380 --> 01:44:02.713
Hello, everybody,
and welcome to the big weekend.

01:44:03.183 --> 01:44:07.847
Never before in the history of this industry
has an offer been made

01:44:07.922 --> 01:44:10.482
like the one I'm about to present
to you now.

01:44:10.558 --> 01:44:15.325
I am so confident
in John Anthony's picks for this Sunday,

01:44:15.396 --> 01:44:20.095
I'm so sure of the skills
he's brought to bear,

01:44:20.167 --> 01:44:23.000
and so anxious for you
to get on the phone

01:44:23.070 --> 01:44:25.698
and dial the toll-free number
on your screen

01:44:25.773 --> 01:44:29.766
that for the first time
in sports-service history,

01:44:29.843 --> 01:44:33.643
I am going to guarantee our picks
this weekend.

01:44:34.415 --> 01:44:38.875
- What's that mean?
- What does that mean? It means this.

01:44:38.953 --> 01:44:43.185
You tell us how much you're betting
with your bookie,

01:44:43.257 --> 01:44:46.226
you lose, we cover.

01:44:47.294 --> 01:44:50.457
You heard me right. That's risk-free.

01:44:50.531 --> 01:44:53.159
Now let's go to the oracle,

01:44:53.233 --> 01:44:55.360
God's gift, John Anthony.

01:44:55.436 --> 01:44:58.963
Wow. That's all I can say.

01:44:59.039 --> 01:45:03.476
The phones are gonna be flooded, Walter,
and they should be.

01:45:03.544 --> 01:45:08.140
Hey, John, why don't you run down
the pitfalls facing the average bettor?

01:45:08.215 --> 01:45:13.482
I mean, when you think about it, a game
this huge, all the added dynamics...

01:45:13.554 --> 01:45:16.250
I mean, uh, without your expertise,

01:45:16.323 --> 01:45:21.158
I guess the average bettor might as well
just, what, flip a coin.

01:45:21.228 --> 01:45:25.358
Walter? No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:45:25.432 --> 01:45:30.631
Hang on. You can't guarantee that they're gonna win.
That's insane. Come on.

01:45:30.704 --> 01:45:35.573
I say if you can flip a coin to make a pick,
I can guarantee the game.

01:45:35.643 --> 01:45:39.340
- What if we lose?
- Ah, fuck it. I'm ruined anyway.

01:45:39.413 --> 01:45:43.873
Look, man. Cover your ass, all right.
At least cap the thing out, right?

01:45:43.951 --> 01:45:47.387
- Oh, Brandon, can't you feel it?
- What?

01:45:47.454 --> 01:45:51.220
- Can't you just feel it?
- I have no idea what you're talking about.

01:45:51.291 --> 01:45:54.590
Oh, I think you do. I think you do.

01:45:54.662 --> 01:45:58.154
You know, the best part of the best drug
in the world ain't the high.

01:45:58.232 --> 01:46:01.292
It's the moment just before you take it.

01:46:01.368 --> 01:46:03.598
The dice are dancing on the table.

01:46:04.605 --> 01:46:07.301
Between now and the time they stop,

01:46:08.308 --> 01:46:10.776
that's the greatest high in the world.

01:46:11.612 --> 01:46:15.742
(Southie) Made up your mind yet?
It's the last minute! I'm here to make you money!

01:46:15.816 --> 01:46:19.217
New York's the one-and-a-half point
favorite, the over and under is 36.

01:46:19.286 --> 01:46:21.447
I want you to bet New York in the over.

01:46:21.522 --> 01:46:24.582
- Come on, guy, it's a fucking lock.
- It's New York in the over.

01:46:24.658 --> 01:46:28.526
You can parlay it, tease it,
do whatever you want, 'cause it's guaranteed.

01:46:28.595 --> 01:46:30.927
- Our reputation is the guarantee.
- (man) Tammy!

01:46:30.998 --> 01:46:32.158
(Tammy) I'm coming.

01:46:32.232 --> 01:46:35.201
28 years in the business,
we're not going anywhere.

01:46:35.269 --> 01:46:40.070
- Can we please get some air in here?
- (man) You gotta make up your mind.

01:46:40.140 --> 01:46:43.075
OK, that's it. Kill the phones. Come on.

01:46:43.143 --> 01:46:45.543
Right now. Let's go, let's go.

01:46:45.612 --> 01:46:48.445
(TV) They come from New York
and Kansas City in this match-up.

01:46:48.515 --> 01:46:51.040
The opening kickoff is coming up next.

01:46:58.192 --> 01:47:02.652
We are under way in Super Forty. It's
a high end-over-ender. Down the middle.

01:47:02.730 --> 01:47:06.689
Jackson gets it, a short one for the 15,
tries to angle over to the right side,

01:47:06.767 --> 01:47:09.235
stripped away from...

01:47:09.937 --> 01:47:12.269
- Kansas City comes up with it.
- Ah, man.

01:47:12.339 --> 01:47:17.299
Harris getting to the outside, turns,
clear path. Boy, does he have blocking.

01:47:17.377 --> 01:47:19.709
- Touchdown, Kansas City.
- Shit.

01:47:19.780 --> 01:47:23.113
- Sets out for the pocket. Simpson.
- He's open.

01:47:23.183 --> 01:47:27.142
Guns one over the middle, Simpson
on the completion. It's second and 15.

01:47:27.221 --> 01:47:29.451
- Setting up, he's got time again.
- Go, go.

01:47:29.523 --> 01:47:32.048
Looks down field
and the slam intercepted.

01:47:32.126 --> 01:47:34.924
- What the fuck is that?
- Dawkins finds a wave of blockers.

01:47:34.995 --> 01:47:40.365
Over to the near side, he's going to go
the distance. Touchdown, Kansas City.

01:47:40.434 --> 01:47:43.403
14-nothing, Kansas City over New York.

01:47:45.038 --> 01:47:48.201
New York's got it now
for the third time in the game.

01:47:48.275 --> 01:47:51.472
Back to throw once again,
pocket collapses and down it goes.

01:47:51.545 --> 01:47:55.413
Oh, man. You better hold on
to that coin you flipped,

01:47:55.482 --> 01:47:59.578
because this game keeps up like this,
I'm gonna have to borrow it.

01:47:59.653 --> 01:48:02.588
Well, it's not over yet, Walter.

01:48:02.656 --> 01:48:04.715
I wouldn't change my bet. Hm?

01:48:08.562 --> 01:48:10.996
And second and long,
second and about a dozen.

01:48:11.064 --> 01:48:13.658
Can they get something started?

01:48:16.403 --> 01:48:19.634
What are they counting on today?
Do they have to get away

01:48:19.706 --> 01:48:22.197
from the balanced attack
we've seen all season?

01:48:22.276 --> 01:48:26.975
Will they lose the ground game now?
Will they go over to the pass?

01:48:27.047 --> 01:48:32.246
Well, there is no way they'll be able
to run when they're 14 points down.

01:48:44.898 --> 01:48:49.358
Handoff goes to the second man through.
It's Jones, fullback, off the right side.

01:48:49.436 --> 01:48:52.371
He's got room, downfield he goes.
Will anybody catch him?

01:48:52.439 --> 01:48:55.670
Deep into the secondary now.
Touchdown, New York.

01:48:56.743 --> 01:49:00.611
Extra point makes it 14-7, Kansas City.

01:49:01.882 --> 01:49:07.286
(radio) Kansas scores on the eight-play
drive, capped with Rogers's 32-yard run.

01:49:07.354 --> 01:49:13.452
And that's the end of the third quarter.
It's Kansas City, 21, New York, ten.

01:49:13.527 --> 01:49:16.758
(TV) Back to throw once again.
Post available...

01:49:16.830 --> 01:49:19.765
- Let's go!
...beats the safety down the right side.

01:49:19.833 --> 01:49:21.824
He's in!

01:49:21.902 --> 01:49:23.767
All right!

01:49:23.837 --> 01:49:29.469
It's Kansas City, 21, New York, 17. What
a final four minutes we're going to have.

01:49:29.543 --> 01:49:31.204
- Where's Brandon?
- I don't know.

01:49:31.278 --> 01:49:33.269
Where's Brandon?

01:49:34.481 --> 01:49:36.972
We're back in it, babe!

01:49:37.050 --> 01:49:40.213
New York touchdown
and we win both bets!

01:49:41.288 --> 01:49:43.051
Hey!

01:49:43.123 --> 01:49:46.251
- Hey, Brandon?
- I believe this'll be their final possession.

01:49:46.326 --> 01:49:50.194
Can they do it? Can they get it done
like they have all year long?

01:49:50.264 --> 01:49:55.133
They're trailing by four. Don't forget,
the new rule doesn't apply here.

01:49:55.202 --> 01:49:57.762
They've gotta get into the end zone.

01:49:58.705 --> 01:50:01.606
- He left.
- I know.

01:50:01.675 --> 01:50:03.870
You didn't tell me?

01:50:08.015 --> 01:50:09.880
How about that?

01:50:09.950 --> 01:50:13.147
No goodbye, no... no nothing.

01:50:13.220 --> 01:50:17.452
- I'm sure it's all there in the letter.
- I'm sure it is.

01:50:17.591 --> 01:50:20.788
I wonder what's not in here.

01:50:20.861 --> 01:50:23.352
What do you mean?

01:50:23.931 --> 01:50:29.233
- What do you mean, what do I mean?
- He had enough. He wanted his life back.

01:50:29.303 --> 01:50:31.294
He said that to you?

01:50:31.371 --> 01:50:34.272
Well, loud and clear, by leaving.

01:50:35.876 --> 01:50:39.676
- I think it was something else.
- Yeah? Tell me.

01:50:40.447 --> 01:50:42.574
You know.

01:50:43.183 --> 01:50:44.650
No.

01:50:44.718 --> 01:50:47.380
You have no idea?

01:50:49.423 --> 01:50:53.416
- You're missing the game, Walter.
- Oh, no. This is the game.

01:50:53.493 --> 01:50:55.688
(TV) On first down,
the handoff is to Jones.

01:50:55.762 --> 01:50:58.822
He's on the right side.
He's got a blocker. And a first down.

01:50:58.899 --> 01:51:01.197
- But he's dropped inbounds.
- Nice.

01:51:01.268 --> 01:51:04.169
I guess Brandon was homesick.
I don't know.

01:51:04.237 --> 01:51:07.070
Or maybe he had
such deep feelings for me

01:51:07.140 --> 01:51:11.304
that he couldn't face saying goodbye.

01:51:15.882 --> 01:51:17.873
Wait a minute.

01:51:19.786 --> 01:51:22.721
I just got an idea. Just came to me.

01:51:22.789 --> 01:51:25.383
I mean, out of the blue.

01:51:25.459 --> 01:51:27.450
What about this?

01:51:28.328 --> 01:51:33.163
Brandon didn't tell me
he was gonna leave because...

01:51:34.167 --> 01:51:36.829
you let him fuck you.

01:51:38.872 --> 01:51:42.808
Back to pass, rolls under the left side.
Guns it over the middle, it's complete.

01:51:42.876 --> 01:51:45.640
Edwards has it, all the way
down to the 44, Kansas City.

01:51:45.712 --> 01:51:47.839
Oh, God.

01:51:48.448 --> 01:51:51.008
- You deny it?
- (whispers) Oh, my God.

01:51:52.386 --> 01:51:54.445
Do I have to, Walter?

01:51:54.521 --> 01:51:56.682
You know you did.

01:51:56.757 --> 01:51:59.123
Oh, you...
Another lock of the year?

01:51:59.192 --> 01:52:01.160
I saw you, Toni.

01:52:01.228 --> 01:52:04.129
I saw you and him, that night.

01:52:04.197 --> 01:52:06.597
I never went to Vegas.

01:52:06.666 --> 01:52:09.134
You mean you lied to me about the trip.

01:52:09.202 --> 01:52:11.397
Oh, don't talk to me about lying.

01:52:11.471 --> 01:52:15.567
- I guess you had the whole thing set up.
- Oh, don't make this about me.

01:52:15.642 --> 01:52:19.942
- Just put me out there on a tray?
- I put a tray out there.

01:52:20.013 --> 01:52:25.076
You didn't have to shove a fucking apple
in your mouth and sit on it!

01:52:25.152 --> 01:52:28.986
He's looking for his hot receiver.
Edwards, again, got it! Kansas City, 23.

01:52:29.056 --> 01:52:30.785
Admit it!

01:52:31.625 --> 01:52:33.456
You played me, Walter.

01:52:33.527 --> 01:52:36.621
You're fucking-A I did.

01:52:37.431 --> 01:52:40.628
It worked. Didn't it?

01:52:40.700 --> 01:52:44.295
(TV) With eight seconds left, New York
has to spend their final time-out.

01:52:44.371 --> 01:52:46.601
Brandon was right.

01:52:46.673 --> 01:52:50.336
- But you don't deny it?
- It's the best pick he ever made.

01:52:51.244 --> 01:52:53.542
I don't know what that means.

01:52:53.613 --> 01:52:58.448
Deep drop sets up in the pocket. Fires
over the middle. Batted down at the line!

01:52:58.518 --> 01:53:02.716
So after everything,
it all comes down to one final play.

01:53:04.891 --> 01:53:08.884
You were gambling with me that night, Walter.
With me!

01:53:10.197 --> 01:53:12.495
Brandon knew it,
because he knew you.

01:53:12.566 --> 01:53:15.057
He told me he was sure
you were watching somehow.

01:53:15.135 --> 01:53:19.196
So he asked me in to spend the night
and put on a little show for you, Walter.

01:53:19.272 --> 01:53:23.265
But I didn't believe him, Walter.
Oh, God, I didn't believe him.

01:53:23.343 --> 01:53:27.143
I mean, after all we've been through.
So I figured, you know, "What the hell?"

01:53:27.214 --> 01:53:29.774
He slipped out the back, no big deal.

01:53:29.850 --> 01:53:32.250
He never even stayed here.

01:53:32.752 --> 01:53:34.310
And you.

01:53:34.387 --> 01:53:37.220
You were in such a good mood
the next day.

01:53:37.290 --> 01:53:39.884
I figured, "Thank God,
because he must've been wrong."

01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:43.361
"Otherwise, why wouldn't he confront us,
confront me?"

01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:44.897
Oh, Walter.

01:53:44.965 --> 01:53:49.868
So it all boils down to this.
Can New York find the end zone?

01:53:49.936 --> 01:53:52.530
This is what players dream of.

01:53:52.606 --> 01:53:56.167
The chance to win it on the final snap.

01:53:56.243 --> 01:54:00.737
You wanted to lose! Like I was something
you could just toss on the table!

01:54:00.814 --> 01:54:03.374
Only we booked your bet, Walter,
Brandon and me,

01:54:03.450 --> 01:54:07.284
who evidently love you
more than you love yourself.

01:54:08.655 --> 01:54:11.283
Spreads the defense.
Drops back to throw.

01:54:11.358 --> 01:54:14.020
Here comes the pressure.
He bounces to the right side.

01:54:14.094 --> 01:54:17.427
Your fantasy is to end up alone
with nothing!

01:54:19.432 --> 01:54:21.423
I won't let that happen.
Understand?

01:54:21.501 --> 01:54:24.299
I will never let that happen to you.
This is it.

01:54:24.371 --> 01:54:27.534
He's on the run,
picks up a big block downfield.

01:54:27.607 --> 01:54:32.601
This is real, Walter.
You and me and Julia, we're all that's real.

01:54:34.548 --> 01:54:35.913
One man to beat.

01:54:36.616 --> 01:54:39.050
This is it, Walter.

01:54:39.119 --> 01:54:41.212
He goes airborne from the five.

01:54:41.288 --> 01:54:43.586
- Does he get in?
- He's in! He's in!

01:54:45.125 --> 01:54:47.958
Touchdown, New York!

01:54:55.168 --> 01:54:57.659
(conversation muted by music)

01:55:54.060 --> 01:55:57.496
(cheerleaders chant)
Apaches, win this game, a-whoosh!

01:55:58.298 --> 01:56:01.426
Giants, with me! Over here with me!
This side, this side,

01:56:01.501 --> 01:56:03.969
this side, right in front of me, right here.

01:56:04.037 --> 01:56:06.232
Take a knee, take a knee, take a knee.

01:56:06.306 --> 01:56:10.470
We got a tough team we're playing today,
y'all know that. Toughest on our schedule.

01:56:10.543 --> 01:56:15.344
Now, most important thing
we're gonna do today is have fun.

01:56:15.415 --> 01:56:20.045
I mean, have some serious fun.
We're gonna play loose and enjoy ourselves.

01:56:20.120 --> 01:56:22.588
We're gonna play
this wonderful game of football.

01:56:22.656 --> 01:56:24.715
- Do we wanna win?
- Yeah!

01:56:24.791 --> 01:56:27.351
- What are we gonna do, play?
- Play!

01:56:27.427 --> 01:56:28.826
- Huh?
- Play!

01:56:28.895 --> 01:56:32.558
- Ah, let's go do it!
- (cheering and whooping)

01:56:38.872 --> 01:56:40.897
What's going on, chief?

01:56:40.974 --> 01:56:44.034
Coach, do you really think
we can win today?

01:56:44.110 --> 01:56:46.169
Ho!

01:56:46.246 --> 01:56:47.577
I'd bet on it.

01:56:47.647 --> 01:56:49.945
