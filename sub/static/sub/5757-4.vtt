WEBVTT

00:04.805 --> 00:06.307
WAIT, THAT'S NOT IAN.

00:06.340 --> 00:07.341
WREN?

00:09.410 --> 00:10.778
WHAT IS HE GIVING HER?

00:12.280 --> 00:14.082
"...IF YOU CONTINUE
AS A ROSEWOOD'S MVP,

00:14.115 --> 00:15.483
WE CAN OFFER YOU
A FULL SCHOLARSHIP."

00:15.516 --> 00:16.817
THIS MEANS
YOU DON'T HAVE TO MOVE!

00:16.850 --> 00:18.686
EM, DID YOU
WRITE THIS LETTER?

00:20.121 --> 00:21.355
I FOUND THIS
ON THE DOORMAT.

00:21.389 --> 00:22.723
THEY WANT YOU
ON THEIR TEAM.

00:22.756 --> 00:25.159
HONEY, IT'S FANTASTIC!
CONGRATULATIONS!

00:25.193 --> 00:27.161
WHO'S THAT?
DANIELLE.

00:27.195 --> 00:28.429
WELL, DOES SHE KNOW
YOU'RE CRUSHING ON HER?

00:28.462 --> 00:31.365
WHO'S LUCAS?
OH, MY FRIEND OVER THERE.

00:31.399 --> 00:33.167
I'M STARTING A NEW JOB.
WHO'S IT FOR?

00:33.201 --> 00:35.836
JASON DiLAURENTIS.
YOU CAN'T WORK FOR HIM.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.106
I NEED CASH TO BUY
TOOLS AND A TRUCK.

00:38.139 --> 00:39.840
I DIDN'T LEAVE
WITHOUT SAYING GOODBYE,

00:39.873 --> 00:42.243
SO I WROTE YOU A LETTER.

00:42.276 --> 00:44.578
I'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO FORGET THAT YOU
WERE USING ME.

00:44.612 --> 00:46.247
I'M SORRY.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.749
WE JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH YOUR THERAPIST.

00:48.782 --> 00:52.353
SHE'S RECOMMENDING THAT
YOU SPEND SOME TIME APART.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.255
YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT
I CAN'T SEE MY FRIENDS?

00:54.288 --> 00:55.789
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:55.823 --> 00:57.658
I'M LOOKING FOR MY RING.
WOULD YOU MIND GETTING UP?

00:57.691 --> 00:59.393
I'LL BE BACK FOR IT ON MONDAY.

00:59.427 --> 01:03.197
AS SOON AS THE BANKS OPEN,
I'LL HAVE THE CASH.

01:03.231 --> 01:05.199
SPENCER!

01:05.233 --> 01:07.868
TAKE IT. IT'S YOURS.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.170
ARE YOU CRAZY?

01:15.609 --> 01:16.710
I'M BACK.

01:16.744 --> 01:19.447
HUH. I'M SURPRISED.

01:19.480 --> 01:22.416
UM, HERE'S MY RECEIPT
FOR THE RING.

01:28.322 --> 01:30.158
OH! SORRY.

01:44.872 --> 01:46.807
( indistinct shouting )

01:49.510 --> 01:51.245
( indistinct shouting )

01:55.316 --> 01:57.451
THIS PLACE IS SKEEVY.

01:57.485 --> 01:58.786
SHE PAWNED HER SISTER'S
WEDDING RING.

01:58.819 --> 02:00.288
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GO
TO TIFFANY'S.

02:00.321 --> 02:02.156
SO...
WREN AND MELISSA?

02:02.190 --> 02:03.457
WEIRD, RIGHT?

02:03.491 --> 02:04.825
COULD YOU TELL
WHAT HE GAVE HER?

02:04.858 --> 02:07.728
NO. SHE DIDN'T SEEM
HAPPY ABOUT IT.

02:07.761 --> 02:09.330
I WONDER IF IAN WILL BE.

02:10.398 --> 02:12.266
HOW YOU HOLDIN' UP?

02:12.300 --> 02:15.269
GREAT. EVER SINCE
I GOT THAT FAKE
SCHOLARSHIP LETTER,

02:15.303 --> 02:17.905
MY MOM THINKS
I CAN DO NO WRONG.

02:17.938 --> 02:19.607
I'M LIVING A LIE
I DIDN'T EVEN TELL.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.442
LEAVE IT TO "A"
TO MAKE YOU FEEL BAD

02:21.475 --> 02:22.910
ABOUT YOUR
MOM FEELING GOOD.

02:26.714 --> 02:29.583
HERE YOU GO.

02:29.617 --> 02:30.851
HORSESHOE?

02:30.884 --> 02:32.420
UH-HUH.

02:32.453 --> 02:35.223
IS THIS SOME KIND OF A JOKE?
I-I BROUGHT IN A RING.

02:35.256 --> 02:37.358
NOT ACCORDING
TO THE TICKET.

02:37.391 --> 02:39.893
YOU GAVE ME THAT TICKET
48 HOURS AGO.

02:39.927 --> 02:41.729
LOT OF PEOPLE COME
THROUGH HERE IN THAT TIME.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.397
I NEED
THAT RING BACK TODAY,

02:43.431 --> 02:44.732
SO I NEED YOU
TO GET BACK DOWN THERE

02:44.765 --> 02:46.300
BEHIND THAT COUNTER
AND FIND IT.

02:46.334 --> 02:47.768
OR WHAT?

02:47.801 --> 02:49.470
YOU... WANT TO CALL
THE POLICE,

02:49.503 --> 02:51.805
TALK TO THEM ABOUT IT?

02:51.839 --> 02:53.574
BE MY GUEST.

02:58.779 --> 03:00.681
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT IT'S GONE.

03:00.714 --> 03:03.451
AT LEAST YOU GOT
YOUR MONEY BACK?

03:03.484 --> 03:05.219
AM I SUPPOSED
TO GIVE HER THIS?

03:05.253 --> 03:09.523
I STOLE IT--
I ACTUALLY STOLE
MY SISTER'S WEDDING RING!

03:09.557 --> 03:12.626
( cell phones ringing )

03:18.732 --> 03:24.905
"JUST MY LUCK--
DIAMONDS ARE A GIRL'S
BEST FRIEND. 'A.'"

03:47.861 --> 03:49.997
* GOT A SECRET,
 CAN YOU KEEP IT *

03:50.030 --> 03:52.633
* SWEAR THIS ONE
 YOU'LL SAVE *

03:52.666 --> 03:55.269
* BETTER LOCK IT
 IN YOUR POCKET *

03:55.303 --> 03:57.605
* TAKIN' THIS ONE
 TO THE GRAVE *

03:57.638 --> 03:59.807
* IF I SHOW YOU
 THEN I KNOW YOU *

03:59.840 --> 04:02.676
* WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID

04:02.710 --> 04:07.515
* 'CAUSE TWO CAN KEEP A SECRET
 IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD *

04:17.725 --> 04:19.993
COFFEE IS MADE,
NEWSPAPER IS IN,

04:20.027 --> 04:22.996
AND YOUR FATHER IS PUTTING
BREAKFAST ON THE TABLE.

04:23.030 --> 04:24.665
DOUBLE-BERRY PANCAKES.

04:24.698 --> 04:28.936
WOW! WE-- WE HAVEN'T
HAD THOSE SINCE...

04:28.969 --> 04:30.938
I KNOW. I MISS THEM.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.940
IT SORT OF FEELS LIKE
EVERYTHING'S FINALLY

04:32.973 --> 04:34.875
GETTING BACK
TO NORMAL AROUND HERE.

04:34.908 --> 04:36.377
I LIKE THAT.

04:36.410 --> 04:37.611
SO DO I.

04:39.012 --> 04:41.382
MIKE, BREAKFAST.

04:41.415 --> 04:42.850
Mike: I'LL GRAB
SOMETHING LATER.

04:42.883 --> 04:44.585
MIKE, ON THE OTHER HAND,

04:44.618 --> 04:47.655
MAY NOT BE ON THE SAME
PAGE ABOUT ME BEING BACK.

04:47.688 --> 04:48.922
NO, HE'S FINE.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.524
WHY SHOULDN'T HE BE?

04:50.558 --> 04:52.560
AT LEAST HE HAS A SOCIAL LIFE.

04:52.593 --> 04:54.595
I KNOW THIS NOT BEING
ABLE TO SEE YOUR FRIENDS

04:54.628 --> 04:55.996
IS PROBABLY REALLY TOUGH.

04:56.029 --> 04:57.898
YEAH, THAT'S
AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

04:57.931 --> 05:00.000
YOU DO KNOW THAT
WE'RE ONLY DOING THIS

05:00.033 --> 05:02.436
BECAUSE WE FEEL
IT'S BEST FOR YOU,

05:02.470 --> 05:04.438
FOR ALL OF YOU.

05:04.472 --> 05:06.106
( coughs ) NOW...

05:06.139 --> 05:07.475
WHAT?

05:07.508 --> 05:08.942
HOW DO I LOOK?

05:08.976 --> 05:11.745
NICE.

05:11.779 --> 05:13.447
NICER THAN USUAL. WHY?

05:13.481 --> 05:17.451
BECAUSE TODAY
IS MY FIRST DAY...

05:17.485 --> 05:19.820
OF BEING A FULL-TIME
TEACHER! RIGHT!

05:19.853 --> 05:22.456
SORRY. I'VE JUST BEEN
KIND OF...

05:22.490 --> 05:24.858
SO, DO THEY--

05:24.892 --> 05:26.394
DO THEY KNOW WHAT CLASS
YOU'RE GONNA TEACH?

05:26.427 --> 05:28.662
I'M TAKING OVER
MR. FITZ'S CLASS.

05:30.498 --> 05:32.766
TRY AND CONTAIN
YOUR ENTHUSIASM.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.902
NO. I-IT'S NOT THAT.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.473
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.576
IT'LL BE GREAT.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.627
GOING SOMEWHERE?

06:01.495 --> 06:02.663
NO.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.632
WHY DO YOU HAVE
YOUR PASSPORT?

06:04.665 --> 06:08.902
IT'S-- IT'S NOT MINE.
IT'S IAN'S.

06:08.936 --> 06:12.573
I NEED IT FOR
THE INSURANCE CLAIM
ON MY RING.

06:12.606 --> 06:15.409
IT STILL HASN'T TURNED UP?

06:17.511 --> 06:18.946
IT WILL.

06:20.481 --> 06:22.683
I'D RATHER FIND MY HUSBAND.

06:36.029 --> 06:37.831
( sighs )
I'LL BE HOME AFTER SCHOOL,

06:37.865 --> 06:40.634
SEEING AS I CAN'T HANG OUT
WITH ANY OF MY FRIENDS.

06:40.668 --> 06:41.902
ABOUT THAT--

06:41.935 --> 06:43.804
I WAS TALKING WITH
SPENCER'S MOM YESTERDAY.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.939
AND YOU REALIZED THAT
THIS WHOLE BESTIE-BAN

06:45.973 --> 06:47.941
WAS A TERRIBLE IDEA,
AND I CAN HANG OUT WITH THEM?

06:47.975 --> 06:50.644
NO, WE REALIZED THAT
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE

06:50.678 --> 06:53.146
WHO HASN'T BEEN TO
A SOLO SESSION WITH
YOUR THERAPIST YET.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.682
SO?

06:54.715 --> 06:57.017
SO, YOUR FATHER AND I
THINK YOU SHOULD.

06:57.050 --> 06:59.853
YOUR FRIENDS HAVE ALL
TAKEN IT SERIOUSLY.

06:59.887 --> 07:01.689
I THINK IT WOULD BE
A GOOD IDEA IF YOU DID TOO.

07:01.722 --> 07:04.191
CAN'T WE JUST WATCH
 INTERVENTION AND SAY
THAT I WENT?

07:04.224 --> 07:08.028
STOP. YOU'RE GOING.
AFTER SCHOOL TODAY.

07:08.061 --> 07:10.030
WOW.

07:10.063 --> 07:12.633
MY WEEK'S REALLY
SHAPING UP.

07:33.921 --> 07:35.088
HEY!

07:35.122 --> 07:37.825
I HAVE A SURPRISE
FOR YOU.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.094
WHAT'S THAT?

07:41.128 --> 07:43.163
WELL... TAKE A LOOK.

07:48.536 --> 07:50.771
( chuckles softly )
WHO SENT THESE?

07:50.804 --> 07:55.042
WELL, I WOULD IMAGINE
IT'S THE SCOUT YOU SPOKE TO
OVER AT DANBY. WHO ELSE?

08:05.085 --> 08:07.821
YEAH. YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:07.855 --> 08:10.524
SOMEBODY MUST REALLY
WANT YOU OVER AT THAT
SCHOOL, HUH?

08:16.730 --> 08:18.098
Female Vocalist:
 * TWO AT A TIME,
 THEY SAY *

08:18.131 --> 08:19.967
HEY!

08:20.000 --> 08:21.869
CAN I HAVE
SOME OF THOSE?

08:21.902 --> 08:23.737
HAVE THEM ALL.
I MAY NEVER EAT AGAIN.

08:23.771 --> 08:26.607
UGH. THE RAT FALL
IN THE FRY OIL AGAIN?
'CAUSE LAST TIME...

08:26.640 --> 08:29.810
IT'S NOT THE FOOD.
IT'S... DANIELLE.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.679
YEARBOOK DANIELLE?
WHAT'S WRONG?

08:31.712 --> 08:34.214
WHAT'S RIGHT? EVER SINCE
YOU HELPED ME SCORE
A DATE WITH HER,

08:34.246 --> 08:38.284
MY STOMACH HAS BEEN LIKE
A RAT FELL IN MY FRY OIL.

08:38.318 --> 08:40.788
I'M COMPLETELY OFF MY GAME.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.289
LUCAS, YOU DON'T HAVE GAME.

08:42.322 --> 08:44.958
WHATEVER. I'M CALLING
THIS DATE OFF.

08:44.992 --> 08:46.159
NO! NO!

08:46.193 --> 08:47.728
YOU CANNOT DO THAT!

08:47.761 --> 08:50.130
SURE I CAN. I'LL BE
DOING BOTH OF US A FAVOR.

08:50.163 --> 08:53.166
I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS
IF I DIDN'T THINK YOU TWO
WOULD HAVE FUN TOGETHER.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.770
AND FUN IS GOOD, RIGHT?

08:56.804 --> 08:59.072
LIKE, YOU ENJOY FUN, RIGHT?

08:59.106 --> 09:00.608
YEAH, SURE.

09:01.975 --> 09:04.044
I MEAN...
COME WITH US
ON THE DATE.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.313
I HEAR IT'S GONNA BE
A LOT OF FUN.

09:06.346 --> 09:08.916
AND WEIRD. HAVEN'T YOU
EVER HEARD THE PHRASE
"THREE'S A CROWD"?

09:08.949 --> 09:11.018
FINE. DON'T COME ALONE.
YOU CAN BRING CALEB.

09:11.051 --> 09:14.254
NO. NO, I'M SORRY.
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
THAT'S NOT HAPPENING.

09:14.287 --> 09:16.256
COME ON,
IT'S JUST ONE NIGHT.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.891
YOU GOT ME INTO THIS MESS,

09:17.925 --> 09:20.093
AND NOW YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO HELP ME DEAL WITH IT.

09:25.298 --> 09:28.235
I'M GOING THIS AFTERNOON,
RIGHT AFTER SCHOOL.

09:28.268 --> 09:30.370
ARE YOU SURE THAT'S SAFE?

09:30.403 --> 09:32.005
NO.

09:32.039 --> 09:33.273
ARIA.

09:33.306 --> 09:35.575
HEY.

09:37.044 --> 09:38.746
UH, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

09:38.779 --> 09:41.148
WE WERE-- WE WERE
JUST SAYING GOODBYE.

09:41.181 --> 09:44.017
YEAH, THAT'S NOT WHAT
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT.

09:44.051 --> 09:45.585
Oh.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.223
OH. OKAY. UM...

09:50.257 --> 09:52.693
WELL, I WOULD SAY
YOU HAD REALLY GOOD
MASTERY OF THE MATERIAL,

09:52.726 --> 09:54.662
EXCELLENT EYE CONTACT
WITH THE STUDENTS,

09:54.695 --> 09:58.632
BUT YOUR HANDWRITING
COULD USE SOME
IMPROVEMENT, THOUGH.

09:58.666 --> 10:01.201
YEAH, THAT'S NOT
IT EITHER, BUT THANKS.

10:01.234 --> 10:03.971
UM, MIKE LEFT HIS KEYS
AT HOME TODAY,

10:04.004 --> 10:06.173
AND I'VE GOT A FACULTY
MEETING AFTER SCHOOL.

10:06.206 --> 10:09.009
CAN YOU TAKE THESE
BY HIS PICKUP GAME AT
THE PART AFTER SCHOOL?

10:09.042 --> 10:11.311
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.
THANKS.

10:11.344 --> 10:13.280
UM... AND NOW
THAT YOU MENTION IT,

10:13.313 --> 10:15.749
THE WHOLE "NOT SEEING
YOUR FRIENDS" THING

10:15.783 --> 10:18.652
SHOULD PROBABLY EXTEND
TO THE SCHOOL HALLWAYS,
AS WELL.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.325
Female Vocalist:
 * MY HEART YEARNS

10:25.358 --> 10:27.661
* AND MY HEART ACHES

10:31.398 --> 10:33.100
* MY HEART HIDES

10:33.133 --> 10:35.268
* IN A CASSETTE TAPE

10:35.302 --> 10:38.138
THAT DATE IS
GONNA BE A DISASTER.

10:38.171 --> 10:40.340
WELL, YOU'RE HIS
"BRO-MATE." HELP HIM OUT.

10:40.373 --> 10:43.276
I TRIED, BUT HE GETS
NAUSEOUS JUST TALKING
ABOUT IT.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.878
AND I'M ON THE BOTTOM BUNK.

10:44.912 --> 10:46.079
HE HAS BUNK BEDS?

10:46.113 --> 10:48.015
OH, AND TOYS,
IN LITTLE BOXES.

10:48.048 --> 10:49.850
OKAY, THEY'RE COLLECTIBLES.

10:53.787 --> 10:55.122
YOU KNOW HE WANTS US
TO GO WITH THEM.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.825
I KNOW. IT'S
PRETTY LAME, HUH?

10:57.858 --> 11:00.427
YEAH.
 * WAKE UP, WAKE UP

11:00.460 --> 11:03.130
* IT'S DIFFERENT,
 IT'S DIFFERENT,
 IT'S DIFFERENT *

11:03.163 --> 11:04.832
SHOULD WE?

11:04.865 --> 11:05.933
NO.

11:12.005 --> 11:15.308
UNLESS...
SERIOUSLY?

11:15.342 --> 11:17.745
THE KID'S GONNA
SWALLOW HIS OWN TONGUE
IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.379
NO, SERIOUSLY,
YOU'RE GONNA GO
OUT WITH ME?

11:19.412 --> 11:20.914
I'M NOT GOING OUT
WITH YOU.

11:20.948 --> 11:22.950
I'M ACCOMPANYING
LUCAS AND DANIELLE,

11:22.983 --> 11:26.386
AND YOU HAPPEN TO BE
DOING THE SAME THING.

11:26.419 --> 11:29.757
WE'LL BE HIS WINGMEN,
OR WING PEOPLE,

11:29.790 --> 11:32.159
BUT THAT'S IT,
YOU GOT IT?

11:32.192 --> 11:34.127
GOT IT.

11:34.161 --> 11:35.462
GOOD.

11:35.495 --> 11:38.065
( lyrics continue
 indistinctly )

11:47.040 --> 11:49.009
Man: RADIOLOGY,
 DIAL THE OPERATOR.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.744
RADIOLOGY,
 DIAL THE OPERATOR.

11:54.347 --> 11:57.017
SPENCER, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

11:57.050 --> 12:00.888
WE NEED TO TALK.
I'M SORRY, THIS IS
KIND OF IMPORTANT.

12:00.921 --> 12:02.489
COULD YOU...

12:02.522 --> 12:04.491
LIKE, NOT BE HERE
RIGHT NOW?

12:08.195 --> 12:11.064
WHAT DID YOU GIVE
TO MELISSA OUTSIDE
OF OUR HOUSE,

12:11.098 --> 12:13.066
AND WHAT DID SHE TELL YOU?

12:13.100 --> 12:14.467
IT'S COMPLICATED.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.336
OKAY, WELL, LET ME MAKE IT
A BIT EASIER FOR YOU.

12:16.369 --> 12:19.072
IAN TRIED TO KILL ME.
WHAT? ARE YOU OKAY?

12:19.106 --> 12:20.941
FOR NOW.

12:20.974 --> 12:23.210
BUT HOW 'BOUT YOU TELL ME
WHAT YOU KNOW BEFORE
HE TRIES AGAIN?

12:30.117 --> 12:31.852
SHE WANTED MEDS.
SUPPLIES.

12:31.885 --> 12:33.854
AND YOU WERE JUST HAPPY
TO HAND THEM OVER?

12:33.887 --> 12:36.089
IAN MIGHT BE HIDING OUT
NEXT DOOR TO MY HOUSE.

12:36.123 --> 12:38.826
NO, MELISSA SAID HE'D
ONLY TELL HER WHERE HE WAS
ONCE SHE HAD THE DRUGS,

12:38.859 --> 12:40.527
BUT THAT IT WAS SOMEWHERE
OUTSIDE OF ROSEWOOD.

12:42.462 --> 12:43.997
WHY DID YOU HELP HER?

12:44.031 --> 12:45.232
HONESTLY?

12:45.265 --> 12:47.334
'CAUSE I FEEL PARTLY
RESPONSIBLE

12:47.367 --> 12:49.169
FOR MELISSA CHARGING
BACK TO IAN.

12:49.202 --> 12:51.171
HOW COULD I NOT HELP?

12:51.204 --> 12:52.806
I DIDN'T GIVE HER
EVERYTHING THAT
SHE ASKED FOR,

12:52.840 --> 12:53.941
SOME OF THE PAINKILLERS
SHE WANTED.

12:53.974 --> 12:56.176
I'D LOSE MY JOB
IF I DID THAT.

12:56.209 --> 12:58.178
SPENCER, PLEASE,
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.580
I HAD NO IDEA THAT YOU
WERE A PART OF THIS.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.816
I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU
GET HURT AGAIN.

13:02.850 --> 13:05.218
( scoffs ) IT'S KIND OF
TOO LATE FOR THAT.

13:05.252 --> 13:06.820
YOU NEED
TO LEAVE THIS ALONE.

13:06.854 --> 13:08.521
I CAN'T LEAVE THIS ALONE.

13:08.555 --> 13:10.390
AND I NEED YOUR HELP.

13:10.423 --> 13:13.026
EVERY TIME I GAMBLE
WITH YOU AND YOUR SISTER,

13:13.060 --> 13:14.361
PEOPLE END UP GETTING HURT.

13:14.394 --> 13:15.863
I WON'T LET THAT
HAPPEN AGAIN.

13:15.896 --> 13:19.599
WREN, WILL YOU HELP ME
FIND IAN OR NOT?

13:19.632 --> 13:22.369
I'M SORRY. NO.

13:39.152 --> 13:42.489
IT'S AMAZING
HOW SLOWLY TIME PASSES

13:42.522 --> 13:44.457
WHEN YOU KEEP
LOOKING AT A CLOCK,
ISN'T IT?

13:44.491 --> 13:46.593
TOTALLY.

13:46.626 --> 13:48.295
DID YOU SPEAK
WITH YOUR FRIENDS

13:48.328 --> 13:50.931
ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE
COMING IN HERE ON YOUR OWN?

13:50.964 --> 13:52.866
WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO TALK, REMEMBER?

13:52.900 --> 13:56.303
MY GUESS IS
YOU FIND YOUR WAYS.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.038
YOU'RE BEST FRIENDS.

13:58.071 --> 14:00.140
YOUR OPINIONS,
YOUR INTERACTIONS,

14:00.173 --> 14:01.574
ALL ARE IMPORTANT
TO ONE ANOTHER.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.276
SO WHY KEEP US APART?

14:04.411 --> 14:05.478
PERSPECTIVE.

14:07.047 --> 14:09.149
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU'RE
GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY

14:09.182 --> 14:11.118
TO LOOK AT SOMETHING
FROM A DIFFERENT
VANTAGE POINT,

14:11.151 --> 14:12.652
YOU SEE DIFFERENT THINGS.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.521
WHAT'S THE POINT OF
SEEING THINGS DIFFERENTLY

14:14.554 --> 14:16.023
IF YOU CAN'T SHARE
WITH YOUR FRIENDS?

14:16.056 --> 14:18.191
HANNA, I CAN HELP YOU.

14:18.225 --> 14:19.459
HELP ME WHAT?

14:19.492 --> 14:21.428
LET GO.

14:21.461 --> 14:25.032
I'VE TALKED WITH A LOT
OF YOUNG PEOPLE ABOUT LOSS.

14:25.065 --> 14:27.968
SOMETIMES IT'S FEELINGS
OF GUILT THAT'S HOLDING
THEM BACK,

14:28.001 --> 14:30.170
SOMETIMES
IT'S ANGER OR FEAR,

14:30.203 --> 14:32.940
SOMETIMES ALL THREE.

14:32.973 --> 14:34.942
THAT'D BE REALLY CRAZY, HUH?

14:34.975 --> 14:36.409
NO, NOT AT ALL.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.012
IT'S QUITE COMMON.

14:41.648 --> 14:45.118
ALISON IS STILL
HERE FOR YOU...

14:45.152 --> 14:46.353
FOR ALL OF YOU,
ISN'T SHE?

14:46.386 --> 14:49.189
YOU DON'T KNOW
THE HALF OF IT.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.958
MAYBE NOT.

14:50.991 --> 14:53.360
BUT WHATEVER YOU'RE FEELING,
YOU CAN MOVE PAST IT.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.262
YOU MAKE IT SOUND
LIKE IT'S UP TO ME.

14:55.295 --> 14:57.697
YOU... AND ALISON.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.633
I THINK YOU NEED TO HAVE
A CONVERSATION WITH HER.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.269
IT'S A LITTLE LATE FOR THAT.

15:02.302 --> 15:04.371
MAYBE NOT.

15:04.404 --> 15:10.677
PRETEND ALISON
IS SITTING HERE,
RIGHT NOW.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.545
I THOUGHT TALKING
TO EMPTY CHAIRS

15:12.579 --> 15:15.248
WAS THE KIND OF THING
PEOPLE COME HERE
TO STOP DOING.

15:15.282 --> 15:17.084
HUMOR ME.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.289
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
TO ALISON IF YOU COULD?

15:33.766 --> 15:35.135
I'D SAY TIME'S UP.

15:46.113 --> 15:48.215
( rock music playing )

15:55.088 --> 15:57.057
Male Vocalist:
 * EAGLE-EYED, FEATHER-LIGHT

15:57.090 --> 15:58.458
* RAZOR-SHARP
 JUST LIKE A KNIFE *

15:58.491 --> 16:00.193
* SYSTEMATIC,
 POST-TRAUMATIC *

16:00.227 --> 16:01.995
* GIRL IS ON THE BUY

16:02.029 --> 16:03.663
* BREATHE IN,
 LET IT OUT *

16:03.696 --> 16:06.499
* TEARS YOUR HEART
 AND SPIT IT OUT *

16:06.533 --> 16:08.101
* FACE DOWN IN THE DIRT

16:08.135 --> 16:10.637
* FALL IN LOVE,
 SHE'LL MAKE IT HURT *

16:10.670 --> 16:15.008
* AND WHEN SHE'S...

16:15.042 --> 16:16.409
MIKE, IT'S ME.

16:16.443 --> 16:18.278
STILL WONDERING
WHERE YOU ARE, OKAY?

16:18.311 --> 16:19.746
UM, I'M AT THE PARK.

16:19.779 --> 16:22.982
I'M TRYING TO GIVE YOU
YOUR KEYS, SO PICK UP.

16:24.217 --> 16:25.285
MIKE!

16:26.353 --> 16:27.687
HEY, MIKE!

16:27.720 --> 16:31.291
* SHE KNOWS
 SHE'S IN CONTROL *

16:31.324 --> 16:34.261
OH. SORRY.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.670
LEWIS. HEY.

16:43.703 --> 16:45.405
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
I CAN FIND MIKE?

16:45.438 --> 16:46.539
GOT ME.

16:46.573 --> 16:48.575
HE USUALLY PLAYS HERE,
THOUGH, RIGHT?

16:48.608 --> 16:50.677
NOT FOR THE LAST
COUPLE OF MONTHS, NO.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.479
NO. NO, NO, NO.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.481
HE USUALLY
PLAYS PICKUP HERE

16:54.514 --> 16:56.249
ALMOST EVERY DAY
AFTER SCHOOL.

16:56.283 --> 16:58.785
SO DO WE, AND I
HAVEN'T SEEN HIM. SORRY.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.299
HEY.

17:12.332 --> 17:13.633
HEY.

17:15.301 --> 17:17.104
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN
MY BROTHER, HAVE YOU?

17:17.137 --> 17:19.506
UH, NO. SORRY.

17:19.539 --> 17:20.673
WHAT, HE GIVE YOU
THE SLIP?

17:20.707 --> 17:22.675
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.444
I WAS ALWAYS LYING
ABOUT WHERE I WAS
WHEN I WAS HIS AGE.

17:25.478 --> 17:28.748
I DON'T REMEMBER A LOT
ABOUT THAT TIME, ACTUALLY.

17:28.781 --> 17:31.284
MOST OF WHAT I DO REMEMBER,
I WISH I COULD FORGET,
YOU KNOW?

17:34.887 --> 17:37.824
YOU KNOW
WHAT I DO REMEMBER?
YOUR PINK HAIR.

17:37.857 --> 17:39.426
REALLY?

17:39.459 --> 17:40.527
I THOUGHT IT WAS COOL.

17:40.560 --> 17:41.794
REALLY?!

17:41.828 --> 17:43.330
REALLY.

17:43.363 --> 17:46.699
I MEAN, YOU--
YOU ALWAYS DID
THE UNEXPECTED,

17:46.733 --> 17:49.469
AS OPPOSED TO ME.

17:49.502 --> 17:52.172
WHICH... I ALSO
THOUGHT WAS COOL.

17:54.474 --> 17:57.076
WELL, UH...

18:03.250 --> 18:05.418
HEY...

18:05.452 --> 18:07.754
I MISS THAT PINK HAIR.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.501
EMILY.

18:21.534 --> 18:23.670
I SAW THE WHOLE MEET.
YOU'RE SO GOOD.

18:23.703 --> 18:24.837
THANKS.

18:24.871 --> 18:26.306
AND I'M EVEN MORE
IMPRESSED BY THAT

18:26.339 --> 18:28.341
COMMITMENT LETTER
YOU GOT FROM DANBY.

18:28.375 --> 18:30.577
HOW'D YOU HEAR
ABOUT THAT?

18:30.610 --> 18:33.213
FROM YOUR MOM,
JUST LIKE EVERYBODY
ELSE AT THE POOL.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.748
SHE IS TOTALLY STOKED,
AND SO AM I.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.884
I MEAN, DANBY IS
A BEAUTIFUL CAMPUS,

18:37.917 --> 18:40.187
AND I COULD
COME VISIT, AND...

18:41.521 --> 18:42.722
WHAT'S WRONG?

18:48.395 --> 18:50.463
OH, MY GOD, YOU DON'T
WANT TO GO TO DANBY?

18:54.667 --> 18:56.769
OR YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO COME TO DANBY?

18:56.803 --> 18:58.338
NO, IT'S NOT THAT.

19:00.573 --> 19:02.509
THAT LETTER IS NOT REAL.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.744
THE COACH FROM DANBY
DIDN'T WRITE IT.

19:04.777 --> 19:06.846
I... I DID.

19:09.316 --> 19:11.684
WOW, SO YOU JUST
MAILED IT TO YOURSELF?

19:11.718 --> 19:14.354
YEAH. SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

19:15.522 --> 19:17.257
EMILY.

19:17.290 --> 19:20.493
GREAT JOB, HONEY!
FANTASTIC!

19:20.527 --> 19:21.694
CONGRATULATIONS.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.463
THE FIELD WAS
KIND OF WEAK.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.832
NO, THEY WERE GOOD,
BUT YOU WERE BETTER.

19:26.966 --> 19:29.302
UH, MOM, THIS IS SAMARA.

19:29.336 --> 19:31.771
HI, SAMARA.
PAM FIELDS.

19:33.306 --> 19:35.708
EMILY HAS TOLD ME
SO MUCH ABOUT YOU,

19:35.742 --> 19:37.544
AND IT'S NICE
TO FINALLY MEET.

19:37.577 --> 19:39.446
LIKEWISE.

19:39.479 --> 19:42.382
YOU KNOW, I SENT VIDEO
OF YOUR WINNING LEG
OF THE RELAY

19:42.415 --> 19:44.451
TO YOUR DAD,
AND HE WAS SO EXCITED.

19:44.484 --> 19:45.885
YOU MUST BE OVERJOYED.

19:47.754 --> 19:50.423
WHY DON'T WE HAVE
A CELEBRATION TONIGHT?
MOM...

19:50.457 --> 19:53.226
I KNOW INVITING YOUR OTHER
FRIENDS PROBABLY ISN'T SUCH
A GOOD IDEA RIGHT NOW.

19:53.260 --> 19:54.427
RIGHT, SO I DON'T--

19:54.461 --> 19:56.463
SAMARA, WOULD YOU
LIKE TO COME?

19:59.566 --> 20:01.301
I'D LOVE TO.

20:01.334 --> 20:03.436
SEVEN O'CLOCK?
OKAY, GREAT.

20:03.470 --> 20:04.804
I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

20:09.276 --> 20:10.510
RELAX.

20:10.543 --> 20:13.012
IF I'M THERE
AND THE TRUTH SLIPS OUT,

20:13.045 --> 20:14.714
YOUR MOM
WON'T GET SO ANGRY.

20:24.591 --> 20:27.494
"WE'LL BE LATE.
TAKE CARE OF YOUR SISTER..."

20:27.527 --> 20:30.597
EXCLAMATION POINT.
"MOM."

20:30.630 --> 20:32.432
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A FUN EVENING.

20:46.513 --> 20:47.447
MELISSA?

20:48.648 --> 20:50.917
( shower running )
YOU HOME?

21:21.047 --> 21:23.316
( shower stops )

21:37.464 --> 21:38.498
SPENCER?

21:40.032 --> 21:41.300
SPENCER?

21:54.381 --> 21:57.617
OKAY, SO, IF IAN'S
NOT NEXT DOOR, WHERE IS HE?

21:57.650 --> 21:59.352
AND WHERE'S HE GOING?

21:59.386 --> 22:01.020
AND WHY IS MELISSA
GOING WITH HIM?

22:01.053 --> 22:02.555
RIGHT.

22:02.589 --> 22:04.391
THINGS DON'T
USUALLY WORK OUT WELL

22:04.424 --> 22:05.858
FOR THE WIVES
OF MURDERERS.

22:05.892 --> 22:09.095
DO YOU... DO YOU THINK
THAT HE'D HURT HER?

22:09.128 --> 22:10.797
I DON'T KNOW.

22:12.932 --> 22:15.101
I WISH I COULD JUST COME
STAY OVER AT YOUR HOUSE.

22:15.134 --> 22:16.503
ME TOO.

22:16.536 --> 22:18.671
I'M HOME ALONE
WITH THE DOORS LOCKED,

22:18.705 --> 22:21.508
AND I'M CREEPED OUT.

22:21.541 --> 22:24.677
( car approaching )

22:24.711 --> 22:26.413
I gotta go.
My parents are here.

22:26.446 --> 22:27.514
OKAY.

22:37.757 --> 22:40.092
( door closes )

22:40.126 --> 22:41.394
MOM?

22:43.029 --> 22:44.096
DAD?

23:01.814 --> 23:03.983
( gasps )

23:04.016 --> 23:05.084
BOO.

23:09.956 --> 23:11.090
HEY.

23:11.123 --> 23:12.492
HEY!

23:12.525 --> 23:14.494
WHAT?

23:14.527 --> 23:15.495
WHERE WERE YOU ALL DAY?

23:15.528 --> 23:16.929
WHAT'S IT TO YOU?

23:16.963 --> 23:19.198
WELL, I...

23:19.231 --> 23:21.934
I WAS TRYING TO FIND YOU
ALL DAY TO GIVE YOU
YOUR KEYS.

23:21.968 --> 23:24.103
SO, GIVE THEM TO ME.

23:24.136 --> 23:25.404
NO.

23:26.506 --> 23:28.140
LET'S FORGET ABOUT TODAY.

23:28.174 --> 23:30.042
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN
EVERY OTHER DAY, HUH?

23:30.076 --> 23:31.678
BECAUSE THE GUYS
YOU PLAY BALL WITH

23:31.711 --> 23:33.079
HARDLY REMEMBER
WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE.

23:33.112 --> 23:35.181
PLACES. HERE AND THERE.

23:35.214 --> 23:38.685
BUT... BUT THAT'S WHAT
YOU PLAN ON TELLING
MOM AND DAD?

23:38.718 --> 23:40.520
YOU KNOW THAT
THEY'RE GONNA FIND OUT.

23:40.553 --> 23:42.489
NOT FROM YOU, THEY'RE NOT,

23:42.522 --> 23:44.123
'CAUSE IF YOU TELL THEM,

23:44.156 --> 23:46.192
I'LL TELL THEM ABOUT
YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS
SNEAKING AROUND TOWN

23:46.225 --> 23:48.828
WHILE YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE HAVING A TIME OUT.

23:48.861 --> 23:50.830
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

23:50.863 --> 23:53.666
MOM'S MOVED IN.
THINGS ARE GOING
BACK TO NORMAL.

23:53.700 --> 23:54.867
YOU THINK
THAT'S ALL IT TAKES?

23:54.901 --> 23:56.736
THE FOUR OF US EAT
PANCAKES TOGETHER,

23:56.769 --> 23:58.905
AND EVERYTHING'S OKAY?

23:58.938 --> 24:00.573
THINGS AREN'T
HOW THEY USED TO BE.

24:02.041 --> 24:03.943
THEY NEVER WILL BE.

24:03.976 --> 24:05.645
HEY.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.785
Female Vocalist:
 * ANGEL IN THE CORNER

24:12.819 --> 24:14.887
* WATCHING OVER ME
 REFILL?

24:14.921 --> 24:16.255
THANKS.

24:16.288 --> 24:19.058
* ...SINCE I FELT
 THIS WAY *

24:19.091 --> 24:20.560
YOU TWO DOING OKAY?

24:20.593 --> 24:21.861
GREAT.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.796
MM-HM. FINE.

24:23.830 --> 24:26.032
OKAY, WELL, WE HAVE
TO LEAVE FOR THE MOVIE
IN 10 MINUTES.

24:26.065 --> 24:27.600
MM-HM.

24:27.634 --> 24:29.802
( vocalist vocalizing )

24:30.870 --> 24:32.639
( sighs )
NOTE TO SELF:

24:32.672 --> 24:35.608
IT'S A LITTLE TOO EARLY
TO BE CHANNELING
MY INNER MOM.

24:35.642 --> 24:37.076
IT'S A LITTLE LATE
FOR THAT, ANYWAY.

24:37.109 --> 24:38.678
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
SHE'S TOTALLY INTO HIM.

24:38.711 --> 24:40.279
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

24:40.312 --> 24:43.215
MAYBE THEY HAVE
DIFFERENT MATING RITUALS
IN YEARBOOK CLUB.

24:43.249 --> 24:45.251
WHAT ARE YOU,
THE EXPERT NOW?

24:45.284 --> 24:48.120
I CAN READ YOU
PRETTY WELL.

24:48.154 --> 24:50.890
WELL, TRUST ME,
IT'S GOING GREAT.

24:50.923 --> 24:53.125
THIS BLOWS.

24:53.159 --> 24:55.628
WHAT? I'M HAVING
A GOOD TIME.

24:55.662 --> 24:56.796
ARE YOU?

24:56.829 --> 25:00.199
I WOULD BE.
I LIKE YOU,

25:00.232 --> 25:02.735
BUT...

25:02.769 --> 25:05.738
TELL ME YOU HAVEN'T
NOTICED HOW SHE KEEPS
CHECKING YOU OUT.

25:08.207 --> 25:11.110
( soft chuckle )
HANNA?

25:11.143 --> 25:12.712
UH, I DON'T THINK SO.

25:12.745 --> 25:16.182
SHE COMES OVER HERE,
LIKE, EVERY 20 SECONDS.

25:16.215 --> 25:17.917
SHE'S TOTALLY
STILL INTO YOU.

25:17.950 --> 25:20.653
WELL, THEN, WHY
WOULD SHE BRING CALEB?

25:20.687 --> 25:23.289
TO MAKE YOU JEALOUS.

25:26.859 --> 25:27.994
AREN'T YOU?

25:29.128 --> 25:30.296
NO.

25:31.598 --> 25:33.165
I WOULD BE.

25:37.804 --> 25:41.173
Emily: THAT WAS
MY FIFTH BIRTHDAY PARTY,
MY FIRST DIVE.

25:41.207 --> 25:43.175
Samara: OH, LOOK
HOW CUTE YOU ARE.

25:43.209 --> 25:44.777
OH, THAT WAS SO LONG AGO.

25:47.246 --> 25:49.982
( Samara laughing )
THAT WAS THE BEST
BIRTHDAY EVER.

25:50.016 --> 25:51.684
I CAN'T BELIEVE I WORE
MY HAIR LIKE THAT.

25:51.718 --> 25:53.853
HI.

25:53.886 --> 25:55.688
HI.

25:55.722 --> 25:57.690
DID YOU
MAKE THIS SCRAPBOOK?

25:57.724 --> 26:00.326
I DID. ONE OF MANY.

26:00.359 --> 26:03.029
DID YOU USE A GLUE GUN
TO STICK THE RICE PAPER
TO THE BINDING?

26:03.062 --> 26:04.931
WHAT ELSE?

26:04.964 --> 26:07.066
YOU KNOW, THAT'S
THE FIRST THING
I REMEMBER

26:07.099 --> 26:09.201
ASKING FOR FOR CHRISTMAS.

26:09.235 --> 26:12.071
I THINK I STUCK MYSELF
TO EVERY ROOM IN THE HOUSE.

26:12.104 --> 26:14.607
I STILL USE IT FOR SOME
OF MY JEWELRY PROJECTS.

26:14.641 --> 26:16.008
REALLY?

26:16.042 --> 26:17.844
YEAH, MY MOM AND I,
WE MADE SOME SCRAPBOOKS

26:17.877 --> 26:19.211
LIKE THIS
WHEN I WAS A KID,

26:19.245 --> 26:21.948
BUT THEY NEVER
TURNED OUT THIS WELL.

26:21.981 --> 26:25.217
YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING
ABOUT MAKING A NEW ONE,

26:25.251 --> 26:28.955
SORT OF ALONG THE LINES
OF A ROSEWOOD-TO-DANBY THEME.

26:28.988 --> 26:30.957
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

26:30.990 --> 26:33.359
YOU KNOW, EM, YOU AND I
SHOULD PROBABLY TAKE
A TOUR OF DANBY,

26:33.392 --> 26:35.261
JUST GET
THE LAY OF THE LAND.

26:35.294 --> 26:37.396
YEAH, THERE'S PLENTY
OF TIME FOR THAT.

26:37.429 --> 26:40.166
HONEY, IT'S NEVER TOO SOON
TO START DOING A LITTLE
BIT OF RESEARCH.

26:40.199 --> 26:42.234
ACTUALLY, WHAT I SHOULD DO
IS CALL YOUR SCOUT...

26:42.268 --> 26:44.103
...AND TALK TO HIM.
MOM.

26:44.136 --> 26:47.106
HONEY, I'VE GOT TO CALL
AND THANK HIM FOR
THE GIFTS, ANYWAY.

26:52.378 --> 26:53.813
THE TRUTH IS...

26:53.846 --> 26:56.248
THE TRUTH IS,
DANBY HAS A GOOD TEAM,

26:56.282 --> 26:58.751
BUT SO DO A LOT
OF OTHER PLACES.

26:58.785 --> 27:00.319
MY DAD KNOWS
THE COACH AT STANFORD,

27:00.352 --> 27:01.721
AND THEY HAVE
A GREAT TEAM.

27:01.754 --> 27:03.255
I WAS JUST TELLING EMILY
THAT I THINK

27:03.289 --> 27:06.826
A LOT OF DIFFERENT SCHOOLS
WILL BE INTERESTED IN HER.

27:06.859 --> 27:08.227
YOU THINK SO?

27:08.260 --> 27:10.229
WITH HER TIMES?
TOTALLY.

27:10.262 --> 27:12.765
I WOULDN'T GET LOCKED
INTO DANBY.

27:12.799 --> 27:14.166
PLAY IT COOL, AND WAIT
FOR THE OTHER OFFERS

27:14.200 --> 27:15.902
TO ROLL IN
DURING SENIOR YEAR.

27:15.935 --> 27:18.170
THAT'S WHEN
THE REAL ACTION STARTS.

27:18.204 --> 27:20.206
IF YOU CONTACT
THE COACH NOW,

27:20.239 --> 27:23.910
OTHER PLACES MIGHT GET
THE WRONG IDEA.

27:23.943 --> 27:28.347
WELL, THAT SEEMS
TO MAKE A REASONABLE
AMOUNT OF SENSE.

27:28.380 --> 27:29.982
EM?

27:30.016 --> 27:32.719
UM... YEAH. FOR SURE.

27:39.391 --> 27:40.727
YOU GOTTA HELP ME,
GUYS.

27:40.760 --> 27:42.261
I'M CIRCLING
THE DRAIN HERE.

27:42.294 --> 27:44.463
I FEEL YOUR PAIN.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

27:44.496 --> 27:47.166
DANIELLE STILL THINKS
THAT YOU'RE CRUSHING ON ME.

27:47.199 --> 27:48.801
WHAT?! NO, I TOLD HER
I WAS OVER YOU,

27:48.835 --> 27:50.402
AND, JUST TO BE CLEAR...

27:50.436 --> 27:52.004
OKAY, I GET IT,
I GET IT.

27:52.038 --> 27:53.840
BUT SHE DOESN'T.

27:53.873 --> 27:56.175
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
IT'S GONNA BE LIKE
IN YEARBOOK TOMORROW?

27:56.208 --> 27:57.977
THEY'RE GONNA DEDICATE
A SPECIAL PAGE

27:58.010 --> 27:59.846
TO HOW STUPID I WAS
TO THINK THAT I COULD

27:59.879 --> 28:01.080
GO OUT WITH
SOMEONE LIKE HER,

28:01.113 --> 28:02.715
AND I'LL
HAVE TO DESIGN IT.

28:02.749 --> 28:05.752
I GUESS I WAS JUST
KIDDING MYSELF,

28:05.785 --> 28:08.888
THINKING THAT I COULD
LET GO OF WHO EVERYONE
ELSE THINKS I AM

28:08.921 --> 28:11.023
AND JUST BE MYSELF.

28:16.228 --> 28:18.765
WELL, THANKS FOR TRYING
TO ACHIEVE THE UNACHIEVABLE.

28:22.334 --> 28:23.936
Caleb: YOU KNOW
WHAT'S A DRAG?

28:23.970 --> 28:25.337
IS HOW MUCH BETTER
LUCAS WOULD BE

28:25.371 --> 28:26.906
IF HE DIDN'T CARE WHAT
EVERYBODY ELSE THOUGHT.

28:26.939 --> 28:28.274
I KNOW, RIGHT?

28:30.109 --> 28:31.310
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
TO HELP HIM?

28:33.913 --> 28:35.281
PUT YOUR ARM AROUND ME.

28:35.314 --> 28:36.849
WHAT?

28:36.883 --> 28:38.050
JUST PUT
YOUR ARM AROUND ME.

28:54.801 --> 28:56.769
( sighs )
NICE WORK.

28:56.803 --> 28:58.104
IT WAS EASY.

28:58.137 --> 28:59.872
WELL, I'M NOT.

29:01.440 --> 29:03.509
( door closes )

29:09.181 --> 29:11.250
( door opens )

29:35.842 --> 29:37.143
MELISSA, I'VE
HAD SECOND THOUGHTS

29:37.176 --> 29:39.078
ABOUT THE INJURIES
YOU'VE DESCRIBED.

29:39.111 --> 29:41.580
I'M CONCERNED IAN
COULD HAVE A STAPH INFECTION.

29:41.613 --> 29:46.118
I'M GONNA HAVE
TO INSIST THAT I SEE HIM
BEFORE YOU GO ANYWHERE.

29:46.152 --> 29:48.821
I'LL BRING WHATEVER DRUGS
ARE NECESSARY.

29:50.990 --> 29:52.358
NO, MELISSA.

29:52.391 --> 29:54.293
I COME WITH YOU,
OR NO DEAL.

29:57.864 --> 29:59.331
SHE BOUGHT IT.

29:59.365 --> 30:01.133
SHE STILL DOESN'T KNOW
WHERE IAN'S HIDING,

30:01.167 --> 30:03.369
BUT SHE'LL CALL ME TOMORROW
WHEN SHE FINDS OUT...

30:03.402 --> 30:07.206
...SO I CAN GO WITH HER.
AND I'LL BE
RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

30:08.574 --> 30:10.176
Male Vocalist:
 * COME ON

30:10.209 --> 30:12.178
* COME ON

30:12.211 --> 30:15.414
* PUT YOUR HANDS
 INTO THE FIRE *

30:15.447 --> 30:16.983
* EXPLAIN

30:17.016 --> 30:18.851
* EXPLAIN

30:18.885 --> 30:21.921
* AS I TURN,
 I MEET THE POWER *

30:21.954 --> 30:23.222
* THIS TIME

30:23.255 --> 30:25.157
* THIS TIME

30:25.191 --> 30:28.160
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME
TELL DANIELLE THAT
YOU'RE A PEEPING TOM.

30:28.194 --> 30:29.261
I WON'T.

30:30.963 --> 30:32.398
I JUST WANTED TO COME OVER
AND SAY THANK YOU

30:32.431 --> 30:34.433
FOR WHAT
YOU DID LAST NIGHT.

30:34.466 --> 30:38.104
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE COME
A LONG WAY FROM BEING
ONE OF ALISON'S POSSE.

30:38.137 --> 30:41.307
WHATEVER.
NO, SERIOUSLY.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.409
WHAT YOU DID,
YOU DID FOR ME,

30:43.442 --> 30:46.278
AND THERE WASN'T
ANYTHING IN IT FOR YOU.

30:46.312 --> 30:48.447
THAT MEANS A LOT.

30:57.023 --> 30:59.258
( door opens )

30:59.291 --> 31:01.660
HANNA! YOUR APPOINTMENT
ISN'T UNTIL NEXT WEEK.

31:01.693 --> 31:03.562
I KNOW, BUT...

31:03.595 --> 31:05.397
I NEED TO TALK.

31:05.431 --> 31:08.234
Male Vocalist:
 * ...PUT YOUR HANDS
 INTO THE FIRE *

31:08.267 --> 31:12.238
* EXPLAIN, EXPLAIN

31:12.271 --> 31:15.241
* AS I TURN
 AND MEET THE POWER *

31:15.274 --> 31:16.275
* THIS TIME

31:16.308 --> 31:18.410
* THIS TIME

31:18.444 --> 31:21.647
* TURNING WHITE
 AND SENSES DYING *

31:21.680 --> 31:23.282
HEY, NEED A RIDE?

31:23.315 --> 31:26.418
USED TO BE FUN WHEN
I TOOK YOU TO SCHOOL.

31:26.452 --> 31:28.420
YEAH. YEAH,
THAT'D BE GREAT.

31:31.090 --> 31:33.192
WE'RE HERE FOR YOU,
YOUR MOM AND I.

31:33.225 --> 31:34.426
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

31:34.460 --> 31:36.295
YEAH, I DO.
OKAY.

31:36.328 --> 31:38.564
AND I'M GLAD THAT
THE THINGS THAT
USED TO BE FUN

31:38.597 --> 31:40.066
ARE BECOMING FUN AGAIN.

31:40.099 --> 31:41.968
ME TOO.
( door opens )

31:42.001 --> 31:44.336
HEY, MIKE.

31:44.370 --> 31:46.605
HOW WAS THE GAME
YESTERDAY?

31:46.638 --> 31:49.308
GREAT, LIKE ALWAYS.

31:49.341 --> 31:52.111
ARIA WATCHED FOR
A COUPLE OF MINUTES.

31:52.144 --> 31:53.212
YEAH?

31:59.418 --> 32:01.353
WANT A RIDE TO SCHOOL?

32:01.387 --> 32:03.255
I'M COOL.

32:03.289 --> 32:05.524
SURE, I MEAN WE COULD
STOP AND GET A...

32:05.557 --> 32:09.061
A CUP OF COFFEE.

32:09.095 --> 32:10.329
IS HE OKAY?

32:11.430 --> 32:13.699
YEAH, I THINK SO.

32:13.732 --> 32:16.402
HM. ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL LEAVE IN FIVE.

32:16.435 --> 32:17.503
OKAY.

32:22.274 --> 32:25.144
WHAT YOU SAID YESTERDAY
ABOUT SEEING THINGS
DIFFERENTLY--

32:25.177 --> 32:27.446
UM, I-I WENT ON A DATE.

32:27.479 --> 32:29.215
A-A DOUBLE DATE.

32:29.248 --> 32:32.084
Actually, it wasn't
even really...
HANNA. BREATHE.

32:32.118 --> 32:33.185
( sighs )

32:35.087 --> 32:36.455
YOU WERE RIGHT.

32:36.488 --> 32:40.426
ALISON IS STILL
WITH US. WITH ME.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.394
MORE THAN I WANT.

32:42.428 --> 32:43.529
WHY MORE?

32:43.562 --> 32:45.631
OUR FRIENDSHIP WAS WORK.

32:47.133 --> 32:48.634
LIKE-- LIKE YOU HAD
TO IMPRESS HER

32:48.667 --> 32:51.070
TO MAKE HER LIKE YOU,
AND...

32:51.103 --> 32:53.639
THAT MEANT DOING THINGS
THAT MAYBE YOU DIDN'T FEEL

32:53.672 --> 32:55.441
SO GOOD ABOUT DOING.

32:57.276 --> 33:00.346
SOMETIMES BAD THINGS.

33:00.379 --> 33:04.650
IF IT WAS SO HARD,
WHY WAS IT SO IMPORTANT
TO BE HER FRIEND?

33:06.418 --> 33:09.055
SHE COULD MAKE YOU
FEEL SPECIAL,

33:09.088 --> 33:12.591
AND THAT SEEMED
WORTH IT THEN.

33:12.624 --> 33:14.693
AND NOW?

33:18.297 --> 33:20.366
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE
TO SAY TO ALISON?

33:23.335 --> 33:24.670
JUST THAT...

33:24.703 --> 33:26.305
TO ALISON.

33:27.339 --> 33:29.408
( chuckles softly )

33:33.279 --> 33:34.780
ALISON...

33:36.482 --> 33:39.685
YOU WERE THE BEST FRIEND
I EVER HAD...

33:41.620 --> 33:43.789
AND THAT MEANT A LOT TO ME.

33:43.822 --> 33:47.293
YOU MEANT A LOT TO ME.

33:47.326 --> 33:52.030
BUT YOU WERE ALSO
THE WORST ENEMY
I EVER HAD...

33:54.133 --> 33:57.169
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE
IT TOOK ME THIS LONG
TO REALIZE THAT.

33:59.805 --> 34:02.074
HOW DO YOU THINK ALISON
WOULD RESPOND TO THAT?

34:09.281 --> 34:10.681
WELL, LOOK AT YOU.

34:10.716 --> 34:14.353
ALL INDEPENDENT
AND IN TOUCH WITH
YOUR FEELINGS.

34:14.386 --> 34:17.322
I'LL BET YOU'RE PRETTY
IMPRESSED WITH YOURSELF
RIGHT NOW, AREN'T YOU?

34:18.456 --> 34:19.658
YEAH.

34:22.161 --> 34:23.429
I'M PROUD OF YOU, HANNA.

34:23.462 --> 34:26.331
I DON'T CARE.
OF COURSE YOU DON'T.

34:26.364 --> 34:29.868
TODAY... YOU'VE GOT
DOCTOR DO-OVER THERE

34:29.900 --> 34:33.472
READY TO PAT YOU
ON THE BACK FOR TALKING
TO AN EMPTY CHAIR.

34:33.505 --> 34:34.672
I DON'T NEED HER EITHER.

34:35.774 --> 34:37.309
WELL, YOU NEED SOMEONE.

34:38.909 --> 34:41.313
LOW SELF-ESTEEM
LEADS TO "HEFTY HANNA."

34:42.880 --> 34:44.815
WASN'T THAT COVERED
WELLNESS CLASS?

34:44.850 --> 34:48.520
I HAVE OTHER FRIENDS.

34:48.554 --> 34:49.855
REAL FRIENDS.

34:49.888 --> 34:51.723
YOU HAVE WHAT I GAVE YOU.

34:56.928 --> 34:58.497
YOU THINK
YOUR THREE GAL-PALS

34:58.530 --> 34:59.898
WILL BE WITH YOU
FOREVER, DON'T YOU?

34:59.931 --> 35:03.169
NEWS FLASH: YOU'RE
ALREADY LOSING THEM.

35:03.202 --> 35:07.273
THEY'RE GONNA MOVE ON,
HANNA, AND YOU'RE NOT.

35:07.306 --> 35:09.741
AND YOU KNOW WHO
YOU'LL BE LEFT WITH?

35:09.775 --> 35:11.543
ME.

35:11.577 --> 35:13.645
I'LL ALWAYS BE WITH YOU.

35:13.679 --> 35:16.615
I'M THE ONLY ONE
THAT CAN MAKE YOU HAPPY,

35:16.648 --> 35:18.517
THE ONLY ONE THAT'LL
TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

35:22.321 --> 35:24.390
I'M THE ONLY ONE
THAT YOU CAN COUNT ON.

35:26.192 --> 35:28.126
THEN I'D RATHER BE ALONE.

35:30.462 --> 35:31.897
YOU WON'T LAST A WEEK.

35:31.930 --> 35:33.932
AT LEAST I'LL BE ALIVE.

35:33.965 --> 35:37.769
YOU CAN'T REACH
INTO MY LIFE ANYMORE,

35:37.803 --> 35:40.472
NOT UNLESS I LET YOU.

35:40.506 --> 35:42.741
YOU'RE GONE,

35:42.774 --> 35:45.277
AND I AM
SO OVER MISSING YOU.

36:12.404 --> 36:14.673
HEY, YOU?

36:14.706 --> 36:16.808
HAVE YOU TRANSFERRED HERE
WITHOUT TELLING ME?

36:16.842 --> 36:18.544
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

36:18.577 --> 36:20.412
NO, I CALLED YOU
THIS MORNING, BUT I
GOT YOUR VOICEMAIL.

36:20.446 --> 36:21.880
I WANTED TO SEE
HOW YOU WERE DOING

36:21.913 --> 36:23.649
AFTER LAST NIGHT'S
NEAR-MISS.

36:23.682 --> 36:25.984
OKAY, THOUGH I FEEL
LIKE I JUST POSTPONED
THE INEVITABLE.

36:26.017 --> 36:27.619
MAYBE NOT.

36:27.653 --> 36:30.356
I MEAN, WHAT I SAID
LAST NIGHT WAS THE TRUTH,

36:30.389 --> 36:33.492
EXCEPT FOR THE PART ABOUT
MY DAD KNOWING THE COACH
FROM STANFORD.

36:33.525 --> 36:35.461
BUT IT WAS GOOD ADVICE.

36:35.494 --> 36:36.862
AND SHE WAS
ONLINE THIS MORNING,

36:36.895 --> 36:39.698
CHECKING EVERY COLLEGE
WITH AN ENDOWMENT AND A POOL.

36:39.731 --> 36:41.600
SO IT WORKED.

36:41.633 --> 36:42.834
FOR NOW.

36:42.868 --> 36:44.403
SO, BE HAPPY.

36:44.436 --> 36:46.004
FOR NOW.

36:46.037 --> 36:47.739
WITH ME.

36:47.773 --> 36:49.708
'LEAST IT GIVES US TIME
FOR A SECOND DATE.

37:25.711 --> 37:27.413
( cell phone vibrates )

37:27.446 --> 37:28.747
WREN.

37:28.780 --> 37:31.417
MELISSA JUST CALLED.
SHE KNOWS WHERE IAN IS.

37:31.450 --> 37:33.919
I'M ON THE WAY.
 SPENCER--!

37:33.952 --> 37:35.787
( plinking sound )

37:43.629 --> 37:44.730
MOM?

37:44.763 --> 37:46.865
WE NEED TO TALK.

37:46.898 --> 37:48.734
CAN IT WAIT,
BECAUSE SPENCER--

37:48.767 --> 37:51.002
I DON'T THINK IT CAN.
I JUST GOT A CALL
FROM DR. SULLIVAN.

37:51.036 --> 37:53.772
HER OFFICE WAS
BROKEN INTO AFTER
YOUR LAST SESSION.

37:53.805 --> 37:55.907
IT WAS
COMPLETELY TRASHED.

37:55.941 --> 37:57.509
WHY WOULD SHE CALL YOU?

37:57.543 --> 37:59.778
HANNA, WHAT DID YOU
AND DR. SULLIVAN
TALK ABOUT?

37:59.811 --> 38:02.348
ISN'T THAT SUPPOSED TO BE
BETWEEN ME AND HER?

38:02.381 --> 38:03.882
I MEAN, THAT'S HOW
IT WORKS, RIGHT?

38:03.915 --> 38:06.652
WAS IT SOMETHING
THAT SOMEBODY...

38:06.685 --> 38:08.854
MIGHT NOT WANT
OTHER PEOPLE TO KNOW?

38:11.790 --> 38:13.392
WE CAN'T
DO THIS RIGHT NOW.

38:13.425 --> 38:15.594
YES, YOU CAN.
IF DR. SULLIVAN
CALLS THE POLICE,

38:15.627 --> 38:17.829
THEY'RE GONNA BE ASKING
A LOT MORE QUESTIONS
THAN I AM.

38:17.863 --> 38:19.698
WELL, THEN,
I'M GONNA NEED ANSWERS,

38:19.731 --> 38:21.567
AND I'M NOT
GETTING THEM HERE!

38:21.600 --> 38:22.668
HANNA!

38:30.842 --> 38:33.579
( indistinct police
radio chatter )

38:33.612 --> 38:35.581
EXCUSE ME, MA'AM.

38:35.614 --> 38:36.948
WHO ELSE HAD KEYS
TO THE OFFICE?

38:36.982 --> 38:39.351
NO ONE. WHY?

38:40.819 --> 38:42.521
THERE AREN'T ANY SIGNS
OF FORCED ENTRY.

38:48.594 --> 38:50.862
DO WE HAVE A PLAN?

38:50.896 --> 38:52.431
WORKING ON IT.

38:54.933 --> 38:57.135
SHOULD WE CALL GARRETT,
TELL HIM ABOUT IAN?

38:57.168 --> 38:58.837
Aria: NO.

38:58.870 --> 39:00.572
THE LAST THING WE NEED TO DO
IS GET HIM INVOLVED

39:00.606 --> 39:03.074
IN ANOTHER MYSTERY
WE CAN'T EXPLAIN.

39:03.108 --> 39:05.711
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN WE'RE THE GIRLS
WHO CRIED WOLF.

39:05.744 --> 39:07.413
I MEAN, DON'T YOU GET IT?

39:07.446 --> 39:08.847
WE'RE SCREWED.

39:10.749 --> 39:11.883
THEY'RE STOPPING.

39:35.841 --> 39:38.076
THERE'S NO TURNING
BACK NOW, RIGHT?

39:48.854 --> 39:52.591
Aria: I'VE GOT 9-1-1
ON SPEED-DIAL.

39:52.624 --> 39:53.892
Hanna: I'VE
ONLY GOT ONE BAR.

39:53.925 --> 39:56.928
OH, CRAP. NO BARS.

39:56.962 --> 39:58.864
Spencer: WE SHOULD
TAKE A PHOTO OF IAN,

39:58.897 --> 40:00.599
PROVE WE HAVEN'T BEEN
MAKING THIS ALL UP.

40:00.632 --> 40:02.000
YEAH, WELL, YOU
GO AHEAD AND DO THAT

40:02.033 --> 40:04.536
WHILE I TRY
NOT TO GET KILLED.

40:04.570 --> 40:08.006
SORRY. I'M JUST
WORRIED ABOUT MELISSA.

40:08.039 --> 40:10.442
WHO KNOWS
WHAT IAN'S THINKING?

40:10.476 --> 40:12.911
OR IF HE HAS A GUN.

40:12.944 --> 40:15.614
HE'S THE BAD GUY, RIGHT?

40:33.599 --> 40:36.935
( no audible dialogue )

40:49.881 --> 40:51.182
( Melissa screams )

40:51.216 --> 40:52.618
Spencer: MELISSA!

40:54.586 --> 40:57.656
( Melissa sobbing )

41:01.059 --> 41:02.594
( Spencer gasps )

41:13.171 --> 41:15.907
( hysterical sobbing )

41:44.269 --> 41:46.805
( indistinct conversation )
