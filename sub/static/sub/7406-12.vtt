YOUR ROBIN?

18:21.737 --> 18:24.838
SHOULD I TELL TRIGON
WHERE HE IS?

18:24.840 --> 18:27.873

OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU DON'T HAVE A MOMMY.

20:38.022 --> 20:41.890
DESPERATE, WEAK, VULNERABLE.

20:41.892 --> 20:46.160
- I'M HERE TO SAVE RAVEN,
NOT PITY YOU. WHICH WAY?

20:46.162 --> 20:49.296
- I'M AFRAID THIS IS WHERE
WE PART COMPANY.

20:49.298 --> 20:52.232
YOU'LL FIND YOUR FRIEND
ALONG THAT PATH.

20:52.234 --> 20:53.633

NO DOUBLE-CROSS?

20:59.907 --> 21:02.107
NO CRYPTIC THREAT?

21:02.109 --> 21:05.443
- I KEPT MY WORD.
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE GRATITUDE?

21:05.445 --> 21:07.445
- THIS DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING.

21:07.447 --> 21:09.246
IF I EVER SEE YOU AGAIN--

21:09.248 --> 21:12.449
