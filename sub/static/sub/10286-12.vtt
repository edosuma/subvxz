00:01.542 --> 00:03.339
- Any sign of Bull yet?
- Not yet.

00:03.511 --> 00:06.001
I'm getting worried.
He missed half of the session...

00:06.179 --> 00:10.138
...and there's still no word from him.
- No answer at his home either.

00:10.317 --> 00:12.649
Your Honor, what do you think
is going on with him?

00:12.818 --> 00:14.809
He's been late for work
four days in a row.

00:14.987 --> 00:17.285
He looks like he hasn't slept in a month.

00:17.590 --> 00:19.717
Maybe he's holding down a second job.

00:19.892 --> 00:22.519
Could be right. Could certainly
explain his behavior.

00:22.694 --> 00:25.629
But what kind of a job
could be taking so much out of him?

00:26.097 --> 00:29.225
Oh, ship's anchor, Little League
backstop, that sort of thing.

00:29.400 --> 00:31.367
- Dan.
- Maybe he just pulls people around...

00:31.535 --> 00:34.231
...in hansom cabs
when the horses get tired.

00:34.905 --> 00:38.601
I don't think that's very funny. I mean,
if the poor guy's got money problems...

00:38.774 --> 00:40.401
...he's probably very depressed.

00:40.676 --> 00:44.373
He doesn't have that same sparkle
in his eyes anymore.

00:44.547 --> 00:47.743
Yeah, and the zip's kind of gone
out of his lumbering.

00:48.717 --> 00:50.446
Maybe he's sick.

00:50.619 --> 00:54.110
He looks it. There he is.
Hey, Bull, over here!

00:54.288 --> 00:56.916

01:20.411 --> 01:23.380
Okay, so he's a little cranky.

01:24.215 --> 01:26.114
Somebody's gotta talk to him.

01:28.351 --> 01:29.477
I'll do it.

01:34.156 --> 01:36.124
Oh, just kidding.

01:36.325 --> 01:37.986
Just kidding.

02:24.801 --> 02:27.770
- Only one more case, Your Honor.
- Fine.

02:28.471 --> 02:29.732
Sir...

02:29.905 --> 02:33.363
...I realize I've only been here
one week, but...

02:33.775 --> 02:37.074
- How am I doing?
- Have you killed anyone yet?

02:37.245 --> 02:40.111
- No, sir.
- Then you're doing fine.

02:40.281 --> 02:43.114
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

02:43.918 --> 02:45.408
Bull.

02:46.987 --> 02:48.614
Bull.

02:52.359 --> 02:54.417
Behind you.

02:56.362 --> 02:59.695
- Bull, how are you feeling?
- I'm tired, Harry.

02:59.865 --> 03:01.264
Very tired.

03:01.433 --> 03:04.162
Bull, we are in court.
You might wanna call me judge.

03:04.435 --> 03:06.130
- What did I call you?
- "Harry."

03:09.674 --> 03:11.140
Bull.

03:11.375 --> 03:13.809
Bull, listen to me:

03:14.478 --> 03:17.276
We're all real concerned about you,
because, quite frankly...

03:17.447 --> 03:21.906
...you've been acting strange lately.
- More so than usual, Your Honor?

03:22.218 --> 03:25.517
You've been late all week,
you missed half of the session tonight...

03:25.688 --> 03:27.848
...and when you're here, you're not here.

03:28.023 --> 03:30.583
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

03:31.126 --> 03:33.889
Bull, just between us,
would a loan be in order?

03:34.461 --> 03:36.361
- How much do you need?
- No.

03:36.530 --> 03:37.997
I meant I would loan you money.

03:38.499 --> 03:41.696
I just wanna help you out of this problem
that's affecting your work.

03:41.868 --> 03:44.735
It won't affect my work anymore, sir.
I assure you.

03:44.904 --> 03:48.931
- Bull, as a friend, I'm concerned...
- I just assured you.

03:49.475 --> 03:53.171
You don't wanna talk about it? Fine.
You don't have to. Resume your duties.

03:53.779 --> 03:56.213
I'm going to go over there now...

03:57.416 --> 03:59.280
...and stand.

04:00.117 --> 04:02.711
Commence standing.

04:06.456 --> 04:08.481
Your Honor, did you find out anything?

04:08.658 --> 04:11.786
Yeah. What's the abominable Boy Scout
up to now?

04:12.362 --> 04:14.693
Can we get on with the case
and get out of here?

04:14.863 --> 04:17.161
Right away. Mr. Reynolds.

04:19.034 --> 04:23.299
Reynolds, Guy T. 629 Bleecker Street.

04:24.305 --> 04:25.829
May I remove my coat, Your Honor?

04:26.007 --> 04:27.804
- Sure.
- No!

04:28.743 --> 04:31.472
- Miss Williams?
- Your Honor, the charge.

04:32.112 --> 04:34.444
"Indecent exposure."

04:37.150 --> 04:40.482
You almost got me on that one,
didn't you, Mr. Reynolds?

04:40.653 --> 04:43.850
That charge is ridiculous, Your Honor.
I'm not a pervert.

04:44.023 --> 04:45.320
I'm a nudist.

04:46.357 --> 04:47.619
All right, that's enough.

04:48.927 --> 04:52.363
Mr. Reynolds, what you do in the privacy
of your own home is one thing...

04:52.530 --> 04:54.656
...but what you do
at the Chock Full o'Nuts...

04:54.832 --> 04:57.232
...at Fourth and Lexington
is quite another.

04:57.401 --> 05:01.064
That was the point, Your Honor.
To bring the subject out into the open.

05:01.238 --> 05:03.068
Discuss it, create a forum.

05:03.239 --> 05:07.005
Your Honor, what Mr. Reynolds
apparently created was a stampede...

05:07.176 --> 05:09.576
...when he stood atop
the coffee counter, disrobed...

05:09.746 --> 05:12.179
...and sang, "Hey, Look Me Over."

05:13.281 --> 05:16.512
Don't you see?
Our clothing inhibits us, people.

05:16.685 --> 05:19.414
Nudity allows us
to be open to each other.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.789
Great little icebreaker, no doubt.
But, Mr. Reynolds...

05:22.957 --> 05:25.425
...quite frankly, I don't wanna
know you that well.

05:25.593 --> 05:29.494
All I can say is, if you don't go nude,
you're missing a wonderful experience.

05:29.662 --> 05:31.254
It's... It's indescribable.

05:31.431 --> 05:33.990
Well, I'm gonna describe it
as a Class A misdemeanor...

05:34.166 --> 05:37.226
...and I'm gonna fine you $ 160.
And if there's any further...

05:37.402 --> 05:39.734
- Oh, mercy!
- Bull!

05:39.905 --> 05:42.634
- What happened?
- He fell asleep. Then he fell over.

05:42.807 --> 05:45.776
How could anybody fall asleep
standing on their feet like that?

05:45.943 --> 05:50.003
- Same principle as with livestock.
- Bull.

05:51.648 --> 05:53.206
Bull!

05:55.852 --> 05:59.753
- He's out like a light.
- You better check under him for survivors.

06:00.489 --> 06:03.424
- Let's get him into your office.
- We should cover him up.

06:03.592 --> 06:05.787
- Oh, here. Use my coat.
- No!

06:08.296 --> 06:12.255
Thanks for giving us a hand with Bull.
We really needed the help. Thank you.

06:12.700 --> 06:16.328
Thank you. Thanks a lot.
Thank you. Thank you very much.

06:16.503 --> 06:19.734
Thank you. You might wanna see
a doctor about that. Thank you.

06:19.907 --> 06:24.673
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Right. Thanks. Thanks.

06:24.844 --> 06:26.778
Thank you very much.

06:29.182 --> 06:32.207
- What...? Where?
- It's okay, Bull. You just fell asleep.

06:32.384 --> 06:35.319
You're in my office. We're all here:
Selma, Charlie, Liz...

06:35.487 --> 06:37.011
And Toto too.

06:39.123 --> 06:41.591
Remember what he did
to the candy machine?

06:41.759 --> 06:43.522
You guys need anything
while we're out?

06:43.694 --> 06:46.161
No? Okay, listen,
hey, take care, big guy.

06:49.365 --> 06:52.459
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

06:52.635 --> 06:54.568
Don't lie to me.

06:58.674 --> 07:01.370
Come on. Not in front of everybody.

07:01.877 --> 07:05.778
Bull, I know that your private life
is just that: It's private.

07:05.947 --> 07:08.609
But when you've got a problem
interfering with your job...

07:08.783 --> 07:11.012
...l'd like to know what's wrong.

07:11.251 --> 07:13.014
Answer him.

07:15.188 --> 07:18.156
Listen, everybody. I appreciate
your concern, I really do.

07:18.324 --> 07:22.693
But it's something I don't wanna talk
about now. Can't you understand that?

07:22.862 --> 07:26.024
Bull, it's true
I don't know you very well...

07:26.197 --> 07:28.597
...and... Well, maybe it's not my place...

07:28.766 --> 07:33.499
...but I find that when I have a problem,
sometimes it really lifts my spirits...

07:33.671 --> 07:35.968
...just to do something nice for myself...

07:36.139 --> 07:40.838
...like have a manicure,
buy a new dress...

07:41.178 --> 07:43.270
...have my hair done.

07:46.315 --> 07:48.215
I'll just get that.

07:49.218 --> 07:52.618
I hate to keep pressing the point,
but until I find out what's going on...

07:52.787 --> 07:55.813
...l'm afraid I might...
- Bull? It's for you.

07:58.158 --> 07:59.455
What?

08:00.928 --> 08:03.260
I'll be right there. I gotta go home.

08:03.430 --> 08:05.591
Bull, get back here
until I'm finished talking!

08:05.900 --> 08:09.130
Your Honor, I can't! My baby needs me!

08:10.370 --> 08:12.361
Baby? Did he say "baby"?

08:12.705 --> 08:17.471
If some girl got him in trouble,
she's gonna answer to me.

08:21.680 --> 08:24.375
I wonder which one is Bull's.

08:29.687 --> 08:31.711
No, let me guess.

08:34.691 --> 08:36.659
- Who is it?
- Harry.

08:37.159 --> 08:41.994
- Go away.
- Open up before I kick it in.

08:45.367 --> 08:48.130
Yes, ma'am. Come in.

08:52.807 --> 08:57.072
My, what a proportionate
place you have.

08:57.577 --> 08:59.169
I decorated it myself.

08:59.346 --> 09:00.836
Very...

09:01.415 --> 09:03.143
Beefy.

09:03.816 --> 09:05.807
Bull, what is this about a baby?

09:06.552 --> 09:08.952
Baby? Did I mention a baby?

09:13.091 --> 09:15.616
That darn cat.

09:16.261 --> 09:19.388
- Bull.
- He's right over here.

09:31.441 --> 09:32.806
His name's Ernie.

09:33.443 --> 09:35.501
Bull, where did that baby come from?

09:36.111 --> 09:38.170
You don't know
where babies come from?

09:39.715 --> 09:42.342
You know what I mean.
I mean, whose baby is it?

09:43.117 --> 09:44.846
- A friend's.
- Bull.

09:45.019 --> 09:47.749
A friend asked me to watch him
while she went on a job interview.

09:47.922 --> 09:50.481
- When was that?
- Friday.

09:50.657 --> 09:53.854
- That was five days ago.
- Yeah.

09:54.027 --> 09:57.588
- She abandoned this child, didn't she?
- She did not abandon the child.

09:57.764 --> 09:58.923
Bull, you listen to me...

10:00.632 --> 10:03.760
- Now look what you've done.
- Come on. I didn't do anything.

10:03.936 --> 10:06.597
He's hungry. I gotta go get some food
at the corner store.

10:06.771 --> 10:07.965
You guys watch him, okay?

10:08.139 --> 10:10.835
I don't know nothing about
watching no babies.

10:12.410 --> 10:16.539
The only thing domestic about me
is my perfume.

10:18.448 --> 10:20.473
I'll go to the store. What do you need?

10:20.650 --> 10:23.914
Just some baby food. Assorted
vegetables, fruits, that kind of thing.

10:24.086 --> 10:26.054
I'll be right back.

10:26.355 --> 10:29.586
I gotta go warm his formula.
Watch him, Your Honor.

10:33.762 --> 10:37.493
- Bull, he's crying.
- Perhaps he needs to be changed.

10:41.235 --> 10:43.533
Yeah. That's it, all right.

10:44.905 --> 10:47.372
- Then change him.
- Oh, you gotta be kidding.

10:47.540 --> 10:49.508
The stuff's there
on the table by the lamp.

10:49.675 --> 10:52.667
- No, Bull. I don't think I can.
- He's helpless, Your Honor.

10:52.845 --> 10:55.074
Guilt. Good move.

10:56.148 --> 10:57.547
Okay, what's first?

10:57.816 --> 11:02.445
- Take off the soiled diaper.
- Yeah, I saw that coming.

11:03.921 --> 11:08.324
Okay, Ernie. I'm just gonna
undo these pins...

11:08.959 --> 11:10.289
...and we'll...

11:10.527 --> 11:16.363
Oh, my God. I got it. I got it. I got it!

11:16.533 --> 11:18.966
Hamper, near the table!

11:22.004 --> 11:24.097
- You all right, judge?
- Yeah. What's next?

11:24.273 --> 11:26.263
See the Didie Wipes?

11:26.441 --> 11:29.103
- Yeah.
- Take one.

11:35.582 --> 11:37.015
What now?

11:37.217 --> 11:39.412
Clean the baby with it.

11:40.754 --> 11:45.622
Powder his bottom, affix the new diaper,
and you're done.

11:45.825 --> 11:47.656
Powder his bottom...

11:48.160 --> 11:51.356
...affix the new diaper, and I'm done.

11:51.529 --> 11:53.429
Okay.

11:55.300 --> 11:57.564
Clean the baby.

12:04.775 --> 12:07.675
Powder his bottom.

12:11.481 --> 12:14.006
Oh, there you are. Okay.

12:15.584 --> 12:18.075
Affix a new...

12:19.421 --> 12:21.355
...diaper.

12:22.656 --> 12:26.490
Okay, Ernie. I think we got it here. One.

12:28.562 --> 12:31.257
And two.

12:35.635 --> 12:37.227
How'd I do?

12:39.204 --> 12:42.196
You attached him to the mattress,
Your Honor.

12:43.876 --> 12:47.038
Boy, does this bring back memories.

12:47.211 --> 12:52.148
I haven't bought
strained peas since 1966.

12:52.316 --> 12:56.308
- Oh, yeah? Who was the little critter?
- Dad.

12:58.788 --> 13:02.382
Come on, little munchkin. Chow time.

13:02.558 --> 13:04.890
Bull, we've gotta talk about that child.

13:05.060 --> 13:07.494
- There's nothing to talk about.
- Bull...

13:07.963 --> 13:11.398
- Get that, would you, Your Honor?
- Yeah. Sure.

13:14.669 --> 13:19.264
- Hi, gang.
- I can't wait to see his bath towels.

13:21.642 --> 13:24.202
Guys, I'm afraid we have
a real problem in there.

13:24.378 --> 13:26.311
Charlie said something about a baby.

13:26.479 --> 13:30.438
Bull's neighbor left her baby with him
while she went off to a job interview.

13:30.616 --> 13:33.414
That was five days ago,
and she hasn't been back since.

13:33.719 --> 13:35.276
- She abandoned it.
- Right.

13:35.453 --> 13:38.786
But Mr. Mary Poppins in there
won't believe it.

13:40.258 --> 13:41.782
- Company.
- Hi.

13:41.960 --> 13:43.824
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

13:44.261 --> 13:46.695
My, my. This is very nice.

13:46.964 --> 13:50.660
Hey, would you look at this?
He's got cable.

13:52.535 --> 13:57.097
- Oh, look at the baby.
- How sweet. Is it a him or a her?

13:57.273 --> 13:58.899
Him. Ernie.

13:59.508 --> 14:02.705
- Bull, it's beautiful.
- Thank you.

14:03.645 --> 14:06.113
- Have a seat, everybody.
- Thanks.

14:07.315 --> 14:10.773
- What's the matter?
- Your sofa's a little hard.

14:10.952 --> 14:13.079
It's concrete.

14:14.188 --> 14:19.853
I made it myself. Durable, inexpensive,
easy to patch.

14:20.760 --> 14:23.353
He's got a 16-slice toaster out there.

14:23.529 --> 14:28.159
- Where?
- Over there, just left of the grain elevator.

14:28.567 --> 14:30.034
Dan, please.

14:30.202 --> 14:31.930
It's time we discussed the child.

14:32.103 --> 14:34.936
- Oh, Dan, isn't he beautiful?
- Yeah, dandy. What's out here?

14:35.506 --> 14:37.371
- The patio.
- Yeah? Great view.

14:37.542 --> 14:39.304
- These girders are the...
- Train tracks.

14:39.476 --> 14:42.138
Close to transportation. Good move.

14:42.312 --> 14:43.779
Close the door.

14:44.114 --> 14:46.946
Ernie's very susceptible to drafts.

14:47.250 --> 14:51.687
Bull, I'm afraid that Ernie is susceptible
to more than just drafts.

14:52.321 --> 14:56.916
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Bull, his mother isn't coming back.

14:57.092 --> 14:58.855
What's the matter with you people?

14:59.027 --> 15:02.723
How could anybody possibly abandon
a helpless little guy like this?

15:02.896 --> 15:04.989
Bull, you...

15:05.799 --> 15:08.131
You work in a courtroom.
You see this all the time.

15:08.302 --> 15:10.735
There are desperate,
emotionally stressed people...

15:10.903 --> 15:15.101
...capable of doing things they would
not do if they were healthy.

15:19.711 --> 15:21.178
That goes for me too.

15:22.781 --> 15:24.214
- What's that?
- What's what?

15:24.383 --> 15:26.112
- I hear it too.
- Is it thunder?

15:26.285 --> 15:28.912
That rumbling? That's just a train.

15:29.186 --> 15:32.383
- Dan?
- Did I mention the door sticks?

15:47.136 --> 15:49.764
Oh, Dan! Are you all right?!

15:50.738 --> 15:54.367
I think I swallowed my eyes.

15:54.742 --> 15:56.835
No. They're still there.

15:57.345 --> 16:00.074
- Bathroom.
- Down the hall.

16:01.415 --> 16:04.873
I'm fine. Thanks, Liz.

16:06.019 --> 16:07.986
Doesn't that train noise
affect the baby?

16:08.154 --> 16:09.280
No, he's used to it.

16:09.455 --> 16:12.219
- Mary's apartment's just down the hall.
- Is that his mother?

16:12.391 --> 16:15.257
- Yep.
- Bull, Mary is not coming back.

16:16.161 --> 16:19.153
Your Honor, I know this woman.

16:19.331 --> 16:20.730
And I know she's coming back.

16:20.899 --> 16:25.028
All right. Suppose for a moment
that she isn't. Then what?

16:26.203 --> 16:28.262
Then I...

16:28.472 --> 16:32.703
Then you'll what? You're gonna
go on with this for 18 years?

16:37.280 --> 16:38.576
What do you want me to do?

16:39.114 --> 16:44.017
I'll make out a court order,
and we'll contact the proper authorities.

16:44.886 --> 16:46.409
If he's going on a trip...

16:46.587 --> 16:48.817
...I better get Mr. Boogee.

16:48.989 --> 16:51.514
- Who?
- His teddy bear.

16:51.692 --> 16:54.126
He won't leave home without it.

16:55.929 --> 16:58.329
- Where is it?
- Mary's place.

16:58.498 --> 17:02.332
- I got a key to her apartment here.
- Give it to me. I'll go.

17:02.501 --> 17:05.560
Around the corner, number two.
Mr. Boogee's in the playpen.

17:05.738 --> 17:07.501
I'll be right back.

17:07.673 --> 17:10.435
I'm going in the kitchen
to have a cigarette.

17:10.608 --> 17:15.636
Let the kid learn his bad habits
in school, like everybody else.

17:17.013 --> 17:19.948
- Dan, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

17:20.117 --> 17:21.414
You have gotta see that tub.

17:21.585 --> 17:24.383
Bull, the life preserver,
that's for guests, right?

17:27.823 --> 17:29.313
Oh, no.

17:48.242 --> 17:51.677
If this were a banana, I'd be dead.

17:58.517 --> 18:00.451
What are you doing?

18:01.019 --> 18:02.748
What are you doing by that door?

18:02.921 --> 18:07.789
Nothing. L... I'm just looking for a friend.
I'm just...

18:09.160 --> 18:10.752
Mr. Boogee.

18:12.163 --> 18:13.391
Hi, Mary.

18:22.938 --> 18:26.567
Actually, I prefer cloth diapers
to the other products if I have the time.

18:27.342 --> 18:30.072
Although other mothers
may tell you different.

18:32.046 --> 18:35.277
Bull, I ran into a friend of yours.

18:38.752 --> 18:40.413
Mary.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.084
Hi, Bull.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.455
How is?

18:48.194 --> 18:52.995
- How is?
- Look who's here.

18:59.604 --> 19:02.834
He was right. She came back.

19:03.006 --> 19:04.268
He believed in her.

19:04.441 --> 19:07.433
Till a year ago, he believed
in the Easter Bunny.

19:09.379 --> 19:13.542
- I guess I should start with thank you.
- No problem.

19:13.716 --> 19:18.415
Although I was starting to get a little
worried. Well, not real worried, but...

19:18.587 --> 19:20.612
I was wondering if something
happened to you.

19:20.789 --> 19:25.249
No, nothing happened. I just
got a little lost for a while.

19:25.427 --> 19:28.361
Where do you get lost for six days?

19:29.230 --> 19:30.754
In here.

19:30.931 --> 19:34.094
I really did go for that job interview
like I said.

19:34.268 --> 19:38.397
But then after that... I don't know.
I just kept going.

19:38.571 --> 19:41.233
Running, I guess. I mean...

19:41.407 --> 19:46.343
Sometimes it's tough enough just trying
to take care of yourself, much less...

19:46.512 --> 19:48.241
Well, you know.

19:48.413 --> 19:52.473
- Being a mother is not an easy job.
- Tell me about it.

19:53.551 --> 19:55.917
But I started to realize,
"What am I doing?"

19:56.087 --> 19:57.850
And then I got ashamed...

19:58.022 --> 20:02.082
...because I'd left him. And that made
it even harder to come back.

20:02.259 --> 20:07.525
But I wanted to be with him.
L... I wanted to say to him:

20:07.696 --> 20:09.630
"I'm sorry, Ernie."

20:10.132 --> 20:12.532
I wanted to hug him and just say:

20:12.902 --> 20:15.301
"I love you very, very much."

20:16.137 --> 20:17.900
I told him for you.

20:18.773 --> 20:22.106
But what happens if he grows up
and finds out that l...?

20:22.310 --> 20:25.278
That you got delayed? So what?

20:25.445 --> 20:26.935
We all get delayed sometime.

20:27.681 --> 20:30.411
- Don't we, Your Honor?
- All the time.

20:30.716 --> 20:33.014
- You're a judge?
- Yeah, I am.

20:33.719 --> 20:35.653
Am I going to be arrested?

20:36.022 --> 20:38.683
It's not actually abandonment,
since you did leave him...

20:38.857 --> 20:40.324
...in someone's custody, but...

20:40.492 --> 20:43.461
- She'll stay with him, Your Honor.
- I will. Believe me, I will.

20:43.628 --> 20:45.391
I know she will.

20:46.197 --> 20:48.027
Just like I knew she'd come back.

20:48.699 --> 20:50.530
Yeah, you did.

20:53.637 --> 20:55.501
Can I go now?

20:55.972 --> 20:57.997
I don't see why not.

20:58.608 --> 21:00.473
Thank you, Bull.

21:02.579 --> 21:05.945
I wish Ernie had
had a father just like you.

21:10.685 --> 21:12.050
Mary?

21:15.289 --> 21:18.689
If you ever start to get lost again...

21:18.858 --> 21:20.223
...give me a call.

21:20.727 --> 21:23.594
I know a couple of shortcuts out of here.

21:24.664 --> 21:26.632
I will.

21:27.266 --> 21:29.029
So long, squirt.

21:29.568 --> 21:31.058
Bull.

21:36.407 --> 21:38.398
Did he say?

21:38.576 --> 21:41.602
His first word, yeah.

21:43.981 --> 21:47.007
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

21:49.252 --> 21:52.880
Come on, everybody. Let's go
and let this boy get some sleep.

21:53.055 --> 21:55.080
- Good night, Bull.
- Come on, gang.

21:55.992 --> 21:57.857
Good night, Bull.

21:58.160 --> 22:00.286
Take it easy, Bull.

22:00.795 --> 22:04.128
- Hey, wait a minute.
- Your head! Watch out! You...

22:05.033 --> 22:06.466
Listen.

22:06.635 --> 22:09.398
I just want to thank you all
for being concerned about me.

22:09.603 --> 22:11.833
- I really appreciate it.
- Hey.

22:12.406 --> 22:15.340
- Good night.
- Good night.

22:17.810 --> 22:19.573
That is pretty clever.

22:19.746 --> 22:23.579
Let's go get some coffee.
I got to tell you about his toilet seat.
