-* Bad boys, bad boys,

00:23.567 --> 00:25.967
-I smoked some marijuana!
I'm a marijuana smoker!

00:26.000 --> 00:27.833
-* Bad boys, bad boys *
-Crawl out!

00:27.867 --> 00:29.233

-Hands up! Hands up!

00:30.500 --> 00:32.367
Hold it! Hold it!
Hold it! Hold it!

00:32.400 --> 00:34.433
-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.467 --> 00:36.533
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.567 --> 00:39.100
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:39.133 --> 00:41.267
in a court of law.

00:43.033 --> 00:44.767
-Officer Lindsey:
Before I became
a police officer,

00:44.800 --> 00:46.267
I was an advertising manager.

00:46.300 --> 00:48.800
I worked for several different
newspapers in the valley

00:48.833 --> 00:53.000
for about 15 or 16 years,
and I decided that
the corporate world

00:53.033 --> 00:55.067
and, uh, chasin'
the almighty dollar

00:55.100 --> 00:56.500
wasn't really worth it.

00:56.533 --> 00:58.933
Police work was always something
that interested me,

00:58.967 --> 01:00.333
and I've got some family
in there,

01:00.367 --> 01:03.500
so after goin' on a couple
of ride-alongs, uh, I thought,

01:03.533 --> 01:05.467
"You know what? This is
the career for me."

01:05.500 --> 01:07.367
I'm lovin' every minute of it.

01:08.700 --> 01:11.733
-I got a guy up here on
the right just got on the bike.

01:11.767 --> 01:15.867
He's a known--
he has an outstanding
Glendale warrant.

01:17.067 --> 01:19.200
He's an old-- uhp, yep.
It's gotta be him,

01:19.233 --> 01:20.900
'cause there he is,
he's runnin'.

01:23.267 --> 01:24.900
Well, walkin' fast.

01:29.900 --> 01:31.167
Jerry!
Come here!

01:31.200 --> 01:32.300
Come here!

01:34.667 --> 01:37.067
Did he go
in the house? Looked like--
-Yeah, he went in the house.

01:39.067 --> 01:41.900
-Pittman: It's just a 52,
so it ain't worth chasin' him...

01:41.933 --> 01:43.200
if he's in the house.

01:44.767 --> 01:47.633
-Problem with Jerry is,
he's the type of guy
who will bunker down

01:47.667 --> 01:51.700
for about an hour.
But we'll, uh--

01:53.567 --> 01:55.067
we'll drive away and see--

01:55.067 --> 01:57.933
I don't know if he'll
come out or not.

01:57.967 --> 02:00.900
-(radio chatter)
-I was tryin' to see
if he jumped the fence,

02:00.933 --> 02:02.900
but he probably
just ran inside.

02:04.100 --> 02:05.967
Either he knows he has
a warrant or he had--

02:06.067 --> 02:08.200
-Lindsey:
He's got dope on him I bet.
-Pittman: Dope on him, yeah.

02:10.167 --> 02:11.233
Perp, walkin'.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.500
There he is.

02:25.433 --> 02:27.200
Back yard!
Back yard!

02:30.133 --> 02:31.367
-Lindsey:
Jerry! Where you at?

02:32.500 --> 02:35.167
-(dog barking)
-Pittman: Nora 27.

02:35.200 --> 02:36.967
What is this,
5-5-5-9 drive?

02:37.067 --> 02:38.400
-Lindsey:
550, 5-9 drive in--

02:40.867 --> 02:43.767
-Pittman:
Yeah, we just had, uh,
Jerry run from us,

02:43.800 --> 02:47.800
into the back yard
at 2-5-5-9 Drive.

02:47.833 --> 02:49.333
He does have a warrant.

02:51.267 --> 02:53.133
-Lindsey:
Jeff, he's out here,
foot pursuit!

03:00.600 --> 03:03.467
-(grunting)

03:03.500 --> 03:05.067
-Stay down!
-All right, I'm down!

03:05.100 --> 03:06.867
-Stay down!
-Aaah!

03:06.900 --> 03:08.333
Ow!
-Stay down!

03:08.367 --> 03:09.967
-Ow! Can't breathe!

03:10.067 --> 03:11.200
-Stay...
-Can't breathe!

03:11.233 --> 03:12.367
-...down!

03:12.400 --> 03:13.433
-Can't breathe!

03:13.467 --> 03:15.267
Uhh...

03:15.300 --> 03:16.467
Can't breathe!

03:16.500 --> 03:18.833
Oh. Aah.

03:18.867 --> 03:20.333
I've got MRSA...

03:20.367 --> 03:23.067
on my legs.
-That's an old excuse, buddy.

03:23.067 --> 03:24.667
-Look at my legs.

03:24.700 --> 03:26.100
Look at my shins.

03:26.133 --> 03:27.867
-Taking one into custody.
Go for it.

03:27.900 --> 03:31.167
-You gotta-- you guys
gotta put on gloves.

03:31.200 --> 03:32.500
You guys have
to put on gloves.

03:32.533 --> 03:35.633
-Okay.
-(breathing heavily)
Put on gloves, please.

03:35.667 --> 03:36.767
-Why are you runnin'
from us?

03:36.800 --> 03:38.833
-(retching)

03:38.867 --> 03:41.067
-Okay, I gotta know
where there's more needles at.

03:41.100 --> 03:42.867
Stop. Relax.
-(retching)

03:42.900 --> 03:46.533
-Turn over.
Turn up, come on.

03:46.567 --> 03:49.433
He's got needles on him.
-Yeah, we'll be very cautious.

03:49.467 --> 03:52.067
-I have MRSA.
-I know you do, Jerry.

03:52.067 --> 03:54.067
Lean back.
-I don't have nothin' else, sir.

03:54.067 --> 03:57.133
-Lean back, and lay down.
-Aaah-- I have insulin,
too, aah.

03:57.167 --> 03:58.800
-Lay down.
-Lay down, lay down.

03:58.833 --> 04:00.167
-I have insulin too, sir.

04:00.200 --> 04:02.700
(moaning)
-Some of it.

04:02.733 --> 04:05.933
-(moaning)

04:05.967 --> 04:10.767
-Uh, got some marijuana
on him, some needles.
He's a heroin user.

04:10.800 --> 04:14.533
-He has a couple open cases.
One is for dangerous drugs,
and another one

04:14.567 --> 04:18.767
is for... um...
an armed robbery.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.867
And, uh, he's complaining
he's got MRSA on his legs,

04:21.900 --> 04:26.433
which is a-- a virus
that the skin deteriorates

04:26.467 --> 04:29.900
and it's very painful,
but it's also very contagious.

04:29.933 --> 04:34.200
The city jails don't like
to deal with it, 'cause it can
spread from inmate to inmate,

04:34.233 --> 04:36.800
and he is trying to use it
for his advantage

04:36.833 --> 04:38.067
so he doesn't go to jail today.

04:38.100 --> 04:42.067
But we'll make it to where
he is gonna go to jail,

04:42.067 --> 04:45.267
and we'll take care
of all those other issues.

04:45.300 --> 04:48.200
-He went into
the back yard.
We went followin' him.

04:48.233 --> 04:50.100
What he did is come back
around this other side.

04:50.133 --> 04:52.100
So I came back out
the front.

04:52.133 --> 04:53.967
He got tripped up
tryin' to jump over the fence,

04:54.067 --> 04:56.233
and he and kind of...
-Wow...

04:56.267 --> 04:59.300
-Foot pursuit, as I was
catchin' him, kinda
put his hands up,

04:59.333 --> 05:01.067
and I just went, oomph!

05:01.067 --> 05:04.733
-That's all over my legs.
Just look at my legs.
-Stop moving.

05:04.767 --> 05:06.333
-You're tougher
than that, Jerry.

05:06.367 --> 05:08.700
I see you out here
act like that.

05:08.733 --> 05:11.633
-(indistinct voices)

05:11.667 --> 05:14.367
-Well, listen, we're gonna
get you to the hospital
and have your wounds

05:14.400 --> 05:16.700
take a look at, okay?
-Thank you.

05:16.733 --> 05:19.967
-So then, in your pocket,
I found a couple of needles
and a small baggie

05:20.067 --> 05:21.733
of marijuana.
-Okay.

05:21.767 --> 05:25.233
-Okay, are you
still usin' needles?
-No.

05:25.267 --> 05:26.867
-No? Why do you have
needles on for?

05:26.900 --> 05:28.700
-Insulin.
-Insulin? Okay.

05:28.733 --> 05:34.067
What's the marijuana for?
-Um... actually, I found that
on the ground.

05:34.100 --> 05:36.167
-You found that on the ground?
-Yes.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.867
-Okay. Do you have
a medical marijuana card?

05:37.900 --> 05:40.533
-Uh, it's in process.
-It's in process?

05:40.567 --> 05:44.067
-But I don't even smoke weed.
-Okay. Well, you're gonna
get charged

05:44.100 --> 05:47.267
with the marijuana
that was in your pocket,
and a couple of needles.

05:47.300 --> 05:49.067
It was in your possession, okay?

05:49.067 --> 05:53.267
-Why am I gettin' charged
for... needles, I mean, like--

05:53.300 --> 05:55.200
-'Cause it's a paraphernalia.

05:55.233 --> 05:57.667
-You know--
-You don't have your insulin
on you.

05:57.700 --> 06:01.333
-It was-- uh...
look, look, look.

06:01.367 --> 06:02.967
Is that the misdemeanor,
though, right?

06:03.067 --> 06:06.600
-Well, the possession
of the marijuana is
a class 6 felony.

06:07.900 --> 06:09.667
-What?
-Yep.

06:09.700 --> 06:13.367
-Why is it class 6?
I thought it was a misdemeanor
under a certain amount.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.100
-Nope.
No, any kind of possession
of marijuana

06:15.133 --> 06:18.967
without a medical marijuana card
is a class 6 felony
here in Arizona.

06:20.100 --> 06:21.400
Okay?
-I don't smoke weed.

06:21.433 --> 06:23.067
-But let's get you
some medical attention first,

06:23.067 --> 06:25.167
and then we'll talk
about everything else.

06:27.667 --> 06:30.167
-So, we had, uh,
Glendale Fire come out.
They're gonna evaluate

06:30.200 --> 06:33.800
his condition and just
get him ready to transport
him down to a local hospital,

06:33.833 --> 06:38.133
where they can medically treat
for his injuries on his legs.

06:38.167 --> 06:42.433
Um, and then, while he's there,
we'll have an officer
sit with him,

06:42.467 --> 06:45.300
and then once he gets cleared
from the hospital, we'll
bring him back

06:45.333 --> 06:46.933
to the-- so the detectives
can interview him,

06:46.967 --> 06:50.600
and hopefully close out
at least three open cases.

06:50.633 --> 06:53.433
-Jerry?
You're gonna go down
for the outstanding warrant

06:53.467 --> 06:56.367
for the shoplifting
that you did, possession
of the marijuana,

06:56.400 --> 06:59.167
and the paraphernalia, okay?

06:59.200 --> 07:01.433
Get yourself better.
-Thank you.

07:01.467 --> 07:04.733
-Glad you're okay?
-Yeah. He broke my fall.

07:04.767 --> 07:05.767
-(laughs)

07:08.500 --> 07:11.100
-Sanders: I've always
been the kind of person
that's wanted to help people.

07:11.133 --> 07:14.100
And, you know, I-- I worked
in the jails for a while,

07:14.133 --> 07:17.400
and you know, I just thought,
"What better way
to help somebody

07:17.433 --> 07:19.500
than to-- to become
a police officer?"

07:19.533 --> 07:23.633
They do it in so many ways
that it just seemed like
the right fit,

07:23.667 --> 07:24.767
right thing to do.

07:26.900 --> 07:29.900
We have a subject
that's bailed from a car
that an outside agency

07:29.933 --> 07:32.900
was chasin'.
The chase was canceled.

07:32.933 --> 07:37.233
Uh, officer located him
in the area, and took off
on foot after him.

07:37.267 --> 07:40.500
Uh, guy ran behind a house,
the officer lost sight of him.

07:40.533 --> 07:43.467
Uh, Sergeant's now callin'
for a perimeter to be set up.

07:43.500 --> 07:47.867
Uh, we don't know
if we have a-- any charges
yet or not.

07:47.900 --> 07:51.067
So potentially we will have
a K-9 en route.

07:51.067 --> 07:56.067
So we're gonna go see
if we can't set up a--
set up a perimeter

07:56.067 --> 07:58.167
and see if we can't
get this guy boxed in.

07:58.200 --> 08:01.067
-Man on radio:
Okay, he just ran east,

08:01.067 --> 08:03.633
he's gonna be over
by 24th and Estelle.

08:03.667 --> 08:07.333
He ran between Prince
and Estelle.

08:07.367 --> 08:10.133
-So it looks like
we're gonna start
from the east,

08:10.167 --> 08:13.200
over here where the, uh,
car was located.

08:13.233 --> 08:16.467
Then we're gonna
walk it out to the west.

08:16.500 --> 08:20.133
So we're gonna have
a handful of officers
on foot.

08:20.167 --> 08:23.233
And I think, uh, we
have a pretty tight net
on him right now,

08:23.267 --> 08:26.200
he's probably layin'
down in somebody's
back yard right now.

08:30.667 --> 08:33.100
-(radio chatter)

08:43.300 --> 08:45.333
-(dogs barking)

08:45.367 --> 08:47.433
-(radio chatter)

08:54.067 --> 08:55.700
-Back of that's clear.

08:55.733 --> 08:58.233
-Everybody keeps sayin'
he was runnin' back, east.

08:58.267 --> 09:02.067
We were all right there.
Me, Jansen, Sarge,

09:02.067 --> 09:05.200
were on Estelle right as he said
he was runnin', west.

09:05.233 --> 09:07.967
-What about that house
right to the north of the one
that we were in, the back yard,

09:08.067 --> 09:09.967
initially?
Like where you saw him?

09:10.067 --> 09:12.067
You gonna go work
that side of the street
and go north?

09:12.067 --> 09:14.067
-Yeah, we could try that.

09:14.067 --> 09:19.233
-(dog barking)
-Hey, hey, hey, hey!
He's right here!

09:19.267 --> 09:21.733
-Show me your hands!
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!

09:21.767 --> 09:23.900
Lay down on the ground!
-I'm tryin'. Hey, this is
my mom's phone--

09:23.933 --> 09:26.067
-I don't care.
Lay down on the ground.

09:26.067 --> 09:29.800
Forty-one, I got him,
one to the north
of 2525 Estelle.

09:29.833 --> 09:32.167
He's on the ground.
-It's my mom's. Please,
thank you, sir.

09:32.200 --> 09:34.633
-Show me your other hand.
-Why are you-- I don't--
I don't have nothin'.

09:36.633 --> 09:39.100
I'm not-- I'm not--
Dude, I'm not...

09:40.533 --> 09:42.200
Will you please make sure
she gets that phone, sir?

09:42.233 --> 09:44.567
-Forty-one, one in custody.

09:44.600 --> 09:46.300
-Sir, can you make sure
she gets that phone, please?

09:46.333 --> 09:49.300
Don't-- Please don't--
-I will make sure
that she gets it.

09:49.333 --> 09:51.333
What's you name, bud?
-Mine?

09:51.367 --> 09:54.233
-Yeah.
-I ain't gonna lie.
I'm sorry.

09:54.267 --> 09:56.067
-Okay.
-Don't-- don't lie, I just
asked you your name.

09:56.067 --> 09:57.600
-Could you make sure
she gets that phone?

09:57.633 --> 09:59.700
-Well, who am I givin'
the phone to if I don't know
who you are?

09:59.733 --> 10:02.800
Up on your knees
and then up on your--
there you go.

10:02.833 --> 10:03.933
-I'm sorry.
-What's your name?

10:03.967 --> 10:05.367
-Let's go this way.

10:05.400 --> 10:06.467
All right.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.533
-Uh, I just took off with it.

10:08.567 --> 10:11.633
-Let's, uh, see if we got
anything ditched under this car.

10:11.667 --> 10:14.500
He was right here.
He was workin' his way
around it

10:14.533 --> 10:16.467
as I was goin' that way, so...

10:16.500 --> 10:18.767
-Workin' around the car?
-Yeah, he was workin' his way
around the car,

10:18.800 --> 10:20.800
tryin' to be cover.

10:20.833 --> 10:23.567
-Is there any way
I could sit down?
-Absolutely, man,

10:23.600 --> 10:25.600
I was gettin' ready to stick
you in a car right here, okay?

10:25.633 --> 10:26.900
-What's your name, bud?
-Taylor.

10:26.933 --> 10:28.767
-Taylor?
Those cuffs on good?

10:28.800 --> 10:31.500
Not cuttin' off circulation?
All right, hop up there
for me, all right?

10:31.533 --> 10:34.833
-(tearful)
I have a baby on the--
on the way,

10:34.867 --> 10:36.367
and she's my girlfriend,
six months pregnant,

10:36.400 --> 10:38.600
and I'm not gonna see her
for a while. I just wanna
talk to my mom.

10:38.633 --> 10:41.033
-Okay, Taylor, it sounds like
you made some pretty bad
decisions tonight.

10:41.067 --> 10:43.333
You got warrants, man?
What's goin' on?
Why are we runnin'?

10:43.367 --> 10:45.467
-(crying) Yeah.
I had a probation violation,

10:45.500 --> 10:48.233
I just got scared.
I didn't want to--

10:48.267 --> 10:50.767
-Okay.
-I didn't even know
(indistinct).

10:50.800 --> 10:53.767
And then I just ran
when I seen cops,
and then I--

10:53.800 --> 10:55.633
-Did you see officers
whenever they were lookin'
for you?

10:55.667 --> 10:58.500
-No, not--
-And it didn't occur to you
that, man, you're just

10:58.533 --> 11:01.133
makin' matters worse?
-No, not really, that's why
I didn't-- no, that's why

11:01.167 --> 11:02.733
I just stayed there.
I didn't-- I was so scared,

11:02.767 --> 11:04.533
I didn't just wanna run--
you know what I'm saying?

11:04.567 --> 11:06.900
'Cause I didn't want nothin'
to happen to me, so I just
stayed right there,

11:06.933 --> 11:09.167
I, literally--
I knew I was caught...
-Well, I'll tell you what, man,

11:09.200 --> 11:10.900
whenever the police
are after you, if you just stop,

11:10.933 --> 11:12.133
nothing's gonna happen
to you, right?

11:12.167 --> 11:13.400
-Yeah, I know...
-You understand that?

11:13.433 --> 11:15.300
You run it only
makes things worse
for you, right?

11:15.333 --> 11:17.433
Okay, well, let's hope
you learned a lesson
on that.

11:17.467 --> 11:19.567
I gotta go talk to my Sarge,
I'll be right back
with you, okay?

11:19.600 --> 11:21.500
-Could somebody get hold
of my mom, please?
-I will work on

11:21.533 --> 11:23.067
gettin' your mom,
all right, Taylor?
-Hey--

11:25.233 --> 11:27.967
He wants to make a phone call
to his mom, so I was gonna
let him do that real quick.

11:28.067 --> 11:29.600
-She might be in the car.
I'm not sure.

11:29.633 --> 11:31.233
-Yeah, she was
in a white Toyota, yeah.

11:31.267 --> 11:34.600
-Yeah.
So we'll-- we'll, uh,
we'll clear all this,

11:34.633 --> 11:36.600
and then we'll take him
back over to that car stop.

11:36.633 --> 11:37.933
-All right.
Sounds good, Sarge.

11:39.667 --> 11:41.367
-Hey, Taylor.
-Yeah?

11:41.400 --> 11:42.867
-Uh, they released the vehicle
to your mom.

11:42.900 --> 11:44.367
I don't know
if they talked to you about that

11:44.400 --> 11:47.133
or not, uh...
-Can you let me make
a phone call to my baby mama?

11:47.167 --> 11:50.067
-If you wanna call--
What's her name?

11:50.067 --> 11:52.333
If you wanna call,
that's fine, man,
I can do that.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.167
-Woman on phone: Hello?
-Hey, babe.

11:56.200 --> 11:59.133
-Woman: Hey.
-Hey, uh, I just wanna
let you know I'm goin' to jail.

11:59.167 --> 12:00.867
(sniffs)
-Woman: All right.

12:00.900 --> 12:05.100
-(crying)
Um, will you put
visits on and stuff?

12:05.133 --> 12:08.633
-Woman: What?
-Will you put visits
on-- on the phone?

12:08.667 --> 12:10.767
-Woman: Yeah.
-And tell my mom
that I love her

12:10.800 --> 12:13.300
and I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to do it,
and I'm sorry, baby.

12:13.333 --> 12:16.333
Please just stay
with me, though.
-Woman: Okay.

12:16.367 --> 12:18.367
-I love you.
-Woman: Love you, too.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.900
-Tell my mom I'll call her
when I get to the jail, okay?

12:20.933 --> 12:23.067
-Woman: All right.
-Oh, and tell her she can
come, uh, get her--

12:23.100 --> 12:25.767
I think she can come to pro--
ask-- I guess, uh,
in, uh, property

12:25.800 --> 12:28.300
for her phone
and 60 bucks
that I have on me,

12:28.333 --> 12:30.200
and give it to her, too?

12:30.233 --> 12:32.933
-Woman: Okay.
-All right, babe, keep--
keep Raylynn safe

12:32.967 --> 12:34.400
for me, okay?

12:34.433 --> 12:37.200
-Woman: I will.
-I-- I love you guys.

12:37.233 --> 12:38.733
-Love you too.
-All right, love you, bye.

12:38.767 --> 12:40.667
-Woman: Bye.
-Thank you, sir.

12:40.700 --> 12:42.067
-You're welcome, man.

12:43.900 --> 12:46.767
Hey, Taylor, you're
goin' to jail tonight, okay?
-I know.

12:46.800 --> 12:50.167
-You're goin' to jail
for felony evade
and elude, okay?

12:50.200 --> 12:52.200
Bud, you got a little kid
on the way, man.
-I know.

12:52.233 --> 12:54.200
-What are you doin'
stuff like this for?

12:54.233 --> 12:56.567
-Like I said, I've never
done anything like that before,

12:56.600 --> 12:58.167
I just got scared.

12:58.200 --> 13:01.067
-Whenever you become a father,
bud, that changes the game, bud.

13:01.100 --> 13:02.700
You need to start
makin' better decisions.

13:02.733 --> 13:05.133
You get out, you wanna
make a life for that kid, right?

13:05.167 --> 13:07.667
Right? Okay?
-Yes, sir.

13:07.700 --> 13:09.967
-He doesn't need to be
comin' and visitin' Daddy,
puttin' his hand up

13:10.067 --> 13:11.533
against a piece of glass, right?

13:11.567 --> 13:14.400
-Yeah. Yeah.
-You don't wanna live
raisin' your kid behind bars,

13:14.433 --> 13:15.533
right?
-No.

13:15.567 --> 13:17.667
-All right, man.
-Thank you.

13:17.700 --> 13:19.467
-So get this stuff
worked out, all right?

13:23.267 --> 13:24.733
-Lindsey:
Currently right now I am

13:24.767 --> 13:27.167
in the middle of training
for a Half Iron Man

13:27.200 --> 13:31.500
in October, so during
my off time I'm either
in the pool swimmin',

13:31.533 --> 13:34.100
ridin' out on the streets
or runnin'.

13:34.133 --> 13:38.733
Um, I'm doin' it strictly
because, just tryin' to prove
to myself that at my age,

13:38.767 --> 13:42.267
I still can do it,
and compete in it,

13:42.300 --> 13:45.300
and finish without
embarrassing myself.

13:45.333 --> 13:48.933
-We're gonna go out
with a suspicious subject
sitting at a bus stop

13:48.967 --> 13:51.567
tryin' to flag random people
down and get a ride.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.867
We believe he might have
a felony warrant out

13:53.900 --> 13:55.067
for his arrest.

13:55.067 --> 13:57.933
He's the one in the hat, right?
-Yeah.

13:57.967 --> 13:59.567
-Hey, don't I know you
from somewhere?

13:59.600 --> 14:02.433
-Who?
-You. What's your name?

14:02.467 --> 14:03.533
-Huh?
-What's your name?

14:03.567 --> 14:05.467
-Jesus.
-Jesus what?

14:05.500 --> 14:07.333
-Huh?
-You got an ID on you?

14:07.367 --> 14:08.900
You look really familiar.
-Really?

14:08.933 --> 14:10.367
-Yeah.

14:10.400 --> 14:11.467
-Jesus?
-Yeah?

14:11.500 --> 14:13.367
-Where you from?
-I'm from Tulsa.

14:13.400 --> 14:15.067
-From Tulsa?
-Yes, sir.

14:15.067 --> 14:16.733
-Have a seat for me
right here.

14:18.067 --> 14:20.967
You don't have any ID
on you at all?
-No, sir.

14:21.067 --> 14:23.200
-You been arrested before?
-Yeah.

14:23.233 --> 14:27.667
-For what?
-For, uh-- what was it called?

14:27.700 --> 14:29.100
I've been arrested, but like,

14:29.133 --> 14:31.300
they didn't take me,
like, they just came--

14:31.333 --> 14:32.900
-That doesn't make any sense.
-Huh?

14:32.933 --> 14:35.100
-That doesn't make any sense.
-Like, well I haven't
been arrested,

14:35.133 --> 14:38.200
they just stopped me
'cause, they-- me and my sister
were arguing outside the house,

14:38.233 --> 14:41.767
then the neighbors
called the cops, and they just
made a report,

14:41.800 --> 14:44.567
and they let me go.
-So it's really not
bein' arrested at all.

14:44.600 --> 14:47.067
-Yeah. True.
-How old are you?

14:47.100 --> 14:49.400
-22.

14:49.433 --> 14:54.367
-What's your home address?
-My home address?
Um, I'm homeless.

14:54.400 --> 14:56.633
-What's the address
that you last lived at?

14:56.667 --> 14:59.067
-Uh...
-Like what would be
on your ID?

14:59.067 --> 15:01.867
-My ID? Um--
-Are you havin' a hard time

15:01.900 --> 15:03.300
understandin' me?

15:03.333 --> 15:06.067
-Yeah. Kinda.
-What address
would be on your ID?

15:06.100 --> 15:07.433
-I don't--
I have three addresses.

15:07.467 --> 15:10.733
-Okay.
-I have my sister's address,
and-- well, I have

15:10.767 --> 15:12.633
all three
of my sister's addresses.
-Okay.

15:12.667 --> 15:13.900
-'Cause I have three
older sisters.

15:13.933 --> 15:15.767
-Go ahead, give me 'em.
-I have--

15:15.800 --> 15:19.200
I can't remember 'em
by heart, to be real.

15:19.233 --> 15:22.133
-I'm gettin' the impression
that you're not bein' truthful
with me.

15:22.167 --> 15:25.467
-Right.
-So, why don't we start over?

15:25.500 --> 15:28.267
I want you to tell me
your real name and your
real date of birth.

15:28.300 --> 15:30.833
-It's my real name, bro.
Well, what'd you guys
pull me over for?

15:30.867 --> 15:32.633
What's going on?
-You look really familiar?

15:32.667 --> 15:34.433
-Like who?
Familiar from who?
-You look like I know you

15:34.467 --> 15:36.300
before, and I don't think
your name is Jesus.

15:36.333 --> 15:38.133
-You don't know me.
-No?

15:38.167 --> 15:39.833
-No.
I'm pretty sure of that.

15:39.867 --> 15:41.500
-Sit tight here.
I'll be right back, okay?

15:41.533 --> 15:44.067
-Yes, sir.
-Hey, if you're lyin' to me,
I'm gonna take you to jail.

15:44.067 --> 15:45.667
-Yes, sir.
-So here's your last chance.

15:45.700 --> 15:49.233
Your last chance...
in the world, or I'm gonna
take you to jail.

15:49.267 --> 15:51.567
-No, that's fine, yeah, uh,
I'm stick-- yeah-- I know,
I know--

15:51.600 --> 15:54.233
-You had
an Arizona ID card, right?
-No, I don't have no ID.

15:54.267 --> 15:56.067
You guys asked me that
three times already.
-Hang tight.

15:56.100 --> 15:57.667
-Yes, sir.
This is crazy, bro.

15:57.700 --> 15:59.867
-Life is crazy sometimes.

16:01.367 --> 16:04.567
-He is giving me the name
Jesus, and we believe
his real name

16:04.600 --> 16:08.567
is... Ivan.
I'm gonna run
this guy's information

16:08.600 --> 16:11.400
to see if he is being truthful.

16:11.433 --> 16:13.400
-The only reason why
we're out here talkin' to you

16:13.433 --> 16:17.900
is 'cause you resemble somebody
we're lookin' for, that we need
to talk to about a case

16:17.933 --> 16:20.367
we're lookin' at.
-What kinda case?

16:20.400 --> 16:22.700
-That is the detective's
call, not mine.

16:25.067 --> 16:27.167
-Ivan, you have anything on you
you shouldn't have?
-No, sir.

16:27.200 --> 16:28.900
-No? Put your hands
behind your back.

16:28.933 --> 16:31.667
Don't-- don't stand up.
-What the (bleep)?
I'm not even movin',

16:31.700 --> 16:33.633
bro, like, what do you think
I'm gonna do, run?

16:33.667 --> 16:36.100
I'm not that dumb.
-I didn't tell you
to stand up, did I?

16:36.133 --> 16:37.333
-No, sir.
-All right.

16:37.367 --> 16:39.500
-I'm not that dumb,
I'm not gonna run.

16:39.533 --> 16:41.367
I know-- I know
you get charged for running.

16:41.400 --> 16:42.900
-That's-- that's true.

16:42.933 --> 16:44.300
-I'm not gonna do that,
that's dumb.

16:44.333 --> 16:46.433
-Ivan, you're under arrest
for a felony warrant.

16:46.467 --> 16:50.400
-A felony warrant?
For what?

16:50.433 --> 16:54.067
-Ivan, you have a felony
warrant for your arrest.
-Who's Ivan? I'm not Ivan, bro.

16:54.067 --> 16:56.533
And I have no warrants
or nothing, bro, I have--
I'm clean,

16:56.567 --> 17:00.167
so obviously nothing
is gonna come back.
-Get up. Get up.

17:00.200 --> 17:01.500
Follow this way.

17:01.533 --> 17:03.567
-Hey, call my uncle
and (bleep), bro.

17:03.600 --> 17:08.433
Tell him what's up.
I'm going to jail.
I didn't even do nothing, bro.

17:12.433 --> 17:15.433
-Who's that?
-I don't know.

17:15.467 --> 17:17.067
-That's you!

17:17.067 --> 17:19.133
-Now is your time
to tell me if your real name
is Ivan, 'cause if you

17:19.167 --> 17:22.633
wanna stick with the name
that you've given us originally,
go for it.

17:22.667 --> 17:25.133
But that extra charge
is gonna come true.
-Right, yeah, my name's Ivan.

17:25.167 --> 17:26.667
Yes, um-- Yeah, that's me.

17:26.700 --> 17:28.633
-Okay. Thank you.
-Yes, sir.

17:28.667 --> 17:30.233
-Why weren't we honest
upfront at the beginning?

17:30.267 --> 17:32.233
-I didn't want any cuffs
right now, you know
what I'm sayin'?

17:32.267 --> 17:33.900
Like-- You already--
You pretty much know
who I am.

17:33.933 --> 17:35.567
-Turn around.
-Anything on you
you shouldn't have?

17:35.600 --> 17:37.300
-No.
-No?

17:37.333 --> 17:39.600
-So dumb, bro.
I didn't even do nothing, man.

17:39.633 --> 17:41.467
-Yeah, you did,
'cause you got a warrant
for your arrest.

17:41.500 --> 17:42.967
-Yeah, yeah, I got a warrant,
yeah, I know.

17:43.067 --> 17:44.600
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

17:44.633 --> 17:45.967
That's just money.

17:46.067 --> 17:47.600
All I've got is four dollars.

17:47.633 --> 17:49.100
-All right, man.

17:49.133 --> 17:51.967
-* So I gotta
keep hustlin'... *

17:52.067 --> 17:53.700
I'm gonna get up
outta the jail, watch.

17:53.733 --> 17:54.733
This rap (bleep) gonna blow.

17:54.767 --> 17:56.133
-Is it?
-Yep.

17:56.167 --> 17:57.267
-Cut me one.

17:57.300 --> 17:58.633
-Look, you wanna hear
a rap, though?

17:58.667 --> 18:01.067
-Cut me one.
-Yeah, let's hear it, dude.

18:01.067 --> 18:03.067
-How the--
how the beat go?

18:03.100 --> 18:05.233
(snapping fingers)

18:05.267 --> 18:07.833
* They say it's life,
they say it's better to give *

18:07.867 --> 18:10.067
* But I just take it,
got my eyes closed,
screamin' out, Lord *

18:10.067 --> 18:12.833
* Well, will I make it?
If you say my time
is comin', then cool *

18:12.867 --> 18:16.433
* I'll just be patient,
sleepless nights with this broad
in the house that be stinking *

18:16.467 --> 18:18.733
* One dollar to my name
from the pennies
I been scrapin' *

18:18.767 --> 18:21.533
* Mama's smokin'
all my dope, she found
the birdies I been savin' *

18:21.567 --> 18:24.233
* If I make it to the top,
that'd really be amazin' *

18:24.267 --> 18:26.600
* But for now
I'm on the block thinkin'
'bout my next payment *

18:26.633 --> 18:29.300
* Blowin' trees
to ease my mind,
then I moved up to the pills *

18:29.333 --> 18:31.800
* Then I started
sippin' syrup, that's when
all of it got real *

18:31.833 --> 18:34.200
* Even though my pockets hurt,
and I ain't had
the nerve to steal *

18:34.233 --> 18:36.933
* Always (bleep) me
(bleep) and kept it real *

18:36.967 --> 18:38.333
* It ain't that hard
to hold it down *

18:38.367 --> 18:40.100
* It ain't that hard
to be a G *

18:40.133 --> 18:42.367
* It ain't that hard
to spot a fake, there ain't
too many around me *

18:42.400 --> 18:44.767
* A savior to my country
what I really wanna be *

18:44.800 --> 18:47.800
* Don't wanna
be a race statistic,
falling victim to the streets *

18:47.833 --> 18:51.267
* So every day I get
smoked out and then-- *

18:51.300 --> 18:53.200
-Somethin', I don't remember
the rest, bro.
-(laughs)

18:53.233 --> 18:55.733
-You know how it goes.
-Not too bad.

18:55.767 --> 18:57.400
-I been mixing a little.
You know what I'm sayin'?

18:57.433 --> 18:58.933
-That's good.
-How long you
been rappin' it?

18:58.967 --> 19:01.767
-I been rappin'
for five, six years.

19:01.800 --> 19:05.833
I moved to Texas
when I was about 11, 12.

19:05.867 --> 19:09.667
-So lemme ask you a question,
why don't you do that versus...

19:09.700 --> 19:10.800
what's gotten you in trouble?

19:10.833 --> 19:13.333
-What's got me in trouble?
-Your past.

19:13.367 --> 19:15.667
-The only thing that got me
in trouble was me fighting
with my sisters.

19:15.700 --> 19:17.500
-Yeah, well,
you're not in handcuffs
because of fighting

19:17.533 --> 19:19.333
with your sisters.
-Like, me fighting
with my sisters--

19:19.367 --> 19:21.367
-It's the drugs.
-And-- and-- and, uh-- and, uh--

19:21.400 --> 19:24.833
uh... what's it called?
Yeah, the drugs,
the narcotic drugs.

19:24.867 --> 19:27.367
-So that's what I'm asking,
why don't you take
what you've got

19:27.400 --> 19:31.067
talent-wise and put that forth
effort instead of the drugs?

19:31.067 --> 19:34.900
-In the rap (bleep),
that's what comes
with the rap.

19:34.933 --> 19:36.433
-Nooo! Come on.

19:36.467 --> 19:38.300
-Well, to me, it does.
-So here's what happening.

19:38.333 --> 19:40.800
These guys that just pulled up,
they're gonna transport
you down, okay?

19:40.833 --> 19:42.767
They're bookin' you
on just your warrant,
all right?

19:42.800 --> 19:44.200
-Okay, that's cool.

19:44.233 --> 19:46.333
-Who's Jesus?
-I don't know, dude.

19:46.367 --> 19:47.833
-You don't know?
-I just made that name up.

19:47.867 --> 19:48.900
-Oh.

19:50.067 --> 19:52.167
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:52.200 --> 19:54.133
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:54.167 --> 19:55.300
Cover is code three.

19:55.333 --> 19:58.300
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:05.133 --> 20:06.700
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:09.367 --> 20:13.000
-(theme music playing)
