WEBVTT

00:00.049 --> 00:03.098
Ladies and gentlemen,
for the first time ever

00:03.198 --> 00:08.269
Mr. and Marshall Eriksen
and Lily Aldrin.

00:13.397 --> 00:17.329
Does it make you kind of sad that
we don't share the same last name?

00:17.599 --> 00:21.266
You know, in a totally evolved
21st-century kind of way,

00:21.366 --> 00:22.693
yeah, a little.

00:23.293 --> 00:24.574
You know what we should do?

00:24.674 --> 00:26.971
We should come up with
a whole new last name.

00:27.071 --> 00:30.349
Oh, that's easy--
Lily and Marshall Skywalker.

00:30.959 --> 00:33.179
Lily and Marshall Hasselhoff.

00:34.115 --> 00:35.580
I got it. You ready?

00:35.684 --> 00:36.531
- You ready?
- Yeah.

00:36.633 --> 00:38.878
Lily and Marshall Awesome.

00:39.561 --> 00:41.029
Have you met the Awesomes?

00:41.129 --> 00:44.340
Marshall, Lily, their son,
Totally and their daughter, Freakin'?

00:45.106 --> 00:46.902
I love you, Mr. Awesome.

00:47.008 --> 00:48.800
I love you, Mrs. Awesome.

00:52.056 --> 00:53.680
- So...
- So...

00:53.786 --> 00:55.073
Wedding's over.

00:55.175 --> 00:56.423
Yes, it is.

00:56.586 --> 00:58.752
I guess starting tomorrow,

00:58.855 --> 01:00.203
we can tell people.

01:00.726 --> 01:02.080
Tell people what?

01:02.605 --> 01:03.571
Hi, Barney.

01:03.676 --> 01:04.792
Tell people what?

01:04.894 --> 01:06.331
The food looks delicious,
doesn't it?

01:06.368 --> 01:07.551
Tell people what?

01:07.655 --> 01:08.371
Nothing.

01:08.477 --> 01:10.731
Oh, okay. Tell people what?

01:10.888 --> 01:11.971
Can we talk about this later?

01:12.007 --> 01:13.840
Absolutely. Tell people what?

01:13.947 --> 01:16.660
- Hi. Have you met Barney?
- Hey. Barney Stinson.

01:16.768 --> 01:18.793
Lovely dress.
I know, I'm sick of these things, too.

01:18.827 --> 01:21.170
It's like the same wedding over and
over again. You're totally right.

01:21.207 --> 01:23.732
You want to dance? Great,
see you out there. Tell people what?

01:24.437 --> 01:27.670
Look, this is just not something we want
to talk about right now, okay, Barney?

01:29.577 --> 01:30.572
Okay.

01:32.496 --> 01:34.113
Whoo, that was a close one.

01:34.217 --> 01:35.912
Think he'll actually let it go?

01:36.047 --> 01:38.380
Tell people what?
Tell people what? Tell people what?

01:38.488 --> 01:40.583
Tell people what?
Tell people...

01:41.855 --> 01:45.140
There's a black Nissan Stanza in
the parking lot with it's lights on.

01:45.248 --> 01:46.730
Tell people what?
Tell people what?

01:59.847 --> 02:01.513
Can I get a water please?

02:01.886 --> 02:03.442
- Tell people what?
- Oh, God! Okay.

02:03.545 --> 02:06.741
Look, we have some... news.

02:06.847 --> 02:10.220
But we don't want to draw attention
away from Lily and Marshall's big day.

02:10.328 --> 02:13.031
So just forget about it until
they leave for the honeymoon.

02:13.135 --> 02:14.290
Fine.

02:15.567 --> 02:18.570
- It's pretty big, though.
- Oh, my God, just tell me!

02:18.677 --> 02:20.340
- Oh, help us.
- What's wrong?

02:20.445 --> 02:21.783
We're starving.

02:21.887 --> 02:23.781
We planned this amazing
meal with the caterers,

02:23.886 --> 02:25.483
and we haven't
had a bite of it.

02:25.588 --> 02:28.692
Every time we get near the food,
we get cocktail weiner blocked.

02:31.025 --> 02:32.353
Marshall!

02:57.076 --> 02:58.602
We haven't eaten all day.

02:58.708 --> 03:00.072
All right,
let's run some interference.

03:00.108 --> 03:02.220
Yeah, we'll get you back to your table.
Come on.

03:03.468 --> 03:05.770
Oh, there you are.

03:05.875 --> 03:08.203
My dear, you look so beautiful.

03:08.305 --> 03:09.710
Thanks, Grammie,
but we really need to...

03:09.748 --> 03:13.381
And you...
you look like a 1940s movie star.

03:13.487 --> 03:16.050
And you look like a pepper-crusted
rack of lamb with mint jelly.

03:16.157 --> 03:18.120
All right,
let's get these two back to their table.

03:18.157 --> 03:21.791
We will see you on the floor for
the conga line later, won't we?

03:21.898 --> 03:24.932
The answer to that one
was decided weeks earlier.

03:26.885 --> 03:27.861
Conga line.

03:27.967 --> 03:30.073
Oh, yes, definitely.

03:30.265 --> 03:33.093
How about a slide show of
you guys through the years

03:33.197 --> 03:35.981
set to Green Day's
"Time of Your Life"

03:36.085 --> 03:38.991
and ending with your baby
photos side by side.

03:39.095 --> 03:42.363
Oh, that's great.
Going on the list.

03:42.466 --> 03:43.293
What list?

03:43.395 --> 03:47.642
Horrible wedding clichés we're not going
to touch with a ten-foot limbo pole.

03:47.746 --> 03:49.722
Oh, like First Corinthians?

03:49.828 --> 03:51.133
That Bible verse?

03:51.235 --> 03:52.433
They do that at every wedding.

03:52.526 --> 03:53.481
How's it go?

03:53.585 --> 03:56.070
"Love is patient and kind.

03:56.177 --> 03:57.952
"Love does not envy or boast.

03:58.057 --> 04:00.231
"It is not arrogant or rude.

04:00.338 --> 04:02.441
"Love does not insist
on it's own way.

04:02.546 --> 04:05.480
"It is not irritable
or resentful.

04:05.585 --> 04:07.270
"Love bears all things,

04:07.727 --> 04:09.510
"believes all things,

04:09.937 --> 04:11.613
"hopes all things...

04:12.396 --> 04:14.122
"endures all things."

04:16.356 --> 04:18.390
- Lame.
- Going on the list.

04:18.786 --> 04:21.933
We've done it.
A wedding with zero clichés.

04:22.038 --> 04:25.262
Wait, isn't doing it in the reception
hall bathroom kind of a cliché?

04:25.365 --> 04:26.880
Well, okay, one cliché.

04:26.988 --> 04:28.973
Well, technically two.

04:29.706 --> 04:32.602
No! They cleared
our plates again!

04:32.707 --> 04:36.011
Pepper-crusted rack of lamb,
where did you go?!

04:36.418 --> 04:39.731
It's my wedding night.
I was supposed to have my way with you.

04:40.138 --> 04:42.053
Well, you still have me.

04:42.155 --> 04:43.242
Yeah...

04:44.528 --> 04:46.741
Anyway, guys, we're kind of
in the middle of something,

04:46.845 --> 04:49.712
so if you could go bicker or
share a tense, sexless silence

04:49.817 --> 04:52.090
or whatever married people do
somewhere else, that'd be great.

04:52.127 --> 04:53.952
No, Barney, this is my wedding,

04:54.056 --> 04:55.792
and I will sit wherever
I damn well...

04:55.895 --> 04:57.272
Are those mini quiches?

04:58.797 --> 05:00.103
Tell the secret.

05:00.278 --> 05:01.773
Okay, uh...

05:01.888 --> 05:03.442
it was our anniversary,

05:03.547 --> 05:05.372
so we went to this
restaurant Carmichael's,

05:05.478 --> 05:07.322
which is where we went
on our first date.

05:07.958 --> 05:11.121
Remember, the place where I stole
the blue French horn for Robin?

05:11.438 --> 05:13.101
Oh, right, that was you.

05:13.205 --> 05:15.040
I knew that was
somebody I knew.

05:15.146 --> 05:15.943
What?

05:16.047 --> 05:17.192
Dude, you were there.

05:17.298 --> 05:20.671
That was like a big iconic
moment in all of our lives.

05:20.775 --> 05:23.150
Maybe in your life--
I got a lot of stuff going on.

05:24.055 --> 05:27.300
Okay, so we're sitting there
and the waiter comes over...

05:27.578 --> 05:28.720
Champagne?

05:28.825 --> 05:30.801
Um, we didn't order champagne.

05:30.908 --> 05:32.363
Compliments of the house.

05:32.468 --> 05:33.250
Wow.

05:33.368 --> 05:34.730
Thanks.

05:36.285 --> 05:37.160
Cheers.

05:37.266 --> 05:40.463
And there, sitting at the bottom
of my champagne glass is...

05:40.568 --> 05:41.561
Mini quiche.

05:41.667 --> 05:43.353
You're a mega-douche.

05:43.455 --> 05:46.381
Oh, that's right, they moved that
table back toward the kitchen,

05:46.486 --> 05:48.943
because that's where they're setting
up a surprise chocolate fountain.

05:48.975 --> 05:51.050
Oh, no, I gave it away.

05:55.595 --> 05:57.092
So what was in the glass?

05:57.197 --> 05:57.970
Right.

05:58.075 --> 06:00.620
So the waiter comes up
with two glasses of Dom.

06:00.727 --> 06:02.952
He says, "Champagne?"
"We didn't order any champagne."

06:03.058 --> 06:04.551
"Compliments of
the house." "Wow."

06:04.655 --> 06:06.453
You said that already!

06:06.556 --> 06:08.862
Right. So Robin looks down,

06:08.965 --> 06:11.830
and there at the
bottom of her glass...

06:11.938 --> 06:14.041
Is an engagement ring.

06:16.206 --> 06:18.442
Anything you want to say
to the bride and groom?

06:18.598 --> 06:20.770
Don't get married.

06:21.836 --> 06:23.770
Why don't I come back.

06:27.804 --> 06:29.541
An engagement ring?

06:29.643 --> 06:31.718
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

06:31.811 --> 06:33.419
Ted, you cannot do
this to me. No.

06:33.519 --> 06:34.951
No, no, no!

06:36.816 --> 06:38.412
That's what she said.

06:38.777 --> 06:39.880
No.

06:40.465 --> 06:43.622
No, no, no, no, no.
Ted, you cannot do this to me.

06:43.726 --> 06:45.642
No. No, no, no.

06:45.745 --> 06:46.940
What are you talking about?

06:47.047 --> 06:50.783
This. This is what I'm talking about.
What is this doing in my champagne?

06:50.888 --> 06:52.853
Oh, God, listen...
I just got to get out of here.

06:52.956 --> 06:54.392
That's not mine.

06:54.497 --> 06:55.552
What?

06:55.656 --> 06:57.343
That's not mine.

06:57.446 --> 06:58.952
Then whose is it?

06:59.555 --> 07:00.771
It's mine.

07:04.457 --> 07:05.652
Janna...

07:05.888 --> 07:07.611
will you marry me?

07:07.718 --> 07:09.211
Yes.

07:15.826 --> 07:17.012
Wow.

07:18.118 --> 07:22.250
That was hilarious.
I was like... what?

07:22.878 --> 07:24.152
Anyway.

07:25.327 --> 07:26.831
What the hell was that?

07:27.217 --> 07:28.783
What the hell was what?

07:28.887 --> 07:30.540
That reaction?

07:30.828 --> 07:32.353
I thought you were
proposing to me.

07:32.457 --> 07:35.861
Really? Because it sounded like you
thought I was trying to set you on fire.

07:35.965 --> 07:38.131
Ted, you know how I
feel about marriage.

07:38.237 --> 07:39.593
Now more than ever.

07:39.697 --> 07:41.700
I'm sorry,
were you planning on proposing tonight?

07:41.807 --> 07:42.402
No.

07:42.437 --> 07:43.493
Then why is this an issue?

07:43.596 --> 07:45.153
Because even though you
don't want to get married,

07:45.186 --> 07:47.273
I'd like to think the fact that
we've been together for a year,

07:47.307 --> 07:49.700
and that we love each other
might get me a gentler reaction

07:49.806 --> 07:52.942
than, "No.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

07:53.045 --> 07:54.810
"Ted, you cannot do this to me.

07:54.916 --> 07:57.351
"No. No, no, no."

07:58.306 --> 08:00.871
Okay, you're right, I just...
freaked out.

08:00.978 --> 08:02.430
I don't know why.

08:02.656 --> 08:04.040
I'm sorry.

08:04.975 --> 08:06.830
Can we please just let it go?

08:08.115 --> 08:09.403
No.

08:11.436 --> 08:12.762
Hey, Stinson.

08:13.915 --> 08:16.132
Never lie to a man about
a chocolate fountain.

08:17.105 --> 08:19.003
So did you guys find
anything to eat?

08:19.105 --> 08:21.581
I had four strawberries.

08:21.688 --> 08:24.990
Was there a side of champagne
with each of the strawberries?

08:25.096 --> 08:26.400
Yes.

08:27.658 --> 08:31.353
Lily, you could have burped
or said the word "Yes,"

08:31.455 --> 08:34.940
but the fact that you did both
is exactly why I married you.

08:35.937 --> 08:38.131
Oh, look, more strawberries!

08:39.745 --> 08:41.352
So what happened next?

08:41.455 --> 08:43.640
- Ted, don't do this.
- No, seriously.

08:43.745 --> 08:45.443
Where do you see
yourself in five years?

08:45.548 --> 08:47.063
Where do you see yourself?

08:48.088 --> 08:50.391
Honestly, in five years...

08:50.688 --> 08:52.702
I probably want to be married.

08:52.805 --> 08:56.831
And I probably want
to be in Argentina.

08:56.937 --> 08:59.800
- Argentina?
- Or Tokyo, or Paris.

08:59.908 --> 09:02.642
Look, Ted, I don't know where
I'm going to be in five years.

09:02.745 --> 09:05.672
And I don't want to know.
I want my life to be an adventure.

09:07.495 --> 09:09.623
We have an expiration date,
don't we?

09:11.206 --> 09:12.571
Oh, my God.

09:12.857 --> 09:14.563
You guys broke up.

09:19.767 --> 09:22.282
You guys broke up.
I can't believe it.

09:22.388 --> 09:23.573
Barney...

09:23.815 --> 09:25.440
story's not over.

09:25.786 --> 09:28.390
Can we please not talk about this here.
Can we go home?

09:29.085 --> 09:30.230
Yeah, of course.

09:30.337 --> 09:32.280
Uh, excuse me, I'm sorry about this.
Can we actually...

09:32.315 --> 09:33.820
Oh, my God, it's you.

09:33.925 --> 09:35.333
Wha... what?

09:35.436 --> 09:39.342
You're the son of a bitch who
stole our blue French horn.

09:40.076 --> 09:41.022
Run!

09:41.317 --> 09:43.521
Run? Your strategy was run?

09:43.626 --> 09:44.932
It was a perfectly good idea.

09:45.038 --> 09:46.573
They didn't have our
credit card information.

09:46.607 --> 09:47.860
They didn't know us from Adam.

09:47.968 --> 09:48.961
I stand by it.

09:49.065 --> 09:49.660
Yeah?

09:49.736 --> 09:51.292
And how did that
work out for you?

09:54.536 --> 09:57.211
I don't see why they had to keep
my credit card and driver's license

09:57.217 --> 09:58.741
till we bring the horn back.

09:58.846 --> 10:00.711
Well, come on, Ted,
can you blame them?

10:00.817 --> 10:02.823
Look, I'm sorry about
the French horn.

10:02.925 --> 10:04.542
I want to make this right.

10:04.727 --> 10:07.923
So what we're going to do right now is,
we're going to run!

10:12.747 --> 10:14.950
So... Argentina.

10:15.056 --> 10:16.561
Argentina.

10:16.726 --> 10:18.953
Why is this the first
I've heard of Argentina?

10:19.055 --> 10:21.710
Mmm, American schools
suck at geography.

10:22.396 --> 10:25.441
What would be the point in telling
you that I want to live in Argentina?

10:25.545 --> 10:26.621
You don't want to live there.

10:26.658 --> 10:27.940
I could want to
live in Argentina.

10:27.978 --> 10:28.953
No, you couldn't.

10:29.057 --> 10:31.021
I mean,
you life is here and your career.

10:31.128 --> 10:33.212
I'm a journalist,
my career could take me anywhere,

10:33.406 --> 10:35.042
and I hope it does.

10:35.146 --> 10:37.370
Hey. I could be an
architect anywhere, too.

10:37.476 --> 10:39.263
They have buildings
in Argentina.

10:39.365 --> 10:41.720
And Paris. And even Tokyo.

10:41.827 --> 10:44.741
I don't know if you ever saw Godzilla, but
he wasn't knocking down a bunch of tents.

10:44.775 --> 10:47.831
So, what? You're saying you
want to move to Argentina?

10:48.217 --> 10:53.191
Well, I always regretted not taking
a year in college to live abroad.

10:53.256 --> 10:54.770
I just finished a
big project at work.

10:54.848 --> 10:57.023
I got some money saved up.

10:57.127 --> 11:00.310
If ever there were a time in my life to
do something like this, it's right now.

11:01.027 --> 11:02.900
Let's move to Argentina.

11:03.528 --> 11:04.970
Oh, shut up.

11:05.076 --> 11:07.100
You're scared
I might not be kidding.

11:08.225 --> 11:09.500
Aren't you?

11:09.676 --> 11:10.883
Nope.

11:13.998 --> 11:15.521
Your move, Scherbatsky.

11:18.505 --> 11:19.640
Okay.

11:20.338 --> 11:22.480
Let's do it--
let's move to Argentina.

11:24.606 --> 11:27.250
No es posible!

11:27.427 --> 11:29.650
Nobody moves to Argentina.

11:29.758 --> 11:32.800
The Argentinean peso has dropped
two-thirds in five years,

11:32.906 --> 11:35.190
the government is opposed
to free market reforms,

11:35.298 --> 11:39.591
and the railroad has been a mess since
the breakup of Ferrocarriles Argentinos.

11:40.298 --> 11:42.711
I hooked up with an
Argentinean exchange student

11:42.817 --> 11:44.551
in a Porta-John
outside Yankee Stadium.

11:44.657 --> 11:46.382
Man, she was chatty.

11:46.506 --> 11:47.923
Right? Right?

11:48.566 --> 11:50.483
You caught the bouquet?

11:51.505 --> 11:52.723
Barney.

11:53.325 --> 11:55.020
The story's not over yet.

11:55.887 --> 11:57.490
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- What?

11:58.597 --> 12:00.160
I don't know if I
can do this to you.

12:00.266 --> 12:00.951
Do what?

12:01.058 --> 12:02.990
Well, you say you want
to move to Argentina,

12:03.097 --> 12:05.561
but you want to have kids.

12:05.668 --> 12:07.821
Oh, right.
'Cause there are no kids there.

12:07.927 --> 12:11.271
On Santa's map of the world,
there's a big black "X" over Argentina.

12:11.376 --> 12:13.872
- You know what I mean.
- No, I don't.

12:13.976 --> 12:16.392
Okay, say we had kids.

12:16.497 --> 12:18.931
They wouldn't have to grow
up in some suburb somewhere.

12:19.037 --> 12:21.923
They would grow up on the road
having adventures with us.

12:22.028 --> 12:25.152
Think of all the Hard Rock Cafe
T-shirts they could collect.

12:25.765 --> 12:28.810
Ted, you know that kids were
never a part of my plan.

12:30.866 --> 12:33.721
But if I was going to
have someone's babies,

12:35.168 --> 12:36.653
I'd have your babies.

12:36.755 --> 12:38.102
That's when you run.

12:38.208 --> 12:39.851
Tell me you ran, Ted.

12:45.238 --> 12:47.911
Wait, wait, wait. We don't want to
start having babies right this second.

12:47.946 --> 12:48.941
Do you have a...?

12:49.047 --> 12:50.260
No, I don't.

12:50.366 --> 12:53.002
Well, we probably shouldn't.

12:53.505 --> 12:54.631
Yeah.

13:00.816 --> 13:02.300
- Risk it?
- Risk it.

13:19.277 --> 13:20.493
No.

13:22.827 --> 13:26.653
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
if you're all gather around,

13:26.757 --> 13:29.312
Lily and Marshall are
going to cut the cake.

13:29.415 --> 13:31.811
No. Robin, you're not...

13:31.917 --> 13:34.120
No, say the story's not over.

13:34.225 --> 13:35.360
Come on,
they're cutting the cake.

13:35.396 --> 13:36.872
Say the story's not over!

13:36.975 --> 13:41.670
Oh, God, this is the 12th most worried
I've ever been that someone's pregnant.

13:45.556 --> 13:46.791
Okay, Lily.

13:47.145 --> 13:50.513
I'm really hungry, so let's just,
uh, aim for my mouth, okay?

13:50.618 --> 13:53.071
Besides, the smearing the cake
thing's a cliché, remember?

13:53.175 --> 13:55.681
No, it's going to be so funny.

13:55.786 --> 13:57.003
Lily.

13:57.797 --> 14:00.513
Lily, just feed me the cake.

14:01.506 --> 14:04.691
Please, baby, I am so hungry.

14:09.395 --> 14:10.981
Whoopsy-daisy.

14:11.355 --> 14:13.072
And she's okay.

14:13.298 --> 14:15.192
- She's all right.
- That was funny.

14:15.288 --> 14:17.013
And it's time for
the honeymoon.

14:17.958 --> 14:20.880
Guys, guys, guys.
Thank you so much.

14:20.986 --> 14:22.100
We love you.

14:22.286 --> 14:23.261
I love you.

14:23.367 --> 14:26.061
Getting married, having kids.

14:26.168 --> 14:29.401
It's all a mistake.
It's a horrible, horrible mistake.

14:29.508 --> 14:31.682
God, this guy's
giving me nothing.

14:32.605 --> 14:34.352
All right,
have fun in Scotland.

14:34.455 --> 14:37.791
If you see the Loch Ness Monster,
tell him Ted Mosby says, "What's up?"

14:37.895 --> 14:39.913
Nessie's a she, Ted, come on.

14:55.136 --> 14:56.481
Hey, kiddo.

14:58.707 --> 15:02.213
You are going to miss out
on a lot of awesome stuff.

15:02.367 --> 15:04.243
You'll be at home with the kid

15:04.347 --> 15:07.133
while I am out awesome-ing
all over the place.

15:08.145 --> 15:09.932
And you're going to get fat.

15:11.617 --> 15:13.252
The story's not over, Barney.

15:13.355 --> 15:16.682
Okay, time to get the
horn back to the bistro.

15:17.088 --> 15:19.593
Oh, Ted, I don't know if I can go again.
That tuckered me out.

15:19.695 --> 15:21.051
Not a euphemism.

15:21.807 --> 15:26.402
Right. Okay, let me just go change,
and we'll leave.

15:26.506 --> 15:29.462
Whoa, whoa,
you get to change and I don't? Uh-uh.

15:29.568 --> 15:30.922
Solidarity, sister.

15:31.028 --> 15:34.290
That is crazy. I have a change of
clothes and you don't. Suck it up.

15:34.398 --> 15:36.983
Well, if we'd actually moved in
together, all my stuff would be here,

15:37.018 --> 15:38.801
but we didn't, so...

15:48.747 --> 15:49.680
Yeah.

15:50.656 --> 15:52.661
We were all talk, weren't we?

15:56.706 --> 15:58.610
We're not doing this, are we?

15:59.196 --> 16:01.580
I don't want to have
kids in Argentina.

16:01.686 --> 16:04.471
And I don't want to
have kids in Argentina.

16:08.217 --> 16:10.123
So where does that leave us?

16:12.465 --> 16:13.670
Well...

16:15.698 --> 16:18.442
we could stay together and...

16:18.815 --> 16:20.991
pretend this stuff
doesn't matter.

16:24.548 --> 16:25.731
Or...

16:27.126 --> 16:29.461
we could give back
the blue French horn.

16:34.138 --> 16:36.601
You stole a blue
French horn for me.

16:40.506 --> 16:43.500
I would have stolen
you a whole orchestra.

16:54.835 --> 16:56.290
You did break up.

16:56.898 --> 16:57.973
Yep.

16:58.227 --> 16:59.381
You're not pregnant?

16:59.488 --> 17:00.602
Nope.

17:00.947 --> 17:03.333
An-And Marshall and
Lily don't know?

17:03.597 --> 17:06.512
Well, afterwards, uh,
we came by to tell you guys,

17:06.617 --> 17:08.421
but Lily was pretty
stressed out, so...

17:08.528 --> 17:11.011
We decided not to say anything
till after the wedding.

17:15.015 --> 17:16.462
You guys okay?

17:17.107 --> 17:20.781
Well, it hasn't been the easiest
two weeks of our lives, but...

17:21.464 --> 17:22.829
But we're okay.

17:24.646 --> 17:26.381
The open bar helps.

17:26.847 --> 17:28.443
- Excuse me, Miss.
- Hi.

17:28.547 --> 17:30.392
Could I have this dance?

17:32.118 --> 17:34.531
Well, we knew this day
would come eventually.

17:34.637 --> 17:36.331
Take care of her, little man.

17:49.655 --> 17:54.273
This is by far the drunkest
I've ever seen you.

17:56.455 --> 17:57.991
Uh, driver.

18:00.555 --> 18:02.281
Hello!

18:02.386 --> 18:03.573
Ranjit.

18:03.677 --> 18:06.420
Hey, can we make a stop before
we head back to the hotel?

18:06.528 --> 18:08.671
You do not have to stop.

18:08.778 --> 18:13.492
You can be together as man
and wife right back there,

18:13.598 --> 18:15.542
and because we are friends...

18:15.857 --> 18:17.870
I will not watch.

18:19.685 --> 18:23.562
Um, no,
we actually had something else in mind.

18:25.438 --> 18:26.493
Okay.

18:27.806 --> 18:29.293
Lily, go sit down.

18:29.928 --> 18:31.412
Welcome to Wienerburger.

18:31.516 --> 18:32.483
Hi.

18:32.585 --> 18:36.113
Can we get a number one,
please, with no pickles?

18:36.215 --> 18:39.603
And a number four
with no onions.

18:39.708 --> 18:42.223
Let me guess.
Jefferson High prom?

18:42.326 --> 18:43.551
No.

18:44.366 --> 18:45.892
But thank you.

18:46.235 --> 18:47.612
Actually, we just got married.

18:47.715 --> 18:50.880
- Wow. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

18:50.985 --> 18:52.802
That's $7.80.

18:54.408 --> 18:56.100
- Hey, dude.
- Yeah.

18:56.208 --> 19:00.070
I don't know how to say this, but
your wife just threw up in the trash.

19:04.438 --> 19:05.980
My wife.

19:08.486 --> 19:10.610
So Marshall and
Lily were married,

19:10.717 --> 19:12.723
and Robin and I were broken up.

19:12.825 --> 19:14.500
And as hard as it
was at the time,

19:14.605 --> 19:16.500
in the end we both
got what we wanted.

19:16.606 --> 19:19.470
She did eventually go
on to live in Argentina

19:19.578 --> 19:22.123
and Morocco and Greece, Russia,

19:22.225 --> 19:24.082
even Japan for a little while.

19:24.245 --> 19:27.730
And I... well, I met your mom.

19:27.938 --> 19:30.450
I think for the most part if
you're really honest with yourself

19:30.545 --> 19:32.170
about what you
want out of life,

19:32.277 --> 19:33.890
life gives it to you.

19:36.288 --> 19:40.003
Of course, at that moment, all I
really wanted was a scotch and soda

19:40.108 --> 19:41.611
and a cigar.

19:58.078 --> 20:00.102
I'm really sorry
about you and Robin.

20:01.285 --> 20:03.950
I know I was always joking around
about wanting you two to break up,

20:03.987 --> 20:06.743
but you were really
good together.

20:07.346 --> 20:08.512
Yeah...

20:09.315 --> 20:10.652
we were.

20:11.776 --> 20:14.181
She just wasn't the one,
you know?

20:14.287 --> 20:17.253
The one. Oh, Ted, no.

20:17.358 --> 20:21.043
Do not tell me you're going to
start searching for "the one" again.

20:21.145 --> 20:23.113
The only time I want to
hear you saying "the one"

20:23.217 --> 20:26.042
is if it's followed by the
word "hundredth." What up?

20:26.146 --> 20:28.613
No, I need a break
from all that, I...

20:28.717 --> 20:32.213
I just want to get out there and
have fun for a while, you know?

20:32.318 --> 20:33.590
Really?

20:34.175 --> 20:35.500
'Cause...

20:36.236 --> 20:38.723
you know, you've been in
a relationship for a year.

20:38.827 --> 20:42.022
You're going to...
be a little rusty.

20:43.677 --> 20:45.893
- Yeah.
- I'm just saying...

20:47.188 --> 20:49.782
you're gonna need, need,
need some help out there.

20:50.186 --> 20:51.752
Could be.

20:53.575 --> 20:54.863
Ted?

20:55.146 --> 20:56.660
Yes, Barney.

20:58.066 --> 20:59.513
Do you think...

21:03.226 --> 21:05.161
Do you think maybe you might...

21:05.666 --> 21:07.542
need a wingman again?

21:12.247 --> 21:13.290
I do.

21:14.905 --> 21:16.463
Yes!

21:16.777 --> 21:19.021
Yes! We're back.

21:19.127 --> 21:20.853
We are back.

21:20.955 --> 21:24.333
And Ted, my boy,
it's going to be legend...

21:24.438 --> 21:25.641
Wait for it.

21:26.017 --> 21:27.603
