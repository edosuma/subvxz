02:07.752 --> 02:11.321
Six minutes and 30 seconds.

02:11.355 --> 02:13.423
Is it meant to take this long?

02:13.457 --> 02:16.592
<i>Not as far as I'm concerned.</i>

02:16.626 --> 02:18.993
Get his brother!

02:19.027 --> 02:20.761
What's with you?

02:20.795 --> 02:23.630
Makes me nervous is all.

02:23.664 --> 02:25.864
You're not the one
tied up, baby.

02:39.242 --> 02:41.343
- Bravo!
- There it is.

02:56.689 --> 02:59.823
You're off somewhere again.

02:59.858 --> 03:01.491
Was I?

03:01.525 --> 03:03.626
Sorry.

03:04.661 --> 03:06.995
Thinking about what?

03:08.530 --> 03:10.997
I don't know if I'm
thinking about anything.

03:11.032 --> 03:12.732
You don't know
if you were thinking?

03:12.766 --> 03:15.167
Isn't that possible?

03:28.045 --> 03:30.315
Hello.

03:31.885 --> 03:33.987
<i>What do you want me
to do about it?</i>

03:36.157 --> 03:38.491
Okay.

03:38.526 --> 03:40.526
Okay.

03:40.561 --> 03:42.228
I'm doing this for you.

03:42.262 --> 03:44.763
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

03:44.798 --> 03:47.098
<i>All right, bye.</i>

03:56.974 --> 03:58.741
It was my mother.

04:02.279 --> 04:05.247
My father's dying.

04:20.462 --> 04:22.663
You're quite adept with those.

04:22.697 --> 04:25.065
It's easy once you get
the hang of it.

04:25.100 --> 04:26.600
And when did that occur?

04:26.635 --> 04:27.935
What?

04:27.969 --> 04:29.703
How did you get the hang of it?

04:29.737 --> 04:33.138
I was a clerk for an
importer on White street...

04:33.173 --> 04:37.208
Black & Geddes in Manhattan,

04:37.243 --> 04:39.343
ate in Chinatown a lot.

04:39.378 --> 04:40.644
It was cheap.

04:40.679 --> 04:43.013
You craved more excitement,
joined the bureau.

04:43.047 --> 04:45.848
<i>- I suppose.
- And you found it, didn't you,</i>

04:45.883 --> 04:48.317
in mortal combat
with our witness?

04:48.351 --> 04:51.586
I don't really like
to talk about it, sir.

04:51.620 --> 04:53.887
Self-defense in the line
of duty is no crime.

04:53.921 --> 04:55.823
I know.
It's just...

04:57.859 --> 04:59.926
I wish it'd turned out
differently.

04:59.960 --> 05:01.627
With you dd instead of him?

05:01.662 --> 05:04.663
Of course not.

05:04.698 --> 05:08.633
He set upon you unexpectedly

05:08.667 --> 05:12.136
under the pretense
of his need to micturate...

05:13.905 --> 05:15.772
Assaulted you with a stone.

05:15.806 --> 05:17.106
That's right.

05:17.140 --> 05:19.441
- And you shot him.
- I had to.

05:19.476 --> 05:22.244
- In the forehead?
- The chest.

05:22.278 --> 05:23.978
He hit you in the forehead?

05:24.013 --> 05:25.947
Yes.

05:25.981 --> 05:28.248
Hmm.

05:33.520 --> 05:35.821
So he was facing you

05:35.856 --> 05:39.992
while he unsheathed himself.

05:40.026 --> 05:43.628
And yet he had a stone

05:43.662 --> 05:45.829
that you did not see

05:45.864 --> 05:47.497
until he hit you with it.

05:47.531 --> 05:50.032
He grabbed for it,
I don't know.

05:50.066 --> 05:52.767
He scrambled.

05:52.802 --> 05:54.969
It all happened so quickly.

05:59.706 --> 06:01.340
Aren't you gonna eat anything?

06:01.374 --> 06:03.174
The thought of what ingredients

06:03.209 --> 06:07.978
might constitute this filth
repulses me.

06:31.602 --> 06:32.602
Where is it?

06:36.006 --> 06:38.907
Look.

06:40.276 --> 06:42.543
- Bravo.
- I didn't feel a thing.

06:42.577 --> 06:44.545
<i>I knew you were
misleading me,</i>

06:44.579 --> 06:46.413
yet you managed it anyway.

06:46.447 --> 06:49.048
Deception requires complicity,
however subconscious.

06:49.082 --> 06:51.050
We want to be deceived.

06:51.084 --> 06:52.651
Do I have to give it back?

06:52.685 --> 06:55.420
I'm a magician, miss,
not a thief.

06:55.455 --> 06:57.923
There's an excuse that might
come in handy someday.

06:59.592 --> 07:00.892
Thank you.

07:04.162 --> 07:07.064
I saw your brother do that
straitjacket gag once.

07:07.098 --> 07:09.132
Hanging from the top
of the garden pier.

07:09.166 --> 07:11.934
Five feet or 50,
the principle is the same.

07:11.969 --> 07:13.936
Until the rope breaks.

07:13.970 --> 07:15.738
Erik...
Houdini as you know him...

07:15.772 --> 07:18.040
used to do that escape
behind the ghost box,

07:18.074 --> 07:21.176
ere no one could see him.
Playing it out in the open was my idea.

07:21.210 --> 07:23.378
Oh yes, well,
that's much better.

07:23.412 --> 07:27.081
And the milk-can escape...
my innovation as well.

07:29.484 --> 07:31.885
It's no small feat
for a grown man

07:31.919 --> 07:33.920
to slip himself
inside a tin container.

07:33.955 --> 07:35.988
Try a corset and heels.

07:36.023 --> 07:38.291
I'm sure Mr. Hardeen
has had occasion

07:38.325 --> 07:40.359
to help many women
escape from those.

07:40.393 --> 07:42.127
The most challenging
trick of all.

07:44.330 --> 07:45.930
Jesus Christ!

07:45.964 --> 07:48.399
Doesn't anybody here
read a goddamn newspaper?

07:48.433 --> 07:50.334
I do.

07:50.368 --> 07:52.369
Then you know
I'm fucking ruined.

07:52.403 --> 07:53.937
There are ladies present, sir.

07:53.971 --> 07:56.773
I don't give a cunt's hair,
you fucking boob.

07:56.807 --> 07:58.574
My investment...

07:58.608 --> 08:01.209
the Italian fella I told
you about up in Boston...

08:01.244 --> 08:02.844
He was arrested.

08:02.878 --> 08:04.178
Charles Ponzi?

08:04.213 --> 08:07.081
It was a swindle
from start to finish.

08:07.115 --> 08:09.215
I was in up to the limit

08:09.250 --> 08:11.951
and he took me like some
out-of town Jasper.

08:11.985 --> 08:14.520
Every shell game needs a ma.

08:14.554 --> 08:18.123
Nobody legit can guarantee
a return like that, Harry.

08:18.157 --> 08:20.725
I don't have a nickel.

08:20.759 --> 08:23.260
I'm dead.

08:23.295 --> 08:25.295
I'm sitting here right now,

08:25.330 --> 08:27.764
but I'm dead.

08:27.798 --> 08:30.700
You're totally broke?

08:30.735 --> 08:32.769
We'll be okay, doll.

08:32.803 --> 08:34.470
Won't we?

08:34.505 --> 08:36.772
Sure we will.

08:36.807 --> 08:38.539
We'll pull through.
You'll see.

08:38.575 --> 08:40.775
You fat, worthless fool.

08:40.809 --> 08:42.910
Belle, wait.

08:46.415 --> 08:48.816
Well...

08:48.850 --> 08:50.417
What other tricks do you know?

08:55.556 --> 08:57.957
You know I've never
sought notoriety.

08:57.992 --> 09:00.493
Well, it's about to be
seeking you, my friend.

09:00.527 --> 09:02.595
Half the team's indicted.

09:02.629 --> 09:05.497
These players...

09:05.531 --> 09:07.966
Cicotte, Gandil...
where would I have met them?

09:08.000 --> 09:10.901
You've met sport Sullivan.

09:10.936 --> 09:12.970
And Abe Attell obviously.
They're named too.

09:13.004 --> 09:16.506
Poor Abe... one too many
haymakers to the head.

09:16.541 --> 09:19.809
Well, if he hits the mat on this, he
could very well take you with him.

09:19.843 --> 09:21.610
A girl goes to bed
with 10 fellas...

09:21.645 --> 09:24.346
Who's gonna believe her when she
says the 11th is the father?

09:24.380 --> 09:26.048
Arnold,

09:26.082 --> 09:28.316
I admire
your sang-froid,

09:28.351 --> 09:30.885
but I'm not the person
you need to convince.

09:30.919 --> 09:33.220
You were concerned enough
to retain my services,

09:33.254 --> 09:35.822
and I'm telling you now
your concerns were justified.

09:35.856 --> 09:37.924
What do you propose?

09:37.958 --> 09:40.559
Come here, to Chicago.

09:40.594 --> 09:42.294
Into the lion's den?

09:42.328 --> 09:45.430
<i>Yes. But before
you do that,</i>

09:45.465 --> 09:47.499
I want you to think hard
about who in this town

09:47.533 --> 09:49.500
is willing to do you a favor.

10:11.186 --> 10:12.820
Commodore sir.

10:12.854 --> 10:14.721
Jesus.

10:14.755 --> 10:17.089
Well, what is it?

10:17.124 --> 10:19.558
Your visitor...
he's here.

10:19.592 --> 10:21.860
Oh.

10:21.894 --> 10:24.028
Good.
Good.

10:24.062 --> 10:25.863
Show him in.

10:41.511 --> 10:44.913
Well, there's the boy.

10:44.947 --> 10:47.348
May I get you something, sir?

10:47.382 --> 10:49.717
No, I'm fine.
Thank you.

10:49.751 --> 10:51.651
Nonsense.
Get him a drink.

10:53.554 --> 10:56.389
No no, you go on.
I'll do it.

11:01.561 --> 11:03.829
Leave that there,
for chrissake.

11:06.898 --> 11:09.032
So...

11:09.067 --> 11:12.469
Well, look at you...

11:12.504 --> 11:14.604
a proper gentlemen.

11:14.638 --> 11:18.240
My mother raised me well.

11:19.642 --> 11:21.008
Biscuit?

11:30.083 --> 11:32.550
<i>Yeah, he passed
last night</i>

11:32.585 --> 11:35.319
<i>whimpering, vomiting,</i>

11:35.354 --> 11:39.122
couldn't find a place
to settle.

11:39.157 --> 11:41.992
I couldn't do a damn thing.

11:42.026 --> 11:44.560
It's a fucking dog.

11:44.595 --> 11:46.862
You're a stony little bastard.

11:46.897 --> 11:49.164
I'm what time and
circumstance have made me.

11:49.199 --> 11:52.700
Well, your mother
keeps me informed.

11:52.735 --> 11:55.603
Those must be
pleasant conversations.

11:55.637 --> 11:58.038
You have no concept
of the ways that...

11:58.072 --> 12:00.140
that people can be close.

12:00.174 --> 12:02.341
I have a pretty good idea.

12:02.376 --> 12:04.443
You were 54.
She was 13.

12:07.113 --> 12:08.914
You'd have done the same thing.

12:08.948 --> 12:10.415
You don't know me very well.

12:10.450 --> 12:14.218
Oh, I know you
backwards and forwards.

12:14.253 --> 12:17.188
You want anything
you can lay your hands on

12:17.222 --> 12:20.257
<i>and nothing's gonna
stop you from getting it.</i>

12:21.959 --> 12:25.028
I expect nothing less
from my son though.

12:29.866 --> 12:32.366
This reunion over?

12:32.400 --> 12:34.368
I'm dying, boy.

12:37.938 --> 12:40.373
Well, then I will
call you a priest.

12:40.407 --> 12:43.675
You know what this town
was before I came here?

12:47.212 --> 12:49.813
A fucking swamp,

12:49.848 --> 12:53.950
sand blowing through
shitty boardinghouses.

12:53.984 --> 12:56.652
Nobody wanted to come here.

12:56.686 --> 12:58.886
<i>But I drained
that swamp.</i>

12:58.921 --> 13:01.689
I paved those streets.

13:01.723 --> 13:05.659
I put up those hotels.

13:05.693 --> 13:08.161
I made this fucking city.

13:08.195 --> 13:10.863
You and your giant
blue ox, right?

13:10.897 --> 13:14.433
Don't sass me, boy.

13:14.467 --> 13:16.301
I'm just trying
to tell you something.

13:16.335 --> 13:20.338
What are you trying to tell me?

13:22.173 --> 13:26.509
The wrong man
is running this town.

13:34.183 --> 13:37.318
- Where are you going?
- I don't feel well.

14:05.208 --> 14:08.744
He knows I'm unhappy, but
he'd never dream I'd leave.

14:08.778 --> 14:11.313
Neither would Robert.

14:11.347 --> 14:14.149
Pack lightly... one suitcase
for you and Tommy both.

14:14.183 --> 14:16.517
We can buy whatever we need
once we're abroad.

14:16.551 --> 14:20.153
I'd like a fresh start anyway.

14:20.187 --> 14:22.622
The man from Cunard says we're to
be at the dock an hour early.

14:22.656 --> 14:24.357
<i>- We'll meet here and
then go to... -</i>

14:24.391 --> 14:26.959
God damn it!

14:26.993 --> 14:30.429
<i>Dearest?
Hello?</i>

14:32.031 --> 14:35.166
I'm helpless on these
damned things.

14:35.201 --> 14:37.168
<i>I spilled developer
on my trousers.</i>

14:37.202 --> 14:38.636
<i>It's all over
the floor.</i>

14:38.670 --> 14:41.037
I'll get it later.
Sit.

14:53.350 --> 14:55.351
I'll see you later, Mary.

15:03.326 --> 15:06.095
What were you two
conspiring about?

15:06.130 --> 15:08.164
What?

15:08.198 --> 15:10.699
I heard hushed voices.

15:10.733 --> 15:13.234
Oh, just girl talk.

15:13.269 --> 15:17.471
Well, you do like your
little games, don't you?

15:17.506 --> 15:20.408
You seem to enjoy them yourself.

15:37.757 --> 15:39.457
Where are you calling from?

15:39.492 --> 15:41.292
The lobby.

15:41.326 --> 15:43.060
Are you out of your
fucking mind?

15:43.094 --> 15:45.762
I couldn't call from the post office.
It wasn't safe.

15:45.796 --> 15:47.430
You were cleared, weren't you?

15:47.464 --> 15:48.997
There's nothing he can do.

15:49.032 --> 15:50.999
<i>He's not letting go
of this.</i>

15:51.033 --> 15:53.601
Then give him something
he can't argue with.

15:53.635 --> 15:55.002
<i>Like what?</i>

15:57.171 --> 15:58.405
You're a prohi, aren't you?

15:58.439 --> 16:01.207
<i>- Go find bootleggers.
- Any suggestions?</i>

16:01.241 --> 16:04.176
Head out toward may's landing,

16:04.210 --> 16:05.910
along the black horse.

16:05.945 --> 16:07.579
<i>I wouldn't be surprised
if there was</i>

16:07.613 --> 16:09.914
<i>a major illegal distillery
operating there.</i>

16:09.948 --> 16:11.048
How far?

16:11.082 --> 16:12.616
You want me to make
the arrest too?

16:12.650 --> 16:16.719
<i>Just past mile marker 14,
on the left.</i>

16:16.753 --> 16:19.020
Don't get spooked, kid.

16:19.054 --> 16:20.688
No sir.

16:20.722 --> 16:24.757
Now go look like a hero.
And let's not talk again.

16:32.232 --> 16:34.966
Yes, you're standing there.

16:36.435 --> 16:38.936
A lady in distress.

16:38.971 --> 16:40.905
That son of a bitch...

16:40.939 --> 16:42.640
Annabelle.

16:42.674 --> 16:44.542
You can tell me
whatever you want,

16:44.576 --> 16:48.144
but don't scream, don't cry
and don't throw anything.

16:55.217 --> 16:57.018
I had money

16:57.052 --> 16:58.886
under the floorboards.

16:58.920 --> 17:00.454
Harry took it all.

17:00.488 --> 17:02.189
How much?

17:02.223 --> 17:05.025
$3,682.

17:06.794 --> 17:08.761
I counted it every night.

17:08.796 --> 17:11.030
And you want me
to have him arrested.

17:11.064 --> 17:12.865
I sure as hell do.

17:12.898 --> 17:15.000
To get back the money
you lifted from him.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.502
I worked my tail off for it.

17:19.304 --> 17:21.972
My little girl.

17:24.175 --> 17:27.010
You said you wouldn't do this.

17:40.122 --> 17:42.623
This will see you
through the summer.

17:44.192 --> 17:45.925
Come on, let's just
skip to the part

17:45.959 --> 17:47.793
where you say you'll do
anything for me.

17:47.828 --> 17:50.995
Well, I would.

17:51.030 --> 17:53.097
Draw the curtains
and I'll do it right now.

17:53.132 --> 17:55.633
What happened to the tears?

17:55.668 --> 17:58.169
Ride me like you used to

17:58.203 --> 17:59.971
and I'll soak
the pillow through.

18:01.973 --> 18:05.209
I'll keep that one
in my pocket.

18:05.243 --> 18:09.312
And he will, you know.

18:10.714 --> 18:13.216
Mr. Thompson's gift
is to never forget

18:13.250 --> 18:15.452
who owes him what.

18:15.486 --> 18:18.421
It's generally
a good principle.

18:18.456 --> 18:20.922
Harry found her stash
and did a bunk.

18:20.957 --> 18:22.724
I know.

18:22.758 --> 18:25.526
Did you mention I already
gave you $50 myself?

18:25.561 --> 18:28.128
I guess we're both
a soft touch.

18:34.034 --> 18:36.435
Thanks for helping a girl out.

18:44.743 --> 18:46.443
I thought you might
like to hear...

18:46.478 --> 18:50.345
The league of women voters is going
to formally endorse Mr. Bader.

18:50.380 --> 18:52.013
That's wonderful.

18:52.047 --> 18:54.248
Then I'm glad to have
been of use to you.

19:03.621 --> 19:06.055
How did he look?

19:07.591 --> 19:10.659
Looks like he's dying.

19:10.693 --> 19:14.028
He smelled like garlic.

19:14.062 --> 19:17.798
He says you two see each other.

19:17.832 --> 19:22.202
We began keeping in touch.

19:22.236 --> 19:24.738
We have you in common
after all.

19:24.772 --> 19:27.474
When you enlisted,
he called me.

19:27.508 --> 19:30.976
He was very concerned.

19:31.010 --> 19:34.479
He lost his brother
at the battle of vicksburg.

19:34.513 --> 19:36.781
Well, he needn't have worried.

19:36.815 --> 19:39.083
I told him you would come back.

19:40.985 --> 19:43.420
Lady Jean told me so.

19:43.454 --> 19:45.756
The fortune-teller?
Ma, Jesus.

19:45.790 --> 19:49.059
She was right, wasn't she?

19:49.093 --> 19:51.828
There's rhubarb pie.

19:53.530 --> 19:56.232
You were 13 years old.

19:58.535 --> 20:02.638
You were by yourself.
And you had me.

20:02.672 --> 20:05.340
I wasn't completely alone.

20:05.374 --> 20:08.876
Nucky Thompson
was looking after us.

20:10.879 --> 20:13.113
And why was he doing that?

20:13.148 --> 20:15.949
He was the sheriff.

20:15.984 --> 20:17.984
He worked for your father.

20:18.019 --> 20:20.187
And...

20:20.221 --> 20:22.622
Well...

20:22.657 --> 20:24.758
You remember this?

20:29.529 --> 20:32.731
May day, 1897.

20:32.765 --> 20:36.534
I was one of
king Neptune's consorts.

20:39.238 --> 20:42.072
Your father saw me.

20:42.106 --> 20:44.107
And Nucky worked for him.

20:44.141 --> 20:46.743
And later that day...

20:46.777 --> 20:48.878
Well that night, really...

20:48.912 --> 20:52.147
Nucky brought me to him

20:52.181 --> 20:54.083
because that was
one of the things

20:54.117 --> 20:56.384
he did for the commodore.

20:56.419 --> 20:59.020
And we proceeded
in that fashion

20:59.054 --> 21:01.855
for some time.

21:05.993 --> 21:07.760
A pimp.

21:10.630 --> 21:12.931
An ambitious young man

21:12.965 --> 21:15.700
who wanted to get ahead.

21:15.735 --> 21:17.868
He had a wife.

21:17.903 --> 21:20.337
<i>He wanted
to start a family.</i>

21:20.372 --> 21:22.339
And that makes it okay.

21:22.373 --> 21:24.974
You remember mabel.

21:25.009 --> 21:27.476
She was a lovely woman.

21:27.511 --> 21:30.312
It's a tragedy.

21:33.082 --> 21:37.485
Nucky has been kind in his way

21:37.519 --> 21:40.287
to you and me both.

21:41.989 --> 21:44.624
I suppose the whole affair

21:44.658 --> 21:47.659
has always bothered him.

21:49.362 --> 21:51.996
Do you remember
how long this use to be?

21:53.098 --> 21:55.499
Hmm.

21:59.504 --> 22:01.571
I told the doctor
that I'd meet him

22:01.605 --> 22:04.673
at your father's house.

22:05.942 --> 22:08.944
No one deserves to die alone.

22:32.496 --> 22:35.565
That was the marker
a little ways back.

22:35.599 --> 22:38.967
It should be
around here somewhere.

22:39.002 --> 22:41.469
And this anonymous source

22:41.504 --> 22:44.605
wouldn't have
any reason to lie?

22:54.615 --> 22:56.616
You think maybe there's a...?

22:56.651 --> 22:59.085

23:33.212 --> 23:34.712
Gentlemen.

23:34.747 --> 23:37.581
Special Agent van Alden

23:37.616 --> 23:41.218
with the bureau
of internal revenue.

23:41.252 --> 23:43.653
What's going on here?

23:43.688 --> 23:46.422
Just strengthening
the lord's army

23:46.457 --> 23:49.191
one lost soul at a time.

23:49.226 --> 23:51.994
I call it
"the week of miracles."

23:52.028 --> 23:55.830
"And John did baptize

Deacon Cuffy,

23:58.234 --> 24:00.668
shiloh baptist church
of Atlantic City.

24:00.703 --> 24:03.103
As far as I know, we are
breaking no laws, sir.

24:03.138 --> 24:05.706
You think Christ hears you
in this forsaken place?

24:05.740 --> 24:07.708
Jesus is a wonder worker, sir.

24:07.742 --> 24:11.344
- He hears everybody everywhere...
- Yes.

24:11.378 --> 24:13.212
- ...From the hollows to the hills.
- Yes lord.

24:13.247 --> 24:15.381
Just words, Deacon.

24:15.415 --> 24:17.616
No, sir.
It's the gospel.

24:17.650 --> 24:19.852
And this gospel is truth.

24:19.886 --> 24:22.153
Turn from it however you may,

24:22.188 --> 24:24.922
but every road
leads to a reckoning.

24:24.956 --> 24:27.291
That is what you believe?

24:27.325 --> 24:29.026
That's what I know.

24:29.060 --> 24:31.328
And I'll stake my place
in the kingdom upon it.

24:31.362 --> 24:32.929
- Oh lord.
- Praise Jesus.

24:32.963 --> 24:34.530
Yes lord.

24:34.565 --> 24:35.998
Then carry on.

24:39.301 --> 24:41.269
He that believeth

24:41.303 --> 24:43.904
and is baptized

24:43.939 --> 24:45.439
shall be saved.

24:45.473 --> 24:48.008
Yes, right now.

24:48.042 --> 24:50.177
But he that believeth not

24:50.211 --> 24:52.745
shall be condemned

24:52.780 --> 24:55.181
- to the fires of damnation!
- Yes yes!

24:55.215 --> 24:57.449
Shouldn't we be looking
for that still

24:57.484 --> 25:00.419
your people don't believe
in heaven, do they?

25:00.453 --> 25:02.020
My people?

25:02.055 --> 25:04.789
Don't be glib.
The Jews.

25:04.823 --> 25:07.624
No, not exactly.

25:07.658 --> 25:09.692
Rise up.

25:09.727 --> 25:11.327
Rise up, brothers and sisters.

25:11.361 --> 25:12.995
Hallelujah.
Hallelujah.

25:13.029 --> 25:14.963
Sir, I know you're under
a lot of strain...

25:14.998 --> 25:17.199
But if you don't
believe in heaven,

25:17.233 --> 25:19.067
then how can you
conceive of hell?

25:19.101 --> 25:21.869
<i>- Surrender yourselves.
- Yes yes.</i>

25:21.904 --> 25:24.305
<i>And rid yourselves
of worldly sins.</i>

25:24.339 --> 25:27.007
- Hallelujah.
- And be set free,

25:27.041 --> 25:29.409
unshackled,

25:29.443 --> 25:32.244

Amen. Amen.

27:09.260 --> 27:11.861
He's quite jaundiced.

27:11.895 --> 27:14.062
Has he urinated?

27:14.097 --> 27:16.631
That chamber pot
been empty for days.

27:16.665 --> 27:20.067
There's something wrong with
every organ in his body.

27:25.407 --> 27:27.040
I'd like to run some tests.

27:27.074 --> 27:28.308
Is that really necessary?

27:28.342 --> 27:31.745
Just let me die, damn it.

27:31.780 --> 27:36.516
The commodore don't like
to be fussed with, doctor.

27:36.550 --> 27:38.183
I just need

27:38.218 --> 27:40.552
a hair sample.

27:40.586 --> 27:42.587
No, what are you doing?

27:42.622 --> 27:43.988
- It's all right.
- No.

27:44.023 --> 27:45.490
- Just a little piece of...
- No.

27:45.524 --> 27:47.425
- Look.
- It's okay.

27:47.459 --> 27:49.827
- No, he's trying to kill me.
- He's not trying to kill you, just...

27:49.861 --> 27:52.095
- He's trying to kill me.
- Relax. Relax.

27:52.130 --> 27:54.697
He's trying to help you.
Easy.

27:56.666 --> 27:58.466
He's trying to help you.

27:58.501 --> 28:00.535
Yes.

28:02.137 --> 28:04.405
- Okay?
- Relax.

28:04.439 --> 28:07.607
I'll just take a lock
from the back here.

28:08.876 --> 28:12.545
You're okay.
You're okay.

28:20.552 --> 28:24.221
You're a good son.

28:41.272 --> 28:43.874
Have you eaten anything?

28:46.411 --> 28:49.146
Somebody has to stay
here for him.

28:49.180 --> 28:51.348
I'll stay with him tonight.

29:32.392 --> 29:35.828
So what's the point
of this gathering?

29:35.862 --> 29:37.963
We don't have to go
if you don't want to.

29:37.998 --> 29:41.667
Most of these women were against
suffrage in the first place,

29:41.702 --> 29:44.370
not too big
on immigrants either.

29:44.405 --> 29:46.739
How did their own
ancestors get here?

29:46.774 --> 29:48.942
The daughters of
the American revolution?

29:48.976 --> 29:51.711
Why they grew in the
ground like pumpkins

29:51.745 --> 29:55.015
and marched off with
Washington to valley forge.

29:57.384 --> 29:59.219
I'll do what's required of me.

29:59.253 --> 30:02.722
Not really the right answer.

30:02.757 --> 30:05.892
What answer would you prefer?

30:08.796 --> 30:10.897
What you saw...

30:13.201 --> 30:16.503
What you thought you saw
in my office yesterday

30:16.538 --> 30:19.540
couldn't have been
more innocent.

30:19.574 --> 30:22.276
Annabelle is far from innocent.

30:22.311 --> 30:24.612
And I daresay you've some
experience yourself.

30:24.646 --> 30:28.116
We had a relationship
years ago.

30:28.150 --> 30:29.584
It meant nothing.

30:29.618 --> 30:31.719
I was helping her,
Margaret, that's all.

30:31.753 --> 30:33.721
The way you helped me?

30:33.755 --> 30:35.690
I thought she was your friend.

30:37.560 --> 30:39.494
So you wouldn't fuck her.

30:40.696 --> 30:43.264
That language
does not become you.

30:43.299 --> 30:44.699
Yes.

30:44.734 --> 30:46.401
You'd rather I be demure.

30:46.435 --> 30:48.570
I'd rather you be rational.

30:48.605 --> 30:49.838
Meaning what?

30:49.873 --> 30:52.141
That I say nothing
about what I see,

30:52.175 --> 30:53.575
what I hear?

30:53.610 --> 30:56.278
What have you heard?

30:57.414 --> 30:59.649
That you are capable
of anything.

30:59.683 --> 31:01.884
And who told you that?

31:01.919 --> 31:04.087
Agent van Alden,

31:04.121 --> 31:06.089
while you were out campaigning.

31:06.123 --> 31:07.891
Well, if you didn't
tell me about it,

31:07.925 --> 31:10.660
it couldn't have been
very upsetting.

31:10.694 --> 31:13.329
It made me sick to my stomach.

31:13.364 --> 31:16.099
This whole arrangement does.

31:16.133 --> 31:17.734
What arrangement?

31:17.768 --> 31:20.403
That I'm to accept
what you tell me

31:20.437 --> 31:22.071
and ask nothing more.

31:22.106 --> 31:24.741
That I aid you in the
business you conduct

31:24.775 --> 31:26.943
and pretend I don't know
what that business is.

31:26.977 --> 31:29.345
I don't recall you
ever saying no

31:29.380 --> 31:31.214
to anything I put
in front of you.

31:31.248 --> 31:33.216
You make a little noise
every now and then

31:33.250 --> 31:35.617
to remind me what a good
person you are.

31:35.651 --> 31:38.485
But a good person
wouldn't be here right now.

31:38.520 --> 31:41.153
You don't know what I am.

31:41.188 --> 31:43.121
I don't?

31:50.829 --> 31:52.730
This is what you do.

31:52.764 --> 31:55.299
After you lie down with
me, you go in there,

31:55.333 --> 31:58.401
wash your body with this
poison, like any whore.

31:58.435 --> 32:00.803
I won't have another child.

32:00.837 --> 32:03.638
- By me?
- By any man.

32:03.672 --> 32:05.272
That's not your right
to decide.

32:05.307 --> 32:07.674
Why should you care?
We're not married.

32:07.709 --> 32:10.409
Do you expect
that I would give you...

32:10.444 --> 32:12.311
What, an heir?

32:12.345 --> 32:13.879
Is that what you want me for?

32:13.913 --> 32:15.346
I thought you needed saving.

32:15.381 --> 32:17.014
And that's why
you chose my husband.

32:17.048 --> 32:18.949
What are you talking about?

32:18.983 --> 32:21.884
You knew nothing of him
until I came to you.

32:21.918 --> 32:25.353
What purpose did it serve
to make me a widow?

32:25.387 --> 32:26.786
You need to be careful now.

32:26.821 --> 32:29.288
- Are you threatening me?
- I'm advising you.

32:29.322 --> 32:31.289
Whatever idea you've
gotten into your head...

32:31.323 --> 32:33.756
Your brother came to me
with money.

32:33.790 --> 32:36.157
- To help you.
- To keep me quiet.

32:36.192 --> 32:38.592
Well, you have been,
haven't you?

32:38.627 --> 32:41.093
Not a word about this man

32:41.128 --> 32:42.794
who beat you,

32:42.828 --> 32:45.228
who murdered the baby
you were carrying,

32:45.263 --> 32:47.896
who you loved so very much.

32:47.930 --> 32:51.331
I have not lost one second
of sleep over what was done,

32:51.365 --> 32:53.632
and neither have you.

32:58.737 --> 33:02.104
You won't be needing
that anymore, will you?

33:05.941 --> 33:08.141
Sir.

33:08.175 --> 33:11.042
- Yes?
- Sir, you got a visitor.

33:11.077 --> 33:13.043
Thank you.

33:19.147 --> 33:20.514
How is your father?

33:20.548 --> 33:23.082
He's on his way out.

33:23.116 --> 33:24.982
Mm, I'm sorry.

33:25.016 --> 33:26.549
Honestly,

33:26.583 --> 33:29.616
I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

33:29.651 --> 33:31.784
You're here for your mother.

33:31.818 --> 33:34.052
- It's your duty.
- Yeah.

33:34.086 --> 33:37.520
Chalky...
Mr. White...

33:37.554 --> 33:40.221
Heard back from his man
in Philadelphia.

33:40.256 --> 33:41.889
Any sign of them?

33:41.923 --> 33:44.423
Mrs. D'Alessio...
the mother... is there,

33:44.458 --> 33:48.258
the sisters
and another brother.

33:48.293 --> 33:49.892
Which one?

33:49.927 --> 33:52.094
- Adrian.
- Never heard of him.

33:52.128 --> 33:53.695
He's a dentist.

33:55.930 --> 33:58.197
Um, I could go there.

33:58.231 --> 34:00.631
- Where?
- To Philadelphia.

34:00.666 --> 34:03.699
What good is that?
They're lying low somewhere else.

34:03.734 --> 34:07.234
Well, I would kill
the mother...

34:08.768 --> 34:10.603
The sisters

34:10.637 --> 34:14.036
and the dentist.

34:14.071 --> 34:17.371
That would make them
stick their heads up.

34:19.206 --> 34:21.540
Did you run your tests?

34:21.574 --> 34:23.341
Yes.

34:25.243 --> 34:27.177
I have some information.

34:27.210 --> 34:30.579
We'll talk that over
later, Richard.

34:38.418 --> 34:39.751
We need to speak frankly.

34:39.784 --> 34:41.052
Okay.

34:41.085 --> 34:42.819
Are you the next of kin?

34:42.853 --> 34:46.487
I'm pretty sure I'm not in the
will, if that's what you mean.

34:46.521 --> 34:48.554
Who else stands to gain
from your father's death?

34:48.589 --> 34:50.888
What are you talking about?

34:50.922 --> 34:53.355
The tests are pretty crude,

34:53.389 --> 34:56.356
but there's enough arsenic in
his body to take down a hippo.

34:58.723 --> 35:00.523
Um, I don't want to.

35:00.558 --> 35:02.824
Yes, you do.
You said so.

35:02.858 --> 35:05.725
We're going sailing,
remember...

35:05.759 --> 35:08.026
you, me, aunt Mary...

35:08.060 --> 35:10.728
over the ocean to Paris?

35:10.762 --> 35:11.928
Is daddy coming?

35:11.963 --> 35:14.197
No.

35:14.231 --> 35:16.031
<i>How come?</i>

35:16.065 --> 35:18.466
Daddy's already been there

35:18.500 --> 35:21.600
and he didn't like it.

35:21.635 --> 35:23.535
Come on, hurry.

35:25.404 --> 35:27.571
Aunt Mary is waiting.

35:28.472 --> 35:30.172
Can Gillian come?

35:33.676 --> 35:36.678
No, she doesn't like
Paris either.

35:47.689 --> 35:50.657
Come on.
Let's go meet aunt Mary.

36:17.882 --> 36:19.783
What's he do all day?

36:19.818 --> 36:22.252
Sits there.
He's upset about the house.

36:22.287 --> 36:24.355
It's a miracle
it didn't happen sooner.

36:28.026 --> 36:30.561
The place was a firetrap.

36:34.133 --> 36:37.335
So your lady friend...

36:37.369 --> 36:39.503
Tell me about this row.

36:39.537 --> 36:41.304
It got very ugly.

36:41.339 --> 36:44.207
I fight with June all the time.

36:44.241 --> 36:47.010
We go out to the shed to make
sure the kids don't hear.

36:47.045 --> 36:50.514
The mouth on her...
you'd be surprised.

36:50.549 --> 36:52.116
She knows, Eli.

36:52.151 --> 36:54.218
She suspects, you mean.

36:54.252 --> 36:57.386
How could she know?

37:04.891 --> 37:06.324
You didn't tell her?

37:06.359 --> 37:08.460
I didn't deny it either.

37:08.494 --> 37:11.362
What the fuck
were you thinking?

37:11.396 --> 37:12.830
That I wanted to hurt her.

37:12.864 --> 37:14.431
What do you think
these are for?

37:14.466 --> 37:15.999
That's not who I am.

37:16.034 --> 37:17.367
It isn't?

37:17.402 --> 37:19.436
Who told me to get rid
of her husband?

37:19.470 --> 37:21.404
He deserved it.

37:21.438 --> 37:24.274
Deserved?
Who the fuck are you?

37:24.309 --> 37:27.012
Leave that shit to God
and look after business.

37:27.046 --> 37:28.981
<i>She starts shooting
her mouth off...</i>

37:29.016 --> 37:30.850
- She won't.
- How do you know?

37:30.884 --> 37:32.952
How do you know anything?

37:32.986 --> 37:35.254
I got a bullet in my gut
from what you don't know.

37:35.288 --> 37:37.522
<i>- Calm down, Eli.
- You need to wake up!</i>

37:37.557 --> 37:39.891
Fletcher gets elected...

37:39.926 --> 37:42.327
And he is this close,
brother...

37:42.361 --> 37:43.761
You're telling me?

37:43.796 --> 37:46.998
They are coming after us
with pickaxes.

37:47.032 --> 37:48.934
- This fucking woman...
- Margaret.

37:48.968 --> 37:51.770
This woman is a liability

37:51.804 --> 37:55.140
that you created,
because... Why?

37:55.174 --> 37:57.475
She'll absolve you of all the
sinful shit on your hands?

37:57.510 --> 38:00.312
- Oh stop. - What?
That's how you think.

38:00.346 --> 38:02.180
I didn't ask for your insights.

38:02.215 --> 38:04.216
This is my life on the line!

38:04.250 --> 38:06.251
I got eight kids.

38:06.286 --> 38:08.253
You waltz around town
like it's a circus,

38:08.287 --> 38:12.090
<i>getting your ass kissed,
the king of the freak show.</i>

38:12.124 --> 38:14.192
Nobody cares about you.

38:14.226 --> 38:16.528
They only care about
what you can give 'em.

38:16.562 --> 38:18.263
And that includes
your Irish chippy

38:18.297 --> 38:21.032
<i>who you just handed
a blank check.</i>

38:22.735 --> 38:25.202
You know, it's too bad you didn't
see Hardeen the other night.

38:25.237 --> 38:26.736
What?

38:26.771 --> 38:28.705
It's an entertaining act.

38:28.739 --> 38:32.775
But if he wasn't Houdini's
brother, nobody'd give a fuck.

38:40.984 --> 38:43.786
Hey.

38:43.821 --> 38:45.422
How is he?

38:45.456 --> 38:47.958
Well, he made it
through another night.

38:49.494 --> 38:51.195
I'm surprised.

38:53.733 --> 38:56.602
You want some coffee?

39:01.875 --> 39:04.076
How much money
do you think he has?

39:04.111 --> 39:06.145
Your father?

39:06.180 --> 39:08.114
I have no idea.

39:09.583 --> 39:12.051
But it's enough

39:12.085 --> 39:14.520
to live comfortably,
that's for sure.

39:14.554 --> 39:17.490
I should hope so.

39:17.524 --> 39:20.126
It certainly doesn't seem
as if he's wanting.

39:20.160 --> 39:22.861
No, it certainly doesn't.

39:32.037 --> 39:34.305
Have you talked about
what would happen

39:34.339 --> 39:37.775
if he dies?

39:37.810 --> 39:40.578
I don't know what you mean.

39:43.081 --> 39:45.449
<i>He said
you two were close.</i>

39:45.484 --> 39:49.252
Well, "close" is
a relative term.

39:51.588 --> 39:55.291
I'm not quite sure what
you're getting at, sweetie.

39:55.325 --> 39:57.794
Look, ma,

39:57.829 --> 40:00.263
it's fine with me,
it really is,

40:00.298 --> 40:02.599
whatever you want to do.

40:02.633 --> 40:05.167
The other day I ate
a cookie at his house

40:05.202 --> 40:07.002
and it made me vomit.

40:07.036 --> 40:10.104
And this morning
I found this...

40:12.240 --> 40:13.908
Tucked down,

40:13.942 --> 40:17.044
<i>hidden in his
rubbish pail</i>

40:17.078 --> 40:19.212
in the kitchen.

40:23.317 --> 40:25.551
"50 bucks?"
The fella says.

40:25.585 --> 40:28.020
"Peter stuyvesant paid only 24

40:28.054 --> 40:30.522
for the entire island
of Manhattan."

40:30.557 --> 40:32.791
"Yeah," the whore replies,

40:32.825 --> 40:35.727
"but Manhattan
just lays there."

40:38.364 --> 40:40.031
Peter minuit.

40:40.065 --> 40:41.432
What?

40:41.467 --> 40:44.268
- Peter minuit bought Manhattan.
- Okay.

40:44.302 --> 40:46.068
Get your fucking
facts straight.

40:46.103 --> 40:48.803
<i>- In a joke?
- You think it's funny?</i>

40:48.838 --> 40:50.705
That's the attitude,

40:50.739 --> 40:53.741
the lack of attention to detail
that's fucking killing us.

40:53.776 --> 40:56.444
- I'm sorry, Nuck. - This is the
toughest election in our lifetimes,

40:56.478 --> 40:58.046
and you're standing here
telling jokes.

40:58.080 --> 41:00.015
I'm sorry, Nuck.
We were talking...

41:00.049 --> 41:02.051
You think Fletcher's over
there at the Democratic club

41:02.085 --> 41:03.686
doing a fucking
vaudeville routine?

41:03.721 --> 41:06.423
<i>Well, he's not.
He's out there shaking hands,</i>

41:06.457 --> 41:09.827
trying to steal the election out
from under our goddamn noses.

41:09.861 --> 41:11.595
Come on, Nuck.
The democrats?

41:11.630 --> 41:13.497
The people know
who they can trust.

41:13.531 --> 41:15.899
The people want reform...
women especially.

41:15.933 --> 41:18.935
You've seen the papers...
"corruption, violence,

41:18.969 --> 41:21.937
gunplay on the boardwalk."

41:21.971 --> 41:24.273
I'm making a change.

41:24.307 --> 41:27.175
We have a plan to meet
the future head-on.

41:27.209 --> 41:29.377
And ed Bader here will be
a big part of that.

41:29.411 --> 41:31.913
But he can't do it alone.
He'll need a strong arm

41:31.947 --> 41:34.015
if he's going to be
swinging for the fences...

41:34.049 --> 41:37.084
a strong arm and clean record.

41:37.119 --> 41:39.086
That's why, with great regret

41:39.121 --> 41:41.088
and much gratitude
for years of service,

41:41.123 --> 41:43.257
I have this day accepted
the resignation

41:43.292 --> 41:46.427
of my brother Elias Thompson
for the office of sheriff.

41:46.461 --> 41:49.163
- Eli's out?
- What the hell's going on, Nuck?

41:49.197 --> 41:51.399
- I just told you.
- Well yeah, but...

41:51.433 --> 41:54.168
Deputy Halloran,
the star is yours to wear,

41:54.202 --> 41:56.003
if you'll honor us so.

41:56.038 --> 41:58.172
Well...

41:58.206 --> 41:59.840
Sure I will.

41:59.875 --> 42:02.610
Thanks, Nucky.

42:02.644 --> 42:04.378
I won't let you down.

42:04.413 --> 42:06.647
Then God bless us all.

42:06.682 --> 42:09.717
And good luck on election day.

42:14.221 --> 42:16.222
- Good luck, Halloran.
- How about that?

42:16.256 --> 42:18.423
Mr. harrow
is on the phone.

42:18.458 --> 42:20.892
Congratulations.

42:20.926 --> 42:23.528
Sheriff now.

42:23.562 --> 42:25.797
Hey fellas, fellas,
you wanna race?

42:25.831 --> 42:27.365
I'll race you
all the way to the pier.

42:27.399 --> 42:29.800
Yeah, come on. Come on, hurry up.
Come on, let's go.

42:29.834 --> 42:31.568
Whoa, gee whiz.

42:54.222 --> 42:55.755
How do?

42:55.789 --> 42:57.390
Who are you?

42:57.424 --> 43:00.926
Donald Flance.
I manage the property.

43:00.960 --> 43:03.495
Where are the Dittrichs?

43:03.529 --> 43:05.363
<i>The photographer?</i>

43:05.398 --> 43:08.533
Snuck out yesterday
in the dead of night.

43:11.069 --> 43:13.003
What about his wife?

43:13.037 --> 43:14.304
<i>Wife?</i>

43:14.338 --> 43:16.939
Well, if that's who she was,

43:16.974 --> 43:19.041
I guess she went with him.

43:20.977 --> 43:23.712
<i>The lease says
"broom clean,"</i>

43:23.747 --> 43:26.181
<i>but they couldn't
be bothered.</i>

43:26.216 --> 43:28.016
Where'd they go?

43:28.051 --> 43:30.019
<i>Not sure.</i>

43:30.053 --> 43:32.287
The wife was...

43:32.322 --> 43:35.857
was always talking about Paris.

43:43.099 --> 43:45.467
Look, mommy... ghosts.

44:03.818 --> 44:05.452
I thought you should know...

44:05.486 --> 44:08.021
I'm requesting a transfer.

44:08.055 --> 44:11.090
What brings this on?

44:11.125 --> 44:14.660
I have family near Detroit.

44:14.694 --> 44:16.661
And there's a lot of liquor

44:16.696 --> 44:19.196
coming in across the lake
from Canada.

44:19.231 --> 44:21.265
I heard they were
looking for agents.

44:21.299 --> 44:23.300
Only the best men.

44:23.334 --> 44:25.368
I don't know about that.

44:25.403 --> 44:27.670
Hmm.

44:30.140 --> 44:31.640
May I speak freely, sir?

44:31.674 --> 44:33.675
Please do.

44:34.877 --> 44:36.911
I know you don't trust me.

44:36.945 --> 44:40.214
I'm not sure why, but I'm pretty
confident that's the case.

44:40.248 --> 44:43.083
What makes you think that?

44:43.118 --> 44:46.687
The incessant questions,
the dirty looks,

44:46.721 --> 44:50.056
the insinuations about
my religious beliefs.

44:51.658 --> 44:54.693
We've been over the winslow
shooting 50 times, sir.

44:54.727 --> 44:56.494
Because something
doesn't sit right.

44:56.529 --> 44:58.696
But it doesn't make sense.
Why would I want him dead?

44:58.730 --> 45:01.898
Temptati knows no rank,
Agent Sebso.

45:01.933 --> 45:03.900
What's that supposed to mean?

45:09.439 --> 45:12.240
I do notice you're wearing
new wing tips.

45:12.275 --> 45:14.842
They were on discount.
I got them at Driscoll's.

45:17.545 --> 45:19.146
This is what I mean.

45:19.180 --> 45:21.047
I don't like what you're
implying here, sir.

45:21.081 --> 45:24.550
What you like
is none of my concern.

45:24.584 --> 45:26.718
I need men I can trust.

45:26.753 --> 45:28.353
You can trust me, God damn it.

45:28.387 --> 45:31.723
What do I have to do
to convince you?

45:42.067 --> 45:45.336
I baptize thee in the
name of the father...

45:45.370 --> 45:48.071
- The father.
- Yes.

45:48.106 --> 45:50.240
- ...The son...
- The lord.

45:50.274 --> 45:51.874
Yes lord.

45:51.909 --> 45:55.076
- ...And the holy ghost...
- Amen. Hallelujah.

45:55.110 --> 45:58.279
<i>...In the marvelous
expectation of resurrection</i>

45:58.313 --> 46:01.882
<i>and the righteous blessings
of eternal life...</i>

46:01.916 --> 46:03.717
Deacon Cuffy.

46:05.119 --> 46:07.452
Agent van Alden

46:07.487 --> 46:09.553
of the bureau
of internal revenue.

46:09.587 --> 46:11.020
Have you come here

46:11.054 --> 46:12.988
to be accepted into
the arms of Christ?

46:13.023 --> 46:15.991
I have never
left him, Deacon...

46:16.026 --> 46:17.893
Keep going.

46:17.927 --> 46:20.128
...Though I have at times
turned from his love.

46:20.162 --> 46:22.096
You cannot turn from him, sir.

46:22.131 --> 46:24.932
Whatsoever the compass point,
he is there beside you.

46:24.966 --> 46:27.834
- Yes lord.
- I do know that to be so.

46:30.738 --> 46:34.640
But this man does not.

46:36.809 --> 46:39.210
There is a veil
over his eyes, Deacon,

46:39.244 --> 46:42.513
and a darkness in his soul.

46:43.681 --> 46:45.882
Come forward.

46:45.916 --> 46:47.717
No, thank you.

46:47.751 --> 46:50.319
Young sir, come forward.

46:50.353 --> 46:53.889
- No, thank you.
- Come forward, Mr. Sebso.

46:53.923 --> 46:55.757
I'd really rather not.

46:55.792 --> 46:59.194
You insult these good people
and their beliefs.

46:59.228 --> 47:00.729
They're not my beliefs.

47:00.763 --> 47:02.731
What are you afraid of,
Mr. Sebso?

47:02.765 --> 47:04.031
I'm not afraid. I...

47:04.065 --> 47:05.999
Then let these waters
wash you clean.

47:06.034 --> 47:09.636
- Yes.
- Be washed clean, brother.

47:09.670 --> 47:11.437
Go on now.

47:11.472 --> 47:14.340
- Washed in the blood of the lamb.
- Lord Jesus.

47:15.609 --> 47:17.042
Okay, fine.

47:17.076 --> 47:19.444
Amen.

47:19.478 --> 47:22.346
- Give unto the lord.
- Hallelujah.

47:38.327 --> 47:40.862
I just bought those.

47:49.837 --> 47:52.538
Any believer may baptize,
may he not?

47:52.573 --> 47:54.974
That's a matter
of some dispute.

47:55.008 --> 47:58.343
Will you permit it here?

47:58.377 --> 48:01.479
I will.

48:12.222 --> 48:16.458
Do you accept Jesus
as your savior?

48:16.492 --> 48:17.826
Yes yes.

48:17.860 --> 48:19.561
Am I supposed to hold...?

48:21.563 --> 48:23.497
Unburden your soul,
Mr. Sebso.

48:23.532 --> 48:27.600
Will you confess your sins and
accept Jesus as your savior?

48:27.635 --> 48:30.803
- Amen.
- Look, what do you expect me...?

48:36.008 --> 48:37.942
Confess your sins

48:37.976 --> 48:39.943
and accept Jesus
as your savior.

48:39.978 --> 48:42.479
Accept him, accept him.

48:51.489 --> 48:55.224
I ask you once again,
Agent Sebso,

48:55.258 --> 48:56.959
will you confess your sins

48:56.993 --> 48:59.194
and accept Jesus
as your savior?

48:59.229 --> 49:00.995
No, I don't...

49:09.937 --> 49:11.237
This is not a battle, sir.

49:11.272 --> 49:12.439
You're wrong, Deacon.

49:12.473 --> 49:14.507
It is a battle against
the devil himself.

49:14.542 --> 49:16.510
I have seen him abroad

49:16.544 --> 49:18.578
in the daylight and the night!

49:18.613 --> 49:21.281
And by God
I will force him out!

49:22.783 --> 49:26.552
- Oh Jesus.
- Jesus lord.

49:50.773 --> 49:53.342
Thou hast fulfilled

49:53.376 --> 49:56.612
the judgment of the wicked!

50:50.358 --> 50:53.893
Last night when I came

50:53.927 --> 50:56.362
she sent me away.

50:56.396 --> 50:58.497
Did she say why?

51:00.333 --> 51:03.202
Only that she didn't need me.

51:06.272 --> 51:08.240
She said

51:08.274 --> 51:10.475
that you knew.

51:10.510 --> 51:12.777
And today?

51:15.748 --> 51:17.716
I came

51:17.750 --> 51:19.951
at the regular time.

51:19.986 --> 51:22.654
She was there.

51:22.689 --> 51:25.557
They had suitcases.

51:27.193 --> 51:29.127
She asked me

51:29.161 --> 51:31.129
to return some things

51:31.163 --> 51:33.698
to the neighbor across the way.

51:36.268 --> 51:39.604
When I came back...

51:39.638 --> 51:41.906
They had disappeared.

52:09.734 --> 52:11.702
Let's get you to bed.

52:11.736 --> 52:13.170
I'm not tired.

52:13.205 --> 52:15.339
You're asleep on your feet.

52:22.347 --> 52:25.449
- Boo.
- You scared us.

52:25.484 --> 52:27.619
<i>I didn't mean to.</i>

52:32.625 --> 52:34.092
How's your father?

52:34.126 --> 52:36.894
Turns out he's gonna live.

52:39.432 --> 52:40.732
Let me get that for you.

52:40.766 --> 52:43.301
- It's all right.
- I got it.

52:47.072 --> 52:49.839
I know what you've been up to.

52:49.874 --> 52:51.274
No, you don't.

52:51.308 --> 52:53.443
Yeah, I do.

52:53.478 --> 52:55.845
<i>You've been at Abe Klein's,
haven't you?</i>

52:55.880 --> 52:58.348
How did you know that?

52:58.382 --> 53:00.718
Because you've got
chocolate phosphate

53:00.752 --> 53:03.053
right here.

53:03.088 --> 53:06.156
<i>All right, come on, buddy.
Time to go to bed.</i>

53:06.191 --> 53:08.692
No arguments.

53:13.631 --> 53:16.666
<i>Did you have fun
staying up late?</i>

53:16.701 --> 53:19.335
<i>It's fun, right?</i>

53:19.369 --> 53:22.472
<i>Few years,
you and your old pop...</i>

53:22.506 --> 53:24.874
We're gonna be
keeping all hours.

53:24.909 --> 53:26.843
You'll see.

53:26.877 --> 53:29.178
It'll be just us boys.

53:32.350 --> 53:33.883
All right.

53:33.918 --> 53:36.019
Come on, lay down.

53:36.920 --> 53:39.021
Mwah.

53:44.494 --> 53:46.628
Mommy's gonna tuck you in.
