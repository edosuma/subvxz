00:07.640 --> 00:09.005
What do we do with this?

00:09.075 --> 00:11.771
There can be only one!

00:13.113 --> 00:14.137
Nice.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.355
Hi, Carl.

01:00.660 --> 01:03.185
Is that all you came to say?
Are we done here?

01:03.263 --> 01:05.163
I don't know. I don't think so.

01:05.230 --> 01:07.290
- Then, what?
- What do you mean?

01:07.700 --> 01:09.725
Shoot, I knew I was gonna forget this.

01:09.803 --> 01:12.499
I got a note here.
Someone wrote me a note. Hang on.

01:12.572 --> 01:16.440
This says,
"Start salmon hatchery in Carl's pool".

01:16.509 --> 01:18.204
Okey-dokey. Where are the fish eggs?

01:18.278 --> 01:21.372
- No, get back here!
- Hang on. Here we go.

01:21.815 --> 01:24.477
Wait. That ain't a note. That's a toy.

01:24.717 --> 01:26.150
Here it is.

01:27.787 --> 01:30.347
"Invite Carl to eat Thanksgiving dinner".

01:30.423 --> 01:33.153
Isn't that sweet?
Too bad it was over a week ago.

01:33.226 --> 01:34.853
Don't matter. We're doing it today.

01:34.928 --> 01:37.726
We don't usually celebrate.
We ain't American yet...

01:37.797 --> 01:40.823
till we pass that dumb test.
That test is a bitch.

01:40.900 --> 01:44.199
What you got over there? It smells edible.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.261
It's a traditional Thanksgiving spread.

01:46.339 --> 01:48.739
We got a bunch of tacos
we mushed up with a hammer...

01:48.808 --> 01:51.174
poured crackers on top.
That's called "taco pie".

01:51.244 --> 01:54.179
- What, you got a bird over there?
- Yeah! Bird is the word!

01:54.247 --> 01:58.206
All right! Just give me a sec.
Let me adjust myself.

01:59.285 --> 02:00.411
Yeah.

02:00.887 --> 02:02.411
We got them. Let's go.

02:02.489 --> 02:03.820
Carl is gonna join us, right?

02:03.890 --> 02:06.825
Yep. But he says he'd rather
take his food out on the lawn...

02:06.893 --> 02:08.190
where there are witnesses.

02:08.261 --> 02:10.559
All right. I think we're ready.

02:10.630 --> 02:13.827
Shake? You wanna lead us in a blessing
before you eat?

02:13.900 --> 02:16.528
Or do you wanna just
make a pig out of yourself right now?

02:16.603 --> 02:19.265
I know, but it's a racist holiday.

02:19.339 --> 02:22.172
I stand in line with my Martian brothers...

02:22.242 --> 02:26.338
and celebrate casinoness.
So that we could enjoy the...

02:26.412 --> 02:28.539
Is that whipped?
Hand me that whipped cream!

02:28.615 --> 02:32.517
Fine. I'll do the prayer.
Carl! Bow your head out there!

02:32.585 --> 02:33.779
Toss me a roll!

02:33.853 --> 02:37.619
Lord, we give thanks for this food
we're about to receive, for...

02:37.690 --> 02:40.284
Excuse me. Little help?
Could I have the tacos, please?

02:40.360 --> 02:42.794
- ... this bounty of tacos.
- Could you pass the tacos?

02:42.862 --> 02:45.831
Could you pass me the tacos?

02:45.899 --> 02:47.389
- Here!
- Okay, then.

02:47.467 --> 02:49.833
- This roll is wet!
- Sorry. Please go on.

02:49.903 --> 02:53.532
- For the fellowship we have with our...
- Wait. What's a fellowship?

02:53.606 --> 02:55.005
It's a gay bar down on Ninth!

02:55.074 --> 02:58.441
Aren't you glad we're thanking the Lord
for a nautically themed gay bar?

02:58.511 --> 03:00.741
For the fellowship we have
with our neighbor Carl!

03:00.813 --> 03:02.110
No, do not rope me into this.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.377
The Lord does not need to know
that I'm here.

03:04.450 --> 03:05.781
- Please help us to be...
- Amen!

03:05.852 --> 03:08.377
- Okay, who's gonna whittle this turkey?
- Out of the way!

03:08.454 --> 03:10.979
I will ruin this bird with my anger!

03:11.891 --> 03:15.190
Drop the chain saw if you want him to live.

03:19.966 --> 03:21.661
- I call on the dark meat!
- Shotgun!

03:21.734 --> 03:23.895
Shake, put that damn chain saw down.
Give it here.

03:23.970 --> 03:24.959
But I did call "shotgun".

03:25.038 --> 03:26.369
That's better.

03:26.439 --> 03:28.805
Can we get you
to lower our neighbor now?

03:28.875 --> 03:31.810
- I mean, he didn't do anything to you.
- Yet.

03:32.212 --> 03:35.306
I knew something wasn't normal!
I'm not letting it ride this time!

03:35.381 --> 03:38.407
Freaking robot turkey!
I knew something was up!

03:38.685 --> 03:40.880
- Is he mad?
- No, don't worry about him.

03:40.954 --> 03:43.115
He's always got his butt
trapped around something.

03:43.189 --> 03:45.089
Frylock will want to know
who you're after...

03:45.158 --> 03:47.251
and then he'll say
something like, "Oh, my God! "

03:47.327 --> 03:48.453
He's so predictable!

03:48.528 --> 03:50.655
- Now, who the hell are you?
- I am Turkatron.

03:50.730 --> 03:53.790
I have been sent here from the year 9595...

03:53.866 --> 03:56.562
to save this bird that lies before you.

03:56.636 --> 03:59.628
For he is the great-great-...

03:59.706 --> 04:03.836
great-great-grandfather of Gobblox...

04:04.444 --> 04:09.211
the turkey that's destined to lead
the rebellion against master chickens.

04:10.383 --> 04:13.978
That's fine, we won't eat him,
but, I mean, look at him.

04:14.053 --> 04:15.611
- He's dead.
- He's dead?

04:15.688 --> 04:18.281
He's been in our oven
for three hours at 350 degrees.

04:18.358 --> 04:20.952
- Why, that's impossible!
- Look at him!

04:22.729 --> 04:23.889
He's dead!

04:23.963 --> 04:28.093
Do you know who Gobblox is?
I will tell you who Gobblox is.

04:28.167 --> 04:32.228
<i>In the year 9595,
a race of deformed turkey...</i>

04:32.305 --> 04:34.796
<i>was genetically developed
by chicken scientists...</i>

04:34.874 --> 04:37.570
<i>as revenge against his bird brother.</i>

04:37.644 --> 04:41.171
<i>These turkeys would exit the womb
doused in gravy.</i>

04:41.247 --> 04:44.808
<i>Gravy filled with the giblets
from a monkey.</i>

04:44.884 --> 04:47.819
<i>The French craved it, and as a result...</i>

04:47.887 --> 04:50.981
<i>turkey became
the only food source for France...</i>

04:51.057 --> 04:54.254
<i>which is now called "Robofrance 29".</i>

04:55.261 --> 04:57.627
<i>I was later killed by the chickens!</i>

04:58.965 --> 05:03.061
So, of course, you can see
why I'm angry at those chickens.

05:03.936 --> 05:06.336
You know, you sound very familiar to me.

05:06.406 --> 05:07.634
Of course, I do.

05:07.707 --> 05:10.801
<i>Months and months ago,
I came upon your neighbor...</i>

05:10.877 --> 05:15.678
<i>taking the form of the Cybernetic Ghost
of Christmas Past from the future.</i>

05:15.748 --> 05:20.378
<i>But I didn't realize he was an agent,
a chicken in disguise.</i>

05:20.453 --> 05:23.445
<i>Sent from the year 19...</i>

05:23.523 --> 05:25.616
<i>Sent from the year 19...</i>

05:25.692 --> 05:28.058
-9595?
- From there.

05:28.127 --> 05:30.721
<i>They had evolved big time.</i>

05:30.797 --> 05:33.664
<i>From beyond feathers,
their beaks had softened...</i>

05:33.733 --> 05:37.328
<i>and they had acquired
synthetic intelligence and appendages...</i>

05:37.403 --> 05:40.668
<i>from the chicken black market
from beyond the moon!</i>

05:40.740 --> 05:43.675
Are you serious? Carl? Next-door Carl?

05:43.743 --> 05:47.110
Is a hyper-evolved chicken
from the future?

05:47.580 --> 05:50.606
- What? You are?
- He is. He ain't right!

05:50.683 --> 05:51.809
I knew that.

05:51.884 --> 05:55.513
<i>And that is why
I had to return and erase his mind.</i>

05:55.588 --> 05:57.180
<i>And my mind as well.</i>

05:57.256 --> 06:01.920
<i>I had to be reformulated by
rogue chicken scientists for the rebellion.</i>

06:01.994 --> 06:04.554
<i>They crafted my sleek turkey body...</i>

06:04.630 --> 06:07.656
<i>which allowed for safe passage
through the time rift.</i>

06:07.734 --> 06:09.929
<i>So, in summation...</i>

06:10.370 --> 06:14.101
the bird comes with me. Dead or alive.

06:14.807 --> 06:17.799
You don't have a choice, dude.
He's dead. I told you that.

06:17.877 --> 06:22.644
I must take the bird into the time rift,
to a time before he was cooked.

06:26.285 --> 06:29.083
- All right.
- I'm waiting for the time rift to open.

06:29.155 --> 06:31.555
It could be anywhere at any time.

06:31.624 --> 06:33.785
Okay, you don't mind if we eat, right?

06:33.860 --> 06:36.488
- While you wait?
- Yes, of course. Sure.

06:37.196 --> 06:40.029
Is that a taco pie? Taco pie!

06:40.099 --> 06:42.499
I added food coloring
'cause it's a holiday...

06:42.568 --> 06:45.628
but it turned black,
'cause I added all the food coloring I had.

06:45.705 --> 06:48.902
And I ate this butter straight out of the tub
'cause it tastes good.

06:48.975 --> 06:50.840
There's a reason behind everything.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.037
Enjoy those tacos now.

06:53.112 --> 06:56.206
For, in 1,000 years, they will be illegal.

06:58.117 --> 07:00.312
Think we all know why.

07:00.386 --> 07:01.580
We know why!

07:01.654 --> 07:04.714
Anti-taco legislation.
Disestablishmentarianism.

07:05.958 --> 07:10.258
That's a good story. Why don't you
sit down while you're, you know...

07:11.964 --> 07:13.761
This is pretty good.

07:13.833 --> 07:16.097
I really like the flow if this place.

07:16.169 --> 07:18.228
It screams "party".

07:18.638 --> 07:20.105
You know...

07:20.339 --> 07:24.400
that last bite reminds me
of this severely long story...

07:24.477 --> 07:27.002
<i>about how the chickens
became a master race...</i>

07:27.079 --> 07:29.912
<i>through a freak accident
involving radiation...</i>

07:29.982 --> 07:33.850
<i>and interestingly enough to me,
marshmallow.</i>

07:34.887 --> 07:36.752
Come here!

07:36.823 --> 07:39.348
- Is that the same guy?
- Yeah, I think so. He's crazy!

07:39.425 --> 07:41.893
I think he's really from the year 9595!

07:41.961 --> 07:43.952
- I think so, too.
- Did you hear his story?

07:44.030 --> 07:46.430
- I heard it. And it checks out.
- It is solid.

07:46.499 --> 07:50.265
Yeah, Shake. In the future, they all
carry their belongings in a plastic bag.

07:50.336 --> 07:53.271
That is a future bag.
I say that with all confidence.

07:53.339 --> 07:55.204
These tube socks ought to be washed.

07:55.274 --> 07:58.732
What has he got a bar of soap in here for?
You're a freaking robot!

07:58.811 --> 08:01.041
Excuse me? Those are weapons!

08:01.113 --> 08:05.174
They are all laser-guided,
and I get crazy if you touch them!

08:05.251 --> 08:07.481
Now, where was I? Yes.

08:07.787 --> 08:11.018
It was 100 years
after the tacos were assassinated...

08:11.090 --> 08:13.957
I thought they was illegal.
Was they dead or illegal?

08:14.026 --> 08:17.723
Is this your story now?
Does this happen to you and not to me?

08:17.797 --> 08:21.665
Listen up, everybody!
He's about to tell his amazing story!

08:21.734 --> 08:24.464
The one that happened to me and not him.

08:25.838 --> 08:28.568
- I'm sorry. You got it.
- Are you sure I have it?

08:28.641 --> 08:31.974
Are you sure since it happened to me,
I should be the one to tell it?

08:32.044 --> 08:34.011
Then, yes, I thought I did.

08:36.282 --> 08:39.910
Pass me more wine.
I shall require it to finish.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.280
- Do you want some?
- Not now.

08:47.226 --> 08:49.319
See this thing here.

08:49.629 --> 08:51.756
We had a major run-in...

08:51.831 --> 08:55.961
during the conflict
of Mechanical Advantage 6.

08:56.702 --> 08:59.262
Yeah, just guzzle it down.
Who cares, right?

08:59.338 --> 09:01.670
Damn you, Billy! Damn it!

09:01.741 --> 09:04.767
You thought you had my mind
under your control...

09:04.844 --> 09:07.438
but now who's strapped to a wall...

09:07.513 --> 09:09.947
enslaved by the chickens?

09:10.283 --> 09:14.617
You are strapped to the wall, man!

09:14.687 --> 09:17.155
Wait! Come on! Give me a break, will you?

09:17.223 --> 09:19.350
Down in front, do you mind?

09:19.425 --> 09:23.020
I'm not! And who is now? You are, Dick!

09:23.996 --> 09:25.964
- Is that a time rift?
- The time rift!

09:26.032 --> 09:27.590
Is that a time rift over there?

09:27.667 --> 09:30.261
- No, that's a curtain.
- Move.

09:31.337 --> 09:33.601
- Are you all right?
- Get out of the time rift!

09:33.673 --> 09:35.664
You have no idea where this will send you!

09:35.741 --> 09:39.336
Okay, man, look. You wanna lay down
in the back for a little while...

09:39.412 --> 09:40.970
while you're waiting for your rift?

09:41.047 --> 09:43.607
Yeah, you wanna lie down
because I hit you in the face?

09:44.550 --> 09:45.778
He's out. Hurry.

09:45.851 --> 09:49.218
Fine, I am not spinning.

09:49.288 --> 09:51.153
- Don't touch me!
- You son of a...

09:51.223 --> 09:53.851
Okay, I think that's got it!
Check him for weapons!

09:53.926 --> 09:57.259
These socks here are laser-guided.
Be gentle with those.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.230
And this toothbrush does something, too.

09:59.298 --> 10:01.095
It cleans my teeth!

10:01.167 --> 10:04.534
The chickens
polluted my gums with plaque.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.664
What are you doing? Get out of my mind!

10:07.740 --> 10:08.798
There we go.

10:08.874 --> 10:12.605
Hey, you all! Gobble gobble!
I'm Tom Turkey! Do the hustle!

10:12.678 --> 10:15.442
- Look! Look at this!
- Well, that explains it.

10:15.514 --> 10:17.141
Robot turkey toy recall.

10:17.216 --> 10:20.049
Not that! Down here. The picture. Look.

10:20.119 --> 10:22.314
- What, a pantyhose ad?
- You better believe it!

10:22.388 --> 10:25.687
- It says here they made...
- Give me that. It's mine.

10:26.258 --> 10:28.886
It says here
they made 5,000 of those things.

10:28.961 --> 10:31.259
Seriously? Five thousand of that chick?

10:31.330 --> 10:33.662
No. Five thousand Hustlin' Tom Turkeys!

10:34.700 --> 10:36.099
Oh, no!

10:36.168 --> 10:39.296
- Hello?
- We are here for the...

10:39.372 --> 10:41.499
Next door, people! Right next door!

10:41.574 --> 10:43.371
I'm sorry. Thank you.

10:47.947 --> 10:50.279
You have got to be freaking kidding me.

10:50.349 --> 10:52.112
What are you eating?

10:52.184 --> 10:54.584
This is your great-great-great...

10:57.790 --> 10:58.950
Your mother.
