00:14.720 --> 00:15.559
It's a good job.

00:15.560 --> 00:18.279
You're a police officer!

00:18.280 --> 00:20.799
You're so keen to move on,
I think you should.

00:20.800 --> 00:23.279
Maybe your better class of mates
can put you up.

00:23.280 --> 00:24.639
Some fucker's grassing them up.

00:24.640 --> 00:25.679
What have you done?

00:25.680 --> 00:27.735
He's spied for them,
he can spy for us.

00:27.774 --> 00:29.559
Frank Gallagher, double agent?!

00:29.560 --> 00:32.027
Fuck me. He must be desperate.

Anyone watching, thinking we know
fuck all about knowing fuck all

00:38.360 --> 00:40.919

watch their back! Oooh!

00:40.920 --> 00:44.039
So you've had your Labour,
reclassifying skunk,

00:44.040 --> 00:49.983
sending prices sky-high. Literally
taking the grass from its own roots!

00:50.007 --> 00:52.757

your ConDemNation,

00:56.280 --> 00:59.759
Have we had a national
fucking stroke, or what?

00:59.760 --> 01:03.759
Is revolution a word,
or was it never?

01:04.080 --> 01:07.827
Anybody watching needs to know,
we cope better than average

01:07.866 --> 01:09.671
with irony in Chatsworth.

01:09.702 --> 01:12.882
Well for fuck's sake,
we live in Manchester

01:12.897 --> 01:15.866
and they charge us for water?!

01:16.014 --> 01:20.983
I wandered lonely as a clown,
necking mushrooms rarely found.

01:21.077 --> 01:24.199

Disgraceful.

04:46.320 --> 04:47.159
Not much. Why?

04:47.160 --> 04:49.171

05:14.042 --> 05:15.239
Well, yeah.

Thank you, ladies.
See you next session.

Couldn't get off the rig.
I'll make sure he's up to speed.

05:36.520 --> 05:40.319
Fingers crossed he makes it for
the birth. Has he booked time off?

05:41.084 --> 05:43.409
Not sure. Let me look.

05:45.001 --> 05:49.597
Ah, here it is, filed under
"Mind Your Own Fucking Business".

05:51.560 --> 05:53.823
You're clouding me chakra, man.

05:59.065 --> 06:00.940
It's like The Sopranos, this!

06:01.489 --> 06:06.659
Hanging outside the club, drinking,
talking, cruising the bitches.

06:07.101 --> 06:10.769
What, with our changing bags,
and nappies, extra rice cakes,

06:10.831 --> 06:14.830

Yeah, dead like The Sopranos(!)

06:17.136 --> 06:18.958

flashing before your eyes?

06:19.068 --> 06:23.736
Eh? Look, what happened,
it wasn't your fault.

06:23.800 --> 06:27.799
It fucking was! Totally stole
Kelly off Shane like that.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.839
Bullshit, man,
it goes against the code.

06:29.840 --> 06:33.559
I'm talking about his wife and kids
frying in a fire in Spain, you twat!

06:34.211 --> 06:39.278
Ah! And there is no code.
She's more Mafioso than you!

06:54.560 --> 06:55.599
I won't!

06:55.600 --> 06:57.119
Don't listen to that prick!

06:57.120 --> 07:01.644
If it doesn't involve acne or MILFs,
he's got no experience.

07:01.720 --> 07:03.479
I'm a fucking jinx, all right?

07:03.480 --> 07:06.799
Everything I care about,
everyone I love, get damaged.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.621
There's no such thing as jinxed.

07:08.668 --> 07:12.652
Who's been in my life long-term?
Cum-Bucket!

07:12.759 --> 07:14.363
Look, £10, take it or leave it.

07:14.400 --> 07:15.957
Fucking thief!

07:15.980 --> 07:17.316
Oi!

07:20.040 --> 07:22.319
Guy's going off his nut
cos I won't give him £50

07:22.320 --> 07:24.319
for a two year old portable.

07:24.320 --> 07:27.079
Can't fucking move in there
with shit folk are selling.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.919
I used to think it was "prawn" shop.

07:28.920 --> 07:32.039
I always thought me granddad
was taking his wedding ring

07:32.040 --> 07:33.885
down to the "prawn" shop!

07:36.149 --> 07:39.385
You better have a good reason
for dragging me out of my pit.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.151
Oh, yeah.

07:42.960 --> 07:46.199
Sorry I'm late. Fucking yoga
stresses me out.

07:47.323 --> 07:48.569
Bob upstairs?

07:48.643 --> 07:50.190
Never showed.

07:50.253 --> 07:52.229
Bob? He hasn't missed in... ever.

07:52.268 --> 07:54.679
Had an accident, something to do
with a truck and a Pelican.

07:55.116 --> 07:56.978
Poor bugger!

07:59.440 --> 08:00.879
He's got no-one.

08:00.880 --> 08:01.862
Mmm.

08:02.151 --> 08:04.879
He was a gentleman, you know.
Always asked after me.

08:04.880 --> 08:06.279
"How are we today, Kelly?"

08:06.280 --> 08:08.319
And he'd actually wait
for an answer.

08:08.648 --> 08:10.620
Then you'd toss him off.

08:11.360 --> 08:12.776
I'm going to go see him.

08:12.815 --> 08:15.079
Hospital's no place for you
in your condition!

08:15.080 --> 08:16.519
You might catch something.

08:16.520 --> 08:17.799
Maybe it's the hormones.

08:17.800 --> 08:20.519
Fuck knows, I could bottle
and sell them at the minute,

08:20.770 --> 08:22.166
but I'm going in.

08:26.560 --> 08:27.892
You missed a bit.

08:33.440 --> 08:34.744
Bastard!

08:34.791 --> 08:37.558
Fucking blood,
I've just scratched myself now!

08:37.559 --> 08:40.719
We're not robbing cars!
We'll never shift them!

08:40.720 --> 08:44.719
It's not the cars we're after.
Watch and learn.

08:47.840 --> 08:50.159
Stop fucking hitting me!
I'm 26-years-old!

08:50.160 --> 08:52.142
Fucking explain yourself!

08:55.330 --> 08:57.919
All those fuckers that are evicting
people from the estate, yeah,

08:57.920 --> 09:01.919
the Gestapo, they've got to leave
their motors somewhere, don't they?

09:02.560 --> 09:07.080
Can't bring them to the Chatsworth,
there's thieves knocking about.

09:13.880 --> 09:17.079
It's not about the cars,
it's about the booty in the boot.

09:17.080 --> 09:19.999
Have you seen the gear
that that lot carry?

09:20.000 --> 09:23.319
Phones, laptops, tablets, scanners.
Got to keep it somewhere.

09:23.320 --> 09:25.039
So you're taking pictures of it?

09:25.040 --> 09:27.599
If I wanted to connect my printer
to my computer,

09:27.600 --> 09:30.079
how do I do it if I don't want
wires everywhere?

09:30.080 --> 09:34.079
You know I don't believe in
computers, don't you?

09:37.040 --> 09:39.879
Bluetooth!
It detects another wireless device

09:39.880 --> 09:42.439
and asks you if you
want to make a connection.

09:42.440 --> 09:45.359
To which you reply?

09:45.360 --> 09:47.596
You clever bastard!

09:49.490 --> 09:53.489
ALARM PEALS

10:17.734 --> 10:20.080
Mortgage or not...

10:21.200 --> 10:23.759
Job or no job...

10:24.189 --> 10:26.853
I will always be with you.

10:28.184 --> 10:32.183
This makes you a very lucky man,
because I am a catch.

10:32.868 --> 10:35.552
Say "Thank you, Avril".

10:36.040 --> 10:37.039
I wanted more.

10:37.672 --> 10:39.270
I didn't.

10:39.440 --> 10:42.239
The whole world is fucked up
because people want more.

10:42.942 --> 10:45.521
I want us, 'Tish.

10:46.014 --> 10:48.326
Everything else is just...

10:49.284 --> 10:50.622
stuff.

10:59.240 --> 11:02.466
There are people round here
far worse off than us.

11:03.640 --> 11:05.763
You can say that again.

11:16.939 --> 11:18.058
What are you doing?

11:18.130 --> 11:21.449
Evicted. We've been living
under here three days.

11:21.746 --> 11:25.118
Listen to your missus, mate.
She talks sense.

11:44.584 --> 11:47.820
Want one? Pig in a blanket? (SNORTS)

11:51.244 --> 11:53.039
Unacceptable!

11:53.040 --> 11:55.519
Oh, yeah? Didn't takeyoulong
to revert to type.

11:55.520 --> 11:59.919
I am still the same lad.
I am Carl fucking Gallagher,

11:59.960 --> 12:01.399
except now I've got a job.

12:01.400 --> 12:04.079
It's not a job...
it's a Faustian deal.

12:04.080 --> 12:06.000
You sold your soul to
Beelzebub, you fucking

12:06.001 --> 12:07.919
muppet, and you
don't even know it!

12:07.920 --> 12:11.319
Oh, yeah... what, cos of your father
or your grandfather,

12:11.320 --> 12:14.079
or some fucking Irish bloke
we knew 200 years ago.

12:14.080 --> 12:16.239
They're as much my blood
as they are yours.

12:16.240 --> 12:20.239
Cos you come from here.
Have some dignity, change your name.

12:20.697 --> 12:24.176
Fuck the past!
Katie, Stella, little Cilla...

12:24.191 --> 12:25.519
that's why I'm doing it,

12:25.520 --> 12:28.719
to make this place less of
a shit-hole for them to grow up in.

12:28.720 --> 12:30.719
They've sucked out your soul.

12:31.360 --> 12:32.599
Bollocks.

12:32.647 --> 12:34.916
Well, prove it, then.

12:36.153 --> 12:37.697
Yeah, go on.

12:39.513 --> 12:41.009
Yeah, thought so.

12:50.136 --> 12:55.541
(SLURRED) We were brought up...
to be suspicious of the police.

12:56.080 --> 13:00.665
The oppressive arm of the state,
charging demonstrators on horseback,

13:00.720 --> 13:02.399
and all that.

13:02.837 --> 13:06.430
They got my motor back once, after
some little Welsh prick robbed it.

13:06.461 --> 13:10.239
Me grandad was in Cork.
You know... Black and Tans.

13:10.240 --> 13:13.618
We can't have a Gallagher
in the police.

13:13.657 --> 13:14.879
It's a good pension.

13:14.880 --> 13:17.985
I mean, he's a bright lad.
Not academic bright, mind...

13:18.367 --> 13:20.942
he takes after his mother in that
respect but he can turn his hand to...

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
And he's a looker.

13:24.844 --> 13:28.438
What? I always thought it looked
like he'd got his finger in a socket

13:28.445 --> 13:29.884
or something, you know?

13:29.947 --> 13:32.177
No. The teens, the
MILFS, the GILFS...

13:32.178 --> 13:34.407
they'd all ride him,
given half the chance.

13:35.469 --> 13:37.479
What the fuck is wrong with you?!

13:37.878 --> 13:40.517
Was in here last night,
had one too many.

13:40.986 --> 13:43.055
Someone fingered me in the snug.

13:45.040 --> 13:47.060
Well, it wasn't me.

13:48.943 --> 13:50.716
You can smell if you want.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.639
I'll need reimbursing.

13:55.640 --> 13:58.959
After all the business he's given you
over the years?

13:58.960 --> 14:01.119
True. He was a lovely customer.

14:01.120 --> 14:03.880
Isa lovely customer.
He's not dead yet.

14:05.980 --> 14:07.997
He knowsyou'rehere.

14:09.941 --> 14:13.940
Every time I saw him lately, I kept
complaining about my feet killing me.

14:13.960 --> 14:15.159
Used to give me a foot massage.

14:15.160 --> 14:17.199
Had a thing about feet, didn't he?

14:17.200 --> 14:21.199
He had a briefcase
full of all kinds of books on feet.

14:21.840 --> 14:23.279
He's a chiropodist.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.311
Wouldn't put it past him.

14:25.800 --> 14:28.756
Back to work, soon as.
Profit in that bump.

14:54.760 --> 14:57.311
For old time's sake, eh, pal?

15:14.960 --> 15:16.679
Do I look like a man
with 100 quid to spare?

15:16.680 --> 15:19.999
It's quality gear, that...
shifted the other two already.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.320
You could ask Jonesy.
Oh no, he won't be able to

15:22.321 --> 15:24.319
take it, on account he's
got no house to live in.

15:25.974 --> 15:27.546
How much?

15:31.583 --> 15:33.052
That's all I've got.

15:35.278 --> 15:37.147
How do you sleep at night?

15:37.797 --> 15:39.846
(WHISTLES)

15:45.136 --> 15:48.458
Right, I don't care who did it.
I even admire your cheek a little,

15:48.765 --> 15:51.966
but... I want my computer back.

15:52.799 --> 15:55.599
It's not a work computer,
it's my personal property,

15:55.640 --> 15:58.327
material of sentimental value.

15:58.328 --> 16:01.013
Pictures of my children,
Christmas, birthdays, holidays.

16:01.313 --> 16:05.312
Things I can't replicate or replace.
And I stupidly have no back-up.

16:06.040 --> 16:08.628
I'm sorry you've
lost your mementos.

16:08.629 --> 16:11.216
Thanks to you, these people
have lost their homes.

16:12.336 --> 16:14.068
They've still got photographs.

16:14.518 --> 16:17.208
They just don't have anywhere
to put them.

16:17.935 --> 16:21.324
This is a step too far. Personal
items are not part of the game.

16:21.380 --> 16:22.699
The game?!

16:22.779 --> 16:25.039
Yeah, the fucking game.

16:25.657 --> 16:28.411
You people... think you're so clever.

16:28.560 --> 16:32.146
What you do
is not a victimless crime.

16:32.193 --> 16:34.559
You're a mad cow.

16:34.560 --> 16:37.935
All your cheating and scamming
and benefit fraud...

16:38.019 --> 16:39.943
- Good people, like me...
- And me.

16:39.982 --> 16:42.411
Have our lives impacted upon

16:42.443 --> 16:45.479
by your scavenging lives.
We bear the cost.

16:45.600 --> 16:50.342
No, you fucking don't. What you mean is,
the rules are rigged in your favour.

16:50.360 --> 16:52.479
Everything's rigged in your favour,

16:52.480 --> 16:57.279
and the moment one of us bite back,
you kick and scratch and scream,

16:57.320 --> 17:00.068
"I want mine! What about mine?!"

17:00.123 --> 17:01.811
That's my man.

17:01.834 --> 17:03.159
Look, come on, Miss...

17:03.160 --> 17:05.638
Fuck off, you leech!
Leave me alone.

17:05.640 --> 17:07.394
Upset by a couple of evictions, are you?

17:07.441 --> 17:08.519
Yeah.

17:08.520 --> 17:11.464
(IN AMERICAN ACCENT)
Getting all "Spartacus" on my ass?

17:11.488 --> 17:15.358
Progress is coming, like it or not.
Five years from now, maybe seven,

17:15.976 --> 17:19.974
this place won't even be here.
None of you will be here.

17:20.402 --> 17:24.839
The rest of society are not funding
the underbelly any more.

17:24.901 --> 17:30.707
We're not doing it. So it won't be
30 evictions, or 40, or even 100.

17:31.337 --> 17:35.199
Ten years from now,
this place will be wasteland!

17:36.760 --> 17:38.639
And that's not opinion...

17:38.640 --> 17:40.479
that's policy.

17:40.480 --> 17:42.629
(MAN) Go on, fuck off!

17:57.000 --> 18:00.839
If I'd wanted misery,
I could have stayed at home.

18:00.840 --> 18:03.319
What sort of shop
are you running here anyway?

18:03.320 --> 18:05.159
This place is fucked.

18:05.160 --> 18:08.279
It's always been fucked...
it's a vital part of its appeal.

18:08.280 --> 18:11.319
People don't know what the future
holds... they're upset.

18:11.320 --> 18:13.559
The future
is what you fucking make it!

18:13.560 --> 18:16.629
Come on, where's the spirit of '68?

18:19.940 --> 18:24.832
Oh, what the fuck?! Student riots?
Paris? Prague Spring?

18:24.864 --> 18:26.863
Tune in, drop out,

18:26.927 --> 18:29.300
shag a skank because she'll let you?

18:29.613 --> 18:32.519
Civil... disobedience.

18:33.542 --> 18:35.542
Huh? You don't have
to play by their

18:35.543 --> 18:37.541
fucking rules... make
some up of your own.

18:37.613 --> 18:39.246
Seize the fucking day.

18:39.269 --> 18:42.799
It's like the French,
but they blockade the motorways.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.919
And burn sheep. They do.

18:44.920 --> 18:49.723
Thank you. You have to admire
the Gauls for their gall,

18:50.263 --> 18:54.262
despite their cheese-eating
surrender-monkey tendencies.

18:54.320 --> 18:55.639
What more can we do?

18:55.640 --> 18:57.559
Why does it matter to you anyway?

18:57.560 --> 19:00.639
Because all this misery

19:00.640 --> 19:04.639
is ruining my fucking pint.

19:08.108 --> 19:11.947
I'm hanging up my crotchless
when this little bundle drops.

19:12.409 --> 19:14.918
Can't have your mam on the game,
can you?

19:19.960 --> 19:22.880
I've got to be responsible. I mean...

19:26.219 --> 19:30.218
If me and Marty go tits up like me
and Shane... cos these things happen...

19:30.866 --> 19:33.255
it'll just be me and a kid.

19:40.046 --> 19:41.405
I want this...

19:42.515 --> 19:44.732
more than I've ever wanted anything,
Bob.

19:44.760 --> 19:46.919
The fella, the kid, flat,

19:47.271 --> 19:50.341
nice little job where
I don't have to wear a gum-shield.

19:55.379 --> 19:57.346
I want the dream.

19:59.547 --> 20:01.853
Reckon him upstairs
will let me have it?

20:01.911 --> 20:03.369
Have what?

20:05.876 --> 20:07.546
Sorry. Who are you?

20:08.232 --> 20:11.609
His wife. Who are you?

20:16.042 --> 20:17.851
Ta.

20:18.356 --> 20:22.355
Not a typical hospital visitor,
if you don't mind me saying so.

20:23.666 --> 20:25.985
I'm just aware
that some folk don't have anyone.

20:26.111 --> 20:29.039
I mean,
I had no idea Bob were married.

20:29.120 --> 20:30.279
You missed his wedding ring?

20:30.280 --> 20:32.511
He never wore it.

20:32.520 --> 20:35.399
Sorry, my dad never wore
a wedding ring.

20:36.220 --> 20:38.640
I just don't even think to look.

20:44.515 --> 20:47.827
That must've been a real shock.
I'm sorry.

20:48.960 --> 20:51.759
The doctor said I should
prepare myself for the worst.

20:52.408 --> 20:55.788
The damage to his brain's extensive,
and if he did make a recovery...

20:56.480 --> 20:59.639
Look, you don't know what'll happen,
nor do the doctors,

20:59.640 --> 21:02.913
they're just giving you
a worst-case scenario.

21:10.820 --> 21:12.902
Have a look in "My Photos".
You know she'll

21:12.903 --> 21:14.983
have some homemade porn
on there, don't you?

21:15.240 --> 21:16.839
She's a businesswoman.

21:16.840 --> 21:20.511
She is filth, I can tell, mate.
"This place will be wasteland!"

21:20.558 --> 21:22.599
I almost come in me pants!

21:22.600 --> 21:24.520
Hey, we could stick up a
couple of barricades,

21:24.521 --> 21:26.439
block the roads, like
Derry in the old days.

21:26.440 --> 21:29.799
Oh, that's all we need...
rubber bullets and petrol bombs.

21:29.800 --> 21:32.275
Could enlist Marty Fisher,
he burns stuff.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.685
Oh, that's opening
a can of worms.

21:34.686 --> 21:37.079
He's imbalanced, he
wouldn't know when tostop.

21:37.080 --> 21:39.719
That's what Kelly says!

21:39.720 --> 21:41.039
Sorry.

21:41.040 --> 21:43.479
Maybe we take the fight toher.

21:43.480 --> 21:46.479
Why is the Chatsworth the
battleground? Take it to hergaff.

21:46.480 --> 21:48.719
It's nice, hergaff. She tried
to seduce me there, you know.

21:48.720 --> 21:49.999
(MIMI) Ha!

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
She's got a meeting
tomorrow at her hotel.

21:52.001 --> 21:53.999
Council, Work and Pensions,
they're all coming.

21:54.040 --> 21:56.719
Dress the girl up as a chambermaid,
bug the room.

21:56.720 --> 21:58.416
I'd look brilliant
as a chambermaid.

21:58.431 --> 22:01.919
Good idea, Jason Bourne! Should I
get my bag of listening devices?

22:01.920 --> 22:04.736
I resisted, if anyone's interested.

22:05.160 --> 22:07.479
I think
she craves the furry chalice.

22:07.480 --> 22:09.517
Oh, fuck me,
I would pay to see that.

22:09.549 --> 22:11.159
We won't need to bug the room.

22:11.160 --> 22:12.239
How so?

22:12.240 --> 22:13.377
You'll see.

22:15.322 --> 22:16.919
Right, everyone, this is Jodie.

22:17.443 --> 22:20.174
She's got a rather unique talent.

22:20.200 --> 22:22.642
If you can just stand aside.

22:26.036 --> 22:29.658
The old one is saying, "Dress you up
like a chambermaid at my place,

22:29.792 --> 22:32.014
"we could charge a ton an hour.

22:32.015 --> 22:34.236
" The young one says, "I will
have tuition fees to pay."

22:34.440 --> 22:35.723
What the fuck?!

22:35.762 --> 22:37.067
She can read minds?!

22:37.084 --> 22:41.301
Lips, dickhead! She lip-reads. Jodie
is going to be our secret weapon.

22:41.979 --> 22:43.301
Well done.

22:52.595 --> 22:54.293
(LAUGHS)

22:55.600 --> 22:59.599
DISTANT PLAYGROUND NOISES

22:59.893 --> 23:02.857
♪ You stepped out of a cloud

23:04.660 --> 23:08.659
♪ I want to take you away

23:09.247 --> 23:13.246
♪ Away from the crowd... ♪

23:13.421 --> 23:15.279
I don't understand.

23:16.012 --> 23:17.842
This can't be happening.

23:19.632 --> 23:22.991
♪ Alone and apart

23:23.616 --> 23:25.889
♪ Out of a dream... ♪

23:27.641 --> 23:30.647
Breaking and entering,
damage to property.

23:30.706 --> 23:33.178
You said yourselves yesterday,
we make the rules.

23:33.239 --> 23:36.478
Every time you break them,
you're giving us more ammunition.

23:36.566 --> 23:38.764
You're damaging yourselves.

23:38.801 --> 23:40.200
That's clever.

23:40.482 --> 23:43.121
We'll just evict all over again,
only this time,

23:43.169 --> 23:46.459
the penalties will be stiffer.
Custodial.

23:46.655 --> 23:48.454
But no-one's back in the same house.

23:49.260 --> 23:50.299
What?

23:51.322 --> 23:53.326
No-one's returned
to the same properties.

23:53.372 --> 23:55.154
All have got new occupants.

23:55.313 --> 23:59.623
So, your info, work and pensions,
Inland Revenue, council tax.

23:59.702 --> 24:00.781
Immigration.

24:00.867 --> 24:02.226
Useless.

24:02.321 --> 24:05.537
You don't know who's who,
or where.

24:06.065 --> 24:08.889
You don't seriously think
this will stop it?

24:09.076 --> 24:10.865
(LAUGHS) Yeah.

24:13.612 --> 24:15.709
I seriously do.

24:15.812 --> 24:17.404
(LAUGHS)

24:21.975 --> 24:23.254
We're so screwed.

24:24.115 --> 24:27.092
They'll be back. Only next time,
they'll hit twice as hard.

24:27.166 --> 24:30.022
Dogs, PSCs, alarm systems

24:30.062 --> 24:31.897
and custody for anyone
who doesn't comply.

24:32.203 --> 24:33.562
I love my job.

24:34.642 --> 24:37.147
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

24:38.990 --> 24:41.778
Two, three, four

24:41.842 --> 24:43.670
and out. Arrows of light!

24:43.801 --> 24:48.186
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, haaah!

24:48.209 --> 24:49.522
Camel toe!

24:49.545 --> 24:50.664
Bless you!

24:50.751 --> 24:52.190
What's wi' twitches?

24:52.854 --> 24:54.928
You know I still get it with you,
when I've got the horn.

24:55.585 --> 24:56.864
You've got the horn?

24:56.939 --> 24:58.240
Yeah.

24:59.046 --> 25:02.272
Fucking brilliant.
Now I've got the horn!

25:05.373 --> 25:08.412
Great. OK, up we get, mums.
Thank you very much.

25:11.873 --> 25:14.779
This is better than being
on a rig off Aberdeen, eh?

25:15.479 --> 25:16.678
What?

25:16.796 --> 25:18.607
Have you booked time off
for the birth?

25:18.640 --> 25:20.811
Oi! "One-Born-Every-Minute."
Back off.

25:21.031 --> 25:25.178
No, it's all right. How can I be
negative about this? We'll be good.

25:25.835 --> 25:27.914
THEY GRUNT

25:28.577 --> 25:31.037
You'll have to excuse us,
but you know what hormones are like.

25:31.118 --> 25:33.287
I really need to go ride my boy.

25:34.262 --> 25:36.522
Have you had any thoughts
on breast-feeding?

25:37.141 --> 25:38.639
Unleash the beast.

25:38.698 --> 25:43.326
Tit wank, nipple rash, areola!
Udders, puppies, milky mountains!

25:46.754 --> 25:48.169
Tell me again!

25:48.218 --> 25:50.951
I want our baby!
I love our baby.

25:51.083 --> 25:53.725
Oh, baby!

25:55.250 --> 25:58.936
The welfare state is over.
Housing, health, education.

25:58.950 --> 26:01.829
It just got bloated
and unaffordable.

26:01.916 --> 26:05.100
It's a direct consequence
of everyone living longer.

26:05.312 --> 26:09.311
Blah, blah, blah. That's what you
sound like to me, do you know that?

26:09.357 --> 26:11.725
We can beat them.
We're better than them.

26:11.781 --> 26:14.660
It's not about them and us.

26:14.692 --> 26:16.389
We're no fucking different.

26:16.424 --> 26:19.437
What, you think they don't love
their kids as much as we love ours?

26:20.373 --> 26:26.858
I have rejected 20 calls today, from
my estranged, alcoholic husband,

26:26.880 --> 26:31.366
who presently is fucking a girl
barely scraping legality.

26:32.282 --> 26:36.562
And yet, at some point,
at some point,

26:37.703 --> 26:39.702
I will let him come back...

26:40.528 --> 26:43.527
and rip the heart out of me again
and pay for the privilege.

26:43.559 --> 26:45.991
How is that better?

26:46.531 --> 26:48.335
My husband wets the bed.

26:50.319 --> 26:54.118
Look, it's about the system,
and getting it to work for YOU.

26:54.174 --> 26:55.693
That's all that counts.

26:55.811 --> 26:58.132
It's time to grow some balls,
Feeney.

26:59.923 --> 27:02.042
You don't sound like yourself.

27:02.855 --> 27:04.854
Be very clear...

27:05.199 --> 27:07.710
There are no lengths
I won't go to.

27:10.127 --> 27:12.382
What, you think I'm going to let
10 lazy bastards

27:12.427 --> 27:14.210
keep me from my salary?

27:20.328 --> 27:23.569
Well, that's all right. You're
the middle of the sandwich...

27:23.647 --> 27:26.766
I want one up there...

27:27.360 --> 27:28.879
I might have fucking known.

27:28.880 --> 27:31.199
I was tricked down here,
all right?

27:31.200 --> 27:33.039
She said she'd give me a blow...

27:33.040 --> 27:34.959
Only to lure him in.

27:34.960 --> 27:38.759
I tried the trail of bread crumbs,
but he didn't pick up on it.

27:38.760 --> 27:41.538
Right, that door stays locked
until you sort it out.

27:42.560 --> 27:44.866
Any stock he drinks, you pay for it.

27:47.600 --> 27:50.519
Shouldn't have to prove myself.
You're my dad.

27:50.520 --> 27:53.999
Hundred million sperm, and me best
swimmer turns out to be a Judas.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.635
What are the chances?

27:57.853 --> 27:59.393
When are you due?

28:00.380 --> 28:02.502
I'm five months gone.

28:03.457 --> 28:05.033
Your first?

28:05.877 --> 28:08.677
We only had the one. Unplanned.

28:08.726 --> 28:11.143
This one took me
a little bit by surprise.

28:11.723 --> 28:12.762
Scared?

28:13.240 --> 28:14.799
I'm fuckin' terrified.

28:14.800 --> 28:16.199
You'll be a great mum.

28:16.200 --> 28:18.639
Look at the kindness
you've shown me.

28:18.640 --> 28:21.439
Look at how you care for Bob,
someone you don't even know.

28:22.120 --> 28:24.034
I think you're remarkable.

28:31.904 --> 28:34.343
I love a man who's in touch
with his feminine side.

28:34.416 --> 28:36.159
Got your moisturiser
on my forehead too.

28:36.160 --> 28:37.736
The Christmas present,
or the good one?

28:37.746 --> 28:39.145
Green bottle.

28:40.400 --> 28:41.866
Can't read any more of this.

28:42.205 --> 28:45.393
It's all spreadsheets
and proposals. Going snow-blind.

28:45.416 --> 28:46.697
You did good.

28:46.710 --> 28:48.565
I won't let it go to my head.

28:51.362 --> 28:52.841
Have you seen this?

28:52.920 --> 28:56.719
Her contract is on here.
It's totally gold-plated.

28:56.720 --> 28:58.719
We've got to get this to Karen
and Jamie.

28:58.720 --> 29:00.439
Here's the interesting stuff.

29:00.440 --> 29:03.359
Her contract of employment.
Terms and conditions.

29:03.360 --> 29:06.719
150 grand? What, that's her salary?

29:06.720 --> 29:10.719
That's her bonus, if she manages
to permanently board up 120 houses.

29:10.763 --> 29:12.042
That's horrible.

29:12.059 --> 29:13.783
You can see why she'd be
pissed off at us.

29:14.260 --> 29:16.119
Is it wrong, right?

29:16.120 --> 29:20.119
That she gives me a full-on stiffy
every single time I see her?

29:21.560 --> 29:23.439
D'you mind if I ask you a question?

29:24.237 --> 29:25.956
How do you do it?

29:26.284 --> 29:29.276
I mean, the whole wife thing?

29:30.120 --> 29:32.599
All those years
and you're still in love.

29:33.021 --> 29:35.440
We haven't been in love
in a long time.

29:35.840 --> 29:39.239
We've been married 45 years.
People change.

29:39.240 --> 29:40.519
But you change together.

29:40.684 --> 29:42.330
The love we have now is...

29:43.599 --> 29:45.627
It's nothing like the love
we used to have.

29:45.640 --> 29:47.039
That's normal, isn't it?

29:47.837 --> 29:49.276
I suppose.

29:49.424 --> 29:52.088
Bob was never the most
physical of men.

29:52.100 --> 29:53.377
He never...

29:54.440 --> 29:56.239
He wasn't a sexual man.

29:56.396 --> 29:57.736
Eh?

29:59.144 --> 30:01.729
I know it must seem odd
to a woman of your age,

30:01.856 --> 30:04.572
but, I need that attention.
The satisfaction.

30:04.595 --> 30:08.594
So, I looked for it and I found it
with other men, other lovers.

30:10.942 --> 30:13.283
Truth be told,
I'm very much in love with someone.

30:14.077 --> 30:16.572
I was going to tell Bob,
but then this happened.

30:17.166 --> 30:18.599
You were leaving him?

30:18.600 --> 30:21.268
He's an old man. Inside
as well as out.

30:21.799 --> 30:23.799
Maybe you weren't trying
hard enough.

30:24.056 --> 30:25.495
Excuse me?

30:26.207 --> 30:28.815
Never had any trouble
when he were with me.

30:30.960 --> 30:32.879
Worked out well for you, hasn't it?

30:32.880 --> 30:34.838
Bit of luck, he'll pop his clogs
and you won't have to tell him.

30:34.880 --> 30:36.679
What do you mean, "with you"?

30:36.745 --> 30:40.424
I'm a prostitute, love. A hooker,
lady of the night, Irma la Douce.

30:41.298 --> 30:43.138
Bob was one of my regulars.

30:43.139 --> 30:44.977
Probably saw me when you
were at your lover's.

30:45.346 --> 30:47.018
You slut.

30:48.893 --> 30:50.039
You're no better.

30:50.040 --> 30:51.611
Get out!

30:53.559 --> 30:55.118
No, Hannah, stop it!

30:55.157 --> 30:56.785
Get off me!

33:35.330 --> 33:38.439
I will not be intimidated.

33:38.760 --> 33:41.199
I'm not trying to intimidate you.

33:52.651 --> 33:55.986

33:56.888 --> 33:59.017
You don't have to be like this.

33:59.520 --> 34:00.959
Don't be scared.

34:01.881 --> 34:03.509
It's not that messy...

34:03.961 --> 34:06.689
once all the blood
drains from your corpse.

34:07.067 --> 34:09.080
The only question remaining for you,

34:09.393 --> 34:12.931
is do you want to pass up
this, literally,

34:14.159 --> 34:16.431
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

34:18.375 --> 34:21.306
and deliver me a blow-job,
before it's too late?

34:21.630 --> 34:23.033
DNA, Shane!

34:23.804 --> 34:26.572
Fuck off! I was just asking.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.039
It's like the old days round here...

34:34.040 --> 34:36.839
one in the bathroom,
two in the dungeon. Grub's up!

34:36.840 --> 34:38.359
(FRANK) About fucking time.

34:38.360 --> 34:41.639
Of course, the kidnapee upstairs
is worth a few bob.

34:41.639 --> 34:44.639
150 grand bonus for kicking
people out their houses?

34:44.639 --> 34:46.239
Horrific, that.

34:46.239 --> 34:48.079
It's the poetry of the free market.

34:48.080 --> 34:49.679
Shut up.

34:49.679 --> 34:51.279
Insured up to the hilt, as well.

34:51.280 --> 34:54.918
She so much as trips over a stiletto
and she's minted for life.

34:54.920 --> 34:56.039
Can't lose for winning.

34:56.040 --> 34:57.559
See what your lot are about?

34:57.560 --> 34:58.639
My lot?

34:58.640 --> 35:00.999
These are the ranks you've joined.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.425
You are DIRECTLY responsible
for the death of this community.

35:04.468 --> 35:06.408
It's not fucking funny, it's tragic.

35:06.640 --> 35:08.279
You miserable arsehole.

35:08.280 --> 35:11.319
This community'll never die.
Look how they're fighting back.

35:11.320 --> 35:13.320
Kicked out their homes and
still refusing to lie

35:13.321 --> 35:15.319
down, no matter what that
blonde bint does to them.

35:15.406 --> 35:17.442
You are still spreading her gospel.

35:17.480 --> 35:20.759
If you clobbered her over
the head for the insurance,

35:20.760 --> 35:21.839
she'd be delighted.

35:21.840 --> 35:23.039
What fucking side are you on?

35:23.040 --> 35:24.759
I'm on my own side.

35:24.760 --> 35:26.359
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

35:26.665 --> 35:29.133
Shut up, yeah?
Shut up... thought forming.

35:29.434 --> 35:33.766
Carl, Carl, Carl, Carl, Carl, Carl.

35:33.813 --> 35:36.479
- Are you in there, son?
- What?

35:36.480 --> 35:37.916
My boy.

35:40.480 --> 35:44.479
That is the best idea I have ever...

35:44.480 --> 35:45.479
What is?

35:45.480 --> 35:48.399
Do her in for the insurance money.

35:48.400 --> 35:52.986
Let her take her black,
black soul off somewhere else.

35:53.002 --> 35:54.161
I never said that.

35:54.186 --> 35:58.728
Yes, you fucking did
and I have never been prouder.

35:59.544 --> 36:04.111
Under those layers
and layers of piggery,

36:05.480 --> 36:08.869
a Gallagher heart still beats.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.679
No. Under no circumstances.

36:17.680 --> 36:20.239
You're covered by
a gold-plated insurance scheme

36:20.240 --> 36:22.079
while on Agency business.

36:22.080 --> 36:24.119
Absolutely not.

36:24.120 --> 36:26.119
You'd get a six figure pay out.

36:26.120 --> 36:27.812
That doesn't make it
any more palatable.

36:27.859 --> 36:30.898
It's the "injured" bit
that leaves me cold.

36:31.419 --> 36:35.418
You will NOT empty this place.
People won't just lie down.

36:35.920 --> 36:39.117
We can arrange for you to be hurt.
In a controlled manner.

36:39.465 --> 36:42.828
And in return, you erase
all databases, spreadsheets,

36:42.880 --> 36:45.079
original copies...
mainframe and backup,

36:45.494 --> 36:47.625
on every person on
the Chatsworth Estate.

36:48.062 --> 36:49.759
You're not asking for much, are you?

36:50.010 --> 36:51.289
Can you do it?

36:51.987 --> 36:53.621
Yeah, it only takes a password.

36:53.698 --> 36:57.761
I have remote access to all
the systems, I can delete them.

36:57.870 --> 37:00.073
Permanently? Including backup?

37:00.113 --> 37:02.761
Permanently and irrevocably...
if I have a mind to.

37:03.261 --> 37:04.919
Which I don't.

37:05.854 --> 37:07.698
Why are you so nasty?

37:08.191 --> 37:11.079
I'm not nasty, I'm focused.

37:11.720 --> 37:13.999
I think a woman needs to be.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.042
Excuse me.

37:16.968 --> 37:20.447
I have to visit
the little boy's room.

37:20.972 --> 37:22.331
How old are you?

37:22.784 --> 37:24.894
40? 45?

37:24.948 --> 37:28.948
Fuck off. Scrape the cement away,
that one'll never see 50 again.

37:28.974 --> 37:30.533
Your point being?

37:30.575 --> 37:33.334
Is this how you want
to spend the next two years?

37:33.827 --> 37:36.906
Are you really that committed
on getting one over on us?

37:36.964 --> 37:40.199
But she's not committed,
though, are you?

37:40.840 --> 37:43.511
It's not political.
It's not an agenda.

37:44.154 --> 37:46.941
It's about being strong,
being in control.

37:52.696 --> 37:54.589
I bet your husband's a right prick.

37:54.967 --> 37:56.253
(LAUGHS)

37:57.638 --> 37:59.277
You don't hide it well.

37:59.466 --> 38:03.465
I believe in what I'm doing.
It's necessary.

38:15.112 --> 38:19.456
But I'm so sick of
all this unpleasantness.

38:20.318 --> 38:22.878
I am. I'm so tired.

38:24.285 --> 38:25.550
I'm exhausted.

38:30.200 --> 38:33.003
What safeguards would I have?

38:35.220 --> 38:37.855
Trust us, violence is our thing.

38:43.128 --> 38:45.079
Do you need me to get you a nurse?

38:45.353 --> 38:47.800
You should be due some pain killers.

38:48.360 --> 38:49.519
How's Bob?

38:50.183 --> 38:51.422
Same.

38:51.502 --> 38:55.511
I'm sorry. The baby, you...
I told you I was jinxed.

38:55.550 --> 38:56.319
I don't need this.

38:56.320 --> 38:58.679
Everything I touch turns to shit.
Everything.

38:58.680 --> 39:01.472
I don't have the strength
for this to be about you, Marty.

39:10.320 --> 39:12.042
Can't leave Bob on his own.

39:12.081 --> 39:14.292
Will you forget about fucking Bob?

39:14.949 --> 39:16.487
He has no-one...

39:18.206 --> 39:21.319
and he could be stuck
inside that injury for years.

39:21.320 --> 39:23.527
I'll take care of Bob... worry not.

39:23.880 --> 39:27.214
You take care of her
or you've got me to answer to.

39:31.148 --> 39:32.588
I'm sorry.

39:37.769 --> 39:38.940
KNOCKING ON DOOR

39:39.560 --> 39:41.315
Private meeting... fuck off!

39:41.386 --> 39:44.409
Take one each and
don't let anyone else see it.

39:45.416 --> 39:47.819
Everyone's volunteered,
but only one of us can do the deed.

39:47.846 --> 39:49.330
"There can be only one."

39:49.409 --> 39:50.439
Behave.

39:50.440 --> 39:53.639
If anyone gets fingered,
they'll be looking at a long stretch.

39:53.640 --> 39:55.879
Assault on someone

39:55.880 --> 39:59.239
What the fuck?
Am I holding the coats, or what?

39:59.240 --> 40:02.959
She knows you. We don't want her
to be able to ID the attackers.

40:02.960 --> 40:04.719
You're hardly inconspicuous.

40:04.720 --> 40:06.319
GASPING

40:06.320 --> 40:09.999
Firstly, Enoch, we're not
the only blacks in the village.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.679
Secondly...

40:11.680 --> 40:13.159
(GROANS)

40:13.160 --> 40:15.999
Besides, Dad,
you couldn't beat eggs.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.759
It's the principle.

40:17.760 --> 40:19.919
Right, whoever's got it,
wear the mask...

40:19.920 --> 40:21.399
"Wear the mask".

40:21.400 --> 40:22.834
Right.

40:23.440 --> 40:27.039
And exercise some restraint.
Beat her enough to get compensation,

40:27.040 --> 40:28.599
not enough to piss her off.

40:28.600 --> 40:30.959
Crack her on the nose.

40:30.960 --> 40:33.159
What about, er, knee-caps?
They're always good, aren't they?

40:33.160 --> 40:35.719
Definitely no knee-caps. Too far.

40:35.720 --> 40:37.679
Yeah, she wouldn't walk for months.

40:37.680 --> 40:39.279
I've heard nothing.

40:39.280 --> 40:42.914
A targeted beating.
Just enough to fool a loss adjustor.

41:03.532 --> 41:05.484
There you go, love.

41:07.083 --> 41:08.597
Good boy.

41:11.920 --> 41:15.300
You're DNR now, love.
You've already gone, haven't you?

41:24.600 --> 41:28.058
Good night, sweetheart. God bless.

42:02.560 --> 42:04.279
Ate your grapes.

42:04.280 --> 42:05.733
Can you can move your hand?

42:08.240 --> 42:11.256
Yeah, that's the correct account.

42:12.982 --> 42:16.768
I just wanted to check how much we
have outstanding on our Council Tax?

42:27.630 --> 42:28.709
Done.

42:28.717 --> 42:30.334
You better not be winding us up,

42:30.405 --> 42:33.608
cos there is still time
to plant you under a fly-over.

42:36.572 --> 42:38.170

42:40.099 --> 42:42.342
And when will they be
back up and running?

42:44.920 --> 42:47.479
Everyone's system

Give the lady a beer before
I stick my toe up your arse,

44:16.280 --> 44:17.679

Bareback is best, first and always.

Are you a fucking animal?

Guy's just lost a baby.

Why are you all being so nice to me?

45:34.963 --> 45:37.082
You're losing your religion
as we speak.

45:37.240 --> 45:40.300
We've all been there at one point.

45:40.382 --> 45:45.651
You know, I never really thought
of you people as people before.

45:45.680 --> 45:48.448
LAUGHTER

45:56.277 --> 45:58.292
You're a curious one.

46:05.906 --> 46:09.479
You've really achieved something.
I'm proud.

46:11.592 --> 46:15.591
These people here, every one of them,

Licence to sell alcohol... reinstated.

46:24.220 --> 46:26.784
But you said everybody's drinks
were on the house.

46:29.040 --> 46:30.839
You didn't believe that, did you?

46:30.840 --> 46:34.565
Hearts and minds, Karen.
Hearts and minds.

46:43.080 --> 46:44.399
Technique?

46:44.400 --> 46:45.479
Rough.

Six out of ten.

Why am I sitting with you two?

Oh, I'm so confused.

you can't take any more,

'It's easy to give in, to give up.

'It's much harder to look
for the silver lining.

'But it's worth looking for.

47:26.400 --> 47:28.316
'It's really worth looking for.'

47:29.880 --> 47:31.519
Anything wrong with this picture?

47:31.520 --> 47:33.959
Jesus, babe, we're different.

47:33.960 --> 47:37.919
Different doesn't last.
I want an open relationship.

47:37.920 --> 47:39.719
Is it him? Are you doing him?

47:39.720 --> 47:41.239
Calm yourself, fella.

47:41.240 --> 47:43.159
It's the shortest mass
in Manchester.

47:43.160 --> 47:46.519
The funeral crashers. You're
like fucking vultures, you two.

47:46.520 --> 47:48.439
It's a social responsibility.

47:48.440 --> 47:50.159
Any more sherry,
I'll be shitting doilies.

there was Woodstock.

I want you to take your stepfather
out and get him laid.
