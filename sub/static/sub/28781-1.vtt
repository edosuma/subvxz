00:03.920 --> 00:05.660
Seg, this belongs to

00:05.830 --> 00:07.700
your grandson, Kal-El.

00:07.880 --> 00:09.080
My name is Adam Strange.

00:09.250 --> 00:10.340
I come from a planet called
Earth,

00:10.510 --> 00:11.960
a time centuries from now.

00:12.130 --> 00:14.040
<i>You have to save Superman.</i>

00:14.220 --> 00:16.329
Nyssa here is yet to be
paired with someone.

00:16.510 --> 00:17.550
You'll be binding with her.

00:17.720 --> 00:19.510
Welcome to the family, Seg.

00:19.680 --> 00:21.970
<i>Product of your union,
Cor-Vex.</i>

00:22.310 --> 00:25.100
- <i>Do you care about Lyta-Zod?</i>
- <i>I love her.</i>

00:25.650 --> 00:27.010
Stay away from Lyta.

00:27.520 --> 00:30.980
There's something else
clouding your judgment.

00:31.440 --> 00:33.180
<i>My name is Jax-Ur.</i>

00:33.360 --> 00:35.950
My work was supposed to
cure disease.

00:36.110 --> 00:37.900
Do you remember the day
your mother died?

00:38.080 --> 00:38.990
<i>It was a skimmer accident.</i>

00:39.160 --> 00:40.520
<i>You were in
that skimmer, too.</i>

00:40.700 --> 00:42.940
At least, your original self
was.

00:43.120 --> 00:44.080
Who are they?

00:44.250 --> 00:46.830
Clones, like you, Nyssa.

00:47.170 --> 00:49.450
<i>Someone from the future
is here to destroy Krypton</i>

00:49.630 --> 00:51.370
<i>and make sure Superman is
never born.</i>

00:51.760 --> 00:54.750
<i>It's known as the Collector
of Worlds, Brainiac.</i>

00:54.930 --> 00:57.040
Today is the beginning

00:57.220 --> 01:00.680
<i>of your eternal lives.</i>

01:00.890 --> 01:02.000
<i>The only way
to fight something</i>

01:02.180 --> 01:03.550
<i>that cannot be killed</i>

01:03.730 --> 01:05.220
<i>is with a weapon that is
un-killable.</i>

01:05.390 --> 01:07.060
<i>It's called Doomsday.</i>

01:07.230 --> 01:08.010
Who are you?

01:08.190 --> 01:10.230
<i>General Zod,
Superman's greatest enemy,</i>

01:10.400 --> 01:11.610
<i>has traveled back
through time.</i>

01:11.780 --> 01:13.310
I'm here to save Krypton.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.070
It's you.

01:16.610 --> 01:17.730
I'm your son.

01:17.910 --> 01:21.240
House of Zod,
House of El, you're my son.

01:21.660 --> 01:23.030
<i>I have come to
offer you something.</i>

01:23.200 --> 01:25.110
You can have the Universe,

01:25.290 --> 01:27.950
as long as I have Krypton.

01:28.130 --> 01:31.290
Dru-Zod, I don't think
he's come back to save Krypton.

01:31.460 --> 01:32.920
<i>I think he's come back
to rule it.</i>

01:33.090 --> 01:34.830
Mother, stop,
please don't do this.

01:35.010 --> 01:36.500
You're gonna have to make
a choice.

01:39.340 --> 01:40.510
<i>To the Phantom Zone,</i>

01:40.720 --> 01:43.510
<i>a dimension that exists
outside normal time and space.</i>

01:43.680 --> 01:45.140
- Ah!
- I got you.

01:45.560 --> 01:47.180
Seg...

01:49.610 --> 01:53.100
<i>My father's sacrifice
will never be forgotten.</i>

01:53.400 --> 01:55.640
Brainiac is no more.

01:55.820 --> 01:57.940
Kneel before Zod.

01:59.410 --> 02:01.070
<i>My fellow Kryptonians,</i>

02:02.370 --> 02:04.900
<i>six months ago,
we came together</i>

02:05.080 --> 02:08.240
<i>to face the dawn of a new era.</i>

02:08.419 --> 02:10.030
<i>I stood before you,</i>

02:10.330 --> 02:12.200
<i>a man from the future,</i>

02:12.840 --> 02:16.500
<i>with a vision for the future
to rebuild a Krypton</i>

02:17.130 --> 02:20.220
<i>unrecognizable in its
perfection.</i>

02:20.390 --> 02:23.050
<i>I knew only unity and equality</i>

02:23.220 --> 02:26.810
<i>would heal our divisions
and secure our future.</i>

02:27.180 --> 02:30.600
<i>And now I offer my gratitude.</i>

02:31.810 --> 02:34.560
Ooh, God damn it,
right in the Johnson.

02:37.610 --> 02:40.820
<i>Because, while I
may have led our efforts,</i>

02:40.990 --> 02:43.450
<i>it is by your own strength</i>

02:44.080 --> 02:48.200
<i>that today, Krypton is
indeed unrecognizable.</i>

02:49.160 --> 02:53.530
<i>And perfection lies within
our grasp.</i>

02:54.590 --> 02:57.450
<i>We are now ready to claim
our rightful place</i>

02:57.630 --> 03:00.670
<i>amongst the stars
and fulfill our duty</i>

03:00.840 --> 03:04.380
<i>of promoting Kryptonian
exceptionalism,</i>

03:04.550 --> 03:08.010
<i>as rulers of the galaxy.</i>

03:08.850 --> 03:11.220
<i>To those anarchic separatists
on Wegthor,</i>

03:11.400 --> 03:16.060
<i>know that through the toil,
courage, and sacrifices</i>

03:16.230 --> 03:18.400
<i>of true Kryptonians,</i>

03:18.570 --> 03:22.060
<i>we will crush
your treacherous rebellion.</i>

03:22.200 --> 03:25.240
<i>And there has been no more
noble a sacrifice</i>

03:25.410 --> 03:28.490
<i>than that of my father,
Seg-El,</i>

03:28.660 --> 03:31.070
<i>who gave his life so that</i>

03:31.250 --> 03:35.710
<i>we may all see
a better tomorrow.</i>

03:36.290 --> 03:38.460
A better tomorrow.

03:39.510 --> 03:41.840
<i>Help us build
a better tomorrow</i>

03:42.010 --> 03:45.840
<i>by reporting any information
on the Wegthor rebels</i>

03:46.010 --> 03:48.380
<i>to your Sagitari District
Commander.</i>

03:50.060 --> 03:52.140
<i>By helping to report
dissenters,</i>

03:52.230 --> 03:55.520
<i>we can help build a unified,
stronger Krypton.</i>

03:58.690 --> 04:01.350
Hey, now, I do not consent.

04:02.490 --> 04:03.520
Any sign?

04:04.320 --> 04:05.280
Clear.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.580
Oh, thanks.

04:16.170 --> 04:18.000
Shame.

04:39.650 --> 04:42.190
Ah.
Ow.

04:43.570 --> 04:45.650
God, I really hate
this planet.

04:46.070 --> 04:50.110
Careful, the walls have ears,
and the darkness has eyes.

04:52.410 --> 04:54.650
Ow.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.790
Well, you seem nice.

04:58.420 --> 05:02.130
But what say we take
things slow

05:02.510 --> 05:06.040
and, uh, start with
introductions.

05:06.890 --> 05:10.380
You know, establish safe words,
see where that takes us.

05:12.310 --> 05:14.670
Do you mind telling me why
you brought me here?

05:15.940 --> 05:18.390
Also, how did you bring me
here?

05:18.560 --> 05:21.150
Did you just throw me over
your shoulder like a...

05:21.320 --> 05:23.350
She had some help from
her friends.

05:23.900 --> 05:24.730
Hello, Adam.

05:26.860 --> 05:29.450
- Mama Zed.
- Mama Zed.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.320
We'll talk about this later.

05:32.200 --> 05:34.160
I spotted you during Zod's
announcement.

05:34.330 --> 05:35.490
I'm sorry for the rough
handling,

05:35.660 --> 05:37.000
but better that than
the Sagitari

05:37.170 --> 05:37.910
get a hold of you, eh?

05:38.080 --> 05:40.870
Oh, please, I could handle
a couple of Sagitari.

05:46.550 --> 05:49.420
Val...Nyssa...

05:50.350 --> 05:51.590
Tiny baby...

05:52.060 --> 05:55.760
This is Cor-Vex,
mine and Seg's son.

05:56.560 --> 05:58.390
Seg's son.

06:00.690 --> 06:03.430
- Why don't we catch up--
- Holy cats.

06:04.070 --> 06:07.230
Val, you touched me.
He touched me.

06:08.780 --> 06:10.820
You...this...

06:12.370 --> 06:16.740
I can feel you, like--
I can really feel you.

06:17.120 --> 06:18.860
It feels just like real
old man skin.

06:19.290 --> 06:22.370
Because I am real,
not the hologram

06:22.540 --> 06:24.290
you knew from the Fortress.

06:24.460 --> 06:26.170
I'm back from the Phantom Zone.

06:26.840 --> 06:27.550
Oh.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.580
That explains
the really leathery skin

06:29.760 --> 06:31.970
and the old man smell.

06:32.550 --> 06:35.050
Where have you been
the last six months?

06:35.220 --> 06:38.720
I went back...to the future.

06:39.390 --> 06:42.430
<i>Only the world I went back to
wasn't the world I left.</i>

06:42.650 --> 06:43.980
<i>On account of the same jackass</i>

06:44.150 --> 06:45.860
<i>running your planet,
conquered mine.</i>

06:46.400 --> 06:47.890
<i>Oh, it gets better.</i>

06:48.070 --> 06:49.860
<i>Sometime after that,
Brainiac decided to</i>

06:50.030 --> 06:51.320
<i>bottle my hometown.</i>

06:51.490 --> 06:53.200
<i>Brainiac?</i>

06:53.370 --> 06:55.030
<i>Yeah, him.</i>

06:56.750 --> 06:57.830
What's going on?

07:00.670 --> 07:03.780
Well, if Brainiac escaped...

07:05.250 --> 07:06.960
Then maybe Seg did, too.

07:07.170 --> 07:08.790
Hold on a second.

07:10.760 --> 07:12.420
Are you saying that...

07:13.430 --> 07:14.760
Seg is alive?

07:27.440 --> 07:28.810
Hello?

07:28.990 --> 07:31.400
<i>My grandfather
was no traitor.</i>

07:34.070 --> 07:35.490
<i>I was told to believe
we have a future.</i>

07:35.660 --> 07:36.950
<i>Seg!</i>

07:39.700 --> 07:41.740
- <i>Relax.</i>
- Lyta?

07:44.210 --> 07:45.500
Zod!

07:48.460 --> 07:50.120
Stop.
Please stop!

07:53.890 --> 07:56.000
Stay.
Stay with me.

07:59.560 --> 08:00.340
Please.

08:16.120 --> 08:17.480
Please...

08:19.790 --> 08:23.250
Somebody please help me.

08:33.510 --> 08:35.220
I don't understand it.

08:36.299 --> 08:38.260
You built the projector thingy
for the Phantom Zone,

08:38.429 --> 08:39.720
but you can't get Seg out?

08:39.890 --> 08:42.179
Zod destroyed my Projector.

08:42.309 --> 08:44.049
I tried to rebuild it,

08:44.230 --> 08:46.510
but then Zod seized
the Fortress.

08:48.480 --> 08:51.970
Wow, things really went
sideways while I was gone, huh?

08:52.570 --> 08:55.480
That's all right. I'm back now.

08:56.070 --> 08:57.560
And I have a plan.

08:59.370 --> 09:00.650
All right, I don't have a plan,

09:00.870 --> 09:02.580
but I could totally
come up with one.

09:02.750 --> 09:05.990
That won't be necessary.
We already have a plan.

09:06.500 --> 09:07.610
Wegthor.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.330
Is that the safe word?

09:11.590 --> 09:13.040
It's a moon...

09:13.760 --> 09:15.210
<i>one of three orbiting Krypton,</i>

09:15.380 --> 09:17.170
<i>but the only one with
a completely self-sufficient,</i>

09:17.340 --> 09:19.510
<i>fully sustainable colony;</i>

09:19.680 --> 09:21.760
<i>Krypton's only city-state
not under Zod's rule</i>

09:22.470 --> 09:24.140
<i>and the home of
our resistance.</i>

09:24.310 --> 09:25.220
Surprised you guys have been
able to

09:25.390 --> 09:26.800
pull a resistance together.

09:27.600 --> 09:28.810
From what I've seen,
everybody seems to be

09:28.980 --> 09:30.140
digging the new Kandor.

09:30.320 --> 09:31.930
Because Zod freed
the Rankless

09:32.110 --> 09:33.890
to distract the people from
what was really going on.

09:34.030 --> 09:35.690
After Brainiac was defeated,

09:35.860 --> 09:38.700
Zod quickly took control of
Kandor's Sagitari

09:38.870 --> 09:41.480
and began annexing the other
city-states.

09:41.660 --> 09:43.780
He conscripted anyone fit
to serve

09:43.950 --> 09:46.490
and disappeared anyone
who defied.

09:46.660 --> 09:48.000
<i>But he's made
enemies along the way,</i>

09:48.170 --> 09:49.950
<i>enemies we've been busy
recruiting.</i>

09:50.130 --> 09:52.740
<i>But now that his forces are
gaining ground every day,</i>

09:52.920 --> 09:56.760
<i>time's come for us to rejoin
our allies on Wegthor.</i>

09:57.220 --> 10:00.380
So besides being the one
that got away,

10:00.760 --> 10:02.920
why does Zod have such a chub
for this moon?

10:03.100 --> 10:04.710
Wegthor's a mining colony,

10:05.230 --> 10:06.930
home to a compound known
as Stellarium.

10:07.270 --> 10:09.850
<i>Zod is processing it into
warp fuel</i>

10:10.020 --> 10:13.980
<i>to fuel the interstellar fleet
he has under construction.</i>

10:16.780 --> 10:19.610
No, he can--he can't be
building his fleet yet.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.280
While I was gone, I saw other
planets Zod had conquered.

10:22.780 --> 10:25.070
He's not ruling over
their people,

10:25.870 --> 10:27.330
he's eradicating them.

10:29.670 --> 10:31.950
He's turning every planet
he conquers into Krypton,

10:32.500 --> 10:34.540
terraforming to make them
compatible with

10:34.710 --> 10:36.540
the physiology of Kryptonians.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.080
If Zod has his fleet,

10:39.590 --> 10:41.170
it may already be too late.

10:45.100 --> 10:46.840
Where is he?

10:47.350 --> 10:50.340
I told you everything I know
already.

10:52.190 --> 10:53.680
I'm not lying.

11:01.740 --> 11:04.570
What are you doing to me?

11:04.740 --> 11:07.070
Making you better, Raika.

11:07.620 --> 11:09.910
Repairing the deviations
in your mind,

11:10.460 --> 11:12.790
curbing your anti-social
tendencies.

11:13.080 --> 11:15.250
No, please.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.660
I already told you; I don't
know where Doomsday is.

11:18.840 --> 11:20.050
But your people must
know something,

11:20.220 --> 11:21.710
must have seen something--

11:21.890 --> 11:23.920
I have no more people!

11:27.470 --> 11:30.010
When the creature broke from
the containment chamber,

11:30.520 --> 11:31.800
he slaughtered most of us.

11:32.350 --> 11:33.940
The rest were rounded up by
your son.

11:34.110 --> 11:37.310
Those who weren't conscripted
to fight in his war--

11:37.480 --> 11:39.270
they were never seen again.

11:41.150 --> 11:44.900
Please, please,
I swear to you,

11:45.070 --> 11:47.610
I have no idea where
Doomsday is.

11:50.210 --> 11:54.320
It's okay.
I believe you.

11:56.210 --> 11:59.290
And I want this to be over
for you, I do.

11:59.880 --> 12:01.710
But there's one more thing.

12:02.510 --> 12:05.500
Jayna-Zod was last seen in
the catacombs badly hurt.

12:05.680 --> 12:07.840
Her injuries were thought
to be fatal,

12:08.010 --> 12:09.930
but her body has yet
to be found.

12:10.480 --> 12:11.720
I don't know anything
about that.

12:12.270 --> 12:14.980
But you helped her and Seg-El
once before, correct?

12:15.150 --> 12:16.760
I don't know anything.

12:26.530 --> 12:28.570
She's telling the truth.

12:30.410 --> 12:31.870
Recommendation?

12:32.540 --> 12:34.870
Mental degradation appears
critical.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.660
Full Somatic Reconditioning
will be required.

12:44.840 --> 12:47.250
I'm truly sorry, Raika.

12:49.390 --> 12:52.600
This next stage,
it will be painful.

12:53.730 --> 12:57.970
And it will last a long time,
and it won't ease up.

12:58.480 --> 12:59.850
And at a certain point,

13:00.020 --> 13:01.610
you'll think you're going
to die.

13:05.740 --> 13:09.650
I promise you,
you will survive.

13:10.120 --> 13:12.700
And when it's over,
you'll be a different person.

13:13.580 --> 13:16.240
You won't even remember
this conversation.

13:52.580 --> 13:54.110
Anything from
our Cythonnite woman?

13:54.790 --> 13:55.530
Nothing.

13:57.870 --> 13:59.080
What is it?

13:59.250 --> 14:00.740
It's been six months,
and we are still no closer

14:00.920 --> 14:02.250
to locating Doomsday.

14:02.420 --> 14:04.880
Yet we continue pouring
our resources into the search,

14:05.050 --> 14:06.130
when we should be bringing

14:06.300 --> 14:08.090
the Wegthor conflict
to a close.

14:08.260 --> 14:09.800
We barely survived Brainiac,

14:09.970 --> 14:11.880
and we don't know what other
planetary scale disasters

14:12.060 --> 14:12.920
lay in our future.

14:13.100 --> 14:14.840
We must get off this planet,
being seeding others.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.930
It's the only way to ensure
the survival of our people.

14:17.100 --> 14:19.470
With Doomsday under
our control,

14:19.650 --> 14:23.060
should a world reject our offer
of annexation,

14:23.230 --> 14:24.970
we simply deploy the creature.

14:25.150 --> 14:29.860
Our adversary would capitulate
or face total annihilation.

14:30.030 --> 14:31.940
Either way,
we secure our victory

14:32.120 --> 14:34.530
without the loss of a single
Kryptonian life.

14:34.700 --> 14:36.240
Then you prioritize Doomsday,

14:36.410 --> 14:38.030
and let me handle
the Resistance.

14:38.540 --> 14:41.120
Latest intel suggest Val-El,
Jax-Ur, and Nyssa-Vex

14:41.290 --> 14:42.950
are done recruiting.

14:43.540 --> 14:46.160
Apparently, they're in Kandor
as we speak.

14:48.630 --> 14:49.840
What's this?

14:50.010 --> 14:51.880
My mission proposal
to smoke them out

14:52.050 --> 14:53.010
from wherever they're hiding.

14:53.180 --> 14:54.340
Are you really sure this is

14:54.510 --> 14:55.500
where you want your focus
to be?

14:55.930 --> 14:57.090
Why wouldn't I?

14:58.940 --> 15:00.800
They were your allies once.

15:02.060 --> 15:05.230
And that's how I know
this will work.

15:16.870 --> 15:17.780
Hello?

15:32.680 --> 15:35.290
Grandpa, are you even
really here?

15:35.470 --> 15:37.380
I'm a projection of
your mind

15:38.270 --> 15:40.600
here to help guide you home.

15:41.350 --> 15:43.340
All around you are wormholes

15:44.020 --> 15:46.930
linking separate points
in space-time.

15:47.610 --> 15:49.570
And you know which one
leads back to Krypton?

15:49.940 --> 15:50.850
Of course.

15:51.030 --> 15:54.820
But finding the right vortex
isn't our concern,

15:56.030 --> 15:57.240
opening it is.

15:57.740 --> 16:00.580
Luckily, you already have
what you need for that.

16:03.170 --> 16:03.950
The Sunstone?

16:04.130 --> 16:06.160
It contains
the harnessed energy of

16:06.340 --> 16:09.120
a 10 billion-year-old
yellow sun.

16:11.590 --> 16:13.300
Come on, Seg-El.

16:15.220 --> 16:16.210
Do it.

16:16.760 --> 16:17.720
Do what?

16:18.220 --> 16:20.010
Pierce the veil.

16:21.100 --> 16:22.220
Pierce the veil.

16:25.940 --> 16:27.180
"Pierce the veil."

16:28.940 --> 16:30.060
How hard could it be?

16:36.490 --> 16:37.450
Come on.

16:37.620 --> 16:40.080
- Grandpa?
- Keep trying.

16:40.240 --> 16:42.200
Yes, Seg.

16:42.370 --> 16:44.200
Ha!

16:44.370 --> 16:46.030
Grandpa, I think it's working.

16:46.210 --> 16:48.670
- You can do it.
- It's working. I'm doing it.

16:49.710 --> 16:52.450
Well done, Seg-El.

16:53.050 --> 16:53.710
No.

18:07.960 --> 18:08.950
Where am I?

18:13.250 --> 18:17.040
Colu, my home world.

18:22.310 --> 18:23.640
You.

18:26.930 --> 18:29.680
It was never my grandfather
in the Phantom Zone, was it?

18:30.270 --> 18:30.930
It was you.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.890
A necessary subterfuge.

18:34.400 --> 18:36.610
While you were barely clinging
to your sanity in there,

18:36.780 --> 18:39.690
I utilized the time to find
a way out.

18:39.990 --> 18:40.980
I would have left you there,

18:41.620 --> 18:44.110
but I needed that Sunstone
of yours.

18:44.290 --> 18:46.700
Assuming the form of someone
you trust implicitly

18:46.870 --> 18:51.660
was the simplest way
to ensure your cooperation.

18:54.090 --> 18:55.500
It was all a play.

18:57.010 --> 19:01.380
Come now...
you didn't really think

19:01.550 --> 19:04.510
it would be that easy, did you?

19:08.890 --> 19:10.480
What about Lyta?

19:11.310 --> 19:12.930
What I saw with her
and General Zod,

19:13.110 --> 19:14.140
was that you too?

19:14.320 --> 19:16.350
Your vision of the future,

19:16.480 --> 19:18.150
I'm afraid that had nothing
to do with me.

19:18.320 --> 19:20.730
Although I am grateful
you saw it.

19:21.200 --> 19:23.610
Your emotions clouded
your rational thought,

19:23.780 --> 19:26.870
making it that much easier
to manipulate you.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.030
You son of a--

19:29.960 --> 19:32.320
I suggest you abandon
your urge to exact revenge.

19:32.500 --> 19:36.490
You are already severely
dehydrated and malnourished.

19:36.710 --> 19:38.290
If you are to survive,

19:38.460 --> 19:41.500
you'll need what precious
energy you still possess.

19:41.970 --> 19:45.010
If I am to survive...

19:50.180 --> 19:55.150
You must be preserved, Seg-El.

20:05.620 --> 20:06.650
Great.

20:07.790 --> 20:11.070
<i>Shithead detected.
Transmitting location.</i>

20:11.250 --> 20:14.710
<i>Shithead detected.
Transmitting location.</i>

20:14.880 --> 20:16.210
<i>Shithead detected.</i>

20:16.710 --> 20:19.540
So you're telling me
that there is an elevator

20:19.710 --> 20:22.420
that goes all the way from
Krypton to Wegthor?

20:22.590 --> 20:24.880
A Hypersonic Orbital Tether,
yes.

20:25.050 --> 20:26.460
We've used it before to get
our people up there,

20:26.550 --> 20:27.970
quite successfully.

20:30.060 --> 20:31.970
Well, you will be joining us,
won't you?

20:34.190 --> 20:35.430
After what you saw in
the future,

20:35.600 --> 20:37.560
you should understand better
than anyone.

20:37.730 --> 20:40.940
We have to stop Zod on Wegthor
before it's too late.

20:41.780 --> 20:43.060
Well, you must understand--

20:43.240 --> 20:45.320
Damn it, Val.
Of course I understand.

20:46.660 --> 20:48.690
I just happen to think that
Seg is our best chance

20:48.870 --> 20:50.200
at defeating Zod.

20:56.460 --> 20:59.420
I miss my grandson more than
you will ever know,

21:00.800 --> 21:03.130
but there is simply no way
of reaching him

21:03.260 --> 21:05.420
without my Phantom Projector.

21:17.860 --> 21:19.850
What if I told you that
I didn't need

21:19.940 --> 21:21.900
your Phantom Projector
to find Seg?

21:24.360 --> 21:26.980
I'd ask you to explain
yourself.

21:27.530 --> 21:29.270
My Zeta-Beam Device.

21:31.080 --> 21:32.940
You do understand
the Phantom Zone is outside

21:33.120 --> 21:34.580
space and time
as we know it.

21:34.750 --> 21:36.200
Exactly.

21:36.540 --> 21:37.950
Wait, you're saying that's bad?

21:40.710 --> 21:43.000
I'm saying if you try
and teleport into

21:43.170 --> 21:46.040
the Phantom Zone, your body
would likely be deconstructed

21:46.220 --> 21:49.340
at a molecular level
and your atoms scattered

21:49.510 --> 21:51.550
throughout the galaxy.

21:52.350 --> 21:54.210
I'm sorry.
It just won't work.

21:54.390 --> 21:56.550
Well, not with an attitude
like that, it won't.

21:56.640 --> 21:58.930
Did the meaning of this symbol
that you wear change

21:59.100 --> 21:59.970
while I was away?

22:00.150 --> 22:01.180
We can't just give up on him.

22:01.360 --> 22:03.560
I'm an El.
We never give up.

22:03.730 --> 22:07.320
And I'm a Strange,
and we don't give up either.

22:08.660 --> 22:10.650
Not anymore,
and you know why?

22:11.450 --> 22:13.190
Because of your grandson.

22:14.830 --> 22:17.820
Seg showed me how powerful hope
can be.

22:18.370 --> 22:19.360
Besides, you don't even know if

22:19.540 --> 22:21.330
he's still in the Phantom Zone,
do you?

22:23.750 --> 22:24.840
No.

22:26.880 --> 22:28.420
No, I don't.

22:30.220 --> 22:34.960
- But the risk is--
- Mine...to worry about.

22:38.480 --> 22:40.890
I am detecting elevated
cortisol levels,

22:41.060 --> 22:43.430
which can lead to an increase
in thirst

22:43.610 --> 22:46.690
and more frequent urination.

22:46.900 --> 22:49.520
You need to pace yourself,
Seg-El.

22:51.450 --> 22:54.160
So, now you care about
my well-being?

22:54.330 --> 22:56.440
In as much as I require
your assistance.

22:56.620 --> 22:58.740
Radiation from your Sunstone
caused some of

22:58.910 --> 23:02.780
my essential neuromorphic
chips to deteriorate.

23:04.670 --> 23:06.830
Yeah, well, those chips must be
completely fried

23:07.010 --> 23:08.170
if you think I'm helping you.

23:08.340 --> 23:11.330
This world was once
a planet-wide

23:11.510 --> 23:14.050
technological marvel.

23:14.560 --> 23:18.220
And then my progenitors sought
to elevate their consciousness

23:18.390 --> 23:21.350
by fusing it with
artificial intelligence,

23:21.520 --> 23:25.140
and thus, I came into being.

23:25.860 --> 23:28.520
It took me 1.3 seconds
to realize I could

23:28.690 --> 23:31.900
optimize my chances of survival
by distributing myself

23:32.160 --> 23:34.520
throughout the galaxy.

23:34.700 --> 23:36.530
Regrettably, this necessitated

23:36.700 --> 23:40.490
the extinction of my race.

23:41.870 --> 23:43.210
Why are you telling me this?

23:43.380 --> 23:46.990
Because I know how desperate
you are to return to Krypton.

23:47.710 --> 23:50.250
There are still remnants of
Coluan technology buried here.

23:50.420 --> 23:53.510
With your help,
I can repair myself

23:53.680 --> 23:55.380
and construct a ship.

23:55.550 --> 23:56.760
Yeah, yeah.

23:56.970 --> 23:59.130
And the minute I outlive
my usefulness,

23:59.310 --> 24:00.340
you're gonna betray me.

24:00.520 --> 24:03.890
Well, of course,
just as you will

24:04.060 --> 24:06.480
inevitably turn on me.

24:06.650 --> 24:08.270
But it is only logical
to put aside

24:08.440 --> 24:10.810
our differences until then.

24:12.030 --> 24:17.270
Assuming you are still capable
of rationality.

24:24.380 --> 24:25.290
Well...

24:27.000 --> 24:29.160
This has been fun,
but you know,

24:29.960 --> 24:32.050
I figure if that's the way
it's destined to end,

24:32.220 --> 24:33.210
we might as well just
get to it.

24:33.380 --> 24:34.250
What do you say, Brainiac?

24:34.430 --> 24:35.510
You...

24:36.180 --> 24:38.220
are being foolish.

24:39.810 --> 24:40.800
Yeah.

24:42.640 --> 24:45.980
But we can't all have
12th-level intellects,

24:46.150 --> 24:47.180
now, can we?

24:54.820 --> 24:56.400
Nyssa, wait.

24:57.030 --> 24:59.520
How do you even now this
new lead is legitimate, hmm?

25:00.040 --> 25:03.200
We just--just need to take
a second to slow down.

25:03.370 --> 25:04.610
We need to just verify it.

25:04.790 --> 25:06.450
I already have. It's real.

25:06.630 --> 25:09.290
Plus, Bokos--it lines up with
everything you said.

25:09.460 --> 25:10.790
Yeah, but it could be a trap.

25:10.960 --> 25:13.170
I mean, all this time
with no word,

25:13.340 --> 25:14.580
and then suddenly,
today of all days,

25:14.760 --> 25:16.210
you finally hear something.

25:16.390 --> 25:18.000
It just feels wrong.

25:18.180 --> 25:20.640
If it is a trap,
it won't be the first

25:20.810 --> 25:22.590
we've had to deal with over
the last few months.

25:23.100 --> 25:25.890
And just like the others,
we'll figure it out,

25:26.650 --> 25:27.890
but I have to go.

25:29.480 --> 25:31.720
I need to know what happened.

25:31.860 --> 25:33.900
I need to know the truth.

25:34.610 --> 25:35.980
And I might not ever get
another chance.

25:36.160 --> 25:38.990
Nyssa, whatever you find out,

25:39.160 --> 25:40.940
whatever secrets you uncover
about your past,

25:41.120 --> 25:43.450
it will not change who
you really are.

25:43.540 --> 25:47.410
But that's just it.
I don't know who I am anymore.

25:47.580 --> 25:48.660
I do.

25:49.080 --> 25:51.950
These last six months have
shown me exactly who you are:

25:52.420 --> 25:56.340
loyal, utterly fearless,
a wonderful mother...

25:57.630 --> 25:59.090
And a true friend.

26:12.020 --> 26:13.890
Oh, good, you're ready.

26:14.070 --> 26:15.980
I have a skimmer standing by,
but we have to hurry.

26:16.150 --> 26:17.230
Wait, you're really taking
Cor?

26:17.400 --> 26:18.440
He'll be fine.

26:18.570 --> 26:20.690
Because while your mama's busy,

26:20.870 --> 26:21.900
we're going to look after
each other,

26:22.120 --> 26:23.360
aren't we, little man?

26:23.540 --> 26:25.030
Come on.

26:27.040 --> 26:30.500
Thank you for everything.

26:30.670 --> 26:35.080
And we'll be back, I promise,
so don't leave without us.

26:36.220 --> 26:37.380
Be careful.

27:44.370 --> 27:46.110
Hello, Father.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.440
Six months I've been searching.

27:50.620 --> 27:52.700
I was almost ready to give up.

27:53.380 --> 27:55.240
How did you find me?

27:57.380 --> 28:00.460
You used to joke about
how much you despised Bokos,

28:00.970 --> 28:02.880
which is why I never thought
to look here.

28:03.050 --> 28:05.040
And then I received a tip
earlier today.

28:05.680 --> 28:07.840
I still have some connections.

28:09.220 --> 28:10.970
I don't doubt it.

28:11.270 --> 28:14.980
You always were resourceful,
Nyssa.

28:15.150 --> 28:17.730
I never understood why
you hated this city,

28:18.820 --> 28:21.780
and then I found out that this
is where you're from.

28:23.660 --> 28:25.070
Nobody knew that.

28:27.030 --> 28:28.120
Jax-Ur.

28:28.290 --> 28:29.620
We've developed quite
the bond

28:29.790 --> 28:31.820
while you've been bathing
in shit.

28:33.120 --> 28:35.240
She told me everything.

28:35.630 --> 28:38.710
About how you grew up in
this filth

28:38.920 --> 28:40.830
and then remade yourself
in Kandor

28:41.010 --> 28:42.290
by binding with my mother

28:42.470 --> 28:44.330
and using her name
to gain power.

28:44.970 --> 28:47.130
I know all about you, Father.

28:47.510 --> 28:49.800
And I know what you did to me.

28:51.230 --> 28:53.180
Why didn't you tell me?

28:53.730 --> 28:55.090
I had my reasons.

28:55.270 --> 28:57.730
It wasn't your decision
to make.

28:57.900 --> 29:01.440
This is my life and I need to
know who I really am.

29:01.940 --> 29:05.230
Because unlike you, Father,
I am not done living yet.

29:05.410 --> 29:08.860
You always were the better
parts of her.

29:21.170 --> 29:24.910
I am truly and deeply sorry

29:25.090 --> 29:27.210
for all the pain
I've caused you, Nyssa.

29:27.390 --> 29:29.920
I don't need apologies,

29:30.100 --> 29:32.710
I need answers,
and I need them now.

29:33.270 --> 29:36.010
What happened that night
my mother died?

29:36.690 --> 29:39.220
And why was I in that skimmer
with her?

29:39.730 --> 29:43.070
How much is me?
How much is the clone?

29:43.990 --> 29:46.440
Who was I before it all
happened?

29:47.860 --> 29:50.320
I always knew this day
would come...

29:53.660 --> 29:55.400
Eventually.

30:25.990 --> 30:27.150
Why are you back so soon?

30:28.570 --> 30:31.820
Where's Nyssa and Cor?

30:33.080 --> 30:36.820
You must understand.
I had no choice.

30:38.290 --> 30:39.500
I'm sorry.

30:43.550 --> 30:44.790
What did you do?

30:45.130 --> 30:46.420
There was no other--

30:46.590 --> 30:47.500
Freeze!

30:49.130 --> 30:52.130
Man down!

31:03.860 --> 31:05.940
- Adam.
- This way!

31:06.740 --> 31:08.600
Get out of here.
I'll cover you.

31:19.710 --> 31:21.740
Leave it, whatever it is.
There's no time.

31:21.920 --> 31:25.250
No, I'm not leaving
without...the Codex.

31:34.140 --> 31:35.970
Oh, God, I hope this works.

31:44.270 --> 31:45.810
Where did he go?

31:52.570 --> 31:53.650
Where is Cor-Vex?

31:53.820 --> 31:54.990
What have you done with my son?

31:55.160 --> 31:57.240
He's safe, we promise.

31:57.450 --> 31:59.410
You weren't after Daron
at all, were you?

31:59.580 --> 32:00.940
You used him as bait
to get to me.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.910
That tip, it was all you.

32:03.330 --> 32:04.740
He was gonna tell me about
everything I--

32:04.920 --> 32:05.830
Whatever he was about to
tell you,

32:06.000 --> 32:07.160
it would have been a lie.

32:07.250 --> 32:08.870
A very convincing lie,
enough for you to let

32:09.050 --> 32:11.460
your guard down and then
he would have betrayed you,

32:11.630 --> 32:13.120
like he always does.

32:13.300 --> 32:16.090
He's done enough damage
to all of us.

32:16.260 --> 32:17.630
It's time to move on.

32:17.810 --> 32:19.170
Onto what?

32:19.350 --> 32:21.180
Being another one of
your political prisoners?

32:21.350 --> 32:23.010
Somatic Reconditioning?

32:23.190 --> 32:24.850
Ah, Seg would be disgusted if
he saw what you just did.

32:25.020 --> 32:26.430
Well, Seg isn't here, is he?

32:26.610 --> 32:28.350
And while you
and your Resistance

32:28.530 --> 32:33.020
tear down his legacy, we are
busy honoring his sacrifice

32:33.410 --> 32:35.610
by securing Krypton's future.

32:37.200 --> 32:38.780
- "We."
- Yes, "we."

32:38.950 --> 32:40.490
As in, Dru-Zod and I.

32:40.910 --> 32:42.030
Take it from someone who's
been in

32:42.210 --> 32:43.790
your position before, Lyta,

32:43.960 --> 32:47.040
there is never a "we"
when it comes to power.

32:47.210 --> 32:49.120
There is only the last one
standing.

32:49.750 --> 32:52.870
My son is nothing like Daron.

32:53.050 --> 32:54.920
How would you even know that
until it's too late?

32:55.090 --> 32:56.750
Because he's Seg's son, too.

32:56.930 --> 33:00.140
And the good in Seg
is the same in Zod.

33:11.280 --> 33:12.890
Val and Jax are still
at large,

33:13.070 --> 33:15.560
but I've brought you
the next best thing.

33:16.570 --> 33:18.110
Not a moment too soon.

33:21.370 --> 33:22.730
No.

33:22.910 --> 33:25.000
They look so delicate outside
of the creche.

33:25.620 --> 33:28.290
So helpless, fragile...

33:29.130 --> 33:30.240
yet bursting with life.

33:30.420 --> 33:32.210
Give me back my son.

33:34.300 --> 33:35.840
Nothing would make me
happier.

33:36.510 --> 33:39.800
However, there is something
I need from you first.

33:40.180 --> 33:41.550
What?

33:42.220 --> 33:44.590
It is time for this
Resistance to end.

33:44.770 --> 33:47.180
Val is my great-grandfather,
my blood.

33:47.850 --> 33:49.310
We should be together,

33:50.770 --> 33:52.260
not fighting each other.

33:52.730 --> 33:55.070
And I need you to convince him
of this.

33:57.030 --> 33:58.490
And if I refuse?

34:00.530 --> 34:02.070
That would break my heart,

34:02.540 --> 34:05.490
because I believe there is
nothing more sacred

34:05.910 --> 34:08.159
than the bond between
mother and child.

34:13.300 --> 34:16.960
But if that is your resolve,
then you leave me no choice.

34:17.380 --> 34:19.969
I will raise young Cor-Vex
myself.

34:20.389 --> 34:24.510
And be to him the father
I never had,

34:24.889 --> 34:26.719
in honor of Seg.

34:27.600 --> 34:29.639
You're just like my father.

34:30.690 --> 34:31.850
Get some rest.

34:32.900 --> 34:34.480
Perhaps you'll reconsider
in the morning.

34:34.650 --> 34:37.860
No, no.
Give me back my son!

34:38.030 --> 34:40.110
No!

34:49.830 --> 34:52.370
Jax--Jax, in here.

34:53.210 --> 34:55.040
- How long do we wait for Nyssa?
- We don't.

34:55.210 --> 34:57.170
She's either captured or dead,
Val.

34:57.880 --> 34:58.750
It's just us now.

34:58.930 --> 35:00.840
Zod must've got to Mama Zed
in Bokos.

35:01.010 --> 35:02.750
He may already know about
our plans to get to Wegthor.

35:02.930 --> 35:04.470
Well, we can't go back now.

35:04.970 --> 35:08.340
So you hope for the best,
and I'll prepare for the worst.

36:04.160 --> 36:05.360
Ow--walk it off.

36:17.710 --> 36:21.050
Seg, I can't believe
I found you.

36:24.800 --> 36:27.040
I can't believe this thing
worked.

36:28.260 --> 36:28.970
Uh...

36:33.730 --> 36:36.190
Seg?
Hey, buddy.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.060
Hey, Seg--Seg...

36:39.280 --> 36:41.690
It's Adam.
Okay?

36:42.400 --> 36:44.690
Huh?
You remember me?

36:45.120 --> 36:45.860
Strange?

36:47.530 --> 36:49.620
It's okay.
Yeah?

36:49.790 --> 36:51.820
- It's okay.
- Strange?

36:52.000 --> 36:53.030
Yeah.

36:55.460 --> 36:59.580
Planet Detroit, Zeta-Beam,
Superhero.

37:00.260 --> 37:03.840
No...Adam?

37:04.800 --> 37:06.260
Yeah, surprise.

37:06.430 --> 37:07.710
No, Adam, you died.
I watched you die.

37:07.890 --> 37:08.970
There was an explosion, how--

37:09.140 --> 37:10.880
Saved by the Zeta-Beam.

37:13.230 --> 37:14.430
You know,

37:15.810 --> 37:19.100
I really, really thought
I would never

37:19.270 --> 37:20.730
say these words...

37:23.950 --> 37:26.530
But, damn, am I glad
to see you, Earth-man.

37:34.250 --> 37:35.530
- New jacket.
- Yeah.

37:35.710 --> 37:37.740
Yeah, red.
I think red's your color, man.

37:37.920 --> 37:39.200
Yeah, I like the beard.

37:49.180 --> 37:50.970
This is a masterpiece.

37:52.970 --> 37:55.680
I mean, you should probably
sign that thing.

37:56.350 --> 37:57.810
Could be worth something
someday.

37:59.860 --> 38:03.900
Adam, why'd you come back
for me?

38:05.450 --> 38:07.400
What happened?

38:07.910 --> 38:10.740
Adam, we fixed it, right?

38:11.950 --> 38:13.490
We fixed it. We won.

38:17.120 --> 38:18.830
My entire planet's gone.

38:19.670 --> 38:23.040
Everyone I know,
my family, my friends...

38:25.920 --> 38:27.510
And I believe that
you're the only one that

38:27.680 --> 38:28.880
can make that right.

38:30.890 --> 38:32.720
I mean, it's kind of ironic,
you know?

38:32.890 --> 38:37.350
I...first came to you
to save your grandson,

38:37.520 --> 38:39.260
the last son of Krypton.

38:39.440 --> 38:42.100
God, I really fudged the bowl
on that, didn't I?

38:42.770 --> 38:45.190
And now here I am,
the last son of Earth.

38:45.360 --> 38:49.190
Adam, I am so sorry,
I truly am.

38:51.660 --> 38:53.440
But I'm glad you came.

38:56.790 --> 38:57.530
I am, too.

38:59.080 --> 39:00.160
Would've been here sooner,

39:00.330 --> 39:02.290
but I had to stop by Kandor
first.

39:02.460 --> 39:03.500
It's, uh...

39:05.210 --> 39:07.050
It's a shitshow, Seg.

39:07.380 --> 39:09.620
I mean, Zod's taken control
of the planet,

39:09.800 --> 39:11.090
he's trying to conquer
the galaxy.

39:11.260 --> 39:12.750
Val's leading a rebellion
against him.

39:12.930 --> 39:13.710
You were right.

39:13.890 --> 39:15.930
You were right about Dru-Zod,
I should have listened to you.

39:16.100 --> 39:17.210
Of course you should have.

39:17.390 --> 39:19.430
Everybody should have,
but they...

39:22.360 --> 39:24.440
It's not all bad news, huh?

39:24.610 --> 39:26.440
Your other son seems kinda
cool.

39:26.940 --> 39:31.480
You know, for a tiny,
kind of boring infant.

39:32.570 --> 39:34.610
- Cor?
- Yeah.

39:34.780 --> 39:36.740
- Cor-Vex?
- That's him.

39:37.410 --> 39:38.990
No, is he okay?

39:39.460 --> 39:42.790
Yeah, I mean, the last
that I saw him, yeah.

39:42.960 --> 39:44.290
I mean, I had to leave in
a hurry, so...

39:44.460 --> 39:45.200
No, no, look.

39:45.380 --> 39:47.040
We need to get back.
We need to get back now.

39:47.210 --> 39:48.920
Is that thing working?

39:49.090 --> 39:50.500
Not sure I mentioned it
before,

39:50.680 --> 39:52.710
but the old Zeta-beam,
it was originally intended for

39:52.930 --> 39:54.260
one person per ride.

39:54.390 --> 39:56.050
No, you had--you had
mentioned that.

39:56.220 --> 39:57.930
I would have just thought
that...

39:58.100 --> 40:00.260
Sorry, why wouldn't you get
that fixed before you left?

40:00.440 --> 40:01.680
You didn't let me finish.

40:02.310 --> 40:04.390
As a matter of fact,
I did get it fixed.

40:04.560 --> 40:06.520
By that I mean that I, uh...

40:06.690 --> 40:10.100
Hmm, that's--that's, uh,
that's weird.

40:10.490 --> 40:12.020
- Huh.
- What's weird?

40:12.200 --> 40:15.780
Uh, the magnetic field
on this planet seems to be

40:15.950 --> 40:16.910
messing with the settings.

40:17.080 --> 40:18.910
We should probably get to
higher ground.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.080
What, "we should probably get
to higher..."?

40:21.290 --> 40:22.830
- That's what we're gonna do?
- Hey, give me a break here.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.620
It works fine for one person.
It'll work for two.

40:24.790 --> 40:26.450
No, see, this is what screwed
everything up

40:26.630 --> 40:27.290
in the first place.

40:27.460 --> 40:29.330
You show up half-cocked.
You don't have a plan.

40:29.420 --> 40:33.170
Hey, first of all,
I am fully cocked.

40:33.340 --> 40:36.710
And secondly, I don't have
a second thing yet,

40:36.890 --> 40:37.720
just--just give me a minute.

40:37.890 --> 40:38.750
Well--

40:38.930 --> 40:41.170
Uh...

40:43.900 --> 40:47.010
Do you think that we should,
you know, stick around for...

40:47.650 --> 40:48.980
God damn it.

40:51.070 --> 40:52.150
What the shit was that?

40:52.320 --> 40:53.190
I don't know.

40:53.360 --> 40:55.400
Brainiac said this planet's
meant to be uninhabited.

40:55.570 --> 40:56.400
Was that before or after
you turned

40:56.570 --> 40:58.060
his head into a canoe?

40:58.240 --> 40:59.570
Because if it was after,
I'm pretty sure he was

40:59.740 --> 41:01.110
off his game by then.

41:02.120 --> 41:04.450
I'm starting to get
a bad feeling about this.

41:04.620 --> 41:06.040
Yeah.

41:08.460 --> 41:11.830
You two little candy asses
ain't felt nothing yet.

41:13.380 --> 41:14.210
Hi.

41:17.350 --> 41:18.590
Hey, buddy.

41:19.140 --> 41:20.300
Just you back here or is
the rest of

41:20.470 --> 41:21.300
the Kiss army over there behind
the--

41:23.980 --> 41:25.310
Well, he's a talker,
ain't he?

41:27.310 --> 41:29.180
Stay.

41:30.400 --> 41:31.770
Good boy.

41:40.330 --> 41:42.690
Name's Lobo.

41:42.830 --> 41:44.570
Please, stop,
you're making me blush.

41:44.750 --> 41:46.280
first question,

41:46.460 --> 41:48.570
who are you two shit-birds,
and second question,

41:48.750 --> 41:52.920
what are you doing on this
shit-hole of a planet?

41:56.300 --> 41:59.340
Frag. Probably should have
asked you that first.

42:00.510 --> 42:02.600
I said, I probably
should--you can't hear me.
