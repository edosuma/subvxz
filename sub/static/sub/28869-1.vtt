00:49.875 --> 00:51.914
You want something to drink?

00:51.915 --> 00:52.915
Okay, love?

00:58.813 --> 01:00.482
Knock it off, give him back his toy!

01:00.483 --> 01:01.746
What's the matter with you?

01:01.747 --> 01:03.132
- I was just joking.
- Pick on someone

01:03.133 --> 01:03.966
your own size!

01:03.967 --> 01:06.883
Do you want someone to pick on you?

01:17.502 --> 01:18.915
Hey!

01:18.916 --> 01:22.001
Jennette, is that you?

01:22.002 --> 01:24.139
Oh, my God!
- I can't believe it!

01:24.140 --> 01:24.973
Jenny, you look incredible!

01:24.974 --> 01:26.382
Thank you, you too.

01:26.383 --> 01:27.216
Are those your kids?

01:27.217 --> 01:28.216
Yeah.

01:30.020 --> 01:31.041
This is Adam, this is Ben.

01:31.042 --> 01:32.265
Say hi to Mommy's friend, John.

01:32.266 --> 01:33.321
How's it going?

01:40.044 --> 01:41.659
I love what you did with your hair.

01:41.660 --> 01:43.327
Thanks.

01:44.218 --> 01:47.439
So, uh, are you married?

01:47.440 --> 01:50.020
Yeah, that
didn't work out so well.

01:50.021 --> 01:52.438
No, same, same old situation.

02:16.597 --> 02:18.682
You guys want a snack?

02:18.683 --> 02:19.839
You get the Goldfish?

02:19.840 --> 02:22.180
I got the Goldfish.

02:22.181 --> 02:23.758
Oh good, you got the big bag.

02:23.759 --> 02:25.956
So you were gone a while.

02:25.957 --> 02:27.076
Were we?

02:27.077 --> 02:29.076
I don't know, you know,
that's grocery shopping.

02:29.077 --> 02:30.354
A few hours, at least.

02:30.355 --> 02:33.417
You didn't forget anything?

02:33.418 --> 02:35.278
What we talked about last night,

02:35.279 --> 02:36.478
maybe going to the park today?

02:36.479 --> 02:37.636
Oh no, I'm sorry, I did forget!

02:37.637 --> 02:38.637
Sorry.

02:39.919 --> 02:41.336
You're so sweaty.

02:43.797 --> 02:45.459
Yeah, I was working on my bike.

02:45.460 --> 02:47.164
Why does your hair smell?

02:47.165 --> 02:47.997
You smell like cologne.

02:47.998 --> 02:48.831
No, I don't.

02:48.832 --> 02:50.664
Yeah, you do.

02:51.541 --> 02:53.094
- Get off of me!
- Hold it!

02:53.095 --> 02:54.420
Okay, get off me.

02:54.421 --> 02:55.561
I'm just saying.
- Adam?

02:55.562 --> 02:56.421
It's not cologne.

02:56.422 --> 02:58.137
You know what, I'm done talking to you.

02:58.138 --> 02:59.136
I don't believe a word you say.

02:59.137 --> 03:00.136
Hey Adam?

03:02.096 --> 03:03.453
Adam?

03:03.454 --> 03:05.092
Yes?

03:05.093 --> 03:07.215
Anything exciting happen
after the grocery store?

03:07.216 --> 03:10.299
- Oh, for God's sakes.
- A new friend?

03:13.573 --> 03:16.323
We talked to a friend of Mom's.

03:17.552 --> 03:18.809
Is that what you told him to say?

03:18.810 --> 03:19.993
Did he get it right?
- No, we just talked

03:19.994 --> 03:21.193
for two seconds, shut up.

03:21.194 --> 03:22.026
What was her name?

03:22.027 --> 03:22.860
Leave him alone!

03:22.861 --> 03:23.692
You're insane.

03:23.693 --> 03:24.525
Where you going?

03:24.526 --> 03:25.358
I'm not down talking to you!

03:25.359 --> 03:26.192
Don't follow me.

03:26.193 --> 03:27.252
Don't do that, I
hate when you walk away!

03:27.253 --> 03:30.473
It's gonna be okay, I'll be right back.

03:33.201 --> 03:34.202
Mom!

03:34.203 --> 03:36.222
Dad, what are you doing?

03:36.223 --> 03:37.880
Leave her alone!

It's Neil Armstrong.

I'm gonna be an astronaut just like him

04:35.307 --> 04:36.565

04:36.566 --> 04:37.969
Except I want to go to
further away planets.

04:37.970 --> 04:39.605
He only went to the moon.

04:39.606 --> 04:40.929
Just give me a quick
one before the test.

04:40.930 --> 04:41.930
Okay.

04:42.967 --> 04:44.206
Okay.

04:44.207 --> 04:46.470
Okay, just any random one, right?

04:46.471 --> 04:47.469
Yes.

A broker should know that,

04:52.269 --> 04:53.924
shoot.

04:53.925 --> 04:55.089
A broker should know
that a statement about

04:55.090 --> 04:56.748
the material

04:56.749 --> 04:57.916
fact is false.

04:59.170 --> 05:00.183
Yes.

05:00.184 --> 05:01.249
You got it.

05:01.250 --> 05:02.806
You're gonna be selling houses in no time.

05:02.807 --> 05:05.507
Yeah, fingers crossed, I'm gonna be.

05:05.508 --> 05:06.966
Okay.

05:06.967 --> 05:07.967
Please,

05:09.486 --> 05:12.326
eat breakfast and do not
skip school today, okay.

05:12.327 --> 05:13.327
Uh huh.

05:19.085 --> 05:20.145
Hi Ms. Homer.

05:20.146 --> 05:22.119
You know you want it, Ms. Homers.

05:22.120 --> 05:23.287
No, not today.

05:25.675 --> 05:27.092
Hey man.

05:28.018 --> 05:29.615
Do you think she'll smoke
one of these with us one day?

05:29.616 --> 05:30.655
No.

05:30.656 --> 05:31.906
There you go.

05:33.961 --> 05:35.171
Oh shit, where'd you get this?

05:35.172 --> 05:37.089
Don't worry about it.

05:40.559 --> 05:41.896
It's gonna be a good day.

05:41.897 --> 05:42.897
Yeah.

05:45.919 --> 05:47.752
Shit dude, it's Sarah.

05:48.740 --> 05:49.737
Say something.

05:49.738 --> 05:50.755
No dude.

05:50.756 --> 05:51.838
Say something man.

05:51.839 --> 05:52.836
I'm not gonna talk to Sarah.

05:52.837 --> 05:54.373
Dude.
- Hey Sarah.

05:54.374 --> 05:56.456
Looking good Sarah.

05:56.457 --> 05:57.624
That's cute.

05:58.638 --> 05:59.678
Look what you did.

05:59.679 --> 06:01.315
She said that's cute.

06:01.316 --> 06:02.558
Take this.

06:02.559 --> 06:03.573
Why did you do that?

06:03.574 --> 06:04.579
She spoke to us.

06:04.580 --> 06:05.577
She spoke to you.

06:05.578 --> 06:06.595
Now she's not gonna speak to me.

06:06.596 --> 06:09.263
You have to start speaking up.

06:10.116 --> 06:11.135
Whatever man.

06:11.136 --> 06:13.358
Do you want to skip first period?

06:13.359 --> 06:14.995
We have a history test first period.

06:14.996 --> 06:16.158
You studied for that?

06:16.159 --> 06:17.159
No.

06:18.079 --> 06:19.377
I mean I don't want to go to history.

06:19.378 --> 06:20.696
Let's get out of here.

06:20.697 --> 06:22.835
Great decision.

06:22.836 --> 06:24.318
Did you see what she was wearing though?

06:24.319 --> 06:25.876
Oh look at that.

06:25.877 --> 06:26.716
Look at her friend looking at my butt.

06:26.717 --> 06:27.548
Look.

06:27.549 --> 06:28.381
She's checking me out.

06:28.382 --> 06:29.215
She's not looking at you.

06:29.216 --> 06:30.382
She's checking out my butt.

06:30.383 --> 06:32.800
Now this is a record store.

06:34.980 --> 06:36.230
You like Bowie?

06:37.281 --> 06:38.556
Sometimes.

06:38.557 --> 06:39.557
Sometimes.

06:52.926 --> 06:54.163
What do you mean?

06:54.164 --> 06:55.440
This is a lot.

06:55.441 --> 06:56.524
Overwhelming.

06:58.865 --> 07:00.400
Dude, I mean

07:00.401 --> 07:02.421
music is supposed to be heard on vinyl.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.723
It's authentic.

07:03.724 --> 07:04.800
You know what else is authentic?

07:04.801 --> 07:05.861
My iPod.

07:05.862 --> 07:07.664
Your iPod is not authentic.

07:07.665 --> 07:08.944
What are you talking about?

07:08.945 --> 07:10.187
You kids
gonna buy something or what?

07:10.188 --> 07:12.224
No thanks sir, we're just browsing.

07:12.225 --> 07:15.643
Okay, well there's no
browsing in my store.

07:15.644 --> 07:16.821
But something or get out.

07:16.822 --> 07:18.301
Did he just say there's no browsing?

07:18.302 --> 07:20.043
What do you mean no browsing?

07:20.044 --> 07:21.141
We're in a store.

07:21.142 --> 07:22.739
Yeah, it's not a library.

07:22.740 --> 07:24.224
Buy something or get the hell out.

07:24.225 --> 07:25.892
You know what sir,

07:27.025 --> 07:29.359
this is terrible customer service.

07:29.360 --> 07:30.501
Yeah, I'm trying to find a record.

07:30.502 --> 07:32.260
So I won't be
making any purchases today.

07:32.261 --> 07:33.824
Oh I'm sorry, maybe you should register

07:33.825 --> 07:35.563
a complaint to the corporate office.

07:35.564 --> 07:37.019
Actually, I change my mind.

07:37.020 --> 07:38.500
I want to buy this.

07:38.501 --> 07:40.400
Oh, I want to buy all of these.

07:40.401 --> 07:42.099
I want to get that.

07:42.100 --> 07:44.043
Get those ones.

07:44.044 --> 07:45.081
And I want to get this.

07:45.082 --> 07:46.101
Oh, I changed my mind again.

07:46.102 --> 07:47.680
Jokes on you.

07:47.681 --> 07:49.184
And guess what,

07:49.185 --> 07:50.795
we actually had money.

07:50.796 --> 07:52.379
Oh, what a shame.

07:53.745 --> 07:57.520
Bro, I told you
today was gonna be a good day.

07:57.521 --> 08:00.771
Yeah, I just hope Mr. Z's not pissed.

08:01.681 --> 08:03.504
I actually like that class.

08:03.505 --> 08:04.505
Nice man.

08:07.481 --> 08:09.563
I mean I was gonna buy it,

08:09.564 --> 08:11.564
but he was being a dick.

08:12.962 --> 08:13.980
Hey Keith.

08:13.981 --> 08:15.559
How do you talk to girls like Sarah?

08:15.560 --> 08:18.227
Probably because I'm charming.

08:20.276 --> 08:22.001
Got a little facial hair.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.420
Dude,

08:23.421 --> 08:26.321
I'm being serious, come on.

08:26.322 --> 08:29.100
It's confidence man, confidence.

08:29.101 --> 08:30.876
You know what,

08:30.877 --> 08:32.631
I'm gonna set you up tomorrow.

08:32.633 --> 08:34.517
And you're not gonna know it's coming,

08:34.518 --> 08:36.698
so you're not gonna be nervous.

08:36.698 --> 08:37.676
What do you mean?

08:37.677 --> 08:39.958
Don't worry about that, okay.

08:39.960 --> 08:42.139
Let's make a bet.

08:42.140 --> 08:44.119
Let's put 20 bucks on it.

08:44.120 --> 08:45.108
All right.

08:45.109 --> 08:46.098
20 bucks?

08:46.099 --> 08:47.159
Deal?

08:47.160 --> 08:48.003
Deal.

08:48.004 --> 08:48.848
Cool.

08:48.849 --> 08:50.294
Easy money.

08:50.295 --> 08:52.573
One can never be alone enough to write,

08:52.574 --> 08:54.152
to see better.

08:54.153 --> 08:56.236
The writer, Susan Sontag said that.

08:56.237 --> 08:58.433
And Keats, you all remember Keats?

08:58.434 --> 08:59.436
Yeah.

08:59.437 --> 09:02.156
Keats said that solitude
is our greatest conduit

09:02.157 --> 09:04.134
into truth and beauty.

09:04.135 --> 09:05.135
Solitude.

09:06.455 --> 09:08.017
A lot of great writers who were loners.

09:08.018 --> 09:09.574
Angel's a great writer.

09:09.575 --> 09:10.593
Thank you.

09:10.594 --> 09:13.857
Having said that, how do we tell stories

09:13.858 --> 09:15.596
without experience?

09:15.597 --> 09:17.153
We need to interact with the world to

09:17.154 --> 09:19.377
be inspired, right,

09:19.378 --> 09:20.897
to grow as artists.

09:20.898 --> 09:23.134
Dave Hume called it our
intercourse with the world.

09:24.978 --> 09:25.975
Why is that funny?

09:27.698 --> 09:31.174
All right, you all graduate
one month from today.

09:33.298 --> 09:35.857
Your final assignment for me

09:35.858 --> 09:38.017

09:38.018 --> 09:40.235
that moved you, that inspired you,

09:40.236 --> 09:41.814
that rocked your world.

09:41.815 --> 09:44.156
It can be about the love of
your life broke your heart.

09:44.157 --> 09:47.313
Or the day you say a leaf fall from a tree

09:47.314 --> 09:49.257
and thought it was beautiful.

09:49.258 --> 09:50.414
10 pages minimum.

09:50.415 --> 09:51.913
Now's a good time to start your outlines.

09:51.914 --> 09:54.664
Come on, you got 20 minutes left.

09:57.055 --> 09:57.888
Hey.

09:57.889 --> 09:59.156
What?

09:59.157 --> 10:01.372
I'm sorry, I think this is your pencil.

10:01.373 --> 10:02.996
You know it's not my pencil.

10:02.997 --> 10:04.398
Are we discussing your experience

10:04.399 --> 10:05.758
with the leaf, Mr. Bruner?

10:05.759 --> 10:07.497
I'm sorry, Mr. Z.

10:07.498 --> 10:08.697
Mr. Z.

10:08.698 --> 10:10.057
Yeah?

10:10.058 --> 10:11.214
We need to go to the bathroom.

10:11.215 --> 10:12.217
Together?

10:13.759 --> 10:16.558
Actually yes, we ate a burrito together.

10:16.559 --> 10:17.836
Dude.

10:17.837 --> 10:18.878
A bad burrito.

10:18.879 --> 10:21.097
Actually, a problematic burrito.

10:21.098 --> 10:22.617
Sit down, Mr. Kelly.

10:28.157 --> 10:29.198
Is this your pencil?

10:29.199 --> 10:30.436
Seriously?

10:30.437 --> 10:32.235
I mean what
was I supposed to say?

10:32.236 --> 10:33.998
Say Sarah,

10:33.999 --> 10:34.997
you look beautiful.

10:34.998 --> 10:36.996
Sarah this shirt complements your eyes.

10:36.997 --> 10:38.414
Sarah, you want to go grab a bite to eat?

10:38.415 --> 10:39.998
I'm not you dude.

10:40.837 --> 10:43.694
I'm not smooth like that, you know.

10:43.695 --> 10:45.737
We need to get you out of your element,

10:45.738 --> 10:47.973
put you in a different environment

10:47.974 --> 10:49.231
where nobody knows you.

10:49.232 --> 10:50.651
I'm gonna cupid the shit out of you.

10:50.652 --> 10:53.335
What are you talking about?

10:53.336 --> 10:55.054
You know where we're gonna go?

10:55.055 --> 10:56.191
No.

10:56.192 --> 10:57.534
Venice.

10:57.535 --> 11:00.493
I'm gonna get you some girls.

11:00.494 --> 11:01.494
All girls.

11:02.437 --> 11:03.716
Tall, short,

11:03.717 --> 11:04.835
big, small.

11:04.836 --> 11:06.836
You're ridiculous man.

11:08.895 --> 11:09.977
Cheeseburger, cheeseburger.

11:09.978 --> 11:11.113
John Belushi.

11:11.114 --> 11:12.254
Oh, you cool, you got burgers.

11:12.255 --> 11:13.934
No, I got a burger.

11:13.935 --> 11:16.430
Sorry dude, I thought your
mom would have cooked for you.

11:16.431 --> 11:20.014
I guess I shouldn't be
surprised she's not.

11:21.071 --> 11:22.085
What the hell?

11:22.086 --> 11:23.572
What's going on out there?

11:23.573 --> 11:25.332
She's bathing Ben.

11:25.333 --> 11:27.000
Why, is he a duck?

11:29.460 --> 11:31.670
That shit's funny.

11:31.671 --> 11:35.450
The bathroom hasn't been
fixed in like a month.

11:35.451 --> 11:36.494
There you go.

11:36.495 --> 11:37.577
Any fucking excuse, right.

11:37.578 --> 11:40.755
You know, I worked 54 and
a half hours last week.

11:40.756 --> 11:43.394
When the hell am I supposed to come home,

11:43.395 --> 11:44.953
and do the plumbing,

11:44.954 --> 11:46.174
and do the lawn,

11:46.175 --> 11:49.008
and do all the other fucking shit.

11:50.212 --> 11:51.795
No, no, keep writing.

11:51.796 --> 11:52.796
Really.

11:53.532 --> 11:55.593
I'll be in my room.

11:55.594 --> 11:56.594
Whatever.

11:58.071 --> 11:59.155
Here, take this.

11:59.156 --> 12:00.334
No, I don't need it.

12:00.335 --> 12:01.347
It's fine.

12:01.348 --> 12:03.189
You don't need it now.

12:03.190 --> 12:07.023
You can bitch about it,
but you don't need it.

12:27.194 --> 12:28.175
Ah, this is beautiful.

12:28.176 --> 12:29.673
We're gonna find the
perfect match for you, okay.

12:29.674 --> 12:30.851
Okay.

12:30.852 --> 12:31.685
We're gonna get you a 10.

12:31.686 --> 12:32.518
We ain't settling.

12:32.519 --> 12:33.826
That's all I'm saying.

12:33.827 --> 12:34.659
A 10?

12:34.660 --> 12:35.493
Which one you want?

12:35.494 --> 12:36.404
That one?

12:36.405 --> 12:37.407
Not her.

12:37.408 --> 12:38.485
Why you looking over there?

12:38.486 --> 12:39.468
You said not her.

12:39.469 --> 12:40.485
So I just look automatically.

12:40.486 --> 12:42.107
No, don't look over there.

12:42.108 --> 12:43.467
Oh, roller blades.

12:43.468 --> 12:44.507
Perfect.

12:44.508 --> 12:45.522
Perfect.

12:45.523 --> 12:46.525
Talk to her.

12:46.526 --> 12:48.266
Oh I am so sorry.

12:48.267 --> 12:49.267
Seriously?

12:50.790 --> 12:51.905
I'm so sorry.

12:51.906 --> 12:52.949
Go talk to her.

12:52.950 --> 12:54.102
Dude, why did you do that?

12:54.103 --> 12:55.328
Let her hit you?

12:55.329 --> 12:56.468
So you can talk to her, bro.

12:56.469 --> 12:58.002
Oh right here, hey, hey, hey.

12:58.003 --> 12:59.003
Hello.

13:03.429 --> 13:04.448

13:04.449 --> 13:05.450
Dude, come on.

13:05.451 --> 13:06.549
You wave to her bro.

13:06.550 --> 13:07.808
I didn't know what to do.

13:07.809 --> 13:08.987
I'm done.

13:08.988 --> 13:10.389
This is pointless.

13:10.390 --> 13:11.564
Man.

13:11.565 --> 13:12.397
Just talk.

13:12.398 --> 13:13.230
I don't know what to say.

13:13.231 --> 13:14.063

Yeah.

13:22.368 --> 13:25.118
I'll call you later, all right.

13:29.131 --> 13:30.330
How did you?

13:30.331 --> 13:31.328

13:31.329 --> 13:32.367
That's all I'm saying.

13:32.368 --> 13:34.170

13:34.171 --> 13:35.171

13:50.487 --> 13:51.508

13:51.509 --> 13:52.511
We lost them, bro.

13:52.512 --> 13:54.127
Dude, they went through the crowd.

13:54.128 --> 13:55.130
Your fault.

13:55.131 --> 13:55.964
How is that my fault?

13:55.965 --> 13:56.964
Man.

14:05.234 --> 14:06.231

14:06.232 --> 14:08.513

Go.

14:09.730 --> 14:10.971
Dude, okay.

Excuse me.

Hi.

14:26.871 --> 14:27.871
Hey.

14:28.867 --> 14:31.450

14:32.728 --> 14:33.728
And,

14:49.370 --> 14:51.569

14:51.570 --> 14:54.737
Well I mean you just looked beautiful.

14:55.852 --> 14:58.411
But I'm sorry though.

14:58.412 --> 14:59.830
I didn't mean to bother you.

14:59.831 --> 15:01.051
No, no, it's,

Oh shit.

15:39.431 --> 15:41.227

15:49.111 --> 15:50.689
Even horses know,

25:02.935 --> 25:04.693
I didn't know that.

25:04.694 --> 25:06.457
That's really cool.

25:06.458 --> 25:08.100

25:08.101 --> 25:10.499
it collapses in on itself

25:10.500 --> 25:12.682
and creates a black hole
that will suck in anything,

25:12.683 --> 25:13.683

25:15.040 --> 25:16.040

25:23.920 --> 25:25.359
Wow.

25:25.360 --> 25:27.380

including the Milky Way

25:27.381 --> 25:28.659
have black holes in their center.

35:12.622 --> 35:13.622
I,

35:14.425 --> 35:17.675
I had a really amazing time last night.

35:32.344 --> 35:33.623
That's for you,

35:33.624 --> 35:34.964
20 bucks.

35:34.965 --> 35:36.647
Dude, forget it.

35:36.648 --> 35:37.666
That's yours, take it.

35:37.667 --> 35:38.807
No.

35:38.808 --> 35:40.007
Take that girl.

35:40.008 --> 35:41.008
Oh my god,

35:41.688 --> 35:43.207
I can't even describe it.

35:43.208 --> 35:44.327
Like

35:44.328 --> 35:45.326
she's not a number,

35:45.327 --> 35:46.440
she's not a number.

35:46.441 --> 35:47.666
You know what she is,

35:47.667 --> 35:49.245
she's an asterisk.

35:49.246 --> 35:51.543
She's an asterisk.

35:51.544 --> 35:53.687
Actually no, she's an exclamation mark.

35:53.688 --> 35:55.565
What are you talking,

35:55.566 --> 35:57.816
what are you talking about?

36:00.584 --> 36:01.578
I know that look.

36:01.579 --> 36:03.741
What's going on in your head?

36:03.742 --> 36:06.954
I think I, I think I might...

36:06.955 --> 36:08.474
Don't say those words.

36:08.475 --> 36:09.754
Do not say it.

36:09.755 --> 36:10.755
Okay.

36:11.435 --> 36:12.437
Yeah but...

36:12.438 --> 36:13.594
Say that again,

36:13.595 --> 36:16.938
I'll hit you across the
head with this rock.

36:16.939 --> 36:18.090
All right man, I won't say it.

36:18.091 --> 36:20.255
Rule number one, we don't say that word.

36:20.256 --> 36:21.477
That's all I'm saying, okay.

36:21.478 --> 36:23.877

in your little journal.

36:23.878 --> 36:25.128

36:30.454 --> 36:31.872

36:31.873 --> 36:33.395

36:37.056 --> 36:38.495

36:38.496 --> 36:39.328
Hey, how you doing Kieth?

36:39.329 --> 36:40.162
What up, Mr. Broner.

36:40.163 --> 36:40.994

36:40.995 --> 36:41.828
Hey Mrs. Broner.

36:41.829 --> 36:42.730
Hey sweetie.

36:42.731 --> 36:43.632
Hey.

36:43.633 --> 36:44.653
Yeah, we were just studying

36:44.654 --> 36:45.654

36:45.655 --> 36:46.655
Yeah, I bet you were.

36:46.656 --> 36:47.674
We were.

36:47.675 --> 36:49.055
Look, did you know that
the national anthem

36:49.056 --> 36:50.511
was inspired by the 1812 war?

36:50.512 --> 36:52.415
So these guys just chilling

36:52.416 --> 36:54.175
in his jail cell, right.

36:54.176 --> 36:55.871
He see the bombs go off...

36:55.872 --> 36:57.535
Hey, I don't really need the soda.

36:57.536 --> 36:58.591
I'm not really thirsty or anything.

36:58.592 --> 36:59.631
Yeah, the bathroom's upstairs.

36:59.632 --> 37:01.132
Go fix it asshole.

37:02.256 --> 37:03.088
Get off my fucking back.

37:03.089 --> 37:03.922
Fix the bathroom, it's upstairs.

37:03.923 --> 37:05.747

37:05.748 --> 37:06.749

37:06.750 --> 37:08.288

37:08.289 --> 37:09.122

37:09.123 --> 37:10.165

37:10.166 --> 37:11.304
Dude, stop hitting on my mom.

37:11.305 --> 37:13.128
Thanks, Keith.

37:13.129 --> 37:14.721
Dude, I'm not gonna
bring you over here anymore

37:14.722 --> 37:16.925
if you're staring at my mom all the time.

37:16.926 --> 37:18.024
All right.

37:18.025 --> 37:19.264
Do you need help folding
those clothes, Mrs. Broner?

37:19.265 --> 37:21.107
Yeah, why don't you help me with these?

37:21.108 --> 37:22.191
Oh.

37:23.486 --> 37:24.664

38:08.573 --> 38:09.735
Keith and Maya,

38:09.736 --> 38:12.572

movies tomorrow night.

38:12.573 --> 38:13.906
Do you wanna go?

38:18.216 --> 38:20.299
Oh, like a double date?

38:23.453 --> 38:24.786
Yeah, I guess.

38:27.872 --> 38:28.872
No.

38:31.016 --> 38:34.593

01:05:09.694 --> 01:05:11.029
Everything okay?

01:05:11.030 --> 01:05:12.528
Fuck.

01:05:12.529 --> 01:05:13.533
What's wrong?

01:05:13.534 --> 01:05:14.531
We gotta go.

01:05:14.532 --> 01:05:16.106
Your friends are in my parents' bedroom

01:05:16.107 --> 01:05:18.013
shooting up or something.

01:05:18.014 --> 01:05:18.990
Wait, my friends.

01:05:18.991 --> 01:05:20.009
Just calm down, okay.

01:05:20.010 --> 01:05:21.133
Don't tell me to calm down.

01:05:21.134 --> 01:05:22.272
Do you have any idea
what my parents would do

01:05:22.273 --> 01:05:23.151
if they knew?

01:05:23.152 --> 01:05:23.985
Adam would never...

01:05:23.986 --> 01:05:25.890
This is Adam and his girlfriend.

01:05:25.891 --> 01:05:26.973
It's not.

01:05:26.974 --> 01:05:28.010
Let me just go in there and check.

01:05:28.011 --> 01:05:29.314
I think you should
just take them and leave.

01:05:29.315 --> 01:05:30.850
Adam.

01:05:30.851 --> 01:05:33.907
Caroline just said somebody's
up there doing dope.

01:05:33.908 --> 01:05:36.089
Dude, it's none of your business man.

01:05:36.090 --> 01:05:38.173
You're doing that shit?

01:05:39.251 --> 01:05:41.314
Fucking kidding me.

01:05:41.315 --> 01:05:42.147
Let me see.

01:05:42.148 --> 01:05:42.981
Fuck, get off of me.

01:05:42.982 --> 01:05:44.296
She's bringing you down the wrong path.

01:05:44.297 --> 01:05:48.354
You think the skank
inside there is so cool.

01:05:48.355 --> 01:05:50.252
That's not you, man.

01:05:50.253 --> 01:05:52.216
You're better than that, okay.

01:05:52.217 --> 01:05:54.637
Dude, fuck you man.

01:05:54.638 --> 01:05:55.871
Fuck me?

01:05:55.872 --> 01:05:57.071
Yeah, I said fuck you.

01:05:57.072 --> 01:05:58.157
You heard me.

01:05:58.158 --> 01:05:59.155
Fuck me?

01:05:59.156 --> 01:06:00.253
Fuck you, man.

01:06:00.254 --> 01:06:01.850
Fuck you, Kieth.

01:06:01.851 --> 01:06:03.474
Fuck you, you serious, dude,

01:06:03.475 --> 01:06:04.594
I'm telling you...

01:06:04.595 --> 01:06:05.595
fuck.

01:06:06.937 --> 01:06:07.937
Oh fuck.

01:06:09.113 --> 01:06:10.571
You feel like a superhero?

01:06:10.572 --> 01:06:12.136
That dope got you
feeling like a superhero?

01:06:12.137 --> 01:06:13.334
Now I wish you were dead Keith.

01:06:13.335 --> 01:06:14.994
She's bringing you down the wrong path.

01:06:14.995 --> 01:06:16.832
Alice.

01:06:49.875 --> 01:06:50.877
Hey T.

01:06:50.878 --> 01:06:52.378
What's up Alice?

01:06:53.252 --> 01:06:55.933
I'm just here to see Raffi.

01:06:55.934 --> 01:07:00.034
Alice, who do you know that lives here?

01:07:00.035 --> 01:07:01.837
It's cool.

01:07:01.838 --> 01:07:02.838
It's okay.

01:07:04.995 --> 01:07:07.677
There's my baby.

01:07:07.678 --> 01:07:09.496
Hey Raffi.

01:07:09.497 --> 01:07:11.210
Eyes like an angel.

01:07:11.211 --> 01:07:12.211
This one.

01:07:19.598 --> 01:07:21.256
Who this?

01:07:21.257 --> 01:07:22.514
Oh, he's cool.

01:07:22.515 --> 01:07:23.814
Don't worry about it.

01:07:23.815 --> 01:07:25.293
Is that right?

01:07:25.294 --> 01:07:26.593
You cool man?

01:07:26.594 --> 01:07:28.157
Yeah.

01:07:28.158 --> 01:07:29.833
He is.

01:07:39.875 --> 01:07:41.954
This ain't enough.

01:07:41.955 --> 01:07:43.538
Put it on my tab.

01:07:47.033 --> 01:07:49.107
Your tab's too long baby.

01:07:49.108 --> 01:07:51.275
There's other ways to pay.

01:07:57.033 --> 01:07:58.456
Come on, Adam.

01:07:58.457 --> 01:07:59.790
It's time to go.

01:09:05.154 --> 01:09:06.153
Alice, I don't
know if we should do this.

01:09:06.154 --> 01:09:07.432
Shut up.

01:09:07.433 --> 01:09:09.014
Do you have any fucking better ideas?

01:09:09.015 --> 01:09:11.412
How we gonna find the right house?

01:09:11.412 --> 01:09:14.662
Just look for the one without lights.

01:09:18.334 --> 01:09:19.495
Okay, this is good.

01:09:19.496 --> 01:09:20.493
Alice.

01:09:20.495 --> 01:09:21.591
Just hurry up.

01:09:21.593 --> 01:09:23.015
Slowly, slowly.

01:09:23.017 --> 01:09:23.849
Just careful.

01:09:23.850 --> 01:09:24.683
All right, I'm trying.

01:09:24.684 --> 01:09:25.515
Shit.

01:09:25.517 --> 01:09:27.261
It's stuck.

01:09:29.198 --> 01:09:30.448
Fuck.

01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:32.393
Help me with this.

01:09:44.096 --> 01:09:45.095
There's nothing here.

01:09:45.096 --> 01:09:46.179
Just help me.

01:09:47.698 --> 01:09:48.553
Just keep looking.

01:09:48.554 --> 01:09:49.408
I'm okay.

01:09:49.410 --> 01:09:50.669
Did you find anything?

01:09:50.670 --> 01:09:51.502
No.

01:09:51.502 --> 01:09:52.354
Did you?

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:53.352
No.

01:09:53.353 --> 01:09:54.354
Shit, shit, I found something.

01:09:54.355 --> 01:09:55.355
Shh.

01:09:59.496 --> 01:10:01.373
What?

01:10:19.214 --> 01:10:20.215
How much did we get?

01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:21.495
50, 75.

01:10:21.496 --> 01:10:22.514
What?

01:10:22.515 --> 01:10:23.432
$60.

01:10:23.433 --> 01:10:24.850
That's all we could fucking get?

01:10:24.851 --> 01:10:25.866
That's what I said, Alice.

01:10:25.867 --> 01:10:26.930
$60.

01:10:26.931 --> 01:10:28.050
Well we need more.

01:10:28.051 --> 01:10:29.970
What the fuck do you expect me to do?

01:10:29.971 --> 01:10:31.069
Don't you fucking yell at me.

01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:32.108
This is it.

01:10:32.109 --> 01:10:33.507
It's all I could fucking get.

01:10:33.508 --> 01:10:34.341
You're a fucking idiot.

01:10:34.342 --> 01:10:35.173
Let me think.

01:10:35.174 --> 01:10:36.088
Shut up.

01:10:36.089 --> 01:10:37.309
Shut the fuck up.

01:10:37.310 --> 01:10:39.426
All I asked for was this fucking thing.

01:10:39.427 --> 01:10:43.090
What the fuck
do you want me to do?

01:10:43.091 --> 01:10:43.923
What

01:10:43.924 --> 01:10:44.756
do you

01:10:44.757 --> 01:10:45.590
want from me?

01:10:45.591 --> 01:10:46.840
You said you fucking loved me.

01:10:46.841 --> 01:10:47.822
I do love you, Alice.

01:10:47.823 --> 01:10:49.357
Yeah, well I don't
fucking believe you anymore.

01:10:49.358 --> 01:10:50.358
Fuck.

01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:54.240
Fuck.

01:11:02.618 --> 01:11:03.951
I'm sorry, okay.

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:08.877
I'm going to figure this out, okay.

01:11:08.878 --> 01:11:10.440
How?

01:11:10.441 --> 01:11:13.197
I can't count on you for anything.

01:11:13.198 --> 01:11:15.281
I will figure this out.

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:12.060
Well?

01:12:13.481 --> 01:12:15.398
Hey, I got it.

01:12:24.441 --> 01:12:25.441
Thank you.

01:12:31.801 --> 01:12:33.880
Did you get it from Raffi?

01:12:33.881 --> 01:12:35.379
Yeah.

01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:38.047
He has the good stuff.

01:12:40.798 --> 01:12:44.040
Will you light me up one real quick?

01:12:44.041 --> 01:12:45.041
After me.

01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:25.860
Hey.

01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:31.500
Hey, babe.

01:13:33.881 --> 01:13:35.464
We need more money.

01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:39.354
I'm high on money.

01:13:39.355 --> 01:13:40.696
No, no, no, no.

01:13:40.697 --> 01:13:42.280
We need more money.

01:13:44.201 --> 01:13:45.597
Okay.

01:13:45.598 --> 01:13:47.016
Okay?

01:13:47.017 --> 01:13:48.017
Okay.

01:13:52.457 --> 01:13:53.656
I'll get us money.

01:13:53.657 --> 01:13:55.074
Please.

01:14:08.535 --> 01:14:09.736
Hey man.

01:14:09.737 --> 01:14:11.570
Thanks for meeting me.

01:14:13.241 --> 01:14:14.633
Can you help me?

01:14:14.634 --> 01:14:15.598
What do you need help with?

01:14:15.599 --> 01:14:16.772
I need some money, man.

01:14:16.773 --> 01:14:17.775
Come on.

01:14:17.776 --> 01:14:18.774
You need some money?

01:14:18.775 --> 01:14:19.777
Yeah.

01:14:19.778 --> 01:14:21.437
Some money.

01:14:21.438 --> 01:14:22.936
Why do you need money, Adam?

01:14:22.937 --> 01:14:24.293
Dude,

01:14:24.294 --> 01:14:25.720
I'm trying to get clean, okay.

01:14:25.721 --> 01:14:27.298
This is for Alice.

01:14:27.299 --> 01:14:28.659
Just give me some fucking money.

01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:29.661
Oh, this is for Alice?

01:14:29.662 --> 01:14:30.660
Yeah.

01:14:30.661 --> 01:14:31.661
So you gonna lie to my face right now?

01:14:31.662 --> 01:14:32.660
I'm not lying to you.

01:14:32.661 --> 01:14:33.661
You're lying to me Adam.

01:14:33.662 --> 01:14:34.661
I'm not lying to you.

01:14:34.662 --> 01:14:35.917
Look at you, this is not you, man.

01:14:35.918 --> 01:14:37.880
You know we have graduation
in a week, right?

01:14:37.881 --> 01:14:39.939
Do you even care?

01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:42.317
You're fucking with me, man.

01:14:42.318 --> 01:14:44.233
Why you always fucking with me, huh?

01:14:44.234 --> 01:14:45.077
Don't touch me.

01:14:45.078 --> 01:14:45.920
Fuck you.

01:14:45.921 --> 01:14:46.754
Don't touch me, man.

01:14:46.755 --> 01:14:48.254
Fuck you, Keith.

01:14:49.818 --> 01:14:50.818
Chill man.

01:14:52.379 --> 01:14:53.940
Why?

01:14:53.941 --> 01:14:55.024
Fuck you man.

01:14:55.861 --> 01:14:58.260
Adam, I was your last real friend, Adam.

01:14:58.261 --> 01:14:59.780
I was your last real friend.

01:14:59.781 --> 01:15:00.857
Fuck off.

01:15:00.858 --> 01:15:02.297
Get the fuck out.

01:15:02.298 --> 01:15:04.697
You need help.

01:15:04.698 --> 01:15:06.180
You need help, Adam.

01:15:43.874 --> 01:15:44.937
Where were you?

01:15:44.938 --> 01:15:45.940
Hey?

01:15:45.941 --> 01:15:47.035
Where were you?

01:15:47.036 --> 01:15:48.053
It doesn't matter.

01:15:48.054 --> 01:15:49.060
It does matter.

01:15:49.061 --> 01:15:50.058
Where were you?

01:15:50.059 --> 01:15:51.058
Tell me.

01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:54.857
Would you tell me where you were.

01:15:54.858 --> 01:15:56.137
You don't have the right to yell at me.

01:15:56.138 --> 01:15:57.999
I went to get what we needed.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.437
What were you doing?

01:15:59.438 --> 01:16:00.799
Oh yeah, where'd you get it?

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:03.467
Where'd you fucking get it then?

01:16:05.341 --> 01:16:07.780
Tell me where you got it.

01:16:07.781 --> 01:16:08.783
Tell me.

01:16:08.784 --> 01:16:09.781
How do you think I got it, Adam?

01:16:09.782 --> 01:16:11.743
How do you think I fucking got it?

01:16:11.744 --> 01:16:12.761
Don't say that to me.

01:16:12.762 --> 01:16:13.762
I'm sorry.

01:16:14.661 --> 01:16:16.079
Get away from me.

01:16:34.384 --> 01:16:35.216
Fuck off.

01:16:35.217 --> 01:16:36.202
This is mine, not yours.

01:16:36.203 --> 01:16:37.202
Fuck off.

01:16:41.322 --> 01:16:43.137
Get the fuck away.

01:17:48.241 --> 01:17:50.841
Adam, Adam, it's for your own good.

01:17:50.842 --> 01:17:52.324
I'm fine, I'm fine.

01:17:52.325 --> 01:17:53.721
I'm fine.

01:17:53.722 --> 01:17:54.724
Get the fuck off of me, man.

01:17:54.725 --> 01:17:55.801
Dude, check it out.

01:17:55.802 --> 01:17:56.804
Look, we can leave.

01:17:56.805 --> 01:17:57.802
We can go.

01:17:57.803 --> 01:17:58.841
We don't have to hang out
with Shepherd right now.

01:17:58.842 --> 01:18:00.061
We don't have to do this.

01:18:00.062 --> 01:18:01.423
Listen to me.

01:18:01.424 --> 01:18:02.257
I'm fine, everything's cool.

01:18:02.258 --> 01:18:03.181
Listen to me.

01:18:03.182 --> 01:18:04.239
Everything's fine dude.

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:05.597
You need a week

01:18:05.598 --> 01:18:06.655
to get dry and clean.

01:18:06.656 --> 01:18:07.954
You take your shoes off, relax okay.

01:18:07.955 --> 01:18:10.995
Why are you guys doing this to me?

01:18:10.996 --> 01:18:12.596
I'm fine.

01:18:12.597 --> 01:18:13.977
All right, see you at four.

01:18:13.978 --> 01:18:16.336
Keith, what are you doing?

01:18:16.337 --> 01:18:17.519
Why are you doing this?

01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:19.119
I don't want this shit.

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:20.340
Get the fuck off me.

01:18:20.341 --> 01:18:22.100
Get the fuck out of my face.

01:18:22.101 --> 01:18:23.455
And fuck you.

01:18:23.456 --> 01:18:24.956
Fuck me?

01:18:26.458 --> 01:18:28.116
My fucking hair.

01:18:28.117 --> 01:18:30.238
We're fucking trying here.

01:18:30.239 --> 01:18:32.057
I swear to god,

01:18:32.058 --> 01:18:33.316
I will knock your fucking ass out

01:18:33.317 --> 01:18:35.336
and maybe I'll fucking blow your toes off

01:18:35.337 --> 01:18:36.717
for good measure.

01:18:36.718 --> 01:18:37.718
Now man up.

01:18:38.517 --> 01:18:40.517
You ain't going nowhere.

01:18:42.058 --> 01:18:43.279
Don't do this man.

01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:44.820
Don't, don't fucking do this.

01:18:44.821 --> 01:18:46.693
Where's Alice?

01:18:46.694 --> 01:18:48.639
Where's Alice?

01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:49.758
It's for your own good, man.

01:18:49.759 --> 01:18:50.836
Where's Alice?

01:18:50.837 --> 01:18:52.020
Where's Alice?

01:18:52.021 --> 01:18:53.104
Where is she?

01:18:54.757 --> 01:18:56.674
Tell me where Alice is.

01:18:58.096 --> 01:18:59.295
What did I do?

01:18:59.296 --> 01:19:01.054
Yeah, yeah, I feel that.

01:19:01.055 --> 01:19:02.916
Got do what we gotta do, right.

01:19:02.917 --> 01:19:03.917
Okay.

01:19:08.197 --> 01:19:10.255
So you coming in or what?

01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:31.076
I got you.

01:19:31.077 --> 01:19:32.077
I got you.

01:19:38.054 --> 01:19:39.257
You good.

01:19:39.258 --> 01:19:40.508
Is this normal?

01:19:41.701 --> 01:19:43.034
He ain't normal.

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:47.716
I'm gonna annoy the shit out of you.

01:19:47.717 --> 01:19:50.420
But the next time you put
yourself through this,

01:19:50.421 --> 01:19:52.159
you'll remember

01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:55.327
the amount of shit we put you through.

01:20:51.317 --> 01:20:52.596
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:20:52.597 --> 01:20:53.599
Are you all right?

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:55.138
Yeah.

01:20:55.139 --> 01:20:56.722
What's your name?

01:20:58.437 --> 01:20:59.439
Listen, I'm Robert.

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:01.999
I can get some coffee.

01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:08.580
Listen,

01:21:08.581 --> 01:21:10.596
why don't you get in the car.

01:21:10.597 --> 01:21:12.820
We'll go for a drive.

01:21:12.821 --> 01:21:13.821
Get inside.

01:21:15.818 --> 01:21:18.151
You can make a little money.

01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:22.159
That's right.

01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:23.160
Come on.

01:21:31.536 --> 01:21:32.535
Something

01:21:32.536 --> 01:21:33.536
gay maggots

01:21:34.357 --> 01:21:35.357
stop.

01:21:37.115 --> 01:21:38.137
Get out of me.

01:21:38.138 --> 01:21:39.305
Get out of me.

01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:17.461
Put your arm around me.

01:22:17.462 --> 01:22:19.577
Put your arm around me.

01:22:19.578 --> 01:22:20.911
I got you, okay.

01:22:21.801 --> 01:22:22.801
There we go.

01:22:24.378 --> 01:22:25.620
I got you.

01:22:25.621 --> 01:22:26.621
Come on.

01:22:29.978 --> 01:22:33.017
♪ It's such a perfect day. ♪

01:22:33.018 --> 01:22:37.255
♪ I'm glad I spent it with you ♪

01:22:37.256 --> 01:22:39.519
♪ It's such a perfect day ♪

01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:42.441
♪ Hanging out with you, Adam ♪

01:22:42.442 --> 01:22:47.025
♪ You strung out little junkie bastard ♪

01:22:48.602 --> 01:22:50.457
It's almost out of your system.

01:22:50.458 --> 01:22:51.440
Give it a bit of time, and

01:22:51.441 --> 01:22:55.060
if you promise never to do it again,

01:22:55.061 --> 01:22:57.561
I'll sing these songs forever.

01:22:58.480 --> 01:22:59.813
Thanks.

01:23:01.402 --> 01:23:02.985
You poor bastard.

01:23:06.318 --> 01:23:08.340
Do you ever read, Adam?

01:23:08.341 --> 01:23:10.424
Up the road in the shack,

01:23:11.701 --> 01:23:13.256
the old man was sleeping again.

01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:16.683
He was still.

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:19.990
Sleeping on his face.

01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:22.300
And a boy,

01:23:23.759 --> 01:23:26.079
he was sitting there,

01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:27.163
watching him.

01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:31.563
The old man's

01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:34.440
dreaming

01:23:36.122 --> 01:23:37.455
about the lions.

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:42.140
What do you think?

01:23:43.118 --> 01:23:44.677
If you don't like that,

01:23:44.678 --> 01:23:46.761
you don't like ice cream.

01:23:47.802 --> 01:23:50.057
I really like this one.

01:23:50.058 --> 01:23:51.220
So what'd you get?

01:23:51.221 --> 01:23:52.660
Did you dig it?

01:23:52.661 --> 01:23:53.860
What'd you learn?

01:23:53.861 --> 01:23:54.858
To not

01:23:54.859 --> 01:23:56.479
chase a big fish.

01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:59.147
And that Hemingway was a junkie.

01:24:05.882 --> 01:24:07.321
My baby brother.

01:24:07.322 --> 01:24:10.155
Come on kid, you're gonna be okay.

01:24:23.898 --> 01:24:24.898
Mom?

01:24:27.338 --> 01:24:28.338
Wake up.

01:24:30.218 --> 01:24:31.301
Mom, wake up.

01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:38.530
Please wake up.

01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:47.170
Please wake up.

01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:56.137
Mangia, mangia.

01:24:56.138 --> 01:24:57.138
Here we go.

01:24:58.138 --> 01:24:59.636
Grab that towel, would ya.

01:24:59.637 --> 01:25:00.937
Oh, yeah.

01:25:00.938 --> 01:25:02.319
Don't want to fuck my table up.

01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:04.294
You're welcome kid.

01:25:04.295 --> 01:25:05.295
Enjoy.

01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:10.080
Hey, where's Keith at?

01:25:12.854 --> 01:25:14.521
Keith's at school.

01:25:18.378 --> 01:25:19.961
It's the weekend.

01:25:21.219 --> 01:25:22.937
It's Saturday.

01:25:22.938 --> 01:25:24.478
It's graduation day.

01:25:24.479 --> 01:25:25.729
That's today?

01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:29.357
Yeah, that was today?

01:25:31.675 --> 01:25:32.675
Fuck.

01:25:34.087 --> 01:25:35.087
Look,

01:25:39.461 --> 01:25:40.846
don't worry about it.

01:25:40.847 --> 01:25:42.329
You're gonna find your own journey.

01:25:42.330 --> 01:25:43.330
It's cool.

01:25:44.346 --> 01:25:45.348
All right?

01:25:45.349 --> 01:25:46.489
You get soup, get strong,

01:25:46.490 --> 01:25:47.490
that's good.

01:25:48.389 --> 01:25:51.385
Do you want to hear a story?

01:25:51.386 --> 01:25:52.886
Is it Hemingway?

01:25:54.106 --> 01:25:55.209
Not quite.

01:25:55.210 --> 01:25:56.210
Chapter one.

01:25:57.546 --> 01:25:59.625
There was this dickhead
who came to my house

01:25:59.626 --> 01:26:01.209
and shat and pissed

01:26:02.330 --> 01:26:04.706
and crapped in my bed,

01:26:04.707 --> 01:26:06.265
and on my floors.

01:26:06.266 --> 01:26:07.689
And while he was doing that,

01:26:07.690 --> 01:26:10.569
I did my very best to keep
that little fucker clean.

01:26:10.570 --> 01:26:13.861
Me and Nikki's mom fell in love

01:26:13.862 --> 01:26:15.486
when we were young,

01:26:15.487 --> 01:26:16.487
very young.

01:26:18.767 --> 01:26:20.184
She got pregnant.

01:26:23.845 --> 01:26:26.928
My beautiful little Nikki came along.

01:26:28.127 --> 01:26:31.744
Five years we tried playing house,

01:26:31.745 --> 01:26:33.588
happy family, and all that.

01:26:33.589 --> 01:26:34.589
But,

01:26:37.685 --> 01:26:39.108
I was too young, man.

01:26:44.927 --> 01:26:47.405
So I just pack my bag one night.

01:26:47.406 --> 01:26:48.906
And I was leaving.

01:26:50.410 --> 01:26:53.577
And Nikki said to me the night before,

01:26:54.447 --> 01:26:58.446
Daddy, will you take me
to the beach tomorrow.

01:26:58.447 --> 01:27:00.947
And I said of course, darling.

01:27:03.429 --> 01:27:04.649
Promise.

01:27:04.650 --> 01:27:07.027
Promise, I promise.

01:27:07.028 --> 01:27:09.529
My last memory of her.

01:27:09.530 --> 01:27:12.430
She was sitting on the couch

01:27:12.431 --> 01:27:13.681
in this little,

01:27:19.951 --> 01:27:21.951
a little polka dot suit,

01:27:29.205 --> 01:27:31.038
waiting for her daddy.

01:27:36.346 --> 01:27:37.346
Any man

01:27:38.303 --> 01:27:40.303
that does that to a kid,

01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:45.137
well he ain't no fucking man.

01:27:53.903 --> 01:27:54.986
Look at that.

01:27:57.743 --> 01:27:59.243
That now, my boys,

01:28:00.485 --> 01:28:02.425
is what you call

01:28:02.426 --> 01:28:03.926
fucking beautiful.

01:28:06.245 --> 01:28:07.764
Here, this is a treat.

01:28:07.765 --> 01:28:10.598
Don't go crazy you little bastard.

01:28:16.515 --> 01:28:17.637
Oh, no, I quit.

01:28:17.638 --> 01:28:20.277
Caroline's not into that.

01:28:29.594 --> 01:28:32.436
I haven't heard from Alice at all.

01:28:32.437 --> 01:28:33.452
I tried calling her.

01:28:33.453 --> 01:28:34.938
I tried.

01:28:34.939 --> 01:28:36.634
She won't return my texts.

01:28:36.635 --> 01:28:40.197
I have heard from Alice in weeks.

01:28:40.198 --> 01:28:41.698
I don't expect to.

01:28:42.998 --> 01:28:44.938
It's just what she does.

01:28:44.939 --> 01:28:46.495
Next guy comes along,

01:28:46.496 --> 01:28:47.746
she disappears.

01:28:48.915 --> 01:28:49.915
Listen,

01:28:50.736 --> 01:28:53.429
I think I can help her.

01:28:53.430 --> 01:28:56.013
I mean like you guys helped me.

01:28:58.395 --> 01:28:59.877
You think you can help her?

01:28:59.878 --> 01:29:01.135
Yeah.

01:29:01.136 --> 01:29:04.356
Do you think I didn't try to help her

01:29:04.357 --> 01:29:05.834
all these years?

01:29:05.835 --> 01:29:08.585
She ain't done until she is done.

01:29:11.034 --> 01:29:13.258
It's just the way it is.

01:29:13.259 --> 01:29:14.256
And until then,

01:29:14.257 --> 01:29:16.506
there's nothing you can do.

01:29:18.438 --> 01:29:19.834
I'm out.

01:29:19.835 --> 01:29:20.835
Nice job.

01:29:22.816 --> 01:29:23.816
Good luck.

01:29:25.696 --> 01:29:27.957
Thanks, Shep.

01:29:46.358 --> 01:29:47.525
Adam, honey.

01:29:48.493 --> 01:29:49.513
Aunt Julie,

01:29:49.514 --> 01:29:50.975
what are you doing here?

01:29:50.976 --> 01:29:53.797
I'm so glad you're home.

01:29:53.798 --> 01:29:56.678
Come in, I need to talk
to you about something.

01:29:56.679 --> 01:29:58.437
Is everything okay?

01:29:58.438 --> 01:29:59.438
Yeah.

01:30:22.496 --> 01:30:23.496
Hey mom.

01:30:29.238 --> 01:30:30.821
It's gonna be okay.

01:30:33.755 --> 01:30:35.338
It's gonna be okay.

01:30:37.115 --> 01:30:38.115
Hey.

01:30:48.472 --> 01:30:52.677
Hey, I'll be right here if you need me.

01:30:52.678 --> 01:30:54.538
Thanks man.

01:31:10.976 --> 01:31:11.976
Alice?

01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:15.240
Alice.

01:31:18.198 --> 01:31:19.948
You're trespassing.

01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:24.600
Alice.

01:31:26.598 --> 01:31:27.598
I got clean.

01:31:31.613 --> 01:31:34.196
Shep and Keith, they helped me.

01:31:36.096 --> 01:31:38.096
I came back to help you.

01:31:40.598 --> 01:31:42.138
You can't live like this Alice.

01:31:42.139 --> 01:31:44.011
Please, come with me.

01:31:44.012 --> 01:31:46.113
You can't be here anymore.

01:31:46.114 --> 01:31:47.114
Alice,

01:31:50.118 --> 01:31:52.433
please come with me.

01:31:52.434 --> 01:31:53.795
I love you.

01:31:53.796 --> 01:31:55.839
I never loved you.

01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:56.840
What?

01:31:58.576 --> 01:32:00.826
How can you say that to me?

01:32:02.096 --> 01:32:04.513
I was just a story for you.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:07.018
No.

01:32:07.019 --> 01:32:08.055
Uh huh.

01:32:08.056 --> 01:32:09.738
No.

01:32:09.739 --> 01:32:12.322
Did you tell people about me?

01:32:13.599 --> 01:32:15.974
Tell them what?

01:32:15.975 --> 01:32:18.225
What are you talking about?

01:32:26.857 --> 01:32:30.298
I will carry her heart with me,

01:32:30.299 --> 01:32:32.466
my broken, beautiful soul,

01:32:35.136 --> 01:32:36.136
my runaway.

01:32:39.518 --> 01:32:41.101
I see myself in her

01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:43.403
like a mirror

01:32:48.678 --> 01:32:51.345
that I'm both afraid to look at,

01:32:52.598 --> 01:32:55.015
and afraid to look away from.

01:32:59.456 --> 01:33:00.623
She's damaged.

01:33:03.376 --> 01:33:04.626
Keep reading.

01:33:07.179 --> 01:33:09.375
Don't you get it, Alice?

01:33:09.376 --> 01:33:11.199
I wrote you in here.

01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:13.039
I wrote about me and us.

01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:15.123
It's because I loved you.

01:33:18.699 --> 01:33:20.032
Let me help you.

01:33:24.058 --> 01:33:25.058
Get out.

01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:27.738
No.

01:33:27.739 --> 01:33:28.739
Get out.

01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:31.039
Get out.

01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:32.399
Get out.

01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:33.976
Get out.

01:33:33.977 --> 01:33:34.977
Get out.

01:33:37.462 --> 01:33:38.879
Get the fuck out.

01:33:39.739 --> 01:33:43.156
I don't want to see you anymore, go away.

01:33:45.099 --> 01:33:47.141
Get the fuck out.

01:33:47.142 --> 01:33:48.392
Go on, get out.

01:33:50.981 --> 01:33:51.981
Get out.

01:34:04.102 --> 01:34:05.102
Hey,

01:34:08.742 --> 01:34:09.742
hey Adam.

01:34:15.739 --> 01:34:16.739
Adam?

01:34:21.098 --> 01:34:22.098
Adam?

01:34:23.378 --> 01:34:24.878
Oh no, no, no, no.

01:35:39.615 --> 01:35:40.782
Here you go.

01:35:49.551 --> 01:35:50.551
Jesus.

01:35:55.471 --> 01:35:56.888
Hey dad.

01:35:58.828 --> 01:35:59.828
Hey.

01:36:01.309 --> 01:36:02.392
I wanted to

01:36:03.813 --> 01:36:05.614
stop by and thank you for the bike.

01:36:05.615 --> 01:36:07.032
You're welcome.

01:36:08.334 --> 01:36:11.011
Look, I'm gonna go
away for a little while.

01:36:11.012 --> 01:36:12.368
I just got to,

01:36:12.369 --> 01:36:14.873
I got to figure my life out.

01:36:14.874 --> 01:36:17.041
Sure, I get that.

01:36:18.212 --> 01:36:19.212
Cool.

01:36:20.095 --> 01:36:21.790
I'll see you later, dad.

01:36:21.791 --> 01:36:22.791
Okay.

01:36:25.378 --> 01:36:26.438
Hey,

01:36:26.439 --> 01:36:27.596
Adam.

01:36:27.597 --> 01:36:29.217
Yeah?

01:36:29.218 --> 01:36:31.019
Be safe, will you?

01:36:31.020 --> 01:36:32.497
I will.

01:36:34.738 --> 01:36:36.321
You should go home.

01:36:37.197 --> 01:36:38.497
Okay.

01:36:38.498 --> 01:36:39.498
I will.

01:36:43.997 --> 01:36:45.330
That was my kid.

01:36:46.941 --> 01:36:47.938
Yeah?

01:36:47.939 --> 01:36:49.176
You believe it.

01:36:53.378 --> 01:36:54.394
Hey buddy.

01:36:54.395 --> 01:36:56.395
I got a present for you.

01:36:57.778 --> 01:36:59.660
Space Mountain.

01:36:59.661 --> 01:37:01.494
This is for you, okay.

01:37:02.679 --> 01:37:03.693
But you got to promise me

01:37:03.694 --> 01:37:04.956
that you take pictures, all right.

01:37:04.957 --> 01:37:05.958
I will.

01:37:05.959 --> 01:37:07.542
I'll take pictures.

01:37:09.457 --> 01:37:12.539
You know, you're gonna be
a great astronaut someday.

01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:14.380
I'm gonna see you on TV

01:37:14.381 --> 01:37:15.548
flying around.

01:37:17.117 --> 01:37:18.940
Don't be sad, it's gonna be okay.

01:37:18.941 --> 01:37:20.314
All right.

01:37:20.315 --> 01:37:22.220
I love you buddy.

01:37:22.221 --> 01:37:24.138
I love you too.

01:37:50.953 --> 01:37:51.956
Still got it.

01:37:59.399 --> 01:38:01.399
See you, Keith.

01:38:03.101 --> 01:38:06.257
Where the fuck
did you get that piece of shit?

01:38:06.258 --> 01:38:07.296
My dad gave it to me.

01:38:07.297 --> 01:38:10.232
Be careful on this thing.

01:38:10.233 --> 01:38:11.233
You realize

01:38:12.895 --> 01:38:15.513
to keep the rubber down on the ground.

01:38:15.514 --> 01:38:17.264
I'd hate to lose you.

01:38:20.193 --> 01:38:21.473
I'm very fond of you.

01:38:21.474 --> 01:38:22.557
