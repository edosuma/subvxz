37:24.209 --> 37:27.209
Look, I don't know what this
is about, and I don't care.

37:27.237 --> 37:28.637
You got what you wanted.

37:28.667 --> 37:30.709
The two of us? We're done.

37:30.740 --> 37:33.041
We're done when I say we're done.

37:33.076 --> 37:34.943
Don't make me remind you again.

37:45.188 --> 37:47.589
[SIGHS]

37:52.328 --> 37:54.963
It's nice to see that
rock back where it belongs.

37:54.998 --> 37:56.698
So I guess you and Chad...?

37:56.733 --> 37:59.902
He knows almost
everything at this point.

37:59.936 --> 38:03.205
Minus the fairy tale bits.

38:03.250 --> 38:05.667
And somehow, he still
wants to be with me.

38:07.043 --> 38:09.645
There's one thing I
haven't told him yet.

38:09.679 --> 38:10.913
What's that?

38:10.947 --> 38:13.633
That I have to stay here with you.

38:13.667 --> 38:16.876
You need my help curing
Henry and breaking the curse.

38:19.055 --> 38:20.355
I'll manage.

38:20.390 --> 38:23.091
You came when I needed you.

38:23.126 --> 38:27.729
Kelly deserves a little happiness.

38:27.751 --> 38:30.043
[SIGHS] And so does Zelena.

38:36.209 --> 38:39.710
[VOICE BREAKING] So go on, you monkey.

38:39.982 --> 38:45.487
You get on that bike and fly.

38:50.086 --> 38:52.087
[DOOR OPENS]

38:54.257 --> 38:56.291
Why does that look like a goodbye hug?

38:56.326 --> 38:58.927
Hey, Margot.

39:02.999 --> 39:05.634
I don't know what
Detective Rogers told you,

39:05.667 --> 39:08.876
but there are some things
I need to tell you about me.

39:08.905 --> 39:11.039
I know all I need to know.

39:11.447 --> 39:12.947
You do?

39:12.972 --> 39:14.376
You have a past.

39:14.410 --> 39:16.111
Someone doesn't try to be that zen

39:16.145 --> 39:18.981
unless they're covering up
for some shady crap they did.

39:19.015 --> 39:20.949
So what was it?

39:21.000 --> 39:23.037
Spy? Assassin?

39:23.038 --> 39:24.720
A crime boss?

39:24.754 --> 39:25.888
Crime boss. I knew it.

39:25.922 --> 39:28.624
I promise it will make sense very soon.

39:29.540 --> 39:31.775
Wait. What's going on?

39:32.015 --> 39:34.963
Chad and I are going
back to San Francisco.

39:34.998 --> 39:36.164
Do you want to come with us?

39:37.883 --> 39:40.002
Actually...

39:40.036 --> 39:41.970
I'm kind of digging Hype Town now.

39:42.005 --> 39:43.445
Really?

39:44.172 --> 39:46.842
I met someone I wouldn't
mind sticking around for.

39:48.022 --> 39:50.312
Well, I'm all for you
making new friends.

39:50.346 --> 39:51.813
Especially cute blond ones.

39:51.848 --> 39:53.815
Okay, can we please not jinx this?

39:53.850 --> 39:56.249
It's still really early.

39:56.374 --> 39:57.519
I'm gonna miss you.

39:57.554 --> 39:59.021
Mom, seriously.

39:59.055 --> 40:00.622
It's like a 90-minute flight.

40:00.657 --> 40:02.934
Plus I'll see you in a
couple months for the wedding.

40:02.959 --> 40:05.027
Yes. You will.

40:05.061 --> 40:08.263
Speaking of...

40:08.298 --> 40:09.932
Here.

40:09.966 --> 40:12.067
This is an old family heirloom.

40:15.138 --> 40:17.940
I'd like for you to wear
it as my maid of honor.

40:19.362 --> 40:21.276
Really?

40:22.879 --> 40:26.048
Margot...

40:26.083 --> 40:31.001
Any happiness I have,
it all began with you.

40:44.042 --> 40:46.042
[ELECTRICITY CRACKLES]

40:51.334 --> 40:52.960
Finally.

40:53.009 --> 40:54.676
I was wondering how long you
guys would leave me in here.

40:54.711 --> 40:56.678
[DOOR CLOSES]

40:57.353 --> 40:59.787
But who are you? My lawyer?

41:00.950 --> 41:04.586
Actually, more of a patron.

41:05.097 --> 41:09.867
Haven't you been wondering
all this time who woke you up?

41:11.127 --> 41:12.995
You?

41:14.120 --> 41:15.820
But why?

41:16.081 --> 41:19.034
I knew about your witch agenda,

41:19.068 --> 41:20.869
and I thought you might take care

41:20.903 --> 41:23.005
of a few of them for me.

41:23.039 --> 41:25.340
Especially one who's
in competition with me

41:25.375 --> 41:27.719
for the Dark One's power.

41:28.688 --> 41:31.546
I believe you know her as Mother Gothel.

41:33.292 --> 41:37.084
Yeah, I know her. She's my grand prize.

41:37.120 --> 41:39.855
I want to make her suffer
for what she did my sister.

41:39.889 --> 41:41.857
You had your chance.

41:42.185 --> 41:45.027
You could have had her whole coven.

41:45.061 --> 41:47.095
But you got caught.

41:48.959 --> 41:50.918
Listen, I-I can still help you.

41:50.967 --> 41:53.602
Just use your dark magic,
whatever, get me out of here,

41:53.636 --> 41:55.937
and I'll kill any witch you like.

41:57.507 --> 42:00.976
Sorry, boy. You're a wild card.

42:06.292 --> 42:08.626
And I'm taking you out of the deck.

42:11.501 --> 42:12.918
