WEBVTT

06:57.200 --> 07:00.590
All ofthe above.
Captain, let me know if you like it.

07:05.199 --> 07:08.271
He's not used to having
guests on board.

07:08.479 --> 07:11.789
He's a special guy,
he's all brains.

07:11.999 --> 07:15.992
He's writing the speech l'll present
for Grimaldi at the convention.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.195
He's not a relationship kind of guy,

07:19.360 --> 07:22.670
he's been on board
for 4 years straight, no vacations.

07:23.640 --> 07:27.155
So what ’2 He's got no family,
no kids, it's easy.

07:27.319 --> 07:31.710
l have three kids, all girls,
but the next might be a boy.

07:31.879 --> 07:35.155
I hope so. Can I have one ’2

07:38.079 --> 07:40.673
- Here.
- Thanks, it's nice.

07:41.880 --> 07:45.111
What does that mediocre singer
want from me ’2

07:45.279 --> 07:48.351
Always flapping his gums,
quit fucking talking !

08:18.960 --> 08:20.154
Mayl’?

08:28.559 --> 08:30.834
1 minute, 19 seconds, damn it !

08:31.000 --> 08:32.194
Hello ’?

08:33.039 --> 08:35.951
Chiaromonte ! What is it ’2

08:36.160 --> 08:38.720
- You finished my speech ’2
- No.

08:38.919 --> 08:41.308
- It's something else.
- What ’?

08:42.640 --> 08:46.189
The company wants me to disembark
in Montevideo

08:46.320 --> 08:49.710
and take my vacation days,
even past unused ones.

08:49.880 --> 08:51.233
It's only right...

08:52.959 --> 08:56.952
- I can't be on land for 8 months.
- Vacation is obligatory.

08:57.759 --> 09:01.468
You need to get offthis ship,
it's been 4 years.

09:01.639 --> 09:05.598
- Captain, help me.
- How can I convince the company ’2

09:05.760 --> 09:08.115
You're becoming an issue.

09:08.279 --> 09:10.509
Is a chef who doesn't want
to disembark worse than

09:12.479 --> 09:14.709
Chiaromonte, how dare you !

09:15.359 --> 09:16.712
No phobia.

09:16.920 --> 09:19.115
These are precautionary measures.

09:20.480 --> 09:23.199
- 1 minute, 19 seconds isn't enough.
- No ’2

09:23.360 --> 09:26.318
Especially if you're stuck
in your cabin while the ship sinks.

09:26.880 --> 09:29.872
If you can't kick out the porthole
the water will rise...

09:30.359 --> 09:31.314
Enough.

09:31.520 --> 09:33.636
The captain's the last
to leave the ship...

09:33.800 --> 09:35.916
Enough, Chiaromonte.

09:37.640 --> 09:39.517
I'm working on my phobia.

09:41.200 --> 09:44.272
- Unfortunately, the sea is my passion.
- I know.

09:45.319 --> 09:49.073
- I'll try to get you reinstated.
- Thanks.

09:51.040 --> 09:53.474
What you saw here stays between us.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.875
- Hook, line, and sinker.
- Bad pun.

09:56.039 --> 09:57.313
Sorry.

10:00.120 --> 10:02.395
Who are we, where are we from,
where are we going ?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.195
But above all, how will we get back ?

10:05.400 --> 10:06.833
Where will we go back to ?

10:07.000 --> 10:10.913
Setting sail is a passage,
you forgo bonds and pursue memories

10:11.079 --> 10:12.876
while awaiting landfall.

10:13.039 --> 10:16.429
Does landfall really exist ?
I don't think so.

10:16.559 --> 10:19.710
You must adjust to the void
in order to remain afloat.

10:19.879 --> 10:21.995
Many things are missed,

10:22.200 --> 10:24.839
but the imagination
must be kindled

10:24.999 --> 10:28.150
in order to extract some happiness
from the void.

10:30.160 --> 10:34.676
While at sea, even thoughts of women
find their way in

10:34.799 --> 10:37.108
and make us feel their absence.

10:37.280 --> 10:41.159
But we don't consider masturbation
to be a stopgap.

10:42.160 --> 10:43.957
Masturbation ’?

10:44.120 --> 10:48.033
It's really great, but mentioning
masturbation in the speech...

10:48.920 --> 10:51.718
Excuse me,
do you not masturbate ’?

10:51.960 --> 10:54.838
To be honest, not much.

10:54.959 --> 10:57.837
You should do it more, much more.

10:58.199 --> 11:00.918
lt releases endorphins,
neurotransmitters

11:01.119 --> 11:03.189
of happiness.

11:07.319 --> 11:09.275
Thanks, Calogero.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.350
I'd start with two a day.

11:12.519 --> 11:14.828
- Seems excessive.
- No l

11:15.000 --> 11:18.072
To be frank,
l jerk off once a day still.

11:18.240 --> 11:20.754
Butt out, we're talking about biology.

11:20.959 --> 11:25.350
- Jerking off isn't rocket science.
- You're so unpleasant.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.036
Chill out I

11:29.239 --> 11:31.309
And watch your mouth !

11:32.799 --> 11:34.790
Hey ! Ruggero !

11:35.560 --> 11:38.677
Ask Mr. Cristofori to come see
you guysjam,

11:38.840 --> 11:42.355
you could get a professional opinion,
he's a producer.

11:42.519 --> 11:44.589
Yeah... of vulgarity.

11:54.199 --> 11:58.033
l have to admit,
I have a passion for singing too.

12:03.840 --> 12:05.353
What do you think ’2

12:36.879 --> 12:39.871
Three daughters.
That takes true grit.

12:40.040 --> 12:41.951
They'll keep you on your toes.

12:42.119 --> 12:44.155
It's tough. And you ’2

12:44.639 --> 12:47.153
- Kids ’?
- That's the last thing I need !

12:48.959 --> 12:50.711
You hurt me !

12:51.040 --> 12:53.759
I didn't do anything,
it's the hairdryer.

12:53.920 --> 12:56.275
- Damn hairdryer.
- It's normal.

12:59.480 --> 13:02.358
Breathtaking island you are

13:03.760 --> 13:07.639
A mild climate embraces me

13:09.920 --> 13:12.480
Lots of reeds and bamboo...

13:12.639 --> 13:14.357
That's tough.

13:19.839 --> 13:24.355
Lying in the sun dwing off
body and face

13:26.079 --> 13:28.912
I look Paradise in the face

13:29.120 --> 13:31.429
Wave upon wave

13:32.159 --> 13:34.992
The sea has brought me here

13:35.199 --> 13:39.511
Rhythm, songs
Dreamy women

13:39.719 --> 13:44.076
Bananas and raspberries
Wave upon wave

13:44.680 --> 13:47.240
By now I've acclimatized

13:47.640 --> 13:51.474
A shipwreck gave me
the happiness that you...

13:53.240 --> 13:55.754
Never gave me

14:00.799 --> 14:02.517
All together, guys !

14:02.719 --> 14:07.235
We rehearsed 200,000 times.
For Christ's sake !

14:09.160 --> 14:11.276
Thanks, thank you.

14:11.839 --> 14:13.397
Thanks.

14:13.680 --> 14:18.231
We'll take a 5 minute break.
Hit up this lavish buffet.

14:19.119 --> 14:21.428
Go ahead, attack !

14:44.560 --> 14:46.630
What are you doing in here ’2

14:46.799 --> 14:48.551
Looking for food.

14:48.759 --> 14:52.434
I didn't eat a bite at the party,
I woke up famished.

14:52.639 --> 14:55.915
You're not allowed in the kitchen
or the refrigerator.

14:56.080 --> 14:59.038
| just want a few eggs,
l'll cook them myself.

14:59.240 --> 15:02.835
The door must stay shut
or the cold airwill escape.

15:05.480 --> 15:07.391
Tell me where the darn eggs are.

15:07.599 --> 15:11.956
- l'll close you in.
- Go ahead, I won't have to hear you.

15:13.119 --> 15:14.996
Fuck!

15:16.359 --> 15:18.395
Where are the darn eggs ’2

15:20.800 --> 15:22.711
So fucking cold !

15:26.000 --> 15:29.231
Where are the eggs ’2 I can't find them.

15:31.440 --> 15:32.668
Open the door !

15:34.199 --> 15:37.589
Open the fucking door,
l'm freezing !

15:39.519 --> 15:41.316
You're an asshole !

15:43.800 --> 15:44.915
Open up !

15:45.480 --> 15:47.755
Open this fucking door !

15:55.759 --> 15:57.636
Mr. Cristofori...

15:59.560 --> 16:01.437
your eggs.

16:15.760 --> 16:18.354
We keep them in the mini fridge.

16:25.119 --> 16:29.078
Are you a wannabe ballerina
or ashamed of your height ’2

16:39.319 --> 16:41.150
One's enough.

16:46.239 --> 16:50.073
Looks like a severe inflammation,
but the satellite images are bluml.

16:50.240 --> 16:53.118
Keep taking the anti-inflammatories
the captain gave you.

16:53.280 --> 16:55.555
And go see a throat specialist soon.

16:55.719 --> 16:58.517
- Captain, how's the phobia ?
- Thanks, doc.

16:58.680 --> 17:01.399
l've closed the session,
close your mouth.

17:05.679 --> 17:07.431
- Thanks.
- For what ’2

17:07.600 --> 17:10.717
- For making me lose my voice.
- It was his own fault.

17:10.879 --> 17:14.508
He left me in the refrigerator
for over 30 minutes !

17:14.680 --> 17:17.877
You went in on your own
plus the eggs weren't in there.

17:18.039 --> 17:19.950
- Why didn't you tell me ’2
- Did you ask ’2

17:20.119 --> 17:22.792
- Yes !
- He threw an egg at me too.

17:22.959 --> 17:25.234
- You're maddening !
- He tried to hurt me !

17:25.400 --> 17:28.517
- You're maddening !
- Will you knock it off ’2

17:28.680 --> 17:32.150
Good thing we're arriving
in Montevideo a day early.

17:32.320 --> 17:34.117
No more fighting.

17:34.439 --> 17:38.068
Don't you get it ’2
Violence will get you nowhere.

17:38.800 --> 17:41.189
- Make up and kiss.
- No...

17:42.320 --> 17:44.117
-Hug’?
-No...

17:44.280 --> 17:45.713
- Group hug.
- No.

17:45.880 --> 17:48.633
lt'll make us all feel better,
group hug.

17:49.160 --> 17:50.275
Come on.

17:50.440 --> 17:54.956
I just want to sing
because I feel a shiver in my...

17:55.960 --> 17:59.032
- How's it going ’2
- I can't hit any high notes.

17:59.200 --> 18:01.714
Come inside, it's windy out here.

18:21.639 --> 18:23.277
Service ! Service !

18:39.040 --> 18:41.031
In South America. Hear me ’2

18:55.679 --> 18:58.239
What are you cooking, mom ’2

18:58.959 --> 19:01.029
How's mom, okay ’2

19:02.760 --> 19:04.159
It's a girl.

19:04.960 --> 19:06.279
Again...

20:04.079 --> 20:05.637
Done ’2 Let's go.

20:05.799 --> 20:07.596
You're taking me there ’2

20:07.800 --> 20:10.712
We drew straws
and I got the shortest one.

20:10.879 --> 20:13.552
- How'll we get there ’2
- By foot, it's nearby.

20:41.879 --> 20:46.475
His office is occupied so Dr. Perez
will ask some questions here.

20:46.640 --> 20:49.473
- He's the specialist ’?
- Yes, Dr. Perez.

20:51.239 --> 20:53.434
Do you like Uruguay ’2

20:53.599 --> 20:56.591
Wejust got here,
I'll get back to you on that.

20:58.320 --> 20:59.833
Go to him.

21:20.959 --> 21:23.075
Let me know
when you're done chitchatting.

21:23.239 --> 21:26.231
He said your throat's inflamed
like a volcano erupting hot pepper.

21:26.439 --> 21:28.828
So I asked what kind of hot pepper.

21:30.999 --> 21:33.559
- Have you strained yourvoice ’?
- Of course.

21:33.720 --> 21:36.757
An asshole locked me
in a refrigerator for over 30 minutes.

21:36.919 --> 21:39.069
You went in but the eggs weren't there.

21:39.240 --> 21:42.232
- You could've told me !
- No, because...

21:42.439 --> 21:45.192
- You should've told me.
- You didn't give me the chance to.

21:46.120 --> 21:48.588
Honey, see you at home later.

21:48.720 --> 21:50.676
All right, see you.

21:51.199 --> 21:52.314
Like Uruguay ’2

21:52.519 --> 21:54.555
I'm still figuring it out.

21:54.960 --> 21:56.234
Bye.

22:04.159 --> 22:07.469
He asked if you've had recent
hospitalizations or illnesses...

22:07.640 --> 22:11.394
Enough, | just want to know
when I'll get my voice back.

22:11.639 --> 22:13.834
He's just asking
about your medical history.

22:14.039 --> 22:16.633
They do it in Italy too,
it's not a Uruguayan fad.

22:16.800 --> 22:18.995
- Am I supposed to laugh ’2
- No, just answer.

22:22.039 --> 22:25.190
Nothing serious,
I was just hospitalized last year.

22:25.399 --> 22:27.310
What for ’2

22:30.160 --> 22:33.948
Stomach pumping
for overdose of psychotropics.

22:34.960 --> 22:37.235
l was a bit burnt out.

22:37.399 --> 22:39.310
You tried to kill yourself ’2

22:43.319 --> 22:44.718
Come along.

23:03.519 --> 23:06.352
I heard there's an Italian
market nearby.

23:06.520 --> 23:10.354
I could buy bacon and make
some pasta to boost your morale.

23:10.520 --> 23:15.548
Screw pasta,
I need money, l have to do this show.

23:15.720 --> 23:19.713
Your vocal cords swollen,
your voice won't be coming back soon.

23:21.319 --> 23:24.117
l have to find someone
to do it for me.

23:31.199 --> 23:33.235
Where'll | find another singer ’?

23:33.359 --> 23:36.237
All he has to do
is say he's Gege Cristofori.

23:36.399 --> 23:39.277
Nobody knows me,
l was in Montevideo 30 years ago.

23:39.480 --> 23:43.155
Anyone could be Gege Cristofori.
Him... or him...

23:45.119 --> 23:49.476
Montevideo is rather European,
much like Paris in its grandeur.

23:49.639 --> 23:52.756
- Your fucking point ’2
- You could use these days...

23:52.919 --> 23:55.797
before you have to leave
to go sightseeing.

23:56.559 --> 24:01.349
You go sightseeing !
I came here to sing, not to sightsee.

24:01.520 --> 24:04.956
It's your fault I can't sing,
so here's a tip for you:

24:05.319 --> 24:07.469
don't speak another word to me.

24:11.479 --> 24:15.074
One last word to tell you
the port's in the other direction.

24:27.799 --> 24:29.949
- That way ’2
- That way.

24:56.759 --> 24:59.193
- Nice car.
- Really nice.

24:59.639 --> 25:02.073
It belongs to a billionaire
who has 1,400,

25:02.279 --> 25:04.998
we bring him a new one every trip.

25:05.159 --> 25:07.593
To think he probably
never even sits in them.

25:07.759 --> 25:11.468
Tomorrow I meet the promoters,
I'll have to call it off.

25:11.639 --> 25:15.188
- No concert, no money.
- It's not that tragic.

25:15.400 --> 25:18.836
Since singing's no longer
your main occupation.

25:18.960 --> 25:21.474
You produce
and have a recording studio.

25:22.000 --> 25:26.391
I don't have a recording studio,
I haven't had shit for years.

25:29.599 --> 25:31.635
Know what I could use now ’2

25:32.559 --> 25:34.709
Some wind in my face.

25:55.520 --> 25:57.431
Where to ’2

25:57.599 --> 26:00.113
Sometimes you go further
by not moving.

26:15.159 --> 26:17.195
Ed Rush, I remember this.

26:17.439 --> 26:19.316
Not my cup of tea...

26:19.439 --> 26:21.669
Hejust lip-synched,
that's my voice.

26:21.840 --> 26:23.159
What 7

26:23.319 --> 26:25.230
Me and a buddy wrote the song.

26:25.400 --> 26:28.631
A producer heard it
and went crazy for it but...

26:28.799 --> 26:32.075
he said my face wasn't right,
I didn't have the right look,

26:32.240 --> 26:36.279
so he called in Edoardo Russo,
a tone-deaf model

26:36.440 --> 26:39.637
and he launched him as Ed Rush.

26:39.800 --> 26:41.916
He was on TV, l was at home.

26:42.919 --> 26:46.116
I tried again,
I managed to sell a fewtunes but...

26:47.280 --> 26:49.510
they never let me go public.

26:50.480 --> 26:52.550
- I'm sorry.
- What can I do ’2

26:53.720 --> 26:57.508
- You'll find a way.
- I won't be hiding out on a ship.

26:58.519 --> 27:01.556
Don't try to tell me
that's your vocation.

27:01.719 --> 27:03.835
Something happened to you.

27:06.040 --> 27:09.271
Things were going well
and then something happened.

27:10.680 --> 27:14.389
And everyone started looking at me
in a different way.

27:14.999 --> 27:17.354
What on earth did you do ’2

27:17.520 --> 27:19.511
- Nothing.
- Did you defend yourself ’2

27:19.679 --> 27:20.828
No.

27:20.999 --> 27:22.830
What did you do ’2

27:24.680 --> 27:26.750
Nothing, nothing.

27:27.359 --> 27:28.428
Bravo.

27:28.560 --> 27:30.471
Atta boy.

28:03.959 --> 28:05.187
Thanks!

28:35.839 --> 28:38.512
- Excuse me, are you Italian ’2
- Yes.

28:38.719 --> 28:40.118
Me too, a bit...

28:40.279 --> 28:42.554
I'm lost, I'm looking for
Mr. Cristofori.

28:42.720 --> 28:44.836
He was on this ship, is he here ’2

28:45.040 --> 28:49.556
I'm the concert promoter.
I mean, lwish, I'm not in charge.

28:49.719 --> 28:53.029
But if anything goes wrong
I'm the one who gets fired.

28:53.240 --> 28:56.118
We were to meet here,
they wouldn't let me drive in.

28:56.480 --> 28:59.756
Maybe he went ashore and I missed him.
For me, Gege Cristofori

28:59.959 --> 29:01.915
could be anyone and...

29:02.079 --> 29:05.867
- So you've never seen him ’2
- No, wejust spoke on the phone.

29:06.039 --> 29:09.429
I even looked online
for photos of him for the poster

29:09.599 --> 29:12.636
but found nothing.
Maybe he's still in his cabin ’?

29:12.839 --> 29:14.909
Doubt it. Come with me.

29:22.319 --> 29:23.991
He knows where to find him.

29:24.599 --> 29:28.433
I'd like to introduce you to...
Gege Cristofori's manager.

29:30.439 --> 29:32.555
I didn't know his managerwas coming.

29:32.719 --> 29:34.118
Always.

29:34.280 --> 29:35.508
Hello !

29:36.520 --> 29:39.637
l'm Gilda Mandarino,
the concert promoter,

29:40.239 --> 29:42.833
well not exactly,
but it doesn't matter.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.433
Where's Mr. Cristofori ’?

29:46.240 --> 29:47.719
Where...

29:48.359 --> 29:50.077
Gege Cristofori...

29:50.240 --> 29:51.639
is me.

29:54.080 --> 29:56.594
- Why didn't you say so ’2
- Well...

29:57.119 --> 29:59.155
Because I don't feel sure about myself.

29:59.280 --> 30:02.238
| always wonderwho I am,
what I'm doing here...

30:03.079 --> 30:04.398
| see.

30:04.560 --> 30:08.314
Me too, sometimes I question myself
and have doubts...

30:08.479 --> 30:09.707
lndeed.

30:10.400 --> 30:13.119
- It's not a bad thing.
- l'll cast all doubts aside.

30:13.280 --> 30:15.555
He's Gege Cristofori and you're...

30:15.719 --> 30:16.993
Gilda Mandarino.

30:17.200 --> 30:18.633
- And I'm...
- The manager.

30:18.800 --> 30:20.597
The manager.

30:22.120 --> 30:25.669
- So now what ’2
- Do you want to go to the hotel ’2

30:25.879 --> 30:27.949
- Yes, I'm sick ofthis ship.
- Come on.

30:28.119 --> 30:30.872
We have to get our bags, hold on.

30:31.279 --> 30:33.315
You even got here late.

30:48.480 --> 30:49.799
Morgana...

30:53.399 --> 30:55.151
Hello, do you like Uruguay ’2

30:56.079 --> 30:59.754
- A national fixation.
- She'll be your driver for now.

30:59.919 --> 31:01.671
She's a great opera singer.

31:03.480 --> 31:04.515
Thanks.

31:51.479 --> 31:54.596
What a pain in the derriére !

31:55.440 --> 31:56.759
Jesus!

32:11.639 --> 32:13.675
Montevideo's full of grand hotels.

32:13.839 --> 32:18.708
But I picked this one because
it had a special magic to it.

32:18.880 --> 32:20.313
Look.

32:21.800 --> 32:24.075
Gloriously derelict.

32:37.679 --> 32:39.431
This room's charming.

32:40.839 --> 32:42.511
Want to know why ’2

32:42.760 --> 32:44.193
Come.

32:44.439 --> 32:45.838
Come !

32:46.520 --> 32:47.555
Look.

32:47.719 --> 32:50.836
Look at the ceiling,
look at that image...

32:51.959 --> 32:54.427
| see a sort of cloud...

32:54.639 --> 32:56.391
bursting with rain.

32:56.559 --> 32:58.197
Or the shape of a dream.

32:58.399 --> 33:01.038
What does one dream
in a Montevideo hotel room ’2

33:01.560 --> 33:03.357
That's a water stain.

33:04.959 --> 33:08.872
I bet whoever slept in this room
had wonderful dreams.

33:09.720 --> 33:11.790
They dreamt of a better hotel.

33:12.759 --> 33:15.353
I'm off,
see you at the restaurant tonight.

33:15.560 --> 33:18.120
Morgana will pick you up at 8:30.

33:18.319 --> 33:21.436
I'm so thrilled you're here, Gege.

33:21.639 --> 33:22.958
Bye.

33:32.999 --> 33:34.990
Thank you, thank you.

33:35.160 --> 33:37.594
You're welcome, but get off of me.

33:38.320 --> 33:42.029
Why did you do it ’2
Why did you fill in for me ’2

33:42.200 --> 33:44.760
Maybe because I pitied you,
felt bad for you.

33:44.920 --> 33:47.673
Or maybe because I find assonance
in a washed-up singer...

33:47.840 --> 33:50.195
Forget it, I don't want to know.

33:50.360 --> 33:51.475
Come on...

33:51.640 --> 33:54.996
let's enjoy that water stain.

33:55.159 --> 33:58.390
- Full of dreams, clouds...
- Bursting with rain.

33:58.560 --> 34:00.755
Sure, rain is vital.

34:10.799 --> 34:11.868
Hello !

34:12.079 --> 34:13.558
Good evening.

34:14.760 --> 34:15.749
Hi.

34:16.480 --> 34:17.435
Hello.

34:18.519 --> 34:20.077
Sit down.

34:22.759 --> 34:25.034
Gege sits here, you there.

34:30.959 --> 34:32.870
- Like it 7
- A lot.

34:34.280 --> 34:36.635
It's a very special restaurant.

34:36.799 --> 34:40.553
lt's packed during the day
but at night it's more...

34:41.999 --> 34:44.274
- More...
- Exclusive.

34:44.440 --> 34:46.078
Yes... not exclusive...

34:47.799 --> 34:49.949
- What's the word ’2
- Deserted !

34:50.240 --> 34:55.360
Yes... meaning they only serve dinner
for four people, us four tonight.

34:55.679 --> 34:58.113
- You mean three.
- No, four.

34:58.279 --> 35:01.237
- She says four.
- We're waiting for Rosalba Bolena.

35:01.400 --> 35:03.516
Your number one fan.

35:04.439 --> 35:06.111
Here she is.

35:10.520 --> 35:12.988
- Come with me !
- l'll wash my hands.

35:22.039 --> 35:24.553
What's the deal
with this Rosalba Bolena ’?

35:24.720 --> 35:26.756
- She wanted me here.
- Huh ’?

35:26.919 --> 35:30.594
30 years ago at my concert
she met the man of her dreams.

35:30.759 --> 35:33.478
- You know how rich people are...
- I don't.

35:33.640 --> 35:36.234
Well, she wanted to organize
an anniversary

35:36.399 --> 35:39.516
so she asked Gilda's agency
to organize this show.

35:39.680 --> 35:42.399
She might recognize you.
Why didn't you tell me ’2

35:42.559 --> 35:43.708
You didn't ask.

35:46.479 --> 35:48.276
So it's my fault.

35:48.759 --> 35:51.034
Let's say 50-50.

35:52.400 --> 35:56.473
Fine, l'll accept my 50%
and go make an ass of myself.

35:56.640 --> 35:58.949
- Let's say 60-40.
- 70-30.

36:15.759 --> 36:17.750
We're mortified.

36:23.559 --> 36:25.470
Gege Cristofori ’?

36:28.079 --> 36:30.639
Oh my God, how exciting !

36:34.120 --> 36:36.998
You've become more handsome
over time.

36:37.400 --> 36:38.833
- Thanks.
- Yes.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.629
- Hello.
- Ma'am this is Ruggero, my manager.

36:42.840 --> 36:44.956
Are you pulling my leg 7!

36:47.520 --> 36:50.034
No need to call me ma'am.

36:50.199 --> 36:53.635
You're making me feel older than I am.

36:54.600 --> 36:56.352
Shall we sit ’?

36:56.560 --> 36:58.790
Gladly, let's sit down.

37:08.920 --> 37:11.957
Are there waiters
or do we self-serve ’?

37:12.120 --> 37:15.476
No... yes.
Waiter, we're ready !

38:45.360 --> 38:49.069
Hey, buddy !
Are we ready for our photo shoot ’2

38:49.240 --> 38:53.392
Let's unleash your sex appeal
that's been dormant for too long.

39:07.519 --> 39:10.079
Sorry, I can't.
I went back to the ship.

39:23.640 --> 39:25.278
Good morning.

39:25.479 --> 39:27.913
Did you sleep well ’2 Hi.

39:28.600 --> 39:31.114
- Wasn't last night great ’2
- Yes, great.

39:31.279 --> 39:35.158
- You and Rosalba like each other ’2
- Yes, great.

39:35.319 --> 39:37.037
ls Gege ready ’2

39:41.079 --> 39:43.547
- There's a problem.
- What is it ’?

39:44.480 --> 39:45.993
Gege...

39:49.239 --> 39:50.638
..isn't here.

39:50.799 --> 39:53.313
He's right there. Hello !

39:53.519 --> 39:57.148
- Morning, everything okay ’2
- Yes, ready for my shoot.

39:57.359 --> 39:59.429
Wearing... that ’2

40:00.279 --> 40:01.348
Yes.

40:01.559 --> 40:03.789
Yes, I like it... so very...

40:04.519 --> 40:05.747
you.

40:05.919 --> 40:09.116
Shall we go ’2 Shall we go ’2
I'll call Morgana.

40:09.280 --> 40:13.398
I'm so thrilled !
l'm exploding with joy, really !

40:22.920 --> 40:25.309
- Where the hell were you ’2
- I left a note.

40:25.480 --> 40:29.519
- "I can't, I went back to the ship".
- I can't sleep on dry land.

40:30.400 --> 40:32.789
Ruggero... can I trust you ’2

40:32.960 --> 40:34.678
Call me Gege.

40:35.320 --> 40:36.594
Gege !

40:37.359 --> 40:39.395
Can I trust you ’2

41:09.039 --> 41:11.109
That one's for your tombstone...

41:11.319 --> 41:14.789
- Now a cheery one for the poster.
- Why ’?

41:15.000 --> 41:18.037
This is perfect,
we don't want it to be fake.

41:18.200 --> 41:22.079
- The artist mustn't expose himself.
- Then have him turn around.

41:26.879 --> 41:29.188
I like it... I like it!

41:29.720 --> 41:32.109
Great, that's perfect !

41:33.079 --> 41:35.149
Awesome, I like it !

41:35.359 --> 41:38.431
- What do you think ’2
- I like it, the artist is his absence.

41:38.599 --> 41:41.591
- Brilliant. A posterwithout artist.
- An empty poster.

41:41.799 --> 41:44.791
- A poster without a poster.
- Does the money exist ’2

41:45.000 --> 41:47.833
- Or is it a fee without a fee ’2
- Yes, don't worry...

41:48.039 --> 41:50.712
Take a few more shots,
we'll pick later.

41:52.080 --> 41:54.514
l have to run now. Sorry, but...

41:54.720 --> 41:58.110
l have a major issue to deal with.
I like it, you're awesome.

41:58.320 --> 42:00.629
Super handsome. Kisses !

42:01.320 --> 42:02.469
Bye.

42:07.360 --> 42:08.588
What are you doing ’2

42:08.760 --> 42:11.354
A photo without a photo.

42:20.959 --> 42:23.678
- Make me a coffee.
- Make it yourself.

42:39.600 --> 42:40.715
Baby...

42:51.440 --> 42:53.032
Give me a second.

42:53.199 --> 42:54.552
Sorry.

42:54.759 --> 42:57.227
I'll be back in a second.

43:04.960 --> 43:06.075
Hi, Rosalba.

43:08.000 --> 43:12.073
Things went well last night.
Seems like they fell for it.

43:12.679 --> 43:14.078
Yes.

43:14.919 --> 43:16.750
I played a good billionaire ’?

43:16.959 --> 43:19.075
Yes, you were perfect.

43:19.400 --> 43:21.994
Thanks.
Coming from another actress...

43:22.199 --> 43:24.429
Listen, I wanted to tell you...

43:26.679 --> 43:28.556
Everything okay, Gilda ’?

43:28.720 --> 43:30.233
Still my cohort ’?

43:31.360 --> 43:33.510
Yes, yes, but...

43:34.119 --> 43:35.871
We'll talk tomorrow.

43:36.079 --> 43:39.310
I'm at rehearsals and ljust died.

43:39.999 --> 43:41.148
You okay, Gilda ’?

43:41.840 --> 43:43.512
What's going on ?

43:43.720 --> 43:46.188
Are you reconsidering ’?

43:47.799 --> 43:49.551
You're regretting it ?

43:49.759 --> 43:52.910
You're a good actress,
you just need popularity

43:53.119 --> 43:56.156
and you're about to get it !

44:01.839 --> 44:04.307
I just want to sing

44:04.519 --> 44:08.307
because I feel a shiver in my heart

44:08.719 --> 44:10.914
I just want to play music

44:11.080 --> 44:12.752
Because in my chest...

44:12.919 --> 44:14.910
| feel ridiculous up here.

44:15.119 --> 44:17.587
You need to get used to
being on stage.

44:17.759 --> 44:20.319
They'll realize
I'm not a professional singer.

44:21.959 --> 44:22.948
Of course...

44:24.239 --> 44:26.992
you look like you're chopping liver.

44:27.199 --> 44:30.396
My face doesn't matter,
I have to learn 10 songs in 3 days.

44:30.600 --> 44:33.160
Dress rehearsal with the orchestra's
in 2 days.

44:33.320 --> 44:35.356
You need to assume an attitude.

44:36.800 --> 44:42.318
There are two kinds of singers: ones
who hold the mic like an ice cream

44:42.479 --> 44:44.868
and ones who hold it like a god.

44:49.079 --> 44:51.149
You sing, I can't.

44:53.720 --> 44:54.675
Bravo.

44:57.280 --> 45:00.477
Bravo ! You also need
to exude charisma.

45:00.840 --> 45:05.072
- How do | exude it ’2
- Stare into nothingness.

45:05.400 --> 45:07.311
Look toward the horizon.

45:07.480 --> 45:11.678
The audience should think:
"What the fuck's he looking at ’2"

45:12.240 --> 45:15.949
It could work. While exuding charisma
and staring into nothingness

45:16.119 --> 45:18.679
and the audience thinks:
"What the fuck's he looking at ’2"

45:18.840 --> 45:22.435
they get distracted and won't think:
"He sucks at singing".

45:22.599 --> 45:23.998
Bravo !

45:24.159 --> 45:26.229
- Stare into nothingness.
- Yes.

45:39.360 --> 45:40.873
See ’2

45:41.479 --> 45:43.515
You hypnotized her.

46:09.119 --> 46:11.997
Street artists move me,
they're free, straightfonlvard...

46:12.160 --> 46:14.151
Some start on the streets,

46:14.319 --> 46:16.275
some end up on the streets.

46:27.480 --> 46:29.038
Rosalba, what's up ’2

46:30.360 --> 46:33.432
- Don't you live here ’2
- No, | live down there.

46:33.640 --> 46:36.598
- Let's go inside.
- No, come up here.

46:36.799 --> 46:38.471
It's much more...

46:38.679 --> 46:41.637
It's much prettier up here. Come up.

46:47.080 --> 46:49.548
- What's going ’2
- Nothing.

46:49.759 --> 46:53.798
On the phone today
you seemed to be wavering.

46:53.999 --> 46:56.877
Is that why you've come to stalk me ’2

46:57.040 --> 47:00.715
I want to make sure
you didn't change your mind.

47:01.199 --> 47:03.713
Gilda, this is your big break!

47:03.920 --> 47:05.876
I know.

47:07.319 --> 47:09.150
I'm struggling.

47:09.359 --> 47:11.827
At the age of 30 | find out...

47:12.040 --> 47:14.713
my father's an Italian singer.

47:14.919 --> 47:17.387
I meet him,
expecting a son of a bitch...

47:17.600 --> 47:19.716
Is he a son of a bitch ’?

47:19.920 --> 47:23.469
No, he's someone who sees
the shape of a dream

47:23.679 --> 47:25.237
in a water stain.

47:25.440 --> 47:29.115
Don't let thatjerk dupe you
like he did to your mom.

47:29.320 --> 47:30.992
He's not a jerk.

47:31.199 --> 47:35.477
So what the hell do you want to do ’?
Botch it all up ’2

47:37.279 --> 47:41.716
I didn't say that,
ljust want to get to know him better.

47:44.640 --> 47:48.519
Listen up, this is what we'll do:

47:48.719 --> 47:52.792
until the day ofthe show,
you're not allowed to see your father

47:52.999 --> 47:55.433
unless I'm around, okay ’2

47:57.519 --> 47:59.077
Look at me.

47:59.439 --> 48:01.111
Promise ’?

48:01.320 --> 48:03.117
Promise.

48:14.799 --> 48:18.314
What meaning am | trying to convey
with these ditties ’?

48:18.480 --> 48:22.029
- What meaning ’2 Just sing them.
- I can't pinpoint my motive.

48:22.199 --> 48:24.554
What motive? They're love songs.

48:24.720 --> 48:27.473
lfthere's love, they're happy,
othenlvise they're not.

48:27.640 --> 48:31.792
- These are all happy.
- In view of happiness as an emotion...

48:31.959 --> 48:34.712
what mindset
should I approach this with ’2

48:34.879 --> 48:38.508
With the mindset
that they're paying us generously.

48:38.680 --> 48:41.513
So it's a happy mindset.

48:46.039 --> 48:49.634
Hello.
Sorry, didn't mean to interrupt you.

48:50.279 --> 48:52.747
- Can I talk to you ’2
- Sure.

48:52.920 --> 48:54.399
Alone.

48:56.280 --> 48:58.350
- Make it quick...
- Yes.

51:04.399 --> 51:07.118
There's no trace of you online,
no photos...

51:07.319 --> 51:12.518
I made a million calls in Italy
and when I found you, you said that...

51:13.280 --> 51:17.159
- Said what ’2
- "What the fuck d'you want ’? Piss off."

51:17.959 --> 51:21.235
Did you think l was pulling your leg ’2

51:21.400 --> 51:23.356
Since you no longer sing...

51:24.519 --> 51:28.592
- Maybe it wasjust a bad day ’2
- Yes... a bad day.

51:29.399 --> 51:33.074
l have a collection of bad days,
some are super rare.

51:35.160 --> 51:37.594
I'd like to see your collection
one day.

51:46.719 --> 51:47.834
Let's go.

52:06.879 --> 52:09.347
You're not very talkative, are you ’2

52:11.719 --> 52:12.993
No.

52:15.639 --> 52:18.756
I value words
so I try not to waste them.

52:19.479 --> 52:22.437
Imagine if we could just use
one word a day...

52:22.600 --> 52:24.079
- Just one ’2
- Yes.

52:24.880 --> 52:28.714
You pick one in the morning
and can only use that all day.

52:28.880 --> 52:33.112
Impossible, you'd need at least 10
to get through the day.

52:33.799 --> 52:36.267
Well then you can use... 21.

52:37.479 --> 52:39.947
10 for survival and...

54:40.079 --> 54:41.831
| feel much better.

54:45.639 --> 54:48.517
Now I can be more... more me.

54:49.680 --> 54:52.035
Now you know my secret.

54:52.720 --> 54:53.596
Well...

54:55.799 --> 54:57.676
It's nice.

54:58.719 --> 55:00.710
It is.

55:03.279 --> 55:06.396
Who would've thought
that Gilda Mandarino...

55:06.559 --> 55:08.595
is an actress.

55:08.880 --> 55:10.552
Why didn't you tell me ’2

55:11.639 --> 55:14.631
Dunno, because I'm working for you,
for the show...

55:14.800 --> 55:17.155
I didn't want to seem inept.

55:17.319 --> 55:19.355
I want everything to go smoothly.

55:27.480 --> 55:31.109
Is anyone ever going to tell me
what happened to this chef,

55:31.279 --> 55:35.431
poet, motorcyclist,
stand-in singer and whatever else ’2

55:35.600 --> 55:37.875
You were right, I did get lost.

55:38.799 --> 55:41.233
At one point, something happened.

55:41.399 --> 55:42.718
What 7

55:44.559 --> 55:46.914
It doesn't matter anymore.

55:48.879 --> 55:50.073
Tell me !

55:50.240 --> 55:51.514
Tell me !

55:51.679 --> 55:53.635
Tell me, tell me !

55:55.359 --> 55:59.955
There was an underage gin
at the high school he taught at...

56:00.360 --> 56:04.558
- He assaulted a minor 7
- No, she fell in love with him.

56:04.719 --> 56:06.311
She provoked him.

56:06.479 --> 56:08.629
So...

56:08.800 --> 56:10.756
they assaulted each other 7

56:13.480 --> 56:15.710
I don't understand.

56:15.879 --> 56:16.834
Carry on.

56:22.039 --> 56:23.916
- I've got it !
- What 7

56:24.039 --> 56:26.030
A 10-word poem.

56:26.199 --> 56:31.398
Poetry is like a pearl necklace
to be worn nude.

56:31.799 --> 56:32.914
10!

56:33.119 --> 56:35.235
It's by Santiago Velasquez, know him 7

56:35.439 --> 56:38.317
No, but poems belong to
whoever says them.

56:38.760 --> 56:40.113
And that was lovely.

56:40.279 --> 56:43.635
An in-depth investigation
was called for,

56:43.799 --> 56:48.236
he came out clean
but word ofthe scandal got around.

56:48.399 --> 56:51.038
He couldn't bear it,
out of pride, shame...

56:51.480 --> 56:53.038
he just up and left.

56:53.199 --> 56:55.394
Slowly... don't turn around.

57:03.399 --> 57:05.117
Now stop.

57:05.319 --> 57:07.628
Turn around... and look.

57:08.919 --> 57:10.955
I walked in your footsteps.

57:11.080 --> 57:13.310
Now you walk in mine. Wait...

57:19.279 --> 57:20.917
Hands and feet !

57:21.080 --> 57:23.435
lfeel the urge to say... fuck off!

57:24.119 --> 57:26.314
Perfect for turning over a new leaf.

57:29.320 --> 57:31.470
- Like this 7 Watch.
- Do it.

57:40.719 --> 57:44.428
Alcide, can I trust
Ruggero Chiaromonte ?

57:44.600 --> 57:45.589
Of course !

57:45.800 --> 57:49.236
He's an upright guy,
you heard the speech he wrote for me.

57:49.400 --> 57:50.913
It was amazing !

57:51.080 --> 57:54.197
My problem is I'm afraid
to speak to an audience.

57:54.360 --> 57:56.396
No problem, leave it to me.

57:56.560 --> 57:58.949
I know a thing or two
about audiences.

58:10.600 --> 58:11.919
What's wrong 7

58:12.079 --> 58:14.070
Gas. I messed up our day.

58:14.240 --> 58:18.791
No, it was an amazing day. The first
in my collection of great days.

58:19.559 --> 58:21.629
We can hitchhike from here.

58:21.799 --> 58:24.029
- Should I lock the door 7
- Yes.

58:31.319 --> 58:35.278
This road doesn't seem
to have much traffic...

58:38.320 --> 58:40.390
Here we go !

58:43.319 --> 58:44.718
Please !

58:53.399 --> 58:57.028
It's best if we don't tell Rosalba.

58:57.200 --> 59:00.749
- That we ran out of gas 7
- No, that we were together.

59:00.919 --> 59:04.070
- Why 7
- Because it's unprofessional...

59:04.240 --> 59:07.949
to go out with the artist
and have a good time with him.

59:08.120 --> 59:12.033
It's not part ofthe responsibilities
the agency gave me.

59:12.199 --> 59:14.667
I like people
who think outside the box.

59:14.839 --> 59:17.034
I had a great time today.

59:17.839 --> 59:19.795
Can I hug you 7

59:20.280 --> 59:21.633
Sure...

59:21.800 --> 59:23.836
Don't feel obliged to.

59:23.999 --> 59:27.150
But let's move away from...
just in case...

59:27.879 --> 59:29.676
Here...

59:29.839 --> 59:31.955
Here... if you want.

59:40.919 --> 59:43.353
There's... there's something...

59:44.040 --> 59:45.996
I should tell you.

59:47.280 --> 59:48.759
What 7

59:49.039 --> 59:52.634
- I'm not sure if I should do this.
- Why 7

59:52.800 --> 59:54.756
I'm feeling so emotional...

59:57.119 --> 59:58.188
No!

59:59.920 --> 1:00:02.115
- Sorry !
- It's my fault !

1:00:02.319 --> 1:00:04.833
- I'm sorry !
- l have to go to rehearsal.

1:00:05.039 --> 1:00:07.428
- You have to go...
- Yes, sorry !

1:00:07.639 --> 1:00:10.790
- Move the car!
- But there's no...

1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:13.275
I know, no gas, but deal with it.

1:00:13.479 --> 1:00:15.151
- I'll come too.
- Don't!

1:00:15.320 --> 1:00:17.470
- Why 7
- lt's unprofessional.

1:00:24.720 --> 1:00:26.551
I don't have the keys.

1:00:37.519 --> 1:00:40.875
Who are we 7 Where are we from 7

1:00:41.040 --> 1:00:42.678
Where are we going 7

1:00:42.840 --> 1:00:46.594
But above all, how will we get back 7
And where to 7

1:01:06.199 --> 1:01:08.076
Who is it 7

1:01:08.199 --> 1:01:11.509
This isn't what it looks like,
let me explain.

1:01:11.719 --> 1:01:14.279
Explain at the precinct.
Get down, please.

1:01:14.440 --> 1:01:17.079
Pull my leg please, I'm stuck.

1:01:20.239 --> 1:01:23.754
All we sailors need
is a backpack of thoughts

1:01:23.960 --> 1:01:25.678
and a case of souls.

1:01:25.840 --> 1:01:30.038
While at sea, even thoughts
of women find theirway in

1:01:30.199 --> 1:01:32.508
and make us feel their absence.

1:01:32.680 --> 1:01:34.591
- Thanks.
- The finale 7

1:01:35.079 --> 1:01:36.398
No.

1:01:36.560 --> 1:01:38.869
The finale on masturbation is lovely.

1:01:40.039 --> 1:01:41.518
I won't say it.

1:01:42.279 --> 1:01:46.477
- I won't say "masturbation".
- Why not 7 Let's say it together.

1:01:47.159 --> 1:01:50.788
Ma... stur... ba... tion.

1:01:50.960 --> 1:01:53.349
Help him, ladies.
One, two, three...

1:01:53.800 --> 1:01:56.155
Ma... stur... ba... tion.

1:01:56.719 --> 1:01:58.118
I won't say it.

1:02:05.679 --> 1:02:07.749
Can I speak to the chief7

1:02:07.959 --> 1:02:10.075
He'll be back tomorrow morning.

1:02:10.279 --> 1:02:12.554
I can only sleep on the boat, not here.

1:02:12.760 --> 1:02:14.671
Then don't sleep.

1:02:22.999 --> 1:02:25.229
Do you like Uruguay 7

1:02:25.720 --> 1:02:27.073
Sir 7

1:02:29.080 --> 1:02:31.389
Ma... stur... ba... tion.

1:02:31.600 --> 1:02:33.591
Ma... stur... ba... tion.

1:02:33.999 --> 1:02:36.559
Ma... stur... ba... tion.

1:02:48.880 --> 1:02:52.236
Honey ! Honey ! Honey !

1:02:52.440 --> 1:02:55.716
I will call you Eve
because you're number one.

1:02:56.680 --> 1:03:01.629
And I'll call you Dalmatian
because you're number 101 !

1:03:05.719 --> 1:03:06.913
More !

1:03:07.120 --> 1:03:11.910
No more, sorry. Thanks for being
understanding about my chef.

1:03:12.040 --> 1:03:15.032
- Thank you all.
- Thanks a bunch.

1:03:15.200 --> 1:03:16.110
Good bye.

1:03:19.719 --> 1:03:23.553
Thanks, chief.
I made up a story and sorted it out.

1:03:23.720 --> 1:03:26.439
- There's a cop behind me
- Right, hush.

1:03:26.600 --> 1:03:28.875
- Why'd you call the captain 7
- If I'd called Gilda

1:03:29.039 --> 1:03:31.507
..she would've known I'm not Gege.
- Bravo !

1:03:31.679 --> 1:03:34.637
That chief sure was a real gentleman.

1:03:34.800 --> 1:03:36.950
He understood and closed an eye.

1:03:37.120 --> 1:03:39.429
- Thanks again.
- l have to go now.

1:03:39.600 --> 1:03:42.751
l have lots to do before we set sail.

1:03:42.920 --> 1:03:45.388
See you later.
Bye, thanks.

1:03:51.559 --> 1:03:53.311
The hotel's this way.

1:03:53.479 --> 1:03:56.596
Oh, it's that way.
I guess it's goodbye then.

1:03:56.759 --> 1:03:59.193
Take care, all right 7

1:04:12.079 --> 1:04:15.355
- Want to eat it now or in the hotel 7
- I had a big breakfast.

1:04:15.520 --> 1:04:19.798
Just don't look insecure
in rehearsals today.

1:04:19.960 --> 1:04:23.589
- If you mess up you do what 7
- Stare into nothingness.

1:04:23.759 --> 1:04:26.353
- You feeling ready 7
- You know...

1:04:26.520 --> 1:04:31.071
My cellmate was lovely, insightful.
I even slept 2 hours.

1:04:31.239 --> 1:04:34.311
Jail helped you get over
your taboo of sleeping on land 7

1:04:34.479 --> 1:04:36.834
Maybe life in prison is the solution.

1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:40.993
Your field trip with Gilda
taught you to laugh at yourself.

1:04:41.200 --> 1:04:43.953
We can say an acrobatic friendship
was formed.

1:04:47.479 --> 1:04:49.515
Well then, to get even

1:04:49.680 --> 1:04:53.559
I should call Rosalba
for a roll in the sack.

1:04:54.880 --> 1:04:56.757
Let's go shower.

1:05:30.239 --> 1:05:31.911
Sorry...

1:05:35.240 --> 1:05:37.310
What's wrong, dear 7

1:05:37.480 --> 1:05:40.438
- lt'sjetlag.
- So what time would be better 7

1:05:41.199 --> 1:05:43.667
We'll give it a shot later.

1:05:44.400 --> 1:05:47.198
- Shall we go back in 7
- Yes.

1:06:01.999 --> 1:06:04.194
- Wow, aren't they good 7
- Very.

1:06:04.359 --> 1:06:07.590
Afternoon ballroom dancing
in the land of Tango...

1:06:07.720 --> 1:06:09.278
What rebels.

1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:13.037
The place closes in 30 minutes
then you can rehearse.

1:06:13.199 --> 1:06:14.632
Finally...

1:06:15.200 --> 1:06:20.149
About last night: I realize
I should've stopped at the hug.

1:06:20.319 --> 1:06:22.469
- Don't bring it up now.
- Okay.

1:06:22.680 --> 1:06:25.114
- So I'm happy with a hug.
- Don't bring it up.

1:06:25.559 --> 1:06:29.598
Gilda, we need to speak
to the orchestra manager.

1:06:31.639 --> 1:06:34.756
Your manager has a problem
with jetlag.

1:06:36.120 --> 1:06:38.111
- Problem with jetlag 7
- Problem 7!

1:06:38.320 --> 1:06:40.880
She pounced on me
without any warning.

1:06:41.040 --> 1:06:45.636
I need to ease into it.
My voice wilted and so did the rest.

1:06:46.120 --> 1:06:49.112
lfeel like I should tell Gilda
I'm not Gege Cristofori.

1:06:49.319 --> 1:06:53.437
- Sure, after the concert.
- You don't get it...

1:06:53.680 --> 1:06:56.478
- I'm not sure I can keep lying.
- Don't screw me.

1:06:56.640 --> 1:07:00.189
- I can't promise that.
- Are you gonna pay me the money 7

1:07:00.840 --> 1:07:02.990
Don't be stupid, Ruggero.

1:07:03.959 --> 1:07:06.519
- Cristofori !
- Say hello.

1:07:07.040 --> 1:07:09.031
- How are you 7
- Hello.

1:07:09.560 --> 1:07:11.790
Gege Cristofori !

1:07:11.999 --> 1:07:13.557
He's talking to you.

1:07:14.160 --> 1:07:15.957
Recognize me 7

1:07:16.120 --> 1:07:20.238
l'm Pietro Villani,
I'm part ofthe orchestra.

1:07:20.960 --> 1:07:22.518
Remember me 7

1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:25.798
The tour... 30 years ago.

1:07:26.160 --> 1:07:29.994
- He remembers everything.
- 30 years, I had more hair then.

1:07:32.080 --> 1:07:33.638
Come say hi to the others.

1:07:35.360 --> 1:07:36.918
What'll we do 7

1:07:38.320 --> 1:07:39.639
Villani !

1:07:43.359 --> 1:07:44.917
Yes 7

1:07:50.320 --> 1:07:52.914
- What happened 7
- Come on !

1:07:53.119 --> 1:07:54.837
That asshole.

1:07:59.199 --> 1:08:02.157
- Why'd you hit that poor guy 7
- Relax, I have a plan.

1:08:02.320 --> 1:08:04.436
- Play along.
- Great...

1:08:04.600 --> 1:08:07.478
- What happened 7
- I'll tell you what happened...

1:08:07.639 --> 1:08:12.588
ljust commented on his guitar playing
and that dwarf attacked us.

1:08:12.760 --> 1:08:15.399
- Tell them.
- Yes, he's small but vicious.

1:08:15.559 --> 1:08:18.471
Okay, I'll talkto him
and we'll sort it out.

1:08:18.960 --> 1:08:20.518
You don't get it.

1:08:20.679 --> 1:08:24.228
Gege Cristofori will not go on stage
with those musicians.

1:08:24.440 --> 1:08:26.715
So you want to call off the show 7

1:08:26.919 --> 1:08:30.673
You won't call off anything,
I'm paying for this.

1:08:31.079 --> 1:08:34.151
lf Gege doesn't want to play
with them, no problem.

1:08:34.320 --> 1:08:37.039
The show must go on.

1:08:37.639 --> 1:08:39.709
We'll get a new orchestra.

1:08:41.639 --> 1:08:42.913
Good.

1:09:27.560 --> 1:09:31.951
Ladies and gentlemen,
Gege Cristofori and The Mutineers.

1:10:15.120 --> 1:10:17.031
Ready in five.

1:10:35.799 --> 1:10:38.438
Why all this food 7 What a waste.

1:10:38.600 --> 1:10:40.431
l demanded it.

1:10:40.600 --> 1:10:44.354
After a lifetime of crap,
at least I can satisfy a few whims

1:10:44.520 --> 1:10:46.590
even if only by proxy.

1:10:51.600 --> 1:10:53.795
Sir, the venue is full. Let's go.

1:10:59.279 --> 1:11:01.076
Damn, you look snazzy.

1:11:03.479 --> 1:11:05.549
My saliva is all dried up.

1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:08.673
Once you start singing it'll be fine.

1:11:11.559 --> 1:11:13.072
Wait...

1:11:13.239 --> 1:11:16.436
You're the artist,
let me lead the way.

1:11:22.600 --> 1:11:24.716
Come on, we're ready !

1:11:24.880 --> 1:11:25.995
Let's go.

1:11:38.520 --> 1:11:42.354
- Everything okay 7
- Yes, the guys learned the songs.

1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:45.878
The show we held on the ship
was a hit,

1:11:46.079 --> 1:11:48.513
not exactly the same
as playing to a sold-out venue.

1:11:48.679 --> 1:11:51.910
- We have to talk after the show.
- I'd like that.

1:11:52.720 --> 1:11:54.676
To finally talk.

1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:57.275
- About that kiss...
- Not now.

1:11:57.839 --> 1:11:59.511
I can't explain it.

1:12:00.960 --> 1:12:03.155
ljust found myself
locking lips with you...

1:12:06.480 --> 1:12:08.357
And I liked it.

1:12:10.239 --> 1:12:12.878
I won't do it again
if you don't want.

1:12:13.040 --> 1:12:14.917
I doubt it.

1:12:16.399 --> 1:12:19.197
I'll go take my seat.
Good luck.

1:12:19.919 --> 1:12:21.352
Good luck.

1:12:47.400 --> 1:12:50.312
His jaw hit the floor!

1:12:50.519 --> 1:12:52.794
We'll tar and feather you.

1:12:58.759 --> 1:13:00.477
I'm your translator.

1:13:08.320 --> 1:13:11.118
Welcome to "Twist of Fate" !

1:13:11.320 --> 1:13:13.038
The show that

1:13:13.480 --> 1:13:15.038
leaves you speechless.

1:13:21.360 --> 1:13:24.113
Hello, Gege Cristofori.
You don't know "Twist of Fate".

1:13:28.560 --> 1:13:31.279
You must be wondering
what's going on.

1:13:36.040 --> 1:13:38.235
Know her, Agustina Mandarino 7

1:13:44.559 --> 1:13:47.596
You invited her to dance on stage
during your concert.

1:13:55.919 --> 1:13:57.637
You made her feel like a queen

1:13:57.840 --> 1:14:01.196
on stage and then...
you spent the night together.

1:14:01.720 --> 1:14:05.395
ForAgustina that night of love
was life-changing.

1:14:05.880 --> 1:14:07.757
We learned ofthis story

1:14:07.959 --> 1:14:10.393
from the fruit of that night of love.

1:14:10.560 --> 1:14:13.632
Ladies and gentlemen,
his daughter...

1:14:13.800 --> 1:14:17.713
Gilda Mandarino !

1:14:18.280 --> 1:14:20.794
Your daughter... you shithead.

1:15:20.400 --> 1:15:22.118
Stop !

1:15:22.879 --> 1:15:25.268
Why didn't you hug him 7

1:15:25.479 --> 1:15:27.674
You were supposed to hug him.

1:15:28.039 --> 1:15:32.635
The show's most moving moment
is the father-daughter hug.

1:15:32.880 --> 1:15:34.598
What's going on 7

1:15:35.720 --> 1:15:37.551
What daughter 7

1:15:38.799 --> 1:15:40.551
Gege Cristofori doesn't have kids.

1:15:43.439 --> 1:15:45.555
I'll have you all arrested.

1:15:45.920 --> 1:15:49.356
You have to pay us, pay up !

1:15:57.320 --> 1:15:59.436
You and your talk...

1:16:05.680 --> 1:16:07.671
I don't have kids.

1:16:13.359 --> 1:16:15.919
Sorry, but we rehearsed a lot.

1:16:16.080 --> 1:16:18.150
We never played in a theater.

1:16:18.319 --> 1:16:20.469
Can we do one tune at least 7

1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:23.989
Go on.

1:16:57.879 --> 1:17:00.188
When will
these fucking musicians leave 7

1:17:15.239 --> 1:17:18.549
I'll have them arrested.
They have to pay me.

1:17:18.719 --> 1:17:20.789
Do you realize what happened 7

1:17:21.600 --> 1:17:23.909
You have a daughter, Gege.

1:17:30.600 --> 1:17:32.079
Ruggero...

1:17:56.120 --> 1:17:59.157
- Miss Gilda.
- I'm looking for Gege Cristofori.

1:17:59.320 --> 1:18:02.790
He didn't feel well,
they took him to the Italian hospital.

1:18:09.919 --> 1:18:11.432
- How are you 7
- Fine.

1:18:11.559 --> 1:18:13.470
- What's wrong 7
- Sit, we need to talk.

1:18:13.640 --> 1:18:15.437
- Are you okay 7
- Just sit.

1:18:15.600 --> 1:18:18.160
I owe you an explanation
forwhat I did.

1:18:18.319 --> 1:18:21.277
- There's no explanation.
- I need to explain...

1:18:21.480 --> 1:18:25.029
how important it was for me
to avenge my mother.

1:18:25.239 --> 1:18:27.389
But I've got nothing to do with it.

1:18:27.600 --> 1:18:30.478
I know, it's hard to accept
that you have a child.

1:18:30.639 --> 1:18:34.678
It's hard for me to accept
l have a father after all these years.

1:18:35.120 --> 1:18:36.997
My mom said you were dead.

1:18:37.599 --> 1:18:41.194
Last year she took ill
and fessed up before dying.

1:18:42.600 --> 1:18:46.639
I wanted to meet you,
tell you about her, about me.

1:18:48.879 --> 1:18:51.234
I know, I fucked up big time, I know.

1:18:52.239 --> 1:18:54.548
I thought I would hate you
but I didn't.

1:19:00.959 --> 1:19:02.870
Your manager isn't well 7

1:19:03.080 --> 1:19:05.514
Are you Mr. Cristofori's relative 7

1:19:05.720 --> 1:19:07.517
No...

1:19:07.680 --> 1:19:09.511
But this is his daughter.

1:19:12.119 --> 1:19:13.347
What 7

1:19:15.080 --> 1:19:17.469
Then... who are you 7

1:19:19.720 --> 1:19:21.517
His friend.

1:19:23.439 --> 1:19:26.988
We met 20 days ago on the ship
where I'm a chef.

1:19:33.080 --> 1:19:34.559
He's your father.

1:19:48.519 --> 1:19:50.475
Come with me.

1:20:23.200 --> 1:20:25.031
You don't have to stay,

1:20:25.239 --> 1:20:28.868
he's sedated
and will sleep the whole night.

1:20:29.599 --> 1:20:31.510
Things aren't looking so good,

1:20:31.720 --> 1:20:35.235
but tomorrow I'll have more details.

1:20:36.200 --> 1:20:37.918
Thanks.

1:21:42.119 --> 1:21:43.472
Chiaromonte.

1:21:45.959 --> 1:21:47.631
What happened 7

1:21:48.520 --> 1:21:52.638
I went to see the concert
but the theater was closed.

1:21:53.439 --> 1:21:55.475
Maybe I made a mistake.

1:21:58.280 --> 1:22:00.919
No, I made a mistake going ashore.

1:22:03.319 --> 1:22:05.469
You were reinstated.

1:22:05.960 --> 1:22:08.315
We set sail in two days.

1:22:08.680 --> 1:22:10.955
- For how long 7
- Two months.

1:22:11.119 --> 1:22:14.350
With all due respect,
you're making a fucking mistake.

1:22:17.400 --> 1:22:19.516
What would you like for lunch 7

1:22:23.360 --> 1:22:25.476
Spaghetti with fresh tomato sauce.

1:22:25.840 --> 1:22:27.990
Nice and simple.

1:22:48.320 --> 1:22:49.992
Hi.

1:22:53.359 --> 1:22:54.758
Why are you here 7

1:22:54.920 --> 1:22:58.390
I wanted to look at you
without thinking you were my father.

1:23:01.199 --> 1:23:03.190
Okay, you've looked at me now...

1:23:08.119 --> 1:23:10.474
- Gege's not well.
- What's new 7!

1:23:10.639 --> 1:23:14.518
He's really ill, the doctor said
he doesn't have much time left.

1:23:14.680 --> 1:23:18.514
They found something awful
by his vocal cords.

1:23:19.600 --> 1:23:22.990
He left the hospital,
he asked to be discharged.

1:23:23.480 --> 1:23:26.756
l have to find him
so I can at least apologize.

1:23:28.239 --> 1:23:30.514
And I want to apologize to you too.

1:23:32.280 --> 1:23:33.349
Sorry...

1:23:35.439 --> 1:23:37.191
- Hello 7
- Gilda.

1:23:37.359 --> 1:23:40.396
- Dad 7
- Not dad, that freaks me out.

1:23:40.559 --> 1:23:41.514
Where are you ?

1:23:41.720 --> 1:23:45.235
- I couldn't find you. How are you 7
- Fine for now.

1:23:45.439 --> 1:23:50.115
The pain killers they gave me
have me walking on cloud nine.

1:23:50.319 --> 1:23:53.311
- Go back to the hospital.
- What for ?

1:23:53.520 --> 1:23:57.229
There's nothing more they can do,
what's done is done.

1:23:57.400 --> 1:24:00.039
I want to make the most
ofthe time l have left

1:24:00.199 --> 1:24:03.191
and enjoy this surprise
that life handed me,

1:24:03.359 --> 1:24:04.792
sudden fatherhood.

1:24:04.999 --> 1:24:08.150
Actually, I called to ask you...

1:24:08.360 --> 1:24:10.555
Where's your mother 7

1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:15.437
- Why do you want my mother 7
- I wanted to thank her.

1:24:15.880 --> 1:24:19.919
I've been searching for her,
Agustina Mandarino, right 7

1:24:20.879 --> 1:24:21.914
Where are you 7

1:24:22.519 --> 1:24:25.556
- At the Central Cemetery.
- She's not there.

1:24:25.759 --> 1:24:28.148
She's at Buceo Cemetery.

1:24:30.319 --> 1:24:31.877
At Buceo.

1:24:32.039 --> 1:24:35.429
- ls Buceo nearby 7
- Yes.

1:24:35.559 --> 1:24:37.789
- Dad ?
- I'm going to Buceo.

1:24:38.479 --> 1:24:41.198
- We'll be right there.
- We, who 7

1:24:41.600 --> 1:24:44.512
Me and the chef.

1:24:44.880 --> 1:24:45.915
Bye.

1:24:46.560 --> 1:24:47.515
Bye.

1:24:49.519 --> 1:24:52.795
- Thanks for the phone.
- No problem. Good luck.

1:24:56.920 --> 1:24:58.831
What's your name 7

1:24:58.999 --> 1:25:00.148
Ruggero.

1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:23.877
l'm rehearsing.

1:25:27.679 --> 1:25:29.670
Did she speak well of me 7

1:25:29.840 --> 1:25:33.469
She didn't speak of you at all.
It was late when I found out.

1:25:33.640 --> 1:25:37.474
But the little she did say
gave me an idea of you.

1:25:37.640 --> 1:25:39.198
Positive 7

1:25:39.359 --> 1:25:42.237
More or less an asshole...
charming though.

1:25:42.399 --> 1:25:44.674
Better than nothing.

1:25:44.840 --> 1:25:46.831
Do you remember her now 7

1:25:47.440 --> 1:25:50.796
I could say yes but...
I don't want to bullshit you anymore.

1:25:52.759 --> 1:25:54.989
- I'll go get a vase.
- Okay.

1:25:58.959 --> 1:26:02.668
Could it be that a woman
I had a one-night stand with

1:26:02.839 --> 1:26:05.069
is the most important woman
of my life 7

1:26:05.240 --> 1:26:06.355
Yes.

1:26:06.920 --> 1:26:09.036
Even if I don't remember her 7

1:26:09.200 --> 1:26:10.235
Yes.

1:26:12.599 --> 1:26:14.794
Go give her a hand.

1:26:14.959 --> 1:26:17.189
I'll finish rehearsing.

1:26:24.760 --> 1:26:26.591
Gilda, that prank,

1:26:26.800 --> 1:26:31.271
that tasteless prank in the theater,
will it end up on TV7

1:26:31.439 --> 1:26:35.830
Yes, "Twist of Fate"
is a major TV show in Uruguay.

1:26:36.399 --> 1:26:40.472
So finally Gege Cristofori
will have his TV debut.

1:26:44.119 --> 1:26:45.518
What a shame !

1:26:50.279 --> 1:26:52.235
Welcome to "Twist of Fate" !

1:26:52.440 --> 1:26:53.998
The show that...

1:26:54.199 --> 1:26:56.190
leaves you speechless.

1:27:03.439 --> 1:27:06.078
Our last story tonight

1:27:06.239 --> 1:27:07.672
speaks ltalian.

1:27:07.879 --> 1:27:10.837
Because it features

1:27:11.040 --> 1:27:13.759
the great singer, Gege Cristofori !

1:27:13.960 --> 1:27:16.599
Roll the clip, please.

1:27:16.999 --> 1:27:18.432
Ready...

1:27:18.639 --> 1:27:21.756
in three, two, one...

1:27:21.919 --> 1:27:23.352
go.

1:27:25.519 --> 1:27:29.398
He had a brilliant singer career
in his country

1:27:29.600 --> 1:27:34.071
until he decided to retire
to the sidelines

1:27:34.239 --> 1:27:37.072
and produce music
in his recording studio.

1:27:37.279 --> 1:27:40.589
He hadn't been to Montevideo
in 35 years...

1:27:40.799 --> 1:27:45.270
since that memorable day of his concert
many still remember.

1:27:45.520 --> 1:27:49.957
"Twist of Fate"
brought him back to Montevideo...

1:27:50.680 --> 1:27:55.993
in the same theater
he had played in back then.

1:27:56.359 --> 1:27:59.112
But there was no audience
waiting for him, just...

1:27:59.800 --> 1:28:02.030
"Twist of Fate" !

1:28:09.399 --> 1:28:11.435
Now you're probably wondering

1:28:11.799 --> 1:28:14.518
what actually happened.

1:28:14.679 --> 1:28:16.476
Why "Twist of Fate"

1:28:16.679 --> 1:28:20.433
had him come perform
for an empty theater.

1:28:21.280 --> 1:28:24.272
Rest assured,
in just a few more minutes

1:31:05.080 --> 1:31:07.469
Why are you so insecure 7

1:31:07.680 --> 1:31:09.636
Yes, I like Uruguay !

1:31:09.839 --> 1:31:14.151
A lot ! It's a civilized, welcoming,
delectable country.

1:31:14.919 --> 1:31:19.117
And it was here...
that I met my daughter, Gilda !

1:36:03.600 --> 1:36:05.830
And soon night comes

1:36:07.720 --> 1:36:10.996
While my thoughts

1:36:11.879 --> 1:36:14.871
Come to a conclusion

1:36:16.079 --> 1:36:18.957
Come to a conclusion

1:36:20.359 --> 1:36:23.192
And this is the conclusion

1:36:23.400 --> 1:36:27.996
It's necessan/ to have an opinion
and share it

1:36:28.759 --> 1:36:33.071
A cheen/ catchy tune
Just enough

1:36:34.959 --> 1:36:37.154
And my brain...

1:36:38.199 --> 1:36:40.110
Jumps...

1:36:41.240 --> 1:36:43.390
For joy

1:36:44.319 --> 1:36:46.389
It...

1:36:46.560 --> 1:36:48.551
Jumps...

1:36:49.840 --> 1:36:51.956
For joy

1:36:52.760 --> 1:36:54.716
It...

1:36:54.879 --> 1:36:56.835
Jumps...

1:36:57.840 --> 1:36:59.876
For joy

1:37:00.999 --> 1:37:03.115
It...

1:37:03.400 --> 1:37:05.118
Jumps...

1:37:05.839 --> 1:37:07.830
For joy
