WEBVTT

00:12.333 --> 00:13.967
PREVIOUSLY ON
"GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:14.000 --> 00:16.800
(Izzie) GEORGE'S DAD
GOT ADMITTED LAST NIGHT.
I MET A SISTER
I NEVER KNEW I HAD.

00:16.833 --> 00:21.133
(Izzie) CAN YOU IMAGINE--A WHOLE
FAMILY YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT?

00:21.167 --> 00:23.500
I'M JUST ASKING
ABOUT YOUR DAD.
WHY DO YOU CARE?

00:23.533 --> 00:24.833
YOU BROKE UP WITH ME,
REMEMBER?

00:24.867 --> 00:27.433
MR. O'MALLEY HAS ELECTED
TO HAVE DR. HAHN

00:27.467 --> 00:29.533
PERFORM HIS VALVE REPLACEMENT.
I CAN CLEAR YOU FOR SURGERY.

00:29.567 --> 00:31.300
YOU'RE SURE?
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

00:31.333 --> 00:34.133
I NEED YOU TO TELL ME
WHY YOU DIDN'T WANT ME IN

00:34.167 --> 00:36.200
ON YOUR SURGERY.
I'M AFRAID
I JUST COULDN'T USE YOU.

00:36.233 --> 00:38.267
I CAN'T SEE YOUR MOTHER
ANYMORE.

00:38.300 --> 00:41.500
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO RETIRE, RICHARD.
(Preston) I'M GOING TO BE CHIEF.

00:41.533 --> 00:43.400
I HAD A TREMOR AND I DIDN'T
SAY ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

00:43.433 --> 00:46.767
WE CROSSED THE LINE.
YOU DRAGGED ME
ACROSS THE LINE.

00:56.067 --> 00:57.400
HE'S WITH HER.

00:57.433 --> 00:59.167
HE'S WITH THAT WOMAN--
HIS WIFE.

00:59.200 --> 01:01.100
I DON'T THINK HE IS,
NOT ANYMORE.

01:01.133 --> 01:03.067
HE IS. I MEAN,
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

01:03.067 --> 01:06.433
HE LOVES ME. (scoffs) I MEAN,
WHY WOULD HE GO BACK TO HER?

01:06.467 --> 01:09.667
I GAVE UP EVERYTHING
FOR HIM.

01:09.700 --> 01:11.067
MOM.

01:13.167 --> 01:15.533
MOM, LOOK AT ME.

01:17.400 --> 01:21.667
THIS HAPPENED...
A VERY LONG TIME AGO.

01:21.700 --> 01:24.333
THIS IS NOT HAPPENING NOW.

01:28.833 --> 01:31.267
IT'S BECAUSE I HAVE
A DAUGHTER, ISN'T IT?

01:31.300 --> 01:34.100
HE ALWAYS SAID
HE DIDN'T WANT KIDS.

01:34.133 --> 01:36.367
I SHOULD NEVER
HAVE HAD A KID.

01:51.067 --> 01:52.433
(Richard clears throat)

01:54.800 --> 01:56.267
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
TO THEM?

01:56.300 --> 01:57.767
WHAT?

01:57.800 --> 01:59.300
DR. BURKE AND DR. YANG--

01:59.333 --> 02:01.533
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
TO THEM,

02:01.567 --> 02:03.200
THEIR PUNISHMENT?
DR. BAILEY--

02:03.233 --> 02:05.100
THERE'S A NEED
FOR JUSTICE HERE.

02:05.133 --> 02:06.167
JUSTICE?

02:06.200 --> 02:08.333
JUSTICE HAS NO DEFINITION
WITHIN THE FOUR WALLS

02:08.367 --> 02:09.733
OF A HOSPITAL, DR. BAILEY.

02:09.767 --> 02:11.467
THIS ISN'T A COURT OF LAW.

02:11.500 --> 02:13.500
I JUST WANT TO KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA BE DONE.

02:13.533 --> 02:16.067
LEGALLY AND TECHNICALLY,
THEY'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG.

02:16.067 --> 02:17.833
NOBODY DIED,
THERE WAS NO MALPRACTICE.

02:17.867 --> 02:19.267
I HAVEN'T MADE A DECISION.

02:19.300 --> 02:20.600
EXCUSE ME. HE--

02:20.633 --> 02:23.067
HE WHAT?

02:23.067 --> 02:24.733
NOTHIN'.

02:24.767 --> 02:26.233
DR. YANG,

02:26.267 --> 02:28.167
YOU'LL GO BACK ON THE FLOOR
WITH DR. BAILEY.

02:28.200 --> 02:30.633
SIR--
DR. BAILEY, AM I NOT
UNDERSTANDING THIS?

02:30.667 --> 02:34.367
DOES THIS SITUATION DIRECTLY
HARM YOU IN SOME WAY?

02:34.400 --> 02:36.167
NO, SIR.

02:36.200 --> 02:38.133
I AM FINE.

02:38.167 --> 02:39.600
THEN GET BACK TO WORK.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.300
BURKE, YOU AND SHEPHERD
NEED TO COME TOGETHER

02:45.333 --> 02:47.600
ON THIS TREMOR
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

02:47.633 --> 02:49.467
HE DOESN'T WANT MY HELP.
DEREK--

02:49.500 --> 02:50.667
I DON'T WANT HIS HELP.

02:50.700 --> 02:52.533
THAT HAND
IS WORTH $2 MILLION.

02:52.567 --> 02:56.200
I WANT IT FIXED,
AND I WANT IT FIXED YESTERDAY.

02:56.233 --> 02:57.500
FIGURE IT OUT.

02:57.533 --> 02:59.433
LISTEN, YOUR BROTHERS
ARE GOOD BOYS,

02:59.467 --> 03:01.367
BUT THEY'RE NOT
THAT RESPONSIBLE.

03:01.400 --> 03:03.300
IT'S A STANDARD PROCEDURE.

03:03.333 --> 03:06.100
IT'S JUST THAT,
IF THINGS GO WRONG--
DAD--

03:07.767 --> 03:09.633
THE LIFE INSURANCE PAPERS

03:09.667 --> 03:12.567
ARE IN THE SECOND DRAWER
IN MY NIGHTSTAND...

03:12.600 --> 03:16.533
AND MY... MAGAZINES
ARE IN THE GARAGE

03:16.567 --> 03:18.467
WITH THE TRUCK MANUALS.
YOUR MAGAZINES?

03:18.500 --> 03:21.633
GET 'EM OUTTA THERE
SO YOUR MA DOESN'T SEE THEM.

03:21.667 --> 03:23.300
YOUR MAGAZINES?

03:23.333 --> 03:26.067
(clears throat)
GOOD MORNING, MR. O'MALLEY.

03:26.100 --> 03:28.267
JUST WANTED TO STOP BY
BEFORE THE SURGERY

03:28.300 --> 03:30.433
AND SEE HOW THAT COLLARBONE
WAS HEALING.

03:33.200 --> 03:36.667
GEORGE... YOU'RE NOT GONNA SAY
HELLO TO DR. TORRES?

03:39.067 --> 03:42.433
I'M GONNA SEE YOU
FOR ROUNDS, DAD.

03:45.267 --> 03:48.133
HAD YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU WERE
DEVELOPING A TREMOR,

03:48.167 --> 03:49.500
I COULD'VE RUN SOME TESTS.

03:49.533 --> 03:51.800
YOU COULD HAVE.
YEAH.

03:51.833 --> 03:53.733
THE LIKELIHOOD IS THAT
THERE'S JUST SOME COMPRESSION

03:53.767 --> 03:55.667
OF THE STRUCTURES
AROUND THE INJURY.

03:55.700 --> 03:57.600
I CAN GO IN THERE--
I DON'T WANT ANOTHER SURGERY.

03:57.633 --> 03:59.533
IT COULD BE A SMALL CLOT.
I JUST GO IN--

03:59.567 --> 04:01.733
SHEPHERD, I DON'T WANT
ANOTHER SURGERY.

04:01.767 --> 04:03.733
THE FIRST ONE
CAUSED ENOUGH DAMAGE.

04:03.767 --> 04:06.433
I CAN DO THIS.
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID
THE LAST TIME.

04:06.467 --> 04:08.400
NOW I HAVE A TREMOR.

04:10.467 --> 04:13.133
(sighs)

04:13.167 --> 04:15.067
MAYBE SHE'LL BE ON "LOOK
BUT DON'T TOUCH" PATROL, TOO.

04:15.100 --> 04:16.833
AT LEAST I'D HAVE
SOME COMPANY.

04:16.867 --> 04:18.767
WHATEVER SHE GETS,
I HOPE IT'S BAD,

04:18.800 --> 04:20.800
REALLY BAD.
SHE MADE A MISTAKE.

04:20.833 --> 04:23.167
A MISTAKE?
WE ALL--

04:23.200 --> 04:25.233
SHE WAS GONNA LET BURKE--
BURKE WITH THE SHAKY HAND--

04:25.267 --> 04:27.500
OPERATE ON MY FATHER.

04:35.633 --> 04:37.533
COULD YOU STOP LOOKING
AT ME LIKE THAT?

04:37.567 --> 04:40.833
IT'S CREEPY, AND IT MAKES ME
FEEL LIKE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN FED.

04:40.867 --> 04:43.533
(locker door slams)

04:46.667 --> 04:48.167
HOW'S IT GOING?

04:48.200 --> 04:49.533
HOW'S WHAT GOING?

04:49.567 --> 04:51.467
YOU AND BURKE,

04:51.500 --> 04:53.067
ARE YOU OKAY?

04:53.067 --> 04:55.333
(exhales) WE'RE EXISTING
IN TOTAL SILENCE.

04:55.367 --> 04:56.533
HE'S NOT TALKING TO YOU?

04:56.567 --> 04:58.467
I'M NOT TALKING
TO HIM EITHER.

04:58.500 --> 05:01.100
I'M SORRY.
ARE YOU OKAY?

05:01.133 --> 05:04.167
STOP ASKING ME THAT.
I'M MAKING AN EFFORT HERE.

05:04.200 --> 05:05.533
PLEASE DON'T.

05:05.567 --> 05:08.700
ROUNDS STARTED 30 SECONDS AGO.

05:08.733 --> 05:11.067
THE CHIEF MAY BE CONFUSED
ABOUT PUNISHMENT FOR YOU,

05:11.100 --> 05:12.567
BUT I'M NOT.

05:12.600 --> 05:13.800
YOU'RE LATE AGAIN,

05:13.833 --> 05:16.567
YOU WILL FIND
ANOTHER RESIDENT.

05:17.700 --> 05:19.600
DR. BAILEY,
CAN I HAVE GREY?

05:19.633 --> 05:21.733
YOU CAN HAVE 'EM ALL.

05:21.767 --> 05:24.333
SOMETHING YOU NEEDED,
DR. MONTGOMERY?
THIS IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS,

05:24.367 --> 05:27.400
BUT I JUST THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
WANT TO BE WARNED.
I'M SORRY. I DON'T KNOW--

05:27.433 --> 05:29.300
YOUR SISTER MOLLY'S
JUST BEEN ADMITTED

05:29.333 --> 05:31.233
FOR AN EMERGENCY C-SECTION.
MOLLY'S NOT MY SISTER.

05:31.267 --> 05:32.700
OKAY, BUT TECHNICALLY,
SHE IS,

05:32.733 --> 05:34.667
YOU HAVE THE SAME FATHER.

05:34.700 --> 05:36.767
AND, UH, SUSAN--
SUSAN GREY
IS DEFINITELY NOT MY MOTHER.

05:36.800 --> 05:39.767
I APPRECIATE YOU'RE TRYING
TO BE NICE AND EVERYTHING,

05:39.800 --> 05:42.400
BUT I REALLY DON'T EVEN
NEED TO KNOW THIS, SO--

05:42.433 --> 05:44.433
ACTUALLY YOU DO.
(clears throat)

05:45.567 --> 05:48.300
HELLO, MEREDITH.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.300
HI, MOM.

05:51.333 --> 05:54.767
HONEY. OH.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.700
I PUT OUT SOME BREAKFAST

05:56.733 --> 05:59.267
IN CASE YOU KIDS
HAVEN'T EATEN YET.
SCORE.

05:59.300 --> 06:00.700
KAREV.

06:00.733 --> 06:02.700
HEY, READY FOR
THE BIG DAY, POPS?
MM, FOOD.

06:02.733 --> 06:04.367
OH.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.300
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S MAKE THIS FAST, PEOPLE.

06:06.333 --> 06:09.367
I HAVE A DAY. WHICH ONE
OF THE INTERNS IS MINE?
IT'S MINE.

06:09.400 --> 06:11.533
HE'S FAMILY,
AND SHE'S A CANDY STRIPER.
I'M READY.

06:11.567 --> 06:14.067
WHAT IF YOU DID PICK ME?
WHAT IF YOU PICKED ME?
(Ronny and Jerry) PICK ME!

06:14.067 --> 06:15.833
GUYS, THIS IS SERIOUS.

06:15.867 --> 06:17.400
YANG.

06:17.433 --> 06:18.700
WHAT?

06:18.733 --> 06:20.600
(Alex, Izzie and Cristina)
WHAT?

06:20.633 --> 06:23.167
DR. HAHN, CRISTINA IS
VERY GOOD WITH CARDIO.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.467
I'M SURE YOU CAN USE HER
FOR THE DAY.

06:25.500 --> 06:26.567
UH...

06:26.600 --> 06:30.067
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR,
YANG? PRESENT THE CASE.

06:30.100 --> 06:32.400
HAROLD O'MALLEY, 63, DIAGNOSED
WITH ESOPHAGEAL CANCER

06:32.433 --> 06:34.133
AND SEVERE AORTIC REGURGE,

06:34.167 --> 06:37.100
IS SCHEDULED FOR AORTIC VALVE
REPLACEMENT THIS AFTERNOON.

06:37.133 --> 06:39.267
DUDE, I WANTED THAT SURGERY,
AND SHE HANDS IT TO YANG.

06:39.300 --> 06:41.200
I HAVEN'T HAD
A CARDIAC CASE IN AGES.

06:41.233 --> 06:44.167
IT'S NOT A CASE.
IT'S MY FATHER.
I GUESS THERE'S
A DOUBLE STANDARD NOW.

06:44.200 --> 06:45.667
(Izzie)
YANG DOES SOMETHING WRONG,

06:45.700 --> 06:48.067
AND SHE GETS REWARDED.
THAT'S FAIR.
YEAH.

06:48.067 --> 06:49.800
IF YOU THUMB SUCKERS
DON'T STOP WHINING,

06:49.833 --> 06:52.567
I SWEAR I WON'T SHOW YOU
WHAT'S BEHIND THIS DOOR,

06:52.600 --> 06:55.600
AND TRUST ME, YOU WANT TO SEE
WHAT'S BEHIND THIS DOOR.

06:58.300 --> 07:01.833
EXCUSE ME, DOCTORS, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO WAIT A FEW MINUTES.

07:01.867 --> 07:04.200
HE'S GOTTA PEE. EVERY FIVE
MINUTES, HE'S GOTTA PEE.

07:04.233 --> 07:06.067
I'VE ALWAYS HAD
A SMALL BLADDER.
I CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS
ANY LONGER.

07:06.100 --> 07:08.700
YOU? I'M THE ONE WHO HAS TO
PUT UP WITH YOUR WHINING.

07:08.733 --> 07:12.200
LIKE THE WHINING
YOU'RE DOING RIGHT NOW?

07:12.233 --> 07:14.200
(men arguing indistinctly)

07:19.367 --> 07:22.767
NOW WHICH ONE OF YOU THINKS
THAT YANG GOT THE BETTER CASE?

07:25.167 --> 07:31.333
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

07:32.467 --> 07:33.800
JAKE AND PETER WEITZMAN,

07:33.833 --> 07:36.833
35-YEAR-OLD PYGOPAGUS
CONJOINED TWINS

07:36.867 --> 07:38.733
ATTACHED AT
THE LUMBOSACRAL JUNCTION.

07:38.767 --> 07:40.633
BUT NOT FOR LONG,
RIGHT, DR. WEBBER?

07:40.667 --> 07:42.833
THE WEITZMANS CAME
ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO

07:42.867 --> 07:44.600
FOR A SEPARATION PROCEDURE.

07:44.633 --> 07:46.733
THEY OPTED OUT
BECAUSE OF THE RISK.
PETE CHICKENED OUT.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.800
WELL, FORGIVE ME FOR WANTING
TO LIVE LONGER,

07:48.833 --> 07:50.067
EVEN IF IT MEANT
LIVING WITH YOU.

07:50.067 --> 07:52.733
YEAH? WELL, YOU WASTED
SIX MONTHS OF OUR LIVES...
OH, COME ON.

07:52.767 --> 07:54.100
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
STOP IT.

07:54.133 --> 07:56.167
YOU GUYS CAME BACK
AT THE RIGHT TIME.

07:56.200 --> 07:57.800
WE JUST SCORED NEW YORK'S
TOP PLASTIC SURGEON.

07:57.833 --> 08:00.300
(Richard) MARK SLOAN, PLASTICS,
AND YOU REMEMBER DR. SHEPHERD,

08:00.333 --> 08:01.633
YOUR NEUROSURGEON.
(Derek) JAKE.

08:01.667 --> 08:04.267
WE, UH, WE USED TO WORK
AS A TEAM, ACTUALLY.
PETE, GOOD TO SEE YOU.

08:04.300 --> 08:06.133
WE WORKED TOGETHER. WE WERE
NEVER ACTUALLY A TEAM.

08:06.167 --> 08:07.567
(Jake) I HEAR YA.
MR. WEITZMAN?

08:07.600 --> 08:09.167
CALL ME JAKE.
CALL ME PETE.

08:09.200 --> 08:11.500
JAKE, PETE, UM, WHY--
DO YOU MIND ME ASKING WHY NOW

08:11.533 --> 08:14.100
WHEN YOU THOUGHT THE PROCEDURE
WAS TOO RISKY SIX MONTHS AGO?

08:14.133 --> 08:15.733
WELL--

08:15.767 --> 08:17.133
GUYS.

08:17.167 --> 08:18.633
WHOA.

08:18.667 --> 08:20.067
THAT'S A LOT OF DOCTORS.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.767
I'M--I'M JUST GONNA
COME BACK LATER.

08:21.800 --> 08:24.067
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
ELENA, COME IN, COME IN.

08:24.067 --> 08:26.200
YOU WANTED TO KNOW WHY NOW.
THIS IS WHY--

08:26.233 --> 08:28.433
THE LOVE OF MY LIFE--
ELENA.

08:28.467 --> 08:31.433
JAKE, DON'T--I-I TOLD HIM
NOT TO DO THIS,

08:31.467 --> 08:34.300
NOT FOR ME ANYWAY,
'CAUSE THAT'S JUST CRAZY.

08:34.333 --> 08:36.233
'CAUSE PETE SAID THAT
THEY COULD END UP PARALYZED.

08:36.267 --> 08:37.700
THEY COULD END UP DEAD.

08:37.733 --> 08:39.633
WHAT DO YOU TELL HER
THINGS LIKE THAT FOR?

08:39.667 --> 08:41.567
I WASN'T TELLING HER.
I WAS TELLING YOU.

08:41.600 --> 08:44.067
SHE JUST HAPPENS TO BE
THE ONLY ONE WHO LISTENS TO ME.

08:44.067 --> 08:45.567
SHE HAPPENS TO BE RIGHT.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.400
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO HAVE TO BE STUCK

08:47.433 --> 08:48.800
TO THE SAME PERSON--
HERE WE GO.

08:48.833 --> 08:51.367
EVERY--THAT'S RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
HERE WE--

08:51.400 --> 08:54.267
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO
HAVE TO BE WITH THE SAME PERSON

08:54.300 --> 08:55.500
EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY DAY,

08:55.533 --> 08:57.433
TO NOT HAVE ANYTHING
THAT'S JUST YOURS,

08:57.467 --> 08:59.367
NOT BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING
ON YOUR OWN?

08:59.400 --> 09:02.667
WELL, NOBODY SHOULD HAVE TO
LIVE LIKE THAT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK, PETE?

09:02.700 --> 09:05.567
I THINK, WHY WOULD I WANT TO BE
ATTACHED TO SOMEONE

09:05.600 --> 09:08.067
WHO DOESN'T WANT TO BE
ATTACHED TO ME?

09:11.567 --> 09:13.467
(Alex) I'M CALLING IT.
IT'S MINE.

09:13.500 --> 09:15.567
I HAVE TWO BROTHERS.
I FEEL THEIR PAIN.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.667
I WOULD BE GREAT
AT WATCHING THIS.
ZIP IT, ALL OF YOU.

09:17.700 --> 09:19.600
WE'RE ON THE CASE, RIGHT?
RIGHT.

09:19.633 --> 09:21.067
YES!
AWESOME.

09:21.067 --> 09:22.400
STEVENS, YOU ARE TO--

09:22.433 --> 09:24.333
LOOK AND NOT TOUCH OR SPEAK
OR BREATHE. I GOT IT.

09:24.367 --> 09:26.200
SO THIS IS
THE CRACK TEAM, HUH?

09:26.233 --> 09:28.233
FEEL FREE TO TAKE ONE.
HOW ABOUT I TAKE THE ONE

09:28.267 --> 09:30.733
THAT DOESN'T TOUCH
OR SPEAK OR BREATHE?
(whispers) RIGHT.

09:30.767 --> 09:33.500
DAMN IT.

09:33.533 --> 09:35.500
THANK YOU...
FOR PICKING ME.

09:35.533 --> 09:37.600
EVEN JUST OBSERVING
WOULD BE--

09:37.633 --> 09:40.733
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE FUN
TO LOOK AT WHILE I WORK.

09:40.767 --> 09:42.667
WILL YOU BE WORKING ON
BOTH THE NERVE GRAFT

09:42.700 --> 09:44.367
AND THE SKIN RECONSTRUCTION?

09:44.400 --> 09:47.267
YES, AND I THINK I'LL
HANDLE THEM A WHOLE LOT BETTER

09:47.300 --> 09:49.100
WITH A LITTLE CAFFEINE
IN MY SYSTEM.

09:49.133 --> 09:51.233
GET ME A BLUEBERRY SCONE,
A BONE DRY CAPPUCCINO

09:51.267 --> 09:53.167
AND A LITTLE SOMETHING
FOR YOURSELF.

09:53.200 --> 09:55.100
THERE'S A CAFETERIA
ON THE SECOND FLOOR

09:55.133 --> 09:57.733
AND A COFFEE CART
IN THE LOBBY.
FEISTY.

09:57.767 --> 09:59.500
CAPPUCCINO.

09:59.533 --> 10:02.300
YOU CAN KICK ME BACK TO BAILEY
IF YOU WANT. I DON'T DO COFFEE.

10:02.333 --> 10:04.600
SO HOW WILL YOU BE HANDLING
THE NERVE GRAFT

10:04.633 --> 10:06.567
AND THE SKIN RECONSTRUCTION?

10:06.600 --> 10:08.600
CONJOINED TWINS, DEREK.

10:08.633 --> 10:10.467
(Derek) I KNOW, CHIEF.

10:10.500 --> 10:13.333
CONJOINED ADULT TWINS.

10:13.367 --> 10:14.433
MM-HMM.

10:14.467 --> 10:17.133
I MEAN, IT'S RARE ENOUGH
TO SEPARATE CONJOINED INFANTS.

10:17.167 --> 10:19.167
BUT CONJOINED ADULTS?
MM-HMM.

10:19.200 --> 10:22.033
CAN YOU IMAGINE THE PRESS,
WHAT A SURGERY LIKE THIS

10:22.067 --> 10:23.400
COULD DO FOR THIS HOSPITAL?

10:23.433 --> 10:25.667
I KNOW, WHICH IS WHY
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD DO IT.

10:25.700 --> 10:27.767
THEIR SPINES ARE FUSED TOGETHER
FROM THE L4 DOWN.

10:27.800 --> 10:30.033
THEIR BLOOD FLOW
IS INTRICATELY CONNECTED.

10:30.067 --> 10:32.100
THEY COULD END UP PARALYZED,
OR EVEN DEAD.

10:33.467 --> 10:37.100
YOUR PATIENTS WANT
THIS OPERATION, DEREK.

10:37.133 --> 10:38.833
WHY ARE YOU BACKING OUT?

10:38.867 --> 10:41.233
THIS ISN'T LIKE YOU.

10:41.267 --> 10:43.767
UNLESS THERE'S
INCONTROVERTIBLE EVIDENCE

10:43.800 --> 10:47.067
THAT THIS SURGERY CAN'T BE DONE,
WE'RE MOVING FORWARD.

10:47.100 --> 10:49.800
(sighs)

10:49.833 --> 10:51.633
YOUR FATHER'S NOT HERE.

10:51.667 --> 10:53.567
THATCHER'S AT HARVARD MED
VISITING LEXIE.

10:53.600 --> 10:56.567
WE THOUGHT WE HAD
A LOT OF TIME.

10:56.600 --> 10:58.500
I MEAN, MOLLY'S ONLY
36 WEEKS,

10:58.533 --> 11:00.800
AND DR. MONTGOMERY'S BEEN
TRYING TO STOP THE CONTRACTIONS,

11:00.833 --> 11:02.733
BUT I GUESS THE BABY
IS READY TO COME OUT.

11:02.767 --> 11:04.667
WELL, DO YOU NEED
ANYTHING ELSE OR...

11:04.700 --> 11:06.600
YEAH, ACTUALLY, I COULD USE
AN INTERN FOR THIS.

11:06.633 --> 11:09.433
CAN YOU ASK DR. BAILEY
FOR SOMEONE?

11:09.467 --> 11:12.067
UH... I'LL DO IT.

11:12.067 --> 11:14.767
ARE YOU SURE?
YEAH, I'M FINE.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.200
OKAY.

11:16.233 --> 11:18.333
IT'LL BE SO NICE TO HAVE
A FAMILIAR FACE

11:18.367 --> 11:20.267
IN THE OPERATING ROOM.

11:20.300 --> 11:21.533
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.

11:21.567 --> 11:25.633
IT'S MY JOB TO BE HERE, SO...

11:25.667 --> 11:27.533
UH, DOES MOLLY KNOW
WHO I AM?

11:27.567 --> 11:29.100
SHE DOESN'T.

11:29.133 --> 11:31.100
I WANTED TO TELL HER,
BUT YOUR FATHER...

11:31.133 --> 11:33.067
HE JUST--HE--
NO, IT'S--IT'S BETTER.

11:33.067 --> 11:35.800
IT'S BETTER THAT SHE
NOT KNOW. IT'S GOOD.

11:35.833 --> 11:37.700
SO I THINK, UH, MOLLY SHOULD
BE READY IN THE O.R.

11:37.733 --> 11:40.567
SUSAN, YOU'LL NEED SCRUBS
AND A CAP.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.567
I'M ABOUT TO BE
A GRANDMOTHER.

11:42.600 --> 11:45.400
YES, IN ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR,
YOU WILL BE A GRANDMOTHER.

11:45.433 --> 11:47.333
OH, MY. OKAY.
HERE WE GO.

11:47.367 --> 11:49.333
HERE WE GO.

11:49.367 --> 11:51.533
HERE WE GO.

11:51.567 --> 11:53.467
WE'RE GOING TO BE REPLACING
YOUR AORTIC VALVE

11:53.500 --> 11:55.400
WITH A PORCINE VALVE.

11:55.433 --> 11:57.333
WELL, GEORGIE SAYS
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

11:57.367 --> 11:59.467
HE SAYS THEY KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

11:59.500 --> 12:00.600
BESIDES, IF YOU DIE,
I'LL KILL YOU.

12:00.633 --> 12:03.267
WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING
WE'RE DOING THIS TODAY.

12:03.300 --> 12:05.467
WE NOTICED YOU HAD A LOT
OF IRREGULAR HEART RHYTHMS

12:05.500 --> 12:08.300
THIS MORNING.
DID YOU CHECK HIS DIG LEVEL?

12:08.333 --> 12:09.367
EXCUSE ME.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:09.400 --> 12:12.367
THIS MORNING HIS POTASSIUM
WAS A BORDERLINE LOW.

12:12.400 --> 12:16.300
ALL RIGHT, WE'VE GOT A HANDLE
ON THINGS HERE.
OH, I'M SURE YOU DO.

12:18.100 --> 12:20.467
UH, GEORGE, I THINK MAYBE
YOU SHOULD STEP OUTSIDE.

12:20.500 --> 12:23.667
YOU DON'T TALK TO ME
LIKE THAT.
OH, SHE'S WAKING UP
THE BABY.

12:23.700 --> 12:26.500
RONNY, SHUT UP.
BE CAREFUL, DR. HAHN,
HE MIGHT START CRYING.

12:26.533 --> 12:29.167
I SAID SHUT UP.
ALL RIGHT,
YOU ARE OUT OF HERE.

12:29.200 --> 12:31.367
NO, I'M NOT.

12:31.400 --> 12:34.333
GEORGIE.
NO, UH, SHE CAN'T
KICK ME OUT.

12:34.367 --> 12:37.700
SHE HAS NO RIGHT.
I HIRED HER.

12:37.733 --> 12:40.600
I'M STAYING.

12:40.633 --> 12:42.533
(Addison)
HOW YOU DOING THERE, MOLLY?

12:42.567 --> 12:44.700
OKAY. I'M JUST EXCITED
TO SEE MY GIRL.

12:44.733 --> 12:47.067
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA GET
TO TAKE A LOOK AT HER

12:47.067 --> 12:48.900
IN JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES.

12:48.933 --> 12:53.167
DR. GREY, CAN YOU GIVE ME
A LITTLE MORE TRACTION, PLEASE?
(woman) VITALS ARE
HOLDING STEADY.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.100
CAN YOU SEE HER YET?
(chuckles) NO.

12:55.133 --> 12:58.367
I'M NOT GONNA LOOK
UNTIL THE BLOOD'S ALL GONE.

12:58.400 --> 13:01.800
OKAY. YOU WANT TO CUT
THE CORD, DR. GREY?

13:01.833 --> 13:04.833
(woman) THE WARMER IS READY
WHEN YOU NEED IT,

13:04.867 --> 13:06.633
DR. MONTGOMERY.

13:06.667 --> 13:08.633
DR. GREY,
WILL YOU FOLLOW ME?

13:08.667 --> 13:10.500
DR. KNOX, WILL YOU
CLOSE FOR ME, PLEASE?

13:10.533 --> 13:11.633
BAG VALVE MASK.

13:11.667 --> 13:15.133
WE HAVE TO STABILIZE THIS BABY
AND GET IT INTO SURGERY.

13:15.167 --> 13:17.667
(woman) GET HER ON THE MONITOR.
THE PULSE IS WEAK.
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

13:17.700 --> 13:21.267
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?
SUSAN, I NEED YOU TO STAND BACK
AND STAY WITH MOLLY, PLEASE.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.667
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?
(woman) NO RESPONSE TO
STIMULATION. LET'S TRY SUCTION.

13:23.700 --> 13:25.767
(Addison) GREY, YOU WANT TO
TALK HER THROUGH THIS?

13:25.800 --> 13:28.433
GREY, I NEED YOUR HELP HERE.

13:32.100 --> 13:34.700
THE BABY IS NOT BREATHING.

13:34.733 --> 13:36.567
(Molly) WHAT?

13:36.600 --> 13:40.333
WHAT DID SHE SAY?

13:49.100 --> 13:50.833
YOU LEFT ME HANGING
IN THERE, GREY.

13:50.867 --> 13:52.767
I'M SORRY. I WAS...
I'M SORRY.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.800
DO YOU NEED ME
TO SCRUB IN ON THE BABY?

13:54.833 --> 13:56.533
NO. I WANT YOU TO KEEP
MOLLY AND HER MOTHER

13:56.567 --> 13:58.467
APPRISED OF THE BABY'S CONDITION
WHILE I OPERATE.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.067
I'M SURE
THEY'D RATHER TALK TO YOU.

14:00.067 --> 14:02.600
THE BABY'S GOT JEJUNAL ATRESIA.
SHE MAY DIE.

14:02.633 --> 14:04.733
I GOT CONSENT, BUT I DON'T
HAVE TIME FOR UPDATES.

14:04.767 --> 14:06.667
I THINK I WOULD
REALLY LEARN A LOT

14:06.700 --> 14:08.733
FROM OBSERVING
THIS PROCEDURE.
NO, IT WAS A MISTAKE

14:08.767 --> 14:11.633
TO LET YOU IN THE O.R. WITH
YOUR FAMILY IN THE FIRST PLACE.

14:11.667 --> 14:16.200
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN.
CHECK IN WITH ME EVERY HOUR.

14:16.233 --> 14:18.800
HOW MANY VALVE REPLACEMENTS
HAVE YOU PERFORMED

14:18.833 --> 14:20.333
IN YOUR LIFE, DR. O'MALLEY?
NONE.

14:20.367 --> 14:22.133
NONE. AND HOW MANY
VALVE REPLACEMENTS DO YOU THINK

14:22.167 --> 14:23.767
DR. HAHN HAS PERFORMED?
THAT IS MY FATHER!

14:23.800 --> 14:25.533
AND YOU ARE IN THAT ROOM
AS HIS SON.

14:25.567 --> 14:27.533
YOU INTERNS THINK YOU CAN DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO.

14:27.567 --> 14:28.800
WELL, NOT ANYMORE,
NOT WITH ME,

14:28.833 --> 14:30.600
WHICH IS WHY YOU
ARE GOING TO STAY AWAY,

14:30.633 --> 14:32.267
50 FEET AWAY
TO BE PRECISE.

14:32.300 --> 14:34.367
YOU ARE GOING TO REMAIN
50 FEET AWAY FROM YOUR FATHER

14:34.400 --> 14:36.433
AT ALL TIMES TODAY,
AND, DR. O'MALLEY,

14:36.467 --> 14:39.233
DO NOT MAKE ME
TELL YOU AGAIN.

14:44.633 --> 14:46.533
EVERYTHING OKAY
WITH THE O'MALLEYS?

14:46.567 --> 14:48.800
THE KID'S A PAIN
IN THE ASS.

14:48.833 --> 14:51.067
BUT DR. YANG HERE
IS PROVING TO BE

14:51.067 --> 14:53.500
AN EXTREMELY CAPABLE ASSET.

14:53.533 --> 14:57.367
I HEAR SHE STUDIED UNDER YOU.
YOU TRAINED HER WELL.
YES.

14:57.400 --> 14:59.433
WELL, SHE'S VERY...

15:02.067 --> 15:04.067
PROFESSIONAL.

15:14.667 --> 15:17.367
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT DR. LEVINE?

15:17.400 --> 15:20.333
PRETTY GOOD.

15:20.367 --> 15:22.267
BETTER OR WORSE
THAN DR. KORSIKOV?

15:22.300 --> 15:23.633
WAIT...

15:23.667 --> 15:25.567
WHY ARE YOU
RESEARCHING NEUROSURGEONS

15:25.600 --> 15:27.500
WHEN YOU AND I BOTH KNOW

15:27.533 --> 15:29.433
THAT DEREK'S BETTER
THAN ANYBODY?

15:29.467 --> 15:31.367
I DON'T WANT SHEPHERD.

15:31.400 --> 15:32.767
YOU BLAMING THIS
ON HIM?

15:32.800 --> 15:35.700
YOU KNOW, UP UNTIL NOW,

15:35.733 --> 15:37.433
I HAVE NOT YELLED.

15:37.467 --> 15:39.500
I HAVE NOT YELLED

15:39.533 --> 15:41.433
BECAUSE YOU WERE A GUY
IN TROUBLE,

15:41.467 --> 15:43.433
AND I WAS SUPPORTING YOU.

15:43.467 --> 15:46.200
BUT NOW...
I AM YELLING!

15:46.233 --> 15:47.167
CHIEF.

15:47.200 --> 15:49.100
I AM YELLING
VERY LOUDLY!

15:49.133 --> 15:51.833
I WANT TO RETIRE, BURKE!
I WANT MY WIFE BACK!

15:51.867 --> 15:55.200
AND I PASSED
THE TORCH TO YOU!

15:55.233 --> 15:58.667
I PASSED THE TORCH TO YOU,
AND YOU BLEW IT OUT!

15:58.700 --> 16:01.300
LOOK, I KNOW
I LET YOU DOWN.

16:05.533 --> 16:08.267
BURKE...

16:08.300 --> 16:10.467
I'M TIRED.

16:10.500 --> 16:14.167
I'M TIRED OF YOU MEN
ACTING LIKE BOYS.

16:14.200 --> 16:16.233
YOU LET ME DOWN.

16:16.267 --> 16:19.067
AND IF YOU DON'T LET DEREK
FIX THAT HAND,

16:19.067 --> 16:22.167
YOU'RE LETTING YOURSELF DOWN.

16:22.200 --> 16:25.633
(door opens)

16:25.667 --> 16:28.067
22 SURGEONS--

16:28.100 --> 16:31.433
IT TAKES 22 SURGEONS
TO DO THIS.

16:31.467 --> 16:33.167
SO WHERE ARE WE?

16:33.200 --> 16:35.200
I'VE GOTTEN TO
THE CAUDA EQUINA.

16:35.233 --> 16:36.267
I'LL BE WORKING

16:36.300 --> 16:38.533
ON THE MUSCULATURE
OF THE PERINEAL FLOOR.

16:38.567 --> 16:41.267
I'LL BE HARVESTING
THE SURAL NERVE FOR TRANSFER.

16:41.300 --> 16:43.600
NOW ONCE
I RESECT THIS ARTERY,

16:43.633 --> 16:45.533
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
LESS THAN TWO MINUTES

16:45.567 --> 16:48.667
BEFORE ALL SENSATION
TO THESE NERVES ARE GONE.
I'M PRETTY SURE

16:48.700 --> 16:51.633
WE'LL HAVE ENOUGH NERVE TO
TRANSFER AND COVER THE DEFICITS.

16:51.667 --> 16:53.600
WE CAN DEFINITELY DO THIS.

16:53.633 --> 16:55.400
OH, DAMN IT.

16:55.433 --> 16:57.533
IT'S GONNA BE A LOT MORE
FRAGILE IN THE BODY.

16:57.567 --> 17:00.467
IT'S ONE THING IF THIS IS
A LIFE-OR-DEATH SITUATION

17:00.500 --> 17:03.100
AND THIS IS ALL WE CAN DO
TO SAVE THEM.

17:03.133 --> 17:05.267
BUT THESE GUYS ARE FINE.

17:05.300 --> 17:07.067
THIS ISN'T WORTH THE RISK.

17:07.100 --> 17:08.800
(instruments clank on tray)

17:13.200 --> 17:14.533
(knocks on door)

17:14.567 --> 17:16.067
HOW IS OUR BABY?

17:16.100 --> 17:18.400
SHE HAS
AN INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION,

17:18.433 --> 17:21.333
WHICH IS WHY
SHE COULDN'T BREATHE.

17:21.367 --> 17:24.267
DR. MONTGOMERY IS OPERATING
ON HER RIGHT NOW.

17:24.300 --> 17:26.433
I CAN'T DO THIS.
I CAN'T DO IT.

17:26.467 --> 17:28.333
YES, YOU CAN.
YES, YOU CAN.

17:28.367 --> 17:31.600
I AM RIGHT HERE, BABY,
AND DAD'S ON THE WAY.
I HAVE TO CALL ERIC.

17:31.633 --> 17:34.067
OKAY.
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO TELL HIM.

17:34.100 --> 17:36.667
THAT'S HER HUSBAND.
HE'S IN IRAQ.
I CAN'T TELL HIM THIS.

17:36.700 --> 17:39.467
HE'S GONNA WANT TO NAME HER,
AND I DON'T WANNA NAME HER

17:39.500 --> 17:42.200
'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG
SHE'S GONNA BE OURS.

17:42.233 --> 17:43.767
OH, NOW--SHH.
WE'LL CALL HIM TOGETHER.
OKAY.

17:43.800 --> 17:45.700
HE'S JUST GONNA BE HAPPY
TO HEAR YOUR VOICE.

17:45.733 --> 17:48.433
THE BABY'S GONNA BE OKAY.
YOU HEAR ME?

17:48.467 --> 17:50.767
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
SLOAN'S RIGHT HAND.

17:50.800 --> 17:52.700
YEAH, WELL, SLOAN
CAN KISS MY--

17:52.733 --> 17:53.800
OW.

17:53.833 --> 17:55.833
I HAVEN'T EVEN PUT
THE NEEDLE IN YET.

17:55.867 --> 17:58.067
SORRY. I'M JUST NOT
A BIG FAN OF PAIN.

17:58.100 --> 18:00.567
WELL, YOU'RE ABOUT TO HAVE
A FAIRLY EXTENSIVE

18:00.600 --> 18:02.333
AND PAINFUL SURGERY.
YOU THINK THIS IS
AN ELECTIVE PROCEDURE?

18:02.367 --> 18:04.267
(laughs) THAT WE'RE JUST
COMING IN HERE

18:04.300 --> 18:05.500
BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING
ON EACH OTHER'S NERVES?

18:05.533 --> 18:08.133
PLEASE, YOU WANT TO KNOW
THE REAL REASON?

18:08.167 --> 18:09.233
COME ON, JAKE.
SHE DOESN'T WANT--
IT'S BECAUSE--

18:09.267 --> 18:11.300
YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR--
IT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE RULES.

18:11.333 --> 18:12.567
RULES?

18:12.600 --> 18:14.300
YEAH, LIKE SAY ONE OF US
IS ON A DINNER DATE,

18:14.333 --> 18:16.500
ACCORDING TO THE RULES,
THE OTHER ONE'S

18:16.533 --> 18:18.433
SUPPOSED TO SIT THERE QUIETLY,
EAT HIS FALAFEL

18:18.467 --> 18:19.800
AND SHUT THE HELL UP.

18:19.833 --> 18:21.733
I TRY. IT'S JUST THE WAY
YOU TALK TO HER SOMETIMES--

18:21.767 --> 18:24.667
IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.
HOW IS IT
NONE OF MY BUSINESS?

18:24.700 --> 18:27.367
HE STICKS UP FOR ME, AND I
THINK THAT THAT'S KINDA NICE.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.467
OKAY, YOU DON'T
TALK TO HIM ANYMORE.
WHAT?

18:29.500 --> 18:32.333
OH, WE CAN'T EVEN
BE FRIENDS NOW?

18:32.367 --> 18:33.700
WE HAVE OTHER RULES, TOO.
OH.

18:33.733 --> 18:35.467
LIKE FOR WHEN WE'RE
WITH SOMEONE.

18:35.500 --> 18:37.233
GOT IT. SORT OF.

18:37.267 --> 18:39.167
NO LOOKING, NO TALKING,
NO TOUCHING.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.367
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

18:41.400 --> 18:43.367
OH, THIS IS GONNA END
BADLY.
(Jake and Pete
arguing indistinctly)

18:43.400 --> 18:46.767
I TOLD YOU,
I'M COMPLETELY FINE WITH IT.

18:46.800 --> 18:49.500
HOW ARE YOU OKAY WITH THE FACT
THAT HE'S TOUCHING YOU

18:49.533 --> 18:50.733
WHILE YOU'RE NAKED?

18:50.767 --> 18:52.400
UH...

18:52.433 --> 18:54.667
BE... CAUSE IT WASN'T
A BIG DEAL.

18:54.700 --> 18:57.533
AND IT WAS KINDA SWEET
AND...

18:57.567 --> 19:00.233
IT JUST--
IT WASN'T A BIG DEAL.

19:00.267 --> 19:01.567
WAIT, YOU...

19:01.600 --> 19:04.067
YOU LIKED IT.

19:04.100 --> 19:06.767
YOU ENJOYED IT.

19:09.733 --> 19:12.667
I'M... COMPLETELY
IN LOVE WITH YOU.

19:12.700 --> 19:15.700
THAT'S NOT EVEN--THAT--
YOU'RE--YOU'RE A GREAT GUY.

19:15.733 --> 19:18.467
AND, YOU KNOW,
WHEN WE MAKE LOVE,

19:18.500 --> 19:20.167
THE--IT'S--IT'S GREAT.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.333
IT'S--IT'S REALLY GREAT.

19:22.367 --> 19:24.333
AND I'VE NEVER
HAD THAT BEFORE AND--

19:24.367 --> 19:26.267
IT'S JUST THAT

19:26.300 --> 19:28.467
WHEN YOU FALL ASLEEP,

19:28.500 --> 19:31.767
THAT, UH, PETE AND I JUST--

19:31.800 --> 19:33.633
WE TALK.

19:33.667 --> 19:36.200
AND, UM...

19:36.233 --> 19:38.600
I REALLY LOVE THAT, TOO.

19:38.633 --> 19:39.567
ELENA.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.700
NO, NO.
NO, YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE.

19:41.733 --> 19:43.767
WHAT?

19:43.800 --> 19:45.067
HIM OR ME?

19:45.067 --> 19:48.200
WE'RE GONNA HAVE THIS SURGERY,
AND YOU CAN'T HAVE US BOTH.

19:48.233 --> 19:52.533
SO CHOOSE--HIM OR ME?

19:56.633 --> 19:59.500
SEE, THIS IS THE PART
WHERE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SAY,

19:59.533 --> 20:01.667
"YOU, JAKE. I CHOOSE YOU."

20:01.700 --> 20:04.300
I'M SO SORRY, JAKE.

20:04.333 --> 20:06.633
I'M SO SORRY.

20:06.667 --> 20:08.133
ELENA--

20:08.167 --> 20:09.633
OH, GOD!
(Alex) NO, NO, NO!

20:09.667 --> 20:11.233
I SWEAR TO GOD...
JAKE, IT'S--

20:11.267 --> 20:13.833
I AM GONNA KILL YOU!
OW! GET HIM OFF!

20:13.867 --> 20:16.100
***

20:16.133 --> 20:17.467
I THINK IT'S ROMANTIC--

20:17.500 --> 20:21.067
TWO BROTHERS FIGHTING...
OVER THE SAME WOMAN.

20:21.100 --> 20:23.167
YOU KNOW WHAT'S FREAKY?
THE WHOLE CONJOINED TWIN

20:23.200 --> 20:25.100
HAVING SEX IN FRONT OF
THE OTHER ONE THING.

20:25.133 --> 20:27.500
HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

20:27.533 --> 20:29.233
FAMILY IS COMPLICATED.

20:29.267 --> 20:31.400
YOU'RE HERE. YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
KICKED OUT OF THE PROGRAM YET.

20:31.433 --> 20:33.700
(Meredith) ALEX.
NO, NOT YET.
I'M STILL HERE.

20:33.733 --> 20:36.400
(man breathes raspily)

20:37.600 --> 20:39.400
HOW'D YOU DO IT?

20:39.433 --> 20:41.033
I MEAN, DID YOU HAVE SOME KIND
OF SIGNAL IN SURGERY

20:41.067 --> 20:43.633
SO THAT THE NURSES
WOULDN'T KNOW, OR DID YOU--
ALEX--

20:43.667 --> 20:46.533
WHAT? I MEAN, I'M JUST WONDERING
HOW TO GET AHEAD AROUND HERE.

20:46.567 --> 20:48.400
ME? I GET COFFEE FOR SLOAN.

20:48.433 --> 20:50.567
YANG--SHE GETS SURGERIES
NONE OF US WOULD GET.

20:50.600 --> 20:51.667
GOT A HEAD COUNT

20:51.700 --> 20:53.500
ON HOW MANY PATIENTS YOU TWO
LIED TO THE PAST MONTH?

20:53.533 --> 20:56.400
(Meredith) GEORGE.
LEAVE HER ALONE.

20:56.433 --> 20:59.567
HER PATIENTS LIVED
SO SHE GETS TO SCRUB IN.
IZZIE.

20:59.600 --> 21:03.067
MEREDITH, PLEASE, CAN YOU
JUST STOP DEFENDING ME?

21:03.067 --> 21:06.100
***

21:08.767 --> 21:10.733
(Harold) NO, PLEASE,
YOU'RE KILLING ME.

21:10.767 --> 21:12.667
(Callie)
WANT A ROAST BEEF SANDWICH?

21:12.700 --> 21:14.600
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE
A PIECE OF FRUIT?

21:14.633 --> 21:17.400
AH.
AH. NO, NO, NO, NO.
I'LL, UH, I'LL GO.

21:17.433 --> 21:19.200
NO, WAIT, WAIT.

21:19.233 --> 21:21.667
GEORGIE, YOU SHOULD
MAKE NICE WITH HER.
LOOK, DAD...

21:21.700 --> 21:24.300
NO, REALLY, MR. O'MALLEY,
IT'S FINE.
IT'S NOT FINE.

21:26.767 --> 21:31.700
GEORGE, YOU'RE SO ANGRY.
NO, I'M NOT.

21:31.733 --> 21:34.067
YOU'VE BEEN PICKING FIGHTS
EVERY CHANCE YOU GET,

21:34.067 --> 21:35.533
AND THAT'S NOT LIKE YOU.

21:35.567 --> 21:37.500
DAD... YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON.

21:37.533 --> 21:39.133
OKAY, THEN TELL ME.

21:39.167 --> 21:42.233
WHY ARE YOU SO MAD
AT DR. TORRES?

21:42.267 --> 21:44.767
I SHOULD GO.
I HAVE PATIENTS TO SEE.
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:44.800 --> 21:46.333
I'M GONNA GO.

21:46.367 --> 21:48.333
NO! EVERYBODY STAYS.

21:50.467 --> 21:53.067
YOU'RE ANGRY, GEORGIE...

21:53.100 --> 21:56.733
AT CALLIE, AT YOUR BROTHERS,
AT DR. HAHN,

21:56.767 --> 21:59.600
AT DR. BAILEY, AT DR. YANG,
AT DR. BURKE.

21:59.633 --> 22:05.233
THAT'S A LONG LIST
OF PEOPLE TO BE ANGRY AT.

22:05.267 --> 22:08.700
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE PERSON
YOU'RE REALLY ANGRY AT...

22:08.733 --> 22:10.267
IS ME.

22:10.300 --> 22:12.467
DAD?

22:12.500 --> 22:15.233
I-I DRINK AND I SMOKE

22:15.267 --> 22:16.767
AND I DON'T EXERCISE

22:16.800 --> 22:18.700
AND I EAT
ALL THE WRONG THINGS,

22:18.733 --> 22:22.267
AND NOW I HAVE CANCER.

22:23.833 --> 22:25.733
AND YOU HAVE TO TAKE CARE
OF EVERYTHING.

22:25.767 --> 22:27.667
YOU HAVE TO TAKE CARE
OF ME.

22:27.700 --> 22:29.600
I DON'T MIND.

22:31.567 --> 22:34.200
YOU DO.

22:37.500 --> 22:40.067
YOU'RE MAD AT ME,

22:40.067 --> 22:43.100
AND THAT'S OKAY
BECAUSE I'M MAD AT ME, TOO.

22:43.133 --> 22:47.433
YOU THINK I WANT TO DIE
AND LEAVE MY BOY IN CHARGE?

22:49.100 --> 22:52.167
YOU ARE NOT GONNA DIE.

22:55.533 --> 22:57.333
(door opens)

22:57.367 --> 22:59.467
WHAT'S GOING ON?

22:59.500 --> 23:01.533
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE
IN HERE, GEORGIE.

23:01.567 --> 23:03.333
YEAH, YOU'RE GONNA GET
IN TROUBLE, GEORGIE.

23:03.367 --> 23:05.067
GEORGIE DOESN'T WORK HERE!

23:05.067 --> 23:07.800
IN THIS HOSPITAL,
MY NAME IS DR. O'MALLEY!

23:07.833 --> 23:09.633
DR. O'MALLEY...
(struggles for breath)
DAD.

23:09.667 --> 23:11.200
(monitor beeping erratically)
HONEY!

23:11.233 --> 23:12.533
DAD.

23:12.567 --> 23:15.200
GET DR. HAHN.

23:17.633 --> 23:20.167
I-I CAN'T...
DAD, DAD,
DON'T TRY TO TALK.

23:20.200 --> 23:22.133
(Louise) HE'S HAVING
A HEART ATTACK, GEORGIE!
WHY DON'T YOU PUMP HIS CHEST?

23:22.167 --> 23:24.533
GET THE PADDLES!
THEY ALWAYS USE THE PADDLES!
HE'S NOT HAVING
A HEART ATTACK.

23:24.567 --> 23:25.800
DAD. DAD, STOP!

23:25.833 --> 23:28.233
I'M TRYING TO HELP.
YOUR HEART'S GOING TOO FAST.

23:28.267 --> 23:30.567
RECYCLE HIS B.P.

23:30.600 --> 23:32.633
UH, PULL, UH, VERAPAMIL,
5 MILLIGRAMS.

23:32.667 --> 23:34.533
DAD. DAD!
STOP FIGHTING THE MASK.

23:34.567 --> 23:36.600
O'MALLEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
YOU SHOULD'VE PAGED HAHN.

23:36.633 --> 23:38.433
I PAGED ANYONE
FROM CARDIOTHORACICS.

23:38.467 --> 23:40.500
HE'S GOT A-FIB
WITH RAPID VENTRICLE RESPONSE.

23:40.533 --> 23:43.133
I'VE ORDERED VERAPAMIL.
HE'S IN V-TACH.

23:43.167 --> 23:46.600
THE VERAPAMIL IS GONNA CAUSE
MORE PROBLEMS THAN IT SOLVES.

23:46.633 --> 23:49.167
100 LIDOCAINE.
UH, PUT ON HIS 0-2 MASK.

23:49.200 --> 23:51.800
(monitor beeping erratically)

24:00.433 --> 24:02.600
(Erica) ALL RIGHT,
WHAT HAPPENED?

24:02.633 --> 24:06.500
HE WENT INTO V-TACH. O'MALLEY
IS GIVING HIM LIDOCAINE.

24:06.533 --> 24:08.667
IT'S ALREADY PUT HIM
BACK IN, UH, NORMAL SINUS.

24:08.700 --> 24:11.633
ALL RIGHT,
I NEED EVERYONE OUT OF HERE.

24:26.500 --> 24:28.833
I GOT YOUR PAGE.
I NEED ANOTHER CAPPUCCINO.

24:28.867 --> 24:31.300
DID YOU THINK
I WAS KIDDING BEFORE?

24:31.333 --> 24:33.400
I AM YOUR ATTENDING,

24:33.433 --> 24:35.433
AND IF YOU WANT IN
ON MY SURGERIES,

24:35.467 --> 24:38.467
YOU'RE GONNA LEARN
HOW TO FETCH AND STAY

24:38.500 --> 24:40.800
AND HEEL.

24:40.833 --> 24:42.100
(elevator bell dings)

24:42.133 --> 24:43.600
FINE.

24:43.633 --> 24:44.833
DON'T FETCH ANGRY.

24:44.867 --> 24:46.833
IF YOU THINK THIS MEANS
I RESPECT YOU,

24:46.867 --> 24:49.467
IF YOU WANT ME
TO RESPECT YOU,

24:49.500 --> 24:52.667
YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
WORTH RESPECTING.

24:52.700 --> 24:55.100
(Derek) ALL OF THESE CABLES
OF NERVES...

24:55.133 --> 24:56.600
AH...

24:56.633 --> 24:59.367
I CAN'T DO THIS SURGERY,
MIRANDA. IT'S--MNH-MNH.

25:02.167 --> 25:04.633
I STARTED TO THINK
I SHOULDN'T BE OPERATING

25:04.667 --> 25:06.167
AFTER THE DUQUETTE M&M.

25:06.200 --> 25:09.467
ALL THE WHISPERS
AND THE TALK...

25:09.500 --> 25:10.667
I LET THAT IN.

25:10.700 --> 25:11.633
MM.

25:11.667 --> 25:14.833
I STARTED
TO QUESTION MYSELF.

25:14.867 --> 25:16.767
I BELIEVED IT
WHEN I WAS TOLD, UH,

25:16.800 --> 25:19.700
I WAS NO LONGER OF USE
IN THE O.R.

25:19.733 --> 25:21.633
OH, SO WHEN YOU SAID
YOU WANTED JUSTICE,

25:21.667 --> 25:24.133
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT--
I'M A SURGEON.

25:24.167 --> 25:26.067
UH-HUH.
THERE ARE LIVES IN MY HANDS.

25:26.100 --> 25:28.633
TO MAKE ME QUESTION THAT...

25:28.667 --> 25:31.133
NO, THAT'S TO PUT
A LIFE AT STAKE

25:31.167 --> 25:34.367
EVERY TIME I HOLD A SCALPEL.

25:39.367 --> 25:41.267
WELL, I TOLD BURKE
I COULD FIX HIS HAND,

25:41.300 --> 25:42.633
AND THEN...

25:42.667 --> 25:44.167
WELL, YOU DID.
YEAH.

25:44.200 --> 25:45.533
HE IS NOT PARALYZED

25:45.567 --> 25:47.467
OR--OR DISABLED
IN ANY WAY.

25:47.500 --> 25:49.267
HE HAS A TREMOR.

25:49.300 --> 25:51.200
AND IF HE HAD BEEN HONEST
ABOUT THAT,

25:51.233 --> 25:53.200
WELL, THERE'S NO TELLING
WHAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE

25:53.233 --> 25:54.800
TO PREVENT IT.
MM-HMM.

25:54.833 --> 25:57.300
WE CAN DO THIS.

25:59.567 --> 26:01.467
HOLD ON TO MY WEDDING RING,
HONEY.

26:01.500 --> 26:03.767
HOSPITAL RULES.

26:03.800 --> 26:06.233
GEORGIE, ARE YOU GONNA
BE THERE IN THE OPERATION?

26:06.267 --> 26:08.600
THEY DON'T ALLOW FAMILY IN,
BUT YOU'LL BE FINE.

26:08.633 --> 26:10.100
I'LL BE FINE.

26:10.133 --> 26:12.433
WE'LL TAKE GOOD CARE
OF YOU.

26:16.733 --> 26:19.533
(Louise)
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

26:19.567 --> 26:23.267
(sobs) WHAT AM I GONNA DO
IF HE DIES?

26:28.267 --> 26:29.600
I CHANGED MY MIND.

26:29.633 --> 26:31.133
OH, NO, YOU DIDN'T.

26:31.167 --> 26:33.067
DR. BAILEY, I'D LIKE TO BE
EXCUSED FROM THE TWINS

26:33.100 --> 26:34.833
IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT
WITH YOU.

26:34.867 --> 26:36.767
I'D LIKE TO BE
WITH MY MOM.

26:36.800 --> 26:38.700
THAT'S THE RIGHT CALL,
O'MALLEY. GO.

26:38.733 --> 26:40.633
PROMISE ME SOMETHING--
WHEN YOU SEPARATE US,

26:40.667 --> 26:43.133
CAN YOU MAKE SURE HIS ASS
IS BIGGER THAN MINE?

26:43.167 --> 26:44.100
(chuckles)

26:44.133 --> 26:49.267
I CAN HEAR YOU.

26:49.300 --> 26:50.200
YOU'RE STILL HERE.

26:50.233 --> 26:51.767
I WENT TO N.I.C.U.
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE DONE.

26:51.800 --> 26:53.700
I'M HAVING TROUBLE
WITH THIS ANASTOMOSIS,

26:53.733 --> 26:56.067
AND I STILL HAVE TO TAKE
A LOOK AT THE DISTAL BOWEL.

26:56.100 --> 26:57.833
WHAT SHOULD I TELL MOLLY?
I DON'T KNOW.

26:57.867 --> 26:59.767
TELL HER I'M DOING
THE BEST I CAN.

26:59.800 --> 27:02.067
I DON'T KNOW.

27:04.533 --> 27:06.167
(Mark) DR. BAILEY,

27:06.200 --> 27:09.500
I'D LIKE MY INTERN TO OBSERVE
FROM A BETTER VANTAGE POINT.

27:09.533 --> 27:11.400
DR. STEVENS?

27:11.433 --> 27:13.567
YES.
SHE'S MY INTERN TODAY,

27:13.600 --> 27:16.100
AND I'D LIKE HER NEARBY
DURING SURGERY,

27:16.133 --> 27:18.767
NOT UP IN THE GALLERY,
IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU.
NO PROBLEM.

27:18.800 --> 27:21.800
DR. BAILEY, STEVENS IS
WITHOUT PRIVILEGES.

27:21.833 --> 27:23.500
OH, 'CAUSE SHE MESSED UP?

27:23.533 --> 27:28.500
DR. YANG MESSED UP, AND SHE'S
OVER IN O.R. TWO RIGHT NOW.

27:29.667 --> 27:31.567
WILL YOU HIT THAT FOR ME?

27:31.600 --> 27:34.467
STEVENS, I TAKE IT
YOU REMEMBER HOW TO SCRUB IN.

27:34.500 --> 27:36.400
COME ON.

27:38.400 --> 27:40.300
(Derek) THIS VESSEL'S
EVEN MORE FRAGILE

27:40.333 --> 27:42.233
THAN IN THE BIOMODEL.
(Richard) HMM.

27:42.267 --> 27:43.700
LET'S DO A MICROVASCULAR
BYPASS GRAFT.

27:43.733 --> 27:45.633
I COULD HARVEST THE SAPHENOUS
VEIN WHILE I'M DOWN HERE.

27:45.667 --> 27:48.500
I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

27:48.533 --> 27:50.333
GENTLEMEN, WE NEED
TO MAKE A DECISION,

27:50.367 --> 27:52.333
AND WE NEED TO MAKE IT NOW.

27:52.367 --> 27:55.767
DEREK, IT'S YOUR CALL.

27:55.800 --> 27:58.733
DO YOU OR DON'T YOU
WANT TO PROCEED?

28:06.633 --> 28:10.800
ALL RIGHT,
GIVE ME A 10-BLADE.

28:10.833 --> 28:14.067
(Richard) LET'S GET SOME
SUCTION IN HERE, PLEASE.

28:14.100 --> 28:15.633
THANK YOU.

28:21.667 --> 28:24.433
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.

28:24.467 --> 28:26.200
ME EITHER.

28:27.600 --> 28:28.067
HOW'S IT GOING?

28:28.067 --> 28:34.200
THEY JUST STARTED.

28:34.233 --> 28:36.267
(Erica) THE SKIN INCISION
IS DONE.

28:36.300 --> 28:39.833
LET'S GO.

28:39.867 --> 28:44.067
(saw whirring)

28:49.633 --> 28:53.500
SHE'S...
THROUGH THE STERNUM.

28:53.533 --> 28:55.400
THERE'S A BIT
OF BLEEDING.

28:55.433 --> 28:58.067
SHE'S STOPPING IT
WITH BONE WAX.

28:58.067 --> 29:00.800
INSERTING THE RETRACTOR...

29:00.833 --> 29:02.333
SHE'S OPENING

29:02.367 --> 29:05.267
THE PERICARDIAL SAC.

29:05.300 --> 29:07.233
TAKING A LOOK
AT THE ECHO,

29:07.267 --> 29:09.467
SHE'S NODDING.

29:09.500 --> 29:12.367
LOOKS GOOD.

29:12.400 --> 29:16.067
THEY'RE LOOKING AT
YOUR DAD'S HEART NOW.

29:16.067 --> 29:20.067
SHE'S PREPARING TO PUT IN
THE STAY SUTURES.

29:32.733 --> 29:35.233
IS THE SAPHENOUS VEIN
GRAFT IN PLACE?

29:35.267 --> 29:36.733
(Mark) YEAH.
YEAH, I'M READY.
DR. BAILEY?

29:36.767 --> 29:37.800
I'M GOOD.
CHIEF?

29:37.833 --> 29:39.533
READY WHEN YOU ARE.

29:39.567 --> 29:41.467
ALL RIGHT,
THE MOMENT OF TRUTH.

29:41.500 --> 29:44.700
REMOVING THE CLAMPS.

29:46.333 --> 29:48.433
CHECK THE NERVE STIMULATOR.

29:49.667 --> 29:51.300
S.S.E.P.s ARE FALLING.

29:51.333 --> 29:53.367
ALL RIGHT,
PUMP UP THE BLOOD PRESSURE.

29:53.400 --> 29:56.500
WE NEED AS MUCH BLOOD THROUGH
THE AREA AS POSSIBLE.

29:56.533 --> 29:58.333
(Miranda)
I'M GOING UP TO 2 MILLIAMPS.

29:58.367 --> 29:59.700
UP TO 3.

29:59.733 --> 30:02.267
(Richard) WAIT A MINUTE.
UH, I SEE SOMETHING.

30:02.300 --> 30:04.200
A FLICKER ON THE HAMSTRING
OF TWIN "A."

30:04.233 --> 30:06.533
(Mark) ANYTHING ON TWIN "B"?

30:06.567 --> 30:08.767
PUMP IT UP SOME MORE.
OKAY, UP TO 4.

30:08.800 --> 30:12.300
A TWITCH. I GOT A TWITCH
ON TWIN B's GASTROC.

30:12.333 --> 30:15.433
YEAH, IT'S SMALL,
BUT IT'S THERE.
WE HAVE A SIGNAL.

30:15.467 --> 30:17.167
CONGRATULATIONS,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

30:17.200 --> 30:19.833
WE HAVE FOUR FUNCTIONING LEGS.

30:19.867 --> 30:21.500
(applause)

30:21.533 --> 30:24.333
***

30:24.367 --> 30:27.500
(Richard) GOOD JOB,
EVERYBODY.

30:27.533 --> 30:30.800
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
ON THREE.

30:30.833 --> 30:34.067
ONE...

30:34.100 --> 30:37.233
TWO...

30:37.267 --> 30:39.233
THREE.

30:39.267 --> 30:42.267
***

30:47.233 --> 30:49.367
IT'D BE NICE
IF EVERY LOVE TRIANGLE

30:49.400 --> 30:51.300
COULD BE FIXED WITH A SCALPEL.

30:51.333 --> 30:53.500
IF THEY COULD, YOU'D HAVE
STABBED ME WITH A 10-BLADE

30:53.533 --> 30:55.600
A LONG TIME AGO. (laughs)
(laughs)

30:55.633 --> 30:58.633
***

31:00.433 --> 31:02.367
BYE. HOW IS SHE?

31:02.400 --> 31:04.133
PLEASE TELL ME GOOD NEWS

31:04.167 --> 31:06.067
BECAUSE I HAVE TO GO IN
AND TELL MOLLY,

31:06.100 --> 31:08.400
AND I DON'T WANT TO TELL HER
ANYTHING BAD.

31:08.433 --> 31:11.300
DR. MONTGOMERY IS ON HER WAY,
AND SHE WILL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.

31:11.333 --> 31:13.067
BUT THE BABY--
LAURA.

31:13.100 --> 31:14.600
MOLLY NAMED HER LAURA.

31:14.633 --> 31:16.533
OH, LAURA--WILL NEED
SOME RECOVERY TIME,

31:16.567 --> 31:19.100
BUT SHE SHOULD BE
JUST FINE.

31:19.133 --> 31:21.500
OH, THANK YOU.

31:21.533 --> 31:23.700
OH, I WAS SO SCARED.
(laughs)

31:23.733 --> 31:25.667
OH, THANK YOU. OH, GOD.

31:25.700 --> 31:28.667
SHE'S GONNA BE SO HAPPY
TO HEAR THIS.

31:28.700 --> 31:31.067
HEY, THIS IS YOUR NIECE,
YOU KNOW?

31:31.067 --> 31:32.800
(sighs)

31:32.833 --> 31:34.633
I'M SORRY.

31:34.667 --> 31:36.067
YOU'RE VERY NICE.

31:36.067 --> 31:39.500
YOU BOTH SEEM...
SO NICE.

31:39.533 --> 31:42.167
***

31:42.200 --> 31:45.600
BUT I DON'T KNOW YOU.

31:45.633 --> 31:48.767
AND YOU ARE NOT MY FAMILY.

31:48.800 --> 31:51.800
***

31:57.467 --> 31:59.733
***

31:59.767 --> 32:02.100
I'M CLOSING THE AORTOTOMY.
WHAT'S NEXT?

32:02.133 --> 32:04.067
PLACE THE NEEDLE
IN THE ASCENDING AORTA

32:04.067 --> 32:07.533
TO REMOVE AIR AND THEN RELEASE
THE AORTIC VALVE CLAMP.

32:07.567 --> 32:10.767
YOU REMIND ME OF MYSELF
WHEN I WAS AN INTERN.

32:10.800 --> 32:12.367
I DO?

32:12.400 --> 32:14.533
FOCUSED, INTENSE...

32:14.567 --> 32:17.067
COLD--AND I DON'T MEAN THAT
AS A BAD THING.

32:17.100 --> 32:18.367
COLD IS GOOD.

32:18.400 --> 32:20.167
THE DATING, THE FRIENDS,
THE FAMILY--

32:20.200 --> 32:22.267
IF YOU ASK ME,
IT'S ALL OVERRATED.

32:22.300 --> 32:26.600
(Erica)
ALL RIGHT, TUBES ARE OUT.

32:26.633 --> 32:29.067
OH, THE ASCENDING AORTA
IS LOOKING DILATED.

32:29.067 --> 32:31.733
(Erica)
THERE'S TOO MUCH BLEEDING

32:31.767 --> 32:33.800
AROUND THE AORTIC SUTURE LINE.
B.P. IS 68 OVER 42.

32:33.833 --> 32:36.267
GOD...

32:36.300 --> 32:38.733
(woman) HE'S BRADYING DOWN.

32:38.767 --> 32:41.367
GET ME ANOTHER T.E.E.
AND AN ECHOCARDIOGRAM, STAT.

32:41.400 --> 32:44.300
LET'S MOVE IT, PEOPLE.
THIS DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

32:51.867 --> 32:54.533
WE GOTTA GET CONTROL
OF THIS BLEEDING.

32:54.567 --> 32:56.467
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET HIM
BACK ON BYPASS.

32:56.500 --> 32:59.267
I COULD PUT THE AORTIC CANNULA
INTO HIS RIGHT ATRIUM.
BY YOURSELF?

32:59.300 --> 33:01.100
YES.

33:01.133 --> 33:03.300
ALL RIGHT, DO IT.

33:05.400 --> 33:08.267
REPLACE IT WITH A 2-STAGE
VENOUS CANNULA.

33:10.167 --> 33:11.533
WHY IS SHE DOING THAT?

33:11.567 --> 33:13.467
WH-WHY IS HAHN
LETTING HER DO THAT?

33:13.500 --> 33:15.500
NO, IT'S OKAY. SHE'S DOING
A RUNNING WHIP STITCH.

33:15.533 --> 33:18.367
SHE'S DONE IT BEFORE.

33:24.133 --> 33:25.333
(monitor beeping rhythmically

33:25.367 --> 33:28.300
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL WORK,
DR. YANG.

33:32.067 --> 33:35.067
DR. HAHN'S WORK
WAS IMPECCABLE, O'MALLEY.

33:35.067 --> 33:37.600
I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE
ANYTHING DIFFERENT MYSELF.

33:37.633 --> 33:39.600
IT'S JUST, UH...

33:39.633 --> 33:40.833
YOU CAN NEVER TELL

33:40.867 --> 33:43.767
HOW THE BODY
IS GOING TO RESPOND.

33:45.300 --> 33:47.633
EVERY SURGERY...

33:47.667 --> 33:51.400
EVERY BODY IS DIFFERENT.

33:51.433 --> 33:54.100
YOU JUST...

33:54.133 --> 33:56.167
NEVER KNOW.

33:58.633 --> 34:00.667
BUT IT'S OKAY NOW.

34:00.700 --> 34:02.667
THEY'RE IN THE HOME STRETCH.

34:06.433 --> 34:08.800
THANK YOU, DR. BURKE.

34:15.800 --> 34:17.767
(Miranda)
IT UNDERMINES EVERYTHING

34:17.800 --> 34:20.267
FOR MY INTERNS TO SEE YANG

34:20.300 --> 34:21.800
GO WITHOUT PUNISHMENT,

34:21.833 --> 34:25.800
FOR ME TO SEE BURKE
GO WITHOUT PUNISHMENT.

34:25.833 --> 34:27.467
TAKE A STEP BACK.

34:27.500 --> 34:30.067
TRY AND GET
SOME PERSPECTIVE.

34:30.067 --> 34:31.667
SO THERE WILL BE
NO CONSEQUENCES,

34:31.700 --> 34:33.367
FOR EITHER OF THEM.

34:33.400 --> 34:36.233
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO,
FIRE THE BOTH OF THEM,

34:36.267 --> 34:38.167
END THEIR CAREERS?

34:38.200 --> 34:40.100
THEY MADE
A TERRIBLE JUDGMENT CALL.

34:40.133 --> 34:41.800
WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENED
WITH DENNY DUQUETTE.

34:41.833 --> 34:44.167
AND THEY DIDN'T KILL
ANYBODY.

34:44.200 --> 34:46.133
AND I DID.
YOU DIDN'T KILL DUQUETTE,

34:46.167 --> 34:48.100
AND I WON'T HAVE YOU
SAYING YOU DID.

34:48.133 --> 34:50.167
I WAS RESPONSIBLE
FOR IZZIE STEVENS.

34:50.200 --> 34:52.567
I WAS RESPONSIBLE.

34:52.600 --> 34:54.500
AND I'M RESPONSIBLE
FOR CRISTINA YANG.

34:54.533 --> 34:57.767
I...
AM THE COMMON THREAD HERE.

34:57.800 --> 35:01.200
I... LOST THEM.

35:01.233 --> 35:03.367
CRISTINA, IZZIE--

35:03.400 --> 35:06.100
ARE NOT THE SAME.

35:06.133 --> 35:08.200
MIRANDA...

35:08.233 --> 35:10.667
YOU RAISE THEM...

35:10.700 --> 35:12.567
YOU RAISE THEM LIKE...

35:12.600 --> 35:14.800
LIKE CHILDREN...

35:14.833 --> 35:16.733
AND SOME OF THEM
MAKE MISTAKES

35:16.767 --> 35:18.667
AND SOME OF THEM
DISAPPOINT YOU.

35:18.700 --> 35:20.433
SOME OF THEM...

35:22.133 --> 35:25.067
DO YOU KNOW WHAT KIND
OF STRENGTH

35:25.100 --> 35:27.800
IT MUST HAVE TAKEN YANG
TO COME TO ME,

35:27.833 --> 35:33.300
TO REPORT ON AN ATTENDING,
ON HER BOYFRIEND?

35:33.333 --> 35:36.633
DO YOU SEE
HOW MUCH SHE'S GROWN?

35:38.633 --> 35:41.067
YOU RAISE THEM...

35:41.067 --> 35:43.467
LIKE CHILDREN...

35:45.433 --> 35:48.633
AND SOME OF THEM TURN OUT
EXACTLY LIKE YOU, DR. BAILEY.

35:48.667 --> 35:51.667
***

35:53.800 --> 35:56.633
WE'RE FINALLY ALONE.

35:56.667 --> 35:59.300
(chuckles) YEAH.

35:59.333 --> 36:01.233
PETE?

36:06.633 --> 36:09.733
IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY.

36:09.767 --> 36:13.100
OKAY.

36:13.133 --> 36:14.333
ALL RIGHT.

36:14.367 --> 36:17.067
WELL, YOU GET
A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP,

36:17.100 --> 36:22.733
AND, UH, I'LL, UM,
COME BACK IN THE MORNING.

36:22.767 --> 36:25.167
***

36:25.200 --> 36:27.467
(Meredith) AT THE END
OF THE DAY,

36:27.500 --> 36:29.433
WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT,

36:29.467 --> 36:34.733
ALL WE REALLY WANT
IS TO BE CLOSE TO SOMEBODY...

36:34.767 --> 36:38.433
***

36:38.467 --> 36:40.833
COULDN'T STAY AWAY?

36:40.867 --> 36:44.067
***

36:59.233 --> 37:01.500
SO THIS THING WHERE WE ALL
KEEP OUR DISTANCE

37:01.533 --> 37:03.433
AND PRETEND NOT TO CARE
ABOUT EACH OTHER--

37:03.467 --> 37:07.533
IT'S USUALLY A LOT OF BULL.

37:10.567 --> 37:12.733
DID YOU WANT TO COME IN?

37:12.767 --> 37:15.600
NO. UH, I JUST, UH...

37:15.633 --> 37:16.767
SHE'S OKAY?

37:16.800 --> 37:19.300
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

37:19.333 --> 37:20.367
GOOD.

37:20.400 --> 37:23.100
***

37:23.133 --> 37:26.333
WE COULD BE YOUR FAMILY
IF YOU WANT US.

37:26.367 --> 37:28.267
YOU HAVE A MOTHER, I KNOW.

37:28.300 --> 37:29.767
I'M NOT SAYING...

37:29.800 --> 37:33.467
I'M JUST SAYING THAT
WE COULD BE YOUR FAMILY, TOO.

37:37.267 --> 37:43.733
SO WE PICK AND CHOOSE
WHO WE WANT TO REMAIN CLOSE TO.

37:43.767 --> 37:46.767
***

37:50.167 --> 37:52.767
I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE.

37:52.800 --> 37:54.700
(Izzie) WHAT?
LET HER OFF THE HOOK.

37:54.733 --> 37:57.167
LET CRISTINA OFF
THE FREAKIN' HOOK.
MEREDITH...

37:57.200 --> 37:59.567
IZZIE,
YOU CUT THE LVAD WIRE.

37:59.600 --> 38:01.067
SHE STUCK BY YOU
AND DID DENNY'S ECHO.

38:01.100 --> 38:02.600
YOU CHEATED ON IZZIE
WITH SYPH NURSE,

38:02.633 --> 38:05.367
AND SHE HELPED YOU STUDY
FOR YOUR BOARDS.

38:05.400 --> 38:07.300
AND, GEORGE, WHEN EVERYBODY
WAS CALLING YOU 007--

38:07.333 --> 38:09.233
SHE WAS CALLING ME 007.

38:09.267 --> 38:12.667
***

38:17.467 --> 38:21.200
JUST LET HER OFF THE HOOK.

38:21.233 --> 38:25.067
***

38:26.867 --> 38:28.667
IT'S OKAY.

38:30.833 --> 38:32.567
SORRY.

38:34.233 --> 38:37.400
***

38:39.400 --> 38:41.300
WHY CAN'T YOU MIND
YOUR OWN BUSINESS?

38:41.333 --> 38:43.767
YOU KNOW,
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

38:43.800 --> 38:45.700
YOU'RE MY SISTER.
YOU'RE MY FAMILY.

38:45.733 --> 38:48.467
YOU'RE ALL I'VE GOT.

38:48.500 --> 38:52.433
AND ONCE WE'VE CHOSEN
THOSE PEOPLE...

38:52.467 --> 38:55.700
I'M SO TIRED.

38:55.733 --> 38:57.400
I KNOW. ME, TOO.

38:57.433 --> 39:00.100
WE TEND TO STICK CLOSE BY...

39:00.133 --> 39:03.833
***

39:03.867 --> 39:04.967
UH, I WAS--I JUST--

39:05.067 --> 39:07.667
I WANTED TO CHECK ON YOUR DAD
AND SEE HOW HE WAS DOING.

39:07.700 --> 39:10.067
GOOD. HE'S RESTING,
BUT HE'S GOOD.

39:11.633 --> 39:14.133
OKAY.

39:14.167 --> 39:16.367
OKAY.

39:16.400 --> 39:18.333
***

39:18.367 --> 39:21.167
NO MATTER HOW MUCH
WE HURT THEM.

39:21.200 --> 39:23.400
(elevator bell dings)

39:23.433 --> 39:25.133
HEY.

39:25.167 --> 39:26.567
(Derek) HI THERE.

39:26.600 --> 39:29.300
I'M GONNA GO BACK UPSTAIRS
WITH DR. BURKE.

39:29.333 --> 39:31.833
HE WANTS ME TO TAKE
A LOOK AT HIS SHOULDER.

39:31.867 --> 39:34.733
I'M GONNA BE A WHILE.
DON'T WAIT UP, OKAY?
OKAY.

39:34.767 --> 39:37.500
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE
STILL WITH YOU

39:37.533 --> 39:41.100
AT THE END OF THE DAY...

39:41.133 --> 39:45.367
THOSE ARE THE ONES
WORTH KEEPING.

39:45.400 --> 39:49.600
AND SURE, SOMETIMES CLOSE
CAN BE TOO CLOSE...

39:49.633 --> 39:51.467
I COULDN'T STAY
WITH THAT MAN.

39:51.500 --> 39:55.067
I DON'T CARE THAT HE--
THAT HE'S MEREDITH'S FATHER,

39:55.067 --> 39:58.067
I-I JUST COULDN'T TAKE IT,
AND THEN RICHARD--AND HE--

39:58.067 --> 40:01.067
AND HE... (sobbing)

40:05.467 --> 40:07.767
NO... (gasps)

40:18.133 --> 40:21.133
MEREDITH.

40:22.767 --> 40:25.200
MOMMY?

40:32.600 --> 40:36.233
BUT SOMETIMES THAT INVASION
OF PERSONAL SPACE...

40:36.267 --> 40:38.400
(sobs)

40:38.433 --> 40:42.633
IT CAN BE EXACTLY
WHAT YOU NEED.
