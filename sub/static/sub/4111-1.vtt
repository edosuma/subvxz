00:53.160 --> 00:57.700
NEW MOON

00:57.830 --> 01:00.500
"These violent delights have violent ends."

01:01.960 --> 01:03.960
"And in their triumph die,

01:04.290 --> 01:05.920
like fire and powder."

01:06.920 --> 01:10.510
"Which, as they kiss, consume."

01:45.170 --> 01:46.340
Gran?

02:03.020 --> 02:04.940
Edward, don't, she'll see you.

02:16.280 --> 02:17.120
Okay.

02:27.590 --> 02:29.590
Gran, I'd like you to meet...

02:59.740 --> 03:01.080
Happy birthday, Bella.

03:14.010 --> 03:15.970
Happy birthday.

03:20.560 --> 03:21.970
I thought we agreed, no presents.

03:22.220 --> 03:25.850
The one from me's not wrapped.
So it doesn't count.

03:29.980 --> 03:31.980
That's actually great. Thanks, Dad.

03:32.110 --> 03:36.660
It goes with this one from your mom.
We coordinated.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.660
Well, she coordinated me.

03:40.910 --> 03:44.620
It's to put your pictures in
from senior year.

03:46.920 --> 03:48.040
Senior year.

03:48.830 --> 03:50.090
How'd you get so old so fast?

03:50.340 --> 03:52.840
I didn't. It's not that old.

03:52.920 --> 03:55.130
I don't know. Is that a gray hair?

03:56.050 --> 03:58.220
No. No way.

04:01.560 --> 04:02.720
Happy birthday.

04:03.140 --> 04:04.310
That's really funny.

04:05.890 --> 04:08.980
Another missing hiker brings the total to
three presumed dead.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.360
Rangers are searching for
the killer animal.

04:20.120 --> 04:24.040
It's Bella. Bella! Hi!

04:26.120 --> 04:27.960
Today's the big day, Bella.

04:29.120 --> 04:30.880
R and J essay due.

04:31.130 --> 04:31.960
Oh yeah.

04:32.040 --> 04:35.010
Wherefore art thou, Bella?

04:35.670 --> 04:37.720
Let me take a picture of you guys.
My mom...

04:38.050 --> 04:40.970
wants me to put together
a scrapbook full of memories.

04:41.050 --> 04:43.100
- Cool. Yeah.
- I take 'em. I'm not in 'em.

04:43.310 --> 04:45.970
No, come here. - You'll photoshop
this if my nose looks big, right?

04:46.180 --> 04:49.060
Don't worry, I'm in the picture.
No one will be looking at you guys.

04:50.150 --> 04:51.100
That's good.

04:52.060 --> 04:54.360
Oh, good. Cullen's here.

04:54.730 --> 04:55.940
Yay.

04:57.570 --> 04:58.740
Talk to you later.

05:22.050 --> 05:24.300
- Happy birthday.
- Don't remind me.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.890
Bell, your birth is definitely something
to celebrate.

05:29.140 --> 05:31.020
Yeah, but my aging's not.

05:31.270 --> 05:32.310
Your aging?

05:34.310 --> 05:37.190
I think 18 is a little young to start
worrying about that.

05:37.320 --> 05:38.740
It's one year older than you.

05:39.070 --> 05:41.660
No, it isn't. I'm 109.

05:42.860 --> 05:46.120
Maybe I shouldn't be dating
such an old man. It's gross.

05:46.410 --> 05:48.700
I should be thoroughly repulsed.

06:00.300 --> 06:01.800
We have to go to class.

06:02.130 --> 06:03.180
Okay.

06:07.720 --> 06:08.720
Wait a second.

06:10.140 --> 06:11.230
Someone wants you.

06:12.270 --> 06:13.560
Bella!

06:13.850 --> 06:15.230
Jacob!

06:17.980 --> 06:19.150
I'll leave you to talk.

06:24.320 --> 06:28.660
Hello, Biceps! You know,
anabolic steroids are really bad for you.

06:29.200 --> 06:31.200
I'm just filling out, Bella.

06:31.450 --> 06:34.710
It wouldn't seem so drastic if
we hung out more.

06:35.290 --> 06:38.210
You should switch schools.
You can come hang out with the palefaces.

06:38.420 --> 06:39.250
I'm all right.

06:39.590 --> 06:41.800
I prefer the rez school's exclusivity.

06:42.420 --> 06:44.840
They let any old riff-raff into this place.

06:45.090 --> 06:47.180
I see. Then why are you slumming it'?

06:47.180 --> 06:49.600
I was just buying a part for the Rabbit.

06:49.890 --> 06:52.230
You should really come take a ride
when it's done.

06:52.480 --> 06:53.480
Is it fast?

06:55.440 --> 06:57.110
It's decent.

06:58.110 --> 07:00.900
- You're kidding.
- Okay. Good.

07:01.150 --> 07:03.320
Hey, happy birthday.

07:04.650 --> 07:06.910
Your dad told my dad, so...

07:07.280 --> 07:08.950
Yeah, of course, he did.

07:09.870 --> 07:13.250
I saw this the other day and
thought of you.

07:14.330 --> 07:16.000
Catches bad dreams.

07:17.880 --> 07:20.000
That's kinda perfect.

07:22.130 --> 07:23.260
Thank you.

07:23.970 --> 07:25.180
No problem.

07:27.760 --> 07:29.350
- Good seeing you.
- Yeah, I'll see you later.

07:31.430 --> 07:34.430
So how come Jacob Black gets
to give you a gift and I don't?

07:36.230 --> 07:38.230
Cause I have nothing
to give back to you.

07:39.900 --> 07:42.230
Bella, you give me everything
just by breathing.

07:44.820 --> 07:47.740
Gee? Thank you. That's all I want

07:47.950 --> 07:48.740
Bella!

07:50.410 --> 07:51.990
Happy birthday!

07:55.410 --> 07:56.750
I thought I said no presents?

07:57.080 --> 07:58.880
I've already seen you open it
and guess what?

07:59.130 --> 08:00.170
You love it.

08:00.500 --> 08:03.000
You're gonna wear it tonight. Our place.

08:05.050 --> 08:06.720
Come on. Please?

08:07.010 --> 08:08.300
It'll be fun.

08:11.550 --> 08:14.140
- Okay. All right.
- Great!

08:14.350 --> 08:15.730
I'll see you at seven.

08:18.310 --> 08:22.230
Jasper! No fair with
the mood control thing.

08:22.860 --> 08:25.780
Sorry, Bella. Happy...

08:26.860 --> 08:27.820
Never mind.

08:30.450 --> 08:33.870
You can't trust vampires. Trust me.

08:34.870 --> 08:37.370
"Oh my love. My wife."

08:37.460 --> 08:39.919
"Death, that hath sucked the honey of
thy breath..."

08:40.330 --> 08:42.419
"but hath no power yet upon thy beauty."

08:43.210 --> 08:45.300
"Thou art not conquered."

08:46.590 --> 08:48.720
"Beauty's ensign yet is crimson in

08:49.050 --> 08:51.390
thy lips and in thy cheeks."

08:51.680 --> 08:54.260
"Death's pale flag is not advanced there."

08:54.600 --> 08:56.770
I hate being celebrated.

08:57.230 --> 09:00.100
There are worse tragedies.
Look at Romeo.

09:00.350 --> 09:03.610
Killed his true love out
of sheer stupidity.

09:04.940 --> 09:08.610
But I do envy him one thing.

09:10.660 --> 09:12.530
Juliet. That's perfect.

09:12.820 --> 09:15.490
If you like that obviously beautiful
sort of thing.

09:19.160 --> 09:22.540
Not the girl. The suicide.

09:26.130 --> 09:29.090
It's nearly impossible for...

09:29.840 --> 09:33.550
for some... people.

09:35.100 --> 09:39.430
For humans, a little poison...

09:40.350 --> 09:42.350
a dagger to the heart.

09:43.650 --> 09:45.440
There're so many different options.

09:49.610 --> 09:50.820
Why would you say that?

09:52.780 --> 09:54.820
'Cause I had to consider it once.

09:57.540 --> 09:59.540
I didn't know if I'd get to you in time.

10:00.160 --> 10:03.710
I had to come up with some kind of plan.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.290
What was the plan?

10:06.710 --> 10:10.380
That I'd go to Italy and
provoke the Volturi.

10:10.550 --> 10:11.630
The what?

10:12.180 --> 10:13.010
The Volturi.

10:13.300 --> 10:16.800
Now, who'd like to repeat
the last few lines of iambic pentameter...

10:17.310 --> 10:19.060
just to show they were paying attention?

10:19.350 --> 10:20.680
Mr. Cullen?

10:23.770 --> 10:25.560
Yes, Mr. Berty.

10:28.360 --> 10:29.480
"O here..."

10:30.490 --> 10:32.950
"will I set up my everlasting rest..."

10:34.110 --> 10:38.540
"and shake the yoke of inauspicious
stars from this world-wearied flesh."

10:39.290 --> 10:41.500
"Eyes, look your last."

10:41.580 --> 10:44.040
"Arms, take your last embrace."

10:44.920 --> 10:48.590
"And lips, O you the doors of breath..."

10:48.590 --> 10:50.340
"seal with a righteous kiss

10:50.420 --> 10:53.170
a dateless bargain to engrossing death."

10:54.970 --> 10:56.680
Eyes on the screen, people.

10:59.260 --> 11:02.350
"Thus, with a kiss, I die."

11:04.440 --> 11:08.270
The Volturi are a very old
very powerful family.

11:08.520 --> 11:10.900
I guess they're the closest thing
to royalty my world has.

11:12.570 --> 11:14.070
Is that Carlisle?

11:14.280 --> 11:18.070
Yeah. He lived with them
for a few decades.

11:18.320 --> 11:20.450
Described 'em as very refined.

11:20.950 --> 11:23.500
No respect for human life, of course.

11:23.870 --> 11:27.330
But a respect for the arts and
the sciences, at least.

11:28.840 --> 11:30.210
And the law.

11:31.460 --> 11:33.010
Above all, the law.

11:36.430 --> 11:38.300
Vampires have laws?

11:39.640 --> 11:41.350
Not very many.

11:42.350 --> 11:45.640
And only one that's regularly enforced.

11:47.600 --> 11:48.980
What is it?

11:50.440 --> 11:53.480
That we keep the existence of
our kind a secret.

11:53.740 --> 11:57.700
We don't make spectacles of ourselves.

11:58.660 --> 12:02.120
And we don't kill conspicuously.

12:05.370 --> 12:07.620
Unless, of course, you want to die.

12:22.260 --> 12:23.930
You gotta stop talking about that.

12:24.310 --> 12:28.810
I can't even think about
someone hurting you.

12:30.610 --> 12:31.730
Bella...

12:32.730 --> 12:35.610
the only thing that can hurt me is you.

12:36.990 --> 12:39.200
And I don't have anything else
to be afraid of.

12:39.530 --> 12:40.620
That's not true.

12:43.410 --> 12:44.160
Victoria?

12:44.490 --> 12:46.160
She'll come for me one day.

12:46.700 --> 12:48.580
Alice will see when she decides...

12:48.670 --> 12:51.630
and we'll be ready.

12:51.710 --> 12:53.290
I could protect you...

12:54.550 --> 12:55.960
if you change me.

12:56.800 --> 13:00.010
Bella, you already do protect me.

13:01.180 --> 13:03.640
You're my only reason...

13:04.850 --> 13:09.560
to stay alive. If that's what I am.

13:11.400 --> 13:14.110
But it's my job to protect you.

13:17.490 --> 13:20.700
From everyone except my sister.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.700
It's time! It's time!

13:34.790 --> 13:36.420
Sorry about all this.

13:36.630 --> 13:39.670
- We tried to rein Alice in.
- As if that were even possible.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.390
- Happy birthday, Bella.
- Thanks.

13:44.680 --> 13:48.430
I found it in your bag. You mind?

13:48.730 --> 13:50.730
Dating an older woman. Hot.

13:52.770 --> 13:53.860
What?

13:54.150 --> 13:55.730
You first, Rosalie.

13:58.110 --> 13:59.440
It's a necklace.

13:59.940 --> 14:02.610
- Alice picked it out.
- Thanks.

14:05.780 --> 14:07.240
Show me the love.

14:11.040 --> 14:12.830
This one's from Emmett.

14:15.460 --> 14:17.590
Already installed it in your truck.

14:17.800 --> 14:19.920
Finally a decent sound system for
that piece of.

14:20.300 --> 14:22.260
Hey! Don't hate the truck.

14:23.010 --> 14:25.010
Open Esme and Carlisle's.

14:26.760 --> 14:28.970
Just a little something
to brighten your day.

14:29.220 --> 14:31.730
Yes, you've been looking kind of
pale lately.

14:39.940 --> 14:40.940
Paper cut.

15:06.090 --> 15:08.220
Jaz! Ssh! It's okay.

15:08.510 --> 15:09.890
It's just a little...

15:11.640 --> 15:12.850
blood.

15:19.690 --> 15:21.280
Get Jasper out of here.

15:27.240 --> 15:29.530
I'm sorry, I can't.

15:31.740 --> 15:34.290
I'll have to stitch this up in my office.

15:36.920 --> 15:37.880
Check on Jasper.

15:39.130 --> 15:40.750
I'm sure he's very upset with himself...

15:40.880 --> 15:43.510
and I doubt he'll listen to anyone
but you right now.

15:44.170 --> 15:45.760
Edward.

15:56.890 --> 15:59.060
I never wanted to have a party.

15:59.520 --> 16:00.690
It's not your fault.

16:02.480 --> 16:06.150
Jasper hasn't been away from
human blood as long as the rest of us.

16:07.450 --> 16:08.950
How do you do it?

16:09.910 --> 16:12.370
Years and years of practice.

16:12.910 --> 16:17.250
Did you ever think of just doing it
the easy way?

16:18.330 --> 16:19.460
No.

16:20.590 --> 16:24.880
I knew who I wanted to be.
I wanted to help people.

16:25.130 --> 16:28.970
Brings me happiness.
Even if I am damned regardless.

16:31.100 --> 16:32.350
Damned?

16:33.390 --> 16:36.520
Like hell?

16:42.610 --> 16:45.030
Carlisle, you couldn't be damned.

16:45.440 --> 16:47.820
You couldn't. It's impossible.

16:48.110 --> 16:49.950
Thank you, Bella.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.870
You've always been very

16:52.780 --> 16:54.950
gracious about us.

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
So that's it? That's why
he won't change me?

17:04.380 --> 17:07.170
Imagine the situation in reverse.

17:08.930 --> 17:11.339
If you believed as Edward does...

17:12.599 --> 17:14.930
could you take away his soul?

17:38.120 --> 17:40.500
You can't protect me.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.790
From everything.

17:44.170 --> 17:46.960
At some point, something's going to
separate us.

17:49.010 --> 17:50.720
It's gonna be an accident...

17:50.970 --> 17:52.390
or illness...

17:52.840 --> 17:54.850
or old age.

17:55.930 --> 17:57.890
As long as I'm human.

17:58.770 --> 18:01.190
And the only solution is to change me.

18:02.770 --> 18:04.150
That's not a solution.

18:04.440 --> 18:05.520
It's a tragedy.

18:05.820 --> 18:08.320
You're not gonna want me when
I look like a grandmother.

18:18.040 --> 18:19.410
Bella...

18:20.040 --> 18:23.370
do you not understand my feelings for
you at all?

18:25.460 --> 18:27.250
Carlisle told me...

18:30.260 --> 18:32.300
how you feel about your soul.

18:33.840 --> 18:35.930
I don't believe that.

18:36.930 --> 18:38.970
So don't worry about mine.

18:40.270 --> 18:42.020
You should go inside.

18:56.870 --> 18:58.990
It's still my birthday.

19:02.370 --> 19:04.370
So can I ask one thing?

19:07.880 --> 19:09.750
Kiss me?

19:40.660 --> 19:42.160
I love you.

19:44.750 --> 19:46.120
I love you.

21:08.120 --> 21:09.120
He)'

21:13.210 --> 21:14.960
Come take a walk with me.

21:39.150 --> 21:41.030
We have to leave Forks.

21:44.450 --> 21:45.660
Why?

21:49.210 --> 21:52.370
Carlisle's supposed to be
10 years older than he looks.

21:52.920 --> 21:54.750
And people are starting to notice.

21:57.710 --> 21:59.380
Qkay...

22:00.300 --> 22:02.930
I've got to think of something to say
to Charlie.

22:13.690 --> 22:15.270
When you say "we"...?

22:19.860 --> 22:21.990
I mean my family and myself.

22:26.240 --> 22:30.290
Edward, what happened with Jasper,
it's nothing.

22:30.370 --> 22:31.460
You're right.

22:32.160 --> 22:33.370
It was nothing.

22:35.250 --> 22:37.960
Nothing but what I always expected.

22:40.050 --> 22:43.010
And nothing compared to
what could have happened.

22:49.140 --> 22:52.140
You just don't belong in my world, Bella.

22:57.310 --> 22:59.070
I belong with you.

23:00.570 --> 23:03.650
No. You don't.

23:05.360 --> 23:07.070
I'm coming.

23:07.950 --> 23:09.240
Bella...

23:10.540 --> 23:13.370
I don't want you to come.

23:20.380 --> 23:22.590
You don't want me?

23:27.970 --> 23:29.220
No.

23:32.980 --> 23:34.810
That changes things.

23:35.560 --> 23:37.190
A lot.

23:37.730 --> 23:40.190
But if it's not too much to ask...

23:41.980 --> 23:44.190
can you just promise me something?

23:46.740 --> 23:48.780
Don't do anything reckless.

23:51.740 --> 23:53.450
For Charlie's sake.

23:54.870 --> 23:57.710
And I'll promise something to you
in return.

23:58.080 --> 24:00.920
This is the last time you'll ever see me.

24:01.380 --> 24:03.340
I won't come back.

24:03.340 --> 24:07.180
And you can go on with your life
without any interference from me.

24:08.140 --> 24:09.970
It Will be like...

24:10.300 --> 24:12.850
I never existed, I promise.

24:15.350 --> 24:19.400
If this is about my soul, take it.
I don't want it without you.

24:19.520 --> 24:21.360
It's not about your soul.

24:24.440 --> 24:27.240
You're just not good for me.

24:28.320 --> 24:30.450
Not good enough for you.

24:31.580 --> 24:34.330
I'm just sorry I let
this go on for so long.

24:36.080 --> 24:37.790
Please...

24:39.000 --> 24:40.460
Don't...

24:45.380 --> 24:46.720
Good bye.

25:16.540 --> 25:17.450
Edward.

25:21.960 --> 25:22.960
Edward!

25:26.460 --> 25:27.380
Edward.

27:32.510 --> 27:34.420
I'm gonna try the Cullens' place again.

27:35.720 --> 27:37.470
The Cullens left town, Charlie.

27:37.550 --> 27:38.720
Good riddance.

27:39.100 --> 27:40.310
Where'd they go?

27:41.560 --> 27:43.600
We'll find her.

27:43.730 --> 27:44.850
Thanks, Harry

27:45.390 --> 27:46.440
Charlie!

27:50.480 --> 27:51.980
She's all right.

27:53.070 --> 27:54.360
I got her.

27:55.700 --> 27:56.780
Thank you, Sam.

28:23.470 --> 28:27.520
OCTOBER

28:51.630 --> 28:56.130
NOVEMBER

29:06.430 --> 29:07.810
Alice...

29:08.850 --> 29:10.600
You have disappeared.

29:12.520 --> 29:14.150
Like everything else.

29:15.610 --> 29:18.610
Now who else can I talk to? I'm lost.

29:20.780 --> 29:25.370
DECEMBER

29:25.660 --> 29:31.120
When you left... And he left...

29:32.920 --> 29:35.090
you took everything with you.

29:37.420 --> 29:40.180
But the absence of him is everywhere
I look.

29:47.720 --> 29:51.600
It's like a huge hole has been punched
through my chest.

29:56.900 --> 29:58.280
Bella.

30:14.250 --> 30:16.420
But in a way I'm glad.

30:16.920 --> 30:19.590
The pain is my only reminder that
he was real.

30:20.090 --> 30:21.590
That you all were.

30:30.520 --> 30:31.810
All right.

30:31.810 --> 30:32.980
That's it.

30:35.230 --> 30:36.400
What?

30:36.730 --> 30:40.030
You're going to Jacksonville.
Live with your mother.

30:42.490 --> 30:44.160
I'm not leaving Forks.

30:45.660 --> 30:46.910
Bells...

30:48.700 --> 30:50.200
he's not coming back.

30:52.790 --> 30:53.870
I know.

30:55.130 --> 30:58.460
It's just not normal. This behavior.

30:58.750 --> 31:02.760
Quite frankly, it's scaring the hell
out of me. And your mother.

31:03.840 --> 31:06.720
Baby, I don't want you to leave.

31:06.850 --> 31:11.680
I don't, but, just go. Go to Jacksonville.
Make some new friends.

31:11.850 --> 31:13.600
I like my old friends.

31:13.770 --> 31:16.770
- You never see 'em any more.
- I do. I...

31:18.820 --> 31:20.230
m

31:21.610 --> 31:24.700
gonna go shopping tomorrow
with Jessica.

31:25.700 --> 31:28.280
- You hate shopping.
- I...

31:29.740 --> 31:32.290
I need a girl's night out.

31:34.580 --> 31:35.870
All right.

31:36.790 --> 31:39.670
Girl's night. Shopping.

31:40.750 --> 31:43.380
I like it. Go...

31:43.590 --> 31:44.970
buy some stuff.

31:53.180 --> 31:55.390
Hi, Jessica, it's Bella.

31:55.940 --> 31:58.270
Yes, Bella Swan.

32:03.110 --> 32:04.860
- THE DEAD come BACK.
- I don't know why you want to sit through...

32:04.990 --> 32:09.450
all those zombies, eating people and
no hot guys kissing anybody. It's gross.

32:09.780 --> 32:11.870
Why are there that
many zombie movies anyway?

32:11.990 --> 32:14.200
If it's supposed to draw
a parallel about leprosy...

32:14.450 --> 32:16.540
my cousin had leprosy. It's not funny.

32:17.370 --> 32:20.340
And is it supposed to be a metaphor
for consumerism?

32:20.630 --> 32:25.050
Cause don't be so pleased with
your own self-referential cleverness.

32:25.550 --> 32:28.970
Some girls like to shop.
Not all girls, apparently.

32:29.050 --> 32:31.890
Although I was surprised you
even called at all.

32:32.720 --> 32:35.310
Your depression thing, I get it,
I'm totally worried.

32:35.640 --> 32:36.350
But you're still bumming?
I'm going through stuff, too.

32:36.810 --> 32:37.850
You want a ride, girls?

32:39.020 --> 32:39.940
You know?

32:40.190 --> 32:40.980
What's up?

32:41.860 --> 32:44.690
It's hard, you know?
And since when does "just friends"...

32:44.900 --> 32:45.780
What's up, guys?

32:56.500 --> 32:58.040
Keep walking.

32:59.710 --> 33:01.210
This is dangerous.

33:10.800 --> 33:12.010
Dude, come on.

33:12.300 --> 33:13.680
Come here for a sec!

33:17.560 --> 33:19.560
I think I know those guys.

33:20.650 --> 33:22.940
We got beer! We got bikes!

33:23.270 --> 33:26.070
Well, they seem great. Can we go?

33:26.860 --> 33:28.280
I'm just gonna see something.

33:29.990 --> 33:31.660
Hey, girlie!

33:35.870 --> 33:38.250
All right! We got a taker.

33:39.120 --> 33:40.620
Turn around.

34:04.150 --> 34:05.480
I'm sorry, I thought
you were somebody else.

34:05.770 --> 34:08.030
No, that's cool.
I'll be whoever you want me to be, honey.

34:08.320 --> 34:09.400
So...

34:10.070 --> 34:11.659
what do you say?

34:15.949 --> 34:18.120
You promised me, nothing reckless.

34:21.960 --> 34:25.210
You promised it would be as if
you never existed.

34:30.920 --> 34:31.880
You lied.

34:32.219 --> 34:35.100
You say somethin', babe?
You know what? Never mind.

34:52.110 --> 34:53.110
S'£Op!

34:53.699 --> 34:54.860
Stop, stop, 9/EOD!

35:04.750 --> 35:09.960
Hey, what the hell's wrong with you?
Just curious.

35:11.130 --> 35:12.920
I thought that I saw something.

35:13.010 --> 35:18.010
You thought-? You're insane, actually.
Or suicidal.

35:18.260 --> 35:21.140
That homeboy could've been a psycho.

35:21.220 --> 35:24.980
I was about to end up in an FBI
interview room like some lame TV show.

35:25.770 --> 35:27.770
That was such a rush.

35:29.190 --> 35:32.360
Awesome. So you're
an adrenaline junkie now? That's cool.

35:32.780 --> 35:33.280
You can go bungee jumping.

35:33.610 --> 35:36.610
You don't get on
some random loser's motorcycle.

35:36.820 --> 35:37.820
Crazy.

35:42.330 --> 35:43.540
Alice...

35:44.120 --> 35:45.500
I saw him.

35:47.080 --> 35:50.170
Maybe I'm crazy now. I guess that's okay.

35:52.130 --> 35:55.180
If a rush of danger is what
it takes to see him...

35:55.430 --> 35:57.050
then that's what I'll find.

36:01.640 --> 36:02.930
Bella!

36:03.930 --> 36:06.520
Where the hell have you been, loca?

36:11.610 --> 36:12.530
I brought you something.

36:13.150 --> 36:14.190
Okay.

36:14.690 --> 36:16.200
It's a little crazy.

36:20.780 --> 36:22.040
Wow!

36:22.290 --> 36:24.580
Scrap metal. You shouldn't have.

36:24.950 --> 36:26.620
I saved it from the junkyard.

36:29.080 --> 36:32.090
I think they'll probably cost more to fix
than they're worth.

36:33.170 --> 36:36.760
But then I thought that if I had
a mechanic friend to help me out then...

36:37.050 --> 36:39.680
Me being the mechanic-type friend?

36:39.890 --> 36:41.050
That's right.

36:41.430 --> 36:43.100
Since when are you into motorcycles?

36:43.430 --> 36:44.600
Since now.

36:49.730 --> 36:53.730
I get it if you think that
this is really stupid and reckless.

36:54.030 --> 36:57.110
Yeah, it's completely stupid
and reckless.

36:59.700 --> 37:01.030
When do we start?

37:05.540 --> 37:06.790
Now.

37:07.660 --> 37:09.370
- Please?
- Alright.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.340
Wait, be careful.
Those things are actually really...

37:14.710 --> 37:16.260
heavy, so...

37:21.430 --> 37:26.890
Jake, you're like buff. How did
that happen? You're 16. I don't get it.

37:27.230 --> 37:29.640
Age is just a number, baby.
What are you, 40 now?

37:34.110 --> 37:35.690
It feels like that sometimes.

37:46.450 --> 37:49.250
That song's good. You don't like it?

37:50.420 --> 37:52.290
I don't really like...

37:52.830 --> 37:55.170
music any more, kind of.

37:55.500 --> 37:58.880
Okay. No more music.

38:01.180 --> 38:03.140
So I was thinking,
if we're gonna do this every day.

38:03.510 --> 38:05.260
And hopefully we will.

38:05.260 --> 38:07.970
We have to fit some homework
in there somewhere.

38:08.100 --> 38:11.100
I don't want Billy thinking that
I'm a bad influence on you.

38:11.230 --> 38:14.650
You? Influence me? Please.

38:16.440 --> 38:19.740
Are you-? I'm older than you. So...

38:20.030 --> 38:22.360
that makes me the influencer.
And you the influencee.

38:22.780 --> 38:28.080
No no no. My size and knowledge base
actually makes me older than you...

38:28.370 --> 38:30.620
because of your general paleness and
lack of know-how.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.120
I convinced you to build
2-wheeled death machines with me.

38:33.460 --> 38:35.420
Don't you think that makes you
kinda young and naive?

38:36.840 --> 38:39.210
Okay. So where do we stand?

38:40.300 --> 38:43.470
I'm 35. And you might be 32.

38:43.760 --> 38:44.220
Come on.

38:44.470 --> 38:47.930
- Yo. Jake, You in there?
- It's okay. It's just my boys.

38:48.180 --> 38:50.850
- Hey, Jake.
- Hey. Guys, this is Bella.

38:50.930 --> 38:53.350
- Bella, that's Quil and Embry.
- Hi.

38:54.020 --> 38:55.310
I'm Quil Ateara.

38:57.820 --> 38:59.650
So the bike building story is true.

38:59.980 --> 39:01.990
Yeah, I taught him everything he knows.

39:02.320 --> 39:04.240
What about the part
where you're his girlfriend?

39:06.570 --> 39:08.120
We're friends.

39:08.370 --> 39:10.250
- Burn.
- Actually...

39:10.330 --> 39:13.210
remember I said
she's a girl and a friend.

39:13.290 --> 39:15.080
Embiy, do you remember him
making that distinction?

39:15.330 --> 39:16.000
Nope.

39:16.330 --> 39:18.500
So you guys have girlfriends?
That's awesome.

39:19.840 --> 39:23.300
Yeah, right. Quil's
actually taking his cousin to prom.

39:24.220 --> 39:25.390
Yeah, that's still a riot.

39:25.390 --> 39:27.390
You want funny, Black? I'll give you funny.

39:29.680 --> 39:31.180
Jeez.

39:31.310 --> 39:32.430
That hold is illegal!

39:32.770 --> 39:34.350
I got 5 bucks on Quil.

39:34.730 --> 39:36.020
You're on.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.460
Dear Alice...

40:00.460 --> 40:02.340
I wish I had your real address.

40:03.210 --> 40:05.300
I wish I could tell you about Jake.

40:06.010 --> 40:08.220
He makes me feel better.

40:09.220 --> 40:12.310
I mean, he makes me feel alive.

40:14.350 --> 40:16.100
The hole in my chest...

40:17.270 --> 40:19.400
When I'm with Jake...

40:20.320 --> 40:22.110
it's like it's almost healed.

40:22.610 --> 40:23.940
For a while.

40:25.150 --> 40:26.450
So Quil keeps asking to come over.

40:26.780 --> 40:28.780
I think he likes you a little too much.

40:30.830 --> 40:34.160
Well, I'm really not into
the whole cougar thing. You know?

40:36.960 --> 40:39.210
What's up with you and age?

40:39.380 --> 40:42.420
I mean, how old was that Cullen guy,
anyway?

40:45.010 --> 40:47.430
But even Jake can't keep
the dreams away.

40:56.560 --> 40:58.690
Hey, hey, hey!

40:59.230 --> 41:03.480
Wake up, Bella. Ssh! You're okay.
You're okay.

41:13.910 --> 41:18.870
I thought this thing was starting to work,
but I guess not.

41:24.550 --> 41:26.300
Can I ask you something?

41:28.760 --> 41:30.760
Hanging out with Jacob...

41:31.510 --> 41:35.310
that seems to take your mind off
things a bit, doesn't it?

41:40.310 --> 41:42.230
You know, sometimes...

41:43.940 --> 41:46.940
you gotta learn to love
what's good for you.

41:48.110 --> 41:49.450
You know what I mean?

41:52.570 --> 41:53.990
Of course, what do I know?

41:54.830 --> 41:57.370
I'm just a terminal bachelor.

41:59.540 --> 42:01.290
Famous ladies' man.

42:03.920 --> 42:05.250
Okay.

42:07.170 --> 42:08.340
I'll go to bed.

42:10.720 --> 42:11.840
I love you.

42:18.430 --> 42:23.230
If I told you I couldn't fix these bikes,
what would you have said?

42:25.520 --> 42:28.030
Are you doubting your mad skills?

42:28.570 --> 42:32.530
No. Definitely not. They'll run fine.

42:32.700 --> 42:34.950
It's just...

42:36.280 --> 42:39.500
maybe if I was smart,
I woulda dragged out the rebuild a bit.

42:43.880 --> 42:47.550
If you told me you couldn't fix
these bikes, I would say that's...

42:48.130 --> 42:50.470
really too bad, but...

42:50.550 --> 42:53.510
that we're just gonna have
to find something else to do.

42:58.220 --> 42:59.850
Is that Sam Uley?

43:00.770 --> 43:02.060
Yeah.

43:02.350 --> 43:03.520
Him and his cult.

43:06.270 --> 43:07.320
Oh my God.

43:10.530 --> 43:11.940
Did you see that?

43:18.280 --> 43:22.040
They're not really fighting, Bella.
They're cliff diving.

43:22.330 --> 43:25.500
Scary as hell. But a total rush.

43:27.920 --> 43:30.670
- A rush?
- Most of us jump from lower down.

43:30.960 --> 43:33.630
We leave the showing off to Sam and
his disciples.

43:36.470 --> 43:38.390
You have some kind of beef with him
or something?

43:40.770 --> 43:42.060
I don't know.

43:42.520 --> 43:44.600
They just think they run this place.

43:45.310 --> 43:48.310
Embry used to call them hall monitors
on steroids.

43:48.560 --> 43:50.650
- Now look at him.
- That's Embry?

43:52.570 --> 43:53.570
Yeah.

43:53.570 --> 43:54.700
What happened to him?

43:55.490 --> 43:56.990
He missed some school.

43:57.280 --> 44:00.790
Then all of a sudden, he started following
Sam around like a little puppy.

44:01.200 --> 44:03.580
Same thing happened with
Paul and Jared.

44:04.620 --> 44:06.580
Sam keeps giving me this look.

44:08.750 --> 44:11.340
Like he's waiting for me or something.

44:12.800 --> 44:14.970
It's kinda starting to freak me out.

44:15.590 --> 44:17.590
You should just avoid him.

44:20.100 --> 44:21.220
I UV...

44:38.530 --> 44:39.620
Okay.

44:43.330 --> 44:45.450
- You look scared.
- I'm not.

44:46.710 --> 44:47.790
All right.

44:48.040 --> 44:50.380
- Brake?
- That one.

44:53.210 --> 44:54.630
Clutch?

44:54.760 --> 44:56.050
Good.

44:56.380 --> 44:57.720
Gas?

44:59.970 --> 45:01.510
Ready?

45:02.390 --> 45:05.980
Now, slowly release the clutch.

45:07.600 --> 45:09.060
Bella.

45:12.270 --> 45:13.360
S'toP...

45:15.070 --> 45:16.570
Whoa.

45:18.650 --> 45:20.160
You all right?

45:21.450 --> 45:22.740
I'm gonna go again.

45:23.740 --> 45:24.660
Okay.

45:40.930 --> 45:43.470
Whoa whoa whoa!

45:43.600 --> 45:44.760
Hit the brake.

45:59.740 --> 46:00.820
I'm gonna go again.

46:00.910 --> 46:02.660
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

46:02.870 --> 46:05.120
- I want to go again.
- No. Forget it.

46:05.870 --> 46:07.500
No more bikes.

46:08.700 --> 46:10.410
Man, your head.

46:10.710 --> 46:15.420
- Yeah.
- Oh my God, I'm sorry.

46:16.670 --> 46:18.880
You're apologizing for bleeding?

46:21.380 --> 46:23.470
Yeah. I guess I am.

46:24.220 --> 46:27.390
It's just blood, Bella. No big deal.

46:34.310 --> 46:35.520
There.

46:40.190 --> 46:41.860
What are you staring at?

46:45.620 --> 46:47.580
You're sort of beautiful.

46:55.420 --> 46:57.040
How hard did you hit your head?

46:59.210 --> 47:00.670
I don't know.

47:02.880 --> 47:03.880
Let's go.

47:07.760 --> 47:09.430
I did see something in the woods.

47:09.680 --> 47:11.060
Totally. Baby, I believe you.

47:11.350 --> 47:13.640
No, he doesn't.
He's just trying to get lucky.

47:14.810 --> 47:18.690
No, okay. It was jet black. And huge.

47:19.020 --> 47:22.950
On all fours, it was still taller than
a person. A bear, maybe?

47:23.280 --> 47:25.530
Or an alien.
You're lucky you didn't get probed.

47:26.910 --> 47:29.290
Well, I saw it.

47:29.830 --> 47:31.370
You're not the only one.

47:32.580 --> 47:34.790
My Dad's been getting reports
at the station.

47:35.040 --> 47:38.040
Like, 5 hikers have been killed by
some bear.

47:38.250 --> 47:39.880
But they can't find the bear.

47:43.470 --> 47:45.840
Last time you clowns doubt my girlfriend.

47:50.510 --> 47:52.140
So? I mean...

47:52.930 --> 47:54.390
Bella's back.

47:58.060 --> 47:59.690
Yeah, I guess so.

47:59.940 --> 48:01.730
All right, that's-Well, welcome.

48:03.440 --> 48:10.790
So listen, now that you're talking and
eating again, which...

48:10.790 --> 48:13.410
You've gotta get that protein in there.

48:14.750 --> 48:19.670
I was just wondering if
you wanted to go see a movie with me.

48:22.960 --> 48:26.470
Yeah. Sure. Yeah, I do.

48:27.720 --> 48:28.680
Cool.

48:28.930 --> 48:31.430
Let me see, we could check out...

48:32.010 --> 48:34.390
"Love Spelled Backwards ls Love".

48:34.980 --> 48:37.850
It's a dumb title,
but it's a romantic comedy,

48:38.230 --> 48:39.190
- It's supposed to be pretty-
- No.

48:39.400 --> 48:40.900
No romance.

48:44.400 --> 48:47.450
How 'bout "Face Punch"?
Have you heard of that?

48:48.450 --> 48:50.990
I mean, that's an action movie.

48:50.990 --> 48:52.370
Yeah, it's perfect.

48:53.740 --> 48:55.200
Guns, adrenaline.

48:56.290 --> 48:57.460
That's my thing.

48:57.710 --> 48:58.960
Okay.

48:59.170 --> 49:01.790
We should get a bunch of people to go.

49:02.710 --> 49:04.880
- "Face Punch"?
- "Face Punch"? Yeah!

49:04.960 --> 49:07.840
Mike? We were supposed to watch that.
Remember, the trailer's like...

49:08.090 --> 49:10.300
- Punch faces!
- I remember.

49:10.640 --> 49:13.680
Yeah! Movie night with Bella.

49:16.350 --> 49:18.060
So "Face Punch", huh?

49:18.890 --> 49:20.770
You like action movies?

49:21.730 --> 49:23.110
Not really.

49:26.030 --> 49:29.410
I heard it sucks. Bad.

49:30.200 --> 49:33.410
Are you even old enough
to see this movie?

49:34.120 --> 49:36.620
I mean, without adult supervision.

49:36.950 --> 49:39.870
- She's buying my ticket for me.
- She's buying it. Okay.

49:41.170 --> 49:46.170
Jessica bailed and Angela got the
stomach flu. So Eric's taking care of her.

49:47.380 --> 49:48.420
It's just us 3.

49:48.670 --> 49:49.590
Great!

49:50.630 --> 49:52.600
- Great.
- Yeah.

49:55.600 --> 49:56.890
Put your gun down.

49:57.060 --> 49:59.770
Put your gun down. Or I'm gonna
blow your frickin' head off.

50:00.060 --> 50:05.230
Put your guns down. Or I'm gonna
blow both of your frickin' heads off.

50:06.780 --> 50:08.320
All right, forget it, let's do this!

50:26.300 --> 50:28.420
Okay, I think I'm gonna throw up.

50:35.010 --> 50:36.060
He's...

50:37.010 --> 50:38.600
What a marshmallow!

50:39.520 --> 50:43.020
You should hold out for someone
with a stronger stomach.

50:43.020 --> 50:46.320
Someone who laughs at the gore that
makes weaker men vomit.

50:46.610 --> 50:48.860
Yeah. I'll keep my eye open for that.

50:50.780 --> 50:55.700
I feel bad. He probably has that
flu that's going around.

50:58.370 --> 51:00.200
I can't hold your hand?

51:01.080 --> 51:02.620
Of course you can.

51:05.580 --> 51:09.670
I just think it means something
a little different to you. So...

51:11.760 --> 51:13.340
Okay, tell me something...

51:13.630 --> 51:15.300
you like me, right?

51:20.020 --> 51:22.890
And you think I'm "sort of beautiful."

51:23.940 --> 51:25.980
Jacob, please...

51:26.440 --> 51:28.230
don't do this.

51:34.240 --> 51:35.530
Why?

51:38.910 --> 51:41.000
Because you're about to ruin everything.

51:43.410 --> 51:47.170
And I need you.

51:53.090 --> 51:54.930
Well, I've got loads of time.

51:56.510 --> 51:58.050
I'm not gonna give up.

51:59.720 --> 52:03.140
I don't want you to. But...

52:04.520 --> 52:07.100
it's just 'cause
I don't want you to go anywhere.

52:10.230 --> 52:12.860
And that's really selfish.

52:16.030 --> 52:19.160
You know, I'm not like a car that
you can fix up.

52:23.330 --> 52:27.830
I'm never gonna run right.
So I should be fair to you.

52:29.960 --> 52:31.880
It's because of him, right?

52:42.310 --> 52:43.720
Look...

52:45.270 --> 52:47.600
I know what he did to you.

52:49.060 --> 52:50.940
But, Bella...

52:51.110 --> 52:54.530
I would never ever do that.

52:56.110 --> 53:00.070
I won't ever hurt you. I promise.

53:00.820 --> 53:02.580
I won't let you down.

53:03.660 --> 53:05.410
You can count on me.

53:13.380 --> 53:14.550
Well...

53:19.640 --> 53:21.640
I need to go home.

53:28.270 --> 53:32.150
I was feeling sick before the movie.
Okay?

53:34.730 --> 53:36.360
What is your problem?

53:36.360 --> 53:38.820
Right now? You're my problem.

53:39.200 --> 53:42.780
Feeling sick?
Maybe you need to go to the hospital.

53:43.370 --> 53:45.330
You want me to put you in the hospital?

53:45.620 --> 53:48.660
Jake! The movie's over.
What are you doing?

53:49.460 --> 53:52.710
You're really hot.

53:53.590 --> 53:56.550
Like you have a fever. Are you okay?

53:57.630 --> 53:59.880
I don't know what's happening.

54:02.050 --> 54:03.260
I gotta go.

54:08.770 --> 54:10.230
Dude is weird.

54:13.860 --> 54:17.110
Jake, your Dad says you have mono.

54:17.190 --> 54:20.700
He won't let me visit,
but would you call me?

54:26.030 --> 54:29.450
Hey, it's me again. I just...

54:29.660 --> 54:32.170
I'm sorry about what
I said at the movie theater.

54:33.710 --> 54:37.210
I just wanted to hear your voice,
so no pressure.

54:39.970 --> 54:42.180
Jacob, please...

54:43.180 --> 54:44.300
Call me.

54:44.930 --> 54:47.810
Okay. We should be back around 3.

54:54.310 --> 54:55.230
He)'

54:56.570 --> 54:58.530
I don't have to go fishing today.

54:58.820 --> 55:00.110
Yes, you do.

55:00.360 --> 55:03.070
Yeah. Go. What are you talking about?

55:03.240 --> 55:04.530
Just be careful.

55:04.990 --> 55:06.200
Always am.

55:08.200 --> 55:10.330
Those bears won't get the drop on me,
Bella.

55:10.660 --> 55:12.410
My Kung Fu is strong.

55:45.910 --> 55:47.070
Jake!

55:48.200 --> 55:49.240
Hey!

55:54.250 --> 55:56.250
You cut your hair off?

55:58.920 --> 56:00.840
And got a tattoo?

56:04.050 --> 56:05.380
Bella.

56:05.510 --> 56:08.180
I thought you were too sick
to come outside.

56:09.390 --> 56:12.430
Or pick up the phone when I call.

56:13.270 --> 56:14.940
Go away.

56:15.890 --> 56:17.230
What?

56:18.650 --> 56:20.400
Go away.

56:21.980 --> 56:25.490
What happened to you?
What's wrong-? Hey!

56:25.570 --> 56:26.990
What happened?

56:29.410 --> 56:31.290
Did Sam get to you?

56:31.370 --> 56:32.490
Is that what's happening?

56:32.790 --> 56:36.870
Sam's trying to help me.
Don't blame him.

56:37.250 --> 56:39.290
But if you want somebody to blame...

56:39.580 --> 56:42.500
how about those filthy bloodsuckers
youlove?

56:42.710 --> 56:44.420
The Cullens.

56:50.760 --> 56:54.390
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- No, you know exactly what I'm talking about.

56:54.850 --> 56:58.400
You've been lying to everyone.

56:59.940 --> 57:01.980
But you can't lie to me.

57:03.190 --> 57:05.780
- Not any more, Bella.
- Jacob!

57:06.070 --> 57:07.400
Jacob!

57:13.290 --> 57:14.950
Look, Bella...

57:15.910 --> 57:18.000
We can't be friends any more.

57:19.290 --> 57:21.840
Jake, I know that I've been...

57:22.340 --> 57:28.630
hurting you.
It's killing me. It kills me.

57:30.090 --> 57:33.390
I just need-Maybe-
Give me some time or something.

57:35.890 --> 57:37.640
It's not you.

57:40.480 --> 57:43.770
It's not you, it's me, right? Really?

57:44.190 --> 57:47.360
It's true. It is me.

57:49.320 --> 57:52.410
I'm not good.

57:54.330 --> 57:56.040
I used to be.

57:56.290 --> 57:58.080
A good kid.

57:58.870 --> 58:00.750
Not any more.

58:01.460 --> 58:04.210
This doesn't even matter. All right?

58:04.460 --> 58:05.420
This is over.

58:05.590 --> 58:07.590
You can't break up with me.

58:09.380 --> 58:11.130
I mean...

58:12.260 --> 58:14.640
I mean you're my best friend.

58:16.930 --> 58:18.600
You promised me.

58:20.140 --> 58:21.560
I know.

58:22.350 --> 58:24.940
I promised I wouldn't hurt you, Bella.

58:25.770 --> 58:28.440
And this is me keeping that promise.

58:29.070 --> 58:30.490
Go home.

58:31.280 --> 58:35.280
And don't come back.
Or you're gonna get hurt.

58:48.550 --> 58:49.880
Alice...

58:50.420 --> 58:52.380
Things are...

58:53.550 --> 58:55.300
Things are bad again.

58:56.850 --> 59:01.020
Without Jake, I just can't stand it.

59:03.230 --> 59:05.520
I don't see Edward any more.

59:07.070 --> 59:09.530
Will it really feel like he never existed?

59:17.530 --> 59:20.330
I will find a place where
I can see him again.

01:00:16.010 --> 01:00:17.510
Bella.

01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:19.680
Laurent.

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.560
I didn't expect to find you here.

01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:29.020
I went to visit the Cullens, but...

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:31.400
the house is empty.

01:00:32.530 --> 01:00:35.450
I'm surprised they left you behind.

01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:37.660
Weren't you sort of a...

01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:40.410
pet of theirs?

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:42.660
You could say that.

01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:46.000
Do the Cullens visit often?

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:51.670
Lie.

01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:58.300
Yeah, all the time.

01:00:58.590 --> 01:00:59.760
Lie better.

01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:02.720
I'll tell them that you stopped by.

01:01:03.350 --> 01:01:05.480
But I probably shouldn't...

01:01:05.730 --> 01:01:07.310
I'm surprised they left you behind.

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:09.440
Edward.

01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:11.610
'Cause he's pretty protective.

01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:14.860
But he's far away, isn't he?

01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:18.660
Why are you here?

01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:20.740
I came as a...

01:01:21.490 --> 01:01:23.660
favor to Victoria.

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:27.160
Victoria?

01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:31.790
She asked me to see if you were
still under the protection of the Cullens.

01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:35.170
Victoria feels it's only fair
to kill Edward's mate...

01:01:35.590 --> 01:01:37.470
given he killed hers.

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:39.760
An eye for an eye.

01:01:40.090 --> 01:01:41.050
Threaten him.

01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:44.850
Edward would know who did it.
And he'd come after you.

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:48.060
I don't think he will.

01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:51.770
After all, how much could you mean
to him...

01:01:52.310 --> 01:01:55.610
if he left you here unprotected?

01:01:56.860 --> 01:01:59.780
Victoria won't be happy
about my killing you.

01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:02.700
But I can't help myself.

01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:04.410
You are so mouth-watering.

01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:07.700
Please, don't. I mean, you helped us.

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:10.710
Ssh! Don't be afraid.

01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:12.790
I'm doing you a kindness.

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:16.170
Victoria plans on killing you slowly.

01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:18.470
Painfully.

01:02:19.130 --> 01:02:21.890
Whereas I'll make it quick.

01:02:21.890 --> 01:02:23.720
I promise.

01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:26.100
You will feel nothing.

01:02:31.690 --> 01:02:33.360
Edward, I love you.

01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:37.780
I don't believe it.

01:03:44.550 --> 01:03:45.970
Dad! I saw them.

01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:46.970
What's the matter?

01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:49.350
In the woods. They're not bears.

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:52.060
What the hell were you doing out
in the woods?

01:03:52.310 --> 01:03:55.730
They're wolves. I mean,
they're huge wolves.

01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:57.860
Are you sure about that, Bella?

01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:00.530
Yeah! I just saw them. They were after...

01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:01.780
something.

01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:03.320
Wolves?

01:04:04.570 --> 01:04:05.990
You saw 'em?

01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:12.000
All right, well, Harry?

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:15.330
Feel like going hunting?
Get some of your guys together?

01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:19.250
Sure, yeah, I'll just...

01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:22.090
By now, those wolves will be dead.

01:04:23.550 --> 01:04:25.760
And Laurent would have told her
I'm unprotected.

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:27.840
Victoria.

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:31.350
I should go to the station.

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:33.730
Yeah, you should. You should go.

01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:36.770
Can you just stay in the house?

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:02.960
Bella!

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:07.010
You scared me.

01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:08.090
What the hell are you doing?

01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:10.010
Back up. I'm coming up.

01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:23.940
He)'

01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:28.360
Look, I'm sorry.

01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:35.870
For what?

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:39.250
I wish I could explain. But I literally...

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:40.920
can't.

01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:52.680
Have you ever had a secret
you couldn't tell anyone?

01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:56.310
One that wasn't yours to share?

01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:01.190
That's what it's like for me.

01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:03.110
But worse.

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:06.690
You have no idea...

01:06:06.990 --> 01:06:08.700
how tight I'm bound.

01:06:08.950 --> 01:06:10.780
I hate this.

01:06:11.490 --> 01:06:13.620
I hate what they've done to you.

01:06:28.010 --> 01:06:30.880
The killer part is you already know.

01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:36.220
Bella...

01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:40.440
do you remember when
we walked on the beach at La Push?

01:06:41.350 --> 01:06:43.100
The st...

01:06:46.610 --> 01:06:49.940
The story. The story about...

01:06:50.570 --> 01:06:52.070
the cold ones.

01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:57.240
I guess I understand why
that's the only part you remember.

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:07.000
There's gotta be something...

01:07:07.710 --> 01:07:09.300
- that You can do.
- No.

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:11.050
I'm in it for life.

01:07:12.050 --> 01:07:14.390
Maybe we should just get out of here
for a while.

01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:16.350
Just leave.

01:07:16.890 --> 01:07:18.310
Just you and me.

01:07:18.970 --> 01:07:20.640
You'd do that?

01:07:23.650 --> 01:07:25.270
I would do it for you.

01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:35.200
It's not something
I can just run away from, Bella.

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:37.950
But I would...

01:07:38.410 --> 01:07:40.450
run away with you.

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:45.290
If I could.

01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:52.840
I gotta go.
They'll start wondering where I am.

01:07:57.010 --> 01:07:58.050
Come here.

01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:04.440
Please...

01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:07.060
try to remember.

01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:11.110
It'd be so much easier...

01:08:11.730 --> 01:08:13.110
if you knew.

01:08:16.029 --> 01:08:18.779
I'll try. But Jake...

01:08:19.029 --> 01:08:21.830
Jake, what are you doing? Wait!

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.040
Jake.

01:08:47.229 --> 01:08:49.109
Edward, I'm scared.

01:08:49.439 --> 01:08:51.020
You should be.

01:08:56.069 --> 01:08:58.450
Really, it's just an old story.

01:08:58.950 --> 01:09:00.069
I'm not really supposed to say anything
about it...

01:09:00.319 --> 01:09:03.910
Did you know Quileutes are supposedly
descended from wolves?

01:09:18.510 --> 01:09:19.760
Bella?

01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:21.640
I need to see him.

01:09:22.930 --> 01:09:24.180
He's not in.

01:09:26.310 --> 01:09:28.939
- I'm sorry, I really need to see him.
- Bella!

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:46.750
What did you do?

01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:49.210
What did you do?

01:09:49.210 --> 01:09:50.420
- What did You do to him?
- Easy!

01:09:50.750 --> 01:09:51.630
He didn't want this.

01:09:51.830 --> 01:09:53.290
What did we do? What did he do?

01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:54.130
What'd he tell you?

01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:55.130
Both of you calm down.

01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:58.170
He tells me nothing,
because he's scared of you.

01:10:03.930 --> 01:10:04.970
Too late now.

01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:06.180
Bella, get back!

01:10:06.930 --> 01:10:10.230
Paul? Calm down, now!

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:19.530
Bella!

01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:22.240
Run!

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:26.330
Jake, run!

01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:07.490
Hey! Take Bella back to Emily's place.

01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:10.830
Guess the wolf's out of the bag.

01:11:16.250 --> 01:11:17.380
Alice...

01:11:18.090 --> 01:11:23.130
is it possible that everything is true?
The fairy tales and horror stories?

01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:27.810
Is it possible that there isn't anything
sane or normal, at all?

01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:31.100
I think we should go back
and see if Jacob's okay.

01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:33.690
I hope Paul sinks some teeth in him.
Serves him right.

01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:35.560
No way. Jacob's a natural.

01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:36.980
You see him phase on the fly?

01:11:37.230 --> 01:11:39.400
I got $5 says Paul doesn't touch him.

01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:42.070
Come on in, Bella! We won't bite.

01:11:42.450 --> 01:11:43.860
Speak for yourself.

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:56.420
Hey, about Emily, Sam's fiancee?

01:11:56.710 --> 01:11:59.170
Don't stare. It bugs Sam.

01:12:01.010 --> 01:12:02.300
Why would I stare?

01:12:02.970 --> 01:12:06.970
Are you guys hungry? Like I have to ask.

01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:14.690
Who's this?

01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:17.400
Bella Swan. Who else?

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:22.320
So, you're the vampire girl?

01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:27.490
So you're the wolf girl?

01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:32.500
Guess so. Well...

01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:34.290
I'm engaged to one.

01:12:37.210 --> 01:12:42.340
Save some for your brothers.
And ladies first. Muffin?

01:12:42.710 --> 01:12:44.550
Sure. Thanks.

01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:47.890
Leave it to Jacob to find a way
around Sam's gag order.

01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:50.640
He didn't say anything to me.

01:12:50.970 --> 01:12:54.310
That's a wolf thing. Alpha's orders get
obeyed whether we want 'em to or not.

01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:56.890
And check it out!
We can hear each other's thoughts.

01:12:57.190 --> 01:13:00.940
Would you shut up?
These are trade secrets. Damn it!

01:13:01.270 --> 01:13:03.320
This chick runs with vampires.

01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:06.450
You can't really run with vampires.

01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:10.620
'Cause they're fast.

01:13:10.990 --> 01:13:14.580
Yeah? Well, we're faster.

01:13:15.290 --> 01:13:16.660
Freaked out yet?

01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:20.960
You're not the first monsters I've met.

01:13:21.210 --> 01:13:22.500
Jake's right.

01:13:22.590 --> 01:13:24.010
You're good with weird.

01:13:25.630 --> 01:13:27.090
He)'

01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:47.530
Sorry.

01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:03.710
So you're a werewolf?

01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:08.470
Yeah. Last time I checked.

01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:13.550
A few lucky members of
the tribe have the gene.

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:18.480
A bloodsucker moves into town,
and the fever sets in.

01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:21.310
Mono.

01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:25.110
Yeah. I wish.

01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:30.450
Can't you find a way to just...

01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:32.490
stop?

01:14:34.450 --> 01:14:37.200
I mean it's wrong.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.830
It's not a lifestyle choice.

01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:44.460
I was born this way. I can't help it.

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:47.960
You're such a hypocrite. What?
I'm not the right kind of monster for you?

01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:49.630
It's not what you are.

01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:54.430
It's what you do. They never hurt anybody.

01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:57.520
You've killed people.

01:14:57.850 --> 01:15:00.520
Bella, we're not killing anyone.

01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:03.520
Then who is?

01:15:03.730 --> 01:15:06.480
What we're trying to
protect you people from.

01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:09.650
The only thing we do kill.

01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:12.700
Vampires.

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:15.200
Wait, Jake, you can't.

01:15:15.450 --> 01:15:16.030
Don't worry,

01:15:16.490 --> 01:15:18.580
we can't touch
your little precious Cullens unless...

01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:20.580
they violate the Treaty.

01:15:20.830 --> 01:15:22.500
That's not what I'm saying.

01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:26.040
You can't kill vampires. They'll...

01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:27.500
They'll kill you.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.670
Really? We took out that leech with
the dreads easy enough.

01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:36.800
Laurent?

01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:39.220
And his red-headed girlfriend is next.

01:15:40.270 --> 01:15:41.480
Victoria's here?

01:15:41.770 --> 01:15:44.600
Was. We chased her all the way to
the Canadian border the other night.

01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:47.860
She keeps coming back.
We don't know what she's after.

01:15:48.270 --> 01:15:49.530
I do.

01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:53.780
Me.

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:06.080
Don't worry.
We've got this place covered.

01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:08.840
She won't get near you or Charlie.

01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:11.380
You've got to be careful.

01:16:11.710 --> 01:16:14.510
She's fast.
You don't know how fast she is.

01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:17.800
You know, your lack of confidence in us
is a little insulting.

01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:22.100
I'd better go.

01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:24.640
You gotta go?

01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:26.810
Yeah.

01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:29.440
Got a vampire to kill.

01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:45.120
Alice...

01:16:45.410 --> 01:16:46.620
I'm all right.

01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:49.670
Until I'm alone.

01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:53.010
And lately, that's all the time.

01:16:53.630 --> 01:16:56.220
Jacob's gone. He's hunting Victoria.

01:16:56.590 --> 01:16:58.800
And Charlie's hunting Jacob.

01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:00.260
And you're gone.

01:17:01.390 --> 01:17:03.640
And so is Edward.

01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:08.770
There's just nothing now.

01:17:12.690 --> 01:17:13.940
You got something, Harry?

01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:17.740
Nope. Nothing.

01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:27.000
But I realize where I have to go.

01:17:27.370 --> 01:17:29.210
What I have to do to see him again.

01:20:27.850 --> 01:20:29.600
Don't do this.

01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:36.480
You wanted me to be human.

01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:39.860
Watch me.

01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:44.360
Please.

01:20:45.490 --> 01:20:46.490
For me.

01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:48.950
You won't stay with me any other way.

01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:54.370
Bella, please.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.710
Breathe!

01:22:25.090 --> 01:22:26.420
Breathe!

01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:30.090
Come on, Bella, breathe!

01:22:36.970 --> 01:22:40.020
Bella? Bella, can you hear me?

01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:46.940
Jake?

01:22:48.650 --> 01:22:49.990
Come here.

01:22:55.580 --> 01:22:57.450
What the hell were you thinking?

01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:01.210
I just wanted to see something.

01:23:01.670 --> 01:23:05.250
Get her home! I'm gonna
go help out over at Harry's place

01:23:08.340 --> 01:23:10.090
Bella, please.

01:23:10.590 --> 01:23:13.140
Harry Clearvvater had a heart attack.

01:23:13.970 --> 01:23:16.600
Charlie and my Dad are over
at his place with his family.

01:23:16.850 --> 01:23:18.060
Is he okay?

01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:21.560
He's gone.

01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:28.400
Come on. I'll get you something dry
and drive you home.

01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:42.410
Hundred and eight degrees over here.

01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:46.080
God!

01:23:47.090 --> 01:23:49.210
My hands are freezing.

01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:53.090
It must be nice, never getting cold.

01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:55.640
It's a wolf thing.

01:23:56.300 --> 01:23:57.800
It's not.

01:23:58.310 --> 01:24:00.060
It's a Jacob thing.

01:24:00.770 --> 01:24:02.430
You're just warm.

01:24:05.100 --> 01:24:06.810
You're like your own sun.

01:24:10.570 --> 01:24:14.530
Is this better?
Now that you know about me.

01:24:17.410 --> 01:24:18.870
But...?

01:24:23.870 --> 01:24:26.250
You saw what happened to Emily.

01:24:29.540 --> 01:24:31.510
Sam go'E 8n9W...

01:24:32.130 --> 01:24:34.930
Lost it for a split second.

01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:38.260
Em was standing too close.

01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:43.140
He'll never be able to take that back.

01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:47.900
What if I got mad at you?

01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:00.700
Sometimes...

01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:05.750
I feel like I'm gonna disappear.

01:25:12.250 --> 01:25:14.670
Okay, not that you need me...

01:25:15.170 --> 01:25:17.880
to tell you something like this...

01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:23.020
but I always will.
You're not gonna lose yourself.

01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:27.520
I wouldn't let that happen.

01:25:30.060 --> 01:25:31.270
How?

01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:37.780
I'll tell you, all the time...

01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:42.830
how special you are.

01:26:02.220 --> 01:26:05.220
Thank you. For everything.

01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:12.270
Wait.

01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:16.780
There's a vampire.

01:26:17.690 --> 01:26:18.860
How do you know?

01:26:19.610 --> 01:26:22.160
I can smell it.
I'm getting you out of here.

01:26:23.620 --> 01:26:25.370
That's Carlisle's car.

01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:27.660
They're here.

01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:32.380
Bella, it's a trick! Stop!
You gotta come with me!

01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:37.260
They won't hurt me.

01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:40.510
If a Cullen is back here,
this is their territory.

01:26:41.130 --> 01:26:43.510
Treaty says we can only defend on
our own lands.

01:26:43.890 --> 01:26:45.180
I can't protect you here.

01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:47.470
That's okay. You don't have to.

01:26:50.310 --> 01:26:51.980
You're about to cross a line.

01:26:52.310 --> 01:26:53.690
Then don't draw one.

01:26:54.230 --> 01:26:55.400
Please?

01:27:12.330 --> 01:27:13.580
Alice?

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.290
Oh my God! What are you-?

01:27:17.210 --> 01:27:21.260
I'm sorry, I just can't
believe you're here. ls...?

01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:24.260
Would you like to explain to me
how you're alive?

01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:26.260
What?

01:27:26.510 --> 01:27:30.480
I saw a vision of you.
You jumped off a cliff.

01:27:30.730 --> 01:27:34.150
Why in the hell would you try and
kill yourself? What about Charlie?

01:27:34.350 --> 01:27:36.150
I didn't try to kill myself.

01:27:36.940 --> 01:27:38.360
I was cliff jumping.

01:27:38.650 --> 01:27:40.240
Recreationally.

01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:42.150
It was fun.

01:27:43.950 --> 01:27:48.660
I have never met anyone more prone to
life-threatening idiocy.

01:27:53.370 --> 01:27:57.210
Did you tell him?

01:27:57.460 --> 01:27:58.340
No.

01:28:00.010 --> 01:28:03.720
He only calls in once every few months.

01:28:04.340 --> 01:28:06.760
He said he wants to be alone.

01:28:12.430 --> 01:28:16.440
What is that God-awful wet dog smell?

01:28:19.110 --> 01:28:21.110
That's probably me.

01:28:21.820 --> 01:28:24.990
Or it's Jacob.

01:28:25.450 --> 01:28:26.780
Jacob who?

01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:30.700
Jacob's kind of a werewolf.

01:28:31.750 --> 01:28:35.620
Bella! Werewolves are not
good company to keep.

01:28:36.420 --> 01:28:37.790
Speak for yourself.

01:28:43.090 --> 01:28:45.180
I had to see you were safe.

01:28:46.590 --> 01:28:48.930
I thought you couldn't protect me here.

01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:51.510
Guess I don't care.

01:28:55.390 --> 01:28:57.520
I'm not gonna hurt her.

01:28:59.060 --> 01:29:00.980
No, you're just a harmless Cullen.

01:29:01.230 --> 01:29:04.490
I'm talking about the other bloodsucker
who tried to kill Bella because of you.

01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:05.490
Victoria?

01:29:05.820 --> 01:29:07.490
Yeah, Victoria's been around.

01:29:07.950 --> 01:29:09.700
I didn't see her.

01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:13.370
I didn't see you get pulled out
of the water, either.

01:29:14.450 --> 01:29:17.670
I can't see past you and
your pack of mutts.

01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:19.960
Don't get me upset.

01:29:20.380 --> 01:29:20.790
Stop. Stop.

01:29:21.210 --> 01:29:23.210
I'm not gonna hurt her.

01:29:30.430 --> 01:29:31.810
I'll give you a minute.

01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:38.520
He)'

01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:42.270
You're not going anywhere.
You're gonna come back.

01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:44.820
- Right?
- As soon As You put THE dog out.

01:29:53.950 --> 01:29:55.080
Is he-?

01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:02.710
Are there others? How many Cullens
are here and how long are they staying?

01:30:03.460 --> 01:30:04.670
No.

01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:07.010
It's just Alice.

01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:14.010
And she can stay as long as she'd like.

01:30:17.060 --> 01:30:18.690
Are the rest coming back?

01:30:25.570 --> 01:30:26.940
No.

01:30:28.450 --> 01:30:30.740
Not that I know of.

01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:32.950
Anything else?

01:30:36.910 --> 01:30:38.580
That's it.

01:30:40.540 --> 01:30:44.090
If that's all,
then you'd better go run back to Sam.

01:30:47.260 --> 01:30:48.590
I've done it again.

01:30:50.260 --> 01:30:52.550
I keep breaking my promise.

01:30:57.560 --> 01:30:59.810
We don't have to do this to each other.

01:31:04.610 --> 01:31:06.150
Yes, we do.

01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:19.580
Bella...

01:31:42.270 --> 01:31:43.900
Swan residence.

01:31:49.690 --> 01:31:51.690
He's not here right now.

01:31:52.740 --> 01:31:54.570
He's arranging a funeral.

01:32:10.380 --> 01:32:11.710
Who was that?

01:32:12.630 --> 01:32:13.470
What?

01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:15.300
Always in the way.

01:32:17.430 --> 01:32:18.560
Who was that?

01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:20.270
Bella, step back.

01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:23.690
- Who was that?
- It's Edward.

01:32:24.140 --> 01:32:25.690
He thinks you're dead.

01:32:25.690 --> 01:32:28.020
Rosalie told him why I came here.

01:32:29.820 --> 01:32:32.570
Why didn't you let me speak to him?

01:32:32.990 --> 01:32:33.780
He didn't ask for you.

01:32:34.070 --> 01:32:37.280
- I don't care!
- He's going to the Volturi.

01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:39.780
He wants to die, too.

01:32:42.580 --> 01:32:45.210
He left you, Bella.
He didn't want you any more. Remember?

01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:48.540
I'm not gonna let him kill himself
out of guilt.

01:32:49.540 --> 01:32:50.840
What about your Dad?

01:32:51.710 --> 01:32:55.380
I'm 18. I'm legally free to go and
I left a note.

01:32:57.090 --> 01:32:58.640
Please, Bella...

01:32:59.930 --> 01:33:02.720
just stay here.

01:33:03.890 --> 01:33:05.640
For Charlie.

01:33:08.190 --> 01:33:09.650
Or for me.

01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:12.690
I have to go.

01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:19.870
I'm begging you.

01:33:22.740 --> 01:33:23.700
Please.

01:33:25.830 --> 01:33:27.750
Goodbye, Jacob.

01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:36.670
Okay.

01:34:38.860 --> 01:34:40.820
So you've made up your minds.

01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:44.240
I'm afraid your particular gifts...

01:34:44.910 --> 01:34:47.580
are too valuable to destroy.

01:34:47.910 --> 01:34:51.790
But, if you're unhappy with your lot...

01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:53.500
join us.

01:34:54.130 --> 01:34:58.300
We would be delighted to utilize
yourskms.

01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:01.630
Won't you consider staying with us?

01:35:03.180 --> 01:35:05.140
You know it will happen anyway.

01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:08.270
Not without cause.

01:35:11.730 --> 01:35:13.480
Such a waste.

01:35:20.530 --> 01:35:22.320
I'm guessing you didn't rent this car?

01:35:22.530 --> 01:35:24.660
I figured you wouldn't be opposed to
grand theft auto.

01:35:24.870 --> 01:35:25.910
Not today.

01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:30.960
What? What do you see?

01:35:31.290 --> 01:35:32.670
They refused him.

01:35:32.870 --> 01:35:35.630
So? He's gonna make a scene.

01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:38.800
- Show himself to The humans.
- No! When?

01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:41.970
He's gonna wait until noon.
When the sun's at its highest.

01:35:45.510 --> 01:35:46.800
God, Alice, you gotta hurry up.

01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:48.010
There's Volterra.

01:36:13.460 --> 01:36:16.080
- Why are they All in red?
- San Marco's Day festival.

01:36:16.380 --> 01:36:19.000
They're commemorating
the expulsion of vampires from the city.

01:36:19.380 --> 01:36:20.550
It's the perfect setting.

01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:23.130
The Volturi will never let him
reveal himself.

01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:24.880
We have 5 minutes.

01:36:25.220 --> 01:36:27.680
Bella, just breathe.

01:36:33.770 --> 01:36:34.440
Alice!

01:36:34.770 --> 01:36:36.730
Bella, you're the only one
he can't see coming.

01:36:36.980 --> 01:36:39.860
If I go, he'll read my thoughts,
he'll think I'm lying, he'll rush into it.

01:36:40.730 --> 01:36:41.360
Where do I go?

01:36:41.650 --> 01:36:43.530
He'll be under the clock tower. Go!

01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:37.930
Don't!

01:38:39.810 --> 01:38:41.100
Heaven.

01:38:41.190 --> 01:38:42.520
You have to move.

01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:44.980
Open your eyes. Look at me.

01:38:45.190 --> 01:38:46.480
I'm alive.

01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:48.530
You have to move.

01:38:49.610 --> 01:38:50.860
Bella.

01:38:58.200 --> 01:39:01.500
- You're here.
- I'm here.

01:39:03.130 --> 01:39:04.960
Bella!

01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:09.130
Yes.

01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:21.190
I needed to make you see me once.

01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:26.070
You had to know I was alive, that
you didn't have to feel guilty or anything.

01:39:29.490 --> 01:39:33.490
I can let you go now.

01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:39.080
I never acted out of guilt.

01:39:41.460 --> 01:39:44.540
I just couldn't live in a world
where you don't exist.

01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:49.260
But you said... I lied.

01:39:49.460 --> 01:39:53.130
I had to lie.
But you believed me so easily.

01:39:58.010 --> 01:40:00.220
Because it doesn't make sense.

01:40:00.390 --> 01:40:02.100
For you to love me.

01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:08.360
I'm nothing. I'm human. I'm nothing.

01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:10.320
Bella...

01:40:11.070 --> 01:40:13.530
you're everything to me.

01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:16.240
You're everything.

01:40:42.100 --> 01:40:44.100
I won't be needing your services
after all, gentlemen.

01:40:44.390 --> 01:40:46.230
Aro wants to speak with you again.

01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:47.650
No rules were broken.

01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:51.820
Nonetheless we should take this
to a more appropriate venue.

01:40:52.070 --> 01:40:53.110
Fine.

01:40:54.530 --> 01:40:57.030
Bella, why don't you go and
enjoy the rest of the festival?

01:40:57.160 --> 01:40:58.320
The girl comes with us.

01:40:58.700 --> 01:41:00.200
No. You can go to hell.

01:41:02.540 --> 01:41:04.160
Come on, guys.

01:41:04.410 --> 01:41:07.670
It's a festival.
You wouldn't want to make a scene.

01:41:08.630 --> 01:41:10.040
We wouldn't.

01:41:10.290 --> 01:41:11.710
Enough.

01:41:13.260 --> 01:41:14.340
Jane.

01:41:15.090 --> 01:41:17.890
Aro sent me to see
what was taking so long.

01:41:26.310 --> 01:41:28.150
Just do as she says.

01:41:40.910 --> 01:41:42.200
Go ahead.

01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:47.830
Don't be scared.

01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:50.170
Are you?

01:41:51.170 --> 01:41:52.130
No.

01:42:30.790 --> 01:42:33.250
- Is she human?
- Yes.

01:42:36.010 --> 01:42:37.170
Does she know?

01:42:38.130 --> 01:42:39.380
Yes.

01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:41.340
Then, why would...

01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:44.810
She wants to be.

01:42:45.260 --> 01:42:46.890
And so she will be.

01:42:47.140 --> 01:42:48.390
Or dessert.

01:42:56.900 --> 01:42:59.280
Sister. They send you out to get one...

01:42:59.700 --> 01:43:00.990
and you bring back two.

01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:02.780
And a half.

01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:05.280
Such a clever girl.

01:43:05.700 --> 01:43:07.830
What a happy surprise!

01:43:08.330 --> 01:43:11.830
Bella is alive after all.

01:43:12.120 --> 01:43:15.500
Isn't that wonderful?

01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:18.090
I love a happy ending.

01:43:22.130 --> 01:43:24.140
They are so rare.

01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:33.440
Her blood appeals to you so much...

01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:36.320
it makes me thirsty.

01:43:36.730 --> 01:43:39.490
How can you stand to be so close to her?

01:43:39.820 --> 01:43:41.360
It's not without difficulty.

01:43:41.490 --> 01:43:43.410
Yes, I can see that.

01:43:45.950 --> 01:43:50.200
Aro can read every thought
I've ever had with one touch.

01:43:50.580 --> 01:43:53.080
And now you know everything.

01:43:53.420 --> 01:43:55.290
So get on with it.

01:43:58.340 --> 01:44:02.510
You are quite a soul reader yourself,
Edward.

01:44:03.260 --> 01:44:08.350
Though, you can't read Bella's thoughts.

01:44:10.890 --> 01:44:12.270
Fascinating.

01:44:15.940 --> 01:44:18.480
I would love to see if...

01:44:18.860 --> 01:44:22.360
you are an exception to my gifts, as well.

01:44:23.950 --> 01:44:26.070
Would you do me the honor?

01:44:47.050 --> 01:44:48.300
Interesting.

01:44:50.430 --> 01:44:52.430
I see nothing.

01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:03.320
I wonder...

01:45:03.940 --> 01:45:07.530
Let us see if
she's immune to all our powers.

01:45:08.450 --> 01:45:09.990
Shall we, Jane?

01:45:11.830 --> 01:45:12.830
No!

01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:14.500
Pain.

01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:30.680
S'£Op!

01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:32.890
Stop! Please! Stop!

01:45:34.310 --> 01:45:37.980
Stop! Just stop hurting him! Please!

01:45:39.100 --> 01:45:40.520
Jane?

01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:43.440
Master?

01:45:47.860 --> 01:45:49.820
Go ahead, my dear.

01:45:55.410 --> 01:45:57.290
This may hurt just a little.

01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:15.600
Remarkable!

01:46:17.480 --> 01:46:20.270
She confounds us all.

01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:24.320
So what do we do with you now?

01:46:24.570 --> 01:46:28.150
You already know
what you're going to do, Aro.

01:46:28.610 --> 01:46:30.450
She knows too much.

01:46:30.820 --> 01:46:33.280
She's a liability.

01:46:36.450 --> 01:46:38.210
That's true.

01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:43.460
Felix?

01:46:47.420 --> 01:46:48.260
No!

01:47:49.820 --> 01:47:50.610
Please!

01:47:50.900 --> 01:47:53.490
No! Please, please!

01:47:55.700 --> 01:47:59.910
Kill me! Not him.

01:48:10.010 --> 01:48:13.130
How extraordinary!

01:48:14.130 --> 01:48:17.010
You would give up your life...

01:48:17.470 --> 01:48:19.680
for someone like us.

01:48:19.770 --> 01:48:21.680
A vampire.

01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:25.230
A soulless monster.

01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:26.980
Just get away from her!

01:48:31.030 --> 01:48:36.070
You don't know a thing about his soul.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.250
This is a sadness.

01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:55.260
If only it were your intention
to give her immortality.

01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:04.770
Wait!

01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:08.730
Bella will be one of us.

01:49:10.070 --> 01:49:11.650
I've seen it.

01:49:13.530 --> 01:49:15.570
I'll change her myself.

01:49:49.270 --> 01:49:51.020
Mesmerizing.

01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:53.730
To see what you have seen...

01:49:54.110 --> 01:49:56.400
before it has happened.

01:49:58.780 --> 01:50:03.990
Your gifts will make for an intriguing...

01:50:04.370 --> 01:50:06.000
immortal.

01:50:06.620 --> 01:50:09.370
IsabeHa.

01:50:13.250 --> 01:50:14.840
Go now.

01:50:15.380 --> 01:50:17.220
Make your preparations.

01:50:18.050 --> 01:50:20.800
Let us be done with this.

01:50:21.850 --> 01:50:24.640
Heidi will arrive any moment.

01:50:26.020 --> 01:50:29.730
Thank you for your visit.

01:50:29.850 --> 01:50:30.980
We will return the favor.

01:50:31.230 --> 01:50:34.320
I would advise that you follow through
on your promise soon.

01:50:34.820 --> 01:50:36.530
We do not offer second chances.

01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:41.660
Goodbye, my young friends.

01:50:47.660 --> 01:50:49.500
Nice fishing, Heidi.

01:50:49.750 --> 01:50:51.920
Yes, they do look ratherjuicy.

01:50:52.040 --> 01:50:53.340
Save some for me.

01:50:54.710 --> 01:50:57.710
This way, please. Stay together.

01:51:12.060 --> 01:51:13.940
Stop it! Stop!

01:51:24.620 --> 01:51:26.370
You're here.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:29.250
You can sleep.

01:51:33.290 --> 01:51:35.210
I'll still be here when you wake up.

01:51:39.630 --> 01:51:40.920
Bella...

01:51:41.130 --> 01:51:43.590
the only reason I left...

01:51:44.390 --> 01:51:46.760
was because I thought
I was protecting you.

01:51:49.060 --> 01:51:51.020
I needed you...

01:51:51.020 --> 01:51:55.560
to have a chance at a normal, happy life.

01:51:58.940 --> 01:52:01.530
It was so easy for you to leave.

01:52:03.990 --> 01:52:07.780
Leaving you was the hardest thing
I've done in 100 years.

01:52:13.870 --> 01:52:15.880
And I swear...

01:52:17.250 --> 01:52:20.460
I will never fail you again.

01:52:22.340 --> 01:52:24.180
I'm so sorry.

01:52:26.260 --> 01:52:27.510
Charlie's coming.

01:52:27.680 --> 01:52:29.010
He)'

01:52:31.140 --> 01:52:32.850
You okay?

01:52:34.230 --> 01:52:35.650
I'm fine.

01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:40.440
Dad, you don't have to worry.

01:52:41.110 --> 01:52:45.490
Last time you said that, you took off.
I didn't see you for 3 days.

01:52:46.990 --> 01:52:49.200
I'm really sorry, Dad.

01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:52.120
Bella...

01:52:52.870 --> 01:52:55.500
do not ever do that to me again.

01:52:57.170 --> 01:52:58.340
Even.

01:53:01.130 --> 01:53:03.220
And you're grounded...

01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:05.510
for the rest of your life.

01:53:06.340 --> 01:53:07.470
Okay.

01:53:17.980 --> 01:53:20.520
We're not technically breaking
any of his rules.

01:53:23.740 --> 01:53:26.990
He did say I couldn't take a step
inside the door.

01:53:27.530 --> 01:53:29.660
I came in through the window.

01:53:33.450 --> 01:53:36.040
He's not gonna forgive me easily.

01:53:38.330 --> 01:53:39.750
I know.

01:53:41.710 --> 01:53:42.920
Can you?

01:53:46.840 --> 01:53:48.840
I hope you can, because...

01:53:49.140 --> 01:53:52.390
I honestly don't know
how to live without you.

01:53:56.940 --> 01:53:57.940
Come here.

01:54:16.080 --> 01:54:17.370
Once...

01:54:17.830 --> 01:54:19.960
Alice changes me...

01:54:21.750 --> 01:54:24.090
you can't get rid of me.

01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:27.470
She won't need to change you.

01:54:28.090 --> 01:54:31.140
There are always ways
to keep the Volturi in the dark.

01:54:33.220 --> 01:54:36.180
No. No.

01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:44.610
You all know what I want.

01:54:46.610 --> 01:54:50.820
And I know how much I'm asking for.

01:54:51.950 --> 01:54:55.450
The only thing I can think of
for it to be fair is...

01:54:55.870 --> 01:54:58.330
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- Shut up.

01:55:00.290 --> 01:55:01.960
Alice?

01:55:02.250 --> 01:55:04.250
I already consider you my sister.

01:55:08.380 --> 01:55:09.170
"Yes."

01:55:09.420 --> 01:55:11.510
- Thank you.
- I vote "yes."

01:55:13.180 --> 01:55:16.260
It would be nice to not want
to kill you all the time.

01:55:19.730 --> 01:55:21.230
I'm sorry.

01:55:22.810 --> 01:55:26.070
I'm really sorry to both of
you for how I acted.

01:55:26.610 --> 01:55:30.360
And I'm really grateful that you were brave
enough to go and save my brother.

01:55:32.490 --> 01:55:36.030
But this isn't a life
I would have chosen for myself.

01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:42.120
And I wish that there'd been someone
to vote "no" for me. So...

01:55:44.750 --> 01:55:46.290
So, "no."

01:55:47.710 --> 01:55:49.840
I vote "hell, yeah."

01:55:51.550 --> 01:55:54.010
And we can pick a fight with
these Volturi some other way.

01:55:54.140 --> 01:55:56.640
I already consider you
a part of the family.

01:55:57.510 --> 01:55:58.850
"Yes."

01:56:04.690 --> 01:56:06.900
Why are you doing this to me?

01:56:08.690 --> 01:56:10.190
You know what this means.

01:56:10.280 --> 01:56:12.200
You've chosen not to live without her.

01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:14.200
Which leaves me no choice.

01:56:14.820 --> 01:56:16.160
I won't lose my son.

01:56:22.830 --> 01:56:27.710
I'll wait until after graduation
to make it easier on Charlie.

01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:35.050
Edward, I want you to be the one to do it.

01:56:41.730 --> 01:56:43.640
He wants to talk to me.

01:56:46.900 --> 01:56:48.610
So you're still alive for now.

01:56:48.900 --> 01:56:50.610
He thinks it's me keeping you away.

01:56:51.150 --> 01:56:53.530
You stay the hell out of my head.

01:56:54.740 --> 01:56:56.200
Jacob...

01:56:57.070 --> 01:56:59.240
I know you have something to say to me.

01:57:00.490 --> 01:57:03.500
But I want to say something to you first,
if that's all right.

01:57:05.540 --> 01:57:07.000
Thank you.

01:57:10.170 --> 01:57:14.090
Thank you for keeping Bella alive
when I didn't.

01:57:14.220 --> 01:57:17.300
No. You didn't.

01:57:18.260 --> 01:57:20.220
And it wasn't for your benefit, trust me.

01:57:21.010 --> 01:57:22.470
I'm still grateful.

01:57:23.430 --> 01:57:27.310
But I'm here now. I'm not gonna
leave her side until she orders me away.

01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:28.940
We'll see.

01:57:31.730 --> 01:57:34.740
Hey, my turn to talk.

01:57:38.370 --> 01:57:41.490
I'm here to remind you
about a key point in the Treaty.

01:57:42.290 --> 01:57:43.750
I haven't forgotten.

01:57:44.200 --> 01:57:45.500
What key point?

01:57:45.830 --> 01:57:48.750
If any of them bites a human...

01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:50.880
the truce is over.

01:57:52.210 --> 01:57:54.090
But if I choose it,
it has nothing to do with you.

01:57:54.340 --> 01:57:56.970
No. No, I won't let you.

01:57:57.590 --> 01:58:00.180
You're not gonna be one of them.

01:58:00.300 --> 01:58:01.970
It's not up to you.

01:58:02.680 --> 01:58:05.430
You know what we'll do to you.
I won't have a choice.

01:58:05.430 --> 01:58:06.890
Bella, please, come.

01:58:07.100 --> 01:58:08.270
Wait.

01:58:10.230 --> 01:58:12.650
Is he gonna hurt me? Read his mind.

01:58:20.240 --> 01:58:21.780
Jake...

01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:29.830
I love you.

01:58:34.250 --> 01:58:35.880
So, please...

01:58:40.430 --> 01:58:42.510
don't make me choose.

01:58:48.440 --> 01:58:49.980
'Cause it'll be him.

01:58:53.480 --> 01:58:55.940
It's always been him.

01:59:02.870 --> 01:59:04.330
Bella...

01:59:12.080 --> 01:59:12.960
Goodbye, Jacob.

01:59:13.250 --> 01:59:14.750
No, you don't speak for her!

01:59:19.970 --> 01:59:21.300
Bella, get out of here.

01:59:23.760 --> 01:59:25.390
S'£Op!

01:59:27.140 --> 01:59:28.270
S'£Op!

01:59:28.810 --> 01:59:31.350
You can't hurt each other
without hurting me.

01:59:50.790 --> 01:59:51.920
Jake.

02:00:06.890 --> 02:00:08.060
He's right.

02:00:09.350 --> 02:00:11.350
You shouldn't become what I am.

02:00:16.730 --> 02:00:18.730
I can't do this alone.

02:00:21.530 --> 02:00:23.490
Please, just wait.

02:00:30.410 --> 02:00:33.620
Just give me 5 years.

02:00:38.630 --> 02:00:40.420
That's too long.

02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:46.260
Then three?

02:00:50.930 --> 02:00:52.890
You're so stubborn.

02:00:54.690 --> 02:00:56.400
What are you waiting for?

02:01:05.490 --> 02:01:09.490
I have one condition...

02:01:10.990 --> 02:01:13.450
if you want me to do it myself.

02:01:17.380 --> 02:01:19.000
What's the condition?

02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:21.500
And then forever.

02:01:23.550 --> 02:01:25.380
That's what I'm asking.

02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:38.770
Marry me, Bella.

02:03:55.990 --> 02:03:59.120
