¢Ü Turn it up! ¢Ü

00:54.638 --> 00:58.141
¢Ü Turn up the radio ¢Ü

00:58.934 --> 01:02.937
¢Ü I need the music
Give me some more ¢Ü

01:03.897 --> 01:05.565
Come on, Boots,
you have three minutes left.

01:05.649 --> 01:08.735
You can do this.
You came to me, remember?

01:08.819 --> 01:10.987
It's not about losing weight.
It's about a lifestyle change.

01:18.370 --> 01:20.496
Nick, you have a customer.

01:21.290 --> 01:22.623
Like we practiced.

01:22.708 --> 01:24.542
Right away, Terry.

01:27.713 --> 01:29.172
'Sup, dawg?

01:30.674 --> 01:32.633
Oh. Ha! Funny.

01:32.718 --> 01:33.843
It's the name of the store.

01:34.011 --> 01:35.136
What can I do for you, man?

01:35.220 --> 01:38.097
Bono has been doing
this for three days.

01:39.433 --> 01:40.641
It's fucking
disgusting.

01:40.726 --> 01:41.726
Bring him up here.

01:41.810 --> 01:43.436
Bono, Bono, come.

01:43.520 --> 01:44.520
Bono, up!

01:44.605 --> 01:46.272
Don't yell at him like that.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.649
Okay. Okay. Cool.
You're gonna...

01:48.734 --> 01:50.568
I might just look...

01:56.909 --> 01:58.409
Do I know you?

01:58.535 --> 01:59.744
I know you.

01:59.828 --> 02:01.746
You're the singer
from Chocolate Lipstick.

02:01.830 --> 02:03.539
You guys used to play
at the Jam Shack on Friday nights.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.041
Damn!
You remember that?

02:05.125 --> 02:06.209
You were so good.
Yeah.

02:06.293 --> 02:07.543
Oh, my God,
you still singing?

02:07.628 --> 02:10.128
Nah. That was
a long time ago.

02:10.214 --> 02:12.465
Wow! What are you
doing now?

02:13.884 --> 02:16.260
You get shit
out of dogs' asses.

02:16.512 --> 02:18.221
That's great.

02:18.555 --> 02:20.181
You own a BMW?

02:20.599 --> 02:22.475
Yeah, can you tell?

02:26.438 --> 02:27.855
Good boy.

02:28.899 --> 02:30.691
<i>Adam, it's Lou.
Don't hang up, okay?</i>

02:30.776 --> 02:32.735
<i>It's not about money.
It's about making money.</i>

02:32.820 --> 02:34.403
<i>You and me, buddy.</i>

02:34.488 --> 02:35.822
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>

02:35.906 --> 02:38.825
<i>So, I did everything according
to your stupid fucking plan.</i>

02:38.909 --> 02:40.660
<i>I took everything
with the yellow stickers</i>

02:40.744 --> 02:43.871
<i>and I left you everything with
the red stickers.</i>

02:45.082 --> 02:47.208
<i>There was some stuff in your closet
with no stickers,</i>

02:47.292 --> 02:49.669
<i>so I threw that in a pile and burned it
in the backyard.</i>

02:50.879 --> 02:52.672
<i>Seemed like the right thing to do.</i>

02:52.756 --> 02:55.007
<i>And thank you for claiming
that empty plastic bottle.</i>

02:55.092 --> 02:57.802
<i>I was prepared to
fight you on that one.</i>

02:58.262 --> 03:00.847
<i>Anyway, I left you
something on the counter.</i>

03:00.931 --> 03:03.599
<i>It's from the heart.</i>

03:05.936 --> 03:08.646
<i>Oh, and one last thing.
Um...</i>

03:08.856 --> 03:12.608
<i>The TV had a red sticker on it,
but I took it anyway.</i>

03:14.319 --> 03:15.611
<i>Bye.</i>

03:16.363 --> 03:18.447
Just keeping
my head down.

03:21.451 --> 03:26.038
Not getting shivved today.
Let's knock these reps out.
Mmm! Mmm!

03:30.043 --> 03:32.962
Turn on a light, Jake.
Open a window.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.756
Go outdoors.
Jesus Christ!

03:35.841 --> 03:37.466
Why don't you get out of the
house this weekend, huh?

03:37.593 --> 03:40.636
What should I do out of the house,
Uncle Adam?

03:40.971 --> 03:43.055
I don't know. Anything
that corresponds with reality.

03:43.140 --> 03:45.558
Apply for a job.
Maybe try to go
to college.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.268
I don't know.
That all sounds kind of overrated.

03:47.352 --> 03:48.895
You don't like it,
you can move back in with your mom.

03:48.979 --> 03:51.022
No, I can't actually.
She moved in with her new boyfriend.

03:51.106 --> 03:52.857
I will not be
anywhere near that.

03:52.941 --> 03:54.025
She moved in with him?

03:54.109 --> 03:55.860
Yeah, the taxidermist.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.863
The taxidermist is
stuffing my mother.

03:58.947 --> 04:00.031
Ugh! Kelly.

04:00.115 --> 04:02.450
She's your sister. You should call her
once in a while. Check in.

04:02.534 --> 04:04.452
Well, maybe she should check in with me.
Ever think of that?

04:04.536 --> 04:05.870
Yeah.
That's interesting.

04:05.954 --> 04:07.622
Listen, I've got a big court date
in a few minutes.

04:07.706 --> 04:09.582
- If I miss it, I'm kind of screwed.
- Why do you waste your time

04:09.666 --> 04:11.042
with that Second Life bullshit?

04:11.126 --> 04:13.294
Look at you, you're still in jail.
You were in jail last week.

04:13.378 --> 04:15.463
Yeah. I'm a prisoner.
It's called "doing hard time."

04:15.547 --> 04:17.130
Can't you be like
a warrior or a shaman

04:17.214 --> 04:18.423
or an Orc or some shit
like that?

04:18.507 --> 04:20.593
No, no. In life,
you make choices,

04:20.677 --> 04:22.428
and if you screw up
you have to pay
for those choices.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.847
You're 20 years old,
you haven't made an important
choice in your life.

04:24.932 --> 04:27.600
What are you mad about?
What is this?

04:28.894 --> 04:30.937
I don't know if you noticed,
but Lily moved out.

04:31.021 --> 04:32.855
Is that what all
the shuffling was?

04:32.940 --> 04:34.023
Uh-huh.

04:34.650 --> 04:36.359
What did you do?

04:37.945 --> 04:39.820
I didn't do anything.

04:57.381 --> 04:59.173
No fucking way!

05:05.222 --> 05:08.265
¢Ü You know I'm a dreamer ¢Ü

05:08.850 --> 05:12.144
¢Ü But my heart's of gold ¢Ü

05:12.229 --> 05:15.356
¢Ü I had to run away high ¢Ü

05:15.440 --> 05:20.444
¢Ü So I wouldn't come home low
Just when things went... ¢Ü

05:25.534 --> 05:29.203
¢Ü ...song And you'll never
be left all alone ¢Ü

05:30.706 --> 05:36.585
¢Ü I'm on my way ¢Ü

05:36.670 --> 05:40.172
¢Ü Home sweet home ¢Ü

05:41.049 --> 05:46.012
¢Ü Tonight, tonight
I'm on my way ¢Ü

05:46.096 --> 05:49.849
¢Ü Home sweet home ¢Ü

05:50.058 --> 05:52.562
<i>Even among the gentle
prairie squirrels,</i>

05:52.572 --> 05:56.397
<i>The mate-less male
is subjected to a humiliating ritual.</i>

05:59.526 --> 06:00.776
Hello.

06:01.778 --> 06:02.987
What?

06:06.366 --> 06:07.658
Fuck!

06:11.079 --> 06:12.496
Hey. Adam.

06:13.415 --> 06:15.332
- What's happening, man?
- Hey.

06:15.417 --> 06:16.792
You all right?

06:18.962 --> 06:20.421
- Hi, Courtney.
- Hey, how you doing?

06:20.505 --> 06:22.173
- Nice to see you.
- You, too.

06:22.257 --> 06:23.883
- Yeah.
- Not here.

06:23.967 --> 06:25.384
Long time.

06:25.469 --> 06:27.261
Yeah. You know...

06:27.971 --> 06:29.805
Work's been crazy and...

06:29.890 --> 06:32.058
- I know.
- I called a couple of times.

06:32.142 --> 06:33.225
Yeah. Yeah.

06:33.977 --> 06:35.436
Very, very busy.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.938
You think this is
a real situation

06:38.023 --> 06:40.691
or just one of his
bullshit episodes?

06:40.776 --> 06:42.276
I don't know.

06:42.486 --> 06:43.694
You never know with Lou.

06:43.779 --> 06:45.905
Well, hey, Adam,
how's your girlfriend?

06:45.989 --> 06:47.573
Oh, really bad.

06:48.033 --> 06:49.283
Okay.

06:51.661 --> 06:52.870
Happy times.

06:52.954 --> 06:55.831
Hi, folks.
I'm Dr. Jeff.
Lou's resting.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.918
He's denying that it was a suicide
attempt and medically he's stable,

06:59.002 --> 07:00.544
so legally we can't
keep him here.

07:00.629 --> 07:02.922
But we do think that he should
be monitored for a few days.

07:03.006 --> 07:04.590
Does he have any family?

07:04.674 --> 07:06.175
Lou's family all
kind of hate him.

07:06.259 --> 07:09.178
Okay. Well, then I guess it's up
to you guys, his friends.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.347
You are his friends, right?

07:13.517 --> 07:14.975
It's like that friend
who's the asshole.

07:15.060 --> 07:16.685
But he's our asshole,
you know?

07:16.770 --> 07:17.978
Right.

07:18.355 --> 07:19.522
Yeah.

07:23.485 --> 07:25.861
<i>Dr. Jefferies to radiology.</i>

07:26.446 --> 07:28.739
Lou.
Why would he do this?

07:29.116 --> 07:31.367
Why? I mean,
make a list.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.410
He's an alcoholic,
he's divorced.

07:33.495 --> 07:35.412
Wife ran off with
that Jamaican guy.

07:35.497 --> 07:38.374
He's failed at every jive-ass
money hustle he's ever tried.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.042
He's in
a mountain of debt.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.168
He hates his mother.

07:41.253 --> 07:42.753
He hates himself.
He hates everybody.

07:42.838 --> 07:44.088
He has erectile dysfunction.

07:44.172 --> 07:45.339
He's got halitosis.

07:45.423 --> 07:46.924
He's got
that runt ball.

07:47.008 --> 07:48.008
Huh.

07:48.093 --> 07:50.553
He said one of his balls
was shriveled up...

07:50.637 --> 07:51.804
Oh, yeah.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.430
...like a spoiled grape.

07:53.515 --> 07:55.891
Wasn't it that
quarterback on the Bears

07:55.976 --> 07:58.060
who had his ball crushed
on the field. Right?

07:58.145 --> 07:59.645
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

07:59.729 --> 08:02.481
- Right, right.
- '82? Yeah, yeah.

08:02.566 --> 08:03.732
He came back
from that, though.

08:03.817 --> 08:04.859
Strong as ever.

08:04.943 --> 08:05.943
Fuck yeah.

08:06.027 --> 08:07.194
But I don't know about Lou.

08:07.279 --> 08:08.821
- It's just like...
- No.

08:08.905 --> 08:11.824
It's just like
an accumulation of punishment.

08:11.908 --> 08:12.908
Fuck you guys.

08:12.993 --> 08:13.993
- Oh!
- Hey!

08:14.077 --> 08:15.995
There he is. Hey.

08:16.079 --> 08:18.581
I can fucking hear everything
you're saying, all right?

08:18.665 --> 08:21.083
Look who's awake.
What's up, man?

08:22.002 --> 08:23.627
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

08:23.920 --> 08:24.920
What's up?

08:25.005 --> 08:27.840
You look just
like my friend Nick.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.009
And you look
like my friend Adam.

08:30.093 --> 08:31.343
But you wouldn't be
those guys because

08:31.428 --> 08:32.595
I've been calling
and calling them,

08:32.679 --> 08:33.679
and they haven't
returned my calls.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.431
So, listen, Violator.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.683
Me and Nick
got a little surprise
for you.

08:38.768 --> 08:41.520
Something special
that the three of us can do.

08:41.605 --> 08:42.897
Come on. You guys.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.273
- Are you curious?
- No!

08:44.357 --> 08:46.692
I didn't fucking try
and kill myself.

08:46.776 --> 08:49.486
If I wanted to kill myself,
I'd fucking kill myself.

08:49.571 --> 08:50.738
I'd be awesome at it.

08:50.822 --> 08:52.531
A shotgun to the dick.

08:53.158 --> 08:54.366
I'm glad you didn't do it.

08:54.451 --> 08:56.869
It's good to see
you guys, anyway.

08:58.997 --> 09:02.041
So, just out of curiosity,
what's the surprise?

09:02.125 --> 09:03.667
Tell him.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.712
Ko-di-ak...

09:07.339 --> 09:08.380
...Valley.

09:08.465 --> 09:09.548
No fucking way!

09:09.633 --> 09:10.633
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.676
Fucking K-Vals?
Holy shit!

09:12.761 --> 09:14.136
Yes, sir. Bang!

09:14.387 --> 09:17.056
We fucking ski, right?
We fucking rage.

09:17.140 --> 09:18.349
Chimney Point
at the end of the night

09:18.433 --> 09:21.936
with a bottle of scotch
to wash it all down. Oh!

09:22.354 --> 09:24.813
And you guys are paying
for the whole thing?

09:25.440 --> 09:26.482
- Sure.
- Yep.

09:26.566 --> 09:27.566
Let's go tonight.

09:27.651 --> 09:28.651
We go tomorrow.

09:28.735 --> 09:29.735
Let's go now.
Let's go now.

09:29.819 --> 09:32.029
I just got to get rid of this thing.
It's really uncomfortable.

09:32.113 --> 09:33.280
You should wait
for the nurse or something.

09:33.365 --> 09:34.782
I got it. I got it.

09:34.866 --> 09:35.866
- Hold on, Lou.
- No, no, no, no.

09:35.951 --> 09:38.369
Let somebody
do that for you.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.379
- Oh, shit.
- God.

09:48.463 --> 09:49.505
Did I get that on you?

09:49.589 --> 09:50.798
- Yes, you did.
- Damn it!

09:50.882 --> 09:53.509
It's only pee.
Relax, it's only pee.

09:58.431 --> 09:59.431
There's Lou.

09:59.516 --> 10:00.808
Good,
he's drinking already.

10:00.892 --> 10:02.351
Look at this shit.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.687
Do you remember when I was 12
and he tried to bite me?

10:04.771 --> 10:07.356
Yeah, but he...
You had that coming.

10:08.149 --> 10:10.025
- Hey, Violator.
- Lou.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.027
What the fuck
is he doing here?

10:12.112 --> 10:13.279
It's nice to
see you, too, Lou.

10:13.363 --> 10:16.031
"Nice to see you, too, Lou."
Fuck you, Jacob.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.950
You suck and you know it.

10:18.034 --> 10:20.286
You just ruined
my fucking weekend.

10:30.046 --> 10:33.299
Hey, Lily will come back.
Trust me.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.467
- No, she won't.
- No, she won't.

10:35.552 --> 10:36.844
- No, she won't.
- No, she won't.

10:36.928 --> 10:38.679
She basically thinks
I'm an asshole, you know?

10:38.763 --> 10:40.681
Like a completely self-absorbed,
delusional...

10:40.765 --> 10:42.433
- She's got a point.
- ...narcissistic.

10:42.517 --> 10:43.976
- Fuck you.
- You're better off.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.228
Take my word for it.
Look at me.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.564
Fuck wives, man.
Fuck kids.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.983
Lock it down or they will take
everything from you.

10:52.861 --> 10:55.571
God damn it!
Who the fuck are you texting with?

10:55.655 --> 10:56.739
Just a friend of mine.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.574
Male or fucking female?

10:58.658 --> 11:01.618
For your information,
I've had a lot of girlfriends.

11:01.703 --> 11:02.703
Hot ones.

11:02.787 --> 11:05.456
You have had lots
of boyfriends. Gay ones.

11:09.878 --> 11:11.837
Hey, hey, hey,
check this out.

11:11.921 --> 11:13.839
I brought a regulation bar
for tubbing tonight.

11:13.923 --> 11:14.965
Nice.

11:15.050 --> 11:18.093
I've got vodka,
fucking Tequilles O'Neals.

11:18.970 --> 11:21.221
You guys are gonna love this.
Check this out.

11:21.306 --> 11:22.473
Chernobly.

11:22.557 --> 11:23.932
It's like
the Russian Red Bull.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.559
It's got shit in it
that's not even legal here.

11:25.643 --> 11:27.061
Like what shit?

11:27.312 --> 11:28.854
How the fuck am I
supposed to know, dude?

11:28.938 --> 11:30.606
But it's illegal.

11:30.690 --> 11:31.940
Hey, why didn't we
just go to Pinnacle?

11:32.025 --> 11:33.567
It would have taken,
like, half the time.

11:33.651 --> 11:35.569
You wanna go
to Kodiak Valley,
trust me.

11:35.653 --> 11:36.904
You're at
the right age for it.

11:36.988 --> 11:38.238
Really?

11:38.323 --> 11:41.241
Yeah. Nobody gets carded
and everybody gets laid.

11:41.701 --> 11:45.871
- K-Val! K-Val! K-Val!
- K-Val! K-Val! K-Val!

11:45.955 --> 11:47.664
Oh, shit! K-Val!

11:53.004 --> 11:55.422
This? This is
the coolest town ever?

11:56.549 --> 11:58.300
Fuck!
That used to be Papa Enzo's.

11:59.844 --> 12:02.096
I broke up with
Jenny Stedmeyer there.

12:02.180 --> 12:03.430
What made you break
up with her, again?

12:03.515 --> 12:05.974
I don't know.
We swapped virginities junior year.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.684
All we did was
listen to records and have sex.

12:07.769 --> 12:10.396
And she was epic, I mean she was...
She was epic.

12:10.480 --> 12:11.563
Yeah, man.
She was hot.

12:11.648 --> 12:13.482
And then when I broke up
with her, she was so mad,

12:13.566 --> 12:15.818
she practically stabbed me
in the eye with a fork.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.945
Actually, she did stab me
in the eye with a fork.

12:18.029 --> 12:19.196
She was a one-percenter, man.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.280
Yeah.

12:20.365 --> 12:21.698
All downhill from there.

12:22.325 --> 12:24.952
That was a big one.
First love.

12:25.036 --> 12:26.286
The one that got away.

12:26.371 --> 12:28.330
The great white buffalo.

12:28.415 --> 12:29.581
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:29.666 --> 12:31.166
The great what?

12:31.251 --> 12:33.043
Great white buffalo.

12:33.128 --> 12:35.129
Why are you guys
whispering?

12:35.213 --> 12:37.131
Great white buffalo.

12:37.215 --> 12:39.842
That was really helpful,
you guys. Thank you.

12:46.975 --> 12:48.642
Look at this place.

12:48.726 --> 12:50.436
I'm gonna make
a prediction right now.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.146
One of us is gonna
start writing a novel,

12:52.230 --> 12:53.772
and then we all
get snowed in,

12:53.857 --> 12:56.358
and then Lou's gonna
ax murder all of us.

13:01.239 --> 13:02.781
Motherfuck.

13:02.866 --> 13:04.408
What's that smell?

13:04.492 --> 13:05.451
Fucking cats.

13:06.661 --> 13:09.496
Kind of a lot of cats.
This sucks.

13:09.706 --> 13:10.873
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.749
You got a reservation

13:12.834 --> 13:14.585
For Webber-Agnew?

13:14.669 --> 13:16.128
Sorry. What was that
name again?

13:16.212 --> 13:18.755
Webber-Agnew.
Webber and Agnew.

13:19.382 --> 13:20.757
I got a "Nick Webber-Agnew."

13:20.842 --> 13:23.469
I'm sorry, excuse me. What?
What did you just say?

13:23.553 --> 13:24.595
Webber-Agnew?

13:24.679 --> 13:26.889
Webber-fucking-Agnew?

13:27.474 --> 13:29.975
You took your wife's last name?
You're a fucking hyphenate?

13:30.059 --> 13:32.227
A lot of dudes are doing it.
It's progressive.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.979
No. No dudes
are doing it.

13:34.063 --> 13:35.731
You look like a progressive guy.
Is that progressive?

13:35.815 --> 13:37.399
- Would you do that? No.
- No.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.026
And he has a goatee.

13:42.906 --> 13:44.490
Does this guy seem a little
imbalanced to you?

13:44.574 --> 13:45.574
No. Come on.

13:45.658 --> 13:46.909
He's right there.
Shut up.

13:48.870 --> 13:50.370
Let me give you
a hand with that.

13:50.455 --> 13:51.622
Hey!

13:51.706 --> 13:54.416
I am not going
to tell you again!

13:57.420 --> 13:58.962
I can handle it.

13:59.714 --> 14:01.173
This guy's
a fucking dick.

14:01.257 --> 14:03.383
- Shh. He's disabled.
- He can hear you.

14:03.468 --> 14:05.594
So what? He's exempt from
common fucking courtesy

14:05.678 --> 14:07.095
'cause he can't start
a round of applause?

14:08.598 --> 14:10.098
He's gotta jerk
off one-handed?

14:10.183 --> 14:12.226
I mean, I certainly
don't take my hands

14:12.310 --> 14:13.977
and I put them together
and oil them up...

14:14.062 --> 14:17.022
Hey, 420. Our old room.
Check it out.

14:18.775 --> 14:19.983
- That's okay man.
- Oh! Those are mine.

14:20.068 --> 14:21.735
I'll just get those.

14:28.660 --> 14:32.621
This is the part where you tip
the guy that helped you out.

14:32.914 --> 14:35.332
I'm not the guy that...

14:35.416 --> 14:36.583
Nick, pay the man
something.

14:36.668 --> 14:37.876
I got it.
Don't worry.

14:37.961 --> 14:39.127
This place
looks like shit!

14:39.212 --> 14:41.338
What happened
to that guy?

14:41.839 --> 14:44.508
Check this shit out.
It's still there.

14:44.842 --> 14:47.135
Adam sucks cocks 'n' dicks.

14:47.804 --> 14:49.346
It's your best work.

14:49.430 --> 14:50.806
Fucking burned you.

14:51.766 --> 14:52.724
Burned!

14:52.809 --> 14:53.892
Hey, guys,
come take a look at this.

14:53.977 --> 14:55.894
We got a hot tub.

14:57.981 --> 14:59.773
- Sweet Jesus!
- Poor little fella.

14:59.857 --> 15:01.984
This is obviously
unacceptable, right?

15:02.068 --> 15:04.820
We call downstairs,
get somebody to fix this?

15:04.904 --> 15:06.029
Is anybody else hungry?

15:08.616 --> 15:10.492
A little school spirit
this time, huh?

15:10.618 --> 15:12.452
- We're in, man.
- Just play it like you fucking mean it.

15:12.537 --> 15:14.371
- Like that.
- Yeah.

15:15.498 --> 15:19.376
Yes, I would like to get a hooker
to fuck me and my friends.

15:20.128 --> 15:22.296
What? Adam,
I'm not doing that.

15:22.380 --> 15:23.547
Whatever, semantics.

15:23.631 --> 15:27.593
I want an escort to escort
our penises into her vagina.

15:28.803 --> 15:30.887
I want the girl
in the picture, too.

15:30.972 --> 15:33.265
- No tomfoolery.
- Wake her up, I don't care.

15:33.349 --> 15:34.558
Will you listen to him?

15:34.642 --> 15:35.809
Does she do four?

15:35.893 --> 15:37.603
What about three?

15:37.687 --> 15:39.271
- Okay. Jacob, you're out.
- Okay. Good.

15:39.355 --> 15:40.939
I need $3,000.

15:41.024 --> 15:42.024
I'm not in.
I'm married.

15:42.108 --> 15:45.360
- Adam, I need $2,000. Me and you, buddy.
- Come on.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.570
I'm out there, Violator.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.113
Can I call you back, sir?

15:48.197 --> 15:50.282
- Okay. Thank you. Bye.
- Sir?

15:50.366 --> 15:52.743
Let's do something fun.
Let's create a memory, huh?

15:52.827 --> 15:55.412
Let's get some cocaine
and break into a school.

15:55.496 --> 15:58.123
Or steal a cop car
or some shit, huh?

15:58.207 --> 15:59.791
- Do you have Ritalin?
- No.

15:59.876 --> 16:03.712
Don't fucking lie to me.
Every one of you people have Ritalin.

16:03.796 --> 16:04.838
No, I don't.

16:04.922 --> 16:06.506
I'm sorry.
You probably do have Ritalin.

16:06.591 --> 16:07.924
I have some Ativan,
but it's different.

16:08.009 --> 16:09.509
- Let's stick it up our asses.
- Just give it to him.

16:09.594 --> 16:11.011
No. It's not
a suppository.

16:11.095 --> 16:13.805
It doesn't matter.
You crush it, you put it
in a warm paper towel,

16:13.890 --> 16:16.475
run it under warm some water and you
stick it right up your ass. That works.

16:16.559 --> 16:17.934
You put the paper towel
up your ass, too?

16:18.061 --> 16:19.394
- You crush up the...
- Hey, I got an idea,

16:19.437 --> 16:20.854
- why don't we just play quarters?
- What?

16:20.938 --> 16:23.649
I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna do.
I'm getting really sad.

16:23.733 --> 16:25.150
You know what
I'm talking about?

16:25.234 --> 16:27.486
I'm gonna go to the bathroom and
be alone with my own thoughts.

16:27.570 --> 16:28.987
Who knows what's
gonna happen up there.

16:29.072 --> 16:30.072
Who knows
what's gonna happen.

16:30.156 --> 16:31.698
You better plan
something fun.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.160
Jesus!

16:35.620 --> 16:37.371
Pussies.
I'm going dancing.

16:37.455 --> 16:39.790
I don't know, man.
Maybe coming here was a bad idea.

16:39.874 --> 16:43.669
Yeah.
If he kills himself,
can we go home?

16:43.753 --> 16:45.087
Hard to believe
this is the very room

16:45.171 --> 16:47.589
we had some of
the best weekends of our lives.

16:47.674 --> 16:50.050
Really?
In this room right here?

16:51.260 --> 16:52.594
How?

16:52.679 --> 16:55.889
We were young. We had momentum.
We were winning.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.017
We were best friends.

16:59.102 --> 17:00.519
What do you mean,
"were" best friends?

17:00.603 --> 17:03.355
You know what I mean, man.
Everybody seemed to care more.

17:03.439 --> 17:05.857
Everything seemed
to matter more back then.

17:05.942 --> 17:07.233
Whatever.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.664
Check it out.
They must have fixed it.

17:21.582 --> 17:22.915
Come on!

17:23.751 --> 17:25.544
- How's the water, Violator?
- Oh, man.

17:25.627 --> 17:28.630
You guys gotta get in here.
It's gonna fucking change you.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.257
Wait, why are you naked?

17:30.341 --> 17:31.383
You're all getting naked?

17:31.467 --> 17:32.676
Yep.

17:32.760 --> 17:33.802
You don't think
it's a little weird,

17:33.886 --> 17:35.053
a bunch of guys
just piling up

17:35.138 --> 17:36.388
in a big bathtub
together, naked?

17:36.472 --> 17:38.765
Are you afraid
that some of these
people might see you?

17:38.850 --> 17:40.225
I'm sorry.
If I'm being honest,

17:40.309 --> 17:43.603
I'm not totally comfortable being around
a bunch of other naked dudes.

17:43.688 --> 17:45.188
It's called
male bonding, okay?

17:45.273 --> 17:47.524
Haven't you even
seen Wild Hogs?

17:47.608 --> 17:48.984
<i>Fine, get us some snacks.</i>

17:49.068 --> 17:50.694
You know what? Fuck it.

17:51.821 --> 17:53.530
I'm leaving
my underwear on.

17:53.614 --> 17:55.449
Yeah. Yeah. Very nice.
Shut up!

17:57.994 --> 18:00.245
Damn, it's good to be here
with you all again, man.

18:00.371 --> 18:02.289
- It's good to be back here with you guys.
- Yep.

18:02.373 --> 18:03.915
I want to toast
to the good times.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.960
And you, too, young blood.
Come on in, here.

18:08.504 --> 18:09.713
Yeah!

18:11.424 --> 18:13.175
¢Ü This style seems wild ¢Ü

18:13.259 --> 18:15.093
¢Ü Wait before you treat me
like a stepchild ¢Ü

18:15.178 --> 18:16.970
¢Ü Let me tell you why
they got me on file ¢Ü

18:17.054 --> 18:18.430
¢Ü 'Cause I give you
what you lack ¢Ü

18:18.514 --> 18:21.433
¢Ü Come right and exact
I stand accused of doing harm ¢Ü

18:21.517 --> 18:22.934
¢Ü 'Cause I'm louder than a bomb ¢Ü

18:23.019 --> 18:25.812
¢Ü Come on
Come on, louder ¢Ü

18:25.897 --> 18:27.272
¢Ü Come on
Come on ¢Ü

18:27.356 --> 18:28.857
- Go, Violator!
- I'm gonna throw up.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.942
Snap out of it!
Out the tub! Out the tub!

18:31.027 --> 18:32.486
I'm good. I'm good.
I'm good.

18:33.696 --> 18:37.199
¢Ü I am a rock hard trooper
To the bone, the bone, the bone ¢Ü

18:37.283 --> 18:39.576
¢Ü Full grown
Consider me stone ¢Ü

18:39.660 --> 18:41.953
¢Ü Once again and
I say it for you to know ¢Ü

18:42.038 --> 18:44.039
¢Ü The troop is always ready
I yell "Geronimo" ¢Ü

18:44.123 --> 18:46.166
¢Ü Your CIA,
you see I ain't kiddin' ¢Ü

18:46.250 --> 18:48.293
¢Ü Both King and X They got rid of both ¢Ü

18:51.506 --> 18:53.715
¢Ü And not the braggin'
or boastin' and plus ¢Ü

18:53.800 --> 18:55.342
¢Ü It ain't no secret why
they're tappin' my phone ¢Ü

18:55.426 --> 18:57.135
¢Ü Although I can't keep it a secret ¢Ü

18:57.220 --> 18:58.887
¢Ü So I decided to kick it, yo ¢Ü

18:58.971 --> 19:00.096
¢Ü And yes it weighs a ton ¢Ü

19:00.181 --> 19:01.139
¢Ü I say it once again ¢Ü

19:01.224 --> 19:03.099
¢Ü Tappin' my phone
They never leave me alone ¢Ü

19:04.560 --> 19:06.561
¢Ü 'Cause I'm louder than a bomb ¢Ü

19:23.871 --> 19:25.747
Hey, little buddy.

19:34.674 --> 19:35.799
Dude.

19:38.553 --> 19:40.637
Where did the squirrel go?

19:42.181 --> 19:44.015
Yeah. Yeah!

19:44.600 --> 19:45.934
- This is the black diamond?
- Shit.

19:45.977 --> 19:47.227
- Terrifying.
- That's all you got?

19:47.353 --> 19:49.187
- I don't remember this.
- What do you think, boys?

19:49.313 --> 19:50.355
Tips down.

19:50.439 --> 19:52.440
Tips fucking down,
right away.

19:52.567 --> 19:53.900
Let's ride.

20:06.414 --> 20:08.290
I feel 19 again!

20:11.961 --> 20:13.587
What is that?

20:14.088 --> 20:15.213
Stop it, Lou.

20:15.298 --> 20:16.882
Stop it, Lou!

20:19.218 --> 20:20.302
Whoo!

20:22.305 --> 20:23.263
Coming through!

20:23.347 --> 20:24.890
You goddamn kids!

20:29.896 --> 20:31.104
- Slow down!
- Hey!

20:31.188 --> 20:33.523
Yard sale, bitches!

20:56.297 --> 20:57.464
Fuck!

21:00.676 --> 21:01.760
We dead.

21:01.844 --> 21:04.429
Are you guys alive?
Holy fuck.

21:05.014 --> 21:08.975
By all counts we should be
pretty fucked up right now, but I...

21:09.352 --> 21:10.435
I kind of feel great.

21:10.519 --> 21:11.895
I feel crazy right now.

21:11.979 --> 21:13.563
I feel fantastic!

21:13.648 --> 21:16.316
I wanna fuck something!

21:20.321 --> 21:21.613
There they are.

21:21.697 --> 21:23.114
I see it, Chaz. Thanks.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.743
What is that
one plank thing
that guy's got?

21:26.827 --> 21:29.496
I don't care.
It's going up his ass.

21:31.749 --> 21:33.667
Way to go, rookie!

21:34.335 --> 21:35.794
Wow! Nice.

21:36.379 --> 21:37.921
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa...

21:39.882 --> 21:42.717
Those are the kind of ski shenanigans
I don't allow on my mountain.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.719
Yeah. Come on, guys.

21:45.513 --> 21:47.055
What are you
looking at, Nancy?

21:47.139 --> 21:48.723
No. I mean...

21:49.558 --> 21:53.228
<i>Hey, look, it's the douche bag
from Karate Kid III.</i>

21:57.108 --> 21:58.775
I know that guy.

22:21.132 --> 22:22.215
Hey, guys.

22:22.299 --> 22:24.884
Is there some kind of weird retro
thing going on this weekend?

22:24.969 --> 22:26.261
Can't get any bars.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.763
Morty!
Yeah, it's Chuck.

22:28.848 --> 22:31.016
You're never gonna
believe where I'm calling you from, man.

22:31.100 --> 22:34.269
I'm on a mountain
on my phone! Yeah.

22:35.062 --> 22:37.981
Yeah, well, a bet's a bet.
I want my $2.

22:43.404 --> 22:45.822
I'm telling you,
something weird is going on.

22:45.906 --> 22:47.907
<i>Demand your MTV.</i>

22:48.701 --> 22:50.869
<i>I want my MTV.</i>

22:52.747 --> 22:58.710
¢Ü S-A-F-E-T-Y ¢Ü

22:58.961 --> 23:01.629
¢Ü Safe, dance! ¢Ü

23:06.343 --> 23:08.136
I love your hair.

23:10.264 --> 23:11.765
<i>I have a question.</i>

23:11.849 --> 23:13.933
<i>...can still
tell me that's true.</i>

23:14.018 --> 23:17.353
<i>But the facts and the evidence
tell me it is...</i>

23:27.198 --> 23:28.740
Dude is rocking
a cassette player.

23:28.824 --> 23:30.700
Just relax.
I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation

23:30.826 --> 23:32.118
- for all this shit.
- Don't fucking tell me to relax.

23:32.203 --> 23:33.536
I said relax
for a minute.

23:33.621 --> 23:35.038
Leg warmers?

23:35.289 --> 23:36.664
Jheri curl?

23:36.749 --> 23:38.124
"Where's the beef?"

23:38.209 --> 23:41.336
Excuse me, miss,
what color is Michael Jackson?

23:42.004 --> 23:43.254
Black.

23:48.219 --> 23:50.720
Hold on! Sorry.
Excuse me. Sorry.

23:52.389 --> 23:53.389
Nick, come on, man!
Nick! Nick!

23:54.558 --> 23:55.642
Who the fuck is that?

23:55.726 --> 23:56.976
That's probably
Ashton Kolchak right now

23:57.061 --> 23:59.145
telling us we've been
punked or whatever.

23:59.230 --> 24:01.022
- Okay.
- Come on. Come on.

24:05.319 --> 24:07.779
Hey. Hey, guys.
I've got your luggage.

24:08.322 --> 24:10.532
He's got both arms.
Get him!

24:14.578 --> 24:16.454
- What?
- Check his arm.

24:16.539 --> 24:18.581
- Are you raping?
- Wait! Hold on! Are we raping him?

24:18.666 --> 24:19.833
Nobody's raping anybody!

24:19.917 --> 24:21.626
Where's your missing arm,
motherfucker?

24:21.710 --> 24:24.003
Hey! God!
That's my arm!

24:24.088 --> 24:25.588
- It's fake!
- It's real!

24:25.673 --> 24:28.174
It's got freckles on it
and shit!

24:36.934 --> 24:38.810
Do I really got to be
the asshole that says

24:38.894 --> 24:41.396
we got in this thing
and went back in time?

24:41.480 --> 24:44.732
It must be some kind of
hot tub time machine.

24:47.736 --> 24:49.195
Wow, my old stuff.

24:49.280 --> 24:50.655
Look at this shit, man.

24:50.739 --> 24:51.823
You have a bong?

24:51.907 --> 24:52.991
I did.

24:53.075 --> 24:55.326
"Eddie Lives."
This shirt got me so much fucking pussy.

24:55.411 --> 24:56.578
You wanna see
what got a lot of pussy?

24:56.662 --> 24:57.745
What's the tape recorder for?

24:57.830 --> 24:58.955
- Recording tape.
- I gotta take a piss.

24:59.081 --> 25:00.498
- This jacket right here, baby.
- Holy fuck!

25:00.583 --> 25:01.875
What are you,
Hunter S. Thompson?

25:01.959 --> 25:03.960
- I thought I was.
- Is that coke?

25:04.044 --> 25:05.962
What the fuck you think it is?
Baby powder?

25:06.046 --> 25:07.130
Wait. How is this happening?

25:07.214 --> 25:10.175
Can we talk about this
for a minute?

25:14.096 --> 25:17.473
Holy fuck! Winterfest '86.
We were here, man.

25:17.558 --> 25:18.933
- Guys.
- We are here.

25:19.018 --> 25:20.101
What if we run into ourselves?

25:20.186 --> 25:21.227
Guys!

25:21.312 --> 25:24.522
We see ourselves and we blow up
and explode or some shit.

25:24.607 --> 25:25.690
Get in here!

25:25.774 --> 25:26.941
Didn't you all fucking see Timecop?

25:27.026 --> 25:28.943
God damn it!
Get the fuck in here right now!

25:29.028 --> 25:30.904
Nobody wants to see
your giant shit, Lou.

25:30.988 --> 25:32.447
What, man?

25:43.876 --> 25:46.419
Yeah, we're not gonna
run into ourselves.

25:46.503 --> 25:47.629
We are ourselves.

25:47.713 --> 25:50.340
Why are we in our young bodies
and you in your regular body?

25:50.424 --> 25:51.382
I don't know.

25:51.467 --> 25:52.634
Shouldn't you be invisible?

25:52.718 --> 25:54.302
Or swimming around
some guy's ball sack?

25:54.386 --> 25:57.555
I know.
Because you guys exist here and I don't.

25:58.724 --> 26:00.725
Hey, why are you flickering?

26:00.809 --> 26:02.227
- What?
- What? What? Who flickered?

26:02.311 --> 26:04.103
- He did.
- He's flickering.

26:04.188 --> 26:05.563
I need you to touch
my arm or something

26:05.648 --> 26:06.731
to see if I'm
still real, okay?

26:06.815 --> 26:09.817
Just see if you can put
your hand through me.

26:12.363 --> 26:13.529
Okay.

26:13.948 --> 26:15.198
That's good.

26:15.282 --> 26:19.035
I'm physically still here.
That's good, I think.

26:20.746 --> 26:22.330
You look like Kid 'N Play.

26:22.414 --> 26:24.540
That's actually two people.

26:27.169 --> 26:28.878
I knew this trip
was a bad idea.

26:28.963 --> 26:31.422
Every time I hang out with you,
man, it's some kind of shit storm.

26:31.507 --> 26:33.049
I got guilted into
coming on this trip

26:33.133 --> 26:34.592
and now I'm back
in the fucking '80s.

26:34.677 --> 26:35.760
And I hate this decade!

26:35.844 --> 26:37.262
Maybe it's your
fucking fault!

26:37.346 --> 26:40.014
You're a fucking insurance salesman,
you're practically the devil.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.308
Guys! This is
scientifically possible.

26:42.393 --> 26:45.853
Oh, my God. Okay, Professor Hawking,
tell me in your robot voice

26:45.938 --> 26:47.605
how this is
scientifically possible.

26:47.690 --> 26:49.399
<i>All right,
I write Stargate fan fiction,</i>

26:49.483 --> 26:51.317
so I think I know
what I'm talking about right now.

26:51.402 --> 26:53.987
I seriously almost passed out,
you're such a dork.

26:54.071 --> 26:56.739
Okay. The tub is obviously
some kind of energy vortex, right?

26:56.824 --> 26:57.865
Like a black hole.

26:57.950 --> 27:00.034
But, instead of
being in space,

27:01.078 --> 27:02.745
it's in a hot tub.

27:02.830 --> 27:05.748
Time is not linear,
we just perceive it that way!

27:05.874 --> 27:07.583
<i>- What?
- Like The Terminator!</i>

27:07.668 --> 27:09.627
It's cyclical, right?

27:09.712 --> 27:12.338
The machines send Schwarzenegger
back to kill Sarah Connor

27:12.423 --> 27:14.299
so that John Connor
could never be born.

27:14.383 --> 27:17.218
But if John Connor don't send
Michael Biehn back to protect her,

27:17.303 --> 27:21.556
then they never fuck, and John Connor
ain't born in the first place!

27:22.057 --> 27:23.641
- It checks out.
- Yeah, that's pretty good.

27:23.726 --> 27:26.311
Wait, wait, check the fucking drawer.
See if the carving's there.

27:26.395 --> 27:28.563
Check the fucking drawer.

27:29.481 --> 27:30.898
Fuck!

27:33.193 --> 27:34.193
It's gone.

27:35.404 --> 27:36.446
This shit is real.

27:36.530 --> 27:38.740
The carving you
made 20 years ago,

27:38.824 --> 27:40.742
about me sucking
cocks and dicks,

27:41.910 --> 27:43.911
- it's not there.
- Wait.

27:44.538 --> 27:45.705
Is "cocks" still there?

27:45.789 --> 27:47.248
Nothing.
I mean, it's not there.

27:47.333 --> 27:48.416
What about "dicks"?

27:48.500 --> 27:51.127
Neither "cocks,"
nor "dicks," nor "sucks."

27:51.211 --> 27:52.754
Oh, God!

27:53.255 --> 27:56.632
That's it.
We stuck in the fucking '80s!

27:57.176 --> 27:59.552
How am I supposed
to get a job?

28:00.095 --> 28:01.721
I'm so scared.

28:03.474 --> 28:05.183
Looks like you
burned out your...

28:05.267 --> 28:08.019
Heck, you fried
your timing crossover.

28:09.855 --> 28:11.064
Would you mind
putting that down, sir,

28:11.148 --> 28:14.275
that coal shovel,
before somebody gets hurt?

28:15.319 --> 28:16.819
Did somebody call you?

28:16.904 --> 28:18.362
Excuse me one minute.

28:23.827 --> 28:25.495
Who ever calls us?

28:26.663 --> 28:29.582
And who answers when the call comes
from within? Huh?

28:31.126 --> 28:35.505
I thought maybe I could pull the part
from one of the other tubs.

28:35.589 --> 28:39.050
But it turns out this is
a very special model that you have here.

28:39.134 --> 28:41.427
You've got to be
very careful, I tell you.

28:41.512 --> 28:46.265
One little thing is changed,
the whole system can go haywire.

28:46.350 --> 28:48.309
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

28:48.393 --> 28:50.520
The whole system
can go haywire

28:50.604 --> 28:52.855
if you change
one little thing.

28:53.273 --> 28:56.192
Wait a minute.
We need that to get back in time?

28:56.276 --> 28:57.318
Well, you're back here.

28:57.402 --> 29:01.114
I mean, I can tell you've all been
to Kodiak Valley before.

29:01.198 --> 29:02.657
- I haven't.
- Maybe not her,

29:02.741 --> 29:05.243
but I know that
you were here.

29:05.327 --> 29:07.870
You know what's
going on here, don't you, old man?

29:07.955 --> 29:09.163
Yes, I do.

29:09.248 --> 29:12.083
Your tub is on the fritz.
It'd behoove you to fix it.

29:13.293 --> 29:14.502
What?

29:14.628 --> 29:16.170
It's working.

29:19.675 --> 29:21.551
Damn.
I think it's still broke.

29:21.635 --> 29:22.718
Shit.

29:24.221 --> 29:25.263
Where'd he go?

29:25.347 --> 29:27.140
That motherfucker's
in on it, man.

29:27.224 --> 29:28.891
What was all that
cryptic shit he was saying

29:28.976 --> 29:30.101
about not changing
one little thing?

29:30.185 --> 29:32.603
I know exactly what he meant.
He was talking about the butterfly effect.

29:32.688 --> 29:34.105
That was
a great fucking movie.

29:34.189 --> 29:36.649
One little change
has a ripple effect

29:36.733 --> 29:38.109
and it affects
everything else.

29:38.193 --> 29:40.111
Like, a butterfly
floats its wings

29:40.195 --> 29:43.781
and Tokyo explodes, or there's
a tsunami in, like, somewhere.

29:43.866 --> 29:45.867
Dude, yes, exactly.
Or you step on a bug

29:45.951 --> 29:47.910
and the fucking
Internet's never invented.

29:47.995 --> 29:50.454
Then you have to talk
to girls with your mouth.

29:50.539 --> 29:52.957
Yeah. I was more concerned
about bigger consequences,

29:53.041 --> 29:54.292
like me not being born.

29:54.376 --> 29:55.793
Oh, yeah.
No, I don't care about that.

29:55.878 --> 29:58.296
The point is,
what did we do 20 years ago?

29:58.380 --> 29:59.630
Let's figure it
out right now.

29:59.715 --> 30:02.508
We gotta do
the exact same thing.

30:02.593 --> 30:04.302
- I had that gig.
- That's right.

30:04.386 --> 30:07.555
You got up on stage
and you were wildly mediocre.

30:07.639 --> 30:08.973
And that led to
nothing of a career.

30:09.057 --> 30:11.601
Okay, first of all,
fuck you, motherfucker!

30:11.685 --> 30:14.812
I could have had a career,
but I got married and I went a different way.

30:14.938 --> 30:16.314
Which way is that?
The way that sucked?

30:16.398 --> 30:17.773
Didn't you also
bang that groupie?

30:17.858 --> 30:19.525
- What was her name?
- Tara.

30:19.610 --> 30:22.320
You banged her.
You got to go do that again.

30:22.404 --> 30:25.740
I did do that.
But, fuck, no, I'm married!

30:26.074 --> 30:27.617
I can't go around
banging girls in hot tubs.

30:27.701 --> 30:31.078
Nick, it's 1986. You can't cheat
on someone you don't know yet.

30:31.163 --> 30:33.414
You haven't
even met Courtney.

30:33.498 --> 30:35.666
Lucifer,
itinerary please.

30:35.751 --> 30:36.751
Uh... Nothing
really happened.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.628
I actually fucked a chick, too.
So I'll just do that.

30:38.712 --> 30:40.922
I seem to remember
you getting your ass whooped.

30:42.132 --> 30:43.674
- Oh, yeah.
- That's right.

30:43.759 --> 30:46.594
That ski patrol dude
pummeled you like it was his job.

30:46.678 --> 30:47.762
Yeah, no.
I don't remember it that way.

30:47.846 --> 30:48.888
I do.

30:48.972 --> 30:51.474
Yeah. He fucked you up.
You cried and peed.

30:51.558 --> 30:54.518
Fuck this, man!
This is fucking bullshit!

30:54.603 --> 30:56.604
Would you just think of somebody
other than yourself, man?

30:56.730 --> 30:57.730
There's four of us.

30:57.814 --> 30:59.732
It's the fucking '80s, guys!

30:59.816 --> 31:02.526
Let's do what we wanna do.
Free love!

31:02.611 --> 31:04.278
That's
the '60s, dipshit.

31:04.363 --> 31:06.322
No, we had, like,
Reagan and AIDS.

31:06.406 --> 31:08.282
Let's get the fuck
out of here, okay?

31:08.367 --> 31:09.700
Do the right thing, Violator.

31:09.785 --> 31:12.620
God damn it!
This is fucking bullshit!

31:12.704 --> 31:14.705
Tonight's the night
you broke up with Jenny Stedmeyer.

31:14.790 --> 31:15.998
- Shit.
- Yeah, you got stabbed

31:16.083 --> 31:18.042
in the fucking
eyeball tonight!

31:18.627 --> 31:20.795
Hey, man,
do you want backup?

31:20.879 --> 31:22.338
I can't, the butterflies
won't let me.

31:22.464 --> 31:23.839
Yo, Adam?
You guys in there?

31:23.924 --> 31:25.132
Oh, shit.

31:28.011 --> 31:30.096
There you are. Hey!

31:30.180 --> 31:32.682
How come you guys didn't meet us at
the chair lift this morning?

31:32.766 --> 31:33.891
You were going to
show me some moves.

31:33.976 --> 31:36.435
Hi, baby.
I missed you.

31:38.939 --> 31:40.523
I must have forgot.

31:40.607 --> 31:42.650
Perv. That's from Mandy.

31:43.026 --> 31:44.527
- Hey, new guy. What's up?
- Hey.

31:44.611 --> 31:46.988
So we're in 214.
I'm gonna go get ready.

31:47.072 --> 31:48.364
- Okay.
- Meet me in my room, okay?

31:48.448 --> 31:49.865
- Okay.
- Okay.

31:50.158 --> 31:52.076
Love the PJs, Nick.
You look hot.

31:54.121 --> 31:55.997
Poison's tonight.

31:56.081 --> 31:57.206
Wow!

31:57.291 --> 31:59.083
I don't remember her
being that fucking beautiful.

31:59.167 --> 32:02.753
And tight.
She's so tight.

32:02.838 --> 32:03.921
She's really
fucking tight!

32:04.006 --> 32:05.339
She's the great
white buffalo, man.

32:05.424 --> 32:06.674
- Great white buffalo.
- Great white buffalo.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.384
Don't start that.

32:08.468 --> 32:09.927
- Great white buffalo.
- Great white buffalo.

32:10.012 --> 32:10.970
Why did I ever break up with her?

32:11.054 --> 32:12.096
Why would I
break up with her?

32:12.180 --> 32:13.180
Doesn't matter.
Doesn't matter.

32:13.265 --> 32:14.932
'Cause you have to
do it again. Right?

32:15.017 --> 32:16.642
Right, right, right.

32:16.727 --> 32:18.019
All right. We're
all gonna meet back here.

32:18.103 --> 32:20.187
Hopefully that hot tub's fixed
and we can get the fuck out of here.

32:20.272 --> 32:21.772
Okay, let's party
like it's 1986.

32:21.857 --> 32:22.982
All right. On three?

32:23.066 --> 32:24.066
- One, two, three...
- One, two, three...

32:24.151 --> 32:25.901
- Hot tub time machine!
- Wait...

32:25.986 --> 32:26.986
What are we...
What's the...

32:27.070 --> 32:28.070
Who said,
"Hot tub time machine?"

32:28.155 --> 32:29.322
We didn't tell you
about the new thing, with our hands?

32:29.406 --> 32:30.906
- No.
- On three, we always...

32:30.991 --> 32:32.283
From now on,
we're gonna say, "Hot tub time machine."

32:32.367 --> 32:33.617
I told you, I think
that's fucking stupid.

32:33.702 --> 32:34.702
You were in
the bathroom.

32:34.786 --> 32:35.786
No, but this is a real
bonding event for us.

32:35.871 --> 32:36.871
This doesn't happen
all the time.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.331
- Come on.
- I'm telling you, it's stupid.

32:38.415 --> 32:39.623
- Do it once.
- Do what you want to do.

32:39.708 --> 32:40.916
It would have been
3-to-1 anyway.

32:41.001 --> 32:42.293
One, two, three...

32:42.377 --> 32:43.461
...hot tub time machine!

32:43.545 --> 32:44.712
It felt good. Admit it.

32:55.682 --> 32:56.891
Hey!

32:58.352 --> 33:00.644
Let's get
this party started!

33:01.271 --> 33:03.397
Who is carrying
me home tonight?

33:03.857 --> 33:04.899
Mom?

33:04.983 --> 33:06.442
Sweet fucking Lord.

33:06.526 --> 33:07.610
Kelly.

33:07.694 --> 33:08.819
Hey, bro, Nicholas.

33:08.904 --> 33:09.945
Hey, girl.

33:10.030 --> 33:11.030
Who's the geek?

33:11.114 --> 33:12.156
He's your son.

33:13.283 --> 33:14.950
That's not appropriate.

33:15.035 --> 33:16.410
I'm sun...
Sunshine.

33:16.495 --> 33:17.536
Sunshine.

33:17.621 --> 33:18.662
'Cause I'm here to
brighten your day.

33:18.747 --> 33:21.082
That's Jacob.
Your...

33:21.416 --> 33:22.708
He's totally cool.

33:22.793 --> 33:23.793
He doesn't look cool.

33:23.877 --> 33:26.837
He's not that cool.
Hey, Kelly.

33:26.922 --> 33:28.881
Lou Dorchen. Yeah...

33:28.965 --> 33:30.007
You don't remember this?

33:30.092 --> 33:31.050
I don't remember everything.

33:31.134 --> 33:33.094
What the fuck, man?
This is freaking me the fuck out.

33:33.178 --> 33:34.637
You freak out every time
you leave the basement.

33:34.721 --> 33:35.888
All right, kiddies,
get your snow boots on

33:35.972 --> 33:38.265
because tonight
there is gonna be a blizzard.

33:38.350 --> 33:40.017
Really? It looked
pretty clear out.

33:40.102 --> 33:42.311
Anybody wanna go
for a little sleigh ride?

33:42.396 --> 33:45.898
You can't do cocaine!
It's so unhealthy for you.

33:45.982 --> 33:47.191
Kelly, in public?

33:47.275 --> 33:48.317
Whatever.

33:48.402 --> 33:50.027
I'm gonna go to a party
at the ski patrol house,

33:50.112 --> 33:51.570
I'm gonna find
a sexy instructor

33:51.655 --> 33:54.115
and I'm gonna wax
his fucking pole.

33:54.199 --> 33:56.617
Later, homos.
Don't drink my fucking drink.

33:56.701 --> 33:57.785
Ugh!

33:59.079 --> 34:00.037
Hey, Adam?

34:00.122 --> 34:03.499
What she means is that she works
at the ski rental place, right?

34:03.583 --> 34:05.751
And that's her job,
is cleaning the poles.

34:05.836 --> 34:08.337
I could be off, but I think
it's in reference to blowing a dude.

34:08.422 --> 34:11.382
Thank you, Nick.
But that's... You don't need to...

34:11.466 --> 34:12.882
Or fucking a dude.
Because the wax,

34:12.967 --> 34:15.136
it can be interpreted
either way.

34:15.219 --> 34:17.554
She was a free spirit,
you know?

34:17.639 --> 34:21.475
Or maybe she's the pole and there's
two dudes that she's waxing.

34:21.560 --> 34:24.186
Let's justget it done, man.
Come on.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.063
- Hey, Lou.
- What?

34:26.148 --> 34:29.065
Did my mom, like,
sleep with a bunch of dudes?

34:29.150 --> 34:30.150
I don't know.
Shut up.

34:30.235 --> 34:31.610
But she seems
kind of slutty, right?

34:31.695 --> 34:33.987
Does she seem
that way to you?

34:34.072 --> 34:35.906
It's just, she never
told me who my dad is.

34:35.991 --> 34:37.408
It could be any
one of these guys.

34:37.492 --> 34:39.534
'Cause I was born, like,
nine months from now.

34:39.619 --> 34:41.203
Yeah?
So what does
that mean?

34:41.288 --> 34:42.580
It means do the math,
dipshit.

34:42.664 --> 34:44.706
I could have been
conceived this weekend.

34:44.833 --> 34:46.500
Oh, shit.
Check this out.

34:46.585 --> 34:49.587
That's that fucking bellhop.
I hate that guy.

34:50.839 --> 34:53.507
This must be where
he loses the arm!

34:56.636 --> 34:58.387
- Shit!
- Thank you!

34:58.472 --> 35:00.181
I think
we should tell him.
This is gruesome.

35:00.265 --> 35:01.265
Don't you dare
fucking tell him.

35:01.349 --> 35:04.185
You'll screw
the time thing up.

35:16.740 --> 35:17.781
Yeah!

35:18.909 --> 35:19.909
Yes!

35:19.993 --> 35:21.035
What the fuck?

35:21.870 --> 35:23.037
Yeah!

35:24.414 --> 35:27.708
Boo! We just got fucking robbed.

35:27.792 --> 35:28.918
What are you talking about?

35:29.002 --> 35:30.169
- He's great, man.
- Come on!

35:31.046 --> 35:32.296
Jenny.

35:33.798 --> 35:34.798
Jenny?

35:34.883 --> 35:36.717
I'm in the bathroom.
Come in.

35:37.677 --> 35:39.220
What do you think?

35:39.304 --> 35:40.804
Oh, my God.

35:40.889 --> 35:42.765
What? Do I look fat?

35:43.558 --> 35:46.060
No. You look
really beautiful.

35:47.687 --> 35:50.314
Aw! Thank you.

35:53.193 --> 35:54.652
How about me,
do I look different?

35:54.736 --> 35:56.403
Do I look kind of older?

35:57.113 --> 35:58.280
No.

35:59.199 --> 36:01.075
You look cute, though.

36:01.409 --> 36:03.160
God, I can't stop
thinking about last night.

36:03.245 --> 36:05.454
It was like frigging hot.

36:05.539 --> 36:08.374
It was? What did we do?
I don't remember.

36:08.708 --> 36:11.544
You lasted,
like, 10 minutes.

36:11.836 --> 36:13.003
Oh!

36:13.171 --> 36:14.588
Good, good.

36:15.006 --> 36:16.173
And I was good.

36:16.258 --> 36:20.344
I think I came. I think.
I can't even tell you what it was like.

36:20.428 --> 36:23.138
I got some vague
recollection of that.

36:23.765 --> 36:25.349
Wanna maybe just sit
and talk for a minute?

36:25.433 --> 36:26.725
"Talk."

36:26.810 --> 36:30.854
Well, I mean, you know,
it's just so good to see you again.

36:34.818 --> 36:36.777
It's not you. It's me.

36:41.616 --> 36:42.866
Lamp.

36:43.451 --> 36:46.078
You know what,
I think we should go to Poison now.

36:46.162 --> 36:47.371
You're weird today.

36:47.455 --> 36:49.206
I know.
You are funny.

36:49.291 --> 36:50.249
Let me just get dressed.

36:50.333 --> 36:51.875
Okay.

36:53.420 --> 36:54.420
Wow!

36:58.717 --> 37:00.009
Oh, man!

37:00.552 --> 37:02.052
This is trippy.

37:02.137 --> 37:03.721
What's up?

37:03.972 --> 37:07.600
Man, I can't even remember
the last time I saw you guys.

37:08.351 --> 37:09.727
Yesterday.

37:10.562 --> 37:12.730
Oh, yeah. Yesterday.

37:15.442 --> 37:16.525
Yep.

37:21.656 --> 37:25.159
It's not cheating.It's not cheating.
It's 1986.

37:25.285 --> 37:26.702
You don't even
know Courtney yet.

37:28.997 --> 37:30.581
You know, it's okay
if you're scared, Lou.

37:30.665 --> 37:33.167
I'm not scared, idiot.
I'm fucking pissed.

37:33.251 --> 37:34.918
I have a full head of hair
and a functioning penis,

37:35.003 --> 37:37.171
and I'm looking for some guy
to drill me in the fucking jaw.

37:37.255 --> 37:38.756
We're not gonna
find him here, anyway.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.132
I don't even remember
what he looks like.

37:44.846 --> 37:46.430
- Walk much, faggot?
- Sorry.

37:46.514 --> 37:48.098
What? No, don't touch me.
The fuck, you're sorry.

37:48.183 --> 37:50.142
You scuffed up my Jordans.

37:51.186 --> 37:54.563
You wanna go for it?
Come on, take a shot, pussy. Wanna party?

37:54.648 --> 37:56.523
Wanna be a hero?

37:56.691 --> 37:58.817
And here it comes.

38:02.572 --> 38:05.991
Yeah, you gonna cry?
You gonna cry, titty baby?

38:06.076 --> 38:09.620
You gonna fucking cry?
Look at him he's crying.

38:09.704 --> 38:11.914
Your fucking bag
is mine now.

38:12.666 --> 38:14.041
Is that it?

38:14.250 --> 38:15.668
No.

38:15.752 --> 38:17.503
No, I yell back at him

38:17.587 --> 38:19.421
and I challenge him to
a rematch at midnight saying,

38:19.506 --> 38:20.881
"You bring your friends
and I'll bring mine."

38:20.965 --> 38:22.424
And my friends
don't fucking show up.

38:22.509 --> 38:24.677
So I get pummeled
by six guys instead of one.

38:24.761 --> 38:27.388
All right, fantastic.
Let's do this.

38:29.224 --> 38:31.392
Lou, come on.
You have to.

38:33.728 --> 38:35.229
Hey, Blaine.

38:35.897 --> 38:38.440
Is that all you got?
Pussy.

38:41.694 --> 38:44.238
Oh, God. Yeah.

38:45.365 --> 38:47.991
I'll never go back.
I'll never go back.

38:50.161 --> 38:51.745
Are you crying?

38:52.247 --> 38:53.414
No.

38:53.498 --> 38:55.916
It's the water splashing my face
from all the fucking.

38:56.584 --> 38:57.751
Okay, good.

38:58.128 --> 39:01.422
Because I thought
you were crying, and I was like...

39:01.714 --> 39:02.840
Yeah!

39:02.924 --> 39:04.425
I'm sorry, Courtney.

39:04.509 --> 39:06.301
- It's Tara.
- Courtney!

39:06.386 --> 39:07.344
Tara. Tara.

39:07.429 --> 39:08.846
Courtney! Courtney!

39:08.930 --> 39:11.348
No, seriously,
my name is Tara.

39:11.599 --> 39:13.767
No, my wife, my wife.

39:15.103 --> 39:16.103
You're married?

39:16.271 --> 39:18.647
No, I'm not married.
Not now, anyway.

39:18.731 --> 39:21.400
I will be.
She's nine right now.

39:27.031 --> 39:30.117
Can I tell you something
that I haven't told anybody?

39:30.618 --> 39:32.244
She cheated on me.

39:33.955 --> 39:35.706
I found a e-mail.

39:36.291 --> 39:38.208
And now every time
I look at her,

39:38.293 --> 39:40.377
all I can see is
her getting rammed by

39:40.462 --> 39:43.714
some faceless dude
with a better body and a bigger dick.

39:43.798 --> 39:46.216
Truth of it is, I can't even
bring myself to say anything

39:46.301 --> 39:48.969
because I just love
her so fucking much.

39:50.305 --> 39:53.223
I don't even know if I can
live without her cheating ass.

39:53.308 --> 39:54.892
Hey, what's an e-mail?

39:54.976 --> 39:56.727
That's not the point!

39:57.479 --> 40:00.564
Seems like you might've took one
defensive swing against him.

40:00.648 --> 40:03.734
I mean, honestly, what the fuck, man?
That was...

40:03.818 --> 40:07.070
I don't know how you've
lived with yourself all these years.

40:07.155 --> 40:08.739
It was pathetic.

40:08.823 --> 40:11.408
It was pathetic.
You couldn't have kicked him from the ground?

40:11.493 --> 40:12.993
What happened?

40:16.080 --> 40:17.164
Uh...

40:17.749 --> 40:20.584
This is a crazy story.
I got hit by a truck.

40:21.085 --> 40:22.669
Yeah, yeah.

40:22.754 --> 40:25.297
Trying to save a baby deer,
if you can believe that.

40:25.381 --> 40:26.465
Oh, my God!

40:26.549 --> 40:28.842
Is there anything
that I can do?
Are you okay?

40:30.720 --> 40:33.805
Oh, my God.
No, I'm fine. This is nothing.

40:33.890 --> 40:36.266
You know what? Come with me.
I'm gonna take care of you.

40:36.351 --> 40:37.684
And bring your friend.

40:37.769 --> 40:38.852
No, we can't.

40:38.895 --> 40:40.604
- We'd love to, but we can't.
- We can, we can.

40:40.688 --> 40:42.564
We should probably go check
on that deer, actually.

40:42.649 --> 40:43.690
No, we can go.
We can go.

40:45.568 --> 40:47.778
¢Ü I know you cannot wait ¢Ü

40:47.862 --> 40:49.905
¢Ü Wait to see me, too ¢Ü

40:49.989 --> 40:51.198
Oh, my God!

40:51.282 --> 40:53.450
This is like
the best song ever!

40:53.535 --> 40:54.701
Maybe not ever.

40:56.246 --> 40:57.913
¢Ü At the drive-in ¢Ü

40:57.997 --> 40:59.623
God, he's so hot!

40:59.707 --> 41:01.959
¢ÜIn the old man's Ford ¢Ü

41:02.043 --> 41:04.503
¢Ü Behind the bushes ¢Ü

41:04.671 --> 41:06.129
Can I get 3,000 beers?

41:06.214 --> 41:08.173
¢Ü Until I'm screaming for more ¢Ü

41:08.258 --> 41:10.384
¢Ü Down the basement ¢Ü

41:12.220 --> 41:14.304
Who's next?
Who's next for the beer luge?

41:14.389 --> 41:16.640
This guy! This guy's next!
He wants it so bad.

41:16.724 --> 41:17.724
You can do it, man.

41:17.809 --> 41:18.976
He wants it.

41:21.729 --> 41:24.356
Luge! Luge! Luge!
Luge! Luge! Luge!

41:28.111 --> 41:32.281
That was so lame. That wasn't, like,
even violent a little bit.

41:32.365 --> 41:34.157
Who are you, and why did you
do that to me?

41:34.242 --> 41:37.202
Why? Because you looked
like you needed a luge.

41:37.287 --> 41:39.329
- I'm Adam.
- I'm April.

41:39.414 --> 41:40.414
How are you doing?

41:40.498 --> 41:41.665
All right.

41:41.749 --> 41:43.333
What brings you here?

41:43.418 --> 41:44.459
Hot tub.

41:44.544 --> 41:45.544
Huh.

41:45.628 --> 41:47.379
- You?
- Poison.

41:47.964 --> 41:49.756
- Right.
- That band. Poison.

41:49.924 --> 41:52.968
<i>I'm a journalist.
I'm covering the band for Spin magazine.</i>

41:53.052 --> 41:54.511
You don't really look
like you're the type.

41:54.596 --> 41:57.514
The Poison type?
God, no. I'm not. I'm really not.

41:57.599 --> 41:59.683
I basically just
got onto this bus

41:59.767 --> 42:03.729
and it took me here,
to goddamn Winterfest.

42:03.980 --> 42:05.439
Adam!

42:06.149 --> 42:07.274
Whoo!

42:07.734 --> 42:09.484
You know what?
I can't talk to you.

42:09.569 --> 42:10.652
You can't?

42:10.737 --> 42:12.404
But I'm awesome.
I can guarantee that.

42:12.488 --> 42:15.157
I'm sure. You see, I have to walk
in the exact same footsteps.

42:15.241 --> 42:17.034
This didn't happen.

42:17.118 --> 42:18.744
Well, it kind of happened.

42:18.828 --> 42:19.870
I wish it did.

42:19.954 --> 42:21.538
- I just saw it happen.
- It really didn't.

42:21.623 --> 42:23.415
Yeah. No, I contributed.

42:23.499 --> 42:24.666
I wish it did.

42:24.751 --> 42:25.834
All right.

42:26.461 --> 42:27.461
See you.

42:32.550 --> 42:36.094
I brought you some ice.
It'll make you feel better.

42:36.262 --> 42:37.846
Let's see that.

42:38.473 --> 42:39.473
Feel better?

42:39.557 --> 42:41.600
That ice does make me feel better.

42:43.728 --> 42:45.228
Butterflies.

42:45.313 --> 42:48.148
Hey, you know what?
I just remembered I gotta meet a guy.

42:48.232 --> 42:49.399
No, no. Wait.

42:50.693 --> 42:52.653
No, you can't go.

42:52.820 --> 42:54.488
'Cause guess what?

42:54.572 --> 42:55.614
What?

42:55.698 --> 42:57.658
I only do two at a time.

42:58.451 --> 42:59.451
What do you mean?

42:59.535 --> 43:00.952
What do I mean?

43:04.499 --> 43:06.291
There those are.

43:06.584 --> 43:08.251
Yeah, let's do this.

43:08.336 --> 43:09.920
Him first? Okay.

43:10.004 --> 43:11.463
It's your thing.
I don't wanna tell you what to do.

43:12.674 --> 43:14.549
Hold on,
I gotta get the phone.

43:15.760 --> 43:18.679
Hello? Mom?

43:19.013 --> 43:20.013
What?

43:20.098 --> 43:21.223
I wanna know what
the doctor said.

43:21.307 --> 43:23.684
Lou? Lou,
we can't do this.

43:23.768 --> 43:24.935
Yes, we can.

43:25.019 --> 43:26.311
No, this didn't happen.

43:26.396 --> 43:27.396
- We can't do this.
- Yes, we can.

43:27.522 --> 43:29.106
- This didn't happen in the past.
- Yes, it did. Shut up.

43:29.190 --> 43:31.024
This did not fucking
happen in the past.

43:31.109 --> 43:32.901
You shut the fuck up,
please.

43:32.985 --> 43:34.611
We're gonna make, like,
Hitler president or something.

43:34.696 --> 43:36.279
We can't do this.

43:36.364 --> 43:40.033
Look, can you be
fucking normal? Please?

43:40.118 --> 43:42.119
Every young man's fantasy
is to have a three-way.

43:42.245 --> 43:44.287
- Not with another fucking guy.
- It's still a three-way.

43:44.372 --> 43:46.039
What about the policy
of the butterfly effect?

43:46.124 --> 43:48.750
The butterfly effect
can suck my nuts!

43:49.711 --> 43:52.629
Look, we're gonna have sex
with this girl, okay?

43:52.797 --> 43:54.798
You, me, together.

43:55.550 --> 43:57.759
Enough of this queer shit.
Let's get the mood right.

43:59.053 --> 44:00.137
All right.
Look, right there.

44:00.221 --> 44:01.221
What?

44:01.305 --> 44:03.932
You don't wanna seem overzealous
with a full-on rager.

44:04.016 --> 44:05.976
You don't want
to insult the woman, either.

44:06.060 --> 44:08.937
You're gonna wanna get at least
a half-a-chub going, right?

44:09.021 --> 44:10.397
- Look at me.
- No.

44:10.481 --> 44:11.732
- Look at that.
- No.

44:11.816 --> 44:13.817
Look at how, like,
perfect that is.

44:13.901 --> 44:15.902
I'm not gonna
fucking look.

44:16.821 --> 44:17.863
Look, look. Here.

44:17.947 --> 44:18.989
What the fuck, man?

44:20.241 --> 44:21.908
- I'm out of here.
- Come on, Jake,

44:22.034 --> 44:23.702
- I was just getting you started.
- Don't care!

44:23.786 --> 44:24.786
Guys do that.

44:24.871 --> 44:26.580
No one does that!

44:26.831 --> 44:28.415
Hey. Onesies?

44:31.252 --> 44:32.502
Sorry.

44:33.004 --> 44:34.254
Okay, cool.
I'm out of here.

44:41.763 --> 44:42.888
Hey.

44:42.972 --> 44:44.973
How did it go
with Jenny?

44:46.309 --> 44:47.476
Oh, my God.

44:49.103 --> 44:52.898
Oh, my God. Whoo!
Why aren't you dancing?

44:53.566 --> 44:54.900
Whoa! What's your name?

44:54.984 --> 44:56.943
That's Jacob.
That's Jenny.

44:58.571 --> 45:00.113
What the fuck are you doing?

45:00.156 --> 45:01.615
- You're supposed to break up with her!
- I know.

45:01.699 --> 45:03.200
No, no, no.
Just check it out, okay?

45:03.284 --> 45:05.160
Maybe she's
the key to something.

45:05.244 --> 45:07.746
And I messed it up
when I broke up with her before,

45:07.830 --> 45:10.123
and now the universe
is giving me another crack at it.

45:10.208 --> 45:13.001
And if you thought
you could really start over

45:13.085 --> 45:14.586
and do something
totally different,

45:14.670 --> 45:16.254
you wouldn't
even consider it?

45:16.339 --> 45:17.672
You're absolutely right.

45:17.757 --> 45:18.715
You think so? Really?

45:18.800 --> 45:19.966
No. Fuck, no!

45:20.051 --> 45:21.301
Come on!

45:23.846 --> 45:25.096
What do you mean,
you didn't do it?

45:25.181 --> 45:26.640
I'm getting to it.

45:26.724 --> 45:28.808
No, we were supposed to do
everything that we did.

45:28.893 --> 45:29.893
That's what I remember.

45:29.977 --> 45:31.394
Yeah, Adam,
what the fuck, man?

45:31.479 --> 45:32.604
You were supposed
to fucking dump her.

45:32.688 --> 45:35.148
You think I liked getting my ass fucked
up and down the entire street?

45:35.274 --> 45:36.650
- Because I didn't.
- It's not that I'm not gonna do it,

45:36.734 --> 45:38.485
I just haven't done it yet.
There's a big difference.

45:38.569 --> 45:39.736
Look at my face, dude.

45:39.820 --> 45:41.488
Look at my fucking face!
Drink me in.

45:41.572 --> 45:42.989
You think I wouldn't have liked
to have changed this?

45:43.074 --> 45:46.409
Shut the fuck up, Lou.
You tried to rope me into a three-way.

45:46.494 --> 45:47.536
- What?
- Did you?

45:47.620 --> 45:48.745
- No.
- Yes.

45:48.829 --> 45:50.163
Lou! Did you?

45:50.248 --> 45:53.416
I didn't fuck that girl.
Okay?

45:53.584 --> 45:56.628
Because I'm committed
to not changing the past.

45:56.837 --> 45:58.046
Right. It had nothing to do with her

45:58.130 --> 45:59.673
wanting to be a Chinese finger trap.

45:59.757 --> 46:01.716
And I'm not saying that
because she was Asian.

46:01.801 --> 46:04.177
So you're telling me
I cheated on my wife for no reason.

46:05.346 --> 46:06.388
Just relax, okay?

46:06.472 --> 46:08.014
I'm gonna do it.
I just haven't done it yet!

46:08.099 --> 46:09.099
You're unbelievable.

46:09.183 --> 46:10.934
- Hey, Nick, can I ask you a question?
- Yes.

46:11.018 --> 46:12.811
Does this seem like
it's all about Adam again?

46:12.895 --> 46:15.188
Yeah, just like
Cincinnati.

46:15.856 --> 46:17.524
- What?
- You gonna bring that up?

46:17.608 --> 46:19.901
We said we weren't gonna talk
about Cincinnati ever, okay?

46:19.986 --> 46:22.779
Is this why you have that shoebox
in your closet that says "Cincinnati"?

46:22.863 --> 46:23.863
Yeah.

46:23.948 --> 46:25.031
What?
That's fucking admissible!

46:25.116 --> 46:26.700
You keep it
in the closet?

46:26.784 --> 46:29.160
What was I supposed to do with it?
You can't bury those things.

46:29.245 --> 46:30.870
And you wrote
"Cincinnati" on it?

46:30.955 --> 46:33.873
How do I know which one
it's supposed to be?

46:34.208 --> 46:35.250
Is it a fetus?

46:35.334 --> 46:36.710
My friends
are ridiculous.

46:36.794 --> 46:38.128
Why are we still
talking about this?

46:38.212 --> 46:40.088
Okay, we said
we would never talk about that.

46:40.172 --> 46:43.466
By the way, where does it say
in the fucking friendship handbook

46:43.551 --> 46:47.095
that you are the only one
who is allowed any fucking problems?

46:47.179 --> 46:49.264
I forgot that it says
in the asshole handbook

46:49.348 --> 46:52.100
that you can just
fuck over your friends
whenever you want!

46:52.184 --> 46:53.810
Actually, it would say that
in the asshole handbook

46:53.894 --> 46:55.312
if it was, like,
guidelines for being an asshole,

46:55.396 --> 46:56.855
- that's what it would say.
- Why wouldn't it say that

46:56.939 --> 46:58.064
- in the asshole handbook?
- Yeah, it would say

46:58.149 --> 46:59.316
- to fuck your friends.
- "Fuck over your friends."

46:59.400 --> 47:00.692
- No, no, no.
- Have you ever read a book?

47:00.776 --> 47:04.029
You're right. I'm sorry, my bad.
You guys are right.

47:04.196 --> 47:06.489
But if you're changing
the fucking past, okay,

47:06.574 --> 47:08.908
then I'm changing
the fucking past, all right?

47:08.993 --> 47:10.452
No! Lou!

47:10.536 --> 47:13.038
Okay! We're in the game!
I like this.

47:13.122 --> 47:14.873
I didn't change anything yet,
I just didn't do it.

47:14.957 --> 47:16.124
And if we're
changing shit,

47:16.208 --> 47:18.126
you better be there at midnight
to get my fucking back.

47:18.210 --> 47:19.586
- Done.
- I'll be there.

47:19.670 --> 47:22.088
Guys! Guys! Come on, man.
Talk to me about this!

47:22.173 --> 47:23.673
- Fuck off.
- Fuck!

47:23.758 --> 47:25.050
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Where are you going?

47:25.134 --> 47:26.217
I gotta go.
I'm getting out of here.

47:26.302 --> 47:28.011
No, no, Adam,
listen to me, please.

47:28.095 --> 47:30.513
Jenny Stedmeyer is not
your fucking destiny, okay?

47:30.598 --> 47:31.723
She's just some girl.

47:31.807 --> 47:33.850
Some girl you dated
in high school, okay?

47:33.934 --> 47:35.518
I know! I just got some emotions coming up.

47:35.603 --> 47:36.936
I got some feelings
that I got to deal with.

47:37.021 --> 47:39.022
I'm gonna do it.
I believe in you.
You're awesome.

47:39.106 --> 47:40.690
You know what? That's fine.
Everybody just take off!

47:40.775 --> 47:41.983
I don't need to be born.

47:42.068 --> 47:45.278
I'll just go find the repairman myself
and fix the time machine.

47:46.280 --> 47:48.657
That's the dumbest thing
I've said in a while.

47:50.993 --> 47:52.535
You made the best
decision of your life,

47:52.620 --> 47:54.037
choosing me as
your friend over Adam.

47:54.121 --> 47:55.580
I'm pretty sure
that's not
what's going on here.

47:55.665 --> 47:57.624
Don't be afraid.
I'm gonna treat you right.

47:57.958 --> 47:59.501
- Daddy's gonna take care of you.
- Whoa!

47:59.627 --> 48:00.669
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!

48:00.753 --> 48:03.338
Here we go. It's like
a slow-motion guillotine.

48:05.132 --> 48:07.300
What the F-ing fuck?

48:15.643 --> 48:18.144
Here we go.
Here we go. Round two.

48:19.897 --> 48:20.897
Should we help him?

48:20.981 --> 48:22.273
No. No.
This is his destiny.

48:29.699 --> 48:30.740
Fuck you!

48:30.825 --> 48:32.617
- Did it happen?
- No.

48:35.996 --> 48:37.330
If that guy doesn't
lose his arm soon,

48:37.415 --> 48:39.582
I'm gonna fucking
take it from him myself.

48:39.750 --> 48:40.750
Man!

48:45.381 --> 48:46.840
Blaine!

48:47.007 --> 48:49.092
Come on down, man.
Have a brewski with us.

48:49.176 --> 48:50.218
There's a party.

48:50.302 --> 48:53.304
"No foreign army has ever
occupied American soil.

48:53.389 --> 48:54.848
"Until now."

48:55.224 --> 48:56.683
Watching Red Dawn again, or...

48:56.851 --> 48:58.643
<i>Wolverines!</i>

48:59.520 --> 49:00.937
They're Ruskies.

49:01.021 --> 49:02.939
<i>And these are their secret
Commie weapons.</i>

49:03.023 --> 49:04.441
What are you
talking about?

49:04.525 --> 49:06.234
Look at this stuff, man.

49:06.318 --> 49:09.237
They could be
spies or something.

49:09.405 --> 49:11.114
I don't know, Blaine.
I mean, they seem a little young

49:11.198 --> 49:12.615
to be spies, you know.

49:12.700 --> 49:13.867
Come on, Chaz.

49:14.702 --> 49:17.495
They could be
some kind of 21 Jump Street

49:17.663 --> 49:19.998
spy battalion-type dudes.

49:21.917 --> 49:25.211
Yeah. Yeah. Or not at all, you know?
There's also that.

49:25.671 --> 49:27.088
What the fuck is this?

49:28.257 --> 49:29.299
There's something
I wanna talk to you about.

49:29.383 --> 49:31.718
It's something I'm supposed to do
but I don't wanna do.

49:31.802 --> 49:32.969
- You know why?
- Okay, Adam. But...

49:33.053 --> 49:36.473
Because I was thinking
about how good we are together, right?

49:36.599 --> 49:38.808
- Don't you think? I really think so.
- Okay.

49:38.893 --> 49:40.935
And I was talking about the future
and I was thinking about,

49:41.020 --> 49:43.146
well, my future is this way
and maybe it could be this way.

49:43.230 --> 49:45.315
I know I'm rambling now.
God, you're so beautiful.

49:45.399 --> 49:46.816
But we got along
so great and...

49:46.901 --> 49:48.526
What is that?

49:49.028 --> 49:51.571
It's a note I wrote to you.
You should read it.

49:51.864 --> 49:53.907
- Right now? Okay.
- Yeah.

49:53.991 --> 49:57.494
"Dear Adam, you're a super-terrific guy
and I love you.

49:57.620 --> 49:58.745
Aw!

49:59.163 --> 50:00.455
"And that's why
this is so hard for me.

50:00.539 --> 50:03.958
"You're one of the most
amazing people that I've ever met. I can't..."

50:04.126 --> 50:07.545
Are you breaking up with me?
That's what this... This is a break-up note?

50:07.922 --> 50:09.172
I'm sorry, Adam.

50:09.256 --> 50:11.674
All these years!
You stabbed me in the eye with a fucking fork

50:11.759 --> 50:13.510
and you were gonna
break up with me anyway?

50:13.594 --> 50:14.677
Is that what
you're saying to me?

50:14.762 --> 50:15.804
I did what?

50:15.888 --> 50:18.723
Why are you breaking up with me?
That's not how this works.

50:19.391 --> 50:21.851
You're such a great guy
and you're gonna find the right girl,

50:21.936 --> 50:23.144
but it's not me.

50:23.229 --> 50:26.898
And everybody knows what a big deal
you're gonna be some day.

50:27.942 --> 50:31.277
No, I'm not.
I'm not. I'm not anybody.

50:31.445 --> 50:35.114
Adam, okay.
It's not you, it's me.

50:36.951 --> 50:39.577
I say that to you.
You don't say that to me.

50:39.662 --> 50:41.538
That's not how this works.

50:41.622 --> 50:44.624
Do you know what happens to you
if we don't go back?

50:45.251 --> 50:46.292
You end up with
Billy Lavatino.

50:46.377 --> 50:47.377
I like him.

50:47.461 --> 50:50.380
You may like him, but then you
end up pregnant with, like, trucker hips,

50:50.464 --> 50:52.173
and you have a baby
with Billy Lavatino,

50:52.258 --> 50:54.133
and you're addicted
to Weight Watchers, you little bitch.

50:54.260 --> 50:56.010
- What did you just call me?
- Take this fucking back!

50:56.095 --> 50:58.429
Don't you... Jesus!

51:01.600 --> 51:03.017
I don't get fat!

51:03.978 --> 51:04.978
Gross!

51:09.233 --> 51:12.151
If we're changing shit,
we gotta be taking advantage of shit.

51:12.319 --> 51:14.320
- No.
- Mulligan.

51:14.822 --> 51:16.155
- No mulligan.
- Come on!

51:16.240 --> 51:17.782
- You had, like, five mulligans.
- Dude.

51:17.950 --> 51:20.076
I'm not talking
about bad stuff,
either, okay?

51:20.160 --> 51:21.202
I'm just talking
about good stuff.

51:21.287 --> 51:24.914
Like keeping Manimal on the air,
you know?

51:24.999 --> 51:26.207
Or preventing
Miley Cyrus.

51:26.292 --> 51:27.917
Preventing her
from what?

51:28.002 --> 51:29.210
Just preventing her.

51:29.295 --> 51:32.088
<i>And there's the catch!
First down!</i>

51:37.344 --> 51:38.761
Oh, shit!

51:39.430 --> 51:40.638
I know this game.

51:40.723 --> 51:41.848
Yeah?

51:41.932 --> 51:43.766
Yeah. This is the Denver-Cleveland
playoff game.

51:43.934 --> 51:45.518
This is the fucking Drive, man.

51:45.603 --> 51:46.686
Yeah?

51:48.689 --> 51:50.189
I know what
we're gonna do.

51:56.864 --> 51:59.532
Adam, hey. You're back. Awesome.

51:59.992 --> 52:02.243
What's going on here?
Where are the guys?

52:03.370 --> 52:04.871
- What's this?
- Read it.

52:05.039 --> 52:07.665
"Dear Adam, you are
a super-terrific guy and I love you,

52:07.750 --> 52:11.461
"which is why this is so hard for me.
I cherish our friendship."

52:13.380 --> 52:14.964
She broke up with you?

52:15.132 --> 52:17.508
And you still fucking got stabbed
in the eye?

52:17.885 --> 52:19.552
Leave me alone.
Get out of here.

52:19.762 --> 52:21.596
What are you doing here?
You writing poetry?

52:21.680 --> 52:23.556
Just leave me alone
and get out of here. No.

52:23.641 --> 52:25.308
You're writing
fucking break-up poetry.

52:25.392 --> 52:27.727
All right, I'm writing
break-up poetry, okay?

52:28.729 --> 52:30.188
Because my heart hurts.

52:30.397 --> 52:31.439
She stabbed me in
my heart and my eye.

52:31.523 --> 52:32.523
Holy shit, you're wasted.

52:32.608 --> 52:35.944
Look, I've had
like two wine kills,
Captain Buzzcooler.

52:36.028 --> 52:37.695
- God.
- You're fucked up.

52:39.031 --> 52:41.824
"Jenny's eyes, like a gypsy's lies
Cut right through the night

52:41.909 --> 52:44.118
"Now those eyes are another guy's
And I'm alone with my pain"

52:44.203 --> 52:45.328
That was clean.

52:45.412 --> 52:47.413
Are you shitting
me with this, Adam?

52:48.749 --> 52:49.958
Look, you can
recite it straight

52:50.042 --> 52:51.417
or to the tune of
Sweet Child O' Mine.

52:51.502 --> 52:52.585
It doesn't matter.

52:52.670 --> 52:56.005
Are these mushrooms?
Did you eat these mushrooms, Adam?

52:56.090 --> 52:58.633
I like to eat them, you know?
A couple of them.

52:58.717 --> 53:00.426
Holy fuck, man,
you gotta stay straight!

53:00.552 --> 53:02.428
- You gotta help me get the guys back!
- Just relax.

53:02.513 --> 53:04.263
You know, it's not always about
my emotional journey.

53:04.348 --> 53:05.848
- It could be about yours.
- Put the coke down!

53:05.933 --> 53:07.433
- God damn it, you little fucker!
- Give it to me!

53:07.518 --> 53:10.186
Don't you fucking get it?
I'm not gonna be fucking born!

53:13.816 --> 53:16.442
How much worse
can it get?

53:16.610 --> 53:18.236
What? The '80s?

53:18.821 --> 53:20.697
New part shorted
out another part.

53:20.781 --> 53:22.699
I hope we can get
that thing working before dawn.

53:22.783 --> 53:23.866
Wait, wait, hold on,

53:23.951 --> 53:25.743
is that when
the time portal closes,
at dawn?

53:25.828 --> 53:27.203
That's when
the party's over.

53:27.287 --> 53:28.705
Fuck you, man. Listen.

53:28.789 --> 53:31.207
I am at
my wit's end with him,
so you gotta level with me.

53:31.291 --> 53:33.584
Are you the mystical
time-travel guide-guy or not?

53:33.669 --> 53:35.920
Don't you put
your hands on me, young lady!

53:37.089 --> 53:38.965
I'm just trying
to do my job, here.

53:39.049 --> 53:41.134
Fuck, hold on.
Quit eating mushrooms, man!

53:41.260 --> 53:42.969
I wanna have a few more.

53:45.305 --> 53:48.307
What the fuck
is happening to me?
I can't...

53:49.143 --> 53:50.143
Dawn.

53:53.981 --> 53:55.064
Hey, Adam.

53:55.149 --> 53:58.067
All right, so anyway,
the repairman's doing his thing.

53:58.152 --> 53:59.360
I'm gonna go
find Nick and Lou,

53:59.445 --> 54:00.862
and you stay right here.
Okay?

54:00.946 --> 54:01.904
I'm gonna stay.

54:01.989 --> 54:03.573
You got it,
but you can't leave.

54:03.657 --> 54:06.159
I can't move,
because I'm broken.

54:06.952 --> 54:08.786
Man, you and my mom
are so fucked.

54:11.040 --> 54:12.498
Hungry.

54:14.168 --> 54:15.168
Evening.

54:15.252 --> 54:16.419
You've got two arms.

54:17.171 --> 54:19.088
But you're not going to.
You're gonna lose one.

54:19.673 --> 54:20.715
What?

54:20.799 --> 54:22.175
You're gonna lose that arm.

54:24.178 --> 54:25.553
You're one of those joker guys.

54:25.637 --> 54:26.679
Right. Right.

54:26.764 --> 54:29.432
I don't care if you put that arm
in a steel fucking vault,

54:29.516 --> 54:31.184
that arm's coming off!

54:31.518 --> 54:32.810
You're gonna lose your arm.

54:32.895 --> 54:34.270
You're gonna lose your arm!

54:34.354 --> 54:35.646
I'm gonna rape you.
I'm gonna rape you!

54:35.731 --> 54:37.899
I'm gonna rape you.
I'm gonna rape you.

54:37.983 --> 54:39.650
- Have a great night.
- Okay.

54:39.985 --> 54:41.694
<i>...to the end zone.
Touchdown Cleveland!</i>

54:44.323 --> 54:46.157
Pay up, suckers!
Pay up!

54:46.241 --> 54:49.660
How does he do it?
How is he right
all the time?

54:49.745 --> 54:51.412
Let me ask you
something, McFly.

54:52.206 --> 54:53.456
How you getting so lucky?

54:53.540 --> 54:55.541
I know the fucking future,
douche bag.

54:55.709 --> 54:57.335
Really? One more bet.

54:57.419 --> 55:00.088
Ricky, come on.
You said one more
and then you'd be done.

55:00.380 --> 55:02.632
I also said to shut the fuck up.
Remember that?

55:02.716 --> 55:04.592
Okay, I love you.
Shut the fuck up.

55:04.802 --> 55:05.968
By the way,
I love your coat.

55:06.053 --> 55:07.887
I don't give a shit
about animals, either, so...

55:08.388 --> 55:09.847
One more bet.
High stakes.

55:09.932 --> 55:12.433
All right. All right.
Bring it on, Spader.

55:12.518 --> 55:14.060
Bring it on, Jo-Jo.

55:14.186 --> 55:15.978
I bet Elway throws
a touchdown pass

55:16.063 --> 55:17.897
with 37 seconds
left on the clock.

55:18.065 --> 55:20.316
Fat chance, asshole.
Elway's done nothing
all day.

55:20.400 --> 55:23.694
Well then, in the spirit of high stakes,
let's make it interesting.

55:23.779 --> 55:24.821
Let's make it
interesting.

55:24.905 --> 55:28.491
If I win, your wife gives me a blowjob.

55:28.909 --> 55:30.118
Really?

55:30.202 --> 55:31.369
A classy one.

55:34.164 --> 55:35.790
- Hey, screw you, kid.
- Hey, okay,

55:35.874 --> 55:38.209
and if you win,
name your price.

55:39.753 --> 55:41.754
Touchdown pass at
37 seconds, exactly?

55:41.839 --> 55:43.256
Exactly.

55:44.049 --> 55:45.258
Fine.

55:45.509 --> 55:46.926
You lose,
I take all your winnings.

55:47.010 --> 55:48.052
Done.

55:48.137 --> 55:49.512
And you give your
buddy a blowjob.

55:49.596 --> 55:51.514
What? Hell, no.

55:51.598 --> 55:52.765
Wow!

55:52.850 --> 55:53.933
- Deal.
- Deal?

55:53.976 --> 55:55.726
- Well done. I like your style.
- I like your style.

55:55.811 --> 55:56.894
He's very creative.

55:56.979 --> 55:59.397
I don't like you
taking liberties with my dick.

55:59.565 --> 56:01.023
Relax, okay?

56:01.108 --> 56:03.609
We know the fucking future.
We can't lose.

56:06.572 --> 56:10.616
Hey. Hey, there.
What are you doing?

56:11.368 --> 56:12.827
- Hi.
- Hey.

56:13.662 --> 56:15.246
Okay, how's the view
from down there?

56:19.209 --> 56:20.626
It's nice.

56:22.296 --> 56:23.504
Adam, right?

56:24.715 --> 56:25.840
Yeah.

56:25.924 --> 56:27.383
Why are you
bleeding in the snow?

56:27.467 --> 56:28.593
That? No, I...

56:28.677 --> 56:31.304
I got stabbed in the face with a fork.

56:31.847 --> 56:34.807
I saw it coming and I avoided it.
I mean, I didn't avoid it.

56:35.017 --> 56:37.935
It just happened again to me
in a slightly different way.

56:38.395 --> 56:41.522
Boy, I really wish
I knew what the fuck you were talking about.

56:43.192 --> 56:45.735
All the choices we make in our life,
they're pointless.

56:45.819 --> 56:47.695
There's no escaping
the inevitable.

56:48.197 --> 56:49.655
I don't know, man.

56:52.326 --> 56:55.912
So, you're saying that your whole
entire life is predetermined to suck,

56:55.996 --> 56:57.205
no matter what you do?

56:57.289 --> 56:58.706
It's not the way
I want it, but...

56:58.874 --> 57:01.459
Kind of seems like
a really, really good excuse

57:01.543 --> 57:04.629
to do something totally amazing
right now, tonight.

57:06.089 --> 57:07.298
Like what?

57:07.966 --> 57:12.136
Like perhaps
hang out with a girl that you just met

57:12.221 --> 57:14.597
before her bus
has to leave in two hours?

57:15.182 --> 57:16.265
Right-o.

57:17.267 --> 57:18.976
I thought you said
we were going to get some food.

57:19.061 --> 57:22.021
We are.
We're about to get some food.

57:22.105 --> 57:24.690
I'm pretty hungry,
actually.

57:24.858 --> 57:27.109
Damn it.
They forgot to leave the key.

57:27.277 --> 57:28.361
Who did?

57:28.445 --> 57:31.906
Carol and Stan Stapleton.
They're my friends. They live here,

57:31.990 --> 57:34.784
and I housesit for them
when they go to Nepal, sometimes.

57:34.952 --> 57:36.827
I thought you said
you came in here on a bus.

57:36.912 --> 57:39.997
They usually do leave,
like, a side door open.

57:40.207 --> 57:42.041
- They do?
- So let me... I'll be right back.

57:42.376 --> 57:43.376
Okay.

57:44.836 --> 57:46.712
Yep, it's unlocked.

57:51.468 --> 57:52.677
Cheers.

57:53.220 --> 57:55.388
So which one's Carol?

57:58.350 --> 57:59.642
Carol's on the left.

58:00.811 --> 58:03.062
<i>Elway's last stand.
45 seconds left on the clock.</i>

58:03.397 --> 58:05.815
I'm really good at getting head.
You'll see.

58:07.067 --> 58:08.484
<i>- Elway takes the snap.
- Go, baby.</i>

58:08.568 --> 58:11.821
<i>He fades back. Elway fires.
He's got Jackson open.</i>

58:11.905 --> 58:13.656
<i>He's impossibly open!</i>

58:13.740 --> 58:15.324
<i>Wait, what's this? Vermin?</i>

58:15.409 --> 58:16.909
No, no, no!
I know this squirrel.

58:16.994 --> 58:18.995
<i>That's a magic fucking squirrel.
This doesn't count.</i>

58:19.079 --> 58:20.371
<i>He's distracted by a wild squirrel!</i>

58:20.455 --> 58:21.497
<i>What the fuck?</i>

58:21.581 --> 58:24.458
<i>Incomplete! Game's over!
Cleveland wins!</i>

58:24.543 --> 58:26.794
The Dawg Pound is going
to the Super Bowl.

58:26.878 --> 58:28.004
Oh, yeah!

58:28.088 --> 58:29.547
<i>I've never seen anything like it!</i>

58:30.882 --> 58:32.008
He did it. Got to go!

58:32.092 --> 58:33.509
Congratulations.
Look at all that money.

58:33.593 --> 58:36.804
I was kidding about the blowjob thing.
Obviously, we're comedians.

58:36.888 --> 58:38.389
Hey, guys. Guys.

58:39.099 --> 58:40.474
A bet's a bet.

58:42.769 --> 58:44.603
Motherfucker!

58:45.939 --> 58:47.189
So you're a Time Lord?

58:47.274 --> 58:48.399
Mmm-hmm.

58:48.483 --> 58:51.485
And a Jacuzzi is your spaceship?

58:52.321 --> 58:53.529
That is correct, madam.

58:53.697 --> 58:55.448
That's the only part
of this whole thing

58:55.532 --> 58:57.199
that doesn't make sense to me.

58:57.284 --> 58:59.744
You're not the only one.
Believe me.

58:59.828 --> 59:02.663
I mean, the whole thing
is just totally insane.

59:02.789 --> 59:03.831
Ew!

59:05.167 --> 59:07.084
So, how's the future
working out for you?

59:07.169 --> 59:09.670
I mean,
are you like a happy grownup?

59:10.005 --> 59:11.047
Not particularly, no.

59:11.131 --> 59:12.131
Yeah.

59:12.215 --> 59:14.633
My friends actually
think I ended up being

59:14.718 --> 59:17.094
a completely selfish,
fucked-up person.

59:17.888 --> 59:19.889
And they may have a point,
actually, if I think about it.

59:19.973 --> 59:21.015
Hmm...

59:21.099 --> 59:23.434
I'll tell you something I haven't told
somebody for a long time.

59:23.727 --> 59:24.894
When I was a kid,

59:24.978 --> 59:28.147
every Friday night,
my father used to take my sister Kelly and me

59:28.231 --> 59:31.859
to this place called Flatirons
for steak sandwiches.

59:31.943 --> 59:32.985
It was a family tradition.

59:33.070 --> 59:34.862
That's sometimes
a good thing.

59:35.030 --> 59:37.573
But one year,
we saw this commercial

59:38.200 --> 59:40.826
for this place called
The Enchanted Forest of Pizza.

59:41.495 --> 59:45.122
So the next Friday,
my dad's loading us up into the car.

59:45.290 --> 59:48.292
We're like, "Daddy, we want
to go to The Enchanted Forest of Pizza."

59:48.377 --> 59:50.086
And he's like,
"What are you talking about?

59:50.170 --> 59:52.171
"We always go for
steak sandwiches."

59:52.255 --> 59:53.923
But we just stay at him

59:54.007 --> 59:56.967
and we're whining,
and we're badgering, and finally he relents.

59:57.052 --> 59:58.511
Nice. So, you win.

59:58.595 --> 01:00:01.263
You deviated from the plan
in a really big way. That's good.

01:00:02.224 --> 01:00:04.308
33 people died of E. Coli.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:06.977
Including my father.

01:00:07.521 --> 01:00:09.647
<i>Before he died, he looked at me and he
said,</i>

01:00:09.815 --> 01:00:11.315
"Adam, you did this."

01:00:11.483 --> 01:00:12.858
No, he didn't.

01:00:13.026 --> 01:00:14.193
Yes, he did,

01:00:14.569 --> 01:00:15.611
with his eyes.

01:00:15.695 --> 01:00:18.447
I don't think that
that's what he meant with his eyes.

01:00:18.532 --> 01:00:22.451
The point is that Kelly and I dealt with
the guilt of this in very different ways.

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:24.036
She went wild, right?

01:00:24.204 --> 01:00:25.871
She didn't want to have control over anything.

01:00:26.039 --> 01:00:28.290
But I vowed to master the chaos,

01:00:28.375 --> 01:00:30.126
- to impose order.
- Adam, I really don't think

01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:33.879
that you can let a poison pizza ruin
the rest of your life.

01:00:34.423 --> 01:00:37.258
You got to embrace the chaos.
You have to.

01:00:37.426 --> 01:00:40.970
That way, life might just
astonish you.

01:00:50.439 --> 01:00:52.314
- I had so much fun tonight.
- I know!

01:00:52.399 --> 01:00:53.732
Fuck! Game on.

01:00:56.236 --> 01:00:57.236
- You look so hot, by the way.
- Thanks.

01:00:58.613 --> 01:01:00.573
I said,
start sucking, gaylord.

01:01:01.199 --> 01:01:03.242
Yeah! Suck!

01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:04.452
Suck that shit, man!

01:01:04.536 --> 01:01:07.830
- Suck! Suck! Suck!
- Suck! Suck! Suck!

01:01:07.914 --> 01:01:09.832
Who are you people?

01:01:09.916 --> 01:01:12.209
God, who are you people?

01:01:12.294 --> 01:01:14.295
Let's get on with this.
My fondue's getting cold.

01:01:14.379 --> 01:01:15.880
Choke on that horn, man!

01:01:19.759 --> 01:01:20.801
Oh!

01:01:20.886 --> 01:01:22.720
Wow, good for you.

01:01:22.804 --> 01:01:23.888
I know, right?

01:01:23.972 --> 01:01:26.515
It's like Gary Coleman's
fucking forearm.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.601
It's so black!

01:01:28.727 --> 01:01:31.187
It's so impossibly black.

01:01:32.272 --> 01:01:34.648
- I love you, buddy.
- Don't say that!

01:01:34.733 --> 01:01:36.066
I'm sorry, I do.

01:01:36.985 --> 01:01:38.194
No, no, no!

01:01:50.624 --> 01:01:52.541
Hey, you.

01:01:52.959 --> 01:01:55.211
Maybe what you need
isn't in here, after all.

01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:59.507
Maybe what you need
has always been in here.

01:01:59.925 --> 01:02:01.342
- Really?
- No.

01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:06.639
The tub?
Is it fixed yet?

01:02:06.806 --> 01:02:08.807
Can be. Ready to go?

01:02:08.892 --> 01:02:10.100
Wait, go where?

01:02:10.185 --> 01:02:12.228
To the room, check it out.
I've got the part right here.

01:02:12.312 --> 01:02:13.479
Yeah. Yeah, let's go.

01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:14.647
- Let's go.
- Right.

01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:21.111
- Where did he go?
- Who?

01:02:21.196 --> 01:02:22.821
This fucking guy.

01:02:24.241 --> 01:02:26.742
Nicholas.

01:02:28.036 --> 01:02:30.412
Nicky. Nicholas.

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:34.041
Hey! There he is!

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:36.001
- What?
- What the fuck?

01:02:36.086 --> 01:02:37.211
What? What?

01:02:38.505 --> 01:02:40.506
What, do I still
have some on my face?

01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:42.925
Oh, God!

01:02:43.009 --> 01:02:44.260
Damn!

01:02:45.554 --> 01:02:47.221
Did you have
pineapple today?

01:02:47.305 --> 01:02:49.640
I can't go home.
What the fuck?

01:02:50.058 --> 01:02:51.850
I'm fucking with you, dude.

01:02:51.935 --> 01:02:53.143
It's hand soap.

01:02:54.354 --> 01:02:56.438
Oh, my God. Relax.

01:02:56.523 --> 01:02:58.274
It's like you haven't
seen a little come

01:02:58.358 --> 01:03:00.234
on your friend's face before,
or something.

01:03:00.318 --> 01:03:02.111
What the fuck is
wrong with you, man?

01:03:02.195 --> 01:03:04.863
I'm just kidding.
It's what friends do. God!

01:03:04.948 --> 01:03:06.115
You didn't?

01:03:06.199 --> 01:03:08.576
Gargle your hog?
No, man.

01:03:09.035 --> 01:03:11.161
After they pulled you off of me,
me and Rick talked it out.

01:03:11.246 --> 01:03:12.746
He's actually
a pretty cool guy.

01:03:12.831 --> 01:03:16.375
We have a lot in common.
We both love tits and Motley Crue.

01:03:16.543 --> 01:03:17.751
It's cool?

01:03:17.836 --> 01:03:19.378
Yeah, I just told
him a bunch of shit

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:21.005
that's gonna make
him rich in the future.

01:03:21.172 --> 01:03:23.215
I saved
the good stuff for us.

01:03:23.967 --> 01:03:26.427
Let's go to the bar,
plan our empire.

01:03:31.391 --> 01:03:34.643
Fucking iPods, you know?
Fucking Prius.

01:03:35.061 --> 01:03:38.689
Match. Com. Anything. Com.
Fucking Internet. Com!

01:03:38.857 --> 01:03:43.110
Fucking Zac Efron.
Nobody invented him yet.

01:03:43.194 --> 01:03:45.988
What about Twitter?
Whatever the fuck that is.

01:03:46.072 --> 01:03:50.618
Hey, we could combine
Twitter with fucking Viagra.

01:03:51.745 --> 01:03:53.203
Twitt-agra.

01:03:54.581 --> 01:03:55.956
What's the matter, dude?
Come on.

01:03:56.041 --> 01:03:59.293
I'm sorry, man.
I'm just preoccupied.

01:03:59.753 --> 01:04:02.838
You just kind of down
about being black and out of shape?

01:04:02.964 --> 01:04:05.007
What the fuck is
wrong with you? No.

01:04:05.091 --> 01:04:06.759
Because you look good,
you know?

01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:08.719
This is a great time
for black people.

01:04:09.095 --> 01:04:10.095
I mean our time,
not this time.

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:11.555
This is a terrible time
for black people.

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:13.891
I don't see one other
black person in here.

01:04:15.143 --> 01:04:16.435
Talk to me, man.

01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:18.187
I found out she
fucking cheated.

01:04:18.355 --> 01:04:21.315
What? Courtney's
fucking cheating on you?

01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:24.735
I gave her my life,
I gave up my passion.

01:04:24.944 --> 01:04:26.195
And she's just
out there...

01:04:26.279 --> 01:04:28.155
Why the fuck
didn't you say something, man?

01:04:28.239 --> 01:04:31.450
That's just it!
I never see you guys anymore.

01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:34.495
I don't have my music,
I barely have friends.

01:04:34.996 --> 01:04:36.205
Without Courtney,

01:04:36.873 --> 01:04:37.956
I'm nothing.

01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:40.292
You're just fucking
Courtney's bitch right now.

01:04:40.377 --> 01:04:42.878
You need to be
your own man,
you know?

01:04:43.046 --> 01:04:44.838
"Nick Webber-Agnew"?
What the fuck is that?

01:04:44.923 --> 01:04:46.298
- It's terrible.
- It doesn't work.

01:04:46.383 --> 01:04:48.967
No. Nick Webber,
that's who you are.

01:04:49.761 --> 01:04:51.220
That's who I was.

01:04:51.513 --> 01:04:53.472
Maybe you gotta
find him again.

01:04:53.765 --> 01:04:57.101
You know, she's getting hers,
you go get yours.

01:04:57.936 --> 01:04:59.311
I can't, man.

01:04:59.479 --> 01:05:01.105
It means something
to me to be married.

01:05:01.189 --> 01:05:03.148
You're not fucking married.
It's 1986.

01:05:03.233 --> 01:05:04.274
In my heart I am.

01:05:04.359 --> 01:05:05.818
Your heart's
a fucking liar.

01:05:14.994 --> 01:05:17.830
You know what?
You know what you got to do?

01:05:17.997 --> 01:05:19.039
What?

01:05:19.582 --> 01:05:21.667
You gotta get your
ass up on that stage.

01:05:23.336 --> 01:05:24.503
You're right.

01:05:26.005 --> 01:05:27.005
I'm gonna do it.

01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:28.132
Yeah. Do it.

01:05:28.216 --> 01:05:31.343
Hey, hey, hey.
Do it fucking quickly, okay?

01:05:31.511 --> 01:05:32.720
You better be at
that fight with me.

01:05:32.804 --> 01:05:33.762
Don't leave me
hanging this time.

01:05:33.847 --> 01:05:35.347
- I won't. I promise.
- All right.

01:05:35.849 --> 01:05:38.267
Hey, Adam. Fuck.

01:05:41.688 --> 01:05:42.855
Guys?

01:05:48.695 --> 01:05:49.945
You're good to go.

01:05:50.572 --> 01:05:51.655
Holy shit. Really?

01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:53.532
Some sort of
sticky liquid got into

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:56.034
the crossover housing,
I don't know.

01:05:56.202 --> 01:05:58.203
Must have had some
nitratriminium in it.

01:05:59.205 --> 01:06:00.539
It's Chernobly.

01:06:00.623 --> 01:06:03.459
Whatever it was, it ravaged
the hell out of the electronics.

01:06:03.543 --> 01:06:05.753
Worked out for you
and the boys, though.

01:06:05.837 --> 01:06:06.962
Wait, hold on,
are you saying that

01:06:07.046 --> 01:06:08.130
that's the key to
the whole thing?

01:06:08.214 --> 01:06:09.465
We need the Chernobly
to get back?

01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:13.510
All I'm saying is, whatever your poison,
I wouldn't tub without it.

01:06:13.595 --> 01:06:15.262
Especially after dawn.

01:06:15.346 --> 01:06:17.723
It'd kill you
to give me a straight answer?

01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:20.476
You know,
you're kind of a dick.

01:06:20.894 --> 01:06:23.604
Hey, everybody,
you ready to jam?

01:06:23.772 --> 01:06:25.022
All right.

01:06:25.106 --> 01:06:28.317
Ladies and gentlemen,
help me welcome to the stage

01:06:28.401 --> 01:06:30.235
Nick Webber!

01:06:31.321 --> 01:06:32.488
Hi.

01:06:33.656 --> 01:06:35.491
It's been a long time.

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.165
¢Ü No, I'm never
gonna dance again ¢Ü

01:06:43.249 --> 01:06:46.627
¢Ü Guilty feet
have got no rhythm ¢Ü

01:06:55.929 --> 01:06:58.096
¢Ü Jessie is a friend ¢Ü

01:06:59.098 --> 01:07:02.601
¢Ü Yeah, I know he's been
a good friend of mine ¢Ü

01:07:03.102 --> 01:07:06.480
¢Ü But lately something's changed
It ain't hard to define ¢Ü

01:07:06.564 --> 01:07:09.942
¢Ü Jessie's got himself a girl
And I want to make her mine ¢Ü

01:07:12.654 --> 01:07:14.863
These guys are dangerous.
Look at this stuff.

01:07:14.948 --> 01:07:16.782
Blaine, it looks
like a skinny soda can.

01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:20.702
No, a soda-can bomb!
This stuff's straight out of Moscow.

01:07:20.787 --> 01:07:22.746
Let's go kick
that Commie's ass!

01:07:22.831 --> 01:07:23.872
Chaz.

01:07:23.957 --> 01:07:26.458
Shouldn't we call the cops
or the FBI or something?

01:07:26.918 --> 01:07:29.920
No, we're gonna
handle this internally.

01:07:39.472 --> 01:07:40.639
¢Ü I wish that I had ¢Ü

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:42.391
¢Ü Jessie's girl ¢Ü

01:07:42.725 --> 01:07:44.017
¢Ü I wish that I had ¢Ü

01:07:44.102 --> 01:07:45.811
¢Ü Jessie's girl ¢Ü

01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:55.112
¢Ü Yeah ¢Ü

01:08:00.368 --> 01:08:03.495
This song is from the future,
but since you've been good,

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:04.830
you get it early.

01:08:04.914 --> 01:08:06.582
Just like we rehearsed.

01:08:07.542 --> 01:08:10.335
¢Ü Let's get it started ¢Ü

01:08:10.461 --> 01:08:12.504
¢Ü in here ¢Ü

01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:18.926
¢Ü And the bass keep runnin' runnin'
And runnin' runnin' ¢Ü

01:08:19.011 --> 01:08:26.100
¢Ü And runnin' runnin'
And runnin' runnin' ¢Ü

01:08:26.185 --> 01:08:28.437
¢Ü In this context
There's no disrespect ¢Ü

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:30.647
¢Ü So when I bust my rhyme
You break your necks ¢Ü

01:08:30.732 --> 01:08:32.941
¢Ü We got five minutes
For us to disconnect ¢Ü

01:08:33.026 --> 01:08:35.234
¢Ü From all intellect
Collect the rhythm effect ¢Ü

01:08:35.319 --> 01:08:37.779
¢Ü So lose your inhibition
Follow your intuition ¢Ü

01:08:37.863 --> 01:08:40.115
¢Ü Free your inner soul
And break away from tradition ¢Ü

01:08:40.198 --> 01:08:41.950
¢Ü 'Cause when we beat out
Girl, it's putting heat out ¢Ü

01:08:42.035 --> 01:08:44.493
¢Ü You wouldn't believe
How we wow shit out ¢Ü

01:08:44.578 --> 01:08:46.622
¢Ü Burn it till it's burned out
Turn it till it's turned out ¢Ü

01:08:46.706 --> 01:08:49.332
¢Ü Act up from north,
west, east, south ¢Ü

01:08:49.417 --> 01:08:52.794
¢Ü Everybody, everybody
Let's get into it ¢Ü

01:08:52.879 --> 01:08:55.130
¢Ü Get stupid
Get it started ¢Ü

01:08:55.214 --> 01:08:56.965
¢Ü Get it started
Get it started ¢Ü

01:08:57.050 --> 01:09:05.849
¢Ü Let's get it started
Let's get it started in here ¢Ü

01:09:07.727 --> 01:09:10.895
¢Ü Everybody, everybody
Let's get into it ¢Ü

01:09:11.064 --> 01:09:13.357
¢Ü Get stupid
Get it started ¢Ü

01:09:13.441 --> 01:09:16.984
¢Ü Get it started, get it started
Let's get it started ¢Ü

01:09:17.069 --> 01:09:19.029
Hey, where's
the Kodiak Club?

01:09:19.113 --> 01:09:20.404
Down the street, dude.

01:09:20.573 --> 01:09:22.366
Okay. Okay, thank you.

01:09:22.533 --> 01:09:25.327
Listen, me and my boys
got some shit-kicking to do.

01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:26.995
But this

01:09:30.249 --> 01:09:31.416
Ain't over.

01:09:32.126 --> 01:09:33.542
Get out of my way, stool.

01:09:34.671 --> 01:09:36.964
¢Ü Transmit hits
with no delusion ¢Ü

01:09:37.048 --> 01:09:39.716
¢Ü The feeling's irresistible
And that's how we moving ¢Ü

01:09:39.884 --> 01:09:41.676
¢Ü Everybody
Everybody ¢Ü

01:09:41.761 --> 01:09:43.011
¢Ü Let's get into it ¢Ü

01:09:43.095 --> 01:09:44.220
That's my boy,
right there.

01:09:44.389 --> 01:09:46.098
- The singer?
- Yeah.

01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:48.558
¢Ü Let's get it started ¢Ü

01:09:48.725 --> 01:09:51.603
I'll be back. My friends are over there.
I'll come right back.

01:09:52.270 --> 01:09:54.272
¢Ü Lose control
Of body and soul ¢Ü

01:09:54.357 --> 01:09:56.858
¢Ü Don't move too fast, people
Just take it slow ¢Ü

01:09:56.943 --> 01:09:59.403
I'm caught right in the middle
of a thing right now,

01:09:59.487 --> 01:10:01.029
but can I text you later?

01:10:01.114 --> 01:10:02.864
- Can you what?
- Are you online at all?

01:10:02.949 --> 01:10:04.533
I have no idea
what you're saying.

01:10:04.617 --> 01:10:05.826
How do I get
a hold of you?

01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:07.869
You come find me.

01:10:07.954 --> 01:10:09.121
That just sounds

01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:11.081
exhausting.

01:10:11.541 --> 01:10:12.541
¢Ü With no delusion ¢Ü

01:10:12.625 --> 01:10:15.168
¢Ü The feeling's irresistible
And that's how we moving ¢Ü

01:10:15.253 --> 01:10:17.045
There he is.
Where are your boys?

01:10:17.130 --> 01:10:18.880
I thought they were
gonna hold your sack.

01:10:18.965 --> 01:10:20.549
Let's kick his ass, Blaine.

01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:24.553
Where are my fucking friends?

01:10:24.804 --> 01:10:26.304
¢Ü Whoo-hoo! Let's get ¢Ü

01:10:26.472 --> 01:10:28.140
¢Ü Whoo-hoo! In here ¢Ü

01:10:28.307 --> 01:10:30.267
¢Ü Let's get Whoo-hoo! ¢Ü

01:10:30.435 --> 01:10:32.102
¢Ü While I get Whoo-hoo! ¢Ü

01:10:32.854 --> 01:10:34.730
- You like that song?
- Yeah, it's great.

01:10:34.814 --> 01:10:35.939
It's gonna be a hit.

01:10:43.531 --> 01:10:47.451
¢Ü And runnin' runnin'
And runnin' runnin' ¢Ü

01:10:52.707 --> 01:10:55.125
Thank you. Thank you.

01:10:56.794 --> 01:10:58.045
Yes.

01:10:58.129 --> 01:10:59.546
That was sweet.

01:10:59.672 --> 01:11:01.423
All right.
All right, man.

01:11:03.176 --> 01:11:05.093
Good to have you back,
see you back up there, man.

01:11:05.178 --> 01:11:07.262
Hey, it's coming back.
I should have
done this years ago.

01:11:07.346 --> 01:11:10.265
- Guys. Adam. Guys!
- About time.

01:11:10.349 --> 01:11:12.267
Did you see him?
Did you see him rock out?

01:11:12.351 --> 01:11:14.895
Shut up! Okay, we gotta find
the Chernobly to get out of here.

01:11:15.063 --> 01:11:16.063
Chernobly? Why?

01:11:16.147 --> 01:11:17.272
I don't know, exactly.

01:11:17.356 --> 01:11:21.109
But the repairman said
it's got nitro-trainium...

01:11:21.277 --> 01:11:22.652
- Nitratrinanium.
- Thank you.

01:11:22.737 --> 01:11:25.363
Or some shit in it
that'll fix the time machine.

01:11:25.531 --> 01:11:27.365
- That makes sense.
- Where's Lou?

01:11:27.533 --> 01:11:29.534
Where is...
What time is it?

01:11:30.203 --> 01:11:33.330
Fuck! Fuck! Shit! Shit!

01:11:36.042 --> 01:11:37.084
Lou!

01:11:38.711 --> 01:11:40.378
- Where is he?
- Fuck.

01:11:42.131 --> 01:11:44.633
Oh, my God!
We missed it again!

01:11:45.718 --> 01:11:47.761
Well, where do you think
he went?

01:11:49.222 --> 01:11:51.056
Same place as last time?

01:11:52.475 --> 01:11:56.228
¢Ü Keeps me together at the seams ¢Ü

01:11:56.395 --> 01:11:59.022
¢Ü I'm on my way ¢Ü

01:11:59.565 --> 01:12:01.191
Shut up, you flamer!

01:12:01.859 --> 01:12:04.736
¢Ü I'm on my way ¢Ü

01:12:05.571 --> 01:12:07.906
Hey, go home! Loser!

01:12:08.074 --> 01:12:09.991
Hey, John Lennon gets shot!

01:12:10.576 --> 01:12:12.077
Wait, did that
already happen?

01:12:14.497 --> 01:12:15.664
Lou!

01:12:17.083 --> 01:12:18.291
Whoo!

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:23.588
They made it, everybody!
Whoo!
Best friends in the world!

01:12:23.756 --> 01:12:25.132
Almost just in time!

01:12:26.884 --> 01:12:28.218
My buddies.

01:12:28.386 --> 01:12:31.513
Fucking Chimney Point, right?
Here we are.

01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:33.932
Bottle of scotch,
end of the night.

01:12:35.601 --> 01:12:36.977
Where were you?

01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:38.645
We were just...
We came...

01:12:38.729 --> 01:12:40.730
Not tonight.
Every fucking night.

01:12:41.274 --> 01:12:44.401
Huh? What happened?
We were gonna do shit together, man.

01:12:44.485 --> 01:12:47.487
We were gonna conquer the fucking world.
Me and you.

01:12:47.572 --> 01:12:48.989
And then you cut me off.

01:12:49.073 --> 01:12:50.198
What was I
gonna do, man?

01:12:50.283 --> 01:12:52.951
I was gonna let you drag me down
into your bullshit, Lou?

01:12:53.119 --> 01:12:55.203
Yeah. Yes, because
that's what friends do.

01:12:55.288 --> 01:12:56.705
No, they don't, man!

01:12:56.789 --> 01:12:58.456
Because then there's two people
stuck in the bullshit

01:12:58.541 --> 01:12:59.708
instead of your sorry ass.

01:12:59.792 --> 01:13:03.962
You should stick by your friends
through thick and thin!

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:10.635
Okay, great.
I got two things to say to you.

01:13:11.095 --> 01:13:12.387
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:13:12.722 --> 01:13:15.140
Number one, I hate you.

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:16.600
Got it.

01:13:16.684 --> 01:13:18.476
Our friendship means nothing.

01:13:19.478 --> 01:13:20.937
All right, is that the first thing
or the second thing?

01:13:21.022 --> 01:13:23.481
What? No, clearly that's still part
of the first thing.

01:13:23.649 --> 01:13:24.983
- I mean, am I the asshole?
- Did you get that?

01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:26.735
- No, I didn't get it. I thought...
- He didn't get it.

01:13:26.819 --> 01:13:28.069
He said A and B...

01:13:28.154 --> 01:13:30.572
Let's agree to disagree
about the "first" thing.

01:13:30.656 --> 01:13:33.950
Lou, where is the Chernobly?
We need it to get back.

01:13:34.035 --> 01:13:35.952
"Where's the Chernobly
at, Lou?"

01:13:36.037 --> 01:13:38.246
That's all you ever
fucking care about.

01:13:38.331 --> 01:13:39.581
It's the first time
he mentioned it.

01:13:39.665 --> 01:13:41.249
Yeah, and even if we had
mentioned it before,

01:13:41.334 --> 01:13:44.085
it's kind of a fucking big deal, okay?
I wanna go home.

01:13:44.253 --> 01:13:45.629
Come on, Lou.
Let's talk about this inside.

01:13:45.713 --> 01:13:46.922
You got no shoes on.
It's cold out.

01:13:47.006 --> 01:13:48.506
Who took my fucking shoe?

01:13:48.591 --> 01:13:51.051
Blaine apparently beat your shoe
off of you,

01:13:51.135 --> 01:13:53.094
which I don't even know how
that could fucking happen.

01:13:53.179 --> 01:13:57.140
Okay, fuck it!
Fuck you, fuck you and fuck you!

01:13:57.225 --> 01:13:58.266
Easy, man.

01:13:58.351 --> 01:13:59.559
Whoa, Lou!

01:14:04.732 --> 01:14:05.899
I got you.

01:14:06.067 --> 01:14:07.359
Oh, my God!

01:14:07.526 --> 01:14:08.610
- Is Lou dead?
- Shit!

01:14:08.778 --> 01:14:10.237
There he is.

01:14:11.614 --> 01:14:12.781
I can't hold on.

01:14:12.865 --> 01:14:13.823
Yes, you can!

01:14:13.908 --> 01:14:14.950
Yes, you can hang on!

01:14:15.034 --> 01:14:16.701
- I'm slipping.
- No, hold on.

01:14:16.786 --> 01:14:18.787
No, Nick.
Hold on. Guys!

01:14:21.916 --> 01:14:23.792
Phil! Phil!

01:14:25.086 --> 01:14:26.544
Oh, fuck!

01:14:26.629 --> 01:14:29.464
We're dead! This is how it happens!
This is how he loses it!

01:14:29.632 --> 01:14:30.799
Fuck it!

01:14:30.967 --> 01:14:33.051
Fuck it, we're dead men!
Just let me go.

01:14:33.219 --> 01:14:34.803
Lou, be positive.

01:14:37.223 --> 01:14:38.932
The roof is
scraping my nut!

01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:40.809
Damn, you strong.

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:45.772
All right.

01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:48.817
You're all right?
I'm glad you guys are all right.

01:14:50.403 --> 01:14:51.903
My fault.

01:14:52.071 --> 01:14:53.947
Why do you do
shit like that?

01:14:54.115 --> 01:14:55.991
- I'm sorry! Jesus!
- Thank you, Phil.

01:14:56.575 --> 01:14:59.035
All right, here's the second
fucking thing, okay?

01:14:59.203 --> 01:15:00.662
Blaine's got the Chernobly.

01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:03.248
Let's just get it from him,
so we can get back to the present

01:15:03.332 --> 01:15:05.375
so I can start never seeing
you bitches again.

01:15:08.004 --> 01:15:09.337
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Hey.

01:15:09.422 --> 01:15:10.922
I was looking for you.
Where'd you go?

01:15:11.007 --> 01:15:13.842
I had to go...
My friend got in trouble, but I had to...

01:15:13.926 --> 01:15:15.135
I'm leaving right now.

01:15:15.303 --> 01:15:16.428
You're leaving right now?

01:15:16.512 --> 01:15:17.762
- Yeah.
- That's not good.

01:15:17.847 --> 01:15:19.556
I told you, I had two hours.
I gotta go.

01:15:20.683 --> 01:15:23.977
Uncle Adam, come on!
Who the fuck is that chick?

01:15:24.145 --> 01:15:25.270
Do you wanna come with me?

01:15:25.313 --> 01:15:26.354
- Get her fax number and let's go.
- Come on.

01:15:26.439 --> 01:15:27.856
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:30.150
You can do whatever you want, man.
It's your life.

01:15:30.234 --> 01:15:31.443
I want to.

01:15:31.527 --> 01:15:32.694
Good. Then come on.

01:15:32.778 --> 01:15:35.780
But I can't because my friends need me
and I gotta show up for them,

01:15:36.866 --> 01:15:38.283
so I really can't.

01:15:38.451 --> 01:15:39.743
Okay.

01:15:40.995 --> 01:15:43.455
So what are we...
I mean, do we...

01:15:43.873 --> 01:15:45.248
- What happens?
- I don't know.

01:15:45.416 --> 01:15:46.916
I'm not really
making any plans.

01:15:47.001 --> 01:15:49.210
I'm just sort of letting
the universe surprise me, right?

01:15:49.295 --> 01:15:50.712
I like that.
I like that a lot.

01:15:50.796 --> 01:15:51.880
That's the sign
of a happy man.

01:15:51.964 --> 01:15:53.173
April, let's go!

01:15:53.257 --> 01:15:54.466
Shit.

01:15:56.927 --> 01:15:59.929
Maybe the universe will
bring us together again.

01:16:00.139 --> 01:16:01.348
I hope.

01:16:08.814 --> 01:16:10.482
Casanova, let's do this!

01:16:19.992 --> 01:16:21.743
Just turn it around
and keep it running, okay?

01:16:21.827 --> 01:16:23.244
Yeah, sure thing.

01:16:24.330 --> 01:16:26.039
Okay.
You go this way,
I'll go this way?

01:16:26.207 --> 01:16:27.582
No, I'm gonna do the opposite
of everything you say.

01:16:27.666 --> 01:16:28.666
Great.

01:16:31.087 --> 01:16:33.088
Wonder which
one's Blaine's room.

01:16:36.592 --> 01:16:37.842
Housekeeping.

01:16:45.017 --> 01:16:46.518
Go, go, go.

01:16:59.198 --> 01:17:01.366
Let's try in here.
Where is it?

01:17:03.035 --> 01:17:05.036
Come on! Come on, come on.

01:17:09.375 --> 01:17:11.126
Panties, panties, panties!

01:17:12.044 --> 01:17:13.503
What the fuck are you doing?

01:17:13.587 --> 01:17:16.005
Why don't you shut
your slut mouth

01:17:16.090 --> 01:17:17.882
and mind your own fucking business?

01:17:17.967 --> 01:17:19.467
You disgust me.

01:17:25.099 --> 01:17:27.600
I love how much you hate you.

01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:31.354
Thank you.

01:17:36.235 --> 01:17:37.527
- They're here, come on.
- Fuck!

01:17:37.611 --> 01:17:39.446
"Fuck" as in, "The Chernobly's here
and we're all good"?

01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:41.406
No, "fuck" as in, "fuck!"

01:17:41.574 --> 01:17:42.657
Where's Nick?

01:17:42.741 --> 01:17:45.243
Admit it! You sucked his balls,
you licked his booty,

01:17:45.327 --> 01:17:47.078
you sucked his toes.

01:17:47.246 --> 01:17:48.538
Was his dick
bigger than mine?

01:17:48.622 --> 01:17:50.582
You wore the heels,
didn't you?

01:17:50.666 --> 01:17:51.749
Admit it, bitch!

01:17:52.626 --> 01:17:54.252
<i>There's gonna be
some changes, all right?</i>

01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:56.212
First, I'm dropping
"Agnew" from my name.

01:17:56.297 --> 01:17:57.338
No more hyphenate.

01:17:57.423 --> 01:17:59.215
Next, I'm getting
back on stage.

01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:01.676
I'm going back to music
because I jam.

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:03.178
But you wouldn't know
nothing about that

01:18:03.262 --> 01:18:05.972
because you're probably
somewhere sucking a motherfucker's dick!

01:18:06.599 --> 01:18:07.640
Excuse me?

01:18:08.767 --> 01:18:12.145
Hang up the phone, Jerry.
This shit don't concern you.

01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:13.229
How do you know my name?

01:18:13.314 --> 01:18:15.190
Hang up the phone,
motherfucker!

01:18:15.274 --> 01:18:16.774
This is between
me and my wife!

01:18:17.568 --> 01:18:19.527
Hey! Give me that phone!

01:18:19.612 --> 01:18:21.070
Give him the phone, Nick.

01:18:21.155 --> 01:18:23.239
I know what I'm doing.
I know what I'm doing!

01:18:23.324 --> 01:18:25.783
No, you don't, man.
Let it go! Let it go, man.

01:18:26.452 --> 01:18:29.287
Wrong number.
But you're a bad girl and you hurt him.

01:18:30.331 --> 01:18:32.707
Were you just yelling
at your 9-year-old wife?

01:18:33.918 --> 01:18:34.918
Yes.

01:18:36.629 --> 01:18:39.047
God damn it.
I'm gonna go nuclear on these guys.

01:18:39.131 --> 01:18:40.256
They couldn't
have gone far, man.

01:18:42.259 --> 01:18:44.928
Lou! Come on,
we gotta go.

01:18:45.804 --> 01:18:47.639
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:18:48.057 --> 01:18:49.224
Mom?

01:18:49.308 --> 01:18:50.600
Hey, did you find the Chernobly?

01:18:50.684 --> 01:18:51.809
You motherfucker!

01:18:53.604 --> 01:18:55.396
- Where did he go?
- Jacob?

01:18:55.481 --> 01:18:57.398
- What the fuck?
- What's happened?

01:19:00.486 --> 01:19:02.570
Oh, my God. I get it.

01:19:03.697 --> 01:19:05.114
I'm his father.

01:19:05.199 --> 01:19:06.282
What?

01:19:09.453 --> 01:19:10.828
Wait, so what do we do?

01:19:10.913 --> 01:19:11.996
Oh, my God.

01:19:14.041 --> 01:19:15.166
Hit that.

01:19:17.419 --> 01:19:18.962
You finish this.

01:19:20.214 --> 01:19:21.339
Okay.

01:19:21.632 --> 01:19:25.468
Lay down.
We got a stupid baby to make right now.

01:19:26.011 --> 01:19:28.012
I'm back inside of you.

01:19:28.931 --> 01:19:32.559
I can't believe I'm
fucking Adam's sister!

01:19:32.643 --> 01:19:35.478
I'm doing it!
I'm doing it!

01:19:36.063 --> 01:19:38.898
It's gonna take me a while
'cause I'm a little drunk.

01:19:39.066 --> 01:19:40.400
Oh, no, it's not.
Here I come.

01:19:40.568 --> 01:19:43.486
Oh, my God, I'm gonna come!
I'm gonna...

01:19:43.654 --> 01:19:46.072
Oh, Shia LaBeouf!

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:48.658
Dropping loads!

01:19:48.993 --> 01:19:53.246
So much fucking semen.
Little tiny Jacobs!

01:19:56.709 --> 01:19:59.002
There's my boy.

01:19:59.169 --> 01:20:01.796
It was so beautiful.
You sack of shit!

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:06.467
I knew there was a reason
I fucking hated you.

01:20:06.635 --> 01:20:07.760
And now I know why.

01:20:07.845 --> 01:20:11.139
I'm gonna tell everybody in prison that
I traveled back in time

01:20:11.223 --> 01:20:12.724
to kill my own father!

01:20:12.850 --> 01:20:14.767
- Jacob, get off him. Come on!
- Time out, young man.

01:20:14.852 --> 01:20:17.645
Get the fuck off of me!
You're a fucking dead man!

01:20:17.730 --> 01:20:18.771
Jacob!

01:20:18.856 --> 01:20:20.315
Nobody fucks my mother
in the past!

01:20:20.399 --> 01:20:22.191
I feel pregnant.

01:20:23.402 --> 01:20:24.902
You're welcome.

01:20:33.078 --> 01:20:34.621
You Commies looking for this?

01:20:34.705 --> 01:20:35.913
- Yes, actually.
- Yes, we are.

01:20:35.998 --> 01:20:37.248
That's what
we're looking for.

01:20:37.333 --> 01:20:38.583
You think we could get that back?

01:20:38.667 --> 01:20:39.792
No, you may not.

01:20:39.877 --> 01:20:42.962
But bad news for you, sport.
I'm a patriot.

01:20:43.047 --> 01:20:45.256
And I'm not about to let some
Ruskie fucks come into my town

01:20:45.341 --> 01:20:47.925
and blow shit up with
some red-soda-can bomb.

01:20:48.010 --> 01:20:49.594
Just give it to us,
turtleneck.

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:52.096
Yeah, okay,
you can have it back.

01:20:52.264 --> 01:20:55.266
As long as that sack over there
comes and takes it from me.

01:20:56.435 --> 01:20:58.019
- I think he's talking about you.
- He's talking about you.

01:20:58.103 --> 01:20:59.604
He's obviously
talking about me.

01:21:02.983 --> 01:21:04.317
Blaine, hello.

01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:05.943
Um...

01:21:06.278 --> 01:21:08.196
Can I please
get the soda back?

01:21:08.364 --> 01:21:09.614
Yeah, sure you can.

01:21:10.616 --> 01:21:11.616
Oh.

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:12.950
Okay.

01:21:15.204 --> 01:21:16.871
Fuck me in the face.

01:21:16.955 --> 01:21:18.623
Get him
a body bag, Blaine!

01:21:18.999 --> 01:21:21.376
Give us a minute, okay?
Listen to me, man.

01:21:21.794 --> 01:21:26.464
That guy, that guy has pummeled you
again and again.

01:21:26.632 --> 01:21:27.965
He made you
his little bitch.

01:21:28.133 --> 01:21:30.677
He's humiliated you,
emasculated you.

01:21:30.844 --> 01:21:34.347
The wheel of fate has stopped
and dumped you here again,

01:21:34.431 --> 01:21:35.723
utterly defeated.

01:21:36.183 --> 01:21:37.892
None of this is
helping me at all.

01:21:37.976 --> 01:21:39.519
I know, it's coming.
It's coming right now.

01:21:39.603 --> 01:21:40.603
Patience.

01:21:40.688 --> 01:21:42.438
Maybe you're supposed to do
something different.

01:21:42.523 --> 01:21:44.774
What is this, girl talk?
Let's go here, come on.

01:21:44.858 --> 01:21:46.317
You're better than him.

01:21:46.402 --> 01:21:47.652
America!

01:21:47.736 --> 01:21:49.821
Maybe not by a lot,
but a little.

01:21:49.988 --> 01:21:52.490
You're the patron saint
of the totally fucked.

01:21:52.658 --> 01:21:56.160
You're completely toxic.
There's nothing you can't kill.

01:21:56.328 --> 01:21:58.121
You're the fucking Violator!

01:21:58.205 --> 01:21:59.747
The moment's over.
Let's go!

01:21:59.832 --> 01:22:03.167
You can do this!
You can get us the fuck out of here!

01:22:03.335 --> 01:22:04.836
You can be the hero!

01:22:05.003 --> 01:22:06.587
Enrique-fucking-lglesias.

01:22:06.672 --> 01:22:08.089
You love that song,
don't you?

01:22:08.173 --> 01:22:09.924
I love that fucking song!

01:22:10.008 --> 01:22:11.843
Give me your best shot.
Come on, buddy.

01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:16.139
¢Ü I can be your hero, baby ¢Ü

01:22:18.976 --> 01:22:22.437
¢Ü I can kiss away the pain ¢Ü

01:22:25.107 --> 01:22:28.901
¢Ü I will stand by you forever ¢Ü

01:22:30.779 --> 01:22:35.450
¢Ü You can take my breath away ¢Ü

01:22:36.368 --> 01:22:37.785
Shit.

01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:41.330
God damn it!
None of what you said worked at all.

01:22:42.207 --> 01:22:44.167
Let's kick these guys' ass,
get the shit and go home.

01:22:44.251 --> 01:22:45.293
Done.

01:22:45.377 --> 01:22:46.711
No, no!

01:22:54.762 --> 01:22:57.263
Fuck you! Feels so good!

01:22:57.431 --> 01:22:58.639
The Chernobly.

01:23:09.151 --> 01:23:10.651
Martina Navratilova.

01:23:10.736 --> 01:23:12.069
Smirnoff Ice.

01:23:14.406 --> 01:23:16.365
That's right,
we are Russians! Spies.

01:23:17.242 --> 01:23:18.826
Yeah, because I was
just speaking Russian.

01:23:18.911 --> 01:23:21.579
He pulls that top,
and this whole fucking place blows.

01:23:21.747 --> 01:23:25.541
You guys count backwards from 50,
then pull up the carpet and jump around.

01:23:25.709 --> 01:23:27.251
Or I'll fuck you up.

01:23:31.256 --> 01:23:34.258
Hi, Phil.
Can we go back to the hotel, lodge?

01:23:34.426 --> 01:23:36.093
- Sure.
- Thank you so much.

01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:40.348
Five, four, three...

01:23:40.432 --> 01:23:42.808
Blaine, please stop counting.

01:23:42.893 --> 01:23:46.020
Chaz, this is
an Acorn 5 situation.

01:23:46.104 --> 01:23:48.481
If we stop counting,
they're gonna blow us sky-high.

01:23:48.565 --> 01:23:51.359
Look, if it is a bomb,
they've got it with them, all right?

01:23:51.443 --> 01:23:52.693
If anyone's gonna blow up,
it's them.

01:23:52.778 --> 01:23:54.278
Chaz, stop!

01:23:55.948 --> 01:23:57.406
How long did
our talking just take?

01:23:57.491 --> 01:23:58.741
I don't know.
I wasn't keeping track.

01:23:58.825 --> 01:24:00.785
Fuck it, let's risk it!

01:24:00.869 --> 01:24:01.869
Move out!

01:24:02.412 --> 01:24:04.997
Now that you're with me,
you gotta cover up your belly.

01:24:05.082 --> 01:24:06.290
Let's get
the fuck out of here.

01:24:06.375 --> 01:24:08.251
What are you talking about?
We only had sex once.

01:24:08.335 --> 01:24:10.628
Let's go. Come on.
Kelly, you can
talk about it later.

01:24:10.712 --> 01:24:11.712
You guys are all right?

01:24:11.797 --> 01:24:13.214
Thank you, Phil.
Enjoyed it.

01:24:13.298 --> 01:24:15.466
Have a good rest
of your vacation.

01:24:15.551 --> 01:24:19.220
We'd love to have you come back here
to the Silver Peaks Lodge.

01:24:19.304 --> 01:24:21.389
- Thanks. Bye-bye.
- Thanks, Phil. Take care.

01:24:21.473 --> 01:24:22.557
Be careful.

01:24:22.641 --> 01:24:23.599
Hey, watch out!

01:24:26.061 --> 01:24:28.563
God, you guys see that?

01:24:28.647 --> 01:24:30.231
Come on, man!

01:24:30.315 --> 01:24:32.066
Why would you
fucking take that from me?

01:24:32.150 --> 01:24:33.859
I didn't take it from you.

01:24:33.944 --> 01:24:35.278
You guys...

01:24:37.739 --> 01:24:40.575
It happened!
It happened!

01:24:44.871 --> 01:24:47.999
Why the fuck
are you laughing? Gross!

01:24:50.836 --> 01:24:52.962
Man down, man down!
Code 11.

01:24:53.046 --> 01:24:55.840
All right, everybody grab your gear,
we gotta move!

01:24:57.843 --> 01:24:59.176
Later, Kelly.

01:24:59.761 --> 01:25:02.221
Bye, Mom. Love you.
Don't do drugs, okay?

01:25:02.306 --> 01:25:03.723
Hey, bye.

01:25:04.975 --> 01:25:06.100
Aren't you coming
to my room with me?

01:25:06.184 --> 01:25:07.226
No, I gotta take
my clothes off

01:25:07.311 --> 01:25:09.103
and get in a hot
tub with these guys.

01:25:09.521 --> 01:25:10.771
Then I'm totally
over you.

01:25:10.856 --> 01:25:12.857
Kelly, listen.
It's been an interesting trip.

01:25:12.941 --> 01:25:15.234
You're my sister
and I love you.

01:25:15.569 --> 01:25:17.194
I love you, too.

01:25:17.446 --> 01:25:19.697
And don't steal
that Caboodle makeup thing from JCPenney

01:25:19.781 --> 01:25:21.073
and you won't do
any hard time.

01:25:21.158 --> 01:25:22.742
I'll see you in 20 years.

01:25:23.035 --> 01:25:25.703
Uh. You're giving me a ride
in the morning, right?

01:25:28.707 --> 01:25:30.082
Hallelujah!

01:25:31.293 --> 01:25:32.793
Cannonball!

01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:37.548
Yeah! Let's get
this party started!

01:25:38.050 --> 01:25:39.467
Young blood.

01:25:43.388 --> 01:25:44.388
Holy shit!

01:25:44.473 --> 01:25:45.640
Hey, look,
it's happening.

01:25:46.058 --> 01:25:47.516
Here it comes!

01:25:50.062 --> 01:25:52.855
Hurry up.
I can see the '90s.

01:25:52.939 --> 01:25:54.565
Why are you taking
off your clothes?

01:25:54.650 --> 01:25:56.817
I don't know, man.
It just feels right, you know?

01:25:56.902 --> 01:25:58.027
Fuck it.

01:25:58.236 --> 01:26:02.156
Adam! Adam!
I'm not gonna go!

01:26:02.741 --> 01:26:04.617
- What?
- I'm gonna stay!

01:26:04.701 --> 01:26:06.744
Don't fuck around, Lou.
Let's go!

01:26:07.245 --> 01:26:08.996
I'm good here, man.

01:26:09.081 --> 01:26:12.750
I had a good day!
I beat the shit out of that guy, finally!

01:26:13.001 --> 01:26:14.502
I fucked your sister!

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:16.712
I could be a good dad!

01:26:16.797 --> 01:26:18.506
I love you, Jacob!

01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:20.091
Fuck you!

01:26:21.385 --> 01:26:24.804
Little scamp. They say
the damndest things, man.

01:26:24.888 --> 01:26:27.765
Come on, Lou, let's go!
We'll talk about it when we get home!

01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:30.393
I was trying
to kill myself!

01:26:33.021 --> 01:26:35.314
I know, man.
That's why we came here!

01:26:35.399 --> 01:26:40.152
If I go back, I'm just
gonna kill myself all over again, man.

01:26:40.237 --> 01:26:42.113
- I can't.
- You're gonna stay?

01:26:42.364 --> 01:26:43.948
Guys, let's go.

01:26:44.032 --> 01:26:45.700
All right, well, if you're gonna stay,
I'm gonna stay!

01:26:45.784 --> 01:26:47.326
You'd really
do that for me?

01:26:47.411 --> 01:26:50.287
We're best friends!
If you're staying, I'm staying!

01:26:50.372 --> 01:26:52.164
Your bullshit's
my bullshit, right?

01:26:52.541 --> 01:26:54.125
I'm your best friend?

01:26:54.209 --> 01:26:56.168
You are one of
my best friends!

01:26:56.253 --> 01:26:57.211
I'll take that!

01:26:57.295 --> 01:26:58.587
Where you going on me?

01:26:58.672 --> 01:26:59.755
Thank you!

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:01.048
Oh, my God!

01:27:01.675 --> 01:27:03.551
All right, man. Come on!

01:27:47.095 --> 01:27:48.512
Holy shit.

01:27:48.930 --> 01:27:51.682
This better be the last time
my ass travels through time.

01:28:13.371 --> 01:28:14.413
Oh...

01:28:15.123 --> 01:28:17.291
It is so good
to see you.

01:28:19.628 --> 01:28:20.920
<i>Are we rolling?</i>

01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:24.048
<i>Welcome back, bitches!</i>

01:28:24.216 --> 01:28:25.382
Is that Lou?

01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:27.968
What took you so long?
All right, zoom out.

01:28:28.053 --> 01:28:29.553
Yeah, that's
a weird hair choice.

01:28:29.638 --> 01:28:32.223
Uh-oh. Look what Daddy did.

01:28:32.474 --> 01:28:33.557
He looks like a lion.

01:28:34.726 --> 01:28:36.811
Oh, hi.
Didn't see you there.

01:28:37.729 --> 01:28:38.729
Here's a question.

01:28:38.814 --> 01:28:41.816
Was it morally wrong for me
to exploit my knowledge of the future

01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:43.651
for personal financial gain?

01:28:43.735 --> 01:28:45.069
Perhaps.

01:28:45.153 --> 01:28:46.695
Here's another question.

01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:48.280
Do I give a fuck?

01:28:48.365 --> 01:28:49.406
That's my father.

01:28:49.491 --> 01:28:51.659
Hey, check out my girl.

01:28:51.743 --> 01:28:53.494
You burned the fucking crab
cakes again.

01:28:53.578 --> 01:28:57.039
<i>No, I didn't burn them
because I like them that way!</i>

01:28:57.123 --> 01:28:59.083
I fucking hate you, Louis.

01:28:59.167 --> 01:29:00.501
I hate you, too, baby.

01:29:01.419 --> 01:29:03.003
I love that woman, man.

01:29:03.088 --> 01:29:04.630
Those are my parents.

01:29:04.714 --> 01:29:06.507
But seriously,
a lot has changed.

01:29:06.591 --> 01:29:10.636
So, whatever happens,
stay the fuck calm.

01:29:11.429 --> 01:29:12.847
It'll all make sense soon.

01:29:22.816 --> 01:29:23.858
Good morning.

01:29:23.942 --> 01:29:26.193
Holy shit,
Phil, you got both your arms.

01:29:26.278 --> 01:29:28.112
Oh. Yeah, I do.

01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:29.363
That's incredible.

01:29:29.447 --> 01:29:32.741
Yeah, what happened was
a snowplow came along

01:29:32.826 --> 01:29:34.535
and it took my arm right off.

01:29:34.619 --> 01:29:37.454
<i>But the ski patrol came along
and they put it on ice.</i>

01:29:37.539 --> 01:29:39.832
Blaine and Chaz.
Blaine and Chaz saved his arm!

01:29:39.916 --> 01:29:42.042
We got 15 minutes
before that thing dies, all right.

01:29:42.127 --> 01:29:43.586
We're gonna put
that back on you!

01:29:43.670 --> 01:29:45.254
<i>I'm pretty happy.</i>

01:29:45.338 --> 01:29:46.380
It looks great.

01:29:46.464 --> 01:29:48.883
Anyhow, I have instructions
on how to get home.

01:29:48.967 --> 01:29:50.259
We know how to get home.

01:29:50.343 --> 01:29:51.719
Yeah. We know...

01:29:51.803 --> 01:29:54.638
Mr. Dorchen anticipated
that you might say that,

01:29:54.764 --> 01:29:57.600
so I took the liberty
of printing up some Lougle maps for you.

01:29:57.809 --> 01:29:59.560
- You mean "Google"?
- Lougle maps.

01:29:59.644 --> 01:30:01.770
What's the matter with you guys?

01:30:05.150 --> 01:30:06.275
Fuck me.

01:30:06.359 --> 01:30:09.403
So, Phil, if you wanna find,
you know, like porno

01:30:09.487 --> 01:30:12.281
or a restaurant review
or anything like that, you use Lougle?

01:30:12.532 --> 01:30:13.699
Correct.

01:30:13.992 --> 01:30:16.160
I bet he's on
the Statue of Liberty and shit, too.

01:30:20.498 --> 01:30:22.124
You want me to go in there?

01:30:22.208 --> 01:30:24.460
That's what
it says on the map.

01:30:27.047 --> 01:30:28.255
Call me later.

01:30:31.009 --> 01:30:32.134
Hello.

01:30:36.806 --> 01:30:38.891
Welcome back, Mr. Webber.
How was your time away?

01:30:40.685 --> 01:30:41.810
Uh...

01:30:43.647 --> 01:30:46.732
Hey, how was the trip?

01:30:51.529 --> 01:30:52.696
Good.

01:30:53.031 --> 01:30:55.157
¢Ü Letting the days go by ¢Ü

01:30:55.241 --> 01:30:57.326
¢Ü Let the water hold me down ¢Ü

01:30:57.410 --> 01:30:59.286
¢Ü Letting the days go by ¢Ü

01:30:59.371 --> 01:31:01.455
¢Ü Water flowing underground ¢Ü

01:31:01.539 --> 01:31:03.499
¢Ü Into the blue again ¢Ü

01:31:03.583 --> 01:31:05.459
¢Ü After the money's gone ¢Ü

01:31:05.543 --> 01:31:07.503
¢Ü Once in a lifetime ¢Ü

01:31:07.587 --> 01:31:10.339
¢Ü Water flowing underground ¢Ü

01:31:10.423 --> 01:31:11.715
Motherfucker.

01:31:12.884 --> 01:31:14.051
Nick?

01:31:14.511 --> 01:31:17.721
Baby, how was your weekend?
I wasn't expecting you today.

01:31:19.599 --> 01:31:22.559
Baby. Baby.
I got something to tell you.

01:31:22.894 --> 01:31:25.688
I know about what you did
with a guy named Steve.

01:31:26.898 --> 01:31:29.608
Steve?
Our receptionist?

01:31:29.776 --> 01:31:31.735
That Tyrese-looking
motherfucker out there?

01:31:31.903 --> 01:31:35.072
Baby, wait a minute.
What are you talking about?

01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:36.824
You think I'm fooling around?

01:31:36.908 --> 01:31:39.702
First of all, I would never screw around.

01:31:40.078 --> 01:31:43.789
And you remember I told you about that crazy
wrong number I got when I was nine.

01:31:43.873 --> 01:31:45.374
- That man was so...
- I love you, Courtney.

01:31:45.458 --> 01:31:47.167
I love you so much.

01:31:47.252 --> 01:31:49.378
I love you, too,
Nick Webber.

01:31:50.088 --> 01:31:51.296
Nick Webber?

01:31:52.090 --> 01:31:53.257
That's your name.

01:31:54.384 --> 01:31:56.093
Yeah, it is my name.

01:31:56.678 --> 01:31:57.678
Yeah.

01:31:57.762 --> 01:31:59.930
You know my name.
Say it again.

01:32:00.015 --> 01:32:01.181
Nick

01:32:01.266 --> 01:32:02.683
- Webber.
- Yeah.

01:32:03.727 --> 01:32:05.602
Grab that.
I'll take this one.

01:32:06.104 --> 01:32:07.896
Hey, Mom.
I made you a drink.

01:32:08.189 --> 01:32:09.690
Is there alcohol in that?

01:32:09.774 --> 01:32:11.442
Yeah, I believe
there's still alcohol in scotch.

01:32:13.486 --> 01:32:14.987
Talk about your
lost weekend, huh?

01:32:15.071 --> 01:32:16.947
I know, right? Man.

01:32:17.657 --> 01:32:19.658
Hey, family.

01:32:20.952 --> 01:32:22.578
What are you faggots talking about?

01:32:22.746 --> 01:32:24.621
My two handsome men.

01:32:24.789 --> 01:32:26.707
Let me get you another drink, Dad.

01:32:27.459 --> 01:32:29.084
Daddy's little buddy.

01:32:30.795 --> 01:32:32.421
You know what I can't believe?

01:32:32.797 --> 01:32:34.423
I can't believe we're all here.

01:32:34.591 --> 01:32:36.133
I can't believe we all made it.

01:32:36.634 --> 01:32:37.801
Made it together.

01:32:38.136 --> 01:32:39.470
- A toast.
- A toast.

01:32:39.554 --> 01:32:41.889
Approximately three days ago, or 20 years,

01:32:41.973 --> 01:32:44.808
depending on your understanding
of the time-space continuum, Jacob,

01:32:45.852 --> 01:32:48.520
sitting here with you guys
would have been my worst nightmare.

01:32:48.605 --> 01:32:49.855
It's true.

01:32:49.939 --> 01:32:51.774
But I can honestly say right now

01:32:52.233 --> 01:32:56.070
I'm very happy to be right here
in this moment with you,

01:32:56.446 --> 01:32:57.988
- my best friends.
- Hear, hear.

01:32:58.073 --> 01:32:59.114
To friends.

01:32:59.199 --> 01:33:00.240
And family.

01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:01.825
All right. Cheers!

01:33:01.993 --> 01:33:03.368
To past, present and future.

01:33:03.661 --> 01:33:05.412
Cheers!

01:33:05.497 --> 01:33:06.455
So, "Lougle," huh?

01:33:06.539 --> 01:33:07.581
Yeah.

01:33:07.665 --> 01:33:11.001
Lougle. Just this multibillion-dollar
thing I did for a while.

01:33:11.795 --> 01:33:15.005
My real passion's music, though.
So pissed the band broke up.

01:33:15.173 --> 01:33:17.508
Band? What band
were you ever in?

01:33:29.312 --> 01:33:32.689
¢Ü You know I'm a dreamer ¢Ü

01:33:32.857 --> 01:33:36.068
¢Ü But my heart's of gold ¢Ü

01:33:36.319 --> 01:33:39.279
¢Ü I had to run away high ¢Ü

01:33:39.364 --> 01:33:41.907
¢Ü So I wouldn't come home low ¢Ü

01:33:42.033 --> 01:33:45.119
¢Ü Just when things went right ¢Ü

01:33:45.203 --> 01:33:48.122
¢Ü Doesn't mean
they were always wrong ¢Ü

01:33:48.456 --> 01:33:52.668
¢Ü Just take this song
and you'll never feel ¢Ü

01:33:52.836 --> 01:33:54.711
¢Ü Left all alone ¢Ü

01:33:54.796 --> 01:33:57.840
¢Ü Take me to your heart ¢Ü

01:33:58.174 --> 01:34:00.801
¢Ü Feel me in your bones ¢Ü

01:34:00.885 --> 01:34:03.048
¢Ü Just one more night ¢Ü

01:34:03.049 --> 01:34:07.850
¢Ü And I'm coming off this
long and winding road ¢Ü

01:34:10.854 --> 01:34:16.525
¢Ü I'm on my way ¢Ü

01:34:16.609 --> 01:34:20.070
¢Ü Home sweet home ¢Ü

01:34:21.072 --> 01:34:23.323
¢Ü Tonight, tonight ¢Ü

01:34:23.491 --> 01:34:28.996
¢Ü I'm on my way ¢Ü

01:34:29.205 --> 01:34:32.249
¢Ü Home sweet home ¢Ü

01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:38.881
¢Ü You know that I've seen ¢Ü

01:34:39.048 --> 01:34:41.675
¢Ü Too many romantic dreams ¢Ü

01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:43.927
¢Ü Up in lights ¢Ü

01:34:44.012 --> 01:34:47.723
¢Ü falling off the silver screen ¢Ü

01:34:48.391 --> 01:34:50.851
¢Ü My heart's like an open book ¢Ü

01:34:51.269 --> 01:34:54.062
¢Ü For the whole world to read ¢Ü

01:34:54.522 --> 01:34:58.692
¢Ü Sometimes nothing keeps me together ¢Ü

01:34:58.776 --> 01:35:00.527
¢Ü at the seams ¢Ü

01:35:00.612 --> 01:35:06.533
¢Ü I'm on my way ¢Ü

01:35:06.618 --> 01:35:10.370
¢Ü Home sweet home ¢Ü

01:35:11.456 --> 01:35:12.706
¢Ü Yeah ¢Ü

01:35:13.625 --> 01:35:16.126
¢Ü I'm on my way ¢Ü

01:35:16.294 --> 01:35:18.962
¢Ü Just set me free ¢Ü

01:35:19.130 --> 01:35:24.134
¢Ü Home sweet home ¢Ü
