00:00.020 --> 00:02.023
Previously on
"devious maids"...

00:02.488 --> 00:05.156
Beverly Hills is under attack.

00:08.227 --> 00:10.361
His aunt got the house,
and it's gonna be sold.

00:10.396 --> 00:13.598
How can they just kick us out?
Where are we supposed to go?

00:13.632 --> 00:15.667
You still dating
richie mctrust fund?

00:15.701 --> 00:18.369
His name is Remi.
And we broke up.

00:18.404 --> 00:20.872
I know we fought a lot
those last couple of weeks,

00:20.906 --> 00:22.440
but... but that doesn't mean
that we ha...

00:22.474 --> 00:24.275
Yeah. It does.

00:24.309 --> 00:25.843
Don't move!

00:25.878 --> 00:27.278
I haven't slept in days.

00:27.312 --> 00:31.549
I realize you're still
traumatized by the break-in,

00:31.583 --> 00:33.184
but you are going to get help.

00:33.218 --> 00:35.219
Well, this woman
I'm interested in is married,

00:35.254 --> 00:38.423
maybe her husband
is falling apart

00:38.457 --> 00:41.292
and she is desperately in need
of a strong man like you.

00:43.462 --> 00:46.097
If you see Rosie again,
even one more time,

00:46.131 --> 00:47.432
I will destroy you.

00:47.466 --> 00:49.400
I just wanted to see
if you were okay.

00:49.435 --> 00:50.868
You have to stay away.

00:50.903 --> 00:52.370
You'll be taking care
of my Uncle Ken.

00:52.404 --> 00:53.705
He recently had a stroke.

00:53.739 --> 00:56.274
Get a keyboard in front of him.
See if he can type.

00:56.308 --> 00:59.544
Zoila, if I stay in this house,
the way I'm feeling about you,

00:59.578 --> 01:01.279
we're not gonna make it.

01:01.313 --> 01:04.382
I'm not Pablo.
I will never leave you.

01:04.416 --> 01:06.384
You're gonna stay here
for a while.

01:06.418 --> 01:08.786
- No more secrets.
- I promise.

01:08.821 --> 01:11.456
Will she still love you
when she finds out what you did?

01:11.490 --> 01:12.724
She better not.

01:12.791 --> 01:15.660
Did Dahlia ever...
Talk about her maid?

01:15.694 --> 01:16.928
There have been rumors.

01:16.962 --> 01:19.997
Are you suggesting that
Opal and Nicholas had an affair?

01:20.032 --> 01:22.100
Most women crave
companionship.

01:22.134 --> 01:23.968
- No, not my mom.
- Well, what about your dad?

01:24.002 --> 01:25.403
I don't know who my father is.

01:25.437 --> 01:27.071
For years,
I begged my mom to tell me,

01:27.106 --> 01:29.617
but she said it was better
for everyone if I didn't know.

01:39.451 --> 01:42.419
Honey, stop blinking.

01:42.454 --> 01:44.588
These fake eyelashes
itch like crazy.

01:44.623 --> 01:46.924
Are we sure all of this
is necessary?

01:46.958 --> 01:49.093
You haven't seen Pablo
in weeks.

01:49.127 --> 01:52.563
You must remind him of what
he's been missing.

01:53.510 --> 01:55.566
He called me.

01:55.600 --> 01:57.534
I think he's ready
for reconciliation.

01:57.569 --> 01:59.870
All the more reason to use
a few tricks of the trade.

01:59.904 --> 02:02.640
Stun him with your beauty,
then seal the deal.

02:02.674 --> 02:04.174
He's here.

02:04.242 --> 02:05.609
Wait.
We're not finished.

02:07.012 --> 02:09.246
What are you doing?

02:09.281 --> 02:10.580
Trust me.

02:10.615 --> 02:12.916
I landed two husbands
with these.

02:12.951 --> 02:15.052
Now go get him.

02:15.086 --> 02:16.720
Okay.

02:20.492 --> 02:23.460
Hola, cariÃ±o.

02:23.495 --> 02:26.630
Wow.

02:26.665 --> 02:27.865
You look amazing.

02:27.899 --> 02:32.236
Eh. Just a regular Friday.
Come on in.

02:36.608 --> 02:40.077
So... what's going on?

02:40.111 --> 02:43.247
Tito's graduation party
is next week.

02:43.281 --> 02:44.348
Are you going?

02:44.382 --> 02:47.117
He's our godson.
Sure, I'm going.

02:47.185 --> 02:49.653
Me, too.

02:49.688 --> 02:52.323
Uh...
I was wondering...

02:52.357 --> 02:55.159
If we could go together?
Why not?

02:55.226 --> 02:57.528
I think it'd be fun.

02:57.562 --> 03:01.165
Actually, I was wondering if...

03:01.199 --> 03:03.667
Tito told you
I'm bringing Helen.

03:05.670 --> 03:07.504
Helen, the woman
you work with?

03:09.074 --> 03:11.308
So, you're seeing someone?

03:11.343 --> 03:13.177
Zoila, come on.

03:13.211 --> 03:15.713
- We're separated.
- Ugh, my God.

03:17.749 --> 03:19.616
This is what people do!

03:19.651 --> 03:21.118
No, no.

03:21.152 --> 03:22.186
Most married men

03:22.220 --> 03:26.657
don't bring a girlfriend
to family functions!

03:26.691 --> 03:29.460
I'm sorry. I...
Helen wants to meet my family.

03:29.494 --> 03:30.694
Wait!

03:30.729 --> 03:33.464
Were you seeing her
before you moved out?

03:33.498 --> 03:36.467
We were just good friends...
Mostly.

03:36.501 --> 03:38.802
Ohh. Oh, my God.

03:38.837 --> 03:41.472
Oh, my God.

03:41.506 --> 03:43.340
How many body parts
are you gonna take off?

03:43.375 --> 03:45.042
Just one more,
and it's gonna be yours!

03:45.076 --> 03:46.710
Okay, l-let's not
get hostile.

03:46.745 --> 03:47.711
You want to see hostile?

03:47.746 --> 03:50.881
- This is hostile!
- Zoila!

03:50.915 --> 03:53.384
Hey!

03:55.770 --> 04:01.510
<b>- sync and corrections by Zac -
</b>

04:03.736 --> 04:06.563
Fans around the world
continue to mourn

04:06.598 --> 04:09.566
the tragic death
of singer Alejandro Rubio.

04:09.601 --> 04:12.403
In a sad twist,
one young fan attempted suicide

04:12.437 --> 04:14.338
outside Rubio's
Beverly Hills home.

04:14.372 --> 04:17.836
The teenager is recovering
at a local hospital.

04:17.870 --> 04:19.491
What are you doing?

04:19.978 --> 04:23.847
It's almost 4:00. You promised
Dr. Welch you'd be on time today.

04:23.882 --> 04:26.450
I don't want to go.
I hate therapy.

04:26.484 --> 04:28.852
Why?

04:28.887 --> 04:33.357
Every session, he makes me talk
about my sexual problems.

04:33.391 --> 04:35.859
And you feel an hour
isn't long enough?

04:35.894 --> 04:39.696
I think my problems
stem from childhood.

04:39.731 --> 04:41.031
When I was 5...

04:41.065 --> 04:45.202
Adrian... Dr. Welch
cares enough to listen.

04:45.236 --> 04:46.503
I do not, so...

04:58.750 --> 05:00.050
He's gone.

05:00.084 --> 05:02.886
- Take off your pants.
- Excuse me?

05:02.921 --> 05:04.721
My husband just left.

05:04.756 --> 05:06.723
Now, we've got
very little time,

05:06.758 --> 05:08.392
and there's lots
I want to accomplish.

05:08.426 --> 05:10.294
So, you've been thinking about
our last time together?

05:10.328 --> 05:14.064
You gave me seven orgasms
in one afternoon.

05:14.098 --> 05:17.801
It is safe to say you've
crossed my mind once or twice.

05:20.939 --> 05:24.241
Is that...? No! No.
He went to therapy.

05:24.275 --> 05:26.343
Tony? It's Adrian.

05:27.912 --> 05:29.746
Tony, you decent?
Whoa!

05:29.781 --> 05:32.683
Mr. Powell!
I thought you were at therapy.

05:32.717 --> 05:34.184
Well, I was on my way
when I remembered

05:34.219 --> 05:36.186
how hard it is to find parking,
thought you could drive.

05:36.221 --> 05:38.322
If you like.

05:38.356 --> 05:39.990
You know, for a moment,

05:40.024 --> 05:41.625
I thought you might
have a girl in here.

05:41.659 --> 05:44.094
Now, why would you think that?

05:44.128 --> 05:45.329
I thought I heard voices.

05:45.363 --> 05:50.000
Yes, well, that was...

05:50.034 --> 05:51.768
Porn.

05:51.803 --> 05:53.604
You watch porn?

05:53.638 --> 05:55.272
Constantly.

05:55.306 --> 05:56.573
Me, too.

05:56.608 --> 05:58.775
I've got quite a collection.
Happy to share, if you'd like.

05:58.810 --> 06:00.611
- Share?
- Absolutely.

06:00.645 --> 06:02.946
What's mine is yours.

06:04.782 --> 06:06.750
I'll try to remember that.

06:13.925 --> 06:16.326
This firm offered Michael
so much money.

06:16.361 --> 06:18.829
We just had no choice
but to take the job.

06:18.863 --> 06:20.464
But you leave Friday?

06:20.498 --> 06:23.634
I know. It's quick, but we found
some actor to rent our house.

06:23.668 --> 06:25.969
And when we get settled
in D.C.,

06:26.004 --> 06:29.172
Michael says we can finally
start talking about adoption.

06:29.207 --> 06:32.042
Oh, you sound so happy.

06:32.076 --> 06:33.644
I really am.

06:33.678 --> 06:35.879
Hey, I saw the pictures
of Nicholas you sent.

06:35.914 --> 06:38.715
What a hunk.

06:38.750 --> 06:40.651
You must be pretty happy
yourself.

06:43.254 --> 06:45.756
Shall I pour?

06:45.790 --> 06:48.425
Uh, I think we're good.
Thank you.

06:53.431 --> 06:56.567
I'm sorry.
Where were we?

06:56.601 --> 06:58.135
I was asking if you were happy.

06:58.169 --> 07:01.838
Oh. Yeah, right.

07:03.508 --> 07:05.676
I'll pour the tea.

07:05.710 --> 07:08.145
You start talking.

07:11.616 --> 07:14.251
My poor, sad Zoila.

07:14.285 --> 07:15.285
Huh?

07:15.320 --> 07:16.787
The kitchen is spotless,

07:16.821 --> 07:18.622
and that means
you're depressed.

07:18.656 --> 07:21.592
I'm not depressed.
I'm angry.

07:21.659 --> 07:23.627
And this kitchen
is always spotless.

07:23.661 --> 07:25.629
Well, I'm glad you're not sad.

07:25.663 --> 07:28.932
I don't want you walking into
that party with a long face.

07:28.967 --> 07:31.101
I'm not going to the party.

07:31.135 --> 07:33.604
But you've been looking forward

07:33.638 --> 07:36.273
to your godson's graduation
for weeks.

07:36.307 --> 07:38.342
Pablo will be there with Helen.

07:38.376 --> 07:39.810
It will be humiliating.

07:39.844 --> 07:41.812
Not if you show up
with someone.

07:41.846 --> 07:43.046
What?

07:43.081 --> 07:44.214
Think about it.

07:44.248 --> 07:47.084
How delicious would it be
for you to walk in

07:47.118 --> 07:49.953
on the arm of some handsome,
successful man?

07:49.988 --> 07:51.054
Hmm.

07:51.089 --> 07:52.289
Doesn't that sound fun?

07:54.325 --> 07:57.394
And where exactly
am I supposed to find this guy?

07:57.428 --> 07:59.963
I don't know.
A bar? A club?

07:59.998 --> 08:02.633
And you think handsome,
successful men

08:02.667 --> 08:04.334
will come running over
to meet me?

08:04.369 --> 08:07.004
That's why I'm suggesting
venues that serve alcohol.

08:07.038 --> 08:09.172
The party is in two days!

08:09.207 --> 08:13.543
- I'm not gonna find a guy.
- Well, you have to at least try.

08:13.578 --> 08:15.212
You have to show everyone

08:15.246 --> 08:17.814
that you don't need Pablo
to be happy.

08:17.849 --> 08:22.686
But I do.
That's my problem.

08:28.639 --> 08:32.395
You honestly think Nicholas was
having an affair with Opal?

08:32.429 --> 08:33.764
I don't know.

08:33.798 --> 08:36.366
The evidence I have
is sketchy at best.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.201
Are you worried
that it's still going on?

08:38.236 --> 08:39.703
Not really.

08:39.736 --> 08:43.340
But he continues
to let her live here. Why?

08:43.374 --> 08:46.009
If Ethan was the product

08:46.044 --> 08:47.811
of some ancient
one-night stand,

08:47.845 --> 08:49.546
that would at least make sense.

08:49.580 --> 08:52.549
If he is Ethan's father,
Nicholas would have set up

08:52.583 --> 08:55.385
some sort of
financial situation for him.

08:55.420 --> 08:58.889
Did you see anything suspicious
in his financial records?

09:00.425 --> 09:01.858
I've never seen any of those.

09:01.893 --> 09:03.126
Oh, your lawyer must have.

09:03.161 --> 09:07.064
You know, when he was finalizing
the prenup.

09:07.098 --> 09:09.499
Nick didn't ask for a prenup.

09:09.534 --> 09:13.970
- He didn't?
- He said it wasn't romantic,

09:14.038 --> 09:15.839
that he trusted me.

09:15.873 --> 09:20.510
Well, that's too bad,
because if he didn't trust you,

09:20.545 --> 09:23.780
it'd be a lot easier for you
to trust him.

09:31.889 --> 09:33.690
Hello? Hey, Zoila.

09:33.725 --> 09:36.693
No, I'm at a job interview,
to be a maid.

09:36.728 --> 09:40.564
I know I said I didn't want to
do it anymore, but I am broke.

09:40.598 --> 09:42.232
Well, I'm afraid
it's not gonna work out.

09:42.266 --> 09:43.400
Got to go.

09:43.434 --> 09:44.634
The agency should have told you

09:44.669 --> 09:47.204
I was looking for a live-in,
but thank you for coming.

09:49.140 --> 09:50.607
Well, so, here's the good news.

09:50.641 --> 09:52.342
The position
hasn't been filled yet.

09:52.376 --> 09:54.111
The bad news is
I'm getting desperate.

09:54.145 --> 09:56.813
Now, who'd like to go first?
How about you?

09:57.130 --> 09:58.756
_

09:58.757 --> 10:00.978
_

10:01.385 --> 10:02.686
Yes, yes, I've heard about you,

10:02.720 --> 10:04.621
and, Delmi, don't worry about
the language barrier.

10:04.655 --> 10:06.757
I can... I can overlook that,
especially since you worked

10:06.791 --> 10:09.960
all those years
for the Peruvian ambassador.

10:09.994 --> 10:12.362
Well, do you have any questions
before we start?

10:13.765 --> 10:16.900
You know, uh...
Questiones.

10:19.570 --> 10:22.539
I can translate, if you like.

10:22.573 --> 10:24.207
Oh, you'd be willing
to do that?

10:24.242 --> 10:26.643
It will be my pleasure.

10:26.677 --> 10:29.880
Your resume's very impressive.

10:30.696 --> 10:32.082
_

10:33.685 --> 10:34.825
_

10:34.860 --> 10:36.553
She says, "thank you."

10:36.587 --> 10:38.221
I know you're
an amazing housekeeper.

10:38.256 --> 10:39.489
Do you also cook?

10:40.106 --> 10:41.540
_

10:41.541 --> 10:43.978
_

10:44.431 --> 10:46.263
_

10:47.331 --> 10:51.067
- Is there a problem?
- She hates cooking.

10:51.102 --> 10:52.903
Oh. Okay.

10:52.937 --> 10:54.905
Uh, well, I'd like you
to work on the weekends.

10:54.939 --> 10:56.072
Would that be a problem?

10:57.088 --> 10:59.450
_

10:59.451 --> 11:01.817
_

11:02.376 --> 11:04.434
_

11:04.849 --> 11:07.818
She refuses to work
on weekends.

11:07.852 --> 11:09.820
Okay.

11:09.854 --> 11:13.056
Well, uh... does she at least
do windows?

11:13.293 --> 11:15.326
_

11:15.327 --> 11:18.872
_

11:19.175 --> 11:20.947
_

11:22.185 --> 11:23.622
_

11:23.623 --> 11:25.059
_

11:28.172 --> 11:32.442
She hates doing windows.
Personally, I love it.

11:39.539 --> 11:41.339
Oh.

11:41.374 --> 11:43.508
Look!
Someone sent me flowers.

11:43.543 --> 11:44.743
Who?

11:44.811 --> 11:47.079
I have to read the card
in private.

11:47.113 --> 11:50.282
Sometimes, my admirers pay me
the most indecent compliments.

11:52.251 --> 11:53.718
So, what happened to Floyd?

11:53.753 --> 11:55.053
He always brings us
our flowers.

11:55.088 --> 11:56.588
Oh, he got the flu.

11:56.622 --> 11:58.290
I'm Dave grant.
I own the flower shop.

11:58.324 --> 12:00.725
Oh, well, in that case...

12:00.760 --> 12:02.461
And you are?

12:02.495 --> 12:04.429
- Zoila.
- Ah.

12:04.464 --> 12:07.065
I like it when lovely women
have lovely names.

12:07.100 --> 12:10.936
Fine, you can have the tip back.

12:10.970 --> 12:13.805
You know, what I really want
is to have dinner with you.

12:13.840 --> 12:16.408
Are you serious?

12:16.442 --> 12:18.043
Yeah.

12:18.077 --> 12:20.712
Um...

12:20.746 --> 12:22.314
I don't think so.

12:22.348 --> 12:25.817
Zoila! Can you come
in the kitchen?

12:25.852 --> 12:27.719
I seem to have started a fire!

12:27.753 --> 12:29.588
What?!

12:31.390 --> 12:34.025
A small fire.
She'll be right back.

12:36.423 --> 12:39.431
- What is going on?
- I heard him ask you out.

12:39.465 --> 12:41.500
Why not take him
to Tito's party?

12:41.534 --> 12:43.468
Because I don't know
anything about him.

12:43.503 --> 12:46.238
You know he thinks you're
lovely... even in that ugly top.

12:46.272 --> 12:47.806
You gave me this top.

12:47.840 --> 12:50.842
To tear into rags for cleaning.
Didn't you read the card?

12:50.877 --> 12:52.144
Oh, I don't know.

12:52.178 --> 12:55.347
Dave seems nice, but I'd just be
using him to hurt Pablo,

12:55.381 --> 12:57.249
and that doesn't seem right.

12:57.283 --> 13:01.253
Zoila, this is the answer
to our prayers.

13:01.287 --> 13:03.622
God has sent you a handsome,
successful man

13:03.656 --> 13:07.192
you can use to torture
and torment your husband.

13:07.226 --> 13:10.061
Do not reject this gift
from above.

13:10.096 --> 13:14.065
Well... I do try to be
a good catholic.

13:16.102 --> 13:17.569
Oh, Dave!

13:22.241 --> 13:25.377
Hey, Mr. Ken.

13:25.411 --> 13:27.112
Sorry to interrupt,

13:27.146 --> 13:29.447
but it's time
for your barley soup.

13:29.482 --> 13:32.450
Rosie, I cannot get over
how fast he's typing.

13:32.485 --> 13:35.387
I know.
His therapy's working.

13:35.421 --> 13:36.855
Here we go.

13:36.889 --> 13:39.958
Must be nice to finally know
what my Uncle's thinking.

13:43.196 --> 13:45.997
Yes.
We have a lot of fun.

13:46.032 --> 13:48.900
Well, I think what you've done
for him is amazing.

13:50.570 --> 13:52.170
If I could show my appreciation

13:52.205 --> 13:54.172
by taking you out
to dinner sometime...?

13:54.207 --> 13:57.075
You don't got to do that.

13:57.109 --> 14:00.478
I want to.
You... you work so hard.

14:00.513 --> 14:02.247
Not really.

14:02.281 --> 14:04.649
I-I like to take care
of people.

14:04.684 --> 14:05.750
But thank you.

14:05.785 --> 14:08.253
Well, it was...
It was just a thought.

14:09.288 --> 14:12.257
I-I-I should get back
to work.

14:12.291 --> 14:15.894
Um, I'll...
See you two later.

14:15.928 --> 14:19.965
So, you ready for more soup?

14:21.467 --> 14:25.036
Why am I stupid?

14:28.741 --> 14:31.042
I know.

14:31.077 --> 14:33.278
But I can't date
Mr. Reggie.

14:35.982 --> 14:38.116
No.

14:38.150 --> 14:41.186
Your nephew's very handsome.

14:44.557 --> 14:46.625
I am very busy.

14:46.659 --> 14:50.829
I have to take care of you
and my son and this house.

14:55.167 --> 14:57.936
What do I need a man for?

14:59.472 --> 15:02.607
Mr. Kenneth!

15:02.642 --> 15:05.877
You got naughty fingers.

15:08.481 --> 15:12.684
So, this is a fun date, right?

15:12.718 --> 15:15.887
You, me,
a couple of overpriced lattes.

15:15.921 --> 15:18.023
Eh. It's all right.

15:18.057 --> 15:20.525
You're still making me
work for it. Okay.

15:20.559 --> 15:23.728
I guess I'll have to haul out
some sexist compliments.

15:23.763 --> 15:25.430
Like what?

15:25.464 --> 15:27.132
Like "you're gorgeous."

15:27.166 --> 15:29.467
- Shut up.
- You are.

15:29.502 --> 15:31.136
Why aren't you a model?

15:31.170 --> 15:34.606
Because I... don't want to wear
clothes for a living.

15:34.674 --> 15:36.508
I want to design them.

15:36.542 --> 15:38.543
Oh. S-so you're
into fashion?

15:38.577 --> 15:39.944
I am.

15:39.979 --> 15:41.012
Well, cool.

15:41.047 --> 15:42.914
Well, what are you designing
these days?

15:42.948 --> 15:44.983
Nothing lately.

15:45.017 --> 15:46.818
Come on.

15:46.852 --> 15:48.687
You can't call yourself
a designer

15:48.721 --> 15:49.954
if you're not designing.

15:49.989 --> 15:51.122
If you haven't noticed,

15:51.157 --> 15:53.191
cleaning a mansion takes up
a lot of my time.

15:53.225 --> 15:54.859
Play hooky tomorrow.

15:54.894 --> 15:57.028
Mrs. Powell won't notice.

15:57.063 --> 15:58.596
I have to vacuum tomorrow.

15:58.631 --> 16:00.265
Stop making excuses.

16:00.299 --> 16:02.334
You want a dream to come true?
Work at it.

16:02.368 --> 16:06.438
I'll work at it
when I'm ready to, okay?

16:06.472 --> 16:08.940
Sorry.

16:08.974 --> 16:11.943
Just trying to encourage you.

16:11.977 --> 16:14.612
So...

16:16.248 --> 16:18.216
What else can we talk about?

16:18.250 --> 16:20.218
Well, you could tell me
I'm gorgeous.

16:20.252 --> 16:22.520
It's sexist, but it's true.

16:22.555 --> 16:24.322
Shut up!

16:30.863 --> 16:33.998
What are you doing?
Isn't Adrian home?

16:34.033 --> 16:34.999
He's in the bathroom.

16:35.034 --> 16:37.502
I served him cabbage for lunch.

16:37.536 --> 16:40.038
- We've got the next hour to ourselves.
- Evelyn!

16:40.072 --> 16:42.207
Trust me.

16:42.241 --> 16:44.142
The man's bowels are nothing
if not predictable.

16:44.176 --> 16:45.377
We almost got caught last time.

16:45.411 --> 16:48.146
But I need to be with you.

16:48.180 --> 16:50.081
Not while Adrian is
in the house.

16:50.116 --> 16:51.716
But he's always in the house.

16:51.751 --> 16:54.953
Then you better think of a way
to get him out.

17:03.490 --> 17:05.029
I'm worried about you.

17:05.064 --> 17:06.897
Why?

17:06.932 --> 17:09.901
It's been weeks
since the robbery,

17:09.935 --> 17:12.670
and you still seem so fragile.

17:12.704 --> 17:13.838
I do?

17:13.873 --> 17:15.205
Yes.

17:15.241 --> 17:17.842
I was thinking you might benefit
from a trip to sage creek.

17:17.877 --> 17:20.044
Sage creek?
That's a looney bin.

17:20.112 --> 17:21.512
Slash health resort.

17:21.547 --> 17:24.782
- It's filled with crazy people.
- Charming eccentrics...

17:24.849 --> 17:27.252
Like yourself...
Recovering from various traumas.

17:27.286 --> 17:31.589
But my therapist thinks
I'm making great progress here.

17:31.624 --> 17:33.591
You know,
I've started to hate my mother.

17:33.626 --> 17:34.926
Don't you think
you might hate her

17:34.960 --> 17:36.261
more quickly
in a spa-like setting?

17:36.295 --> 17:39.264
No. I need to be home,
with you.

17:39.298 --> 17:41.900
You give me
strength and stability.

17:41.934 --> 17:43.802
Hell, if I had my way,

17:43.836 --> 17:48.500
we'd spend
every waking moment together.

17:55.054 --> 17:56.688
Hey.

17:56.722 --> 17:58.056
What have you been up to?

17:58.090 --> 17:59.123
Nothing much.

17:59.158 --> 18:01.626
Just... making plans
for the wedding.

18:01.660 --> 18:03.928
So much to get done.

18:03.962 --> 18:06.230
We still have to set a date...
Mm-hmm.

18:06.265 --> 18:08.399
And book a church...

18:08.434 --> 18:10.201
And get a prenup.

18:10.235 --> 18:12.537
No, we already talked
about that.

18:12.571 --> 18:14.939
We don't need a prenup.

18:14.973 --> 18:17.008
See, I think we do.

18:17.042 --> 18:18.242
What?

18:18.277 --> 18:21.713
I want you to know that
I don't care about your money.

18:21.747 --> 18:23.881
- I already know that.
- How could you?

18:23.916 --> 18:26.150
We only dated for three months
before you proposed.

18:26.185 --> 18:28.052
And I could tell
you're not a gold digger.

18:28.087 --> 18:29.854
Or so you think.

18:29.888 --> 18:30.922
Huh?

18:30.956 --> 18:33.591
Gold diggers
hide their agendas.

18:33.625 --> 18:35.460
This could be the long con,
my friend.

18:35.494 --> 18:41.099
Maybe I'm out to play you
for everything you're worth.

18:41.133 --> 18:43.301
What is happening here?

18:43.335 --> 18:45.436
I'm just trying to protect you.

18:45.471 --> 18:46.804
Yeah, but I trust you
completely.

18:46.839 --> 18:48.272
See, that is the kind
of attitude

18:48.307 --> 18:49.841
that gets men taken
to the cleaners!

18:49.875 --> 18:51.176
Why are you yelling?

18:51.177 --> 18:52.477
Because you need
to protect yourself!

18:52.511 --> 18:54.011
- From you?
- Yes!

18:56.014 --> 18:58.983
Fine. We'll make
an appointment tomorrow.

18:59.017 --> 19:00.852
Make it now.

19:03.689 --> 19:05.256
Okay.

19:07.793 --> 19:11.996
My lawyer is
never gonna believe this.

19:12.030 --> 19:15.166
Neither is mine.

19:24.543 --> 19:26.477
Excuse me!

19:26.512 --> 19:27.779
That's my job.

19:27.813 --> 19:29.447
Not today, it isn't.

19:29.481 --> 19:32.850
Well, if you think I'm cleaning
the pool, think again.

19:34.553 --> 19:36.354
Actually...

19:36.388 --> 19:40.525
I had another chore
in mind for you.

19:40.559 --> 19:42.460
I bought you a sketch pad.

19:42.494 --> 19:44.095
Why?

19:44.129 --> 19:46.798
Because you should be doing
what you love.

19:46.832 --> 19:48.366
But Mrs. Powell...

19:48.400 --> 19:51.669
Is going to come home
and find clean rugs.

19:51.703 --> 19:53.371
Enough with the excuses.

19:53.405 --> 19:56.808
Now, go forth...
And design.

20:11.423 --> 20:13.224
So, have you heard
about Carmen?

20:13.258 --> 20:15.560
What about her?

20:15.594 --> 20:17.695
She got a job
as a live-in maid.

20:17.729 --> 20:19.030
I'm so glad.

20:19.064 --> 20:21.566
I know she's been worried
about money.

20:21.600 --> 20:26.671
Yeah, so... I guess you haven't
heard who she's working for.

20:35.714 --> 20:36.714
Rosie!

20:36.748 --> 20:38.049
Hola.
Hey.

20:38.083 --> 20:39.584
Is Mr. Spence here?

20:39.618 --> 20:40.718
No.

20:40.752 --> 20:43.054
Then I need to talk to you.

20:44.923 --> 20:46.757
Sure.
What's going on?

20:46.792 --> 20:49.594
Why didn't you tell me
you got a job with Mr. Spence?

20:49.628 --> 20:52.263
Well, it just happened.
Why?

20:52.297 --> 20:54.599
I told you about us, right?

20:54.633 --> 20:56.734
How he and I...

20:56.768 --> 20:58.836
Had a thing. Yeah. So?

20:58.871 --> 21:01.739
So I don't want you working
for him.

21:01.773 --> 21:03.474
Why not?

21:03.508 --> 21:04.976
It makes me uncomfortable.

21:06.144 --> 21:07.311
I'm so sorry.

21:07.346 --> 21:09.213
I will help you
find another job.

21:09.248 --> 21:11.883
I don't want another job.

21:11.917 --> 21:13.751
What exactly do you think
is gonna happen

21:13.785 --> 21:14.719
if I clean for Spence?

21:14.753 --> 21:16.754
You won't just be cleaning
for him.

21:16.788 --> 21:18.789
You will be living with him...

21:18.824 --> 21:22.059
Alone...
Just the two of you.

21:22.094 --> 21:24.128
Are you serious?

21:24.162 --> 21:28.466
He is very vulnerable,
and you are very pretty.

21:28.500 --> 21:30.935
And you wear things like...
That.

21:30.969 --> 21:32.670
So?

21:32.704 --> 21:34.805
So he will be tempted.

21:34.840 --> 21:37.475
It doesn't matter
if he's tempted. I'm not!

21:37.509 --> 21:40.645
Please.

21:40.679 --> 21:43.681
Just because you screwed
your boss doesn't mean I will.

21:43.715 --> 21:46.484
It was not just sex.

21:46.518 --> 21:48.019
I loved Spence.

21:48.053 --> 21:51.489
And I love a steady paycheck.
Goodbye.

21:51.523 --> 21:53.758
If you are my friend...

21:53.792 --> 21:56.460
Rosie, after the way
you've just insulted me,

21:56.495 --> 21:58.496
I'm gonna have to give that
some thought.

22:11.409 --> 22:14.044
Then Rosie asked me
to stop working for Spence.

22:14.079 --> 22:17.047
Can you believe it?
It's like she doesn't trust me.

22:17.082 --> 22:20.050
Look, when you're in love
with someone,

22:20.085 --> 22:21.652
you're allowed to be
a little irrational.

22:21.686 --> 22:24.154
And if you had talked to Rosie
before you took the job,

22:24.189 --> 22:25.622
you would have known
how she felt.

22:25.657 --> 22:29.126
Well, what's done is done.

22:29.160 --> 22:30.594
This is no longer my problem.

22:30.628 --> 22:32.329
Depends on how you look at it.

22:32.363 --> 22:33.597
Which do you value more,

22:33.631 --> 22:35.766
a job with Spence
or Rosie's friendship?

22:35.800 --> 22:37.267
Well, I don't know.

22:37.302 --> 22:39.536
I mean, how good a friend
is she, really?

22:39.571 --> 22:41.338
Didn't she just loan you money?

22:41.372 --> 22:42.739
I don't like
where this is going.

22:42.774 --> 22:45.075
Even though she's up
to her neck in legal bills,

22:45.110 --> 22:46.443
Rosie still helped you.

22:46.478 --> 22:47.478
Do you know why?

22:47.512 --> 22:49.146
She may have been drunk.

22:49.180 --> 22:50.414
Carmen.

22:50.448 --> 22:53.083
Yeah, okay, yes.

22:53.118 --> 22:54.418
Rosie's a good friend.

22:54.452 --> 22:56.186
But asking me to quit my job...

22:56.221 --> 22:57.855
That's when you know
someone's a great friend.

22:57.889 --> 22:59.857
You ask them
for an impossible favor,

22:59.891 --> 23:01.859
and they still
come through for you.

23:04.062 --> 23:05.362
Okay.

23:05.396 --> 23:07.030
Let's say I stop working
for Spence.

23:07.065 --> 23:08.699
What will I live on?

23:08.733 --> 23:11.101
We'll loan you a little money.

23:11.136 --> 23:13.604
Great friends
would loan me a lot.

23:13.638 --> 23:14.705
We're not great friends.

23:14.739 --> 23:17.341
That's why you should
hang onto Rosie.

23:20.044 --> 23:23.514
I'm so glad you suggested this.

23:23.548 --> 23:26.216
It has been ages
since I've played chess.

23:26.251 --> 23:28.886
I'm coming to regret it.
You're demolishing me.

23:28.920 --> 23:30.621
All in good fun, my friend.

23:32.490 --> 23:34.024
Did you hear that?

23:34.058 --> 23:35.492
Hear what?

23:35.527 --> 23:36.860
It sounded like
a window breaking.

23:36.895 --> 23:38.595
Are you sure?

23:39.998 --> 23:41.498
There it is again.
Someone's breaking in.

23:41.533 --> 23:43.000
Mr. Powell,
I didn't hear anything.

23:43.034 --> 23:45.102
Then you're deaf.
We've got to investigate.

23:50.775 --> 23:52.743
I don't understand it.

23:52.777 --> 23:55.078
I absolutely heard the sound
of breaking glass.

23:55.113 --> 23:57.414
You're just tired.
Why don't you get some rest?

23:57.448 --> 24:00.751
And we'll pick up
our chess game tomorrow, okay?

24:14.265 --> 24:16.567
And this is my date, Helen.

24:16.601 --> 24:18.702
It's so nice to meet you both.

24:18.736 --> 24:20.037
Now, if you'll all excuse me,

24:20.071 --> 24:21.872
I'm in desperate need
of a little-girls' room.

24:24.242 --> 24:26.143
Thanks again
for letting me bring Helen.

24:26.177 --> 24:28.045
I know I put you
in an awkward position.

24:28.079 --> 24:29.146
Eh, it's okay.

24:29.180 --> 24:31.081
We just feel so bad
about the separation.

24:31.115 --> 24:33.083
How is Zoila doing?
Not so good.

24:33.117 --> 24:35.852
When I told her I was seeing
Helen, she was devastated.

24:43.895 --> 24:47.397
She seems to have bounced back.

25:13.658 --> 25:16.260
Why do you have a knife?

25:16.294 --> 25:18.462
- I saw someone come in here!
- When?

25:18.496 --> 25:20.964
- Just now!
- That's ridiculous.

25:20.999 --> 25:22.199
I've been here reading
for the last hour.

25:25.203 --> 25:26.837
Oh.

25:26.871 --> 25:28.071
I-I-I could have sworn...

25:28.106 --> 25:30.240
Adrian...

25:30.275 --> 25:32.342
Please put that thing away.
You're scaring me.

25:35.213 --> 25:38.782
I'm sorry.
I'm... sorry.

25:51.729 --> 25:53.363
So, is he still watching us?

25:53.398 --> 25:55.532
He sure is.

25:55.566 --> 25:57.567
Hold my hand and laugh.

26:03.074 --> 26:07.277
And you are so sweet
for going along with this.

26:07.312 --> 26:09.313
Oh, it's, uh...
It's been fun.

26:09.347 --> 26:10.580
And for the life of me,

26:10.615 --> 26:12.749
I'll never understand
why your husband left you.

26:16.421 --> 26:20.223
I'm about to do something,

26:20.258 --> 26:24.428
and it's not because Pablo
is standing 10 feet away.

26:31.402 --> 26:33.203
Thank you.

26:33.237 --> 26:35.906
Thank you.

26:35.940 --> 26:38.075
You cold?
Yeah.

26:38.109 --> 26:40.744
It's what I get for trying
to show this much cleavage.

26:40.778 --> 26:42.012
Here.

26:42.046 --> 26:43.513
Allow me.

26:43.548 --> 26:45.015
You're such a gentleman.

26:45.049 --> 26:47.651
Well, hard not to be when you're
with such a beautiful lady.

26:47.685 --> 26:50.120
Ooh.

26:50.188 --> 26:51.755
Something's poking me.

26:51.789 --> 26:53.824
Oh, that's my keys.
You can put them on the table.

26:53.858 --> 26:55.826
I'm gonna ask the waiter
to bring us some coffee.

26:55.860 --> 26:57.694
- That should help warm you up.
- Okay.

27:10.775 --> 27:13.243
Waiter will be over in a sec.

27:13.277 --> 27:15.011
What's wrong?

27:15.046 --> 27:18.415
Why did Genevieve
pay you $1,000?

27:18.449 --> 27:20.550
Oh, God.

27:20.585 --> 27:23.353
What's going on?

27:23.388 --> 27:26.790
- I can't tell you.
- Oh, I bet you can.

27:26.824 --> 27:28.959
- Okay. Okay.
- Yeah. Yeah.

27:28.993 --> 27:34.197
Um... Genevieve sort of paid me
to ask you out.

27:34.232 --> 27:36.199
What?

27:36.234 --> 27:37.968
I'm not really a florist.

27:38.002 --> 27:39.469
Then what are you?

27:39.504 --> 27:43.974
Uh, are you familiar with
the website stud-for-hire?

27:44.008 --> 27:46.643
- Oh, my God!
- I'm sorry.

27:46.677 --> 27:50.313
So, you're a hooker?
I kissed a hooker?

27:50.348 --> 27:52.816
I prefer "escort," and if I had
known how nice you are,

27:52.850 --> 27:54.551
I would have taken you out
for free.

27:54.585 --> 27:56.219
Whoa!

27:56.254 --> 27:58.722
If you think I will ever
let you touch me again,

27:58.756 --> 28:00.891
you are sadly mistaken!

28:00.925 --> 28:02.893
Mm!

28:02.927 --> 28:04.261
Mm.

28:04.295 --> 28:06.763
You lying sack of crap.

28:11.102 --> 28:13.703
Take me home.

28:20.336 --> 28:22.304
So, tell me.

28:22.338 --> 28:23.739
How was the party?

28:23.773 --> 28:25.808
Glorious.

28:25.842 --> 28:27.242
Oh!

28:27.277 --> 28:29.978
What did Pablo do
when he saw you with Dave?

28:30.013 --> 28:32.014
Was he furious?

28:32.048 --> 28:35.350
Honestly?
I didn't notice.

28:35.385 --> 28:38.020
Didn't notice?

28:38.054 --> 28:40.022
The whole point
of taking a man to that party

28:40.056 --> 28:41.757
was to get Pablo's attention.

28:41.791 --> 28:44.860
Oh, to hell with Pablo.
I want Dave.

28:44.894 --> 28:46.829
What?

28:46.863 --> 28:49.231
Dave and I had
the most magical connection,

28:49.265 --> 28:51.200
something
I've always dreamed of.

28:51.234 --> 28:53.869
What do you think of
a June wedding?

28:53.903 --> 28:55.838
Oh, my God.

28:55.872 --> 28:58.440
We could have a baby
by the spring.

28:58.475 --> 29:00.642
Zoila, listen to me.

29:00.677 --> 29:02.778
You cannot end up with Dave.

29:02.812 --> 29:04.179
Why not?

29:04.214 --> 29:06.548
Because...

29:06.583 --> 29:08.884
Because he's a male prostitute?

29:08.918 --> 29:10.986
Exactly, and...

29:12.889 --> 29:14.022
Uh-oh.

29:14.057 --> 29:15.357
Come here.

29:15.391 --> 29:16.859
No.

29:16.893 --> 29:19.328
How could you set me up
with a gigolo?

29:19.362 --> 29:21.663
I only paid for companionship.

29:21.698 --> 29:24.566
Frankly, his price for sex
is a little unreasonable.

29:24.601 --> 29:26.468
What were you thinking?!

29:26.503 --> 29:28.137
I thought
you'd make Pablo jealous

29:28.171 --> 29:30.439
and he'd come back to you.

29:30.507 --> 29:32.141
I've been so worried.

29:32.175 --> 29:35.043
Why do you care so much
about my marriage?

29:35.078 --> 29:37.346
Because I don't want you
to end up like me!

29:41.651 --> 29:45.954
It is so horrible...
To be alone at this age.

29:45.989 --> 29:48.724
Oh, honey.

29:48.758 --> 29:51.527
I was trying to protect you.

30:03.907 --> 30:06.341
Things may not work out
with Pablo and me.

30:06.376 --> 30:09.845
It'll be sad, but that's life.

30:09.879 --> 30:12.514
Still, I will not be alone,

30:12.549 --> 30:18.020
because I will have the dearest,
craziest friend

30:18.054 --> 30:21.390
to keep me company
until the day that I die.

30:21.424 --> 30:23.859
That is so sweet.

30:25.461 --> 30:28.263
And if you ever pull
a stunt like this again,

30:28.298 --> 30:30.732
it will be the day
that you die.

30:30.800 --> 30:32.901
Got it?

30:39.209 --> 30:41.577
Hmm.

30:44.480 --> 30:49.851
I was just thinking of someone,
a man I used to know.

30:52.555 --> 30:57.159
You got a dirty mouth
for a man that never talks.

30:58.828 --> 31:00.128
Yes.

31:00.163 --> 31:04.132
We were together,
but this man...

31:04.167 --> 31:07.035
He doesn't
want to see me anymore.

31:10.440 --> 31:14.076
I don't know.

31:14.110 --> 31:18.380
I wish I did...
But I don't.

31:24.187 --> 31:28.323
I guess you can say that.

31:28.358 --> 31:31.159
Let me get you
something to drink.

31:31.194 --> 31:32.828
I'll be right back.

31:53.816 --> 31:57.452
"I know what it's like

31:57.487 --> 32:01.290
"to love someone
and then to lose them...

32:01.324 --> 32:04.793
"But when you are old like me,

32:04.827 --> 32:09.031
"you will learn that...
All things come to an end.

32:09.065 --> 32:13.035
"So you have a choice.

32:13.069 --> 32:17.040
"You can go on being lonely
and missing what you had...

32:19.242 --> 32:25.047
Or you can move on
to something new and wonderful."

32:31.220 --> 32:34.189
You're a wise man,
Mr. Kenneth.

32:43.433 --> 32:45.400
The doctor at sage creek says

32:45.435 --> 32:47.736
I'll need at least a few weeks
of intensive therapy.

32:47.770 --> 32:49.538
Take as much time as you need.

32:49.572 --> 32:52.207
We can't play fast and loose
with your mental health.

32:52.241 --> 32:53.475
Are you sure you don't want

32:53.509 --> 32:55.177
your sister to come for a visit
while I'm gone?

32:55.211 --> 32:56.845
I know you detest
being lonely.

32:56.879 --> 32:59.181
Don't you worry about me.

32:59.215 --> 33:01.516
I will find some way
to occupy myself.

33:01.551 --> 33:03.852
Well...

33:03.886 --> 33:05.921
I guess this is goodbye.

33:05.955 --> 33:08.623
It certainly is.
Goodbye, my darling.

33:14.831 --> 33:18.800
How soon until we go in
and take off our clothes?

33:18.835 --> 33:21.470
Out of respect...

33:21.504 --> 33:24.639
We should wait until his car
leaves the driveway.

33:31.481 --> 33:35.117
Hey, sweetheart.
How was your day?

33:35.151 --> 33:36.318
Enlightening.

33:36.352 --> 33:37.953
Oh?

33:37.987 --> 33:40.489
I just got off the phone
with my attorney.

33:40.523 --> 33:44.159
He said you left Ethan
$5 million in your will.

33:48.831 --> 33:52.267
Why does it feel like you're
accusing me of something?

33:52.301 --> 33:56.605
I'm just trying to understand

33:56.639 --> 34:01.076
why you'd leave that much money
to your maid's son.

34:01.110 --> 34:04.713
It doesn't make sense unless...

34:04.747 --> 34:06.181
Unless what?

34:06.215 --> 34:10.585
Unless...
He's also your son.

34:10.620 --> 34:12.754
You think I had an affair
with Opal?

34:12.789 --> 34:15.090
I don't know.

34:15.123 --> 34:16.925
Well, then you
should have asked...

34:16.958 --> 34:18.592
Instead of using a prenup
as an excuse

34:18.628 --> 34:20.195
to look through
my financial records.

34:20.228 --> 34:22.364
Fine.
I'm a terrible person.

34:22.398 --> 34:24.199
- Why is Ethan in your will?
- You know, if you think

34:24.233 --> 34:26.333
I would cheat on my wife,
why are you even here?

34:26.369 --> 34:28.503
I want to trust you. If there's
something I'm missing...

34:28.538 --> 34:31.672
Yes, I care about Ethan!
He grew up in this house!

34:31.706 --> 34:33.775
Is... is it so strange
that I'd provide for him?!

34:33.810 --> 34:35.143
God, I am so angry
with you right now!

34:35.145 --> 34:36.478
I'm sorry. I am.

34:38.380 --> 34:41.817
But I need you
to say the words.

34:47.056 --> 34:50.358
Ethan is not my son.

34:52.094 --> 34:54.696
And I'm sleeping
in the guest room tonight.

35:03.866 --> 35:06.501
It's open.

35:06.535 --> 35:08.569
Come on in.

35:09.716 --> 35:11.205
Hey.

35:16.745 --> 35:17.979
What are you doing here?

35:18.013 --> 35:22.316
I've been thinking.
I hate being a maid.

35:22.351 --> 35:24.986
And to risk a friendship
over a job I despise,

35:25.020 --> 35:28.423
that's... well, that's dumb.
Even for me.

35:28.457 --> 35:30.091
Carmen.

35:30.125 --> 35:31.759
So I'm gonna tell Spence
that he's got to find

35:31.794 --> 35:34.862
someone else to scrub
his floors, okay?

35:40.302 --> 35:42.270
I've been thinking, too,

35:42.304 --> 35:44.939
and I can't keep
worrying about Spence.

35:44.973 --> 35:48.876
He is living his life... and
it's time for me to live mine.

35:48.911 --> 35:51.112
So you don't want me to quit?

35:53.982 --> 35:56.417
It would be nice to know
that someone I trust

35:56.452 --> 35:58.286
will be there
to look after him.

35:59.321 --> 36:01.422
I'll take wonderful care
of him.

36:01.457 --> 36:03.758
Thank you.

36:03.792 --> 36:05.259
Hey, Rosie.

36:05.294 --> 36:07.161
Ready to go?

36:07.196 --> 36:10.364
Yes.
I'll be right there.

36:12.301 --> 36:14.702
You got a date?

36:14.736 --> 36:17.538
I told you.
I'm living my life.

36:17.573 --> 36:19.507
Do I look okay?

36:19.541 --> 36:21.242
Hold on.

36:22.911 --> 36:25.246
This.

36:25.280 --> 36:26.914
Much better.

36:26.949 --> 36:29.484
Well, I got to go make dinner
for Spence.

36:29.518 --> 36:31.652
Oh. Hold on.

36:36.925 --> 36:38.593
Much better.

36:45.968 --> 36:48.936
Wow. You sketched your
little heart out, didn't you?

36:49.972 --> 36:52.073
What can I say?

36:52.107 --> 36:53.274
You inspired me.

36:53.308 --> 36:55.476
Do you like them?

36:55.511 --> 36:58.479
You know,
I-I'm sure they're great,

36:58.514 --> 37:01.449
but I really don't know anything
about clothes.

37:01.483 --> 37:02.884
They're just statements.

37:02.918 --> 37:05.686
What you wear says something
about who you are

37:05.721 --> 37:07.822
or who you'd like to be.

37:07.856 --> 37:11.492
I think now is the perfect
time for my gift. Gift?

37:11.527 --> 37:17.164
Like I said,
you inspired me, so...

37:17.199 --> 37:20.501
I made you something.

37:20.536 --> 37:21.602
Whoa.

37:21.637 --> 37:24.438
Do you like it?

37:24.473 --> 37:26.507
Yeah.

37:26.542 --> 37:27.875
Really?

37:27.910 --> 37:30.945
Yeah. This is, like, the nicest
shirt I've ever owned.

37:30.979 --> 37:33.114
You don't have to say that.

37:33.148 --> 37:36.284
Then how about I say this?

37:49.464 --> 37:50.765
Hello?

37:50.799 --> 37:52.266
Mrs. Delatour,

37:52.301 --> 37:55.269
I'm Dr. Gold
from Remi's program in Africa.

37:55.304 --> 37:57.772
Is everything okay?
Well, not really.

37:57.806 --> 38:00.041
Remi has a rather serious
viral infection,

38:00.075 --> 38:02.310
and he's not responding
to our treatments.

38:02.344 --> 38:04.145
Oh, my God.

38:04.179 --> 38:06.814
Do you need me
to fly out there?

38:06.848 --> 38:11.485
No. We're sending him home
on the next plane.

38:11.520 --> 38:13.287
Thank you.

38:21.396 --> 38:25.333
I heard raised voices
last night.

38:25.400 --> 38:26.867
Is everything all right?

38:26.902 --> 38:31.238
Nicholas and I just had
a bit of a... disagreement.

38:31.273 --> 38:33.107
That's all.

38:36.445 --> 38:38.679
I heard my name mentioned.

38:38.714 --> 38:41.782
I talked to Ethan
a few days ago.

38:41.850 --> 38:45.486
He told me he didn't know
who his father was.

38:45.520 --> 38:49.490
Then I discovered that Nicholas

38:49.524 --> 38:52.493
has left Ethan a lot of money
in his will, so...

38:52.527 --> 38:56.497
You let your imagination
run wild.

38:56.531 --> 38:58.165
I'm afraid so.

38:58.200 --> 39:00.334
Hmm.

39:00.369 --> 39:02.870
My first husband cheated on me.

39:02.904 --> 39:05.673
Clearly, I have trust issues.

39:07.795 --> 39:11.779
I met Ethan's father...
In a bar.

39:11.813 --> 39:15.516
He told me I was pretty.

39:15.550 --> 39:18.185
In those days, that was
something I needed to hear,

39:18.220 --> 39:22.289
so...
I let him take me home.

39:22.324 --> 39:27.628
But there was something
about him, something...

39:27.663 --> 39:29.797
Frightening.

39:29.831 --> 39:34.669
Halfway through,
I changed my mind.

39:36.271 --> 39:38.572
I wanted to leave.

39:38.607 --> 39:42.309
But he wouldn't let me.

39:42.344 --> 39:47.014
Ethan was the result
of that horrifying night.

39:47.082 --> 39:48.783
Opal...

39:48.817 --> 39:50.951
I never told my son.

39:50.986 --> 39:55.790
I'd... rather he think
I was promiscuous

39:55.824 --> 39:59.827
than tell him that
his father was a monster.

39:59.861 --> 40:02.063
I am so sorry.

40:02.097 --> 40:04.565
Don't be.

40:04.599 --> 40:08.302
My life worked out in the end.

40:08.336 --> 40:12.306
I have a decent job,
a nice place to live.

40:12.340 --> 40:16.811
And someday,
though he doesn't know it yet,

40:16.845 --> 40:20.614
my son will become
a very rich man.

40:22.525 --> 40:26.454
I owe that all to Nicholas.

40:26.488 --> 40:30.458
He has been so kind.

40:32.994 --> 40:35.629
And I will always be
in his debt.

40:52.914 --> 40:55.349
Well...

40:55.417 --> 40:57.017
Did you talk to her?

40:57.052 --> 40:59.787
I told Marisol you left Ethan
all that money

40:59.821 --> 41:02.056
out of the goodness
of your heart.

41:02.090 --> 41:04.391
Thank you for lying.

41:04.426 --> 41:06.594
A deal's a deal.
