01:30.399 --> 01:31.859
Dear Ryan,

01:32.317 --> 01:35.779
I reckon you're feeling lonely
now that your mother is gone.

01:35.946 --> 01:38.282
You're too young
for something like this.

01:39.700 --> 01:43.871
She must've told you about me, and
I never stopped thinking about you.

01:44.371 --> 01:47.082
Even though I've never seen you,
I bet my best memories

01:47.249 --> 01:50.210
I'd recognize you
in the blackest night.

01:51.462 --> 01:54.298
These past years
have been hard on us all.

01:54.465 --> 01:56.717
Very few of us are still around.

01:58.052 --> 02:01.764
The land where I live now
is a good one, quiet people,

02:02.056 --> 02:04.141
peaceful for the most part.

02:04.933 --> 02:06.727
But it's not home.

02:07.519 --> 02:10.064
That's why it's time for me
to come back...

02:11.648 --> 02:14.777
You'll burn this letter after you read
it, like your mother would've done,

02:14.943 --> 02:16.445
and wait for me.

02:17.654 --> 02:19.073
Much love,

02:19.948 --> 02:21.742
your uncle.

03:12.251 --> 03:14.545
I can't come tomorrow.

03:20.092 --> 03:23.637
We need you to pay us
for this week's work.

03:24.680 --> 03:27.891
And for the seeds too.
You never paid for them.

03:28.892 --> 03:31.854
You know where the money is.
Just take it.

03:32.104 --> 03:32.896
No.

03:33.188 --> 03:34.982
You're the boss.

03:35.149 --> 03:37.234
You have to give it to me.

03:37.401 --> 03:40.487
I can't take it.
That would be wrong.

03:41.530 --> 03:43.365
I'm not your wife.

03:45.868 --> 03:46.952
Sure.

03:50.539 --> 03:52.624
You're right, Yana.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.295
You're right.

04:03.093 --> 04:04.511
I have rain gear.

04:08.015 --> 04:10.392
Mr. James, you're going away,
aren't you?

04:11.185 --> 04:15.230
My mom says all gringos leave
once they have lots of money.

04:15.856 --> 04:19.151
You're a gringo,
but you don't have that much money.

04:20.652 --> 04:24.239
I'll have enough
after selling the horses.

04:26.533 --> 04:28.243
Take care, Yana.

04:28.410 --> 04:31.121
I'll see you
when I'm back from Potosi.

04:31.330 --> 04:33.707
Then I'll leave for good.

05:04.822 --> 05:06.198
There ain't no grave

05:06.907 --> 05:09.243
can hold my body down.

05:10.703 --> 05:14.873
There ain't no grave
can hold my body down.

05:17.459 --> 05:20.004
When I hear that trumpet sound

05:20.254 --> 05:22.715
I'm gonna rise
right out of the ground.

05:22.881 --> 05:24.008
Ain't no grave

05:24.883 --> 05:27.219
can hold my body down.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.974
Well, I look way down the river

05:32.725 --> 05:34.810
And what do you think I see?

05:35.644 --> 05:38.022
I see a band of angels

05:38.564 --> 05:40.774
And they're coming after me.

05:40.941 --> 05:41.859
There ain't no grave

05:43.110 --> 05:45.446
can hold my body down.

05:47.156 --> 05:51.160
There ain't no grave
can hold my body down.

05:53.662 --> 05:55.998
Well, look down yonder, Gabriel,

05:56.623 --> 05:59.585
Put your feet on the land
and see.

06:00.252 --> 06:03.130
But Gabriel,
don't you blow your horn

06:03.297 --> 06:04.882
Until you hear from me.

06:05.049 --> 06:06.967
There ain't no grave

06:07.217 --> 06:09.595
can hold my body down.

06:11.263 --> 06:15.267
There ain't no grave
can hold my body down.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.322
Take care of him.

07:17.121 --> 07:18.872
I'm withdrawing all mymoney.

07:19.623 --> 07:21.875
In dollars, please.

07:36.223 --> 07:37.641
Mr. Blackthorn,

07:37.808 --> 07:39.852
have we done anything to upset you?

07:40.019 --> 07:42.271
You know, there is just one thing.

07:42.813 --> 07:46.984
I can't remember ever being
so well received in a bank before.

07:47.401 --> 07:48.736
Good day.

08:22.478 --> 08:24.897
Your whisky, sir. American.

08:25.064 --> 08:26.190
Here. Thanks.

08:27.983 --> 08:30.069
Americans are creatures of habit.

08:30.235 --> 08:33.322
They have excellent Scotch here,
French cognac...

08:33.489 --> 08:37.159
But Mr. Blackthorn here likes
to stick with his old gringo whisky.

08:37.326 --> 08:39.870
Yeah, it just seems to haunt me,
you know.

08:41.163 --> 08:42.331
To a fine sale.

08:42.498 --> 08:43.164
Thank you.

08:43.749 --> 08:46.710
You have quite a talent
for breeding horses.

08:46.877 --> 08:49.380
Those horses will be the envy
of many men around here.

08:49.546 --> 08:52.132
But you'd think that here,
in Bolivia,

08:52.299 --> 08:56.470
with so many bloody Indians, it
would be simple to find good horses.

08:57.096 --> 08:59.556
Indians got nothing to do with it.

09:00.099 --> 09:03.602
The terrain's too rugged here
for good horses. Too high.

09:07.147 --> 09:11.110
I was wondering if maybe you all would
like to play a few rounds of cards.

09:12.111 --> 09:13.278
What you think?

09:13.445 --> 09:15.614
Yes, we're in.

09:15.781 --> 09:18.951
I miss a good card game
out on the ranch.

09:19.618 --> 09:22.788
Ain't nothing but a goddamned bunch
of Indians out there, you know.

09:22.955 --> 09:26.667
There's no civilized folk,
like yourselves.

11:07.768 --> 11:08.852
Easy.

11:10.396 --> 11:12.690
Don't leave me now, Cinco.

11:16.443 --> 11:17.695
Easy, buddy.

11:21.991 --> 11:23.075
Easy, buddy.

11:23.242 --> 11:24.284
Don't move!

11:27.246 --> 11:28.706
Come here, horse.

11:29.123 --> 11:30.207
That's it.

11:53.647 --> 11:55.441
Goddamnit!

12:02.239 --> 12:04.742
- I'm out of bullets.
- Get up.

12:48.327 --> 12:49.328
Please.

12:51.246 --> 12:53.040
I'm freezing.

12:53.499 --> 12:54.458
Are you Chilean?

12:57.086 --> 12:58.295
Spanish.

12:58.921 --> 13:00.673
Conquistador!

13:01.382 --> 13:02.883
I just came here to work.

13:08.180 --> 13:09.682
Are you going to kill me?

13:09.848 --> 13:11.183
So you speak English.

13:14.436 --> 13:16.647
You got any idea
where in the world we are?

13:17.606 --> 13:19.566
We're in the middle of nowhere.

13:20.275 --> 13:22.903
My entire future
ran off with that horse.

13:23.445 --> 13:26.365
Everything I've got.
6.000 dollars to get me back home.

13:26.615 --> 13:28.450
Horse alone's worth 500.

13:28.617 --> 13:31.787
Now I've got your miserable life
on my hands...

13:31.954 --> 13:33.372
Ain't worth a nickel.

13:33.539 --> 13:35.165
I'm sorry.

13:36.542 --> 13:38.002
I thought you were after me.

13:38.460 --> 13:41.630
Please, I just want
to live a little longer.

13:41.797 --> 13:42.715
You do, huh?

13:54.435 --> 13:55.978
Be my guest.

14:10.034 --> 14:11.285
Eat.

14:11.493 --> 14:14.038
Eat, you flea-ridden coward.

14:14.913 --> 14:16.999
It was just a little jump.

14:17.875 --> 14:19.335
"The best horses..."

14:20.210 --> 14:21.462
Filthy hag!

14:23.380 --> 14:24.965
I'll run you all the way

14:25.132 --> 14:26.592
from here to El Paso!

14:35.267 --> 14:36.727
Oh, shit.

14:39.063 --> 14:39.855
Come on.

14:46.737 --> 14:47.404
Fuck!

14:53.410 --> 14:55.621
What the hell are you doing, Butch?

14:56.914 --> 15:00.167
- Not the best place to rest.
- It has a nice view.

15:15.224 --> 15:16.767
She's handy.

15:17.226 --> 15:18.352
You teach her?

15:18.852 --> 15:21.939
I don't think
anybody ever taught her anything.

15:22.106 --> 15:24.733
And it's about time
you learned her name.

15:28.946 --> 15:32.157
Kid, I think it's time for us to go.

15:32.324 --> 15:34.410
Don't worry, those were the last.

15:34.576 --> 15:36.120
You're not listening.

15:36.745 --> 15:39.206
I mean go as in leave.

15:39.581 --> 15:42.084
Go to South America. Now.

15:48.298 --> 15:50.217
Butch wants to leave.

15:50.467 --> 15:52.261
Go to South America.

15:53.262 --> 15:54.555
And he wants me to go with him.

15:56.098 --> 15:57.558
Why you tellin' me?

15:57.725 --> 16:00.144
I think it might be a good idea.

16:01.395 --> 16:02.688
The three of us.

16:03.564 --> 16:04.857
That's all.

16:09.570 --> 16:11.572
It's a great idea.

16:53.906 --> 16:56.325
You're pushing your luck, son.

16:58.619 --> 16:59.828
Please.

17:01.246 --> 17:03.707
They've been following me for days.

17:05.041 --> 17:06.377
I need your help.

17:44.623 --> 17:47.251
Alright, now you can be on your way.

17:48.585 --> 17:52.631
Taypi is only about 15 miles away down
the tracks here, so you just follow it.

17:52.798 --> 17:55.759
Even if I make it,
they'll catch me.

17:55.926 --> 17:57.386
And they'll kill me.

17:58.012 --> 18:00.139
Well, good for them,
whoever they are.

18:00.639 --> 18:03.308
I'm not gonna repeat myself,
you son of a bitch!

18:03.475 --> 18:05.102
Get up and get down the tracks!

18:06.562 --> 18:10.482
Please. Have pity and help me.

18:13.485 --> 18:14.945
I can give you your money back.

18:16.947 --> 18:20.200
I have the money, but it's hidden.

18:20.367 --> 18:22.369
That's why they're after me.

18:25.706 --> 18:28.709
You'd better not be playing me,
you bastard!

18:33.380 --> 18:36.300
It's two or three days
on horseback from here.

18:36.717 --> 18:38.344
An abandoned mine.

18:38.761 --> 18:40.512
I'm an engineer.

18:40.763 --> 18:44.099
I worked at the tin mines.
That's why I came over from Spain.

18:44.933 --> 18:47.936
When we get there, I'll give you
your money back. I promise.

18:49.563 --> 18:51.106
That's not good enough.

18:54.443 --> 18:56.403
I stole from the mine
I was working in,

18:56.737 --> 18:57.780
in Oruro.

18:57.946 --> 19:00.741
Those mines are well-guarded.
PatiÃ±o owns all that.

19:02.785 --> 19:03.869
Yeah.

19:05.204 --> 19:07.748
You stole from SimÃ³n PatiÃ±o?

19:09.458 --> 19:11.752
You're planting high cotton, boy.

19:13.504 --> 19:14.505
Can I have a drink?

19:20.928 --> 19:22.554
PatiÃ±o, huh?

19:26.183 --> 19:27.267
Yes.

19:27.601 --> 19:29.269
I robbed the Suyana Mine.

19:29.436 --> 19:30.646
PatiÃ±o... You know him?

19:30.813 --> 19:34.983
I know snakes, no matter
what hole they crawl out of.

19:41.573 --> 19:43.701
- How many's following you?
- I don't know.

19:44.326 --> 19:46.453
A dozen maybe, I'm not sure.

19:46.620 --> 19:48.163
How far back are they?

19:48.330 --> 19:50.082
A day or two.

19:52.167 --> 19:53.711
Not anymore.

20:25.075 --> 20:26.618
Who are you?

20:27.745 --> 20:29.621
My name is Eduardo.

20:30.331 --> 20:33.417
How much money did you steal, Eduardo?

20:33.709 --> 20:35.294
Not much. Just enough to...

20:35.461 --> 20:38.589
Nobody steals "not much" from
the richest man on the continent.

20:38.756 --> 20:40.632
How much did you steal?

20:41.383 --> 20:43.677
10,000 pounds sterling.

20:44.303 --> 20:47.056
50,000 American dollars,
more or less.

20:47.222 --> 20:49.475
Well, that's 25,000 for me, then.

20:49.641 --> 20:51.352
But you said 6,000.

20:51.727 --> 20:52.811
Look,

20:52.978 --> 20:57.024
the only reason that you're alive
is that you might have some money.

20:57.316 --> 20:58.609
Now you owe me half!

20:58.776 --> 21:02.279
You owe me for every step I take without
a horse, every hour I go without water

21:02.655 --> 21:06.825
and you also owe me for not shooting
your sorry ass the first time I saw you!

21:07.076 --> 21:08.952
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

21:09.119 --> 21:11.455
Now shut the fuck up
and just follow me.

21:29.390 --> 21:30.849
Fuck!

21:31.266 --> 21:33.686
Four days without a hat.

21:34.311 --> 21:37.022
This plateau sun is killing me.

21:38.607 --> 21:40.818
Meet me at the cantina.

21:46.156 --> 21:47.616
Keeper.

21:48.617 --> 21:50.077
We only have chicha.

21:50.244 --> 21:52.663
No. I want a pitcher of water.

21:52.830 --> 21:54.331
There's only chicha.

21:54.790 --> 21:56.041
Yeah...

22:01.755 --> 22:03.465
Two Bolivianos.

22:27.239 --> 22:28.949
Give me a drink.

22:29.116 --> 22:32.328
And I want
two boxes of ammunition too.

22:32.494 --> 22:33.412
The same as yours.

22:33.579 --> 22:35.080
- I only have one.
- Okay.

22:36.290 --> 22:37.249
Thanks.

22:41.086 --> 22:43.672
I bought us a couple of mules.
That's all there is around here.

22:43.839 --> 22:45.299
At least buy me a drink.

22:45.799 --> 22:47.468
You'll soon be rich.

22:49.219 --> 22:50.262
Nice pistol.

22:59.188 --> 23:00.647
I should thank you.

23:00.814 --> 23:02.274
I could have died.

23:02.733 --> 23:04.610
The plateau is like hell.

23:04.777 --> 23:06.028
You got no business
judging this land.

23:06.362 --> 23:08.822
And I'm not helping you either.

23:09.239 --> 23:11.575
I'm just trying to get back
what's mine.

23:12.534 --> 23:13.535
Okay.

23:15.871 --> 23:18.582
- So, what do we do now?
- Drink.

23:18.874 --> 23:22.002
- Okay. We agree on something.
- In silence.

23:30.010 --> 23:32.221
Will you get your ass up!

23:32.388 --> 23:35.265
I've got a couple mules here.
Let's get mounted.

23:39.311 --> 23:40.521
Come on!

23:42.314 --> 23:44.024
I'm ready when you are.

23:50.155 --> 23:51.240
Thank you.

23:51.407 --> 23:54.076
If that money doesn't exist,
I'm going to kill you.

23:54.243 --> 23:56.954
And take my sweet time
doing it too.

24:09.550 --> 24:11.635
Shouldn't we move faster?

24:12.970 --> 24:17.099
Last time you moved faster you killed
your horse, don't you remember?

24:17.808 --> 24:19.643
I wouldn't say
I killed my horse.

24:19.810 --> 24:22.312
You wouldn't, huh?
What would you say?

24:22.855 --> 24:25.065
Hey, who do you think you are?

24:25.733 --> 24:28.569
We could get shot any minute now
and you're acting like...

24:29.111 --> 24:30.779
What? Come on.

24:31.155 --> 24:34.241
Enough already!
Go to hell, man!

24:34.825 --> 24:37.328
Go to fucking hell!

25:18.452 --> 25:20.704
The last miner left 8 years ago.

25:20.871 --> 25:24.083
There were 10,000 people
living here at one point.

25:24.500 --> 25:28.003
PatiÃ±o was convinced he could
bleed a little more out of it.

25:28.337 --> 25:30.130
So, when I came over from Spain,

25:30.297 --> 25:34.468
he sent me here and had me
searching six months. For nothing.

25:35.969 --> 25:39.056
I know this mine
like I dug it myself.

25:39.348 --> 25:40.683
You'd better.

25:50.734 --> 25:53.654
Are you going to kill me
when you get the money?

25:54.571 --> 25:56.824
Come on, let's get this over with.

25:58.784 --> 25:59.868
Wait.

26:03.998 --> 26:06.792
I have no reason to trust you either.

26:07.292 --> 26:09.962
There's a lot of money at stake.

26:10.421 --> 26:12.131
Where did you get that antique?

26:12.297 --> 26:14.216
I'm not so bad with Bolivian women.

26:16.468 --> 26:18.554
So, are you going to shoot me now?

26:21.140 --> 26:23.392
No, I don't want to.

26:24.518 --> 26:28.063
We've been together for days
and I don't even know your name.

26:28.856 --> 26:30.774
I can't trust
someone with no name.

26:30.941 --> 26:32.860
Well, you ought to trust me.

26:34.320 --> 26:37.364
I saved your life
a couple of times, didn't I?

26:38.073 --> 26:40.409
Besides, I'm not your problem.

26:40.784 --> 26:42.202
That's your problem over there.

26:42.911 --> 26:43.746
What?

26:44.121 --> 26:45.456
That dust.

26:50.294 --> 26:53.422
Those could be several
of your friends at full gallop.

26:56.884 --> 26:58.260
You're empty, son.

27:00.346 --> 27:01.513
You're a son of a bitch.

27:03.307 --> 27:04.475
Yeah.

27:05.601 --> 27:09.271
You should hear
what they called me back in Wyoming.

27:28.540 --> 27:30.000
We're close.

27:30.417 --> 27:33.420
Next gallery to the left.
Watch your head.

27:35.214 --> 27:37.925
When did you find out
I had the other revolver?

27:38.092 --> 27:40.094
About ten minutes ago.

27:49.144 --> 27:50.979
Giddy up, son! Bring the light!

27:51.146 --> 27:53.482
I'm not a goddamn mole!

28:06.495 --> 28:08.122
It's all here.

28:09.123 --> 28:10.457
I'm willing to split it now.

28:10.624 --> 28:12.793
- What's to split?
- Sorry?

28:12.960 --> 28:15.254
There's nothing to split.
It's useless in here.

28:15.421 --> 28:17.631
I mean, if you make it out of here
alive, it might be worth something.

28:17.798 --> 28:21.176
But right now all you got
is your stupid gun and your lamp.

28:22.302 --> 28:23.804
How the hell do we get out of here?

28:24.596 --> 28:26.724
- Just follow me.
- Yeah, that's what I've been doing.

28:26.890 --> 28:27.725
Come on!

28:27.891 --> 28:30.644
The mine has lots of ways
out to the mountain.

28:41.655 --> 28:44.199
Now what, Mr. Engineer?

28:46.035 --> 28:48.829
Shoot the lights!
Leave them blind!

28:49.663 --> 28:51.957
Okay, here's your gun back.

28:55.294 --> 28:56.712
- Ready?
- Ready.

29:13.312 --> 29:15.314
Goddamned Spaniard!

29:15.606 --> 29:16.940
You call this a way out?

29:17.107 --> 29:19.985
I could find my way out of Hell
easier than this.

29:20.736 --> 29:22.279
Thanks to this way out,

29:22.446 --> 29:26.325
it'll be impossible for them
to pick up our trail again, old man.

29:29.370 --> 29:31.288
Where the hell are we?

29:44.927 --> 29:46.720
- We're safe.
- Safe?

29:46.887 --> 29:49.973
You stole 50,000 dollars.
You ain't gonna be safe for long.

29:50.140 --> 29:52.059
Well, I guess
I'll have to live with that.

29:52.601 --> 29:54.019
But I feel good.

29:54.186 --> 29:55.979
I feel better than ever.

30:06.657 --> 30:08.909
My name's James Blackthorn.

30:09.076 --> 30:10.953
Utah, United States.

30:11.120 --> 30:14.415
Eduardo Apodaca.
From Madrid, Spain.

30:16.834 --> 30:20.671
Rosario is not too far from here.
We can buy some cheap horses over there.

30:20.921 --> 30:23.340
I got me a little ranch
somewhere around here.

30:23.507 --> 30:25.426
We can get some rest up there.

30:28.721 --> 30:31.015
Sometimes it's beautiful...

30:31.640 --> 30:33.392
It is that.

30:44.111 --> 30:47.489
You kept me waiting for an hour
for that?

30:47.656 --> 30:48.574
You in a hurry?

30:49.116 --> 30:51.952
Sometimes, this is like having
a little friend along with you.

30:53.579 --> 30:55.831
- Maybe even better.
- Yeah.

30:57.207 --> 31:01.378
Well, my name it is Sam Hall,
Sam Hall

31:03.672 --> 31:07.384
My name it is Sam Hall,
Sam Hall

31:08.469 --> 31:11.096
My name it is Sam Hall

31:11.305 --> 31:13.766
and I hate you, one and all

31:13.932 --> 31:16.101
And I hate you, one and all

31:16.268 --> 31:18.520
Damn your eyes!

31:19.355 --> 31:23.359
To the gallows I must go,
I must go

31:24.485 --> 31:28.656
To the gallows I must go,
I must go

31:30.366 --> 31:32.618
To the gallows I must go,

31:32.785 --> 31:35.412
while you critters down below

31:35.579 --> 31:38.165
Yell out: "Sam, I told you so"

31:38.332 --> 31:40.793
Well, damn your eyes!

31:41.585 --> 31:45.714
Now the preacher he did come,
he did come

31:46.840 --> 31:49.843
Yes, the preacher he did come,
he did come

31:51.845 --> 31:54.139
The preacher he did come

31:54.306 --> 31:56.433
and he preached till Kingdom come

31:56.600 --> 32:00.771
Well, you can kiss my bloody bum
Damn his eyes!

32:02.231 --> 32:05.859
My name is Samu-el,
Samu-el

32:07.611 --> 32:10.864
My name is Samu-el,
Samu-el

32:12.950 --> 32:15.285
My name is Samu-el,

32:15.452 --> 32:18.372
I'll see you all in Hell

32:18.539 --> 32:20.916
An' I'll see you all in Hell

32:21.083 --> 32:23.002
Damn your eyes...

32:35.264 --> 32:38.350
You're rich, right?
I mean, your family.

32:39.184 --> 32:42.312
Well, I guess it depends
on whom you compare me to.

32:42.855 --> 32:44.565
Poor people.

32:46.358 --> 32:50.070
In that case, I reckon
you could say I grew up comfortably.

32:51.155 --> 32:54.158
Never rode with a gentleman before.

32:55.701 --> 32:57.786
Never thought I would.

33:00.456 --> 33:03.334
Friendship is the most valuable
thing a man can have.

33:04.668 --> 33:08.547
It's worth more than money,
land, horses or cattle.

33:10.090 --> 33:14.011
It might be the only thing you
never forget. And it lasts forever.

33:15.220 --> 33:18.474
Your father believed that.
Your mother did too.

33:35.491 --> 33:37.868
You just have to hold
the cards steady.

33:39.953 --> 33:43.957
Rattlesnake bites are your thing,
not mosquitoes.

33:46.627 --> 33:49.630
Etta bought these suits
so we could wear them, Butch.

33:49.797 --> 33:52.675
Now get up off your sorry ass
and come downstairs with us.

33:52.841 --> 33:56.387
Argentinians know plenty,
but not about poker.

33:56.720 --> 33:59.014
Not about poker, my friend.

33:59.890 --> 34:01.475
You two are...

34:03.310 --> 34:04.478
you're quite a sight.

34:05.688 --> 34:08.315
All the more reason
for you to join us.

34:08.899 --> 34:10.359
Go on, get out of here, damn it.

34:10.525 --> 34:11.985
I need some sleep.

34:12.444 --> 34:14.112
Bring me up someting to drink.

34:14.279 --> 34:15.739
And watch yourselves.

34:15.906 --> 34:17.032
Come on, Butch...

34:17.199 --> 34:20.244
Ain't nobody
been chasing us for a long time.

34:22.955 --> 34:27.126
"Ain't nobody
been chasing us for a long time."

34:27.292 --> 34:29.545
- Damn your eyes.
- Shut up.

34:29.712 --> 34:33.716
We'd have been long gone three days ago
if it hadn't been for your mosquito bite.

34:34.800 --> 34:37.136
I can't even pronounce
the name of this damn place.

34:37.302 --> 34:39.304
San Juan.

34:40.179 --> 34:41.639
Anyways...

34:42.266 --> 34:44.685
And why the hell
haven't they put cuffs on us?

34:44.851 --> 34:48.022
They probably
don't have any handcuffs.

34:49.481 --> 34:51.275
This is humiliating.

34:51.442 --> 34:53.277
You don't say.

34:59.700 --> 35:01.493
Right, here we go.

35:02.995 --> 35:04.163
Sir,

35:04.997 --> 35:07.916
there's your gringo bandits.
One's sick.

35:12.254 --> 35:15.007
Sorry to hear
you've not been too well.

35:15.174 --> 35:18.260
It's just an insect bite,
Mr. MacKinley. Nothing serious.

35:18.427 --> 35:19.803
Yes, these places...

35:20.387 --> 35:24.516
You never know
what'll be the next damn insect

35:24.683 --> 35:26.977
or vermin
to rip a piece off of you.

35:28.937 --> 35:30.147
Look.

35:30.939 --> 35:33.901
Snake bite,
two years ago at Chaco.

35:34.068 --> 35:36.487
There's a saying around here:
"Dos pasitos".

35:36.779 --> 35:38.322
"Two steps".

35:38.489 --> 35:40.783
They say that by the third step
you're dead.

35:43.535 --> 35:44.995
I got lucky.

35:46.997 --> 35:48.332
This one

35:49.708 --> 35:53.003
was last winter in Atacama.

35:53.170 --> 35:56.965
A scorpion the size of a clock.
I could hardly walk for two months.

35:57.383 --> 35:59.093
Then I was left with this lump.

36:01.345 --> 36:05.307
But I'm sure I'm not telling you
a damn thing you don't know yourselves.

36:05.808 --> 36:08.102
We've all been in the same places.

36:08.602 --> 36:11.021
It was about time
we met face to face.

36:12.773 --> 36:14.942
- Finally.
- Go to hell, MacKinley.

36:15.567 --> 36:17.152
Let's get it over with.

36:17.319 --> 36:19.113
I can't wait.

36:19.697 --> 36:22.574
Open. It's the sheriff.

36:27.788 --> 36:29.039
Mr. Albion MacKinley,

36:29.832 --> 36:32.418
may I introduce Miss Etta Place.

36:35.963 --> 36:37.965
Well, well, MacKinley.

36:39.049 --> 36:40.801
You're a gentleman.

36:41.343 --> 36:43.679
I thought all Pinkerton men

36:43.846 --> 36:45.764
were bloodthirsty thugs

36:46.223 --> 36:48.267
sold to the highest bidder.

36:49.059 --> 36:51.145
- You gonna run in your underwear?
- What?

37:09.830 --> 37:13.250
I have a gift for you.

37:19.506 --> 37:22.092
It's a gringo machine.

37:22.259 --> 37:24.178
Silver is best used
for other things.

37:24.345 --> 37:25.888
I don't understand that time.

37:26.555 --> 37:27.848
Yeah, me neither.

37:29.141 --> 37:30.934
Don't do that! It's mine!

37:36.065 --> 37:37.441
Keep it.

37:38.067 --> 37:40.277
It's something
to remember me by.

37:41.403 --> 37:42.154
Cheers.

37:43.155 --> 37:44.156
Cheers.

37:45.032 --> 37:46.617
To the two of you.

37:50.245 --> 37:52.706
I'm going to go. It's dark out.

37:55.084 --> 37:56.460
Yana,

37:57.753 --> 38:01.465
you know I'm going back
to my country tomorrow.

38:01.757 --> 38:03.258
For good.

38:03.425 --> 38:05.886
Spend the night here, please.

38:07.805 --> 38:08.764
I can't.

38:09.515 --> 38:13.060
My family's waiting for me.
It's dark out.

38:15.104 --> 38:16.188
Sure.

38:23.904 --> 38:26.115
I have rain gear.

38:28.867 --> 38:30.661
- No?
- No.

38:41.672 --> 38:44.800
Goodbye, Mr. James.
Take care of yourself.

39:10.034 --> 39:11.827
What about all this?

39:13.746 --> 39:14.997
This?

39:15.205 --> 39:16.832
It's just a place.

39:18.625 --> 39:21.503
Yana and her family'll make
good use of it.

39:21.670 --> 39:23.630
They live off the land.

39:26.008 --> 39:27.176
More?

39:37.102 --> 39:40.606
About two months ago
I got a letter from San Francisco.

39:40.773 --> 39:44.735
A woman I'd loved very much

39:45.027 --> 39:47.488
died of tuberculosis.

39:48.447 --> 39:50.115
Left an only kid,

39:50.282 --> 39:52.910
a son I've never seen before.

39:56.622 --> 39:58.248
So I figured

40:02.836 --> 40:06.465
now might be a good time
to go back and pay him a visit.

40:06.632 --> 40:08.759
Keep each other company.

40:10.594 --> 40:14.556
Sometimes I think there's only
two moments in a man's life.

40:14.932 --> 40:18.602
One's when he leaves home.
The other one's when he returns.

40:19.144 --> 40:21.772
Everything else
is just in the middle.

40:23.399 --> 40:27.319
Well, it looks like we'll be headed
in different directions, won't we?

41:06.233 --> 41:07.609
Mr. James?

41:09.903 --> 41:10.821
Yana?

41:51.362 --> 41:52.154
Good morning.

41:54.406 --> 41:55.783
What do you want?

41:56.283 --> 41:58.994
We found your horse
in the desert four days ago.

42:01.163 --> 42:02.831
Where is he?

42:03.123 --> 42:04.124
He's dead.

42:04.291 --> 42:06.960
But we have your blankets
and your money.

42:09.797 --> 42:11.131
So?

42:12.383 --> 42:14.510
Where's your friend
the Spaniard?

42:20.933 --> 42:22.059
What friend?

42:22.226 --> 42:23.519
Fucking gringo!

45:33.417 --> 45:34.710
That's enough.

45:42.009 --> 45:44.803
All right,
let's get this over with. Go.

45:51.393 --> 45:52.311
Shit!

46:01.070 --> 46:03.405
Here, you might need to use this.

46:32.309 --> 46:33.978
Thanks for that.

46:44.071 --> 46:45.781
They're smart.

46:45.948 --> 46:48.409
Someone must have told them
we were together,

46:48.575 --> 46:51.870
so they sent two women
so we wouldn't suspect.

46:52.371 --> 46:56.291
When they realize they are not
coming back, they will come after us.

47:54.933 --> 47:56.727
He's waiting outside?

47:57.353 --> 47:58.437
Yeah.

48:00.147 --> 48:02.149
It's a long trip.

48:03.484 --> 48:05.277
If I made it here,
I can make it back.

48:09.073 --> 48:10.699
We all can.

48:13.994 --> 48:17.414
He'll forgive you.
You know what he's like.

48:17.665 --> 48:19.124
Nothing to forgive, Butch.

48:19.458 --> 48:21.251
I'm not walking out on you.

48:22.169 --> 48:24.588
I'm just defending what's ours.

48:38.894 --> 48:40.396
Come with me.

48:41.438 --> 48:43.941
Come on.
You're not young anymore.

48:46.694 --> 48:49.446
Truth be told, we're still losing.

48:50.614 --> 48:52.992
You'd never have any peace.

49:02.584 --> 49:04.044
I love you both.

49:07.339 --> 49:08.382
Tell him.

49:13.512 --> 49:14.138
Wait!

49:14.430 --> 49:16.015
What will you name it?

49:17.182 --> 49:18.183
Ryan.

49:40.456 --> 49:41.957
She'll come back.

49:42.416 --> 49:44.001
I know it.

49:44.877 --> 49:46.378
Of course.

49:47.713 --> 49:50.174
Who could stay away
from all this?

49:54.011 --> 49:57.097
If the world
from you withhold

49:57.306 --> 50:00.434
of its silver and its gold,

50:00.893 --> 50:04.980
And you have to get along
with meager fare,

50:06.523 --> 50:09.443
Just remember, in His Word,

50:09.610 --> 50:12.488
how He feeds the little bird;

50:12.655 --> 50:16.825
Take your burden to the Lord
and leave it there.

50:18.661 --> 50:20.412
Leave it there,

50:21.497 --> 50:23.540
oh, leave it there.

50:24.917 --> 50:27.795
Take your burden to the Lord

50:28.337 --> 50:29.880
and leave it there.

50:32.800 --> 50:35.135
The Uyuni Salt Flats.

50:37.638 --> 50:39.515
There's nothing more beautiful.

50:40.724 --> 50:42.518
It's like a sweet death.

50:43.435 --> 50:46.981
It's gonna be tough, but it's
the only way over those mountains.

50:47.564 --> 50:51.694
On the other side, I can catch me
a boat back home from Chile or Peru.

50:59.743 --> 51:01.370
Come on over here, son.

51:03.706 --> 51:04.873
Get down.

51:09.837 --> 51:11.422
Drop your pants.

51:11.964 --> 51:13.132
Are you nuts?

51:13.298 --> 51:16.260
If we don't heal
those saddle wounds, you can't ride.

51:16.427 --> 51:17.886
You're gonna die out here.

51:18.303 --> 51:19.972
Come on, turn around.

51:25.060 --> 51:26.353
You ready?

51:27.104 --> 51:29.523
This might sting a little bit.

51:38.073 --> 51:39.408
There you go.

51:39.825 --> 51:40.826
Fuck!

51:44.413 --> 51:47.666
Your ass is softer
than a bookkeeper's.

51:49.501 --> 51:50.669
Are you okay?

51:51.795 --> 51:52.796
Yeah.

51:56.800 --> 51:59.887
It's been a long time
since I've been out here.

52:02.389 --> 52:04.266
I like these places.

52:04.600 --> 52:06.477
They can't be used.

52:06.685 --> 52:07.853
They got no owners.

52:08.020 --> 52:09.229
But they will.

52:09.396 --> 52:10.731
That's how life works.

52:10.898 --> 52:13.651
I hope I'm dead when that day comes.

52:16.403 --> 52:17.571
James.

52:19.365 --> 52:20.783
I wanted to say...

52:20.949 --> 52:23.619
All that happened about Yana and...

52:25.204 --> 52:27.915
I knew the risks
as well as you, going in.

52:28.999 --> 52:31.085
There's nothing to say.

52:34.421 --> 52:36.340
Maybe we should
shelter up down there.

52:36.507 --> 52:38.050
It's gonna freeze tonight.

52:40.219 --> 52:43.472
These horses aren't gonna
last long at this altitude.

52:43.681 --> 52:45.307
No air, no water...

52:48.102 --> 52:50.187
What did you do in your country?

52:54.316 --> 52:56.777
I think you got
a pretty good idea, don't you?

53:02.366 --> 53:06.453
We covered more than six states,
back in the day.

53:09.748 --> 53:12.334
Some of 'em bigger
than this whole country.

53:14.169 --> 53:16.463
Of course things
were different back then.

53:16.630 --> 53:18.674
There was room for everybody.

53:21.385 --> 53:25.514
Then the railroad came in,
and big ranchers.

53:25.848 --> 53:27.599
Everything changed.

53:29.810 --> 53:32.313
It turned into a kind of a war.

53:33.522 --> 53:36.150
We ended up
on the losing end of the stick.

53:36.775 --> 53:38.068
And why Bolivia?

53:38.235 --> 53:42.323
It was far, far away.

53:43.699 --> 53:45.951
- Far away from what?
- Everything.

53:46.994 --> 53:48.162
See, one day...

53:50.748 --> 53:52.499
I woke up and...

53:54.376 --> 53:55.586
found myself alone.

53:56.211 --> 54:00.215
Seemed like everybody I knew
was either dead or in jail.

54:00.716 --> 54:03.385
They thought I was dead too.
So I just...

54:03.552 --> 54:05.929
did what any good dead person
would do.

54:06.138 --> 54:08.015
I went off
and raised me some horses.

54:09.642 --> 54:13.395
Twenty years!
That's a big change.

54:14.229 --> 54:15.856
Quiet times.

54:17.566 --> 54:21.737
I am too long in the tooth
to go off and be what I used to be,

54:21.904 --> 54:24.657
just an ordinary old bandit.

54:26.200 --> 54:28.494
You should have become
a rancher, too.

54:28.661 --> 54:31.914
You'd be rich now,
instead of being here with me.

54:32.998 --> 54:33.749
Rich?

54:35.542 --> 54:37.503
I've been my own man.

54:38.212 --> 54:39.922
Ain't nothing richer than that.

54:41.799 --> 54:43.759
Had some good friends, too.

54:52.434 --> 54:53.894
They don't sleep.

54:56.271 --> 54:59.733
Sure you killed a few
not so friendly in those days, huh?

55:00.192 --> 55:02.778
Me? I've never had to kill nobody.

55:03.237 --> 55:04.738
So far.

55:05.072 --> 55:06.907
Come on,
let's get these horses saddled up.

55:32.308 --> 55:34.643
They must be very well paid.

55:34.935 --> 55:37.938
I've never seen anybody
take so much punishment.

55:38.689 --> 55:40.983
We should never have tried
to cross the salt flats.

55:41.150 --> 55:42.276
It's the only way.

55:42.443 --> 55:45.279
Otherwise they'd have surrounded us
and we wouldn't even see it coming.

55:45.446 --> 55:48.615
This way,
all they can do is track us

55:48.991 --> 55:51.618
and see whose horses die first.

56:27.655 --> 56:29.948
Get the rifle and water.
Come on!

56:30.199 --> 56:31.283
Mount up!

56:38.666 --> 56:40.501
Come on! Let's go!

57:24.044 --> 57:25.587
Three men on horseback.

57:26.505 --> 57:28.799
We still have a few minutes.

57:31.010 --> 57:33.804
- We stand a chance here, right?
- I don't know.

57:37.766 --> 57:39.101
James.

57:39.435 --> 57:41.061
I'm glad I'm with you.

57:41.228 --> 57:45.316
You know, before I met you,
damn the day,

57:45.691 --> 57:49.403
I thought if I was gonna die of old age,
I might as well go back home to do it.

57:49.570 --> 57:50.529
But, Hell,

57:51.196 --> 57:53.991
this seems like as good a day
as any to die.

57:54.158 --> 57:56.994
- We're not gonna die, old man.
- Of course not, son.

57:57.161 --> 57:58.787
Nobody ever does.

57:59.079 --> 58:00.289
Just in case,

58:00.456 --> 58:03.459
we ought to bury this money before
PatiÃ±o gets his hands on it again.

58:04.418 --> 58:06.712
It is too late.
They're too close.

58:13.218 --> 58:16.055
They're gonna surround us.
They know we're here.

58:27.149 --> 58:28.942
Oh my God.

58:36.033 --> 58:37.743
What are we gonna do?

59:02.893 --> 59:04.561
All right, look.

59:05.104 --> 59:07.439
You take the good horse,
and the money.

59:07.606 --> 59:10.317
Head South-East,
you follow that mountain range.

59:10.567 --> 59:12.361
If you're lucky,
you'll wind up in Tupiza.

59:12.528 --> 59:13.153
What?

59:13.320 --> 59:15.614
I'm gonna take the other horse
and head South-West.

59:15.781 --> 59:18.242
Their horses have to be wiped out
by now. I'll meet you down there.

59:18.409 --> 59:20.452
- But...
- It's the only way to do it, splitting up.

59:20.619 --> 59:23.622
- They'll kill us!
- This desert'll kill you before they do.

59:25.249 --> 59:26.875
I don't want to be by myself.

59:27.042 --> 59:29.461
Your horse'll make it,
don't worry.

59:32.631 --> 59:35.551
Just remember: Southeast.

59:35.718 --> 59:38.762
And don't buy one of those goddam
mansions full of flowers, all right?

59:38.929 --> 59:40.597
You spend that money quick.

59:40.764 --> 59:41.682
But...

59:43.684 --> 59:45.019
Shit!

01:01:01.261 --> 01:01:02.304
Don't move.

01:01:05.099 --> 01:01:06.642
Don't move!

01:01:17.736 --> 01:01:19.780
Drop the gun, you son of a bitch.

01:03:04.677 --> 01:03:07.262
How many times did we go out

01:03:07.930 --> 01:03:10.516
hunting together, myfriend?

01:03:14.228 --> 01:03:15.270
Fucking Spaniard!

01:05:45.129 --> 01:05:46.588
Get on, Sundance.

01:05:51.802 --> 01:05:53.053
Ain't nobody following us.

01:05:53.971 --> 01:05:56.265
They think we're back
at the corral.

01:05:57.099 --> 01:05:58.809
The bullet's still inside.

01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:03.564
You think the Chilean
and the Yankee will make it?

01:06:03.731 --> 01:06:06.859
Or when they find their bodies,
they'll think they're us.

01:06:07.026 --> 01:06:08.152
Then, we're free.

01:06:09.570 --> 01:06:11.196
I like being dead.

01:06:11.363 --> 01:06:13.032
Hell, if I had only known sooner...

01:06:13.866 --> 01:06:15.451
Give me your hand, Sundance.

01:06:16.827 --> 01:06:20.080
I should've gone
with Etta and the boy.

01:06:21.290 --> 01:06:22.624
A son.

01:06:22.916 --> 01:06:26.879
That's more than a lot of people have
to say for themselves, don't you think?

01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:31.717
What makes you think
he's yours, you desert dog?

01:06:31.884 --> 01:06:33.385
It doesn't matter.

01:06:34.345 --> 01:06:35.679
He'll still be my son.

01:06:37.556 --> 01:06:39.016
Let's head for the mountains, Butch.

01:06:39.433 --> 01:06:41.977
We'll cross those mountains
and go home.

01:06:43.646 --> 01:06:45.648
Damn Bolivian Army.

01:06:46.273 --> 01:06:48.692
Worst aim I've ever seen.

01:07:20.015 --> 01:07:22.226
Goddamn little doctor!

01:07:22.726 --> 01:07:24.895
I told you I'll pay you.

01:07:25.062 --> 01:07:26.689
I was just fine in the bar!

01:07:26.855 --> 01:07:28.941
That's not why I called for you.

01:07:29.108 --> 01:07:31.485
Mr. Mackinley,
come in, come in.

01:07:36.448 --> 01:07:39.159
When you worked
for the Pinkertons,

01:07:39.326 --> 01:07:43.038
you came here to Bolivia
chasing bandits, right?

01:07:43.414 --> 01:07:45.165
Well, that's excellent!

01:07:45.416 --> 01:07:47.376
I found my memory!

01:07:47.543 --> 01:07:51.547
And it turns out it's
a goddamn Bolivian quack.

01:07:53.048 --> 01:07:55.843
If I remember right,
you always said

01:07:56.010 --> 01:08:00.055
the men they killed in San Vicente
weren't your bandits.

01:08:01.015 --> 01:08:04.476
Well, you might have been right.

01:08:06.437 --> 01:08:07.563
But...

01:08:07.813 --> 01:08:10.232
You're not too drunk, are you?

01:08:10.399 --> 01:08:12.109
Fuck off.

01:08:12.526 --> 01:08:13.819
Well,

01:08:14.111 --> 01:08:17.906
now we're going to see
if you were right or not.

01:08:19.158 --> 01:08:20.242
Look.

01:08:42.055 --> 01:08:43.724
Sweet Jesus.

01:08:46.685 --> 01:08:49.395
Sweet suffering Jesus, it's him.

01:08:49.563 --> 01:08:51.357
It's him, isn't it?

01:08:51.689 --> 01:08:52.733
Yes.

01:08:53.651 --> 01:08:55.819
Robert Leroy Parker.

01:08:56.819 --> 01:08:58.029
Butch Cassidy.

01:08:58.197 --> 01:09:01.325
All of them will apologize to me.

01:09:02.701 --> 01:09:04.578
All those bastards.

01:09:05.453 --> 01:09:06.747
What's he got?

01:09:07.288 --> 01:09:08.832
A bullet wound,

01:09:08.999 --> 01:09:12.127
dehydration and fatigue.

01:09:13.170 --> 01:09:14.962
He just needs to rest.

01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:20.176
Rest...

01:10:00.551 --> 01:10:02.428
Here we are.

01:10:09.935 --> 01:10:11.562
You and me.

01:10:27.578 --> 01:10:28.871
Water!

01:10:38.756 --> 01:10:41.091
You're in poor shape.

01:10:41.467 --> 01:10:44.720
Even worse than the last time
we saw each other.

01:10:47.306 --> 01:10:50.100
What the fuck are you doing
in Bolivia?

01:10:50.934 --> 01:10:53.228
Haven't you got
anything better to do?

01:10:53.395 --> 01:10:54.730
And where is my pistol?

01:10:59.818 --> 01:11:01.528
What should I call you?

01:11:03.238 --> 01:11:06.533
I've been going under Blackthorn.
Does it matter?

01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:07.868
It matters.

01:11:08.369 --> 01:11:10.245
Of course it does.

01:11:15.125 --> 01:11:17.127
I never believed
that you were dead, you know.

01:11:24.885 --> 01:11:26.971
Strange world.

01:11:27.888 --> 01:11:30.683
Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Blackthorn?

01:11:49.076 --> 01:11:51.829
I'm what they call
an honorary consul.

01:11:52.538 --> 01:11:54.039
89 dollars a month.

01:11:54.206 --> 01:11:58.377
A one-bedroom house
with a bed too small for my taste.

01:12:00.087 --> 01:12:04.258
I just greet the few North Americans
that show up around here.

01:12:05.342 --> 01:12:07.344
Gold diggers,
people buying wool,

01:12:07.511 --> 01:12:09.555
drunkards,
an occasional runaway.

01:12:09.763 --> 01:12:12.016
Not many people.

01:12:13.934 --> 01:12:16.186
The last one came by...

01:12:17.938 --> 01:12:20.065
two winters past.

01:12:21.525 --> 01:12:24.194
I spend the rest of time
looking out the window.

01:12:25.946 --> 01:12:28.282
Sad story.
Not much of a life.

01:12:28.449 --> 01:12:29.992
No, it's not.

01:12:30.159 --> 01:12:32.953
But I couldn't aspire
to much more...

01:12:35.414 --> 01:12:36.623
Until today.

01:12:38.417 --> 01:12:42.588
Last night I thought
everything could change for me.

01:12:44.131 --> 01:12:47.051
I could even buy a huge bed

01:12:47.217 --> 01:12:48.969
and travel home on it,

01:12:49.136 --> 01:12:52.097
smiling and waving

01:12:52.306 --> 01:12:53.807
as I passed.

01:12:57.186 --> 01:13:00.731
But, Mr. Blackthorn,

01:13:01.273 --> 01:13:04.818
these past few hours at your side

01:13:05.152 --> 01:13:08.155
have reminded me of many things.

01:13:08.989 --> 01:13:10.866
The fatigue.

01:13:11.033 --> 01:13:14.036
The years of pursuit...

01:13:15.788 --> 01:13:18.290
Carrying out one's duty is,

01:13:19.541 --> 01:13:21.085
believe me,

01:13:22.336 --> 01:13:24.254
exhausting.

01:13:27.132 --> 01:13:30.803
Here, in this godforsaken village,

01:13:31.512 --> 01:13:33.681
I finally found some rest.

01:13:35.265 --> 01:13:36.934
A stupid, but

01:13:37.685 --> 01:13:39.645
well deserved rest.

01:13:40.437 --> 01:13:41.814
Yeah.

01:13:43.524 --> 01:13:46.527
I guess we can't be blamed
for growing older.

01:13:47.069 --> 01:13:49.571
We're too old to keep on playing.

01:13:50.531 --> 01:13:52.324
Never was a game with me.

01:13:52.491 --> 01:13:54.201
Of course it was.

01:13:54.827 --> 01:13:57.746
An absurd, deadly game.

01:13:58.539 --> 01:14:00.749
You never understood.
Doesn't matter.

01:14:01.291 --> 01:14:04.211
Of course I understood.
I was part of the game.

01:14:04.795 --> 01:14:06.588
But this time...

01:14:06.839 --> 01:14:08.382
There's no handcuffs either.

01:14:08.549 --> 01:14:10.259
This time you're on your own.

01:14:11.635 --> 01:14:13.887
No one will come to the rescue.

01:14:15.806 --> 01:14:17.975
Do whatever you need to do.

01:14:34.867 --> 01:14:35.993
Take it.

01:14:37.703 --> 01:14:41.373
Consider it
a way to continue resting.

01:14:50.424 --> 01:14:53.469
An Army battalion
is on its way here.

01:14:53.636 --> 01:14:55.262
I sent for them.

01:14:55.429 --> 01:14:58.432
This is the most important thing
to have happened around here since...

01:14:58.974 --> 01:15:01.060
Well, since your death.

01:15:04.229 --> 01:15:07.149
I'll get you to a safe place.
You'll leave

01:15:08.817 --> 01:15:10.569
and you'll never come back.

01:15:12.655 --> 01:15:15.866
Things will still be the same.

01:15:19.870 --> 01:15:22.623
You're a right pain in the ass,
Cassidy.

01:15:22.998 --> 01:15:26.960
A right fucking pain in the ass!

01:15:31.006 --> 01:15:32.466
We're here.

01:15:43.644 --> 01:15:45.354
There's food and chicha in here.

01:15:45.521 --> 01:15:46.563
Thanks.

01:15:50.109 --> 01:15:51.777
I know what you are, sir.

01:15:53.195 --> 01:15:55.197
Please, don't steal from me.

01:15:59.702 --> 01:16:01.078
IvÃ¡n...

01:16:01.829 --> 01:16:04.164
You won't say anything,
will you?

01:16:04.331 --> 01:16:07.459
No, sir. You're my guest.

01:17:28.624 --> 01:17:29.917
Dear Ryan,

01:17:30.668 --> 01:17:33.796
I have enough money now for us
to start a brand new life.

01:17:34.046 --> 01:17:35.923
Maybe horses, ranching...

01:17:36.590 --> 01:17:39.093
I've met an old friend
of your father and mother's,

01:17:39.259 --> 01:17:40.761
he remembers them often.

01:17:41.178 --> 01:17:44.765
They were one of a kind. There's
not much blood like yours left.

01:17:45.641 --> 01:17:47.434
I'm on my way back.

01:17:47.893 --> 01:17:50.646
I don't know how long it will take,
not more than two months.

01:17:51.105 --> 01:17:53.816
With love, your Uncle Butch.

01:17:56.694 --> 01:17:58.278
I was just writing about you.

01:18:00.072 --> 01:18:02.157
I should have left you
at the damn clinic.

01:18:03.075 --> 01:18:05.244
Eduardo Apodaca

01:18:05.786 --> 01:18:08.288
- is a friend of yours?
- Have you seen him? Where is he?

01:18:08.455 --> 01:18:10.165
He's heading West
through the canyons.

01:18:10.332 --> 01:18:11.750
He was in Tupiza,

01:18:11.917 --> 01:18:16.088
but made himself scarce when he saw
the uproar caused by your resurrection.

01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:18.090
I haven't betrayed you,

01:18:18.882 --> 01:18:20.426
but my help stops here.

01:18:21.176 --> 01:18:23.387
What the hell are you talking about?

01:18:27.308 --> 01:18:28.684
Damn chicha.

01:18:30.185 --> 01:18:31.520
Is it money you're after?

01:18:32.271 --> 01:18:35.190
You can stick
your dirty money where it fits.

01:18:35.607 --> 01:18:39.445
You were better off dead, Cassidy.
And I hope you soon will be.

01:18:40.904 --> 01:18:42.698
I'll drink until I forget this.

01:18:43.073 --> 01:18:44.700
But for you,

01:18:45.284 --> 01:18:48.537
all the liquor in this shitty
world wouldn't be enough.

01:18:51.457 --> 01:18:54.668
In my day, the outlaws
would have robbed banks!

01:18:54.835 --> 01:18:56.712
And the Union Pacific!

01:18:57.129 --> 01:19:00.633
They would never have stolen
from the mining families, no sir!

01:19:00.966 --> 01:19:04.345
Mining families? You better
get off the bottle, MacKinley!

01:19:04.511 --> 01:19:06.972
- You're losing your Irish mind.
- Go to Hell!

01:19:07.181 --> 01:19:08.891
He never stole
from the miner families.

01:19:09.433 --> 01:19:12.519
It's PatiÃ±o, the Suyana Mine.

01:19:13.103 --> 01:19:14.188
You believe that?

01:19:15.105 --> 01:19:17.608
He tricked you
and into believing that?

01:19:17.775 --> 01:19:20.277
Jesus, I almost pity you.

01:19:21.153 --> 01:19:23.572
Your Spanish friend
didn't work for PatiÃ±o.

01:19:23.739 --> 01:19:25.115
He worked for the miners.

01:19:25.532 --> 01:19:27.076
The mine is theirs.

01:19:27.242 --> 01:19:29.495
They took it from PatiÃ±o
two years ago.

01:19:29.662 --> 01:19:33.832
What rock were you hiding under?
The whole country was talking about it!

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.336
The miners rebelled
against the owners.

01:19:37.503 --> 01:19:39.964
Overdue wages, murders...
The usual.

01:19:40.130 --> 01:19:43.509
There was a huge battle.
A lot of miners got killed.

01:19:44.843 --> 01:19:47.554
Then Justice stepped in and,

01:19:47.763 --> 01:19:49.306
this country is full of surprises,

01:19:49.807 --> 01:19:51.934
they decided
in favor of the miners.

01:19:52.393 --> 01:19:55.938
They awarded ownership of the
mine to the surviving families.

01:19:56.313 --> 01:19:58.190
This is no coincidence,
of course.

01:19:58.732 --> 01:20:00.693
The mine was almost empty.

01:20:01.527 --> 01:20:05.572
Even the Spanish engineer who worked
for PatiÃ±o stood up for them.

01:20:06.490 --> 01:20:09.118
Poor fools,
they trusted a Spaniard!

01:20:14.415 --> 01:20:17.334
There are times
when you'd prefer to be dead,

01:20:18.377 --> 01:20:20.170
don't you agree?

01:20:24.675 --> 01:20:27.803
Goodbye and good riddance,
Mr. Blackthorn.

01:21:32.326 --> 01:21:33.285
Here you go, sir.

01:21:38.666 --> 01:21:41.585
We'll catch him.
He can't be far away.

01:21:43.253 --> 01:21:45.589
Or what do you think, Mackinley?

01:21:55.849 --> 01:21:56.976
No.

01:21:57.851 --> 01:21:58.936
It's not him.

01:21:59.103 --> 01:22:01.313
It's not the one
who escaped from the clinic.

01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:03.273
Cassidy died years ago.

01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:06.860
Are you crazy, Mackinley?
You recognized him yourself!

01:22:07.277 --> 01:22:08.737
It wasn't him.

01:22:09.697 --> 01:22:11.073
Of course it's him!

01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:14.868
This is the man I left
in my clinic, with you.

01:22:15.035 --> 01:22:17.621
You're a fucking sentimentalist.

01:22:21.709 --> 01:22:23.335
Mackinley.

01:22:26.463 --> 01:22:29.383
We're going to see
if you're right or not.

01:22:30.592 --> 01:22:32.303
We'll leave at dawn.

01:22:32.845 --> 01:22:34.430
And you're coming with us.

01:24:41.598 --> 01:24:43.475
Come on. Let's go, Kid.

01:24:49.606 --> 01:24:50.899
Shit.

01:24:55.988 --> 01:24:59.742
- You'll get my suit dirty.
- It'll help keep you warm.

01:25:08.751 --> 01:25:12.046
Everybody will think we're dead,
and look at us!

01:25:12.755 --> 01:25:14.423
Strong as trees.

01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:18.469
Snow covered trees.

01:25:21.764 --> 01:25:23.098
Bolivia...

01:25:25.434 --> 01:25:26.977
Goddamnit, Bolivia.

01:25:29.146 --> 01:25:31.732
I always knew you'd be the last.

01:25:33.776 --> 01:25:35.861
Everybody's dead and you...

01:25:36.945 --> 01:25:39.114
You're all alone now.

01:25:39.865 --> 01:25:41.867
So far from home.

01:25:43.786 --> 01:25:45.663
My poor friend.

01:25:50.626 --> 01:25:51.877
Okay...

01:25:53.170 --> 01:25:54.505
Do it.

01:25:59.551 --> 01:26:01.428
Now is a good time.

01:26:03.681 --> 01:26:04.807
Do it.

01:26:59.987 --> 01:27:01.363
James.

01:27:04.867 --> 01:27:06.660
Or should I say Butch?

01:27:07.411 --> 01:27:09.663
Mr. Butch Cassidy, himself!

01:27:10.748 --> 01:27:11.874
I knew it.

01:27:12.583 --> 01:27:14.418
That explains so many things.

01:27:14.752 --> 01:27:16.003
You know what?

01:27:16.253 --> 01:27:19.715
In Tupiza everyone was shouting

01:27:19.882 --> 01:27:22.635
that the famous gringo outlaw
was alive.

01:27:22.801 --> 01:27:24.928
And me buying new clothes!

01:27:25.638 --> 01:27:27.222
Can you imagine?

01:27:28.599 --> 01:27:29.600
Take it easy.

01:27:29.767 --> 01:27:31.644
They must have lost a lot of time.

01:27:41.528 --> 01:27:43.989
So... Here we are.

01:27:44.698 --> 01:27:48.243
Just a few hours from freedom
and the good life.

01:27:50.371 --> 01:27:51.163
Are you okay?

01:27:52.039 --> 01:27:54.667
You can't think
I abandoned you, right?

01:27:54.833 --> 01:27:57.878
I just couldn't stay there
with so much going on.

01:27:58.045 --> 01:28:00.130
And I knew you'd turn up.

01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:05.386
That mine didn't belong to PatiÃ±o.

01:28:20.275 --> 01:28:22.194
And your name
is not James Blackthorn.

01:28:24.488 --> 01:28:27.324
Well, we all have our secrets.

01:28:27.491 --> 01:28:30.285
But now all the cards
are on the table.

01:28:32.454 --> 01:28:35.082
No, you're right.
It wasn't his any longer.

01:28:35.249 --> 01:28:36.583
So what?

01:28:37.876 --> 01:28:39.336
It had different owners.

01:28:39.712 --> 01:28:41.588
Owners, anyway.

01:28:42.923 --> 01:28:45.050
50,000 dollars, James.

01:28:45.384 --> 01:28:47.428
That's no lie.
Come on!

01:28:47.594 --> 01:28:48.512
Let's go!

01:28:48.679 --> 01:28:52.474
Look, there are your mountains.
We're almost there.

01:28:52.850 --> 01:28:55.561
I'll be your gang now.
You and me, James...

01:28:55.728 --> 01:28:56.770
You and me!

01:28:56.937 --> 01:28:59.440
You said it yourself:
You were dead,

01:28:59.606 --> 01:29:01.942
breeding horses in that old house.

01:29:02.109 --> 01:29:05.779
Now you have money
and you have it all. Your name.

01:29:05.946 --> 01:29:08.490
Your life!
You're a damn legend

01:29:08.657 --> 01:29:10.200
and here you are.

01:29:10.868 --> 01:29:12.453
Here you are!

01:29:14.038 --> 01:29:15.456
Here I am.

01:29:25.841 --> 01:29:27.426
Have you gone crazy?

01:29:28.636 --> 01:29:30.429
Motherfucker!

01:29:31.430 --> 01:29:32.723
They'll be here shortly.

01:29:33.223 --> 01:29:36.185
- This time they've got the Army with them.
- But you shoot me!

01:29:37.478 --> 01:29:38.604
Son of a bitch!

01:29:45.486 --> 01:29:47.279
Is it the money?

01:29:48.322 --> 01:29:50.658
How can you, bastard!

01:29:50.991 --> 01:29:53.619
You never did see
the difference, did you?

01:29:58.582 --> 01:30:01.835
For the Indians?
For a bunch of miners?

01:30:02.002 --> 01:30:04.880
For them?
And what about me?

01:30:05.839 --> 01:30:07.716
I'm your friend!

01:30:08.175 --> 01:30:11.095
I gave you everything!
Everything!

01:30:11.345 --> 01:30:13.472
I saved your life!

01:30:13.681 --> 01:30:16.266
I gave you your name back!
I did!

01:30:16.433 --> 01:30:19.687
Difference?
What's the fucking difference?

01:30:19.853 --> 01:30:21.647
What's the fucking difference?

01:30:36.704 --> 01:30:40.332
Are you going to leave me
like this, you son of a bitch?

01:30:41.834 --> 01:30:43.419
Are you?

01:30:46.255 --> 01:30:47.339
Okay.

01:30:47.715 --> 01:30:48.841
Okay!

01:30:50.759 --> 01:30:52.344
Give the money back to them.

01:30:52.511 --> 01:30:54.179
Give the money back to them,

01:30:54.346 --> 01:30:56.640
but don't leave me here, please.

01:31:00.227 --> 01:31:01.478
Please.

01:31:11.905 --> 01:31:13.907
Damn you, Butch Cassidy!

01:31:14.742 --> 01:31:16.327
Damn you!

01:31:16.994 --> 01:31:18.996
I could have killed you!

01:31:19.496 --> 01:31:21.749
I could have killed you

01:31:22.666 --> 01:31:24.710
and I didn't.

01:31:28.797 --> 01:31:30.841
But they'll do it for me!

01:31:31.258 --> 01:31:32.885
They'll track you down

01:31:33.302 --> 01:31:36.055
and kill you like a dog!

01:31:43.562 --> 01:31:46.357
Don't leave me here, please.

01:32:02.998 --> 01:32:06.627
To the gallows I must go,

01:32:07.503 --> 01:32:09.421
I must go.

01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:15.219
To the gallows I must go.

01:32:27.231 --> 01:32:30.693
To the gallows I must go.

01:32:44.540 --> 01:32:46.000
Bolivia.

01:32:46.375 --> 01:32:50.004
Damnit! Bolivia.

01:33:18.032 --> 01:33:20.284
I'm just a poor

01:33:22.161 --> 01:33:24.580
wayfaring stranger,

01:33:26.665 --> 01:33:29.293
While traveling

01:33:30.252 --> 01:33:32.838
through this world below.

01:33:34.798 --> 01:33:37.092
Yet there's no sickness,

01:33:38.093 --> 01:33:40.512
no toil, nor danger,

01:33:42.723 --> 01:33:45.309
In that bright land

01:33:46.602 --> 01:33:48.520
to which I go.

01:33:48.687 --> 01:33:50.189
We're not done yet.

01:33:50.522 --> 01:33:51.774
We'll continue.

01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:53.901
I'm going there

01:33:54.610 --> 01:33:56.695
to see my father,

01:33:58.781 --> 01:34:01.033
I'm goin' there

01:34:02.534 --> 01:34:05.371
no more to roam.

01:34:06.705 --> 01:34:08.165
I'm just going

01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:12.878
over Jordan.

01:34:15.464 --> 01:34:17.341
I'm just going

01:34:19.259 --> 01:34:21.053
over home.

01:34:22.930 --> 01:34:25.391
I'm just going

01:34:26.809 --> 01:34:28.143
over Jordan.

01:34:30.729 --> 01:34:32.982
I'm just going

01:34:34.733 --> 01:34:38.070
over home.

01:34:46.662 --> 01:34:48.622
You know what, Mackinley?

01:34:49.707 --> 01:34:53.585
This place is famous
for how easy it is to get lost.

01:34:54.878 --> 01:34:56.922
You helped the gringo.

01:34:59.174 --> 01:35:01.552
We'll take your horse.

01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:07.182
So pray the God of the Mountains
spares your life.
