WEBVTT

00:15.766 --> 00:19.134
(exhales sharply)

00:21.522 --> 00:23.104
You know what it is.

00:30.614 --> 00:33.026
You were supposed to.

00:34.785 --> 00:35.900
No.

00:35.994 --> 00:37.359
You were supposed to!

00:40.290 --> 00:42.531
No!

00:42.626 --> 00:45.744
(insects, birds chirping)

00:54.179 --> 00:57.092
(horn blaring in distance)

01:02.980 --> 01:05.642
(horn honks)

01:07.067 --> 01:08.398
(horn honks)

01:08.485 --> 01:10.351
(blaring continues)

01:10.445 --> 01:12.231
(horn honks)

01:15.742 --> 01:18.655
(air horn blows)

01:23.959 --> 01:26.041
It's on.

01:30.257 --> 01:32.294
(indistinct chatter)

01:36.013 --> 01:38.095
Can I have that
for when they come?

01:41.351 --> 01:43.809
This is not your lot.

01:43.895 --> 01:45.806
You will stay inside,
young Henry,

01:45.897 --> 01:47.763
with the others
till it's done.

01:47.858 --> 01:49.189
But I need to help.
I need to fight.

01:49.276 --> 01:51.187
No.
You do not.

01:51.278 --> 01:53.565
You need to stay inside
and guard this place.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.145
You will live and help others
do the same.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.321
Carol.

01:57.701 --> 01:59.908
You know I can help.

01:59.995 --> 02:03.329
Henry, if you go out there
during the attack, you'll die.

02:09.795 --> 02:11.787
Protect them.

02:19.723 --> 02:21.805
(hammer pounding in distance)

02:25.312 --> 02:28.725
Not there.
Those go in the corner.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.431
What'd you say
your specialty was?

02:30.525 --> 02:32.562
I was a second year
EM resident at--

02:32.653 --> 02:34.564
So you have never
performed surgery.

02:34.655 --> 02:35.861
Three times.

02:35.947 --> 02:37.062
Amputations?

02:37.157 --> 02:38.647
No, but I can figure it out.

02:38.742 --> 02:39.903
Are you even strong enough
to hold someone down

02:39.993 --> 02:41.358
who hasn't been
anesthetized?

02:41.453 --> 02:42.864
(exhales sharply)

02:42.954 --> 02:44.115
I can figure it out.

02:44.206 --> 02:46.288
Dana:
Can you shoot a gun?

02:46.375 --> 02:47.410
More importantly,
can you shoot a gun

02:47.501 --> 02:49.208
while you're holding
someone down?

02:49.294 --> 02:50.784
I'm pretty sure
I know enough to--

02:50.879 --> 02:52.586
(chuckling) Really?

02:52.673 --> 02:55.256
'Cause it sounds to me like you
don't know enough of anything.

02:55.342 --> 02:57.128
And in my experience,
people who don't know enough

02:57.219 --> 02:59.176
are more dangerous than people
who don't know shit.

02:59.262 --> 03:02.505
There's a lot I haven't done,
I know that,

03:02.599 --> 03:04.260
but from my first day
at the hospital

03:04.351 --> 03:06.558
to this moment right now,

03:06.645 --> 03:10.604
all I've done are things
I've never done.

03:10.691 --> 03:14.309
There are people coming,
right now, to hurt this place,

03:14.403 --> 03:16.235
and I'm standing here
ready to help.

03:16.321 --> 03:17.527
(door slams)

03:17.614 --> 03:21.323
So stop asking me
what I've done

03:21.410 --> 03:23.651
and start telling me
what to do

03:23.745 --> 03:26.533
besides where to put
the damn blankets.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.458
I like you.

03:33.588 --> 03:35.170
Get ready.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.621
Here we go.

04:13.712 --> 04:16.625
(theme music playing)

04:55.045 --> 04:57.787
(engines rumbling)

05:02.344 --> 05:05.132
(brakes squeal)

05:16.149 --> 05:18.732
Simon: Well, here I was hoping
to give that gate

05:18.819 --> 05:22.062
a big ol' wet, sloppy kiss,

05:22.155 --> 05:24.317
and there she goes,
playing hard to get.

05:24.407 --> 05:26.068
Arat, Gary,

05:26.159 --> 05:28.867
remove these offending
articles from the road.

05:28.954 --> 05:31.161
The sun is down.

05:31.248 --> 05:32.784
I'm tired of waiting.

05:32.874 --> 05:35.286
Maggie on walkie talkie:
Negan. <i>I</i> want to talk to Negan.

05:39.089 --> 05:40.329
- (walkie-talkie clicks)
- Well, hello there.

05:40.423 --> 05:42.255
You are speaking to Negan,

05:42.342 --> 05:44.549
but my birth certificate
says "Simon."

05:44.636 --> 05:48.174
With whom do I have the distinct
displeasure of speaking?

05:48.265 --> 05:50.882
- (walkie-talkie clicks)
- Maggie.

05:50.976 --> 05:52.808
Maggie Rhee.

05:52.894 --> 05:54.100
The Widow.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.724
(walkie-talkie clicks)
Well, <i>then.</i>

05:56.815 --> 05:58.977
Hello again, Widow Rhee,

05:59.067 --> 06:02.276
and allow me to offer
my condolences.

06:02.362 --> 06:05.730
For what's happened
and what's about to happen.

06:05.824 --> 06:07.531
In case it's not already plain
as Hilltop potatoes,

06:07.617 --> 06:09.483
yours truly is speaking

06:09.578 --> 06:12.570
on behalf of Negan
this go 'round.

06:12.664 --> 06:15.076
And I assure you
that the man himself

06:15.166 --> 06:18.409
personally received your care
package next day delivery.

06:18.503 --> 06:19.834
I noticed it was the box

06:19.921 --> 06:22.003
that I gave you
in good faith--

06:22.090 --> 06:24.127
trick's on me.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.753
But the bill's come due,

06:25.844 --> 06:29.132
and you and your people
are gonna have to pay.

06:29.222 --> 06:32.681
<i>Quite dearly, I'm afraid.</i>

06:32.767 --> 06:34.007
(walkie-talkie clicks)

06:34.102 --> 06:36.935
Your 38 people
are alive and breathing.

06:38.940 --> 06:42.308
Turn around and leave us be,
and they stay that way.

06:42.402 --> 06:45.565
But if you don't,
I have 38 bullets

06:45.655 --> 06:48.272
that I will personally fire
into all 38.

06:50.243 --> 06:53.281
(walkie-talkie clicks)

06:53.371 --> 06:56.739
It's too nice a night to spend it
dyin' slow, don't you think, Simon?

06:56.833 --> 06:58.073
(walkie-talkie clicks)

06:58.168 --> 07:01.035
(sighs)

07:01.129 --> 07:02.836
<i>How's this gonna go?</i>

07:02.923 --> 07:04.163
(walkie-talkie clicks)

07:04.257 --> 07:07.375
Well, Maggie Rhee,

07:07.469 --> 07:10.086
this is highly regrettable,
but the way I see it,

07:10.180 --> 07:12.842
the Saviors you're in
possession of there

07:12.933 --> 07:14.469
are damaged goods.

07:14.559 --> 07:19.099
<i>You know, they've got themselves
into their own pickle,</i>

07:19.189 --> 07:22.432
<i>and this organization
prizes those who, "A,"</i>

07:22.525 --> 07:24.641
avoid capture

07:24.736 --> 07:27.819
and' "B,"
figure out their own shit

07:27.906 --> 07:29.863
when said outcome
eventuates.

07:29.950 --> 07:34.444
Which, in the end,
is my way of saying screw them.

07:34.537 --> 07:35.948
(walkie-talkie clicks)

07:36.039 --> 07:38.622
Did you really think
that cockamamie play would work?

07:43.296 --> 07:46.709
It will.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.586
All right, people.

07:48.677 --> 07:50.793
Let's get
this party started.

07:50.887 --> 07:53.424
And though we do not come
bearing munitions,

07:53.515 --> 07:56.223
remember--
the plan has changed.

07:56.309 --> 07:59.722
Our goal is not merely
infection-- it is conclusion.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.145
We are doing away
with these people.

08:02.232 --> 08:03.848
All of 'em.

08:03.942 --> 08:06.183
This isn't what he'd want.

08:09.072 --> 08:11.814
(vehicle door opens)

08:11.908 --> 08:14.570
You know that, right?

08:14.661 --> 08:15.822
He could still be out there.

08:15.912 --> 08:17.494
(vehicle door closes)

08:19.958 --> 08:22.916
You sure you wanna face that
with him if he shows?

08:26.256 --> 08:29.499
Better to beg forgiveness
than ask permission, D.

08:29.592 --> 08:30.798
Future problems.

08:30.885 --> 08:33.001
(vehicle approaches)

08:33.096 --> 08:34.336
(gunfire)

08:40.645 --> 08:43.477
Simon: Go! Through the gate
before the assholes close it!

08:59.122 --> 09:00.203
NQW!

09:00.290 --> 09:02.201
(gunfire)

09:11.551 --> 09:13.292
(groans)

09:14.471 --> 09:15.632
(gunfire continues)

09:20.018 --> 09:21.725
Boys in back, light 'em up!

09:24.522 --> 09:26.263
Ohm

09:31.654 --> 09:33.861
Take the prisoners to my office.
Hold 'em there 'til it's done.

09:33.948 --> 09:37.111
Let's go. Go. Inside!
Get inside!

09:37.202 --> 09:39.534
I can help you defend
this place.

09:39.621 --> 09:40.907
I want to.

09:40.997 --> 09:42.738
Please, Maggie.

09:42.832 --> 09:45.039
You think I got a reason
to be loyal to these people?

09:46.503 --> 09:47.743
Maggie" you coming?

09:47.837 --> 09:50.454
Where the hell is he?

09:50.548 --> 09:53.836
Lookouts, fall back!
Front line, give 'em cover!

09:53.927 --> 09:56.794
(gunfire continues)

10:02.227 --> 10:04.685
<i>"</i> Ohh!
- (gfoans)

10:14.489 --> 10:16.321
(grunting)

10:16.407 --> 10:18.489
'Ohh!
_ <9"! Hts)

10:18.576 --> 10:22.114
(gunfire continues)

10:24.124 --> 10:27.037
(indistinct shouting
in distance)

10:36.052 --> 10:37.542
Long time, no see.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.800
It's okay.
I'm here.

10:43.518 --> 10:46.510
(gunfire continues)

10:46.604 --> 10:49.392
I'll take out sunshine
around the corner.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.726
- Unless you want her, D.
- No.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.151
Well, how 'bout
the next one, then?

10:55.238 --> 10:57.320
I'm gonna need
a group effort here.

10:57.407 --> 10:59.273
Go.

10:59.367 --> 11:00.983
I'll stay with him.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.662
Hey.
Hey, hey. Hey.

11:09.752 --> 11:12.369
(gunfire continues)

11:32.984 --> 11:35.726
Tara!

11:39.532 --> 11:42.775
(gunfire continues)

11:45.163 --> 11:47.074
(bullets ricocheting)

11:47.165 --> 11:49.748
(glass shatters)

11:56.049 --> 11:58.006
Michonne:
Daryl, it's time.

11:58.092 --> 12:00.424
Maggie gave the signal.
We gotta go.

12:00.511 --> 12:03.378
(gunfire continues)

12:03.473 --> 12:05.214
Daryl!

12:18.529 --> 12:20.440
(glass shatters)

12:20.531 --> 12:22.442
(gunfire stops)

12:47.767 --> 12:52.307
Simon: I can't see shit.

12:52.397 --> 12:54.388
(insects chirping)

13:07.370 --> 13:10.078
These people have run before.

13:13.084 --> 13:14.825
Arat, take a team around back.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.626
I want the place surrounded.

13:16.713 --> 13:19.796
Gary, your group goes
for the trailers.

13:19.882 --> 13:23.341
- Slow and quiet, capiche?
- Yeah.

13:26.973 --> 13:29.340
The rest of us?

13:31.227 --> 13:34.936
The rest of us are making
a house call.

13:35.023 --> 13:39.392
Well, if anybody's home...

13:39.485 --> 13:43.149
it's time to do
some proper slaughtering.

13:45.366 --> 13:47.448
(whistling)

13:59.505 --> 14:02.497
(whistling continues)

14:03.926 --> 14:05.837
(gunfire)

14:05.928 --> 14:07.089
God damn it, no!

14:07.180 --> 14:10.423
- Back to the trucks!
- Go! Go! Go!

14:12.685 --> 14:14.596
(indistinct shouting)

14:19.776 --> 14:22.768
(gunfire continues)

14:31.788 --> 14:33.699
(gun clicking)

14:36.876 --> 14:38.913
Man: Move! Move!

14:39.003 --> 14:40.914
Keep moving!

14:47.261 --> 14:50.003
(body thuds)

14:50.098 --> 14:52.009
(grunts)

14:55.061 --> 14:56.802
(grunts)

14:56.896 --> 14:58.227
(gasps)

14:58.314 --> 14:59.645
Just stay down.

14:59.732 --> 15:02.474
(gunfire continues)

15:04.862 --> 15:07.354
(body thuds)

15:07.448 --> 15:08.904
You know what it is.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.902
(gunfire continues)

15:16.499 --> 15:18.581
You know what it is!

15:18.668 --> 15:21.205
(engine starts)

15:34.725 --> 15:37.183
(gun clicks)

15:37.270 --> 15:39.978
(breathing heavily)

15:47.738 --> 15:50.856
I wanted them dead.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.111
All of them.

15:52.201 --> 15:55.660
Negan most of all.

15:55.746 --> 15:58.204
Yeah.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.498
Me too.

16:02.378 --> 16:04.119
Did you see him?

16:04.213 --> 16:05.829
He wasn't here.

16:05.923 --> 16:09.461
I saw him out there.

16:09.552 --> 16:11.589
I broke away
and tried to kill him.

16:11.679 --> 16:13.716
(breathing heavily)

16:13.806 --> 16:18.642
I didn't, but I tried.

16:23.941 --> 16:27.150
(sniffles)
Thank you.

16:34.744 --> 16:36.906
(walkers growling)

16:48.049 --> 16:51.258
We don't have the resources
to fight off another attack.

16:51.344 --> 16:52.834
Be ready to go.

16:54.764 --> 16:57.631
Hey.
You shouldn't be out here.

16:57.725 --> 16:59.762
Oh, it's just--
it's just a scratch.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.013
I can help.

17:01.103 --> 17:02.685
What if it wasn't?

17:02.772 --> 17:04.308
Then it'd be my own
damn fault.

17:04.397 --> 17:05.762
He's back with them
because of me.

17:05.858 --> 17:09.067
No, he's back with 'em
'cause that's who he is.

17:09.153 --> 17:10.939
We-- We got lucky.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.488
Finding Maggie... Rick.

17:13.574 --> 17:15.109
It could've been different.

17:15.201 --> 17:18.319
It was, for me,
when I was with the Governor.

17:18.412 --> 17:21.154
Yeah, but you weren't
one of 'em.

17:21.249 --> 17:24.037
But I was with them.

17:24.126 --> 17:25.207
Your brother, too.

17:25.294 --> 17:26.829
My brother?

17:26.921 --> 17:29.162
My brother ran the wrong way
his whole life.

17:29.257 --> 17:31.373
If he were here, if I stuck
with him when he left,

17:31.467 --> 17:33.049
we'd be
with the Saviors, too,

17:33.135 --> 17:35.752
or some other group
just like 'em.

17:35.846 --> 17:38.133
But I'd have figured out
who they were just like you did.

17:39.809 --> 17:41.641
Maybe that's what happened
to Dwight.

17:41.727 --> 17:43.809
Is that before or after
he killed your girl?

17:45.106 --> 17:48.098
Or is that all square now?

17:49.694 --> 17:52.311
It is.

17:52.405 --> 17:55.397
Look, I might hate him forever,
but he saved my life.

17:55.491 --> 17:58.324
No, he tried
to kill you last night.

17:58.411 --> 18:00.823
When we were in the woods,
when we were coming here,

18:00.913 --> 18:02.654
I saw him try
and help us win.

18:02.748 --> 18:06.036
Yeah.
I saw what I saw, too.

18:09.005 --> 18:11.747
(wood creaks)

18:11.841 --> 18:15.209
(boards clatter)

18:22.643 --> 18:24.554
(board creaks)

18:27.982 --> 18:31.225
Saved you this turnip.

18:31.319 --> 18:33.310
Yeah. I'm okay.

18:33.404 --> 18:35.441
(board creaking)

18:35.531 --> 18:37.442
(grunts)

18:39.160 --> 18:41.652
(sighs)

18:41.746 --> 18:43.407
(board thuds)

18:46.834 --> 18:48.245
Rick...

18:48.336 --> 18:52.000
Maggie turned off the generators
to save on gas.

18:52.089 --> 18:54.046
The kids are gonna need air
in this heat.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.044
(wood creaks)

19:02.767 --> 19:04.678
(board thuds)

19:08.564 --> 19:11.431
Can I take a look
at that cut?

19:11.525 --> 19:14.392
I have some stuff
to clean it.

19:14.487 --> 19:17.070
Let me get
this done first.

19:23.829 --> 19:25.740
(board thuds)

19:43.599 --> 19:45.431
I saw him
at the back of the convoy.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.475
That's why I did it.

19:50.106 --> 19:52.518
(sighs)

19:52.608 --> 19:54.645
I had to try.

19:54.735 --> 19:57.352
I had to.

19:57.446 --> 19:59.437
(board clatters)

20:02.451 --> 20:05.193
(indistinct chatter)

20:11.293 --> 20:13.705
(hammer pounding)

20:32.815 --> 20:36.683
We can get you outside the gates...
with a guard.

20:38.195 --> 20:40.937
So you can bury
your people.

20:42.616 --> 20:44.448
They're not mine.

20:44.535 --> 20:47.243
But I'm glad
you see them that way.

20:47.329 --> 20:49.570
As people.

20:57.882 --> 21:00.795
(vehicle door opens, closes)

21:00.885 --> 21:03.377
(engine starts)

21:05.097 --> 21:07.885
What is it?

21:07.975 --> 21:12.560
Just... you're a good leader.

21:14.815 --> 21:18.729
I knew it before,
but last night...

21:20.529 --> 21:22.315
You saved the gates.

21:22.406 --> 21:24.568
You saved the community.

21:24.658 --> 21:26.865
You saved lives.

21:28.746 --> 21:30.657
Because they sacrificed theirs.

21:33.584 --> 21:36.667
I only saved the prisoners
'cause Negan is still in play.

21:36.754 --> 21:39.712
Which means they could be.

21:39.799 --> 21:43.087
I sent Negan that body
in the box to make him mad.

21:45.763 --> 21:48.095
To lure him here.

21:49.892 --> 21:53.556
'Cause I wanted
my husband's... grave

21:53.646 --> 21:55.637
to be the last thing
he saw.

21:58.108 --> 22:00.941
Even if it came at a cost.

22:04.240 --> 22:07.153
I don't know if that
makes me a good leader.

22:09.328 --> 22:12.616
I do know
that the only regret I have

22:12.706 --> 22:14.993
is that Negan is not
in that pile of bodies.

22:20.130 --> 22:21.871
Carol: You had me worried.

22:21.966 --> 22:24.503
Well...

22:24.593 --> 22:27.255
if I'd known getting stabbed
would get your attention,

22:27.346 --> 22:30.008
I would've done it
a lot sooner.

22:30.099 --> 22:32.090
(chuckles)

22:33.811 --> 22:34.801
(glass thuds)

22:34.895 --> 22:37.136
I'm sorry for how I left.

22:37.231 --> 22:38.847
What I did to you.

22:38.941 --> 22:41.979
I don't need an apology.

22:42.069 --> 22:43.150
(sighs)

22:43.237 --> 22:45.729
You don't owe me anything.

22:47.700 --> 22:51.659
But, uh, I guess I have
been wondering why.

22:51.745 --> 22:53.486
Uh...

22:55.833 --> 22:59.201
Was any of it real?

22:59.295 --> 23:01.707
I didn't want it to be real.

23:03.549 --> 23:05.711
I was pretending.

23:05.801 --> 23:10.466
Well, don't go easy on me here.

23:10.556 --> 23:14.424
I was trying to live a life.

23:14.518 --> 23:17.636
Then we found out that we hadn't
gotten rid of the Saviors.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.641
And that there would be more
fighting and more dying.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.643
And I couldn't.

23:24.570 --> 23:30.282
And it was right about
the time that... it felt like--

23:32.328 --> 23:37.073
like-- like maybe
it wasn't...

23:37.166 --> 23:40.033
like maybe it wasn't
going to be pretending anymore.

23:42.463 --> 23:43.453
Maybe.

23:43.547 --> 23:46.209
Well...

23:46.300 --> 23:48.382
that just might be
one of the nicest things

23:48.469 --> 23:52.178
anybody's ever said to me.

23:57.561 --> 23:59.017
I'm sorry.

23:59.104 --> 24:01.141
(coughs)

24:01.231 --> 24:04.815
You gonna leave again?

24:04.902 --> 24:07.769
After it's over?

24:07.863 --> 24:09.774
I don't know.

24:13.077 --> 24:15.694
I think I might just accept that

24:15.788 --> 24:18.246
some of us are lucky enough
to just live,

24:18.332 --> 24:20.949
some of us are
lucky enough to just fight.

24:21.043 --> 24:24.161
Even after it ends?

24:24.254 --> 24:26.336
I don't think it ends.

24:26.423 --> 24:27.879
What we're doing...

24:30.052 --> 24:35.297
The end of the fight is--
is what we're fighting for.

24:37.768 --> 24:40.510
Winning just means
we get tomorrow.

24:46.026 --> 24:48.358
Carol:
Maybe one more night.

24:52.074 --> 24:53.985
(indistinct conversations)

24:58.789 --> 25:00.780
Maybe one more morning.

25:04.420 --> 25:06.457
After that...

25:06.547 --> 25:08.083
no guarantees.

25:15.389 --> 25:18.552
(suspenseful music plays)

25:18.642 --> 25:21.555
(clock ticking)

25:34.074 --> 25:36.782
Henry: I wouldn't have died
if I went out there.

25:36.869 --> 25:39.110
Carol:
You would have, Henry.

25:39.204 --> 25:41.070
Just trust me--
you would have.

25:50.883 --> 25:52.999
I could treat your wound.

25:54.720 --> 25:57.132
Wouldn't want it
to get infected.

26:09.902 --> 26:14.442
There's, um...
a prayer for the dead

26:14.531 --> 26:18.365
I first heard
when I was a little boy.

26:18.452 --> 26:23.242
It, uh...
ended with the phrase,

26:23.332 --> 26:29.544
"Do not send us astray
after 'them"'--

26:29.630 --> 26:32.497
- those who died...
- Don't.

26:52.069 --> 26:54.401
(indistinct conversations)

26:54.488 --> 26:57.071
(man coughs)

27:02.871 --> 27:04.657
How you feeling?

27:04.748 --> 27:05.954
(sighs)

27:07.251 --> 27:09.117
I'm okay.

27:09.211 --> 27:13.000
Siddiq and Dr. Dana,
they're-- they're good.

27:13.090 --> 27:14.751
Didn't even feel 'em
stitching me up.

27:14.842 --> 27:17.083
We're lucky to have 'em.

27:17.177 --> 27:19.088
We're lucky to have you.

27:19.179 --> 27:23.639
If Gregory was in charge, this--
this place wouldn't be here anymore.

27:23.725 --> 27:25.181
He was about himself.

27:25.269 --> 27:27.351
What he wanted.

27:28.814 --> 27:30.851
That's not you.

28:00.512 --> 28:03.300
(groans lightly)

28:12.983 --> 28:16.942
(breath rattles)

28:18.280 --> 28:21.068
(gasps)

28:21.158 --> 28:23.069
(growls softly)

28:39.468 --> 28:41.379
(insects chirping)

28:47.976 --> 28:52.265
(groans)

28:52.356 --> 28:55.644
(grunts)

28:55.734 --> 28:57.145
Hey.
What's going on?

29:00.530 --> 29:03.397
Mnh... it wasn't... they...

29:03.492 --> 29:05.233
Kurt:
Ah, you're burning up.

29:05.327 --> 29:07.785
I'm gonna go get the doctor.

29:10.999 --> 29:13.582
Just hold tight.

29:13.669 --> 29:15.285
- (growling)
- (grunting)

29:15.379 --> 29:16.915
(flesh tearing)

29:17.005 --> 29:18.916
(bodies thud)

29:41.363 --> 29:43.525
(flesh squishes)

29:47.869 --> 29:49.576
(growling)

29:49.663 --> 29:51.449
(groans)

29:54.042 --> 29:55.953
(walker growling)

30:01.466 --> 30:04.629
(baby crying)

30:04.720 --> 30:07.303
(walkers growling)

30:14.396 --> 30:16.307
(growling)

30:22.362 --> 30:24.273
(body thuds)

30:33.332 --> 30:34.572
(body thudding)

30:34.666 --> 30:36.907
(growling)

30:42.507 --> 30:46.091
(walkers growling)

30:52.601 --> 30:54.592
(insects chirping)

31:03.779 --> 31:05.770
(snoring)

31:09.534 --> 31:10.695
(gasps)

31:10.786 --> 31:12.902
Shh, shh, shh!

31:15.123 --> 31:16.579
You're Gregory, right?

31:16.666 --> 31:18.031
Gregory: Thank God.

31:18.126 --> 31:19.787
Yes.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.664
(fence rattles)

31:21.755 --> 31:23.120
Let me out.

31:23.215 --> 31:25.047
Do you know which one
killed my brother?

31:25.133 --> 31:26.965
L-I don't know
who your brother is.

31:27.052 --> 31:30.761
L-I don't know
any of these people.

31:30.847 --> 31:33.589
I'm not one of them.

31:41.149 --> 31:45.643
That's a very dangerous
weapon you got there, kiddo.

31:45.737 --> 31:48.195
Uh, I don't want
you to get hurt--

31:49.699 --> 31:52.282
I don't want
anyone to get hurt.

31:54.621 --> 31:59.457
Why don't you give it to me,
and we can talk, huh?

32:02.921 --> 32:08.416
I'm sorry
about your brother.

32:08.510 --> 32:10.501
Killing them
isn't gonna bring him back.

32:10.595 --> 32:11.756
No.

32:11.847 --> 32:14.430
But it'll make me feel better.

32:14.516 --> 32:16.553
It already did once.

32:18.145 --> 32:20.603
And why would you be in here
if you're not with them?

32:20.689 --> 32:23.101
I'm not dumb.

32:23.191 --> 32:24.681
One of you knows
who killed Ben,

32:24.776 --> 32:26.608
and if I have to,
I'm gonna start shooting people

32:26.695 --> 32:28.277
until someone tells me.

32:28.363 --> 32:30.445
Alden: Hey, kid.
I get it.

32:30.532 --> 32:34.821
My-- My big brother
died, too.

32:34.911 --> 32:36.822
Killing a buncha guys who mighta
had something to do with it

32:36.913 --> 32:40.247
sounds pretty damn good
in theory.

32:40.333 --> 32:44.918
But, uh, it's not gonna
make you feel any better.

32:45.922 --> 32:48.664
Not for long.

32:48.758 --> 32:50.795
I know.

32:50.886 --> 32:53.173
- What's up, Al?
- Nothing. Go back to sleep.

32:53.263 --> 32:56.176
(people screaming in distance)

32:59.811 --> 33:02.724
(walkers growling)

33:06.985 --> 33:09.147
(screaming continues)

33:09.237 --> 33:11.353
(grunting)

33:21.416 --> 33:23.578
(body thuds)

33:23.668 --> 33:25.579
(screaming)

33:33.845 --> 33:36.086
Ezekiel,
please watch our back.

33:36.181 --> 33:39.424
Rick,
I'm gonna need you to...

33:39.518 --> 33:41.259
Yeah.

33:45.607 --> 33:47.723
(man screams)

33:52.447 --> 33:53.778
(body thuds)

33:53.865 --> 33:55.447
Come on.

33:56.868 --> 33:58.575
(screaming continues)

34:02.249 --> 34:04.581
Music to my ears.

34:04.668 --> 34:07.706
Was it you?

34:11.675 --> 34:13.757
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about, kid.

34:19.056 --> 34:21.094
(chain clinking)

34:21.184 --> 34:23.391
(chain thuds)

34:23.478 --> 34:26.061
(gate creaks)

34:27.649 --> 34:30.232
I want the guy
who killed my brother.

34:30.318 --> 34:32.650
Somebody better
tell me now!

34:32.737 --> 34:35.980
Look, I know you're angry.
Okay? I know. I was, too.

34:36.074 --> 34:38.281
But words are a lot easier
t-to live with

34:38.368 --> 34:39.608
than actions, all right?

34:39.703 --> 34:42.491
Be a man and step forward

34:42.581 --> 34:46.791
so I don't have to kill
your friends.

34:46.876 --> 34:49.833
I'm gonna count to 10
and start shooting.

34:49.920 --> 34:55.087
1...2...3...

34:55.176 --> 34:57.918
(walker growling)

34:58.013 --> 35:01.426
(screams)

35:01.516 --> 35:05.009
(indistinct shouting)

35:08.273 --> 35:09.855
(grunts)

35:13.320 --> 35:16.278
Gate's open, boys!
Let's go!

35:16.364 --> 35:20.198
(indistinct shouting)

35:33.256 --> 35:37.170
(walkers growling)

35:41.806 --> 35:43.046
(flesh tears)

35:45.268 --> 35:47.430
(body thuds)

35:47.520 --> 35:49.306
The hell happened?

35:49.397 --> 35:50.558
I don't know.

35:50.649 --> 35:52.560
Maybe walkers got in.

35:52.651 --> 35:53.732
Maybe during the fight.

35:53.818 --> 35:56.059
These are our own people,
though.

36:01.368 --> 36:03.154
(growling)

36:03.244 --> 36:06.737
(screaming)

36:10.794 --> 36:13.536
Stay back!

36:16.966 --> 36:18.877
(growling fades)

36:22.889 --> 36:25.722
(flesh tears)

36:25.809 --> 36:27.550
(body thuds)

36:27.644 --> 36:31.353
(breathing heavily)

36:35.610 --> 36:37.226
You all right?

36:37.320 --> 36:39.778
Yeah, just...

36:39.864 --> 36:41.946
He wasn't bit.

36:42.033 --> 36:43.740
But he turned.

36:48.164 --> 36:51.373
Negan's bat.

36:51.459 --> 36:55.794
When I was out there with him,
it was covered in walker blood.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.416
I just thought
he'd crossed some.

36:57.507 --> 37:01.922
But maybe...

37:02.011 --> 37:04.799
They have us working
for them again.

37:04.889 --> 37:05.970
(breathing heavily)

37:06.057 --> 37:08.515
Killin' our own.

37:08.601 --> 37:11.263
Bruce: It's the fever.

37:11.354 --> 37:14.062
That's what it is.

37:15.859 --> 37:18.271
It makes sense now.

37:26.286 --> 37:29.244
(voice breaking)
One of you...

37:29.330 --> 37:30.946
you're gonna have to do it.

37:31.040 --> 37:33.452
(breathing heavily)

37:33.543 --> 37:35.875
I can't.

37:35.962 --> 37:37.327
You gotta do it for me.

37:37.422 --> 37:40.335
Please.

37:42.010 --> 37:44.172
Please.

37:44.262 --> 37:47.220
(sniffling)

38:00.028 --> 38:01.359
(door creaks)

38:01.446 --> 38:03.653
H9)!-

38:03.740 --> 38:05.697
Good out there?

38:05.784 --> 38:07.650
House is clear.

38:07.744 --> 38:10.031
How'd this happen?

38:10.121 --> 38:12.203
(door closes)

38:15.794 --> 38:19.537
(sighs)

38:19.631 --> 38:24.671
Um... the Saviors did something
to their weapons.

38:24.761 --> 38:28.720
Everyone they cut up...
or got shot...

38:28.807 --> 38:31.219
they all got sick.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.471
Some of 'em turned.

38:33.561 --> 38:36.144
What?

38:36.231 --> 38:37.471
No.

38:43.404 --> 38:45.065
Okay-

38:46.741 --> 38:49.950
When we were out there,

38:50.036 --> 38:54.030
and you said
you were done waiting,

38:54.123 --> 38:55.955
I coulda killed him.

38:56.042 --> 38:57.658
I shoulda.

38:57.752 --> 39:01.245
No. He wanted
to be here with us.

39:03.216 --> 39:04.957
And no matter what he did
or how hard he tried,

39:05.051 --> 39:06.462
I wanted him dead.

39:09.597 --> 39:12.259
I just couldn't
let it be anything else.

39:15.979 --> 39:20.394
Karma's a bitch, right?

39:23.820 --> 39:26.653
(walkers growling)

39:35.623 --> 39:36.738
Hands up, now!

39:36.833 --> 39:38.665
Hey, we're trying to help!

39:38.751 --> 39:41.709
A-A-A kid came and opened up the pen.
We had people turn.

39:41.796 --> 39:43.753
A bunch of 'em left, but a bunch of 'em
are trying to close that gate.

39:43.840 --> 39:45.376
Maggie, look.

39:45.466 --> 39:48.254
(walkers growling)

39:48.344 --> 39:49.630
Dianne.

39:49.721 --> 39:52.179
We're on it.
Come on.

39:57.478 --> 39:59.594
What are you doing out here?

39:59.689 --> 40:02.272
I went to check on the prisoners,
but the pen was empty.

40:05.653 --> 40:07.269
Where are the others?

40:07.363 --> 40:08.398
Alden: They didn't say
where they were goin'.

40:08.489 --> 40:10.105
They just ran.

40:10.199 --> 40:11.655
And you didn't?

40:11.743 --> 40:15.031
You saw what we mean
to Negan and Simon.

40:15.121 --> 40:16.577
Which might
be a dumb thing to say--

40:16.664 --> 40:18.371
it doesn't make us worth much
to your people, either,

40:18.458 --> 40:22.122
but... those of us
that stayed, stayed.

40:22.211 --> 40:25.329
We had plenty of chances to run.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.895
Henry!

40:44.192 --> 40:46.775
Henry, if you're down here,
come on out!

40:46.861 --> 40:48.852
Yo.
We've checked everywhere.

40:48.947 --> 40:50.733
The little man's gone.

40:50.823 --> 40:54.111
Hey. Some of the Saviors
said Henry broke into the pen,

40:54.202 --> 40:56.443
just before
the others escaped.

40:56.537 --> 40:58.778
He was down there,
and then he wasn't.

41:01.334 --> 41:04.201
I told him...
I told him what would happen.

41:12.053 --> 41:14.135
Gavin:
You know what it is.

41:14.222 --> 41:17.465
You know what it is.

41:17.558 --> 41:19.174
Mnh.

41:20.436 --> 41:22.677
You know what it is.

41:22.772 --> 41:24.558
You know what it is!

41:24.649 --> 41:25.810
(grunts)

41:25.900 --> 41:27.186
You know what it is.

41:27.276 --> 41:30.689
You know what it is!
(echoing) You know!

41:30.780 --> 41:32.691
(shovels scraping)

41:44.252 --> 41:45.708
What is it?

41:53.302 --> 41:55.213
The cost.

42:16.701 --> 42:18.658
(theme music playing)
