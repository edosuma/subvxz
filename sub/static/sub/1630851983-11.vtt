00:21.688 --> 00:24.399
I can't believe
it's already time to go home.

00:26.276 --> 00:27.736
Maybe next time.

00:31.657 --> 00:34.701
We barely have any time for the gift shop.

00:34.785 --> 00:38.205
<i>Don't worry. I have something even better.</i>

00:40.791 --> 00:42.459
What's this?

00:42.543 --> 00:46.421
<i>In honor of your contribution
to NASA's search for life,</i>

00:46.505 --> 00:48.382
<i>I'd like to present you withâ€¦</i>

00:48.966 --> 00:50.425
<i>mission medals.</i>

00:51.468 --> 00:53.011
<i>One for you. Here you go.</i>

00:53.095 --> 00:54.096
Neat.

00:54.179 --> 00:55.305
<i>There you go.</i>

00:55.389 --> 00:56.765
<i>Here you go.</i>

00:56.849 --> 00:57.850
<i>There you go.</i>

00:57.933 --> 00:59.351
<i>Oops.</i>

01:01.854 --> 01:04.565
Wait. I think this one is Franklin's.

01:04.647 --> 01:06.483
I don't want one, Charlie Brown.

01:07.943 --> 01:10.195
I wish I could accept a mission medal.

01:10.279 --> 01:13.282
But medals are meant to reward
a job well done,

01:13.365 --> 01:15.576
and our job isn't done.

01:15.659 --> 01:18.078
Hey. Don't be so hard on yourself.

01:18.161 --> 01:21.123
We worked together
and made lots of great discoveries.

01:21.206 --> 01:23.166
Like an interstellar asteroid.

01:23.250 --> 01:26.837
And that was great.
But we didn't make "the" discovery.

01:26.920 --> 01:30.007
I'm not going anywhere until we find life.

01:33.635 --> 01:37.639
<i>Franklin, I'm sure I'll be seeing you
again for a future mission,</i>

01:37.723 --> 01:40.851
<i>but for now, it is time to go home.</i>

01:40.934 --> 01:43.103
- Really?
- <i>Really.</i>

01:43.896 --> 01:47.024
I thought if we could just find
the right piece of the puzzle,

01:47.107 --> 01:48.901
we'd figure out the answer.

01:48.984 --> 01:52.988
But after all that exploring,
all we have are more questions.

02:02.164 --> 02:03.415
What do we do now?

02:06.043 --> 02:07.044
<i>Don't look at me.</i>

02:07.127 --> 02:11.131
<i>The complexities of human emotions are
outside my programming parameters.</i>

02:23.143 --> 02:24.978
- I can do that.
- It just might work.

02:25.062 --> 02:26.605
- Great idea, boy.
- Count me in.

02:41.578 --> 02:45.290
Sorry, Snoopy,
but I just wanna be alone for a bit.

02:49.962 --> 02:53.090
That's a nice wagon.
But I'm not sure what it has to do--

03:10.732 --> 03:11.984
What's going on in--

03:14.194 --> 03:17.865
Behold! The once inscrutable cosmos.

03:17.948 --> 03:20.909
Revealing its secrets
with each new discovery.

03:22.411 --> 03:23.620
This is pretty neat.

03:25.539 --> 03:26.748
Is that Mars?

03:28.750 --> 03:31.003
Hey, look. It's the ice we found.

03:32.337 --> 03:33.422
You got it.

03:33.505 --> 03:37.926
The same ice that makes scientists think
Mars may have once had lots of water.

03:40.304 --> 03:42.681
Which makes us wonder if one day

03:42.764 --> 03:45.684
we'll find evidence
that life existed long ago.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.519
- Like a fossil.
- Yeah.

03:47.603 --> 03:51.565
Or maybe even evidence of microorganisms
that could be there right now.

03:54.401 --> 03:55.694
Good catch, sir.

03:57.654 --> 03:58.655
Ahoy!

03:58.739 --> 04:02.451
I am the tides of Europa
dancing to Jupiter's rhythm
I am the tides of Europa
dancing to Jupiter's rhythm

04:02.534 --> 04:05.204
beneath a mysterious cap of ice.

04:05.287 --> 04:08.457
Who knows what kind of life
might be flourishing in there.

04:19.091 --> 04:21.261
Well, it sounds like science fiction,

04:21.345 --> 04:24.848
but with all that water and plenty of time
for life to have developed,

04:24.932 --> 04:26.934
that's actually a possibility.

04:34.316 --> 04:37.236
Thick atmosphere. Must be Venus.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.698
Really? A cloud?

04:41.782 --> 04:45.577
I was informed I would be playing
a leading role in this production!

04:45.661 --> 04:48.121
Just say the line. Please.

04:48.205 --> 04:51.542
Quoting Charlie Brown,
"Has it really come to this?"

04:53.168 --> 04:55.838
Don't forget about
life as we don't know it.

04:55.921 --> 04:59.967
Yeah. Poisonous air, underground lava.

05:00.050 --> 05:02.010
Venus doesn't seem too hospitable

05:02.094 --> 05:07.057
until you remember that life outside Earth
may take a completely different form

05:07.140 --> 05:08.433
than what we expect.

05:08.517 --> 05:09.601
Uh-huh.

05:09.685 --> 05:12.813
There might even be life
in Venus's extreme environments.

05:12.896 --> 05:15.816
And if life could be there,
where else might it be?

05:17.693 --> 05:19.486
Exoplanet, you're up.

05:21.989 --> 05:26.159
We can't forget that there are planets
positioned in just the right place

05:26.243 --> 05:28.620
to have the perfect conditions for life.

05:28.704 --> 05:30.163
I'll use the other door.

05:32.291 --> 05:35.377
They're just too far away
to reach right now.

05:35.460 --> 05:39.089
Check it out.
A traveler from a faraway solar system.

05:39.173 --> 05:43.093
Our big discovery.
An interstellar asteroid.

05:43.177 --> 05:46.221
Could it be carrying information
from distant planets?

05:46.305 --> 05:48.056
Or life itself?

05:48.140 --> 05:49.266
Incredible.

05:49.850 --> 05:53.687
Hey. Maybe questions actually
can be as good as answers.

05:53.770 --> 05:58.150
Every time we hit a snag,
it just inspired us to try something else,

05:58.233 --> 06:00.277
or think in a different way!
or think in a different way!

06:08.160 --> 06:10.120
Look at all these stars.

06:10.204 --> 06:12.331
You know, given that scientists think

06:12.414 --> 06:16.084
there are over 40 billion planets
just in our galaxy alone

06:16.168 --> 06:19.087
and over 100 billion galaxies
in the universe,

06:19.171 --> 06:22.758
it's almost harder to believe
that there isn't life out there somewhere.

06:22.841 --> 06:25.677
It's just a matter of
not giving up the search.

06:30.015 --> 06:31.600
Thanks, everyone.

06:31.683 --> 06:33.060
I get it now.

06:33.143 --> 06:37.105
Whether or not there's any life
outside of Earth is a big question.

06:37.189 --> 06:40.150
We can't expect to come up with
an answer all at once.

06:40.234 --> 06:42.361
<i>What we can do is keep exploring</i>

06:42.444 --> 06:46.114
<i>and use what we learn
to figure out which new questions to ask.</i>

06:46.198 --> 06:48.158
<i>That's the whole point of science.</i>

06:48.742 --> 06:51.078
Don't forget your mission medal, Franklin.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.837
Thanks, everyone.

07:00.629 --> 07:01.755
<i>Look at you.</i>

07:02.756 --> 07:05.133
Oh, no! I'm late for the gift shop!

07:13.433 --> 07:15.227
I get it now, Snoopy.

07:16.270 --> 07:19.439
Life is amazing, and it's worth the wait.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.120
Come on.

07:33.203 --> 07:35.163
Turn the planet, you blockhead.
