00:11.130 --> 00:12.080
Hey...

00:12.490 --> 00:14.880
They say it's five centimeters per second.

00:14.915 --> 00:16.420
Huh? What is?

00:16.670 --> 00:21.030
The speed at which cherry blossoms fall.
It's five centimeters per second.

00:22.770 --> 00:25.330
You sure know a lot of stuff like that, Akari.

00:27.610 --> 00:31.820
Say... don't you think it kinda looks like snow?

00:31.855 --> 00:33.280
I guess...

00:36.240 --> 00:38.490
Hey! Wait up!

00:45.270 --> 00:46.090
Akari!

00:46.170 --> 00:46.970
Takaki-kun!

00:49.750 --> 00:53.720
It'd be great if we could watch the cherry
blossoms fall again together next year.

01:07.220 --> 01:08.640
"To Thono Takaki-sama. "

01:09.110 --> 01:11.270
"It's been a really long time. "

01:16.290 --> 01:21.860
"Summer's pretty hot around here,
but compared to Tokyo, it's so much milder. "

01:22.360 --> 01:27.910
"But when I think about it,
I liked Tokyo's hot, humid summers, too. "

01:28.130 --> 01:30.540
"The melting-hot asphalt,"

01:30.690 --> 01:32.930
"the distant skyscrapers, shimmering in the heat,"

01:32.960 --> 01:36.460
"and the freezing air-conditioning
in department stores and on subways. "

01:36.820 --> 01:41.350
"The last time we were together was at
our elementary school graduation. "

01:41.540 --> 01:43.350
"It's already been half a year since. "

01:44.290 --> 01:46.160
"So, Takaki-kun... "

01:46.870 --> 01:49.890
"... do you still remember me?."

01:53.870 --> 01:56.210
"Dear Takaki-kun... "

01:56.690 --> 01:57.910
"Thanks for replying. "

01:57.980 --> 01:59.500
"It made me so happy. "

02:00.440 --> 02:04.710
"It's already well into autumn and the
leaves are turning beautiful colors. "

02:05.160 --> 02:09.380
"I had to pull out a sweater the day before
yesterday for the first time this year. "

02:10.169 --> 02:10.970
Tohno-kun.

02:11.039 --> 02:12.010
Senpai.

02:12.490 --> 02:14.010
What's that? A love letter?

02:14.330 --> 02:15.240
That's not it.

02:15.280 --> 02:17.090
Sorry for having asked you to do all that.

02:17.125 --> 02:18.425
No problem, I finished quickly.

02:18.460 --> 02:21.170
Thanks. So, is it true
that you'll be transferring schools?

02:21.205 --> 02:23.360
Ah, yes, at the end of the year.

02:23.470 --> 02:24.290
Where to?

02:24.360 --> 02:26.725
Kagoshima. Because of my parents.

02:26.760 --> 02:28.725
I see... it'll be lonely around here without you.

02:28.760 --> 02:34.310
"I'm actually writing this letter on the train because
practice has been starting really early lately. "

02:34.430 --> 02:36.590
"I had my hair cut the other day. "

02:36.810 --> 02:39.000
"It's so short you can even see my ears... "

02:39.500 --> 02:43.360
"... so you probably wouldn't even recognize me
if you saw me. "

02:43.550 --> 02:44.160
I'm back.

02:44.290 --> 02:45.170
Welcome home.

02:54.230 --> 02:58.990
"I bet you're changing little
by little too, Takaki-kun. "

03:13.530 --> 03:14.700
"Dear Takaki-kun... "

03:14.940 --> 03:18.390
"Have you been doing well during these cold days?"

03:23.210 --> 03:25.820
"It's already snowed a number of times here. "

03:25.990 --> 03:30.260
"Every time it does, I wrap myself
in layers of clothes when I go to school. "

03:30.940 --> 03:33.870
"It hasn't snowed in Tokyo yet, right?."

03:33.905 --> 03:36.120
"Even though I moved away... "

03:36.230 --> 03:39.510
"... I still look at Tokyo's
weather forecast out of habit. "

03:43.800 --> 03:45.630
Wish it would rain one of these days...

03:45.665 --> 03:47.630
It wouldn't be any better indoors.

03:47.860 --> 03:51.090
Say... have you guys ever been to Tochigi?

03:51.125 --> 03:52.220
Huh? Where?

03:52.400 --> 03:53.010
Tochigi.

03:53.230 --> 03:53.870
Nope.

03:54.510 --> 03:55.730
I wonder how you get there...

03:56.150 --> 03:56.890
No clue.

03:57.030 --> 03:58.810
A bullet train or something?

03:59.230 --> 04:00.200
It's a long way...

04:02.690 --> 04:03.530
Freshmen!

04:03.540 --> 04:04.150
Yes?!

04:05.220 --> 04:08.430
Onto the final three laps! Fight! Fight!

04:08.440 --> 04:13.320
"I was surprised to hear that you were
the one transferring schools this time. "

04:13.800 --> 04:17.339
"We both got used to transferring schools
when we were little.. "

04:17.370 --> 04:22.120
"But still... Kagoshima.
That's kind of far away, isn't it?"

04:23.730 --> 04:28.750
"It's no longer a distance where I can just
jump on a train and see you whenever I want... "

04:28.785 --> 04:33.130
"So... I guess... that makes me feel a little lonely. "

04:34.340 --> 04:38.010
"Please be well, Takaki-kun. "

04:52.720 --> 04:54.920
"Dear Takaki-kun... "

04:56.150 --> 04:59.690
"I'm so happy we'll see each other on March 4th. "

04:59.930 --> 05:02.540
"It'll be just about a year
since we last met, won't it?"

05:02.680 --> 05:05.000
"For some reason, I feel kind of nervous. "

05:12.320 --> 05:17.850
"There's a really large cherry tree close to
my house, so I bet that in the spring... "

05:18.130 --> 05:21.580
"... the petals will fall
at five centimeters per second. "

05:23.300 --> 05:28.600
"I'm really hoping the spring
will come with you that day, Takaki-kun. "

05:46.600 --> 05:48.170
Wanna stop somewhere on the way home?

05:48.205 --> 05:49.750
Well... it's raining out.

05:49.780 --> 05:52.040
The forecast said it's supposed
to turn to snow by tonight.

05:52.180 --> 05:54.100
Really? I thought it felt cold.

05:54.220 --> 05:56.010
And we're already in March...

05:56.310 --> 05:59.590
Yeah, it feels like I'm gonna catch a cold.

05:59.625 --> 06:00.800
We can get off at Shimokita.

06:01.170 --> 06:02.010
Yeah.

06:02.600 --> 06:05.110
Tohno, let's get to practice.

06:05.145 --> 06:05.880
Right...

06:07.990 --> 06:10.690
About that... I don't think I can make it today.

06:10.725 --> 06:11.892
Getting ready to move?

06:11.927 --> 06:13.060
Something like that.

06:13.095 --> 06:13.910
Sorry.

06:14.310 --> 06:18.540
"I'm glad you're coming all the way out
to the station closest to me... "

06:18.610 --> 06:21.520
"... but it's a long trip, so please be careful. "

06:22.440 --> 06:26.160
"I'll be waiting for you in the station's
waiting room at 7:00 that night. "

06:45.670 --> 06:50.810
<i>On the day Akari and I were to meet,
the rain turned to snow in the afternoon.</i>

06:54.060 --> 06:55.430
Hey, Takaki-kun.

06:55.620 --> 06:57.480
It's that cat, Chobi.

06:57.680 --> 06:59.860
He's always lying here.

06:59.910 --> 07:01.900
But it looks like he's all by himself today.

07:02.070 --> 07:05.610
What happened to your friend Mimi?
It must be lonely all by yourself, huh?

07:16.910 --> 07:17.880
How's that book so far?

07:17.990 --> 07:19.170
I really like it.

07:19.220 --> 07:21.590
Last night I read four billion years' worth of evolution.

07:21.670 --> 07:22.560
Where are you at now?

07:22.580 --> 07:24.550
Just about when the Anomalocaris start showing up.

07:24.620 --> 07:25.550
The Cambrian era!

07:27.060 --> 07:30.600
I really like the Hallucigenia. They look like this!

07:30.830 --> 07:32.170
Yeah, something like that...

07:32.330 --> 07:33.810
Which one do you like, Takaki-kun?

07:33.880 --> 07:35.525
The Opabinia, maybe?

07:35.560 --> 07:37.615
The five-eyed one, right?

07:37.650 --> 07:41.800
<i>I think Akari and I were a lot alike somehow.</i>

07:43.435 --> 07:43.450
<i>Exactly one year after I transferred to Tokyo...</i>

07:43.470 --> 07:46.450
A new friend just transferred to our school.
This is Tohno Takaki-kun.

07:46.480 --> 07:46.725
<i>...Akari transferred into my class.</i>

07:46.760 --> 07:49.920
Starting today, Shinohara Akari-san
will be joining our class.

07:50.610 --> 07:53.665
<i>Because our bodies were still small,
frail, and prone to illness...</i>

07:53.700 --> 07:56.580
<i>...the two of us preferred the library
over playing on the sportsfield.</i>

07:56.650 --> 07:58.950
<i>Naturally, we became friends...</i>

07:59.290 --> 08:03.840
<i>...and because of that, there were times when
our classmates would tease us. But...</i>

08:01.295 --> 08:01.295
I feel kinda bad for her.

08:01.330 --> 08:03.410
Those two are always together.

08:05.240 --> 08:05.605
Ooh! There he is!

08:05.640 --> 08:10.720
<i>As long as we were both together,
strangely, things like that didn't scare us.</i>

08:10.755 --> 08:12.200
Aw, what a nice guy!

08:12.250 --> 08:13.290
Wow!

08:16.040 --> 08:18.770
<i>And yet, for some reason, I thought we'd
end up going to the same middle school...</i>

08:18.805 --> 08:20.900
<i>...and stay together, just as we were...</i>

08:21.210 --> 08:24.190
<i>...from that point on.</i>

08:28.240 --> 08:32.020
Shinjuku, Shinjuku, last stop. For passengers which...

08:34.750 --> 08:38.490
...JR Line, Heiou Line, subway...

08:41.850 --> 08:45.095
<i>It was the first time I'd gone
to Shinjuku Station alone...</i>

08:45.130 --> 08:49.240
<i>...and all the lines I would soon be riding
would also be firsts for me.</i>

08:55.940 --> 08:57.930
<i>My heart was pounding.</i>

09:01.150 --> 09:04.390
<i>I was going to see Akari again.</i>

09:10.720 --> 09:12.700
How did it go with that guy?

09:12.740 --> 09:13.490
Who?

09:13.660 --> 09:15.125
You know, that Nisshou boy.

09:15.160 --> 09:16.105
Are you kidding? His tastes were a little gross...

09:16.140 --> 09:20.110
We will be arriving at Musashi-Urawa shortly.
Again, this is Musashi-Urawa.

09:20.230 --> 09:23.020
At our next stop, Musashi-Urawa,
in order to connect with the express train...

09:23.050 --> 09:27.330
In order to connect with the express train,
this train will be stopping for 4 minutes.

09:27.750 --> 09:31.270
Those passengers who wish to quickly reach Yonohonmachi
and Oomiya please board...

09:53.530 --> 09:56.320
Um... this is Shinohara.

09:56.690 --> 09:59.570
Umm, is Takaki-kun there?

10:00.410 --> 10:01.540
It's Akari-chan.

10:03.070 --> 10:05.080
Huh? You're transferring schools?

10:06.300 --> 10:10.120
What about Nishi Middle School?
You went through all that trouble to get accepted.

10:10.900 --> 10:14.620
They said they'd handle the paperwork of transferring
me to the public school in Tochigi...

10:14.630 --> 10:15.450
I'm sorry...

10:16.620 --> 10:19.510
No... there's no reason to apologize.

10:19.640 --> 10:23.140
I told them I still wanted to go
from my aunt's house in Katsushika, but...

10:23.410 --> 10:27.030
...they said I couldn't until I was older.

10:28.570 --> 10:30.660
I understand... you don't have to say anything else.

10:31.340 --> 10:32.440
That's enough.

10:35.790 --> 10:36.990
I'm sorry...

10:38.570 --> 10:41.700
<i>Through the receiver painfully pressed
against my ear...</i>

10:42.090 --> 10:45.410
<i>...Akari's own pain was palpable.</i>

10:45.600 --> 10:48.340
<i>But... there was nothing I could do.</i>

10:55.010 --> 10:56.220
That was pretty good, huh?

10:56.255 --> 10:57.175
Yeah. See you later!

10:57.210 --> 11:01.510
<i>The terminal I transferred at
was crowded with people heading home...</i>

11:01.750 --> 11:05.010
<i>...and everyone's shoes were soaked from the snow.</i>

11:05.250 --> 11:10.180
<i>The frigid air was saturated with the classic smell
of a snowy city day.</i>

11:10.550 --> 11:12.340
All passengers, your attention please.

11:12.710 --> 11:16.160
Due to the snowy weather conditions, the Utsunomiya Line
outbound trains traveling to Oomiya and Utsunomiya...

11:16.195 --> 11:19.350
...will be experiencing an 8 minute delay in arrival.

11:19.390 --> 11:22.385
We apologize for any inconvenience in your busy day.

11:22.420 --> 11:28.410
Until that moment, I hadn't even considered
the possibility of one of my trains being late.

11:28.740 --> 11:31.960
<i>My creeping anxiety suddenly became much greater.</i>

11:36.270 --> 11:41.040
This train is currently running 10 minutes late
due to the snowy weather conditions.

11:41.190 --> 11:44.550
We apologize for any inconvenience in your busy day.

11:47.640 --> 11:50.220
<i>After we had passed a little beyond Oomiya Station...</i>

11:50.460 --> 11:53.890
<i>...almost all the passing buildings
suddenly vanished from view.</i>

12:05.970 --> 12:08.580
Next stop is Kuki. Kuki.

12:10.240 --> 12:13.540
We apologize for our terribly late arrival.

12:14.570 --> 12:18.390
Those passengers transferring to the Tobu Isesaki Line,
please make your way around to Exit #5.

12:20.830 --> 12:25.910
Due to the next train's delay, this train will be stopping
at this station for the next 10 minutes.

12:26.670 --> 12:32.200
We apologize for any inconvenience in your busy day,
and appreciate your understanding.

12:34.550 --> 12:35.480
Sorry about that.

12:35.620 --> 12:40.650
Due to the next train's delay, this train will be stopping
at this station for the next 10 minutes.

12:41.090 --> 12:44.840
We apologize for any inconvenience in your busy day, and...

13:06.920 --> 13:08.560
This is Nogi. Nogi.

13:09.540 --> 13:12.185
To all passengers, we express our deepest apologies.

13:12.220 --> 13:16.610
Due to the continuing delay of the following train, this train will
be stopping at this station for an extended period of time.

13:16.645 --> 13:22.130
We apologize for any inconvenience in your busy day,
and appreciate your understanding.

13:22.165 --> 13:22.165
<i>The stations seemed unbelievably far apart...</i>

13:22.390 --> 13:27.320
<i>...and the train would stop for an unbelievably
long amount of time at each station.</i>

13:27.610 --> 13:31.835
Kurihashi > Koga > Nogi > Mamada > Oyama

13:31.870 --> 13:37.040
Omoigawa > Tochigi > Ohirashita > Iwafune > Sano

13:48.210 --> 13:52.580
<i>The wilderness on the other side of the
window seemed like nothing I'd ever experienced before.</i>

13:52.640 --> 13:54.810
<i>The slowly ticking time...</i>

13:54.890 --> 13:56.720
<i>...and my pangs of hunger...</i>

13:57.070 --> 13:59.770
<i>...continued to dampen my spirits.</i>

14:02.120 --> 14:04.130
<i>The time we had planned to meet had passed...</i>

14:04.200 --> 14:08.250
<i>...so I had the feeling that Akari was beginning to worry.</i>

14:13.010 --> 14:14.240
<i>On that day...</i>

14:14.800 --> 14:16.510
<i>...the day she called...</i>

14:16.760 --> 14:24.330
<i>...Akari must've been so much more jittery and upset than me,
yet I couldn't find the words to console her.</i>

14:24.365 --> 14:26.460
<i>I felt so ashamed of myself.</i>

14:27.370 --> 14:37.670
<i>As we look back, we thank our teachers
for all they've done.</i>

14:37.705 --> 14:37.880
Then I guess after today... this is goodbye.

14:38.780 --> 14:40.440
Any summer vacation plans?

14:40.460 --> 14:44.380
<i>I received the first letter from Akari
half a year later...</i>

14:44.780 --> 14:47.060
<i>...during the summer of my first year of middle school.</i>

14:47.420 --> 14:51.290
<i>I remember every last word of it.</i>

14:51.610 --> 14:53.940
<i>Over the two weeks before the day we were to meet...</i>

14:54.690 --> 14:57.790
<i>...I spent my time writing a letter I would give her.</i>

14:58.130 --> 15:00.470
<i>It was filled with all the things I had to tell her.</i>

15:00.510 --> 15:01.770
<i>All the things I wanted her to hear.</i>

15:02.040 --> 15:04.950
<i>There were so many.</i>

15:05.020 --> 15:06.860
We apologize terribly for the wait.

15:06.900 --> 15:09.540
This train will shortly begin
its departure towards Utsunomiya.

15:22.470 --> 15:24.340
This is Oyama. Oyama.

15:24.360 --> 15:27.300
For those passengers changing over to the
Tohoku Bullet Train, please transfer here.

15:28.570 --> 15:32.890
Those passengers transferring to the down-train,
the Tohoku Bullet Train towards Morioka, please transfer to Line 1.

15:33.180 --> 15:37.500
Those passengers transferring to the up-train
towards Tokyo, please transfer to Line 5.

15:37.610 --> 15:40.570
Those passengers transferring to the Mito Line-

15:40.605 --> 15:40.605
All passengers, your attention please.

15:40.920 --> 15:46.340
Due to snowy weather conditions, the
Ryomo Line is currently experiencing a serious delay.

15:46.850 --> 15:50.110
We apologize for the terrible inconvenience.

15:50.490 --> 15:54.490
We ask that you please be patient and wait
a little longer until the train arrives.

15:54.680 --> 15:57.750
The next up-train headed for-

15:57.715 --> 15:57.715
<i>Either way...</i>

15:57.750 --> 16:01.340
<i>...I had no choice but to keep going towards
the station where Akari was waiting.</i>

16:55.460 --> 17:00.600
This is the up-train, Line 8, towards Takasaki,
passing Ashikaga and Maebashi on the way.

17:00.710 --> 17:02.800
Please stand behind the white line-

17:34.510 --> 17:36.730
All passengers, your attention please.

17:36.960 --> 17:41.740
Due to the disrupted schedule from the heavy snowfall
this train will be making a temporary stop.

17:41.910 --> 17:44.200
We apologize terribly for this inconvenience in your busy day...

17:44.220 --> 17:46.780
...but presently, we are unable to resume normal service.

17:47.630 --> 17:48.790
I repeat...

18:03.140 --> 18:03.960
"Dear Takaki-kun... "

18:03.995 --> 18:05.530
"How are you?"

18:06.520 --> 18:10.740
"I'm actually writing this letter on the train because
practice has been starting really early lately. "

18:10.820 --> 18:13.180
<i>Every time I tried to picture Akari from her letters...</i>

18:13.215 --> 18:16.280
<i>...she was always alone for some reason.</i>

18:19.770 --> 18:26.310
<i>In the end, the train remained stopped
in the barren wilderness for two hours.</i>

18:26.820 --> 18:29.800
<i>Each minute felt like an eternity.</i>

18:29.835 --> 18:32.780
<i>With clear malice towards me...</i>

18:33.190 --> 18:36.300
<i>...time continued to drift slowly forwards around me.</i>

18:37.110 --> 18:39.500
<i>I clenched my teeth tightly together...</i>

18:39.900 --> 18:44.320
<i>...and could do nothing but endure the pain
and hold back my tears.</i>

18:46.180 --> 18:47.310
<i>Akari...</i>

18:48.620 --> 18:49.500
<i>Please tell me...</i>

18:49.870 --> 18:51.670
<i>...you've already...</i>

18:54.400 --> 18:56.800
<i>...returned home.</i>

19:11.110 --> 19:16.070
Line 3 towards Takasaki, passing Ashikaga
and Maebashi on the way has just arrived.

19:18.230 --> 19:21.590
Due to the snowy weather conditions, this train
will be making a temporary stop.

19:58.580 --> 19:59.880
Akari...

20:29.650 --> 20:31.020
It tastes good.

20:31.740 --> 20:32.450
Really?

20:32.610 --> 20:34.270
It's just hot roasted tea.

20:34.310 --> 20:35.520
Roasted tea?

20:36.060 --> 20:37.145
This is my first time having it...

20:37.180 --> 20:39.660
You're kidding. I'm sure you've had it before.

20:39.790 --> 20:40.630
You think?

20:40.650 --> 20:41.730
You must have.

20:42.630 --> 20:48.160
And... since I made this, I can't really guarantee
how good it'll taste, but...

20:48.410 --> 20:50.290
If you'd like, please have some.

20:50.410 --> 20:51.840
Thanks!

20:52.860 --> 20:54.880
I was really hungry.

20:58.790 --> 20:59.640
How is it?

21:04.050 --> 21:07.090
It's the most delicious rice ball I've ever had.

21:07.320 --> 21:08.660
You're exaggerating!

21:08.690 --> 21:09.430
It really is!

21:09.660 --> 21:11.550
It's probably just because you're hungry.

21:11.590 --> 21:12.480
You think so?

21:12.600 --> 21:13.550
It must be.

21:13.730 --> 21:15.440
I think I'll have a bite, too.

21:20.260 --> 21:22.640
So... you're moving soon, right?

21:22.750 --> 21:24.320
Yeah. Next week.

21:24.330 --> 21:25.850
Kagoshima, huh?

21:25.960 --> 21:26.890
It's pretty far away.

21:26.925 --> 21:27.550
Yeah...

21:28.760 --> 21:31.010
Though this trip to Tochigi was pretty far, too.

21:31.050 --> 21:32.780
You can't even go home today now, after all.

21:36.190 --> 21:39.310
We'll be closing soon.
There aren't any more trains coming or going.

21:39.560 --> 21:40.380
Yes, sir.

21:40.580 --> 21:42.640
Be careful on your way home in this snow.

21:42.650 --> 21:43.440
Yes, sir.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.340
Can you see the tree way out there?

22:09.720 --> 22:11.040
Is that the tree from your letters?

22:11.080 --> 22:13.160
Yeah. It's a cherry tree.

22:20.470 --> 22:21.360
So...

22:22.490 --> 22:25.060
...don't you think it looks a little like snow?

22:32.840 --> 22:33.910
It sure does.

22:44.230 --> 22:45.860
<i>In that moment...</i>

22:46.680 --> 22:52.140
<i>...I felt like I knew where eternity,
our hearts and ours souls all lay.</i>

22:52.750 --> 22:56.980
<i>I felt as though we had shared
all the experiences of my 13 years.</i>

22:57.120 --> 22:59.790
<i>And then... in the next moment...</i>

23:00.390 --> 23:02.960
<i>...I was suddenly filled
with an insufferable sadness.</i>

23:04.960 --> 23:08.230
<i>Akari's warmth... and her soul...</i>

23:08.750 --> 23:12.590
<i>How could I take them in,
and where could I bring them?</i>

23:12.740 --> 23:15.260
<i>I felt that sad because I didn't have those answers.</i>

23:18.120 --> 23:23.600
<i>I clearly knew that from that point on,
we wouldn't be together forever.</i>

23:24.530 --> 23:27.420
<i>The overwhelming weight of our lives to come...</i>

23:28.020 --> 23:32.310
<i>...and the uncertainty of time hung over us.</i>

23:35.280 --> 23:38.630
<i>But... the creeping anxiety that had taken hold of me...</i>

23:39.010 --> 23:41.540
<i>...would soon gradually melt away.</i>

23:41.670 --> 23:46.460
<i>And all that remained would be
the feeling of Akari's soft lips.</i>

24:04.160 --> 24:09.680
<i>We spent that night in a shack
by the side of a field.</i>

24:11.360 --> 24:15.280
<i>Wrapping ourselves in an old blanket,
we talked on and on...</i>

24:15.470 --> 24:17.990
<i>...until finally, we had fallen asleep, side by side.</i>

24:19.020 --> 24:22.300
<i>The next morning, as I boarded the train
that had started its run again...</i>

24:22.380 --> 24:24.580
<i>...I parted with Akari..</i>

24:27.890 --> 24:30.160
Umm... Takaki-kun...

24:30.320 --> 24:30.950
Yeah?

24:32.430 --> 24:33.980
Takaki-kun...

24:34.910 --> 24:37.780
...I'm sure you'll be okay from now on.

24:37.820 --> 24:38.520
I just know it!

24:38.980 --> 24:39.980
Thank you.

24:41.500 --> 24:42.820
Akari, you be well, too!

24:43.570 --> 24:44.550
I'll write you!

24:44.570 --> 24:45.330
I'll call, too!

24:58.690 --> 25:03.660
<i>I never told Akari that I'd lost the letter
I wanted to give her.</i>

25:05.830 --> 25:12.990
<i>Because I felt that my world
had completely changed after that kiss.</i>

25:20.800 --> 25:25.370
<i>All I wanted was the strength to protect her.</i>

25:25.990 --> 25:33.350
<i>With that thought in my mind, I continued to gaze out
over the landscape beyond the window... forever.</i>

27:01.870 --> 27:04.070
Kanae, are you going to go after school, too?

27:04.105 --> 27:05.600
Yeah, are you okay with that, Onee-chan?

27:05.830 --> 27:08.310
Fine by me. But be sure to get to your studies, too.

27:08.440 --> 27:09.450
Yeah.

27:39.840 --> 27:40.510
Okay!

27:55.220 --> 27:56.200
Morning.

27:56.700 --> 27:58.240
Good morning, Tohno-kun.

27:58.590 --> 27:59.890
You're really early this morning, huh?

27:59.930 --> 28:02.300
You too, Sumida. You went to the beach again, right?

28:02.340 --> 28:02.950
Yeah.

28:03.590 --> 28:05.200
You're practicing hard.

28:06.290 --> 28:08.990
I wouldn't say that...

28:09.020 --> 28:10.670
See you later, Tohno-kun.

28:10.705 --> 28:11.380
Later.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.640
Got it? It's time to begin making your choices.

28:16.780 --> 28:18.780
Be sure to turn it in by Monday, okay?

28:19.020 --> 28:21.960
And remember to talk it over with your parents before.

28:23.140 --> 28:26.300
Looks like Sasaki-san's gonna be going to a college in Tokyo.

28:26.320 --> 28:30.020
No surprise there. I was thinking of maybe
going to a 2-year college in Kumamoto.

28:30.055 --> 28:31.360
What about you, Kanae?

28:31.395 --> 28:33.490
Huh? Umm...

28:33.660 --> 28:35.070
Will you get a job?

28:35.105 --> 28:36.190
Umm...

28:36.480 --> 28:38.590
You really haven't thought about it at all, huh?

28:38.625 --> 28:40.665
The only thing on your mind is Tohno-kun, right?

28:40.700 --> 28:43.080
He definitely left his girlfriend in Tokyo, I'm telling you.

28:43.115 --> 28:44.370
No way!

29:11.900 --> 29:13.630
Still not going well for you?

29:13.760 --> 29:15.930
Yeah... what's gotten into me?

29:16.810 --> 29:20.780
It's better if you don't think about it too much.
You'll be able to surf again in no time, I promise.

29:20.970 --> 29:23.030
It must be nice taking things so easy, Onee-chan.

29:23.065 --> 29:24.830
What are you in such a rush for?

29:26.750 --> 29:30.590
At this rate, I won't be able to say it before graduation...

29:49.130 --> 29:50.815
Thanks, Onee-chan.

29:50.850 --> 29:51.925
I can take you home, too...

29:51.960 --> 29:54.190
Don't worry about it. I'll take my bike home.

30:21.850 --> 30:23.570
Sumida, you're on your way home?

30:23.660 --> 30:24.410
Yeah.

30:24.870 --> 30:25.840
You too, Tohno-kun?

30:25.875 --> 30:26.640
Yeah.

30:27.190 --> 30:28.470
Wanna go home together?

30:29.490 --> 30:32.190
<i>If I had a tail like a dog's...</i>

30:32.600 --> 30:37.170
<i>...I'm sure it'd be wagging back and forth right now,
since I'd be unable to hide my happiness.</i>

30:37.390 --> 30:42.470
I was sort of relieved and thought to myself,
"Thank goodness I'm not really a dog... "

30:42.490 --> 30:46.350
<i>...and I was surprised at how foolish I was
for thinking what I did earlier.</i>

30:46.385 --> 30:50.530
<i>But even still, the trip home with Tohno-kun was bliss.</i>

30:53.720 --> 30:59.440
Right from the start, Tohno-kun seemed
a little different from the other boys.

31:00.510 --> 31:01.805
I'm Tohno Takaki.

31:01.840 --> 31:03.900
I'm sorta used to transferring schools
because of my parents' jobs...

31:04.580 --> 31:06.630
...but I'm not too used to this island yet.

31:06.770 --> 31:08.225
It's nice to meet you all.

31:08.260 --> 31:12.850
<i>I fell in love at first sight on that day in the second year of middle
school, and wanted to go to the same high school as him...</i>

31:13.240 --> 31:16.390
<i>...so I studied really hard, was somehow accepted...</i>

31:16.580 --> 31:21.860
<i>...and every single time I saw him,
fell more and more in love with him.</i>

31:21.880 --> 31:24.995
<i>But it's so scary, and everyday is painful.</i>

31:25.030 --> 31:27.340
<i>Yet every time I see him, I'm filled with such happiness...</i>

31:27.380 --> 31:30.240
<i>...that I'm at a loss for what to do.</i>

31:31.890 --> 31:34.240
Tohno-kun, there you go buying the same one again.

31:34.460 --> 31:35.800
It's really good.

31:36.270 --> 31:39.620
Sumida, you always think your decisions
through seriously, don't you?

31:39.655 --> 31:40.500
Yeah.

31:42.820 --> 31:44.050
I'll be outside.

31:44.620 --> 31:45.430
Yeah.

31:46.140 --> 31:47.190
Just this, please.

31:47.250 --> 31:48.920
That'll be 90 yen.

31:49.140 --> 31:49.895
Here you go.

31:49.930 --> 31:51.270
Thanks as always.

32:02.140 --> 32:03.010
Welcome back.

32:03.170 --> 32:04.235
What'd you buy?

32:04.270 --> 32:05.635
Well, it was hard to pick, but I went with this.

32:05.670 --> 32:09.210
<i>Sometimes, Tohno-kun would be writing a text message...</i>

32:09.240 --> 32:11.500
<i>...and every time he did, I would always wish...</i>

32:11.535 --> 32:13.760
<i>...that the text message he was writing...</i>

32:14.730 --> 32:18.240
<i>...would be addressed to me.</i>

32:28.010 --> 32:29.340
Kabu, I'm home!

32:29.490 --> 32:30.710
Kabu, Kabu!

32:30.970 --> 32:32.400
I'm back.

32:52.830 --> 32:55.115
This is a message from your town hall.

32:55.150 --> 32:58.270
The next normal open gasoline stand will be at the
Sakai Agricultural Cooperative Gas Station.

32:58.500 --> 33:01.080
Sumida Kanae-san from Class 3-1...

33:01.290 --> 33:02.825
...Itou-sensei is calling for you.

33:02.860 --> 33:04.680
Please report to the Guidance Counselor's office.

33:04.715 --> 33:05.750
That's your girlfriend, Tohno.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.460
She's not my girlfriend.

33:11.050 --> 33:13.730
You're the only one in the grade who hasn't filled one out.

33:13.880 --> 33:15.090
I'm sorry.

33:15.320 --> 33:18.130
Look, this isn't something someone in my position
should be saying...

33:18.140 --> 33:20.600
...but this isn't really something
you have to wrack your brain over.

33:20.635 --> 33:22.770
Has Sumida-sensei said anything?

33:22.820 --> 33:23.930
No...

33:26.770 --> 33:30.560
If you really can't decide, then how about
a 2-year college within the prefecture?

33:30.780 --> 33:31.460
But...

33:33.590 --> 33:35.940
<i>Onee-chan has nothing to do with it...</i>

33:53.760 --> 33:54.710
<i>After all...</i>

33:56.550 --> 33:59.370
<i>...surfing, even after I pestered my sister
so much to teach me...</i>

33:59.690 --> 34:02.680
...and the most important guy who takes up all of my thoughts...

34:02.920 --> 34:05.930
<i>...are two things I'm still no good at.</i>

34:31.239 --> 34:32.830
Thanks as always.

34:33.040 --> 34:35.770
Not at all. See you next time.

35:04.040 --> 35:06.470
<i>Whenever I go to where Tohno-kun is...</i>

35:06.480 --> 35:10.300
<i>...deep down, my heart... it clenches up... just a little.</i>

35:11.180 --> 35:12.040
Tohno-kun.

35:12.250 --> 35:15.080
Sumida, what's up? I'm surprised you found me way out here.

35:16.170 --> 35:19.290
I saw your bike, so I decided to come on by.

35:19.500 --> 35:20.055
That okay?

35:20.090 --> 35:22.550
Ah, I see. I'm glad to see you.

35:22.860 --> 35:25.470
We didn't run into each other at the bike shed today.

35:25.730 --> 35:26.870
I'm glad, too.

35:27.050 --> 35:28.430
<i>He's really kind.</i>

35:29.160 --> 35:33.120
<i>So kind that sometimes it feels like I'm going to cry.</i>

35:35.390 --> 35:37.480
Hey, are you going to test to get into college?

35:37.600 --> 35:40.400
Yeah. I'm going to take a few for some universities in Tokyo.

35:40.580 --> 35:43.155
Tokyo... I see.

35:43.190 --> 35:45.610
I thought that might be the case.

35:45.830 --> 35:46.890
Why do you say that?

35:46.990 --> 35:49.990
You seem like you want to go far away from here, for some reason...

35:50.600 --> 35:51.780
What about you, Sumida?

35:53.170 --> 35:56.580
I don't even really know what's going to happen tomorrow.

35:56.615 --> 35:58.550
Everyone's the same.

35:58.580 --> 36:00.380
No way! You too, Tohno-kun?

36:00.550 --> 36:01.460
Of course.

36:02.340 --> 36:05.405
You don't look like you have anything to worry about.

36:05.440 --> 36:08.470
Oh, stop that. I'm filled with nothing but worries.

36:08.650 --> 36:12.100
I'm doing all that I can just to keep up.
I have no breathing room.

36:12.780 --> 36:13.790
Really?

36:14.920 --> 36:16.190
I see...

36:23.680 --> 36:24.770
A plane?

36:25.020 --> 36:25.770
Yeah.

37:16.320 --> 37:17.330
Wow...

37:18.820 --> 37:20.500
They say it travels at five kilometers per hour.

37:22.280 --> 37:24.460
It's going to the Minamitane launch facility.

37:25.710 --> 37:29.050
Looks like there'll be a launch this year.
First time in a while.

37:29.085 --> 37:32.390
Yeah. It's supposed to go to the far reaches
of the solar system.

37:32.425 --> 37:34.050
No matter how many years it takes...

37:53.440 --> 37:57.240
Hey... you should really talk to Kanae
about her plans for the future.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.065
You know how absent-minded she can be.

37:59.100 --> 38:02.460
She'll be fine. It's not like she's a child anymore.

38:06.360 --> 38:08.470
I remember when I used to be just like that, a long time ago...

38:10.330 --> 38:14.510
Hear that, Kabu? Tohno-kun apparently doesn't
know what tomorrow will bring, either.

38:14.520 --> 38:16.970
We're both the same. Tohno-kun and me.

38:18.110 --> 38:20.250
<i>It must really be...</i>

38:20.950 --> 38:24.410
<i>...a lonelier journey than anyone could imagine.</i>

38:25.400 --> 38:28.850
<i>To just press forward through
the true pitch darkness...</i>

38:28.880 --> 38:31.980
<i>Barely encountering even a single hydrogen atom...</i>

38:33.220 --> 38:35.810
<i>Wholeheartedly believing
you'll come closer to discovering...</i>

38:35.840 --> 38:39.040
<i>...the secrets of the universe
within the unfathomable abyss of space.</i>

38:44.110 --> 38:47.570
<i>I wonder how far we should go...</i>

38:48.340 --> 38:50.670
<i>How far CAN we go?</i>

39:10.050 --> 39:14.500
<i>I wonder when I got in the habit of
writing messages to nobody?</i>

39:51.830 --> 39:54.270
Kanae, have you decided what you'll be doing in the future?

39:54.305 --> 39:56.945
Nope. Like I thought, I'm still not sure...

39:56.980 --> 40:01.610
But it's all right! I decided that
I'll just take things on one at a time.

40:01.760 --> 40:02.680
Off I go!

40:20.320 --> 40:24.210
<i>Since that day, a number of typhoons
have passed through...</i>

40:24.500 --> 40:28.130
<i>...and the island's
become a little cooler each time.</i>

40:30.110 --> 40:33.570
<i>The wind blowing through the sugarcane
has taken on a slight chill...</i>

40:33.605 --> 40:35.825
<i>...and the sky seems a little higher.</i>

40:35.860 --> 40:38.375
<i>The edges of the clouds have become gentler...</i>

40:38.410 --> 40:43.250
<i>...and my classmates have begun wearing light jackets
when riding their bikes with the change in the weather.</i>

40:58.340 --> 41:01.775
<i>By the time I managed to ride the waves again,
six long months had passed.</i>

41:01.810 --> 41:07.230
<i>Even though it was the middle of October, it felt
like a little bit of summer had been left behind.</i>

41:17.330 --> 41:22.490
The weather forecast for tonight shows a clear evening
with winds up to eight meters per second.

41:22.525 --> 41:25.190
So I heard that Yamada confessed to Sasaki-san.

41:25.280 --> 41:26.770
No surprise there.

41:27.100 --> 41:29.575
Huh? Kanae, you seem awfully happy today.

41:29.610 --> 41:31.650
Something good happen between you and Tohno-kun?

41:32.990 --> 41:33.920
No way!

41:35.580 --> 41:39.580
<i>Today, I'm finally going to confess to Tohno-kun, too.</i>

41:44.830 --> 41:47.140
<i>If I don't tell him today, on the day
I finally rode the waves again...</i>

41:47.175 --> 41:50.020
...I'm sure I won't ever be able to.

42:00.650 --> 42:01.560
Sumida.

42:01.595 --> 42:02.470
To-

42:03.820 --> 42:05.000
Tohno-kun.

42:05.480 --> 42:06.230
On your way home?

42:06.265 --> 42:06.950
Yeah.

42:07.540 --> 42:08.310
I see.

42:08.500 --> 42:10.410
Then, let's go home together.

42:33.140 --> 42:35.750
Huh, Sumida? Decided already today?

42:35.780 --> 42:36.480
Yeah.

42:47.890 --> 42:48.620
What's the matter?

42:56.120 --> 42:57.440
...to me...

43:00.170 --> 43:03.300
No... I'm sorry. It's nothing.

43:11.600 --> 43:12.885
Is your bike acting up?

43:12.920 --> 43:14.870
Yeah... that's kind of weird.

43:16.330 --> 43:17.200
Is it broken?

43:17.220 --> 43:20.340
Yeah... I think the spark plug's dead.

43:20.760 --> 43:22.025
Was this a hand-me-down?

43:22.060 --> 43:23.255
Yeah. It was Onee-chan's.

43:23.290 --> 43:25.080
Did it stall when you tried accelerating?

43:25.110 --> 43:26.560
It might have, actually...

43:27.560 --> 43:29.310
Let's leave it here for today.

43:29.700 --> 43:31.990
You can have someone from your house pick it up later.

43:32.170 --> 43:33.380
Let's walk back today.

43:33.450 --> 43:35.810
Huh? I'll walk by myself!

43:35.900 --> 43:37.570
You go on ahead.

43:37.920 --> 43:39.800
We're this far out, and your place is nearby, so...

43:39.970 --> 43:42.450
And... I kind of want to walk today.

44:18.140 --> 44:20.860
<i>Tohno-kun, please...</i>

44:31.940 --> 44:32.950
What's wrong?

44:32.985 --> 44:33.960
I'm sorry...

44:34.820 --> 44:36.030
It's nothing.

44:36.410 --> 44:37.170
I'm so sorry...

44:39.780 --> 44:40.710
Sumida...

44:42.900 --> 44:45.320
<i>I'm begging you... please...</i>

44:45.710 --> 44:49.220
<i>...don't be so nice to me!</i>

46:23.890 --> 46:27.980
<i>As we humans desperately and recklessly
stretched our arms to the top of the sky...</i>

46:28.070 --> 46:30.920
<i>...and launched something
of that mass and size into the air...</i>

46:30.940 --> 46:34.740
<i>...gazing off into the distance towards something
far beyond our wildest dreams...</i>

46:39.710 --> 46:45.710
<i>...I felt like I somewhat came to understand why
Tohno-kun was different from the other boys.</i>

46:45.870 --> 46:47.630
<i>And at the same time...</i>

46:47.900 --> 46:53.800
<i>...I clearly realized that Tohno-kun
wasn't really looking at me.</i>

46:58.100 --> 47:02.520
<i>Which is why, on that day,
I couldn't say a word to Tohno-kun.</i>

47:16.360 --> 47:18.595
<i>Tohno-kun is really kind, but...</i>

47:18.630 --> 47:20.830
<i>He's so truly kind, but...</i>

47:22.270 --> 47:26.900
<i>But Tohno-kun was always looking far beyond me.</i>

47:26.930 --> 47:30.450
<i>Far beyond me, towards something in the distance.</i>

47:40.430 --> 47:44.260
<i>I'm sure I wouldn't be able to give Tohno-kun
what he truly desires.</i>

47:44.710 --> 47:48.140
<i>But still... despite that...</i>

47:48.230 --> 47:51.800
<i>Tomorrow, the day after, and even beyond that...</i>

47:51.840 --> 47:54.590
<i>...I know I'll still be helplessly in love with him.</i>

47:57.270 --> 48:03.120
<i>While thinking solely of Tohno-kun,
I cried myself to sleep.</i>

49:29.480 --> 49:31.700
<i>I strongly felt...</i>

49:31.790 --> 49:33.680
<i>...that if I looked back now...</i>

49:34.030 --> 49:35.820
<i>...she would look back as well.</i>

49:49.350 --> 49:53.640
The last Chuo line train bound for Tokyo is now arriving.

51:09.630 --> 51:11.730
You should stay till New Year's.

51:11.840 --> 51:14.720
I know, but I have a million things to take care of.

51:14.910 --> 51:16.220
I guess so.

51:16.390 --> 51:18.350
Be sure to cook him good meals, you hear?

51:18.610 --> 51:19.160
I will.

51:19.320 --> 51:22.180
If there's ever a problem, don't hesitate to call us, Akari.

51:22.410 --> 51:23.560
I'll be fine.

51:23.715 --> 51:23.715
The train for platform 2 is now arriving.

51:23.750 --> 51:27.100
We'll see each other at the wedding next month,
so don't worry so much.

51:27.860 --> 51:29.900
You'd better head home. It's cold.

51:50.290 --> 51:53.460
<i>Last night, I dreamt of something from the distant past.</i>

51:54.730 --> 51:58.190
<i>Back when he and I were both still children.</i>

51:58.670 --> 52:01.890
<i>I'm sure it's because of that letter I found yesterday.</i>

52:55.630 --> 52:56.380
Mizuno-san.

52:56.390 --> 52:57.495
Ah, yes, sir?

52:57.530 --> 52:58.530
Have time for that meeting?

52:58.640 --> 52:59.610
Yes, sir.

53:08.250 --> 53:13.410
<i>Through the act of living itself,
sadness piles up here and there.</i>

53:14.500 --> 53:16.395
<i>Whether in the sheets hung to dry in the sun...</i>

53:16.430 --> 53:18.625
<i>...the single toothbrush in your bathroom...</i>

53:18.660 --> 53:20.820
<i>...or the history logs of your cell phone.</i>

53:42.980 --> 53:46.110
<i>"Even now, I still love you... "</i>

53:46.120 --> 53:50.690
<i>That's what the girl I'd been with for three years
said in that e-mail.</i>

53:51.170 --> 53:55.870
<i>"But I'm sure that even if we had written
1,000 text messages back and forth... "</i>

53:55.880 --> 54:00.210
<i>"... our hearts probably wouldn't have moved
even 1 centimeter closer. "</i>

54:08.720 --> 54:14.760
<i>Over these past few years, I've only wanted to move
forward and touch that which I couldn't reach...</i>

54:14.795 --> 54:17.060
<i>...though I've never been able to tangibly define what it was.</i>

54:17.170 --> 54:24.575
<i>Not knowing where those obsessive thoughts
came from, I simply continued to work.</i>

54:24.610 --> 54:29.290
<i>Then one day I realized that my heart was withering,
and in it there was nothing but pain.</i>

54:31.000 --> 54:32.835
<i>And then, one morning...</i>

54:32.870 --> 54:38.870
<i>...when I realized that I had completely lost my
earnest and acute feelings from long ago...</i>

54:39.270 --> 54:41.590
<i>...I knew I was at my limit...</i>

54:41.680 --> 54:43.420
<i>...and quit my job.</i>

55:09.260 --> 55:11.660
<i>Yesterday, I had a dream.</i>

55:11.820 --> 55:14.000
<i>A dream of long ago.</i>

55:14.370 --> 55:18.335
<i>Within the dream, the two of us were still thirteen...</i>

55:18.370 --> 55:22.715
<i>...standing upon the vast field blanketed
in snow as far as the eye could see.</i>

55:22.750 --> 55:26.960
<i>In the distance, the lights shimmering in
houses were set sparsely, far and wide.</i>

55:27.120 --> 55:32.130
<i>All that was left upon the newly fallen snow
were our footprints.</i>

55:32.400 --> 55:33.560
<i>Just like that...</i>

55:33.900 --> 55:37.420
<i>...we wished, without hesitation, that one day...</i>

55:37.430 --> 55:39.185
<i>...the two of us would be able...</i>

55:39.220 --> 55:42.540
<i>...to see the cherry blossoms together again.</i>

55:43.130 --> 55:50.180
I'm always searching for you,
always searching for your figure.

55:50.410 --> 55:53.830
On the opposite platform,
or through window in the back alley.

55:54.090 --> 55:57.530
Even though I know you can't be there.

55:57.860 --> 56:04.840
If my wish were to come true, I would be at your side.

56:05.080 --> 56:08.480
There would be nothing I couldn't do.

56:08.670 --> 56:14.860
I would risk everything to embrace you.

56:23.810 --> 56:30.930
If only to avoid loneliness, anyone will do.

56:31.420 --> 56:38.320
On this night when it seem stars will fall
from the sky, I cannot lie to myself.

56:38.355 --> 56:45.720
One more time, don't fade away, seasons.

56:46.090 --> 56:52.990
One more time, I want that time
when we fooled around together.

56:53.480 --> 57:00.520
I'm always searching for you,
always searching for your figure.

57:00.810 --> 57:04.260
At the intersection, in my dreams.

57:04.430 --> 57:07.980
Even though I know you can't be there.

57:08.230 --> 57:15.210
If miracles do happen, I want to show you right now

57:15.370 --> 57:18.870
the new dawn, who I'll be from now on,

57:18.980 --> 57:24.960
and the words "I love you" that I never said.

57:34.190 --> 57:38.480
The memories of summer revolve around me

57:42.140 --> 57:47.940
and your throbbing heartbeat that suddenly stopped.

57:49.150 --> 57:56.600
I'm always searching for you,
always searching for your figure.

57:56.710 --> 58:00.370
In the city at dawn, in Sakuragi-cho.

58:00.530 --> 58:03.970
Even though I know you can't be there.

58:04.280 --> 58:11.350
If my wish were to come true, I would be at your side.

58:11.560 --> 58:15.020
There would be nothing I couldn't do.

58:15.120 --> 58:18.610
I would risk everything to embrace you.

58:19.030 --> 58:25.900
I'm always searching for you, always
searching for even a fragment of you.

58:26.100 --> 58:29.520
At the shop I'm going to, in the corner of a newspaper.

58:29.750 --> 58:33.120
Even though I know you can't be there.

58:33.560 --> 58:40.410
If miracles do happen, I want to show you right now

58:40.610 --> 58:44.050
the new dawn, who I'll be from now on,

58:44.270 --> 58:47.750
and the words "I love you" that I never said.

58:48.120 --> 58:55.160
I always end up looking somewhere for your smile.

58:55.370 --> 58:58.830
At the railroad crossing, waiting for the express to pass.

58:59.050 --> 59:02.380
Even though I know you can't be there.

59:02.600 --> 59:09.860
If I could live life over again,
I would be at your side every time.

59:10.090 --> 59:13.670
Because I would want nothing

59:13.930 --> 59:20.500
more precious than you.

01:02:37.770 --> 01:02:43.730
The End
