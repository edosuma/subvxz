WEBVTT

00:01.069 --> 00:03.837
(restaurant patrons
talking and laughing)

00:03.871 --> 00:05.539
Oh, nude beach.
Ball pit.

00:05.573 --> 00:06.674
Strip club.
Paddle boats.

00:06.707 --> 00:08.876
LINDSAY: Dildo party.
EDGAR: Turtle races.

00:08.909 --> 00:11.145
LINDSAY: Sex trampoline.
EDGAR: Ah, yes.

00:11.179 --> 00:12.913
Can we do that
at the nude beach?

00:12.946 --> 00:14.982
That could be like third.
What are we doing?

00:15.015 --> 00:16.150
Making a list, ho.

00:16.184 --> 00:17.685
Look around, guys.

00:17.718 --> 00:19.420
Sunday Funday
is so played out.

00:19.453 --> 00:23.757
Oh, no. They've corporatized
your cloying, fabricated,

00:23.791 --> 00:26.194
feckless drinking holiday.

00:26.227 --> 00:28.529
'Tis nothing pure anymore?

00:28.562 --> 00:29.997
But this is our special thing.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.999
It's the last thing
that's distracting us

00:32.032 --> 00:33.334
from the constant dangers...
(glass breaking)

00:33.367 --> 00:35.736
EDGAR:
Jesus!

00:35.769 --> 00:38.172
(exhales)
We have to do
Sunday Funday.

00:38.206 --> 00:40.040
It's my one day
off from Paul.
GRETCHEN: No!

00:40.074 --> 00:42.343
No. You have two choices.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.011
You can either be with Paul
for realsies,

00:44.044 --> 00:45.913
or you can dump him.

00:45.946 --> 00:48.616
I am sick of listening to you
complain about stuff,

00:48.649 --> 00:50.284
and not do shit about it.
Fine.

00:50.318 --> 00:52.253
I won't bring it
up anymore, bitch.

00:52.286 --> 00:54.021
Bad friend bitch.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.556
Hey, you can't take
Sunday Funday away from us.

00:55.589 --> 00:57.525
I love it, too, but, clearly,

00:57.558 --> 00:59.793
it cannot continue
in its current form.

01:01.395 --> 01:06.900
But... maybe with
a little creativity...

01:06.934 --> 01:08.502
(groans)

01:09.437 --> 01:11.305
Well...

01:11.339 --> 01:13.541
legend has it,

01:13.574 --> 01:16.910
there is a bar,
a secret bar, so exclusive...

01:16.944 --> 01:18.979
No. We're not
doing your stupid

01:19.012 --> 01:20.381
scavenger hunt
for some dumb bar.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.082
You pitch it
every Sunday.

01:22.116 --> 01:24.318
It is not just a bar.

01:24.352 --> 01:27.054
It is a secret bar
with a hidden entrance.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.723
A magical land
full of beautiful people,

01:29.757 --> 01:31.225
and strong beverages,

01:31.259 --> 01:34.061
and retro decor,
called a speakeasy.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.229
Bye-bye.

01:35.263 --> 01:37.598
Goddammit guys,
I need this.

01:37.631 --> 01:39.300
I had depression.

01:39.333 --> 01:43.137
That is a legit-ass,
mental-ass illness.

01:43.171 --> 01:45.239
I can't be a pilot.
It's a fact.

01:45.273 --> 01:47.141
Also, Jimmy's dad died.

01:47.175 --> 01:48.476
Yeah. About which,
I didn't care.

01:48.509 --> 01:49.943
And I think we both deserve

01:49.977 --> 01:53.247
to have a little fun
after all that.

01:53.281 --> 01:55.583
Also, there's a bar in L.A.
I can't get into.

01:55.616 --> 01:56.917
That is unacceptable.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.519
Well, accept it,

01:58.552 --> 02:00.588
'cause I'm not going
on a scavenger hunt

02:00.621 --> 02:03.023
to find a speakeasy.

02:03.056 --> 02:05.459
Easily the worst development
in bar culture

02:05.493 --> 02:09.197
since Internet jukeboxes
and big ice cubes.

02:09.230 --> 02:12.766
(whining)
Oh.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.236
(whimpering)

02:19.973 --> 02:21.375
Goddammit. Fine.

02:21.409 --> 02:22.810
I will come along,

02:22.843 --> 02:25.179
but I'm not solving
any riddles.

02:25.213 --> 02:26.514
Fine.

02:26.547 --> 02:28.216
If it keeps me
out of the house...

02:28.249 --> 02:29.683
I'm in.

02:29.717 --> 02:31.519
Oh, can we call it
Sunday Funday, anyway?

02:31.552 --> 02:33.987
Absolutely.
Yay!

02:34.021 --> 02:36.390
I have the first clue bookmarked
on my phone.

02:36.424 --> 02:38.192
The site is blank except
for this dumb symbol.

02:38.226 --> 02:40.160
You can't click on anything.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.700
JIMMY:
Hmm.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.802
Source code.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.538
There.
See those numbers?

02:50.571 --> 02:53.574
They're outside
any command fields.

02:53.607 --> 02:54.908
It's a message.

02:54.942 --> 02:56.577
It's an address.

02:56.610 --> 02:57.645
We won!

02:57.678 --> 02:58.979
Ugh, never mind.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.414
Too short for coordinates.

03:00.448 --> 03:01.582
Maybe it's date and time.

03:01.615 --> 03:02.983
Dewey.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.051
Do we what?

03:04.084 --> 03:05.886
Dewey Decimal.

03:05.919 --> 03:09.089
Do... we... decimal?

03:09.122 --> 03:10.924
Yeah. When I'm
writing money.

03:10.958 --> 03:12.826
Or when I get to
the end of the thing,

03:12.860 --> 03:14.027
and you go "boop"
with your pen.

03:15.128 --> 03:17.698
Boop.
JIMMY:
Jesus Christ.

03:17.731 --> 03:22.236
The numbers refer to
the Dewey Decimal system.

03:24.738 --> 03:28.509
So we should go
to the library.

03:28.542 --> 03:32.713
ALL:
Oh.

03:32.746 --> 03:35.416
GRETCHEN/LINDSAY:
* Sunday Funday

03:35.449 --> 03:37.385
* Better than a Monday

03:37.418 --> 03:39.387
* Can only do it one way

03:39.420 --> 03:40.788
* And that is the drunk way

03:40.821 --> 03:42.356
* Sunday Funday

03:42.390 --> 03:44.558
* Better than a Monday
Puzzles! Mysteries!

03:44.592 --> 03:45.626
* Can only do it one way.

03:45.659 --> 03:48.429
I got it.

03:48.462 --> 03:50.464
*

03:53.401 --> 03:56.637
* I'm gonna leave you anyway

03:56.670 --> 03:58.972
* I'm gonna leave you
anyway *

03:59.006 --> 04:02.276
* Gonna leave you anyway.

04:14.855 --> 04:17.024
(sighs)

04:18.191 --> 04:20.828
Ew, books are gross.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.468
Here Lindser,
I got you a book.

04:27.501 --> 04:28.969
Har-har.
(gasps)

04:29.002 --> 04:30.504
Here's a book
for you.

04:30.538 --> 04:32.406
It's called "How Not to be
a Bitch for No Reason

04:32.440 --> 04:34.141
on Sunday Funday".

04:34.174 --> 04:35.743
Oh, look.
Here's one.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.945
It's called
"I'm Living a Double Life,

04:37.978 --> 04:40.247
"and I Can't Be Myself
Around My Husband:

04:40.280 --> 04:43.016
The Lindsay Jillian Story",
volume two.

04:43.050 --> 04:44.284
Where's volume one?

04:44.318 --> 04:45.486
There is no volume one.

04:45.519 --> 04:46.854
You're just that stupid.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.825
EDGAR:
She he be
doing that here?

04:51.859 --> 04:53.193
That's weird.
Isn't that weird?

04:53.226 --> 04:54.595
I look at porn
all the time.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.664
The bank, the nail salon.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.265
That dog store on Fairfax

04:58.298 --> 04:59.867
that won't let me
foster puppies anymore.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.435
Here we go.

05:01.469 --> 05:02.970
(moaning)

05:03.003 --> 05:04.304
(scoffs)

05:10.310 --> 05:11.545
(gasps)

05:12.813 --> 05:14.114
Look.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.517
"Speakeasies
of Los Angeles."

05:16.550 --> 05:18.386
This must be it, right?

05:18.419 --> 05:20.454
It has most of the numbers.

05:20.488 --> 05:22.222
But then what are
the extra numbers

05:22.255 --> 05:24.324
in the secret code for?

05:26.259 --> 05:28.396
It's a page number.

05:28.429 --> 05:29.797
Obviously.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.064
Oh, my God.

05:31.098 --> 05:33.200
Duh. You're so smart.

05:34.568 --> 05:35.869
(gasps)
There's a photo.

05:35.903 --> 05:38.739
This whole thing's
just so mannered.

05:38.772 --> 05:41.008
A library, rare books.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.810
So twee and completely...

05:42.843 --> 05:44.311
The piano.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.713
Could it be something
about the sheet music?

05:45.746 --> 05:48.315
Ah! That's ingenious.
It's a ragtime.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.050
You can tell from the stride
in the left hand.

05:51.685 --> 05:52.986
What?

05:53.020 --> 05:54.388
I took piano lessons.

05:54.422 --> 05:55.756
Mom used to challenge me

05:55.789 --> 05:57.024
to see how loud
I could play

05:57.057 --> 05:58.225
while her and
her scene partner

05:58.258 --> 05:59.893
ran lines in her room.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.197
Do we know anyone
who knows ragtime?

06:04.231 --> 06:05.966
(sighs)

06:09.737 --> 06:12.339
God damn! These pixels
look big as shit!

06:12.372 --> 06:15.108
So I just got a fun
piece of news.

06:15.142 --> 06:16.777
Shitstain and
Jaclyn eloped.

06:16.810 --> 06:19.079
(gasps)
Oh, my God! Sweetie!

06:19.112 --> 06:21.782
That's amazing.
Congratulations.
Thank you.

06:21.815 --> 06:24.351
Yeah. We were in Vegas
checking out Gilles Goujon's

06:24.384 --> 06:26.253
new schnitzel restaurant
in the Wynn, and figured,

06:26.286 --> 06:28.556
why not start the rest
of our life today?

06:28.589 --> 06:31.358
Yeah. Isn't that a fun surprise?

06:31.391 --> 06:33.527
It puts shit into perspective,
like how you can live

06:33.561 --> 06:37.197
your whole life alone
and... it's-it's fine.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.366
I mean, I'm...
(chuckles) I'm-I'm fine.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.869
SAM:
Now, let's see,
it looks like it could be

06:41.902 --> 06:44.271
the "Hot For Florida Rag."

06:44.304 --> 06:46.707
But...

06:46.740 --> 06:50.811
that repeating figure
could be...

06:52.012 --> 06:53.380
Oh, tricky.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.815
Hold my bigifier.

06:59.119 --> 07:01.254
(playing ragtime melody)

07:01.288 --> 07:02.355
Mm-hmm.

07:03.657 --> 07:05.292
It's called "Happy Toes,"

07:05.325 --> 07:07.294
and it was written
during World War I

07:07.327 --> 07:10.664
by Cornelius
"Eight Fingers" Gimble.

07:10.698 --> 07:14.001
"Happy Toes"? That's the clue?
EDGAR: Oh, I don't...
I don't know. I'm not sure

07:14.034 --> 07:15.803
how weed will affect me
these days.

07:15.836 --> 07:18.438
Actually, studies have shown
that marijuana can curtail

07:18.472 --> 07:20.974
being completely lame.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.644
JIMMY:
Ha! You gave in

07:23.677 --> 07:24.912
to peer pressure.
(chuckles)

07:24.945 --> 07:27.515
This is really smooth.
Keep it.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.082
Do you want to join
the scavenger hunt with us?

07:29.116 --> 07:30.984
(music stops)
Hell no! I am frightened

07:31.018 --> 07:32.753
by puzzles and
general trickery.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.756
The dope thing about this song
is, midway through--

07:35.789 --> 07:37.991
blam--
switches into a minor key.

07:38.025 --> 07:41.428
So it's like "Happy Toes,"
but then it's like "Sad Toes."

07:41.461 --> 07:42.796
(playing in minor key)

07:42.830 --> 07:44.097
Happy toes,

07:44.131 --> 07:46.567
sad toes...

07:48.235 --> 07:49.537
*

07:58.712 --> 07:59.947
(inhales)

07:59.980 --> 08:01.348
So, what's
the clue here?

08:01.381 --> 08:03.350
Hand job massage parlors?

08:03.383 --> 08:04.885
Pupusa ladies?

08:04.918 --> 08:08.455
Girls wearing jeans
that give them long butt?

08:08.488 --> 08:10.157
Poors?

08:10.190 --> 08:13.060
Look!

08:13.093 --> 08:14.494
(gasps)

08:16.429 --> 08:18.298
Ooh. Ooh.
(soft grunting)

08:18.331 --> 08:20.568
(Lindsay groaning)

08:20.601 --> 08:22.402
Give us your secrets!

08:22.435 --> 08:23.571
I guess

08:23.604 --> 08:25.639
he's not
for us. Oops.

08:25.673 --> 08:27.407
Paul would be so good
at this.

08:27.440 --> 08:28.508
You've said his
name twice.

08:28.542 --> 08:30.477
Once more, you summon him like
Beetlejuice.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.846
If you want to say something,
say it to my face.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.848
Fine. A: You're boring.

08:34.882 --> 08:37.317
B: I know it's you who's
been wiping boogers into

08:37.350 --> 08:39.486
my glove box, and
C: you're a liar.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.188
You told me to wear my
stains on the outside!

08:41.221 --> 08:42.756
You can't even let Paul
know you have stains.

08:42.790 --> 08:45.192
You and me--
we're in a fight now!

08:45.225 --> 08:47.227
Good!
(phone ringing)

08:48.195 --> 08:50.263
(gasps)
Ow!

08:50.297 --> 08:51.865
Ow!

08:54.534 --> 08:56.336
WOMAN (over phone):
Sigh for me now.

08:56.369 --> 08:57.838
Oh, my God!
Holy shit!

08:57.871 --> 08:59.339
Sigh for me now.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.741
She wants us
to sigh for her?

09:00.774 --> 09:02.743
Sigh for me now.
How do you
sigh again?

09:02.776 --> 09:04.177
(both sighing)

09:04.211 --> 09:05.746
Sigh for me now.

09:05.779 --> 09:07.781
(all three sighing)
JIMMY:
"Sigh for me."

09:07.815 --> 09:09.416
Cypher. Cypher.
(sighing)

09:09.449 --> 09:11.451
It's a cypher.
It's a code!

09:11.484 --> 09:13.587
Cypher the words
"me now" on the keypad.

09:13.621 --> 09:16.389
Six, three, six, six, nine.

09:16.423 --> 09:18.792
Six, nine.
(laughs)
Nice.

09:20.628 --> 09:21.895
Nothing's happening.

09:21.929 --> 09:23.897
(loud clink in phone)

09:23.931 --> 09:26.566
Oh, my God!
I mean, yes.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.301
It's cool, that.

09:28.335 --> 09:30.270
(gasps)
It's a key!
Baby key.

09:30.303 --> 09:32.139
How are we supposed to know
what it's for?

09:32.172 --> 09:33.807
Where you going?

09:36.343 --> 09:40.113
LINDSAY:
Oh, no. We scared that man so
much, he dropped his typewriter.

09:40.147 --> 09:41.782
He was for us.
I knew it!

09:41.815 --> 09:44.084
And what was the plan
if we hadn't scared him?

09:44.117 --> 09:45.953
Hand it to us? Stupid.

09:45.986 --> 09:48.121
It's okay to admit that
you like this, Jimmy.

09:48.155 --> 09:50.557
I just want to find this bar
so that I can tell

09:50.590 --> 09:52.459
whoever made this amateur game

09:52.492 --> 09:54.928
what a minor league
effort it is.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.429
(both gasping)
What the...?

09:56.463 --> 09:57.665
GRETCHEN:
Oh, my God!

09:57.698 --> 09:59.667
That's insane!
Okay.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.334
That's quite clever.

10:01.368 --> 10:03.737
The masturbating homeless man's
computer took the photo.

10:03.771 --> 10:05.806
But why photos of us?
What does it mean?

10:05.839 --> 10:07.908
That we're the bar.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.843
The bar's inside us.
(Gretchen gasps)

10:09.877 --> 10:10.778
There's something
on the back.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.245
It's a map.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.614
But of what?

10:14.648 --> 10:16.950
Looks like
titty veins.

10:16.984 --> 10:18.351
(giggles)

10:18.385 --> 10:20.120
Train lines, maybe?

10:20.153 --> 10:23.123
Do we know anyone who's
knowledgeable about trains?

10:23.156 --> 10:25.258
Paul is a long-time t... No!

10:25.292 --> 10:26.626
Beetlejuice, bitch!

10:34.234 --> 10:37.971
(crowd chatter)

10:38.005 --> 10:39.606
Wèi, everybody.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.609
I bring Boba,
or bubble tea.

10:42.642 --> 10:47.214
Oh, no! Aah! Oh, no!

10:47.247 --> 10:49.516
I'll just have
a sip of yours.
No, you won't.

10:51.418 --> 10:53.620
You girls and your
antics. (laughs)

10:53.653 --> 10:57.390
Okay, so, the blank map

10:57.424 --> 11:01.628
you sent me is indeed the old
Pacific Electric Railway system.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.396
And you see here

11:03.430 --> 11:06.533
is the one spot they
erased from your map.

11:06.566 --> 11:09.136
We are standing
in the exact spot

11:09.169 --> 11:11.038
of the missing
Red Car station

11:11.071 --> 11:13.506
for what is now
known as "Chinatown,"

11:13.540 --> 11:15.642
or... (speaking Chinese)

11:15.675 --> 11:18.211
It's got to be the
fortune cookie factory.

11:18.245 --> 11:20.447
(gasps)
(exhales)

11:21.681 --> 11:23.350
Come on, Lindser.

11:23.383 --> 11:26.053
Don't you want to come with
your husband whom you love so?

11:26.086 --> 11:28.588
Yes, Lindsay, do come!

11:28.621 --> 11:30.323
I'm busy.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.725
Oh.

11:31.759 --> 11:34.427
(sighs heavily)
Okay, well...

11:34.461 --> 11:35.996
(Paul speaks Chinese)

11:36.029 --> 11:37.664
How's it going?

11:37.697 --> 11:40.267
I went off my meds because
my dick didn't work,

11:40.300 --> 11:42.435
and now I'm totally
freaked out by everything,

11:42.469 --> 11:46.539
but this pot is
mellowing me out, so,

11:46.573 --> 11:48.675
that's an illegal temporary fix.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.844
(rhythmic drumming)
How about you?

11:50.878 --> 11:52.746
I have to Gone Girl myself

11:52.780 --> 11:55.582
and start over
where nobody knows me.

11:55.615 --> 11:58.018
I'm the hottest girl
by, like, millions,

11:58.051 --> 12:01.421
because, you know, America.

12:01.454 --> 12:04.224
(firecrackers popping)
You know, the scariest thing
for me was to decide

12:04.257 --> 12:06.927
that I needed to try to
figure out my stuff on my own,

12:06.960 --> 12:08.796
not just what
they tell me to do.

12:08.829 --> 12:11.464
Maybe before you
do something drastic,

12:11.498 --> 12:14.067
why not just try the thing
you're most afraid of?

12:14.101 --> 12:16.069
You mean ask Paul
to accommodate my needs

12:16.103 --> 12:17.971
within the confines
of the marriage?

12:18.005 --> 12:20.640
You had that right in
the chamber, didn't you?

12:20.673 --> 12:22.810
I mean, sure.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.912
Why not?

12:24.945 --> 12:27.147
So everything triggers you?

12:27.180 --> 12:28.715
(fireworks popping)
Oh, yeah.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.317
I'm worse than ever.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.052
Even, like, small noises

12:32.085 --> 12:34.587
or someone yelling will
just send me, like, to...

12:34.621 --> 12:36.990
Edgar? Turn around.

12:37.024 --> 12:40.928
(drumming,
firecrackers popping)

12:47.534 --> 12:49.202
Has that been going on
for a while?

12:50.503 --> 12:52.672
Holy shit.

12:52.705 --> 12:55.108
I didn't even flinch.

12:58.645 --> 13:00.948
I'll be right...
I'll be right back.

13:00.981 --> 13:04.517
"The sun always shines
after a downpour."

13:04.551 --> 13:07.420
Well, first of all,
meteorologically inaccurate.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.689
Second of all, meaningless.
I don't think the clues

13:09.722 --> 13:11.758
are in the fortunes.
(Paul groans)

13:11.791 --> 13:14.161
I shouldn't have inhaled
all that slippery shrimp.

13:14.194 --> 13:16.263
I'd already chugged
the egg drop soup.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.298
And that whole
fried fish.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.500
I have such a weakness
for Cantonese, Sichuan,

13:20.533 --> 13:23.203
Shandong and
Zhejiang cuisines.

13:23.236 --> 13:26.173
Jiangsu I'm a
little iffy on.

13:27.340 --> 13:30.878
Ooh. Anything to
eat in there?

13:30.911 --> 13:32.145
(Edgar panting)

13:32.179 --> 13:36.349
Immersion therapy.

13:36.383 --> 13:37.817
(siren wailing,
train bell clanging)

13:37.851 --> 13:39.652
(shouting):
Are you sure about this?

13:39.686 --> 13:42.322
(train whistle blowing,
Edgar inhales)

13:45.158 --> 13:47.160
*

13:51.999 --> 13:53.800
Do it!

13:53.833 --> 13:55.202
* Ah

13:57.570 --> 13:59.339
* Ah

14:01.741 --> 14:03.776
* Ah

14:06.046 --> 14:10.183
* Ah

14:10.217 --> 14:13.853
* As the day sets into the sky

14:13.887 --> 14:17.724
* Bottle rockets

14:17.757 --> 14:21.361
* Mothers are calling

14:21.394 --> 14:25.232
* It's time to come home

14:27.901 --> 14:29.369
* Oh

14:29.402 --> 14:31.604
* Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh *

14:31.638 --> 14:33.873
* Oh

14:33.907 --> 14:36.409
* Ooh, ooh, ooh,
ooh, ooh, ooh *

14:36.443 --> 14:39.346
* Oh

14:39.379 --> 14:41.714
* It's time to come home

14:41.748 --> 14:44.751
* Ooh-upa, ooh-upa, ooh-upa

14:44.784 --> 14:47.254
*

14:47.287 --> 14:51.458
* Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh *

14:51.491 --> 14:54.027
* Ooh, ooh, ooh,
ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh *

14:54.061 --> 14:57.965
* Ooh, ooh-ooh,
ooh-ooh, ooh... *

14:59.599 --> 15:01.268
(Edgar groans)

15:01.301 --> 15:03.203
Hey. Hey, wait.

15:03.236 --> 15:04.437
Oh, stop.

15:04.471 --> 15:06.073
(sighs)

15:06.106 --> 15:07.774
You okay?

15:07.807 --> 15:09.609
(sighs, panting)

15:10.743 --> 15:13.080
(panting loudly)

15:13.113 --> 15:15.148
I did it.

15:15.182 --> 15:16.716
(laughs)
GRETCHEN:
Okay.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.485
Come on, guys.
Let's get serious.

15:18.518 --> 15:19.752
What's the next clue?
(mocking):
What's the next clue?

15:19.786 --> 15:20.988
Stop it!
Stop it!

15:21.021 --> 15:22.655
There is nothing here.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.657
We have wasted a whole day!

15:24.691 --> 15:26.393
Look. Look.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.795
Oh, look, look.
Shut up, asshole,

15:28.828 --> 15:30.397
and look at the dragon!

15:30.430 --> 15:32.332
You are a genius.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.934
(inhaling)

15:34.968 --> 15:36.703
That's it.

15:40.173 --> 15:41.641
(beeping)

15:41.674 --> 15:44.177
If it gave me a virus, I'll...

15:44.211 --> 15:45.812
(chimes)

15:45.845 --> 15:48.448
GRETCHEN:
Holy shit.
It's taken over my phone.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.117
Give me back my phone!

15:50.150 --> 15:54.121
(slow beeping)

16:02.962 --> 16:04.731
This way.

16:14.074 --> 16:17.244
(steady beeping)

16:18.311 --> 16:20.413
(beeping accelerating)

16:23.483 --> 16:24.951
(rapid beeping)

16:24.984 --> 16:26.519
(phone dinging)
This has to be it.

16:27.520 --> 16:28.955
I'm tired.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.357
Let's just go to a bar.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.359
PAUL: This does
seem fruitless.

16:32.392 --> 16:34.994
Plus, my stomach
isn't quieting down.

16:35.028 --> 16:37.564
Yes, Jimmy. You got this.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.299
Go, boy. Get us
to that bar.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.734
It's the symbol.

16:41.768 --> 16:43.503
Right there.

16:43.536 --> 16:46.306
The wire is the arc.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.708
The street is the line.

16:48.741 --> 16:51.578
GRETCHEN:
The house is the triangle!

16:51.611 --> 16:53.180
It's the house.

16:53.213 --> 16:55.215
The bar is the house!

16:55.248 --> 16:58.251
*

16:58.285 --> 17:00.253
Of course it's gonna
look like not the thing.

17:00.287 --> 17:02.722
That's the whole stupid point
of stupid speakeasies.

17:02.755 --> 17:04.023
(knocking)

17:04.057 --> 17:05.425
(exhales)
Yeah, but...

17:05.458 --> 17:07.427
this really doesn't
look like the thing.

17:07.460 --> 17:08.861
Shut up.
Have faith.

17:08.895 --> 17:10.397
(people speaking
indistinctly inside)

17:14.033 --> 17:16.236
(woman speaking Spanish)

17:16.269 --> 17:17.870
Oh, uh...

17:17.904 --> 17:20.573
I'm sorry, wrong address?

17:25.945 --> 17:28.381
Well, great, Gretch.
You wasted

17:28.415 --> 17:30.783
this entire Sunday Funday.
You have been

17:30.817 --> 17:33.320
a gigantic bitch all day,
and I'm sick of it.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.124
Oh, are we seriously
gonna do this?

17:37.157 --> 17:38.391
Because I've been waiting

17:38.425 --> 17:40.260
my whole goddamn
life to do this.

17:40.293 --> 17:42.028
I was born to do this!

17:42.061 --> 17:44.264
They were too happy.

17:45.898 --> 17:49.602
They were too happy.
No families are happy!

17:49.636 --> 17:50.870
(grunting)

17:50.903 --> 17:52.372
They were actors.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.374
Jimmy, I think
this is over.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.876
No. In battle,
we risk all

17:56.909 --> 17:59.212
for a taste of
the immortal.

17:59.246 --> 18:01.748
In retreat, sure,
we lose nothing,

18:01.781 --> 18:05.785
but what we gain is
far worse than nothing:

18:05.818 --> 18:07.086
Ignominy.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.389
And shame.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.591
We don't give up
because they make us.

18:11.624 --> 18:13.793
We give up because we're lazy!

18:13.826 --> 18:15.228
Or would rather drink

18:15.262 --> 18:16.896
and watch Treehouse Masters.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.899
Plus, no one tells my girl
she can't go to their bar!

18:19.932 --> 18:21.634
I can go anywhere!

18:21.668 --> 18:24.271
Except Nina's-- she's
mad for some reason.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.805
And Ye Rustic.

18:25.838 --> 18:27.073
The Ace Hotel. Saddleranch.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.441
Sagebrush Cantina.

18:28.475 --> 18:31.411
The Alcove. 4100.
The Tap Room at the Langham.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.346
Oh, my God. How was
I supposed to know

18:33.380 --> 18:35.748
Wolf Blitzer was married?

18:35.782 --> 18:38.551
Once more unto the breach.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.255
(both yelling)

18:42.289 --> 18:44.090
GRETCHEN:
It's gonna be somewhere weird!

18:44.123 --> 18:45.925
A closet, a wardrobe,
the fridge!

18:45.958 --> 18:46.959
Go!

18:53.700 --> 18:56.002
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
(shouting)

18:56.035 --> 18:59.506
Ha. Nice touch.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.344
Upstairs.

19:04.377 --> 19:05.978
Huh?

19:06.012 --> 19:09.549
I don't understand
what you're saying.

19:09.582 --> 19:11.551
Ooh, flautas.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.587
Mexico's spring roll.

19:23.263 --> 19:24.731
(screaming)

19:24.764 --> 19:26.065
Oh, nice acting, dummies.

19:26.098 --> 19:27.166
It's got to be in here.

19:33.740 --> 19:36.175
(toy squeaking)

19:39.178 --> 19:41.314
I really thought
they were actors.

19:41.348 --> 19:43.216
It's okay, Jimmy.
We tried.

19:43.250 --> 19:45.652
It's cool, man.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.154
Why are you so relaxed?

19:48.187 --> 19:49.556
Exactly.

19:49.589 --> 19:52.191
Wait, the police
let you keep your drugs?

19:52.225 --> 19:54.093
So incompetent.

19:54.126 --> 19:57.096
(stomach grumbling)
Excuse me!
It is with great distress

19:57.129 --> 19:59.699
that I must ask
for a moment of privacy.

19:59.732 --> 20:02.835
No, Paul! You are not
using the toilet in here.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.404
PAUL: Were that I
could make it so, wife,

20:04.437 --> 20:06.506
but the situation
has become dire.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.241
GRETCHEN:
Lindser, I'm sorry.

20:08.275 --> 20:10.510
Even though it's
super boring for me,

20:10.543 --> 20:14.013
and believe me girl, it
is like TED Talk boring.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.383
But it's my job to
listen no matter what.

20:16.416 --> 20:18.918
(panting)
LINDSAY:
But you're right.

20:18.951 --> 20:21.554
Sometimes I do wish
he would just disappear.

20:21.588 --> 20:22.822
(wall closes)

20:24.257 --> 20:25.592
(gasps)

20:27.627 --> 20:30.530
I'm a witch.

20:30.563 --> 20:33.199
I wish for $100.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.734
Gather 'round quick.

20:39.939 --> 20:44.143
(latches opening,
all laughing excitedly)

20:49.749 --> 20:52.752
(Edgar giggles)

21:09.669 --> 21:12.772
(jazz music playing,
people talking indistinctly)

21:12.805 --> 21:16.443
(applause)

21:16.476 --> 21:18.578
Welcome, players.

21:18.611 --> 21:21.814
You have traversed a great
and difficult distance.

21:21.848 --> 21:23.450
Congratulations.

21:23.483 --> 21:26.118
A night like no other awaits.

21:26.152 --> 21:27.354
JIMMY:
Thank you.

21:27.387 --> 21:30.256
My, it was an ordeal indeed.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.524
I have so many questions!

21:37.630 --> 21:39.632
Two rye Manhattans please.

21:39.666 --> 21:41.100
That'll be $42.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.536
Oh, my God,
you got to be shitting me.

21:46.305 --> 21:47.607
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

21:47.640 --> 21:48.841
This place sucks.

21:48.875 --> 21:50.176
Speakeasies are lame.

21:50.209 --> 21:51.678
Well, I told you.

21:51.711 --> 21:53.680
But I found it for you.

21:53.713 --> 21:56.182
I beat them.
We wanted each other
to be happy.

21:56.215 --> 21:58.851
Pfft.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.954
(gasps)
Ah, there you are.

22:01.988 --> 22:03.990
Excellent work with the QR code.

22:04.023 --> 22:05.792
Let-let me ask you
about the, uh...

22:05.825 --> 22:07.560
masturbating homeless man.
Was he...

22:07.594 --> 22:09.629
Why didn't you want
to be with me today?

22:09.662 --> 22:13.299
Paul, I can't pretend to be

22:13.332 --> 22:15.234
someone I think
you'd like anymore.

22:15.267 --> 22:18.170
If we have any chance,
I have to tell you what I want,

22:18.204 --> 22:20.072
and you have to decide if
you can live with it or not.

22:20.106 --> 22:23.309
All I've ever wanted
is the real Lindsay.

22:23.342 --> 22:24.677
Tell me.

22:24.711 --> 22:26.178
Your wish is my...

22:26.212 --> 22:27.680
I want to bone other guys.

22:29.015 --> 22:31.317
Physically.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.252
(sing-songy):
No, no, no. Jimmy.

22:33.285 --> 22:35.888
What?

22:35.922 --> 22:37.490
You can't do that.

22:37.524 --> 22:39.225
That would break my heart.
No, Paul,

22:39.258 --> 22:41.260
it's for us.

22:41.293 --> 22:42.929
You can watch.

22:42.962 --> 22:44.263
I mean,

22:44.296 --> 22:45.898
I'd like you to watch.

22:45.932 --> 22:47.233
I want to be a family,

22:47.266 --> 22:49.235
but I also want to be happy.

22:49.268 --> 22:52.772
You want me to be happy, right?

22:56.609 --> 22:57.844
I consent.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.278
(gasps)
Yay!

22:59.311 --> 23:00.547
Mm!

23:00.580 --> 23:02.882
I love you so much.

23:02.915 --> 23:05.552
This is going to be
so good for us.

23:05.585 --> 23:09.355
(exhales, then soft chuckle)

23:09.388 --> 23:11.591
Family.

23:11.624 --> 23:13.225
* Oh, it's right time...

23:13.259 --> 23:15.462
JIMMY:
Hello, hipster dorks

23:15.495 --> 23:16.796
(music stops)
of the speakeasy.
(man whoops)

23:16.829 --> 23:18.230
My name...

23:18.264 --> 23:20.867
is Jimmy Shive-Overly.

23:20.900 --> 23:23.436
And I'm gonna sing you a song!

23:25.972 --> 23:27.474
(jazz music plays)

23:27.507 --> 23:31.243
* Happy toes

23:31.277 --> 23:34.080
* Time to say good-bye to woes

23:34.113 --> 23:37.216
* Every Jack and Jill knows

23:37.249 --> 23:39.318
* She's the gal for me

23:41.187 --> 23:43.089
* Happy toes

23:43.122 --> 23:45.391
* Happiness I will impose

23:45.424 --> 23:47.293
* From New York

23:47.326 --> 23:48.895
* To Idahos

23:48.928 --> 23:52.932
* 'Cause I'm in L.O.V.E.
I'm in love *

23:52.965 --> 23:55.735
This is the last
Sunday Funday, isn't it?

23:55.768 --> 23:58.237
Oh, yeah.
* ...decompose

23:58.270 --> 24:00.740
* Smiles fell like dominoes

24:00.773 --> 24:05.344
* I've lost my gal

24:05.377 --> 24:08.314
* So if you see her,
tell her please *

24:08.347 --> 24:11.283
* That I am crawling
on my knees *

24:11.317 --> 24:12.919
* Happy times

24:12.952 --> 24:15.788
* Please return to me

24:15.822 --> 24:18.024
Yes, indeedy!

24:18.057 --> 24:20.960
* Happy toes,
from now on there's *

24:20.993 --> 24:22.428
* No more lows

24:22.461 --> 24:25.031
* With me and my gal

24:25.064 --> 24:29.301
* I'm on top of the world.

24:31.403 --> 24:34.373
(dog barks)

24:37.409 --> 24:39.411
