00:00.080 --> 00:01.819
(dramatic music)

00:01.920 --> 00:04.980
- How are we supposed to
concentrate? Just look at him.

00:05.080 --> 00:06.460
- Dr. Callaghan?

00:06.560 --> 00:07.980
- Hello again.

00:08.080 --> 00:09.260
Pretty Ophelia.

00:09.360 --> 00:11.900
- [Lucy] Do you know who he's
married to? Roisin Mulvery.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.500
- [Ophelia] The writer?

00:13.600 --> 00:15.620
- Hello, I'm Roisin.

00:15.720 --> 00:18.480
You might know Michael, my husband.

00:19.400 --> 00:20.660
- I'm looking for Michael.

00:20.760 --> 00:21.500
- Michael's gone.

00:21.600 --> 00:22.780
- [Ophelia] He's in Ireland?

00:22.880 --> 00:25.380
- The souls of all the faithful departed.

00:25.480 --> 00:28.740
(dramatic music continues)

00:28.840 --> 00:30.780
- Michael, I'm pregnant.

00:30.880 --> 00:33.940
- [Michael] This is Ophelia,
she came from Roisin's agency.

00:34.040 --> 00:36.800
- Who's Ruth, what does
she think you've done?

00:37.680 --> 00:38.420
(dramatic music)

00:38.520 --> 00:39.220
(panting)

00:39.320 --> 00:42.300
(somber music)

00:42.400 --> 00:44.640
Do you want me to carry on?

00:46.160 --> 00:51.160
♪ Ah, ah, ah, ah ♪

00:54.720 --> 00:58.020
♪ Ah, ah, ah ♪

00:58.120 --> 01:01.460
♪ Ah, ah ♪

01:01.560 --> 01:03.220
♪ Ah ♪

01:03.320 --> 01:05.319
♪ Ah ♪

01:16.200 --> 01:18.720
(eerie music)

01:23.320 --> 01:26.180
(breathing hard)

01:26.280 --> 01:27.220
(wind whipping)

01:27.320 --> 01:30.760
(eerie music continues)

01:50.320 --> 01:53.620
- Ophelia, what are you doing in here?

01:53.720 --> 01:55.460
- I couldn't sleep.

01:55.560 --> 01:57.560
- Well come on, it's freezing.

02:02.240 --> 02:04.240
What is it?

02:09.600 --> 02:11.600
- I saw her.

02:12.520 --> 02:14.520
- Who?

02:15.280 --> 02:16.140
- Roisin.

02:16.240 --> 02:18.460
(dramatic music)

02:18.560 --> 02:21.860
I saw her tonight before you came up.

02:21.960 --> 02:23.980
I looked out of the
window, across the drive,

02:24.080 --> 02:26.740
she was there, standing by the trees.

02:26.840 --> 02:28.660
- Why didn't you tell me?

02:28.760 --> 02:30.580
- I don't know, because it's mad.

02:30.680 --> 02:32.900
I mean, of course she wasn't there.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.380
Of course she wasn't there.

02:34.480 --> 02:35.940
I don't know what's
happening to me, Michael!

02:36.040 --> 02:38.040
- Listen to me,

02:38.720 --> 02:40.340
it's normal.

02:40.440 --> 02:42.380
You're pregnant, you're
overtired, it's dark.

02:42.480 --> 02:44.840
This place can be creepy, let's be honest.

02:45.960 --> 02:47.100
- I can't stop thinking about her.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.460
- Let's not talk about
this right now, please.

02:49.560 --> 02:50.820
- It's the guilt, I can't bear it.

02:50.920 --> 02:52.060
- It was an accident.

02:52.160 --> 02:54.860
- But we set in motion,
the whole chain of events.

02:54.960 --> 02:56.260
We betrayed her and we were punished.

02:56.360 --> 02:57.240
- I thought you didn't
believe in any of that stuff?

02:57.320 --> 02:58.060
(stammering)

02:58.160 --> 02:59.140
(sighing)

02:59.240 --> 03:01.240
- I don't know.

03:01.920 --> 03:04.100
- It was an accident.

03:04.200 --> 03:05.660
A terrible, unfortunate accident.

03:05.760 --> 03:08.220
And if it had anything to
do with divine retribution

03:08.320 --> 03:11.120
it would've been us that
would've suffered, not her, us.

03:15.160 --> 03:16.780
- You're right.

03:16.880 --> 03:19.500
Yeah, of course, you're right.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.600
I'm sorry.

03:27.440 --> 03:29.700
- Have you read that one?

03:29.800 --> 03:32.320
- It's the only one I haven't.

03:33.440 --> 03:36.040
- It's the first one she wrote.

03:39.240 --> 03:42.000
(dramatic music)

03:59.440 --> 04:02.080
(phone ringing)

04:08.800 --> 04:09.820
(Michael groaning)

04:09.920 --> 04:11.060
- [Micheal] Jesus!

04:11.160 --> 04:13.740
- Maybe you should get it.

04:13.840 --> 04:17.700
- I'll get on the first
flight I can, yeah.

04:17.800 --> 04:20.800
And he's still there, right? Okay.

04:23.040 --> 04:25.300
You'll stay with him, won't you?

04:25.400 --> 04:27.400
Thank you.

04:27.960 --> 04:29.220
I'll come over as soon as I can.

04:29.320 --> 04:31.760
Yeah, no, yeah, just straight away.

04:33.520 --> 04:35.620
Thanks.

04:35.720 --> 04:36.540
(soft music)

04:36.640 --> 04:38.640
- [Ophelia] Who was it?

04:43.400 --> 04:45.440
- A friend of mine in Cambridge, Matthew.

04:48.840 --> 04:50.840
My dad's been taken to the hospital.

04:51.560 --> 04:52.740
Collapsed in the house, apparently.

04:52.840 --> 04:54.500
- Oh God.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.600
Micheal, I'm so sorry.

04:58.880 --> 05:00.220
- [Mary] Hello?

05:00.320 --> 05:01.820
- Mary, can you talk?

05:01.920 --> 05:03.060
- Hello?

05:03.160 --> 05:04.060
It's nobody there?

05:04.160 --> 05:05.940
- Mary, it's Michael.

05:06.040 --> 05:06.820
- [Mary] Michael, is that you?

05:06.920 --> 05:08.920
Sheila, it's Michael. Michael?

05:09.880 --> 05:10.700
Michael?

05:10.800 --> 05:13.460
- Yes, yes, for God sake,
yes, it's me, it's Michael.

05:13.560 --> 05:18.100
Listen, I have to go to
Cambridge, my dad has taken ill.

05:18.200 --> 05:20.540
- Oh Jesus, what's
happened, is he all right?

05:20.640 --> 05:22.740
- No, it's fine, he's gonna be fine.

05:22.840 --> 05:25.100
- [Mary] Will you tell him
I'll light a wee candle?

05:25.200 --> 05:26.180
- Okay, I will, listen.

05:26.280 --> 05:27.700
- [Sheila] Who are you
lighting a candle for?

05:27.800 --> 05:28.540
- [Mary] It's Hugh.

05:28.640 --> 05:29.380
- Michael's Hugh?
- Mary!

05:29.480 --> 05:30.540
- Aye, he's taken bad.

05:30.640 --> 05:31.700
- God love him.

05:31.800 --> 05:32.900
- Who the hell are you talking to?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.940
- [Mary] I have Sheila
around for breakfast.

05:35.040 --> 05:37.040
- Listen to me.

05:38.000 --> 05:38.860
I need you to do me a favor,

05:38.960 --> 05:40.740
I need you to check on
Ophelia when I'm gone.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.140
- She's still there, is she?

05:42.240 --> 05:42.980
- Yeah, she's still there.

05:43.080 --> 05:44.580
Look, I didn't want to
leave her, trust me.

05:44.680 --> 05:46.180
It's bad enough people
talking about her here,

05:46.280 --> 05:48.740
but I can't have her with me in Cambridge.

05:48.840 --> 05:49.900
Not until I know my Dad's fine.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.980
- She'll be grand, sure.

05:52.080 --> 05:53.820
- She's seeing things.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.460
- [Mary] What things?

05:55.560 --> 05:56.860
- Roisin.

05:56.960 --> 05:57.700
- What?

05:57.800 --> 05:58.540
- She said she saw Roisin.

05:58.640 --> 05:59.680
- [Mary] Christ, Michael,
how can you have got yourself

05:59.760 --> 06:00.500
into all this?

06:00.600 --> 06:03.500
- She's scared, that's all,
she says she feels better.

06:03.600 --> 06:05.220
- I'm just popping to the loo.

06:05.320 --> 06:06.340
- Just keep an eye on her will you?

06:06.440 --> 06:10.080
- I have to go Michael,
I'll check on the girl.

06:12.120 --> 06:14.320
(sighing)

06:16.080 --> 06:18.480
(soft music)

06:20.640 --> 06:23.480
(toilet flushing)

06:32.280 --> 06:33.940
- Everything okay, Mary?

06:34.040 --> 06:34.900
- Aye.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.260
- You checking I'm washing my hands now?

06:36.360 --> 06:37.500
- Go on back down.

06:37.600 --> 06:39.600
- Can you hear music?

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
- I left the radio on. You head on down.

06:43.280 --> 06:44.620
- Oh.

06:44.720 --> 06:47.960
(soft music continues)

06:57.400 --> 07:00.480
(door lock clicking)

07:21.800 --> 07:26.620
- [Sean] I think JuJitsu's
gonna throw one up, all right?

07:26.720 --> 07:27.780
- I'm making tea, do you want one?

07:27.880 --> 07:29.300
- Yeah, thanks.

07:29.400 --> 07:30.700
Is Michael about?

07:30.800 --> 07:32.660
- He's gone back to Cambridge.

07:32.760 --> 07:35.540
His dad's not well, he'll be back soon.

07:35.640 --> 07:37.820
- I'm sorry to hear that.

07:37.920 --> 07:40.620
Should we press on with the work or?

07:40.720 --> 07:41.940
- Yeah, of course.

07:42.040 --> 07:44.020
- All right.

07:44.120 --> 07:45.420
It's a shame.

07:45.520 --> 07:47.100
I was gonna say you should both come down

07:47.200 --> 07:49.020
to the pub this evening.

07:49.120 --> 07:50.620
We have a wee music night.

07:50.720 --> 07:51.940
Roisin used to love them.

07:52.040 --> 07:54.360
- No, I don't think so,
I'm not feeling great.

07:55.640 --> 07:56.940
- Sure, I'd look after you.

07:57.040 --> 07:58.180
- That's what I'm worried about.

07:58.280 --> 07:59.220
(smirking)

07:59.320 --> 08:01.180
Look, if you change your mind.

08:01.280 --> 08:04.080
(hammer clanking)

08:14.760 --> 08:16.340
- [Alice] Mr. Callaghan?

08:16.440 --> 08:17.180
- Yes.

08:17.280 --> 08:18.020
- [Alice] I'm Alice Milton,

08:18.120 --> 08:19.680
I've been looking after your father.
- Hi.

08:19.760 --> 08:20.620
- Are you both family?

08:20.720 --> 08:21.980
- No, no, no, I'm just a friend.

08:22.080 --> 08:23.060
- It's fine, please.

08:23.160 --> 08:25.020
- So your father came in last night.

08:25.120 --> 08:28.020
He had suffered what's called
a transient ischemic attack.

08:28.120 --> 08:31.220
A kind of miniature stroke,
but with no lasting effect

08:31.320 --> 08:33.460
it's not too serious in itself,

08:33.559 --> 08:34.740
but as I explained to your wife,

08:34.840 --> 08:36.700
it can be a warning that
something more serious

08:36.799 --> 08:37.539
is on the horizon.

08:37.640 --> 08:39.700
(dramatic music)

08:39.799 --> 08:40.659
- My wife?

08:40.760 --> 08:43.700
- Yes. He can go home whenever he's ready.

08:43.799 --> 08:45.660
We'll see how he is in a month or so.

08:45.760 --> 08:48.100
The important thing is
that he is not left alone

08:48.200 --> 08:50.200
for any significant length of time.

08:51.240 --> 08:52.180
Mr. Callaghan?

08:52.280 --> 08:53.900
- Yes, thank you. Sorry.

08:54.000 --> 08:54.860
Oh!

08:54.960 --> 08:55.980
Is he okay to fly?

08:56.080 --> 08:56.820
- Where?

08:56.920 --> 08:59.280
- Ireland, I wanna take him home with me.
- Short flight's fine.

08:59.360 --> 09:01.360
- Thank you.

09:02.640 --> 09:04.420
Hi, I'm Hugh Callaghan's son.

09:04.520 --> 09:05.700
The doctor said he had a visitor.

09:05.800 --> 09:07.940
- Yes, last night.

09:08.040 --> 09:09.300
- Who was it?

09:09.400 --> 09:11.500
- [Nurse] Your wife.

09:11.600 --> 09:12.540
- [Matthew] Oh my God!

09:12.640 --> 09:14.760
- [Nurse] Is something
wrong Mr. Callaghan?

09:17.120 --> 09:17.940
- My wife is dead.

09:18.040 --> 09:21.100
(dramatic music continues)

09:21.200 --> 09:22.060
- [Man] Did you miss your car?

09:22.160 --> 09:23.580
(people chatting)

09:23.680 --> 09:26.440
(engine roaring)

09:28.240 --> 09:30.240
- [Man] There you are!

09:49.760 --> 09:50.500
(wind whooshing)

09:50.600 --> 09:53.200
(door banging)

09:54.960 --> 09:57.960
(suspenseful music)

10:19.280 --> 10:22.000
(dramatic music)

10:23.400 --> 10:26.400
(suspenseful music)

10:39.480 --> 10:42.280
- [Ophelia] I'm such a huge
fan, I just love your books.

10:43.960 --> 10:46.440
- [Roisin] What are you doing?

10:52.520 --> 10:54.060
(dramatic music)

10:54.160 --> 10:55.220
- I thought I could smell her.

10:55.320 --> 10:56.620
(gasping)

10:56.720 --> 10:58.900
It's as though she's right here with us.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.340
- I didn't know you were in.

11:00.440 --> 11:02.580
- Michael asked me to drop
by, check you're okay.

11:02.680 --> 11:04.920
- There's no need, really, I'm fine.

11:08.440 --> 11:10.300
- This is where she used to write.

11:10.400 --> 11:12.480
My favorite of all the rooms in the house.

11:13.600 --> 11:17.700
Sometimes, if she was working
late she'd sleep here.

11:17.800 --> 11:19.180
(suspenseful music)

11:19.280 --> 11:21.280
But not that night,

11:22.440 --> 11:24.440
if only she had.

11:26.040 --> 11:28.040
- It's terrible what happened.

11:29.560 --> 11:31.560
- When I went to see her

11:33.160 --> 11:35.960
I could smell it, her perfume

11:37.960 --> 11:39.960
through the black soot on her,

11:41.080 --> 11:43.060
I could still smell it.

11:43.160 --> 11:46.720
(dramatic music continues)

11:51.080 --> 11:53.520
I'll make us a wee cuppa tea.

11:56.960 --> 11:59.160
(sighing)

12:06.480 --> 12:08.940
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

12:09.040 --> 12:10.340
Blessed art thou amongst women,

12:10.440 --> 12:14.220
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

12:14.320 --> 12:15.300
Holy Mary Mother of God

12:15.400 --> 12:19.380
pray for us sinners now and at
the hour of our death, amen.

12:19.480 --> 12:21.860
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

12:21.960 --> 12:23.060
Blessed art thou amongst women,

12:23.160 --> 12:27.100
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

12:27.200 --> 12:28.900
Holy Mary Mother of God

12:29.000 --> 12:34.000
pray for us sinners now and at
the hour of our death, amen.

12:34.600 --> 12:37.360
(dramatic music)

13:18.680 --> 13:21.480
(people chatting)

13:29.320 --> 13:31.340
- Northern clubs are...

13:31.440 --> 13:34.200
- [Man] I don't know, who is she?

13:37.040 --> 13:40.260
(people chatting)

13:40.360 --> 13:41.900
- Sean!

13:42.000 --> 13:43.620
- Hello, I've been sent to make sure

13:43.720 --> 13:45.620
this wee girl gets herself into bed.

13:45.720 --> 13:48.180
- No, put me down, my mama says

13:48.280 --> 13:50.220
that I can stay up for the music.

13:50.320 --> 13:52.640
- [Sheila] She said no
such thing. Come on you.

13:54.640 --> 13:56.020
- How's it going?

13:56.120 --> 13:58.120
Sorry I'm a wee bit late.

13:59.480 --> 14:00.740
Didn't think you'd come.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.340
- I had to get out of the house.

14:02.440 --> 14:04.560
- Yeah, well, I'm glad you did.

14:06.920 --> 14:08.920
- [Matthew] It's so strange.

14:09.840 --> 14:11.840
- Isn't it just?

14:12.360 --> 14:14.520
- Do you think it coulda
been a journalist?

14:15.360 --> 14:16.660
- Why would it be a journalist?

14:16.760 --> 14:18.760
- She was a successful writer.

14:19.680 --> 14:20.940
You managed to keep that
whole thing so quiet

14:21.040 --> 14:23.580
maybe they thought that
was something should...

14:23.680 --> 14:25.180
- What?

14:25.280 --> 14:28.780
- She didn't, God, I don't
know how to put this.

14:28.880 --> 14:30.780
- Tell me, what?

14:30.880 --> 14:33.040
- Well, she didn't do
it on purpose, did she?

14:34.080 --> 14:36.700
- It was an accident, she
had too much to drink.

14:36.800 --> 14:37.980
- I know.

14:38.080 --> 14:41.160
Of course, I just, I thought
that might explain it.

14:42.400 --> 14:43.980
You know, why you didn't tell me.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.060
(Michael scoffing)

14:45.160 --> 14:46.540
- I did tell you.

14:46.640 --> 14:48.640
- After the funeral, Michael.

14:49.960 --> 14:51.460
You know, I would've liked to
have gone, she was my friend.

14:51.560 --> 14:53.060
- This isn't about you, Matthew!

14:53.160 --> 14:55.860
I lost my wife, for Christ sakes, come on.

14:55.960 --> 14:59.200
- I know, I know, I'm not getting at you.

15:00.840 --> 15:03.260
- I wasn't thinking straight.

15:03.360 --> 15:04.540
- Of course you weren't.

15:04.640 --> 15:06.220
I just,

15:06.320 --> 15:07.380
I could have helped.

15:07.480 --> 15:09.480
- Yeah.

15:12.840 --> 15:14.540
I'm sorry.

15:14.640 --> 15:17.480
(people chatting)

15:20.040 --> 15:23.020
- Do you really think someone
was pretending to be Roisin?

15:23.120 --> 15:26.140
- Aye, unless you believe in ghosts.

15:26.240 --> 15:26.980
- But who would do that?

15:27.080 --> 15:28.180
- I don't know.

15:28.280 --> 15:31.060
(dramatic music)

15:31.160 --> 15:33.160
Hey,

15:34.440 --> 15:35.500
your brother's still a consultant

15:35.600 --> 15:36.740
at the hospital isn't he?

15:36.840 --> 15:38.840
- Yeah, that's right.

15:39.360 --> 15:41.360
- You think he can help?

15:42.160 --> 15:43.980
- He will if I ask him.

15:44.080 --> 15:46.080
- Will you,

15:46.480 --> 15:48.220
for me?

15:48.320 --> 15:50.320
- Of course.

15:51.560 --> 15:53.620
- Thank you.

15:53.720 --> 15:54.460
(upbeat music)

15:54.560 --> 15:57.480
(people chatting)

16:02.600 --> 16:05.620
- Why is everyone staring at me?

16:05.720 --> 16:08.780
- They're not staring at you.

16:08.880 --> 16:11.300
You might be a little bit more
relaxed if you had a drink.

16:11.400 --> 16:12.700
- I'm all right, thanks.

16:12.800 --> 16:14.180
- Sorry, that did sound a bit weird.

16:14.280 --> 16:15.380
- I'm pregnant.

16:15.480 --> 16:16.980
- Oh, thank God for that.

16:17.080 --> 16:18.220
I just thought you might be an old craic.

16:18.320 --> 16:21.760
(upbeat music continues)

16:22.720 --> 16:23.460
Is it Michael's?

16:23.560 --> 16:25.540
- Mary tells us you're
helping with Roisin's things.

16:25.640 --> 16:26.820
- Her estate, yes.

16:26.920 --> 16:28.660
- God, I still can't get over it.

16:28.760 --> 16:30.260
They were that in love.

16:30.360 --> 16:31.660
Michael was mad about
her, you should ask Sean.

16:31.760 --> 16:33.760
Sean will tell you.

16:34.520 --> 16:37.200
He just won't be the same again.

16:39.880 --> 16:41.620
- If nothing else, she's got great timing.

16:41.720 --> 16:42.460
- How did you know?

16:42.560 --> 16:44.060
- Oh come on, I'm not simple.

16:44.160 --> 16:45.420
- Please, don't tell anyone.

16:45.520 --> 16:47.820
- Well, if I was going to I
would've by now, wouldn't I?

16:47.920 --> 16:48.660
- I don't know.

16:48.760 --> 16:51.460
- Look, it's none of my businesses, is it?

16:51.560 --> 16:53.840
Look, I hope yous two can work it out.

16:56.000 --> 16:56.740
(door banging)

16:56.840 --> 16:59.600
(dramatic music)

17:01.720 --> 17:03.500
You're getting the full
experience tonight.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.099
- Who's that?

17:05.200 --> 17:07.579
- Knockdara's very own psychic
healer, Cloda O'Donnell.

17:07.680 --> 17:09.220
- Is she really psychic?

17:09.319 --> 17:10.740
- What do you think?

17:10.839 --> 17:13.660
She lost her little boy as
a baby, which destroyed her.

17:13.760 --> 17:16.060
Went to a commune in Nepal, I think,

17:16.160 --> 17:18.500
and when she came back she said she could

17:18.599 --> 17:19.420
commune with the dead.

17:19.520 --> 17:20.540
- But Sheila believes it?

17:20.640 --> 17:22.099
- No, aye, it's deadly serious.

17:22.200 --> 17:24.700
Sheila sees her once a week without fail.

17:24.800 --> 17:27.800
Sheila's husband died in a car
accident years ago, long ago.

17:28.880 --> 17:31.940
Cloda claims that she can talk to him.

17:32.040 --> 17:34.540
Now I think it's a bit
mad myself, but who knows?

17:34.640 --> 17:36.340
Maybe it gives Sheila some comfort.

17:36.440 --> 17:40.040
(dramatic music continues)

18:06.640 --> 18:09.360
(dramatic music)

18:15.200 --> 18:18.180
- You know, at the risk
of sounding on grateful,

18:18.280 --> 18:22.900
it seems strange to be celebrated
as an exciting newcomer.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.620
As my husband, my
eternally patient husband,

18:26.720 --> 18:28.100
Michael will tell you,

18:28.200 --> 18:28.900
- [Man] There he is.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.660
- it's been nearly seven years

18:30.760 --> 18:32.500
since I started disappearing into my study

18:32.600 --> 18:34.600
for hours at a time.

18:35.040 --> 18:37.620
Now who knows? Perhaps
he enjoyed the peace.

18:37.720 --> 18:38.660
(all laughing)

18:38.760 --> 18:41.140
Thank you so much, I'm
so honored, thank you.

18:41.240 --> 18:45.520
(audience cheering and applauding)

18:48.720 --> 18:52.500
- I found it so, what's
the word? Particular.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.980
- Thank you. It's so good to meet you.

18:55.080 --> 18:56.900
- Has anyone spoken to
you about film rights?

18:57.000 --> 18:58.140
- No, should they have done?

18:58.240 --> 18:58.940
- Yeah-
- Excuse me

18:59.040 --> 19:00.740
just one second, please.

19:00.840 --> 19:01.580
- [Nick] Sure.

19:01.680 --> 19:02.860
- Could I?

19:02.960 --> 19:04.740
- What is it? He was asking
me about film rights.

19:04.840 --> 19:07.700
- Let's get outta here, I
wanna celebrate on our own.

19:07.800 --> 19:08.820
- I can't, Michael, don't be crazy.

19:08.920 --> 19:12.300
- When I saw you up there
I never wanted you more.

19:12.400 --> 19:13.140
- Stop it!

19:13.240 --> 19:15.020
- Come on, I have to have you.

19:15.120 --> 19:17.120
- Michael, no.

19:18.120 --> 19:20.140
I have to talk to this guy.

19:20.240 --> 19:23.080
(people chatting)

19:25.520 --> 19:27.340
- Yeah.

19:27.440 --> 19:29.440
Yeah.

19:30.600 --> 19:31.340
Aye, sorry about that.

19:31.440 --> 19:32.660
- No, no, of course.

19:32.760 --> 19:34.620
- [Roisin] Nick, this
is my husband, Michael.

19:34.720 --> 19:38.020
- Ah, how do you do? Nick
Lawrence Random House.

19:38.120 --> 19:40.900
- Michael's a writer too, he's
just finished his first book.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.500
- [Nick] Oh really?

19:42.600 --> 19:44.600
What's it called?

19:46.840 --> 19:48.920
- Actually, I'm gonna go back to-
- "The Road to Hell."

19:49.000 --> 19:51.620
It's the most fantastic
coming-of-age story.

19:51.720 --> 19:53.720
- You must send it to me.

19:55.520 --> 19:58.560
- I might just do that, Nick, thank you.

19:59.880 --> 20:01.500
I wanna go back to the hotel.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.060
- [Roisin] Okay, I'll see you back there.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.160
- Okay.

20:24.240 --> 20:26.240
Prick.

20:26.880 --> 20:29.360
- Oi, Michael, come here.

20:31.840 --> 20:34.020
Who's a prick?

20:34.120 --> 20:36.120
- Publisher guy, Nick Lawrence.

20:36.680 --> 20:38.760
He asked me to give him a copy of my book.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.240
- That's good isn't it?

20:42.840 --> 20:44.500
- I already gave it to him six months ago,

20:44.600 --> 20:46.600
obviously made quite the impression.

20:47.720 --> 20:49.720
- Oh dear.

20:50.120 --> 20:51.900
(smirking)

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
- Christ, I sound pathetic.

20:55.120 --> 20:57.120
- No, you don't.

20:57.640 --> 20:58.340
- No?

20:58.440 --> 21:00.440
- No, not at all.

21:01.640 --> 21:04.480
(both chuckling)

21:06.960 --> 21:08.960
- Thanks for coming over Ruth.

21:09.400 --> 21:11.340
I know how much Roisin appreciates you.

21:11.440 --> 21:14.540
- Just, oh Michael, I'm so
thrilled for her, you know?

21:14.640 --> 21:16.300
It's amazing.

21:16.400 --> 21:17.140
- Yeah, me too.

21:17.240 --> 21:17.980
And who knows?

21:18.080 --> 21:18.820
Maybe at some point today

21:18.920 --> 21:20.920
I might even get to tell her as much.

21:22.120 --> 21:23.420
- You feeling a little bit left out?

21:23.520 --> 21:25.300
- Very.

21:25.400 --> 21:26.780
I need a lot of attention, you know?

21:26.880 --> 21:29.040
- Oh, you poor thing, you.

21:30.640 --> 21:33.080
(soft music)

22:05.280 --> 22:07.340
♪ They took her away and
they put her in the jail ♪

22:07.440 --> 22:09.740
♪ Weela weela walya ♪

22:09.840 --> 22:12.140
♪ They took her away and
they put her in the jail ♪

22:12.240 --> 22:15.760
♪ Down by the River Saile ♪

22:26.000 --> 22:28.760
(all applauding)

22:30.120 --> 22:31.060
- Well, you did well.

22:31.160 --> 22:33.260
- I've never felt so English in my life.

22:33.360 --> 22:34.300
- Ophelia.

22:34.400 --> 22:35.220
(suspenseful music)

22:35.320 --> 22:37.060
That's right, isn't it?

22:37.160 --> 22:38.100
- Yes.

22:38.200 --> 22:40.660
- [Cloda] I understand
you might want to talk?

22:40.760 --> 22:42.540
- No, I think there's been a mistake.

22:42.640 --> 22:44.640
- I'm rarely wrong about these things.

22:46.480 --> 22:48.480
I can come to the house.

22:49.360 --> 22:51.820
That's where she is after all.

22:51.920 --> 22:52.860
- Where who is?

22:52.960 --> 22:54.300
- Roisin.

22:54.400 --> 22:56.400
Of course.

22:57.360 --> 22:58.620
Whenever you're ready.

22:58.720 --> 23:02.560
(suspenseful music continues)

23:10.240 --> 23:11.500
- Don't let her freak you out.

23:11.600 --> 23:13.020
- I'd like to go.

23:13.120 --> 23:14.300
- Oh, there's nothing in it,

23:14.400 --> 23:16.500
it'll be your money she's after.

23:16.600 --> 23:18.960
- No, I want to leave. Please.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
- Yeah, okay.

23:35.760 --> 23:37.760
- Hello?

23:42.440 --> 23:44.440
Mary?

24:00.480 --> 24:03.400
(kettle whistling)

24:05.680 --> 24:10.180
- There you are, I wondered
where you'd got to.

24:10.280 --> 24:12.180
I was just making tea.

24:12.280 --> 24:13.860
Will you take a cup?

24:13.960 --> 24:17.100
- I told you, Mary, you
really don't need to stay.

24:17.200 --> 24:18.940
(suspenseful music)

24:19.040 --> 24:22.160
- It's all right, I know everything.

24:26.120 --> 24:28.120
I know about you and Michael.

24:31.280 --> 24:34.600
Let's not tiptoe around, things
are better out in the open.

24:39.680 --> 24:41.680
Look, it's done now.

24:44.720 --> 24:46.100
Nobody's blaming you.

24:46.200 --> 24:50.040
(suspenseful music continues)

24:54.960 --> 24:57.000
Michael said you're to have this.

25:00.920 --> 25:02.020
It's no caffeine in it,

25:02.120 --> 25:04.360
you're not allowed caffeine, apparently.

25:05.400 --> 25:06.860
I'm sure it's all mad.

25:06.960 --> 25:08.980
I had a couple o' Guinness every evening

25:09.080 --> 25:12.020
when I was pregnant with
Roisin, it's good for the iron.

25:12.120 --> 25:14.840
These days you're not even
allowed a proper cuppa tea.

25:16.760 --> 25:18.760
- I think I'll take it upstairs.

25:21.040 --> 25:22.420
See you in the morning, then.

25:22.520 --> 25:24.520
- That you will.

25:29.440 --> 25:32.200
(dramatic music)

25:34.200 --> 25:36.920
(phone ringing)

25:45.520 --> 25:46.260
- [Michael] Hello.

25:46.360 --> 25:47.620
- [Matthew] Michael, it's Matthew.

25:47.720 --> 25:49.720
I can't get you on your mobile.

25:50.880 --> 25:51.580
- [Michael] It musta died.

25:51.680 --> 25:53.500
- [Matthew] I couldn't
wait until the morning.

25:53.600 --> 25:54.860
Are you near your computer?

25:54.960 --> 25:56.140
- Yeah.

25:56.240 --> 25:57.380
- [Matthew] I sent you an email.

25:57.480 --> 25:58.860
I spoke to my brother about what happened

25:58.960 --> 26:02.780
and he spoke to the security
and well, open the link,

26:02.880 --> 26:03.900
see for yourself.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.760
(dramatic music)

26:20.480 --> 26:21.460
Do you see?

26:21.560 --> 26:23.560
- Yeah, I see.

26:24.040 --> 26:27.260
Thank you, Matthew, leave it with me.

26:27.360 --> 26:30.080
(dramatic music)

26:35.960 --> 26:38.960
(suspenseful music)

26:41.920 --> 26:44.640
(fire crackling)

27:20.080 --> 27:22.320
(coughing)

27:29.960 --> 27:32.340
(screaming)

27:32.440 --> 27:33.660
(dramatic music)

27:33.760 --> 27:36.560
(Ophelia panting)

27:50.640 --> 27:53.640
(suspenseful music)

28:00.200 --> 28:02.960
(shoes clacking)

28:21.280 --> 28:23.380
(knocking on door)

28:23.480 --> 28:25.880
Ruth, I know you're in there.

28:34.360 --> 28:35.660
What are you doing in the dark?

28:35.760 --> 28:37.760
- I was just leaving, come in.

28:48.760 --> 28:50.500
Michael, why didn't you tell me?

28:50.600 --> 28:53.420
- Yeah, sorry about that,
we didn't tell anyone.

28:53.520 --> 28:54.860
- I had to read about it in the paper.

28:54.960 --> 28:57.040
- I thought it was for the best, you know,

28:58.000 --> 28:58.900
didn't want a circus.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.780
- A circus? She was my best friend.

29:00.880 --> 29:02.880
- She was my wife.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.160
Can't you even try to understand that?

29:12.560 --> 29:14.560
Do you have anything to drink?

29:15.000 --> 29:16.180
- Yeah.

29:16.280 --> 29:18.280
Sit down.

29:24.200 --> 29:26.200
Why are you back?

29:27.360 --> 29:29.600
- My father's gone to the hospital.

29:30.880 --> 29:32.060
- Oh my God, is he okay?

29:32.160 --> 29:34.160
- Collapsed at home.

29:35.280 --> 29:36.500
His carer found him.

29:36.600 --> 29:40.420
I saw him this morning, he's
okay, he's a little frightened.

29:40.520 --> 29:41.380
- What?

29:41.480 --> 29:44.480
- He had a visit last night from Roisin.

29:45.760 --> 29:46.500
- Roisin, what do you mean?

29:46.600 --> 29:49.980
- Please, no, let's not.

29:50.080 --> 29:54.320
He's an old man Ruth, a
very confused, sick old man.

29:58.560 --> 29:59.380
- I'm so sorry.

29:59.480 --> 30:01.460
- [Micheal] Are you?

30:01.560 --> 30:03.220
- [Ruth] I didn't mean to scare him.

30:03.320 --> 30:05.900
- [Michael] What did you mean to do then?

30:06.000 --> 30:07.980
- When Matthew told me what happened

30:08.080 --> 30:10.260
I went straight to the hospital.

30:10.360 --> 30:11.620
It was out of hours,

30:11.720 --> 30:13.020
I knew they wouldn't let me speak to him

30:13.120 --> 30:15.120
unless I was a relative so,

30:17.360 --> 30:21.080
I signed her name, I
mean, I wasn't thinking.

30:22.400 --> 30:24.400
It was stupid, I know it was stupid.

30:25.160 --> 30:26.660
- And what was it you wanted to discuss

30:26.760 --> 30:28.220
so urgently with my father?

30:28.320 --> 30:29.980
- I was worried about him.

30:30.080 --> 30:31.740
I wanted to make sure he was okay.

30:31.840 --> 30:33.300
- You are a saint, Ruth, you really are.

30:33.400 --> 30:35.400
- It's the truth.

30:36.160 --> 30:38.160
- I'm gonna ask you again,

30:38.520 --> 30:41.080
what was it you wanted to
discuss with my father?

30:49.800 --> 30:53.280
- The last time I heard
from Roisin she called me.

30:54.440 --> 30:55.860
We'd had an argument earlier that day

30:55.960 --> 30:56.940
so I didn't want to speak to her,

30:57.040 --> 30:59.040
but, she left me a message.

31:00.840 --> 31:02.740
She was so upset.

31:02.840 --> 31:04.180
Just ranting and rambling.

31:04.280 --> 31:06.700
I mean, I couldn't make out
most of what she was saying,

31:06.800 --> 31:11.800
but, I do know that she was
frightened of something.

31:12.400 --> 31:14.980
The next day I went round
there but I was too late.

31:15.080 --> 31:17.100
She was gone and so were you.

31:17.200 --> 31:20.160
Then I hear she's killed
in a house fire, I mean,

31:21.440 --> 31:23.500
there's something about this story

31:23.600 --> 31:26.500
that doesn't quite sit
right with me, Michael.

31:26.600 --> 31:28.600
- Who cares how it sits with you, Ruth?

31:29.760 --> 31:30.900
Who the hell do you think you are?

31:31.000 --> 31:33.820
(dramatic music)

31:33.920 --> 31:35.920
- All right, I think you should leave.

31:47.880 --> 31:50.300
- You said that to me
before, do you remember?

31:50.400 --> 31:51.140
- What?

31:51.240 --> 31:53.420
- In Ireland, at Roisin's awards,

31:53.520 --> 31:55.620
you said that to me before.

31:55.720 --> 31:57.020
- The night you tried to kiss me?

31:57.120 --> 31:58.340
- Oh come on, you were
flirting with me all night,

31:58.440 --> 32:00.980
those big eyes begging me to do it.

32:01.080 --> 32:02.740
- [Ruth] My God, you really
are something else, aren't you?

32:02.840 --> 32:05.180
- You were always jealous of her.

32:05.280 --> 32:07.940
What was that, exactly?

32:08.040 --> 32:10.300
Did you think you could have her life.

32:10.400 --> 32:12.340
Did you think you could
have me, is that it?

32:12.440 --> 32:13.820
- Don't be ridiculous.

32:13.920 --> 32:15.060
- I'm ridiculous, you the one going around

32:15.160 --> 32:16.660
impersonating my dead wife.

32:16.760 --> 32:17.820
- That's not what that was.

32:17.920 --> 32:19.660
- Wasn't it?

32:19.760 --> 32:20.860
It's in the register at the hospital,

32:20.960 --> 32:22.960
it's in black and white.

32:25.440 --> 32:29.340
Which one of us are they
going to believe, I do wonder?

32:29.440 --> 32:31.220
- Will who believe, what
are you talking about?

32:31.320 --> 32:34.500
(dramatic music)

32:34.600 --> 32:37.620
- Don't go near my father again.

32:37.720 --> 32:39.720
- I won't.

32:43.840 --> 32:46.420
- I thought we could
sit in here by the fire.

32:46.520 --> 32:47.460
Is that okay?

32:47.560 --> 32:49.560
- Yes, it will be fine.

32:58.680 --> 33:01.440
(dramatic music)

33:02.680 --> 33:05.480
(birds squawking)

33:37.480 --> 33:39.480
- Here.

33:49.320 --> 33:54.300
- My grandfather built that
house with his own hands.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.180
- I know, dad.

33:56.280 --> 33:57.220
- Now it's in ruins.

33:57.320 --> 34:01.620
- It's not, it's fine, we're sorting it.

34:01.720 --> 34:03.720
- Huh.

34:06.520 --> 34:08.840
- Look, dad, there's something
that you need to know.

34:10.520 --> 34:12.520
When we get home,

34:13.280 --> 34:15.460
there's a girl.

34:15.560 --> 34:17.340
- What do you mean?

34:17.440 --> 34:19.440
- The timing's awful. I know that.

34:22.600 --> 34:24.600
- Christ, Michael.

34:28.719 --> 34:29.860
What else has been going on?

34:29.960 --> 34:30.699
- Dad, please.

34:30.800 --> 34:31.620
(somber music)

34:31.719 --> 34:33.300
- Did Roisin know?

34:33.400 --> 34:35.400
- Yeah, she knew.

34:36.679 --> 34:38.100
I told her just before the fire.

34:38.199 --> 34:39.580
- Well that's why she'd been drinking.

34:39.679 --> 34:41.260
That's why she was in such a state!

34:41.360 --> 34:44.300
- She's always been drinking, Dad.

34:44.400 --> 34:45.780
Always, she was impossible.

34:45.880 --> 34:48.659
- She was your wife for better or worse.

34:48.760 --> 34:50.580
- Don't you think I felt guilty enough?

34:50.679 --> 34:53.040
I shoulda been with her
that night, I know that.

34:54.639 --> 34:56.960
Jesus, if I could go back...

34:59.760 --> 35:01.760
I can't.

35:09.120 --> 35:12.420
(dramatic music)

35:12.520 --> 35:13.540
- I just wanted to see you

35:13.640 --> 35:16.920
because I never believed in
any of it before I came here.

35:17.760 --> 35:18.740
I never believed in ghosts

35:18.840 --> 35:20.840
or anything.
- Shh.

35:21.640 --> 35:23.640
Quiet.

35:27.320 --> 35:29.260
When did you last see Roisin?

35:29.360 --> 35:30.340
- I'm not sure.

35:30.440 --> 35:31.580
A few weeks before she died.

35:31.680 --> 35:33.840
- No, I mean, here.

35:35.800 --> 35:37.800
You've seen her here.

35:38.320 --> 35:40.660
- I thought I saw
someone outta the window,

35:40.760 --> 35:42.460
standing in the drive.

35:42.560 --> 35:43.660
- And inside the house?

35:43.760 --> 35:44.940
- No, it was just once.

35:45.040 --> 35:46.780
(eerie music)

35:46.880 --> 35:48.880
But there are sounds I hear.

35:50.640 --> 35:52.340
How did you know I'd seen something?

35:52.440 --> 35:54.100
- The man that built this place

35:54.200 --> 35:56.700
shook hands with the devil himself.

35:56.800 --> 35:58.800
A legacy like that lives on.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.820
Bad things happen here.

36:01.920 --> 36:04.780
She's not the first and
she won't be the last.

36:04.880 --> 36:07.640
(dramatic music)

36:11.320 --> 36:13.320
- What is it?

36:14.320 --> 36:15.820
- She's here.

36:15.920 --> 36:17.180
She's listening.

36:17.280 --> 36:20.140
(dramatic music continues)

36:20.240 --> 36:22.240
- What does she want?

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
- She's angry.

36:27.080 --> 36:29.260
- Why?

36:29.360 --> 36:30.700
- Because of what happened to her.

36:30.800 --> 36:33.560
(dramatic music)

36:40.560 --> 36:41.620
- Cloda?

36:41.720 --> 36:42.660
(pipes clanking and grinding)

36:42.760 --> 36:44.760
- Your baby's in danger!

36:45.920 --> 36:47.420
He's coming back.

36:47.520 --> 36:48.820
It's not safe here.

36:48.920 --> 36:51.260
- Please, stop, Cloda, you're scaring me!

36:51.360 --> 36:54.120
(wind whooshing)

36:56.440 --> 36:58.100
- They're here.

36:58.200 --> 37:00.960
(dramatic music)

37:11.880 --> 37:15.300
- Jesus, Micheal, it's
like a icebox in here.

37:15.400 --> 37:16.420
- Have you a wee something for me now?

37:16.520 --> 37:18.060
- Oh, God, can I get it to you?

37:18.160 --> 37:19.260
- I'm not a charity.

37:19.360 --> 37:20.140
- [Michael] Hello?

37:20.240 --> 37:21.700
- I'll get it to you, please, I promise.

37:21.800 --> 37:23.140
- Look after yourself now,

37:23.240 --> 37:24.540
and your wee girl too.

37:24.640 --> 37:25.380
- Girl?

37:25.480 --> 37:26.340
- Hello?

37:26.440 --> 37:29.160
(dramatic music)

37:30.400 --> 37:33.040
- Hi, sorry, I was out the back.

37:37.520 --> 37:39.560
- Dad, this is Ophelia.

37:40.800 --> 37:42.700
- [Ophelia] It's lovely to meet you.

37:42.800 --> 37:44.800
- Sure.

37:45.760 --> 37:47.760
I know you, do I not?

37:48.400 --> 37:51.040
(clock ticking)

37:54.280 --> 37:56.460
- How are you feeling?

37:56.560 --> 37:58.340
- I'm grand.

37:58.440 --> 38:00.820
I'd take a wee cuppa tea
if you're making one.

38:00.920 --> 38:01.980
- I'll bring it.

38:02.080 --> 38:04.080
Go and sit by the fire.

38:12.360 --> 38:16.020
- Hey.

38:16.120 --> 38:17.260
How you been, you been okay?

38:17.360 --> 38:18.980
- Fine.

38:19.080 --> 38:19.980
- [Michael] No more scares?

38:20.080 --> 38:22.080
- No.

38:23.520 --> 38:25.520
- What's the matter?

38:26.240 --> 38:27.740
- Mary was here and she said she-

38:27.840 --> 38:29.840
- I know, I know.

38:30.680 --> 38:32.460
I spoke to her.

38:32.560 --> 38:34.380
I explained everything, she understands.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.020
- How could she possibly?

38:36.120 --> 38:41.140
- Well, I mean, she was angry at first,

38:41.240 --> 38:43.780
of course she was angry, but,

38:43.880 --> 38:46.080
Mary knows how hard I
tried to make it work.

38:46.960 --> 38:48.260
- It just seems so odd.

38:48.360 --> 38:52.800
- Mm-hmm, yeah, she can seem a bit mad.

38:55.440 --> 38:57.960
But she's a good soul. She is.

39:00.240 --> 39:02.240
You don't have to worry.

39:03.640 --> 39:06.620
You know, when I knew that my dad was okay

39:06.720 --> 39:09.120
all I could think about
was getting back to you.

39:19.680 --> 39:22.000
You can relax now, I'm here.

39:31.040 --> 39:33.840
(switch clicking)

39:53.160 --> 39:55.320
(sighing)

39:56.400 --> 40:01.400
- Michael, can we run to another
log on the fire there, son?

40:03.000 --> 40:05.280
- [Michael] We can, surely.

40:13.720 --> 40:16.480
(dramatic music)

40:20.120 --> 40:21.060
- What's that you got there?

40:21.160 --> 40:23.880
- Nothing, dad, just
take it easy, will you?

40:50.080 --> 40:53.920
(pipes clanking and grinding)

41:06.120 --> 41:08.620
(dramatic music)

41:08.720 --> 41:11.560
(Ophelia wincing)

41:30.480 --> 41:31.220
- Ophelia?

41:31.320 --> 41:34.880
(dramatic music continues)

41:41.720 --> 41:44.940
The house is dangerous, the
fire, it infected everything.

41:45.040 --> 41:47.140
Wiring, the electrics.

41:47.240 --> 41:48.540
We think a bulb blew

41:48.640 --> 41:51.280
and shattered glass ended
up in some bath salts.

41:52.400 --> 41:53.940
- Well that musta been a nasty shock,

41:54.040 --> 41:56.140
but everything looks fine to me.

41:56.240 --> 41:57.380
- Oh, thank God.

41:57.480 --> 41:59.300
- It's quite common to experience,

41:59.400 --> 42:02.020
occasional stabbing
pain, or a wave of cramp.

42:02.120 --> 42:04.860
It's often a shock, but
it's nothing to worry about.

42:04.960 --> 42:07.180
- Thank you, thank you so much.

42:07.280 --> 42:09.340
- Now, would you like to
know what you're having?

42:09.440 --> 42:11.820
(soft music)

42:11.920 --> 42:13.920
- [Ophelia] Yes, please.

42:14.840 --> 42:17.980
- It looks to me like
this is a little girl.

42:18.080 --> 42:21.220
(dramatic music)

42:21.320 --> 42:24.180
(cell phone ringing)

42:24.280 --> 42:26.380
- It's the college, I'll be two seconds.

42:26.480 --> 42:30.540
(dramatic music continues)

42:30.640 --> 42:31.500
Hi, Mary.

42:31.600 --> 42:33.180
- Any news, Michael?

42:33.280 --> 42:34.020
- It's fine.

42:34.120 --> 42:36.220
Yeah, it's fine, we've just been in.

42:36.320 --> 42:39.440
- Oh, thank God, been lighting
candles here all last night.

42:42.480 --> 42:43.380
- It's a girl.

42:43.480 --> 42:44.860
- Didn't I say?

42:44.960 --> 42:47.060
Didn't I tell you it was a girl?

42:47.160 --> 42:48.260
- Yeah, you said it.

42:48.360 --> 42:49.780
- [Mary] Everything's prepared here.

42:49.880 --> 42:50.620
(exhaling)

42:50.720 --> 42:53.720
(suspenseful music)

43:18.520 --> 43:20.920
(soft music)

43:29.200 --> 43:31.540
- I thought I could deal
with everything else,

43:31.640 --> 43:33.340
with the house, with the nightmares,

43:33.440 --> 43:37.060
(soft music continues)

43:37.160 --> 43:40.180
but things were about
to get so much worse.
