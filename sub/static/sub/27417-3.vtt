00:03.833 --> 00:04.800
Who did it?

00:04.833 --> 00:06.333
- Albanian.

00:09.600 --> 00:11.500
- Armed police!
- Police!

00:11.533 --> 00:13.500
- Dris Wright, I am arresting
you on suspicion of the murder

00:13.533 --> 00:17.100
of Kamale Robert Lewis
on 10th of March 2011.

00:18.633 --> 00:20.833
- Bruv, I don't know, but don't
worry about it, man.

00:20.867 --> 00:22.833
They ain't got nothing.

00:22.867 --> 00:24.500
- There's still the girl,
though, Kayla.

00:24.533 --> 00:26.300
She saw us. She could ID us.

00:26.333 --> 00:28.667
Do you know something
about this murder?

00:29.633 --> 00:31.433
- You wouldn't wanna get your
mum and your little brother

00:31.467 --> 00:33.033
in trouble, would you?

00:33.067 --> 00:34.367
- I was outside the house.

00:35.500 --> 00:36.733
- It's that one.

00:39.400 --> 00:40.367
I swear, Ra'Nell,

00:40.400 --> 00:42.100
it's like I'm Vincent's slave
or something.

00:57.533 --> 00:58.667
Yo!

00:58.700 --> 01:00.567
What happened, man? Did he
take the food?

01:00.600 --> 01:02.300
Someone's put a hit
out on you, Jermaine.

01:02.333 --> 01:03.367
- Yeah, man.

01:03.400 --> 01:04.567
Me and Mike got asked to do it.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.400
How you gonna do this to your
own blood, fam?

01:07.433 --> 01:08.833
- Yeah, yeah, you might
be my own blood,

01:08.867 --> 01:10.500
but I ain't never
liked you, Jermaine.

01:10.533 --> 01:12.200
What do you mean
he's been kidnapped?

01:12.233 --> 01:13.600
A black and white team.

01:13.633 --> 01:15.633
Jam, bruv. I know where he is.

01:47.200 --> 01:50.200
(* Jacob Banks: "Kids On The
Corner" plays)

01:53.833 --> 01:58.000
* Mmm

02:01.100 --> 02:03.233
* Kids on the corner

02:03.267 --> 02:05.100

02:05.133 --> 02:06.533
- Thank you.

02:08.133 --> 02:10.600
- Brown fish stew and dumpling.

02:11.667 --> 02:12.767
- All right.

02:21.733 --> 02:23.400
- Thank you.

02:23.433 --> 02:26.633
* No chance in hell I'm gon
get through.

02:26.667 --> 02:28.300
* Hey hey hey

02:28.333 --> 02:31.400
* Forever kids on the corner

02:31.433 --> 02:34.300

02:34.333 --> 02:35.433
- Oi!

02:39.800 --> 02:44.800
* Forever kids on the corner
they will be. *

02:45.500 --> 02:47.500
This is doing
my head in.

02:54.433 --> 02:56.600
Jesus.

03:06.200 --> 03:07.533
Who is it?
Me.

03:11.767 --> 03:13.433
- Oi, oi, wait there.

03:14.800 --> 03:15.600
Been using that tooth--

03:15.633 --> 03:16.700
Oi, you been using that
toothbrush?

03:16.733 --> 03:17.567
- Yeah.

03:17.600 --> 03:18.233
- Mm-hm.

03:18.267 --> 03:20.133
- I'm gonna check, you know.

03:33.733 --> 03:36.200
- It's what I told him to get.

03:36.233 --> 03:37.233
That's good, bruv.

03:37.267 --> 03:38.067
Eat this for breakfast, you
won't need nothing

03:38.100 --> 03:39.833
for the rest of the
day, trust me.

03:39.867 --> 03:42.033
- I ain't eating that shit, man.

03:42.067 --> 03:42.800
- I will.

03:44.067 --> 03:45.300
Leave it alone.

03:45.333 --> 03:47.167
- I got this for you.

03:53.267 --> 03:55.167
What is it?

03:55.200 --> 03:57.833
Have that.

03:58.833 --> 04:00.133
- It's a pear.

04:00.167 --> 04:01.800
It's a fucking
avocado.

04:01.833 --> 04:03.033
- That's for you.

04:19.100 --> 04:20.167
- Now, listen.

04:20.200 --> 04:23.033
No names, tell
him nothing.

04:24.067 --> 04:27.033
Wagwan?

04:29.733 --> 04:31.667
I swear I need the
money now, bruv.

04:31.700 --> 04:34.333
If I could sell the car myself,
I would. What's happening?

04:34.367 --> 04:35.400
Rafe?

04:35.433 --> 04:37.433
Rafe

04:37.833 --> 04:39.033
Rafe, where are you, blood?

04:39.067 --> 04:40.633
- Keep calm, brother man.

04:40.667 --> 04:43.533
What you chatting about?
Have you got the cash or not?

04:43.567 --> 04:46.833
- Listen to me. Don't say
nothing. Just act normal.

04:46.867 --> 04:50.033
We're outside, coming
in to get you.

04:53.500 --> 04:55.300
Cool, what?
What's he saying?

04:55.333 --> 04:58.033
- Yeah...
- What the--

05:00.133 --> 05:02.233
You there, bruv?

05:02.267 --> 05:04.100
- Shit! Wrong yard, man.

05:07.533 --> 05:08.600
You're family, man!

05:11.367 --> 05:12.367
Shit.

05:23.133 --> 05:24.467
- Rafe! Rafe, it's me, it's me!

05:24.500 --> 05:27.233
- Right, back up! Back off!

05:28.400 --> 05:30.333
- You're not gonna get away
with this, Sully.

05:30.367 --> 05:31.167
- Slow up!

05:31.200 --> 05:33.067
You're fucking dead,
you hear me?

05:33.100 --> 05:34.500
- Rafe, don't fucking shoot,
blood.

05:34.533 --> 05:35.633
- You're not gonna get
away with this.

05:35.667 --> 05:37.167
- Back up!

05:37.200 --> 05:39.433
We good, Mike?
- Yeah, we're good, we're good.

05:46.833 --> 05:48.333
- Move, move, move!

05:49.667 --> 05:52.500
How the fuck did Rafe know
where we were?

06:00.667 --> 06:01.667
Get moving!

06:04.700 --> 06:06.033
Get in the car!

06:08.567 --> 06:09.733
Get in the car!

06:17.067 --> 06:18.667
Fucking hell!

06:42.367 --> 06:45.133
- So what do you think
of this place?

06:45.867 --> 06:47.767
- It's not for people like me.

06:47.800 --> 06:52.333
Why's it not for
people like you?

06:54.133 --> 06:56.800
Oh.

06:58.067 --> 06:59.467
One sec.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.300
Yo.

07:01.333 --> 07:03.033
What?

07:03.067 --> 07:05.267
Listen, yeah, tell Trevor...

07:05.300 --> 07:07.500
Tell Trevor he needs to calm
down, bruv, yeah?

07:07.533 --> 07:08.767
Show a little respect.

07:08.800 --> 07:12.300
No, no. No, he can wait.

07:12.333 --> 07:14.367
Listen, I've gotta go.

07:14.400 --> 07:17.100
I'll see you in a minute, yeah?

07:17.133 --> 07:18.800
Sorry about that.

07:20.267 --> 07:21.200
- The business you're in...
- I never said

07:21.233 --> 07:23.233
what business I was in.

07:25.400 --> 07:27.600
- The business you're in,
the longer you're in it,

07:27.633 --> 07:30.100
there's only two ways that it's
gonna end.

07:30.133 --> 07:32.400
You either die or you
go down.

07:32.433 --> 07:36.400
You can never fully relax, never
let your guard down.

07:36.433 --> 07:38.333
The biggest joke is you can't
even enjoy the money.

07:38.367 --> 07:40.267
- Well, at least I'm making
money.

07:40.300 --> 07:42.433
- You can make a lot more.

07:42.467 --> 07:44.800
I could help you
make a lot more.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.600
What if I could introduce you to
a person who knows

07:49.633 --> 07:52.200
where the next place like this
is gonna be?

07:52.233 --> 07:54.467
A dump that they turn into
something.

07:54.500 --> 07:56.800
Make a lot of money out of it.

07:56.833 --> 07:59.500
Would you want me to introduce
you to him?

07:59.533 --> 08:04.100
- Look, I appreciate you giving
me these business proposals

08:04.133 --> 08:09.033
and all that, it's nice, but it
ain't my kind of business.

08:24.833 --> 08:26.000
- Hmm.

08:27.133 --> 08:28.800
Where are the flowers?

08:30.833 --> 08:34.300
It's what you do when you visit
someone in hospital.

08:34.333 --> 08:36.600
- Listen, Joe...

08:36.633 --> 08:40.200
I need help on the Albanians.

08:40.233 --> 08:41.667
I need to find their weak spot.

08:41.700 --> 08:43.733
- They don't have one.

08:43.767 --> 08:47.233
Have they
got families?

08:47.267 --> 08:54.367
- I only ever saw them at the
warehouse, fucking swarms of em.

08:54.400 --> 08:57.633
I've been doing a lot of
thinking.

08:57.667 --> 09:01.500
Spent 17 years inside, all told.

09:01.533 --> 09:06.800
Yeah. Been stabbed in the neck,
stabbed in the thigh.

09:06.833 --> 09:09.267
Been run over.

09:09.300 --> 09:12.300
Been betrayed. Been robbed.

09:15.233 --> 09:16.433
Now look at me.

09:16.467 --> 09:18.667
- I'm gonna make sure we get
back what Dardan robbed from us,

09:18.700 --> 09:20.367
you know.

09:22.500 --> 09:24.500
- If you get it back,

09:24.533 --> 09:27.567
you can have my share for a
hundred grand.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.267
- That's a lot less than
you put in.

09:30.300 --> 09:32.500
- That's all I want.

09:32.533 --> 09:35.733
I'm out of it.

09:35.767 --> 09:36.767
Deal?

09:39.633 --> 09:40.633
- Done.

09:59.633 --> 10:02.100
You all right?

10:02.133 --> 10:05.233
You know that person you
wanted me to meet?

10:05.267 --> 10:07.367
You still wanna do that?

10:14.167 --> 10:16.433
This is a unique
opportunity for you.

10:16.467 --> 10:18.600
Why ain't you
putting your money in?

10:18.633 --> 10:22.233
- Cos I earn 32 grand a year
before tax,

10:22.267 --> 10:23.533
cos I've got a mortgage

10:23.567 --> 10:26.400
and my utility bills are going
through the roof.

10:29.167 --> 10:31.600
This is Dushane. Dushane, this
is Malcolm.

10:31.633 --> 10:33.600
- Pleased to meet you, Dushane.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.500
- And this is Peter.

10:35.533 --> 10:36.300
How are you doing?

10:36.333 --> 10:38.233
- Good to meet you.

10:38.267 --> 10:41.233
Rhianna tells me you're
interested in the property game.

10:41.267 --> 10:44.133
- I'm interested in hearing
about it, how it works.

10:44.167 --> 10:47.033
- Basic business principles. Buy
cheap, sell dear.

10:47.067 --> 10:50.233
- Yeah, I do something similar.

10:50.267 --> 10:51.733
- Take this place.

10:52.433 --> 10:55.533
Whole area has been
neglected for years.

10:55.567 --> 10:57.400
We got these buildings for
next to nothing.

10:57.433 --> 10:59.833
Now we're putting up
high-end living units for

10:59.867 --> 11:01.733
young urban
professionals.

11:02.633 --> 11:05.367
- Peter's looking for new
investors.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.367
- No, in another project.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.267
Your neck of the woods,
I understand.

11:10.300 --> 11:12.267
Summerhouse totally
fits our mold.

11:12.300 --> 11:16.633
The landlord wants rid of it.
The council are... supportive.

11:19.133 --> 11:22.467
And we're happy to step in and
make some money.

11:22.500 --> 11:26.600
Basically, the banks are looking
for any excuse not to lend,

11:26.633 --> 11:31.033
so anyone holding cash is in a
very strong position.

11:31.067 --> 11:33.567
You could make yourself
a lot of money.

11:34.333 --> 11:36.133
Have a think about it.

11:36.167 --> 11:37.500
Be in touch.

11:38.833 --> 11:40.000
Rhianna.

11:45.300 --> 11:48.367
I'll take care of
everything.

11:48.400 --> 11:51.733
I'll set up the companies, bank
accounts, everything.

11:56.367 --> 11:59.567
- 15% on everything you get back
on your investments.

12:01.633 --> 12:05.300
All you have to do is sit back
and watch your money roll in.

12:29.533 --> 12:31.267
- No.

12:31.300 --> 12:33.367
I'm gonna make that
landlord see sense.

12:33.400 --> 12:36.800
Cos right now he ain't making
any sense at all.

12:36.833 --> 12:39.733
How does a landlord make money?

12:39.767 --> 12:40.800
- I don't know.

12:40.833 --> 12:44.433
- Rent. I thought you was doing
business studies.

12:45.700 --> 12:48.800
You ain't gonna get any rent if
you've got empty properties.

12:48.833 --> 12:50.033
- Probably not.

12:55.100 --> 12:56.100
- See you.

13:16.567 --> 13:17.833
- Why aren't you in
your uniform?

13:17.867 --> 13:19.700
- Cos I ain't coming to
school today, bruv.

13:19.733 --> 13:21.600
Vincent said I've gotta
drop this thing off.

13:21.633 --> 13:23.633
You gonna come with me, yeah?

13:23.667 --> 13:25.367
- No, no way.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.733
- You don't wanna be going to
school, do you?

13:27.767 --> 13:29.500
- You've gotta get Vincent
off your back, man.

13:29.533 --> 13:31.400
- Yeah, and how am I
supposed to do that?

13:31.433 --> 13:33.433
You gonna help me?

13:33.467 --> 13:36.133
- No, man, you got
yourself into this.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.333
- Yeah, what a friend you are.

13:42.167 --> 13:43.367
The back, you see
how it goes?

13:43.400 --> 13:44.667
See the graduation?

13:44.700 --> 13:46.333
- Sorry.

13:46.367 --> 13:47.100
I'm sorry, Zoe.

13:47.133 --> 13:48.700
- I'm docking your pay.

13:50.767 --> 13:53.600
- Yeah, that's a nice do.
- All right.

13:53.633 --> 13:55.067
Come, darling,
take a seat here.

13:55.100 --> 13:56.733
Call that 60,
then, yeah?

13:56.767 --> 13:57.767
- Yeah.

14:00.133 --> 14:02.533
- Remember, tie it
down at night.

14:02.567 --> 14:03.633
- Cool.

14:03.667 --> 14:05.333
Scarf, yeah?

14:05.367 --> 14:06.333
- Wicked.
There you go.

14:06.367 --> 14:08.467
- Oh. Thank you.
- Thanks.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.500
- Come again.
- Yeah, man.

14:43.600 --> 14:45.600
What do you think, man?
It's nice, innit?

14:47.800 --> 14:50.267
- You don't notice nothing
about my hair?

14:50.300 --> 14:52.800
- No.

14:52.833 --> 14:55.033
You're some ignorant youth, man.

14:55.067 --> 14:56.567
Come, let's go.

15:08.133 --> 15:08.667
- Wagwan.

15:10.400 --> 15:12.567
- You need me to go
deliver something?

15:12.600 --> 15:13.700
Go to Ben's yard again?

15:13.733 --> 15:16.333
- If anything I'll let
you know, innit?

15:16.367 --> 15:17.533
- All right.

15:19.233 --> 15:20.433
- Go on.

15:28.633 --> 15:30.467
Yo! Feds!

15:32.833 --> 15:33.633
- Wagwan.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.333
Look, man.

15:36.367 --> 15:38.433
Second time this morning
already, fam.

15:38.467 --> 15:39.367
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:39.400 --> 15:41.500
- Feds shifted Kayla this
morning, fam.

15:41.533 --> 15:44.633
Went to her workplace, took her
in front of everyone.

15:44.667 --> 15:48.067
- How the fuck do the feds know
about Kayla?

15:48.100 --> 15:51.000
Gotta be, man.

16:07.533 --> 16:08.633
Mum?

16:10.867 --> 16:12.233
Mum.

16:12.267 --> 16:14.100
- Sit the fuck down.

16:16.867 --> 16:18.100
Get comfortable.

16:23.200 --> 16:26.200
Fucking place is a crack den.
Look at it.

16:35.667 --> 16:36.800
- Fucking hell.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.733
What the fuck did Rafe have to
pull that stunt for?

16:42.767 --> 16:44.633
- Sully, fuck off. You brought
this on yourself.

16:44.667 --> 16:45.700
What'd you expect?

16:45.733 --> 16:47.700
- Pay the fucking money,
that's what I expect!

16:47.733 --> 16:49.700
That's all he had to do, pay the
fucking money.

16:49.733 --> 16:51.367
- For fuck's sake. Look,

16:51.400 --> 16:53.233
let me talk to Rafe,
innit, yeah?

16:53.267 --> 16:54.167
I swear on my son's life...

16:55.133 --> 16:56.200
- I swear on my son's life,

16:56.233 --> 16:57.200
I'll tell him just give you
the money. It's nothing.

16:57.233 --> 16:59.167
Blood, this is long.
Let's keep it moving.

16:59.200 --> 17:01.600
This thing's done, innit?

17:01.633 --> 17:04.833
- Ain't gonna happen
now, is it

17:04.867 --> 17:06.767
Rafe knows it's me.

17:06.800 --> 17:08.267
That fucking can't happen now.

17:08.300 --> 17:09.500
- Blood, that's your
problem, innit?

17:09.533 --> 17:12.267
Are you fucking stupid?

17:12.300 --> 17:13.633
- Sorry, Sully! Sully, come on!

17:13.667 --> 17:15.167
Shoot him, Sul.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.100
- I got a son, blood.
Shoot him, Sul.

17:17.133 --> 17:20.133
Fucking shoot him.
- This is my mum.

17:22.533 --> 17:24.367
- It's a toy.

17:27.733 --> 17:28.633
- No.

17:28.667 --> 17:30.133
- What, not even a
little bit to smoke?

17:30.167 --> 17:32.667
- No. Now fuck off.

17:38.367 --> 17:40.367
So what we gonna do with him?

17:46.733 --> 17:49.400
- Stairs.

17:50.067 --> 17:52.400
Thank you.

17:53.567 --> 17:55.833
How'd you get past reception?

17:55.867 --> 17:57.667
- The girl's from Summerhouse.

17:57.700 --> 17:59.533
I know her family.

18:01.100 --> 18:03.633
- Well, she still shouldn't have
let you up.

18:03.667 --> 18:06.300
Look, if you're here about
Peter's project,

18:06.333 --> 18:08.233
all I can say is I'm impressed.

18:08.267 --> 18:10.233
- We'll talk about Peter later.

18:10.267 --> 18:14.233
First I need you to do
something for me.

18:14.267 --> 18:16.267
I need you to do it right now.

18:16.300 --> 18:19.433
- Yeah. There's a girl.

18:19.467 --> 18:21.267
She got nicked.
She needs someone.

18:21.300 --> 18:22.833
- Well, I'll talk to one of our
solicitors.

18:22.867 --> 18:27.833
- No. Has to be someone good
sitting next to her.

18:27.867 --> 18:30.467
It's about the Kamale thing.

18:30.500 --> 18:31.800
- Oh.

18:31.833 --> 18:35.167
The thing that has nothing to do
with you, right?

18:35.200 --> 18:36.733
That's what you've
always told me.

18:36.767 --> 18:38.800
- It don't.

18:38.833 --> 18:40.633
But that doesn't mean that
the feds can't make it

18:40.667 --> 18:42.500
something to do with me.

18:45.300 --> 18:47.467
- I've got a really busy day.

18:47.500 --> 18:49.733
- This is important to me.

18:49.767 --> 18:51.433
It has to be you.

18:51.467 --> 18:54.600
Has to be Now Move On.

19:01.433 --> 19:05.433
- She's here as a witness,
not as a suspect.

19:05.467 --> 19:07.300
- For the moment.

19:09.533 --> 19:11.400
Hello, Kayla.

19:11.433 --> 19:13.800
I'm Rhianna Parkes. I'm a
solicitor.

19:13.833 --> 19:15.833
- Tell them I want the fuck
out of here.

19:15.867 --> 19:17.733
They ain't got no fucking right
to keep me here.

19:17.767 --> 19:19.733
Elijah'll be
going mental.

19:19.767 --> 19:21.400
- My boy.

19:21.433 --> 19:24.133
He's only three and they took
his mum away, fucking wankers.

19:24.167 --> 19:26.433
I told them I don't know
fuck all, innit?

19:26.467 --> 19:27.633
I don't even know why
they arrested me.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.333
- You haven't been arrested,
Kayla.

19:29.367 --> 19:31.067
They've brought you in under
caution to ask you about

19:31.100 --> 19:33.100
the murder of Kamale Lewis.

19:35.700 --> 19:38.767
- I told them I don't know
nothing about that.

19:38.800 --> 19:39.833
- OK.

19:39.867 --> 19:41.500
- If I ain't arrested, I'm
fucking walking out now.

19:41.533 --> 19:44.033
-The quickest way for you
to get home to Elijah

19:44.067 --> 19:46.067
is to be interviewed.

19:58.367 --> 20:00.300
What's this

20:00.333 --> 20:02.500
Thank you. Where's my egg?

20:03.433 --> 20:05.333
It's a boiled egg. I want
a fried egg.

20:06.633 --> 20:07.833
Thank you.

20:17.533 --> 20:20.033
- Hi.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.167
Erin, it's Mummy.

20:23.200 --> 20:25.033
- Mummy!

20:29.467 --> 20:31.200
- All right, I'll have
some tea, then.

20:31.233 --> 20:32.267
Thank you.

20:32.300 --> 20:33.433
- Come here.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.067
Come here, give me a kiss.

20:37.100 --> 20:39.800
Give me a kiss.

20:39.833 --> 20:42.267
You don't like Mummy
kissing you?

20:42.300 --> 20:44.300
You're gonna be a proper
heartbreaker, you are.

20:44.333 --> 20:46.133
- She don't do anything
you want her to do.

20:46.167 --> 20:48.133
- No, just leave me alone!

20:48.167 --> 20:50.167
You're too rude.

20:56.500 --> 20:58.400
- Listen to me.

20:59.767 --> 21:00.767
- Nothing. I'm cool.

21:03.400 --> 21:05.133
I can tell there's
something wrong.

21:05.167 --> 21:06.233
I'm inside here.

21:06.267 --> 21:10.200
If you don't tell me, I'm just
gonna worry, innit?

21:12.400 --> 21:14.333
The feds have started up with
this Kamale thing again.

21:15.467 --> 21:16.733
- But it's nothing
to worry about.

21:16.767 --> 21:18.067
It's bollocks, man.

21:18.100 --> 21:21.367
- Please tell me nothing's
gonna happen.

21:21.400 --> 21:23.067
- Don't know, babe.

21:23.100 --> 21:25.300
- What do you mean,
you don't know?

21:25.333 --> 21:27.067
You can't get nicked.

21:27.100 --> 21:30.567
If you get nicked, what's gonna
happen to Erin?

21:30.600 --> 21:32.100
- I don't know.

22:42.067 --> 22:44.500
- Course I have, bruv.
I've got it right here.

23:08.533 --> 23:12.033
- Sully, please,

23:12.067 --> 23:13.200
I gotta get out of this gaff.

23:13.233 --> 23:15.233
I've fucking had enough.

23:18.233 --> 23:22.167
Where you gonna go,
Mike

23:22.200 --> 23:24.433
If you go out there,
Rafe will get you

23:24.467 --> 23:25.733
and he'll fucking
make you suffer.

23:25.767 --> 23:27.533
When he kills you,
you'll be grateful.

23:27.567 --> 23:30.400
Fuck Rafe.

23:34.067 --> 23:37.167
I can take him.

23:42.233 --> 23:44.533
So what are
we gonna do?

23:44.567 --> 23:47.400
Cos this is worse than
jail in here.

23:47.433 --> 23:49.233
- Are you sure you ain't got
something?

23:49.267 --> 23:51.267
- Darling, please, fuck off.

23:51.300 --> 23:52.500
- Well, this is my house.

23:52.533 --> 23:56.567
- No, we ain't got nothing.

23:56.600 --> 23:59.033
- Well, you must have something.

23:59.067 --> 24:02.100
Why don't you come in my room
and I'll take care of you?

24:02.133 --> 24:03.800
- Yeah, and you'll do that in
front of him, will you?

24:05.033 --> 24:06.800
Just cos I've got a boy don't
mean I don't have a life.

24:06.833 --> 24:08.267
- No, you ain't got
a fucking life

24:08.300 --> 24:09.433
and neither has he
cos of you.

24:09.467 --> 24:10.400
- Oh, fuck off!

24:10.433 --> 24:11.800
- Mum!
- Get out of my house!

24:11.833 --> 24:13.733
- Mum, leave him, leave him!

24:13.767 --> 24:15.833
Leave him, leave him
and go to bed.

24:15.867 --> 24:17.467
Look at this.

24:22.567 --> 24:24.533
You know what?

24:24.567 --> 24:26.467
I've seen some dirty sluts
in my time, Sul,

24:26.500 --> 24:30.200
but, fuck me, she is
one filthy, dirty...

24:30.233 --> 24:31.433
- Oi, Mike.
- ...stinking...

24:31.467 --> 24:32.467
- Mike.

24:38.433 --> 24:40.433
Jase, come here.

24:45.833 --> 24:47.533
I want you to do something
for me, yeah?

24:47.567 --> 24:48.567
- Yeah.

25:35.467 --> 25:37.533
- Due to the extremely high
standards shown at the youth

25:37.567 --> 25:41.233
squad trial last week, we
regret to inform you...

25:44.500 --> 25:45.500
Shit!

25:46.567 --> 25:47.567
Fuck!

25:48.600 --> 25:51.200
For fuck's sake!

25:52.267 --> 25:53.433
- Fuck off!

25:55.167 --> 25:56.300
Ra'Nell!

25:57.800 --> 25:58.767
Ra'Nell!

26:02.400 --> 26:03.433
- You should have seen it, man.

26:03.467 --> 26:07.033
He chopped off his arm right in
front of my face.

26:07.067 --> 26:09.167
Fuck Vince.

26:12.400 --> 26:14.567
- Teaching you how
to be a man. Move.

26:16.167 --> 26:17.733
Oi!

26:17.767 --> 26:19.433
Oi, you fucking pussy!

26:19.467 --> 26:21.600
Lay off my friend! Do you
understand me?

26:24.067 --> 26:25.267
Leave him alone!

26:26.233 --> 26:27.067
Stop!

26:27.433 --> 26:28.433
Stop!

26:36.067 --> 26:37.767
First you kill my plants,

26:37.800 --> 26:39.167
then you lose my drugs.

26:39.200 --> 26:41.200
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

26:46.200 --> 26:47.200
- Fuck off!

26:54.833 --> 26:56.600
- Get off me!

27:08.200 --> 27:11.400
Was Kamale Lewis
your boyfriend?

27:11.433 --> 27:13.600
- What is the relevance
of that question?

27:13.633 --> 27:16.100
- I'm seeking to establish the
nature of the relationship

27:16.133 --> 27:18.733
between Kamale and Kayla.

27:18.767 --> 27:23.533
Did Kamale come to visit you at
your home in London Fields

27:23.567 --> 27:27.400
on the evening of the 10th
of March last year?

27:29.367 --> 27:30.767
- No comment.

27:30.800 --> 27:32.633
Did you have sexual
relations with Kamale?

27:32.667 --> 27:35.600
- That question is totally
inappropriate.

27:35.633 --> 27:37.767
I'd like the record to show my
formal objection.

27:37.800 --> 27:40.800
- Did Kamale come to visit you
on the night of March the 10th

27:40.833 --> 27:42.467
last year?

27:45.800 --> 27:47.567
- No comment.

27:47.600 --> 27:50.667
- After Kamale arrived, did
three other men arrive?

27:50.700 --> 27:51.533
- No comment.

27:51.567 --> 27:52.533
- Was Dris Wright one
of those men?

27:52.567 --> 27:53.500
- No comment.

27:53.533 --> 27:55.167
- Was Gerard Sullivan, also
known as Sully,

27:55.200 --> 27:56.200
one of those men?

27:56.233 --> 27:57.100
- No comment.

27:57.133 --> 27:57.967
- Was Dushane Hill
one of those men?

27:58.000 --> 27:58.967
- I'm getting fucking
bored of this.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.333
Was Dushane Hill
one of those men?

28:00.367 --> 28:02.200
- No comment.

28:11.267 --> 28:12.567
You heard feds have been
sniffing about this

28:12.600 --> 28:14.067
Kamale thing, innit?

28:14.100 --> 28:15.767
- No.

28:15.800 --> 28:16.967
- No, I ain't heard nothing.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.167
- So you're telling me you ain't
seen none of the posters,

28:19.200 --> 28:22.133
none of the fliers, with
Kamale's face all over it?

28:22.167 --> 28:23.333
You ain't seen them?

28:23.367 --> 28:24.200
- Yeah, I have.

28:25.767 --> 28:26.600
- Yeah.
- So why you telling me

28:26.633 --> 28:29.200
you ain't heard nothing
about no feds?

28:33.100 --> 28:35.267
Anyone ask you anything about
that night?

28:35.300 --> 28:36.500
- No.

28:36.533 --> 28:38.433
- If anyone asks anything, you
know what you're gonna say?

28:38.467 --> 28:40.400
- I say that I ain't
heard nothing.

28:40.433 --> 28:40.967
- Good.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.300
Little shit!

28:42.333 --> 28:45.200
- Oi! Oi!
- You're fucking dead.

28:45.233 --> 28:46.567
Oi, what you doing?
Move!

28:46.600 --> 28:47.767
Move!

28:47.800 --> 28:48.733
Blood, that's the
youth that robbed Michael.

28:48.767 --> 28:49.800
Get up.
What you doing?

28:49.833 --> 28:52.233
- I got a message for you.

28:52.267 --> 28:52.900
From Sully.

28:52.933 --> 28:55.433
What's it about

29:01.600 --> 29:03.267
- Dushane.

29:04.067 --> 29:05.567
Yo, blood.

29:06.167 --> 29:08.633
Blood, them men have done fucked
me up already, you know, blood.

29:08.667 --> 29:12.200
Listen, chat to Rafe, innit? My
brother respects you, fam.

29:12.233 --> 29:14.167
Oi, this is mad, fam.

29:14.200 --> 29:15.200
Oi--

29:27.100 --> 29:29.267
- Look, you tell Rafe

29:29.300 --> 29:32.533
deal's still on the table, but
if he fucks about,

29:32.567 --> 29:35.633
I'll fucking kill Jermaine.

29:35.667 --> 29:37.767
I'll shoot him dead, Dushane.

29:37.800 --> 29:40.167
- Sully, the deal's dead.

29:40.200 --> 29:41.800
Have you heard them
stories about Rafe

29:41.833 --> 29:44.467
torturing that brother in
Finsbury Park?

29:44.500 --> 29:48.300
When they found him, his eyes
was cut out.

29:48.333 --> 29:50.600
Look, I can help you, yeah?

29:50.633 --> 29:53.133
But you have to do
something for me.

29:56.567 --> 29:58.567
- Someone nicked my food.

30:01.533 --> 30:03.400
Haven't been there before.

30:03.433 --> 30:05.400
Know where it is?

30:05.433 --> 30:07.100
- I know who took it.

30:07.133 --> 30:09.300
I know where he is.

30:12.800 --> 30:14.833
- Look, you think you can make
Rafe see sense here?

30:14.867 --> 30:16.433
- He will listen to me.

30:16.467 --> 30:18.433
Trust me.

30:18.467 --> 30:20.400
- Rafe, man...

30:20.433 --> 30:22.433
Sneaky fucker, you know.

30:24.333 --> 30:27.733
Trust me, he will say to your
face there's no problem,

30:27.767 --> 30:31.267
wait till everything's died
down, sneak up on man...

30:32.733 --> 30:35.233
It's fucking done, yeah?

30:35.267 --> 30:36.667
- I'm saying you're my blood,

30:36.700 --> 30:39.767
and I ain't gonna let that
happen to you.

30:41.633 --> 30:43.033
That's gotta be part of the
guarantee.

30:43.067 --> 30:45.500
I don't want no comebacks on
Mike neither.

30:45.533 --> 30:47.767
- You just guarantee me that you
don't do nothing to Jermaine

30:47.800 --> 30:49.800
until you hear from me, yeah?

30:58.500 --> 30:59.500
- All right.

31:31.433 --> 31:32.533
Ra'Nell?

31:33.633 --> 31:34.833
Ra'Nell? Oh, my God!

31:34.867 --> 31:37.233
Oh, shit.

31:37.267 --> 31:39.033
Oh, shit.
- Ra'Nell...

31:39.067 --> 31:40.767
Who did that?

31:40.800 --> 31:43.800
Babe. Zoe...

31:45.200 --> 31:46.600
Should we take him to
the hospital?

31:46.633 --> 31:47.567
Ra'Nell...

31:47.600 --> 31:49.733
I don't wanna go
to the hospital.

31:49.767 --> 31:51.600
What happened?

31:54.300 --> 31:55.267
- Nothing.

31:55.300 --> 31:57.167
- Don't keep saying that.

31:57.200 --> 31:59.267
Tell me what happened.

31:59.300 --> 32:02.067
Who did this to you?

32:02.100 --> 32:03.567
Who?

32:03.600 --> 32:05.100
- The Chinaman.

32:07.300 --> 32:08.300
Vincent.

32:09.633 --> 32:10.700
He has a shop.

32:10.733 --> 32:14.133
Right, that's it. I'm
calling the police.

32:14.167 --> 32:15.700
- You can't call the police.

32:15.733 --> 32:16.767
- I have to call the police!

32:16.800 --> 32:18.700
He can't just beat my child
up and think he can

32:18.733 --> 32:19.733
get away with it!

32:19.767 --> 32:22.500
Can't call
the police.

32:30.400 --> 32:33.100
- Yo, it's me. How's it
going with Kayla?

32:33.133 --> 32:34.800
Call me back, yeah?

32:52.067 --> 32:53.400
- I need to talk to you about
Jermaine.

32:53.433 --> 32:55.767
- Keep your hands on the table.

33:01.067 --> 33:02.600
- How am I gonna get my brethren
out of this problem?

33:02.633 --> 33:04.300
- Wasting your time, Dushane.

33:04.333 --> 33:07.267
Sully's my cousin, yeah, but he
kidnapped his own blood.

33:07.300 --> 33:08.333
Sully's dead,

33:08.367 --> 33:12.033
him and that guy, Mike, and it
won't be painless.

33:12.067 --> 33:13.567
- You want your own
brother to die?

33:13.600 --> 33:15.133
- Jermaine ain't gonna
live through this,

33:15.167 --> 33:17.167
we already know that.

33:18.467 --> 33:20.800
- I can get you Jermaine back
alive, yeah?

33:20.833 --> 33:22.000
And I can give you the name

33:22.033 --> 33:25.800
of the guy that put the hit out
on him in the first place.

33:25.833 --> 33:29.000
And I'll throw some paper your
way. What you say?

33:30.733 --> 33:32.733
- There was a hit out on
Jermaine?

33:38.833 --> 33:41.500
- The wrong fucking noodles,
you fuck!

33:44.200 --> 33:45.200
Huh?

33:56.400 --> 33:57.633
- If the rap don't work

33:57.667 --> 33:59.200
Ima grind till my peez is up

33:59.233 --> 34:01.533
Their crack in my mouth...

34:01.567 --> 34:03.567
If I get the low-down then I'm
creeping up.

34:03.600 --> 34:04.367
Black mask

34:04.400 --> 34:06.067
You know I'm gonna
thieve the box.

34:06.100 --> 34:07.367
Ride out--

34:07.400 --> 34:10.067
Where the fuck's my
brother Huh?

34:10.100 --> 34:11.533
- Hey, come out, man.
Hurry up, blood.

34:13.867 --> 34:14.800
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

34:14.833 --> 34:16.633
- Hey Tony, you better talk
quick, you know.

34:16.667 --> 34:17.633
- Who put the fucking hit out on
Jermaine, bruv?

34:17.667 --> 34:19.600
You better fucking tell me
before I kill you!

34:19.633 --> 34:21.600
- Fuck me, do you know what
you're asking?

34:21.633 --> 34:23.267
- Bruv, tell him.

34:24.833 --> 34:26.700
- The York brothers.

34:26.733 --> 34:28.733
- All three of them.

34:30.400 --> 34:31.400
- Come.

34:33.300 --> 34:35.100
Now you got the
source of your problem.

34:35.133 --> 34:37.267
You said you were gonna
put some paper on the table.

34:43.167 --> 34:44.467
- All right, make it five.

34:44.500 --> 34:47.133
- Bruv, I'll make it three,
yeah?

34:47.167 --> 34:50.167
And after that there can't be no
comebacks on Sully.

34:50.200 --> 34:51.200
Never.

34:52.667 --> 34:55.500
And if anything happens
to him, bruv...

34:55.533 --> 34:56.700
Yeah, you know what's
gonna happen.

34:56.733 --> 34:58.700
- So, what, is Mike
your brother too?

34:58.733 --> 34:59.533
- No.

34:59.567 --> 35:01.233
- Cos someone's gotta pay.

35:01.267 --> 35:03.600
You understand what I'm saying?

35:37.100 --> 35:39.567
I'm gonna have to
call the police.

35:39.600 --> 35:41.067
- You don't understand.

35:41.100 --> 35:43.200
If you call the police,
Gem gets killed.

35:43.233 --> 35:45.600
- Not if that man's in
prison, he won't.

35:45.633 --> 35:48.367
- Vincent has friends
that'll do anything.

35:58.633 --> 36:01.300
Look at you, Ra'Nell. We can't
just leave this.

36:01.333 --> 36:03.100
- Gonna have to leave it.

36:06.167 --> 36:07.500
Does Gem's dad know?

36:07.533 --> 36:08.700
- I don't know.

36:12.733 --> 36:15.033
- What were you doing round
there in the first place?

36:15.067 --> 36:17.400
You shouldn't have
even been there.

36:34.733 --> 36:36.567
Setting up nice.

36:38.700 --> 36:40.700
All this snow
and shit, man.

36:45.600 --> 36:47.433
There's the boy Jermaine.

36:49.867 --> 36:51.300
- Yo, Rafe.

36:52.833 --> 36:54.300
Yeah.

36:54.333 --> 36:56.533
Yeah, he's safe, man, he's cool.

36:56.567 --> 36:58.333
All right.
- Yo, Sully.

36:58.367 --> 36:59.567
- Come, man.

37:15.567 --> 37:17.600
Fam, what the fuck
happened to you, blood?

37:17.633 --> 37:20.033
- What the fuck does it look
like, blood?

37:20.067 --> 37:22.200
- Beat down.

37:22.233 --> 37:23.833
- You know what I'm saying.
Where's Rafe, blood?

37:23.867 --> 37:25.533
- He's on his way, man.

37:25.567 --> 37:28.267
You know what, give him that
when you see him, yeah?

37:28.300 --> 37:29.300
Come on.

37:45.367 --> 37:46.433
You hungry?

37:46.467 --> 37:47.733
- No.

37:47.767 --> 37:49.833
- Oh. I thought you must want
something to eat.

37:49.867 --> 37:52.367
- No, I just came to
see you, innit?

37:54.300 --> 37:55.300
- Come.

38:00.433 --> 38:01.533
- Thank you.

38:02.600 --> 38:03.833
- Hi.
Hi.

38:03.867 --> 38:07.133
Can I have a portion
of chips, please?

38:07.167 --> 38:09.467
How's...
How's your friend?

38:09.500 --> 38:11.500
You had an argument?

38:15.233 --> 38:16.733
That's a pound.

38:16.767 --> 38:17.800
- Thank you.

38:17.833 --> 38:21.100
- Remember that time you got
that email from Mum?

38:21.133 --> 38:22.133
- Uh-huh.

38:25.200 --> 38:29.567
- When a woman leaves her
husband, it's a bad thing, Gem.

38:29.600 --> 38:32.100
When a woman leaves her child...

38:34.133 --> 38:36.467
that woman's a bad woman.

38:36.500 --> 38:39.500
Forget about her. She doesn't
care about us.

38:40.533 --> 38:41.533
Hi.

39:22.800 --> 39:26.200
- They don't want me.

39:26.233 --> 39:27.533
Who?

39:27.567 --> 39:30.400
- The youth squad. Say
I'm not good enough.

39:34.500 --> 39:37.033
- Look, you'll get in next time.

39:37.067 --> 39:39.200
I know it.

39:40.700 --> 39:43.100
Why are you saying that?

39:43.133 --> 39:44.800
You don't know anything.

40:03.533 --> 40:05.533
Do you want me to go?

40:06.400 --> 40:07.400
- No.

40:07.867 --> 40:09.700
It's nice having you here.

40:17.167 --> 40:18.167
- Grab an apron.

40:21.200 --> 40:22.333
Come here.

40:26.067 --> 40:30.500
So you only half-fry these the
first time, yeah?

40:33.300 --> 40:35.300
- Yeah, this place is done.

40:35.333 --> 40:37.333
For people like us, anyway.

40:41.767 --> 40:42.767
- Kent.

40:49.100 --> 40:51.100
- I think we should go.

40:52.667 --> 40:53.667
- OK.

41:02.467 --> 41:05.033
I reckon they're
keeping it in there.

41:05.067 --> 41:09.133
- Yeah. That means grabbing one
of 'em and making 'em talk.

41:09.167 --> 41:11.667
- It's not like we ain't
done that before.

41:13.767 --> 41:16.267
- Yeah, we did.

41:20.167 --> 41:21.400
- When we made Kamale

41:21.433 --> 41:23.500
think we was gonna bury
him alive and that.

41:25.333 --> 41:27.400
- You know what, you're fucked
for coming up with that.

41:27.433 --> 41:30.767
- That weren't even me, though.
That was fucking you.

41:32.700 --> 41:36.600
All I know is, when you
get dug up,

41:36.633 --> 41:38.567
you're gonna tell a man
everything he wants to hear,

41:38.600 --> 41:42.033
cos I know you don't wanna
get buried again.

41:42.067 --> 41:44.800
- So what you saying, you're
gonna bury them in there?

41:44.833 --> 41:47.667
You gonna bring a fucking JCB
with you or something?

41:50.167 --> 41:52.733
- I'm gonna make them
talk, trust me.

41:52.767 --> 41:55.433
- I trust you, fam.

41:56.700 --> 41:58.467
- As soon as this Kamale thing's
gone away, bruv,

41:58.500 --> 42:02.000
and we ain't waiting for feds to
kick down the fucking door.

42:03.100 --> 42:04.600
You know what I'm saying?

42:04.633 --> 42:06.833
If this goes to plan, yeah,

42:06.867 --> 42:10.500
we're gonna split the
shipment, 50/50.

42:10.533 --> 42:13.667
- What's Joe gonna
say about that?

42:13.700 --> 42:16.433
- Joe ain't gonna say nothing.

42:16.467 --> 42:18.300
He's dead.

42:23.533 --> 42:25.600
Know what I'm saying?
We can split it, innit?

42:25.633 --> 42:27.700
Or we just put it in
together again, fam.

42:27.733 --> 42:32.133
Run Summerhouse like we used to.

42:32.167 --> 42:36.533
We made a good team.

42:36.567 --> 42:38.500
My client has told
you repeatedly

42:38.533 --> 42:41.467
she cannot help you with your
inquiries into this matter.

42:41.500 --> 42:42.733
Now move on.

42:42.767 --> 42:45.033
Well I don't believe
your client's telling the truth.

42:45.067 --> 42:46.400
- I've fucking had enough.

42:46.433 --> 42:47.400
- All right, Kayla, just...

42:47.433 --> 42:49.133
- Come out my way.
- Just calm yourself down.

42:49.167 --> 42:49.933
- Come out my way.
- Sit down, please.

42:49.967 --> 42:51.433
- I said come out
my fucking way.

42:51.467 --> 42:52.567
You can't stop me.
- Kayla.

42:52.600 --> 42:54.067
- I'm not under arrest!

42:54.100 --> 42:55.467
- I'm afraid that's about
to change.

42:55.500 --> 42:57.533
This interview is now
terminated.

42:57.567 --> 42:59.400
I'm arresting you on
suspicion of murder.

43:01.600 --> 43:04.833
- I ain't fucking murdered
no one.

43:04.867 --> 43:05.767
You're lying.

43:05.800 --> 43:07.767
You're fucking lying, you
fucking lesbian.

43:07.800 --> 43:09.467
- Get the custody officer.
- You fucking bitch.

43:09.500 --> 43:11.200
I've got a son.

43:11.233 --> 43:12.400
The family
liaison officer will be in

43:12.433 --> 43:13.367
to talk to you about your son.
I want to see my

43:13.400 --> 43:14.500
little boy.
This interview is

43:14.533 --> 43:16.033
now terminated.

43:16.067 --> 43:17.400
- Come off me, man!

43:17.433 --> 43:18.567
Hold on.

43:18.600 --> 43:20.400
I do not accept that you've
shown sufficient evidence

43:20.433 --> 43:21.800
to arrest my client.

43:21.833 --> 43:23.700
- We have a witness.

43:24.900 --> 43:27.467
- I'm not prepared to reveal
the identity at this time.

43:27.500 --> 43:29.833
- Does this witness
implicate my client?

43:29.867 --> 43:31.200
- The witness saw Kamale go

43:31.233 --> 43:33.267
into Kayla's house the
night he disappeared

43:33.300 --> 43:34.367
and that shortly after,

43:34.400 --> 43:37.233
Dushane, Sully and Dris arrived.

43:43.800 --> 43:46.633
- Kayla's been arrested on
suspicion of murder.

43:47.700 --> 43:49.333
Hello.

43:49.367 --> 43:52.067
- Well, this is cozy.
Does she live here?

43:52.100 --> 43:53.367
- She don't.
- Yeah, I do.

43:53.400 --> 43:54.733
- You don't.

43:54.767 --> 43:58.133
- I don't give a fuck.
They have a witness.

43:58.167 --> 43:59.567
Who?

43:59.600 --> 44:01.467
- Well, she seems nice.

44:01.500 --> 44:04.267
- They can't reveal his or her
identity, but the witness saw

44:04.300 --> 44:06.367
Kamale enter Kayla's flat

44:06.400 --> 44:11.067
and you enter shortly afterwards
with two others.

44:11.100 --> 44:12.800
They're gonna question Kayla
tomorrow again.

44:12.833 --> 44:14.767
- Yes, I will be there.

44:14.800 --> 44:16.700
I don't have a choice, do I?

44:16.733 --> 44:17.533
- I'm gonna get my coat.

44:17.567 --> 44:19.200
I'll come with you.
- Don't bother.

44:19.233 --> 44:21.067
I said don't bother.

44:27.200 --> 44:28.400
- I thought that was supposed to
be your solicitor.

44:28.433 --> 44:29.500
- It is.

44:30.533 --> 44:32.533
And what does she mean,
a witness?

44:34.100 --> 44:35.767
A witness to what?

45:03.833 --> 45:06.133
Sully, you know.
You know me.

45:06.167 --> 45:07.667
I don't give a fuck.

45:11.467 --> 45:13.133
So what's our next move?

45:15.200 --> 45:17.200
- I don't fucking know, Mike.

45:17.633 --> 45:19.300
- Ain't got time for all that.

45:19.333 --> 45:21.667
Sitting about in fucking
clubs and that.

45:21.700 --> 45:23.033
I ain't got time for that, Sul.

45:23.067 --> 45:26.633
Listen. Now, it's about you and
me now, right?

45:26.667 --> 45:29.100
I'm telling you, we can do this,
we can take them.

45:29.133 --> 45:30.700
I don't give a fuck

45:32.433 --> 45:34.267
What the fuck you gonna
do with that?

45:39.233 --> 45:40.567
- Laters, cuz.

45:46.233 --> 45:47.233
- Fuck.

45:57.233 --> 45:59.067
They're pure evil.
