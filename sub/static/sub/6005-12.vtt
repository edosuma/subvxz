03:12.458 --> 03:15.026
Well, what's up?

03:15.027 --> 03:16.227
Where are you?

03:16.228 --> 03:18.963
Well, I...

03:18.964 --> 03:20.365
I'm in L.A.

03:22.034 --> 03:23.301
When you get here?

03:23.302 --> 03:26.003

03:34.246 --> 03:37.048

04:28.200 --> 04:31.335
How much time?

04:31.336 --> 04:35.206
7:15.

04:35.207 --> 04:37.608
Oh, to fuck me.

04:37.609 --> 04:41.179
That is a bit
intense last night.

04:43.148 --> 04:44.248
You are rude.

04:44.249 --> 04:46.083
Mobile

04:54.927 --> 04:57.061
Stop.

04:58.597 --> 05:00.531
Reggie:
I had everything.

05:00.532 --> 05:02.266
The boys and me running wild.

05:02.267 --> 05:06.204
Hot dog hanging our asses.

05:06.205 --> 05:08.206
We had all toys--

05:08.207 --> 05:11.475
Boats, big ass F-250s.

05:11.476 --> 05:12.643
This is the high desert town of prison,

05:12.644 --> 05:18.282
So our correction officers
we started the show.

05:18.283 --> 05:22.153
A woman?
Mmm.

05:22.154 --> 05:23.988
You can not believe it.

05:26.258 --> 05:29.160
What we can not believe the women?

05:29.161 --> 05:31.929
I'm just saying that there were many.

05:31.930 --> 05:32.830
Oh.

05:32.831 --> 05:37.201
You screw them all, Reggie,
or what?

05:37.202 --> 05:39.203
Tell us.

05:39.204 --> 05:41.138
How many were there?

05:41.139 --> 05:42.139
A lot.

05:42.140 --> 05:43.307
Oh.

05:43.308 --> 05:44.408
Give me a number.

05:44.409 --> 05:47.878
Jason, you can close it?

05:47.879 --> 05:49.413
Good.

05:49.414 --> 05:54.385
Uh, uh, Christina
Reggie has the floor.

05:54.386 --> 05:55.553
Let's--
Let's let him finish.

05:55.554 --> 05:58.589
Yes, I'm just wondering,
where he was going with all this?

05:58.590 --> 06:02.026
I mean, he was just talking about their boats

06:02.027 --> 06:03.594
And I think his penis.

06:03.595 --> 06:06.097
This is what "hot dog
hanging ass" means,

06:06.098 --> 06:08.065
Your little dick hanging?

06:08.066 --> 06:08.899
Matt.

06:08.900 --> 06:12.069
You talk down to everyone, Reggie.

06:12.070 --> 06:13.571
We're all sick of it.

06:13.572 --> 06:15.473
I'm telling you where I come from.

06:15.474 --> 06:18.242
We know where you came from.
You tell us each group.

06:18.243 --> 06:20.278
Why do not you talk about so high,

06:20.279 --> 06:22.213
You left her daughter in the car

06:22.214 --> 06:24.216
Or when you have specified a gun to your wife?

06:30.322 --> 06:32.356
We're all here.

06:32.357 --> 06:36.995
So U-time use
, to help each other.

fucking grass.

10:50.548 --> 10:52.249
Well, with the accident as it is,

10:52.250 --> 10:53.384
It's going to be a long day, sir.

No one called me.

11:08.466 --> 11:09.500
Well, John did not know.

11:09.501 --> 11:10.634
I didn't-- I did not say anything
Juan.

They tell you that on the first day.

13:01.246 --> 13:02.312

16:20.378 --> 16:22.412
Whatever.
I do not want to talk about it.

16:22.413 --> 16:23.447
Uh, I am old.

16:23.448 --> 16:27.952
Shut up.

16:29.187 --> 16:31.189
When you begin to use the surname
mom?

16:32.023 --> 16:33.991
A couple of years ago.

16:42.100 --> 16:43.367
Hello.

16:45.403 --> 16:46.470
You must have a sister.

16:46.471 --> 16:50.040
She is my sister.
I'm Ava.

16:50.041 --> 16:51.441
Um.

16:51.442 --> 16:53.577
I am a Jay Kulina.

16:53.578 --> 16:56.280
I assumed that Alicia was pretty
,

16:56.281 --> 17:00.250
But it is clear that it is damn neck and neck.

17:01.386 --> 17:04.122
Well, we have something for everyone.

17:06.424 --> 17:08.125
Guess who's older.

17:08.126 --> 17:09.126
I would never.

17:09.127 --> 17:10.359
Oh, come on.
Guess.

17:10.361 --> 17:12.229
About, Ava, come on.
Guess.

17:15.967 --> 17:17.099
You want to play?

17:24.409 --> 17:25.442
Alicia younger.

17:25.443 --> 17:28.045
- Oh, that's--
- Oh, I love you so much.

17:28.046 --> 17:29.246
- Uh?
- Wow.

17:29.247 --> 17:30.314
I am a year older.

17:30.315 --> 17:33.016
It's been suggested is true.

17:33.017 --> 17:34.918
You are both stunning.

17:34.919 --> 17:35.986
Ava...

17:35.987 --> 17:38.021
'Twas fun.

17:38.022 --> 17:39.256
We love your younger sister,

17:39.257 --> 17:42.159
And I think we take
great care of her.

17:42.160 --> 17:44.561
According to your people, Adios.

17:44.562 --> 17:47.230
You better.

17:47.231 --> 17:49.266
Hey, let's go out tonight.

17:49.267 --> 17:51.001
Do you want to?
Come on.

17:51.002 --> 17:52.102
Yes.

17:52.103 --> 17:53.337
Yes!
Let's do it.

17:55.373 --> 17:58.042
Matt.

17:59.644 --> 18:02.412
Dr. Amber: You're lucky.
MPC intact.

18:02.413 --> 18:04.348
Do you have class one tear--
without surgery.

18:04.349 --> 18:05.882
Do heal on its own.

18:05.883 --> 18:07.017
Can he fight?

18:07.018 --> 18:08.151
How far?

18:08.152 --> 18:09.119
10 days.

18:09.120 --> 18:11.355
This is a difficult question.

18:11.356 --> 18:13.223
It's hard to know.

18:13.224 --> 18:14.591
You have to let pain be your guide.

18:14.592 --> 18:17.194
If you can handle it, go.
If it hurts, back off.

18:17.195 --> 18:19.930
Great.
Thanks.

18:19.931 --> 18:21.131
You got it.

18:21.132 --> 18:22.566
How to Nate?
He is better.

18:22.567 --> 18:24.368
He still owes me
follow-up.

18:24.369 --> 18:26.403
I will make sure that happens.
You are better.

18:26.404 --> 18:28.338
Thanks for getting this guy.
Anytime.

18:28.339 --> 18:30.207
Well,
I will speak with you soon.
Good luck.

18:30.208 --> 18:33.143
What do you like to do?

18:33.144 --> 18:34.111
What do you mean?

18:34.112 --> 18:35.278
I'm not going to leave the battlefield.

18:35.279 --> 18:36.480
That's what you're saying?

18:36.481 --> 18:38.515
Yes.
Well. Good.

18:38.516 --> 18:39.649
Well, stay with him today.

18:39.650 --> 18:41.418
We'll see how he feels tomorrow,

18:41.419 --> 18:42.753
And then we take it from there.

18:42.754 --> 18:45.489
I do not want someone to
fucking I know how bad it is.

18:45.490 --> 18:46.590
How to damn bad?

18:46.591 --> 18:49.025
Ryan, Ryan, how bad is it, man?

18:49.026 --> 18:50.093
Can you fight or not?

18:50.094 --> 18:50.894
Yes, I can fight.

18:50.895 --> 18:52.596
I'm just saying, as--
, Papa Jay,

18:52.597 --> 18:55.165
I hope you can respect his position
as my coach, too.

18:55.166 --> 18:56.266
"As Dad Jay"?
Indeed?

18:56.267 --> 18:57.434
What to fuck does it
supposed to mean?

18:57.435 --> 18:59.336
Do you think I'm going to tell
guy you're fighting

18:59.337 --> 19:00.337
About fucking your injury?

19:00.338 --> 19:01.405
I'm fucking hope not.
Oh really?

19:01.406 --> 19:03.473
No disrespect.
I'm just making sure.

19:03.474 --> 19:05.308
A lot of disrespect.
A lot of.

19:05.309 --> 19:06.443
I just want to be sure.

19:06.444 --> 19:09.313

20:35.066 --> 20:37.234

21:58.416 --> 22:00.417
You have been on another planet for the entire day.

22:03.187 --> 22:05.255
Ryan is my friend.

22:05.256 --> 22:07.223
I do not like to fight with my friends.

22:07.224 --> 22:08.325
I do not.

22:08.326 --> 22:13.230
Yes, but I thought you wanted.

I thought you had a curfew.

22:43.361 --> 22:45.895
Well, I get special privileges.

22:45.896 --> 22:47.197
Why?

22:47.198 --> 22:48.365
I am a model resident.

22:51.369 --> 22:52.569
I want to try, all right?

22:52.570 --> 22:54.537
They can not afford me,
they could not say yes,

22:54.538 --> 22:57.274
But at least I'm going to ask.

22:57.275 --> 22:59.342
Come on.
Two, two, two more.

22:59.343 --> 23:02.279
Press. One.

23:02.280 --> 23:03.313
Good, good, good, good.

23:03.314 --> 23:05.282
Push him. Pop it. Come on.

23:05.283 --> 23:07.984
Come on, come on, come on.
Nice.

23:07.985 --> 23:09.953
Good work.

23:09.954 --> 23:10.954
How do you feel?

23:10.955 --> 23:12.323
Good.

23:14.258 --> 23:16.259
Doc dying to see you for follow-up
.

23:16.260 --> 23:19.262
I'll give him a call.

23:19.263 --> 23:22.032
If he clears me, I want to fight.

23:22.033 --> 23:24.101
See what he says.

23:26.470 --> 23:29.239
If he clears you,
we will get you a fight.

23:29.240 --> 23:31.207
If this is what you want.

23:31.208 --> 23:34.210
I will not stand in your way.

23:34.211 --> 23:35.378
When you talk to Amber?

23:35.379 --> 23:36.613
This morning.

23:36.614 --> 23:39.350
What he said about Ryan's knee?

23:40.985 --> 23:43.153
It's wonderful.

23:43.154 --> 23:44.320
Is he going to fight?

23:44.321 --> 23:47.358
Yes, he will fight.
Stop asking me questions.

23:48.426 --> 23:50.527
What happened to Ryan knee, anyway?

23:50.528 --> 23:51.561
No matter what he said happened.

23:51.562 --> 23:54.297
"Whatever he said, it happened."
Of course.

23:54.298 --> 23:56.266
Let's go. Give me 10.

23:56.267 --> 23:57.334
Ready?

23:57.335 --> 23:58.535
You do not wear a dress?

23:58.536 --> 24:00.403
I do not like any of my own.

24:00.404 --> 24:01.504
Well, I got a couple in the car.

24:01.505 --> 24:03.340
How will I
suits your shit.

24:03.341 --> 24:05.042
You could.

24:05.643 --> 24:08.445
No, I like it.
I'm comfortable.

24:08.446 --> 24:10.346
I like the way it looks.

24:10.347 --> 24:13.884
You look good.
I'm just offering.

24:15.186 --> 24:17.120
Hey, we have to, um, to invite Jay.

24:17.121 --> 24:18.855
Really?

24:18.856 --> 24:20.156
Yes.

24:20.157 --> 24:22.058
I think he's funny.

24:22.059 --> 24:23.927
I love it. No?

24:23.928 --> 24:24.728
Yes.

24:24.729 --> 24:29.199
I just
I would like to talk to you.

24:29.200 --> 24:31.302
He can meet us later, then.

24:34.271 --> 24:39.142
7, 8, 9--
one more-- and 10.

24:39.143 --> 24:40.410
Good, good job.

24:40.411 --> 24:43.113
Good work.
Let you pulled.

24:43.114 --> 24:45.049
Go ahead and lay down.

24:46.050 --> 24:47.384
Bob.

24:49.253 --> 24:51.020
You are unbelievable.

24:51.021 --> 24:52.622
What?

24:52.623 --> 24:54.557
Hold my tongue
the entire session.

24:54.558 --> 24:56.326
You are not going to apologize to me?

24:56.327 --> 24:57.427
Why?

24:57.428 --> 24:58.561
I have called you eight times
train another night.

24:58.562 --> 25:00.964
Eight times I called you.
You do not pick up once.

25:00.965 --> 25:02.198
Not once.

25:02.199 --> 25:03.233
Bob, it was midnight.

25:03.234 --> 25:04.234
So what?

25:04.235 --> 25:06.402
I paid you 10 Grand,
I do not? A?

25:06.403 --> 25:08.438
I was damn clear
from what I expected from you.

25:08.439 --> 25:12.375
Be available to me.
I need you whenever I call you.

25:12.376 --> 25:14.244
Good?
Any time-- day or night.

25:14.245 --> 25:15.612
I said.
Did not I say that?

25:15.613 --> 25:17.580
I'm sorry. I did not know
that's what you mean.
Well, do me a favor.

25:17.581 --> 25:19.349
Just get the fuck out of here, okay?

25:19.350 --> 25:20.650
Please?

25:20.651 --> 25:22.552
You know, I'm trying to help you,

25:22.553 --> 25:24.554
And-- and--
and you're going to shit on me?

25:24.555 --> 25:26.689
I do not need.
I do not need.

25:26.690 --> 25:28.525
I was not shitting you, Bob.
Yes OK.

25:28.526 --> 25:31.060
Just pack your things and leave
, okay?

25:31.061 --> 25:32.162
You're a good guy, Nate.

25:32.163 --> 25:33.563
I just pay you to leave now.

25:33.564 --> 25:37.034
That is what I pay you for.
You are welcome. Go.

25:37.601 --> 25:40.336
Make your drink before you go, will I?

25:40.337 --> 25:42.873
Course.

26:28.285 --> 26:29.452
Hey.

26:29.453 --> 26:31.120
How was your son?

26:31.121 --> 26:33.156
That was nice.

26:33.157 --> 26:35.993
It is always a pleasure.

26:38.128 --> 26:41.030
What are you doing?

26:41.031 --> 26:44.902
I need to talk to you.

26:46.303 --> 26:48.137
So I was--
get wet.

26:48.138 --> 26:50.207
Sorry.

26:52.142 --> 26:53.543
Sorry.

26:53.544 --> 26:56.512
What's wrong?
I was going to go to bed.

26:56.513 --> 27:01.150
Uh, I thought about our conversation
.

27:01.151 --> 27:04.587
Uh, I was thinking about you,

27:04.588 --> 27:07.523
Who do I consider myself
more and more.

27:07.524 --> 27:10.393
I do not want to stop it with you.

27:10.394 --> 27:13.429
I think you're an incredible woman.

27:13.430 --> 27:15.131
Oh, I do not really have.

27:15.132 --> 27:17.333
You.

27:17.334 --> 27:19.068
See where you met me, Jason.

27:19.069 --> 27:20.270
I do not care.

27:20.271 --> 27:22.572
I do not care how you get here.

27:22.573 --> 27:27.144
I care about you and I want you.

27:29.213 --> 27:34.450
It's very cute, and I'm flattered,

27:34.451 --> 27:38.956
But I have a way older than you,
, and you are married.

27:39.256 --> 27:41.959
Do you have a good life.

27:43.127 --> 27:45.195
Do not bother him.

27:50.200 --> 27:51.935
Sweetie, let's not do it.

27:52.536 --> 27:56.373
No.
Get away from me!

28:14.992 --> 28:17.093
Here you go.

28:17.094 --> 28:19.262
This one freezes.

28:19.263 --> 28:21.031
Thank you.

28:22.833 --> 28:25.202
Phew.

28:28.105 --> 28:30.274
Hey, Ryan?
Yes?

28:32.276 --> 28:35.511
You want to beat him, right?

28:35.512 --> 28:38.114
It's good, man.
It's just stress.

28:38.115 --> 28:39.882
Here.

28:39.883 --> 28:42.652
Thank you.

28:42.653 --> 28:45.254
Keith: I do not like to see you hurt
.

28:45.255 --> 28:46.322
Do you want to watch a movie?

28:46.323 --> 28:50.160
Yes, the person that you want.

29:01.205 --> 29:02.372
Ryan: Keith,
what the fuck, man?

29:02.373 --> 29:03.873
We do not see it.

29:03.874 --> 29:05.341
Why not?

29:05.342 --> 29:07.310
We do not watch porn together, man.

29:07.311 --> 29:08.478
You do not do it.

29:08.479 --> 29:11.214
This is your movie, Ryan.
I thought you would like it.

29:11.215 --> 29:12.382
Good.

29:12.383 --> 29:14.550
You look at him.
Do not worry about it.

29:14.551 --> 29:16.519
I'm-- I'm--
I'm going to bed.

29:16.520 --> 29:18.287
I'm turning it off.
No no no no.

29:18.288 --> 29:20.323
You, uh--
you go ahead and watch the people.

29:20.324 --> 29:24.293
Do not worry about it.
I, uh-- I'll leave.

29:31.101 --> 29:33.036
Night.

29:35.506 --> 29:37.273
your boss.

29:42.179 --> 29:45.381
Hey.
Hey.

29:45.382 --> 29:47.250
Any news about Ryan?

29:47.251 --> 29:48.651
Well, dad took him to the ember,

29:48.652 --> 29:51.087
So whatever it was, he was going to fight.

29:52.056 --> 29:54.557
So, how much he hurt?

29:54.558 --> 29:56.459
It is not going to tell me about it.

29:58.228 --> 30:01.531
But he is going to fight, are not you?

30:01.532 --> 30:03.132
Nate:
This is what he said.

30:03.133 --> 30:05.334
Psh!

30:05.335 --> 30:08.671
Then I got nothing to worry about.

30:08.672 --> 30:13.242
Well, I'm going to be
a head for the evening.

30:13.243 --> 30:15.111
Hold my calls.

30:16.313 --> 30:18.881
How do I look?
Hm? Hmm?

30:18.882 --> 30:20.116
So good.

30:20.117 --> 30:23.219
You are not even looking at me.

30:23.220 --> 30:28.125
I like... floral shirt.
Mm. Uh-huh.

30:28.726 --> 30:32.028
Bro, you need to turn off these fucking video

30:32.029 --> 30:33.129
And to go out and play.

30:33.130 --> 30:36.065
Do you understand me?

30:36.066 --> 30:37.166
I'm serious, though.

30:37.167 --> 30:40.570
Do you know your brain is made up of
neuroplasticity.

30:40.571 --> 30:44.340
You look damn shit
long enough, it gonna--

30:44.341 --> 30:48.945
It's going back to Mr. carve
The Pathways, man.

30:48.946 --> 30:50.546
What is the science.

30:50.547 --> 30:52.448
Go outside.

30:52.449 --> 30:56.285
Nature--
videogame God.

31:09.366 --> 31:13.202
Hey, Bob.
What's happening?

31:13.203 --> 31:14.537
But I made a fucking Miami.

31:14.538 --> 31:17.406
To be honest, it's just porn
Eurotrash and at this point,

31:17.407 --> 31:19.542
Or at least, that's how I got approached
.

31:19.543 --> 31:21.177
It was bloody annoying.

31:21.178 --> 31:22.278
Have you been to Italy?

31:22.279 --> 31:25.214
Yes, I was, but it was--
it was full, too

31:25.215 --> 31:27.483
I finished firing their agency, and...

31:27.484 --> 31:30.553
I'll be here.
I'm going to take some meetings.

31:30.554 --> 31:33.322
I kinda sort of--
done.

31:33.323 --> 31:35.491
So what are you gonna do?

31:35.492 --> 31:38.027
I'll probably do some
print material can be.

31:38.028 --> 31:39.195
I do not know.

31:39.196 --> 31:43.566
I just I saved a lot of money
, so I got the pillow.

31:43.567 --> 31:47.203
But you're a heck of a fighter.
I can not believe that.

31:47.204 --> 31:48.504
Why not?

31:48.505 --> 31:51.140
Because, I mean, this is crazy.

31:51.141 --> 31:52.441
No, it's not.

31:52.442 --> 31:55.077
See, I train a lot,
to treat it like a job.

31:55.078 --> 31:56.379
That's what it is.

31:56.380 --> 31:58.347
You make any money?

31:58.348 --> 31:59.682
Not exactly.
No.

31:59.683 --> 32:02.285
But if I get better
and I keep winning fights,

32:02.286 --> 32:05.989
Then it gets better.

32:07.324 --> 32:09.325
Just fucking say.

32:09.326 --> 32:11.093
I'm not saying anything.

32:11.094 --> 32:12.328
Good.

32:12.329 --> 32:13.696
Do not.

32:13.697 --> 32:16.933
I mean, is there anything else
you need to tell me?

32:16.934 --> 32:17.700
How that?

32:17.701 --> 32:21.070
How do you eat pussy now?

32:21.071 --> 32:22.138
You fucking kidding me?

32:22.139 --> 32:24.273
Well, I'm sorry.
No. I fuck you, man.

32:24.274 --> 32:25.608
Well, I just checked.
You never know.

32:25.609 --> 32:27.944
I do not eat a fucking pussy.

32:29.079 --> 32:31.447
You fucking funny.

32:31.448 --> 32:33.015
You eat pussy?

32:33.016 --> 32:34.317
No.

32:37.554 --> 32:40.323
It's wonderful.
Beautiful Mendez sisters.

32:40.324 --> 32:42.491
Can I?
Yes.

32:42.492 --> 32:45.261
Narrator:...
German jet plane in combat,

32:45.262 --> 32:47.330
Me 262 turbojet aircraft

32:47.331 --> 32:50.199
The operation resembles a rocket.

32:50.200 --> 32:51.267
It utilizes a turbine

32:51.268 --> 32:53.269
Only for air compressor

32:53.270 --> 32:55.104
For supplying oxygen to the engine.

32:55.105 --> 32:56.372
Propulsion is provided

32:56.373 --> 32:59.141
By expansion of the gases in the combustion chamber

32:59.142 --> 33:00.309
How to rocket jet.

33:00.310 --> 33:03.346
Me 262 is a single-seat fighter-bomber
.

33:03.347 --> 33:05.047
I do not think you understand...

33:06.283 --> 33:07.550
... How big star
your sister will.

33:07.551 --> 33:09.518
Oh, whatever, man.
No difference?

33:09.519 --> 33:11.354
Yes, anything.

33:11.355 --> 33:12.655
Look at her.
Look at it.

33:12.656 --> 33:15.291
Take a good, long, hard look at
this person.

33:15.292 --> 33:17.627
She is beautiful and she can fight.

33:17.628 --> 33:19.996
I'm not saying that it can fight like
, hot chick.

33:19.997 --> 33:21.197
Yes.

33:21.198 --> 33:22.465
It can dominate a bitch.

33:22.466 --> 33:23.666
It was always like this?

33:23.667 --> 33:25.635
She was always in mind,
, but it was not always hot.

33:25.636 --> 33:27.637
Yeah.
Allie was a late bloomer.

33:27.638 --> 33:30.506
You know what, guys?
Can we just not talk about it?

33:30.507 --> 33:32.508
What? I mean, you're passionate fuck
. What's the difference?

33:32.509 --> 33:34.176
I care.
Are you kidding me?

33:34.177 --> 33:35.211
That shit was garbage.

33:35.212 --> 33:36.279
All have always loved Ava

33:36.280 --> 33:38.281
Cecause it was a small, pretty little
.

33:38.282 --> 33:39.949
It was a bodyguard.

33:39.950 --> 33:40.516
Bodyguard?

33:40.517 --> 33:41.651
What makes it better?

33:41.652 --> 33:43.853
There's a little fire
between the two of you.

33:43.854 --> 33:45.588
I like it.
Well, well, then,
fucking sit

33:45.589 --> 33:47.456
And have a drink with us.
No, ma'am.

33:47.457 --> 33:48.624
I have a battle to prepare for

33:48.625 --> 33:50.526
Against
my best friend and her boyfriend.

33:50.527 --> 33:52.161
Wait. Pal?
Yeah.

33:52.162 --> 33:53.396
It's not my boyfriend.

33:54.531 --> 33:57.600
But... you make love, do you?

33:57.601 --> 34:00.236
We fuck, yes, from time to time.

34:00.237 --> 34:01.904
Do you argue.

34:01.905 --> 34:02.738
So...

34:02.739 --> 34:04.240
Yeah.
... You are in a relationship.

34:04.241 --> 34:05.241
I agree.

34:05.242 --> 34:06.342
Yeah.
She agrees.

34:06.343 --> 34:07.343
No.

34:07.344 --> 34:08.344
He's your guy.

34:08.344 --> 34:09.645
-MNH MNH.
I am fine.

34:09.646 --> 34:14.350
I think it's fucked up that
you fight your friend.

34:14.351 --> 34:16.452
Well, how did you come to learn,

34:16.453 --> 34:18.219
This is a pretty fucked up thing.

34:18.221 --> 34:19.255
Yeah.

34:19.255 --> 34:22.224
I'm going to the toilet,

34:22.225 --> 34:25.194
And then I'm going to go home.

34:25.195 --> 34:26.462
Stay out of trouble.

34:26.463 --> 34:28.264
I'll see you tomorrow

34:28.264 --> 34:31.333
And, Ava, do not leave town without saying goodbye
.

34:31.335 --> 34:33.235
We'll see.

34:36.139 --> 34:38.040
Hey, Nate.
How do you?

34:38.041 --> 34:39.208
Hey.
Come.

34:39.208 --> 34:41.243
I'm glad to see you.
Hey.

34:41.244 --> 34:42.678
Uh, I thought you wanted
train today.

34:42.679 --> 34:47.016
Well, I did,
, but, you know, lost the desire.

34:47.016 --> 34:47.984
Yes.

34:47.985 --> 34:49.452
Well, well, I can just go back
morning.

34:49.453 --> 34:51.487
No, no, no, no.
Listen, listen, listen.

34:51.487 --> 34:53.556
Nat  primarily,

34:53.556 --> 34:56.659
I would like to apologize for my tone
morning, okay?

34:56.659 --> 34:59.228
Right or wrong, I was out of line.

34:59.229 --> 35:00.563
Well, it's all good.
All is well.

35:00.564 --> 35:02.231
Just give me a call,
, and we will do the session.

35:02.232 --> 35:03.399
No, no, no, no.
Stay.

35:03.400 --> 35:04.500
See, I have a good group of friends
here--

35:04.501 --> 35:07.269
Very good friends, old friends

35:07.270 --> 35:08.471
And you're here.

35:13.443 --> 35:15.244
Yes, you are a coach.
You look great.

35:15.245 --> 35:18.047
Hey, all.
Say hello to Nate Kulina.

35:18.048 --> 35:18.948
It is my personal trainer.

35:18.949 --> 35:21.050
It is also a professional MMA fighter,

35:21.051 --> 35:22.118
If you can believe that.

35:23.019 --> 35:24.520
What are you drinking?
What do you have?

35:24.521 --> 35:26.489
Uh, vodka or something?

35:26.490 --> 35:28.157
How about a White Russian?

35:28.158 --> 35:29.358
Course.
Okay, good.

35:29.359 --> 35:31.394
Say hello to my friends,
and I will give it to you.

35:44.307 --> 35:45.641
In one case, when militants

35:45.642 --> 35:47.543
Accompanying heavyweights deep in Germany,

35:47.544 --> 35:48.611
Luftwaffe put up

35:48.612 --> 35:51.080
One of his rare defense force

35:51.081 --> 35:52.548
Lost 208 aircraft.

35:52.549 --> 35:55.085
Here are some of the reasons.

36:15.672 --> 36:18.541
Our soldiers continue to flood the Luftwaffe.

36:18.542 --> 36:19.842
Sight boresight camera

36:19.843 --> 36:22.478
Parade is the destruction of the Nazi aircraft and equipment

Hello.

36:59.049 --> 37:00.483
Hello.

37:00.484 --> 37:03.086

37:04.354 --> 37:06.088
I do not agree.

37:06.089 --> 37:08.258
Then do not go.

37:11.127 --> 37:15.030
You must come to my fight.

41:57.480 --> 41:58.480
Hey, coach.

41:58.481 --> 42:01.350
Hey.
I wake you?

42:01.351 --> 42:02.418

42:02.419 --> 42:03.952
I'm just, um
I was just lying in bed.

42:03.953 --> 42:05.221
What happened?

42:07.424 --> 42:09.191
I got bad news, Ryan.

42:09.192 --> 42:10.759
Uh...

42:10.760 --> 42:12.761
Uh, I was not even sure,
, if I was to tell you or not,

42:12.762 --> 42:16.131
But I do not think it's a damn
things at the moment.

42:16.132 --> 42:17.266
What?

42:17.267 --> 42:21.036
There's a problem with the baby.

42:21.037 --> 42:22.070
We lost it.

42:22.071 --> 42:24.506
He's gone.

42:24.507 --> 42:28.043
Li-- Lisa well, though,
you know, physically.

42:28.044 --> 42:30.112
That is all I know.

42:30.113 --> 42:32.949
Alvey, I'm so sorry.

42:35.485 --> 42:37.519
I do not even know what to say.

42:37.520 --> 42:41.456
I know, and I appreciate that.

42:43.159 --> 42:44.526
In any case, I know I kn--

42:44.527 --> 42:45.661
How important is it for you,

42:45.662 --> 42:48.397
So I-I figured I
you need to know, too.

42:48.398 --> 42:51.267
Yes, yes.

42:53.136 --> 42:54.337
Thank you.

42:55.572 --> 42:59.374
Well, we obtain
after tomorrow, okay?

42:59.375 --> 43:02.077
Cool.

43:02.078 --> 43:06.114
Hey, Alvey.

43:06.115 --> 43:08.417
Yes?

43:08.418 --> 43:11.287
Do you think it would be good if
I called her?

43:17.660 --> 43:21.230
Why do not you give him a few days
, Ryan, okay?

43:21.231 --> 43:24.233
Good.

to me last night?

44:47.951 --> 44:48.951

44:48.952 --> 44:50.218
Nonsense.

44:50.219 --> 44:52.220

44:52.221 --> 44:54.222
You look like you're doing.

44:54.223 --> 44:57.093
I'm sorry.
I do not.

44:58.695 --> 45:02.098

45:13.076 --> 45:14.176
He'll be back in a month.

45:14.177 --> 45:15.510
Where to fuck it!

He's on a plane to London.
He'll be back in a month.

45:17.547 --> 45:20.215
He wanted to give it to you.

45:20.216 --> 45:21.450
This is $ 10,000
to keep you on retainer.

45:21.451 --> 45:23.352
I do not want this.

45:23.353 --> 45:25.687
Think I want the damn money?

45:25.688 --> 45:28.423
It's for a month.
You will not even see it.

45:28.424 --> 45:31.159
Just... take the money.

45:31.160 --> 45:32.394
I do not want the fucking money.

45:32.395 --> 45:34.796
I do not know where he is to fuck
,
, is why he's not here,

45:34.797 --> 45:37.299
Cecause, if it was, I would beat
fuck out of it right now.
