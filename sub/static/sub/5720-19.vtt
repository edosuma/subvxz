00:15.089 --> 00:17.248
As-salaam alaikum.

00:17.249 --> 00:20.309
<i>Wa alaikum salaam.</i>

00:23.789 --> 00:24.889
Nice, isn't it?

00:29.419 --> 00:32.058
Sharp, anyway.

00:33.209 --> 00:34.998
A gift from Jibral Disah.

00:34.999 --> 00:37.288
You've done your homework.

00:37.289 --> 00:40.248
I like that.

00:40.249 --> 00:43.088
Yeah, the caliph in Libya
sent it when we pledged

00:43.089 --> 00:47.288
our allegiance after his
glorious attack on America.

00:47.289 --> 00:49.788
Surprised they sent you.

00:49.789 --> 00:52.088
(in deep voice):
"No negotiating with terrorists"

00:52.089 --> 00:53.088
and all that.

00:53.089 --> 00:54.088
I'm not here

00:54.089 --> 00:56.019
as a U.S. official.

00:57.209 --> 00:58.588
Tonight, I bring a proposal

00:58.589 --> 01:00.639
from the government of Iraq.

01:02.629 --> 01:03.748
Go on then.

01:03.749 --> 01:05.828
They're prepared to return

01:05.829 --> 01:07.378
five of your fighters

01:07.379 --> 01:10.378
captured on the battlefield in Ramadi,

01:10.379 --> 01:13.668
in return for the 106
Nigerian schoolgirls

01:13.669 --> 01:15.099
in your captivity.

01:17.329 --> 01:18.979
It's a good offer.

01:21.709 --> 01:22.809
What's your answer?

01:29.919 --> 01:32.269
I like a practical gift.

01:36.419 --> 01:40.328
How about I send you back
with this one's head in a bag?

01:40.329 --> 01:42.538
What'd you think of

01:42.539 --> 01:44.479
that for an answer?

01:46.329 --> 01:49.878
I think such an answer

01:49.879 --> 01:52.998
would be beneath the dignity

01:52.999 --> 01:56.139
of an emir like yourself.

01:59.879 --> 02:01.349
You're a clever one, aren't you?

02:02.709 --> 02:05.588
Where you from, anyway?

02:05.589 --> 02:06.788
New York...

02:06.789 --> 02:09.038
but my parents are from Abuja,
like yours.

02:09.038 --> 02:11.378
(laughs)

02:11.379 --> 02:13.248
That's why they sent you,

02:13.249 --> 02:15.538
'cause we're both Hausa.

02:15.539 --> 02:18.479
We're gonna bond over our
immigrant experience, are we?

02:20.459 --> 02:22.708
Nah, mate.

02:22.709 --> 02:25.328
I am a king...

02:25.329 --> 02:26.599
and you're just a messenger.

02:28.209 --> 02:29.828
Give him your answer

02:29.829 --> 02:32.639
in your best schoolgirl English.

02:34.089 --> 02:36.668
My sisters and I

02:36.669 --> 02:38.588
are most happy here

02:38.589 --> 02:41.498
as wives to the glorious defenders

02:41.499 --> 02:42.918
of the one true faith.

02:42.919 --> 02:43.918
The only way

02:43.919 --> 02:45.498
we will part from our husbands

02:45.499 --> 02:47.998
is as martyrs in death.

02:47.999 --> 02:49.418
Which is what they'll be

02:49.419 --> 02:53.248
if anyone comes looking for them again.

02:53.249 --> 02:54.748
Blood...

02:54.749 --> 02:56.418
death...

02:56.419 --> 02:59.038
and cleansing fire.

02:59.039 --> 03:03.809
That is the emir's answer,
now and always.

03:06.129 --> 03:08.378
Your ranks are depleted.

03:08.379 --> 03:10.128
You need those fighters...

03:10.129 --> 03:11.788
Go, messenger,

03:11.789 --> 03:14.708
and tell them what I said...

03:14.709 --> 03:18.889
before I forget my dignity.

03:25.459 --> 03:27.475
BLAKE: <i>And at 9:00, you've got</i>

03:27.476 --> 03:29.935
Dan Hass from the Office
of Management Policy,

03:29.936 --> 03:32.855
Rightsizing, and Innovation.

03:32.856 --> 03:34.475
I wonder if he's the innovator

03:34.476 --> 03:37.456
behind the word "rightsizing."

03:39.146 --> 03:41.145
Hey, that's Jareth.

03:41.146 --> 03:42.061
Pull over, pull over.

03:42.062 --> 03:42.975
Oh, ma'am,

03:42.976 --> 03:44.435
we're already running late.

03:44.436 --> 03:45.376
Jareth!

03:45.377 --> 03:46.315
Hey.

03:46.316 --> 03:49.145
Oh, Madam Sec... Mrs...
uh, Stevie's mum.

03:49.146 --> 03:49.815
Elizabeth.

03:49.816 --> 03:51.435
Oh, good, Elizabeth.

03:51.436 --> 03:52.645
Rubicon crossed.

03:52.646 --> 03:54.349
Um... I... do you...
I'm just running late.

03:54.350 --> 03:55.185
I can see that.

03:55.186 --> 03:56.775
Can't we give you a ride?

03:56.776 --> 03:58.515
I wouldn't want to impose...

03:58.516 --> 03:59.796
Oh, just get in the car already.

03:59.797 --> 04:01.300
You're not the only one running late.

04:01.301 --> 04:02.185
Right, thank you.

04:02.186 --> 04:03.326
Of course.

04:05.936 --> 04:07.275
JARETH: <i>This is unnecessary,</i>

04:07.276 --> 04:08.355
but totally appreciated.

04:08.356 --> 04:09.796
Don't be silly. Where are you going?

04:09.797 --> 04:11.820
Uh, Metro station three
blocks up would be perfect.

04:11.821 --> 04:13.225
Great.

04:13.226 --> 04:15.645
Jareth, you cannot run around

04:15.646 --> 04:17.065
in the snow in those.

04:17.065 --> 04:18.274
Are you crazy?

04:18.276 --> 04:20.108
- They're fine.
- You'll catch pneumonia.

04:20.108 --> 04:22.515
You need a good pair of winter boots.

04:22.516 --> 04:24.725
W-what was the name, Blake,

04:24.726 --> 04:26.855
of those boots that I got
Henry for Christmas?

04:26.856 --> 04:28.994
Uh, I will double-check
and send Jareth the link.

04:28.995 --> 04:30.515
JARETH: Oh, oh...
really, that's-that's not necessary.

04:30.516 --> 04:32.356
Do yourself a favor and
do your mother a favor,

04:32.357 --> 04:33.820
and invest in a pair of these boots.

04:33.821 --> 04:35.275
Promise?

04:35.276 --> 04:36.725
Okay, I promise.

04:36.726 --> 04:38.665
Good.

04:39.234 --> 04:40.065
JAY: <i>Chris,</i>

04:40.066 --> 04:41.935
you're one of the few
Westerners to meet

04:41.936 --> 04:45.645
Hadi Bangote face-to-face
and live to tell the tale.

04:45.646 --> 04:47.645
Did you learn anything about him

04:47.646 --> 04:49.065
that you think could be useful?

04:49.066 --> 04:52.065
Well... he's got a huge ego,
that's for sure.

04:52.066 --> 04:53.515
Loved being called the emir.

04:53.516 --> 04:55.725
Other than that,

04:55.726 --> 04:59.395
he's as close to pure
evil as I've ever seen.

04:59.396 --> 05:01.355
So, your opinion is that Boko Haram

05:01.356 --> 05:03.895
is opposed to any further
attempts at negotiation

05:03.896 --> 05:05.105
to get the girls back?

05:05.106 --> 05:06.275
Oh, violently opposed.

05:06.276 --> 05:07.819
WOMAN: So as far as this working group

05:07.820 --> 05:09.395
is concerned, our recommendation

05:09.396 --> 05:10.939
for securing the girls' release is...?

05:10.940 --> 05:12.015
Back to the drawing board,

05:12.016 --> 05:14.275
in so many words.

05:14.276 --> 05:16.815
Folks, I know this is a setback,

05:16.816 --> 05:18.605
after all the months
of work we've put in,

05:18.606 --> 05:21.015
but let's keep thinking
outside the box.

05:21.016 --> 05:22.256
The Secretary remains committed

05:22.257 --> 05:23.480
to seeing these girls get home

05:23.481 --> 05:25.605
to their families... and, Chris,

05:25.606 --> 05:27.469
Secretary McCord wanted
me to personally convey

05:27.470 --> 05:28.790
her appreciation for your bravery

05:28.791 --> 05:30.673
- and commitment.
- We can't let them down, Jay.

05:30.674 --> 05:32.315
We're going to stay after it.

05:32.316 --> 05:34.395
We can't let them...
can't let them down.

05:34.396 --> 05:35.336
You all right?

05:35.337 --> 05:36.275
Yeah,

05:36.276 --> 05:38.395
uh, just had a headache
come on all of a sudden.

05:38.396 --> 05:39.565
Can I get you some aspirin?

05:39.566 --> 05:41.515
I just need some air... I'm...

05:41.516 --> 05:42.121
(Chris groans)

05:42.122 --> 05:42.725
Chris!

05:42.726 --> 05:43.975
Quick, call 911.

05:43.976 --> 05:46.116
Chris! Chris...

05:47.606 --> 05:48.605
JARETH: <i>Thank you again</i>

05:48.606 --> 05:49.605
for the lift.

05:49.606 --> 05:50.815
Appreciate it.

05:50.816 --> 05:51.751
Thank you.

05:51.752 --> 05:52.685
Of course.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.395
And say hi to my daughter for me

05:54.396 --> 05:56.316
- when you see her.
- Yes, absolutely, thank you.

05:56.317 --> 05:57.340
And get those boots, you!

05:57.341 --> 05:58.475
Yes, the boots!

05:58.476 --> 06:00.576
(clears throat)

06:07.186 --> 06:08.475
Too much?

06:08.476 --> 06:11.225
Did I come on too strong?

06:11.226 --> 06:12.746
(phone dings)

06:14.646 --> 06:18.685
Oh, ma'am, we can't go
to the State Department.

06:18.686 --> 06:20.065
Why, is that the White House?

06:20.066 --> 06:22.935
No, I mean, we can't go
to the State Department.

06:22.936 --> 06:24.076
It's being evacuated.

06:30.312 --> 06:33.221
Since we pinged Jibral Disah's
new wife Hijriyyah in Libya

06:33.222 --> 06:35.260
at this location several days ago,

06:35.261 --> 06:36.640
we've had a high-altitude drone

06:36.641 --> 06:38.220
surveilling the compound...

06:38.221 --> 06:42.060
but so far we've had no sign of Disah.

06:42.061 --> 06:43.180
Or Hijriyyah.

06:43.181 --> 06:44.461
Or anyone else, for that matter.

06:44.462 --> 06:45.645
What's that supposed to mean?

06:45.646 --> 06:47.470
For a compound that size,

06:47.471 --> 06:48.814
you'd expect a lot more activity,

06:48.815 --> 06:50.510
vehicles coming in and out...

06:50.511 --> 06:51.640
that sort of thing.

06:51.641 --> 06:53.260
Disah is the most wanted
terrorist in the world.

06:53.261 --> 06:54.764
We know he's gone to a lot of trouble

06:54.765 --> 06:56.140
to keep his new wife a secret.

06:56.141 --> 06:59.300
Of course, but other than
one older woman limping off

06:59.301 --> 07:01.484
to the mosque every now
and then, there's been nothing.

07:01.485 --> 07:02.510
No movement.

07:02.511 --> 07:03.600
It's hinky.

07:03.601 --> 07:04.930
And no visual I.D. on Hijriyyah?

07:04.931 --> 07:06.060
If she's in there,

07:06.061 --> 07:08.140
she has not set foot outside in a week.

07:08.141 --> 07:10.470
We're considering the possibility that

07:10.471 --> 07:14.060
perhaps SIGINT was inaccurate.

07:14.061 --> 07:16.430
Meaning what?

07:16.431 --> 07:19.600
That the wife's not there... at all?

07:19.601 --> 07:21.991
We've got nothing?

07:25.641 --> 07:27.560
Okay, guys, ask yourselves:

07:27.561 --> 07:30.510
is this the kind of report

07:30.511 --> 07:34.890
that will bring a smile to the
president's weary visage?

07:34.891 --> 07:37.930
Will he brighten and say,
"Looks like my crack team

07:37.931 --> 07:39.430
"hasn't found anything.

07:39.431 --> 07:40.970
"That's okay.

07:40.971 --> 07:42.914
- (door opens)
- I just like having them around."

07:42.915 --> 07:44.012
AIDE: Excuse me, sir.

07:48.931 --> 07:51.031
(whispering)

07:56.141 --> 07:59.180
All right, you get where
I'm going with this.

07:59.181 --> 08:02.640
Think of something fast,
or it's your asses.

08:02.641 --> 08:04.281
Now I've got other problems.

08:06.761 --> 08:09.060
Because he'd recently
been in West Africa,

08:09.061 --> 08:11.260
they took him to NIH in Bethesda.

08:11.261 --> 08:14.300
The doctors there spun
his blood, and he's...

08:14.301 --> 08:16.010
got Marburg virus.

08:16.011 --> 08:18.430
Oh, God.

08:18.431 --> 08:19.560
How's he doing?

08:19.561 --> 08:21.180
Well, he's got a hemorrhagic fever.

08:21.181 --> 08:22.324
How do you think he's doing?

08:22.325 --> 08:23.930
(sighs)

08:23.931 --> 08:25.220
Media's gonna be all over this.

08:25.221 --> 08:26.760
Tell me his cover's

08:26.761 --> 08:28.180
watertight.

08:28.181 --> 08:30.890
Well, officially,
he was on a USAID mission

08:30.891 --> 08:33.640
to Cameroon to explore
alternative energy sources.

08:33.640 --> 08:36.600
He visited a wind farm or
whatever to back that up, right?

08:36.601 --> 08:39.260
We can't have it getting around
who he was really meeting with.

08:39.260 --> 08:41.260
Yeah, Russell, he visited a wind farm.

08:41.260 --> 08:42.720
Meanwhile, the Truman building

08:42.721 --> 08:45.390
is being scoured by
guys in Hazmat suits,

08:45.391 --> 08:47.680
one of my best diplomats
was just admitted

08:47.681 --> 08:50.100
to a Level Four bio-containment ward,

08:50.101 --> 08:52.430
and dozens of others
were potentially exposed,

08:52.431 --> 08:55.930
including by the way,
my top policy guy, okay.

08:55.931 --> 08:58.970
So how about we put a
pin in second-guessing?

08:58.971 --> 09:01.760
Yeah, sorry.

09:01.761 --> 09:03.640
Fair enough.

09:03.641 --> 09:06.760
Damn shame about those
schoolgirls, though.

09:06.761 --> 09:10.100
I swear, if I could get my hands
on the bastards who took them...

09:10.101 --> 09:12.140
I don't get off on
watching people suffer,

09:12.141 --> 09:14.720
but those guys...

09:14.721 --> 09:16.451
I might.

09:17.391 --> 09:19.100
I know.

09:19.101 --> 09:22.600
Sorry, anyway, Director
of CDC's briefing POTUS.

09:22.601 --> 09:23.861
We better get in there.

09:24.761 --> 09:26.850
Sorry we're late, Mr. President.

09:26.851 --> 09:30.100
Dr. Rickman just caught us
up on the domestic front,

09:30.101 --> 09:31.970
but I'm guessing the
Africa part of this

09:31.971 --> 09:33.260
is gonna be the real challenge.

09:33.261 --> 09:35.470
Sir, we've learned that the area

09:35.471 --> 09:37.180
of Northern Cameroon
Mr. Santumari visited

09:37.181 --> 09:40.140
has experienced a cluster
of Marburg cases

09:40.141 --> 09:41.430
unreported till now.

09:41.431 --> 09:43.300
It's probably due to its isolation

09:43.301 --> 09:46.430
and its lack of medical infrastructure.

09:46.431 --> 09:49.510
Compounded, of course,
by Boko Haram's terror campaign.

09:49.511 --> 09:50.734
So what's being done about it?

09:50.735 --> 09:52.680
That's where things get tricky, sir.

09:52.681 --> 09:54.560
Normally, the remote
location of the outbreak

09:54.561 --> 09:55.890
would be good news.

09:55.891 --> 09:58.174
- Because it's more containable.
- Local and international

09:58.175 --> 10:00.510
health agencies could
implement protocols

10:00.511 --> 10:03.890
that would contain the outbreak.

10:03.891 --> 10:06.100
Isolate the infected,
educate the populace

10:06.101 --> 10:08.060
on how the disease is spread,
things like that?

10:08.061 --> 10:09.430
That's correct. If we could do

10:09.431 --> 10:10.970
those things, most likely the virus

10:10.971 --> 10:11.970
would burn itself out

10:11.971 --> 10:13.300
without doing too much harm.

10:13.301 --> 10:14.300
But the spoiler

10:14.301 --> 10:16.970
is Boko Haram.

10:16.971 --> 10:20.970
First of all, their name means
"Western Education Is A Sin,"

10:20.971 --> 10:23.220
which should give you
some sense of how they feel

10:23.221 --> 10:25.510
about Western medicine.

10:25.511 --> 10:27.850
They'll do their best to thwart

10:27.851 --> 10:29.720
any containment effort.

10:29.721 --> 10:31.640
Partly for ideological reasons,

10:31.641 --> 10:33.220
and partly because they hope

10:33.221 --> 10:34.600
to exploit this outbreak...

10:34.601 --> 10:37.560
to conquer more territory.

10:37.561 --> 10:38.560
So why don't we just

10:38.561 --> 10:41.060
cancel all flights from West Africa

10:41.061 --> 10:44.560
and focus our energy on keeping
more cases from getting here?

10:44.561 --> 10:47.470
Because they'll get here anyway.

10:47.471 --> 10:50.111
Sir.

10:51.681 --> 10:54.060
Marburg spreads
through the bodily fluids

10:54.061 --> 10:55.600
of people infected.

10:55.601 --> 10:57.180
In crowded situations, it can be

10:57.181 --> 10:58.640
highly communicable.

10:58.641 --> 11:01.890
If this outbreak goes unchecked,

11:01.891 --> 11:04.510
it will soon reach major
population centers

11:04.511 --> 11:07.140
like Maroua.

11:07.141 --> 11:09.560
And then it will spread
from there via highway

11:09.561 --> 11:12.401
and air links to even larger centers.

11:15.301 --> 11:16.936
21 million people live

11:16.937 --> 11:19.300
in Lagos, Nigeria, alone.

11:19.301 --> 11:20.300
If it gets there...

11:20.301 --> 11:21.300
We're talking about

11:21.301 --> 11:23.220
millions potentially exposed,

11:23.221 --> 11:24.661
and after that...

11:28.221 --> 11:29.071
It's everywhere.

11:29.971 --> 11:31.560
How deadly is Marburg, Doctor?

11:31.561 --> 11:34.180
Well, depending on other co-morbidities

11:34.181 --> 11:36.252
such as the person's
general health and access

11:36.253 --> 11:38.717
to quality medical care,
the Case Fatality Rate

11:38.718 --> 11:41.305
is between 24

11:41.874 --> 11:43.413
and 90%.

11:43.414 --> 11:46.345
The key to boosting
the odds of survival

11:46.346 --> 11:49.736
is early and intensive
medical intervention.

11:51.546 --> 11:53.505
Bess, get into it with Cameroon.

11:53.506 --> 11:55.045
Find out how to secure

11:55.046 --> 11:56.505
the necessary medical aid

11:56.506 --> 11:58.755
without capitulating to Boko Haram.

11:58.756 --> 11:59.845
Will do, sir.

11:59.846 --> 12:01.545
We've got to stop this thing

12:01.546 --> 12:02.856
while there's still time.

Aces, apparently.

13:19.414 --> 13:20.317
No symptoms.

13:20.318 --> 13:21.687
Good.

13:21.688 --> 13:23.237
Abby hanging in there?

13:23.238 --> 13:26.857
Yeah, she's a trooper, and, uh,
Chloe's napping away at home.

13:26.858 --> 13:27.897
(chuckles)

13:27.898 --> 13:29.838
God, I envy toddlers.

13:31.358 --> 13:32.987
I'm sure I'm gonna see you soon,

13:32.988 --> 13:35.447
but in the meantime,
how are you keeping busy?

13:35.448 --> 13:37.857
Besides not obsessively
surfing WebMD...

13:37.858 --> 13:39.897
'cause I'm totally not doing that...

13:39.898 --> 13:42.357
I thought I'd finally catch
up on <i>Downton Abbey.</i>

13:42.358 --> 13:45.317
Ugh, I bailed after
Matthew Crawley bit it.

13:45.318 --> 13:47.397

13:47.398 --> 13:48.527

13:53.238 --> 13:55.777
Listen, I-I got to run, Jay.

13:55.778 --> 13:57.029

14:04.858 --> 14:08.107
Oh, it'll be nothing
but mortifying stories.

14:08.108 --> 14:09.548
- Three words...
- No, please, don't.

14:09.549 --> 14:10.166
Vatican...

14:10.167 --> 14:10.991
State Dinner.

14:10.992 --> 14:12.075
They accepted my apology.

14:12.076 --> 14:12.891
Yeah, but God won't.

14:12.892 --> 14:14.301
Point is, unless you want

14:14.302 --> 14:15.891
to be embarrassed for all eternity,

14:15.892 --> 14:17.761
don't die on me, Whitman, okay?

14:17.762 --> 14:18.931

14:18.932 --> 14:20.992
I, uh... I'll do my best, ma'am.

14:26.762 --> 14:30.431
Ambassador Aissatou,
welcome to my home,

14:30.432 --> 14:31.891
and also, sorry.

14:31.892 --> 14:34.131
Please, Madam Secretary,

14:34.132 --> 14:35.931
a meeting at your private residence?

14:35.932 --> 14:38.591
I am the envy of
diplomats the world over.

14:38.592 --> 14:39.721
We want to assure you...

14:39.722 --> 14:40.761
STEVIE: Mom,

14:40.762 --> 14:42.305
I need to talk to you about something.

14:42.306 --> 14:44.289
Ambassador Aissatou,

14:44.290 --> 14:44.931
my daughter,

14:44.932 --> 14:45.931
Stevie.

14:45.932 --> 14:46.931
Pleasure to meet you.

14:46.932 --> 14:47.931
Excuse me.

14:47.932 --> 14:48.932
I'm very sorry.

14:48.933 --> 14:49.931
Don't be.

14:49.932 --> 14:52.891
Knowing how to make an
entrance is half of politics.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.051
The other half being a graceful exit.

14:55.052 --> 14:56.391
Yes.

14:56.392 --> 14:57.631
(Stevie and Elizabeth laugh)

14:57.632 --> 15:00.591
My apologies, as I was saying,
we want to assure

15:00.592 --> 15:03.261
you that the United States and
the international community

15:03.262 --> 15:05.591
stand at the ready to
help contain the outbreak

15:05.592 --> 15:07.261
in Cameroon if you'll allow us.

15:07.262 --> 15:11.091
I have my government's proxy
to entertain all offers of aid.

15:11.092 --> 15:12.431
A team from

15:12.432 --> 15:15.471
the Global Emergency Foundation
is stationed in Ghana.

15:15.472 --> 15:18.051
They're prepared to deploy
to Cameroon right away.

15:18.052 --> 15:19.931
They will be most welcome.

15:19.932 --> 15:21.681
They'll travel to the affected areas,

15:21.682 --> 15:23.681
assess the severity of the outbreak,

15:23.682 --> 15:26.931
and set up a base camp
for further operations,

15:26.932 --> 15:31.681
but they will need
robust force protection.

15:31.682 --> 15:33.891
Can your military
supply them with that?

15:33.892 --> 15:36.511
I will see to it that they have
all the troops they need.

15:36.512 --> 15:37.551
And then depending

15:37.552 --> 15:40.131
on the team's results and success,

15:40.132 --> 15:41.721
more resources will follow.

15:41.722 --> 15:43.591
Well, as time is of the essence,

15:43.592 --> 15:45.801
we have a team here with
whom you can coordinate.

15:45.802 --> 15:46.801
Of course.

15:46.802 --> 15:48.181
Won't you come with me?

15:48.182 --> 15:49.782
Thank you.

15:51.342 --> 15:52.761
(whispering): Hey, Mom.

15:52.762 --> 15:54.011
(laughing)

15:54.012 --> 15:55.511
Sorry about the interruption.

15:55.512 --> 15:57.051
Don't worry about it, it happens.

15:57.052 --> 15:59.341
What's up?

15:59.342 --> 16:02.261
Okay, so I know things
are crazy right now.

16:02.262 --> 16:04.761
Um, I mean, everyone
at school's wigging out

16:04.762 --> 16:06.681
about Marburg virus, and if...

16:06.682 --> 16:08.971
if now is not a good time,
I completely understand.

16:08.972 --> 16:10.235
We can talk about this later...

16:10.236 --> 16:11.841
Five minutes ago wasn't a good time,

16:11.842 --> 16:13.471
but now's okay.

16:13.472 --> 16:15.032
Okay, so...

16:16.132 --> 16:18.261
Oh! Did Jareth tell you

16:18.262 --> 16:21.051
that I gave him a ride this morning?

16:21.052 --> 16:24.091
Yeah, uh, he did, and a-apparently

16:24.092 --> 16:26.091
you bought him some boots?

16:26.092 --> 16:29.131
Well, after Blake texted him the link,

16:29.132 --> 16:31.551
I went on the company's site, you know,

16:31.552 --> 16:33.391
just to make sure they still had

16:33.392 --> 16:34.804
- his size and stuff.
- What?

16:34.805 --> 16:36.051
You know his size?

16:36.052 --> 16:37.051
Yeah.

16:37.052 --> 16:38.511
Blake's really good at eyeballing

16:38.512 --> 16:39.511
that kind of thing.

16:39.512 --> 16:40.721
So, they had this

16:40.722 --> 16:42.341
one-click purchase button,

16:42.342 --> 16:43.721
I was just like, bam,

16:43.722 --> 16:45.554
- right in the corner...
- Ew, Mom, I just have to stop you

16:45.555 --> 16:47.221
and tell you that this is weird.

16:47.222 --> 16:48.624
- The boy needed boots!
- Who is he,

16:48.625 --> 16:49.721
Tiny Tim?

16:49.722 --> 16:52.891
Okay, I shouldn't have
to justify being nice

16:52.892 --> 16:54.091
to your new boyfriend.

16:54.092 --> 16:55.155
We'll talk about it later.

16:55.156 --> 16:57.391
Mom, seriously. (sighs)

16:57.392 --> 16:58.891
This is weird!

16:58.892 --> 16:59.841
You're weird!

16:59.842 --> 17:01.721
(sighs)

17:01.722 --> 17:03.051
Well, time to find out

17:03.052 --> 17:05.300
how much this hunch of
yours is gonna cost us.

17:05.301 --> 17:06.631
"Us?"

17:06.632 --> 17:08.050
You're not the one who
had to wrangle a next-gen

17:08.051 --> 17:09.595
surveillance drone from the Air Force.

17:09.596 --> 17:10.431
How'd you get them

17:10.432 --> 17:11.761
to turn it over so fast, anyway?

17:11.762 --> 17:13.105
I told you, I've got an old buddy

17:13.106 --> 17:14.511
works out at Creech in Nevada.

17:14.512 --> 17:16.931
"Old buddy."

17:16.932 --> 17:18.550
Shut up.

17:18.551 --> 17:20.942
Okay, here we go.

17:21.932 --> 17:22.971
Here's the gas station

17:22.972 --> 17:24.511
where the convoy stopped six days ago.

17:24.512 --> 17:26.551
Which we noted at the time,
but didn't think much of

17:26.553 --> 17:27.972
because, again, it's a gas station.

17:27.973 --> 17:30.131
And, again, we're desperate,

17:30.132 --> 17:31.971
so let's just test Jane's theory.

17:31.972 --> 17:33.395
Go ahead with the microwave camera.

17:33.396 --> 17:35.181
Let's look underground.

17:35.182 --> 17:37.181
Okay, now pull out.

17:37.182 --> 17:38.931
Holy crap.

17:38.932 --> 17:40.801
Look at that.

17:40.802 --> 17:41.841
It's a tunnel.

17:41.842 --> 17:43.322
Nice work, Jane.

17:45.092 --> 17:47.971
Okay, great, guys, we got it.

17:47.972 --> 17:50.511
That tunnel took some
serious engineering.

17:50.512 --> 17:51.721
Between this and the SIGINT,

17:51.722 --> 17:54.431
signs point to Disah
stashing Hijriyyah in there.

17:54.432 --> 17:56.471
FELLOWS: Now, this
part's just a theory,

17:56.472 --> 17:58.551
but those trucks were
there six days ago,

17:58.552 --> 18:00.631
and maybe they do a regular resupply.

18:00.632 --> 18:03.761
Which means they
could be back any day...

18:03.762 --> 18:06.301
and if Disah is as taken with
his new bride as we think he is,

18:06.302 --> 18:08.221
there's a decent chance
he'll be with them.

18:08.222 --> 18:10.431
We need to get better
eyes on that tunnel ASAP.

18:10.432 --> 18:12.011
ASAP is a tight turnaround

18:12.012 --> 18:13.801
to scare up sources on the ground,

18:13.802 --> 18:15.301
but I'll get into it.

18:15.302 --> 18:18.282
Got any old buddies
you can ask for help?

18:20.552 --> 18:22.761
Oh.

18:22.762 --> 18:23.577
Ma'am?

18:23.578 --> 18:24.391
Yeah.

18:24.392 --> 18:25.551
We've just gotten word

18:25.552 --> 18:26.895
that the medical team has arrived

18:26.896 --> 18:28.301
at their base camp,

18:28.302 --> 18:30.511
and the Cameroonian military
is securing the perimeter.

18:30.512 --> 18:31.801
Well, that's good news.

18:31.802 --> 18:33.185
Tomorrow they'll start sending out

18:33.186 --> 18:34.591
assessment teams with armed escorts

18:34.592 --> 18:35.931
into the affected areas.

18:35.932 --> 18:37.391
Thanks, Blake.

18:37.392 --> 18:38.391
Hey.

18:38.392 --> 18:39.037
Any word

18:39.038 --> 18:40.931
on Chris Santumari's condition?

18:40.932 --> 18:43.322
No improvement.

18:45.512 --> 18:47.181
Good night, Blake.

18:47.182 --> 18:49.152
Good night, ma'am.

18:57.512 --> 18:59.511
(speaking French)

18:59.512 --> 19:00.841
This guy came in off the road.

19:00.842 --> 19:02.225
Soldiers didn't want to touch him.

19:02.226 --> 19:04.011
Says he's got nausea, vomiting, fever,

19:04.012 --> 19:05.181
rash on his chest and back.

19:05.182 --> 19:07.591
All right, let's get
him into isolation.

19:07.592 --> 19:10.341
Check a CBC, CMP, and LFT and get a set

19:10.342 --> 19:12.511
of cultures.

19:12.512 --> 19:14.612
Sir, we're here to help.

19:16.472 --> 19:18.131
He's got a bomb!

19:18.132 --> 19:19.693
- (screaming)
<i>- Allahu Akbar!</i>

19:29.718 --> 19:31.427
How many killed?

19:31.428 --> 19:34.170
Seven, and most of the survivors

19:34.171 --> 19:35.761
are now infected with Marburg.

19:35.762 --> 19:38.421
Other aid workers have lost confidence

19:38.422 --> 19:39.921
in the Cameroonian military

19:39.922 --> 19:43.631
and are now refusing to
commit more personnel

19:43.632 --> 19:45.341
until the security situation improves.

19:45.342 --> 19:47.841
Just what Boko Haram wants.

19:47.842 --> 19:53.011
You know, the Soviets tried
for years to weaponize Marburg.

19:53.012 --> 19:54.551
They appreciated

19:54.552 --> 19:55.895
its lethality, but couldn't crack

19:55.896 --> 19:58.221
the delivery system.

19:58.222 --> 19:59.761
They didn't realize that

19:59.762 --> 20:03.232
all you need is one infected
fanatic and a little C-4.

20:06.012 --> 20:08.381
Three cheers for human progress.

20:08.382 --> 20:10.051
So, what now?

20:10.052 --> 20:13.631
Try to muster up some
African Union or UN troops?

20:13.632 --> 20:14.961
No, that would take months.

20:14.962 --> 20:17.011
By then, we'd be looking
at a full-blown epidemic.

20:17.012 --> 20:18.881
So we suit up the 82nd Airborne

20:18.882 --> 20:20.301
in biohazard gear and fight

20:20.302 --> 20:22.551
the insurgency and the
disease at the same time.

20:22.552 --> 20:26.801
With all due respect, sir,
such an operation would be

20:26.802 --> 20:28.551
singularly dangerous and bloody.

20:28.552 --> 20:31.721
Not half as bloody as getting
it through Congress.

20:31.722 --> 20:33.421
Well, you two better get to work then.

20:33.422 --> 20:34.761
All right.

20:34.762 --> 20:35.921
All right.

20:35.922 --> 20:38.671
Well, unless somebody
has a better idea...

20:38.672 --> 20:39.772
that'll be all.

20:47.842 --> 20:49.921
Get a better idea...

20:49.922 --> 20:52.421
fast.

20:52.422 --> 20:54.591
BLAKE: <i>But isn't luring us
into a ground campaign</i>

20:54.592 --> 20:58.261
in remote territory exactly
what Boko Haram wants?

20:58.262 --> 21:02.051
Yes, which brings me back to
that whole "better idea" thing.

21:02.052 --> 21:04.051
MAN: ...can guarantee your safety

21:04.052 --> 21:05.091
despite fighting with us.

21:05.092 --> 21:06.301
Wait a minute.

21:06.302 --> 21:10.421
Inshallah, this disease will flush out

21:10.422 --> 21:11.217
the unbelievers.

21:11.218 --> 21:12.011
Who's this guy?

21:12.012 --> 21:13.131
From our caliphate.

21:13.132 --> 21:14.721
Where's Hadi Bangote?

21:14.722 --> 21:16.961
Normally, they set off a
firecracker and he's waving

21:16.962 --> 21:18.631
his sword all over the Internet.

21:18.632 --> 21:20.841
...struck down by the mighty hand

21:20.842 --> 21:21.632
of Allah.

21:21.633 --> 21:22.421
What?

21:22.422 --> 21:25.841
Chris Santumari's condition
has taken a turn for the worse.

21:25.842 --> 21:27.341
How much of a turn?

21:27.342 --> 21:28.421
This morning

21:28.422 --> 21:29.461
they determined he has

21:29.462 --> 21:31.671
"clinically deteriorated."

21:31.672 --> 21:33.461
They gave him the
experimental treatment.

21:33.462 --> 21:35.551
(sighs)

21:35.552 --> 21:37.461
The first human trial,

21:37.462 --> 21:39.631
so they're down to Hail Marys.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.091
Call his wife.

21:41.092 --> 21:44.801
Ask if I can pay him a visit.

21:44.802 --> 21:46.461
On behalf of the nation,

21:46.462 --> 21:48.051
I want to thank him for his service.

21:48.052 --> 21:48.887
Yes, ma'am.

21:48.888 --> 21:49.822
Take me to Bethesda.

21:54.882 --> 21:56.131
HENRY: <i>Our hypothesis</i>

21:56.132 --> 21:58.011
was that the convoy would return

21:58.012 --> 21:59.301
to resupply the house.

21:59.302 --> 22:00.511
Looks like we were right.

22:00.512 --> 22:02.761
According to Jose's
sources on the ground,

22:02.762 --> 22:04.171
several men got out of the trucks,

22:04.172 --> 22:05.631
some of them carrying supplies.

22:05.632 --> 22:07.261
They went into the gas station,

22:07.262 --> 22:09.631
but they haven't come out.

22:09.632 --> 22:11.535
Thermal imaging shows
they went into the tunnel.

22:11.536 --> 22:12.511
Any of them Disah?

22:12.512 --> 22:15.591
Yeah, before we answer that...

22:15.592 --> 22:17.051
this Marburg thing...

22:17.052 --> 22:19.362
do I need to pull my
kids out of school?

22:21.552 --> 22:24.011
What, it's so crazy that I have kids?

22:24.012 --> 22:25.221
They'll be fine.

22:25.222 --> 22:26.422
Honestly if they're your kids,

22:26.423 --> 22:28.006
Marburg is the least of their problems.

22:28.007 --> 22:29.905
FELLOWS: Anyway, one of them appeared

22:29.906 --> 22:32.251
to be the leader and matched Disah's

22:32.252 --> 22:33.304
physical description.

22:33.305 --> 22:35.208
Problem is that his face
was completely covered,

22:35.209 --> 22:37.627
so our sources on the ground
couldn't make a positive I.D.

22:37.628 --> 22:39.116
Who are these sources?

22:39.117 --> 22:40.500
One's a freebooter out of Tripoli,

22:40.501 --> 22:41.786
posing as a traveling merchant.

22:41.787 --> 22:43.666
The other one's an ex-spy from Chad.

22:43.667 --> 22:45.816
My guys have worked
with them in the past.

22:45.817 --> 22:46.627
You trust them?

22:46.628 --> 22:47.601
Hell, no.

22:47.602 --> 22:49.906
They'd probably sell out their
own mothers to make a buck,

22:49.907 --> 22:50.891
but I trust their greed.

22:50.892 --> 22:52.101
The question is,

22:52.102 --> 22:54.891
if there's a 60% chance
Disah is currently

22:54.892 --> 22:56.981
in the compound, do we drone it now,

22:56.982 --> 22:59.005
or wait for him to come out
to make a positive I.D.

22:59.006 --> 23:00.670
and risk missing a clean shot?

23:00.671 --> 23:02.315
Can we do it without killing Hijriyyah,

23:02.316 --> 23:04.561
who's most likely being
held against her will?

23:04.562 --> 23:06.231
No time to put boots on the ground

23:06.232 --> 23:08.141
and raid the compound, I guess.

23:08.142 --> 23:10.561
There's a Delta team on
an undisclosed JSOC base

23:10.562 --> 23:12.401
about two hours to the east,

23:12.402 --> 23:13.691
but by the time they spin up,

23:13.692 --> 23:15.035
Disah will probably be long gone.

23:15.036 --> 23:16.521
(sighs)

23:16.522 --> 23:19.271
Well, no sense in
going to all this trouble

23:19.272 --> 23:21.561
to kill a man only to
not be sure he's dead.

23:21.562 --> 23:24.304
Let's wait for the positive I.D.,

23:24.305 --> 23:26.311
then we'll hit the trucks.

23:26.312 --> 23:29.292
I'll consult with POTUS,
but I'm sure he'll agree.

23:30.232 --> 23:31.981
Oh, listen,

23:31.982 --> 23:35.141
I know there's a lot of
noise out there right now

23:35.142 --> 23:36.941
about the virus.

23:36.942 --> 23:41.811
I appreciate your focus
on the job at hand.

23:41.812 --> 23:43.582
Keep me posted.

23:46.352 --> 23:48.641
ELIZABETH: <i>His wife's name is Vanessa?</i>

23:48.642 --> 23:50.901
Yes, they've been together nine years.

23:50.902 --> 23:51.941
Kids?

23:51.942 --> 23:53.481
Two daughters, Aisha and Kim.

23:53.482 --> 23:54.981
And he still went.

23:54.982 --> 23:57.311
He told Jay he'd want
someone to do the same

23:57.312 --> 23:58.872
for his girls.

24:00.232 --> 24:02.024
- No interruptions, okay?
- Yes, ma'am.

24:02.025 --> 24:03.851
Mrs. Santumari?

24:03.852 --> 24:04.687
Hi.

24:04.688 --> 24:05.521
Hi.

24:05.522 --> 24:07.981
Look... it worked.

24:07.982 --> 24:09.771
The treatment... it worked.

24:09.772 --> 24:11.021
That's incredible.

24:11.022 --> 24:13.231
Two hours ago,
I was telling his parents

24:13.232 --> 24:15.731
to hurry down here because I didn't...

24:15.732 --> 24:16.955
Oh, God, where are my manners?

24:16.956 --> 24:17.811
I'm so sorry.

24:17.812 --> 24:19.641
Madam Secretary, this is Dr. Hart.

24:19.642 --> 24:20.691
It's a pleasure, ma'am.

24:20.692 --> 24:22.271
Ah, believe me,
the pleasure's all mine.

24:22.272 --> 24:23.851
Doctor, tell her what you told me.

24:23.852 --> 24:24.901
Well, his fever's down,

24:24.902 --> 24:27.101
uh, his vitals are stable.

24:27.102 --> 24:29.441
We are very optimistic.

24:29.442 --> 24:31.601
The drug that we gave Chris
works along similar lines

24:31.602 --> 24:34.191
to ZMAPP, which was
developed for Ebola.

24:34.192 --> 24:35.231
In that case,

24:35.232 --> 24:36.901
many patients were symptom-free

24:36.902 --> 24:38.691
and on their feet in a matter of days.

24:38.692 --> 24:41.691
Now, we cannot be 100% sure,

24:41.692 --> 24:44.231
but we believe that Chris
is moving in that direction.

24:44.232 --> 24:46.231
It's a miracle.

24:46.232 --> 24:47.655
Sometimes we get those around here.

24:47.656 --> 24:48.521
(laughs)

24:48.522 --> 24:50.314
- I'm very happy for you...
- Thank you.

24:50.315 --> 24:51.521
...and relieved.

24:51.522 --> 24:54.141
Listen, anything you need,
call me directly.

24:54.142 --> 24:55.271
Thank you

24:55.272 --> 24:56.311
so much.

24:56.312 --> 24:57.975
Doctor, can I speak
with you for a second?

24:57.976 --> 24:59.691
Sure.

24:59.692 --> 25:02.691
This drug could be a
complete game-changer

25:02.692 --> 25:05.141
for us in fighting the
outbreak in Cameroon.

25:05.142 --> 25:06.981
It's very promising, I agree with you.

25:06.982 --> 25:09.045
Unfortunately, it's still
in the experimental phase.

25:09.046 --> 25:11.641
W-W-Wait. (stammering)

25:11.642 --> 25:13.691
Come on, I mean, desperate times.

25:13.692 --> 25:15.851
Can't the FDA fast-track it?

25:15.852 --> 25:17.191
The key component in the drug

25:17.192 --> 25:20.311
is derived from genetically
modified tobacco plants,

25:20.312 --> 25:21.941
of which we've grown very few,

25:21.942 --> 25:24.691
so even if the FDA gave
us the go ahead today,

25:24.692 --> 25:27.691
we would still be years out
from having enough medication

25:27.692 --> 25:29.141
to turn the tide of that outbreak.

25:29.142 --> 25:30.351
How much is there?

25:30.352 --> 25:33.662
After this morning, three doses.

25:36.442 --> 25:39.021
Thank you.

25:39.022 --> 25:41.601
Hey, you're asymptomatic, right?

25:41.602 --> 25:44.231
Hello to you, too.

25:44.232 --> 25:46.731
Yeah, as of 20 minutes ago, I'm fine.

25:46.732 --> 25:48.061
So even if you

25:48.062 --> 25:49.901
had the Marburg virus,

25:49.902 --> 25:51.462
the only way I could
catch it is through

25:51.463 --> 25:53.012
the exchange of bodily fluids, right?

25:53.013 --> 25:54.811
I'm starting to feel sexually harassed.

25:54.812 --> 25:55.811
Well, don't worry,

25:55.812 --> 25:57.771
'cause you're gonna stand over there.

25:57.772 --> 25:59.141
No problem.

25:59.142 --> 26:00.765
You're braver than my lawyer,
by the way.

26:00.766 --> 26:02.776
He would only review my will by phone.

26:07.272 --> 26:08.771
That's fantastic news.

26:08.772 --> 26:10.115
Chris's wife must be so relieved.

26:10.116 --> 26:12.136
(chuckles) Yeah, she was.

26:13.442 --> 26:16.141
Selfishly, I'm kind of glad
the doctors have an ace

26:16.142 --> 26:18.622
up their sleeve, even if
there are only a few doses.

26:20.942 --> 26:23.862
Did you watch the Boko Haram video?

26:23.863 --> 26:26.401
Weird that Bangote's not in it.

26:26.402 --> 26:27.481
It is, right?

26:27.482 --> 26:29.481
Spectacular attention-getting attack,

26:29.482 --> 26:32.311
you'd think a megalomaniac like
him would take all the credit.

26:32.312 --> 26:34.412
So, what are you thinking?

26:35.642 --> 26:37.832
I'm thinking he's got Marburg.

26:40.062 --> 26:41.811
Talk about poetic justice.

26:41.812 --> 26:43.901
Well, it only makes sense.

26:43.902 --> 26:45.481
The disease is highly communicable.

26:45.482 --> 26:47.351
He's at the epicenter of the outbreak,

26:47.352 --> 26:49.601
and he's crossed paths
with at least one

26:49.602 --> 26:50.601
infected person, Chris.

26:50.602 --> 26:51.981
Let's say he's gone off the grid

26:51.982 --> 26:54.481
because he doesn't want the
world to know he's dying.

26:54.482 --> 26:55.641
He's on record as saying

26:55.642 --> 26:58.941
the, uh, pure of faith won't get sick.

26:58.942 --> 27:00.101
So he's embarrassed

27:00.102 --> 27:01.605
because it turns out science is real.

27:01.606 --> 27:02.351
So what?

27:02.352 --> 27:04.351
If he's sick, what else is he?

27:04.352 --> 27:06.952
Terrified of dying a slow,
agonizing death.

27:10.272 --> 27:13.002
I think there may be
an opportunity here.

27:15.692 --> 27:19.441
You cannot seriously
be thinking of offering

27:19.442 --> 27:21.194
- that man one of the few
- We've got to contain this outbreak.

27:21.195 --> 27:22.694
- existing doses of the cure
- We have got to have a cease-fire

27:22.695 --> 27:24.442
- you've got.
- in place with Boko Haram.

27:24.443 --> 27:25.608
You've got to be kidding me.

27:25.609 --> 27:27.577
Jay, this drug could
be our only leverage.

27:27.578 --> 27:29.441
So you'd rather give
it to a mass murderer

27:29.442 --> 27:31.811
than to any one of the decent
people who've been infected?

27:31.812 --> 27:33.915
- I understand.
- No, you don't. This thing has a 20%

27:33.916 --> 27:37.061
to 90% kill rate,
and I shook a sick man's hand.

27:37.062 --> 27:39.191
I have a wife and a
little baby girl at home,

27:39.192 --> 27:41.271
and I-I-I could spike
a fever at any time.

27:41.272 --> 27:43.295
So, if you came for my blessing,
you don't have it.

27:43.296 --> 27:45.435
Look, do what you have to do,

27:45.436 --> 27:46.499
but please don't sit there

27:46.500 --> 27:48.430
and tell me that you
understand, Elizabeth.

27:49.642 --> 27:51.412
I'm sorry, ma'am.

27:55.482 --> 27:57.582
(sighs)

27:58.642 --> 28:00.901
It's the right play.

28:00.902 --> 28:02.731
I just... my nerves are, uh...

28:02.732 --> 28:04.662
It's all right, Jay.

28:07.102 --> 28:09.191
You should pitch it to POTUS.

28:09.192 --> 28:11.502
But maybe we can talk another time?

28:14.062 --> 28:15.872
Of course.

28:26.799 --> 28:29.770
So, let me understand,
this deplorable killer...

28:30.310 --> 28:32.468
one of the worst
psychopaths of our time...

28:32.469 --> 28:34.848
has fallen deathly ill,
and you want to give him

28:34.849 --> 28:36.138
a shot to make him better?

28:36.139 --> 28:39.468
For the moment,
it's not about his morality.

28:39.469 --> 28:40.852
Well, tell that to the schoolgirls

28:40.853 --> 28:42.388
he kidnapped and enslaved.

28:42.389 --> 28:43.492
Tell that to their parents.

28:43.493 --> 28:45.598
Look, I'm not saying he's deserving.

28:45.599 --> 28:46.758
I am saying that

28:46.759 --> 28:49.008
his interests might align with ours.

28:49.009 --> 28:51.638
Wrong, our interests
align with the disease.

28:51.639 --> 28:53.928
Just let it kill him for us.

28:53.929 --> 28:56.008
Okay, then no one's in
charge of Boko Haram.

28:56.009 --> 28:57.218
They keep up their insurgency

28:57.219 --> 28:59.436
while the virus spreads unchecked

28:59.556 --> 29:01.548
all the way to America.

29:01.549 --> 29:03.598
We don't negotiate with terrorists.

29:03.599 --> 29:04.638
All due respect, sir,

29:04.639 --> 29:06.222
we've already negotiated with this guy.

29:06.223 --> 29:08.223
We were intermediaries for Iraq.

29:08.224 --> 29:10.264
Oh, that's a fig leaf.
Trying to get the girls back,

29:10.265 --> 29:11.670
that was our play, top to bottom.

29:11.671 --> 29:13.197
No matter how valid the reason,

29:13.198 --> 29:14.320
once the bad guys know

29:14.321 --> 29:15.401
that they can shake us down

29:15.402 --> 29:16.906
and get away with it, it's game over.

29:16.907 --> 29:19.817
Then our only other option is
to send in the 82nd Airborne.

29:19.818 --> 29:22.152
(scoffs) All right, fine.

29:22.153 --> 29:24.588
Say we give this monster the shot.

29:24.589 --> 29:26.218
What is to stop him

29:26.219 --> 29:28.282
from turning around and
blowing up more aid workers?

29:28.283 --> 29:29.668
We only give him half the dose.

29:29.669 --> 29:33.008
The CDC tells me that
it'll ease his symptoms

29:33.009 --> 29:35.928
and lower the viral load,
but he-he won't be cured.

29:35.929 --> 29:39.338
We withhold the second half

29:39.339 --> 29:42.649
until after all the containment
protocols are in place.

29:44.049 --> 29:45.258
Beats sending our troops

29:45.259 --> 29:48.048
to fight an insurgency in a hot zone,

29:48.049 --> 29:50.338
but it sets a bad precedent.

29:50.339 --> 29:51.928
Well, then what do we need?

29:51.929 --> 29:53.229
Another fig leaf?

29:54.169 --> 29:56.218
Say we did.

29:56.219 --> 29:57.668
Cameroon's a sovereign nation.

29:57.669 --> 30:00.968
Maybe they invite us

30:00.969 --> 30:03.718
to negotiate on their behalf.

30:03.719 --> 30:07.128
Then technically it would be Cameroon

30:07.129 --> 30:10.008
negotiating with terrorists,

30:10.009 --> 30:11.128
not us.

30:11.129 --> 30:12.668
Yeah.

30:12.669 --> 30:14.218
All right.

30:14.219 --> 30:15.319
See what they say.

30:18.339 --> 30:19.758
Hell of a world we live in.

30:19.759 --> 30:21.899
I couldn't agree with you more, sir.

30:27.379 --> 30:30.878
Make an old man happy
and tell me someone

30:30.879 --> 30:33.160
in this building is actually
gonna kill a terrorist today.

30:33.161 --> 30:34.465
Our source on the ground gave us

30:34.466 --> 30:36.428
a positive I.D. on Disah
about a minute ago.

30:36.429 --> 30:38.431
- We know which truck he's in?
- Middle one.

30:38.432 --> 30:40.529
Okay.

30:41.469 --> 30:43.048
Now we're talking.

30:43.049 --> 30:45.218
As soon as they're on the
open highway, we'll hit him.

30:45.219 --> 30:47.362
DRONE OPERATOR: Target is
approximately one minute out

30:47.363 --> 30:48.668
from engagement zone.

30:48.669 --> 30:50.468
(electronic beeping)

30:50.469 --> 30:52.048
What, w-what is that?

30:52.049 --> 30:53.218
Sir, we're intercepting

30:53.219 --> 30:54.799
a cell phone call on an open channel.

30:55.407 --> 30:56.498
_

30:56.534 --> 30:58.061
_

30:58.062 --> 30:58.718
We're blown.

30:58.719 --> 31:00.128
He just told them to get out.

31:00.129 --> 31:01.378
Then take the shot!

31:01.379 --> 31:02.659
HENRY: Russell, there are dozens

31:02.660 --> 31:04.043
of innocent people in that market.

31:04.044 --> 31:05.628
The collateral damage
would be too high.

31:05.629 --> 31:07.048
Targets are leaving vehicles.

31:07.049 --> 31:09.048
Permission to fire?

31:09.049 --> 31:12.529
Tell me that we are doing this.

31:21.509 --> 31:22.718
Damn it!

31:22.719 --> 31:23.838
Permission denied.

31:23.839 --> 31:25.008
Copy that.

31:25.009 --> 31:26.979
We've lost visual
contact on the target.

31:28.379 --> 31:29.479
JACKSON: We had him.

31:30.719 --> 31:34.609
We had the man who
dirty-bombed us in our sights!

31:38.929 --> 31:40.838
One of your sources screwed us.

31:40.839 --> 31:42.942
Next time I'll be sure to find
more reliable snitches

31:42.943 --> 31:45.468
in a failed state on 24 hours notice.

31:45.469 --> 31:47.469
It's only a matter of time
before Disah figures out

31:47.470 --> 31:49.053
Hijriyyah had
something to do with this.

31:49.054 --> 31:51.088
Hard to imagine that'll end well.

31:51.089 --> 31:53.468
So our best lead comes to nothing...

31:53.469 --> 31:56.069
and we'll get a girl killed to boot.

31:57.549 --> 31:59.609
Banner day here at the
Dalton White House.

32:02.049 --> 32:04.229
Maybe it doesn't have
to come to nothing.

32:06.299 --> 32:08.258
NADINE: <i>As you can see,
we're up and running.</i>

32:08.259 --> 32:09.258
(sighs)

32:09.259 --> 32:11.088
It's good to be back.

32:11.089 --> 32:13.258
Smells like home...

32:13.259 --> 32:16.258
and bleach.

32:16.259 --> 32:18.588
Ambassador Aissatou
is waiting in your office.

32:18.589 --> 32:20.928
Thank you.

32:20.929 --> 32:23.428
Got anything to cheer me
up before what I'm sure

32:23.429 --> 32:26.378
will prove to be a very
difficult conversation?

32:26.379 --> 32:29.128
As a matter of fact...

32:29.129 --> 32:32.338
Hey, they look great,

32:32.339 --> 32:34.928
and nice work on the sizing.

32:34.929 --> 32:37.928
I don't know why Stevie
thinks this is weird.

32:37.929 --> 32:38.928
Me either, ma'am.

32:38.929 --> 32:41.689
I can feel your sarcasm behind my back.

32:43.169 --> 32:45.798
Cameroonian doctors
have contracted Marburg

32:45.799 --> 32:48.088
after rushing to the aid
of their Western colleagues

32:48.089 --> 32:50.008
wounded in the suicide attack.

32:50.009 --> 32:52.572
Nuns have fallen ill running clinics

32:52.573 --> 32:55.298
because there is no one else to do it.

32:55.299 --> 32:58.378
Saints on this Earth are dying

32:58.379 --> 33:02.094
and you would give the cure
to the very devil himself.

33:02.095 --> 33:03.696
And in doing so,

33:03.697 --> 33:05.474
I hope to save thousands,

33:05.475 --> 33:07.684
tens of thousands of lives.

33:07.685 --> 33:10.514
"Hope" being the operative word.

33:10.515 --> 33:12.365
Isn't it always?

33:14.935 --> 33:18.054
Mr. Ambassador,
I know you hate this plan.

33:18.055 --> 33:20.365
So does everybody else, believe me...

33:23.055 --> 33:25.304
but do I have your
government's permission

33:25.305 --> 33:28.894
to attempt negotiation on your behalf?

33:28.895 --> 33:33.224
The few remaining doses
will be given to Westerners,

33:33.225 --> 33:34.098
no doubt?

33:34.099 --> 33:35.135
Don't bother to answer,

33:35.136 --> 33:36.995
Madam Secretary.

33:39.475 --> 33:43.285
We both know how this game is played.

33:44.935 --> 33:47.474
Yes.

33:47.475 --> 33:49.554
For the greater good,

33:49.555 --> 33:52.724
on behalf of the
government of Cameroon,

33:52.725 --> 33:54.695
you have my permission...

33:57.185 --> 33:59.187
- (knocking)
- ...and we thank you for your effort.

33:59.188 --> 34:00.554
(door opens)

34:00.555 --> 34:03.974
Ma'am, I have Chris
Santumari on line one.

34:03.975 --> 34:05.445
(sighs)

34:06.845 --> 34:10.094
Now if you can believe it,

34:10.094 --> 34:14.034
I have an equally big favor
to ask of somebody else.

34:15.554 --> 34:16.868
<i>This is hello</i>

34:16.869 --> 34:20.589
and good night because Mama is tired.

34:20.685 --> 34:22.264
Hey, Jareth!

34:22.264 --> 34:24.995
Check it out, boot buddies.

34:25.935 --> 34:27.934
So fun.

34:27.935 --> 34:30.103
Mother, uh, a word?

34:30.105 --> 34:31.063
Okay.

34:31.063 --> 34:32.186
Hey, baby.

34:32.187 --> 34:33.417
Hi.

34:33.594 --> 34:35.184
(chuckles)

34:35.185 --> 34:37.824
HENRY: You've never thrown a football?

34:40.014 --> 34:41.054
(whispering): What's up?

34:41.054 --> 34:43.134
(whispering): Okay...

34:43.135 --> 34:44.724
you guys have got to stop.

34:44.725 --> 34:48.465
What, making Jareth feel welcome?

34:48.466 --> 34:49.353
Stalking him.

34:49.353 --> 34:51.532
Dad's going full
<i>Single White Female </i> in there.

34:51.533 --> 34:52.587
Oh, come on, stop it.

34:52.588 --> 34:53.273
He's not.

34:53.274 --> 34:53.956
What is going on?

34:53.958 --> 34:55.318
You guys have never acted this way

34:55.319 --> 34:56.621
with any of my other boyfriends.

34:56.623 --> 34:57.417
We've never liked

34:57.418 --> 34:59.207
any of your other boyfriends.

34:59.208 --> 35:01.707
Oh, my God, Mom, is that true?

35:01.708 --> 35:02.648
Kind of.

35:02.649 --> 35:03.587
Obviously,

35:03.588 --> 35:04.571
Harrison wasn't great...

35:04.572 --> 35:05.207
No.

35:05.208 --> 35:06.707
...but Arthur was nice.

35:06.708 --> 35:08.547
Nice and old.

35:08.548 --> 35:10.051
What about Mike from the tenth grade?

35:10.052 --> 35:10.877
Let's go way back.

35:10.878 --> 35:13.061
You guys were always
encouraging me to invite him over.

35:13.062 --> 35:14.667
To keep an eye on the little perv.

35:14.668 --> 35:15.837
So, what,

35:15.838 --> 35:19.547
you guys think I have
bad judgment about guys?

35:19.548 --> 35:22.207
(stammers)

35:22.208 --> 35:23.848
I think you're young.

35:26.498 --> 35:28.547
We want this to work, Stevie,

35:28.548 --> 35:31.417
because we want you to be
with someone who deserves you,

35:31.418 --> 35:32.457
that's all.

35:32.458 --> 35:34.587
And the good news is,

35:34.588 --> 35:36.877
there is a terrific
guy in that kitchen,

35:36.878 --> 35:38.188
and he's crazy about you.

35:39.128 --> 35:40.337
You think?

35:40.338 --> 35:43.287
No, Dad and I just
like acting like idiots.

35:43.288 --> 35:45.438
(laughs) Fine.

35:47.498 --> 35:48.917
The boots were too much, right?

35:48.918 --> 35:50.207
Kind of.

35:50.208 --> 35:52.417
Yeah, I see that now.

35:52.418 --> 35:53.547
I'm sorry.

35:53.548 --> 35:54.848
It's okay.

35:56.418 --> 35:58.312
Okay, I'm gonna cool my jets.

35:58.313 --> 35:58.917
I'll tell Dad

35:58.918 --> 35:59.917
to do the same.

35:59.918 --> 36:01.877
I'm glad that you like him.

36:01.878 --> 36:02.858
Yeah.

36:02.859 --> 36:03.837
And despite your opinion

36:03.838 --> 36:06.337
of my track record, I got this.

36:06.338 --> 36:08.047
Of course, you do.

36:08.048 --> 36:09.417
Put your fingers on
the laces like this...

36:09.418 --> 36:11.088
- On the laces.
- and then just give it a little snap

36:11.089 --> 36:12.192
with your wrist at the end.

36:12.193 --> 36:13.587
Dad, come on, I'm open.

36:13.588 --> 36:15.028
Oh, my God, Jason, could you be more

36:15.029 --> 36:16.252
<i>Death of a Salesman </i> right now?

36:16.253 --> 36:17.707
Uh, Henry.

36:17.708 --> 36:18.787
HENRY: Baby, get this,

36:18.788 --> 36:21.337
Jareth has never thrown a football.

36:21.338 --> 36:22.063
Really, huh?

36:22.064 --> 36:22.787
I was thinking

36:22.788 --> 36:24.287
we'd go to the park and...

36:24.288 --> 36:26.087
or it's too late for that.

36:26.088 --> 36:27.127
You think?

36:27.128 --> 36:28.287
Good night, everyone.

36:28.288 --> 36:29.287
Good night.

36:29.288 --> 36:30.287
Good night.

36:30.288 --> 36:31.671
Thanks for the lesson, Dr. McCord.

36:31.672 --> 36:32.827
Oh, hey, call me Henry, pal.

36:32.828 --> 36:34.648
(whispering): What's happening to us?

36:35.588 --> 36:37.558
They're here.

36:39.588 --> 36:40.627
No guns.

36:40.628 --> 36:42.478
(speaking French)

36:49.128 --> 36:50.558
How we feeling, Hadi?

36:51.838 --> 36:52.837
A few days ago,

36:52.838 --> 36:54.667
I was where you are now...

36:54.668 --> 36:56.667
then they gave me the cure.

36:56.668 --> 36:58.337
Now I'm immune.

36:58.338 --> 37:00.337
I'm not afraid to die.

37:00.338 --> 37:01.457
Of course not.

37:01.458 --> 37:04.058
You're the emir.

37:08.048 --> 37:09.127
Give us the shot.

37:09.128 --> 37:10.667
Give us your word

37:10.668 --> 37:13.207
the aid workers will be safe.

37:13.208 --> 37:15.207
I'll hold up my end of the deal.

37:15.208 --> 37:16.287
Because if you don't,

37:16.288 --> 37:18.047
we won't give you the second dose

37:18.048 --> 37:19.087
of medicine.

37:19.088 --> 37:21.047
You'll get sick like this again,

37:21.048 --> 37:22.957
and then you'll die...

37:22.958 --> 37:25.478
but it will take awhile.

37:26.958 --> 37:28.268
Please.

37:40.628 --> 37:42.808
One more thing.

37:46.248 --> 37:48.247
We want the girls back...

37:48.248 --> 37:49.728
all of them.

38:05.595 --> 38:09.144
(crowd cheering and applauding)

38:09.145 --> 38:10.865
(camera shutters clicking)

38:32.225 --> 38:36.144
...where these young girls
have been held prisoner...

38:36.145 --> 38:37.894
NADINE: Very nice work, ma'am.

38:37.895 --> 38:40.144
Thanks, Nadine.

38:40.145 --> 38:42.014
Sure wasn't all me.

38:42.015 --> 38:44.187
The reports so far:
the cease-fire is holding

38:44.188 --> 38:46.051
in Northern Cameroon,
and the doctors have been

38:46.052 --> 38:47.358
going about their work in peace.

38:47.359 --> 38:50.528
They're making good progress
containing the outbreak.

38:50.529 --> 38:52.068
So, for a deal with the devil,

38:52.069 --> 38:53.358
we didn't do too badly.

38:53.359 --> 38:55.188
(knocking)

38:55.189 --> 38:57.278
Look who I found.

38:57.279 --> 38:58.789
DAISY: Ah, welcome back, Jay.

38:59.529 --> 39:01.728
Hey, man.

39:01.729 --> 39:04.148
Wait, the doctors are on board
with you being here, right?

39:04.149 --> 39:05.898
No, I'm contagious, and I went AWOL.

39:05.899 --> 39:06.564
Oh, good.

39:06.565 --> 39:07.228
Yeah, I'm fine.

39:07.229 --> 39:08.329
It's good to see you.

39:11.149 --> 39:12.568
And speaking of duty,

39:12.569 --> 39:14.349
we have the nation's
business to attend to.

39:18.779 --> 39:21.438
Uh, ma'am, about my
outburst at the hospital...

39:21.439 --> 39:22.438
No...

39:22.439 --> 39:23.438
don't worry about it.

39:23.439 --> 39:24.728
If I'd been in your shoes,

39:24.729 --> 39:26.648
I would have said the
same thing, believe me.

39:26.649 --> 39:28.728
No, you wouldn't have.

39:28.729 --> 39:29.988
I wanted to ask

39:29.989 --> 39:32.728
your permission to
spearhead a special project.

39:32.729 --> 39:35.108
Granted.

39:35.109 --> 39:36.398
What is it?

39:36.399 --> 39:38.818
Getting production ramped
up on the Marburg drug,

39:38.819 --> 39:40.608
so there's enough to go around.

39:40.609 --> 39:43.068
That's more of a CDC, NIH thing.

39:43.069 --> 39:44.372
It's not really a job for State.

39:44.373 --> 39:47.973
Well, I'm making it one.

39:50.729 --> 39:52.209
Sounds good.

39:55.939 --> 39:58.709
Look out, Marburg virus.

40:05.442 --> 40:07.113
_

40:07.860 --> 40:08.673
_

40:09.271 --> 40:10.017
_

40:10.519 --> 40:11.488
_

40:13.819 --> 40:15.488
(silenced gunshots)

40:15.489 --> 40:16.778
(woman screaming)

40:16.779 --> 40:18.539
(whimpering)

40:21.338 --> 40:22.420
_

40:23.051 --> 40:24.030
_

40:26.029 --> 40:29.398
(sighs) Well, I hope she's worth it,

40:29.399 --> 40:31.778
'cause right now,
she looks like a scared kid

40:31.779 --> 40:33.028
in way over her head to me.

40:33.029 --> 40:34.068
Yeah, well, don't tell

40:34.069 --> 40:35.898
the attorney general that.

40:35.899 --> 40:38.228
To wrangle this rendition,
I had to make it seem like

40:38.229 --> 40:41.188
Hijriyyah held the key to
Hizb Al-Shahid's entire network.

40:41.189 --> 40:42.648
Maybe she does.

40:42.649 --> 40:43.818
FELLOWS: Either way,

40:43.819 --> 40:44.858
she might not want to take sides

40:44.859 --> 40:45.858
against her husband and her father.

40:45.859 --> 40:47.028
I suppose that depends

40:47.029 --> 40:48.728
on whether she thinks
we're on her side.

40:48.729 --> 40:51.188
Yeah, also depends on whether
Disah believes she's dead.

40:51.189 --> 40:53.431
- There's only one way to find out.
- FELLOWS: Copy that.

40:53.432 --> 40:55.728
As soon as the operators
are clear of the tunnel,

40:55.729 --> 40:57.898
the Reaper's good to hit the compound.

40:57.899 --> 40:59.682
Let's hope Disah believes
she's still inside.

40:59.683 --> 41:03.903
Otherwise, we bought ourselves
a very expensive, scared kid.

41:05.609 --> 41:07.148
SOLDIER: We've cleared the tunnel.

41:07.149 --> 41:08.749
Fire when ready.

41:11.689 --> 41:13.528
Reheated lasagna, baby.

41:13.529 --> 41:15.728
We are living the dream.

41:15.729 --> 41:16.829
Yep.

41:19.319 --> 41:21.919
You want to go fool around
on the couch till it dings?

41:24.229 --> 41:25.709
Affirmative.

41:29.529 --> 41:30.688
So, how was your day?

41:30.689 --> 41:32.938
Oh, on balance, one of the good ones.

41:32.939 --> 41:33.988
You?

41:33.989 --> 41:35.988
Well, that remains to be seen.

41:35.989 --> 41:37.089
(door opens)

41:37.090 --> 41:38.188
STEVIE: Hey, guys.

41:38.189 --> 41:39.188
Hey, there.

41:39.189 --> 41:41.039
Hey.

41:42.529 --> 41:44.778
Um...

41:44.779 --> 41:48.419
so, we're gonna go get a bite to eat.

41:50.399 --> 41:53.028
And we were wondering

41:53.029 --> 41:55.398
if you guys would like to join us.

41:55.399 --> 41:56.528
Yeah, sure.

41:56.529 --> 41:57.648
We could get a bite.

41:57.649 --> 41:59.552
- JARETH: If you don't already have plans.
- No.

41:59.553 --> 42:00.858
No, no plans at all.

42:00.859 --> 42:02.528
(microwave dings)

42:02.529 --> 42:03.778
ELIZABETH: Oh.

42:03.779 --> 42:06.648
Jason, your lasagna's ready!

42:06.649 --> 42:07.778
JASON: What?

42:07.779 --> 42:09.358
I already ate.

42:09.359 --> 42:11.568
We'll just... gonna grab our coats.

42:11.569 --> 42:12.668
Yeah.
