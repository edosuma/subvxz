two people, and why is one of you sick?

- Please welcome Surely FÃ¼nke.

Plus, who's going to
get mad at the dying girl?

- Surely's dying?
- I figure I'll kill her off just before graduation.

- Just so everyone gets really sad before prom.
- Someone's going to get hurt.

Not to mention it's kind of disrespectful
for kids who actually have this.

- Not a lot of kids have B.S. these days.
- What does that stand for?

Your wife? She's still your wife?

02:15.256 --> 02:18.692
Well, I went to break up with her last night,
but my timing was not great.

02:18.793 --> 02:22.661
- So, I think we should talk.
- My parents are getting a divorce.

{ Crying] Why aren't you wearing
that sweater I bought you?

02:25.800 --> 02:28.166
- What, you don't like it?
- No. Of course I like it.

02:28.269 --> 02:31.363
just because I like it doesn't mean I have to
wear it. I don't wear everything I like.

02:31.472 --> 02:33.736
Why don't we just get a divorce?
Everybody else is.

02:33.841 --> 02:37.436
No! We're not getting divorced.

02:37.545 --> 02:40.275
She really wants to stay together, so...

02:40.381 --> 02:43.612

consummated it, huh?

- { Groans]

02:48.522 --> 02:50.456
- I hope you didn't break up with her?
- No, I didn't.

02:50.558 --> 02:52.458
And to make matters worse,
she gave me this.

02:52.560 --> 02:54.528
It's a summary of the evidence
that they have against Dad.

02:54.628 --> 02:58.120
Okay, Michael.
This makes matters better.

02:58.232 --> 03:00.359
Let's just destroy it
and move on with our lives.

03:00.468 --> 03:03.266
This is not the actual evidence.
It's just a list of the evidence.

03:03.370 --> 03:06.703
And judging by the amount of boxes she has
in her place, I have a feeling there's a lot.

03:06.807 --> 03:10.436
A feeling? Oh, don't tell me you won't
open it on ethical grounds?

03:10.544 --> 03:12.603
I'm not sure what I'm going to do.

03:12.713 --> 03:16.342
- What is with the insane moral code in this family?
- Yes, we did it.

03:16.450 --> 03:19.749
We're getting rid of the Ten Commandments.
The granite ones in front of the courthouse.

03:19.854 --> 03:21.822
You know, all it took
was the threat of a lawsuit.

03:21.922 --> 03:24.618
You're involved with those protesters now?
When did that happen?

03:24.725 --> 03:26.590
Oh, who can remember.

<i>I've always been very passionate about</i>
<i>the separation of church and state.</i>

03:51.352 --> 03:54.150
- What are you gonna do with them?
- Give 'em to a school.

03:54.255 --> 03:56.883
Can we let another family
bring down the Ten Commandments?

03:56.991 --> 03:58.925
This family's already done
more than its share.

03:59.026 --> 04:01.654
Oh, now you love
the Ten Commandments.

04:01.762 --> 04:05.596
And yet, you're the one who so conveniently
forgot "Thou shalt protect thy father...

04:05.699 --> 04:09.931
and honor no one above him
unless it beith me... thy sweet Lord."

04:10.037 --> 04:12.631
I'm not sure that one
made it down the mountain, Gob.

04:12.740 --> 04:15.300
- I told you someone would get hurt.
- If I knew it was you...

04:15.409 --> 04:17.639
- I wouldn't have been so worried.
- Hey, what happened to you?

04:17.745 --> 04:21.545
He was trying to help some handicapped
girl up to the bleachers, and he fell.

04:21.649 --> 04:25.016
It's just a sprain.
But at least it's legitimate.

04:25.119 --> 04:28.577
Ah, <i>le</i> clumsy adolescence.
It's a phase we've all been through.

04:28.689 --> 04:33.820
Except for me. I was like a cat.
I always ended up on all fours.

04:36.430 --> 04:40.389
- Like a cat.
- Wait a minute. They don't
have ramps at your school?

04:40.501 --> 04:43.470
- Well, not up the bleachers.
- You should threaten to sue.

04:43.571 --> 04:47.302
- It's free if it's just a threat, you know.
- Hey, that's a good idea.

04:47.408 --> 04:49.569
No one's gonna sue anybody.
I'm not gonna have my son...

04:49.677 --> 04:52.145
start abusing the legal system
like the rest of this family.

04:52.246 --> 04:56.706
After all, we're gonna need it
for years to come.

04:56.817 --> 04:59.377
<i>[Narrator] And that's when Michael</i>
<i>decided to do the right thing.</i>

05:02.923 --> 05:07.553
So what do you think? Do we have
a case against this idiot family or what?

05:07.661 --> 05:10.630
Well, that's actually why
I wanted to talk to you, Maggie.

05:10.731 --> 05:16.363
You see, uh, it turns out that
I am actually one of those idiots.

05:16.470 --> 05:20.930
I might even be the main idiot. Well, I'm not
the main idiot, but I'm the idiot in charge.

05:21.041 --> 05:23.839
Yeah. I'm Michael Bluth. Okay?

05:23.944 --> 05:26.276
And I want you to know that
I never opened up this folder.

05:26.380 --> 05:29.679
And if you could see my face...

05:29.783 --> 05:32.684
uh, you'd see how sorry I am
that I lied to you.

05:36.056 --> 05:38.456
You feel sincere.

05:38.559 --> 05:42.518
Damn it. I have spent
the last five hours hating you...

05:42.630 --> 05:44.962
ever since I found out you were
Michael Bluth in court.

05:45.065 --> 05:48.967
- What? How did you know?
- I'm blind, Michael.

05:49.069 --> 05:51.435
- I'm not stuffed up.
- You smelled me.

05:51.538 --> 05:55.269
- I smelled you, baby.
- Maggie, why didn't you tell me at your house?

05:55.376 --> 05:57.401
And why did you give me this folder?

05:57.511 --> 06:01.072
I was manipulating you.
This isn't the real list.

06:01.181 --> 06:04.878
- This is a wish list.
- I can't believe you set me up.

06:04.985 --> 06:07.453
Well, you lied to me.
Chareth Cutestory?

06:07.554 --> 06:09.715
I know."Thou shalt not
make up a name in vain."

06:09.823 --> 06:13.452
But, you know, I walked into that court,
and I saw you there...

06:13.560 --> 06:18.088
- and... this can't happen, right?
- You're damn right this can't happen.

06:18.198 --> 06:20.996
Look at me. This could get me...
Are you actually looking at me?

06:21.101 --> 06:24.093
- Yes, I am.
- Okay. I could get disbarred for this.

06:24.204 --> 06:26.934
And your dad would have to
spend tons more time in prison.

06:27.041 --> 06:29.839
I gotta tell you something.
The thing that really gets to me is...

06:29.944 --> 06:33.903
that I keep hearing that Michael Bluth is so...
{ Beeps] cute.

06:34.014 --> 06:39.646
Well, I know Maggie Lizer is adorable.
You don't know what you're missing.

06:39.753 --> 06:41.482
- Really?
- Really.

06:41.588 --> 06:46.218
- So what are we gonna do?
- I guess we're just gonna
have to go our separate ways...

06:46.327 --> 06:49.421
- and agree to never speak about this again.
- That is probably best, huh?

06:49.530 --> 06:53.591
The least you can do is buy me a drink.

06:53.701 --> 06:56.602
Hmm. Yeah. I'll stay for one drink.

to talk to my dad in half an hour.

- I can't believe we did this again.
- It was so stupid.

07:20.661 --> 07:26.293

This is the second most
unethical thing I've ever done.

this didn't happen, Maggie.
- Or that it won't happen again.

- You think it's gonna happen again?
- You tell me.

- Let's just assume that it will
happen again at some time.
- Right. Right.

acknowledge this and keep it private...

anything wrong with that.

- "Be true to thine own self,
and to thine own self..."
- "Be true." Yeah.

08:11.979 --> 08:14.880
