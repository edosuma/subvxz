I haven't been looking
at anything. Deliberately, Rava.

12:26.502 --> 12:29.283
"Kendall Roy
ran the streets of New York,

12:29.293 --> 12:30.951
sweaty and incoherent,

12:30.961 --> 12:33.158
ranting about a coup against his father,

12:33.168 --> 12:36.158
but couldn't find his way to the
board room to start said coup.

12:36.168 --> 12:37.575
Is he back on drugs?

12:37.585 --> 12:39.075
We couldn't possibly say,

12:39.085 --> 12:41.867
but some people are saying that."

12:41.877 --> 12:44.117
Rava, listen to me.

12:44.127 --> 12:45.659
OK, that's... That's not true.

12:45.669 --> 12:47.409
- Yeah.
- OK? That's not true.

12:47.419 --> 12:50.075
Mm-hmm. It's just
that's what you used to say

12:50.085 --> 12:51.200
when it was true.

12:51.210 --> 12:52.367
Jesus, I'm not using, Rava.

12:52.377 --> 12:54.200
I... I don't touch anything.

12:54.210 --> 12:57.200
And you know that.
Jesus Christ. Come on.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.033
But look, unrelated,

12:59.043 --> 13:01.742
this weekend Iverson's got his tests

13:01.752 --> 13:03.920
and if we break his routine,
it's gonna affect things.

13:03.931 --> 13:06.701
- You know?
- No. No.

13:06.711 --> 13:08.409
Fuck, come on.

13:08.419 --> 13:10.575
Please don't get angry.

13:10.585 --> 13:12.784
I'm not... I'm not fucking angry.

13:12.794 --> 13:14.367
OK? I want to see my kids.

13:14.377 --> 13:17.325
I'm not on drugs,
I'm not touching drugs,

13:17.335 --> 13:19.367
I don't use drugs anymore,
I'm not on drugs,

13:19.377 --> 13:21.075
I'm not on fucking drugs.

13:21.085 --> 13:23.752
Yeah, it's the paranoid rant
that's so convincing.

TOM:
Well, I actually think

13:34.002 --> 13:35.867
it's really brave to go.

13:35.877 --> 13:37.659
Oh, thank you. I'm a hero.

13:37.669 --> 13:39.325
- Hmm.
- Ugh.

13:39.335 --> 13:41.075
Can you imagine?

13:41.085 --> 13:43.283
Connor, Dad, Roman, feelings?

13:43.293 --> 13:46.075
It's gonna be like tossing a bag
of Uzis into the soft play area.

13:46.085 --> 13:47.534
I know your dad doesn't believe

13:47.544 --> 13:49.534
you didn't know what Kendall was up to,

13:49.544 --> 13:51.909
and he spoke abominably to you.

13:51.919 --> 13:54.575
And, um, just for context,

13:54.585 --> 13:56.951
do you think it would be
appropriate this weekend,

13:56.961 --> 13:58.492
in a bridge-building way,

13:58.502 --> 14:00.075
for me to be speaking to Logan, or no?

14:00.085 --> 14:03.117
Just do what you think is right.

14:03.127 --> 14:05.409
Yeah, sure. I got it. I just, you know,

14:05.419 --> 14:07.492
I want to have your back,

14:07.502 --> 14:11.117
and, uh, there's also my back,

14:11.127 --> 14:13.450

we're a beast with two backs.

14:13.460 --> 14:15.784
I get it. You're your own guy.

14:15.794 --> 14:16.951
I won't judge you.

- Yeah.

MARCIA: Austerlitz? Was this
the name when you bought it?

15:05.002 --> 15:07.242
WILLA: Oh, it was racially insensitive,

15:07.252 --> 15:08.617
so he picked a new one.

So, son, have you got
somewhere for them to set up?

15:17.961 --> 15:19.742
So you're also working?

15:19.752 --> 15:23.200

Wow. Yeah.

- CONNOR: Yeah, it is.

16:04.919 --> 16:07.450
- Is that a church?
- Yeah, that's the chapel.

- It's a chapel.

Do you think Dad will be able
to cross the threshold?

16:14.669 --> 16:16.367
Or will be spontaneously combust?

Good question.

the next ranch over.

16:24.002 --> 16:26.575
I told him to pop in.
Just wanted to say hi.

Ho! Yeah, that's what everybody says.

Nah, I'm always ribbing him.

Did you know that three out of
every hundred bunches of grapes

16:39.210 --> 16:41.450
has over the legal limit of pesticides?

16:41.460 --> 16:42.784
So you wash 'em.

You can't wash your colon, Mr. Poison.

16:49.170 --> 16:51.242
He thinks she knew about the coup.

16:51.252 --> 16:54.492
So Logan will talk to Shiv
as long as she says "sorry."

16:54.502 --> 16:57.409
Well, I think that
Shiv's position would be

16:57.419 --> 16:59.367
that she's got nothing to be sorry for.

16:59.377 --> 17:02.450
I mean, obviously she's sad,

17:02.460 --> 17:04.617
you know, there's sadness.

we're all gathered here
in this beautiful home

19:49.335 --> 19:51.659

19:51.669 --> 19:55.534
and I believe we should... address them.

19:55.544 --> 19:58.492

that we'll also have

I look forward to
us all sitting down tomorrow,

20:19.544 --> 20:22.992

it takes a lot of courage,

20:23.002 --> 20:25.659
and that is not lost on me.

21:35.752 --> 21:38.659
I mean, the whole reason I came down
here is to do this family thing,

21:38.669 --> 21:41.200
and that's today. So...

21:41.210 --> 21:43.242
So?

21:43.252 --> 21:44.742
Can he reschedule?

21:44.752 --> 21:46.617
He's pretty fuckin' busy.

21:46.627 --> 21:48.701
Ahh. Oh, fuck.

21:48.711 --> 21:51.242
Doesn't look good, turning him down.

21:51.252 --> 21:52.826
Well, obviously I want to...

21:52.836 --> 21:54.951
Come on, Shiv, this is huge.

21:54.961 --> 21:57.742
- But I can't. Right now.

moderately intense, so go easy.

of this whole genetic carnival.

22:22.252 --> 22:24.117
- It's OK.
- You sure?

22:24.127 --> 22:25.127
Yeah.

22:29.877 --> 22:31.283
ALON:
Morning.

22:31.293 --> 22:33.158
OK. Let's do this.

22:33.168 --> 22:36.168
The therapy? This way for the therapy.

22:41.085 --> 22:42.784
Whoo.

22:49.961 --> 22:51.867
Like waving your kids off to school.

22:51.877 --> 22:55.033
They better not gang up on him.

22:55.043 --> 22:56.502
He's still frail.

22:58.419 --> 23:00.534
Roll up, roll up,

23:00.544 --> 23:02.826

23:02.836 --> 23:07.200
- LOGAN: OK, son? Good.
- CONNOR: Yeah.

23:07.210 --> 23:09.158
OK. Great.

23:09.168 --> 23:11.075
So, welcome, welcome.

23:11.085 --> 23:13.158
I like to begin these things

23:13.168 --> 23:15.033
with a little prayer.

23:15.043 --> 23:18.575
Uh, they fuck you up, your mom and dad.

23:18.585 --> 23:22.909
They do not mean to, but they do.

23:22.919 --> 23:25.450
They fill you up with faults they had

23:25.460 --> 23:27.951
and add some extra just for you.

23:27.961 --> 23:30.909
Now, I always think
that's an interesting way

23:30.919 --> 23:32.617
to start these things,

23:32.627 --> 23:34.909
but what I'd like to know is,

23:34.919 --> 23:38.075
how you feel
you would like to start this.

23:38.085 --> 23:41.283
So...

23:41.293 --> 23:45.043
who's going to tell us
why we are here today?

23:53.711 --> 23:57.669
Come on. Does no one want
to take a pop at the champ?

24:00.794 --> 24:02.742
- Can I just say...
- ALON: Sure.

24:02.752 --> 24:04.701
I never touched Roman inappropriately.

24:04.711 --> 24:06.659
If he says I did, I didn't.

24:06.669 --> 24:08.534
SHIV:
Glad to clear that up.

24:08.544 --> 24:11.450
He was gonna make a horrible
joke, so I'm preempting.

24:11.460 --> 24:12.575
ALON: OK. OK.

24:12.585 --> 24:14.575
But I think the best way
to start this...

24:14.585 --> 24:17.242
Uh. I'll start if you'd like.

24:17.252 --> 24:19.409
ALON:
Yeah, Please.

24:19.419 --> 24:22.659
Um... everything I've done in my life,

24:22.669 --> 24:25.283
I've done for my children.

24:25.293 --> 24:28.242
I know I've made mistakes,

24:28.252 --> 24:29.742
but, um,

24:29.752 --> 24:33.325
I've always tried to do
the best by them...

24:33.335 --> 24:37.585
because... they mean everything to me.

24:42.585 --> 24:45.409
OK. That was great.

24:45.419 --> 24:47.492
Thank you.

24:47.502 --> 24:50.659
- Well, that's nice.
- It is nice.

24:50.669 --> 24:52.909
Yeah, sure. Agreed.

24:52.919 --> 24:55.575
So, what do we feel about
what we just heard here?

24:55.585 --> 24:58.158
I mean, I hear it.

24:58.168 --> 24:59.460
I hear it.

25:01.752 --> 25:03.325
Uh-huh. Big words.

25:03.335 --> 25:04.460
Good words.

25:07.127 --> 25:10.283
Oh. I'm still... processing,

25:10.293 --> 25:13.033
but yeah.

25:13.043 --> 25:16.701
Logan, do you realize how much
power you wield in this room?

25:16.711 --> 25:17.909
What do you mean?

25:17.919 --> 25:19.252
He has a lot of power everywhere.

25:21.961 --> 25:24.033
ALON:
What I guess I'm asking is,

25:24.043 --> 25:25.992
how do you feel about
what you just said?

25:26.002 --> 25:27.951
Look, everything I've done in my life

25:27.961 --> 25:29.676
I've done for my children.

25:29.687 --> 25:31.387
- I know I've made mistakes...
- Uh, Dad,

25:31.398 --> 25:32.853
you can't just use the one sentence.

25:32.864 --> 25:34.617
But that's how I feel, Siobhan.

25:34.627 --> 25:36.534
I can make this shit up if you like.

25:36.544 --> 25:38.325
Sounds like you already are.

25:38.335 --> 25:41.711
- Shiv?
- Look, I'm...

25:43.377 --> 25:44.867
I guess where I'm coming from is

25:44.877 --> 25:46.951
I'm having a hard time diving in because

25:46.961 --> 25:50.242
honestly, I'm wondering why he
brought us here in the first place.

25:50.252 --> 25:52.037
I mean, was it for
this photo opportunity?

25:52.048 --> 25:53.450
LOGAN: No, no, of course not.

25:53.460 --> 25:56.534
I wouldn't have brought you here
for a photo and an interview...

25:56.544 --> 25:58.659
Sorry. Excuse me?
There's an interview now?

25:58.669 --> 26:01.325
- Well, I told you, photo and...
- No, you didn't.

26:01.335 --> 26:03.784
What, so this is essentially
a publicity event?

26:03.794 --> 26:06.367
It's optional. There won't be questions.

26:06.377 --> 26:07.575
This is not OK.

26:07.585 --> 26:09.826
I have a publicist for this stuff.

26:09.836 --> 26:12.200
Fuck. Con, did you know about this?

26:12.210 --> 26:13.867
I think the picture is OK.

26:13.877 --> 26:15.033
I think it's nice.

26:15.043 --> 26:16.544
Rome?

26:17.794 --> 26:18.895
I don't mind.

26:21.794 --> 26:23.909
ALON: Logan, have you thought
about the possibility

26:23.919 --> 26:26.575
that your children
are actually scared of you?

26:26.585 --> 26:28.450
Aw, fuck off.

26:28.460 --> 26:31.544
After what they've done to me? Fuck off!

26:33.043 --> 26:34.992
Tell me, do you think

26:35.002 --> 26:37.117
you'll always do what you do?

26:37.127 --> 26:38.367
What, the theater?

26:38.377 --> 26:41.492
Yes, and what you do for money.

26:41.502 --> 26:42.992
Uh-huh.

26:43.002 --> 26:45.534
Uh, well, you know, I like my life,

26:45.544 --> 26:48.534
and kind of just go with the flow,

26:48.544 --> 26:52.784
so yeah, I think I'll just
slide more over

26:52.794 --> 26:55.992
into producing or writing or directing.

26:56.002 --> 26:59.659
I knew a woman in Paris,
she did what you do.

26:59.669 --> 27:01.575
She was very intelligent.

27:01.585 --> 27:03.575
Oh, thank you.

27:03.585 --> 27:06.033
And do you want children?

27:06.043 --> 27:09.659
Um, I don't know. Maybe one day.

27:09.669 --> 27:11.909
Don't wait. That's all I will say.

27:11.919 --> 27:14.158
The old biological clock
starts a-ticking.

27:14.168 --> 27:15.534
You could always freeze.

27:15.544 --> 27:17.909
That's a way of putting off life.

27:17.919 --> 27:20.742
I'd like Shiv to freeze.
Embryos, not eggs.

27:20.752 --> 27:22.158
A little bit of me in the bank.

27:22.168 --> 27:23.951
Thought about that?

27:23.961 --> 27:26.575
Ahh, so much advice! Wow!

27:26.585 --> 27:29.909
You know, my friend from Paris
who was your way?

27:29.919 --> 27:31.919
She actually was murdered.

27:34.168 --> 27:37.033
It was nothing to do
with her being a prostitute,

27:37.043 --> 27:39.585
it was to do with a restaurant
that went poof!

28:10.544 --> 28:13.826
Hey, do you have any non-alcoholic beer?

28:13.836 --> 28:15.867
No. Sorry.

28:15.877 --> 28:17.992
OK. How about sparkling water?

28:18.002 --> 28:20.075
Mm-hmm.

28:20.085 --> 28:22.075
You a tourist?

28:22.085 --> 28:24.409
Uh, kind of.

28:24.419 --> 28:25.794
Hmm.

28:29.002 --> 28:30.742
Oh. Fancy.

Kendall Roy?

28:32.502 --> 28:34.544
You here visiting family?

28:36.377 --> 28:38.200
Connor Roy?

28:38.210 --> 28:39.742
What?

28:39.752 --> 28:42.075
No, it's OK, I probably think the same.

28:42.085 --> 28:44.951
- Yeah. There's just stories.
- Like?

28:44.961 --> 28:46.992
Like, he came in here one night,

28:47.002 --> 28:49.992
he had this dog with cancer that
he couldn't let the vet kill

28:50.002 --> 28:51.534
but he couldn't watch it die either,

28:51.544 --> 28:53.659
so he dragged that thing
around the whole bar

28:53.669 --> 28:56.075
asking somebody if they'd take
it and give it a good life.

28:56.085 --> 28:58.669
He said, "I'll pay you.
I just can't watch."

29:00.711 --> 29:03.617
Anyway, Skunkhead Tanner over there

29:03.627 --> 29:06.158
took three grand,
shot her in the parking lot.

29:06.168 --> 29:07.367
Jesus.

29:07.377 --> 29:08.992
- What?
- None of your business.

29:09.002 --> 29:10.367
I was talking about Skunkhead.

29:10.377 --> 29:12.575
Don't talk shit about me, Janelle.

29:12.585 --> 29:14.492
Oh, really? (LAUGHS)

Hey, also, can I get
a double Smirnoff rocks?

29:33.419 --> 29:35.043
- Lime?
- No.

29:49.335 --> 29:50.413
Keep it open.

29:51.627 --> 29:54.534
Heard you killed my brother's dog.

29:54.544 --> 29:56.450
ALON: Look, can we go
back to our agreement

29:56.460 --> 29:57.951
where we put aside our cell phones,

29:57.961 --> 30:00.450
just focus on what's going on this room?

30:00.460 --> 30:01.992
Can we do that?

30:02.002 --> 30:05.117
I'm trying to buy a number
of television stations.

30:05.127 --> 30:07.419
OK, but could you do it later?

30:13.919 --> 30:17.492
Fine. Tell me what more you
want and I'll dance the dance.

30:17.502 --> 30:20.242
I guess what I want
is for you to tell us

30:20.252 --> 30:21.492
how you are feeling?

30:21.502 --> 30:23.242
- How I'm feeling?
- Mm-hmm.

30:23.252 --> 30:26.117
I feel...

30:26.127 --> 30:27.784
I need to check my emails.

30:27.794 --> 30:29.534
That's not a feeling, Dad.

30:29.544 --> 30:32.075
Maybe don't deny Dad's feelings, Shiv.

30:32.085 --> 30:34.951
I turned down something huge to be
here, and you're gonna tank it.

30:34.961 --> 30:37.117
- I'm doing therapy.
- I don't think you are.

30:37.127 --> 30:38.283
LOGAN: I am.

30:38.293 --> 30:39.909
Now you're denying their feelings, Dad.

30:39.919 --> 30:43.117
Look, what I think we should
really have a conversation about

30:43.127 --> 30:45.450
is the fact that Kendall's not here.

30:45.460 --> 30:48.117
And that's because
there are reports of him

30:48.127 --> 30:49.951
running around taking drugs.

30:49.961 --> 30:52.311
And I, for one, don't know where
those have come from.

30:52.322 --> 30:53.745
You don't have to worry about that.

30:53.756 --> 30:55.575
What does that mean?

30:55.585 --> 30:57.951
I'm not getting into that
today. It's beyond the remit.

30:57.961 --> 31:00.117
I don't really think
there is a remit, Dad.

31:00.127 --> 31:02.409
I had nothin' to do with those stories.

31:02.419 --> 31:05.460
Shiv, do you believe your father?

31:10.502 --> 31:12.951
- Well...
- ALON: Go on.

31:12.961 --> 31:14.534
Honestly, no.

31:14.544 --> 31:16.460
I think this whole thing is fake.

31:18.335 --> 31:19.742
ALON:
Roman?

31:19.752 --> 31:21.377
I don't know.

31:23.419 --> 31:24.961
I don't know.

31:26.502 --> 31:28.659
- No.
- ROMAN: I mean,

31:28.669 --> 31:31.534
he might not have meant to, but...

31:31.544 --> 31:34.409
- no, I don't believe him.
- I'm sorry!

31:34.419 --> 31:35.534
I'm sorry!

31:35.544 --> 31:36.659
All right?!

31:36.669 --> 31:38.158
I'm finished.

31:38.168 --> 31:41.492
I'll apologize as much
as you fuckin' like,

31:41.502 --> 31:43.617
but I can't get into everything.

31:43.627 --> 31:45.335
That's it.

31:50.293 --> 31:52.325
ALON:
You know, Logan,

31:52.335 --> 31:56.534
if I'm asked if I thought that you
participated in this family therapy

31:56.544 --> 31:58.992
in an earnest way,

31:59.002 --> 32:01.659
I don't think that I could
answer in good conscience

32:01.669 --> 32:03.158
that you have.

32:03.168 --> 32:06.242
Fine. I apologize.

32:06.252 --> 32:07.826
Maybe I'm hungry.

32:07.836 --> 32:09.168
I got nothin' to hide.

32:11.419 --> 32:12.784
OK.

32:12.794 --> 32:14.534
How about we take a break

32:14.544 --> 32:17.200
and begin again,
clean slate, this afternoon?

32:17.210 --> 32:18.210
Hmm?

32:19.711 --> 32:22.617
So come on, come on, tell me.

32:22.627 --> 32:25.784
What did everybody say in there? Huh?

32:25.794 --> 32:28.867
Was it nothing too horrible
or upsetting?

32:28.877 --> 32:30.534
Was it just disgusting?

32:30.544 --> 32:33.283
Hey, I'm gonna go down
to Santa Fe to meet Gil.

32:33.293 --> 32:36.450
Oh. What? So everything
has been resolved in there?

32:36.460 --> 32:39.242
Yeah. Totally.

32:39.252 --> 32:41.450
We're all completely sane. All resolved.

32:41.460 --> 32:42.460
Uh-huh. Come on.

32:44.711 --> 32:46.742
- Can I take a car?
- What's up?

32:46.752 --> 32:48.742
- Wait. What are you doing?
- The Tesla.

32:48.752 --> 32:50.750
I'm going into town. I've got a meeting.

32:50.761 --> 32:52.856
I'm not gonna take this
seriously if no one else is.

32:52.867 --> 32:54.598
CONNOR: But we're getting
somewhere, Shiv.

32:54.609 --> 32:56.158
I can feel it. He's breaking down.

32:56.168 --> 32:59.409
You're sweet and I love you,
but you're delusional.

32:59.419 --> 33:01.826
Well, you can't do that.
Is that allowed?

33:01.836 --> 33:06.242
Well, I think Shiv is capable
of making an adult decision.

33:06.252 --> 33:08.534
But here's what I was thinkin'.

33:08.544 --> 33:10.617
Why don't we all take a break? Huh?

33:10.627 --> 33:13.575
Just get out of our heads
and into our good bodies.

33:13.585 --> 33:15.534
You know? Let's go for a swim.

33:15.544 --> 33:17.992
Everybody. You know?
Get your dad out there.

33:18.002 --> 33:19.283
- Dad can't swim.
- SHIV: Yeah.

33:19.293 --> 33:21.325
He doesn't even trust water.

33:21.335 --> 33:22.742
It's too wishy-washy.

33:22.752 --> 33:23.784
Can I have the keys?

33:23.794 --> 33:26.075
- Thank you.
- Seriously?

33:26.085 --> 33:27.117
Yeah.

33:27.127 --> 33:28.826
- Hey, Willa.
- Yeah?

33:28.836 --> 33:30.283
Hey, honey,

33:30.293 --> 33:32.701
do you know about
the family photo for later?

33:32.711 --> 33:34.242
Yeah, it'll be nice.

33:34.252 --> 33:35.909
Yeah, well, um,

33:35.919 --> 33:39.200
there was an idea that maybe
you should sit it out.

33:39.210 --> 33:42.242
- Uh-huh.
- I'm sorry.

33:42.252 --> 33:45.659
No, no, it's OK. I'll probably
end up getting murdered anyway.

33:45.669 --> 33:47.367
Nobody's murdering you.

33:47.377 --> 33:50.617
- (SIGHS)
- You're adorable.

33:50.627 --> 33:53.659
You're unmurderable. (LAUGHS)

33:53.669 --> 33:56.627
Um... Look, you know...

34:01.210 --> 34:03.659
You know I appreciate you.

34:03.669 --> 34:05.325
I appreciate you, too.

34:05.335 --> 34:07.492
And I think you're better
than all of them.

34:07.502 --> 34:09.867
Th-Thank you.

34:09.877 --> 34:12.742
Look, I know that
we talked about this before,

34:12.752 --> 34:16.242
but I was just wondering

34:16.252 --> 34:19.324
if you could...

34:19.335 --> 34:21.793
well, would you...

34:24.168 --> 34:25.992
I don't know how to say this,

34:26.002 --> 34:30.992
except to say that love is a
strange and peculiar affliction.

34:31.002 --> 34:34.158
It's... It's like a virus.

34:34.168 --> 34:38.534
So could you please
just stay here for a while...

34:38.543 --> 34:41.367
- and maybe you'll catch it.
- Con.

34:41.378 --> 34:43.061
What I mean is that
you would have an allowance

34:43.072 --> 34:44.701
and you would continue to write

34:44.710 --> 34:46.701
and you continue to travel to New York,

34:46.710 --> 34:50.043
and I would help you build
a life in the theater.

34:52.043 --> 34:53.367
Gosh, that's a lot.

34:53.377 --> 34:56.158
Yeah, but we have so many great ideas.

34:56.168 --> 34:58.742
Yeah. Sure. No, we do.

34:58.752 --> 35:02.033
So we could do family,
but we could do it different.

35:02.043 --> 35:04.659
I mean...

35:04.669 --> 35:06.200
we could try.

35:06.210 --> 35:08.075
Exactly! Why not? Yeah?

35:08.085 --> 35:09.325
Yeah!

35:09.335 --> 35:11.450
- Yeah?
- Yeah. (LAUGHS)

35:11.460 --> 35:13.117
Hey, I love you.

35:13.127 --> 35:17.033
And... I, um...

35:17.043 --> 35:18.544
I love you.

35:23.210 --> 35:26.252
See? That wasn't so hard,
was it? (LAUGHS)

35:30.794 --> 35:32.659
OK. Lot of wolf stuff.

35:32.669 --> 35:35.200
Yeah, man, I love the wolves.

35:35.210 --> 35:36.992
Uh-huh.

35:37.002 --> 35:40.325
- He really likes the wolves.
- Yeah. Cool.

35:40.335 --> 35:42.325
My mom says I was a wolf child.

35:42.335 --> 35:44.753
That's 'cause she never bothered
to take care of you, Chang.

35:44.764 --> 35:47.784
That's just fuckin' salesmanship
of her neglect.

35:47.794 --> 35:50.117
- (IMITATES WOLF HOWLING)
- KENDALL: Nice.

35:50.127 --> 35:53.158
- You get wolves here?
- Nope.

35:53.168 --> 35:55.419
- No? OK.
- Fuckin' wish.

35:59.585 --> 36:01.075
I never did meth.

36:01.085 --> 36:03.242
And I'm technically sober,

36:03.252 --> 36:05.617
so this is kind of an experiment.

36:05.627 --> 36:07.293
(LAUGHS)

36:13.460 --> 36:14.794
There we go.

36:43.711 --> 36:45.919
Wow. (CLEARS THROAT)

36:51.127 --> 36:56.502
There's a thing now that Type A's
actually can't get addicted.

36:58.002 --> 36:59.826
Ya know? 'Cause we are addicted.

36:59.836 --> 37:02.283
You know, if it wasn't
for wolves, we couldn't speak.

37:02.293 --> 37:04.992
It's from having to tell dogs what to do

37:05.002 --> 37:07.242
that we actually had a need
to talk out loud,

37:07.252 --> 37:08.575
you know, to command 'em?

37:08.585 --> 37:11.283
You guys, come on. We got a real person.

37:11.293 --> 37:13.659
Let's not attack his brain.

37:13.669 --> 37:15.325
We should get some more.

- Yeah?

37:17.002 --> 37:19.409
And, uh, maybe some weed.

37:19.419 --> 37:22.033
- Right.
- Some Oxys, some...

37:22.043 --> 37:23.367
some goodies.

37:23.377 --> 37:25.158
So, you like it?

37:25.168 --> 37:28.325
Experiment successful.

37:28.335 --> 37:30.033

of what's down there.

Pretend it's our subconscious
and just go for it.

37:43.877 --> 37:44.951
I know how to dive.

37:44.961 --> 37:46.242
Yeah, you gotta jump.

an accident in the pool.

An accident in the pool.

37:58.335 --> 38:02.033
We don't know if he got
a head injury, or...

38:02.043 --> 38:03.659
He just dived in and he hit the bottom.

38:03.669 --> 38:05.701
- Did you hit your head?
- (ALON MUMBLING)

38:05.711 --> 38:07.951
- He hit his teeth?
- His teeth are in his head,

Connor, it's kind of a central feature.

38:09.752 --> 38:11.033
It's clearly signed.
What were you thinking?

38:11.043 --> 38:12.850
Shall I call an ambulance?

38:12.861 --> 38:14.949
I didn't think he'd jump
in headfirst. Hi, Karolina.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.617
Hey, Roman. Don't let him go to sleep.

38:16.627 --> 38:18.194
(MUFFLED) I don't want to go
to fuckin' sleep!

38:18.205 --> 38:19.909
Let's take a look. The bleeding always

38:19.919 --> 38:21.826
makes it look worse than it actually...

38:21.836 --> 38:22.909
Jesus Christ!

38:22.919 --> 38:25.075
Let's take him to the hospital.

38:25.085 --> 38:27.659
- Really?
- ROMAN: No, you're OK, man.

38:27.669 --> 38:28.951
It's OK. You look OK.

38:28.961 --> 38:30.659
It'll be faster if I just
take him myself.

38:30.669 --> 38:32.409
No, no, no, send your guys. Send Colin.

38:32.419 --> 38:34.701
- We should stay.
- No, I want to help him ou...

38:34.711 --> 38:36.409
I want to make sure he's not litigious.

38:36.419 --> 38:39.033
Fuckin' great! And I was about
to take advice from a clown

38:39.043 --> 38:42.168
who dives headfirst into the
shallow end of the pool!

38:42.179 --> 38:43.658
And now everyone's fucking off!

38:43.669 --> 38:44.784
It's OK. I got you.

39:24.210 --> 39:27.117
So... how are you?

39:27.127 --> 39:28.784
Really?

39:28.794 --> 39:31.450
Well, my family's fucked.

39:31.460 --> 39:34.659
I'm not talking about to my dad,
and my brother's suing my dad.

39:34.669 --> 39:38.325
Sorry. If family isn't right,
nothing feels right.

39:38.335 --> 39:40.325
Yeah. And how are you?

39:40.335 --> 39:41.701
You gonna go for it?

39:41.711 --> 39:44.742
I'm feeling really good.

39:44.752 --> 39:49.033
Suffered some depression
last year after everything,

39:49.043 --> 39:52.117
but, um... I'm good.

39:52.127 --> 39:54.992
And so, what, you want me
to handle the message on that?

39:55.002 --> 39:57.367
No. That's just the truth.

39:57.377 --> 39:59.575
Look, Siobhan,

39:59.585 --> 40:01.784
I'm not gonna make you do a dance.

40:01.794 --> 40:04.492
I'm finalizing. Nate and me
want you on the team.

40:04.502 --> 40:05.826
What do you think?

40:05.836 --> 40:07.951
Well, I think you're too radical.

40:07.961 --> 40:09.784
(LAUGHS)

40:09.794 --> 40:12.617
I'm not telling you
anything you don't know.

40:12.627 --> 40:15.784
The good politician,
he figures out what people need

40:15.794 --> 40:17.877
and then he sells it back
to them as what they want.

40:18.961 --> 40:22.033
So... this is a job offer?

40:22.043 --> 40:23.158
Well, yes.

40:23.168 --> 40:24.617
But there's an issue.

40:24.627 --> 40:26.575
What, my name?

40:26.585 --> 40:30.117
One section of my base would be
outraged for me even meeting with you.

40:30.127 --> 40:33.701
Yeah, well, that section has
nowhere else to go, so fuck 'em.

40:33.711 --> 40:35.210
(SOFTLY) Yeah.

40:36.794 --> 40:40.450
Look, if I'm gonna win big
the way I want to,

40:40.460 --> 40:42.325
to remake this country for the better...

Ooh! La-dee-dah.

40:52.168 --> 40:53.909
No, no, no, of course. Of course.

that I won't betray you?

41:09.085 --> 41:12.585
Well, I guess I trust you.

41:17.043 --> 41:20.909
I can work with Nate,
but I can't work for Nate.

41:20.919 --> 41:23.534
It's fine, it's just a...
it's a preposition thing.

41:23.544 --> 41:24.951
We can figure all that out.

41:24.961 --> 41:27.242
The bigger question is,

41:27.252 --> 41:29.752

to go to war with your family?

to do that, or are you just
