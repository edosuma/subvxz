00:06.540 --> 00:08.674
<i>( water dripping )</i>

00:08.676 --> 00:11.343
This lot's
the foul-tempered sort.

00:16.017 --> 00:19.618
Big enough to be worth a worry,
but we know how to handle him.

00:22.790 --> 00:24.623
<i>( lock clicks )</i>

00:33.100 --> 00:34.733
Leave us now, please.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.440
Henry Dawkins?

00:43.277 --> 00:45.344
Hmm.

00:45.346 --> 00:48.580
Born in London,
accomplice to Isaac Ketcham.

00:48.582 --> 00:52.284
If by accomplice you mean the
whittler who done set me up.

00:52.286 --> 00:54.720
You never claimed innocence
during your trial.

00:54.722 --> 00:57.122
Oh, is that what
I should have done?

00:57.124 --> 00:59.258
Where were you, sir?

00:59.260 --> 01:01.460
I have the power to release you

01:01.462 --> 01:03.629
from this place this instant.

01:03.631 --> 01:07.199
But first I need the truth.

01:07.201 --> 01:09.601
Did you do
what they said you did?

01:09.603 --> 01:12.171
Why?

01:12.173 --> 01:14.239
Because I need you
to do it again.

01:18.379 --> 01:20.479
( chatter )

01:28.422 --> 01:30.689
<i>( door opens )</i>

01:38.332 --> 01:40.199
Major.

01:52.279 --> 01:54.513
A double edition, no doubt.

01:54.515 --> 01:56.815
I wonder what
the bloody news is now.

01:56.817 --> 01:59.518
Mr. Rivington
is in the fashion

01:59.520 --> 02:02.488
of reporting the news
before it happens.

02:02.490 --> 02:05.591
Perhaps some great victory
is expected soon.

02:05.593 --> 02:08.526
( scoffs ) I've heard of
no such thing planned.

02:08.529 --> 02:10.795
It's nearly winter,
for God's sake.

02:14.735 --> 02:16.301
( clears throat )

02:20.207 --> 02:22.641
Robbie boy,
round up some drinks.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.443
I'll take them down
to our friends.

02:24.445 --> 02:27.579
- Nothing too strong, eh?
- Of course...

02:27.581 --> 02:29.281
James.

02:31.652 --> 02:35.254
I do hope that this
increase in circulation

02:35.256 --> 02:36.788
you appear to be preparing for

02:36.790 --> 02:39.591
won't cause a spike
in advertising prices.

02:44.532 --> 02:47.232
Two of my presses
have been drafted

02:47.234 --> 02:48.800
into service by the Royal Army.

02:48.802 --> 02:51.403
- Oh?
- We're making...

02:51.405 --> 02:54.306
Continentals.

02:54.308 --> 02:57.743
Those sacks were stuffed with paper
taken from the rebel's own supply.

02:57.745 --> 03:00.546
Philadelphia paper
with silk fibers

03:00.548 --> 03:02.414
and isinglass for the
real look and feel.

03:02.416 --> 03:05.350
André plans to flood
the rebel states with them.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.352
He'll devalue the currency.

03:07.354 --> 03:08.854
Yes, bankrupt the bastards.

03:08.856 --> 03:11.723
False Congress notes
for a false Congress, eh?

03:11.725 --> 03:13.592
( laughs )

03:20.467 --> 03:23.835
But for those lucky few
who get in on the action early,

03:23.837 --> 03:26.572
a fortune can be had.

03:26.574 --> 03:29.741
Let it never be said
that I don't pay your share

03:29.743 --> 03:31.610
in a timely manner, partner.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.781
There's little to do
with these inside York City.

03:35.783 --> 03:38.450
Even a boring Quaker
such as yourself

03:38.452 --> 03:40.619
has a friend or two
in the London trade.

03:41.789 --> 03:44.423
Fine, keep the bridle on.

03:44.425 --> 03:49.461
But my advice is spend these soon before
they're worth less than wallpaper.

03:49.463 --> 03:52.798
In that case...

03:52.800 --> 03:54.800
I'd like to buy

All right, raise this

- ( laughing )

head shot, Mrs. Woodhull.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.617
( horse whinnies )

05:54.021 --> 05:57.656
Someone must have
heard the shot.

05:57.658 --> 05:59.758
No, they're not here
to report our musket.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.027
- What?
- Restocking was going to be cumbersome,

06:02.029 --> 06:05.030
so I scheduled a delivery
to save some trouble.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.366
I wanted to surprise you.

06:11.138 --> 06:13.138
Come on, mister.

06:13.140 --> 06:16.007
Come on.
You can shoot one day.

06:16.009 --> 06:18.043
- When you're a little older.
- Did Mama do a good job?

06:18.045 --> 06:21.046
Your mama did do
a good job, didn't she?

06:21.048 --> 06:22.748
Blew his head off.

06:24.952 --> 06:27.586
What is it?
What's wrong?

06:27.588 --> 06:29.588
Ah!

06:30.958 --> 06:32.891
The ring?

06:34.728 --> 06:36.027
Here.

06:36.029 --> 06:37.629
See this here?

06:37.631 --> 06:40.632
This is the signal we use.

06:40.634 --> 06:42.734
You have to ride for Oyster Bay?

06:43.904 --> 06:46.138
Go.

06:46.140 --> 06:47.906
If anyone asks, I'll tell them

06:47.908 --> 06:50.442
you're bound for Stony Brook
to purchase more lumber.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.180
Mary.

06:55.182 --> 06:57.816
Go.

06:57.818 --> 06:59.738
You gonna help Mama
put these away?

07:01.989 --> 07:05.023
- ( chatter )
- ( horse whinnies )

07:09.630 --> 07:12.464

07:41.061 --> 07:43.028
- Like that, then?
- Well done, missy.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.863
Looks so fine, I'll have
you do the next four.

07:44.865 --> 07:47.132
Oh, whoa.
Hold up there, Sergeant.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.900
I'll take it from here.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.137
Might we have
a word, Mrs. Strong?

07:56.844 --> 07:58.243
How would you fancy a rest?

07:58.245 --> 08:00.178
- I don't mind the work.
- Caleb: Yeah?

08:00.180 --> 08:02.180
Give yourself
a once-over.

08:02.182 --> 08:04.749
You'll want to wipe the grime
off before you meet him.

08:04.751 --> 08:07.085
Meet who?

08:08.722 --> 08:09.888
( chuckles )

08:12.259 --> 08:14.993
General Washington.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.028
It's my pleasure to introduce

08:17.030 --> 08:19.064
Mrs. Anna Strong,

08:19.066 --> 08:20.966
the signal of Setauket.

08:25.939 --> 08:27.873
Madam.

08:29.776 --> 08:33.511
It is my great honor to
welcome you to this army

08:33.514 --> 08:37.215
that you have kept
alive and whole

08:37.217 --> 08:39.116
through your good works.

08:40.821 --> 08:43.020
On behalf of those
who will never know

08:43.023 --> 08:44.756
the true measure
of your efforts,

08:44.758 --> 08:46.892
I thank you for them

08:46.894 --> 08:50.862
and for all the sacrifices
you have made

08:50.864 --> 08:53.031
in the name of our cause.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.066
Thank you, sir.

08:55.068 --> 08:58.570
I... it has been
my pleasure.

09:00.307 --> 09:02.941
- ( crying )
- Anna.

09:05.779 --> 09:08.880
You... you credit me
too well, Your Excellency,

09:08.882 --> 09:11.116
but I hope you see my best
efforts are not behind me.

09:11.118 --> 09:14.185
It is my resolve, my hope

09:14.187 --> 09:16.321
that now from camp

09:16.323 --> 09:19.190
I can bring even more
value to the ring.

09:19.192 --> 09:21.826
- Anna, I...
- Having lived in Setauket,

09:21.828 --> 09:23.929
I know the difficulties
Culper faces.

09:23.931 --> 09:25.897
I can keep up with the
reports between him and us

09:25.899 --> 09:30.201
and clarify said reports
as needed.

09:30.203 --> 09:34.839
All of your efforts have been
greatly appreciated, madam.

09:38.812 --> 09:40.011
Anna.

09:41.848 --> 09:43.949
Come on.
Come on.

09:50.223 --> 09:51.756
What was that?

09:51.758 --> 09:53.258
You know, just
the commander-in-chief.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.093
Am I a camp follower now?

09:55.095 --> 09:57.095
Is that all I'm meant to do?

09:57.097 --> 10:00.031
Anna, women do not serve in
official capacity. You know this.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.267
Washington cannot enlist you.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.002
What did you expect him to say?

10:04.004 --> 10:05.971
( exhales )

10:05.973 --> 10:07.906
I...

10:16.016 --> 10:17.849
I know how you feel, Annie.

10:17.851 --> 10:19.017
- Do you?
- Yeah.

10:19.019 --> 10:21.987
Just let me talk to Ben, yeah?

10:21.989 --> 10:23.955
He's been out of sorts since
he got back from Jersey.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.824
I know.
He was wounded.

10:25.826 --> 10:27.292
I asked him about it,
but he just went quiet.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.294
Right, well, I'll get
him to talk, yeah?

10:29.296 --> 10:32.330
- And listen.
- Mm.

10:43.377 --> 10:46.878
<i>( bell tolling )</i>

10:50.183 --> 10:51.983
Grog.
Quick, now.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.218
It'll be a shilling.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.886
Ain't been paid yet.

10:54.888 --> 10:57.255
I could get you
some Continentals.

10:59.426 --> 11:02.894
You gentlemen have been
working away all night.

11:02.896 --> 11:05.196
Allow me to bring
you some Madeira.

11:05.198 --> 11:07.132
My compliments.

11:22.449 --> 11:25.050
<i>( men chatting )</i>

11:30.457 --> 11:33.091
André: <i>Listen up, gentlemen.
Pay attention.</i>

11:33.093 --> 11:35.894
<i>Once each of your detachments
has received their allotments,</i>

11:35.896 --> 11:38.930
assemble at the berth
of the ship Glencairn.

11:42.069 --> 11:44.069
Uh, told him we were thirsty.

11:44.071 --> 11:46.137
He said it were on the house.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.742
Much obliged.

11:53.480 --> 11:56.181
André: <i>The bills will be
ready by midday tomorrow</i>

11:56.183 --> 12:00.318
and the Glencairn will
sail promptly at 2:00.

12:00.320 --> 12:04.422
<i>Each of you 12 leaders must ensure
that your men are ready to go.</i>

12:04.424 --> 12:06.891
The Glencairn will take
you up the Hudson

12:06.893 --> 12:10.261
past our Fort Montgomery
to Con Hook,

12:10.263 --> 12:14.165
as close to Patriot territory as is
safe from their cannon at West Point.

12:14.167 --> 12:15.967
How many guns on the Glencairn?

12:15.969 --> 12:19.370
<i>20. But there shouldn't
be any need for them.</i>

12:19.372 --> 12:23.041
No one should be aware
of your presence.

12:23.043 --> 12:27.078
Thank you, Mr. Townsend,
for the refreshments.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.781
- ( groans )
- You are welcome, sir.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.284
Lieutenant Gamble will brief you

12:33.286 --> 12:36.988
<i>on where each group is to meet their
contacts in rebel-held territory.</i>

12:36.990 --> 12:39.023
Gamble:
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

12:39.025 --> 12:42.327
It'll be near nightfall by the
time we land at Con Hook.

12:42.329 --> 12:45.263
We've made arrangements to pump
the money into their economy

12:45.265 --> 12:47.465
<i>through bulk purchases.</i>

12:47.467 --> 12:50.769
<i>You men have been chosen based
on your previous trade contacts.</i>

12:50.771 --> 12:54.105
<i>When you head to your assigned
area, keep a low profile...</i>

12:54.107 --> 12:56.975
<i>( continues indistinctly )</i>

13:00.347 --> 13:02.080
Man:
<i>Fall in!</i>

13:02.082 --> 13:04.048
<i>Hup, ho!</i>

13:04.050 --> 13:07.452
<i>Attention!</i>

13:07.454 --> 13:09.988
Well, what do you think?

13:11.792 --> 13:16.361
This cart used to belong
to Nathaniel Sackett.

13:16.363 --> 13:18.196
He's the man who wrote
our code glossary.

13:18.198 --> 13:20.331
Did Caleb speak with you?

13:21.301 --> 13:23.268
Yes.
Yes, he did.

13:23.270 --> 13:26.271
He... he told me that
you didn't want to be seen

13:26.273 --> 13:29.507
as a mere camp follower
and I agreed.

13:29.509 --> 13:32.010
So this cart will set you apart

13:32.012 --> 13:34.379
from all the other doxie-delles who
are just here to find a husband.

13:34.381 --> 13:36.981
That's not what I...

13:36.983 --> 13:40.151
Ben, I want to help the ring.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.020
Our ring.

13:42.022 --> 13:44.289
Right, well, I'm afraid
that's not possible.

13:44.291 --> 13:47.325
- Why?
- It's too dangerous.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.294
What, here in camp?

13:49.296 --> 13:51.129
You've been away
from Setauket too long.

13:51.131 --> 13:52.463
All right,
just lower your voice.

13:52.465 --> 13:54.299
And don't point at me
like that, please.

13:54.301 --> 13:56.501
Oh, is that an order, Major?
I thought I wasn't enlisted.

13:56.503 --> 13:59.137
You know, you're here at the
pleasure of the commander,

13:59.139 --> 14:01.172
a privilege that can be
revoked at any time.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.408
Don't act like I don't know you.

14:03.410 --> 14:06.110
I used to hold your hand while
you cried from a bee sting.

14:06.112 --> 14:08.613
Yes, when I was eight years old.
I hadn't grown up yet.

14:08.615 --> 14:11.182
And I'm starting to think
that maybe you still haven't.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.451
Is that why you
don't believe I can help?

14:15.021 --> 14:18.122
Even though it was I
who recruited Abigail.

14:18.124 --> 14:22.427
And maintained contact with her while
the British were in Philadelphia.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.562
Did you even tell
Washington that?

14:25.866 --> 14:27.866
Or did you credit
yourself for it?

14:27.868 --> 14:29.367
Is that why you won't
advocate for me?

14:29.369 --> 14:31.536
Advocate for you?
Anna, I lied for you.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.239
- Lied for me?
- You tried to marry a British officer.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.174
Now, I know that doesn't
change what side you're on,

14:36.176 --> 14:37.375
but do you think
Washington knows that?

14:37.377 --> 14:39.210
He doesn't know you.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.079
What did you tell him?

14:42.515 --> 14:45.383
I...
( sighs )

14:45.385 --> 14:48.553
That there were whispers
of adultery with Culper

14:48.555 --> 14:51.422
and rather than implicate
him and the ring,

14:51.424 --> 14:54.359
you left Setauket
because of social shame.

14:56.529 --> 14:58.396
Look, I'm sorry.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.466
I... I had to explain your
leaving to him somehow.

15:04.371 --> 15:06.371
I see.

15:08.375 --> 15:11.576
So I'm to be a woman
shamed here as well.

15:11.578 --> 15:14.579
- You're not shamed.
- But I am a woman.

15:14.581 --> 15:17.448
Something fragile.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.317
Something to be protected.

15:21.388 --> 15:25.089
I just wish you had
a sister growing up, Ben.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.591
Or a wife.

15:26.593 --> 15:29.460
Or even a girl you loved.

15:29.462 --> 15:32.397
- Then you'd have a wider view of...
- All right, that's enough!

15:36.303 --> 15:39.704
Look, as I said, this cart
belonged to Nathaniel Sackett.

15:39.706 --> 15:42.707
He ended up dead because
this ring is dangerous

15:42.709 --> 15:45.710
even in camp even for a man.

15:45.712 --> 15:48.346
<i>- ( sheep bleating )
- ( dog barking )</i>

15:55.622 --> 15:57.288
Samuel:
<i>Morning, Mr. Rivington.</i>

15:57.290 --> 16:00.191
- ( clears throat )
- Ah, the elder Townsend!

16:00.193 --> 16:02.427
By any chance
have you seen my son?

16:02.429 --> 16:04.395
You know I haven't.

16:04.397 --> 16:07.231
He was covering
the shop last night

16:07.233 --> 16:09.233
and I hear it turned
into quite the late affair.

16:09.235 --> 16:11.502
I imagine he's having a bit
of a lie-in up in his room.

16:11.504 --> 16:12.737
Yes, all right.

16:12.739 --> 16:14.672
Well, I believe
I shall wake him.

16:14.674 --> 16:17.308
But what if he's not alone?

16:17.310 --> 16:19.610
What if he's
entertaining a lady?

16:19.612 --> 16:22.313
Or ladies?

16:30.256 --> 16:32.457
- James: <i>I'll walk you up.</i>
- Samuel: <i> I assure you...</i>

16:32.459 --> 16:34.099
James:
<i>No, no, no.</i>

16:39.666 --> 16:41.599
<i>( knocking )</i>

16:41.601 --> 16:43.668
One minute.

16:46.573 --> 16:48.706
( knocking )

16:50.176 --> 16:51.576
Mr. Rivington.

16:51.578 --> 16:54.612
Thank you for guiding...

16:57.450 --> 16:59.751
Hmm.

16:59.753 --> 17:02.320
( whistles )

17:02.322 --> 17:03.521
Hmm.

17:09.229 --> 17:11.496
Curious you're writing
on music paper.

17:11.498 --> 17:13.498
Yes, yes, it's a copy.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.366
Got it for Nelly, Father.

17:15.367 --> 17:18.636
It's a new piece composed
by an Austrian fellow.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.407
Naturally I will
be selling the original,

17:23.410 --> 17:26.711
but I thought that Nelly might
like to be the talk of the town

17:26.713 --> 17:29.380
playing something fresh
on her pianoforte.

17:29.382 --> 17:32.050
If she can find a violin partner.
It is a duet.

17:32.052 --> 17:34.285
That's wonderful.
She'll be so pleased.

17:34.287 --> 17:37.088
Perhaps she can come
visit one day.

17:38.258 --> 17:40.224
Nelly, eh?

17:40.226 --> 17:41.726
( chuckles )

17:41.728 --> 17:43.761
You rascal.

17:47.534 --> 17:51.335
( sighs )

17:51.337 --> 17:53.704
I told you he was
going to be a problem.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.740
Got his eye on you.

17:55.742 --> 17:58.443
And mine is on him.

17:58.445 --> 18:02.413
If I am caught, Rivington
will not be the one to do it.

18:02.415 --> 18:05.716
And if he discovers that
Nelly is the family dog?

18:05.718 --> 18:07.685
He likes a good joke.

18:07.687 --> 18:10.555
Now, time is of the
essence with this one.

18:10.557 --> 18:12.690
- Make sure that Culper knows that.
- Yes.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.533
Robert.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.435
Father, don't worry.

18:25.705 --> 18:28.573
I'm proud of you.

18:28.575 --> 18:30.708
I wanted to be sure
that you knew that.

18:33.746 --> 18:37.515
You know, it would be good to spend some
time with you away from all this business.

18:37.517 --> 18:41.752
Why don't you come home next week for
Thanksgiving dinner at the farm?

18:41.754 --> 18:43.688
- Thanksgiving?
- Yes.

18:43.690 --> 18:48.593
Why, Father, wouldn't that
be considered a holiday?

18:48.595 --> 18:51.362
So don't tell the other Quakers.

18:51.364 --> 18:53.331
I won't.

18:53.333 --> 18:56.367
And in any case,
there'll be turkey.

18:56.369 --> 18:58.336
Count me in.

18:59.305 --> 19:00.771
Ah.

19:00.773 --> 19:02.874
( clears throat )

19:11.818 --> 19:15.153
All right, Thomas, let's see
how fast Mama can do this.

19:47.820 --> 19:50.555
( horse snorts )

19:51.791 --> 19:54.792
Thomas, sweetheart, follow Mama.

20:01.601 --> 20:02.900
Come here.

20:04.971 --> 20:06.804
Welcome back, Captain.

20:06.806 --> 20:08.773
Thank you,
Mrs. Woodhull.

20:08.775 --> 20:12.677
May I suggest you take your son
and retreat into your home?

20:12.679 --> 20:14.696
Is there danger?

20:14.697 --> 20:16.714
Not if you stay clear
of the town and the garrison.

20:16.716 --> 20:19.784
In any case, it'll all
be settled by nightfall.

20:19.786 --> 20:21.719
Good day.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.434
<i>( door opens )</i>

20:40.773 --> 20:42.673
My little soldier.

20:42.675 --> 20:43.908
Come to Grandpapa.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.477
See, Thomas?
I told you he'd be home.

20:46.479 --> 20:48.713
What's the matter?

20:48.715 --> 20:49.947
- Father...
- Don't call me that.

20:49.949 --> 20:51.649
Please listen to me.

20:51.651 --> 20:54.485
Captain Simcoe has returned

20:54.487 --> 20:55.853
and he looks to be
in a violent mood.

20:55.855 --> 20:58.990
Well, best give him
a wide berth.

20:58.992 --> 21:02.827
I... I agree. I hope to do so.
I think we all should.

21:02.829 --> 21:05.029
I wanted you to know
of his return.

21:05.031 --> 21:07.531
You don't want me
to mention Abe.

21:07.533 --> 21:10.468
You don't want me to tell Captain
Simcoe that Abe is a spy.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.937
Nothing good can come of it. Think
of what happened with Hewlett.

21:12.939 --> 21:16.574
- Hewlett was weak.
- And Simcoe is evil.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.778
Does that concern
a man of the law?

21:20.780 --> 21:23.781
Does it concern you that you
would be sacrificing your son

21:23.783 --> 21:25.516
to the man who had you shot?

21:25.518 --> 21:28.552
What? Simcoe was standing
next to me when I was shot.

21:28.554 --> 21:30.888
Corporal Eastin shot you at
range under Simcoe's orders.

21:30.890 --> 21:33.791
And now Corporal Eastin
is dead by Abe's hand.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.693
<i>( hoofbeats approach )</i>

21:38.798 --> 21:42.800
Please. Please.
Please. Please.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.769
All right.

21:44.771 --> 21:48.005
I will stay silent
on one condition.

21:48.007 --> 21:51.942
Thomas stays with me. You willingly
give him over to my care.

21:53.713 --> 21:57.081
No. No.
Never.

22:00.653 --> 22:03.521
- Don't do this.
- Captain Simcoe.

22:08.561 --> 22:10.695
Thank you for watching him.

22:14.901 --> 22:17.968
I'll tell Aberdeen that it's
past time for his lunch.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.080
Am I interrupting?

22:29.082 --> 22:31.048
Not at all.

22:33.986 --> 22:37.355
Splendid for a boy to spend
time with his grandfather,

22:37.357 --> 22:40.658
though I do wish to speak
with you alone for a moment.

22:45.932 --> 22:48.899
I've just returned from
an unfortunate excursion

22:48.901 --> 22:51.936
to discover Major Hewlett
has fled us for kinder tides.

22:51.938 --> 22:54.705
That leaves only you and I
to discuss the matter

22:54.707 --> 22:56.941
of Hewlett's dealings
with Robert Rogers.

22:56.943 --> 22:58.609
What... what
do you mean, dealings?

22:58.611 --> 23:01.879
You play incompetent well
for a magistrate.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.849
It is clear they were
in league against me

23:04.851 --> 23:09.720
and it would not serve you well
to deny what you have seen

23:09.722 --> 23:14.425
either in passing or as
an active participant.

23:19.866 --> 23:23.067
I know of no collusion between
the two in any capacity.

23:23.069 --> 23:26.003
I would find
the notion ridiculous

23:26.005 --> 23:28.005
if I did not see
your belief in it.

23:28.007 --> 23:30.808
As for me, I cannot place
Hewlett with Rogers

23:30.810 --> 23:32.977
since the investigation
of Captain Joyce's murder.

23:32.979 --> 23:37.748
I do know that they
despised one another.

23:48.895 --> 23:52.596
I note you have a vacancy
here at Whitehall.

23:52.598 --> 23:54.732
As the ranking officer
in Setauket,

23:54.734 --> 23:57.435
it is fitting
for my headquarters.

23:57.437 --> 23:59.770
I shall take Hewlett's
room as my own.

24:01.207 --> 24:04.141
What will you do about Hewlett?

24:04.143 --> 24:06.844
Will you report him
to your superiors?

24:08.881 --> 24:11.182
Oh, I find such matters are
best handled face to face.

24:11.184 --> 24:12.750
He shouldn't be hard to find.

24:12.752 --> 24:15.753
His mercenary, however,

24:15.755 --> 24:17.788
is the immediate danger.

24:22.195 --> 24:24.228
<i>( door opens )</i>

24:24.230 --> 24:25.896
<i>( door closes )</i>

24:29.869 --> 24:32.803
Hello!

24:32.805 --> 24:35.206
Welcome back to Oyster Bay.

24:35.208 --> 24:38.809
I was trying to get my fields
turned under before winter.

24:38.811 --> 24:41.779
Huh, bit of a late start.

24:41.781 --> 24:43.647
Well, looks like you'll
be ready for spring, though.

24:43.649 --> 24:45.249
( laughs )
Yeah.

24:45.251 --> 24:49.053
Look, I'm sorry I won't
be able to stay long.

24:49.055 --> 24:51.722
Oh, yes, of course.

24:51.724 --> 24:53.858
Well, your timing is impeccable.

24:53.860 --> 24:56.060
- Oh?
- I just returned from York City

24:56.062 --> 24:57.661
not two hours ago.

24:57.663 --> 25:00.197
- Right over here.
- ( clears throat )

25:04.904 --> 25:08.672
Tell me, is everything all right

25:08.674 --> 25:10.708
back in Setauket?

25:10.710 --> 25:12.676
Yes, all...
all is well.

25:12.678 --> 25:14.178
Oh, good.
( chuckles )

25:14.180 --> 25:16.080
Because your friend Austin Roe

25:16.082 --> 25:18.782
made it sound
as if that was not so.

25:18.784 --> 25:22.186
He has a tendency to make things sound
more dramatic than they actually are.

25:22.188 --> 25:26.690
But, listen, it'll be me who comes
to see you from here on out.

25:26.692 --> 25:29.894
You won't be seeing
him ever again, so...

25:29.896 --> 25:31.862
Good.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.867
- Well, I'll be on my way.
- All right.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.903
- It was good to see you.
- Good.

25:41.240 --> 25:43.040
Abe.

25:45.845 --> 25:49.547
Robert will be here
at the farm for Thanksgiving.

25:49.549 --> 25:51.782
- Mm.
- Yes, I think it would be good

25:51.784 --> 25:55.185
if you two spoke again
and not through code.

25:55.187 --> 25:59.223
Why don't you and your family
join us for dinner, eh?

25:59.225 --> 26:03.727
Well, I'll see
what the wife says.

26:03.729 --> 26:05.896
- Do that.
- <i>Okay.</i>

26:05.898 --> 26:07.865
- Good day.
- Good day.

26:09.235 --> 26:11.135
Hyah.

- Man: Yeah, here's good.
- ( men grunt )

26:46.072 --> 26:47.371
Don't put that there.

26:47.373 --> 26:50.274
It's captain's orders.

26:50.276 --> 26:53.277
I've chosen this room
as my new office.

26:53.279 --> 26:55.159
I trust that won't be a problem.

27:00.186 --> 27:02.252
Business must be going well.

27:02.254 --> 27:04.355
These numbers are high.

27:04.357 --> 27:08.158
Later, you and I should discuss the
opportunities around Setauket.

27:08.160 --> 27:11.395
There must be some service I can offer
in place of Hewlett's old partnership.

27:11.397 --> 27:13.197
We were never partners.

27:13.199 --> 27:16.000
Though he did allow you
to keep your pistol

27:16.002 --> 27:18.969
even though all firearms were
to be turned into the garrison.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.337
It was just for protection.

27:20.339 --> 27:23.407
I'm all the protection
this town requires.

27:29.248 --> 27:32.316
In the future,
I would appreciate

27:32.318 --> 27:35.686
you requesting permission
before entering my office.

27:44.897 --> 27:46.130
Robert's voice:
<i>"Dear Mr. Culper,</i>

All right, men, you know where
to meet your distributors.

28:24.203 --> 28:26.370
Move out.

28:26.372 --> 28:28.706
Townsend's voice: <i>"Hopefully
this news will reach him in time</i>

28:28.708 --> 28:31.909
<i>to cut off the ship
and disrupt this plot."</i>

28:42.888 --> 28:47.091
( indistinct dialogue )

28:47.093 --> 28:49.293
I had no choice.
Simcoe was right there

28:49.295 --> 28:51.295
and your father was...
where are you going?

28:51.297 --> 28:53.497
- To get my pistol and get our son.
- No, no.

28:53.499 --> 28:56.033
- Abe, stop!
- Mary, stop.

28:56.035 --> 28:59.002
- No, Abe.
- Mary, get off the door.

28:59.004 --> 29:01.004
- Just think.
- I set up Simcoe!

29:01.006 --> 29:03.240
He was supposed to die in an
ambush on the coast, all right?

29:03.242 --> 29:05.275
Now he's alive, he's back
here, he's looking for me.

29:05.277 --> 29:07.377
And you've left
our son with him.

29:07.379 --> 29:09.313
Get off the door.

29:12.351 --> 29:15.018
He doesn't know
you're involved, Abe.

29:15.020 --> 29:17.354
Abe, listen.

29:17.356 --> 29:20.324
If Simcoe knew that you were involved,
he wouldn't have let me leave Whitehall.

29:20.326 --> 29:22.326
Where's my damn pistol?

29:22.328 --> 29:24.762
- Damn it!
- Abe, look at me. Look at me.

29:24.764 --> 29:27.331
If you go storming in there with a
pistol, he will know something is wrong.

29:27.333 --> 29:29.199
We need to get Thomas back, yes,

29:29.201 --> 29:32.770
but we need to think
and we need to plan.

29:32.772 --> 29:34.732
He doesn't know
that you're involved.

29:37.009 --> 29:39.009
- <i>( pistol cocks )</i>
- ( gasps )

29:41.113 --> 29:43.180
How many times have I
told you to be more aware

29:43.182 --> 29:45.115
of your surroundings, boy?

29:45.117 --> 29:47.017
It's all right. It's all right.
I know him.

29:47.019 --> 29:49.353
This must be
Mrs. Cabbage Farmer.

29:52.124 --> 29:53.524
What the hell happened to you?

29:53.526 --> 29:57.227
Your friend Brewster
needed saving, so I saved him.

29:57.229 --> 29:59.463
And now those bastards
know I'm here

29:59.465 --> 30:01.999
and they're tracking me down
like a wild animal.

30:02.001 --> 30:05.369
- So you lead them back here?
- You owe me!

30:05.371 --> 30:08.205
I took a patch of leather
for my eye.

30:08.207 --> 30:11.809
And now I'll be needing the
intelligence from your man in the city.

30:11.811 --> 30:13.443
I've already dropped the letter.
It's gone.

30:13.445 --> 30:16.146
What did it say?

30:16.148 --> 30:17.581
Look, can we just
lower the pistol?

30:17.583 --> 30:20.017
You tell me what it said.

30:20.019 --> 30:23.187
Major André is flooding Patriot lands
with thousands of counterfeit bills.

30:23.189 --> 30:25.155
Sounds just like André.

30:25.157 --> 30:27.825
Using money as a weapon.

30:27.827 --> 30:30.060
Is he crossing
the lines himself?

30:30.062 --> 30:31.995
No, he's sending men.
Shovers.

30:31.997 --> 30:33.530
- What else?
- Nothing.

30:33.532 --> 30:35.599
- What else?
- Nothing else.

30:35.601 --> 30:38.335
- Just little observations, that's it.
- Observations?

30:38.337 --> 30:41.471
Something about Major André
being down in the mouth

30:41.473 --> 30:43.473
over a woman or something.

30:45.244 --> 30:47.010
A woman?

30:47.012 --> 30:48.178
Yeah, it was just
an observation.

30:48.180 --> 30:49.413
He puts them
at the bottom sometimes.

30:49.415 --> 30:51.615
No, Woodhull, no.

30:51.617 --> 30:53.317
This is the key.

30:53.319 --> 30:57.287
This is the heel
of old Achilles himself.

30:57.289 --> 30:59.423
You understand?
Hmm?

30:59.425 --> 31:01.458
You had one in Philly,
too, didn't you?

31:01.460 --> 31:04.027
What was her name?
What was her name?

31:04.029 --> 31:06.396
It didn't say.
It didn't say a name.

31:06.398 --> 31:08.398
Guess I'll have
to ask him myself.

31:08.400 --> 31:10.534
No. No.

31:10.536 --> 31:13.303
No, just...
no, wait!

31:13.305 --> 31:15.539
Come back.
Would you just... please?

31:15.541 --> 31:17.474
You can't talk to Townsend.

31:17.476 --> 31:19.109
- He's in New York.
- That's where I'm going.

31:19.111 --> 31:20.444
You don't know
this man, all right?

31:20.446 --> 31:23.247
He is not like his father.
He scares easily.

31:23.249 --> 31:25.148
He's got nothing
to be afraid of from me.

31:25.150 --> 31:26.483
I'm just gonna ask him
a few questions.

31:26.485 --> 31:29.586
Just let me ask them.
Let me ask, all right?

31:29.588 --> 31:32.189
How are you going to get
into New York, boy?

31:32.191 --> 31:34.124
I won't have to. He's coming to
Oyster Bay for Thanksgiving.

31:34.126 --> 31:35.425
He's invited me
to join, all right?

31:35.427 --> 31:36.660
I can find out everything
you need to know

31:36.662 --> 31:39.096
about that woman, about André.

31:39.098 --> 31:41.098
Everything that you need to know,
just let me ask the questions.

31:41.100 --> 31:43.233
- Thanksgiving, eh?
- Yeah.

31:43.235 --> 31:44.668
That's right soon.

31:44.670 --> 31:46.403
Best be on my way

31:46.405 --> 31:48.538
if I want to make it
in time for dinner, eh?

31:48.540 --> 31:50.140
I'm very hungry.

31:53.345 --> 31:55.545
Abe! Abe!

31:55.547 --> 31:58.081
<i>I like you, boy.</i>

31:58.083 --> 32:01.084
And that's why I'm not
going to kill you.

32:01.086 --> 32:05.222
But we will never see
each other again.

32:06.358 --> 32:07.591
No!

32:07.593 --> 32:09.159
<i>No!</i>

32:12.264 --> 32:13.363
( grunting )

32:19.104 --> 32:21.438
<i>( chatter )</i>

32:49.268 --> 32:51.568
( crying )

32:54.306 --> 32:57.207
<i>( chatter )</i>

32:57.209 --> 32:58.542
According to Culper Jr.'s
intelligence,

32:58.544 --> 33:00.711
the Glencairn
has already made landfall

33:00.713 --> 33:05.315
and its shovers have dispersed
with their poison dollars.

33:05.317 --> 33:08.652
<i>We received this news too late.</i>

33:08.654 --> 33:12.222
But, sir, we may still be able to
find them through their contacts.

33:12.224 --> 33:14.358
But even he doesn't know
where they're heading.

33:14.360 --> 33:18.161
Well, sir, we could start in Con
Hook and look for their tracks.

33:18.163 --> 33:19.663
- Tracks?
- Right.

33:19.665 --> 33:21.498
- You're dismissed.
- Sir, if you'll just allow...

33:21.500 --> 33:22.699
Both of you.

33:30.376 --> 33:33.577
Tall-boy, I'm sorry. I got to the
drop and back as quick as I could.

33:33.579 --> 33:37.180
No, don't apologize. You got it
here safely and it's a good lead.

33:37.182 --> 33:39.850
Yeah, just too late
to matter, right?

33:39.851 --> 33:42.519
Now do you really think that you could
track the shovers from Con Hook?

33:42.521 --> 33:44.254
No, they'll likely take boats.

33:44.256 --> 33:45.422
Any other ideas?

34:00.372 --> 34:02.572
If they've already landed,
what'll you do?

34:02.574 --> 34:05.609
We've as much clue
as a horse's arse.

34:05.611 --> 34:09.646
Right, but we were hoping you might
have a different perspective

34:09.648 --> 34:12.549
seeing as you've been in enemy
territory longer than either of us.

34:14.286 --> 34:16.520
Well, I've been thinking about

34:16.522 --> 34:19.623
where the shovers
would do their shoving.

34:19.625 --> 34:21.391
If they have all
this money to unload,

34:21.393 --> 34:23.659
they can't just spend it
at some general store.

34:23.661 --> 34:26.530
They'd need someone who could take
thousands in one go and spend it fast.

34:26.532 --> 34:29.433
Well, loyal Tories, right?
I mean, they could spend it,

34:29.435 --> 34:31.301
but they'd have
to do it over time.

34:31.303 --> 34:33.536
No. No, too slow. The British
need a flood, not a trickle.

34:33.539 --> 34:35.772
When Maarten DeJong
bought Selah's tavern,

34:35.774 --> 34:39.309
he switched to buying
cheap rum from privateers,

34:39.311 --> 34:43.413
so Patriot privateers have access
to our lands and waterways.

34:43.415 --> 34:45.614
They trade on the black
market with anyone

34:45.617 --> 34:48.518
<i>and might be greedy enough
not to ask questions</i>

34:48.520 --> 34:50.480
about who they're
selling to or why.

34:53.625 --> 34:55.324
Christ.

34:55.327 --> 34:56.626
<i>She's...
she's got it, Ben.</i>

34:56.628 --> 34:59.529
She got it.

34:59.531 --> 35:01.865
- You got it.
- ( laughs )

35:01.867 --> 35:04.768
All right, last week I heard
a couple of whipjackets

35:04.770 --> 35:06.503
who do business
in Moodna Creek, right?

35:06.505 --> 35:09.439
They closed their shop. They
stopped selling.

35:09.441 --> 35:11.475
They pulled all their tobacco
off the London trade.

35:11.477 --> 35:13.510
- They pulled all of it.
- Wait, how much did they have?

35:13.512 --> 35:15.579
A shit ton, give or take.

35:15.581 --> 35:17.647
But the only reason they'd take
their inventory off market

35:17.649 --> 35:21.284
is if they thought they had someone
who could buy it all, right?

35:21.286 --> 35:22.452
- Right.
- One big sale.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.488
Yeah.

35:24.490 --> 35:26.556
- Well, do you know where their hideout is?
- Yeah.

35:26.558 --> 35:28.391
Well, what are you waiting for?

35:28.393 --> 35:30.160
Give 'em hell!

35:36.468 --> 35:39.669
- <i>( crickets chirping )</i>
- ( water sloshing )

35:39.671 --> 35:42.339
I didn't agree to hold all my
sales for this ridiculous price.

35:42.341 --> 35:45.342
Perhaps if you had neglected
just a few of your many whores,

35:45.344 --> 35:47.577
you might be able to meet
our confirmed amount.

35:47.579 --> 35:49.779
If it's as good as you say it
is, you'll get your price.

36:06.532 --> 36:10.534
You know, if we're lucky, they'll just
shoot each other and we can grab the cash.

36:10.536 --> 36:13.937
No, no, Sobel is a Patriot.
He'll fall in line with us.

36:13.939 --> 36:16.506
He might even know where
the other 11 teams have gone.

36:16.508 --> 36:20.210
<i>Six shovers, six privateers...</i>

36:22.347 --> 36:24.681
and six of us.

36:24.683 --> 36:26.683
No matter what else happens,

36:26.685 --> 36:28.552
the money gets burned.

36:36.495 --> 36:37.861
You got wood chips
mixed in here.

36:37.863 --> 36:40.430
That's half the product,
half the amount.

36:40.432 --> 36:43.767
Bollocks. It's pure and I was promised
double value for the whole load.

36:43.769 --> 36:45.969
I won't trade for less.

36:45.971 --> 36:48.371
Take it back, boys.
No sale.

36:48.373 --> 36:50.807
Wait.

36:53.545 --> 36:55.812
Here.

36:55.814 --> 36:58.515
The agreed 10,000.

37:01.853 --> 37:03.687
What... no, no.
Not yet.

37:03.689 --> 37:05.822
Are you kidding me?
He killed Sackett.

37:05.824 --> 37:08.225
I know.
Gamble is André's man.

37:08.227 --> 37:10.694
He likely knows where the
other shover teams have gone.

37:10.696 --> 37:13.697
We find them, we can recover
all the counterfeit dollars.

37:13.699 --> 37:16.733
- All right.
- Then we avenge Sackett.

37:16.735 --> 37:18.868
- All right?
- Good.

37:18.870 --> 37:21.771
I apologize for my man.

37:21.773 --> 37:24.574
He was under my orders
to drive you down.

37:25.811 --> 37:27.444
( spits )

37:27.446 --> 37:30.780
I see now there's
no fooling you.

37:30.782 --> 37:33.950
Let's light up that cash before
they have a chance to split it up.

37:33.952 --> 37:36.586
( speaking Oneida )

37:36.588 --> 37:37.954
Aye.

37:45.030 --> 37:46.896
Patriots, with us!

37:46.898 --> 37:49.666
Those are British
counterfeiters!

37:49.668 --> 37:52.936
( men shouting )

37:52.938 --> 37:55.805
Ben:
Spare their leader!

37:55.807 --> 37:57.707
Fire!

38:05.817 --> 38:07.617
Agh!

38:09.454 --> 38:10.887
( screams )

38:20.866 --> 38:22.666
- ( shouts )
- Agh!

38:28.774 --> 38:32.676
Where are the other shovers?

38:32.678 --> 38:36.880
- Where are they?!
- Are you sure I can't buy you off?

38:42.988 --> 38:45.755
( shouts )
Where are the others?!

38:45.757 --> 38:48.525
( gurgles )

38:52.898 --> 38:55.332
Caleb:
<i>Ben, he's gone.</i>

38:59.671 --> 39:01.538
Ben:
<i>Finish him.</i>

39:01.540 --> 39:02.872
Nathaniel Sackett.

39:02.874 --> 39:05.008

39:08.080 --> 39:10.680
<i>( banging )</i>

39:10.682 --> 39:12.749
( grunting )

39:13.985 --> 39:15.852
Mary, I can use some help here.

39:18.857 --> 39:21.991
I have to stop him before he gets to
Townsend's. We have to get out of here.

39:21.993 --> 39:25.562
I help you when you want it, then you
keep me in the dark the rest of the time.

39:27.566 --> 39:29.866
You didn't think Rogers
sneaking around the farm

39:29.868 --> 39:32.969
with Thomas nearby was worth
mentioning to me earlier?

39:32.971 --> 39:35.839
Or that you were setting an
ambush for Simcoe with Hewlett?

39:35.841 --> 39:38.641
- Mary, please.
- I'm not saying that you had a choice.

39:38.643 --> 39:41.845
But I never would have let Thomas
near Simcoe if I had known.

39:41.847 --> 39:44.047
Tell me what is going on.

39:44.049 --> 39:45.882
All of it.
Then I can help you

39:45.884 --> 39:47.684
figure out what to do
just as good as you.

39:47.686 --> 39:49.886
I agree. I agree
with you, all right?

39:49.888 --> 39:52.021
But you have to understand,
I did it for your protection.

39:52.023 --> 39:54.124
- That's ridiculous.
- I know it was wrong.

39:54.126 --> 39:56.393
It was the wrong thing to do and
I won't do it again, all right?

39:56.395 --> 39:58.728
From now on,
you will know everything,

39:58.730 --> 40:00.864
but right now it's about
that cellar door.

40:03.068 --> 40:06.035
What happens if you manage to
catch up to Robert Rogers?

40:06.037 --> 40:07.637
He'll kill you.

40:07.639 --> 40:09.706
Well, I said I had to stop him,

40:09.708 --> 40:13.176
but I didn't say I was planning
on catching up to him.

40:15.814 --> 40:18.448

Or was it this?

41:16.041 --> 41:18.641
Queen's Rangers
have settled in the town

41:18.643 --> 41:20.210
and are in open conflict
with the regulars

41:20.212 --> 41:22.912
led by the brutal
and now unchecked

41:22.914 --> 41:25.715
Captain John Graves Simcoe.

41:25.717 --> 41:28.852
I warn you most solemnly
that..."

41:28.854 --> 41:31.521
It appears you were interrupted
here and never got to finish.

41:34.726 --> 41:36.960
Perhaps the letter
is out of context.

41:36.962 --> 41:39.963
I'd hate for needless
strife to be churned up

41:39.965 --> 41:42.198
by sending such
a thing filled with

41:42.200 --> 41:44.834
unsubstantiated claims.

41:44.836 --> 41:47.837
What is not in that letter yet

41:47.839 --> 41:50.673
is that I know
that you ordered me shot.

41:50.675 --> 41:53.710
Careful, Magistrate.

41:53.712 --> 41:57.514
The command to fire is an
easy one in time of war.

41:57.516 --> 42:01.751
I would loathe for Setauket
to lose such a wise man.

42:01.753 --> 42:03.820
<i>( door opens )</i>

42:05.023 --> 42:07.857
Father, we've just been robbed.

42:07.859 --> 42:10.026
Up at the farm.

42:10.028 --> 42:12.729
Captain Simcoe, if your men make a
start now, you may just catch him.

42:12.731 --> 42:14.197
But I warn you,
please be careful.

42:14.199 --> 42:15.865
He's wounded, but he's fierce.

42:15.867 --> 42:18.201
Slow down, Woodhull.
Who robbed you?

42:18.203 --> 42:20.203
Well, you're not
gonna believe it,

42:20.205 --> 42:22.972
but it was Robert Rogers.

42:25.110 --> 42:27.544
Which way did he run?

42:32.017 --> 42:34.918
