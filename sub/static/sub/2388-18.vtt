WEBVTT

00:06.702 --> 00:08.558
MARSHALL:
<i>This is the life.</i>

00:08.559 --> 00:09.922
We got the three B's.

00:09.923 --> 00:12.774
Beach, booze
and bodacious babes.

00:12.776 --> 00:14.309
I don't know.

00:14.311 --> 00:16.311
I'm starting to think
we should call the police.

00:16.312 --> 00:17.979
Oh, would you relax?

00:17.981 --> 00:19.513
We've got it made.

00:19.515 --> 00:21.616
One whole week
at his bodacious beach house,

00:21.618 --> 00:23.968
no strings attached.

00:23.970 --> 00:26.955
Well, there is one
string attached.

00:28.857 --> 00:30.775
Hi, Barney.

00:38.050 --> 00:40.969
BOTH:
Bodacious.

00:40.971 --> 00:42.670
(gasps)
"Weekend at Barney's!"

00:42.672 --> 00:44.005
What is it? What's wrong?

00:44.007 --> 00:46.424
The plays, Robin, the plays.

00:46.426 --> 00:48.926
The ingenious techniques I used
as a bachelor

00:48.928 --> 00:50.645
to pick up busty dullards.

00:50.647 --> 00:52.930
They just keep coming to me;
I can't turn them off.

00:52.932 --> 00:55.400
Okay, Barney, let me
ease your mind, okay?

00:55.402 --> 00:56.934
All right, here we go.

00:56.936 --> 00:58.152
Remember when you set

00:58.154 --> 01:00.188
your Playbook on fire?

01:05.694 --> 01:08.997
That was the moment I realized
you were someone I could marry.

01:08.999 --> 01:11.616
And I'd burn it again
if I could.

01:11.618 --> 01:12.800
You're right.

01:12.802 --> 01:14.085
I'm done with all these plays.

01:14.087 --> 01:16.204
Besides, there's no way
I'll ever come up

01:16.206 --> 01:18.873
with anything that tops
"Weekend at Barney's."

01:18.875 --> 01:20.875
(chuckles)

01:25.714 --> 01:27.181
"Weekend at Barney's Two!"

01:27.183 --> 01:29.280
Damn it, Barney!

01:42.231 --> 01:44.115
So, there's this big

01:44.117 --> 01:45.766
gallery opening tonight.

01:45.768 --> 01:49.037
Oh, we'd love to, but
we've got this, um...

01:49.039 --> 01:50.621
Genesis reunion,
Madison Square Garden,

01:50.623 --> 01:51.772
front row.

01:51.774 --> 01:52.940
It's gonna be legend...

01:52.942 --> 01:54.042
I wasn't inviting you guys.

01:54.044 --> 01:56.961
Oh, thank God.
There is no concert.

01:56.963 --> 01:58.612
As the captain's
new art buyer,

01:58.614 --> 02:01.299
I have to go schmooze
this up-and-coming artist,

02:01.301 --> 02:02.633
Strickland Stevens,

02:02.635 --> 02:05.219
so we get first dibs
on all his new stuff.

02:05.221 --> 02:06.888
And I'll be helping
Lily seal the deal

02:06.890 --> 02:08.622
by impressing
the intelligentsia

02:08.624 --> 02:10.291
with some art-related
hilarity.

02:10.293 --> 02:12.793
I've prepared some jokes.

02:12.795 --> 02:15.763
Why couldn't the art
dealer pay his rent?

02:15.765 --> 02:16.814
I don't know. Why?

02:16.816 --> 02:18.132
This is gonna be rough.

02:18.134 --> 02:21.352
Because he ran
out of Monet.

02:21.354 --> 02:22.437
You're gonna get that

02:22.439 --> 02:24.439
on the walk home.
How about this one?

02:24.441 --> 02:26.357
You know what, we'd...
we'd love to hear it,

02:26.359 --> 02:27.992
but we've got that,
um... that...

02:27.994 --> 02:30.278
Steely Dan, Carnegie Hall,
backstage pass. Let's go.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.271
We don't want to miss
whatever their big song was.

02:32.296 --> 02:32.748
Yeah.

02:32.749 --> 02:35.649
Your wedding response card,
as promised.

02:35.651 --> 02:38.119
Why didn't you just mail
it like everybody else?

02:38.121 --> 02:40.438
Oh, see, that's sad, Robin.

02:40.440 --> 02:42.874
You should be touched
that I hand-delivered it.

02:42.876 --> 02:47.261
Has social media so eroded
our interpersonal relationships

02:47.263 --> 02:48.930
that we no longer wish
to experience the...

02:48.932 --> 02:50.014
You wanted to
keep the stamp?

02:50.016 --> 02:51.099
They're 46 cents now.

02:51.101 --> 02:52.133
It's getting out of hand.

02:52.135 --> 02:55.720
"Your invitation
is joyfully accepted

02:55.722 --> 02:58.856
by Mr. Ted Mosby and Jeanette""

02:58.858 --> 03:00.208
(groaning)

03:00.210 --> 03:01.642
NARRATOR:
<i>Kids, as you'll recall,</i>

03:01.644 --> 03:02.977
<i>Jeanette was</i>
<i>the last girl I dated</i>

03:02.979 --> 03:04.028
<i>before I met your mother.</i>

03:04.030 --> 03:05.062
<i>My friends only had</i>

03:05.064 --> 03:06.347
<i>one tiny problem with her.</i>

03:06.349 --> 03:07.615
(alarm buzzing)

03:08.317 --> 03:10.351
<i>She was nuts.</i>

03:11.320 --> 03:13.070
So you're bringing
a plus one?

03:13.072 --> 03:14.789
If you count the
voices in her head,

03:14.791 --> 03:16.240
it's plus five.

03:16.242 --> 03:17.925
Guys, I'm bringing her,

03:17.927 --> 03:19.827
and you're gonna love
having her there.

03:19.829 --> 03:21.662
Oh, and, um, by the way,

03:21.664 --> 03:23.548
just so this doesn't turn
into an argument later,

03:23.550 --> 03:24.715
the dress she's gonna wear

03:24.717 --> 03:26.237
isn't technically white;
it's eggshell.

03:26.819 --> 03:28.803
The shoes are white, though.

03:29.421 --> 03:30.755
And the gloves.

03:30.757 --> 03:32.840
And the veil.
Well, see you guys.

03:33.458 --> 03:35.276
No, no, no.
Mosby! Get...

03:38.897 --> 03:40.681
Oh, my God, what happened?

03:40.683 --> 03:42.883
Oh, I trashed your apartment.

03:42.885 --> 03:44.101
See, I got bored,

03:44.103 --> 03:46.437
so I started going
through all your e-mails.

03:46.439 --> 03:48.856
Sure.
And I found one from a woman

03:48.858 --> 03:51.075
with the subject line,
"big penis orgasms,"

03:51.077 --> 03:53.077
so naturally,
I smashed your plates,

03:53.079 --> 03:54.895
knifed your mattress,
peed in your drawers,

03:54.897 --> 03:56.814
the whole nine, but then,

03:56.816 --> 03:58.899
while I was upper-decking
your toilet,

03:58.901 --> 04:00.701
I actually read the e-mail.

04:00.703 --> 04:03.087
Turns out it was spam.

04:03.839 --> 04:05.540
Classic Jeanette, huh?

04:05.542 --> 04:07.341
Oh, my God.

04:07.343 --> 04:10.595
You are certifiably insane...

04:11.680 --> 04:13.014
...about me.

04:13.016 --> 04:14.549
Come here, you knucklehead.

04:14.551 --> 04:15.850
I can't stay mad at you.

04:15.852 --> 04:17.418
Ted, Ted,
I'm breaking up with you.

04:17.420 --> 04:18.435
You're just

04:18.438 --> 04:19.753
so intense,

04:19.755 --> 04:22.106
and it's all moving
way too fast.

04:22.108 --> 04:23.357
Here's your key back.

04:24.259 --> 04:25.759
I never gave you a key.

04:25.761 --> 04:27.612
And here's
your grandmother's ring.

04:27.614 --> 04:30.064
She was buried wearing this.

04:30.066 --> 04:31.949
<i>And just like that,</i>

04:31.951 --> 04:33.351
it was over.

04:34.419 --> 04:35.453
I texted Barney and Robin.

04:35.455 --> 04:36.604
I'm sure they're over the moon

04:36.606 --> 04:37.738
that Jeanette's not coming
to the wedding.

04:37.740 --> 04:40.374
Oh, no, Ted, no.

04:40.376 --> 04:43.411
They're not gonna be
happy about you being sad.

04:43.413 --> 04:44.879
They broke up!

04:44.881 --> 04:46.780
(screaming)

04:46.782 --> 04:48.382
Ted, respectfully,

04:48.384 --> 04:51.052
are you sure that this was
the right girl for you?

04:51.054 --> 04:52.336
Of course not.

04:52.338 --> 04:53.838
She was crazy.

04:53.840 --> 04:55.673
Absolutely a nightmare.

04:55.675 --> 04:57.124
It's totally not worth
the trouble.

04:57.126 --> 04:58.959
I mean, no matter how...

04:58.961 --> 05:01.646
no matter how great the sex was.

05:01.648 --> 05:03.748
Uh-oh.
Stay with us, buddy.

05:03.750 --> 05:06.434
No matter how hot and passionate

05:06.436 --> 05:08.736
and surprising,

05:08.738 --> 05:10.438
possibly illegal...

05:10.440 --> 05:12.540
I don't like this.
Me, neither.

05:12.542 --> 05:14.575
I'm gonna win her back.

05:14.577 --> 05:16.327
(groaning)

05:16.329 --> 05:19.080
Barney and Robin are gonna be
so happy I'm happy.

05:19.082 --> 05:21.032
(sobbing)
I know.

05:21.034 --> 05:23.618
I know.

05:23.620 --> 05:26.420
Did you just unhook my bra?

05:26.422 --> 05:28.789
Shh. There, there.

05:28.791 --> 05:31.158
NARRATOR: <i>That night was</i>
<i>the big gallery show.</i>

05:31.160 --> 05:33.010
Hey. I'm so sorry.

05:33.012 --> 05:34.934
I decided to grab a snack
from the bodega.

05:34.959 --> 05:35.597
Why?

05:35.598 --> 05:36.797
They'll have food
at the gallery.

05:36.799 --> 05:38.382
Oh, come on,
these places never have food.

05:38.384 --> 05:39.467
It's fine.

05:39.469 --> 05:41.001
I got some Skittles.

05:41.003 --> 05:44.355
NARRATOR: <i>That was the last bag</i>
<i>of Skittles</i>

05:44.357 --> 05:46.691
<i>your Uncle Marshall</i>
<i>would ever buy.</i>

05:46.693 --> 05:49.894
<i>Meanwhile, I headed over</i>
<i>to Jeanette's place</i>

05:49.896 --> 05:52.146
<i>to win her back.</i>
(bell dings)

05:52.148 --> 05:54.348
(doors close)

05:58.520 --> 06:00.237
What the hell?

06:00.239 --> 06:01.739
I can't let you do this, Ted.

06:01.741 --> 06:03.524
I want Jeanette back.

06:03.526 --> 06:05.743
Well, then accept my apology.

06:05.745 --> 06:07.378
For what?

06:07.380 --> 06:09.246
(sighs)
This.

06:13.848 --> 06:16.930
Ow, ow, ow! Damn it!
You're strong.

06:17.030 --> 06:18.563
That's just from Pilates?

06:18.565 --> 06:19.931
Twice a week.

06:19.933 --> 06:22.567
Look, I don't want you
getting back with Jeanette.

06:22.569 --> 06:25.153
Ted, what is my one rule?

06:25.155 --> 06:27.055
You can tell how old a girl is
by her elbows?

06:27.057 --> 06:28.323
My other one rule.

06:28.325 --> 06:30.075
Flaxseed relieves upset stomach?

06:30.077 --> 06:31.275
My other one rule.

06:31.277 --> 06:32.660
Always have a fake pair
of concert tickets

06:32.662 --> 06:34.679
in your pocket in case Lily
invites you to something stupid?

06:34.681 --> 06:35.767
My other one rule.

06:35.792 --> 06:37.600
Lebanese girls sprint to third
base and then stay there?

06:37.601 --> 06:39.601
My other one rule.
New is always better.

06:39.603 --> 06:40.969
New is always better!

06:40.971 --> 06:42.470
Exactly, Ted.

06:42.472 --> 06:44.389
You want to invite a date
to our wedding,

06:44.391 --> 06:45.924
it is not gonna be Jeanette.

06:45.926 --> 06:47.625
It is gonna be someone new.

06:47.627 --> 06:49.894
And I am gonna help you
find her

06:49.896 --> 06:52.180
with a little help from...

06:53.132 --> 06:54.182
The Playbook.

06:54.184 --> 06:55.400
The Playbook?

06:55.402 --> 06:56.518
Didn't you burn that?

06:56.520 --> 06:58.353
Oh, I didn't burn the real one.

06:58.355 --> 07:00.772
That was
the ceremonial playbook

07:00.774 --> 07:02.190
for parades,

07:02.192 --> 07:03.358
mall openings,

07:03.360 --> 07:04.776
inaugurations, stuff like that.

07:04.778 --> 07:06.744
That's a pretty big secret
to keep from Robin.

07:06.746 --> 07:08.830
Which is exactly
why I'm trusting you,

07:08.832 --> 07:11.166
my best bro,
to never let her know

07:11.168 --> 07:13.034
that the Playbook still exists.

07:13.485 --> 07:15.319
Pinky swear?

07:16.155 --> 07:17.922
Fine.

07:17.924 --> 07:19.624
Wow.

07:21.594 --> 07:23.327
See, I told you.

07:23.329 --> 07:26.464
Thank God I snuck in
this bag of goodness.

07:27.883 --> 07:30.435
(gasps)
There's Strickland Stevens.

07:30.437 --> 07:31.836
MARSHALL:
Wow.

07:31.838 --> 07:33.688
Even his scarf
is up-and-coming.

07:33.690 --> 07:37.358
Are you gonna be okay
by yourself for a few minutes?

07:37.360 --> 07:39.110
Yeah, of course.
Why wouldn't I be?

07:39.112 --> 07:42.147
Well, you're sitting
on an $80,000 sculpture.

07:42.149 --> 07:43.982
For 80 grand,

07:43.984 --> 07:45.867
you'd think it
would be more comfortable.

07:45.869 --> 07:47.402
Lil, I'll be fine.

07:47.404 --> 07:49.537
Do you know
who you're talking to?

07:49.539 --> 07:51.906
In high school,
I was voted most outgoing

07:51.908 --> 07:54.159
freshman, sophomore
and senior year.

07:54.161 --> 07:56.044
What happened junior year?

07:57.379 --> 07:59.197
<i>Egdud Ferhaki,</i>

07:59.199 --> 08:01.699
<i>that outgoing son of a bitch.</i>

08:01.701 --> 08:04.368
He beat you for most outgoing?

08:04.370 --> 08:06.504
Huh? Oh, no, we tied.

08:09.358 --> 08:11.876
Look, the point is, I can make
friends anywhere, even here.

08:11.878 --> 08:14.229
Thanks, baby.
You got it.

08:14.231 --> 08:16.181
(clicks tongue)

08:16.183 --> 08:17.982
Hey, excuse me.

08:17.984 --> 08:19.684
Listen.

08:19.686 --> 08:22.320
Do you think that you
would enjoy a show

08:22.322 --> 08:26.274
featuring Donatello, Raphael,

08:26.276 --> 08:28.743
Michelangelo and Leonardo?

08:28.745 --> 08:29.777
Sound like
you're a fan

08:29.779 --> 08:31.562
of the Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles.

08:31.564 --> 08:32.864
Gotcha. Skin it.

08:37.703 --> 08:40.455
He will get that
on the drive home.

08:40.457 --> 08:42.740
NARRATOR:
<i>He didn't.</i>

08:43.542 --> 08:45.376
Fireworks?
Yeah.

08:45.378 --> 08:47.595
Everything in there is a
prop we'll need for tonight.

08:54.136 --> 08:56.054
Everything.

08:56.056 --> 08:58.223
All right, here's how
this is going down.

08:58.225 --> 09:00.942
You'll be wearing this
earpiece and microphone.

09:00.944 --> 09:03.427
I'll be staked out here,
telling you exactly what to say,

09:03.429 --> 09:05.897
so just stay focused
and you'll be fine.

09:05.899 --> 09:08.233
Which play
are we gonna run first?

09:08.235 --> 09:10.401
How about
the "Weekend at Barney's"?

09:10.403 --> 09:11.953
(chuckles)

09:11.955 --> 09:13.571
Oh, Ted, your first day
at the salon,

09:13.573 --> 09:15.456
and you want
to do a cut and color?

09:15.458 --> 09:16.741
No.

09:16.743 --> 09:18.910
Tonight we're gonna
start off with...

09:20.312 --> 09:22.413
Ice Man to Neruda.

09:22.415 --> 09:24.332
Ice Man to Neruda.

09:24.334 --> 09:25.583
Bogey at 10:00,

09:25.585 --> 09:26.968
and she is packing
two fully-operational

09:26.970 --> 09:28.503
sweater stretchers.

09:28.505 --> 09:31.622
That's bravo, Oscar, Oscar,
bravo, Sierra.

09:31.624 --> 09:33.291
Possible delta cups.

09:33.293 --> 09:35.677
Copy that. Engaging target.

09:35.679 --> 09:37.262
Over.

09:37.264 --> 09:38.763
Excuse me,
I have a delivery for Lisa.

09:38.765 --> 09:41.232
Excuse me, I have
a delivery for Lisa.

09:41.234 --> 09:43.351
Are you Lisa?
Are you Lisa?

09:43.353 --> 09:44.635
Uh, no.

09:44.637 --> 09:45.937
But you must be.

09:45.939 --> 09:47.238
I was told to...

09:47.240 --> 09:50.475
...deliver this package
to a girl named Lisa,

09:50.477 --> 09:52.827
and that I'd recognize her
because she'd be...

09:52.829 --> 09:55.029
The most beautiful girl
in this bar.

09:55.031 --> 09:56.447
So, here's your delivery,

09:56.449 --> 09:57.582
Lisa.

09:57.584 --> 09:58.883
Uh, I am definitely
not Lisa,

09:58.885 --> 10:02.987
but I would be happy
to help you find her.

10:02.989 --> 10:05.790
Great, and then maybe later...

10:05.792 --> 10:09.160
I could give you
a different package-- my penis.

10:11.880 --> 10:13.514
That is a terrible line!

10:13.516 --> 10:14.766
You said it wrong.

10:14.768 --> 10:16.100
I did not say it wrong.

10:16.102 --> 10:17.335
My penis.

10:17.337 --> 10:18.870
No.
My penis.

10:18.872 --> 10:21.806
Still not right.
My penis, my penis, my penis!

10:23.726 --> 10:25.310
(muttering):
Hello.

10:27.313 --> 10:29.147
LILY:
<i>This sucks.</i>

10:29.149 --> 10:30.514
<i>I can't get near Strickland.</i>

10:30.516 --> 10:32.183
<i>At least Marshall's having</i>
<i>a good time.</i>

10:32.185 --> 10:35.953
<i>Man, he always knows</i>
<i>just the right thing to say.</i>

10:35.955 --> 10:38.856
For a gay guy,
Andy Warhol sure liked cans.

10:41.460 --> 10:42.827
<i>This sucks.</i>

10:42.829 --> 10:44.545
<i>Maybe I've lost my charm.</i>

10:44.547 --> 10:46.214
<i>No, Marshall,</i>

10:46.216 --> 10:48.383
<i>if Lily's gonna make it</i>
<i>in this fancy art world,</i>

10:48.385 --> 10:50.752
<i>you're gonna have to make it,</i>
<i>too, so suck it up,</i>

10:50.754 --> 10:52.553
<i>stop sitting on the art,</i>

10:52.555 --> 10:55.056
and bust out the "A" material.

10:58.761 --> 11:01.396
You two keep chugging
like that,

11:01.398 --> 11:02.546
you're gonna have to

11:02.548 --> 11:04.766
Vincent van <i>go</i>
to the bathroom, am I right?

11:04.768 --> 11:06.984
It's pronounced van <i>Gogh.</i>

11:08.604 --> 11:11.406
<i>Oh, "blogh" me.</i>

11:12.808 --> 11:15.143
I still don't get why someone
would leave the hospital

11:15.145 --> 11:17.078
without changing
into their clothes first. Over.

11:17.080 --> 11:18.413
Ted, this is my thing.

11:18.415 --> 11:20.331
So just... okay?

11:20.333 --> 11:21.332
Over.

11:21.334 --> 11:23.751
Okay? Over.

11:25.704 --> 11:26.871
Are you all right?

11:26.873 --> 11:28.356
What? Oh.

11:28.358 --> 11:30.992
Yes, yes, I'm fine.

11:30.994 --> 11:32.794
Tomorrow, I'm...

11:32.796 --> 11:35.563
donating a kidney
to my best friend.

11:35.565 --> 11:37.899
My best friend Barney.

11:37.901 --> 11:39.267
Not Marshall.

11:39.269 --> 11:40.902
Barney.

11:40.904 --> 11:42.403
Marshall's so lame.

11:43.839 --> 11:45.006
Anyway, uh...

11:45.008 --> 11:47.475
just wanted to grab
one last drink, in case...

11:47.477 --> 11:50.011
you know, I don't make it.

11:50.013 --> 11:51.462
You are so brave.

11:51.464 --> 11:52.997
Hey, listen. (clears throat)

11:52.999 --> 11:56.134
Before I give my best friend
this organ, how about...

11:57.403 --> 11:58.636
Nope.

11:58.638 --> 12:00.238
Nope, I'm not saying that.

12:01.073 --> 12:02.123
I did hear you,

12:02.125 --> 12:04.092
but I'm not saying that.

12:04.094 --> 12:05.293
Because I'm not.

12:05.295 --> 12:06.544
Are you okay?

12:06.546 --> 12:09.263
One second. I know you put
a lot of work into this.

12:09.265 --> 12:10.465
I understand that.

12:11.266 --> 12:12.467
I understand that.

12:13.268 --> 12:14.469
I understand that.

12:16.538 --> 12:17.738
I understand that.

12:17.740 --> 12:19.090
Why can't I just
talk to her?

12:19.092 --> 12:20.741
Maybe we'll hit it off...

12:21.777 --> 12:23.211
(sighs)

12:23.213 --> 12:24.679
Fine.

12:24.681 --> 12:26.380
Copy that.

12:28.250 --> 12:29.517
(clears throat)

12:29.519 --> 12:32.854
How about I give you
a different organ?

12:33.989 --> 12:35.656
My penis.

12:39.278 --> 12:41.162
You said it wrong.

12:41.164 --> 12:42.847
I did not say it wrong!

12:44.032 --> 12:46.117
Thank you all so much
for coming.

12:46.119 --> 12:47.468
If you'll
indulge me,

12:47.470 --> 12:49.003
I would like to share a story

12:49.005 --> 12:51.155
about my dearly departed
grandmother.

12:51.157 --> 12:52.340
MARSHALL:
<i>Oh, God.</i>

12:52.342 --> 12:54.342
<i>News flash, Johnny Ascot:</i>

12:54.344 --> 12:56.461
<i>Lots of people</i>
<i>have dead grandmas.</i>

12:56.463 --> 12:57.828
<i>No, Marshall.</i>

12:57.830 --> 12:59.663
<i>Don't be bitter.</i>

12:59.665 --> 13:01.165
<i>You're here for Lily.</i>

13:01.167 --> 13:03.217
<i>Just look at her,</i>
<i>so professional.</i>

13:03.219 --> 13:06.387
<i>She hasn't sat</i>
<i>on a single piece of art.</i>

13:06.389 --> 13:09.557
<i>You're gonna ride this thing</i>
<i>out with dignity for Lily.</i>

13:09.559 --> 13:12.343
<i>Not one more thing</i>
<i>that might embarrass her.</i>

13:12.345 --> 13:15.563
<i>I will simply stand here.</i>

13:15.565 --> 13:19.016
<i>Perfectly invisible.</i>

13:19.018 --> 13:20.451
And so I dedicate this show

13:20.453 --> 13:22.570
to my grandmother's memory.

13:22.572 --> 13:24.522
Now...

13:24.524 --> 13:27.191
please join me in honoring her

13:27.193 --> 13:31.662
with 60 seconds
of absolute silence.

13:36.134 --> 13:38.336
(clattering)

13:40.000 --> 13:46.074

13:58.073 --> 14:00.391
(one Skittle rattles on floor)

14:03.111 --> 14:06.214
BARNEY:
Okay, Neruda, this play is

14:06.216 --> 14:07.698
extremely complicated.

14:07.700 --> 14:09.116
Let me guess.
Does it involve me

14:09.118 --> 14:11.202
saying "my penis"
in a Scottish accent?

14:11.204 --> 14:13.170
(Scottish accent):
Now you're gettin' it, laddie!

14:14.540 --> 14:15.590
Hey!

14:15.592 --> 14:17.041
Robin. What are you doing here?

14:17.043 --> 14:18.342
I was curious as to whether

14:18.344 --> 14:20.044
you found Ted a date
to our wedding

14:20.046 --> 14:22.179
who was a little less,
you know, Antichrist-y.

14:25.634 --> 14:27.418
Is that the Playbook?

14:27.420 --> 14:32.590
No, Robin, that is a couch.

14:40.432 --> 14:42.733
Oh, you mean
the Playbook <i>on</i> the couch?

14:42.735 --> 14:43.734
I can explain.

14:43.736 --> 14:44.768
Don't bother.

14:44.770 --> 14:46.787
I can ex...
Uh, Ted? Uh...

14:46.789 --> 14:48.489
I got to step away from
mission control for a sec.

14:48.491 --> 14:50.441
Don't do anything stupid
while I'm gone.

14:50.443 --> 14:52.109
Robin...

14:52.111 --> 14:54.295
(no dialogue)

15:04.878 --> 15:06.662
Robin, wait.

15:07.589 --> 15:09.288
Um... shoot.
I haven't figured out

15:09.290 --> 15:11.424
what I'm gonna say yet.
Keep going.

15:13.294 --> 15:14.811
Robin, wait.

15:16.146 --> 15:18.598
Look, I'm sorry
that I still have the Playbook.

15:18.600 --> 15:21.100
It's just, it's filled
with a lifetime of great ideas.

15:21.102 --> 15:23.186
Am I supposed to just
leave all that behind?

15:23.188 --> 15:25.438
Yes.
But...

15:25.440 --> 15:27.690
"Weekend at Barney's"!

15:27.692 --> 15:28.858
Okay, what is that?

15:28.860 --> 15:31.160
Explain the
"Weekend at Barney's" to me.

15:31.162 --> 15:32.161
What's to explain?

15:32.163 --> 15:33.279
I play a dead guy,

15:33.281 --> 15:34.814
and Ted and Marshall
carry me around.

15:34.816 --> 15:36.866
Okay. And based on that,
girls want to sleep with you.

15:36.868 --> 15:38.334
Big time.
But you're dead.

15:38.336 --> 15:40.503
Yeah. Except not really,
obviously.

15:40.505 --> 15:41.921
But the girl thinks you're dead.

15:41.923 --> 15:42.923
No, she thinks I'm alive.

15:42.924 --> 15:44.040
Which you are.
Exactly.

15:44.042 --> 15:45.792
Except you're dead.
Exactly.

15:45.794 --> 15:47.493
Except you're alive.
Exactly.

15:47.495 --> 15:50.179
Okay, so instead of...
of being an alive person

15:50.181 --> 15:52.048
pretending to be a dead person

15:52.050 --> 15:53.600
pretending to be
an alive person,

15:53.602 --> 15:56.185
why not just be an alive person?

15:57.087 --> 15:59.606
Okay, let's start
from the beginning.

15:59.608 --> 16:03.726
The movie is called
<i>Weekend at Bernie's.</i>

16:03.728 --> 16:06.512
My name is Barney.

16:07.898 --> 16:09.699
I'm so sorry,
sweetie.

16:09.701 --> 16:11.067
I don't know
if you heard,

16:11.069 --> 16:12.402
but I dropped
some Skittles.

16:12.404 --> 16:13.486
Do you know what,
I'm just gonna

16:13.488 --> 16:14.787
go home before I
make things worse.

16:14.789 --> 16:16.456
You're not
going anywhere.

16:16.458 --> 16:17.624
We're a team.

16:17.626 --> 16:18.574
You stuck by me

16:18.576 --> 16:20.410
after my nip slip

16:20.412 --> 16:22.045
at your law school graduation.

16:22.047 --> 16:25.298
And after my nip slip
at the GNB Christmas party.

16:25.300 --> 16:26.716
And after my nip slip

16:26.718 --> 16:29.052
at the Honeywell and Coots
Family Fun Day.

16:29.054 --> 16:31.170
I don't know why you
keep wearing that top.

16:31.172 --> 16:32.805
All right,
I'll stay put,

16:32.807 --> 16:34.173
but I'm keeping
my mouth shut.

16:34.175 --> 16:37.260
No more jokes,
no more candy,

16:37.262 --> 16:39.312
no more Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles.

16:39.314 --> 16:41.047
Hey, are you guys
talking Ninja Turtles?

16:41.765 --> 16:43.516
I'm a huge TMNT fan.

16:43.518 --> 16:45.184
I grew up on those comic books.

16:45.186 --> 16:47.520
Me, too!
I was obsessed.

16:47.522 --> 16:49.605
Did you know that
the original comic debuted

16:49.607 --> 16:51.941
in 1984 at a convention
in New Hampshire?

16:51.943 --> 16:53.392
Uh, yes.

16:53.394 --> 16:55.561
Did you know that Eastman and
Laird always had their doubts

16:55.563 --> 16:56.996
about their characters
being commercialized?

16:56.998 --> 16:58.197
Yes!

16:58.199 --> 16:59.999
Did you know that the painting
on the back wall

17:00.001 --> 17:01.501
is inspired by Master Splinter?

17:02.453 --> 17:05.003
Oh, the one of the
rat doing karate.

17:05.006 --> 17:06.955
I see it now.

17:06.958 --> 17:08.124
Hey, I'm Strickland.

17:08.126 --> 17:09.575
Hey. Marshall.

17:09.577 --> 17:12.462
And this is my wife, Lily,
who, as a matter of fact,

17:12.464 --> 17:14.597
happens to represent one of
the biggest art collectors

17:14.598 --> 17:15.682
in New York City.

17:15.684 --> 17:16.965
I love your work.

17:16.968 --> 17:19.585
It's great to see you
getting some recognition.

17:19.587 --> 17:21.420
Thank you.
It's been a long haul.

17:21.422 --> 17:23.388
The first painting
I ever sold,

17:23.391 --> 17:26.476
I used the money
to get my car fixed.

17:26.478 --> 17:28.144
You might say...

17:28.146 --> 17:31.097
I used it to make my <i>van go.</i>

17:31.099 --> 17:32.398
(laughing):
That's...

17:32.400 --> 17:34.283
(laughing)

17:34.285 --> 17:37.370
Um, a little something
called rigor mortis?

17:37.372 --> 17:38.771
Oh, come on.

17:38.773 --> 17:40.773
Are you really this
mad about a book?

17:40.775 --> 17:43.943
You really think that this
is just about a book, Barney?

17:44.745 --> 17:45.661
You lied to me.

17:45.663 --> 17:47.113
If we're gonna
be in a marriage

17:47.115 --> 17:49.582
and trust each other,
you can't lie to me ever.

17:49.584 --> 17:50.666
Really?

17:50.668 --> 17:52.118
Well, that's just great.

17:52.120 --> 17:55.254
Because, in case you haven't
noticed these last eight years,

17:55.256 --> 17:57.390
lying is what I do best.

17:59.143 --> 18:00.459
I'm a magician, Robin.

18:00.461 --> 18:04.630
Misdirection and deceit
are my stock in trade.

18:04.632 --> 18:06.382
You don't want me
to lie to you?

18:06.384 --> 18:09.102
Lies are the reason
that we're together.

18:09.104 --> 18:10.970
Everything single
thing I did

18:10.972 --> 18:13.239
to get you to say yes
to me on that rooftop--

18:13.241 --> 18:15.575
Patrice, the false
engagement, everything--

18:15.577 --> 18:17.827
it was all utter malarkey.

18:17.829 --> 18:18.911
But...

18:18.913 --> 18:20.997
underneath all
of those lies

18:20.999 --> 18:23.199
is one true thing.

18:23.201 --> 18:26.202
One true thing
that can support the weight

18:26.204 --> 18:29.288
of all the lies
in the world, and...

18:29.290 --> 18:31.290
and that's the fact
that I love you.

18:31.292 --> 18:32.608
And you know

18:32.610 --> 18:34.177
that when I say that...

18:34.179 --> 18:35.678
I am not lying.

18:45.505 --> 18:46.689
Wha...

18:57.367 --> 18:58.868
Did you just unhook
my bra again?

18:58.870 --> 19:00.119
(Barney shushes)

19:00.121 --> 19:01.220
TED:
<i>Jeanette,</i>

19:01.222 --> 19:02.488
this is great.

19:02.490 --> 19:03.856
We're back together.

19:03.858 --> 19:06.542
You're coming to Barney
and Robin's wedding.

19:06.544 --> 19:09.495
I found two wine glasses
you didn't smash.

19:09.497 --> 19:11.547
Call me crazy,
but I've got a feeling,

19:11.549 --> 19:14.300
from here on out, it's gonna be
nothing but blue skies and...

19:14.302 --> 19:15.251
What...

19:15.253 --> 19:16.702
the hell...

19:16.704 --> 19:18.421
is this?!

19:19.306 --> 19:20.923
(cell phone chiming)

19:20.925 --> 19:22.058
Uh-oh.

19:22.060 --> 19:23.726
Check out this
text from Ted.

19:23.728 --> 19:25.595
(sighs)

19:29.166 --> 19:30.366
Oh, my...

19:30.368 --> 19:32.235
What the hell
happened here?

19:32.237 --> 19:34.403
Jeanette and I had
a little spat.

19:35.372 --> 19:36.489
(cuckoos)

19:36.491 --> 19:37.990
Would anyone like some wine?

19:37.992 --> 19:39.525
It's a nice Côtes du Rhne.

19:39.527 --> 19:41.027
Still needs to breathe a bit.

19:41.029 --> 19:43.496
You know what?
I got a decanter upstairs, so...

19:44.564 --> 19:47.233
We should just drink it now.

19:47.235 --> 19:48.501
JEANETTE:
And for

19:48.503 --> 19:49.702
the grand finale,

19:49.704 --> 19:51.237
I found your fireworks.

19:51.239 --> 19:53.372
Let's see what they do
to your precious Playbook!

19:53.374 --> 19:54.573
TED:
No!

19:54.575 --> 19:55.675
Jeanette, please,

19:55.677 --> 19:57.360
that's Barney's
life's work!

19:57.362 --> 19:58.744
BARNEY:
It's fine, Ted.

19:59.930 --> 20:01.264
Blow it up, Jeanette.

20:01.266 --> 20:05.685
♪ Put a candle in the window

20:09.139 --> 20:13.759
♪ 'Cause I feel
I've got to move ♪

20:17.231 --> 20:21.200

20:24.455 --> 20:28.291

20:38.135 --> 20:39.969
Okay.

20:39.971 --> 20:42.471
No more dating.

20:42.473 --> 20:44.340
I'm ready to settle down.

20:44.342 --> 20:45.758
NARRATOR:
<i>And, kids...</i>

20:45.760 --> 20:47.176
for the first time in my life,

20:47.178 --> 20:48.678
<i>I really meant it.</i>

20:48.680 --> 20:49.628
Oh!

20:49.630 --> 20:51.681
MARSHALL: Oh...
The boots...

20:51.683 --> 20:53.099
