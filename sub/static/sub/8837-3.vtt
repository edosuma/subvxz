WEBVTT

01:40.767 --> 01:43.060
OH, DARN IT!

01:43.228 --> 01:44.645
EASY, BUNNY.

01:44.813 --> 01:46.188
GOOD GIRL.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.065
COME ON.

02:06.292 --> 02:07.918
IT'S BEYOND
FIXING, LAURA.

02:08.086 --> 02:10.629
SHE'LL NEED A NEW SHOE
BEFORE YOU CAN RIDE HER.

02:10.797 --> 02:12.714
WELL, HOW MUCH
WILL THAT COST?

02:12.882 --> 02:15.592
50 CENTS.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.511
I HAVEN'T GOT IT.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.847
BUT I'LL GET IT
SOMEHOW, SOON.

02:20.014 --> 02:22.766
I JUST GOT TO, SO
BUNNY AND ME CAN GET
BACK INTO TRAINING.

02:22.934 --> 02:25.561
THE HERO TOWNSHIP
HORSE RACE IS ONLY
3 WEEKS AWAY.

02:25.728 --> 02:27.604
IF YOU PLAN ON RUNNING
BUNNY IN THAT RACE,

02:27.772 --> 02:30.107
SHE'LL HAVE TO BE
COMPLETELY RE-SHOD.

02:30.275 --> 02:32.693
TELL YOU WHAT I'LL
DO--I'LL MAKE YOU
A SPECIAL PRICE.

02:32.861 --> 02:35.696
$1.75 FOR THE WHOLE JOB.

02:35.864 --> 02:36.780
[SIGHS]

02:36.948 --> 02:39.950
I GOT TO GET YOU
THAT MONEY SOMEHOW.

02:40.118 --> 02:41.535
WE'LL BE BACK SOON.

02:41.703 --> 02:43.328
I THINK YOU GOT
A WINNER, LAURA,

02:43.496 --> 02:45.164
BUT DON'T RIDE HER
TILL I GET HER SHOD,

02:45.331 --> 02:47.082
BECAUSE SHE MIGHT
SPLIT A HOOF.

02:47.250 --> 02:50.919
I WON'T.
THANK YOU,
MR. DORFLER.

02:51.087 --> 02:53.172
COME ON,
BUNNY.
COME ON.

02:53.339 --> 02:54.965
COME ON,
GIRL.

03:07.937 --> 03:10.480
ALL RIGHT.

03:10.648 --> 03:12.858
I WANT YOU TO
TRY THIS ONE ON.

03:14.652 --> 03:17.696
THERE YOU GO.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.156
HOW DOES
THAT FEEL?

03:19.324 --> 03:21.700
IT'S...
FINE, PA.

03:21.868 --> 03:23.869
YOU SURE CAN MAKE
THINGS LIKE NEW.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.163
YEAH, BUT I CAN'T
MAKE THEM BIGGER.

03:26.331 --> 03:28.165
YOUR TOES WILL BE
BREAKING THROUGH
THERE IN NO TIME.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.959
OH, I'M AFRAID
LAURA'S AREN'T
MUCH BETTER.

03:31.127 --> 03:32.502
WE'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO HAVE
NEW SHOES

03:32.670 --> 03:34.463
FOR ALL 3,
AND SOON.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.215
Laura: PA.

03:36.382 --> 03:39.009
BUNNY THREW A SHOE, AND
MR. DORFLER SAYS SHE'S
GOING TO NEED 4 NEW ONES

03:39.177 --> 03:41.220
BEFORE I CAN RUN
HER IN THE RACE.

03:41.387 --> 03:43.013
HE SAID HE
COULD GIVE ME A
SPECIAL PRICE.

03:43.181 --> 03:45.349
NOT NOW,
LAURA.

03:45.516 --> 03:48.060
I'LL WORK IT
OFF, PA. I'LL
DO EXTRA CHORES.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.770
I JUST GOT TO
BE READY FOR
THAT RACE.

03:49.938 --> 03:52.356
HALF-PINT, WE CAN'T
SAVE A DOLLAR THAT
WE DON'T HAVE.

03:52.523 --> 03:54.816
IF I HAD ENOUGH MONEY
FOR SHOES, I'D BUY THEM
FOR YOU AND YOUR SISTERS,

03:54.984 --> 03:57.110
NOT FOR SOME HORSE WHO
CAN'T PULL HIS WEIGHT
AROUND THE FARM.

03:57.278 --> 03:58.403
YOU UNDERSTAND?

03:58.571 --> 03:59.655
YES, PA.

03:59.822 --> 04:01.365
I COULD STUFF
LAURA'S SHOES
WITH CLOTH,

04:01.532 --> 04:02.366
AND CARRIE
COULD WEAR
THEM. THAT WAY,

04:02.533 --> 04:03.992
WE'D ONLY
NEED TWO PAIR.

04:04.160 --> 04:07.788
JUST TWO PAIR?
I HAVEN'T GOT ENOUGH
MONEY TO BUY ONE PAIR.

04:07.956 --> 04:10.207
I GUESS WE'LL
JUST HAVE TO
CHARGE THEM.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.751
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL
ABOUT CHARGING MORE
THINGS AT THE STORE.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.711
WELL, CHARLES,
I DON'T SEE WHERE
WE HAVE A CHOICE.

04:14.879 --> 04:17.547
THE GIRLS
HAVE GOT TO
HAVE SHOES.

04:21.302 --> 04:24.137
ALL RIGHT.
I GUESS THERE'S NO
USE PUTTING IT OFF.

04:24.305 --> 04:26.014
DON'T JUST
STAND THERE IN
YOUR BIG FEET.

04:26.182 --> 04:28.308
HELP ME HITCH
UP THE WAGON.

04:49.372 --> 04:52.249
Mrs. Oleson: ISN'T
IT SOMETHING, THE
WAY THEY SPROUT UP?

04:52.417 --> 04:53.959
MY NELLIE
OUTGROWS HER SHOES

04:54.127 --> 04:56.545
BEFORE SHE CAN EVEN
WEAR THE SHOES OUT.

04:56.713 --> 05:00.507
OF COURSE, THEY
ARE BETTER QUALITY
THAN THE AVERAGE.

05:00.675 --> 05:02.092
I'M SURE THESE
WILL DO FINE.

05:02.260 --> 05:05.470
UH-HUH. ALL RIGHT,
THAT WILL BE...

05:05.638 --> 05:07.597
Mrs. Oleson: UH, $3.00
FOR THE TWO PAIR.

05:07.765 --> 05:10.183
UH...THOSE
ARE GOING TO
BE CHARGED.

05:10.351 --> 05:12.811
I ALREADY
DISCUSSED IT
WITH MR. INGALLS.

05:15.773 --> 05:19.026
OH, YOU KNOW,
I JUST THOUGHT
OF SOMETHING.

05:19.193 --> 05:20.902
WHY, NELLIE HAS
TWO PAIR OF SHOES

05:21.070 --> 05:22.404
THAT ARE
PRACTICALLY
LIKE PERFECT,

05:22.572 --> 05:24.031
AND SHE HAS GROWN
RIGHT OUT OF THEM.

05:24.198 --> 05:26.116
AND I WAS GOING TO
GIVE THEM TO THE
NEEDY IN MANKATO,

05:26.284 --> 05:30.620
Mrs. Oleson: BUT I THINK I
SHOULD GIVE THEM TO THE NEEDY
RIGHT HERE IN WALNUT GROVE!

05:30.788 --> 05:33.665
THAT'S VERY
KIND OF YOU, MRS.
OLESON, I'M SURE,

05:33.833 --> 05:36.668
BUT WE'LL
TAKE THESE WE
PICKED OUT.

05:38.629 --> 05:40.255
Mrs. Oleson: WELL, I
ALWAYS SAY, MRS. INGALLS,

05:40.423 --> 05:42.841
THAT CHARITY DOES
BEGIN AT HOME.

05:43.009 --> 05:45.427
WE DON'T
NEED CHARITY,
MRS. OLESON.

05:45.595 --> 05:46.803
Mrs. Oleson: WELL,
WHAT DO YOU CALL IT

05:46.971 --> 05:49.097
WHEN YOU COME IN HERE
AND CHARGE THINGS?

05:49.265 --> 05:51.683
I MEAN, EVERYTHING THAT
YOU SEE IN THIS STORE
WE HAVE PAID FOR.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.685
I'M WELL
AWARE OF THAT,
MRS. OLESON.

05:53.853 --> 05:57.606
Mrs. Oleson: WELL, THEN,
I DON'T SEE WHERE BEGGARS
CAN AFFORD TO BE CHOOSERS.

05:57.774 --> 06:00.150
THANK YOU FOR
YOUR KIND OFFER,
MR. OLESON.

06:00.318 --> 06:02.819
WE'LL BE BACK
WHEN WE CAN PAY
FOR THESE IN CASH.

06:02.987 --> 06:04.446
COME ALONG,
GIRLS.

06:04.614 --> 06:05.739
Charles:
WE'LL SEE YOU, NELS.

06:05.907 --> 06:07.491
Mr. Oleson:
BYE, CHARLES.

06:07.658 --> 06:10.994
EXCUSE ME,
MRS. OLESON.

06:11.162 --> 06:12.871
UNGRATEFUL SNIPPET!

06:14.040 --> 06:15.540
Caroline:
I JUST DIDN'T
WANT HER DAUGHTER

06:15.708 --> 06:17.042
POINTING AT OUR
GIRLS AT SCHOOL

06:17.210 --> 06:19.586
AND REMINDING THEM
THAT THEY WERE
WEARING HER CASTOFFS.

06:19.754 --> 06:21.505
Charles: I THINK YOU'RE
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

06:21.672 --> 06:23.465
BESIDES, WE
SHOULDN'T OWE THEM.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.133
HANSON'S GOT A LOT OF
ORDERS AT THE MILL.

06:25.301 --> 06:27.511
I'M SURE I CAN GET
HIM TO LET ME WORK
AN EXTRA SHIFT.

06:27.678 --> 06:28.970
Caroline: OH, NO,
THAT ISN'T RIGHT,

06:29.138 --> 06:32.516
YOU WORKING EXTRA
HARD JUST BECAUSE
OF MY PRIDE.

06:32.683 --> 06:35.477
MAYBE WE'D BETTER
JUST TURN AROUND
AND GO BACK.

06:35.645 --> 06:36.603
I'LL APOLOGIZE
TO MRS. OLESON.

06:36.771 --> 06:38.188
Charles: YOU HOLD ON.
YOU DO THAT,

06:38.356 --> 06:40.607
AND I'LL HIDE YOUR SHOES,
AND YOU'LL NEVER FIND THEM.

06:40.775 --> 06:42.275
[LAUGHS]

06:50.326 --> 06:51.451
MR. DORFLER!

06:51.619 --> 06:54.162
I'M IN THE
STABLE, LAURA!

06:59.001 --> 07:01.670
MR. DORFLER...

07:01.838 --> 07:03.046
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
SLOW DOWN, YOUNG'UN.

07:03.214 --> 07:04.881
YOU'LL SPOOK
THE HORSES.

07:05.049 --> 07:06.466
MR. DORFLER,
I JUST GOT TO GET

07:06.634 --> 07:08.385
THOSE NEW SHOES FOR
BUNNY FOR THAT RACE.

07:08.553 --> 07:09.886
Laura: RIGHT NOW, MY
PA'S GOT ALL HE COULD DO

07:10.054 --> 07:11.930
TRYING TO GET
NEW SHOES FOR US.

07:12.098 --> 07:14.558
HOW ABOUT IF I WORK
OFF THE PRICE FOR
THEM? I KNOW I COULD!

07:14.725 --> 07:16.017
OH, NOW,
HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

07:16.185 --> 07:18.562
JUST TAKE
IT EASY, NOW.

07:18.729 --> 07:20.605
YOU WANT TO WORK FOR ME
HERE AT THE STABLE?

07:20.773 --> 07:22.732
YES, SIR. I KNOW
I COULD DO IT.

07:22.900 --> 07:24.734
WELL, THERE'S PLENTY
TO BE DONE AROUND HERE,

07:24.902 --> 07:27.529
BUT I'M NOT QUITE
SURE YOU'RE THE
SIZE TO HANDLE IT.

07:27.697 --> 07:29.614
BUT I DO IT FOR
MY PA AT OUR BARN.

07:29.782 --> 07:31.741
HERE, JUST WATCH.

07:39.834 --> 07:42.169
EASY, NOW.
SLOW DOWN.

07:42.336 --> 07:44.129
WELL, YOU CERTAINLY
KNOW YOUR WAY
AROUND A BARN,

07:44.297 --> 07:45.464
THERE'S NO DOUBT
ABOUT IT.

07:45.631 --> 07:47.257
WE JUST MIGHT
BE ABLE TO WORK
SOMETHING OUT.

07:47.425 --> 07:49.593
THANKS, MR.
DORFLER, AND YOU
WON'T BE SORRY.

07:49.760 --> 07:50.844
I CAN GET STARTED
RIGHT NOW.

07:51.012 --> 07:52.387
NOW, HOLD ON.
FIRST THING
WE GOT TO DO

07:52.555 --> 07:55.265
IS CHECK AND SEE IF IT'S
ALL RIGHT WITH YOUR PA.

07:57.602 --> 07:59.019
PA!

07:59.187 --> 08:01.104
PLEASE TELL HIM
IT'S OKAY. PLEASE
TELL HIM I CAN DO IT.

08:01.272 --> 08:02.314
I JUST GOT TO
WIN THAT RACE!

08:02.482 --> 08:04.024
HEY, WELL, HOLD ON
A MINUTE, YOUNG LADY.

08:04.192 --> 08:06.234
TELL HIM WHAT'S ALL
RIGHT? WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

08:06.402 --> 08:08.195
MR. DORFLER SAYS
I CAN WORK FOR
HIM AT THE LIVERY.

08:08.362 --> 08:09.446
THAT WAY, WE CAN PAY
FOR BUNNY'S SHOES

08:09.614 --> 08:10.864
IN TIME FOR THE BIG
HERO TOWNSHIP RACE,

08:11.032 --> 08:13.450
AND I CAN WIN
THE BLUE RIBBON
AND EVERYTHING!

08:13.618 --> 08:15.452
I DON'T KNOW. THAT'S
AN AWFUL LOT FOR YOU
TO BE TAKING ON,

08:15.620 --> 08:17.954
WHAT WITH YOUR SCHOOLWORK,
YOU GOT YOUR CHORES
AT THE HOUSE...

08:18.122 --> 08:20.290
PLEASE, PA?
IT'D ONLY BE FOR
A COUPLE OF WEEKS,

08:20.458 --> 08:22.083
TILL I COULD PAY
FOR BUNNY'S SHOES.

08:22.251 --> 08:23.543
IT'S JUST LIKE WHAT
YOU'RE DOING FOR US.

08:23.711 --> 08:25.295
BESIDES, IT'S JUST
LIKE WHAT YOU SAID:

08:25.463 --> 08:30.091
"A MAN CAN DO ANYTHING
HE WANTS TO, ONCE HE
PUTS HIS MIND TO IT."

08:30.259 --> 08:31.259
Laura: PLEASE, PA?

08:31.427 --> 08:34.971
I COULD SURE USE
HER HELP, CHARLES.

08:35.139 --> 08:36.431
ALL RIGHT, YOU
CAN GIVE IT A TRY.

08:36.599 --> 08:38.600
THANKS, PA.
I'D BETTER GET
STARTED RIGHT AWAY.

08:38.768 --> 08:39.893
THAT WAY, I CAN
KEEP BUNNY THERE,

08:40.061 --> 08:41.645
AND IT WON'T COST
ANYTHING TO FEED HER.

08:41.812 --> 08:44.022
DON'T FORGET
ABOUT YOUR HOMEWORK!

08:48.653 --> 08:50.153
THAT'S AWFUL KIND
OF YOU, HANS.

08:50.321 --> 08:53.198
KINDNESS GOT NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT, CHARLES.
I NEEDED HER HELP.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.742
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT. SHE'S
JUST A LITTLE GIRL.

08:55.910 --> 09:00.080
SHE'S AN INGALLS,
ISN'T SHE? SHE'LL
GET THE JOB DONE.

09:00.248 --> 09:01.623
THANKS A LOT.

09:05.419 --> 09:08.421
Nellie and Willie:
LAURA SMELLS
LIKE A DIRTY HORSE

09:08.589 --> 09:14.386
LAURA SMELLS
LIKE A DIRTY HORSE

09:14.554 --> 09:16.471
YOU'D BETTER
WATCH OUT IN THOSE
NICE CLEAN CLOTHES.

09:16.639 --> 09:18.181
I GOT A LOT
OF WORK TO DO.

09:18.349 --> 09:21.518
WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT
ABOUT CLEANING UP AFTER
DIRTY OLD HORSES?

09:21.686 --> 09:23.353
ESPECIALLY THIS ONE.

09:23.521 --> 09:27.440
ME AND BUNNY,
WE GOT A RACE TO WIN
IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

09:27.608 --> 09:29.025
Nellie: YOU'RE
MAKING THAT UP.

09:29.193 --> 09:31.528
YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO RIDE HER
IN ANY OLD RACE.

09:31.696 --> 09:33.113
THAT'S WHAT
YOU THINK.

09:33.281 --> 09:37.033
I'M GLAD MY FATHER
GAVE HER BACK TO YOU.
SHE SMELLS BAD.

09:41.330 --> 09:43.039
DON'T WE ALL?

09:43.207 --> 09:45.292
MOTHER!

09:46.335 --> 09:48.503
[GIGGLING]

09:48.671 --> 09:50.505
WE DID IT, BUNNY.

09:50.673 --> 09:52.299
[GIGGLING]

09:56.554 --> 09:58.888
OH, HONEY,
DON'T DO THAT.

09:59.056 --> 10:00.432
EAT!

10:00.600 --> 10:02.267
I'M NOT
HUNGRY.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.269
STOP POUTING AND
EAT YOUR SUPPER.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.729
I CAN'T EAT.

10:05.896 --> 10:08.231
I'LL EAT HERS
IF SHE WON'T.

10:08.399 --> 10:10.734
YOU WILL NOT.

10:10.901 --> 10:12.652
NOW, EAT YOUR
SUPPER, DARLING,

10:12.820 --> 10:14.446
OR YOU'LL GET SICK.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.197
HOW CAN I
EAT KNOWING
LAURA INGALLS

10:16.365 --> 10:19.451
IS GOING TO RIDE MY
HORSE IN THE RACE?

10:19.619 --> 10:21.244
IT'S NOT YOUR
HORSE ANYMORE.

10:21.412 --> 10:25.290
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
GIVEN IT BACK TO HER.
YOU SHOULD'VE SHOT IT.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.750
NOW, LOOK HERE,
YOUNG LADY,

10:26.917 --> 10:28.793
I WOULDN'T BRING
THAT UP AGAIN,
IF I WERE YOU.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.295
Mr. Oleson:
YOU MISTREATED
THAT HORSE.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.339
AND FURTHERMORE,
YOU LIED TO US
ABOUT BEING HURT.

10:32.506 --> 10:33.673
YOU DON'T
DESERVE A HORSE,

10:33.841 --> 10:35.508
AND YOU MIGHT
AS WELL LIVE
WITH THAT FACT.

10:35.676 --> 10:37.218
WELL, I NEVER
THOUGHT I'D LIVE
TO SEE THE DAY

10:37.386 --> 10:40.597
WHEN YOU'D TAKE
SIDES AGAINST YOUR
OWN FLESH AND BLOOD.

10:40.765 --> 10:43.558
A FACT IS A
FACT. SHE'LL
GET OVER IT.

10:43.726 --> 10:47.604
UNTIL SHE DOES,
SHE DOESN'T
DESERVE A HORSE.

10:47.772 --> 10:48.855
[WEEPING LOUDLY]

10:49.023 --> 10:50.357
OH.

10:53.194 --> 10:55.445
CAN I EAT NELLIE'S
SUPPER NOW?

10:55.613 --> 10:56.655
[SIGHS]

10:56.822 --> 10:58.740
I SUPPOSE SO.

10:58.908 --> 11:00.784
[CRYING]

11:00.951 --> 11:02.869
OHH...

11:03.037 --> 11:06.915
NOW, NOW, BABY...

11:07.083 --> 11:10.543
WELL, YOU DIDN'T
WANT THAT MEAN
OLD HORSE, ANYWAY.

11:10.711 --> 11:12.128
SHE SHOULDN'T
HAVE IT, EITHER!

11:12.296 --> 11:14.547
SHE SAID TERRIBLE
THINGS TO ME!

11:14.715 --> 11:17.550
OH, I KNOW.
BUT LAURA INGALLS
IS JUST A...

11:17.718 --> 11:19.135
A BAD-MANNERED
LITTLE GIRL,

11:19.303 --> 11:23.139
AND YOU SHOULDN'T
PAY ANY ATTENTION
TO HER WHATSOEVER.

11:23.307 --> 11:26.434
OH, MY...

TO MANKATO FOR YOU

11:29.188 --> 11:31.648
FOR A BRAND-NEW

YOU LIKE THAT?

11:31.816 --> 11:33.233
I DON'T WANT IT!

11:33.401 --> 11:36.069
OH, I KNOW...

11:36.237 --> 11:37.946
I KNOW...

11:38.114 --> 11:41.574
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT
BEAUTIFUL DRESDEN DOLL
IN MOTHER'S TRUNK,

11:41.742 --> 11:44.953
THE ONE THAT MY MOTHER
GAVE TO ME WHEN I WAS
A LITTLE GIRL?

11:45.121 --> 11:46.913
WHAT IF I GO AND GET
IT FOR YOU RIGHT NOW?

11:47.081 --> 11:49.332
I DON'T WANT
AN OLD DOLL!

12:04.807 --> 12:06.683
OH...

12:06.851 --> 12:09.394
NOW, YOU JUST LISTEN
TO YOUR MOTHER.

12:09.562 --> 12:12.731
LAURA INGALLS IS NOT
GOING TO WIN THE RACE
WITH THAT HORSE.

12:12.898 --> 12:14.274
MOTHER WILL
TAKE CARE OF THAT.

12:14.442 --> 12:15.483
DO YOU PROMISE?

12:15.651 --> 12:17.068
I CERTAINLY DO.

WHAT ABOUT IT?

12:44.555 --> 12:45.805
WELL, IT JUST
OCCURRED TO ME

12:45.973 --> 12:48.767
THAT WE HAVEN'T
HAD A HOLIDAY

12:48.934 --> 12:51.186
WE'VE BEEN WORKING
SO HARD LATELY.

12:51.353 --> 12:53.396
SEEMS TO ME THAT
A DAY AWAY FROM HERE

12:53.564 --> 12:56.107

A WORLD OF GOOD.

12:56.275 --> 12:58.067

THE STORE?

12:58.235 --> 13:00.236

AFTER ALL, THE
TOWNSPEOPLE CAN DO
WITHOUT US FOR A DAY.

13:03.908 --> 13:08.495

APPRECIATE WHAT WE DO
FOR THEM ALL THE MORE,

13:08.662 --> 13:10.246
AND I COULD, UH...

13:10.414 --> 13:14.709

YES. SHE FIGURES WE SHOULD
DONATE SOMETHING TO MAKE
THE RACE MORE IMPORTANT,

BECAUSE IT ALWAYS
BRINGS MORE BUSINESS
INTO THE STORE.

19:25.330 --> 19:26.873
I JUST
THOUGHT YOU'D
LIKE TO SEE IT.

19:27.040 --> 19:30.501

LOT OF HORSE FOR JUST
A YOUNG MISS LIKE YOU.

20:00.782 --> 20:01.824
BUT YOUR MOTHER PAID
GOOD MONEY FOR IT.

20:01.992 --> 20:03.201
I GUESS SHE KNOWS
WHAT SHE'S DOING.

20:03.368 --> 20:04.493

20:19.009 --> 20:21.719

20:21.887 --> 20:24.555
BE SURE TO BRUSH HIM
DOWN WELL AND GIVE
HIM PLENTY OF WATER.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.878
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

20:56.046 --> 20:58.214
IT JUST ISN'T FAIR.

20:58.382 --> 21:00.091
WHAT ISN'T FAIR?

21:00.259 --> 21:02.468

21:08.809 --> 21:10.476
WITHOUT EVER HAVING
TO DO A LICK OF WORK,

21:10.644 --> 21:12.436
WHILE OTHER LITTLE
GIRLS GOT TO WORK
NIGHT AND DAY

21:12.604 --> 21:15.231
JUST TO HOLD ON
TO WHAT THEY HAVE?

21:15.399 --> 21:18.567
THAT'S IT.
IT JUST ISN'T FAIR.

21:18.735 --> 21:19.860
THERE'S A LOT OF
THINGS IN THIS LIFE

21:20.028 --> 21:22.697
THAT AREN'T GOING

HE GAVE YOU A LOT OF SPUNK.

21:33.166 --> 21:34.542
WELL,
THE FACT IS...

21:34.710 --> 21:37.920
I DON'T THINK
THAT SPUNK'S GOING
TO HELP ME NOW,

21:38.088 --> 21:42.174
NOW THAT NELLIE'S
GOT THAT NEW
THOROUGHBRED.

21:42.342 --> 21:44.927

HORSES CAN READ?

21:49.474 --> 21:50.766
I DON'T THINK BUNNY
READ THOSE PAPERS,

21:50.934 --> 21:52.560
AND I THINK BUNNY
THINKS SHE CAN WIN
THAT RACE,

21:52.728 --> 21:54.270
AND SO DO I.

21:54.438 --> 21:56.647
AND YOU WILL
IF YOU TRY HARD.

21:56.815 --> 21:58.691
IT'S NOT GOING
TO DO YOU ANY
GOOD TO QUIT.

22:00.235 --> 22:02.653
BESIDES, I NEVER DID
HEAR OF AN INGALLS
THAT WAS A QUITTER.

22:04.781 --> 22:07.116
I'M NOT GOING
TO QUIT, PA.

22:07.284 --> 22:09.452
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S MORE
LIKE IT.

22:09.619 --> 22:11.120
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME
FINISH UP THIS WORK?

22:11.288 --> 22:12.788
YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH
FOR TODAY. YOU GET
SOME SLEEP.

22:12.956 --> 22:14.707
WELL, I'VE ONLY
GOT A LITTLE
BIT LEFT TO DO.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.792
I COULD GET IT DONE
IN TWO SHAKES OF
A LAMB'S TAIL.

22:16.960 --> 22:21.255
THAT'S RIGHT. YOU
COULD COUNT SHEEP IN
CHURCH TOMORROW, TOO.

22:21.423 --> 22:22.840
GO ON.
GET SOME SLEEP.

22:23.008 --> 22:24.884
- I LOVE YOU.
- I LOVE YOU, TOO.

22:25.052 --> 22:26.135
DON'T YOU WORRY
ABOUT THAT RACE.

22:26.303 --> 22:28.512
YOU'RE GOING
TO DO FINE.

22:28.680 --> 22:31.140
- GOOD NIGHT, PA.
- GOOD NIGHT, I LOVE YOU.

22:58.543 --> 23:00.127
MR. DORFLER,
I HAVEN'T--

23:00.295 --> 23:02.171
I KNOW, I KNOW.

23:02.339 --> 23:05.758
YOU DIDN'T WANT ME
TO SHOE HER TILL YOU
COULD PAY FOR IT.

23:05.926 --> 23:08.344
BUT IF YOU EXPECT
TO BEAT NELLIE'S
HORSE IN THAT RACE,

23:08.512 --> 23:10.346
YOU'VE GOT
TO WORK HER OUT.

23:10.514 --> 23:12.014
A CHAMPION HAS
GOT TO BE WORKED,

23:12.182 --> 23:14.600
AND THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE
WITHOUT SHOES.

23:14.768 --> 23:16.519
NOW, I TRUST YOU
TO FINISH THE JOB.

23:16.686 --> 23:19.271
AND YOU TRUST
ME TO KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

23:19.439 --> 23:21.023
COME ON. I
WANT TO SHOW
YOU SOMETHING.

23:21.191 --> 23:22.191
BUT,
MR. DORFLER--

23:22.359 --> 23:24.860
DON'T TALK,
JUST WALK.

23:25.028 --> 23:27.154
Mr. Dorfler:
YEAH, HERE WE ARE.

23:28.865 --> 23:30.199
HERE IT IS.

23:30.367 --> 23:33.452
SEE? THIS IS
THE ONE YOU'LL USE.

23:33.620 --> 23:36.205
BUT I ALREADY HAVE
A SADDLE THAT
MY PA MADE ME.

23:36.373 --> 23:37.915
OH, I KNOW, AND
IT'S A GOOD ONE,

23:38.083 --> 23:39.291
FOR A RIDE
IN THE MEADOW.

23:39.459 --> 23:42.044
BUT TO WIN A
RACE, YOU NEED A
LIGHTWEIGHT SADDLE.

23:42.212 --> 23:44.505
YOU KNOW,
A COUPLE OF POUNDS
OVER A TWO-MILE COURSE

23:44.673 --> 23:49.051
CAN MAKE ALL THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
WINNING AND LOSING.

23:49.219 --> 23:51.554
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO THANK YOU,
MR. DORFLER.

23:51.721 --> 23:54.390
YOU THANK
ME BY WINNING
THE RACE, LAURA.

23:54.558 --> 23:56.475
COME OVER HERE
A MINUTE.

23:56.643 --> 24:00.396
YOU SEE THIS HORSE?
A BEAUTY, A REAL
THOROUGHBRED.

24:00.564 --> 24:04.692
BUT ALL HE'S DONE FOR
THE LAST 3 DAYS IS EAT
AND GET FAT AND LAZY.

24:04.860 --> 24:07.862
NOW, LIKE I
SAID, A HORSE
HAS TO BE WORKED.

24:08.029 --> 24:10.156
SO I'M GOING TO
FINISH SHOEING
YOUR HORSE.

24:10.323 --> 24:13.826
YOU WORK HER EVERY
DAY, AND THAT'S
HOW YOU'LL WIN.

24:13.994 --> 24:16.245
I'LL WIN,
MR. DORFLER.

24:16.413 --> 24:18.164
I KNOW YOU WILL.

25:19.726 --> 25:22.186
OH, IT'S GETTING LATE.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.146
WE'D BETTER GET TO BED.

[ROOSTER CROWS]

25:56.555 --> 25:58.264
HERE,
CARRIE.

25:58.431 --> 26:00.849
LAURA, I TALKED
TO MISS BEADLE
YESTERDAY.

26:01.017 --> 26:03.185
SHE'S VERY
CONCERNED ABOUT
YOUR HOMEWORK.

26:03.353 --> 26:04.353
I'LL CATCH UP, MA.

26:04.521 --> 26:05.688
I KNOW YOU'RE
WORKING VERY HARD,

26:05.855 --> 26:07.690
BUT YOUR SCHOOLING
COMES FIRST.

26:07.857 --> 26:09.024
MAY I SEE
YOUR HOMEWORK?

26:09.192 --> 26:11.694
SURE. I JUST GOT
A LITTLE ARITHMETIC
TO FINISH.

26:11.861 --> 26:14.947
I FIGURE I'LL
GET IT DONE
DURING LUNCH.

26:21.663 --> 26:22.997
MARY?

26:25.041 --> 26:26.542
YES, MA?

26:26.710 --> 26:28.877
IS THIS
YOUR WORK?

26:29.045 --> 26:31.589
ONLY THE LAST
3 PROBLEMS, MA.

26:31.756 --> 26:33.090
[SIGHS]

26:35.385 --> 26:36.969
I'M GOING TO
PUNISH YOU FOR
THIS, HALF-PINT.

26:37.137 --> 26:39.221
I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE
YOUR SISTER DOING YOUR
HOMEWORK FOR YOU.

26:39.389 --> 26:41.640
Mary: SHE DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW I DID IT, PA.

26:41.808 --> 26:44.351
IT WASN'T HER
IDEA. HONEST.

26:44.519 --> 26:45.728
MARY, I'M SURE
YOU MEANT WELL,

26:45.895 --> 26:47.313
BUT THAT ISN'T
GOING TO HELP
YOUR SISTER

26:47.480 --> 26:49.231
LEARN HER
ARITHMETIC.

26:49.399 --> 26:51.275
YOUR MA AND I ARE
PROUD OF WHAT YOU'RE
TRYING TO DO,

26:51.443 --> 26:52.818
BUT YOUR HOMEWORK
COMES FIRST.

26:52.986 --> 26:54.612
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
- YES, SIR.

26:54.779 --> 26:55.946
NOW, IT'S NOT GOING
TO HAPPEN AGAIN?

26:56.114 --> 26:57.948
- NO, SIR.
- MARY?

26:58.116 --> 26:59.617
NO, PA.

26:59.784 --> 27:01.243
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
OFF TO SCHOOL.

27:01.411 --> 27:03.579
AND MAKE SURE YOU
CHANGE THOSE PROBLEMS
AND DO THEM YOURSELF.

27:03.747 --> 27:05.080
I WILL.

27:05.248 --> 27:06.582
BYE.

27:09.252 --> 27:11.128
- BYE, MA.
- BYE-BYE.

27:12.839 --> 27:14.214
THANKS.

27:14.382 --> 27:15.883
IT'S OKAY.

27:16.051 --> 27:17.801
SORRY I GOT
YOU IN DUTCH.

27:17.969 --> 27:19.053
I'LL MAKE UP
FOR IT.

27:19.220 --> 27:21.805
JUST BEAT NELLIE

27:35.779 --> 27:37.613
THANK YOU, NELS.
- THANK YOU.

27:37.781 --> 27:40.115
I SAW NELLIE
WORKING THAT NEW
HORSE OF YOURS.

27:40.283 --> 27:41.617
SHE LOOKED
REAL GOOD.

27:41.785 --> 27:43.619
YEAH...TOO GOOD.
THAT'S THE TROUBLE.

27:43.787 --> 27:44.536
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

27:44.704 --> 27:46.246
WELL, WE HAVE
7 ENTRIES.

27:46.414 --> 27:49.458
5 OF THEM SAW THE WORKOUT
AND DECIDED THEY
DIDN'T WANT TO RACE.

27:49.626 --> 27:51.669
WELL, THAT
LEAVES NELLIE
AND LAURA INGALLS.

27:51.836 --> 27:54.421
WELL, IT'LL STILL
BE A GOOD RACE.

27:54.589 --> 27:56.256
LAURA'S HORSE AGAINST
A THOROUGHBRED?

27:56.424 --> 27:58.425
WHY, SHE DOESN'T
HAVE A CHANCE!

27:58.593 --> 28:01.553
IT'S TOO BAD, TOO.
I WAS HOPING FOR
A REAL CONTEST.

28:01.721 --> 28:04.640
THIS DOLLAR SAYS
LAURA WILL WIN.

28:04.808 --> 28:06.141
WELL, I'M HAPPY
TO TAKE YOUR MONEY,

28:06.309 --> 28:07.476
BUT WOULD YOU
MIND TELLING ME

28:07.644 --> 28:09.687
WHAT MAKES YOU
THINK THAT LAURA
HAS A CHANCE?

28:09.854 --> 28:11.188
SHE'S BEEN RIDING
EVERY DAY.

28:11.356 --> 28:13.315
LAURA'S HORSE
IS IN BETTER SHAPE
THAN NELLIE'S.

28:13.483 --> 28:15.484
AND LAURA'S
10 POUNDS LIGHTER
THAN NELLIE.

28:15.652 --> 28:19.405
NOW, IN A TWO-MILE
RACE, THAT'LL MAKE
ALL THE DIFFERENCE.

28:43.471 --> 28:46.014
YOU KNOW, I'VE
BEEN DOING A GREAT
DEAL OF THINKING

28:46.182 --> 28:48.559
ABOUT THAT RACE
THIS COMING SATURDAY.

28:48.727 --> 28:51.478
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT'S
ALL YOU HAVE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT.

28:51.646 --> 28:54.022
AND I PROMISED
YOU, NELLIE,

28:54.190 --> 28:56.608
THAT I WOULD NOT
LET LAURA INGALLS
WIN THAT RACE,

28:56.776 --> 28:58.485
AND I INTEND
TO KEEP MY
PROMISE.

28:58.653 --> 29:00.904
ME AND SPARKS
WILL WIN, MA.

29:01.072 --> 29:04.450
NOT THE WAY
YOU'VE BEEN STUFFING
YOURSELF, YOU WON'T.

29:04.617 --> 29:06.160
AND BESIDES WHICH,
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
WORKING OUT

29:06.327 --> 29:08.537
THAT HORSE, EITHER.
- BUT, MA--

29:08.705 --> 29:11.665
NO...I HAVE DECIDED
THAT WILLIE

29:11.833 --> 29:14.376
IS GOING TO RIDE
SPARKS IN THE RACE.

29:14.544 --> 29:18.130
HE'S AT LEAST 15
POUNDS LIGHTER
THAN LAURA,

29:18.298 --> 29:19.715
AND THAT SHOULD
DO THE TRICK.

29:19.883 --> 29:21.425
BUT SHE'S MY HORSE!

29:21.593 --> 29:24.219
AND I PAID FOR IT!

29:24.387 --> 29:27.055
Mrs. Oleson: NOW,
I ALSO AM GIVING MY
MOTHER'S SILVER BOWL

29:27.223 --> 29:28.390
AS THE TROPHY
FOR THE WINNER,

AND I HAVE
NO INTENTIONS OF
LETTING THAT BOWL

29:30.727 --> 29:31.935
OUT OF THIS FAMILY.

29:32.103 --> 29:33.395
NOW, WILLIE...

29:33.563 --> 29:36.398
I WANT YOU TO START
WORKING OUT SPARKS
IN THE MORNING.

29:36.566 --> 29:38.233
YES, MA.

29:38.401 --> 29:41.069
OH! NO SWEETS!

29:41.237 --> 29:42.905
BUT I'M HUNGRY!

29:43.072 --> 29:44.740
NO SWEETS.

29:44.908 --> 29:46.700
NOT UNTIL
AFTER THE RACE.

29:46.868 --> 29:48.535
NOW, I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I'LL DO...

29:48.703 --> 29:50.662
I WILL MAKE UP
A SPECIAL BATCH

29:50.830 --> 29:53.165
OF CANDIED APPLES
JUST FOR YOU.

29:53.333 --> 29:55.250
- YES, MA.
- YES.

29:55.418 --> 29:56.919
EXCUSE ME.

29:57.086 --> 29:59.713
I SEEM TO HAVE
LOST MY APPETITE.

30:09.933 --> 30:13.727
MMM. CAROLINE,
THIS IS DELICIOUS.

30:13.895 --> 30:15.813
THANK YOU.

30:15.980 --> 30:17.856

YOUR WORKOUTS COMING?

30:18.024 --> 30:19.775
BUNNY IS IN
TOP FORM, PA.

30:19.943 --> 30:22.653
MR. DORFLER IS
A GREAT TRAINER.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.822
SO IS MARY.

30:24.989 --> 30:27.449
LAURA, YOU'VE
HARDLY EATEN
A THING.

30:27.617 --> 30:28.575
DO YOU FEEL ALL RIGHT?

30:28.743 --> 30:29.910
YES, MA'AM.

30:30.078 --> 30:33.455
I JUST HAVE TO
KEEP MY WEIGHT
DOWN FOR THE RACE.

30:33.623 --> 30:34.957
LAURA, YOU KNOW I WANT
YOU TO WIN THE RACE

30:35.124 --> 30:36.416
AS MUCH AS ANYBODY DOES.

30:36.584 --> 30:38.460
BUT YOUR HEALTH IS MORE
IMPORTANT THAN A RACE.

30:38.628 --> 30:40.546
SO, AT LEAST, EAT
YOUR VEGETABLES.

30:40.713 --> 30:43.298
YES, MA'AM,
BUT NO DESSERTS.

30:43.466 --> 30:46.593
NOT FOR A COUPLE
OF DAYS, ANYWAY.

30:46.761 --> 30:48.512
I'LL BE GLAD WHEN
SATURDAY COMES AND GOES,

30:48.680 --> 30:50.889
AND WE CAN GET BACK
TO NORMAL AROUND HERE.

30:51.057 --> 30:53.183
NOT ME. I
KIND OF LIKE IT
THE WAY IT IS.

30:53.351 --> 30:55.894
MORE CHICKEN AND
DUMPLINGS FOR ME.

30:56.062 --> 30:57.104
THERE YOU ARE.

30:57.272 --> 30:59.439

TIME FINISHING

31:11.452 --> 31:12.494

31:12.662 --> 31:14.454

- NO, YOU WON'T.

31:14.622 --> 31:15.998

FATTENING, TOO.

31:16.165 --> 31:19.626
I DON'T WANT YOU
GAINING ANY WEIGHT
BEFORE THE RACE.

GOT TO DO
WITH THE RACE?

31:22.297 --> 31:23.380

YOU KNOW?

I'VE DECIDED
TO LET WILLIE

YES, SIR.

32:10.720 --> 32:12.220

TO GIVE BUNNY A
LIGHT WORKOUT...

32:18.770 --> 32:19.853
TO LOOSEN HER UP.

32:20.021 --> 32:21.438
THAT'S WHAT
MR. DORFLER
SAYS TO DO.

32:21.606 --> 32:23.899
YOU LISTEN TO HIM.
HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S
TALKING ABOUT.

32:24.067 --> 32:25.817
UP YOU GO.

32:30.448 --> 32:32.658
THERE YOU GO.

32:32.825 --> 32:34.326
JUST REMEMBER,
WHATEVER THE OUTCOME
OF THE RACE,

32:34.494 --> 32:36.745

JUST DO YOUR BEST.

32:36.913 --> 32:38.163

YES, SIR.

32:40.541 --> 32:41.667

SOMETHING ELSE.

I'D LIKE BETTER,

TO SLEEPY EYE TO
SPEND IT WITH HER,

TERRIBLE STOMACH PAINS.
AFRAID IT MIGHT BE SERIOUS.

34:21.517 --> 34:23.643
I JUST SAW HIM
A WHILE BACK. HE'S ON
HIS WAY TO SLEEPY EYE.

34:23.811 --> 34:25.270
DON'T WORRY.
I'LL CATCH HIM.

34:58.721 --> 35:03.100
DOC BAKER!

35:08.397 --> 35:10.023
DR. BAKER, THE
OLESONS NEED
YOU REAL BAD.

35:10.191 --> 35:11.775

35:11.943 --> 35:13.485
I'M ON MY WAY.

Dr. Baker: UNDER
YOUR TONGUE, WILLIE.

35:34.841 --> 35:38.760
Harriet: AND THEN
HE JUST WOKE UP
SCREAMING IN PAIN!

35:38.928 --> 35:40.011
OUCH!

35:40.179 --> 35:41.304

35:41.472 --> 35:43.265
OUCH!

35:43.432 --> 35:45.976
Dr. Baker: HERE?
Willie: OUCH! YES!

35:46.144 --> 35:47.602
WHAT DO YOU
THINK, DOC?

36:06.080 --> 36:07.581
I THINK 6 OF THESE
CANDIED APPLES

36:07.748 --> 36:10.959
ARE BOUND TO GIVE
ANYONE A WHOPPER
OF A STOMACHACHE.

36:11.127 --> 36:12.794
OH! I TOLD YOU

36:12.962 --> 36:16.506
NOT UNTIL AFTER
THE RACE, YOUNG MAN!

36:16.674 --> 36:19.301
OH, YOU JUST WAIT
UNTIL YOU'RE WELL
ENOUGH TO STAND UP,

36:19.468 --> 36:22.304
AND YOU WILL GET
THE WHIPPING OF
YOUR LIFE!

36:22.471 --> 36:23.805
BUT I WAS
HUNGRY, MA!

36:23.973 --> 36:25.640
GIVE HIM A DOSE
OF CASTOR OIL,

36:25.808 --> 36:27.142
AND LET NATURE
TAKE ITS COURSE.

36:27.310 --> 36:29.019
Willie: NO CASTOR OIL!
PLEASE!

36:29.187 --> 36:31.438
YES, CASTOR OIL!

36:31.606 --> 36:33.148
THE NEXT ORDER
OF BUSINESS IS
TO GO DOWN THERE

36:33.316 --> 36:35.233
AND THANK LAURA
FOR WHAT SHE DID.

36:35.401 --> 36:36.651
THEN I'M GOING OVER
AND TELL DORFLER

36:36.819 --> 36:40.030
THAT WILLIE IS
IN NO CONDITION
TO RACE TODAY.

36:48.497 --> 36:50.624

THE TYPICAL
FOOLISHNESS...

36:50.791 --> 36:51.833
A YOUNGSTER
THAT AGE.

36:52.001 --> 36:53.460
HAD TOO MUCH.
MUCH TOO MUCH.

36:53.628 --> 36:55.503
BUT ARE YOU
SURE, NOW?

36:55.671 --> 36:58.423
WE'VE GOT THE
WHOLE HOUR TILL
RACE TIME. PERHAPS--

36:58.591 --> 37:00.008
HEY, HERE
COMES LAURA.

37:03.387 --> 37:05.597
- HER HORSE LOOKS TIRED.
- HE SURE IS.

37:05.765 --> 37:07.140
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

37:10.019 --> 37:12.812
MR. OLESON, IS
WILLIE ALL RIGHT?

37:12.980 --> 37:15.315
IT TURNED OUT TO
BE JUST A LITTLE
TUMMYACHE.

37:15.483 --> 37:17.817
Mr. Oleson: BUT WE
WANT TO THANK YOU FOR
WHAT YOU DID, LAURA.

37:19.362 --> 37:21.571
WELL, HE'S NOT GOING
TO BE ABLE TO RACE
TODAY, LAURA,

37:21.739 --> 37:24.699
SO I GUESS WE'LL
JUST HAVE TO FORFEIT
THE RACE TO YOU.

37:26.827 --> 37:30.038
MR. HANSON,
SINCE BUNNY'S ALL
TUCKERED ANYWAY,

37:30.206 --> 37:32.791
WHY DON'T WE JUST
POSTPONE THE RACE
TILL NEXT WEEK?

37:32.959 --> 37:35.126
Mr. Hanson:
JA, SURE.

37:35.294 --> 37:38.046
SINCE BOTH PARTIES
ARE WILLING, I THINK
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

37:38.214 --> 37:40.423
BUT YOU CAN'T
DO THAT!

37:42.301 --> 37:43.635
I MEAN, AFTER ALL,

INTO TOWN JUST
TO SEE THE RACE.

Mrs. Oleson: IT
WOULDN'T BE FAIR TO THEM.

37:49.141 --> 37:51.226
YOU JUST SAID
YOURSELF THAT WILLIE
CAN'T RIDE TODAY.

37:51.394 --> 37:54.437
OH, WELL, THAT
HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE RACE!

37:54.605 --> 37:56.690
AFTER ALL, IT'S...
IT'S NELLIE'S HORSE,

37:56.857 --> 37:59.192
AND NELLIE WILL
RIDE HER HORSE.

37:59.360 --> 38:02.821
AND THAT'S THE WAY
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

38:02.989 --> 38:05.407
I JUST CAN'T
RUN BUNNY IN
THAT RACE.

38:05.574 --> 38:07.033
SHE'S TOO
TIRED OUT.

38:07.201 --> 38:10.245
Mr. Oleson: WELL,
NOW, WE CAN'T HAVE A
RACE WITH ONE HORSE.

WON'T THERE,
MR. HANSON?

38:21.382 --> 38:22.674
JA, I GUESS SO.

38:22.842 --> 38:25.385
WELL...WELL,
WE'LL GO INSIDE
AND GET OUR THINGS,

38:25.553 --> 38:28.513
AND WE'LL MEET YOU ALL
AT THE STARTING LINE,
ALL RIGHT, DARLING?

38:28.681 --> 38:30.348
Nellie: YES.

39:14.602 --> 39:16.728
DORFLER JUST TOLD ME.

39:19.148 --> 39:20.982
I CAN'T DO
IT, PA.

39:21.150 --> 39:22.400
I JUST CAN'T RUN
BUNNY IN A RACE

39:22.568 --> 39:24.986

YOU TO, HALF-PINT.

IT ISN'T FAIR.

39:31.077 --> 39:34.704
ME AND BUNNY...
WE WORKED SO HARD.

39:34.872 --> 39:37.374
IT JUST ISN'T FAIR.

39:37.541 --> 39:41.503
WELL, NOBODY
WORKED HARDER,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

39:41.670 --> 39:44.005
SHE RAN SO GOOD
THIS MORNING.

39:44.173 --> 39:48.051
SHE'D HAVE WON.
I KNOW SHE'D
HAVE WON.

WELL, YOU WAIT
AND SEE. THERE'S
GOING TO BE

39:49.720 --> 39:52.764
A LOT OF OTHER
RACES. YOU'LL
GET YOUR CHANCE.

39:52.932 --> 39:55.558
I WANT TO TAKE
BUNNY HOME, PA.

Mr. Dorfler: SHE'S
A NATURAL-BORN
COMPETITOR.

40:25.589 --> 40:26.673
THAT'S A FACT,

40:26.841 --> 40:28.758
SHE DOESN'T EVEN
LOOK TIRED NOW.

BUT SHE
COULDN'T DO IT,
COULD SHE, PA?

40:31.011 --> 40:33.054
NOT AFTER

NELLIE'S EXTRA WEIGHT
IN YOUR FAVOR.

40:39.228 --> 40:40.603

TO ME, HALF-PINT.

YOU MAY THINK
BUNNY'S TIRED, AND
I MAY THINK SO, TOO,

BUT I DON'T THINK
EITHER ONE OF US ARE
GOING TO CONVINCE
