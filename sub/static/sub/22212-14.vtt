00:08.258 --> 00:09.968
<i>Previously on </i>Riverdale:

00:16.182 --> 00:18.518
Don't come any closer.
Don't touch anything.

00:18.601 --> 00:20.812
-Yes, it was.

00:20.895 --> 00:22.439
You lied to us.

00:22.522 --> 00:26.735
That shady guy was a drug dealer.
And what else is he lying about?

00:26.818 --> 00:30.822
What do Sunnyside Trailer Park,
Twilight Drive-In and Southside High

00:30.905 --> 00:31.990
all have in common?

00:32.073 --> 00:35.785
You control them.
Now the trailer park is in jeopardy?

00:35.869 --> 00:38.830
Can't you just feel the invisible hand
of Hiram Lodge all over this?

00:38.913 --> 00:41.624
We got people scared
they're gonna lose their home.

00:41.708 --> 00:44.586
As a gesture of goodwill,
I'd like to settle any back rent

00:44.669 --> 00:46.963
-you or your neighbors owe the town.
-It's a deal.

00:48.590 --> 00:50.341
One thing. Mayor McCoy tells me

00:50.425 --> 00:52.635
there's some exposÃ©
you're working on, Jughead.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.763
I'd appreciate
if you kept my name out of it.

00:54.846 --> 00:57.223
-That sounds a lot like a bribe. No deal.
-Heh.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.643
See you in the funny pages.

01:02.187 --> 01:04.689
<i>Picture a girl living</i>
<i>in the house next door.</i>

01:04.773 --> 01:06.900
<i>Give her a ponytail and a secret.</i>

01:06.983 --> 01:10.904
<i>Day after day, she checks the headlines</i>
<i>and watches the local news,</i>

01:10.987 --> 01:12.614
<i>waiting to be exposed.</i>

01:18.286 --> 01:20.538
Chic, what's wrong with your bathroom?

01:20.622 --> 01:23.374
-You have better water pressure.
-Tough. Use your own.

01:23.458 --> 01:26.878
<i>And bit by bit,</i>
<i>the walls close in</i>

01:26.961 --> 01:32.133
<i>until what was once just a house</i>
<i>becomes her own private purgatory.</i>

01:33.426 --> 01:34.761
Still at it, Mother?

01:35.303 --> 01:39.265
I thought you'd be tired of taking filthy
wads of cash from strangers by now.

01:40.892 --> 01:44.395
You have no right to judge me.

01:45.146 --> 01:48.983
Not when you drove away
the one chance I had at a better life.

01:49.067 --> 01:52.529
You mean with Hal Cooper?
If that's your idea of love.

01:53.404 --> 01:57.033
What would you know about it?
You've never known love, Cheryl,

01:57.117 --> 01:58.743
except to rip it apart.

01:58.827 --> 02:02.413
Because you are a jealous, spite-filled,

02:02.497 --> 02:05.750
starving, emotional anorexic.

02:07.710 --> 02:09.712
Have a nice day at school, dear.

02:14.217 --> 02:17.387
Ah, I'm glad I caught you both.
Mrs. Lodge and I

02:17.470 --> 02:20.431
were headed up to the lake house,
but we're gonna have to cancel

02:20.515 --> 02:23.893
due to some business.
So, why don't you kids go instead?

02:23.977 --> 02:25.937
Make a little romantic getaway.

02:26.646 --> 02:28.773
-Thank you, Mr. Lodge.
-That'd be amazing.

02:28.857 --> 02:31.818
Andre can drive you up, stay nearby
in case you wanna go into town.

02:31.901 --> 02:35.613
No chaperones. Andre can drop us off.
Pick us up on Sunday.

02:35.697 --> 02:38.616
-We don't need your spy shadowing us.
-Fine, <i>mija.</i>

02:39.284 --> 02:40.785
Invite Betty and Jughead.

02:40.869 --> 02:43.163
-Make a real weekend out of it.
-That'd be great.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.039
Before you head off,

02:45.123 --> 02:47.000
-Yeah. Hey, just an FYI.

02:52.171 --> 02:54.132
While you're at the lake, Mrs. Lodge and I

02:54.215 --> 02:56.134
will be hosting a meeting
at The Pembrooke

02:56.217 --> 02:59.721
-with the major New York families.

03:00.305 --> 03:04.434
Yeah, there's been some unrest
since Poppa Poutine's death,

03:04.517 --> 03:07.020
and I'd prefer
Veronica safely out of town.

03:07.103 --> 03:10.899
That cabin at Shadow Lake is
a sort of safe house for us.

03:10.982 --> 03:13.610
I'll make sure Veronica's protected,
Mr. Lodge.

03:13.693 --> 03:14.777
I'm sure you will.

03:15.236 --> 03:20.450
But despite my daughter's wishes,
Andre will be there, unseen but nearby.

03:21.826 --> 03:24.037
I hope I can trust you to keep that
between us.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.331
You know, man-to-man.

03:28.416 --> 03:30.335
I was checking out a few places.

03:31.085 --> 03:33.713
There's that one building
on Franklin and Sycamore.

03:33.796 --> 03:35.757
Dad, there's living on the wrong side
of the tracks,

03:35.840 --> 03:37.842
and there's living
directly over the tracks.

03:37.926 --> 03:42.013
I'm a soda jerk at Pop's, Jughead.
We won't be moving into The Pembrooke.

03:42.096 --> 03:44.933
We shouldn't have to move at all.
No one should have to move.

03:45.016 --> 03:47.435
This is just Hiram Lodge's vendetta
against us.

03:47.894 --> 03:51.397
Look, he is planning something, Dad.
Something big and bad.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.567
I just have to figure out
a different angle.

04:00.907 --> 04:01.866
Hey, Moose.

04:01.950 --> 04:05.453
There's this new movie, <i>Love, Simon,</i>
playing at the Bijou.

04:05.536 --> 04:09.374
It's a John Hughes-ian coming-of-age,
coming-out movie.

04:09.457 --> 04:11.834
Yeah, I know,
I'm already going with Midge.

04:12.961 --> 04:17.257
-You can come with us. She wouldn't mind.
Midge is that open

04:17.340 --> 04:20.176
Yeah, she knows all about us.
I told her. She's cool with it.

04:21.302 --> 04:26.349
Cool, right, yeah. I think I'm gonna pass.
It's all a little too <i>Big Love</i> for me.

04:29.394 --> 04:32.689
Fair warning,
our Shadow Lake chalet is rustic,

04:32.772 --> 04:36.276
but it has breathtaking views
of the mountains, the water.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.736
Oh, my God. That sounds heavenly, V.

04:39.904 --> 04:42.699
What do you say, Jug

04:45.451 --> 04:48.454
-As long as it's cool with your dad.
-Mr. Lodge suggested it.

04:48.538 --> 04:51.291
-Yeah.
-Well, then cue the dueling banjos.

04:53.501 --> 04:56.587
What? It'll be a good chance
for me to work on my novel.

04:56.671 --> 05:00.174
Excellent. Remember,
the point of this luxury weekend

05:00.258 --> 05:02.010
is to relax and unplug.

05:02.093 --> 05:05.096
Luxury and weekend.
Two of my favorite words.

05:05.179 --> 05:09.142
So, where are we going and how extravagant
a wardrobe should I pack?

05:09.225 --> 05:14.397
Sorry, Cheryl. It's kind of
a romantic couples-only weekend.

05:16.482 --> 05:19.861
I see. Of course. My mistake.

05:19.944 --> 05:22.572
Well, have fun with your romances.

05:30.621 --> 05:31.456
What's up?

05:31.873 --> 05:35.918
Don't get me wrong, I'm thrilled
you're up for this weekend away,

05:36.878 --> 05:39.297
but why am I also slightly suspicious?

05:40.673 --> 05:44.886
Possibly because I need a new source
of intel for my article on Hiram Lodge,

05:44.969 --> 05:47.263
and I was thinking that
that could be Veronica.

05:48.681 --> 05:51.142
She's on the inside
of her family business.

05:51.225 --> 05:54.145
One, can you please not investigate
my best friend

05:54.228 --> 05:57.106
when she's nice enough to invite us
to her family's cabin?

05:57.190 --> 06:00.151
And two,
ever since that night, it's like...

06:01.986 --> 06:04.781
Chic is everywhere.

06:05.364 --> 06:09.327
I need this weekend to be an escape.

06:09.410 --> 06:10.244
All right.

06:11.621 --> 06:14.082
I solemnly promise I'll behave myself.

06:14.749 --> 06:15.708
Hm.

06:21.422 --> 06:23.091
Be down in a second, Jug.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.935
-You must be Chic.
-You're Betty's boyfriend.

06:34.852 --> 06:36.020
Guilty.

06:36.521 --> 06:38.397
Um... Yes.

06:38.481 --> 06:42.401
-You know what happened here.

06:44.654 --> 06:47.698
-Don't worry. You can trust me.
-If you tell anyone...

06:48.032 --> 06:49.992
it'll be bad for Betty and Alice.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.998
Ready. Let's go. See you, Chic.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.867
When I was younger,
we used to come here every summer,

07:30.950 --> 07:32.618
whenever my dad could sneak away
for a weekend.

07:38.458 --> 07:43.129
Veronica wasn't kidding.
It really was the last house on the left.

07:43.212 --> 07:46.090
-I'll help you with the bags.
-No, we've got it.

07:46.174 --> 07:47.008
Archie?

07:51.179 --> 07:52.430
TTFN, Andre.

07:52.513 --> 07:55.349
See you Sunday night at 7 p.m.
and not a second earlier.

07:56.559 --> 07:58.895
Betty, wait till you see the inside.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.774
I'm sure Mr. Lodge explained,

08:03.858 --> 08:06.319
if there's any trouble,
I'm a phone call away.

08:27.465 --> 08:29.008
-Oh, my God.

08:30.718 --> 08:34.472
Welcome to what I humbly like
to call Lodge Lodge.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.023
<i>How's the lake house?</i>

08:44.106 --> 08:47.527
<i></i>

08:47.610 --> 08:49.987
It's Cheryl, you welfare baby.

08:50.071 --> 08:51.280
Is something wrong?

08:51.364 --> 08:54.617
Not yet. I just wanna make sure you know

08:54.700 --> 08:57.578
that Archie and Betty kissed
in front of my house,

08:57.662 --> 09:01.791
and that it seemed pretty serious,
with-tongues serious. That's all.

09:01.874 --> 09:04.252
Enjoy your couples-only weekend.
Kisses to all. Bye.

09:08.297 --> 09:11.384
Jug Are you okay?

09:11.467 --> 09:12.635
That was Cheryl.

09:13.678 --> 09:16.180
She said you and Archie kissed
in front of her house.

09:26.190 --> 09:29.694
That's all. Enjoy your couples-only
weekend. Kisses to all. Bye.

09:34.949 --> 09:36.242
Did you just tell Jughead

09:40.204 --> 09:44.667
-Oh, that's right. You're new here.

09:44.750 --> 09:48.546
Hi. I'm Cheryl Blossom,
a.k.a. Cheryl Bombshell,

09:48.629 --> 09:50.923
which means I need no reasons.

09:51.007 --> 09:54.594
I simply am. Feel free to tremble.

09:55.177 --> 09:56.387
I have a better idea.

09:56.887 --> 10:01.142
Why don't you tell me what's bothering you
because clearly you're in a lot of pain.

10:02.059 --> 10:06.105
Get your sapphic Serpent hands
off my body!

10:13.154 --> 10:17.033
You think they're gonna break up?
That'd be like the 12th time this year.

10:17.116 --> 10:20.077
We didn't break up over it.

10:27.960 --> 10:28.794
Archie.

10:30.004 --> 10:31.255
That kiss.

10:35.593 --> 10:38.012
That's for telling me about it
when you did.

10:38.929 --> 10:40.097
For trusting me.

10:41.932 --> 10:43.809
Shows how strong we are together.

10:44.769 --> 10:47.688
-Ronnie.
-Us against the world.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.122
Do you want the top or bottom drawer?

11:06.666 --> 11:09.168
Jug, can we please talk
about this already?

11:13.089 --> 11:14.924
Betty, I'm not mad about the kiss.

11:16.050 --> 11:19.887
But I am wondering why you didn't tell me
when I told you about Toni.

11:20.805 --> 11:22.431
I wanted to tell you.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.683
Is it because you think Archie's
my third

11:26.018 --> 11:26.852
Uh...

11:28.354 --> 11:29.230
Okay.

11:30.439 --> 11:31.273
Yes.

11:33.275 --> 11:35.486
I mean, you guys grew up
next to each other.

11:36.153 --> 11:40.074
Your windows literally face one another.
That used to bother me.

11:42.159 --> 11:45.204
But after everything
that we've been through recently, heh,

11:45.746 --> 11:48.999
I'm not intimidated
by a Black Hood-prompted kiss.

11:49.875 --> 11:50.918
Okay.

11:57.091 --> 11:58.300
Oh, my God.

11:59.552 --> 12:00.845
Are they serious?

12:00.928 --> 12:05.057
Is that their response to everything?
Can't they ever just have a conversation?

12:11.355 --> 12:12.273
Hi, guys.

12:12.982 --> 12:14.567
-Hi.
-Hey.

12:14.650 --> 12:16.819
Relax.
Heh.

12:17.528 --> 12:18.654
Everything's fine.

12:20.739 --> 12:25.035
Awesome, because you guys haven't tried
my jalapeÃ±o margaritas.

12:25.619 --> 12:26.662
Who wants one?

12:27.830 --> 12:29.748
<i>I'd like to propose a toast.</i>

12:29.832 --> 12:33.794
To the Lodges, to their hospitality,
and to putting the past behind us.

12:33.878 --> 12:34.879
Cheers.

12:34.962 --> 12:35.880
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

12:39.758 --> 12:41.594
So, do your parents come up here

12:41.677 --> 12:44.430
-Not as much as they'd like.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.474
Daddy's such a workaholic.

12:46.557 --> 12:47.892
On the SoDale project?

12:48.851 --> 12:51.645
Is it getting intense?
It is.

12:51.729 --> 12:56.066
Luckily, Archie's dad is doing a superb
job of keeping everything on schedule.

12:56.150 --> 12:58.611
V, tell us more about
your fancy neighbors.

12:58.694 --> 13:00.988
Yeah, are they in the same business
as your dad?

13:01.071 --> 13:03.449
-Jughead. I mean it.

13:04.783 --> 13:08.871
Betty, I'm just making idle conversation.
I'm sorry. Please continue.

13:08.954 --> 13:13.125
It's a hodgepodge, really. Some are
in entertainment, some are in business,

13:13.209 --> 13:14.585
some are in real estate.

13:14.668 --> 13:17.796
You know what's weird?
I noticed that none of the houses

13:17.880 --> 13:20.424
have mailboxes or numbers on them.
Why is that?

13:20.508 --> 13:23.844
-Shadow Lake is a private community.

13:23.928 --> 13:26.722
Jughead.
Seriously, this isn't 20 Questions.

13:28.807 --> 13:30.184
Toxic twin alert.

13:30.267 --> 13:33.270
I knew things weren't kosher
in the state of Bughead.

13:36.106 --> 13:40.736
Guys. I'm picking up some residual tension
from, I'm guessing,

13:40.819 --> 13:43.405
-Cheryl's random act of cruelty earlier.

13:43.489 --> 13:44.698
-No. We're fine.
-Uh, no.

13:44.782 --> 13:46.158
Which is understandable.

13:46.242 --> 13:48.827
Fear you not, though.
I have just the antidote.

13:48.911 --> 13:53.457
Step one, clothes off, swimsuits on.

13:56.252 --> 14:01.757
âª<i> Try me in your evening </i>âª

14:04.552 --> 14:09.848
<i>âª I don't plan on leaving âª</i>

14:09.932 --> 14:14.019
Ah. I don't know about you guys,
but I'm feeling better already.

14:14.979 --> 14:18.649
Okay, so, full disclosure time.

14:21.151 --> 14:25.489
When Archie told me about the kiss,
I absorbed it, processed it,

14:25.573 --> 14:28.701
and in the end,
I bear no ill will toward my beau,

14:28.784 --> 14:29.910
nor my bestie.

14:29.994 --> 14:33.956
But has the thought of it haunted me
these last few weeks?

14:34.039 --> 14:35.499
A tiny bit, yeah.

14:37.001 --> 14:40.588
And now, Betty and Jughead,
you are caught up in the aftermath.

14:40.671 --> 14:43.382
So, to clear the air amongst us,

14:44.383 --> 14:45.634
Jughead and I...

14:46.051 --> 14:47.094
should kiss.

14:49.013 --> 14:49.847
What?

14:52.725 --> 14:55.561
Wait a minute, I don't know. Hold on.

14:56.812 --> 14:58.564
Veronica and I, kissing?

14:58.647 --> 14:59.982
Might help to, uh...

15:00.065 --> 15:02.693
What's the
What's the sports term, Archie?

15:03.110 --> 15:06.614
A little help?

15:06.697 --> 15:10.034
-You're not upset though, Jug.
-No, really, I'm not upset.

15:10.117 --> 15:11.994
-Right.
-But I'm human.

15:12.578 --> 15:16.957
What if a future me tries to use your kiss
with Archie against some future you?

15:17.541 --> 15:19.919
A Vughead kiss? Right now, in the present,

15:20.002 --> 15:24.131
might be precisely what is takes to save
a future Bughead from imploding.

15:26.050 --> 15:28.594
Archie, come on, man.
It's just a stupid kiss.

15:29.511 --> 15:30.346
Right?

15:33.724 --> 15:34.600
Jughead.

15:35.684 --> 15:36.602
Don't freak out.

15:39.021 --> 15:39.855
Just trust me.

16:01.961 --> 16:06.757
You know what I realized? Out of the four
of us, only you and Archie haven't kissed.

16:06.840 --> 16:07.925
Fascinating.

16:09.677 --> 16:10.511
Wait.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.721
What

16:19.436 --> 16:22.564
Did it make you feel better?
Kissing Veronica?

16:25.067 --> 16:27.903
It felt good watching Archie's face.

16:28.195 --> 16:31.657
Okay, but did you enjoy kissing her?

16:31.740 --> 16:33.993
I know entrapment when I hear it, Betty.

16:36.662 --> 16:40.791
Because if you did,
I might have to punish you.

16:42.042 --> 16:43.168
How?

16:45.587 --> 16:47.131
I packed this...

16:48.340 --> 16:52.970
in case you needed a distraction
from your sleuthing.

16:54.138 --> 16:56.390
Consider me...

16:57.558 --> 16:58.517
distracted.

16:58.600 --> 17:01.770
<i>âª Making love to someone else âª</i>

17:04.690 --> 17:07.151
Don't get me wrong,
I love a good floor show,

17:07.234 --> 17:11.196
but if this is a response
to Jughead threatening your masculinity...

17:11.280 --> 17:13.157
I'm just getting my daily workout in.

17:16.368 --> 17:17.202
Well...

17:19.621 --> 17:22.249
there are other ways to do that.

17:24.251 --> 17:26.253
I'm actually kind of tired, Ronnie.

17:27.796 --> 17:29.048
You're kidding, right?

17:32.426 --> 17:33.469
Oh, my God.

17:35.971 --> 17:36.805
Are they...?

18:18.555 --> 18:22.392
I'd prefer if you don't go
into town. Mr. Lodge's daughter isn't...

18:22.726 --> 18:23.644
blending in.

18:26.980 --> 18:30.275
-Veronica.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.653
-Your father asked me to stay on--

18:32.736 --> 18:34.696
Your dad's doing business
back in Riverdale,

18:34.780 --> 18:36.990
he's hosting a meeting
of the other families

18:37.074 --> 18:39.868
and he wanted to make sure we--
You would be safe.

18:39.952 --> 18:40.994
Wait, you knew?

18:41.954 --> 18:43.789
Here's what's going to happen.

18:43.872 --> 18:48.335
You're gonna tell my dad your cover's
blown because you're a horrible spy,

18:48.418 --> 18:50.254
and then you're leaving, immediately.

18:52.005 --> 18:52.840
Go.

18:59.388 --> 19:01.890
-Veronica, I don't think it's a good idea

19:01.974 --> 19:03.684
-to send Andre away.
-No, Archie.

19:05.060 --> 19:07.146
You need to give me some space, okay?

19:07.229 --> 19:10.899
I'm getting Betty and we're going
into town, alone, just us girls.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.734
You can stay here and entertain Jughead.

19:13.402 --> 19:16.572
Oh. Try not to choke on your testosterone
while you're at it.

19:22.661 --> 19:23.495
Mom.

19:24.288 --> 19:25.539
-Hey, Josie.
-Josie.

19:25.622 --> 19:27.833
Tom and I were just discussing

19:27.916 --> 19:30.669
the new security system
we're installing at the law firm.

19:30.752 --> 19:34.256
Yeah, well, you two do enjoy
working together, so...

19:35.549 --> 19:37.926
-Well, I should get back to the station.
-Okay.

19:42.097 --> 19:43.015
Josie.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.811
We talked about this.
Tom and I care about each other.

19:48.353 --> 19:49.855
I know, it's just...

19:50.898 --> 19:55.152
It's weird to see him here, with you,
like that,

19:55.235 --> 19:56.778
especially when Dad doesn't know.

19:57.863 --> 19:58.780
Josie.

20:00.490 --> 20:01.366
He does know.

20:02.451 --> 20:06.121
I told him. We were going to wait
till after you graduated,

20:06.205 --> 20:07.164
-but--

20:08.749 --> 20:10.209
Are you getting a divorce?

20:11.793 --> 20:13.378
Because of Sheriff Keller?

20:14.004 --> 20:15.797
Is he getting a divorce, too?

20:15.881 --> 20:19.593
He hasn't talked to his wife yet.
She's still overseas. Or Kevin.

20:19.676 --> 20:22.179
But, Josie, we have to respect that.

20:23.722 --> 20:24.723
Respect?

20:33.065 --> 20:34.900
Did you know
Betty and Veronica kissed?

20:36.610 --> 20:38.487
What

20:39.071 --> 20:43.325
Apparently, first week of school,
during cheerleading tryouts,

20:43.408 --> 20:44.451
B and V kissed.

20:45.619 --> 20:46.703
-Yeah.

20:47.162 --> 20:48.288
Why?

20:48.372 --> 20:49.706
I couldn't tell you.

20:50.582 --> 20:53.710
Betty tried explaining it,
but the rationale still eludes me.

20:57.756 --> 21:00.300
Jug. About me kissing Betty...

21:01.260 --> 21:02.970
There's really no good excuse.

21:04.388 --> 21:05.305
I'm sorry.

21:06.932 --> 21:07.766
It's okay.

21:08.392 --> 21:10.894
Admittedly,
this is all way more complicated

21:10.978 --> 21:13.605
-than any of us could have planned.

21:13.689 --> 21:16.566
You and me, for example.
I'm your best guy-friend.

21:16.650 --> 21:19.820
Betty is your best girl-friend.
Your best friends are dating.

21:20.445 --> 21:22.656
But B and V are also best friends,

21:22.739 --> 21:26.952
so, your best friend's girlfriend is
also your girlfriend's best friend.

21:27.035 --> 21:30.622
-Uh, no. Not really.

21:30.706 --> 21:34.751
It should be amazing we're all so close.
But sometimes it terrifies me.

21:37.045 --> 21:39.089
It's like the four of us are
in a powder keg.

21:39.965 --> 21:42.634
All it would take is one match,
and we'd all blow up.

21:49.266 --> 21:50.726
Great toss, Archie.

21:53.186 --> 21:57.024
I'm glad you called, Josie.
I was thinking about this year's musical,

21:57.107 --> 22:00.819
which I'm directing, and I want it
to be a star vehicle for you.

22:01.194 --> 22:05.115
You might not want that
after I tell you why I called.

22:06.116 --> 22:09.161
What are you doing here?

22:10.203 --> 22:12.873
-So, it's true.

22:12.956 --> 22:17.044
Mom's risking her life every single day,
and you're running around with your boss.

22:17.711 --> 22:18.587
Former boss.

22:19.171 --> 22:22.674
God. I spent my whole life
trying to live up to your standards.

22:22.758 --> 22:24.509
-Kevin--
-And it's all crap.

22:29.639 --> 22:33.435
So, Betty, unless that was some
seriously aggressive hand-holding

22:33.518 --> 22:36.063
-I heard through the wall last night...

22:36.146 --> 22:37.272
When did that start?

22:38.815 --> 22:40.942
The night of your confirmation.

22:41.777 --> 22:43.028
-Mm-hm.

22:43.570 --> 22:48.408
Well, as my <i>abuelita</i> likes to say,
"Praise Jesus."

22:48.784 --> 22:53.080
Hi. I'd like this, and this.

22:53.747 --> 22:57.751
And-- Oh, the last time I was here,
you had the most scrumptious scones.

22:57.834 --> 23:00.629
Yeah, my grandma makes them,
but just during the summer.

23:00.712 --> 23:04.007
-For the summer people.
-Oh. That's when we normally come up.

23:04.091 --> 23:06.259
Ah. Thought I recognized you.

23:06.343 --> 23:08.345
You got one of those places
on Shadow Lake.

23:08.845 --> 23:12.265
-But you're usually with your folks.
-Yeah, they're back in, um...

23:12.933 --> 23:14.309
I was about to say New York,

23:14.392 --> 23:16.520
-but we're in Riverdale now.

23:16.603 --> 23:19.147
Bet they don't even know
what to do with you there.

23:19.231 --> 23:20.607
No, they do not.

23:21.149 --> 23:24.027
-Enough flirting here.

23:24.111 --> 23:27.030
You had a fight with Archie,
you didn't break up with him.

23:27.864 --> 23:28.949
I'm Cassidy.

23:37.165 --> 23:39.835
So, how's it been

23:40.460 --> 23:43.964
-Oh. Things have been nice.

23:44.297 --> 23:46.341
Nice is not what I heard last night.

23:46.424 --> 23:50.804
Okay, you know what I wore that night
we got Chuck into that hot tub?

23:51.388 --> 23:52.472
Betty, what

23:55.809 --> 23:57.310
Hi.

23:58.145 --> 23:59.437
Hey.

24:05.694 --> 24:07.112
Are you still mad at me?

24:07.696 --> 24:08.572
Yes.

24:10.157 --> 24:13.160
But you can make it up to me
by remembering one thing.

24:13.243 --> 24:15.495
And it's simple and non-negotiable.

24:16.913 --> 24:22.002
From now on, it's me and you,
not you and my dad, okay?

24:27.674 --> 24:31.344
If that's Cheryl, tell her everyone
kissed everyone and it's over.

24:31.428 --> 24:32.262
It's my dad.

24:33.471 --> 24:34.806
Hey. Dad, what's up?

24:34.890 --> 24:37.309
<i>Jughead, hey.</i>
<i>You're not gonna believe it.</i>

24:37.392 --> 24:39.895
Hold on. I can't hear you. Hold on a sec.

24:39.978 --> 24:41.855
Everyone's over here celebrating.

24:41.938 --> 24:44.524
Listen. The eviction notices,
the back rent,

24:44.608 --> 24:47.485
it's all gone, paid in full.
No one has to move out.

24:47.569 --> 24:51.198
-You. You shamed him into it.

24:51.281 --> 24:52.741
<i>He did a complete 180.</i>

24:53.366 --> 24:56.953
What are you talking about?
-Hiram. Hiram Lodge.

24:57.037 --> 25:01.124
Well, he just bought Sunnyside
Trailer Park and he said we can all stay.

25:01.208 --> 25:03.293
-We're staying!

25:04.628 --> 25:05.462
<i>Jug.</i> <i>Jug.</i>

25:20.060 --> 25:24.689
First your dad buys the drive-in,
now he owns Sunnyside Trailer Park.

25:24.773 --> 25:28.318
As I suspected, he is gobbling up
the Southside, piece by piece.

25:28.401 --> 25:31.321
Slow down. Mr. Lodge is evicting people
from the trailer park?

25:31.863 --> 25:34.991
No, he cleared us of our debts
and revoked our evictions.

25:35.075 --> 25:37.577
-Yes.

25:37.827 --> 25:40.747
-Because it's a tactic.

25:40.830 --> 25:44.626
It's a smokescreen. PR 101.
He's trying to buy my silence again.

25:44.709 --> 25:47.587
Good lord, Jughead.
How much of a narcissist are you?

25:47.671 --> 25:50.924
You wrote an article attacking Mr. Lodge,

25:51.007 --> 25:53.635
demanding he makes amends.
That's what he's trying to do.

25:55.345 --> 25:57.055
They do kind of have a point.

25:57.639 --> 26:00.433
Look, Jug, I know you love conspiracies,

26:01.184 --> 26:03.561
but take the win, bro,
and let's celebrate.

26:04.562 --> 26:08.984
I credit you with a lot of things, Josie,
but being cruel is not one of them.

26:10.235 --> 26:14.197
-Tom told me what you said to Kevin.
-He deserved to know the truth.

26:14.281 --> 26:16.866
So, maybe he could save
his parents' marriage.

26:16.950 --> 26:20.370
Kevin's not talking to his father.
Tom's trying to reach his wife.

26:20.453 --> 26:22.706
-It's a mess.
-Like what you did to us.

26:22.789 --> 26:26.042
Imploding our lives?
Without even telling me?

26:26.126 --> 26:29.587
I did not implode our lives.
The Lodges did.

26:29.671 --> 26:33.925
It's not how I wanted things to come out,
that choice was taken away from me.

26:34.009 --> 26:37.387
Just like you took it away
from Tom and Kevin.

26:39.180 --> 26:40.890
I wasn't trying to hurt them.

26:41.474 --> 26:43.727
And I wasn't trying to hurt you, either.

26:59.409 --> 27:01.494
Kevin. Hey.

27:02.245 --> 27:04.873
-Hey, Moose, Midge.

27:05.498 --> 27:06.333
Nope.

27:06.958 --> 27:08.168
Uh, I'm alone.

27:10.211 --> 27:12.714
In that case, grab your plate
and come sit with us.

27:14.132 --> 27:16.676
-Yeah, definitely.

27:17.802 --> 27:19.012
The more the merrier.

27:20.513 --> 27:21.639
Why the hell not?

27:23.600 --> 27:28.188
So, Kevin, who are you meeting
at the movie

27:28.730 --> 27:33.485
Oh, no, I don't have a date.
I'm just going to this gay rom-com alone.

27:34.319 --> 27:35.153
What?

27:36.446 --> 27:39.324
No. No, that's crazy.
We need to find you someone.

27:40.200 --> 27:44.204
What about one of those new
Southside guys? I hear one of them's gay.

27:44.287 --> 27:47.374
If it's Fangs Fogarty, I don't think
I can date someone named Fangs.

27:47.457 --> 27:49.834
-He's a good-looking dude.
Oh, my God.

27:49.918 --> 27:52.253
Please. What do you know, you big lug?

27:57.926 --> 28:01.471
Hey, so, how did you two, uh,
get to be friends, anyway?

28:02.138 --> 28:04.849
-Uh... We, um...

28:06.935 --> 28:08.728
-We were...
Mm-hm.

28:09.312 --> 28:10.522
Lab partners.

28:10.897 --> 28:11.773
Biology.

28:12.899 --> 28:13.733
Oh. Hm.

28:25.370 --> 28:27.330
<i>âª Cold, cold blood âª</i>

28:35.380 --> 28:37.465
<i>âª Cold, cold blood âª</i>

28:51.354 --> 28:53.022
<i>âª Cold blood âª</i>

28:54.691 --> 28:55.525
Kevin?

28:57.318 --> 28:58.153
Josie.

28:59.362 --> 29:02.657
Here to tell me more bad news?
I don't think I could take that.

29:02.741 --> 29:06.453
No, no. I had to get out of the house.

29:06.536 --> 29:08.204
So, I came here. Heh.

29:08.788 --> 29:10.874
And I saw you and, um...

29:11.624 --> 29:14.002
I'm sorry about what I said.

29:14.461 --> 29:15.295
I--

29:15.879 --> 29:20.633
It wasn't my place to do that.
I was just hurting and mad at my mom--

29:20.717 --> 29:22.427
It's okay, Josie.

29:24.095 --> 29:25.013
Um...

29:25.680 --> 29:27.724
You Are you here with somebody?

29:32.187 --> 29:36.775
Let me guess,
some cherry cola for Cheryl Bombshell.

29:37.358 --> 29:40.945
Oh, my God. What do you want?
And why do you keep stalking me?

29:41.029 --> 29:42.071
I'm not.

29:42.155 --> 29:45.283
I came to see this movie with Fangs
and he bailed on me.

29:48.495 --> 29:49.537
Are you okay?

29:51.206 --> 29:52.707
I'm alone at the movies.

29:53.374 --> 29:55.752
And I'm trying to stay away from my mother

29:55.835 --> 29:58.546
who has turned our house
into her sexual playpen.

30:00.548 --> 30:01.382
So, no.

30:02.717 --> 30:03.760
I am really not.

30:04.302 --> 30:08.389
Well, I was gonna go grab a seat alone,

30:08.473 --> 30:12.644
unless you want some company,
but no pressure.

30:18.858 --> 30:21.694
<i>But these last few years,</i>

30:21.778 --> 30:24.447
<i>it's almost like I could feel you</i>

30:25.740 --> 30:28.451
<i>You are still you, Simon.</i>

30:29.536 --> 30:34.123
<i>You get to be more you</i>
<i>than you have been in a very long time.</i>

30:34.707 --> 30:36.709
<i>You deserve everything you want.</i>

30:37.710 --> 30:40.255
I have a hotel on Park Place.
Okay.

30:40.338 --> 30:43.716
Which brings your total to $1500.

30:44.217 --> 30:46.135
Sorry, B. It's nothing personal.

30:46.219 --> 30:48.346
Yeah, I know. It's just business.

30:48.429 --> 30:49.430
Mm-hm.

30:52.934 --> 30:54.143
Ew, it's my mom.

30:54.561 --> 30:55.979
-No.

30:56.062 --> 30:57.272
-No.
-No.

30:57.355 --> 30:59.315
What if it's about Chic? Let me just--

31:00.733 --> 31:02.110
Hey, Mom, what's up?

31:02.694 --> 31:06.406
By the way, when are we ever gonna get
to meet Chic?

31:06.489 --> 31:08.449
I actually did, before we left. And

31:12.328 --> 31:14.163
Honestly, he's kind of creepy.

31:14.747 --> 31:16.958
Guys.

31:17.041 --> 31:18.376
No, actually.

31:19.586 --> 31:25.466
My mom is freaking out because Hiram Lodge
just bought the <i>Riverdale Register</i>.

31:34.309 --> 31:37.687
My mom is losing her mind,
my dad's not answering her calls.

31:37.770 --> 31:39.022
Veronica, did you know

31:39.105 --> 31:42.483

No, Betty, of course not.

31:42.567 --> 31:45.028
-This is what I'm talking about.
-Relax, Jughead.

31:45.111 --> 31:47.822
-Don't tell me to relax.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.908
To get us out of town
while your dad does these things?

31:49.991 --> 31:51.868
Okay, now who sounds crazy?

31:51.951 --> 31:55.663
Lodge Industries has been buying
properties all over the Southside.

31:55.747 --> 31:59.959
Now he buys the town's newspaper
so people can't report on what he's doing?

32:00.043 --> 32:02.170
This is a classic gambit of criminals.

32:02.253 --> 32:04.797
-Shut up, Jughead.
-Archie, this one's simple.

32:04.881 --> 32:09.052
Even you might get this if you stopped
kissing up to Hiram for two seconds.

32:09.135 --> 32:13.556
How many times have I defended you?
And now you stab my family in the back?

32:13.640 --> 32:18.144
It sounds to me you should be mad at
your dad for selling the paper, not mine.

32:18.227 --> 32:21.189
And there's nothing evil
about buying a newspaper.

32:21.272 --> 32:25.151
He's trying to silence the free press,
keep Mrs. Cooper from coming after him.

32:25.234 --> 32:27.987
I am so sick of your vendetta
against my dad.

32:28.071 --> 32:32.367
-He's done plenty of good things.
Name one thing.

32:32.450 --> 32:34.953
-He's--
-He paid my dad's medical bills.

32:35.036 --> 32:38.039
Boy, Archie. Veronica's got you
wrapped around her little finger.

32:38.122 --> 32:39.624
And other parts of her body.

32:39.707 --> 32:42.126
Oh! I'm sorry.

32:42.210 --> 32:46.089
I'm sorry we don't spend our time being
tragic, and moping, and holding hands

32:46.172 --> 32:48.341
while watching
serial-killer documentaries.

32:48.424 --> 32:51.094
And wearing costumes to role-play
to get our rocks off.

32:55.598 --> 32:58.059
-Oh, my God.

32:58.142 --> 32:59.936
You rich folks never learn.

33:00.019 --> 33:04.107
You just keep walking around town,
flashing cash than we see in a year.

33:04.190 --> 33:06.776
We're gonna take what we want,
and then go,

33:06.859 --> 33:10.154
and if you guys behave yourselves,
nobody gets their skulls knocked in.

33:12.782 --> 33:15.868
Fine. Take what you want.
We won't give you any trouble.

33:15.952 --> 33:17.161
Where's your purse?

33:18.162 --> 33:19.622
Um, it's...

33:21.124 --> 33:21.958
In my bedroom.

33:22.709 --> 33:26.462
-Let's go to the bedroom.
-No. No way are you going with her alone.

33:26.546 --> 33:28.339
-I'll go.
Archie.

33:29.507 --> 33:31.759
It's fine. I'll be fine.

33:32.343 --> 33:33.511
We'll be right back.

33:34.053 --> 33:35.805
Everybody just needs to stay calm.

33:46.691 --> 33:47.608
It's over there.

33:48.735 --> 33:50.945
I'm just gonna pick it up, okay?

34:02.165 --> 34:03.499
Why are you doing this?

34:11.841 --> 34:13.342
You think I don't recognize you?

34:14.385 --> 34:16.804
-Shut up and get your wallet.

34:40.953 --> 34:42.914
Can we go already

34:42.997 --> 34:44.957
Yeah. I got the cash.

34:45.041 --> 34:47.710
-Then you got what you wanted.
-Not everything.

34:48.419 --> 34:51.214
Not yet. Why don't you all get down
on your knees?

34:51.756 --> 34:54.509
-Come on, man. Let's not do this.
-Shut up.

34:54.592 --> 34:56.636
I said, on your knees.

34:57.178 --> 34:58.930
Hands behind your backs.

34:59.514 --> 35:00.473
Do it!

35:15.071 --> 35:16.364
It's a nice cabin.

35:17.657 --> 35:19.408
Sorry we have to make such a mess in it.

35:22.120 --> 35:23.121
The hell is that?

35:23.788 --> 35:28.334
That would be the security company calling
to check on the alarm I hit in my bedroom.

35:28.417 --> 35:32.839
I'd say you have 30 seconds to run
before this place is swarming with guards

35:32.922 --> 35:35.007
who will shoot first
and ask questions never.

35:39.846 --> 35:41.848
Screw you, rich bitch.

35:44.308 --> 35:46.144
Archie, don't!
No, Arch!

36:03.786 --> 36:07.707
Andre. There were some other guys
with him. Did you see them?

36:07.790 --> 36:10.543
Go back to the cabin.
I'll take care it from here.

36:11.836 --> 36:13.588
-I said...

36:14.297 --> 36:15.506
I'll take care of it.

36:46.537 --> 36:50.374
First of all, thank you, Mom,
and Sheriff Keller,

36:50.458 --> 36:52.585
for coming to meet me and Kevin.

36:52.668 --> 36:55.671
-We promise you this isn't a trap.
-It's that--

36:56.422 --> 37:00.384
Kevin and I were talking
after the movie and we thought--

37:00.843 --> 37:03.095
This conversation is bigger
than just two people.

37:03.763 --> 37:06.224
It's bigger than the people
in this booth, even.

37:06.807 --> 37:09.101
And it's probably gonna be a long one.

37:09.185 --> 37:12.980
So, we should get started.

37:23.908 --> 37:26.911
You may think you've mastered
the art of silent tears,

37:26.994 --> 37:31.123
-but I saw you crying during that movie.
-I never cry at movies.

37:31.207 --> 37:32.959
Real life's tragic enough.

37:34.252 --> 37:36.921
But when Simon's mom said

37:37.004 --> 37:39.590
he used to be such a carefree kid
growing up,

37:40.258 --> 37:45.471
and then, at a certain point,
he stopped being that happy kid,

37:45.930 --> 37:49.058
-because he was hiding a secret, it just--
-Cheryl.

37:51.102 --> 37:54.438
Everyone thinks I'm this loveless monster.

37:55.523 --> 37:56.816
But it isn't true.

37:59.610 --> 38:01.070
I loved someone...

38:02.488 --> 38:03.656
who loved me.

38:05.825 --> 38:07.368
And my mother destroyed it.

38:08.160 --> 38:09.745
You mean your brother Jason?

38:11.580 --> 38:13.374
I heard how close you guys were.

38:14.083 --> 38:16.127
No. Not Jay-Jay.

38:17.795 --> 38:18.629
Her...

38:19.338 --> 38:22.258
Her name was Heather.

38:27.013 --> 38:29.307
She was my best friend in junior high.

38:30.474 --> 38:32.852
She used to sleep over every weekend.

38:33.853 --> 38:37.523
Until one night, my mother caught us
in the same bed.

38:38.566 --> 38:41.652
She said I was deviant.

38:42.945 --> 38:44.905
Cheryl, I am so sorry.

38:45.906 --> 38:48.242
But you have to know your mother's wrong.

38:49.201 --> 38:51.037
You're not loveless.

38:51.120 --> 38:53.664
You're not deviant, okay?

38:56.417 --> 38:59.045
You're sensational.

39:02.089 --> 39:06.677
âª <i>Cross my heart, hope to die</i> âª

39:08.387 --> 39:11.098
Thank God Andre didn't leave
when I told him to.

39:13.559 --> 39:15.186
Thank God you didn't catch up

39:15.269 --> 39:18.773
to that hillbilly in the woods.
He might've killed you, Archie.

39:18.856 --> 39:20.524
And that would've been--

39:34.789 --> 39:38.000
<i>Archie didn't say any more</i>
<i>about what happened that terrible night.</i>

39:38.918 --> 39:40.961
<i>At least not to us.</i>

39:44.757 --> 39:47.176
Veronica told me
what happened at the cabin.

39:47.676 --> 39:50.179
And then Andre told me the rest.

39:50.262 --> 39:53.391
You did the right thing telling those boys
to take what they wanted and get out.

39:53.474 --> 39:54.850
It was a smart choice.

39:56.685 --> 39:58.187
It was the only choice.

40:00.398 --> 40:03.275
-Thank you for saying that, Mr. Lodge.
-Yeah.

40:08.280 --> 40:12.743
What happened between Andre
and that miscreant...

40:14.537 --> 40:15.871
Did that bother you?

40:17.581 --> 40:19.959
What Andre did?

40:23.712 --> 40:25.840
The night we stopped the Black Hood...

40:27.925 --> 40:30.428
there's only one thing that I regret.

40:31.595 --> 40:32.471
I had him.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.891
The man who tried to kill my dad,
I had him.

40:37.810 --> 40:39.019
And I hesitated.

40:40.980 --> 40:43.566
He might've gotten away
if it wasn't for Sheriff Keller.

40:44.150 --> 40:47.361
When it comes to protecting yourself
or your loved ones...

40:48.863 --> 40:51.031
you never, ever, hesitate.

41:05.713 --> 41:08.549
You can stop worrying now. I'm home.

41:10.050 --> 41:12.845
As we were driving back from The Shining,
I was thinking...

41:13.262 --> 41:15.806
there's more than one kind
of home invasion.

41:15.890 --> 41:17.892
It's not always fast and violent.

41:17.975 --> 41:20.936
Sometimes we open the door,
and we let the intruder in ourselves.

41:22.313 --> 41:23.481
What do you mean?

41:25.274 --> 41:28.319
Before we left,
I got a really weird vibe from Chic.

41:30.488 --> 41:31.780
Just be careful, okay?

41:38.704 --> 41:40.164
-Bye.
-Bye.

41:45.461 --> 41:47.755
<i>And so this chapter comes full circle,</i>

41:48.380 --> 41:49.715
<i>ending where it began,</i>

41:50.257 --> 41:54.553
<i>with a girl in a house</i>
<i>that was far from sweet.</i>
