00:02.400 --> 00:05.290
The Italian gangs and the Jewish gangs
have been at war in London.

00:05.360 --> 00:08.125
<i>The Jews have been having
the worst of it. They need allies.</i>

00:08.200 --> 00:09.281
Tell us your plan.

00:09.560 --> 00:11.722
I can offer you 100 good men.

00:13.880 --> 00:16.565
Get him out of there, get him back!

00:17.320 --> 00:18.481
Arthur killed a boy.

00:20.600 --> 00:23.444
Polly, these are the files
for Michael and Anna Gray.

00:23.520 --> 00:24.806
Your daughter is dead.

00:24.880 --> 00:28.362
But, Pol, Michael is alive.

00:28.440 --> 00:30.329
I'm looking for someone
called Elizabeth Gray.

00:30.400 --> 00:32.084
What do you want with Elizabeth Gray?

00:32.159 --> 00:33.685
I think she might be my mother.

00:35.640 --> 00:38.644
<i>There's an old friend of ours
coming back to the city.</i>

00:38.720 --> 00:41.451
He's head of some secret department,

00:41.520 --> 00:43.045
the Irish Desk.

00:47.520 --> 00:57.545
<b><font color="#004F8C">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

02:02.120 --> 02:05.363
He was murdered this morning
in a street show in the Patch.

02:05.440 --> 02:08.683
He was Irish. Is he a person of interest
to your department, sir?

02:08.759 --> 02:10.524
Do you read the papers?

02:10.600 --> 02:12.284
Birmingham papers.

02:12.760 --> 02:14.842
I recommend the <i>Daily Mail.</i>

02:14.920 --> 02:16.809
It will broaden your mind.

02:18.440 --> 02:22.570
Now, if you read the national press,
you would know

02:22.640 --> 02:26.122
that the king has offered
the rebel Irish a treaty.

02:26.200 --> 02:28.441
Now, some of the Fenians
want to accept it.

02:28.520 --> 02:30.363
The IRA do not.

02:30.440 --> 02:35.128
Now, the IRA have a long
and glorious relationship

02:35.200 --> 02:36.281
with the garrotte.

02:37.440 --> 02:38.726
Oh, dear.

02:39.120 --> 02:41.691
Are they fighting amongst
themselves, are they, sir?

02:45.040 --> 02:46.610
- That will be all.
-Right, sir.

02:46.680 --> 02:49.650
Oh, Moss, I'm going to be up and down
from London quite a bit.

02:49.720 --> 02:52.041
I'm going to need some lodgings.
Can you help me with that?

02:52.120 --> 02:53.645
Well, you wouldn't want
to stay in the lodgings

02:53.720 --> 02:56.041
you had last time then, sir, eh?

02:56.480 --> 02:58.209
Too many bad memories, I suppose.

02:58.280 --> 03:00.009
You should understand, Moss,

03:00.080 --> 03:03.687
I have no regrets about
my previous mission in this city.

03:04.240 --> 03:05.241
No, sir?

03:05.640 --> 03:10.726
I imagine you boys
have quite a laugh at my expense.

03:10.800 --> 03:11.961
A laugh, sir?

03:12.040 --> 03:15.089
You think it's funny
that I developed feelings?

03:15.640 --> 03:17.130
No idea what you're talking about, sir.

03:17.200 --> 03:22.001
I have no regrets about what
happened with Miss Burgess.

03:22.080 --> 03:24.321
No "bad memories".

03:25.920 --> 03:27.285
Right, sir.

03:31.080 --> 03:33.162
He's losing his bloody mind.

03:51.480 --> 03:52.481
Next.

03:56.360 --> 03:57.361
Next.

04:14.800 --> 04:15.926
All right, then.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.843
Name?

04:17.920 --> 04:19.285
The Digbeth Kid.

04:21.200 --> 04:22.804
The Dig...

04:22.880 --> 04:24.245
What are you? A boxer?

04:25.800 --> 04:28.087
Digbeth Kid like Billy the Kid.

04:32.720 --> 04:34.404
Spend a lot of time at the pictures, eh?

04:35.600 --> 04:37.807
Cowboy pictures? Tom Mix?

04:37.880 --> 04:39.006
Yeah?

04:42.480 --> 04:43.561
What are you...

04:43.640 --> 04:46.564
Wait, wait. It's not a real gun.

04:47.280 --> 04:49.681
- Let's have a look then, eh?
-It's made of wood.

04:55.040 --> 04:58.123
Bang.Bang.

04:58.720 --> 04:59.960
Very nice.

05:00.360 --> 05:02.647
Where did you get the gun belt?

05:03.080 --> 05:06.004
My sister made it out of
an old blacksmith's apron.

05:06.720 --> 05:08.210
My mum did most of the stitching.

05:08.760 --> 05:09.921
She's not my real mum, but...

05:10.000 --> 05:12.002
She does what mothers do.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.005
So she made you a gun belt.

05:14.360 --> 05:15.930
All right then, mother's boy.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.923
There's the door. On you go.
We're looking for...

05:19.880 --> 05:20.927
Have you ever been arrested?

05:21.000 --> 05:22.286
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

05:24.840 --> 05:26.171
- No.
-Good.

05:27.440 --> 05:31.001
You're the first bloke we've had in
here today with no criminal record.

05:31.080 --> 05:33.367
Arthur, we can stand him up.

05:33.440 --> 05:34.726
Do you know what that means?

05:36.080 --> 05:40.449
The new Home Secretary wants something
done about illegal gambling.

05:40.520 --> 05:42.045
Damn right.

05:42.120 --> 05:43.451
About bloody time.

05:43.520 --> 05:47.445
So we help our coppers make their quota
of convictions by having men stood up

05:47.520 --> 05:48.965
to be arrested.

05:49.040 --> 05:51.520
First offence, you'll get a week inside.

05:52.040 --> 05:54.771
We'll give you five quid
for your trouble.

05:54.840 --> 05:56.888
How does that sound, cowboy?

05:56.960 --> 05:58.086
Yeah.

06:00.360 --> 06:04.081
Good. Write your address down
for Finn on your way out.

06:07.160 --> 06:08.286
I can't write.

06:08.360 --> 06:10.681
That's all right, Finn can't read.

06:10.760 --> 06:11.761
Don't worry.

06:11.840 --> 06:14.446
Just tell him your address
and we'll send someone round.

06:14.880 --> 06:18.566
If the sheriff don't run you
out of town first.

06:25.560 --> 06:26.846
Good man.

06:28.320 --> 06:31.767
- Oh, I don't know, Tom. Kids these days.
-Hmm.

06:34.080 --> 06:35.650
They didn't fight.

06:35.720 --> 06:37.529
So they're different.

06:38.120 --> 06:39.645
They stay kids.

06:43.680 --> 06:45.045
How was it?

06:45.560 --> 06:48.404
I was starving,
so I would have eaten anything.

06:48.920 --> 06:50.888
But really it was super.

06:52.560 --> 06:53.846
Super.

06:56.320 --> 06:58.687
So, uh, are you a cook?

06:59.920 --> 07:01.763
Not a cook. No.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.730
The man who came to the house,

07:10.800 --> 07:13.565
he was driving a posh car.
He looks rich.

07:14.160 --> 07:15.764
What does he do?

07:16.760 --> 07:19.001
- He works with horses.
-Really?

07:20.240 --> 07:21.241
I love horses.

07:22.440 --> 07:24.124
- I've got a bay mare.
-No!

07:24.200 --> 07:26.123
I ride it all the time.

07:27.640 --> 07:28.641
Then it's in the blood.

07:34.240 --> 07:35.844
I've got about a million questions.

07:36.280 --> 07:37.520
So do I.

07:38.480 --> 07:40.562
I've had different pictures in my head.

07:40.640 --> 07:42.563
Well, here I am.

08:04.760 --> 08:07.411
It's all right that it's me, isn't it?

08:08.080 --> 08:10.048
I don't have any choice.

08:11.840 --> 08:14.605
I mean, you are who you are, aren't you?

08:15.760 --> 08:17.364
We don't choose.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.290
And that's it.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.529
Yeah, that's right.

08:25.040 --> 08:26.769
God gave you to me.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.209
People took you away.

08:34.320 --> 08:37.210
And it is all right
that it's me, isn't it?

08:39.039 --> 08:40.405
In a place like this.

08:42.799 --> 08:43.801
I thought it would be worse.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.843
Run for the hills!
It's the Digbeth Kid!

08:48.920 --> 08:52.163
Get out of town, kid,
or I will shoot your fucking head off!

08:52.240 --> 08:54.049
Time's up!

08:54.120 --> 08:55.929
- You're dead, go down.
- John!

09:09.800 --> 09:11.211
All right then, Polly.

09:11.920 --> 09:13.285
Who's this?

09:14.400 --> 09:17.483
Gentlemen, this is your cousin.

09:18.680 --> 09:20.284
Polly's son, Michael.

09:29.080 --> 09:30.161
Pleased to meet you.

09:30.240 --> 09:31.241
John.

09:31.680 --> 09:33.170
I'm Arthur. You've already met me.

09:33.240 --> 09:36.323
I used to throw you out of the window,
so John could catch you.

09:36.400 --> 09:40.200
I used to put you in a shoebox
and kick you down Watery Lane.

09:41.160 --> 09:43.447
I bet you're glad to be back.

09:43.520 --> 09:45.363
I don't remember any of it.

09:45.440 --> 09:47.363
All I remember is the day
they took me away.

10:00.040 --> 10:02.122
Well, you're here now, son.

10:03.840 --> 10:05.171
Welcome to the Shelby family.

10:05.240 --> 10:06.844
Later on, we'll show you the ropes.

10:06.920 --> 10:08.922
Hmm. Yeah, we'll show you what's what.

10:11.080 --> 10:13.367
Let's leave him be for now, eh?

10:13.880 --> 10:15.370
Come on, boys.

10:16.520 --> 10:18.488
- Nice suit.

10:23.720 --> 10:25.245
They seem nice.

10:34.280 --> 10:37.045
Here he is, Mr Inconspicuous.

10:37.120 --> 10:39.930
Corporal Billy Kitchen.
Bloody grand to see you.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.045
How are you feeling?

10:42.120 --> 10:43.531
I've just come out of bandages myself.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.682
Ready for active service.

10:45.760 --> 10:47.330
Thanks for seeing me here, Tommy.

10:47.400 --> 10:48.481
It's all right, Bill.

10:48.560 --> 10:49.686
You don't have to stand in line for us.

10:50.080 --> 10:51.969
It's men like you
we're looking for, Billy.

10:52.040 --> 10:53.929
But you have to pass the medical first.

10:55.120 --> 10:59.045
Sheffield mob showed up
at Wincanton trotting track.

10:59.120 --> 11:00.724
I took a bullet.

11:04.120 --> 11:05.929
When do the bandages come off?

11:06.000 --> 11:07.764
When I take 'em off.

11:08.440 --> 11:10.124
One week. Not before.

11:10.200 --> 11:11.850
You'll smell no rot.

11:12.160 --> 11:13.924
There's no gangrene.

11:14.920 --> 11:17.048
It's been a long time. Eh, Billy?

11:18.400 --> 11:19.890
What did you do with your medals?

11:20.360 --> 11:23.603
Threw them in the cut. Same as you.

11:24.960 --> 11:29.045
It was never a hardship having you
Black Country boys on our left flank.

11:29.560 --> 11:31.483
And you Brummies did all right
on our right.

11:31.560 --> 11:32.925
Damn right.

11:34.480 --> 11:36.323
I want you to be the head
of a brigade, Bill.

11:37.640 --> 11:40.530
It'll be Brigadier Kitchen from now on.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.331
You'll have 100 men under your command.

11:44.680 --> 11:47.809
And now we've got a member of
the Kitchen family on the payroll,

11:47.880 --> 11:51.043
maybe your cousins and brothers will let
our boats pass through the Black Country

11:51.120 --> 11:52.849
without being held up and robbed.

11:53.760 --> 11:55.364
I don't know what you're talking about.

11:56.200 --> 11:57.326
Go home, Bill.

11:57.400 --> 12:00.529
Round up any good men you can trust
and put the word out.

12:00.600 --> 12:03.729
Black Country boys and Brummie boys
are on the same side again.

12:03.800 --> 12:05.086
That'll be the bloody day.

12:05.160 --> 12:07.367
Well, this is the bloody day.

12:09.600 --> 12:12.410
London, man. There for the taking.

12:26.560 --> 12:28.562
Tommy, I need to use the telephone.

12:28.640 --> 12:31.086
Polly said you had one in the pub.

12:32.280 --> 12:34.886
All right, be quick. I have business.

12:37.400 --> 12:38.401
Sir.

12:38.480 --> 12:40.721
Polly said you own this place.

12:41.200 --> 12:43.123
She said you own lots
of different businesses.

12:43.200 --> 12:45.441
You call her Polly or Mum?

12:45.520 --> 12:47.568
I can't get used to calling her Mum yet.

12:51.400 --> 12:52.561
Who are you calling?

12:52.640 --> 12:54.927
My mother. I mean...

12:55.000 --> 12:56.809
I know what you mean.

12:57.840 --> 12:59.490
And what are you going to tell her?

12:59.560 --> 13:01.210
I'm going to tell her where I am.

13:01.720 --> 13:05.042
And now you're going to tell her
you're going home.

13:07.080 --> 13:09.162
Polly said I could stay for a few days.

13:09.240 --> 13:12.084
- You want to stay?
- I've only just arrived.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.490
What age are you Michael?

13:17.560 --> 13:18.641
Seventeen.

13:18.720 --> 13:22.008
Seventeen. Which means
it's not up to you, right?

13:22.080 --> 13:24.686
I'm 18 in a few weeks.
I make up my own mind.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.762
You smoke?

13:26.840 --> 13:27.887
No.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.001
Drink?

13:36.760 --> 13:38.762
You're going to call your mother,

13:38.840 --> 13:41.411
going to tell her you're getting
the next train home.

13:41.480 --> 13:42.641
And when you get there,

13:42.720 --> 13:44.609
you're going to write a letter to Polly
saying when you're 18,

13:44.680 --> 13:46.170
you'll come back here
and sort things out.

13:46.240 --> 13:47.844
I just told you.

13:49.280 --> 13:51.123
I make up my own mind.

13:53.560 --> 13:56.928
Do you know what we do, Michael?

13:59.120 --> 14:01.851
We, Shelbys.

14:03.520 --> 14:05.841
Yes. I think I know what you do.

14:07.440 --> 14:08.441
Yeah.

14:09.440 --> 14:11.283
You've got smart eyes.

14:12.840 --> 14:16.890
But you're young, so you think
what we do is all right.

14:18.480 --> 14:20.403
It's not all right.

14:20.480 --> 14:22.084
People get hurt.

14:24.960 --> 14:28.681
Now, call your mother
and I will drive you to the station.

14:28.760 --> 14:29.761
No.

14:36.080 --> 14:37.570
In my village,

14:38.360 --> 14:40.761
there's this little wishing well.

14:41.520 --> 14:45.684
It's made of white bricks, right
in the middle of the village green.

14:46.560 --> 14:48.881
Everybody says how pretty it is.

14:50.560 --> 14:52.289
But I swear to God,

14:53.440 --> 14:55.886
if I spend another day in that village,

14:55.960 --> 14:58.930
I'm going to blow it up with dynamite.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.005
Probably blow my hands off with it,
but it'd be worth it.

15:03.640 --> 15:07.406
Just to see
all those pretty white bricks

15:07.480 --> 15:10.086
spread over the pretty village green.

15:17.560 --> 15:18.641
Hmm.

15:23.480 --> 15:26.324
Yep. You're Polly's son, all right.

15:40.480 --> 15:42.881
All right boys, let's go to work.

15:43.960 --> 15:45.724
Let's be having it!

15:47.440 --> 15:48.930
Don't wait!

15:51.680 --> 15:53.330
Keep it moving.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.166
Move!

16:15.120 --> 16:16.485
Next lad!

16:19.560 --> 16:20.721
Name?

16:20.800 --> 16:21.926
Abbey Heath.

16:22.000 --> 16:23.161
Abbey Heath. Profession?

16:23.240 --> 16:24.241
Baker.

16:25.520 --> 16:27.727
Good lad. Fill it out and fuck off.

16:28.520 --> 16:29.806
Next lad!

16:33.240 --> 16:34.241
Name?

16:34.880 --> 16:35.927
Buddy Halls.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.480
Buddy Halls. Right. Profession?

16:38.840 --> 16:39.841
Baker.

16:40.520 --> 16:42.488
Good lad. Fill it out and fuck off.

16:44.120 --> 16:45.406
Next lad!

16:47.400 --> 16:49.050
- Name?
-Billy Kitchen.

16:49.120 --> 16:51.600
Billy Kitchen. Occupation?

16:51.680 --> 16:53.045
Head baker.

16:59.360 --> 17:00.407
Fill it out.

17:08.119 --> 17:10.406
Um, Tommy Shelby, mate.

17:10.480 --> 17:13.290
Never give power to the big man,
what did I tell you?

17:13.359 --> 17:14.406
Hmm?

17:14.480 --> 17:17.165
Never give power to the big man.

17:17.839 --> 17:18.840
Next lad!

17:21.160 --> 17:22.161
Name?

17:23.640 --> 17:27.645
All right, boys, you've now
all been enrolled as bakers

17:27.720 --> 17:30.451
in the Aerated Bread Company
of Camden Town.

17:30.520 --> 17:32.761
If anyone asks, that's what you do.

17:32.840 --> 17:34.330
You're bakers.

17:34.960 --> 17:37.884
The coppers in Camden Town
are on our side,

17:37.960 --> 17:41.885
but north or south,
you show them that piece of paper.

17:41.960 --> 17:46.249
Tell them you've come down from
north to find work, to break strikes.

17:46.760 --> 17:49.570
Tell them you're fascists,
if you have to.

17:50.120 --> 17:54.728
We're finding lodgings for you, but
for now you'll sleep here in the bakery.

17:55.360 --> 17:58.728
But don't touch any of the bread,
it'll most likely explode.

18:01.160 --> 18:02.525
Any questions?

18:04.240 --> 18:05.241
Yes?

18:06.080 --> 18:07.570
I haven't even seen any bread.

18:43.920 --> 18:45.410
He'll wake up.

18:46.160 --> 18:50.529
Granted, he won't have any teeth left,
but he will be a wiser man for it.

18:53.160 --> 18:56.687
And the last thing he will remember
is your funny little joke. Won't he?

19:05.000 --> 19:06.161
Right!

19:07.880 --> 19:09.609
There are fucking rules here.

19:09.680 --> 19:13.480
Yeah, there are fucking rules
for a fucking reason.

19:13.560 --> 19:16.689
Quite simply, they have to be obeyed.
All right?

19:18.760 --> 19:20.364
Rule number one.

19:21.040 --> 19:26.490
The distinction between bread and rum,
yeah, is not discussed.

19:29.480 --> 19:31.084
Rule number two.

19:34.560 --> 19:38.690
Anything, right,
that your superior officer

19:38.760 --> 19:44.847
says to you or any of your other fucking
superior officers say to you, yeah?

19:44.920 --> 19:47.287
Not discussed!

19:50.720 --> 19:56.090
Rule number three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, I don't care.

19:56.160 --> 20:00.165
For the rest of your fucking
miserable measly lives, yeah?

20:00.240 --> 20:03.244
Because I, like you,

20:03.320 --> 20:06.847
am also a complete fucking sodomite.

20:12.280 --> 20:13.725
Jewish women.

20:16.160 --> 20:17.889
You do not go anywhere near them

20:17.960 --> 20:21.487
because Jewish women for you
are off the fucking menu.

20:23.640 --> 20:25.051
I think that's fair.

20:32.760 --> 20:34.649
Hmm.

20:45.240 --> 20:46.605
Hmm.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.762
All right, that's it, yeah.

20:49.520 --> 20:51.761
Forgive me, I interrupted you.

20:58.880 --> 21:00.325
Pick him up.

21:07.400 --> 21:10.529
Get them out of here
and make this fucking work.

21:14.920 --> 21:16.763
Don't fucking wait!

21:16.840 --> 21:19.605
You're meant to be fucking soldiers!

21:19.680 --> 21:21.728
You're a fucking disgrace!

21:23.200 --> 21:24.247
Go!

22:19.960 --> 22:21.962
You've got a key?

22:22.800 --> 22:23.926
I kept a spare.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.001
Give it to me.

22:32.280 --> 22:34.487
Could do with some paint, eh?

22:34.560 --> 22:36.688
Yeah, when I decide.

22:44.520 --> 22:45.851
What is it that you want, Tommy?

22:45.920 --> 22:48.002
Just came by to say hello.

22:49.680 --> 22:52.524
Tommy Shelby never goes
anywhere for no reason.

22:53.920 --> 22:55.365
Fine.

22:57.600 --> 23:01.889
I've got 800 pounds left
in the Shelby property fund,

23:01.960 --> 23:04.770
and I need someone down here
to look for suitable properties.

23:05.120 --> 23:06.121
To rent?

23:07.600 --> 23:08.601
Yes.

23:09.640 --> 23:11.244
To poor people.

23:11.320 --> 23:12.765
Ten to a room.

23:12.840 --> 23:14.888
No repairs, no water.

23:14.960 --> 23:18.806
And if they complain, you just send
Arthur and the boys round.

23:19.920 --> 23:22.924
You know, I give advice
down at the library.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.321
Families thrown on the street.

23:26.480 --> 23:28.562
It's men like you we're fighting.

23:32.040 --> 23:35.567
Well, anyway, I was just passing.
Thanks for the tea.

23:39.680 --> 23:40.681
Tommy.

23:45.760 --> 23:49.446
There are always men outside
watching the house.

23:49.520 --> 23:52.091
Yeah. Gangsters of the worst kind.

23:52.160 --> 23:53.366
But they're there to keep you safe.

23:53.440 --> 23:55.488
No there are others.
They look like coppers.

23:57.760 --> 23:59.285
Well, they're on your side as well.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.005
I don't have a fucking side.

24:02.080 --> 24:04.128
Ada, yes, you do.

24:05.760 --> 24:09.446
And, anyway, if I thought there
was no-one watching the house,

24:09.520 --> 24:11.170
I couldn't sleep.

24:12.120 --> 24:14.009
Cheerio then.

24:29.400 --> 24:32.006
That was great. Well done.

24:32.080 --> 24:33.684
Out we get then.

24:43.920 --> 24:46.082
This house is mine.

24:48.960 --> 24:51.088
I've taken on a maid.

24:51.160 --> 24:53.049
She's made up the big room for you.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.281
Come on, let's have a look.

25:04.560 --> 25:07.245
I thought we could spend the week here.

25:11.040 --> 25:13.771
You know, get to know each other again.

25:19.400 --> 25:21.448
I've got ham. Do you like ham?

25:22.400 --> 25:23.765
I like ham, yes.

25:27.040 --> 25:28.724
- I've got a maid...
-Yes, you said.

25:31.560 --> 25:33.085
She's upstairs.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.365
She can give us some tea.

25:36.440 --> 25:39.444
Look, I ring this bell. Watch.

25:45.040 --> 25:46.041
Yes, madam?

25:51.320 --> 25:52.446
I think we'd like some tea.

26:00.080 --> 26:01.206
You get used to it.

26:45.440 --> 26:48.250
The cleaning job's gone.
Vacancy's filled.

26:48.680 --> 26:50.364
I'm not a cleaner.

26:52.200 --> 26:54.965
But I have come to clean away some dirt.

26:59.880 --> 27:02.247
Why don't you put that away
before it goes off?

27:02.320 --> 27:05.483
You killed my son!

27:05.560 --> 27:08.166
You Peaky bastard!

27:10.120 --> 27:11.281
You beat him

27:11.360 --> 27:15.081
and beat him and beat him.

27:17.040 --> 27:18.690
Your son was a boxer.

27:18.760 --> 27:20.250
No!

27:22.800 --> 27:24.211
He was a boy

27:26.200 --> 27:29.727
who got into a ring with an animal.

27:32.160 --> 27:33.400
Yeah, ain't that the truth.

27:33.480 --> 27:35.289
I've come to stop you

27:37.320 --> 27:41.211
because the coppers
and nobody else will.

27:50.120 --> 27:52.771
If you're going to use it,

27:52.840 --> 27:55.002
point that thing at my head.

27:56.120 --> 27:58.282
That's where the trouble is.

28:00.240 --> 28:03.050
Gut-shot soldiers take
half a day to die.

28:04.480 --> 28:05.970
I've seen 'em.

28:06.560 --> 28:10.531
Walking around with their guts
in their arms like dirty washing.

28:12.560 --> 28:14.688
Hold that gun up and do it!

28:14.760 --> 28:16.524
Fucking do it!

28:17.360 --> 28:18.521
Do it!

28:32.760 --> 28:34.171
I'm going to finish my drink.

28:39.960 --> 28:41.530
You can finish it with me, if you like.

29:15.600 --> 29:18.001
Now, look. Look at me.

29:20.680 --> 29:22.330
We've got a fund.

29:23.960 --> 29:25.803
For you. You'll get paid weekly.

29:30.120 --> 29:32.646
I know it won't bring back your son.

29:35.480 --> 29:36.891
I know that.

29:39.720 --> 29:41.484
You have other sons.

29:44.200 --> 29:45.406
You do.

29:46.360 --> 29:48.362
And we'll find them work.

29:49.080 --> 29:51.082
And you won't have to work.

29:51.160 --> 29:53.561
- You'll be...

30:01.240 --> 30:05.928
Somebody has got
to stop you people.

30:28.120 --> 30:29.724
Who broke the fucking mirror?

30:30.200 --> 30:32.441
Seven years' bad luck, that is.

30:39.840 --> 30:42.127
There'll be another
four boatloads tomorrow.

30:42.800 --> 30:45.610
What's up, Charlie? Business is good.

30:45.680 --> 30:48.445
This isn't business,
this is bloody work.

30:48.960 --> 30:53.522
Cigarettes and booze is all right,
but this manufactured stuff, it's heavy.

30:53.960 --> 30:55.485
I'm not even sure it's stolen.

30:57.240 --> 30:59.720
Some of it is legally purchased.

30:59.800 --> 31:01.529
One day, all of it will be.

31:02.200 --> 31:04.407
It's like having a fucking job.

31:04.480 --> 31:06.050
Hey! Easy with them fan belts.

31:07.880 --> 31:11.089
I'll wipe that smile off your face.
I want another pound a boat.

31:13.920 --> 31:14.921
Done.

31:17.720 --> 31:19.324
You don't even fight me any more.

31:21.160 --> 31:24.767
And it's no sport getting through
the Black Country with this truce.

31:24.840 --> 31:27.889
They just fucking wave
at you from the bank.

31:27.960 --> 31:30.201
Well, just wave back, eh?

31:31.480 --> 31:33.926
And all these fucking cars.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.526
When did you last ride a horse, Tom?

31:48.480 --> 31:50.721
--Uh.

31:51.240 --> 31:53.720
These are just dry, Mr Campbell.

31:54.720 --> 31:56.245
Major Campbell.

31:56.640 --> 31:58.005
Beg pardon?

31:58.680 --> 32:00.364
It doesn't matter.

32:06.120 --> 32:08.885
Are there any other Irishmen
lodging in this house?

32:08.960 --> 32:13.010
No, Mr Campbell,
I keep a respectable house.

32:13.080 --> 32:16.766
With your special exception,
I have no Irish here.

32:19.720 --> 32:23.247
Well, let me know
if any come enquiring after rooms.

32:24.600 --> 32:27.888
Even if you turn them away,
let me know, would you?

32:28.320 --> 32:30.607
You're not expecting trouble, I hope.

32:30.680 --> 32:33.809
They only said you was
a policeman of some sort.

32:33.880 --> 32:36.611
No. I'm not expecting any trouble.

32:38.480 --> 32:43.930
Is there a cafe nearby that
serves chops? Lamb or pork?

32:44.520 --> 32:47.205
There is a chophouse two streets away.

32:47.280 --> 32:50.011
But I myself serve sandwiches.

32:50.080 --> 32:52.242
Egg and cress, or ham.

32:53.200 --> 32:54.884
Or anything that pleases you.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.162
No. No. No.

32:59.240 --> 33:02.562
I, I think I'll go out and get some air.

33:13.880 --> 33:16.008
Our scheduled meeting
is not until Sunday.

33:17.280 --> 33:19.567
I decided to bring it forward.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.844
You just wanted to show me that
you know where I live, isn't that it?

33:22.920 --> 33:25.161
Am I supposed to be impressed?

33:26.200 --> 33:29.522
You know, Mr Churchill was impressed.

33:30.480 --> 33:31.891
Yes, he was.

33:33.200 --> 33:35.407
All my demands have been met.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.206
Did he tell you?

33:38.840 --> 33:39.841
Yes.

33:40.480 --> 33:44.485
Yes. We had a meeting
and your letter was read aloud.

33:45.760 --> 33:48.764
As a matter of fact, there was quite
a lot of hilarity at the meeting.

33:48.840 --> 33:51.889
- The gentlemen all found it quite funny.

33:51.960 --> 33:54.486
I see, the gentlemen found it funny.

33:55.280 --> 34:00.605
Tell me this, Mr Campbell, do the
gentlemen sometimes find you funny?

34:06.760 --> 34:10.242
We will discuss our business on Sunday,

34:10.320 --> 34:13.210
on the agreed day, at the allotted time,

34:13.280 --> 34:16.489
and at the place that has
already been determined.

34:17.760 --> 34:20.922
You have made your point.
Good night, Mr Shelby.

34:22.400 --> 34:26.199
There was another reason
I came to see you tonight.

34:26.280 --> 34:29.601
I just didn't want you
to be made a fool of, is all.

34:30.360 --> 34:34.922
The lodgings chosen for you
by the police department,

34:35.920 --> 34:37.728
how shall I put this?

34:38.480 --> 34:43.646
Well, your landlady used to run the most
famous whorehouse in Stechford.

34:44.560 --> 34:46.527
She's only semi-retired.

34:47.639 --> 34:50.643
I bet the gentlemen
would find that funny, eh?

34:55.120 --> 34:58.727
Told to you in the spirit
of friendship and co-operation.

35:00.600 --> 35:02.125
See you Sunday!

35:03.480 --> 35:05.767
- Name?
-Digbeth Kid.

35:05.840 --> 35:06.921
Your real name.

35:08.120 --> 35:09.610
Harold Hancox.

35:11.880 --> 35:13.120
Profession?

35:14.240 --> 35:15.321
Illegal bookmaker.

35:16.200 --> 35:18.168
You don't admit that.

35:18.240 --> 35:20.641
You say something like,
"Umbrella mender".

35:20.720 --> 35:23.849
And then we decide you're lying
and then we arrest you.

35:24.720 --> 35:25.767
Umbrella mender.

35:28.920 --> 35:32.003
You were found
in possession of betting slips,

35:32.080 --> 35:34.765
race cards and ticker tape.

35:34.840 --> 35:36.080
Any explanation?

35:37.680 --> 35:38.681
No.

35:39.120 --> 35:40.121
No.

35:40.680 --> 35:42.170
"No.

35:42.240 --> 35:44.811
"I have no explanation

35:44.880 --> 35:48.680
"for my possession
of those items, officer."

35:49.800 --> 35:52.804
Take him down, will you?
I'll fill in the rest myself.

35:52.880 --> 35:54.245
Come on, son.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.603
Bloody hellfire.

36:19.800 --> 36:21.723
You've killed him, huh?

36:22.600 --> 36:25.285
As I've explained,
he's not easy to get at.

36:25.360 --> 36:27.442
He's got an army round him.

36:28.120 --> 36:29.531
But when the time is right...

36:32.120 --> 36:33.849
The time is right. It's right now.

36:33.920 --> 36:37.686
When he's away from
his familiar territory, I will take him.

36:40.440 --> 36:41.726
- So what do you want?
-We heard from a guard

36:41.800 --> 36:44.724
at Winson Green prison that one of
their bookies has just been put inside.

36:45.160 --> 36:47.049
Kid called Harold Hancox.

36:47.120 --> 36:48.884
We could make a point.

36:48.960 --> 36:52.009
How many bakers is there
in Camden Town now?

36:53.040 --> 36:56.010
There are a lot of bakers
in Camden Town, Mr Sabini,

36:56.080 --> 36:59.721
but, as I have said, we don't as yet
have a definite number.

36:59.800 --> 37:01.768
Who won the 4:15 at Chepstow?

37:01.840 --> 37:03.285
Ragman.

37:03.360 --> 37:05.203
- Where's my dry cleaning?
-It's been collected.

37:05.280 --> 37:07.089
Who won the 3:50 at Kempton Park?

37:11.360 --> 37:13.249
- What? You don't know?
-I can find out.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.968
No need. I know already.

37:20.320 --> 37:24.928
You see, the favourites,
they're all winning.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.765
And the second favourites
are being done.

37:29.120 --> 37:30.406
He's bewitching them.

37:30.480 --> 37:31.527
Bewitching?

37:31.600 --> 37:34.126
Gypsy stuff. Herbs, potions.

37:35.840 --> 37:40.129
And he's tipping off our big punters,
so they know who's going to win.

37:41.440 --> 37:44.011
Regular customers
betraying us for profit.

37:44.080 --> 37:46.970
You'd think they'd be loyal to us.
But profit, you see,

37:52.040 --> 37:54.611
comes before race, creed, family.

37:54.680 --> 37:56.045
Results look normal to me.

37:56.120 --> 37:57.770
You see shit!

37:59.000 --> 38:04.006
Mr Sabini, if you think they're
planning to fix Northern races,

38:04.080 --> 38:06.367
we'll take no more bets
on anything north of Towcester.

38:06.440 --> 38:10.047
- I gave you a job already.
-And the job will be done.

38:10.120 --> 38:12.441
- But meantime...
-Meantime, fuck!

38:14.120 --> 38:16.088
Meantime, what do you want us
to do about the kid

38:16.160 --> 38:17.491
in the cage in Birmingham?

38:34.080 --> 38:36.924
Why would you want me
to say that out loud?

38:44.440 --> 38:46.602
Is there somebody listening?

38:53.200 --> 38:54.611
All right, I'll say it.

38:54.680 --> 38:57.570
We'll kill the Hancox kid
to send a message.

39:04.320 --> 39:08.769
Good, and then you deal
with Tommy fucking Shelby.

39:23.400 --> 39:24.765
You wanted to see me?

39:25.560 --> 39:26.607
Aye.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.286
Take off your clothes.

39:41.440 --> 39:43.204
I know what you are.

39:44.240 --> 39:46.891
So, take off your clothes.

39:53.000 --> 39:56.800
Not done in a very
gentlemanly-like way, if I may say.

39:58.320 --> 39:59.765
Indeed not.

40:08.360 --> 40:09.885
So it's true. Stop.

40:12.560 --> 40:16.246
I only wanted proof. Not satisfaction.

40:17.280 --> 40:19.044
Or indeed infection.

40:23.160 --> 40:25.083
Are you in on the joke?

40:25.960 --> 40:27.291
What joke?

40:30.320 --> 40:34.120
I have unfinished business
in this filthy city.

40:34.200 --> 40:38.285
And when the time comes,
I will finish that business.

40:38.360 --> 40:42.160
And then my wrath will
come down on all of youse.

40:43.840 --> 40:45.490
--But now,

40:46.560 --> 40:50.531
tell your friends in the police station

40:50.600 --> 40:52.807
that I know.

40:54.800 --> 40:57.041
And when my judgement comes,

40:58.320 --> 41:00.641
I'll be the one that's laughing.

41:02.400 --> 41:03.401
Get out.

41:57.800 --> 42:00.201
On the right. On the right.

42:01.560 --> 42:04.006
We haven't got all night. Come on!

42:04.840 --> 42:07.571
Let's be having you, Watkins,
in there on the right.

42:07.640 --> 42:10.769
On the right! Come on, boys!

42:18.560 --> 42:19.971
Harold Hancox?

42:26.200 --> 42:28.521
Tell everybody,

42:28.600 --> 42:32.810
this is what happens to Blinders
who come into the Green from now on.

42:32.880 --> 42:34.245
Orders of Sabini.

42:34.760 --> 42:38.162
Look, I'm not a Blinder.
I'm not a Blinder. I've been stood up.

42:38.240 --> 42:40.447
I'm not real! I'm not real!

42:40.520 --> 42:41.885
I'm not real!

43:00.080 --> 43:02.970
This had better be good
to interrupt my holiday.

43:03.040 --> 43:04.201
Where's the boy?

43:04.280 --> 43:05.281
In the back room.

43:05.360 --> 43:07.567
I only brought him because afterwards
we're going to the museum.

43:07.920 --> 43:10.207
- He wanted to come in and say hello...
-Shut up, John.

43:10.280 --> 43:12.886
There is nothing of interest
to Michael in this room.

43:15.160 --> 43:17.003
Tommy, get on with it.

43:20.600 --> 43:24.491
Last night, one of our men
had his throat cut in Winson Green.

43:25.200 --> 43:28.124
This morning, I had a telegram
saying it was Sabini who ordered it.

43:28.200 --> 43:31.044
And it says here that
Thomas Shelby's next.

43:32.040 --> 43:34.088
If our men think we can't
look after them in prison,

43:34.160 --> 43:35.241
they'll not work for us.

43:35.320 --> 43:39.006
Sabini knows that.
So we need to get the Green sorted out.

43:39.080 --> 43:41.401
Scudboat, you and one of the boys

43:41.480 --> 43:44.006
break a couple of windows,
get yourselves arrested.

43:44.080 --> 43:45.969
I'll have our coppers
get you into the Green

43:46.040 --> 43:47.849
and you can find
the bastards who did it.

43:48.360 --> 43:50.010
Instead of breaking a window,
can we pinch a car?

43:51.120 --> 43:54.329
What?
Everybody else is getting a bloody car.

43:54.400 --> 43:56.004
- I'm still on a donkey.

43:56.080 --> 43:59.084
All right, just get yourselves
fucking arrested, it doesn't matter how.

43:59.160 --> 44:00.650
And before you all laugh,

44:01.120 --> 44:02.610
a boy is dead.

44:03.240 --> 44:04.924
He was just a kid.

44:05.360 --> 44:07.522
We'll start a fund for his family, Pol.

44:07.600 --> 44:08.806
Agreed.

44:09.880 --> 44:11.450
So is that it? Can I go now?

44:11.520 --> 44:13.761
Well, as company treasurer,

44:13.840 --> 44:16.844
I need your permission
to spend 1,000 guineas.

44:17.120 --> 44:18.121
On what?

44:19.200 --> 44:20.565
On a horse.

44:22.640 --> 44:24.768
A thousand guineas on a horse?

44:24.840 --> 44:25.841
That's right.

44:30.960 --> 44:32.291
When was this decided?

44:33.400 --> 44:35.448
You've been busy with Michael.

44:35.520 --> 44:36.931
Oh, my God.

44:37.920 --> 44:41.003
So, in the absence of common sense,
you boys have had an idea.

44:41.560 --> 44:44.484
Polly, there's a thoroughbred,
quarter-Arab filly

44:44.560 --> 44:46.483
up for auction
at the Doncaster Bloodstock.

44:46.560 --> 44:48.449
What do we want with
a 1,000-guinea horse?

44:49.880 --> 44:52.565
When we make our move
on Sabini's racing pitches,

44:52.640 --> 44:54.404
any men we get into
the betting enclosure

44:54.480 --> 44:56.448
will be lifted by Sabini's police.

44:56.520 --> 44:59.205
A good racehorse is a passport
to the owner's enclosure.

44:59.280 --> 45:01.886
We'll be in there with all the toffs.

45:03.120 --> 45:05.327
- Coppers won't know where to look.
-Hmm.

45:05.400 --> 45:07.084
Yeah, the Epsom Derby, Pol.

45:07.160 --> 45:08.810
We'll be drinking with the bloody king.

45:08.880 --> 45:09.881
The Derby?

45:10.960 --> 45:12.769
Did he say the Derby?

45:17.080 --> 45:18.764
That's right.

45:18.840 --> 45:21.650
For the last 10 years,
Sabini's made it his race.

45:21.720 --> 45:24.769
If we're going to take him down, might
as well make it there, as a symbol.

45:24.840 --> 45:26.922
Did you come up with this idea
in a pub by any chance?

45:27.000 --> 45:28.081
Pol.

45:28.160 --> 45:32.722
A good racehorse is an investment,
like property.

45:32.800 --> 45:35.280
We need to diversify the portfolio.

45:36.080 --> 45:37.286
So when is this sale?

45:37.360 --> 45:38.486
Tomorrow.

45:38.560 --> 45:41.803
Tommy's had a death threat, so we'll
have to go with him for protection.

45:41.880 --> 45:45.646
So, you're going to close up
the shop, go out on a piss-up

45:45.720 --> 45:48.451
and blow 1,000 guineas on a horse
that's not even whole Arab.

45:48.520 --> 45:51.171
Quarter-Arab is better!

45:51.920 --> 45:55.208
- Quarter-Arab, it means...
-Curly, shut up.

45:58.600 --> 46:00.762
I thought I told you to lock that door.

46:01.680 --> 46:04.206
He did. I used the key on the nail.

46:04.280 --> 46:06.601
Look, I've been listening.

46:06.680 --> 46:08.842
- I want to go with them.
-You see?

46:10.000 --> 46:12.731
I love horses. I could even help.

46:13.520 --> 46:14.885
Over my dead body!

46:15.040 --> 46:16.804
It'll be all right, Mum.

46:17.720 --> 46:20.610
I've been to loads of horse auctions
before with my uncle.

46:20.680 --> 46:24.810
They're very respectable.
People bring their butlers.

46:24.880 --> 46:27.008
Yeah, and their posh wives!

46:27.080 --> 46:28.366
And their mistresses.

46:29.680 --> 46:31.444
Let him come, Polly.

46:32.320 --> 46:35.324
We'll go there, buy an 'orse, come back.

46:35.400 --> 46:38.882
I'll drop him back at the house
in Sutton before it gets dark.

46:39.920 --> 46:40.921
No.

46:43.400 --> 46:44.686
Fucking no!

47:05.200 --> 47:07.771
All right, that's it. Back to work.

47:07.840 --> 47:09.080
Come on!

47:14.080 --> 47:17.368
Aunt Pol, when I was Michael's age,

47:17.440 --> 47:20.091
I'd killed 100 men and seen 1,000 die.

47:20.920 --> 47:23.127
If you want to scare
that kid away forever,

47:23.200 --> 47:25.441
carry on how you're going.

47:25.520 --> 47:27.522
If you want him to stay,

47:27.600 --> 47:29.045
let him come.

47:41.360 --> 47:42.486
I can't believe it.

47:43.120 --> 47:45.327
All John's old things fit me.

47:46.600 --> 47:49.046
Christ, you look like your father.

48:00.480 --> 48:02.687
Shrimp, ham.

48:09.720 --> 48:11.722
What was he like? My dad?

48:12.920 --> 48:14.445
How did he die?

48:17.160 --> 48:20.289
Well, I won't lie to you.

48:21.480 --> 48:24.689
He died drunk,
squeezed between a boat and a lock.

48:26.040 --> 48:28.122
A real river gypsy's death.

48:30.160 --> 48:32.606
But he could sing,

48:32.680 --> 48:34.330
play the piano...

48:35.280 --> 48:37.681
His smile would break your heart.

48:39.560 --> 48:42.040
You've got his same beautiful eyes.

48:46.560 --> 48:49.370
When he was sober,
he was kind and gentle.

48:55.920 --> 48:57.285
His trouble was,

48:57.360 --> 48:59.442
he fell in with the wrong crowd
when he was a boy.

49:03.840 --> 49:07.686
I have told them not to blow that horn.

49:08.720 --> 49:11.121
This is a respectable
fucking neighbourhood!

49:33.080 --> 49:35.731
- She's heating up, Curly. Take a look.
-Yeah.

49:37.960 --> 49:39.803
Let me out for a piss.

49:42.000 --> 49:43.445
She made loads. Do you want one?

49:43.520 --> 49:44.681
What the bloody hell's that?

49:45.280 --> 49:48.363
Sandwiches. Ham, I think.
And we've got shrimp paste, too.

49:48.880 --> 49:51.884
There's tea, but we'll have to
take turns 'cause there's only one cup.

49:53.640 --> 49:54.641
What?

49:55.200 --> 49:56.281
Sandwiches?

49:57.560 --> 50:00.245
- Yeah.
-Polly made bloody sandwiches?

50:00.320 --> 50:01.924
What's this?
Teddy bear's fucking picnic?

50:02.000 --> 50:05.402
All right. We will drink
the tea and we will eat the sandwiches

50:05.480 --> 50:07.482
and then we will drive on. All right?

50:07.560 --> 50:09.130
No crumbs, Charlie.

50:10.800 --> 50:13.007
- Hand them over.
- Herd them up, Arth, you fat bastard.

50:13.080 --> 50:15.082
- Fuck off.
- John, come on!

50:16.840 --> 50:18.968
All right, lads,
this is a respectable event

50:19.040 --> 50:20.451
and we will all behave accordingly.

50:20.520 --> 50:24.889
No weapons, no drinking.
John, we will stay together.

50:24.960 --> 50:26.564
When the horse comes up,
I will do the bidding.

50:26.640 --> 50:29.450
I've already registered my interest
with the auctioneer.

50:29.520 --> 50:30.806
So he knows to expect my bids.

50:30.880 --> 50:33.087
Do I get to run a hand over her, Tommy?

50:33.160 --> 50:35.766
We'll have a vet's report, Curly.
But keep an eye open when she walks.

50:35.840 --> 50:38.127
I've got a feeling, Tommy.
Something isn't right.

50:38.200 --> 50:41.090
It's all right, Curly. You're just
in an unfamiliar place, we all are.

50:41.160 --> 50:43.640
- I get feelings sometimes, Tommy.
-It's all right, Curly. It's all right.

50:43.720 --> 50:46.564
- Shut up, Curly.
- Do I hear 1,450?

50:46.640 --> 50:48.563
Do I hear 500, 500,

50:48.640 --> 50:52.008
1,600, 1,700? Thank you.

50:52.080 --> 50:54.321
1,900, 2,000,

50:54.400 --> 50:57.131
2,100, 2,200..

50:57.200 --> 50:59.362
Why do people come late to these things?

50:59.440 --> 51:00.521
Hmm?

51:01.520 --> 51:03.284
People come late
'cause they know what they want.

51:03.360 --> 51:05.522
It's only you who needs
to see every horse.

51:05.600 --> 51:07.250
Am I bid?

51:07.320 --> 51:09.322
2,600. I am bid!

51:10.800 --> 51:12.450
Sold!

51:12.520 --> 51:17.606
Morals of Marcus, Sedgemere stud,
by Tetrarch out of Lady Josephine.

51:17.680 --> 51:20.081
We'll start the bidding at 800 guineas.

51:20.160 --> 51:21.730
All right, Tommy, this is her.

51:35.960 --> 51:37.849
Do I hear 800 guineas?

51:38.640 --> 51:39.641
850?

51:41.280 --> 51:44.284
850. Do I hear nine?

51:45.680 --> 51:47.170
Do I hear nine? Nine, am I bid?

51:47.240 --> 51:48.844
Bid for this one.

51:48.920 --> 51:50.410
The grey? Why?

51:51.320 --> 51:53.129
- He's beautiful.
-It's a filly.

51:53.200 --> 51:55.441
Micky needs some pace on the gallops.
I promised him.

51:55.520 --> 51:58.330
1,000. Do I hear 1,050?

51:59.280 --> 52:01.282
1,100?

52:01.880 --> 52:03.689
1,200?

52:04.560 --> 52:06.244
Do I hear 250?

52:07.640 --> 52:08.880
250.

52:08.960 --> 52:11.167
I'll go halves with you
from the spring fund. Go, go.

52:12.320 --> 52:14.527
1,300?

52:14.600 --> 52:16.682
1,400?

52:17.280 --> 52:18.805
Do I hear five?

52:19.240 --> 52:21.004
1,500.

52:21.080 --> 52:22.650
1,600.

52:22.720 --> 52:24.324
Do I hear seven?

52:24.920 --> 52:26.729
1,700. Thank you.

52:26.800 --> 52:28.165
That's it, Tom, you have to stop.

52:28.240 --> 52:29.366
You don't have it in your belt.

52:29.440 --> 52:31.761
Yes, I do. I'm having the horse.

52:31.840 --> 52:34.081
She's a sweet beast, Tom.
But, stop, I tell you.

52:34.160 --> 52:36.128
- I feel something bad!
-Shut up, Curly!

52:36.200 --> 52:39.568
2,000. Do I hear 2,050?

52:41.320 --> 52:43.004
2,050. Am I bid?

52:43.960 --> 52:45.689
-2,050...
-Enough!

52:45.760 --> 52:47.569
Billy could use one of my geldings.

52:47.640 --> 52:50.564
2,000, I am bid. Do I hear 2,050?

52:51.640 --> 52:53.005
Last time.

52:53.240 --> 52:55.447
2,050?

52:56.760 --> 52:59.366
Sold! To Mr...

52:59.440 --> 53:01.329
Thomas Shelby.

53:16.680 --> 53:19.365
To the premises of Mr Charles Strong,

53:19.440 --> 53:20.441
Small Heath.

53:20.520 --> 53:23.126
- What kind of premises?
-Boat yard.

53:23.200 --> 53:24.406
Yachts?

53:25.320 --> 53:26.321
Canals.

53:29.560 --> 53:32.086
I'm curious.
What is your business, Mr Shelby?

53:32.160 --> 53:33.685
Import, export.

53:36.240 --> 53:39.244
But I also sell pegs and tell fortunes.

53:45.560 --> 53:47.244
You beat us to it.

53:47.960 --> 53:48.961
Did I?

53:49.600 --> 53:51.967
I was trying to nab a filly for my stud.

53:53.480 --> 53:56.006
- Sorry.
-Thomas Shelby from where?

53:58.160 --> 53:59.571
From Birmingham.

53:59.640 --> 54:00.641
Goodness!

54:00.720 --> 54:02.165
No, not much.

54:03.240 --> 54:05.925
May Carleton.
I breed racehorses and train them.

54:06.000 --> 54:07.411
What is it you do?

54:08.080 --> 54:10.401
I rarely answer questions, is what I do.

54:10.480 --> 54:13.643
Tommy, come on, hurry up!
We've got to go!

54:15.320 --> 54:17.482
Well, before you go, if you ever
decide to put that filly out,

54:17.560 --> 54:20.211
- I'd be interested in having her.
-I plan to race her.

54:21.320 --> 54:24.403
- Do you have a trainer?
-I know people.

54:24.480 --> 54:25.561
- I know people, too.
-Tommy!

54:25.640 --> 54:27.608
We've got to get
this kid back before dark

54:27.680 --> 54:29.523
or Polly will have your balls!

54:29.600 --> 54:31.090
She will have 'em!

54:31.160 --> 54:33.049
We know different people, I would guess.

54:33.120 --> 54:34.804
My father knows Mick Hancock.

54:35.560 --> 54:39.246
- Trained three Ascot winners.
-Oh, so that was your father?

54:41.320 --> 54:42.685
Yes.

54:42.760 --> 54:45.081
We're joint-owners of the stud.

54:45.160 --> 54:48.130
He took the majority share
when my husband was killed.

54:48.200 --> 54:49.326
Ypres.

54:49.400 --> 54:53.200
Tommy!
We've got to get back to the caravans!

54:53.280 --> 54:54.964
The chickens are hungry!

54:59.080 --> 55:01.048
So will you consider me?

55:02.960 --> 55:04.450
I will consider you.

55:06.400 --> 55:09.006
You still didn't tell me what you do.

55:09.440 --> 55:11.204
Oh! I do bad things.

55:12.400 --> 55:14.448
But you already know that.

55:16.640 --> 55:18.802
Right, about bloody time!

55:23.960 --> 55:25.689
It's the fucking truth, John boy.

55:25.760 --> 55:29.481
Rich women these days,
all they want is working-class cock.

55:30.240 --> 55:33.562
Tommy, maybe she was the
something bad I had the feeling about!

55:33.640 --> 55:35.290
Ah! She looks all right to me, Curly!

55:35.360 --> 55:38.603
All their men are dead, see.
Officers, all shot.

55:38.680 --> 55:39.681
Yeah, by us.

55:39.760 --> 55:42.127
All I'll say is she has good contacts
in the racing world.

55:42.200 --> 55:43.281
Here, Michael, you drive.

55:43.360 --> 55:44.646
Thomas Shelby?

55:44.720 --> 55:46.370
- Tommy!

55:47.800 --> 55:49.290
- Tommy! Down!

55:52.640 --> 55:53.926
Tommy Shelby?

55:54.000 --> 55:55.570
How about fucking Arthur?

55:55.640 --> 55:57.449
Fucking good to meet you.

55:57.520 --> 55:59.045
Get him off him!

55:59.120 --> 56:00.451
Arthur! Arthur!

56:00.520 --> 56:03.285
Get him off him!

56:03.360 --> 56:05.089
Come on. Stop it, Arthur.

56:05.800 --> 56:07.290
Get him off.

56:07.360 --> 56:09.203
Arthur, that's enough.

56:09.280 --> 56:11.408
Arthur, come on!

56:14.880 --> 56:17.281
Come on, Arthur, come on.

56:17.360 --> 56:19.010
That's it. It's over.

56:19.680 --> 56:20.886
Arthur!

56:23.200 --> 56:25.601
Come on, shut up.

56:27.560 --> 56:29.722
Come on, come on.

56:33.920 --> 56:34.921
He's still breathing.

56:35.000 --> 56:37.048
Don't get blood on the kid!

56:37.120 --> 56:40.363
Michael, you didn't see a thing.
This didn't happen, all right?

56:40.440 --> 56:42.363
Give me the keys.

56:42.440 --> 56:44.010
Michael, give me the keys.

56:44.080 --> 56:46.003
I'm all right to drive.

56:48.200 --> 56:49.770
All right. Go on. Go on, go on!

56:49.840 --> 56:51.808
Tommy, he's fucking scarpered!

56:51.880 --> 56:54.850
- Right, let's get out of here, sharpish.
-Come on!

57:09.000 --> 57:10.684
So?

57:11.680 --> 57:13.091
How'd it go?

57:13.680 --> 57:15.444
Well, it was cold in the van,

57:15.520 --> 57:17.522
but it was super. Really.

57:18.200 --> 57:19.929
Let me smell your breath.

57:23.200 --> 57:24.884
Did they behave themselves?

57:27.120 --> 57:29.043
They were amazing, Mum.

57:29.840 --> 57:31.842
They were really amazing.

58:23.160 --> 58:33.166
