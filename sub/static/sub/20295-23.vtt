00:14.667 --> 00:16.867

00:16.900 --> 00:18.133
-Officer: You better stop!

00:21.000 --> 00:22.267

-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.400 --> 00:36.467
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.500 --> 00:39.033
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:39.067 --> 00:42.267
in a court of law.

00:42.300 --> 00:43.733
-I like to think
that we're fair.

00:43.767 --> 00:45.267
If you're out committing crimes,

00:45.300 --> 00:46.867
we're gonna run you
to the ground.

00:46.900 --> 00:48.933
But once it's over,

00:48.967 --> 00:50.033
I don't try to make 'em
feel bad

00:50.067 --> 00:51.367
about where they're
at in life.

00:51.400 --> 00:53.433
We get along with 'em just fine.
We try as much as we can,

00:53.467 --> 00:55.000
encourage them
to change their ways.

00:55.033 --> 00:56.567
I mean, I'm still gonna book 'em
in jail,

00:56.600 --> 01:00.467
but there's nothing that says
we can't be friendly.

01:00.500 --> 01:03.667
-We just got a hit on this
four-door Honda in front of us.

01:03.700 --> 01:05.567
It might possibly be stolen.

01:05.600 --> 01:06.900
-Ace two, we're
northbound Walerga

01:06.933 --> 01:08.200
and turning eastbound Penwith.

01:08.233 --> 01:10.800
(radio chatter)

01:12.267 --> 01:13.933
-Dispatcher:
Southbound Whitecliff.

01:18.300 --> 01:19.967
-Turn it off!

01:20.067 --> 01:21.267
Shut it off!

01:22.267 --> 01:23.667
Turn the car off!

01:26.167 --> 01:28.300
Turn the car off!

01:28.333 --> 01:31.400
-Ace two,
we're committed. 6337.

01:31.433 --> 01:33.567
-Turn it off!

01:33.600 --> 01:35.333
Put the keys outside!

01:35.367 --> 01:38.800
-Dispatcher:
Copy, 6337 Whitecliff.

01:38.833 --> 01:41.067
-Turn the car off!
-Dude, he's not--

01:41.100 --> 01:42.700
(tires squeal)

01:44.067 --> 01:45.500
(siren blares)

01:45.533 --> 01:48.733
Ace two, we're in pursuit.
Southbound Whitecliff.

01:51.800 --> 01:55.467
Passing Kirkby,
speeds are 55.

01:57.500 --> 01:58.900
Get ready, he's gonna bail.
-Yup, yup.

02:01.733 --> 02:04.333
-And on the frontage road.

02:04.367 --> 02:06.667
-Don't slow down,
don't slow down, you're good.

02:06.700 --> 02:08.367
-He's losing control.

02:08.400 --> 02:12.333
We're on the frontage road
back northbound towards
Kirkby and Walerga.

02:17.567 --> 02:19.067
-Dispatcher: Copy that.
-Clear.

02:21.067 --> 02:23.667
-Blew the stop.
Northbound Walerga.

02:34.567 --> 02:37.233
And he's going up on the curb.

02:37.267 --> 02:38.367
-He's trapped!

02:38.400 --> 02:39.733
Go, go, go!

02:39.767 --> 02:41.533
-Freeze!

02:41.567 --> 02:42.967
(officers shouting indistinctly)

02:47.867 --> 02:49.233
-Get down!

02:50.233 --> 02:51.733
-Get him, get him, get him!

03:01.700 --> 03:03.100
-Come on, man!

03:03.133 --> 03:04.533
-(yelling)

03:04.567 --> 03:05.900
I'm sorry!

03:05.933 --> 03:07.733
-Hands behind your back!

03:07.767 --> 03:09.467
-No, come on, man!

03:09.500 --> 03:10.633
-Ace two, fighting.

03:10.667 --> 03:11.833
-No!

03:11.867 --> 03:13.067
I'm sorry!
-Hands behind your back!

03:13.100 --> 03:15.167
Put your hands
behind your back!

03:15.200 --> 03:16.400
-Okay!

03:16.433 --> 03:18.600
-Meggs, you got this one?
-Yeah.

03:18.633 --> 03:19.833
-(bleep)

03:20.833 --> 03:22.067
Oh, man.

03:22.067 --> 03:23.367
-You good?

03:25.500 --> 03:27.300
-I pulled my hamstring
so bad, dude.

03:27.333 --> 03:29.067
-Okay.
-Oh, my God.

03:29.067 --> 03:31.100
-I got him.
-I'm sorry, man.

03:35.067 --> 03:36.967
-Can I stuff him in yours?
-What's that?

03:37.067 --> 03:38.533
-Yeah, Meggs pulled
his hamstring.

03:38.567 --> 03:39.933
-Okay.
-Please don't forget my stuff.

03:39.967 --> 03:41.067
-I'm not gonna forget
your stuff.

03:41.067 --> 03:42.333
You got him?
-Yup.

03:42.367 --> 03:44.867
-Can you get-- just fire
precautionary for both of 'em.

03:54.267 --> 03:55.533
-Shaved keys.

03:55.567 --> 03:57.600
He kept carrying a Rolex
in his hands.

03:57.633 --> 04:00.333
It says Rolex.
You tell me if that's real.

04:00.367 --> 04:02.833
And there's a house key
in the ignition.

04:04.733 --> 04:06.367
-It doesn't look real because

04:06.400 --> 04:09.467
the Rolex second hand
should go continuously.

04:09.500 --> 04:11.800
-Not herky-jerky.
-It shouldn't go ts-ts-ts-ts.

04:11.833 --> 04:13.867
So it's probably
not gonna be real.

04:13.900 --> 04:15.667
-Gotcha.

04:16.800 --> 04:19.733
-First of all, how are--
Is your face all right?

04:19.767 --> 04:22.100
I got fire coming.
They'll take a look at
your cut or something.

04:22.133 --> 04:23.300
-Yeah.

04:23.333 --> 04:24.733
-You okay otherwise?

04:26.067 --> 04:28.867
-I'm dehydrated.

04:28.900 --> 04:31.333
-Okay. How about we get you
some water here in a second.

04:31.367 --> 04:32.433
-That'd be awesome.

04:32.467 --> 04:33.800
-Do you live close by
here or what?

04:33.833 --> 04:35.533
Can I send her to go get
something to drink for you?

04:36.900 --> 04:38.833
Hey, can you go get him, like,
a drink of water or something?

04:38.867 --> 04:40.367
Yeah, thank you.
Bottle of water or something.

04:40.400 --> 04:41.700
Thank you.

04:41.733 --> 04:43.067
So who's this girl
you have over here?

04:43.067 --> 04:44.367
-She's a friend.

04:44.400 --> 04:45.400
-She's a friend?

04:46.567 --> 04:48.300
-Not a Honda key.

04:48.333 --> 04:51.100
It's just a house key
jammed in there and turned.

04:51.133 --> 04:52.900
Defeats the ignition
on these older cars.

04:52.933 --> 04:54.933
It just cracks it
and basically breaks it

04:54.967 --> 04:56.467
and allows it to turn.

04:56.500 --> 04:57.967
-Did you steal
that car, or no?

04:59.067 --> 05:00.533
-I didn't steal it, no.
-Okay.

05:00.567 --> 05:02.233
Did you know it was stolen?

05:02.267 --> 05:04.767
-When you guys got behind me
I figured.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.200
-Okay.

05:09.300 --> 05:10.433
Here you go.

05:13.067 --> 05:15.067
I'm sure you didn't want
your day to end like this.

05:15.100 --> 05:16.700
You know what I'm saying?

05:16.733 --> 05:19.133
You drove a little crazy,
don't you think?

05:19.167 --> 05:20.567
Dang, dude.

05:20.600 --> 05:21.833
I'm too old
to be chasing you.

05:21.867 --> 05:24.433
You know, I jacked up
my hamstring chasing you, dude.

05:24.467 --> 05:25.733
-And I almost got away.

05:25.767 --> 05:27.300
-You almost got away.
Here's the deal, dude.

05:27.333 --> 05:29.367
-I'm just playing.
-Hey, listen to me,
on a good day, though--

05:29.400 --> 05:33.100
Look at me. On a good day
though, I don't know.

05:33.133 --> 05:34.800
-Yeah.
-What have you been arrested
for in the past?

05:34.833 --> 05:37.367
-Possession of stolen property.

05:37.400 --> 05:39.333
-I mean, you had to have an idea
the car was stolen.

05:39.367 --> 05:41.800
You don't have a key for it.
What's the deal? What was
the deal on the car?

05:43.300 --> 05:45.300
-'Cause the guy I got it from,
I don't know.

05:45.333 --> 05:46.767
It was kinda sketchy...
-Okay.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.433
-...but it was cheap,
so I got it.

05:48.467 --> 05:49.467
-What's that?

05:49.500 --> 05:50.967
-So it was cheap
so I bought it.

05:51.067 --> 05:52.100
-Cheap. Okay.

05:52.133 --> 05:53.633
-On Craigslist.
-Craigslist?

05:53.667 --> 05:54.967
How much
did you pay for it?

05:55.067 --> 05:57.933
-Like 450.
-400?

05:57.967 --> 06:00.167
So, he's got-- He's bleeding
a little bit right there.
-All right.

06:00.200 --> 06:02.067
-That's it.
-Do you guys want him
to go by ambulance or...

06:02.100 --> 06:03.767
-I don't want him
to go anywhere.
-Okay.

06:03.800 --> 06:06.567
-I just wanted to make sure that
he was just cleaned up
his little scrapey-poo.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.633
-All right.
-Maybe a Snoopy
band-aid or something.

06:09.667 --> 06:11.567
All right. We got fire
looking at you right now.

06:12.900 --> 06:14.667
You hurt anywhere else
but your face, or no?

06:14.700 --> 06:16.167
You all good?

06:16.200 --> 06:17.333
All right. Here.

06:17.367 --> 06:18.900
These guys are gonna
take a look at you, okay?

06:18.933 --> 06:20.067
-Hey, what's your name?

06:20.067 --> 06:21.533
-Brandon.
-Brandon. How old
are you, Brandon?

06:21.567 --> 06:22.567
-23.

06:22.600 --> 06:24.100
-Okay. You know
what city you're in?

06:24.133 --> 06:25.800
-Sacramento.

06:25.833 --> 06:27.233
-You need to get him
on the right track.

06:27.267 --> 06:28.567
-Oh, I know.
-Okay?

06:28.600 --> 06:30.067
He don't seem like
a bad kid to me.

06:30.100 --> 06:31.900
After everything was said
and done, he was really cool.

06:31.933 --> 06:33.067
-Yeah, he's...
-And you know what?

06:33.067 --> 06:35.067
He needs to be spending
more time with you.

06:35.067 --> 06:37.667
He needs to buy one of those
cars for $1500

06:37.700 --> 06:40.300
instead of, you know,
driving a stolen.
-I know.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.067
-And take you out to coffee
or dinner or something.

06:42.067 --> 06:43.467
-That's what he
should be doing.

06:43.500 --> 06:45.800
Get out of this area,
get out of that routine, okay?

06:45.833 --> 06:47.833
I really appreciate
your help today.
Thank you so much.

06:47.867 --> 06:49.467
-I appreciate you guys, too.
Thank you very much.

06:49.500 --> 06:50.867
Yeah, see you later.
-All right.

06:50.900 --> 06:52.267
-He'll go to jail
for auto theft,

06:52.300 --> 06:55.567
possession of a stolen vehicle,
and then for the pursuit.

06:55.600 --> 06:57.900
-He already said he--
He already apologized.

06:57.933 --> 07:00.200
Made a statement to
the citizens and everything.

07:00.233 --> 07:01.367
-Okay.
-You know.

07:01.400 --> 07:02.700
He's glad he didn't
hurt anybody though.

07:02.733 --> 07:05.433
-Apology accepted.
Let's just not do it again.

07:08.067 --> 07:11.733
-I'm going to Las Vegas
to compete in
the Vintage Strength Games.

07:11.767 --> 07:15.133
You know, I've always
been attracted to
unconventional things.

07:15.167 --> 07:17.167
And this is some
unconventional training.

07:17.200 --> 07:19.233
You don't need a gym, you don't
need the machines,

07:19.267 --> 07:21.100
you just need yourself
and a little bit of willpower.

07:21.133 --> 07:23.067
So I thought I'd test myself

07:23.067 --> 07:25.467
and see if this old man could
make it happen.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.067
(radio chatter)

07:27.067 --> 07:29.733
We're going to back up another
officer at a bar fight.

07:29.767 --> 07:32.467
An afternoon bar fight.
Supposedly with a hammer.

07:32.500 --> 07:35.967
He's there right there.
He beat us to it.

07:43.067 --> 07:44.200
What's happening?

07:44.233 --> 07:46.467
-My dad said that my husband
just went over there

07:46.500 --> 07:49.267
and slashed his tires
and beat up his truck.

07:49.300 --> 07:50.733
-Who did?
-My husband.

07:50.767 --> 07:53.067
-Your husband did that
to your dad?

07:54.400 --> 07:56.233
-Your-- I'm confused.

07:56.267 --> 07:57.800
Your husband did that
to your dad's truck.

07:57.833 --> 07:59.200
-Yeah.
-Okay. So then what happened?

07:59.233 --> 08:00.300
You came over here?
-Mm-hmm.

08:00.333 --> 08:01.533
-And what happened here?

08:01.567 --> 08:02.567
-Nothing.
-Okay,

08:02.600 --> 08:03.867
why did we get--
-I was screaming.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.667
-Why'd we get called here
about somebody having a hammer

08:05.700 --> 08:07.133
and fighting and all
that kind of stuff?

08:07.167 --> 08:08.300
-'Cause I was screaming.

08:08.333 --> 08:09.933
-Oh, okay, well,
someone said that--

08:09.967 --> 08:13.067
Someone said that
you guys were fighting
with a hammer back here.

08:13.067 --> 08:14.500
-No, we don't have a hammer.

08:14.533 --> 08:16.633
-Is that your husband
in the tank top there?

08:16.667 --> 08:18.233
With the tattoos?

08:18.267 --> 08:20.400
Why would he go over to your
dad's place and do that?

08:20.433 --> 08:21.433
-'Cause we're fighting.

08:21.467 --> 08:22.500
-Where is your dad right now?

08:22.533 --> 08:23.567
-Uh, down the street.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.067
-So he's never called in
to report this.

08:25.067 --> 08:26.433
-He told me he did.

08:26.467 --> 08:27.600
-Well, he hasn't.

08:27.633 --> 08:29.300
They have no record of any
police officer ever--

08:29.333 --> 08:31.067
-Can I call him?
-Please, go right ahead.

08:31.067 --> 08:32.333
You wait right here for me.

08:32.367 --> 08:33.700
I'm gonna go deal
with something else.

08:33.733 --> 08:34.900
-Okay.

08:34.933 --> 08:36.567
-So, what's going on?

08:36.600 --> 08:37.867
-We had a little argument.

08:37.900 --> 08:39.867
They watched us at the door
the whole entire time.

08:39.900 --> 08:41.500
No hands got put
on anybody.

08:41.533 --> 08:42.767
Little argument, that was it.

08:42.800 --> 08:44.567
Then you guys rolled up.
-What was the argument about?

08:44.600 --> 08:46.200
-The argument was about
she's my wife--

08:46.233 --> 08:47.933
-Uh-huh.
-Uh...

08:47.967 --> 08:51.067
Somebody called
her phone yesterday--

08:51.067 --> 08:52.333
yesterday night--

08:52.367 --> 08:53.967
I answered it,
it was another guy,

08:54.067 --> 08:55.333
I got pissed off.
-Okay.

08:55.367 --> 08:57.067
-And yeah. That's where it's at.

08:57.067 --> 08:59.233
-All right. Where else have you
been today?
-And she's been just--

08:59.267 --> 09:00.700
Where else have I been?
-Yeah.

09:00.733 --> 09:01.733
-What do you mean?

09:01.767 --> 09:03.067
-Did you go
anywhere else today?

09:03.067 --> 09:04.600
'Cause any other mayhem
anywhere else?

09:04.633 --> 09:05.967
-No! (bleep).

09:06.067 --> 09:07.167
-I'm just-- I'm asking,
I'm curious.

09:07.200 --> 09:08.500
-No, no.
-Where have you been today?

09:08.533 --> 09:10.200
-The car wash. That's where
I just came from.
-Okay.

09:10.233 --> 09:11.433
You know what,
gimme one second.

09:11.467 --> 09:13.067
Let me just hang on
to this for a minute.

09:13.067 --> 09:14.433
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

09:14.467 --> 09:17.067
-So nobody gets hurt or anything
weird like that happens.

09:17.067 --> 09:18.633
Where does her dad live?

09:18.667 --> 09:19.833
Were you over there
at all today?

09:19.867 --> 09:21.167
Did something
happen over there?

09:21.200 --> 09:22.533
-No. My grandma called me

09:22.567 --> 09:25.833
and said that somebody went over
there and bashed his car in.

09:25.867 --> 09:27.833
-And that--
-Okay. How would your
grandma know that?

09:27.867 --> 09:31.067
-Probably because my grandma
lives in the same town that I do
in Baxter.

09:31.067 --> 09:32.933
-All right. Hang out here
for a second.

09:32.967 --> 09:36.500
-Sarah, time to be
very honest with me.

09:36.533 --> 09:38.067
Was there a hammer
involved, Sarah?

09:38.067 --> 09:39.400
-Yes.
-Okay.

09:39.433 --> 09:41.667
Every single person in this bar
says you were swinging a hammer.

09:41.700 --> 09:44.433
-I wasn't swinging it.
I had it behind my back.
That was it.

09:44.467 --> 09:45.967
-Number two, where is it now?

09:46.067 --> 09:47.633
-In the blue truck.

09:47.667 --> 09:49.400
-Okay. How did it end up
in the blue truck?

09:49.433 --> 09:51.567
-I put it in the seat
after they came outside

09:51.600 --> 09:52.800
saying that I had a hammer.

09:52.833 --> 09:54.300
-Okay.
-And that they was
calling the cops.

09:54.333 --> 09:56.733
-Why'd you have
the hammer with you?

09:56.767 --> 09:59.767
-Because he went
and busted, I wanted to go
bust his windows out, too.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.000
His Monte Carlo, to be
absolutely honest with you.

10:02.033 --> 10:05.767
-Okay.
-To his '86 Monte Carlo
that he loves.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.000
-A little revenge.

10:07.033 --> 10:08.633
I imagine he does
love that car.
-So, I wanted to--

10:08.667 --> 10:09.933
-Is this your dad?
-Yes.

10:09.967 --> 10:11.767
-What happened today?
You gotta tell me what happened.

10:11.800 --> 10:13.000
I'm trying to figure this out.

10:13.033 --> 10:14.733
-They was fighting, he came
through, slashed my tires.

10:14.767 --> 10:16.767
-Did you see him do that?
-Well, I didn't actually
see him.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.733
He hollered in
the window afterwards.
-What did he holler?

10:18.767 --> 10:20.033
-And then he--
Just, "Jimmy, Jimmy!"

10:20.067 --> 10:21.267
Called my name
some times.

10:21.300 --> 10:23.167
-So, he yelled
"Jimmy, Jimmy"

10:23.200 --> 10:24.867
and then your tires
were slashed.
-Yeah.

10:24.900 --> 10:26.033
-Did you call the police?

10:26.067 --> 10:27.733
-No. I told them I did,
and I was going to,

10:27.767 --> 10:29.000
but I wasn't gonna
involve the police

10:29.033 --> 10:30.933
if they were just fighting
and making up.

10:30.967 --> 10:32.100
I mean...
-Okay.

10:32.133 --> 10:33.600
I can understand that.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.600
You don't want to jam everybody
up 'cause of that.
-Yeah.

10:35.633 --> 10:38.467
Yeah, he's on pre-trial
release and that.

10:38.500 --> 10:40.200
Don't want problems.
-Oh, he is?

10:40.233 --> 10:41.733
-Yeah. Wasn't trying
to 'cause problems.
-Okay.

10:41.767 --> 10:43.133
Let's talk to him
about that for a second.

10:43.167 --> 10:44.300
-No, can we--

10:44.333 --> 10:45.867
Come on, Dad!

10:45.900 --> 10:47.000
-Hi, what's up?

10:47.033 --> 10:48.333
-You're under arrest
for criminal mischief.

10:48.367 --> 10:49.633
You drove that car
up here today?

10:49.667 --> 10:51.033
-Yeah, my grandma's on
her way to get it.

10:51.067 --> 10:53.267
-Okay. Well, we need
to search it because
you were arrested.

10:53.300 --> 10:54.900
-Why do you need to search it?

10:54.933 --> 10:57.167
-Because you were the one
who drove it up here.
-You can't search my car.

10:57.200 --> 10:58.800
-Yes, we can.
You were arrested.
-No, you can't.

10:58.833 --> 11:00.167
I didn't drive it
up here at all.

11:00.200 --> 11:01.533
-How did it get here?

11:01.567 --> 11:03.200
-How-- It was already here.

11:03.233 --> 11:04.367
-Who brought it up here?

11:04.400 --> 11:05.600
-How do I know?

11:05.633 --> 11:07.100
-You don't know who
brought your own car up here?

11:07.133 --> 11:08.333
-It's not my car.

11:08.367 --> 11:09.600
-The blue Mountaineer?

11:09.633 --> 11:11.200
-Yeah.
-The one you just told me
you drove into town.

11:11.233 --> 11:12.933
-It's not my car.
It's my grandmother's car.

11:12.967 --> 11:15.100
I just told you. She's coming
into town to get it.

11:15.133 --> 11:17.067
She has my car she's bringing.

11:17.100 --> 11:19.200
-Okay. Very good.
Be right back.

11:19.233 --> 11:21.133
Have a seat right there
for me, young lady.

11:21.167 --> 11:23.067
You came up here
with a weapon in your hand

11:23.067 --> 11:24.667
and you made
threats to hit him.

11:24.700 --> 11:26.533
It's a domestic.
Gotta be under arrest.

11:26.567 --> 11:28.933
-Man, I'm never being honest
with you guys anymore.

11:28.967 --> 11:30.600
-Swing your legs in for me.

11:30.633 --> 11:32.767
-So it's okay for (bleep)--
-We'll be back to talk
to you in a minute.

11:32.800 --> 11:34.800
-I'm gonna go talk to him next.
-For him to do this
to my dad?

11:34.833 --> 11:38.367
And for him to (bleep) beat me?
-What you did constitutes
a mandatory arrest.

11:38.400 --> 11:39.733
I do not have a choice.

11:39.767 --> 11:41.633
I will let your dad stay right
here and chat with you, okay?

11:41.667 --> 11:42.967
You want to talk
to her for a minute?

11:43.067 --> 11:44.867
-Yeah.
-Okay. Be right back.

11:44.900 --> 11:46.867
Grandma's got sweet rims.

11:46.900 --> 11:49.867
This gentleman's on pre-trial
release for a drug arrest,

11:49.900 --> 11:52.567
which makes me believe that
there's probably drugs
somewhere in this car

11:52.600 --> 11:54.633
that he brought up here
as well, too.

11:54.667 --> 11:56.533
Oh, drugs.

11:56.567 --> 12:00.933
Pretty big thing of weed,
some pills, pipes.

12:00.967 --> 12:02.700
Uh, we're gonna
amend that charge.

12:02.733 --> 12:05.300
He's gonna go
on these dope charges for sure.

12:05.333 --> 12:07.400
And there's also
the marijuana wax.

12:07.433 --> 12:09.333
All-righty. Whose drugs
are in that car?

12:09.367 --> 12:10.433
-I have no idea.

12:10.467 --> 12:11.700
-You don't know what it is?
-No.

12:11.733 --> 12:12.967
-Okay. We're gonna test it.

12:13.067 --> 12:14.867
-My sister drives the car
more than anybody.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.700
My grandma will
be here, you can--

12:16.733 --> 12:19.900
Okay, mister, here's a time
that you need to take a little
responsibility for you.

12:19.933 --> 12:21.733
-I'm telling you--
-You're putting it
on your grandma?

12:21.767 --> 12:23.800
This is your grandma's drugs
in that car.
-No, why would I lie?

12:23.833 --> 12:25.333
-Then whose drugs
are in that car?

12:25.367 --> 12:29.433
-I just told you. My sister
drives the car more than
anybody ever.

12:29.467 --> 12:31.600
-Okay.
-Even more than my grandma.

12:31.633 --> 12:33.633
-I have my own vehicle
and everything.
-Right.

12:33.667 --> 12:35.933
That's what I appreciate.
Thanks.

12:35.967 --> 12:38.467
So, this is hers.

12:38.500 --> 12:41.067
Please don't be
drugs in this car, too.

12:41.067 --> 12:44.067
Oh, my goodness,
there's drugs in this car.

12:44.100 --> 12:49.600
Oh... Meth pipe.
Paraphernalia. Weed grinder.

12:49.633 --> 12:52.633
She ended up having drug
paraphernalia and pills in here.

12:52.667 --> 12:55.267
So this entire thing just
really went downhill.

12:56.900 --> 13:00.300
Sarah, this entire thing today
stemmed out of what?

13:00.333 --> 13:02.633
Drugs. There's meth pipes
in both vehicles, there's--

13:02.667 --> 13:04.967
-There should not--
Can I say one thing?

13:05.067 --> 13:07.233
-Okay, there should not be,
but there is, okay?
-I'm telling you--

13:07.267 --> 13:09.967
-And then there's methamphe--
There's a big bag of
methamphetamine.

13:10.067 --> 13:12.100
There's marijuana
packaged for sale,

13:12.133 --> 13:16.067
and there's also the marijuana
wax, which is new with
the kids right now, okay?

13:16.067 --> 13:17.500
Let's be honest,
it's full of drugs.

13:17.533 --> 13:18.667
You understand
what I'm saying?

13:18.700 --> 13:20.600
That's all what we found
in there today.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.667
-I think what
you two need to do--
-In my car?

13:22.700 --> 13:23.800
-Both cars.

13:23.833 --> 13:25.867
So he's gonna take at least
four drug charges

13:25.900 --> 13:28.567
and the charge of drug
paraphernalia for you.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.800
I want you to get
past this and move on.

13:30.833 --> 13:32.267
All right, Sarah.
Good luck to you.

13:34.833 --> 13:37.100
-Being a police officer
in Stockton,

13:37.133 --> 13:39.633
it's a very busy town
to work in.

13:39.667 --> 13:42.433
Sometimes the hours
can be really long

13:42.467 --> 13:44.400
depending on what you got
going on that day.

13:44.433 --> 13:46.500
So when I'm on
my off time

13:46.533 --> 13:49.433
I like to spend time
on the boat.

13:49.467 --> 13:51.133
And enjoy the good weather,

13:51.167 --> 13:53.200
and hang out with family
and friends.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.767
He's got a brake light out.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.667
So I'm gonna stop him
and see who's in it

13:57.700 --> 14:03.133
as this matches the description
of a vehicle that was used
in a shooting.

14:03.167 --> 14:05.167
See who's driving.

14:11.300 --> 14:12.500
How you doing, man?
-All right.

14:12.533 --> 14:14.167
-This your car?
-Yeah. It's my mom's, actually.

14:14.200 --> 14:15.600
-It's your mom's car? Okay.
-Yeah.

14:15.633 --> 14:19.067
-Your brake light up here up on
the top deck lid is not working.

14:19.067 --> 14:20.533
-My brake light?
-You got your license
on you?

14:20.567 --> 14:22.067
-Uh, no, I don't, actually.

14:22.067 --> 14:23.900
-Do you have a license?
-Yes, sir. Yeah.

14:23.933 --> 14:25.733
-You should. Do you have
any I.D. on you at all?

14:25.767 --> 14:27.233
-No, I don't sir. NO.
-No, I.D. at all?

14:27.267 --> 14:29.067
-You know what, my I.D.
might be expired.

14:29.100 --> 14:30.267
-Okay. All right.

14:30.300 --> 14:31.767
Anybody on probation
or parole or anything?

14:31.800 --> 14:33.200
-Uh, probation.
-For what?

14:33.233 --> 14:36.167
-Uh, just...

14:36.200 --> 14:37.600
-Are you searchable?

14:37.633 --> 14:38.800
-Uh, I don't know.

14:38.833 --> 14:40.667
-What are you on
probation for?

14:40.700 --> 14:42.067
-(bleep)

14:42.100 --> 14:43.600
Possession.
-Possession...

14:43.633 --> 14:45.133
of narcotics?
-Yeah.

14:45.167 --> 14:47.133
-Okay. Undo your belt.

14:47.167 --> 14:49.367
I'm gonna have you
leave the keys in that
cup-holder there.

14:49.400 --> 14:51.500
And then step out and face
away from me, okay?

14:51.533 --> 14:53.367
-Okay.

14:53.400 --> 14:54.800
-Face away from me.
-Oh.

14:54.833 --> 14:56.767
-Interlace your hands
behind your head.

14:56.800 --> 14:58.667
Step back a little bit.
-Yes, sir.

14:58.700 --> 14:59.900
-Spread your feet.

15:00.067 --> 15:01.800
Go ahead and bring your
hands down, man.

15:07.433 --> 15:09.067
I'll have you have
a seat over here.

15:10.067 --> 15:11.067
-Right here?

15:11.100 --> 15:12.833
-Yeah, just have a seat
right here, man.

15:12.867 --> 15:15.133
Do me a favor and put
your feet straight out.
-Okay.

15:15.167 --> 15:16.667
-And cross your feet up.

15:20.533 --> 15:22.400
You on probation
or parole or anything?
-Nope.

15:22.433 --> 15:24.633
-Have a seat over here.

15:24.667 --> 15:26.633
So when they told you
you were gonna be on probation,

15:26.667 --> 15:28.167
they didn't tell you
your conditions at all?

15:28.200 --> 15:29.200
-No, nothing.

15:29.233 --> 15:30.733
-They just said nothing?

15:30.767 --> 15:32.167
They said,
"Hey, you're on probation,

15:32.200 --> 15:34.233
"I'm gonna tell you nothing"?
-Check in. That's all they said.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.433
-So they didn't tell you
your search clauses,
anything like that?

15:36.467 --> 15:38.633
Because they have to, by law.

15:38.667 --> 15:40.067
Where you living at right now?

15:40.100 --> 15:41.500
-I'm homeless.

15:41.533 --> 15:43.267
-You have no address?
-Pretty much.

15:43.300 --> 15:45.767
-Is that what you tell them
at probation?

15:45.800 --> 15:46.800
-Yeah.

15:46.833 --> 15:48.133
-Does probation
know you're homeless?

15:48.167 --> 15:49.200
-Yeah.
-Okay.

15:49.233 --> 15:50.333
-You've told them.
-Yeah.

15:50.367 --> 15:51.567
-I'm on probation, though, sir.

15:51.600 --> 15:52.933
When you asked me,
I told you yes.

15:52.967 --> 15:54.267
-No, yeah.

15:54.300 --> 15:57.667
You just don't know
anything about it, so...

15:57.700 --> 15:59.233
How often do
you drive this car?

15:59.267 --> 16:00.900
-I just bought it.
When I go to work.

16:00.933 --> 16:03.467
-So it's safe to say you
drive this car pretty often?

16:03.500 --> 16:05.700
Nothing illegal in the car?
-No.

16:05.733 --> 16:07.367
-What's happening?

16:07.400 --> 16:11.633
Just keep your eye on them.
I gotta do a search of the car.

16:11.667 --> 16:14.600
He is on full
searchable probation,

16:14.633 --> 16:16.900
so we're gonna do
a search of the car.

16:16.933 --> 16:18.367
Torch.

16:21.500 --> 16:22.967
-For dabs, huh?

16:23.067 --> 16:24.333
-Lot of cookies.

16:25.667 --> 16:27.600
That looks like a knife.

16:27.633 --> 16:30.267
I'll see if it's double-sided
here in a sec.

16:32.067 --> 16:33.267
What?

16:35.300 --> 16:36.833
Hey, just FYI,

16:36.867 --> 16:39.167
the driver, he's on
full searchable probation

16:39.200 --> 16:41.200
for a narcotics violation.

16:44.133 --> 16:46.500
Probably coming over here
to buy, I would imagine

16:46.533 --> 16:48.167
because there's
nothing in here.

16:48.200 --> 16:49.633
All these female clothes.

16:49.667 --> 16:51.433
-It's my mom's stuff.
I told you it's my mom's car.

16:51.467 --> 16:52.700
-Huh?
-It's my mom's car.

16:52.733 --> 16:54.300
I just use it to go to work.
-Yeah?

16:54.333 --> 16:55.867
-Can you call my mom?

17:01.567 --> 17:03.267
-Oh, what's this?

17:03.300 --> 17:07.133
Lot of times these guys will
hide weapons and narcotics
in the hoods

17:07.167 --> 17:08.867
because they think
we won't check.

17:08.900 --> 17:10.600
Doubt it.

17:15.100 --> 17:18.167
Whoa. Holy moly.

17:22.833 --> 17:24.267
Dude...

17:30.300 --> 17:31.367
-Oh.

17:32.533 --> 17:33.667
-Wearing handcuffs?

17:33.700 --> 17:34.700
-Yeah.

17:34.733 --> 17:37.333
Two very large bags of crystal.

17:41.467 --> 17:43.900
This is some
unbroken stuff here.

17:47.267 --> 17:48.833
Another large bag.

17:48.867 --> 17:50.533
-Carrying one for his passenger?

17:50.567 --> 17:51.633
-Yeah.

17:53.100 --> 17:57.400
So... Oh, there's
still some more in here.

17:57.433 --> 17:59.633
Couple smaller bags.

17:59.667 --> 18:01.633
I think my driver's got

18:01.667 --> 18:04.500
a large quantity of cash
on him, too, I believe.

18:04.533 --> 18:07.100
-Okay.
-So...

18:07.133 --> 18:09.300
Probably end up doing
a sales case on this guy

18:09.333 --> 18:11.067
for this amount.

18:12.433 --> 18:15.800
We have to test the stuff
and make sure that
it's crystal meth.

18:18.700 --> 18:21.067
Hey. So that's your
mom's car, right?

18:21.067 --> 18:22.100
-Yeah.
-Okay.

18:22.133 --> 18:25.200
So, hey, does your mom
use crystal meth?

18:25.233 --> 18:26.233
Huh?

18:26.267 --> 18:27.733
-I'm not gonna say nothing.

18:27.767 --> 18:29.200
-What's that?
-I'm not gonna say nothing.

18:29.233 --> 18:31.067
-You're not saying nothing?
Okay.

18:31.100 --> 18:33.300
So the crystal meth belongs
to you, then, right?

18:33.333 --> 18:34.933
No? What about the money?

18:34.967 --> 18:36.233
The money belongs to you?

18:36.267 --> 18:37.867
-What?
-Okay, where did you
get the money?

18:37.900 --> 18:39.700
-I work.
I told you, construction.

18:39.733 --> 18:40.867
-You just work for cash?

18:40.900 --> 18:42.300
-Yeah.
-Okay.

18:42.333 --> 18:44.067
-So you don't know anything
about that crystal meth

18:44.067 --> 18:45.567
that was found underneath
the hood, right?

18:45.600 --> 18:46.767
-I want to exercise
my rights.

18:46.800 --> 18:48.433
-You're gonna exercise
your rights. All right.

18:48.467 --> 18:52.067
Well, obviously I found
a bunch of crystal meth
underneath the hood

18:52.100 --> 18:54.133
in that McDonald's bag.

18:54.167 --> 18:56.067
So you're gonna get
charged with it, okay?

18:56.067 --> 18:58.700
You're gonna get charged with
possession for sales,

18:58.733 --> 19:02.233
and I'm gonna
seize your money. Okay?

19:02.267 --> 19:03.667
-Why you seizing my money?

19:03.700 --> 19:05.700
-Because I'm gonna do
a sales case on you.

19:07.400 --> 19:10.100
There's a large quantity
of crystal meth found
underneath that hood.

19:10.133 --> 19:11.900
You got a bunch of ones,
bunch of fives,

19:11.933 --> 19:13.600
a bunch of tens, twenties.

19:13.633 --> 19:15.200
It's pretty consistent
with sales.

19:15.233 --> 19:16.700
I'm gonna tow
the car as well.

19:21.400 --> 19:24.133
I'm gonna use one of our
test kits to test

19:24.167 --> 19:27.433
and make sure that this
is actually crystal meth.

19:27.467 --> 19:30.300
If it is, it'll turn blue.

19:30.333 --> 19:32.633
I've actually
never had this much

19:32.667 --> 19:35.933
outside of a search warrant
when I worked in gangs.

19:35.967 --> 19:39.333
So... And we got
a nice blue color

19:39.367 --> 19:42.900
showing that it's testing
positive as a methamphetamine.

19:42.933 --> 19:45.600
He's gonna get booked on
the narcotics sales.

19:45.633 --> 19:47.133
He's also on probation,

19:47.167 --> 19:49.200
so we'll probably violate
his probation as well.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.367
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.333
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:55.367 --> 19:56.500
Cover is code three.

19:56.533 --> 19:59.500
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:05.767 --> 20:07.733
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:07.767 --> 20:08.933
-(theme music playing)
