00:38.669 --> 00:40.369
You coming to bed, hon?

00:40.404 --> 00:41.804
Just finishing up my nightlies.

00:48.478 --> 00:49.812
Oh, honey.

00:49.846 --> 00:51.881
I wish you wouldn't shove a
retainer full of cake

00:51.915 --> 00:53.215
in your mouth every night.

00:53.250 --> 00:56.319
But then I wouldn't taste
sweet chocolate in my dreams.

00:56.353 --> 00:57.720
Plus, I don't want to
change my routine

00:57.754 --> 00:59.021
before a big day like tomorrow.

00:59.056 --> 01:00.356
What's happening tomorrow?

01:00.390 --> 01:01.524
Ah, that's top secret.

01:01.558 --> 01:03.125
But I can give you a hint.

01:03.160 --> 01:08.230
I'm "poisoning...
a Russian... assassin."

01:08.265 --> 01:09.765
Fine, don't tell me.

01:09.800 --> 01:10.800
Well, good night.

01:12.035 --> 01:13.736
Stan, you forgot.

01:13.770 --> 01:15.471
It's Perfect Husband Time.

01:15.505 --> 01:17.340
Oh, right,
the 20 seconds per month

01:17.374 --> 01:19.408
I allot to your concerns.

01:19.443 --> 01:20.710
Go!

01:20.744 --> 01:22.511
Okay, uh-uh-um...
I-I-I saw

01:22.546 --> 01:23.913
another stray dog today, Stan.

01:23.947 --> 01:25.348
I was wondering
if we could adopt--

01:25.382 --> 01:27.149
Pass.
Okay, uh-uh-um...

01:27.184 --> 01:29.452
My parents asked if they could
see their children this year.

01:29.486 --> 01:30.619
Pass. Ten seconds down.

01:30.654 --> 01:32.188
I-I rented <i>The Notebook.</i>

01:32.222 --> 01:33.823
Can we please, please, please
Three, two, one.

01:33.857 --> 01:34.857
watch it tomorrow night?

01:38.128 --> 01:40.863
Oh... unfortunately
we've run out of time.

01:40.897 --> 01:42.732
But, you won't be
leaving empty-handed.

01:42.766 --> 01:45.534
All of our contestants
go home with a parting gift.

01:45.569 --> 01:46.569
Beep beep.

01:55.045 --> 01:56.812
Hey, brother, spare a quarter?

01:56.847 --> 01:59.582
"Spare" money, never
understood that.

01:59.616 --> 02:01.283
Now, if you want
to <i>earn</i> some money,

02:01.318 --> 02:03.285
I have noticed that my
shoelace is untied.

02:03.320 --> 02:05.821
So I'll offer you a nickel
to tie it for me.

02:12.596 --> 02:14.130
Here's a quarter.
Thanks.

02:14.164 --> 02:15.765
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
I said a nickel.

02:15.799 --> 02:16.899
I got change coming.

02:16.933 --> 02:17.900
I don't have any.

02:17.934 --> 02:18.968
No change?!

02:19.002 --> 02:21.337
This is how you
run a business?!

02:28.345 --> 02:31.781
Excuse me, where did you
get your shoelace tied?

02:31.815 --> 02:33.282
I do it myself, ma'am.

02:40.557 --> 02:42.925
- Sugar?
- I don't drink sugar.

02:44.294 --> 02:45.761
Damn it!

02:48.598 --> 02:49.698
Whoo-hoo!

02:50.400 --> 02:51.734
Congratulations, Smith.

02:51.768 --> 02:53.002
Wait, what's going on?

02:56.173 --> 02:57.640
That was your 100th kill.

02:58.708 --> 03:00.042
Get out of town.

03:00.076 --> 03:01.911
We all wanted
to be here for it.

03:01.945 --> 03:02.945
Well, thank you, sir.

03:02.979 --> 03:05.114
But I think
I only have 99 kills.

03:05.148 --> 03:06.949
We're counting
that agent who died

03:06.983 --> 03:09.118
when you refused to
give him some bone marrow.

03:09.152 --> 03:11.387
Even though you were
a perfect match.

03:11.421 --> 03:13.155
Happy 100th, Stan.

03:13.190 --> 03:14.723
It's not my birthday, dumb-ass.

03:14.758 --> 03:15.958
No! I meant a hundred--

03:15.992 --> 03:16.959
And a hundred.

03:16.993 --> 03:18.127
I look 40, tops.

03:18.161 --> 03:19.228
You look a hundred.

03:19.262 --> 03:20.729
Do-do-doesn't
Dick look a hundred?

03:20.764 --> 03:22.832
You do look old, Dick.

03:27.537 --> 03:29.805
No retainer full of
cake tonight, sweetie?

03:29.840 --> 03:32.208
Time to leave that
boyish tradition behind.

03:32.242 --> 03:33.876
I've killed a hundred people.

03:33.910 --> 03:35.277
I'm a man now.

03:35.312 --> 03:36.645
A hundred people?

03:36.680 --> 03:38.981
Plus I had 11 pieces
of cake at my party,

03:39.015 --> 03:41.484
and I threw up all over
the elevator buttons.

03:46.490 --> 03:48.491
Good morning, sweetie.

03:48.525 --> 03:49.492
What...?

03:49.526 --> 03:50.993
What are you smiling for?

03:51.027 --> 03:52.361
Why am I covered in cake?

03:52.395 --> 03:54.930
, hoy, you were so cute.

03:54.965 --> 03:56.465
You were sleepwalking.

03:56.500 --> 03:59.735
And I walked downstairs
and got some cake?

03:59.769 --> 04:02.137
That's not <i>all</i> you did.
What?!

04:02.172 --> 04:05.140
You sat me down and insisted
we watch <i>The Notebook.</i>

04:05.175 --> 04:07.243
I did not watch <i>The Notebook.</i>

04:07.277 --> 04:09.345
Boy, did you cry
when Noah bought

04:09.379 --> 04:11.046
the abandoned house
on the lake.

04:11.081 --> 04:13.182
Only because it fulfilled
Allie's lifelong dream.

04:13.216 --> 04:15.017
Oh, my God, I watched
<i>The Notebook!</i>

04:17.087 --> 04:18.254
What the hell is this?!

04:18.288 --> 04:19.522
That's Rashes.

04:19.555 --> 04:20.755
Our shelter dog.

04:20.790 --> 04:22.358
You adopted him last night.

04:22.392 --> 04:23.692
Why's he named Rashes?

04:23.727 --> 04:25.794
Ah! Oh, gross! Ah!

04:27.063 --> 04:28.330
Something terrible
happened to me!

04:28.365 --> 04:29.765
I have to see Dr. Penguin!

04:29.799 --> 04:31.834
Which one do you think, Stan?

04:31.868 --> 04:33.369
I'm leaning towards lilac.

04:33.403 --> 04:35.437
Roger, I don't want
to talk to Madam Buttercup!

04:35.472 --> 04:37.673
Oh, <i>that's</i> a good name.

04:37.707 --> 04:39.308
Okay, okay. Go lie on the couch.

04:42.312 --> 04:43.979
Dr. Penguin, it's terrible.

04:44.014 --> 04:45.381
Last night, I was sleepwalking

04:45.415 --> 04:47.516
and I did all these
horribly nice things.

04:47.551 --> 04:49.451
Nice things, eh?

04:49.486 --> 04:51.654
Seems like someone's
conscience is coming out.

04:51.688 --> 04:52.755
Of the closet?

04:52.789 --> 04:53.829
I don't have a conscience.

04:53.857 --> 04:54.890
Let alone a gay conscience.

04:54.925 --> 04:56.125
No conscience?

04:56.159 --> 04:58.961
Yeah. That's how
I'm so great at my job.

04:58.995 --> 05:01.597
Hmm. Often when you sleepwalk,

05:01.631 --> 05:03.065
the part of you
that you keep hidden

05:03.099 --> 05:04.800
finds its way to the surface.

05:04.834 --> 05:06.635
Did you rub poo on your shirt?

05:06.670 --> 05:08.203
What? God, no,
it's cake.

05:08.238 --> 05:09.305
Poo cake?

05:09.339 --> 05:11.106
I'm putting poo cake
in your file.

05:11.141 --> 05:13.242
Wait, no. Is that
my permanent record?

05:13.276 --> 05:15.244
This is just a straw.

05:15.278 --> 05:17.246
Anyway, I usually do
eat cake before bed,

05:17.280 --> 05:18.681
but last night I didn't.

05:18.715 --> 05:21.517
And then you sleepwalked
to the kitchen and ate some.

05:21.551 --> 05:23.652
It's simple,
you're a man of habit.

05:23.687 --> 05:25.621
Just go back to
eating cake before bed

05:25.655 --> 05:27.022
and everything
will go back to normal.

05:27.057 --> 05:28.524
Okay, that makes sense.

05:28.558 --> 05:29.758
There ya go.

05:29.793 --> 05:31.527
Well, we've got
40 minutes left.

05:31.561 --> 05:34.496
You want to hold my feet
while I try to do a sit-up?

05:39.102 --> 05:41.170
Ah... forget it.

05:50.513 --> 05:52.214
Have you seen Rashes?

05:52.248 --> 05:53.916
Oh, I gave him to a family.

05:53.950 --> 05:56.251
Well, I-I guess you
could call them a family.

05:56.286 --> 05:58.387
There was a man,
he was like the father.

05:58.421 --> 06:01.156
There was no mom and no kids,
but a couple other men.

06:01.191 --> 06:02.458
So, like four dads.

06:02.492 --> 06:04.860
And they all worked
at a Korean restaurant.

06:07.697 --> 06:09.732
Mmm. What a sleep.

06:11.201 --> 06:13.669
Thank you, cake. Oh!

06:14.504 --> 06:15.904
Good, you're awake.

06:15.939 --> 06:18.007
Well, wait.
How did I get here?

06:18.041 --> 06:21.443
You came in the middle
of the night to answer our ad...

06:21.478 --> 06:23.045
and our prayers.

06:23.079 --> 06:24.146
Wait, ad for what?

06:24.180 --> 06:27.016
To be director of the orphanage!

06:27.050 --> 06:29.051
The orphans can't wait
to meet you.

06:29.085 --> 06:30.486
But I-I was sleepwalking.

06:30.520 --> 06:33.022
I thought maybe you were.

06:33.056 --> 06:34.857
But you're also
the only applicant

06:34.891 --> 06:35.991
who didn't play with himself

06:36.026 --> 06:38.560
while he examined
the children's files.

06:45.765 --> 06:47.245
Well, I-I don't know
if I deserve this

06:47.270 --> 06:48.737
just for taking a job.

06:48.772 --> 06:51.840
Well... you did pay off
the loan on our bus.

06:51.875 --> 06:52.875
I what?!

06:54.911 --> 06:58.347
Huh, now, did I give you
any of my contact information?

06:58.381 --> 07:01.183
Like, like how to find me
if I were to suddenly disappear?

07:01.217 --> 07:02.418
Not yet.

07:02.452 --> 07:03.852
If you'd like to
come to my office--

07:06.890 --> 07:08.123
What is going on?!

07:08.158 --> 07:10.693
Why do you keep doing
nice things in your sleep?

07:10.727 --> 07:12.561
Because you're a nice man.

07:14.431 --> 07:16.265
That's why you adopted me...

07:16.299 --> 07:17.466
Daddy.

07:24.074 --> 07:26.742
Oh, no, what have I done?!

07:29.312 --> 07:31.613
Oh, thank God. It turned green.

07:35.332 --> 07:37.166
Are you sure
you need more coffee?

07:37.201 --> 07:38.735
You haven't slept in two days.

07:38.769 --> 07:39.769
I can't sleep.

07:39.803 --> 07:41.537
Who knows what
sleepwalking me will do.

07:41.572 --> 07:43.640
Probably something really nice.

07:43.674 --> 07:45.008
Hey, I'm nice, too.

07:45.042 --> 07:46.442
But in metered doses.

07:46.477 --> 07:48.544
The sleepwalking
version of me is too nice.

07:48.579 --> 07:50.146
He's like Michael Keaton nice.

07:50.180 --> 07:51.414
Michael Keaton?

07:51.448 --> 07:53.883
He didn't have to
pose for that picture.

07:55.019 --> 07:57.186
Honey, you're all frazzled.

07:57.221 --> 07:59.222
You need some sleep.

07:59.256 --> 08:00.590
All right,
five-minute power nap.

08:00.624 --> 08:01.691
I'm setting an alarm,

08:01.725 --> 08:03.493
but don't let me sleep
a minute longer.

08:03.527 --> 08:05.061
Got it.

08:15.205 --> 08:17.940
"Dear Stan, I'll need
more than five minutes

08:17.975 --> 08:20.410
"to do all the good deeds
I have planned.

08:20.444 --> 08:23.112
So I drugged your coffee.
Night, night."

08:23.147 --> 08:24.380
What the hell?!

08:24.415 --> 08:25.782
Sleeping pills?!

08:25.816 --> 08:26.916
Was I sleepwalking?!

08:26.950 --> 08:28.217
And did you let me
put these pills

08:28.252 --> 08:29.285
in my own coffee?!

08:29.319 --> 08:30.286
And then let me drink it?!

08:30.320 --> 08:31.621
Yeah. It was exciting.

08:31.655 --> 08:32.855
What else do I have going on?

08:40.297 --> 08:42.065
What do you call
one of these places?

08:42.099 --> 08:43.499
Where we are now?

08:43.534 --> 08:45.401
A home?
No kiddin'!

08:45.436 --> 08:46.636
After you went back to sleep,

08:46.670 --> 08:49.205
you opened a soup kitchen
in our living room.

08:49.239 --> 08:51.808
We fed 50 people today, Dad.

08:51.842 --> 08:54.043
Damn it.
Don't be so hard on yourself, Dad.

08:54.078 --> 08:56.012
Next time,
we'll feed a hundred.

08:57.748 --> 08:59.449
Is anyone peeing here?

08:59.483 --> 09:00.850
Yes.

09:03.387 --> 09:07.023
Smith, we've received word that
a Belgian terrorist is in town,

09:07.057 --> 09:08.591
and I want you to kill him.

09:09.626 --> 09:11.027
Smith, are you falling asleep?

09:11.061 --> 09:13.196
Ah, sorry sir,
just a little tired.

09:13.230 --> 09:14.464
Oh, not to worry.

09:14.498 --> 09:16.299
I've got some cocaine
right here.

09:16.333 --> 09:18.534
But... i-isn't that illegal?

09:18.569 --> 09:22.939
Ah... okay. You think
cocaine is a problem.

09:22.973 --> 09:25.575
But I've done it for 32 years.

09:25.609 --> 09:29.545
See, I'm part of a group of
responsible cocaine users.

09:29.580 --> 09:32.448
We adhere to strict rules
to ensure things don't

09:32.483 --> 09:33.583
get out of control.

09:33.617 --> 09:34.650
Rules, sir?

09:34.685 --> 09:37.253
It's not used to feel good.

09:37.287 --> 09:39.489
Not for base pleasure,
certainly.

09:39.523 --> 09:41.624
It's a medicine
to improve our lives,

09:41.658 --> 09:43.993
like penicillin or opium.

09:44.027 --> 09:46.062
Uh, I-I think I'll just
get some shuteye.

09:46.096 --> 09:47.196
Of course, of course.

09:47.231 --> 09:49.465
Perhaps opium
is more your speed.

09:49.500 --> 09:52.802
See, I'm also part of a group
of responsible opium users.

09:52.836 --> 09:54.476
Actually, I'm just gonna
go do my mission.

09:54.505 --> 09:55.872
More for me, then.

09:55.906 --> 09:58.241
Would you mind locking my door
on the way out?

09:58.275 --> 09:59.509
Yes, sir.

10:04.414 --> 10:07.183
I can play the bass solo
to "My Generation."

10:07.217 --> 10:09.418
Bum-didabum-dibum- dibum-bum-bum...

10:09.453 --> 10:11.754
Bum-didabum-dibum-
dibum-bum-bum...

10:17.194 --> 10:19.295
Where are you off to,
shiny briefcase?

10:19.329 --> 10:20.830
To kill another terrorist.

10:20.864 --> 10:23.933
Oh. There's something
you might want to see first.

10:23.967 --> 10:27.503
So, your sleepwalking self
came to me earlier.

10:28.605 --> 10:30.573
Oh, hi, awake Stan.

10:30.607 --> 10:31.908
I didn't see you there.

10:31.942 --> 10:34.710
I was just reading my favorite
best seller, <i>The Bible.</i>

10:34.745 --> 10:36.813
We shot this in
a home you built

10:36.847 --> 10:38.414
for Habitat for Humanity.
Shh.

10:38.448 --> 10:41.184
I thought it was about time
we had a little chat.

10:41.218 --> 10:43.319
You see, I'm your conscience.

10:43.353 --> 10:44.854
You killed a hundred people

10:44.888 --> 10:47.924
and I'm not letting you kill
anyone ever again.

10:47.958 --> 10:49.725
Plus, I'm gonna keep doing
everything I can

10:49.760 --> 10:51.761
to make up for what you've done.

10:51.795 --> 10:53.796
That's great.
You're really digging deep

10:53.831 --> 10:54.931
and I'm proud of you.

10:54.965 --> 10:56.933
Now, there's just
the issue of your payment.

10:56.967 --> 10:58.534
I'm sorry, I'm tapped out.

10:58.569 --> 11:00.069
I keep giving away money.

11:00.103 --> 11:03.139
Well... I accept
several forms of payment.

11:03.173 --> 11:05.208
Whoa-ho! Don't need
to see that!

11:05.242 --> 11:06.943
From here on out,
it's just bookkeeping.

11:06.977 --> 11:09.478
This goody-goody
thinks he runs my life.

11:09.513 --> 11:10.613
He can't stop me!

11:15.352 --> 11:16.686
So... just like that?

11:16.720 --> 11:17.920
Mmm, higher.

11:17.955 --> 11:19.255
You turned the
camera off, right?

11:19.289 --> 11:20.523
Don't talk! Don't talk.

11:31.134 --> 11:34.203
If I'm gonna pull
this off, I got to be sharp.

11:34.238 --> 11:36.305
So, just a little shuteye.

11:36.340 --> 11:38.341
But I'll be damned
if I'm gonna let sleepwalking me

11:38.375 --> 11:39.475
screw up my mission.

11:42.179 --> 11:43.980
I left an envelope
at the front desk.

11:44.014 --> 11:46.182
Have a bellboy bring it to me
in 25 minutes.

12:03.667 --> 12:05.835
Just as I planned...

12:11.675 --> 12:14.043
Couldn't get the bed
through the door, huh?

12:14.077 --> 12:16.312
Sorry, buttmunch. I win.

12:28.091 --> 12:30.026
What the hell?

12:35.632 --> 12:36.899
Gummy bears?!

12:36.934 --> 12:38.367
He replaced my bullets

12:38.402 --> 12:40.536
with gummy bears
from the minibar.

12:40.570 --> 12:42.271
That's gonna cost me
seven dollars!

12:42.306 --> 12:43.839
Oh, he left money.

12:43.874 --> 12:45.207
Well, I can't be mad about--

12:45.242 --> 12:46.409
Wait, that's my money!

12:48.946 --> 12:51.047
All right, this Belgian
is not going to

12:51.081 --> 12:52.515
slip through our fingers again.

12:52.549 --> 12:56.285
We have intel that he's planning
an attack on the downtown IHOP.

12:56.320 --> 12:59.121
And this is a
very important IHOP to me.

12:59.156 --> 13:01.390
It's where I saw the kid
from <i>The Blind Side.</i>

13:01.425 --> 13:03.926
Sir, sir! I know you're
assigning a wet team

13:03.961 --> 13:05.161
to take out
the Belgian terrorist.

13:05.195 --> 13:06.929
But I want to be
the one to do it.

13:06.964 --> 13:07.930
Forget it, Smith.

13:07.965 --> 13:09.865
You had your chance
and you blew it.

13:09.900 --> 13:12.201
And you bought some
really expensive candy.

13:12.235 --> 13:13.235
But you don't understand!

13:13.236 --> 13:14.804
I have to do this!

13:14.838 --> 13:17.807
I have to prove to someone that
he can't stop me from killing.

13:17.841 --> 13:20.543
Who?
Well, it's... it's me.

13:20.577 --> 13:22.945
It's hard to explain,
but there's a part of me

13:22.980 --> 13:24.780
that doesn't want me
to kill anymore.

13:24.815 --> 13:26.382
Is it the same part of you

13:26.416 --> 13:28.584
that forgot to pull up
his fly this morning?

13:28.618 --> 13:29.752
Uhp, sorry.

13:29.786 --> 13:31.687
Leave it, Smith.

13:33.724 --> 13:37.059
Yes... that's very nice.

13:37.094 --> 13:38.928
But this is very concerning.

13:38.962 --> 13:40.863
If you can't
bring yourself to kill,

13:40.897 --> 13:43.632
then there's no longer
a place for you at the CIA.

13:43.667 --> 13:44.633
I'm afraid you're fired.

13:44.668 --> 13:45.501
Fired?!

13:45.535 --> 13:46.936
Yes. And from now on,

13:46.970 --> 13:48.537
if you see me on the street,

13:48.572 --> 13:51.574
understand that I'll have
to pretend I don't know you.

13:51.608 --> 13:53.609
It'll look something like this.

14:00.965 --> 14:02.527
I'm really up a creek,
Dr. Penguin.

14:02.647 --> 14:04.701
Wait, hold that thought.

14:05.995 --> 14:07.295
Ah, I can never get this.

14:07.329 --> 14:09.164
Is it too cool in here?
I'm fine.

14:09.198 --> 14:11.733
But are you... are you close
to not being fine, maybe?

14:11.767 --> 14:12.767
Like, on the cool side?

14:12.802 --> 14:13.802
I'll turn it up.

14:13.836 --> 14:15.603
I got to get a
digital one of these.

14:15.638 --> 14:17.405
I got to get in
the 21st century.

14:17.439 --> 14:19.440
I got to join up.

14:21.377 --> 14:23.645
I know I'm going to be
too warm in a minute.

14:23.679 --> 14:24.813
So, did you kill
that terrorist?

14:24.847 --> 14:28.049
No. Sleepwalking Stan
got in the way.

14:28.083 --> 14:30.485
And now that I can't kill,
Bullock fired me.

14:31.654 --> 14:34.155
Looks like my
goody two-shoes side won.

14:34.190 --> 14:36.024
Not necessarily.

14:36.058 --> 14:37.025
What do you mean?

14:37.059 --> 14:38.226
Well, your conscience says

14:38.260 --> 14:40.161
he's not going to
let you kill again.

14:40.196 --> 14:42.197
So, all you have to do
is kill someone

14:42.231 --> 14:44.432
and he'll realize you're
the one calling the shots

14:44.466 --> 14:46.301
and he'll have to
leave you alone forever.

14:46.335 --> 14:48.036
But I can't kill
that terrorist.

14:48.070 --> 14:49.337
I'm not in the CIA anymore.

14:49.371 --> 14:50.605
Forget the terrorist.

14:50.639 --> 14:53.241
You just have to find
any bad guy and kill him.

14:53.275 --> 14:54.709
Then you'll be back
to your old self

14:54.743 --> 14:55.844
and you can get your job back.

14:55.878 --> 14:57.979
I suppose, but who can I kill?

14:58.013 --> 15:00.348
Well, just off
the top of my head,

15:00.382 --> 15:01.850
Jeff Watley.
Who's that?

15:01.884 --> 15:02.851
Real bad guy.

15:02.885 --> 15:03.985
Worst of the worst.

15:04.019 --> 15:05.019
Just awful.

15:05.054 --> 15:06.120
Come on, I'll
explain on the way.

15:06.155 --> 15:08.356
This Watley's a real sicko.

15:08.390 --> 15:11.226
Got nabbed for sex trafficking
in Lower Manhattan

15:11.260 --> 15:12.260
right after 9/11.

15:12.294 --> 15:13.895
He was running a
kiddie porn ring,

15:13.929 --> 15:16.030
but before the Feds
could drop the net on him,

15:16.065 --> 15:18.032
he moved the whole
operation to Nova Scotia,

15:18.067 --> 15:19.767
where it's <i>nice</i> and legal.

15:19.802 --> 15:21.269
So, he's got it coming.

15:21.303 --> 15:22.704
Oh, it doesn't stop there.

15:22.738 --> 15:25.607
Guy starts moving drugs
between Nogales and Tucson.

15:25.641 --> 15:27.542
This case actually
goes to trial,

15:27.576 --> 15:29.677
but Benton was
on the bench, so...

15:29.712 --> 15:30.833
need I say more?

15:30.846 --> 15:32.347
Only if you want me
to understand.

15:35.618 --> 15:37.318
Okay. With this guy,
you're going to want

15:37.353 --> 15:39.454
to shoot him in the face
and ask questions later.

15:39.488 --> 15:40.989
Very bad person.

15:42.091 --> 15:43.324
All right, we're here.

15:44.393 --> 15:45.627
Take whatever you want!

15:45.661 --> 15:46.828
Please don't hurt me!

15:46.862 --> 15:49.364
It's payback time,
you son of a bitch!

15:49.398 --> 15:50.665
What?!

15:50.699 --> 15:52.200
Hey... I remember you.

15:52.234 --> 15:54.235
You're that guy
who freaked out when I got

15:54.270 --> 15:56.271
the last pretzel at Wetzel's,
like, two weeks ago.

15:56.305 --> 15:57.639
What are you
waiting for?! Kill him!

15:57.673 --> 15:59.440
Pretzel?

15:59.475 --> 16:01.476
What about all that horrible
stuff you said he did?

16:01.510 --> 16:02.543
I was lying.

16:02.578 --> 16:03.811
But it doesn't change the fact

16:03.846 --> 16:05.079
that once you kill this guy

16:05.114 --> 16:06.748
you'll be free
of your conscience.

16:06.782 --> 16:08.216
And I'll have my vengeance.

16:08.250 --> 16:10.351
No, Roger, it doesn't
work like that.

16:10.386 --> 16:13.087
I only kill to protect my
country and people I love.

16:13.122 --> 16:15.456
I only kill because I have to.

16:15.491 --> 16:16.824
Wait a minute.

16:16.859 --> 16:19.327
What if sleepwalking me
had to kill?

16:21.230 --> 16:22.530
What are you talking about?

16:22.564 --> 16:25.033
Well, the terrorist is
planning to blow up an IHOP.

16:25.067 --> 16:28.670
So, I just need to put everyone
sleepwalking Stan loves

16:28.704 --> 16:32.073
into that IHOP, fall asleep,
and make sleepwalking Stan

16:32.107 --> 16:33.942
kill the terrorist himself.

16:33.976 --> 16:35.043
If he refuses,

16:35.077 --> 16:36.844
he'll have to see
everyone he loves

16:36.879 --> 16:38.513
get blown to pieces.

16:38.547 --> 16:40.214
Seems like a perfect plan to me.

16:40.249 --> 16:41.950
But then again, I've only had
three hours of sleep

16:41.984 --> 16:43.284
in the last week and a half.

16:44.720 --> 16:46.321
I even offered you the pretzel!

16:46.355 --> 16:48.056
Yeah, after you
drowned it in mustard!

16:48.090 --> 16:49.324
This isn't over, Watley!

17:29.465 --> 17:30.999
Come on, guys, it's time to eat.

17:46.749 --> 17:48.649
There you are, Stan.

17:48.684 --> 17:51.085
Why did you want us
to meet you at an IHOP?

17:51.120 --> 17:52.587
Oh, good, you came.

17:52.621 --> 17:54.389
There's no way he'll
let you guys die.

17:54.423 --> 17:55.723
Um... what?

17:55.758 --> 17:57.525
Just sit tight,
you're going to love this.

17:59.628 --> 18:01.763
This IHOP has desecrated

18:01.797 --> 18:02.964
the Belgian waffle

18:02.998 --> 18:04.699
for the last time!

18:04.733 --> 18:07.835
What you call the
"Rooty Tooty Fresh 'N Fruity"

18:07.870 --> 18:10.805
I call spitting in the face
of my countrymen!

18:10.839 --> 18:12.507
But that's served with pancakes.

18:12.541 --> 18:14.275
Shut up, pig dog!

18:17.179 --> 18:18.613
Oh, no!

18:18.647 --> 18:19.947
Save us, Stan!

18:19.982 --> 18:21.282
You got it, babe.

18:21.316 --> 18:22.283
Good night.

18:25.654 --> 18:28.022
Ah, oh, what's going on?

18:32.628 --> 18:35.296
Oh, I'm at IHOP
with everyone I love!

18:35.330 --> 18:36.831
What a perfect Sunday.

18:36.865 --> 18:39.667
Dad, that crazy French guy
is going to kill us all!

18:39.701 --> 18:40.968
Y-You got to stop him!

18:44.139 --> 18:46.207
But that's not me.

18:46.241 --> 18:47.341
I can't kill anyone.

18:47.376 --> 18:48.509
You have to, Dad!

18:48.544 --> 18:50.044
You have to save us!

18:50.079 --> 18:51.579
But I... I can't.

18:51.613 --> 18:53.548
It's... it's wrong.

18:53.582 --> 18:56.250
Not when you're protecting
your loved ones.

18:56.285 --> 18:57.852
For Belgium!

19:15.170 --> 19:17.405
Oh, good, I didn't
have to kill him.

19:18.574 --> 19:20.141
Mister, no!
What are you doing?!

19:22.578 --> 19:24.679
Please, don't make me do it!

19:27.015 --> 19:28.983
Come on, now. I'm-I'm
giving you a chance here.

19:31.420 --> 19:32.920
This is terrible.

19:32.955 --> 19:35.022
You're hurting us both,
almost equally.

19:35.057 --> 19:36.357
Nobody's winning here.

19:36.391 --> 19:37.558
This is awful.

19:37.593 --> 19:39.193
Oh, man, he's still reaching!

19:39.228 --> 19:40.428
Aw, gee whiz.

19:41.730 --> 19:43.831
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, God! Oh, God!

19:43.866 --> 19:46.601
Oh, God!
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

19:46.635 --> 19:49.003
It's over.

19:50.572 --> 19:52.406
I won't have what he's having.

19:57.479 --> 19:59.847
Yes, sir. Thank you.

19:59.882 --> 20:01.015
Well, that was Bullock.

20:01.049 --> 20:03.484
He was calling me
to offer my job back and...

20:03.519 --> 20:05.119
two pounds of mushrooms.

20:05.154 --> 20:06.721
That's great, honey!

20:06.755 --> 20:08.589
And I hope
you said yes to both.

20:08.624 --> 20:09.590
Sleep well.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.025
Oh, I will.

20:11.059 --> 20:14.395
I don't think my conscience is
going to bother me anymore.

20:14.429 --> 20:16.164
Good night.

20:28.911 --> 20:30.178
What are you doing here?

20:30.212 --> 20:31.612
I thought I got rid of you.

20:31.647 --> 20:32.613
Oh, no.

20:32.648 --> 20:34.048
You got me to kill a man.

20:34.082 --> 20:35.516
And now I understand

20:35.551 --> 20:38.119
that the world's not as
black-and-white as I thought.

20:38.153 --> 20:39.654
It's gray.

20:39.688 --> 20:42.523
That's why it takes two of us
to ride through this world.

20:42.558 --> 20:44.358
So... we're partners?

20:44.393 --> 20:45.826
Till the bitter end.

20:45.861 --> 20:47.094
All right, then, friend.

20:47.129 --> 20:48.729
Put 'er there!

20:50.252 --> 20:52.186
Hyah!
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!
