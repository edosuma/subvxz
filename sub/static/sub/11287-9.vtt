WEBVTT

00:05.766 --> 00:07.633
(Synclaire)
Regine, why am
I doing this again?

00:11.066 --> 00:14.166
To stop unsightly laugh lines
and crow's‐feet

00:14.233 --> 00:15.866
even before they begin.

00:15.933 --> 00:17.100
Well, how come
you don't use 'em?

00:17.166 --> 00:18.633
I don't need them.

00:20.100 --> 00:22.433
Regine, how long do I keep
my feet in this thing?

00:22.500 --> 00:23.700
Honey, I've seen the corns

00:23.766 --> 00:25.700
you might wanna just
settle on in for the night.

00:28.133 --> 00:30.100
‐ Hey, y'all.
‐ No!

00:30.166 --> 00:32.433
Hey, Joe. Joe, I really
had a really good time.

00:32.500 --> 00:35.700
I‐I would love to invite you in
but there's, uh..

00:35.766 --> 00:38.200
...some major reconstruction
going on, I'll see you later.

00:39.600 --> 00:42.000
Okay. What the hell?

00:42.066 --> 00:45.700
For your information,
we are having a beauty night.

00:46.400 --> 00:48.000
It ain't working.

00:49.133 --> 00:50.066
[doorbell ringing]

00:50.133 --> 00:52.100
Uh, be right there.

00:52.166 --> 00:53.533
What is this guy's name?

00:53.600 --> 00:56.333
Uh, sounds like a sandwich.

00:56.966 --> 00:58.400
Filet‐O‐Fish?

00:59.566 --> 01:01.606
Yeah, Synclaire. That's it.

01:06.540 --> 01:08.473
Reuben!

01:09.539 --> 01:10.473
Bye.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.240
Man, that used to be us.

01:16.240 --> 01:18.806
Dates back to back,
couldn't keep 'em straight.

01:20.073 --> 01:23.106
Now, look at us. Manless.

01:23.173 --> 01:25.873
Excuse you. We have men.

01:25.940 --> 01:27.206
That's right.

01:27.273 --> 01:30.440
I got somebody who'd look
at these corns, and still smile.

01:32.273 --> 01:34.006
I may not have a man
at the moment.

01:34.073 --> 01:36.273
But it is not been that long
since I've had a date.

01:37.906 --> 01:40.806
Oh, my God.
It's been over two months.

01:40.873 --> 01:44.406
Things haven't been this bad
since the drought of '89.

01:44.473 --> 01:48.140
And that was only because I was
visiting friends in Alabama.

01:48.206 --> 01:49.773
And refused
to go out with anyone

01:49.840 --> 01:52.506
named Baby Brother,
Butter or Bookie.

Max, what's the legal angle
on the dispute

02:35.980 --> 02:38.413
between the Road Runner
and the Coyote?

02:40.580 --> 02:43.380
Well, he could charge
the Road Runner with battery.

02:43.446 --> 02:44.780
Trouble is
he's got no witnesses, you know

02:44.846 --> 02:46.780
he's a known
buyer of explosives.

02:46.846 --> 02:48.580
The bird could always
plead self‐defense.

02:48.646 --> 02:51.880
And you are talking
about a cartoon coyote.

02:51.946 --> 02:53.313
Get a life.

02:55.046 --> 02:56.980
[all whooping]

03:00.180 --> 03:01.720
Are you going out again?

03:01.786 --> 03:04.386
What is this, your third date
in sixteen hours?

03:04.453 --> 03:06.220
It's gotta be
some kind of record.

03:06.286 --> 03:09.686
What a coincidence. Regine is
working on her record herself.

03:11.220 --> 03:12.520
‐ What kind of record?
‐ Well, let's just say..

03:12.586 --> 03:14.253
The last time Regine had a date

03:14.320 --> 03:16.320
Hugh Grant
didn't have to buy his.

03:20.553 --> 03:23.786
You know, this sounds like
that drought you had in '89.

03:26.220 --> 03:27.253
[doorbell ringing]
Oh.

03:27.320 --> 03:29.720
That's my match, Davin.

03:29.786 --> 03:31.186
‐ Davin.
‐ Davin.

03:41.286 --> 03:42.953
Baby, I'm back.

03:46.053 --> 03:47.920
Yeah, Khadijah, look at that.

03:47.986 --> 03:49.586
I told you we could
count on Scooter.

03:49.653 --> 03:52.986
I mean he drops by every
11 months just like clockwork.

03:55.186 --> 03:57.053
Nice to see you too, Max.

03:57.120 --> 03:58.653
I had to cancel
the last leg of our tour.

03:58.720 --> 04:00.086
Our lead singer broke her nose

04:00.153 --> 04:02.060
when one of her garters
gave way.

04:03.526 --> 04:06.493
Dear God,
clothing can be dangerous.

04:06.560 --> 04:09.160
I once sprained my ankle
putting on flip‐flops.

04:11.493 --> 04:13.926
I really missed you, Khadijah.

04:13.993 --> 04:14.960
Well, I see
how that could happen

04:15.026 --> 04:16.392
over the course of a year.

04:16.459 --> 04:17.392
Oh!

04:17.459 --> 04:18.625
[mumbling]

04:21.360 --> 04:24.526
Uh, well, look. Hey, I'm happy
to see you, Scooter.

04:24.593 --> 04:26.493
Uh, let me give you
a little sports update.

04:26.560 --> 04:28.560
‐ Mmm.
‐ See, football didn't strike.

04:28.626 --> 04:30.293
Uh, basketball
almost had a strike.

04:30.360 --> 04:31.893
‐ Baseball in the day strike.
‐ Mmm.

04:31.960 --> 04:33.893
Personally I'm hopin'
for a damn golf strike.

04:35.693 --> 04:37.893
So, Scooter.

04:39.026 --> 04:40.060
‐ What'd ya bring me back?
‐ Oh, oh.

04:40.126 --> 04:41.760
I know you brought me
something back.

04:41.826 --> 04:43.260
I know you like
to buy me a gift.

04:43.326 --> 04:44.826
Ha‐ha!

04:44.893 --> 04:47.526
One hundred percent human hair
from the Philippines.

04:54.760 --> 04:57.993
Oh, y'all, she used conditioner.
Oh!

04:59.926 --> 05:02.666
And, Synclaire, heh.
I got you these tapes.

05:04.100 --> 05:06.200
"How to speak English
in fourteen days?"

05:07.666 --> 05:10.666
‐ It's in German.
‐ Oh. Oh.

05:10.733 --> 05:14.833
Max. I got you the hottest
new video game from Japan.

05:14.900 --> 05:17.700
‐ "Blooded Teeth of Justice."
‐ Mmm.

05:17.766 --> 05:19.033
Gimme that.

05:20.166 --> 05:23.566
Eh, it's no bag of hair,
but I'll take it.

05:29.966 --> 05:32.033
So, uh, Terrence.

05:32.100 --> 05:33.733
Uh, you got any more
international trinkets

05:33.800 --> 05:35.866
in that bag? You know, uh..

05:38.300 --> 05:41.466
Oh‐oh‐oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, you know, uh..

05:41.533 --> 05:43.633
You know that, uh,
I‐I never forget my boys.

05:43.700 --> 05:45.666
‐ You know what I'm saying?
‐ Yeah, yeah, come, I'm waiting.

05:45.733 --> 05:47.333
Yeah, yeah, here.

05:49.833 --> 05:53.100
Oh, wow. A Jetway magazine.

05:54.633 --> 05:58.433
And you've even taken care to do
the crossword puzzle for me.

05:58.500 --> 06:00.140
Gee, thanks.

06:00.906 --> 06:01.840
Headphones.

06:03.306 --> 06:06.773
Yeah, all I need now is a DC‐10,
I'm in business.

06:10.373 --> 06:12.306
Khadijah, I got you something
in Australia.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.973
See when I saw this,
I immediately thought of us.

06:17.040 --> 06:20.640
No matter how far a boomerang
flies, it always comes back.

06:23.206 --> 06:24.140
[doorbell rings]

06:25.506 --> 06:27.473
Uh, look I would love
to stay here

06:27.540 --> 06:30.006
and catch up with you
but I kinda made other plans.

06:31.073 --> 06:33.006
‐ Hey, Davin.
‐ Hello.

06:33.073 --> 06:36.606
Well, if your game is as good
as you look, I'm in trouble.

06:39.306 --> 06:40.740
See ya.

06:43.373 --> 06:44.940
Thanks, man!

06:52.106 --> 06:54.006
You know, I can't believe
Scooter thinks he could just

06:54.073 --> 06:56.640
stroll up in here and pick up
where he left off.

06:59.140 --> 07:01.080
But he's so cute though.

07:03.113 --> 07:04.880
You know, thrown just right

07:04.946 --> 07:07.046
you could take somebody's
head off with this thing.

07:08.046 --> 07:09.546
[imitating boomerang]

07:13.680 --> 07:15.780
What the heck,
and why would you?

07:17.680 --> 07:18.846
Hey.

07:18.913 --> 07:21.313
We have plenty of food
in the fridge. What is all this?

07:21.380 --> 07:23.980
We took a little trip
to the frozen food section

07:24.046 --> 07:27.580
or as I like to call it,
bachelor row.

07:27.646 --> 07:29.913
I figured I'd get
a hungry man dinner

07:29.980 --> 07:31.913
and perhaps a hungry man.

07:33.546 --> 07:36.546
I can't believe I came up empty.

07:36.613 --> 07:39.413
I suggested she stand next
to the imported beer fridge.

07:39.480 --> 07:41.046
But no.

07:42.313 --> 07:43.580
[phone ringing]

07:45.580 --> 07:47.146
Hello.

07:47.213 --> 07:49.413
Yes, she is. One moment.

07:49.480 --> 07:51.813
Regine, it's some guy for you.

07:52.580 --> 07:54.080
Gimme that.

07:56.046 --> 07:58.313
Hello, this is Regine Hunter.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.986
Oh, yeah.

08:02.053 --> 08:04.586
It's the carpet cleaner.

08:04.653 --> 08:05.920
Ah, yeah, listen, um..

08:05.986 --> 08:08.153
I got this big wine stain
on my rug

08:08.220 --> 08:10.686
and it's domestic,
so it's got to go.

08:13.020 --> 08:15.553
My voice is not sexy.

08:17.886 --> 08:19.853
It is not..

08:20.920 --> 08:21.920
...sexy.

08:25.186 --> 08:29.020
Dinner? Oh, well,
aren't we forward?

08:29.086 --> 08:30.020
Where?

08:31.786 --> 08:35.120
Uh, could you hold on
a moment, thanks.

08:35.186 --> 08:37.120
What? I'm about to get a date.

08:38.686 --> 08:41.086
Think about it, desperado.

08:41.153 --> 08:42.720
Now, what guy do you know
that would go out

08:42.785 --> 08:44.353
with a woman sight unseen?

08:44.420 --> 08:46.953
The kind who lives
in his mom's basement.

08:50.186 --> 08:51.920
Uh, Cleophus..

08:51.986 --> 08:54.086
(all)
Cleophus?

08:54.153 --> 08:56.053
Oh, God.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.353
That's just Latin for ugly.

09:00.626 --> 09:04.726
Uh, listen, about dinner? No.

09:04.793 --> 09:06.693
[doorbell rings]

09:06.760 --> 09:08.026
Take heart, Regine.

09:08.093 --> 09:09.826
I mean, maybe that's
the Roto‐Rooter man

09:09.893 --> 09:11.826
and you can throw
yourself at him, alright?

09:15.726 --> 09:19.126
Oh, let me guess.
Baby, I'm back again.

09:22.126 --> 09:24.793
Uh, Khadijah, I was wondering,
can we go some place and talk?

09:26.426 --> 09:28.993
Um, we'll go up on the roof.

09:29.060 --> 09:30.393
It's kinda cold up there,
isn't it?

09:30.460 --> 09:32.326
Well, I got a feeling
whatever we talk

09:32.393 --> 09:33.426
is going to be a little chilly.

09:33.493 --> 09:34.960
(Max)
'Darn right.'

09:35.026 --> 09:37.626
[Regine laughing]

09:41.826 --> 09:44.626
You got five minutes
to explain yourself.

09:44.693 --> 09:47.093
‐ Well, I wanted to call.
‐ Time is up!

09:47.160 --> 09:48.726
And how could you just
leave me hanging like that?

09:48.793 --> 09:50.993
Look, I know. I know I should've
called or written more, alright?

09:51.060 --> 09:53.060
But dealing with the group
an‐and the press

09:53.126 --> 09:54.326
and the time changes..

09:54.393 --> 09:55.860
And then weeks pass by,
after a while

09:55.926 --> 09:56.860
I just felt too
embarrassed to call.

09:56.926 --> 09:58.226
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

09:58.293 --> 09:59.393
Now, you know you
could've called me

09:59.460 --> 10:01.300
any time, day or night.

10:01.366 --> 10:04.433
Because I like a fool sat by
that phone for three months.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.600
Khadijah, I don't have
a good excuse for what I did.

10:06.666 --> 10:09.966
Alright?
Except to say I'm sorry.

10:11.966 --> 10:15.500
And you think an apology,
and this tired boomerang

10:15.566 --> 10:17.233
are gonna make
everything better?

10:17.300 --> 10:19.200
I am this close to hating you.

10:19.266 --> 10:21.200
As a matter of fact,
I really don't even wanna..

10:26.066 --> 10:28.633
Khadijah, will you marry me?

10:36.733 --> 10:37.733
Yes.

10:41.633 --> 10:43.100
Whoa, duck!

10:53.233 --> 10:56.966
That is the stupidest looking
grin I've ever seen.

10:57.033 --> 10:58.633
What have you two been doing?

11:00.040 --> 11:03.106
Ah! You got engaged!

11:05.040 --> 11:07.473
Oh, oh..
Khadijah's getting married.

11:09.540 --> 11:11.606
Right in the middle
of Regine's drought.

11:13.906 --> 11:17.106
I love it when life
is bittersweet.

11:17.173 --> 11:21.273
Yeah, oh, my God, you sure
are one smooth talker, huh?

11:21.340 --> 11:22.506
Yeah, yeah, you know,
I didn't think..

11:22.573 --> 11:23.640
I didn't think
you'd come back engaged.

11:23.706 --> 11:24.640
In fact, I didn't think
one of you'd

11:24.706 --> 11:27.273
come back at all.

11:27.340 --> 11:29.140
It needs to be sized,
but isn't it beautiful?

11:29.206 --> 11:33.506
Oh, well, I don't have my loupe,
but, oh, it has good fire

11:33.573 --> 11:36.373
very few occlusions,
color's about a 'G' or an 'H.'

11:37.473 --> 11:40.206
And it's almost two carats.

11:42.140 --> 11:44.106
That's a lot of love.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.173
Well, hey, hey,
excuse us people.

11:48.240 --> 11:51.240
Uh, we're gonna go upstairs
and, uh, call our parents.

11:53.306 --> 11:56.906
Well, um, you know,
there's a phone right here.

11:59.106 --> 12:01.046
Um, not for this call.

12:04.513 --> 12:05.913
[knocking on door]

12:05.980 --> 12:08.246
If you're not a burglar,
come on in.

12:11.113 --> 12:14.180
Oh, well, if it isn't
the marrying man.

12:14.246 --> 12:15.480
Hey, fellas.

12:15.546 --> 12:17.180
Alright, what are you doing

12:17.246 --> 12:19.813
Saturday, February 11th
at 1 p. m.?

12:19.880 --> 12:22.446
That'd be at my standing
head shave appointment

12:22.513 --> 12:24.446
at Snappy's Afro Hut.

12:26.213 --> 12:27.980
I assume I'll be
attending a wedding.

12:28.046 --> 12:28.980
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah.

12:29.046 --> 12:31.013
Sounds like we both got plans.

12:31.080 --> 12:32.846
What you got in mind, Scooter?

12:32.913 --> 12:35.480
‐ Brew?
‐ Yeah.

12:35.546 --> 12:38.513
February 11th is the day I start
my new life with Khadijah.

12:39.613 --> 12:41.546
And I want both y'all
to be there.

12:41.613 --> 12:42.913
Alright, I only got two
questions, money.

12:42.980 --> 12:45.080
‐ 'Hmm.'
‐ Is it formal?

12:45.146 --> 12:48.280
And why the hell are you
and Khadijah getting married?

12:48.346 --> 12:49.880
I don't know why
you're surprised, man.

12:49.946 --> 12:51.646
You know, Khadijah and I were
probably gonna get married

12:51.713 --> 12:53.046
somewhere down the line.

12:53.113 --> 12:56.080
Whoa, ho‐ho ho‐ho. "Probably?"

12:56.146 --> 12:57.413
"Somewhere down the line?"

12:57.480 --> 12:58.546
What are you gonna
say to the minister?

12:58.613 --> 13:01.386
I do, I think?

13:01.453 --> 13:05.486
Yeah, hold up, homey, 'cause
Khadijah's like family to us.

13:05.553 --> 13:07.853
You better be a hundred percent
sure before you stand up

13:07.920 --> 13:11.153
in front of God
and that one drunk relative

13:11.220 --> 13:13.020
who just can't seem to wait
for the reception.

13:13.086 --> 13:15.253
‐ You know, Uncle Scoop.
‐ Yeah.

13:15.320 --> 13:16.420
Well, homies,
I'll tell you something.

13:16.486 --> 13:18.886
‐ I'm not a 100 percent sure.
‐ Uh‐huh.

13:18.953 --> 13:21.286
I'm 200 percent sure.

13:21.353 --> 13:22.753
I'm 300 percent sure.

13:22.820 --> 13:25.853
Hell, I'm 400 percent sure.

13:27.953 --> 13:30.753
Okay, you are whole hell
of a lot of sure. Uh.

13:32.053 --> 13:33.120
You know, I get the feeling
y'all don't think

13:33.186 --> 13:34.953
this is a good idea.

13:35.020 --> 13:38.120
What we think
is really not relevant.

13:38.186 --> 13:39.753
Uh, but I want your opinion.

13:39.820 --> 13:41.720
Not that I'm not rock solid
in my position.

13:41.786 --> 13:42.720
‐ You know?
‐ 'Heh‐heh.'

13:42.786 --> 13:44.053
Alright.

13:44.120 --> 13:46.053
Well, I'll tell you
what I think.

13:47.320 --> 13:49.186
I think you, uh,
you got a little lonely

13:49.253 --> 13:50.453
out on tour.

13:50.520 --> 13:54.253
Eh‐heh. And that you kinda
missed Khadijah. Yeah?

13:54.320 --> 13:55.853
Mm‐hmm.

13:55.920 --> 13:57.386
Then you come back home

13:57.453 --> 14:01.026
and find out things
is a little shaky.

14:01.093 --> 14:03.626
And so you made
an impulsive decision

14:03.693 --> 14:07.360
that could lead
to a very rocky marriage.

14:08.326 --> 14:10.660
And a sad, sad life.

14:13.860 --> 14:15.626
Oh, I'm so excited.

14:15.693 --> 14:17.426
A February wedding.

14:17.493 --> 14:19.926
Oh, the snow will be
falling all around us.

14:19.993 --> 14:23.126
You'll be able to see your
breath as you recite your vows.

14:24.260 --> 14:27.493
Synclaire, the wedding
is gonna be inside.

14:27.560 --> 14:30.660
Oh. That's nice if you want
everything room temperature.

14:32.093 --> 14:33.393
Who cares where it is.

14:33.460 --> 14:35.626
Let's focus on the priorities.

14:35.693 --> 14:38.793
Now, I'll be the maid of honor,
since I photograph the best.

14:38.860 --> 14:42.393
And I want to wear
something a little different.

14:42.460 --> 14:45.093
Khadijah, you're making the
biggest mistake of your life!

14:48.093 --> 14:49.560
Thank God, somebody said it.

14:49.626 --> 14:52.226
Whoo, I was just about to.

14:53.226 --> 14:54.360
Did I miss something?

14:54.426 --> 14:57.093
Look. Khadijah, what happened?

14:57.160 --> 14:59.226
I mean, how can you
just trust him like this?

14:59.293 --> 15:01.366
What happened
to all that lovely hatred

15:01.433 --> 15:03.366
that you were developing
for him?

15:05.266 --> 15:07.700
I don't know.

15:07.766 --> 15:10.366
I was all ready
to tell him where to go.

15:10.433 --> 15:13.166
And then, when he proposed,
it just, it just came out <i>yes.</i>

15:15.633 --> 15:18.466
Have you really
thought this thing out?

15:20.466 --> 15:23.300
The ring turned you, didn't it?

15:23.366 --> 15:26.100
Two carats can be
very persuasive.

15:27.833 --> 15:30.733
Three carats and I'd marry
dang near anybody.

15:32.600 --> 15:33.966
Alright, now, Khadijah

15:34.033 --> 15:36.866
I've never been one to stand
in the way of the love train.

15:36.933 --> 15:38.300
[imitating train]

15:39.966 --> 15:42.233
But why are you in such
a rush for this thing?

15:42.300 --> 15:45.233
[gasps]
Oh, my God, you're pregnant.

15:45.300 --> 15:46.466
Okay, it's okay.

15:46.533 --> 15:48.933
And nobody needs to know,
but just us, okay?

15:49.000 --> 15:50.733
Woo‐woo‐woo. Woo‐woo‐woo.

15:50.800 --> 15:52.600
Bless you, Synclaire.

15:52.666 --> 15:54.600
Now the townspeople
won't stone me.

15:56.633 --> 15:59.133
Look, I'm marrying Scooter

15:59.200 --> 16:01.073
no matter what you think.

16:02.273 --> 16:03.373
And from what I'm hearing,
it sounds like

16:03.440 --> 16:05.006
y'all don't even
wanna be bridesmaids.

16:05.073 --> 16:06.106
Oh, no. I'll be there.

16:06.173 --> 16:08.306
I mean, I'll be hugging
a champagne bottle

16:08.373 --> 16:10.340
but I'll be there.

16:10.406 --> 16:12.073
I'm showin' you my dress.

16:17.573 --> 16:19.340
[doorbell ringing]

16:19.406 --> 16:20.673
Yeah, I know, mom.

16:20.740 --> 16:22.806
And I don't know
what's happening, but I..

16:24.673 --> 16:26.406
I'll call you back.

16:28.040 --> 16:30.040
Good afternoon.
I'm Cleophus Wade.

16:33.673 --> 16:35.173
The carpet cleaner?

16:35.240 --> 16:38.106
Well, w‐where's your jumpsuit?
Where's your hairnet?

16:38.173 --> 16:40.740
[laughs]
I'm afraid this
is the uniform you wear

16:40.806 --> 16:42.740
when you own the company.

16:44.073 --> 16:45.206
You must be Miss Hunter.

16:46.540 --> 16:48.473
Do come in.

16:49.106 --> 16:50.440
Listen.

16:50.506 --> 16:53.606
I wanted to come by
to give you a free estimate.

16:53.673 --> 16:56.706
Really? After the way
I spoke to you on the phone?

16:56.773 --> 16:59.306
Oh, what a sweet man you are.

16:59.373 --> 17:01.480
Oh, is that Cerruti?

17:01.546 --> 17:04.480
Uh‐huh. Miss Hunter.

17:04.546 --> 17:07.713
I appreciate what you did for me
when you hung up in my face.

17:07.780 --> 17:08.746
Oh..

17:08.813 --> 17:10.746
Afterwards, I realized..

17:10.813 --> 17:12.613
Life is too short.

17:12.680 --> 17:14.113
So, I decided to give
my ex‐girlfriend a call

17:14.180 --> 17:16.046
and we went out last night..

17:16.113 --> 17:18.713
And it was just like old times.

17:18.780 --> 17:20.646
Shopping on Fifth Avenue.

17:20.713 --> 17:22.413
Five‐course dinner.

17:22.480 --> 17:24.146
Afterwards, I took
the top off my Porsche

17:24.213 --> 17:26.113
and we drove
down to Atlantic City

17:26.180 --> 17:29.413
'for an evening of Cognac,
Blackjack and Pebo.'

17:29.480 --> 17:31.380
God, I love that woman.

17:34.180 --> 17:35.446
Look, anyway, look, we,
we should really

17:35.513 --> 17:37.246
get to that wine stain, I..

17:37.313 --> 17:39.713
I've gotta pick
my lady up in an hour.

17:42.813 --> 17:44.513
Oh, forget about the stain.

17:44.580 --> 17:48.446
I'm‐I'm sure I can get it out
with, um, a‐a baking soda.

17:48.513 --> 17:50.880
Uh, baby wipes.

17:50.946 --> 17:52.313
Tears.

17:54.046 --> 17:56.413
Well, if you say so.

17:56.480 --> 17:57.946
That gives me enough time
to pick her up

17:58.013 --> 17:59.953
little something from Chanel.

18:01.886 --> 18:03.220
Hey, why don't you get him
to get you some.

18:03.286 --> 18:04.986
You love Chanel.

18:06.020 --> 18:08.253
Latin for ugly?

18:10.486 --> 18:11.886
Latin's a dead language.

18:11.953 --> 18:13.786
Sort of like your love life.
Meep‐meep!

18:16.953 --> 18:18.020
[chuckles]

18:18.086 --> 18:19.653
Uh, well,
if it isn't Mr. Scooter.

18:19.720 --> 18:20.786
Hey, Hyman.

18:20.853 --> 18:22.520
I'd like to introduce you
to my fiance.

18:22.586 --> 18:23.520
‐ Khadijah.
‐ Hi.

18:23.586 --> 18:25.820
Oh, mazel tov, woo‐hoo‐hoo.

18:25.886 --> 18:27.886
Damp hands. Somebody's nervous.

18:30.486 --> 18:32.920
Here, let‐let me,
let me size this for you.

18:32.986 --> 18:34.386
Scooter tells me

18:34.453 --> 18:36.486
you've known each other
your whole lives.

18:36.553 --> 18:39.186
Mm‐hmm. We were first grade
kickball champs.

18:39.253 --> 18:43.320
Ah, now. When you kick a ball
at a woman, you know her.

18:45.653 --> 18:47.120
It's nice to see

18:47.186 --> 18:50.520
young people having
solid relationships

18:50.586 --> 18:52.053
and getting married.

18:52.120 --> 18:53.786
It's‐it's good for business.

18:53.853 --> 18:55.086
In the 70s..

18:55.153 --> 18:56.820
...all those one‐night stands

18:56.886 --> 18:58.320
people shacking up..

18:58.386 --> 19:00.626
Nobody bought a wedding ring.

19:01.993 --> 19:05.726
All I could sell
was the occasional medallion.

19:05.793 --> 19:07.293
Nowadays

19:07.360 --> 19:08.660
people are taking the time

19:08.726 --> 19:10.426
to get to know each other

19:10.493 --> 19:13.460
and invest in a quality wedding.

19:13.526 --> 19:15.260
Take a look.

19:15.326 --> 19:16.860
Platinum, gold..

19:16.926 --> 19:19.093
Don't ask.

19:19.160 --> 19:20.560
I'll be right back.

19:22.826 --> 19:25.626
So, what, what do you think
about that ring?

19:25.693 --> 19:27.193
Umm, na.

19:27.260 --> 19:28.660
What about these?

19:28.726 --> 19:30.326
Na.

19:30.393 --> 19:32.326
‐ That one?
‐ Don't ask.

19:35.193 --> 19:37.593
Terrence, why did you
propose to me?

19:37.660 --> 19:38.960
What?

19:39.026 --> 19:40.293
Well, I just realized
that's one of the things

19:40.360 --> 19:42.093
I don't know about you.

19:42.160 --> 19:43.393
Why you proposed.

19:45.426 --> 19:48.960
Because, uh,
I wanted to get married.

19:49.026 --> 19:51.593
Uh, because you're
my best friend.

19:53.660 --> 19:56.393
Because I was
afraid of losing you.

19:56.460 --> 19:58.526
So you proposed out of fear?

19:58.593 --> 20:00.366
That's an awfully

20:00.433 --> 20:03.333
accurate way of putting it.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.133
Well, that's funny.

20:05.200 --> 20:07.566
'Cause that's
exactly why I accepted.

20:07.633 --> 20:09.166
Really?

20:09.233 --> 20:12.233
I didn't wanna lose you again.

20:12.300 --> 20:15.033
Look, Scooter, we weren't ready
to be married before you left.

20:15.100 --> 20:16.833
What makes you think
we are ready now?

20:18.766 --> 20:20.833
[exhales]
I don't know.

20:20.900 --> 20:22.066
I mean, I don't even know
if we're ready

20:22.133 --> 20:23.466
to pick up where we left off.

20:25.166 --> 20:27.100
Maybe we should
back things up.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.400
Can we back things up
to the point

20:30.466 --> 20:32.566
where we were friends?

20:34.233 --> 20:35.666
So are you breaking up with me?

20:37.900 --> 20:39.066
I think so.

20:40.100 --> 20:41.133
My girl.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.700
[laughing]

20:42.766 --> 20:45.000
Let me explain.

20:45.066 --> 20:47.166
It's a little warm now

20:47.233 --> 20:50.433
and it should feel
a bit loose

20:50.500 --> 20:52.866
but as the metal cools

20:52.933 --> 20:56.266
it should become more snug
and be a perfect fit.

20:56.333 --> 20:57.800
Hyman, we're not
getting married.

21:01.240 --> 21:03.806
You let me go through
this whole explanation?

21:05.240 --> 21:06.506
Sorry.

21:06.573 --> 21:07.806
I'm the one who's sorry.

21:07.873 --> 21:10.773
This is an $8000 sale.

21:10.840 --> 21:14.006
But, since I like you..

21:15.473 --> 21:18.073
My wife sadly didn't
make it to the bank.

21:21.673 --> 21:23.240
Here's your down payment.

21:24.706 --> 21:26.273
Hey, I appreciate that, Hyman.

21:26.340 --> 21:27.540
Eh..

21:29.706 --> 21:31.973
$8000?

21:32.040 --> 21:33.240
I'm a good friend.

21:35.173 --> 21:38.573
Well, lookie here, friend, I got
a little birthday coming up.

21:38.640 --> 21:40.073
<i>(female narrator)</i>
<i>We'll be right back.</i>

21:45.143 --> 21:46.408
Regine, what are you
doing up here?

21:46.475 --> 21:47.841
Don't you have a date with
some doctor in few minutes?

21:47.908 --> 21:49.308
Yeah. But my mom set this up.

21:49.375 --> 21:50.775
So I wanna get
a good look at this guy

21:50.841 --> 21:52.841
before I go anywhere with him.

21:52.908 --> 21:57.008
Yeah, she says he drives
some sort of yellow car.

21:57.075 --> 22:00.241
Like that yellow Ferrari
that just drove up?

22:00.308 --> 22:05.315
Ow, uh‐uh, and the license
plates says "HOT‐MD."

22:05.381 --> 22:06.715
He's getting out.

22:06.781 --> 22:07.915
Oh, my God.

22:07.981 --> 22:09.715
Oh, he's perfect. He's fine.

22:09.781 --> 22:10.848
Oh, he's mine.

22:10.915 --> 22:14.381
Ah. Yoo‐hoo!

22:14.448 --> 22:16.415
Be right down.

22:18.181 --> 22:20.015
[screaming]

22:22.315 --> 22:24.248
Damn! He is a good catch.

22:25.981 --> 22:27.515
<i>(female #1)</i>
<i>Woo‐hoo!</i>
