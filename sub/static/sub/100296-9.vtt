You okay with that?

00:04.650 --> 00:05.469
Ah, it's a free world.

00:05.520 --> 00:06.646
If he wants to--

00:07.130 --> 00:08.734
I've lost my purpose here.

00:08.790 --> 00:10.007
Especially since the accident.

00:10.050 --> 00:11.392
So what are you
gonna do about it?

00:11.440 --> 00:13.567
I know what I want.

to coordinate with him--

00:23.190 --> 00:24.441
No.

00:24.500 --> 00:25.797
You gonna run?
'Cause I think you should.

00:25.850 --> 00:26.919
It's not that simple.

00:26.980 --> 00:28.060
You want me to spy.

00:28.110 --> 00:30.101
If that means
looking out for yourself

00:30.160 --> 00:31.843

Destroyed a family.

01:16.420 --> 01:18.320
They'll sue you, the department,
and the county.

01:18.380 --> 01:20.598
You'll be put on leave,
then fired.

01:21.080 --> 01:22.763
Start a new career
working the drive-through.

01:23.080 --> 01:24.593
I didn't know he had a hostage.

01:24.640 --> 01:26.039
You were anticipating, boot.

Think before you shoot.

01:37.310 --> 01:38.561
How about you give me some tips

01:38.620 --> 01:40.008
instead of telling me
how bad I'm doing?

01:40.050 --> 01:41.176

03:42.700 --> 03:44.429
I was just thinking
the same thing.

03:46.180 --> 03:47.602
I wonder which kind it is.

03:49.140 --> 03:50.266
What do you mean?

03:51.700 --> 03:54.009
If it's this the quiet
that comes after the storm or...

03:55.580 --> 03:56.706
or the one before it.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.884
Isn't your Mom coming tomorrow?

04:01.240 --> 04:02.275
Could be both.

04:05.540 --> 04:07.588
_ that the storm
Isn't gonna pass.

Now, the only quiet
we can rightfully expect

04:11.940 --> 04:13.066
is up to us.

04:13.730 --> 04:15.243
And the moments we choose.

04:17.380 --> 04:18.506
Like right now?

04:19.520 --> 04:20.942

04:39.190 --> 04:40.487
BILL [over phone]:
You sure about that?

04:40.540 --> 04:42.576
There's plenty more days
till the ballot box.

04:42.970 --> 04:44.835
You might wanna
keep that powder dry.

04:44.890 --> 04:47.188
I was under the impression that
Sheriff Hollister never rested

04:47.240 --> 04:49.492
when the safety
of LA County was at stake.

04:49.550 --> 04:51.586
Don't get all sanctimonious
on me, Jerry.

Your face might get stuck
that way.

West Hollywood City Council

05:06.210 --> 05:08.258
I'll meet you at the hall,

My, you better get
your slicker, cowboy.

05:14.090 --> 05:15.523
I sense a storm coming.

05:17.960 --> 05:20.224
Let's get back
to that quiet moment.

05:31.500 --> 05:33.229
Why'd you send home
the responding deputies?

05:33.280 --> 05:35.328
I thought this was
a pressing issue.

05:35.370 --> 05:37.065
They filed their report.

05:37.110 --> 05:39.328
I was hoping we could handle
the rest discreetly.

05:39.380 --> 05:40.938
And why would we do that?

05:40.990 --> 05:43.072
Bill, these people
are influential,

05:43.120 --> 05:44.462
not just in the community.

05:44.860 --> 05:46.509
We need to be respectful
of their privacy.

05:46.560 --> 05:47.902
And I'm sure
it has nothing to do

05:47.950 --> 05:50.077

campaign pockets, right?

05:50.130 --> 05:51.813
Not my pockets. Ours.

West Hollywood is

lied to me.

-You told me you were a woman.

06:58.630 --> 07:01.758
And now I hear
that's not the whole truth.

07:01.810 --> 07:03.971
Actually you assumed
I was a woman,

07:04.030 --> 07:05.986
and in what should
come as no surprise,

07:06.030 --> 07:08.066
I'm a little more
complicated than that.

Look, Gen...

finally living my truth.

I do.

07:30.010 --> 07:30.829
I just feel like I don't know
who you are anymore.

07:34.230 --> 07:36.403
I'm the same person
you fell in love with.

07:37.320 --> 07:38.628
I haven't changed.

07:39.320 --> 07:42.062
I'm still me. I'm just
a clearer version of me.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.047
Just because they stuck
to West Hollywood

08:09.090 --> 08:11.479
doesn't mean they
won't try new territory.

needs to be on alert.

11:03.400 --> 11:05.652
Can't be a lot of operators
willing to risk that drive.

11:06.440 --> 11:07.873
Outsiders are taking
a huge gamble

11:07.920 --> 11:09.137
in a community like this.

11:09.190 --> 11:10.578
Hey, it must have been
worth it though.

11:10.620 --> 11:11.666
Look at what they took.

11:13.190 --> 11:14.794
Had the homeowner compile a list
of everything they stole.

11:15.150 --> 11:17.368
Bunch of electronics,
jewelry...

11:17.670 --> 11:18.659
They took a gun.

11:25.590 --> 11:26.716
[Cade laughs]

11:26.770 --> 11:28.021
Is it supposed to
sound like that?

11:28.070 --> 11:29.856
I call it "galloping horses."

11:29.900 --> 11:30.855
It's a good thing.

11:30.900 --> 11:32.379
Good. See, we're doing good.

11:34.650 --> 11:36.424
-[keyboard keys clack]

11:36.470 --> 11:38.859
You've have a healthy kid
in there.

11:40.740 --> 11:42.514
I'll see you
in a few weeks, okay?

11:42.570 --> 11:43.730
Okay. Thank you.

11:46.270 --> 11:48.522
-[sighs in relief]
-Hey.

11:48.570 --> 11:50.356
You heard her. Healthy kid.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.174
We couldn't ask
for a better report.

11:52.230 --> 11:53.652
No, 1-1 know. It's just...

11:53.710 --> 11:55.359
Oh, God, everything
that we've been through,

11:55.410 --> 11:56.707
I want it to stay that way.

11:57.410 --> 11:58.445
I know.

11:58.840 --> 12:00.796
Me too.
We got this, okay?

12:02.110 --> 12:03.327
It's gonna be fine.

12:05.150 --> 12:06.492
I can't wait to show the kids.

12:06.550 --> 12:08.768
CADE [chuckles]:
I'm showing everybody.

12:09.680 --> 12:10.726
[chuckles]

12:11.860 --> 12:13.634
He's got his momma's nose.

12:14.420 --> 12:15.466
How do you know it's a he?

12:15.510 --> 12:17.159
That ain't no leg, pal.

12:17.210 --> 12:18.723
[laughs]

12:18.780 --> 12:20.429
No, he, she, doesn't matter.

12:20.470 --> 12:22.734
Doctor said the word, "healthy,"
that's all I care about.

12:22.780 --> 12:25.032
-Congratulations, brother.
-Thanks.

12:25.090 --> 12:26.773
So I heard you on the news
on the way in.

12:26.830 --> 12:28.525
What's popping off
in West Hollywood?

12:28.570 --> 12:31.744
Series of residential
burglaries, high-end.

12:31.790 --> 12:33.564
But last night
they stepped it up.

12:35.230 --> 12:36.390
Homeowner's a mess.

12:36.450 --> 12:38.259
City council wants it
solved quick.

12:39.880 --> 12:41.791
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what's London
got to do with it?

12:42.540 --> 12:43.757
He called in a favor.

12:45.280 --> 12:46.406
He's gunning for your job
and you're doing him favors?

12:46.940 --> 12:48.271
I keep my word.

12:50.500 --> 12:51.899
How can I help?

12:51.940 --> 12:53.760
Talk to the homeowner,
see what you can learn.

12:54.290 --> 12:57.635
Also, they seem very familiar
with the home security systems.

12:57.680 --> 12:59.022
Could be a lead there.

12:59.080 --> 13:01.685
I'm not really a computer guy.
You know that.

13:01.730 --> 13:03.209
Well, use Bishop.

13:03.260 --> 13:04.818
This is right up her alley.

13:04.870 --> 13:06.258
Keep me posted, all right?

13:06.300 --> 13:07.608
All right. Will do.

13:07.650 --> 13:08.901
See you, Dad.

13:08.960 --> 13:10.257
[Cade laughs]

13:22.490 --> 13:24.048
CADE: No time for
training wheels. You're up.

13:24.100 --> 13:25.965
BISHOP:
What do you need?

13:26.020 --> 13:27.669
Your brain on these
West Hollywood burglaries.

13:27.710 --> 13:28.972
They're getting around
the home security.

13:29.020 --> 13:31.068
-I need you to figure out how.
-All right.

13:31.110 --> 13:33.419
Most of these cloud-based
systems have a back door

13:33.460 --> 13:34.415
for law enforcement.

13:34.460 --> 13:35.711
I'll make some calls.

13:35.770 --> 13:37.283
All right. Hit me up
when you find something.

13:37.330 --> 13:38.376
Copy.

13:46.470 --> 13:49.860
You really think they're pawning
$20,000 watches here?

13:50.170 --> 13:51.865
Well, they're not gonna put 'em
in the front window.

13:53.220 --> 13:54.437
So they're fencing, too.

13:54.480 --> 13:55.697
Keep up, boot.

13:56.220 --> 13:57.699
[indistinct
police radio chatter]

14:07.620 --> 14:09.576
What a coincidence.

14:09.630 --> 14:11.495
Everything's half off today.

14:12.020 --> 14:13.453
Law enforcement special.

14:13.500 --> 14:14.888
What a coincidence.

14:14.940 --> 14:16.714
Half your inventory is hot.

14:17.680 --> 14:18.977
You seen any of these?

14:19.770 --> 14:20.930
Can't say I have.

14:20.990 --> 14:23.333
You didn't really do
a thorough check.

14:23.380 --> 14:25.632
MINNICK: Don't make me
pull your slips, Sally.

14:25.690 --> 14:28.648
I'd hate to see your license
hit a snag with renewal.

14:29.390 --> 14:30.425
[sighs]

14:32.390 --> 14:34.426
[scoffs] If these
came through here,

14:34.480 --> 14:36.948
shop'd be closed
and I'd be in Vegas.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.865
All right, what about
any other shops?

14:40.090 --> 14:41.523
I'll make some calls for you

14:41.570 --> 14:43.618
but I doubt
someone outside my network

14:43.660 --> 14:45.708
is trying to move those
without me knowing.

14:45.750 --> 14:47.570
Okay, well, if you
hear something,

14:47.620 --> 14:49.053
you give me a call me.

14:49.620 --> 14:51.269
Especially if
that gun shows up.

14:51.760 --> 14:52.920
Will do, Deputy.

14:58.890 --> 15:00.539
WOMAN: They just came in
like they owned the place.

15:00.590 --> 15:02.148
What was mine was theirs.

15:02.810 --> 15:04.323
I'm sorry you had
to go through that.

15:05.510 --> 15:06.545
How you holdin' up?

15:07.290 --> 15:08.461
I can't sleep.

15:09.080 --> 15:10.115
I can't be here.

15:11.430 --> 15:13.159
I'm gonna go visit my parents
on the East Coast

15:13.210 --> 15:14.290
after we're done here.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.553
I don't know if I'll come back.

15:16.610 --> 15:18.419
They wanna take
your power away.

15:18.960 --> 15:19.949
Don't let 'em.

15:22.050 --> 15:23.563
[voice breaking]:
I was so scared.

15:24.350 --> 15:26.875
When you hear about
people being tied up

15:26.920 --> 15:29.002
or hurt inside their own home

15:29.050 --> 15:31.052
and you wonder
what they went through

15:31.100 --> 15:32.488
in their final minutes.

15:33.490 --> 15:35.048
Hey, you're safe now.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.409
And you have a chance
to stop this from happening

15:37.450 --> 15:38.621
to somebody else.

15:39.630 --> 15:41.018
And I need your help to do that.

15:42.110 --> 15:44.237
-Anything you need.
-CADE: Okay.

15:45.110 --> 15:47.499
The last two houses they hit,
nobody was home,

15:48.420 --> 15:49.978
that's usually planned,
obviously,

15:50.030 --> 15:51.941
but did they ring your bell

15:51.990 --> 15:53.946
or do anything
before they came in?

15:53.990 --> 15:55.241
No.

15:55.300 --> 15:56.426
Nothing like that.

15:57.390 --> 15:58.550
By the time I heard 'em,

15:58.600 --> 16:00.079
they were already
inside the house.

16:00.130 --> 16:02.121
Are you normally at home
on a night like last night?

16:03.040 --> 16:04.041
WOMAN: No.

16:05.570 --> 16:06.605
Wait.

16:07.090 --> 16:08.603
Are you saying that

16:08.660 --> 16:10.173
they would have
been watching me?

16:12.790 --> 16:13.836
[door opens]

16:15.320 --> 16:16.662
Thank you, Sonya.

16:17.580 --> 16:19.798

Thanks for seeing us.

16:19.840 --> 16:21.489
Mayor. Council Member.

16:21.800 --> 16:23.495
This meeting's long overdue.

16:24.150 --> 16:26.675
Well, your predecessor
made time to visit us.

16:26.720 --> 16:28.893
Well, he's not
around anymore, is he?

16:29.510 --> 16:31.319
Bradford and I,
we had our differences,

16:31.380 --> 16:32.984
but I respected him.

16:33.730 --> 16:36.028
I sure as hell
respect this job,

16:36.080 --> 16:38.071
now that I've had
my time in the barrel.

16:38.120 --> 16:39.599
Speaking of which,

16:39.650 --> 16:41.424
I hear you all might be...

16:41.950 --> 16:43.906
seeking other arrangements.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.382
Who told you that?

16:46.440 --> 16:49.125
Oh, come on, we all know
exactly who told him that.

16:49.180 --> 16:51.307
Jerry London asked
for our endorsement

16:51.350 --> 16:53.215
before Bradford
was even in the ground.

16:54.570 --> 16:56.709
-So I take it
you didn't offer.
-MAYOR: No.

16:56.750 --> 16:59.833
And that's why we're gonna put
our support and our money

16:59.880 --> 17:01.359
behind the
Sheriff Hollister candidacy.

17:01.410 --> 17:02.798
Oh, slow down now.

17:03.630 --> 17:05.052
I_haven't even
said I'm running.

17:05.110 --> 17:07.453
Well, let your constituents
convince you.

17:07.500 --> 17:09.491
Talk to some of
our community actIVIsts.

Stay calm, ma'am.

17:17.600 --> 17:19.249
I see you're calling
from 2416 Wonderland,

17:19.290 --> 17:20.598
is that correct?

17:20.640 --> 17:22.335

-[cell phone beeps]
-What's the good word?

17:56.900 --> 17:59.368
They're documenting their
break-ins. Taking pictures.

17:59.420 --> 18:03.720
So I ran a keyword search
of Flocking, Licks, Come Ups,

18:03.770 --> 18:06.079
residential burgs
and home invasion lingo.

18:06.600 --> 18:07.942
What I found isn't good.

18:07.990 --> 18:10.129
They've got a spam page
detailing their crimes.

18:10.170 --> 18:11.728
Well done, Bishop.

18:11.780 --> 18:13.771
Now send me what you found.

18:21.440 --> 18:22.748
People are following this?

18:22.790 --> 18:24.746
BISHOP:
I think it's more than that.

18:24.790 --> 18:26.792
I found another account
posting pictures, too.

Okay, you're getting intense.

I can't help it.

All right. Tell me...
Tell me about your court.

Can we talk about
something else?

19:36.210 --> 19:37.347
CADE: Hey.

19:37.390 --> 19:38.812
The break-in crew
in West Hollywood

19:38.870 --> 19:40.906
is competing with
another group in Bakersfield.

19:40.960 --> 19:42.689
And they're posting evidence
the entire way.

19:42.740 --> 19:44.048
Can you track 'em?

19:44.090 --> 19:45.694
No, I can't get up
on their tech.

19:45.740 --> 19:48.004
They're using a laptop
with ISP masking.

19:48.050 --> 19:49.699
And they're brazen,
millennial tech types,

19:49.750 --> 19:51.786
educated, but not
hardened crooks.

19:51.840 --> 19:54.741
Well, if they were smart,
they'd mix things up a bit.

19:55.410 --> 19:56.923
Hit a different neighborhood.

19:56.970 --> 19:58.790
Yeah, that might jeopardize
their canvass strategy.

19:58.840 --> 20:00.489
You know, they found a way
to blend in.

20:00.540 --> 20:02.269
This is bigger
than we thought, too.

20:02.810 --> 20:04.368
It's two groups
competing at once,

20:04.420 --> 20:05.899
but I've got at least 11 teams

20:05.940 --> 20:08.067
from California, Nevada,
and Arizona

20:08.110 --> 20:09.987
actively looting
over the last year.

20:10.030 --> 20:12.157
Well, if they've got resources,
that would explain

20:12.210 --> 20:14.462
why they haven't pawned
any of the items they stole.

20:14.510 --> 20:15.909
They don't need to.

20:15.950 --> 20:17.941
No, their reward
is bragging rights.

20:17.990 --> 20:19.867
Who gets more
"likes" and "follows."

20:19.910 --> 20:22.128
That's the competition
that's driving them.

20:22.170 --> 20:23.250
Problem with competition

20:23.300 --> 20:24.995
is things start to
get out of hand.

20:25.870 --> 20:28.259
Egos get in the way,
crimes escalate.

20:28.310 --> 20:31.222
It's only a matter of time
before someone uses that gun.

20:31.960 --> 20:33.609
We need an ID now, Bishop.

20:33.660 --> 20:34.740
On it, sir.

20:36.450 --> 20:38.577
West Hollywood has
always prided itself

20:38.620 --> 20:40.144
on being welcoming
to everyone,

20:40.190 --> 20:42.317
let's extend that
to Sheriff Hollister.

20:43.720 --> 20:45.199
Thank you.

20:45.240 --> 20:46.753
I'm not one for stump speeches.

20:46.810 --> 20:49.677
So, I'd just like to say
that my department is proud

20:49.720 --> 20:50.846
to serve West Hollywood.

20:52.380 --> 20:54.336
Now, it's been brought to
my attention that past sheriffs,

20:54.940 --> 20:56.373
who shall remain nameless,

20:57.030 --> 20:58.816
have avoided public scrutiny.

20:58.860 --> 21:00.851
So if any of you have
any questions,

21:00.910 --> 21:01.945
now's your chance.

21:02.650 --> 21:03.605
Sheriff.

21:03.650 --> 21:04.947
Zoe Janeczko here.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.217
Neighborhood watch commander.

21:07.090 --> 21:08.603
What can we do to stop
the home invaders

21:08.650 --> 21:10.083
that are terrorizing
the community?

21:10.130 --> 21:11.392
Why have they not been caught?

21:11.440 --> 21:13.305
Our tax dollars pay your salary,

21:13.350 --> 21:14.783
which is not small.

21:14.830 --> 21:15.876
I looked it up.

21:17.450 --> 21:20.317
Well, Zoe, first of all,
thank you for your service.

21:20.360 --> 21:21.873
At this very moment,

21:21.930 --> 21:24.626
we are out in force
setting up check pomts.

21:24.670 --> 21:27.400
And trust that more than
your fair share of resources

21:27.460 --> 21:29.360
will be put toward
solving these crimes.

21:30.370 --> 21:33.897
But we need to think beyond
the scope of our daily lives.

21:34.420 --> 21:37.196
It's just as important
that the Sheriff's Department

21:37.250 --> 21:40.151
establish relationships
in communities

21:40.210 --> 21:42.337
that don't have
money and influence.

21:42.990 --> 21:46.426
Likewise, folks of
higher financial status

21:46.470 --> 21:47.869
need to understand

21:48.690 --> 21:52.217
that not everyone in a uniform
works for them personally.

21:53.090 --> 21:54.250
Trust is earned.

21:54.790 --> 21:56.348
And I will always
work for yours.

21:56.400 --> 21:58.300
I hope you feel the same way.

22:00.530 --> 22:01.747
Any other questions?

22:04.010 --> 22:07.059
Thank you, Sheriff Hollister.
We are luclq to have you.

22:07.100 --> 22:08.920
-Well, that was easy.
-[laughter]

22:08.970 --> 22:10.710
Thanks, everyone.
Appreciate it.

22:11.540 --> 22:12.586
MAYOR: Bill.

22:13.070 --> 22:14.321
You handled that well.

22:14.760 --> 22:16.933
-Thanks, Mayor.
-Hollister.

22:16.980 --> 22:19.198
You and I both know
you're the man for the job.

22:20.250 --> 22:21.729
Listen, if you decide
to jump in,

22:21.770 --> 22:23.988
you have our support.
I hope you do.

22:24.900 --> 22:25.946
Thank you, Mayor.

22:26.560 --> 22:27.595
Thank you.

22:31.740 --> 22:33.082

-[cell phone buzzing]

22:38.400 --> 22:39.389
You need to get that?

22:39.440 --> 22:40.919
No. Uh, it's okay.

22:42.310 --> 22:43.709
A little trouble
on the home front?

22:43.750 --> 22:46.389
[sighs]
You could say that.

22:46.930 --> 22:48.875
Word of advice,
get ahead of it.

22:48.930 --> 22:50.625
It's harder to stop something

22:50.670 --> 22:52.888
that's been going downhill
for too long, trust me.

22:52.930 --> 22:54.409
Believe me,
I've been trying to.

22:54.460 --> 22:56.064
She won't let me.

22:56.110 --> 22:57.543
Genevieve, right?

22:58.460 --> 23:00.416
Didn't you move from DC
for this girl?

23:00.460 --> 23:01.893
Yeah.

23:02.810 --> 23:04.766
She's probably worth
more than, "trying to."

23:06.550 --> 23:07.630
[monitor beeps]

23:09.430 --> 23:11.557
-We got 'em.
-[keyboard keys clacking]

23:11.600 --> 23:13.204
See, the part
I still don't understand

23:13.260 --> 23:16.514
is how they manage to avoid
the interior cameras long enough

23:16.560 --> 23:17.731
to unplug the Wi-Fi.

23:19.180 --> 23:20.738
That'd be really difficult
to case from the street.

23:22.480 --> 23:23.959
It's 'cause they weren't
on the street.

23:25.220 --> 23:26.653
They've been
in these houses before.

23:49.160 --> 23:50.468
MAN:
You got the router, right?

23:50.510 --> 23:51.989
WOMAN: What are you...
You!

23:52.030 --> 23:53.463
Shane, what are
you doing here?

23:53.510 --> 23:54.909
MASKED MAN:
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

23:54.950 --> 23:56.383
WOMAN:
I'm calling your parents.

23:56.430 --> 23:58.478
SHANE: Put your phone down.
Put your phone down!

24:00.130 --> 24:01.779
MASKED MAN:
What did you just do?

24:03.000 --> 24:04.956
What do you expect me to do?
She saw my face!

24:05.000 --> 24:06.649
MASKED MAN: Yeah, but we're not
supposed to hurt anybody.

24:06.700 --> 24:07.917
Come on, come on,
let's go, let's go!

24:07.960 --> 24:09.916
What are you waiting for?
Let's go!

24:15.540 --> 24:17.144
MINNICK:
GSW to the abdomen.

24:17.190 --> 24:18.703
Looks like
they got interrupted.

24:19.320 --> 24:21.276
Shell casings match
the stolen gun.

24:22.190 --> 24:23.532
CADE:
There's no turning back now.

24:23.590 --> 24:25.148
These guys are driven by ego

24:25.200 --> 24:26.280
and once they become shooters,

24:26.330 --> 24:27.319
all bets are off.

24:27.370 --> 24:29.281
It's about_
self-preservation.

24:29.330 --> 24:30.547
Wi-Fi is still up.

24:30.590 --> 24:31.852
We should have him
on the camera.

24:35.120 --> 24:36.371
[buzzes]

24:37.820 --> 24:39.162
Hey. How can I help?

24:39.210 --> 24:40.768
Hey, what do you need
from me to ID a system

24:40.820 --> 24:42.469
so we can get through
on that backdoor?

24:43.220 --> 24:45.165
Take a picture of the back
of the router and send it to me.

24:45.220 --> 24:46.517
Copy.

24:47.870 --> 24:49.474
How'd they get through
the checkpoint?

24:49.530 --> 24:51.657
I thought the only people
allowed in were locals.

24:53.970 --> 24:56.268
It's probably 'cause they live
in the neighborhood.

25:24.080 --> 25:25.479
Hey, I got a face.

25:25.520 --> 25:27.772
It looks like
the shooter is a teenager.

25:27.830 --> 25:29.957
Perfect.
Coclq and impulsive kid.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.820
This could get a lot worse
before it gets better.

25:31.870 --> 25:34.612
You need to ID that kid
and his partner now.

25:37.400 --> 25:40.005
BILL: Your burglars
are wealthy teenagers

25:40.060 --> 25:42.870
who just shot
one of their own neighbors.

25:43.670 --> 25:46.184
We know Shane Kelley
was the shooter.

25:46.240 --> 25:48.754
And based on _social media
comparisons,

25:48.800 --> 25:51.542
we're pretty sure that's
his partner, Brendan Mitchell.

25:52.420 --> 25:53.580
I know Brendan.

25:55.420 --> 25:56.808
His father is a partner
at one of the biggest law firms
in the county.

25:56.850 --> 25:58.249
This is a good family, Bill.

25:58.290 --> 25:59.541
Maybe someone
put them up to it.

25:59.600 --> 26:00.726
"Put them up to it"?

26:00.770 --> 26:02.556
They didn't steal
a six-pack, Jerry.

26:03.080 --> 26:04.900
We're talking about
a home invasion.

26:04.950 --> 26:06.258
Attempted murder.

26:06.300 --> 26:07.949
I'm not saying Shane
shouldn't be arrested,

26:08.000 --> 26:09.604
I'm just saying maybe there's
a deal to be cut with Brendan.

26:09.650 --> 26:11.470
He's got his whole life
ahead of him.

26:11.960 --> 26:14.178
Give his parents a chance
to correct his behavior.

26:14.220 --> 26:16.825
If these weren't the kids
of prospective donors,

26:16.870 --> 26:18.565
would you be
going easy on 'em?

26:20.100 --> 26:22.307
We are the people
who draw the line, Jerry.

26:23.010 --> 26:25.319
If we don't enforce
the laws for everyone,

26:25.930 --> 26:27.613
what's the damn point?

Why did you have to
shoot her, man?

26:53.780 --> 26:54.997
Your dad will get us off.

26:56.040 --> 26:58.258
-It was an accident!
-Are you high?

26:58.310 --> 26:59.789
You pulled out the gun,
you aimed it at her,

26:59.830 --> 27:00.876
and you pulled the trigger.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.433
-They can't touch us.
-Really?

27:02.490 --> 27:04.048
Because they're
outside_ this house.
It is over!

27:04.100 --> 27:05.829
I'm not giving up
and neither are you!

Why didn't you wake me?

29:48.000 --> 29:49.956
It thought you needed
the rest, honey.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.082
Yeah, I haven't been
sleeping right lately.

29:52.660 --> 29:55.003
I even found Bill on the sofa
a couple of nights

29:55.050 --> 29:56.870
because of my tossing
and turning.

29:58.360 --> 30:01.056
Tell me, what are your, uh,
nightmares about?

30:01.750 --> 30:02.876
Mommy.

30:02.930 --> 30:04.704
I didn't say I was
having nightmares.

30:04.750 --> 30:06.706
I said that I wasn't
sleeping right.

You're allowed
to be affected, mi vida.

Everything is fine.

You know what?

30:16.720 --> 30:18.984
Do you know what I was
before being a mother?

30:19.030 --> 30:20.372
A woman.

30:20.420 --> 30:22.638
Okay? And I can see it
in your eyes, baby,

30:22.690 --> 30:23.987
that not everything is okay.

30:25.820 --> 30:28.516
You can lie to your patients,
lie your friends.

30:28.560 --> 30:30.380
Hell, you can even
lie to Bill, but...

30:31.170 --> 30:32.250
I birthed you, okay?

30:32.300 --> 30:33.995
And I'm waiting for you

30:34.570 --> 30:36.083
to be honest with me.

30:39.400 --> 30:40.389
What do you want me to say?

30:40.440 --> 30:41.919
That I can't sleep at night

30:41.970 --> 30:43.301
because I'm worried
about my husband?

30:43.360 --> 30:45.009
Or that I'm trying to be
strong for my daughter,

30:45.060 --> 30:47.620
when right now I don't even know
ifI could be strong for myself.

30:48.620 --> 30:49.882
Yes.

30:49.930 --> 30:52.103
Because you're being
honest, baby, okay?

30:52.150 --> 30:53.970
And it makes you realize
you're a human being,

30:54.020 --> 30:55.453
and it's okay to be afraid.

30:56.370 --> 30:57.928
Just know that I'm here for you.

been there for me, always.

been around the last few months

has changed around here.

I know. My little baby's
not a baby anymore.

31:22.140 --> 31:23.175
I know.

31:24.270 --> 31:26.170
I'm surprised
that the sheriff is okay

31:26.230 --> 31:27.788
with her having a boyfriend.

-[camera shutters clicking]

31:49.510 --> 31:53.207
Today, LA Sheriff's Deputies
arrested two suspects

31:53.250 --> 31:55.810
tied to the recent string
of home invasions

31:55.870 --> 31:57.553
in the hills of West Hollywood.

31:58.170 --> 31:59.603
One suspect was shot.

31:59.650 --> 32:01.470
He was taken to
UCLA Medical Center,

32:01.520 --> 32:03.078
where he'll undergo surgery.

32:04.400 --> 32:06.391
Some people rob
out of desperation.

32:06.960 --> 32:08.222
Some to feed their habit.

32:09.180 --> 32:12.525
These kids in particular
had money and status.

32:12.580 --> 32:15.140
Yet still,
a hole grew inside of them.

32:15.670 --> 32:18.059
When people who have the most,
care the least...

32:18.980 --> 32:20.231
well, that's a bigger problem.

32:20.890 --> 32:22.278
One that we can't solve.

32:22.810 --> 32:24.584
So it's everybody's
responsibility

32:24.630 --> 32:27.019
to teach our children
what all this means.

32:27.850 --> 32:29.021
And that we're in it together.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.649
I had a really good first day.

33:27.090 --> 33:29.911
It can't always be on your time
and on your terms.

33:30.660 --> 33:33.003
Okay, well, I would
like it to be on our terms.

33:33.050 --> 33:35.359
But things have been
a little bit chaotic lately.

33:36.270 --> 33:38.044
This is exactly why
I didn't tell you sooner.

33:38.100 --> 33:40.056
I was afraid of things
turning out like this.

33:40.100 --> 33:41.180
I'm a lesbian.

33:42.100 --> 33:43.795
A woman who likes women.

33:44.670 --> 33:47.537
And if you're not a woman,
what does that mean for me?

33:48.020 --> 33:49.191
For us?

33:49.810 --> 33:51.880
Well, I can't tell you
what that means for you,

33:51.940 --> 33:55.023
but for us, I know that I
have to bring my whole self

33:55.070 --> 33:56.503
to this relationship.

34:00.210 --> 34:01.598
Where are you going?

34:01.640 --> 34:04.108
Calling a ride.
I'm going home.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.002
Quite a stunt
you pulled, Sheriff.

34:16.050 --> 34:18.223
I wanna be up-front with you.

34:18.920 --> 34:20.000
About what, now?

34:20.400 --> 34:21.651
I talked to your friends

34:21.710 --> 34:23.666
over at the West Hollywood
City Council.

34:23.710 --> 34:24.961
And?

34:25.010 --> 34:26.352
They never
had any intention

34:26.410 --> 34:28.059
of shopping out
our contract.

34:28.970 --> 34:31.052
They just told you that
to keep you in check.

34:33.150 --> 34:36.062
There is one candidate they seem
very excited about, though.

34:36.110 --> 34:37.327
[scoffs]

34:37.370 --> 34:39.372
So, you're running now?

34:40.510 --> 34:43.070
Nothing's ever completely
off the table, Jerry.

34:44.160 --> 34:45.502
Good night.

34:50.300 --> 34:51.471
Pull!

34:51.520 --> 34:53.511
[hip hop music playing]

34:56.350 --> 34:57.738
-Damn, man.
-[laughing]

34:58.440 --> 34:59.520
Drink, bitch.

35:03.570 --> 35:05.913
I think it's safe to say
that after today,

35:05.970 --> 35:08.928
there's no way
Minnick can tank your evals.

35:09.620 --> 35:11.838
Ugh.
Oh, God.

35:11.890 --> 35:13.312
Yeah, but I still wouldn't
put it past her.

35:14.720 --> 35:15.846
Dude, you saved her life.

35:15.890 --> 35:17.755
She would've done
the same for me.

35:20.330 --> 35:21.376
Okay.

35:23.160 --> 35:24.764
So what's up with you
and that girl?

35:24.810 --> 35:26.596
-You guys good?
-It didn't really work out.

35:27.340 --> 35:28.329
Yeah.

35:28.380 --> 35:29.631
She wanted me to lock it down.

35:30.380 --> 35:32.428
But, you know,
I can't be tamed.

35:34.560 --> 35:36.084
Man, you are so cold for that.

35:36.130 --> 35:37.347
Oh, come on, man.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.390
You really imagine me
w-with a wife

35:41.440 --> 35:43.522
and a couple of rug rats
running around?

35:45.310 --> 35:46.356
What about you?

35:47.100 --> 35:48.749
Nah. Nah, I'm good.

35:48.790 --> 35:49.870
Oh, please.

35:49.930 --> 35:51.181
What, man?
I'm serious, man.

35:51.230 --> 35:53.050
I-I don't have time
for a relationship.

35:53.100 --> 35:54.317
Is that right?

35:54.360 --> 35:55.839
You mean to tell me
there's not even anyone

35:55.890 --> 35:56.970
on your radar right now?

36:02.240 --> 36:04.845
There's no one
in the picture, but...

36:06.810 --> 36:08.459
I may have somebody in mind.

36:11.950 --> 36:13.724
LONDON:
Where did you find this?

36:13.780 --> 36:15.680
I'd rather not reveal
my sources.

36:16.260 --> 36:18.205
But I can assure you
every piece of information

36:18.260 --> 36:19.295
has been confirmed.

36:20.040 --> 36:21.996
I truly appreciate
your efforts.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.388
MINNICK: IfI may...

36:24.440 --> 36:26.044
It's my understanding
Sheriff Hollister

36:26.090 --> 36:27.955
has no plans of running
for reelection.

36:28.010 --> 36:30.478
I don't see how anything
in that file can be of use.

36:31.620 --> 36:33.520
I_ consider this_
my insurance policy.

36:34.800 --> 36:36.006
Thank you, Deputy Minnick.

36:53.120 --> 36:54.155
Cade.

36:54.820 --> 36:56.162
What happened?
What's wrong?

36:56.210 --> 36:58.462
Roberto and Camilla's
soaal worker called.

36:58.520 --> 37:00.511
Their grandmother
contacted DCFS.

37:00.560 --> 37:01.515
Grandmother?

37:01.560 --> 37:02.948
Yeah, she wants to see them.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.605
I contacted a friend
in family law, Ijust...

37:05.650 --> 37:07.561
We gotta...
We gotta protect the kids.

37:07.610 --> 37:09.043
We just got them settled.

37:09.090 --> 37:10.694
Hey, it's okay, it's okay.
It's okay, all right?

37:10.750 --> 37:12.911
We're gonna figure it out.
Don't worry.

37:24.150 --> 37:25.583
Did you know
when you moved here

37:25.630 --> 37:27.188
that you were non-binary?

37:28.330 --> 37:29.752
I didn't have a term for it

37:29.810 --> 37:32.062
but I knew that something
about me was different.

37:33.510 --> 37:35.546
But that doesn't change
how I feel about you.

37:36.340 --> 37:37.898
I know we can get through this.

37:42.300 --> 37:43.642
But you don't.

37:43.690 --> 37:45.294
I don't know ifI can...

37:46.130 --> 37:47.165
[sighs]

37:49.520 --> 37:50.999
-Pu|| over.
-DRIVER: Are you sure?

37:51.050 --> 37:53.177
-We're on the freeway.
-I will not do this anymore.

37:53.220 --> 37:54.266
Pull over!

37:59.750 --> 38:01.263
Just so that we're clear...

38:02.060 --> 38:03.311
I wanted your acceptance,

38:03.360 --> 38:06.011
but I did not need
your acceptance.

38:06.060 --> 38:08.790
You promised the world
and I fell for it

38:10.810 --> 38:13.017
I put you first
and you adored it

38:13.070 --> 38:16.289
Set fires to my forest

38:16.330 --> 38:17.638
And you let it burn

38:17.680 --> 38:20.945
Sang off-key in my chorus

38:20.990 --> 38:22.548
'Cause it wasn't yours

38:23.560 --> 38:25.118
Yeah

38:25.170 --> 38:29.732
We'd always go
into it blindly

38:29.780 --> 38:34.388
I needed to lose you
to find me

38:34.440 --> 38:37.603
This dance,
it was killing me softly

38:37.660 --> 38:39.264
[screams]

38:39.310 --> 38:43.189
I needed to hate you
to love me, yeah

38:43.230 --> 38:44.959
To love, love, yeah

38:45.010 --> 38:46.659
To love, love, yeah

38:46.710 --> 38:48.359
To love, yeah

38:48.410 --> 38:52.369
I needed to lose you
to love me, yeah

BILL: Hey, Mags.

38:58.290 --> 39:00.633
Hey, Dad.
Mom said you wanted me?

39:00.680 --> 39:01.726
BILL: Yeah.

39:02.470 --> 39:03.459
[sighs]

39:03.510 --> 39:05.023
I need a favor.

39:05.080 --> 39:07.298
This gelding
needs a light touch.

39:07.340 --> 39:08.557
And that ain't me.

39:10.130 --> 39:11.336
You wanna hop on up?

39:20.400 --> 39:22.618
Apply some pressure
to his side, will ya?

39:23.620 --> 39:25.963
Okay. I've trained
horses before.

39:26.010 --> 39:29.093
I know, I just thought you could
help out your old man.

39:29.800 --> 39:31.620
You know,
when you're training a horse,

39:31.670 --> 39:33.979
what we're really doing
is forming a partnership.

39:34.020 --> 39:35.055
Aren't we?

39:35.500 --> 39:36.660
You're building a trust.

39:37.330 --> 39:38.672
But in order to do that...

39:39.460 --> 39:40.848
You have to have patience.

39:41.720 --> 39:43.415
And if you're not
patient enough...

39:43.460 --> 39:45.280
-You get thrown.
-[cell phone buzzing]

39:45.330 --> 39:46.809
BILL: Exactly.

39:46.860 --> 39:47.895

39:49.470 --> 39:50.505
Yeah.

39:51.650 --> 39:52.685
[Maggie sighs]

39:56.560 --> 39:57.606
And where are you?

40:07.660 --> 40:09.480
[Bishop panting]

40:10.190 --> 40:11.703
What the hell
are you doing, Bishop?

40:13.060 --> 40:14.448
It's over, Sheriff.

40:14.490 --> 40:15.923
The veil has been lifted!

40:16.760 --> 40:18.887
Excuse me, but you're gonna
have to help me out here.

40:21.500 --> 40:22.751
Doc took a look.

40:23.500 --> 40:25.764
Wrote a little _F
on my birth certificate,

40:26.850 --> 40:28.158
and ever since that moment

40:28.200 --> 40:29.633
_the whole world has
Viewed me as a woman.

40:31.030 --> 40:32.076
Well, aren't you?

40:33.210 --> 40:34.552
No. Sheriff, I'm not.

40:35.520 --> 40:37.420
I'm not a woman,
but I'm not a man, either.

40:38.170 --> 40:39.728
Something other than
those two.

40:41.090 --> 40:42.990
My gender is non-binary.

40:43.040 --> 40:44.996
And Genevieve
couldn't accept that.

40:45.050 --> 40:47.132
I... I wasn't
who she thought I was.

40:55.800 --> 40:57.358
I'm not she or her,

40:58.320 --> 40:59.446
or even him,

41:00.410 --> 41:01.445
I'm they and them.

41:02.410 --> 41:03.718
Those are my pronouns.

41:06.240 --> 41:07.582
Well, you know...

41:09.070 --> 41:10.378
that you never
have to be anything

41:10.420 --> 41:11.853
but yourself with me, right?

41:16.730 --> 41:17.765
[Bishop sniffles]

41:23.170 --> 41:24.296
Thank you.

41:24.690 --> 41:25.861
And I'm gonna be honest,

41:25.910 --> 41:27.866
I'm still learning
exactly who I am,

41:27.920 --> 41:28.955
but for now...

41:30.570 --> 41:32.299
I've gotta stop being
who I'm not.

41:35.620 --> 41:37.315
Well, I might
mess up sometimes.

41:38.880 --> 41:39.960
I'll remind you.

41:43.020 --> 41:44.499
Why don't we get off
the freeway, huh?

41:46.930 --> 41:48.670
So what am I
supposed to call you now?

41:49.370 --> 41:51.099
Bishop. Just Bishop.

41:51.900 --> 41:53.151
Just Bishop.

41:54.030 --> 41:55.065
Okay.

42:00.690 --> 42:01.725
[sighs]

42:10.570 --> 42:11.559
So what now?

42:12.740 --> 42:13.991
The world's your oyster.

42:14.960 --> 42:15.949
No masks.

42:16.010 --> 42:17.352
Just Bishop.

42:20.620 --> 42:21.655
Hey.

42:22.620 --> 42:23.700
You live your truth.

42:25.630 --> 42:26.756
End of the day,

42:27.630 --> 42:28.665
it's all we got.

42:32.590 --> 42:33.716
Let me get you home.
