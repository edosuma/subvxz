WEBVTT

00:10.125 --> 00:12.041
Uh-huh.

00:13.291 --> 00:14.750
Been waiting
for you,
baby.

00:14.834 --> 00:16.083
Where you at?

00:18.500 --> 00:20.291
When exactly
you gonna be home?

00:20.375 --> 00:21.959
(Christina on phone)
'I just got a little
hung up, baby.'

00:22.041 --> 00:24.041
I'm on my way
back to the city now.

00:24.125 --> 00:26.834
(male #1 on phone)
'I don't understand what
you been doing all this
time.'

00:26.917 --> 00:29.417
Starting to worry.
You know I hate to worry,
babe.

00:29.500 --> 00:32.041
Oh, no, sweetie.
There's nothing to worry
about.

00:32.125 --> 00:34.792
I just finished setting up
our contacts down here.

00:34.875 --> 00:36.875
"Contacts?"
Like what, your
family?

00:36.959 --> 00:39.375
No, I just lined up
that doc who writes scrips

00:39.458 --> 00:41.750
as long as we kick back
and keep it all in cash.

00:41.834 --> 00:43.583
(male #1 on phone)
'Uh-huh.'

00:43.667 --> 00:45.834
So you're on your way
driving back now?

00:45.917 --> 00:47.875
(Christina)
'Yeah, I'll be back
before sunup.'

00:47.959 --> 00:49.458
Well, that's good, babe

00:49.542 --> 00:52.625
'cause I can't wait
to see your lying ass!

00:53.792 --> 00:54.792
No-no-no!

00:58.333 --> 00:59.959
Who the hell do you
think you're talking to?

01:02.542 --> 01:03.959
Get in here!

01:21.959 --> 01:23.250
'Christina?'

01:32.041 --> 01:33.417
Christina?

03:07.667 --> 03:10.291
- Someone here to see you,
Will.
- Yeah?

03:10.375 --> 03:11.583
Althea Johnson.

03:13.667 --> 03:16.875
Daughter Wanda shot and dumped
in the Badlands back in '93.

03:16.959 --> 03:19.583
Hmm. Banana bread, huh?

03:19.667 --> 03:21.333
17 years this November.

03:21.417 --> 03:24.792
(Will)
'Calls me every year asking
if there's been a break.'

03:24.875 --> 03:26.625
Been hanging these faithfully.

03:27.709 --> 03:29.333
I wish I could tell
you we have a break

03:29.417 --> 03:30.667
in the case, Mrs. Johnson, but..

03:30.750 --> 03:34.125
I got a call
on my flyer,
detective.

03:34.208 --> 03:37.542
Man says he saw Wanda
in a car that night.

03:37.625 --> 03:38.458
Alive.

03:38.542 --> 03:40.375
- Night she was killed?
- Yes.

03:40.458 --> 03:43.959
Green car, just like the one
the other witness said.

03:44.041 --> 03:46.959
- 'Where?'
- Corner of Kip and Cambria.

03:47.041 --> 03:49.375
- That's a bad drug corner.
- I know.

03:49.458 --> 03:52.500
But my Wanda didn't mess
with drugs, detective.

03:52.583 --> 03:53.959
She was a good girl.

03:55.291 --> 03:57.291
You should have done
that homework last
night.

03:57.375 --> 03:58.583
Mama, please.

03:58.667 --> 03:59.834
It's done.

03:59.917 --> 04:01.834
And you didn't
eat
your breakfast.

04:01.917 --> 04:03.333
I got a Pop-Tart.

04:08.041 --> 04:09.792
- Wanda, honey?
- What?

04:09.875 --> 04:11.709
You gonna run barefoot?

04:11.792 --> 04:13.875
- You forgot your track
shoes.
- Bye.

04:13.959 --> 04:15.750
You forgetting
something else?

04:15.834 --> 04:18.500
- Mom?
- You're still my little
girl.

04:22.750 --> 04:24.792
[chuckles]
Hey!

04:30.083 --> 04:34.291
Ten minutes late to pick her up
from practice and she was gone.

04:35.583 --> 04:38.166
This man, he just
happened to see her?

04:38.250 --> 04:39.959
I grilled him good.

04:40.041 --> 04:42.041
I believe
he's telling the truth.

04:42.125 --> 04:43.458
We'll bring him
in.
Check his story.

04:43.542 --> 04:46.917
Calls himself
Brother Olajuwon now.

04:48.250 --> 04:50.333
Says he's turned
his life around.

04:50.417 --> 04:52.625
Oh, one of those.

04:52.709 --> 04:56.583
I'd prefer if you keep
an open mind,
detective.

04:58.375 --> 05:00.583
Hey, Valens, did
you
hear about Mota?

05:00.667 --> 05:02.166
What's that?

05:02.250 --> 05:04.750
Just got Swiss-cheesed in
the shower up in the big
house.

05:06.625 --> 05:08.625
- Really?
- You didn't know about that?

05:10.542 --> 05:11.875
Just now hearing it.

05:11.959 --> 05:14.125
Hmm, just asking 'cause, uh..

05:14.208 --> 05:16.375
...I saw
the visitation logs
and..

05:16.458 --> 05:17.542
you were up there
now two days ago

05:17.625 --> 05:19.375
paying Hector Cruz a visit.

05:19.458 --> 05:23.333
Yeah. Yeah, it's some
other case I'm working.

05:23.417 --> 05:25.792
Something I need to worry about?

05:25.875 --> 05:28.667
Hmm or anybody else
for that matter?

05:28.750 --> 05:30.125
I don't see why.

05:30.208 --> 05:31.875
Hmm.

05:31.959 --> 05:34.917
Couldn't happen
to a nicer guy.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.250
Yeah.

05:37.709 --> 05:40.041
Thanks for the heads-up.

05:43.250 --> 05:44.834
(Lilly)
'Hey, buddy.'

05:44.917 --> 05:47.542
Anybody asking for a Christina
Rush last night, room 48?

05:47.625 --> 05:48.917
I'm sorry, that information

05:49.000 --> 05:52.083
will require a warrant
from a judge or a magistrate.

05:52.166 --> 05:53.500
What?

05:53.583 --> 05:56.583
Under the Fourth Amendment
based on probable cause.

05:56.667 --> 05:58.250
You're gonna require orthodontia

05:58.333 --> 05:59.750
you don't start
answering the right
way.

05:59.834 --> 06:02.291
Christina Rush, 48.

06:02.375 --> 06:04.333
I'm sorry. There's no one
that's checked in or out

06:04.417 --> 06:06.125
this week by that name.

06:06.208 --> 06:07.375
You open up
or I'm gonna put
that

06:07.458 --> 06:08.583
fire extinguisher
through this
window.

06:08.667 --> 06:11.000
Well, that wouldn't
seem prudent.

06:15.166 --> 06:17.625
Do I need to call the police?

06:18.834 --> 06:20.667
Better yet, how
about I call
Vice?

06:20.750 --> 06:24.542
Shut down this fleabag
for narcotics and
prostitution.

06:32.208 --> 06:34.208
Who paid the bill?

06:34.291 --> 06:36.166
(male #2)
'They haven't checked out
yet.'

06:40.500 --> 06:41.834
(male #2)
'What?'

06:44.917 --> 06:47.166
'Are you kidding me?'

06:47.250 --> 06:49.542
"Alexis Childress?"

06:49.625 --> 06:51.291
I was just informed
by housekeeping

06:51.375 --> 06:52.542
that the room is trashed.

06:52.625 --> 06:54.291
The woman in 48,
what did she look like?

06:54.375 --> 06:56.959
Sandy blonde, in her 30s.

06:57.041 --> 06:58.667
Looks a little like you.

06:58.750 --> 07:00.083
You take a credit card
for the deposit?

07:00.166 --> 07:03.667
I waived it on account
of her general hotness.

07:03.750 --> 07:04.875
That and she paid cash.

07:04.959 --> 07:06.458
Anyone else coming
or going from this room?

07:06.542 --> 07:08.834
Just you, and now
the room is trashed.

07:11.750 --> 07:15.166
Hey, who's gonna pay for this?

07:16.750 --> 07:20.291
Don't see that witness
statement
about the car back in '93.

07:20.375 --> 07:21.500
Could've swore it was here.

07:22.333 --> 07:24.000
Inez Kellog, little old lady

07:24.083 --> 07:26.667
got a partial on a green
SUV leaving the dump
site.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.083
Anybody else been in the box?

07:29.750 --> 07:30.834
Not according to the log.

07:30.917 --> 07:32.083
But you remember it?

07:32.166 --> 07:33.417
Yeah, never went anywhere

07:33.500 --> 07:36.000
'cause she couldn't
ID the model or
year.

07:36.083 --> 07:39.208
Well, new info puts
Wanda in a similar car

07:39.291 --> 07:41.125
three blocks from there.

07:41.208 --> 07:43.583
This guy better not
be sowing false
hope.

07:45.083 --> 07:46.583
(Scotty)
'Hey, you alright?'

07:46.667 --> 07:48.125
Yeah, I'm fine.

07:48.208 --> 07:49.542
But Christina's gone.

07:49.625 --> 07:51.375
Along with my service weapon.

07:51.458 --> 07:53.458
Oh, Lil, you've
gotta call this in.

07:53.542 --> 07:55.000
I need your help
getting 'em both
back.

07:55.083 --> 07:56.625
But you don't report it
stolen,
it gets used in a crime.

07:56.709 --> 07:57.834
That's it, Lil. You're done.

07:57.917 --> 08:00.375
Look, I know
what this means, Scotty.

08:00.458 --> 08:02.166
I'm asking for your help.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.417
What do we got?

08:05.500 --> 08:06.709
Well, the guy tossed the room.

08:06.792 --> 08:08.959
He was looking for something.

08:10.291 --> 08:12.625
Oxys. Who's Alexis Childress?

08:12.709 --> 08:14.542
The same name the room's under.

08:14.625 --> 08:16.125
It's all we got to go on.

08:16.208 --> 08:18.959
Uh, you wanna go after
these guys without a gun?

08:19.041 --> 08:21.709
Don't worry. I got a gun.

08:27.500 --> 08:29.500
Robert Miggs?

08:29.583 --> 08:31.750
As-salaam alaikum,

08:31.834 --> 08:33.750
And it's Brother Olajuwon now.

08:33.834 --> 08:35.792
Yeah, only reason
we're meeting like
this

08:35.875 --> 08:37.333
is 'cause of Althea Johnson.

08:37.417 --> 08:39.000
She said I could trust you.

08:39.083 --> 08:40.458
Do you find
the prophet while
doing

08:40.542 --> 08:43.166
that dime up
at Camp Hill,
brother?

08:43.250 --> 08:44.917
Allah had a plan for me.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.834
That plan include
sprouting a
conscience?

08:48.166 --> 08:51.250
The first thing I saw
when I finished my
incarceration

08:51.333 --> 08:54.083
was that woman out there
in a blizzard hanging flyers.

08:54.166 --> 08:56.500
She wanted to find out
what happened to her daughter.

08:56.583 --> 09:01.333
Yeah, well, I saw that girl's
face, and I remembered--

09:01.417 --> 09:02.417
Name's Wanda.

09:02.500 --> 09:03.709
Where'd you see her?

09:03.792 --> 09:06.542
Like Brother Malcolm,
I, too, was in the game.

09:06.625 --> 09:07.542
Dealing.

09:07.625 --> 09:09.291
The corner was poppin'.

09:09.375 --> 09:11.709
As they say
in the pusher parlance.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.250
Wanda trying to cop?

09:15.333 --> 09:17.500
I don't know what
she was doing in that car.

09:17.583 --> 09:19.458
Just knew something
wasn't right.

09:40.458 --> 09:41.959
Yo, check off, Young.

09:43.542 --> 09:44.709
I don't like that one.

09:46.750 --> 09:49.000
There's something
ain't right with that.

09:54.583 --> 09:57.125
Can't get that girl's face
out of my thoughts.

09:57.208 --> 09:59.291
You get a good look at the car?

09:59.375 --> 10:01.375
Green Ford Explorer.

10:01.458 --> 10:02.834
Got a head for cars?

10:02.917 --> 10:04.834
Skill set you get on the corner.

10:04.917 --> 10:06.500
Only way to read your customer.

10:06.583 --> 10:07.792
What'd that car say to you?

10:07.875 --> 10:11.375
Caucasian car.
That's how come I remembered.

10:11.458 --> 10:13.458
Wondered what
a beautiful, young sister

10:13.542 --> 10:15.542
was doing in a ride like that.

10:15.625 --> 10:17.709
You see anybody
in there with
her?

10:17.792 --> 10:20.458
No. Just heard voices.

10:20.542 --> 10:24.542
Some kind of dispute,
then the gun went off.

10:26.959 --> 10:29.750
Different model
years
of Ford Explorer.

10:31.458 --> 10:33.625
Tell me which one you recognize.

10:35.125 --> 10:38.083
- Like that.
- '92.

10:38.166 --> 10:40.125
Ford Explorer. Sure?

10:41.333 --> 10:44.291
Had one of them
"DARE" stickers on it.

10:52.500 --> 10:55.375
Where'd you get that?

10:55.458 --> 10:57.375
It was a gift.

10:57.458 --> 10:59.125
Are you prepared
to use that
thing?

10:59.208 --> 11:00.667
They got my sister.

11:00.750 --> 11:02.834
Assaulted me and took my gun.

11:03.917 --> 11:05.959
Just evening the odds.

11:06.041 --> 11:08.750
We'll start with this
Rothman Drugs doling out

11:08.834 --> 11:11.959
a lifetime supply
of painkillers,
huh?

11:12.041 --> 11:13.917
One hundred count,
160 milligrams.

11:15.208 --> 11:19.000
That's a lot of blues.
Worse than I thought.

11:19.083 --> 11:20.709
What's that mean?

11:21.667 --> 11:24.417
Hmm. Come on, Lil. You saw her.

11:24.500 --> 11:29.250
It's what pill-poppers do,
use fake names to get
scrips.

11:29.333 --> 11:31.041
But why are you so sure
that they're Christina's?

11:31.125 --> 11:34.083
Checked into that fleabag
under the same alias.

11:34.166 --> 11:36.291
He's gotta use a fake name
'cause she can't get a scrip

11:36.375 --> 11:37.917
for a controlled
substance with a
record.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.583
You know, my sister's a lot
of things, but a drug addict?

11:42.959 --> 11:44.625
You know something
I don't, Scotty?

11:44.709 --> 11:45.834
Here we go.

11:45.917 --> 11:48.083
When's the last
time you saw her?

11:48.166 --> 11:50.542
- When was that?
- She called me.

11:52.375 --> 11:54.458
A couple days ago.

11:54.542 --> 11:56.625
Just tell her I'll be
back soon, okay, baby?

11:59.083 --> 12:00.667
Alright, take care.

12:03.458 --> 12:04.709
Hey.

12:07.375 --> 12:08.667
Thanks for coming.

12:11.709 --> 12:16.500
Listen, I know I...left
a mess last time I was in
town.

12:19.166 --> 12:20.458
I'm really sorry about that.

12:24.709 --> 12:26.417
What do you need, Christina?

12:28.667 --> 12:32.083
- Oh, it's like that, huh?
- Yeah, it's like that.

12:32.166 --> 12:34.041
Just get to it.

12:38.417 --> 12:42.083
You're the only one who
really knows my sister.

12:42.166 --> 12:43.625
What she's like,
what she's
thinking.

12:43.709 --> 12:44.875
Uh, I don't know about that.

12:44.959 --> 12:47.792
I wanna know if
she still hates
me.

12:49.750 --> 12:51.625
You're talking to me.

12:51.709 --> 12:53.333
You haven't even spoken
to her yet, have you?

12:58.834 --> 13:00.000
Do you think there's a chance

13:00.083 --> 13:02.667
that Lilly could
ever get past it?

13:02.750 --> 13:04.333
What difference does it make?

13:04.417 --> 13:06.834
- You're just gonna skip
town.
- No.

13:06.917 --> 13:09.041
That's just it.

13:09.125 --> 13:11.250
I wanna move back.

13:11.333 --> 13:13.667
This is my home.
This is where my family is.

13:15.959 --> 13:17.709
I don't know, Christina.

13:19.542 --> 13:21.041
You're gonna have
to call Lilly yourself.

13:22.917 --> 13:26.709
But...you might wanna
get cleaned up first.

13:29.583 --> 13:34.542
I'm trying, Scotty.
I'm really trying.

13:34.625 --> 13:36.959
<i>(Scotty)</i>
<i>I know that look</i>
<i>from narcotics.</i>

13:37.041 --> 13:39.542
<i>pinned.</i>

13:39.625 --> 13:41.333
She was jonesing.

13:43.125 --> 13:45.041
My sister..

13:45.125 --> 13:47.000
...hooked on hillbilly heroin
and you didn't tell me?

13:48.417 --> 13:49.583
What the hell was I
supposed to say, Lil?

13:49.667 --> 13:52.291
After what happened last time?

13:52.375 --> 13:53.709
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

13:53.792 --> 13:54.917
What are you doing?

13:55.041 --> 13:56.417
(Scotty)
'Hey! What are you doing?'

13:56.500 --> 13:58.500
- 'Hey!'
- You lied to my face!

13:58.583 --> 14:00.458
But see? I knew
you'd react this
way.

14:00.542 --> 14:02.166
Why do you think
she
came to me first,
Lil?

14:02.250 --> 14:03.750
Of course, why wouldn't she?

14:03.834 --> 14:06.083
It says a lot about your
relationship, don't it?

14:06.166 --> 14:08.375
You think I wanna get put in
the
middle of this all over again?

14:08.458 --> 14:09.750
It didn't stop you before.

14:09.834 --> 14:12.875
Just another piece
to you right, Scotty?

14:12.959 --> 14:14.458
You know, why don't you
take your ass back up

14:14.542 --> 14:16.417
to the feds
and take that big job?

14:16.500 --> 14:17.500
You can forget
about us just like

14:17.583 --> 14:19.875
you forgot about your sister.

14:19.959 --> 14:21.208
What?

14:23.041 --> 14:26.125
I figured you were
her next stop anyway.

14:26.208 --> 14:27.500
'Was I right?'

14:30.500 --> 14:32.375
Why wouldn't you just tell me?

14:33.875 --> 14:35.750
I don't know, Lil.

14:35.834 --> 14:38.959
Maybe I got my own family
to deal with.

14:39.041 --> 14:40.375
Did you ever think of that?

14:48.667 --> 14:51.792
We just gonna stand
here arguing all damn day?

14:51.875 --> 14:54.542
Or are we gonna go get
your gun and Christina back?

15:04.583 --> 15:06.166
Anybody seen Rush today?

15:06.250 --> 15:07.333
Some family thing
with her sister.

15:07.417 --> 15:08.458
Think Scotty went
to help her out.

15:08.542 --> 15:10.291
Don't even wanna know.

15:10.375 --> 15:12.291
That missing
witness
statement turn up?

15:12.375 --> 15:16.083
Gone. Any luck with the
partial
plates ran back in the day?

15:16.166 --> 15:18.709
I got 40
'92 green Ford Explorers

15:18.792 --> 15:20.250
but none of 'em checked out.

15:20.333 --> 15:23.959
"Wreck, alibi, in for repair,
out of search radius."

15:24.041 --> 15:25.500
What about this one?

15:25.583 --> 15:28.750
Every other one has
a reason why it was
deleted.

15:28.834 --> 15:30.375
Did you farm out
any legwork back in the day?

15:30.458 --> 15:32.041
I was busy
chasing down witnesses

15:32.125 --> 15:35.291
so I used
Joe Mueller in
patrol.

15:37.417 --> 15:38.792
This is fault of patient.

15:38.875 --> 15:41.625
People change numbers,
fax in forged scrips.

15:41.709 --> 15:43.375
Addicts stop at nothing
to get pills.

15:43.458 --> 15:45.917
Ten refills and you don't
even double-check with the doc?

15:46.000 --> 15:47.250
She didn't look like an addict.

15:47.333 --> 15:49.333
Was she alone
or was she working with someone?

15:49.417 --> 15:51.625
- What do you mean?
- It's a lax pharmacy.

15:51.709 --> 15:52.917
That doles out pills like candy.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.500
- Word spreads fast.
- Lies!

15:54.583 --> 15:57.166
You pulled the records.
She was paying cash, right?

15:57.250 --> 15:58.667
You dealing
painkillers
or drug addicts?

15:58.750 --> 16:02.250
I call the DEA,
that's fed time,
Nazir.

16:02.333 --> 16:05.000
(Lilly)
'Look, we're not
interested in busting you.'

16:06.792 --> 16:08.792
We're looking for this woman.

16:08.875 --> 16:11.083
And anyone else
she was working
with.

16:14.542 --> 16:16.208
She came alone.

16:16.291 --> 16:17.667
But she had the same
address on her ID

16:17.750 --> 16:19.583
as the two other
guys from New York.

16:19.667 --> 16:20.667
Which same address?

16:20.750 --> 16:21.709
What other guys?

16:21.792 --> 16:24.583
New York ID.
They paid with cash.

16:27.291 --> 16:29.041
(Lilly)
'How often these guys come in?'

16:29.125 --> 16:30.625
(Nazir)
'First guy's been
in here before.'

16:30.709 --> 16:32.583
'Knows not to come
more than once a week.'

16:32.667 --> 16:34.208
(Scotty)
'Well, what about
this other guy?'

16:34.291 --> 16:36.083
(Nazir)
'Don't recognize him.'

16:36.166 --> 16:39.291
'But this is not the only
place that takes cash.'

16:39.375 --> 16:41.291
(Lilly)
'All using fake New York
IDs.'

16:41.375 --> 16:42.750
And you don't report it.

16:42.834 --> 16:44.875
I'm cooperating with you now.

16:44.959 --> 16:47.041
Pharmacies that play
ball with drug addicts.

16:47.125 --> 16:49.125
Just one stop on the circuit?

16:49.208 --> 16:51.041
Like clockwork.

16:51.125 --> 16:53.834
And I can tell you the place
they're going to hit up next.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.875
- Got a minute, Joe?
- Yeah.

16:59.959 --> 17:01.542
Signed Ryan Howard bat.

17:01.625 --> 17:03.583
Wife beat her husband
to death with it last
night.

17:03.667 --> 17:05.291
Well, maybe the
Phillies
will sign her.

17:05.375 --> 17:08.125
Yeah, maybe. What's up?

17:08.208 --> 17:10.375
Been going over
the Wanda Johnson case.

17:12.083 --> 17:13.458
Drawing a blank.

17:13.542 --> 17:16.417
15-year-old girl killed
in the Badlands back in '93.

17:16.500 --> 17:18.875
Had you run some partial
plates
from an eyewitness statement.

17:18.959 --> 17:20.166
You say so.

17:20.250 --> 17:22.291
We got a better
description of the
car.

17:22.375 --> 17:25.083
Turns out we were looking
for a '92 Ford Explorer.

17:25.166 --> 17:28.000
- Came up zilch.
- Yeah, we see that.

17:28.083 --> 17:29.959
Why'd you cross this one out?

17:30.041 --> 17:31.417
That was a long time ago.

17:33.041 --> 17:35.083
If I had to guess, I'd say it
was a wrong plate or something.

17:35.166 --> 17:37.709
(Nick)
'Well, you listed a reason
for all the others.'

17:37.792 --> 17:39.417
That one...nothing.

17:39.500 --> 17:43.333
I'll have to, uh, consult
my field notes, jog my
memory.

17:43.417 --> 17:46.875
I'd like to see
those notes, you don't mind.

17:46.959 --> 17:49.250
Yeah. I'll get right on that.

17:54.709 --> 17:56.834
Covering up for sloppy work?

17:56.917 --> 17:59.792
Let's hope that's all it is.

18:06.542 --> 18:09.709
Before you even any odds
with that street gun.

18:11.792 --> 18:13.583
This thing's still
packing a charge.

18:21.041 --> 18:24.166
I can't believe
she's hooked on painkillers.

18:24.250 --> 18:28.709
Oh. Probably after some
injury.
That's how it starts.

18:28.792 --> 18:32.542
She knew what crap
we went through with my mom..

18:32.625 --> 18:34.458
...growing up.

18:34.542 --> 18:36.750
You know, people think
they can just kick it

18:36.834 --> 18:40.250
but...it ain't that easy.

18:40.333 --> 18:42.375
These pills are
going straight from

18:42.458 --> 18:44.125
that pharmacy to the street.

18:44.208 --> 18:46.667
They grind up
the time-release
Oxys

18:46.750 --> 18:50.333
to smoke, snort,
shoot, whatever.

18:50.417 --> 18:53.000
(Scotty)
'Docs give 'em to anybody.
Pharmacists are..'

19:08.542 --> 19:10.542
I found this in the room.

19:11.709 --> 19:13.667
(Lilly)
'She tried to show me this.'

19:13.750 --> 19:16.917
Said she remembered
that swimsuit.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.500
But she was only like...five.

19:20.583 --> 19:22.709
I got photos of me that age.

19:22.792 --> 19:26.041
It makes you think
you remember being there.

19:37.750 --> 19:38.834
That him?

21:45.750 --> 21:48.458
Hey, what do you say, Will?

21:48.542 --> 21:51.083
Hey, I'm, uh, just knocking
off
to grab those files for you.

21:51.166 --> 21:54.542
- Don't bother!
- Get your hands off me!

21:54.625 --> 21:56.000
I'm giving you
one chance to explain

21:56.083 --> 21:58.291
how come you buried this.

21:58.375 --> 21:59.834
It was a fluke.

21:59.917 --> 22:01.250
Doherty had nothing to
do
with that girl getting
killed.

22:01.333 --> 22:02.792
Then why did you
delete the file?

22:02.875 --> 22:05.834
- He was my lieutenant.
- That puts him off-limits?

22:06.917 --> 22:08.583
Look, I gave him a heads-up.

22:08.667 --> 22:11.041
We had a good laugh
about it, and that was
it.

22:11.125 --> 22:13.083
- He ask you to bury the
report?
- No.

22:13.166 --> 22:14.625
I figured the last
thing
my lieutenant needed

22:14.709 --> 22:16.583
was his name popping up
in a hot investigation.

22:16.667 --> 22:18.792
Well, it popped.

22:18.875 --> 22:20.959
Look, I got respect
for chain of
command.

22:21.041 --> 22:22.250
So do I, Joe.

22:22.333 --> 22:24.500
Except when it comes
to covering up a crime.

22:24.583 --> 22:26.291
There wasn't no cover-up.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.583
You breathe a word
<i>anybody</i>

22:30.667 --> 22:33.125
I'll have you pushing
a sector car around the 12th.

22:33.208 --> 22:34.500
Yeah, we'll see about that.

22:41.166 --> 22:42.792
(Lilly)
Where is she, numbnuts?

22:42.875 --> 22:45.083
(Scotty)
You scream when I
take that sock out

22:45.166 --> 22:47.834
I'll make you eat
this whole bottle.

22:47.917 --> 22:50.083
The hell?

22:50.166 --> 22:51.166
What'd I do?

22:51.250 --> 22:53.542
Where is Christina?

22:53.625 --> 22:55.083
How the hell should I know?

22:55.166 --> 22:56.208
That's Cliff's old lady.

22:56.291 --> 22:57.959
Who the hell's Cliff,
and where is he?

22:58.041 --> 22:59.291
Back in Jersey.
I don't know!

22:59.375 --> 23:01.625
I hooked him up once
to move some blues.

23:01.709 --> 23:04.250
Easy stuff from
pain clinics in Florida.

23:04.333 --> 23:05.792
'Run them up to I-95 to Newark.'

23:05.875 --> 23:07.375
So, why is Cliff
coming down here?

23:07.458 --> 23:09.875
'Cause he sent his woman
down here to buy some pills.

23:09.959 --> 23:12.667
And she kept lying to him
saying
she couldn't get a hold of me.

23:12.750 --> 23:13.875
Why would she lie to him?

23:13.959 --> 23:15.333
She said she was
working
on another hookup.

23:15.417 --> 23:17.834
One week turned to two,
Cliff started losing it.

23:17.917 --> 23:19.000
He said he was gonna
have her ass.

23:19.083 --> 23:20.667
And you knew
where she was staying?

23:20.750 --> 23:23.542
I saw her outside a rehab clinic
and I followed her to the Grand.

23:23.625 --> 23:25.041
And you told him
where she was.

23:25.125 --> 23:28.333
Cliff, he's got
a possessive mean streak.

23:28.417 --> 23:29.917
Unhinged-like.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.375
He gave her the pimp hand and
hauled her ass out of there.

23:32.458 --> 23:34.083
- And you went there with him.
- No!

23:34.166 --> 23:36.500
He just told me to go
back and find the stash.

23:36.583 --> 23:39.250
- But I found you instead.
- You took my gun.

23:39.333 --> 23:40.667
Where's my sister?

23:40.750 --> 23:42.667
Your sister? What?

23:42.750 --> 23:45.041
No, man, that was
Cliff.
He took the gun, too.

23:45.125 --> 23:46.458
You said he was in Jersey.

23:46.542 --> 23:48.583
- Where?
- I don't know.

23:48.667 --> 23:50.667
Jersey City.
I've never been up there.

23:50.750 --> 23:53.000
I don't even know
the dude's last name.

23:53.083 --> 23:54.959
Come on, man.
All I got is a cell number.

23:55.041 --> 23:56.000
Check my phone.

23:56.083 --> 23:57.834
It's a Jersey area code.

23:57.917 --> 24:00.458
We'll be back.
You better be right.

24:00.542 --> 24:02.417
Try to make it last.

24:05.166 --> 24:07.125
(male #3)
'What? No dip?'

24:07.208 --> 24:11.000
That deleted plate match
came back belonging to Doherty.

24:11.083 --> 24:13.375
Could be one of those
grassy knoll
coincidences.

24:13.458 --> 24:14.750
Be inclined to
go there with you, Nick

24:14.834 --> 24:16.959
except I also got
a missing witness statement.

24:17.041 --> 24:18.875
Nobody's been in
that box except you.

24:18.959 --> 24:21.834
Well, that's where
nightstick
Joe comes into the
picture.

24:21.917 --> 24:23.375
(Nick)
'Let me guess.'

24:23.458 --> 24:25.375
He deleted the license plate
that came back to Doherty.

24:25.458 --> 24:27.208
Yeah. See where
I'm going with this?

24:27.291 --> 24:28.542
He's trying to get
in with the bosses.

24:28.625 --> 24:30.500
So he buries the report.

24:30.583 --> 24:32.667
Worse. He shows it to Doherty.

24:32.750 --> 24:35.542
And Doherty says
he'll take care of it.

24:35.625 --> 24:39.375
I owe it to Wanda Johnson...to
follow this thing to the end.

24:39.458 --> 24:41.792
Yeah, you're gonna follow it
right into forced retirement.

24:41.875 --> 24:44.208
So mote it be.

24:44.291 --> 24:46.375
You got anything else
linking Doherty to this

24:46.458 --> 24:49.917
except his car
and a missing witness
statement?

24:50.000 --> 24:51.792
How about a gun?

24:51.875 --> 24:53.542
Wanda was shot with a .38.

24:53.625 --> 24:56.375
Doherty never turned in
his department-issued .38

24:56.458 --> 24:58.208
when we got the new Glocks.

24:58.291 --> 25:00.583
Looks just like this
old wheel gun of mine.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.208
(Kat)
'Oh..'

25:02.291 --> 25:06.083
You think a police lieutenant
killed a 15-year-old girl?

25:06.166 --> 25:08.125
There's one way to find out.

25:08.208 --> 25:10.542
Suppose you know
where Doherty keeps his gun.

25:10.625 --> 25:13.750
Desk, top right drawer,
next to the bottle of Old
Spice.

25:13.834 --> 25:15.583
We just walk in there
and get that gun?

25:15.667 --> 25:18.458
Doherty's got his local
clergy meeting tonight..

25:19.333 --> 25:21.083
...but after that..

25:26.291 --> 25:28.625
There was a priest,
a rabbi, and a minister

25:28.709 --> 25:30.709
all in an elevator..

25:38.542 --> 25:39.625
Hey.

25:39.709 --> 25:41.458
The sink's clogged
in the ladies' room, Sal.

25:41.542 --> 25:42.750
I'll get to it after I finish

25:42.834 --> 25:45.125
touching up
the big boss's
office.

25:45.208 --> 25:46.500
You been hitting the gym?

25:46.583 --> 25:48.583
Just pushing
this
mop and bucket.

25:48.667 --> 25:51.166
Mm. You're looking toned.

25:51.250 --> 25:52.709
What did you say
was wrong with the
sink?

26:04.250 --> 26:06.125
Accusing the deputy
commissioner of murder, Will

26:06.208 --> 26:07.542
I mean, that's career suicide.

26:07.625 --> 26:10.667
Sixteen years I've
been
chewing on this case.

26:11.834 --> 26:13.583
Dreading the baked goods
she sends every year

26:13.667 --> 26:17.166
letting me know her
daughter's
killer is still out there.

26:37.333 --> 26:39.166
(John)
'You better get
your ducks lined up, Will'

26:39.250 --> 26:41.834
'before you go slinging
accusations at the brass.'

26:41.917 --> 26:43.417
In the process
of doing just
that.

26:43.500 --> 26:44.917
What are you up to, Will?

26:45.000 --> 26:47.417
Suppose Doherty's gun
were to turn up.

26:47.500 --> 26:49.834
Could you get preliminary
ballistics on it from FIU?

26:49.917 --> 26:51.500
We better be talking
hypothetical here

26:51.583 --> 26:53.208
because I am all out
of favors upstairs.

26:56.750 --> 26:59.458
One deputy commissioner's gun.

27:10.792 --> 27:13.208
Subscriber info on
the cell comes back

27:13.291 --> 27:16.875
to Clifton Harper in
Jersey City Heights.

27:16.959 --> 27:21.000
[sighs]
She's got this deranged
boyfriend after her.

27:21.083 --> 27:22.458
She really knows
how to pick them.

27:22.542 --> 27:23.750
Easy.

27:23.834 --> 27:25.875
And I don't know why
I should care anymore.

27:25.959 --> 27:29.166
Still blood. Still...hurts.

27:30.750 --> 27:34.208
Look, I'm sorry
I dragged you into this mess.

27:37.333 --> 27:38.208
Nah.

27:38.291 --> 27:41.250
I should have told you before.

27:45.333 --> 27:48.542
I mean, I-I feel like
I'm still responsible for
her.

27:49.834 --> 27:51.750
But I-I don't know how to..

27:51.834 --> 27:54.041
<i>this.</i>

27:55.417 --> 27:59.250
She went through
what you did,
too.

27:59.333 --> 28:01.417
Well, you would think it
would've brought us closer.

28:01.500 --> 28:05.250
But I barely remember
a time when we got along.

28:05.333 --> 28:08.208
When we were just..

28:08.291 --> 28:09.458
'...sisters.'

28:17.750 --> 28:20.000
Don't worry.
We'll build it
again.

28:22.500 --> 28:24.834
And one weekend,
my dad came back.

28:24.917 --> 28:28.542
He, uh, took us to the beach.

28:29.875 --> 28:31.583
'Christina was so happy.'

28:33.291 --> 28:34.709
But I knew.

28:34.792 --> 28:35.875
You knew what?

28:35.959 --> 28:38.417
He was just gonna leave again.

28:39.625 --> 28:41.875
And he did.

28:43.375 --> 28:45.333
'Look, whatever
happens, Scotty..'

28:47.458 --> 28:48.709
...thanks.

28:56.083 --> 28:58.291
You pulled me out of
a mayoral fund-raiser,
John.

28:58.375 --> 28:59.458
This better be good.

28:59.542 --> 29:00.917
Got a few questions, Pat.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.750
You got questions, you
come up to the fifth
floor

29:02.834 --> 29:03.792
and ask 'em in the morning.

29:03.875 --> 29:06.333
I don't think you want that.

29:06.417 --> 29:07.875
Careful, detective.

29:07.959 --> 29:09.250
Wanda Johnson.

29:12.166 --> 29:13.500
That supposed to mean something?

29:13.583 --> 29:14.959
Oh, we got a break
in the case.

29:15.041 --> 29:17.291
Great. Work it.

29:19.375 --> 29:20.750
Is this some kind of stunt?

29:20.834 --> 29:22.500
Wanda Johnson
was shot and killed

29:22.583 --> 29:24.959
in the Badlands back in '93.

29:25.041 --> 29:27.709
Witness came forward,
puts Wanda in your car.

29:27.792 --> 29:30.000
Green '92 Ford Explorer.

29:30.083 --> 29:31.959
Sounds like you have
an unreliable
witness.

29:32.041 --> 29:35.208
Oh, your car popped back
in the day off a partial
plate.

29:35.291 --> 29:37.583
Got deleted from the file.

29:37.667 --> 29:38.834
Okay.

29:38.917 --> 29:41.166
I see where this is going.

29:41.250 --> 29:42.583
And I'll warn you right now.

29:42.667 --> 29:44.750
I'll have both your
badges
and your pensions.

29:44.834 --> 29:46.250
Take your best shot.

29:46.333 --> 29:47.834
We'll see
whose badge goes first.

29:47.917 --> 29:49.333
What the hell does that mean?

29:49.417 --> 29:51.834
Witness statement putting
your car at the crime scene

29:51.917 --> 29:54.000
turned up missing from the box.

29:54.083 --> 29:55.583
You don't want
the feds in this, Pat.

29:55.667 --> 29:57.583
We're doing you a favor.

30:02.792 --> 30:03.875
We're done here.

30:03.959 --> 30:05.250
(Will)
Not until you tell us

30:05.333 --> 30:06.667
how a bullet from your gun

30:06.750 --> 30:08.417
ended up killing Wanda Johnson.

30:21.458 --> 30:22.542
You're bluffing.

30:24.250 --> 30:26.250
Came back
a definitive match, Pat.

30:31.583 --> 30:33.792
I'd like my FOP lawyer now.

30:33.875 --> 30:35.208
I'm still waiting for the truth.

30:35.291 --> 30:36.709
And I'd still like my lawyer.

30:36.792 --> 30:39.917
Night Wanda was shot
you were at Timmy Murphy's wake.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.125
- Whole department was there.
- Yeah. So what?

30:42.208 --> 30:43.959
I know what
you're
doing here, Pat.

30:44.041 --> 30:45.291
Stay out of this, John.

30:45.375 --> 30:46.625
(John)
'You left your
gun at home.'

30:46.709 --> 30:48.625
- No.
- 'Car was in the Badlands.'

30:48.709 --> 30:50.917
I know all about your
boy Matt's struggle with
drugs.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.208
This had nothing to do with my
son, and I'll stand for the
gun.

30:54.291 --> 30:55.834
That girl's mother
has been twisting

30:55.917 --> 30:58.250
in the wind for 16 years.

30:58.333 --> 31:00.208
I said Matty didn't do this.

31:01.083 --> 31:02.417
How do you know that?

31:03.709 --> 31:05.333
Because I asked him.

31:10.834 --> 31:11.750
What's this?

31:11.834 --> 31:14.166
I was gonna tell you about that.

31:14.250 --> 31:15.333
I'm listening.

31:15.417 --> 31:17.542
- Me and Ronnie..
- You went out drinking?

31:17.625 --> 31:20.875
- No!
- Don't lie to me.

31:20.959 --> 31:22.417
Okay.

31:22.500 --> 31:23.750
Just a little.

31:25.458 --> 31:26.667
How'd this happen?

31:26.750 --> 31:29.083
Ronnie got sick,
and there was an accident

31:29.166 --> 31:31.000
but...we cleaned it up, huh.

31:33.542 --> 31:35.333
Anything else
you wanna tell me?

31:45.709 --> 31:47.834
I wanted to believe him.

31:47.917 --> 31:50.375
- How'd he get your gun?
- I don't know.

31:50.458 --> 31:52.583
But you knew enough when
you heard about the shooting

31:52.667 --> 31:54.250
to make that
plate match go away.

31:54.333 --> 31:56.500
- You knew Matty was involved.
- No.

31:56.583 --> 31:59.291
(Will)
Buried that witness report.

31:59.375 --> 32:01.291
What kind of cop does that?

32:03.542 --> 32:05.458
He was my son.

32:05.542 --> 32:07.500
I was trying to protect him.

32:09.083 --> 32:10.500
It was that damn Ronnie Tavares.

32:10.583 --> 32:12.625
told
to stay away from him.

32:12.709 --> 32:17.458
We'll talk to him.

32:17.542 --> 32:19.625
Matt's turned his life around.

32:23.750 --> 32:26.750
He's got a family
and a son of his own now.

32:26.834 --> 32:28.542
Then maybe
he'll understand the hell

32:28.625 --> 32:31.250
he's put Althea Johnson through.

32:47.542 --> 32:50.041
Good to see you've pulled
yourself together, Matt.

32:50.125 --> 32:53.166
I understand
you're a father now.

32:53.250 --> 32:55.000
Lieutenant.

32:55.083 --> 32:56.208
You know what this is about?

32:57.542 --> 32:59.375
Remember Wanda?

33:02.125 --> 33:03.166
(John)
'We got your old running
buddy'

33:03.250 --> 33:05.208
Ronnie Tavares
in the other room.

33:05.291 --> 33:06.667
(Will)
'Really made
something of himself.'

33:06.750 --> 33:10.750
Meth addict, petty theft,
distribution.

33:10.834 --> 33:12.917
He's ready to cooperate.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.750
My father know about this?

33:14.834 --> 33:17.208
He's prepared to take
the fall for you.

33:17.291 --> 33:18.875
You gonna let that happen, Matt?

33:21.500 --> 33:25.000
- No.
- It's time to man up here,
son.

33:27.166 --> 33:28.834
(Will)
'How'd you know Wanda?'

33:30.709 --> 33:32.625
We met at a party
the week before.

33:32.709 --> 33:35.041
She was still in high school.

33:35.125 --> 33:37.208
Yeah, she didn't look it.

33:37.291 --> 33:39.750
How'd you meet her that night?

33:39.834 --> 33:43.333
We cruised by the school,
picked her up.

33:45.375 --> 33:46.792
I didn't even remember her name.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.917
Oh, dang..

33:52.000 --> 33:53.542
Yo, Wanda.

33:53.625 --> 33:54.875
Yo, Wanda.
It's me, Ronnie.

33:54.959 --> 33:57.458
- Yeah, so?
- Yo, let's go do this, man.

33:57.542 --> 33:59.083
Yo, in a minute, fool, relax.

33:59.166 --> 34:00.250
Yo, you're looking good, baby.

34:00.333 --> 34:03.417
- Let me holla at you.
- Holla?

34:03.500 --> 34:05.375
So...me and my boy
Matt right here

34:05.458 --> 34:07.792
we're trying to get
in a little adventure.

34:07.875 --> 34:09.792
- 'That so?'
- Yes.

34:09.875 --> 34:12.792
- What you doing?
- Waiting on my mom.

34:12.875 --> 34:14.208
Looks like she forgot you.

34:14.291 --> 34:17.458
Yo, you know we can give
you a ride, right? Come on.

34:21.709 --> 34:23.125
- Madam.
- Ha ha ha.

34:25.333 --> 34:27.458
Alright?

34:31.166 --> 34:32.792
Listen up, Ronnie.

34:32.875 --> 34:34.458
We got Matt Doherty next door.

34:34.542 --> 34:35.542
Yeah, good for you.

34:35.625 --> 34:37.500
Wrong, bad for you, Ronnie.

34:37.583 --> 34:39.000
Matt's got his life together.

34:39.083 --> 34:40.875
Plus his dad's a cop, big time.

34:40.959 --> 34:43.625
Means he knows
the art of the deal.

34:43.709 --> 34:46.125
I know how to deal.

34:46.208 --> 34:47.417
What'd Matt say?

34:47.500 --> 34:49.500
Says you lured Wanda
into that car.

34:49.583 --> 34:51.250
[chuckles]
He said
that?

34:51.333 --> 34:53.417
Said you were gonna
give her a ride home.

34:53.500 --> 34:54.333
Right.

34:54.417 --> 34:56.000
But you end up
in the Badlands?

34:56.083 --> 34:58.166
- Detour.
- For what?

34:58.250 --> 34:59.959
Show that dealer what's what.

35:00.041 --> 35:02.125
He ripped us off
the week before.

35:02.208 --> 35:04.750
Huh, so..

35:06.834 --> 35:08.458
That what the gun was for?

35:08.542 --> 35:11.625
That's not my gun,
and it wasn't my idea.

35:11.709 --> 35:14.375
Matt's painting a picture
putting it all on you.

35:14.458 --> 35:15.625
Matt..

35:17.000 --> 35:19.083
...he was tripping about
that dealer getting over on
us.

35:30.041 --> 35:31.208
It's him.

35:31.291 --> 35:32.625
Alright, man, so how
you wanna do this?

35:32.709 --> 35:34.667
Do what?
I said I wanted to go home.

35:34.750 --> 35:36.083
Yo, chill, baby, relax.

35:36.166 --> 35:37.417
We just got some
business to attend
to.

35:37.500 --> 35:40.291
Now you're all
"Boyz n the Hood?"

35:40.375 --> 35:41.375
Just tell him
you want something.

35:41.458 --> 35:44.000
I'm not telling him nothing.

35:44.083 --> 35:45.333
- Check this.
- Ah!

35:45.417 --> 35:46.875
- Yo, come on. Are you serious?
- What the hell?

35:46.959 --> 35:48.250
We're just gonna go
straight at 'em, man.

35:48.333 --> 35:49.750
You can't go point that
thing at a dealer, fool.

35:49.834 --> 35:51.208
These guys shoot back, man.

35:51.291 --> 35:52.875
I'm just gonna put
a little scare into him,
okay?

35:52.959 --> 35:54.709
You get my back with his boys.

35:54.792 --> 35:57.125
You guys are crazy. I'm out!

35:57.208 --> 35:58.542
Give me that thing, man.
This is no time to--

35:58.625 --> 35:59.875
- Get off of it!
- 'Stop!'

36:04.417 --> 36:07.417
Ronnie should have
never grabbed that gun.

36:07.500 --> 36:09.250
It was an accident.

36:09.333 --> 36:12.834
It also an accident you
don't
take Wanda to the
hospital?

36:16.792 --> 36:19.458
Lot of things
I should have done different.

36:19.542 --> 36:21.709
Worried about
what your father would say?

36:24.291 --> 36:25.834
It was all I could think about.

36:27.834 --> 36:29.166
What the hell
did you just do, man?

36:29.250 --> 36:30.500
Me? You grabbed the gun!

36:30.583 --> 36:32.417
We gotta get her
to a hospital, man.

36:32.500 --> 36:33.917
It was an accident. That's
what
we're gonna tell 'em, right?

36:34.000 --> 36:35.542
- It was an accident.
- 'Wanda.'

36:35.625 --> 36:37.458
Yo. Oh, man.

36:37.542 --> 36:39.041
- Wanda.
- 'Oh..'

36:39.125 --> 36:41.458
Oh, man, what are
we gonna do, Matt?

36:41.542 --> 36:44.750
Go, man. We gotta get her
out of this car!

36:44.834 --> 36:46.417
Ronnie said we had
to get rid of the body

36:46.500 --> 36:48.667
so that's what we did.

36:48.750 --> 36:50.917
Just dump her like that.

36:53.417 --> 36:55.792
I cleaned out the car.

36:55.875 --> 36:57.250
I put the gun back.

36:57.333 --> 36:59.291
(John)
'Then lied to your father.'

36:59.375 --> 37:01.667
But he knew, didn't he?

37:01.750 --> 37:03.583
Yeah, I could see it
in his eyes.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.625
All these years sober.

37:09.417 --> 37:12.333
It's like I've been waiting
for this day to come.

37:15.041 --> 37:17.542
So has Althea Johnson.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.625
Alright. A unit number for
Cliff Harper is on the
left.

37:28.709 --> 37:31.083
There are no lights on.
Nobody's home.

37:31.166 --> 37:34.000
Record for assault,
domestic violence.

37:34.083 --> 37:35.542
Guy's a real charmer.

37:35.625 --> 37:38.208
Let's pull around back.
See if we can find a way
in.

38:13.625 --> 38:15.083
Christina.

38:16.834 --> 38:18.458
Lil?

38:18.542 --> 38:20.000
He did this to you?

38:21.000 --> 38:23.917
[grunts]
He won't leave us alone.

38:25.625 --> 38:29.375
Cliff, where is he, Chris?

38:29.458 --> 38:33.000
No matter what I do,
he always finds us.

38:33.083 --> 38:34.709
I'm so sorry, Lil.

38:34.792 --> 38:37.000
What do you mean "us?"

38:37.083 --> 38:38.250
You have to get out of here.

38:38.333 --> 38:40.125
No, we're not
leaving without
you.

38:41.542 --> 38:44.500
It hurts to breathe.

38:44.583 --> 38:45.917
Can you walk?

38:46.000 --> 38:47.250
I tried.

38:48.959 --> 38:51.542
I can't leave.

38:51.625 --> 38:53.125
I'm not like you.

38:53.208 --> 38:54.709
We need to get her outta here.

38:54.792 --> 38:56.709
I thought..

38:56.792 --> 38:59.834
...if I just left
her with a friend..

38:59.917 --> 39:03.750
...and came home,
I could get it together.

39:03.834 --> 39:04.750
Left, left who?

39:04.834 --> 39:06.792
Then I could come and get her.

39:08.000 --> 39:11.250
And then we
could...be like that again.

39:11.333 --> 39:13.208
What are you talking about?

39:13.291 --> 39:14.917
Christina, we have to go.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.625
Like at the beach..

39:17.709 --> 39:19.917
...in the photo..

39:20.000 --> 39:21.834
...that dad gave me.

39:21.917 --> 39:24.041
<i>(Christina)</i>
<i>Do you remember that day,</i>
<i>Lil?</i>

39:24.125 --> 39:26.417
- Yeah, sure.
- When he came back?

39:26.500 --> 39:28.834
Yeah, yeah, sweetie, I remember.

39:39.041 --> 39:42.041
Can you help us rebuild it, dad?

39:42.125 --> 39:44.875
<i>I thought we were going</i>
<i>to be like that again.</i>

39:45.834 --> 39:47.083
Sisters.

39:48.875 --> 39:51.458
Sure, Chris, why not?

39:52.834 --> 39:55.625
I want it to be
like that for her.

39:55.709 --> 39:57.625
(Scotty)
Let's get her out.
Let's go. Come on.

39:57.709 --> 40:00.417
(Christina)
I gotta go, Lil, 'cause I
gotta switch out the laundry.

40:00.500 --> 40:01.625
(Lilly)
It's
okay.

40:01.709 --> 40:03.208
(Scotty)
Come on.

40:39.917 --> 40:42.792
(Cliff)
'Christina, time to get up.'

40:47.000 --> 40:49.125
What the hell?

40:55.375 --> 40:57.500
How could you
do that to my sister?

41:01.250 --> 41:02.667
Don't!

41:02.750 --> 41:05.834
You don't...wanna do that, Lil.

41:06.959 --> 41:09.458
(Scotty)
'Come on.'

41:12.208 --> 41:14.291
Let's go home.
