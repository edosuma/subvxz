WEBVTT

00:03.269 --> 00:04.463
I'm sorry, Kel.

00:04.504 --> 00:05.835
I just don't think
it's a good idea.

00:05.872 --> 00:07.840
Are you sure Tara doesn't have
any place else to stay?

00:07.874 --> 00:09.466
Yeah, she has someplace else
to go... the streets.

00:09.509 --> 00:10.635
That was her former address.

00:10.677 --> 00:12.907
My point, exactly.

00:14.114 --> 00:15.240
Look, Tara's really sweet.

00:15.281 --> 00:17.272
I just... I don't know.

00:17.317 --> 00:19.217
I just wish we knew her better.

00:19.252 --> 00:21.117
How long would this
arrangement be for?

00:21.154 --> 00:22.212
I mean, when would she move out?

00:22.255 --> 00:23.847
It would just be
for a couple of weeks.

00:23.890 --> 00:25.517
Dr. Browning is trying
to get her

00:25.558 --> 00:27.890
in one of the rooming houses
the hospital works with.

00:27.927 --> 00:29.326
Tara's been in rehab
for a month, Kel.

00:29.362 --> 00:31.227
Why have they not found her
a place to live?

00:31.264 --> 00:34.131
Look, I want her here.

00:34.167 --> 00:36.431
Please.

00:36.469 --> 00:38.130
I need her.

00:40.774 --> 00:43.072
She needs me.

00:45.378 --> 00:47.039
Okay.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:42.962 --> 02:44.486
Mmm.

02:44.531 --> 02:47.659
I don't see any good reason
for getting out of bed today.

02:47.700 --> 02:50.362
What about the KEG party
you're throwing tonight, honey?

02:50.403 --> 02:52.200
Well, I got

02:52.238 --> 02:54.638
the KEG brothers tending bar,

02:54.674 --> 02:57.006
I've got Nat bringing the food.

02:57.076 --> 03:00.671
While you ditch classes
and lay in bed all day.

03:00.713 --> 03:02.340
Nice.

03:02.382 --> 03:03.644
Yeah, I think so.

03:03.683 --> 03:04.945
Well, I'd ditch with you,

03:05.018 --> 03:07.350
but I have this thing

03:07.387 --> 03:10.083
called a conscience.

03:10.123 --> 03:12.216
Well, I have this thing
called a...

03:12.258 --> 03:14.123
Hold that thought.

03:14.160 --> 03:17.129
I was kind of hoping
that... you'd hold it.

03:20.600 --> 03:23.262
Hi. Come on in.

03:23.303 --> 03:25.294
Hi.

03:26.639 --> 03:28.129
Tea? Mineral water?

03:28.174 --> 03:30.608
No. No, that's all right.

03:30.643 --> 03:31.610
All right.

03:31.644 --> 03:33.077
So, how's Colin's
case coming?

03:33.112 --> 03:37.606
Well, I think the D.A. and I
have something we can work with.

03:37.650 --> 03:39.117
Well, I like the sound of that.

03:39.152 --> 03:40.380
But I have
to tell you

03:40.420 --> 03:42.718
that Colin is going
to have to serve some time.

03:42.755 --> 03:43.983
He can't.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.752
He won't survive it.

03:45.792 --> 03:47.225
Well, then we're back
to square one,

03:47.260 --> 03:49.125
which means pleading not guilty
and going to trial.

03:49.162 --> 03:51.255
We both know that
there's a preponderance

03:51.297 --> 03:52.525
of evidence against Colin.

03:52.565 --> 03:54.897
And if we lose...
which the odds favor...

03:54.934 --> 03:57.926
we have a lot less control
over sentencing.

03:57.971 --> 03:59.996
Okay.

04:00.039 --> 04:01.768
So what's the deal?

04:01.808 --> 04:04.402
Well, I can get it all reduced
to a maximum of six months.

04:04.444 --> 04:05.604
And considering the fact

04:05.645 --> 04:07.806
that Mr. Robbins is
a first-time offender

04:07.847 --> 04:10.077
and basically a responsible
member of the community,

04:10.116 --> 04:12.346
he's not going to do hard time.

04:12.385 --> 04:14.717
He'll serve minimum security.

04:14.754 --> 04:16.584
He can paint if he wants to,

04:16.623 --> 04:19.319
and basically, his
accommodations will be no worse

04:19.358 --> 04:21.589
than a county hospital.

04:21.628 --> 04:23.255
You understand?

04:23.296 --> 04:25.958
Yeah. Yeah, I understand.

04:25.999 --> 04:27.296
Good.

04:27.333 --> 04:29.426
Because now
you have a job to do.

04:29.469 --> 04:31.130
What's that?

04:31.170 --> 04:32.637
Sell this to my client.

04:39.245 --> 04:42.078
Hey. It's good to see you
around here as a civilian.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.912
Hi. It's good
to see you, too.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.076
How's Pediatrics?

04:45.118 --> 04:46.244
I like it.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.548
It could be my specialty.

04:47.587 --> 04:49.111
I'm sorry I haven't called you.

04:49.155 --> 04:50.679
- I've been so overwhelmed.
- I understand.

04:50.723 --> 04:51.883
- So, how's your roommate?
- Tara?

04:51.924 --> 04:53.186
She's good.
She's being released today.

04:53.226 --> 04:54.420
I'm here to pick her up.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.087
She's gonna be staying with me
for awhile.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.426
Oh, that's nice of you.

04:57.463 --> 04:59.431
You sound like
you don't approve.

04:59.465 --> 05:00.830
It's none of my business.

05:00.867 --> 05:02.698
But you don't approve?

05:02.735 --> 05:04.066
Relationships
can become very intense

05:04.103 --> 05:06.571
when two people find each other
the way you and Tara did.

05:06.606 --> 05:08.233
It doesn't always translate
to the real world.

05:08.274 --> 05:09.468
Wait a second.

05:09.509 --> 05:11.568
Aren't you the guy
who was telling me

05:11.611 --> 05:14.444
that helping others
is an important part of therapy?

05:14.480 --> 05:15.913
It is. When you're ready.

05:15.948 --> 05:17.313
Well, I want to do this,
and I think

05:17.350 --> 05:18.715
it's going to be good
for both of us.

05:18.751 --> 05:20.548
Well, what do I know anyway?
I'm not even a doctor.

05:20.586 --> 05:21.951
Just a mere med student

05:21.988 --> 05:24.821
who would still like to take you
to dinner one of these nights.

05:24.857 --> 05:25.949
How about tonight?

05:26.025 --> 05:28.084
I already have plans,
but you could join.

05:28.127 --> 05:29.958
A friend of mine's
having a party,

05:29.996 --> 05:31.554
and I would love some company.

05:31.597 --> 05:33.155
- That'd be great.
- Okay.

05:33.199 --> 05:34.325
Well, call me.

05:34.367 --> 05:36.232
All right.
I'll call you about 5:00?

05:36.269 --> 05:37.429
We'll see.

05:37.470 --> 05:38.664
Bye.

05:38.705 --> 05:39.967
Housekeeping to Psych One West.

05:47.780 --> 05:49.213
Your ride's here.

05:49.248 --> 05:51.546
Kelly, hey. Started to worry
that maybe you weren't coming.

05:51.584 --> 05:52.812
Why wouldn't I come?

05:52.852 --> 05:54.717
I don't know. You could have
changed your mind.

05:54.754 --> 05:55.914
I wouldn't have blamed you.

05:55.955 --> 05:57.582
I must really
be putting you out.

05:57.623 --> 05:58.920
No, you're not.

05:58.958 --> 06:00.755
Still, I'm so embarrassed
to be imposing.

06:00.793 --> 06:01.919
Tara, stop.

06:02.028 --> 06:03.928
You have nothing to
be embarrassed about.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.691
What about your roommates?

06:05.732 --> 06:07.256
They can't be happy
about this.

06:07.300 --> 06:08.631
They're fine.

06:08.668 --> 06:09.464
Really?

06:09.502 --> 06:10.434
Really.

06:10.470 --> 06:12.700
Okay.

06:12.739 --> 06:15.173
Kel, I just... I can't
say thank you enough.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.732
You already have.

06:16.776 --> 06:19.210
Come on, let's get you
out of here.

06:19.245 --> 06:21.236
Okay.

06:27.754 --> 06:29.244
Hey.

06:29.288 --> 06:31.051
Hey, Val.
How's it going?

06:31.090 --> 06:32.921
You don't really
want to know.

06:32.959 --> 06:34.187
Colin?

06:34.227 --> 06:35.626
Yeah.

06:35.661 --> 06:37.788
I was just with his lawyer,
and he's facing jail time

06:37.830 --> 06:38.956
no matter how you cut it.

06:38.998 --> 06:40.659
Ooh. I guess you got
to commit murder

06:40.700 --> 06:42.361
to get away with anything
in this town.

06:42.402 --> 06:45.633
Anyway, I have to
break the news to him.

06:45.671 --> 06:47.969
He's going to go to prison.

06:48.007 --> 06:49.440
It's pretty frightening.

06:49.475 --> 06:51.306
Yeah.

06:51.344 --> 06:53.904
Listen, Brandon,
I really want to bring him

06:53.946 --> 06:55.709
to the party tonight.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.340
Val, it doesn't sound to me

06:57.383 --> 06:59.749
like Colin's going
to want to go anywhere tonight.

06:59.786 --> 07:00.753
So is that a no?

07:02.522 --> 07:05.082
There's going to be a lot
of people here tonight

07:05.124 --> 07:07.922
that have a lot of problems
with a certain Colin Robbins.

07:07.994 --> 07:09.359
Well, then maybe
they should get over it.

07:09.395 --> 07:11.386
Think about what it would
feel like to be in his shoes.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.898
I mean, he's been
hurt enough already.

07:12.932 --> 07:15.492
Fine. Val, you live here,
you can invite him if you want.

07:15.535 --> 07:17.127
I just can't give you
any guarantees

07:17.170 --> 07:18.535
- as to what's gonna happen.
- Fine.

07:18.571 --> 07:19.902
- Fine.
- Fine.

07:19.939 --> 07:20.564
Fine.

07:25.044 --> 07:26.671
Fine!

07:26.712 --> 07:29.272
Fine!

07:31.384 --> 07:32.851
Here we go.

07:32.885 --> 07:34.409
Eggs over well,

07:34.454 --> 07:36.752
hash browns, sausage,
hot chocolate,

07:36.789 --> 07:39.087
all courtesy
of your loving family.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.558
Thanks, Nat.

07:40.593 --> 07:42.185
What are you guys after?

07:42.228 --> 07:43.422
Nothing, bro.

07:43.463 --> 07:44.157
Really.

07:44.197 --> 07:46.062
I'm not hungry.

07:46.098 --> 07:48.259
Well, actually, there
is a little something.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.825
Not a big deal at all.

07:49.869 --> 07:50.961
Forget it.

07:51.070 --> 07:52.901
We haven't even told you
what it is yet.

07:52.939 --> 07:54.099
- Let's keep it that way.
- Steve!

07:54.140 --> 07:56.165
Please, sit down, will you?

07:56.209 --> 07:57.972
I need your help
for one night.

07:58.077 --> 08:00.637
Got to go to Palm Springs
to meet a client.

08:00.680 --> 08:02.375
- We won't get in your way.
- We promise.

08:02.415 --> 08:04.144
- When?
- Tonight.

08:04.183 --> 08:05.172
- No way!
- Oh, please, will you?

08:05.218 --> 08:07.243
Their mother and I don't
want to leave them alone.

08:07.286 --> 08:08.878
I don't trust
them, either, Dad.

08:08.921 --> 08:10.081
I'm having a party tonight.

08:10.122 --> 08:11.612
Excellent.

08:11.657 --> 08:12.851
Perfect timing, Dad.

08:12.892 --> 08:14.416
Please don't do this to me.

08:14.460 --> 08:16.121
I really appreciate
it, son, I really do.

08:16.162 --> 08:17.561
You two...

08:17.597 --> 08:19.224
you behave yourselves.
Is that understood?

08:19.265 --> 08:20.755
Yeah, yeah.

08:20.800 --> 08:21.892
Cool.

08:21.934 --> 08:23.060
Yeah.

08:23.102 --> 08:24.330
Cool.

08:24.370 --> 08:26.099
They're all yours, my boy.

08:26.138 --> 08:28.129
Thanks a lot, Dad.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.039
Party time.

08:31.043 --> 08:32.169
200 bucks to babysit.

08:32.211 --> 08:33.701
Not bad.

08:35.815 --> 08:39.683
All I ever wanted
was a place like this.

08:39.719 --> 08:41.778
If I just could
have gotten a job

08:41.821 --> 08:43.186
that paid some decent money,

08:43.222 --> 08:45.520
things would have
been different.

08:45.558 --> 08:47.890
- Well, it's not too late.
- I guess.

08:47.927 --> 08:49.690
Probably would have helped
if I hadn't have dropped out

08:49.729 --> 08:50.855
of high school, though.

08:50.897 --> 08:52.626
That's the first thing
you should do...

08:52.665 --> 08:53.859
go back to school.

08:53.900 --> 08:56.266
That's what I want.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.633
Mind if I try?

08:59.672 --> 09:00.934
No, go ahead.

09:03.843 --> 09:05.071
What do you think?

09:05.111 --> 09:06.635
Mmm, it smells good on you.

09:06.679 --> 09:07.907
- Are you hungry?
- Oh, starving.

09:08.014 --> 09:10.380
I was so nervous
about leaving, I didn't eat.

09:10.416 --> 09:12.111
Come on.
Okay.

09:13.653 --> 09:15.848
Wow. Nice painting.

09:15.888 --> 09:17.048
Colin?

09:17.089 --> 09:18.750
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

09:18.791 --> 09:20.224
All righty,

09:20.259 --> 09:22.318
you make the coffee,
I'll make the toast.

09:22.361 --> 09:23.487
Okay.

09:23.529 --> 09:25.463
The filters are
in the drawer right there,

09:25.498 --> 09:27.489
and the coffee's
in the fridge.

09:28.801 --> 09:31.031
Ooh. Mind
if I have some juice?

09:31.070 --> 09:32.833
Oh, yeah.
That's Clare's, but

09:32.872 --> 09:34.271
- she won't mind.
- You sure?

09:34.307 --> 09:35.934
Yeah. We all share
around here.

09:35.975 --> 09:37.533
Pour me a glass, too.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.602
Okay.

09:45.017 --> 09:46.917
Uh-oh.

09:46.953 --> 09:48.682
That's it for the juice.

09:48.721 --> 09:50.746
Oh, don't worry about it.

09:53.392 --> 09:55.360
Okay, you know how they say

09:55.394 --> 09:57.191
that today is the first day
of the rest of your life?

09:57.229 --> 09:58.355
Yeah.

09:58.397 --> 09:59.625
Well, I figured something out.

09:59.665 --> 10:00.962
- What?
- I figured out

10:01.000 --> 10:03.332
that today could be the last day
of my life,

10:03.369 --> 10:04.961
so I'd better start living it
accordingly.

10:05.037 --> 10:06.129
I'll drink to that.

10:10.476 --> 10:11.704
Hi, guys.

10:11.744 --> 10:12.972
Hi.

10:13.045 --> 10:14.239
Hey, Tara. Welcome back.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.406
Hi.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.915
How was school?

10:16.949 --> 10:19.850
Ugh! I have so much
homework to do, if I don't start

10:19.885 --> 10:22.513
on it now, I'm never gonna be
done in time for Steve's party.

10:22.555 --> 10:23.817
Yeah, I just come home
for a quick bite to eat.

10:23.856 --> 10:25.949
I have Art History at 2:00.

10:25.992 --> 10:27.687
Listen, guys,
Tara's going to sleep

10:27.727 --> 10:28.785
on the couch.

10:28.828 --> 10:30.557
Yeah, that's what we thought.

10:30.596 --> 10:32.894
Sure, no problem.

10:32.932 --> 10:34.490
No more juice?

10:35.534 --> 10:37.331
I'm so sorry.

10:37.370 --> 10:38.564
I'll replace it.

10:38.604 --> 10:41.664
That's okay. No problem.

10:41.707 --> 10:44.301
Here, have mine.

10:44.343 --> 10:45.640
Thanks.

10:49.248 --> 10:51.580
Not exactly how I wanted
to start out here.

10:51.617 --> 10:52.743
What is her problem?

10:52.785 --> 10:54.150
It's only juice.

10:54.186 --> 10:55.778
Yeah, well, I used the last

10:55.821 --> 10:57.618
of her hair conditioner
this morning, so...

10:57.657 --> 10:59.352
Don't worry, Tara.

10:59.392 --> 11:00.791
Um, Clare's just a little

11:00.826 --> 11:03.124
on the edge about having
a new person in the apartment,

11:03.162 --> 11:05.221
but, uh, you know,
give it a couple of days,

11:05.264 --> 11:06.697
and we'll all get along
just fine.

11:06.732 --> 11:08.700
Thanks, Donna.
That means a lot to me.

11:09.969 --> 11:11.596
You want some coffee?

11:11.637 --> 11:13.468
Yeah, that would be great.

11:14.974 --> 11:16.771
Think I'll make one
for Clare, too.

11:16.809 --> 11:18.401
She could probably use it
while she's studying.

11:28.154 --> 11:29.621
Hi.

11:33.092 --> 11:35.083
Hi.

11:37.229 --> 11:38.719
So, come on.

11:38.764 --> 11:40.288
I'm-I'm on pins
and needles here.

11:40.332 --> 11:41.629
What's going on?

11:41.667 --> 11:42.929
What happened with Crane?

11:42.968 --> 11:44.458
Look, we need to talk.

11:44.503 --> 11:46.528
No.

11:46.572 --> 11:47.834
No way.

11:47.873 --> 11:48.999
I told you.

11:49.075 --> 11:50.599
I-I'm not going back
behind bars.

11:50.643 --> 11:52.133
Look, you have no choice.

11:53.879 --> 11:55.870
Oh, man.

12:06.392 --> 12:08.792
Look, it's not going to be like
where you were.

12:08.828 --> 12:10.557
It'll be minimum security,

12:10.596 --> 12:11.961
Club Fed.

12:12.064 --> 12:13.497
They call it a country club.

12:13.532 --> 12:14.829
Compared to what?

12:14.867 --> 12:18.496
Compared to Soledad
or Chino, that's what.

12:18.537 --> 12:21.097
You'll serve
a maximum six months,

12:21.140 --> 12:23.233
and you're not gonna be
with hardened criminals.

12:23.275 --> 12:24.833
I mean, these guys are in there
for like fancy bookkeeping,

12:24.877 --> 12:25.935
not killing people.

12:25.978 --> 12:28.242
- He said that?
- Yeah...

12:28.280 --> 12:30.646
That's the deal he thinks
he can get from the D.A.

12:32.985 --> 12:34.418
Only, you have to agree.

12:34.453 --> 12:36.978
This is really happening, huh?

12:38.457 --> 12:40.322
What about going to trial?

12:40.359 --> 12:43.192
It could be a lot worse...

12:43.229 --> 12:45.129
a lot worse if you lose.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.594
Okay.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.430
Let's make the deal.

12:59.812 --> 13:02.337
Now, let's enjoy the time
we have while we have it, okay?

13:02.381 --> 13:03.609
Let's have
a good time tonight.

13:03.649 --> 13:05.207
Yeah. I could use that.

13:08.154 --> 13:10.622
Well, um...

13:10.656 --> 13:12.749
there's a big party
at my house.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.283
We could go.

13:15.327 --> 13:18.660
That's not quite my idea
of a good time.

13:18.697 --> 13:21.530
Well, I at least want
to put in an appearance.

13:21.567 --> 13:23.159
Please?

13:23.202 --> 13:26.399
Is Kelly gonna be there?

13:29.408 --> 13:30.705
Yeah, yeah.

13:30.743 --> 13:31.971
Sure, why?

13:32.011 --> 13:34.571
I don't know, I mean,
she could make a scene.

13:34.613 --> 13:36.308
Well, if she can't handle
you being there for an hour,

13:36.348 --> 13:37.906
that's her problem.

13:37.950 --> 13:39.645
Yeah.

13:39.685 --> 13:42.119
Besides, it's not like you care
what she thinks anymore anyway.

13:42.154 --> 13:43.781
Mmm...

13:43.823 --> 13:45.814
You're right.

13:45.858 --> 13:49.021
You're right. Let's go.

13:59.872 --> 14:01.931
All right,
good work, guys.

14:01.974 --> 14:03.168
Look, when it's
all in the corner,

14:03.209 --> 14:05.074
cover it with these sheets,
okay, to protect it.

14:05.110 --> 14:06.338
And then what?

14:06.378 --> 14:07.606
And then go help Nat haul
the food over here.

14:07.646 --> 14:09.546
He means what do we get
for our efforts?

14:09.582 --> 14:11.550
If you're lucky, a thank you.

14:12.718 --> 14:14.208
How about a beer?

14:14.253 --> 14:16.278
How about
a knuckle sandwich?

14:16.322 --> 14:19.223
Okay.

14:19.258 --> 14:22.352
How about a knuckle sandwich?

14:23.729 --> 14:24.696
- Hello.
- Hello.

14:24.730 --> 14:25.788
We got everything on the list.

14:25.831 --> 14:26.889
And then some.

14:26.932 --> 14:28.331
I hope you're expecting
a big crowd, bro.

14:28.367 --> 14:29.766
We've got more
in the car.

14:29.802 --> 14:32.066
I invited everyone I know,
and I told them each to invite

14:32.104 --> 14:33.401
three people that I don't know.

14:33.439 --> 14:34.770
Ah, sounds intimate.

14:34.807 --> 14:36.502
Maybe we should've gotten
some more soda or something.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.601
Well, I think they'll all be
drinking harder stuff.

14:38.644 --> 14:39.906
With one or two
exceptions.

14:39.945 --> 14:42.573
Speak of the devil.

14:42.615 --> 14:44.480
Hey, Brandon, listen.
Did you get those chips,

14:44.516 --> 14:46.177
you know,
the ones that have the...?

14:47.319 --> 14:48.946
Put the beer back.

14:48.988 --> 14:50.853
Beer back.
Attaboy.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.187
Come on.

14:52.224 --> 14:53.486
One beer never
hurt anybody.

14:53.525 --> 14:55.117
Ha. Famous last words.

14:56.462 --> 14:57.986
Why don't you guys go do

14:58.063 --> 15:00.258
something constructive...
like beat each other up?

15:00.299 --> 15:02.824
Did they ever walk fully erect?

15:02.868 --> 15:03.926
They're monkeys.

15:03.969 --> 15:05.300
So, look,
I talked to Valerie.

15:05.337 --> 15:06.269
Looks like Colin's
going to jail.

15:06.305 --> 15:07.135
Well, he deserves it.

15:07.172 --> 15:08.230
So she's not coming?

15:08.274 --> 15:09.935
Uh, actually, um...
she is.

15:10.042 --> 15:12.101
She called and asked
if she could bring Colin,

15:12.144 --> 15:13.839
and, uh...
I said it would be okay.

15:13.879 --> 15:15.210
I figured there'd be
enough people here,

15:15.247 --> 15:16.612
- no one would notice.
- Yeah, what the hell.

15:16.649 --> 15:18.310
As long as I don't have
to dance with him.

15:18.350 --> 15:20.284
- Not even the lambada?
- Lambada me.

15:20.319 --> 15:22.310
Well, you know, it is forbidden.

15:24.356 --> 15:25.618
I don't know, Kelly.

15:25.658 --> 15:27.353
It sounds like this party's
going to be pretty wild.

15:27.393 --> 15:29.418
There's probably going to be
a lot of drinking.

15:29.461 --> 15:30.723
What if there's drugs there?

15:30.763 --> 15:32.560
Then we'll keep each other
out of trouble.

15:33.866 --> 15:35.527
I really want you to come, Tara.

15:35.567 --> 15:36.499
Really?

15:36.535 --> 15:37.797
Yes, we'll have a great time.

15:37.836 --> 15:38.928
But what would I wear?

15:38.971 --> 15:40.598
You can pick anything you want
out of my closet.

15:45.678 --> 15:47.475
Wow!

15:49.181 --> 15:51.081
Now just tell me
if I'm snooping too much.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.845
No. Snoop away.

15:52.885 --> 15:54.147
So, what are you going to wear?

15:54.186 --> 15:56.086
I haven't really decided yet.

15:57.389 --> 15:58.788
This is my favorite.

15:58.824 --> 16:00.655
Oh, good choice.

16:00.693 --> 16:01.887
That's the one
I was thinking of wearing.

16:01.927 --> 16:03.690
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No!

16:03.729 --> 16:04.718
No, go ahead, wear it.

16:04.763 --> 16:06.458
I have plenty of others.
Please.

16:06.498 --> 16:07.658
Are you sure?

16:07.700 --> 16:08.860
Yes, I'm sure.

16:08.901 --> 16:10.926
Okay.
I'm going to take a shower.

16:11.003 --> 16:12.937
Okay. Don't take
too long.

16:13.005 --> 16:14.097
Okay.

16:22.548 --> 16:25.039
Hey, David, what you up to?

16:25.084 --> 16:26.381
Hey, what's going on, Joe?

16:26.418 --> 16:28.909
Just waiting on your
girlfriend, actually.

16:28.954 --> 16:31.320
Yeah, punctuality is not
one of Donna's strong points.

16:31.357 --> 16:33.086
Oh, believe me, I remember.

16:33.125 --> 16:34.456
Donna tells me
you guys are doing

16:34.493 --> 16:36.552
some video at Steve's party?

16:36.595 --> 16:38.324
Yeah. One of the producers
from "C.U. Later"

16:38.364 --> 16:40.355
asked me to do this
little party piece for his show.

16:40.399 --> 16:41.696
So, uh...

16:41.734 --> 16:42.962
I'm good at running the camera,

16:43.035 --> 16:45.230
but... I'm not very good
at talking.

16:45.270 --> 16:46.828
That's Donna's strong suit.

16:48.307 --> 16:49.399
So I've heard.

16:49.441 --> 16:50.908
Sorry I'm late.

16:50.943 --> 16:51.967
What?

16:52.077 --> 16:53.135
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:53.178 --> 16:54.145
Bye.

16:54.179 --> 16:55.976
- Bye?
- I'm off to economics.

16:56.015 --> 16:56.982
Good luck.

16:57.016 --> 16:57.983
Thanks a lot, man.
See you later.

16:58.017 --> 16:58.984
See you.

16:59.051 --> 17:01.076
- What's up?
- I, uh, put together

17:01.120 --> 17:03.315
this little list of questions
for Steve's party.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.585
You know I always wing it.

17:05.624 --> 17:07.057
I know.

17:07.092 --> 17:08.457
It's just, you know,
you haven't done it in a while,

17:08.493 --> 17:10.086
and I thought you might be
a little rusty.

17:10.128 --> 17:13.291
Yeah, we haven't worked together
in a long time, huh?

17:13.332 --> 17:15.596
No.

17:15.634 --> 17:17.124
But, uh,
I'm looking forward to it.

17:17.169 --> 17:18.465
Yeah, me, too.

17:20.705 --> 17:23.003
Let's see...

17:27.012 --> 17:30.345
Mmm, you feel so good.

17:30.382 --> 17:32.179
Mmm, you, too.

17:32.217 --> 17:33.411
But you know what?

17:33.452 --> 17:35.181
I've got to get ready
for the party.

17:39.091 --> 17:41.992
You know, I think we should
just blow this thing off.

17:43.028 --> 17:44.359
I mean...

17:44.396 --> 17:46.057
I don't know why I ever
wanted to go in the first place.

17:46.098 --> 17:47.326
I mean, who needs it, you know?

17:47.366 --> 17:48.697
Wait a second.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.702
You said you were gonna go,
and now you're flaking?

17:50.736 --> 17:52.067
I'd just rather stay here
with you.

17:52.104 --> 17:53.264
No, no...

17:53.305 --> 17:54.772
Listen, you've got
to get out of here.

17:54.807 --> 17:56.968
You have to face
these things.

17:57.042 --> 17:58.441
If you can make it through
the party with this crowd

17:58.477 --> 18:00.342
tonight, everything else
will be a piece of cake.

18:01.613 --> 18:02.910
I don't want to go.

18:02.948 --> 18:04.575
I really don't want to go.

18:04.616 --> 18:06.083
Why, are you still worried
about seeing Kelly?

18:06.118 --> 18:07.847
No. No.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.318
Look, I don't know,

18:11.356 --> 18:12.846
it's just every time
I get around these guys,

18:12.891 --> 18:14.222
I feel like a real lowlife.

18:14.259 --> 18:16.227
You shouldn't let anybody make
you feel that way.

18:16.261 --> 18:18.752
You know...

18:18.797 --> 18:21.163
sometimes I know exactly
what you mean, Valerie,

18:21.200 --> 18:23.930
and sometimes...

18:23.969 --> 18:27.166
I don't know.

18:27.206 --> 18:29.766
Look, the bottom line is...

18:29.808 --> 18:31.400
you spend two weeks in jail,

18:31.443 --> 18:32.910
you know exactly where
you want to be.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.207
Where do you want to be?

18:34.246 --> 18:35.338
Right here,

18:35.380 --> 18:37.473
right now, with you,

18:37.516 --> 18:38.983
not them.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.159
How do I look?

18:54.199 --> 18:55.928
Perfect.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.959
Ooh, there's just one thing
missing.

19:02.608 --> 19:05.304
This is my favorite necklace.

19:05.344 --> 19:06.504
Oh, I couldn't.

19:06.545 --> 19:07.910
No, I want you to wear it.

19:07.946 --> 19:09.243
It looks beautiful.

19:13.018 --> 19:14.849
Oh, can you get
that for me?

19:14.887 --> 19:17.913
Sure.

19:17.956 --> 19:21.153
Hello?

19:21.193 --> 19:24.356
No, not Kelly.

19:24.396 --> 19:25.624
Who is this?

19:27.199 --> 19:28.188
Oh, hi, Greg.

19:28.233 --> 19:29.495
Yeah, this is Tara.

19:29.535 --> 19:31.059
Wonderful.

19:31.103 --> 19:33.469
Although, I think I'm starting
to get on her nerves a little.

19:33.505 --> 19:34.836
Hang on, I'll get her.

19:35.974 --> 19:38.033
- It's Greg.
- Oh, thanks.

19:38.076 --> 19:39.043
Hello?

19:39.077 --> 19:40.044
- Hi. Kelly?
- Hi.

19:40.078 --> 19:41.511
See? I called this time.

19:41.547 --> 19:44.607
Um, do you want to come and pick
me up at my apartment?

19:44.650 --> 19:46.413
I'll give you the address.

19:46.451 --> 19:47.679
I can't.
I'm on call till 10:00,

19:47.719 --> 19:48.913
but I'd love to meet you
at the party.

19:48.954 --> 19:52.720
Okay.
It's, um, 953 Hillcrest Drive.

19:52.758 --> 19:54.385
Great. So how are things going
with Tara?

19:54.426 --> 19:56.758
It's going good.

19:56.795 --> 19:58.319
You can stop worrying.

19:58.363 --> 19:59.955
Yes, ma'am.
I'll see you tonight.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.329
All right, bye.

20:04.002 --> 20:05.367
You have a date with Greg?

20:05.404 --> 20:06.962
Yeah. What do you think?

20:07.005 --> 20:09.200
It's just... a little weird.

20:09.241 --> 20:10.833
I mean, he was, like,
one of our doctors.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.810
No, he wasn't.
He was a medical student.

20:12.844 --> 20:14.573
I'm sure it'll be fine.

20:14.613 --> 20:16.581
He seems like a terrific guy.

20:16.615 --> 20:18.139
Yeah, he seems like it.

20:18.183 --> 20:20.310
So, um...

20:20.352 --> 20:21.785
he's going to the party?

20:21.820 --> 20:24.584
Yeah. He's going
to meet us there.

20:24.623 --> 20:26.591
Then, you don't mind
if I bail?

20:28.460 --> 20:29.620
We already talked about this.

20:29.661 --> 20:31.458
I need you there.

20:31.496 --> 20:33.293
No, you don't.
You have Greg.

20:33.332 --> 20:34.856
Tara, what is this about?

20:34.900 --> 20:37.869
You can't fit three
on a love seat.

20:37.903 --> 20:39.700
Love seat?
What are you talking about?

20:39.738 --> 20:40.966
It's our first date.

20:41.006 --> 20:42.633
Come on.

20:42.674 --> 20:44.107
Maybe you'll meet
somebody at the party.

20:44.142 --> 20:46.007
No, I'm not that lucky.

20:46.044 --> 20:47.671
You've had a boyfriend before,
right?

20:47.713 --> 20:50.147
I've had guys that I slept with,

20:50.182 --> 20:52.013
but no one that ever cared
about me

20:52.084 --> 20:53.813
or that I cared about.

20:53.852 --> 20:55.752
Well, all that is
going to change,

20:55.787 --> 20:57.015
starting tonight.

20:57.055 --> 21:00.388
I do kind of feel
like Cinderella.

21:00.425 --> 21:02.950
Maybe I'll meet a prince.

21:03.028 --> 21:05.690
Or maybe a frog
who needs some work.

21:05.731 --> 21:09.667
You know, with you,
I think I really can make it.

21:09.701 --> 21:10.827
That's the attitude.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.744
Okay, let's party.

21:19.778 --> 21:22.747
Alcohol to the left,
dancing is on the right.

21:22.781 --> 21:25.147
Hey, Muntz, no swinging
from the chandeliers.

21:25.183 --> 21:26.741
Be careful with that tequila,
you'll hurt yourself.

21:26.785 --> 21:27.877
All right, brother.

21:27.919 --> 21:28.908
Don't forget,
drinking to the right,

21:28.954 --> 21:30.080
dancing to the left,

21:30.122 --> 21:31.350
- having a great time.
- Come on in, folks.

21:31.390 --> 21:32.516
There's random party favors
throughout the house...

21:32.557 --> 21:34.354
Whoa, whoa. Two fine-looking
ladies in black,

21:34.393 --> 21:36.122
coming up the walk.

21:36.161 --> 21:37.992
- Hi. - Hello.
- Hi, Kel.

21:38.096 --> 21:39.085
Hey, Kelly.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.291
- Hey, Kelly.
- Hello.

21:40.332 --> 21:41.594
- You look awesome.
- Thank you.

21:41.633 --> 21:43.601
I'm so glad to see
you out and about.

21:43.635 --> 21:44.602
And who's your escort?

21:44.636 --> 21:45.660
I'm Tara,
Kelly's friend.

21:45.704 --> 21:47.604
Tara, Hi. I'm Brandon.

21:47.639 --> 21:48.765
Brandon.

21:48.807 --> 21:51.241
I think I've heard
a little bit about you.

21:51.276 --> 21:52.937
Disregard that.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.775
Well, uh, come on in
and meet everybody.

21:54.813 --> 21:56.007
Start with me.
I'm Steve Sanders.

21:56.048 --> 21:57.015
Hi.

21:57.082 --> 21:58.743
Nice to meet you.
Welcome to the party.

21:58.784 --> 21:59.910
Come on in.

21:59.951 --> 22:01.680
Nice kid.

22:01.720 --> 22:03.620
Yeah.

22:03.655 --> 22:05.122
How come you haven't come
to see me since I've been home?

22:05.157 --> 22:07.250
I didn't want to crowd you.

22:07.292 --> 22:09.055
I figured maybe
you needed some space.

22:09.094 --> 22:11.585
How is it that you always know
exactly what I need?

22:11.630 --> 22:13.495
Instincts.
Good instincts.

22:14.499 --> 22:15.864
You look great.

22:15.901 --> 22:17.129
I feel great.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.830
Ooh, yes you do.

22:24.042 --> 22:25.100
Hi, Kelly.

22:25.143 --> 22:26.610
Susan, hi.

22:26.645 --> 22:28.909
I never got to thank you for
all the flowers that you sent.

22:28.947 --> 22:30.972
Oh, don't mention it. We're just
all glad to have you back.

22:31.016 --> 22:32.210
Thanks.

22:32.250 --> 22:33.308
Oh, sorry. There's food
and drinks in the kitchen,

22:33.352 --> 22:35.320
if you're thirsty
or hungry or...

22:35.354 --> 22:37.515
You read my mind.
See you later.

22:39.491 --> 22:40.458
So...

22:40.492 --> 22:41.959
You know, when we first
started dating,

22:41.993 --> 22:44.393
I wasn't sure how
I'd feel about Kelly.

22:44.429 --> 22:46.659
And now?

22:46.698 --> 22:49.531
She's nice.

22:49.568 --> 22:51.399
In fact, I think
all your friends are nice.

22:51.436 --> 22:53.131
Well, they are,
they're kind of nice.

22:53.171 --> 22:55.071
They're all right, I guess.

22:56.575 --> 22:58.634
You are watching

22:58.677 --> 23:00.372
the interfraternity
quarters competition,

23:00.412 --> 23:01.936
live on the scene
from the Walsh house,

23:02.013 --> 23:03.947
better known as KEG West.

23:03.982 --> 23:05.677
Now each KEGer has had

23:05.717 --> 23:06.945
no less than three shots each

23:07.018 --> 23:08.781
and the Deltas
are up to four shots each.

23:12.324 --> 23:14.315
Drink! Drink! Drink!

23:15.160 --> 23:17.151
Oh, and Muntz misses.

23:17.195 --> 23:20.221
Down the hatch
with shot number four.

23:20.265 --> 23:21.562
Now viewers,
remember,

23:21.600 --> 23:23.158
each time they drink, it
makes it that much harder

23:23.201 --> 23:24.793
to get the quarter in
the next time.

23:24.836 --> 23:26.269
We'll be coming back
to them later.

23:30.342 --> 23:32.333
Good luck, buddy.

23:38.350 --> 23:40.648
Hey, Muntz, come on.

23:40.685 --> 23:42.152
Let us into the action.

23:42.187 --> 23:44.553
Yeah, right.
Let me see your ID, huh?

23:44.589 --> 23:46.750
Ah, come on,
Muntz, you cow.

23:46.792 --> 23:48.259
It's cool with Steve.

23:48.293 --> 23:50.352
- Ask him.
- Hey, Sanders?

23:51.563 --> 23:53.497
- Are these two fair game?
- Please, bro.

23:54.566 --> 23:56.727
How are we ever going
to get any good at it

23:56.768 --> 23:58.599
- if we don't practice?
- Boy's got a point, Steve.

23:58.637 --> 24:00.867
Maybe if we put a hat on
it, it won't show, huh?

24:01.940 --> 24:03.635
All right. One round.

24:03.675 --> 24:05.108
All right, you sit there.

24:05.143 --> 24:06.974
You sit right here.

24:08.814 --> 24:10.213
You're up.

24:16.154 --> 24:17.212
Drink it!

24:17.255 --> 24:19.120
Drink! Drink! Drink!

24:21.626 --> 24:23.253
Yeah!

24:24.496 --> 24:26.157
Drinking it up.

24:26.198 --> 24:30.294
And here's more familiar faces:
the host Brandon Walsh.

24:30.335 --> 24:31.734
Go big or go home, kids.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.770
And his lovely girlfriend,
Susan.

24:35.807 --> 24:39.208
I'm just an appendage,
that's all.

24:39.244 --> 24:42.577
Ooh, and Clare Arnold,

24:42.614 --> 24:44.479
a finer roommate
one could not have.

24:44.516 --> 24:45.710
Hey, remember
you still owe me

24:45.750 --> 24:46.774
a bottle of
hair conditioner.

24:46.818 --> 24:48.752
Right, yeah.

24:48.787 --> 24:50.982
And my personal favorite,

24:51.089 --> 24:53.148
- Joe Bradley.
- The guy who's just itching

24:53.191 --> 24:54.658
to dance with his girlfriend.

24:54.693 --> 24:56.718
Um, yeah, I'll get back
to you on that one.

24:56.761 --> 24:59.025
We just have a few more
people to interview, okay?

25:00.532 --> 25:02.261
Hey, Donna.

25:02.300 --> 25:03.892
Aren't you carrying this
a little too far?

25:03.935 --> 25:05.926
I want to have
a good time tonight, too.

25:05.971 --> 25:07.939
Yeah, we will. We will.

25:08.039 --> 25:09.870
Hey, it's one for posterity.

25:09.908 --> 25:11.967
Not to mention
late night television, ha!

25:19.818 --> 25:22.651
- Oh.
- Yeah, you'll see.

25:24.155 --> 25:25.884
- Pig in a blanket?
- Oh, why, thanks.

25:28.894 --> 25:30.919
You might want to take
a napkin with those.

25:30.962 --> 25:33.260
They can get
just a little greasy.

25:33.298 --> 25:35.027
All righty. Here.

25:37.502 --> 25:39.333
- Thank you.
- Thanks, bro.

25:40.705 --> 25:41.672
Enjoy your weenies.

25:41.706 --> 25:43.833
- Thanks.
- Okay.

25:47.879 --> 25:50.643
Hey...

25:50.682 --> 25:52.843
- What happened to our drinks?
- I don't know.

26:10.302 --> 26:11.530
- Hey, Brandon?
- Yeah?

26:11.570 --> 26:12.696
Will you take over?

26:12.737 --> 26:14.204
Take over what?

26:14.239 --> 26:15.900
You know.

26:17.142 --> 26:20.600
Hey, how about
that dance now?

26:20.645 --> 26:23.273
I was thinking of
playing hard to get.

26:23.315 --> 26:26.148
Yeah? How hard?

26:28.486 --> 26:30.317
I give up. Let's dance.

26:31.957 --> 26:34.357
Feel like we're walking
into a lion's den?

26:34.392 --> 26:36.292
Yeah, yeah.

26:36.328 --> 26:38.626
Then again I, uh...

26:38.663 --> 26:40.688
I survived L.A. County jail.

26:40.732 --> 26:42.393
This could be worse.

26:42.434 --> 26:44.868
Yeah, well, uh, if
there's a guy in there

26:44.903 --> 26:47.303
about six-five,
250 pounds with a tattoo

26:47.339 --> 26:49.170
on his forehead that
says "Mama's Boy,"

26:49.207 --> 26:50.799
you'll let me know, right?

26:50.842 --> 26:52.810
Maybe.

26:52.844 --> 26:54.573
I can't believe you
talked me into this.

26:58.016 --> 27:00.314
- Hey, guys. Welcome.
- Hey.

27:00.352 --> 27:01.580
- Hi.
- How are you doing, Colin?

27:01.620 --> 27:02.678
I'm all right.

27:02.721 --> 27:03.847
- Thanks for asking.
- Good.

27:03.888 --> 27:05.753
Look, uh, have a good
time tonight, huh?

27:05.790 --> 27:07.781
- Okay.
- Bye.

27:09.961 --> 27:12.623
Well, looks like
it won't be too bad.

27:13.798 --> 27:15.459
We'll see.

27:19.270 --> 27:20.464
Drink! Drink! Drink!

27:20.505 --> 27:21.870
Drink it!

27:21.906 --> 27:23.635
Drink! Drink! Drink!

27:26.144 --> 27:27.941
This dude's
on his ninth shot.

27:27.979 --> 27:29.776
No sign of shutdown.

27:29.814 --> 27:31.304
What a rock.

27:32.484 --> 27:33.610
Hey, Muntz.

27:33.652 --> 27:34.710
We're back in this round.

27:34.753 --> 27:36.687
You guys already had
your one turn, scram.

27:36.721 --> 27:38.951
What is this?
You go to college

27:38.990 --> 27:41.220
and you turn into
a total wuss?

27:41.259 --> 27:42.817
Why don't you two
give it up already

27:42.861 --> 27:44.089
and go play some pinball
with the kiddies?

27:44.129 --> 27:45.096
Oh, man, come on.

27:45.130 --> 27:46.757
This is our first
college party.

27:46.798 --> 27:48.288
We're here
to make memories.

27:48.333 --> 27:49.630
You're breaking my heart.

27:49.668 --> 27:51.465
Get lost.

27:51.503 --> 27:56.702
Maybe some cash would change
the climate here, sir.

27:56.741 --> 27:57.969
Nah, beat it.

27:58.043 --> 27:59.670
Bye-bye.

28:07.152 --> 28:09.916
- Kelly.
- Colin.

28:09.954 --> 28:12.286
Uh, I'll go get us
some drinks.

28:15.960 --> 28:17.222
I'm glad to see you.

28:17.262 --> 28:19.753
- You are?
- Yeah.

28:19.798 --> 28:21.925
I know you've had a hard time.

28:22.033 --> 28:23.933
Yeah.

28:24.035 --> 28:26.435
You could say
it hasn't been my week.

28:26.471 --> 28:28.701
Or month
or year for that matter.

28:28.740 --> 28:31.607
It must have been terrible.

28:31.643 --> 28:33.702
Yeah, it was.

28:33.745 --> 28:36.509
And it looks like
I'm going back, too.

28:36.548 --> 28:38.778
I'm sorry.

28:38.817 --> 28:41.445
It's not your problem.

28:41.486 --> 28:43.647
Look, all I'm hoping
to get from you is forgiveness.

28:45.490 --> 28:47.355
I'm working on that.

28:51.996 --> 28:53.258
Have fun.

28:53.298 --> 28:55.198
Thanks.

29:26.131 --> 29:28.122
We have liftoff.

29:43.615 --> 29:45.640
Mmm.

29:45.683 --> 29:47.480
I have to admit,
I'm already having

29:47.519 --> 29:49.111
a lot more fun
than I thought possible.

29:49.154 --> 29:50.451
What did I tell you?

29:50.488 --> 29:52.251
I just hope that nobody
talks to me long enough

29:52.290 --> 29:54.349
to find out that I haven't
even finished high school.

29:54.392 --> 29:55.552
Uh, somehow I don't think

29:55.593 --> 29:57.754
they're going to ask
you for your diploma.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.127
Ooh, sorry.

30:00.165 --> 30:01.689
What's up?

30:07.505 --> 30:10.303
Hey! Hey, not so fast,
pencil necks.

30:10.341 --> 30:12.241
Hey, Muntz.

30:12.277 --> 30:13.835
We're just trying
to help clean up, big guy.

30:13.878 --> 30:15.209
Yeah, you know, that is

30:15.246 --> 30:16.736
of course, you know
if you're done with these.

30:21.486 --> 30:23.511
Okay. Cool.

30:37.602 --> 30:39.433
You know, if you
hold it in a towel,

30:39.470 --> 30:41.665
you'll get
a steadier frame.

30:41.706 --> 30:43.367
Wait, you know something
about cameras?

30:43.408 --> 30:44.534
It's kind of my hobby.

30:44.576 --> 30:45.736
That's great, Tara.

30:45.777 --> 30:48.007
- Thanks.
- All right, Donna.

30:48.046 --> 30:49.536
We're ready to rock.

30:53.084 --> 30:54.210
Welcome back to party central

30:54.252 --> 30:56.015
at the Annual KEG House
Spring Fling.

30:56.120 --> 30:57.951
Sanders goes
for the long pass.

30:57.989 --> 30:59.581
The toss is phenomenal.

30:59.624 --> 31:01.023
In slo-mo now...

31:01.059 --> 31:02.856
Hey, guys, guys, guys,
there's a reason

31:02.894 --> 31:04.555
why they don't make
footballs out of glass.

31:05.663 --> 31:07.324
Hey, who's the buzz kill?

31:07.365 --> 31:11.529
Oh, yes, Steve Sanders also
has family here.

31:11.569 --> 31:13.833
Yeah, I admit it, these are
my brothers, the monkey boys,

31:13.872 --> 31:15.965
more fondly known
as Ryan and Austin.

31:16.007 --> 31:17.338
Hi.

31:17.375 --> 31:18.967
It's off to work we go.

31:19.043 --> 31:21.739
Did I mention
they're half-brothers?

31:26.017 --> 31:28.986
Well, Steve, I guess
it's safe to say your brothers

31:29.087 --> 31:30.714
- are in the bag.
- Yeah, I'll say.

31:30.755 --> 31:33.246
Wait, they're only teenagers.
Should we be worried?

31:33.291 --> 31:35.088
Nah, they're not driving.

31:35.126 --> 31:36.991
What's the big deal?
I got drunk when I was 17.

31:37.028 --> 31:40.361
Oh right, Steve,
that explains it.

31:41.733 --> 31:44.361
Oh, oh, you guys are angels.

31:44.402 --> 31:46.393
Well, maybe you, Donna,
but, David, you're no saint.

31:54.612 --> 31:57.376
Hey, you can come in
on one condition:

31:57.415 --> 31:58.848
you've got to do
a video greeting.

31:58.883 --> 32:00.475
All right, if you say so.

32:00.518 --> 32:03.578
Uh, roses are red,
violets are blue,

32:03.621 --> 32:05.885
we've never met,
but how do you do?

32:07.158 --> 32:09.251
Thanks.

32:09.294 --> 32:10.283
- Hey.
- Hey, Tara.

32:10.328 --> 32:11.317
- Come on in.
- You look fabulous.

32:11.362 --> 32:12.829
Thank you.

32:12.864 --> 32:14.331
Kelly's been looking for you.

32:14.365 --> 32:15.957
Oh, she can call off
the search dogs.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.627
- Ruff, ruff.
- Hey.

32:18.670 --> 32:19.932
I'm sorry, I'm very late.

32:19.971 --> 32:21.461
I noticed.

32:21.506 --> 32:23.235
I went home and changed
first. I'm sorry.

32:23.274 --> 32:24.468
Well, yes.

32:24.509 --> 32:26.340
I'm used to seeing you
in your white coat

32:26.377 --> 32:27.708
- that I like so much.
- It's in the car.

32:27.745 --> 32:29.508
I can go put it back on
if you feel more comfortable.

32:29.547 --> 32:31.139
No, maybe later.

32:31.182 --> 32:33.309
- You want to dance?
- Sure, I can do that.

33:23.634 --> 33:25.602
Steve!

33:25.636 --> 33:27.103
- Come quick.
- After this song, man.

33:27.138 --> 33:28.162
It's Ryan, man, he's sick.

33:28.206 --> 33:28.968
He's really sick.

33:29.007 --> 33:29.974
Well, where is he?

33:30.041 --> 33:31.167
On the back porch.

33:31.209 --> 33:33.200
He's out cold, Steve.

33:41.853 --> 33:43.377
Oh, great.

33:43.421 --> 33:44.945
- Get up!
- Let me see him,

33:44.989 --> 33:47.423
I'm a med student.

33:47.458 --> 33:49.323
Kelly, call 911.

33:49.360 --> 33:51.988
How much has this kid
had to drink tonight?

33:52.096 --> 33:53.996
I don't know. A lot.

33:54.065 --> 33:55.999
Too much blood in his alcohol
stream. Come on!

33:56.100 --> 33:57.658
We've gotta get him
to the hospital right away.

33:57.702 --> 33:58.760
- He's just drunk.
- Yeah,

33:58.803 --> 33:59.997
I'll say.
He has alcohol poisoning.

34:00.071 --> 34:01.095
- What's that mean?
- It means

34:01.139 --> 34:02.163
we've gotta get
his stomach pumped

34:02.206 --> 34:03.833
and reduce the concentration
of alcohol in his blood

34:03.875 --> 34:04.899
before something drastic
happens.

34:04.942 --> 34:07.843
Drastic? You mean he could
die from this?

34:33.004 --> 34:34.972
You were
wonderful tonight.

34:35.005 --> 34:36.974
I was?

34:37.007 --> 34:38.635
Yeah, yeah,
I never thought

34:38.676 --> 34:40.906
I would have had a good time
tonight, but I did.

34:40.945 --> 34:41.969
I actually forgot

34:42.080 --> 34:43.672
about all the horrible
things in my life

34:43.714 --> 34:46.877
and enjoyed myself
for a couple hours.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.978
It's all because of you.

34:51.089 --> 34:53.080
Are you sure about that?

34:54.525 --> 34:57.494
'Cause I saw the way you
and Kelly were together.

34:57.528 --> 34:59.496
Valerie,

34:59.530 --> 35:01.657
you know there's
no call for that.

35:01.699 --> 35:03.690
No, I don't know.

35:03.734 --> 35:05.827
It made me feel terrible.

35:05.870 --> 35:07.861
I'm sorry.

35:08.873 --> 35:10.841
I had no idea.

35:10.875 --> 35:12.240
Of course, you didn't.

35:12.276 --> 35:14.471
Because all you ever think
about is yourself.

35:14.512 --> 35:15.604
That's not true.

35:15.646 --> 35:16.635
It is true.

35:16.681 --> 35:17.875
You know, I'm beginning to think

35:17.915 --> 35:19.542
that you fall in love
with any female body

35:19.584 --> 35:20.778
that keeps you afloat.

35:22.820 --> 35:25.482
Valerie!

35:27.091 --> 35:28.558
What?

35:28.593 --> 35:32.962
I love you, okay?

35:32.997 --> 35:34.965
Not because you bailed me out.

35:34.999 --> 35:37.991
Not because of some fancy lawyer
you're paying for.

35:39.437 --> 35:41.428
I love you because of you.

35:44.575 --> 35:45.974
Are you sure?

35:46.043 --> 35:47.567
I'm positive.

35:47.612 --> 35:50.274
I hope so.

35:50.314 --> 35:52.475
Because I love you...

35:53.518 --> 35:56.351
...and I always have.

35:56.387 --> 35:59.356
And I've never risked so much
for anyone before.

36:02.760 --> 36:04.728
Yeah.

36:04.762 --> 36:06.753
Yeah, I love you.

36:06.797 --> 36:08.765
I'm positive.

36:08.799 --> 36:11.267
You hear me?

36:11.302 --> 36:13.293
Yeah.

36:18.176 --> 36:21.805
Trauma team to IC stat.

36:21.846 --> 36:23.473
Excuse me, excuse me.

36:23.514 --> 36:24.708
My name is Sanders,
I'm looking for my...

36:24.749 --> 36:25.716
Dad.

36:25.750 --> 36:27.047
What happened?

36:27.084 --> 36:28.381
What happened?
Where's Ryan?

36:28.419 --> 36:30.046
They're transferring him
from the ER

36:30.087 --> 36:31.315
to intensive care right now.

36:31.355 --> 36:33.152
He's gonna be okay, isn't he?

36:33.191 --> 36:34.715
I haven't heard
from the doctors yet.

36:34.759 --> 36:36.659
But there was a med student
at the party,

36:36.694 --> 36:37.820
and the paramedics came...

36:37.862 --> 36:41.298
I don't want to hear
any more from you.

36:42.366 --> 36:43.958
Nothing.

36:44.068 --> 36:47.094
How in the hell could you let
something like this happen?

36:49.140 --> 36:51.267
Oh, God, what if he dies?

36:51.309 --> 36:54.278
Come on, let's, um,

36:54.312 --> 36:56.610
let's get something
from the vending machine.

36:56.647 --> 36:58.638
Yeah.

37:00.952 --> 37:02.920
That was quite an evening.

37:02.954 --> 37:05.752
Yeah, Steve has a knack
for throwing parties

37:05.790 --> 37:07.758
that end with paramedics.

37:07.792 --> 37:09.259
Maybe he should stop
throwing parties.

37:09.293 --> 37:11.261
Yeah, sounds like
a good idea to me.

37:11.295 --> 37:13.058
I felt for that kid.

37:13.097 --> 37:14.223
The way he overdid it.

37:14.265 --> 37:15.789
That could have
easily been me.

37:15.833 --> 37:17.824
Hmm, or me.

37:20.304 --> 37:23.273
Well, thanks for everything.

37:23.307 --> 37:24.365
I'm glad you were there.

37:24.408 --> 37:25.432
It's no problem.

37:25.476 --> 37:27.103
Let's go in, Kelly.

37:27.144 --> 37:28.338
I'm cold.

37:28.379 --> 37:29.403
- Well...
- Yeah.

37:29.447 --> 37:30.573
- good night.
- Night.

37:30.615 --> 37:32.583
Wait.

37:34.018 --> 37:35.246
Greg...

37:35.286 --> 37:36.446
I'll go in.

37:37.655 --> 37:39.646
You guys enjoy
the night.

37:46.998 --> 37:49.967
I'd really like to hear
how Ryan's doing.

37:50.001 --> 37:51.628
Yeah?

37:51.669 --> 37:53.466
Well, I could call
you tomorrow.

37:53.504 --> 37:54.630
That'd be good.

37:54.672 --> 37:55.661
Good.

37:55.706 --> 37:57.697
Yeah.

38:16.961 --> 38:18.952
You bitch!

38:44.288 --> 38:47.257
Inhalation therapist to ER.

38:47.291 --> 38:49.282
Inhalation therapist
to ER.

38:49.327 --> 38:51.124
- Mr. Sanders?
- Yes.

38:51.162 --> 38:52.459
Yes.

38:52.496 --> 38:54.487
Ryan seems to be doing better.

38:54.532 --> 38:56.625
We got a lot of the alcohol
out of his stomach

38:56.667 --> 38:57.964
and we've pumped him
full of saline.

38:58.002 --> 39:00.869
I think he'll be okay.

39:00.905 --> 39:02.202
Thank you,
and thank God.

39:02.239 --> 39:03.604
- Is-ls he awake?
- No,

39:03.641 --> 39:05.040
he's gonna be out
for a while.

39:05.076 --> 39:06.907
But we removed the air
tube from his throat.

39:06.944 --> 39:08.571
That should give him
a little more comfort.

39:08.612 --> 39:09.670
Yeah.

39:09.714 --> 39:10.840
You'll let us know

39:10.881 --> 39:12.849
- when we can see him, right?
- I sure will.

39:12.883 --> 39:14.874
Thank you, doctor.

39:17.555 --> 39:21.355
I'm gonna go wander
the hall, okay?

39:26.130 --> 39:28.655
What is wrong with you?

39:28.699 --> 39:29.825
Me?

39:29.867 --> 39:30.925
I didn't do anything.

39:31.001 --> 39:32.559
I left you responsible.

39:32.603 --> 39:34.230
Dad, I kept an eye on him.

39:34.271 --> 39:36.831
How was I supposed to know
he was gonna get so tanked?

39:36.874 --> 39:38.865
Oh, Steven...

39:40.678 --> 39:43.306
Don't you know that you
and your brothers

39:43.347 --> 39:46.145
are the most important things
in the whole world to me?

39:46.183 --> 39:48.879
I count on you to look

39:48.919 --> 39:50.147
after each other.

39:50.187 --> 39:51.586
In the end, that's all
that matters to me,

39:51.622 --> 39:52.953
is that you look
after each other,

39:52.990 --> 39:54.651
that you take care of each
other, that you stick together.

39:55.693 --> 39:58.287
I know. I'm sorry.

40:05.970 --> 40:08.598
He's gonna be all right.

40:08.639 --> 40:10.630
It's okay.

40:20.751 --> 40:22.378
Where are you going?

40:22.420 --> 40:24.411
I'm gonna go check on Ryan.

40:32.663 --> 40:34.460
All right, Austin.

40:34.498 --> 40:36.466
- No, no more. No...
- Come on.

40:36.500 --> 40:38.161
- Come on, you gotta have more.
- I'm sober.

40:38.202 --> 40:39.499
I promise.

40:39.537 --> 40:41.198
Maybe you want to go up
to bed then, hmm?

40:41.238 --> 40:42.603
How can I go to bed?

40:42.640 --> 40:43.834
I had too much coffee.

40:43.874 --> 40:46.001
I gotta go with him on that one.

40:47.545 --> 40:50.173
When are we gonna hear something
about my brother?

41:02.026 --> 41:03.960
Hello.

41:04.061 --> 41:06.427
Oh, hi.

41:06.464 --> 41:09.627
Really? Oh, okay.

41:09.667 --> 41:11.635
That's great news.

41:11.669 --> 41:13.637
Cool, yeah, we'll be here.

41:13.671 --> 41:14.831
Okay, bye.

41:14.872 --> 41:16.965
That was Clare.

41:17.041 --> 41:18.167
Your brother Ryan

41:18.209 --> 41:19.801
is out of danger,
he's gonna be okay.

41:19.844 --> 41:21.072
Steve's in
with him now.

41:21.111 --> 41:22.476
- I gotta see him.
- Nah.

41:22.513 --> 41:23.980
You'll see him tomorrow.
All you gotta do

41:24.081 --> 41:25.708
is go to bed now, man.

41:25.749 --> 41:26.943
You're right.

41:26.984 --> 41:27.973
I'm tired.

41:28.052 --> 41:28.984
- Good night.
- Good night.

41:29.086 --> 41:30.451
Good night.

41:30.488 --> 41:32.479
You know...

41:33.891 --> 41:35.882
...we're lucky nothing
worse happened.

41:35.926 --> 41:37.860
I know. Poor Steve.

41:37.895 --> 41:40.193
Yeah.

42:07.758 --> 42:09.783
I'm glad to see
your eyes are open.

42:09.827 --> 42:12.625
How long have I been out?

42:14.398 --> 42:17.390
Last thing I remember...

42:18.636 --> 42:20.627
- I must've passed out.

42:20.671 --> 42:22.468
Well, let me fill in the blanks
for you.

42:22.506 --> 42:24.064
You ruined the party.

42:24.108 --> 42:27.236
You got me in massive
trouble with Dad.

42:27.278 --> 42:30.247
You're a screw up and an idiot,

42:30.281 --> 42:34.308
but you're my brother
and I love you.

42:37.755 --> 42:39.746
Thanks, Steve.

42:39.790 --> 42:41.621
You're welcome.

42:43.661 --> 42:48.360
Hey, you think I'm gonna
have a hangover?

42:48.399 --> 42:50.765
I think you're gonna
have the "Guinness Book

42:50.801 --> 42:52.792
of World Records" hangover.

42:57.508 --> 42:59.806
Yeah.

42:59.843 --> 43:01.834
Mmm, I'm pretty sleepy.

43:01.879 --> 43:03.506
Yeah.

43:03.547 --> 43:06.175
Okay, little brother, rest.

43:06.216 --> 43:08.207
I'll be right here.

43:10.120 --> 43:11.087
Excuse me.

43:11.121 --> 43:12.520
You really need to be going now.

43:12.556 --> 43:14.183
Ma'am, I'd like to stay.

43:14.224 --> 43:15.521
That's my brother.

43:17.094 --> 43:19.062
Okay.

43:19.096 --> 43:20.256
Thank you.
