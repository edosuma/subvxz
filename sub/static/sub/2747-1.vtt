02:23.640 --> 02:27.122
I was born in Yuma, Arizona
in a ranch owned by my family

02:27.200 --> 02:29.601
but we lost it in the depression.

02:30.640 --> 02:34.850
Like many other families, we moved
to California to work in the fields.

02:34.960 --> 02:38.442
<i>But when we arrived, we found out that
there was more people than jobs.</i>

02:38.560 --> 02:42.724
<i>We went from being farm owners
to farm workers in one day.</i>

02:43.840 --> 02:47.242
<i>And at the age of 11,
I started working in the fields.</i>

02:47.960 --> 02:50.088
<i>That's where I witnessed,
for the first time,</i>

02:50.160 --> 02:54.006
<i>the injustice and the indignities
suffered by the farm workers.</i>

02:54.840 --> 02:58.447
<i>You see the problem is that in 1936
the country changed,</i>

02:59.160 --> 03:01.811
<i>because the National Labor Relations Act
went into effect.</i>

03:02.200 --> 03:06.728
And it gave most workers the right
to join the union and bargain collectively.

03:07.320 --> 03:09.209
Except the farm workers,

03:09.280 --> 03:13.763
they were excluded from this protection
and I was one of them.

03:13.880 --> 03:18.602
I wanted to do something, so I joined
the CSO, Community Services Organization.

03:19.040 --> 03:21.202
And that is where I learned
how to organize people.

03:22.800 --> 03:26.088
<i>We were working in the cities and I
realized that, to make a difference,</i>

03:26.160 --> 03:29.243
<i>I had to get out
and start organizing the workers.</i>

03:29.320 --> 03:33.405
<i>So, in 1962, I went back
to the fields to do just that.</i>

04:36.320 --> 04:38.163
Juan de la Cruz!

04:40.720 --> 04:43.405
I'm a friend of your cousin, Felipe.

04:50.320 --> 04:51.446
Are you Juan?

04:51.960 --> 04:53.121
Can we talk?

04:53.480 --> 04:55.926
Sure. But not here.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.480
I'm done in about four hours.

05:12.160 --> 05:15.130
You need to leave now. They're coming.

05:23.080 --> 05:27.290
Can I help you, sir?
Were you talking to those workers?

05:27.560 --> 05:30.166
Is there something I can do for you?

05:31.320 --> 05:32.924
I'm talking to you.

05:39.880 --> 05:42.121
Do you own anything?

05:46.960 --> 05:47.961
No.

05:50.720 --> 05:53.087
Can you read or write?

05:56.760 --> 05:58.205
Well... No.

05:58.920 --> 06:00.331
Of course not.

06:07.720 --> 06:10.087
Who in your family works?

06:14.640 --> 06:17.120
Me and my wife.

06:18.160 --> 06:22.245
And my kids. The older ones anyways.

06:23.640 --> 06:26.120
The other ones are still too young.

06:28.760 --> 06:31.161
Do you want more for your kids?

06:33.000 --> 06:34.684
Of course.

06:37.280 --> 06:38.611
But...

06:39.800 --> 06:46.081
Most of the people are afraid.

06:48.080 --> 06:51.323
They have to feed their kids.

06:58.480 --> 07:01.324
It's not easy doing it alone.

07:04.120 --> 07:08.808
I'll return in one month
to help you start organizing.

07:09.320 --> 07:12.369
But I need you to gather
everyone you can here.

07:17.280 --> 07:18.770
OK, that's fine.

07:19.800 --> 07:22.451
And you won't be alone anymore.

07:25.120 --> 07:26.963
If we want to organize farm workers,
if we're really serious,

07:27.040 --> 07:28.720
it's not gonna happen here, not with them.

07:29.040 --> 07:33.489
It's just one setback, Cesar, it takes a while
to build trust, you have to be patient.

07:33.560 --> 07:35.528
You know, they really don't care about
the farm worker, Fred.

07:35.640 --> 07:36.641
Gilbert, that's not true.

07:36.720 --> 07:40.088
See that's what I'm talking about, Fred,
see I have to be where it's happening.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.891
I have to get out of Los Angeles
and go back to the fields where I started.

07:42.960 --> 07:44.883
You know, we are doing this together, okay?

07:44.960 --> 07:47.122
You knew this could happen,
that is why we have a plan.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.086
But not in an office.

07:49.160 --> 07:50.446
It's not the time to walk out now.

07:50.520 --> 07:52.124
You know what it takes,
that is why I brought you in.

07:52.240 --> 07:55.687
The CSO will be behind you, no matter what,
but please at least sleep on it.

07:55.800 --> 07:57.006
I am not tired, Fred.

07:58.080 --> 07:59.570
I want to get my hands dirty.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.971
- Cesar...
- I'm with him. He's right.

08:05.120 --> 08:07.646
You will go to new schools
and make new friends.

08:09.160 --> 08:11.208
You're going to be fine.

08:12.240 --> 08:13.890
Your father and I grew up on the fields.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.450
Which team plays for Delano?

08:15.520 --> 08:21.368
Your tio Ruc and tia Petra live in Delano,
so do our cousins. It's gonna be good.

08:21.840 --> 08:23.569
Okay, let's take a vote.

08:24.080 --> 08:26.162
Who wants to go to Delano?

08:37.400 --> 08:39.562
<i>...a wonderful day
in Southern California.</i>

08:39.679 --> 08:41.568
<i>- Sandy Koufax on the mound.
- No!</i>

08:41.679 --> 08:44.650
<i>Sandy coming off that
beautiful no-hitter last week.</i>

08:45.120 --> 08:47.805
<i>Caullison just waving that bat
back and forth.</i>

08:47.920 --> 08:49.888
<i>- Pare,</i> I <i>am trying</i> to listen to <i>the game.
- Koufax trying to keep</i>

08:49.960 --> 08:51.121
<i>his winning streak going.</i>

08:51.200 --> 08:53.931
Could you stop? Stop!

08:58.320 --> 09:01.085
<i>Top of the fourth,
Dodgers leading two to nothing.</i>

09:01.400 --> 09:05.928
<i>Koufax delivers and it's
a line drive down the left field line...</i>

09:06.040 --> 09:07.087
<i>Fair ball!</i>

09:13.280 --> 09:15.601
I can't hear. Can you turn it up?

09:16.200 --> 09:18.726
I think we, uh, lost the signal.

09:20.920 --> 09:22.206
You promised me a three-bedroom house.

09:22.280 --> 09:23.884
I said I would try, Mansi.
It was short notice.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.040
But I gave you two months.

09:25.400 --> 09:26.526
That's short notice!

09:26.600 --> 09:27.840
Uncle Cesar.

09:28.040 --> 09:30.520
- That goes in the bedroom, Chato.
- It doesn't fit.

09:30.600 --> 09:31.647
It doesn't fit.

09:31.720 --> 09:33.609
Hey, Cesar, we've lived in a lot worse.

09:33.680 --> 09:34.681
We'll be fine.

09:34.800 --> 09:36.086
Can you get the heavy stuff
in the truck please?

09:37.280 --> 09:40.250
If you put eight kids in that one car,
you can put them in that house!

09:40.840 --> 09:42.683
We can find a bigger one
in a couple of months.

09:42.800 --> 09:44.882
And then we gotta
move all over again?

10:12.280 --> 10:14.123
Forty-eight, forty-nine,

10:15.000 --> 10:16.490
fifty, fifty-one,

10:17.320 --> 10:18.685
fifty-two,

10:19.360 --> 10:20.725
fifty-three!

10:22.200 --> 10:23.201
That's all for today!

10:23.760 --> 10:25.921
I hear they are looking for bodies
at the onion fields.

10:54.040 --> 10:56.008
I found the same thing in Hanford.

10:56.640 --> 10:58.369
The workers are scared.

10:59.080 --> 11:03.449
Then we need to hold twice as many
house meetings than we did in Selma.

11:13.080 --> 11:15.447
- What's the matter?
- It's my back.

11:19.560 --> 11:21.210
You can't take real work anymore.

11:21.280 --> 11:23.362
It hurts even when I don't work.

11:23.440 --> 11:25.363
You should take it easy.

11:25.840 --> 11:28.764
What, and live on just
what Helen makes? No.

11:29.080 --> 11:32.289
We are going to make the kids work
on the weekends now.

11:37.320 --> 11:39.084
but she went and told everybody
at the church,

11:39.200 --> 11:40.565
and now everybody has...

11:41.080 --> 11:42.127
Look who is here.

11:42.760 --> 11:44.364
And very dirty.

11:45.320 --> 11:46.845
Did you walk here from Oxnard?

11:46.920 --> 11:47.967
Ola.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.641
I thought maybe you weren't coming back.

11:50.040 --> 11:52.042
- It's only been two weeks.
- It's been 18 days.

11:52.120 --> 11:53.121
Eighteen days...

11:53.920 --> 11:54.921
Cesar.

11:56.080 --> 11:57.127
Dolores!

11:58.840 --> 12:02.208
Look at you.
You definitely got your hands dirty.

12:02.800 --> 12:05.121
This is Angela. Say, "Hi, Cesar."

12:05.200 --> 12:06.531
Hey, mamita.

12:06.840 --> 12:07.841
I'm gonna put her to bed.

12:07.920 --> 12:09.729
How long are you guys visiting us?

12:09.800 --> 12:12.724
Oh, well, word is you can't
do this without me, so...

12:14.000 --> 12:15.081
You are staying?

12:15.200 --> 12:19.046
Well, of course. You think I'm going to
let you mess up what you've started here?

12:19.120 --> 12:22.806
But before you do anything,
you need to go talk to Fernando.

12:26.320 --> 12:28.004
I need to go talk to Fernando?

12:29.400 --> 12:30.447
Okay.

12:52.680 --> 12:53.806
Hi, Poli.

12:58.200 --> 12:59.884
What happened to your eye?

13:00.280 --> 13:01.486
Nothing.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.287
You wanna talk about this nothing?

13:07.360 --> 13:08.486
Nope.

13:13.320 --> 13:15.368
The kids here are idiots.

13:17.120 --> 13:19.009
They hate us, you know?

13:20.840 --> 13:23.605
<i>They came up on me and Chats,
a bunch of them.</i>

13:25.000 --> 13:27.480
They wouldn't stop calling us "beaners."

13:27.600 --> 13:30.809
Beaners? Is that the best they got?

13:33.360 --> 13:35.488
I've been called much worse.

13:38.520 --> 13:40.010
<i>â€œGreaser,</i>

13:41.600 --> 13:42.601
"wetback,

13:44.440 --> 13:45.646
"spic."

13:45.920 --> 13:48.287
That one doesn't even make sense.

13:48.960 --> 13:49.961
"Brown nigger."

13:50.840 --> 13:52.569
I never heard that one.

13:52.640 --> 13:53.721
Uh-huh.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.484
I learned a lot in the Navy.

13:58.040 --> 13:59.883
Here, put this on your eye.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.330
Who started it?

14:06.120 --> 14:08.009
I told you, they started calling us names.

14:08.360 --> 14:09.725
No, who started the fight?

14:12.200 --> 14:13.247
We didn't have a choice.

14:14.160 --> 14:16.162
You always have a choice.

14:20.640 --> 14:22.722
I knew you wouldn't get it.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.682
<i>although the
official military word is that</i>

14:41.760 --> 14:43.808
<i>these are only mopping up operations,</i>

14:43.920 --> 14:45.684
<i>in five separate actions...</i>

14:45.760 --> 14:48.047
We need to bring the
people together, like a convention.

14:48.120 --> 14:50.122
We need to get
everybody together in one place

14:50.240 --> 14:51.924
so they can see how strong we are.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.968
We should start a credit union.

14:54.080 --> 14:55.605
To loan people money?

14:55.680 --> 14:58.361
It'll give us credibility
and it will help people during the winter.

14:59.080 --> 15:01.606
<i>Hey, remember me? Eli Ordonez.</i>

15:02.080 --> 15:04.287
I saw you in Salinas at that other meeting
you were doing.

15:04.360 --> 15:06.442
If you want, I can help pass those around.

15:06.840 --> 15:09.286
I have a cousin who has no papers.

15:09.400 --> 15:11.129
You tell your cousin,
if he works in the fields,

15:11.200 --> 15:13.248
he has the right to representation.

15:15.600 --> 15:17.443
What is happening here in Delano

15:17.760 --> 15:20.286
is the same thing that is happening
in Salinas or in Stockton.

15:21.080 --> 15:23.924
If we don't get organized,
the bosses are going to treat us like...

15:24.000 --> 15:25.331
Excuse me.

15:25.960 --> 15:27.166
Who are you?

15:28.400 --> 15:29.481
Cesar Chavez.

15:37.440 --> 15:38.680
How much are you
asking for, Chucho?

15:39.040 --> 15:40.326
Twenty-five dollars.

15:41.120 --> 15:42.246
How about 10, Chucho?

15:42.320 --> 15:44.561
Look at all these other people
who also want money.

15:46.200 --> 15:47.640
My daughter has some questionnaires.

15:47.840 --> 15:49.922
We want to know what concerns you.

15:50.120 --> 15:51.451
Come on, just do that for us.

16:01.640 --> 16:06.441
Here, people can put messages
to their family, or anyone, it's free.

16:08.640 --> 16:10.563
Want to see the union paper?

16:41.800 --> 16:43.165
Sheriff, every night this goes on.

16:43.240 --> 16:44.920
And I have to tell my husband to rush home

16:44.960 --> 16:46.928
because I'm frightened
about what is going on over there.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.650
We are decent folk
and don't want any trouble.

16:48.720 --> 16:51.371
I'm terrified for my children
and who knows where...

16:51.440 --> 16:54.444
Okay... Okay... Ladies... Ladies...
Let me make sure I understand this.

16:54.520 --> 16:56.841
- You say they get together every night?
- Every night.

16:56.920 --> 16:57.921
And there is 50 of them?

16:58.000 --> 17:00.480
Fifty-seven. I count 57.

17:01.360 --> 17:02.486
Fifty-seven?

17:11.920 --> 17:13.080
Mr. Chavez?

17:14.760 --> 17:15.886
Yes?

17:15.960 --> 17:17.200
How are you doin' today?

17:17.280 --> 17:19.601
Fine. How can I help you?

17:19.960 --> 17:21.450
I just wanted to introduce myself.

17:21.560 --> 17:23.040
- I'm Sheriff...
- I know who you are.

17:26.119 --> 17:28.771
You seem to be gathering quite a crowd.

17:29.560 --> 17:30.681
Is there a law against that?

17:31.200 --> 17:33.601
No, not really.

17:34.640 --> 17:37.484
But I would like to ask you some questions

17:37.960 --> 17:41.407
about some of the people around you
and their affiliations.

17:41.680 --> 17:42.841
Affiliations to what?

17:43.640 --> 17:45.449
Let's say the communist party.

17:45.960 --> 17:47.564
- Communists?
- Yes.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.009
Do you mind tellin' me what's so funny?

17:56.320 --> 17:58.129
It's that we are Catholic.

17:58.720 --> 18:00.131
How can Catholics be communists?

18:02.160 --> 18:03.969
I've seen stranger things.

18:04.200 --> 18:06.931
Mr. Chavez, do you mind
if we take a look around?

18:08.240 --> 18:09.401
Do you have a warrant?

18:14.000 --> 18:15.081
Not on me.

18:16.120 --> 18:17.485
So you're asking me for a favor?

18:18.080 --> 18:19.681
I think you'd be doing yourself a favor.

18:20.920 --> 18:23.491
Come on. There's nothing to see here.

18:24.640 --> 18:25.846
Come in.

18:27.120 --> 18:28.610
We have nothing to hide.

18:28.760 --> 18:31.161
So what they doin' here?

18:31.960 --> 18:33.640
You givin' away free pinatas or something?

18:34.560 --> 18:35.766
It's a credit union.

18:37.640 --> 18:38.721
No shit.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.206
Where's the money coming from?

18:40.280 --> 18:41.566
Donations.

18:45.760 --> 18:47.205
Here's a box if you're interested.

18:58.600 --> 19:01.444
I don't know exactly what you're up to here

19:01.960 --> 19:03.962
but the citizens of Delano,

19:04.320 --> 19:06.607
they don't care much for subversives.

19:07.800 --> 19:09.609
They respect the law.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.566
So do we.

19:13.920 --> 19:16.161
Especially the Bill of Rights.

19:17.680 --> 19:19.569
Ever read the Bill of Rights?

19:29.800 --> 19:31.040
Let's go.

19:41.640 --> 19:43.680
<i>Listen up, all of you in there.</i>

19:43.720 --> 19:45.961
<i>You have 10 minutes
to vacate the premises.</i>

19:46.560 --> 19:51.122
<i>You are now trespassing and will be
prosecuted to the full extent of the law.</i>

19:51.200 --> 19:52.440
We are not moving!

19:53.960 --> 19:55.007
<i>Is that you, Larry?</i>

19:55.920 --> 19:57.888
Yeah. Yeah, it's me.

19:58.160 --> 20:01.209
<i>Larry, you get your people out of there now
and get back to work.</i>

20:01.480 --> 20:05.201
<i>I'll forget everything.
No blacklisting, no nothing.</i>

20:07.400 --> 20:09.880
Sorry, that's not good enough.

20:10.680 --> 20:12.728
You cut our wages too goddamn much.

20:12.800 --> 20:15.167
We starve on what you pay us anyhow.

20:16.200 --> 20:17.247
Go.

20:30.800 --> 20:31.881
Nobody leave!

20:33.760 --> 20:35.603
Stay together, stay strong!

20:36.560 --> 20:38.449
The growers cut their pay in half.

20:38.560 --> 20:40.847
Now they have barricaded themselves
in the camps.

20:40.920 --> 20:41.921
This thing is blowing up.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.570
- The Filipinos?
- Yeah.

20:43.640 --> 20:46.530
And now the growers are recruiting
our people to break the strikes.

20:47.200 --> 20:49.965
That's why Larry specifically asked
for you, Cesar.

20:50.280 --> 20:51.601
He knows he can't win without us.

20:52.240 --> 20:53.480
Oh, and by the way,

20:53.560 --> 20:56.131
who gives a shit about the Filipinos?

20:56.840 --> 21:00.526
No mames.
They undercut us left and right.

21:01.480 --> 21:03.369
Do you think they would strike for us?

21:03.440 --> 21:06.410
They play the races against each other,
that is their tactic.

21:08.040 --> 21:09.690
Are we a union or not?

21:26.960 --> 21:29.884
Our brother Cesar Chavez
will speak to us now.

21:35.360 --> 21:36.600
Brothers and sisters.

21:37.720 --> 21:42.203
Today our fellow Filipino workers
have taken a vital step

21:42.520 --> 21:45.888
towards the fight for freedom and dignity

21:46.440 --> 21:48.522
that poverty has denied us.

21:49.360 --> 21:55.686
And they have come to us
and asked a very important question.

21:56.160 --> 22:02.088
Whether we're prepared to set our
differences apart and join their strike.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.961
But the most important thing to consider

22:10.080 --> 22:14.563
is if news of this strike remains only in
Delano, then we will have been defeated.

22:15.320 --> 22:21.362
Because they not only own the land,
but also the police and judges.

22:22.280 --> 22:28.481
If we show the world
their abuse, greed, and brutality

22:28.880 --> 22:32.965
then our voice will be heard
and responded to.

22:34.200 --> 22:38.000
And when they see that our actions are just

22:38.080 --> 22:41.926
they will understand
that our cause is just.

22:42.400 --> 22:46.405
Then we will prevail.
Yes we can!

22:52.080 --> 22:54.481
Strike! I

23:21.240 --> 23:22.366
The growers are going to be...

23:22.440 --> 23:24.488
Larry, now that we are together,
the growers are gonna have to...

23:24.560 --> 23:26.528
I'm not worried about them.

23:26.600 --> 23:28.409
My people are angry.

23:29.360 --> 23:31.408
This thing has been building for too long,
it's ready to explode.

23:31.560 --> 23:33.722
Everyone is angry, we just have
to manage our own people.

23:33.800 --> 23:36.610
I have people from Stockton to Coachella!

23:36.680 --> 23:37.727
I didn't say it was going to be easy,

23:37.800 --> 23:40.371
but if you take care of your side,
I take care of mine, we'll be fine.

23:40.520 --> 23:43.729
- There are things we can't control.
- No, there are things we have to control.

23:52.360 --> 23:55.569
So who the hell is this Cesar Chavez?

23:58.400 --> 23:59.845
Nobody knows.

24:01.480 --> 24:03.323
Somebody said he was from Arizona.

24:03.400 --> 24:07.291
Word is he used to hang around Alinsky
and the other commies from the CSO.

24:07.360 --> 24:10.569
He's been up and down the valley,
stirring up trouble.

24:10.640 --> 24:12.210
I heard he's Mexican.

24:15.840 --> 24:18.684
Seems a safe bet.

24:19.160 --> 24:22.687
They've come out with this newspaper.

24:26.920 --> 24:29.571
Got this beaner character in there
named Don Sotaco.

24:32.440 --> 24:33.441
There he is.

24:35.520 --> 24:37.124
He's kinda funny.

24:38.680 --> 24:41.365
Well, it's a cartoon,
but I'm not sure it's funny.

24:42.560 --> 24:44.847
Who cares, most of our workers
are illiterate.

24:45.360 --> 24:49.046
Yeah, but you can understand a cartoon
without being able to read.

24:50.520 --> 24:52.204
So, this Don Sotaco,

24:53.560 --> 24:58.726
he, uh, informs the workers
about their rights.

25:01.360 --> 25:03.886
- And this is what, a weekly?
- Mmm-hmm.

25:06.080 --> 25:07.730
Thank God it isn't a daily.

25:07.800 --> 25:14.763
Although, 52 weeks a year,
that is a lot of rights, Sheriff.

25:14.840 --> 25:17.366
Long live the strike!

25:17.880 --> 25:20.326
Long live the farmworker!

25:21.240 --> 25:23.242
Long live our cause!

25:24.640 --> 25:26.927
Long live our farmworker movement!

25:27.320 --> 25:28.560
Did they confirm?

25:28.920 --> 25:30.046
- Of course.
- Anyone...

25:30.120 --> 25:33.442
Mostly local, but some are actually
coming down from San Francisco, Arizona...

25:33.600 --> 25:36.080
- Where are they?
- I don't know. They should be here by now.

25:38.080 --> 25:40.367
Get the hell off our property!

25:40.440 --> 25:41.566
Go back to Mexico!

25:41.640 --> 25:44.689
Stay calm, don't react.

25:44.760 --> 25:46.762
We don't need you. Wetbacks.

25:46.840 --> 25:48.490
- Get out of here!
- Don't react, just keep moving.

25:48.600 --> 25:50.170
We don't need you.
We want you out of our country.

25:50.240 --> 25:53.210
We want you back to Mexico.
Get the hell out of our country!

25:53.320 --> 25:55.288
What do you think you are looking at, huh?

25:55.440 --> 25:59.001
Damn spics! We don't need you! Get out!

25:59.560 --> 26:03.201
Keep marching. Keep marching, please.

26:03.360 --> 26:05.966
- Get these sons of bitches off my land.
- Yes, sir.

26:06.040 --> 26:08.088
We aren't going anywhere,
we have the right to be here.

26:08.160 --> 26:09.161
Suit yourself.

26:09.760 --> 26:14.163
Deputies, now, you're witnesses.
This horde invaded my property

26:14.280 --> 26:17.329
and we are just defending ourselves.

26:18.040 --> 26:20.281
A man has a duty to defend his property.

26:20.360 --> 26:21.930
You are damn right he does.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.968
Cesar, they will shoot.

26:24.160 --> 26:25.321
You get rid of them!

26:27.000 --> 26:28.490
Everybody move! Move back!

26:28.680 --> 26:30.728
Back to the main road,
everybody move back now!

26:32.960 --> 26:34.689
Move back! Move back! No, no, no!

26:38.040 --> 26:39.246
Are you going to do something?

26:42.520 --> 26:45.808
You hard of hearing?
The boss told you to clear out.

26:48.880 --> 26:50.530
He's not my boss.

26:50.640 --> 26:52.563
And our tax dollars pay
for this public road.

26:52.640 --> 26:53.846
Tax dollars?

26:54.320 --> 26:55.810
There's your tax dollars.

26:58.360 --> 27:00.169
Hey, Gilbert!

27:12.520 --> 27:18.163
Hey, that's enough now. Come on, that's
all. Let's go. Get on over here.

27:18.280 --> 27:21.250
Hello, you are late.

27:24.120 --> 27:25.921
<i>Farm workers
in Delano, California</i>

27:25.960 --> 27:27.769
<i>have begun an unprecedented strike</i>

27:27.840 --> 27:28.887
<i>in the central valley.</i>

27:29.360 --> 27:31.522
<i>Filipino and Mexican workers
have joined forces</i>

27:31.680 --> 27:35.241
<i>to demand fair wages and better working
conditions for their members.</i>

27:35.400 --> 27:38.802
<i>Would you say that most of
your workers are making a decent living?</i>

27:38.920 --> 27:42.402
<i>All I can say is that the men
have to be their judges of their own,</i>

27:42.520 --> 27:45.444
<i>what they want,
because they have chosen this way of life</i>

27:45.520 --> 27:47.648
<i>and, if they were not happy,
they wouldn't be here.</i>

27:47.760 --> 27:50.570
<i>How much have you been getting
for a day's work?</i>

27:50.720 --> 27:52.245
<i>Only two dollars.</i>

27:52.720 --> 27:54.245
<i>- Two dollars a day?
- Yes.</i>

27:56.800 --> 28:00.407
- Are you sure it's not broken?
- I'm sure.

28:07.240 --> 28:08.605
Dad?

28:08.720 --> 28:12.122
It's okay, Fernando.
Go back to sleep, please.

28:16.640 --> 28:19.803
I said go back to sleep, Fernando,
you have school tomorrow.

28:28.920 --> 28:32.402
Here. Put it on.

28:45.760 --> 28:47.683
Does this help?

28:52.600 --> 28:55.843
I told you five minutes ago
to sit down at the table.

28:58.320 --> 28:59.481
Mmm.

29:00.640 --> 29:04.531
To all the growers, their lawyers
and this garbage injunction.

29:06.960 --> 29:09.645
At least they finally got Fred
to come down here.

29:09.840 --> 29:12.650
This court ruling bans all mass picketing.

29:13.160 --> 29:14.810
Mmm. And the best part,

29:14.880 --> 29:18.362
they got a ban on saying
the word "Huelga" anywhere near the fields.

29:18.480 --> 29:19.561
- "Huelga f?"
<i>- "Huelga-"</i>

29:19.720 --> 29:21.484
Can you say "Strike"?

29:21.640 --> 29:23.290
As long as you don't translate it.

29:23.360 --> 29:25.931
You would think a bunch of lawyers
would have heard of the First Amendment.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.048
It's a joke.
They'll get it thrown out on appeal.

29:28.160 --> 29:30.288
Yeah, by the time the state court
hears the appeals,

29:30.360 --> 29:32.522
the grapes will be picked,
the growers know that.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.802
There's only one thing we can do.

29:34.880 --> 29:37.451
We have to get people
to violate the injunction,

29:37.520 --> 29:38.800
and make the Sheriff enforce it.

29:39.240 --> 29:40.526
You mean get arrested.

29:40.640 --> 29:42.563
Make them arrest us and fill up the jails?

29:42.640 --> 29:45.769
And give the white press
exactly what they want? Hmm?

29:45.840 --> 29:47.365
Rowdy Mexicans in jail.

29:47.480 --> 29:49.926
Have you had your head in the dirt
this whole time?

29:50.000 --> 29:51.365
Things are changing.

29:51.480 --> 29:53.209
Okay, but who is gonna go?

29:54.040 --> 29:55.201
I'll do it.

29:55.320 --> 29:56.641
Once they get you in their jails,

29:56.680 --> 29:59.843
they can figure out ways of keeping
you there a long time, Cesar.

30:02.360 --> 30:03.407
So I'll do it.

30:04.040 --> 30:05.246
Do what?

30:07.240 --> 30:08.890
I'll get arrested.

30:10.280 --> 30:11.850
You can't get arrested.

30:12.680 --> 30:13.886
What? Why not?

30:14.080 --> 30:16.048
Well, who is going to
take care of the kids?

30:16.120 --> 30:17.690
The kids are fine.

30:17.840 --> 30:20.286
- They are big, they take care of themselves.
- No.

30:23.200 --> 30:24.884
Cesar, you are the one who says
we can't ask our members

30:24.960 --> 30:26.530
to do things we are not willing
to do ourselves.

30:26.600 --> 30:28.284
I said no.

30:33.400 --> 30:36.131
Dolores, what do you think?

30:37.360 --> 30:38.930
I think it's a good idea.

30:41.040 --> 30:43.247
I think it's a good idea, too.

30:43.920 --> 30:45.285
Come, let's eat.

30:45.960 --> 30:48.964
You know how it works,
they don't understand.

30:49.200 --> 30:50.486
Strike!

30:51.040 --> 30:52.565
Strike!

30:53.720 --> 30:55.404
Mrs. Chavez,

30:56.640 --> 31:00.247
we have a court order that forbids you
from saying the word "Huelga. <i>"</i>

31:00.560 --> 31:01.971
Strike!

31:03.720 --> 31:06.246
This is your first warning, Mrs. Chavez.

31:07.640 --> 31:09.449
This is your second!

31:38.800 --> 31:40.480
- Good morning to you.
- Good morning, sir.

31:40.520 --> 31:42.010
- Good morning, Grace.
- Good morning.

31:42.120 --> 31:44.282
Call my wife and tell her
I'm not going to be able to make lunch.

31:44.440 --> 31:46.124
Come on, let's go.

31:46.520 --> 31:50.286
I need you to take the trucks across
the border into Mexico,

31:50.360 --> 31:52.201
and I want y'all to bring me back
some illegals

31:52.280 --> 31:54.442
who are willing to work
for an honest day's pay.

31:54.520 --> 31:57.490
And I want you to bring them back here
by the truckload, you hear me.

31:57.880 --> 32:00.645
'Cause we are gonna break
this goddamn strike.

32:01.560 --> 32:03.164
You'll see what these sons of bitches do

32:03.280 --> 32:05.640
when they see their cousins
out there working on 'em fields.

32:16.760 --> 32:19.764
Everyone gather up.

32:28.040 --> 32:30.361
Who's thirsty?

32:32.120 --> 32:34.487
Here, have some cold water.

32:35.120 --> 32:36.360
It's free...

32:38.160 --> 32:42.404
I've been told that some union members

32:42.840 --> 32:46.731
affiliated with the communist party

32:48.600 --> 32:51.843
have been talking with you.

32:52.960 --> 32:57.363
Making promises.
These promises are nothing but lies.

32:57.440 --> 33:00.728
You could even end up in jail.

33:03.680 --> 33:05.409
And for what?

33:07.000 --> 33:09.128
What's wrong, Cruz?

33:09.920 --> 33:11.570
Aren't you thirsty?

33:13.480 --> 33:17.929
If any of you has a problem,
tell me about it.

33:19.000 --> 33:22.209
We don't want any problems here.

33:26.400 --> 33:29.404
- Jail was amazing?
- Yeah, it was.

33:29.480 --> 33:32.290
I got to meet so many amazing people.

33:32.360 --> 33:33.805
There was this woman, Irene,

33:33.880 --> 33:37.601
she was so smart, and I'm gonna
put her on the Credit Union.

33:38.280 --> 33:40.806
And also there was this man
who was laying next to me.

33:40.880 --> 33:42.291
Laying next to you?

33:42.400 --> 33:45.131
Yeah, I saw when he got arrested.

33:45.240 --> 33:47.971
The cops were beating him,
and they were calling him names,

33:48.080 --> 33:51.004
and they were trying to get him
to fight back and he wouldn't.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.123
Do you plan on seeing him again?

33:55.760 --> 33:57.125
Cesar, I don't know what
you are talking about.

33:57.240 --> 33:59.641
Well, you know what? Maybe we can
make him part of the team, you know?

33:59.760 --> 34:01.410
We are always looking for good men.
I mean amazing.

34:01.480 --> 34:03.005
'Cause it was amazing, right?

34:03.080 --> 34:05.560
- Cesar, don't be jealous.
- No.

34:05.640 --> 34:07.130
I'm not jealous.

34:07.240 --> 34:10.289
I'm just glad that you had
such a good time in jail.

34:14.280 --> 34:15.929
Cesar!

34:16.159 --> 34:21.610
Cesar! Hey, Cesar!
It's Jerry Cohen, remember me?

34:23.320 --> 34:25.482
- Who's that?
- He's a lawyer.

34:25.600 --> 34:26.806
You know that man?

34:26.960 --> 34:28.768
How much do you know about
what we are doing?

34:28.840 --> 34:31.366
I've been analyzing your strategy,
and one thing is clear,

34:31.440 --> 34:32.726
you have to stop these injunctions.

34:32.840 --> 34:36.003
I mean they are a catch-22,
the bail alone is going to bankrupt you.

34:36.080 --> 34:38.003
With all due respect,
I know you went to a fancy school,

34:38.080 --> 34:39.161
that doesn't make you an expert.

34:39.239 --> 34:41.719
Well, I also worked the California Rural
Legal Assistance.

34:41.800 --> 34:43.165
- For how long?
- Two years.

34:43.280 --> 34:45.806
Two years, huh? Why did you leave?

34:47.159 --> 34:48.241
Um...

34:48.320 --> 34:50.083
It's complicated.

34:50.159 --> 34:51.286
That's what I heard.

34:53.159 --> 34:54.400
You are hired.

34:55.639 --> 34:57.244
Hired?

34:57.320 --> 34:59.209
I want you full time, starting now.

34:59.320 --> 35:01.163
I thought maybe I'd do some consulting?

35:01.240 --> 35:04.767
No, as of now you are in charge
of the United Farm Workers' legal team.

35:04.840 --> 35:07.320
- Who else is on the team?
- Just you.

35:07.800 --> 35:10.326
Doesn't it take more than one person
to make a team?

35:10.480 --> 35:12.642
Oh, you'll be doing more work
than one person.

35:13.840 --> 35:15.524
Against one of the biggest
law firms in California.

35:15.640 --> 35:18.007
And you'll be getting paid
five dollars a week.

35:18.080 --> 35:19.570
Five dollars a week?

35:20.680 --> 35:23.604
You'll be happy to know that
makes you the highest paid employee.

35:24.760 --> 35:27.001
Also our lowest paid employee.

35:27.920 --> 35:29.684
Everybody makes five dollars a week?

35:30.080 --> 35:32.845
Hey! If you wanna make money,
go work for the growers.

35:43.360 --> 35:45.522
We're here to help.

35:46.200 --> 35:47.645
Don't be afraid.

35:48.800 --> 35:50.529
United we will stand.

35:50.600 --> 35:52.364
They will not defeat us.

35:52.600 --> 35:54.409
United we will stand.

35:54.520 --> 35:55.965
They will not defeat us.

35:56.120 --> 35:58.282
This movement is for you, the people.

36:00.280 --> 36:03.727
They will not defeat us.

36:05.720 --> 36:07.370
Long live the strike!

36:08.560 --> 36:10.369
Long live Cesar Chavez!

36:11.560 --> 36:13.722
Son! Son!

36:13.800 --> 36:17.407
They're not paying you enough!
Come join us!

36:18.120 --> 36:20.600
Join the cause!

36:21.080 --> 36:24.050
Son, they're not paying you enough.

36:24.800 --> 36:26.609
Don't betray your people.

36:27.080 --> 36:29.401
Hey, come join us!

36:30.000 --> 36:31.001
Come!

36:31.720 --> 36:33.165
Don't be afraid!

36:41.400 --> 36:42.447
Come on, come on, come on!

36:42.560 --> 36:44.403
Come!

36:46.840 --> 36:47.921
Get closer!

36:49.480 --> 36:51.847
- Closer together!
- Run, get together!

36:52.080 --> 36:54.242
Move back! Move back!

37:00.600 --> 37:02.523
We are not leaving!

37:03.360 --> 37:05.601
Don't move! Stay together.

37:20.360 --> 37:23.523
Pesticide! Helen!

37:24.080 --> 37:25.081
Helen!

37:27.720 --> 37:30.291
- it burns.
- I know.

37:31.760 --> 37:32.886
I almost got it.

37:35.800 --> 37:37.962
That was really scary, Cesar.

37:41.360 --> 37:43.647
What if something happened to us?

37:45.960 --> 37:48.201
What would happen to the kids?

37:55.360 --> 37:58.250
<i>People are starting to lose hope,
and I don't blame them.</i>

37:58.920 --> 38:01.844
They know the growers have broken
the strike with the illegal workers.

38:02.480 --> 38:05.370
And the sweetheart deal with the teamsters.

38:05.560 --> 38:10.043
We can't ask them to keep going when
they see people working in the fields.

38:11.040 --> 38:13.088
We have to take the next step.

38:13.360 --> 38:14.691
We are too weak.

38:15.680 --> 38:18.160
We have no laws to protect us here.

38:20.400 --> 38:23.210
With the boycott,
there are no laws to stop us.

38:24.040 --> 38:25.883
This is the moment, Cesar.

38:28.440 --> 38:30.761
This is what we came here to do.

38:34.160 --> 38:36.640
We just can't
boycott all the growers.

38:36.800 --> 38:41.408
We need to start small, we need a face,
a brand, that's what we need to focus on.

38:41.560 --> 38:43.244
And that face is Victorre Wines.

38:52.840 --> 38:55.764
<i>CESAR". Dolores Huerta will be recruiting
in the west counties,</i>

38:55.880 --> 38:58.320
<i>and Gilbert Padilla
will be recruiting in the southern cities.</i>

38:58.360 --> 39:00.601
<i>And the rest of the state we will
divide amongst each other.</i>

39:00.720 --> 39:03.564
Anybody that can travel, talk to Richard.

39:04.240 --> 39:06.208
My brother knows how to travel.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.570
To be successful,

39:08.680 --> 39:12.241
we have to have an army of boycotters,
willing to do the hard work.

39:12.880 --> 39:14.723
The bigger the army, the
bigger the success.

39:15.120 --> 39:17.043
You start small, you get wins.

39:18.120 --> 39:19.406
The army will get bigger.

39:20.720 --> 39:23.610
The people to best recruit
are the students.

39:25.040 --> 39:29.762
Civil rights groups, some church groups,
those are the best recruits.

39:29.880 --> 39:32.690
Well, any kind of recruit
is the best kind of recruit for us.

39:33.960 --> 39:37.442
So, we need to hit the streets
with aggressive leafleting.

39:37.960 --> 39:39.724
And make so much noise

39:39.800 --> 39:41.882
that they won't be able to ignore us.

39:42.040 --> 39:48.400
Picket lines, in churches,
entertainment venues, colleges, factories.

39:48.480 --> 39:50.482
Anywhere there's a large number of people.

39:50.600 --> 39:51.886
That's where you need to go.

39:52.040 --> 39:53.724
<i>Once we got their attention,</i>

39:55.120 --> 39:58.886
<i>we need to get on every radio show,
and every television show.</i>

39:59.000 --> 40:00.968
There's no bathrooms in the fields.
There's no minimum wage.

40:01.080 --> 40:03.440
The best thing that you can do,
the way we can put pressure,

40:04.120 --> 40:05.610
is to boycott.

40:06.320 --> 40:08.482
You can help by boycotting Victorre Grapes.

40:08.600 --> 40:09.647
Okay, thank you.

40:09.840 --> 40:12.081
<i>CESAR". And tell them personal stories.</i>

40:12.280 --> 40:15.841
<i>Firsthand, from the people
that have suffered in the fields.</i>

40:16.160 --> 40:18.970
<i>Because we are fighting
for basic human rights.</i>

40:20.800 --> 40:23.929
<i>The attention of national
legislators was focused on Delano</i>

40:24.000 --> 40:27.129
<i>when the Senate Subcommittee
on migrant labor conducted hearings</i>

40:27.320 --> 40:28.360
<i>in the Delano high school.</i>

40:28.920 --> 40:31.127
<i>Headed by New Jersey's Harrison Williams.</i>

40:31.360 --> 40:36.207
<i>It also included California's George
Murphy, and New York's Robert Kennedy.</i>

40:38.280 --> 40:40.044
Senator Kennedy
can be very supportive

40:40.120 --> 40:41.921
if he thinks the cause
can make a difference.

40:42.000 --> 40:45.447
So, when he comes, make sure you
walk with him so they can take pictures.

40:45.800 --> 40:46.847
How are you, sir?

40:47.600 --> 40:48.601
How are you? Thank you.

40:48.680 --> 40:49.681
Hi, how are you?

40:49.840 --> 40:52.446
Senator Kennedy, great to see you again.
I'd like to introduce Cesar Chavez.

40:52.520 --> 40:53.965
- It's a pleasure...
- It's likewise.

40:54.040 --> 40:55.530
Go, go, go.

40:55.680 --> 40:56.841
You were supposed to walk with him.

40:56.960 --> 40:59.281
Hi, John, how are you? Good to see you.

40:59.640 --> 41:01.449
Don't believe everything you hear today.

41:03.720 --> 41:06.530
Yeah, it looks like he is not even
talking to them either so...

41:10.640 --> 41:14.361
Do you write down the license
plate numbers of everyone in the city?

41:14.800 --> 41:17.724
I'm glad he came,
but I think it's just for show.

41:18.320 --> 41:19.731
I think you're wrong, Fred.

41:21.240 --> 41:22.401
I hope so.

41:22.680 --> 41:25.923
I also see complaints here
from Mr. Chavez that, uh,

41:26.680 --> 41:29.365
pesticides have been sprayed
on some of his picketers.

41:29.480 --> 41:31.209
I'm aware of no such incidents.

41:32.400 --> 41:35.051
What about shots being fired
in their general direction?

41:35.200 --> 41:38.488
We've looked into every one
of Mr. Chavez's complaints

41:38.600 --> 41:41.331
and haven't found an ounce
of truth to any of it.

41:43.360 --> 41:44.361
Lie.

41:45.160 --> 41:50.564
Is it true that you detained some
picketers as a preventive measure?

41:51.560 --> 41:53.369
Your arrest record seems to confirm it.

41:53.440 --> 41:56.284
If I have reason to believe that
there's going to be a riot started,

41:56.440 --> 42:00.240
and someone tells me there's going
to be trouble unless I stop them,

42:00.400 --> 42:02.243
it's my duty to stop them.

42:04.120 --> 42:05.640
You just go out there and arrest them?

42:05.680 --> 42:06.920
Absolutely.

42:07.040 --> 42:08.520
Who told you they were going to riot?

42:10.720 --> 42:11.926
The foremen.

42:13.120 --> 42:14.770
Right out there in the fields.

42:15.400 --> 42:17.607
The ones we were talking to,
said that if we didn't stop them,

42:17.760 --> 42:19.489
they were going to cut their hearts out.

42:19.560 --> 42:22.962
So, rather than let things get out of hand,
we just removed the cause.

42:23.080 --> 42:26.084
This is the most interesting
concept, I think,

42:26.880 --> 42:31.124
that you suddenly hear talk of
somebody who's gonna get out of order,

42:31.440 --> 42:32.965
perhaps violate the law,

42:33.400 --> 42:37.200
and so you go in and arrest
the intended victim of the crime,

42:37.280 --> 42:39.328
and they haven't done anything wrong.

42:40.480 --> 42:44.451
I want to thank Sheriff Smith
for his services to the citizens of Delano.

42:49.280 --> 42:51.931
We'll now take an hour recess for lunch.

42:52.000 --> 42:55.288
Excuse me, can I suggest...

42:55.400 --> 42:58.529
I would just like to suggest that,
in the interim period of time,

42:58.600 --> 43:00.409
in the luncheon period of time,

43:00.480 --> 43:03.404
that the Sheriff
and the Kern County District Attorney,

43:03.480 --> 43:06.689
read the Constitution
of the United States of America.

43:10.760 --> 43:12.489
I guess I was wrong.

43:27.480 --> 43:29.289
Hey! Fuck you!

43:29.760 --> 43:31.808
We are going to
get you, little beaner.

43:32.160 --> 43:33.446
Wetback!

43:34.960 --> 43:36.962
We are going to kick your ass.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.321
You should talk to
Fernando before you go.

43:47.760 --> 43:49.046
Hmm.

43:51.560 --> 43:53.562
He's having trouble with those kids again.

43:54.360 --> 43:55.486
Where is he?

43:55.560 --> 43:56.846
He's at Richard's.

43:58.160 --> 44:00.367
He's been spending a lot
of time there lately.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.684
Maybe that's not such a good idea.

44:03.800 --> 44:05.689
Maybe you should talk to him.

44:07.680 --> 44:09.682
I'll talk to him when I get back.

44:10.400 --> 44:13.210
Cesar, you know that boy
is as stubborn as you are.

44:16.400 --> 44:18.767
Your clean socks are on the top shelf.

44:21.720 --> 44:23.245
Take all of them.

44:24.240 --> 44:25.401
It's a lot of socks.

44:26.040 --> 44:27.565
It's a long walk.

44:51.720 --> 44:52.846
Cesar.

44:53.360 --> 44:55.203
You got a permit for this march?

44:55.280 --> 44:59.410
It's not a march, Sheriff. It's a
pilgrimage all the way to Sacramento.

44:59.520 --> 45:01.921
And our families are here
just to say goodbye.

45:03.120 --> 45:05.691
Do you hear that?

45:05.760 --> 45:12.484
They don't like working for a day's wage,
but they'll walk over 300 miles for free.

45:15.440 --> 45:18.444
Even pilgrims ain't allowed in the street
without a permit.

45:18.920 --> 45:22.322
Fine, we'll use the sidewalk.
It's open to the public.

46:02.080 --> 46:04.890
If we leave at 10 p.m.,
we can catch them in Modesto.

46:04.960 --> 46:06.200
Yeah, I know Dad.

46:08.640 --> 46:10.244
Fernando, what are you doing?

46:10.320 --> 46:11.441
I'm not going with you guys.

46:11.480 --> 46:14.086
We're going to see your dad
and from there we can go home.

46:14.160 --> 46:15.571
I don't want to see my Dad.

46:15.640 --> 46:17.244
He'll be happy to see you!

46:17.320 --> 46:18.480
He won't even know I'm there.

46:18.520 --> 46:20.522
He only cares about the Union.

46:23.200 --> 46:24.929
Check this out.

46:25.000 --> 46:28.686
Big article about the auto workers
standing down to show solidarity.

46:29.080 --> 46:30.081
Hmm.

46:30.160 --> 46:31.286
Front page?

46:31.360 --> 46:33.727
Page six, but we are moving up.

46:35.200 --> 46:37.362
And those longshore workers
are standing down too.

46:37.520 --> 46:38.646
Rookie!

46:39.200 --> 46:40.531
Mansi!

46:41.160 --> 46:43.162
I saw everybody on the news.

46:44.680 --> 46:48.685
I got tired of just sitting around,
watching a lot of TV, you know.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.002
I got some donations from
a department store.

46:57.480 --> 46:59.050
I am glad you came.

46:59.640 --> 47:00.766
I am glad you came.

47:02.520 --> 47:03.521
Donations.

47:03.880 --> 47:04.881
Boots.

47:06.200 --> 47:07.725
They're brand new.

47:09.320 --> 47:11.368
Yeah, about 150 miles too late.

47:28.880 --> 47:30.723
Boycott Victorre!

47:30.840 --> 47:34.242
<i>I am Chief Executive Officer
of the United Church of Christ.</i>

47:34.360 --> 47:37.682
<i>My name is Rabbi Tannenbaum.
I came here from New York City.</i>

47:37.760 --> 47:41.526
<i>We believe the United Farm Workers
and their leader, Cesar Chavez, represent</i>

47:41.600 --> 47:45.400
<i>the hope and aspirations
of a vast majority of farm workers.</i>

47:45.560 --> 47:49.770
<i>I think every American has a stake to bring
about social change within the system,</i>

47:49.920 --> 47:52.651
<i>because if nonviolent means fail,</i>

47:52.760 --> 47:55.764
<i>this becomes a setback for
the entire democratic process.</i>

47:57.400 --> 48:01.962
In colors, in colors,

48:02.080 --> 48:06.051
are the little birds
that come from outside.

48:06.760 --> 48:10.731
In colors, in colors,

48:10.800 --> 48:15.010
is the rainbow that we see shining.

48:15.200 --> 48:18.044
And that is why I love

48:18.160 --> 48:19.605
The great loves of many colors

48:31.440 --> 48:34.842
<i>My union, the U.A.W.
and the Industrial Union Department</i>

48:34.960 --> 48:40.842
<i>will pledge $5,000 a month to these workers
for as long as it takes to win their strike.</i>

48:41.400 --> 48:44.006
The average farm worker only lives to 49.

48:44.520 --> 48:46.682
They say they won't
give you bathrooms in the fields

48:46.800 --> 48:49.087
because Mexicans don't know
how to use them.

48:50.160 --> 48:53.323
<i>I'm Jackie Stringer.
We just drove down from Portland.</i>

48:53.440 --> 48:54.561
<i>CESAR". That's a long drive.</i>

48:55.000 --> 48:56.729
I've been watching the news.

48:56.800 --> 48:59.485
I saw pictures of the children
working in the fields...

48:59.640 --> 49:01.165
We'd like to help in some way.

49:01.280 --> 49:04.568
Well you can do this, don't buy
any more Victorre products.

49:04.640 --> 49:06.529
No more Victorre wine at dinner.

49:06.640 --> 49:09.530
- And then have your friends do the same.
- I will.

49:22.160 --> 49:23.685
Excuse me, sir, can I help you?

49:30.160 --> 49:33.721
You have to sit on your damn booze,
you hear me?

49:33.840 --> 49:36.286
I don't care if you have
to sit on it for a year.

49:36.360 --> 49:40.490
We need you to stay strong.
We need you to hold the line.

49:40.560 --> 49:42.642
We're all counting on you. All of us.

49:43.400 --> 49:44.811
Excuse us.

49:47.200 --> 49:52.047
Strong? Stay strong?
This boycott is killing us!

49:52.480 --> 49:54.130
Have you seen the headlines
they're getting?

49:54.200 --> 49:56.202
Not just in San Francisco,

49:56.320 --> 50:00.291
but in L.A. and San Diego
and Fresno and Sacramento.

50:00.360 --> 50:02.283
They're pulling our products
all over the damn state!

50:02.360 --> 50:06.490
That's costing us money, real money,
Mr. Bogdanovich.

50:06.560 --> 50:09.564
You wanna come in here and explain that
to our shareholders?

50:09.680 --> 50:13.287
You wanna reimburse us those losses
so our stock price doesn't dip?

50:17.000 --> 50:18.411
Can we sit?

50:18.600 --> 50:23.561
<i>A 340 mile pilgrimage
started in Delano by 67 strikers,</i>

50:23.680 --> 50:27.526
<i>concluded today on the steps
of the State Capitol in Sacramento,</i>

50:27.720 --> 50:32.806
<i>where more than 10,000 supporters
welcomed Cesar Chavez and his procession.</i>

50:33.080 --> 50:36.402
<i>The march has strengthened the boycott
and efforts by the strikers</i>

50:36.560 --> 50:40.042
<i>to put pressure on the
label Victorre Wines.</i>

50:40.760 --> 50:43.411
Huelga! Huelga!

50:50.880 --> 50:52.041
Cesar!

50:53.440 --> 50:54.601
Cesar!

50:55.960 --> 50:58.930
There's a guy on the phone,
he says he's from Victorre.

50:59.880 --> 51:01.609
And he wants to negotiate.

51:03.320 --> 51:04.765
He's called three times.

51:09.120 --> 51:10.281
Get Jerry up here!

51:10.600 --> 51:11.761
Okay!

51:12.400 --> 51:15.324
Fine, you've got your deal,
but if we're gonna pay top dollar,

51:15.440 --> 51:17.169
we expect top dollar work.

51:17.320 --> 51:21.882
That means no one, and I mean no one, is
gonna cut unripe grapes to pad their lugs.

51:21.960 --> 51:23.291
Or stick them full of god damn dirt clods.

51:23.400 --> 51:24.447
Objection.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.128
Objection? What do you mean?

51:27.280 --> 51:28.805
Well, it's a personal objection.

51:29.280 --> 51:32.489
You may not be aware but these people
have been doing this for a very long time.

51:32.600 --> 51:34.682
They don't need you to tell them
how to pick a grape.

51:34.840 --> 51:37.411
Well, you tell them that
when they're packing my grapes...

51:50.040 --> 51:52.964
Well that was the most eloquent piss
I've ever heard.

51:54.760 --> 51:57.809
<i>in California,
actor Ronald Reagan and Mrs. Reagan arrive</i>

51:57.880 --> 52:00.326
<i>to cast their votes in the state's
primary election.</i>

52:00.520 --> 52:03.126
<i>He's the Republican nominee for governor.</i>

52:10.200 --> 52:11.281
Helen!

52:11.360 --> 52:12.566
Leave him alone!

52:13.040 --> 52:15.241
- Hey, you wetback.
- Beaner, beaner, boy.

52:15.360 --> 52:16.691
Get out of here!

52:16.800 --> 52:18.165
Get the hell out of here!

52:18.840 --> 52:19.921
What are you doing?

52:20.000 --> 52:21.570
I'm standing up for my son.

52:22.520 --> 52:24.249
Because somebody has to.

52:45.920 --> 52:47.251
So what's your plan?

52:49.880 --> 52:52.531
You can't stay at your
grandparents' house forever.

52:53.840 --> 52:56.525
Don't act like all of a sudden
you are interested in what I'm doing.

52:56.880 --> 52:58.530
Of course I'm interested.

53:00.560 --> 53:02.085
You're my son.

53:06.680 --> 53:09.081
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

53:12.120 --> 53:14.691
Can you rethink this?

53:46.920 --> 53:49.924
<i>Fernando is going to be fine
with your parents.</i>

53:52.400 --> 53:54.641
And I'm sure he'll be back soon.

53:57.400 --> 53:59.289
It's going to be fine.

54:04.600 --> 54:07.126
Aren't you going to eat something?

54:17.840 --> 54:20.286
You want some carrots or broccoli
that your grandpa grows?

54:21.120 --> 54:22.770
You still hungry? Carrot?

54:25.320 --> 54:26.924
I just got word.

54:27.800 --> 54:29.848
Chavez is going to target us next.

54:32.160 --> 54:33.685
Zucchini.

54:34.160 --> 54:37.050
Dad? What should we do?

54:40.520 --> 54:41.851
I don't know, John.

54:41.960 --> 54:45.248
I'm not the one who went to college.
I'm not the one with the Master's Degree.

54:45.320 --> 54:47.243
I'm only the one
who invested a lot of money

54:47.320 --> 54:49.766
in his only son,

54:49.840 --> 54:54.368
hoping that one day, he would be able
to answer one simple question.

54:56.160 --> 55:01.007
How do I not drive my father's business
into the fucking ground?

55:02.360 --> 55:07.526
I'll, um, talk to the Sheriff.

55:13.200 --> 55:14.486
You're a big man.

55:15.480 --> 55:17.323
Broccoli.

55:18.240 --> 55:19.366
Hmm?

55:22.960 --> 55:24.883
It's time for his nap, Sir.

55:26.400 --> 55:28.482
No, no. You can leave him. He is fine.

55:32.520 --> 55:34.329
Yes, sir.

55:34.760 --> 55:40.722
Maria, you know about this Chavez, no?
Do you really think he's one of you?

55:44.240 --> 55:45.765
Yes, sir.

55:46.560 --> 55:47.846
Hmm.

55:47.920 --> 55:49.888
Well, I'm one of you too.

55:50.040 --> 55:52.361
I came from Croatia with nothing.

55:52.560 --> 55:57.202
Everything I got, I built with my own
hands, my own labor, and my own sweat.

55:57.280 --> 56:00.887
I don't see why anyone should be able
to take that away from me.

56:02.400 --> 56:04.004
So now you want me to help you?

56:04.080 --> 56:05.320
No, no. It's very simple.

56:05.400 --> 56:07.687
I want you to do your job.

56:07.800 --> 56:08.926
Patience.

56:09.640 --> 56:11.244
Is that what you told Victorre?

56:11.760 --> 56:14.764
Because this time we actually
need you to do something.

56:14.840 --> 56:19.402
You see, after the senate hearings,
I can't do nothing about nothing.

56:19.640 --> 56:20.926
Unless they break the law.

56:21.240 --> 56:23.129
Did you hear what I just said?

56:23.280 --> 56:27.604
They are targeting my family now.
Do you understand?

56:27.680 --> 56:30.729
Or do you need my father
to repeat it to you, hmm?

56:34.720 --> 56:36.290
I got too much heat on me.

56:38.600 --> 56:43.083
I can turn a blind eye,
but that's as far as I can go on this.

56:45.120 --> 56:46.770
You do that.

56:47.360 --> 56:48.964
Sit on your ass.

57:17.320 --> 57:19.561
Hey! You okay?

57:19.640 --> 57:21.085
Yes, I'm okay.

57:21.160 --> 57:22.161
Okay, don't move.

57:25.640 --> 57:27.165
Stop it! That's enough!

57:27.240 --> 57:29.561
I said stop! Leave him alone!

57:29.640 --> 57:32.007
You don't want to do this!
You don't wanna hurt this man!

57:32.080 --> 57:33.241
What are you doing, Cesar?

57:33.320 --> 57:34.845
Leave him alone.

57:34.960 --> 57:38.009
This son of a bitch needs to pay
right here, right now.

57:38.080 --> 57:39.081
No, no, no.

57:39.160 --> 57:42.687
The next person who lays a hand on him
is out of the Union!

57:43.520 --> 57:44.851
He's gone!

57:45.520 --> 57:46.760
You don't want to do this!

57:46.840 --> 57:50.128
Not like this!
This is not the way to do things.

57:51.440 --> 57:53.522
Get that piece of shit out of here.

57:53.680 --> 57:54.727
What did you say?

57:54.800 --> 57:57.087
Eli! Come on!

57:57.200 --> 57:58.929
- What?
- Stop it!

57:59.000 --> 58:02.129
I said get that piece of shit
out of here and throw him in the trash.

58:02.200 --> 58:04.680
Do you need
someone to translate that for you?

58:11.040 --> 58:15.125
Stop! You're out of the Union!
You're out of the Union! You hear me?

58:15.200 --> 58:17.726
You are out! Go! Get out!

58:45.160 --> 58:47.208
<i>CESAR". We have completely lost our way.</i>

58:48.080 --> 58:51.163
<i>How can we condemn
police brutalities in the inner cities,</i>

58:51.240 --> 58:53.720
<i>yet advocate violence
out here in the fields?</i>

58:54.560 --> 58:58.690
How can we criticize the carnage
in Vietnam, yet cry for blood here at home?

58:59.040 --> 59:01.088
This isn't about Vietnam,

59:01.920 --> 59:03.206
this is about Delano,

59:04.200 --> 59:06.168
this is about being a man,

59:06.920 --> 59:09.082
this is about enough is enough!

59:10.240 --> 59:11.844
No, no, no.

59:11.920 --> 59:15.083
Those of you running around,
destroying things,

59:15.720 --> 59:17.165
giving into your hatred

59:17.600 --> 59:19.602
and your chicken shit macho ideals

59:19.680 --> 59:22.001
are seriously sabotaging
the efforts of La Causa,

59:22.120 --> 59:23.610
and I will not stand for it!

59:31.200 --> 59:32.361
I failed you.

59:36.400 --> 59:38.402
I failed you as a leader.

59:39.920 --> 59:41.570
And I have something to tell you.

59:42.280 --> 59:44.248
Three days ago I stopped eating.

59:46.960 --> 59:50.362
I will continue to fast until everyone,

59:50.480 --> 59:53.211
and I mean everyone,
in our beautiful movement

59:54.400 --> 59:56.641
makes a pledge recommitting themselves

59:57.120 --> 59:58.451
to nonviolence.

59:59.560 --> 01:00:02.962
'Cause we move forward together,
or not at all.

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:12.929
So that's your big solution?
Starvin' yourself?

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.843
That helps them more than us!

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:15.921
Settle down.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.241
Yes or no? Yes or no?

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:19.481
- Yes!
- No!

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:23.924
Settle down. Come on. Please sit down.
The meeting is not over.

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:29.761
You okay?

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:35.328
I had a bad dream.

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:38.248
Dreamin' about food again?

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.560
Mmm-mmm.

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.243
No. The ranch...

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:46.691
The horses were screaming.

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:52.042
Like, when the bulldozer came.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.570
I couldn't move my legs

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:57.090
and everyone left me behind.

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:02.606
I haven't thought about that
bulldozer in years.

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:06.764
What I remember most

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:10.124
was that feeling,

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:12.600
that feeling of

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:14.361
impotence.

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:18.281
When that bulldozer knocked over the farm.

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:20.689
Dad couldn't look me in the eye.

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:24.045
That look on his face...

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:27.440
The shame behind his eyes...

01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:31.085
It never left him.

01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:35.961
It's the first time I saw the old man cry.

01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:42.722
That's what I'm scared of, Rookie.

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:49.244
To go back and face my family,

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:53.601
after everything that
I've put them through,

01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:56.971
and tell them that it
was all for nothing...

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:02.130
So this is how you face them?

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:06.281
Mansi, listen,

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:10.567
you know I've been with you.
Through thick and through thin.

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:14.682
But we need a leader not a martyr.

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:17.241
I need to understand what you're doing.

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:20.001
I've lost my way...

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:21.526
We all lost our way.

01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:25.927
The violence, the anger...

01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:28.525
I'm angry too!

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.684
I'm angry that I live in a world

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:32.962
where a man who picks your food
can't feed his family.

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:36.931
I used to think

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:40.011
the fight was with the growers.

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:44.689
It's with ourselves.

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:48.609
We need to stop acting like victims.

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:52.720
I'm not going to stop,

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:57.042
I'm going to see it all the way through.

01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:02.560
Because if we lose...

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:05.722
I won't be able
to look at my family in the eye.

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:10.211
What if you die, Mansi?

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:13.163
Who are we going to look to then?

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:29.768
Get up there, it's a great shot.

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:36.491
<i>If you are
just arriving, please,</i>

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:38.409
<i>head to the registration table to check in</i>

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:40.727
<i>and sign our pledge of non-violence.</i>

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.206
Dear brothers and sisters.

01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:24.851
As we prepare to celebrate
the mystery of Christ's love,

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:26.490
let us acknowledge our sins.

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:28.962
I confess to almighty God

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:33.045
and to you, my brothers and sisters,
that I have sinned through my own fault

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:35.885
in my thoughts and in my words,
in what I have done and have failed to do.

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:38.645
Through my fault, through my fault
through my most grievous fault.

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:25.045
It's okay. It's okay, Cesar.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.367
<i>There is no
strike in the vineyards.</i>

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:40.450
<i>Our workers have
sought to stay with us,</i>

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:44.047
<i>and continue work without any interest
in this outside organization.</i>

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:45.281
<i>They don't belong here</i>

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:47.727
<i>and I wish they would all go back
to where they came from.</i>

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:51.123
<i>The Chavez group are
seeking to force the growers</i>

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:54.568
<i>to recognize their group
as the bargaining agent.</i>

01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:00.250
<i>WOMAN". And they've interfered
with our daily workers.</i>

01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:05.402
<i>And the only contracts that
were signed between Mr. Chavez's union</i>

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:09.320
<i>and a few wineries that signed up
under the coercion of his threats...</i>

01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:17.241
<i>HELEN". What if something happens to us?</i>

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:19.321
<i>I'm standing up for my son!</i>

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:20.890
<i>What would happen to the kids?</i>

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:23.570
<i>Mr. Chavez!</i>

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:48.682
They've been coming in bigger numbers
ever since Chavez quit eating.

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:52.683
How long can a man go without food?

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:55.964
It depends on the man, John.

01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:59.122
Everything depends on the man.

01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:03.922
Maybe we let, uh, Chavez
starve himself to death,

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:07.282
then we won't have to do anything.

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:13.203
Unfortunately, I don't think
he is the suicidal type.

01:08:19.319 --> 01:08:21.402
Ma! I'm gonna leave
some more stuff here.

01:08:21.479 --> 01:08:23.482
Mostly clothes I don't wear anymore.

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:29.291
Mom, what's wrong?

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:47.801
Does he know what he's doing to you?

01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:49.844
No. He doesn't.

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:55.441
Please go see your father before you leave.

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:02.330
How is he?

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:06.330
He's not good.

01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:16.202
Thank you. My brother appreciates it.

01:09:16.279 --> 01:09:18.442
- Hi.
- Hi Cruz, how're you doing?

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:21.490
I brought my cousins to sign the pledge,
they just crossed the border.

01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:23.728
Well done, have them sign.

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:28.446
Look.

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:30.648
I brought Cesar some food.

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:33.884
Please tell him to eat something
and stop being stubborn.

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:01.328
- You wanna lie down?
- No.

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:02.920
Come on. I'll fix your pillow for you.

01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:05.765
No, no. I'm okay.

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:10.570
I'm going to go home now.

01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:12.890
Do you need anything?

01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:15.326
Did Fernando come?

01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:19.521
No.

01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:13.127
And he took bread in his hands

01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:14.726
blessed it

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:18.485
and gave it to his disciples and said

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:21.089
"Take this all of you, and eat it"

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:23.561
"this is my body
which will be given up for you."

01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:26.041
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:45.806
Amen.

01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:09.525
I come as an American citizen

01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:12.041
to honor him for what he has done.

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:15.442
Not just for you, not just for the state.

01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:18.564
But for all of the United
States of America.

01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:24.967
I come here out of respect

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:28.044
for one of the heroic figures of our time,

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:30.563
Cesar Chavez!

01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:44.647
<i>The consumer
has a tremendous interest</i>

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:47.326
<i>and, I think, should support the
farm worker and support the farmer.</i>

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:49.801
<i>And the farm workers are
in that field, in that ranch,</i>

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:51.530
<i>they're working, they're not on strike.</i>

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:56.686
<i>Meanwhile, Cesar Chavez has
organized his efforts to employ a new tactic,</i>

01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:58.888
<i>one that would have a national effect.</i>

01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:00.645
<i>One of the biggest facts is that</i>

01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:04.566
<i>the American public won't stand
for injustice as long as they know.</i>

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:09.724
<i>And we are fighting for legitimate wages
in a legitimate way.</i>

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:13.202
<i>One of the biggest weapons
we have is the boycott.</i>

01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:17.922
<i>Not only is it an economic weapon
but it's also a non-violent weapon.</i>

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.240
<i>Picket lines
have been put around...</i>

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:20.321
Prick.

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:22.368
<i>Supermarkets in 23 major cities.</i>

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:25.569
<i>Most supermarkets in the country
still stock grapes.</i>

01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:28.883
<i>But a significant number of shoppers,
mostly housewives,</i>

01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:30.166
<i>are not buying the grapes.</i>

01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:32.322
<i>They are observing the boycott.</i>

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:36.291
<i>That's a report from Delano, California.
This is Charles Walker...</i>

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:51.811
We know that your organization supported
us in the picket lines in Pittsburgh,

01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:52.927
and we were wondering if you could

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.844
organize another team of people again
this coming week.

01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:57.684
What city are you in?

01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:58.841
Montreal?

01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:01.321
Wisconsin is next, okay?

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:02.686
Okay, I'll tell everyone.

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:04.560
Thank you, bye.

01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:10.486
Last report estimates that we've cost them

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:13.321
$17 million to date!

01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:20.327
I wish they'd paid that in fair wages.

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:24.801
What is your view
of the strike of the grape industry?

01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:26.166
The grape boycott...

01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:29.767
Well, I've classified that
in the past in a number of public occasions

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:32.207
as immoral. I think it is.

01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:34.850
Get me John on the phone!

01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:35.921
Yes, sir.

01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:46.160
Did you see it?

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.570
Man of the year!

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:50.649
I thought they were going to make
him Pope.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.651
I know... It's all right.

01:14:57.240 --> 01:14:59.004
Well, let's get together on Sunday.

01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:06.567
I saw her last week.
She told me and I forgot.

01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:10.564
But she looks great. She looks great.

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:11.687
Yes, she does.

01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:13.364
Gentlemen.

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:15.761
Look,

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:19.849
I say it's time for the families to
put their differences aside

01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:22.688
and speak together with one voice.

01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:24.081
I agree.

01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:28.329
Let's sit down with these bastards
and settle this thing once and for all.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.365
Jack, are you serious?

01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:37.807
You want to sit down with these characters?

01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:41.010
We can't hang on much longer.

01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:43.488
This boycott is bleeding us to death.

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:48.090
If we sit down with them it won't
be a boycott, it will be an insurrection.

01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:50.731
We still gotta negotiate.

01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:54.521
We don't have to negotiate,
we have to dictate terms.

01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:56.481
Look,

01:15:57.840 --> 01:15:59.763
I hate dealing with these dirty foreigners,

01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:03.650
but we can't keep
putting on fake labels forever.

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.449
I'm a dirty foreigner, Jack.

01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:10.327
You know what I mean.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.128
I'm not the only one who feels like this.

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:17.530
You're not? Well, who else feels that way?

01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:20.011
Jack's got a point.

01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:25.162
It's time for us to cut our losses
and negotiate.

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:27.728
You don't negotiate with children.

01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:31.282
You don't give children
every piece of candy in the store.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.722
With children, you set the rules
and you make sure they obey them.

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:45.881
How you been?

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:49.245
I'm good. I broke 70.

01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:56.761
You know, when the Chinese
came to America to build the rail roads,

01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:58.721
you know what
they demanded of their overseers?

01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:00.841
No.

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:03.561
Food. Good food.

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:06.725
And enough time to enjoy it.

01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:10.200
And if the owners skimped on that,
they wouldn't lift a finger.

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:13.642
Give the Chinese a good meal every day

01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:15.881
and they could
build the infrastructure of a continent.

01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:20.164
Their meal is what gave
their lives dignity.

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:24.922
And to them, dignity was
more important than money.

01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:28.008
That's nice, huh?

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:31.451
You have this annoying habit
of turning everything into a lesson.

01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:35.130
I just like Chinese food.

01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:41.201
How you doing?

01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:44.564
I told you. I'm good.

01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:47.810
With golf?

01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:49.846
What's wrong with golf?

01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:57.368
You are becoming a real American.

01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:00.530
Golf is from Scotland.

01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:12.082
<i>We interrupt to bring
you this bulletin from Los Angeles.</i>

01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:15.528
<i>New York Senator Robert Kennedy
has been shot in the head,</i>

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:18.171
<i>minutes ago as he left the platform</i>

01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:21.289
<i>from which he made his victory statement
in Los Angeles.</i>

01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:24.603
<i>The detailed report
which we did receive initially</i>

01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:28.725
<i>pictured Kennedy
on the floor of the hotel kitchen.</i>

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:32.850
<i>Blood streaming from his face,
his eyes open but unseeing.</i>

01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:36.130
<i>He is on his way,
or perhaps has already arrived</i>

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:38.487
<i>at an unnamed hospital in Los Angeles.</i>

01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:43.923
<i>The moment further word is received
we will pass it along to you immediately.</i>

01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:49.890
<i>The final act in the
stunning tragedy of Robert Francis Kennedy</i>

01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:51.962
<i>began this morning
with a touching ceremony</i>

01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:55.289
<i>in St. Patrick's Cathedral
here in New York City.</i>

01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:58.091
<i>The late senator was then
transported to his final resting place,</i>

01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:02.526
<i>near his brother the late President
at Arlington National Cemetery.</i>

01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:08.248
<i>I, Richard Milhous Nixon,
do solemnly swear...</i>

01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:13.247
Everyone, stop working for a minute.

01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:16.723
Come, join the strike.
Cesar Chavez wants to defend you!

01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:22.484
<i>That I will faithfully execute the
office of President of the United States...</i>

01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:29.521
<i>And will to the best of my ability...</i>

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:34.327
<i>Preserve, protect and defend...</i>

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:39.324
<i>The Constitution of the United States...</i>

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:48.529
<i>So help me God.</i>

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:26.888
Slow down!

01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:29.886
Slow down! Slow down!

01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:40.363
- Call an ambulance!
- Juan! Juan!

01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:43.404
Help! Help!

01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:14.486
<i>We thank you
for all that you are doing for us.</i>

01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:16.324
<i>We very much appreciate it.</i>

01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:18.201
Yes, sir.

01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:20.248
Well, you're someone
who understands business

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:23.563
and you're a Californian,
we're all Californians here...

01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:25.411
Yes, sir.

01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:27.770
I'll do my best.

01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:30.207
And thank you, thank you so much.

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.529
Take care, bye.

01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:39.001
Nixon has promised
to sell our grapes in Europe.

01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:40.531
And whatever's leftover

01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:43.888
he'll have the Department of Defense
buy and feed to our soldiers.

01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:08.091
<i>They're getting you
out in five days,</i>

01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:09.969
but I'm not sure about the others.

01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:11.451
It's all lies.

01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:13.450
They're saying we provoked them.

01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:16.808
That the strike is not legal, they are
painting us to look like criminals.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.243
And ever since they dumped the grapes
in Europe, their sales have gone up there.

01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:24.970
By 140%.

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:37.169
We're not gonna survive Nixon.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.365
Then we have to go over there.

01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:47.646
To Europe?

01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:52.087
If they're running, we have to catch them.

01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:55.880
We can barely keep things together here,
Mansi.

01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:57.041
I know.

01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:22.160
I never thought
I'd be saying this in my life.

01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:28.089
To Richard Milhous Nixon!

01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:29.766
To Nixon!

01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:47.890
Focus on human law,
since it actually exists over in Europe.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.446
The growers have completely
subverted the system here,

01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:52.443
but Europe still defends workers' rights.

01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:54.960
- - I hear they
get one month vacations there.

01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:57.005
You might want to mention that

01:23:57.080 --> 01:23:59.924
Vietnam is basically awash
in Bogdanovich's grapes and napalm.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:01.729
I heard the food is terrible over there.

01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:04.849
I don't care how bad the food is,
you're not starting a fast, Cesar.

01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:06.001
Where is my coat?

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:16.201
<i>CESAR". Hey, Helen.</i>

01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:18.049
You should see this place.

01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:19.731
How are the kids?

01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:22.320
And Fernando?

01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:26.121
Okay.

01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:28.760
<i>I'll see you in a couple of days.</i>

01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:31.167
Fares please.

01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:32.487
Yes, sir.

01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:33.681
- Albert.
- 2p please.

01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:57.607
- Mr. Chavez?
- Yes.

01:24:58.640 --> 01:24:59.687
Lovely to meet you.

01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:01.086
- Nice to meet you.
- Welcome.

01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:10.001
We're here with Cesar Chavez,
the civil rights activist,

01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:12.845
who has caused quite a stir in America
from his ongoing boycott

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.970
<i>that has meant millions of Americans
have stopped eating table grapes.</i>

01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:17.166
Does that work for you, Mr. Chavez?

01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:18.441
Thank you.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.320
<i>We are making a plea
of common sense, to an industry</i>

01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:26.523
<i>that refuses to recognize
the basic human rights of its workers.</i>

01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:29.763
<i>Besides this boycott,
your movement has marched and striked</i>

01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:32.047
<i>and you yourself have done a 25 day fast.</i>

01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:33.321
<i>Why has it gone this far?</i>

01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:37.371
<i>Well, despite the success we had
against the growers in California,</i>

01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:40.122
<i>they still refuse
to sit down and negotiate with us.</i>

01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:43.201
And it's not
a question of economics anymore.

01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:45.970
<i>It's more a stubbornness.</i>

01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:48.407
<i>They want to show that
they're strong and not weak.</i>

01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:50.124
<i>So they would
rather export the grapes</i>

01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:51.725
<i>than sit down and negotiate with you?</i>

01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:54.805
They'd rather sell their grapes to London,
or Stockholm

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:58.083
and think that that will erase all
the indignities that people have suffered.

01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:02.400
<i>And what kind of support have you
received here in Great Britain?</i>

01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:05.769
Here in Britain, we have the Transport and
General Workers Union support,

01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:09.042
<i>and they have endorsed our boycott.</i>

01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:13.722
<i>The dock loaders refuse to unload grapes.</i>

01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:15.121
What are you saying to me now?

01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:17.089
Wait a minute! We had a deal!

01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:19.567
Which is a great endorsement
of our boycott.

01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:24.725
<i>We're optimistic to have
similar support from other countries.</i>

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:29.044
<i>Diverse religious groups throughout the
continent have shown their support.</i>

01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:32.329
<i>Even the Pope has agreed to meet us.</i>

01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:34.880
I've got them grapes
halfway through the Atlantic.

01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:38.201
Hello?

01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:40.244
So, what are you hoping to achieve?

01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:44.411
<i>Well, it's never been
about the grapes.</i>

01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:45.841
<i>It's always been about the people.</i>

01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:48.566
<i>The poorest of the poor, the marginalized.</i>

01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:50.246
<i>The ones who have been ignored.</i>

01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:56.566
<i>There would be no food on the table
without these people.</i>

01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:04.287
<i>And these people have
names, faces, families.</i>

01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:10.762
<i>And I guess what we want to accomplish
is to give these people a voice.</i>

01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:23.569
<i>But will this be enough,
considering the amount of resistance?</i>

01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:26.448
Once social change begins,

01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:29.005
it can't be reversed.

01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:33.126
<i>You can't uneducate someone
who has learned how to read.</i>

01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:37.963
<i>You can't humiliate someone
who has pride.</i>

01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:46.768
You can't oppress someone
who is not afraid anymore.

01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:49.768
We have seen the future
and the future is ours.

01:27:58.320 --> 01:27:59.321
Ready?

01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:04.201
Don't answer it!

01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:05.447
I'm right here.

01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:09.288
Don't take three hours.
I have to drop this off.

01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:24.407
What's wrong?

01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:26.247
They want to sign.

01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:27.961
Who?

01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:31.802
All of them. All the growers want to sign.

01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:05.602
It's an interesting day
you choose to be late.

01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:08.849
Come on, they are waiting inside.

01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:50.841
You have to admit,
this old Croat put up a hell of a fight.

01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:55.161
Yeah, I can do that, as long as you can
admit this little Mexican kicked your ass.

01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:02.320
<i>Brothers and sisters of the fields,</i>

01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:07.171
<i>all around us were those
who said it could never be done.</i>

01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:12.367
<i>People said that
the growers were too powerful,</i>

01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:16.644
<i>the police would be against us...</i>

01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:20.209
And the courts would beat us down,

01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:22.520
and that sooner or later

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:25.564
we would fall back into the poverty
and despair of our forefathers.

01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:27.526
But we didn't!

01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:30.681
We didn't

01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:32.925
because our common suffering

01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:36.207
and love for each other kept us together.

01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:41.370
Five years we were on strike!

01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:48.163
It kept us sacrificing and fighting
for a better tomorrow,

01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:51.243
a better tomorrow that we all dream about

01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:54.202
as we work among these beautiful vines.

01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:58.889
And when millions and millions of
Americans stopped doing one thing,

01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:00.926
eating grapes,

01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:03.530
we won the strike!

01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:05.281
We won!

01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:12.810
Yes, we can!

01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:01.450
<i>I know there is no way
to justify the things that I've done...</i>

01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:03.929
<i>Or that I've not done for you.</i>

01:33:04.760 --> 01:33:06.649
<i>It saddens me to think that</i>

01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:09.281
<i>we never got a chance
to go fishing together</i>

01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:11.844
<i>or catch a baseball game</i>

01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:14.124
<i>or even go watch a movie.</i>

01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:18.088
<i>There's no way to turn back the clock</i>

01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:20.131
<i>and to make up for lost time.</i>

01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:23.601
<i>But I want you to know that</i>

01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:25.927
<i>your mother and I
miss you very much, Fernando.</i>

01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:29.649
<i>It seems so ironic to think that,</i>

01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:33.128
<i>because I've tried to do things that
my father could never do for us,</i>

01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:35.810
<i>I'm now so distant from you.</i>

01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:41.490
<i>Please know that
the day you came into this world</i>

01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:44.206
<i>was also the day that I
received the clarity</i>

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:46.729
<i>that I so desperately needed.</i>

01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:50.449
<i>You and your brothers and sisters</i>

01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:52.889
<i>are the purpose for my struggle.</i>

01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:55.330
<i>Everything I do is for you.</i>

01:33:56.520 --> 01:33:58.363
<i>And I hope you remember that.</i>

01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:02.160
<i>I also hope that one day</i>

01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:05.566
<i>you can be as proud of me as I am of you.</i>

01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:43.728
<i>But I want
more than anything else,</i>

01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:45.245
<i>I would like to see the poor</i>

01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:50.251
<i>take a very direct part in shaping society.</i>

01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:51.930
<i>And let them make the decisions.</i>

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:56.247
<i>And in our case, if the poor are not
involved, then change will never come.</i>
