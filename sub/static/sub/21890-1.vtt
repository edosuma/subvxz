00:53.754 --> 00:56.593
You can do this, Elliot.
Come on, you can do this.

00:56.595 --> 00:58.515
Elliot, you can do this.

01:04.114 --> 01:04.913
No, please!

01:04.915 --> 01:06.273
Elliot, Elliot, please, no!

01:06.275 --> 01:08.473
Please, Elliot, don't!

01:08.475 --> 01:09.632
Please, Elliot, you don't have
to do this.

01:09.634 --> 01:11.033
Please, Elliot!

01:11.035 --> 01:13.592
It isn't you, Elliot, please!

01:13.594 --> 01:14.754
Please, Elliot.

01:15.714 --> 01:17.074
Elliot, please!

01:20.035 --> 01:21.592
I can't look.

01:21.594 --> 01:22.553
Please, please!

01:22.555 --> 01:23.913
Please, he's your son, Elliot.

01:23.915 --> 01:26.553
Don't do this, please.
You don't have to. Don't!

01:26.555 --> 01:28.313
Don't!

01:28.315 --> 01:29.155
Don't!

01:44.555 --> 01:46.792
Where do you think
you're going, Miranda?

02:33.635 --> 02:34.475
Help me!

02:35.754 --> 02:36.594
No, no!

02:40.034 --> 02:41.432
Elliot!

02:41.434 --> 02:44.953
No! No!

02:44.955 --> 02:45.795
Help me!

03:21.994 --> 03:24.073
Are we nearly there?

03:24.075 --> 03:25.435
Nearly.

03:26.594 --> 03:29.192
Penny, you've
asked that like three times.

03:29.194 --> 03:31.513
It's not even
a long drive.

03:31.515 --> 03:34.755
We've only been driving
for like 30 minutes.

04:05.675 --> 04:06.673
We are here.

04:06.675 --> 04:08.515
Hurry up, out we go.

04:09.594 --> 04:10.634
Eric.

04:14.795 --> 04:15.753
Oh.

04:15.755 --> 04:17.875
Brand new start for us.

04:18.875 --> 04:19.714
Wow.

04:21.673 --> 04:23.514
Welcome to Elm Lake.

04:30.635 --> 04:32.433
Well I guess we should
get our stuff.

04:32.435 --> 04:35.672
Or, we go and explore?

04:35.674 --> 04:37.193
Yeah? Yeah?

04:37.195 --> 04:39.712
Come on, trouble, come on.

04:39.714 --> 04:40.833
Chop chop.

05:21.315 --> 05:22.755
This is amazing.

05:24.794 --> 05:26.633
What do you think?

05:26.635 --> 05:30.712
Wait, where did you find
the time to do all this?

05:30.714 --> 05:32.755
I just found the time.

05:35.034 --> 05:36.953
Well it does need
a bit more work.

05:36.955 --> 05:37.794
Really?

05:43.875 --> 05:46.273
I had to sign up
for 12 months though.

05:46.275 --> 05:50.112
But what the hell?
We'll make this work.

05:50.114 --> 05:50.954
Okay.

05:53.515 --> 05:54.792
Yeah, I love it.

05:54.794 --> 05:55.792
Really?

05:55.794 --> 05:57.552
Yeah, really.

05:57.554 --> 05:59.592
I was worried.

05:59.594 --> 06:01.114
No, I do love it.

06:02.714 --> 06:03.755
Thank you.

06:10.594 --> 06:11.434
Penny?

06:15.395 --> 06:17.712
So what do you think?

06:17.714 --> 06:19.234
I want that room.

06:20.794 --> 06:21.835
Cheeky.

06:25.995 --> 06:27.472
Eric?

06:27.474 --> 06:28.792
Hmm?

06:28.794 --> 06:29.835
Come here.

06:33.755 --> 06:35.995
This is for your man shed.

06:37.594 --> 06:39.592
Alright.

06:39.594 --> 06:40.434
I'll settle that tomorrow.

06:47.275 --> 06:48.833
Are you gonna pick that up?

06:48.835 --> 06:49.873
Take it, take it.

06:49.875 --> 06:51.472
I'll take you now, I'll take
you now.

06:51.474 --> 06:52.594
What? What?

06:53.635 --> 06:54.474
Eric!

07:13.635 --> 07:14.474
Malcolm?

07:16.714 --> 07:17.554
No.

07:21.435 --> 07:23.433
Sorry, I'm Eric.

07:23.435 --> 07:24.275
Mike.

07:28.195 --> 07:33.152
I'm sort of taking over when
Malcolm retires this week.

07:33.154 --> 07:36.193
I don't know what the
old boy promised you,

07:36.195 --> 07:40.792
but he never said nothing
to me about you taking over.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.712
I don't know who you are.

07:42.714 --> 07:43.755
Who are you?

07:44.794 --> 07:46.953
Where's Malcolm?

07:46.955 --> 07:48.953
I only spoke to him last week
about all of this.

07:48.955 --> 07:53.232
To be honest, you'd be
the last thing on his mind.

07:53.234 --> 07:54.674
He had a stroke.

07:56.275 --> 08:00.032
Found him under a car out there,
he did.

08:00.034 --> 08:03.393
But I run this place now, yeah.

08:03.395 --> 08:04.393
That doesn't seem fair.

08:04.395 --> 08:06.232
He was quite keen about me
taking over.

08:06.234 --> 08:08.912
If you wanna visit him,
you better take some flowers

08:08.914 --> 08:12.674
'cause he's up at
Splinters Mound Cemetery.

08:15.154 --> 08:17.474
Mike, I can fix anything.

08:18.674 --> 08:19.993
It's all my dad used to do.

08:19.995 --> 08:23.552
He used to own a garage
like this when he was alive.

08:23.554 --> 08:25.873
Me and my girlfriend, we just
moved into the house by the lake

08:25.875 --> 08:28.953
and, well, we're out of choices.

08:28.955 --> 08:30.193
Elm Lake?

08:30.195 --> 08:32.592
The house by the lake?

08:32.595 --> 08:33.434
Yeah.

08:35.275 --> 08:37.792
Bloody tragic, what went on.

08:37.794 --> 08:39.912
They ruined it
for the rest of us.

08:39.914 --> 08:41.552
My family moved in with
me a couple of days ago

08:41.554 --> 08:44.633
and we're loving it up there.

08:44.635 --> 08:46.952
Yeah, well you take care.

08:46.954 --> 08:49.672
You're all alone up there.

08:49.674 --> 08:51.834
No one can hear you scream.

08:54.995 --> 08:56.235
Mike, can I?

08:57.755 --> 08:59.314
Can I work for you?

09:02.515 --> 09:03.355
Right.

09:04.515 --> 09:06.393
There's a banger over there.

09:06.395 --> 09:07.912
I've been meaning to
change the brakes on it

09:07.914 --> 09:10.072
for the last two months.

09:10.074 --> 09:12.032
If you can get that
old thing going

09:12.034 --> 09:15.275
by the end of play today, you
got a job.

09:16.515 --> 09:17.955
Already on it.

09:20.995 --> 09:23.672
Everything's gonna
be fine now.

09:23.674 --> 09:26.434
Just like it was before.

09:28.074 --> 09:29.713
I know, Mom.

09:29.715 --> 09:31.233
I love it here.

09:31.235 --> 09:34.713
It feels like an
extra long holiday.

09:34.715 --> 09:36.672
Can I take the boat out
tomorrow?

09:36.674 --> 09:37.474
No.

09:38.715 --> 09:42.955
Not on your own,
no way.

09:45.395 --> 09:47.633
But maybe your dad can
take you out soon.

09:47.635 --> 09:48.713
Yes.

09:48.715 --> 09:49.713
Deal?

09:49.715 --> 09:50.993
Okay.

09:50.995 --> 09:52.435
Let's go to bed.

09:53.515 --> 09:54.554
Come on you.

12:00.275 --> 12:01.715
It's about time.

12:08.875 --> 12:09.715
Eric?

12:24.355 --> 12:26.195
Eric, are you there?

12:29.794 --> 12:31.034
Yeah.

12:35.074 --> 12:37.515
Can you come here for a sec?

12:44.715 --> 12:46.435
I got Penny to sleep.

12:48.875 --> 12:51.914
And you know she
doesn't sleep long.

13:00.115 --> 13:03.072
And what does
this mean?

13:03.074 --> 13:09.432
This means that we have some
time alone.

13:09.434 --> 13:10.434
Oh, do we?

13:27.275 --> 13:30.194
Oh.

14:16.834 --> 14:19.113
Eric, you okay?

14:19.115 --> 14:20.235
Yeah, yeah.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.314
Yeah, I'm fine.

14:39.034 --> 14:39.875
Eric.

14:41.194 --> 14:42.234
What was it?

14:44.275 --> 14:45.115
I saw,

14:46.154 --> 14:48.832
I thought I saw someone.

14:48.834 --> 14:49.674
Eric.

14:51.954 --> 14:52.794
Oh fuck.

15:16.314 --> 15:17.554
Daddy?

15:19.395 --> 15:20.314
Penny.

15:21.875 --> 15:24.393
Where did you get that?

15:24.395 --> 15:25.434
Found it.

15:27.194 --> 15:29.834
Go back to sleep, Penny, okay?

15:40.115 --> 15:40.955
Nothing?

15:43.034 --> 15:45.873
I swear I saw something,
someone.

15:45.875 --> 15:46.875
A man there.

15:50.515 --> 15:54.554
Well if you've checked
and there's nothing there...

15:59.834 --> 16:02.353
Let's just go to sleep, yeah?

16:02.355 --> 16:04.475
I'm not feeling too well.

16:06.395 --> 16:07.554
Yeah, okay.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.312
I love you.

16:11.314 --> 16:12.395
I love you.

16:36.235 --> 16:37.275
Don't worry.

16:38.034 --> 16:40.432
He didn't see you.

16:40.434 --> 16:41.755
You're my secret.

16:48.074 --> 16:48.914
Hey.

16:50.395 --> 16:51.235
Hon.

16:56.674 --> 16:57.672
You okay?

16:57.674 --> 16:58.834
Yeah, yeah.

17:00.515 --> 17:02.593
I had light sleep, I guess.

17:02.595 --> 17:03.834
My head kills.

17:04.874 --> 17:05.714
Um.

17:10.794 --> 17:13.354
Here you go, take one of these.

17:15.314 --> 17:17.352
Maybe have a hot shower
or something.

17:17.354 --> 17:18.515
Yeah, thanks.

17:19.915 --> 17:22.355
Ooh, that's good.

17:24.034 --> 17:25.632
Who's that?

17:25.634 --> 17:26.752
It's my friend.

17:26.755 --> 17:27.594
Who?

17:28.915 --> 17:29.953
Smithy.

17:29.955 --> 17:32.074
He gave me that doll too.

17:34.275 --> 17:38.433
It's her new friend and
apparently he lives here as well.

17:38.435 --> 17:39.275
Penny?

17:40.354 --> 17:42.433
We talked about this.

17:42.435 --> 17:45.032
We don't talk to imaginary
friends anymore, do we?

17:45.034 --> 17:46.032
Eric.

17:46.034 --> 17:49.475
Will you stop encouraging her,
please?

17:51.554 --> 17:52.394
Sorry.

17:53.475 --> 17:56.594
I think I will go
for that shower.

18:06.275 --> 18:08.072
Hi.

18:08.074 --> 18:11.314
Oh, come in.

18:11.554 --> 18:16.632
Oh, I must say,
this is a cute place.

18:16.634 --> 18:18.072
You think so?

18:18.074 --> 18:19.312
Do I think?

18:19.314 --> 18:20.154
Uh, yeah.

18:26.155 --> 18:27.675
Hey you, good pick.

18:31.515 --> 18:34.552
All right, shall I come back
another time?

18:34.554 --> 18:37.594
Oh no, he's just been unwell.
Don't worry.

18:39.634 --> 18:41.552
Okay, let's see the land then.

18:41.554 --> 18:43.074
Okay, let's go.

18:46.394 --> 18:48.273
I don't mean to be a
bitch but we both know

18:48.275 --> 18:50.632
you can't afford this.

18:50.634 --> 18:53.673
So it's either you won the
lottery or...

18:53.675 --> 18:54.515
Or?

18:55.995 --> 19:00.592
Or there's something
wrong with this place.

19:00.594 --> 19:03.513
Okay well, this is the part

19:03.515 --> 19:06.112
where you're gonna hate it.

19:06.114 --> 19:06.954
Why?

19:11.594 --> 19:16.153
Okay, apparently the family
that lived here before,

19:16.155 --> 19:20.115
the dad murdered the wife
and kid or something.

19:22.915 --> 19:23.755
Wow.

19:25.394 --> 19:26.434
Oh, come on.

19:28.275 --> 19:29.592
Say something.

19:29.594 --> 19:31.953
Well I don't know what to say
exactly.

19:31.955 --> 19:33.592
Oh it's not that bad.

19:33.594 --> 19:35.913
It isn't that bad?

19:35.915 --> 19:38.433
Haley, it's really bad.

19:38.435 --> 19:41.072
Well you know what I mean,
like,

19:41.074 --> 19:42.552
it happened years ago.

19:42.554 --> 19:44.995
No one's lived here since, so.

19:45.755 --> 19:48.233
How do you do it?

19:48.235 --> 19:50.074
How do you stay there?

19:51.594 --> 19:55.592
You know why, we can't
afford anywhere else.

19:55.594 --> 19:57.032
Besides, look at this.

19:57.034 --> 19:58.475
It is beautiful.

20:16.235 --> 20:17.552
Don't you think this whole
situation

20:17.554 --> 20:19.394
is moving really fast?

20:20.554 --> 20:22.832
Crys, please, just don't go
there, okay?

20:22.834 --> 20:25.072
Haley, I'm gonna go there.

20:25.074 --> 20:29.552
That man cheated on you
for over six months.

20:29.554 --> 20:32.832
Once a cheater, always
a cheater in my book.

20:32.834 --> 20:33.872
He's changed.

20:33.874 --> 20:35.233
Like really, he has.

20:35.235 --> 20:36.713
Really?

20:36.715 --> 20:38.592
Because that didn't seem fine.

20:38.594 --> 20:39.592
But we talked about it all.

20:39.594 --> 20:41.632
And I mean look what he's done
for us.

20:41.634 --> 20:42.632
Like this place.

20:42.634 --> 20:45.275
He's trying, like really hard.

20:46.675 --> 20:49.273
Look, just because
you have a kid together

20:49.275 --> 20:52.193
doesn't mean you have to
be together.

20:52.195 --> 20:54.112
You're a hot girl.

20:54.114 --> 20:55.753
Oh come on!

20:55.755 --> 20:58.392
You could do so much
better than that.

20:58.394 --> 20:59.754
Be your own boss.

21:00.715 --> 21:03.153
No, look, this is gonna be
good, okay?

21:03.155 --> 21:05.513
Like for all of us.

21:05.515 --> 21:08.634
As a family and it's just what
we need.

21:12.034 --> 21:14.913
Okay, so I've got to go.

21:14.915 --> 21:16.392
I've got a date.

21:16.394 --> 21:17.433
Oh.

21:17.435 --> 21:18.792
Yes.

21:18.794 --> 21:20.235
Anyone I know?

21:21.074 --> 21:23.552
Let's just say I'll tell you
all the

21:23.554 --> 21:25.394
naughty details later.

21:26.755 --> 21:28.872
Okay, then have fun.

21:28.874 --> 21:30.314
I will.

22:01.834 --> 22:04.275
Penny, what are you doing?

22:18.394 --> 22:20.792
It's really scary.

22:20.794 --> 22:23.592
What happened?

22:23.594 --> 22:24.714
I died.

22:25.715 --> 22:26.755
Penny.

22:27.874 --> 22:30.032
Wait, when?

22:30.034 --> 22:31.832
Seven years ago.

22:31.834 --> 22:33.552
Who?

22:33.554 --> 22:34.674
My dad.

22:43.794 --> 22:44.913
Penny.

22:44.915 --> 22:48.235
Mom, you scared him away.

22:48.594 --> 22:49.634
He's gone now.

22:51.074 --> 22:51.914
What?

22:53.354 --> 22:56.713
Smithy, he doesn't like
when other people are around.

22:56.715 --> 22:58.792
He only likes me.

22:58.794 --> 23:00.832
Oh come on, Penny, Smithy
isn't real.

23:00.834 --> 23:01.913
Yes he is.

23:01.915 --> 23:03.355
He's behind you.

23:13.794 --> 23:15.832
There's nobody there.

23:15.834 --> 23:17.755
Shut up, you're stupid.

23:18.915 --> 23:21.832
All right, get to bed now.

23:21.834 --> 23:23.753
Penny, now, I mean it.

23:23.755 --> 23:26.392
It's late, I've had enough.

23:26.394 --> 23:27.234
Now!

25:11.195 --> 25:12.713
I did it.

25:12.715 --> 25:15.832
They are gone now,
I will follow them.

25:15.834 --> 25:19.874
I will be with them for I
have Lucifer's blood in me.

25:57.155 --> 25:59.753
Light always needs a
source of energy.

25:59.755 --> 26:01.913
Darkness does not need a
source of energy

26:01.915 --> 26:05.792
therefore darkness will always
beat light.

26:05.794 --> 26:07.273
He owns this house.

26:07.275 --> 26:09.513
This was where generations
of his followers

26:09.515 --> 26:13.155
have slain and appreciated
him for his work.

26:58.874 --> 27:03.112
I obey him yet questioned him
and for this

27:03.114 --> 27:06.072
he inflicted a great deal
of suffering upon me.

27:06.074 --> 27:08.872
And I have not left the house
for days

27:08.874 --> 27:10.714
due to that suffering.

27:33.995 --> 27:35.872
My commitment has been said to
be proved

27:35.874 --> 27:38.114
if I grant him my last wish.

27:39.114 --> 27:43.154
To slay my family so they
follow my path and not God's.

28:10.155 --> 28:11.153
Hey.

28:11.155 --> 28:13.632
Shh, be quiet, they're asleep.

28:13.634 --> 28:15.312
Look at the moon tonight.

28:15.314 --> 28:16.312
Wait, he's out there.

28:16.314 --> 28:17.913
Did you see anything?

28:17.915 --> 28:21.112
What? No one.

28:21.114 --> 28:21.954
Why?

28:23.235 --> 28:24.513
I'm just freaking myself out.

28:24.515 --> 28:26.193
Come in.

28:26.195 --> 28:27.153
Okay.

28:27.155 --> 28:27.995
Quick.

28:30.834 --> 28:32.995
So, what was so urgent?

28:37.114 --> 28:38.474
I found this.

28:39.354 --> 28:44.072
It's a journal and I think
it belonged to that man,

28:44.074 --> 28:45.312
you know, the man who
lived here before.

28:45.314 --> 28:47.552
Holy shit, let me look.

28:47.554 --> 28:50.713
It just really freaked me out.

28:50.715 --> 28:53.832
I think maybe I need to
just find out what happened.

28:53.834 --> 28:54.874
Oh my god.

28:59.155 --> 28:59.995
Lucifer?

29:03.354 --> 29:07.792
This is so messed up.

29:07.794 --> 29:09.235
I know.

29:27.475 --> 29:28.715
Mom.

29:30.874 --> 29:32.632
Hang on, I'll just go and see
to her

29:32.634 --> 29:34.554
and I'll be back, okay?

29:45.915 --> 29:46.955
Oh my god.

30:12.034 --> 30:14.995
Okay, go.

30:16.755 --> 30:19.392
What became known locally
as the Massacre at Elm Lake,

30:19.394 --> 30:22.032
the family's bodies were
discovered by a dog walker

30:22.034 --> 30:23.993
in the early hours
of the morning

30:23.995 --> 30:26.473
in the lake outside
of the house.

30:26.475 --> 30:30.193
Their bodies had been
drained of blood.

30:30.195 --> 30:32.273
The father Elliot Mandres had
shot himself

30:32.275 --> 30:36.515
after brutally slaying his
wife and 12 year old son.

30:40.235 --> 30:42.953
Mrs. Mandres, Miranda had
been discovered decapitated

30:42.955 --> 30:44.592
at the scene of the crime.

30:44.594 --> 30:46.832
It was thought that Elliot
Mandres had been dabbling

30:46.834 --> 30:49.993
with witchcraft and satanism

30:49.995 --> 30:53.713
and was sacrificing his
family to the devil.

30:53.715 --> 30:55.993
He had become increasingly
isolated in the weeks

30:55.995 --> 30:58.713
leading up to the events
of that gruesome night.

30:58.715 --> 31:00.312
And few friends or family
had contact

31:00.314 --> 31:02.233
with the Mandreses for
a while beforehand.

31:02.235 --> 31:03.993
Stop, okay, no.

31:03.995 --> 31:04.993
It's nearly finished.

31:04.995 --> 31:07.235
No, I can't hear any more.

31:10.195 --> 31:12.433
It's fucked up, right?

31:12.435 --> 31:13.993
Yeah.

31:13.995 --> 31:15.235
I don't like it.

31:21.275 --> 31:23.273
So I got you something.

31:26.354 --> 31:28.995
Kill, kill, kill!

31:30.314 --> 31:31.154
Kill!

31:37.594 --> 31:38.753
It's nothing big.

31:38.755 --> 31:40.872
It's just a little
housewarming present.

31:40.874 --> 31:43.314
I think it's the perfect time.

31:57.874 --> 31:59.392
If the spirits are chilling in
your house

31:59.394 --> 32:04.193
then the least they can
do is talk to us, right?

32:04.195 --> 32:05.792
Don't you think this
is a little bit stupid?

32:05.794 --> 32:08.872
Don't you wanna know
what happened?

32:08.874 --> 32:11.792
Listen, we tell them we're
not gonna do them any harm.

32:11.794 --> 32:14.955
You just wanna know
why they're here.

32:16.034 --> 32:18.513
Haven't you always been
curious to try one of these?

32:18.515 --> 32:20.072
Not really, no.

32:20.074 --> 32:21.312
Not even a little bit?

32:21.314 --> 32:22.592
No.

32:22.594 --> 32:24.352
Well, we're gonna do it.

32:24.354 --> 32:27.473
So hand on it.

32:27.475 --> 32:28.314
Go on.

32:30.275 --> 32:32.112
Clear your mind.

32:32.114 --> 32:34.193
Let go of any thoughts.

32:35.235 --> 32:36.475
Hey, be serious.

32:37.354 --> 32:39.072
Okay, okay sorry.

32:39.074 --> 32:39.914
Relax.

32:40.955 --> 32:42.675
Allow the spirits in.

32:43.755 --> 32:46.513
Allow them to use your body.

32:46.515 --> 32:49.433
Allow them to enter your mind

32:49.435 --> 32:52.032
to send us their message.

32:52.034 --> 32:55.314
Allow their voices to be heard.

33:02.995 --> 33:03.834
Don't...

33:07.675 --> 33:08.515
be...

33:09.995 --> 33:11.513
This is you.

33:11.515 --> 33:12.473
No.

33:12.475 --> 33:13.635
No, it's not.

33:26.475 --> 33:27.433
Scared.

33:30.955 --> 33:32.115
Who was that?

33:46.675 --> 33:47.753
Miranda.

33:47.755 --> 33:48.594
Help me.

34:09.793 --> 34:11.755
Why are you not safe?

34:16.034 --> 34:17.074
I'm sorry.

34:19.514 --> 34:22.474
Well I guess you
found your spirit.

34:23.474 --> 34:24.514
Put it away.

35:36.555 --> 35:37.395
What?

35:39.075 --> 35:42.273
Oh sorry, were you working?

35:42.275 --> 35:44.514
No I'm not going in today.

35:46.555 --> 35:51.432
Listen, I've booked us
a babysitter for tonight.

35:51.434 --> 35:55.073
I think we should get
out, just the two of us.

35:55.075 --> 35:57.395
Just get out of that house.

35:58.195 --> 36:00.354
Are you feeling up to it?

36:01.195 --> 36:02.352
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:02.354 --> 36:05.635
That's a great idea.

36:08.115 --> 36:09.312
Okay.

36:09.314 --> 36:13.352
Penny's here, do you wanna speak
to her?

36:13.354 --> 36:15.554
Um, just say hi.

36:16.715 --> 36:18.155
Okay.

36:24.675 --> 36:26.593
Mom, I don't feel well.

36:26.595 --> 36:28.593
Oh, it's just 'cause
you're nervous.

36:28.595 --> 36:31.872
It's gonna be fine,
it'll be fun, first day.

36:31.874 --> 36:34.512
They won't like me.

36:34.514 --> 36:35.633
Of course they'll like you.

36:35.635 --> 36:37.553
Everybody likes you.

36:37.555 --> 36:40.113
No they won't, he told me.

36:40.115 --> 36:43.633
They're horrible, mean,
they won't like me.

36:43.635 --> 36:45.113
Who said that?

36:45.115 --> 36:45.955
Smithy.

36:48.715 --> 36:50.633
I love you, mom.

36:50.635 --> 36:51.794
Wait, kiss.

36:53.635 --> 36:54.633
Have a really good time.

36:54.635 --> 36:55.633
Bye.

36:55.635 --> 36:57.195
All right, bye.

37:31.155 --> 37:32.233
Hayley Jones?

37:32.235 --> 37:33.275
Hi, Julie.

37:39.195 --> 37:41.512
Thank you so much for coming.

37:41.514 --> 37:43.634
You're welcome, sweety.

37:47.394 --> 37:51.634
I'm a bit scared of the
house we just moved into.

37:52.474 --> 37:55.832
It's the Lake House on Elm Lake.

37:55.834 --> 37:58.633
Apparently a family lived there
before

37:58.635 --> 38:01.713
and some really bad things
happened.

38:01.715 --> 38:04.633
I think the father murdered
the mother and the child

38:04.635 --> 38:08.912
and I can't explain it
but I just,

38:08.914 --> 38:10.912
I feel there's something there,

38:10.914 --> 38:13.193
like there's something
not right.

38:13.195 --> 38:15.432
And what have you
felt exactly?

38:15.434 --> 38:18.832
Have there been any
manifestations at all?

38:18.834 --> 38:23.512
No, my partner Eric
thought he saw something.

38:23.514 --> 38:24.992
But ever since we moved there,

38:24.994 --> 38:27.832
he's just been acting
really, really strange.

38:27.834 --> 38:30.673
Like he came down with
these flu like symptoms

38:30.675 --> 38:32.753
when we moved in.

38:32.755 --> 38:35.994
And he just seems to be
getting worse.

38:36.755 --> 38:38.113
I know it sounds silly but it
just seems

38:38.115 --> 38:41.035
like he's changing,
he's different.

38:44.954 --> 38:47.832
Evil can manifest itself in
many ways.

38:47.834 --> 38:50.432
It's within us all but
it can only come forth

38:50.434 --> 38:51.594
if we allow it.

38:57.434 --> 38:59.074
Kill.

39:02.834 --> 39:03.675
Kill.

39:08.794 --> 39:09.635
Kill.

39:10.874 --> 39:12.635
You all right, bud?

39:15.235 --> 39:17.474
Kill, kill.

39:53.994 --> 39:56.792
And there are dark forces at
work here.

39:56.794 --> 39:58.832
Have you spoken to
another medium?

39:58.834 --> 40:01.153
Try to communicate in any way?

40:01.155 --> 40:04.872
Actually me and my friend,
we did a ouija board thing.

40:04.874 --> 40:06.992
These things aren't
meant as games.

40:06.994 --> 40:09.832
They can bring forth spirits
from another dimension.

40:09.834 --> 40:13.872
We spoke to this lady,
Miranda.

40:13.874 --> 40:16.312
And it was like she was trying
to help us.

40:16.314 --> 40:20.753
She was warning us about some
evil spirit in the house.

40:20.755 --> 40:21.912
Well they may seem like
they're friendly

40:21.914 --> 40:23.912
but there's no way to know
their motives

40:23.914 --> 40:26.792
when they reach forth
in this way.

40:26.794 --> 40:28.233
I need to evaluate the house.

40:28.235 --> 40:31.792
I have to come and see what I
can sense,

40:31.794 --> 40:33.952
see if I can feel anything.

40:33.954 --> 40:36.593
Please do not use that
board again.

40:36.595 --> 40:38.073
They are desperately dangerous.

40:38.075 --> 40:39.512
They shouldn't be used by people

40:39.514 --> 40:41.874
who aren't trained to resist.

40:43.675 --> 40:44.515
Yeah.

42:11.275 --> 42:13.832
Hello, hi, come in, welcome.

42:13.834 --> 42:14.912
Oh my god, it's freezing.

42:14.914 --> 42:15.954
Penny?

42:17.115 --> 42:18.273
I'm Hayley.

42:18.275 --> 42:20.033
Nice to meet you,
nice to meet you.

42:20.035 --> 42:21.033
Thanks for coming.

42:21.035 --> 42:21.832
That's all right.

42:21.834 --> 42:23.153
Penny, this is
Bethany.

42:23.155 --> 42:24.233
Hiya, you're all right.

42:24.235 --> 42:26.155
Hi, nice to meet you.

42:27.514 --> 42:29.952
She's a bit shy, sorry.

42:29.954 --> 42:31.033
And this is Eric.

42:31.035 --> 42:32.753
Hey, Eric, nice to meet you.

42:32.755 --> 42:34.233
Nice to meet you.

42:34.235 --> 42:35.472
So we'll be back about 10.

42:35.474 --> 42:36.992
Give me a hug.

42:36.994 --> 42:38.914
Right, be good, okay?

42:40.595 --> 42:41.673
Thank you so much.

42:41.675 --> 42:42.472
See you.

42:42.474 --> 42:43.273
See you later.

42:43.275 --> 42:45.314
See you, bye.

42:55.715 --> 42:57.673
It's nice.

42:57.675 --> 42:59.633
Yeah, it is, isn't it.

42:59.635 --> 43:01.593
Yeah, thank you for
sorting it out.

43:01.595 --> 43:02.633
It's okay.

43:02.635 --> 43:04.555
It's been long overdue.

43:07.715 --> 43:09.753
I know, well I meant
to be seeing him tonight

43:09.755 --> 43:12.994
but I don't think that's gonna
happen.

43:15.035 --> 43:16.033
Yeah, yeah yeah.

43:16.035 --> 43:17.432
Well hopefully I'll see you
later anyway.

43:17.434 --> 43:18.952
Yup, okay.

43:18.954 --> 43:20.594
Bye, bye bye, bye.

43:27.874 --> 43:29.033
Who are you talking to?

43:29.035 --> 43:29.875
My friend.

43:31.075 --> 43:32.753
What friend?
There's no one there.

43:32.755 --> 43:34.193
He's right there.

43:34.195 --> 43:36.113
Penny, there's literally
no one there.

43:36.115 --> 43:37.233
What are you on about?

43:37.235 --> 43:38.995
That wasn't nice.

43:40.275 --> 43:41.792
I'm not nice?

43:41.794 --> 43:43.153
I'm taking care of you.

43:43.155 --> 43:44.995
I'm looking after you.

43:48.235 --> 43:50.593
He says you're not safe here.

43:50.595 --> 43:53.113
Well tell him to piss off.

43:53.115 --> 43:55.033
You said a naughty word.

43:55.035 --> 43:56.872
Do you wanna know something?

43:56.874 --> 43:58.033
What?

43:58.035 --> 44:00.073
Do you know who
Smithy's dad was?

44:00.075 --> 44:01.753
He was a bad man.

44:01.755 --> 44:03.314
And you know why?

44:04.275 --> 44:06.673
Do you know outside
your bedroom,

44:06.675 --> 44:09.193
he shot himself in the head
after killing his family

44:09.195 --> 44:10.314
with a knife.

44:11.075 --> 44:14.314
Anyway, bedtime, let's go.

44:23.954 --> 44:24.794
Eric.

44:26.514 --> 44:28.512
We're okay, aren't we?

44:28.514 --> 44:30.193
Of course.

44:30.195 --> 44:32.273
I know it's been
difficult lately

44:32.275 --> 44:36.472
with moving in and Penny
and everything

44:36.474 --> 44:38.113
that's been going on.

44:38.115 --> 44:39.035
I love you.

44:40.314 --> 44:42.755
I won't do what I did again.

44:43.794 --> 44:44.635
I mean it.

44:45.555 --> 44:47.794
I'm yours and you're mine.

44:49.914 --> 44:51.073
It was a stupid thing.

44:51.075 --> 44:55.435
I just, I was in a bad place.

44:56.675 --> 44:58.995
I wasn't thinking straight.

45:00.155 --> 45:00.995
I know.

45:02.874 --> 45:05.512
Having Penny,
don't get me wrong.

45:05.514 --> 45:06.952
I love that girl to pieces.

45:06.954 --> 45:10.194
And I wouldn't change her for
the world.

45:11.235 --> 45:14.792
But I think having
a child that young

45:14.794 --> 45:17.713
made me freak out, you know.

45:17.715 --> 45:19.273
I jumped to the first
thing that felt

45:19.275 --> 45:22.994
like an escape and I
messed up, I really did.

45:24.755 --> 45:26.075
But I love you.

45:28.555 --> 45:31.995
And I can't imagine losing you,
not again.

45:33.994 --> 45:36.034
I love you too.

47:17.994 --> 47:18.992
Oh my god!

47:18.994 --> 47:20.992
Get up now, get up now!

47:20.994 --> 47:22.633
What's going on?

47:27.075 --> 47:29.193
Oh my god.
It's gonna be okay.

47:29.195 --> 47:30.193
Where's my dad?

47:30.195 --> 47:33.193
Stay here, stay here, okay?

47:38.794 --> 47:41.635
You're in
my house.

47:43.035 --> 47:44.233
Get out!

49:56.394 --> 49:58.113
Well, yeah I do.

49:58.115 --> 50:00.073
I mainly eat what
you don't finish.

50:00.075 --> 50:02.312
I know, I noticed.

50:02.314 --> 50:03.753
The trick is to shut your
door now.

50:03.755 --> 50:05.794
Lock it like four times.

50:06.555 --> 50:07.593
Inside?

50:07.595 --> 50:08.435
Yeah.

50:17.075 --> 50:18.155
Penny!

50:19.675 --> 50:20.394
Eric!

50:21.954 --> 50:23.553
Penny?

50:23.555 --> 50:24.952
Penny, where are you?

50:24.954 --> 50:26.432
Penny!

50:26.434 --> 50:27.674
Eric!

50:35.555 --> 50:36.713
Penny! He's got Penny.

50:36.715 --> 50:38.392
What, who, who?

50:38.394 --> 50:39.553
That man!

50:39.555 --> 50:41.792
What man? Who are you
talking about? What man?

50:41.794 --> 50:42.914
Penny! Penny!

50:43.994 --> 50:45.154
Where is she?

50:47.035 --> 50:48.352
Eric, Eric!

50:48.354 --> 50:51.432
Eric, look at me.
What the hell is going on?

50:51.434 --> 50:52.472
What is going on?

50:52.474 --> 50:53.634
He's got her.

50:57.474 --> 50:58.633
Penny.

50:58.635 --> 51:01.153
Penny, where are you?

51:34.314 --> 51:36.033
Penny, you okay?

51:36.035 --> 51:37.593
What happened? What happened?

51:37.595 --> 51:39.832
Mom, I don't feel well.

51:39.834 --> 51:41.713
What happened?

51:41.715 --> 51:43.193
Where's Beth, where is she?

51:43.195 --> 51:45.512
She left with a man.

51:45.514 --> 51:46.474
What man?

51:47.474 --> 51:48.914
I heard a man.

51:51.075 --> 51:52.472
For God's sake!

51:52.474 --> 51:53.474
Eric!

51:56.954 --> 51:57.952
Come on, it's okay.

51:57.954 --> 51:59.952
It's okay now.

51:59.954 --> 52:01.674
He did a bad thing.

52:03.874 --> 52:05.633
I know, I know.

52:05.635 --> 52:07.275
It's okay now, okay?

52:23.474 --> 52:24.314
Come here.

52:47.354 --> 52:48.195
Eric.

52:53.994 --> 52:56.792
This was all your idea,
wasn't it?

52:56.794 --> 52:58.472
You don't know what the hell
you're doing,

52:58.474 --> 53:00.073
leaving our child alone
with a complete stranger,

53:00.075 --> 53:01.715
you don't even know.

53:03.954 --> 53:05.633
Now look what's happened.

53:05.635 --> 53:07.033
Wait, how can you just start
blaming me

53:07.035 --> 53:09.113
for all of this?

53:09.115 --> 53:11.593
Where did you even find her,
hmm?

53:11.595 --> 53:14.715
I don't know,
she came recommended.

53:15.555 --> 53:18.233
No, she wasn't just some random
girl off the street, Eric,

53:18.235 --> 53:21.352
I didn't know she was gonna
run off like that, did I?

53:21.354 --> 53:23.352
Right, I saw the way you
looked at me when she arrived.

53:23.354 --> 53:25.633
Those eyes, that look you do.

53:25.635 --> 53:26.792
Every time there's another girl
around

53:26.794 --> 53:29.113
you always think I'm gonna fuck
her!

53:29.115 --> 53:30.593
I don't know what you're
talking about.

53:30.595 --> 53:33.035
You're insecure, constantly.

53:36.954 --> 53:38.994
Well can you blame me?

53:40.474 --> 53:43.514
You're right, maybe I don't
trust you.

53:46.075 --> 53:48.715
Because you cheated on me, Eric.

53:50.834 --> 53:52.474
You cheated on me.

53:54.595 --> 53:56.713
You were prepared to throw
away absolutely everything

53:56.715 --> 53:57.874
that we have.

53:59.755 --> 54:01.553
And when we moved here,
you promised me,

54:01.555 --> 54:02.952
you promised that
things would change,

54:02.954 --> 54:05.633
there would be
a brand new start.

54:05.635 --> 54:07.633
But no, of course
I don't bloody trust you.

54:07.635 --> 54:08.593
Shut the fuck up!

54:08.595 --> 54:10.392
Don't do that.

54:10.394 --> 54:11.992
Don't open your fucking mouth.

54:11.994 --> 54:14.154
I can't even look at you.

54:15.434 --> 54:17.312
Look, I want this more
than anything in the world,

54:17.314 --> 54:19.713
but I can't see much of a future
with you

54:19.715 --> 54:22.755
if you won't even bloody
talk to me!

54:24.834 --> 54:26.713
Eric, I can't do this on my own.

54:26.715 --> 54:28.992
I can't save our relationship
on my own.

54:28.994 --> 54:30.834
I need you to help me.

54:34.115 --> 54:36.155
Please, just look at me.

55:26.595 --> 55:27.755
Hey, princess.

55:29.035 --> 55:31.795
I thought that you
were sleeping.

55:33.434 --> 55:34.674
I can't sleep.

55:37.394 --> 55:39.715
Look Penny, I'm so sorry.

55:42.555 --> 55:44.113
I'll never leave you again
like that.

55:44.115 --> 55:45.555
I promise, okay?

55:46.834 --> 55:48.554
Let me have a look.

56:01.235 --> 56:02.075
This one.

56:12.075 --> 56:13.553
Don't worry.

56:13.555 --> 56:16.193
Can you just sleep with me now?

56:16.195 --> 56:17.235
Are you sad?

56:19.195 --> 56:20.035
No.

56:21.394 --> 56:22.434
I'm not sad.

56:25.195 --> 56:26.792
Mommy's fine, okay?

56:26.794 --> 56:27.834
Don't worry.

56:29.635 --> 56:30.755
I love you.

56:32.715 --> 56:34.075
I love you too.

56:37.914 --> 56:39.634
I love you so much.

56:43.275 --> 56:45.512
Do you wanna come and
sleep in my bed tonight?

56:45.514 --> 56:46.713
Yeah.

56:46.715 --> 56:47.952
Yes?

56:47.954 --> 56:49.553
Yeah.

56:49.555 --> 56:51.794
Okay, come on, let's go.

57:02.874 --> 57:04.834
Hey, thanks for coming.

57:07.994 --> 57:09.713
Hayley.

57:09.715 --> 57:11.512
Thank you so much for coming.

57:11.514 --> 57:14.554
Oh, you're welcome sweety,
thanks.

57:16.834 --> 57:20.074
Um, yes this is the place.

57:21.834 --> 57:24.275
And this is my partner Eric.

57:25.434 --> 57:26.994
Hello, I'm Julie.

57:28.874 --> 57:29.715
All right.

57:31.954 --> 57:33.633
Mom?

57:33.635 --> 57:36.794
Sorry, I'll just,
I'll be a second.

57:40.115 --> 57:43.354
Do you mind if I
take a look around?

57:44.474 --> 57:45.314
Yeah.

57:48.354 --> 57:50.312
Do you like that?

57:50.314 --> 57:52.874
I knew you always wanted to go.

57:56.555 --> 57:57.875
Hello, Penny.

57:59.115 --> 58:01.432
How are you feeling?

58:01.434 --> 58:04.474
I heard you had quite a
night of it.

58:05.434 --> 58:07.755
Yeah, there was a man here.

58:10.874 --> 58:12.912
What did he look like?

58:12.914 --> 58:15.553
He doesn't like me.

58:15.555 --> 58:18.673
He wanted to take me into the
forest away,

58:18.675 --> 58:20.314
away from my family.

58:23.555 --> 58:26.115
Do you mind if I take a look?

58:30.914 --> 58:33.954
It started ever since we
moved in.

58:39.954 --> 58:42.352
You've been an angel, Penny.

58:42.354 --> 58:44.832
Can you tell me where this man
is now?

58:44.834 --> 58:47.235
Can you see him at the moment?

58:49.914 --> 58:50.834
He's there.

58:59.035 --> 59:00.875
Wait here, please.

59:04.555 --> 59:05.595
It's okay.

01:00:18.514 --> 01:00:19.354
What?

01:00:20.235 --> 01:00:21.753
Julie, what's happening?

01:00:21.755 --> 01:00:23.553
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:00:23.555 --> 01:00:25.753
I have to get out of this house!

01:00:25.755 --> 01:00:26.952
What?

01:00:26.954 --> 01:00:28.432
Wait, wait, wait, Julie, Julie.

01:00:28.434 --> 01:00:30.154
Julie, please, Julie!

01:00:34.595 --> 01:00:35.834
What happened?

01:00:38.474 --> 01:00:39.914
What a nutjob.

01:00:41.755 --> 01:00:45.474
Another one of your
bright ideas, Hayley.

01:01:04.354 --> 01:01:05.195
What?

01:01:24.275 --> 01:01:26.673
Um, I'm going out, but
Crystal's gonna come over

01:01:26.675 --> 01:01:28.314
to look after Penny.

01:01:30.115 --> 01:01:30.955
Right.

01:01:37.794 --> 01:01:39.834
Eric, what's going on?

01:01:41.635 --> 01:01:43.312
I just want us to be like we
used to be.

01:01:43.314 --> 01:01:44.755
Please, come on.

01:01:47.275 --> 01:01:49.633
Tell me what's wrong.

01:02:04.155 --> 01:02:04.995
No!

01:02:11.075 --> 01:02:11.915
Fine.

01:02:13.075 --> 01:02:13.915
Fine.

01:02:14.715 --> 01:02:15.755
Come here.

01:02:17.195 --> 01:02:18.115
Eric, Eric!

01:02:21.635 --> 01:02:22.753
What are you doing?

01:02:24.195 --> 01:02:25.035
Eric.

01:02:32.195 --> 01:02:33.235
Oh Eric, Eric.

01:03:42.275 --> 01:03:43.914
How are you feeling?

01:03:45.394 --> 01:03:46.634
I feel sick.

01:03:49.195 --> 01:03:50.035
Look.

01:03:52.635 --> 01:03:55.354
Mommy's got to go out soon,
okay?

01:03:57.155 --> 01:04:00.595
But it's just gonna be for an
hour or two.

01:04:01.715 --> 01:04:04.472
If it wasn't important I
wouldn't go.

01:04:04.474 --> 01:04:06.832
But I really have to go.

01:04:06.834 --> 01:04:11.074
But Auntie Crystal is gonna
come and look after you, okay?

01:04:13.834 --> 01:04:18.273
Tomorrow,
we are gonna leave here.

01:04:18.275 --> 01:04:21.312
We're gonna get out
of this house.

01:04:21.314 --> 01:04:25.354
And everything's gonna be
back to the way it was before.

01:04:27.434 --> 01:04:28.275
I promise.

01:04:29.874 --> 01:04:32.233
Daddy's scaring me.

01:04:32.235 --> 01:04:35.275
He's angry,
shouts at me all the time.

01:04:36.595 --> 01:04:37.715
He's not dad.

01:04:39.235 --> 01:04:41.195
Of course it's Daddy.

01:04:43.195 --> 01:04:47.233
He's just not been very
well at the moment, has he?

01:04:47.235 --> 01:04:48.755
He loves you, yeah.

01:04:50.555 --> 01:04:51.475
We both do.

01:04:52.354 --> 01:04:53.275
I love you.

01:04:54.354 --> 01:04:56.195
I love you too, Mom.

01:05:06.514 --> 01:05:08.273
This better be good.

01:05:08.275 --> 01:05:10.553
I just had a really hot date.

01:05:10.555 --> 01:05:12.593
Sorry, I didn't mean to
call you out like this.

01:05:12.595 --> 01:05:15.472
I just don't want them to be on
their own.

01:05:15.474 --> 01:05:16.553
What's going on?

01:05:16.555 --> 01:05:17.792
Are you okay?

01:05:17.794 --> 01:05:18.912
Yeah, yeah I'm fine.

01:05:18.914 --> 01:05:22.593
I just need to go see
someone urgently, and.

01:05:22.595 --> 01:05:24.432
Yeah, we'll be fine.

01:05:24.434 --> 01:05:25.275
Yeah.

01:05:26.155 --> 01:05:28.233
What have you been doing?

01:05:28.235 --> 01:05:29.794
Dunno, men stuff.

01:05:31.434 --> 01:05:32.275
Okay.

01:05:34.155 --> 01:05:35.392
Um, just look after Penny, okay?

01:05:35.394 --> 01:05:36.434
Of course.

01:05:38.035 --> 01:05:40.512
I'll go and get us a takeout.

01:05:40.514 --> 01:05:42.074
You go do that.

01:05:49.235 --> 01:05:51.792
Thank you for coming.

01:05:51.794 --> 01:05:53.153
I've been so worried.

01:05:53.155 --> 01:05:57.392
She just won't leave the
church, keeps asking for you.

01:05:57.394 --> 01:05:59.354
Please do go, go and see.

01:06:00.474 --> 01:06:01.914
Thank you, yeah.

01:06:14.275 --> 01:06:16.033
That was a good takeout.

01:06:16.035 --> 01:06:16.875
Yeah.

01:06:25.994 --> 01:06:29.634
Uh, I'd better go
check on the little one.

01:06:33.514 --> 01:06:35.354
Uh, do you wanna go?

01:06:41.555 --> 01:06:42.995
Uh, Eric.

01:06:48.155 --> 01:06:49.715
What are you doing?

01:06:57.354 --> 01:06:59.994
Eric, I don't think we should.

01:07:02.675 --> 01:07:07.593
She doesn't know you
were the one I slept with.

01:07:07.595 --> 01:07:10.955
I know you think about me
like this.

01:07:12.474 --> 01:07:14.394
I know you want me.

01:07:20.434 --> 01:07:21.554
Are you okay?

01:07:23.434 --> 01:07:24.954
Hayley, Hayley.

01:07:27.474 --> 01:07:31.872
Hayley, it's not safe, it's
not safe in that house.

01:07:31.874 --> 01:07:34.594
What it's done,
what lives there.

01:07:35.755 --> 01:07:36.595
It's evil.

01:07:37.994 --> 01:07:41.794
You have to get your family
out of there immediately.

01:07:43.314 --> 01:07:45.113
Is this Eric?

01:07:45.115 --> 01:07:47.155
What did he do? Tell me?

01:07:58.354 --> 01:08:00.432
Harder, harder!

01:08:00.434 --> 01:08:01.554
Hard, harder!

01:08:04.595 --> 01:08:07.035
There's a spirit, an entity.

01:08:08.155 --> 01:08:12.033
It's a force like
nothing I felt before.

01:08:12.035 --> 01:08:13.675
And it's taken Eric.

01:08:14.514 --> 01:08:17.912
That's not your partner anymore.

01:08:17.915 --> 01:08:21.912
Whatever is inside Eric
now is not his soul.

01:08:25.434 --> 01:08:26.554
Eric! Eric!

01:08:35.154 --> 01:08:36.312
Eric, stop.

01:08:36.314 --> 01:08:37.872
Stop it.

01:08:37.875 --> 01:08:39.551
Eric, you're hurting me.

01:08:39.554 --> 01:08:40.993
Eric, Eric!

01:08:46.474 --> 01:08:48.234
What are you doing?

01:08:49.314 --> 01:08:50.634
Penny, help me!

01:08:55.234 --> 01:08:57.671
You have been a bad girl,
Penny.

01:08:57.674 --> 01:08:59.434
You should be asleep!

01:09:01.634 --> 01:09:03.631
It's his body.

01:09:03.634 --> 01:09:05.154
But not his spirit.

01:09:06.194 --> 01:09:10.715
Lucifer needs a host to return.

01:09:11.955 --> 01:09:13.875
He means to rise again.

01:09:16.554 --> 01:09:20.631
The only way to stop this,
to stop him gaining power

01:09:20.634 --> 01:09:22.274
is to kill the host.

01:09:24.075 --> 01:09:26.234
That's how you stop this.

01:10:18.235 --> 01:10:19.075
Shh.

01:10:31.955 --> 01:10:34.113
By the hand of Lucifer
and the kingdom

01:10:34.115 --> 01:10:36.153
that brings the light
from the dark,

01:10:36.155 --> 01:10:38.793
take this body and replace
with thy child,

01:10:38.795 --> 01:10:40.472
and take his life,

01:10:40.474 --> 01:10:43.592
and make him replenish with
all evil and bring him to life.

01:10:43.594 --> 01:10:45.634
Take my offering, Lucifer!

01:10:51.915 --> 01:10:53.035
I love you.

01:10:58.354 --> 01:10:59.712
What are you waiting for?

01:10:59.714 --> 01:11:01.434
Kill her! Kill her!

01:11:43.235 --> 01:11:44.672
Eric?

01:11:44.674 --> 01:11:49.273
Eric isn't here anymore.

01:11:49.275 --> 01:11:51.235
Come to me, my darling.

01:11:55.035 --> 01:11:56.592
Come with me, come with me to
the house.

01:11:56.594 --> 01:11:57.752
I need your help.

01:11:57.754 --> 01:11:59.273
I can't leave here, I can't
leave here.

01:11:59.275 --> 01:12:01.793
It's not safe,
it's too dangerous.

01:12:01.795 --> 01:12:03.435
It's protected here.

01:12:04.314 --> 01:12:05.793
Your daughter.

01:12:05.795 --> 01:12:09.672
Your daughter's the only
one who could help you now.

01:12:09.674 --> 01:12:11.712
She has the light.

01:12:11.714 --> 01:12:12.754
Penny.

01:12:13.674 --> 01:12:15.434
My god, I have to go.

01:12:54.275 --> 01:12:56.915
I can smell the fear dripping.

01:12:58.714 --> 01:13:00.793
When I find you,

01:13:00.795 --> 01:13:04.953
I will pull the layers
of skin from your body

01:13:04.955 --> 01:13:10.555
one layer at a time before
I gouge your eyes out.

01:13:51.714 --> 01:13:52.554
Hello?

01:13:54.354 --> 01:13:55.195
Hello?

01:13:57.594 --> 01:14:02.874
Crystal, Crystal is that you?

01:14:06.235 --> 01:14:07.953
Crystal.

01:14:07.955 --> 01:14:09.073
What's going on?

01:14:09.075 --> 01:14:11.073
Are you okay? Where's Penny?

01:14:11.075 --> 01:14:12.595
Is she all right?

01:14:14.075 --> 01:14:15.392
Crystal?

01:14:15.394 --> 01:14:16.235
Help me.

01:14:18.835 --> 01:14:21.073
Oh Crys, Crys,
what's going on?

01:14:21.075 --> 01:14:23.115
You okay, where's Penny?

01:14:25.835 --> 01:14:27.833
Crystal!

01:14:27.835 --> 01:14:29.875
No, fuck!

01:14:51.115 --> 01:14:52.275
Get off me!

01:15:16.235 --> 01:15:17.075
Penny.

01:15:18.674 --> 01:15:19.514
Penny!

01:15:31.674 --> 01:15:32.514
No, Penny.

01:15:42.875 --> 01:15:43.835
Penny! Penny!

01:15:48.195 --> 01:15:49.752
You're back.

01:15:49.754 --> 01:15:52.794
What did you do
to them?

01:15:55.634 --> 01:15:57.512
They're very unwell.

01:15:57.514 --> 01:15:58.632
No.

01:15:58.634 --> 01:15:59.913
Yes.

01:15:59.915 --> 01:16:00.955
No.

01:16:02.474 --> 01:16:04.073
What did you do to Penny?!

01:16:04.075 --> 01:16:04.993
- Hayley.
- Where is she?!

01:16:04.995 --> 01:16:05.835
Hayley!

01:16:06.714 --> 01:16:08.833
Don't be like that.

01:16:08.835 --> 01:16:11.512
If you would just
for once listen.

01:16:11.514 --> 01:16:12.354
So listen.

01:16:13.594 --> 01:16:17.235
Just fucking listen!

01:16:32.235 --> 01:16:33.153
What are you gonna do with that?

01:16:33.155 --> 01:16:34.514
Don't come any closer.

01:17:02.955 --> 01:17:03.995
Please!

01:17:05.554 --> 01:17:07.113
Let me in!

01:17:07.115 --> 01:17:08.955
Let Lucifer the fuck in!

01:17:52.835 --> 01:17:53.875
Come on!

01:17:58.115 --> 01:18:00.354
Oh my god!

01:18:11.554 --> 01:18:12.913
Oh my god.

01:18:12.915 --> 01:18:13.715
Oh my god.

01:18:15.035 --> 01:18:16.434
Oh no, no, no, no.

01:18:19.354 --> 01:18:20.195
Crystal!

01:18:22.195 --> 01:18:23.035
Oh my god.

01:18:28.754 --> 01:18:30.033
Wait, you're gonna be okay.

01:18:30.035 --> 01:18:32.352
You keep looking at me, okay?

01:18:32.354 --> 01:18:34.233
It's gonna be fine, it's gonna
be fine.

01:18:34.235 --> 01:18:36.273
I'm gonna ring an ambulance,
okay?

01:18:36.275 --> 01:18:37.995
It's gonna be okay.

01:18:38.795 --> 01:18:40.035
It's not okay.

01:18:47.035 --> 01:18:47.875
It's not.

01:18:50.514 --> 01:18:51.354
Okay.

01:18:52.875 --> 01:18:54.913
The ambulance is gonna be here
soon, okay?

01:18:54.915 --> 01:18:56.432
You're gonna be fine.

01:18:56.434 --> 01:18:57.474
I'm sorry.

01:18:58.434 --> 01:19:00.674
Don't say that for once.

01:19:01.434 --> 01:19:02.275
Eric.

01:19:05.075 --> 01:19:06.314
I always knew.

01:19:09.554 --> 01:19:11.075
Hayley.

01:19:15.075 --> 01:19:16.273
I need to go.

01:19:16.275 --> 01:19:19.115
I'm gonna get the car, okay,
okay?

01:19:25.474 --> 01:19:27.594
Wait, the keys, the keys.

01:19:28.474 --> 01:19:29.314
The keys!

01:19:34.995 --> 01:19:37.235
No, no, no please. Don't, no.

01:19:39.714 --> 01:19:41.153
No!

01:19:58.594 --> 01:20:01.394
Stop it, stop!

01:20:15.035 --> 01:20:19.275
Run, run, run.

01:21:32.915 --> 01:21:35.392
I know you're in there.

01:21:35.394 --> 01:21:36.955
Come out, come out!

01:21:39.474 --> 01:21:41.195
Eric, please don't.

01:21:43.115 --> 01:21:44.275
Eric, please.

01:24:02.235 --> 01:24:03.554
Hayley, Hayley.

01:24:04.514 --> 01:24:05.554
It's me, Eric.

01:24:07.995 --> 01:24:11.432
What have I done?
What have I done?

01:24:11.434 --> 01:24:12.432
Please.

01:24:12.434 --> 01:24:13.592
Eric, Eric!

01:24:13.594 --> 01:24:15.512
Okay, okay,
we need to get you help.

01:24:15.514 --> 01:24:17.352
We need to get you help, okay?

01:24:17.354 --> 01:24:18.552
Help me.

01:24:18.554 --> 01:24:20.073
Help me, please.

01:24:20.075 --> 01:24:21.073
We need to leave.

01:24:21.075 --> 01:24:21.915
No, no!

01:24:25.474 --> 01:24:26.833
I need you!

01:24:26.835 --> 01:24:28.472
No!

01:24:32.394 --> 01:24:33.354
No, Eric!

01:24:58.955 --> 01:25:00.595
Please stop, please!

01:25:16.314 --> 01:25:17.752
Eric's gone.

01:25:17.754 --> 01:25:20.394
This time, it's Lucifer's night.

01:25:46.235 --> 01:25:47.075
Please.

01:25:48.075 --> 01:25:50.915
Just tell me where
my daughter is.

01:26:02.594 --> 01:26:03.434
Mommy?

01:26:05.115 --> 01:26:06.755
I will walk again!

01:26:10.314 --> 01:26:11.632
Penny!

01:26:11.634 --> 01:26:12.474
Penny!

01:26:23.554 --> 01:26:25.394
Baby, you're freezing.

01:26:29.714 --> 01:26:30.554
Oh god.

01:26:37.394 --> 01:26:38.592
It's too late.

01:26:38.594 --> 01:26:41.914
She's gone.

01:26:44.714 --> 01:26:47.074
Only you can save us now.

01:27:20.275 --> 01:27:22.634
Come to me, my children.

01:28:14.875 --> 01:28:15.715
No, no!

01:28:19.754 --> 01:28:21.394
Mommy, kill him.

01:28:22.915 --> 01:28:24.835
No, I can't, I can't.

01:28:27.674 --> 01:28:28.514
Please.

01:28:30.075 --> 01:28:32.314
I love you, I always have.

01:28:34.394 --> 01:28:37.193
You don't have to do this.

01:28:37.195 --> 01:28:38.035
No.

01:28:39.795 --> 01:28:41.515
Mommy, it's time.

01:28:48.835 --> 01:28:51.555
Finish this once and for all.

01:28:56.035 --> 01:28:57.675
Do it now, Hayley.

01:29:00.195 --> 01:29:01.955
It's not him anymore.

01:29:04.354 --> 01:29:08.195
Please, please, please,
don't make me do this.

01:29:09.875 --> 01:29:12.712
You've got to do this.

01:29:12.714 --> 01:29:13.554
Let me go.

01:30:02.354 --> 01:30:03.474
I love you.

01:30:06.875 --> 01:30:09.035
I love you, I love you.

01:30:11.115 --> 01:30:12.835
Eric, Eric, no, no.

01:30:37.514 --> 01:30:38.354
Eric!
