Yep.

to use the bathroom.

when I flushed that letter.

for today.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.390

seasoned with paprika,

10:41.390 --> 10:43.059
and just a smidge
of floor lint.

for lunch?

to that devil machine

10:58.491 --> 10:59.408
before things get
any worse.

11:01.118 --> 11:02.828
That's exactly what you said
the first time you heard
your phone talk.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.541
Lou, these are
merely coincidences.

11:07.541 --> 11:11.587
It was probably the gang
of possums I chased out
of the kitchen earlier.

11:11.587 --> 11:14.840
Actually, now that
I think about it,
those might not be almonds.

11:20.179 --> 11:22.431
We gotta figure out
what's going on
with Finn and that letter.

11:22.681 --> 11:25.601
Yeah. Last night,
I caught him sneaking
back into the cabin.

11:26.477 --> 11:30.439
Also, Ravi says weirder stuff
in his sleep than he does
when he's awake.

11:30.439 --> 11:31.732
I didn't think
that was possible.

11:32.525 --> 11:35.861
But, yeah, Finn's
been acting weird lately.
Even for him.

11:36.362 --> 11:38.489
And he once taped
his thumbs to his hands

11:38.781 --> 11:40.908
to see if he would make
a good dinosaur.

11:43.702 --> 11:46.622
Okay, if we're gonna
figure out what's
going on with Finn,

11:46.622 --> 11:48.624
we need to keep
our eyes on him
at al times.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.794
Great idea. We'll never
let him out of our sight.

11:55.548 --> 11:56.632
Where'd he go?

11:57.091 --> 11:59.260
Normally, we would
just follow the smell.

11:59.802 --> 12:01.512
But he took
a shower
in the sink!

12:02.138 --> 12:05.683
Dang it! Why did Finn
have to pick today
to take up personal hygiene?

12:11.021 --> 12:13.732
Zuri! You've been in there
an hour! We have to go
work on the garden.

12:14.233 --> 12:17.945
ZURI: I'm sick.
I blame Ravi's
possum almonds.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.531
Nice try.
You didn't
even eat any.

12:20.823 --> 12:23.909
Is Swimmer's Elbow
a thing? 'Cause
I think I have that.

12:25.619 --> 12:27.705
Maybe Balthazar
did this to her.

12:27.705 --> 12:29.999
No, Lou, she's just
faking to get out
of helping with the garden.

12:30.499 --> 12:33.169
It won't work!
It's worked pretty
good so far.

12:33.711 --> 12:35.296
Zuri, get out
here now!

12:35.880 --> 12:36.881
Fine!

12:37.131 --> 12:39.592
What is it that
you hate about
gardening so much?

12:40.092 --> 12:44.722
Let's see. Manual labor,
cow manure,
not getting paid.

12:44.722 --> 12:48.601
Does any of that sound
like a "Zuri's gonna love
this" situation to you?

12:49.643 --> 12:52.146
Zuri, you're an owner.
This is good
for the campers.

12:52.146 --> 12:53.355
You need to help
with the garden.

12:54.815 --> 12:57.401
Uh, guys,
where is
the garden?

12:58.319 --> 13:00.154
Balthazar strikes again!

13:00.446 --> 13:02.072
I told you
he was evil!

13:02.072 --> 13:05.910
Evil? He got rid
of vegetables
and got me out of work.

13:06.368 --> 13:07.661
Sounds like
a saint to me.

13:14.251 --> 13:15.336
Where the heck is Finn?

13:15.711 --> 13:17.796
Well, we know that he's not
behind that tree.

13:17.796 --> 13:20.132
You already jumped from behind
there hiding from a butterfly.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.719
In my defense it was really
big for a butterfly.

13:24.803 --> 13:26.430
And I'm very small
for a human.

13:27.848 --> 13:29.600
You're not that big for
a butterfly, either.

13:36.357 --> 13:39.735
Whoa. This looks like a bunch
of supplies from camp.

13:40.361 --> 13:41.445
(THUD)

13:41.820 --> 13:42.571
What's that noise?

13:43.197 --> 13:44.657
I hope it's not
that giant butterfly

13:44.657 --> 13:46.408
coming to finish me off!

13:48.369 --> 13:49.411
BOTH: Finn?

13:49.787 --> 13:51.038
Hey, guys.

13:51.997 --> 13:53.749
What are you doing out here
with all this stuff?

13:54.291 --> 13:55.793
This isn't what it looks like.

13:56.418 --> 13:57.962
It looks like you've stolen
a bunch of supplies,

13:57.962 --> 13:59.630
and built your own camp site.

14:00.422 --> 14:01.507
Oh.

14:01.507 --> 14:03.676
Well, then it's exactly
what it looks like.

14:09.765 --> 14:12.017
I can't believe
the entire garden is gone.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.102
Zuri did it.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.479
Why would I waste my time
stealing veggies?

14:15.854 --> 14:18.649
Now, if you're growing
cupcakes, I'm your girl.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.735
I know it was you.
Balthazar called it.

14:21.735 --> 14:23.737
A sister will betray a sister.

14:24.071 --> 14:25.447
Lou's right.

14:25.447 --> 14:27.825
It all make sense now.
Zuri, you hated this garden.

14:27.825 --> 14:31.495
No, I hated that you
were making me help
with this garden.

14:31.495 --> 14:33.205
A small, but
important difference.

14:33.789 --> 14:35.416
She's lying.
She can't be trusted.

14:35.416 --> 14:36.750
Help me lock her in the shed.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.087
I wouldn't advise that.

14:40.087 --> 14:43.924
Upsetting me
then giving me access to
power tools is a bad idea.

14:44.717 --> 14:45.676
Uh, guys?

14:46.969 --> 14:48.721
We have a major problem.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.806
You're darn right.
Balthazar is tearing us apart,

14:50.806 --> 14:52.975
just like Betsy and Skeeter's
relationship.

14:53.267 --> 14:54.310
And Skeeter's legs.

14:54.810 --> 14:56.729
By the time that Ferris wheel
got done with him

14:56.729 --> 14:58.689
he was too short to ride it.

14:59.690 --> 15:02.943
No! A councilor
just told me that
Destiny, Finn, and Matteo

15:02.943 --> 15:04.695
disappeared from
soccer practice.

15:04.695 --> 15:05.905
They cannot find them
anywhere.

15:06.238 --> 15:07.781
That's it.

15:07.781 --> 15:09.742
That's the something of great
value that will go missing.

15:09.742 --> 15:10.743
The campers.

15:11.035 --> 15:13.203
Well, certainly
Destiny and Matteo.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.540
We are victims of
Balthazar's black magic.

15:16.999 --> 15:18.334
I'll get my seance kit.

15:18.792 --> 15:20.294
Or we could go look for him.

15:20.294 --> 15:22.296
Less fun, but okay.

15:25.716 --> 15:28.886
Finn, we are not
leaving until you tell us
what's going on.

15:29.136 --> 15:31.013
Great! Grab a tent,
and if you're hungry,

15:31.013 --> 15:32.806
there's some Otter Nuggets
in that box.

15:33.057 --> 15:34.808
I'll never be that hungry.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.687
Is all of this about
that letter
you got from home?

15:39.730 --> 15:40.773
Yeah.

15:41.315 --> 15:42.316
What did it say?

15:42.650 --> 15:43.776
It doesn't matter.

15:44.318 --> 15:46.487
We're just trying to help you.

15:46.487 --> 15:48.572
But we can't if you
don't let us.

15:50.115 --> 15:51.116
Okay.

15:52.993 --> 15:55.871
The letter said that
my family is gonna move
at the end of this summer.

15:56.372 --> 15:58.123
So I have to leave
all my friends behind.

15:59.375 --> 16:00.834
It's just so stupid.

16:02.836 --> 16:06.090
Finn, I am so sorry.

16:06.924 --> 16:07.841
Why didn't you tell us?

16:08.300 --> 16:10.844
Because talking about it
makes me wanna cry.

16:11.220 --> 16:13.639
And I didn't want you guys to
see me with my eyes raining.

16:14.932 --> 16:17.017
Hey, you can always
tell us anything.

16:17.643 --> 16:18.852
We won't judge you for it.

16:18.852 --> 16:19.853
Yeah.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.231
I only judge you for
not washing your hands

16:22.231 --> 16:23.774
after you go to the bathroom.

16:24.525 --> 16:26.402
And for using
your boogers as glue.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.030
But... Why did you
decide to make

16:30.030 --> 16:32.825
your own Camp Finn-iwaka
out here?

16:33.325 --> 16:34.868
Because I went to Balthazar,

16:34.868 --> 16:38.080
and he said to
do something outrageous
and it would fix my problem.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.916
So I did, and now I'm never
gonna have to move away.

16:40.916 --> 16:43.252
I'm gonna stay
at Camp Kikiwaka forever.

16:43.836 --> 16:46.880
So that's why you took
all these things from camp?

16:47.131 --> 16:48.924
Why didn't you tell us
your plan?

16:48.924 --> 16:51.385
Because I didn't want
you guys to talk me out of it.

16:51.927 --> 16:54.555
Well, if you had we could have
given you some advice.

16:55.639 --> 16:57.933
Like don't leave ice-cream
out in the summer.

16:58.392 --> 17:01.854
Hey, if I'm gonna be
stuck eating these
vegetables all winter,

17:02.229 --> 17:03.731
I'm gonna want some dessert.

17:04.982 --> 17:05.941
There you are.

17:05.941 --> 17:08.193
Hey, is all this stuff
from the garden?

17:08.193 --> 17:09.319
How did it get here?

17:09.737 --> 17:10.946
It was me.

17:10.946 --> 17:11.947
I took it all.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.450
But he has
a really good explanation.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.869
Oh, I know what
the explanation is.

17:16.869 --> 17:19.038
Balthazar's black magic
compelled you.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.331
Evil spirits,
be gone!

17:23.959 --> 17:25.919
He's not possessed, Lou.

17:25.919 --> 17:28.047
Yeah. Not now.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.632
Just did the whole
hand, head,
demons-be-gone thingy.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.010
Finn, why would you
bring all of this

17:33.010 --> 17:34.344
out into the middle
of the woods?

17:34.762 --> 17:35.929
It doesn't matter.

17:35.929 --> 17:37.723
I'll start taking this
stuff back to camp.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.185
What the heck has
gotten into him?

17:41.602 --> 17:42.978
It's a long story.

17:43.437 --> 17:44.855
Well, let's go talk to him.

17:44.855 --> 17:46.607
You two can fill me in
on the way back to camp.

17:50.402 --> 17:53.697
So, looks like you were wrong
about my stealing the garden.

17:53.697 --> 17:56.241
I'll take my apology
in hundreds, thank you.

17:57.242 --> 17:59.078
Zuri, I don't think I have any
more hundreds on me.

17:59.661 --> 18:01.080
Oh! Hey, another one.

18:02.247 --> 18:03.874
Apology accepted.

18:06.960 --> 18:08.170
Hey, Finn.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.965
Destiny and Matteo told me
why you took all that
stuff from camp.

18:11.965 --> 18:12.966
I get it.

18:13.675 --> 18:15.344
So you think it was
a good idea?

18:15.594 --> 18:18.430
Lordy, no. You would
have been eaten by
bears within a week.

18:20.015 --> 18:22.267
But I get why you did it.

18:22.810 --> 18:23.852
And I'm so sorry.

18:24.311 --> 18:26.146
I know how much you
love your home town.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.816
It's not just my home town.

18:28.816 --> 18:31.193
I'm leaving all my friends.
Everything.

18:31.193 --> 18:33.070
I'm totally fartbroken.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.366
Uh, you mean heartbroken?

18:38.033 --> 18:40.702
No. Ever since I found out
I was moving,

18:40.702 --> 18:42.621
my stomach just seized up.

18:42.621 --> 18:45.082
I haven't farted in two days.

18:46.542 --> 18:49.294
Maybe he should move away
from the fire.

18:51.171 --> 18:53.423
Look, I know how hard
this is for you.

18:54.091 --> 18:57.261
My mom and dad didn't even ask
me if I wanted to move, Lou.

18:57.261 --> 18:59.221
And I can't do anything
about it.

18:59.763 --> 19:01.014
It's not fair.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.100
It's okay, Finn.

19:03.684 --> 19:05.060
(SIGHS)

19:05.060 --> 19:07.771
I know that this sounds like
the end of the world to you,

19:08.188 --> 19:10.149
but I promise you it's not.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.984
Yes it is.

19:13.443 --> 19:15.988
Hey, you remember when
you first got to camp?

19:16.405 --> 19:18.574
You didn't know any
kids here, did you?

19:18.574 --> 19:19.575
No.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.785
Now you've got these two.

19:22.452 --> 19:25.706
Yeah, and we're your
best friends.

19:25.706 --> 19:27.082
And the coolest.

19:29.334 --> 19:31.336
Fine. Just best.

19:33.130 --> 19:36.091
And you're gonna make friends
in the new place too.

19:36.091 --> 19:37.176
I just know it.

19:38.093 --> 19:40.012
You guys really think so?

19:40.345 --> 19:42.598
Yup. It's what you do.

19:42.598 --> 19:43.807
(CHUCKLES)

19:43.807 --> 19:46.351
And I'll come visit you
as soon as you move in.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.145
That way it won't
seem so scary.

19:48.687 --> 19:49.730
I'll come visit, too.

19:50.731 --> 19:52.691
Maybe it won't be so bad.

19:53.066 --> 19:55.068
Who knows, it might
even be fun.

19:55.068 --> 19:58.488
A whole new town
full of stuff you
haven't broken yet.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.574
That does sound like fun.

20:00.574 --> 20:01.909
That's the spirit.

20:02.242 --> 20:04.077
Thanks, guys.
I feel better now.

20:04.077 --> 20:06.038
And I'm not fartbroken
any more!

20:06.663 --> 20:09.041
(ALL GAGGING)

20:09.917 --> 20:11.460
You don't have to tell us.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.714
Seriously, get him
away from the fire!

20:20.177 --> 20:22.012
Here we are.

20:22.012 --> 20:25.015
An assortment of fresh
vegetables without even
a trace of possum droppings.

20:26.475 --> 20:28.393
What?
Nothing. Enjoy.

20:29.102 --> 20:31.146
Wow, Ravi.
These look amazing.

20:31.146 --> 20:32.898
Are they from the new
vegetable garden?

20:33.232 --> 20:34.608
Nope. The farmers market.

20:34.942 --> 20:37.152
Turns out everything
in the garden died.

20:38.028 --> 20:41.156
I'm sorry.
I thought sustainable meant
you didn't have to water it.

20:42.157 --> 20:43.033
That's it.

20:43.617 --> 20:45.244
Does someone here owe
Lou money?

20:45.244 --> 20:46.787
No,

20:46.787 --> 20:49.331
I'm smashing Balthazar back to
the underworld he came from.

20:49.331 --> 20:52.960
(LAUGHS) Actually,
I believe he came from
the American Carnival Supply.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.253
Is that in Hades?

20:54.253 --> 20:55.379
No, Missouri.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.174
Who cares? Now out of my way,
Ravi, or you're gonna
be a foot shorter.

20:59.174 --> 21:00.634
Which honestly,
you can't afford.

21:01.176 --> 21:03.095
Lou, the machine had nothing
to do with it.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.596
We made all the predictions
come true.

21:04.888 --> 21:06.431
What about all the
missing stuff?

21:06.431 --> 21:07.975
Balthazar told
Finn to do that.

21:08.308 --> 21:09.268
No, he didn't.

21:09.768 --> 21:12.938
All Balthazar said was to do
something outrageous.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.398
And Finn misinterpreted that

21:14.398 --> 21:17.109
because he has a brain
the size of a fruit fly.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.151
Thank you.

21:19.528 --> 21:20.570
See what I mean?

21:21.613 --> 21:23.156
And Zuri
didn't betray me.

21:23.156 --> 21:24.533
I jumped to conclusions
because I was hurt

21:24.533 --> 21:26.076
she didn't want to
help me with my garden idea.

21:26.660 --> 21:27.911
I'm sorry, Zuri.

21:27.911 --> 21:29.037
I forgive you.

21:29.496 --> 21:32.082
And I would never
betray you, Emma.

21:32.582 --> 21:35.043
At least not in any way that
could be traced back to me.

21:36.211 --> 21:37.504
There. You see, Lou?

21:37.504 --> 21:39.506
We are the architects
of our own fate.

21:39.965 --> 21:43.260
Yeah. The great Balthazar
is just a carnival game.

21:44.344 --> 21:46.930
Well, maybe you guys
are right.

21:47.180 --> 21:48.557
Of course we are.

21:48.557 --> 21:51.935
And I'll prove it by getting
a fortune to show
you how silly it is.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.189
(MACHINE WHIRRING)

21:58.191 --> 22:00.736
You will never be known for
your physical strength.

22:01.611 --> 22:03.280
I'll show you!

22:03.280 --> 22:04.990
Hand me that hammer.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.283

22:06.283 --> 22:07.993

(GROANS)

22:09.453 --> 22:10.454
(GRUNTS)

22:11.997 --> 22:14.041
Well, you didn't have to be
Balthazar to see that coming.
