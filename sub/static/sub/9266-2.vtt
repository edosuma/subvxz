14:52.103 --> 14:54.645
When you're done with it,
I need the violine.

14:54.745 --> 14:56.745
Get dress up, OK.

14:56.999 --> 14:58.939
Dress up, we got a tow...

15:04.962 --> 15:07.444
- Principal Taylor
- Hey y'all.

15:09.110 --> 15:10.127
What is it going to take?

15:10.210 --> 15:10.942
I'm not sure what kind
of conversation ...

15:11.025 --> 15:12.999
we're having here,
what are you talking about?

15:13.082 --> 15:15.082
Oh I think you know.

15:15.173 --> 15:16.392
Are we talking about Luke?

15:16.492 --> 15:18.605
Yeah, we are talking about Luke,
Tami. Yeah.

15:18.705 --> 15:19.705
Huhu.

15:19.805 --> 15:21.574
So what is going to take like
new books for library...

15:21.657 --> 15:24.491
... new instruments for
the orchestra, or what?

15:24.591 --> 15:27.267
Are y'all coming to me in
the school parking lot...

15:27.367 --> 15:28.812
... and offering me a bride?

15:28.912 --> 15:31.596
You need to be reasonable, you need
to be reasonable about that Tami.

15:31.696 --> 15:33.621
It's not going to do
anything but hurt this kid.

15:33.721 --> 15:36.263
We can' let that happened to him, we
can't let that happened to our team.

15:36.363 --> 15:37.550
We can't let
that happened to the school.

15:37.633 --> 15:38.690
... can't let that happened
to you Tami.

15:38.773 --> 15:42.185
What's going to happened to
you if he's gone down?

15:42.285 --> 15:43.934
I think you're gonna get lynched.

15:44.034 --> 15:46.417
That's so sweet, you're so
sweet. To think about me, ...

15:46.517 --> 15:49.113
... I appreciate that so much. I can
take care of myself, thank you.

15:49.213 --> 15:52.343
OK but think of this, that first window
have to be forfeited because of this.

15:52.443 --> 15:54.482
If that happens we might
not make it back from that.

15:54.582 --> 15:57.909
That means we might not make to
state this year, do you want that?

15:58.009 --> 15:59.687
That boy was unrolletery illegally.

15:59.787 --> 16:03.472
Yes and ironicly he just happens
to be going to a school...

16:03.572 --> 16:07.312
... where your husband
is the football coach.

16:08.759 --> 16:11.361
Just do me a favor,
would you go home...

16:11.461 --> 16:13.847
... and ask your husband
one thing, ask him...

16:13.947 --> 16:16.327
... who put up that mail box?

16:17.092 --> 16:18.844
Because the Dillon Panthers...

16:18.944 --> 16:21.422
... has been using that mailbox
long before I got here...

16:21.522 --> 16:23.695
... and if I want to do
little digging around...

16:23.795 --> 16:26.890
... you know what I think
things could come up.

16:26.990 --> 16:28.823
I think games could be forfeited,

16:28.906 --> 16:31.776
I think rings could be lost.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.125
You got to be kidding me.

16:56.328 --> 16:59.898
Hey Tim Riggins
who used to be a Panther.

17:00.278 --> 17:01.714
Good morning.

17:01.814 --> 17:03.814
Tell me you need a tow.

17:04.636 --> 17:05.627
Yeah, no...

17:05.710 --> 17:08.992
... but I do need a ride to school which
would be awesome because my mom's...

17:09.093 --> 17:12.122
... not here, I don't know what she is
doing, she's MIA for some reason...

17:12.222 --> 17:14.185
... and I had to find my
dog this morning cause a...

17:14.269 --> 17:16.339
... little squirrel got get in
again and I miss the bus...

17:16.423 --> 17:19.854
... and my hair was doing this weird flip
thing that I wasn't really too sure about...

17:19.954 --> 17:22.123
... and that just really rough
morning all together so...

17:22.223 --> 17:25.717
... let get the showing up, come on,
let's get going we're going to be late.

17:25.817 --> 17:28.027
Don't never do this again.

17:30.774 --> 17:33.079
I mean all I did all day
was carring big, heavy,

17:33.179 --> 17:35.533
rusty, dirty peaces of
metal out of the junkyard

17:35.633 --> 17:36.895
estuff

17:36.995 --> 17:38.701
I just can't believe you were naked.

17:38.801 --> 17:41.535
No, I wasn't naked, he was naked.

17:41.618 --> 17:43.966
Whatever, and he never
even asked about my art.

17:44.066 --> 17:47.408
I mean why is he thinking I'm there, is
he thinking I like doing manual labor.

17:47.508 --> 17:50.123
Or maybe he think, you
know, you're not a great artist ...

17:50.223 --> 17:52.412
... cause you go
to community college.

17:52.495 --> 17:55.498
And no offense, I've been...
I mean...

17:55.598 --> 17:56.408
It's fine.

17:56.698 --> 17:58.799
I'm just saying you
need to get him excited.

17:58.899 --> 18:02.254
You need to show him who
you are and your art and...

18:02.354 --> 18:04.662
... just take the bull by the horns.

18:04.762 --> 18:07.295
Hey you know I've been
told that I have pluck.

18:07.395 --> 18:09.452
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:10.645 --> 18:12.770
You know what that means?

18:51.400 --> 18:53.356
Euh Ma'am.

18:53.439 --> 18:56.329
I'm Coach Taylor from high school.

18:56.434 --> 18:58.695
Are you Vince's mother by chance?

18:58.795 --> 19:00.795
Yeah why?

19:01.222 --> 19:04.622
I just want to...
I just want to talk...

19:06.311 --> 19:09.834
I just came by to talk to you he
ain't in a practice in few days...

19:09.934 --> 19:11.164
No, that's his business.

19:11.264 --> 19:15.344
It... it ain't no laws
about missing no practice.

19:16.955 --> 19:18.855
Mah'am.

19:19.766 --> 19:22.571
I'm just trying to help your son.

19:26.289 --> 19:28.289
You got 20 box?

19:33.229 --> 19:35.129
Please.

19:47.859 --> 19:50.300
Lincoln and Victory...

19:51.205 --> 19:53.205
... almost every night.

20:00.236 --> 20:03.381
Hey do you know how
to get to Lobic.

20:04.954 --> 20:07.844
You got to take 6 to one up to 23.

20:09.174 --> 20:11.794
Hey, Dillon East, right?

20:12.630 --> 20:14.916
You're the coach at Dillon East.

20:15.016 --> 20:17.481
You've lost your inner paria.

20:18.575 --> 20:21.602
You know sword, have you
ever heard swing your sword?

20:21.702 --> 20:23.998
You're supposed to swing
your sword like this.

20:24.098 --> 20:26.903
You're swinging your's like this.

20:27.379 --> 20:29.867
I mean you got to
find your inner paria.

20:29.967 --> 20:33.098
A lot of time, thing is
happened for a reason.

20:33.198 --> 20:35.553
We don't know why God
wants it that way...

20:35.653 --> 20:40.658
... but you can't make the best out of
it... until you get back your inner paria.

20:41.125 --> 20:45.970
You might be the luckiest man
alive and not even know it.

21:10.819 --> 21:12.045
Hey babe.

21:12.145 --> 21:13.445
Hey.

21:15.013 --> 21:15.990
It smells good...

21:16.073 --> 21:16.896
- Babe
- Yep...

21:16.979 --> 21:18.979
- Babe
- Yeah.

21:19.155 --> 21:20.655
What?

21:20.779 --> 21:23.295
Did you know that that mail box...

21:23.395 --> 21:25.617
... was out there in front of
the field, that empty field.

21:25.717 --> 21:27.717
Did you know that?

21:29.323 --> 21:30.831
What are you talking about?

21:30.931 --> 21:34.785
I'm talking about Joe McCoy told
me today that that mailbox...

21:34.885 --> 21:38.675
... has been out there since you
were head coach at the Panthers.

21:38.775 --> 21:40.775
Did you know?

21:42.389 --> 21:44.515
Listen, I don't follow...

21:44.995 --> 21:48.666
... what the boosters and the parents
in town do, that's not my job.

21:48.766 --> 21:50.649
You know there are a lot
of different ways that...

21:50.732 --> 21:52.477
... people try to get
kids on the team.

21:52.763 --> 21:54.995
- Hum hum
- What does that mean?

21:55.095 --> 21:57.267
That means you sure were
paying a lot of attention...

21:57.367 --> 22:00.404
... last couple of days when you were
trying to get Luke Cafreti on the team.

22:00.504 --> 22:02.584
And you know now I am on
a really bad position...

22:02.684 --> 22:04.667
... because Joe McCoy is
about to go out and do...

22:04.767 --> 22:06.818
... all kind of researching
and all kind of digging...

22:06.901 --> 22:10.950
- ... and the things like state title...
- which they don't have.

22:11.050 --> 22:13.433
Well Honey, I'm talking
about your state title.

22:13.533 --> 22:16.083
And not just you but the team.

22:16.214 --> 22:18.908
Well you know what honey I
may not even have a team

22:19.008 --> 22:21.348
- Of course you have a team
- No I might not have a team.

22:21.448 --> 22:24.017
I'm surprised your friend Joe
didn't inform you that ...

22:24.100 --> 22:27.195
... my team hasn't showing up for
practice since the forfeit.

22:27.295 --> 22:29.384
I didn't know that,
I'm sorry to hear that.

22:29.484 --> 22:31.551
I'm glad you're sorry,
I'm sorry too.

22:31.651 --> 22:32.607
Why don't you tell me?

22:32.690 --> 22:34.649
Well I tried to get
Landry to get together...

22:34.749 --> 22:36.649
... bring the team up, but
you know what Landry did.

22:36.732 --> 22:39.156
In the middle of the
cafetaria, Landry looks at me...

22:39.239 --> 22:42.476
... and basically says:'Hey Coach,
go to hell'.

22:42.576 --> 22:45.891
Babe I'm sorry to hear
that but I still...

22:45.991 --> 22:47.530
... don't think you
should have lie to me.

22:47.613 --> 22:50.344
- I didn't lie to you
- Well I wish you had told me that you...

22:50.444 --> 22:52.419
Well you should have told
me that you knew that.

22:52.519 --> 22:53.519
Knew what?

22:53.619 --> 22:55.254
I don't know who put
the mailbox there.

22:55.337 --> 22:57.750
You're saying I put the mailbox there
cause everyone else say I did...

22:57.833 --> 22:59.509
... cause I didn't I don't
know who put it there.

22:59.592 --> 23:00.307
Dont raise you voice.

23:00.390 --> 23:02.046
I'm not raising my voice
I don't want to come in...

23:02.129 --> 23:05.283
... my own house to be accused
first thing I sit down.

23:05.383 --> 23:07.488
- Then don't lie to me next time
- I didn' lie to you

23:07.588 --> 23:11.753
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to get some milk.

23:32.921 --> 23:34.921
What the hell man.

23:35.891 --> 23:37.415
Vince.

23:37.975 --> 23:40.270
You can throw the gym home.

23:41.688 --> 23:43.036
Vince, let me talk to you.

23:43.136 --> 23:45.190
- Can't you see we're hooping there
- Yeah I can see...

23:45.273 --> 23:46.905
- Talk to him in school
- I can see, I understand.

23:46.988 --> 23:51.268
He's not in school, is he ?
You're making a mistake, man.

23:51.368 --> 23:53.540
Hey, Officer Shokee come.

23:53.849 --> 23:56.642

24:06.612 --> 24:08.612
Would you talk to me?

24:09.114 --> 24:10.833
Hey Vince,

24:10.933 --> 24:13.477
You're gonna throw it away?
Last chance.

24:13.577 --> 24:16.637
I'm not gonna waste my time anymore.

Don't mean to interrupt, I just... can
I just have a quick word with you, Joe?

28:50.575 --> 28:52.700
Don't talk much yourself.

28:53.661 --> 28:56.924
I just want to make sure we
don't have any misunderstanding.

28:57.024 --> 29:00.339

conversation in the school parking lot.

29:00.439 --> 29:02.632
You know with the... XXX
car and all that stuff.

29:02.732 --> 29:04.735
And I just wanted to
make sure I was clear.

29:04.835 --> 29:08.108
That my decision has been
made and is made and...

29:08.191 --> 29:13.127
... that Luke Cafreti is
going to East Dillon High.

29:13.560 --> 29:15.449
Are you clear about what I told you?

29:15.549 --> 29:17.081
Oh yeah, I think I heard you...

29:17.181 --> 29:19.581

investigation and ratio...

29:19.681 --> 29:21.836

29:21.936 --> 29:23.408

29:25.964 --> 29:28.120

gentlemen here about that...

29:28.203 --> 29:30.333
