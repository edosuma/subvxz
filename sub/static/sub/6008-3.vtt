00:46.088 --> 00:48.798
There you are, Mr Bates.
It's in. Came this morning.

00:48.882 --> 00:52.009
They said it would,
which isn't quite the same thing.

(DOOR BELL JINGLING)

00:54.638 --> 00:55.847
Hello.

00:56.348 --> 00:58.641
I could have posted that for you.

00:58.726 --> 01:01.102
Well, I prefer to do it myself.

01:01.937 --> 01:03.688
I'll wait outside.

01:08.736 --> 01:10.027
Lovely.

01:18.412 --> 01:19.454
(GASPS)

01:19.538 --> 01:21.330
What are you doing?

01:23.208 --> 01:25.460
Lfyou must know,
I'm trying to find some space

01:25.544 --> 01:28.546
on top ofthe cupboard to make life easier.

01:29.047 --> 01:31.090
(SIGHS) So, what's in it, then?

01:31.967 --> 01:33.050
What?

01:33.135 --> 01:36.763
The bleeding great packing case
that weighs a tonne, that's what.

01:36.847 --> 01:40.141
- Can't you just leave it?
- No, I can't.

01:40.225 --> 01:42.518
And you'll tell me right now.

01:46.857 --> 01:49.734
- Anything interesting?
- Not particularly.

01:50.986 --> 01:52.945
It's from Evelyn Napier.

01:53.030 --> 01:56.282
You met him with the Delderfields
last November, at Doncaster races.

01:56.366 --> 01:58.868
- Is that Lord Branksome's boy?
- It is.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.620
Do you like him?

02:01.246 --> 02:04.123
- I don't dislike him.
- And what's he writing about?

02:04.208 --> 02:07.668
Nothing much, he's out with
the York and Ainsty next week.

02:07.753 --> 02:10.755
The meet is at Downton.
He'll want some tea when he's up here.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.381
Where's he staying? With friends?

02:13.217 --> 02:16.052
He says he's found a pub
that caters for hunting.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.804
Well, we can improve on that.

02:17.888 --> 02:21.390
He must come here.
He can send the horses up early if he wants.

02:21.475 --> 02:23.518
He'll know why you're asking him.

02:23.602 --> 02:24.811
I can't think what you mean.

02:24.895 --> 02:27.522
His mother's a friend of mine.
She'll be pleased at the idea.

02:28.190 --> 02:31.192
Not very pleased, she's dead.

02:33.278 --> 02:34.695
All the more reason, then.

02:34.780 --> 02:38.199
You can write a note, too,
and put it in with mine.

02:40.369 --> 02:43.788
Should I tell him about your friendship
with his late mother?

02:43.872 --> 02:46.249
I am sure you, of all people,
can compose a letter

02:46.333 --> 02:49.210
to a young man without any help from me.

02:50.128 --> 02:54.882
- How much did it cost?
- Every penny I'd saved. Almost.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.969
And is this the mystery lover?

03:00.305 --> 03:04.350
I've been taking a correspondence course
in typing and shorthand.

03:04.434 --> 03:06.853
That's what was in the envelopes.

03:06.937 --> 03:09.355
- Are you any good?
- Yes.

03:10.357 --> 03:12.441
I am, actually.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.569
(DOOR OPENING)

03:15.737 --> 03:19.156
Her ladyship wants the fawn skirt
Lady Mary never wears.

03:19.241 --> 03:22.618
The seamstress is going to fit it to
Lady Sybil, but I can't find it.

03:22.703 --> 03:23.744
I'll come in a minute.

03:24.663 --> 03:27.540
- They're waiting now.
- One minute.

03:27.624 --> 03:30.209
I'm just changing my cap and apron.

03:37.342 --> 03:40.678
Have you told anyone?
What did your parents say?

03:40.762 --> 03:42.972
I can't tell them till I've got ajob.

03:43.056 --> 03:47.810
Dad will think I'm a fool to leave a good place
and Mum will say I'm getting above myself,

03:48.645 --> 03:51.898
- but I don't believe that.
- Nor do I.

03:53.483 --> 03:57.320
It's not of my doing.
It's all Mary's own work.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.071
But I think we should encourage it.

03:59.156 --> 04:01.991
Branksome's a dull dog,
but I don't suppose that matters.

04:02.117 --> 04:04.827
- Did you know his wife had died?
- He only ever talks about racing.

04:04.953 --> 04:06.495
Cora is right.

04:07.664 --> 04:12.585
Mary won't take Matthew Crawley,
so we'd better get her settled

04:12.669 --> 04:15.087
before the bloom is quite gone offthe rose.

04:15.172 --> 04:16.339
Is the family an old one?

04:17.799 --> 04:19.508
Older than yours, I imagine.

04:19.843 --> 04:22.345
- Old enough.
- And there's plenty of money.

04:22.471 --> 04:23.679
- Oh, really?
- Hmm.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.932
Mama, you've already looked him up
in the stud books

04:26.016 --> 04:29.352
and made enquiries about the fortune,
don't pretend otherwise.

04:29.478 --> 04:32.605
(SCOFFS) Are you afraid someone will think
you're American ifyou speak openly?

04:32.689 --> 04:34.357
I doubt it'll come to that.

04:34.983 --> 04:37.026
- Shall I ring for tea?
- No, not for me.

04:37.110 --> 04:40.529
I'm meeting Cripps at five.
I'll see you at dinner.

04:42.157 --> 04:43.699
You don't seem very pleased.

04:44.868 --> 04:46.327
I'm pleased.

04:46.995 --> 04:50.039
- It's not brilliant, but I'm pleased.
- So?

04:50.165 --> 04:53.376
I don't want Robert to use a marriage

04:53.460 --> 04:57.046
as an excuse to stop fighting
for Mary's inheritance.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.048
It won't make any difference.

04:59.341 --> 05:03.302
I don't think he has the slightest intention
offighting as it is.

05:03.387 --> 05:07.306
The price ofsaving Downton is to accept
Matthew Crawley as his heir.

05:07.391 --> 05:09.016
What about you?

05:09.726 --> 05:11.727
I don't dislike Matthew.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.313
In fact, I rather admire him.

05:14.856 --> 05:17.316
Is that sufficient reason
to give him your money?

05:17.401 --> 05:20.528
- Ofcourse not.
- Then there's nothing more to be said.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.739

- I'd offer you a lift if I could.
- It was you I was coming to see.

Well, then, your timing is matchless.

The other day, at dinner,

05:41.091 --> 05:44.260
Cousin Isobel was saying you wanted
to see some ofthe local churches.

05:44.386 --> 05:46.178
She's right. I do.

05:46.263 --> 05:49.849
I want to know more about the county
generally, if I'm to live here.

05:49.933 --> 05:54.353
Well, I thought I might show you
a few ofthe nearer ones.

05:54.438 --> 05:56.981
We could take a picnic
and make an outing of it.

05:57.107 --> 06:00.609
- That's very kind.
- Nonsense. I'll enjoy it.

06:00.736 --> 06:04.113
It's too long since I've played the tourist.

06:04.239 --> 06:05.531
Well, it would have to be a Saturday.

06:05.615 --> 06:07.992
The churches work on Sunday
and I work all the weekdays.

06:08.118 --> 06:09.702
Then Saturday it is.

06:09.786 --> 06:14.206

and I'll pick you up at about 11:00.

- Well, it's easy.

06:22.632 --> 06:26.260
You just press the letters
and they print on the paper.

06:28.138 --> 06:29.847
Get back, please.

06:32.517 --> 06:34.643
They were trying to hide it,
so I knew it was wrong.

Where's Gwen now?

06:37.522 --> 06:40.357
Doing the dining room with Anna,
they'll be finishing.

06:40.484 --> 06:41.984
Then I'll wait.

06:42.110 --> 06:45.905
With all due respect, Mr Carson,
Gwen is under my jurisdiction.

06:45.989 --> 06:50.493
Indeed she is, Mrs Hughes, and I have
no intention of usurping your authority.

06:50.619 --> 06:52.787
I merely want to get to the bottom of it.

06:52.871 --> 06:54.705

ifshe wants one?

- What's that doing here?
- Ah, Gwen. Come in.

07:00.045 --> 07:03.089
Why is that down here?
Who's been in my room? They had no right.

- and that gives me every right.
- This is you, isn't it?

07:15.143 --> 07:18.270
All we want is to know
what Gwen wants with a typewriter

07:18.355 --> 07:20.606
and why she feels the need
to keep it secret?

07:20.690 --> 07:23.651
She wants to keep it private, not secret.

07:23.735 --> 07:25.152
- There's a difference.
- Amen.

07:25.237 --> 07:27.530
I've done nothing to be ashamed of.

07:27.656 --> 07:31.450
I've bought a typewriter
and I've taken a postal course in shorthand.

07:31.535 --> 07:34.120
I'm not aware that either
ofthese actions is illegal.

07:34.204 --> 07:37.957
Will you tell us why,
preferably without any more cheek?

07:41.711 --> 07:46.423
Because I want to leave service.
I want to be a secretary.

07:50.053 --> 07:51.762
You want to leave service?

07:51.888 --> 07:55.099
- What's wrong with being in service?
- Nothing's wrong with it.

07:55.225 --> 07:58.519
And there's nothing wrong
with mending roads, neither,

07:58.603 --> 08:00.479

that there are plenty ofyoung girls

08:03.316 --> 08:05.359

08:05.443 --> 08:07.444
And when I hand in my notice
I shall be happy

08:07.571 --> 08:09.238
to think one ofthem will be taking my place.

What makes you think we'll wait till then?

08:11.658 --> 08:14.243
Are you hiring and sacking now,
Miss O'Brien?

08:14.327 --> 08:16.620

with Mr Carson and Mrs Hughes.

Enough ofthis.
I'm going to ring the dressing gong

08:19.166 --> 08:21.959

08:22.794 --> 08:25.045
Can I have my machine back now?

Very well, but I wish I were sure
you know what you're doing.

08:32.095 --> 08:35.764

not a trip up the Nile.

- I can't decide.

08:42.856 --> 08:45.524
Kirby, possibly, or perhaps Easingwold.

- You don't think you're being a bit obvious?
- Coming from you, that's rich.

- Oh. Did he accept?
- Not yet.

- Perhaps he thought it was too obvious.
- Apparently, he's bringing a friend with him.

An attache at the Turkish embassy.
A Mr Kemal Pamuk.

09:09.466 --> 09:13.344
He's the son ofone ofthe sultan's ministers
and he's here for the Albanian talks.

09:13.678 --> 09:17.598
- What's that?
- To create an independent Albania.

09:17.682 --> 09:20.935
- Don't you read the papers?
- I'm too busy living a life.

09:21.019 --> 09:23.896
Since Turkey's signature is vital,
Mr Napier's been given the job

09:23.980 --> 09:26.440
of keeping him happy
until the conference begins.

as tight as you can stand,

28:35.464 --> 28:36.714
Oh?

28:37.466 --> 28:41.094
You believe I'm much more of a rebel
than I am.

28:41.178 --> 28:42.804
Now, please go.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.683
I am not what you think I am.

28:47.810 --> 28:52.021
If it's my mistake,
if I've led you on I'm sorry, but I'm not.

28:52.147 --> 28:54.982
You are just what I think you are.

28:56.193 --> 28:58.986
No. I have never done anything.

28:59.822 --> 29:03.157
Ofcourse not.
One look at you would tell me that.

29:08.497 --> 29:10.164
Oh, my darling.

29:11.500 --> 29:13.000
Won't it hurt?

29:13.836 --> 29:14.919
Is it safe?

29:15.921 --> 29:17.255
Trust me.

29:30.769 --> 29:31.894
(MUFFLED GASP)

29:48.203 --> 29:51.080
(WHISPERS) He's dead. I think he's dead.

29:52.749 --> 29:54.750
No, I'm sure he's dead.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.045
But how?

29:58.755 --> 30:02.467
We were together and... he's dead.

30:03.469 --> 30:04.552
In your room?

30:11.268 --> 30:13.019
We've got to get him back to his own bed.

30:13.103 --> 30:16.731
But how? It's in the bachelor's corridor,
miles from my room.

30:16.815 --> 30:18.649
Well, could we manage him between us?

30:18.734 --> 30:21.527
He weighs a tonne.
I can hardly shift him at all.

30:21.612 --> 30:24.030
We need at least one other.
What about Bates?

30:24.823 --> 30:26.699
He couldn't lift him.

30:27.534 --> 30:29.619
William can't keep a secret.

30:29.703 --> 30:31.621
And Thomas wouldn't try to.

30:31.705 --> 30:33.289
We've got to do something.

30:33.373 --> 30:36.375
Then who else has as much to lose as you
if it ever gets out?

30:37.503 --> 30:38.836
Not Papa.

30:38.921 --> 30:41.589
Please don't say Papa.
I couldn't bear the way he'd look at me.

30:41.673 --> 30:44.383
No. Not his lordship.

30:53.727 --> 30:55.978
- (WHISPERING) What happened to him?
- (SHAKILY) I don't know.

30:56.063 --> 30:59.065
Heart attack, I suppose or a stroke or...

30:59.149 --> 31:02.568
He was alive and suddenly he cried out
and then he was dead.

31:02.653 --> 31:04.904
But why was he here at all?

31:05.989 --> 31:08.241
Did he force himselfon you?

31:12.829 --> 31:16.040
Well, we can talk about that later.

31:17.125 --> 31:20.211
Now, we must decide what to do for the best.

31:22.506 --> 31:23.839
There's only one thing we can do.

31:25.300 --> 31:28.052
I couldn't. It's not possible.

31:28.428 --> 31:32.223
Lfyou don't, we will figure
in a scandal ofsuch magnitude

31:32.307 --> 31:35.434
it would never be forgotten
until long after we're both dead.

31:35.519 --> 31:37.353
I'll be ruined, Mama.

31:37.437 --> 31:41.232
Ruined and notorious, a laughingstock,
a social pariah.

31:41.316 --> 31:43.693
Is that what you want
for your eldest daughter?

31:43.777 --> 31:46.153
Is it what you want for the family?

31:49.449 --> 31:50.950
We must cover him up.

31:54.121 --> 31:56.414
CORA: (WHISPERING)
Hurry, the servants will be up soon.

31:56.498 --> 31:57.582
ANNA: We've got time.

31:58.584 --> 31:59.834
(EXCLAIMS)

31:59.918 --> 32:01.419
- Mama.
- Sorry.

32:13.348 --> 32:14.849
(MARY GRUNTS)

32:39.958 --> 32:42.084
I can't make his eyes stay shut.

32:42.169 --> 32:44.253
Leave that and come away.

32:44.588 --> 32:46.881
(CRYING) He was so beautiful.

32:49.468 --> 32:50.551
Your ladyship's right.

32:52.179 --> 32:54.513
We must get back to our rooms.

32:59.686 --> 33:03.898
I feel now that I can never forgive
what you have put me through this night.

33:03.982 --> 33:06.400
I hope in time
I will come to be more merciful.

33:07.444 --> 33:09.111
But I doubt it.

33:09.321 --> 33:10.946
You won't tell Papa?

33:11.031 --> 33:15.409
Since it would probably kill him,
and certainly ruin his life, I will not.

33:15.494 --> 33:17.953
But I keep the secret
for his sake, not for yours.

33:19.039 --> 33:20.414
Yes, Mama.

33:21.333 --> 33:22.500
Anna.

33:24.169 --> 33:28.964
I will not insult you by asking that
you also conceal Lady Mary's shame.

33:31.259 --> 33:33.260
Let us go.

33:41.895 --> 33:42.937
(DOOR CLOSING)

34:09.423 --> 34:11.298
I imagine you've heard what's happened?

34:13.051 --> 34:14.135
Yes.

34:14.219 --> 34:16.595
Terrible thing. Awful.

34:18.140 --> 34:20.224
Ghastly for your parents.

34:20.767 --> 34:22.727
I don't suppose I shall ever
make it up to them.

34:23.770 --> 34:25.521
Well, it wasn't you fault.

34:25.605 --> 34:27.356
Well, I brought him here.

34:28.483 --> 34:31.026
If it isn't my fault, whose is it?

34:35.365 --> 34:38.159
I was wondering ifyou might
show me the gardens before I go?

34:38.952 --> 34:41.245
We could get some fresh air.

34:41.329 --> 34:43.664
I won't, ifyou'll forgive me.

34:44.666 --> 34:47.001
I ought to stay and help Mama.

34:48.962 --> 34:50.337
Ofcourse.

34:53.759 --> 34:55.426
I am so sorry about all this.

34:57.304 --> 34:58.846
I've told your father
I'll deal with the embassy.

34:58.930 --> 35:00.222
There won't be any more annoyance for you.

35:01.641 --> 35:03.017
Thank you.

35:05.687 --> 35:07.313
Actually, he was a terribly nice fellow.

35:08.732 --> 35:10.858
I wish you could have known him better.

35:10.942 --> 35:15.863
I took him on as a duty, but I liked him
more and more the longer I knew him.

35:19.576 --> 35:21.660
Perhaps you saw his qualities for yourself.

35:25.707 --> 35:27.416
(MARY CRYING)

35:28.543 --> 35:31.253
Which obviously, you did.

35:34.049 --> 35:35.424
I had an uncle who went like that.

35:35.509 --> 35:38.969
Finished his cocoa, closed his book,
and fell back dead on the pillow.

35:39.054 --> 35:42.848
I don't think Mr Pamuk
bothered with cocoa much, or books.

35:42.933 --> 35:44.391
He had other interests.

35:44.476 --> 35:47.394
I meant you can go just like that,
with no reason.

35:47.479 --> 35:49.897
That's why you should treat every day
as if it were your last.

35:49.981 --> 35:52.817
Well, we couldn't criticise Mr Pamuk
where that's concerned.

35:53.318 --> 35:54.401
What do you mean?

35:55.278 --> 35:57.446
Nothing. Careful with that.

36:01.326 --> 36:03.077
(MAIDS CHATTERING)

36:04.037 --> 36:05.496
Gwen, are you busy?

36:05.580 --> 36:07.122
Your ladyship.

36:10.460 --> 36:13.337
I saw this. It came out yesterday. Look.

36:13.797 --> 36:17.049
It's for a secretary.
It's a new firm in Thirsk. See?

36:18.009 --> 36:20.469
Well, I don't understand.
How did you know?

36:20.637 --> 36:22.888
That you wanted to leave?
Carson told my father.

36:23.807 --> 36:24.890
And you don't my mind?

36:24.975 --> 36:28.686
Why should I? I think it's terrific
that people make their own lives,

36:28.770 --> 36:29.937
especially women.

36:31.106 --> 36:33.232
Write to them today
and name me as your reference.

36:33.608 --> 36:37.278
I can give it without ever specifying
precisely what your work here has been.

36:39.781 --> 36:41.156
My lady...

36:42.993 --> 36:44.034
Thank you.

36:52.127 --> 36:53.669
Lady Grantham!

36:54.838 --> 36:56.380
I've come to say goodbye.

36:56.464 --> 36:59.174
They're bringing the car around
to take me to the station.

36:59.843 --> 37:01.969
Have you said goodbye to Mary?

37:02.053 --> 37:03.304
I have.

37:05.181 --> 37:07.474
Will we be seeing you here again?

37:07.559 --> 37:08.934
Nothing would give me more pleasure,

37:09.019 --> 37:12.354
but I'm afraid I am a little busy
at the moment and...

37:12.439 --> 37:13.647
(SIGHS)

37:15.567 --> 37:20.946
I wonder if I might risk embarrassing you?
Because I should like to make myselfclear.

37:21.489 --> 37:24.658
The truth is, Lady Grantham,
I am not a vain man.

37:24.743 --> 37:28.162
I do not consider myself
a very interesting person.

37:28.997 --> 37:33.250
But I feel it's important that
my future wife should think me so.

37:33.335 --> 37:35.294
A woman who finds me boring
could never love me

37:35.378 --> 37:38.881
and I believe
marriage should be based on love.

37:38.965 --> 37:41.508
(CHUCKLES) At least at the start.

37:45.138 --> 37:47.014
Thank you for your faith in me, Mr Napier.

37:47.098 --> 37:49.391
Your instincts do you credit.

37:50.977 --> 37:52.686
Good luck to you.

37:53.939 --> 37:55.648
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

37:55.732 --> 37:57.608
Did Mr Napier get off all right?

37:57.692 --> 37:58.776
He did, my lord.

37:59.319 --> 38:01.528
And poor Mr Pamuk has been taken care of?

38:02.072 --> 38:05.783
We got Grassbys, from Thirsk, in the end.

38:05.867 --> 38:09.870
They're very good and they didn't mind
coming out on a Sunday.

38:10.372 --> 38:12.122
Is everyone all right downstairs?

38:12.624 --> 38:14.124
Well, you know.

38:14.209 --> 38:17.044
He was a handsome stranger
from foreign parts one minute

38:17.128 --> 38:19.546
and the next, he was as dead as a doornail.

38:19.631 --> 38:20.839
It's bound to be a shock.

38:20.924 --> 38:24.969
Ofcourse, upstairs or down.
It's been horrid for the ladies.

38:25.053 --> 38:27.638
And for the female staff, I expect?

38:27.722 --> 38:30.474
(SIGHS) It's particularly hard
on the younger maids.

38:30.809 --> 38:31.934
Indeed.

38:32.394 --> 38:35.562
Don't let the footman be too coarse
in front ofthem.

38:35.647 --> 38:37.606
Thomas likes to show off.

38:37.691 --> 38:40.275
We must have a care
for feminine sensibilities.

38:40.360 --> 38:43.070
They are finer and more fragile than our own.

38:51.871 --> 38:53.539
(BATES GRUNTING)

38:55.083 --> 38:56.458
Mr Bates?

38:58.461 --> 39:02.256
I am going to have to insist that you tell me
what is the matter.

39:02.340 --> 39:03.966
I thought it was for Mr Carson
to give me orders.

39:04.926 --> 39:08.137
Mr Carson's no better than any other man
when it comes to illness.

39:08.221 --> 39:10.264
Now, tell me what it is
and I'll see what I can do.

39:10.348 --> 39:11.724
It's nothing, truly.

39:13.351 --> 39:15.394
I twisted my bad leg
and walked on it too soon,

39:15.478 --> 39:16.645
it'll be fine in a day or two.

39:17.397 --> 39:20.149
Well, if it isn't, I'm sending for the doctor.

39:26.239 --> 39:27.406
CARSON: The Dowager Countess.

39:27.490 --> 39:29.491
Oh, my dears.

39:30.243 --> 39:34.371
Is it really true? I can't believe it.

39:34.456 --> 39:37.041
Last night he looked so well.

39:37.959 --> 39:41.420
Course, would happen to a foreigner.
It's typical.

39:41.504 --> 39:43.005
Don't be ridiculous.

39:43.882 --> 39:45.174
I'm not being ridiculous.

39:45.258 --> 39:49.928
No Englishman would dream ofdying
in someone else's house,

39:50.013 --> 39:52.139
especially someone they didn't even know.

39:52.223 --> 39:55.350
Oh, Granny. Even the English
aren't in control ofeverything.

39:55.435 --> 39:58.562
Well, I hope we're in control ofsomething,
ifonly ourselves.

39:58.646 --> 40:01.398
But we're not! Don't you see that?

40:01.483 --> 40:03.108
We're not in control of anything at all!

40:05.737 --> 40:06.904
Edith,

40:06.988 --> 40:10.991
go and tell Mary to come back at once
and apologise to her grandmother.

40:11.076 --> 40:13.410
COUNTESS: No, leave her alone.

40:13.495 --> 40:17.206
She's had a shock. We all have.
Just let her rest.

(DOOR OPENING)

40:18.833 --> 40:21.460
Oh! Just the ticket.

40:21.544 --> 40:26.632
Nanny always said
sweet tea was the thing for frayed nerves.

40:26.716 --> 40:29.843
Though why it has to be sweet,
I couldn't tell you.

40:30.887 --> 40:35.557
What did you mean, Mr Pamuk
lived each day as if it were his last?

40:35.642 --> 40:37.935
- What I said.
- Well, how did you know?

40:39.270 --> 40:42.147
Can't keep William waiting. Gangway.

40:42.232 --> 40:46.944
I'll be asking the same question later,
so you'd better have an answer ready.

40:48.613 --> 40:52.241
Daisy, where have you hidden the flour?
I can't see it anywhere.

40:52.325 --> 40:54.618
It's just there, Mrs Patmore.

40:55.078 --> 40:58.872
Well, fetch it to me, then.
Oh, you're all in a daze today.

41:03.753 --> 41:07.923
Do you think we should have gone up there,
to see how they are?

41:08.716 --> 41:12.177
I sent a note, but I thought
I'd be in the way. Why?

41:12.887 --> 41:16.056
I thought Mary was rather struck with him
last night, didn't you?

41:16.141 --> 41:19.017
Well, it must have been frightful
for all ofthem.

41:19.102 --> 41:20.727
But there it is.

41:20.812 --> 41:23.564
In the midst of life, we are in death.

41:27.902 --> 41:30.279
I suppose Mr Napier
will have to manage everything.

41:30.363 --> 41:32.114
I suppose he will.

41:32.824 --> 41:34.700
We all thought him a very nice gentleman.

41:34.784 --> 41:36.451
Yes, he is nice.

41:37.912 --> 41:40.330
Will we be seeing a lot of him?

41:41.499 --> 41:43.500
I don't expect so, no.

41:43.585 --> 41:47.754
Because we rather hoped Lady Mary
might have taken a shine to him.

41:48.006 --> 41:49.381
Seems not.

41:50.675 --> 41:51.842
Oh, well.

41:52.719 --> 41:56.388
There are plenty more fish in the sea
than ever came out of it.

42:11.905 --> 42:14.281
Are you looking for something?

42:14.365 --> 42:15.782
Lady Mary?

42:17.785 --> 42:21.955
I just wanted to make sure the room
had been tidied up after the...

42:22.081 --> 42:24.208
After the people had left.

42:27.712 --> 42:29.630
Life can be terribly unfair, can't it?

42:31.049 --> 42:32.758
It certainly can.

42:33.551 --> 42:37.888
Everything seems so golden one minute,
then turns to ashes the next.

42:39.307 --> 42:41.808
Can I ask you a question, Carson?

42:42.560 --> 42:46.813
Have you ever felt your life
was somehow slipping away

42:47.982 --> 42:50.567
and there was nothing
you could do to stop it?

42:50.652 --> 42:54.071
I think everyone feels that
at one time or another.

42:55.156 --> 42:57.241
The odd thing is I feel,

42:58.660 --> 43:00.786
for the first time, really,

43:01.746 --> 43:04.331
I understand what it is to be happy.

43:06.251 --> 43:08.335
It's just I know that I won't be.

43:08.836 --> 43:11.922
Oh, don't say that, my lady.

43:13.174 --> 43:16.260
Don't raise the white flag quite yet.

43:16.344 --> 43:19.263
You'll still be mistress of Downton.

43:19.347 --> 43:22.683
Old lady Grantham hasn't given up
the fight, not by a long chalk.

43:22.767 --> 43:24.184
Oh, that...

43:24.936 --> 43:27.020
I wasn't even thinking about that.

43:27.981 --> 43:32.276
And if I may say so, my lady,
you're still very young.

43:33.152 --> 43:36.196
Am I? I don't feel it.

43:38.324 --> 43:39.449
We're all behind you, my lady.

43:40.535 --> 43:43.704
The staff. We're all on your side.

43:45.623 --> 43:47.207
Thank you, Carson.

43:49.377 --> 43:53.171
You've always been so kind to me. Always.

43:54.215 --> 43:56.967
From when I was quite a little girl.

43:57.051 --> 43:58.510
Why is that?

43:59.470 --> 44:01.847
Even a butler has his favourites, my lady.

44:02.974 --> 44:04.182
Does he?

44:05.059 --> 44:06.643
I'm glad.

44:06.728 --> 44:08.395
ANNA: Lady Mary.

44:11.232 --> 44:12.566
Oh, my lady, I thought...

44:12.692 --> 44:14.067
Carson and I were just making sure

44:14.193 --> 44:17.070
that everything was ship-shape
and Bristol fashion.

44:17.196 --> 44:18.572
And it is.

44:25.246 --> 44:26.413
Good night, Carson.

44:27.248 --> 44:28.915
Good night, my lady.

44:38.176 --> 44:41.094
Of all the men on earth.
I mean, he looked so fit.

44:41.179 --> 44:44.765
Dr Clarkson said it was a heart attack.
Did you see any signs?

44:44.849 --> 44:47.601
Didn't have much of a chance
to study the gentleman.

44:48.394 --> 44:51.355
You don't suppose there's anything
sinister in it, do you?

44:51.439 --> 44:53.857
Every day the papers warn us
of German spies

44:53.941 --> 44:57.444
and they did say his presence was essential
for peace in Albania.

44:57.570 --> 44:59.029
I doubt it, my lord.

44:59.113 --> 45:02.199
Anyone wanting to poison his food
would have to get pass Mrs Patmore.

45:02.283 --> 45:04.201
(CHUCKLES) Blimey, that's a thought.

45:04.952 --> 45:06.787
Unless, ofcourse, she's a spy herself.

45:06.871 --> 45:08.622
(EXCLAIMS IN PAIN)

45:10.958 --> 45:15.629
I wish you'd tell me what's wrong, Bates.
You'll be in no trouble. I only want to help.

45:15.755 --> 45:16.880
I know that, your lordship.

45:16.964 --> 45:20.300
And I am grateful, truly,
but there is nothing I need help with.

45:26.140 --> 45:28.809
- Good morning, Mrs Hughes.
- Good morning, my lord.

45:28.935 --> 45:30.644
I wonder ifyou...

(INHALES)

45:40.655 --> 45:41.988
(MRS HUGHES SIGHS)

45:42.073 --> 45:46.243
Now will you kindly explain
what in heaven is going on?

45:46.327 --> 45:47.994
I'm perfectly well, Mrs Hughes.

45:48.079 --> 45:50.080
Bit stiff, that's all.

45:53.167 --> 45:57.087
Just so long as you know,
I'm not leaving until you tell me.

46:06.764 --> 46:08.014
(SIGHS)

46:11.185 --> 46:13.687
I hope you have a strong stomach.

46:27.535 --> 46:29.536
Oh, my god!

46:38.004 --> 46:39.379
Cousin Mary?

46:40.882 --> 46:42.340
Hello.

46:42.884 --> 46:43.884
Are we expecting you?

46:44.469 --> 46:48.722
No, but I wanted to see you.
I looked for you yesterday at church.

46:49.891 --> 46:52.142
I wasn't feeling up to it.

46:52.226 --> 46:53.894
None of us were.

46:54.979 --> 46:57.564
Must have been a horrible shock.

46:57.648 --> 46:58.815
Yes.

46:59.567 --> 47:00.650
And he seemed a nice fellow.

47:02.570 --> 47:03.904
He was.

47:04.989 --> 47:06.740
A very nice fellow.

47:08.201 --> 47:12.329
So, ifthere's anything I can do, please ask.

47:14.665 --> 47:16.082
There isn't.

47:17.168 --> 47:18.543
But thank you.

47:30.097 --> 47:33.183
(SIGHS) Well, here goes.

47:34.560 --> 47:38.063
Do you not think
we ought to say a few words?

47:38.940 --> 47:40.941
What? Good riddance?

47:41.067 --> 47:43.360
That and your promise.

47:45.738 --> 47:47.280
Very well.

47:47.365 --> 47:50.450
I promise I will never again try to cure myself.

47:52.119 --> 47:54.704
I will spend my life happily
as the butt ofothers' jokes

47:54.789 --> 47:56.122
and I will never mind them.

47:56.249 --> 47:59.793
We all carry scars, Mr Bates, inside or out.

48:00.461 --> 48:03.421
You're no different to the rest of us,
remember that.

48:03.506 --> 48:05.090
I will try to.

48:05.675 --> 48:07.467
That I do promise.

48:13.349 --> 48:15.475
MRS HUGHES: Good riddance!

48:18.020 --> 48:21.773
- So he definitely went in?
- I saw him walk through the door.

48:21.857 --> 48:23.858
But you don't know if he went back
to his own room?

48:24.610 --> 48:27.028
Yes, I do, 'cause I was the one
who found him there the next day.

48:27.154 --> 48:31.199
What I mean is, you don't know
if he went back under his own steam.

48:31.325 --> 48:33.994
I suppose not,
but how else would he have done it?

48:34.120 --> 48:36.871
That's what they call the big question.

48:40.334 --> 48:43.086
I don't want to get in any trouble over this.

48:43.170 --> 48:45.130
Don't worry, you won't.

48:46.173 --> 48:48.466
Your secret's safe with me.
