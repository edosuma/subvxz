00:10.000 --> 00:22.000
You're Watching 123Movies.to

02:37.857 --> 02:39.916
You gonna get up today, Hannah?

02:41.861 --> 02:43.658
What's this?

02:43.696 --> 02:44.993
That's orange juice, Hannah.

02:45.031 --> 02:48.159
Don't ya know
I'm allergic to orange juice?

02:48.201 --> 02:49.828
Is that on your chart?

02:49.869 --> 02:53.168
How the hell should I know?
It should be.

02:53.206 --> 02:55.333
You're sure you're allergic
to orange juice?

02:56.542 --> 02:59.272
Well, better safe than sorry
I always say.

02:59.312 --> 03:02.509
Let's getcha
a little milk instead.

03:02.548 --> 03:04.106
We go through this
every other week,

03:04.150 --> 03:05.708
it's always news to her.

03:06.886 --> 03:08.751
Wouldn't you like
to get dressed today

03:08.788 --> 03:10.688
and eat with the others?

03:10.723 --> 03:12.850
I wanna see Rachel.

03:12.892 --> 03:15.190
Hannah, Rachel's very sick.

03:15.228 --> 03:17.196
I know she's sick, goddammit.

03:17.230 --> 03:19.357
Only her family can see her.

03:19.398 --> 03:20.365
I'm family!

03:20.399 --> 03:23.857
Don't get yourself all ruffled.
I'll have to give you something.

03:23.903 --> 03:25.928
You know your blood pressure.

03:28.241 --> 03:30.869
You tell Marge
I wanna see her mother.

03:30.910 --> 03:32.400
All right, I'll tell her.

03:32.445 --> 03:34.345
But I told her
day before yesterday

03:34.380 --> 03:35.870
and she said no;

03:35.915 --> 03:37.678
it would just upset you both.

03:38.417 --> 03:40.885
Rachel's gonna die alone!

03:40.920 --> 03:44.219
Her daughter comes
to see her every day.

03:44.257 --> 03:46.282
But Rachel needs to see me.

03:47.426 --> 03:50.224
She must be an old friend,
isn't she?

03:50.263 --> 03:52.493
Friend doesn't even say it.

03:56.602 --> 04:00.834
Please...
You could dress and powder me...

04:00.873 --> 04:03.171
I'll go sit with those
basket cases down the hall

04:03.209 --> 04:05.234
if you'll just let me see her.

04:05.278 --> 04:08.441
You let the
nurse's aide dress you.

04:08.481 --> 04:11.678
You have a good lunch,
then we'll see.

04:26.632 --> 04:28.930
It'd mean a lot
to both of us.

04:28.968 --> 04:32.597
Well, that's what we want.
That's what we're here for.

04:50.489 --> 04:53.686
<i>Can you imagine?
Doing that for a living?</i>

04:53.726 --> 04:56.354
<i>She'll end up in here herself
when she's 80.</i>

04:57.897 --> 05:01.856
<i>At least this room's got
a view and a window that opens.</i>

05:03.803 --> 05:07.830
<i>The freight train goes by
at two every morning...</i>

05:07.873 --> 05:09.568
<i>I listen for it.</i>

05:10.943 --> 05:13.912
<i>I'd kill myself if all
I could see was parking lot.</i>

05:16.849 --> 05:18.908
<i>I wonder if you can
hear the train?</i>

05:31.697 --> 05:34.165
You guys are getting
real good at this.

05:40.373 --> 05:42.102
Good morning, Hannah!

05:42.141 --> 05:44.666
Oh, you have got
some mail this morning!

05:44.710 --> 05:47.577
Oh, I know I saw something
in here somewhere...

05:47.613 --> 05:51.344
Oh, there it is!
It's a postcard from Alaska.

05:51.384 --> 05:54.148
Oh, look at the size
of that fish.

05:54.186 --> 05:58.179
It's a... it's a...

05:58.224 --> 05:59.020
Halibut.

05:59.058 --> 06:03.017
Oh, it's a halibut.
Look! 356 pounds!

06:03.062 --> 06:05.428
How would you even
catch something like that, huh?

06:05.464 --> 06:06.897
How would you like
to go swimmin'

06:06.932 --> 06:08.991
and see something like that
in the water with you, huh?

06:09.034 --> 06:10.433
No thanks.

06:10.469 --> 06:12.801
So would you like me
to read it to you, hon?

06:12.838 --> 06:15.363
I'll just read it to you
like I usually do, okay.

06:15.808 --> 06:21.678
It says, "Hey, Hannah.
The mud got another one.

06:21.714 --> 06:25.150
Love and regards,
Nettie Bobo."

06:25.184 --> 06:26.708
What on earth does that mean?

06:26.752 --> 06:28.947
Do you have any idea
what that means, huh?

06:30.256 --> 06:32.156
Well, I'm sorry, honey
I have just got to go.

06:32.191 --> 06:34.421
But I'll see you tomorrow.
That's some fish.

06:34.460 --> 06:38.021
My hubby would sell his soul
to hook into a fish like that.

06:38.063 --> 06:41.362
Alaska. How do you know
someone in Alaska?

06:48.274 --> 06:50.469
<i>It's people like that
drive me nuts.</i>

06:50.509 --> 06:54.468
<i>Trap us like rats
and then talk us to death.</i>

06:54.513 --> 06:58.244
<i>I can't just walk away
like I used to.</i>

06:58.284 --> 07:02.311
<i>I didn't like somethin',
off I'd go.</i>

07:02.354 --> 07:04.584
<i>That's how I ended up
in Alaska.</i>

07:04.623 --> 07:08.457
<i>No roads. Everybody flew.</i>

07:08.494 --> 07:12.624
<i>I flew over that tundra
like it was my backyard.</i>

07:13.966 --> 07:18.130
<i>Nettie's still there...
82, canoes to work.</i>

07:18.170 --> 07:20.798
<i>Digs tourists
out of the mud flats.</i>

07:20.840 --> 07:25.038
<i>They sink down in that ooze
and stick like cement.</i>

07:26.812 --> 07:30.908
<i>I loved it there...</i>

07:30.950 --> 07:33.578
<i>but I had to come back.</i>

07:33.619 --> 07:37.749
<i>I always had to come back...
For Rachel.</i>

07:37.790 --> 07:40.725
<i>She'd never leave Michigan.
Had the kids.</i>

07:40.759 --> 07:44.217
<i>Peaches to can
and pies to bake.</i>

07:47.766 --> 07:50.735
<i>She looked like someone
dipped her in flour.</i>

07:54.507 --> 07:56.475
<i>She looked like Mt. McKinley.</i>

07:57.676 --> 08:00.577
I like that -
being compared to a mountain.

08:00.613 --> 08:02.581
It was a compliment.

08:03.516 --> 08:05.177
You were gone
so long that time

08:05.217 --> 08:06.980
I thought you were
never coming back.

08:07.019 --> 08:08.145
You got married.

08:08.187 --> 08:09.950
To escape my father's temper,
not you.

08:11.524 --> 08:13.151
I had to get out.

08:13.192 --> 08:14.989
And girls are
supposed to marry.

08:15.027 --> 08:17.495
Well, at least I married
the dullest man I could find.

08:17.530 --> 08:20.090
Yeah, well, he was
a good provider,

08:20.132 --> 08:22.191
but you'd have been trapped
for the rest of your life.

08:22.234 --> 08:24.361
If Mr. Johnson hadn't
had the misfortune

08:24.403 --> 08:26.371
of dying on that excursion boat.

08:26.405 --> 08:32.503
Everyone ran to the side to wave
goodbye and the boat capsized.

08:32.544 --> 08:34.842
Never marry a weak swimmer.

08:36.815 --> 08:40.751
You waited months to write,
till after the twins were born.

08:42.020 --> 08:43.885
You tried to mourn him,

08:43.923 --> 08:47.586
but it was always me
you wanted to cook for.

08:47.626 --> 08:48.684
Don't be smug.

08:50.062 --> 08:51.427
You always thought we were

08:51.463 --> 08:53.328
the only girls
who did what we did.

08:54.066 --> 08:56.694
Whenever and wherever we could.

09:13.752 --> 09:15.276
Of course after it was over,

09:15.321 --> 09:18.256
you'd ask me to leave
and you'd go back to your Bible.

09:19.625 --> 09:22.059
Never seemed to be on my side.

09:22.861 --> 09:24.260
Neither was your family.

09:24.296 --> 09:26.093
They still aren't.

09:26.265 --> 09:28.961
Your daughter
sits with you for hours

09:29.001 --> 09:30.969
but she won't let me see you.

09:31.537 --> 09:35.303
Has the nerve to tell me
it's for my own good.

09:38.944 --> 09:43.404
I'd like to look at you
just once and die.

09:44.650 --> 09:46.345
Be a nice way to go.

09:48.287 --> 09:50.255
Isn't this a switch.

09:52.124 --> 09:55.093
For once you're staying in one
place and I'm the one leaving.

09:58.130 --> 10:00.928
I had to go.
I had to see things.

10:00.966 --> 10:04.766
Oh, Alaska,
New Mexico, Paris.

10:04.803 --> 10:06.668
My Lord, even Ohio.

10:06.705 --> 10:08.229
Now why Ohio?

10:08.273 --> 10:09.604
It's Michigan, only flat.

10:09.642 --> 10:12.270
Some of Ohio is very pretty.
You've just never seen it.

10:15.314 --> 10:18.181
Every once in a while
you just had to leave me.

10:18.217 --> 10:21.550
You knew I'd be wild for you
when you finally got back.

10:25.491 --> 10:27.459
I've been everywhere...

10:28.661 --> 10:30.424
Even South America.

10:31.997 --> 10:35.125
That's where I found
the seeds for your moonflowers.

10:36.168 --> 10:37.430
Mr. Johnson...

10:37.469 --> 10:39.403
used to walk around with
his eyes down on the ground,

10:39.438 --> 10:41.065
like he was
looking for lost change.

10:41.940 --> 10:44.670
He wouldn't know
a moonflower from a lilac bush.

10:51.817 --> 10:54.547
What do wives find to
talk about with their husbands?

10:55.487 --> 10:57.921
Mr. Johnson and I
ran out of conversation

10:57.956 --> 11:00.117
in less than two years.

11:01.026 --> 11:02.823
You and I never did.

11:03.696 --> 11:07.325
Nope.

11:07.366 --> 11:09.163
Sometimes we'd sit
in the yard

11:09.201 --> 11:11.795
and watch your
moonflowers come out;

11:11.837 --> 11:14.863
they'd unfold in seconds,

11:14.907 --> 11:17.239
just bloomin' in the night.

11:18.711 --> 11:23.273
Then later in the night
I'd call you my moonflower...

11:23.315 --> 11:26.284
when I was pressed up
under your nightgown.

11:31.657 --> 11:34.319
And by morning
the moonflowers had shriveled

11:34.359 --> 11:37.055
and you had
your hairnet back on.

11:37.096 --> 11:38.688
How was I supposed
to cook breakfast

11:38.731 --> 11:40.062
without my hairnet?

11:41.633 --> 11:44.864
You have the most
beautiful hair.

11:44.903 --> 11:46.427
Oh, Hannah.

11:46.472 --> 11:48.269
Don't start something
we can't finish.

11:51.744 --> 11:53.371
Hello, Hannah!

11:54.079 --> 11:57.480
Jesus, Marge, I can hear!

11:57.516 --> 11:59.848
I just can't walk
or see worth a shit.

12:00.586 --> 12:03.350
The nurse says you've been
wanting to see Mom.

12:03.388 --> 12:04.878
Of course I have.

12:04.923 --> 12:07.221
We can't have you
upsetting her.

12:07.259 --> 12:08.351
Upset?! Wh...

12:08.393 --> 12:10.554
When did I ever
upset your mother?

12:10.596 --> 12:12.564
All her life.

12:12.598 --> 12:16.967
Well, if that's the case,
it was her choice.

12:19.772 --> 12:23.538
Marge, please let me see her.

12:23.575 --> 12:24.974
We need to see each other.

12:25.010 --> 12:27.478
This is no way for us
to end our lives -

12:27.513 --> 12:29.242
in two separate rooms.

12:29.281 --> 12:31.078
She has her family.

12:31.116 --> 12:32.242
I'm her family!

12:32.284 --> 12:34.912
Please. Don't.

12:34.953 --> 12:36.580
I used to tuck you in!

12:38.590 --> 12:39.887
I told you stories.

12:39.925 --> 12:42.655
I sat with you
when there were storms.

12:44.062 --> 12:46.530
You never knew your father,
but you knew me.

12:47.800 --> 12:49.597
You knew I'd always
look after you.

12:49.635 --> 12:51.296
When you weren't busy...

12:51.336 --> 12:54.430
Going to Alaska or New Mexico.

12:54.473 --> 12:57.340
I sent you postcards.
I sent you presents.

12:57.376 --> 12:58.775
I sent your mother money.

12:58.811 --> 13:00.608
Don't act like
you were there for Mom.

13:00.646 --> 13:02.477
You weren't. We were!

13:02.514 --> 13:04.311
Roy and I were there!

13:04.817 --> 13:07.786
Dammit, you were children.
You had to be there!

13:08.987 --> 13:13.754
Hannah, I grew up
a long time ago.

13:13.792 --> 13:17.922
I lost my Barbara, my daughter,
in a car accident.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.396
I have grown grandchildren.

13:19.431 --> 13:22.992
I cook, I clean, I can peaches.
I recycle my newspapers.

13:23.035 --> 13:24.935
And once a year we drive
to the Mackinac Bridge

13:24.970 --> 13:26.938
and I have a little piece
of fudge by the water.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.530
And then we drive home.

13:29.107 --> 13:30.472
And I mow the lawn.

13:31.844 --> 13:34.540
But when Mom needs me,
I come.

13:35.881 --> 13:37.940
You always came
when you darn well pleased.

13:39.518 --> 13:41.179
You don't know
anything about it.

13:43.689 --> 13:45.987
I will tell Mom
you asked after her.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.224
She was a cute little girl,

13:56.268 --> 13:57.633
but she's been
a pain in the ass

13:57.669 --> 13:59.864
ever since she joined
the Baptist Church.

14:00.873 --> 14:02.101
Hi.

14:03.041 --> 14:04.668
Are you Grandma Hannah?

14:04.710 --> 14:06.177
What?!

14:06.211 --> 14:07.371
The nurse told me

14:07.412 --> 14:08.845
I should speak with
'Grandma Hannah'

14:08.881 --> 14:10.678
about my project for school.

14:10.716 --> 14:11.978
Grandma Hannah?

14:12.017 --> 14:14.178
Jesus Christ,
don't call me that.

14:14.219 --> 14:19.521
Sorry, she must have... uh...

14:19.558 --> 14:21.025
What?

14:22.027 --> 14:24.894
Women's Suffrage?
The Civil War?

14:24.930 --> 14:26.727
What is it you want
my sage advice about?

14:26.765 --> 14:27.697
I'm busy.

14:27.733 --> 14:29.291
The Depression.

14:30.903 --> 14:32.700
I went to Alaska.

14:32.738 --> 14:34.638
Caught everything I ate
except chocolate.

14:34.673 --> 14:35.833
Are you writing it down?

14:36.808 --> 14:38.901
I voted for Roosevelt
because I liked Eleanor.

14:38.944 --> 14:41.037
The war broke out,
I lied about my age,

14:41.079 --> 14:42.876
I joined the WACS,
and I flew planes.

14:43.548 --> 14:46.244
I invested in computer stocks
in the 50s.

14:46.285 --> 14:48.651
That's how come
a Depression rat like me

14:48.687 --> 14:51.520
can afford this beauteous
single room in Hotel Hell.

14:51.556 --> 14:54.719
That's it. Posterity.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.387
You get asked this a lot.

14:56.428 --> 14:59.295
They send all you in here.
Perk me up.

14:59.331 --> 15:00.821
What in the hell
do you think I am -

15:00.866 --> 15:02.026
the public library?

15:02.067 --> 15:02.999
Go ask your parents

15:03.035 --> 15:05.060
what it was like
getting raised in the 60s.

15:05.103 --> 15:06.730
My parents are dead.

15:06.772 --> 15:08.501
Well, so are mine.

15:11.109 --> 15:15.045
Please, take me home!

15:15.080 --> 15:18.447
Please, take me home!

15:19.318 --> 15:24.278
Mama! Mama! Mama!

15:25.290 --> 15:27.622
What an awful place.

15:27.659 --> 15:29.524
Always have a gun handy
to shoot yourself

15:29.561 --> 15:31.620
in case you fall off
a goddamned roof.

15:32.965 --> 15:34.592
In Alaska if I'd fell off a roof

15:34.633 --> 15:36.726
a bear woulda ate me
and made some use out of me.

15:37.469 --> 15:38.936
Sit down.

15:40.973 --> 15:42.941
You've been to Alaska?

15:42.975 --> 15:44.442
I lived in Alaska.

15:45.677 --> 15:47.167
Look at this...

15:47.212 --> 15:49.442
From a friend of mine
who's still livin' up there.

15:49.481 --> 15:51.278
Lord, now you're
robbing the cradle.

15:51.316 --> 15:53.284
And I thought I'd seen it all.

15:53.318 --> 15:54.285
Nonsense.

15:54.319 --> 15:56.617
Living in Alaska's nonsense?

15:56.655 --> 16:01.957
Nah, I'm just mumbling to myself.
Old people do that.

16:01.994 --> 16:06.795
No, Alaska was great.
I was real happy living there.

16:06.832 --> 16:08.959
How'd you survive?

16:09.001 --> 16:12.493
Had a high school diploma.
Taught school in Barrow.

16:12.537 --> 16:15.131
Skinned things.
You get by.

16:15.173 --> 16:19.803
You just went and did it?
Most people dream and stay home.

16:19.845 --> 16:23.144
There is nothing wrong
with staying home.

16:23.181 --> 16:24.671
I'd really like
to go to Africa,

16:24.716 --> 16:26.980
but I'm afraid
if I need a blood transfusion...

16:27.019 --> 16:28.316
Why? You sick?

16:28.353 --> 16:29.320
No.

16:29.354 --> 16:30.480
So don't get sick.

16:30.522 --> 16:33.082
The blood supply in Africa
is so tainted with AIDS.

16:33.125 --> 16:34.490
What if something did happen?

16:34.526 --> 16:36.551
God forbid
something should happen.

16:37.562 --> 16:40.122
Trust me, kid,
you can 'what if' yourself

16:40.165 --> 16:42.156
into a real boring life.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.327
I really don't care
to listen to this.

16:44.369 --> 16:47.304
You call this something?
I went to your wedding!

16:47.339 --> 16:48.806
What?

16:50.042 --> 16:51.634
She's being ridiculous.

16:51.676 --> 16:53.769
Uh... nothin'. Forget it.

16:53.812 --> 16:55.837
So you married?

16:55.881 --> 16:57.644
Nope.

16:58.383 --> 17:01.910
It's hard to tell.
I wonder...

17:01.953 --> 17:04.183
Girls used to wear
pinky rings and men's socks.

17:05.057 --> 17:06.183
How old are you?

17:06.223 --> 17:07.714
Twenty-one.

17:09.394 --> 17:11.589
Maybe she doesn't know,
but I sure knew by then.

17:13.397 --> 17:15.525
Have you ever been married?

17:15.567 --> 17:17.125
Not to a man.

17:17.536 --> 17:19.026
Oh, yeah?

17:19.070 --> 17:21.039
You gonna put that
in your paper?

17:21.073 --> 17:22.300
Maybe.

17:24.675 --> 17:26.303
Is she dead?

17:27.746 --> 17:29.373
Almost.

17:30.382 --> 17:33.351
They got her in some
other wing in this dump.

17:34.619 --> 17:37.486
They won't let me see her.

17:37.522 --> 17:40.923
She's in a coma,
they still won't let me see her.

17:42.327 --> 17:45.023
Trying to protect us
from each other.

17:47.966 --> 17:50.400
People were always doing that.

17:50.435 --> 17:52.562
Is she who you talk to?

17:54.606 --> 17:57.905
I can't go to her,
so I bring her to me.

17:57.943 --> 18:00.070
And she comes on her own.

18:00.112 --> 18:04.139
I still talk to my parents...
especially when I can't sleep.

18:06.118 --> 18:08.586
You're the only person
I've told.

18:08.620 --> 18:10.000
Well, I'm pretty damn safe.

18:10.000 --> 18:10.451
You're Watching 123Movies.to
Well, I'm pretty damn safe.

18:10.451 --> 18:10.489
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:10.489 --> 18:11.717
I won't tell.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:11.717 --> 18:12.791
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:12.791 --> 18:15.589
They died last year.
Car accident.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:15.589 --> 18:17.129
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:17.129 --> 18:19.859
Rachel's been
in a coma a while...
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:19.859 --> 18:19.898
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:19.898 --> 18:21.593
Stroke.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:21.593 --> 18:22.000
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:22.501 --> 18:24.731
I was in the hospital
all busted up

18:24.769 --> 18:27.101
or I woulda taken care of her.

18:27.139 --> 18:30.233
And now her damn daughter...

18:31.476 --> 18:33.444
That's her legal family,
you know,

18:33.478 --> 18:36.106
so, anyway, here I sit.

18:36.148 --> 18:38.616
And Rachel's right here
in this nursing home?

18:38.950 --> 18:40.144
Beats the hell out of me

18:40.185 --> 18:42.153
what they think
I'm gonna do to her.

18:42.187 --> 18:44.052
I just...

18:44.089 --> 18:46.148
I wanted to say goodbye.

18:46.191 --> 18:48.785
Her daughter's
with her all the time?

18:48.827 --> 18:50.590
Well, she goes home at night.

18:53.098 --> 18:59.037
God, I'm just so afraid
that she's gonna die alone.

18:59.070 --> 19:01.595
Late at night.

19:01.640 --> 19:05.041
That'd be her way,
slip out real quiet-like.

19:07.746 --> 19:10.647
But if it was up to her,
she'd want me there.

19:10.682 --> 19:12.309
Don't be too sure.

19:13.518 --> 19:16.646
You're so funny.
She's being funny.

19:16.688 --> 19:18.781
A nurse told me
that people can visit

19:18.823 --> 19:20.757
24 hours a day
if they want.

19:21.860 --> 19:22.827
Nobody wants to.

19:22.861 --> 19:26.160
But they can.
I mean, I could.

19:26.198 --> 19:28.758
Could come by
at three in the morning,

19:28.800 --> 19:31.633
swing by your room,
visiting you.

19:31.670 --> 19:34.662
Take you for a stroll
to Rachel's room...

19:34.706 --> 19:36.333
You mean that?

19:37.576 --> 19:39.373
Um...

19:39.411 --> 19:41.379
You'd have to help me
into my chair.

19:41.413 --> 19:43.005
Is your back strong?

19:43.048 --> 19:46.176
Don't worry about it.
I play softball and basketball.

19:46.218 --> 19:48.015
Uh huh.

19:48.053 --> 19:49.850
So it's no problem.

19:49.888 --> 19:51.219
Good.

19:51.256 --> 19:53.247
Because she could
go in a year,

19:53.291 --> 19:55.156
or she could go tonight.

19:55.193 --> 19:57.718
And I don't wanna miss her.

19:58.396 --> 19:59.954
Then let's go tonight.

19:59.998 --> 20:01.363
Three o'clock sound good?

20:01.399 --> 20:02.457
Yeah.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.866
How come you're goin'
outta your way for me, kid?

20:04.903 --> 20:06.564
I don't know.

20:06.605 --> 20:09.369
Maybe so somebody'll
help me out when I'm old.

20:09.407 --> 20:11.466
Yeah, don't count on it.

20:12.744 --> 20:14.405
You seen my horses?

20:15.580 --> 20:18.310
Nope.
Got nothin' in here but goats.

20:18.350 --> 20:20.875
You might want to check
the TV room down the hall.

20:20.919 --> 20:23.217
I'll just do that.

20:23.255 --> 20:25.189
How the hell
they got outta the barn,

20:25.223 --> 20:27.316
that's what I wanna know.

20:27.359 --> 20:28.883
This way?

20:28.927 --> 20:30.895
Turn left
at the drinking fountain.

20:33.265 --> 20:34.892
See ya around, toots.

20:37.269 --> 20:39.237
He a regular?

20:39.271 --> 20:41.102
Never seen him before.

20:42.641 --> 20:44.836
At least he's got
all his parts.

20:44.876 --> 20:47.572
It's those diabetics
with stumps for legs

20:47.612 --> 20:49.944
that depress
the hell out of me.

20:49.981 --> 20:52.245
Especially when
I knew 'em before, you know.

20:52.284 --> 20:54.252
Some of these kids
are from school.

20:56.288 --> 20:57.687
Is there anything you need?

20:57.722 --> 20:59.349
Anything I can
bring you tonight?

21:02.127 --> 21:03.594
Just Rachel.

21:04.796 --> 21:06.923
<i>Three o'clock.</i>

21:06.965 --> 21:08.592
Thanks, kiddo.

21:10.835 --> 21:12.325
That's not the first time

21:12.370 --> 21:14.634
you've waved somebody
under my nose.

21:14.673 --> 21:16.470
That missionary...

21:16.508 --> 21:19.602
followed you
all the way from Brazil.

21:19.644 --> 21:21.407
Do I have to hear
about her again?

21:21.446 --> 21:23.209
I mean it's ancient history.

21:23.248 --> 21:25.079
Clean food and American toilets

21:25.116 --> 21:27.141
is what looked good
to her, not me.

21:27.185 --> 21:29.779
Everything she ate
down there gave her the runs.

21:29.821 --> 21:32.813
Why do you have
to give every little detail?

21:32.857 --> 21:34.620
You always were one
to pull the curtains.

21:34.659 --> 21:36.422
Some things are private.

21:37.162 --> 21:39.824
You mean hidden...

21:39.864 --> 21:41.388
Pretending.

21:42.467 --> 21:45.527
Your dead husband's
photograph on the mantel

21:45.570 --> 21:48.869
and flowers on his grave
on Decoration Day.

21:48.907 --> 21:49.965
And there you were

21:50.008 --> 21:52.636
with all the good widows
at the cemetery.

21:52.677 --> 21:54.804
Then you'd come back home
and hop back in bed with me.

21:54.846 --> 21:56.473
I can't talk to you.

21:56.514 --> 21:57.640
You sure used to.

21:57.682 --> 21:58.649
I'm going back to my room.

21:58.683 --> 21:59.911
Fine.

22:09.527 --> 22:12.496
Used to be we'd make up
by doing the deed.

22:14.666 --> 22:17.464
I'd stay after you until
I had all your clothes off.

22:19.037 --> 22:20.504
<i>Don't you dare follow me.</i>

22:20.538 --> 22:22.597
Baby, I'll only be in Brazil
for a month,

22:22.640 --> 22:24.665
and the money is good.

22:25.777 --> 22:27.608
My God...

22:27.645 --> 22:30.341
A whole month
without your apple pie.

22:30.382 --> 22:32.407
A month without the smell
of your hair.

22:34.586 --> 22:36.349
A month without your eyes...

22:36.388 --> 22:37.412
Shut up.

22:42.894 --> 22:45.021
I'm still mad at you.

22:45.063 --> 22:46.223
I know.

22:48.066 --> 22:50.227
<i>I still feel it.</i>

22:50.268 --> 22:53.203
I want you
just like I always did.

22:53.238 --> 22:55.866
Not the way I am now,
plugged in like a lamp.

22:56.574 --> 22:59.168
Well, it's that
time again, Hannah.

22:59.210 --> 23:01.075
Let's put you on the toilet.

23:02.247 --> 23:03.737
But I haven't eaten anything.

23:03.782 --> 23:05.875
I don't need cleaning out
if I haven't eaten anything.

23:05.917 --> 23:07.714
You know we do it
every three days.

23:07.752 --> 23:08.719
It's on your chart.

23:08.753 --> 23:11.381
But I'm not bound up, dammit.

23:11.423 --> 23:13.721
Well, that's thanks to this.

23:13.758 --> 23:15.885
My body's gonna forget
how to shit on its own

23:15.927 --> 23:17.360
if you keep
shoving that up me.

23:17.395 --> 23:18.225
Just leave me alone.

23:18.263 --> 23:20.731
Hannah, we don't want
to have to restrain you.

23:20.765 --> 23:22.392
Just try it.

23:22.434 --> 23:24.561
Doctor knows
what's best for you.

23:24.602 --> 23:27.002
I haven't seen that
little asshole in three months.

23:27.038 --> 23:28.903
How does he know what I need?

23:28.940 --> 23:31.636
Look, I don't get paid
a fortune for doing this.

23:31.676 --> 23:34.440
I've got enough on my plate
without having to argue with you.

23:34.479 --> 23:35.411
I don't have the time.

23:35.447 --> 23:36.778
There's more to
taking care of people

23:36.815 --> 23:38.806
than reaming them out
every other day.

23:38.850 --> 23:40.477
Don't I have any rights?

24:01.806 --> 24:04.707
<i>There's endless beauty
in Alaska, Rachel,</i>

24:04.742 --> 24:07.040
<i>but some days
it's almost too much.</i>

24:09.547 --> 24:12.846
<i>I want beauty I can hold...
You.</i>

24:16.754 --> 24:19.621
<i>The bald eagles are just like
everything else here -</i>

24:19.657 --> 24:21.921
<i>bigger than you can imagine.</i>

24:21.960 --> 24:24.520
<i>And the mountains
grow like wildflowers.</i>

24:27.499 --> 24:29.763
<i>It'd be heaven on earth
if you were here.</i>

24:31.102 --> 24:34.503
<i>Rachel, what's so wrong
with wanting to see the world?</i>

24:34.539 --> 24:38.498
<i>I can't spend my life
lookin' out just one window.</i>

24:38.543 --> 24:42.309
<i>But mountains, eagles,
Broadway marquees -</i>

24:42.347 --> 24:44.645
<i>what's any of that
when I hold it up to you?</i>

24:46.684 --> 24:48.618
<i>Well, I gotta sign off.</i>

24:48.653 --> 24:52.248
<i>This is gonna cost me an arm
and a leg in postage as it is.</i>

24:52.290 --> 24:56.454
<i>I wish you'd write.
A penny postcard, something?</i>

24:57.595 --> 25:01.429
<i>Don't stay mad.
Please...</i>

25:01.466 --> 25:03.491
<i>I had to leave.</i>

25:03.535 --> 25:06.333
<i>I couldn't stay there
and see you with him.</i>

25:07.872 --> 25:10.841
<i>I love you, Rachel,
I truly do.</i>

25:10.875 --> 25:13.070
<i>And I wish you well.</i>

25:13.111 --> 25:15.545
<i>Think of me sometimes...</i>

25:15.580 --> 25:19.016
<i>Your old friend,
Hannah Free.</i>

25:26.057 --> 25:28.719
Hannah, wake up.
It's time to go see Rachel.

25:28.760 --> 25:30.352
I found her room.

25:30.395 --> 25:31.623
The coast is clear.

25:31.663 --> 25:33.096
Let me just
get your wheelchair.

25:33.131 --> 25:35.429
Uh, do you have to
go to the bathroom?

25:35.466 --> 25:37.525
I'm sorry, yes, I do.

25:37.569 --> 25:39.093
I always have to go
when I wake up.

25:39.137 --> 25:40.866
No big deal.
Do you use a bedpan?

25:40.905 --> 25:41.872
No!

25:41.906 --> 25:44.374
Don't you let her go
in that bathroom with you.

25:44.409 --> 25:45.535
Get a grip on yourself.

25:45.577 --> 25:48.205
Get a grip on me;
Let me help you up.

25:48.246 --> 25:50.714
I can't believe I'm finally
gonna get to see her.

25:50.748 --> 25:53.376
Don't wake me.
I'm sleeping soundly.

25:53.418 --> 25:54.385
We'll be quiet.

25:54.419 --> 25:55.215
What?

25:55.253 --> 25:56.220
Ghost.

25:56.254 --> 25:58.051
Don't call me a ghost.

25:58.089 --> 25:59.556
These aren't my slippers.

25:59.591 --> 26:01.218
Yeah. Bought you a new pair.

26:01.259 --> 26:02.556
What, are you adopting me?

26:02.594 --> 26:03.720
Maybe.

26:03.761 --> 26:05.228
You are hard up.

26:05.263 --> 26:06.230
Lean on me.

26:06.264 --> 26:08.391
Bring the chair.
I can do it, I can get in.

26:08.433 --> 26:10.560
You're always
so darn independent.

26:10.602 --> 26:13.070
Always so damn independent?

26:13.104 --> 26:15.129
Right here.
Lock the wheels.

26:24.282 --> 26:25.647
I appreciate this.

26:53.311 --> 26:55.779
<i>Dammit, Linda!
Dammit, Linda!</i>

27:50.702 --> 27:52.397
I'll just be here,
out of the way.

28:21.899 --> 28:25.699
God, you could run a farm
on all this fuckin' machinery.

28:27.004 --> 28:28.904
All these goddamn tubes.

28:30.675 --> 28:31.972
Poor kid.

28:38.916 --> 28:41.612
You go ahead and sleep, Rachel.

28:41.652 --> 28:43.415
I just wanna be here.

28:48.426 --> 28:50.451
We were together all our lives.

28:56.934 --> 29:00.995
Together and apart...
Right, Rach?

29:03.274 --> 29:05.139
It's just that I've
never seen her

29:05.176 --> 29:08.441
look unattractive
at all in some...

29:08.479 --> 29:10.106
in makeup.

29:10.148 --> 29:12.275
And I said, I said...

29:12.316 --> 29:13.749
Oh, bring your husband...

29:13.785 --> 29:15.150
Gimme, gimme!

29:16.454 --> 29:19.582
Hannah!
You're in the wrong room.

29:19.624 --> 29:21.421
No, I'm not.

29:21.459 --> 29:23.450
Look, Hannah,
you should be asleep.

29:23.494 --> 29:25.553
You're gonna get yourself sick.

29:25.596 --> 29:28.429
How in the world
did you get yourself in here?

29:28.466 --> 29:29.933
I drove.

29:29.967 --> 29:34.927
Hannah, you know how
her family feels.

29:34.972 --> 29:36.940
I'm her family.

29:37.809 --> 29:39.276
Let's take you
back to your room.

29:39.310 --> 29:40.868
No!

29:40.912 --> 29:43.142
What is the harm?

29:43.181 --> 29:45.479
Rachel should not
be here alone,

29:45.516 --> 29:48.610
not now,
not just before dawn.

29:50.254 --> 29:52.745
That's the soul's midnight.

29:52.790 --> 29:56.282
And that's the time
all us old folks die.

29:56.327 --> 29:58.625
Trust me,
people die all day long.

30:02.834 --> 30:04.301
Please let me stay.

30:04.335 --> 30:07.668
I'm sorry, hon, but you're
not supposed to be in here.

30:07.705 --> 30:10.469
Let's wheel you
back to your room.

30:10.508 --> 30:11.304
- No!
- Hannah...

30:11.342 --> 30:11.808
No!

30:11.843 --> 30:15.939
Hannah, you are not
the only person in this home.

30:15.980 --> 30:17.811
I've gotta get
back to the desk.

30:17.849 --> 30:19.976
- You come with me.
- Leave me alone!

30:20.017 --> 30:21.814
This is my great grandma.

30:21.853 --> 30:25.482
I brought Hannah here tonight.
I take full responsibility.

30:25.523 --> 30:27.354
I haven't seen you before.

30:27.391 --> 30:29.359
I flew in a couple days ago.

30:29.393 --> 30:30.621
Now look.

30:30.661 --> 30:33.653
This is
Grandma Rachel's best friend.

30:33.698 --> 30:35.825
Of course she should be here.

30:36.868 --> 30:39.336
It's a funny time of night
to come visiting.

30:39.370 --> 30:41.463
It gives them more privacy.

30:41.505 --> 30:43.973
Why don't you just
go on back to your desk.

30:45.877 --> 30:50.075
Well, maybe for another
15 minutes,

30:50.114 --> 30:52.514
then you take her
back to her room.

30:52.550 --> 30:55.451
I don't wanna find her
in here when I check again

30:55.486 --> 30:57.511
at... 3:45.

30:57.555 --> 31:01.252
I'll take her back at dawn.
She's not hurting anyone.

31:04.395 --> 31:08.354
Oh, all right.
I guess she's not.

31:08.399 --> 31:11.664
But if that daughter of hers
comes before Hannah's gone,

31:11.702 --> 31:13.863
I didn't see
either one of you.

31:13.905 --> 31:15.429
- Deal.
- Okay.

31:19.410 --> 31:21.310
What a load of bull.

31:23.748 --> 31:25.716
I think I'm rubbin' off on ya.

31:25.750 --> 31:27.547
I hope so.

31:27.585 --> 31:31.214
Did ya hear that, Rachel?
I get to stay.

31:52.610 --> 31:54.271
This is Marge.

31:59.784 --> 32:02.252
I want to make sure that...

32:03.287 --> 32:04.584
King me.

32:04.622 --> 32:06.055
Okay...

32:21.973 --> 32:23.941
Hannah, I'll check in
with you later, okay?

32:29.480 --> 32:33.610
That Greta...
she reminds me of somebody.

32:33.651 --> 32:35.278
I'm not lookin' at her.

32:44.996 --> 32:47.226
Even the squirrels
move slow around here.

32:49.500 --> 32:50.831
Pretty day.

33:02.146 --> 33:05.946
<i>Yes, sir, I was in the CCC.</i>

33:05.983 --> 33:09.851
We planted
rows and rows of trees.

33:09.887 --> 33:14.824
Lots of discipline...
Good preparation for WW II.

33:14.859 --> 33:17.123
And what did you do
after the war ended?

33:17.862 --> 33:19.659
Whaddya mean 'ended'?

33:20.865 --> 33:22.332
Oh.

33:22.366 --> 33:25.392
Say, aren't you Betty Grable?

33:26.704 --> 33:30.333
Greta? Why, I had no idea
you were in town.

33:30.374 --> 33:31.341
Nope.

33:31.375 --> 33:33.343
Weren't you gonna stop by?

33:33.377 --> 33:34.844
Wasn't planning to.

33:34.879 --> 33:36.346
Are you a friend of Betty's?

33:36.380 --> 33:37.347
Betty?

33:37.381 --> 33:38.643
Betty Grable.

33:39.250 --> 33:42.686
Uh, sir, I would like you
to meet Tallulah Bankhead.

33:42.720 --> 33:45.518
I'm sure that's
some kind of insult.

33:45.556 --> 33:47.854
What kind of a name
is Tallulah?

33:47.892 --> 33:49.519
What are you doing here?

33:49.560 --> 33:51.687
Same thing you are - visiting.

33:51.729 --> 33:54.027
Well, that's nice, I guess.

33:54.065 --> 33:55.589
If you won't
spend time with me,

33:55.633 --> 33:56.861
at least you're visiting Mom.

33:56.901 --> 33:58.869
I enjoyed talking with you.

34:03.240 --> 34:04.537
Have you seen my horses?

34:04.575 --> 34:05.371
No!

34:05.409 --> 34:07.877
Maybe you should
check down the hall?

34:07.912 --> 34:09.208
Much obliged.

34:10.380 --> 34:12.212
Save me a dance, eh?

34:16.087 --> 34:18.385
Well, how long are you
gonna be in town?

34:18.422 --> 34:19.889
As long as I want.

34:19.924 --> 34:21.755
Must you be so rude?

34:22.259 --> 34:24.226
Yes, I think I must.

34:24.261 --> 34:26.286
I messed up with your mom.

34:26.330 --> 34:28.092
I wish I could do it over.

34:29.433 --> 34:31.060
That's something.

34:31.936 --> 34:34.130
Please stop by
for lunch some day.

34:34.772 --> 34:36.967
I'll think about it.

34:37.007 --> 34:40.737
Maybe I'll even bring my lover.
She likes a good lunch.

34:40.777 --> 34:42.574
Oh, is this some
kind of test?

34:42.612 --> 34:44.739
It's just the truth.

34:44.782 --> 34:46.409
Why am I not surprised?

34:46.449 --> 34:48.145
Yeah, why aren't you?

34:48.886 --> 34:51.581
You just knew I was
gonna turn out bad, huh?

34:51.621 --> 34:53.283
I didn't mean...

34:53.324 --> 34:55.884
I need to, uh...
make sure they turn Mom.

34:55.926 --> 34:57.894
I don't think
they do it often enough.

34:57.928 --> 34:59.589
Marge? Grandma?

34:59.630 --> 35:00.892
Yes?

35:01.799 --> 35:03.528
Make sure you're
not doing it again...

35:03.567 --> 35:06.536
screwing things up between
Great Grandma and Hannah.

35:07.304 --> 35:09.431
I don't know what you mean.

35:09.473 --> 35:11.134
I'll bet you don't.

35:11.742 --> 35:14.609
It's sad, it's really sad.

35:14.645 --> 35:16.704
It's not the same thing.

35:16.747 --> 35:18.806
It's not
the same thing at all!

36:09.033 --> 36:11.331
<i>Can you believe Katie
got in trouble again?</i>

36:11.368 --> 36:13.836
I'm not that surprised.
She gets in trouble a lot.

36:20.211 --> 36:21.701
We better not.

36:22.213 --> 36:23.510
There.

36:23.547 --> 36:24.844
Don't do that.

36:24.882 --> 36:26.349
Don't wipe away my kisses.

36:26.383 --> 36:27.941
You want me to
go get Dewey Russell?

36:27.985 --> 36:28.849
You wanna kiss him?

36:28.886 --> 36:30.854
I don't want to kiss anybody.

36:30.888 --> 36:32.515
So it's not just me?

36:32.556 --> 36:35.024
Especially not you, Hannah.

36:35.059 --> 36:36.026
Rachel!

36:36.060 --> 36:37.755
If you don't
feel funny about this,

36:37.795 --> 36:39.353
why are we
in this chicken coop?

36:39.396 --> 36:40.693
I'm shy.

36:41.732 --> 36:43.529
Don't laugh at me.

36:43.567 --> 36:45.432
I wasn't laughing at you.

36:45.469 --> 36:47.266
It's just
you make me nervous...

36:47.304 --> 36:49.864
like you're gonna
kiss me again.

36:49.907 --> 36:51.374
Do ya want me to?

36:51.408 --> 36:52.534
No...

36:53.911 --> 36:55.378
Yes.

36:57.248 --> 36:58.715
Oh, my.

36:58.749 --> 37:00.376
You liked it?

37:00.417 --> 37:02.044
Why aren't you a boy?

37:02.086 --> 37:04.714
Do you really want me
to be a boy?

37:04.755 --> 37:06.552
No...

37:06.590 --> 37:08.217
You kiss me this time.

37:08.259 --> 37:10.000
I have to go.
I have chores to do.

37:10.000 --> 37:10.227
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!
I have to go.
I have chores to do.

37:10.227 --> 37:10.261
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:10.261 --> 37:11.558

Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:11.595 --> 37:13.222
We're going into town
for supplies.

37:13.222 --> 37:13.264
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:13.264 --> 37:15.232
How 'bout Sunday after church?
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:15.232 --> 37:15.266
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:15.266 --> 37:17.564
I can't do this on a Sunday!
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:17.564 --> 37:17.601
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:17.601 --> 37:19.398
Monday after school?
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:19.398 --> 37:19.436
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:19.436 --> 37:21.996
All right.
But just for one kiss.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

38:00.311 --> 38:02.802
Oops! I'm sorry.
More mail.

38:02.846 --> 38:04.507
My, you are popular.

38:04.548 --> 38:05.845
You get more mail

38:05.883 --> 38:08.283
than all the other people
in this place put together.

38:09.486 --> 38:11.113
That's pretty damn sad.

38:11.655 --> 38:13.282
Hmm... Hallmark?

38:14.491 --> 38:16.254
That's for me to know.

38:16.994 --> 38:18.825
Awww...

38:18.862 --> 38:21.023
You look very
tired today, Hannah.

38:21.065 --> 38:22.794
Couldn't you sleep last night?

38:23.567 --> 38:24.966
Now if your eyes are tired,

38:25.002 --> 38:27.129
I'd be very happy
to read that...

38:27.171 --> 38:29.036
I can still read!

38:32.176 --> 38:34.303
Well, would you like
to buy some stamps?

38:34.345 --> 38:35.972
I haven't any money up here.

38:36.013 --> 38:37.071
Yes, you do.

38:37.114 --> 38:39.674
Your little friend left $20
next to the front desk

38:39.717 --> 38:41.947
so you could buy yourself
some little extras.

38:41.985 --> 38:44.044
You want me to get you
a pop from the machine?

38:46.190 --> 38:47.555
Guess not.

38:47.591 --> 38:49.559
Well, the offer stands.

38:49.593 --> 38:51.060
I'll be back tomorrow.

38:51.095 --> 38:53.655
You are always
gettin' somethin'.

38:58.369 --> 39:01.338
I suppose there are some people
who think she means well.

39:03.874 --> 39:05.637
Wars break out
every other week

39:05.676 --> 39:07.940
'cause of some asshole
who means well.

39:27.398 --> 39:28.365
What do you think?

39:28.399 --> 39:29.661
You think anyone in here

39:29.700 --> 39:31.691
knows you're gonna
be my lady tonight?

39:31.735 --> 39:34.704
"My Lady."
Wow... Unbelievable.

39:39.743 --> 39:42.871
<i>So... who's that from?</i>

39:42.913 --> 39:43.937
Friend.

39:43.981 --> 39:45.539
New Mexico?

39:45.582 --> 39:47.880
Yes, and don't get all agitated.

39:49.453 --> 39:50.385
Look at me.

39:50.421 --> 39:53.219
One minute...

39:53.257 --> 39:54.554
thirty seconds...

39:54.591 --> 39:56.718
I'm going back to my room.

39:56.760 --> 39:58.523
No, wait, wait, wait.

39:58.562 --> 40:00.325
I'm paying... attention.

40:01.765 --> 40:03.562
Your mind's in New Mexico.

40:03.600 --> 40:05.192
She's just an old friend.

40:06.103 --> 40:08.071
I'm sure after all those years
working at Los Alamos

40:08.105 --> 40:09.766
she glows in the dark.

40:09.807 --> 40:12.241
Don't tell me how
that woman glows in the dark.

40:12.276 --> 40:15.074
When I'm gone, you'll probably
conjure her up for company.

40:15.112 --> 40:16.579
Her life is full.

40:16.613 --> 40:17.739
You like that about her.

40:17.781 --> 40:19.146
Yes.

40:19.516 --> 40:22.417
Honey, you don't
have to envy her.

40:23.720 --> 40:26.086
She was no match for you.

40:26.123 --> 40:27.750
You always said she was witty.

40:27.791 --> 40:29.349
So are you.

40:30.627 --> 40:33.095
Why doesn't she visit you?

40:33.130 --> 40:38.261
I'm sure that Jackie wants
to remember me the way I was.

40:41.004 --> 40:42.904
I guess I would, too.

40:43.574 --> 40:46.065
I don't want to
see me in her eyes.

40:48.645 --> 40:51.443
So...
Are you coming tonight?

40:51.482 --> 40:52.449
Hope so.

40:52.483 --> 40:53.950
That girl's bringing you?

40:53.984 --> 40:55.918
It's the only way
I can get there.

40:55.953 --> 40:57.784
Why is she helping you?

40:57.821 --> 41:01.621
Because I'm just so
fascinating she can't resist.

41:01.658 --> 41:02.784
Oh, speak of the devil.

41:02.826 --> 41:04.293
- Hi.
- Hey!

41:04.328 --> 41:06.523
I was here earlier,
but you were napping.

41:06.563 --> 41:07.962
I'm surprised you're out of bed.

41:07.998 --> 41:10.967
I'll have you know I've been
up here roaming the halls.

41:11.001 --> 41:13.765
Wow, kid, you really know
how to have a good time.

41:14.671 --> 41:16.298
So how are you?

41:16.340 --> 41:19.138
Tired...
And grateful.

41:19.176 --> 41:20.541
No problem.

41:20.944 --> 41:23.139
I left you a little money
at the front desk.

41:23.180 --> 41:24.374
Now you've
got them tipping you.

41:24.414 --> 41:25.540
I hope you don't mind.

41:25.582 --> 41:27.015
I just know
that you can't keep money

41:27.050 --> 41:28.915
up here in your room
or else it might get stolen,

41:28.952 --> 41:31.318
so this way you can
treat yourself to something.

41:31.355 --> 41:32.822
She is thoughtful.

41:32.856 --> 41:34.653
Well, thanks, kid.
I don't want anything.

41:34.691 --> 41:36.488
Not even a stamp?

41:36.527 --> 41:39.121
Pair of shoelaces?
A magazine?

41:39.162 --> 41:40.561
Read? Tie a shoe?

41:40.597 --> 41:42.622
God it makes me tired
just to think about it.

41:44.167 --> 41:46.965
I had so much energy,
but I squandered it.

41:48.305 --> 41:50.899
Now my body parts
are all worn out.

41:50.941 --> 41:53.000
But I'm still here.

41:53.043 --> 41:56.479
Got my hands,
my heart, my mind...

41:56.513 --> 41:59.004
I'm refining myself
down to the essentials.

41:59.716 --> 42:02.514
So we goin' on vacation
again tonight?

42:02.553 --> 42:04.350
- You willing?
- I am askin'.

42:04.388 --> 42:06.515
- Three o'clock?
- I'll be here.

42:06.557 --> 42:07.819
Thanks.

42:08.559 --> 42:09.856
It's all right.

42:09.893 --> 42:11.884
Hey...

42:11.929 --> 42:13.362
I wanna give you something.

42:14.197 --> 42:15.858
I thought of what
you might like.

42:15.899 --> 42:18.197
Just keep
your clothes on, Hannah.

42:18.235 --> 42:19.668
In there.

42:29.913 --> 42:31.676
It's my journals.

42:31.715 --> 42:33.683
You'll find the Depression
in there someplace.

42:34.751 --> 42:35.877
You mean it?

42:35.919 --> 42:37.147
You'd let me read 'em?

42:37.187 --> 42:38.552
I can quote from 'em?

42:38.589 --> 42:40.216
I thought somebody should
get some good out of 'em.

42:40.257 --> 42:43.226
I'll try to skip over
all the personal stuff.

42:43.260 --> 42:44.488
It's all right.

42:44.528 --> 42:46.655
If you can read
my handwriting, honey,

42:46.697 --> 42:48.562
you're welcome to 'em.

42:48.599 --> 42:50.794
So there you go.
Maybe you'll learn something.

42:50.834 --> 42:51.960
I bet I will.

42:52.002 --> 42:53.560
I bet she will.

42:53.604 --> 42:55.231
See you tonight.

42:55.272 --> 42:56.398
It's a date.

42:59.610 --> 43:01.578
<i>It's a date.</i>

43:02.446 --> 43:04.573
Aren't you just
the nursing home Romeo.

43:04.615 --> 43:06.173
Well, she is pretty cute.

43:07.384 --> 43:11.047
Something 'bout the way
she walks reminds me of you.

43:12.956 --> 43:15.584
You have such a great ass.

43:15.626 --> 43:17.992
Is that why you couldn't
keep your hands off of it?

43:18.028 --> 43:21.259
Near death has really
brought out your racy side.

43:21.298 --> 43:24.756
You old flirt.
You never let me read those.

43:24.801 --> 43:25.597
You're in 'em.

43:25.636 --> 43:27.433
I hope you were kind.

43:27.471 --> 43:29.132
Not always...

43:30.107 --> 43:30.937
They're not just journals.

43:30.974 --> 43:33.272
I wrote a novel
when I was snowed in.

43:33.310 --> 43:35.039
Beat alcoholism.

43:35.646 --> 43:37.341
Am I in that too?

43:38.982 --> 43:41.280
I think you'll
recognize yourself.

43:41.318 --> 43:43.286
Why'd you give them to her?

43:45.489 --> 43:48.287
I want somebody
to know I was here.

43:48.325 --> 43:49.792
Well, I know.

43:49.826 --> 43:52.351
I want somebody to know
you were here too.

43:53.764 --> 43:54.696
The real you -

43:54.731 --> 43:57.427
not the you smiling
at church bake sales.

43:58.568 --> 44:00.695
I wanted people
to know about us...

44:02.139 --> 44:05.040
who's not afraid
of what 'us' means.

44:07.711 --> 44:09.611
I want somebody to know

44:09.646 --> 44:13.343
that I took you to bed...
and I loved you.

44:14.518 --> 44:16.486
We know.

44:16.520 --> 44:18.818
Yeah, but what about posterity?

44:18.855 --> 44:20.152
Posterity?

44:20.190 --> 44:21.157
Yeah.

44:21.191 --> 44:22.852
Good Lord, what next?

44:24.361 --> 44:25.658
Well?

44:25.696 --> 44:26.663
Well what?

44:26.697 --> 44:28.324
What are you doin' in here?

44:29.032 --> 44:30.659
Isn't this my room?

44:30.701 --> 44:31.963
No!

44:32.002 --> 44:34.266
You old men
are in the basement.

44:34.304 --> 44:36.238
Go ask the nurse
to show ya.

44:36.873 --> 44:38.500
I'm lost.

44:39.710 --> 44:41.075
I know you're lost.

44:41.111 --> 44:44.740
Ask the nurse
to take you to your room.

44:45.382 --> 44:47.009
Do I know you?

44:48.051 --> 44:50.849
I wish I had a picture
of you when you were younger.

44:50.887 --> 44:52.445
What's your name?

44:54.725 --> 44:56.693
You wanna take a guess?

44:56.727 --> 44:57.853
No.

44:58.895 --> 45:00.863
Well, then tell me
who you are.

45:03.066 --> 45:04.693
How soon do ya
have to know?

45:04.735 --> 45:06.362
<i>Here you are.</i>

45:08.071 --> 45:10.369
He never knows
where his room is.

45:10.407 --> 45:12.034
Come on, let's get you
back to your room.

45:12.075 --> 45:13.440
I know you.

45:14.411 --> 45:17.209
Not anymore you don't.

45:17.247 --> 45:19.715
Your friend,
she don't talk much.

45:22.419 --> 45:23.943
You should take a nap.

45:25.088 --> 45:26.385
Your little friend will be

45:26.423 --> 45:28.220
waking you up
before you know it.

45:29.259 --> 45:31.022
I used to wake you up.

45:32.429 --> 45:35.728
I'd wake up and my nightgown
would be unbuttoned.

45:42.939 --> 45:45.237
Honey, it's light out.
I've gotta get up.

45:45.275 --> 45:47.300
It's cold outside the covers.

45:48.612 --> 45:51.911
Gotta feed the chickens,
make breakfast for the kids...

45:51.948 --> 45:53.609
I'll feed the chickens.

45:59.790 --> 46:02.088
Take your long johns off.

46:02.125 --> 46:03.683
You first.

46:11.134 --> 46:12.533
It is cold.

46:36.860 --> 46:39.420
I hope that's not in
those books you gave that girl.

46:41.832 --> 46:44.300
I wonder if she has
a little girlfriend.

46:46.236 --> 46:49.535
I'll bet you anything
that she's just like us.

46:52.843 --> 46:56.335
I never could convince you
that we weren't the only ones.

46:59.749 --> 47:01.876
You never thought
what we did was right.

47:03.019 --> 47:04.646
Don't be silly.

47:05.956 --> 47:07.617
Didn't we sit
on my front porch

47:07.657 --> 47:09.716
holding hands,
watching the sunset?

47:11.361 --> 47:14.023
Maybe not when we were 30,
but when we were 60.

47:14.064 --> 47:15.156
Well, then they just thought

47:15.198 --> 47:16.961
we were a couple
of cute old ladies.

47:18.034 --> 47:20.002
No one ever thought
you were cute.

47:21.171 --> 47:23.605
Everyone in this town
knows what you are, Hannah,

47:23.640 --> 47:26.165
so they know about me too.

47:26.209 --> 47:28.643
<i>I sat there
knowing full well</i>

47:28.678 --> 47:30.873
<i>I was hanging out
my bed sheets.</i>

47:30.914 --> 47:32.814
<i>It meant so much to you</i>

47:32.849 --> 47:35.818
<i>that I finally just
let go of my privacy.</i>

47:39.289 --> 47:43.419
<i>And let people,
family, neighbors...</i>

47:43.460 --> 47:46.429
<i>know exactly who I am.</i>

47:47.230 --> 47:48.754
Now...

47:48.798 --> 47:51.460
You show me somebody
in one of your magazines

47:51.501 --> 47:53.469
from California that does that.

47:55.639 --> 47:58.608
I stood my ground,

47:58.642 --> 48:01.076
lived my life,

48:01.111 --> 48:03.443
and I loved you...

48:05.048 --> 48:07.778
despite everything
I was brought up to believe.

48:15.258 --> 48:16.691
I'm tired.

48:20.931 --> 48:22.558
So am I.

48:25.936 --> 48:28.234
I wish we could
take a nap together.

48:28.939 --> 48:30.406
I'll be there.

48:42.452 --> 48:44.249
Quiet around without them.

48:44.287 --> 48:45.549
I'm sure they're having

48:45.588 --> 48:47.522
a great time
camping with the Wilsons,

48:47.557 --> 48:48.421
mosquitos and all.

48:48.458 --> 48:50.926
The Wilsons are
a little churchy for me.

48:50.961 --> 48:52.326
I suppose you want me

48:52.362 --> 48:54.421
to find some heathens
to take my children camping.

48:54.464 --> 48:56.091
Might be more fun.

48:56.132 --> 48:57.099
Ohhh!

49:04.975 --> 49:06.909
It's almost time
for Arthur Godfrey.

49:06.943 --> 49:08.501
You want me
to turn it on for you?

49:09.312 --> 49:11.109
He makes you fall asleep.

49:11.147 --> 49:12.774
I need my rest.

49:14.818 --> 49:16.843
Mmm... that's good.

49:34.838 --> 49:36.465
I already pulled the shades.

51:25.782 --> 51:29.081
<i>You keep after me to write you
more than three sentences.</i>

51:29.119 --> 51:30.916
<i>It took me half an hour
to find a pencil,</i>

51:30.954 --> 51:32.945
<i>but here goes.</i>

51:34.124 --> 51:35.819
<i>The ground is frozen.</i>

51:35.859 --> 51:38.054
<i>We've had snow.</i>

51:38.094 --> 51:39.789
<i>The Canada geese
are on the lake,</i>

51:39.829 --> 51:41.694
<i>taking a rest
on their way south.</i>

51:43.700 --> 51:45.167
<i>I miss you, Hannah.</i>

51:45.201 --> 51:47.669
<i>I wish you'd stay home,
but at least this time</i>

51:47.704 --> 51:49.433
<i>I know you're doing war work.</i>

51:50.073 --> 51:52.405
<i>New Mexico sounds beautiful.</i>

51:53.743 --> 51:54.903
<i>You've been having dinner</i>

51:54.944 --> 51:57.003
<i>with the same woman
all the time.</i>

51:57.046 --> 51:59.014
<i>What's that mean, 'dinner'?</i>

51:59.048 --> 52:02.540
<i>Well, I'm not knitting you
any more warm socks,</i>

52:02.585 --> 52:04.644
<i>if you're down there
'having dinner'</i>

52:04.687 --> 52:07.417
<i>while I'm up here
squirming in my sleep.</i>

52:07.457 --> 52:11.223
<i>I know people read your mail,
so I won't say any more.</i>

52:14.164 --> 52:15.893
<i>I don't know
how many more times</i>

52:15.932 --> 52:17.695
<i>I can let you leave me.</i>

52:17.734 --> 52:19.326
<i>At least I'm busy.</i>

52:19.369 --> 52:20.734
<i>I'm working
three days a week</i>

52:20.770 --> 52:22.670
<i>at the hardware store,
bookkeeping.</i>

52:22.705 --> 52:23.933
<i>The man who used to</i>

52:23.973 --> 52:25.565
<i>keep their books
is serving in Italy.</i>

52:26.743 --> 52:28.904
<i>I'm so thankful
you're not overseas.</i>

52:31.347 --> 52:33.975
<i>Be careful
in New Mexico, Hannah.</i>

52:34.017 --> 52:35.882
<i>Watch out for snakes.</i>

52:35.919 --> 52:37.716
<i>Check your boots.</i>

52:37.754 --> 52:39.221
<i>Come home soon.</i>

52:40.690 --> 52:44.148
<i>You know I love you,
but I'll say it anyway.</i>

52:45.361 --> 52:47.659
"Know ye the Lord,
He is God;

52:47.697 --> 52:49.358
it is He
that hath made us,

52:49.399 --> 52:52.493
and not we ourselves;
we are His people..."

52:52.535 --> 52:53.331
Who the hell are you?

52:53.369 --> 52:55.894
"...and the sheep
of His pasture.

52:55.939 --> 52:57.497
Enter into His gates
with Thanksgiving..."

52:57.540 --> 52:59.030
I said who the hell are you?

52:59.075 --> 53:01.839
"...and into His courts
with praise."

53:02.212 --> 53:05.181
You can't just waltz in here
and start spoutin' over me.

53:05.215 --> 53:07.683
Mary, I'm here to help you.

53:07.717 --> 53:11.517
And my name's not Mary.
Don't call me Mary.

53:11.554 --> 53:15.183
It says Mary H. Freed
on your door, Mary.

53:15.225 --> 53:17.750
Well, I don't give a
rat's ass what the door says.

53:17.794 --> 53:20.786
Profanity is not the language
of our Lord.

53:20.830 --> 53:23.424
Don't you want salvation?

53:23.466 --> 53:24.626
Don't you want to sleep

53:24.667 --> 53:26.862
in the loving arms
of Our Lord Jesus Christ?

53:26.903 --> 53:28.370
No.

53:28.404 --> 53:30.872
Now Mary, you don't mean that.

53:30.907 --> 53:35.571
My name is Hannah...
Hannah Free.

53:35.612 --> 53:40.379
No one has ever called me Mary,
not even my own mother.

53:40.416 --> 53:41.781
So why don't you just

53:41.818 --> 53:44.378
go talk to some other poor joker
who can't talk back.

53:44.420 --> 53:47.048
I can see I haven't caught you
on a very good day.

53:47.090 --> 53:49.058
I don't have good days anymore.

53:49.092 --> 53:52.528
Knowing Jesus
would lighten your burden.

53:52.562 --> 53:53.790
Believe me...

53:53.830 --> 53:57.061
"The Lord is Good;
His mercy is Everlasting."

53:57.100 --> 53:59.728
So you're on the road to Heaven?

53:59.769 --> 54:02.237
I have my mansion reserved.

54:02.272 --> 54:04.570
And I'm going to hell?

54:04.607 --> 54:08.236
If you don't accept Jesus Christ
as your personal savior.

54:12.115 --> 54:15.516
You paint a pretty
mean-spirited picture of Jesus.

54:15.551 --> 54:18.247
Don't you think
that Judgment belongs to God?

54:18.288 --> 54:21.780
Mary, you are an old woman.

54:21.824 --> 54:24.759
God may be
calling your name soon.

54:24.794 --> 54:27.422
The next time the friendly
hand of Salvation

54:27.463 --> 54:30.432
reaches out to you, Mary,
I'd grab it.

54:30.967 --> 54:33.094
My name isn't Mary.

54:33.136 --> 54:35.536
It's the name you
were baptized with.

54:35.571 --> 54:38.233
It's the name
the Lord will call.

54:38.274 --> 54:40.367
What a friend we have in Jesus.

54:40.410 --> 54:42.207
Never forget that, Mary.

54:42.979 --> 54:44.503
Have a nice day.

54:52.322 --> 54:56.190
You can have your mansion!
I'll be just fine in hell!

54:58.094 --> 55:01.188
I hate this about gettin' older.

55:01.230 --> 55:04.996
Think I'm just flappin' my gums
to stir up a breeze.

55:10.340 --> 55:11.466
Rachel?

55:15.678 --> 55:16.906
Rachel?

55:20.516 --> 55:23.314
Well, if you're not gonna come
I'll get a radio...

55:23.353 --> 55:25.514
drown out those
crazy people in the hall.

55:28.691 --> 55:30.488
Course they probably think
I'm crazy too.

55:32.195 --> 55:34.493
Sittin' here alone
talkin' my head off.

55:39.702 --> 55:44.969
Jesus, someone's got
"As The World Turns" on?

55:45.007 --> 55:46.975
What in the hell
are they doin'

55:47.009 --> 55:48.476
spendin' their
last minutes on earth

55:48.511 --> 55:50.138
listening to
"The World Turns"?

55:51.247 --> 55:53.841
I know.
You loved that show.

55:55.184 --> 55:57.550
Lisa and Nancy and Dr. Bob.

56:02.558 --> 56:05.118
Bedpan. Full.

56:11.734 --> 56:12.894
Rachel?

56:16.572 --> 56:18.199
One last game of checkers?

56:23.546 --> 56:25.104
I'll let you win.

56:28.418 --> 56:29.214
My turn?

56:29.252 --> 56:30.719
- Yeah.
- Okay.

56:34.157 --> 56:35.215
King me.

56:35.258 --> 56:36.748
Shit.

56:38.094 --> 56:39.789
I don't think that was fair.

56:42.432 --> 56:44.866
I'm gonna have that kid
bring me a radio.

56:44.901 --> 56:46.664
I can choose my own noise.

56:54.110 --> 56:56.340
You don't hear
anything, do you, Rach?

57:01.951 --> 57:03.441
You're barely here.

57:08.458 --> 57:10.000
You're tryin'
to leave us all behind,

57:10.000 --> 57:10.756
You're Watching 123Movies.to
You're tryin'
to leave us all behind,

57:10.756 --> 57:10.793
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:10.793 --> 57:12.317
and they won't let you.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:12.317 --> 57:17.467
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:17.467 --> 57:18.900
Rachel...
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:18.900 --> 57:21.304
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:21.304 --> 57:22.000
Are you still there?
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:22.000 --> 57:23.101
Are you still there?

57:45.161 --> 57:46.287
Guess I shoulda knocked.

57:46.329 --> 57:47.887
Yes, you should have.

57:51.501 --> 57:52.627
They yours?

57:52.668 --> 57:54.033
Yes.

57:55.671 --> 57:57.696
You were busy
while I was in Alaska.

58:01.177 --> 58:02.303
Still pissed at me?

58:02.345 --> 58:05.075
Yes. And must you
use that language?

58:06.516 --> 58:07.949
Yes.

58:08.851 --> 58:11.046
You didn't write
you were coming.

58:11.087 --> 58:12.486
Didn't wanna warn you.

58:12.522 --> 58:13.887
You just visiting?

58:18.027 --> 58:19.324
Are you a widow?

58:19.362 --> 58:20.829
Yes.

58:20.863 --> 58:22.490
I believe I'm back.

58:23.699 --> 58:26.566
I appreciated the money
you sent me from Alaska.

58:26.602 --> 58:28.661
I didn't want to use it.
I shouldn't have...

58:28.704 --> 58:31.104
You don't have
to explain, Rachel.

58:31.140 --> 58:33.768
In fact...
I wish you wouldn't.

58:35.845 --> 58:37.813
I wasn't paying for anything.

58:41.217 --> 58:42.707
If you ask me upstairs,

58:42.752 --> 58:45.186
I don't want you
mixed up about why.

58:45.221 --> 58:46.711
I haven't asked.

58:51.394 --> 58:52.884
I bet you will.

58:54.730 --> 58:56.197
I'm a mother now.

58:57.567 --> 58:58.534
So?

58:58.568 --> 59:00.195
Get out!

59:00.236 --> 59:01.362
I'm sorry.

59:01.404 --> 59:03.201
You left me, remember?

59:03.239 --> 59:04.536
You got married!

59:04.574 --> 59:07.042
I didn't think that meant
I was going to lose you.

59:08.077 --> 59:10.545
If I had stayed,
what were we supposed to do?

59:10.580 --> 59:12.047
Trade recipes?

59:12.081 --> 59:14.379
I needed you, Hannah.

59:14.417 --> 59:16.544
Don't need me...

59:16.586 --> 59:18.679
Want me, Rachel.

59:19.922 --> 59:21.389
It isn't right.

59:21.424 --> 59:23.551
Why? Because Mr. Johnson
went belly up

59:23.593 --> 59:25.561
in the lake like
a dime store goldfish?

59:25.595 --> 59:27.563
Only you would
put it like that.

59:27.597 --> 59:29.565
This is right for us, Rachel.

59:32.435 --> 59:34.403
Tell me you don't want it.

59:37.607 --> 59:39.438
You know, up in Alaska

59:39.475 --> 59:41.909
when they're lightin' dynamite
someone'll yell,

59:41.944 --> 59:44.105
"Fire in the hole!"

59:46.115 --> 59:48.777
I think that kinda sums us up.

59:51.621 --> 59:53.418
You're just terrible.

59:53.456 --> 59:54.855
The more you shake your head,

59:54.890 --> 59:56.858
the wilder you are
under the sheets.

59:58.594 --> 01:00:00.755
Put those babies
down for a nap.

01:00:03.966 --> 01:00:05.263
If we start...

01:00:06.402 --> 01:00:11.135
<i>If we start...
promise you won't leave?</i>

01:00:15.144 --> 01:00:17.203
Cute babies.

01:00:17.246 --> 01:00:18.611
They got names?

01:00:18.648 --> 01:00:19.945
Promise?

01:00:19.982 --> 01:00:22.780
Tomorrow I want you
to bake me some biscuits

01:00:22.818 --> 01:00:25.013
wearin' nothin' but this apron.

01:00:26.656 --> 01:00:28.317
Hannah, I need an approximation.

01:00:28.357 --> 01:00:29.449
How long will you stay?

01:00:29.492 --> 01:00:31.460
I don't know.

01:00:31.494 --> 01:00:33.394
I don't wanna know.

01:00:33.429 --> 01:00:36.660
Rachel, I need life
to surprise me.

01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:43.298
If I bake you those biscuits...

01:00:45.174 --> 01:00:47.574
will you promise
to stay till spring?

01:00:56.352 --> 01:00:58.843
You make me those biscuits
I'll stay through the summer.

01:01:02.024 --> 01:01:04.322
Maybe till the fall...

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:06.658
You can carve me up
for Halloween.

01:01:16.372 --> 01:01:18.670
Let's put Marge and Roy
in their cribs.

01:01:18.708 --> 01:01:19.766
Marge and Roy?

01:01:19.809 --> 01:01:21.276
Yes, Marge and Roy.

01:01:22.878 --> 01:01:24.869
I shoulda been here
to help you name 'em.

01:02:28.611 --> 01:02:30.806
I gotta go home soon, Mama.

01:02:30.846 --> 01:02:33.337
You know how Mason
has to eat on time.

01:02:35.317 --> 01:02:37.148
When I started
coming up here every day,

01:02:37.186 --> 01:02:38.744
he said that was my business -

01:02:38.788 --> 01:02:40.653
just so long
as I got home in time

01:02:40.689 --> 01:02:41.747
to cook his supper.

01:02:41.791 --> 01:02:43.691
And I do. Faithfully.

01:02:46.395 --> 01:02:49.125
Sometimes I cheat a little bit,

01:02:49.165 --> 01:02:52.066
mix it up ahead of time
and heat it up in the microwave.

01:02:52.101 --> 01:02:53.762
He doesn't seem to care.

01:02:53.803 --> 01:02:55.361
Just so long
as when he sits down

01:02:55.404 --> 01:02:57.634
at exactly 5:30
and leans forward with his fork

01:02:57.673 --> 01:02:59.732
he's got something
to stick it into.

01:03:01.811 --> 01:03:05.008
My goodness,
sounded a little racy.

01:03:05.047 --> 01:03:08.813
And we both know
Mason is anything but racy.

01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:11.820
The only time he gets romantic
is after the Super Bowl.

01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:16.788
I talked to Roy.

01:03:16.826 --> 01:03:20.091
He said that he can't
fly down right now.

01:03:22.097 --> 01:03:24.327
His youngest is still
in drug rehab,

01:03:24.366 --> 01:03:27.961
and Linda is on
her third divorce.

01:03:29.238 --> 01:03:31.138
He does have his troubles.

01:03:32.741 --> 01:03:35.767
Glad my family never
got into that dope.

01:03:35.811 --> 01:03:38.405
At least not that I know of.

01:03:38.447 --> 01:03:42.850
Course you never can tell
about Barbara's girl, Greta...

01:03:42.885 --> 01:03:46.150
I know. You warned me.

01:03:46.188 --> 01:03:49.646
I said, "Barbara,
you have a choice to make.

01:03:49.692 --> 01:03:52.183
You can either ruin your life
with that godless commie

01:03:52.228 --> 01:03:53.855
or you can come home."

01:03:53.896 --> 01:03:56.160
What are they gonna do
in a big town like Minneapolis?

01:03:56.198 --> 01:04:00.362
He's a passionate young man...
and she loves him.

01:04:00.402 --> 01:04:02.836
Marge, don't make her choose.

01:04:02.872 --> 01:04:05.102
Mama, he's a Buddhist!

01:04:09.545 --> 01:04:11.877
<i>I could never understand
why a woman with your good sense</i>

01:04:11.914 --> 01:04:14.974
<i>would spend her life
with that darn Hannah.</i>

01:04:21.056 --> 01:04:24.856
<i>It's wrong.
And everybody says it's wrong.</i>

01:04:24.894 --> 01:04:26.919
<i>The Bible says that it's wrong.</i>

01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:30.330
<i>Not that I would ever
admit that you did</i>

01:04:30.366 --> 01:04:32.630
<i>what everybody in this town
knows you did.</i>

01:04:33.903 --> 01:04:36.770
<i>If somebody baits me,</i>

01:04:36.805 --> 01:04:40.832
<i>I just say
how weird Hannah was,</i>

01:04:40.876 --> 01:04:46.075
<i>and that you have always been
kind enough to stay her friend.</i>

01:04:49.251 --> 01:04:51.879
Not that you two didn't have
your knockdown, drag out fights.

01:04:51.921 --> 01:04:54.822
I would hear you
through the heating vents.

01:04:54.857 --> 01:04:56.688
The two of you would
rather lose an arm

01:04:56.725 --> 01:04:59.387
than say anything
against each other in public.

01:05:02.097 --> 01:05:04.224
I should do that with Mason.

01:05:05.701 --> 01:05:08.499
At least he doesn't
bore me with his talk.

01:05:09.905 --> 01:05:12.840
He doesn't ever
really listen either.

01:05:16.445 --> 01:05:18.640
Did Hannah ever listen to you?

01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:22.645
I guess she did.

01:05:23.652 --> 01:05:26.416
She finally stopped traveling
and stayed home.

01:05:28.991 --> 01:05:32.722
You would always look at her
like she could cure cancer.

01:05:36.699 --> 01:05:39.862
She wants to see you, Mama...

01:05:39.902 --> 01:05:42.700
and I want you
to die in peace.

01:05:43.973 --> 01:05:46.168
And Hannah never
brought you peace.

01:05:48.811 --> 01:05:50.278
I've gotta go.

01:05:50.312 --> 01:05:51.404
Mason's gonna be

01:05:51.447 --> 01:05:53.438
cuttin' that placemat up
into tiny little squares.

01:05:54.416 --> 01:05:55.713
I love you.

01:05:56.552 --> 01:05:59.112
Goodnight. Sleep tight.

01:05:59.154 --> 01:06:00.553
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:06:12.835 --> 01:06:15.633
Why can't you
do that in the garage?

01:06:15.671 --> 01:06:18.640
'Cause it's cold out there
and there's not enough light.

01:06:20.009 --> 01:06:22.307
Besides, you're in here.

01:06:22.344 --> 01:06:23.641
Oh, baloney.

01:06:25.347 --> 01:06:26.871
Why don't ya
come to bed, huh?

01:06:26.915 --> 01:06:28.883
I could wear something else
to Lily's funeral.

01:06:28.917 --> 01:06:30.782
My bowling shirt's clean.

01:06:32.354 --> 01:06:34.219
It's not like I'm gonna be
the star attraction.

01:06:34.256 --> 01:06:35.553
They're all gonna be
lookin' in at Lily

01:06:35.591 --> 01:06:36.819
to see what hair color
they went with.

01:06:36.859 --> 01:06:38.486
Wait.

01:06:38.527 --> 01:06:40.552
You know I've never been
good at waitin'.

01:06:41.897 --> 01:06:43.387
Come on.

01:06:48.537 --> 01:06:49.902
Your neck hurt?

01:07:02.885 --> 01:07:04.682
I'll never get over this.

01:07:13.062 --> 01:07:14.529
Now you kiss me.

01:07:28.577 --> 01:07:31.205
You're in so much trouble.

01:07:31.246 --> 01:07:32.508
Get in here.

01:07:35.918 --> 01:07:37.886
<i>Dear Jackie,</i>

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:41.481
<i>You write such lively letters
I can't compete.</i>

01:07:41.523 --> 01:07:43.218
<i>We don't do much
whitewater rafting</i>

01:07:43.258 --> 01:07:45.419
<i>up here at the home.</i>

01:07:45.461 --> 01:07:48.828
<i>Yes, I think about New Mexico.</i>

01:07:48.864 --> 01:07:51.731
<i>But that's not where
my life is...</i>

01:07:51.767 --> 01:07:53.792
<i>My life's here.</i>

01:07:53.836 --> 01:07:56.361
<i>I guess it always was.</i>

01:07:56.405 --> 01:08:00.865
<i>Go watch the sun rise over
the mountains for me, will ya?</i>

01:08:00.909 --> 01:08:04.606
<i>And good luck
with your golf swing.</i>

01:08:04.646 --> 01:08:06.773
<i>Yours truly...</i>

01:08:12.054 --> 01:08:14.784
<i>Much love, Hannah.</i>

01:08:17.292 --> 01:08:18.316
Hi.

01:08:19.627 --> 01:08:20.925
Hey.

01:08:22.296 --> 01:08:23.764
Feeling down?

01:08:23.799 --> 01:08:24.925
No.

01:08:26.301 --> 01:08:29.600
Why do you keep
comin' back every day?

01:08:29.638 --> 01:08:30.899
If I was your age,

01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:32.566
I sure as hell
wouldn't be wastin' my time

01:08:32.608 --> 01:08:34.939
listenin' to some
old broad beat her gums.

01:08:34.977 --> 01:08:38.104
Well, maybe you just weren't
as sensitive as I am.

01:08:39.982 --> 01:08:41.243
Hannah?

01:08:41.649 --> 01:08:42.617
Still here.

01:08:42.651 --> 01:08:44.618
I hope you won't be mad.

01:08:44.653 --> 01:08:45.483
Don't worry.

01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:47.283
Whatever it is,
you can outrun me easy.

01:08:48.157 --> 01:08:50.455
You know those books
you loaned me?

01:08:50.492 --> 01:08:52.118
Yeah what happened to 'em?
Your dog ate 'em?

01:08:52.161 --> 01:08:53.787
Hannah, they're wonderful.

01:08:54.662 --> 01:08:57.631
Especially the novel.
I couldn't put it down.

01:08:57.666 --> 01:08:59.133
So what's so bad about that?

01:08:59.167 --> 01:09:01.136
You said it wasn't any good.

01:09:01.670 --> 01:09:03.296
Well, that's what I was told.

01:09:03.337 --> 01:09:05.568
Hannah, I hope you
won't be upset...

01:09:05.607 --> 01:09:09.407
I faxed the first chapter to
this professor friend of mine.

01:09:09.444 --> 01:09:11.776
She loved what she read.

01:09:11.813 --> 01:09:13.644
And if you let me
send her the whole thing,

01:09:13.682 --> 01:09:15.309
I know she'll publish it.

01:09:16.852 --> 01:09:19.582
It's not a big
New York publishing company,

01:09:19.621 --> 01:09:21.486
but people could
read your book.

01:09:22.191 --> 01:09:24.283
Jesus, I'd love to see that.

01:09:24.326 --> 01:09:25.759
But you'd better tell 'em

01:09:25.794 --> 01:09:27.488
not to keep it too long
at the printers.

01:09:27.529 --> 01:09:29.997
- Hannah!
- Well...

01:09:30.032 --> 01:09:32.000
Why wasn't it
published years ago?

01:09:32.033 --> 01:09:35.299
Hell, I tried.
I sent it out.

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:38.067
And I got it back. A lot.

01:09:38.106 --> 01:09:43.475
Some guy at Random House
or Scribners

01:09:43.511 --> 01:09:47.743
wrote me a really lousy letter.

01:09:47.783 --> 01:09:49.511
He said he wanted to

01:09:49.551 --> 01:09:51.519
'save me from further
embarrassment'.

01:09:51.553 --> 01:09:53.350
Why? Because it doesn't have

01:09:53.388 --> 01:09:56.289
some guy jacking off
in a bullring in Spain?

01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:00.153
I suspect the reason was

01:10:00.195 --> 01:10:02.186
because it was about
two women together.

01:10:02.231 --> 01:10:04.699
But it's good.
Doesn't that count?

01:10:04.733 --> 01:10:06.257
Happens all the time, honey.

01:10:07.736 --> 01:10:09.795
What the hell.
I've had a good life.

01:10:09.838 --> 01:10:12.170
I did what I wanted,
pretty much.

01:10:12.908 --> 01:10:14.205
Except now.

01:10:15.744 --> 01:10:18.577
Well, even now...

01:10:18.614 --> 01:10:20.411
if I could
just be with Rachel.

01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:22.615
It's not so bad

01:10:22.651 --> 01:10:24.744
coming to the end
if you're not alone.

01:10:25.254 --> 01:10:28.018
Shit. You're awful.

01:10:29.925 --> 01:10:32.052
So why do you
keep comin' back?

01:10:32.094 --> 01:10:33.220
The truth?

01:10:33.262 --> 01:10:34.559
Always.

01:10:34.596 --> 01:10:37.394
She really is
my great grandmother.

01:10:37.432 --> 01:10:38.729
She who?

01:10:38.767 --> 01:10:40.496
Rachel.

01:10:40.535 --> 01:10:43.003
I wasn't lying when
I told the nurse that.

01:10:44.106 --> 01:10:45.232
Are you kiddin'?

01:10:45.274 --> 01:10:46.901
No, I'm not.

01:10:46.942 --> 01:10:48.739
But I met all her family.

01:10:48.777 --> 01:10:50.506
And you met me.

01:10:50.545 --> 01:10:53.139
Years ago, you took me fishing
so I wouldn't hear

01:10:53.181 --> 01:10:56.014
Marge and my mom
fighting about Daddy.

01:10:56.051 --> 01:10:58.383
And we never came back
to Michigan after that.

01:10:58.420 --> 01:10:59.978
But I always remember

01:11:00.022 --> 01:11:03.048
Rachel's hot chocolate
and going fishing with you.

01:11:03.959 --> 01:11:05.449
You're Barbara's girl.

01:11:07.195 --> 01:11:09.220
And you were wearing
a yellow dress.

01:11:10.599 --> 01:11:12.760
Boy, I sure didn't
have you figured.

01:11:12.801 --> 01:11:14.530
I had you figured.

01:11:14.569 --> 01:11:16.264
You and Rachel.

01:11:17.606 --> 01:11:20.439
I came out a couple years ago...

01:11:20.475 --> 01:11:22.943
I've always had
crushes on girls.

01:11:22.978 --> 01:11:25.276
So you want me to be
your lesbian heritage?

01:11:26.214 --> 01:11:27.772
You gonna write
a song about me?

01:11:27.816 --> 01:11:30.148
I just wanted to
get to know you better.

01:11:30.185 --> 01:11:32.085
You and Great Grandma Rachel.

01:11:33.322 --> 01:11:35.654
Jesus Christ...

01:11:35.691 --> 01:11:37.784
That means Marge
is your grandmother.

01:11:37.826 --> 01:11:39.316
Sorry.

01:11:39.361 --> 01:11:40.726
That's why I wanted you

01:11:40.762 --> 01:11:43.162
to get to like me
before I told you.

01:11:45.167 --> 01:11:46.634
So...

01:11:46.668 --> 01:11:48.568
You seen the old battle-ax?

01:11:48.603 --> 01:11:50.264
Only once up here.

01:11:50.305 --> 01:11:52.398
And not on purpose.

01:11:52.441 --> 01:11:54.875
And last year
at Mom's funeral.

01:11:57.813 --> 01:12:00.976
Rachel and I were
in here by then.

01:12:01.016 --> 01:12:05.077
Mom was kind of like
how Rachel is now...

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:07.714
Lots of tubes and machines.

01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:10.758
It was up to me.

01:12:12.227 --> 01:12:14.127
I had to let her go.

01:12:16.798 --> 01:12:19.232
I wish I could do that
for Rachel.

01:12:21.036 --> 01:12:22.765
Well, why don't you?

01:12:23.972 --> 01:12:27.408
I mean, what's the worst
anyone could do, arrest you?

01:12:27.442 --> 01:12:30.002
Lock you up somewhere?

01:12:30.045 --> 01:12:32.013
Got a point there, kid.

01:12:32.881 --> 01:12:34.940
You must hate
seeing her like this.

01:12:40.389 --> 01:12:42.482
I just don't know
if I've got the guts

01:12:42.524 --> 01:12:44.151
to say that last goodbye.

01:12:47.562 --> 01:12:49.689
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:12:49.731 --> 01:12:51.699
What are you doing
with that suitcase?

01:12:51.733 --> 01:12:53.360
What suitcase?

01:12:53.402 --> 01:12:55.165
The one under the bed.

01:12:55.203 --> 01:12:57.603
You just kicked it under there
when you heard me coming.

01:12:58.673 --> 01:13:00.470
Where do you think
you're going?

01:13:01.576 --> 01:13:03.203
The Himalayas.

01:13:04.246 --> 01:13:05.873
Why?

01:13:05.914 --> 01:13:07.882
I just need a change.

01:13:08.717 --> 01:13:10.514
Michigan doesn't
have any mountains.

01:13:10.552 --> 01:13:12.543
I mean, I know
you've got the Porcupines...

01:13:12.587 --> 01:13:14.214
Michigan has me.

01:13:14.256 --> 01:13:15.883
Well, you could come.

01:13:15.924 --> 01:13:18.415
Hannah, I'm older than dirt.

01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:20.758
Right. And you've never
crossed the state line.

01:13:20.796 --> 01:13:22.525
I've never needed to.

01:13:24.366 --> 01:13:26.891
What are you looking for?

01:13:26.935 --> 01:13:31.235
I don't know, exactly.
I just need something different.

01:13:31.273 --> 01:13:34.242
Different just for the sake
of different?

01:13:34.943 --> 01:13:36.035
Yeah.

01:13:36.778 --> 01:13:40.145
Well, that's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard in my life,

01:13:40.182 --> 01:13:43.242
and I've been listening
to you for over 40 years.

01:13:43.285 --> 01:13:44.582
I'll be back by spring.

01:13:44.619 --> 01:13:45.916
Don't you dare!

01:13:45.954 --> 01:13:46.579
What?

01:13:46.621 --> 01:13:49.818
If you walk out that door,
don't come back!

01:13:49.858 --> 01:13:52.224
Get your junk out of my garage!

01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:54.057
And don't send me
a Christmas card!

01:13:54.095 --> 01:13:55.756
Just go. Go!

01:13:55.797 --> 01:13:56.764
Jesus.

01:13:56.798 --> 01:13:59.699
Don't you know
where your home is?

01:14:01.169 --> 01:14:03.262
Don't you know that yet?

01:14:04.306 --> 01:14:07.104
Hannah, a dog
is smarter than you.

01:14:07.142 --> 01:14:09.269
Well, what about what I want?

01:14:11.313 --> 01:14:15.181
All our lives have been
about what you want.

01:14:15.217 --> 01:14:18.482
This is about what I want.

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.954
You've had your chance to roam.

01:14:20.989 --> 01:14:23.651
Now, dammit, stay home!

01:14:23.692 --> 01:14:27.184
Sit on the porch with me,
and mow the lawn.

01:14:27.229 --> 01:14:30.255
Put your clothes in the closet.

01:14:30.298 --> 01:14:31.993
Clean the cat box.

01:14:32.033 --> 01:14:35.799
Don't just visit...
be with me.

01:14:35.837 --> 01:14:38.670
I know every inch
of this place -

01:14:38.707 --> 01:14:42.734
every flower, every nail,
every bullfrog.

01:14:42.777 --> 01:14:45.541
There's just never
anything new for me to see.

01:14:47.182 --> 01:14:50.117
If you can't find yourself,

01:14:50.151 --> 01:14:54.986
be yourself,
here with me,

01:14:55.023 --> 01:14:56.991
where can you?

01:14:57.025 --> 01:15:00.392
- Rachel.
- It's not out there...

01:15:00.428 --> 01:15:02.259
It's here.

01:15:03.865 --> 01:15:05.230
I'll try...

01:15:06.868 --> 01:15:08.495
I'll try.

01:15:09.371 --> 01:15:11.032
Do better than try.

01:15:36.898 --> 01:15:38.695
It's almost dawn, Hannah.

01:15:38.733 --> 01:15:41.702
Just let me sit with her
for a few more minutes.

01:15:41.736 --> 01:15:43.226
Well, sure.

01:15:43.872 --> 01:15:46.136
Look, we don't have
to do this tonight.

01:15:46.174 --> 01:15:48.039
We can wait till tomorrow.

01:15:48.076 --> 01:15:51.773
I never liked doin' that.
Neither did she.

01:15:51.813 --> 01:15:54.304
Wash the dishes now,
don't leave 'em.

01:15:54.349 --> 01:15:55.873
Right, Rachel?

01:15:55.917 --> 01:15:57.248
<i>It's time.</i>

01:16:00.422 --> 01:16:02.652
Rachel...

01:16:02.691 --> 01:16:04.659
What am I gonna
do without you?

01:16:05.594 --> 01:16:07.892
You'll never be without me.

01:16:12.434 --> 01:16:15.062
I look at you two
and that's what I want.

01:16:16.771 --> 01:16:19.569
I'm just sorry you never
got to really know Rachel.

01:16:19.608 --> 01:16:23.567
I do...
Through you.

01:16:23.612 --> 01:16:25.842
<i>Goodbye, kiddo.</i>

01:16:27.616 --> 01:16:29.914
Shit, I heard that.

01:16:31.953 --> 01:16:36.583
So, finally it's your turn
to leave me, huh, Rachel?

01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:41.952
I just wish we coulda had
Greta and her gal over.

01:16:41.997 --> 01:16:46.093
You know, sit and eat
your potato salad on the porch?

01:16:46.134 --> 01:16:47.761
Wouldn't we have liked that?

01:16:48.837 --> 01:16:52.170
We coulda gone to
visit Greta in Minneapolis -

01:16:52.207 --> 01:16:54.368
if I ever coulda
gotten you outta town.

01:16:56.478 --> 01:17:01.939
Ah, Rachel, there are parades
and festivals, newspapers,

01:17:01.983 --> 01:17:04.281
and women's bookstores,

01:17:04.319 --> 01:17:08.483
that we never
in our wildest imaginings...

01:17:09.791 --> 01:17:12.453
I just wish it
could've come sooner.

01:17:16.331 --> 01:17:18.822
So, is that, is that,
uh, is that the one?

01:17:18.867 --> 01:17:21.392
'Cause I don't wanna
just unplug the clock.

01:17:24.172 --> 01:17:26.470
You're sure this is
what you want?

01:17:26.508 --> 01:17:29.170
Hannah, I've had a full life -

01:17:29.210 --> 01:17:32.737
oh, my God,
what a life -

01:17:32.781 --> 01:17:34.510
but it's over.

01:17:34.549 --> 01:17:37.017
Let it be over,
please, Hannah.

01:17:40.021 --> 01:17:42.148
<i>What is going on here?</i>

01:17:42.190 --> 01:17:44.158
I'm giving your mother
her life back.

01:17:44.192 --> 01:17:45.659
You get away from her!

01:17:45.694 --> 01:17:47.127
Grandma, let go of her.

01:17:47.162 --> 01:17:48.527
Where do you get off?

01:17:48.563 --> 01:17:51.157
Hannah's just trying to do what
you should've done months ago.

01:17:51.199 --> 01:17:53.190
You wheel her down here?
How could you?

01:17:53.234 --> 01:17:54.826
She has every right to be here.

01:17:54.869 --> 01:17:55.665
She does not!

01:17:55.704 --> 01:17:57.331
Of course she does.
They're lovers.

01:17:57.372 --> 01:17:58.669
Oh, I hate that word.

01:17:58.707 --> 01:18:01.005
I don't give a shit.
That's what they are.

01:18:01.042 --> 01:18:01.838
You shut up.

01:18:01.876 --> 01:18:03.173
<i>You shut up.</i>

01:18:03.211 --> 01:18:05.338
You have no idea
what this is about.

01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:06.506
Of course I do.

01:18:06.548 --> 01:18:08.675
Just stop it,
both of you.

01:18:09.317 --> 01:18:10.682
Marge, I'm glad you came.

01:18:10.719 --> 01:18:12.380
Oh, I bet you are.

01:18:13.388 --> 01:18:15.049
It's time, Marge.

01:18:16.391 --> 01:18:18.757
You and I oughta
do this together.

01:18:20.061 --> 01:18:23.861
It's not about you;
it's not about me.

01:18:23.898 --> 01:18:25.661
It's about her.

01:18:27.302 --> 01:18:29.930
We both love her.

01:18:29.971 --> 01:18:32.337
And saying goodbye to her...

01:18:34.008 --> 01:18:38.638
hurts us more than
anything in this world.

01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:40.272
But it's time.

01:18:42.917 --> 01:18:44.714
I can't.

01:18:44.753 --> 01:18:46.721
She's ready to go...

01:18:46.755 --> 01:18:48.484
We gotta let her go.

01:18:50.258 --> 01:18:51.919
I love her so much.

01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:57.255
And I've always been
so jealous of you.

01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:01.227
And I always
wanted her to myself.

01:19:02.771 --> 01:19:04.238
Did you hate us?

01:19:05.607 --> 01:19:07.336
I never hated you.

01:19:09.277 --> 01:19:10.904
Remember the moonflowers?

01:19:15.116 --> 01:19:16.947
I still have some
in my garden,

01:19:16.985 --> 01:19:19.419
but I'm the only one
who appreciates them.

01:19:19.454 --> 01:19:21.081
I would.

01:19:21.122 --> 01:19:22.749
<i>Please.</i>

01:19:22.791 --> 01:19:24.759
What was that?

01:19:24.793 --> 01:19:26.260
Her.

01:19:26.294 --> 01:19:27.921
Can't be.

01:19:27.962 --> 01:19:29.088
Listen.

01:19:29.130 --> 01:19:30.597
<i>Please.</i>

01:19:34.636 --> 01:19:36.297
She said please?

01:19:36.971 --> 01:19:39.030
She wants you
to help her, Grandma.

01:19:43.344 --> 01:19:45.744
Why don't you
turn off the I.V.

01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:48.943
Greta...
You unplug that.

01:19:50.819 --> 01:19:53.447
If anyone asks,
if there's ever any trouble,

01:19:53.488 --> 01:19:55.115
I will say I did it.

01:19:56.825 --> 01:19:58.087
It's okay.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:25.186 --> 01:20:26.881
I'll be so lonely.

01:20:39.033 --> 01:20:40.398
Oh, Mama...

01:20:43.304 --> 01:20:44.669
I love you.

01:22:04.285 --> 01:22:05.616
Rachel.

01:22:18.299 --> 01:22:21.268
Wait! Wait for me!
