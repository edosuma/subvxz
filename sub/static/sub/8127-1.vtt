     What the hell is this,     

01:08.001 --> 01:09.768
     the Christian Science      
         reading room?          

01:13.105 --> 01:16.107
              Archie, I'm sorry.

01:16.109 --> 01:18.009
        I didn't expect         
         you so early.          

01:18.011 --> 01:19.277
 I was just reading the paper.  

01:19.279 --> 01:21.846
        Oh, no. Don't think     
        nothing of it, Edith.   

01:21.848 --> 01:22.981
            Think nothing of it.

01:22.983 --> 01:24.716
            Jeez, I could get   
            jollier welcomes    

01:24.718 --> 01:27.351
             down at the morgue.

01:27.353 --> 01:29.154
Archie, you were only gone      
    a couple of hours.          

01:29.156 --> 01:31.289
    What do you want,           
        a 21-gun salute?        

01:31.291 --> 01:33.892
  Would you stand up and cheer  
  if it was me at the door?     

01:33.894 --> 01:35.060
             Well, that depends,
             Meathead,          

01:35.062 --> 01:37.395
         on whether you was     
         coming in or going out.

01:39.932 --> 01:42.466
Did you have                    
a nice afternoon?               

01:42.468 --> 01:44.836
        No, I didn't have       
        a nice afternoon, Edith.

01:44.838 --> 01:45.837
             Sometimes, I wonder

01:45.839 --> 01:47.438
            if this part-time   
            cab driving         

01:47.440 --> 01:48.506
              is worth my while.

01:48.508 --> 01:50.308
              You know, it used 
              to be New York was

01:50.310 --> 01:51.509
                full of dudes   
                grabbing cabs   

01:51.511 --> 01:53.611
        to take their           
        girlfriends to shows.   

01:53.613 --> 01:55.747
                 Now all you see
                 around town is 

01:55.749 --> 01:57.381
             drifters, weirdoes 
             and pre-verts.     

02:00.619 --> 02:03.287
            Out of the chair.   

02:07.860 --> 02:09.560
    Trying to pick up           
     a fare these weekends      

02:09.562 --> 02:13.765
is like trolling for sardines   
with a basketball net.          

02:13.767 --> 02:17.368
      Well, maybe folks is      
      walking more for exercise.

02:17.370 --> 02:19.104
  They're walking more, Edith,  

02:19.106 --> 02:20.805
    because they ain't          
         got no mazuma.         

02:20.807 --> 02:23.274
    They gotta make a choice    
    between cabs or butter,     

02:23.276 --> 02:24.675
  and they're choosing butter.  

02:24.677 --> 02:29.513
Oh, they ought to try margarine.
     It ain't so expensive.     

02:31.383 --> 02:32.583
    Will you get me a beer?     

02:32.585 --> 02:34.819
                     Right away.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.320
             Everything's       
             expensive nowadays.

02:36.322 --> 02:38.022
            It's this inflation.

02:38.024 --> 02:40.058
          The money in this here
          country is sick.      

02:40.060 --> 02:41.659
     Yeah, like the people      
        who control it.         

02:41.661 --> 02:44.195
     Well, when you control     
          some of it,           

02:44.197 --> 02:46.998
I'll listen to your views.      

02:47.000 --> 02:48.566
        Meantime,               
you can mail your opinions      

02:48.568 --> 02:49.934
back to the Kremlin, huh?       

02:51.470 --> 02:53.471
        I thought               
 Nixon's wage and price freeze  

02:53.473 --> 02:55.473
was supposed to fix everything. 

02:55.475 --> 02:57.909
Oh... it's fixing me good.      

02:57.911 --> 02:59.577
        It's about time         
    some politician spoke up    

02:59.579 --> 03:00.611
     for the little fellas.     

03:00.613 --> 03:01.980
    You got McGovern.           

03:01.982 --> 03:04.182
I also got a headache, Meathead,

03:04.184 --> 03:05.950
        and I don't need        
      neither one of them.      

03:10.122 --> 03:14.725
    Oh, gee, lucky me,          
    I got the book section.     

03:14.727 --> 03:15.794
    Look at this here.          

03:15.796 --> 03:18.696
    Come on, come on.           
         All boats in.          

03:18.698 --> 03:21.099
         Arch, you can only read
         one section at a time. 

03:21.101 --> 03:22.700
          Well, I want          
      to look 'em all over      

03:22.702 --> 03:24.068
so I can choose which one.      

03:24.070 --> 03:25.336
  Now, come on, gimme, gimme.   

03:25.338 --> 03:27.305
Here's your beer, Archie.       

03:27.307 --> 03:28.306
            All right, Edith.   

03:28.308 --> 03:29.908
                Just leave it   
                there, huh?     

03:29.910 --> 03:31.209
                  Oh, look at   
                  this, will ya?

03:31.211 --> 03:34.179
                 Meat prices    
                 up again by 8%.

03:34.181 --> 03:36.247
Maybe we ought                  
to turn vegetarian.             

03:36.249 --> 03:38.382
It'd be cheaper                 
and healthier.                  

03:38.384 --> 03:39.951
                Well, I ain't   
                turning that    

03:39.953 --> 03:41.119
                  because it    
                  ain't natural.

03:41.121 --> 03:42.954
         Man was put on         
         this earth to eat meat.

03:45.724 --> 03:46.858
          Who says so?          

03:46.860 --> 03:49.560
          Who says so?          
  The Bible says so, dumbbell.  

03:49.562 --> 03:50.795
    Where does it say that?     

03:50.797 --> 03:54.232
     Aw, come on, will ya?      
      I mean, look it up.       

03:54.234 --> 03:56.301
Jeez, all them old Bible people,

03:56.303 --> 03:57.735
  they was always eating meat   

03:57.737 --> 03:59.804
as soon as they found out       
 that eating apples was wrong.  

04:05.444 --> 04:07.278
          That's true.          
     On special occasions--     

04:07.280 --> 04:08.746
        goats and lambs.        

04:08.748 --> 04:10.148
    Who the hell ever heard     
         of sacrificing         

04:10.150 --> 04:12.116
    a head of lettuce? You?     

04:20.291 --> 04:21.692
      What happened here?       

04:21.694 --> 04:23.962
     What's the matter with     
this little piece of the paper? 

04:23.964 --> 04:25.396
Oh, I took that, Daddy.         

04:25.398 --> 04:26.630
It's of no interest to you.     

04:26.632 --> 04:27.698
                      Oh, I see.

04:27.700 --> 04:29.868
        It's out of the         
        employment section here.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.102
            What's happening?   

04:31.104 --> 04:33.104
          Don't tell me Meathead
          is looking for work.  

04:33.106 --> 04:34.239
No, he isn't.                   

04:34.241 --> 04:36.241
Yeah, well, what are you doing? 

04:36.243 --> 04:37.641
     You trying to save him     
          from reading          

04:37.643 --> 04:39.377
    the embarrassing parts?     

04:40.545 --> 04:41.812
        No, Daddy.              

04:41.814 --> 04:43.414
          I'm the one           
that's applying for a job.      

04:43.416 --> 04:46.885
    Hold it, hold it.           
You're applying for what?       

04:46.887 --> 04:47.919
A job.                          

04:47.921 --> 04:49.520
     You just said yourself     
        how tough it is         

04:49.522 --> 04:50.621
    to make ends meet.          

04:50.623 --> 04:52.924
            Oh, no,             
 you ain't applying for no job. 

04:52.926 --> 04:54.525
        A woman's place         
     is still in the home.      

04:54.527 --> 04:56.761
Oh, that's ridiculous.          

04:56.763 --> 04:58.396
Besides, it's                   
only three days a week          

04:58.398 --> 05:00.431
behind the cosmetic counter     
at Kresslers.                   

05:00.433 --> 05:02.166
          Yeah, Arch.           
 It'll mean a few more dollars  

05:02.168 --> 05:03.868
     coming into the house.     

05:09.074 --> 05:14.112
         Listen to this         
 disgusting comment over here.  

05:14.114 --> 05:16.281
        You know,               
there is a word for a guy       

05:16.283 --> 05:17.615
    that lives off his wife.    

05:17.617 --> 05:18.682
  You ever hear of a gig-olo?   

05:23.755 --> 05:24.755
         Look at this.          

05:24.757 --> 05:26.925
Dogs off                        
the coffee table.               

05:26.927 --> 05:27.992
        All right.              

05:27.994 --> 05:29.394
                Even when Edith 
                and me was broke

05:29.396 --> 05:30.395
                  when we was   
                  first married,

05:30.397 --> 05:31.796
                I never sent her
                out to work.    

05:31.798 --> 05:34.498
     Families was proud         
     in them days, right, Edith?

05:34.500 --> 05:36.834
    Yeah, and hungry.           

05:38.404 --> 05:40.905
              Can't you just say
              yeah and stop?    

05:40.907 --> 05:43.308
Times have changed, Daddy.      

05:43.310 --> 05:44.575
                 Well, as far as
                 I'm concerned, 

05:44.577 --> 05:45.977
                 they've changed
                 for the worse. 

05:45.979 --> 05:47.178
What the hell is the sense      

05:47.180 --> 05:48.379
    of talking to yous two,     
            anyhow.             

05:48.381 --> 05:49.380
                Just get away   
                from me.        

05:49.382 --> 05:50.581
                 Leave me alone,
                 all of yous.   

05:50.583 --> 05:51.849

    What'd I tell you? VD.      

06:17.010 --> 06:20.611
     There's been much talk     
 about our permissive society.  

06:20.613 --> 06:21.879
     Well, this is an evil      

06:21.881 --> 06:24.282
     that we have permitted     
         for too long.          

06:24.284 --> 06:25.483
                 Don't tell me  
                 the bigmouth is

06:25.485 --> 06:26.884
                talking sense   
                for a change.   

06:26.886 --> 06:27.918
Quiet, will ya?                 

06:27.920 --> 06:29.187
 <i>The state must be willing</i>      

06:29.189 --> 06:32.056
      <i>to buy back every gun</i>     
     <i>in private hands.</i>          

06:32.058 --> 06:33.057
                    What?       

06:33.059 --> 06:34.225
He's talking about guns.        

06:34.227 --> 06:37.695
          What the hell has guns
          got to do with VD?    

06:37.697 --> 06:39.030
Will you listen                 
to the man?                     

06:39.032 --> 06:42.566
     <i>Only by enforcing</i>          
      <i>even tougher gun laws</i>     

06:42.568 --> 06:46.437
 <i>can the tide of violence</i>       
      <i>and death be halted.</i>      

06:46.439 --> 06:49.107
          <i>Guns must go</i>          
   <i>before more of them go off.</i>  

06:49.109 --> 06:51.509
Well, that's where              
you're going, buddy boy-- off.  

06:51.511 --> 06:54.745
Hey, what are you               
doing that for?                 

06:54.747 --> 06:56.547
I wanted to hear                
what he had to say.             

06:56.549 --> 07:01.085
    He's a fairy like all       
    of them gun-control guys.   

07:01.087 --> 07:02.520
I'm for gun control.            

07:02.522 --> 07:03.621
        Tell it to her.         

07:03.623 --> 07:05.456
        Maybe she'll get        
     the marriage annulled.     

07:05.458 --> 07:07.058
        Oh, Daddy!              

07:07.060 --> 07:09.193
Archie, what do guns            
have to do with maleness?       

07:09.195 --> 07:11.929
        "What do guns have      
        to do with maleness"?   

07:11.931 --> 07:13.197
              Duke Wayne, buddy.

07:13.199 --> 07:14.265
What?                           

07:14.267 --> 07:15.799
                  Clint Westwood
                  there, buddy. 

07:15.801 --> 07:17.068
What are you                    
talking about?                  

07:17.070 --> 07:19.137
    Gary Cooper, Sergeant York--
Get out of here.                

07:19.139 --> 07:20.738
            I could go          
            on and on and on,   

07:20.740 --> 07:21.939
    but it'll do you no good,   

07:21.941 --> 07:22.973
          because talking to you

07:22.975 --> 07:25.143
            is like casting     
            pearls into wine.   

07:25.145 --> 07:28.112
                    No guns, eh?

07:28.114 --> 07:30.481
     Tell that to old lady      
  Heinzegger down the street--  

07:30.483 --> 07:31.549
                      "no guns."

07:31.551 --> 07:33.217
            She'd have been glad
            to have a rod       

07:33.219 --> 07:34.818
          when them two burglars
          busted in on her      

07:34.820 --> 07:36.054
          last week, huh, Edith?

07:36.056 --> 07:37.721
Archie, how do you expect       
      an 88-year-old woman      

07:37.723 --> 07:39.123
  to go around carrying a gun?  

07:39.125 --> 07:40.124
         I don't know!          

07:40.126 --> 07:41.792
        She can carry it        
    in her elastic stocking     

07:41.794 --> 07:45.530
 next to her very-close veins.  

07:45.532 --> 07:47.298
        All I know              
     is that as an American     

07:47.300 --> 07:49.167
 it is my right to pack a rod.  

07:49.169 --> 07:50.168
             Bull!              

07:50.170 --> 07:51.202
    What do you mean?           

07:51.204 --> 07:52.537
Bull to the Constitution?       

07:52.539 --> 07:54.138
      It doesn't say that       
      in the Constitution, Arch!

07:54.140 --> 07:55.273
I'll prove it to you.           

07:55.275 --> 07:57.475
    I got a copy of it here     
      in my history book.       

07:57.477 --> 07:59.277
    It's right there            
    in your Second Amendment.   

07:59.279 --> 08:00.545
Oh, no, Archie.                 

08:00.547 --> 08:01.979
    That's the one that says    

08:01.981 --> 08:04.315
      "Thou shalt not make      
    any graven image."          

08:07.619 --> 08:09.554
  That ain't the Constitution,  
             Edith.             

08:09.556 --> 08:11.122
        What you said is        
    the Gettysburg Address.     

08:13.125 --> 08:15.126
I'll prove you don't know       
what you're talking about.      

08:15.128 --> 08:16.260
            You just look it up.

08:16.262 --> 08:17.661
              All I know, it's  
              my God-given right

08:17.663 --> 08:18.662
                  as an American

08:18.664 --> 08:20.064
                to have a gun   
                in the house.   

08:20.066 --> 08:21.065
It is not, Archie.              

08:21.067 --> 08:22.266
The Supreme Court               
ruled on that                   

08:22.268 --> 08:23.334
as far back as 1939.            

08:23.336 --> 08:24.902
     What the Supreme Court says

08:24.904 --> 08:28.272
             ain't got nothing  
             to do with the law!

08:28.274 --> 08:29.574
                    They okayed 
                    bussing too,

08:29.576 --> 08:31.542
    till President Nixon        
    give 'em the old one-two.   

08:31.544 --> 08:32.710
All right. Here it is.          

08:32.712 --> 08:34.111
Amendment Two--                 
I'll read it to you.            

08:34.114 --> 08:35.946
             Don't read nothing.
             I can read myself. 

08:35.948 --> 08:37.582
             What does it say-- 
             here, here, here...

08:37.583 --> 08:39.583
        "The right of the people
        to keep and bear arms   

08:39.586 --> 08:40.784
        shall not be infringed."

08:40.785 --> 08:41.885
                      Read that.

08:41.886 --> 08:43.687
Wait a second.                  
You didn't read all of it!      

08:43.688 --> 08:45.356
You did not!                    
Look, look.                     

08:45.358 --> 08:47.725
"A well-regulated militia,      
being necessary                 

08:47.727 --> 08:49.494
"to the security                
of a free state,                

08:49.496 --> 08:51.496
"the right of the people        
to keep and bear arms           

08:51.498 --> 08:52.597
shall not be infringed."        

08:52.599 --> 08:53.598
"A militia," Arch.              

08:53.600 --> 08:54.798
That's what it says             
right there.                    

08:54.800 --> 08:56.200
         Listen, buddy.         
    I don't pay no attention    

08:56.202 --> 08:58.736
    to no Constitution          
 in them pinko books of yours.  

09:01.206 --> 09:03.807
          Did you know that 65% 
          of the people murdered

09:03.809 --> 09:06.277
        in the last 10 years    
        were killed by handguns?

09:06.279 --> 09:08.446
     Would it make you feel     
    any better, little girl,    

09:08.448 --> 09:10.181
    if they was pushed          
        out of windows?         

09:12.151 --> 09:14.552
            Wow, that's         
            convoluted logic.   

09:14.554 --> 09:16.720
        Yes, and that's         
 the kind of straight thinking  

09:16.722 --> 09:18.956
 I'm trying to put across here. 

09:18.958 --> 09:21.392
    I hate that jerk on TV.     

09:21.394 --> 09:22.926
Oh, I get it.                   
I get it.                       

09:22.928 --> 09:24.762
When you thought he was         
talking about VD                

09:24.764 --> 09:25.763
and a permissive society,       

09:25.765 --> 09:27.165
he was smart, huh?              

09:27.167 --> 09:29.567
You find out he was talking     
about gun control, he's a jerk? 

09:29.569 --> 09:30.968
             I'm going          
             to prove it to you.

09:30.970 --> 09:33.371
How many people in the US       
    would like to have guns?    

09:33.373 --> 09:34.572
      Too many. Thousands.      

09:34.574 --> 09:37.575
But how many people would       
    like to have VD?            

09:45.050 --> 09:46.817
None, but what does             
that got to...                  

09:46.819 --> 09:47.818
      Case closed, buddy!       
          Case closed!          

09:47.820 --> 09:49.119
Get out of here.                
Come on.                        

09:49.121 --> 09:51.121
              [DOORBELL RINGING]
[LOUD ARGUING]                  

09:51.123 --> 09:52.823
          I'll get it.          

09:52.825 --> 09:54.625
What do guns                    
have to do with VD?             

09:54.627 --> 09:56.460
    Michael, there's no sense   
    in even arguing with him.   

09:56.462 --> 09:57.662
                There's somebody
                at the door.    

09:57.664 --> 09:59.330
Oh, hello, Lionel.              
Come in.                        

09:59.332 --> 10:00.798
  Oh, no thanks, Mrs. Bunker.   

10:00.800 --> 10:03.201
I mean, I don't want to disturb 
  your quiet evening at home.   

10:03.203 --> 10:05.736
      My mom just asked me      
to drop off your cookbook.      

10:05.738 --> 10:07.871
         Wait a minute,         
     wait a minute, Lionel.     

10:07.873 --> 10:09.607
Come on in. We're having        
a little discussion.            

10:09.609 --> 10:10.808
I want to ask                   
you something.                  

10:10.810 --> 10:12.009
Get out of the way, Edith.      

10:12.011 --> 10:13.611
            Oh, I got to go.    
            Sorry, Mr. Bunker...

10:13.613 --> 10:14.945
This will                       
only take a minute.             

10:14.947 --> 10:16.146
Come on, now,                   
here's a guy                    

10:16.148 --> 10:17.348
who's sure                      
to agree with me.               

10:17.350 --> 10:19.950
          Lionel, what          
do your people think about guns?

10:19.952 --> 10:24.755
    Well, that depends          
     on who's holding them.     

10:24.757 --> 10:27.024
        Daddy, how can you be   
        against gun control     

10:27.026 --> 10:28.726
             with all           
             the assassinations?

10:28.728 --> 10:31.395
    Look at it-- the Kennedys   
    and Martin Luther King,     

10:31.397 --> 10:33.631
     and what about the shooting
     of Governor Wallace?       

10:33.633 --> 10:35.399
        I'm saying              
     maybe Governor Wallace     

10:35.401 --> 10:37.468
     wouldn't have got shot     
if had a rod in his mitt.       

10:39.971 --> 10:43.207
Because the governor was there. 
He could have shot first.       

10:43.209 --> 10:44.408
Archie,                         
what would he be doing          

10:44.410 --> 10:46.444
walking around in a crowd       
with a gun?                     

10:46.446 --> 10:49.146
  What was the other bum doing  
     in a crowd with a gun?     

10:49.148 --> 10:50.581
That's ridiculous, Archie!      

10:50.583 --> 10:51.782
You're talking about            
a human being                   

10:51.784 --> 10:54.184
who may be in a wheelchair      
for the rest of his life.       

10:54.186 --> 10:56.487
  Yes, and if that human being  
         had had a rod,         

10:56.489 --> 10:59.657
then the other human being      
would be in a wheelchair.       

10:59.659 --> 11:01.525
                    Excuse me,  
                    but, Lionel,

11:01.527 --> 11:02.926
              we're gonna be    
              late for the show.

11:02.928 --> 11:03.927
EDITH:                          
Hi, Judy.                       

11:03.929 --> 11:04.928
                  Hi, everybody.

11:04.930 --> 11:05.929
            Hold it, hold it.   

11:05.931 --> 11:07.298
                 Judy? Who's    
                 Judy over here?

11:07.300 --> 11:09.166
              How come everybody
              knows Judy but me?

11:09.168 --> 11:10.834
Well, maybe that's              
because you never met her.      

11:10.836 --> 11:12.303
Mr. Bunker, this is Judy.       

11:12.305 --> 11:13.404
                Hello. It's nice
                meeting you.    

11:13.406 --> 11:14.405
Hiya, pleased                   
to meet you.                    

11:14.407 --> 11:16.407
Well, it's very nice,           
young lady.                     

11:16.409 --> 11:17.875
I mean, your going              
out with Lionel here.           

11:19.311 --> 11:20.811
         I didn't know          
     you done that, Lionel.     

11:20.813 --> 11:22.146
      You're dating, huh?       

11:22.148 --> 11:25.983
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.           
We does all them things.        

11:25.985 --> 11:27.951
We dates, gets married.         

11:27.953 --> 11:30.321
Where'd you think               
we all came from?               

11:30.323 --> 11:31.322
Well, bye, everybody.           

11:31.324 --> 11:32.323
ALL: So long.                   

11:32.325 --> 11:33.324
                        Goodbye.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.058
Bye there. Bye.                 

11:35.060 --> 11:36.360
Daddy.                          

11:36.362 --> 11:39.363
    I will never understand     
    your attitude about guns.   

11:39.365 --> 11:41.932
You will never understand       
my attitude about guns. Why not?

11:41.934 --> 11:44.001
What does it take to get        
through to you, Archie?         

11:44.003 --> 11:45.536
You know,                       
England has gun control,        

11:45.538 --> 11:47.638
and they had less than          
10 handgun murders last year.   

11:47.640 --> 11:49.473
The United States               
had over 8,000.                 

11:49.475 --> 11:50.841
Those are statistics.           

11:50.843 --> 11:54.244
 Don't feed me no sta-stistics. 
    Look at the facts here:     

11:54.246 --> 11:57.848
England, in World War II,       
          nearly lost.          

11:57.850 --> 11:59.650
    We had to go over           
    and pull them out.          

11:59.652 --> 12:00.651
Why did they nearly lose?       

12:00.653 --> 12:02.386
    Because they didn't have    
            no guns,            

12:02.388 --> 12:06.557
    because, in my opinion,     
England is a fag country.       

12:06.559 --> 12:07.558
                That's crazy.   

12:07.560 --> 12:08.793
    I know it's crazy,          

12:08.795 --> 12:10.728
      but they don't never      
      tell you that on TV.      

12:10.730 --> 12:13.364
Archie, we need more guys       
like that station manager       

12:13.366 --> 12:14.598
speaking out against guns.      

12:14.600 --> 12:15.899
          No, no, no!           

12:15.901 --> 12:17.702
    We got too many of them     
      station master guys       

12:17.704 --> 12:19.837
  paving the road to communism  
     in this here country.      

12:19.839 --> 12:22.039
 What we need to hear more from 
    is ordinary Joes.           

12:22.041 --> 12:23.374
    Oh, like you, I suppose?    

12:23.376 --> 12:24.375
                That's right.   

12:24.377 --> 12:25.776
Fine. Good.                     
We'll give him a call.          

12:25.778 --> 12:26.944
                    Get away.   

12:26.946 --> 12:28.446
Come on.                        
What's the matter?              
                    Get lost.   

12:28.448 --> 12:29.447
What? You got cold feet?        

12:29.449 --> 12:30.648
                I ain't got     
                no cold feet.   

12:30.650 --> 12:33.083
Oh, you do too, Archie,         
in bed.                         

12:33.085 --> 12:35.886
You always got cold feet.       

12:35.888 --> 12:37.588
                        Edith...

12:38.724 --> 12:40.825
     Don't torture me, huh?     

12:40.827 --> 12:42.393
    Mr. Bennett, please.        
                What is that?   

12:42.395 --> 12:43.627
      Come on. You scared?      

12:43.629 --> 12:45.429
      Get out of here.          
      I ain't scared of nothing.

12:45.431 --> 12:48.131
 Well, then, come on, prove it. 
  Talk to the station manager.  

12:48.133 --> 12:50.334
 Yes, hello, I have a man here  
who's interested in making      

12:50.336 --> 12:52.336
    a rebuttal to your views    
        on gun control.         

12:52.338 --> 12:54.405
     What kind of a gag is that?
Yes, thank you.                 

12:54.407 --> 12:56.139
         That was his secretary.
         She's putting him on.  

12:56.141 --> 12:57.341
You ain't got                   
nobody on there.                

12:57.343 --> 12:58.342
             Hello, Mr. Bennett?

12:58.344 --> 12:59.677
                Yeah, yeah,     
                he's right here.

12:59.679 --> 13:00.678
Get out of here.                

13:00.680 --> 13:01.679
            Come on. You scared?

13:01.681 --> 13:03.381
Give me that phone.             

13:03.383 --> 13:05.783
      Hello. Who is this?       

13:05.785 --> 13:08.386
              Huh?              

13:08.388 --> 13:10.688
    Yeah, well, no, no, no.     

13:10.690 --> 13:12.089
  See, I didn't make the call.  

13:12.091 --> 13:13.891
It was my son-in-law here       
  monkeying around, and, uh...  

13:13.893 --> 13:15.058
              Oh, you're scared.

13:15.060 --> 13:16.794
Hold the line. What?            

13:16.796 --> 13:17.895
                  You're scared.

13:17.897 --> 13:19.029
I'm scared, huh?                

13:19.031 --> 13:20.664
Yeah, hello.                    

13:20.666 --> 13:23.567
            Listen,             
  this is Archie Bunker here,   

13:23.569 --> 13:25.703
     and, uh, with regards      
    to your editorial           

13:25.705 --> 13:27.104
      on the gun control,       

13:27.106 --> 13:28.972
      I demand equal time.      

13:36.848 --> 13:39.483
  Look. Look, Mr. Martinez...   

13:39.485 --> 13:43.821
Mr. Martinez, this station      
is not anti-Puerto Rican.       

13:43.823 --> 13:45.222
    I would have loved          
         to have filmed         

13:45.224 --> 13:46.356
  your Puerto Rican festival,   

13:46.358 --> 13:48.258
    but I've only got           
        so many cameras.        

13:48.260 --> 13:50.027
      No, no, no, no, no.       

13:50.029 --> 13:51.862
  They're not all out filming   
        Cuban festivals         

13:51.864 --> 13:54.665
  and Black Panther festivals.  

13:54.667 --> 13:57.534
 Yes, I know you're a minority. 

13:57.536 --> 14:00.671
    In this community,          
        most people are.        

14:00.673 --> 14:02.139
        What am I?              

14:02.141 --> 14:04.241
        I'm an American.        

14:04.243 --> 14:06.409
      All right, Italian.       

14:06.411 --> 14:09.546
  What do you mean, "Ah-hah"?   

14:09.548 --> 14:11.048
        Mr. Martinez...         

14:11.050 --> 14:12.049
             Hello?             

14:12.051 --> 14:13.651
          Hello? Hel--          

14:13.653 --> 14:15.452
    Excuse me, Mr. Bennett,     

14:15.454 --> 14:19.123
but while you were on the phone,
  the gay people called again.  

14:19.125 --> 14:21.892
  Put them through to Maurice.  
        He understands.         

14:25.030 --> 14:26.864
Oh, Mr. Bunker's still waiting. 

14:26.866 --> 14:27.865
            Bunker?             

14:27.867 --> 14:29.232
          The gun nut.          

14:29.234 --> 14:30.801
  Susan, don't talk like that.  

14:30.803 --> 14:32.269
        That man is part        
        of our audience.        

14:32.271 --> 14:33.837
        I'm sorry, sir.         

14:33.839 --> 14:36.206
      Show the gun nut in.      

14:36.208 --> 14:38.075
                You can come in 
                now, Mr. Bunker.

14:38.077 --> 14:39.609
Yeah, all right.                

14:39.611 --> 14:40.744
    Hey...                      

14:40.746 --> 14:44.247
          you're him,           
    the guy on the TV there.    

14:44.249 --> 14:45.482

Sorry to have kept you waiting. 

14:47.687 --> 14:49.753
              Would you like    
              some coffee, or...

14:49.755 --> 14:51.989
No, no, no, because             
I just had my lunch here.       

14:53.591 --> 14:54.591
              That's an antique.

14:54.593 --> 14:56.160
No, that's brand-new.           

14:58.563 --> 14:59.897
            I mean, the desk.   

14:59.899 --> 15:01.264
Oh, the desk, yeah.             

15:01.266 --> 15:03.100
Well, I noticed                 
when I was coming in here,      

15:03.102 --> 15:06.469
everything's                    
a little bit out of date,       

15:06.471 --> 15:09.073
but, uh, I guess you're         
pretty comfortable, huh?        

15:11.642 --> 15:14.712
          Well, now, Mr. Bunker,
          we're always glad

            say you represented?

        Uh, group?              
What do you mean by group?      

15:23.455 --> 15:25.122
     Well, on whose behalf      

15:25.124 --> 15:26.523
          do you wish           
     to make this rebuttal?

        on behalf of me.

          Hello, Rabbi.         
          What can I do for you?

15:48.446 --> 15:51.915
 Oh, but we had Rabbi Levine on 
        just last week.         

15:51.917 --> 15:53.717
        I thought               
he put the Jewish point of view 

15:53.719 --> 15:55.853
          quite well.           

15:55.855 --> 15:57.654
    What do you mean,           
  "Rabbi Levine's not Jewish"?

      a whole lot of guys       

16:19.378 --> 16:20.644
         just like me--         

16:20.646 --> 16:23.113
     I mean, down at work,      
     and in Kelsey's bar...     

16:24.849 --> 16:27.217
        and I just want         
     to get on the TV there     

16:27.219 --> 16:28.318
      and tell the public       

16:28.320 --> 16:29.887
      that all this stuff       
    about gun control           

16:29.889 --> 16:33.390
 is, uh, excuse me, garbage...  

16:33.392 --> 16:35.692
          because guns          
 is what made this here country 

16:35.694 --> 16:37.327
    what it is today.           

16:37.329 --> 16:38.728
          No argument.          

16:38.730 --> 16:40.430
            Guns is             
 red, white and blue American.  

16:40.432 --> 16:41.698
      Just like apple pie.      

16:41.700 --> 16:43.200
         That's right,          

16:43.202 --> 16:45.735
    and I believe in seeing     
two sides of the question       

16:45.737 --> 16:47.905
      so that you can show      
the other guy where he's wrong. 

16:52.177 --> 16:53.576
        You know,               
    I never thought of that.    

16:53.578 --> 16:54.744
Yeah.                           

16:54.746 --> 16:56.947
Like, for instance,             
what you said about guns, now.  

16:56.949 --> 16:58.315
        You see, that was wrong.

16:58.317 --> 17:00.951
            You said that       
            guns kill. Wrong.   

17:00.953 --> 17:02.119
People kill.                    
                People kill.    

17:02.121 --> 17:03.586
                That's right.   

17:03.588 --> 17:06.824
  Okay, so how do you propose   
 to stop people killing people? 

17:06.826 --> 17:09.492
          That's easy.          
 Bring back the death penalty.  

17:14.065 --> 17:15.065
Excuse me.                      

17:15.067 --> 17:16.433
                    Go ahead.   

17:20.671 --> 17:21.905
                 Susan, will you
                 have Johnson   

17:21.906 --> 17:23.740
                step in here    
                for a minute?   

17:23.742 --> 17:25.142
            There's something   
            I want him to see   

17:25.144 --> 17:26.977
            before it's extinct.

17:37.922 --> 17:39.289
            Ta-dah!             

17:39.291 --> 17:41.191
         I did it, Ma.          
         I got the job!         

17:41.193 --> 17:43.426
Oh, Gloria,                     
that's wonderful!               

17:43.428 --> 17:45.362
Mike, Gloria got the job.       

17:45.364 --> 17:48.232
  Really? Oh, congratulations,  
      honey. That's great.      

17:48.234 --> 17:49.233
                  Michael, I was
                  so nervous.   

17:49.235 --> 17:50.834
                You know, I had 
                to cross my legs

17:50.836 --> 17:52.236
              so I wouldn't hear
              my knees knocking.

17:52.238 --> 17:56.506
Ain't that a coincidence?       
     Mine used to do that.      

17:56.508 --> 17:58.141
    I remember my interview     

17:58.143 --> 18:00.710
    with the Hercules           
    Plumbing Company.           

18:00.712 --> 18:04.248
     I had to wrap my feet      
  around the legs of my chair   

18:04.250 --> 18:06.917
        to keep my knees        
    from knocking together.     

18:06.919 --> 18:08.752
                    Did it work?

18:08.754 --> 18:10.087
        Oh, yeah,               

18:10.089 --> 18:13.123
    except I forgot about it    
  when I started to stand up.   

18:16.527 --> 18:19.096
             I fell             
right over the boss's desk      

18:19.098 --> 18:21.932
and broke his clock radio.      

18:23.067 --> 18:24.667
         Now hear this.         

18:24.669 --> 18:26.203
         After dinner,          
      I'm taking all of us      

18:26.205 --> 18:28.372
      down to Kelsey's bar      
for a drink to celebrate.       

18:28.374 --> 18:29.672
                      Oh, great.
Oh, good.                       

18:29.674 --> 18:31.008
         Whoop-dee-doo!         

18:31.010 --> 18:34.577
    Ah-hah! You think           
I couldn't do it, but I done it.

18:34.579 --> 18:36.179
              Wait till you see.
You did it, Daddy?              

18:36.181 --> 18:38.215
Archie, that's wonderful!       

18:38.217 --> 18:39.983
Congratulations.                

18:39.985 --> 18:43.387
Oh, I'm so proud of you.        

18:43.389 --> 18:44.254
What did you do?                

18:47.658 --> 18:49.793
  I rebuttaled that guy on TV   
        about the guns.         

18:49.795 --> 18:51.395
MICHAEL: You really went        
down to that station?           

18:51.397 --> 18:52.595
                        Yeah.   
Daddy, you were                 
on television?                  

18:52.597 --> 18:54.597
            Archie, you were    
            on television,      

18:54.599 --> 18:56.099
        and we missed it?       

18:56.101 --> 18:58.335
     Why didn't you call us     
          and tell us?          

18:58.337 --> 19:00.103
            Because I knew I was
            coming right home,  

19:00.105 --> 19:01.504
                  and I'm going 
                  to be on there

19:01.506 --> 19:02.839
        in about two minutes.   

19:02.841 --> 19:04.241
Oh, wow.                        
He's going to be on.            

19:04.243 --> 19:06.243
              This I got to see.
              This I got to see.

19:06.245 --> 19:07.244
              Oh, Edith,        
              they couldn't wait

19:07.246 --> 19:08.245
             to get me on there.

19:08.247 --> 19:09.546
                 They brought me
                 into a studio, 

19:09.548 --> 19:12.149
    sat me down on a stool,     
 told me to do it right there,  

19:12.151 --> 19:13.716
 and I done it there, on tape.  

19:13.718 --> 19:15.953
         Really, Daddy?         
    In your own words?          

19:15.955 --> 19:17.854
    Certainly, my own words,    
          little girl.          

19:17.856 --> 19:19.256
        What else               
do you think they wanted?       

19:19.258 --> 19:21.858
  "Just say it into the camera  
  the way you said it to us."   

19:21.860 --> 19:23.593
                 Here, not yet. 
     [SHUTS OFF TV]             

19:23.595 --> 19:25.295
                 Oh, boy, Edith,

19:25.297 --> 19:26.863
            you should've       
            seen that camera.   

19:26.865 --> 19:29.066
    Oh, with the wheels,        
    everything, the lights...   

19:29.068 --> 19:30.633
                  Did they make 
                  you up, Daddy?
          Sure.                 

19:30.635 --> 19:33.636
        Oh, no, Gloria,         
 they wouldn't have to do that. 

19:33.638 --> 19:35.205
        Archie is real.         

19:38.376 --> 19:42.579
    No. Ma, I mean makeup       
    to cover his 5:00 shadow.   

19:42.581 --> 19:45.615
Aw, nah. They just puffed       
a little powder all over.       

19:45.617 --> 19:47.050
             Yeah,              
  a little Helena Rubinstein.   

19:48.319 --> 19:51.254
            Shut up.            

19:51.256 --> 19:53.790
    And I blew it right off     
 after it was all over anyway.  

19:53.792 --> 19:55.625
      And you really said       
      that guns were okay?      

19:55.627 --> 19:56.626
        I certainly did,        

19:56.628 --> 19:57.727
     and you know something     

19:57.729 --> 19:59.229
about that station master       
          down there?           

19:59.231 --> 20:01.231
 The guy never fired off a gun  
          in his life.          

20:01.233 --> 20:02.232
    He admitted that to me.     

20:02.234 --> 20:03.233
                         So?    

20:03.235 --> 20:04.567
              So?               

20:04.569 --> 20:06.769
    Some crackpot who never     
  fired off a gun in his life,  

20:06.771 --> 20:09.539
 he wants to take the fun away  
    from all the other guys.    

20:09.541 --> 20:11.574
Yeah, that's right, Arch.       
    He's a regular killjoy.     

20:11.576 --> 20:12.942
Yeah, and talking about killing,

20:12.944 --> 20:14.478
     cars kill more people      
        in this country         

20:14.480 --> 20:15.479
     than guns every year.      

20:15.481 --> 20:16.513
    Did you know that?          

20:16.515 --> 20:18.315
      And I told him that       
         on the TV too.         

20:18.317 --> 20:19.316
Archie, that's stupid.          

20:19.318 --> 20:20.650
Drivers don't mean              
to kill people.                 

20:20.652 --> 20:23.653
            Oh, no?             
You ain't driven a cab yet, bud.

20:25.556 --> 20:26.756
                    Here we are,
                    here we are.

        All right, everybody,   
        clam up now.            

20:27.959 --> 20:29.559
Oh, look what they did

21:59.717 --> 22:02.385
    That's incredible, Arch.    

22:02.387 --> 22:04.421
What do you mean, "incredible"? 

22:04.423 --> 22:06.556
        What I said made        
     damn good sense to me,     

22:06.558 --> 22:07.557
            even when I heard it

22:07.559 --> 22:09.626
              played back       
              on the television.

22:09.628 --> 22:10.827
  I hated every word you said,  

22:10.829 --> 22:12.529
but you sure came through       
        loud and clear.         

22:12.531 --> 22:15.232
    Well, experience tells,     
        Meathead.               

22:15.234 --> 22:17.267
     You don't command men      
     on a loading platform      

22:17.269 --> 22:18.801
  without learning something.   

22:20.505 --> 22:22.839
         Wow, this has          
really been quite a day, Daddy. 

22:22.841 --> 22:24.641
     You were on television     
        and I got a job.        

22:24.643 --> 22:25.842
                        Yeah.   

22:25.844 --> 22:28.778
It's him. You're him.           

22:28.780 --> 22:32.649
    The guy I just saw          
 on television down the street. 

22:32.651 --> 22:33.816
          Mr. Bunker.           

22:33.818 --> 22:35.585
         That's right.          
    You seen the show?          

22:35.587 --> 22:37.521
    Yeah. I want                
    to shake your hand.         

22:37.523 --> 22:38.888
            Hey, gee, pleased   
            to meet you.        

22:38.890 --> 22:41.258
          Hey, listen to this...
          the public here.      

22:41.260 --> 22:43.226
Man, I really dug               
what you said                   

22:43.228 --> 22:44.594
about those guns.               

22:44.596 --> 22:46.696
I mean, I couldn't have         
said it better myself.          

22:46.698 --> 22:48.498
Oh, I bet you're                
real proud of him, huh?         

22:48.500 --> 22:49.999
    [GLORIA AND EDITH AGREE]    

22:50.001 --> 22:51.401
                 Well, you know,
                 I'm just trying

22:51.403 --> 22:53.203
      to set the public straight
      on something, that's all. 

22:53.205 --> 22:54.538
      Like when you said,       

22:54.540 --> 22:57.974
     "Guns are what brings      
 law and order to our cities."  

22:57.976 --> 23:00.977
Yeah, and what shoot            
a hundred policemen a year.     

23:00.979 --> 23:02.612
          Who's this?           

23:04.582 --> 23:07.284
    He's only my son-in-law.    
 Don't pay no attention to him. 

23:07.286 --> 23:08.618
He's a meatheaded student,      

23:08.620 --> 23:11.087
and he don't know nothing       
     about the real world.      

23:11.089 --> 23:14.191
    Listen, you ought           
    to listen to him.           

23:14.193 --> 23:15.758
Like when he said, quote:       

23:15.760 --> 23:17.994
      "Guns are just like       
         free speech."          

23:17.996 --> 23:19.462
        Beautiful.              

23:19.464 --> 23:21.030
 Well, the truth is beautiful.  

23:21.032 --> 23:23.099
        Beautiful.              
    You said it all, fella.     

23:23.101 --> 23:25.902
Why don't you have a beer       
            with us?            

23:25.904 --> 23:28.638
Oh, no. Actually,               
I got to get to work now.       

23:28.640 --> 23:31.107
        Uh, Louis?              

23:31.109 --> 23:32.309
Put your money in the hat.      

23:32.311 --> 23:34.244
                            Huh?

23:34.246 --> 23:37.814
        Wallet! Wallet!         

23:37.816 --> 23:39.882
         The wallets? All right,
         don't shoot, now.      

23:39.884 --> 23:41.451
            Here, here, here.   

23:41.453 --> 23:42.885
    Give me your wristwatch.    

23:42.887 --> 23:44.053
Oh, Archie.                     

23:44.055 --> 23:46.155
     Give it to him, Edith.     
         He'll kill me.         

23:47.858 --> 23:49.259
     That's it now, folks.      

23:49.261 --> 23:50.627
             Louis?             

23:50.629 --> 23:51.828
        Oh, by the way,         

23:51.830 --> 23:53.430
          Mr. Bunker,           
 did you pay for those drinks?  

23:53.432 --> 23:54.431
                        No.     

23:54.433 --> 23:55.465
        Bartender?              

23:55.467 --> 23:57.534
     The drinks are on me.      

23:57.536 --> 23:59.269
      Bye-bye, everybody.       

23:59.271 --> 24:00.270
            Bye-bye.            

24:16.754 --> 24:17.754
            Leave me alone.     

24:17.756 --> 24:19.822
         Get away from me!      
                     What? What?

24:19.824 --> 24:21.625
     Just get away from me,     
     Meathead, that's all!      

24:21.627 --> 24:23.693
Took my wallet, all my dough... 
my paycheck, everything gone.   

24:23.695 --> 24:24.694
            Well, that proves   
            my point--          

24:24.696 --> 24:25.895
                    if he didn't
                    have a gun  

24:25.897 --> 24:26.896
                 he wouldn't    
                 have robbed us.

24:26.898 --> 24:28.298
Well, if I had had a gun,       

24:28.300 --> 24:29.733
he wouldn't have robbed us      
            neither.            

24:29.735 --> 24:31.067
 When I reached for my wallet,  

24:31.069 --> 24:34.337
     I'd pull out a pistol,     
    and I'd give it to him.     

24:34.339 --> 24:36.139
Well, he'd have given it        
to you too, Archie.             

24:36.141 --> 24:37.240
              Aw!               

24:37.242 --> 24:38.875
             Yeah, and then     
             you'd both be dead.

24:38.877 --> 24:40.143
         I don't care!          

24:40.145 --> 24:43.012
    At least I'd have           
more money than I got now!
