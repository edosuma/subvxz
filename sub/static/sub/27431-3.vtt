WEBVTT

00:01.127 --> 00:03.254
- Previously on Gotham...
- It's a miracle.

00:03.546 --> 00:05.590
- How do you feel?
- Different.

00:05.757 --> 00:08.301
- His name is Will Thomas.
- Detective Gordon?

00:08.468 --> 00:10.178
My friends-- you'll save them.

00:10.345 --> 00:12.597
Say hello to Butch.

00:14.307 --> 00:16.059
BARBARA (echoing):
No!

00:16.434 --> 00:18.645
Gordon comes with me.

00:19.187 --> 00:21.814
I'll take his head, and you
can have the rest of him.

00:28.571 --> 00:29.697
This what got you
all hot and bothered?

00:29.864 --> 00:30.698
Crazy bi...

00:32.116 --> 00:33.326
Not all square yet, though.

00:33.493 --> 00:35.828
You're gonna help me do
what we all know needs doing.

00:35.995 --> 00:38.039
- What's that?
- Kill Penguin.

00:38.206 --> 00:39.332
- You made it.
- Show me what you got.

00:39.499 --> 00:40.917
LUCIUS:
250 apartments.

00:41.084 --> 00:43.419
Once the kids we've liberated
moved in, word got out

00:43.586 --> 00:45.672
pretty fast that there was a
safe place to live in the city.

00:46.089 --> 00:48.174
(grunts) You wanted to know
where the Street Demonz

00:48.341 --> 00:49.092
base was.

00:51.553 --> 00:52.303
Where is everybody?

00:52.470 --> 00:54.013
Holy crap.

00:56.766 --> 00:57.725
What about that?

00:59.644 --> 01:00.937
Penguin did this.

01:03.815 --> 01:07.527
CHOIR:

02:01.748 --> 02:04.542
Production is steady,
Mr. Cobblepot.

02:04.792 --> 02:07.170
Our stores
contain 512

02:07.337 --> 02:09.922
loaves of bread,
2,001 liters

02:10.089 --> 02:10.923
of filtered water,

02:11.090 --> 02:13.426
400,232 bullets,

02:13.593 --> 02:15.887
- (moans)
- and...

02:16.054 --> 02:18.890
(singing sputters, stops)

02:20.016 --> 02:22.894
Penn, why is my countertenor
out cold?

02:23.186 --> 02:24.979
L-I'm sorry, Mr. Cobblepot.

02:25.396 --> 02:28.650
Uh... everyone
was working through the night

02:28.816 --> 02:29.901
in the bullet factory.

02:30.234 --> 02:32.278
We've been,
uh, shorthanded,

02:32.904 --> 02:34.447
since people started defecting.

02:34.822 --> 02:35.782
Defecting?

02:36.366 --> 02:37.617
You've been holding
out on me, Penn.

02:37.992 --> 02:40.078
A thousand apologies.
I-l simply couldn't stand

02:40.244 --> 02:41.746
seeing you upset
while you were recovering.

02:41.913 --> 02:44.916
Just tell me everything!
(exclaims)

02:45.083 --> 02:47.794
Rumor is they've fled
to a place

02:48.127 --> 02:49.462
called Haven,

02:49.629 --> 02:52.215
in Jim Gordon's sector.

02:52.382 --> 02:55.593
My subjects are fleeing
to Jim Gordon?

02:56.177 --> 02:58.054
After he shot me?!

02:58.221 --> 02:59.889
What about the bounty
on Gordon's head?

03:00.056 --> 03:01.933
We've had trouble
finding takers.

03:02.100 --> 03:03.434
The gangs
are too disorganized,

03:03.559 --> 03:05.436
and-and ordinary people,
well...

03:06.688 --> 03:07.980
they love him, sir.

03:11.275 --> 03:12.735
They should love me.

03:13.569 --> 03:14.237
Without me,

03:14.404 --> 03:16.989
this entire island
would sink into chaos!

03:17.156 --> 03:19.575
It's not just us.

03:20.076 --> 03:23.121
People from every territory
are fleeing to Haven.

03:23.621 --> 03:25.665
(laughs)
Finally. Breakfast.

03:27.166 --> 03:28.918
(grunting)

03:31.421 --> 03:32.338
(whimpers)

03:42.515 --> 03:43.474
Ha!

03:43.766 --> 03:45.893
The Street Demonz!
(chuckles)

03:46.060 --> 03:47.603
To what do I owe
this honor?

03:47.770 --> 03:49.689
You hit our stronghold
and killed our men.

03:49.856 --> 03:52.775
Not just us. You hit the Lo Boyz
and the Undead, too.

03:53.151 --> 03:53.985
Did I, now?

03:54.152 --> 03:55.820
You tagged the scenes
with graffiti

03:55.987 --> 03:57.655
that said "Penguin was here."

03:57.822 --> 03:59.073
You dolt.

04:00.241 --> 04:02.160
If I wanted to
start a gang war,

04:02.368 --> 04:03.453
you'd all be dead.

04:03.619 --> 04:06.205
I wouldn't leave a few
and sign my name.

04:06.372 --> 04:07.874
Someone wanted you to attack me.

04:09.292 --> 04:11.210
- That's a good point.
- Mm-hmm.

04:11.544 --> 04:12.920
We didn't really
think this through.

04:13.087 --> 04:16.966
No. Well, there will be plenty
of time for thinking

04:17.507 --> 04:20.219
when my men are ripping
out your fingernails.

04:20.386 --> 04:21.471
Chain him up.

04:21.637 --> 04:23.222
Wait! No!

04:23.598 --> 04:24.599
Tighten our borders.

04:24.849 --> 04:28.352
No one in or out,
or it's your head.

04:28.603 --> 04:29.437
(chuckles)

04:31.773 --> 04:32.565
(dag whines)

04:35.234 --> 04:36.611
That's right, Edward.

04:36.778 --> 04:38.654
It's Mr. Peon's head!

04:39.572 --> 04:42.950
It's his head! You're
a good dog, aren't you?

04:47.455 --> 04:48.498
(grunts)

05:09.268 --> 05:10.394
(coughs)

05:27.578 --> 05:29.455
<i>IS'</i>

05:43.761 --> 05:45.638
<i>IS'</i>

05:51.185 --> 05:52.311
<i>BULLOCK:
Word of this place is spreading</i>

05:52.478 --> 05:54.564
like a bad case of the clap.
We got refugees

05:54.730 --> 05:56.566
coming in from every
territory in Gotham.

05:56.732 --> 05:58.943
Can you blame 'em? You saw
what it was like out there.

05:59.485 --> 06:01.362
People being starved
and terrorized,

06:01.529 --> 06:03.322
used by the gangs
as slave labor.

06:03.489 --> 06:05.825
You think those same gangs
aren't gonna want 'em back?

06:06.158 --> 06:08.452
Sooner or later, they're
gonna come looking for us.

06:09.745 --> 06:10.580
Let 'em.

06:10.830 --> 06:12.498
Hey, I get it,

06:12.957 --> 06:15.918
but after our excursion through
nightmareville last week,

06:16.669 --> 06:18.671
we hardly have any
ammo left-- sorry--

06:18.838 --> 06:20.339
and we barely have any food.

06:20.506 --> 06:21.883
Okay, all right.

06:22.091 --> 06:23.718
This is the only safe place
left in Gotham.

06:23.843 --> 06:24.886
I'm not turning people away.

06:25.136 --> 06:27.013
I was afraid
you were gonna say that.

06:27.513 --> 06:29.599
- Hey, how you feeling? How, is uh...
- I'm fine.

06:30.641 --> 06:31.934
You getting any sleep?

06:33.477 --> 06:35.646
You've been going full tilt
for months.

06:36.230 --> 06:37.857
Carrying the weight of everyone.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.401
Share the load.
We can't have you fall apart.

06:40.902 --> 06:43.321
Thanks. I'm okay.

06:51.495 --> 06:53.247
Please tell me some good news.

06:53.998 --> 06:55.499
Water purification system
repurposed

06:55.666 --> 06:57.376
from Wayne Enterprises tech.

06:59.337 --> 07:01.589
I know it's a drop in the
bucket, but every bit helps.

07:01.797 --> 07:04.258
- That's the last can of beans! I ain't
had my rations yet! - Think I have?

07:04.425 --> 07:07.053
- (chatter continues) - Hey, break it up.
Break it up! Break it up.

07:14.852 --> 07:16.646
For all the new people here...

07:17.730 --> 07:20.274
everyone is welcome in Haven,
but there are rules.

07:20.858 --> 07:23.611
And one of them is we leave
the fighting outside.

07:26.697 --> 07:28.908
Government already thinks
we don't deserve help.

07:29.867 --> 07:31.786
We have to show otherwise.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.958
Gangs want to tear themselves
apart outside,

07:37.124 --> 07:38.167
that's their business.

07:38.334 --> 07:40.127
In here, in Haven...

07:43.005 --> 07:44.757
...we help each other survive.

07:55.643 --> 07:57.061
Your speech worked.

07:57.603 --> 07:58.813
For now.

07:59.313 --> 08:01.816
What happens when they find out
the government abandoned them?

08:03.401 --> 08:04.276
Sorry.

08:04.610 --> 08:05.528
For what?

08:06.821 --> 08:08.364
Jim, you're holding
this place together.

08:08.823 --> 08:10.491
You're giving these people hope.

08:10.992 --> 08:12.618
Hope can only go so far.

08:13.536 --> 08:14.704
Not to put more on your plate,

08:14.870 --> 08:17.999
but the kid whose friends
you saved from the slavers--

08:18.416 --> 08:20.292
his bunkmates say
he's been having nightmares.

08:20.626 --> 08:23.129
Last night he fell off his bed
half-asleep, broke his arm.

08:23.295 --> 08:24.755
Maybe you could
talk to him.

08:25.506 --> 08:26.215
(mouths)

08:30.177 --> 08:31.137
Hey.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.350
You don't feel like
joining the other kids?

08:39.270 --> 08:41.731
We can't even begin to imagine
what you've been through.

08:43.024 --> 08:45.234
But it's over.
You're safe now.

08:46.110 --> 08:49.488
I promise I will never
let anyone hurt you ever again.

08:50.823 --> 08:51.532
Okay?

08:54.410 --> 08:55.953
I got something for you.

08:58.831 --> 09:00.041
From my rations.

09:00.458 --> 09:01.917
Little pineapple.

09:04.879 --> 09:06.255
Hang in there.

09:08.674 --> 09:10.843
I'll come check on you
later, okay?

09:13.012 --> 09:14.305
(Gordon sighs)

09:18.184 --> 09:20.644
(indistinct conversations)

09:25.483 --> 09:26.233
Sefina?

09:26.400 --> 09:27.318
One second.

09:28.027 --> 09:28.736
What are you doing
out of bed?

09:28.903 --> 09:30.112
The doctor said
you need rest.

09:30.863 --> 09:32.740
Does it look like
I need rest?

09:34.408 --> 09:35.826
No,but"

09:35.993 --> 09:39.371
Look, whatever
lvy's root did to me...

09:40.247 --> 09:41.916
I've never felt better.

09:43.417 --> 09:45.711
So now I have to find
the freak who shot me.

09:47.671 --> 09:49.298
I've been looking for Jeremiah
since the bridges blew.

09:49.465 --> 09:50.633
I haven't found a thing.

09:50.966 --> 09:52.676
Right, but there have
never been refugees

09:52.843 --> 09:54.637
in the Green Zone before.

09:56.430 --> 09:58.766
These people come
from all over Gotham, Bruce.

09:58.933 --> 10:01.519
Someone has to know something.

10:02.311 --> 10:05.272
I want to find Jeremiah
just as much as you do.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.442
But even if we find him, he's
had months to fortify himself.

10:08.609 --> 10:09.777
We can't go after him alone.

10:10.194 --> 10:11.320
You scared, Bruce?

10:11.654 --> 10:13.114
(quietly):
Of course I'm scared.

10:14.740 --> 10:16.408
Jeremiah shot you to get to me.

10:16.575 --> 10:17.785
He almost killed you.

10:18.244 --> 10:19.120
I won't lose you.

10:20.204 --> 10:21.872
I'm not yours to lose.

10:24.166 --> 10:28.212
You can't stop me
from going after Jeremiah.

10:29.672 --> 10:31.715
But I am asking
you for help.

10:33.175 --> 10:34.802
We take him down,
we do it right.

10:35.261 --> 10:36.262
We bring him back here,

10:36.428 --> 10:38.973
and he stands trial for turning
Gotham into a madhouse.

10:40.808 --> 10:41.934
(chuckles softly)

10:42.101 --> 10:42.852
What?

10:52.862 --> 10:54.822
I was hoping
I could count on you.

10:57.199 --> 11:00.953
I heard rumors about Jeremiah
in the Dark Zone,

11:01.203 --> 11:03.497
but who knows if they're true.

11:04.248 --> 11:05.291
SELINA:
The Dark Zone?

11:05.416 --> 11:06.792
On the other end of the island.

11:07.376 --> 11:08.544
It's chaos,

11:10.004 --> 11:12.715
ruled by those who've
lost their minds

11:12.882 --> 11:15.092
since the bridges
went down.

11:17.720 --> 11:23.475
They said Jeremiah is there,
gathering followers.

11:24.185 --> 11:25.311
Sounds like a lead.

11:25.728 --> 11:27.855
No. You can't go there.

11:28.022 --> 11:29.064
You'll die.

11:29.398 --> 11:30.858
We fought Jeremiah before.

11:31.192 --> 11:33.110
You don't understand.

11:33.569 --> 11:34.695
If you go to the Dark Zone,

11:34.862 --> 11:37.573
Jeremiah is the least
of your worries.

11:38.157 --> 11:40.242
Everyone there
is insane.

11:41.535 --> 11:44.455
Look at what they did
to my friend.

11:54.882 --> 11:58.802
- Penn, where the...?!
- OLGA: ♪ Penguin, my hero ♪

11:59.053 --> 12:02.348
♪ He having no fear-o... ♪

12:02.514 --> 12:03.182
Stop.

12:03.349 --> 12:06.435
- ♪ He bringing joy and cheer-0. ♪
- Stop!

12:07.186 --> 12:08.062
Where is my staff?

12:08.229 --> 12:09.188
Where is Mr. Penn?

12:09.939 --> 12:12.733
Um, they're having to, um...

12:13.484 --> 12:16.153
defected to Haven.

12:17.529 --> 12:19.490
And my guards didn't stop them?

12:21.951 --> 12:22.952
My guards, too?

12:25.537 --> 12:26.497
Edward?

12:28.457 --> 12:30.251
Edward! Edward!

12:33.170 --> 12:34.755
They took my dog?

12:35.339 --> 12:39.051
Rumors say pup went willingly.

12:39.969 --> 12:42.638
Lies!

12:48.394 --> 12:49.853
You're in luck,
my friend.

12:50.062 --> 12:53.190
Jim Gordon is luring people
from every territory in Gotham

12:53.440 --> 12:54.733
including yours.

12:55.067 --> 12:57.444
As our interests
are now aligned,

12:57.945 --> 13:01.115
I have decided
that you may live.

13:06.912 --> 13:08.831
He's been dead since yesterday.

13:10.040 --> 13:12.835
Contact the Lo Boyz
and the Undead.

13:13.294 --> 13:16.005
You have men,
vehicles and gas.

13:16.255 --> 13:17.715
I have the bullets.

13:18.590 --> 13:21.969
It's time we paid a visit
to this Haven...

13:23.595 --> 13:25.014
right after I put on
some clothes.

13:29.643 --> 13:32.438
Jim! Border guards
just radioed.

13:33.063 --> 13:34.440
Penguin broke through
the barricades.

13:34.606 --> 13:36.066
Street Demonz, other
gangs rolling with him.

13:36.233 --> 13:37.693
They're heading for Haven.

13:38.152 --> 13:40.487
- We can beat them there. Load up!
- What the hell are we gonna do?

13:40.654 --> 13:43.574
- We don't have more than a dozen
bullets between us. - You're right.

13:44.325 --> 13:45.326
We get in a firefight
and we're dead.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.786
Okay, I'm gonna need you
to go get some help.

13:48.037 --> 13:49.705
I'm not sure we got
any friends left.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.999
I'm hoping we still have one.

13:52.624 --> 13:54.668
(dog barking)

13:59.590 --> 14:01.633
So, this is the Dark Zone.

14:03.385 --> 14:04.928
They should call it
the Dull Zone.

14:05.804 --> 14:07.056
Place is dead.

14:08.849 --> 14:10.267
(chuckles) What?

14:10.809 --> 14:12.102
You seem yourself again.

14:13.395 --> 14:14.396
I'm glad.

14:16.690 --> 14:18.442
Wait, I know this block.

14:19.777 --> 14:21.737
Used to be
the posh part of town.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.823
Everyone with
money got out.

14:25.532 --> 14:26.575
You didn't.

14:28.369 --> 14:30.079
I had a reason to stay.

14:39.046 --> 14:40.089
MAN:
Oh, God!

14:40.422 --> 14:41.965
Help me, please.

14:42.633 --> 14:43.634
- Wait. Wait, wait.
- Come on.

14:44.218 --> 14:45.260
Oh, God.

14:45.427 --> 14:46.470
Get down.

14:53.811 --> 14:56.563
(people cackling)

14:59.650 --> 15:02.403
Now we know who carved "kill"
into that guy's chest.

15:04.321 --> 15:06.573
Do you think they know
anything about Jeremiah?

15:07.199 --> 15:09.076
Let's find someone
else to ask.

15:09.743 --> 15:12.579
Let's go before
they see us.

15:18.752 --> 15:19.461
(chuckles)

15:19.962 --> 15:20.754
Kill!

15:21.713 --> 15:22.965
We're not here for you.

15:23.966 --> 15:25.884
We're looking
for Jeremiah Valeska.

15:26.760 --> 15:29.096
Kill you. Kill Jeremiah.

15:29.346 --> 15:32.391
I don't think this guy is
much of a talker, Bruce.

15:35.185 --> 15:36.311
What do you want to do?

15:36.603 --> 15:37.479
Easy.

15:40.023 --> 15:42.151
Find the schoolyard's
biggest bully...

15:44.653 --> 15:46.238
- (shouts)
- ...and kick his teeth in.

15:50.451 --> 15:52.035
(grunts)
The chicky-chick is mine.

16:00.836 --> 16:01.712
Selina.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.472
♪ Mine eyes have seen
the glory ♪

16:11.638 --> 16:13.599
♪ Of the coming of the Lord ♪

16:13.807 --> 16:15.893
♪ He is trampling out
the vintage ♪

16:16.059 --> 16:17.686
♪ Where the grapes of
wrath are stored... ♪

16:19.313 --> 16:21.690
Everyone inside.
Inside.

16:23.567 --> 16:24.860
Let's go. Get inside.

16:25.444 --> 16:26.570
(screams)

16:26.820 --> 16:28.071
What's going on, Captain Gordon?

16:28.697 --> 16:29.698
Inside, go.

16:33.410 --> 16:34.745
Hold your fire.

16:40.292 --> 16:41.919
Hold your fire.

16:54.473 --> 16:58.227
Well, if it isn't
my old friend Mr. Penn

16:59.353 --> 17:02.397
and the Gertrud Kapelput
Memorial Choir.

17:02.564 --> 17:07.444
Oh, it is so nice to see
some familiar faces!

17:07.611 --> 17:09.195
You shouldn't have
come here, Oswald.

17:09.363 --> 17:13.659
Oh, well, perhaps you shouldn't
have stolen my people or my dog.

17:13.992 --> 17:16.411
Every refugee is here
of their own free will

17:16.578 --> 17:18.413
and under the protection
of the GCPD.

17:18.579 --> 17:19.873
Edward!

17:20.040 --> 17:20.999
Edward!

17:22.041 --> 17:23.210
Come here!

17:24.795 --> 17:26.003
Right now!

17:27.297 --> 17:28.674
I will make this
very simple, Jim.

17:29.132 --> 17:34.179
You return our people
and Edward and an apology

17:34.513 --> 17:37.224
or we will destroy
this little commune of yours

17:37.391 --> 17:39.685
and salt the earth
on which it stands.

17:39.851 --> 17:40.644
The answer is no.

17:40.811 --> 17:42.688
Now turn around
unless you want a bloodbath.

17:42.854 --> 17:44.523
Let me explain something, Jim.

17:45.107 --> 17:46.567
I heard about your
little excursion

17:46.733 --> 17:48.026
through the territories.

17:48.193 --> 17:51.113
So, whatever ammo
you stole from me,

17:51.530 --> 17:54.116
I'm betting you
used it up,

17:54.283 --> 17:56.952
which means you're bluffing.

18:08.046 --> 18:09.798
You want to test us, Oswald?

18:11.758 --> 18:13.927
I'm sure my men could use
the target practice.

18:15.345 --> 18:16.847
Slice and dice,
little chicky.

18:17.014 --> 18:18.015
You look soft.

18:18.181 --> 18:19.933
You look like
300 pounds of ugly.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.144
(laughs) Kill and kill.

18:26.732 --> 18:27.816
Where's Jeremiah?

18:40.746 --> 18:42.581
(shouts)

18:46.376 --> 18:47.085
Where is Jeremiah?

18:47.252 --> 18:48.086
Jeremiah?

18:49.087 --> 18:50.547
(groans)

18:53.258 --> 18:56.094
Tell me where Jeremiah is
or my face

18:56.428 --> 19:00.098
is going to be the last thing
you ever see.

19:00.265 --> 19:01.933
Old Town North, okay?

19:02.184 --> 19:03.310
We don't mess with him.

19:03.727 --> 19:05.145
Old Town North?

19:05.896 --> 19:07.356
You wouldn't lie to me,
would you?

19:07.814 --> 19:09.024
It's the truth.

19:14.571 --> 19:15.822
Selina, he's had enough.

19:16.114 --> 19:16.948
He's had enough

19:17.115 --> 19:19.534
when I say he's had enough.

19:25.332 --> 19:27.376
(Selina grunts)

19:28.710 --> 19:30.170
What the hell?

19:33.131 --> 19:34.299
You won.

19:35.133 --> 19:36.176
It's over.

19:38.011 --> 19:39.846
SELINA:
Old Town North. See?

19:40.681 --> 19:42.391
That was easy.

19:44.476 --> 19:45.852
What are we waiting for?

19:51.566 --> 19:52.859
You said they'll be
out of bullets.

19:53.026 --> 19:54.319
He's bluffing,
you idiot.

19:54.486 --> 19:55.362
How do you know?

19:56.154 --> 19:57.656
I know Jim Gordon.

19:58.448 --> 20:00.826
But if you require
a demonstration,

20:01.702 --> 20:03.120
three of you, march.

20:03.412 --> 20:05.122
But, uh, they have guns.

20:06.248 --> 20:08.667
(chuckles) So do I

20:09.543 --> 20:11.294
and mine is most
certainly loaded.

20:15.298 --> 20:16.341
On my mark.

20:19.803 --> 20:20.846
Make them count.

20:23.724 --> 20:25.642
(gun clicking)

20:33.275 --> 20:34.401
OSWALD:
Ah.

20:34.943 --> 20:36.069
Well, Jim,

20:36.862 --> 20:38.947
it seems you are
out of ammo, after all.

20:39.990 --> 20:41.950
Now, if you don't
want your men

20:42.117 --> 20:44.453
to die in a hail of bullets,
you know what to do.

20:50.459 --> 20:51.668
Fine. On the count of three.

20:51.835 --> 20:53.545
- One, two...
- All right.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.756
All right. Put them down.

20:57.883 --> 20:59.009
Put them down.

21:16.985 --> 21:18.695
Selina, what was that
back there?

21:19.112 --> 21:20.280
They had to know I was serious.

21:22.449 --> 21:23.867
You didn't have to
hurt him like that.

21:24.034 --> 21:25.535
He was trying to kill me, Bruce,

21:26.286 --> 21:28.205
just like Jeremiah
tried to kill me.

21:28.747 --> 21:30.582
So as far as I'm concerned...

21:32.918 --> 21:34.211
he got off easy.

21:36.713 --> 21:38.215
Whose side are
you on, Bruce?

21:39.299 --> 21:42.010
Yours. Always.

21:42.385 --> 21:44.387
Then let's do
what we came here to do.

21:49.434 --> 21:50.894
Looks like we're close.

22:07.661 --> 22:08.745
When I see him,

22:09.496 --> 22:11.248
I'm gonna tear
his throat out.

22:12.123 --> 22:13.166
BRUCE:
Selina.

22:29.516 --> 22:31.768
Welcome, pilgrims,

22:32.102 --> 22:34.604
to The Church of
Jeremiah Valeska.

22:35.146 --> 22:37.566
The only place
where you faithful pilgrims

22:37.732 --> 22:40.902
can become
your very best selves.

22:41.278 --> 22:42.737
(quietly):
Who the hell is that?

22:43.405 --> 22:44.239
I don't know.

22:45.448 --> 22:47.742
I bet she knows
where Jeremiah is, though.

22:48.577 --> 22:49.911
Stay here.
I'm gonna get a closer look.

22:50.120 --> 22:52.497
No. We do this together, Selina.

22:52.664 --> 22:53.582
That was the deal.

22:53.748 --> 22:55.500
Funny, I don't remember
saying that.

22:55.667 --> 22:59.254
Now, I know you've come
from far and wide

22:59.421 --> 23:01.131
to meet the man himself.

23:01.339 --> 23:06.094
But first,
he requires a show of faith.

23:06.761 --> 23:07.929
Don't be shy.

23:08.346 --> 23:10.473
Jeremiah awaits.

23:10.891 --> 23:12.517
Who is ready?

23:16.104 --> 23:17.856
(gasps)
Lovely.

23:18.440 --> 23:21.318
Jeremiah will be so happy.

23:21.776 --> 23:24.738
But remember:
he wants only

23:24.905 --> 23:27.324
the most faithful
followers.

23:28.283 --> 23:31.953
And you all have a chance
to prove yourself,

23:32.412 --> 23:36.124
right up those stairs.

23:42.047 --> 23:45.050
And the rest of you, get out!

23:47.427 --> 23:48.428
Selina.

23:50.388 --> 23:51.473
SELINA:
Wait.

23:52.682 --> 23:54.142
I want to meet Jeremiah.

23:54.351 --> 23:57.562
You don't look like one
of Jeremiah's worshipers.

23:57.938 --> 24:02.150
I have witnessed
his work firsthand.

24:03.026 --> 24:04.778
I will never forget it.

24:06.863 --> 24:08.782
Then right this way.

24:24.506 --> 24:25.590
(speaking indistinctly)

24:43.733 --> 24:44.567
You're gonna regret this.

24:44.776 --> 24:46.945
(laughs)
Strong words,

24:47.112 --> 24:48.697
for someone who is
out of options.

24:48.863 --> 24:50.448
Flaughs)

24:50.615 --> 24:54.577
First, I'm gonna make you watch
while I destroy Haven.

24:56.830 --> 24:59.249
Then, I'm gonna shoot you
and leave you for dead,

24:59.416 --> 25:01.418
just like you did to me.
Sound fair?

25:01.584 --> 25:04.796
If the government liberates the
city and finds out about this,

25:04.963 --> 25:06.339
you'll be at the top
of their list.

25:06.715 --> 25:07.716
Wake up, Jim.

25:08.049 --> 25:09.843
The government has abandoned us.

25:10.260 --> 25:14.723
The only law in Gotham is power,
and that power belongs to me.

25:15.682 --> 25:17.017
We have children here. Families.

25:17.183 --> 25:18.685
What happens when
the gangs take them?

25:18.852 --> 25:24.357
Hmm. They probably go back
to being slaves, I guess.

25:25.984 --> 25:27.360
My people, on the other hand,

25:27.527 --> 25:29.446
will go back
to their regular lives,

25:29.696 --> 25:32.157
with their bellies full of gruel
and their heads full

25:32.323 --> 25:36.202
of wonderful thoughts
about their grand protector, me.

25:36.786 --> 25:39.789
If this is about revenge
against me, do your worst.

25:40.040 --> 25:41.499
But leave the refugees
out of it.

25:41.833 --> 25:43.043
So heroic.

25:44.085 --> 25:45.170
Almost tempting.

25:45.879 --> 25:48.548
But I think I'm gonna stick
to my original plan.

25:52.719 --> 25:54.929
Uh, Jim's gonna die,
isn't he, boy?

25:55.096 --> 25:56.598
Oh, you're a good dog,
yes, you are.

26:03.605 --> 26:04.522
Mr. Cobblepot.

26:04.689 --> 26:07.192
Stop. That one belongs to me.

26:07.817 --> 26:11.488
No can do. You sacrificed one of
my guys calling the cop's bluff.

26:12.238 --> 26:13.406
So what?

26:14.449 --> 26:15.867
I said he's mine.

26:17.243 --> 26:19.537
Oh, thank you,
Mr. Cobblepot.

26:22.082 --> 26:23.833
Then how about we
take your territory?

26:24.000 --> 26:25.168
And your bullet factory.

26:25.335 --> 26:27.212
Penn!Penn!

26:27.378 --> 26:29.214
(panting)

26:29.714 --> 26:32.050
I'm sorry, Mr. Cobblepot.

26:32.967 --> 26:34.511
You fool!

26:34.886 --> 26:37.055
This never would have happened
if you stayed with me.

26:37.222 --> 26:38.598
Why did you leave?

26:40.308 --> 26:42.477
Everyone hated you.

26:54.781 --> 26:58.243
You will pay for this!

26:59.077 --> 27:02.163
Hey, Penguin,
you got something on your face.

27:03.248 --> 27:05.500
Let me go! We had a deal!

27:05.667 --> 27:07.085
Shut your mouth...

27:10.797 --> 27:14.884
...or the next thing that comes
out your mouth is a bullet.

27:16.344 --> 27:17.887
Man, you are on fire!

27:22.142 --> 27:24.185
I take it that didn't work out
the way you'd hoped.

27:29.149 --> 27:30.316
Barbara?

27:32.944 --> 27:34.028
Barbara?

27:34.654 --> 27:36.114
Hey, you in here?

27:38.741 --> 27:39.576
You've gotten good at that.

27:39.742 --> 27:41.744
(chuckles)
Haven't you heard, Harvey?

27:41.911 --> 27:43.621
No men in the Sirens
past midnight.

27:43.788 --> 27:46.082
Sorry to bust up ladies' night,
but Jim Gordon needs your help.

27:46.249 --> 27:50.920
Oh, perhaps it's time Golden Boy
learned to save himself.

27:51.462 --> 27:53.590
And aren't you tired
of playing sidekick?

27:54.257 --> 27:55.592
See, I don't see it that way.

27:55.884 --> 27:57.010
Me and Jim are friends.

27:57.343 --> 27:59.053
We're fighting
for the same thing.

27:59.304 --> 28:00.388
It seemed like you got that.

28:00.555 --> 28:02.098
(chuckles)

28:02.557 --> 28:05.685
You know, I remember
when you first partnered up.

28:07.896 --> 28:10.106
He, the idealistic rookie.

28:10.857 --> 28:12.442
You, the cynical veteran.

28:12.650 --> 28:13.693
You were sane.

28:13.860 --> 28:16.404
(laughs) Now you
carry his laundry.

28:17.488 --> 28:18.406
Do you ever wonder
what your life

28:18.573 --> 28:22.285
might've been like
if you'd never met Jim Gordon?

28:22.452 --> 28:25.288
I'd be dead, or wishing I was.

28:26.080 --> 28:27.916
You're delusional, Harvey.

28:28.833 --> 28:31.669
Just like all the sad saps
who think the government

28:31.836 --> 28:33.880
is just gonna sail in
and save them.

28:34.631 --> 28:37.383
Maybe. And look, I know you've
had your differences with Jim,

28:37.634 --> 28:39.302
but if you don't
help him now,

28:39.719 --> 28:41.429
- Penguin and the other gangs...
- Penguin?

28:41.804 --> 28:43.181
You should've opened with that.

28:43.848 --> 28:44.974
Let's move!

28:47.894 --> 28:49.187
It's not working.

28:49.520 --> 28:51.189
We need to find a way
to cut these bindings.

28:51.356 --> 28:52.732
Well, I'm not
helping you, Jim.

28:53.399 --> 28:55.610
You are the reason
I'm in this predicament.

28:55.818 --> 28:57.612
You have taken
everything from me.

28:57.779 --> 28:58.988
Keep your voice down.

28:59.489 --> 29:02.492
I kept people safe.
I protected them from chaos.

29:02.659 --> 29:04.244
They should have loved me.

29:04.619 --> 29:06.788
Instead, they came here,
to this pigsty,

29:06.955 --> 29:08.665
to be covered
in fleas and filth.

29:08.831 --> 29:10.917
Why? What makes this place
so special?

29:11.084 --> 29:13.336
Well, for one thing,
it's far away from you.

29:13.503 --> 29:16.089
Oh, that's rich, Jim.

29:16.256 --> 29:17.632
You should be proud of yourself
for that one.

29:17.799 --> 29:19.008
(whispers):
Quiet.

29:23.680 --> 29:27.058
I think I saw someone
place a stash...

29:28.101 --> 29:29.394
there.

29:32.730 --> 29:34.440
- Who is that?
- A friend.

29:35.108 --> 29:36.734
Just act normal.

29:36.985 --> 29:38.069
I know it's a stretch.

29:47.328 --> 29:48.329
Hey.

29:51.040 --> 29:51.833
Bingo.

29:59.132 --> 30:01.009
(stifled laugh)

30:01.342 --> 30:02.427
I'm gonna get
out of here, Jim.

30:02.593 --> 30:03.761
And I'm gonna
watch these animals

30:03.928 --> 30:05.388
tear this place to the ground.

30:05.638 --> 30:07.765
So you make your way back
to your territory. Then what?

30:07.932 --> 30:09.142
Hmm? You don't think
that eventually,

30:09.309 --> 30:11.102
these gangs are gonna
come after you?

30:11.811 --> 30:13.229
We need to take them out.

30:13.813 --> 30:15.148
Right here, right now.

30:23.114 --> 30:24.657
Now, how do we pick it up?

30:48.222 --> 30:49.098
(thuds)

31:14.332 --> 31:16.959
ECCO: I'll have to have a word
with the cleaning lady.

31:17.960 --> 31:21.047
Mind your step, pilgrims.

31:24.717 --> 31:26.094
But first,

31:26.511 --> 31:28.262
the main attraction.

31:31.140 --> 31:32.600
Six-shooters.

31:33.935 --> 31:34.977
Bang,bang.

31:35.478 --> 31:37.230
Each of you get one gun.

31:37.730 --> 31:39.440
And one bullet.

31:42.443 --> 31:43.611
What is this?

31:43.986 --> 31:47.323
Like I said, a show of faith.

31:47.532 --> 31:51.411
But if you're
ch-ch-ch-chicken...

32:02.338 --> 32:03.256
(gasps)

32:04.590 --> 32:05.758
Try me.

32:29.031 --> 32:32.660
Oh, my little pilgrims.

32:33.619 --> 32:37.582
This will make
Jeremiah so happy.

32:40.293 --> 32:41.544
Now,

32:42.003 --> 32:43.921
on the count
of three.

32:45.214 --> 32:46.674
One...

32:49.093 --> 32:50.428
Two...

32:53.014 --> 32:53.723
Chicken poo.

32:57.602 --> 33:00.021
Just seeing if y'all
were listening.

33:04.233 --> 33:06.652
- Three!
- (gunshots)

33:10.406 --> 33:13.409
ECCO:
Well, well, well.

33:14.410 --> 33:16.245
You disappoint
me, curls.

33:17.371 --> 33:19.665
I had such high
hopes for you.

33:20.917 --> 33:22.210
What, with that

33:22.835 --> 33:25.588
cocky little swagger and all.

33:27.215 --> 33:28.883
I'm just not
a mindless idiot

33:29.050 --> 33:32.929
who's willing to get shot
in the head for nothing.

33:34.680 --> 33:35.932
Hear that?

33:36.766 --> 33:41.103
Curls is here to judge
all of us,

33:41.771 --> 33:45.608
to judge Jeremiah
and his methods.

33:46.817 --> 33:48.528
What a fitting reminder.

33:48.778 --> 33:50.112
To outsiders,

33:50.738 --> 33:54.033
Jeremiah's methods
may look like madness,

33:54.450 --> 33:56.285
but we believers know:

33:56.994 --> 34:01.374
his methods will be
our salvation.

34:01.707 --> 34:02.708
Now,

34:03.918 --> 34:06.379
I need to have a word
with our friend.

34:07.338 --> 34:08.714
The rest of you

34:09.297 --> 34:12.134
get straight A's.

34:12.467 --> 34:14.887
Please proceed

34:15.638 --> 34:18.056
and be reborn.

34:22.728 --> 34:24.647
(humming)

34:41.080 --> 34:44.542
- (blows landing)
- (men grunting)

34:50.590 --> 34:51.882
What's the matter?

34:52.466 --> 34:54.719
Don't you want to meet Jeremiah?

34:55.011 --> 34:56.012
I do.

34:56.971 --> 35:00.349
I'm just not willing to play
your little psychotic game.

35:00.766 --> 35:02.685
Flaughs)

35:03.102 --> 35:07.189
But, baby, it's so fun.

35:07.356 --> 35:08.941
If it's so fun,

35:09.317 --> 35:11.319
why don't <i>you</i> play?

35:12.528 --> 35:14.071
Don't you get it?

35:15.031 --> 35:16.532
I have.

35:22.288 --> 35:23.956
The bullet's
still inside.

35:24.707 --> 35:27.835
Rattling around
this old noggin of mine.

35:28.419 --> 35:31.047
Ping. Ping.

35:31.339 --> 35:32.465
Ping.

35:34.008 --> 35:37.303
Boy, do I feel it
when the nights get cold.

35:40.514 --> 35:41.349
(gun clicks)

35:43.017 --> 35:43.934
(gun clicks)

35:45.269 --> 35:46.854
- (gun clicks)
- (laughing)

35:47.730 --> 35:49.023
You're insane.

35:50.983 --> 35:52.026
No.

35:52.777 --> 35:56.155
I was willing to look
death in the face,

35:56.781 --> 35:59.742
to allow the old me to die.

36:00.451 --> 36:04.497
It's the gift Jeremiah's brother
Jerome gave him.

36:04.664 --> 36:08.376
And the gift he wants
for all his followers.

36:08.959 --> 36:12.838
Don't you want to experience
this gift for yourself?

36:13.297 --> 36:15.591
I know
I want you to.

36:17.176 --> 36:18.678
Selina.

36:19.804 --> 36:21.013
You know me.

36:21.222 --> 36:24.058
There isn't a single part
of Bruce Wayne's life

36:24.225 --> 36:25.768
that we don't know about.

36:26.185 --> 36:29.730
His joys,
his disappointments,

36:29.980 --> 36:32.400
his desires.

36:32.650 --> 36:36.654
But just like Bruce wasn't ready
to embrace his true self,

36:36.987 --> 36:40.324
looks like you
aren't either.

36:41.826 --> 36:44.161
Maybe.

36:44.829 --> 36:48.165
But one thing

36:48.332 --> 36:52.169
Jeremiah did teach me is I...

36:52.670 --> 36:54.714
(hissing):
hate

36:55.005 --> 36:58.926
having a gun pointed at my face.

36:59.719 --> 37:00.553
(gunshon

37:08.686 --> 37:11.772
Oh, puddin',
aren't you delicious.

37:17.778 --> 37:19.113
(gun clicking)

37:27.413 --> 37:30.249
Don't call me puddin'.

37:33.419 --> 37:35.171
There you go, Selina.

37:36.005 --> 37:37.757
I knew you had
it in you.

37:38.299 --> 37:39.508
All it took
was a little

37:39.675 --> 37:41.177
kick in the pants.

37:41.343 --> 37:42.428
Where's Jeremiah?

37:43.179 --> 37:44.430
Selina, drop the gun.

37:44.597 --> 37:47.683
Oh-oh, your boyfriend's worried.

37:48.100 --> 37:51.228
But I still don't think
you have what it takes.

37:51.395 --> 37:55.691
Yeah? Well, let's see what
happens when someone deserves

37:55.858 --> 37:57.276
to get shot in the head.

37:57.443 --> 37:58.611
Selina, stop!

38:00.279 --> 38:01.489
(shouts)

38:07.411 --> 38:08.496
(shouts)

38:10.456 --> 38:11.582
(screams)

38:13.209 --> 38:13.876
Wait.

38:14.043 --> 38:14.919
You're bleeding.

38:15.085 --> 38:16.462
If you know what's good for you,

38:16.629 --> 38:19.131
you will let me go.

38:19.298 --> 38:21.050
We need to get
you patched up.

38:23.969 --> 38:24.762
What are you doing?

38:24.929 --> 38:27.932
I have been doing it your way.

38:29.141 --> 38:32.311
I'm gonna do it my way.

38:35.815 --> 38:36.941
Selina!

38:38.317 --> 38:39.693
Selina!

38:44.365 --> 38:45.991
LO BOYZ LEADER:
Look at those biceps. Whoa.

38:46.158 --> 38:47.451
I need him to
build barricades.

38:47.618 --> 38:48.452
Nah, homie.

38:48.619 --> 38:51.163
This guy's got cage match
written all over him.

38:51.622 --> 38:53.082
I'll give you two of mine
in exchange.

38:53.249 --> 38:54.416
How about this.

38:56.627 --> 38:58.671
Drop your guns,
and I won't shoot you.

38:59.004 --> 39:00.047
How the hell did he get free?

39:00.214 --> 39:02.216
Don't matter.
He's bluffing again.

39:02.383 --> 39:03.926
OSWALD:
I'm afraid he's not.

39:04.802 --> 39:05.761
Neither am I.

39:07.596 --> 39:09.014
Come on out, boys.

39:22.236 --> 39:24.780
Yes, Edward,
I killed the bad men.

39:25.948 --> 39:27.658
Penguin shot
the gang leader.

39:27.825 --> 39:31.078
(indistinct chatter)

39:31.245 --> 39:35.416
REFUGEES (chanting):
Penguin! Penguin! Penguin!

39:35.666 --> 39:39.587
Penguin! Penguin! Penguin!

39:39.753 --> 39:41.881
Penguin! Penguin!

39:42.047 --> 39:44.466
(chanting continues)

39:54.852 --> 39:56.270
You'd said we'd be safe here.

39:56.437 --> 39:57.938
We were better off
where we came from.

39:58.147 --> 39:59.773
Give it a rest, he saved us!

39:59.940 --> 40:01.775
(overlapping chatter)

40:01.942 --> 40:03.193
All right, listen up.

40:03.652 --> 40:04.945
- Listen to me.
- For what?

40:05.112 --> 40:06.447
Listen to me!

40:07.781 --> 40:09.867
I know today was a hard day.

40:10.910 --> 40:12.620
And I can't say
there won't be others.

40:13.787 --> 40:14.997
But we won.

40:15.998 --> 40:18.542
We got Penguin's guns,
his ammunition.

40:19.668 --> 40:21.086
We survived.

40:22.504 --> 40:23.756
And as long as we survive,

40:23.923 --> 40:26.300
hope survives in Gotham.

40:27.927 --> 40:29.845
I think that's
worth fighting for.

40:31.388 --> 40:32.723
So do I.

40:41.190 --> 40:42.650
There's work to be done,

40:44.944 --> 40:46.528
wounded to be cared for,

40:48.572 --> 40:50.991
food, water to be doled out.

40:52.826 --> 40:54.286
Tomorrow's another day.

40:54.954 --> 40:55.996
Go to.

41:00.334 --> 41:03.128
Captain, we've got
Penguin outside.

41:03.879 --> 41:05.214
All right, give me a minute.

41:08.467 --> 41:09.510
Hey.

41:10.803 --> 41:12.638
That was a brave
thing you did there.

41:13.305 --> 41:14.765
We wouldn't have escaped
without you.

41:15.391 --> 41:18.644
You saved me and my friends.

41:19.436 --> 41:20.604
I wanted to help.

41:22.064 --> 41:23.941
I can't be everywhere at once.

41:24.900 --> 41:27.403
I'm gonna need people I can
trust watching over this place.

41:28.112 --> 41:29.238
Maybe...

41:32.157 --> 41:34.576
you could be my deputy
here in Haven.

41:36.578 --> 41:37.871
WILL:
Thanks.

41:38.038 --> 41:41.625
Because, honestly,
I'm allergic to pineapple.

41:42.167 --> 41:43.544
Go get 'em, Deputy.

41:51.927 --> 41:55.347
Jim, is this really necessary?

41:55.514 --> 41:58.851
I did just save, I don't know,
hundreds of people.

41:59.018 --> 42:01.270
After endangering
them to begin with.

42:01.937 --> 42:03.939
Forgive me if I wanted
to play it safe.

42:04.023 --> 42:07.234
Still, I do hope that there
are no hard feelings.

42:07.943 --> 42:10.070
You did the right
thing today, Oswald.

42:10.237 --> 42:12.948
You're free to go,
just don't make me regret it.

42:14.324 --> 42:15.284
Jim!

42:16.910 --> 42:18.037
Harvey.

42:18.412 --> 42:19.788
_ Hi!
<i>'</i> Jim!

42:19.955 --> 42:21.457
- GORDON: Hold your fire.
- Bye, Pengy.

42:21.623 --> 42:24.209
- Barbara, no. No.
- Get out of the way! Now!

42:24.501 --> 42:26.920
Outside of the Green Zone,
he's fair game, but not here.

42:27.087 --> 42:27.838
Last chance.

42:28.005 --> 42:30.174
Move now or you get
my first bullet.

42:31.425 --> 42:32.384
I'm not moving.

43:00.245 --> 43:02.372
<i>IS'</i>
