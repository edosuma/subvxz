- that's for me.

16:00.417 --> 16:02.851
- no, you wait
just a minute.

16:02.917 --> 16:05.317
I want some answers,
myka.

16:05.383 --> 16:07.218
Now, first of all, who is
the man in the little tv?

16:07.283 --> 16:08.484
- his name is artie.

16:08.550 --> 16:10.084
- and is he a doctor?
- no, but--

16:10.151 --> 16:11.617
- your father belongs
in a hospital.

16:11.684 --> 16:14.684
- this isn't medical. mom,
this is something else.

16:14.751 --> 16:16.650
- and how do you know?
you're not a doctor.

16:16.717 --> 16:18.051
You protect the president.

16:18.118 --> 16:21.550
- not anymore.

16:21.617 --> 16:26.118
I'm still with the government,
but i am doing this now.

16:26.184 --> 16:30.350
- what?
what are you doing?

16:33.250 --> 16:38.084
- i'm trying to help dad, mom,
so just let me do that.

16:38.151 --> 16:42.684
Trust me.
please.

16:49.951 --> 16:51.884
- ready?
- yeah.

16:51.951 --> 16:53.784
Um, mom, just stay here.

16:53.851 --> 16:56.650
Whatever you see or hear,
just stay put.

16:56.717 --> 17:00.218
- but--
- just don't move.

17:00.283 --> 17:02.717
- do--

17:02.784 --> 17:05.184
- it'll be okay.

17:05.250 --> 17:07.751
They do this kind of stuff
all the time, so--

17:07.817 --> 17:09.584
- claudia?
- i gotta--

17:09.650 --> 17:13.250
- but what's going on?

17:13.317 --> 17:15.084
- they're really good
at this.

17:17.084 --> 17:19.282
- [groans]

17:19.349 --> 17:22.250
- here it is.

17:26.017 --> 17:27.550
- kill it.

17:29.051 --> 17:31.984
- duck and cover.

17:34.118 --> 17:36.751
- what's happening?

17:36.817 --> 17:38.417
- mom, how's dad?

17:38.484 --> 17:43.017
- um, he's the same.

17:43.084 --> 17:44.383
Why, was something
supposed to happen?

17:47.917 --> 17:50.417
- check his arms.

17:50.484 --> 17:52.118
- it's still there.

17:56.851 --> 18:00.784
- it's ink.
ink.

18:00.851 --> 18:01.684
Take it out.

18:11.118 --> 18:13.851
- now what?

18:13.917 --> 18:15.617
- the neutralizer failed

18:15.684 --> 18:17.884
Because i think we're dealing
with a bifurcated object.

18:17.951 --> 18:19.851
It's--it's got
at least two parts,

18:19.917 --> 18:22.317
And they're each dependent
on the other.

18:22.383 --> 18:27.684
And, uh, that notebook is just
one half of the package.

18:27.751 --> 18:29.084
- so what's the other half?

18:29.151 --> 18:31.151
- you know, based on
the manifestations of the ink,

18:31.218 --> 18:33.084
Then that would tell me that
it's a pen,

18:33.151 --> 18:34.917
Most like--well, a pen,
anyway.

18:34.984 --> 18:36.917
Oh, by the way,
the shipper's address?

18:36.984 --> 18:39.017
That's completely phony.

18:39.084 --> 18:41.517
- macpherson sent it,
didn't he?

18:41.584 --> 18:44.250
- [sighs]
i don't know that.

18:44.317 --> 18:45.951
- so what?
he's coming after family now?

18:46.017 --> 18:47.884
- what does he want?
- well, he wants to hurt us,

18:47.951 --> 18:50.350
Because we're going after him.
- stop, stop, stop, stop.

18:50.417 --> 18:53.450
Just stop it. we don't know
who sent it or why.

18:53.517 --> 18:56.118
If it is macpherson,
it could be revenge or mischief

18:56.184 --> 18:57.751
Or a diversion
so that we're doing this

18:57.817 --> 18:59.751
While he's doing
something else.

18:59.817 --> 19:02.484
Just in case,
just to be safe, i've, uh--

19:02.550 --> 19:07.118
I'm circling the wagons
around joshua

19:07.184 --> 19:08.317
And around pete's family.

19:08.383 --> 19:10.517
Who or why does not matter.

19:10.584 --> 19:12.617
What matters is your father
and the notebook.

19:12.684 --> 19:14.283
Now--now, listen.

19:14.350 --> 19:18.751
I've analyzed the text.
it ain't good. it's poe.

19:18.817 --> 19:22.317
Um, edgar allan poe.

19:22.383 --> 19:25.383
The reason that the book is
getting under your father's skin

19:25.450 --> 19:27.617
Is because the pen
is not with it.

19:27.684 --> 19:29.951
- so, what? we bring the pen
together with the notebook

19:30.017 --> 19:32.250
And this all stops?
- yeah.

19:32.317 --> 19:34.350
Well, probably,

19:34.417 --> 19:37.617
If it follows a typical
bifurcated artifact scenario.

19:37.684 --> 19:39.484
It can't be an accident

19:39.550 --> 19:41.517
That this book found its way
to your dad.

19:41.584 --> 19:47.684
Look, uh, myka, right now
your father is a conduit.

19:47.751 --> 19:49.851
The notebook, the pen, they're
linked through his energy,

19:49.917 --> 19:52.751
Through his love
of the written word.

19:52.817 --> 19:54.650
- so where is this pen?

19:54.717 --> 19:57.784
- well, i'm searching for
coinciding incidents right now.

19:57.851 --> 19:59.417
Uh, you know, i've got
the filters off.

19:59.484 --> 20:01.184
- but it's causing trouble
somewhere?

20:01.250 --> 20:02.650
- but i'll find it.
you'll get it.

20:02.717 --> 20:04.884
The next time he has an attack,
i'll trace the pen.

20:04.951 --> 20:06.751
You'll retrieve it and reunite
it with the notebook.

20:06.817 --> 20:08.184
- how long does he have?

20:08.250 --> 20:09.917
- i don't know what you--
how long--what?

20:09.984 --> 20:11.450
- how long does he have?

20:11.517 --> 20:14.218
Artie, my father can't
take this much longer.

20:14.283 --> 20:17.417
- um...

20:17.484 --> 20:19.517
[stutters]

20:19.584 --> 20:22.084
A day.
maybe two.

20:22.151 --> 20:24.017
But you can help him.

20:24.084 --> 20:25.717
Until i land on something,
myka,

20:25.784 --> 20:30.017
Just surround him with
his books, with his world,

20:30.084 --> 20:33.484
And read to him, myka,
read to him books that he loves

20:33.550 --> 20:36.417
And use those words to fight
what's happening to him.

20:36.484 --> 20:41.684
And just try to keep him
connected to reality if you can.

20:50.751 --> 20:52.550
- bobby's not that bad.

20:52.617 --> 20:54.917
- look, all i'm saying is,
watch out.

20:54.984 --> 20:56.317
[both laugh]

20:56.383 --> 20:59.584
Geek love. ugh!

21:04.884 --> 21:08.317
- "i might have been improved
for my whole life.

21:08.383 --> 21:11.684
"i might have been made
another creature, perhaps,

21:11.751 --> 21:16.383
For life, by a kind word,
at that season..."

21:20.984 --> 21:22.484
- do you
want me to take over?

21:22.550 --> 21:25.884
- no, no.
i'm--i'm fine.

21:28.550 --> 21:32.517
He's gonna be okay, mom.

21:32.584 --> 21:33.717
- um...

21:33.784 --> 21:35.584
Oh.

21:35.650 --> 21:37.218
I'll be back in a sec.

21:37.283 --> 21:40.484
I'm just gonna
take these dishes.

21:40.550 --> 21:42.884
- freak's probably
swiped your panties

21:42.951 --> 21:44.917
From gym class
or something.

21:44.984 --> 21:46.283
- gross!

21:48.250 --> 21:51.151
- tiger.

21:51.218 --> 21:52.250
- dad?

21:52.317 --> 21:54.917
- tiger, stop it.

21:56.317 --> 21:59.383
- fire.
- dad?

21:59.450 --> 22:00.751
- fire!

22:00.817 --> 22:02.984
[all screaming]

22:03.051 --> 22:04.017
- dad?

22:04.084 --> 22:05.317
[screaming]

22:10.018 --> 22:11.918
Help, somebody get some help.

22:20.184 --> 22:22.717
- artie's got something.
- what?

22:22.783 --> 22:25.817
- at the precise moment
your dad was shouting "fire,"

22:25.884 --> 22:27.850
A kid in portland, oregon,
was burned

22:27.917 --> 22:31.251
By some bizarre wall of flame
shooting from his locker.

22:31.317 --> 22:33.817
No one can explain it.

22:33.884 --> 22:36.117
- well, what about
the tiger thing?

22:36.184 --> 22:39.417
- kid's a football star
for the kingford tigers.

22:39.484 --> 22:41.117
- let's go.
- wait, myka.

22:41.184 --> 22:44.151
I need you to stay here.

22:44.217 --> 22:46.584
- i have to help my dad,
pete.

22:46.650 --> 22:49.451
- i know, but we've got
two artifacts.

22:49.518 --> 22:50.817
He's connected to one.

22:50.884 --> 22:52.184
I need you to stay
on the notebook.

22:52.251 --> 22:54.783
I'll take care of the pen.

22:54.850 --> 22:57.251
Myka, look at me.

23:01.084 --> 23:04.251
No one can help your dad
right now more than you can.

23:04.317 --> 23:06.317
- i can't let you
go alone.

23:06.384 --> 23:10.950
- i'll take claudia.

23:11.017 --> 23:12.917
- keep her safe.

23:12.984 --> 23:14.251
- yeah.

23:14.317 --> 23:16.417
But there's something else.

23:16.484 --> 23:19.551
- what?

23:19.618 --> 23:21.717
- i think i'm hot
for your mom.

23:28.217 --> 23:30.117
- i'll break it to dad.

23:30.184 --> 23:32.484
- okay.

23:32.551 --> 23:35.317
- i needed to speak
with you, bobby.

23:35.384 --> 23:37.484
Is, uh--
is everything okay?

23:37.551 --> 23:39.351
The poetry inspiring you?

23:39.417 --> 23:42.417
- not so much.

23:42.484 --> 23:44.184
- you know, it seems

23:44.251 --> 23:48.084
We had a little burglary here
the other day.

23:48.151 --> 23:52.084
The story is that
it was one of the pens

23:52.151 --> 23:53.618
That edgar allan poe used.

23:53.683 --> 23:58.817
- oh, he used it.

23:58.884 --> 24:00.717
Don't look at me
like that.

24:03.783 --> 24:08.884
- i noticed that you were
fascinated with the pen.

24:08.950 --> 24:10.783
- are you saying
i took it?

24:10.850 --> 24:13.217
Are you saying i took it?

24:13.284 --> 24:15.351
- i'll tell you what.

24:15.417 --> 24:17.650
I'm gonna go to the lounge
for a soda,

24:17.717 --> 24:21.317
And if the pen
should show up while i'm gone,

24:21.384 --> 24:23.683
Well, we'll just chalk it up

24:23.750 --> 24:27.850
To something strange
and mysterious.

24:27.917 --> 24:30.884
Back in a bit.

24:30.950 --> 24:35.417
- mr. ives.
mr. ives.

24:35.484 --> 24:37.618
Here.

24:43.317 --> 24:45.783
- "wall"?

24:45.850 --> 24:48.084
"wall"?
"wall" what?

24:48.151 --> 24:49.284
- you.

24:49.351 --> 24:52.551
[eerie whispering]

24:54.251 --> 24:55.351
- [screaming]

24:55.417 --> 24:57.950
- [moaning]

25:15.950 --> 25:18.984
- really?
does he like horror novels?

25:19.050 --> 25:21.451
Stephen king,
lovecraft, poe?

25:21.518 --> 25:25.017
- you're assuming the boy reads.
no, he's just a bully.

25:25.084 --> 25:27.050
Look, i mean, how big
a deal is this?

25:27.117 --> 25:29.284
I mean, this school's got
a reputation to maintain,

25:29.351 --> 25:30.950
And if it gets out

25:31.017 --> 25:33.417
That the government's
investigating a teenage prank,

25:33.484 --> 25:34.683
It'll put a lot
of parents off.

25:34.750 --> 25:36.317
- you mean donors?

25:36.384 --> 25:37.817
- why do you think
it's just a prank?

25:37.884 --> 25:39.817
- well, we're not schooling
little terrorists here.

25:39.884 --> 25:42.417
Somebody in the science class
got tired

25:42.484 --> 25:44.618
Of parmut picking on him
and gave him a hotfoot.

25:44.683 --> 25:46.417
- oh, yeah?
how's he doing?

25:46.484 --> 25:48.917
- he's fine.
uh, you want this open?

25:48.984 --> 25:53.783
- no. we'll, uh,
we'll take it from here.

25:53.850 --> 25:55.217
- you'll want to step back,
please.

25:55.284 --> 25:56.551
- why?
it's not dangerous.

25:56.618 --> 25:58.984
- please.

25:59.050 --> 26:02.551
Thank you.

26:06.451 --> 26:10.518
Okay.
you ready?

26:10.584 --> 26:11.884
- why not?

26:17.284 --> 26:20.251
- okay, we're in business.
here we go.

26:20.317 --> 26:24.084
So, uh, you had
any other incidents?

26:24.151 --> 26:25.084
- with what, fire?

26:25.151 --> 26:27.950
- well, anything strange.

26:28.017 --> 26:30.317
Say a tell-tale heart,
perhaps?

26:30.384 --> 26:32.217
- what?

26:35.551 --> 26:37.884
- there you go.
- gotta love artie.

26:37.950 --> 26:40.284
- what's that?
- you don't happen to have

26:40.351 --> 26:42.417
Edgar allan poe's pen
lying around, would you?

26:42.484 --> 26:45.584
- well, actually--
- yes?

26:45.650 --> 26:47.484
- mr. ives' classroom.

26:47.551 --> 26:49.284
He likes to collect items
from famous people.

26:49.351 --> 26:51.117
- the pen is here, then.

26:51.184 --> 26:54.417
- well, it was.
um, it got stolen.

26:57.351 --> 27:01.151
- [murmurs]

27:01.217 --> 27:04.584
- this last one
was the worst.

27:04.650 --> 27:06.451
- i know.

27:13.217 --> 27:14.917
- [murmuring]

27:21.783 --> 27:25.518
- dad?

27:25.584 --> 27:30.050
- if you'd been a boy
i'd have called you sue.

27:30.117 --> 27:31.351
- what?

27:31.417 --> 27:33.683
- johnny cash.
it's a song.

27:33.750 --> 27:36.618
<i>a boy named sue.</i>

27:36.683 --> 27:38.451
- okay.

27:38.518 --> 27:42.017
- make you tough.

27:42.084 --> 27:47.584
- well, i'm sorry
i wasn't a boy.

27:47.650 --> 27:50.317
- i'm sorry
i wasn't a father.

27:57.551 --> 27:59.484
[groans]

28:01.717 --> 28:03.650
- he has regrets.

28:09.484 --> 28:12.017
- about me?

28:12.084 --> 28:14.017
- yes.

28:14.084 --> 28:15.950
About his life.

28:16.017 --> 28:18.850
- what do you mean?

28:18.917 --> 28:20.817
- he wanted to write books.

28:20.884 --> 28:25.884
- i know. i know that
he wanted to write books.

28:25.950 --> 28:27.984
- did you know
he wrote a novel?

28:28.050 --> 28:30.417
- no.

28:30.484 --> 28:35.618
- 12 times.
over and over again.

28:35.683 --> 28:37.850
Unpublished.

28:37.917 --> 28:40.984
He loved it too much
to let it go.

28:41.050 --> 28:45.017
He was afraid.

28:45.084 --> 28:47.184
- where is it?

28:47.251 --> 28:49.717
- a long time ago,
when he finally gave up...

28:49.783 --> 28:55.451
[exhales]
he told me to burn it.

28:55.518 --> 28:58.783
He hasn't written a thing
since.

29:02.417 --> 29:03.717
- [moans]

29:11.458 --> 29:12.718
It can't be.

29:23.184 --> 29:24.650
- mr. ives?

29:24.717 --> 29:27.684
Hello?

29:27.750 --> 29:32.284
- nice place for a pen,
soaking up all that poe juice.

29:32.351 --> 29:33.650
- huh.

29:33.717 --> 29:35.151
- do you know that ravens
are actually brilliant?

29:35.217 --> 29:37.517
They've adapted to humans
like rats and cockroaches.

29:37.583 --> 29:39.051
They've figured out how to
figure us out.

29:39.117 --> 29:40.850
- shh.
- what?

29:41.984 --> 29:43.817
- shh.

29:46.351 --> 29:47.384
Hear anything?

29:47.483 --> 29:49.384
- just the beating
of my hideous--

29:49.450 --> 29:50.717
- stop it.
- okay.

29:54.817 --> 29:55.784
- listen.

29:55.850 --> 29:58.684
[faint scratching]

30:05.817 --> 30:07.051
What is that?

30:07.117 --> 30:08.884
- a rat in the wall?

30:10.850 --> 30:12.917
- short story.
- guy walled up.

30:12.984 --> 30:16.650
<i>- the cask...
- ...of amontillado.</i>

30:16.717 --> 30:18.384
- here, take if off there.
- i don't--

30:18.450 --> 30:19.650
I don't want avian flu!
- take it!

30:19.717 --> 30:23.051
- all right!

30:23.117 --> 30:25.917

30:38.017 --> 30:40.051
- [coughs]

30:40.117 --> 30:41.184
- mr. ives?

30:41.251 --> 30:43.217
- [coughs]

30:43.284 --> 30:46.418
- [grunting]

30:49.151 --> 30:50.750
Who did this to you?

30:50.817 --> 30:53.517
- [coughs]
bobby.

30:53.583 --> 30:56.117
[coughs]
find him. stop him.

31:02.517 --> 31:05.351
[creaking]

31:19.650 --> 31:23.717
- bobby, not cool.

31:23.784 --> 31:25.750
- myka, something's wrong.

31:25.817 --> 31:27.750
- artie, i need help.

31:27.817 --> 31:30.351
- what's this?

31:30.418 --> 31:34.251
- a poem.
i wrote it for you.

31:34.318 --> 31:35.550
- i gotta go.

31:38.384 --> 31:39.318
- [groans]

31:39.384 --> 31:40.917
- we're losing him.

31:40.984 --> 31:43.017
- myka, just read to him.

31:43.084 --> 31:45.084
- read it.

31:45.151 --> 31:47.151
- i have read. i've read him
everything, okay?

31:47.217 --> 31:49.717
It's not working.

31:51.850 --> 31:53.517
- [anguished cry]

31:53.583 --> 31:55.884
- you have to find the words
that he loves.

31:55.951 --> 31:58.750
You have to find a book
that means more to him

31:58.817 --> 32:02.384
Than--than anything
in the world.

32:02.450 --> 32:04.251
- mom, tell me
you didn't burn it.

32:04.318 --> 32:06.384
- what?
- dad's book.

32:06.450 --> 32:09.750
- aunt cindy's bureau.
the bottom drawer.

32:11.483 --> 32:12.750
- okay,
so ives said that--

32:12.817 --> 32:15.117
That bobby had a crush
on what--what's her name?

32:15.184 --> 32:16.650
- tamara.
- tamara, right.

32:16.717 --> 32:18.184
There's always a girl.

32:18.251 --> 32:20.418
- don't blame her.
blame testosterone.

32:20.483 --> 32:22.318
Crazy, crazy man hormone.

32:22.384 --> 32:26.617
- i'm not blaming the girl.
i'm blaming poe.

32:26.684 --> 32:28.517
Bobby?

32:30.517 --> 32:33.784
- crazy,
scary man hormone.

32:36.817 --> 32:39.850
- check out
miss teenage zombie.

32:39.917 --> 32:41.850
Oh, right.

32:41.917 --> 32:43.550
Uh...
[clears throat]

32:43.617 --> 32:48.583
Bobby...and...

32:48.650 --> 32:50.784
- tamara.

32:50.850 --> 32:52.318
- tamara, was it?
right?

32:52.384 --> 32:54.217
[clears throat]

32:54.284 --> 32:56.450
That's a nice pen,
bobby.

32:56.517 --> 32:59.917
Why don't you give it up,
huh?

32:59.984 --> 33:02.617
Come on, give it here.

33:05.051 --> 33:07.550
- "pendulum"?

33:15.483 --> 33:18.217
- you've gotta be kidding me.

33:18.284 --> 33:19.251
- [gasps]

33:23.184 --> 33:25.017
- bobby!

33:31.617 --> 33:33.251
- i got it.

33:35.750 --> 33:37.750
- bobby, you've got to
stop this.

33:37.817 --> 33:39.217
I know,
you're all full of poe,

33:39.284 --> 33:41.817
Up to your creepy eyeballs
in "nevermore" and crap, but--

33:41.884 --> 33:44.450
- but--but--but
this isn't fiction!

33:44.517 --> 33:46.017
It's real!

33:46.084 --> 33:49.717
- it's the most real i have
ever felt in my entire life.

33:49.784 --> 33:52.017
<i>- the blue willow sky
by warren bering.</i>

33:52.084 --> 33:53.650
Chapter one.

33:53.717 --> 33:55.784
"when the girl was born,
his first thought was fear."

33:58.051 --> 33:59.884
- it's beautiful.

33:59.951 --> 34:01.550
- bobby, you're a good person,
but you're--

34:01.617 --> 34:03.583
You're hurting people!

34:03.650 --> 34:05.017
You're hurting yourself
and you're hurting tamara,

34:05.084 --> 34:06.384
And it has to stop!

34:06.450 --> 34:09.318
- people like you
don't see me.

34:09.384 --> 34:11.217
You don't believe in me.

34:11.284 --> 34:13.951
People like you need to be
shocked into seeing.

34:14.016 --> 34:17.184
You need to be horrified.
then you'll understand.

34:17.251 --> 34:19.684
- understand what, bobby?
tell me what!

34:19.750 --> 34:22.217
- that words have power.

34:22.284 --> 34:25.449
- "...for her.
for his daughter.

34:25.516 --> 34:27.150
She was his life."

34:27.217 --> 34:29.684
[echoing]
- but this isn't fiction!

34:29.750 --> 34:31.051
It's real!

34:31.117 --> 34:32.516
- "she was his life.

34:32.583 --> 34:35.784
His only job now
was keeping her safe."

34:35.850 --> 34:37.717
- [moaning]

34:42.449 --> 34:46.318
- "she was his life."

34:46.384 --> 34:48.550
- it's working, myka.

34:48.617 --> 34:51.418
[echoing]
- words have power.

35:02.750 --> 35:04.184
- something's happening.

35:09.384 --> 35:13.517
Go, go, claudia!
get the pen!

35:26.583 --> 35:28.184
- who are you? what?

35:28.251 --> 35:30.517
- one second. nice, claud.
- here's the bag.

35:30.583 --> 35:32.284
- get him to a hospital.
this still has a hold on him!

35:32.285 --> 35:33.685
And Micah's dad.

35:41.517 --> 35:44.450
- myka! i got it. hey.
- hey.

35:44.517 --> 35:45.550
- how is he?

35:45.617 --> 35:46.650
- is that it?
- that's it.

35:46.717 --> 35:47.984
- well, he--he's not worse,

35:48.051 --> 35:50.417
But he's not better.
not--not completely.

35:50.483 --> 35:52.884
- his strength
is the only thing

35:52.951 --> 35:55.084
That's keeping that pen from
flipping completely out.

35:55.151 --> 35:57.817
- okay, the notebook's
in place.

35:57.884 --> 35:59.584
- good. take the pen,
keep it in the bag,

35:59.650 --> 36:02.884
And just, you know,
approach the notebook.

36:02.951 --> 36:05.084
- i'm on it.
- be careful!

36:05.151 --> 36:07.951
- i am! would you stop
yelling at me?

36:08.017 --> 36:10.617
Somebody turn down his volume
or something.

36:10.684 --> 36:12.450
- okay. now what?

36:12.517 --> 36:14.650
- you know, put the bag
right over the notebook,

36:14.717 --> 36:16.218
Turn it upside down,
dump the pen out,

36:16.284 --> 36:18.450
Make sure it lands on the
notebook and stays there.

36:18.517 --> 36:20.251
- that's it?
just dump it out?

36:20.318 --> 36:22.617
- yeah.
- just lay it on the notebook?

36:22.684 --> 36:24.051
- yeah.
this isn't cirque du soleil!

36:24.117 --> 36:25.684
Just dump the pen on the book
and stand back!

36:25.750 --> 36:26.884
- all right!

36:34.717 --> 36:36.517
- artie,
nothing's happening.

36:36.584 --> 36:39.251
- uh, that's--that's okay.
it's all right, it's fine.

36:39.318 --> 36:41.517
It's been a while
since they've been together.

36:41.584 --> 36:44.917
Probably they're just
getting reacquainted.

36:44.984 --> 36:48.151
[electrical buzzing]

36:48.218 --> 36:49.884
- wait, wait.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

36:56.951 --> 36:58.750

37:16.984 --> 37:18.851
[exhales]

37:22.483 --> 37:23.483
What's this?

37:25.318 --> 37:27.350
- [gasps]

37:27.417 --> 37:28.517
Hi.

37:28.584 --> 37:30.017

37:30.084 --> 37:33.151
- um, sort of.

37:33.218 --> 37:37.517
- i was dreaming
you were reading and...

37:46.750 --> 37:47.951
You didn't burn it?

37:48.017 --> 37:50.617
- no.

37:54.717 --> 37:56.617
[laughter]

37:56.684 --> 37:58.184
- i-i did.

37:58.251 --> 37:59.584
- [laughs]

37:59.650 --> 38:03.851
- okay, well, um,
i think i've got everything.

38:03.917 --> 38:06.284
- honey?
- yeah.

38:06.350 --> 38:08.684
Hey, i don't know what it is
you do for a living,

38:08.750 --> 38:12.784
But you do it very well,
and i mean that.

38:18.584 --> 38:21.151
I'll see you soon,
and we'll--we'll talk.

38:23.184 --> 38:25.817
We'll talk about something
other than books.

38:30.750 --> 38:31.917
- oh, mom.

38:31.984 --> 38:35.084
- good-bye, honey.
thank you so much.

38:35.151 --> 38:38.817
And, um,
you take care of pete.

38:38.884 --> 38:42.251
- i always do.

38:50.151 --> 38:52.517
- hello.
- hello.

38:54.051 --> 38:58.917
- got everything?

38:58.984 --> 39:02.617
- called the cab? n--

39:02.684 --> 39:04.984
- no, no. no, i didn't.
- oh.

39:05.051 --> 39:10.218
- i think, mr. poe,
that when your things arrive,

39:10.284 --> 39:14.650
We'll stick them in--yeah.
the madrid section.

39:14.717 --> 39:16.450
That is if leena agrees.

39:16.517 --> 39:19.951
- arthur?

39:20.017 --> 39:22.750
Pete and myka
are in colorado springs.

39:22.817 --> 39:24.784
- yeah, i know.
i should have tried--

39:24.851 --> 39:26.151
- and so is macpherson.

39:26.218 --> 39:27.717
[computer beeps]

39:27.784 --> 39:31.984
- what?
how did he--

39:32.051 --> 39:34.218
He was there
the whole time?

39:34.284 --> 39:36.951
- he had us all distracted.

39:37.017 --> 39:41.184
I think that was
macpherson's intent.

39:41.251 --> 39:42.151
[farnsworth buzzing]

39:42.218 --> 39:45.984
- ooh.

39:46.051 --> 39:47.584
I'll take the farnsworth.
- good choice.

39:47.650 --> 39:51.784
- mm-hmm.

39:51.851 --> 39:53.650
Hey, artie,
we're heading home.

39:53.717 --> 39:56.483
- myka! myka, listen!
myka!

39:57.984 --> 39:59.817
- that was weird.

39:59.884 --> 40:03.784
- hold on.
- vibe?

40:03.851 --> 40:05.717
- huge.
your dad.

40:05.784 --> 40:08.417
- what?

40:09.984 --> 40:13.218
Is this poe? are we back
into the poe thing again?

40:13.284 --> 40:15.851
- i don't know.

40:38.817 --> 40:41.817
- you two are good.

40:41.884 --> 40:44.184
I see why mrs. frederic
drafted you.

40:48.084 --> 40:53.650
- ah-ah! i kill this, and it's
lights out for mom and dad.

40:53.717 --> 40:54.984
- you hurt my father.

40:55.051 --> 40:56.350
- he glimpsed the mind

40:56.417 --> 40:57.517
Of one of the greatest authors
in the world.

40:57.584 --> 40:58.951
He'll thank me later.

40:59.017 --> 41:01.951
- oh, you'll be dead later.
- what do you want?

41:02.017 --> 41:05.184
- i want what you risked
your lives to get.

41:05.251 --> 41:09.817
I would have done it myself,
but i lacked the means.

41:11.884 --> 41:13.584
You have
until the count of one.

41:13.650 --> 41:15.483
- you came after family.

41:15.550 --> 41:16.851
- arthur started it.

41:16.917 --> 41:18.383
- what is that
supposed to mean?

41:18.450 --> 41:20.851
- ask him.

41:25.984 --> 41:27.350
- pete.

41:35.784 --> 41:37.483
Now let them go.

41:44.051 --> 41:45.017
Do it!

41:49.650 --> 41:50.984
- thank you.

41:51.051 --> 41:54.717
- consider it a loan.

41:58.617 --> 42:01.517
- [gasps]

42:01.584 --> 42:02.951
- what the hell was that?

42:03.017 --> 42:05.184
- jack the ripper's
lantern.

42:05.251 --> 42:08.383
- at least we know
where that is now.

42:15.151 --> 42:19.550
- he used us
from the very beginning.

42:19.617 --> 42:23.684
- no. he used me.
