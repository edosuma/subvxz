WEBVTT

00:05.820 --> 00:07.549
- What's going on?
- Where's Hetty?

00:07.721 --> 00:08.917
She asked me to brief you.

00:09.090 --> 00:10.854
Have you heard from Deeks?

00:11.025 --> 00:12.186
No.

00:13.161 --> 00:14.322
What's up?

00:14.495 --> 00:16.623
Besides us at 3:30 in the morning.

00:16.798 --> 00:19.597
We're going tactical now.
I'll brief you in the armory. Let's go.

00:19.767 --> 00:21.098
Wait a minute. Where is Hetty?

00:21.269 --> 00:23.260
Please stop asking me that.

00:23.438 --> 00:25.429
Then brief us.

00:26.975 --> 00:30.775
As of 72 hours ago, Special Agent Blye
disappeared into the mountains

00:30.945 --> 00:32.537
east of Khost, Afghanistan.

00:32.714 --> 00:34.910
Whoa, hold, wait.
What do you mean disappeared?

00:37.819 --> 00:39.048
There is a strong likelihood

00:39.220 --> 00:41.587
she's being held by a group
of Taliban fighters

00:41.756 --> 00:45.317
believed responsible for attacking
U.S. Military out of Camp Chapman.

00:45.493 --> 00:47.359
- Why isn't Hetty here?
- Deeks.

00:47.528 --> 00:51.590
Assistant Director Owen Granger went
searching for the group 72 hours ago.

00:51.766 --> 00:52.824
Twelve hours ago,

00:53.001 --> 00:56.596
both the CIA and U.S. Military
lost all contact with him.

00:56.771 --> 01:01.038
You will be briefed on all available intel
upon your arrival at Camp Chapman.

01:01.209 --> 01:02.472
We're going to Afghanistan?

01:02.644 --> 01:05.203
The mission is to locate and rescue
Agent Blye.

01:05.379 --> 01:06.404
I wanna talk to Hetty.

01:06.581 --> 01:08.777
Transport is waiting at LAX.
Wheels are up in 20.

01:08.950 --> 01:12.079
Grab your weapons
and your go-bags.

01:12.253 --> 01:13.584
Quickly.

01:14.689 --> 01:17.124
Okay, let's move.

01:45.987 --> 01:47.819
Gentlemen?

01:54.962 --> 01:57.624
Don't forget
your most important weapon.

01:57.799 --> 02:00.666
There's a half a million dollars
in each case.

02:01.135 --> 02:04.571
It was the most I could get
given the short notice.

02:04.739 --> 02:06.901
Use it to buy information.

02:07.075 --> 02:10.101
Put a bounty on their heads.
Whatever it takes.

02:10.277 --> 02:12.212
- Hetty...
- You're saving a team member,

02:12.380 --> 02:14.348
time is of the essence.

02:15.750 --> 02:18.412
I need to speak with Mr. Hanna
for a moment.

02:18.586 --> 02:20.020
Would you take these cases?

02:30.832 --> 02:33.164
Mr. Deeks is emotionally involved.

02:33.835 --> 02:35.234
We all are.

02:35.403 --> 02:39.203
Yes, but I'm sure you'll agree
his is a different circumstance.

02:39.374 --> 02:41.001
He's also not a soldier.

02:41.175 --> 02:43.041
Let alone a Navy SEAL.

02:43.211 --> 02:44.508
You want me to watch his back.

02:44.679 --> 02:46.113
Quite the opposite.

02:46.280 --> 02:50.877
I want you to single-mindedly remain
focused on Agent Blye.

02:51.185 --> 02:55.144
If you need to separate Mr. Deeks
from the team, do so.

02:55.323 --> 02:56.347
I understand.

02:57.792 --> 03:00.022
I need you to bring her home, Sam.

03:00.495 --> 03:02.054
I will.

03:36.497 --> 03:40.127
I love the sunset in winter
from the Santa Monica Pier.

03:44.372 --> 03:46.739
My father used to take me
on Christmas evening to see it.

03:46.908 --> 03:47.932
Agent Callen.

03:48.109 --> 03:49.133
Who are you?

03:49.310 --> 03:51.472
Sergeant Makar,
ANA Special Forces.

03:51.646 --> 03:55.605
You're to speak to no one on base.
No CIA, no military intelligence.

03:55.783 --> 03:57.503
Under whose authority
are you addressing us?

03:57.652 --> 03:59.484
- Owen Granger.
- You know where he is?

03:59.654 --> 04:01.247
You have to change
out of these clothes.

04:01.422 --> 04:02.548
Come with me. Quickly.

04:02.723 --> 04:04.191
We're supposed to be briefed.

04:04.358 --> 04:07.123
Now you're telling me I can't even
speak to an intelligence officer?

04:07.295 --> 04:08.763
What the hell's going on?

04:10.198 --> 04:12.132
Welcome to Afghanistan, gentlemen.

04:23.478 --> 04:25.845
- So now what?
- Wait here.

04:34.856 --> 04:36.187
We may have been set up.

04:42.964 --> 04:44.432
It's Granger.

04:52.306 --> 04:53.865
I thought you were lost in the desert.

04:54.041 --> 04:56.271
Does anybody besides Sergeant Makar
know you're here?

04:56.444 --> 04:58.879
No. Why weren't we briefed?

05:00.414 --> 05:02.542
I tracked a Taliban courier
from the mountains

05:02.717 --> 05:04.549
east of here
to that house across the street.

05:05.520 --> 05:06.544
My assets say

05:06.721 --> 05:09.713
the courier's affiliated with the group
that's holding Agent Blye.

05:09.891 --> 05:11.450
- Who lives there?
- No idea.

05:11.626 --> 05:13.219
That doesn't answer my question.

05:14.729 --> 05:17.391
Do you remember
CIA Agent Sabatino?

05:17.965 --> 05:19.490
He and I were part of a task force

05:19.667 --> 05:21.328
targeting a man
called the White Ghost.

05:21.502 --> 05:24.369
Yeah. I read the intelligence reports.

05:24.539 --> 05:26.405
He's a Westerner aiding the Taliban.

05:26.574 --> 05:27.700
That was the story.

05:28.175 --> 05:30.200
A lot of the intel
turned out to be falsified.

05:30.378 --> 05:33.973
I suspect the CIA has other reasons
for wanting the White Ghost dead.

05:34.148 --> 05:35.707
Does Sabatino still want him dead?

05:35.883 --> 05:37.715
I don't know.
He disappeared three days ago.

05:37.885 --> 05:39.546
What does this have to do
with Kensi?

05:39.720 --> 05:42.212
Hetty had Blye brought in
to be the shooter.

05:42.924 --> 05:45.222
She acquired the target,
and she missed.

05:46.127 --> 05:47.424
You think it was intentional?

05:47.595 --> 05:49.495
I know when I'm being played,
Agent Callen.

05:49.664 --> 05:53.066
Until I figure out what's going on,
this mission is dark.

05:53.801 --> 05:55.394
As in black as night.

05:56.370 --> 05:57.701
We're on our own out here.

06:01.142 --> 06:02.610
- Is that the courier?
- Yeah.

06:02.777 --> 06:05.542
I got to stay with him,
follow him back to the rat's nest.

06:05.713 --> 06:07.873
Deeks, you stay here,
find out who lives in that house.

06:08.015 --> 06:09.895
What are you talking about?
I'm coming with you.

06:10.051 --> 06:11.644
That's a direct order.

06:13.020 --> 06:14.510
Leave him with a translator.

06:21.729 --> 06:23.424
Stay with him.
See who's in the house.

06:23.965 --> 06:25.330
Okay.

06:26.434 --> 06:28.027
He's moving.

06:51.058 --> 06:53.425
- You need to tell him to stop moving.
- I did.

07:00.201 --> 07:01.498
Don't shoot. He's blind.

07:31.731 --> 07:34.860
- Looks like he's going off-road.
- Terrains too rough for a truck.

07:35.301 --> 07:37.099
Oh, we can't keep up
with a camel on foot.

07:37.703 --> 07:40.536
Granger's gonna need
to get you a horse, cowboy.

07:40.940 --> 07:43.068
I hate horses.

07:44.610 --> 07:46.840
I just received an e-mail.

07:47.780 --> 07:48.941
From Kensi.

07:49.115 --> 07:51.015
- It's a video file.
- Play it.

07:55.188 --> 07:57.555
I was asked to kill a man
named Jack Simon.

07:57.924 --> 08:00.689
I knew Jack Simon a long time ago.

08:01.894 --> 08:03.293
He's a profoundly good man.

08:03.463 --> 08:06.194
And now he's being hunted
by the CIA.

08:06.365 --> 08:10.893
So I'm headed to the desert
east of Khost

08:11.070 --> 08:13.562
to find out what the hell
is going on.

08:13.906 --> 08:17.308
This is being sent automatically
with a time delay.

08:17.477 --> 08:21.744
So if you're seeing it, it's not good.

08:22.115 --> 08:24.584
It was an honor and my pleasure
to work with all of you.

08:26.385 --> 08:27.910
Wouldn't change a second of it.

08:33.126 --> 08:35.424
Find out everything you can
about Jack Simon.

08:38.063 --> 08:41.056
Please tell him again
that we're not here to hurt him.

08:41.433 --> 08:43.960
With all due respect,
we just wanna know his name.

08:44.136 --> 08:47.664
I think his name
is Mullah Fazlur Muhammad.

08:48.841 --> 08:49.933
He's a cleric.

08:51.043 --> 08:53.034
Has a wife.

08:53.212 --> 08:54.270
Maybe a son.

09:00.086 --> 09:01.850
Mullah Muhammad.

09:02.788 --> 09:04.517
You're married, yes? You have a wife?

09:09.829 --> 09:12.423
"No. My wife has died."

09:14.534 --> 09:15.660
I'm sorry.

09:17.036 --> 09:19.130
I have someone
that I care about very much.

09:20.606 --> 09:22.446
I'm here looking for information
regarding her.

09:24.777 --> 09:27.041
She was here
delivering humanitarian aid

09:27.213 --> 09:30.308
and we believe the Taliban
has mistakenly taken her.

09:37.156 --> 09:38.555
You're a man of God, yes?

09:39.525 --> 09:41.653
My friend is a good Muslim
and a good person.

09:51.704 --> 09:53.832
"She's unclean now,

09:54.473 --> 09:55.838
like a rat.”

10:01.881 --> 10:03.315
I don't believe that.

10:08.721 --> 10:10.985
"Your women don't cover themselves.

10:11.157 --> 10:12.716
They do not obey."

10:18.864 --> 10:20.423
I want my friend back very much.

10:23.436 --> 10:26.428
And I'm willing to pay
a great deal of money.

10:42.521 --> 10:45.115
His neighbor's daughter
didn't want to marry.

10:45.291 --> 10:47.225
And ran away.

10:48.894 --> 10:51.556
So they cut off her ears and nose

10:51.731 --> 10:53.893
to show the women in town to obey.

10:55.668 --> 10:56.931
Understand?

10:57.937 --> 10:59.098
Yeah, I understand.

11:06.145 --> 11:07.579
You're going to torture him?

11:09.115 --> 11:11.607
- I don't do that.
- You have morals?

11:12.485 --> 11:14.715
What, you don't think Americans
have morals?

11:14.887 --> 11:17.151
I've seen what man is capable of.

11:17.523 --> 11:19.753
All men, from all sides.

11:19.925 --> 11:21.689
Well, I hear you, brother.

11:21.861 --> 11:25.820
And with all due respect, I just wanna
find my partner and go home.

11:27.099 --> 11:29.033
And for the record,

11:30.403 --> 11:31.598
I have morals.

11:32.271 --> 11:34.239
Maybe in California.

11:34.407 --> 11:36.239
But it is different here.

11:36.842 --> 11:39.277
Being in this war changes a man.

11:39.445 --> 11:40.810
And not for the good.

11:42.548 --> 11:43.947
So tell me then,

11:44.116 --> 11:47.848
what kind of magic trick are you
going to use to get this man of God

11:48.020 --> 11:49.818
to give up his secrets?

11:54.627 --> 11:56.789
Jack Simon is a former Marine.

11:56.962 --> 11:58.794
He left the Corps due to PTSD

11:58.964 --> 12:00.955
and resurfaced
six years ago in Afghanistan

12:01.133 --> 12:02.965
working as a military contractor.

12:03.135 --> 12:06.127
Now, digging deeper, we found
that Jack was also working for...

12:06.305 --> 12:08.330
The CIA.

12:10.009 --> 12:12.740
Jack and I were friends.

12:14.046 --> 12:16.777
He fell in love
with an Afghan woman.

12:16.949 --> 12:19.179
Had a child, a daughter.

12:19.352 --> 12:22.617
Well, according to this,
Jack's wife was killed in a drone strike.

12:22.788 --> 12:26.986
They used his vulnerability
to coerce information from him.

12:27.159 --> 12:29.457
They forced him
to become an asset.

12:29.628 --> 12:33.565
So why did the CIA make up
the story about the White Ghost?

12:33.733 --> 12:36.361
To give validity to his execution.

12:37.436 --> 12:40.804
He knew they were coming for him.
He'd asked me for help.

12:41.307 --> 12:44.242
And I sent Kensi...

12:45.911 --> 12:48.505
to be his executioner.

12:50.416 --> 12:53.852
Bring up a file called "Jack's Ghost."

12:59.125 --> 13:01.890
They were engaged, 10 years ago.

13:02.061 --> 13:05.361
So you knew if Kensi was the shooter,
she'd never take the shot.

13:05.531 --> 13:07.363
I was trying to protect a friend.

13:08.367 --> 13:14.898
Trying to give him a running start
from the wolves.

13:16.108 --> 13:21.171
But just not at Kensi's expense.

13:22.114 --> 13:24.776
Hetty, don't blame yourself.

13:25.751 --> 13:29.085
That's just impossible, Miss Jones.

13:30.689 --> 13:32.919
It's all my doing.

13:37.863 --> 13:39.422
Hold up, there.

13:51.076 --> 13:53.044
Courier went through the mountains.

13:53.212 --> 13:54.475
Too steep for horses.

13:55.915 --> 13:58.441
A lot more men came through here.

13:59.051 --> 14:00.075
At least a dozen.

14:00.252 --> 14:01.777
Water's completely gone.

14:01.954 --> 14:04.821
We ride any further,
and we'll kill the horses.

14:04.990 --> 14:07.789
All right, take the horses,
bring back supplies and more men.

14:07.960 --> 14:09.894
As many as you can get discreetly.

14:10.062 --> 14:12.622
We'll head into the mountains on foot.

14:13.666 --> 14:17.660
You know, with no water,
there's no walking out of here now.

14:18.137 --> 14:20.572
We're all aware of the situation.

14:36.489 --> 14:38.218
MRE.

14:38.390 --> 14:39.448
We're close.

14:49.068 --> 14:50.467
That's the rat's nest.

14:51.136 --> 14:52.535
Let's take it.

15:35.447 --> 15:36.573
Clear.

15:41.253 --> 15:44.314
The courier kept moving,
probably towards Pakistan.

15:44.490 --> 15:45.582
Sam.

15:46.659 --> 15:47.683
Blood.

15:53.299 --> 15:54.425
I'll type it.

15:57.503 --> 16:00.234
Tracking U.S. troop movements.

16:02.107 --> 16:04.474
There's a latrine area outside.
It's fresh.

16:04.643 --> 16:07.112
From the size,
I estimate at least 20 men.

16:08.047 --> 16:11.540
Same blood type as Kensi, B-positive.

16:13.085 --> 16:16.248
Nine percent of the population
is B-positive.

16:16.422 --> 16:17.583
Doesn't mean anything.

16:46.885 --> 16:48.683
You know this guy?

16:53.492 --> 16:54.550
No.

17:08.574 --> 17:10.508
I'm not buying it.

17:12.044 --> 17:13.102
Not buying it...

17:16.882 --> 17:19.282
or are you not accepting it?

17:33.831 --> 17:36.061
Can we take down
this photo of her, please?

17:36.400 --> 17:37.697
No.

17:37.868 --> 17:42.362
Study it, tear it apart.
I want to know if it's real.

17:42.940 --> 17:44.032
Yeah.

17:45.409 --> 17:46.877
Line's open.

17:47.044 --> 17:49.423
I should've been made aware
of your relationship with Jack Simon,

17:49.447 --> 17:52.314
and not as the assistant director,
but personally.

17:52.483 --> 17:53.973
You owed me the truth on this.

17:54.151 --> 17:55.710
Owed you the truth?

17:56.053 --> 17:58.886
That's a debt
you've not paid me tenfold, Owen.

17:59.056 --> 18:00.683
Not in a situation like this.

18:00.858 --> 18:04.385
You were part of the team
sent to kill Jack Simon.

18:04.562 --> 18:06.621
Maybe he still is.

18:07.098 --> 18:08.122
Shouldn't we know that?

18:08.299 --> 18:11.291
I don't answer to you, Agent Callen.
You answer to me.

18:15.072 --> 18:17.234
We're deep in the field,
assistant director.

18:17.975 --> 18:19.033
What are you saying?

18:20.478 --> 18:22.071
What I'm saying...

18:22.246 --> 18:23.771
Is we stay on mission.

18:23.948 --> 18:25.507
I don't buy the photos.

18:25.683 --> 18:27.583
I can't find any evidence
of Photoshopping.

18:27.751 --> 18:30.948
I don't care. If they know Kensi and
Jack Simon are intelligence assets,

18:31.522 --> 18:33.854
they could have left the photo
to discourage us

18:34.024 --> 18:35.544
from crossing the border
into Pakistan.

18:35.693 --> 18:37.092
We keep tracking the courier.

18:37.261 --> 18:40.094
There's something else
that you should be aware of.

18:41.031 --> 18:42.692
Uh, piecing together intel,

18:42.867 --> 18:45.302
I've discovered what I believe
is a CIA team

18:45.469 --> 18:46.994
seven miles to the north of you.

18:47.171 --> 18:49.503
And they've accessed intel
on Jack Simon.

18:49.673 --> 18:51.505
They're hunting him.

18:53.410 --> 18:54.935
Our comm's almost done.

18:55.112 --> 18:57.206
This'll be our last communication
for a while.

18:57.381 --> 18:58.849
You can still track us by GPS.

18:59.383 --> 19:01.613
Then Godspeed.

19:02.186 --> 19:03.347
To all of you.

19:04.788 --> 19:06.313
We'll see you on the other side.

19:06.857 --> 19:08.450
Let's move.

19:08.626 --> 19:11.493
We should do a quick search
of the area.

19:14.331 --> 19:16.026
For bodies.

19:17.635 --> 19:19.296
No, no, you know the rules.

19:19.470 --> 19:23.134
No eating and no sleeping
until you talk.

19:23.307 --> 19:24.433
Tell him again.

19:24.608 --> 19:28.943
I believe you've made that point
abundantly clear in the last 48 hours.

19:29.113 --> 19:30.308
You smell that? Mm?

19:30.481 --> 19:31.778
Smell that garlic?

19:31.949 --> 19:34.213
Because you got to admit,
I'm one hell of a cook.

19:34.385 --> 19:37.719
That's not true. You'd have to admit it
if you could taste it, which you can.

19:37.888 --> 19:39.686
You can if you tell me who it is

19:39.857 --> 19:41.657
that you're communicating with
in the Taliban.

19:41.792 --> 19:43.453
And all you got to do
is give me a name.

19:43.627 --> 19:45.026
What can that hurt?

19:45.196 --> 19:46.322
Translate.

19:46.497 --> 19:48.397
I thought we weren't going
to torture him.

19:50.935 --> 19:53.632
Brother, I know what torture is
and this ain't it.

19:53.804 --> 19:56.171
Seems to be getting pretty damn close.

19:59.109 --> 20:02.943
"Allah Almighty
will strike you American infidels.

20:03.113 --> 20:06.083
Our jihad will spill blood
in the streets."

20:08.152 --> 20:10.382
Hold that thought.
I don't wanna miss a word.

20:11.355 --> 20:13.517
Let me just get this.

20:13.691 --> 20:15.159
Go for the American infidel.

20:15.326 --> 20:16.487
Mr. Deeks.

20:16.660 --> 20:18.321
Hetty,
please tell me something good.

20:18.495 --> 20:19.894
You should know:

20:20.631 --> 20:22.190
Agent Callen

20:22.366 --> 20:26.269
has sent us a photograph
of Agent Blye

20:26.437 --> 20:28.667
that appears...

20:30.007 --> 20:31.031
Hetty.

20:31.842 --> 20:33.708
As if she's been killed.

20:34.745 --> 20:39.342
But we believe that the photograph
is highly suspect.

20:42.853 --> 20:43.877
Send me the photo.

20:44.054 --> 20:45.078
There's no need.

20:45.256 --> 20:47.224
Hetty, send me the...
Hetty, send me the photo.

20:51.996 --> 20:53.930
It's on its way.

20:54.632 --> 20:58.000
Have you gotten any information
from the cleric?

20:58.168 --> 21:00.034
Mr. Deeks...

21:03.374 --> 21:05.502
You know what I'm looking at
right now?

21:07.344 --> 21:10.245
I'm looking at a picture of my partner
with her throat cut.

21:11.582 --> 21:13.550
Is that what you do to women?

21:14.084 --> 21:16.280
Huh? You cut their throats?

21:16.453 --> 21:20.287
You cut off their ears
and their noses?

21:20.457 --> 21:23.297
That's right. Because you're the guys
that shot that girl in the face...

21:23.460 --> 21:24.757
What was her name, Malala?

21:24.928 --> 21:27.625
Because she wanted to go to school.
Is that Islamic law?

21:28.432 --> 21:32.960
To shoot a little girl in the face?
That's Islamic law?

21:35.639 --> 21:38.540
Tell me who is contacting you
from the Taliban. Give me a name.

21:38.709 --> 21:40.109
- Translate.
- Stop it. Get off him.

21:40.277 --> 21:41.745
Get back!

21:41.912 --> 21:44.792
You tell him to give me a name
or I'll shoot him in the chest. Translate.

21:44.948 --> 21:47.148
- This is not gonna get you an answer.
- Give me a name!

21:47.284 --> 21:48.844
This is not gonna get your partner
back.

21:48.986 --> 21:50.852
That.

21:51.355 --> 21:53.221
That is my partner.

21:53.390 --> 21:55.882
Now translate what I told you.

22:02.099 --> 22:03.362
Blood.

22:33.997 --> 22:36.091
I could use some water.

22:36.500 --> 22:38.229
All out, Sabatino.

22:38.402 --> 22:39.801
That sucks.

22:40.371 --> 22:41.861
Did you see Agent Blye?

22:43.707 --> 22:45.300
No.

22:45.542 --> 22:48.603
I caught up to the Taliban.
They shot me.

22:48.779 --> 22:50.076
They headed to Pakistan?

22:50.247 --> 22:51.373
Fast.

22:52.449 --> 22:54.417
Sure could use a pressure bandage,
gentlemen.

22:55.686 --> 22:57.154
What about Jack Simon?

22:57.621 --> 22:58.747
Didn't see either of them.

22:59.189 --> 23:00.884
Don't lie to me.

23:01.058 --> 23:02.753
Is Jack Simon the White Ghost?

23:02.926 --> 23:04.587
There is no White Ghost.

23:05.529 --> 23:06.826
It was made-up.

23:06.997 --> 23:09.489
Jack Simon did some work for us.

23:09.666 --> 23:11.327
His only mistake was

23:11.502 --> 23:14.563
he ended up knowing the identity
of a half a dozen of our assets.

23:14.738 --> 23:16.331
Jack wanted to stay in country.

23:16.507 --> 23:17.838
Only problem is.

23:18.008 --> 23:20.705
CIA can't have Jack Simon
living in some hut,

23:20.878 --> 23:22.437
knowing their names and faces.

23:22.613 --> 23:24.377
- So you're gonna kill him?
- No.

23:24.548 --> 23:26.380
I wanted to get to him first.

23:26.550 --> 23:28.541
Talk him into going back to the U.S.

23:28.719 --> 23:31.017
What about the CIA team
to the north of here?

23:31.388 --> 23:32.913
They are here to kill him.

23:33.090 --> 23:35.081
And they're not gonna give a damn
about Kensi.

23:35.259 --> 23:37.091
Which is why, gentlemen,
we are dark.

23:37.995 --> 23:40.225
Give the man a bandage.

23:50.174 --> 23:51.369
Give me your Sig.

23:52.543 --> 23:53.601
You got an eye on him?

23:54.812 --> 23:56.576
Twenty feet south of the peak.

23:56.747 --> 23:59.717
I'm heading up. Keep him occupied.

24:05.055 --> 24:06.284
Damn it.

24:53.135 --> 24:54.534
Ask her her name.

24:58.007 --> 24:59.168
Khatira.

24:59.341 --> 25:00.672
Khatira.

25:00.843 --> 25:02.709
Is your father a member
of the Taliban?

25:09.051 --> 25:10.485
Her parents are dead.

25:11.420 --> 25:13.616
The Taliban uses orphans like this.

25:13.789 --> 25:16.554
Suicide bombers, soldiers,
slave labor.

25:16.859 --> 25:19.385
They sent her out here
to slow me down.

25:19.562 --> 25:21.326
They don't give a damn
if she lives or dies.

25:21.497 --> 25:24.990
Ask her if the Taliban
has any American prisoners with them.

25:29.905 --> 25:30.997
Doesn't mean anything.

25:31.173 --> 25:33.540
She says yes, she says no,
we're still going forward.

25:33.709 --> 25:36.406
We have
no communication. No water.

25:36.579 --> 25:39.105
And we're gonna have to move
damn fast to catch the Taliban

25:39.281 --> 25:40.578
before they get to the border.

25:40.750 --> 25:41.979
What's your point?

25:43.252 --> 25:44.720
What do you want to do with her?

25:45.121 --> 25:47.112
We leave her here,
she dies of exposure

25:47.289 --> 25:48.450
or the Taliban finds her.

25:48.624 --> 25:50.092
And she tells them all about us.

25:50.526 --> 25:52.290
Position, number of men.

25:52.461 --> 25:53.656
We can't leave her alive.

25:53.829 --> 25:55.354
We're not gonna kill a child.

25:55.531 --> 25:58.228
Agent Callen, why don't you ask
your partner what we should do.

26:12.715 --> 26:13.876
We'll take her with us.

26:14.049 --> 26:17.815
If she slows us down...
And I want you to understand this.

26:17.987 --> 26:20.115
You're trading her life for Kensi's.

26:20.289 --> 26:21.347
She won't.

26:21.524 --> 26:22.753
End of discussion.

26:31.700 --> 26:35.068
Seventy-five-pound girl
across the desert with no water.

26:36.205 --> 26:38.105
How long is that gonna last?

26:47.850 --> 26:49.978
Truth is, the cleric's
never going to talk.

26:53.189 --> 26:55.817
We should be leaving here now.
We're in danger.

26:55.991 --> 26:57.459
We're not leaving.

27:03.532 --> 27:05.830
Maybe you should stop
before you do something you regret.

27:10.673 --> 27:12.767
No. Get back.

27:15.244 --> 27:16.734
Please.

27:17.880 --> 27:19.644
Don't do this.

27:19.815 --> 27:22.375
He's not gonna tell you anything.

27:23.285 --> 27:25.276
You wanna know the truth?

27:28.290 --> 27:30.588
I don't even care if it works.

27:46.976 --> 27:48.137
You good?

27:49.612 --> 27:50.636
Yeah.

28:00.055 --> 28:01.250
That's them.

28:01.423 --> 28:04.415
Too far away to identify Kensi.

28:05.861 --> 28:08.023
Damn, that's a lot of them.

28:12.167 --> 28:13.191
Too many.

28:16.338 --> 28:18.272
We spotted the Taliban
in the valley.

28:18.440 --> 28:22.206
- How many?
- Thirty-five. Way too many to attack.

28:22.378 --> 28:23.743
What are you suggesting?

28:23.913 --> 28:24.937
We don't have much ammo.

28:25.114 --> 28:27.105
We're outnumbered seven to one,
and he's wounded.

28:27.283 --> 28:28.910
I'm not letting them
walk into Pakistan.

28:29.084 --> 28:30.609
I'm willing to cross the border.

28:30.786 --> 28:32.266
But we're gonna have to wait
to attack

28:32.421 --> 28:34.515
until the Afghan soldier comes back
with more men...

28:34.690 --> 28:36.650
He may not come back.
How's he even gonna find us?

28:36.792 --> 28:39.693
- I'm not waiting.
- It's suicide.

28:39.895 --> 28:42.159
They cross over that border,
Kensi is as good as dead.

28:42.331 --> 28:43.560
She might be already.

28:43.732 --> 28:46.531
- I'll do it myself if I have to.
- You'll wait.

28:46.702 --> 28:48.261
That's an order, Agent Callen.

28:49.038 --> 28:52.303
And make no mistake, I'll do
whatever it takes to make you wait.

29:01.350 --> 29:03.444
He's talking about how much
he loves the Taliban.

29:03.619 --> 29:06.054
He's not gonna tell you anything.

29:06.822 --> 29:10.417
You tell him I need the name
of somebody holding the American.

29:10.592 --> 29:13.789
You tell him to give me one name
and I won't do this.

29:18.701 --> 29:19.896
"I don't know any names."

29:21.870 --> 29:23.929
Tell him I'll see him in hell.

29:28.610 --> 29:29.736
Give me a name.

29:30.346 --> 29:32.747
Give me a name!

29:32.915 --> 29:35.816
God, give me a name.
Give me a name.

29:36.185 --> 29:38.415
Breathe, and give me a name.

29:38.587 --> 29:40.954
It's okay, it's okay. It's okay.

29:41.123 --> 29:42.989
You're okay.
You're okay, you're okay.

29:43.158 --> 29:44.523
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, you're okay.

29:44.693 --> 29:47.253
You're okay, all right?
Promise I'm not gonna do it again.

29:47.429 --> 29:49.309
Tell him I'm not gonna do it again.
You're okay.

29:49.465 --> 29:51.194
Tell him!

29:53.302 --> 29:55.361
- It's okay.
- Like I said,

29:55.938 --> 29:58.635
this place changes a man.

29:59.575 --> 30:01.202
It's okay. Shh.

30:01.610 --> 30:02.634
It's okay.

30:08.884 --> 30:10.579
They spotted the Taliban.

30:10.753 --> 30:12.346
They number about 35.

30:12.521 --> 30:13.750
Granger doesn't wanna engage.

30:13.922 --> 30:16.391
We're outnumbered,
we don't have much ammo.

30:16.558 --> 30:17.889
But we've got money.

30:19.161 --> 30:21.789
We got to keep moving.
Stay with us.

30:21.964 --> 30:23.796
Send Sajadi back here.

30:24.666 --> 30:25.690
Go on.

30:32.041 --> 30:34.339
I need you to translate
every word I say.

30:36.578 --> 30:38.478
This is 10,000 American dollars.

30:40.682 --> 30:42.377
We have 500,000 here.

30:43.952 --> 30:47.786
Five hundred thousand U.S. dollars
for the American prisoners.

30:47.956 --> 30:48.980
Do you understand?

30:50.993 --> 30:53.394
We are small in number,
but we will pay.

30:53.562 --> 30:55.223
- Why would you say that?
- Translate.

30:59.234 --> 31:01.498
Take the cash
and you deliver the message.

31:03.138 --> 31:05.470
Run, up the next canyon. Fast.

31:10.712 --> 31:13.340
You know,
it's stupid to beat yourself up

31:13.515 --> 31:16.109
because you're a man too good
to torture another human being.

31:17.386 --> 31:19.684
If I knew it would have worked...

31:21.590 --> 31:23.820
I would have cut off his head
with a razor blade.

31:25.561 --> 31:27.120
Ah. Torture...

31:28.230 --> 31:30.858
it only works in giving our rage
a place to go.

31:31.800 --> 31:33.199
And you, my friend,

31:33.702 --> 31:35.363
you have a lot of rage.

31:37.473 --> 31:39.373
My partner, um...

31:43.645 --> 31:46.615
My partner is the person
I care about most on this planet.

31:48.083 --> 31:49.608
And she's here because of me.

31:49.785 --> 31:52.049
Like you, I despise this man,

31:52.221 --> 31:53.245
and the Taliban.

31:54.056 --> 31:57.117
But in the end,
the question of war and torture...

31:57.292 --> 32:02.162
It's not what it does to our enemies,
but what it does to ourselves.

32:29.625 --> 32:31.059
Here.

32:31.793 --> 32:33.090
Tell him to eat.

32:37.933 --> 32:39.128
Granger.

32:39.801 --> 32:41.394
That's our girl.

32:48.443 --> 32:49.933
Don't even think about it.

32:50.846 --> 32:53.781
- Something tells me she didn't escape.
- I sent her.

32:54.183 --> 32:56.303
She's gonna offer money
in exchange for the prisoners.

32:56.451 --> 32:58.091
She's gonna tell them
everything about us.

32:58.220 --> 33:00.382
Our position,
how many men we have.

33:00.556 --> 33:02.991
It'll at least delay them
going into Pakistan.

33:03.158 --> 33:06.219
He told her
about the rest of the money.

33:08.263 --> 33:10.527
They'll be coming for us now.

33:10.999 --> 33:12.831
But I guess that's what you wanted.

33:29.984 --> 33:31.008
It worked.

33:32.386 --> 33:34.150
Here they come.

33:34.321 --> 33:36.016
You say that like it's a bad thing.

33:40.327 --> 33:42.455
It's time to dig in.

33:43.364 --> 33:44.559
Let's get to higher ground.

33:49.170 --> 33:50.569
Before,

33:51.038 --> 33:54.008
when he was asking for forgiveness
from the Taliban,

33:54.175 --> 33:57.270
saying what I thought
was a term of endearment...

33:57.745 --> 34:00.373
"I love them like my son."

34:00.548 --> 34:05.247
I think what he was saying was,
"I love my son,”

34:05.419 --> 34:07.217
and wanted forgiveness from him.

34:08.121 --> 34:10.887
You mean, if he told us anything,
he'd be betraying his son?

34:11.692 --> 34:12.853
I may be wrong.

34:13.027 --> 34:15.893
Yeah, no, but you found the photo
of that boy. I mean, maybe...

34:18.165 --> 34:19.893
Maybe he's the father
of one of them.

34:20.067 --> 34:22.627
And if a courier is coming here,

34:23.571 --> 34:25.766
then his son must be someone
of high ranking.

34:35.516 --> 34:37.476
They're coming in
just from behind me, just north.

34:37.618 --> 34:39.498
They're coming from the mountain,
from the east.

34:39.652 --> 34:41.882
Sabatino. Here, take these mags.

34:43.858 --> 34:45.382
- Here.
- Here, here.

34:45.559 --> 34:46.822
I see them.

34:46.994 --> 34:48.324
I got six here.

34:50.364 --> 34:52.196
Wait a minute.
They're sending the girl back.

34:56.536 --> 34:58.657
She says they won't kill us
if we give them the money.

34:58.806 --> 35:01.138
No. The deal is
for the American prisoners.

35:11.685 --> 35:12.725
She gave them the message.

35:25.266 --> 35:26.563
Conserve your ammo!

35:27.234 --> 35:29.464
Let them get closer!

35:35.776 --> 35:38.268
Look, you keep fighting.

35:40.648 --> 35:42.707
Keep fighting! Keep shooting!

35:42.883 --> 35:44.612
Turn over!

35:47.021 --> 35:48.250
Nine o'clock!

35:48.422 --> 35:51.483
I got eight over here.
It's too many. Sabatino.

35:53.928 --> 35:56.522
- I'm hit!
- Granger, help him!

35:58.332 --> 36:00.323
Hang on! Hold on.

36:03.704 --> 36:05.297
Ammo's going fast.

36:05.472 --> 36:06.496
Reloading.

36:06.674 --> 36:09.541
Maybe we should surrender.
We're gonna die if we don't.

36:09.710 --> 36:11.269
They're gonna kill us anyway.

36:11.445 --> 36:13.140
We run out of ammo,
we got two hands,

36:13.314 --> 36:14.839
we got knives, we keep fighting.

36:15.015 --> 36:17.109
Hell, yeah. Let them come.

36:20.554 --> 36:23.182
Reloading. Last mag.

36:27.461 --> 36:29.589
Ah, it's jammed! Incoming!

36:42.142 --> 36:43.541
I'm out of ammo!

36:43.711 --> 36:45.577
We should give up!

36:46.614 --> 36:48.309
We should give up!

36:51.752 --> 36:53.413
You hear that?

36:54.021 --> 36:55.045
Do you hear that?

36:57.391 --> 36:58.756
Do you hear that?

37:05.633 --> 37:07.067
Rafik Shahidi.

37:12.239 --> 37:15.368
- What are they saying?
- They have the father of someone.

37:15.542 --> 37:17.442
And they want to do
a prisoner exchange.

37:34.628 --> 37:36.357
They stopped firing.

37:36.930 --> 37:38.728
They've stopped shooting.

38:10.230 --> 38:11.789
Let's go.

38:51.905 --> 38:53.066
You okay?

38:53.240 --> 38:54.469
No.

38:54.641 --> 38:55.904
They beat her up pretty bad.

38:56.076 --> 38:58.876
Let's get the wounded on the chopper.
We got another one coming for us.

39:19.299 --> 39:21.267
Grandmother, this is Fox Three-Zero,

39:21.435 --> 39:23.631
requesting
immediate close air support.

39:23.804 --> 39:26.830
Roger that. Raptor One
on station. Standing by for nine line.

39:27.007 --> 39:29.135
Copy all, Grandmother,
Fox Three-Zero out.

39:29.309 --> 39:31.149
You're calling in an air strike
on the Taliban?

39:31.311 --> 39:32.972
Yeah, they won't make it half a mile.

39:40.888 --> 39:42.049
Khatira.

39:42.222 --> 39:43.587
Khatira.

39:43.757 --> 39:46.920
You go with them, you die.

39:47.895 --> 39:50.455
Come. Come with me.

39:56.403 --> 39:58.132
Put her on the chopper.

40:00.240 --> 40:01.708
Agent Callen.

40:03.844 --> 40:05.312
That was a good mission.

40:08.849 --> 40:10.317
Yeah, it was.

40:14.054 --> 40:15.749
Let's go. Get them out of here.

40:36.343 --> 40:37.606
If there's any way,

40:39.079 --> 40:40.513
I'll be in touch.

40:43.817 --> 40:44.943
Take off.

40:45.118 --> 40:47.314
Granger won't be able
to hold off the CIA for long.

40:54.995 --> 40:56.759
Okay. Bye.

41:07.774 --> 41:10.243
Callen talked you into taking her?

41:12.646 --> 41:13.875
Didn't have to talk too much.

41:15.949 --> 41:18.975
Um, thank you.

41:21.021 --> 41:22.511
Uh, good luck.

41:23.357 --> 41:24.825
You too.

41:40.440 --> 41:41.874
Hey.

41:45.279 --> 41:49.045
Um, Sabatino and Sajadi
are out of surgery.

41:49.216 --> 41:52.914
- Doc says they're going to be okay.
- Oh, thank God. That's good.

41:58.659 --> 42:00.559
I'm really glad you're alive.

42:13.006 --> 42:14.440
How come you never
hug me like that?

42:19.780 --> 42:21.748
They laid out a spread for us
in mess.

42:21.915 --> 42:24.009
Wheels up in two hours.

42:24.184 --> 42:26.414
And Granger got us
a direct flight into Edwards.

42:27.754 --> 42:29.552
Thank you, guys, for what you did.

42:31.658 --> 42:33.490
See you at mess.

42:35.195 --> 42:36.890
See you at the mess.

42:46.773 --> 42:48.764
It's really bad.

42:49.176 --> 42:51.270
No, it's okay. Come here.
Come here.

42:52.114 --> 42:53.172
It's okay.

42:54.748 --> 42:56.409
I got you.

43:02.689 --> 43:04.521
We're going home.

43:06.126 --> 43:07.855
We're going home.
