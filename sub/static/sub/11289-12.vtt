00:02.400 --> 00:06.533
(Trip)
Okay, um, uh, uh, uh, uh.
Well, well, well.

00:06.600 --> 00:09.533
Look who came to
visit my crib on Boardwalk.

00:09.600 --> 00:11.233
You know it's gonna
cost you $200

00:11.300 --> 00:14.233
but we have a live in masseuse
with magic fingers.

00:14.300 --> 00:15.300
Magic fingers, huh?

00:15.366 --> 00:16.766
'Uh, huh, yeah yeah.'

00:16.833 --> 00:17.766
Anyone I know?

00:17.833 --> 00:19.466
'Maybe, maybe not.'

00:19.533 --> 00:21.933
But why don't you spend
the night to find out. Hmm?

00:23.866 --> 00:26.000
For the love of God!

00:26.066 --> 00:27.700
Would you just take
your thimble over to

00:27.766 --> 00:30.100
one of my hotels
and get it on already?

00:30.166 --> 00:33.800
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
we are just friends.

00:33.866 --> 00:35.466
I mean,
Roni has a boyfriend.

00:35.533 --> 00:37.000
Actually, we broke up.

00:38.433 --> 00:39.400
‐ Really?
‐ No.

00:39.466 --> 00:40.900
But I like your enthusiasm.

00:46.066 --> 00:48.200
(Trip)
What? The dog! The dog, dog.

00:49.333 --> 00:50.666
Big, big dog.

00:50.733 --> 00:54.166
‐ B‐big ol' dog.
‐ Walter! <i>Nein!</i>

00:54.233 --> 00:55.633
Where did my dog go?

00:55.700 --> 00:58.800
Uh, hey, I don't know about
a dog but a T‐rex with spots

00:58.866 --> 01:01.206
just trampled through here.

01:01.273 --> 01:02.840
Max, when the hell
did you get a dog?

01:02.906 --> 01:04.206
I picked him up this morning.

01:04.272 --> 01:06.473
You know, I'm just teaching
him a few simple commands.

01:07.673 --> 01:09.806
Walter!
<i>Kommen sie hier!</i>

01:11.206 --> 01:12.273

Mmm, yes,
thank you.

02:14.180 --> 02:15.480
I don't know.

02:20.746 --> 02:22.546
Of course, you know
I lived there in the 70's.

our relationship like that.

03:11.753 --> 03:12.986
‐ Okay.
‐ Now..

03:13.053 --> 03:16.486
The important thing is to

at a little improv theater

04:17.260 --> 04:19.226

Hello, I'm here
to speak on behalf of

04:50.093 --> 04:52.260
our forgotten segment
of society.

04:53.226 --> 04:54.526
You know that one out of ten

04:54.593 --> 04:56.760
Americans has no vowels
in their last name?

04:56.826 --> 05:00.166
It's true.
"Hello, I'm Grazilda Flnh.

05:00.233 --> 05:02.400
F‐L‐N‐H, Flnh!"

05:02.466 --> 05:03.500
See that, no vowels.

05:03.566 --> 05:04.800
And I also drool.
Would you excuse me?

05:04.866 --> 05:07.033
I hope I didn't
catch you out there.

05:07.100 --> 05:10.433
My boyfriend, Bill Prftk,
is also a member.

05:10.500 --> 05:12.500
And he spits when he talks.
And oh, it's scary.

05:12.566 --> 05:14.600
When we have a fight,
we've to wear rain slickers.

05:14.666 --> 05:16.466
Oh, I got you again.
Got you again.

05:16.533 --> 05:18.066

05:25.333 --> 05:28.900
No, I, uh, I get personally
offended by vowel bashing.

Synclaire, uh,

05:37.933 --> 05:40.666
You'll find that character
that'll take you to the top.

05:40.733 --> 05:42.400
‐ Hmm, yeah.
‐ 'Right. Yeah.'

05:44.800 --> 05:47.433
Yeah, well, only top he gonna

05:49.466 --> 05:50.566
Oh, don't mind Marco.

05:50.633 --> 05:52.000
He's just tryin'
to give me the benefit

05:52.066 --> 05:55.466
of all those years of
bitterness, you know.

05:55.533 --> 05:58.333
Hey, looks like one of your
thespian friends left her bag.

06:13.540 --> 06:14.806
Tonight!

06:14.873 --> 06:16.706
I wonder why he didn't
tell us about this.

06:16.773 --> 06:20.440
Cause he's unfunny, talentless
and prefers to bomb in private.

06:22.406 --> 06:24.606
I say we get some rotten
tomatoes and go down there

06:24.673 --> 06:26.073

how to ignore you.

08:21.186 --> 08:22.820
Great show, Marco!

08:22.886 --> 08:25.086

with the material.

08:25.153 --> 08:28.753
Now I'm gonna connect with your

Come on, come on. Baby. Baby..

Baby, come on, now.

08:32.253 --> 08:34.086
You know you're wrong.
You know you're wrong.

08:34.153 --> 08:35.620
You got to lead
with you ring hand.

08:35.686 --> 08:36.785
Do more damage that way.

08:36.852 --> 08:37.953
‐ Here we go.
‐ Okay, okay.

08:38.020 --> 08:39.020
Now it occurs to me that

08:39.086 --> 08:40.020
I understand the reason

08:40.086 --> 08:41.453
you might be tad angry tonight.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.919
As I ratchet back
through tonight's show

08:43.986 --> 08:46.853
I realize that I may have
subconsciously borrowed

08:46.920 --> 08:49.186
one or two lines
from‐from your repertoire.

08:49.253 --> 08:50.953
Borrowed? Borrowed?

08:51.020 --> 08:52.720
You stole my whole..

08:52.786 --> 08:55.286
Oh, you stole
my whole act, man.

08:56.953 --> 08:59.120

Backstabbing, snake, pathetic..

09:05.826 --> 09:07.060
Oh you, you already said
pathetic.

09:07.126 --> 09:08.593
I did,
I did.

09:08.660 --> 09:10.693
You forgot washed up.

09:10.760 --> 09:12.860
Do you know, once upon
a time, I actually

09:12.926 --> 09:14.360
was somebody in this town.

09:14.426 --> 09:17.793
But that was many years
and many Martinis ago.

09:18.660 --> 09:19.626
Anyway..

09:19.693 --> 09:21.293
[wheezes]
After my star fell

09:21.360 --> 09:23.460
my wife took the kids
and left me.

09:23.526 --> 09:26.160
So, I was hoping that
if this show was a success

09:26.226 --> 09:27.393
possibly that

09:27.460 --> 09:29.360
maybe I could begin
to pay child support.

09:29.426 --> 09:31.160
Well..

09:31.226 --> 09:32.726
Silly, silly Marco.

09:33.493 --> 09:34.426
Boy.

09:35.393 --> 09:37.360
Talk about
tears of a clown.

09:39.360 --> 09:42.560
You know I, I give you my word
Synclaire, that this will be

09:42.626 --> 09:46.593
the last brilliant performance
of "Marco, the experience."

09:48.693 --> 09:50.493
Alright, forget it, Marco.

09:50.560 --> 09:53.093
You can keep my characters
as long as you need them.

09:53.160 --> 09:56.693
I just suggest that you work
on the delivery of "Prftk."

09:56.760 --> 09:58.126
I heard a vowel
distinctly in there.

09:58.193 --> 10:00.260
‐ There's no vowels. Get it?
‐ Yes, right. Yes.

Hey, Mr. Jonas, you think
you might have a show

20:43.466 --> 20:45.200
for a home‐spun handyman maybe?

20:45.966 --> 20:47.200
Home‐spun handyman?

20:48.333 --> 20:49.333
Nah.

20:52.500 --> 20:53.900
[bell rings]

20:54.466 --> 20:55.800
Khadijah.

20:55.866 --> 20:57.566
Baby Shaw is hungry.

21:00.340 --> 21:02.540
Alright, here's your, uh,
pepperoni pizza

21:02.606 --> 21:05.640
your chili and your
two garlic pickles.

21:05.706 --> 21:07.106
Mm, on second thought

21:07.173 --> 21:09.406
baby Shaw is suddenly
craving Chinese.

21:11.040 --> 21:13.073
Baby could drag his own behind
down to Tommy

21:13.140 --> 21:14.640
if he wants to feed himself.

21:16.940 --> 21:19.373
Oh, whoa! Oh, oh..

21:19.440 --> 21:20.740
He's a demon dog.

21:20.806 --> 21:23.073
Aah, and here's the name of
a man that will be calling you

21:23.140 --> 21:25.606
about the damage to his Miata.

21:25.673 --> 21:28.473
So, you wanna have
a nice candle light dinner?

21:28.540 --> 21:29.506
Really?

21:29.573 --> 21:33.340
No, but I like
your enthusiasm.

21:33.406 --> 21:35.373
See, that was just a..
See, that was just, uh‐uh..

21:35.440 --> 21:36.473
That was a joke.

21:37.673 --> 21:40.006
Oh, Walter, what am I
gonna do with you?

21:40.073 --> 21:41.806
Oh, mm, look at that.

21:41.873 --> 21:43.506
Baby loves mommy.

21:44.606 --> 21:45.640
You know, you have had

21:45.706 --> 21:47.806
a lot of
sick relationships, Max.

21:49.773 --> 21:50.906
But this one might work.

21:55.973 --> 21:57.973
