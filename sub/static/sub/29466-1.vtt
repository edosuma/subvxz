DARK, ALMOST NIGHT

WHO IS KIDNAPPING KIDS?

03:18.458 --> 03:21.082
I burned my Barbie in the oven!

05:13.125 --> 05:16.749
CURSE! MORE KIDS WILL BE TAKEN!

07:10.666 --> 07:11.666
Daddy!

07:11.833 --> 07:14.207
Where are you, daddy?

07:14.375 --> 07:15.375
I can hear you!

07:16.208 --> 07:17.707
Alice!

07:25.875 --> 07:26.999
Alice!

07:39.250 --> 07:40.250
Alice...

07:41.666 --> 07:42.999
You're back!

07:44.250 --> 07:46.999
I came to work.
I told you over the phone.

07:48.791 --> 07:50.165
I'm writing a story.

07:51.750 --> 07:52.832
You've grown.

07:54.166 --> 07:56.207
I had a lot of time for that.

07:57.416 --> 07:58.582
You came alone?

07:59.333 --> 08:00.790
I go everywhere alone.

08:01.666 --> 08:03.499
I read all your articles.

08:03.666 --> 08:04.707
My kind of girl.

08:07.583 --> 08:09.749
Apples from your garden.

08:10.666 --> 08:12.165
I picked two crates.

08:12.750 --> 08:14.874
The old tree
started giving fruit.

08:15.708 --> 08:17.457
It needs grafting in spring.

08:17.916 --> 08:18.957
I'll help you.

08:19.750 --> 08:22.665
- It's a good tree.
- I won't be here in spring.

08:23.875 --> 08:25.290
You never know.

08:25.791 --> 08:26.915
I'd rather know.

08:37.457 --> 08:38.832
It's here somewhere.

08:39.207 --> 08:41.207
Somewhere here.

08:41.707 --> 08:42.707
The treasure!

08:43.166 --> 08:44.874
When I find Daisy's pearls,

08:45.083 --> 08:47.457
and I have a map
of exceptional value,

08:47.875 --> 08:49.374
and definitely real,

08:49.625 --> 08:51.332
our lives will change.

09:54.083 --> 09:56.124
Ich heisse Hans!

09:56.291 --> 09:58.290
Meine kleine!

10:00.291 --> 10:02.832
Only Hans
has the real map.

10:03.625 --> 10:06.374
It will lead us to
Duchess Daisy's pearls.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.290
Can you imagine?

10:08.458 --> 10:10.040
A six-metre-long string!

10:10.208 --> 10:11.290
It's like...

10:11.666 --> 10:14.374
six Alices placed
one on top of the other.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.457
If we found them,

10:18.416 --> 10:20.707
all of our dreams
would come true!

10:23.583 --> 10:24.915
Do I look like her?

10:25.708 --> 10:27.832
Hans? Do I look like her?

10:28.583 --> 10:29.583
Similar.

10:30.916 --> 10:34.207
And if we can't find
Duchess Daisy's pearls?

10:34.625 --> 10:35.874
What then?

10:39.291 --> 10:42.624
Every once in a while,
bad things will happen here.

10:44.166 --> 10:45.624
Even in the best person,

10:45.791 --> 10:48.957
gateways will open,
allowing evil to get inside.

10:50.500 --> 10:51.582
How?

11:02.125 --> 11:04.082
Through the nose,

11:04.458 --> 11:05.790
ears,

11:06.541 --> 11:07.707
under armpits,

11:08.083 --> 11:09.374
between fingers.

11:13.041 --> 11:15.540
That's why we
have to find the pearls

11:15.791 --> 11:17.957
and take them to the sun.

11:19.125 --> 11:20.582
If we don't do that...

11:21.125 --> 11:22.249
they will show up.

11:22.416 --> 11:23.499
Who?

11:25.000 --> 11:27.665
- Do we have to give them a name?
- Yes.

11:28.708 --> 11:29.708
Fine.

11:34.750 --> 11:36.332
Cat-eaters.

11:38.208 --> 11:39.208
Repeat after me.

11:39.375 --> 11:40.624
Come on, Alice!

11:43.625 --> 11:47.332
There was a black black forest
in this black black forest

11:47.500 --> 11:48.915
was a black black house

11:49.083 --> 11:50.790
in the black black house

11:50.958 --> 11:52.457
was a black black room

11:52.625 --> 11:54.415
in this black black room

11:54.583 --> 11:55.999
was a black black table

11:56.166 --> 11:58.415
with a black black coffin

11:58.583 --> 12:02.124
in this black black coffin
was a white white corpse!

13:29.541 --> 13:31.707
Fuck, you just can't stay away!

13:33.416 --> 13:36.082
- Good morning, sir.
- What's good about it?

13:36.250 --> 13:38.499
Cockroach infesting bastards,

13:38.666 --> 13:40.332
for fuck's sake!

13:41.375 --> 13:44.374
You people do what you want,
fuck me, goddammit!

13:44.541 --> 13:46.374
Not talking to no whore!

13:52.458 --> 13:55.249
Good morning.
My name is Alice Tabor.

13:56.375 --> 13:58.999
I'm a journalist.
We spoke on the phone.

14:07.625 --> 14:09.124
Keep it down!

14:11.000 --> 14:13.165
They always fight
over the remote.

14:13.333 --> 14:16.165
I can't buy each
one of them a TV.

14:17.416 --> 14:19.915
Does Angelica like to watch TV?

14:22.750 --> 14:24.999
From morning to evening and back.

14:26.666 --> 14:28.832
What shows does
she like the most?

14:32.000 --> 14:33.290
What do you mean?

14:35.041 --> 14:37.915
What shows does
your daughter like to watch?

14:43.000 --> 14:44.957
Odds and sods for children.

14:46.916 --> 14:49.457
Teddy bear
and kitten mumbo jumbo.

14:51.166 --> 14:53.915
Dancing with the Stars,
like everybody else.

14:54.208 --> 14:55.665
What do you expect?

15:00.958 --> 15:03.832
Tell me about the day
Angelica went missing.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.665
She wanted to go sledding.

15:24.500 --> 15:25.874
'Mama!

15:29.333 --> 15:32.124
I'll sled a little by the pond.'

15:34.958 --> 15:36.332
So I tell her,

15:36.708 --> 15:37.790
'Angie,

15:39.208 --> 15:40.915
you really want to fly off

15:41.375 --> 15:43.332
to the pond after dark?

15:44.166 --> 15:45.707
Sled on wet snow?

15:47.666 --> 15:49.290
You'll just catch a cold.

15:49.958 --> 15:51.874
Better watch some TV.'

15:53.291 --> 15:54.499
And she goes,

15:54.708 --> 15:57.332
'Mama, just for an hour.'

16:01.833 --> 16:04.582
What was I to do, tie her up?

16:06.666 --> 16:08.874
Tie her up with a cord?

16:16.750 --> 16:17.999
She had this...

16:20.000 --> 16:22.957
apple snow sled
from the supermarket,

16:23.208 --> 16:25.457
so I said, 'Go, dammit, go!'

16:35.083 --> 16:37.040
Little Oscar came to us!

16:39.041 --> 16:41.082
What brings you here, my boy?

16:42.958 --> 16:45.749
Did mommy call you?

16:49.083 --> 16:50.207
Gone.

16:52.875 --> 16:55.707
Come here, mommy
will give you some sweets.

17:01.500 --> 17:02.832
Strange boy.

17:04.833 --> 17:06.915
Won't let anyone touch him.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.249
Anyone but Angie.

17:16.125 --> 17:18.499
She took care
of him like an adult.

17:21.833 --> 17:23.249
The others too, but...

17:23.750 --> 17:24.957
him most of all.

17:26.458 --> 17:28.707
He was the apple of her eye.

17:29.333 --> 17:30.540
Her sonny boy.

17:32.791 --> 17:35.290
She wanted to do
everything around him.

17:35.875 --> 17:38.332
She tucked him in, she fed him.

17:42.166 --> 17:44.457
'What will you be
when you grow up?'

17:45.375 --> 17:47.999
'When I grow up,
I'll be a mommy.'

17:50.000 --> 17:51.415
That's what she said.

17:54.458 --> 17:56.249
She wanted to sleep with him,

17:56.416 --> 17:59.249
said he was tiny and afraid,

17:59.416 --> 18:01.207
but she was the one afraid.

18:02.416 --> 18:03.582
Of what?

18:05.500 --> 18:07.915
She'd watch some crap on TV,

18:08.083 --> 18:10.874
and then she would
wake me up at night.

18:11.041 --> 18:13.707
She would jump
into my bed with Oscar.

18:14.125 --> 18:18.749
She would kick in her sleep,
and then I'd be dazed all day.

18:32.500 --> 18:34.207
I guess you get up early.

18:41.791 --> 18:43.665
I guess you don't have kids.

18:48.791 --> 18:51.832
You think I don't know
what people are saying?

18:52.375 --> 18:53.749
What are they saying?

18:55.750 --> 18:56.790
What?

18:57.208 --> 18:58.832
It's the mother's fault.

19:01.166 --> 19:03.207
The mother has to have eyes...

19:03.500 --> 19:05.374
around her head and up her ass.

19:05.833 --> 19:07.874
She has to see everything.

19:08.708 --> 19:10.457
And I didn't see anything.

19:11.708 --> 19:13.082
Nothing struck me.

19:15.041 --> 19:16.832
I had no bad feeling.

19:25.250 --> 19:26.832
Kitti, kitti, kitti!

19:32.875 --> 19:33.957
Kitti, kitti!

19:35.208 --> 19:36.290
Hello.

19:38.625 --> 19:40.832
You have a nice doll trolley.

19:42.250 --> 19:43.457
This is no doll.

19:45.416 --> 19:46.416
No?

19:48.000 --> 19:49.040
What is it then?

19:51.125 --> 19:52.457
You want to see?

19:53.666 --> 19:54.666
Sure.

20:05.958 --> 20:07.249
What's its name?

20:08.083 --> 20:09.457
Angelica.

20:15.791 --> 20:18.124
That's a very nice
name for a monkey.

20:19.708 --> 20:21.415
Does it like long walks?

20:23.208 --> 20:25.332
But she is dead.

20:27.125 --> 20:28.125
The monkey?

20:28.833 --> 20:29.957
Angelica.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.207
Where did you get it?

20:37.250 --> 20:39.124
Angelica the monkey?

20:52.166 --> 20:53.707
Good afternoon, sir.

20:54.541 --> 20:56.207
I just met your daughter.

20:59.250 --> 21:00.915
We talked for a while.

21:08.208 --> 21:09.624
My dad doesn't speak.

21:09.791 --> 21:11.915
There was
an explosion in the mine.

21:12.083 --> 21:13.124
Gas.

21:23.875 --> 21:26.124
Dad asks what do you want.

21:29.958 --> 21:32.999
Angelica Mizera,
Patryk Milka and Kalinka Jakubek.

21:34.500 --> 21:36.290
I want them to return home.

21:45.541 --> 21:49.082
Dad says you should
stick to the living.

21:50.500 --> 21:52.040
You mean they are dead?

22:01.458 --> 22:02.458
What?

22:03.833 --> 22:06.707
- What did he say?
- 'Look for the unloved.'

22:14.083 --> 22:18.207
...in this black black forest
was a black black house...

22:19.166 --> 22:21.249
on the black black table

22:21.458 --> 22:24.249
was a black black coffin...

22:26.000 --> 22:29.124
in this black black coffin
a white white corpse.

23:52.375 --> 23:53.375
Who are you?

23:54.833 --> 23:56.499
Marcin Schwartz, and you?

23:57.375 --> 23:59.915
What are you doing
in my garden at night?

24:01.041 --> 24:02.249
I'm in your garden?

24:02.833 --> 24:04.040
For the second time.

24:04.208 --> 24:06.665
Really? And when was the first?

24:06.916 --> 24:08.665
What do you want here?

24:10.250 --> 24:12.832
- You are the daughter!
- Daughter?

24:13.208 --> 24:15.165
You're Prof. Tabor's daughter.

24:15.791 --> 24:17.332
You knew my father?

24:18.125 --> 24:19.125
He didn't.

24:20.791 --> 24:22.499
I've been waiting for you.

24:22.750 --> 24:24.707
I got the wrong house, sorry.

24:25.875 --> 24:27.207
What's this about?

24:28.125 --> 24:29.665
What is he doing here?

24:29.833 --> 24:32.832
- Why wasn't I told?
- She always so inquisitive?

24:34.750 --> 24:37.082
Ever since she was born.

24:37.833 --> 24:39.624
Would you invite us for tea?

24:45.666 --> 24:46.666
I don't know

24:48.000 --> 24:49.332
where I was born,

24:50.500 --> 24:53.082
what name I was
given in the beginning.

24:55.708 --> 24:57.332
I am a Gypsy half-breed

24:57.791 --> 24:58.791
from Germany.

25:01.666 --> 25:04.915
I used to live
in your house, Alice.

25:07.041 --> 25:10.499
My mother left me
with a German veterinarian

25:12.625 --> 25:14.040
whose name was

25:14.541 --> 25:16.207
Alfred Schwartz.

25:19.333 --> 25:20.624
He was my father.

25:23.250 --> 25:26.290
I believe she
did it for my good,

25:28.375 --> 25:31.707
that she saved my life
during the Extermination.

25:33.500 --> 25:36.957
Gertrud Schwartz
was my stepmother.

25:37.458 --> 25:40.999
Even sudden weather changes
bothered that woman,

25:41.208 --> 25:44.040
not to mention
family size modifications,

25:44.750 --> 25:46.540
especially without her input.

25:46.916 --> 25:51.207
Now she was supposed to take care of
her husband's Gypsy bastard child,

25:51.708 --> 25:56.332
she, a decent
and righteous housewife.

26:01.750 --> 26:02.957
Your name is Albert.

26:03.666 --> 26:04.999
Albert Schwartz.

26:07.208 --> 26:09.124
Albert... Schwartz!

26:09.625 --> 26:10.665
Repeat!

26:11.250 --> 26:12.832
Albert Schwartz!

26:13.000 --> 26:16.499
My father's second son's
name was Adalbert.

26:16.916 --> 26:18.249
He was exactly my age.

26:21.458 --> 26:25.124
His purpose was to destroy me.

26:41.083 --> 26:43.707
What could a boy
abandoned by his mother

26:44.041 --> 26:45.540
possibly dream of?

26:46.958 --> 26:50.582
That Daisy would
take me in, a Gypsy bastard,

26:51.416 --> 26:55.290
and I would become
her beloved son.

26:56.875 --> 26:58.749
Why are you crying?

27:00.291 --> 27:01.790
Are you lost?

27:06.458 --> 27:07.999
Can I help you somehow?

27:12.291 --> 27:13.999
My name is Daisy.

27:16.625 --> 27:19.874
But fate decided otherwise.

27:44.083 --> 27:45.957
That's Apolonia Kitti Kitti.

28:04.625 --> 28:05.665
Adalbert...

28:06.291 --> 28:08.832
behaved like little Mengele.

28:09.708 --> 28:11.790
He started killing animals.

28:12.541 --> 28:14.499
He did it in cold blood.

28:15.791 --> 28:18.249
The deaths of his victims
nourished him.

28:19.291 --> 28:21.499
And I had a feeling

28:22.250 --> 28:24.499
that it was just a matter of time

28:25.416 --> 28:29.040
before he took a human life.

28:31.291 --> 28:32.832
You can't stay with him.

28:33.958 --> 28:34.999
What should I do?

28:37.375 --> 28:38.375
You'll know

28:38.666 --> 28:39.999
when the time comes.

28:40.791 --> 28:41.791
But...

28:42.083 --> 28:43.124
where will I go?

28:44.166 --> 28:45.707
Where should I go?

28:48.291 --> 28:49.291
On the night

28:50.333 --> 28:53.165
before the Schwartzes
fled from the Soviets,

28:53.791 --> 28:54.791
I didn't sleep.

28:55.500 --> 28:57.874
I waited until
the house fell silent.

28:59.958 --> 29:01.499
I didn't take anything,

29:01.666 --> 29:02.915
not even my papers,

29:04.333 --> 29:06.499
as the identity
inscribed in them

29:08.291 --> 29:09.665
did not belong to me.

29:13.708 --> 29:14.708
Alice...

29:16.833 --> 29:19.207
this here Marcin Schwartz,

29:20.833 --> 29:23.624
whom you attacked
so expertly tonight,

29:25.541 --> 29:26.665
is my nephew,

29:28.791 --> 29:31.082
Adalbert's son.

30:56.750 --> 30:59.582
Lately, these eggs
were all he wanted.

30:59.916 --> 31:00.916
He would say,

31:01.875 --> 31:05.915
'Grandma, it's wonderful
not to know what is inside,

31:06.083 --> 31:09.749
and slowly bite off
the chocolate before you open it.'

31:11.208 --> 31:13.499
That made my heart sting.

31:15.333 --> 31:18.249
He waited for his mom
with such anticipation.

31:23.166 --> 31:24.290
So I said to him,

31:24.708 --> 31:30.040
'Patryk, let's change and catch
a bus to the supermarket.'

31:30.916 --> 31:31.916
it was crowded.

31:32.083 --> 31:35.249
First we went to get
some chicken thighs,

31:35.416 --> 31:37.082
next to the candy stands.

31:37.625 --> 31:39.082
I said, 'Patryk,

31:39.666 --> 31:41.165
don't you move.

31:41.875 --> 31:45.415
Stay here by the Kinder
Surprise eggs, pick two.

31:46.250 --> 31:47.290
Mind our cart,

31:47.458 --> 31:51.415
I'll just grab some oil,
I hear they have it on sale.'

31:51.666 --> 31:54.457
I took some rapeseed oil
and I went back.

31:54.625 --> 31:56.957
It's even more
crowded than before.

31:57.291 --> 31:58.332
I look around...

31:59.000 --> 32:00.165
Patryk isn't there.

32:00.750 --> 32:02.499
Just the shopping cart.

32:03.333 --> 32:05.207
Maybe he strolled off somewhere

32:05.375 --> 32:06.999
and he'Il be right back.

32:08.958 --> 32:10.874
I'm waiting. What can I do?

32:11.291 --> 32:13.874
I started asking
around the supermarket,

32:14.041 --> 32:17.457
'Boy, blond,
six years old, hazel eyes!

32:17.625 --> 32:20.499
Have you seen him,
madame, sir, and you, girl?'

32:20.666 --> 32:22.832
No one saw
or heard anything!

32:23.000 --> 32:25.582
Who would care for
someone else's kids

32:25.750 --> 32:27.790
in such a crowd
while shopping?

32:28.125 --> 32:30.457
Supermarkets
are best for losing kids!

32:33.083 --> 32:34.499
It's been five months.

32:36.333 --> 32:37.333
Two days short.

32:39.541 --> 32:41.499
Two days and three hours.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.040
You're counting?

32:46.208 --> 32:47.457
I'll never stop.

32:56.708 --> 32:59.540
When he disappeared,
your daughter didn't come?

33:01.291 --> 33:02.832
Such misfortune.

33:04.375 --> 33:05.375
She said,

33:06.583 --> 33:09.249
'What can I do,
how can I help?

33:09.416 --> 33:12.874
I have to keep an eye
on things here in Ireland.'

33:13.041 --> 33:14.249
'What things?

33:14.416 --> 33:16.040
What things, I ask?

33:16.208 --> 33:17.874
Probably your new lay!'

33:21.500 --> 33:22.582
Then she says

33:23.500 --> 33:25.582
it's my fault

33:25.750 --> 33:29.040
Patryk disappeared,
as I didn't take good care of him.

33:31.625 --> 33:33.415
And for him I would

33:33.583 --> 33:37.499
give up my last drop of blood!

33:37.666 --> 33:39.415
Anything for that child!

33:41.416 --> 33:42.457
And now...

33:44.041 --> 33:46.374
I'm making beetroot preserves.

33:48.333 --> 33:49.999
Very good this year.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.124
So sweet.

33:55.041 --> 33:56.041
And I'm thinking,

33:58.083 --> 33:59.290
'Why do this?

34:01.791 --> 34:02.832
For whom?'

34:06.500 --> 34:07.874
Such misfortune!

36:23.250 --> 36:25.707
Tired like the Mother of God!

36:27.166 --> 36:28.166
Startled you?

36:31.041 --> 36:33.665
I got some cat-cans.

36:34.958 --> 36:36.290
Cat-cans?

36:36.458 --> 36:38.207
Cans with cat-stew.

36:38.375 --> 36:40.915
I just mix it with
some noodles and...

36:41.083 --> 36:43.957
there you go,
delicious cat-stew!

36:47.416 --> 36:48.749
Have we met?

36:49.875 --> 36:51.707
What does it matter?

36:53.750 --> 36:55.499
I'm Babs.

37:07.291 --> 37:08.707
Care for a cat-crunch?

37:09.958 --> 37:10.999
No.

37:11.375 --> 37:12.915
No eating when I run.

37:23.125 --> 37:24.457
Some cat-milk?

37:37.458 --> 37:39.499
- I have to go.
- So soon?

37:40.333 --> 37:41.499
No time.

37:43.458 --> 37:45.332
- I'll help.
- You are helping.

37:46.208 --> 37:47.332
I don't understand.

37:47.500 --> 37:50.165
You don't have to,
just do your thing.

37:56.416 --> 37:57.416
Babs!

37:57.583 --> 37:59.540
Do you know
Apolonia Kitti Kitti?

38:01.750 --> 38:03.582
There's a tempest of us!

38:53.166 --> 38:55.332
Welcome to our humble abode!

39:08.958 --> 39:10.290
Between you and me?

39:10.958 --> 39:11.999
That's right.

39:13.875 --> 39:15.082
In my opinion,

39:15.875 --> 39:18.124
the problem in Poland is that

39:18.291 --> 39:21.332
not those have
children who should.

39:23.041 --> 39:25.874
The intelligentsia have one,
two at the most.

39:26.125 --> 39:28.082
Louts? A dozen!

39:30.166 --> 39:31.915
Do you have a child?

39:32.291 --> 39:33.332
No.

39:36.125 --> 39:38.915
Do you know what sort
of kids make it here?

39:39.083 --> 39:40.083
Tell me.

39:42.666 --> 39:43.666
Broken.

39:45.125 --> 39:48.540
Gluing them back together
doesn't always work because...

39:49.166 --> 39:50.415
pieces are missing.

39:51.041 --> 39:54.499
And what we glue together,
on the next day goes to hell.

39:55.166 --> 39:57.082
Because a kid like that is...

39:58.833 --> 40:00.040
damaged.

40:01.208 --> 40:03.124
Like a crushed toy.

40:04.458 --> 40:05.458
You know,

40:05.625 --> 40:08.582
with some kids,
it's enough to hit them once.

40:09.250 --> 40:10.290
Once.

40:11.083 --> 40:13.165
And it leaves a crack.

40:14.833 --> 40:16.165
And children here...

40:17.041 --> 40:19.165
have marks
from such thrashings...

40:27.250 --> 40:29.040
that when I see them, I think,

40:29.208 --> 40:30.208
'You bastard!

40:31.125 --> 40:33.082
If you tried that with me...!'

40:34.750 --> 40:36.790
Would you hit a child?

40:37.375 --> 40:38.457
Never.

40:44.333 --> 40:46.707
What about
Kalinka Jakubek's parents?

40:51.750 --> 40:54.040
Kalinka's mother, Ada Ryba,

40:54.208 --> 40:56.207
she was in our home as well.

40:57.750 --> 40:59.749
She got here late.

41:01.958 --> 41:03.957
An eight-year-old girl

41:04.833 --> 41:06.582
remembers too much.

41:08.708 --> 41:10.124
Can't rub it out.

41:14.916 --> 41:16.582
I'll fuck you up!

41:16.750 --> 41:18.040
Fucking kill you!

41:18.208 --> 41:19.665
Get over here, bitch!

41:20.625 --> 41:22.124
I'll smash your face in!

41:25.083 --> 41:26.749
Get over here, bitch!

41:27.208 --> 41:28.374
Come on!

41:28.833 --> 41:30.082
Right there!

41:31.958 --> 41:33.624
Get the fuck out!

41:35.291 --> 41:36.624
Fucking whore!

41:36.791 --> 41:38.374
Get the fuck out!

41:39.500 --> 41:41.665
Shut your trap, you cunt!

41:42.916 --> 41:43.999
Fuck...

41:54.125 --> 41:57.749
Long live the ball!

41:57.916 --> 42:03.165
Because life
Is a ball of all balls!

42:03.333 --> 42:07.165
Long live the ball!

42:07.333 --> 42:12.832
Next time they
Won't invite us at all

42:40.333 --> 42:41.915
'Did you grab a knife?'

42:43.125 --> 42:44.165
'No.'

42:47.083 --> 42:49.790
'Then who killed your parents?'

42:51.583 --> 42:52.707
'Santa Claus.

42:54.166 --> 42:55.624
In red boots.'

42:58.833 --> 43:00.290
You heard it right.

43:00.791 --> 43:02.082
Santa Claus.

43:04.125 --> 43:05.374
How did he enter?

43:06.458 --> 43:07.957
Knocked on the window.

43:08.916 --> 43:10.207
So they let him in.

43:13.333 --> 43:16.415
Maybe if Santa Claus
took care of such things,

43:16.583 --> 43:19.582
he would be of more use
than his presents.

43:22.583 --> 43:27.082
But what should be done
about little murderers?

43:29.375 --> 43:30.499
Nobody knew.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.915
Because a child
and a killer don't go together.

43:36.041 --> 43:37.041
They don't mix.

43:38.541 --> 43:40.790
They thought
about it and decided,

43:40.958 --> 43:43.457
it would be best
to separate the children,

43:43.625 --> 43:45.332
and erase their past.

43:46.291 --> 43:49.165
Supposedly, apart
they would forget faster.

43:50.250 --> 43:51.707
Ada came to us.

44:10.208 --> 44:12.249
She concealed her feelings.

44:12.666 --> 44:16.207
She waited until
she could legally go out

44:16.375 --> 44:18.207
to find her brother.

44:19.416 --> 44:21.499
That's all she cared about.

44:36.041 --> 44:37.082
Is it alive?

44:39.083 --> 44:40.165
The swallowtail.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
It is.

45:00.208 --> 45:01.208
It's suffering.

45:03.583 --> 45:04.583
Why?

45:06.291 --> 45:07.540
It can't fly away.

45:22.833 --> 45:25.499
Did the accused
know it was his sister?

45:26.708 --> 45:27.708
No.

45:28.750 --> 45:31.082
So the accused
did not recognize her?

45:32.916 --> 45:34.749
Something seemed familiar...

45:36.666 --> 45:38.332
when she came in...

45:40.500 --> 45:42.832
but I didn't know
it was my sister.

45:43.541 --> 45:44.541
And later?

45:46.666 --> 45:47.666
Later, I did.

46:01.916 --> 46:06.165
Why did you leave your family
and bind yourself with your sister?

46:07.500 --> 46:08.915
...bound together.

46:09.333 --> 46:10.415
Speak up, please!

46:15.541 --> 46:17.790
We already
were bound together.

46:19.500 --> 46:21.124
Ada got pregnant.

46:22.125 --> 46:23.707
She had a girl.

46:24.291 --> 46:25.915
A healthy, normal girl.

46:26.500 --> 46:29.915
Two hands,
two feet, a set of fingers.

46:30.875 --> 46:34.249
And in such cases,
even animals

46:34.416 --> 46:36.999
have deformed offspring.

46:38.375 --> 46:40.499
They named her Kalinka.

46:40.666 --> 46:42.332
I wanted them to go away.

46:43.458 --> 46:44.499
Who?

46:46.958 --> 46:47.958
Them.

46:49.041 --> 46:50.415
Who exactly?

46:50.583 --> 46:52.874
Who are they?
Please provide names.

46:53.833 --> 46:55.040
I don't know any.

46:55.708 --> 46:57.457
Please describe them then.

47:02.375 --> 47:03.540
They get inside...

47:04.500 --> 47:06.290
Speak up!
What do they do?

47:08.833 --> 47:11.457
They penetrate through walls...

47:12.375 --> 47:13.540
through the body,

47:15.000 --> 47:17.332
and when they get inside...

47:19.083 --> 47:20.499
everything rots

47:21.250 --> 47:23.374
and fills up with stinking fog.

47:23.916 --> 47:26.332
- Whom does the accused mean?
- Them!

47:44.708 --> 47:46.915
Why did the accused
blind himself?

47:49.208 --> 47:51.457
So I wouldn't
have to look anymore.

47:52.541 --> 47:55.207
What didn't the accused
want to look at?

47:57.166 --> 47:58.166
At myself.

48:19.750 --> 48:23.290
He didn't admit
to setting the house on fire.

48:26.875 --> 48:31.165
They found one body
in the cinders.

48:33.833 --> 48:35.124
Ada's body.

48:35.958 --> 48:37.957
The baby was not there.

48:40.250 --> 48:43.665
Three days later,
somebody left a girl

48:44.750 --> 48:46.707
in the maternity hospital.

48:48.416 --> 48:50.499
She was clean.

48:52.208 --> 48:53.290
And healthy.

48:54.625 --> 48:58.915
DNA tests confirmed
it was Kalinka.

49:00.291 --> 49:02.415
Ada's and Adam's daughter.

49:06.666 --> 49:09.165
I gave her
the 'Jakubek' surname.

49:11.208 --> 49:13.957
Because she was born
on St. Jacob's day.

49:17.416 --> 49:18.582
Strangest thing...

49:21.541 --> 49:23.249
She had a pearl on her,

49:23.875 --> 49:25.665
tied around her wrist.

49:40.708 --> 49:43.165
I'll give it to her
when she grows up.

49:50.791 --> 49:52.082
Mareczek!

50:07.416 --> 50:09.415
Please tell me about Kalinka.

50:10.250 --> 50:11.290
What's she like?

50:12.458 --> 50:14.124
The director's favourite.

50:17.375 --> 50:21.332
She started speaking late,
but once she did, she wouldn't stop.

50:23.208 --> 50:27.165
She would sit in the director's
office and jabber away!

50:29.041 --> 50:30.457
A chatterer she was!

50:32.291 --> 50:33.707
I would say, 'Marian,

50:34.500 --> 50:36.999
she will jabber you
to death someday.'

50:38.833 --> 50:40.374
What did she talk about?

50:43.541 --> 50:44.541
About the sea.

50:47.583 --> 50:49.165
Some memory he has!

50:50.750 --> 50:52.457
What did she say about it?

50:53.291 --> 50:56.124
That she wanted
to go to the seaside.

50:58.041 --> 51:01.249
'Why the sea?
You have never seen it!'

51:02.000 --> 51:03.040
'I have!'

51:03.208 --> 51:06.124
- 'On TV, maybe.'
- 'No, in my head!'

51:07.791 --> 51:09.999
'Why do you want to go there?

51:10.666 --> 51:12.957
Go for a swim, make mud pies?'

51:15.958 --> 51:18.165
'I want to drown something there.'

51:20.458 --> 51:22.874
No idea what she
wanted to drown there.

51:27.833 --> 51:28.874
Cat-eaters.

51:33.916 --> 51:35.165
Cat-eaters?

51:51.500 --> 51:52.707
You got a backrag?

51:54.291 --> 51:55.749
- Babs?
- Who else?

51:55.916 --> 51:59.457
Holy Cat Mamma with
an invitation for Daisy's ball?

52:03.250 --> 52:05.374
- Got a backrag?
- What's that?

52:06.208 --> 52:08.082
A coat or something, girl!

52:08.416 --> 52:11.415
- You need a coat?
- Mama Winter won't let up.

52:13.625 --> 52:16.332
- Come in. Have some tea with me.
- Oh no!

52:16.500 --> 52:19.749
I have to run. I have cat-crunch
for the hungry ones.

52:29.791 --> 52:30.791
There.

52:33.583 --> 52:36.499
Grand backrag!

52:38.375 --> 52:40.540
Don't go running
around the fields!

52:40.708 --> 52:41.749
What?

52:46.500 --> 52:49.207
- Wait!
- Lock the door! Use the staple!

53:09.708 --> 53:11.040
Dear Alice!

53:13.000 --> 53:14.832
When you get this letter,

53:15.916 --> 53:17.874
I will no longer be with you.

53:19.916 --> 53:21.624
I am infected with death,

53:23.041 --> 53:25.124
that's the nature
of my disease.

53:26.250 --> 53:27.624
This is its secret.

53:31.791 --> 53:35.665
I don't know how to explain this
to a teenybopper you are.

53:36.291 --> 53:37.749
I'm heart-broken,

53:38.291 --> 53:39.582
as there are things

53:40.125 --> 53:43.207
which little girls
shouldn't have to hear about.

53:47.333 --> 53:51.082
I will write to the Alice
you will become in several years.

53:52.791 --> 53:54.832
To a grown-up Alice.

53:57.625 --> 53:58.625
Because...

53:58.916 --> 54:00.040
you will grow up.

54:03.500 --> 54:05.124
A cat lady will make sure

54:05.291 --> 54:07.832
this letter reaches you
in proper time.

54:10.583 --> 54:11.624
Our mother...

54:12.708 --> 54:14.040
Anna Lipiec.

54:15.291 --> 54:16.874
I have to start with her.

54:18.958 --> 54:21.332
I will tell you all
I know about her

54:22.333 --> 54:24.415
because no one else will.

54:25.875 --> 54:28.624
I am sorry
I have to hurt you now.

55:24.708 --> 55:26.082
Mama!

55:26.500 --> 55:29.082
Mommy!

56:01.250 --> 56:04.040
- Mommy!
- Come on!

56:08.458 --> 56:09.957
Quick!

56:46.875 --> 56:48.082
Alice,

56:48.958 --> 56:49.958
it's time.

56:51.375 --> 56:53.665
It's Duchess Daisy
calling her cat.

56:57.333 --> 56:58.457
Live beautifully.

56:59.416 --> 57:00.416
Alice,

57:01.416 --> 57:02.457
live!

57:05.375 --> 57:06.375
Eva

57:31.875 --> 57:32.915
Eva?

59:15.875 --> 59:16.875
You think...

59:18.000 --> 59:19.582
we could just go to bed?

01:01:14.583 --> 01:01:15.583
Hello?

01:01:17.583 --> 01:01:18.583
Hello?

01:01:33.166 --> 01:01:34.166
Hello?

01:01:34.458 --> 01:01:37.332
Alice Tabor speaking. You called.

01:01:39.375 --> 01:01:40.375
Me?

01:01:40.708 --> 01:01:42.624
What did you want to tell me?

01:01:49.291 --> 01:01:50.540
Could we meet?

01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:54.624
- I'll come to you.
- I'm in the hospital.

01:01:55.541 --> 01:01:58.040
My heart failed me,
a vein got blocked.

01:01:58.333 --> 01:02:00.207
Tomorrow they cut me open.

01:02:00.375 --> 01:02:01.915
I can come today.

01:02:02.791 --> 01:02:06.624
I was chopping liver and suddenly
lost my breath and collapsed.

01:02:06.791 --> 01:02:08.249
Tomorrow they operate.

01:02:08.416 --> 01:02:09.915
It will be all right.

01:02:10.083 --> 01:02:11.832
I'm in room 6,
internal ward.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.040
Okay.

01:03:32.333 --> 01:03:33.832
I came to say goodbye.

01:03:34.208 --> 01:03:35.208
Come on in.

01:03:35.375 --> 01:03:37.374
I'm going back
to Warsaw tonight.

01:03:38.458 --> 01:03:40.624
Do you have
what you came for?

01:03:41.083 --> 01:03:42.874
I've got my story.

01:03:43.166 --> 01:03:45.332
I talked to
the kids' caretakers.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.832
I met Babs recently.

01:03:55.666 --> 01:03:56.957
I gave her a scarf.

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:10.500
Who are they?

01:04:15.875 --> 01:04:18.374
That's the last thing
I'd like to know.

01:04:21.916 --> 01:04:22.916
The cat ladies?

01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:28.207
To this question
I have no simple answer.

01:04:30.166 --> 01:04:32.707
But I will tell you
what happened next.

01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:53.749
What's your name?

01:05:07.291 --> 01:05:08.749
I'm Albert.

01:05:09.291 --> 01:05:10.832
I live in these woods.

01:05:13.416 --> 01:05:15.540
There isn't a soul here but us.

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:22.457
Please, sit with me.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000
I'm Rosemarie.

01:06:20.125 --> 01:06:21.582
Where are your parents?

01:06:26.375 --> 01:06:28.415
They went away.
With suitcases.

01:06:37.333 --> 01:06:38.707
Kitti, ktti, kitti!

01:06:42.958 --> 01:06:44.207
Kitti, ktti, kitti!

01:06:47.083 --> 01:06:48.332
Kitti, ktti, kitti!

01:06:48.791 --> 01:06:51.915
We knew nothing about
Hitler's capitulation,

01:06:52.708 --> 01:06:54.790
as Rosemarie and I didn't know

01:06:54.958 --> 01:07:00.040
that soon a different sort of evil
was to roll through the city.

01:07:01.333 --> 01:07:04.374
But Apolonia Kitti Kitti knew.

01:07:04.958 --> 01:07:06.332
Kitti, kitti, kitti!

01:07:08.583 --> 01:07:09.624
Kitti, kitti!

01:08:20.041 --> 01:08:21.790
I cannot tell you

01:08:22.291 --> 01:08:24.749
where we buried Duchess Daisy.

01:08:25.750 --> 01:08:29.582
I promised I would not
reveal that to anyone.

01:08:30.666 --> 01:08:35.665
On the following day,
Red Army soldiers entered the city.

01:08:36.541 --> 01:08:40.915
That afternoon I saw
smoke rising over the castle,

01:08:41.875 --> 01:08:44.790
so I decided
to take a closer look.

01:08:47.291 --> 01:08:49.624
I knew an underground passage

01:08:50.166 --> 01:08:53.165
which led to the castle gardens.

01:08:56.375 --> 01:09:00.124
'No one will burn down
Duchess Daisy's home,'

01:09:01.707 --> 01:09:04.915
thought the boy that I was.

01:12:45.958 --> 01:12:46.958
Rosemarie!

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Why?

01:13:11.458 --> 01:13:12.915
We can't help her.

01:13:36.958 --> 01:13:38.124
I'll be going now.

01:13:39.625 --> 01:13:40.957
Where is Rosemarie?

01:13:45.375 --> 01:13:46.375
And I?

01:13:46.916 --> 01:13:48.040
What should I do?

01:13:48.458 --> 01:13:50.499
Wait until winter and go back.

01:13:52.250 --> 01:13:53.250
There?

01:13:53.708 --> 01:13:54.874
To Gertud's house?

01:14:09.791 --> 01:14:12.540
I did as Apolonia Kitti Kitti said.

01:14:14.083 --> 01:14:16.540
But the Schwartzes'
house was occupied.

01:14:17.250 --> 01:14:19.040
And nobody wanted me there.

01:14:20.875 --> 01:14:22.999
The Kukulkas took me in,

01:14:23.166 --> 01:14:24.249
your neighbours.

01:14:26.333 --> 01:14:28.124
I, their claimed son,

01:14:28.708 --> 01:14:30.999
lived my life as Albert Kukulka.

01:14:32.458 --> 01:14:34.249
And as Albert Kukulka

01:14:35.375 --> 01:14:36.582
I once again

01:14:37.666 --> 01:14:39.582
met Rosemarie

01:14:40.791 --> 01:14:42.957
who also had changed her name.

01:14:45.166 --> 01:14:46.249
Your father,

01:14:46.916 --> 01:14:48.249
and my friend,

01:14:49.083 --> 01:14:51.332
brought her along once and said,

01:14:52.208 --> 01:14:54.749
'This is my fiancée, Anna Lipiec.'

01:15:03.291 --> 01:15:04.499
Rosemarie...

01:15:05.583 --> 01:15:07.249
is your mother.

01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:24.540
What do you call
that what you do?

01:16:28.541 --> 01:16:29.749
I need a name.

01:16:30.916 --> 01:16:31.916
That's how I am.

01:16:39.458 --> 01:16:40.790
I track cat-eaters,

01:16:42.083 --> 01:16:44.082
as your sister called them.

01:16:45.916 --> 01:16:48.582
I don't name them,
but I can recognize them.

01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:53.165
You are a bit like me,
and that's enough.

01:16:57.166 --> 01:16:58.166
Right.

01:17:00.958 --> 01:17:03.040
And I look for missing children.

01:17:04.041 --> 01:17:05.041
That's all.

01:17:05.375 --> 01:17:06.457
I have to.

01:17:07.416 --> 01:17:11.082
Just like you have to collect
stories and ask questions.

01:17:19.250 --> 01:17:20.957
You don't name cat-eaters.

01:17:23.958 --> 01:17:26.665
Is that why you never
talk about Adalbert?

01:17:30.208 --> 01:17:32.457
He doesn't deserve his own story.

01:17:38.833 --> 01:17:39.999
You're his son.

01:17:41.291 --> 01:17:43.249
Without him,
you wouldn't exist.

01:17:44.041 --> 01:17:47.957
Who cares whose egg cell
and sperm were there to start with?

01:17:49.541 --> 01:17:51.499
What counts is what we do now.

01:17:59.458 --> 01:18:00.749
I like to know.

01:18:02.708 --> 01:18:04.874
The history of things and people.

01:18:06.916 --> 01:18:08.957
The deeper it goes, the better.

01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:16.124
What if somebody doesn't
want to tell you their story?

01:18:18.916 --> 01:18:20.499
Eventually everyone does.

01:18:22.833 --> 01:18:24.999
I just wait for the right moment.

01:18:26.958 --> 01:18:28.457
And the right question.

01:18:39.791 --> 01:18:41.540
- Hello?
- He's disappeared!

01:18:41.791 --> 01:18:44.249
Mareczek, my son. He's gone!

01:19:00.125 --> 01:19:01.165
Marian...

01:19:01.458 --> 01:19:03.165
Out!

01:19:20.666 --> 01:19:22.999
Marek likes children.

01:19:29.791 --> 01:19:31.165
He likes kids.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.707
Without any subtext.

01:19:37.416 --> 01:19:38.624
Just likes them.

01:19:42.083 --> 01:19:44.249
They caught him in the bushes

01:19:45.250 --> 01:19:47.290
in New Town, next to...

01:19:48.583 --> 01:19:49.999
a kindergarten,

01:19:51.708 --> 01:19:53.082
saying that...

01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:56.582
he was masturbating.

01:19:58.791 --> 01:20:02.124
That was just a call of nature.

01:20:05.041 --> 01:20:06.832
He's got sick kidneys.

01:20:10.916 --> 01:20:12.332
And now...

01:20:14.333 --> 01:20:15.374
I, the father...

01:20:18.708 --> 01:20:20.624
have to talk about this...

01:20:23.250 --> 01:20:25.082
with a woman!

01:20:45.291 --> 01:20:46.624
Kalinka.

01:20:56.625 --> 01:20:57.625
Marek...

01:20:59.375 --> 01:21:00.874
inherited a house.

01:21:02.958 --> 01:21:04.374
From his grandmother.

01:21:10.375 --> 01:21:11.790
The address and keys.

01:21:21.041 --> 01:21:22.290
Out, you bitch!

01:21:26.208 --> 01:21:28.040
Pawel Kupczyk, aged 44.

01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:30.624
Spent six years
in a German prison.

01:21:30.791 --> 01:21:32.040
Robbery and burglary.

01:21:32.208 --> 01:21:33.499
In jail he met people

01:21:33.666 --> 01:21:35.582
from child pornography circles.

01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:37.207
He found it appealing.

01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:38.999
Cat-eater!

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.040
Marek?

01:23:28.875 --> 01:23:30.707
We have to split up. No time!

01:23:30.875 --> 01:23:32.999
- Wait!
- See you up top.

01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:32.624
What have you done with the boy?

01:28:35.041 --> 01:28:36.624
What boy?

01:28:38.208 --> 01:28:40.207
Mareczek, I did it all for you!

01:28:40.916 --> 01:28:42.415
For your transplant.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.124
Money can buy anything.

01:28:48.291 --> 01:28:49.915
A kidney, a kid, anything.

01:28:53.583 --> 01:28:56.624
You'll get better and we'll leave.

01:29:00.291 --> 01:29:01.790
She was only five!

01:29:11.125 --> 01:29:13.165
- Five!
- A little whore!

01:29:13.333 --> 01:29:15.665
Shakes her ass
and jumps on your lap!

01:29:15.833 --> 01:29:18.207
- And your father is mesmerised!
- No!

01:29:21.875 --> 01:29:22.875
Sonny...

01:29:23.666 --> 01:29:25.165
My boy, you don't know,

01:29:25.708 --> 01:29:28.749
what it's like,
with a man like your father,

01:29:30.125 --> 01:29:31.624
night after night...

01:29:32.916 --> 01:29:35.082
night after night,
to be crucified.

01:29:36.333 --> 01:29:38.165
For 36 years.

01:29:39.125 --> 01:29:40.749
Christ suffered shorter.

01:29:43.416 --> 01:29:44.665
But you are mine.

01:29:48.791 --> 01:29:49.791
Mareczek...

01:29:51.958 --> 01:29:54.165
Sonny, my child...

01:29:54.333 --> 01:29:55.832
You are mine!

01:29:56.375 --> 01:29:58.915
Mine, Mareczek!

01:30:00.916 --> 01:30:03.499
Please, believe me!

01:30:07.750 --> 01:30:09.582
I didn't see anything.

01:30:10.125 --> 01:30:13.040
I only helped them find kids.

01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:18.749
Easy...

01:30:19.416 --> 01:30:20.416
Easy...

01:30:26.833 --> 01:30:28.915
We have to get out of here.

01:30:36.166 --> 01:30:41.124
Remember, you used to say,
'Let's fly away, mommy!

01:30:41.666 --> 01:30:43.999
We'll fly to America!'

01:30:45.666 --> 01:30:47.040
Remember that?

01:30:54.125 --> 01:30:55.165
Just you and me.

01:30:59.625 --> 01:31:00.874
- Quiet...
- Mommy...

01:31:01.958 --> 01:31:03.582
Mommy's here.

01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:08.874
Mommy...

01:31:09.250 --> 01:31:10.915
I'm here, baby.

01:31:13.416 --> 01:31:15.540
Mommy will never leave you.

01:31:17.041 --> 01:31:18.207
Mommy...

01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:23.874
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.624
Twinkle, twinkle,

01:31:31.083 --> 01:31:32.582
little star,

01:31:37.958 --> 01:31:41.540
How I wonder...

01:31:45.458 --> 01:31:47.290
...where you are.

01:31:48.708 --> 01:31:51.124
Twinkle, twinkle...

01:32:35.458 --> 01:32:37.040
Who are you?

01:32:40.291 --> 01:32:41.707
My name is Alice.

01:32:42.333 --> 01:32:44.374
You came to me?

01:32:46.333 --> 01:32:47.333
Yes.

01:32:48.750 --> 01:32:50.582
And will you stay?

01:33:00.250 --> 01:33:01.250
I will.

01:33:02.291 --> 01:33:04.457
Is it night now?

01:33:07.625 --> 01:33:09.707
Yes, you've slept for a long time.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:13.082
I slept and dreamt of the sea.

01:33:14.041 --> 01:33:16.290
Have you ever been to the sea?

01:33:18.333 --> 01:33:19.333
I have.

01:33:20.750 --> 01:33:23.207
Can you make a sound like the sea?

01:33:25.166 --> 01:33:26.166
I'll try.

01:33:33.375 --> 01:33:35.999
The case of
the disappearance of two girls,

01:33:36.166 --> 01:33:40.332
Angelica Mizera, aged 6, and Kalinka
Jakubek, aged 5, was solved.

01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:43.249
Responsible for
the kidnappings are Maria W.,

01:33:43.416 --> 01:33:47.165
aged 66, and Pawel K., aged 44.

01:33:47.333 --> 01:33:49.665
The girls were held in tunnels,

01:33:49.833 --> 01:33:53.415
accessed from a property
owned by family of Maria W.

01:33:53.583 --> 01:33:55.707
who is currently in custody.

01:33:56.041 --> 01:34:00.124
The second degenerate has been found
dead in an underground tunnel.

01:34:00.291 --> 01:34:02.832
We hope that diligent police work

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:07.082
will solve the case
of his cruel death.

01:34:07.666 --> 01:34:09.957
As we know from
well-informed sources,

01:34:10.125 --> 01:34:12.790
Pawel K. belonged
to an international gang

01:34:12.958 --> 01:34:17.040
profiteering from a particularly
cruel form of child pornography.

01:34:17.375 --> 01:34:19.415
Rapid police response

01:34:19.583 --> 01:34:22.874
only managed to save
the life of Kalinka Jakubek

01:34:23.041 --> 01:34:25.040
who is recovering under the care

01:34:25.208 --> 01:34:26.915
of our best doctors.

01:34:27.541 --> 01:34:31.082
The girl is an orphan from
the 'Angel' orphanage.

01:34:34.875 --> 01:34:36.790
Its director,
Marian Waszkiewicz,

01:34:36.958 --> 01:34:39.124
a distinguished citizen of our city,

01:34:39.291 --> 01:34:42.249
was too upset
to comment the incident.

01:34:42.583 --> 01:34:46.249
He is consoled by his son Marek
who identified the kidnappers.

01:34:47.166 --> 01:34:49.207
The police is making every effort

01:34:49.375 --> 01:34:51.124
to find the third child,

01:34:51.291 --> 01:34:54.499
five-year-old Patryk Milka
from Sobiecin.

01:35:00.416 --> 01:35:02.040
In the event that I...

01:35:02.666 --> 01:35:04.207
don't return home...

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.249
How can I help?

01:35:14.541 --> 01:35:16.040
I have no one left.

01:35:17.916 --> 01:35:19.082
Neither have I.

01:35:23.708 --> 01:35:26.457
Swear to God

01:35:27.125 --> 01:35:29.040
you won't tell anyone.

01:35:29.875 --> 01:35:32.290
- I don't believe in God.
- Oh my.

01:35:33.833 --> 01:35:35.707
She doesn't believe in God.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.707
What do you believe in?

01:35:47.625 --> 01:35:50.540
I believe we should prevent cruelty.

01:35:53.375 --> 01:35:54.749
And do our own thing.

01:36:03.666 --> 01:36:04.666
Fine.

01:36:06.333 --> 01:36:07.333
That will do.

01:36:11.958 --> 01:36:13.832
They are the Katzmans.

01:36:15.083 --> 01:36:16.374
He is a doctor.

01:36:17.333 --> 01:36:18.333
Jürgen.

01:36:21.833 --> 01:36:23.832
Almost like 'Jurek' in Polish.

01:36:25.250 --> 01:36:27.415
Magdalena teaches Polish

01:36:28.333 --> 01:36:30.457
at the university in Berlin.

01:36:32.041 --> 01:36:34.165
She wanted to see my apartment,

01:36:35.291 --> 01:36:36.457
before the war...

01:36:37.958 --> 01:36:39.290
She showed me photos.

01:36:40.666 --> 01:36:42.082
Her grandparents...

01:36:43.041 --> 01:36:44.665
in my dining room.

01:36:48.166 --> 01:36:50.957
They had a common
tongue with Patryk.

01:36:55.375 --> 01:36:57.165
'Do you have kids?' I ask.

01:36:58.333 --> 01:36:59.333
And...

01:37:00.916 --> 01:37:02.124
she starts howling.

01:37:03.416 --> 01:37:04.457
Magdalena.

01:37:06.166 --> 01:37:08.457
She has her eyes in a wet spot.

01:37:10.416 --> 01:37:12.415
They took us on a trip,

01:37:12.791 --> 01:37:14.040
by car,

01:37:14.916 --> 01:37:16.707
to Ksiaz Castle.

01:37:18.208 --> 01:37:20.582
Magdalena was well prepared.

01:37:21.791 --> 01:37:24.249
She told him stuff
about Duchess Daisy,

01:37:24.875 --> 01:37:26.499
about some pearls,

01:37:27.291 --> 01:37:29.749
cat aunts who gave out pearls

01:37:30.291 --> 01:37:32.249
to chosen kids.

01:37:33.083 --> 01:37:35.207
All sorts of nonsense.

01:37:38.416 --> 01:37:40.665
But I'm no dummy.

01:37:42.041 --> 01:37:43.665
I knew they wanted him.

01:37:45.833 --> 01:37:48.082
But it would never happen legally.

01:37:53.375 --> 01:37:55.874
So they took him away
for the holidays.

01:37:56.958 --> 01:37:58.165
And the story...

01:37:59.291 --> 01:38:00.915
with the disappearance...

01:38:01.583 --> 01:38:03.540
I cooked it up.

01:38:08.250 --> 01:38:10.457
They send me photos every week.

01:38:14.833 --> 01:38:15.833
There...

01:38:18.041 --> 01:38:20.040
there's a purse in the drawer.

01:38:20.791 --> 01:38:22.582
In it, there's a key.

01:38:23.875 --> 01:38:24.915
Excuse me?

01:38:25.416 --> 01:38:27.499
Go to my apartment

01:38:28.208 --> 01:38:30.040
and take the photos.

01:38:31.250 --> 01:38:32.624
In the bedroom,

01:38:33.416 --> 01:38:34.999
in the drawer,

01:38:35.791 --> 01:38:36.957
under the sheets.

01:38:38.333 --> 01:38:40.249
No one can find them.

01:38:41.083 --> 01:38:44.165
When I'm dead,
my daughter will surely show up

01:38:44.958 --> 01:38:47.124
to snatch up whatever remains.

01:38:48.416 --> 01:38:49.707
Do you promise?

01:38:55.250 --> 01:38:58.165
I already have.
I'll keep my word.

01:39:10.458 --> 01:39:11.458
There.

01:39:14.791 --> 01:39:17.374
That's the exit from the corridor

01:39:17.541 --> 01:39:19.915
which leads from the forest.

01:39:21.875 --> 01:39:25.540
I checked it a few years ago,
it was still passable.

01:39:28.083 --> 01:39:30.624
Now I'm too old
for such escapades.

01:39:33.416 --> 01:39:34.540
Will you remember?

01:39:39.625 --> 01:39:41.290
I'm old now, Alice.

01:39:42.125 --> 01:39:43.707
I have lived my life.

01:39:46.625 --> 01:39:47.665
I will remember.

01:39:57.791 --> 01:39:59.540
Can I ask you one question?

01:40:00.791 --> 01:40:03.790
I expected nothing
less of a reporter.

01:40:09.458 --> 01:40:11.040
You know where they are?

01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:13.540
The pearls...

01:40:14.333 --> 01:40:15.999
my father was looking for?

01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:27.165
Do you want them?

01:40:28.208 --> 01:40:29.208
No.

01:40:31.083 --> 01:40:32.249
I don't.

01:40:37.791 --> 01:40:38.874
One more thing

01:40:39.666 --> 01:40:41.207
I must tell you about.

01:40:43.416 --> 01:40:45.040
After you were born,

01:40:46.208 --> 01:40:48.624
your mother disappeared for a month.

01:40:49.666 --> 01:40:52.457
She left the hospital
in her maternity gown,

01:40:52.958 --> 01:40:54.957
and came back

01:40:55.125 --> 01:40:56.749
several weeks later.

01:41:14.666 --> 01:41:18.415
Now I think she wanted
someone to take her away.

01:41:18.750 --> 01:41:21.790
She was afraid
to stay with the two of you.

01:41:27.958 --> 01:41:30.624
Anna spent entire
weeks in hospitals.

01:41:31.375 --> 01:41:33.124
They put you in day-care,

01:41:33.791 --> 01:41:36.332
then your sister took care of you.

01:41:47.250 --> 01:41:51.540
Only once in all those years
did I talk to Anna in private.

01:41:52.750 --> 01:41:53.750
Perhaps

01:41:54.416 --> 01:41:56.040
I should say...

01:41:56.541 --> 01:41:57.749
to Rosemarie.

01:42:02.541 --> 01:42:04.082
When they come again...

01:42:16.625 --> 01:42:19.249
be there and save us, please.

01:42:23.833 --> 01:42:24.833
Will you?

01:42:29.333 --> 01:42:30.333
I will.

01:42:33.375 --> 01:42:34.375
I'll be there,

01:42:34.875 --> 01:42:35.915
Rosemarie.

01:42:40.041 --> 01:42:43.332
That night
she wanted to kill you,

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:45.582
when they took her away,

01:42:45.750 --> 01:42:47.665
and the two of you
were sleeping,

01:42:47.833 --> 01:42:49.957
the cat ladies came.

01:43:07.583 --> 01:43:08.874
I haven't seen

01:43:09.416 --> 01:43:11.624
so many of them at once
since the war.

01:43:22.458 --> 01:43:24.249
You grew wild,

01:43:25.125 --> 01:43:26.915
but you handled yourself well.

01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:29.749
I thought it would remain that way,

01:43:30.791 --> 01:43:32.957
as you were safe
without your mother.

01:43:34.250 --> 01:43:35.540
But it turned out

01:43:36.291 --> 01:43:38.874
she became well again.

01:43:40.750 --> 01:43:43.165
Ewa was clever and determined.

01:43:43.666 --> 01:43:46.707
She knew she
couldn't let Anna return,

01:43:47.666 --> 01:43:49.457
because she would bring back

01:43:50.250 --> 01:43:51.707
the cat-eaters.

01:43:54.833 --> 01:43:57.332
The sleeping pills
were very strong.

01:44:12.250 --> 01:44:13.457
Anna fell asleep,

01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:16.707
and Ewa returned home.

01:44:17.625 --> 01:44:19.207
No one noticed anything,

01:44:19.625 --> 01:44:21.249
no one suspected her.

01:44:22.208 --> 01:44:24.457
That's when Ewa wrote the letters.

01:44:25.750 --> 01:44:26.790
Letters,

01:44:27.375 --> 01:44:28.915
because you see,

01:44:29.333 --> 01:44:30.874
there was also an envelope

01:44:31.083 --> 01:44:33.457
addressed to me.

01:44:36.500 --> 01:44:38.207
I had to kill mother.

01:44:40.791 --> 01:44:42.915
I lost the right to stay here.

01:44:44.416 --> 01:44:45.457
To Alice.

01:44:47.083 --> 01:44:48.457
Take care of her.

01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:52.457
When she grows up,
you'll decide what to tell her.

01:44:52.625 --> 01:44:53.665
And when.

01:44:58.458 --> 01:45:02.290
Unfortunately,
your sister was too hasty.

01:45:06.333 --> 01:45:07.707
She never woke up.

01:45:09.833 --> 01:45:10.874
But Anna did.

01:45:16.625 --> 01:45:17.707
Your...

01:45:18.750 --> 01:45:20.374
mother is alive.

01:45:31.625 --> 01:45:34.665
Eats and breathes on her own,
doesn't soil herself.

01:45:34.833 --> 01:45:37.832
But you have to guess
when she needs to go.

01:45:40.375 --> 01:45:42.290
Is this your first time here?

01:45:48.666 --> 01:45:50.040
I sometimes wonder...

01:45:50.833 --> 01:45:52.749
if she thinks about anything.

01:45:55.166 --> 01:45:58.207
I would go crazy
just sitting there like that.

01:46:02.750 --> 01:46:05.915
It's hard to tell
if a person is thinking or not.

01:46:55.916 --> 01:46:56.916
Mom?

01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:04.207
It's me, Alice.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:24.790
I know you don't remember me.

01:47:31.791 --> 01:47:33.832
But I will keep speaking to you

01:47:36.416 --> 01:47:37.540
until you do.

01:49:41.250 --> 01:49:43.040
There's a tempest of us!

01:50:17.458 --> 01:50:20.999
CASTING DIRECTOR

01:50:21.583 --> 01:50:26.790
CO-PRODUCTION
