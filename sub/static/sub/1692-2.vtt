02:12.066 --> 02:13.801
All right already.
Come on.

02:13.835 --> 02:15.503
Step through in here.

02:15.537 --> 02:17.705
Behind the back.
We're going.

02:17.740 --> 02:19.975
Sir, thank you.
That's him.

02:20.009 --> 02:21.910
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

02:21.945 --> 02:23.846
Pardon me.
There he is.

02:23.880 --> 02:26.182
- Keep it moving, folks.
- Torrio, you got a statement?

02:26.216 --> 02:28.751
- Mr. Torrio! - Ask him who
ordered the hit on Colosimo.

02:28.786 --> 02:31.987
Mr. Torrio, is it true the police
questioned you about big Jim's murder?

02:32.022 --> 02:35.024
- We was like brothers, me and Jim.
- Like Cain and Abel?

02:35.144 --> 02:37.408
- ***, alright?
- Back off.

02:37.528 --> 02:40.203
- So why do you think he was killed?
- It was a robbery, how should I know?

02:41.377 --> 02:43.041
Some respect for the dead, huh?

02:43.075 --> 02:45.285
<i>We understand the police
have already spoken with you.</i>

02:45.319 --> 02:47.461
<i>When
did you speak to the police?</i>

02:47.495 --> 02:50.125
<i>All right, a couple steps back.</i>

02:50.159 --> 02:51.446
<i>There we go.
All right.</i>

02:51.480 --> 02:52.921
<i>Come on,
keep it moving here.</i>

02:52.956 --> 02:55.585
Come on, here we go.
Here we go.

03:12.198 --> 03:15.382
- Watch the socks there, eh?
- Yes, sir.

03:20.069 --> 03:21.523
You a family man, Harlan?

03:21.558 --> 03:24.287
Got me a wife and four boys.

03:30.671 --> 03:32.225
- Agent van Alden.
- What?

03:32.260 --> 03:34.924
<i>- To see you.
- Nelson van Alden,</i>

03:34.958 --> 03:38.944
senior prohibition agent,
bureau of internal revenue.

03:40.887 --> 03:43.363
Nucky Thompson.

03:43.398 --> 03:45.794
Shoeshine?
Coffee?

03:45.828 --> 03:47.636
Or something stronger maybe?

03:48.992 --> 03:51.301
Nice that you boys
have a sense of humor.

03:51.323 --> 03:52.944
Have a seat.

04:01.053 --> 04:02.828
You're a difficult man to see.

04:02.862 --> 04:04.704
I've been waiting
since 9:00 A.M.

04:04.738 --> 04:07.436
Well, there's your
mistake right there.

04:07.470 --> 04:10.534
I don't keep regular hours.

04:10.569 --> 04:13.332
That's a little odd for the
county treasurer, isn't it?

04:13.366 --> 04:15.175
Both I and the city of Atlantic

04:15.209 --> 04:17.685
march to our own drummers.

04:23.115 --> 04:24.537
Well, what can I do for you?

04:24.571 --> 04:27.168
I'm investigating
Saturday night's shootings.

04:27.203 --> 04:28.724
What's to investigate?

04:28.758 --> 04:30.466
We can all rest
now that the architect

04:30.501 --> 04:33.731
- of that slaughter's been killed himself.
- Hans Schroeder.

04:33.766 --> 04:35.795
A hun.

04:35.829 --> 04:38.272
Is it any wonder, though...
the level of brutality?

04:38.306 --> 04:41.824
Hans Schroeder
was a baker's apprentice

04:41.859 --> 04:44.722
for the past 11 years.

04:44.757 --> 04:48.320
He has one citation
for public drunkenness...

04:48.355 --> 04:50.751
Octoberfest, 1912.

04:52.140 --> 04:53.682
I wrote that summons myself.

04:53.717 --> 04:55.405
I used to be sheriff here.

04:56.439 --> 04:58.502
He pissed inside
of a moving trolley.

04:58.536 --> 04:59.957
Yet no other criminal record.

04:59.991 --> 05:01.733
Be that as it may,
innocent people

05:01.767 --> 05:04.897
- don't end up dead in fishing nets.
- Not even in Atlantic city?

05:06.608 --> 05:09.572
You know, you really should be
speaking to our current sheriff.

05:09.606 --> 05:13.037
- Your brother Elias.
- That's right.

05:13.071 --> 05:15.434
Hmm.

05:19.521 --> 05:21.296
Have you seen "the Hottentot"?

05:21.331 --> 05:23.473
<i>It's a terrific show.
Laugh a minute.</i>

05:23.507 --> 05:25.215
And if you're stag,
I can certainly

05:25.250 --> 05:27.459
introduce you to some
eligible young ladies.

05:27.493 --> 05:29.335
I don't go in much
for the theater.

05:29.369 --> 05:31.844
Then tell me what you do like.

05:31.879 --> 05:34.409
I stopped by Schroeder's home.

05:34.443 --> 05:35.897
His wife isn't there

05:35.932 --> 05:37.961
do you have any idea
where I might find her?

05:37.995 --> 05:41.026
Correct me if I'm wrong, but your
bailiwick's alcohol, isn't it?

05:41.060 --> 05:43.702
Shouldn't you be out somewhere
raiding another still?

05:43.736 --> 05:48.509
I suppose I march to the beat
of my own drummer as well.

06:01.708 --> 06:04.518
- How the hell did he get in here?
- He was waiting for...

06:04.552 --> 06:06.095
- get my brother on the phone.
- Ja.

06:06.129 --> 06:08.206
- Now.
- Ja.

06:11.960 --> 06:15.091
<i>Citizens, countrymen,</i>

06:15.625 --> 06:19.877
veterans, patriots,
join your white brothers

06:19.912 --> 06:22.775
in the knights
of the Ku Klux Klan.

06:22.810 --> 06:24.785
Here you are.

06:24.820 --> 06:28.071
Sir, take one.

06:28.106 --> 06:29.815
<i>We are a Christian,</i>

06:29.849 --> 06:33.971
<i>fraternal and pro-American
organization governed by...</i>

06:53.018 --> 06:55.419
Thompson.
Mr. Thompson.

06:55.454 --> 06:57.321
Shit.
What's this sap's name again?

06:57.356 --> 07:00.191
It's George Baxt.
He sells cutlery to the restaurants.

07:00.226 --> 07:02.026
Well, if it isn't
good old Baxter.

07:02.061 --> 07:03.528
How's tricks, my friend?

07:03.562 --> 07:04.996
I'm in clover, I tell you.

07:05.030 --> 07:07.565
<i>Business is grand
and I just picked up</i>

07:07.599 --> 07:09.867
this little chippy
down in Baltimore.

07:09.902 --> 07:12.336
Come here, doll.
Say hello to Mr. Thompson.

07:12.371 --> 07:15.773
<i>- Hello. - Her name's Claudia.
She's a shy little thing.</i>

07:15.807 --> 07:18.008
Not especially.
Just sometimes.

07:18.043 --> 07:20.411
You're in good hands with
this one, I'll tell you that.

07:20.445 --> 07:22.613
Thompson's a b cheese,
big as they come.

07:22.647 --> 07:25.282
Some say a big rat.

07:25.317 --> 07:28.252
<i>How about it?
Is he a card</i>

07:28.286 --> 07:31.021
I certainly hope you'll take
in some of our attractions.

07:31.056 --> 07:32.690
We're gonna paint
the town, kiddo.

07:32.724 --> 07:35.859
I wanna go rollerskating.

07:35.893 --> 07:39.229
Well, if you need anything,
you know where to find me.

07:40.198 --> 07:41.932
Your friend's a big shot, huh?

07:41.966 --> 07:44.768
Old Baxy knows 'em all, baby.

07:54.447 --> 07:56.047
Mrs. Schroeder,

07:56.082 --> 07:58.350
there's a Mr. Thompson
here to see you.

07:58.384 --> 08:01.120
Oh.

08:01.154 --> 08:03.389
Yes, please.

08:03.424 --> 08:05.458
I wasn't sure
if you wanted visitors.

08:05.493 --> 08:08.195
I'll need a moment.

08:17.640 --> 08:19.374
It'll just be a minute.

08:19.409 --> 08:21.677
<i>She's just woken up
from her nap.</i>

08:25.683 --> 08:27.918
You can come in now.

08:35.393 --> 08:37.595
Mrs. Schroeder,

08:37.629 --> 08:39.597
Elias Thompson.
I'm the sheriff.

08:39.631 --> 08:42.332
Yes, I know.

08:42.368 --> 08:43.969
Well, you're looking well.

08:44.003 --> 08:47.973
I go home tomorrow,
back to the children.

08:48.008 --> 08:49.608
That's fine.

08:50.878 --> 08:53.914
I wanted to talk to you
about your husband...

08:53.948 --> 08:55.883
late husband...

08:55.917 --> 08:58.352
and his involvement
in illegal alcohol.

09:00.089 --> 09:03.956
He was never in trouble
a day his life,

09:03.990 --> 09:05.756
not in that manner.

09:05.791 --> 09:08.258
The man beat you,
Mrs. Schroeder.

09:08.292 --> 09:11.060
He was not a murderer.

09:12.095 --> 09:13.994
Didn't you just lose a child?

09:17.131 --> 09:20.298
Did you ever follow your husband
when he went out at night?

09:21.899 --> 09:23.299
Of course not.

09:23.333 --> 09:26.133
Question who his friends
were, his associates?

09:26.167 --> 09:28.301
<i>- No.
- Then the fact is</i>

09:28.335 --> 09:30.568
you don't really know
what he was up to

09:30.603 --> 09:33.271
and he could have been
involved in the shootings.

09:34.940 --> 09:39.243
Well, I...
I suppose anything...

09:39.277 --> 09:42.580
then he could have
been involved.

09:42.614 --> 09:45.283
I suppose so.

09:45.317 --> 09:48.353
Then if anyone happens to ask,
that's what you'll tell them.

09:48.387 --> 09:51.556
- I don't see how...
- You have children...

09:51.590 --> 09:54.025
Theodore, Emily?

09:54.059 --> 09:56.060
I'm sure you'd be horrified
if they ended up

09:56.095 --> 09:58.529
in the custody of the county.

09:58.564 --> 10:02.967
Please, I meant no disrespect.

10:03.002 --> 10:05.403
Of course not.

10:11.777 --> 10:15.412
My brother would
like you to have this.

10:15.447 --> 10:18.582
Keep what we discussed
in the forefront of your mind.

10:34.565 --> 10:36.833
<i>Who is he, the Mayor?</i>

10:36.868 --> 10:40.170
He's the county treasurer,
but he lives like a pharaoh...

10:40.205 --> 10:42.172
the entire eighth floor
of the Ritz.

10:42.207 --> 10:43.941
All at the public's expense.

10:43.975 --> 10:47.011
<i>Grand furniture,
crystal vases,</i>

10:47.045 --> 10:49.781
<i>oil paintings,
tailored suits.</i>

10:49.815 --> 10:53.251
<i>Drives a Rolls-Royce too.
At least his chauffeur does.</i>

10:53.286 --> 10:55.120
<i>He's corrupt
as the day is long.</i>

10:55.154 --> 10:57.423
<i>And I'm not just talking
about a little graft.</i>

10:57.457 --> 11:00.359
There isn't a single business
he doesn't get a piece of.

11:00.394 --> 11:02.261
Hey!

11:02.295 --> 11:03.429
- Huh?
- Fleming.

11:03.463 --> 11:05.531
- What do you say, huh?
- Two coffees.

11:05.566 --> 11:07.500
<i>Nor a public employee</i>

11:07.534 --> 11:09.669
who doesn't pay for the right
to hold his job.

11:09.703 --> 11:13.272
<i>His aldermen make the collections,
then fill his coffers every week.</i>

11:13.307 --> 11:16.209
- Nucky.
- Look who's here.

11:16.244 --> 11:17.811
- For the ice fund.
- Of course.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.146
- Thank you.
- Oh, thank you.

11:19.180 --> 11:20.815
<i>Sanitation, police...</i>

11:20.849 --> 11:22.750
<i>- Right on time.
- ...Fire department.</i>

11:22.785 --> 11:24.252
The envelope catch on fire?

11:24.286 --> 11:26.722
<i>He's got the entire
town paying off.</i>

11:26.756 --> 11:28.324
Yet they still vote him in.

11:28.358 --> 11:31.525
The people love him,
the darkies especially.

11:31.559 --> 11:34.962
Remember, gentlemen, to vote
excessively but smoke moderately.

11:34.996 --> 11:37.231
<i>Every waiter,
busboy and Porter</i>

11:37.265 --> 11:39.500
<i>swears allegiance to him
come election time.</i>

11:39.535 --> 11:41.770
<i>And that's just
the tip of the iceberg.</i>

11:41.804 --> 11:44.506
<i>- No more bets.
- Casis,</i>

11:44.540 --> 11:47.208
<i>whorehouses...</i>

11:47.243 --> 11:49.611
<i>even owns a wire service
for the racing results.</i>

11:49.645 --> 11:51.212
White shadow in the fifth.

11:51.247 --> 11:54.348
<i>- And alcohol?
- It hasn't slowed down a bit.</i>

11:54.382 --> 11:57.350
<i>There's hardly a bar or a restaurant
where you can't get a drink.</i>

11:57.384 --> 11:59.417
<i>It's practically
out in the open.</i>

11:59.452 --> 12:03.487
You went down to Atlantic city following
Arnold Rothstein. What about him?

12:03.521 --> 12:05.650
Frankly, sir,
I'm beginning to think

12:05.685 --> 12:08.750
Nucky Thompson
is the bigger fish.

12:10.984 --> 12:13.550
How did she seem?
Was she in good spirits?

12:13.584 --> 12:15.618
She took the money,
if that's what you mean.

12:15.653 --> 12:17.553
A little defensive
about the husband.

12:17.588 --> 12:20.456
You should've dumped him like I told
you... side of the road somewhere.

12:20.490 --> 12:23.125
- "Get rid of him," is what you said.
- I meant publicly

12:23.159 --> 12:25.526
- so he could be identified.
- He was identified.

12:25.561 --> 12:27.528
The fish could have
ate his face off, Eli.

12:27.562 --> 12:29.296
He could have drifted
to nova Scotia.

12:29.330 --> 12:31.531
Use your noodle next time, eh?

12:33.534 --> 12:35.635
I'll be up front.

12:43.309 --> 12:45.877
Mickey.

12:45.911 --> 12:47.478
Mickey, wake up.

12:54.552 --> 12:56.185
Jesus.

12:56.220 --> 12:58.887
<i>- What fucking took you so long?
- You're out, Mickey.</i>

12:58.922 --> 13:01.825
So long, sucker.

13:01.859 --> 13:04.396
See youse in the funny papers.

13:04.430 --> 13:06.132
Not out of jail,
out of business.

13:06.166 --> 13:07.934
Chalky White's taking over.

13:07.969 --> 13:11.139
What are you
talking about? Why?

13:11.173 --> 13:13.409
You broke the cardinal rule, Mickey.
You got caught.

13:13.443 --> 13:15.912
That was a set-up.
The fix was in from the beginning.

13:15.946 --> 13:18.850
Shut the fuck up!

13:18.885 --> 13:21.221
- What am I supposed to tell my partners?
- Tell them whatever you'd like.

13:21.255 --> 13:24.426
The feds know who you are now, Mickey.
You're contagious.

13:24.461 --> 13:26.763
- So you'll bail me out at least?
- No can do.

13:26.797 --> 13:28.599
I can't risk them
tying us together.

13:28.633 --> 13:32.604
So you're just gonna leave
me in here with slanty-eyes?

13:34.140 --> 13:35.874
He don't even talk English!

13:35.908 --> 13:39.077
Think of it as a way
to broaden your horizons.

13:39.112 --> 13:40.612
<i>Nucky!</i>

13:50.623 --> 13:52.223
Go ahead.

13:54.093 --> 13:56.260
Surprise!

13:56.295 --> 13:59.063
Merry Christmas.
Ho ho ho ho.

13:59.098 --> 14:01.132
Merry Christmas,
merry Christmas.

14:01.166 --> 14:03.468
<i>- Mwah!
- What is this?</i>

14:03.502 --> 14:05.470
It's Christmas.
What does it look like?

14:05.504 --> 14:07.171
It was Christmas
over a month ago.

14:07.206 --> 14:08.806
Yeah, but not
like this, it wasn't.

14:08.841 --> 14:10.942
Oh my God, what did you do?

14:10.976 --> 14:12.477
Nucky gave me a bonus.

14:12.511 --> 14:14.779
I mean, why wait
till next year, right?

14:14.814 --> 14:17.916
The tree... I found it in the
alley around the corner.

14:17.951 --> 14:20.718
Say, pal, what do
you think of this?

14:26.458 --> 14:28.593
- Rip it.
- Here, I'll help you.

14:28.627 --> 14:30.194
Truck!

14:30.229 --> 14:32.430
<i>That's right.</i>

14:33.933 --> 14:35.900
Truck.

14:35.934 --> 14:38.669
Truck.

14:41.173 --> 14:42.706
For you.

14:42.740 --> 14:44.941
What is it?

14:49.847 --> 14:51.747
Oh my God.

14:54.084 --> 14:55.851
Jimmy, this must
have cost $100.

14:55.885 --> 14:58.887
- Do you like it?
- Yes, of course.

14:58.921 --> 15:00.889
Then let me worry
about the cost.

15:00.924 --> 15:03.759
Here, and this one too.

15:03.793 --> 15:06.128
Tada.

15:06.162 --> 15:07.663
Is that a vacuum sweeper?

15:07.697 --> 15:10.766
The fella said he can
bare keep them in stock.

15:10.800 --> 15:13.268
Here, plug it in.

15:17.673 --> 15:20.841
Mommy, mommy, mommy.

15:20.875 --> 15:24.077
<i>It's a noise.</i>

15:24.111 --> 15:26.512
Don't worry,
it's not gonna hurt you.

15:26.547 --> 15:29.316
Come on, buddy.

15:29.350 --> 15:32.485
Tommy, look.

15:32.519 --> 15:34.820
Look, it's a vacuum sweeper.

15:34.855 --> 15:36.321
You see?

15:36.356 --> 15:38.156
Someone's very tired.

16:17.207 --> 16:21.877
Mr. Rothstein, Charlie
Luciano to see you.

16:28.351 --> 16:30.719
We've got a special guest.

16:33.389 --> 16:36.458
- Frankie Yale.
How are you? - A.R.

16:36.492 --> 16:39.394
I understand you just
got back from Chicago.

16:39.429 --> 16:41.363
That's why you brung me here?

16:41.397 --> 16:43.665
I asked him to, Frankie.

16:43.700 --> 16:46.167
I was visiting
a friend. So what?

16:46.202 --> 16:53.301
It was a lousy visit
though, huh?

16:54.363 --> 16:56.230
Help yourself.

17:12.211 --> 17:14.746
There was a man once...

17:14.780 --> 17:17.714
I don't recall his name...

17:17.749 --> 17:20.784
frequented the billiard
parlors downtown.

17:24.222 --> 17:25.888
<i>He made
a comfortable living</i>

17:25.924 --> 17:28.523
wagering whether he could
swallow certain objects,

17:28.559 --> 17:30.693
billiard balls
being a specialty.

17:30.727 --> 17:32.161
He'd pick a ball,

17:32.195 --> 17:34.062
take it down
his gullet to here,

17:34.097 --> 17:38.667
then regurgitate it back up.

17:40.502 --> 17:44.838
And one evening I decided to
challenge this man to a wager...

17:44.873 --> 17:47.140
10,000 in cash for him
to do the trick

17:47.174 --> 17:49.274
with a billiard ball
of my choosing.

17:50.510 --> 17:54.279
Now he knew I'd seen him
do this a dozen times,

17:54.313 --> 17:57.548
so I can only surmise that
he thought I was stupid.

17:59.117 --> 18:03.453
We laid down the cash and I
handed him the cue ball.

18:03.487 --> 18:05.688
He swallowed it down.

18:05.722 --> 18:08.791
It lodged in his throat

18:08.825 --> 18:11.193
and he choked to death
on the spot.

18:12.595 --> 18:15.361
What I knew and he didn't
was that the cue ball

18:15.396 --> 18:18.231
was 1/16th of an inch larger
than the other balls...

18:18.265 --> 18:21.434
just too large to swallow.

18:31.744 --> 18:35.579
Do you know what the moral
of this tale is, Mr. Yale?

18:35.614 --> 18:37.481
Don't eat a cue ball?

18:40.551 --> 18:43.652
The moral of this story

18:43.687 --> 18:45.354
is that if I'd cause a stranger

18:45.388 --> 18:48.056
to choke to death
for my own amusement,

18:48.090 --> 18:49.691
what do you think
I'll do to you

18:49.725 --> 18:52.826
if you don't tell me who
ordered you to kill Colosimo?

19:21.919 --> 19:25.322
Jimmy honey,

19:25.356 --> 19:27.625
it's not a good time.

19:29.227 --> 19:32.131
I don't mind.

19:32.165 --> 19:34.333
Let's do something else.

19:44.511 --> 19:47.280
Maybe...

19:47.314 --> 19:51.184
maybe we could, you know,
do it the French way.

19:51.218 --> 19:52.819
What?

19:54.588 --> 19:58.222
Well, when we were
outside Paris,

19:58.257 --> 20:02.692
some fellas were talking about
some gals they met that...

20:03.994 --> 20:08.529
Oh, you want me to put
my mouth down there?

20:38.393 --> 20:42.662
There were so many times
when I would think of you.

20:42.696 --> 20:45.065
I would get so hard.

20:49.370 --> 20:51.510
<i>- Mama, mama.
- God damn it!</i>

20:51.545 --> 20:53.953
- It's okay.
- Shit.

20:53.988 --> 20:55.522
<i>Mama, where are you?</i>

20:55.556 --> 20:58.058
<i>- Mama's right here, baby.
- I can't find you.</i>

20:58.092 --> 21:00.926
<i>The kid's
got timing, huh?</i>

21:03.864 --> 21:05.298
Are you hungry?

21:05.332 --> 21:08.034
You want me to fix you a steak?

21:08.068 --> 21:11.037
No, I gotta do something.

21:14.141 --> 21:18.244
<i>We now take
you to ancient Greece!</i>

21:29.289 --> 21:31.723
<i>Behold the sirens,</i>

21:31.757 --> 21:35.093
the stunning temptresses
who, in their wickedness,

21:35.127 --> 21:40.231
<i>enticed Odysseus to dash
himself upon the rocks.</i>

21:50.143 --> 21:52.611
Cue the waves crashing.

21:55.048 --> 21:57.015
Sound, that's your cue!

21:57.050 --> 21:59.885
<i>Sound!</i>

21:59.919 --> 22:02.321
Let's break.

22:02.355 --> 22:05.656
<i>Five minutes.</i>

22:07.793 --> 22:09.560
<i>I'm really .</i>

22:09.594 --> 22:11.830
<i>- You want a something?
- Sure.</i>

22:11.864 --> 22:15.334
<i>Yeah.</i>

22:19.172 --> 22:21.506
Jimmy!

22:21.540 --> 22:23.008
Oh!

22:23.042 --> 22:26.611
Oh, baby baby baby.

22:29.816 --> 22:33.486
Jimmy.

22:33.520 --> 22:35.422
Oh, my baby.

22:35.456 --> 22:38.392
- Ma, it's all right.
- Baby baby baby.

22:39.995 --> 22:42.630
Why didn't you write?
I thought you were dead.

22:42.665 --> 22:44.766
I'm fine.

22:46.068 --> 22:49.771
I missed you so much.
I missed you, I did.

22:50.907 --> 22:53.509
It's all right.
Come on.

22:53.543 --> 22:56.145
Oh my God, I'm shaking.

22:56.179 --> 22:58.214
When did you come home?

22:58.248 --> 23:00.516
I've been home
over a month now.

23:00.551 --> 23:03.552
And you're just
coming to see me now?

23:03.587 --> 23:05.287
I've been busy.

23:05.321 --> 23:07.922
Come on, put on some clothes.

23:14.830 --> 23:16.931
Oh, I...

23:18.267 --> 23:20.368
I got you something.

23:22.838 --> 23:25.106
What is this?

23:30.946 --> 23:33.547
Oh.

23:36.518 --> 23:38.552
Jimmy.

23:38.587 --> 23:40.620
It's okay.
Come on, ma.

23:40.655 --> 23:42.956
This is it.
This is the one.

23:42.990 --> 23:44.557
It's close.
It's very similar.

23:44.591 --> 23:46.092
Oh.

23:46.126 --> 23:50.630
I had the same necklace
years ago from his father.

23:50.664 --> 23:53.200
I don't have a father.

23:53.234 --> 23:56.270
She sold it to keep
a roof over my head.

23:56.304 --> 23:58.206
She's a good egg, your mom.

23:58.240 --> 24:00.909
I promised you I'd
replace it, didn't I?

24:03.046 --> 24:06.717
Just having you back...

24:06.751 --> 24:09.053
I don't know what to say.

24:34.845 --> 24:36.812
What are you doing?

24:36.846 --> 24:39.881
It's 4:30.

24:39.916 --> 24:41.516
I'm clocking in.

24:41.550 --> 24:43.951
Just like that?

24:43.986 --> 24:46.019
I'd say our relationship
has changed

24:46.054 --> 24:49.521
rather significantly in the past few days.
Wouldn't you agree?

24:53.359 --> 24:56.527
- You tell me.
- Actually, why don't you tell me?

24:56.561 --> 24:59.363
You can start with what the
fuck happened the other night.

24:59.398 --> 25:02.799
- How's that?
- All right.

25:04.635 --> 25:06.636
Did I invite you to sit?

25:11.408 --> 25:13.608
Me and Al, we got
to thinking about life...

25:13.643 --> 25:16.344
- who's Al? - Capone.
He works for Johnny Torrio.

25:16.378 --> 25:18.477
- The chubby kid?
- Yeah.

25:18.512 --> 25:20.780
<i>- Did Torrio sanction this?
- Only after the fact.</i>

25:20.814 --> 25:23.015
It was my idea...
mine and Al's.

25:23.050 --> 25:25.418
We got to talking about
life, family, money.

25:25.453 --> 25:28.055
<i>- He's got a little boy of his own.
- Young children at home</i>

25:28.089 --> 25:30.791
and there's no goddamn
accountability whatsoever.

25:30.825 --> 25:33.260
- I said I was sorry, Nuck.
- Really?

25:33.295 --> 25:35.429
When was that?

25:35.463 --> 25:37.998
I'm sorry.

25:38.032 --> 25:39.666
I thought it would
be easy, okay?

25:39.700 --> 25:41.468
Get the drop on them,
swipe the truck.

25:41.502 --> 25:43.837
- No one would get hurt.
- And me? Where'd I figure in?

25:43.871 --> 25:46.740
<i>- It would have never been traced back to you.
- Oh well, guess what.</i>

25:46.774 --> 25:49.943
A fed came in to see me this morning,
standing right where you are now,

25:49.977 --> 25:51.945
<i>asking questions
about Saturday night.</i>

25:51.979 --> 25:54.514
- What'd you tell him? - To bugger himself.
What the fuck do you think?

25:54.549 --> 25:56.216
There were deer in the woods.

25:56.251 --> 25:58.185
Al got spooked.
He started shooting.

25:58.219 --> 25:59.853
So you kill four fucking guys?

25:59.888 --> 26:01.822
- Five.
- Actually, there were four,

26:01.856 --> 26:04.624
<i>but let's not quibble over
that little detail, shall we?</i>

26:04.659 --> 26:06.627
We couldn't leave
any witnesses, Nuck.

26:06.661 --> 26:08.962
Fucking idiot.

26:08.996 --> 26:11.597
I screwed up, okay?
I'm sorry.

26:11.632 --> 26:14.066
I'm gonna make it up to you.
I'll work extra hours.

26:14.101 --> 26:16.502
Hold on there. Wait a second.
You don't work for me anymore.

26:16.536 --> 26:18.170
Let's get that
straight right now.

26:18.204 --> 26:19.905
And you made
that decision, not me.

26:19.939 --> 26:22.774
- Well, who's gonna drive you?
- What's the difference?

26:22.808 --> 26:25.510
Wanna be a gangster, kid?
Go be a gangster.

26:25.544 --> 26:27.511
But if you want to be
a gangster in my town,

26:27.546 --> 26:30.114
then you'll pay me
for the privilege.

26:32.083 --> 26:34.884
That envelope
you gave me, my end...

26:34.918 --> 26:37.786
you're three grand short.

26:37.821 --> 26:40.355
- What do you mean?
- Are you deaf and stupid?

26:40.390 --> 26:43.324
You pull a stunt like that,
ass-fuck me with Arnold Rothstein

26:43.359 --> 26:45.593
in the process, you owe me
another three grand.

26:45.628 --> 26:47.195
Nucky, I spent
most of the money.

26:47.229 --> 26:50.097
$3,000.
You got 48 hours.

27:25.364 --> 27:27.264
What'll it be?

27:27.299 --> 27:30.435
I'll take a whiskey and a
statement on the record.

27:30.469 --> 27:31.970
How's that?

27:32.004 --> 27:35.140
Eddie Corrigan, "Chicago tribune.
" I believe we already met.

27:35.174 --> 27:39.511
- You drinking or what?
- Whiskey, like I said.

27:39.545 --> 27:42.347
Three bucks.

27:42.381 --> 27:45.183
- What's your name?
- Al brown.

27:49.221 --> 27:51.655
Hit me again.

27:53.358 --> 27:55.726
I'm going with a story
linking Johnny Torrio

27:55.761 --> 27:57.862
to the big Jim murder.

27:57.897 --> 27:59.631
Why would you do that?

27:59.665 --> 28:02.234
Because I think it's true.

28:02.268 --> 28:04.936
Would you like
to make a statement?

28:06.638 --> 28:08.740
Sure.

28:21.256 --> 28:23.023
What the fuck's going on?

28:23.057 --> 28:25.024
I'm making a statement.

28:38.105 --> 28:40.707
Arnold Rothstein again.

28:43.411 --> 28:45.847
Put on a black suit.
You'll be driving me tonight.

28:45.881 --> 28:48.784
Shall I wear a
chauffeur's cap as well?

28:48.819 --> 28:51.654
- If you want.
- Well, I have to borrow one then.

28:51.689 --> 28:53.656
Well then borrow one.
Or don't.

28:53.691 --> 28:55.325
What are you asking me for?

28:55.359 --> 28:57.761
The chauffeur must have a cap.

29:00.432 --> 29:02.100
Hello?

29:02.134 --> 29:05.770
<i>Nucky,
Arnold Rothstein.</i>

29:05.804 --> 29:07.505
What a pleasant surprise.

29:07.539 --> 29:09.174
Yeah, I'm sure.

29:09.208 --> 29:12.444
So the reason
I've been calling...

29:12.479 --> 29:16.316
the delivery I arranged,
I never received it.

29:16.350 --> 29:17.651
You don't say.

29:17.685 --> 29:20.153
<i>The truck ran out of petrol.
Who knows?</i>

29:20.188 --> 29:22.322
We'll chalk it up
to a misunderstanding.

29:22.357 --> 29:24.291
Chalk it up however you'd like.

29:24.325 --> 29:25.592
Fine.

29:25.626 --> 29:27.660
Then 100 grand should cover it.

29:27.695 --> 29:29.062
Excuse me?

29:29.096 --> 29:32.866
<i>You owe me $100,000,
Mr. Thompson.</i>

29:32.900 --> 29:36.803
It's bad enough you sold
my load to Chicago.

29:36.838 --> 29:40.807
My sister-in-law's nephew
was one of those drivers.

29:40.841 --> 29:42.776
I didn't sell
your load to anyone,

29:42.810 --> 29:45.412
and I don't care if your mother
was one of the drivers.

29:45.446 --> 29:47.180
Is this the way
you do business?

29:47.215 --> 29:48.682
You wanna see
how I do business?

29:48.716 --> 29:51.284
Show your face again
in Atlantic city.

30:16.778 --> 30:19.013
Shit.

30:26.155 --> 30:29.390
Jimmy?

30:29.425 --> 30:32.193
Go back to sleep.

30:32.227 --> 30:34.562
What are you doing?

30:35.764 --> 30:39.400
Nothing, I'm...
I'm getting something.

30:39.435 --> 30:42.904
Is everything all right?

30:42.938 --> 30:44.539
Go back to sleep.

30:44.573 --> 30:47.041
You're gonna wake the baby.

32:08.673 --> 32:11.674
<i>- Mrs. Schroeder?
- Hello?</i>

32:11.708 --> 32:13.509
<i>I'm Nelson van Alden.</i>

32:13.543 --> 32:15.477
I'm with the bureau
of internal revenue.

32:15.512 --> 32:17.979
I'd like to speak to you
about your husband.

32:26.054 --> 32:27.654
Please.

32:32.759 --> 32:35.661
Is this a bad time?

32:35.695 --> 32:37.796
I'm just back
from the hospital.

32:37.830 --> 32:39.998
Oh, I didn't realize.

32:43.201 --> 32:45.236
Please.

32:50.941 --> 32:52.808
Sit.

33:24.902 --> 33:27.470
First of all, my condolences.

33:27.504 --> 33:31.073
I'm sure your husband
was a fine and decent man.

33:35.077 --> 33:37.078
I realize this is cold comfort,

33:37.113 --> 33:38.579
but I have reason to believe

33:38.614 --> 33:42.116
that his murder is unrelated

33:42.150 --> 33:44.684
to any alleged ties
to bootlegging.

33:44.719 --> 33:46.820
I... I don't understand.

33:46.854 --> 33:49.255
He was a patsy,
Mrs. Schroeder,

33:49.289 --> 33:51.824
a dupe set up to take the fall.

33:51.858 --> 33:55.393
- By whom?
- I'm not sure yet.

33:55.427 --> 33:58.462
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- Please.

34:03.467 --> 34:07.537
I, um...
I had a ribbon.

34:07.571 --> 34:11.706
What exactly is the nature of your
relationship to nucky Thompson?

34:26.157 --> 34:28.725
- Hey, Nuck.
- Hey, champ.

34:28.759 --> 34:30.860
Say, can you lend me
a few bucks?

34:30.893 --> 34:33.396
I'd like to,
but I'm a little short.

34:33.429 --> 34:36.132
That one kills me!

34:38.467 --> 34:40.136
Oh, look at the lovebirds.

34:40.170 --> 34:41.637
Looks like you're
having a ball.

34:41.670 --> 34:43.371
We're having
a swell time, sure.

34:43.407 --> 34:46.509
Saltwater Taffy!
Would you like some?

34:46.543 --> 34:50.545
No, but you go ahead.

34:56.887 --> 34:58.821
Talk about a flat tire.

34:58.855 --> 35:02.925
Lionel Barrymore last night,
dinner at the knife & fork,

35:02.959 --> 35:05.227
champagne till dawn
and not so much as a smooch.

35:05.262 --> 35:07.930
- She looks like a push-over.
- That's what I thought.

35:10.300 --> 35:12.501
What are you, about 20, 21?

35:12.535 --> 35:14.603
Oh, forgive me for asking.

35:14.638 --> 35:17.640
- It's just that George and
I were talking. - I'm 19.

35:17.674 --> 35:19.842
Why, that's ideal.

35:19.876 --> 35:22.411
You see, I'm thinking of
sponsoring a beauty contest

35:22.445 --> 35:23.912
right here in Atlantic city.

35:23.947 --> 35:25.681
And if you don't
mind my saying,

35:25.715 --> 35:29.318
- you've got plenty of what it takes.
- A beauty contest?

35:29.352 --> 35:31.086
Naturally.
Who doesn't love a pretty girl?

35:31.120 --> 35:34.356
- What would I have to do?
- Keep in touch and I'll let you know.

35:34.390 --> 35:37.292
Oh, incidentally, Georgie here
will be one of our judges.

35:37.327 --> 35:39.828
- Really?
- Certainly.

35:39.862 --> 35:42.597
- Thanks, Nuck. You're the darb.
- That oughtta warm her up.

35:51.841 --> 35:54.521
<i>Hello?
Atlantic city, new Jersey,</i>

35:54.555 --> 35:56.223
<i>to Chicago, Illinois.</i>

35:56.257 --> 35:59.259
It took you long enough.
I've been waiting a half-hour.

35:59.294 --> 36:01.728
<i>Go ahead, please.</i>

36:01.762 --> 36:03.363
Hello?

36:05.733 --> 36:09.469
<i>Al. Al.</i>

36:09.503 --> 36:12.539
<i>- Come here.
- Hello? Is anyone there?</i>

36:12.573 --> 36:14.040
Who's this?

36:14.075 --> 36:16.309
Al, it's Jimmy.

36:16.343 --> 36:19.412
<i>- Jim Darmody.
- Who?</i>

36:19.447 --> 36:20.914
Jimmy, Atlantic city.

36:20.948 --> 36:22.315
What gives?

36:22.349 --> 36:24.384
<i>I'm in a fix.
I need your help.</i>

36:24.418 --> 36:26.019
What kind of fix?
The coppers?

36:26.053 --> 36:28.521
No, it's not that.

36:28.555 --> 36:30.056
I-I need money.

36:30.090 --> 36:31.858
You blew all that dough
already?

36:31.892 --> 36:34.927
It's a long story.

36:34.962 --> 36:37.363
I need you to wire me $500.

36:39.533 --> 36:41.400
What?
I didn't hear you.

36:41.435 --> 36:43.869
I need you to go
to Western union

36:43.904 --> 36:45.705
<i>and wire me $500.</i>

36:45.739 --> 36:48.107
I can't hear you, pal.

36:48.141 --> 36:50.142
<i>There's trouble
on the wire.</i>

36:50.177 --> 36:51.610
Al.

36:51.645 --> 36:53.512
Jimmy?
Jimmy, are you there?

36:53.546 --> 36:55.781
<i>- Al, can you hear me?
- I can't hear you.</i>

36:55.815 --> 36:57.783
- Al!
- Call me back, pal.

36:57.817 --> 37:00.219
Sounds like you need help.

37:01.755 --> 37:04.190
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

37:04.224 --> 37:06.459
<i>Al!</i>

37:06.493 --> 37:08.361
<i>Operator.
May I help you?</i>

37:08.395 --> 37:12.331
Yeah, you... you can go jump
in a fucking lake.

37:16.803 --> 37:19.471
Why is the money cold?

37:19.505 --> 37:22.507
<i>- It was in my pocket.
- You walked here?</i>

37:22.542 --> 37:24.242
I let Jimmy go.

37:24.277 --> 37:27.512
<i>It's time he struck
out on his own.</i>

37:27.547 --> 37:30.782
Well, maybe it'll
be good for him,

37:30.817 --> 37:33.051
<i>toughen him up
a little bit.</i>

37:33.085 --> 37:36.288
Pour me one of those
cognacs, will you?

37:36.322 --> 37:38.190
Fuckin' indigestion.

37:38.224 --> 37:41.526
<i>- You and me both.
- Stomach's been killing me.</i>

37:41.561 --> 37:43.862
So what do you hear
from Trenton?

37:43.896 --> 37:45.497
<i>Senator edge
is coming down,</i>

37:45.531 --> 37:48.099
Frank Hague too
from Jersey city,

37:48.134 --> 37:50.001
for my birthday.

37:50.036 --> 37:51.803
Oh Jesus.

37:51.837 --> 37:54.472
A grown man still throwing
himself birthdays.

37:54.507 --> 37:57.175
<i>Does that mean I
should cancel your cooze for the night?</i>

37:57.209 --> 37:58.977
The fuck it does.

38:00.613 --> 38:03.715
I'm hoping to pin edge down on
that road appropriation money.

38:03.749 --> 38:06.184
You should horse-trade.
The election's coming up.

38:06.218 --> 38:08.086
He's got his eye on Washington.

38:08.120 --> 38:09.687
I think he can go all the way.

38:09.722 --> 38:12.890
- God knows the ladies like him.
- Yeah.

38:12.925 --> 38:16.961
- That could be a lot of goddamn votes.
- That's a frightening thought.

38:18.397 --> 38:21.065
Well, a vote's a vote,
isn't it?

38:21.100 --> 38:23.200
You think so?

38:26.271 --> 38:27.871
Louanne.

38:29.941 --> 38:32.042
Louanne?

38:34.012 --> 38:36.747
God damn it.

38:38.416 --> 38:40.884
Louanne.

38:49.293 --> 38:51.795
Jesus. What the hell are
you doing back there?

38:51.829 --> 38:53.263
Fixing your supper,
commodore...

38:53.297 --> 38:55.332
when you hear this bell,
get your ass in here.

38:55.366 --> 38:58.301
- Do you understand that?
- Yes, sir.

38:58.336 --> 39:00.337
Is there something
I could do for you?

39:00.372 --> 39:03.173
I want you to tell
Mr. Thompson here

39:03.208 --> 39:06.110
what your thoughts are
on the league of nations.

39:06.144 --> 39:07.878
Beg pardon?

39:07.912 --> 39:09.913
Tell Mr. Thompson
what your thoughts are

39:09.948 --> 39:11.548
on the league of nations.

39:13.051 --> 39:15.252
Big meeting there
last week, right?

39:15.286 --> 39:16.720
Paris?

39:16.754 --> 39:19.589
I don't know what that is, sir.

39:19.623 --> 39:24.427
Well, how do you feel
about the Harriday act?

39:24.462 --> 39:26.996
- Holiday?
- Harriday.

39:27.031 --> 39:30.733
Allows banks to operate
through subsidiaries.

39:30.768 --> 39:33.603
Sorry, commodore,

39:33.637 --> 39:36.506
I'm not versed
in these matters.

39:36.540 --> 39:40.576
Of course she isn't.
She empties my pisspot.

39:52.356 --> 39:55.424
That's your woman's vote.

39:58.862 --> 40:01.931
<i>We now take
you to feudal Japan!</i>

40:01.965 --> 40:03.599
- Come on, come on!
- Aw, Jesus.

40:03.633 --> 40:05.401
- What are you waiting for!
- That's us.

40:05.435 --> 40:07.036
- The cue's coming.
- Come on, let's go.

40:08.439 --> 40:12.276
- It happens every time.
- Yeah.

40:32.831 --> 40:37.034
<i>"My dearest rose,</i>

40:37.069 --> 40:40.938
<i>I trust and pray
to our lord</i>

40:40.972 --> 40:44.342
<i>that this missive
finds you well</i>

40:44.376 --> 40:46.744
<i>and in good spirits.</i>

40:48.279 --> 40:50.781
<i>Important agency business</i>

40:50.816 --> 40:53.217
<i>keeps me from home,</i>

40:53.251 --> 40:57.088
<i>for how much longer
I cannot say.</i>

40:58.957 --> 41:00.891
<i>Please see to it</i>

41:00.925 --> 41:05.462
<i>that you run the faucets
at least twice a day,</i>

41:05.496 --> 41:10.432
<i>as the winter weather
can cause the pipes to crack.</i>

41:13.036 --> 41:17.105
<i>Your devoted husband,</i>

41:17.139 --> 41:19.407
<i>Nelson."</i>

42:43.590 --> 42:45.224
Whoa.

42:45.258 --> 42:46.692
Shoe.

43:04.476 --> 43:08.079
You know, you oughtta
grow a mustache.

43:08.113 --> 43:10.248
What?

43:10.282 --> 43:12.216
Sure.

43:12.251 --> 43:14.886
Like Douglas Fairbanks.

43:14.920 --> 43:17.022
Douglas Fairbanks
belongs in snake alley

43:17.056 --> 43:18.523
with the other powder puffs.

43:18.557 --> 43:21.960
You ask me, he's all man.

43:21.994 --> 43:25.230
<i>He's starring
in "the mark of Zorro."</i>

43:25.264 --> 43:27.632
<i>I'll put that on my list.</i>

43:27.667 --> 43:30.535
Ahem, Mrs. Schroeder
is here.

43:30.570 --> 43:34.539
- Now?
- She says she must see you.

43:42.281 --> 43:44.416
Who's Mrs. Schroeder?

43:45.551 --> 43:47.152
Just wait in the car
with Eddie.

43:52.492 --> 43:54.626
Mrs. Schroeder,
what a surprise.

43:54.661 --> 43:56.395
I'm sorry.
I know it's late.

43:56.429 --> 43:59.231
It's nearly midnight.
Where are your children?

43:59.265 --> 44:01.466
They're with a neighbor.

44:02.735 --> 44:05.136
Shall we?

44:09.141 --> 44:11.241
Here, have a seat.

44:20.951 --> 44:25.287
Mr. Thompson,
I apologize,

44:25.322 --> 44:27.288
but I need to return this.

44:28.657 --> 44:31.392
Well, that certainly could
have waited till tomorrow.

44:31.427 --> 44:35.096
No, it couldn't.

44:35.131 --> 44:37.532
That money...

44:37.566 --> 44:41.269
I don't know what it is,
what it's for.

44:41.303 --> 44:43.805
It was weighing too heavily
on my conscience.

44:43.839 --> 44:46.107
Your conscience?

44:46.142 --> 44:48.309
Well, why should it do that?

44:53.549 --> 44:56.884
With my husband gone...

45:00.456 --> 45:02.624
I understand what
you're going through,

45:02.658 --> 45:05.460
whatever the circumstances.

45:07.998 --> 45:12.168
Was she very young, your wife?

45:14.672 --> 45:17.140
Yes, she was.

45:17.175 --> 45:19.343
28.

45:21.012 --> 45:25.249
She was a beautiful
loving woman.

45:25.283 --> 45:27.985
I'll keep her in my prayers.

45:28.019 --> 45:30.721
Thank you.

45:32.590 --> 45:35.259
When I came to you for help,

45:35.293 --> 45:40.130
it was only to ask
for employment for my husband.

45:40.165 --> 45:42.633
I was a parlormaid
back in Ireland.

45:42.667 --> 45:44.835
With these soft hand

45:48.807 --> 45:51.709
my point is I wasn't
seeking alms.

45:51.743 --> 45:54.845
But we're christians.
That was the charitable thing.

45:54.879 --> 45:57.447
Charity degrades
those who receive it

45:57.482 --> 46:01.351
and hardens those
who dispense it.

46:01.386 --> 46:05.022
That's French or something, isn't it?

46:05.056 --> 46:07.924
- George sand.
- He was a poet.

46:07.959 --> 46:11.094
He was a she, actually.

46:11.128 --> 46:14.798
Baroness Amandine Lucile Dupin.

46:14.832 --> 46:17.100
Sand was her pen-name.

46:17.135 --> 46:19.569
My employer was a barrister.

46:19.604 --> 46:21.671
The house was filled
with books.

46:21.706 --> 46:25.542
- And I'll bet you read them all.
- As many as I could.

46:27.578 --> 46:32.015
Will you help me,
Mr. Thompson?

46:32.049 --> 46:34.784
All I want is to provide
for my children.

46:34.818 --> 46:37.987
I'd like to help you.

46:38.021 --> 46:41.056
Then tell me what to do.

46:41.091 --> 46:43.425
What do you want from me?

46:53.197 --> 46:56.389
To vote republican.

47:03.396 --> 47:07.932
- George, stop!
- Kiss me, baby. Come on.

47:07.966 --> 47:09.500
You see what
you're doing to me?

47:09.534 --> 47:10.968
Stop getting fresh.

47:11.002 --> 47:13.170
Come on, honey.
I'm crazy for you.

47:13.204 --> 47:15.705
Stop. I'm not
that kind of girl.

47:15.740 --> 47:18.574
Really? Well, what kind
of girl are you, huh?

47:21.144 --> 47:23.112
So that's the way
it's gonna be, huh?

47:23.146 --> 47:25.113
Come near me and I'll scream.

47:25.148 --> 47:27.982
Come near you?
Who can get close to you?

47:28.017 --> 47:30.584
Get your things.
I'm taking you back to Baltimore.

47:30.619 --> 47:32.319
At this hour?

47:32.353 --> 47:35.388
Well, I've got headlamps,
haven't I?

47:35.422 --> 47:37.689
<i>A guy comes home
and he sees his wife</i>

47:37.724 --> 47:38.957
<i>in bed with a stranger.</i>

47:38.992 --> 47:40.825
<i>He says, "what the hell
are you two doing?"</i>

47:40.860 --> 47:43.527
<i>She turns to the stranger and says, "see?
I told you he was stupid."</i>

47:43.562 --> 47:46.030
Fella comes
home to his wife and he says,

47:46.064 --> 47:49.733
"honey, pack your bags.
I've just won the Irish sweepstakes."

47:49.768 --> 47:53.169
She says, "well, should I pack
for warm weather or cold?"

47:53.204 --> 47:54.904
"Doesn't matter to me,"
he says,

47:54.938 --> 47:58.273
"as long as you're gone by noon.

47:58.307 --> 48:02.409
- You had one the other day...
- Nucky.

48:03.945 --> 48:07.213
Sir James of the Absecon isle.

48:13.819 --> 48:16.120
I got what you asked for.

48:19.257 --> 48:22.026
Do I need to count it?

48:22.060 --> 48:24.495
Only if you don't trust me.

48:27.933 --> 48:30.100
So we're square?

48:30.135 --> 48:32.269
As a block of ice.

48:33.905 --> 48:38.175
Gentlemen and ladies,
to the tables.

48:44.950 --> 48:47.051
Money plays.

48:47.085 --> 48:50.822
3,000 on black.

48:50.856 --> 48:53.224
<i>Check play.</i>

48:58.163 --> 49:00.665
<i>No more bets.</i>

49:06.335 --> 49:08.870
Anthe world turns.

49:13.007 --> 49:15.208
<i>- 23 red.
- Aw.</i>

49:15.243 --> 49:18.211
Not my night apparently.

49:18.245 --> 49:21.548
- It's okay, baby.
- I know.

49:22.984 --> 49:25.152
I've still got you though.
Right?

49:32.560 --> 49:35.762
A waste of time,
that's what this trip was.

49:35.797 --> 49:37.464
There are plenty of girls...

49:37.498 --> 49:39.199
plenty, who'd give
their eye teeth

49:39.234 --> 49:42.002
for a time like I showed you...

49:42.036 --> 49:46.006
theater, champagne,
fancy suppers,

49:46.040 --> 49:49.276
$70 in a dress shop!

49:50.645 --> 49:53.548
You could've shown a little
gratitude, you know.

49:54.583 --> 49:56.951
"Not that kind of girl."

49:56.986 --> 50:01.123
What kind of girl goes away with
a fella she just met, anyway?

50:02.391 --> 50:04.059
You can forget about
that beauty pageant,

50:04.093 --> 50:05.360
I'll tell you that right now.

50:05.395 --> 50:08.263
All right, enough.
Quit your jabbering.

50:08.297 --> 50:10.265
Pull over.

50:10.299 --> 50:12.401
Go on, do it.

50:26.783 --> 50:29.518
You wanna kiss me?
Go ahead.

50:29.553 --> 50:31.887
You bet I do.

50:35.292 --> 50:37.961
Go on, unbutton your trousers.

51:00.898 --> 51:04.000
Ahh!
