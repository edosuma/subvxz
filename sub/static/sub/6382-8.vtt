Oh, and by the way...

30:53.853 --> 30:56.344
...we don't even have a UV light
rigged in this room.

31:02.903 --> 31:04.234
Hey, come on. Open up.

31:09.035 --> 31:10.070
What are you--?

31:10.244 --> 31:12.735
My mom called,
said you were having a shitty day.

31:12.913 --> 31:14.414
Yeah, I am. Really shitty.

31:14.582 --> 31:18.951
We figured since everyone's gonna be out,
we'd stop by, take you out, cheer you up.

31:19.128 --> 31:21.494
Maybe you wanna blow off some steam?

31:21.672 --> 31:23.628
What do you say?

31:25.968 --> 31:28.584
-Fuck it.
WADE: Come on.

31:41.567 --> 31:43.558
Any idea what I'm doing here?

31:44.653 --> 31:46.735
I am so sorry.

32:04.006 --> 32:06.213
Instruct the scientists to watch the wards.

32:06.383 --> 32:09.295
Anyone else doesn't wanna drink,
they can join this little party.

32:09.470 --> 32:10.960
[NEWLIN SOBBING]

32:12.098 --> 32:13.759
Sarah.

32:19.605 --> 32:20.685
Yes, that's correct.

32:20.856 --> 32:22.357
And what was the flight number?

32:22.525 --> 32:23.856
Delta 956.

32:24.026 --> 32:25.061
Thank you.

32:27.196 --> 32:29.653
Okay, so, we're on that 7:00 flight home.

32:29.824 --> 32:32.406
-Listen, don't go.
-What?

32:32.576 --> 32:36.535
-Don't get on that flight. I want you to stay.
-|'m sorry, where is this coming from?

32:36.705 --> 32:38.320
I love your daughter, Mrs. Wright.

32:38.499 --> 32:40.410
I love you too.

32:40.584 --> 32:43.872
Listen to me, sweetie.
You have been to hell and back this week.

32:44.046 --> 32:48.164
You're in no state of mind to make any kind
of decision, let alone something this big.

32:48.342 --> 32:49.548
I'm staying.

32:49.718 --> 32:51.674
You're only 23 years old, Nicole.

32:51.846 --> 32:53.802
And may I ask how old you are, silver fox?

32:53.973 --> 32:56.715
Okay, Mom, did you reallyjust say that?

32:56.892 --> 32:59.304
-Come on, you're not this closed-minded.
SOOKIE: Hey, Sam?

33:00.563 --> 33:02.224
Did I come at a bad time?

33:04.942 --> 33:06.273
Kind of, yeah.

33:09.446 --> 33:10.731
SOOKIE:
Should I go?

33:10.906 --> 33:13.693
It's okay.
I need to talk with my mom anyways.

33:13.868 --> 33:15.358
-You sure?
NICOLE: Yeah.

33:15.536 --> 33:16.571
Excuse us.

33:17.163 --> 33:19.779
Mm-hm. Take your time, silver fox.

33:31.260 --> 33:33.342
I haven't talked to you since....

34:05.878 --> 34:07.618
They seem nice.

34:09.173 --> 34:12.791
Well, just now they weren't, but they are.
They're good people.

34:12.968 --> 34:15.459
I didn't know you were seeing
someone else.

34:15.638 --> 34:18.721
Yeah. It's pretty new.

34:19.808 --> 34:21.890
Oh, Jesus Christ.

34:23.896 --> 34:25.352
What'd I drink last night?

34:25.522 --> 34:28.013
I had a few last night myself.

34:29.526 --> 34:31.437
You don't drink.

34:31.612 --> 34:32.772
I do now.

34:34.281 --> 34:35.612
What are you drinking about?

34:35.783 --> 34:37.239
What's your drama?

34:37.409 --> 34:41.197
Oh, you know, vampires, fairies,
shit like that.

34:41.872 --> 34:44.204
You wouldn't be Sookie without it.

34:44.375 --> 34:46.286
What if I could be?

34:46.460 --> 34:48.416
What are you talking about?

34:48.921 --> 34:50.832
I wanna show you something.

34:55.469 --> 34:57.881
What the hell is that?

34:58.055 --> 35:01.513
Everything that makes me
a vampire magnet...

35:01.684 --> 35:04.847
...all rolled up
in one convenient little ball.

35:05.020 --> 35:06.476
What's it do?

35:06.647 --> 35:08.729
It kills vampires.

35:08.899 --> 35:11.015
But it also....

35:12.528 --> 35:16.897
If I were to throw this right now
and not absorb it back into my body...

35:17.074 --> 35:19.611
...my life with vampires would be behind me.

35:19.785 --> 35:21.446
We talked about this before, Sook.

35:21.620 --> 35:24.703
I know, and we both agreed
that life would be a whole lot easier...

35:24.873 --> 35:27.364
...if we didn't have to be special.

35:29.253 --> 35:30.834
I don't.

35:31.005 --> 35:32.711
Well, what do you want from me?

35:32.881 --> 35:34.872
Why are you here, Sookie?

35:36.552 --> 35:40.044
Part of me always thought
that you and I would...

35:40.222 --> 35:42.964
...I don't know,
wind up together or something.

35:47.396 --> 35:48.806
Put your ball away.

35:48.981 --> 35:51.848
-Sam....
-Put it away.

35:52.026 --> 35:55.939
You have always known
how I felt about you...

35:56.113 --> 35:57.148
...but you never cared.

35:57.323 --> 36:01.157
You kept me waiting because there was
always a more dangerous guy in the picture...

36:01.327 --> 36:04.785
...and now you walk in here and fuck--
Jesus fucking Christ, Sookie.

36:04.955 --> 36:07.241
-Your timing could not be worse.
-I am sorry.

36:07.416 --> 36:09.122
Nicole's pregnant.

36:09.793 --> 36:12.250
-Oh.
-Yeah.

36:13.255 --> 36:16.793
-I guess congratulations are in order?
-Well, thanks, but....

36:16.967 --> 36:19.504
Don't say anything to her.
She don't know about it yet.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.885
-How is that possible?
-I can smell it on her.

36:22.056 --> 36:25.719
-Well, don't you think she deserves--?
-Did I ask for your advice, Sookie?

36:27.895 --> 36:28.975
Bye, Sam.

36:36.195 --> 36:38.060
Bye, Sookie.

36:38.405 --> 36:41.112
The flowers are being sent
first thing tomorrow morning.

36:41.283 --> 36:43.524
I've confirmed with your florist.

36:43.702 --> 36:47.160
They are sending their freshest
and most beautiful calla lilies.

36:48.832 --> 36:50.288
Thank you, Mr. Jenkins.

36:50.459 --> 36:53.292
You've been so wonderful
throughout this entire process.

36:53.462 --> 36:56.795
You'll have time to check their placement
before the chaplain arrives...

36:56.965 --> 37:01.379
...about an hour before the service. If you'd
like, he can sit with you and the family...

37:01.553 --> 37:03.885
...and review any remarks
that you might wanna add.

37:04.056 --> 37:06.593
-That's very kind of him.
-And what about the Marines?

37:06.767 --> 37:11.101
I've confirmed with them as well. Your
grandson will be buried with full military honors.

37:11.271 --> 37:13.432
CAROLINE:
I want 21 guns.

37:13.607 --> 37:16.690
Not nine, not 15, 21.

37:16.860 --> 37:20.318
Of course, Mrs. Bellefleur.
I have made them aware.

37:20.489 --> 37:23.526
Honey, is there something you wanna say?

37:25.994 --> 37:28.326
She's distraught, the poor thing.

37:29.665 --> 37:31.872
Are y'all out of your fucking minds?

37:32.042 --> 37:33.782
-Arlene!
ARLENE: Guns?

37:33.961 --> 37:35.622
Terry was shot dead by a gun...

37:35.796 --> 37:39.254
...and y'all are planning
on having 21 of them at his funeral?

37:39.425 --> 37:43.259
Well, thank you
for that unwarranted outburst.

37:43.429 --> 37:44.794
Unwarranted?

37:44.972 --> 37:46.928
I would seriously love for this to stop.

37:47.099 --> 37:50.091
PORTIA:
This is a Bellefleur family funeral, Arlene...

37:50.269 --> 37:52.601
...and this is how
Bellefleur men are buried...

37:52.771 --> 37:55.979
...as they have served this country
with dignity in each generation...

37:56.150 --> 37:58.186
...since we arrived
from La Chante Sur Loire.

37:58.360 --> 38:01.818
Oh, well, that may be all Iah-dee-dah,
but the fact of the matter is...

38:01.989 --> 38:04.401
...Terry didn't give a shit about any of it.

38:04.575 --> 38:06.907
-Arlene.
-He didn't!

38:07.077 --> 38:10.945
The only reason he enlisted in the first place
was because his hoity-toity family...

38:11.123 --> 38:13.580
-...wouldn't pay for his college!
HOLLY: Okay.

38:13.750 --> 38:15.741
Honey, do you maybe wanna go outside?

38:15.919 --> 38:17.750
I do.

38:21.675 --> 38:26.294
Ijust wanna say one more thing before I go.

38:26.472 --> 38:29.384
The Terry Bellefleur that
y'all are burying tomorrow...

38:29.558 --> 38:32.470
...ain't the Terry Bellefleur that I knew.

38:32.644 --> 38:34.726
Y'all are burying a lie.

38:36.440 --> 38:38.021
HOLLY:
Come on.

38:46.783 --> 38:51.823
I'm trying to decide if it's gonna be
more uncomfortable for me in here or out there.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.697
I'm gonna go out there.

38:56.210 --> 38:58.292
Chaplain this, flowers that.

38:58.462 --> 39:01.204
Guns? Oh, yeah, sure, why not?
Sounds good.

39:01.381 --> 39:02.587
What's going on?

39:02.758 --> 39:05.090
Your grandmother and sister
are steamrolling her.

39:05.260 --> 39:06.591
-That's what's going on.
-What you want?

39:06.762 --> 39:07.968
You want a different chaplain,
different flowers?

39:08.138 --> 39:10.174
I'll tell you something else.
I ain't taking that money.

39:10.349 --> 39:11.384
What?

39:11.558 --> 39:15.597
If I took it, then I'd be part of the same lie
that they're part of and I won't do it.

39:15.771 --> 39:17.102
He had himself killed, Andy.

39:17.272 --> 39:18.887
-I think I know who did it.
-Arlene.

39:19.066 --> 39:20.226
-You need to stop.
-Quiet!

39:20.400 --> 39:23.312
His name's Justin something.
Uh, um....

39:23.904 --> 39:27.067
McGillich! Justin McGillich.
You need to bring him tojustice.

39:27.241 --> 39:30.654
And if I do, then what? Who wins?

39:30.827 --> 39:32.863
The insurance company, that's who wins.

39:33.038 --> 39:36.326
Now, yes, I'm the sheriff of the parish
where this crime was committed.

39:36.500 --> 39:40.368
And if you decide you want me
to chase this guy down, then I will...

39:40.546 --> 39:42.082
...but don't make me.

39:42.256 --> 39:43.917
Please.

39:44.591 --> 39:48.755
Look, it's been-- It's tragic.

39:48.929 --> 39:50.465
Okay? It is.

39:50.639 --> 39:53.972
But, honey, he wanted you
to have that money, okay?

39:54.142 --> 39:56.679
He couldn't have been
any more desperate than he was...

39:56.853 --> 39:59.230
...but he still had it in him
to think about you...

39:59.398 --> 40:01.639
...to provide for you and your kids.

40:03.026 --> 40:05.438
But he left us.

40:05.612 --> 40:07.113
-He left us on purpose.
-I know.

40:07.281 --> 40:10.148
I know, I know, I know. I'm pissed off too.

40:10.325 --> 40:12.782
How can we help?

40:14.871 --> 40:16.657
Oh, come here.

40:19.001 --> 40:21.162
I want carnations.

40:21.336 --> 40:23.076
They're happy and I want them.

40:23.255 --> 40:24.370
You got it.

40:24.548 --> 40:27.164
And I want Reverend Daniels
from the black church.

40:27.342 --> 40:28.673
Terry really liked him.

40:28.844 --> 40:32.007
-He would've wanted Reverend Daniels.
-That's gonna be hard.

40:32.180 --> 40:33.841
But you'll do it.

40:34.016 --> 40:35.677
Damn right I will.

41:05.714 --> 41:08.205
Well, this is rich.

41:09.926 --> 41:12.463
I used to come to this place for solace.

41:14.222 --> 41:17.680
I used to come here looking for...

41:17.851 --> 41:19.762
...I don't know...

41:20.771 --> 41:22.136
...love.

41:24.566 --> 41:27.899
My memories of you
were kissing me good night...

41:28.070 --> 41:32.109
...and baking cakes and Iullabies.

41:33.742 --> 41:36.734
There was some bad stuff too,
but it was mostly good.

41:39.414 --> 41:42.247
And now those memories are gone.

41:43.794 --> 41:47.582
They've been replaced with pain...

41:47.756 --> 41:50.247
...and murder...

41:50.425 --> 41:52.381
...and fucking darkness.

41:56.014 --> 41:58.926
So here we're all gonna lie...

41:59.101 --> 42:02.309
...all of us Stackhouses.

42:02.479 --> 42:05.892
Dead but not gone...

42:08.318 --> 42:11.105
...because death ain't the end anymore.

42:12.572 --> 42:14.608
We all know that now.

42:16.618 --> 42:20.327
Death is just a fucking pit stop...

42:20.497 --> 42:23.159
...on a road that keeps on going...

42:25.293 --> 42:27.375
...with no end in sight.

42:32.259 --> 42:35.001
So fuck you, Mom and Dad.

42:37.139 --> 42:39.380
Screw your kisses...

42:39.558 --> 42:41.264
...and your hugs...

42:41.435 --> 42:44.427
...and your "attagirls."

42:44.604 --> 42:47.095
I'm gonna become the very thing...

42:47.274 --> 42:49.890
...that you hated so much...

42:50.944 --> 42:53.686
...you were willing to kill me over it.

42:56.241 --> 43:00.154
Because I'll be damned
if I'm gonna spend eternity...

43:00.328 --> 43:02.580
...lying by your fucking sides.

43:08.503 --> 43:11.836
I'd rather walk the earth as a corpse...

43:13.842 --> 43:17.005
...than spend another minute
thinking about you.

43:40.744 --> 43:42.860
-Where's Burrell? Is he here?
-No, ma'am.

43:43.038 --> 43:45.324
You better not be fucking lying to me.

43:45.499 --> 43:47.740
Someone find me Governor Burrell!

43:48.627 --> 43:50.037
Sarah...

43:50.212 --> 43:54.876
...that spokesbitch from Yokonomo
Corporation just arrived very upset.

43:55.050 --> 43:56.415
What does she want?

43:56.593 --> 43:59.175
She's demanding to speak
to the governor.

44:04.059 --> 44:06.641
He promised us his face
would not fucking be on this...

44:06.812 --> 44:08.143
...and now guess what.

44:08.313 --> 44:10.349
His fucking face is all over it.

44:10.524 --> 44:14.563
-Miss Suzuki, may I advise caution--
-Fuck caution! I'm pissed.

44:18.073 --> 44:19.938
Where's that going?

44:20.158 --> 44:21.819
I, uh....

44:23.036 --> 44:24.572
Damn it.

44:29.209 --> 44:30.324
Hi.

44:31.336 --> 44:32.872
Morning.

44:34.798 --> 44:37.005
Beautiful day, isn't it?

44:37.175 --> 44:38.506
SUZUKI:
Governor!

44:38.677 --> 44:42.261
-Governor Burrell!
-The governor's not here.

44:42.430 --> 44:43.761
Anything I can help you with?

44:43.932 --> 44:46.048
-Sarah Newlin?
-Don't tell me you're a fan.

44:46.226 --> 44:47.466
Where's the governor?

44:47.644 --> 44:49.225
Like the press release said...

44:49.396 --> 44:52.604
...in the wake of an unprecedented attack
on the governor's mansion...

44:52.774 --> 44:55.140
...he has been moved
to an undisclosed location.

44:55.360 --> 44:56.941
Is this the undisclosed location?

44:57.112 --> 44:59.945
-No, it's not.
-Then what the hell is this place?

45:00.115 --> 45:01.901
This is for government employees only.

45:02.075 --> 45:03.986
You're a government employee,
Miss Newlin?

45:04.160 --> 45:07.323
What I am is a businesswoman.

45:07.497 --> 45:10.830
As are you, okay?

45:11.001 --> 45:13.868
The both of us are strong women...

45:14.045 --> 45:17.583
