00:10.744 --> 00:13.347
( theme music playing )

00:38.239 --> 00:40.374
( ticking rhythmically )

00:42.243 --> 00:44.512
( beeping rhythmically )

00:50.984 --> 00:53.354
( clinking musically )

00:58.759 --> 01:00.728
( funky music continues )

01:06.667 --> 01:08.802

01:18.346 --> 01:20.548

- ( clacking )

01:30.158 --> 01:32.493
( cooing musically )

01:39.867 --> 01:41.802

01:44.172 --> 01:46.540
( cell phone ringing )

01:52.079 --> 01:54.315
( knocks on door )

01:57.751 --> 01:59.287
UH...

02:06.394 --> 02:08.562
( knocking on door )

02:10.564 --> 02:13.467
- ( music stops )
- WE'RE BEING WAY TOO LOUD?

02:13.567 --> 02:15.403
YES, BUT THIS IS
REGARDING THE RENT.

02:15.503 --> 02:19.139
- OH, WE'VE PAID OUR RENT.
- WE'VE PAID OUR RENT.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.475
- YOU GAVE ME A CHECK.
- WE GAVE YOU THAT CHECK.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.511
- YEAH.
- YEAH, BUT I'VE BEEN
COLLECTING THE CHECKS

02:23.611 --> 02:26.180
AND I JUST WENT
TO THE BANK TO DEPOSIT THEM

02:26.280 --> 02:28.516
AND THEY'RE
IN THE WRONG CURRENCY.

02:28.616 --> 02:32.019
- WHAT?
- THEY'RE IN
NEW ZEALAND DOLLARS.

02:32.119 --> 02:33.821
- MM-HMM.
- OH, THEY'RE PROBABLY--

02:33.921 --> 02:36.557
- YEAH, OUR CHECKBOOK IS--
- IT'S A NEW ZEALAND ACCOUNT.

02:36.657 --> 02:39.927
- NEW ZEALAND ACCOUNT.
- YEAH, I NEED YOU TO PAY
RENT IN AMERICAN DOLLARS.

02:40.027 --> 02:42.763
- OKAY.
- RETROACTIVELY...

02:42.863 --> 02:44.732
AND FUTURE ACTIVELY.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.634
WELL, WE CAN'T DO
ANYTHING IN THE PAST.

02:46.734 --> 02:51.339
NO, BUT YOU COULD PAY ME
NOW FOR THE MISTAKES
OF THE PAST.

02:51.439 --> 02:53.274
- Eugene: YEAH.
- HOW MUCH DO WE OWE?

02:53.374 --> 02:55.709
OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS,
YOU'VE COME UP SHORT

02:55.809 --> 02:59.980
AND YOU OWE ME $7,727.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.849
( trash can lids
clanging )

03:03.617 --> 03:06.454
- YEAH.
- IS THAT AMERICAN DOLLARS
OR REAL DOLLARS?

03:06.554 --> 03:09.857
- AMERICAN.
- THAT-- WE OWE YOU
THAT MUCH?

03:09.957 --> 03:13.261
- YEAH, AND FOR NEW ZEALAND
DOLLARS, YOU WOULD OWE...
- ( watch beeping )

03:13.361 --> 03:15.062
...THAT MUCH.

03:15.162 --> 03:17.331
- ( gasps )
- YEAH.

03:17.431 --> 03:21.201
- $77,000.
- YEAH. YEAH.

03:21.302 --> 03:24.772
- CAN WE GIVE YOU
AN I.O.U.?
- NO. NO.

03:24.872 --> 03:27.675
- IN AMERICAN DOLLARS,
NOT IN NEW ZEALAND DOLLARS.
- OH, NO.

03:27.775 --> 03:30.143
- NO, I'M GONNA NEED--
I PREFER THE MONEY.
- Jemaine: THE MONEY.

03:30.244 --> 03:31.645
- Both: YEAH.
- SOON?

03:31.745 --> 03:33.914
- YEAH. UH-HUH.
- LET ME HANDLE THIS, BRET.

03:34.014 --> 03:36.650
- CAN I BE HONEST
WITH YOU?
- YES.

03:36.750 --> 03:39.052
WE DON'T HAVE ANY--
ANYWHERE NEAR

03:39.152 --> 03:41.021
THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY.

03:41.121 --> 03:43.924
WHEN DO YOU THINK
YOU WILL HAVE THAT
AMOUNT OF MONEY?

03:44.024 --> 03:45.826
- MAY I?
- YES.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.595
( watch beeping )

03:47.695 --> 03:49.897
OKAY, HERE--
HERE IT IS. UMM--

03:49.997 --> 03:52.266
- WHOA.
- OOH.

03:52.366 --> 03:55.536
- NEVER.
- I'M GOING TO
GIVE YOU A MONTH.

03:55.636 --> 03:57.605
YOU HAVE A MONTH
TO PAY YOUR RENT,
OTHERWISE YOU HAVE TO LEAVE.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.773
- WELL--
- CAN WE CHOOSE
WHICH MONTH?

03:59.873 --> 04:01.909
NO.

04:03.977 --> 04:06.113
- EVICTED?
- MMM.

04:06.213 --> 04:08.616
- BY WHOSE AUTHORITY?
- THE LANDLORD.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.684
- WHY?
- JUST BECAUSE
WE WERE PAYING

04:10.784 --> 04:12.920
WITH NEW ZEALAND DOLLARS
INSTEAD OF AMERICAN DOLLARS.

04:13.020 --> 04:15.423
OKAY, SO HE'S A RACIST
AND NOW YOU'RE HOMELESS.

04:15.523 --> 04:18.492
- YEAH,
IT'S REALLY TERRIBLE.
- OH, BRET.

04:18.592 --> 04:21.094
- PRESENT.
- JEMAINE.

04:21.194 --> 04:23.964
- PRESENT.
- WELL, MURRAY, PRESENT.

04:24.064 --> 04:26.133
( sighs )

04:26.233 --> 04:28.135
I THINK
IT MIGHT BE TIME, GUYS.

04:28.235 --> 04:31.038
- WHAT FOR?
- TO STAGE YOUR LIVES

04:31.138 --> 04:32.573
AS AN OFF-BROADWAY MUSICAL.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.274
- OH.
- OH, YEAH, OF COURSE.

04:34.375 --> 04:36.477
IS THERE A MORE
PRACTICAL SOLUTION?

04:36.577 --> 04:38.145
- NO, JUST--
- ONE THAT RELATES
TO OUR PROBLEM?

04:38.245 --> 04:40.047
LOOK AT THIS.

04:40.147 --> 04:41.582
IT'S TIME
TO SHOW YOU, OKAY?

04:41.682 --> 04:43.250
I'VE BEEN WRITING THIS
FOR TWO YEARS...

04:43.351 --> 04:45.252
SECRETLY, ALL RIGHT?

04:45.353 --> 04:46.820
IT'S A MUSICAL,
LIKE "MAMMA MIA"...

04:46.920 --> 04:49.823
- "MAMMA MIA"?
- ...BUT THIS IS
YOUR MUSICAL.

04:49.923 --> 04:51.124
ALL RIGHT?
IT'S YOUR STORY.

04:51.224 --> 04:54.328
- A MUSICAL?
- YEAH, ABOUT YOUR LIVES.

04:54.428 --> 04:55.963
WE HAVEN'T GOT
ANYWHERE TO LIVE,
AND YOU'RE SAYING

04:56.063 --> 04:58.298
WE SHOULD PUT ON--
MAYBE WE SHOULD PUT
ON A MUSICAL?

04:58.399 --> 05:00.701
I THINK SO.
THE OPPORTUNITY
HAS ARISEN

05:00.801 --> 05:03.371
TO PRESENT THIS
TO YOU, OKAY?

05:03.471 --> 05:05.806
IT'S ABOUT A COUPLE
OF DEADBEAT GUYS
FROM NEW ZEALAND

05:05.906 --> 05:08.576
- WHO HAVE GOT NOTHING GOING ON.
- WAIT, WHO ARE THOSE
CHARACTERS?

05:08.676 --> 05:11.579
JEMAINE AND BRET.
IT'S-- IT'S BASED ON YOU,

05:11.679 --> 05:14.081
- AND YOU COME
TO AMERICA WITH A DREAM.
- HOW INSULTING.

05:14.181 --> 05:16.717
- IT SAYS
"TWO HOPELESS LOSERS."
- YUP, THAT'S YOU.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.820
YOU'RE DOWN AND OUT.
AT THE BEGINNING YOU'VE
GOT NOTHING

05:19.920 --> 05:23.524
AND YOU START AT THE BOTTOM,
BUT WITH A BIT OF HARD WORK

05:23.624 --> 05:26.427
AND THE HELP
OF A SAVVY MANAGER
WHO SHOWS YOU THE LIGHT--

05:26.527 --> 05:28.662
- WHO'S THAT?
- OH, THAT'S A CHARACTER

05:28.762 --> 05:30.464
WHO'S BASED ON ME,
LOOSELY BASED ON ME--

05:30.564 --> 05:31.699
YOU MAKE IT TO THE TOP.

05:31.799 --> 05:34.535
OUR STORY IS
THE STORY OF TWO GUYS

05:34.635 --> 05:37.237
WHO START AT THE BOTTOM
AND WITH A LOT OF HARD WORK

05:37.337 --> 05:39.106
CONTINUE ALONG
THE BOTTOM

05:39.206 --> 05:40.608
AND FINALLY END UP
AT THE BOTTOM.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.576
OH YEAH, THAT'S
AN INTRIGUING SCENARIO.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.878
- YEAH, IT'S A RAGS-
TO-RAGS STORY.
- YEAH, IMAGINE IT.

05:44.978 --> 05:46.980
YEAH, DID YOU SEE
THE ONE ABOUT THE GUYS
WHO STARTED AT THE BOTTOM,

05:47.080 --> 05:49.450
STAYED AT THE BOTTOM
AND AT THE END THEY WERE
STILL AT THE BOTTOM?

05:49.550 --> 05:52.520
- OH. YES, THAT'S OUR LIVES.
- SO INSPIRATIONAL.

05:52.620 --> 05:54.922
- WHO'D GO AND SEE THAT?
- I-- I THINK I'D SEE THAT.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.890
- I WOULD GO SEE THAT.
- IT'S MORE REALISTIC.

05:56.990 --> 05:59.727
YOU'RE THINKING
THAT YOU'RE AT THE END
OF YOUR TETHER NOW,

05:59.827 --> 06:01.529
BUT WHAT IF THIS IS
JUST THE BEGINNING
OF YOUR STORY?

06:01.629 --> 06:03.431
THEN IT'S A SLOW START,
ISN'T IT?

06:03.531 --> 06:05.132
THIS IS
GOOD STUFF, OKAY?

06:05.232 --> 06:08.001
I WAS WRITING THIS
AND AT THE SAME TIME
I WAS READING IT.

06:08.101 --> 06:09.570
I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.805
- TAKE A LOOK AT THE END.
- WHAT HAPPENS AT THE END?

06:11.905 --> 06:15.108
AT THE END YOU
END UP STAGING YOURSELVES
A BIG BROADWAY MUSICAL

06:15.208 --> 06:18.145
- AND IT'S A GREAT SUCCESS.
- YEAH, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
IT'S GONNA HAPPEN LIKE THAT.

06:18.245 --> 06:21.682
WELL, EVERYTHING SO FAR
HAS TURNED OUT, BRET, OKAY?

06:21.782 --> 06:23.684
YEAH, BUT THAT'S BECAUSE
IT'S BASED ON TRUTH--
THIS IS OUR STORY--

06:23.784 --> 06:25.553
AND THEN YOU JUST MADE UP
THE END WITH A MUSICAL.

06:25.653 --> 06:27.955
SOME OF IT'S IN THE FUTURE.
BUT LOOK AT THIS SCENE.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.890
LOOK, YOU COME
INTO MY OFFICE

06:29.990 --> 06:32.460
AND I TELL YOU ABOUT
THE MUSICAL I'VE WRITTEN.
IT'S JUST LIKE NOW.

06:32.560 --> 06:33.861
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

06:33.961 --> 06:35.596
- OH YEAH, YOU SAY "REALLY?"
- THERE YOU GO.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.665
YOU'VE GOT "REALLY?" HERE.
I KNEW YOU'D SAY THAT.

06:37.765 --> 06:40.668
- THE THING IS--
- OH, WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE SINGING.

06:40.768 --> 06:43.403
YEAH, WHEN I TELL YOU
THE NEWS, AND HERE
YOU LOVE IT

06:43.504 --> 06:45.506
AND YOU GET UP ON YOUR
CHAIRS AND SING, BUT--

06:45.606 --> 06:47.641
- THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
- TRUST ME, GUYS,

06:47.741 --> 06:50.911
THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT.
THIS IS OUR LAST RESORT.

06:51.011 --> 06:53.514
IT SURE IS.

06:53.614 --> 06:54.982
CAN WE STAY AT YOUR PLACE
TONIGHT, MURRAY?

06:55.082 --> 06:57.317
YEAH, SURE,

06:57.417 --> 06:59.520
BUT I'VE
ONLY GOT ONE BED

06:59.620 --> 07:03.457
AND I GROPE PEOPLE
IN MY SLEEP.

07:03.557 --> 07:05.158
IT'S A CONDITION.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.827
IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS

07:06.927 --> 07:08.529
I HAD TO LEAVE
THE NEW ZEALAND ARMY.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.864
WE'LL JUST STAY
ON THE CO-- ON THE FLOOR.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.833
I'LL PROBABLY
FIND YOU THERE.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.569
I TEND TO--
I REALLY REACH OUT.

07:15.669 --> 07:19.507
- I'LL SLEEP
IN THE KITCHEN.
- MMM, OKAY.

07:21.008 --> 07:22.510
MMM, NEVER MIND.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.444
- NO?
- WE'LL FIND SOMEWHERE.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.013
YEAH, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.616
THAT'S ACTUALLY
BETTER FOR THE STORY,
IF YOU'RE HOMELESS.

07:30.250 --> 07:33.186
"TWO HOMELESS DEADBEATS
GO OUT ONTO THE STREETS."

07:33.286 --> 07:36.624
WOW, THIS IS
GREAT STUFF.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.427
( bell dings )

07:40.528 --> 07:42.496
I'M SORRY I CAN'T
HELP YOU GUYS OUT,

07:42.596 --> 07:46.133
BUT I THINK THE OTHER GUY
LIVING IN MY APARTMENT IS
A DANGEROUS DRUG DEALER.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.235
- YOUR DAD?
- Dave: YEAH.

07:48.335 --> 07:51.204
I CAN'T HAVE YOU
AT MY APARTMENT. WHAT IF
SOME CRAZY SHIT GOES DOWN?

07:51.304 --> 07:54.808
- YEAH.
- AND I'M NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE
FRIENDS OVER ON WEEKNIGHTS,

07:54.908 --> 07:58.546
- BUT THIS PLACE IS GOOD.
- HEY, GUYS.

07:58.646 --> 08:00.413
HI, WE'D LIKE
TO INQUIRE ABOUT A ROOM.

08:00.514 --> 08:02.282
MM-HMM, SURE.

08:02.382 --> 08:04.918
BUT WE ONLY HAVE
$51 AMERICAN.

08:05.018 --> 08:08.488
WE ONLY HAVE ONE ROOM
THAT YOU CAN GET FOR $51--

08:08.589 --> 08:11.224
- ROOM 204.
- THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

08:11.324 --> 08:14.628
WELL, THE THING ABOUT
ROOM 204 IS THAT A TERRIBLE
MURDER HAPPENED THERE--

08:14.728 --> 08:16.697
A WOMAN KILLED
HER HUSBAND.

08:16.797 --> 08:18.532
IT WAS THE MOST
GRUESOME THING
I EVER HEARD OF.

08:18.632 --> 08:20.100
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHAT-- WHAT HAPPENED?

08:20.200 --> 08:22.402
SHE DECAPITATED HIM,

08:22.502 --> 08:24.705
CASTRATED HIM,
DEFANGED HIM.

08:24.805 --> 08:27.007
SHE REMOVED
HIS HANDS AND FEET.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.643
- RIGHT.
- I'LL ALWAYS
REMEMBER THE DAY

08:29.743 --> 08:32.946
OF THAT MOST
HORRIBLE MURDER--
THE 1st OF NOVEMBER.

08:33.046 --> 08:35.048
- OH, THAT'S TODAY'S DATE.
- WEIRD.

08:35.148 --> 08:37.184
YEAH, IT'S TODAY'S DATE.
IT HAPPENED EARLIER TODAY.

08:37.284 --> 08:38.719
- EH?
- Dave: SHIT.

08:38.819 --> 08:40.353
AND THE POLICE
PSYCHOLOGIST SAID

08:40.453 --> 08:41.922
SHE WOULD RETURN
TO THE SCENE...

08:42.022 --> 08:43.490
TO KILL AGAIN.

08:43.591 --> 08:44.925
- HEY, GUYS.
- Dave: OH! SHIT.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.627
- HEY, MEL.
- WHERE'S DOUG?

08:46.727 --> 08:48.662
- OH, HE'S JUST THERE.
- HEY, GUYS.

08:48.762 --> 08:50.430
- Dave: OH! SHIT.
- HEY.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.801
I HEARD YOU DON'T HAVE
A PLACE TO STAY.

08:53.901 --> 08:55.736
- YEAH.
- I WOULD LOVE IT

08:55.836 --> 08:58.071
IF YOU'D STAY WITH US.

08:58.171 --> 09:00.107
OH, WE'RE OKAY.
WE JUST GOT A ROOM.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.175
OH.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.814
THANKS FOR THE OFFER,
THOUGH.

09:06.914 --> 09:08.215
YEAH.

09:08.315 --> 09:10.017
HMM.

09:10.117 --> 09:11.585
ACTUALLY, MAYBE THAT
WOULD BE QUITE GOOD.

09:11.685 --> 09:13.353
THANK YOU, MEL.
THANK YOU, DOUG.

09:13.453 --> 09:16.757
- OF COURSE!
- EH?

09:18.826 --> 09:21.662
OKAY, SO ANOTHER RULE:

09:21.762 --> 09:23.631
THERE WILL BE
NO BRINGING GIRLS
BACK TO THE HOUSE.

09:23.731 --> 09:26.600
I KNOW HOW
YOU GUYS ARE.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.435
ACTUALLY, MEL,
I DON'T SEE ANY REASON

09:28.535 --> 09:30.904
WHY THEY CAN'T
BRING GIRLS BACK HERE
TO VISIT IF THEY WANT.

09:31.004 --> 09:34.041
UH, DO YOU WANT
TO BRING SOME GIRLS
HOME TOO, DOUG?

09:34.141 --> 09:37.144
- NO, BUT I DON'T SEE
ANY REASON WHY THEY CAN'T.
- NO, THAT'S FINE.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.979
YEAH, MAYBE I'LL BRING
SOME GIRLS HOME TOO,

09:39.079 --> 09:41.014
JUST FIND SOME
REAL AUTHENTIC SLUTS

09:41.114 --> 09:44.017
AND JUST TURN THIS HOUSE
INTO A WHOREHOME.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.920
- IS THAT WHAT
YOU'D LIKE, DOUG?
- NO, IT'S NOT, BUT--

09:47.020 --> 09:50.023
THERE WILL BE
NO SMOKING, DRINKING
OR DRUGS, NO PARTYING.

09:50.123 --> 09:52.893
- WE DON'T PARTY.
- I KNOW, THAT'S FOR DOUG.

09:52.993 --> 09:56.697
AHEM. HE STRUGGLED
WITH ADDICTION.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.232
OKAY, NUMBER 8:

09:59.332 --> 10:01.769
YOU MUST NOT LEAVE
THE HOUSE.

10:01.869 --> 10:04.237
- WHEN?
- WHAT, NEVER?

10:04.337 --> 10:06.239
WELL, NOT AFTER 11:30 P.M.

10:06.339 --> 10:09.509
AND PREFERABLY NEVER.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.945
UMM, I THINK THAT'S--

10:12.045 --> 10:15.182
SO OTHER THAN THOSE RULES,
THERE ARE NO RULES.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.785
NOW BEFORE WE TURN IN,
I WOULD JUST LOVE IT

10:17.885 --> 10:20.387
IF YOU GUYS COULD PLAY
A SONG FOR ME.

10:20.487 --> 10:24.357
THE THING IS
BRET IS OVERTIRED

10:24.457 --> 10:27.294
AND THERE'S A RISK
OF THROAT POLYPS.

10:27.394 --> 10:29.029
- OH.
- WHAT ARE THEY?

10:29.129 --> 10:31.732
WHY DON'T I PLAY
A LITTLE SOMETHING
FOR ALL OF US ON THE HARP?

10:31.832 --> 10:35.703
OH, DOUG! NO.

10:35.803 --> 10:37.204
THAT IS SUCH
A WOMANLY INSTRUMENT.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.740
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF A MAN PLAYING A HARP?

10:39.840 --> 10:41.809
- MY DAD PLAYS THE HARP.
- I'VE NEVER HEARD--

10:41.909 --> 10:43.911
I'VE NEVER SEEN
A MAN PLAY A HARP.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.482
THERE YOU GO, BRET--

10:49.582 --> 10:52.085
- NICE AND TUCKED IN.
- THANK YOU, MEL.

10:52.185 --> 10:54.755
- KEEP YOU--
- IT'S VERY TIGHT.
I CAN'T REALLY MOVE.

10:54.855 --> 10:58.225
- OKAY, SWEET DREAMS.
- THANK YOU.

10:58.325 --> 11:01.494
MEL, I WAS
WONDERING IF WE COULD
HAVE THE HEAT TURNED DOWN.

11:01.594 --> 11:03.063
- IT'S QUITE HOT IN HERE.
- YES, VERY HOT.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.966
- OH, THE HEATER'S BROKEN.
- BUT I SAW YOU TURNING IT--

11:06.066 --> 11:08.736
YOU COULD ALWAYS
PUSH THESE BACK
A LITTLE BIT.

11:10.470 --> 11:11.872
- THAT'S OKAY.
- OKAY.

11:11.972 --> 11:16.509
OKAY. WELL, I AM
GOING TO LOCK THE DOOR

11:16.609 --> 11:20.080
- FOR SECURITY, SO--
- WOULD YOU BE ABLE
TO LEAVE THAT OPEN?

11:20.180 --> 11:23.283
NO, IT'S A VERY
DANGEROUS NEIGHBORHOOD.

11:23.383 --> 11:25.753
I SOMETIMES GO TO THE TOILET
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

11:25.853 --> 11:27.821
MM-HMM. I KNOW.

11:27.921 --> 11:29.857
YOU GUYS ARE SO CUTE.

11:29.957 --> 11:31.424
I COULD JUST EAT YOU UP.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.026
( giggles )
GOOD NIGHT.

11:33.126 --> 11:36.196
- ( keys jingle )
- ( lock clicks )

11:37.530 --> 11:40.100
( wood creaking )

11:41.701 --> 11:44.071
- ( seagull caws )
- ( waves crashing )

11:46.840 --> 11:49.009
( folk music playing )

12:00.153 --> 12:03.423
* PETROV,
YELYENA AND ME *

12:03.523 --> 12:06.827
* LOST BUT HAPPY AT SEA

12:06.927 --> 12:09.763
* PETROV AND YELYENA
SAID TO ME... *

12:09.863 --> 12:12.966
Both:
SHOULDN'T WE HAVE
SOMETHING TO EAT?

12:13.066 --> 12:16.804
* I SAY THERE ARE PLENTY
OF FISH IN THE SEA *

12:16.904 --> 12:19.940
* BUT ALL
THEY CAN SEE IS ME *

12:20.040 --> 12:23.110
- * THEY SAID...
- Both: ANY LAST REQUESTS?

12:23.210 --> 12:26.646
* BIDING MY TIME,
I SAID, "YES *

12:26.746 --> 12:30.050
* I WANT TO PARTY,
JUST WE THREE *

12:30.150 --> 12:33.486
* LOST BUT HAPPY
AT SEA" *

12:34.988 --> 12:37.858
* SO WE DRANK ALL NIGHT
FROM THE KEG *

12:37.958 --> 12:41.929
* I PASSED OUT AND I WOKE
WITH ONE LEG, I SAID... *

12:42.029 --> 12:45.098
"PETROV, HAVE YOU
SEEN MY LEG?"
* HE SAID...

12:45.198 --> 12:47.935
- NO.
- * AND HE WENT
BACK TO BED *

12:48.035 --> 12:51.171
* BUT HE LOOKED
SUSPICIOUSLY WELL-FED *

12:51.271 --> 12:55.042
* THREE DAYS LATER,
THEY'RE HUNGRY AGAIN *

12:55.142 --> 12:58.912
- * THEY SAID...
- Both: ANY LAST REQUESTS,
MY FRIEND, AGAIN?

12:59.012 --> 13:02.515
SO I SAID, "DO YOU KNOW
ANY ROLLING STONES?"

13:02.615 --> 13:06.086
IT WAS A HILARIOUS MOMENT
IN A VERY BLEAK BLEAK
TIME OF MY LIFE.

13:06.186 --> 13:09.890
* SO WE DANCED ALL NIGHT
TO THE ROLLING STONES *

13:09.990 --> 13:13.193
* WHEN I AWOKE,
THEY WERE CHEWING ON BONES *

13:13.293 --> 13:16.229
* YELYENA WAS SUPPING BLOOD
FROM A CUP... *

13:16.329 --> 13:18.899
THAT'S WHEN I KNEW
THAT SOMETHING WAS UP.

13:18.999 --> 13:21.568
HEY, PETROV, WHAT IS
THAT YOU ARE EATING?

13:21.668 --> 13:24.137
- IT'S FISH.
- HOW COME IT LOOKS
SO MUCH LIKE MY ARM

13:24.237 --> 13:25.973
WHICH HAS BEEN HACKED OFF
AT THE ELBOW LAST NIGHT?

13:26.073 --> 13:28.141
OH, IT'S AN ARM FISH.

13:28.241 --> 13:31.444
* LATER THAT NIGHT,
WHILE THEY WERE ASLEEP *

13:31.544 --> 13:34.747
* I SWALLOWED SOME ARSENIC
TO POISON MY MEAT *

13:34.848 --> 13:38.085
* I WAS VERY ILL,
BUT REVENGE IS SO SWEET *

13:38.185 --> 13:42.089
* UNLIKE THE LAST MEAL
MY COMRADES WOULD EAT *

13:49.396 --> 13:52.966
* WHEN I AWOKE,
THEY WERE ALREADY DEAD *

13:53.066 --> 13:56.269
* ALL THAT WAS LEFT
OF ME WAS MY HEAD *

13:56.369 --> 13:59.672
* NO, NOT DEAD,
JUST A HEAD *

13:59.772 --> 14:03.911
* LOST BUT SO LONELY

14:04.011 --> 14:07.580
* AT SEA.

14:08.882 --> 14:10.550
( seagull caws )

14:14.121 --> 14:16.523
OKAY, NOW IN THIS SCENE

14:16.623 --> 14:18.458
YOU'RE BACK IN NEW ZEALAND,
YOU'RE ON YOUR FARM,

14:18.558 --> 14:20.560
YOU'RE FRUSTRATED
WITH YOUR UNCLE AND AUNTIE

14:20.660 --> 14:22.862
BECAUSE THEY WON'T
LET YOU GO INTO TOWN
TO PLAY YOUR MUSIC.

14:22.963 --> 14:25.432
READY? GO.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.734
"I JUST WANT TO PLAY GUITAR
WITH MY FRIENDS."

14:27.834 --> 14:29.769
WE NEED YOU BACK
ON THE FARM, BRET,

14:29.869 --> 14:33.140
- JUST FOR ONE MORE SEASON.
- BUT THAT'S A WHOLE
ANOTHER YEAR AWAY.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.008
LISTEN TO YOUR UNCLE, BRET!

14:35.875 --> 14:37.377
MURRAY, WHO'S SHE?

14:37.477 --> 14:39.512
DON'T LOOK AT ME.
I'M NOT HERE, BRET.

14:39.612 --> 14:41.748
YOU'RE IN YOUR WORLD, OKAY?

14:41.848 --> 14:44.284
- WHERE'D YOU GET
THIS STUFF FROM?
- YOU'RE TALKING TO ME NOW?

14:44.384 --> 14:46.920
JUST-- IF WE-- CAN WE STOP
REHEARSAL FOR A SECOND?

14:47.020 --> 14:48.455
STOP THERE.
OKAY, STOP THERE.

14:48.555 --> 14:51.858
THIS SEEMS VERY SIMILAR
TO "STAR WARS."

14:51.959 --> 14:54.894
I'VE MIXED YOU UP WITH--
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

14:54.995 --> 14:56.863
- LUKE SKYWALKER.
- --LUKE SKYWALKER.

14:56.964 --> 14:58.665
DAMN IT.

14:58.765 --> 15:02.602
- YEAH.
- SORRY, GUYS, YOU WON'T
BE NEEDED FOR THIS SCENE.

15:02.702 --> 15:04.904
SO YOU'VE GOT A DAD
AND A MOM INSTEAD OF
AN AUNTIE AND UNCLE.

15:05.005 --> 15:07.340
- Bret: OTHER THAN
THAT IT'S THE SAME.
- SO THE HOUSE IS THE SAME?

15:07.440 --> 15:10.577
- THIS STILL LOOKS--
- HOUSES LOOK KIND OF
DIFFERENT.

15:10.677 --> 15:14.114
- YOU WERE A FARMER,
THOUGH, WEREN'T YOU?
- NO, I WAS NEVER A FARMER.

15:14.214 --> 15:15.815
- YOU WEREN'T?
- WHO TOLD YOU
I WAS A FARMER?

15:15.915 --> 15:18.151
- I THOUGHT
YOU WERE A FARMER...
- NEVER EVER A FARMER.

15:18.251 --> 15:21.488
- ...BACK IN NEW ZEALAND.
- NO, NOT AT ALL.
I WAS A SHEPHERD.

15:21.588 --> 15:24.157
- A SHEPHERD?
- HE WAS A SHEPHERD,
NOT A FARMER.

15:24.257 --> 15:26.926
- OH, HERE'S ME--
- I CAN'T IMAGINE
THIS GUY FARMING.

15:27.027 --> 15:29.696
- I WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
- I DON'T KNOW WHERE
I GOT THAT IDEA.

15:29.796 --> 15:31.564
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU?
YOU'RE A FARMER.

15:31.664 --> 15:33.266
- NO, I WAS A SHEPHERD TOO.
- YEAH, JEMAINE'S A SHEPHERD.

15:33.366 --> 15:34.801
- BOTH SHEPHERDS?
- WE WERE BOTH SHEPHERDS.

15:34.901 --> 15:36.703
- THAT'S HOW WE KNOW EACH OTHER.
- WE MET EACH OTHER ONE TIME

15:36.803 --> 15:39.206
WHEN JEMAINE LOST
A COUPLE OF HIS SHEEP
AND I FOUND THEM.

15:39.306 --> 15:41.608
THEY HAD WANDERED OVER
TO BRET'S PADDOCK.

15:41.708 --> 15:45.178
WHAT ABOUT THE WISE OLD GUY
THAT YOU HAD TO FIND

15:45.278 --> 15:47.014
AND THEN HE TAUGHT YOU
TO FIGHT YOUR FATHER?

15:47.114 --> 15:48.248
I THINK
THAT'S "STAR WARS."

15:48.348 --> 15:50.517
ALL RIGHT,
SCRATCH THAT CHARACTER.

15:54.421 --> 15:55.989
YEAH, NO, WE WON'T
BE NEEDING THAT, GREG.

15:56.089 --> 15:58.591
THANKS, THOUGH.

16:02.996 --> 16:04.531
WE NEED TO TALK.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.566
WE HAD TO LEAVE
BECAUSE WE HAD REHEARSAL,

16:06.666 --> 16:08.768
- AND WE SNUCK OUT.
- IT'S NOT THAT.
IT'S NOT THAT.

16:08.868 --> 16:10.803
WE HAD TO BE THERE
BY 2:30, SO--

16:10.903 --> 16:14.341
DOUG AND I HAVE
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

16:14.441 --> 16:18.911
WE HAVE DECIDED
TO SPEND SOME TIME APART.

16:19.012 --> 16:20.480
- WHAT?
- OH.

16:20.580 --> 16:23.483
AND I KNOW THIS IS
GONNA BE HARD ON YOU TWO,

16:23.583 --> 16:26.219
OKAY, BUT WE WANT
YOU TO KNOW THAT
WE BOTH LOVE YOU

16:26.319 --> 16:29.156
VERY VERY VERY
VERY VERY MUCH.

16:29.256 --> 16:30.890
BUT WHERE WILL
WE LIVE?

16:30.990 --> 16:33.360
WELL, JUST BECAUSE
DOUG AND I DON'T WANNA

16:33.460 --> 16:37.464
BE TOGETHER ANYMORE
DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE DON'T
WANT TO BE WITH YOU.

16:37.564 --> 16:42.335
- THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU.
- WELL, ACTUALLY, MEL,
IT IS ABOUT THEM.

16:42.435 --> 16:45.572
DO NOT SAY THAT
IN FRONT OF THEM, DOUG.
IT'S DAMAGING.

16:47.174 --> 16:48.741
NOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT

16:48.841 --> 16:51.244
AND WE'VE DECIDED THAT,

16:51.344 --> 16:54.514
BRET, YOU WILL
STAY WITH ME

16:54.614 --> 16:57.684
AND, JEMAINE,
YOU WILL STAY WITH DOUG.

16:57.784 --> 16:59.919
BUT I WILL
FIGHT YOU, DOUG,

17:00.019 --> 17:01.254
AND I WILL
GET YOU BACK, JEMAINE.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.690
WHY CAN'T WE ALL
JUST STAY TOGETHER?

17:03.790 --> 17:08.027
OH, BRET, YOU'LL UNDERSTAND
WHEN YOU'RE OLDER, OKAY?

17:08.128 --> 17:11.598
- YOU'RE SO YOUNG.
- I'M 32.

17:11.698 --> 17:15.202
NOW, JEMAINE, DON'T WORRY.
YOU'LL STILL SEE A LOT OF ME.

17:15.302 --> 17:18.238
MMM, UM, YEAH, PROBABLY.

17:18.338 --> 17:20.073
AND BRET, YOU CAN
STILL SEE DOUG.

17:20.173 --> 17:22.109
- MEL...
- MM-HMM.

17:22.209 --> 17:25.312
...ARE YOU WEARING
MY SHIRT?

17:25.412 --> 17:27.814
YES, I AM.

17:27.914 --> 17:30.083
( folk music playing )

17:44.697 --> 17:46.666
( techno music playing )

17:49.136 --> 17:51.271
( folk music playing )

18:17.364 --> 18:20.200
OKAY, CAST MEETING.
BRET AS BRET.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.269
- YUP.
- JEMAINE AS JEMAINE.

18:22.369 --> 18:24.404
- YES.
- WRITER, DIRECTOR, PRODUCER

18:24.504 --> 18:26.473
- MURRAY HEWITT PRESENT.
- ( door opens )

18:26.573 --> 18:28.141
- OH, HELLO, GREG.
THAT LOOKS GOOD.
- HEY.

18:28.241 --> 18:30.277
- SHEEP.
- GOOD ONE.

18:30.377 --> 18:33.546
ALL RIGHT, NOW WE'VE GOT
SOME INDUSTRY TYPES
IN TONIGHT,

18:33.646 --> 18:35.648
- SO JUST BE AWARE OF THAT.
- RECORDING INDUSTRY?

18:35.748 --> 18:38.050
NO, THE EMBASSY INDUSTRY.

18:38.151 --> 18:40.119
WHAT, SOME OF YOUR MATES
FROM EMBASSIES?

18:40.220 --> 18:41.921
YEAH, DIFFERENT EMBASSIES.

18:42.021 --> 18:44.924
RIGHT, "LINES."
OKAY, HOW ARE YOU GOING
TO KNOW YOUR LINES?

18:45.024 --> 18:47.160
- WELL, WE'VE MEMORIZED THEM.
- YEAH, MEMORIZED THEM.

18:47.260 --> 18:50.029
- WHO TOLD YOU TO DO THAT?
- I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT YOU
WERE SUPPOSED TO DO.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.598
NO, YOU'VE GOTTA WRITE
YOUR LINES DOWN.

18:51.698 --> 18:53.666
- WHERE ARE WE GONNA WRITE THEM?
- ALL THE PROFESSIONAL ACTORS

18:53.766 --> 18:55.468
WRITE THEIR LINES DOWN
ON EACH OTHER'S CLOTHING.

18:55.568 --> 18:57.470
- DO THEY?
- YES, OF COURSE THEY DO.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.406
- REALLY?
- IF YOU GET STUCK
ON A LINE,

18:59.506 --> 19:02.108
YOU GO IN LIKE THIS.
"OH YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT."

19:02.209 --> 19:04.177
"YES, WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO GO THERE."

19:04.277 --> 19:06.179
WE'VE GOT
300 PAGES OF LINES.

19:06.279 --> 19:08.215
THE LONGER THE PLAY,
THE BIGGER THE SHIRT.

19:08.315 --> 19:11.418
YOU'LL ALWAYS NOTICE THAT--
BIG COSTUMES. WHY DO THEY
ALWAYS GO LIKE THIS?

19:11.518 --> 19:13.486
THERE'S LINES COVERED
IN ALL THE CLOTHING.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.488
- WELL, WE'VE MEMORIZED IT,
SO WE DON'T NEED IT.
- OKAY. I KNOW,

19:15.588 --> 19:17.957
BUT IT'S TOO LATE NOW.
I HOPE YOU CAN REMEMBER THEM.

19:18.057 --> 19:21.261
NOW, "BREATHING."
BRET, YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER
TO KEEP BREATHING, OKAY?

19:21.361 --> 19:22.762
- THE WHOLE TIME.
- MM-HMM. YEAH.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.731
YESTERDAY'S REHEARSAL
YOU GOT YOURSELF WORKED UP,

19:24.831 --> 19:26.666
YOU STOPPED BREATHING
AND YOU FAINTED.

19:26.766 --> 19:28.368
- NO, I DIDN'T.
- YOU WERE ON THE GROUND
THERE FOR A WHILE,

19:28.468 --> 19:30.237
- ABOUT FIVE MINUTES.
- YEAH, ABOUT FIVE MINUTES.

19:30.337 --> 19:32.972
- I REALLY GOT
BORED OF THAT BIT.
- UNCONSCIOUS FOR FIVE MINUTES?

19:33.072 --> 19:35.342
MM-HMM.
OKAY, AND FINALLY,

19:35.442 --> 19:37.644
JEMAINE,
JUST A LITTLE POINT
WITH YOUR ACTING.

19:37.744 --> 19:40.813
I'VE NOTICED YOUR ACTING
TENDS TO BE A BIT BORING.

19:40.913 --> 19:43.583
IT'S OKAY
FOR THE FIRST MINUTE,
THEN I KIND OF DRIFT OFF.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.485
SO KIND OF-- IF YOU CAN
TRY AND STOP THAT,
THAT'D BE GREAT.

19:45.585 --> 19:47.954
- HEY, MALCOLM.
- HEY.

19:48.054 --> 19:50.457
HAVE A GOOD ONE TONIGHT.
YOU'RE MY FAVORITE ACTOR.

19:51.991 --> 19:53.360
ALL RIGHT,
THIS IS IT!

19:53.460 --> 19:55.262
ONTO STAGE.
OFF YOU GO.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.564
HANG ON! YOU HAVEN'T
GOT YOUR COSTUMES ON!
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

19:57.664 --> 20:00.333
QUICKLY,
GET YOUR COSTUMES ON!
DOWN THAT WAY!

20:01.801 --> 20:03.670
( sheep bleating )

20:03.770 --> 20:07.407
JEMAINE, NOBODY WANTS
TO LISTEN TO THE MUSIC
OF A COUPLE OF SHEPHERDS.

20:07.507 --> 20:10.710
I KNOW OF A PLACE--

20:14.146 --> 20:16.383
SOMEWHERE WE CAN
PLAY MUSIC EVERY DAY

20:16.483 --> 20:18.318
WITHOUT HAVING
TO SHEPHERD.

20:18.418 --> 20:21.087
A PLACE CALLED...

20:21.187 --> 20:22.922
( piano playing )

20:23.022 --> 20:26.759
* AMERICA

20:28.227 --> 20:30.297
* I'VE BEEN SHEPHERDING
DAY AND NIGHT *

20:30.397 --> 20:33.032
* SAVING FOR THE FLIGHT
TO AMERICA *

20:33.132 --> 20:34.601
* AMERICA...

20:34.701 --> 20:37.537
- DON'T GO THERE!
- THEY'RE CRAZY!

20:37.637 --> 20:39.539
* IN THE PADDOCK
EVERY DAY *

20:39.639 --> 20:42.409
* TRYING TO WORK MY WAY
TO AMERICA... *

20:42.509 --> 20:45.745
- Woman: THEY'LL KILL YOUSE!
- Man: THEY HAVE GUNS!

20:52.352 --> 20:56.489
BRET, LOOK.
THERE SHE IS.

20:57.857 --> 21:00.360
IT'S THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL THING
I'VE EVER SEEN.

21:00.460 --> 21:05.298
* WELCOME TO THE LAND
OF OPPORTUNITY *

21:05.398 --> 21:09.369
* I AM THE STATUE
OF LIBERTY... *

21:09.469 --> 21:12.305
WELCOME.
WELCOME.
