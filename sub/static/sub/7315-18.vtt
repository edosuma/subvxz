Hey, now,
come on, wait up.

00:34.168 --> 00:37.102
Beer helps me dance,
it doesn't help me run.

00:37.104 --> 00:38.504
(chuckles)

00:38.506 --> 00:41.106
Special agent
dwayne pride.

00:41.108 --> 00:42.408
Friends call me king.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.476
Whoa.

00:44.478 --> 00:45.711
Did you feel that?

00:45.713 --> 00:48.280
Feel what, exactly?

00:48.282 --> 00:51.417
The undeniable
chemistry between us.

00:51.419 --> 00:53.419
(giggles)

00:53.421 --> 00:55.320
You haven't told me your name.

00:55.322 --> 00:57.356
(car alarm chirps)
linda.

00:58.591 --> 01:01.293
You coming or not...

01:01.295 --> 01:02.761
King?

01:02.763 --> 01:04.396
(laughs)

01:14.274 --> 01:17.409
"do you feel
the chemistry between us?"

01:19.345 --> 01:21.146
Who says that?

01:21.148 --> 01:22.481
(both laugh)

01:22.483 --> 01:24.283
It's called role play.

01:24.285 --> 01:26.185
I read about it
in a magazine.

01:26.187 --> 01:27.352
Thought it'd be fun.

01:27.354 --> 01:28.854
You didn't have fun?

01:28.856 --> 01:31.223
I did.

01:31.225 --> 01:32.491
Mm-hmm.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.359
A little.

01:34.361 --> 01:35.828
Sort of.

01:35.830 --> 01:38.197
Just a little?

01:38.199 --> 01:40.132
I don't need games, dwayne.

01:40.134 --> 01:41.433
We've been married 23 years.

01:41.435 --> 01:42.868
I need a little more
than that.

01:42.870 --> 01:45.170
(sighs)

01:45.172 --> 01:46.638
You know, I'm trying.

01:46.640 --> 01:50.609
Linda, we made a beautiful
daughter together.

01:50.611 --> 01:53.312
We can at least be
civil to each other.

01:55.248 --> 01:56.815
You need to go home.

01:56.817 --> 01:59.218
I am home.

01:59.220 --> 02:02.588
I meant your apartment.

02:02.590 --> 02:03.722
Or office.

02:03.724 --> 02:06.558
Or... Whatever it is
you call it.

02:07.760 --> 02:10.295
Sweetheart...

02:10.297 --> 02:11.763
What are we doing?

02:11.765 --> 02:13.599
Come park with me at the river.

02:13.601 --> 02:15.234
We'll watch the sunrise.

02:15.236 --> 02:16.468
Dwayne...

02:16.470 --> 02:19.138
We'll get coffee and
eggs at elizabeth's.

02:19.140 --> 02:21.206
And that good
brown toast you like.

02:24.377 --> 02:26.578
(cell phone ringing)

02:34.220 --> 02:35.854
(sighs)

02:35.856 --> 02:37.923
(ringing continues)

02:40.527 --> 02:42.861
This is pride.

03:01.514 --> 03:03.582
Morning, agent pride.

03:03.584 --> 03:05.350
Morning, fellas.
Sir.

03:06.419 --> 03:08.220
Coffee, christopher.

03:08.222 --> 03:10.455
Appreciate it, king.

03:10.457 --> 03:12.357
How long you been up,
my brother?

03:12.359 --> 03:14.359
Ain't been to bed yet.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.195
You look fantastic.

03:16.197 --> 03:17.496
You're lying.
Through my teeth.

03:17.498 --> 03:19.565
What do we got?

03:23.203 --> 03:24.770
Son, you need me
to ask you again?

03:24.772 --> 03:27.673
No, sir.

03:27.675 --> 03:29.474
Shrimpers found him
by the docks.

03:29.476 --> 03:32.411
Fish and crabs
been gnawing on him.

03:32.413 --> 03:33.845
Throat's been cut, too-- deep.

03:33.847 --> 03:35.447
Almost to the bone.

03:37.317 --> 03:38.684
Wearing navy cufflinks.

03:38.686 --> 03:41.386
He's a retired
navy reserve commander.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.422
Guest on the uss <i>ulysses.</i>

03:43.424 --> 03:45.557
Tiger cruise docked
local for shore leave.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.459
He was probably partying
with the crew all night.

03:47.461 --> 03:49.695
Vic have a name?

03:49.697 --> 03:52.431
I should have told you
over the phone,

03:52.433 --> 03:55.968
But I wanted you
to see in person.

03:57.904 --> 04:00.572
Deputies pulled his wallet
out of the drink.

04:00.574 --> 04:03.942
Found his retired nis creds.

04:13.686 --> 04:17.623
Mclane being a congressman,
fbi's on its way.

04:25.698 --> 04:28.400
Dan taught me everything I know.

04:31.904 --> 04:34.773
He was family.

04:42.849 --> 04:44.750
Take him to the morgue.

04:44.752 --> 04:47.919
Got to wait on the fbi
and the medical examiner.

04:51.457 --> 04:53.992
I'm not waiting on anybody.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.727
I owe him that respect.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.929
Bag him and go.

05:02.335 --> 05:04.369
That you, king?

05:06.406 --> 05:10.542
Me and special agent gibbs
got some catching up to do.

05:44.911 --> 05:47.112
Mcgee: Oh, you think
we should help her?

05:47.114 --> 05:49.514
Do I look like
the auto club to you?

05:49.516 --> 05:51.583
Well, we could
call the motor pool.

05:51.585 --> 05:53.685
No, let's just let
our little grease probie

05:53.687 --> 05:55.487
Do what she does.
(grunts)

05:55.489 --> 05:57.356
Did she just twerk?

05:57.358 --> 05:58.657
I heard that.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.125
(sighs)
oh!

06:00.127 --> 06:02.361
Cute vest.
Very michelin man.

06:02.363 --> 06:06.598
Yeah, well, I used to watch my
dad take apart tractor engines.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.066
So you think you
got it figured out?

06:08.068 --> 06:09.835
Oh. Yeah, no, piece
of cake. The...

06:09.837 --> 06:11.737
Whatchamacallit
just disconnected

06:11.739 --> 06:12.738
From the thingamajig.

06:12.740 --> 06:16.074
No, really, come here.
Just see for yourself.

06:16.076 --> 06:18.043
I'll just keep my nose
out of your whatchamacallit,

06:18.045 --> 06:19.478
If you don't mind.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.679
Hey.
Hey.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.114
Hey, boss.
There a problem?

06:22.116 --> 06:23.448
Um...

06:23.450 --> 06:25.684
Our new agent has
a little engine trouble.

06:25.686 --> 06:29.154
Uh, it's pretty
self-explanatory, really.

06:29.156 --> 06:31.723
Check to see if that
little gizmo there

06:31.725 --> 06:33.792
Is attached to that...
Other doodleybop?

06:33.794 --> 06:35.127
Bishop:
Mm, not yet.

06:35.129 --> 06:36.528
You think
that'll do it?

06:36.530 --> 06:38.830
If you spit on it.
Sometimes that works.

06:38.832 --> 06:39.631
All right.

06:39.633 --> 06:40.832
Oh, come on.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.000
(cell phone ringing)

06:42.002 --> 06:43.935
Yeah. Yeah, it's gibbs.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.637
Vance:
Gibbs.

06:45.639 --> 06:47.773
There's somebody upstairs
looking for you.

06:47.775 --> 06:50.142
Uh, yeah, on my way, director.

06:50.144 --> 06:52.878
Thanks.

06:53.780 --> 06:54.913
Gibbs.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.482
Think you two
know each other.

07:01.854 --> 07:03.688
Hello, my brother.

07:06.993 --> 07:08.493
Press won't leave it alone.

07:08.495 --> 07:10.162
Yeah, I know.
I saw the news, king.

07:11.164 --> 07:12.864
I...

07:12.866 --> 07:15.000
I just ran into mac
a few weeks ago.

07:15.002 --> 07:17.869
What's the status
of the remains?

07:17.871 --> 07:20.605
Right now, the body's with
the jefferson parish coroner.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.841
Special agent lasalle
is following leads back home.

07:22.843 --> 07:25.777
Any idea what the congressman
was doing in new orleans?

07:25.779 --> 07:27.078
Tiger cruise, director,

07:27.080 --> 07:29.481
With some
campaign investors.

07:29.483 --> 07:31.616
Bunch of midlifers
playing battleship.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.852
Dan liked to show
he still had some navy pull.

07:33.854 --> 07:36.655
Since he's running
for reelection, I...

07:36.657 --> 07:39.024
I got a feeling
it's politically motivated.

07:39.026 --> 07:40.959
That's why I came to d.C.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.662
Need your help
looking for a connection.

07:43.664 --> 07:45.664
Secnav?

07:45.666 --> 07:47.966
In addition to his
current position,

07:47.968 --> 07:50.869
Dan mclane was a
dedicated nis agent.

07:50.871 --> 07:53.538
Secretary porter
would like this

07:53.540 --> 07:55.207
To be a joint investigation
with the fbi.

07:55.209 --> 07:56.942
Pride:
Sir,

07:56.944 --> 08:00.011
Special agent lasalle and I
can handle things on our own.

08:00.013 --> 08:02.214
Pride, we've been
down this road before.

08:02.216 --> 08:03.982
My city, my way.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.050
Not this time.

08:05.052 --> 08:06.184
Your sac out of chicago,

08:06.186 --> 08:07.786
Special agent barclay,

08:07.788 --> 08:09.187
Is sending
additional manpower

08:09.189 --> 08:11.490
To louisiana to assist.

08:11.492 --> 08:13.258
An interrogation expert,
to be exact.

08:13.260 --> 08:14.759
Don't need one.

08:14.761 --> 08:17.229
Agent lasalle and I
can question suspects just fine.

08:17.231 --> 08:19.264
Recent flaws in your technique
would suggest otherwise.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.733
I only punched that xo once.

08:22.935 --> 08:24.269
Once was enough.

08:24.271 --> 08:27.038
King, where'd you say
you were staying

08:27.040 --> 08:28.106
When you're here?

08:29.075 --> 08:31.676
You had to ask?

08:31.678 --> 08:34.279
Tony: A living legend
has entered the building.

08:34.281 --> 08:36.181
Who? Elvis?

08:37.784 --> 08:40.852
Another member
of the original fed five.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.087
Sir, we've heard
the stories.

08:42.089 --> 08:44.022
Probably all true...
Hi.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.223
...But let's reminisce
another time.

08:45.225 --> 08:47.025
Special agent dinozzo.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.960
Oh, hey, look at that.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.862
Unlike our beloved mike franks,

08:50.864 --> 08:52.097
You seem to have
all your digits.

08:52.099 --> 08:53.865
Scars are all on the inside.

08:55.067 --> 08:56.301
Where do we start, gibbs?

08:56.303 --> 08:58.770
We're here to back up
the new orleans office.

08:58.772 --> 09:00.772
(phone ringing)
I have known ssa pride

09:00.774 --> 09:02.140
For 30 years.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.775
Trust him with my life.

09:03.777 --> 09:06.077
You can trust
him, too.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.046
Boss, special agent
pride has a call

09:08.048 --> 09:09.981
Coming in
through mtac.
All right, let's go.

09:09.983 --> 09:10.982
Dinozzo,

09:10.984 --> 09:12.317
Come on, you're with us.

09:12.319 --> 09:14.586
Call you back.

09:17.056 --> 09:19.591
Sorry to interrupt, king,

09:19.593 --> 09:21.293
But we got a little bit
of an issue.

09:21.295 --> 09:23.595
Did he just call his
boss "king," boss?

09:23.597 --> 09:26.097
Pride, the damn fbi burst
in here claiming mclane

09:26.099 --> 09:27.599
Is solely their jurisdiction.

09:27.601 --> 09:29.067
They just carried him
out of here

09:29.069 --> 09:30.335
Like an overstuffed
sack of potatoes.

09:30.337 --> 09:31.970
Who was it, loretta?

09:31.972 --> 09:33.738
Agent doyle
and her flying monkeys.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.607
I was in the middle
of my trace exam.

09:35.609 --> 09:37.809
I barely had time
to snap my gloves off.

09:37.811 --> 09:39.945
Dr. Wade, special agent gibbs.

09:39.947 --> 09:41.012
Where did they go?

09:41.014 --> 09:42.614
When I asked,

09:42.616 --> 09:44.649
She told me it was
none of my damn business.

09:44.651 --> 09:47.085
Fbi's hiding something.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.987
I smell a conspiracy.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.622
What a surprise.

09:50.624 --> 09:52.857
Something stinks in washington.

10:02.802 --> 10:05.837
It's no secret
mclane was fed five.

10:05.839 --> 10:08.974
He and franks-- they
weren't just your bosses,

10:08.976 --> 10:10.175
They were the best.

10:10.177 --> 10:12.177
What do you think
he got mixed up in?

10:12.179 --> 10:15.947
Nothing dirty,
if that's what you're asking.

10:15.949 --> 10:19.384
King, remember my last trip
down to jazz fest?

10:19.386 --> 10:21.786
Breakfast at mother's,
dinner at commander's palace.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.254
What I wouldn't give

10:23.256 --> 10:26.191
Right now for an oyster
po'boy from parkway.

10:26.193 --> 10:28.326
Help us out,
my brother.

10:28.328 --> 10:30.228
There's a central grocery
muffuletta in your future

10:30.230 --> 10:32.297
That your colon
won't ever forget.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.232
(laughs)

10:34.234 --> 10:36.801
(elevator bell dings)

10:36.803 --> 10:37.736
All right,

10:39.672 --> 10:41.272
That was
special agent lasalle.

10:41.274 --> 10:43.675
Still canvassing
the quarters and treme?

10:43.677 --> 10:46.277
Yes, sir. He also made
some local introductions.

10:46.279 --> 10:49.147
Connected us to security cameras
in new orleans.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.849
Nopd's street cams are weak.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.250
That's why we're going
for the private systems first.

10:52.252 --> 10:54.686
Primarily bars and strip clubs.

10:54.688 --> 10:56.154
Nothing like watching
tourists get drunk

10:56.156 --> 10:58.023
On hurricanes and
mint juleps.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.424
I don't get drunk.

10:59.426 --> 11:01.960
I'm sorry, I didn't understand
what you said.

11:01.962 --> 11:04.229
Um, it's physically impossible
for me.

11:04.231 --> 11:05.930
I tried in college.

11:05.932 --> 11:07.832
Can't. Ask my husband.

11:07.834 --> 11:10.101
There are a lot of things
I want to ask your husband.

11:11.070 --> 11:12.370
Mcgee: Boss, I think
I got something.

11:12.372 --> 11:15.840
The hotel monteleone's
carousel bar.

11:15.842 --> 11:18.009
Rotates like an old
merry-go-round.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.311
That ought to be good
after a few vieux carrés.

11:20.313 --> 11:21.413
Give you the spins.

11:22.815 --> 11:25.083
At 1:12 a.M.,
congressman mclane was seen

11:25.085 --> 11:27.152
With this woman.

11:27.154 --> 11:29.454
Any chance you recognize her,
agent pride?

11:29.456 --> 11:33.425
Know a lot of working girls
who frequent the hotels.

11:36.762 --> 11:38.963
Dear sweet sally hammond.

11:40.299 --> 11:41.399
And mac.

11:43.202 --> 11:45.336
Just never thought
that he...

11:45.338 --> 11:48.907
Bishop, interstate and local.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.775
Get a bolo out, find her.

11:50.777 --> 11:53.078
Okay.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.213
(playing jazz music)

12:10.863 --> 12:12.931
Agent lasalle, help
yourself to a beignet.

12:14.934 --> 12:17.302
You're missing out.
Jay made these special.

12:17.304 --> 12:19.137
What'd y'all do with my body?

12:19.139 --> 12:22.273
There were
unforeseen complications.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.142
United states congressman
was murdered.

12:24.144 --> 12:27.045
Case has roots that run
all the way to d.C.

12:27.047 --> 12:30.048
Mclane was an nis agent first.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.217
Those roots run deeper.

12:32.219 --> 12:34.853
Let me ask you something,
christopher.

12:34.855 --> 12:37.489
We've known each other
an awful long time.

12:37.491 --> 12:39.858
Why are you being so stubborn
about this?

12:39.860 --> 12:42.327
I'm just doing my job.
Y'all stole him.

12:42.329 --> 12:44.395
Let the bureau handle this one.

12:44.397 --> 12:45.764
I can't.

12:45.766 --> 12:47.432
Doesn't ncis have
enough on its plate?

12:47.434 --> 12:49.134
Hell, there are
only the two of you.

12:49.136 --> 12:50.468
Don't you worry about us.

12:50.470 --> 12:53.204
Secnav wants this to be
a joint investigation.

12:53.206 --> 12:55.406
I don't work for secnav.

12:55.408 --> 12:57.976
Mclane meant something to pride.

12:57.978 --> 13:00.378
A dead congressman
means a lot to us.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.147
Lynette, you're messing
with my business.

13:02.149 --> 13:05.283
You still volunteering on the
weekends down at the hospital?

13:05.285 --> 13:07.352
The kids keep me honest.

13:07.354 --> 13:09.954
They keep my head on straight.
You should try it sometime.

13:09.956 --> 13:12.390
Don't you get all righteous
and clark kent with me,

13:12.392 --> 13:16.461
Look, I need you
to let me back in on this.

13:16.463 --> 13:19.097
Can't. Not yet.

13:19.099 --> 13:21.166
But as soon as we have
the answers we need,

13:21.168 --> 13:22.400
You'll be the first to know.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.369
You know I'm gonna
keep fighting.

13:24.371 --> 13:27.238
You think I'd expect otherwise?

13:31.377 --> 13:34.078
Gibbs:
You didn't have to cook.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.480
Clears my head.

13:36.448 --> 13:38.416
You come up with anything?

13:38.418 --> 13:40.451
Just thinking
about the old team.

13:40.453 --> 13:43.521
First mike goes
down, then dan.

13:43.523 --> 13:47.392
Best damn field
agents nis ever had.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.261
(bottles clink)

13:53.098 --> 13:54.499
Fornell:
Mmm.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.501
Smells good. What's for dinner?

13:58.470 --> 14:00.004
Red beans and rice.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.306
Must be Monday.

14:02.441 --> 14:03.575
Got some good news.

14:03.577 --> 14:05.043
Found mclane's remains

14:05.045 --> 14:06.511
At the jackson, mississippi
morgue.

14:07.913 --> 14:10.215
Doyle wanted to do
her own forensic exam.

14:10.217 --> 14:11.382
Why?

14:11.384 --> 14:13.218
Not sure.

14:13.220 --> 14:15.553
But after talking to vance,

14:15.555 --> 14:18.523
My director is willing to
keep this a joint investigation,

14:18.525 --> 14:21.359
As long as you guys
keep me in the loop.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.394
Ducky needs to do
his own autopsy.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.363
I'm not gonna argue.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.232
Body's on its way.

14:27.234 --> 14:30.468
The nola fbi office
has been pulling

14:30.470 --> 14:33.438
All these old murder files,
stuff from way back.

14:33.440 --> 14:37.141
Any idea what they
might be looking for?

14:37.143 --> 14:38.877
(cell phone ringing)

14:41.146 --> 14:43.314
Hey. Dinozzo.

14:44.583 --> 14:46.618
Mm-hmm.

14:46.620 --> 14:48.987
Mmm.

14:48.989 --> 14:51.322
Okay, thank you.

14:51.324 --> 14:54.592
Bolo got a hit
at a virginia rest stop.

14:54.594 --> 14:56.361
Sally hammond was
driving north on 95.

14:56.363 --> 14:58.296
Trooper's bringing her in.

14:58.298 --> 15:01.599
You still got that magic touch,
d-man?

15:01.601 --> 15:04.602
You kidding?

15:08.240 --> 15:09.908
Ms. Sally hammond.

15:09.910 --> 15:11.976
Oh, sugar, you didn't have
to drive this far

15:11.978 --> 15:14.612
To spend some quality time
with me.

15:14.614 --> 15:16.681
Mm.

15:18.050 --> 15:20.218
You know this man?

15:20.220 --> 15:23.388
Yeah, that's the,
uh, older john

15:23.390 --> 15:25.623
That I was paid
to talk to the other night.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.625
You just talk?
(chuckles)

15:27.627 --> 15:29.961
Well, sometimes talking's
all they want to do.

15:31.931 --> 15:35.433
Okay. The truth is, some fella
offered me three grand

15:35.435 --> 15:37.435
To carry on for a few minutes

15:37.437 --> 15:39.570
And then to leave new orleans
for a week,

15:39.572 --> 15:41.673
No strings attached.

15:41.675 --> 15:44.609
You know, a-a woman like me
don't get offered

15:44.611 --> 15:46.611
That kind of money often.

15:53.719 --> 15:56.187
(gasps)

15:56.189 --> 15:58.356
Oh.

15:58.358 --> 16:00.191
Oh, poor baby.

16:00.193 --> 16:02.727
You were the last person to
see the congressman alive.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.262
Congressman?

16:04.264 --> 16:08.266
N-nobody said nothing
about no congressman.

16:08.268 --> 16:11.669
Sally... Tell us
who paid you.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.538
I told you.

16:13.540 --> 16:16.074
It was all done with cash
left in an envelope.

16:16.076 --> 16:18.676
They set you up, wanted to make
it look like you were running.

16:18.678 --> 16:22.313
I was driving north
to see family.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.349
All we did was talk. I swear.

16:25.684 --> 16:27.552
I didn't kill that man.

16:27.554 --> 16:30.088
Come on, I ain't kill nobody.

16:40.733 --> 16:43.034
Mcgee:
Okay, thanks very much.

16:43.036 --> 16:46.204
The two calls
sally told us about were made

16:46.206 --> 16:48.206
From a disposable
burn phone.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.475
Whoever did this
knew how to cover their tracks.

16:50.477 --> 16:51.642
She was a distraction
to keep everyone

16:51.644 --> 16:52.677
Looking in the wrong direction.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.779
How's your love
life, dinozzo?

16:54.781 --> 16:56.080
Huh?

16:56.082 --> 16:58.182
You still seeing the secretary?

16:58.751 --> 16:59.684
He means andrea.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.085
Andrea? Hmm.

17:01.087 --> 17:02.453
Who's andrea?

17:02.455 --> 17:04.088
"ahn-drea."

17:04.090 --> 17:06.257
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, she's, um...

17:06.259 --> 17:09.193
I mean, it's kind of
on an as-needed basis.

17:09.195 --> 17:11.262
Friend with benefits?

17:11.264 --> 17:12.630
Yeah, well, those aren't
benefits like dental insurance.

17:12.632 --> 17:13.531
(chuckles)

17:13.533 --> 17:15.133
Who on capitol hill

17:15.135 --> 17:16.200
Doesn't want mclane reelected?
(phone chimes)

17:16.202 --> 17:18.202
Need that answer now.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.138
On it.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.639
The <i>ulysses</i> is still
on lockdown.
(cell phone ringing)

17:21.641 --> 17:23.808
Lasalle's headed over
to talk to the crew now.

17:23.810 --> 17:26.144
Yeah, duck.

17:26.146 --> 17:27.812
You want us both?

17:27.814 --> 17:29.147
Yeah.

17:29.149 --> 17:31.616
Come on. Abby wants you
in the lab.

17:31.618 --> 17:32.650
I got ducky in autopsy.

17:37.122 --> 17:39.190
(elevator bell dings)

17:44.797 --> 17:48.066
(groans)
incomprehensible.

17:48.068 --> 17:49.367
Duck?
(sighs)

17:49.369 --> 17:51.669
It's so frustrating

17:51.671 --> 17:53.404
And positively
unprofessional.

17:53.406 --> 17:54.705
Ducky.

17:54.707 --> 17:57.141
Whoever concluded
the congressman's autopsy

17:57.143 --> 17:58.576
For the fbi in mississippi

17:58.578 --> 18:01.212
Did a
horrendous job.

18:01.214 --> 18:02.480
The dermis around the neck wound

18:02.482 --> 18:06.117
Is so compromised, it's
now virtually impossible

18:06.119 --> 18:08.386
To tell what kind
of knife was used.

18:08.388 --> 18:10.555
Jefferson parish coroner
never even got started.

18:10.557 --> 18:14.125
Loretta wade is a very
competent medical examiner.

18:14.127 --> 18:18.096
She would never make a-a
mistake this egregious.

18:18.098 --> 18:21.866
I'm not even sure that a
doctor did that butchery.

18:21.868 --> 18:24.202
The fbi screw it up?

18:24.204 --> 18:26.270
Covered it up,
more likely.

18:26.272 --> 18:31.242
Yeah, but why would the
fbi intentionally delay

18:31.244 --> 18:33.744
A high-profile
murder investigation?

18:33.746 --> 18:36.247
Murder of a congressman, duck.

18:36.249 --> 18:38.749
Yeah, well,
this man was a friend

18:38.751 --> 18:41.252
And a highly decorated
federal agent.

18:41.254 --> 18:44.422
Loretta wade and I
will compare notes.

18:44.424 --> 18:46.557
They think we can't do
another autopsy?

18:46.559 --> 18:48.426
(chuckles)

18:48.428 --> 18:50.595
Well, you bloody
well watch us.

18:53.365 --> 18:55.433
(elevator bell dings)

18:58.804 --> 19:01.339
Feels like home.

19:01.341 --> 19:03.374
Coo-wee!

19:03.376 --> 19:04.842
Dwayne cassius pride.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.377
(chuckles)
hey.

19:06.379 --> 19:08.513
Hey, how's
your aunt gert?

19:08.515 --> 19:11.349
She's still enjoying that
roman candy that you gave her.

19:11.351 --> 19:13.351
You come from good people, boo.
Mm.

19:13.353 --> 19:15.253
Now, what you got for me?

19:15.255 --> 19:16.888
Well, I'm waiting for
ducky's autopsy results,

19:16.890 --> 19:18.422
Or lack thereof, but...

19:18.424 --> 19:20.391
Since I know the area,
I wanted to show you something.

19:20.393 --> 19:23.394
Here.

19:23.396 --> 19:25.363
Now hold on tight; like
when we're going after

19:25.365 --> 19:28.266
Redfish and black
drum back home.

19:28.268 --> 19:29.400
I'm good for a fight.

19:29.402 --> 19:30.601
All right.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.236
Now make-believe
that you're in lafitte,

19:32.238 --> 19:33.938
Where mclane's body was found.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.339
You ready?

19:35.341 --> 19:36.574
Okay.

19:39.878 --> 19:42.413
(chuckles)

19:42.415 --> 19:44.849
Nothing on the line,
but the current's strong.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.551
Exactly.

19:46.553 --> 19:49.453
So, m-mclane's body
was not dumped at the marina.

19:49.455 --> 19:51.556
I mean, based on the
estimated time of death

19:51.558 --> 19:54.926
And unusually strong currents
and stormy weather that night,

19:54.928 --> 19:57.895
I think the point of origin
was further upriver.

19:57.897 --> 20:00.765
The wetlands at barataria.

20:01.934 --> 20:05.536
I need to steal you
and bring you home.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.371
(chuckles)

20:09.308 --> 20:11.509
Bye.

20:22.254 --> 20:24.222
Excuse me.

20:24.224 --> 20:25.456
Who are you exactly?

20:25.458 --> 20:27.792
That depends. Who are you?

20:27.794 --> 20:30.428
Well, I work here.
I'm special agent lasalle.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.697
They didn't tell you
I was coming, did they?

20:32.699 --> 20:34.298
No, ma'am.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.000
Did you just call me "ma'am"?

20:36.002 --> 20:37.468
Yes, ma'am.

20:37.470 --> 20:40.404
I'm brody,
from the great lakes office.

20:40.406 --> 20:43.374
Well, sac said he was sending
down some extra manpower.

20:43.376 --> 20:45.743
You got woman-power instead.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.346
Well, we don't necessarily need
the help,

20:48.348 --> 20:50.881
But, uh...
You're welcome to stay.

20:50.883 --> 20:53.718
How many agents do you
have down here, full-time?

20:53.720 --> 20:54.986
Two.

20:54.988 --> 20:56.454
You need the help.

20:58.590 --> 20:59.724
Mmm.

20:59.726 --> 21:01.425
It's a good sandwich.

21:01.427 --> 21:02.593
You hungry?

21:02.595 --> 21:04.495
Is pride back from d.C. Yet?

21:04.497 --> 21:07.431
He's still following
leads up north.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.033
You look familiar.

21:09.035 --> 21:10.601
You ever tailgate
at a saints game?

21:10.603 --> 21:13.371
I don't tailgate.

21:13.373 --> 21:15.906
I do like a nice picnic
in grant park, though.

21:15.908 --> 21:18.609
Is that a ball field?
Hardly.

21:18.611 --> 21:21.445
Hey, what's a three-letter
word for "mistake"?

21:21.447 --> 21:22.780
What?

21:22.782 --> 21:24.949
I do crossword puzzles
in my head, and I'm stuck.

21:24.951 --> 21:27.351
Three letters. Hmm.

21:27.353 --> 21:28.786
F-b-I.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.554
Not it.

21:31.890 --> 21:34.025
Brody.

21:34.027 --> 21:35.626
Agent afloat
on the moultrie

21:35.628 --> 21:37.628
In 2010
when that terrorist I.E.D. Hit.

21:37.630 --> 21:40.498
You know, I'd really rather not
talk about that.

21:43.468 --> 21:45.336
Well, hey, I'm headed over
to the <i>ulysses</i>

21:45.338 --> 21:46.871
To go through
mclane's quarters.

21:46.873 --> 21:49.006
I could use
a second pair of eyes.

21:49.008 --> 21:50.708
I've got two.

21:50.710 --> 21:53.544
Well, all right, then.

21:54.746 --> 21:57.515
Oh, gibbs, I just pulled copies
of the homicide files

21:57.517 --> 21:58.883
Fbi agent doyle requested.

21:58.885 --> 22:02.019
Uh, murders all tied to
victor lorta,

22:02.021 --> 22:03.888
The salesman
the fed five convicted

22:03.890 --> 22:05.523
As the privileged killer.

22:05.525 --> 22:07.925
What was
your involvement exactly?

22:09.895 --> 22:12.697
We were the probies
along for the ride.

22:13.799 --> 22:15.032
Bust went to franks and mclane.

22:15.034 --> 22:16.534
They put it together.

22:16.536 --> 22:18.869
So why was he called
"privileged"?

22:18.871 --> 22:20.071
Gibbs:
Lorta's victims

22:20.073 --> 22:22.373
Were either military
or public servants

22:22.375 --> 22:24.075
Who made him feel
safe and secure.

22:24.077 --> 22:26.544
Pride: Lorta believed he was
<i>privileged</i> to live here.

22:26.546 --> 22:29.013
Envied and hated
them for it.

22:29.015 --> 22:30.981
Mclane was the one who
put it all together.

22:30.983 --> 22:33.584
He's the one who connected it
to lorta. Trial went fast.

22:33.586 --> 22:34.985
Evidence was
overwhelming.

22:34.987 --> 22:36.821
Pride:
Lorta got sick in prison.

22:36.823 --> 22:39.357
Claimed he was innocent of the
murders till the day he died.

22:39.359 --> 22:41.092
Why reopen old case files?

22:41.094 --> 22:42.360
Tony:
Just had lunch

22:42.362 --> 22:45.596
With the lovely andrea
at the capitol.

22:45.598 --> 22:49.467
Chicken parmesan, a little
caesar salad with anchovies.

22:49.469 --> 22:52.737
Um, mclane recently
burned some bridges.

22:52.739 --> 22:54.505
He was trying to stop

22:54.507 --> 22:55.840
A new power plant
from being built

22:55.842 --> 22:57.608
Near a north carolina
wildlife refuge. Clicker.

22:57.610 --> 22:58.676
Incoming.

22:58.678 --> 23:00.544
Tom speakman,

23:00.546 --> 23:02.380
A d.C. Lobbyist for
the power company,

23:02.382 --> 23:03.781
Called in favors

23:03.783 --> 23:05.516
Around washington
to discredit the congressman.

23:05.518 --> 23:07.852
Speakman made
it personal.

23:07.854 --> 23:11.622
Mclane even looked into filing
a restraining order against him.

23:11.624 --> 23:13.691
Can you put speakman
in new orleans

23:13.693 --> 23:15.459
The night mac was killed?

23:15.461 --> 23:16.861
No, but take a look at this.

23:16.863 --> 23:19.497
Speakman has a nephew,
abraham lycek,

23:19.499 --> 23:21.599
Currently a petty officer

23:21.601 --> 23:22.666
Second class on the <i>ulysses.</i>

23:24.403 --> 23:27.438
It looks like lycek has
some anger-management issues.

23:27.440 --> 23:28.873
Two arrests. Charges
dropped both times.

23:28.875 --> 23:30.975
Mcgee:
Not to mention

23:30.977 --> 23:32.176
Some serious credit card debt.

23:32.178 --> 23:34.111
Lycek is in desperate need
of cash.

23:34.113 --> 23:36.414
That's location,
history and motive.

23:36.416 --> 23:37.481
I'll call lasalle.

23:37.483 --> 23:38.816
Lobbyist?

23:38.818 --> 23:41.485
At a fundraising luncheon
in chevy chase.

23:47.592 --> 23:49.794
Well, I need another
appendage for that.
(laughter)

23:49.796 --> 23:51.195
Tom speakman?

23:51.197 --> 23:54.632
What? I wasn't generous
enough at lunchtime?

23:54.634 --> 23:56.100
Ncis.

23:56.102 --> 23:58.903
Get back to
work, everybody.

23:58.905 --> 24:01.439
I'll call you later.

24:01.441 --> 24:03.441
So, what is this?

24:03.443 --> 24:04.942
Sir, we're investigating
the murder

24:04.944 --> 24:06.610
Of congressman dan mclane.

24:06.612 --> 24:10.648
Who knew today would be such a
great day for american justice,

24:10.650 --> 24:11.715
Huh?

24:11.717 --> 24:16.620
We need you to come with us,
answer some questions.

24:16.622 --> 24:18.556
Sorry. Not gonna happen.

24:18.558 --> 24:20.558
Since when is it against the law
to dislike somebody's politics?

24:20.560 --> 24:23.928
It's not... But the man's dead.

24:23.930 --> 24:25.463
And that's for the best.

24:25.465 --> 24:26.697
Look, I'm a lobbyist.

24:26.699 --> 24:28.766
People pay me to
change public opinion.

24:28.768 --> 24:32.670
The retirement home than he
was the halls of congress.

24:32.672 --> 24:34.505
His term couldn't end
fast enough.

24:34.507 --> 24:35.706
Gibbs...

24:35.708 --> 24:37.842
Oh, yeah. I know. Making room.

24:37.844 --> 24:39.243
Elected officials
need to be strong.

24:39.245 --> 24:40.644
Mclane was anything but.

24:40.646 --> 24:44.081
I think you're being
a little disrespectful.

24:45.083 --> 24:46.550
I think he deserved it.

24:48.053 --> 24:49.119
Uh-oh.

24:52.257 --> 24:53.257
(groans)

24:53.259 --> 24:54.859
Kind of old school.

24:54.861 --> 24:57.862
Think you made your
point there, king?

24:57.864 --> 24:59.964
Old school still works
in louisiana.

24:59.966 --> 25:02.066
(chuckles):
Yeah.

25:02.068 --> 25:04.001
Yeah, it still works here, too.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.769
(chuckles)

25:15.080 --> 25:17.147
(groaning)

25:19.084 --> 25:21.819
How you feeling
there, pal?

25:21.821 --> 25:24.154
You know, I was just trying
to keep you safe.

25:24.156 --> 25:25.723
Cars whipping through
the parking lot.

25:25.725 --> 25:28.158
I didn't want you to get hurt.

25:30.262 --> 25:32.830
Best photo
the congressman ever took.

25:32.832 --> 25:36.267
See... Now, why say
a thing like that?

25:36.269 --> 25:38.269
I know you think I killed him.

25:38.271 --> 25:41.272
How could I? I was here
in d.C. The whole time.

25:41.274 --> 25:43.574
Could have
hired someone.
Didn't.

25:43.576 --> 25:47.177
If we ask your nephew on the
<i>ulysses</i> the same question?

25:51.216 --> 25:53.050
You wouldn't mind that much,
would you?

25:57.689 --> 26:00.658
Lasalle:
<i>Breathe, petty officer.</i>

26:00.660 --> 26:03.160
Special agent brody
doesn't bite.

26:03.162 --> 26:05.229
Well, sometimes,
but it never leaves a scar.

26:05.231 --> 26:07.231
We just want to talk.

26:07.233 --> 26:09.867
Did you meet
congressman mclane?

26:09.869 --> 26:12.236
Uh-huh. Whole crew did.

26:12.238 --> 26:15.306
We need you to confirm your
whereabouts while on liberty.

26:17.242 --> 26:18.642
Sir, I was drunk.

26:18.644 --> 26:19.710
Witnesses would help.

26:19.712 --> 26:21.912
They were drunk, too.

26:21.914 --> 26:25.249
Think, abe.

26:27.152 --> 26:28.752
Girls.
Mm.

26:28.754 --> 26:30.821
Guys.

26:30.823 --> 26:33.157
Guys who look
like girls.

26:33.159 --> 26:35.225
Maybe you ticked someone off.

26:35.227 --> 26:38.262
Word is,
you're pretty good at that.

26:38.264 --> 26:41.899
Too bad I didn't run into you
a couple of nights ago.

26:43.768 --> 26:45.302
Would've had some fun.

26:45.304 --> 26:46.804
(both chuckle)

26:53.979 --> 26:57.314
I got a whole new respect
for the great lakes office.

27:11.329 --> 27:15.132
Yeah, of course I know
about the restraining order.

27:15.134 --> 27:17.267
Uh... You don't get it.

27:17.269 --> 27:18.869
I wanted mclane to blow;
I wanted him

27:18.871 --> 27:19.870
To look unstable.

27:19.872 --> 27:21.105
It's my job to push people.

27:21.107 --> 27:23.774
You got any sevens?

27:23.776 --> 27:25.876
Go fish.

27:25.878 --> 27:27.711
What the hell
do you want me to say?

27:27.713 --> 27:29.913
That I hired my nephew to off
a United States congressman?!

27:35.754 --> 27:37.221
Lasalle:
Here's the deal.

27:37.223 --> 27:38.956
All you have
to do is prove

27:38.958 --> 27:40.891
You weren't in barataria
the other night.

27:40.893 --> 27:43.961
That, and tell me a three-letter
word for mistake.

27:43.963 --> 27:45.329
Three-letter word for what?

27:45.331 --> 27:47.231
Where were you, abe?

27:47.233 --> 27:49.333
Or should the two of us
get intimate again?

27:52.270 --> 27:54.271
Look...

27:54.273 --> 27:57.107
I was getting
a tattoo... Okay?

27:57.109 --> 27:58.108
Where?

27:58.110 --> 27:59.376
At a parlor
off carondelet.

27:59.378 --> 28:01.345
I was freakin' trashed.

28:01.347 --> 28:03.247
Seemed like
a good idea at the time.

28:03.249 --> 28:05.315
Why didn't you
tell us before?
Because...

28:07.152 --> 28:08.786
I was with someone.

28:08.788 --> 28:10.988
Who?

28:10.990 --> 28:12.890
I'm married.

28:12.892 --> 28:15.459
Too bad for your wife.

28:15.461 --> 28:17.961
I let the hooker
pick the artwork.

28:19.764 --> 28:21.165
Show us.

28:29.074 --> 28:30.307
Is that a rainbow?

28:30.309 --> 28:34.445
It's a double rainbow...
With a pot of gold.

28:34.447 --> 28:37.181
You want to see my leprechaun?

28:38.249 --> 28:40.818
No. No, we're good.

28:40.820 --> 28:43.253
Speakman made threats.

28:43.255 --> 28:45.089
The petty officer had motive.

28:45.091 --> 28:47.458
Too bad they both alibi'd out.

28:50.328 --> 28:51.328
(elevator stops)

28:51.330 --> 28:53.397
You stole that
move from me.

28:53.399 --> 28:55.833
I used to be the one
who stopped elevators.

28:55.835 --> 28:57.735
Stole, my ass.
I'm honored.

28:57.737 --> 28:59.770
What are we gonna
talk about?

28:59.772 --> 29:00.938
Privileged.

29:00.940 --> 29:02.506
Not you, too.

29:02.508 --> 29:05.209
Lorta's dead.
We caught the s.O.B.

29:05.211 --> 29:06.844
It's not a
coincidence.

29:06.846 --> 29:09.513
This was mac's case.
You saw how his throat was slit.

29:09.515 --> 29:12.249
You're forgetting
about the stab wounds.

29:12.251 --> 29:14.017
We didn't see any stab wounds.

29:14.019 --> 29:16.253
We didn't have a chance to look.

29:20.291 --> 29:21.759
(elevator starts)

29:21.761 --> 29:24.027
Thought we
were going up.

29:24.029 --> 29:26.163
Not anymore.

29:29.100 --> 29:31.401
There actually are
two small stab wounds

29:31.403 --> 29:33.270
To dan mclane's abdomen.

29:33.272 --> 29:35.439
Stab wounds couldn't
have been reported because

29:35.441 --> 29:38.041
I hadn't examined the body
before he was snatched away.

29:38.043 --> 29:40.244
Yeah, well, the similarities
to privileged are uncanny.

29:40.246 --> 29:43.313
I remember
the implicit details.

29:43.315 --> 29:45.415
Two wounds to the
midsection followed by

29:45.417 --> 29:47.384
A ripper-like throat-slashing.

29:47.386 --> 29:50.187
Lorta was a creature of habit.

29:50.189 --> 29:51.522
Got around, too.

29:51.524 --> 29:53.991
Cases spread from
massachusetts to florida.

29:53.993 --> 29:55.893
Yeah, books have been written,
classes taught.

29:55.895 --> 29:59.163
Former agent mclane was

29:59.165 --> 30:02.299
The lead investigator on
every publicly connected case.

30:02.301 --> 30:04.468
People associated him
with privileged.

30:04.470 --> 30:06.570
Ducky:
Which begs the question.

30:06.572 --> 30:08.405
Was the congressman used

30:08.407 --> 30:11.875
To pay tribute
to the memory of lorta?

30:13.077 --> 30:15.145
Copycat.

30:15.147 --> 30:18.482
Ah, no wonder the fbi wants
to keep this under wraps.

30:18.484 --> 30:21.485
There might be a killer
on the loose.

30:21.487 --> 30:22.920
(line ringing)

30:24.422 --> 30:27.457
Tobias... We got a problem.

30:30.428 --> 30:32.296
Brody:
Thanks for dinner.

30:32.298 --> 30:34.164
Lasalle: Where'd you learn
to question like that?

30:34.166 --> 30:35.532
(chuckles)
my parents' house.

30:35.534 --> 30:37.968
My folks like
to hear themselves talk.

30:37.970 --> 30:40.204
My dad's a professor
and my mom's a journalist,

30:40.206 --> 30:42.406
So my tolerance for b.S.
Is significant.

30:42.408 --> 30:44.474
That was a nice
face-plant, too.

30:44.476 --> 30:47.845
Girl's got to have some fun.

30:47.847 --> 30:49.546
Beautiful city.

30:49.548 --> 30:51.582
Not a place like it
in the world.

30:51.584 --> 30:55.385
Came here from alabama
when I was a teenager.

30:55.387 --> 30:57.120
Mardi gras parade
come through here?

30:57.122 --> 31:00.390
This is the exact spot
where I met dwayne pride.

31:00.392 --> 31:02.893
He was struttin' around,
dancing and singing.

31:02.895 --> 31:05.362
"how you doing,
my brother?"

31:05.364 --> 31:07.965
Who knew king would
save my life one day?

31:09.901 --> 31:12.402
Why you call him king?

31:12.404 --> 31:16.073
When he first opened up the nola
office, he made a drug bust,

31:16.075 --> 31:17.507
Cleaned up
a whole neighborhood.

31:17.509 --> 31:19.576
And he loves this city
like family.

31:19.578 --> 31:21.578
Local krewe made him
an honorary member.

31:21.580 --> 31:23.413
That never happens.

31:23.415 --> 31:26.149
Friends nicknamed
him king.

31:26.151 --> 31:28.518
Other than
his daughter being born,

31:28.520 --> 31:30.487
That's the proudest day
of his life.

31:30.489 --> 31:32.456
You really care about him.

31:32.458 --> 31:35.492
Yeah, I used to be
a sheriff's deputy.

31:35.494 --> 31:38.395
And after katrina, well,

31:38.397 --> 31:41.231
If it wasn't for king,
I wouldn't be here.

31:41.233 --> 31:42.499
No way.

31:42.501 --> 31:44.468
What about you?

31:44.470 --> 31:46.536
I mean,
why are you here?

31:46.538 --> 31:49.306
Needed a change.

31:49.308 --> 31:51.341
Guess... Some cities
make it easier

31:51.343 --> 31:53.577
To forget where you come from.

31:53.579 --> 31:57.681
Well, new orleans
doesn't forget-- it forgives.

31:58.650 --> 32:00.317
Hmm.

32:02.520 --> 32:05.923
♪

32:05.925 --> 32:08.358
Night now.
Y'all be safe.

32:08.360 --> 32:09.593
Night, agent doyle.

32:18.069 --> 32:19.136
(car alarm chirps)

32:25.243 --> 32:26.677
(engine starts)

32:28.246 --> 32:30.614
(muffled grunting)

32:47.966 --> 32:49.433
Yes, sir. I understand.

32:49.435 --> 32:51.668
I'll tell director vance.

32:51.670 --> 32:53.270
Is the rumor confirmed?

32:53.272 --> 32:56.273
Senior agent doyle
was found dead

32:56.275 --> 32:58.208
In her car this morning.

32:58.210 --> 33:00.377
Two puncture wounds
to her abdomen

33:00.379 --> 33:02.612
And her throat was cut--
same m.O.

33:02.614 --> 33:04.448
All right,
no more jurisdictional nonsense.

33:04.450 --> 33:06.316
We got a multiple on our hands.

33:06.318 --> 33:07.751
Why doyle?

33:07.753 --> 33:10.320
Fits the profile.
Public servant.

33:10.322 --> 33:12.389
She knew too much
or she got too close.

33:12.391 --> 33:14.391
Fbi didn't do us any favors.

33:14.393 --> 33:16.393
Doyle was
following orders.

33:16.395 --> 33:18.061
She did what she thought
was right.

33:18.063 --> 33:22.699
By controlling the distribution
of sensitive data.

33:22.701 --> 33:25.369
A congressman
was murdered here, pride.

33:25.371 --> 33:27.404
This case is a powder keg.

33:27.406 --> 33:29.139
The bureau thought
they could keep a lid on it.

33:29.141 --> 33:30.340
Didn't work out that way,
did it?

33:30.342 --> 33:33.410
All right, gentlemen,
kiss and make up.

33:33.412 --> 33:35.345
I don't care if
this is a copycat

33:35.347 --> 33:40.283
Work together cohesively
and figure out who did this.

33:40.285 --> 33:41.718
Because if one more agent dies,

33:41.720 --> 33:43.754
It's nobody else's fault
but our own.

33:43.756 --> 33:45.789
Gibbs:
Leon, murders seem to be

33:45.791 --> 33:47.224
Focused in new orleans.

33:47.226 --> 33:48.258
Permission to go back

33:48.260 --> 33:51.061
Down there
with agent pride?

33:52.263 --> 33:53.764
Take somebody with you.

33:53.766 --> 33:55.699
I need mcgee and dinozzo here.

33:55.701 --> 33:58.335
They've already started working
on the capitol hill angle.

33:58.337 --> 33:59.736
That could lead
to something.

33:59.738 --> 34:01.171
Bishop.

34:01.173 --> 34:04.241
Watch your six, both of you.

34:05.276 --> 34:07.611
<i>Laissez les bons temps rouler.</i>

34:07.613 --> 34:09.613
Let the good times roll.

34:09.615 --> 34:12.783
(upbeat jazz music playing)

34:27.432 --> 34:29.433
This happen every day?

34:29.435 --> 34:34.204
We celebrate it coming in,
celebrate it going out.

34:34.206 --> 34:36.173
What don't you celebrate?

34:36.175 --> 34:38.775
Not much.

34:38.777 --> 34:43.246
How come you're not on a base
or in a federal building?

34:43.248 --> 34:46.583
Do I look like the federal
building type to you?

34:50.555 --> 34:52.456
(keypad beeping)

34:52.458 --> 34:54.191
Bishop.

34:55.126 --> 34:56.726
Come on.

34:56.728 --> 34:59.096
You have
a junk food machine inside?

34:59.098 --> 35:01.164
All right.

35:04.569 --> 35:08.138
(imitating ricky ricardo):
Lucy, I'm ho...

35:09.307 --> 35:11.308
Welcome back, king.

35:14.445 --> 35:15.846
Place looks...

35:15.848 --> 35:18.715
(grunts)

35:18.717 --> 35:19.850
...Neater.

35:19.852 --> 35:22.419
We just put
some things away.

35:22.421 --> 35:24.387
Don't clean up too much.

35:24.389 --> 35:26.456
I won't be able to...

35:26.458 --> 35:27.858
Find a damn thing.

35:27.860 --> 35:30.460
Organized chaos. I get it.

35:33.431 --> 35:35.198
You're the interrogator?

35:35.200 --> 35:37.167
Yes, sir. And I think
we're onto something.

35:37.169 --> 35:38.768
You hear that, gi...

35:38.770 --> 35:40.537
Gibbs?

35:40.539 --> 35:43.273
You hear this?
She found something.

35:44.842 --> 35:47.177
Hello, special agent gibbs.

35:47.179 --> 35:49.146
Hello, brody. Been a while.

35:51.682 --> 35:53.250
You two know
each other?

35:53.252 --> 35:54.518
Can't talk about it.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.520
Personal?
Classified.

35:56.522 --> 35:57.854
Perfect.

35:57.856 --> 36:00.323
Since the m.O. Is all
we had to go on, I did

36:00.325 --> 36:01.491
A search through the local
cold case database.

36:01.493 --> 36:02.859
Lasalle:
Recent unsolved homicides

36:02.861 --> 36:05.495
Through five states
across the panhandle.

36:05.497 --> 36:06.463
2001,

36:06.465 --> 36:08.565
Marine sergeant louise tibbs,

36:08.567 --> 36:09.900
Two stabs to the abdomen

36:09.902 --> 36:11.902
And her throat
was cut.

36:11.904 --> 36:14.571
2004, martin helm,
a navy reservist in alabama,

36:14.573 --> 36:16.239
Two stabs
to the abdomen

36:16.241 --> 36:17.841
And his throat
was cut.

36:17.843 --> 36:21.178
The copycat-- he just didn't
start doing this now.

36:21.180 --> 36:22.712
He's been at it
for a while;

36:22.714 --> 36:23.914
The cases
just didn't connect.

36:23.916 --> 36:25.182
Can you send me everything?

36:25.184 --> 36:26.917
Forensics, police reports,

36:26.919 --> 36:28.652
All of it.

36:28.654 --> 36:29.953
Where can I sit?

36:29.955 --> 36:31.454
Is the... Floor clean?

36:31.456 --> 36:32.455
Here.

36:32.457 --> 36:33.790
Do you have any sugar?

36:33.792 --> 36:35.425
Lots of it?

36:35.427 --> 36:36.493
Err.

36:36.495 --> 36:38.195
Huh?

36:38.197 --> 36:39.663
Three-letter word for mistake.
"err."

36:40.932 --> 36:42.499
Where's the crime scene
where doyle was killed?

36:42.501 --> 36:44.501
Let's ride.

36:46.938 --> 36:49.206
Go.

36:59.550 --> 37:01.818
(elevator bell dings)

37:01.820 --> 37:03.520
T-m-f.

37:03.522 --> 37:04.588
Yay.

37:04.590 --> 37:06.656
Too many federal agents?

37:06.658 --> 37:08.658
Tony, mcgee, fornell.
It's kind of weird

37:08.660 --> 37:11.528
Having you all down here at the
same time, but I really like it.

37:11.530 --> 37:13.530
Abby, was there anything
on the floor mats

37:13.532 --> 37:15.465
From agent doyle's car?

37:15.467 --> 37:19.636
Okay, getting me the mats
from doyle's car was genius.

37:19.638 --> 37:21.671
'cause if the killer was in
the backseat, so were his shoes.

37:21.673 --> 37:25.609
And these days, forensic details
often come from the sole.

37:26.544 --> 37:28.678
The s-o-l-e.

37:28.680 --> 37:29.879
(chuckles)

37:29.881 --> 37:31.815
Why are we spelling
everything?

37:31.817 --> 37:35.518
Um, okay, so I ran the breakdown
through major mass spec,

37:35.520 --> 37:37.254
And he came
back with...

37:37.256 --> 37:40.023
Minute traces
of high-octane fuel,

37:40.025 --> 37:43.793
Fried food, italian
marble dust, caramel corn

37:43.795 --> 37:46.529
With a hint of pigeon poop.

37:46.531 --> 37:49.532
Where the hell was this guy?

37:50.568 --> 37:52.502
What's she doing
down there?

37:52.504 --> 37:55.438
Bishop thing.
Perspective.

37:55.440 --> 37:56.773
Pride: Then why is
brody doing it?

37:56.775 --> 37:57.974
(cell phone ringing)

37:57.976 --> 37:59.609
Maybe it's a
woman thing.

37:59.611 --> 38:01.645
Yeah, abbs.
I'm here.

38:04.749 --> 38:07.350
Chris, I'm sorry
about doyle.

38:07.352 --> 38:08.885
I know she was a friend.

38:08.887 --> 38:11.488
Yes, sir.

38:11.490 --> 38:13.523
She was a good girl.

38:14.692 --> 38:16.526
She helpful?

38:16.528 --> 38:18.561
Lasalle: Walked into this
and didn't even blink.

38:18.563 --> 38:21.331
Didn't ask if she was tough,
asked if she was helpful.

38:21.333 --> 38:22.699
100%.

38:22.701 --> 38:23.967
Brody:
Hey, why does everything

38:23.969 --> 38:25.535
In this part of town
smell like beer?

38:25.537 --> 38:27.537
Probably 'cause
you're standing in a...

38:27.539 --> 38:29.339
Puddle of bachelor party vomit.

38:29.341 --> 38:30.707
Nice.

38:30.709 --> 38:32.475
So, based on the location

38:32.477 --> 38:34.711
Of the streetlamps and the
amount of pedestrian traffic,

38:34.713 --> 38:36.713
I'm surprised none of the
residents saw the killer.

38:36.715 --> 38:39.549
Somebody in one of these
apartments must have seen doyle

38:39.551 --> 38:41.518
From their window--
I'd bet on it.

38:41.520 --> 38:42.686
She's right.

38:42.688 --> 38:44.888
Pd probably already
knocked on doors.

38:44.890 --> 38:46.690
Do it again.
Leave business cards.

38:46.692 --> 38:48.591
All right. Okay.

38:48.593 --> 38:50.760
Brody, can I have a minute?

38:50.762 --> 38:52.729
Yeah.

38:52.731 --> 38:53.997
That's good work.

38:53.999 --> 38:55.565
Thanks.

38:55.567 --> 38:57.567
I made some calls.

38:57.569 --> 39:00.003
You volunteered
for this assignment, right?

39:01.605 --> 39:05.442
See, lasalle
and me, we...

39:05.444 --> 39:08.445
We got a good thing
going down here.

39:08.447 --> 39:10.080
Lot of trust.

39:10.082 --> 39:12.782
So I got to ask...

39:12.784 --> 39:14.784
You running from something?

39:14.786 --> 39:16.753
Gibbs:
Okay.

39:16.755 --> 39:18.388
That was abby.

39:18.390 --> 39:21.091
Popcorn, junk food...

39:21.093 --> 39:23.760
Pigeon crap.

39:23.762 --> 39:24.828
What do you got?

39:33.671 --> 39:35.839
This what you
looking for, gibbs?

39:38.743 --> 39:40.143
Yeah. Maybe.

39:40.145 --> 39:42.679
This is where he decides
who to target next?

39:42.681 --> 39:44.114
It's like he's shopping.

39:53.791 --> 39:55.859
Got plenty of
vantage points.

40:00.798 --> 40:02.632
He wanted us
to come here.

40:02.634 --> 40:05.602
Son of a bitch knew
we'd check the back of the car.

40:05.604 --> 40:09.973
Left a trail for us to follow
so he could see us, identify us.

40:09.975 --> 40:11.608
Yeah, he's watching.

40:11.610 --> 40:13.143
We're his pigeons.

40:13.145 --> 40:15.412
Or his sitting ducks.

40:16.714 --> 40:19.015
Take your pick.
