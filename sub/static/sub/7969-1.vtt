01:51.611 --> 01:55.679
Narrator: Once upon a time,
long before man learned to fly,

01:55.681 --> 02:00.116
long before locomotives left
smoky streamers on the horizon,

02:00.118 --> 02:01.817
long before all this,

02:01.819 --> 02:04.553
somewhere farther
than man could sail,

02:04.555 --> 02:06.521
there was a little valley.

02:06.523 --> 02:08.856
There on the banks
of the winding stream

02:08.858 --> 02:11.258
nestled a peaceful
little village,

02:11.260 --> 02:14.227
and draped around this Hamlet,
stretching far and wide

02:14.229 --> 02:16.529
over hill and Dale,

02:16.531 --> 02:18.730
was the great forest.

02:21.901 --> 02:26.436
Here, deep among old trees,
wet moss, and velvet shadows,

02:26.438 --> 02:29.138
life flows peacefully along.

02:29.140 --> 02:30.272
Or does it?

02:32.809 --> 02:34.775
Woman:
Jonathan?

02:41.617 --> 02:42.749
Funny.

02:43.585 --> 02:45.685
[Clattering]

02:45.687 --> 02:47.753
Who's playing games?

03:01.734 --> 03:02.899
Look here, young woman!

03:02.901 --> 03:05.268
I might have cut you in half.

03:05.270 --> 03:06.902
No axe can harm me, Jonathan.

03:06.904 --> 03:09.604
Honest Jonathan...
that is your name, isn't it?

03:09.606 --> 03:12.340
Honest by name,
honest by nature.

03:12.342 --> 03:14.942
Young woman, kindly step aside.
I've business with that tree.

03:14.944 --> 03:17.244
And so have I.

03:17.246 --> 03:19.246
I've come to ask you
not to cut it down.

03:19.248 --> 03:21.481
Oh, fancy now, have you?

03:21.483 --> 03:24.217
And may I ask what you
have to do with it?

03:24.219 --> 03:26.819
You see, I am queen
of this forest.

03:26.821 --> 03:30.789
Oh! And I'm
the emperor of China.

03:33.593 --> 03:35.459
Very well, then.

03:35.461 --> 03:38.795
Let me put it in this way.

03:38.797 --> 03:40.930
You see...

03:40.932 --> 03:43.832
This tree is the oldest
and fairest of them all.

03:43.834 --> 03:45.700
It's a mighty big
oak tree that will keep

03:45.702 --> 03:48.569
the whole village warm
right through the winter.

03:48.571 --> 03:51.338
But who is going to
keep them warm all winter...

03:51.340 --> 03:53.473
the little creatures
that live in its branches?

03:54.676 --> 03:56.809
See how frightened they are?

03:56.811 --> 03:59.545
Well, look here,
it's all very well...

03:59.547 --> 04:02.214
spare this tree, Jonathan,
and they'll bless you,

04:02.216 --> 04:04.216
and so shall I.

04:05.719 --> 04:08.853
Of course, if you
put it like that...

04:13.225 --> 04:13.990
Alright.

04:13.992 --> 04:16.359
Oh, thank you, Jonathan.

04:16.361 --> 04:18.661
You shall not go unrewarded.

04:19.864 --> 04:21.763
I'll grant you three wishes.

04:22.866 --> 04:24.665
What?

04:24.667 --> 04:27.934
Anything I wish for?
Three times?

04:27.936 --> 04:29.735
Of course.

04:30.904 --> 04:33.471
Bah! I ought to have
more sense.

04:33.473 --> 04:35.372
First, I give away
the finest tree,

04:35.374 --> 04:37.874
and then I start talking
about three wishes.

04:37.876 --> 04:40.476
Fairy tales, all.
Fairy tales!

04:49.786 --> 04:51.452
Where are you?

04:52.955 --> 04:54.754
Where have you gone?

04:57.558 --> 04:58.757
Jonathan.

05:04.263 --> 05:07.597
The wishes belong
to both you and your wife.

05:07.599 --> 05:08.965
Don't be hasty.

05:08.967 --> 05:10.266
Yes, your majesty.

05:10.268 --> 05:12.301
Oh, I mean, no, your majesty.

05:12.303 --> 05:15.337
I... I beg your majesty's
pardon, I'm sure.

05:15.339 --> 05:16.771
You may stand up now.

05:16.773 --> 05:21.408
Oh, thank you, your majesty.

05:21.410 --> 05:24.544
I'm afraid the tree
got a little bit chipped,

05:24.546 --> 05:26.445
but don't worry, your majesty.

05:26.447 --> 05:28.947
It will soon heal over.

05:28.949 --> 05:30.481
Real soon.

05:53.572 --> 05:57.006
Sally! Sally!
Barnabee! Sally!

05:59.010 --> 06:00.309
[Braying]

06:07.684 --> 06:12.753
Anna! Anna. Anna.
Do you know what happened today?

06:12.755 --> 06:14.321
Good evening, Jonathan.
Good evening.

06:14.323 --> 06:15.588
You'll never believe
what happened to me!

06:15.590 --> 06:16.722
Not now. Dinner's all ready.

06:16.724 --> 06:18.590
Hurry and get cleaned up.

06:18.592 --> 06:21.693
Alright, Anna. But just
listen to me for a minute.

06:21.695 --> 06:24.996
You know those oak trees
along by the post road

06:24.998 --> 06:26.964
with the great big one
in the middle?

06:26.966 --> 06:30.467
I was working there today,
when suddenly...

06:30.469 --> 06:32.001
I saw a vision.

06:32.003 --> 06:33.635
Yes, I know.

06:33.637 --> 06:34.836
You don't believe me,
do you, Anna?

06:34.838 --> 06:37.471
Sit down and say grace.

06:42.678 --> 06:44.778
For what we're about to receive,
truly thankful. Amen.

06:44.780 --> 06:46.346
Now then, Anna,
let me tell you.

06:46.348 --> 06:47.980
I was chopping away
at that big oak tree,

06:47.982 --> 06:49.982
the one I was telling you about,
when all of a sudden,

06:49.984 --> 06:52.984
there was the most
wonderful smell of roses.

06:54.654 --> 06:55.819
[Sniff]

06:55.821 --> 06:58.755
Cabbage.
Always cabbage.

06:58.757 --> 06:59.856
Can't we ever
eat anything else?

06:59.858 --> 07:01.757
We can't afford anything else.

07:01.759 --> 07:03.825
You should thank the good lord
for what he provides.

07:03.827 --> 07:05.459
But just for once,
I wish he'd provide

07:05.461 --> 07:07.461
a nice, big, juicy sausage.

07:09.031 --> 07:11.531
It's here! Where did it
come from?

07:11.533 --> 07:13.766
I told you. It's what I've been
trying to tell you all the time.

07:13.768 --> 07:16.068
She granted us three wishes!

07:16.070 --> 07:18.970
She?
Who is she?

07:18.972 --> 07:21.806
Why, the vision, of course.
The beautiful lady.

07:21.808 --> 07:23.707
What beautiful lady?

07:23.709 --> 07:25.875
You never saw anything
like it in your life.

07:25.877 --> 07:27.509
One minute, she wasn't there,

07:27.511 --> 07:28.877
and the next minute,
there she was.

07:28.879 --> 07:31.079
Her skin was like
mother-of-pearl,

07:31.081 --> 07:33.981
her hair was like
the gold of wild honey,

07:33.983 --> 07:35.482
and she was so young...

07:35.484 --> 07:37.050
Oh, shame on you, an old man
talking like that.

07:37.052 --> 07:38.818
So lovely!

07:38.820 --> 07:41.260
That sausage should grow on your
nose for saying such a thing!

07:43.056 --> 07:44.989
The sausage!

07:44.991 --> 07:46.690
See what you've done?

07:46.692 --> 07:48.958
She's granted our second wish!

07:48.960 --> 07:51.026
Now two of our wishes
are wasted.

07:51.028 --> 07:53.395
I know what to do.

07:53.397 --> 07:54.629
We'll simply cut it off.

07:54.631 --> 07:56.797
No, you don't!

07:56.799 --> 07:59.633
Alright, then, let it stay.

07:59.635 --> 08:01.568
It doesn't look so bad.

08:01.570 --> 08:02.902
Maybe you don't mind me

08:02.904 --> 08:05.771
walking around
like this, but I do.

08:05.773 --> 08:09.641
And I wish this thing was
off my nose this very instant.

08:14.447 --> 08:17.181
You ought to be ashamed,
throwing away our last wish.

08:17.183 --> 08:19.950
What difference does it make
to a nose as big as yours?

08:19.952 --> 08:21.952
Mine doesn't smell
like garlic all the time.

08:21.954 --> 08:23.053
So...

08:23.055 --> 08:24.921
You're tired of sausage
already?

08:24.923 --> 08:26.422
First you're tired of cabbage.

08:26.424 --> 08:28.457
Now you're tired of sausage.

08:28.459 --> 08:30.525
But, Anna, all I said was...

08:30.527 --> 08:31.959
you wished for it, didn't you?

08:31.961 --> 08:34.127
Once in a lifetime,
poor people like us

08:34.129 --> 08:35.962
can ask for anything they want,

08:35.964 --> 08:37.596
and what do you wish for?

08:37.598 --> 08:38.897
A sausage!

08:38.899 --> 08:40.598
We had three
perfectly good wishes

08:40.600 --> 08:43.000
and what have we to show
for them? Tell me, what?

08:43.002 --> 08:45.035
Nothing. That is what we have.

08:45.037 --> 08:47.170
When we could have had
anything we wanted.

08:47.172 --> 08:50.473
Oh, when I think of it,
I could cry.

08:50.475 --> 08:52.741
Cabbage wasn't
good enough for you.

08:52.743 --> 08:54.476
Of all the things we need,

08:54.478 --> 08:57.812
you wish for a sausage.
You and your silly wishes!

08:57.814 --> 08:59.914
I sometimes wonder
why I ever...

09:31.146 --> 09:35.081
Jonathan... I'm sorry.

09:35.083 --> 09:37.216
Please forgive me.

09:37.218 --> 09:40.886
Ah, it's alright, Anna.
Let's forget it.

09:58.038 --> 09:59.937
Jonathan:
You know, Anna,

09:59.939 --> 10:02.739
a toy without a child
is almost as sad

10:02.741 --> 10:04.907
as a child without a toy.

10:09.713 --> 10:12.947
Jonathan, we were so foolish.

10:12.949 --> 10:16.650
Our dream could have come true.

10:16.652 --> 10:18.985
There's still hope, Anna.

10:18.987 --> 10:22.121
She might grant us
another wish...

10:22.123 --> 10:24.957
just a little one, maybe.

10:24.959 --> 10:28.593
It wouldn't matter to me
how little he was.

10:28.595 --> 10:32.129
I'd love him with all my heart,

10:32.131 --> 10:35.900
even if he were
no bigger than my thumb.

Hmm?

11:36.847 --> 11:39.380
Someone's outside.
Don't you hear?

11:39.382 --> 11:40.414
What?

11:40.416 --> 11:42.015
Someone's knocking!

11:47.121 --> 11:49.354

Is this acorn cottage?
That's right.

the woodcutter?

12:53.011 --> 12:56.145
Yes, but I can't see you.

12:56.147 --> 12:57.846
Are you Jonathan?

12:57.848 --> 13:00.415
Yes, I am, but where are you?

13:00.417 --> 13:02.950
Then I'm in the right place.

but I can't see you.

Oh, thanks. I'm cold.

13:22.301 --> 13:25.168
Ahh, that feels good, father.

13:25.170 --> 13:26.469
Father?

13:26.471 --> 13:28.504
You called me father?

13:28.506 --> 13:32.274
Of course. Don't you
recognize your own son?

13:32.276 --> 13:36.544

I understand.

13:36.546 --> 13:40.014

as fast as I could

That's your mother, son.

13:57.163 --> 13:59.263
Come on in.
Surprise her.

14:05.304 --> 14:08.004
We have a visitor, Anna...

14:08.006 --> 14:10.306
a little visitor.

as long as we live.

my name, mother?

what your name would be.

on his birthday?

You must be starving.

36:16.852 --> 36:18.751
I still am,

36:18.753 --> 36:20.919
but I won't always be.

36:20.921 --> 36:24.288
One day, queenie,
I'll be worthy of you.

36:27.259 --> 36:28.791
And until then...

36:30.895 --> 36:32.794
I'll respect you.

36:36.299 --> 36:37.798
Thank you, Woody.

36:41.436 --> 36:42.802
That's nice.

[Playing pipe]

36:55.515 --> 36:56.847
Hello, Woody.

37:00.586 --> 37:02.319
Good afternoon, Jonathan.

37:03.889 --> 37:06.289
Meet my son tom.

37:07.558 --> 37:10.258
Pleased to meet you, young man.

37:10.260 --> 37:11.425
Goodbye now.

37:11.427 --> 37:12.759
Jonathan:
What's the hurry, Woody?

37:12.761 --> 37:14.927
Why don't you come home
and have supper with us?

37:14.929 --> 37:17.496
You know Anna's always happy
to see you.

37:17.498 --> 37:19.898
Thanks, Jonathan. I wish
I could, but I can't.

37:19.900 --> 37:21.766
I'm a very busy man now.

37:21.768 --> 37:25.236
I have to get back
to the village. I have a job.

37:25.238 --> 37:27.972
You? Working?
Certainly.

37:27.974 --> 37:30.541
So long. I'll see you
at the fair on Sunday?

37:30.543 --> 37:32.476
Oh, I don't think you will.

37:32.478 --> 37:35.545
Anna and I... we're too old
for things like that.

37:35.547 --> 37:38.214
Oh, Jonathan, how can you
let this fella

37:38.216 --> 37:39.615
miss seeing the fair?

37:39.617 --> 37:42.284
Look, if you can't take him,
let him go with me.

37:44.588 --> 37:46.688
I'll show him a good time.

37:46.690 --> 37:48.623
He'll be the guest
of the second woodwind

37:48.625 --> 37:51.459
in the royal military band.

37:51.461 --> 37:52.526

41:27.515 --> 41:28.480
Huh?

41:28.482 --> 41:30.949
The dancing shoes.

41:30.951 --> 41:32.617
Oh, I think they're wonderful.

41:32.619 --> 41:34.719
I think so, too.
Let's get some.

41:34.721 --> 41:36.020
But don't you
have to stay here?

41:36.022 --> 41:39.523
Oh, we'll be back before
it's my turn to play.

for a few minutes.

Hold on, tom.
Let's go.

I'm sorry, Woody.

42:19.028 --> 42:21.128
All sold out.

42:21.130 --> 42:23.096
Not even a pair for a queen?

Oh, very funny, Woody.
Ha ha ha! Very funny.

42:27.602 --> 42:29.935
Well, how about a pair
for this little fellow?

42:29.937 --> 42:33.471
For tom? You know,
I believe I have.

42:38.177 --> 42:40.577

Where is he?
Where's Woody?

45:04.806 --> 45:08.174
I was crazy to give him a job
in the first place.

45:08.176 --> 45:09.975
Woody!

45:09.977 --> 45:12.243
Woody, wherever you are...

You're fired!

45:25.122 --> 45:26.821
Better go after him, Woody.

45:26.823 --> 45:28.455
Those are talented shoes
he's wearing.

45:28.457 --> 45:32.258
They'll keep on dancing
as long as the music plays.

Tom!

46:21.101 --> 46:22.100
Have you seen tom?

46:22.102 --> 46:23.934
No, I haven't.

46:26.405 --> 46:27.537

No.

Hey, Woody!
Look at me!

46:52.125 --> 46:54.058
Don't let go, tom!

46:56.162 --> 46:58.328
Hang on!

47:07.171 --> 47:09.070
It's no good, Ivan.

47:09.072 --> 47:11.338
It won't give at all.

47:11.340 --> 47:12.572
Now...

47:12.574 --> 47:14.240
Finding ourselves
in the situation

47:14.242 --> 47:16.008
in which you have placed us,

47:16.010 --> 47:18.543
it would seem a little
coordination is necessary.

47:18.545 --> 47:21.145
We'll use this piece of wood.

47:21.147 --> 47:24.281
This time, our effort
shall be unified.

47:24.283 --> 47:26.950
Now, both together
when I count 3.

47:26.952 --> 47:28.451
You understand 3?

47:28.453 --> 47:31.053
Yes. It comes after 2.

47:31.055 --> 47:33.889
Good boy. Right.

47:33.891 --> 47:35.590
1, 2...

[Crash]

47:59.579 --> 48:02.179
Hey, Ivan.
Shh.

48:08.420 --> 48:10.319
Now, we must approach
this problem

48:10.321 --> 48:13.055
from a highly scientific angle.

48:13.057 --> 48:14.589
Sure, but...

48:14.591 --> 48:19.226
but first, we must practice
unadulterated silence.

48:19.228 --> 48:20.994
Understand?

48:30.571 --> 48:31.903
[Creaking]

48:31.905 --> 48:33.037
Tom:
Hey! What are you doing?

48:33.039 --> 48:34.538
It's the little runt!

48:34.540 --> 48:36.439
Yes.

48:37.442 --> 48:39.308
Ivan:
Yes, yes.

49:01.230 --> 49:03.663
Thank you.
You saved my life.

49:03.665 --> 49:05.531
Think nothing of it,
young fellow.

49:05.533 --> 49:08.567
Fate decreed I should be present
in your hour of need,

49:08.569 --> 49:10.101
that is all.

49:10.103 --> 49:12.369
Ivan, why can't we
use him to get...

49:12.371 --> 49:13.603
why don't you shut up?

49:13.605 --> 49:16.105
Oh...

49:16.107 --> 49:17.339
Young fellow,

49:17.341 --> 49:19.274
talking about hour of need,

49:19.276 --> 49:25.012
it would seem you dropped in
just when my companion and I

49:25.014 --> 49:27.981
could use your assistance in
the performance of a good deed.

49:27.983 --> 49:30.149
Oh, I'll be glad to help.

49:30.151 --> 49:31.517
I knew it.

49:31.519 --> 49:34.319
I knew it the first time
I laid eyes on him, see.

49:34.321 --> 49:36.587
That's what I like about this
charming young gentleman.

49:36.589 --> 49:38.488
He's so cooperative.

49:38.490 --> 49:40.389
Uh, what do I have to do?

49:40.391 --> 49:42.357
Come over here.

49:43.126 --> 49:45.359
Get the rope.

49:52.167 --> 49:54.667
Now, Thomas, my boy,
listen to me.

49:54.669 --> 49:57.102
Let me explain.

49:57.104 --> 49:59.003
Now, the mayor of this village

49:59.005 --> 50:01.505
is an absolute rascal, right?

50:01.507 --> 50:03.106
Now, he has the money

50:03.108 --> 50:05.675
belonging to the poor
orphans down there.

50:05.677 --> 50:08.144
And he intends to keep it
all for himself.

50:08.146 --> 50:11.313
Now, if you'll go
down this rope

50:11.315 --> 50:13.181
and help us
to get the money out,

50:13.183 --> 50:15.383
we'll see
that it is distributed

50:15.385 --> 50:18.419
amongst those to whom
it rightfully belongs, eh?

50:18.421 --> 50:21.522
I don't know. Maybe I should ask
my father or Woody.

50:21.524 --> 50:24.958
Oh, no! No, there's no necessity
to bother them.

50:24.960 --> 50:27.260
I'm sure they would approve.
In fact, I'm quite certain

50:27.262 --> 50:29.695
your father would be
very proud of you.

50:29.697 --> 50:32.030
Very proud.
Why, yes.

50:32.032 --> 50:33.598
He would?

50:33.600 --> 50:36.167
Yes, of course he would.
Come on. Let's pull the job...

50:36.169 --> 50:41.137
I mean, let us do our best
to help the poor little orphans.

50:41.139 --> 50:42.204
Shall we?

50:52.715 --> 50:54.214
You see, Antony?

50:54.216 --> 50:56.416
Everything comes
to him who waits.

50:56.418 --> 50:59.252
He believed every word
of that silly story. Ha ha!

50:59.254 --> 51:01.053
Hey, wait a minute!

51:01.055 --> 51:03.422
How do I know that money's
really for the poor orphans?

51:03.424 --> 51:05.424
Oh, uh...

51:05.426 --> 51:08.460
Well, you have
my word of honor.

51:08.462 --> 51:11.029
And you have mine.

51:11.031 --> 51:13.631
Oh! Oh, well,
then it must be alright.

51:16.102 --> 51:17.468
Whew.

51:44.562 --> 51:45.594
What should I do now?

51:45.596 --> 51:47.596
Shh.

51:47.598 --> 51:50.365
Tie the rope to one
of those bags.

51:50.367 --> 51:52.333
Uh, which one?

51:52.335 --> 51:53.500
The biggest one!

51:53.502 --> 51:54.801
Shh.

51:56.704 --> 51:58.537
Then climb on,
and we'll pull you up.

52:10.216 --> 52:12.749
It's going to work,
Tony. Ha ha!

52:12.751 --> 52:15.184
Nobody will guess
how we did it.

52:18.589 --> 52:19.654
It's ready.

52:20.657 --> 52:22.189
Right, right.

52:41.476 --> 52:42.541
Ha ha ha!

52:42.543 --> 52:45.210
Ahh! Ha ha ha!

52:45.212 --> 52:46.811
[Trumpet fanfare]

53:07.766 --> 53:10.233
Tom: Aren't we going to
take any more?

53:10.835 --> 53:12.167
Shh.

53:12.169 --> 53:14.302
Not now. Maybe we'll
come back later.

53:16.572 --> 53:18.671
Well, there's plenty more
down there.

53:21.208 --> 53:22.307
Ivan.

53:24.110 --> 53:26.376
Let's get rid of the kid now

53:26.378 --> 53:29.312
so he won't open his mouth.

53:29.314 --> 53:31.380
Are you out of your mind?

53:31.382 --> 53:32.848
Leave this to me.

53:32.850 --> 53:36.384
Now, listen, my dear fellow.

53:36.386 --> 53:38.786
We're going to take you
for a nice little ride.

53:38.788 --> 53:40.454
Tony: Ivan.

53:40.456 --> 53:42.255
They are gone.

53:42.257 --> 53:43.856
Come on.

53:57.404 --> 54:00.171
Now, tom, this is where
we must part.

54:03.209 --> 54:05.209
Now, that's the road
that takes you home.

54:05.211 --> 54:07.778
Now, remember our little secret.
Don't tell anyone.

54:07.780 --> 54:09.646
That's the only way
we can surprise

54:09.648 --> 54:11.214
the dear little orphans.

54:11.216 --> 54:13.216
Oh, by the way,

54:13.218 --> 54:15.384
I'm sure
the dear little orphans

54:15.386 --> 54:17.519
would like you to have this.

54:17.521 --> 54:18.787
[Coin rolling]

54:18.789 --> 54:20.855
Run and get it!

54:27.829 --> 54:28.894
Tooty dooty doo!

54:29.796 --> 54:31.929
Tooty tooty too.

54:36.501 --> 54:37.733
Bye!

54:37.735 --> 54:39.434
Bye.

54:41.271 --> 54:42.770
Goodbye.

54:44.640 --> 54:45.772
Bye.

54:51.445 --> 54:53.344
[Screech]

54:53.346 --> 54:55.446
[Laughing]

55:05.924 --> 55:06.956
[Crack]

55:06.958 --> 55:09.458
[Animal shrieking]

55:19.703 --> 55:21.002
[Gulp]

55:27.410 --> 55:28.776
[Whistling]

55:35.551 --> 55:38.351
[Animal snarling]

55:38.353 --> 55:39.952
Help! Help!

55:49.796 --> 55:51.862
And where have you
been all day?

55:51.864 --> 55:53.830
Oh, all over the place.

55:53.832 --> 55:55.598
I had a wonderful time.

55:55.600 --> 55:56.932
I got some talented shoes,

55:56.934 --> 55:59.501
and then I went dancing,
and I rode on a balloon.

55:59.503 --> 56:02.370
Oh, I've just been helping
two friends do a good deed.

56:02.372 --> 56:04.905
Until it got dark,
and you fell into the swamp.

56:04.907 --> 56:06.840
Ah, I'd have got out anyway,

56:06.842 --> 56:08.074
but thanks just the same.

56:08.076 --> 56:10.009
[Rustling]

56:11.846 --> 56:13.645
What was that?

56:15.048 --> 56:17.981
Hi, queenie.
Hello, Woody.

56:21.686 --> 56:24.753
Do you realize I have searched
every inch of this forest

56:24.755 --> 56:26.087
trying to find you?

56:26.089 --> 56:28.122
Well, I'm sorry you got lost.

56:28.124 --> 56:29.923
<i>I</i> got lost?

56:29.925 --> 56:31.591
<i>You</i> got lost you mean.

56:31.593 --> 56:33.426
I've been looking
for you all day.

56:33.428 --> 56:34.693
The trouble with you, tom...

56:34.695 --> 56:36.728
oh, Woody, why don't
you leave him alone?

56:36.730 --> 56:38.930
Never mind, queenie.
The trouble with you, tom,

56:38.932 --> 56:40.865
is you have no sense
of responsibility.

56:40.867 --> 56:42.867
Responsibility?

56:42.869 --> 56:45.135
What about<i> your</i> sense
of responsibility?

56:45.137 --> 56:47.904
You were to keep your job
and take care of tom.

56:47.906 --> 56:49.939
He only went away
to get you a pair of shoes.

56:49.941 --> 56:51.073
You stay out of this!

56:51.075 --> 56:53.008
Don't speak to him like that.

56:53.010 --> 56:55.443
I think you'd better
take him straight home.

56:55.445 --> 56:58.579
Oh! "Do this, do that."
I've had enough!

56:58.581 --> 57:00.414
I'm tired of dragging
through this forest

57:00.416 --> 57:02.015
doing things for other people.

57:02.017 --> 57:03.983
If it's not him flying
around in balloons,

57:03.985 --> 57:06.085
it's you trying to
get me to kiss you.

57:06.087 --> 57:07.653
Woody! How dare you?

57:07.655 --> 57:10.589
Ah, yes, don't think
I don't know.

57:10.591 --> 57:12.123
I'm not as dumb as I may look.

57:12.125 --> 57:14.992
I will kiss you when I'm good
and ready to marry you

57:14.994 --> 57:16.393
and not before

57:16.395 --> 57:17.527
if you think I'd marry

57:17.529 --> 57:19.962
a no-good, idle
do-nothing like you,

57:19.964 --> 57:25.434
you second woodwind,
you! Oh!

57:28.906 --> 57:30.138
Hey, wh-wh-what...

57:30.974 --> 57:32.773
Don't go, queenie.

57:39.881 --> 57:43.014
I'm... I'm sorry, Woody.
It was all my fault.

57:44.884 --> 57:47.751
Oh, it's...
It's alright.

57:47.753 --> 57:50.019
Well, come on, tom.

57:50.021 --> 57:51.820
Let's get you home.

58:05.601 --> 58:07.701
That good-for-nothing
Woody.

58:07.703 --> 58:10.503
He'll have some
tall explaining to do.

58:14.041 --> 58:16.708
Your father's in
a pretty bad mood.

58:16.710 --> 58:19.677
Yes. You better
go ahead.

58:19.679 --> 58:22.713
I'll try to get to bed
before father sees me.

58:22.715 --> 58:26.616
You've had enough
trouble of your own.

58:26.618 --> 58:28.684
Thanks, tom.

58:28.686 --> 58:30.152
So long.

58:30.154 --> 58:31.653
Bye.

58:39.996 --> 58:41.795
Jonathan: Disgraceful!
Disgraceful!

58:41.797 --> 58:44.664
A boy of his age being out
till this time of night.

58:44.666 --> 58:46.999
It's been dark for hours.

58:47.001 --> 58:50.068
I should never have let them go.
It's my fault.

58:50.070 --> 58:51.668
Where are they?
Where are they?

58:54.906 --> 58:56.639
I'll teach him a lesson.

58:56.641 --> 58:58.874
I hope nothing's
happened to him.

58:58.876 --> 59:01.543
Something<i> will</i> happen to him
when he gets home.

59:03.747 --> 59:06.013
The idea of a youngster
like that

59:06.015 --> 59:07.981
gallivanting around.

59:07.983 --> 59:10.683
I'll see he doesn't do it again,
I can tell you that.

59:23.831 --> 59:24.863
[Crash]

59:24.865 --> 59:26.197
So...

59:26.199 --> 59:29.500
You finally decided
to come home.

59:30.102 --> 59:31.234
Now, you tell me

59:31.236 --> 59:32.768
what you've been
doing all this time,

59:32.770 --> 59:34.503
and it better be good.

59:34.505 --> 59:37.138
Jonathan, you mustn't allow
yourself to get upset like this.

59:37.140 --> 59:39.240
We'll talk about it
in the morning.

59:41.811 --> 59:43.944
Say goodnight to your father.

59:45.814 --> 59:48.214
Goodnight, father.
I'm sorry.

1:00:02.163 --> 1:00:03.962
Trouble, yes?

1:00:06.533 --> 1:00:10.134
I've just made my folks so
unhappy, and I'm so sorry.

1:00:10.136 --> 1:00:14.171
Being sorry next best thing
to being good.

1:00:14.173 --> 1:00:16.540
Humble one suggests
you go sleep.

1:00:17.309 --> 1:00:19.242
I can't sleep.

1:00:19.244 --> 1:00:21.577
I just feel so bad
I can't sleep.

1:00:21.579 --> 1:00:24.112
Problem easily remedied.

1:00:24.114 --> 1:00:25.546
Let me introduce

1:00:25.548 --> 1:00:28.181
yawning man...
very good friend.

1:00:53.905 --> 1:00:57.106
¶ with my yawning song ¶

1:00:57.108 --> 1:01:00.042
¶ I stroll along ¶

¶ and help put people
to sleep ¶

1:01:06.283 --> 1:01:08.716
[yawning to melody]

1:01:18.293 --> 1:01:20.726
¶ If you just can't sleep ¶

1:01:20.728 --> 1:01:23.261

¶ so let's all yawn ¶

1:01:42.379 --> 1:01:44.746
[yawning to melody]

1:01:53.822 --> 1:01:56.689
¶ If the sandman comes ¶

1:01:56.691 --> 1:01:59.191
¶ and his sack he unties ¶

¶ tell him, "go away" ¶

[Yawning to melody]

1:02:28.952 --> 1:02:31.786
¶ If you still can't sleep ¶

1:02:31.788 --> 1:02:34.722
¶ and for slumber you yearn ¶

1:02:34.724 --> 1:02:37.758
¶ if your eyelids burn ¶

1:02:37.760 --> 1:02:40.761
¶ and you squirm

1:03:55.995 --> 1:03:58.261
[Rain falling]

1:03:59.564 --> 1:04:02.264
Jonathan, come and sit down.

1:04:04.534 --> 1:04:07.001
You can't possibly go to work
in weather like this.

1:04:07.003 --> 1:04:09.136
You might just as well relax
and enjoy your breakfast.

1:04:09.138 --> 1:04:10.971
Where's tom?
He's asleep.

1:04:10.973 --> 1:04:12.172
Wake him up.

1:04:12.174 --> 1:04:14.107
Oh, no, let him sleep.
He's so exhausted.

1:04:14.109 --> 1:04:16.042
[Knock on door]

1:04:17.078 --> 1:04:19.044
I wonder who that is.

1:04:20.981 --> 1:04:23.014
Well, gentlemen,
what can I do for you?

1:04:23.016 --> 1:04:25.516
Maybe you can help us.
The treasury has been robbed,

1:04:25.518 --> 1:04:27.885
and we're searching
for the culprits.

1:04:27.887 --> 1:04:29.286
Have you seen any
strangers hereabouts?

1:04:29.288 --> 1:04:31.421
No, I haven't.
Have you, Anna?

1:04:31.423 --> 1:04:32.989
Why, no.

1:04:32.991 --> 1:04:34.323
Have you looked in the forest?

1:04:34.325 --> 1:04:35.991
Yes. We've been
all through it.

1:04:35.993 --> 1:04:38.560
We're about to have breakfast.
Won't you join us?

1:04:38.562 --> 1:04:40.862
Come in, gentlemen.
Make yourselves at home.

1:04:40.864 --> 1:04:42.230
Well, thank you.

1:04:50.940 --> 1:04:54.107
Anna:
Won't you sit down?

1:04:54.109 --> 1:04:55.508
Here you are.

1:04:55.510 --> 1:04:56.642
Soldier:
Thank you.

1:04:56.644 --> 1:04:58.110
You're welcome.

1:04:59.947 --> 1:05:01.146
Very tasty, ma'am.

1:05:01.148 --> 1:05:02.180
Well, thank you.

1:05:02.182 --> 1:05:03.247
Ouch!

1:05:08.420 --> 1:05:11.354
Wake up,
con-fu-shon.

1:05:11.356 --> 1:05:13.622
Soldier: Hey, this
is a coin from it.

1:05:13.624 --> 1:05:16.091
Second soldier: There's no
doubt about it, I swear.

1:05:17.494 --> 1:05:19.126
How now, madam?

1:05:19.128 --> 1:05:20.627
Are you in the habit
of baking your bread

1:05:20.629 --> 1:05:22.261
in the village treasury?

1:05:22.263 --> 1:05:24.329
I haven't the least idea
how it could've got there.

1:05:24.331 --> 1:05:26.898
This coin is part
of the stolen money.

1:05:26.900 --> 1:05:28.299
Where's the rest of it?

1:05:28.301 --> 1:05:30.301
Anna:
Honestly, I don't know.

1:05:30.303 --> 1:05:32.236
I don't even know
how this one got here.

1:05:32.238 --> 1:05:34.605
Soldier:
Huh! A likely story.

1:05:34.607 --> 1:05:36.506
Jonathan: You mean you don't
believe her?

1:05:36.508 --> 1:05:38.374
Are you accusing us
of thievery?

1:05:38.376 --> 1:05:42.077
And you call yourself
honest Jonathan.

1:05:42.079 --> 1:05:43.445
You may call yourself
honest Jonathan,

1:05:43.447 --> 1:05:45.013
but as for me, you're a crook.

1:05:45.015 --> 1:05:46.514
That isn't true!

1:05:46.516 --> 1:05:49.083
Soldier:
He's the thief.

1:05:50.286 --> 1:05:53.186
Don't you dare call
my husband a thief!

1:05:53.188 --> 1:05:54.687
You're both under arrest.

1:05:54.689 --> 1:05:56.922
[Thunder]

1:05:59.493 --> 1:06:02.994
Hey, wake up, huh?
Wake up!

1:06:04.998 --> 1:06:06.364
Wake up!

1:06:06.366 --> 1:06:08.199
Wake up! Help!

1:06:08.201 --> 1:06:10.134
Con-fu-shon!

1:06:14.639 --> 1:06:17.973
Con-fu-shon, wake up!

1:06:23.080 --> 1:06:25.146
[Yawn]

1:06:25.148 --> 1:06:28.983
Honorable yawning man
has very powerful medicine.

1:06:28.985 --> 1:06:32.219
We got to open the door!
Con-fu-shon, some soldiers

1:06:32.221 --> 1:06:34.354
just accused my money
of stealing parents.

1:06:34.356 --> 1:06:36.456
No, I mean, well,
we got to open the door!

1:06:36.458 --> 1:06:38.624
He's not a crook.
Are you awake?

1:06:39.426 --> 1:06:41.259
A Jack-in-the-box.

1:06:41.261 --> 1:06:43.327
Yes, yes, yes!
Come on.

1:06:48.734 --> 1:06:50.667
Jonathan:
Yes, a big mistake.

1:06:50.669 --> 1:06:53.269
You haven't heard the last
of this, my friend. Let me go!

1:06:53.271 --> 1:06:56.205
Take your hands off me!
Take your hands off me!

1:06:58.642 --> 1:07:01.075
Wake up, Jack.
Very quick, wake up.

1:07:01.077 --> 1:07:02.443
[Yawn]

1:07:02.445 --> 1:07:04.511
I'm sleepy.
Go away.

1:07:04.513 --> 1:07:06.145
But... but...
but honorable tom

1:07:06.147 --> 1:07:09.248
need honorable
Jack-in-the-box very much.

1:07:09.250 --> 1:07:11.416
Why didn't you say so
in the first place?

1:07:11.418 --> 1:07:12.417
What can I do?

1:07:12.419 --> 1:07:14.585
Can you open the door?

1:07:14.587 --> 1:07:17.020
Consider it done.

1:07:32.504 --> 1:07:34.036
Done.

1:07:45.315 --> 1:07:47.248
[Rain falling]

The stupid beast won't obey.

1:27:23.138 --> 1:27:25.339
Make way for the town lasher!

1:27:25.341 --> 1:27:27.874
[Cheering]

1:27:40.787 --> 1:27:42.753
[Hoof beats]

1:27:45.390 --> 1:27:47.723
There's the turn.
Get off the road.

1:27:47.725 --> 1:27:50.992
Turn to the right,
you stubborn old nag!

1:27:50.994 --> 1:27:53.461
To the right, Ivan.
To the right.

1:27:53.463 --> 1:27:55.596
I know. I know!

1:27:55.598 --> 1:27:57.564
I can't do anything with it.

1:27:59.701 --> 1:28:01.300
That was fine.

1:28:01.302 --> 1:28:04.269
To the right, Ivan.
To the right.

1:28:04.271 --> 1:28:07.472
There's a crossroad coming.
Go straight ahead.

1:28:07.474 --> 1:28:09.807
[Neigh]

1:28:20.586 --> 1:28:22.652
We'll show them
who the real robbers are.

1:28:23.888 --> 1:28:25.821
Faster! Faster!

1:28:25.823 --> 1:28:28.456
I can't go any faster.

1:28:53.716 --> 1:28:55.315
[Hoof beats]

1:28:58.420 --> 1:29:00.620
We made it! Stop!

1:29:03.324 --> 1:29:05.057
There are the robbers!
They stole the money!

1:29:06.660 --> 1:29:09.727
Hi, mom. Hi, dad.

1:29:11.530 --> 1:29:13.596
Fetch those men!

1:29:20.904 --> 1:29:22.737
Out of my way, donkey boy.

1:29:44.694 --> 1:29:47.494
What have you done with him?
Where's tom?

1:29:47.496 --> 1:29:49.429
Tom: I'm over here,
Woody!

1:29:49.964 --> 1:29:51.930
Here I am.

1:30:14.654 --> 1:30:17.121
No kisses, remember?

1:30:26.665 --> 1:30:30.133
Oh, don't worry, mom.
She does that all the time.

1:30:30.135 --> 1:30:31.634
Woody:
Now, wait a minute.

1:30:31.636 --> 1:30:34.737
This isn't the way
it was supposed to happen.

1:30:34.739 --> 1:30:38.807
Queen: Try it again...
Gently.

1:30:38.809 --> 1:30:42.076
Like... Like this?

1:30:42.078 --> 1:30:43.744
Yes.

1:30:50.051 --> 1:30:52.051
Queenie, you're real.
