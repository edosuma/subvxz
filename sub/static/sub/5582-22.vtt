WEBVTT

00:04.605 --> 00:06.607
*

00:08.676 --> 00:11.245
* Ain't got no money

00:11.279 --> 00:13.147
* No fancy car

00:13.181 --> 00:14.382
* Ain't got no excuses baby

00:14.415 --> 00:16.384
* Hanging by the bar...

00:16.417 --> 00:18.419
Sam

00:18.452 --> 00:20.288
Welcome to Zolfo's.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.124
Order up.

00:23.157 --> 00:24.392
* I don't owe you a thing

00:24.425 --> 00:25.793
* But we ain't getting married

00:25.826 --> 00:29.563
* I ain't buying you
no diamond ring *

00:29.597 --> 00:32.300
* That's all right

00:32.333 --> 00:34.302
Okay, order up in three...

00:34.335 --> 00:35.503
Two...

00:35.536 --> 00:36.504
One.

00:36.537 --> 00:37.838
Go, go, go.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.573
Got to serve it to 'em hot.

00:39.607 --> 00:41.309
Smile.

00:41.342 --> 00:43.177
* I don't owe you a thing

00:43.211 --> 00:44.812
* I don't owe
you a thing *

00:44.845 --> 00:46.247
Bourbon steak.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.848
Signature dish.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.251
It's for you, Grandpa Zolfo.

00:50.284 --> 00:51.519
* ...getting married now

00:51.552 --> 00:55.256
* I ain't buying you
no diamond ring *

00:55.289 --> 00:56.457
Where the hell's the bourbon?

00:56.490 --> 00:57.591
Here you go, Danielle.

00:57.625 --> 00:58.692
Hot.

01:01.795 --> 01:03.397
Where's my paprika?

01:09.170 --> 01:11.605
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:11.639 --> 01:14.308
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:14.342 --> 01:16.710
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:16.744 --> 01:18.146
* How, how, how, how

01:18.179 --> 01:20.448
* Hey, hey

01:26.320 --> 01:27.621
* You gotta come on.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.328
Right with you, fellas.

01:36.164 --> 01:37.898
Hey, Brody, I've been waiting
for your call.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.267
BRODY:
Sorry.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.801
Got caught up.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.370
Where are you?

01:42.403 --> 01:44.572
At the bar.
A little short on help tonight.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.740
It sounds like you
have your hands full, Pride.

01:46.774 --> 01:47.875
Yeah, yeah.

01:47.908 --> 01:49.177
It's always something.

01:49.210 --> 01:50.544
All right. You got an update

01:50.578 --> 01:52.213
on the General Matthews leak?
Talk to me.

01:52.246 --> 01:53.414
All right. The documents

01:53.447 --> 01:54.548
with the privileged
info on the case

01:54.582 --> 01:56.384
that were sent to the outlets,

01:56.417 --> 01:58.786
came from an IP address
here in D.C.

01:58.819 --> 02:00.921
Patton able to get you
an exact location?

02:00.954 --> 02:02.456
Office park
outside of Arlington.

02:02.490 --> 02:05.726
Got a thermal image
of the location.

02:05.759 --> 02:07.461
Looks like some kind
of server farm.

02:07.495 --> 02:08.596
I'll check on it first thing.

02:08.629 --> 02:10.364
Yeah, well, be careful, Brody.

02:10.398 --> 02:12.333
We don't know
what we're dealing with.

02:12.366 --> 02:13.767
Yeah, well, we know someone
wanted to disgrace

02:13.801 --> 02:15.603
General Matthews,
and two people are dead

02:15.636 --> 02:16.770
in connection with it.

02:16.804 --> 02:19.207
We also know they were able

02:19.240 --> 02:20.708
to access our case files.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.843
And that takes skill.

02:22.876 --> 02:24.712
Could be looking
at an Edward Snowden,

02:24.745 --> 02:26.580
or someone worse.

02:26.614 --> 02:29.850
If you need help,
call Director Vance or Gibbs.

02:29.883 --> 02:31.285
You're alone there.

02:32.353 --> 02:34.355
Solitude feels right.

02:34.388 --> 02:37.191
It'll give me a chance
to hear myself think.

02:37.225 --> 02:38.659
You should try it sometime.

02:43.264 --> 02:45.266
Yeah, uh, well,
it won't be tonight.

02:45.299 --> 02:46.500
I gotta go.

02:46.534 --> 02:47.701
We got a case.

02:50.504 --> 02:53.207
So you see anything
odd before the explosion?

02:53.241 --> 02:54.242
Uh, this is New Orleans.
You got to be

02:54.275 --> 02:55.409
a little more specific.

02:55.443 --> 02:57.545
Like someone rushing
in or out

02:57.578 --> 02:58.946
around the time it happened.

02:58.979 --> 03:01.249
Nah, I didn't see
nothing like that.

03:01.282 --> 03:03.684
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

03:07.321 --> 03:08.489
Talk to me.

03:08.522 --> 03:09.990
Explosion happened
in Zolfo's kitchen.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.392
Suspicious circumstances.

03:11.425 --> 03:13.761
No fatalities,
but ten injuries,

03:13.794 --> 03:16.864
including Navy Culinary
Specialist Danielle Jarrett.

03:16.897 --> 03:17.865
Took the brunt of the blast.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.700
She's in town on liberty.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.001
The mom, Elaine,

03:21.034 --> 03:23.003
stepdad, Blake,
they own the place.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.372
Witnesses?

03:24.405 --> 03:26.006
A lot of people heard
the big boom...

03:26.039 --> 03:27.808
ran the other way.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.243
Call Wade.

03:29.277 --> 03:30.778
Have her go
to the hospital.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.980
C.S. Jarrett may
have evidence on her.

03:33.013 --> 03:34.482
On it.

03:40.688 --> 03:43.557
Nearly impossible
to keep these old places

03:43.591 --> 03:46.260
up and running, and then...

03:46.294 --> 03:47.961
something like this happens.

03:47.995 --> 03:49.930
Brought Laurel here
for her sixth birthday.

03:52.366 --> 03:53.834
First big night out.

03:53.867 --> 03:56.437
Got a lot of memories
for a lot of people.

03:56.470 --> 03:57.971
But Arson Squad
doesn't seem to think

03:58.005 --> 03:59.440
that this was an accident,

03:59.473 --> 04:01.975
but they haven't
found any evidence

04:02.009 --> 04:03.577
of what caused the blast.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.613
Take a look at this.

04:07.815 --> 04:08.982
What do you think?

04:10.751 --> 04:12.453
Could be a pipe bomb.

04:12.486 --> 04:14.322
SONJA:
We might have something else.

04:15.556 --> 04:16.724
EMT...

04:16.757 --> 04:18.426
said this was
near Danielle's body

04:18.459 --> 04:19.827
after they pulled her out.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.329
A package?

04:21.362 --> 04:22.863
Well, it could have been
what the bomb came in.

04:22.896 --> 04:24.598
Well, if that were true,

04:24.632 --> 04:26.567
it would have been
obliterated in the blast.

04:26.600 --> 04:27.935
Not necessarily.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.437
Not if it was directional.

04:29.470 --> 04:30.604
All right.

04:30.638 --> 04:32.340
Print it
and get it to Sebastian.

04:38.045 --> 04:40.013
Wow, I got something.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.749
It's the Prince of Pies.

04:41.782 --> 04:42.750
The Prince of what?

04:42.783 --> 04:44.352
No. Anthony Flanders.

04:44.385 --> 04:45.353
You never heard of him?

04:45.386 --> 04:46.754
No.
Come on.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.822
Flanders' Landing.

04:48.856 --> 04:50.424
He's got all those restaurants.

04:50.458 --> 04:52.360
I don't eat at those
kind of places.

04:52.393 --> 04:53.761
Ah, that's right,
all your hookups

04:53.794 --> 04:55.363
get the Michelin Star treatment.

04:55.396 --> 04:56.897
MAN: You son of a bitch,
I'll kill you.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.031
Oh, yeah?
I'd like to see you try.

04:58.065 --> 04:59.367
SONJA:
Pride, that's him.

04:59.400 --> 05:00.501
His print is
on the package.

05:00.534 --> 05:02.403
FLANDERS:
Get off me.

05:02.436 --> 05:04.638
PRIDE:
Break it up, now.
BLAKE: Get away from me.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.507
I come here to pay my respects
and this is how I'm treated?

05:06.540 --> 05:08.376
I want to press
full charges.

05:08.409 --> 05:10.077
Yeah, you come over
here you son of a bitch.
Get your tail

05:10.110 --> 05:11.679
out of here... Mr. Flanders,

05:11.712 --> 05:13.914
charges may be pressed,

05:13.947 --> 05:16.384
but not against him.
What are you
talking about?

05:16.417 --> 05:17.851
Your prints
on a suspicious package

05:17.885 --> 05:19.520
is what I'm talking about.
Let's go.

05:19.553 --> 05:20.754
Get your damn hands off me.

05:22.423 --> 05:23.691
You're under arrest.

05:23.724 --> 05:25.426
On what charge?

05:25.459 --> 05:27.395
Assaulting a Federal Officer,

05:27.428 --> 05:29.563
and suspicion of sabotage.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.112
PRIDE:
What were you doing at Zolfo's

05:45.145 --> 05:46.447
after the explosion?

05:46.480 --> 05:48.048
It was a nice night.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.683
I took a walk.

05:50.718 --> 05:54.922
Been looking
at your record.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.491
Intimidation. Extortion.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.727
Look closer there.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.795
Charged, but never convicted.

06:01.829 --> 06:04.932
Blake Jarrett said you've been
harassing him and his wife.

06:04.965 --> 06:05.899
That guy.

06:07.601 --> 06:10.738
I've been trying
to buy them out for months.

06:10.771 --> 06:12.573
They're too thick-headed
to accept.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.174
You know I got five locations

06:14.207 --> 06:15.943
here in the
Greater New Orleans area.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.978
You know why?

06:18.011 --> 06:19.547
I offer large portions,

06:19.580 --> 06:20.748
at affordable price points.

06:20.781 --> 06:23.717
Package found at
the crime scene.

06:23.751 --> 06:25.553
Handwriting look familiar?

06:25.586 --> 06:28.088
'Cause your prints are on 'em.

06:30.491 --> 06:31.859
You want to tell me
what was inside?

06:34.828 --> 06:35.996
Danielle Jarrett.

06:36.029 --> 06:38.766
She almost died last night.

06:38.799 --> 06:40.734
You know what?

06:40.768 --> 06:42.470
I feel bad for her.

06:42.503 --> 06:43.704
But I didn't do it.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.675
You know,
if her family sold to me,

06:47.708 --> 06:49.076
maybe none of this
would've happened.

06:49.109 --> 06:50.611
That sounds like a confession.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.613
No, it's a fact.

06:52.646 --> 06:54.748
I don't hurt people.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.149
Hey,

06:56.183 --> 06:58.151
I'm the Prince of Pies.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.529
What do you think, King?

07:08.562 --> 07:11.499
He do this?

07:11.532 --> 07:13.534
Not sure.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.936
But we owe it to Danielle
to find out.

07:15.969 --> 07:17.170
Yeah, but we have his prints.

07:17.204 --> 07:18.872
On a scrap of packaging.

07:18.906 --> 07:20.508
Doesn't prove much yet,

07:20.541 --> 07:23.511
till Sebastian tells us
what was in the package.

07:23.544 --> 07:25.178
And we need to know
who delivered it.

07:25.212 --> 07:26.780
I'll head to the hospital,

07:26.814 --> 07:29.082
talk to Danielle, her parents.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.918
Meantime, pull surveillance.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.085
Learn things.

07:35.255 --> 07:37.925
Oh!

07:37.958 --> 07:39.092
God, it hurts!
Almost done here.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.928
Hang in there.
I- I can't. I can't.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.663
Just a few more, Danielle.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.965
The doctor needs to do
this debridement.

07:44.998 --> 07:48.936
I'll remove the shrapnel
so there won't be infections.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.572
You'll have evidence too,
right?.

07:51.605 --> 07:53.106
Yes, dear.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.575
Evidence too.

07:54.608 --> 07:55.976
:
Okay, good.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.778
Where's my mom?

07:57.811 --> 08:00.948
She's right outside, dear.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.517
Doctor, that IV needs
to be reapplied.

08:03.551 --> 08:05.619
I keep trying to get a good
vein, but they're weak.

08:05.653 --> 08:08.622
Here.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.794
Good job, Danielle.
We're all done for now.

08:13.827 --> 08:16.997
:
Get the guy who did this.

08:18.899 --> 08:20.734
We found this.

08:20.768 --> 08:23.637
It came off some
kind of package.

08:23.671 --> 08:26.740
Well, we opened up early,
around all day.

08:26.774 --> 08:28.676
Never saw that package.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.011
Did you notice
any unfamiliar people?

08:31.044 --> 08:32.680
Delivery men, or...

08:32.713 --> 08:35.282
We got deliveries
coming in all the time.

08:35.315 --> 08:38.652
You and I both know
that Flanders done this.

08:38.686 --> 08:39.887
I mean,

08:39.920 --> 08:41.555
I watched you
haul him away yesterday.

08:41.589 --> 08:43.791
We brought him in
for questioning, that's all.

08:43.824 --> 08:45.325
He's been harassing us
for months.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.227
He's pissed we won't
sell him Zolfo's.

08:47.260 --> 08:50.831
It's been in my family
for a century.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.166
Oh, this is all
my fault, isn't it?

08:53.200 --> 08:54.602
No.

08:54.635 --> 08:56.704
You see this, Agent Pride?

08:56.737 --> 08:58.338
You see what Flanders done?

08:58.371 --> 08:59.973
I could kill him.

09:00.007 --> 09:02.275
You need to keep a cool head,
Mr. Jarrett.

09:02.309 --> 09:04.344
Mm.
WADE:
Ah.

09:04.377 --> 09:07.014
They gave Danielle a sedative,
she's resting.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.248
You can be with her.

09:08.281 --> 09:09.983
Oh, good.
Thank you

09:14.922 --> 09:16.757
Danielle say anything
about the blast?

09:16.790 --> 09:18.125
No.

09:18.158 --> 09:20.327
Just that she wanted to
get the guy who did it.

09:21.929 --> 09:23.864
The shrapnel from her body?

09:23.897 --> 09:25.866
I noticed a...

09:25.899 --> 09:28.035
partial number on a piece.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.704
Maybe serial number
from the bomb.

09:30.738 --> 09:31.972
Let's get it to Sebastian.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.641
Thanks, Loretta.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.776
Mm-hmm.

09:35.809 --> 09:37.911
Anything on surveillance?

09:37.945 --> 09:39.713
We scanned the street
and traffic cams.

09:39.747 --> 09:41.248
No luck on the mystery delivery.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.050
But then I got to thinking.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.653
How you took Laurel to Zolfo's
on her first big night out.

09:45.686 --> 09:48.121
Yeah.
And how my mom

09:48.155 --> 09:51.391
took me and my brother first
time we visited New Orleans.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.794
Lots of pictures,
probably too many.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.663
I wore this little tuxedo.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.665
Man, I was looking studly.

09:57.698 --> 10:00.067
Did you also learn
to use the little fork?

10:00.100 --> 10:01.802
No, I learned that in cotillion.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.205
Damn.

10:05.238 --> 10:07.808
I was supposed to be at the bar,
let the electrician in.

10:07.841 --> 10:08.876
You want to go?

10:08.909 --> 10:11.211
No.

10:11.244 --> 10:13.346
No time, I'll reschedule.
Pictures.

10:13.380 --> 10:16.917
Right. So we got Zolfo's
reservation list,

10:16.950 --> 10:18.085
called everyone on it,

10:18.118 --> 10:19.687
scanned the selfies.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.722
And we think our suspect
could be in one of these.

10:25.993 --> 10:27.661
PRIDE:
Stop.

10:27.695 --> 10:29.830
Right there, zoom in.

10:29.863 --> 10:31.098
The guy with the package.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.004
Run facial recognition.

10:45.846 --> 10:48.982
JJ, what are you doing here
with the redfish?

10:49.016 --> 10:51.118
Remember when you plate it,
how did I teach you?

10:51.151 --> 10:52.452
Diagonal right?
JJ: Right.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.788
Lots of butter.
Got it.

10:54.822 --> 10:55.823
Keep the plates clean.

10:58.225 --> 11:00.160
Excuse me, you're in the way
of my amuse-bouche.

11:00.193 --> 11:02.029
Amuse-bouche this.

11:02.062 --> 11:04.464
We're federal agents.
And, uh, we have you on camera

11:04.497 --> 11:08.068
delivering a very suspicious
package to Zolfo's.

11:08.101 --> 11:10.904
And ten minutes later,
it went kablooey.

11:10.938 --> 11:12.039
You think that I did that?

11:12.072 --> 11:13.273
Well, I think
your boss Flanders

11:13.306 --> 11:14.942
put you up to it.

11:14.975 --> 11:17.277
Talk now, and we might
cut you a deal.

11:17.310 --> 11:19.012
I got nothing to say.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.213
Well, we know you got a record.

11:20.247 --> 11:22.049
Using and selling

11:22.082 --> 11:24.051
cocaine, heroin...

11:24.084 --> 11:26.153
Keep it down, okay?
I'm clean now.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.956
That's old news.
I've reinvented myself.

11:28.989 --> 11:31.058
Oh, so is that why
you've been missing

11:31.091 --> 11:33.493
your meetings
with your probation officer?

11:33.526 --> 11:35.328
Look, we can arrest you
right now.

11:35.362 --> 11:38.198
So why don't you just tell us
what was in the box?

11:47.875 --> 11:49.777
Hey, babies.

11:50.978 --> 11:51.979
Rats?

11:52.012 --> 11:53.446
You delivered rats?

11:53.480 --> 11:55.182
Well, it's not about the rats,

11:55.215 --> 11:56.750
it's about the mites
that are on the rats.

11:56.784 --> 11:58.051
Please, just stop talking.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.486
Health inspector detects them,

11:59.519 --> 12:01.088
shuts down the restaurant.

12:01.121 --> 12:03.023
And Flanders had nothing
to do it.
Come on.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.759
We found his fingerprints
on the packaging.

12:05.793 --> 12:07.828
That's 'cause I got
the package from his office.

12:07.861 --> 12:10.831
Look, Flanders said that
if he got Zolfo's,

12:10.864 --> 12:13.066
he'd make me the head chef.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.202
Go big or go home, right?

12:18.371 --> 12:21.408
Wash your hands 'fore
you go back in there.

12:21.441 --> 12:24.077
Sebastian analyzed the package.

12:24.111 --> 12:27.014
Significant traces of rat DNA.

12:27.047 --> 12:28.248
BRODY:
He give you anything else?

12:28.281 --> 12:29.817
Not so far.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.084
We'll start fresh
in the morning.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.085
Ah!

12:32.119 --> 12:33.286
You okay?

12:33.320 --> 12:35.288
Yeah. Yeah.

12:35.322 --> 12:37.891
Just, uh...

12:37.925 --> 12:40.861
doing some electrical repairs
at the bar.

12:40.894 --> 12:42.362
Tell me about your day.

12:42.395 --> 12:44.097
Did you make it
to the server farm?

12:44.131 --> 12:46.834
Yeah, only the place
was cleaned out.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.869
Nothing but empty offices.

12:48.902 --> 12:50.938
Leasing company said
the space was rented

12:50.971 --> 12:52.505
to something called
Channel Industries,

12:52.539 --> 12:55.175
but no contact info
for them at all.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.978
Pride?

12:58.011 --> 12:59.346
You there?

12:59.379 --> 13:00.848
Sorry.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.349
Mind went to the other case.

13:02.382 --> 13:05.518
Too focused on Flanders
and this mysterious package.

13:05.552 --> 13:08.155
Haven't thought
about other scenarios.

13:08.188 --> 13:09.857
Yeah, well, you're a chef.
I mean, you'd know

13:09.890 --> 13:12.259
better than anyone
what went on in that kitchen.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.360
Brody, you're brilliant.

13:13.393 --> 13:14.561
Gotta go.

13:16.864 --> 13:18.531
Glad I could help?

13:25.939 --> 13:28.508
Meredith Brody?
Agents Walker and Davis, FBI.

13:28.541 --> 13:29.910
Need to come with us.

13:29.943 --> 13:30.911
I'm NCIS.

13:30.944 --> 13:32.946
We know who you are.
Please.

13:34.081 --> 13:35.282
What are you doing?

13:35.315 --> 13:37.284
Confiscating
your computer.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.152
Let's go, please. Now.

13:39.186 --> 13:40.387
This must be a misunderstanding.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.555
I need to call Director Vance.

13:45.192 --> 13:47.394
Sorry to keep you up so late,
Sebastian.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.062
But if we can figure out

13:49.096 --> 13:51.164
what Danielle was doing
when the blast happened...

13:51.198 --> 13:53.300
Figure out the source
of the blast itself,

13:53.333 --> 13:55.002
I.D. the bomber. Let's do it.

13:55.035 --> 13:56.036
Yeah, what do you got?

13:56.069 --> 13:58.071
Uh, okay, so I determined

13:58.105 --> 14:00.340
that the shrapnel
pulled from Danielle

14:00.373 --> 14:02.209
was made of steel

14:02.242 --> 14:03.610
and had traces of propane on it.

14:03.643 --> 14:07.147
Steel and propane.

14:07.180 --> 14:10.417
All right, well,
to make bourbon steak,

14:10.450 --> 14:13.020
you gotta sear it.

14:13.053 --> 14:15.388
All right,
then you add the mushrooms,

14:15.422 --> 14:17.224
the bourbon...

14:20.360 --> 14:24.097
And then to flambé it, you...

14:24.131 --> 14:26.366
Cooking torch.

14:28.301 --> 14:31.905
No, I got the, uh, the kitchen's
cooking torch here somewhere.

14:31.939 --> 14:33.406
Yeah.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.408
There's... it's got
a lot of smoke damage,

14:35.442 --> 14:37.077
but it didn't cause the blast.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.947
How easy would it be to sabotage
something like that?

14:39.980 --> 14:41.614
Well, you just...

14:41.648 --> 14:43.316
got to crack the seal

14:43.350 --> 14:44.918
and then light it.

14:44.952 --> 14:46.319
So... Ow!

14:46.353 --> 14:48.621
Sebastian! You all right?

14:48.655 --> 14:50.257
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.425
Yeah. I'm, uh,
I'm okay, I'm okay.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.361
I, uh...

14:54.394 --> 14:55.628
All right, well...

14:55.662 --> 14:57.330
I guess we know that

14:57.364 --> 15:01.101
a more powerful torch
than this one caused the blast.

15:01.134 --> 15:04.037
Pro chefs use
industrial torches.

15:04.071 --> 15:06.073
Danielle might have
brought her own.

15:06.106 --> 15:08.976
Do you remember
that there was a, uh,

15:09.009 --> 15:11.244
a piece of shrapnel pulled
from Danielle's body

15:11.278 --> 15:13.180
that had, uh,
that had numbers on it?

15:13.213 --> 15:14.514
Yeah.

15:14.547 --> 15:15.715
Well, I matched it
to another piece

15:15.748 --> 15:17.584
from the crime scene, and, uh...

15:17.617 --> 15:19.119
Where is it?

15:19.152 --> 15:20.587
Here, here.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.255
"N-A-V-

15:22.289 --> 15:23.623
I-H-eight..."

15:23.656 --> 15:26.226
That's Navy requisition.

15:26.259 --> 15:29.196
Danielle is a CS
aboard the USS Hawk.

15:29.229 --> 15:31.531
Well, someone on board could
have sabotaged her torch

15:31.564 --> 15:32.565
before she left the ship.

15:34.434 --> 15:37.470
This wasn't about
the restaurant at all.

15:37.504 --> 15:40.640
It's about Danielle.

15:40.673 --> 15:42.675
She was the target.

15:53.753 --> 15:54.521
ESTES:
You think someone wanted

15:54.554 --> 15:56.056
to hurt CS Jarrett?

15:56.089 --> 15:57.590
SONJA:
Captain Estes, evidence suggests

15:57.624 --> 15:59.526
she was the target
of a bombing.

15:59.559 --> 16:02.462
The sabotaged torch
she used came from your ship.

16:02.495 --> 16:04.331
Removing equipment
from the ship

16:04.364 --> 16:06.266
without permission
is against regulation.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.368
We have a serial number.

16:08.401 --> 16:10.070
You said she moved
up the ranks fast.

16:10.103 --> 16:12.505
Maybe she stepped
on someone's toes.

16:12.539 --> 16:15.542
Jarrett was the best Culinary
Specialist we've ever had.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.244
Morale's been at
an all-time high

16:17.277 --> 16:19.079
since she started
cooking for the crew.

16:19.112 --> 16:22.482
1,300 mouths to feed,
three times a day.

16:22.515 --> 16:26.086
It's 24/7 job
and Jarrett was up for the task.

16:26.119 --> 16:27.687
Everybody loved her.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.122
Burke.

16:29.156 --> 16:30.623
Sir?

16:30.657 --> 16:32.759
CS Burke.
He worked with Jarrett

16:32.792 --> 16:34.494
and has agreed
to cooperate fully.

16:34.527 --> 16:37.164
Burke, did you see Jarrett
take a torch from the ship?

16:39.299 --> 16:41.268
We're just trying to figure out
who hurt her.

16:43.136 --> 16:44.437
Yeah, she took a torch off ship.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.139
But it was
only because

16:46.173 --> 16:48.308
she was going to cook
at her family's restaurant.

16:48.341 --> 16:51.111
I watched her pull it
from her locker myself,

16:51.144 --> 16:53.046
check it, and then leave.

16:53.080 --> 16:53.780
Where's the locker?

16:53.813 --> 16:55.215
This way, ma'am.

16:59.319 --> 17:01.721
SONJA:
Thanks.

17:06.293 --> 17:07.260
Hmm.

17:07.294 --> 17:09.129
"DRC"?

17:09.162 --> 17:10.497
Deployed Resiliency Counselor.

17:10.530 --> 17:11.831
It's resource for sailors

17:11.864 --> 17:13.466
to be able to speak anonymously
with a counselor

17:13.500 --> 17:15.568
about any personal issues
they may be having.

17:15.602 --> 17:17.670
She share any "issues" with you?

17:17.704 --> 17:20.707
No, but she seemed worried.

17:20.740 --> 17:23.443
She's been making
a lot of calls to shore

17:23.476 --> 17:25.345
on the POTS line
past couple of days.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.680
Always seems upset afterwards.

17:30.483 --> 17:32.519
Whatever she was worried about,

17:32.552 --> 17:34.254
it doesn't seem to be
about the ship.

17:34.287 --> 17:36.156
You get the records
of those calls?

17:36.189 --> 17:38.091
Sonja's in the radio room now.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.692
They're gonna get us a file.

17:39.726 --> 17:43.763
As for DRC, Danielle never made
an appointment with a counselor.

17:43.796 --> 17:45.865
So she's making
ship-to-shore calls,

17:45.898 --> 17:48.701
seems worried,
no one knows why?

17:48.735 --> 17:51.671
Yeah, it all boils down
to who had access to that torch.

17:51.704 --> 17:54.307
If it wasn't tampered with
on board that ship,

17:54.341 --> 17:56.576
had to be on shore.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.678
That's the hospital.

17:58.711 --> 18:01.181
Danielle's awake.
I'm heading over.

18:01.214 --> 18:02.449
Maybe she can
help us figure out

18:02.482 --> 18:04.417
who tried to kill her.

18:04.451 --> 18:06.853
DAVIS: You want to explain
why you were trespassing

18:06.886 --> 18:08.321
on government property?

18:08.355 --> 18:09.422
BRODY:
I was investigating a company

18:09.456 --> 18:10.690
called Channel Industries.

18:10.723 --> 18:13.293
Are you saying
it's a government front?

18:13.326 --> 18:15.295
We're asking the questions.

18:15.328 --> 18:18.165
You're here because someone
hacked into a server farm.

18:18.198 --> 18:22.369
Look, I am here on
an official NCIS investigation.

18:22.402 --> 18:23.903
Contact Director Vance.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.472
He give you permission

18:25.505 --> 18:26.773
to photograph
this government facility?

18:26.806 --> 18:28.608
This is Washington D.C.

18:28.641 --> 18:30.643
Isn't that what people do?

18:31.644 --> 18:33.713
Sorry I'm late.

18:33.746 --> 18:36.249
John Russo, Homeland Security.

18:36.283 --> 18:38.751
Well, I see you've been
showing Special Agent Brody

18:38.785 --> 18:40.620
your patented FBI charm.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.255
Sadly, we need her back.

18:42.289 --> 18:44.491
This a Homeland Security
operation.

18:44.524 --> 18:46.659
Mmm.
DAVIS: How come nobody
notified us?

18:46.693 --> 18:48.561
I'm notifying you now.

18:48.595 --> 18:49.896
As well as your SAC.

18:49.929 --> 18:52.732
Agent Brody came to D.C.
under our authority.

18:52.765 --> 18:55.168
She didn't mention it.

18:55.202 --> 18:57.770
Maybe because
you didn't ask nicely.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.906
No need walking us out.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.777
You want to tell me
what this is about?

19:04.811 --> 19:06.913
Yeah, I will.
Just not right now.

19:06.946 --> 19:09.382
Agents Butler and Lake will
take you back to the Stanbridge.

19:09.416 --> 19:10.817
I'll meet you
at the hotel.

19:10.850 --> 19:12.852
Wait a minute. How do you
know where I'm staying?

19:12.885 --> 19:15.788
Same way I knew you'd be here.

19:15.822 --> 19:18.225
Believe me, DHS is
just as interested

19:18.258 --> 19:19.892
in what happened to
General Matthews as you are.

19:19.926 --> 19:23.696
We'd just rather not involve
the FBI for now.

19:23.730 --> 19:25.665
Loose lips and all.

19:25.698 --> 19:28.835
By the way, you're welcome.

19:35.575 --> 19:38.978
MAN: So I brought you
some beet salad,

19:39.011 --> 19:41.581
my favorite
shrimp and grits,

19:41.614 --> 19:44.217
and then a whole bunch of sweets
from Willa Jean.

19:44.251 --> 19:46.319
We can't have

19:46.353 --> 19:48.555
the brightest chef in the city
eating hospital food.

19:48.588 --> 19:50.423
We're gonna get you
up and at 'em

19:50.457 --> 19:52.292
and cooking in no time,
Danielle.

19:52.325 --> 19:53.460
Thanks, John.

19:53.493 --> 19:55.395
Smells awful good
in here, Mr. Besh.

19:55.428 --> 19:56.696
Hey, King, how are you?

19:56.729 --> 19:58.298
Good, John.
Good seeing you.

19:58.331 --> 20:00.667
Thanks for being here.
Oh, listen,
thank you.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.235
Danielle...

20:02.269 --> 20:03.536
I'm Special Agent Pride.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.672
NCIS.

20:05.705 --> 20:06.873
How you doing?

20:06.906 --> 20:08.408
I'm okay.

20:08.441 --> 20:10.710
Could I talk to you alone

20:10.743 --> 20:12.479
for a few minutes?

20:12.512 --> 20:13.713
Yeah, sure.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.449
Take care.
Okay.

20:16.483 --> 20:18.518
Thanks, John.
We'll walk you out.

20:18.551 --> 20:19.852
We'll be right
outside, Danielle.

20:20.987 --> 20:23.656
You always put on a brave face?

20:23.690 --> 20:25.658
I'm a sailor.

20:25.692 --> 20:27.960
You were also the target

20:27.994 --> 20:29.596
last night.

20:29.629 --> 20:30.597
Someone sabotaged

20:30.630 --> 20:34.401
the torch you were using.

20:34.434 --> 20:35.668
Can you think of anyone else

20:35.702 --> 20:37.236
who might have had access to it?

20:38.471 --> 20:39.906
Just me.

20:39.939 --> 20:43.410
Your co-worker said
you are safety-conscious, so...

20:43.443 --> 20:44.644
You went to the ship?

20:46.479 --> 20:48.748
Captain Estes is going
to take me to captain's mast

20:48.781 --> 20:50.016
for removing that thing.

20:50.049 --> 20:51.884
Danielle, our forensic
specialist said

20:51.918 --> 20:52.985
it looks like sabotage.

20:53.019 --> 20:54.354
He a cook?

20:55.388 --> 20:57.256
Uh...

20:59.459 --> 21:02.429
Tell me about DRC.

21:02.462 --> 21:04.831
You were thinking about,
uh, contacting a counselor?

21:04.864 --> 21:07.033
Had something to do
with some upsetting phone calls

21:07.066 --> 21:08.468
you were having.

21:08.501 --> 21:10.570
That's none of your business.

21:10.603 --> 21:14.774
It is if it has to do with
why someone tried to kill you.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.643
King, you know, I'm sorry.

21:16.676 --> 21:18.645
I don't really feel
like talking anymore.

21:18.678 --> 21:20.012
I need to rest.

21:20.046 --> 21:23.516
I hear you, Danielle.

21:23.550 --> 21:27.854
So, uh... call me
when you're ready, all right?

21:27.887 --> 21:29.522
Aah.
Sorry, hon.

21:29.556 --> 21:32.759
It's just these
collapsed veins of yours.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.661
Just gonna be hard.

21:36.429 --> 21:38.931
PRIDE:
Collapsed veins.

21:38.965 --> 21:41.401
Same thing you saw
when Danielle was admitted.

21:41.434 --> 21:43.069
Thoughts?

21:43.102 --> 21:45.071
With the scarring
on her arms,

21:45.104 --> 21:48.007
the most likely explanation
is IV drug use.

21:52.579 --> 21:53.846
See?

21:53.880 --> 21:56.416
That doesn't look
like anything recent.

21:56.449 --> 21:59.586
Though I've seen more than one
chef struggle with addiction.

21:59.619 --> 22:01.588
Maybe she started
using again,

22:01.621 --> 22:02.955
trying to get out of it.

22:02.989 --> 22:04.824
Why she was
considering DRC.

22:04.857 --> 22:06.359
It's just hard to believe
we're talking

22:06.393 --> 22:08.027
about the same girl
I saw yesterday.

22:08.060 --> 22:10.697
Hell-bent on catching a suspect.

22:10.730 --> 22:14.567
Something changed when
I told her she was the target.

22:14.601 --> 22:17.437
Like she's protecting something.

22:17.470 --> 22:18.971
Or someone.

22:19.005 --> 22:21.474
I can pull Danielle's medical
records for tox screens.

22:22.542 --> 22:25.578
Ah, hang on a sec.

22:25.612 --> 22:26.913
Oh, come on.

22:26.946 --> 22:28.448
This is the price you pay

22:28.481 --> 22:30.383
for canceling
with an electrician.

22:30.417 --> 22:31.718
A six-hour window.

22:31.751 --> 22:33.453
What?
Don't they know

22:33.486 --> 22:35.021
people need to work?

22:35.054 --> 22:36.989
It's a vast conspiracy.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.858
Juggling act is what it is.

22:38.891 --> 22:41.528
Work, bar, trying to keep
an eye on Laurel.

22:41.561 --> 22:43.129
Oh, I can relate.

22:43.162 --> 22:46.666
CJ with three baseball leagues,
Danny getting ready to graduate,

22:46.699 --> 22:47.967
me here at the job.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.836
Yeah, we need help.
Um, no.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.704
You need help.

22:51.738 --> 22:54.574
But doing it all on your own
gives you a sense of control.

22:54.607 --> 22:55.908
Fills the space.

22:55.942 --> 22:57.610
:
Well, listen to you.

22:57.644 --> 22:58.945
So what do we do about it?

22:58.978 --> 23:00.480
Give each other a hug?

23:00.513 --> 23:01.814
Drop out?

23:01.848 --> 23:03.149
Tahiti maybe?

23:03.182 --> 23:05.017
Say no more. I'm in.

23:08.521 --> 23:09.822
All right, Brody.

23:09.856 --> 23:11.691
Yeah, call me
when you know more.

23:11.724 --> 23:13.560
Merri okay?
Yeah.

23:13.593 --> 23:15.828
May have a lead
in the General Matthews case.

23:15.862 --> 23:17.163
DHS connection.

23:17.196 --> 23:19.165
Well, we may have a lead
on Danielle as well.

23:19.198 --> 23:21.000
Drug theory might be right.

23:21.033 --> 23:22.902
Danielle was using again?

23:22.935 --> 23:27.139
Emptied her bank account of 15K
the morning she got here

23:27.173 --> 23:28.841
and called that
burner phone three times

23:28.875 --> 23:30.510
before she took liberty.

23:30.543 --> 23:32.912
None of that tells us
who tried to kill her.

23:32.945 --> 23:34.914
I might have
something that could.

23:34.947 --> 23:37.450
That was Captain Estes.

23:37.484 --> 23:40.453
E-mailed secure recordings
of the calls Danielle made

23:40.487 --> 23:41.788
to that burner phone.

23:41.821 --> 23:42.789
PRIDE:
Play the most recent.

23:42.822 --> 23:44.123
You got it.

23:46.025 --> 23:48.828
DANIELLE: Meet me under the
Crescent City Bridge tomorrow.

23:48.861 --> 23:50.563
MAN:
You have the cash?

23:50.597 --> 23:52.098
DANIELLE:
Yeah, I'll have it.

23:52.131 --> 23:53.666
MAN: Okay, all right,
but just don't be late.

23:53.700 --> 23:54.701
I don't want to get caught.

23:55.868 --> 23:57.837
SONJA:
I smell a rat.

24:03.142 --> 24:04.677
Taylor.

24:04.711 --> 24:07.680
Got a couple more
questions for you.

24:07.714 --> 24:09.549
Health Department
already talked to me.

24:09.582 --> 24:11.551
It's not about
your pets, you idiot.

24:11.584 --> 24:14.220
Nah, it's about your little
meeting with Danielle.

24:14.253 --> 24:15.988
Is this your stuff?

24:16.022 --> 24:17.957
You don't need
a search warrant for that?

24:17.990 --> 24:19.959
No, 'cause I gave him permission
'cause this is my property

24:19.992 --> 24:22.194
and my reputation
you're putting on the line here.

24:22.228 --> 24:25.097
Well, look at what we have here.

24:25.131 --> 24:28.100
Oh, baby, sugar and spice.

24:37.109 --> 24:39.579
Taylor, stop!

24:39.612 --> 24:41.748
Percy, I'm in the truck!

25:02.034 --> 25:03.570
Get in!

25:07.206 --> 25:10.076
Where is he?

25:10.109 --> 25:12.979
SONJA:
There he is. Alley.

25:18.718 --> 25:20.820
All right.

25:25.157 --> 25:27.660
All right, where'd he go?

25:29.996 --> 25:32.064
No, I think we lost him.

25:34.066 --> 25:35.602
Nah, check this out.

25:38.270 --> 25:40.773
The hell are you doing?

25:40.807 --> 25:43.275
Using the
360-degree camera.

25:48.815 --> 25:50.549
Yeah, well,
I still don't see him.

25:52.218 --> 25:54.120
Yeah, he's got
to be here somewhere.

25:54.153 --> 25:55.187
Something under
the dumpster there.

25:55.221 --> 25:58.224
Does that look like a foot?

26:03.630 --> 26:05.632
LASALLE: You can run,
but you can't hide.

26:10.069 --> 26:12.071
Gotcha.

26:22.749 --> 26:24.383
LASALLE:
So we asked around.

26:24.416 --> 26:27.386
It seems that
you and Danielle

26:27.419 --> 26:29.388
have known each other
for a while,

26:29.421 --> 26:33.392
used to cook at Raul's
together back in the day.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.261
Yeah, we worked
the line together.

26:35.294 --> 26:36.395
So what?

26:36.428 --> 26:38.998
So you used to deal to her.

26:39.031 --> 26:41.133
Why are you coming at me
for this again?

26:41.167 --> 26:43.803
Because you keep lying to us,
all right?

26:43.836 --> 26:45.137
You didn't tell us
you met Danielle

26:45.171 --> 26:46.673
under the Crescent City
Connection,

26:46.706 --> 26:50.677
and she gave you
$15,000 in cash.

26:50.710 --> 26:53.012
Come on, Taylor.

26:53.045 --> 26:55.347
What happened, huh?

26:55.381 --> 26:56.883
What made you turn on her?

26:56.916 --> 26:59.018
Is she safe?

26:59.051 --> 27:01.888
Uh, no, which is why
you're sitting here,

27:01.921 --> 27:03.089
'cause she got hurt.

27:03.122 --> 27:04.957
She's at a hospital
though, right?

27:04.991 --> 27:09.061
So there's police or-or guards
or something, right

27:09.095 --> 27:12.231
What are you trying
to say, Taylor?

27:12.264 --> 27:14.934
All right, look,
you got it wrong, okay?

27:14.967 --> 27:16.202
Yeah, I used to sell

27:16.235 --> 27:17.436
to Danielle.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.171
That was before the Navy though.

27:19.205 --> 27:20.773
Sh-She's clean now.

27:20.807 --> 27:22.174
But why meet up with her?

27:22.208 --> 27:24.677
She needed my help.

27:24.711 --> 27:26.078
That's what the money was for.

27:26.112 --> 27:29.081
Hmm, so what kind of help
does $15,000 get

27:29.115 --> 27:30.683
from someone like you?

27:30.717 --> 27:33.385
Time-share in Boca Raton.

27:33.419 --> 27:34.787
I have a cousin--

27:34.821 --> 27:37.256
he's in the vacation business.

27:37.289 --> 27:38.958
It was a cash deal.

27:38.991 --> 27:40.927
You expect us to believe that?

27:42.294 --> 27:45.798
Danielle, she wanted
to disappear, okay?

27:45.832 --> 27:47.466
She came to me trying
to find a place

27:47.499 --> 27:49.035
where no one could get to her.

27:50.803 --> 27:52.304
She was afraid

27:52.338 --> 27:54.774
of someone.

27:54.807 --> 27:57.376
And I swear it was not me.

28:00.146 --> 28:02.248
BRODY:
So, Agent Russo,

28:02.281 --> 28:04.416
we have never met before.

28:04.450 --> 28:07.954
You want to explain why you told
the FBI we're working together?

28:07.987 --> 28:10.289
General Matthews.

28:10.322 --> 28:12.291
That's why
you're here, right?

28:12.324 --> 28:14.260
Someone leaked your
case files to the news.

28:14.293 --> 28:17.263
Ruined his career.

28:17.296 --> 28:20.132
And his appointment to be
my boss at Homeland Security.

28:20.166 --> 28:22.001
You're investigating
the leak too.

28:22.034 --> 28:24.336
You got to try some of this.

28:24.370 --> 28:27.840
No, no, no, they marinate
the tri-tip in Dr. Pepper.

28:27.874 --> 28:29.175
Come on.

28:29.208 --> 28:31.077
I thought I was
buying you dinner.

28:31.110 --> 28:32.478
Saved you the receipt.

28:38.918 --> 28:42.822
So what else you got?

28:42.855 --> 28:44.723
Besides Channel Industries.

28:46.025 --> 28:48.327
I know about Channel
Industries, Brody.

28:50.296 --> 28:52.131
Do you prefer Meredith?

28:52.164 --> 28:54.333
Either one.

28:56.068 --> 28:58.070
Brody.

28:59.271 --> 29:01.273
Okay, Brody.

29:01.307 --> 29:04.443
So what do you know
about Channel Industries?

29:04.476 --> 29:06.312
What do you know?

29:06.345 --> 29:08.180
I know they're NSA.

29:08.214 --> 29:10.549
Servers are backups
for the declassified intel.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.118
Meaning they were
easier to hack.

29:12.151 --> 29:13.552
Suspect in the
General Matthews leak

29:13.585 --> 29:15.554
could have breached the servers,

29:15.587 --> 29:18.424
used them as a platform,
then disappeared.

29:20.026 --> 29:21.460
You're almost right.

29:21.493 --> 29:23.329
He didn't disappear.

29:23.362 --> 29:24.897
My guys just got access

29:24.931 --> 29:26.799
to the Channel Industries
server proxies.

29:29.335 --> 29:30.803
You mind?

29:30.837 --> 29:32.071
No.

29:34.506 --> 29:36.342
So what was the original
IP address you traced

29:36.375 --> 29:37.509
back to the server farm?

29:39.211 --> 29:41.547
Let's work together.

29:41.580 --> 29:44.483
You give me the IP, my team
gets the original location.

30:01.233 --> 30:03.035
Boom.

30:03.069 --> 30:04.603
We got him.

30:04.636 --> 30:08.507
Glenn Franklin, part of the tech
staff at Channel Industries.

30:08.540 --> 30:10.376
Not exactly Dr. Evil, huh?

30:12.378 --> 30:14.080
Let's go get him.

30:14.113 --> 30:15.814
Let's do it.

30:25.257 --> 30:26.492
Federal agents
with a warrant!

30:26.525 --> 30:27.960
Homeland Security!

30:27.994 --> 30:30.196
AGENT: Clear!

30:30.229 --> 30:31.898
BRODY: Clear.

30:42.541 --> 30:44.877
Suicide.

30:51.617 --> 30:53.119
Oh, Pride, you're here.

30:53.152 --> 30:54.987
That's so weird, I was
just about to text you.

30:55.021 --> 30:56.655
And then you,
like, appeared.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.190
You thinking
the same thing I am,

30:58.224 --> 30:59.892
some kind of
telepathy maybe?

30:59.926 --> 31:01.527
Not telepathy, Sebastian;
Loretta called me.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.329
Oh, okay. Well, that would
have been my second guess.

31:03.362 --> 31:05.664
But hey, look. Um,
I've been analyzing

31:05.697 --> 31:07.299
the seal on that torch.

31:07.333 --> 31:09.001
Some kind of knife was used
to tamper with it.

31:09.035 --> 31:10.336
I was hoping maybe you could
shed some light on it.

31:10.369 --> 31:11.904
Put a pin in
that one, Sebastian.

31:11.938 --> 31:14.206
I've got something I need
to talk to Pride about.

31:14.240 --> 31:16.275
PRIDE:
You get Danielle's

31:16.308 --> 31:17.944
hospital records back?
I did,

31:17.977 --> 31:20.212
but I don't believe Danielle
was hurt over drugs, Dwayne.

31:20.246 --> 31:21.680
Hang on.

31:21.713 --> 31:23.582
The electrician...
No!

31:23.615 --> 31:25.017
Now...

31:27.053 --> 31:28.654
You need help with the bar.

31:28.687 --> 31:30.689
I know it's hard to give up.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.058
Loretta...

31:32.091 --> 31:34.060
Do it and consider that a nudge.

31:34.093 --> 31:36.095
Now, like you say,
"learn things,"

31:36.128 --> 31:38.564
I looked into
Danielle's medical history

31:38.597 --> 31:40.599
to see if there
was any drug abuse.

31:40.632 --> 31:44.703
I needed her family's records
for comparison.

31:44.736 --> 31:46.538
Found these.

31:46.572 --> 31:52.178
Emergency room visits for
broken bones, concussions, cuts.

31:52.211 --> 31:54.380
Accidents in Zolfo's kitchen.

31:54.413 --> 31:58.184
Well, that's what
the ER Admission says, but...

31:58.217 --> 32:01.420
take a look at these injuries.

32:01.453 --> 32:04.056
Also, this isn't
Danielle's medical records,

32:04.090 --> 32:05.524
they're her mother's.

32:05.557 --> 32:09.328
Danielle's step-father,
Blake, filled out the forms.

32:09.361 --> 32:10.696
Every one of them.

32:10.729 --> 32:12.664
Pride,

32:12.698 --> 32:15.734
I think he was abusing Elaine,

32:15.767 --> 32:17.469
and Danielle got in the way.

32:17.503 --> 32:21.040
Most recent fall,

32:21.073 --> 32:23.409
week ago.

32:23.442 --> 32:25.077
Day after that,

32:25.111 --> 32:29.415
Danielle started making calls
to a burner phone.

32:29.448 --> 32:32.084
Condo,
draining her bank account,

32:32.118 --> 32:33.552
thinking about talking
to the DRC.

32:33.585 --> 32:35.154
All for Elaine.

32:35.187 --> 32:38.190
Why didn't either one of them
say something?

32:38.224 --> 32:41.093
Well, that's why victims
of abuse are always quiet,

32:41.127 --> 32:44.263
because of finances, religion.

32:44.296 --> 32:47.366
In this case, maybe the
restaurant's reputation.

32:47.399 --> 32:49.768
Or Elaine just couldn't get out
from underneath his thumb.

32:49.801 --> 32:54.240
And despite the physical pain,
she may still love and fear him.

32:54.273 --> 32:56.375
That's what abusers do.

32:56.408 --> 32:58.110
That's where their power lies.

33:01.147 --> 33:02.648
No, no, I got to get this one.

33:02.681 --> 33:04.683
It's the hospital.

33:04.716 --> 33:06.285
Pride.

33:06.318 --> 33:08.120
Agent Pride, it's Danielle.

33:08.154 --> 33:09.121
I need to talk to you.

33:09.155 --> 33:10.156
Danielle, you all right?

33:13.425 --> 33:14.460
What is it?

33:14.493 --> 33:15.761
I'll let you know.

33:23.602 --> 33:24.803
Oh, Agent Pride.
What happened?

33:24.836 --> 33:26.438
Oh, my God.

33:26.472 --> 33:29.675
Well, the doctors think
that it's her pain meds.

33:29.708 --> 33:31.543
That her IV,
some kind of overdose.

33:31.577 --> 33:32.711
:
I only left for a second.

33:32.744 --> 33:34.746
It's okay, honey.
She's gonna make it.

33:34.780 --> 33:36.248
It's okay.

34:02.741 --> 34:05.577
Nurse said Blake
was in the room with Danielle.

34:05.611 --> 34:07.479
Called the doctor
when she stopped breathing.

34:07.513 --> 34:10.516
Can't we just take him
in for questioning?

34:10.549 --> 34:11.850
Elaine's word against his.

34:11.883 --> 34:14.120
Then we need to talk to her.

34:14.153 --> 34:16.388
Well, she hasn't
turned on him yet.

34:16.422 --> 34:18.124
Hasn't even
asked anybody for help.

34:22.361 --> 34:24.130
Maybe she just needs
a little nudge.

34:25.397 --> 34:27.299
I'm gonna talk to her.

34:27.333 --> 34:28.534
Blake leaves, follow him.

34:32.238 --> 34:34.573
Agent Pride.

34:34.606 --> 34:36.408
Danielle's stable, thank God.

34:36.442 --> 34:38.377
That's good news.

34:38.410 --> 34:39.545
Listen, we, uh...

34:39.578 --> 34:41.380
we need to talk.

34:41.413 --> 34:42.548
Okay, well,

34:42.581 --> 34:44.516
let me just get Blake.
Well, this is

34:44.550 --> 34:46.685
more of a you
and me conversation.

34:48.887 --> 34:51.157
I, uh, I need
to show you something.

34:58.897 --> 35:01.400
Why are you showing me
an X

35:01.433 --> 35:03.569
Because it's
one of the many things

35:03.602 --> 35:05.571
Blake's done to you
over the years.

35:05.604 --> 35:07.739
Oh, no.
This was an accident.

35:07.773 --> 35:10.442
You kept it from Danielle
at first, didn't you?

35:10.476 --> 35:12.578
Want to protect her,
didn't want her to worry.

35:12.611 --> 35:15.414
Accidents,
they're all accidents.

35:15.447 --> 35:18.450
But after the last time
Blake hit you...

35:18.484 --> 35:20.419
I fell.

35:20.452 --> 35:22.854
That's not what you told
Danielle last Monday.

35:22.888 --> 35:25.824
She wanted to get you
away from Blake.

35:25.857 --> 35:27.226
He found out.

35:28.894 --> 35:32.298
He-he tampered with her torch.

35:32.331 --> 35:33.465
Not possible.

35:33.499 --> 35:35.201
I know this must be difficult.

35:35.234 --> 35:37.836
You have no idea.

35:37.869 --> 35:39.238
Blake loves me.

35:39.271 --> 35:41.707
This isn't love.

35:44.643 --> 35:45.811
Please.

35:45.844 --> 35:47.546
If you don't help,

35:47.579 --> 35:49.348
he might try
and hurt Danielle again.

35:51.783 --> 35:54.353
We need you, Elaine.

35:54.386 --> 35:55.587
Danielle needs you.

35:55.621 --> 35:56.855
How?

35:56.888 --> 35:58.524
I can barely help myself,

35:58.557 --> 36:01.159
: how can I possibly
help my daughter?

36:04.796 --> 36:07.466
By being just as strong
as she is.

36:20.946 --> 36:23.582
Hello, Blake.

36:23.615 --> 36:24.816
Elaine.

36:24.850 --> 36:28.387
Sanctuary.

36:28.420 --> 36:31.390
That's what this place
has always meant to me.

36:31.423 --> 36:34.460
Do you remember
when I first brought you here?

36:34.493 --> 36:38.664
Oh, you-you loved looking
at the pictures of my family,

36:38.697 --> 36:41.533
New Orleans.

36:41.567 --> 36:42.701
All the history.

36:43.969 --> 36:46.705
"If these walls could talk..."
you said.

36:50.309 --> 36:52.644
:
If these walls could talk...

36:54.446 --> 36:57.015
Elaine...

36:57.048 --> 36:59.485
What's going on?

36:59.518 --> 37:03.422
Would they tell me why you
would want to hurt Danielle?

37:03.455 --> 37:05.023
What are you talking about?

37:05.056 --> 37:08.494
You asked her to cook
the night of the bombing.

37:08.527 --> 37:09.828
You never wanted her around.

37:09.861 --> 37:12.631
Blake, you encouraged her
to go into the Navy.

37:12.664 --> 37:15.267
It was the best thing
that ever happened to her.

37:15.301 --> 37:16.568
Straightened her life out.

37:16.602 --> 37:17.936
Gave her strength.

37:17.969 --> 37:20.272
The courage to help me
get away from you.

37:21.673 --> 37:23.875
What happened?
How'd you find out?

37:26.011 --> 37:28.614
I overheard her talking to you
about the condo.

37:30.349 --> 37:31.950
She tried to take you
away from me.

37:31.983 --> 37:33.585
So you tried to blow her up?

37:33.619 --> 37:35.721
Wasn't like that.

37:35.754 --> 37:37.489
She just needed to be
taught a lesson.

37:37.523 --> 37:39.057
Like you taught me?

37:39.090 --> 37:40.626
Pushing me, hitting me?

37:40.659 --> 37:42.761
Accidents, Elaine.

37:42.794 --> 37:44.596
Accidents that were your fault.

37:44.630 --> 37:47.399
:
You are a fraud and a monster.

37:47.433 --> 37:48.467
What did you call me?

37:48.500 --> 37:49.735
Step away from her now!

37:49.768 --> 37:50.902
Leave her alone!

37:50.936 --> 37:52.070
SONJA:
Put your hands up.

37:52.103 --> 37:54.005
Get 'em up.

37:54.039 --> 37:56.542
SONJA:
Turn around now.

37:57.943 --> 37:59.511
Double cuffs, King.

38:01.447 --> 38:02.814
You're under arrest

38:02.848 --> 38:04.650
for the attempted murder
of Danielle Jarrett.

38:07.853 --> 38:09.054
Let's go.

38:16.462 --> 38:18.530
You did good.

38:20.799 --> 38:21.967
For yourself.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.536
And for your daughter.

38:25.671 --> 38:28.540
Hm.

38:34.613 --> 38:37.616
Sounds like
everything worked out.

38:37.649 --> 38:39.351
PRIDE:
Best it could.

38:39.385 --> 38:40.552
How about you?

38:40.586 --> 38:41.753
Did you electrocute
yourself again?

38:41.787 --> 38:45.524
No.

38:45.557 --> 38:47.359
I can't do it on my own anymore.

38:47.393 --> 38:49.595
I'm gonna hire
a general manager.

38:49.628 --> 38:50.929
Help me with the bar.

38:50.962 --> 38:53.599
Great. Baby steps, right?

38:53.632 --> 38:54.833
Something like that.

38:54.866 --> 38:56.602
Got your e-mail.

38:56.635 --> 38:58.404
Our suspect in
General Matthews' case

38:58.437 --> 39:00.572
turns out to be another suicide?

39:00.606 --> 39:02.140
Left a note and everything.

39:02.173 --> 39:03.542
Admitted to the leak,

39:03.575 --> 39:05.043
said he did it alone.

39:05.076 --> 39:06.478
Doesn't sound like you buy it.

39:06.512 --> 39:08.480
Do you?

39:08.514 --> 39:10.849
Not really.

39:10.882 --> 39:12.050
Come on back home.

39:12.083 --> 39:13.485
We'll hash it out.

39:13.519 --> 39:14.920
See you soon.

39:16.588 --> 39:17.956
Agent Russo.

39:17.989 --> 39:19.558
Hi.
Hi.

39:19.591 --> 39:21.527
Was hoping you hadn't left.

39:21.560 --> 39:22.894
Wanted to offer you a ride.

39:22.928 --> 39:26.031
Oh, I've got a cab
waiting downstairs.

39:26.064 --> 39:28.033
Send him away. Come with me.

39:28.066 --> 39:29.535
Why would I do that?

39:29.568 --> 39:31.169
Protection.

39:31.202 --> 39:33.605
Oh, God knows the kind
of trouble you can get into

39:33.639 --> 39:34.806
on the way to the airport.

39:34.840 --> 39:36.642
:
Thank you, but I will...

39:36.675 --> 39:38.109
I will take my chances.

39:38.143 --> 39:39.545
Okay.

39:41.747 --> 39:42.914
You have my number.

39:42.948 --> 39:44.883
Yeah.

39:44.916 --> 39:46.117
I do.

39:51.923 --> 39:55.627
* Lord

39:55.661 --> 39:59.531
* My Lord

39:59.565 --> 40:02.901
* I need your
Sounding good.

40:02.934 --> 40:05.604
* Helping hand...
Wow.

40:12.077 --> 40:14.713
Well, looks like somebody's open
for business again.

40:16.147 --> 40:17.683
Still got a little
healing to do,

40:17.716 --> 40:19.751
but with help
from friends like you,

40:19.785 --> 40:21.019
and the Navy,

40:21.052 --> 40:22.454
we're gonna be okay.

40:22.488 --> 40:23.922
I think you're
gonna be okay too.

40:23.955 --> 40:26.692
Thank you for everything,
Agent Pride.

40:26.725 --> 40:28.126
You're welcome.

40:28.159 --> 40:30.128
Let us know if you need
anything, all right?

40:30.161 --> 40:31.730
* That I can't be...

40:31.763 --> 40:33.131
BESH: Hey, Dwayne.
How about helping out

40:33.164 --> 40:34.766
the rest of the team here?
What do you think?

40:34.800 --> 40:37.135
Come on, John. Why are you
piling on me like that?

40:37.168 --> 40:38.169
Come on.
Great to see you.

40:38.203 --> 40:39.170
You too.

40:39.204 --> 40:41.006
Unless you already have
enough on your plate.

40:41.039 --> 40:42.641
No, never too much
for you, Susan.

40:42.674 --> 40:43.809
Always.
All right.

40:43.842 --> 40:44.876
Who else you bring?

40:44.910 --> 40:45.877
Ms. Leah.

40:45.911 --> 40:47.045
How are you?

40:47.078 --> 40:48.480
I'm well, what you got going?

40:48.514 --> 40:49.648
It smells so good.

40:49.681 --> 40:51.483
Red beans and rice,
Woo!

40:51.517 --> 40:52.651
and fried chicken.
Nice.

40:52.684 --> 40:53.919
That is good.
Thank you so much.

40:53.952 --> 40:55.821
Man, we got the best

40:55.854 --> 40:57.789
of the best of the chefs
in New Orleans

40:57.823 --> 40:59.024
cooking for us right here, huh?

40:59.057 --> 41:00.692
Yes, sir, we do.

41:00.726 --> 41:02.794
Hey, Pride, why don't you tell
Percy here how good

41:02.828 --> 41:04.763
deconstructed cuisine is.
Ugh.

41:04.796 --> 41:06.665
Did you say cuisine?
Yeah.

41:06.698 --> 41:08.500
Uh, reconstruct it, okay?

41:08.534 --> 41:10.569
I don't get going
to a restaurant

41:10.602 --> 41:12.203
if they're not gonna
put my food together.

41:12.237 --> 41:13.805
By separating the flavors,

41:13.839 --> 41:16.575
you give the palate
an opportunity...

41:16.608 --> 41:18.810
To enjoy more of the flavors.
That's what I tried to tell her.

41:18.844 --> 41:20.946
PRIDE:
Exactly.
LASALLE:
Thank you, Pride.

41:20.979 --> 41:23.248
We're gonna turn you
into a foodie yet.

41:23.281 --> 41:24.550
