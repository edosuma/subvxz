00:01.258 --> 00:02.652
Jake, hurry up, I'm starving.

00:02.719 --> 00:04.279
Sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:04.346 --> 00:07.715
I just had to grab
my waaaalleeeet...

00:08.324 --> 00:09.673
Gentlemen.

00:46.509 --> 00:47.934
Okay, before we get going,

00:48.001 --> 00:50.884
Sgt. Jeffords has suggested
that it would improve morale

00:50.951 --> 00:52.144
if we started the meeting
with some

00:52.211 --> 00:53.588
consensual
non-work jabber.

00:53.655 --> 00:55.455
I just said it might be nice
if you checked in

00:55.522 --> 00:57.247
on the squad's personal lives
every now and then.

00:57.314 --> 00:58.603
Exactly, jabber.
Scully, go.

00:58.670 --> 01:00.482
Well, it was just
a regular morning for me.

01:00.549 --> 01:03.056
Woke up again
with my dog's butt on my mouth.

01:03.264 --> 01:05.908
This experiment has failed.
Back to work talk.

01:05.975 --> 01:07.439
Peralta, I have a case for you.

01:07.506 --> 01:08.799
Uh, that's a no-can-do, sir.

01:08.866 --> 01:09.937
- Excuse me?
- Oh. Sorry.

01:10.004 --> 01:11.435
I didn't mean to come across
like a rabble rouser.

01:11.502 --> 01:13.341
We're just simply unavail.

01:13.408 --> 01:15.271
We have a meeting
at a new multi-agency,

01:15.338 --> 01:16.454
multi-state task force.

01:16.521 --> 01:18.330
- It's a double multi.
- It's a multi-multi.

01:18.397 --> 01:19.830
You're better at
everything than I am.

01:19.897 --> 01:21.240
- Don't say that.
- It is what it is.

01:21.307 --> 01:22.935
They're taking down
a street racing gang

01:23.002 --> 01:24.323
that's been using
souped-up cars

01:24.390 --> 01:25.997
to transport drugs
across state lines.

01:26.064 --> 01:28.073
It's a real-life
"Fast and the Furious" movie.

01:28.140 --> 01:30.204
Don't those movies
glorify lawlessness?

01:30.271 --> 01:32.166
No. They glorify
family and loyalty

01:32.233 --> 01:33.853
and big, hard boobs
on both men and women.

01:33.920 --> 01:35.533
And guess who's heading up
the task force?

01:35.600 --> 01:36.697
Sgt. Boomer Maxwell!

01:36.764 --> 01:37.757
- Oh!
- Damn!

01:37.824 --> 01:39.831
Boomer Maxwell?
What kind of name is that?

01:39.898 --> 01:42.130
Is he a football player
and/or Rugrat?

01:42.197 --> 01:44.009
Dude,
he's an NYPD legend.

01:44.076 --> 01:46.237
I heard he took down three
serial killers in one week.

01:46.304 --> 01:48.189
I heard he defused a bomb
with his teeth

01:48.256 --> 01:49.456
because his hands were
tied up.

01:49.523 --> 01:51.544
I heard he bangs constantly.

01:51.651 --> 01:53.161
Hitchcock,
no chime-ins for you.

01:53.228 --> 01:55.103
Well, good luck.
I know how competitive

01:55.170 --> 01:56.214
these task forces can be.

01:56.281 --> 01:58.267
Especially this one.
Because Boomer's amazing.

01:58.338 --> 02:00.681
- In bed.
- Come on, Hitchcock!

02:02.324 --> 02:04.952
Oh, hey!
What are you doing down here?

02:05.090 --> 02:07.148
Upstairs bathroom's broken.
I think Scully did it.

02:07.215 --> 02:08.610
He says he hasn't been in
the women's bathroom,

02:08.676 --> 02:10.727
but who else would leave a whole
rotisserie chicken in there?

02:10.794 --> 02:12.208
Did you ask Gina
to submit a work order?

02:12.275 --> 02:13.503
Yes,
but she hasn't done it yet.

02:13.571 --> 02:15.540
She views doing her job
as quote unquote optional.

02:15.607 --> 02:18.749
Well, I'm glad it's broken,
'cause it's nice to see you.

02:18.832 --> 02:20.774
Now, get in that stall
and kill it in there.

02:20.841 --> 02:22.398
- What?
- Sorry. I'm a manager now,

02:22.465 --> 02:23.928
so I'm trying to be
more motivational.

02:23.995 --> 02:25.929
Oh! So it's totally cool
for detectives

02:25.996 --> 02:27.847
to come down here
and take dumps in our bathroom?

02:27.914 --> 02:30.187
Excuse me, Officer,
you need to check your tone.

02:30.254 --> 02:31.539
Sorry, Sarge,
but we're all sick

02:31.606 --> 02:32.930
of detectives
looking down on us.

02:32.997 --> 02:35.352
I bet you don't even know
my name, Rosa Diaz.

02:35.419 --> 02:36.565
Okay, look.

02:36.632 --> 02:38.388
I get that there's
always been tension

02:38.455 --> 02:40.855
between uniformed officers
and detectives,

02:40.922 --> 02:42.773
but Rosa is one
of the good guys.

02:42.840 --> 02:43.969
I'm sure she knows
your name.

02:44.036 --> 02:45.732
You clearly just texted her
the answer.

02:45.799 --> 02:47.364
No, she didn't.
Della Avocado.

02:47.431 --> 02:49.419
- It's Alvarado.
- Stupid auto-correct.

02:49.486 --> 02:50.856
I knew you were still
one of them.

02:50.930 --> 02:52.359
We all knew.

02:53.602 --> 02:54.690
Great.

02:54.758 --> 02:56.016
Now I'm caught in a turf war

02:56.083 --> 02:57.796
between my new squad
and my old squad.

02:57.863 --> 02:59.501
I know this is a big deal
for you as a manager,

02:59.568 --> 03:00.540
but I gotta pee real bad.

03:00.607 --> 03:02.462
Right. Right, right, right.
I believe in you.

03:02.529 --> 03:04.179
Teach that toilet a lesson!

03:04.371 --> 03:05.450
Oh, my God.

03:05.517 --> 03:07.269
These guys are
the best of the best.

03:07.336 --> 03:09.396
- What, are you nervous?
- Yeah! Very. You?

03:09.463 --> 03:10.627
I mean, I was,
but then I looked

03:10.694 --> 03:12.015
at Boomer's personnel file.

03:12.082 --> 03:13.653
We both started
in the same precinct,

03:13.720 --> 03:15.980
we both took down drug gangs
our first year as detectives,

03:16.047 --> 03:18.804
and we've both been referred to
as... El Ganador.

03:18.871 --> 03:20.458
Oh, that's weird.
I've never heard anyone

03:20.525 --> 03:22.079
- calling you that.
- Well, they will soon. The point is,

03:22.146 --> 03:24.084
I'm basically a young
Boomer Maxwell.

03:24.151 --> 03:25.232
Oh, you guys didn't hear?

03:25.299 --> 03:26.592
Boomer's not running
the special unit anymore.

03:26.659 --> 03:27.761
He shattered both his legs

03:27.828 --> 03:29.006
jumping off
the Chrysler Building

03:29.073 --> 03:30.477
onto a passing garbage truck
during a chase.

03:30.544 --> 03:31.662
Damn, that is so cool.

03:31.729 --> 03:33.063
They say
he'll never walk again.

03:33.130 --> 03:34.622
Oh.
Well, that's very sad.

03:34.689 --> 03:37.365
But also still cool.
He's gonna be an Ironside!

03:37.432 --> 03:38.517
Wait,
if Boomer's not doing it,

03:38.584 --> 03:39.655
who's running the task force?

03:39.722 --> 03:41.411
Detective Brett Booth
from 6-3.

03:41.502 --> 03:43.333
Oh!
Cool, cool, cool.

03:43.400 --> 03:44.934
Uh-oh. That was your worried
"cool, cool, cool."

03:45.001 --> 03:47.014
- Who's Brett Booth?
- We were in the academy together.

03:47.081 --> 03:49.223
During a training exercise,
I shot him with a rubber bullet

03:49.290 --> 03:50.717
and somehow it got underneath
his goggles

03:50.784 --> 03:51.802
and hit him in the eye.

03:51.869 --> 03:53.249
It kind of messed up
his depth perception.

03:53.316 --> 03:54.409
Oh, but that was
a long time ago.

03:54.476 --> 03:55.491
I'm sure he's totally fine now

03:55.558 --> 03:58.212
- and he's forgotten all about it.
- Well, well, well.

03:58.279 --> 04:01.013
If it isn't Jake Peralta,
my old...

04:01.884 --> 04:03.012
Rogers!

04:03.080 --> 04:04.238
It happened again!

04:04.305 --> 04:06.139
I told you to keep
the walkways clear!

04:06.206 --> 04:08.325
You're gonna regret this,
Peralta!

04:09.658 --> 04:11.252
Ah!

04:11.618 --> 04:13.714
Stupid Brett Booth
not letting us

04:13.781 --> 04:14.639
on his task force.

04:14.706 --> 04:16.046
Just because you blinded him
in one eye.

04:16.113 --> 04:17.594
His other one works just fine.

04:17.661 --> 04:19.684
No, I mean, the water cooler
thing was pretty bad.

04:19.750 --> 04:20.685
- Yeah, he can't see.
- You know what, screw this.

04:20.753 --> 04:23.708
We don't need a task force
to work the case.

04:23.775 --> 04:25.407
All we have to do is solve it
before Booth is done

04:25.474 --> 04:26.724
with his interviews
in two days.

04:26.791 --> 04:27.964
- That's impossible!
- You know

04:28.031 --> 04:29.850
I hate the word "impossible"
unless it's immediately followed

04:29.917 --> 04:31.202
by the words
"Ghost" and "Protocol."

04:31.269 --> 04:32.698
- Shh.
- <i>Be advised.</i>

04:32.765 --> 04:33.561
<i>We have a shooting
or something</i>

04:33.628 --> 04:35.842
- <i>going on in Brooklyn Heights.</i>
- What's going on?

04:35.909 --> 04:38.294
There's an active shooter
in a hotel in Brooklyn Heights.

04:38.361 --> 04:40.568
<i>Requesting additional units,
squad dispatch.</i>

04:40.663 --> 04:41.948
Multiple casualties.

04:42.015 --> 04:43.928
ESU is en route,
and nearby officers

04:43.995 --> 04:45.294
are responding to the scene
right now.

04:45.362 --> 04:48.000
<i>We have people running.
Advising six or seven shots fired.</i>

04:48.067 --> 04:49.637
<i>Numerous civilians
coming this way.</i>

04:49.818 --> 04:51.759
<i>Warwick, 9238,
show me going.</i>

04:51.826 --> 04:53.488
<i>9238, I have you going.</i>

04:53.555 --> 04:55.550
Hilbert, 9825,
show me going.

04:55.617 --> 04:57.872
<i>- 9825, I have you going.</i>
- What are they saying?

04:57.939 --> 04:59.505
"Show me going"
and their badge number.

04:59.572 --> 05:01.071
They're telling dispatch
that they're close by

05:01.138 --> 05:02.528
and they're responding.

05:03.088 --> 05:05.056
Diaz, 3118, show me going.

05:05.123 --> 05:06.365
Diaz? Rosa Diaz?

05:06.432 --> 05:07.841
That's her badge number.

05:08.688 --> 05:10.255
Rosa's there.

05:15.619 --> 05:16.833
So there's limited
information

05:16.900 --> 05:18.384
about the situation
in Brooklyn Heights,

05:18.451 --> 05:20.661
but I did manage to speak
to a captain at the 9-7,

05:20.728 --> 05:21.595
who offered an update.

05:21.662 --> 05:22.798
Do we know how many shooters?

05:22.865 --> 05:23.948
Two, possibly three.

05:24.015 --> 05:25.665
Again, the situation's
still developing,

05:25.732 --> 05:28.208
but as of now,
there are three dead

05:28.275 --> 05:29.919
and multiple wounded,
all civilians.

05:29.986 --> 05:31.167
So we're going
up there, right?

05:31.234 --> 05:32.886
- To help Rosa?
- ESU is on the scene,

05:32.953 --> 05:34.421
and the 9-7 is locking down
the area.

05:34.488 --> 05:35.620
It's already a zoo.

05:35.687 --> 05:37.130
They wanted us to
remain on alert

05:37.197 --> 05:38.417
but not to respond.

05:38.484 --> 05:39.896
Yeah, but that's
just a suggestion, like

05:39.963 --> 05:41.796
how they tell you to drink
eight cups of water every month.

05:41.863 --> 05:42.937
- A day.
- Sarge, come on.

05:43.004 --> 05:45.948
- This is not the time for jokes.
- No, it wasn't a suggestion.

05:46.015 --> 05:49.060
We've been ordered to go
about our business as usual.

05:49.127 --> 05:50.532
I know you're all concerned
about Rosa,

05:50.599 --> 05:52.095
but she's not going in alone.

05:52.162 --> 05:55.208
She's part of a massive
NYPD response.

05:55.275 --> 05:56.660
And it's Rosa, right?

05:56.727 --> 05:58.394
I mean, she's a badass.

05:58.461 --> 06:00.069
She's the toughest
of all of us.

06:00.136 --> 06:01.150
No offense, guys.

06:01.217 --> 06:02.483
- No, that's accurate.
- Very fair.

06:02.550 --> 06:04.761
- I could take her.
- What? I'm wily.

06:04.828 --> 06:06.634
I promise you,
I will keep you updated

06:06.701 --> 06:07.724
if I learn anything.

06:07.791 --> 06:09.499
In the meantime,
you all have jobs to do.

06:09.566 --> 06:10.791
Dismissed.

06:11.271 --> 06:14.075
Ames.
She's gonna be okay.

06:14.338 --> 06:15.991
I know.

06:16.089 --> 06:17.397
I love you.

06:17.464 --> 06:18.884
Love you too.

06:20.330 --> 06:22.497
Are you done
trying to get into Amy's pants?

06:22.564 --> 06:24.531
- What?
- I'm sorry. I'm freaking out.

06:24.598 --> 06:25.683
Look, I'm worried too,

06:25.750 --> 06:27.144
but spiraling isn't
gonna help anything.

06:27.211 --> 06:28.736
We can't go up there,
so the best thing we can do

06:28.803 --> 06:29.797
is try not to think about it.

06:29.864 --> 06:31.413
- How are supposed to do that?
- Well, it's called

06:31.480 --> 06:33.249
compartmentalizing.
Not to brag, but when you come

06:33.316 --> 06:34.962
from a broken home,
you get pretty good at it.

06:35.029 --> 06:36.661
It's like,
"Hey, whose bra is that

06:36.728 --> 06:38.017
"in the back seat
of my dad's car?

06:38.084 --> 06:39.813
"I'm sure it just blew in there
on accident.

06:39.880 --> 06:41.576
Anyways, off to third grade!"

06:41.643 --> 06:43.077
- I can't.
- I dwell on everything.

06:43.144 --> 06:44.907
I'm a dweller.
I wake up every morning,

06:44.974 --> 06:46.487
I'm worrying about
the Zika virus.

06:46.554 --> 06:48.233
Why is nobody talking
about Zika anymore?

06:48.300 --> 06:49.440
There's no way it fixed!

06:49.507 --> 06:51.717
Okay, look. We'll just ignore
what's going on together.

06:51.867 --> 06:54.003
Okay? Let's focus on the case.

06:54.569 --> 06:57.151
Let's become... street racers.

06:57.710 --> 06:58.948
Okay, Charles.

06:59.054 --> 07:00.163
How do I look?

07:00.230 --> 07:02.362
So cool.
How do I look?

07:02.649 --> 07:04.895
Uh...
you definitely made a choice.

07:05.054 --> 07:06.517
You almost look like...
Speed Racer?

07:06.584 --> 07:08.606
Right?
This is exactly what he wears!

07:08.673 --> 07:10.253
And the best part is...

07:11.007 --> 07:13.610
I can use the kerchief
to start the race!

07:13.677 --> 07:16.807
Well, I wanted this op
to feel normal, and... it does.

07:16.874 --> 07:18.165
This is quintessential Charles.

07:18.243 --> 07:20.359
Okay. Let's go over
the backstories. I can start.

07:20.438 --> 07:22.018
Actually, it's maybe better
for me to go first

07:22.085 --> 07:23.209
so you can make
some internal edits

07:23.276 --> 07:24.324
before you say yours out loud.

07:24.391 --> 07:25.536
- Perfect. After you.
- Great.

07:25.603 --> 07:26.750
My name is Axel Richards.

07:26.817 --> 07:29.149
I've been driving stolen cars
since I was six years old.

07:29.216 --> 07:30.469
- Wow, that's young.
- Oh, yeah.

07:30.536 --> 07:32.515
I had to use a Wiffle Ball bat
to just reach the gas pedal,

07:32.582 --> 07:33.826
and I never learned
to use the brakes.

07:33.893 --> 07:34.703
That sounds so dangerous.

07:34.770 --> 07:35.666
Not if you know
what you're doing.

07:35.733 --> 07:36.635
- Great response.
- Thank you.

07:36.702 --> 07:38.880
Anyways, things went south
when I got addicted to drugs

07:38.947 --> 07:41.281
after my best friend died in
an active shooter situation.

07:41.348 --> 07:42.750
Oh, I see what I did there.

07:43.818 --> 07:45.456
Hey.
What are you doing in here?

07:45.523 --> 07:47.522
Holt's scanner
was making me anxious,

07:47.589 --> 07:50.094
so I came in here to listen
to some calming music.

07:50.184 --> 07:52.190
It's me singing the song
I wrote.

07:52.257 --> 07:54.279
♪ Subway girl ♪

07:54.513 --> 07:57.153
♪ Gettin' all the looks ♪

07:57.220 --> 07:59.678
♪ Holdin' onto your ♪

07:59.745 --> 08:02.766
♪ Big pile of books, yeah ♪

08:03.212 --> 08:05.819
Listen. I was thinking,
Rosa seemed pretty annoyed

08:05.886 --> 08:07.219
about the broken toilet
up here,

08:07.286 --> 08:08.986
and since she's having
a rough day,

08:09.053 --> 08:10.522
I thought it would be nice

08:10.589 --> 08:12.351
if we got it fixed for her
before she got back.

08:12.418 --> 08:13.782
And you came to me
'cause I'm the only one

08:13.849 --> 08:14.819
who ever gets anything done

08:14.886 --> 08:16.431
- around here.
- And because you were supposed

08:16.498 --> 08:17.483
to get it fixed last week,

08:17.550 --> 08:19.027
so it's kind of a
second chance for you.

08:19.094 --> 08:21.197
This is a time of crisis,
so we're supposed to be

08:21.264 --> 08:22.883
lifting each other up.

08:22.987 --> 08:25.973
Why don't you call that plumber
I've been asking you to call

08:26.040 --> 08:27.391
for a few hours now?

08:27.892 --> 08:29.556
<i>All units,
hold your positions.</i>

08:29.623 --> 08:30.670
Any news, Sergeant?

08:30.737 --> 08:32.982
Uh, last I heard,
they've located one shooter,

08:33.049 --> 08:34.264
but they can't get to him.

08:34.331 --> 08:35.754
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't
realize you were on the phone.

08:35.821 --> 08:37.327
Oh, just on hold.
What's up?

08:37.394 --> 08:39.260
I just wanted to check in
to see if you were all right.

08:39.327 --> 08:42.366
I couldn't help but notice that
you've flattened your mouse.

08:42.433 --> 08:44.347
Sorry.
I get crushy when I'm nervous.

08:44.414 --> 08:45.640
If there's anything
you want to talk about,

08:45.707 --> 08:47.117
my door is always open.

08:47.184 --> 08:48.261
Metaphorically.

08:48.328 --> 08:50.435
In reality,
I often keep my door closed,

08:50.502 --> 08:53.006
for privacy, security,
climate control...

08:53.073 --> 08:55.062
You know what, I never even
should've used a metaphor.

08:55.129 --> 08:56.199
I'm better than that.

08:56.266 --> 08:57.667
If there's anything
you want to talk about,

08:57.734 --> 08:59.570
please do so now.

08:59.637 --> 09:00.854
There is.

09:02.107 --> 09:03.668
I'm so scared for Rosa.

09:03.735 --> 09:05.373
And I realized,
I haven't looked at

09:05.440 --> 09:07.703
my life insurance policy
since Ava was born.

09:07.781 --> 09:09.507
I'm on hold with them now.

09:09.574 --> 09:11.261
Terry needs a bulkier plan!

09:11.328 --> 09:12.638
Look, I get
that you're worried

09:12.705 --> 09:14.075
about your own mortality.

09:14.142 --> 09:16.535
Perhaps this fact
will comfort you.

09:16.602 --> 09:18.761
As an NYPD officer,
you're more likely to be

09:18.828 --> 09:21.504
crushed by scaffolding
than to die on the job.

09:21.571 --> 09:22.715
Oh, God.

09:22.953 --> 09:24.535
This is a city of scaffolding!

09:24.602 --> 09:26.414
No, no, Sergeant,
I was only trying to point out

09:26.481 --> 09:28.682
that there are millions
of potential ways to die.

09:28.749 --> 09:30.190
Do you know how common
choking is?

09:30.257 --> 09:31.751
What are you doing, man?

09:31.818 --> 09:33.418
Yeah, so this won't be
a problem.

09:33.485 --> 09:34.773
I can pencil you in tomorrow.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.901
Oh. Uh, we kind of need you
to fix it

09:36.968 --> 09:38.660
before our friend
gets back today.

09:38.727 --> 09:40.111
I'm sorry,
it's gonna take a while,

09:40.178 --> 09:41.227
and I have other appointments.

09:41.294 --> 09:42.340
Well, can you cancel them?

09:42.407 --> 09:44.394
I didn't want to do this,
but our friend is a cop,

09:44.461 --> 09:46.062
and she's caught in a Brooklyn
Heights shooting right now.

09:46.129 --> 09:47.127
Oh!

09:47.195 --> 09:48.304
So you think
you're the first people

09:48.371 --> 09:49.740
that ever needed a toilet fixed

09:49.811 --> 09:51.581
'cause a loved one's life
was in danger.

09:51.648 --> 09:52.623
Yes?

09:52.691 --> 09:54.658
You're not.
Welcome to New York.

09:56.210 --> 09:58.987
That's a grim commentary
on the city we live in.

09:59.054 --> 10:02.158
Refresh. No news.
Refresh. No news.

10:02.225 --> 10:03.265
Why is there no news?

10:03.332 --> 10:05.358
Charles, come on.
Compartmentalize, remember?

10:05.425 --> 10:07.476
Try and think happy thoughts
like the Shrek musical.

10:07.543 --> 10:09.206
Come on, Jake,
you know they shut that down.

10:09.273 --> 10:11.468
The health board said there was
too much mud on the stage!

10:11.535 --> 10:12.745
Yeah, probably for the best.
All right, that didn't work.

10:12.812 --> 10:14.655
How about this?
Let's clean up our desks.

10:14.722 --> 10:16.346
Right? That's always good
for a distraction.

10:16.413 --> 10:19.775
Oh, no.
Rosa gave me this notepad.

10:19.901 --> 10:21.860
I remember I was all,
"Anyone got a notepad?"

10:21.927 --> 10:23.073
And she said, "Yep, here."

10:23.140 --> 10:24.878
- Oh, my God, that's so Rosa.
- I know.

10:24.945 --> 10:27.288
Okay. So, before you can
change a policy,

10:27.355 --> 10:29.044
I'm gonna have to ask you
a few medical questions,

10:29.111 --> 10:29.940
check your vitals.

10:30.007 --> 10:31.544
Great. Just do it fast.

10:31.611 --> 10:33.030
Terry knows
tomorrow's not promised.

10:33.097 --> 10:35.551
Okay. Then let's start
with your blood pressure.

10:35.618 --> 10:36.859
We can skip this part.

10:36.955 --> 10:38.913
I always clock in
at 130 over 80.

10:38.980 --> 10:40.073
Terry's in tiptop.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.671
Shots fired.
Shots fired!

10:41.738 --> 10:43.124
- What?
- Is anybody hurt?

10:43.191 --> 10:44.394
- I don't know.
- Oh, man.

10:44.461 --> 10:47.681
And your BP's at 290.
Oh, 350.

10:48.013 --> 10:50.548
- You broke the machine.
- All right, screw this.

10:50.746 --> 10:51.944
There were shots fired.

10:52.011 --> 10:53.690
I just got off the phone.
There are two officers down.

10:53.757 --> 10:54.946
Neither one of them is Diaz.

10:55.013 --> 10:56.668
What, are we supposed to
wait until one is?

10:56.735 --> 10:58.604
Sir, we have to go up there.
We have to help Rosa.

10:58.671 --> 11:00.557
ESU has more than
enough manpower,

11:00.624 --> 11:03.069
and we have been ordered
to stay in this precinct

11:03.136 --> 11:04.098
by the commissioner.

11:04.165 --> 11:06.017
So what?
He's not a part of our squad.

11:06.084 --> 11:06.987
He doesn't care about her.

11:07.054 --> 11:10.243
Look, I know you're concerned
about Diaz, as am I.

11:10.310 --> 11:14.074
Nevertheless, I am ordering you
to stay in this precinct.

11:14.141 --> 11:15.365
Fine.

11:16.045 --> 11:18.470
I understand that's your order.

11:21.550 --> 11:22.753
- What'd he say?
- Doesn't matter.

11:22.820 --> 11:24.548
I'm gonna go help Rosa.

11:29.007 --> 11:30.903
Okay, I'm going up to
the scene of the shooting,

11:30.970 --> 11:31.991
and I need your help.

11:32.058 --> 11:33.945
I can't sign tactical gear
out of the armory

11:34.012 --> 11:35.867
without Holt's approval.
That's our mission objective.

11:35.934 --> 11:38.083
First things first.
Let's synchronize our watches.

11:38.150 --> 11:40.533
- These don't work.
- They're just status symbols.

11:40.600 --> 11:41.630
Okay, we'll use our phones,

11:41.697 --> 11:43.028
which are connected
to the internet.

11:43.095 --> 11:45.658
I don't get the internet
with my Netscape Blip.

11:45.725 --> 11:47.200
Let's just use
the regular clocks.

11:47.267 --> 11:48.901
At 3:34,
I'll go into the armory

11:48.968 --> 11:50.714
and hand the officer in charge
a list of items.

11:50.781 --> 11:53.236
Then, at 3:35, you two
will cause a distraction

11:53.311 --> 11:54.819
that draws Holt
into the bullpen.

11:54.886 --> 11:56.339
When Holt's not looking,
I'll sneak into the office

11:56.406 --> 11:58.099
and answer the phone
when the armory calls

11:58.166 --> 11:59.202
asking for approval,

11:59.269 --> 12:01.473
fooling them with my
spot-on Holt impression.

12:01.540 --> 12:02.890
"I'm Captain Holt."

12:02.957 --> 12:04.061
Yeah, I don't know,
something feels off.

12:04.128 --> 12:06.057
He sounds too white.
Here's how you do it.

12:06.124 --> 12:08.151
No, no, that's okay!
Luckily I have a backup plan.

12:08.218 --> 12:10.643
I got the Holt soundboard app
from Gina.

12:10.710 --> 12:13.033
I'm. Raymond. Holt.

12:13.272 --> 12:15.891
Get. Some.
Get. Some.

12:16.014 --> 12:17.876
Man, soundboard Holt
is so horny.

12:17.943 --> 12:20.132
Anyways, Hitchock and Scully,
to distract the captain,

12:20.199 --> 12:21.589
I'm gonna need you
to get in a fight.

12:21.656 --> 12:24.376
- Us? The buddies?
- How would that even work?

12:24.443 --> 12:25.971
You guys are adorable.
But we don't have time

12:26.038 --> 12:27.525
for this, so figure it out!

12:27.973 --> 12:30.087
Okay, so that plumber
was useless.

12:30.240 --> 12:32.989
But we are two smart
and capable people

12:33.056 --> 12:35.267
who can definitely figure out
how to fix a toilet.

12:35.334 --> 12:36.577
Of course we can.

12:36.644 --> 12:38.075
The internet will tell us
what to do.

12:38.142 --> 12:39.089
She always does.

12:39.156 --> 12:40.154
Yes!

12:40.222 --> 12:42.143
I'll just search
"toilet videos."

12:42.373 --> 12:44.197
Oh! So much porn!

12:44.264 --> 12:45.768
Probably should've been
more specific.

12:45.835 --> 12:49.701
"Person fixing broken toilet."
More porn.

12:49.768 --> 12:51.623
How about this?
"Instructional video

12:51.690 --> 12:55.572
from a plumber on how to fix
an actual toilet."

12:55.779 --> 12:57.986
Still porn!
How is that still porn?

12:58.053 --> 12:59.996
Okay, you know what,
this isn't rocket science.

13:00.063 --> 13:01.667
All right?
The first thing we gotta do,

13:01.734 --> 13:03.212
shut off the water supply.

13:05.014 --> 13:07.682
Did I do that?

13:08.769 --> 13:11.381
That's an Urkel reference,
from the show "Family Matters."

13:11.448 --> 13:12.900
Do you remember that?

13:14.967 --> 13:16.996
Hey, there.
I want to check out some gear.

13:17.063 --> 13:18.132
All right.

13:24.927 --> 13:26.323
Okay. Get ready.

13:26.390 --> 13:28.542
- It's showtime.
- What?

13:28.677 --> 13:31.250
Hmm? Oh, I just said...
I have Showtime.

13:31.317 --> 13:32.332
The cable channel.

13:32.399 --> 13:34.047
Mm. Must be nice.

13:34.114 --> 13:36.400
Scully and Hitchcock are just
looking at each other.

13:36.467 --> 13:37.800
I'm a little worried
they're not gonna be able...

13:37.867 --> 13:40.826
You son of a bitch!

13:42.212 --> 13:43.829
Okay, we're a go.

13:45.824 --> 13:48.760
- Ah!
- Ooh!

13:48.827 --> 13:51.453
Oh, my God, they're in
a penis punch 69!

13:51.520 --> 13:52.847
- Ooh!
- Ah!

13:53.008 --> 13:54.709
Hey, hey, hey!

13:57.969 --> 13:59.427
What's going on?
Why are you fighting?

13:59.494 --> 14:00.880
Well, he punched me
in the nuts,

14:00.947 --> 14:02.316
so I punched him in the nuts,

14:02.383 --> 14:03.557
so he punched me in the nuts,

14:03.624 --> 14:04.887
so I punched him in the nuts.

14:04.954 --> 14:07.173
But why?
You still haven't told me why.

14:07.313 --> 14:09.691
- Um...
- Um...

14:10.188 --> 14:11.969
Ooh!

14:12.241 --> 14:15.011
Okay. I just need to get
Holt's approval.

14:15.078 --> 14:16.203
Go for it.

14:18.336 --> 14:20.355
- This. Is. Holt.
- Hey.

14:20.422 --> 14:21.539
It's Officer Wilg
at the armory.

14:21.606 --> 14:22.650
I got Peralta here.

14:22.717 --> 14:24.414
He's signing out body armor
and a long gun.

14:24.481 --> 14:25.500
Is he all clear?

14:25.567 --> 14:27.286
Yes. Approved.

14:27.424 --> 14:28.644
Thanks.
Oh, hey, Raymond.

14:28.711 --> 14:31.115
Can't wait for you and Kevin
to come over and meet the baby.

14:31.182 --> 14:33.053
We still on for Thursday,
right?

14:34.385 --> 14:35.865
Screw. That.

14:36.135 --> 14:38.536
I'm sorry, I thought you
wanted to meet baby Carol.

14:38.627 --> 14:40.036
Her surgery was such a success.

14:40.119 --> 14:42.279
Screw. That.
Screw. That.

14:42.346 --> 14:44.661
Get. Some.
Good. Bye.

14:44.792 --> 14:45.941
Ah. What a weirdo.

14:46.008 --> 14:47.638
Anyways, thanks for the gun.

14:49.088 --> 14:50.465
Okay.

14:50.533 --> 14:51.908
That should work.

14:52.049 --> 14:54.372
The hose thing was disconnected
from the pipe thing,

14:54.439 --> 14:56.360
so the tub thing
wasn't filling.

14:56.427 --> 15:00.107
Now we can just
turn this back on.

15:00.226 --> 15:02.208
And test it.

15:02.275 --> 15:03.921
Wait, first,
let's say a prayer.

15:03.988 --> 15:06.767
Dear Beyoncé, Solange, Rihanna,

15:06.834 --> 15:08.368
someone cool that's white,

15:08.435 --> 15:10.911
Cardi B,
please bless this flush.

15:11.002 --> 15:12.924
A-woman.

15:14.783 --> 15:15.971
Okay.

15:16.656 --> 15:17.615
Ah! It works.

15:17.717 --> 15:19.213
We did it!

15:19.281 --> 15:20.794
Uh, what's that weird noise?

15:22.225 --> 15:23.253
It doesn't sound good.

15:23.320 --> 15:24.535
No, no, no.
It sounds fine.

15:24.602 --> 15:26.526
That's totally normal.
We fixed it.

15:31.560 --> 15:33.213
Oh, damn.

15:38.069 --> 15:39.675
- Gah!
- Going somewhere?

15:39.742 --> 15:40.872
Fine, yes, you got me.

15:40.939 --> 15:42.231
So how'd you know
I was sneaking out?

15:42.298 --> 15:44.708
I got a couple of very angry
texts from Officer Wilg

15:44.775 --> 15:47.618
accusing me of quote unquote
hating my own goddaughter.

15:47.685 --> 15:49.802
How close are you
with Colin from the armory?

15:49.869 --> 15:51.486
Let's focus
on the real question.

15:51.553 --> 15:54.084
Why are you disobeying an order
from the commissioner?

15:54.195 --> 15:55.821
I'm clearly
the good guy here.

15:55.888 --> 15:57.719
All right? If this was a movie,
no one would be on your side.

15:57.786 --> 15:59.069
You're basically the guy
in "Ghostbusters"

15:59.136 --> 16:00.316
who lets all the ghosts out.

16:00.383 --> 16:01.421
There's no such thing
as ghosts.

16:01.488 --> 16:03.011
Exactly.
Now, if you'll excuse me,

16:03.078 --> 16:04.120
I'm gonna go help Rosa.

16:04.187 --> 16:06.073
How?
This isn't a movie.

16:06.181 --> 16:08.175
You're not gonna rush
onto the scene

16:08.242 --> 16:09.825
and singlehandedly take down
all the bad guys.

16:09.892 --> 16:11.102
I might.
My gun is pretty big.

16:11.169 --> 16:12.241
It barely fits in the car.

16:12.308 --> 16:13.339
Want to be a hero?

16:13.406 --> 16:15.130
You want to actually
get something done?

16:15.265 --> 16:16.801
Your friends and colleagues
right here

16:16.868 --> 16:18.098
are struggling,
and they need you.

16:18.165 --> 16:20.188
I did everything I could.
I tried to distract me

16:20.255 --> 16:22.104
and Charles all day long,
and it didn't work.

16:22.171 --> 16:23.333
They don't need to
be distracted.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.327
They need someone to help them
face their fears

16:25.394 --> 16:27.524
and deal with the reality
of the situation.

16:27.591 --> 16:29.311
Okay, great.
So why don't you do it?

16:29.378 --> 16:30.966
I tried, but it didn't work.

16:31.033 --> 16:33.046
I'm not particularly skilled
at emotional jabber.

16:33.113 --> 16:34.441
I was hoping you would step up.

16:34.508 --> 16:36.530
And I was hoping to actually
do something valuable

16:36.597 --> 16:37.839
like help Rosa.

16:38.170 --> 16:40.370
So are you gonna stand
in my way or not?

16:53.457 --> 16:55.652
Okay, I think I got it.

16:55.719 --> 16:57.749
Just have to tighten this here,

16:57.816 --> 16:59.663
and here we go.

16:59.730 --> 17:01.317
Please work.

17:02.517 --> 17:04.391
Come on.

17:05.098 --> 17:06.795
Come on!

17:08.057 --> 17:11.278
Flush, you stupid
son of a bitch!

17:11.346 --> 17:12.465
Ah!

17:18.311 --> 17:21.580
Wow.
Bitches really do be crazy.

17:21.647 --> 17:23.464
Sorry.
We should just give up.

17:23.531 --> 17:24.859
This was such a dumb idea.

17:24.926 --> 17:26.512
Yeah, it would only matter
if we actually thought

17:26.579 --> 17:28.362
Rosa was coming home today.

17:29.077 --> 17:31.065
- We should keep going, right?
- Definitely.

17:31.202 --> 17:34.979
Also, it's fun to watch you
get destroyed by a toilet.

17:36.375 --> 17:37.812
Hello?

17:38.983 --> 17:40.921
You know what, I'm trying
to keep this line open,

17:40.988 --> 17:43.304
so I don't have time
for your bull crap.

17:43.371 --> 17:44.972
Good-bye, Mom.

17:45.937 --> 17:47.835
I'm so sorry,
how's your penis?

17:47.902 --> 17:49.366
Sore.
How's your penis?

17:49.433 --> 17:52.401
- Sore.
- I'm proud of us.

17:54.682 --> 17:57.605
- Still too high.
- Okay. What if I cut myself?

17:57.672 --> 17:58.948
Just to let
some of the blood out?

17:59.015 --> 18:00.405
I'm sorry,
but I can't stay here all day.

18:00.472 --> 18:01.498
I have other things to do.

18:01.565 --> 18:04.714
You a traveling nurse, man.
Don't big-time me.

18:04.819 --> 18:07.194
I'm sorry.
Look, it's been a tough day.

18:07.261 --> 18:09.081
Hey, everyone, I got pizza.

18:09.218 --> 18:10.995
Grab a slice.

18:11.100 --> 18:12.602
Probably gonna be
a really long night,

18:12.669 --> 18:13.778
and none of you
have eaten anything.

18:13.845 --> 18:15.698
Peralta,
why are you back so soon?

18:15.765 --> 18:17.386
Because I wanted
to do something.

18:18.562 --> 18:20.628
Hey, guys.
How're you holding up?

18:20.695 --> 18:22.448
I mean, not great, but I know

18:22.515 --> 18:23.741
you really don't want
to talk about it.

18:23.808 --> 18:26.190
No.
We should talk about it.

18:26.672 --> 18:29.089
- I'm really scared for Rosa.
- Me too.

18:29.156 --> 18:31.046
And it keeps making me
think about my kids.

18:31.113 --> 18:32.636
How do I deal with the fact

18:32.703 --> 18:33.882
that every day
I leave for work,

18:33.949 --> 18:35.056
I might not come home?

18:35.123 --> 18:36.120
Man, I don't even know,
Terry.

18:36.187 --> 18:39.222
I don't have kids yet,
but I know you love them.

18:39.476 --> 18:42.659
And I feel like that's all you
can really do, right?

18:42.945 --> 18:44.351
I mean, now that
I'm getting married,

18:44.418 --> 18:45.847
I keep thinking if something
happens to me,

18:45.914 --> 18:47.413
it'll actually affect
someone else.

18:47.582 --> 18:49.947
I'd get over it eventually,
after a lot of therapy.

18:50.027 --> 18:53.031
I was more talking about Amy,
but yes, you too, Charles.

18:57.419 --> 18:58.816
Hey, look at that.

18:58.883 --> 19:00.091
130 over 80.

19:00.158 --> 19:01.356
Back to normal.

19:01.423 --> 19:02.620
I can get out of your hair now.

19:02.687 --> 19:04.090
Nice.

19:04.347 --> 19:05.890
Told you, Andrew.

19:06.097 --> 19:07.789
Terry's in tiptop.

19:09.041 --> 19:10.585
Thanks, Jake.

19:11.695 --> 19:13.794
Captain.
I know you don't eat pizza,

19:13.861 --> 19:16.131
but I figured you'd want
to be included.

19:16.230 --> 19:18.322
Uh, thank you.

19:18.456 --> 19:20.745
You know what would make
a great movie?

19:20.833 --> 19:22.357
One where the hero
sits with his friends

19:22.424 --> 19:23.747
and they talk
about their emotions.

19:23.814 --> 19:25.256
I know that you're just
being nice right now,

19:25.323 --> 19:26.570
but that would be
a terrible movie.

19:26.637 --> 19:27.769
I mean,
what would the poster even be?

19:27.836 --> 19:29.097
Just a bunch of people's faces?

19:29.164 --> 19:30.429
Guys.
Guys, guys, guys.

19:30.496 --> 19:32.056
They just took both shooters
into custody.

19:32.123 --> 19:33.683
Officers got injured
in the action.

19:33.750 --> 19:34.610
They don't say how many.

19:34.677 --> 19:36.722
Call Diaz.
Get her cell.

19:37.218 --> 19:38.520
Damn it.

19:38.613 --> 19:40.421
It's still just going
to voice mail.

19:44.859 --> 19:46.859
Okay. I don't have the names
of the injured officers,

19:46.926 --> 19:48.176
but if Diaz is unharmed,

19:48.243 --> 19:49.791
she should be
contacting us shortly.

19:49.858 --> 19:51.215
Or, if her phone is dead,

19:51.282 --> 19:53.764
perhaps she'll be walking out
the elevator at any moment.

19:56.995 --> 19:58.324
Come on, Scully!

19:58.391 --> 19:59.789
You can't be doing stuff
like that, man!

19:59.856 --> 20:01.543
I was just making
a copy downstairs.

20:01.610 --> 20:02.981
Yeah, well, next time, think.

20:03.048 --> 20:04.320
- About what?
- I don't know!

20:04.387 --> 20:06.381
- Okay, Jake.
- Come on, man. Go easy on him.

20:06.481 --> 20:07.840
- Diaz!
- Rosa!

20:07.907 --> 20:08.992
You're okay!
Where'd you come from?

20:09.059 --> 20:10.450
Felt like walking,
so I took the stairs.

20:10.517 --> 20:12.227
Also, I thought it'd be funny
to mess with you guys.

20:12.294 --> 20:13.641
Rosa, you know I hate pranks.

20:13.708 --> 20:15.686
- You love pranks.
- I do. I really do.

20:16.065 --> 20:18.147
You did it so good.

20:19.628 --> 20:21.102
Were you guys worried
about me or something?

20:21.169 --> 20:22.191
No.

20:22.266 --> 20:24.012
So what happened?
Did they shoot at you?

20:24.079 --> 20:25.058
Were you in the thick of it?

20:25.125 --> 20:26.867
It's been a really tough day.
I just want to get a beer.

20:26.934 --> 20:27.992
I don't feel like
getting into it.

20:28.059 --> 20:29.139
Are you sure?
Because the journey

20:29.206 --> 20:30.067
I went on today taught me

20:30.134 --> 20:31.511
that sometimes it's best
to talk about things...

20:31.578 --> 20:32.752
- Jake.
- Right. It was a stupid idea.

20:32.819 --> 20:34.168
And Holt told me to do it, so.

20:34.235 --> 20:35.747
Let's just go get a drink
and sit in total silence.

20:35.814 --> 20:37.094
Perfect.
First, I gotta go to the can.

20:37.161 --> 20:38.852
Actually,
you might want to check out

20:38.919 --> 20:40.102
the ladies' room up here.

20:40.169 --> 20:42.148
Hey, Rosa, it's me,
Gina Linetti.

20:42.215 --> 20:43.309
Welcome back.

20:43.376 --> 20:45.234
Me and Amy made
a little surprise for you,

20:45.301 --> 20:48.295
and I think you're gonna
like it very, very much.

20:48.466 --> 20:49.967
Come on, girl.

20:50.327 --> 20:52.152
Ta-da!

20:52.220 --> 20:53.711
You made it sound like
you fixed the toilet.

20:53.778 --> 20:55.506
Yeah, I thought
maybe Amy would've

20:55.573 --> 20:57.348
pulled something together
in the two minutes

20:57.415 --> 20:58.606
I stepped outside.

20:58.673 --> 21:01.561
Hey, Tina! Look what I stole
from the Barnes and...

21:02.080 --> 21:04.856
Oh, my God, Rosa!
I'm so happy to see you!

21:04.923 --> 21:06.474
Wait, are you covered
in toilet water?

21:06.576 --> 21:08.843
Yes, big-time.
But this is happening.

21:08.910 --> 21:10.384
Ugh. Fine.

21:10.870 --> 21:12.414
I feel like I'm lurking.

21:12.481 --> 21:13.570
Gina, get in here.

21:13.637 --> 21:14.845
Yay!

21:17.421 --> 21:19.517
Not a doctor.
Shh.
