00:00.620 --> 00:02.790
Previously on "Manifest"...

00:02.790 --> 00:03.670
Grace: Stop!

00:03.670 --> 00:04.580
What just happened?

00:04.580 --> 00:06.000
I just h-heard my own voice.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.710
You just had a Calling.

00:07.710 --> 00:09.800
Not all answers
can be found in books.

00:09.800 --> 00:11.170
Here.

00:11.170 --> 00:13.220
We shouldn't be talking
to believers.

00:13.220 --> 00:15.800
It went sideways even before
the plane disappeared.

00:15.800 --> 00:18.220
The person I was
supposed to go with...

00:18.220 --> 00:20.060
Just didn't work out.

00:20.060 --> 00:21.640
Right. 8B.

00:21.640 --> 00:23.190
The seat beside you was empty.

00:23.190 --> 00:26.650
How the hell does the Major know
about Saanvi's discovery?

00:26.650 --> 00:28.770
Saanvi: I had a new realization
about the Callings,

00:28.770 --> 00:30.650
that they might be
transferable genetically.

00:30.650 --> 00:32.030
It is really exciting.

00:32.030 --> 00:33.240
Ben Stone?

00:33.240 --> 00:35.240
Suzanne?
I'm a dean.

00:35.240 --> 00:37.410
I'm on a job hunt, so
if you hear of anything --

00:37.410 --> 00:39.660
Send me your C.V. today.

00:39.660 --> 00:41.080
You need me to have
your back around here.

00:41.080 --> 00:42.660
Actually, I think I just need
you to let this go.

00:42.660 --> 00:44.040
Maybe it's for the best --
clean break.

00:44.040 --> 00:45.670
Cal:
We have to talk to Zeke.

00:45.670 --> 00:46.790
Well, once he's out on bail,
we can talk to him.

00:46.790 --> 00:48.670
We have to save him,
just like we have

00:48.670 --> 00:50.300
to save the rest
of the passengers.

00:50.300 --> 00:51.630
As to the count of assault
in the first degree,

00:51.630 --> 00:52.970
I plead guilty.

00:52.970 --> 00:54.470
Zeke, stop.
No, you can fight this.

00:54.470 --> 00:55.720
I plead guilty.

01:07.810 --> 01:09.650
Hi. Where are you?

01:09.650 --> 01:13.110
You're, uh -- You're making me
really nervous, babe.

01:13.110 --> 01:15.070
Okay, I had a really exciting
breakthrough today,

01:15.070 --> 01:19.870
and I'm dying to tell you about
it, so just please hurry, okay?

01:19.870 --> 01:21.290
Bye.

01:21.290 --> 01:22.500
Oh. Excuse me.

01:22.500 --> 01:25.080
Oh.
Ooh. Oh.

01:25.080 --> 01:26.580
Excuse me.

01:28.420 --> 01:30.920
Well, well, well,
Jamaica, here we come!

01:30.920 --> 01:32.090
It's our honeymoon.

01:32.090 --> 01:34.300
Congrats.
Thanks.

01:34.300 --> 01:36.090
Flight attendant:
Hold the door.

01:36.090 --> 01:37.010
One more coming.

01:37.010 --> 01:38.890
Come on, baby. Come on.

01:40.510 --> 01:42.680
Come on, come on.

01:42.680 --> 01:44.680
There's your seat.

02:00.010 --> 02:02.130
Woman on P.A.:
Welcome to Flight 727.

02:02.130 --> 02:03.400
Oh, hey.

02:03.400 --> 02:03.800
Nonstop service from JFK
to Montego Bay, Jamaica.
Oh, hey.

02:03.800 --> 02:05.200
Nonstop service from JFK
to Montego Bay, Jamaica.

02:05.200 --> 02:06.660
Um, do you mind
if my hubby sits here?
No.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.620
Flight attendants,
prepare for takeoff.

02:08.620 --> 02:10.080
Looks like sun and...

02:10.080 --> 02:11.870
Saanvi: Something in me
died that day,

02:11.870 --> 02:13.580
and it still hurts.

02:19.090 --> 02:21.680
When we came back,

02:21.680 --> 02:24.060
I thought...

02:24.060 --> 02:28.480
Alex might be there.

02:28.480 --> 02:30.400
I mean,
it was all over the news.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.980
Have you thought about
what you'd say to Alex?

02:32.980 --> 02:35.860
There's an e-mail in my drafts
folder I keep rewriting.

02:35.860 --> 02:37.070
Why haven't you sent it?

02:37.070 --> 02:38.650
I don't know.

02:38.650 --> 02:41.660
I'm still so angry.

02:41.660 --> 02:43.240
And I'm hurt.

02:43.240 --> 02:45.290
And I'm in love.

02:47.250 --> 02:49.080
I can never find
the right words.

02:49.080 --> 02:52.250
Saanvi,
you wrote the e-mail.

02:52.250 --> 02:53.630
Send it.

02:53.630 --> 02:56.460
You need completion
so you can finally move on.

02:56.460 --> 02:59.470
Yeah, you're probably right.

02:59.470 --> 03:01.090
Maybe I will.

03:01.090 --> 03:03.260
So, that was your thorn.

03:03.260 --> 03:05.100
What about your rose?

03:05.100 --> 03:07.680
Work's good.
I mean, I'm exhausted.

03:07.680 --> 03:09.100
Why is that?

03:09.100 --> 03:11.480
Just in a hurry to prove
that I'm right,

03:11.480 --> 03:14.480
you know, that we were
all genetically changed

03:14.480 --> 03:17.110
on that plane.

03:17.110 --> 03:20.610
I've been running
a DNA sequencer 24/7.

03:20.610 --> 03:24.030
It's like a needle in a
haystack, but I know it's there.

03:24.030 --> 03:26.660
I admire your perseverance,
Saanvi.

03:26.660 --> 03:29.830
Truly remarkable.

03:29.830 --> 03:31.620
-Hey.
-Hey.
-Hey.

03:31.620 --> 03:33.460
Who died?

03:33.460 --> 03:36.090
He's got
another job interview.
Oh!

03:36.090 --> 03:37.710
It's the same job
I've been chasing,

03:37.710 --> 03:40.090
an adjunct professor
at Astoria.

03:40.090 --> 03:42.380
There's just been a lot
of hoops to jump through.
Okay.

03:42.380 --> 03:44.260
Which he has been doing
with flying colors.

03:44.260 --> 03:47.850
So far. They're having me
guest-lecture on Combinatorics.

03:47.850 --> 03:50.140
I don't get it. You were on
a tenure track before.

03:50.140 --> 03:52.310
Yeah, well,
now I can't get on any track.

03:52.310 --> 03:54.350
Soon as they hear
I'm a passenger,

03:54.350 --> 03:56.150
I might as well have
the plague.
Mm.

03:56.150 --> 03:57.730
Only reason I got this chance

03:57.730 --> 03:59.570
is because I ran into
an old colleague.
Mm.

03:59.570 --> 04:01.530
She was a little more
than an old colleague.

04:04.110 --> 04:05.740
Love you.

04:05.740 --> 04:06.950
See you later.

04:08.910 --> 04:11.370
Okay, I need coffee.

04:11.370 --> 04:12.500
Oh, yeah, here you go.

04:12.500 --> 04:15.790
Wow, why'd you d--
Loving the hair.

04:15.790 --> 04:17.920
Sort of.

04:17.920 --> 04:19.550
Thanks.

04:19.550 --> 04:20.670
I love it, too.

04:20.670 --> 04:22.300
See you after school.

04:24.300 --> 04:26.340
Oh, come on, she looks cute.

04:26.340 --> 04:28.970
I mean, I had a buzz cut
and a nose ring at that age.

04:28.970 --> 04:31.100
Oh, I remember,
and it was disturbing.

04:31.100 --> 04:32.680
No, it...

04:32.680 --> 04:35.690
So, what, did you just stop by
to throw shade?

04:35.690 --> 04:38.480
I don't know. Being here
makes me feel less alone.

04:38.480 --> 04:40.320
What's the word on Saanvi?

04:40.320 --> 04:43.400
Vance has been surveilling her
around the clock, but nothing.

04:43.400 --> 04:45.320
She still doesn't know
she has a leak?

04:45.320 --> 04:47.990
Vance says it's too risky.

04:47.990 --> 04:50.120
Still, I hate lying to her.

04:50.120 --> 04:52.200
Ben, you got to detach.

04:52.200 --> 04:53.830
Oh.

04:53.830 --> 04:55.790
Like you're doing with Zeke.

04:58.250 --> 05:01.250
Okay, fine.
Yes, I'm attached.

05:01.250 --> 05:02.590
Have you talked to him?

05:03.550 --> 05:05.380
Um, no, buddy, not yet,

05:05.380 --> 05:07.970
but I've got some ideas.
-Hey.

05:07.970 --> 05:08.970
Guess who's riding shotgun.

05:08.970 --> 05:10.640
Yes!

05:14.230 --> 05:15.770
Give this to Zeke
when you see him.

05:25.490 --> 05:30.280
To be wiped from the face
of the Earth, only to return

05:30.280 --> 05:33.370
is an undeniable message
to the world.

05:33.370 --> 05:39.460
Hope, faith, belief --
all shall be rewarded.

05:39.460 --> 05:42.630
The miracle of 828
was for all.

05:42.630 --> 05:45.470
Now, those who feel called
to testify are welcome.

05:53.220 --> 05:54.430
Thanks.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.020
I'm Maxine.

06:00.020 --> 06:02.270
Together: Hi, Maxine.

06:02.270 --> 06:04.280
Maxine: I'm a Believer.

06:04.280 --> 06:07.200
I was pretty broken
when I first came here.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.450
Yeah, I'm not gonna lie.

06:08.450 --> 06:09.610
My parents, they just --

06:09.610 --> 06:13.580
they didn't get me,
and I was lost.

06:13.580 --> 06:19.500
But then I heard Adrian talk
about how we're all connected,

06:19.500 --> 06:24.340
about how we're all a part
of the miracle of 828.

06:24.340 --> 06:28.260
And Adrian says if you accept
that miracle,

06:28.260 --> 06:31.140
we'll all be saved.

06:31.140 --> 06:35.470
Well, it's already saved
my life.

06:35.470 --> 06:36.930
I believe.
Man: Yes.

06:48.610 --> 06:50.660
I have to get him
out of there.

06:50.660 --> 06:52.740
Decorated cop versus ex-con

06:52.740 --> 06:54.660
carrying an illegally
purchased firearm.

06:54.660 --> 06:55.870
He was trying
to protect --

06:55.870 --> 06:57.370
Guy goes on the run for,
what, 62 days?

06:57.370 --> 06:58.500
He turned himself in --

06:58.500 --> 07:01.710
And said ex-con
admitted he shot you.

07:01.710 --> 07:04.340
Now you go.

07:04.340 --> 07:06.500
He's not supposed to be
in there.

07:11.840 --> 07:14.260
Your guy pled guilty,
no lawyer?

07:14.260 --> 07:17.600
That's at least grounds to
petition for a plea withdrawal.

07:17.600 --> 07:18.560
Tell him
to let the court know

07:18.560 --> 07:20.560
that I'll be
representing him now.

07:20.560 --> 07:22.940
Thanks, Teresa, but we're not
exactly in communication.

07:22.940 --> 07:25.520
Can we get the ball rolling
first, and then,

07:25.520 --> 07:27.780
once I talk to him or --
I can start some digging,

07:27.780 --> 07:31.320
but until I'm his lawyer,
my hands are tied.

07:34.370 --> 07:37.410
Saanvi's server is clean.

07:37.410 --> 07:38.870
Swept for bugs,
her lab's clean.

07:38.870 --> 07:40.410
So, where's the leak?

07:40.410 --> 07:41.710
The Major has someone
inside the hospital?

07:41.710 --> 07:43.290
Presumably.
Any clue who it is?

07:43.290 --> 07:44.790
My guys
are keeping a close eye --

07:44.790 --> 07:46.500
Well, that's not good enough.
Saanvi's in danger.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.550
I have a plan if you'll just
shut up for a minute.

07:48.550 --> 07:49.960
Vance, we need
to find this mole.

07:49.960 --> 07:51.550
No.

07:51.550 --> 07:55.390
We need to let the mole
lead us to the Major.

07:55.390 --> 07:58.390
Everything we know tells us
what the Major wants

07:58.390 --> 08:00.020
is to control the Callings,

08:00.020 --> 08:02.770
to be sending the messages
you're compelled to follow --

08:02.770 --> 08:04.770
you, your -- your sister,
your son.

08:04.770 --> 08:07.770
We'd...be her toy soldiers.

08:07.770 --> 08:10.990
So let's point her
to the ultimate soldier,

08:10.990 --> 08:13.700
a passenger whose Callings
are stronger than Cal's even.

08:13.700 --> 08:15.910
Yeah, but I haven't found
anyone who's...

08:19.990 --> 08:21.910
You mean
we feed the Major a fake.

08:21.910 --> 08:24.580
Pick someone from your board.
Make it look legit.

08:24.580 --> 08:26.420
I have an address
in Pennsylvania.

08:26.420 --> 08:28.040
You'll tell Saanvi
he's there.

08:28.040 --> 08:31.550
The ruse percolates up
to the Major, she'll bite.

08:35.470 --> 08:37.640
So not only do we continue
to lie to Saanvi --

08:37.640 --> 08:41.140
We use her.
This -- This sucks.

08:41.140 --> 08:43.600
No one said making the world
a safer place

08:43.600 --> 08:46.480
was gonna be easy, but the
sooner we find the Major,

08:46.480 --> 08:48.820
the sooner we all go back
to our lives.

08:48.820 --> 08:52.860
And this leak in your friend's
lab, it's our best shot.

08:54.610 --> 08:56.070
Set the trap.

09:00.660 --> 09:02.200
Bye.

09:03.410 --> 09:06.040
Oh.

09:06.040 --> 09:07.960
Are you okay?

09:07.960 --> 09:09.710
Thought I'd puke less
this time.

09:09.710 --> 09:11.710
Oh, here.

09:11.710 --> 09:14.800
Only thing
that keeps food down.

09:14.800 --> 09:16.380
I'm not a fan of ginger,

09:16.380 --> 09:18.760
but I'll eat roadkill
if it quells the nausea.

09:18.760 --> 09:21.180
I feel you.

09:21.180 --> 09:23.770
Not only am I bigger
than I was with twins --

09:23.770 --> 09:25.480
I'm also sicker.

09:25.480 --> 09:28.190
I swear my 6-year-old thinks
her mommy's hung over.

09:28.190 --> 09:29.270
You haven't told her yet?

09:29.270 --> 09:30.650
Once we're out of the woods.

09:30.650 --> 09:31.900
Here, thanks.

09:31.900 --> 09:33.780
Keep it. I can make more.

09:33.780 --> 09:36.070
You made these?

09:36.070 --> 09:37.280
We can't be friends.

09:37.280 --> 09:39.030
Oh.
But I offer free refills.

09:40.070 --> 09:41.700
Solidarity!
Thanks.

09:43.620 --> 09:45.710
Grace:
Open her eyes.

10:10.230 --> 10:11.520
Hey, there.
How you doing?

10:11.520 --> 10:13.110
I'm here to see
Ezekiel Landon.

10:13.110 --> 10:14.530
You gonna be on the list
this time?

10:17.860 --> 10:20.320
Look, man. I just --
I really need to see him.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.120
Hold up.

10:22.120 --> 10:24.910
He's not here. It seems
he's been transferred.

10:24.910 --> 10:26.750
What's -- Where?

10:26.750 --> 10:28.250
Doesn't say.
The system's messed up.

10:28.250 --> 10:29.710
It could take a few days
to update.

10:32.750 --> 10:34.880
What did you give me?

10:37.470 --> 10:38.930
What'd you give me, damn it?!

10:38.930 --> 10:40.340
Okay, calm down.

10:40.340 --> 10:41.760
It was just something
to help you sleep.

10:41.760 --> 10:43.390
What the hell was it?!
Mostly midazolam.

10:43.390 --> 10:45.350
I'm in recovery!
You can't give me that junk!

10:45.350 --> 10:46.770
Look, your doctor rounds
in the morning.

10:46.770 --> 10:48.520
We'll take it up with him.

10:48.520 --> 10:50.980
But if you don't want any more,
you need to chill.

10:54.770 --> 10:57.820
I'm worried, Ben. What if it's
not just an error in the system?

10:57.820 --> 11:00.490
What if it's the Major? I mean,
she's taken people before.

11:00.490 --> 11:01.990
Yeah, but not from
police custody.

11:01.990 --> 11:03.870
What if that's what the Callings
are warning us about?

11:03.870 --> 11:06.490
I mean, I'm not gonna lose him,
okay? Not like that.

11:06.490 --> 11:09.540
Mick, you're spinning.
Just keep looking.

11:09.540 --> 11:13.380
And if the Major did take Zeke,
we will find him...

11:13.380 --> 11:15.750
when we find her.

11:15.750 --> 11:17.510
Talk to you later.

11:21.630 --> 11:23.600
There you are.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.760
Why is a public defender asking
for Zeke's arrest report?

11:26.760 --> 11:27.930
Why do you think?

11:27.930 --> 11:29.930
Christ, Mick.

11:29.930 --> 11:31.310
The guy confessed.

11:31.310 --> 11:32.940
Just let it go already.

11:32.940 --> 11:34.940
You want to know
how I let this go, Jared?

11:34.940 --> 11:36.520
You revise the report,
and you clarify

11:36.520 --> 11:37.900
that the shooting was
an accident.

11:37.900 --> 11:38.900
I won't do that.

11:38.900 --> 11:41.150
It was an accident.

11:41.150 --> 11:42.610
We both know that.

11:42.610 --> 11:44.990
No, it was a legit collar.

11:44.990 --> 11:47.660
I know that, and so does
everybody else in this office.

11:47.660 --> 11:51.620
Mick, you keep pushing this,
it's not gonna end well for you.

11:51.620 --> 11:54.040
Is that a threat?

11:55.960 --> 11:59.010
I am trying to get
an innocent man out of jail.

11:59.010 --> 12:01.630
Please,
do not make this about us.

12:01.630 --> 12:04.430
Seriously?

12:04.430 --> 12:07.930
This has everything
to do with us.

12:07.930 --> 12:10.640
I blew up my entire life
for you.

12:15.230 --> 12:17.650
Yeah, I know.

12:21.190 --> 12:24.240
I need us to do the right
thing, though, please.

12:24.240 --> 12:27.990
I'm asking for us
to fix this together.

12:31.580 --> 12:33.830
You're asking for too much,
Mick.

12:33.830 --> 12:35.420
I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna
torpedo my career

12:35.420 --> 12:37.630
for some guy I barely trust.
Just stop. Please.

12:40.250 --> 12:44.930
I am not trying to hurt you.
Truly.

12:47.260 --> 12:49.430
But I'm gonna help Zeke,

12:49.430 --> 12:52.100
and I'm gonna do whatever
it takes to do that.

12:52.100 --> 12:57.060
If you don't want to help me,
that is your choice.

12:57.060 --> 12:59.730
But be prepared.

12:59.730 --> 13:02.650
Was that a threat?

13:02.650 --> 13:05.110
Didn't have to be.

13:17.540 --> 13:20.920
Hey.
Hey.

13:20.920 --> 13:22.880
Mom had
another Calling.

13:22.880 --> 13:24.630
Really?

13:24.630 --> 13:27.680
Yeah, I met this great mom
at the yoga studio today.

13:27.680 --> 13:30.050
And when she was leaving,
I heard myself saying,

13:30.050 --> 13:31.930
"Open her eyes."

13:31.930 --> 13:35.940
And then I saw this awful
gargoyle on her car,

13:35.940 --> 13:37.270
like, looming.

13:37.270 --> 13:39.690
Honey, that's terrifying.
Are -- Are you okay?

13:39.690 --> 13:41.730
I'm fine. I'm just --
I'm worried about her.

13:41.730 --> 13:43.480
I can't shake
this bad feeling.

13:43.480 --> 13:46.280
This creature was terrifying,
but we looked up gargoyles,

13:46.280 --> 13:47.450
and, apparently,
they're supposed

13:47.450 --> 13:49.280
to protect you from evil.

13:49.280 --> 13:50.780
So I don't know.

13:50.780 --> 13:52.290
Maybe I'm supposed to open
her eyes to that?

13:52.290 --> 13:53.910
Maybe she's in
some kind of trouble?

13:53.910 --> 13:56.660
Maybe she'll be
in the next class?

13:56.660 --> 13:59.000
I can't wait till then.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.960
So...

14:00.960 --> 14:02.130
track her down.

14:02.130 --> 14:03.800
Yeah.

14:03.800 --> 14:06.510
She had a Metro Kids Soccer
bumper sticker.

14:06.510 --> 14:08.300
I'll look up
where the teams practice.

14:11.260 --> 14:13.060
What are you doing?
Helping you.

14:13.060 --> 14:15.270
Absolutely not.
You have enough on your plate.

14:15.270 --> 14:17.060
We got this.

14:17.060 --> 14:19.400
Well, is there anything
I can do to help?

14:19.400 --> 14:21.110
No, babe.

14:21.110 --> 14:23.070
We're good.
You get your work done.

14:23.070 --> 14:24.570
Cal: I found the website.

14:24.570 --> 14:26.150
Awesome.

14:26.150 --> 14:29.110
Wow.
I'll leave you to it, then.

14:29.110 --> 14:30.280
Call if you need me.

14:30.280 --> 14:32.490
Bye.

14:32.490 --> 14:35.080
So, she said her kid was 6.

14:35.080 --> 14:37.540
Does it say where
the younger teams practice?

14:40.540 --> 14:42.790
Troy: Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.

14:42.790 --> 14:44.840
Gimme aces!

14:49.970 --> 14:52.970
What are we looking for,
exactly?

14:52.970 --> 14:55.180
I know, I know.
Drug-company NDA.

14:55.180 --> 14:57.020
I'm just a fly on the wall.

14:57.020 --> 15:00.060
Just thank me
when you get your Nobel.

15:08.190 --> 15:10.860
I'm vibing epic fail.

15:10.860 --> 15:12.240
We have time
for another round.

15:12.240 --> 15:16.330
Um...burnout
is actually a thing.

15:16.330 --> 15:18.580
When is the last time
you slept?

15:26.090 --> 15:27.210
Hi.
Hey.

15:27.210 --> 15:28.590
I wasn't expecting you
today.

15:32.010 --> 15:34.260
I think I found
a new Holy Grail.

15:42.060 --> 15:44.190
This guy's Callings
are insane, Ben.

15:44.190 --> 15:45.230
If you didn't interview him
yourself,

15:45.230 --> 15:47.190
I would never believe it.

15:47.190 --> 15:49.030
He's in Philly?

15:49.030 --> 15:50.820
Okay, I need to get
his bloodwork for the lab.

15:50.820 --> 15:52.070
When can we go see him?

15:52.070 --> 15:54.030
Uh, I'll check my calendar.

15:54.030 --> 15:55.490
Well, how about now?

15:55.490 --> 15:57.240
If this guy is having
more intense Callings,

15:57.240 --> 15:58.790
he may have a longer strand
of the mutated gene.

15:58.790 --> 16:00.500
It might be easier for me
to isolate.

16:03.120 --> 16:04.790
What's wrong with you?

16:04.790 --> 16:06.000
What do you mean?

16:06.000 --> 16:07.210
Well, why aren't you
more excited?

16:07.210 --> 16:08.500
This could be
our breakthrough.

16:08.500 --> 16:10.420
The Callings, the Death Date
could all go away.

16:10.420 --> 16:13.430
I mean, isn't this what we've
been working our asses off for?

16:13.430 --> 16:15.720
Oh, of course it is.

16:15.720 --> 16:17.890
I may have gotten a job.

16:17.890 --> 16:19.310
That's really great news.

16:19.310 --> 16:21.100
I need to give a lecture,
meet the faculty.

16:21.100 --> 16:23.060
There's a lot right now.

16:23.060 --> 16:25.060
Well, they would be
really lucky to have you.

16:28.230 --> 16:30.110
Just as soon as you can.

16:30.110 --> 16:31.690
Yeah.

16:37.740 --> 16:40.410
He would've just transferred in
the other day or...

16:40.410 --> 16:43.120
Are you sure there's nothing?

16:43.120 --> 16:44.870
Okay. Thank you.

16:44.870 --> 16:47.460
Ezekiel Landon?
Nothing?

16:47.460 --> 16:48.710
Okay.

16:48.710 --> 16:50.500
Uh, yeah. Hi.
Just checking in.

16:50.500 --> 16:55.720
Checking in to see if you got
my message about Ezekiel Landon.

16:58.140 --> 16:59.640
Hi there.

16:59.640 --> 17:01.520
I'm Detective Stone
from the 129th.

17:01.520 --> 17:04.440
Uh, I'm good. Thank you.
How are you?

17:04.440 --> 17:07.060
Yeah, um, just need some help
tracking down an inmate --

17:07.060 --> 17:08.270
Ezekiel Landon.

17:08.270 --> 17:10.730
E-Z-E-K--

17:10.730 --> 17:12.940
You do? You have him?

17:12.940 --> 17:14.280
Can I talk to him?

17:14.280 --> 17:15.780
No, no, no, please,
I just need one minute

17:15.780 --> 17:18.120
to just talk to him
about something.

17:22.160 --> 17:23.960
Zeke!

17:28.880 --> 17:31.920
Zeke! Zeke!

17:31.920 --> 17:33.710
Grab my hand!

17:33.710 --> 17:35.970
Zeke, please!
Come on! Come on!

17:37.090 --> 17:38.390
Grab my hand!

17:42.310 --> 17:44.020
Zeke, no!

17:54.540 --> 17:57.120
So, your fate's in the hands
of the Hiring Committee.

17:57.120 --> 17:58.370
They're all sitting in.
I talked you up.

17:58.370 --> 17:59.750
Thanks for that.

17:59.750 --> 18:01.130
Left out
the part about us.

18:01.130 --> 18:02.340
Doubly thanks for that.

18:02.340 --> 18:03.960
Dr. Tobin in the middle?

18:03.960 --> 18:06.130
Big fan of your paper
on computational math.

18:06.130 --> 18:07.840
Her vote's in the bag.
Uh-huh.

18:07.840 --> 18:10.640
Bow tie's the one
to impress -- Simon.

18:10.640 --> 18:11.840
Okay.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.390
Professor Stone.

18:13.390 --> 18:15.310
TJ!

18:15.310 --> 18:17.020
What are you doing here?

18:17.020 --> 18:19.060
I saw the tweet about your
lecture, figured I'd sit in.

18:19.060 --> 18:21.020
Why?
'Cause you needed a nap?

18:21.020 --> 18:22.400
I'll try not
to snore too loud.

18:22.400 --> 18:23.610
Okay, I'll see you in there.

18:23.610 --> 18:24.730
-Good luck.
-Alright.

18:24.730 --> 18:26.030
What did I tell you all?

18:26.030 --> 18:29.030
He's already a favorite
with the students.

18:29.030 --> 18:30.660
Professors Gin Otani...

18:30.660 --> 18:32.160
Hi. How you doing?
...Carol Tobin...

18:32.160 --> 18:33.950
Hi.
...Simon White.

18:33.950 --> 18:35.160
Hi.
Professor Stone.

18:35.160 --> 18:37.080
Suzanne raves about you,
Ben.

18:37.080 --> 18:38.660
We're delighted
you're considering us.

18:38.660 --> 18:40.250
I'm glad to be here.

18:40.250 --> 18:43.040
Okay. Well, let's get
this party started.

18:44.750 --> 18:47.420
This will be a great way
to ease back in.

18:47.420 --> 18:48.760
It's a pretty sleepy class.

18:48.760 --> 18:51.090
Enrollment's about
half capacity.

18:51.090 --> 18:54.010
Okay.

18:57.770 --> 18:59.430
Mm.

18:59.430 --> 19:02.600
Guess my tweet about our special
guest lecture piqued interest.

19:14.200 --> 19:17.240
You all know this is
Combinatorics, right?

19:17.240 --> 19:19.080
I hear Game Theory's
down the hall.

19:20.870 --> 19:24.080
No one? Alright.

19:24.080 --> 19:30.050
So, how many of you
are actually math majors?

19:30.050 --> 19:31.260
Okay.

19:31.260 --> 19:34.180
Uh, anyone like old movies?

19:34.180 --> 19:35.680
-Sure.
-Mm-hmm.

19:35.680 --> 19:36.890
Who's seen "The Matrix"?

19:36.890 --> 19:38.060
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh, yeah.

19:38.060 --> 19:39.930
Welcome back
from outer space!

19:42.230 --> 19:44.810
Thank you. I guess.

19:44.810 --> 19:46.440
Now, the fun thing
about higher math --

19:46.440 --> 19:50.110
and, yes, I said fun -- is that
it can describe something

19:50.110 --> 19:52.860
as complex
as simulated reality.

19:52.860 --> 19:55.070
Let's say this is Earth.

19:55.070 --> 19:57.700
Speaking of, where do
you think the plane went?

19:57.700 --> 20:00.120
What's the probability 828
got sucked through a wormhole,

20:00.120 --> 20:02.040
versus being hijacked
by aliens?

20:03.330 --> 20:05.750
While you propose
a fascinating hypothetical,

20:05.750 --> 20:07.420
to assess a baseline --

20:07.420 --> 20:09.960
Professor Stone, is your IQ
higher than it used to be?

20:09.960 --> 20:12.300
I heard that one of the
passengers cured cancer.

20:12.300 --> 20:15.340
Woman: Flight 828 didn't touch
down for 5 1/2 years.

20:15.340 --> 20:16.840
Where did it fly?
Man: Are you, like,
smarter than Einstein?

20:16.840 --> 20:18.140
Uh...
Woman #2: Did you shrink?

20:18.140 --> 20:20.100
Man #2:
Can you predict the future?

20:20.100 --> 20:21.930
To assess a -- a...

20:21.930 --> 20:25.560
I read your thesis on
combinatorial matrix theory.

20:25.560 --> 20:28.270
Couldn't that have been used
to map the flight plan of 828?

20:28.270 --> 20:30.110
Great question.

20:30.110 --> 20:34.990
We'll start simple and define
some geocentric coordinates.

20:34.990 --> 20:39.910
Now, to compute the coordinates
of "C" using Bancroft's method,

20:39.910 --> 20:42.160
we'll construct
a four-by-four matrix

20:42.160 --> 20:46.710
with the satellites' coordinates
and respective pseudoranges --

20:46.710 --> 20:48.500
not to be confused
with pseudo-oranges,

20:48.500 --> 20:50.090
which taste terrible.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.210
But we can use them
to help us find

20:53.210 --> 20:55.170
our unknown receiver quantities.

20:55.170 --> 20:59.890
And then we will encapsulate
them in a vector "U."

20:59.890 --> 21:04.480
It says the U6 girls practice
on the east field.

21:04.480 --> 21:06.100
Good job, sleuth!

21:07.900 --> 21:10.730
I wish
I could see a gargoyle.

21:10.730 --> 21:13.360
No, you don't.
Trust me.

21:13.360 --> 21:16.150
Mom,
I've seen way worse stuff.

21:18.530 --> 21:20.370
I wish you didn't have to.

21:20.370 --> 21:23.040
Erika:
Bring it in! Snack time!

21:23.040 --> 21:25.200
Good effort, girls!
Good effort!

21:25.200 --> 21:27.370
Orange slices.
That's her.

21:33.840 --> 21:35.970
Good job. Good job.

21:40.140 --> 21:41.430
Alright.

21:41.430 --> 21:43.180
Erika?

21:43.180 --> 21:44.430
Hi.

21:44.430 --> 21:46.850
Grace. Ginger lady?

21:46.850 --> 21:48.980
Oh. Right.

21:48.980 --> 21:50.860
Hi. I haven't seen you
here before.

21:50.860 --> 21:52.610
No, it's our first time.

21:52.610 --> 21:55.610
Actually, I'm trying to get
my bookworm son into a sport.

21:57.280 --> 21:58.740
Right.

21:58.740 --> 22:00.990
I think
sign-ups are closed.

22:00.990 --> 22:03.370
Um, you're not green,

22:03.370 --> 22:05.410
so I take it
the nausea's better.

22:05.410 --> 22:06.870
Is everything else okay?

22:06.870 --> 22:08.410
I know second pregnancies
can be so hard.

22:08.410 --> 22:10.250
Pulled in every dire--
I have to run.

22:10.250 --> 22:11.670
My husband's waiting
for me.

22:11.670 --> 22:13.290
Holly!

22:13.290 --> 22:15.000
Come on.
What are you doing?

22:16.630 --> 22:18.630
Grace:
Open her eyes.

22:30.640 --> 22:32.400
You had it again.

22:34.400 --> 22:36.860
She's scared of something.

22:36.860 --> 22:38.240
But when the person
you're called to help

22:38.240 --> 22:40.650
doesn't want to be helped,
what do you do?

22:46.290 --> 22:48.410
Detective Stone.
I need a one-on-one with a C.I.

22:48.410 --> 22:50.330
Patient Ezekiel Landon.

22:50.330 --> 22:52.290
Didn't see you on the books,
Detective. Did you call ahead?

22:52.290 --> 22:54.130
An emergency came up.
Consider this calling.

22:54.130 --> 22:55.420
Not how this works.

22:55.420 --> 22:56.880
Dangerous guys in here.

22:56.880 --> 22:58.510
I need a guard
dedicated for the meet.

22:58.510 --> 23:00.590
Not my rules.
Great. Well,
I've got lives at stake.

23:00.590 --> 23:02.640
So if you wanna ring up my boss,
you go right ahead.

23:11.020 --> 23:12.350
Yeah.

23:12.350 --> 23:13.650
I got
a C.I.-visit request here.

23:13.650 --> 23:15.310
Ezekiel Landon.

23:27.740 --> 23:30.290
Hey. What's up?

23:30.290 --> 23:32.330
You find something new?

23:32.330 --> 23:33.960
Only the gene mutation.

23:35.500 --> 23:38.500
Or at least a mutation,
which could be watershed,

23:38.500 --> 23:40.300
maybe even the key to what
happened to us on that plane.

23:40.300 --> 23:42.050
It's like...

23:42.050 --> 23:43.510
It's like the magic bullet.

23:43.510 --> 23:46.470
Now I-I really need you
to take me to your guy, Ben,

23:46.470 --> 23:48.310
because I need to test
his blood against my trials t--

23:48.310 --> 23:50.930
I can't, uh...

23:50.930 --> 23:53.060
I can't do that.

23:53.060 --> 23:55.310
What's going on?

24:01.150 --> 24:04.860
The Major has a mole
accessing your research.

24:07.740 --> 24:09.330
How do you know that?

24:09.330 --> 24:11.580
I just do, trust me.

24:11.580 --> 24:13.330
And if your discovery
leaks to her...

24:13.330 --> 24:14.580
Saanvi...

24:14.580 --> 24:16.670
Yeah?

24:16.670 --> 24:18.000
Okay.

24:19.500 --> 24:20.500
What if the Major
already knows

24:20.500 --> 24:21.670
about the passenger's
new Callings?

24:21.670 --> 24:24.340
She --
She came after Cal.

24:24.340 --> 24:28.550
Imagine what she's --
There are no new Callings.

24:28.550 --> 24:30.560
What?

24:30.560 --> 24:33.390
It was a fake,

24:33.390 --> 24:35.350
made up as bait
to lure the Major.

24:37.520 --> 24:40.570
Okay, I don't, um...

24:40.570 --> 24:42.900
I don't understand.
Why would you lie to me?

24:42.900 --> 24:44.570
Because you were safer
not knowing.

24:44.570 --> 24:47.030
You might've inadvertently
clued in the Major.

24:50.740 --> 24:54.460
All of this, there is no way
this is just you and Michaela.

24:56.540 --> 24:58.710
You're working with someone.

25:03.920 --> 25:05.550
Vance.

25:05.550 --> 25:07.550
He survived the accident,
went into hiding.

25:07.550 --> 25:09.350
Michaela and I --
Michaela and you what?!

25:12.060 --> 25:13.600
I am part
of that group, Ben,

25:13.600 --> 25:15.390
and you didn't trust me?

25:15.390 --> 25:17.940
No, it's not about trust.
It was for your own protection.

25:17.940 --> 25:19.650
Okay, I just --
I need you to leave.

25:19.650 --> 25:21.610
Did you think I wanted to lie?
I didn't want any of this.

25:21.610 --> 25:24.440
Yeah, but you had a choice!

25:24.440 --> 25:27.070
I didn't.

25:27.070 --> 25:28.360
Go.

25:30.490 --> 25:32.280
Saanvi, please be careful.
This leak --

25:32.280 --> 25:34.040
Go.

25:57.430 --> 25:59.440
How's he not a C.I.?

25:59.440 --> 26:02.060
Detective just blew by here
claiming he's part of some case.

26:05.650 --> 26:06.650
Zeke.

26:08.070 --> 26:10.070
Oh, my God.
What have they done to you?

26:10.070 --> 26:11.450
Zeke. Hey.

26:11.450 --> 26:12.830
Hey, come on. Wake up.
Wake up.

26:12.830 --> 26:14.080
Look at me, look at me.
Michaela?

26:14.080 --> 26:15.410
Oh, my God. Thank God.

26:15.410 --> 26:16.450
Look, I don't have much time,
okay?

26:16.450 --> 26:17.830
But we got to get you
out of here.

26:17.830 --> 26:19.500
Cal and I, we had a Calling.

26:19.500 --> 26:21.040
You were on the airplane
with us.

26:21.040 --> 26:22.460
I know.

26:22.460 --> 26:23.670
I saw it, too.

26:23.670 --> 26:26.670
Good.

26:26.670 --> 26:27.670
What did they do to you?

26:27.670 --> 26:29.630
The Callings...

26:29.630 --> 26:32.720
I was shaking, and they
gave me drugs to stop it.

26:32.720 --> 26:34.640
That's why
you couldn't see us.

26:35.930 --> 26:38.140
I screwed up.

26:38.140 --> 26:39.600
You were right.

26:39.600 --> 26:41.650
I'm not supposed to be here.

26:41.650 --> 26:43.690
I'm supposed to be with you.
I'm sorry.

26:43.690 --> 26:45.230
I am here now, okay?

26:45.230 --> 26:46.690
I know, but it's too late.

26:46.690 --> 26:48.530
No, it's not.
I am getting you out of here.

26:48.530 --> 26:50.240
You never give up, do you?

26:50.740 --> 26:51.820
You can't be in here.

26:51.820 --> 26:53.160
Tell them you need a lawyer.

26:53.160 --> 26:54.450
Teresa Yin.
It's on the back of that.

26:54.450 --> 26:55.370
Tell them
that you need a lawyer.

26:55.370 --> 26:57.450
She's expecting your call!

27:03.580 --> 27:06.130
Do you have any idea
the damage you just caused?

27:06.130 --> 27:07.710
I told you,
she found the magic bullet.

27:07.710 --> 27:09.630
I couldn't risk it getting
into the wrong hands.

27:09.630 --> 27:11.380
You blew my cover,

27:11.380 --> 27:13.720
eviscerated our opportunity
to find the leak!

27:13.720 --> 27:16.180
Look, Saanvi might be pissed,

27:16.180 --> 27:17.720
but your secret is safe.

27:17.720 --> 27:19.680
I trust her.
Oh.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.770
Well, that's good to know
because now the only people

27:21.770 --> 27:26.320
who know I'm alive are
our wives, Michaela, Saanvi.

27:26.320 --> 27:27.520
I'm sorry, Vance.

27:27.520 --> 27:29.610
We need to get
in front of this.

27:30.940 --> 27:32.700
Maybe not.

27:32.700 --> 27:34.160
Saanvi could still help us
find the leak.

27:34.160 --> 27:36.700
You said yourself
espionage is a long game.

27:36.700 --> 27:39.910
Our asset is compromised.

27:39.910 --> 27:41.580
We have a very small window

27:41.580 --> 27:43.790
before this whole operation
collapses.

28:05.690 --> 28:08.110
Now that we've had
a breakthrough, what do we do?

28:08.110 --> 28:10.570
Are we modifying
our approach?

28:10.570 --> 28:12.900
You're always asking me
questions.

28:12.900 --> 28:15.740
Um, 'cause
I'm your lab assistant?

28:19.990 --> 28:21.580
Not anymore.

28:21.580 --> 28:23.210
There was no breakthrough.

28:23.210 --> 28:26.830
It was a fluke, and we're
just tilting at windmills.

28:26.830 --> 28:30.130
I appreciate your help, Troy,
but I don't need you.

28:33.920 --> 28:36.340
This doesn't make
any sense.

28:36.340 --> 28:37.590
You...

28:59.030 --> 29:00.660
Ellen? It's Saanvi.

29:00.660 --> 29:02.660
Uh, I've had
a really awful day.

29:02.660 --> 29:05.080
Is there any way
you can squeeze me in?

29:16.050 --> 29:18.050
Hey! Hi.

29:18.050 --> 29:19.850
You, um -- You weren't
in class today.

29:19.850 --> 29:20.850
I was worried.
I thought maybe you --

29:20.850 --> 29:22.640
Are you following me?

29:22.640 --> 29:24.850
No. No.

29:24.850 --> 29:26.850
I'm -- I'm sorry.

29:26.850 --> 29:29.230
This must seem very bizarre.
Uh...

29:31.020 --> 29:32.610
I'm worried about you.

29:32.610 --> 29:34.320
Call it intuition.
I don't know.

29:34.320 --> 29:36.530
I just -- I have a bad feeling
that something's wrong,

29:36.530 --> 29:39.030
and if you're, um --

29:39.030 --> 29:41.330
if you're afraid or you have
a problem --

29:41.330 --> 29:45.790
My only problem is you
and your freak 828 boy.

29:45.790 --> 29:48.540
I know who your son is.
I watch the news.

29:48.540 --> 29:50.500
I-I'm trying to help you.

29:50.500 --> 29:51.630
Stay away.

29:51.630 --> 29:53.050
Stay away from my family.

29:53.050 --> 29:55.880
Your son is an abomination.

29:55.880 --> 29:59.130
Oh, I get it!
I get it now!

29:59.130 --> 30:00.720
I was supposed to open
your eyes

30:00.720 --> 30:03.140
because you are a frightened,
small-minded woman

30:03.140 --> 30:05.680
who's afraid of anything
she doesn't understand.

30:09.810 --> 30:11.730
I hope you lose that baby.

30:19.320 --> 30:22.660
Judge Trilling: The people
versus Ezekiel Landon.

30:22.660 --> 30:24.910
Teresa: Thank you for finding
time on your docket

30:24.910 --> 30:26.950
for this emergency hearing,
Your Honor.

30:26.950 --> 30:29.750
Pursuant to Section 220.6,

30:29.750 --> 30:32.750
my client moves
to withdraw his guilty plea.

30:32.750 --> 30:36.090
Further, I've filed a motion
to dismiss all charges.

30:36.090 --> 30:38.130
I'll grant
the plea withdrawal.

30:38.130 --> 30:40.470
On what grounds
do you move to dismiss?

30:40.470 --> 30:42.760
New evidence
calling into question

30:42.760 --> 30:43.930
the veracity
of the investigation.

30:43.930 --> 30:45.810
Your Honor,
this is absurd.

30:45.810 --> 30:48.390
Mr. Landon
shot an NYPD detective.

30:48.390 --> 30:50.480
Yes. Detective Stone.

30:50.480 --> 30:51.940
I'd like to call her
as a witness.

30:51.940 --> 30:54.270
Your Honor, this is a waste
of taxpayer dollars

30:54.270 --> 30:55.770
and the court's time.

30:55.770 --> 30:56.980
And yet the court awaits

30:56.980 --> 30:59.990
Detective Stone's testimony
with interest.

30:59.990 --> 31:02.490
Your Honor, I call
Detective Michaela Stone

31:02.490 --> 31:03.740
to the stand.

31:09.790 --> 31:12.330
Detective Stone,
what do you know

31:12.330 --> 31:14.170
about the night
you were shot?

31:14.170 --> 31:15.960
I know
that it was an accident.

31:15.960 --> 31:18.340
I know that Zeke Landon
is not a criminal.

31:18.340 --> 31:20.420
He even tried
to save my life.

31:26.220 --> 31:27.970
I also know
that Detective Vasquez

31:27.970 --> 31:31.810
abused NYPD resources to lift
and run Zeke's prints.

31:31.810 --> 31:33.940
He also had him followed.

31:33.940 --> 31:36.650
He even broke into my house
without probable cause

31:36.650 --> 31:38.940
to confront Zeke.

31:38.940 --> 31:40.150
None of this had to happen.

31:40.150 --> 31:42.400
Objection --
Lacks foundation.

31:42.400 --> 31:43.820
The State demands
the courtroom be cleared

31:43.820 --> 31:45.200
and this hearing postponed.

31:45.200 --> 31:47.740
It was an accident.

31:47.740 --> 31:50.620
I've informed Internal Affairs,
the arresting officer,

31:50.620 --> 31:52.830
and my captain about this
miscarriage of justice.

31:52.830 --> 31:56.000
I am tired of being told
to let this go.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.630
I'm not going to let this go.

31:58.630 --> 32:01.010
I am the one
that took that bullet.

32:01.010 --> 32:02.550
I am the victim.

32:02.550 --> 32:05.430
And I am telling you
that this man is innocent.

32:05.430 --> 32:09.010
The State requests a sidebar,
Your Honor.

32:14.690 --> 32:17.060
Why can't I reach Saanvi?

32:17.060 --> 32:18.770
Why do you think?

32:18.770 --> 32:20.150
You warned her
she's being watched.

32:20.150 --> 32:22.030
She's being careful,
probably ditched her phone.

32:22.030 --> 32:24.820
She clearly wants nothing
to do with me or this.

32:24.820 --> 32:26.820
Let's pray she doesn't do
anything stupid.

32:26.820 --> 32:29.370
I doubt Saanvi's done anything
stupid her whole life.

32:29.370 --> 32:30.990
Well, good,

32:30.990 --> 32:34.790
'cause right now her life
is exactly what's at stake.

32:37.170 --> 32:41.250
Ben was the  one person
I thought I could trust.

32:41.250 --> 32:44.220
Yet you're not shutting down.
You reached out to me,

32:44.220 --> 32:47.010
rather than your usual pattern
of retreating.

32:47.010 --> 32:49.600
That's substantive progress.

32:54.100 --> 32:58.900
You know how you encourage me
to look for the rose?

32:58.900 --> 33:00.690
And something
that I'm grateful for?

33:00.690 --> 33:03.740
Yes, of course.

33:03.740 --> 33:05.740
I'm grateful for you.

33:11.030 --> 33:13.330
And also that I have
my research.

33:15.620 --> 33:18.250
Speaking of, I think
I made a discovery.

33:18.250 --> 33:20.630
I doubt
I'll understand a word of it,

33:20.630 --> 33:23.130
but why don't you tell me?

33:23.130 --> 33:25.920
It's huge.

33:25.920 --> 33:27.430
It may even be the key
to discovering

33:27.430 --> 33:30.760
what happened to us
on that plane.

33:30.760 --> 33:35.270
It's in my fridge
in the lab.

33:35.270 --> 33:37.940
My next client canceled.

33:37.940 --> 33:39.150
We have time.

33:41.110 --> 33:42.440
Okay.

33:45.440 --> 33:48.480
The State has decided
to reduce the charges

33:48.480 --> 33:51.320
to class A misdemeanor,
possession of a firearm.

33:51.320 --> 33:53.650
Judge Trilling:
Pretty sweet offer, Counselor.

33:53.650 --> 33:55.150
How does your client plead?

33:56.990 --> 33:58.490
Teresa:
Stand up and plead no contest.

34:01.290 --> 34:02.910
No contest, Your Honor.

34:02.910 --> 34:06.540
Very well, Mr. Landon.
You're sentenced to time served.

34:06.540 --> 34:09.000
Pending processing,
you're free to go.

34:12.130 --> 34:15.170
-Congratulations.
-Thank you very much.

34:25.140 --> 34:29.310
Guess I'm not the only one
who blew up their life.

34:29.310 --> 34:31.190
Hope it was worth it.

34:39.200 --> 34:41.910
♪ I know how to speak ♪

34:45.160 --> 34:50.170
♪ And I know where I'm going ♪

34:52.250 --> 34:55.130
♪ I wanted to seek ♪

34:58.800 --> 35:02.390
No one's ever done
anything like that for me.

35:02.390 --> 35:03.760
You didn't just storm
the castle --

35:03.760 --> 35:05.390
You burned it
to the ground.

35:05.390 --> 35:07.230
♪ It's a mirage ♪

35:07.230 --> 35:10.400
Yeah, well, you weren't
supposed to be inside.

35:10.400 --> 35:14.440
♪ One that leaves me
embarrassed ♪

35:16.990 --> 35:20.280
♪ 'Cause no one knows me
like you ♪

35:27.200 --> 35:28.370
Now what?

35:31.000 --> 35:33.170
How does
a home-cooked meal sound?

35:33.170 --> 35:37.090
You busted me outta jail.

35:37.090 --> 35:39.430
Least I can do
is cook for you.

35:39.430 --> 35:42.350
Yeah, that's true.

35:43.760 --> 35:45.470
In a surprising turn of events,

35:45.470 --> 35:49.640
Flight 828 passenger and
NYPD detective Michaela Stone

35:49.640 --> 35:52.480
took the stand today to
exonerate her alleged shooter,

35:52.480 --> 35:53.860
Ezekiel Landon.

35:53.860 --> 35:55.400
How 'bout you turn
that crap off?

35:55.400 --> 35:57.400
How 'bout some manners?

35:59.200 --> 36:01.410
Can you turn that crap off,
please?

36:01.410 --> 36:03.200
Amen to that, brother.

36:03.200 --> 36:05.660
828 wing nuts
shouldn't be allowed

36:05.660 --> 36:08.500
to carry
the badge and gun.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.620
Put those on my tab.

36:25.050 --> 36:26.430
Zeke:
This could be a disaster.

36:26.430 --> 36:29.100
-Well, let's hope not.
-Yeah, let's hope not.

36:29.100 --> 36:31.940
I don't know who's happier
that Zeke's back,

36:31.940 --> 36:33.940
you or
that giddy little boy.

36:36.400 --> 36:38.820
Cal seems to think
the plane Callings will stop.

36:41.280 --> 36:43.070
You don't?

36:43.070 --> 36:44.700
I think
it's bigger than that.

36:49.750 --> 36:53.080
I wish I could protect Cal
from all of this.

36:53.080 --> 36:55.170
It really hit home,

36:55.170 --> 36:59.510
how much fear and hatred
there is out there.

36:59.510 --> 37:01.510
That woman
had so much venom.

37:02.880 --> 37:04.890
Maybe if she knew
what miracles you guys are,

37:04.890 --> 37:06.390
she wouldn't be so scared.

37:06.390 --> 37:08.060
You mean if she knew
about the Callings?

37:08.060 --> 37:09.890
Well, if it were me,

37:09.890 --> 37:12.100
I'd share my gift
with the world,

37:12.100 --> 37:13.850
make it a better place.

37:19.980 --> 37:22.280
Where did little
Miss Peace and Love come from?

37:22.280 --> 37:23.990
I don't know, but too bad
you can't sprinkle

37:23.990 --> 37:25.570
some of that
on the gargoyle lady.

37:28.490 --> 37:32.120
The Calling told me
to open her eyes,

37:32.120 --> 37:33.790
but I didn't.

37:36.500 --> 37:38.670
Maybe it's not over, then.

37:42.300 --> 37:45.380
Who wishes to share
their acceptance of the miracle?

38:14.540 --> 38:16.500
Um, I'm Olive.

38:16.500 --> 38:18.460
Together: Hi, Olive.

38:21.960 --> 38:27.550
My dad, my brother, and my aunt
were all 828 passengers.

38:33.060 --> 38:34.600
Since they've returned,

38:34.600 --> 38:39.360
I've been fighting
to go back to normal.

38:39.360 --> 38:43.440
I just -- I didn't feel like
I belonged anymore.

38:43.440 --> 38:47.400
But, being here...

38:47.400 --> 38:51.030
I now realize that we --
we all belong.

38:51.030 --> 38:54.410
All of us are special.

38:54.410 --> 38:56.410
All of us.

38:58.420 --> 39:01.460
I embrace the miracle,

39:01.460 --> 39:05.590
and I-I really hope
my family does, too.

39:05.590 --> 39:07.680
I believe.

39:07.680 --> 39:10.430
Blessed are the children
of the returned,

39:10.430 --> 39:12.470
for they will inherit
the miracle.

39:12.470 --> 39:15.890
Together: Blessed are
the children of the returned,

39:15.890 --> 39:18.600
for they will inherit
the miracle.

39:18.600 --> 39:21.190
Blessed are the children
of the returned,

39:21.190 --> 39:23.610
for they will inherit
the miracle.

39:23.610 --> 39:25.110
You were great today.

39:25.110 --> 39:26.860
You kept the students awake
and off their phones.

39:26.860 --> 39:28.820
I'm just glad
they didn't boo me.

39:28.820 --> 39:32.070
We want you to lead a seminar
on our next faculty retreat --

39:32.070 --> 39:34.240
"Making Math Accessible."

39:34.240 --> 39:35.450
Great.

39:35.450 --> 39:37.000
Ah, the wife.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.620
Welcome aboard, Ben.
Thank you.

39:38.620 --> 39:41.460
I'll show to your new office,
Professor Stone.

39:58.560 --> 39:59.640
What did you do?

39:59.640 --> 40:01.560
I hired him.

40:01.560 --> 40:04.440
"Welcome to my parlor,"
said the spider to the fly.

40:26.500 --> 40:28.670
You were right.

40:28.670 --> 40:29.840
I found the leak.

40:37.100 --> 40:38.520
Saanvi:
When I found out I had a leak,

40:38.520 --> 40:40.180
I had to see for myself,
so...

40:40.180 --> 40:42.390
Vance: You set up
your own surveillance.

40:42.390 --> 40:45.400
See?
I told you she could help.

40:45.400 --> 40:46.980
What's he doing?

40:46.980 --> 40:49.400
Siphoning samples of my vials
so I wouldn't notice.

40:49.400 --> 40:51.280
You know this guy?
Dr. Mathews.

40:51.280 --> 40:53.320
But however he's involved,
he's not the leak.

40:53.320 --> 40:54.660
How do you know?

40:54.660 --> 40:56.660
I only told one person
about that vial.

41:00.080 --> 41:03.000
My psychiatrist, who
Mathews introduced me to --

41:03.000 --> 41:04.580
Dr. Ellen Regier.

41:04.580 --> 41:07.210
I'm sorry, Saanvi.
I really am.

41:07.210 --> 41:09.710
We never should've kept you
in the dark.

41:09.710 --> 41:13.590
Kudos to your audacity, but
now the Major has your findings,

41:13.590 --> 41:15.800
the ramifications of which
I can't even begin to describe.

41:15.800 --> 41:17.640
Those vials were fake.

41:18.930 --> 41:20.770
It'll take them weeks
to figure it out.

41:20.770 --> 41:22.640
You set up a trap?

41:23.810 --> 41:26.440
Oh, she is a much better spy
than you, Stone.

41:26.440 --> 41:29.530
How is Dr. Regier
involved in all of this?

41:29.530 --> 41:30.530
Do you have a description?

41:31.990 --> 41:36.120
Alright. Pretty much every
top-secret-security-cleared

41:36.120 --> 41:38.620
female in the DoD.

41:38.620 --> 41:40.120
Recognize anyone?

41:42.580 --> 41:44.790
There.

41:44.790 --> 41:46.210
That's her.

41:46.210 --> 41:47.580
You certain?

41:47.580 --> 41:49.750
I poured my heart out
to that bitch for months.

41:49.750 --> 41:51.170
Yes, that's her.

41:51.170 --> 41:52.630
"Kathryn Fitz.

41:52.630 --> 41:54.800
Psychological warfare
specialist,

41:54.800 --> 41:59.180
30 years in black ops.

41:59.180 --> 42:00.640
Major General."

42:00.640 --> 42:02.680
She's not informing
the Major.

42:03.770 --> 42:05.560
She is the Major.

42:09.360 --> 42:10.650
Now what?

42:12.780 --> 42:14.610
Now we turn
the tables.
