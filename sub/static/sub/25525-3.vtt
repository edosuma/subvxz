<font color="white" face="Arial" size="24px">Garret: <i>Previously on
"The Outpost"...</i> </font>

00:03.580 --> 00:05.750
- Dred: <i>No one left alive.
</i>- You've lost too much of that
  black blood of yours.

00:05.750 --> 00:07.419
Look, I'm not interested
in your prophecies.

00:07.419 --> 00:10.460
You have to learn
to control it soon
or it will kill.

00:10.460 --> 00:13.039
- ( growling )
- Go away!

00:13.039 --> 00:15.580
A few hundred score
of raw colipsum.

00:15.580 --> 00:17.420
Cross me,
and you're cut off.

00:17.420 --> 00:20.210
Follow him.
Day and night,
wherever he goes.

00:20.210 --> 00:22.620
You heard my father.
You're still in my custody.

00:22.620 --> 00:24.750
Marshal Wythers
is your father?

00:24.750 --> 00:27.579
You're here and now condemned
for the murder of Toru Magmoor,

00:27.579 --> 00:30.379
for which crime
you'll be sentenced to death.

00:30.379 --> 00:33.119
- Kell, is that you?
- ( both grunting )

( pounding on door )

00:53.579 --> 00:54.960
( pounding continues )

00:57.829 --> 00:59.380
Hello?

01:01.079 --> 01:02.079
Hello?

01:06.790 --> 01:07.829
What the--

01:10.539 --> 01:11.670
( grunts )

01:17.539 --> 01:19.960
Talon, you're not even
meant to be walking around.
Your wounds!

01:19.960 --> 01:22.210
All better. Good as new.

01:22.210 --> 01:24.620
I need you to look
at my friend.

01:24.620 --> 01:26.500
You killed
the Captain's friend?

01:26.500 --> 01:29.420
Just look at the body,
Janzo.

01:29.420 --> 01:30.750
A Plagueling?
Are you crazy?

01:30.750 --> 01:32.210
You brought a Plagueling
inside the walls?

01:32.210 --> 01:33.789
A dead Plagueling,

01:33.789 --> 01:36.789
and he turned into one
inside the walls.

01:36.789 --> 01:38.539
- That's never
  happened before.
- Yes, I know.

01:38.539 --> 01:40.120
- That's why
  I brought him to you.
- Come, bring him over.

01:40.120 --> 01:42.000
I need you to figure this out.

01:44.829 --> 01:47.460
- Help, please.
- Okay. Chop, chop.

01:47.460 --> 01:49.329
Careful, careful.

01:49.329 --> 01:51.420
( grunts )

01:51.420 --> 01:53.329
Hmm.

01:53.329 --> 01:56.579
Truly disgusting.

01:56.579 --> 02:00.459
This is quite
a collection of...

02:00.459 --> 02:04.040
whatever this is.

02:08.330 --> 02:11.080
What exactly
do you do down here?

02:11.080 --> 02:14.669
Oh, you know,
just mostly dismember bodies,
making magic potions.

02:14.669 --> 02:18.289
Yeah, I figured.

02:18.289 --> 02:20.079
It's a brewery, Captain.
I make ale.

02:21.879 --> 02:23.750
- Oh.
- Yeah. Back to
  this Plagueling

02:23.750 --> 02:25.420
that you just dumped down
my chute.

02:25.420 --> 02:27.539
What exactly is it that
you want me to figure out?

02:27.539 --> 02:31.120
Well, the Plaguelings,
why do some people
get stuck by one and turn,

02:31.120 --> 02:32.920
and others get stuck
and don't?

02:32.920 --> 02:35.039
And how did it happen to
my friend here in the Outpost?

02:35.039 --> 02:37.210
People have been
trying to figure that out
across the realm

02:37.210 --> 02:38.620
ever since people
have been getting sick.

02:38.620 --> 02:39.750
Now, what under the gods
makes you think

02:39.750 --> 02:41.170
that I'll be able
to figure some--

02:41.170 --> 02:43.079
Janzo, I told Garret
to bring Kell here.

02:45.460 --> 02:46.879
You did?

02:46.879 --> 02:50.000
What you did for me
with those powders--

02:50.000 --> 02:52.379
the closest thing I know
to a scientist or healer.

02:54.420 --> 02:57.670
Right. Yes.

02:57.670 --> 02:59.250
I guess I am
the most qualified
for the job.

03:01.669 --> 03:02.669
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.

03:02.669 --> 03:04.460
This is Kell,

03:04.460 --> 03:07.080
a good soldier
and a very dear friend.

03:07.080 --> 03:11.919
So you will treat him
with dignity and respect.

03:11.919 --> 03:13.919
Of course, Captain.

03:13.919 --> 03:16.120
I'll still have to
cut him apart, though.

03:16.120 --> 03:19.120
Of course,
but do it respectfully.

03:19.120 --> 03:20.750
Did you notice anything
different about him?

03:20.750 --> 03:23.539
Anything strange?
Beforehand, I mean.

03:23.539 --> 03:26.960
Yes, he was sweaty
and pale this morning,
and very hungry.

03:26.960 --> 03:29.620
Same as all the other cases?

03:29.620 --> 03:32.829
You should know
the signs by now.

03:32.829 --> 03:35.120
Really? Should I?

03:40.460 --> 03:41.460
( mutters )

03:49.960 --> 03:51.960
- ( shrieks )
- ( screams )

03:54.750 --> 04:00.169
By the way, Plaguelings have
nasty little creatures
in their throats.

04:00.169 --> 04:02.750
You should know that by now.

04:20.959 --> 04:25.879
- Ahem.
- So, what do you think?

04:25.879 --> 04:28.959
- Think about what?
- Plaguelings.

04:28.959 --> 04:30.959
How do they work
and how do we fight them?

04:30.959 --> 04:32.379
Well, how on earth
am I meant to know?

04:32.379 --> 04:33.790
It could take absolute
years of research

04:33.790 --> 04:35.209
before I even begin
to understand.

04:35.209 --> 04:37.040
Years?
We need answers now,

04:37.040 --> 04:39.250
or else what is the point
of all this?

04:39.250 --> 04:42.379
To make ale, Captain.

04:44.790 --> 04:46.120
Look,
if I'm going to do this,

04:46.120 --> 04:48.290
then I'm going to
need some more specimens.

04:48.290 --> 04:50.420
You mean more dead bodies?

04:50.420 --> 04:51.750
Where can I get
some more Plaguelings?

04:51.750 --> 04:53.420
We kill Plaguelings
every night.

04:53.420 --> 04:54.829
Come out to the pass.

04:54.829 --> 04:56.620
( laughs )
No, I'm going to need

04:56.620 --> 04:58.670
the bodies here,
where my tools are.

04:58.670 --> 05:01.959
I am not bringing more
Plaguelings inside the walls.

05:01.959 --> 05:05.040
Don't worry, Captain.
I promise you everything
will be fine.

05:05.040 --> 05:08.000
Next time, just make sure
that they're well
and truly dead, yes?

05:11.209 --> 05:13.209
( indistinct chatter )

05:52.459 --> 05:55.040
( cawing )

05:57.500 --> 05:58.790
( clanging )

06:02.290 --> 06:04.290
( squelching )

06:11.790 --> 06:15.290
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

06:21.790 --> 06:24.040
I've been meaning to
thank you, Captain.

06:24.040 --> 06:26.750
I'd have been executed
if it weren't for you.

06:26.750 --> 06:28.500
Just did what I thought
Gwynn would want.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.500
Is there something wrong?

06:33.290 --> 06:36.000
Gwynn gave her bond
to set you free.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.079
You have no idea
what that means, do you?

06:38.079 --> 06:40.709
No, not really, I don't.

06:40.709 --> 06:44.790
If you break the law,
Gwynn is equally guilty.

06:44.790 --> 06:47.670
Wythers will cut off
both your heads.

06:47.670 --> 06:49.209
Well, even if I did
do something,

06:49.209 --> 06:51.329
I'm not saying I would,

06:51.329 --> 06:53.209
I mean, surely your father
could pardon her.

06:53.209 --> 06:57.209
Not lawfully, no.

06:57.209 --> 06:59.540
And when the Prime Order
comes to investigate,

06:59.540 --> 07:02.000
and they will come
to investigate...

07:02.000 --> 07:03.379
( door opens )

07:03.379 --> 07:06.829
...the whole thing
puts Gwynn in mortal danger.

07:06.829 --> 07:08.959
Why would the Prime Order
care about Gwynn?

07:13.329 --> 07:16.379
I just--

07:16.379 --> 07:19.540
I think it would be best
if you moved on.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.209
( scoffs )

07:28.420 --> 07:30.790
You don't think I can stay
out of trouble, do you?

07:33.079 --> 07:35.290
The further away you are,

07:35.290 --> 07:37.829
the less likely something
would befall Gwynn.

07:40.290 --> 07:42.329
Good night, Captain.

07:42.329 --> 07:46.170
Pardon me.

07:46.170 --> 07:49.040
Lady Gwynn Calkussar
requests the pleasure
of your company tomorrow...

07:49.040 --> 07:53.120
...for tea.
Shall I tell her
you will attend?

07:53.120 --> 07:56.040
Tell Lady Calkussar
I would be pleased to attend.

08:02.250 --> 08:03.579
Looks like you're stuck
with me.

08:34.379 --> 08:35.789
Hmm.

08:37.710 --> 08:39.830
Why exactly
are we doing this?

08:39.830 --> 08:42.620
We were volunteered.

08:42.620 --> 08:46.879
How could I be a volunteer
if I didn't want to come?

08:46.879 --> 08:50.169
You know what, Munt?
About some things,
you're extremely profound.

08:50.169 --> 08:52.539
This all gives me the jeebies.

08:52.539 --> 08:54.960
Don't you even wonder
how this happens, Munt?

08:54.960 --> 08:58.289
How people are suddenly turning
into these night creatures?

08:58.289 --> 09:02.080
This isn't in the almanacs.
This-- this is something new.

09:04.830 --> 09:07.879
It's a witch's curse.

09:07.879 --> 09:11.210
When a man looks upon a witch
with unnatural urges

09:11.210 --> 09:14.669
regarding her... private parts,

09:14.669 --> 09:17.000
it's at night--
turns Plagueling.

09:19.039 --> 09:21.460
- So, this woman?
- Hmm.

09:21.460 --> 09:25.669
You think she was yearning
for some witch-teets

09:25.669 --> 09:28.710
and that's why she turned?

09:28.710 --> 09:32.919
Some women prefer women.
It's not unheard of.

09:34.710 --> 09:37.500
I've seen it.
( exhales )

09:37.500 --> 09:39.330
( chuckles )

09:39.330 --> 09:42.000
You are a treasure trove
of knowledge, my big friend.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.419
Munt, I need your help.

09:44.419 --> 09:48.500
- I need this arm as a specimen.
- Oh, come on, Janzo.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.460
Come on,
don't be so squeamish.
I've seen you do worse.

09:50.460 --> 09:54.120
Oh, with this?

09:54.120 --> 09:56.120
Yes, and don't make
a mess of it.

09:56.120 --> 10:00.960
A mess? Says the man who wants
a rotting Plagueling's arm.

10:00.960 --> 10:02.539
( grunts )

10:02.539 --> 10:04.500
Anything else?

10:04.500 --> 10:08.210
Nope.
That's all, thank you.

10:12.620 --> 10:15.379
Hey. Hey, you tricked me.

10:15.379 --> 10:17.330
You told me that Talon
was going to be a part of this.

10:17.330 --> 10:20.169
You tricked yourself.
Don't let her manipulate you.

10:20.169 --> 10:22.169
Talon doesn't manipulate.
She's perfect.

10:25.080 --> 10:26.960
She's dangerous.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.960
Best keep your distance,
Janzo.

10:44.379 --> 10:45.960
My lady's expecting you.

11:01.669 --> 11:05.210
Oh, good, Talon.
Thank you so much for coming.

11:05.210 --> 11:08.289
( scoffs )
When was the last time
you took a bath?

11:08.289 --> 11:12.500
Oh, it's, uh--
it's been a while.

11:12.500 --> 11:15.379
- Lilly, draw Talon a bath.
- Uh...

11:15.379 --> 11:16.879
No, it's okay.
We'll get you out
of these filthy rags.

11:16.879 --> 11:20.210
No.

11:20.210 --> 11:24.080
Really? You don't strike me
as someone who's timid.

11:24.080 --> 11:27.169
Besides, it would be rude
and absurd to refuse
my hospitality

11:27.169 --> 11:29.500
after everything
we've been through.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.879
A good soak
will do you wonders.

11:31.879 --> 11:34.710
We're all women here.
Go on.

11:51.460 --> 11:53.500
Oh, and rose petals, Lilly.

11:53.500 --> 11:55.039
As many as you have.

11:55.039 --> 11:57.039
Yes, ma'am.

12:19.620 --> 12:23.879
See? Isn't it blissful?

12:23.879 --> 12:25.710
I could get used to it.

12:25.710 --> 12:29.250
I wanted to thank you

12:29.250 --> 12:33.080
for your inestimable service
you rendered me the other night.

12:33.080 --> 12:35.710
It pales in comparison
to what you did for me.

12:35.710 --> 12:39.879
We did for each other
what we were incapable
of doing for ourselves.

12:39.879 --> 12:41.419
We make good partners.

12:51.289 --> 12:53.750
I can manage that by myself.

12:53.750 --> 12:54.919
It's her job.
She's quite good at it.

12:54.919 --> 12:56.879
I don't care.

12:56.879 --> 12:58.710
No one bathes me but me.

13:07.080 --> 13:09.500
I do hope I'm not being
too forward when I ask why

13:09.500 --> 13:11.789
you risked so much
on my behalf?

13:11.789 --> 13:14.539
I could ask you
the same thing.

13:14.539 --> 13:18.500
Very well.
I'll go first.

13:18.500 --> 13:20.120
I could not let you die

13:20.120 --> 13:22.000
for actions
that served my purpose,

13:22.000 --> 13:25.330
even if you had
ulterior motivation.

13:25.330 --> 13:27.120
You had other reasons,
I suspect.

13:28.330 --> 13:29.710
He murdered my family.

13:31.710 --> 13:33.289
Oh, dear.

13:34.919 --> 13:36.330
I'm so sorry.

13:39.500 --> 13:42.080
Uh, Lilly, burn those.

13:42.080 --> 13:45.419
- No, I need those.
- Of course you don't.
  Burn them.

13:45.419 --> 13:49.580
- Not the jacket, please.
- Sentimental value?

13:52.960 --> 13:55.580
Fine, not the jacket.

13:55.580 --> 13:58.169
It does have a certain
dauntless quality
that suits you quite well.

14:02.750 --> 14:04.539
Why are you doing all this?

14:04.539 --> 14:08.500
I'm only doing what I can
to show my gratitude.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.750
Okay, well,
now we can call it even.

14:10.750 --> 14:14.419
( scoffs )
Calling it even is such
a vulgar notion.

14:14.419 --> 14:15.960
We're friends now.

14:15.960 --> 14:18.000
We're two women
in a world of men.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.580
Each has
what the other is lacking,

14:19.580 --> 14:21.250
but together, we have it all.

14:21.250 --> 14:24.620
You have the brawn
and I have the brains.

14:24.620 --> 14:27.000
Oh, please, do go on.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.080
We're like fire and ice,
you and I.

14:29.080 --> 14:30.580
Fire and ice
destroy each other.

14:30.580 --> 14:32.919
( scoffs )
Don't be difficult.

14:32.919 --> 14:35.580
I'm offering you
my friendship.

14:39.210 --> 14:42.789
I've been on my own
such a long time.

14:42.789 --> 14:45.250
It's hard for me
to trust people.

14:45.250 --> 14:46.419
We'll take our time then.

14:53.460 --> 14:56.330
You came to the Outpost
to defeat Toru Magmoor.

14:56.330 --> 14:57.960
He's dead now.

14:57.960 --> 15:01.789
I do hope that means
you're not leaving soon.

15:01.789 --> 15:04.379
I still have a few things
I need to do here.

15:04.379 --> 15:05.620
Something less vengeful,
I hope.

15:07.289 --> 15:09.620
Lilly:
Supper is ready, ma'am.

15:09.620 --> 15:12.460
For our next visit,
we will play the game
of trading secrets

15:12.460 --> 15:15.879
until we know everything
about each other.

15:15.879 --> 15:18.620
When you've soaked long enough,
Lilly will help you dress.

15:18.620 --> 15:22.250
I'll see you at supper.

15:22.250 --> 15:24.120
I don't have anything
to wear to supper.

15:26.830 --> 15:30.379
I think the yellow one.

15:30.379 --> 15:31.750
The yellow what?

15:42.460 --> 15:43.460
Ugh!

15:52.500 --> 15:54.080
Evening, my lady.

15:54.080 --> 15:56.669
I'm not a lady.
I am just like you.

15:56.669 --> 15:59.500
I have no money, no title,
and nothing much in life
to look forward to.

15:59.500 --> 16:03.039
I beg your pardon!
I have many things
to look forward to.

16:06.289 --> 16:08.620
Of course, I'm sorry.

16:08.620 --> 16:12.580
It's just this bloody dress
is so tight.

16:12.580 --> 16:17.879
It's pushing up my chest
like two pounds of flour
in a one-pound sack.

16:17.879 --> 16:22.460
- Just forget I said anything.
- ( snarling )

16:22.460 --> 16:24.419
( growling )

16:27.669 --> 16:28.919
( screaming )

16:32.419 --> 16:33.419
( laughter )

16:38.539 --> 16:41.080
( catcalling )

16:42.120 --> 16:43.919
Whoo!

16:43.919 --> 16:45.919
( catcalls continue )

16:49.039 --> 16:50.789
Sweet mother's milk.

16:50.789 --> 16:53.500
I haven't seen a hussy
turn heads like that

16:53.500 --> 16:55.710
since Tikka's gown
snagged on a coat hook,

16:55.710 --> 16:58.539
and you're fully clothed.

16:58.539 --> 17:03.080
Do you dance?
Men would pay dearly
to see you dance.

17:03.080 --> 17:04.710
And men would also pay dearly

17:04.710 --> 17:07.289
to see me pull out your tongue
and tie it around your neck.

17:10.579 --> 17:13.250
Well, if you change your mind,
you know where to find me.

17:15.618 --> 17:17.380
I am looking for work.

17:19.380 --> 17:21.579
Really?

17:21.579 --> 17:24.750
- Well, bless my gourds.
- I could help Janzo--

17:24.750 --> 17:26.618
running drinks,
clearing tables,

17:26.618 --> 17:28.170
serving the men
that come here.

17:28.170 --> 17:30.170
Dressed like that
or in those rags.

17:30.170 --> 17:32.079
In whatever
I damn well please.

17:32.079 --> 17:35.579
Well, you better damn well
please to earn the money

17:35.579 --> 17:37.579
to pay for the repairs
to your window

17:37.579 --> 17:39.579
and wall in your room.

17:39.579 --> 17:41.789
- Yeah, about that--
- I don't care how it happened.

17:41.789 --> 17:43.539
Pay it back
starting tomorrow.

17:43.539 --> 17:47.329
You get three meals, a room,
and whatever miserly tips

17:47.329 --> 17:49.380
you can coax out
of the patrons you serve.

17:49.380 --> 17:53.670
And to do that,
I suggest you wear that dress.

18:05.210 --> 18:07.880
Someone left this for you,
mama.

18:10.210 --> 18:12.170
It's a bit ripe.

18:14.619 --> 18:16.500
Oh, sweet mother!

18:16.500 --> 18:18.289
What is it?

18:18.289 --> 18:19.329
( gasps )

18:19.329 --> 18:21.789
It's Bill.

18:21.789 --> 18:25.750
Who would do this?

18:25.750 --> 18:28.000
Worm would do this,

18:28.000 --> 18:30.250
and he's going to
pay for it.

18:30.250 --> 18:33.079
I'm sorry, mama.

18:33.079 --> 18:36.250
I was grooming that boy
to take over.

18:36.250 --> 18:39.539
Who's going to take care of
things when I retire now?

18:39.539 --> 18:42.670
- What about me?
- The fact that you
  brought this in here

18:42.670 --> 18:46.210
without checking first
to see what it was
is the reason why.

18:46.210 --> 18:49.250
- I don't understand.
- Exactly. Now get your
  brother's head out of here.

18:52.329 --> 18:53.829
Come on, Bill.

18:53.829 --> 18:56.539
- What's that?
- Bill's head.

18:56.539 --> 18:59.500
- Mum, was that Bill?
  Or part of Bill?
- Oh, yes.

18:59.500 --> 19:02.079
Yes.

19:02.079 --> 19:05.039
- Bill's dead?
- No, no, no.
  He just lost his body.

19:05.039 --> 19:08.039
Yes, of course he's dead,
you moron!

19:08.039 --> 19:11.829
- Mommy, that was your son.
- No, he was not my son.

19:11.829 --> 19:13.750
He was adopted,
like all of you,

19:13.750 --> 19:15.460
and I didn't really
like him much anyway.

19:19.380 --> 19:23.289
Clearly this is a message
from the Worm.

19:23.289 --> 19:26.250
He's cutting us off.

19:29.500 --> 19:32.880
Haven't seen a greyskin
over these walls in 11 years.

19:32.880 --> 19:36.170
What I don't get
is why it dragged her
halfway across town.

19:39.710 --> 19:43.079
And then it runs off
back to the Outlands

19:43.079 --> 19:46.119
and no one sees
a damn thing.

19:46.119 --> 19:49.829
Since when did a greyskin
go unnoticed?

19:52.710 --> 19:56.500
Follow the blood trail
back to where she was killed.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.880
Look for tracks,
marks, anything.

20:14.539 --> 20:16.119
( thud )

20:24.119 --> 20:28.460
Fancy explaining
why there's a dead body
underneath your window?

20:31.920 --> 20:34.750
- Coincidence.
- Come down here.

20:34.750 --> 20:36.789
Let's have a little chin wag.

20:44.829 --> 20:47.170
( gasps )

20:47.170 --> 20:48.750
You know this woman?

20:48.750 --> 20:52.380
No, I don't.

20:52.380 --> 20:54.000
Who is she?

20:54.000 --> 20:58.619
Probably just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

20:58.619 --> 21:03.170
Greyskins aren't particular
about who they kill
as long as they're human.

21:03.170 --> 21:05.960
Think it was a greyskin?

21:05.960 --> 21:07.000
So why are you talking to me?

21:07.000 --> 21:08.329
Ah, no reason.

21:08.329 --> 21:11.880
Just a ravaged dead woman
under your window.

21:11.880 --> 21:14.920
Any idea why that might be?

21:14.920 --> 21:17.039
Don't know.

21:17.039 --> 21:20.960
When I was a boy,
there was this mangy cat.

21:20.960 --> 21:23.539
I used to feed it
bits and bobs.
You know, scraps.

21:23.539 --> 21:26.210
It fancied me
as a bit of a mate.

21:26.210 --> 21:28.829
Anyway, this stupid moggy

21:28.829 --> 21:32.420
started leaving me presents
on me back step.

21:32.420 --> 21:34.460
Half a chewed up mouse,
a dead bird.

21:34.460 --> 21:37.000
So you think I have
a greyskin as a pet?

21:37.000 --> 21:41.380
- Brings me its victims?
- No, that'd be ridiculous.
  Unfathomable.

21:41.380 --> 21:46.380
Like a commander's daughter
who suddenly has the power
to pardon a murderer.

21:47.710 --> 21:50.460
Unfathomable,

21:50.460 --> 21:53.829
like a girl with blood
as black as ink.

21:53.829 --> 21:56.750
You going somewhere
with this, Marshal?

21:56.750 --> 21:59.829
When you left
Magmoor for dead,

21:59.829 --> 22:02.670
he left a message
written in his own blood.

22:02.670 --> 22:06.250
It said,
"Tell Dred one remains."

22:06.250 --> 22:09.079
What's that mean to you?

22:09.079 --> 22:10.920
Nothing.

22:13.119 --> 22:14.670
You know what I think?

22:17.920 --> 22:20.119
I think the one remains
is you.

22:22.420 --> 22:23.920
What do you want from me?

22:23.920 --> 22:27.880
I want you to leave the Outpost
and never come back.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.960
Let the Prime Order
hunt you elsewhere.

22:29.960 --> 22:32.619
They shouldn't be hunting me
in the first place.

22:32.619 --> 22:35.250
Oh, but they will.
You see, I've already left word

22:35.250 --> 22:39.250
for the Prime Order,
to Everit Dred himself, so...

22:39.250 --> 22:41.960
it's only a matter of time
before they come looking.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.420
Good.
Then let them come.

23:07.960 --> 23:10.210
That demon thing
killed someone last night.

23:10.210 --> 23:11.960
Only one?

23:11.960 --> 23:14.039
I told you the Lu-Qiri
would kill.

23:14.039 --> 23:19.670
It'll happen again
if you don't banish it back
through the portal.

23:19.670 --> 23:22.039
Well, that's why I'm here.

23:22.039 --> 23:24.079
Teach me how to do that.
I can't let it kill again.

23:24.079 --> 23:26.210
You don't need a teacher.

23:26.210 --> 23:29.250
You already know everything
that's necessary to do
what's required.

23:33.329 --> 23:36.619
Stop.
Just stop with the circular
crazy talk for once.

23:36.619 --> 23:38.210
Bellows.

23:47.750 --> 23:51.829
Okay, let's just say
you have this one moment
to explain everything to me,

23:51.829 --> 23:54.880
to tell me as simply as possible
how I can get rid of this--

23:54.880 --> 23:58.420
this thing, whatever it is.

23:58.420 --> 24:00.380
- Can you do that?
- Yes.

24:00.380 --> 24:03.710
Then in one sentence,
how do I get rid of it?

24:03.710 --> 24:06.829
Command the demon Baphnoro
to return to the plane
of shadow and ash.

24:06.829 --> 24:08.750
( scoffs )

24:08.750 --> 24:11.710
Of course!
'Cause everyone knows that.

24:11.710 --> 24:13.619
Not everyone. Only you.

24:13.619 --> 24:15.829
It's in that
black blood of yours.

24:15.829 --> 24:19.710
So I just have to tell it
what you said,

24:19.710 --> 24:22.579
- and it'll just obey me?
- Probably not. It hates you.

24:22.579 --> 24:25.000
( sniffing )

24:25.000 --> 24:26.289
What's that smell?

24:26.289 --> 24:28.000
( sniffs )

24:28.000 --> 24:30.920
- Smell?
- It smells of...

24:30.920 --> 24:32.920
citrus and lavender?

24:32.920 --> 24:36.619
Oh. That's me.

24:36.619 --> 24:38.119
I had a bath.

24:41.210 --> 24:43.789
( sniffing )
I thought something
was different.

24:43.789 --> 24:46.880
You no longer smell
of excrement. It suits you.

24:46.880 --> 24:49.789
Look, can we just get back to
why the demon hates me?

24:49.789 --> 24:52.619
The plane of ashes where
the Lu-Qiri have been banished

24:52.619 --> 24:56.079
is a place of pain
and anguish.

24:56.079 --> 24:57.829
Baphnoro won't return there

24:57.829 --> 25:01.289
unless he is commanded
to do so forcibly by you,

25:01.289 --> 25:04.420
a Blackblood, without fear,

25:04.420 --> 25:06.500
without hesitation
or self-doubt.

25:06.500 --> 25:08.960
But why would it obey me,
of all people?

25:08.960 --> 25:12.460
The blood in your veins
comes from the Gezzekhan,

25:12.460 --> 25:13.880
their Lord Emperor.

25:13.880 --> 25:17.380
The Lu-Qiri follow
an absolute line of authority.

25:17.380 --> 25:19.579
- So it has to obey me?
- Yes.

25:19.579 --> 25:20.960
Well, why didn't you
just say that?

25:20.960 --> 25:24.039
Because for an impudent,
impatient little twit

25:24.039 --> 25:26.579
such as yourself,
it won't be that simple.

25:26.579 --> 25:29.500
No one's ever said
such nice things about me.

25:29.500 --> 25:33.460
You must try
to control your impulses,

25:33.460 --> 25:36.460
to be patient,
to clear your mind,

25:36.460 --> 25:39.039
or you won't be able
to banish the Lu-Qiri.

25:39.039 --> 25:42.079
- I can do that.
- I don't think you can.

25:42.079 --> 25:47.460
Not yet.
You must stop thinking about
how to make him go away

25:47.460 --> 25:50.670
and simply command it
to do so,

25:50.670 --> 25:54.000
without self doubt,
without distraction,

25:54.000 --> 25:55.079
without fear.

25:55.079 --> 25:57.289
Can you do that, Talon?

25:57.289 --> 25:59.880
I don't know.

25:59.880 --> 26:01.880
Well, you'd better.

26:01.880 --> 26:04.539
'Cause you're the only one
in this world who can.

26:07.880 --> 26:10.250
Any kind of idea
what could have done this?

26:11.829 --> 26:15.079
I don't know.
Why are you asking me?

26:20.289 --> 26:21.829
Because, um...

26:25.289 --> 26:27.039
because you've seen a lot more
than I have.

26:31.210 --> 26:34.460
You think it's a greyskin?

26:34.460 --> 26:37.460
You hate this, don't you?

26:38.670 --> 26:41.960
Having to call me
for answers?

26:41.960 --> 26:46.119
Answers that I have because
I went and did the one thing

26:46.119 --> 26:49.289
that you didn't
want me to do,

26:49.289 --> 26:51.289
become a soldier.

26:53.289 --> 26:55.119
You sound mighty proud
for a boy

26:55.119 --> 26:57.170
who follows around
Calkussar the Betrayer

26:57.170 --> 26:59.750
like one of his dogs.

26:59.750 --> 27:03.039
- Don't call him that.
- "The Betrayer"?

27:03.039 --> 27:05.039
That's what he is.

27:05.039 --> 27:07.170
Opened up the gates
and let in the Prime Order

27:07.170 --> 27:08.670
to kill his own king.

27:08.670 --> 27:13.329
He knows more of loyalty
and sacrifice

27:13.329 --> 27:15.380
then you ever will.

27:19.880 --> 27:21.670
Is it a greyskin or not?

27:21.670 --> 27:23.380
Could be.

27:25.750 --> 27:28.670
Obviously,
it was very strong
to have done this.

27:30.960 --> 27:34.170
There's something
I should tell you.

27:34.170 --> 27:37.000
I killed a Plagueling
inside the walls.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.500
- What? When?
- Yesterday.

27:39.500 --> 27:41.329
On my way to the bathhouse.

27:41.329 --> 27:43.539
You have one job,
to keep them out!

27:43.539 --> 27:49.380
It was Kell.

27:49.380 --> 27:52.460
That runt from Nordejor
you used to run around with

27:52.460 --> 27:55.750
getting in trouble as a kid?

27:55.750 --> 27:57.289
You should have told me
right away.

27:57.289 --> 27:58.289
I know.

28:00.380 --> 28:05.210
I know. I just--
I thought-- hoped...

28:05.210 --> 28:08.079
that it was
an isolated incident.

28:08.079 --> 28:11.789
I didn't want to set
the city in a panic.

28:11.789 --> 28:16.210
Well, you weren't wrong
about that.

28:16.210 --> 28:19.380
Plaguelings start showing up,
we'll have a revolt
on the streets.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.960
Who wants one?
( chuckles )

28:34.829 --> 28:37.670
Oh, sorry,
let me get that for you.

28:42.420 --> 28:44.619
Are you looking for a man?

28:44.619 --> 28:46.460
( laughing )

28:46.460 --> 28:48.000
- Oh!
- ( laughter )

28:48.000 --> 28:49.750
You're not my type.

28:54.880 --> 28:56.829
Think I was just proposed to.

28:56.829 --> 29:00.670
Somehow I don't see you content
to be a miner's wife.

29:00.670 --> 29:02.880
I mean, how much worse
can it get?

29:02.880 --> 29:05.039
Come on,
it's not that bad.

29:05.039 --> 29:07.880
What are you searching for,
anyway?

29:07.880 --> 29:09.880
- What?
- The arms.

29:09.880 --> 29:12.210
You keep checking all the arms
of all the men in here.

29:12.210 --> 29:14.460
Maybe I can help.

29:16.880 --> 29:19.079
I don't know
what you're talking about.

29:19.079 --> 29:23.079
You can trust me.
I've never told anyone else
your other secrets.

29:25.250 --> 29:27.039
I'm looking for a tattoo.

29:27.039 --> 29:29.960
A double cross of bones,
same one Toru Magmoor had.

29:32.079 --> 29:33.460
He told me one of his friends
is in town.

29:33.460 --> 29:36.460
You're not going
to kill him.

29:36.460 --> 29:39.079
No, I just want to ask him
a few questions.

29:39.079 --> 29:41.079
Right.
Well, I'll keep my eyes open,

29:41.079 --> 29:43.619
and if I see him,
I'll grab him.

29:46.460 --> 29:47.920
Did I mention
he's a murdering bastard

29:47.920 --> 29:49.119
who would slit
both our throats

29:49.119 --> 29:51.710
if he knew we were
looking for him?

29:51.710 --> 29:56.710
No. No, you didn't
mention that. Right.

29:56.710 --> 29:59.289
Well, in that case,
if I see the mark,

29:59.289 --> 30:01.539
I'll let you know...

30:03.539 --> 30:05.750
...without letting on
that I know.

30:05.750 --> 30:07.710
Without letting on
that I know

30:07.710 --> 30:10.500
that I let you know
that I know.

30:26.039 --> 30:29.039
( indistinct chatter )

30:39.170 --> 30:41.000
Evening, Worm.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.920
What'll it be?

30:44.960 --> 30:47.380
Did you enjoy my little gift?

30:50.539 --> 30:51.750
Busy night.

30:53.539 --> 30:56.079
That's good,

30:56.079 --> 30:59.829
because you're out
of the colipsum business.

30:59.829 --> 31:01.829
You know why
they call you the Worm?

31:01.829 --> 31:05.000
On account of this tiny,
tiny body part of yours

31:05.000 --> 31:06.880
which resembles a worm.

31:06.880 --> 31:08.619
( laughter )

31:08.619 --> 31:11.670
You're a small-time
tavern wench

31:11.670 --> 31:16.000
with no power
outside that door.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.670
Keep looking over
your shoulder, Worm.

31:19.789 --> 31:21.119
Likewise.

31:23.119 --> 31:24.710
( grunting )

31:39.329 --> 31:41.579
I can only imagine
the look on his face

31:41.579 --> 31:43.210
when he had to let her go.

31:43.210 --> 31:44.420
It was exhilarating,

31:44.420 --> 31:46.000
but not something
I'd like to repeat.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.789
Nor would I.

31:48.789 --> 31:51.210
Marshal,
how dare you spy on us.

31:53.380 --> 31:56.619
I'm not spying on you.

31:56.619 --> 31:57.920
Come to make you an offer.

31:57.920 --> 31:59.460
( chuckles )

31:59.460 --> 32:01.920
I doubt there's anything you
have to offer me, Marshal.

32:01.920 --> 32:05.920
I know you've got a secret,

32:05.920 --> 32:07.420
and you want it kept that way.

32:07.420 --> 32:11.880
Lilly, Sergeant,
I'll only need a moment.

32:11.880 --> 32:13.500
Our orders are not
to leave your side.

32:13.500 --> 32:16.460
Oh, well,
I have Marshal Wythers
to protect me.

32:18.380 --> 32:20.329
You will explain
yourself at once.

32:20.329 --> 32:24.250
I will not have you insinuating
without an explicit accusation.

32:24.250 --> 32:27.250
I'm not making
any explicit accusations,

32:27.250 --> 32:31.380
although you certainly
took the bait rather well.

32:31.380 --> 32:35.119
How dare you!
Of course I have secrets.

32:35.119 --> 32:38.829
- What woman doesn't?
- What are you hiding?

32:38.829 --> 32:42.420
My girlish little secrets
aren't worth your trouble,
Marshal.

32:42.420 --> 32:48.079
Then tell me,
why would a base commander

32:48.079 --> 32:50.750
defer to the will
of a little girl?

32:50.750 --> 32:54.880
That?
That's your precious riddle?

32:54.880 --> 32:57.119
Then what's the answer?

32:57.119 --> 33:00.079
Clearly you've never
had a daughter, Marshal.

33:00.079 --> 33:01.710
Most of us can manipulate
our daddies

33:01.710 --> 33:04.500
into pretty much anything
we set our hearts on.

33:17.829 --> 33:20.539
Gwynn? Lilly told me.

33:20.539 --> 33:23.380
- He suspects something.
- No, no, he would never cross
  Commander Calkussar.

33:23.380 --> 33:25.329
Isn't that exactly
what he just did?

33:25.329 --> 33:28.500
No. No, he hates
an unsolved riddle.

33:28.500 --> 33:31.329
When I was a boy,
I would hear him up at night

33:31.329 --> 33:34.380
pacing and breaking things
if he couldn't solve the case.

33:34.380 --> 33:36.289
He can't let go.

33:39.329 --> 33:42.460
We can't do this anymore.

33:42.460 --> 33:44.670
Your father saw us, Gwynn.

33:44.670 --> 33:46.420
So what?

33:46.420 --> 33:49.619
- He doesn't control me.
- No, but he controls me.

33:49.619 --> 33:51.789
He's my commander.

33:51.789 --> 33:55.170
Don't push me away.
I'll talk to him.

33:55.170 --> 33:57.960
He's right.
We can never be together.

33:57.960 --> 34:00.380
I'm a common soldier

34:00.380 --> 34:04.079
born to a washer woman
and a watchman.

34:04.079 --> 34:06.079
Who your parents are
doesn't matter to me.

34:06.079 --> 34:11.579
I swore an oath
to protect you at all costs,

34:11.579 --> 34:15.710
and I plan to,
even if it's from myself.

34:15.710 --> 34:18.250
Garret?

34:18.250 --> 34:19.539
Garret!

34:31.380 --> 34:32.619
( sighs )

34:32.619 --> 34:36.380
Bits of copper.

34:38.579 --> 34:40.880
He called me a tavern wench.

34:42.920 --> 34:44.210
That's what I am.

34:44.210 --> 34:49.210
Have some.
It keeps the wolves at bay.

34:49.210 --> 34:52.170
You could have disagreed
with me.

34:52.170 --> 34:55.329
I think you've done
very well, mum.

34:55.329 --> 34:58.420
Very well? Is that
what you think I want?

34:58.420 --> 34:59.579
To do very well?

34:59.579 --> 35:01.170
No, I want that.

35:04.789 --> 35:05.920
You want the map?

35:05.920 --> 35:08.210
Do I want the map?

35:08.210 --> 35:12.000
You heaving sack of-- catch!

35:12.000 --> 35:16.420
I don't want the map.
I want the whole damn world.

35:16.420 --> 35:18.380
Or at least
a really good part of it.

35:18.380 --> 35:21.460
How is that even possible?

35:21.460 --> 35:24.829
Colipsum, my boy.

35:24.829 --> 35:26.750
We need colipsum.

35:26.750 --> 35:29.960
What if we just
increase ale exports?

35:29.960 --> 35:33.670
All right, yes, yes, yes!
Colipsum.

35:33.670 --> 35:35.119
Who has some?

35:35.119 --> 35:37.750
The Worm.

35:37.750 --> 35:39.250
He knows the only supplier
of colipsum

35:39.250 --> 35:40.710
this side of the realm.

35:40.710 --> 35:43.920
I need to be the Worm.

35:43.920 --> 35:47.250
His secrets
need to be my secrets.

35:47.250 --> 35:48.500
I'm going to get you
another drink.

35:48.500 --> 35:51.000
I don't want another drink!

35:51.000 --> 35:53.119
Have some ambition,
for God's sake.

35:53.119 --> 35:55.880
I would eat glass to get
the name of that supplier.

35:55.880 --> 35:58.500
Do you understand me?

35:58.500 --> 36:00.039
For once
in your miserable life,

36:00.039 --> 36:02.500
just do one thing
for your mother.

36:02.500 --> 36:04.380
- It's all I want.
- Okay.

36:08.880 --> 36:10.880
Is that his overcoat?

36:19.500 --> 36:21.789
Weirdo. Never mind.

36:21.789 --> 36:25.079
Go get me Munt.

36:25.079 --> 36:28.460
There's dark deeds
need doing.

36:30.500 --> 36:31.579
Birds.

36:33.420 --> 36:35.619
Birds.

37:01.619 --> 37:03.170
( grunts )

37:21.119 --> 37:23.119
Garret: Excuse me,
you can't be up here!

37:28.500 --> 37:29.920
Hello, Talon.

37:33.750 --> 37:35.119
What are you doing up here?

37:35.119 --> 37:40.170
I, um, couldn't sleep.
Needed some air.

37:40.170 --> 37:41.920
Well, it's nearly dawn.

37:41.920 --> 37:43.789
It's far too late
for a barmaid to be up.

37:43.789 --> 37:46.380
And far too early
for a captain.

37:46.380 --> 37:50.579
- What's your excuse?
- I'm on duty.

37:50.579 --> 37:55.539
If it's any comfort,
I'm not up here to cause
any trouble.

37:55.539 --> 37:59.380
Yeah, about that, I, uh--

37:59.380 --> 38:02.960
I didn't mean to imply...

38:02.960 --> 38:05.380
It's just if you would
tell me more about yourself

38:05.380 --> 38:07.960
- and what you're doing--
- What's there to tell?

38:07.960 --> 38:11.289
I'm a barmaid, like you said.

38:11.289 --> 38:15.210
A barmaid with
exceptional combat skills.

38:15.210 --> 38:18.000
I still can't understand how
you killed Captain Magmoor.

38:19.880 --> 38:23.210
Why? Because I'm a woman?

38:23.210 --> 38:25.000
No.

38:26.039 --> 38:29.710
Partly, yes.

38:29.710 --> 38:32.329
And also the fact
that he's twice your size

38:32.329 --> 38:33.539
and a legendary swordsman.

38:33.539 --> 38:36.079
I'm not sure
I could have beaten him.

38:36.079 --> 38:38.460
I could show you.

38:38.460 --> 38:41.000
I'm not sure
that's necessary.

38:45.000 --> 38:47.670
Men like you
underestimate me.

38:51.670 --> 38:53.710
I won't let
my guard down again.

38:53.710 --> 38:55.920
Good.

38:55.920 --> 38:59.670
Then maybe you'll be
a decent match...

38:59.670 --> 39:01.460
for a sparring partner,
that is.

39:02.670 --> 39:04.880
Sounds dangerous.

39:04.880 --> 39:07.039
You really think you could
last a few rounds with me?

39:07.039 --> 39:10.460
Oh, I think I could last
more than a few rounds.

39:10.460 --> 39:14.039
I don't think so.
I'd wear you out.

39:17.250 --> 39:18.670
Man: Captain?

39:26.460 --> 39:28.670
I have a greyskin count,
Captain.

39:28.670 --> 39:29.670
Thank you, Sergeant.

39:34.079 --> 39:37.170
Seriously,
you can't be up here.

39:54.960 --> 39:56.329
( clears throat )

39:59.710 --> 40:01.119
Send him in.

40:13.710 --> 40:18.329
Pleased to see you
in good health, old friend.

40:18.329 --> 40:24.210
Your men interrupted
a very expensive game,
Ambassador Dred.

40:24.210 --> 40:25.829
I hope you had good reason.

40:25.829 --> 40:27.619
Your friend Magmoor is dead.

40:32.420 --> 40:34.960
Toru's not my problem anymore.

40:34.960 --> 40:37.539
He left the Bones
to work for you.

40:37.539 --> 40:38.789
Good riddance.

40:39.789 --> 40:43.000
"Tell Dred one remains."

40:43.000 --> 40:44.079
One what?

40:44.079 --> 40:47.539
What one thing could remain

40:47.539 --> 40:51.119
of such importance
that Toru would write it down

40:51.119 --> 40:54.750
in his own dying blood?

40:54.750 --> 40:57.619
It's impossible.

40:57.619 --> 40:59.289
We killed them all.
You were there.

40:59.289 --> 41:02.579
- I checked every corpse.
- Save your excuses.

41:02.579 --> 41:04.670
Gather the Bones.

41:04.670 --> 41:07.250
Ride at once
for Gallwood Outpost.

41:07.250 --> 41:10.000
If a Blackblood remains,

41:10.000 --> 41:12.670
kill it and bring me the head.

41:12.670 --> 41:14.619
It's a waste of time.

41:14.619 --> 41:17.579
Won't be anything there.

41:17.579 --> 41:21.000
I'm happy to confirm it
for you for the right price.

41:24.170 --> 41:29.170
The right price
is that you and your men

41:29.170 --> 41:32.329
do not suffer
the slowest death imaginable

41:32.329 --> 41:34.539
at the hands
of the Inquisitor.

41:37.329 --> 41:41.170
Well, there is no greater
reward than that, is there?

41:41.170 --> 41:43.789
Don't fail.
