42:16.193 --> 42:17.890
And so is Juice.

42:34.295 --> 42:35.495
(sighs)

42:39.744 --> 42:41.431
_

42:41.456 --> 42:43.757
(children shrieking with joy)

42:43.782 --> 42:46.599
<i>- ♪ (carnival music) ♪
- ♪ (ominous flourish) ♪</i>

42:58.481 --> 43:00.078
<i>♪ (carnival music fades) ♪</i>

43:04.063 --> 43:06.063
<i>♪ (echoed chimes) ♪</i>

43:11.679 --> 43:13.196
I loved him.

43:14.907 --> 43:16.107
(chuckles)

43:17.350 --> 43:19.007
In spite of what he did.

43:28.146 --> 43:32.016
(crying) Did it make me...
(whispered) fucked up?

43:33.743 --> 43:35.189
Like perverse?

43:35.296 --> 43:37.687
(crying) Just a total fuckin' hypocrite.

43:38.969 --> 43:40.169
(Ferguson) No.

43:40.194 --> 43:44.283
(Kaz sobbing)

43:44.308 --> 43:47.721
It's possible to love
and hate at the same time.

43:48.091 --> 43:52.626
(Kaz continues sobbing)

43:52.651 --> 43:54.286
(Kaz gasping)

43:54.311 --> 44:01.108
(Kaz sobbing)

44:01.133 --> 44:04.367
(Kaz gasping and sniffling)

44:04.391 --> 44:06.012
(whispered) I'll never leave you.

44:08.739 --> 44:10.123
_

44:10.148 --> 44:12.176
(Ferguson) <i>You know there's
been a shift away from Bea Smith</i>

44:12.201 --> 44:13.542
<i>while she's been in the slot.</i>

44:14.012 --> 44:15.012
(Kaz) <i>Yeah.</i>

44:15.037 --> 44:16.170
(Ferguson) <i>You should capitalise on it.</i>

44:16.195 --> 44:18.702
- How?
- Divide and conquer.

44:21.448 --> 44:23.163
You've been a great right hand.

44:23.188 --> 44:24.672
Bea's still boss but, hey?

44:25.362 --> 44:26.614
(Doreen) What if you take over?

44:26.639 --> 44:28.903
You don't want Bea to
hear you talkin' like that.

44:31.518 --> 44:33.702
(Ferguson) <i>Her faith in
Bea Smith is eroding.</i>

44:35.731 --> 44:38.620
- Did I miss something?
- You're just not here for us, Bea.

44:38.645 --> 44:39.845
What?

44:39.870 --> 44:41.532
Everything I do is for you girls, right?

44:42.643 --> 44:44.465
- Right-o, what's up?
- This.

44:48.104 --> 44:49.693
<i>The damage is done.</i>

44:50.258 --> 44:52.464
Excuse me, Governor,
the brawler has arrived.

44:57.151 --> 44:58.631
(indistinct P.A. announcement)

45:00.775 --> 45:06.933
The new season of Wentworth,
8:30 Tuesday, on SoHo.
