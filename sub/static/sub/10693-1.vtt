01:46.958 --> 01:50.406
"...just as Eliza
was majestically removing..."

01:50.625 --> 01:55.282
"...a fifty-pound banknote
from the drawer to her own purse..."

01:55.500 --> 02:00.371
"...we were suddenly interrupted
by old MacDonald himself!"

02:00.583 --> 02:05.157
"We called up all the winning dignity
of our sex to do what must be done."

02:05.375 --> 02:09.830
"Sophia shrieked and fainted, and
I screamed and instantly ran mad."

02:12.167 --> 02:16.326
"Finally, we regained our senses,
escaped and hastened to London."

02:16.542 --> 02:19.705
"We began to think
of returning to our mothers,"

02:19.917 --> 02:23.448
"but accidentally heard
that they had both..."

02:23.667 --> 02:26.499
"...starved to death!"

02:26.708 --> 02:28.035
Fanny!

02:28.250 --> 02:29.743
Goodbye, Susy.

02:29.958 --> 02:33.869
Think of lots of good stories for me
and eat thousands of tarts.

02:34.083 --> 02:38.870
And you, little girl, continue to brush
your hair, but not all off.

02:40.292 --> 02:42.448
Fanny, he's here.

02:46.292 --> 02:49.574
Wake up.
Say goodbye to your sister.

02:53.875 --> 02:57.371
- Sorry for the delay.
- Hurry along, then.

03:02.958 --> 03:06.454
- Goodbye!
- Come on, I ain't got all day.

03:08.708 --> 03:11.197
- Bye!
- Goodbye, Mama.

03:11.417 --> 03:13.324
- Give my regards to my sisters.
- Yes, Mama.

03:13.542 --> 03:17.073
And you will write to tell me
when I'm to return?

03:17.292 --> 03:19.531
Mama?

03:19.750 --> 03:21.326
Get on now!

03:21.542 --> 03:24.623
- Bye!
- Bye, Susy!

03:24.833 --> 03:26.456
Bye!

03:27.417 --> 03:29.289
Bye!

04:12.625 --> 04:14.746
Do you hear that?

04:16.000 --> 04:17.742
Black cargo, Miss.

04:17.958 --> 04:21.370
- Black cargo?
- Aye. Slaves.

04:21.583 --> 04:24.617
Probably some captain
or heroic ship doctor...

04:24.875 --> 04:27.577
...brought home some darkies
as gifts for the wife.

04:29.917 --> 04:31.493
Get on there!

05:22.042 --> 05:24.447
Stand!

05:26.875 --> 05:28.700
Hello!

05:29.583 --> 05:32.617
- Hello!
- It's 5 o'clock in the morning.

05:32.833 --> 05:37.325
A Mrs. Norris arranged
for this girl to be brought here.

05:37.542 --> 05:43.160
- It's her niece or something.
- Mrs. Norris lives in the parsonage.

05:43.375 --> 05:46.954
I was told to drop her
at the entrance of Mansfield Park.

05:47.167 --> 05:49.204
Then drop her.

06:14.167 --> 06:18.907
- You must be my aunt, Aunt Norris.
- Yes, yes...

06:19.125 --> 06:22.242
He brought you two hours too early.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.372
Come in.

06:31.375 --> 06:34.326
Ellis, gather up the children.

06:34.542 --> 06:37.410
Now, let us have a look at you.

06:38.958 --> 06:41.873
Well... I'm sure you have other qualities.

06:42.833 --> 06:46.779
Sir Thomas, she's here.
Our new little charge.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.204
- Hello, Fanny.
- Hello, Sir Thomas.

06:49.417 --> 06:52.996
- Greetings from my family.
- Thank you. How was your journey?

06:53.208 --> 06:55.910
Lovely, sir.
I'd no idea England was so big.

06:56.125 --> 06:58.874
But you came, what?
A hundred miles?

06:59.083 --> 07:02.698
- Yes, sir. Impressive.
- Indeed, it is.

07:02.917 --> 07:07.907
Well, get her settled in with you,
and we'll introduce the children later.

07:08.125 --> 07:10.578
With Mr. Norris and myself?

07:10.792 --> 07:13.909
- Yes... I thought...
- No, no, no.

07:14.125 --> 07:16.032
There's been a misunderstanding.

07:16.250 --> 07:19.698
When I suggested
we take in my poor niece...

07:19.917 --> 07:22.915
Please do not trouble yourself
on my behalf.

07:23.625 --> 07:26.658
You speak when you are spoken to.

07:27.583 --> 07:31.198
Would you excuse us, Miss Price?

08:15.167 --> 08:18.947
Good morning.
I am Maria Elizabeth Bertram.

08:19.167 --> 08:23.575
And I am Julia Frances Bertram.
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

08:23.792 --> 08:26.031
Pleased to meet you.

08:34.417 --> 08:40.082
Mr. Norris could no more tolerate
the noise of a child than he could fly!

08:40.292 --> 08:44.284
But it might not be wise to have her
in the house with the boys.

08:44.500 --> 08:49.999
If you breed her up with them, though
she may have the beauty of an angel,

08:50.208 --> 08:52.329
she'll never be more to either
than a sister.

08:52.542 --> 08:55.540
I suppose there's truth to that.
It's settled.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.496
Maria, Julia, listen...

09:01.167 --> 09:05.705
We must prepare ourselves
for gross ignorance,

09:05.917 --> 09:09.910
some meanness of opinion
and a certain vulgarity of manner.

09:10.125 --> 09:14.498
- These aren't incurable faults.
- I hope she won't tease my Pug.

09:14.708 --> 09:18.536
I've just persuaded Julia
to leave him alone.

09:18.750 --> 09:21.831
But you girls must never be
arrogant towards her.

09:22.042 --> 09:24.116
She is not your equal.

09:24.333 --> 09:27.118
But that must never be apparent to her.

09:27.333 --> 09:31.457
- It is a point of great delicacy.
- Great delicacy, yes.

09:31.917 --> 09:37.784
Dining parlour through there.
Conservatory there. Cellars there.

09:39.083 --> 09:43.326
I hope you don't tend toward sulkiness.
Your mother had the inclination.

09:43.542 --> 09:46.742
Clearly marrying to disoblige her family.

09:47.708 --> 09:49.450
That's the west wing.

09:49.667 --> 09:54.205
Soon to be repaired if Tom could
set aside his horses and dice!

09:55.417 --> 09:57.538
The billiard room.
For the men, of course.

09:57.750 --> 10:00.783
Remember there is moderation
in all things.

10:02.458 --> 10:04.863
Yes... Tom did it of himself.

10:05.083 --> 10:08.449
Very modern...
Very modern...

10:09.083 --> 10:13.290
Sir Thomas' extraordinary library.
Come along, we haven't got all day.

10:13.500 --> 10:16.249
And here is Sir Thomas' study.

10:16.458 --> 10:18.200
Never disturb him here.

10:18.417 --> 10:21.249
He's weighed down with some great cares.

10:21.458 --> 10:23.828
This is his personal sanctuary.

10:24.042 --> 10:27.324
The maids' rooms.
Manservants' rooms down there.

10:27.542 --> 10:29.828
You will be my assistant, you understand.

10:30.042 --> 10:33.786
And here, what was formerly
the nursery and the governor's room,

10:34.000 --> 10:38.041
is now your very own room!

10:47.667 --> 10:49.823
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

10:50.042 --> 10:52.163
How long am I expected to remain here?

10:52.375 --> 10:54.247
That depends, doesn't it?

10:54.458 --> 10:57.373
But if all goes well... for ever.

11:18.833 --> 11:23.988
"Dear Susy, it seems
that Mother has given me away."

11:24.208 --> 11:29.742
"And I can augur nothing but misery
from all I've seen at Mansfield Park."

11:42.833 --> 11:46.530
Don't worry. I'm all for crying.
It makes your hair grow.

11:46.750 --> 11:49.582
Don't make fun of me.

11:56.583 --> 11:58.124
Is it working?

11:58.333 --> 12:00.904
- Is what working?
- My behaviour.

12:01.125 --> 12:04.870
- Is it making you feel better?
- It's certainly distracting.

12:05.083 --> 12:07.832
Good...
Anyway, I'm Edmund.

12:08.375 --> 12:11.575
So, who do you miss?

12:11.792 --> 12:14.327
"I told Edmund
about you especially, Susy."

12:14.542 --> 12:18.157
"He asked me if I wished to write to you.
I said I had no paper."

12:18.375 --> 12:24.372
"And didn't he give me enough for more
stories than you should ever want!"

12:37.958 --> 12:42.117
"By the way,
Eliza eloped to Paris with her lover."

12:42.333 --> 12:45.331
"Unfortunately,
she lived beyond her means"

12:45.542 --> 12:50.080
"and was imprisoned and partially
eaten by her two young sons."

12:50.292 --> 12:52.862
"But she intends
to murder the guards."

12:53.083 --> 12:56.993
"I'll keep you abreast
of any further developments."

12:58.833 --> 13:00.160
"PS..."

13:00.375 --> 13:05.993
"Could you please assure Mother
that I am improving myself daily?"

13:07.083 --> 13:11.243
The history of England.

13:12.542 --> 13:13.951
Henry VI.

13:14.167 --> 13:16.453
It was in this reign
that Joan of Arc lived

13:16.667 --> 13:19.416
and made such a fuss among the English.

13:19.625 --> 13:23.121
They should not have burnt her,
but they did.

13:24.292 --> 13:26.532
Henry VIII...

13:26.750 --> 13:29.997
I'll save you the task of hearing
what you've already heard,

13:30.208 --> 13:34.617
and myself of recounting
what I do not perfectly recollect,

13:34.833 --> 13:36.374
justice and duty...

13:36.583 --> 13:40.411
That disgrace to humanity,
that pest of society, Elizabeth,

13:40.625 --> 13:43.078
who, murderess and wicked queen
that she was,

13:43.292 --> 13:47.617
confined her cousin, the lovely
Mary, Queen of Scots, for 19 years,

13:47.833 --> 13:52.574
and then brought her to an untimely,
unmerited and scandalous death.

13:52.792 --> 13:57.698
Much to the eternal shame of the
monarchy and the entire kingdom.

14:07.792 --> 14:12.034
"By a partial, prejudiced
and ignorant historian."

14:12.250 --> 14:15.283
- Fanny, you're awful!
- All those wars!

14:15.500 --> 14:18.664
The men all good for nothing,
and hardly any women at all.

14:18.875 --> 14:20.498
Very tiresome.

14:20.708 --> 14:25.282
It's odd that history should be so dull.
A great deal of it must be invention.

14:25.500 --> 14:30.869
I shall have to bend your supple mind
in more strict a fashion.

14:31.083 --> 14:34.615
I think the situation calls for some...

14:34.833 --> 14:36.907
...Shakespeare!

14:49.667 --> 14:53.577
Fanny Price!
Please try to act with some decorum!

15:42.083 --> 15:44.157
What?

15:45.833 --> 15:47.907
What?

15:48.125 --> 15:50.116
So you like her?

15:50.333 --> 15:54.741
Mrs. Shakespeare, she's my refuge.
I can't thank you enough.

15:54.958 --> 15:56.866
My gifts are nothing next to yours.

15:57.083 --> 16:00.283
My writing is wood
compared to your wild constructions.

16:00.500 --> 16:04.707
Yes, I'm a wild beast!
I'm sure Sir Thomas would agree.

16:05.375 --> 16:09.416
Don't concern yourself with his gravity.
He has much to preoccupy him.

16:09.625 --> 16:11.911
Such as?

16:13.917 --> 16:15.575
Edmund!

16:15.792 --> 16:18.280
- It's complex.
- And I'm too simple?

16:18.500 --> 16:19.827
Fanny!

16:20.042 --> 16:23.075
He regrets taking me in, doesn't he?

16:23.292 --> 16:25.164
No, it's...

16:26.292 --> 16:30.120
It's just it's problems with the slaves
on the plantation.

16:30.333 --> 16:34.457
- The abolitionists are making inroads.
- That's a good thing, isn't it?

16:36.667 --> 16:40.115
Well, we all live off the profits, Fanny.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.371
Including you.

16:51.083 --> 16:52.908
Tom, you mustn't be serious!

16:53.583 --> 16:55.621
Come back!

16:56.375 --> 16:58.282
Tom!

16:59.000 --> 17:01.749
You will do as I say!

17:01.958 --> 17:04.079
What, and do as you do?

17:04.291 --> 17:08.155
Even I have principles, sir!

17:09.041 --> 17:10.914
Tom!

17:11.708 --> 17:13.532
You are an angel.

17:13.750 --> 17:15.290
Tom!

17:29.708 --> 17:32.659
"Dear Susy,
news items..."

17:32.875 --> 17:36.122
"Sir Thomas has dragged Tom
to the West Indies to..."

17:36.333 --> 17:39.331
"...protect our interests there."

17:39.542 --> 17:43.121
"Maria has found herself a fiancé,
a Mr. Rushworth,"

17:43.333 --> 17:46.331
"who Sir Thomas
has approved by post."

17:46.542 --> 17:49.824
"Everyone seems delighted with him,
except Edmund, who says,"

17:50.042 --> 17:54.664
"'If he had not L12,000 a year,
we'd think him prodigiously dim."'

17:54.875 --> 17:59.331
"Consequently, there's an urgency
for Julia to search for a suitor."

17:59.833 --> 18:02.535
"And Mrs. Norris' husband died..."

18:02.750 --> 18:06.957
"...which did not seem
to inconvenience her at all."

18:07.167 --> 18:11.990
"She's moved into Mansfield proper,
where life is decidedly less expensive."

18:12.208 --> 18:15.574
"What joy is mine!
So..."

18:15.792 --> 18:21.326
"Now there is a new parson
moved into the parsonage, and..."

18:21.542 --> 18:27.491
"...life seems nothing more than
a quick succession of busy nothings."

18:27.958 --> 18:31.205
They are half-brother and -sister
to the parson's wife.

18:31.417 --> 18:35.078
Entertain them with suitable
attention and animation.

18:35.292 --> 18:37.910
Not to mention alacrity!

18:38.125 --> 18:42.866
I might need the rest of the morning
to recover from the ball last night.

18:43.083 --> 18:47.575
- I'm just a mite sluggish.
- Indeed!

18:47.792 --> 18:50.541
Mr. Russel, if you please!

19:11.042 --> 19:15.249
May I introduce Miss Mary Crawford?

19:19.708 --> 19:24.282
And her brother, Mr. Henry Crawford.

19:26.375 --> 19:29.290
This is my sister, Lady Bertram.

19:29.500 --> 19:32.415
Mr. Edmund Bertram.

19:37.333 --> 19:41.409
This is Miss Julia Bertram,
who's just come out into society,

19:41.625 --> 19:47.243
as Miss Maria Bertram, here, has just
become engaged to Mr. Rushworth.

19:52.292 --> 19:55.953
Perhaps you passed Mr. Rushworth's
magnificent estate on your way.

19:56.167 --> 19:58.951
The one with the spectacular gardens,
Sotherton?

19:59.167 --> 20:02.248
Actually, we're planning
some improvements.

20:07.333 --> 20:10.035
And Fanny Price.

20:31.083 --> 20:35.159
Well... you certainly seem a dreary lot!

20:39.292 --> 20:42.823
Please, do join us in our game,
Mr. Crawford.

21:07.875 --> 21:11.916
- Well...?
- I like them both exceedingly.

21:12.125 --> 21:13.997
But I like Julia best.

21:14.208 --> 21:15.666
Why?

21:15.875 --> 21:19.323
Because her Aunt Norris advised me
that it must be so!

21:19.542 --> 21:22.872
She seems very ready
to be fallen in love with.

21:23.083 --> 21:25.619
Though Maria is most agreeable.

21:25.833 --> 21:29.080
- Though her choice is made.
- Yes...

21:29.750 --> 21:32.701
And I like her the better for it.

21:32.917 --> 21:36.531
An engaged woman is always more
agreeable than a disengaged.

21:36.750 --> 21:38.906
She is satisfied with herself.

21:39.125 --> 21:42.704
Her cares are over, and she may exert
all her powers of pleasing

21:42.917 --> 21:44.824
without suspicion.

21:45.042 --> 21:48.952
All is safe with a lady engaged.
No harm can be done.

21:49.167 --> 21:52.449
You allow yourself great latitude
on such points, Henry.

21:52.667 --> 21:56.032
But you will be the one taken in at last.

21:58.750 --> 22:01.239
"'I cannot know if he loves me,'
said Eliza."

22:01.458 --> 22:04.705
"I asked, 'Did he never gaze
on you with admiration?"'

22:04.917 --> 22:11.163
"'Tenderly press your hand?
Drop a tear and leave abruptly?"'

22:11.375 --> 22:13.117
"'Never,' replied she."

22:13.333 --> 22:18.121
"'He's always left the room
when his visit has been ended."'

22:19.542 --> 22:21.663
Edmund...
What do you think?

22:22.833 --> 22:25.203
She's delightful.

22:27.875 --> 22:29.913
They're both delightful.

22:35.542 --> 22:39.370
There could be no harm
in my liking an agreeable man.

22:39.583 --> 22:42.617
- Everyone knows my situation.
- Must you always win?

22:42.833 --> 22:44.954
Even when you already have your prize?

22:45.167 --> 22:47.074
There will be disappointments.

22:47.292 --> 22:50.657
If one scheme of happiness fails...

22:50.875 --> 22:53.908
...human nature turns to another.

22:57.708 --> 23:01.916
You may need your pretty philosophy
in the end, Maria.

23:05.208 --> 23:08.242
Pity Tom, the eldest, is not here.

23:08.458 --> 23:11.207
Or his L20,000 and his baronetcy!

23:11.417 --> 23:15.458
Henry!
You know those things mean nothing to me.

23:15.667 --> 23:17.741
Shall we stay on a while?

23:17.958 --> 23:20.032
Yes, please.

24:49.333 --> 24:55.531
I must say, the pleasures of life rarely
transcend such a moment as this.

24:55.750 --> 24:57.824
Don't you agree, Pugsie?

24:58.042 --> 25:00.826
God damn you!

25:01.042 --> 25:04.657
Tom, are you well?
Is there war? Where's Sir Thomas?

25:04.875 --> 25:07.115
Edmund, come quickly!

25:08.833 --> 25:12.080
Tom, what of Antigua?
Where's Father?

25:12.292 --> 25:16.582
Antigua... All the lovely people there
paying for this party.

25:16.792 --> 25:19.327
Tom, we thought you were in Antigua.

25:20.583 --> 25:21.992
Please!

25:22.208 --> 25:26.665
Tom returned from Antigua
somewhat sooner than expected.

25:26.875 --> 25:32.030
He spent a while in London.
I found him in the Covent Garden Theatre.

25:32.250 --> 25:35.165
- A theatre?
- Yes. They're restaging this...

25:35.375 --> 25:38.657
...delicious slice of naughtiness
called "Lovers' Vows".

25:38.875 --> 25:40.617
I've heard of that.

25:40.833 --> 25:43.784
Tom was a charming parasite until...

25:44.583 --> 25:46.869
Well... he ran out of cash.

25:47.083 --> 25:52.239
Since I sympathise with the tragedy
of unwarranted poverty,

25:52.458 --> 25:57.530
I chose to deliver him to his family,
whom I now find to be so very...

25:58.250 --> 26:00.241
...loving and beautiful.

26:00.458 --> 26:01.832
And solvent.

26:02.458 --> 26:04.698
Solvent?

26:09.458 --> 26:11.532
Mr. Bertram?

26:15.500 --> 26:19.280
The baron meets the bastard son,
takes back his lover,

26:19.500 --> 26:24.785
and they all live happily, I presume,
for some time ever after.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.784
- Bravo, Tom!
- Well told, Tom!

26:28.792 --> 26:31.078
More dim-witted fiction
to clutter the world.

26:31.292 --> 26:33.164
Come now, Mr. Bertram.

26:33.375 --> 26:36.990
Drama is to life
what ships are to the sea.

26:37.208 --> 26:41.415
A means to traverse it.
To plumb its depths, breadth and beauty.

26:41.625 --> 26:43.497
I couldn't agree more.

26:43.708 --> 26:47.370
Good drama, in which the greatest
powers of the mind are displayed,

26:47.583 --> 26:52.536
in which the most thorough knowledge
of human nature, the liveliest wit,

26:52.750 --> 26:56.578
are conveyed to the world
through the best chosen language.

26:56.792 --> 26:58.534
This is essential.

26:58.750 --> 27:01.203
This is trash!

27:02.583 --> 27:04.621
He's so serious!

27:04.833 --> 27:07.701
That is the worst charge, isn't it?

27:09.708 --> 27:12.457
What do you think, Miss Price?

27:12.667 --> 27:16.874
I'm sorry to disappoint,
but I do not have a ready opinion.

27:17.083 --> 27:21.291
I suspect you are entirely composed
of ready opinions not shared.

27:21.500 --> 27:23.076
Fanny.

27:23.292 --> 27:27.202
- Yes, Aunt Norris?
- What are you doing here?

27:27.417 --> 27:32.951
- I beg your pardon.
- The sewing wasn't cleared away.

27:33.583 --> 27:36.747
You're quite right, it wasn't.
I'll...

27:38.083 --> 27:40.951
I'll see to it immediately.

27:43.875 --> 27:47.703
Aunt Norris, surely the sewing can wait?

27:58.875 --> 28:03.911
Pray, is she out or is she not...
into society?

28:04.125 --> 28:08.581
- I can't see that it matters terribly.
- Forget this nonsense.

28:08.792 --> 28:10.866
Let's stage the play.

28:11.083 --> 28:13.951
Here. Now.
Together.

28:14.167 --> 28:17.082
Yatesy, you're a genius.

28:17.292 --> 28:21.499
Why, this is the very room for a theatre.

28:21.708 --> 28:27.159
And Father's study will
provide for an excellent stage!

28:28.292 --> 28:33.577
It has been mentioned that I have
quite a gift for the stage... actually.

28:35.167 --> 28:37.122
Tom, you're not serious?

28:37.333 --> 28:39.952
Not serious?
Me?

28:40.167 --> 28:44.492
"Lover's Vows"? I'm convinced
that our father would disapprove.

28:44.708 --> 28:47.541
I think I know our father
as well as you do.

28:47.750 --> 28:51.660
Manage yourself and let me
take care of the rest of the family.

28:51.875 --> 28:55.454
Don't act yourself if you
do not like it, but please...

28:55.667 --> 28:58.120
...don't try to govern everybody else.

28:58.333 --> 29:00.490
All settled, then?

29:00.708 --> 29:03.576
- Good!
- What?

29:03.792 --> 29:08.366
What's the matter?
I was not asleep.

29:08.583 --> 29:12.115
No, of course not, ma'am.
No one suspected you.

29:12.333 --> 29:14.490
Where's Fanny?

29:14.708 --> 29:17.741
Mrs. Norris, get me Fanny Price.

29:19.292 --> 29:21.117
I wish to play Amelia.

29:21.333 --> 29:27.081
But which gentleman am I to have
the pleasure of making love to?

29:29.333 --> 29:33.327
Why has the wish to do what is right
become an unattractive quality?

29:33.542 --> 29:37.203
And now Tom wants
Charles Maddox to play Anhalt.

29:37.417 --> 29:41.078
He's about as discreet as the town crier!

29:42.583 --> 29:48.331
So this is where you hide.
I need some rehearsing. Would you mind...?

29:50.167 --> 29:52.074
Mr. Bertram!
Hello.

29:52.792 --> 29:54.332
Hello, Miss Crawford.

29:54.542 --> 29:58.405
- I'll be off, then, Fanny.
- Stay, stay!

29:58.625 --> 30:01.789
Stay!
We need an audience.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.033
We all need an audience, don't we, Fanny?

30:05.250 --> 30:07.406
I live in dread of audiences.

30:07.625 --> 30:09.663
Come.
I will play Amelia.

30:09.875 --> 30:12.659
- And you will play Anhalt my teacher.
- No, no.

30:12.875 --> 30:17.331
Read from there, since Mr. Bertram refuses.
I insist.

30:18.125 --> 30:20.448
Very well.

30:21.875 --> 30:25.703
"For a long time,
you have instructed me."

30:27.042 --> 30:31.746
- "Why should not I now teach you?"
- "Teach me what?"

30:31.958 --> 30:35.406
"Whatever I know and you don't."

30:37.000 --> 30:40.033
"There are some things
I'd rather never know."

30:40.250 --> 30:44.789
"As you made certain mathematical
problems pleasant to me,"

30:45.000 --> 30:49.076
"I might teach
something as pleasant to you."

30:49.292 --> 30:51.827
"Woman herself is a problem."

30:52.042 --> 30:55.242
"And I'll teach you to make her out."

30:55.458 --> 30:57.330
"You teach?"

30:57.542 --> 30:59.082
"Why not?"

30:59.292 --> 31:03.866
"None but a woman can teach
the science of herself."

31:06.417 --> 31:10.541
Upon reconsideration,
I cannot help but think that...

31:10.750 --> 31:13.417
...despite the displeasure
of appearing inconsistent,

31:13.625 --> 31:15.948
it would be better for me to play Anhalt

31:16.167 --> 31:19.034
than invite Charles Maddox
into this mixture.

31:19.250 --> 31:21.406
Excellent!

31:26.000 --> 31:29.828
"There are some things
I would rather never know."

31:34.042 --> 31:37.657
"What is this?
How is this?"

31:39.125 --> 31:43.664
"And why do I find my mother thus?
Speak."

31:43.875 --> 31:46.624
"I cannot speak, my dear son."

31:46.833 --> 31:50.116
"My dear Frederick,
I was not prepared."

31:50.958 --> 31:54.241
"Dear Mother, compose yourself.
Now then..."

31:58.833 --> 32:00.990
Put it down over there.

32:09.292 --> 32:12.041
Hello, my sweet dear girl.

32:12.875 --> 32:14.700
Welcome home, sir.

32:20.625 --> 32:23.955
My word!
You've grown in health.

32:24.167 --> 32:26.490
And, I dare say, beauty.

32:27.875 --> 32:31.039
Where are the rest, Julia and Maria?
What's that?

32:31.250 --> 32:34.034
- Well, it's...
- Improvements?

32:35.667 --> 32:37.457
Baddeley.

32:47.458 --> 32:51.617
You must be Sir Thomas!
I am Rushworth.

32:52.458 --> 32:55.125
Your future son-in-law.

32:55.833 --> 32:59.246
We are in the midst of a home theatrical.
I'm Count Cassel.

32:59.458 --> 33:02.540
I come in with a blue dress
and a pink satin cloak...

33:02.750 --> 33:07.987
...afterwards I have another fine suit
by way of a shooting dress.

33:08.208 --> 33:11.704
I have two and forty speeches which is...

33:11.917 --> 33:13.954
...no trifle.

33:19.625 --> 33:21.580
Father!

33:26.500 --> 33:29.451
- Absolutely not!
- It won't be much.

33:29.667 --> 33:31.539
Father...

33:33.042 --> 33:40.449
Tom... So this is what you were
in such a hurry to leave Antigua for?

33:49.250 --> 33:51.620
Sir Thomas...

33:51.833 --> 33:56.905
I could not have borne
your absence a moment longer.

34:08.417 --> 34:09.744
Come on!

34:18.500 --> 34:23.322
"Dear Susy, all remnants
of the theatre have been erased,"

34:23.542 --> 34:28.827
"and Tom and Yates have fled
the new solemnity that has returned."

34:29.042 --> 34:31.495
Do tell us more about the Negroes, dear.

34:31.708 --> 34:36.449
The mulattos are well-shaped, and
the women especially well-featured.

34:36.667 --> 34:42.782
I have one, so easy and graceful in
her movements and intelligent as well.

34:43.000 --> 34:46.117
Strangely, two mulattos
can never have children.

34:46.333 --> 34:48.952
They're like mules in that respect.

34:51.500 --> 34:56.074
Excuse me, Father, for contradicting
you, but that is nonsense.

34:56.292 --> 35:00.914
- You cannot say such things.
- I did not say they are mules.

35:01.125 --> 35:03.080
I said they are like mules.

35:03.292 --> 35:07.072
Long's 'History of Jamaica'.
Read it before you challenge me.

35:07.292 --> 35:11.499
I've a good mind to bring one back
with me to work here as a domestic.

35:11.708 --> 35:16.615
Correct if I am in error, but if you were
to bring a slave back to England,

35:16.833 --> 35:22.202
there would be some argument
whether or not they should be freed.

35:24.417 --> 35:27.284
If I'm not mistaken...

35:28.125 --> 35:30.660
I must say, you've changed considerably.

35:30.875 --> 35:36.493
I've done some reading on it...
Thomas Clarkson, under Edmund's guidance.

35:36.708 --> 35:40.039
Fanny has a voracious mind,
as hungry as any man's.

35:40.250 --> 35:43.995
And her writing is remarkable,
in a style entirely new.

35:44.208 --> 35:47.159
Yes, good...
Yes...

35:47.375 --> 35:51.155
Your complexion is so improved.

35:51.375 --> 35:55.072
I trust you will see as much
beauty of mind in time, Father.

35:55.292 --> 36:00.245
You've gained so much countenance,
and your figure...

36:00.458 --> 36:02.283
Please...

36:03.500 --> 36:05.786
Don't you agree, Mr... Crawford?

36:06.000 --> 36:09.864
- Purity is a decided attraction, true.
- Indeed.

36:10.083 --> 36:11.624
Especially for the impure.

36:11.833 --> 36:17.332
It must be the moral steadfastness
of her heart that illuminates her eyes.

36:17.917 --> 36:19.954
- Please!
- Gentlemen...

36:20.167 --> 36:24.871
Fanny is as fearful of notice and praise
as other women are of neglect.

36:25.083 --> 36:28.863
- Most discerning, Miss Crawford.
- Thank you, Mr. Bertram.

36:29.083 --> 36:33.159
I have it! A ball at Mansfield Park
in honour of Fanny!

36:33.375 --> 36:36.492
We shall introduce
Miss Fanny Price to society.

36:37.208 --> 36:40.621
Some young man of good standing
will take notice.

36:40.833 --> 36:45.455
She'll glide about with quiet elegance
and in admirable time.

36:45.667 --> 36:47.906
You must excuse me.

36:48.958 --> 36:51.494
I think I have something...

36:51.958 --> 36:54.992
It needn't be a large affair,
just a few friends...

36:59.708 --> 37:02.541
Fanny, don't be foolish, it is raining.

37:02.750 --> 37:05.618
I see more distinctly through the rain.

37:05.833 --> 37:10.076
- It's just a silly ball.
- I'll not be sold off like a slave!

37:10.292 --> 37:12.164
Don't be an imbecile!

37:12.375 --> 37:16.285
But imbecility in women is a great
enhancement to personal charms!

37:17.250 --> 37:19.122
Fanny...

37:19.333 --> 37:21.573
You're being irrational!

37:21.792 --> 37:24.161
Another adornment.
I must be ravishing.

37:24.375 --> 37:29.079
Fanny, you really must begin
to harden yourself to the idea of...

37:29.292 --> 37:32.159
...being worth looking at.

38:21.375 --> 38:24.906
- You could do worse, Edmund.
- Sir?

38:25.125 --> 38:28.491
She is witty and bright,
and not without... worth.

38:29.000 --> 38:33.704
- How might you measure that worth?
- Don't impress me with your purity.

38:33.917 --> 38:36.619
Her family is well-established,
it is well known.

38:36.833 --> 38:39.452
The Prices?

38:40.167 --> 38:42.951
The Crawfords, Edmund.

38:43.167 --> 38:47.705
I meant the Crawfords...
Mary Crawford.

39:34.292 --> 39:36.366
What are you reading?

39:36.583 --> 39:40.624
Laurence Sterne's 'A Sentimental Journey'.

39:43.167 --> 39:45.039
May I?

39:58.500 --> 40:03.039
"I was interrupted with a voice
which I took to be that of a child,"

40:03.250 --> 40:06.367
"which complained
it could not get out."

40:06.583 --> 40:11.655
"I looked up and down the passage
and saw a starling in a little cage."

40:11.875 --> 40:15.821
"'I can't get out, I can't get out!'
said the starling."

40:16.042 --> 40:20.249
"'God help thee,' said I.
'But I'll let thee out, cost what it will."'

40:20.458 --> 40:24.831
"But it was double-twisted with wire,
and I had to pull the cage to pieces."

40:25.042 --> 40:27.530
"I took both hands to it."

40:27.750 --> 40:30.452
"The bird flew to where I was
attempting his deliverance,"

40:30.667 --> 40:35.205
"and thrusting his head
through the trellis as if impatient,"

40:35.958 --> 40:39.289
"'I fear, poor creature,' said I,"

40:40.042 --> 40:42.909
"'I cannot set thee at liberty."'

40:43.125 --> 40:45.957
"'No,' said the starling."

40:46.167 --> 40:50.540
"'I can't get out. I can't get out,'
said the starling."

40:59.875 --> 41:02.328
You read well.

41:03.083 --> 41:04.706
Thank you.

41:22.208 --> 41:26.072
Father, I wish to speak
to you about Rushworth.

41:28.667 --> 41:31.036
Maria, yes...

41:32.083 --> 41:37.119
Now, you know how eagerly disposed
I was to like your Mr. Rushworth.

41:37.333 --> 41:40.995
But you think him an inferior young man.

41:41.208 --> 41:44.372
As ignorant in business as in books
with opinions unfixed

41:44.583 --> 41:47.581
and without seeming
much aware of it himself.

41:48.333 --> 41:50.324
I'm not blind, Father.

41:50.542 --> 41:57.072
Perhaps the alliance, advantageous
as it is, was too quickly agreed to.

41:57.292 --> 42:00.622
You need not worry, Maria,
I shall take care of you.

42:00.833 --> 42:05.242
Every inconvenience should be braved
and the connection given up,

42:05.458 --> 42:09.701
if you feel yourself unhappy
in the prospect of it.

42:11.000 --> 42:14.697
I will not pretend
he is of shining character.

42:17.458 --> 42:21.582
But I will also not pretend
that enjoying a larger income,

42:21.792 --> 42:26.864
a house in the city and all the other
amiable pleasures it will afford,

42:27.083 --> 42:29.619
are not an attraction.

42:29.833 --> 42:31.741
As for the rest...

42:33.125 --> 42:35.744
Well, he's still young.

42:35.958 --> 42:37.416
And...

42:39.083 --> 42:41.406
...I would like to marry him immediately.

42:41.625 --> 42:43.948
Within a fortnight.

42:44.167 --> 42:48.030
- I do not understand the urgency.
- I don't understand the delay.

42:48.250 --> 42:51.829
I would like for Julia to accompany me
on the honeymoon.

42:52.042 --> 42:56.285
You wish for Julia to accompany you
on your honeymoon?

42:56.500 --> 42:59.368
She's never been to Brighton.

43:09.208 --> 43:12.491
- Evening.
- Evening to you, sir.

43:16.500 --> 43:19.830
"Dear Susy,
Maria was married on Saturday."

43:20.042 --> 43:23.324
"In all important preparations of mind,
she was complete."

43:23.542 --> 43:25.828
"Prepared for matrimony
by a hatred of home,"

43:26.042 --> 43:31.493
"disappointed affection and contempt
of the man she was to marry."

43:33.583 --> 43:38.620
"The bride was elegantly dressed and
the bridesmaids were duly inferior."

43:38.833 --> 43:45.197
"Her mother had her salts, expecting
to be agitated, and her aunt tried to cry."

43:45.417 --> 43:48.829
"Marriage is indeed
a manoeuvring business."

43:50.708 --> 43:53.114
Goodbye, my precious!

43:53.333 --> 43:55.454
Good luck!

43:55.667 --> 43:57.243
Bye!

43:57.458 --> 44:01.997
It is a comfort to think
you will never leave us, Fanny.

44:24.208 --> 44:27.325
- My dear Fanny!
- No, no...

44:30.500 --> 44:36.248
- I should take the apples to Mrs. Norris.
- I want you to stay and play with me.

44:36.458 --> 44:38.248
She must forgive me.

44:38.458 --> 44:43.329
Selfishness must always be forgiven,
because there's no hope of a cure!

44:49.250 --> 44:51.785
So lovely.

44:52.000 --> 44:57.155
Tomorrow evening, the ballroom
shall be lit solely by your beauty.

44:57.375 --> 45:00.539
You do have a fine form, my dear.

45:00.750 --> 45:03.950
No wonder Edmund
so delights in your company.

45:04.167 --> 45:07.414
I'm so evil he knows not
what to make of me.

45:07.625 --> 45:10.789
Would that I had your sound judgment.

45:11.667 --> 45:13.657
Tell me...

45:13.875 --> 45:17.536
- Does he speak of me?
- Occasionally.

45:17.750 --> 45:21.032
Is that your harp in the front room?

45:21.250 --> 45:25.196
Indeed. It was transported
from London on Henry's carriage.

45:25.417 --> 45:27.372
I tried to hire a horse and cart,

45:27.583 --> 45:31.826
but found I'd asked the most
unreasonable thing in the world!

45:32.042 --> 45:36.746
I'd offended all the farmers,
the labourers and the hay in the parish.

45:36.958 --> 45:39.198
Getting the hay in is of great importance

45:39.417 --> 45:42.498
in the country... at this time.

45:43.625 --> 45:45.995
And music isn't?

45:46.208 --> 45:48.957
It depends on the music, I suppose.

46:17.708 --> 46:22.365
That's Edmund's favourite.
He seems very alive to music.

46:22.583 --> 46:24.242
Yes...

46:24.458 --> 46:28.748
Edmund says that in church it is music
that best allows the spirit...

46:28.958 --> 46:31.198
...to aspire to the beyond.

46:31.417 --> 46:32.826
Heavens!

46:33.042 --> 46:37.699
Why waste it on drowsy church-goers
starched up into seeming piety?

46:37.917 --> 46:41.496
Give me a concert or a dance.
I'm sure he'd agree.

46:41.708 --> 46:45.405
Forgive me my contradiction,
but I'm sure he wouldn't.

46:45.625 --> 46:51.574
When he takes orders in a few weeks,
he will begin his own services.

46:51.792 --> 46:54.197
Takes orders?

46:54.917 --> 46:57.666
Is Edmund to be a clergyman?

46:57.875 --> 46:59.700
Yes.

47:00.542 --> 47:04.831
But a clergyman is so drear.
A clergyman's wife is even worse!

47:07.167 --> 47:10.615
What profession would you suggest,
Miss Crawford?

47:10.833 --> 47:13.322
I'm not, as you know, the first born.

47:13.542 --> 47:17.037
There must be an uncle or grandfather
to place you somewhere?

47:17.250 --> 47:18.956
There is not.

47:19.167 --> 47:21.204
Choose law, then, it's not too late.

47:21.417 --> 47:24.865
At least you can distinguish yourself
there with language and wit.

47:25.083 --> 47:29.575
I have no wish to blunder about
on the borders of empty repartee.

47:29.792 --> 47:31.913
Your father could put you into Parliament.

47:32.125 --> 47:36.368
My father's choices
are less than compelling for me.

47:36.583 --> 47:39.830
No, I wish to become a clergyman.

47:40.500 --> 47:45.241
There are worse things than a life
of compassion and contemplation.

47:50.417 --> 47:53.368
She doesn't think evil, but she speaks it.

47:53.583 --> 47:55.787
It grieves me to the soul.

47:56.000 --> 47:59.081
The effect of education perhaps.

48:00.125 --> 48:03.621
Perhaps I can uneducate her.

48:03.833 --> 48:07.246
Fanny, would that more women
were like you.

48:07.458 --> 48:13.039
I love you more than words can say.
I demand the first dance at the ball.

48:38.125 --> 48:42.948
One's consequence varies so much
at times without any particular reason.

48:43.167 --> 48:49.281
There's a reason for everything.
Your entire person is agreeable.

48:50.292 --> 48:53.823
Yes.
Well, tonight I agree with everyone.

48:58.750 --> 49:00.575
Edmund...

49:02.083 --> 49:06.954
I think you should admit
you're in love with Fanny Price.

49:07.167 --> 49:09.371
Of course I love her, but...

49:09.583 --> 49:14.739
...there are as many forms of love
as there are moments in time.

49:23.208 --> 49:27.118
Perfect!
You dance like an angel, Fanny Price.

49:27.333 --> 49:30.864
One does not dance like an angel alone,
Mr. Crawford.

49:31.083 --> 49:35.124
A compliment?!
Let the heavens rejoice!

49:35.333 --> 49:39.576
I complimented your dancing.
Keep your wig on!

50:51.625 --> 50:54.160
- Thank you.
- See you soon.

50:55.125 --> 50:57.199
- Bye!
- Bye-bye.

51:06.000 --> 51:09.448
"A few hours before Laura died, she said,"

51:09.667 --> 51:12.997
"'Take warning from my unhappy end."'

51:13.208 --> 51:17.332
"'Beware of fainting fits.
Beware of swoons."'

51:39.542 --> 51:42.409
"'Run mad as often as you choose..."'

51:44.667 --> 51:47.783
"'...but do not faint."'

51:52.292 --> 51:55.206
- Good afternoon.
- Hello, Sir Thomas.

51:55.417 --> 51:57.952
- Good afternoon, sir.
- My dear.

51:59.208 --> 52:02.076
I've been thinking about the parsonage.

52:02.292 --> 52:04.329
Not you, too?

52:04.917 --> 52:07.156
Spades are trumps, Fanny.

52:07.375 --> 52:12.956
- I'm all in the glow of a new scheme.
- And what might that be?

52:13.167 --> 52:16.118
Might you rent the parsonage to me?

52:16.333 --> 52:20.907
- But it is to be Edmund's.
- Anyone to purchase a queen?

52:21.125 --> 52:23.578
- At what cost?
- Two shillings.

52:23.792 --> 52:28.366
- Highway robbery!
- Mr. Bertram could stay living here.

52:28.583 --> 52:30.788
You can stay close to your family,

52:31.000 --> 52:35.290
and I can continue to improve
and perfect my friendship and...

52:35.500 --> 52:39.328
...intimacy
with the Mansfield Park family.

52:39.542 --> 52:42.575
I have a better plan.
Live here with us.

52:42.792 --> 52:45.908
Stay as long as you wish.
Bring all your horses.

52:46.125 --> 52:49.242
Your sister, too.
Be as one of our family.

52:49.458 --> 52:55.039
- We'd thrive on it, wouldn't we, Fanny?
- Of course. A king for three shillings?

52:56.125 --> 52:59.158
- I will.
- Mary! It's exorbitant!

52:59.375 --> 53:04.079
I'll stake my last like a woman of spirit.
No cold prudence for me.

53:04.292 --> 53:06.745
I was not made
to sit still and do nothing!

53:06.958 --> 53:10.952
If I lose the game,
it shall not be for not striving for it.

53:15.792 --> 53:18.541
Well done, Fanny!

53:22.000 --> 53:25.661
Fanny!
I must speak to you...

53:25.875 --> 53:27.912
Yes, Mr. Crawford?

53:31.333 --> 53:34.699
You must know
why I intend to rent the parsonage.

53:34.917 --> 53:39.574
I wish to continue improving
and perfecting my intimacy...

53:39.792 --> 53:41.699
...with you!

53:41.917 --> 53:47.072
You have created sensations which
my heart has never known before.

53:47.292 --> 53:50.373
The one happiness in life
is to love and be loved.

53:50.583 --> 53:52.869
Mr. Crawford, do not speak nonsense!

53:53.792 --> 53:55.829
Nonsense?

53:56.042 --> 53:59.786
I'm afraid you may end
in convincing yourself!

54:00.000 --> 54:04.823
Fanny...
You are killing me!

54:05.042 --> 54:09.035
No man dies of love but on the stage.

54:23.500 --> 54:26.533
"The intimacy between them
daily increased,"

54:26.750 --> 54:31.407
"till it grew to such a pitch that
they did not scruple to kick one another"

54:31.625 --> 54:34.623
"on the slightest provocation."

54:37.375 --> 54:38.998
Yes?

54:41.500 --> 54:45.790
My sweet girl!
This is a great day, a great day indeed.

54:46.000 --> 54:47.872
Yes...
Is it?

54:48.083 --> 54:51.414
You may make me more proud
than my own daughters.

54:51.625 --> 54:54.623
Please don't say that, sir.

54:55.708 --> 54:58.790
Why is there no fire here today?

55:00.083 --> 55:04.077
- I'm not cold, sir.
- But you have a fire in general?

55:04.292 --> 55:07.373
No, sir, but I have a warm shawl.

55:08.875 --> 55:12.288
Your aunt cannot be aware of this.

55:15.375 --> 55:17.828
I understand.

55:18.042 --> 55:22.995
For as long as you're in my home,
Fanny Price, you shall have a fire.

55:24.000 --> 55:28.408
I am aware that there has been
a misplaced distinction, but...

55:28.625 --> 55:33.448
...I think too well of you to suppose
you will ever harbour resentment.

55:33.667 --> 55:36.202
Thus, it is with more pleasure,

55:36.417 --> 55:41.287
that I inform you that Henry Crawford
has asked my permission to marry you,

55:41.500 --> 55:43.656
and I have given my blessing.

55:43.875 --> 55:47.703
I'd no idea his feelings
had come to such a boiling point!

55:47.917 --> 55:53.072
Clearly, I am too old to follow
the intricate manoeuvrings of the young.

55:56.667 --> 55:59.534
Please get ready and join me downstairs.

55:59.750 --> 56:05.083
Mr. Crawford, as you have perhaps foreseen,
is still in the house.

56:11.333 --> 56:13.904
Do not fear.

56:14.125 --> 56:16.411
I cannot, sir.

56:16.625 --> 56:18.331
Cannot what?

56:18.542 --> 56:22.286
I cannot agree to marry him...
at this time.

56:22.500 --> 56:26.825
You do not know your own feelings.
I've watched you with him.

56:27.042 --> 56:30.573
You're not insensitive to his charms.
I'm not that old!

56:30.792 --> 56:32.913
He's not without charm, sir.

56:33.125 --> 56:37.035
Has someone else
declared his intention for you?

56:37.250 --> 56:40.698
- No, sir.
- Then what is it?

56:41.917 --> 56:44.701
I do not trust his nature.

56:44.917 --> 56:49.206
Like many charming people, he
depends on the appreciation of others.

56:49.417 --> 56:51.491
What is the ill in that?

56:51.708 --> 56:55.489
His sole interest is in being loved,
not in loving.

56:55.708 --> 57:01.622
- You've read too many novels, girl!
- But it has not clouded my judgment.

57:02.500 --> 57:06.364
- Do you trust me?
- My future entirely depends on you.

57:06.583 --> 57:09.534
Let me repeat: do you trust me?

57:09.750 --> 57:12.582
- Yes, sir.
- Well, I trust him.

57:12.792 --> 57:15.873
You will marry him!

57:16.083 --> 57:18.750
I will not...

57:20.958 --> 57:22.783
...sir.

57:26.667 --> 57:31.952
I had, Fanny Price, thought you
free from wilfulness of temper,

57:32.167 --> 57:36.658
self-conceit and every tendency
to that independence of spirit,

57:36.875 --> 57:40.821
which prevails so much today
even in young women.

57:41.042 --> 57:46.825
In young women it is especially
offensive beyond all common offence.

57:47.042 --> 57:51.865
You seem to forget you do not have
an annual income like Mary Crawford.

57:52.083 --> 57:54.074
Nor does your family.

57:54.292 --> 57:58.996
Their advantage or disadvantage
has never been in your thoughts.

57:59.208 --> 58:03.118
The young man addresses you
with everything to recommend him.

58:03.333 --> 58:07.576
Not merely situation in life, fortune
and character, but also agreeableness,

58:07.792 --> 58:10.576
with pleasing address and conversation.

58:10.792 --> 58:14.204
...not an acquaintance,
you've known him some time.

58:14.417 --> 58:20.828
His sister is your intimate friend.
He cannot have taken you by surprise.

58:21.042 --> 58:25.533
You have observed his attentions
and received them properly...

58:25.750 --> 58:31.580
You do not know your own feelings.
Let us put an end to this conference.

58:31.792 --> 58:34.362
...and because you do not feel
for him

58:34.583 --> 58:39.655
what a young heated fancy imagines
to be necessary for happiness...

58:39.875 --> 58:41.949
I should say not...

58:44.167 --> 58:49.156
You are in a wild fit of folly, throwing
away an opportunity to be settled in life,

58:49.375 --> 58:55.537
eligibly, honourably, nobly settled,
as will probably never occur again.

58:56.083 --> 59:01.783
And I will tell you what, Fanny Price,
which is more than I did for Maria...

59:02.000 --> 59:05.247
The next time that Pug has a litter...

59:06.333 --> 59:09.201
...you shall have a puppy.

59:15.958 --> 59:19.158
All she needs is time, Sir Thomas.

59:19.375 --> 59:21.330
He loves you, Fanny Price.

59:21.542 --> 59:27.290
If any man ever loved a woman forever,
Henry would do as much for you.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.038
Edmund...

59:31.000 --> 59:33.868
What are your thoughts?

59:35.375 --> 59:39.949
The fact that he chose you, Fanny,
is evidence of his good character.

59:41.625 --> 59:47.492
He could make you very happy,
and you would be the making of him.

59:50.750 --> 59:56.912
It is not certain that a man must be
acceptable to every woman he likes.

59:57.125 --> 01:00:02.743
Perhaps you'd rather return home?
I can write to your mother tonight.

01:00:02.958 --> 01:00:07.166
A little abstinence from the luxuries
of Mansfield Park

01:00:07.375 --> 01:00:10.741
might bring your mind
into a more sober state.

01:00:10.958 --> 01:00:14.040
Is that your choice, young woman?

01:00:15.542 --> 01:00:17.579
Yes.

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:20.123
It is.

01:00:20.708 --> 01:00:22.166
Why, Fanny?

01:00:26.917 --> 01:00:29.784
To be at home again...

01:00:30.667 --> 01:00:33.333
...to be loved by my family,

01:00:33.542 --> 01:00:37.487
to feel affection
without fear or restraint and...

01:00:38.667 --> 01:00:43.123
...to feel myself the equal
of those that surround me.

01:01:03.292 --> 01:01:05.413
I hope you know...

01:01:07.833 --> 01:01:11.779
I hope you know how much I shall...

01:01:13.292 --> 01:01:15.117
...shall write to you.

01:01:17.542 --> 01:01:19.911
And I shall write to you...

01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:26.281
...when I have anything
worth writing about.

01:01:44.875 --> 01:01:48.703
Who says we shall not be sisters?

01:01:48.917 --> 01:01:50.991
I know we shall.

01:02:56.167 --> 01:02:58.039
There!

01:03:22.958 --> 01:03:24.748
Mother!

01:03:24.958 --> 01:03:26.913
Fanny!

01:03:28.208 --> 01:03:30.080
Come in.

01:03:30.833 --> 01:03:33.582
You must be exhausted from your journey.

01:03:33.792 --> 01:03:36.576
It's surprisingly short really.

01:03:36.792 --> 01:03:39.660
Look at you.
So...

01:03:42.917 --> 01:03:46.329
Betsey, get Father up!
Come in.

01:03:46.542 --> 01:03:48.746
It's Susy's turn.

01:03:52.250 --> 01:03:57.121
Did you have a tiring journey?
You must be exhausted. Betsey!

01:03:57.333 --> 01:04:00.248
- I got him up yesterday.
- Liar!

01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:12.040
- You must have many servants.
- I have to do quite a lot, actually.

01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:16.291
- I help Lady Bertram and Aunt Norris.
- I only have the two girls.

01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:20.161
We had some help,
but now Father has no work.

01:04:20.375 --> 01:04:22.081
Hello.

01:04:22.292 --> 01:04:26.914
- How long are you here for, Fanny?
- I cannot say exactly.

01:04:27.125 --> 01:04:29.827
Father won't get up.

01:04:30.417 --> 01:04:32.822
She's here!

01:04:34.917 --> 01:04:36.244
Hello!

01:04:37.167 --> 01:04:40.497
Oh, my God!
Fanny!

01:04:40.708 --> 01:04:43.244
You look so fancy.

01:04:43.458 --> 01:04:48.791
Like a princess! Didn't I tell you
she'd be beautiful, Mother?

01:04:49.292 --> 01:04:51.164
Yes, you did.

01:04:52.292 --> 01:04:55.871
Father, Fanny's come home.
Here she is.

01:04:56.625 --> 01:05:00.073
Turn round, then.
Let's have a look at you.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.872
Turn around!

01:05:06.583 --> 01:05:07.910
Lovely.

01:05:09.792 --> 01:05:13.453
Come here, Chatterbox,
I was just teasing you.

01:05:13.667 --> 01:05:17.874
Give your coarse old father a big squeeze.

01:05:21.417 --> 01:05:23.491
Welcome home, Fanny.

01:05:24.375 --> 01:05:27.326
It'll be good to have another girl around.

01:05:28.042 --> 01:05:34.323
Well, I'm about ready to throw down
some straw and call this place a stall.

01:05:34.542 --> 01:05:36.698
Don't get me started!

01:05:59.917 --> 01:06:03.365
"Beware of fainting fits,
beware of swoons."

01:06:03.583 --> 01:06:07.659
"A frenzy fit is not so pernicious.
It is an exercise to the body."

01:06:07.875 --> 01:06:10.873
"if not too violent,
it is conducive to health."

01:06:11.083 --> 01:06:13.453
Fanny, a letter!

01:06:13.667 --> 01:06:15.243
Who is it from?

01:06:15.458 --> 01:06:18.456
Mary Crawford, a friend.

01:06:20.167 --> 01:06:24.030
"How we miss you,
my dearest Fanny Price."

01:06:24.250 --> 01:06:28.540
"My brother is moping. Please write
a pretty reply to gladden his eyes."

01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:34.119
"Tell me of all the dashing captains
whom you disdain for his sake."

01:06:37.458 --> 01:06:41.997
"I have seen Julia and Mrs. Rushworth
at Wimpole Street the other day."

01:06:42.208 --> 01:06:47.577
"We seemed very glad to see each
other, and I do think we were a little."

01:06:49.458 --> 01:06:51.911
"We had a vast deal to say..."

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.164
"...especially on the subject
of you and Henry."

01:06:56.375 --> 01:07:00.665
"I'll tell you how Mrs. Rushworth looked
when your name was mentioned."

01:07:00.875 --> 01:07:02.996
Fanny...?

01:07:03.208 --> 01:07:05.199
Fanny Price?

01:07:05.417 --> 01:07:08.166
"I didn't think her wanting
in self-possession,"

01:07:08.375 --> 01:07:13.612
"but she had not quite enough
for the demands of yesterday."

01:07:13.833 --> 01:07:17.530
I shall believe it when I believe it, Henry.

01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:20.618
And so you shall, Mrs. Rushworth.

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:24.996
"And as for Edmund, clergyman or not,"

01:07:25.208 --> 01:07:30.328
"let me say, I am increasingly
sensitive to his charms."

01:07:30.542 --> 01:07:33.623
"Yours affectionately,
Mary Crawford."

01:07:33.833 --> 01:07:35.907
Betsey!

01:07:43.542 --> 01:07:46.112
This Henry Crawford, what's he like?

01:07:46.333 --> 01:07:48.573
A rake, I think.

01:07:48.792 --> 01:07:51.908
Yes, please!

01:07:52.125 --> 01:07:55.123
They amuse more in literature
than in life.

01:07:55.333 --> 01:07:57.786
But they amuse!

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.576
And Lady Bertram?

01:07:59.792 --> 01:08:02.659
- She's always suffering fatigue.
- Why?

01:08:02.875 --> 01:08:06.406
Generally from embroidering
something of little beauty.

01:08:06.625 --> 01:08:09.872
Not to mention
a handsome dose of opium daily.

01:08:10.083 --> 01:08:14.207
Your tongue is sharper
than a guillotine, Fanny.

01:08:15.208 --> 01:08:18.290
The effect of education, I suppose.

01:08:26.792 --> 01:08:29.956
Miss Price!
Miss Fanny Price!

01:08:30.167 --> 01:08:33.532
- Miss Price?
- What is that racket?

01:08:33.750 --> 01:08:37.743
- Miss Price!
- What is it, boy?

01:08:37.957 --> 01:08:40.872
I must see Fanny Price!

01:08:45.832 --> 01:08:47.160
Miss Price?

01:08:47.792 --> 01:08:52.330
- Miss Fanny Price...
- I'm Fanny Price.

01:08:52.542 --> 01:08:56.950
- You sure? I don't get paid if you're not.
- Yes, I'm sure I'm Fanny Price.

01:08:57.167 --> 01:09:00.247
All right, then, stay back.

01:09:45.417 --> 01:09:53.073
I was supposed to say something
about starlings flying... I can't remember.

01:09:53.292 --> 01:09:56.492
Yes, we've got the general idea.
Thank you.

01:09:56.708 --> 01:09:59.375
Fanny, what is this?

01:10:14.792 --> 01:10:16.368
Thank you for coming.

01:10:16.583 --> 01:10:19.072
- Mr. Price.
- Yes?

01:10:19.958 --> 01:10:24.165
- Henry Crawford. Friend of...
- ...Maria Bertram's.

01:10:24.375 --> 01:10:26.579
Pleased to meet you.

01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:30.119
And you must be Mrs. Price.

01:10:30.333 --> 01:10:34.990
I see the resemblance to your sisters,
Lady Bertram and Mrs. Norris.

01:10:35.208 --> 01:10:38.408
Your family has
no inconsiderable share of beauty.

01:10:38.625 --> 01:10:41.658
You're too kind, Mr. Crawford.

01:10:41.875 --> 01:10:43.581
Miss Price.

01:10:44.417 --> 01:10:46.242
Mr. Crawford.

01:10:46.958 --> 01:10:51.118
It was you, wasn't it?
The birds and everything...

01:10:51.333 --> 01:10:56.488
I'm sorry, I... do not know
to what you're referring.

01:11:01.917 --> 01:11:06.704
So, what is the news of Mansfield?
How is everyone?

01:11:06.917 --> 01:11:10.745
Everyone being Edmund...
Fanny, I know.

01:11:10.958 --> 01:11:14.904
- You know what, Henry?
- I know you love Edmund.

01:11:15.125 --> 01:11:17.578
I wish to speak in truths.

01:11:17.792 --> 01:11:22.283
It is the effect of your education of me,
Fanny Price.

01:11:24.792 --> 01:11:30.409
He is a fine man, I understand,
but he is to be married to my sister.

01:11:31.833 --> 01:11:33.907
The words have been spoken?

01:11:34.125 --> 01:11:36.162
All but.

01:11:37.667 --> 01:11:42.822
- I shall wait to grieve until then.
- You must grieve now.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.496
I know I have an appearance
of inauthenticity.

01:11:48.708 --> 01:11:55.036
You're infinitely my superior in merit,
you have touches of the angel in you.

01:11:55.250 --> 01:12:00.950
And I know you have witnessed
my insincere attentions toward Maria.

01:12:01.167 --> 01:12:06.404
But your eyes are so clear and
unflinching, please look at me again.

01:12:06.625 --> 01:12:08.616
I am changed, Fanny Price.

01:12:08.833 --> 01:12:12.080
I shall wait for you till the end of time.

01:12:12.292 --> 01:12:14.780
My constancy shall prove
that I am changed.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.200
It is your very changefulness
that frightens me.

01:12:18.417 --> 01:12:20.905
- You toy with me.
- No.

01:12:21.125 --> 01:12:25.617
Senseless as it is,
my heart is still full of another.

01:12:31.083 --> 01:12:33.536
Then I shall wait...

01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:37.451
...till it is free once more.

01:12:47.708 --> 01:12:50.457
"It is the habits of wealth that I fear."

01:12:50.667 --> 01:12:55.324
"Still, she is the only woman
whom I could ever think of as..."

01:12:56.833 --> 01:13:00.199
Go and sit down, Charlie,
I've got to read this letter.

01:13:00.417 --> 01:13:02.206
Susy, could you...?

01:13:09.125 --> 01:13:14.362
"Still, she is the only woman
whom I could ever think of as..."

01:13:15.833 --> 01:13:17.871
"...a wife."

01:14:09.125 --> 01:14:12.822
Where would your tenants go,
if we moved in?

01:14:13.042 --> 01:14:16.786
I've several apartments,
they'd be well-cared for.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.492
- It is a generous offer.
- The first of many, I hope.

01:14:42.108 --> 01:14:43.933
Fanny...

01:14:46.358 --> 01:14:47.685
Yes?

01:14:48.733 --> 01:14:51.980
I've been thinking, Fanny.

01:15:00.067 --> 01:15:04.523
There is no shame in wealth, my dear.

01:15:07.650 --> 01:15:13.729
- That depends on how it's arrived at.
- Frances! Come here!

01:15:17.983 --> 01:15:20.269
Just remember, Fanny...

01:15:21.692 --> 01:15:25.022
...I married for love.

01:15:42.650 --> 01:15:44.605
How does it feel to be home?

01:15:44.817 --> 01:15:48.313
Portsmouth is Portsmouth,
and Mansfield is home.

01:15:48.525 --> 01:15:51.476
You don't like to be near the water?

01:15:51.692 --> 01:15:53.730
Not without the means to float away on it.

01:15:53.942 --> 01:15:55.269
You have.

01:15:55.483 --> 01:16:01.148
Poverty frightens me.
A woman's poverty is harsher than a man's.

01:16:01.358 --> 01:16:03.396
Well, arguable.

01:16:04.483 --> 01:16:07.102
- It need not be your lot.
- I know.

01:16:07.317 --> 01:16:11.227
You can spend your days in comfort...
with me.

01:16:12.817 --> 01:16:15.484
- I know.
- You do?

01:16:16.275 --> 01:16:18.313
Yes.

01:16:26.067 --> 01:16:28.390
Is that a 'yes'?

01:16:31.233 --> 01:16:33.105
Yes.

01:16:43.817 --> 01:16:49.814
Is that the 'yes' I've heard a thousand
times in my heart but not from you?

01:16:58.858 --> 01:17:01.228
Fanny Price!

01:17:04.317 --> 01:17:09.686
You will learn to love me.
Say it again, please, say it!

01:17:11.067 --> 01:17:13.104
Yes!

01:17:57.983 --> 01:18:04.560
Good morning, Miss Price!
Good morning, my darling!

01:18:04.775 --> 01:18:08.899
- Stop, please! Stop it!
- Good morning.

01:18:16.275 --> 01:18:18.182
Charlie, come on.

01:18:20.025 --> 01:18:22.692
I spoke hastily.

01:18:25.608 --> 01:18:29.815
I've anguished over the matter,
and I feel that I cannot...

01:18:32.108 --> 01:18:34.597
I cannot marry you.

01:18:35.317 --> 01:18:38.315
I'm not prepared.

01:18:40.233 --> 01:18:44.641
- And when might you be prepared?
- I cannot say.

01:18:45.858 --> 01:18:48.642
When might that be?

01:18:49.567 --> 01:18:52.482
I still doubt you and cannot trust you.

01:18:52.692 --> 01:18:54.730
Doubt me?

01:18:56.317 --> 01:19:01.353
Your behaviour is that of someone
trustworthy, the standard of trust?

01:19:01.567 --> 01:19:03.190
Forgive me.

01:19:04.942 --> 01:19:07.810
Enjoy your stay in Portsmouth, Miss Price.

01:19:09.942 --> 01:19:14.101
May it be long...
and up to your standards.

01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:18.727
Henry...

01:19:39.733 --> 01:19:42.517
Are you certain?

01:19:42.733 --> 01:19:45.814
I have no talent for certainty, Susy.

01:20:06.483 --> 01:20:08.888
Fanny, come quickly.

01:20:09.108 --> 01:20:10.649
Fanny...

01:20:10.858 --> 01:20:14.306
Who's to pay for all this paper, Fanny?

01:20:14.525 --> 01:20:15.899
Come, come.

01:20:25.983 --> 01:20:27.524
Edmund...

01:20:28.275 --> 01:20:32.316
I've come to take you back to Mansfield.
You're needed there.

01:20:34.025 --> 01:20:38.729
- What's happened?
- Tom was celebrating and fell ill.

01:20:38.942 --> 01:20:43.434
The group he was travelling with
left him to recover with Yates...

01:20:43.650 --> 01:20:46.352
...who then deserted him as well.

01:20:46.567 --> 01:20:49.565
He was found almost dead two days ago.

01:20:50.275 --> 01:20:52.313
The situation is very grave.

01:20:53.650 --> 01:20:56.399
We must hurry.

01:20:56.608 --> 01:20:58.764
If you wish to, that is.

01:21:05.817 --> 01:21:08.934
Fanny, I cannot tell you how much I...

01:21:09.650 --> 01:21:13.644
- I shall see you soon, Susy, I feel it.
- Go on, now!

01:21:14.942 --> 01:21:19.765
Remember: "Run mad as often
as you choose, but do not faint!"

01:21:35.858 --> 01:21:38.939
I trust, other than this tragedy,
you're well?

01:21:39.817 --> 01:21:42.021
Yes...

01:21:42.233 --> 01:21:45.314
As I intimated in my last letter,

01:21:45.525 --> 01:21:51.522
I believe Mary has almost reconciled
herself to marrying a stodgy clergyman.

01:21:58.108 --> 01:22:01.189
I understand Crawford paid you a visit.

01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:02.857
Yes.

01:22:03.983 --> 01:22:06.685
And was he attentive?

01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:10.230
Yes...
Very.

01:22:13.900 --> 01:22:16.898
And has your heart changed towards him?

01:22:19.358 --> 01:22:21.064
Yes...

01:22:21.275 --> 01:22:23.396
Several times.

01:22:25.942 --> 01:22:29.308
I have...
I find that I...

01:22:30.858 --> 01:22:32.648
I find that...

01:22:36.025 --> 01:22:41.180
Surely you and I are beyond speaking,
when words are clearly not enough.

01:22:47.025 --> 01:22:48.897
I missed you.

01:22:51.192 --> 01:22:53.478
And I you.

01:24:11.192 --> 01:24:15.351
- Fanny, you're back.
- Yes, sir.

01:24:15.567 --> 01:24:20.687
Good. We've had our fill
of estrangement at Mansfield Park.

01:24:35.275 --> 01:24:36.602
Water.

01:24:47.275 --> 01:24:50.226
The light... please.

01:24:55.483 --> 01:24:58.054
- Morning, sir.
- Dear Mr. Crawford.

01:24:58.275 --> 01:25:04.556
Thank you for joining us at this difficult
time. Maria will be joining us later.

01:25:04.775 --> 01:25:08.354
Mr. Rushworth is detained
with improvements to Sotherton.

01:25:08.567 --> 01:25:13.059
- Miss Julia is due within the hour.
- Welcome.

01:25:13.275 --> 01:25:16.143
- Fanny.
- Thank you for coming.

01:25:16.358 --> 01:25:22.473
Fanny, I've been meaning to ask you,
how long are you staying?

01:25:23.317 --> 01:25:27.809
I'm not certain, Aunt Norris.
And how long are you staying?

01:26:24.692 --> 01:26:26.730
Mrs. Rushworth...

01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:31.604
- I trust you are well?
- I'm fine.

01:26:31.817 --> 01:26:34.140
And Mr. Rushworth?

01:26:35.067 --> 01:26:37.022
Maria...

01:26:39.650 --> 01:26:44.556
Is this the behaviour of friends?
Maria... Please...

01:26:44.775 --> 01:26:46.849
How's Fanny?

01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:52.889
She's a good little girl.

01:26:54.983 --> 01:26:58.811
And you've become a good little boy?

01:27:06.525 --> 01:27:09.606
She's rejected me, Maria.

01:27:19.067 --> 01:27:22.480
Would that this sigh were for me...

01:28:29.858 --> 01:28:32.263
My son is mad.

01:28:34.233 --> 01:28:36.722
Go to your room!

01:28:36.942 --> 01:28:39.063
Get out!

01:30:21.642 --> 01:30:25.422
Fanny, what is it? What?
What's wrong?

01:30:25.642 --> 01:30:26.969
What?

01:30:43.100 --> 01:30:47.390
Don't look at me like that Edmund.
Rushworth's a fool, and I can't get out.

01:30:48.725 --> 01:30:50.632
Edmund...

01:30:51.308 --> 01:30:53.595
I can't get out.

01:31:37.558 --> 01:31:39.596
You all right?

01:31:46.475 --> 01:31:49.094
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

01:32:04.892 --> 01:32:07.594
Good morning, Mansfield Park!

01:32:07.808 --> 01:32:09.598
Come!

01:32:20.475 --> 01:32:24.931
Get Edmund, Sir Thomas and Maria.
We have an important guest here.

01:32:25.142 --> 01:32:29.052
Edmund!
This is Mr. Dixon of the 'London Times'.

01:32:29.267 --> 01:32:35.097
He is writing an article about modern
gardens and is interested in Sotherton.

01:32:35.308 --> 01:32:36.931
Where's Maria?

01:32:37.142 --> 01:32:42.048
He has noticed the influence of Gilpin.
He loves the new ruins.

01:32:42.267 --> 01:32:45.798
Wake up, you degenerate lot!
Hello!

01:32:46.017 --> 01:32:48.636
- Maria?
- Sir... Sir!

01:33:02.183 --> 01:33:06.675
- Where's Maria?
- I could not say...

01:33:07.517 --> 01:33:09.389
At this hour?

01:33:11.267 --> 01:33:13.387
We'll speak to Crawford.

01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:18.387
It was recommendation to remove
the avenue of oaks from the west front,

01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:22.179
up to the top of the hill.

01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:30.136
- Where is Crawford?
- At the parsonage with the Grants.

01:33:33.017 --> 01:33:36.430
No, we... stopped there first.

01:33:53.642 --> 01:33:55.549
Sir Thomas...

01:33:55.767 --> 01:33:59.631
There's something you must read.
Oh, dear, dear...

01:33:59.850 --> 01:34:05.052
It is... quite startling.
Here, in the society section.

01:34:11.933 --> 01:34:14.635
Fanny...

01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:17.839
You read it to us.

01:34:18.058 --> 01:34:21.969
You have such a strong, clear voice.

01:34:34.308 --> 01:34:38.172
"It is with infinite concern
we have to announce that..."

01:34:38.392 --> 01:34:44.424
"...a matrimonial fracas in the family
of Mr. Rushworth of Wimpole Street."

01:34:46.100 --> 01:34:47.427
Go on.

01:34:48.392 --> 01:34:49.968
"The beautiful Mrs. Rushworth,"

01:34:50.183 --> 01:34:53.715
"who was to be so brilliant a leader
in the fashionable world,"

01:34:53.933 --> 01:34:59.716
"has quitted her husband's roof
for the captivating Mr. Crawford,"

01:34:59.933 --> 01:35:03.180
"the intimate friend
of not only Mr. Rushworth,"

01:35:03.392 --> 01:35:08.677
"but Mrs. Rushworth's father,
Sir Thomas Bertram of Mansfield Park."

01:35:08.892 --> 01:35:14.047
"it is not known even to the editor
whither they have gone."

01:35:14.267 --> 01:35:16.802
May God help us.

01:35:20.392 --> 01:35:23.722
The fools!
Under this roof!

01:35:23.933 --> 01:35:28.341
They should've known Rushworth
would bring in a newspaper man.

01:35:28.558 --> 01:35:33.097
Under which roof
would it have been better, Mary?

01:35:33.308 --> 01:35:37.219
I understand your bitterness,
but do not direct it at me.

01:35:37.433 --> 01:35:39.839
Your brother is an actor.

01:35:40.058 --> 01:35:43.673
A charming inscrutable actor,
through and through.

01:35:43.892 --> 01:35:49.426
The temptation of quick pleasure was
too strong for one unused to sacrifices.

01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:56.132
After all the cost and care of an
anxious and expensive education,

01:35:56.350 --> 01:35:59.597
I do not feel I know
my own children at all.

01:35:59.808 --> 01:36:03.055
Now, please, of course you know them.

01:36:03.267 --> 01:36:06.632
This is 1806, for heaven's sake!

01:36:06.850 --> 01:36:11.306
This is not the first time, nor the last,
such a thing will happen.

01:36:11.517 --> 01:36:13.140
Look...

01:36:13.350 --> 01:36:16.301
You are indeed a family in distress,

01:36:16.517 --> 01:36:20.096
but you must recover
and survive gracefully.

01:36:21.975 --> 01:36:25.471
If Henry does not choose to marry Maria,

01:36:25.683 --> 01:36:29.049
and if you also reject her,
she will be an outcast.

01:36:29.267 --> 01:36:32.348
A leaf in the wind of other men's plans.

01:36:32.558 --> 01:36:34.099
Or...

01:36:35.475 --> 01:36:37.679
We can recover.

01:36:39.308 --> 01:36:41.512
Here is my proposal...

01:36:41.725 --> 01:36:44.889
We must persuade Henry to marry Maria.

01:36:45.100 --> 01:36:48.548
After a respectable period,
Edmund and I will accept them

01:36:48.767 --> 01:36:52.760
into our acquaintance...
and household.

01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:03.134
Then you all, after an appropriate
period, will properly support them, too.

01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:07.011
The Bertrams, being people
of respectability, as they are,

01:37:07.225 --> 01:37:11.681
she may recover her footing in society
to a certain degree.

01:37:11.892 --> 01:37:16.134
In some circles, she'd never be
admitted, but with dinners and parties...

01:37:16.350 --> 01:37:18.969
...some people will like her acquaintance.

01:37:19.183 --> 01:37:20.759
Such a strategy.

01:37:20.975 --> 01:37:26.130
And how will a poor clergyman
afford these dinners and parties?

01:37:26.350 --> 01:37:28.921
Chance is not always unkind.

01:37:31.433 --> 01:37:34.431
I beg your pardon.

01:37:36.267 --> 01:37:39.134
If Tom is not able to recover,

01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:41.885
Edmund will be the heir.

01:37:42.100 --> 01:37:46.176
Wealth and consequence could fall
into hands no more deserving.

01:37:56.850 --> 01:38:00.511
I understand you think
I should not say such things.

01:38:00.725 --> 01:38:04.137
But one must prepare oneself
for every eventuality.

01:38:04.350 --> 01:38:06.803
It is the mark of an evolved individual.

01:38:07.017 --> 01:38:12.765
I advise that you, Sir Thomas, do not
injure your cause by interference.

01:38:12.975 --> 01:38:15.049
Let things take their course.

01:38:15.267 --> 01:38:17.506
That may be a difficult thing,

01:38:17.725 --> 01:38:22.678
but although Tom, bless his heart, may
not be strong enough for this world,

01:38:22.892 --> 01:38:25.641
the rest of us must be.

01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:32.345
I speak merely of what must be done,
not what I feel.

01:38:32.558 --> 01:38:37.050
You may wish to reconsider
your eagerness for Tom's death.

01:38:37.267 --> 01:38:41.509
You may wish to reconsider
your thinly-veiled anger towards me!

01:38:43.642 --> 01:38:48.015
If you'd accepted my brother,
you'd be now on the point of marriage,

01:38:48.225 --> 01:38:51.804
and Henry would not be
on terms with Mrs. Rushworth.

01:38:52.017 --> 01:38:54.932
It would have ended in a regular flirtation

01:38:55.142 --> 01:38:58.010
in meetings at Sotherton and Everingham.

01:38:58.225 --> 01:39:02.089
It could all be construed as your fault.

01:39:05.100 --> 01:39:08.679
Your startling adaptability
to my brother's possible demise

01:39:08.892 --> 01:39:12.885
sends a chill through my heart.

01:39:13.475 --> 01:39:15.761
A chill...

01:39:18.350 --> 01:39:21.716
You're cheerfully planning parties
with his money!

01:39:21.933 --> 01:39:25.594
You shush my father
like a dog at your table.

01:39:25.808 --> 01:39:31.841
You attack Fanny for following her own
infallible guide on matters of the heart.

01:39:32.058 --> 01:39:37.011
All this has grievously convinced me
that the person I've so dwelt on

01:39:37.225 --> 01:39:39.714
has been a creature of my own imagination!

01:39:42.183 --> 01:39:44.257
Not you, Miss Crawford...

01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:48.681
You are a stranger to me.

01:39:50.892 --> 01:39:55.679
I do not know you, and I'm sorry to say,
I have no wish to.

01:40:28.850 --> 01:40:31.303
Is there anything to be done?

01:40:31.517 --> 01:40:33.223
Wait...

01:40:35.100 --> 01:40:37.932
- Wait?
- Yes.

01:40:38.142 --> 01:40:41.389
Time can do almost anything.

01:40:51.058 --> 01:40:53.344
He'll be all right.

01:41:01.017 --> 01:41:04.678
He survived brain fever when he was six.

01:41:11.433 --> 01:41:14.597
He used to play 'Tom the Knight'.

01:41:16.517 --> 01:41:20.048
"Give me a mission, Father," he'd say.

01:41:21.642 --> 01:41:25.470
I'd send him with a message to mother
about the tea or...

01:41:26.350 --> 01:41:29.965
...to get Baddeley
to get the carriage ready.

01:41:30.850 --> 01:41:32.887
"No, Father..."

01:41:34.892 --> 01:41:37.261
"Give me a noble mission."

01:41:44.392 --> 01:41:47.259
That's all he ever wanted.

01:42:02.225 --> 01:42:04.630
I'm sorry, Tom.

01:42:08.933 --> 01:42:10.343
I'm so sorry.

01:42:40.017 --> 01:42:42.766
"In good and perfect time,"

01:42:42.975 --> 01:42:45.843
"Tom's health did return."

01:42:46.058 --> 01:42:49.969
"Henry Crawford chose
not to marry Maria."

01:42:51.308 --> 01:42:55.053
"Mrs. Norris, who Sir Thomas
came to regard as an evil,"

01:42:55.267 --> 01:42:59.806
"went to devote herself
to her... unfortunate niece."

01:43:01.392 --> 01:43:07.057
"It may be supposed that their tempers
became their mutual punishment."

01:43:08.392 --> 01:43:12.516
"It could have turned out differently,
I suppose."

01:43:16.225 --> 01:43:19.057
"But it didn't."

01:43:44.558 --> 01:43:48.173
"Mary Crawford went to live
in Westminster."

01:43:48.392 --> 01:43:52.930
"Eventually, she and Henry found
partners who shared their more..."

01:43:53.142 --> 01:43:56.223
"...modern sensibilities."

01:44:07.183 --> 01:44:09.672
"And... as you may have guessed,"

01:44:09.892 --> 01:44:15.225
"exactly when it was natural that
it should be so, not a moment sooner,"

01:44:15.433 --> 01:44:20.386
"Edmund came to speak the whole
delightful... and astonishing truth."

01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:23.764
Fanny, I must confess something.

01:44:31.892 --> 01:44:34.890
I've loved you all my life.

01:44:35.100 --> 01:44:37.719
I know, Edmund.

01:44:43.517 --> 01:44:45.140
No, Fanny...

01:44:47.058 --> 01:44:50.140
As a man loves a woman.

01:44:54.808 --> 01:44:57.889
As a hero loves a heroine.

01:45:02.183 --> 01:45:06.426
As I've never loved anyone
in my entire life.

01:45:10.308 --> 01:45:13.969
I was so anxious to do what is right...

01:45:14.933 --> 01:45:17.386
...that I forgot to do what is right.

01:45:19.058 --> 01:45:21.807
But if you choose me,

01:45:22.683 --> 01:45:26.593
after all my blundering and blindness,

01:45:29.517 --> 01:45:34.387
that will be a happiness
which no description could reach.

01:45:36.058 --> 01:45:37.515
Edmund.

01:46:16.308 --> 01:46:20.930
Looks as though
they're finally getting somewhere.

01:46:22.725 --> 01:46:24.383
Hello!

01:46:26.100 --> 01:46:27.427
Julia...

01:46:30.350 --> 01:46:33.182
Mr... Yates?

01:46:33.392 --> 01:46:39.424
Now, Joan of Arc lived
during the reign of Henry... VI?

01:46:39.642 --> 01:46:42.805
- Is that correct?
- Yes, Susy.

01:46:43.017 --> 01:46:46.762
I knew that, yes, I did.
I knew that.

01:46:46.975 --> 01:46:50.008
"Susan came to live
at Mansfield Park."

01:46:50.225 --> 01:46:52.299
"Tom grew stronger by the day."

01:46:52.517 --> 01:46:56.214
"Sir Thomas eventually
abandoned his pursuits in Antigua."

01:46:56.433 --> 01:47:01.671
"He chose to pursue some
exciting new opportunities in..."

01:47:01.892 --> 01:47:04.013
"...tobacco."

01:47:09.058 --> 01:47:13.348
"It could have all turned out differently,
I suppose."

01:47:14.517 --> 01:47:16.970
"But it didn't."

01:47:19.683 --> 01:47:24.636
By the way,
I spoke to a John Ward at Edgerton's,

01:47:24.850 --> 01:47:29.140
- He said he'd be willing to publish.
- My stories?

01:47:29.350 --> 01:47:34.588
At our expense, of course,
but you'd keep 10% of the profits.

01:47:36.017 --> 01:47:38.054
I was thinking of a title.

01:47:38.267 --> 01:47:43.552
"Effusions of fancy by a very young girl
in a style entirely new."

01:47:44.475 --> 01:47:48.883
- What do you think?
- That's... very interesting!

01:47:50.225 --> 01:47:51.766
- Just interesting?
- It's terrible!

01:47:51.975 --> 01:47:54.594
That's a terrible name!

01:47:54.808 --> 01:47:57.297
But you're lovely.

01:47:57.517 --> 01:48:00.550
Well, I guess that's all right, then!
