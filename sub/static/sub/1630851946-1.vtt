was my old English teacher.

would literally kill her.

that ensnared me.

-We don't have to talk shop at breakfast.
-Oh, but it's so fascinating.

32:48.208 --> 32:50.500
And all the travel that it must involve.

32:50.583 --> 32:53.083
Well, if you count
lunch runs to Applebee's,

32:53.166 --> 32:54.750
then Josh travels every day.

32:57.458 --> 32:58.583

33:02.416 --> 33:05.500
You know, I've been thinking about joining
one of those dating sites.

33:05.583 --> 33:06.875

she joined one called Gray Play,

33:10.416 --> 33:13.916
and she has seen more ass
than a church pew.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.041
-Okay, June! Seriously.

33:16.125 --> 33:17.416
[Barb] Let's just… [laughs]

33:17.500 --> 33:20.500

-Oh. Um…
-Yeah.

33:21.916 --> 33:22.750
-Okay.
-Sure.

33:22.833 --> 33:26.166
May I see yours?
And can you show me Josh's?

33:27.333 --> 33:29.791
-I didn't bring my phone. It's downstairs.
-Maybe later, Grams.

33:29.875 --> 33:31.750
Yeah. Natalie and I have to head out.

33:31.833 --> 33:35.208
Uh, I'm gonna show her a grand tour
of Lake Placid and the store.

33:35.291 --> 33:37.916
-Oh. That's a great idea. Fun.
-[Josh] Mm-hmm. Yeah.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.833
-[Barb] Take your toast.
-[Bob] Drive carefully.

33:39.916 --> 33:41.000

"rappel" and "harness."

38:34.666 --> 38:36.458
Why did you stop being friends?

38:36.541 --> 38:38.666
[sighs] Because he got popular.

38:39.500 --> 38:40.583

38:41.208 --> 38:42.083
Didn't.

39:32.833 --> 39:33.750
Okay.

39:34.416 --> 39:36.625

39:36.708 --> 39:38.458
Yes, it's one of her hobbies.

39:40.083 --> 39:41.625
Josh Lin?

39:41.708 --> 39:43.333
All right, fine, they're mine.

39:43.416 --> 39:47.125
Guys can do things
besides hunt and pay for everything, okay?

39:47.208 --> 39:50.458

as a business than a hobby.

39:51.041 --> 39:52.625
-All right.
-Wait, hey, hey, whoa, whoa!

39:52.708 --> 39:54.875
-Let's see what you got. [grunts]
-Come on!

39:54.958 --> 39:55.916
[straining] Okay.

39:58.500 --> 39:59.333
Oh.

39:59.416 --> 40:02.458
You see, candles
are solely marketed to women.

40:02.541 --> 40:05.000
They all smell like flowers and candy

40:05.083 --> 40:08.833
with names like "Sweet Caresses"
or "Shooting Star."

40:08.916 --> 40:11.333
No self-respecting man's gonna buy those,

40:11.416 --> 40:13.958
even if his apartment
smells like bong water.

40:14.041 --> 40:18.916
So, I created my own line
of masculine candles

40:19.000 --> 40:21.250
that captures the essence of a dude.

40:21.333 --> 40:24.416
Yeah, I don't see "Compulsive Liar,"

40:24.500 --> 40:27.208
"Left The Toilet Seat Up,"
or "Won't Ask For Directions" in here.

40:27.291 --> 40:29.000
Make all the jokes you want,

40:29.083 --> 40:32.375
but 50 percent of the US candle market
is underserved.

40:32.458 --> 40:34.250
So, then why don't you serve them?

40:34.333 --> 40:36.041
Because a business costs money.

40:36.125 --> 40:39.250
Then ask your dad for a loan.
I feel like he's the target customer.

40:39.333 --> 40:40.625
-Have you met him?
-Yeah.

40:40.708 --> 40:42.833
-The old Asian man upstairs?
-Oh yeah.

40:42.916 --> 40:46.083
[Josh] He's only interested in sporty,
manly things.

40:46.166 --> 40:50.125
Plus, he and my brother
would just tease me about it.

-No.
-Ah! She must be in Mom's new book club.

41:48.125 --> 41:50.916
-No, she is--
-[Owen] Oh shit. Shit. Uh…

41:51.666 --> 41:53.125
Is this another intervention?

No, honey.
Natalie is your brother's girlfriend.

-[Josh] Mm-hmm.

42:05.875 --> 42:10.125
Oh! Well, that is awesome.

42:10.916 --> 42:13.750
Yeah, we-- You know,
we were just saying in the car, right?

42:13.833 --> 42:16.708
-We were just talking about it.
-We talked about this for hours.

42:16.791 --> 42:19.625
-[Chelsea] Yeah. Yeah.
-[Owen] How is Joshy still single?

42:19.708 --> 42:21.833
Yeah, I mean, granted,
he still lives at home,

42:21.916 --> 42:24.333
and the glasses
aren't doing him any favors.

42:24.416 --> 42:25.583

-[Barb] What a beautiful voice, Natalie!

53:23.250 --> 53:25.708
-Oh no. No, I don't.
-It was wonderful! [laughing]

53:25.791 --> 53:28.000
Okay, okay.
I think… I think we should tell them.

53:28.083 --> 53:30.666
-It's time to tell them. Let's tell them.
-I think it's time. Okay.

53:30.750 --> 53:33.458
-Can I have your attention? Please?
-[Barb] So clever--

53:34.916 --> 53:39.500
Uh. You know, we… we were gonna wait
to tell everyone the great news, but…

53:39.583 --> 53:43.500
[chuckles] after hearing all this singing
about babies,

53:43.583 --> 53:46.458
we just got so darn excited, and, uh,

53:46.541 --> 53:50.750
[inhales] uh, we just couldn't
keep it to ourselves anymore. Um…

53:51.791 --> 53:53.250
Mom? Dad?

53:54.750 --> 53:57.333
-You're gonna be grandparents.
-We're pregnant.

-Oh wow!

54:00.333 --> 54:02.125
Oh, son!

Oh, come here, come here.
Come on, come on, Grandma.

54:11.125 --> 54:14.541
-[Barb] I'm so proud of you.
-We gotta come up with some names.

54:14.625 --> 54:15.625
[Owen] Mom!

54:15.708 --> 54:17.375
This is gonna be so much fun.

54:17.458 --> 54:20.416
We're gonna do the bedroom,
we're gonna do the nursery room.

54:20.500 --> 54:22.958
-[indistinct chatter]
-[Barb] Oh my--

54:23.041 --> 54:25.250
May I have everyone's attention, please?

54:25.333 --> 54:28.125
May I… may I have
everyone's attention, please?

54:29.125 --> 54:33.041
Owen and Chelsea,
I just wanna say congratulations.

54:33.541 --> 54:39.125
Seeing you guys so happy in love
and now pregnant. [chuckles]

54:39.208 --> 54:41.750
I mean, it's a… it's a dream come true.

54:42.333 --> 54:44.875
It's a dream
I never dared to have for myself.

54:44.958 --> 54:47.458
Finding someone
to spend the rest of my life with.

54:47.958 --> 54:50.291
It just didn't really seem
to be in the cards…

54:52.083 --> 54:53.291
until I met Natalie.

54:53.791 --> 54:54.666
Hmm?

54:57.125 --> 54:58.375
-[Barb gasps]
-[Owen] Oh no.

54:58.458 --> 54:59.291
[neighbors gasp]

54:59.375 --> 55:00.541
What are you doing?

55:01.583 --> 55:02.416
Get up.

55:02.500 --> 55:06.625
Natalie. I… I know we haven't known
each other for that long--

55:06.708 --> 55:08.291
No, we haven't. We really haven't.

55:08.375 --> 55:12.833
But you know what they say.
When you know, you know.

55:12.916 --> 55:16.625
[laughing nervously] I'm serious.
[straining] This is not funny.

55:17.416 --> 55:18.250
Natalie Bauer.

55:18.333 --> 55:19.833
Stop it. Get up.

55:19.916 --> 55:21.333
-Will you marry me?
-[Barb gasps]

55:21.416 --> 55:22.541
Stop--

55:22.625 --> 55:24.041
He doesn't even have a ring.

55:24.125 --> 55:25.833
Yeah, you don't have a ring.

55:25.916 --> 55:29.333
[whispering] Say yes.
Just say yes. Just say it.

55:29.916 --> 55:30.750
Jesus Christ.

55:30.833 --> 55:33.666
You can take mine.
I don't have to be buried with it.

55:33.750 --> 55:35.250
Oh, thank you, Grandma.

55:35.333 --> 55:37.125
You're the best!

55:37.208 --> 55:38.458
[chuckles nervously]

55:38.541 --> 55:39.583
Natalie.

55:40.458 --> 55:41.375
Will you?

55:41.458 --> 55:43.625
[whispering] Come on.
Everybody's looking at us.

55:43.708 --> 55:45.291
-Say yes!
-Yes! Yes!

55:46.916 --> 55:49.000
[Josh whispering] Everyone's looking.
Just say yes.

55:49.083 --> 55:51.166
We're not getting any younger, dear.

55:52.750 --> 55:53.583
Yes.

55:53.666 --> 55:55.041
-[all cheering]
-She said yes!

55:55.125 --> 55:56.625
[Bob] Oh my God!

55:58.625 --> 56:01.458
-Oh my God.
-[Barb] Oh my goodness!

56:01.541 --> 56:03.083
Oh, it fits perfect!

56:03.166 --> 56:04.541
-[Bob] Oh!
-Oh!

56:04.625 --> 56:09.041
You're making me the happiest boy--
We're the happiest family in town!

56:09.125 --> 56:11.833
-[Barb] Welcome to the family, Natalie.
-[Josh] Oh, thank you, Grandma.

56:11.916 --> 56:14.291
-Oh!
-[Owen] It's crazy!

56:14.375 --> 56:17.125
[Josh] I'm the happiest man in town.
Thank you. Thank you, everyone.

56:17.708 --> 56:20.291
-[door closes]
-Okay. I… I know you're mad,

56:20.375 --> 56:22.916
but you told me to stand up for myself,
and… and it worked!

56:23.000 --> 56:25.708
I told you to stand up,
not get down on one knee!

56:25.791 --> 56:27.833
This was not part of the plan.

56:27.916 --> 56:29.875
I'm… I'm sorry.
I got carried away in the moment.

56:29.958 --> 56:32.458
But if you think about it,
nothing's changed.

56:32.541 --> 56:34.166
Nothing's changed?

56:34.250 --> 56:35.958
Your grandma gave me her ring

56:36.041 --> 56:37.541
[shouting] off of her finger!

56:37.625 --> 56:39.458
Still, we just gotta
make it through Christmas.

56:39.541 --> 56:42.166
When you get back to LA,
I just tell them we didn't work out.

56:42.250 --> 56:45.833
And then I look like the asshole?
Your family is gonna be crushed.

56:45.916 --> 56:48.500
Don't worry. They're very used
to me disappointing them.

56:48.583 --> 56:51.208
What about Tag?
I have a date with him tomorrow.

56:51.291 --> 56:53.375
What if he finds out
I'm engaged to my cousin?

56:53.458 --> 56:56.166
He won't. I promise you that. Okay?

56:56.250 --> 56:58.916
Everything will be fine. Just trust me.

56:59.833 --> 57:01.666
Tr… trust you? [scoffs]

57:01.750 --> 57:04.708
That is literally
the one thing that I cannot do!

57:05.791 --> 57:07.500
[Natalie] I even wore this stupid hat!

57:07.583 --> 57:10.083
You wanted me to wear a hat.
You're like, "It's cute." It's dumb!

57:10.166 --> 57:12.666
[door opens] Now I'm apparently
getting married! [door slams]

57:12.750 --> 57:15.041
-[sighs deeply]
-[Owen] I don't know about this Natalie.

57:15.125 --> 57:17.875
If she wants to be in our family,
I need to know who she is.

57:17.958 --> 57:18.833
And I've been,

57:18.916 --> 57:22.000
[chuckles] I've been searching
for like an hour and nothing.

57:22.500 --> 57:25.458
[clicks tongue] Not being Google-able
is the modern equivalent

57:25.541 --> 57:28.125
of driving a white,
windowless van by a playground.

57:28.875 --> 57:31.416
I went to prom in a white windowless van.

57:32.333 --> 57:33.166
Huh?

57:33.791 --> 57:35.625
I think you should just let it go.

57:35.708 --> 57:39.083
I mean, she's not that bad,
and Josh seems really into her.

57:39.916 --> 57:43.791
Chels, the baby barely has a heartbeat,
let alone ears.

57:43.875 --> 57:46.291
Music prevents stretch marks, Owen.

57:46.375 --> 57:47.708
[Kerry] Let me get this straight.

57:47.791 --> 57:51.041
You're dating the real Tag,
and you're engaged to the fake Tag?

57:51.125 --> 57:51.958
Correct.

57:52.041 --> 57:54.958
My God, honey, you are gonna make
a therapist very wealthy one day.

57:55.041 --> 57:56.666
[Natalie] This isn't funny, Ker!

57:56.750 --> 57:58.541
I am so screwed!

57:58.625 --> 58:01.000
[Kerry] All you have to do
is make sure Tag and the Lins

58:01.083 --> 58:03.541
don't find out anything before Christmas,
and you're golden.

58:03.625 --> 58:05.416
Just sit back, enjoy it.

58:05.500 --> 58:06.875
[Natalie] I don't know, Ker.

58:06.958 --> 58:09.208
I feel like this
is gonna blow up in my face.

58:09.291 --> 58:11.541
[Kerry] Honey, sometimes blow-ups
can be a good thing.

58:11.625 --> 58:13.666
You might not always
get the ending you want,

58:13.750 --> 58:15.416
but you'll get the ending you need.

58:15.500 --> 58:18.666
-Worst case, you get a free diamond ring.
-[call waiting beeps]

58:19.625 --> 58:23.583
Oh. Hey… hey, Nat. Sweetie, I love you,
but I gotta go. My sponsor's calling.

58:23.666 --> 58:25.500
Bye, sweetie. Love you.

58:25.583 --> 58:26.416
Hey.

58:27.625 --> 58:28.458
Kerry?

58:30.125 --> 58:30.958
[scoffs]

58:32.625 --> 58:33.708
[shivering]

58:34.958 --> 58:36.000
[Bob grunts]

58:38.291 --> 58:39.458
Is everything okay?

58:40.125 --> 58:44.083
Oh, uh, Natalie,
can you please hand me my… my wrench?

58:44.625 --> 58:45.916
[clicks tongue] Uh, yeah.

58:46.750 --> 58:47.833
-Here.
-[Bob] Thanks.

58:48.333 --> 58:49.166
No problem.

58:49.875 --> 58:51.500
[grunts] Got it.

58:52.333 --> 58:53.333
Whew.

58:54.291 --> 58:56.208
Damn flue always gets stuck.

58:57.041 --> 58:57.958
[Bob exhales]

58:59.125 --> 59:01.625
Oh, would you like
to help me with kindling?

59:02.416 --> 59:03.250
Sure.

59:03.750 --> 59:05.333
[Bob grunts]

59:10.666 --> 59:15.291
Just roll it lightly and scrunch.

59:16.125 --> 59:16.958
[Bob chuckles]

59:17.041 --> 59:21.041
Yeah, my dad didn't set fires unless
there was an insurance claim involved.

59:21.958 --> 59:23.208
Who's that?

59:23.958 --> 59:24.875
Oh.

59:25.625 --> 59:27.041
Oh, that's my dad.

59:27.750 --> 59:29.708
Yeah. He passed a few years ago.

59:29.791 --> 59:30.916
Oh, I'm…

59:31.791 --> 59:33.125
-[Bob] Oh.
-I'm sorry.

59:34.083 --> 59:37.333
You know,
that man loved two things in this world,

59:37.416 --> 59:39.708
his family and Christmas.

59:39.791 --> 59:43.166
He used to climb up on the roof
every Christmas Eve and stomp around

59:43.250 --> 59:45.291
so the boys knew Santa had arrived.

59:45.375 --> 59:47.791
-He fell off one year and broke his arm.
-[gasps]

59:47.875 --> 59:52.208
But he told the boys he broke it,
protecting their presents from the Grinch.

59:52.291 --> 59:53.750
[both laugh]

59:56.083 --> 59:58.166
He sounds like a great guy.

59:58.250 --> 59:59.125
Yeah.

1:00:00.375 --> 1:00:01.666
Hey, listen, um…

1:00:01.750 --> 1:00:03.541
I just wanted you to know that

1:00:04.666 --> 1:00:08.000
we're really happy
to have you joining the family.

1:00:12.791 --> 1:00:13.791
[exhales deeply]

1:00:15.250 --> 1:00:17.833
Okay. Well, enough of that. [chuckles]

1:00:17.916 --> 1:00:19.875
Ready to give this bad boy a go?

1:00:20.666 --> 1:00:21.500
Sure.

1:00:21.583 --> 1:00:22.708
[Bob chuckles]

1:00:25.791 --> 1:00:27.625
Oh. Okay. All right.

1:00:28.208 --> 1:00:29.083
[birds squawking]

1:00:29.166 --> 1:00:32.000
[Natalie] This is the most beautiful hike
I've ever been on.

1:00:32.083 --> 1:00:33.458
[Tag] I'm glad you like it.

1:00:33.958 --> 1:00:36.875
I used to come here every day
with my golden retriever, Chewy.

1:00:36.958 --> 1:00:38.666
He passed away last year, actually.

1:00:38.750 --> 1:00:41.000
-I miss him every day.
-Mm.

1:00:41.583 --> 1:00:43.166
He would've liked this hike a lot…

1:00:43.250 --> 1:00:44.125
Mm.

1:00:45.625 --> 1:00:46.625
…and you.

1:00:54.083 --> 1:00:54.958
[chuckles]

1:00:55.625 --> 1:00:58.916
This has been nice.
I haven't been on a hike date in years.

1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:01.833
Oh, this is not the date.
It's just a warm-up.

1:01:03.041 --> 1:01:05.875
-You ever been bobsledding before?
-[rumbling]

1:01:07.125 --> 1:01:09.000
I'm not good at this kind of stuff, Josh.

1:01:09.083 --> 1:01:11.333
Okay. You just have to relax.

1:01:11.416 --> 1:01:15.416
Relax? I can't relax. The tension
is the only thing holding me together.

1:01:15.500 --> 1:01:18.041
Put in your AirPods,
and put on some music.

1:01:18.125 --> 1:01:20.041
I don't know if I have them.

1:01:22.291 --> 1:01:25.708
Actually, I think I have
something even better.

1:01:27.958 --> 1:01:30.958
Oh, um, E-Rock says "pass the dutch."

1:01:31.041 --> 1:01:32.291
E-Rock?

1:01:33.333 --> 1:01:34.666
When did he get out of jail?

1:01:34.750 --> 1:01:37.458
[Tag whooping]

1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:40.333
[screaming] Yeah!

1:01:40.416 --> 1:01:43.458
[continues whooping]

1:01:43.541 --> 1:01:46.083
How are you feeling back there, Natalie?

1:01:46.166 --> 1:01:48.291
[Natalie spacey] Flying high back here.

1:01:49.416 --> 1:01:51.416
[Tag whooping]

1:01:53.833 --> 1:01:54.750
[door closes]

1:01:54.833 --> 1:01:57.375
-[footsteps approaching]
-[Natalie humming]

1:01:58.875 --> 1:02:00.041
[Natalie sighs happily]

1:02:00.125 --> 1:02:02.250
[scoffs] Glad you're not dead.

1:02:02.333 --> 1:02:05.125
Oh! I've never felt more alive!

1:02:06.625 --> 1:02:09.958
Not only did Tag ask me to dinner
tomorrow night,

1:02:10.458 --> 1:02:14.125
but I'm pretty sure I qualified for
the winter Olympics in Beijing. [chuckles]

1:02:14.208 --> 1:02:15.750
Oh!

1:02:15.833 --> 1:02:17.333
[squeals]

1:02:17.416 --> 1:02:18.958
For the first time,

1:02:19.041 --> 1:02:21.791
I met someone who's as perfect in person

1:02:21.875 --> 1:02:25.166
as they are on paper. [chuckles, moans]

1:02:25.250 --> 1:02:28.791
I hate to break it to you, but Tag
is actually far from being perfect.

1:02:28.875 --> 1:02:32.458
In first grade, he had a lazy eye
and needed to wear an eye patch.

1:02:32.541 --> 1:02:35.125
[scoffs] Why are you being all weird?

1:02:35.916 --> 1:02:38.416
I'm just trying to point out
that in some cultures,

1:02:38.500 --> 1:02:41.458
height and facial symmetry are repulsive.

1:02:42.458 --> 1:02:45.708
[smacks lips] It's a good thing
I'm not part of those cultures.

1:13:09.541 --> 1:13:10.375
No.

1:13:10.916 --> 1:13:12.125
Stopped three years ago.

1:13:13.125 --> 1:13:16.333
-Why?
-Because it's a total scam.

1:13:16.916 --> 1:13:17.875
Okay.

1:13:18.583 --> 1:13:20.041
Really? [softly] Okay.

1:13:20.875 --> 1:13:22.750
[Natalie] Oh, uh, don't pull up
to the house.

1:13:22.833 --> 1:13:24.291
-Everyone's sleeping.
-[Tag] Okay.

1:13:24.375 --> 1:13:26.958
[Natalie] No offense,
but your car is a little loud.

1:13:27.875 --> 1:13:29.000
[Tag scoffs]

1:13:30.041 --> 1:13:30.916
Okay.

1:13:31.500 --> 1:13:33.583
Well, I had a really nice evening.

1:13:34.750 --> 1:13:35.750
I did too.

1:13:36.708 --> 1:13:37.833
Thank you.

1:13:55.333 --> 1:13:57.500
Thank you. Um…

1:13:58.833 --> 1:13:59.666
Good night.

1:14:00.708 --> 1:14:01.666
Good night.

1:14:04.416 --> 1:14:05.500
[door closes]

1:14:06.625 --> 1:14:08.916
[engine revving]

1:14:14.416 --> 1:14:15.500
[sighs]

1:14:17.125 --> 1:14:18.916
[soft guitar strumming]

1:14:39.375 --> 1:14:40.625
[Natalie groaning]

1:14:41.833 --> 1:14:43.250
There's cereal in there.

1:14:48.125 --> 1:14:51.250
Hey, Josh, listen.
About what I said last night, I--

1:14:51.333 --> 1:14:53.125
Look, you don't have to say anything.

1:14:53.208 --> 1:14:54.541
No, I want to.

1:14:55.375 --> 1:14:56.916
-[Grandma] Hey, kids.
-I shouldn't have--

1:14:57.000 --> 1:15:00.166
I need your help.
Go get dressed, and meet me at the car.

1:15:00.250 --> 1:15:01.208
Where are we going?

1:15:01.750 --> 1:15:03.041
Shimmering Pines.

1:15:03.750 --> 1:15:07.375
Come on, Grandma. Just ask Mom to help.
Okay? She loves that place.

1:15:07.458 --> 1:15:09.708
I don't need your mom. I need you.

1:15:09.791 --> 1:15:10.958
[chattering]

1:15:11.041 --> 1:15:14.500
We're starting now.
We're going to start now, everyone.

1:15:14.583 --> 1:15:16.750
We're going to be starting now.

1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:20.666
Many of you've expressed
interest in online dating.

1:15:21.250 --> 1:15:23.208
Well, I've brought you two experts.

1:15:23.291 --> 1:15:28.125
My grandson, Josh,
and his fiancée Natalie.

1:15:28.208 --> 1:15:29.458
[woman] Oh.

1:15:29.541 --> 1:15:33.166
They actually met online
and now are engaged.

1:15:33.250 --> 1:15:34.250
[group exclaiming]

1:15:34.333 --> 1:15:37.000
[Grandma] So, who better to come
and talk to you about

1:15:37.083 --> 1:15:39.333
the dos and don'ts of online dating?

1:15:40.416 --> 1:15:41.916
Any questions?

1:15:42.500 --> 1:15:43.833
How do I make it clear

1:15:43.916 --> 1:15:46.541
that I'm not looking
for anything long-term?

1:15:46.625 --> 1:15:47.583
[group] Yeah.

1:15:47.666 --> 1:15:50.000
Um… I… I think that might be implied.

1:15:50.083 --> 1:15:54.208
Do I have to mention my Parkinson's?

1:15:54.291 --> 1:15:57.333
I think being honest
is always a good idea.

1:15:57.416 --> 1:16:01.416
-[woman] Oh.
-What if I spruce it up just a little bit?

1:16:01.500 --> 1:16:04.458
Instead of "has Parkinson's,"

1:16:04.541 --> 1:16:06.291
I go with, uh,

1:16:07.291 --> 1:16:08.833
"Always on the move."

1:16:08.916 --> 1:16:11.333
-[group chuckling]
-Ooh, that's a good idea! I like that.

1:16:11.416 --> 1:16:14.166
I want to avoid mentioning
that I'm in a wheelchair.

1:16:14.250 --> 1:16:17.958
Then just change it.
Say, "I enjoy rolling with my homies."

1:16:18.041 --> 1:16:20.083
-Yeah! That's good.
-Oh, that sounds really good!

1:16:20.166 --> 1:16:22.583
Guys, I… I think you guys
got the wrong idea.

1:16:22.666 --> 1:16:26.875
And will the fact that I live
in a nursing home turn off a lot of men?

1:16:26.958 --> 1:16:29.000
-[Josh] Uh.
-Not necessarily.

1:16:29.083 --> 1:16:32.041
Just say, "Into the group thing."

1:16:32.125 --> 1:16:33.583
[group exclaiming]

1:16:33.666 --> 1:16:38.583
And then Hank there
would prefer staying in over going out.

1:16:38.666 --> 1:16:41.500
[group laughing, chattering]

1:16:44.333 --> 1:16:46.708
Stop. Stop.
[spluttering] Everyone just stop.

1:16:46.791 --> 1:16:48.041
[group quiets]

1:16:49.500 --> 1:16:50.583
[Josh] I… I get it.

1:16:50.666 --> 1:16:53.125
I… I really, really do.

1:16:54.166 --> 1:16:56.125
You wanna put your best foot forward.

1:16:57.208 --> 1:17:01.083
You lived a full, vibrant life,
and you're a good person.

1:17:01.666 --> 1:17:04.500
Traveled the world, fought in a war.

1:17:05.083 --> 1:17:07.083
And Gladys, you met Sinatra.

1:17:07.166 --> 1:17:09.500
I heard about your night at the Flamingo.

1:17:09.583 --> 1:17:10.416
[sighs]

1:17:11.333 --> 1:17:16.833
But then the insecurities creep in,
and you start with a slight exaggeration.

1:17:18.041 --> 1:17:20.666
Still you, just a shinier version.

1:17:21.583 --> 1:17:23.458
But… you like it.

1:17:24.666 --> 1:17:26.833
So you tweak it just a little more

1:17:28.375 --> 1:17:32.291
until the real you, which was probably
pretty great to begin with,

1:17:33.291 --> 1:17:35.333
is unrecognizable.

1:17:35.833 --> 1:17:37.333
[somber music playing]

1:17:38.166 --> 1:17:39.250
But here's the thing.

1:17:40.833 --> 1:17:42.500
You're not just fooling yourself.

1:17:43.666 --> 1:17:46.666
There's someone else
on the other side of that lie

1:17:47.416 --> 1:17:51.000
falling in love with a version of you
that doesn't exist.

1:17:52.875 --> 1:17:54.750
And that's not fair

1:17:55.541 --> 1:17:58.833
because the only way it ends for them
is disappointment.

1:17:59.833 --> 1:18:01.458
And the only way it ends for you

1:18:02.916 --> 1:18:03.833
is heartbreak.

1:18:07.875 --> 1:18:09.833
If I've learned anything,

1:18:09.916 --> 1:18:12.791
it's that love doesn't have to be perfect.

1:18:14.375 --> 1:18:15.958
It just has to be honest.

1:18:23.583 --> 1:18:27.625
-Is "curvy" spelled with a Y or an EY?
-[man] There's no E.

1:18:29.500 --> 1:18:32.125
[indistinct chattering]

1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:40.500
I guess I never realized.
I was so busy being mad at you

1:18:40.583 --> 1:18:44.333
that I… I never stopped to think
about why you actually did it.

1:18:44.416 --> 1:18:45.833
Look. Natalie,

1:18:45.916 --> 1:18:48.458
the… the why doesn't even matter anymore.

1:18:48.541 --> 1:18:51.708
It was wrong. I shouldn't have asked you
to lie in the first place.

1:18:51.791 --> 1:18:55.333
And I'm just gonna go to my family
and come clean with everything.

1:18:55.416 --> 1:18:58.083
Wait, what? No.
No, no, no, no. You can't do that.

1:18:58.166 --> 1:19:00.541
Josh, this isn't all your fault. I mean…

1:19:01.958 --> 1:19:04.250
Besides, a deal's a deal.
We've made it this far.

1:19:04.333 --> 1:19:08.291
It's only two days till Christmas.
Let's stage a breakup like we planned.

1:19:08.958 --> 1:19:10.500
Don't worry, I'll sell it.

1:19:11.083 --> 1:19:13.000
I don't know. It… it doesn't feel right.

1:19:14.375 --> 1:19:16.166
Grandma, the car's that way!

1:19:16.791 --> 1:19:18.750
Grandma! That's the wrong way!

1:19:19.250 --> 1:19:20.125
Wait up!

1:19:20.875 --> 1:19:23.083
Grandma, where are you going?

1:19:24.666 --> 1:19:28.416
-[woman whispers] Here they come.
-[all] Surprise!

1:19:30.166 --> 1:19:31.291
[Owen] Hey, guys!

1:19:32.666 --> 1:19:36.916
Oh, we are so excited
to have you join the family!

1:19:37.541 --> 1:19:38.458
[exhales]

1:19:39.166 --> 1:19:43.625
Your parents threw us
a surprise engagement party? Here?

1:19:43.708 --> 1:19:45.750
Yeah. Not ideal.

1:19:47.333 --> 1:19:48.625
[Bob] Let's party!

1:19:51.416 --> 1:19:52.791
-Hi.
-Hey.

1:19:52.875 --> 1:19:54.125
What are you doing here?

1:19:54.208 --> 1:19:57.833
Your aunt asked if we could throw
a surprise engagement party for Josh here.

1:19:57.916 --> 1:19:59.875
-I figured it's the least I could do.
-Oh.

1:19:59.958 --> 1:20:02.041
Where's the bride-to-be anyway?
I haven't met her yet.

1:20:02.125 --> 1:20:03.458
She's doing the rounds.

1:20:03.541 --> 1:20:06.583
-Congratulations, dear.
-Thank you. You look hungry.

1:20:06.666 --> 1:20:08.500
Why did he just congratulate you?

1:20:08.583 --> 1:20:11.500
-Oh. You didn't hear?
-Uh-uh.

1:20:11.583 --> 1:20:14.541
I was the millionth customer
at the Supermart. Hmm.

1:20:14.625 --> 1:20:16.458
-Huh?
-Free non-perishables for life.

1:20:16.541 --> 1:20:17.625
-Wow!
-Yeah, lucky me!

1:20:17.708 --> 1:20:20.291
-I know a great charity that--
-Do you know where the coat check is?

1:20:20.375 --> 1:20:22.666
-Yeah. Oh, okay. Uh-huh.
-Do you mind taking that for me?

1:20:22.750 --> 1:20:24.958
-Thank you so much.
-You… you look great, by the way.

1:20:25.041 --> 1:20:27.250
Thanks. [sighs]

1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:30.208
Hors d'oeuvres?

1:20:30.291 --> 1:20:32.750
[Eric] J-Dog! Congrats, my man!

1:20:32.833 --> 1:20:37.000
E-Rock! My mom really did invite
everybody in town. Huh?

1:20:37.083 --> 1:20:41.125
Well, actually, I was just dropping off
your, uh, your lady's suitcase.

1:20:41.208 --> 1:20:44.250
There's so much nice underwear in there.
You're a lucky guy.

1:20:46.541 --> 1:20:48.666
I gotta say I'm surprised. [clears throat]

1:20:48.750 --> 1:20:49.791
Lee?

1:20:49.875 --> 1:20:53.625
-I didn't think it was gonna work out.
-How… how… are you here?

1:20:53.708 --> 1:20:56.208
Duh, first class, honey.
I'm not a peasant.

1:20:56.291 --> 1:20:57.500
No, I… I mean, um--

1:20:57.583 --> 1:21:00.416
Listen, you're not the only one
that can stalk people on the internet.

1:21:00.500 --> 1:21:05.000
I found out about this little soirée
courtesy of Barb's Facebook page. Hello!

1:21:05.083 --> 1:21:07.500
[breathing heavily]

1:21:08.958 --> 1:21:10.583
Hey, how's it going?

1:21:11.333 --> 1:21:13.208
So, Tag and Lee are here.

1:21:13.291 --> 1:21:16.458
-Lee? Are you dating two guys now?
-No, he's my boss.

1:21:16.541 --> 1:21:18.250
What? Why is he here?

1:21:18.333 --> 1:21:19.583
Because God hates me.

1:21:21.583 --> 1:21:23.083
Glenlivet 12, neat.

1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:25.666
That's a man who knows how to drink.

1:21:26.250 --> 1:21:29.791
Just act natural. We'll figure a way out.
We just got to stick together. Okay?

1:21:29.875 --> 1:21:32.750
Hey, babe.
I want to introduce you to my parents.

1:21:32.833 --> 1:21:33.833
I'm out.

1:21:33.916 --> 1:21:35.458
What brings you here?

1:21:35.541 --> 1:21:36.875
I'm Natalie's boss.

1:21:38.375 --> 1:21:39.666
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

1:21:40.291 --> 1:21:41.166
Tell me more.

1:21:41.250 --> 1:21:43.416
Mom, Dad, this is Natalie.

1:21:43.500 --> 1:21:44.416
-Hello.
-Hi.

1:21:44.500 --> 1:21:46.208
-Hi.
-Tag's told us so much about you.

1:21:46.291 --> 1:21:48.666
He never says anything
about his girlfriends, so…

1:21:48.750 --> 1:21:49.833
Dad, come on.

1:21:49.916 --> 1:21:52.958
Girlfriend. Wow.
It's… it's so, so nice to meet you.

1:21:53.041 --> 1:21:56.166
[breathlessly] I think I'm just gonna
go use the ladies' room.

1:21:57.458 --> 1:21:59.291
Hey, not so fast. We need to talk.

1:21:59.375 --> 1:22:02.333
-I'm kind of busy, Owen.
-Oh, talking to your lover, Tag?

1:22:02.416 --> 1:22:06.416
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I saw you two
here last night looking pretty damn cozy.

1:22:06.500 --> 1:22:08.875
Okay, it's not… it's not what you think.

1:22:08.958 --> 1:22:11.708
Ah, that's funny,
because I didn't know what to think

1:22:11.791 --> 1:22:14.083
until I spoke to your boss
a few seconds ago,

1:22:14.166 --> 1:22:15.916
and now it all makes sense.

1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:17.458
Okay, look, I… I can explain.

1:22:17.541 --> 1:22:19.041
-So the thing is--
-La-la-la-la…

1:22:19.125 --> 1:22:23.166
I don't want to hear it. I just want you
to stop this charade with my brother.

1:22:25.750 --> 1:22:27.333
Two glasses of Veuve, please.

1:22:27.416 --> 1:22:29.916
-Tag, [burps] what's going on, bro?
-What's up, E?

1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:32.291
Can you believe
that J-Dog is getting married?

1:22:32.375 --> 1:22:34.666
-Chick's pretty cool too.
-I haven't met her yet.

1:22:34.750 --> 1:22:35.958
Well, she's right there.

1:22:36.458 --> 1:22:37.833
Dude, that's his cousin.

1:22:37.916 --> 1:22:41.541
I don't judge. You love who you love.

1:22:41.625 --> 1:22:42.500
No. You know wh--

1:22:42.583 --> 1:22:44.541
Why should I believe
what comes out of your mouth?

1:22:44.625 --> 1:22:46.916
-Are you serious--
-Hey! Everything okay here?

1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:48.041
-No!
-Yes.

1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:53.083
Natalie, she didn't come to New York
for love. She came here for a story.

1:22:53.166 --> 1:22:55.083
She's been playing you since day one, bro.

1:22:55.166 --> 1:22:58.666
She's a writer for a Disaster Date column,
and you're not her fiancé.

1:22:58.750 --> 1:23:00.166
You are her subject.

1:23:00.250 --> 1:23:02.375
-Don't--
-Wait. What? Nat.

1:23:02.458 --> 1:23:03.625
What is he talking about?

1:23:05.833 --> 1:23:07.666
[Bob] Could I have everyone's attention?

1:23:07.750 --> 1:23:09.000
[sighs]

1:23:09.791 --> 1:23:12.458
I'm not one for speeches,
so I'll keep this quick.

1:23:13.083 --> 1:23:13.916
Uh…

1:23:14.416 --> 1:23:15.458
Josh.

1:23:16.250 --> 1:23:19.666
I know we haven't always seen
eye-to-eye on things,

1:23:19.750 --> 1:23:22.333
but you're a good kid with a big heart,

1:23:22.416 --> 1:23:27.708
and after spending, uh, the last week
with your beautiful bride-to-be,

1:23:28.500 --> 1:23:31.958
I think the whole family agrees
that you've picked a winner!

1:23:32.041 --> 1:23:34.083
I couldn't be happier for you, son.

1:23:34.166 --> 1:23:37.958
So let's all raise a glass
to future Mr. and Mrs. Lin,

1:23:38.041 --> 1:23:39.833
-Josh and--
-No!

1:23:43.541 --> 1:23:45.000
Not yet. Um…

1:23:45.083 --> 1:23:46.208
Uh…

1:23:46.833 --> 1:23:50.250
[Natalie] We can't cheers
before all the speeches are done.

1:23:50.333 --> 1:23:55.958
I mean, I'd like to add
to your beautiful, beautiful speech

1:23:56.041 --> 1:23:59.166
with my own speech.

1:23:59.750 --> 1:24:01.250
A speech sequel, per se,

1:24:02.833 --> 1:24:06.166

1:24:06.250 --> 1:24:07.166

1:24:15.125 --> 1:24:16.375

1:24:17.958 --> 1:24:19.458
Because that's what I've been,

1:24:20.416 --> 1:24:21.333

1:24:22.458 --> 1:24:25.041

1:24:25.708 --> 1:24:26.875

1:24:26.958 --> 1:24:28.125
everyone, really. I--

1:24:29.083 --> 1:24:29.916
[Natalie sighs]

1:24:31.666 --> 1:24:32.875
[whispers] Here it goes.

1:24:33.375 --> 1:24:35.916
[inhales] Four weeks ago,
I met a guy online.

1:24:36.833 --> 1:24:40.916
He was smart, funny, sweet,
and he looked like him.

1:24:42.416 --> 1:24:45.458
So, I decided to come here
and surprise him for Christmas.

1:24:46.875 --> 1:24:48.958
But when I got here,
I realized that the guy

1:24:49.041 --> 1:24:51.708
I was really talking to was him.

1:24:53.416 --> 1:24:54.541
I got catfished,

1:24:55.291 --> 1:24:56.458
and I was furious.

1:24:57.875 --> 1:25:01.208
But Josh told me
that he would help get me Tag

1:25:01.291 --> 1:25:04.166
if I pretended to be his girlfriend
for the holidays.

1:25:04.250 --> 1:25:05.458
And I honestly just--

1:25:05.541 --> 1:25:08.625
I… I thought
that my perfect match was here,

1:25:08.708 --> 1:25:11.916
so I agreed, and I pretended
to be someone that I'm not, but…

1:25:12.750 --> 1:25:15.083
[exhales] I just wanted my happy ending.

1:25:16.875 --> 1:25:17.750
[scoffs]

1:25:18.250 --> 1:25:21.083
[Natalie] But I can't do it anymore.
I… I… I can't lie.

1:25:21.166 --> 1:25:22.916
I just can't, I'm sorry. I…

1:25:25.166 --> 1:25:26.583
I'm so sorry.

1:25:31.125 --> 1:25:32.416

1:25:34.750 --> 1:25:35.708

1:25:36.708 --> 1:25:37.750

1:25:40.041 --> 1:25:42.416
I literally had to get stoned
to get through it.

1:25:42.500 --> 1:25:45.333
[chuckles] Yeah. Now, that's my girl.

1:25:46.333 --> 1:25:51.083
[Tag] Okay, so… so you got mad at Josh
for catfishing you,

1:25:51.166 --> 1:25:53.625
and then you go
and do the exact same thing to me.

1:25:54.208 --> 1:25:55.958

1:25:59.791 --> 1:26:01.000

Nothing to see here, all right?

1:26:20.541 --> 1:26:21.625
Okay? All right?

1:26:23.166 --> 1:26:25.875
All right. Time to go home.
Stop looking at my brother.
