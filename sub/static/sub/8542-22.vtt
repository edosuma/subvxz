[instrumental music]

00:07.616 --> 00:09.531
[indistinct chattering]

00:12.273 --> 00:14.840
What brings us to
this beautiful place, Lisbon?

00:14.927 --> 00:16.625
A missing person.

00:16.712 --> 00:19.758
Jay Banner. He's 26 years old.
He's a local boy.

00:19.845 --> 00:22.587
He works at some sort
of marine salvage place.

00:22.674 --> 00:25.721
He went surfing yesterday,
and he never came home.

00:25.808 --> 00:28.724
Oh, look at the crabs.
You see the little crab?

00:30.900 --> 00:32.249
Oh, look at the little crabby.

00:34.338 --> 00:36.949
Excuse me.
I'm Agent Lisbon with the CBI.

00:37.037 --> 00:40.214
This is Consultant Patrick Jane.

00:40.301 --> 00:43.826
- Are you, uh, Chief Anson?
- That's right.

00:43.913 --> 00:47.134
These are Jay's roommates,
Tark Mitchum, Vicki Lang.

00:47.221 --> 00:48.352
Welcome.

00:48.439 --> 00:50.833
Oh, come on.
We're not welcome.

00:50.920 --> 00:53.488
You resent us being here
on your turf.

00:53.575 --> 00:55.838
Let me rephrase that,
your, uh..

00:55.925 --> 00:58.493
...your sand,
your sandy coastline.

00:58.580 --> 01:00.234
Not at all.

01:00.321 --> 01:04.020
It's just that Jay's an adult.
Barely been gone a day.

01:04.107 --> 01:08.024
This just seems to me to be
a complete waste of time.

01:08.111 --> 01:09.678
Is this where
he was last seen?

01:09.765 --> 01:12.550
Yeah, him and Jeeter.
That's our other roommate.

01:12.637 --> 01:14.770
They went out yesterday
for dawn patrol.

01:14.857 --> 01:16.337
That's an early morning
surf session.

01:16.424 --> 01:17.686
I know.

01:17.773 --> 01:19.514
And Jay didn't come home
all night.

01:19.601 --> 01:22.908
I found his board right here,
which means he didn't drown.

01:22.995 --> 01:24.954
I mean, he wouldn't drown.
He was a fish.

01:25.041 --> 01:26.564
So I thought,
what if he's been kidnapped?

01:26.651 --> 01:28.305
So, I called the cops.

01:28.392 --> 01:30.655
You called your father.
The congressman?

01:30.742 --> 01:32.918
I wanted the big guns, chief.

01:33.005 --> 01:34.572
That board's a custom.

01:34.659 --> 01:35.921
So either Jay was very rich

01:36.008 --> 01:37.793
or very serious
about his surfing.

01:37.880 --> 01:39.403
He's serious, dude.
He's trying to go pro.

01:39.490 --> 01:42.102
All he needs is that
one big endorsement.

01:42.189 --> 01:43.712
Okay. Well, don't mind me.

01:43.799 --> 01:47.281
I'm gonna take a little stroll,
soak up the atmosphere.

01:47.368 --> 01:49.631
'Oh! So gorgeous.'

01:49.718 --> 01:52.547
Did he have any troubles?
Drug problems?

01:52.634 --> 01:54.549
Bad relationships?

01:54.636 --> 01:56.116
No, I mean..

01:58.074 --> 01:59.858
No.

01:59.945 --> 02:01.295
- Shut up, Tark.
- Wh..

02:03.732 --> 02:06.909
Um, me and Jay used to hook up,
not for a long time.

02:06.996 --> 02:08.302
When did you break up?

02:08.389 --> 02:10.086
We weren't dating.
It was casual.

02:10.173 --> 02:11.870
- That's how Jay wanted it.
- 'Oh!'

02:15.613 --> 02:16.788
What is he doing?

02:18.529 --> 02:20.270
Big gun, huh?

02:20.357 --> 02:21.532
Lisbon!

02:25.275 --> 02:26.407
Flies and crabs!

02:27.669 --> 02:29.105
Excuse me?

02:29.192 --> 02:31.455
Crabs are scavengers,
so I followed one.

02:31.542 --> 02:34.154
Led me to this swarm of flies,
and look.

02:35.546 --> 02:36.504
[flies buzzing]

02:36.591 --> 02:37.853
'I found Jay Banner.'

02:41.596 --> 02:43.293
[flies buzzing]

02:48.124 --> 02:49.865
[Lisbon]
The victim worked
for this outfit here.

02:49.952 --> 02:51.171
Santa Marta Salvage.

02:52.955 --> 02:53.999
Excuse me?

02:56.480 --> 02:59.396
Excuse me, ma'am. Hi.
Are you Greta Marshall?

02:59.483 --> 03:01.050
Uh, yeah. Sure am.

03:01.137 --> 03:02.834
I'm Agent Lisbon
with the CBI.

03:02.921 --> 03:04.488
We just wanted to ask you
a few questions

03:04.575 --> 03:06.447
about your employee,
Jay Banner.

03:06.534 --> 03:08.536
Jay.

03:08.623 --> 03:11.016
Oh, that was such
a terrible thing, awful.

03:11.103 --> 03:12.844
News travels fast, huh?

03:12.931 --> 03:14.237
Small town, big ears.

03:16.283 --> 03:19.895
You should talk to my husband
too. Um, we co-own the company.

03:19.982 --> 03:21.375
Hey, Greg! Honey!

03:24.900 --> 03:26.380
What are you doing?

03:26.467 --> 03:27.946
I'm just checking
the nav equipment.

03:28.033 --> 03:30.601
Oh, checking the nav equipment.

03:30.688 --> 03:32.386
We had a big storm
come in here last month.

03:32.473 --> 03:34.170
Stirred everything up.

03:34.257 --> 03:36.520
She hit an uncharted sandbar
and, well..

03:36.607 --> 03:38.435
...knocked the sonar around.

03:38.522 --> 03:39.480
Ouch!

03:40.829 --> 03:41.917
Hey, what's up?

03:43.223 --> 03:44.789
Greg?

03:44.876 --> 03:47.139
Oh, my God.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.445
'What are you doing here?'

03:48.532 --> 03:50.360
You live here?
In California?

03:50.447 --> 03:52.319
Yeah, 14 years now.

03:52.406 --> 03:54.625
Uh, Greta's from Santa Marta.

03:54.712 --> 03:56.758
My-my wife, I, um..

03:56.845 --> 03:59.761
Honey, this is,
uh, Teresa Lisbon.

04:01.719 --> 04:03.068
This is Teresa Lisbon?

04:04.505 --> 04:05.854
TheTeresa Lisbon?

04:08.770 --> 04:09.684
The one and only.

04:11.816 --> 04:16.473
Uh, Greg and I used to date when
we were kids back in Chicago.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.214
Yeah, we were engaged,
in fact.

04:20.521 --> 04:23.872
Okay. Uh, let me guess.
You broke it off?

04:26.962 --> 04:29.704
I was way too young.

04:29.791 --> 04:31.488
Yeah, well, of course.
Did she break your heart?

04:31.575 --> 04:32.837
[chuckles]
I wouldn't say that.

04:32.924 --> 04:35.536
- No.
- Yeah, you did.

04:35.623 --> 04:38.147
'Cause he was still talking
about you when we met.

04:38.234 --> 04:40.280
[laughs]
Heartbreaker.

04:43.500 --> 04:46.155
We just w-wanted to ask you
some questions about Jay.

04:46.242 --> 04:47.896
Is there somewhere
more private we can talk?

04:47.983 --> 04:49.680
Sure, yeah,
we got offices up there.

04:52.553 --> 04:54.381
Do you have any tea?
'Cause this could take a while.

04:54.468 --> 04:55.599
Mm-hmm.

05:00.343 --> 05:02.737
[theme music]

05:12.573 --> 05:14.052
[Lisbon]
'How long did Jay work here?'

05:14.139 --> 05:16.011
Well, about a year.

05:16.098 --> 05:18.448
Until last week.
He-he quit.

05:18.535 --> 05:20.537
[Lisbon]
'Oh!'

05:20.624 --> 05:23.497
[Greg]
'Yeah, lately he had
something on his mind.'

05:23.584 --> 05:25.629
I mean, he was only doing this
for side money, anyways

05:25.716 --> 05:27.022
while he did his surf thing.

05:27.109 --> 05:28.197
Mom.

05:28.284 --> 05:29.938
[Greg]
Hey, baby.

05:30.025 --> 05:31.722
I need money for the movie.

05:31.809 --> 05:33.898
Excuse me?

05:33.985 --> 05:36.510
May I please have money
for the movie?

05:36.597 --> 05:38.468
- And popcorn.
- Here.

05:38.555 --> 05:42.559
Hi. I'm Patrick Jane.
That's, uh, the Teresa Lisbon.

05:42.646 --> 05:44.344
Hi. I'm Lauren Tayback.

05:44.431 --> 05:46.607
Hi, Lauren.

05:46.694 --> 05:48.260
Okay, go.
Have fun, babe. Bye.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.566
- Okay.
- Bye.

05:49.653 --> 05:51.394
Nice to meet you,
Lauren Tayback.

05:51.481 --> 05:52.743
Wow. How many do you have?

05:52.830 --> 05:55.093
Uh, we got Lauren,
Maddy, and Sally.

05:55.180 --> 05:57.444
[whistles]
Wow.

05:57.531 --> 05:58.706
Breeder.

06:01.099 --> 06:03.493
Yeah.

06:03.580 --> 06:05.974
Uh, you didn't, uh,
like Jay much, did you?

06:06.061 --> 06:08.672
What? No, he was
a great diver, man.

06:08.759 --> 06:10.282
Yes, but you didn't
like him. Why?

06:11.936 --> 06:14.591
It's...I have three daughters,
alright?

06:14.678 --> 06:16.158
And I wouldn't want any of them

06:16.245 --> 06:17.681
being treated the way
Jay treated women.

06:17.768 --> 06:18.813
How is that?

06:20.205 --> 06:21.293
Use 'em and toss 'em.

06:23.034 --> 06:24.645
Uh, why did Jay quit?

06:24.732 --> 06:27.648
[chuckles]
Oh, why do people quit?

06:27.735 --> 06:29.301
Hmm.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.694
You know,
they just quit.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.829
- Excuse me.
- See you, babe.

06:38.441 --> 06:40.269
She's nice.

06:40.356 --> 06:42.227
[Van Pelt]
Uh, Rigsby's
taking a personal day.

06:42.314 --> 06:43.968
The baby's sick,
and Sarah has court.

06:46.144 --> 06:47.711
He's really embracing
the daddy thing.

06:47.798 --> 06:48.799
Yeah.

06:50.279 --> 06:51.672
[knocking on door]

06:57.242 --> 06:58.679
You guys the cops?

06:58.766 --> 07:00.420
Yeah.

07:00.507 --> 07:03.553
CBI. Are you Jay Banner's
other roommate?

07:03.640 --> 07:07.035
No. Uh, I'm the landlord.
Lance Gladstone.

07:07.122 --> 07:09.037
I, uh, own this place.

07:09.124 --> 07:11.866
I live in the, uh, back house.

07:11.953 --> 07:14.695
I was just gonna do
some work on these steps.

07:14.782 --> 07:16.784
Keep my mind off Jay,
you know?

07:16.871 --> 07:18.960
You have keys to let us in?

07:19.047 --> 07:20.309
Sure.

07:20.396 --> 07:21.876
[keys jangling]

07:28.578 --> 07:29.797
What?

07:32.277 --> 07:34.671
[Van Pelt]
'Jeeter, how long
were you and Jay roommates?'

07:34.758 --> 07:37.326
Three years. Jay and me.

07:39.241 --> 07:42.070
We were both trying
to qualify for the pro tour.

07:42.157 --> 07:44.159
And Jay was really close
to inking a deal

07:44.246 --> 07:45.900
with Oakley, you know?

07:45.987 --> 07:47.902
Mind if I open a window?

07:47.989 --> 07:50.426
Please. This smoke
plays hell with my asthma.

07:50.513 --> 07:52.863
I have a prescription.

07:52.950 --> 07:54.952
I have anxiety.

07:55.039 --> 07:56.867
Especially now.

07:56.954 --> 07:59.740
Jay was my best friend.

07:59.827 --> 08:02.003
And you two went surfing
together yesterday morning?

08:02.090 --> 08:04.527
For a while, and then
it got kind of blown out.

08:05.963 --> 08:07.443
So I went to work.

08:07.530 --> 08:08.749
I left at 7:00.

08:08.836 --> 08:10.315
Jay was alive
when you left?

08:10.402 --> 08:12.927
Yes. God, yes.

08:13.014 --> 08:16.583
He was standing there
on the beach.

08:16.670 --> 08:19.847
Coroner's preliminary report
says Jay died yesterday morning

08:19.934 --> 08:21.544
around the time
you were with him.

08:21.631 --> 08:23.241
Did you see anything unusual?

08:23.328 --> 08:24.765
Maybe someone else on the beach?

08:24.852 --> 08:26.593
No. No one on the beach.

08:28.551 --> 08:31.075
But there was a boat coming in.

08:31.162 --> 08:32.686
Coming in?
That's weird for that hour.

08:32.773 --> 08:33.904
Most boats are going out.

08:33.991 --> 08:37.081
- You see the name of the boat?
- No.

08:37.168 --> 08:39.040
Couldn't see
with the marine layer.

08:39.127 --> 08:41.433
Running lights weren't on.

08:41.521 --> 08:42.739
Interesting.

08:42.826 --> 08:44.611
Somebody didn't want to be seen.

08:44.698 --> 08:48.179
Marine salvage.
What is that, exactly?

08:48.266 --> 08:51.095
We do lots of different stuff,
like water rescue

08:51.182 --> 08:53.794
harbor clean-up,
wreck diving ops.

08:53.881 --> 08:55.883
Wreck diving ops? That sounds
like treasure hunting.

08:55.970 --> 08:57.711
[chuckles]
No, not so much.

08:57.798 --> 08:59.887
We got a lot of old ships
on the ocean floor around here.

08:59.974 --> 09:01.802
'That's pictures of some of them
on the wall there.'

09:01.889 --> 09:03.804
But they've all been
picked over for decades now.

09:03.891 --> 09:05.545
There's nothing down there
but some..

09:05.632 --> 09:06.807
...cool wrecks
to dive around.

09:06.894 --> 09:08.243
Uh, the Brother Jonathan

09:08.330 --> 09:10.375
uh, the Golden State,
and the Fremont..

09:10.462 --> 09:12.464
Those wreck diving ops,
can you do those alone?

09:12.552 --> 09:14.379
No, not if you wanna
live long.

09:14.466 --> 09:17.295
One guy handles the winch,
the other one dives, always.

09:17.382 --> 09:18.993
- Hmm.
- Why?

09:19.080 --> 09:21.256
Lisbon, we should get going.
Uh, Greg.

09:21.343 --> 09:22.866
Real pleasure to meet you.

09:22.953 --> 09:25.260
Thank you very much
for the tea. Take care.

09:27.828 --> 09:29.177
Greg..

09:30.874 --> 09:32.572
...thank you for your time.

09:43.321 --> 09:44.975
Jeeter's really torn up.

09:45.062 --> 09:46.455
So he and Jay got along?

09:46.542 --> 09:49.371
No...jealousy,
arguments over girls?

09:49.458 --> 09:51.068
Best buds.

09:51.155 --> 09:52.809
Jeeter's a good guy.

09:52.896 --> 09:55.072
I'm gonna prorate the rent
till they find another roommate.

09:55.159 --> 09:58.119
- Was Jay the big earner?
- No way.

09:58.206 --> 10:00.861
'I mean, all these guys
are living hand to mouth.'

10:00.948 --> 10:02.689
Jay could hardly buy food.

10:02.776 --> 10:05.648
He was talking about moving out
and living on his boat.

10:05.735 --> 10:07.345
What boat?

10:07.432 --> 10:10.044
Some cheap, old powerboat.

10:10.131 --> 10:11.915
'Jay had a berth somewhere.'

10:12.002 --> 10:14.396
[dramatic music]

10:17.617 --> 10:18.966
Oh, here you go, man.

10:19.053 --> 10:20.184
Thanks.

10:23.405 --> 10:25.799
[music continues]

10:35.722 --> 10:37.985
Coke.

10:38.072 --> 10:39.943
Looks like enough
to sell.

10:40.030 --> 10:41.684
Aw, dude,
that's seriously uncool.

10:41.771 --> 10:45.383
It's a lightning bolt. I've seen
this before in Sacramento.

10:45.470 --> 10:47.429
Jay was in the city last week.

10:47.516 --> 10:49.126
Said he had business.

10:49.213 --> 10:51.302
No sign of a murder weapon
on the beach.

10:51.389 --> 10:52.826
Coroner thinks
it was something heavy.

10:52.913 --> 10:55.263
Possibly metal.

10:55.350 --> 10:58.440
Hey, chief. Any sign
of the victim's powerboat?

10:58.527 --> 11:00.834
Not yet.
It's not at the docks.

11:00.921 --> 11:03.053
Jay lost his berth
for non-payment of rent.

11:03.140 --> 11:05.403
Might have it trailered
somewhere on land.

11:05.490 --> 11:07.405
We're happy to give you
some extra people to search.

11:07.492 --> 11:11.801
If that boat is in Santa Marta,
I'll find it.

11:11.888 --> 11:14.151
No help from CBI is necessary,
but you know what?

11:15.500 --> 11:16.806
Thank you very much.

11:20.375 --> 11:21.811
[female #1]
'Hello?'

11:21.898 --> 11:23.770
Isn't there a coke dealer
in Sacramento..

11:23.857 --> 11:25.597
...uses a lightning bolt
as a logo?

11:25.685 --> 11:27.512
[female #1]
'Well, hello to you, too.'

11:27.599 --> 11:29.514
'Lightning bolt..'

11:29.601 --> 11:31.342
Tookie Burroughs used
to use a lightning bolt.

11:31.429 --> 11:32.953
Maybe he still does.

11:33.040 --> 11:34.345
The victim
had dealer-quantity coke

11:34.432 --> 11:35.999
with that logo on every bag.

11:36.086 --> 11:38.001
Oh, well, you know,
I know Tookie from way back.

11:38.088 --> 11:39.568
- If you want, I could--
- 'No, no.'

11:39.655 --> 11:41.309
Don't even think about it.
I just need a name.

11:41.396 --> 11:42.440
And I'll take it from there.

11:42.527 --> 11:44.312
You're no fun at all.

11:44.399 --> 11:46.706
Our victim was a semi-pro
surfer, name of Jay Banner.

11:46.793 --> 11:48.055
You can ask around about him.

11:48.142 --> 11:49.491
See if he was
a real player or not.

11:49.578 --> 11:51.928
Jay Banner. Okay.

11:52.015 --> 11:53.538
I love you, boo.
Come home soon.

11:54.801 --> 11:55.889
[Cho]
Bye, babe.

12:08.162 --> 12:09.946
Was that Summer?

12:10.033 --> 12:12.470
Yeah.

12:12.557 --> 12:15.517
Sorry to be direct, but what's
going on with you and her?

12:15.604 --> 12:17.649
[sighs]
She's my confidential informant.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.913
Right..

12:20.000 --> 12:22.219
...but we're not allowed
to date CIs.

12:24.178 --> 12:25.745
You're givingme
dating advice?

12:30.271 --> 12:33.883
As a friend,
even if she weren't your CI..

12:33.970 --> 12:35.189
...are you sure
she's someone you should..

12:36.930 --> 12:38.105
...be around?

12:41.717 --> 12:42.762
Let's go.

12:44.024 --> 12:45.416
[engine starts]

12:47.027 --> 12:48.898
[Jane]
'Well, Greg seems very nice.'

12:48.985 --> 12:50.770
I am not discussing it
with you.

12:50.857 --> 12:54.861
Nice, solid, dependable.
I can see why you dumped him.

12:54.948 --> 12:56.645
- I mean it, Jane.
- Alright.

12:56.732 --> 12:57.864
- Seriously.
- Alright.

13:02.390 --> 13:05.828
I didn't dump him.
We both decided to take a break.

13:05.915 --> 13:07.699
Mm-hmm.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.136
The old, let's take a break.

13:10.354 --> 13:11.529
[Lisbon]
I did not dump him.

13:13.401 --> 13:14.576
[Tookie]
'Sixty bucks.'

13:14.663 --> 13:16.752
Sixty? Come on, Tookie.

13:16.839 --> 13:19.102
What do you say 40
for old time's sake?

13:19.189 --> 13:21.844
Sure, after you do me
for old time's sake.

13:21.931 --> 13:23.672
[chuckles]

13:23.759 --> 13:26.196
Is this the same stuff you sell
to my boy, Jay from Santa Marta?

13:27.458 --> 13:29.286
'Cause that-that was good.

13:31.027 --> 13:32.333
- Jay?
- Mmm.

13:34.944 --> 13:35.902
Jay Banner.

13:35.989 --> 13:37.251
[cell phone ringing]

13:37.338 --> 13:38.730
- Oh, yeah. The surf punk.
- Mm-hmm.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.950
I like that dude.
He's hardcore.

13:41.037 --> 13:42.082
Hang on a second.

13:43.344 --> 13:44.780
- Ahem.
- Yeah? So speak.

13:46.129 --> 13:47.696
Oh!

13:47.783 --> 13:49.611
'Yeah, y-you tell him
I told him to shove it down'

13:49.698 --> 13:51.831
'his mother's throat,
the little punk bitch.'

13:54.877 --> 13:56.923
Moron.

13:57.010 --> 13:59.795
So I heard Jay was, uh,
in some beef with some people.

14:01.188 --> 14:02.972
- Oh, yeah? I never heard that.
- No?

14:11.502 --> 14:12.852
It's good stuff.

14:15.028 --> 14:16.203
See you around, Tookie.

14:17.291 --> 14:18.466
Yeah, see you, babes.

14:31.348 --> 14:32.349
Summer, you here?

14:33.916 --> 14:35.483
[water running]

14:43.839 --> 14:44.884
I got Indian.

14:46.668 --> 14:48.626
[Summer]
'Hi, baby, um..'

14:48.713 --> 14:51.368
Hey, I'm gonna hang
with my girlfriends tonight.

14:51.455 --> 14:53.109
'Do you mind? Rain check?'

14:56.852 --> 14:58.593
You come out
and talk to me, okay?

14:58.680 --> 15:00.421
[chuckles]
'Babe, I'm in the shower.'

15:01.770 --> 15:04.033
Something's wrong.

15:04.120 --> 15:06.470
Come on out.
I mean it. Right now.

15:06.557 --> 15:10.126
'Kimball, this is my house,
not yours.'

15:10.213 --> 15:11.998
'I'll come out
when I feel like it.'

15:12.085 --> 15:14.826
- Step away from the door.
- 'No.'

15:14.914 --> 15:16.263
'Kimball, don't.'

15:16.350 --> 15:17.394
Ah!

15:22.965 --> 15:23.966
You never listen.

15:33.323 --> 15:35.238
It was just a mugging.
It's no big deal.

15:36.761 --> 15:38.111
Where?

15:38.198 --> 15:39.764
Downtown.

15:39.851 --> 15:43.072
Some punk kid.
It's just bruises. I'm fine.

15:45.161 --> 15:46.597
- Ow!
- Sorry.

15:50.688 --> 15:51.733
[sighing]

15:51.820 --> 15:53.561
If it was just a mugging..

15:53.648 --> 15:55.041
...why would you not
want me to see you?

15:56.781 --> 15:58.131
Hmm?

15:58.218 --> 15:59.349
Summer, look at me.

16:00.568 --> 16:01.612
Tell me the truth.

16:03.136 --> 16:04.354
Did you go see that dealer?

16:05.790 --> 16:07.792
No.

16:07.879 --> 16:09.098
You went to see
Tookie Burroughs.

16:09.185 --> 16:10.752
You asked him
about Jay Banner.

16:10.839 --> 16:12.493
No, I swear I didn't.

16:18.368 --> 16:19.413
Okay, fine.

16:21.154 --> 16:23.243
It wasn't a mugging.

16:23.330 --> 16:24.722
But..

16:24.809 --> 16:28.422
I ran into some guy
I used to party with and..

16:28.509 --> 16:30.990
...he got mad when I told him I
didn't want to do that anymore.

16:31.077 --> 16:32.600
Happens all the time,
alright?

16:32.687 --> 16:35.516
Can we please
just forget about it?

16:35.603 --> 16:37.083
What was his name?

16:37.170 --> 16:38.258
This guy you used to know.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.742
I don't know his name?
I-I don't, I don't know what..

16:44.829 --> 16:47.267
I remember Bob or..

16:47.354 --> 16:49.182
...Steve.

16:49.269 --> 16:51.488
I don't know, Kimball.
Please.

16:51.575 --> 16:53.925
Can we just forget
about it, please?

16:56.885 --> 16:58.017
Get some rest.

17:06.938 --> 17:08.592
- Morning, boss.
- Morning. How's Ben?

17:08.679 --> 17:11.508
Oh, yeah, he's better, thanks.
It's some kind of ear infection.

17:11.595 --> 17:13.249
Easy to knock out
with antibiotics.

17:13.336 --> 17:15.773
Gave him a fever and made him,
you know, throw up.

17:15.860 --> 17:17.906
- A lot of throw up.
- Aw, poor thing.

17:17.993 --> 17:20.169
Did we have any luck
finding The Hang Ten?

17:20.256 --> 17:21.344
The victim's powerboat?

17:21.431 --> 17:23.085
Oh! No.

17:23.172 --> 17:25.783
Chief Anson asked all over
Santa Marta. Nothing yet.

17:25.870 --> 17:28.177
Uh, what about the mystery
vessel the roommate saw

17:28.264 --> 17:30.223
coming in? We need to talk
to whoever was on that boat.

17:30.310 --> 17:32.964
Yeah, we talked to every
boater in town. Sorry.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.444
Uh, Rigs, you got something
on your..

17:36.098 --> 17:38.361
- Is that spit-up?
- Mmm. Yeah.

17:38.448 --> 17:39.928
It's from this morning.

17:40.015 --> 17:41.147
I was feeding him,
and he was looking up at me

17:41.234 --> 17:43.497
with those big,
adorable eyes.

17:43.584 --> 17:44.672
And then he barfed.

17:44.759 --> 17:46.108
- Kids, huh?
- Yeah.

17:47.675 --> 17:49.720
You know what?

17:49.807 --> 17:52.071
He's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

17:52.158 --> 17:53.768
Wow. That's great.

18:09.653 --> 18:12.352
Morning, chief.
Trapping those tourists early?

18:12.439 --> 18:15.398
Permit-only spot.
Clearly posted.

18:15.485 --> 18:17.487
They can get it out of impound
if they have $200.

18:17.574 --> 18:18.880
'That's the law.'

18:18.967 --> 18:21.361
There's no tyranny
like petty tyranny.

18:21.448 --> 18:24.190
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

18:24.277 --> 18:25.365
Where you going?

18:25.452 --> 18:26.409
Research library.

18:27.976 --> 18:29.499
That's the bar.

18:29.586 --> 18:30.674
[blows raspberry]

18:33.982 --> 18:35.810
I'm going to meet Jane
in Santa Marta.

18:35.897 --> 18:37.159
Has Cho been in yet?

18:37.246 --> 18:38.856
- I haven't seen him.
- Alright.

18:38.943 --> 18:40.858
Oh, hey, I interviewed
some of Jay's surfing buddies

18:40.945 --> 18:42.295
and we've got a lead, maybe.

18:42.382 --> 18:44.558
- Yeah?
- Possible angry girlfriend.

18:44.645 --> 18:46.386
Day before the murder,
these guys on the beach

18:46.473 --> 18:49.606
saw Jay getting yelled at
on his cell phone by some woman.

18:49.693 --> 18:50.912
Apparently,
it was pretty heated.

18:50.999 --> 18:53.610
Why didn't the roommates
tell us about her?

18:53.697 --> 18:55.177
Maybe they didn't know.

18:55.264 --> 18:57.223
Oh, and bad news
about our drug dealer.

18:57.310 --> 18:59.790
The guy Banner
was getting the coke from?

18:59.877 --> 19:01.662
'Cho got the name.'

19:01.749 --> 19:04.621
Carlton Tookie Burroughs,
but he's got an alibi.

19:04.708 --> 19:06.580
Sac PD arrested him
the night before the murder

19:06.667 --> 19:08.277
and didn't kick him
until noon the next day.

19:08.364 --> 19:09.844
Hours after Banner died.

19:09.931 --> 19:11.889
Alright, strike Burroughs
from the list.

19:11.976 --> 19:13.804
And if anything with
the girlfriend pops, call me.

19:13.891 --> 19:14.892
Alright.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.113
Hey.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.246
Wayne, you've got
something on your..

19:20.333 --> 19:22.030
Oh, yeah. It's just vomit.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.164
Okay.

19:42.833 --> 19:45.836
Uh, Vicki, another round
for my friends here.

19:45.923 --> 19:46.837
You got it, Mr. Jane.

19:46.924 --> 19:48.230
- Jane--
- Shh.

19:48.317 --> 19:49.710
We're getting
at the best part here.

19:49.797 --> 19:51.407
Fierce storm,
low visibility.

19:51.494 --> 19:54.149
A rock has just torn a hole
in the Fremont's hull

19:54.236 --> 19:56.282
as big as a man.
Carry on, Arkin.

19:56.369 --> 19:57.805
Captain's ordered everyone
to abandon ship.

19:57.892 --> 19:58.849
Mm-hmm.

19:58.936 --> 20:00.199
But it was too late.

20:00.286 --> 20:01.852
'The Fremont sank.'

20:01.939 --> 20:03.463
All 200 souls aboard her.

20:05.291 --> 20:07.075
My grandfather said that

20:07.162 --> 20:10.209
even with all the noise
from the storm that night

20:10.296 --> 20:12.080
you could hear 'em
screaming for help.

20:12.167 --> 20:13.473
Hmm.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.475
Some nights,
people say that

20:15.562 --> 20:17.216
you can still hear
their cries on the wind.

20:18.913 --> 20:20.610
And no one
ever found the gold?

20:20.697 --> 20:21.872
What gold?

20:21.959 --> 20:23.918
The Fremont was
a treasure ship

20:24.005 --> 20:26.094
most famous
in Santa Marta history.

20:26.181 --> 20:28.052
Yeah, went down in 1906.

20:28.139 --> 20:29.663
She was carrying
all the annual treaty payments

20:29.750 --> 20:31.360
for the Indian tribes
up north.

20:31.447 --> 20:33.580
Hmm, crates of gold coins
and bullion

20:33.667 --> 20:35.843
sixty million dollars worth,
today's value.

20:35.930 --> 20:37.627
And it was never found?

20:37.714 --> 20:40.108
Nah, the San Francisco
earthquake happened

20:40.195 --> 20:42.676
a few weeks after the wreck.

20:42.763 --> 20:44.852
They think it buried
the ship for good.

20:44.939 --> 20:47.463
Mm, but you kept looking,
didn't you?

20:47.550 --> 20:51.467
[chuckles]
Yeah, I kept looking.

20:51.554 --> 20:52.686
Eh?

20:55.079 --> 20:56.777
Ten dollar, Liberty Head.

20:56.864 --> 20:58.257
- Gold Eagle.
- Oh!

20:58.344 --> 21:00.476
I found that
the summer of '72.

21:00.563 --> 21:02.478
[both chuckling]

21:02.565 --> 21:04.480
Best damn day of my life.

21:04.567 --> 21:05.742
Hell, I thought
I'd found the Fremont.

21:07.396 --> 21:10.443
I dove every day
for the next seven summers.

21:10.530 --> 21:12.140
I never found
another damn thing.

21:14.185 --> 21:15.448
She's down there.

21:16.623 --> 21:18.059
She's there.

21:18.146 --> 21:19.626
That's a great story,
Arkin.

21:20.844 --> 21:22.193
Thank you.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.544
Neo? Two-dog?

21:24.631 --> 21:26.328
I've gotta go.
I'll see you around.

21:26.415 --> 21:27.895
Thanks for the drink.

21:27.982 --> 21:29.853
Do you think Jay found
the Fremont's treasure?

21:29.940 --> 21:33.379
Well, Jayandhis partner.
You don't treasure hunt alone.

21:33.466 --> 21:35.685
He did know the salvage business
from working for Greg.

21:35.772 --> 21:37.687
- And he had a boat.
- Oh, boat, yes.

21:37.774 --> 21:39.036
I'd like to take
a look at that.

'Uh, speaking of Chief Anson..'

21:47.741 --> 21:48.959
Hey!

21:49.046 --> 21:51.005
Hey, that's my car.

21:51.092 --> 21:53.094
- What?
- My car.

21:53.181 --> 21:55.401
This is? Yours?

21:55.488 --> 21:57.577
Oh. Is it, really?

21:59.100 --> 22:01.058

22:01.145 --> 22:03.887

She's law enforcement.

22:03.974 --> 22:07.413
Hey, chief. Any luck with,
uh, Jay's missing boat?

22:07.500 --> 22:10.416
- It's not in Santa Marta.
- How do you know that?

22:10.503 --> 22:12.809
Because my men and I
searched everywhere in town

22:12.896 --> 22:15.551

of landandwater.

22:15.638 --> 22:17.074
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

22:17.161 --> 22:19.250
Most impressive.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.383
Thank you.

22:21.470 --> 22:22.602

a cop pimping for her

24:25.768 --> 24:27.727

what you are seeking

24:27.814 --> 24:30.904
it is because what you seek
is already in your possession.

24:32.253 --> 24:34.124
What kind of boat
did Jay Banner own?

24:34.211 --> 24:35.386
A gray lapstreak.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.301
Hmm, well, Jay
was a smart man

24:37.388 --> 24:39.303
who needed to park his
boat somewhere for free

24:39.390 --> 24:41.784
so why not put someone
else's plates on the trailer

24:41.871 --> 24:45.309
andletit get towed
by the very eager police?

to stash your boat'

24:48.008 --> 24:49.879

24:49.966 --> 24:52.055
And then Jay could
slip in through that gate

Ah! There it is.
The Hang Ten.

24:56.625 --> 24:57.887
Bingo, and I'm willing to bet

24:57.974 --> 24:59.759
that there is evidence
of Jay's treasure hunt

24:59.846 --> 25:02.022
maybe even the treasure
itself, on board.

Sound advice.

25:26.568 --> 25:28.570
You know what
Jane's theory is?

25:28.657 --> 25:31.138
If Jay really did salvage
the Fremont's treasure

25:31.225 --> 25:34.489
he had to have had a partner.
He couldn't have done it alone.

25:34.576 --> 25:36.535
A partner who killed him.

25:38.232 --> 25:40.756
What were you doing
on Jay's powerboat?

25:40.843 --> 25:43.019
He borrowed a life jacket.
I wanted it back.

25:43.106 --> 25:44.847
How did you even know
where to find the boat?

25:44.934 --> 25:46.719
Jay told me.

25:46.806 --> 25:47.981
Greg, stop it. Alright?

25:48.068 --> 25:49.156
Since I'm 17 years old

25:49.243 --> 25:50.374
I can tell when you're lying.

25:50.461 --> 25:51.506
That's funny,
'cause I could never

25:51.593 --> 25:52.812

were lying to me.

- Get outta here.

26:00.994 --> 26:02.125
Okay.

26:04.780 --> 26:06.086
See, I know you're lying

26:06.173 --> 26:08.262
because we found
the cleaning equipment.

26:08.349 --> 26:09.698
You were there
to wipe the place down

26:09.785 --> 26:11.047
a good way
to cover your tracks.

26:11.134 --> 26:13.049
Look, I didn't kill him.

26:13.136 --> 26:14.703
The morning of his
death, Jay's roommate

26:14.790 --> 26:16.879
saw a boat
heading toward shore.

26:16.966 --> 26:18.664
That was you. It was your boat.

26:18.751 --> 26:20.709
Look, sometimes
stuff looks bad

26:20.796 --> 26:22.537
and there's
an innocent explanation.

26:22.624 --> 26:24.234
- Okay, what's the explanation?
- You won't believe me.

26:24.321 --> 26:25.758
Try me.

26:27.150 --> 26:29.500
You know..

26:29.588 --> 26:33.592
...it took a long time for
me to get over you, Teresa.

26:33.679 --> 26:36.682
A long time...
but I finally did.

26:38.945 --> 26:41.730
It was your
boat that morning.

26:41.817 --> 26:43.123
Tell me the truth.

26:43.210 --> 26:44.472
Yes, it was my boat. Alright?

26:44.559 --> 26:45.691
I was out fishing.

26:45.778 --> 26:48.781
No luck.
I didn't catch anything.

26:48.868 --> 26:50.870
Talk to me. I can help you.

26:50.957 --> 26:52.828

- Mm.

27:03.317 --> 27:04.274
I'd like to ask you a few more

27:04.361 --> 27:05.885
questions about the Fremont.

27:05.972 --> 27:08.322
Then I've got some answers.

27:08.409 --> 27:10.759
"The Fremont?"
Is this about Jay's murder?

27:10.846 --> 27:14.067
Uh, yeah. In fact, there's about
to be a major break in the case.

27:15.546 --> 27:17.244
In that case,
it's on the house.

27:17.331 --> 27:19.159
Oh, thank you.

27:19.246 --> 27:21.117
Oop, it's my phone.

27:23.511 --> 27:25.687
I'm gonna have to take this.
I'll be right back.

27:31.171 --> 27:32.738

- No.

27:38.395 --> 27:39.658

equipment, right?

27:39.745 --> 27:40.833
Yeah, there was a bunch of 'em.

27:40.920 --> 27:42.051
'Expensive stuff.'

27:42.138 --> 27:43.313
Thanks.

27:46.360 --> 27:47.883
No problem.

27:53.584 --> 27:55.674
[indistinct chattering]

27:57.023 --> 27:58.764
Is any of your
equipment missing?

27:58.851 --> 28:00.679
Go away. Greg said
not to speak with you.

28:00.766 --> 28:03.246
Your salvage equipment,
we found some on Jay's boat.

28:03.333 --> 28:06.206
- So?
- So is any of it yours?

28:06.293 --> 28:08.861
If Greg was Jay's partner
in the salvage of the Fremont

28:08.948 --> 28:10.689
they would have used
your company's equipment.

28:10.776 --> 28:13.300
- Greg didn't do this.
- So prove it.

28:13.387 --> 28:14.736
Is any of your gear missing?

28:14.823 --> 28:16.477
No, it's all accounted for.

28:16.564 --> 28:18.218
So Jay used his own gear

28:18.305 --> 28:20.176
which means Greg
wasn't the partner.

28:20.263 --> 28:22.178
Oh, the killer, you mean?

28:22.265 --> 28:25.486
No, of course not.
Greg couldn't hurt anyone.

28:25.573 --> 28:27.967
He incriminated himself.

28:28.054 --> 28:30.665
Greg told me that he was
on a boat going to see Jay

28:30.752 --> 28:32.667
the morning of his death.

28:34.451 --> 28:37.280
I think he was lying
to protect someone else.

28:37.367 --> 28:39.108
[instrumental music]

28:39.195 --> 28:40.414
Yeah.

28:40.501 --> 28:42.155

28:42.242 --> 28:44.853
It was you on that boat.

28:44.940 --> 28:46.768
Greg made me
promise not to tell.

28:48.248 --> 28:50.990
For our girls, he said.

28:51.077 --> 28:53.166
You were having
an affair with Jay.

and the business and..

29:06.005 --> 29:08.834
Well, Jay was just fun and..

29:08.921 --> 29:11.401
No responsibilities.
It was just fun and..

29:14.230 --> 29:17.538
I wanted to imagine
a different life..

29:17.625 --> 29:20.410
...just for a while.

29:20.497 --> 29:22.369
I mean, haven't you
ever wanted to do that?

29:27.243 --> 29:29.115
Tell me what
happened that morning.

29:30.681 --> 29:33.989
I knew I had to
break it off with Jay.

29:34.076 --> 29:35.904
So I took the boat out
in the morning to end it.

29:37.950 --> 29:41.257
And then I came back and I
confessed everything to Greg.

29:41.344 --> 29:43.259
And I begged
for his forgiveness

29:43.346 --> 29:44.957
and he gave it to me.
God bless him.

29:45.044 --> 29:46.959
Did you kill Jay Banner?

29:47.046 --> 29:49.178
No!

29:49.265 --> 29:51.790
No, he was alive
when I left.

29:51.877 --> 29:54.357
But when Greg and I found
out that he'd been killed

29:54.444 --> 29:56.316
he said we had
to keep it a secret.

29:58.187 --> 30:00.407
He wanted to protect me.

30:00.494 --> 30:03.062
That gives Greg strong
motive to kill him.

30:03.149 --> 30:04.759
Well, he couldn't have..

30:04.846 --> 30:06.805
...because he was
at home with the girls.

30:07.936 --> 30:10.721
And besides, you know him.

32:03.269 --> 32:05.662
Look, I'm sorry.
You know, I-I-I..

32:05.749 --> 32:08.578
I know I've been bad.
It's just..

32:08.665 --> 32:10.363
I've been so bored.

32:10.450 --> 32:13.061
And this was such a rush.

32:13.148 --> 32:15.237
Summer, I had
to stop myself

32:15.324 --> 32:17.022
from hurting
him badly.

32:17.109 --> 32:20.329
I could have killed him.
You understand me?

32:20.416 --> 32:22.984
God...that's kind of hot.

32:23.071 --> 32:24.855
What's the hell
is wrong with you?

32:24.943 --> 32:26.814
You're really messed up,
you know that?

32:28.207 --> 32:30.949
Well, duh!
Like you're not?

32:32.689 --> 32:34.126
No! What are you doing?

32:34.213 --> 32:36.606
Stop it! Are you nuts?
It was mine!

32:36.693 --> 32:38.695
I worked for it, Cho!

32:38.782 --> 32:40.523
I'm a cop! How did you
think this was gonna go?

32:40.610 --> 32:41.568
[crying]

32:41.655 --> 32:42.656
[clatters]

32:45.093 --> 32:46.747
[crying]

32:46.834 --> 32:49.663
[instrumental music]

33:11.380 --> 33:13.513
[indistinct chattering on radio]

33:13.600 --> 33:14.905
Kitchen and den are clear.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.385
Copy that.

33:18.518 --> 33:21.173
- So is the attic.
- Roger.

33:21.260 --> 33:23.349
- Jane, what's going on?
- Treasure hunt.

33:23.436 --> 33:26.308
- Here?
- Gold's heavy.

33:26.395 --> 33:28.702
And it's hard to transport.
Difficult to store.

33:28.789 --> 33:30.747
They had to hide
the treasure someplace.

33:30.834 --> 33:33.054
Probably near wherever they
brought it into shore.

33:33.141 --> 33:34.795
To keep it safe before
they could sell the gold

33:34.882 --> 33:36.101
but why look here?

33:36.188 --> 33:39.713
Uh, Jeeter?
You were Jay's best friend.

33:39.800 --> 33:43.412
Jay was tricky, sly, always
a couple of moves ahead, no?

33:43.499 --> 33:44.544
Yeah.

33:44.631 --> 33:46.546
He was an operator, sure.

33:46.633 --> 33:47.982
He was an operator.

33:48.069 --> 33:49.810
Jay's partner
double-crossed Jay

33:49.897 --> 33:51.681
killed him,
but what he didn't know

33:51.768 --> 33:53.770
is that Jay
double-crossed him first.

33:53.857 --> 33:56.817
Jay moved the treasure
before he died.

33:56.904 --> 33:58.297
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

33:58.384 --> 34:00.429
And I'm guessing
he moved it here.

34:00.516 --> 34:01.778
I got something.

34:01.865 --> 34:02.823
I found this in the trunk

34:02.910 --> 34:04.172
of that Toyota out in the drive.

34:04.259 --> 34:06.131
Oh, yeah? What is it?

34:08.176 --> 34:09.308
Oh.

34:10.439 --> 34:11.571
[chuckles]

34:11.658 --> 34:12.746
'Treasure.'

34:19.231 --> 34:21.407
You found this
here, in the trunk?

34:21.494 --> 34:23.322
- Yep.
- This is amazing.

34:23.409 --> 34:25.541
No. No, it's awful.

34:25.628 --> 34:26.890
Why?

34:26.977 --> 34:30.416
Because the gold's gone,
maybe forever.

34:30.503 --> 34:31.591
I was slightly off.

34:31.678 --> 34:32.853
When Jay double-crossed
his partner

34:32.940 --> 34:34.115
he-he didn't bring
the gold here.

34:34.202 --> 34:35.551
He used this car
to take the gold

34:35.638 --> 34:36.987
somewhere else entirely.

34:37.075 --> 34:38.946
Or maybe the killer did.

34:41.340 --> 34:43.211
- Whose car is this?
- Mine.

34:45.605 --> 34:46.910
Jay had a key too.

34:46.997 --> 34:48.999
He must have borrowed it.

34:49.087 --> 34:50.827
Or maybe you
moved the gold

34:50.914 --> 34:52.264
after you killed Jay.

34:52.351 --> 34:54.353
- You, screw you, Tark!
- 'No, chill!'

34:54.440 --> 34:58.183
Chill, chill! This isn't
helping. So what now?

34:58.270 --> 35:00.489
Well, now we go home, watch TV.

35:00.576 --> 35:02.665
Rent "Treasure Island"
if it's not too depressing.

35:07.061 --> 35:08.715
Alright, what's
really going on?

35:08.802 --> 35:11.021
Cho and Van Pelt checked
that trunk. There was no coin.

35:11.109 --> 35:12.762
I've baited a trap, Lisbon.

35:12.849 --> 35:15.200
The killer will be compelled
to check on the treasure.

35:15.287 --> 35:17.811
"Bait." The coin. It was
Mr. Shea's, wasn't it?

35:17.898 --> 35:20.509
Well, he's not gonna mind.
It makes for a good story.

35:20.596 --> 35:22.468
His coin will catch a killer.

35:26.776 --> 35:28.300
[car doors close]

35:28.387 --> 35:30.737
Jay never moved
the gold, did he?

35:30.824 --> 35:33.870
Nope, it's still exactly
where he and the killer hid it.

35:33.957 --> 35:36.003
Only now the killer
is gonna feel compelled

35:36.090 --> 35:38.788
to check and see if
it really has moved.

35:38.875 --> 35:40.268
[engine starts]

35:53.020 --> 35:54.413
- So..
- Ahem.

35:54.500 --> 35:56.154
Why didn't you let me in
on your brilliant plan?

35:56.241 --> 35:58.243
Oh, you were very
busy with Greg.

35:58.330 --> 36:00.941
I'm never too busy
to solve a murder.

36:01.028 --> 36:04.292
Well, you seemed to be
very busywith Greg.

36:04.379 --> 36:06.381
Oh, hush.

36:06.468 --> 36:08.470
Alright, I'm hushing.

36:08.557 --> 36:09.689
[Jane]
'Look.'

36:09.776 --> 36:12.692
[intense music]

36:28.838 --> 36:30.318
[Jane]
Ahoy there!

36:30.405 --> 36:33.147
[Lisbon]
Put your hands in the air!

36:33.234 --> 36:34.192
[Jane]
'Ah.'

36:35.454 --> 36:36.716
Gladstone.

36:38.065 --> 36:39.849
And what do we have here?

36:41.547 --> 36:42.809
[latches click]

36:46.682 --> 36:50.033
Aye. That be the treasure.

36:54.168 --> 36:55.387
It was you that
discovered the location

36:55.474 --> 36:57.084
of the Fremont, right?

36:58.738 --> 36:59.695
Yeah.

37:01.219 --> 37:02.263
[Gladstone]
We had a big storm

37:02.350 --> 37:03.308
a month back.

37:03.395 --> 37:04.439
Shifted everything around.

37:04.526 --> 37:05.484
I could see the wreck

37:05.571 --> 37:06.876
on sonar clear as clear.

37:06.963 --> 37:08.356
[Van Pelt]
But you have asthma.

37:08.443 --> 37:09.923
You couldn't dive
for it yourself.

37:11.794 --> 37:14.710
Jay knew salvage...and I
knew he needed the bread bad

37:14.797 --> 37:17.147
so...we partnered up.

37:17.235 --> 37:18.845
And the morning he died?

37:21.848 --> 37:23.719
[Gladstone]
I saw Jay out on the beach.

37:25.504 --> 37:27.332
Thought I'd talk
to him, that's all.

37:28.855 --> 37:30.726
You know,
one partner to another.

37:33.425 --> 37:35.209
I had the hammer
on my belt, you know?

37:35.296 --> 37:36.428
[thud]

37:37.820 --> 37:40.040
I'm a peaceful man.

37:40.127 --> 37:42.347
I can't explain it.

37:42.434 --> 37:44.087
[Van Pelt]
You didn't wanna
share your treasure.

37:50.442 --> 37:53.183
He wanted half,
half of what I found.

37:54.489 --> 37:55.795
'I mean, is that right?'

37:58.798 --> 38:01.191
I don't know
what came over me.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.193
It's called greed.

38:06.632 --> 38:08.982
[birds squawking]

38:09.069 --> 38:11.027
[footsteps approaching]

38:11.114 --> 38:12.115
[Lisbon]
Hey.

38:13.465 --> 38:16.163
Oh, hey.

38:16.250 --> 38:18.687
I cleared it with Chief Anson.

38:18.774 --> 38:22.300
Nobody's gonna prosecute you
for breaking into Jay's boat.

38:22.387 --> 38:24.258
Well, thank you.

38:24.345 --> 38:27.870
You were there to wipe your
wife's prints, weren't you?

38:27.957 --> 38:31.961
Yeah, they met there
a couple of times, her and Jay.

38:32.048 --> 38:33.746
And I knew if you found
out about the affair

38:33.833 --> 38:35.443
you'd get the wrong idea.

38:35.530 --> 38:38.054
So you incriminated yourself.

38:38.141 --> 38:41.536
Hey, she's my wife.
I love her.

38:41.623 --> 38:45.018
I mean, it's gonna take a lot
of work, but I won't give up.

38:45.105 --> 38:47.673
You never did
give up on people.

38:47.760 --> 38:51.241
You're a good man.
She's lucky to have you.

38:51.329 --> 38:52.504
You're strong now,
you know that?

38:52.591 --> 38:55.202
You didn't used
to be so strong.

38:55.289 --> 38:57.509
I bet you're really
good at your job.

38:57.596 --> 39:00.816
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm okay, I think.

39:00.903 --> 39:03.558
You seem happy.

39:03.645 --> 39:05.212
I am.

39:05.299 --> 39:06.909
Yeah. I am.

39:06.996 --> 39:09.129
I'm glad we met again.

39:09.216 --> 39:11.436
You and me, you know?

39:13.786 --> 39:16.484
I'm sorry for running
off the way I did.

39:16.571 --> 39:18.660
Hey, it's no biggie.

39:19.618 --> 39:21.489
Forget it.

39:21.576 --> 39:24.449
[instrumental music]

39:27.408 --> 39:29.323
Take care of yourself.

39:30.933 --> 39:33.719
[music continues]

39:44.077 --> 39:45.774
Was Arkin mad
about the coin?

39:45.861 --> 39:48.951
No, like I said, it's another
story for him to tell.

39:49.038 --> 39:50.953
Always good to
have another story.

39:52.738 --> 39:54.653
Don't be wistful, Lisbon.

39:54.740 --> 39:56.306
Greg was never
the right man for you.

39:56.394 --> 39:59.484
I'm not wistful,
and, no, he wasn't.

39:59.571 --> 40:02.008
Far too intense and particular
for a man like that.

40:02.095 --> 40:04.445
Excuse me?
"Intense and particular?"

40:04.532 --> 40:06.491
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Well, they're good things.

40:06.578 --> 40:08.841
In what ways am I
"intense and particular?"

40:08.928 --> 40:11.017
- Oh, please.
- Tell me.

40:11.104 --> 40:14.063
Well, what ever happened
to that guy from narcotics?

40:14.150 --> 40:15.108
- Jeff?
- Jeff.

40:15.195 --> 40:16.370
Oh, he bit his nails.

40:16.457 --> 40:17.415
See, that's particular.

40:17.502 --> 40:18.677
That is not being particular.

40:18.764 --> 40:20.113
It's a disgusting habit.

40:20.200 --> 40:21.636
[Jane]
'There's intense.'

40:29.514 --> 40:31.385
Is your sister gonna
meet you at the station?

40:31.472 --> 40:35.258
Oh, yeah. She can't wait
to get me in her clutches again.

40:35.345 --> 40:37.435
- Okay, good.
- Yeah.

40:37.522 --> 40:39.306
Got, uh, spaghetti
and meatballs

40:39.393 --> 40:41.700
with the nephews,
and, um

40:41.787 --> 40:44.659
Seattle Community College,
here I come.

40:44.746 --> 40:46.661
Whoo-hoo.

40:46.748 --> 40:48.707
[instrumental music]

40:48.794 --> 40:50.665
This is the right thing.

40:52.798 --> 40:54.756
But I don't
wanna say goodbye.

40:56.802 --> 41:00.240
Maybe you could, uh,
come visit me sometime.

41:02.285 --> 41:04.113
Yeah. Maybe.

41:04.200 --> 41:05.985

That sounds romantic.

You better go.
