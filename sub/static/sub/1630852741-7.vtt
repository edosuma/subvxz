WEBVTT

00:02.275 --> 00:04.931
Julie: TWO SIDES OF THE
HOUSE AT ODDS.

00:04.965 --> 00:08.068
A TWO-TIME HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD
WITH DOMINATION ON HER MIND.

00:08.103 --> 00:13.000
AND A TWO-HOUR LIVE EVICTION
THAT PROMISES TO SEND ANOTHER

00:13.034 --> 00:18.206
HOUSEGUEST PACKING.
WELCOME TO "CELEBRITY BIG

00:18.241 --> 00:19.517
BROTHER"!
Announcer: PREVIOUSLY ON

00:19.551 --> 00:27.413
"CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER": THE DUO
OF SHANNA AND KIRKPATRICK WERE

00:27.448 --> 00:30.344
WORKING BOTH SIDES OF THE HOUSE.
IF YOU WANT TO WORK TOGETHER,

00:30.379 --> 00:32.137
IT'S STILL OPEN.
Reporter: THEY WERE TIGHT

00:32.172 --> 00:36.103
WITH CARSON AND CYNTHIA...
MY HEART SAYS I LIKE YOU

00:36.137 --> 00:39.068
GUYS.
> WELL, OF COURSE.

00:39.103 --> 00:43.103
Announcer: ...AND ALSO
ALINED WITH TODRICK AND MIESHA.

00:43.137 --> 00:48.758
KEEP THE TEAM SAFE AND USE
THE POWER WHILE YOU HAVE IT.

00:48.793 --> 00:51.068
Announcer: BUT THEY KNEW
THOSE TO WERE THE BIGGEST

00:51.103 --> 00:55.068
THREATS TO THEIR LONG-TERM GAME.
TODRICK IS STILL ALIGNED WITH

00:55.103 --> 00:56.344
HER.
I KNOW.

00:56.379 --> 01:00.000
EVEN,000 WE'RE ALIGNED WITH
MIESHA AND TODRICK, IT BENEFITS

01:00.034 --> 01:05.793
US IF WE STILL HAVE TODRICK AND
MISS CYNTHIA IN THE HOUSE.

01:05.827 --> 01:09.344
Announcer: WITH MIRAI AND
KATTAN ON THE BLOCK, CHRIS MADE

01:09.379 --> 01:13.241
A PLEA TO SAVE HIS FRIEND.
I LOVE YOU ALL AND I THINK

01:13.275 --> 01:17.034
IT'S TIME FOR ME TO MOVE ON.
AND YOU'VE BEEN VERY DEDICATED

01:17.068 --> 01:19.103
TO PLAYING THE GAME, AND IT'S
BEEN VERY IMPORTANT TO YOU.

01:19.137 --> 01:21.586
I WILL SEE YOU ALL ON THE
OUTSIDE.

01:21.620 --> 01:24.689
Announcer: BUT IT DIDN'T
STOP THE HOUSE FROM SAYING

01:24.724 --> 01:29.448
"LATER" TO THE SKATER.
Julie: BY A SHOW THE OF

01:29.482 --> 01:35.206
7-0, MIRAI, YOU ARE EVICTED FROM
THE "BIG BROTHER."

01:35.241 --> 01:36.379
HOUSE.
Announcer: WITH THE HEAD OF

01:36.413 --> 01:39.137
HOUSEHOLD BACK UP FOR GRABS, THE
CELEBS HIT THE SLOPES.

01:39.172 --> 01:46.241
THE ONLY WAY TO GUARANTEE MY
SAFETY IS TO WIN THIS H.O.H.

01:46.275 --> 01:48.862
Announcer: AND MIESHA
JUMPED BACK INTO POWER.

01:48.896 --> 01:53.275
THERE YOU GO.
LOOK WHO WON HER SECOND

01:53.310 --> 01:54.758
H.O.H.
THAT'S RIGHT, BABY.

01:54.793 --> 01:56.206
Announcer: CARSON AND
CYNTHIA WERE WORRIED.

01:56.241 --> 01:58.965
WE'RE TOAST.
WE'RE SO TOAST.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.068
MIESHA, MIESHA, MIESHA.
THAT'S ALL I EVER HEAR AROUND

02:03.103 --> 02:05.551
THIS PLACE?
THESE INCREDIBLE.

02:05.586 --> 02:09.275
AND NOW ME AND MY PEEPS NEED TO
FIGURE OUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO

02:09.310 --> 02:11.034
STAY IN THE GAME.
Announcer: BUT TODRICK HAD

02:11.068 --> 02:13.448
WORRIES OF HIS OWN ABOUT THE POP
STAR.

02:13.482 --> 02:17.068
DO YOU THINK IF CHRIS
KIRKPATRICK WINS AGAIN, HE'LL

02:17.103 --> 02:20.206
TAKE A SHOT AT ME?
I DO THINK THERE'S A GOOD

02:20.241 --> 02:25.448
CHANCE HE WOULD TAKE THAT SHOT.
I KNOW IIFICIALLY WANTED TO

02:25.482 --> 02:27.724
HELP GET CARSON OUT BUT CHRIS
KIRKPATRICK IS QUICKLY MOVING TO

02:27.758 --> 02:31.551
THE TOP OF MY TARGET LIST.
Announcer: AT THE

02:31.586 --> 02:34.310
NOMINATION CEREMONY...
I HAVE NOMINATED YOU, CARSON,

02:34.344 --> 02:38.448
AND YOU, CYNTHIA.
Announcer: ...CARSON AND

02:38.482 --> 02:39.862
CYNTHIA'S WORST FEARS WERE
CONFIRMED.

02:39.896 --> 02:43.068
THE ONLY WAY TO PLAY THIS
GAME IS TO GO BIG OR GO HOME.

02:43.103 --> 02:45.206
AND NOW THAT I'M ON THE BLOCK,
IT'S TIME TO FIGHT.

02:45.241 --> 02:48.482
BECAUSE IF I GET OFF, I'M COMING
FOR YOU.

02:48.517 --> 02:52.758
Announcer: TONIGHT, THE
POWER OF VETO IS ON THE LINE.

02:52.793 --> 02:57.793
THEN THE LIVE VOTE AND EVICTION
WILL SEND ANOTHER CELEBRITY

02:57.827 --> 03:01.827
PACKING.
AND AN EPIC BATTLE OF ENDURANCE

03:01.862 --> 03:04.448
BEGINS.
PLUS WITH THE GAME IN FULL GEAR

03:04.482 --> 03:07.206
AND LINES DRAWN IN THE SAND,
EMOTIONS EXPLODE.

03:07.241 --> 03:13.103
LISTEN.

03:13.137 --> 03:16.068
GO WITH YOUR PEOPLE.
Announcer: ALL THIS RIGHT

03:16.103 --> 03:20.034
NOW LIVE ON "CELEBRITY BIG
BROTHER."

03:20.068 --> 03:34.965
OH, MY GOD.

03:59.206 --> 04:02.448
Captioning funded by CBS

04:02.482 --> 04:04.482
Julie: GOOD EVENING.

04:04.517 --> 04:07.206
I'M JULIE CHEN MOONVES.
WELCOME TO "CELEBRITY BIG

04:07.241 --> 04:11.931
BROTHER."
IT'S DAY 17 INSIDE THE "BIG

04:11.965 --> 04:15.862
BROTHER" HOUSE, AND AFTER A
FAILED ATTEMPT TO GET CHRIS

04:15.896 --> 04:19.137
KIRKPATRICK TO TARGET CARSON
LAST WEEK, CURRENT HEAD OF

04:19.172 --> 04:23.379
HOUSEHOLD MIESHA HAS TAKEN
MATTERS INTO HER OWN HANDS,

04:23.413 --> 04:28.137
PUTTING THE TV PERSONALITY ON
THE BLOCK NEXT TO HIS CLOSEST

04:28.172 --> 04:32.206
ALLY, "REAL HOUSEWIFE," CYNTHIA.
BUT WITH THE POWER OF VETO STILL

04:32.241 --> 04:36.448
UP FOR GRABS, THERE IS NO
GUARANTEE THAT MIESHA WILL GET

04:36.482 --> 04:40.448
HER WAY.
SO WHO WILL WIN THE POWER OF

04:40.482 --> 04:42.068
VETO?
AND WHO WILL BE LEFT ON THE

04:42.103 --> 04:45.793
BLOCK WHEN THE HOUSEGUESTS VOTE
LIVE LATER TONIGHT.

04:45.827 --> 04:49.827
WE'LL FIND OUT SOON ENOUGH.
BUT FIRST, WITH LESS THAN TWO

04:49.862 --> 04:53.862
WEEKS AGO, THE NUMBERS ARE
DWINDLING, AND THE NOMINEES ARE

04:53.896 --> 04:58.689
STARTING TO FIGURE OUT WHO THEY
CAN AND CANNOT TRUST.

04:58.724 --> 05:05.931
THIS NOMINATION CEREMONY IS
ADJOURNED.

05:05.965 --> 05:09.206
Y'ALL BETTER LEARN TO BAKE
AND COOK.

05:09.241 --> 05:13.517
<i>[ LAUGHTER ].</i>
CYNTHIA.

05:13.551 --> 05:16.137
CARSON HAS BEEN IN MY SIGHTS,
AND I THINK THIS IS THE WEEK

05:16.172 --> 05:18.758
THAT I CAN TAKE HIM OUT OF THIS
GAME.

05:18.793 --> 05:22.758
IN TRUTH, I ADMIRE HIM.
HE HAS A TOP-NOTCH SOCIAL GAME.

05:22.793 --> 05:27.137
IT'S AN HONOR JUST TO BE
NOMINATED.

05:27.172 --> 05:32.206
FOR THE FACT THAT SHE'S RIDING

05:32.241 --> 05:36.034
WITH CARSON.
AND I THINK IF I CAN'T TAKE OUT

05:36.068 --> 05:38.655
CARSON, I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO
TAKE OUT HIS CLOSEST ALLY.

05:38.689 --> 05:42.034
BUT I'M REALLY NERVOUS ABOUT
THIS VETO COMPETITION, BECAUSE

05:42.068 --> 05:46.827
LAST TIME CARSON BLEW US OUT OF
THE WATER, I CAN'T HAVE THAT

05:46.862 --> 05:49.379
HAPPEN AGAIN.
IT'S ALL GOOD.

05:49.413 --> 05:52.241
IT'S A GAME.
IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF A DAY,

05:52.275 --> 05:58.275
SO MOMMY NEEDS HER MEDICINE.
HAVE I BEEN NOMINATED EVERY WEEK

05:58.310 --> 06:01.758
SO FAR?
IT JUST FEELS LIKE I AM SUPER

06:01.793 --> 06:05.413
POPULAR HERE.
WHY IS MIESHA SO OBSESSED WITH

06:05.448 --> 06:06.689
ME?
I DON'T KNOW.

06:06.724 --> 06:09.413
BUT I WON THE VETO ONCE BEFORE,
AND I'LL JUST HAVE TO WIN IT

06:09.448 --> 06:10.344
AGAIN.
IT'S ALL GOOD.

06:10.379 --> 06:11.448
YOU OKAY?
I'M GOOD.

06:11.482 --> 06:13.724
ALL RIGHT.
SHOCKER!

06:13.758 --> 06:18.620
OF COURSE I AM ON THE BLOCK.
AND, OF COURSE, MY BOY CARSON IS

06:18.655 --> 06:23.413
ON THE BLOCK RIGHT WITH ME.
AND ALTHOUGH TODRICK AND I ARE

06:23.448 --> 06:26.241
NO LONGER IN AN ALLIANCE
TOGETHER, I'M A LITTLE

06:26.275 --> 06:31.137
DISAPPOINTED THAT HE DIDN'T GIVE
HIS OLD ALLIANCE BUDDY OVER HERE

06:31.172 --> 06:33.689
A HEADS-UP.
AT THIS VERY MOMENT, I FEEL

06:33.724 --> 06:36.379
THAT CARSON IS THE BIGGEST
THREAT TO MY GAME JUST BECAUSE

06:36.413 --> 06:38.482
HE'S GOT SUCH A GREAT SOCIAL
GAME.

06:38.517 --> 06:41.620
ALL I NEED TO DO IS MAKE SURE
THAT CARSON DOESN'T WIN THIS

06:41.655 --> 06:46.965
VETO, SO WE CAN WRAP HIM IN A
PRETTY PINK BOW AND SEND HIM

06:47.000 --> 06:50.034
BACK OUT INTO THE WORLD TO
CONTINUE MAKING THE WORLD THAT

06:50.068 --> 06:52.034
MUCH MORE FABULOUS.
CARSON AND CYNTHIA ARE ON THE

06:52.068 --> 06:55.689
BLOCK AND THIS ISN'T GREAT FOR
MY NAME, BECAUSE SHANNA AND I

06:55.724 --> 06:58.275
HAVE BEEN KIND OF PLAYING THE
MIDDLE OF THE HOUSE, WHICH IS A

06:58.310 --> 07:02.931
REALLY DANGEROUS PLACE TO PLAY.
MIESHA'S BIG TARGET IS CARSON.

07:02.965 --> 07:06.413
IF SHE TAKES OUT CARSON ON THE
OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE, THEN

07:06.448 --> 07:10.172
THERE ARE NO BIG TARGETS LEFT
AND SHE'S GOING TO START LOOKING

07:10.206 --> 07:13.482
AROUND WHO'S LEFT.
THE NEXT STEP WOULD MOST LIKELY

07:13.517 --> 07:20.137
BE SHANNA AND I GO ON THE BLOCK.
WOW, JUST AS WE SUSPECTED

07:20.172 --> 07:28.275
WHY WOULD YOU NOT BE NICE TO

07:28.310 --> 07:30.758
CHRIS KATTAN AND NOMINATE ONE OF
US, ONE OF US.

07:30.793 --> 07:34.068
RIGHT.
AND LET THE POOR MAN GO HOME.

07:34.103 --> 07:37.931
SO I DON'T KNOW WHY MIESHA IS
MAKING THIS WEEK SO HARD ON

07:37.965 --> 07:39.034
HERSELF.
I MEAN, CHRIS KATTAN BASICALLY

07:39.068 --> 07:41.413
SAID HE WANTED TO GO HOME IN HIS
FIRST NOMINATION.

07:41.448 --> 07:45.620
AND THEN HE WASN'T FEELING WELL
IN THE LAST H.O.H. COMPETITION,

07:45.655 --> 07:51.896
SO JUST LET THE GUY GO.
ANYWAY,.

07:51.931 --> 07:53.310
I LOVE YOU.
I LOVE YOU.

07:53.344 --> 07:56.379
WE'RE GOING TO BE WONDERFUL.
I'M SO PROUD TO BE NOMINATED

07:56.413 --> 07:58.103
BESIDE YOU.
I THINK WE'RE AMAZING TOGETHER.

07:58.137 --> 08:05.206
I GUESS IT'S JUST US SUPER
MODELS.

08:05.241 --> 08:08.620
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
I THOUGHT MAYBE I WOULD HAVE

08:08.655 --> 08:11.103
GOTTEN A HEADS-UP, BUT, I MEAN,
I SUSPECTED.

08:11.137 --> 08:14.103
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT
IF THIS WERE MY DECISION, IT

08:14.137 --> 08:17.000
WOULDN'T BE THIS DECISION.
BUT I FEEL LIKE SOMETIMES

08:17.034 --> 08:21.965
PEOPLE, LIKE, ARE THINKING THAT
WE HAVE THE SAME DECISION.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.517
PEOPLE ARE LIKE, "WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?"

08:24.551 --> 08:29.137
I'M LIKE, "IT'S NOT 'US GUYS.
IT'S NOT MY H.O.H."

08:29.172 --> 08:32.379
I NEED TO TALK TO CYNTHIA AND
CLEAR THE AIR BECAUSE I'VE BEEN

08:32.413 --> 08:35.896
GETTING BLOOD ON MY HANDS FOR
THE DECISIONS MIESHA HAS MADE

08:35.931 --> 08:40.413
SINCE DAY ONE, AND I WANT HER TO
KNOW JUST BECAUSE I'M NOT IN HER

08:40.448 --> 08:44.000
ALLIANCE ANYMORE DESCENT MEAN I
CAN'T STILL BE FIGHTING FOR HER

08:44.034 --> 08:47.137
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE.
I GUESS WHAT I WOULD

08:47.172 --> 08:49.758
APPRECIATE GOING FORWARD THAT IF
THERE'S SOMETHING YOU COULD TELL

08:49.793 --> 08:52.793
ME THAT WOULD MAKE ME FEEL
COMFORTABLE.

08:52.827 --> 08:55.137
I FEEL LIKE WE'RE IN THE PART OF
THE GAME RIGHT NOW, WHERE PEOPLE

08:55.172 --> 08:58.310
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE
UNCOMFORTABLE DECISIONS.

08:58.344 --> 09:01.517
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
THE PEOPLE IN YOUR GROUP WHO

09:01.551 --> 09:04.310
ARE NOT HERE WOULD LOVE FOR YOU
TO WANT TO WORK WITH ME.

09:04.344 --> 09:07.206
YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME THIS WEEK.
THERE'S NO CHANCE IN HELL.

09:07.241 --> 09:11.034
DON'T TELL ME.
YOU'VE TOLD ME ENOUGH.

09:11.068 --> 09:19.172
OKAY.
I'M DOING MY FIRST WORKOUT.

09:19.206 --> 09:22.551
I THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT HOW THEY CAN GET US OUT OF

09:22.586 --> 09:23.551
HERE.
WHO?

09:23.586 --> 09:27.758
EVERYONE.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN "EVERYONE?"

09:27.793 --> 09:34.103
I THINK KIRKPATRICK AND
SHANNA, BECAUSE WE'RE MORE

09:34.137 --> 09:37.724
POWERFUL THAN THEY ARE.
YOU THINK THEY'RE SECRETLY

09:37.758 --> 09:38.896
PLOTTING?
UH-HUH.

09:38.931 --> 09:44.000
I THINK KIRKPATRICK IS.
NOW THIS I'M BACK IN POWER, I

09:44.034 --> 09:46.689
AM HOPING I CAN TAKE OUT MY
BIGGEST TARGET, CARSON.

09:46.724 --> 09:49.241
TODRICK IS RIGHT.
THE GAME IS GOING TO GET

09:49.275 --> 09:51.655
SMALLER, AND WE SHOULD BE AWARE
OF THE THREATS AROUND US.

09:51.689 --> 09:55.793
BUT FOR NOW, THERE'S STILL A
CONVENIENTO, AND THAT MEANS WE

09:55.827 --> 09:57.344
NEED TO WORRY ABOUT CARSON
FIRST.

09:57.379 --> 09:58.827
WE CAN DEAL WITH THE OTHER
THREATS LATER.

09:58.862 --> 10:06.068
YEAH, BUT ONCE CARSON'S GONE,
IT'S KIRKPATRICK THAT'S NEXT,

10:06.103 --> 10:07.310
YOU KNOW.
OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S ALL DIFFERENT

10:07.344 --> 10:14.034
KIND OF COMPETITIONS, BUT I
STILL FEEL LIKE OVERALL, ODDS

10:14.068 --> 10:15.310
ARE, IT'S, YOU KNOW, HE'S THE
ONE.

10:15.344 --> 10:17.965
CARSON IS DEFINITELY OUR MAIN
TARGET THIS WEEK.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.206
BUT IF CARSON COMES DOWN, CHRIS
KIRKPATRICK IS DEFINITELY

10:20.241 --> 10:22.793
SOMEBODY WE NEED TO BE KEEPING
AN EYE ON.

10:22.827 --> 10:31.000
THANK YOU FOR THE WORKOUT.
IT'S SO WEIRD SEEING HER FACE

10:31.034 --> 10:37.793
UP THERE.
YOU'RE, LIKE, JUST GOT REAL.

10:37.827 --> 10:42.379
LOOK AT YOU TWO!
MY FAVORITE NOMS

10:42.413 --> 10:46.758
HAIL, HAIL, THE NOMS ARE ALL

10:46.793 --> 10:48.034
HERE.
I DO NEED TO RIDE IT OUT,

10:48.068 --> 10:50.724
BECAUSE YOU ARE SO SMART AND SO
SAVVY.

10:50.758 --> 10:55.068
THANK YOU, CARSON.
YOU THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN

10:55.103 --> 11:04.620
HELP YOU BEFORE WE GO DOWN
BECAUSE IF I WIN THE VETO, I'M

11:04.655 --> 11:09.344
GOING TO USE IT TO SAVE YOU
THAT WILL GIVE YOU A LITTLE MORE

11:09.379 --> 11:13.000
TIME TO WORK WITH YOU.
I DON'T-- I DON'T FEEL

11:13.034 --> 11:15.034
COMFORTABLE WITH THAT.
WE CAN REVISIT IT.

11:15.068 --> 11:20.448
OKAY, BUT IF YOU WIN, YOU
ABSOLUTELY, 100% SAVE YOURSELF.

11:20.482 --> 11:22.482
OH, I HAVE TO GO THEN, IF YOU
SAVE YOURSELF.

11:22.517 --> 11:27.103
IS THAT HOW THAT WORKS?
SOMEONE ELSE WILL BE

11:27.137 --> 11:28.862
NOMINATED.
SO THEY COULD BACKDOOR ME.

11:28.896 --> 11:32.275
RIGHT.
SHE WILL BE THE NEXT ONE ON THE

11:32.310 --> 11:33.551
BLOCK.
TRUST THIS ROOM.

11:33.586 --> 11:37.241
ARE THEY ARE NOT HAVING, SO THE
ONLY WAY TO SHUT THEM DOWN AND

11:37.275 --> 11:41.413
SLOW THEM DOWN IS FOR ME TO--
I DON'T KNOW--

11:41.448 --> 11:44.551
NOT TO USE THAT.
I THINK WE NEED TO FLUSH THAT

11:44.586 --> 11:46.586
CONCEPT OUT.
WELL, THINK ABOUT IT.

11:46.620 --> 11:48.793
YOU'RE VERY GRACIOUS.
IT'S NOT ABOUT GRACIOUS.

11:48.827 --> 12:07.172
IT'S ABOUT TAKING DOWN THE SHIP.

12:07.206 --> 12:10.827
DID I HIT YOU IN THE FACE?

12:10.862 --> 12:12.620
DID I REALLY HIT YOU IN THE
FACE?

12:12.655 --> 12:16.034
NOPE.
YOU!

12:16.068 --> 12:20.586
BAD BOY!

12:20.620 --> 12:25.689
THAT IS SO NOT NICE!
YOU'RE A VERY GOOD ACTOR, AND I

12:25.724 --> 12:28.689
DON'T LIKE IT.
BAD BOY, TODD.

12:28.724 --> 12:37.862
GOT YOU!
WHAT DID YOU MAKE?

12:37.896 --> 12:43.103
CHICKEN BROTH AND MUSHROOMS.
LOOKS GOOD.

12:43.137 --> 12:44.379
ANYWAY...
...

12:44.413 --> 12:48.655
HOW DO YOU FEEL OVERALL?
I'M JUST WORRIED I'M GOING TO

12:48.689 --> 12:49.620
GET BACKDOORED.
THIS WEEK?

12:49.655 --> 12:56.448
YEAH.
IF ONE OF THEM TAKES THEMSELVES

12:56.482 --> 13:01.896
DOWN, MY FEELING IS SHE WILL PUT
ME UP.

13:01.931 --> 13:06.000
SO WE HAVE OPTIONS.
I HAVE SOME THINGS I WANT TO

13:06.034 --> 13:07.206
TALK TO YOU ABOUT.
OKAY.

13:07.241 --> 13:10.310
THINGS I'VE BEEN THINKING.
SO I GOT TO DO WHAT I WANTED

13:10.344 --> 13:13.586
LAST WEEK WHEN I WON H.O.H.
BUT IT'S CLEAR WITH MIESHA

13:13.620 --> 13:16.931
WINNING THIS WEEK THAT IT'S BACK
TO THE TODRICK AND MIESHA SHOW.

13:16.965 --> 13:20.172
AS LONG AS WANT POWER IS
CONSOLIDATED WITH THEM, IT'S

13:20.206 --> 13:23.103
CLEAR THAT SHANNA AND I ARE NOT
GOING TO GET ANYWHERE IN THIS

13:23.137 --> 13:25.827
GAME.
SO MAYBE WE NEED TO START DOING

13:25.862 --> 13:30.137
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.
IF YOU WIN THE VETO, YOU CAN

13:30.172 --> 13:34.827
TAKE CARSON OFF.
THEN YOU'D BE SAFE, AND CARSON

13:34.862 --> 13:37.448
WOULD BE SAFE.
THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THEY COULD

13:37.482 --> 13:43.586
PUT ME UP.
I'M WILLING TO TAKE THAT CHANCE.

13:43.620 --> 13:47.034
BUT IF YOU PULL CARSON DOWN,
YOU'RE ON THAT SIDE.

13:47.068 --> 13:50.551
YEAH, I KNOW.
IF YOU PULL CARSON DOWN, AND

13:50.586 --> 13:55.896
THEY DON'T PUT ME UP, WE'VE GOT
ME, YOU, CARSON, AND CYNTHIA

13:55.931 --> 14:00.655
STILL ON THAT SIDE.
SO THERE'S A HUGE RISK IN THIS

14:00.689 --> 14:03.241
THAT I MIGHT GO UP.
BUT I HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP

14:03.275 --> 14:06.275
WITH MIESHA, AND THERE'S A
POSSIBILITY SHE WON'T PUT ME UP.

14:06.310 --> 14:09.931
SO I FIGURED AT THE VERY LEAST
WE COULD GET CARSON DOWN.

14:09.965 --> 14:14.172
SURE, MAYBE THEY'D PUT ME UP,
BUT THEN EITHER ME OR CYNTHIA IS

14:14.206 --> 14:16.103
COMING BACK INTO THE GAME SO IT
KEEPS THE NUMBERS.

14:16.137 --> 14:21.517
NOW, IF I WIN, I CAN'T PULL
CARSON OFF BECAUSE THEY'LL PUT

14:21.551 --> 14:24.689
YOU UP.
TO GET ME, THEY KNOW TO GET YOU.

14:24.724 --> 14:27.137
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?
YES.

14:27.172 --> 14:29.620
I WANT TO SEE WHO GETS TO PLAY
IN THIS VETO.

14:29.655 --> 14:33.551
I KNOW WHAT CHRIS IS PITCHING IS
SUPER RISKY AND WE NEED, LIKE, A

14:33.586 --> 14:35.724
MILLION DIFFERENT THINGS TO GO
OUR WAY TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.

14:35.758 --> 14:39.758
BUT THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO SIT
AROUND AND LET MIESHA PICK US

14:39.793 --> 14:41.724
OFF, AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO
HAPPEN.

14:41.758 --> 14:44.517
SO IF WE GET THE CHANCE, WHY NOT
FIGHT BACK?

14:44.551 --> 14:48.275
I GET IT.
I'M WITH YOU.

14:48.310 --> 14:50.551
Julie: UNLESS YOU'VE PLAYED

14:50.586 --> 14:53.620
"BIG BROTHER," YOU REALLY DON'T
KNOW HOW CHALLENGING IT CAN BE.

14:53.655 --> 14:58.137
UP NEXT, ONE HOUSEGUEST
UNEXPECTEDLY LEAVES THE GAME.

14:58.172 --> 15:02.620
STAY WITH US.

15:13.862 --> 15:17.103
Julie: WELCOME BACK TO
"CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER."

15:17.137 --> 15:19.931
TONIGHT, THE HOUSEGUESTSARE
PREPARED TO EVICT ANOTHER

15:19.965 --> 15:21.862
CELEBRITY.
BUT WHAT THEY WEREN'T PREPARED

15:21.896 --> 15:34.689
FOR WAS ONE HOUSEGUEST'S
UNEXPECTED EXIT.

15:34.724 --> 15:38.103
OH, THAT MAKES ME HAPPY,

15:38.137 --> 15:40.310
LAMAR!
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN!

15:40.344 --> 15:42.689
TODAY IS GOING TO BE A GOOD
DAY.

15:42.724 --> 15:43.931
GOOD MORNING.
GOOD MORNING.

15:43.965 --> 15:48.689
HOW YOU FEELING TODAY?
I'M HAVING A VERY TOUGH TIME

15:48.724 --> 15:50.689
STILL.
NOT-- I WAS GREAT, NOW I'M LIKE,

15:50.724 --> 15:56.586
OKAY.
I WANT TO GO...

15:56.620 --> 16:15.517
LAWYER BACK HOME.

16:29.310 --> 16:32.620
HEY, EVERYBODY!
I HAVE AN IMPORTANT

16:32.655 --> 16:34.413
ANNOUNCEMENT.
CAN I HAVE YOU GUYS JOIN ME IN

16:34.448 --> 16:41.034
THE LIVING ROOM, PLEASE.
CAN I USE YOUR BLACK HAT?

16:41.068 --> 16:51.068
OH, MAN.
WHERE'S KATTAN?

16:51.103 --> 16:54.896
HOUSEGUESTS, I HAVE AN
IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT.

16:54.931 --> 16:58.517
CHRIS KATTAN WILL NOT BE
CONTINUING IN THE "BIG BROTHER"

16:58.551 --> 17:00.379
GAME.
WHAT!

17:00.413 --> 17:04.137
HE WANTS YOU ALL TO KNOW THAT
HE'S OKAY AND HE'LL BE SENDING A

17:04.172 --> 17:07.517
VIDEO MESSAGE LATER TO ADDRESS
HIS DEPARTURE.

17:07.551 --> 17:12.034
THANK YOU, HOUSEGUESTS.
WOW.

17:12.068 --> 17:16.827
MORE POWER TO HIM, RIGHT?
YEAH.

17:16.862 --> 17:19.034
CHRIS HAS BEEN REALLY
STRUGGLING.

17:19.068 --> 17:21.275
IT BREAKS MY HEART.
HE HAD SUCH A GREAT ENERGY AND

17:21.310 --> 17:26.034
WAS SO FUNNY IN THE HOUSE.
HAVING TO HEAR THAT CHRIS IS

17:26.068 --> 17:29.344
LEAVING THE SHOW WAS JUST
DEVASTATING.

17:29.379 --> 17:32.724
BUT HIS HAPPINESS IS THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING.

17:32.758 --> 17:35.827
HEY, GUYS.
I'M SORRY I NEVER GOT THE CHANCE

17:35.862 --> 17:38.793
TO SAY THIS INDIVIDUALLY AND SAY
THIS IN PERSON.

17:38.827 --> 17:42.689
I THINK A LOT OF YOU KNOW THAT
THIS EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN A

17:42.724 --> 17:47.172
DIFFICULT THING FOR ME TO DO.
AND I KNOW MY DEPARTURE SEEMED

17:47.206 --> 17:48.586
ABRUPT.
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT EACH

17:48.620 --> 17:52.103
ONE OF YOU HAS IMPACTED MY LIFE
SO MUCH.

17:52.137 --> 17:54.206
MIESHA, YOU'RE SUCH A
SWEETHEART.

17:54.241 --> 17:56.689
IT'S GOING TO BE SO GREAT TO
MEET YOUR FAMILY FINALLY AND SEE

17:56.724 --> 18:00.241
YOU FIGHT IN VEGAS.
CARSON, YOU KNOW I LOVE YOUR

18:00.275 --> 18:02.034
PEANUT BUTTER CAKES.
YOU'RE SO FUNNY, AND I CAN'T

18:02.068 --> 18:04.172
WAIT TO WORK WITH YOU ON THE
OUTSIDE.

18:04.206 --> 18:06.551
TODRICK, YOU HAVE THE BEST BUTT
IN THE BIZ!

18:06.586 --> 18:10.275
I CAN'T WAIT TO FILM WITH YOU IN
MY SHORTS.

18:10.310 --> 18:14.724
I MEAN MY VIDEO SHORTS.
TODD, I WILL NOT MISS YOUR

18:14.758 --> 18:18.000
SNORING.
BUT I WILL MISS YOUR HUMOR.

18:18.034 --> 18:20.241
YOU'RE A SWEETHEART.
LAMAR, YOU KNOW, JUST WATCHING

18:20.275 --> 18:25.482
TODD'S FACE IN REACTION TO
SMELLING ONE OF YOUR TOXIC

18:25.517 --> 18:28.103
FARTS, THAT'S A FASCINATING
THING I'LL MISS.

18:28.137 --> 18:30.724
BY THE WAY, LAMAR, YES, YOU
SHOULD PROBABLY SEE A DOCTOR

18:30.758 --> 18:32.310
ABUT THAT. <i></i>

18:32.344 --> 18:35.551
CARING AND ASKING ME EVERY
MORNING, "HOW ARE YOU DOING?

18:35.586 --> 18:38.137
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?"
I CAN'T WAIT TO MEET YOUR FAMILY

18:38.172 --> 18:40.172
AND YOUR LOVELY WIFE IN
NASHVILLE.

18:40.206 --> 18:41.689
CYNTHIA, YOU HAVE SUCH A BIG
HEART.

18:41.724 --> 18:45.413
THANK YOU FOR YOUR PANCAKES.
SHANNA, I'M SO GLAD THAT YOUR

18:45.448 --> 18:48.724
BOYFRIEND HAS A HAIR FETISH,
BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE

18:48.758 --> 18:53.172
BEST HAIR IN THE WORLD.
BEST OF LUCK TO ALL OF YOU FOR

18:53.206 --> 18:57.275
THE REST OF THE COMPETITION.
LET'S KEEP OUR FRIENDSHIPS, OUR

18:57.310 --> 19:02.172
CHEMISTRY, AND ALL THAT
HAPPINESS ALIVE.

19:02.206 --> 19:04.275
CHRIS KATTAN.

19:04.310 --> 19:07.862
<i>[ APPLAUSE ].</i>
CHRIS, I JUST WANT TO LET YOU

19:07.896 --> 19:13.344
KNOW THAT YOU ARE AN AMAZING
PERSON AND REALLY INSPIRATIONAL.

19:13.379 --> 19:14.551
YOU'RE GOING TO BE MISSED IN
THIS GAME.

19:14.586 --> 19:18.137
I'M SO HAPPY I GOT TO
EXPERIENCE THIS GAME WITH CHRIS

19:18.172 --> 19:19.551
KATTAN.
HE MADE A LOT OF THE MOMENTS

19:19.586 --> 19:22.758
WHERE I WAS DOWN A LOT BETTER.
I LOVE YOU, CHRIS.

19:22.793 --> 19:25.310
YOU'RE AWESOME.
THAT WAS REALLY SWEET.

19:25.344 --> 19:28.275
I THINK I'M GOING TO CRY.
I KNOW!

19:28.310 --> 19:33.482
I LOVED HAVING KATTAN HERE.
HE'S BEEN ONE OF MY COMIC IDOLS.

19:33.517 --> 19:37.068
CHRIS, I'M GOING TO MISS YOU
DESTROYING MY CAKES.

19:37.103 --> 19:40.586
THAT'S NOT A PUN FOR ANYTHING.
I'M SENDING LOTS OF LOVE, AND

19:40.620 --> 19:43.689
WHEN I BUST OUT OF THIS JOINT,
I'M GOING TO BAKE YOU A CAKE.

19:43.724 --> 19:45.793
I THINK HE MADE THE RIGHT
DECISION.

19:45.827 --> 19:50.965
YEAH.

19:51.000 --> 19:55.344
Julie: WE WISH CHRIS WELL.
WHEN WE RETURN, THE POWER OF

19:55.379 --> 19:59.275
VETO COMPETITION PLAYS OUT AND
COULD SAVE EITHER CARSON OR

19:59.310 --> 20:04.206
CYNTHIA FROM THE CHOPPING BLOCK.
PLUS, AN EPIC BATTLE OF

20:04.241 --> 20:06.724
ENDURANCE FOR HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD
WILL BEGIN LIVE.

20:06.758 --> 20:14.103
STAY WITH US.

20:22.965 --> 20:26.241
Julie: WELCOME BACK TO

20:26.275 --> 20:31.172
"CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER."
SO, CHRIS KATTAN IS OUT OF THE

20:31.206 --> 20:32.482
GAME.
BUT FOR THE REMAINING

20:32.517 --> 20:36.586
HOUSEGUESTS, IT'S TIME TO GET
REFOCUSED ON THE MOST PIVOTAL

20:36.620 --> 20:41.482
VETO OF THE SEASON.
HEY, EVERYONE.

20:41.517 --> 20:43.965
IT'S TIME TO PICK PLAYERS FOR
THE VETO COMPETITION.

20:44.000 --> 20:50.931
ALL RIGHT!
LET'S DO IT!

20:50.965 --> 20:55.448
ONLY SIX PEOPLE WILL
PARTICIPATE IN THE VETO

20:55.482 --> 20:58.103
THE HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD, THE TWO NOMINEES, AND

20:58.137 --> 21:01.344
THREE OTHER PLAYERS SELECTED BY
RANDOM DRAW.

21:01.379 --> 21:04.620
WILL THE NOMINEES PLEASE JOIN ME
UP HERE.

21:04.655 --> 21:11.172
COME, COME, YOU LOVELY PEOPLE.
THIS BOX CONTAINS A CHIP FOR

21:11.206 --> 21:16.000
EVERY ELIGIBLE HOUSEGUEST.
IN ADDITION TO THE CHIPS WITH

21:16.034 --> 21:20.724
THE HOUSEGUESTS' NAMES, SOME OF
THE CHIPS CONTAIN THE PHRASE,

21:20.758 --> 21:23.620
"HOUSEGUEST CHOICE."
IF HOUSEGUEST CHOICE IS PULLED,

21:23.655 --> 21:26.275
THAT PERSON IS ALLOWED TO SELECT
ANYONE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE

21:26.310 --> 21:30.413
VETO COMPETITION.
AS H.O.H., I WILL PICK FIRST.

21:30.448 --> 21:35.344
>I'M HOPING THAT EITHER TODRICK,
CHRIS KIRKPATRICK, OR LAMAR GET

21:35.379 --> 21:38.413
PICKED TO PLAY IN THE VETO
COMPETITION BECAUSE IF THEY WIN,

21:38.448 --> 21:45.000
I KNOW THEY'LL KEEP MY
NOMINATIONS THE SAME.

21:45.034 --> 21:46.965
SHANNA. <i>
[ APPLAUSE ].</i>

21:47.000 --> 21:52.000
I'M WORRIED ABOUT BEING A
REPLACEMENT NOM.

21:52.034 --> 21:54.034
I'M ALSO WORRIED ABOUT LOSING
CYNTHIA AND CARSON.

21:54.068 --> 21:58.758
THE ONLY HOPE I HAVE ON SAVING
MYSELF AND SAVING CARSON AND

21:58.793 --> 22:04.172
CYNTHIA IS BY WINNING THIS VETO.
I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WHO

22:04.206 --> 22:11.793
CAN WIN THIS COMPETITION AND
ALSO USE THE VETO TO SAVE ME.

22:11.827 --> 22:15.758
OH, HOUSEGUEST CHOICE.
FOR MY HOUSEGUEST CHOICE, I'M

22:15.793 --> 22:21.482
GOING TO GO WITH LAMAR. <i></i>

22:21.517 --> 22:26.551
PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE.
AND NUMBER TWO, HE SEEMS TO BE

22:26.586 --> 22:31.551
THE ONLY GUY OUTSIDE OF MY GROUP
THAT MIESHA DOESN'T HAVE IN A

22:31.586 --> 22:34.931
HEADLOCK.
OKAY.

22:34.965 --> 22:38.517
OH!
I LOVE THE PICKING PLAYERS

22:38.551 --> 22:40.827
PART.
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN SUCH A GREAT

22:40.862 --> 22:52.965
MEMORY FROM MIDDLE SCHOOL.
OKAY, I'M FINE.

22:53.000 --> 22:58.034
FLASHBACK.
TODRICK.

22:58.068 --> 23:02.965
<i>[ APPLAUSE ].</i>
OBVIOUSLY, GOING TO KEEP

23:03.000 --> 23:04.896
NOMINATIONS THE SAME.
I ALSO WANT MIESHA TO KNOW THAT

23:04.931 --> 23:07.413
I'M THERE FOR HER.
I WANT TO PROVE TO HER I'M

23:07.448 --> 23:10.896
SOMEBODY SHE CAN RIDE WITH UNTIL
THE END.

23:10.931 --> 23:13.965
"BIG BROTHER" WILL INFORM US
WHEN THE COMPETITION IS TO

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
BEGIN.
GOOD LUCK.

23:17.034 --> 23:20.862
TO SEND SOMEBODY HOME, RIGHT?

23:20.896 --> 23:23.000
NO.
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

23:23.034 --> 23:27.137
IF YOU WIN THE VETO, YOU HAVE
THE CHOICE TO EITHER TAKE

23:27.172 --> 23:31.103
SOMEONE DOWN AND THEN MIESHA
WOULD HAVE TO PUT SOMEBODY ELSE

23:31.137 --> 23:33.137
UP.
SO YOU COULD TAKE EITHER CARSON

23:33.172 --> 23:37.344
OR CYNTHIA DOWN.
YOU COULD SAVE THEM.

23:37.379 --> 23:41.862
BUT YOU CAN'T PUT SOMEBODY UP.
YOU CAN'T EVICT ANYBODY.

23:41.896 --> 23:45.448
CAN YOU SAVE BOTH OF THEM?
NO, YOU CAN ONLY SAVE ONE

23:45.482 --> 23:48.827
PERSON.
SO, YEAH, I DON'T WANT TO WIN

23:48.862 --> 23:52.379
WIN THE VETO.
I'M SURE LAMAR IS SMART IN A

23:52.413 --> 23:56.896
LOT OF WAYS, BUT HE DOES NOT
HAVE A DEGREE IN "BIG BROTHER"

23:56.931 --> 24:01.551
WOULD YOU SAVE ONE OF THEM?
YEAH.

24:01.586 --> 24:05.034
CYNTHIA BAILEY.
YOU SHOULDN'T SAVE HER--

24:05.068 --> 24:08.448
WHAT?
IF YOUR GOAL IS TO SEND OUT

24:08.482 --> 24:09.931
CARSON, THEN YOU SHOULDN'T SAVE
HER.

24:09.965 --> 24:17.000
I DON'T GET IT.
BABE, WE ARE TRYING TO GET

24:17.034 --> 24:19.689
CARSON OUT, SO DON'T START GOING
AROUND TALKING ABOUT SAVING

24:19.724 --> 24:23.482
PEOPLE IF YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW THE GAME WORKS, MR. ODOM.

24:23.517 --> 24:27.758
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?
BECAUSE IF SHE'S ON THE BLOCK

24:27.793 --> 24:30.413
WITH CARSON, WE CAN VOTE OUT
CARSON.

24:30.448 --> 24:33.448
IF SHE'S OFF THE BLOCK, SHE
SHOULD VOTE TO KEEP CARSON IN.

24:33.482 --> 24:36.793
WE VONT VOTE TO KEEP CARSON
IN.

24:36.827 --> 24:39.551
YES, SHE'LL.
THAT'S HER BEST FRIEND IN THE

24:39.586 --> 24:41.034
HOUSE.
DOES SHE HAVE A VOTE?

24:41.068 --> 24:47.000
IF SHE'S NOT ON THE BLOCK.
HE MIGHT VOTE JULIE CHEN OUT.

24:47.034 --> 24:49.862
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT LAMAR IS
GOING TO DO.

24:49.896 --> 24:51.620
SHE'S DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO
VOTE CARSON OUT.

24:51.655 --> 24:54.482
HEY, EVERYBODY!
IT'S TIME FOR THE VETO

24:54.517 --> 24:56.344
COMPETITION!
GET YOUR UNIFORMS ON AND LET'S

24:56.379 --> 24:58.896
GET READY TO RIDE!
OH!

24:58.931 --> 25:06.275
ALL RIGHT!
BOY, OKAY

25:06.310 --> 25:10.689
GO ALL THE WAY TO THE SLAIG.
OH, MY GOD!

25:10.724 --> 25:15.034
THIS LOOKS SO FUN!
REINDEERS ARE MY TOTAL SPIRIT

25:15.068 --> 25:16.931
ANIMAL.
I WATCH EVERYTHING WITH

25:16.965 --> 25:19.034
REINDEERS.
I POST BABY REINDEERS.

25:19.068 --> 25:23.413
I AM READY TO SADDLE UP AND FLY
OFF INTO THE SNOWY SUNSET.

25:23.448 --> 25:26.068
WELCOME TO THE REINDEER
ACADEMY.

25:26.103 --> 25:30.172
AS CELEBRITIES, YOU WILL RECEIVE
ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME INVITE TO

25:30.206 --> 25:32.379
RIDE SOME OF THE WORLD'S RAREST
REINDEERS.

25:32.413 --> 25:34.896
LIKE YOU, THESE REINDEERS ARE
VERY HIGH CLASS.

25:34.931 --> 25:40.448
IN FACT, THEY ONLY DRINK WATER
DELIVERED FROM FRESHLY FALLEN

25:40.482 --> 25:42.793
SNOWFLAKES.
ON "GO," RUN TO YOUR REINDEER,

25:42.827 --> 25:46.551
HOP ON AND START ROCKING.
ONCE YOU'VE ROCKED YOUR REINDEER

25:46.586 --> 25:51.689
BACK AND FORTH 20 TIMES, YOU'LL
GET 90 SECONDS TO STACK YOUR

25:51.724 --> 25:54.862
SNOWFLAKES ON YOUR REINDEER'S
GOBLET.

25:54.896 --> 26:01.551
YOUR GOAL IS TO STOCK AS MANY
SNOW ON YOUR GOBLET AS POSSIBLE.

26:01.586 --> 26:05.551
20 MORE REPS WILL GET YOU 90
MORE SECONDS OF STACKING TIME.

26:05.586 --> 26:08.896
WHEN YOU THINK THAT YOU HAVE
SNACKED ENOUGH SNOWFLAKES TO

26:08.931 --> 26:12.896
TAKE HOME THE WIN, PRESS THE
BUTTON AND LOCK IN YOUR SCORE.

26:12.931 --> 26:18.241
BEWARE-- IF THE CLOCK RUNS OUT,
THE EXPERIENCE IS OVER OVER.

26:18.275 --> 26:21.517
YOUR SCORE WILL BE ZERO.
THE PERSON WHO STACKING THE MOST

26:21.551 --> 26:24.310
SNOWFLAKES IN THE FASTEST TIME
WILL WIN THE GOLDEN POWER OF

26:24.344 --> 26:28.689
VETO.
WHO IS READY TO PLAY "REINDEER

26:28.724 --> 26:29.793
RIDERS!" <i></i>

26:29.827 --> 26:33.034
I NEED TO WIN THIS
COMPETITION BECAUSE I HAVE TO

26:33.068 --> 26:37.344
KEEP CARSON ON THE BLOCK AND
KEEP MY NOMINATIONS EXACTLY THE

26:37.379 --> 26:40.896
WAY I INTEND FOR THEM TO BE.
I CANNOT AFFORD FOR HIM TO SLIP

26:40.931 --> 26:45.517
THROUGH MY FINGERS.
I'M ON THE BLOCK AGAIN, SO I

26:45.551 --> 26:55.000
KNOW THAT I, OR CYNTHIA, OR
SHANNA, ABSOLUTELY MUST SLEIGH.

26:55.034 --> 26:58.275
I'M QUITE CONFIDENT WE'LL FIGURE
OUT A WAY TO SAVE THE DAY.

26:58.310 --> 27:01.034
I CAN'T WAIT TO MOUNT MY
REINDEER.

27:01.068 --> 27:02.310
I WAS ON PRANCER.
PRANCER?

27:02.344 --> 27:04.793
I HARDLY KNOW HER

27:04.827 --> 27:08.862
LET'S GO, GUYS.
LET'S GO, YOU GUYS.

27:08.896 --> 27:16.655
COME ON NOW!
GOOD LUCK.

27:16.689 --> 27:20.517
IN THIS COMPETITION, I HAVE
TO HOLD ON FOR DEAR LIFE,

27:20.551 --> 27:24.413
ROCKING THIS LITTLE FELLOW BACK
AND FORTH 20 TIMES.

27:24.448 --> 27:29.551
ONCE THE TIMER STARTS, I HAVE 90
SECONDS TO STACK SNOWFLAKES ON

27:29.586 --> 27:32.000
THE GOBLET.
AND THEN I HAVE TO RACE BACK TO

27:32.034 --> 27:36.517
MY REINDEER AND START ROCKING
AGAIN BEFORE THE TIME RUNS OUT.

27:36.551 --> 27:42.448
WHOEVER STACKS THE MOST
SNOWFLAKES ON THE GOBLET WINS

27:42.482 --> 27:43.931
THE GOLDEN POWER OF VETO.
FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO GET ALL

27:43.965 --> 27:48.172
OF MY SNOWFLAKES IN ONE PLACE.
MY STRATEGY IS TO START WITH THE

27:48.206 --> 27:52.000
BIGGEST SNOWFLAKES ON THE
BOTTOM, AND THEN STACK SMALLER

27:52.034 --> 27:58.517
AND SMALLER SO I HAVE A NICE,
STURDY STRUCTURE.

27:58.551 --> 28:04.103
LOOK AT THEM GO!
STRENGTH SEEMS LIKE IT'S

28:04.137 --> 28:07.344
GOING TO BE IMPORTANT AS WELL AS
QUICK HANDS.

28:07.379 --> 28:09.551
I'M HOPING I CAN ROCK THIS
REINDEER FOR VICTORY.

28:09.586 --> 28:13.413
MAKE SURE TO WATCH YOUR CLOCK
OR YOU WILL TIME OUT.

28:13.448 --> 28:15.379
LAMAR LOOKS ABSOLUTELY
RIDICULOUS ON THE REINDEER.

28:15.413 --> 28:18.448
HIS FEET ARE TOUCHING THE
GROUND.

28:18.482 --> 28:23.034
HE LOOKS LIKE A CHILD, LIKE, ON
A HORSE AT THE GROCERY STORE.

28:23.068 --> 28:26.689
IT'S JUST SO SILLY.
I'M LOOKING AT THIS

28:26.724 --> 28:28.275
COMPETITION, AND IT'S LIKE
PLAYING BASKETBALL.

28:28.310 --> 28:33.517
YOU HAVE A 24-SECOND SHOT CLOCK.
WELL, THIS TIME IF YOUR CLOCK

28:33.551 --> 28:35.448
HITS ZERO, YOU'RE OUT OF THE
GAME.

28:35.482 --> 28:38.034
THERE'S NO DEFENSE TO FALL BACK
ON.

28:38.068 --> 28:41.896
I PUT MY BEST FOOT FORWARD AND
LET THE SNOWFLAKES FALL WHERE

28:41.931 --> 28:44.689
THEY MAY.
IF I DON'T WIN THE VETO, I'M

28:44.724 --> 28:49.068
HOPING THAT CARSON, LAMAR, OR
SHANNA WINS IT IT.

28:49.103 --> 28:51.689
THAT WAY WE HAVE SOME OPTIONS.
CALL ME CRAZY, BUT I DON'T THINK

28:51.724 --> 28:54.724
THE PEOPLE THAT PUT ME UP HERE
ARE GOING TO BE THE ONES TO TAKE

28:54.758 --> 28:57.551
ME DOWN, SO, NO, I DON'T WANT
THEM TO WIN.

29:06.827 --> 29:09.551
AAAH!
COME ON!

29:09.586 --> 29:11.448
I'M GOING TO QUIT.

29:11.482 --> 29:14.068
I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE
REINDEERS THAT FLY.

29:14.103 --> 29:18.344
REINDEERS ARE FOR REAL, THOUGH,
RIGHT?

29:18.379 --> 29:21.482
AND LAMAR HAS TIMED OUT.

29:21.517 --> 29:23.517
IT'S OVER?
THAT'S IT, BROTHER.

29:23.551 --> 29:26.620
HAVE A SEAT.
OH, COME ON!

29:26.655 --> 29:34.034
THE HELL WITH THIS GAME!
SO WHILE YOU'RE BUILDING AND

29:34.068 --> 29:40.689
BALANCING AND STRAPT JIEZING,
YOU'VE ALSO GOT TO KEEP AN EYE

29:40.724 --> 29:45.517
ON THE CLOCK.
YOU REALLY NEED NERVES OF STEEL

29:45.551 --> 29:49.517
FOR THIS.
THE MOST DIFFICULT PART ABOUT

29:49.551 --> 29:53.758
STACKING THESE SNOWFLAKES IS
THAT THEY'RE SUCH ODD SHAPES AND

29:53.793 --> 30:00.172
WINCH WEIGHTS.
I NEED TO START WITH A GOOD

30:00.206 --> 30:04.206
BASE.
THE ONES THAT ARE STURDIER AND

30:04.241 --> 30:05.275
HEAVIER NEED TO GO ON THE
BOTTOM.

30:05.310 --> 30:07.827
TIME MANAGEMENT IS NOT MY
STRONG POINT.

30:07.862 --> 30:11.172
I AM DOING MY BEST TO FOCUS ON
THE CLOCK, BUT I AM AN ATHLETE.

30:11.206 --> 30:13.965
WHEN YOU GIVE ME AN OBJECTIVE, I
DON'T WANT TO TAKE MY EYE OFF

30:14.000 --> 30:19.448
THE PRIZE.

30:19.482 --> 30:24.655
MIESHA, YOU HAVE TIMED OUT.
NOW IT'S GOING TO TO BE UP TO

30:24.689 --> 30:28.965
TODRICK TO SECURE VICTORY FOR
OUR ALLIANCE.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.551
WELL, THE CLOCK QUEEN JUST
TIMED OUT, SO THAT ACTUALLY

30:32.586 --> 30:35.620
GIVES THE REST OF US A CHANCE TO
WIN THIS COMPETITION.

30:35.655 --> 30:38.931
THIS SO LIGHTS A FIRE UNDER MY
BUTT TO KEEP GOING AND TRY TO

30:38.965 --> 30:41.965
WIN THIS COMPETITION.
AND WE'RE DOWN TO OUR FINAL

30:42.000 --> 30:45.034
FOUR.
I AM GOING AS FAST AS I CAN,

30:45.068 --> 30:47.586
BUT SHANNA AND CARSON AND
CYNTHIA ARE STILL GOING.

30:47.620 --> 30:51.172
I DON'T WANT TO BUZZ IN WITH MY
CURRENT STACK ONLY TO HAVE ONE

30:51.206 --> 30:54.206
OF THEM BEAT ME, SO I JUST NEED
TO KEEP GOING AND TRY TO BUILD

30:54.241 --> 31:12.379
MY STACK EVEN HIGHER.

31:12.413 --> 31:15.172
CYNTHIA'S THE FIRST TO LOCK

31:15.206 --> 31:17.000
IN WITH A SCORE OF NINE.
GOOD JOB.

31:17.034 --> 31:21.482
I LOCK IN MY STACK AT NINE
SNOWFLAKES.

31:21.517 --> 31:25.103
I'M BANKING ON EVERYONE TO
EITHER TIME OUT OR HAVE THEIR

31:25.137 --> 31:30.379
HIGH STACKS COLLAPSE.
WHILE I'LL JUST HOLD STEADY WITH

31:30.413 --> 31:33.482
MY NINE SNOWFLAKES.
NINE?

31:33.517 --> 31:40.965
NINE SNOWFLAKES, CYNTHIA?
THAT'S HARDLY A PILE.

31:41.000 --> 31:45.206
WOW!
THAT WAS CLOSE!

31:45.241 --> 31:49.965
I'VE GOT 22 SNOWFLAKES
STACKED ON MY GOBLET.

31:50.000 --> 31:53.482
I COULD KEEP GOING, BUT I DON'T
WANT TO RISK MY SNOWFLAKES FROM

31:53.517 --> 31:55.689
FALLING OVER

31:55.724 --> 31:59.275
SHANNA LOCKED IN 22, BUT
TODRICK AN CARSON ARE HOT ON

31:59.310 --> 32:00.517
HER TRAIL.
AMAZING.

32:00.551 --> 32:04.758
I LOCK IN MY SCORE WITH 22
SNOWFLAKES, AND I'M FEELING

32:04.793 --> 32:06.827
PRETTY CONFIDENT.
AT THIS POINT, I'M JUST HOPING

32:06.862 --> 32:11.413
THAT MY STACK IS ENOUGH TO BEAT
EVERYBODY ELSE.

32:11.448 --> 32:19.689
I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO WIN.
SHE'S NOT MY TARGET.

32:19.724 --> 32:22.344
IF YOU WANT TO, THAT'S JUST, YOU
KNOW...

32:22.379 --> 32:23.724
IF YOU WANT TO DO THAT, THAT'S
OKAY.

32:23.758 --> 32:26.827
IT'S LOOKING LIKE SHANNA
MIGHT WIN THIS VETO COMPETITION.

32:26.862 --> 32:31.448
AND IF SHE DOES, SHE HAS THE
POWER TO MOVE NOMINATIONS IN ANY

32:31.482 --> 32:35.689
WAY THAT SHE SEES FIT.
SO MY GOAL IS TO DIVERT

32:35.724 --> 32:42.172
ATTENTION AWAY FROM CARSON AND
ONLY TAKE CYNTHIA DOWN.

32:42.206 --> 32:44.931
JUST SO LONG AS YOU KEEP
CARSON UP.

32:44.965 --> 32:48.137
I DON'T KNOW WHAT MIESHA'S
ANGLE IS.

32:48.172 --> 32:50.482
THE COMPETITION ISN'T EVEN OVER
YET.

32:50.517 --> 32:54.655
"I'LL TOTALLY DO WHAT YOU WANT
ME TO DO, MIESHA."

32:54.689 --> 32:58.172
I DON'T THINK SO.
THERE'S JUST TWO OF US.

32:58.206 --> 33:01.068
I'M STACKING AS PEST AS I CAN.
BECAUSE I WOULD REALLY LOVE TO

33:01.103 --> 33:05.034
WIN THIS FOR ME BECAUSE THAT'S
THE ONLY WAY I CAN BE ABSOLUTELY

33:05.068 --> 33:09.517
CERTAIN THAT I'LL BE SAFE.
AND I ALSO LOOK REALLY GOOD IN

33:09.551 --> 33:12.379
GOLD.
GO, CARSON!

33:12.413 --> 33:15.896
ME AND CARSON ARE THE ONLY
TWO LEFT.

33:15.931 --> 33:21.517
MIDMIESHA HAS ALREADY TIMED OUT.
WE ARE RUNNING BACK AND FORTH,

33:21.551 --> 33:25.000
BACK AND FORTH, RIDING THESE
REINDEER.

33:25.034 --> 33:26.000
TENSIONS ARE HIGH.
FUDGE!

33:26.034 --> 33:33.448
I HAVE TO WIN THIS.

33:33.482 --> 33:36.241
SO SHANNA'S ALREADY LOCKED IN
WITH A SCULPTURE OF 22

33:36.275 --> 33:39.172
SNOWFLAKES AND I HAVE GOT TO BE
LASER FOCUSED.

33:39.206 --> 33:43.344
SO I DON'T SLIP UP AND RUIN
CHRISTMAS FOR EVERYONE.

33:43.379 --> 33:51.206
WELL, IT'S NOT CHRISTMAS, BUT
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

33:51.241 --> 33:54.000
AND CARSON HAS TIMED OUT.

33:54.034 --> 33:56.275
DID I JUST RUN OUT OF TIME?
YOU DID.

33:56.310 --> 33:59.379
I DID.
CARSON HAS TIMED OUT.

33:59.413 --> 34:03.344
BUT WHAT I NEED TO DO IS JUST
FOCUS AND WORRY ABOUT STACKING

34:03.379 --> 34:09.310
THESE SNOWFLAKES.

34:09.344 --> 34:11.206
OH, MY GOD, I RAN OUT OF
TIME.

34:11.241 --> 34:18.344
SHANNA WITH A SCORE OF 22,
YOU WIN THE GOLDEN POWER OF

34:18.379 --> 34:19.379
VETO! <i>
[ APPLAUSE ].</i>

34:19.413 --> 34:22.758
VETO?
I DID.

34:22.793 --> 34:25.517
HOPEFULLY NOW WITH THIS VETO
WIN, I CAN COME UP WITH A PLAN

34:25.551 --> 34:30.896
TO SAVE CARSON AND CYNTHIA FROM
EVICTION.

34:30.931 --> 34:33.206
I'M BUMMED THAT I MISSED MY
TIME.

34:33.241 --> 34:36.172
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE
BLITZING MY WAY TO A VICTORY

34:36.206 --> 34:40.517
HERE, BUT I GOT CAUGHT SNOOZING.
HOPEFULLY SHANNA WON'T USE THE

34:40.551 --> 34:43.310
POWER OF VETO SORE I DON'T HAVE
TO NAME A REPLACEMENT NOM.

34:43.344 --> 34:45.862
MY PLAN TO GET CARSON OUT THIS
WEEK CAN STILL HAPPEN.

34:45.896 --> 34:50.068
I JUST NEED TO TALK TO SHANNA.
SO I'M VERY EXCITED THAT

34:50.103 --> 34:53.482
SHANNA WON THE VETO.
BECAUSE NOW THAT MEANS SHANNA

34:53.517 --> 34:57.241
HAS CONTROL OF EITHER TAKING
SOMEBODY DOWN OR KEEPING THE

34:57.275 --> 34:59.448
NOMINATIONS THE SAME.
BUT DO WE REALLY WANT TO DO

34:59.482 --> 35:01.551
THAT?
OR DO WE WANT TO SHAKE THINGS UP

35:01.586 --> 35:07.862
A LITTLE BIT?
Julie: UP NEXT, NOW THAT

35:07.896 --> 35:12.655
SHANNA HAS WON HER SECOND VETO
IN A ROW, WILL SHE CROSS THE

35:12.689 --> 35:15.448
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD AND DRAW A
LINE IN THE SAND?

35:15.482 --> 35:21.517
STAY WITH US.

35:35.068 --> 35:37.793
"CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER."
KNOWING THAT SHANNA COULD USE

35:37.827 --> 35:47.724
THE VETO, MIESHA MUST ONCE AGAIN
FACE A DIFFICULT CHOICE.

35:56.310 --> 36:01.344
THAT WAS CRAZY.
THAT WASN'T EASY.

36:01.379 --> 36:05.206
NOW THAT SHANNA HAS WON THE
VETO COMPETITION, I REALIZE THAT

36:05.241 --> 36:08.551
I MIGHT NEED TO COME UP WITH A
REPLACEMENT NOMINEE.

36:08.586 --> 36:12.275
SO IT'S TIME TO CONSULT WITH MY
ALLIANCE AND SEE IF ANYBODY IS

36:12.310 --> 36:17.586
WILLING TO BE THE PAWN.
BY THE WAY, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO

36:17.620 --> 36:22.379
PROBABLY PUT SOMEONE ELSE UP.
OBVIOUSLY, THE GOAL IS...

36:22.413 --> 36:27.896
STILL TO GET CARSON OUT.
I WAS GOING TO ASK, LIKE, WHO

36:27.931 --> 36:28.862
DOESN'T MIND--
YOU CAN PUT ME UP.

36:28.896 --> 36:30.551
I DON'T MIND.
MIESHA AND I HAVE BEEN VERY

36:30.586 --> 36:33.862
CLOSE THROUGHOUT THE GAME.
I BELIEVE MIESHA IS ABOUT

36:33.896 --> 36:35.965
LOYALTY.
I'M WILLING TO BACK HER AND

36:36.000 --> 36:38.206
PROTECT HER RIGHT NOW.
IF SHE NEEDS FOUGHT ME ON THE

36:38.241 --> 36:41.896
BLOCK I TRUST HER AND I'LL GO UP
AND BE NERVOUS AS HELL.

36:41.931 --> 36:44.137
THE PERSON WHO GOES UP
DOESN'T GO ANYWHERE.

36:44.172 --> 36:45.448
I KNOW.
WE KNOW.

36:45.482 --> 36:52.103
WE HOLD THE NUMBERS RIGHT NOW.
SHE'S COMING AROUND.

36:52.137 --> 36:56.103
LAMY, YOU LOOK REALLY GOOD IN
RIDING TOES.

36:56.137 --> 36:58.310
YEAH.
JUST SAYING.

36:58.344 --> 37:06.758
GET YOU ON A POLO TEAM WITH THAT
WING SPAN.

37:06.793 --> 37:11.517
COME IN.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

37:11.551 --> 37:15.724
I JUST OVERHEARD THEM.
THEY'RE GOING TO PUT TODD UP.

37:15.758 --> 37:18.827
- AS A PAWN. .
- WE FLIP IT.

37:18.862 --> 37:22.551
WE VOTE TODD OUT.
MY HEAD IS STILL, LIKE, SPIN

37:22.586 --> 37:24.241
PENTAGON UPON DO YOU WANT ME TO
TAKE CARSON DOWN?

37:24.275 --> 37:26.206
YES.
SHE PUTS TODD UP.

37:26.241 --> 37:29.827
WE WIN.
BECAUSE ME, YOU, AND CARSON CAN

37:29.862 --> 37:31.551
VOTE FOR CYNTHIA.
RIGHT.

37:31.586 --> 37:33.655
AND TODD WILL GO HOME.
OKAY.

37:33.689 --> 37:37.448
SO SHANNA WINS THE VETO.
WE COULD PLAY IT SAFE AND JUST

37:37.482 --> 37:40.413
KEEP THE NOMINATIONS THE SAME,
BUT DO WE REALLY WANT TO DO THAT

37:40.448 --> 37:43.344
OR DO WE WANT TO SHAKE THINGS UP
A LITTLE BIT?

37:43.379 --> 37:45.137
THERE'S A CHANCE I COULD GO
HOME.

37:45.172 --> 37:47.448
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF MIESHA
PUTS UP TODD.

37:47.482 --> 37:50.000
BUT THERE'S ALSO THE CHANCE THAT
SHE COULD PUT ME UP.

37:50.034 --> 37:54.172
BUT I'M WILLING TO ROLL THE DICE
AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

37:54.206 --> 37:57.689
LET'S DO IT.

37:57.724 --> 38:11.000
LET'S DO IT.
WE WANT TO TAKE YOU DOWN AND

38:11.034 --> 38:14.241
HAVE THEM PUT UP TODD AND THEN
VOTE TODD OUT.

38:14.275 --> 38:16.551
I'M DOWN WITH THAT.
A PLAN?

38:16.586 --> 38:22.241
DID I HEAR A PLAN TO SAVE ME?
I'VE SAID BEFORE, THESE EYEBROWS

38:22.275 --> 38:27.724
DON'T RAISE, BUT FOR THIS ONE,
THEY STARTED WORKING.

38:27.758 --> 38:31.206
LOOK AND THEN WE HAVE TO WIN THE

38:31.241 --> 38:38.241
NEXT H.O.H. BECAUSE THEY'RE
GOING TO BE GUNNING FOR US.

38:38.275 --> 38:42.206
CAN YOU IMAGINE?
WE NEED TO GET CYNTHIA OFF.

38:42.241 --> 38:52.620
100%.
YEAH.

38:52.655 --> 38:55.344
HOW YOU FEELING?
I'M CONFUSED.

38:55.379 --> 39:00.379
ABOUT WHAT?
ABOUT WHAT?

39:00.413 --> 39:02.655
NEXT MOVE, BECAUSE I THINK
CHRIS IS STRESSING SO MUCH

39:02.689 --> 39:06.137
BECAUSE HE'S THINKING IF HE WINS
THE NEXT H.O.H., IT'S TIME TO

39:06.172 --> 39:10.000
PULL THE TRIGGER
FINALLY, MIESHA IS STARTING

39:10.034 --> 39:14.241
TO OPEN HER EYES AND REALIZE
WHAT I'VE BEEN TELLING HER ABOUT

39:14.275 --> 39:16.551
CHRIS KIRKPATRICK AND SHANNA,
THEY ARE BOTH DANGEROUS IN THIS

39:16.586 --> 39:18.241
GAME.
AND THEY ARE DEFINITELY

39:18.275 --> 39:21.379
STRATEGIZING WAYS TO GET US OUT.
IF WE DON'T TRY TO TAKE A SHOT

39:21.413 --> 39:25.172
AT THEM THIS WEEK, NEXT WEEK, WE
COULD BE THE ONES ON THE BLOCK.

39:25.206 --> 39:28.793
IT'S, LIKE, HIS MANNERISMS
AND EVERYTHING HAVE CHANGED.

39:28.827 --> 39:30.827
YEAH.
SO NOW I FEEL LIKE WE ARE

39:30.862 --> 39:33.758
BOTH IN JEOPARDY.
I'M DEFINITELY SENSING THAT

39:33.793 --> 39:36.379
SOMETHING IS DIFFERENT WITH
CHRIS.

39:36.413 --> 39:39.724
IT MAKES ME REALLY NERVOUS.
SO I HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT HIS

39:39.758 --> 39:50.068
LOYALTY IS STILL WITH TODRICK
AND I.

39:50.103 --> 39:51.724
HEY, DO YOU THINK WE COULD TALK?

39:51.758 --> 39:53.655
YEAH.
DID YOU WANT TO GO...

39:53.689 --> 39:56.310
THE BATHROOM?
THE BATHROOM?

39:56.344 --> 40:00.517
YEAH, OKAY.
I DON'T KNOW IF SHANNA IS GOING

40:00.551 --> 40:07.689
TO PULL CYNTHIA DOWN.
BUT IF SHE DOES, I NEED TO KNOW,

40:07.724 --> 40:10.655
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE SWING VOTE.
UH-HUH.

40:10.689 --> 40:15.655
THAT YOU VOTE CARSON OUT.
OKAY.

40:15.689 --> 40:21.103
YEAH.
YOU GOING TO PUT ME UP?

40:21.137 --> 40:24.275
NO, IF YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE
CARSON OUT, YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE

40:24.310 --> 40:26.896
CARSON OUT, OBVIOUSLY, RIGHT?
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

40:26.931 --> 40:28.137
DOING.
YES, I GET THAT.

40:28.172 --> 40:30.551
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE,
BECAUSE I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

40:30.586 --> 40:34.793
WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE.
BECAUSE FIPUT TODD UP, WE TAKE

40:34.827 --> 40:37.482
ONE OF OUR VOTE AWAY AND THEY
GAIN ONE VOTE BECAUSE CYNTHIA

40:37.517 --> 40:39.689
WILL BE OFF THE BLOCK.
SHE'LL BELIEVE ABLE TO VOTE.

40:39.724 --> 40:41.724
SHE'S NOT GOING TO VOTE CARSON
OUT.

40:41.758 --> 40:44.827
WE TAKE TODD AWAY FROM OUR VOTE.
I JUST NEED TO 100% COMMUNICATE

40:44.862 --> 40:47.551
WITH YOU AND MAKE SURE THAT'S
WHAT THE PLAN IS.

40:47.586 --> 40:53.724
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?
EVERYTHING I'VE EVER DONE WA

40:53.758 --> 40:57.344
WAS, YOU KNOW, HONESTLY FOR YOU.
1,000%.

40:57.379 --> 40:59.206
EVERYTHING I'VE EVER DONE WAS
FOR YOU.

40:59.241 --> 41:02.068
AND I'VE BEEN COMPLETELY TRUE TO
YOU.

41:02.103 --> 41:06.206
I NEED TO KNOW WHERE...
LIKE, WHERE THINGS ARE AT.

41:06.241 --> 41:10.206
BECAUSE I'M NOT TRYING TO SEND
TODD HOME.

41:10.241 --> 41:21.448
I'M LOOKING OUT FOR YOU.

41:21.482 --> 41:27.689
BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO VOTE
TODD OUT, ARE YOU?

41:27.724 --> 41:30.655
I'M NOT.

41:30.689 --> 41:33.344
WE HAVE A THING.
WE HAVE AN ALLIANCE.

41:33.379 --> 41:35.862
I'M TRYING TO PLAY THIS GAME
WITH INTEGRITY, AND I'M NOT

41:35.896 --> 41:40.068
GOING TO LIE TO ANYONE'S FACE.
BUT BY NOT SAYING WHAT SHE

41:40.103 --> 41:43.206
WANTED TO HEAR, IT REALLY MAKES
ME WORRIED THAT SHE'S GOING TO

41:43.241 --> 41:44.896
PUT ME UP ON THE BLOCK THIS
WEEK.

41:44.931 --> 41:52.241
YOU KNOW I HAVE YOU.
I NEED TO-- YEAH.

41:52.275 --> 41:56.827
I DEFINITELY JUST NEED TO, LIKE,
THINK ABOUT EVERYTHING.

41:56.862 --> 42:08.103
IT'S TOUGH.

42:08.137 --> 42:12.310
Julie: UP NEXT, WILL CHRIS'
BIG PLAN COME BACK TO BITE HIM?

42:12.344 --> 42:15.586
THEN, IT'S TIME TO SEND ANOTHER
CELEBRITY PACKING.

42:15.620 --> 42:18.206
STAY WITH US.

42:31.068 --> 42:34.206
Julie: WELCOME BACK TO

42:34.241 --> 42:37.241
"CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER."
WILL SHANNA USE THE VETO?

42:37.275 --> 42:47.931
AND IF SO, WILL MIESHA BE FORCED
TO TURN ON ONE OF HER OWN?

42:47.965 --> 42:50.137
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?
YEAH.

42:50.172 --> 42:53.310
ARE YOU PLANNING TO TAKE
ANYBODY DOWN?

42:53.344 --> 42:56.241
I WAS THINKING OF TAKING
CYNTHIA.

42:56.275 --> 43:00.827
YEAH.
WHO WOULD YOU REPLACE HER

43:00.862 --> 43:02.379
WITH?
THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO

43:02.413 --> 43:03.862
FIGURE OUT.
YEAH.

43:03.896 --> 43:08.689
I TOLD SHANNA THAT I WOULDN'T
MIND IF SHE TOOK CYNTHIA OFF THE

43:08.724 --> 43:13.241
BLOCK, BUT I MORE I THOUGHT
ABOUT IT, THAT JUST CREATES

43:13.275 --> 43:17.896
UNNECESSARY RISK FOR ME.
MY SAFEST BET HERE IS TO

43:17.931 --> 43:22.206
CONVINCE SHANNA NOT TO USE THE
VETO AND KEEP NOMINATIONS THE

43:22.241 --> 43:23.827
SAME.
THE THING SI HAVE TO PUT SOMEONE

43:23.862 --> 43:26.965
ELSE UP, AND I DON'T KNOW HOW
THAT CHANGES AND EVERYTHING.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.310
YEAH.
YOU KNOW.

43:29.344 --> 43:31.724
UP TO THE TO GO UPSTAIRS?
IN YOUR ROOM?

43:31.758 --> 43:32.827
YEAH.
YEAH.

43:32.862 --> 43:48.931
OKAY.
HEY.

43:48.965 --> 43:53.310
OKAY, SO, I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

43:53.344 --> 43:56.103
FIRST OF ALL, IS THIS ANY
POSSIBILITY THAT YOU DON'T WANT

43:56.137 --> 44:00.275
TO TAKE CYNTHIA DOWN?
I DON'T WANT WHAT TO DO,

44:00.310 --> 44:01.862
MIESHA.
I'M IN A SUPER WEIRD POSITION.

44:01.896 --> 44:05.344
FOR ME, IT'S SO HARD BECAUSE, I
WAS, LIKE, PANICKED IN VETO.

44:05.379 --> 44:09.206
I WAS LIKE, OH, MY GOD.
IF CARSON OR CYNTHIA WINS, AND

44:09.241 --> 44:11.241
THEY PULL THEMSELVES DOWN, I'M
THE NEXT IN LINE.

44:11.275 --> 44:12.965
YOU DEFINITELY WEREN'T MY
TARGET.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.241
YEAH.
I KNOW CARSON'S YOUR TARGET.

44:15.275 --> 44:18.448
I JUST NEED TO, LIKE, THINK OF
ALL THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS, AND I

44:18.482 --> 44:20.413
DID WANT TO SPEAK WITH YOU,
SO...

44:20.448 --> 44:22.758
YEAH.
BUT NO CHANCE YOU'RE PULLING

44:22.793 --> 44:27.275
CARSON DOWN, RIGHT?
UM, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, NOT AT

44:27.310 --> 44:37.827
THE MOMENT, NO.
IF WE WANT CARSON TO GO HOME,

44:37.862 --> 44:41.068
YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST LEAVE
CYNTHIA UP THERE.

44:41.103 --> 44:43.689
THIS IS ABSURD.
NOW MIESHA DOESN'T WANT ME TO

44:43.724 --> 44:46.206
USE THE VETO?
I MEAN, HONESTLY, SHE EXPECTS

44:46.241 --> 44:50.275
EVERYONE IN THIS HOUSE TO BE HER
OBEDIENT LITTLE FOLLOWERS.

44:50.310 --> 44:53.310
I'VE NEVER BEEN A FOLLOWER, AND
I'M NOT GOING TO START BEING ONE

44:53.344 --> 44:56.379
NOW.
I DON'T KNOW.

44:56.413 --> 44:59.206
I TOTALLY GET IT.
I'M GOING TO PLAY MY GAME.

44:59.241 --> 45:02.103
I RESPECT THAT.
ALL RIGHT, THEN I'M-- I'LL

45:02.137 --> 45:04.586
TAKE EVERYTHING YOU SAID AND I'M
GOING TO GO GET READY.

45:04.620 --> 45:23.344
OKAY.

45:40.724 --> 45:58.206
HEY, GUYS.
IT IS TIME FOR THE VETO MEETING

45:58.241 --> 46:02.379
THIS IS THE VETO MEETING.
CARSON AND CYNTHIA HAVE BEEN

46:02.413 --> 46:04.896
NOMINATED FOR EVICTION.
BUT I HAVE THE POWER TO VETO ONE

46:04.931 --> 46:10.517
OF THE NOMINATIONS.
I'VE DECIDED...

46:10.551 --> 46:16.758
TO USE THE POWER OF VETO ON...
CARSON.

46:16.793 --> 46:21.689
<i>[ APPLAUSE ].</i>
I WANT THIS BACK.

46:21.724 --> 46:24.275
IT'S ONLY ON LOAN.
OKAY.

46:24.310 --> 46:30.793
THANKS FOR THE JEWELRY.
MIESHA, I WANT TO RESPECT

46:30.827 --> 46:32.758
YOUR H.O.H.
YOU'RE VERY POWERFUL PLAYER.

46:32.793 --> 46:37.103
IF I EVEN STAND A CHANCE HERE, I
NEED SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO GET

46:37.137 --> 46:42.172
OUT IN THE COMPS WITH ME
MIESHA, SINCE I JUST VETOED ONE

46:42.206 --> 46:45.344
OF YOUR NOMINATIONS FOR EVICTED,
YOU WILL HAVE TO NAME A NEW

46:45.379 --> 46:54.206
HOUSEGUEST AS A REPLACEMENT
NOMINEE

46:54.241 --> 46:57.965
ANY VOLUNTEERS?

46:58.000 --> 47:01.827
JST KIDDING
SORRY, GUYS.

47:01.862 --> 47:11.379
THIS IS TOUGH.
I NOMINATE YOU, TIRK.

47:11.413 --> 47:18.379
CHRIS KIRKPATRICK.
AS YOU ALL KNOW, THIS GAME IS

47:18.413 --> 47:21.310
FULL OF CURVEBALLS.
AND WE MAKE THESE FRIENDSHIPS IN

47:21.344 --> 47:25.689
HERE, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,
WE DO HAVE A GAME TO WIN.

47:25.724 --> 47:29.310
I THINK THAT THIS IS THE
DECISION THAT I AM FORCED TO

47:29.344 --> 47:37.551
PLAY AT THIS TIME.
SO...

47:37.586 --> 47:47.724
THIS VETO MEETING IS
ADJOURNED.

47:47.758 --> 47:53.724
THANK YOU, GOOD LUCK.
WELL, THAT WAS A RELIEF.

47:53.758 --> 47:56.931
ARE I'M TAKEN OFF THE BLOCK FOR
THE SECOND TIME.

47:56.965 --> 48:01.310
AND BONUS, I GET A STATEMENT
NECKLACE ON TOP OF IT ALL.

48:01.344 --> 48:04.068
IT'S LIKE MY LUCKY DAY.
AND I LOOK FANTASTIC IN GOLD.

48:04.103 --> 48:06.000
I MEAN... <i></i>

48:06.034 --> 48:11.413
IT'S OKAY.
I KNOW.

48:11.448 --> 48:13.310
DON'T STRESS.
I KNOW.

48:13.344 --> 48:15.413
DON'T STRESS.
THIS DOESN'T MEAN HE.

48:15.448 --> 48:19.344
I UNDERSTAND IT'S A GAME.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

48:19.379 --> 48:22.862
UNFORTUNATELY, SINCE SHANNA
BLINDSIDED ME, SHE HAS FORCED MY

48:22.896 --> 48:24.482
HAND.
AND BECAUSE RECENTLY CHRIS HAS

48:24.517 --> 48:30.896
GIVEN ME REASONS TO DOUBT HIS
LOYALTY, I HAD TO PUT HIM UP.

48:30.931 --> 48:36.827
BUT IT DOESN'T FEEL GOOD.
YOU GUYS ARE-- YOU KNOW--

48:36.862 --> 48:38.724
I GET IT.
SHE HAS THE HOUSE.

48:38.758 --> 48:41.103
SHE WASN'T GOING TO CHOP YOU
OUT.

48:41.137 --> 48:43.241
I WAS NEXT, TODD.
I KNEW IT WAS A RISK TO USE

48:43.275 --> 48:47.379
THIS VETO, BUT IT FEELS KIND OF
GOOD GOING AGAINST MIESHA'S

48:47.413 --> 48:49.103
PLANS.
SO CHRIS KIRKPATRICK IS

48:49.137 --> 48:50.793
VULNERABLE, AND THAT'S SCARY FOR
ME.

48:50.827 --> 48:54.517
BUT I NEED CARSON TO HELP ME
TAKE DOWN MIESHA'S SIDE.

48:54.551 --> 48:58.344
SO I HAD A PLAN.
NOW I'M ON THE BLOCK.

48:58.379 --> 49:01.206
WHO BACKDOORS THEMSELVES ON
PURPOSE?

49:01.241 --> 49:05.137
I KNEW THE RISK.
BUT MAYBE THIS IS MY DAN MOMENT.

49:05.172 --> 49:11.896
YOU KNOW, THIS COULD BE AMAZING.
I HAVE MADE IT NO SECRET THAT

49:11.931 --> 49:14.551
CHRIS KIRKPATRICK IS NOT MY
FAVORITE PERSON IN THE WORLD,

49:14.586 --> 49:17.413
AND NOW THAT HE'S ON THE BLOCK,
I THINK RIGHT NOW MIGHT BE THE

49:17.448 --> 49:19.275
PERFECT TIME TO TAKE HIM OUT OF
THE GAME.

49:19.310 --> 49:23.103
I'M JUST SORRY THAT YOU'RE
STILL UP THERE.

49:23.137 --> 49:35.344
LIVE ANOTHER WEEK, I LIVE.
IF I DON'T, I GO HOME.

49:35.379 --> 49:47.344
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

49:47.379 --> 49:51.862
YOU OKAY?

49:51.896 --> 49:59.724
THAT WAS TOUGH.
YOU OKAY?

49:59.758 --> 50:10.034
I'M REALLY SORRY, MEISH.

50:10.068 --> 50:12.379
I'M SORRY.
IT'S OKAY.

50:12.413 --> 50:15.482
LIKE, I DON'T HAVE A FIGHTING
CHANCE, TODRICK.

50:15.517 --> 50:17.517
I'M NOT UPSET THAT YOU DID
THAT.

50:17.551 --> 50:21.620
I JUST HOPE THAT YOU AND I CAN
TALK THIS WEEK AND WE CAN, LIKE,

50:21.655 --> 50:24.413
GET BACK TO WHERE WE WERE.
I WANT THAT MORE THAN

50:24.448 --> 50:25.724
ANYTHING.
OF COURSE I DON'T WANT TO WORK

50:25.758 --> 50:29.172
WITH TODRICK OR MIESHA, BUT I'M
PLAYING THIS GAME FOR ME, AND I

50:29.206 --> 50:33.137
WILL SAY AND DO ANYTHING, AS
LONG AS IT HELPS SECURE MY SPOT

50:33.172 --> 50:39.206
IN THE FINALE.
I JUST-- I JUST NEED TO SAY

50:39.241 --> 50:41.379
THIS.
LIKE, YOU TOLD ME, YOU KNOW, AT

50:41.413 --> 50:45.103
THE BEGINNING, "I JUST DON'T
WANT TO BE FIRST OUT."

50:45.137 --> 50:46.448
AND I HONORED THAT.
YEAH.

50:46.482 --> 50:50.758
AND I GET THAT THIS GOES GZ
ON AND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET

50:50.793 --> 50:53.620
MORE COMPETITIVE, OR WHATEVER,
BUT I JUST...

50:53.655 --> 50:56.551
I'M STILL HOPING THAT AT THE
VERY LEAST, LIKE, IF YOU DO WIN

50:56.586 --> 50:59.310
AN H.O.H., THAT YOU STILL HONOR
THAT YOU DON'T PUT ME UP.

50:59.344 --> 51:02.413
YEAH.
IFIES, I WANTED TO WORK WITH

51:02.448 --> 51:03.793
YOU.
I CAN'T-- I'LL BE HONEST WITH

51:03.827 --> 51:07.241
YOU, I DON'T FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN
IS INCLUDED IN WHAT I THOUGHT

51:07.275 --> 51:13.896
WAS OUR ALLIANCE.
I SEE YOU TWO TALKING ALL THE

51:13.931 --> 51:15.103
TIME.
YOU GUYS ARE BEST FRIENDS, AND

51:15.137 --> 51:17.379
THAT'S COOL.
BUT I'M SITTING DOWN HERE GOING

51:17.413 --> 51:18.620
INSANE.
I HAVE NO ONE.

51:18.655 --> 51:22.137
WELL, THEN, TALK TO US.
I JUST DON'T WANT TO FEEL STUPID

51:22.172 --> 51:26.172
AT THE END OF THIS BECAUSE I'VE
BEEN REALLY RIDING FOR YOU.

51:26.206 --> 51:31.827
I TRIED TO PROVE MY LOYALTY
TO YOU, AND I REALLY BELIEVE,

51:31.862 --> 51:35.344
MIESHA, BUT IF CYNTHIA OR CARSON
WON THAT VETO AND TOOK

51:35.379 --> 51:37.793
THEMSELVES DOWN, I FEEL LIKE I
WAS GOING UP NEXT.

51:37.827 --> 51:41.344
I'M IN A POSITION WHERE I HAVE
TO FIGHT FOR MY LIFE.

51:41.379 --> 51:44.310
YOU HAVE TODD, TODRICK, LAMAR,
CHRIS.

51:44.344 --> 51:47.551
IN MY HEAD, I'M LIKE SHE HAS THE
NUMBERS, THERE'S NOTHING I CAN

51:47.586 --> 51:50.275
DO TO PENETRATE THAT.
THAT'S WHY, YOU KNOW, I DID WHAT

51:50.310 --> 51:53.034
I DID.
I GET WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,

51:53.068 --> 51:55.620
THAT YOU WANT TO TRY TO PROPEL
YOURSELF AS FAR AS YOU CAN IN

51:55.655 --> 51:58.827
THE GAME.
BUT THE THING IS, IS NOW THE

51:58.862 --> 52:02.448
LINE HAS BEEN DRAWN.
AND THAT'S HOW I FEEL.

52:02.482 --> 52:05.724
SHANNA, YOU JUST WENT FROM MY
TEAMMATE TO MY OPPONENT.

52:05.758 --> 52:08.931
YOU CAN JUST STEPPED IN THE
OCTAGON WITH ME, AND THE CAGE

52:08.965 --> 52:13.551
DOOR IS ABOUT TO SHUT.
IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN BEAT

52:13.586 --> 52:19.068
ME HEAD ON IN A COMPETITION, OR
CARSON FEELS LIKE HE CAN BEAT ME

52:19.103 --> 52:23.034
HEAD ON IN A COMPETITION, THEN
LET'S GO.

52:23.068 --> 52:25.379
♪ I♪

52:25.413 --> 52:28.310
THIS ORANGE JUICE IS...
EVERYTHING.

52:28.344 --> 52:30.586
THE MOM.
IT'S GOOD?

52:30.620 --> 52:33.517
UH-HUH.
IT'S SO FRESH.

52:33.551 --> 52:35.827
I KNOW THIS HURT, AND I KNOW
YOU'RE BUMMED.

52:35.862 --> 52:39.862
BUMMED.
SHANNA, SHANNA, DO YOU

52:39.896 --> 52:41.793
UNDERSTAND WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
WE WON.

52:41.827 --> 52:45.827
WE JUST WON.
BY THAT ALONE, WE JUST WON.

52:45.862 --> 52:49.172
THE ENTIRE HOUSE JUST FLIPPED.
THE ENTIRE HOUSE REALIZES IT

52:49.206 --> 52:51.137
COULD BE THEM, RIGHT?
YEAH.

52:51.172 --> 52:52.827
THAT'S IT.
YOU'RE OKAY NOW.

52:52.862 --> 52:58.379
YOU JUST HEARD THE
CONVERSATION THEY JUST HAD.

52:58.413 --> 53:02.413
SHE'S LIKE, "YOU JUST DREW THE
LINE IN THE SAND," AND BLAH,

53:02.448 --> 53:08.655
BLAH, BLAH.
AND I'M LIKE BOO-HOO.

53:08.689 --> 53:11.034
LIKE I DIDN'T KNOW DOING THAT.
MAN UP, MAN UP.

53:11.068 --> 53:13.413
I'M FINE.
WE DID.

53:13.448 --> 53:16.965
DON'T LET IT GET TO YOU.
I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS VOTE IS

53:17.000 --> 53:19.137
GOING TO TURN OUT, BUT I WANT
SHANNA TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE

53:19.172 --> 53:22.482
POINT WAS TO FLIP THIS HOUSE.
IF WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING, MIESHA

53:22.517 --> 53:27.068
AND TODRICK WERE GOING TO PICK
EVERYBODY OFF ONE BY ONE.

53:27.103 --> 53:30.758
BUT NOW, THE BALANCE OF POWER
SEEMS TO BE SHIFTING.

53:30.793 --> 53:33.206
AND THAT IS GREAT FOR SHANNA'S
GAME.

53:33.241 --> 53:36.034
RIGHT NOW IS THE HAPPIEST I'VE
BEEN SINCE THAT FIRST COUPLE OF

53:36.068 --> 53:37.206
DAYS IN THE HOUSE.
YEAH.

53:37.241 --> 53:40.551
I'M BACK THERE AGAIN.
BUT I NEED TO KEEP YOU THIS

53:40.586 --> 53:41.862
WEEK.
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

53:41.896 --> 53:44.137
THE BIGGEST THING THAT NEED TO
HAPPEN IS WHOEVER IS STILL HERE,

53:44.172 --> 53:47.344
WE NEED TO WIN H.O.H.
AND THEN ONCE THAT HAPPENS,

53:47.379 --> 53:49.413
THEIR DAYS ARE NUMBERED.

53:49.448 --> 53:55.758
DON'T CRY.
IT'S GAME ON

53:55.793 --> 54:01.241
Julie: UP NEXT, THEY'VE

54:01.275 --> 54:03.793
BEEN LOCKED WAY FOR MORE THAN
TWO WEEKS.

58:57.517 --> 59:03.448
YOU'VE ALREADY MENTIONS, SOME OF

59:03.482 --> 59:06.137
YOU ARE MORE INTERESTED IN
OTHERS IN WHO'S PLAYING IN THE

59:06.172 --> 59:09.275
SUPER BOWL ON SUNDAY.
YES, YES.

59:09.310 --> 59:14.620
Julie: LAMAR, THIS QUESTION
IS FOR YOU.

59:14.655 --> 59:20.413
BETWEEN THE 49ers, THE

59:20.448 --> 59:26.000

Julie: YOU GOT HALF OF IT

59:31.137 --> 59:35.137
RIGHT.
THE RAMS ARE GOING, BUT SO ARE

59:35.172 --> 59:40.586
THE CINCINNATI BENGALS.
THAT HAD TO BE A GREAT GAME!

59:40.620 --> 59:46.793
Julie: YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU ALL HAVE BEEN MISSING.

59:46.827 --> 59:48.551
AND BEFORE I GO, HERE'S ANOTHER
BIG HEADLINE FROM THE OUTSIDE

59:48.586 --> 59:53.482
WORLD.
AFTER WINNING SEVEN SUPER BOWL

59:53.517 --> 59:56.241
RINGS, TOM BRADY HAS OFFICIALLY
RETIRED FROM FOOTBALL.

59:56.275 --> 59:59.793
NO WAY!
THAT'S CRAZY.

59:59.827 --> 1:00:01.482
GOOSEBUMPS.
OH, MY GOD.

1:00:01.517 --> 1:00:09.034
FOOTBALL, YOU SAY.
Julie: THAT'S ALL THE NEWS

1:00:09.068 --> 1:00:11.448
FOR NOW, HOUSEGUESTS.
I'LL BE BACK IN A MOMENT FOR THE

1:00:11.482 --> 1:00:14.241
LIVE VOTE AND EVICTION.
THANK YOU, JULIE.

1:00:14.275 --> 1:00:17.379
Julie: WHEN WE RETURN,
THINGS IN THE HOUSE GET HEATED,

1:00:17.413 --> 1:00:21.482
AND FRIENDSHIPS ARE TESTED.
AND LATER, WHO WILL RISE TO

1:00:21.517 --> 1:00:27.172
POWER AS THE HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD?
STAY WITH US.

1:00:43.137 --> 1:00:46.034
Julie: WELCOME BACK TO
"CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER."

1:00:46.068 --> 1:00:50.310
WITH CHRIS AND CYNTHIA ON THE
BLOCK, CHRIS' FATE COULD BE

1:00:50.344 --> 1:00:53.000
SEALED.
BUT COULD AN UNEXPECTED OUTBURST

1:00:53.034 --> 1:01:00.793
FLIP THE HOUSE AGAIN?
WHO YOU GOING TO VOTE TO

1:01:00.827 --> 1:01:03.034
EVICT?
I DON'T KNOW.

1:01:03.068 --> 1:01:04.655
IF SHE STAYS, THEY'VE GOT THE
HOUSE.

1:01:04.689 --> 1:01:09.517
IF WHO STAYS?
CYNTHIA, THEY GOT THE HOUSE.

1:01:09.551 --> 1:01:12.482
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO PICK HER
TO STAY.

1:01:12.517 --> 1:01:16.655
NO, SHE HUNG TEDDI OUT TO
DRY.

1:01:16.689 --> 1:01:20.482
I'M GOING TO EVICT TODD.
YOU AIN'T OVER THAT?

1:01:20.517 --> 1:01:27.620
NO, THIS IS A DOG-EAT-DOG
GAME.

1:01:32.206 --> 1:01:36.103
TODD, I'M SO CONFUSED.
ARE YOU UPSET WITH ME?

1:01:36.137 --> 1:01:39.000
IT'S JUST HARD FOR ME TO
FORGET.

1:01:39.034 --> 1:01:41.034
I JUST NEED TO WORK IT OUT IN MY
HEAD FIRST.

1:01:41.068 --> 1:01:43.482
WHAT, THAT I DIDN'T VOTE FOR
YOU?

1:01:43.517 --> 1:01:51.034
I TOLD YOU MY REASONINGS.
AND I WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME

1:01:51.068 --> 1:01:54.965
HAD IT BEEN THE OTHER SIDE, HAD
I GIVEN YOU MY WORD.

1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:56.965
IF YOU CAN'T GET PAST IT, DON'T
VOTE FOR ME.

1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:01.172
HE'S A PUNK.
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, IN THE

1:02:01.206 --> 1:02:06.068
STREET, YOU CUT MY THROAT, I CUT
YOURS.

1:02:06.103 --> 1:02:09.310
AND, ALL DUE RESPECT IN THE
STREET, HONOR YOUR WORD.

1:02:09.344 --> 1:02:13.965
AND IF IT TAKES ME OUT, PEACE.
THIS IS NOT PERSONAL.

1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:16.172
I WAS NEVER IN AN ALLIANCE WITH
YOU.

1:02:16.206 --> 1:02:20.482
I NEVER TALKED GAME WITH YOU.
I HAD ALREADY TEAMED UP WITH MY

1:02:20.517 --> 1:02:24.034
PEOPLE, JUST LIKE YOU TEAMED UP
WITH YOURS.

1:02:24.068 --> 1:02:27.206
THAT'S WHY I MADE MY VOTE.
IT WAS NEVER PERSONAL.

1:02:27.241 --> 1:02:30.413
IF YOU'RE STILL IN YOUR
FEELINGS, DO NOT FEEL OBLIGATED

1:02:30.448 --> 1:02:33.275
TO E IN MY FACE IF YOU STILL
FEEL SOME KIND OF WAY.

1:02:33.310 --> 1:02:35.758
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO
DO.

1:02:35.793 --> 1:02:37.724
THAT'S THE TOUGH ONE.
WE GAME FRIEND.

1:02:37.758 --> 1:02:40.103
IF YOU AIN'T WITH ME, DON'T
BE WITH ME.

1:02:40.137 --> 1:02:42.551
IF WE AIN'T GOOD, LET'S NOT BE
GOOD.

1:02:42.586 --> 1:02:46.068
GO WITH YOUR PEOPLE.
GO WITH YOUR PEOPLE.

1:02:46.103 --> 1:02:49.482
I TRIED TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF YOU.
I MADE MY DECISION.

1:02:49.517 --> 1:02:52.068
I DINT OWE YOU ANYTHING AT THAT
POINT.

1:02:52.103 --> 1:02:54.103
DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO.
KEEP YOUR WORD.

1:02:54.137 --> 1:03:01.413
PLEASE VOTE ME OFF.
I DON'T WANT YOUR VOTE.

1:03:01.448 --> 1:03:04.517
I KNOW YOU DON'T, BUT I'M
JUST SAYING.

1:03:04.551 --> 1:03:06.896
CYNTHIA, LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU
HAVE TIME TO TALK.

1:03:06.931 --> 1:03:09.413
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO TALK
ABOUT.

1:03:09.448 --> 1:03:11.137
I DON'T LIKE THE WAY THIS GAME
IS GOING.

1:03:11.172 --> 1:03:13.758
IT IS WHAT IT IS.
WHEN I LEAVE I'M LEAVING WITH MY

1:03:13.793 --> 1:03:16.310
WORD, MY INTEGRITY, AND WITH
SOME CLASS.

1:03:16.344 --> 1:03:22.827
IF I GO, I GO.
SHE'S FINE.

1:03:22.862 --> 1:03:25.068
REALLY?
OF COURSE.

1:03:25.103 --> 1:03:29.413
HE'S GOING TO MAKE FEEL BAD?
THAT'S CRAZY.

1:03:29.448 --> 1:03:31.827
YOU KNOW, AS A MATTER OF FACT--
OH, BOY.

1:03:31.862 --> 1:03:38.793
AND ANOTHER THING...
WHY IS YOUR WORD MORE IMPORTANT

1:03:38.827 --> 1:03:39.724
THAN MINE?
YOU CAN KEEP YOUR WORD WITH YOUR

1:03:39.758 --> 1:03:42.931
PEOPLE, BUT I CAN'T KEEP MINE.
REALLY.

1:03:42.965 --> 1:03:46.137
YOU REALLY WANT TO GO THERE.
THAT WAS SOME

1:03:46.172 --> 1:03:52.655
AND YOU TOOK THAT TO--
ARE THEY FIGHTING?

1:03:52.689 --> 1:03:57.517
DON'T TELL ME WHAT I NEED TO
DO WHEN YOUR ASSIS... I DON'T

1:03:57.551 --> 1:03:59.448
WANT TO HEAR THAT... I'M TELLING
YOU... YOU.

1:03:59.482 --> 1:04:03.758
PERIOD.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S WALK AWAY.

1:04:03.793 --> 1:04:08.689
IT'S FINE.
YOU HAVE DONE EVERYTHING

1:04:08.724 --> 1:04:14.517
BEAUTIFULLY AND GRACEFULLY.
AND THAT REACTION IS ALL ON HIM.

1:04:14.551 --> 1:04:23.586
YOU GOOD?
YOU SAID EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEEDED

1:04:23.620 --> 1:04:25.620
TO SAY.
AND HE'S STILL HOLDING ON

1:04:25.655 --> 1:04:28.689
TO-- I GAVE THAT WOMAN MY WORD?
I DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH TODD.

1:04:28.724 --> 1:04:32.103
I TRIED TO MAKE IT RIGHT SINCE
THEN, BUT HE DOESN'T WANT TO

1:04:32.137 --> 1:04:34.724
MAKE IT RIGHT, DON'T VOTE FOR
ME.

1:04:34.758 --> 1:04:38.655
BUT DON'T GET IN MY FACE AND ACT
LIKE WE'RE GOOD IF WE'RE NOT.

1:04:38.689 --> 1:04:41.482
IF WE'RE NOT GOOD, WE'RE NOT
GOOD.

1:04:41.517 --> 1:04:44.344
I DON'T TAKE THAT BULL.
WHEN I'M SITTING THERE AND

1:04:44.379 --> 1:04:45.931
MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS AND
BEING QUIET ABOUT IT?

1:04:45.965 --> 1:04:48.068
I WAS JUST BEING QUIET ABOUT IT
SITTING THERE.

1:04:48.103 --> 1:04:51.758
AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO GET ALL
UPSET OVER IT?

1:04:51.793 --> 1:04:53.965
SHE CAME AFTER ME.
SHE DIDN'T COME AFTER YOU.

1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:58.034
SHE KEPT COMING FOR-- SHE
ASKED YOU IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM

1:04:58.068 --> 1:04:59.965
WITH HER?
AND I DON'T.

1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:03.068
IT'S NEVER APPROPRIATE TO
COME UP AND GET IN A WOMAN'S

1:05:03.103 --> 1:05:04.482
FACE.
I WASN'T GOING TO DO ANYTHING

1:05:04.517 --> 1:05:07.448
TO HER, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO SIT
THERE AND BE CUSSED OUT AND SIT

1:05:07.482 --> 1:05:10.103
THERE AND TAKE IT.
I DON'T THINK SHE CUSSED YOU

1:05:10.137 --> 1:05:12.586
OUT, BUT...
IN THIS HOUSE, THINGS CAN CHANGE

1:05:12.620 --> 1:05:16.034
ON A DIME.
SO OF COURSE I'M HOPING THAT

1:05:16.068 --> 1:05:17.931
CYNTHIA IS VOTED TO STAY IN THE
HOUSE.

1:05:17.965 --> 1:05:21.793
BUTTA THINT PO, ANYTHING CAN
HAPPEN, UNFORTUNATELY.

1:05:21.827 --> 1:05:28.275
AFTER THAT LITTLE... I WANT
TO FIGHT.

1:05:28.310 --> 1:05:34.068
BECAUSE NOW IT'S PERSONAL.
Julie: WHEN WE RETURN,

1:05:34.103 --> 1:05:38.379
CHRIS OR CYNTHIA?
ONE WILL BE SENT PACKING, THE

1:05:38.413 --> 1:05:42.413
OTHER LIVES TO FIGHT ANOTHER
DAY.

1:05:42.448 --> 1:05:48.586
THE LIVE VOTE AND EVICTION NEXT.
STAY WITH US.

1:06:00.206 --> 1:06:03.448
Julie: WELCOME BACK TO

1:06:03.482 --> 1:06:06.310
"CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER."
CHRIS AND CYNTHIA.

1:06:06.344 --> 1:06:11.172
WILL THE POP STAR HIT THE ROAD
OR WILL THE "REAL HOUSEWIFE" BE

1:06:11.206 --> 1:06:14.068
SHOWN THE FRONT DOOR?
LET'S HEAD TO THE LIVING ROOM

1:06:14.103 --> 1:06:17.241
AND TALK WITH THE TWO NOMINEES.
HELLO ONCE AGAIN, HOUSEGUESTS.

1:06:17.275 --> 1:06:19.758
HI, JULIE!
Julie: THIS TIME, IT'S TIME

1:06:19.793 --> 1:06:24.241
TO GET DOWN TO BUSINESS.
IT'S TIME FOR THE LIVE VOTE AND

1:06:24.275 --> 1:06:28.931
EVICTION.
CHRIS, CYNTHIA, IN JUST MOMENTS,

1:06:28.965 --> 1:06:31.862
YOUR HOUSEMATES WILL CAST THEIR
VOTES TO EVICT LIVE.

1:06:31.896 --> 1:06:34.896
HOWEVER, AS YOU KNOW, BEFORE
THEY DO, YOU EACH HAVE A FINAL

1:06:34.931 --> 1:06:40.310
CHANCE TO SWAY THEIR VOTES WITH
ONE BRIEF STATEMENT.

1:06:40.344 --> 1:06:43.310
CHRIS, YOU'RE UP FIRST.
ALL RIGHT, FIRST OF ALL, I

1:06:43.344 --> 1:06:49.068
WANT TO THANK CBS, GINA, CARRIE
FOR GETTING ME ON HERE.

1:06:49.103 --> 1:06:53.310

1:06:57.413 --> 1:07:00.241
HOUSEGUESTS THIS HAS BEEN AN
AMAZING, AMAZING ROLLER COASTER

1:07:00.275 --> 1:07:02.689
OF A RIDE.
THE GREATEST THINGS ABOUT YOU

1:07:02.724 --> 1:07:06.103
GUYS, THERE WERE HIGHS, BUT WHEN
THERE WERE LOWS YOU GUYS STEPPED

1:07:06.137 --> 1:07:08.655
OUT OF THE GAME AND CAME
TOGETHER AS A FAMILY AND I

1:07:08.689 --> 1:07:09.758
REALLY APPRECIATE YOU GUYS FOR
THAT.

1:07:09.793 --> 1:07:13.482
AND I LOVE ALL YOU GUYS.
WHATEVER HAPPENS, HAPPENS.

1:07:13.517 --> 1:07:16.620
DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.
I CAN'T CAMPAIGN AGAINST THIS

1:07:16.655 --> 1:07:18.724
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN HERE.
SHE'S AMAZING.

1:07:18.758 --> 1:07:21.586

THANK YOU

1:07:24.241 --> 1:07:28.896
- <i>[ APPLAUSE ].</i> .
- CYNTHIA, IT'S YOUR TURN.

1:07:28.931 --> 1:07:33.793
FIRST AND FOREMOST, I JUST
WANT TO THANK GOD FOR MAKING

1:07:33.827 --> 1:07:36.758
THIS EVEN POSSIBLE.
I CAN ONLY PLAY THIS GAME ONE

1:07:36.793 --> 1:07:38.275
WAY.
MY WORD IS EVERYTHING.

1:07:38.310 --> 1:07:41.000
MY LOYALTY IS EVERYTHING IN THIS
GAME.

1:07:41.034 --> 1:07:44.517
I WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO PLAY
THE GAME WITH YOU GUYS, IF YOU

1:07:44.551 --> 1:07:47.724
GUYS CAN RESPECT THAT, I WOULD
APPRECIATE YOUR VOTE.

1:07:47.758 --> 1:07:51.344
IF YOU-- IF THAT DOESN'T MEAN
ANYTHING, THEN IT'S OKAY IF YOU

1:07:51.379 --> 1:07:54.172
DON'T VOTE FOR ME.
I THINK THE CLOSER WE GET TO THE

1:07:54.206 --> 1:08:00.241
FINISH LINE HERE, I THINK
LOYALTY AND OUR WORD IS

1:08:00.275 --> 1:08:02.172
EVERYTHING.
SO I LOVE YOU GUYS.

1:08:02.206 --> 1:08:04.172
THIS HAS BEEN AN AMAZING
EXPERIENCE.

1:08:04.206 --> 1:08:08.137
THANK YOU, CBS.
THANK YOU, EVERYONE.

1:08:08.172 --> 1:08:14.103
SHOUT OUT TO MY HUSBAND, NOEL,

THANK YOU.
Julie: THANK YOU, CYNTHIA.

1:08:17.068 --> 1:08:19.689
THANK YOU, BOTH.
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE, IT'S TIME

1:08:19.724 --> 1:08:24.655
FOR THE LIVE VOTING TO BEGIN.
MIESHA, AS THE CURRENT HEAD OF

1:08:24.689 --> 1:08:27.275
HOUSEHOLD, YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO
VOTE.

1:08:27.310 --> 1:08:30.655
NEITHER ARE THE TWO NOMINEES.

1:08:30.689 --> 1:08:36.034

CAST YOUR VOTE TO EVICT.

1:08:36.068 --> 1:08:40.206
TODRICK, YOU'RE UP FIRST.
PLEASE GO TO THE DIARY ROOM.

1:08:40.241 --> 1:08:45.448
TODRICK HAS SAID THAT HE'S NOT A

1:08:45.482 --> 1:08:51.241
FAN OF CHRIS'.
WILL HE MAKE IT CLEAR WITH HIS

1:08:51.275 --> 1:08:52.172

KIRKPATRICK.
LOVE YOU MOM, CORY.

1:09:00.206 --> 1:09:07.620
Julie: THANK YOU.
TODD'S RELATIONSHIP WITH CYNTHIA

1:09:07.655 --> 1:09:12.241
IS IN QUESTION.
WILL HIS VOTE BE PERSONAL OR

1:09:12.275 --> 1:09:14.724
GAME?
HELLO, TODD.

1:09:14.758 --> 1:09:15.862

Julie: SHANNA IS CLOSE WITH
BOTH NOMINEES.

1:09:26.827 --> 1:09:29.724
THIS HAS BEEN VERY DIFFICULT FOR
HER.

1:09:29.758 --> 1:09:32.206
HI, SHANNA.
HI, JULIE.

1:09:32.241 --> 1:09:33.068

HIS ALLEGIANCE TO CYNTHIA FROM
DAY ONE.

1:10:08.206 --> 1:10:11.862
HE SHOULD VOTE TO KEEP HIS BEST
FRIEND IN THE HOUSE.

1:10:11.896 --> 1:10:13.655
HI, CARSON.

1:10:13.689 --> 1:10:17.275

1:10:42.551 --> 1:10:44.655
HOUSEGUESTS, ALL THE VOTES ARE

1:10:44.689 --> 1:10:47.655
WHEN I REVEAL THE VOTE, THE
EVICTED HOUSEGUEST WILL HAVE

1:10:47.689 --> 1:10:52.344
JUST A FEW MOMENTS TO SAY
GOOD-BYE, GATHER HIS OR HER

1:10:52.379 --> 1:10:57.758
BELONGINGS, AND WALK OUT THE
FRONT DOOR.

1:10:57.793 --> 1:11:05.965
BY A VOTE OF 5-0, CHRIS, YOU ARE
EVICTED FROM THE "BIG BROTHER"

1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:07.068
HOUSE.
ALL RIGHTY.

1:11:07.103 --> 1:11:11.103
FOR SURE.
MY FRIEND.

1:11:11.137 --> 1:11:17.620
YOU'RE THE BEST.
I LOVE YOU.

1:11:17.655 --> 1:11:28.137
BE HAPPY.
BE HAPPY.

1:11:28.172 --> 1:11:30.310
THANKS, GUYS.
I'M GOING TO MISS YOU.

1:11:30.344 --> 1:11:32.586
LATER ON, BRO.
GOOD LUCK, BABY.

1:11:32.620 --> 1:11:40.724
I LOVE YOU.
GOOD-BYE.

1:11:40.758 --> 1:11:43.965
HELLO!
Julie: HELLO!

1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:50.517
WE HAVE TO SECIALLY DISTANCE.
WE'VE GOT A GAME TO PLAY.

1:11:50.551 --> 1:11:53.517
PLAY THIS DAMN GAME.
OKAY, THANK YOU, GUYS.

1:11:53.551 --> 1:11:54.413
YOU'RE WELCOME.
WE LOVE YOU.

1:11:54.448 --> 1:11:57.586
THANK YOU.
IF IT'S NOT APPARENT.

1:11:57.620 --> 1:12:03.517
IF IT'S NOT OBVIOUS, THE MON
WON CURSE.

1:12:03.551 --> 1:12:06.655
WHAT DID I DO TO MYSELF.
IT WAS SO STRESSFUL.

1:12:06.689 --> 1:12:08.793
YOU DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS GOING
TO BE LIKE THIS?

1:12:08.827 --> 1:12:12.172
NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT.
IT FEELS LIKE IT CHANGES EVERY

1:12:12.206 --> 1:12:14.172
SECOND.
ONCE THE MIND IS MADE UP FOR

1:12:14.206 --> 1:12:23.310
ME, IT'S MADE UP.
I WENT WITH THE HOUSE.

1:12:23.344 --> 1:12:30.965
NOW WE NEED--
AAH!

1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:37.724
HE'S MY PERSON.
HE'S YOUR LAMAR.

1:12:37.758 --> 1:12:42.620
Julie: CHRIS, JUST AS YOU
SAT DOWN, YOU SAID 5-0.

1:12:42.655 --> 1:12:44.172
YOU SAID 5-0, WITH A BIG SIGH.
I DID.

1:12:44.206 --> 1:12:45.931
Julie: DID THAT SURPRISE
YOU?

1:12:45.965 --> 1:12:49.620
UM, A LITTLE BIT.
I THINK I'M REALLY SURPRISED

1:12:49.655 --> 1:12:51.275
SHANNA DIDN'T, YOU KNOW, VOTE ME
TO STAY.

1:12:51.310 --> 1:12:53.620
BUT, YOU KNOW, I KNEW I WAS
GETTING VOTED OUT.

1:12:53.655 --> 1:12:56.517
I KIND OF FIGURED.
SO I'M GLAD SHE KIND OF WENT

1:12:56.551 --> 1:12:59.241
WITH THE HOUSE TO KIND OF HELP
HER GAME OUT A LITTLE BIT.

1:12:59.275 --> 1:13:03.137
Julie: DO YOU TAKE RISKS IN
REAL LIFE?

1:13:03.172 --> 1:13:05.000
BECAUSE THAT WAS-- I DON'T KNOW
YOU.

1:13:05.034 --> 1:13:09.827
BUT YOU TOOK A REALLY BIG CHANCE
CONVINCING SHANNA TO USE THE

1:13:09.862 --> 1:13:13.379
POWER OF VETO, KNOWING YOU COULD
THEN BE NOMINATED.

1:13:13.413 --> 1:13:15.862
KNOWING I PROBABLY WOULD BE
NOMINATED.

1:13:15.896 --> 1:13:19.448
Julie: IN YOUR OWN WORDS.
YOU SAID YOU...

1:13:19.482 --> 1:13:20.275
BACKDOORED YOURSELF.

1:13:20.310 --> 1:13:24.034
I DID.
Julie: WHY WOULD YOU TAKE

1:13:24.068 --> 1:13:27.689
THAT HUGE RISK?
I MEAN, IT JUST FELT LIKE

1:13:27.724 --> 1:13:30.620
THERE WAS, LIKE, ONE SIDE OF THE
HOUSE THAT WAS, LIKE,

1:13:30.655 --> 1:13:32.620
CONTROLLING EVERYTHING.
AND EVEN THOUGHIS ON THAT SIDE

1:13:32.655 --> 1:13:36.586
OF THE HOUSE, IT WASN'T FUN.
LIKE, THIS GAME HAS BEEN FUN.

1:13:36.620 --> 1:13:41.103
EVERYBODY IN THERE IS AMAZING.
YOU KNOW, WALKING IN AND SEEING

1:13:41.137 --> 1:13:44.137
THE DIFFERENT CELEBRITIES THAT
ARE IN THERE AND GETTING TO KNOW

1:13:44.172 --> 1:13:45.862
THEM, GETTING TO HEAR THEIR
STORIES.

1:13:45.896 --> 1:13:49.172
EVERYBODY HAD GREAT STORIES.
AND I KNEW IF THAT HAPPENED,

1:13:49.206 --> 1:13:52.137
THEN EVENTUALLY, WE'D JUST BE
SITTING DUCKS AND GET PICKED OFF

1:13:52.172 --> 1:13:54.482
AS WE WENT.
SO, YOU KNOW, I WANTED TO TAKE A

1:13:54.517 --> 1:13:57.620
CHANCE AND SHAKE IT UP, KNOWING
THAT IT'S PROBABLY MY GAME I'M

1:13:57.655 --> 1:14:00.137
THROWING TO THE WIND, WHICH I
DID.

1:14:00.172 --> 1:14:02.482
BUT IT WAS FUN.
AND I WENT OUT SWINGING, AND I

1:14:02.517 --> 1:14:04.620
HAD A GREAT TIME.
Julie: SO IT SOUNDS LIKE

1:14:04.655 --> 1:14:07.379
YOU DON'T REGRET DOING THAT.
I DON'T REGRET IT AT ALL, NO.

1:14:07.413 --> 1:14:13.344
Julie: A CRITICAL MOMENT
WAS PROBABLY WHEN MIESHA WANTED

1:14:13.379 --> 1:14:15.896
TO GUARANTEE THAT YOU WERE WITH
HER.

1:14:15.931 --> 1:14:18.620
UH-HUH.
Julie: AND YOU DIDN'T TELL

1:14:18.655 --> 1:14:21.034
HER WHAT SHE WANTED TO HEAR.
WHY NOT?

1:14:21.068 --> 1:14:24.000
BECAUSE I FELT LIKE THE
CONNECTION THAT I HAD WITH

1:14:24.034 --> 1:14:27.275
MIESHA, I COULDN'T LIE TO HER.
YOU KNOW, I COULDN'T SAY WHAT

1:14:27.310 --> 1:14:31.448
SHE WANTED ME TO SAY, SO BY
SAYING WHAT I SAID, I KIND OF

1:14:31.482 --> 1:14:35.034
TOLD HER WHERE I WAS AT.
AND I THINK SHE KNEW AT THAT

1:14:35.068 --> 1:14:36.655
POINT.
AND THAT'S WHEN, YOU KNOW, I

1:14:36.689 --> 1:14:41.586
KNEW THAT, YOU KNOW, THEY WERE
STACKED AGAINST ME, AND THIS WAS

1:14:41.620 --> 1:14:46.620
A BAD BUT FUN, YOU KNOW, SHAKE
UP THE HOUSE KIND OF MOVE.

1:14:46.655 --> 1:14:50.448
EVERYBODY ON THAT SIDE OF THE
HOUSE DIDN'T FEEL LIKE THEY WERE

1:14:50.482 --> 1:14:51.862
PLAYING.
THEY WERE KIND OF ROAMING

1:14:51.896 --> 1:14:53.137
AROUND.
I WAS LIKE LET'S PLAY.

1:14:53.172 --> 1:14:55.068
LET'S HAVE FUN.
Julie: YOU SAID IT WAS

1:14:55.103 --> 1:14:57.482
IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO PLAY THIS
GAME WITH INTEGRITY.

1:14:57.517 --> 1:14:59.448
I KNOW.
Julie: THIS IS THM "BIG

1:14:59.482 --> 1:15:01.862
BROTHER" HOUSE WHERE YOU KNOW
YOU CAN BOUNCE CHECKS.

1:15:01.896 --> 1:15:03.275
YEAH.
Julie: SO WHY WAS IT SO

1:15:03.310 --> 1:15:05.034
IMPORTANT TO YOU TO PLAY WITH
INTEGRITY?

1:15:05.068 --> 1:15:08.206
WELL, I MEAN, I HOPE IT SHOWS
I DID.

1:15:08.241 --> 1:15:11.517
THERE WERE SOME SOMETIMES WHERE,
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WOULD SAY

1:15:11.551 --> 1:15:14.896
SOMETHING OR LIKE, "HEY, YOU
SAID THIS AND YOU FLIPPED THE

1:15:14.931 --> 1:15:16.448
HOUSE.
I THOUGHT WE WERE TOGETHER."

1:15:16.482 --> 1:15:21.517
AND IT WASN'T ABOUT THAT.
I SAID WE COULD GO AS FAR AS WE

1:15:21.551 --> 1:15:23.241
COULD TOGETHER, AND I FELT LIKE
IN ORDER FOR THAT TO HAPPEN WE

1:15:23.275 --> 1:15:26.793
HAD TO FLIP THE HOUSE TO KEEP
THE NUMBERS YOU KNOW KIND OF IN

1:15:26.827 --> 1:15:30.034
THE MIDDLE IN THE FAVOR OF WHAT
IT WAS, AND AND THEN FAIR GAME

1:15:30.068 --> 1:15:32.517
FROM THERE.
I HOPE I REALLY PLAYED IT WITH

1:15:32.551 --> 1:15:35.068
INTEGRITY.
I HOPE I DIDDERING I WAS GOING

1:15:35.103 --> 1:15:38.551
TO DO COMING INTO THIS.
I AM SUCH A HUGE-- RIGHT NOW,

1:15:38.586 --> 1:15:40.620
SITTING HERE WITH YOU IS
SURREAL.

1:15:40.655 --> 1:15:44.241
AND I'M NERVOUS FREAKING OUT AND
HOPING I WOULDN'T BE DOING THIS,

1:15:44.275 --> 1:15:50.068
BUT I AM AND IT'S AWESOME.
AND I CAME TO DO WHAT I CAME TO

1:15:50.103 --> 1:15:52.793
DO.
Julie: HOW WOULD YOU ASSESS

1:15:52.827 --> 1:15:54.896
HOW CHRIS KIRKPATRICK PLAYED
"CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER."

1:15:54.931 --> 1:15:59.000
PROBABLY AS SOMEONE THAT GOES
OUT FIRST FOR NO REASON AT ALL.

1:15:59.034 --> 1:16:02.413
LIKE, THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH-- YOU
KNOW, MY GAME PLAN WAS TO COME

1:16:02.448 --> 1:16:05.827
IN AND ENJOY IT, AND I GOT INTO
AN ALLIANCE WHICH I WANTED.

1:16:05.862 --> 1:16:10.793
THEY TRUSTED ME, I TRUSTED THEM.
AND I SAID WE'D TRUST EACH OTHER

1:16:10.827 --> 1:16:13.310
AS FAR AS WE COULD, AND I KIND
OF WANTED TO HAVE MORE FUN AND

1:16:13.344 --> 1:16:17.551
BLOW IT UP.
Julie: REAL QUICK-- WHAT'S

1:16:17.586 --> 1:16:22.931
MORE GRUELING, GOING ON A WORLD
TOUR WITH NSYNC OR PLAYING

1:16:22.965 --> 1:16:25.206
"CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER"?
OH, MY GOD, WHEN YOU ASK

1:16:25.241 --> 1:16:28.310
PEOPLE THIS, IT'S SO EASY.
IT'S SO EASY TO SAY.

1:16:28.344 --> 1:16:32.724
GOING ON A WORLD TOUR IS WAY
EASIER THAN PLAYING "BIG

1:16:32.758 --> 1:16:34.000
BROTHER."
BECAUSE IN "BIG BROTHER," YOU

1:16:34.034 --> 1:16:38.344
HAVE TO WALK ON EGGSHELLS WITH
EVERY SINGLE THING YOU DO,

1:16:38.379 --> 1:16:41.655
THINGS YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT--
WAWBING YOUR DISHES.

1:16:41.689 --> 1:16:42.965
EVERYTHING HAS TO GO THROUGH
YOUR MIND.

1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:45.448
YOU DON'T WANT TO GET TARGETED.
Julie: DO YOU WANT TO HEAR

1:16:45.482 --> 1:16:46.793
YOUR GOOD-BYE MESSAGES?
YES.

1:16:46.827 --> 1:16:48.931
Julie: RIGHT HERE.
CHRIS, I HAVE SO MUCH RESPECT

1:16:48.965 --> 1:16:52.275
FOR YOU AND HOW YOU PLAYED THE
GAME.

1:16:52.310 --> 1:16:56.103
I'M GLAD THAT WE WERE ABLE TO
FORM A LASTING FRIENDSHIP BEYOND

1:16:56.137 --> 1:17:02.620
OF WALLS OF THIS HOUSE.
COU CHRIS, I CAN'T BELIEVE IE

1:17:02.655 --> 1:17:05.448
TO SAY BYE, BYE, BYE.
I KNEW THAT WAS COMING.

1:17:05.482 --> 1:17:08.034
I'M GOING TO COME TO
NASHVILLE.

1:17:08.068 --> 1:17:10.689
WE'RE GOING TO GET HOT CHICKEN
AND I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

1:17:10.724 --> 1:17:12.965
HI, CHRIS.
I ADORE YOU.

1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:17.896
YOU MADE THIS HOUSE SO MUCH FUN
TO BE IN, AND I CANNOT WAIT TO

1:17:17.931 --> 1:17:19.758
HANG WITH YOU OUTSIDE OF THIS
HOUSE.

1:17:19.793 --> 1:17:24.275
CHRIS, WHAT I CAN SAY?
THIS IS NOT WHAT WE HAD PLANNED.

1:17:24.310 --> 1:17:29.034
WE TOOK A SHOT AND WE MISSED.
BUT I CANNOT IMAGINE HAVING

1:17:29.068 --> 1:17:32.586
ANYONE ELSE BUT YOU TO HAVE
PLAYED THIS GAME WITH YOU.

1:17:32.620 --> 1:17:35.206
YOU ARE AN INCREDIBLE MAN,
AMAZING FATHER AND HUSBAND.

1:17:35.241 --> 1:17:38.344
AND I KNOW THAT WE ARE GOING TO
HAVE THE BEST TIME IN NASHVILLE

1:17:38.379 --> 1:17:41.034
HANGING OUT.
CHRIS KIRKPATRICK, I FOUGHT

1:17:41.068 --> 1:17:44.862
FOR YOU EVERY SINGLE WEEK.
I NEVER TURNED MY BACK ON.

1:17:44.896 --> 1:17:47.862
YOU.
I DON'T KNOW AT WHAT POINT YOU

1:17:47.896 --> 1:17:51.689
DECIDED TO GO TO A SMEAR
CAMPAIGN AGAINST ME, BUT I MADE

1:17:51.724 --> 1:17:56.655
IT MY SOLE MISSION TO MAKE SURE
I LASTED LONGENER THIS HOUSE

1:17:56.689 --> 1:18:00.241
THAN YOU DID.
WHOOPS, THERE IT IS.

1:18:00.275 --> 1:18:01.344
BYE, BYE, CHRIS KIRKPATRICK.
RESPECT.

1:18:01.379 --> 1:18:02.793
Julie: WHY DO YOU SAY
RESPECT?

1:18:02.827 --> 1:18:04.758
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF WHAT YOU
JUST HEARD FROM TODRICK.

1:18:04.793 --> 1:18:07.862
I UNDERSTAND WHY HE THOUGHT
THAT I WENT AGAINST HIM.

1:18:07.896 --> 1:18:11.206
BUT IN MY HEAD I WASN'T, YOU
KNOW, BREAKING THAT DEAL.

1:18:11.241 --> 1:18:12.620
I WASN'T TURNING PEOPLE AGAINST
HIM.

1:18:12.655 --> 1:18:15.655
AND THEN I HEARD HE WAS TURNED
AGAINST ME, AND MY BIGGEST

1:18:15.689 --> 1:18:19.000
MISTAKE WAS LISTENING TO PEOPLE
RATHER THAN GOING RIGHT TO

1:18:19.034 --> 1:18:22.068
TODRICK AND SAYING, "LISTEN, ARE
YOU, YOU KNOW, THROWING MY NAME

1:18:22.103 --> 1:18:24.068
OUT THERE?"
BECAUSE I THOUGHT IF I DO, HE'S

1:18:24.103 --> 1:18:27.793
GOING TO SAY HE'S NOT ANYWAY.
SO, YOU KNOW, IT IS-- IT IS WHAT

1:18:27.827 --> 1:18:31.034
IT IS.
I LOVE TODRICK.

1:18:31.068 --> 1:18:33.862
YOU KNOW, HE'S A GREAT GUY.
AND I WISH HIM LUCK.

1:18:33.896 --> 1:18:37.413
Julie: YOUR FRIEND, LANCE
BASS IS A BIG FAN.

1:18:37.448 --> 1:18:39.551
BIG FAN.
Julie: WHAT IS HE GOING TO

1:18:39.586 --> 1:18:42.793
SAY ABOUT YOUR GAME PLAY?
THAT IS SUCKED.

1:18:42.827 --> 1:18:46.172
THAT'S THE FIRST THING.
HE'S GOING TO CHANGE THE NAME OF

1:18:46.206 --> 1:18:47.931
THE BAND TO N-SUCK, BECAUSE OF
MY GAME PLAY.

1:18:47.965 --> 1:18:49.034
RIGHTLY SO.
IT WAS FUN.

1:18:49.068 --> 1:18:52.310
I WANTED TO HAVE FUN.
I WANTED TO DO IT WITH

1:18:52.344 --> 1:18:54.758
INTEGRITY.
