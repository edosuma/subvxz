01:23.835 --> 01:24.919
How's that going?

01:25.003 --> 01:27.172
The mother's bawling
and the uncle's pissed off.

01:27.964 --> 01:28.965
She's not married?

01:29.424 --> 01:31.259
Divorced with four kids.

01:31.342 --> 01:33.344
I guess Father
was helping out.

01:33.970 --> 01:35.096
Helping out?

01:37.849 --> 01:40.018
Hey, Mr. Burke,
they're in back talking to the bishop.

01:40.101 --> 01:42.562
And Father?
We put him in the break room.

01:42.645 --> 01:44.105
Any press?

01:44.189 --> 01:46.274
Some guy from the <i>Citizen</i>
but we sent him away.

01:46.524 --> 01:47.734
None of the big papers.

01:47.817 --> 01:50.111
Let's keep it that way.

01:50.195 --> 01:52.614
Who's that?
Assistant DA.

01:53.656 --> 01:55.658
It's gonna be hard to keep the
papers away from the arraignment.

01:55.909 --> 01:58.203
What arraignment?

02:00.330 --> 02:02.832
You can tell Father Geoghan
it won't be much longer.

02:04.083 --> 02:09.923
Now, Sheila, you know what good
work the church does in the community.

02:10.006 --> 02:12.342
But I give you
my personal guarantee

02:12.467 --> 02:14.844
that I'm going to take
Father out of the parish,

02:14.928 --> 02:17.472
and this will never
happen again.

02:18.848 --> 02:21.142
We'll just be
another moment, Paul.

02:22.018 --> 02:23.478
Of course, Father.

02:23.561 --> 02:26.815
Now, Sheila, I'm going
to give you my personal card...

03:04.269 --> 03:07.355
Losing a good reporter
is always tough.

03:08.606 --> 03:10.233
But losing
one of our best...

03:10.733 --> 03:13.403
Well, to put it
as eloquently as I can,

03:13.486 --> 03:14.696
it's a real kick in the ass.

03:15.905 --> 03:18.032
But, Robby here
has known Stewart

03:18.116 --> 03:19.868
longer than most of you
have been alive,

03:19.951 --> 03:22.328
so, I'll hand it off
to him. Robby.

03:22.412 --> 03:25.957
Oh, well, thanks, Ben.
I think.

03:26.124 --> 03:30.128
Although I take issue with your
reference to my seniority,

03:30.962 --> 03:35.091
I will say that Stewart's departure
is especially painful for me

03:35.174 --> 03:37.802
because, uh...
For what, Stewart?

03:38.052 --> 03:39.387
Twenty years now?

03:39.470 --> 03:41.556
Stewart's been more
than willing to part

03:41.639 --> 03:43.057
with his money
at the poker table.

03:44.684 --> 03:47.186
And I've got a kid
in college.

03:47.312 --> 03:49.814
Yeah, but I'm gonna keep playing.
Oh, problem solved.

03:50.899 --> 03:52.317
Godspeed then.

03:53.526 --> 03:58.573
Now, Stewart, I find the
timing of your departure

03:58.656 --> 03:59.657
disconcerting.

04:00.575 --> 04:03.161
The corner office sits empty,

04:03.494 --> 04:05.413
the new editor
arrives on Monday,

04:05.997 --> 04:09.167
so I'm sorry, buddy,
but I gotta ask ya.

04:09.792 --> 04:11.294
What the hell
do you know?

04:28.645 --> 04:30.104
How's the cake?

04:30.188 --> 04:32.357
It's really good.
Are you saving yours?

04:32.440 --> 04:34.317
Nah, it's for Mike.
I can never eat at those things.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.736
They kind of depress me.
I know.

04:36.819 --> 04:38.071
Did you see the numbers
from Washington?

04:38.154 --> 04:40.782
Yeah. Very interesting.
I think so, too.

04:40.865 --> 04:43.242
I'm not asking if the PD's lying,
I know they're lying.

04:43.409 --> 04:45.244
All I'm asking,
who's behind it?

04:46.037 --> 04:48.957
Oh. Okay, I get it.
You don't want to talk.

04:50.083 --> 04:51.584
No, Dan, I'm not mad,
I'm hungry.

04:51.668 --> 04:53.336
I've been talking here
so long I didn't eat lunch.

04:53.419 --> 04:54.796
So I'm gonna go
get something to eat,

04:54.879 --> 04:56.214
and that'll give you
an hour to decide

04:56.297 --> 04:57.632
whether you want to be
on the right side of this

04:57.715 --> 04:59.509
or read about it
like everybody else.

04:59.592 --> 05:00.593
Bye, Dan.

05:00.969 --> 05:02.428
You think
Cahill has something?

05:02.512 --> 05:04.555
Maybe. I just don't think
the story's for us.

05:05.098 --> 05:07.809
Ben likes it. Yeah, it's not bad,
it's just not Spotlight.

05:07.892 --> 05:08.935
What's just not Spotlight?

05:09.060 --> 05:11.260
The PD numbers.
The numbers story. It feels thin.

05:11.896 --> 05:13.982
Oh, you got Cahill to talk?

05:15.817 --> 05:16.901
No, but I will.

05:17.610 --> 05:19.862
Good. Then we'll know
if it's thin.

05:21.906 --> 05:23.491
- How'd it go upstairs?
- Oh, okay.

05:23.574 --> 05:25.994
- Robby gave a good speech.
- Sure he did.

05:26.077 --> 05:27.787
I heard Lubin and Connor
are going to the <i>Times.</i>

05:27.870 --> 05:29.288
- Come on, really?
- Yeah, I heard that.

05:29.372 --> 05:30.373
They're leeching us.

05:30.456 --> 05:32.542
Well, at least they're sending us
a guy from Miami to run things.

05:32.625 --> 05:33.710
That should help.

05:34.085 --> 05:36.045
Has Baron even
spent time in Boston?

05:36.129 --> 05:38.673
I don't think he's ever been here before.
Maybe we should buy him a map.

05:38.840 --> 05:41.160
I have a friend down in Miami
said he cut 15% of the staff.

05:41.259 --> 05:42.593
Great...
Hey, Robby.

05:42.677 --> 05:44.262
New boss coming in
to make some cuts?

05:44.887 --> 05:46.180
I have no idea.

05:46.931 --> 05:48.211
Aren't you sitting down
with him?

05:48.516 --> 05:50.685
Yes, I am.
So is it about Spotlight?

05:50.852 --> 05:53.104
I don't know, Mike,
but I do know

05:53.271 --> 05:55.982
that Ben needs an answer
on the crime numbers story.

05:56.607 --> 05:59.207
I'm telling you,
I really don't think that story's for us.

06:04.699 --> 06:05.867
Mr. Baron.

06:06.743 --> 06:08.411
Walter Robinson. Robby.

06:09.537 --> 06:11.039
Thanks for taking the time
out of your weekend.

06:11.122 --> 06:12.623
Oh, my pleasure.
Appreciate it.

06:13.916 --> 06:14.916
What are you reading?

06:14.959 --> 06:16.169
Uh...

06:16.294 --> 06:17.754
<i>The Curse of the Bambino.</i>

06:17.920 --> 06:19.922
Oh, yeah,
it's a great book.

06:20.256 --> 06:22.383
The <i>Globe</i> has
season tickets at Fenway

06:22.467 --> 06:24.010
once you're settled in,
by the way.

06:24.302 --> 06:25.553
Thank you.

06:25.636 --> 06:28.473
Uh, to be honest,
I'm not much of a baseball fan.

06:28.556 --> 06:31.142
I'm just trying to
get a feel for the city.

06:31.726 --> 06:33.478
Oh, yeah...

06:33.644 --> 06:35.354
So you're originally
from Boston?

06:35.521 --> 06:37.356
I am. Born and raised, yeah.

06:37.523 --> 06:39.609
A lot of the newsroom
is from here.

06:39.776 --> 06:42.987
It really feels like
a local paper in that way.

06:43.488 --> 06:46.657
And did that change at all after
the paper was sold to the <i>Times?</i>

06:48.076 --> 06:50.912
No. No, I don't think
that had a big impact.

06:51.829 --> 06:52.830
Good.

06:54.248 --> 06:57.418
And you're an editor
for the Spotlight team?

06:58.127 --> 07:01.130
I'd prefer to think of myself
as player coach. But yes.

07:01.798 --> 07:03.091
Are you familiar
with Spotlight?

07:04.092 --> 07:05.301
No, not particularly.

07:05.468 --> 07:08.805
Well, we are a four-person
investigative team.

07:09.180 --> 07:11.516
We report to
Ben Bradlee, Jr.,

07:11.599 --> 07:13.684
and we keep
our work confidential.

07:15.645 --> 07:16.854
What're you
working on now?

07:17.313 --> 07:20.441
We just put out a piece on a
shoddy construction outfit,

07:20.525 --> 07:24.195
and right now we're really just
trolling around for our next story.

07:25.029 --> 07:26.364
How long does
that typically take?

07:27.240 --> 07:29.575
Hard to say.
A couple months.

07:30.701 --> 07:31.702
Couple months?

07:32.036 --> 07:34.038
Yeah, we don't like to
rush it.

07:34.372 --> 07:39.377
Once we settle on a project, we can
spend a year or more investigating it.

07:42.213 --> 07:44.715
Is that a concern?
Not necessarily.

07:45.591 --> 07:47.511
Um, but from what I understand
readership is down,

07:47.552 --> 07:50.972
Internet is cutting into
the classified business, and

07:51.556 --> 07:54.142
I think I'm gonna need to
take a hard look at things.

07:55.560 --> 07:58.938
So, do you anticipate
more cuts?

08:00.231 --> 08:03.317
I think it's safe
to assume so,

08:04.235 --> 08:07.321
but what I'm more focused on
right now is finding a way

08:07.488 --> 08:10.950
to make this paper
essential to its readers.

08:12.368 --> 08:14.203
I like to think
it already is.

08:15.496 --> 08:19.500
Fair enough. I just think
that we can do better.

08:31.512 --> 08:33.054
Mr. Bradlee.
Hey.

08:33.139 --> 08:35.265
Saw the PD numbers.
Looks interesting.

08:35.349 --> 08:36.549
Yeah, there's something there.

08:36.601 --> 08:38.811
How long do you need?
Another week.

08:39.895 --> 08:42.148
Where're you going?
10:30.

08:42.481 --> 08:43.732
Since when?

08:43.857 --> 08:46.068
Technically,
I am an editor.

08:46.235 --> 08:47.403
Technically.

08:47.612 --> 08:49.447
Your sit-down with Baron
go that well?

08:49.822 --> 08:52.491
I couldn't get a read on him.
That's a first.

08:52.825 --> 08:55.369
How about you?
Oh, he's a barrel of laughs.

08:57.455 --> 08:59.248
Morning, everyone.
Let's get started.

09:00.291 --> 09:02.043
Do you wanna
say something, Marty?

09:02.585 --> 09:03.753
Uh, sure.

09:05.838 --> 09:06.881
Uh, hello.

09:07.882 --> 09:11.677
As most of you know by now,
my name is Marty Baron,

09:12.178 --> 09:15.097
I'm delighted to be here.

09:17.558 --> 09:20.811
Um, if you could tell me your name
as we go around, that'd be helpful.

09:20.895 --> 09:22.230
Thank you.

09:23.522 --> 09:25.524
Okay. Peter?

09:25.733 --> 09:27.235
Peter Canellos, Metro.

09:27.944 --> 09:30.029
I've got a major
Big Dig closure.

09:32.323 --> 09:34.492
Hey, Steve. Hey.
Mike.

09:35.576 --> 09:36.994
Crappy game
last night, huh?

09:37.495 --> 09:39.038
Yeah, they can't hit
worth a nickel.

09:39.205 --> 09:42.625
Hey listen, what's Eileen McNamara
doing in the 10:30?

09:43.960 --> 09:46.128
Do you need something, Mike?
No, just curious.

09:46.671 --> 09:48.547
Go be curious somewhere else.
I got work to do, huh?

09:48.714 --> 09:49.924
Okay, Steve.

09:50.007 --> 09:51.425
See you.
Yeah.

09:51.968 --> 09:54.553
And it looks like Pedro's gonna
be out until September 1st.

09:54.637 --> 09:57.348
Jimmy says he'll be back this year,
but the doc didn't seem so sure.

09:57.848 --> 09:58.975
When's the Pats' opener?

10:03.062 --> 10:05.314
Is that everyone?

10:05.439 --> 10:07.441
Yes, that's it.
Okay. Good.

10:07.692 --> 10:09.193
Thank you. Uh...

10:09.568 --> 10:13.406
Did everyone read
Eileen McNamara's column this weekend?

10:14.407 --> 10:15.700
That's the Geoghan case?

10:15.783 --> 10:17.702
Yeah, what's the folo
on that?

10:18.536 --> 10:21.622
It's a column, what kind
of folo were you thinking?

10:22.415 --> 10:25.501
Uh, well, apparently
this priest molested kids

10:25.584 --> 10:27.545
in six different parishes
over the last 30 years,

10:27.712 --> 10:30.006
and the attorney
for the victims, Mr...

10:30.339 --> 10:32.216
Garabedian.
Thanks, Eileen.

10:32.383 --> 10:34.468
Mr. Garabedian says
Cardinal Law found out

10:34.552 --> 10:36.345
about it 15 years ago
and did nothing.

10:36.429 --> 10:38.014
Yeah, I think that
attorney's a bit of a crank,

10:38.097 --> 10:39.598
and the church
dismissed the claim.

10:39.724 --> 10:40.850
He said, she said.

10:41.183 --> 10:42.977
Whether Mr. Garabedian
is a crank or not

10:43.144 --> 10:45.479
he says he has documents
that prove the cardinal knew.

10:45.855 --> 10:48.065
As I understand it,
those documents are under seal.

10:48.316 --> 10:51.986
Okay, but the fact remains,
a Boston priest abused 80 kids,

10:52.153 --> 10:54.613
we have a lawyer who says he
can prove Law knew about it,

10:54.780 --> 10:58.117
and we've written all of, uh,
two stories in the last six months.

10:59.243 --> 11:02.496
This strikes me as an essential
story to a local paper.

11:02.663 --> 11:06.000
I think at the very least, we have
to go through those documents.

11:06.584 --> 11:07.877
How would you
like to do that?

11:08.878 --> 11:09.879
Oh, uh...

11:10.046 --> 11:11.839
I don't know
what the laws are here,

11:11.922 --> 11:13.758
but in Florida
we would go to court.

11:14.633 --> 11:15.843
You want to sue the church?

11:17.219 --> 11:18.512
Technically we wouldn't
sue the church.

11:18.596 --> 11:21.265
We'd file a motion to lift
the seal on those documents.

11:21.724 --> 11:23.476
The church will read that
as us suing them.

11:24.310 --> 11:25.644
So will everybody else.

11:26.979 --> 11:28.314
Good to know.

11:31.359 --> 11:32.651
Gutsy call
for the first day.

11:32.735 --> 11:33.944
That's one word for it.

11:34.111 --> 11:35.911
How do you think that's
gonna play down front?

11:36.072 --> 11:37.823
I think Gilman's
gonna shit a brick.

11:38.032 --> 11:39.533
Hey.
Door.

11:40.034 --> 11:41.243
How'd it go?

11:41.577 --> 11:45.206
Well, Baron wants to sue for the
sealed docs in the Geoghan case.

11:45.664 --> 11:48.250
Wants to sue the church?
Hey, that's great.

11:48.959 --> 11:51.462
We covered Geoghan when the
story broke three years ago.

11:51.629 --> 11:53.214
Baron was still in Miami.

11:53.297 --> 11:55.257
I think he might have been
at the <i>Times</i> then, actually.

11:55.341 --> 11:56.384
He wasn't here.

11:56.467 --> 11:57.987
So do you think
that suit has a chance?

11:59.178 --> 12:00.679
Depends on the judge.

12:01.138 --> 12:02.973
And what parish he belongs to.

12:04.642 --> 12:06.936
Bradlee. Yeah.

12:07.895 --> 12:08.938
Okay.

12:10.606 --> 12:11.899
Baron wants to talk to us.

12:12.817 --> 12:13.859
Us?

12:14.193 --> 12:15.945
Okay, Jon. Thank you.

12:16.821 --> 12:18.823
Yes. Okay, thanks.

12:20.449 --> 12:23.702
I've set up a meeting for
tomorrow with outside counsel.

12:23.911 --> 12:25.454
Jon Albano?
Yeah.

12:25.621 --> 12:27.123
Who's the judge
in this case?

12:27.748 --> 12:29.125
Um...

12:29.834 --> 12:31.335
Constance Sweeney.

12:31.627 --> 12:33.212
Tough.
Why's that?

12:33.921 --> 12:36.090
Good Catholic girl.
Huh.

12:37.842 --> 12:39.552
So, um,

12:39.635 --> 12:41.762
judging from what I've read,
it doesn't seem like we've done

12:41.846 --> 12:44.723
a very thorough investigation
into the Geoghan case.

12:44.807 --> 12:46.809
Is that right?
No, it's not.

12:47.518 --> 12:48.978
We looked hard at Geoghan.

12:49.145 --> 12:52.148
David Armstrong from Metro,
Michael Paulson for Religion.

12:52.898 --> 12:55.401
Okay, but, uh,
just so I understand,

12:55.568 --> 12:57.903
beyond our daily coverage,
we haven't...

12:58.070 --> 13:00.990
We haven't committed any long-term
investigative resources

13:01.157 --> 13:03.659
to the question of whether or not
Cardinal Law knew about this?

13:05.161 --> 13:06.412
No, we haven't.

13:06.871 --> 13:08.751
And that's the kind of thing
your team would do?

13:08.998 --> 13:10.249
Spotlight? Well, yeah.

13:10.416 --> 13:14.128
But we're still prospecting the
Boston PD story I told you about.

13:15.296 --> 13:16.547
Could you set that aside?

13:16.672 --> 13:17.882
We could.

13:18.215 --> 13:21.802
Marty, in past Spotlight's
had success in large part

13:21.969 --> 13:23.409
because they pick
their own projects.

13:27.183 --> 13:29.185
Would you consider
picking this one?

13:30.060 --> 13:31.604
I don't know if
he's writing about you,

13:31.687 --> 13:33.439
but I will let him know
you called.

13:33.522 --> 13:35.065
Okay, bye.

13:35.149 --> 13:37.234
Hey.
Hey, how'd it go?

13:38.068 --> 13:40.154
Okay. Uh...

13:40.237 --> 13:42.823
Baron wants us to scrub
the Geoghan case.

13:44.742 --> 13:46.285
That's great.
Didn't we cover Geoghan?

13:46.368 --> 13:48.871
Yeah, there's a lawyer alleging
Cardinal Law knew about it.

13:49.079 --> 13:50.719
- Mmm. Mitch Garabedian, right?
- Yeah.

13:50.748 --> 13:51.988
I covered him
at the courthouse.

13:52.416 --> 13:54.296
Can you get to him?
I only interviewed him once.

13:54.335 --> 13:55.669
He's kind of a character.

13:55.753 --> 13:57.046
I like characters.
I'll take him.

13:57.254 --> 13:58.339
Good. You take him.

13:58.422 --> 14:00.382
Also, we should be
talking to, uh,

14:00.549 --> 14:02.343
the lawyer who repped the
victims in the Porter case.

14:02.426 --> 14:03.427
Eric Macleish.
Uh-huh.

14:03.552 --> 14:06.388
That guy was always on TV.
Yeah, the Porter case?

14:06.597 --> 14:09.225
Remind me.
Yeah, um, Father Porter, similar story.

14:09.391 --> 14:11.769
Molested dozens of kids in
Fall River about 10 years ago.

14:11.852 --> 14:13.145
So, we're dropping
the Boston PD?

14:13.229 --> 14:14.355
I vote yes.
No, no.

14:14.438 --> 14:16.357
We just gotta set
it aside for now.

14:16.440 --> 14:18.025
Listen, I don't need
to tell you guys this.

14:18.108 --> 14:19.693
We need to be more
discreet than usual.

14:19.777 --> 14:20.986
All right?

14:21.070 --> 14:23.572
Everybody's gonna be interested in this,
not just the <i>Herald.</i>

14:24.198 --> 14:26.959
We can't let Cardinal Law get wind
of this until we know what we have.

14:28.118 --> 14:29.453
Good luck with that.

14:35.292 --> 14:36.544
<i>So when
do you leave, Nana?</i>

14:36.627 --> 14:39.630
The bus is picking us up in the
church parking lot at 9:00.

14:39.755 --> 14:41.090
We have 40 people going.

14:41.382 --> 14:42.800
And is Father Dominic going?

14:42.967 --> 14:44.802
No, he says
he's unlucky.

14:44.969 --> 14:46.554
But luck has nothing
to do with it.

14:46.804 --> 14:49.473
You know, last time Nana won $160.
Wow.

14:52.434 --> 14:53.602
You gonna tell her?

14:54.812 --> 14:56.355
We don't even know
if there's a story yet.

14:56.438 --> 14:58.983
Well, <i>"Globe</i> sues church"?
It's gonna be a story.

15:18.669 --> 15:21.672
Hey, Lisa. Could you pull all the
relevant clips on that for me?

15:21.839 --> 15:23.340
Yeah.

15:23.507 --> 15:24.925
Is this for Spotlight?

15:25.092 --> 15:26.892
Just drop them off
when they're ready? Thanks.

15:29.847 --> 15:32.141
Excuse me, do you know where
the publisher's office is?

15:33.350 --> 15:34.685
Will do.

15:38.022 --> 15:39.315
How are you, Marty?

15:39.857 --> 15:41.025
Settling in?

15:41.275 --> 15:43.694
Yeah, I think so.
Good.

15:44.320 --> 15:45.362
What can I do for you?

15:46.196 --> 15:47.197
Um...

15:47.948 --> 15:50.701
I'd like to challenge the protective
order in the Geoghan case.

15:51.744 --> 15:53.203
You want to sue
the Catholic Church?

15:53.537 --> 15:54.538
Um...

15:55.205 --> 15:58.042
We're just
filing a motion, but...

15:58.208 --> 15:59.209
Yes.

16:00.044 --> 16:01.211
You think
it's that important?

16:02.171 --> 16:03.756
Yes, I do.

16:04.840 --> 16:07.801
Because obviously the Church
will fight us very hard on this.

16:07.885 --> 16:10.471
Which won't go unnoticed
by our subscriber base.

16:10.554 --> 16:12.222
53% of them are Catholic.

16:12.723 --> 16:14.058
Mmm-hmm.

16:15.100 --> 16:16.727
I think
they'll be interested.

16:20.397 --> 16:21.398
Okay.

16:26.737 --> 16:28.864
Marty, Lake Street
will probably contact you

16:28.947 --> 16:30.032
about a face-to-face
with the Cardinal.

16:30.115 --> 16:31.116
It's customary.

16:31.950 --> 16:35.120
Yeah. They already have.
It's set up for next week.

16:36.622 --> 16:38.290
I wouldn't mention this.

16:49.259 --> 16:50.260
Hello?

16:53.806 --> 16:55.182
Hello?

16:55.265 --> 16:56.517
Can I help you?
Oh, hi.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.160
I'm Mike Rezendes
from <i>The Boston Globe.</i>

16:58.227 --> 16:59.812
I'm here to see
Mitchell Garabedian.

17:00.270 --> 17:02.398
He's on a call.
Please have a seat.

17:03.107 --> 17:04.483
Okay.

17:05.776 --> 17:07.444
All right, I'm listening.
Go ahead.

17:10.446 --> 17:11.448
Okay.

17:12.116 --> 17:14.034
Bill! Where the hell
are those papers?

17:14.159 --> 17:16.078
I asked you to
put 'em on my desk!

17:31.427 --> 17:34.263
The famous Walter Robinson
in my conference room.

17:35.472 --> 17:36.592
Good to see you again, Eric.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.016
Sacha Pfeiffer,
Eric Macleish.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.143
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

17:39.226 --> 17:41.228
You don't play golf,
do you?

17:41.311 --> 17:43.272
Uh, no.
Good.

17:43.355 --> 17:44.690
Your colleague here
took some money off me

17:44.773 --> 17:45.941
at a charity event
last year.

17:46.024 --> 17:49.319
It was a very lucky putt. I actually
had my eyes closed, by the way.

17:49.403 --> 17:50.779
Mmm-hmm.

17:50.863 --> 17:52.698
So, how can I help
you guys?

17:52.906 --> 17:53.907
Uh...

17:53.991 --> 17:56.201
You're familiar
with the Geoghan case?

17:56.493 --> 17:57.578
Sure.

17:57.661 --> 18:00.622
Eighty plaintiffs.
All of them individual cases.

18:00.706 --> 18:02.291
Garabedian must be swimming.

18:02.666 --> 18:06.044
Well. And the allegations
against Cardinal Law?

18:06.837 --> 18:08.380
Yeah, it's tricky. Um...

18:09.548 --> 18:12.134
This is what you need to understand.
These are shitty cases.

18:13.218 --> 18:15.596
The statute of limitations
is only three years,

18:15.679 --> 18:18.807
and most of these victims don't
come forward until long after that.

18:19.308 --> 18:20.768
Oh. Why is that?

18:20.851 --> 18:22.519
Well, they're kids,
you know.

18:22.603 --> 18:24.104
Guilt, shame.

18:24.188 --> 18:25.939
And most of these kids come
from tough neighborhoods.

18:26.023 --> 18:29.026
Nobody wants to admit
this kind of thing.

18:29.318 --> 18:31.403
So, you're screwed
on the time limit.

18:31.487 --> 18:33.113
And, uh,

18:33.197 --> 18:34.865
even if you argue
your way around that

18:34.990 --> 18:38.202
the charitable immunity statute
caps damages at 20 grand.

18:39.536 --> 18:41.914
Twenty grand for
molesting a child?

18:43.081 --> 18:45.834
That is the way
the system is set up. Yes.

18:45.918 --> 18:48.504
The Church is tough.

18:48.587 --> 18:50.964
So, your best shot
is to try these cases

18:51.048 --> 18:54.051
in the press
like I did on Porter.

18:54.176 --> 18:56.178
Hmm. But, you know,
most of the victims,

18:56.261 --> 18:57.930
they don't wanna have
anything to do with TV.

18:58.013 --> 18:59.515
And, uh,

18:59.598 --> 19:03.101
Mitch isn't exactly
a people person.

19:03.727 --> 19:06.313
Yeah, and if Garabedian
can't get his victims

19:06.396 --> 19:08.982
to go before the press,
then he's really...

19:09.066 --> 19:12.152
That's right.
He has a long road ahead of him.

19:12.236 --> 19:15.739
My guess is he doesn't
have anything on Law.

19:16.865 --> 19:18.534
What? You think
he's bluffing or...

19:18.909 --> 19:22.412
I think he's grandstanding
to cut a better deal.

19:23.539 --> 19:24.873
Seems a bit reckless.

19:26.166 --> 19:28.168
Have you met
Mitch Garabedian?

19:28.919 --> 19:33.090
I asked you to write up that motion,
Bill. I didn't ask you to file it.

19:42.933 --> 19:46.228
Hey, Bill, here's
the case files from yesterday.

19:55.946 --> 19:56.947
Hi.

19:58.448 --> 20:00.868
Who are you?
I'm Mike Rezendes from <i>The Boston Globe.</i>

20:00.951 --> 20:02.244
I had an appointment
with you about an hour ago.

20:02.327 --> 20:04.246
I can't talk to you.
I'm very busy. Sharon!

20:04.329 --> 20:06.456
No, no. She went out for coffee.
She said she'd be right back.

20:06.540 --> 20:08.083
I'm following up
on an article.

20:09.084 --> 20:11.086
The one in the <i>Phoenix?</i>
No. In the <i>Globe.</i>

20:11.461 --> 20:12.821
Did you see
the one in the <i>Phoenix?</i>

20:13.297 --> 20:14.897
No, I didn't.
I thought it was very good.

20:14.923 --> 20:16.133
I have a copy here somewhere.

20:16.300 --> 20:17.740
That's all right.
I'll track it down.

20:18.594 --> 20:19.887
I'm actually
following up on a column

20:19.970 --> 20:21.805
that Eileen McNamara
wrote about your suit.

20:21.972 --> 20:24.182
Suits.
There are 84 of them.

20:24.266 --> 20:25.392
It's not a class action.

20:25.517 --> 20:27.997
You should get your facts straight.
No, you're right. I should.

20:28.562 --> 20:30.480
So I'm trying to get some
background information on...

20:30.564 --> 20:32.399
You're not
recording this, are you?

20:33.025 --> 20:34.401
No, I wouldn't do
that without asking.

20:34.484 --> 20:36.820
I can't show you those Church's
documents if that's what you're after.

20:36.904 --> 20:38.071
They're under seal.

20:38.655 --> 20:39.656
Yeah, I know that.

20:40.657 --> 20:41.742
Did you know that
they tried to bring me up

20:41.825 --> 20:44.620
before the Massachusetts Board
of Bar Overseers three times?

20:44.870 --> 20:46.204
They're watching me
very closely.

20:46.288 --> 20:48.916
The Church?
Yeah. The Church. Yeah.

20:48.999 --> 20:51.251
They'd like to get me disbarred.
In fact, put that away.

20:52.461 --> 20:53.795
Put it away.
Sure.

20:53.962 --> 20:55.672
I don't want you recording this
in any way, shape or form.

20:55.797 --> 20:57.674
Not on paper,
not on tape, nothing.

20:57.758 --> 21:00.594
In fact, I probably shouldn't
even be speaking to you. So...

21:00.677 --> 21:02.012
Look, Mr. Garabedian,

21:02.179 --> 21:04.848
I know there's things
you cannot tell me,

21:05.474 --> 21:06.808
but I also know
there's a story here.

21:06.892 --> 21:08.292
And I think
it's an important story.

21:08.685 --> 21:10.145
I already talked
to the <i>Phoenix.</i>

21:10.228 --> 21:11.908
Yeah, and there's a reason
I didn't see it.

21:12.189 --> 21:14.232
Nobody reads
the <i>Phoenix</i> anymore.

21:14.316 --> 21:15.943
They're broke.
They don't have any power.

21:16.193 --> 21:17.527
The <i>Globe</i> does.

21:18.362 --> 21:20.656
If we cover this story,
everybody will hear about it.

21:22.658 --> 21:25.202
The Church thinks
in centuries, Mr. Rezendes.

21:25.535 --> 21:28.121
Do you think your paper has the
resources to take that on?

21:28.455 --> 21:29.706
Yeah, I do.

21:30.457 --> 21:32.834
But if you don't
mind me asking,

21:33.001 --> 21:34.002
do you?

21:35.212 --> 21:38.048
I can't talk to you right now,
Mr. Rezendes, I'm very, very busy.

21:41.677 --> 21:43.679
Sharon? Yeah.
Thank you.

21:43.845 --> 21:46.223
Can I at least talk to some
of your clients? The victims?

21:46.390 --> 21:47.975
I'd really like
to do that.

21:48.892 --> 21:50.352
Call me tomorrow, I gotta think about it.
Thank you.

21:50.435 --> 21:51.436
Thanks.
Yeah, yeah.

22:44.740 --> 22:46.199
I got more clips
from the library.

22:46.283 --> 22:47.743
Leave 'em right there.

22:48.410 --> 22:50.412
Are you guys doing
a story on the Church?

22:50.579 --> 22:52.789
No, we are not doing
a story on the Church.

22:53.915 --> 22:55.917
Matt, you find anything
on this guy, Phil Saviano?

22:56.376 --> 22:57.961
No. Who is he?

22:58.128 --> 22:59.629
He's part of
a victims' organization.

23:00.297 --> 23:02.497
Kurkjian did a story on him
right after the Porter case.

23:02.966 --> 23:04.801
There's a victims'
organization?

23:04.968 --> 23:06.595
Yeah, it's called SNAP.

23:06.678 --> 23:08.805
It's Survivors Network
of those Abused by Priests.

23:09.139 --> 23:10.640
- Crummy acronym.
- Hmm.

23:13.310 --> 23:16.146
You want me to track him down?
Yeah. Bring him in.

23:16.229 --> 23:18.315
How much longer you need
to get through the clips?

23:18.815 --> 23:20.817
I mean, a few days.
There's a lot.

23:20.901 --> 23:22.360
Lisa's still sending up more.
Okay.

23:22.444 --> 23:25.655
Hey, guys. I think I got
another priest.

23:25.864 --> 23:29.743
Liam Barrett.
Molested some kids in Philly

23:30.285 --> 23:31.578
and was moved to Boston.

23:31.661 --> 23:33.914
Did the same thing
and was moved again.

23:33.997 --> 23:35.624
Really?
That sounds like Geoghan.

23:35.791 --> 23:36.917
Is that one of our clips?

23:37.000 --> 23:39.586
Yeah. Byline's
Diego Ribadeneira, 1997.

23:39.669 --> 23:41.509
Must've been back when
he was working Religion.

23:42.339 --> 23:44.758
Was there any folo?
Not much. One short piece.

23:45.675 --> 23:47.886
Huh.
The Church settled the case.

23:50.597 --> 23:52.724
Don't you know
Jim Sullivan?

23:52.808 --> 23:54.851
Yeah. Why?

23:54.935 --> 23:57.104
Looks like the Church
brought him in to help out.

24:05.362 --> 24:06.947
Jesus...

24:07.030 --> 24:09.270
Has anybody but Manny gotten
the ball out of the infield?

24:10.200 --> 24:12.619
Nope. Why do you even
bother with that thing?

24:12.702 --> 24:14.663
It distracts me
from the game.

24:14.746 --> 24:16.581
Know what else
is good for that?

24:16.998 --> 24:19.918
Oh, yeah. Good idea.
My round. I'll be right back.

24:20.252 --> 24:21.503
Anybody want any food?
No.

24:21.586 --> 24:23.171
I'm all set.
Hey, a hot dog.

24:25.632 --> 24:27.092
So you guys
making any progress?

24:27.259 --> 24:30.262
Absolutely. It's a good story.
Why?

24:30.595 --> 24:32.806
Because you're another lapsed
Catholic pissed off at the Church?

24:32.973 --> 24:34.975
We've got a lot of good stuff.
Like what?

24:36.601 --> 24:38.687
I'm just watching the game.
Omertà.

24:39.020 --> 24:41.273
They got another priest,
Liam Barrett.

24:41.356 --> 24:42.566
We reported on him.

24:43.567 --> 24:44.860
I'm just saying, we did.
Okay,

24:44.943 --> 24:47.743
but this guy was shuffled around from
parish to parish every few years,

24:47.821 --> 24:48.989
just like Geoghan
and Porter.

24:49.072 --> 24:50.407
I think there's a pattern.

24:51.366 --> 24:53.743
Sounds thin.
What else you got?

24:54.119 --> 24:57.706
Sacha's got another guy from a
victims' organization, Phil Saviano.

24:57.789 --> 25:00.750
From SNAP? Oh, boy.
We reported on him, too.

25:00.834 --> 25:02.961
I thought you were watching
the game, Steve.

25:03.044 --> 25:04.364
That guy's pretty
banged up, Mike.

25:04.421 --> 25:05.672
We did a couple
stories on him.

25:05.755 --> 25:07.315
That guy would not
stop writing letters.

25:07.382 --> 25:08.717
He wants a holy war.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.093
What? So he's not
worth talking to?

25:10.177 --> 25:11.428
Where are you
on Garabedian?

25:11.511 --> 25:12.721
I'm working on it.

25:12.804 --> 25:14.723
Robby said Macleish
thinks he's bluffing.

25:15.765 --> 25:17.017
I think there's
something there, Ben.

25:17.100 --> 25:19.020
Get me something solid,
or I'm taking you off it.

25:19.352 --> 25:21.646
I don't want us chasing
our tails on this.

25:30.780 --> 25:32.657
Stay away
from that trap.

25:32.824 --> 25:35.064
You couldn't reach that
trap in a million years, partner.

25:35.202 --> 25:37.078
I've reached that trap before.

25:37.245 --> 25:39.122
Yeah? Now Paul, maybe.

25:40.165 --> 25:42.000
- How we doing?
- We're good.

25:42.375 --> 25:43.919
We're two up in the front.

25:44.085 --> 25:45.587
Good.

25:45.754 --> 25:47.074
How's that new editor
working out?

25:47.464 --> 25:49.758
Well, he doesn't
like baseball.

25:49.966 --> 25:52.969
But he seems like
a smart guy.

25:53.678 --> 25:55.055
Yeah, I read an article
about him.

25:55.138 --> 25:58.225
Said he's the first
Jewish editor at the <i>Globe.</i>

25:59.142 --> 26:01.394
Must have been
a slow news day.

26:02.187 --> 26:03.521
He got a family,
this guy?

26:03.688 --> 26:05.941
No. He is not married.

26:06.191 --> 26:08.777
Divorced?
I don't think so, no.

26:09.361 --> 26:12.239
So the new editor of the <i>Globe</i> is an
unmarried man of the Jewish faith

26:12.322 --> 26:14.157
who hates baseball?

26:14.616 --> 26:16.451
Yeah.
Should have given it to Ben.

26:16.993 --> 26:18.411
He's a Bradlee,
for crying out loud.

26:18.495 --> 26:21.122
Didn't raise his hand
fast enough, I guess.

26:22.415 --> 26:23.583
Hey, by the way,

26:23.667 --> 26:25.835
I've been reading about this priest,
Father Barrett.

26:25.919 --> 26:27.337
Said you were
involved with that.

26:27.879 --> 26:30.048
Barrett, yeah. Bad egg.

26:30.674 --> 26:32.274
Lake Street asked
for help, I pitched in.

26:33.677 --> 26:37.347
Victims said Cardinal Law knew about
Barrett when he came from Philly.

26:37.597 --> 26:38.932
Is that true?

26:39.015 --> 26:41.268
You know I can't talk
about the case, Robby.

26:43.353 --> 26:44.354
Off the record?

26:45.230 --> 26:47.232
Off the record
I can't talk about it.

26:47.691 --> 26:49.943
All right.
This related to the lawsuit?

26:50.986 --> 26:52.153
You know about that?

26:53.405 --> 26:54.990
Look,

26:55.490 --> 26:57.742
I don't know this guy Baron
or what his agenda is.

26:57.909 --> 26:59.494
Frankly, I don't care.

27:00.203 --> 27:02.455
I just don't want to see you
taking a bullet for him.

27:03.039 --> 27:04.791
I think you're away.

27:10.171 --> 27:11.798
Put it over here.
Let's go. Let's go.

27:11.965 --> 27:15.802
<i>So the other day
I was on the World Wide Web.</i>

27:15.969 --> 27:18.471
<i>Anything you want to know.
It's right there.</i>

27:19.639 --> 27:21.850
Now, I have to admit
that as a priest,

27:21.975 --> 27:24.144
this makes me
a little nervous.

27:24.769 --> 27:27.355
Should I be worried
about job security?

27:29.190 --> 27:30.400
I don't think so.

27:30.817 --> 27:33.653
<i>You see,
knowledge is one thing,</i>

27:34.029 --> 27:35.822
<i>but faith...</i>

27:35.989 --> 27:37.991
<i>Faith is another.</i>

27:52.964 --> 27:54.299
Hey.

27:54.674 --> 27:55.842
Hey.

27:57.552 --> 27:59.512
Shouldn't you be
golfing or something?

28:00.221 --> 28:02.015
Golfing's not a verb.

28:02.432 --> 28:03.933
And I couldn't get
a tee time.

28:04.434 --> 28:06.353
Is that what they call it?
"Tee time"?

28:06.895 --> 28:09.856
They also call it "a leisure activity."
You ought to try it, Mike.

28:10.023 --> 28:13.026
I do. I run.
Yeah, you run to work.

28:16.404 --> 28:17.530
So why are you here today?

28:18.031 --> 28:20.075
Going over these clips
of Saviano.

28:20.241 --> 28:22.619
Yep, Ben and Steve
think it's a dead end.

28:22.702 --> 28:24.662
They gave me a bunch of
crap about it at the game.

28:24.746 --> 28:26.289
Yeah, Ben emailed me.

28:26.581 --> 28:28.249
He did?
Yeah.

28:29.084 --> 28:30.752
He said we should
let it go.

28:31.461 --> 28:32.629
What do you wanna do?

28:33.380 --> 28:34.881
I wanna bring Saviano in.

28:35.673 --> 28:38.093
So, just ignore those guys?

28:41.262 --> 28:43.807
I think we've got to start
ignoring everybody on this one.

28:44.432 --> 28:45.809
I'm good with that.

28:45.892 --> 28:47.185
Mmm.

28:50.814 --> 28:53.775
Do you think Marty has any idea
what's coming down the pike?

28:54.150 --> 28:56.986
Nope. I don't think
he cares either.

28:57.362 --> 28:58.780
That's refreshing.

28:58.863 --> 29:00.198
Yeah.

29:02.450 --> 29:04.119
Unless he's wrong.

29:22.595 --> 29:25.765
<i>I've always been
fascinated with the newspaper business.</i>

29:26.433 --> 29:28.852
I used to sit in on the lectures
with the Nieman fellows

29:29.018 --> 29:30.437
when I was at Harvard.

29:31.688 --> 29:34.691
I read that you were
an editor once.

29:35.567 --> 29:36.860
Oh, yes.

29:37.402 --> 29:39.654
Yeah, that was
a very long time ago.

29:39.737 --> 29:42.157
The <i>Mississippi Register.</i>

29:42.240 --> 29:45.493
Small, diocesan newspaper.

29:46.369 --> 29:50.957
But for a 30-year-old pastor,
it was a big responsibility.

29:52.083 --> 29:53.334
Too much at times.

29:54.961 --> 29:55.962
How so?

29:57.964 --> 30:00.383
I was close with
the Evers brothers.

30:00.508 --> 30:02.886
We took a stand
on civil rights.

30:02.969 --> 30:05.472
Our readership
was not pleased.

30:06.097 --> 30:08.308
They saw me
as a meddling outsider.

30:09.934 --> 30:11.686
I can imagine.

30:11.895 --> 30:13.521
Tough seat to sit in,

30:13.605 --> 30:15.607
especially in a small town.

30:16.483 --> 30:20.403
I think you'll find that Boston's
still a small town, too, Marty,

30:20.487 --> 30:22.030
in many ways.

30:23.406 --> 30:27.744
But if I can be of any help,
Marty, don't hesitate to ask.

30:28.369 --> 30:31.206
I find that
the city flourishes

30:31.372 --> 30:33.541
when its great institutions
work together.

30:35.251 --> 30:36.503
Thank you.

30:36.586 --> 30:39.839
Personally I'm of the opinion that for
a paper to best perform its function,

30:40.006 --> 30:42.884
it really needs
to stand alone.

30:45.136 --> 30:47.222
Ah. Of course.

30:48.097 --> 30:50.016
But my offer still stands.

30:50.725 --> 30:52.227
Thank you.

30:53.645 --> 30:54.812
Come in.

30:55.438 --> 30:56.689
Ah!

30:58.316 --> 30:59.651
Thank you, Maureen.

31:02.237 --> 31:03.988
A little gift, Marty.

31:05.281 --> 31:09.035
Think of it as a Cardinal's
guide to the city of Boston.

31:26.344 --> 31:28.346
I'm here to see
Sacha Pfeiffer.

31:28.596 --> 31:30.598
Your name?
Phil Saviano.

31:30.765 --> 31:32.517
Okay, just a minute.

31:34.018 --> 31:36.020
So am I the first
survivor you've talked to?

31:36.187 --> 31:37.522
Yeah, Phil.
You are.

31:37.772 --> 31:39.524
Okay, well...

31:40.066 --> 31:43.236
First of all, let me say thank you
for having me in today.

31:44.153 --> 31:45.321
And I want you to know

31:45.405 --> 31:48.449
that you have the full cooperation
of my organization, SNAP.

31:48.533 --> 31:50.451
How many members are in
your organization, Phil?

31:50.868 --> 31:52.829
We had 11 at
our last chapter meeting...

31:52.996 --> 31:55.498
Uh, no, 10.
Karen just moved.

31:56.082 --> 31:57.542
You had a woman
in your group?

31:57.709 --> 31:59.252
Of course there was a woman.
They don't discriminate,

31:59.335 --> 32:00.628
not when it comes to abuse.

32:00.712 --> 32:02.463
And this has nothing
to do with being gay.

32:02.547 --> 32:05.174
What this is, is priests using
the collar to rape kids.

32:05.758 --> 32:07.594
Kids. Boys and girls.

32:14.684 --> 32:16.561
I was 11,

32:16.644 --> 32:19.897
and I was preyed upon by Father
David Holley in Worcester.

32:20.732 --> 32:23.151
And I don't mean prayed for.
I mean preyed upon.

32:25.320 --> 32:26.446
Are any of you Catholic?

32:26.863 --> 32:30.742
I was raised Catholic.
Now I go to my wife's Presbyterian church.

32:31.868 --> 32:33.369
I'm lapsed.

32:33.453 --> 32:35.213
I go to church with
my grandmother sometimes.

32:35.580 --> 32:39.083
It's safe to say we were all
raised Catholic, but now...

32:39.167 --> 32:40.835
Not so much.

32:40.918 --> 32:42.920
Okay. Well,
let me tell you.

32:43.004 --> 32:46.591
When you're a poor kid from a poor
family, religion counts for a lot.

32:46.758 --> 32:49.761
And when a priest pays attention
to you, it's a big deal.

32:50.511 --> 32:51.888
He asks you to collect
the hymnals

32:51.971 --> 32:53.931
or take out the trash,
you feel special.

32:54.140 --> 32:56.184
It's like God
asking for help.

32:56.809 --> 32:59.312
So maybe it's a little weird
when he tells you a dirty joke,

32:59.896 --> 33:03.232
but now you got a secret
together, so you go along.

33:04.108 --> 33:07.111
Then he shows you a porno mag,
and you go along.

33:07.654 --> 33:09.822
And you go along,
and you go along,

33:09.989 --> 33:13.242
until one day he asks you to jerk
him off or give him a blow job.

33:13.326 --> 33:14.869
And so you go along
with that, too,

33:15.036 --> 33:16.704
because you feel trapped,

33:16.788 --> 33:19.207
because he has groomed you.

33:19.957 --> 33:21.793
How do you say
no to God, right?

33:22.502 --> 33:23.586
See,

33:24.712 --> 33:27.048
it is important to understand that
this is not just physical abuse,

33:27.215 --> 33:29.050
it's spiritual abuse, too.

33:29.759 --> 33:33.763
And when a priest does this to you,
he robs you of your faith.

33:34.806 --> 33:36.933
So you reach for
the bottle or the needle.

33:37.433 --> 33:39.560
Or if those don't work,
you jump off a bridge.

33:39.727 --> 33:41.521
That's why we call
ourselves survivors.

33:41.688 --> 33:42.814
Have you read
Jason Berry's book?

33:42.897 --> 33:44.816
He wrote about the Gauthe
case in Louisiana?

33:44.982 --> 33:47.068
Uh, that's "G"...
G-A-U-T-H-E.

33:47.151 --> 33:49.112
Here. And talk to
Richard Sipe.

33:49.195 --> 33:51.572
He worked in one of the
Church's treatment centers.

33:51.656 --> 33:53.574
He's an ex-priest,

33:53.658 --> 33:55.159
married a nun.

33:55.660 --> 33:56.744
Here.

33:57.036 --> 33:58.663
This is his testimony
from the Kos case.

33:58.746 --> 34:00.248
Uh, Phil,
what's a treatment center?

34:00.748 --> 34:02.250
It's where they send priests
when they get caught.

34:02.333 --> 34:03.793
This is all right here
in the box,

34:03.876 --> 34:05.628
I sent this all to you guys
five years ago.

34:06.254 --> 34:09.090
Uh, to the <i>Globe?</i>
Who did you send it to?

34:11.551 --> 34:14.150
I don't wanna say who, but they
said that they weren't interested.

34:14.262 --> 34:16.347
Uh, but Phil, we did run a
couple of stories on you.

34:16.431 --> 34:17.724
I saw them in the clips.

34:17.806 --> 34:20.184
Yeah, but to be completely frank,
it wasn't enough.

34:22.061 --> 34:24.938
You guys gotta understand,

34:25.022 --> 34:26.107
this is big.

34:26.190 --> 34:30.194
This is not just Boston. It's the
whole country. It's the whole world.

34:30.277 --> 34:32.029
And it goes right
up to the Vatican.

34:32.780 --> 34:34.282
Do you have any
proof of that, Phil?

34:34.532 --> 34:37.284
No, not yet. But think about it,
there are so many of them.

34:37.452 --> 34:39.292
How else could they have
hidden it for so long?

34:39.579 --> 34:41.414
So many what?
Priests!

34:42.290 --> 34:43.791
Priests!

34:44.333 --> 34:46.460
I know of 13
right here in Boston.

34:47.170 --> 34:50.214
You know 13 priests in Boston
who have molested children?

34:50.380 --> 34:52.675
Yeah, why do you keep
repeating everything I say?

34:53.301 --> 34:55.261
I just like to
clarify things.

34:55.344 --> 34:56.971
Maybe you should have
clarified it five years ago

34:57.054 --> 34:58.765
when I sent you
all of this stuff!

34:58.848 --> 35:01.017
It's all right here!

35:09.984 --> 35:11.778
May I use your bathroom?

35:11.861 --> 35:13.362
Yeah, sure, Phil.

35:13.446 --> 35:14.822
Come on.

35:21.245 --> 35:23.247
Well, what do you think?

35:24.373 --> 35:26.542
Well, the guy, he's got an agenda,
that's for sure.

35:26.626 --> 35:28.169
You think?
He's obviously been through a lot.

35:28.336 --> 35:30.421
But he's smart, and if he's
right about 13 priests...

35:30.588 --> 35:32.381
Yeah, it might be
a big "if" with this guy.

35:32.465 --> 35:33.841
Do a background check
on him,

35:34.008 --> 35:36.093
and follow up with some of the
other survivors of his group.

35:36.260 --> 35:38.846
I'll track down
this ex-priest, Sipe.

35:38.930 --> 35:40.970
Okay, but stay on Garabedian.
That's more important.

35:41.224 --> 35:43.267
Garabedian,
what a pain in the ass.

35:43.601 --> 35:45.102
You can be a pain
in the ass, Mike.

35:46.312 --> 35:47.313
Mmm.

35:58.783 --> 36:00.827
Mitchell, what a surprise.
How are you?

36:00.910 --> 36:02.870
I'm fine, Mr. Rezendes.
Good.

36:02.954 --> 36:05.373
You know, I haven't heard back from you.
I left you a couple of messages.

36:05.456 --> 36:07.458
I know. I've been very busy.
I don't have time for calls.

36:07.542 --> 36:08.662
Oh, jeez,
I'm sure you don't.

36:08.709 --> 36:11.712
Listen, listen, Mitch, let me
talk to a couple of the victims.

36:11.796 --> 36:13.116
You could sit in
on the interview,

36:13.172 --> 36:14.423
and if you're not happy,
you could kill it.

36:14.507 --> 36:17.387
I spoke to my clients, and they don't
want to be in the press. I'm sorry.

36:17.426 --> 36:20.096
I get that, but I don't need
to name names.

36:20.221 --> 36:21.889
I don't believe you, Mr. Rezendes.
I'm sure you don't.

36:22.056 --> 36:23.558
I don't.
Listen, Mitchell.

36:23.641 --> 36:25.059
Look, Mr. Rezendes,
please...

36:25.184 --> 36:26.602
I'm not writing
a profile here.

36:26.769 --> 36:28.771
I'm working on something bigger.
Bigger?

36:28.938 --> 36:30.231
I don't know
what that means.

36:30.398 --> 36:31.482
I'm not supposed
to tell you this,

36:31.566 --> 36:33.276
but I'm digging around
for Spotlight.

36:35.236 --> 36:36.946
Spotlight's on this?
Yeah, we're looking into it,

36:37.113 --> 36:38.614
but you gotta help me.

36:38.823 --> 36:41.117
You gotta let me talk to some
of these victims, please.

36:44.620 --> 36:45.913
Please.

36:49.166 --> 36:51.002
Come back tomorrow.
9:30 a.m.

36:51.836 --> 36:53.296
Thank you.

37:05.975 --> 37:07.435
Ms. Pfeiffer?
Joe?

37:07.518 --> 37:08.686
Hi.
Oh, shoot.

37:08.769 --> 37:09.854
Oh, that's okay.
Sorry.

37:09.937 --> 37:11.022
No, no problem.
Please sit.

37:11.105 --> 37:12.231
Thank you.

37:12.315 --> 37:13.858
Is this table okay?

37:13.941 --> 37:15.484
This is perfect.

37:15.818 --> 37:17.820
I had a muffin
while I was waiting.

37:18.154 --> 37:19.822
Two, actually.

37:20.323 --> 37:22.950
I eat when I'm nervous.
I do that, too, actually.

37:23.826 --> 37:26.829
I hope I'm not late.
Phil told me 1:00.

37:27.330 --> 37:30.124
No, you're fine.
I got here early.

37:30.333 --> 37:31.542
About an hour.

37:34.128 --> 37:37.298
Um, would you mind if I took some notes?
Would that be all right?

37:42.553 --> 37:44.680
You don't mind
if I take some notes, do you?

37:45.181 --> 37:47.183
- Are you going to use my name?
- No.

37:48.684 --> 37:50.770
Not if you don't
want me to. No.

37:50.853 --> 37:52.897
I just had a kid.

37:52.980 --> 37:55.900
He's only one, but I'm not sure
I want him to know about this.

37:56.359 --> 37:57.610
Sure. I get that.

37:57.693 --> 37:59.987
You can stop this interview
at any time, Patrick.

38:00.321 --> 38:02.031
All right?
Okay.

38:04.909 --> 38:06.369
Go ahead with your notes.

38:06.869 --> 38:08.245
Okay. So, um...

38:10.706 --> 38:12.541
Where'd you live
when it first happened?

38:13.376 --> 38:15.586
In the projects,
over in Hyde Park.

38:16.170 --> 38:17.421
Over by the Stop & Shop?

38:18.339 --> 38:20.174
Yeah, you know it?

38:20.758 --> 38:22.843
Yeah, I drove a cab
for a few years.

38:22.927 --> 38:24.553
Open early.
Bad coffee, right?

38:25.388 --> 38:26.889
Yeah, I guess.

38:28.724 --> 38:30.726
How old were you
when it happened?

38:31.268 --> 38:32.603
I was 12.

38:34.063 --> 38:35.898
Just after my dad
killed himself.

38:36.691 --> 38:37.984
Ah, jeez.

38:38.150 --> 38:39.986
He was a real
piece of shit.

38:40.403 --> 38:42.738
And my mom,
she wasn't so stable either.

38:43.364 --> 38:45.157
How do you mean?
I mean, she was nuts.

38:45.241 --> 38:48.327
She was a schizophrenic.
Same shit.

38:51.080 --> 38:52.540
When did you
first meet Geoghan?

38:53.958 --> 38:56.085
Well, my sister,

38:56.168 --> 38:58.170
she saw him over
in the Dunkin' Donuts.

38:58.754 --> 39:01.549
Tells him about my old man passing,
and he rushed right over.

39:01.757 --> 39:03.092
And there was this nun,
Sister Barbara,

39:03.175 --> 39:05.678
and she ran this group for
kids from troubled families.

39:05.928 --> 39:06.929
Mmm-hmm.

39:07.096 --> 39:08.514
Where was that?

39:08.723 --> 39:11.100
St. Ambrose in Dorchester.
Okay.

39:12.268 --> 39:14.562
She's the one who introduced
me to Father Shanley.

39:16.188 --> 39:17.773
He was a street priest.

39:18.274 --> 39:20.276
Long hair. Very hip.

39:21.777 --> 39:23.738
He invited me to his
apartment in Back Bay.

39:23.904 --> 39:26.115
Where in Back Bay?
Beacon Street.

39:26.907 --> 39:27.992
Beacon. Okay.

39:28.075 --> 39:29.118
Are you from here?

39:30.036 --> 39:32.872
Uh, no. I grew up in Ohio,
but my mom's from Southie.

39:32.955 --> 39:36.250
Okay, so you get it.
I'd never even seen Back Bay.

39:38.044 --> 39:40.629
So what happened
on that first visit, Joe?

39:41.630 --> 39:43.716
Well, he was very nice
at first,

39:43.799 --> 39:45.468
very funny, very casual.

39:46.802 --> 39:48.804
And I think he could tell
I was gay,

39:49.764 --> 39:53.434
so he showed me this mobile he had,
like, over a baby's crib?

39:53.517 --> 39:54.560
Mmm-hmm.

39:54.643 --> 39:56.062
But with different words.

39:56.645 --> 39:59.648
"Homosexual,
transsexual, bisexual."

39:59.732 --> 40:02.568
Okay, and did you know you
were gay at that time, Joe?

40:02.818 --> 40:04.570
Yeah.

40:04.653 --> 40:06.614
But that wasn't information
I was sharing with anybody.

40:06.781 --> 40:08.074
Not in Dorchester.

40:09.325 --> 40:10.701
Okay.

40:10.785 --> 40:13.746
So, what happened after
he showed you the mobile?

40:14.080 --> 40:15.581
Well, I was
a little freaked out.

40:15.664 --> 40:16.791
Mmm-hmm.

40:16.957 --> 40:18.334
I think he could tell,

40:19.668 --> 40:22.838
so he said, "You know what'll
help is if we play strip poker."

40:24.799 --> 40:26.509
Course I lost.

40:27.968 --> 40:29.845
And, uh, things went on
from there.

40:31.180 --> 40:33.182
Can you tell me
specifically what happened?

40:34.975 --> 40:36.602
Specifically, he...

40:37.186 --> 40:38.854
He molested me.

40:42.316 --> 40:45.986
Joe, I think that the language is
going to be so important here.

40:46.445 --> 40:49.657
We can't sanitize this.
Just saying "molest" isn't enough.

40:49.824 --> 40:52.618
People need to know
what actually happened.

40:55.871 --> 40:58.249
We should probably get these to go.
Right.

40:58.541 --> 41:01.877
Geoghan shows up,
and my mom, you know, she's...

41:02.044 --> 41:04.463
She's thrilled.
I mean...

41:04.880 --> 41:06.882
This was like God
showing up, you know?

41:07.133 --> 41:08.467
Sure. Right.

41:08.551 --> 41:09.760
So what happened then?

41:12.888 --> 41:14.306
You really want to
hear this shit?

41:14.890 --> 41:16.559
Yeah. Yeah, Patrick, I do.

41:25.025 --> 41:27.027
He offers to take me
to get ice cream.

41:27.403 --> 41:30.406
And, you know, he's a priest.
I'm a kid, so I go.

41:31.323 --> 41:34.577
Sure.
So we're driving home and he...

41:37.538 --> 41:39.373
He starts patting my leg,

41:41.542 --> 41:43.919
you know, then

41:44.420 --> 41:49.425
his hand just slides right up,
and he grabs my dick.

41:50.259 --> 41:54.722
You know, I just froze up.
I was fucking petrified, I couldn't move.

41:55.931 --> 41:57.933
I didn't know what to do.
I was just a little kid.

42:00.436 --> 42:01.437
Yeah.

42:06.233 --> 42:08.444
You know, I never even
touched my ice cream.

42:08.861 --> 42:10.696
It just melted down my arm.

42:17.620 --> 42:18.954
Did you, um...

42:20.372 --> 42:21.874
Did you see him again
after that?

42:27.922 --> 42:29.089
Yeah.

42:32.635 --> 42:35.137
All right. That's good.
Let's stop there for now.

42:36.305 --> 42:37.473
Sure.

42:37.806 --> 42:40.768
He said it was a way to make me
more comfortable with my body.

42:40.851 --> 42:41.852
Mmm.

42:42.311 --> 42:43.562
So what happened
after that?

42:44.438 --> 42:46.398
Well, he took off his
clothes, and he said,

42:46.482 --> 42:47.942
"I've been so depressed,

42:48.025 --> 42:50.277
"but maybe you can cheer me
up and give me a blow job."

42:50.653 --> 42:52.154
Classy guy.

42:54.323 --> 42:56.033
And did you?
Yeah.

42:57.368 --> 43:00.621
I know what you must be thinking,
like, why would I ever do that

43:00.704 --> 43:03.540
to some creepy guy who's 30
years older than me, but...

43:03.791 --> 43:06.794
What you have to understand is that
this is the first time in my life

43:06.877 --> 43:09.421
that someone told me that it
was okay to be gay. Mmm-hmm.

43:09.505 --> 43:11.507
And it was a priest.
Right.

43:12.841 --> 43:16.011
So you had oral sex.
Did you have intercourse?

43:17.137 --> 43:18.514
Yes.

43:18.597 --> 43:20.182
Not then, but later.

43:21.934 --> 43:24.019
It really
messed me up.

43:25.437 --> 43:28.148
I'm sober now, but that...
That was the beginning of it all.

43:31.068 --> 43:32.820
It's very confusing,
you know,

43:33.946 --> 43:36.240
to be introduced to sex
like that and then...

43:37.074 --> 43:39.076
And then to be
attracted to men, it's...

43:42.830 --> 43:44.873
I'm sorry.
I knew I was gonna do this.

43:44.957 --> 43:46.834
Oh, I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry.

43:46.917 --> 43:48.836
It's okay, Joe.
It's okay.

43:49.003 --> 43:50.963
Of course there is a
church right there.

43:51.588 --> 43:53.173
And a playground.

43:53.924 --> 43:55.926
Joe, did you ever
try and tell anyone?

43:56.468 --> 43:58.304
Like who? A priest?

43:59.722 --> 44:01.682
Can I use your phone?

44:01.765 --> 44:03.267
Yeah, sure.
You know where it is.

44:04.476 --> 44:06.353
You can use my name
if you want.

44:07.313 --> 44:08.814
Thanks, Patrick.

44:09.356 --> 44:11.775
Don't thank me,
just get these assholes, will you?

44:18.240 --> 44:20.242
He's one of the lucky ones.

44:21.368 --> 44:23.454
He's still alive.

44:31.253 --> 44:32.921
Do you want
a cup of tea, Sacha?

44:33.088 --> 44:34.840
I'm okay, Nana. Thanks.
Okay.

44:38.135 --> 44:39.845
<i>Hello.</i>
Hi, Joe, it's Sacha Pfeiffer.

44:40.012 --> 44:43.265
<i>Hi, Sacha. How are you?</i>
I'm good, thanks.

44:43.349 --> 44:46.185
Listen, Joe, I just wanted
to follow up on one thing.

44:46.643 --> 44:48.771
You talked to Phil Saviano
about all of this, right?

44:48.937 --> 44:51.565
<i>Yeah, I did.
I went to a couple of SNAP meetings.</i>

44:51.648 --> 44:54.485
And did Phil ever suggest
you do anything about it?

44:54.735 --> 44:55.819
<i>No.</i>

44:55.903 --> 44:57.446
<i>The meetings
weren't really about that.</i>

44:57.613 --> 44:59.031
<i>I mean, a couple of them
had gone to a lawyer,</i>

44:59.114 --> 45:01.158
<i>but I didn't think
it was worth it.</i>

45:01.325 --> 45:02.451
Why not?

45:02.618 --> 45:04.258
<i>There were just so
many forms to fill out.</i>

45:04.286 --> 45:05.704
<i>It was overwhelming,
you know.</i>

45:05.788 --> 45:08.123
<i>And he said it could only get
me a small settlement, so...</i>

45:08.290 --> 45:10.709
Who, who said that?
<i>The lawyer told me that.</i>

45:11.794 --> 45:14.171
So you did go
and see a lawyer?

45:15.130 --> 45:17.049
<i>Yeah, but I didn't
end up using him,</i>

45:17.132 --> 45:19.009
<i>so I didn't think
it was important.</i>

45:19.176 --> 45:21.261
<i>I'm sorry. I'm not
trying to hide anything.</i>

45:21.428 --> 45:23.013
No, I know, Joe.

45:23.222 --> 45:25.224
Do remember his name?
The lawyer?

45:25.724 --> 45:28.310
<i>No, but maybe Phil
would know.</i>

45:28.519 --> 45:31.021
<i>The guy was on TV a lot
during the Porter case.</i>

45:31.313 --> 45:32.564
<i>He was handsome.</i>

45:32.981 --> 45:34.358
Was it Eric Macleish?

45:34.441 --> 45:36.318
<i>Yeah, that's it. Macleish.</i>

45:36.944 --> 45:38.821
<i>I thought
he was very handsome.</i>

45:41.907 --> 45:43.450
Hey.
Hey.

45:43.534 --> 45:46.537
I was just in the newsroom.
Judge Sweeney set a date for the hearing.

45:47.287 --> 45:48.539
Really? When?

45:48.664 --> 45:49.915
Two weeks, in Springfield.

45:50.624 --> 45:52.626
Canellos started a pool.
Ten bucks to get in.

45:53.168 --> 45:54.968
Anyone picking the <i>Globe?</i>

45:55.170 --> 45:57.589
He's only taking bets on how
fast Sweeney rules against us.

45:59.466 --> 46:01.051
- Robby.
<i>- Hi, it's me.</i>

46:01.218 --> 46:02.553
<i>Did you get my message?</i>
I did.

46:02.719 --> 46:04.888
Looks like Father Shanley
could be our fourth priest.

46:05.055 --> 46:06.390
<i>Yeah, I think he is.</i>

46:06.557 --> 46:08.183
Did you follow up
with Macleish?

46:08.350 --> 46:09.435
<i>I just talked to Phil.</i>

46:09.518 --> 46:11.645
<i>He said Macleish dealt with
a number of these cases.</i>

46:11.728 --> 46:14.273
<i>Guess he forgot to mention that.</i>
Yeah.

46:14.356 --> 46:15.774
I'm gonna go to
the courthouse tomorrow,

46:15.858 --> 46:18.777
see if I can find any cases he
settled against the Church.

46:18.861 --> 46:21.113
<i>All right. Call me
after you do. Good night.</i>

46:21.280 --> 46:22.948
Okay, good night.

46:25.617 --> 46:26.869
Hey.

46:26.952 --> 46:28.287
You wanted to chat?

46:28.454 --> 46:30.456
Yeah, I'm late for a dinner.
You wanna walk me out?

46:30.539 --> 46:31.915
Sure.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.209
Jeez.

46:34.251 --> 46:36.628
Does this guy ever go home?
Apparently not.

46:36.712 --> 46:38.422
I got guys who won't leave
till he does.

46:38.547 --> 46:40.507
He's wearing out the goddamn newsroom.

46:40.716 --> 46:42.092
Where are we on Geoghan?

46:42.342 --> 46:44.178
Following up
on more victims.

46:44.720 --> 46:46.513
Hey, I want to expand
the investigation.

46:46.680 --> 46:48.640
Why?
We got a fourth priest.

46:48.807 --> 46:50.642
There might be
as many as 13.

46:50.809 --> 46:52.311
Thirteen?
Yeah.

46:52.895 --> 46:54.897
Who's your source?
Phil Saviano.

46:55.439 --> 46:58.066
Oh, Jesus Christ, Robby, I told Mike...
I know, I know...

46:58.233 --> 47:00.486
I think Saviano
might be legit, Ben.

47:01.987 --> 47:03.363
You wanna elaborate
on that?

47:03.530 --> 47:05.365
No. Not really.

47:06.074 --> 47:09.077
It just feels like this thing's
stacking up. It's my gut.

47:12.456 --> 47:14.458
Okay.
Okay. Good.

47:14.625 --> 47:15.626
Thank you.

47:25.260 --> 47:26.553
Hello?

47:26.637 --> 47:29.556
<i>Mr. Rezendes?</i>
Uh, yeah. Who's this?

47:29.723 --> 47:31.308
<i>It's Richard Sipe.</i>

47:31.642 --> 47:34.603
Oh, yeah. Hey, Richard, how are you?
<i>I'm good.</i>

47:34.770 --> 47:36.605
Uh, thanks
for calling. Look...

47:36.772 --> 47:38.732
Phil Saviano
gave me your name.

47:38.899 --> 47:40.984
I was wondering if I can
ask you a few questions.

47:41.068 --> 47:43.070
<i>Of course. Yeah.</i>
Great.

47:43.237 --> 47:45.280
So, Phil told me
that you were working

47:45.364 --> 47:48.450
at one of the Church's treatment
centers in Baltimore?

47:48.742 --> 47:51.411
<i>Yes. The Seton
Psychiatric Institute.</i>

47:51.620 --> 47:53.330
<i>It was run by
the Daughters of Charity.</i>

47:53.497 --> 47:56.500
And, uh,
when was that, Richard?

47:57.125 --> 48:01.380
<i>Well, I started my psychotherapy
fellowship there in 1965,</i>

48:02.047 --> 48:03.247
<i>and I was there
for five years,</i>

48:03.298 --> 48:07.469
<i>but I spent the next 30 studying
abusive priests and their victims.</i>

48:07.636 --> 48:08.887
Really?
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

48:08.971 --> 48:11.056
And that's been
your sole focus?

48:11.848 --> 48:12.933
<i>Look, Mike,</i>

48:13.016 --> 48:16.353
<i>the Church wants us to believe
that it's just a few bad apples.</i>

48:16.436 --> 48:18.036
<i>But it's a much
bigger problem than that.</i>

48:18.105 --> 48:19.731
How much bigger, Richard?

48:19.898 --> 48:21.775
<i>Well, based on the research,</i>

48:21.942 --> 48:25.445
<i>I would classify it as a
recognizable psychiatric phenomenon.</i>

48:26.655 --> 48:27.990
That's big.

48:33.537 --> 48:34.913
Hey, Mac.
Hey.

48:34.997 --> 48:37.082
If I wanted historical
data on a priest,

48:37.165 --> 48:38.542
parishes he'd been
assigned to,

48:38.625 --> 48:39.793
where would I find that?

48:39.876 --> 48:42.596
The Geoghan case? It's all in the clips.
Lisa has the source material.

48:42.629 --> 48:44.089
Yeah, what if it was
for another priest?

48:44.172 --> 48:45.591
One that hadn't been
in the papers.

48:45.674 --> 48:47.926
You're looking at another priest?
Who're you looking at?

48:48.844 --> 48:50.137
Any ideas?

48:50.220 --> 48:52.060
Oh, come on, Matt,
you're not going to tell me?

48:53.056 --> 48:54.683
I gotta get to a meeting.
Thanks, Mac.

48:54.766 --> 48:56.101
Hey, Steve.

48:57.436 --> 48:59.479
The archdiocese puts
out an annual directory.

48:59.646 --> 49:01.815
Every priest and parish.
That's great.

49:02.274 --> 49:04.484
Do these go back
any further than '98?

49:04.651 --> 49:06.445
Oh, yeah. Going back to
the '80s in the mez.

49:06.612 --> 49:08.405
Beyond that you gotta
go to the BPL.

49:08.488 --> 49:10.574
In the mez, huh? Thanks, Lisa.
You bet.

49:12.242 --> 49:14.828
He said they all target
the same kind of kid.

49:14.911 --> 49:18.415
Low-income families,
absentee fathers, broken homes.

49:18.498 --> 49:21.585
So a guy like Geoghan goes after
boys not because he prefers them,

49:21.752 --> 49:23.378
but because they have
more shame.

49:23.462 --> 49:24.546
Less likely to talk.

49:26.131 --> 49:28.008
These guys
are predators, Robby.

49:28.091 --> 49:30.385
And I talked to Sipe.
He said he'd seen dozens of them

49:30.469 --> 49:31.845
in the '60s in Seton.

49:32.387 --> 49:33.680
He called it
a "phenomenon."

49:33.764 --> 49:35.557
Why didn't he go public?
He did,

49:35.641 --> 49:37.643
but the Church made a huge
effort to discredit him.

49:37.809 --> 49:41.521
Smear campaigns,
public statements by prominent bishops.

49:41.605 --> 49:44.316
It's just like Saviano said,
and Garabedian.

49:44.483 --> 49:46.026
You getting anywhere
with him?

49:46.193 --> 49:48.570
More victims.
More victims.

49:48.737 --> 49:50.497
You can't empty his pockets?
I'll get to him.

49:50.614 --> 49:52.616
I just need more time.
Oh, come on, Mike.

49:52.824 --> 49:54.660
You gotta get him.
I'll get him, I'll get him.

49:58.288 --> 49:59.790
Jesus. What the hell
is that smell?

49:59.873 --> 50:01.708
There's a dead rat
in the corner.

50:02.501 --> 50:04.294
What have you got?
Church directories.

50:04.461 --> 50:06.505
It's every priest
in Massachusetts.

50:06.588 --> 50:08.173
What parish
they're assigned to.

50:08.256 --> 50:09.257
Are these official?
Yeah.

50:09.341 --> 50:10.425
I figured it could
help us track down

50:10.509 --> 50:12.219
some of the priests
that Saviano mentioned.

50:12.302 --> 50:13.512
Maybe find
some more victims.

50:13.595 --> 50:15.764
Can we turn on some more lights?
I couldn't find the switch.

50:15.889 --> 50:17.929
You wanna borrow my glasses?
No, I'm good. I'm good.

50:17.974 --> 50:22.646
Look, 1983. John Geoghan,
St. Brendan Parish, Dorchester.

50:22.729 --> 50:25.148
So we can find out where any
priest is in any given year?

50:25.232 --> 50:27.484
Yeah, I got him here at...

50:27.943 --> 50:28.944
Huh.

50:29.486 --> 50:30.654
What?

50:30.737 --> 50:33.907
1980, the year Geoghan was pulled from JP.
It says he's on sick leave.

50:33.990 --> 50:35.742
Come on.
It really says that?

50:36.993 --> 50:39.204
Where is, uh, 1991?

50:40.831 --> 50:42.499
Here ya go.
Let me see this.

50:42.582 --> 50:43.834
Barrett. Barrett. Liam.

50:44.042 --> 50:46.420
I can't read that.
Look for a Liam Barrett in there.

50:46.586 --> 50:49.339
1991's the year they pulled
him out of Charlestown.

50:51.842 --> 50:53.427
Barrett, Liam.

50:55.095 --> 50:56.346
Yeah.
"Sick leave."

50:56.930 --> 50:58.682
It's an official designation.

51:00.392 --> 51:02.477
Let's get these upstairs.

51:02.561 --> 51:04.813
And, Matt, check on those
priests Saviano gave us.

51:04.980 --> 51:07.149
- Robby. Yeah.
<i>- Hey, I'm down at the courthouse.</i>

51:07.858 --> 51:10.777
Something's not right here.
Nothing on Shanley either, Sacha.

51:10.986 --> 51:12.487
Okay, thanks.

51:12.654 --> 51:14.334
Yeah, we need to go talk
to Macleish again.

51:14.489 --> 51:17.075
<i>Really, why?</i>
Huh? There's nothing here.

51:17.617 --> 51:19.457
There aren't any records,
I checked every name.

51:24.583 --> 51:26.623
Thanks for waiting. So sorry, guys.
Stuck on a call.

51:26.710 --> 51:28.545
Not a problem.
How are you? Good.

51:28.628 --> 51:30.508
Thanks for meeting us.
You bet. What's up, guys?

51:31.506 --> 51:34.551
Mr. Macleish, are you familiar
with a priest named Paul Shanley?

51:35.260 --> 51:36.845
Yes, I am familiar
with him.

51:38.638 --> 51:40.640
And have you settled cases
against Father Shanley?

51:41.975 --> 51:46.313
As I'm sure you can understand,
I can't discuss that with you.

51:46.897 --> 51:50.442
How about, uh,
Father Ronald Paquin?

51:51.109 --> 51:53.695
Well, I can't discuss that with you either.
Come on, guys.

51:55.572 --> 51:58.116
We understand you've settled several
cases against each of them.

51:58.784 --> 52:01.286
Even if I'd been involved
in those cases,

52:01.369 --> 52:02.954
the settlements
would be confidential,

52:03.121 --> 52:06.082
and I could be disbarred for
acknowledging their existence.

52:06.958 --> 52:08.710
Okay?
Mmm-hmm.

52:09.211 --> 52:11.046
Look, I told you guys,
these are tough cases.

52:12.631 --> 52:15.717
Most of these folks, they
just want some acknowledgment

52:16.301 --> 52:17.552
of what happened.

52:17.677 --> 52:20.013
We got 'em a sit-down with the
bishop and a little dough,

52:20.180 --> 52:21.973
and that's the best
they could hope for.

52:22.557 --> 52:26.353
Well, it's certainly the best
the priests could hope for.

52:27.521 --> 52:30.398
No, the Church promised they'd take
the priests out of circulation.

52:30.732 --> 52:32.901
And did you follow up
on that?

52:38.240 --> 52:39.908
Do you guys
need anything else?

52:40.075 --> 52:42.494
Yes. Why aren't there
any records?

52:42.869 --> 52:43.995
I was down at
the courthouse earlier.

52:44.079 --> 52:46.248
There aren't any records
of any of these settlements.

52:49.459 --> 52:51.253
We dealt directly
with the Church.

52:52.754 --> 52:56.258
We would draw up a demand letter
and send it to the chancery.

52:57.717 --> 52:59.344
You never filed
anything in court?

52:59.636 --> 53:01.221
It's a private mediation.

53:01.388 --> 53:06.101
So, this is just you
and the archdiocese's lawyers

53:06.768 --> 53:07.894
in a room?

53:08.603 --> 53:09.604
Correct.

53:10.272 --> 53:11.273
Anyone else?

53:11.690 --> 53:14.776
Occasionally, the Church would bring in
another defense attorney to help out.

53:15.527 --> 53:16.820
You have names?

53:16.945 --> 53:18.238
Nope.

53:19.030 --> 53:20.282
No, I don't.

53:21.366 --> 53:22.868
So this was all
under the table?

53:22.951 --> 53:24.452
There's no paper trail.
At all.

53:24.953 --> 53:26.955
The victim has to sign
a confidentiality agreement

53:27.038 --> 53:28.164
to get the settlement.

53:28.248 --> 53:30.876
The lawyer takes a third and the
Church sweeps it under the rug.

53:30.959 --> 53:32.544
Jeez,
it's a freakin' racket.

53:32.627 --> 53:34.129
It's more complicated
than that.

53:34.254 --> 53:37.090
Macleish's got a duty to the client
to get the best deal he can.

53:37.257 --> 53:40.176
Sure, but how many victims do
you represent and profit from

53:40.302 --> 53:41.386
before you say something?

53:41.469 --> 53:43.513
Garabedian would say none.

53:43.597 --> 53:45.473
That's why he's taking
these cases to court

53:45.557 --> 53:47.267
because he wants people
to know about this.

53:47.350 --> 53:50.061
I agree.
And legal ethics aside, Ben,

53:50.228 --> 53:52.188
I mean, operating
the way Macleish has

53:52.355 --> 53:54.566
all but guarantees that the
abuse stays under wraps.

53:55.692 --> 53:58.695
Yeah. Did Macleish confirm
all Saviano's priests?

53:58.987 --> 54:03.325
No. He's limited by his
confidentiality agreement.

54:04.159 --> 54:06.578
But clearly he's settled cases
against a number of them.

54:06.661 --> 54:08.330
Phil's put me in touch with
some of the other victims,

54:08.413 --> 54:11.166
I'm pretty confident all of his
priests are gonna check out.

54:12.167 --> 54:13.877
So it is 13 priests?

54:14.044 --> 54:15.712
Yeah.
Looks that way.

54:17.255 --> 54:18.924
Holy shit.

54:21.301 --> 54:23.136
Okay. Keep going.

54:27.015 --> 54:28.850
I'm sorry.
What was the name again?

54:29.601 --> 54:32.729
Uh, Baron.

54:32.854 --> 54:34.814
B-A-R-O-N.

54:35.899 --> 54:38.902
I'm having trouble finding it.
Just give me a second.

54:38.985 --> 54:41.321
It's okay, Kim,
I can vouch for him.

54:41.404 --> 54:44.157
I'm Pete Conley, I'm on the
board of Catholic Charities.

54:44.240 --> 54:45.909
Welcome to Boston,
Mr. Baron.

54:46.534 --> 54:48.703
Thank you.
I appreciate you joining us.

54:49.371 --> 54:51.623
We're very proud of the
work we do here at Boston.

54:52.415 --> 54:54.292
Oh, the Cardinal said
you had a nice visit.

54:55.251 --> 54:56.544
Yes, we did.

54:56.628 --> 54:59.798
He's an extraordinary man.
I'm glad you had a chance to chat.

55:13.853 --> 55:14.896
Enjoying yourself?

55:17.023 --> 55:20.694
Uh, to be honest, these events
aren't really my strong suit.

55:21.319 --> 55:23.780
Yeah. Are you involved
with the charity?

55:23.863 --> 55:26.032
Not directly, no.
Several of my friends are.

55:26.199 --> 55:28.743
We all went to high school.
BC High.

55:28.910 --> 55:31.496
That's the school across
the street from the <i>Globe.</i>

55:31.871 --> 55:33.373
It's hard to miss.
Yeah.

55:34.582 --> 55:36.251
Hard to get away from,
too, apparently.

55:38.628 --> 55:43.216
The Cardinal's in the corner
if you're so inclined.

55:43.675 --> 55:45.343
We've met.
Really?

55:46.219 --> 55:47.887
Did he mention the suit?

55:47.971 --> 55:50.682
No, but he did give me a
copy of the catechism.

55:51.057 --> 55:54.728
Yeah, well, the Cardinal's
not known for his subtlety.

55:54.811 --> 55:56.312
During the Porter investigation,

55:56.479 --> 55:59.315
he'd literally called down the
power of God on the <i>Globe.</i>

56:00.233 --> 56:01.568
How'd that play out?

56:02.736 --> 56:05.572
A week later our editor
broke his leg skiing.

56:06.906 --> 56:08.324
Shrimp toast,
gentlemen?

56:09.159 --> 56:10.952
No, thanks.
No.

56:12.454 --> 56:16.166
You said one of the victims
filed a criminal complaint?

56:16.249 --> 56:17.751
Yeah, there were
a few of them.

56:19.294 --> 56:21.087
But the judge had
the case records sealed

56:21.171 --> 56:23.048
after friends of
the Church complained.

56:23.381 --> 56:25.091
And the Church has
a lot of friends.

56:25.216 --> 56:26.509
Like Eric Macleish?

56:28.053 --> 56:29.387
Yeah.

56:29.471 --> 56:32.557
Let's just say he's not
part of the solution.

56:32.640 --> 56:34.601
You follow what I'm saying?
Sure.

56:35.310 --> 56:36.728
You work hard,
Mr. Rezendes.

56:36.811 --> 56:39.731
Are you married?
Yeah.

56:39.814 --> 56:41.399
Your wife doesn't mind you
working all the time?

56:41.483 --> 56:42.984
Oh, yeah, she does.

56:45.361 --> 56:48.198
That's why I never got married.
I'm too busy.

56:48.907 --> 56:50.492
What I do
is too important.

56:51.284 --> 56:52.494
Hmm.

56:54.996 --> 56:56.316
Your new editor,
he's a Jew right?

56:57.832 --> 56:59.834
Oh, that's right, yeah.
Yeah, see,

57:00.502 --> 57:03.838
he comes in and suddenly everybody's
interested in the Church.

57:03.963 --> 57:05.006
You know why?

57:06.007 --> 57:08.843
Because it takes
an outsider, like me.

57:09.511 --> 57:11.137
I'm Armenian.

57:11.304 --> 57:13.139
How many Armenians
do you know in Boston?

57:14.516 --> 57:16.309
Steve Kurkjian,
works at the <i>Globe.</i>

57:17.227 --> 57:20.146
Oh, that's two.
You should get a prize or something.

57:21.022 --> 57:23.233
What are you, Italian?
No, I'm Portuguese.

57:24.567 --> 57:26.820
From where?
East Boston.

57:28.738 --> 57:30.657
Really? East Boston?

57:32.617 --> 57:34.035
You don't sound like it.

57:40.458 --> 57:43.044
This city, these people,

57:45.046 --> 57:47.132
making the rest of us
feel like we don't belong.

57:47.882 --> 57:49.175
But they're no better
than us.

57:50.176 --> 57:52.011
Look at how they treat
their children.

57:54.305 --> 57:56.224
Mark my words,
Mr. Rezendes,

57:56.307 --> 57:58.476
if it takes a village
to raise a child,

57:58.560 --> 58:00.061
it takes a village
to abuse one.

58:04.732 --> 58:07.735
Hey, here he is. Want a beer?
Love one.

58:08.736 --> 58:10.989
Another.
You here with Barbara?

58:11.156 --> 58:14.242
No, she hates these things.
Karen, too.

58:14.492 --> 58:15.743
Yeah.
Smart ladies.

58:16.202 --> 58:17.829
<i>Sláinte.</i>

58:18.872 --> 58:19.873
Mmm.

58:20.206 --> 58:21.541
I met your new editor.

58:22.458 --> 58:24.794
Seemed like a decent fellow.
I think he is.

58:27.172 --> 58:31.176
Hey, I had an interesting conversation
with Eric Macleish the other day.

58:32.051 --> 58:36.723
Turns out he's been settling abuse
cases with the archdiocese for years.

58:37.390 --> 58:40.059
You really wanna
talk about this here?

58:40.560 --> 58:45.565
Jim, you said you helped out
on Father Barrett as a favor.

58:46.524 --> 58:48.026
That was a one-off?

58:51.529 --> 58:53.698
How many of these cases
have you been involved with?

58:55.074 --> 58:57.702
You know I can't answer that, Robby.
It's unethical.

58:59.162 --> 59:00.622
Is that all it is?

59:03.082 --> 59:07.212
So, this would be
the Robby Robinson

59:07.295 --> 59:09.130
I've always heard about
but never met.

59:11.341 --> 59:12.759
Listen to me, Jimmy.

59:13.509 --> 59:15.553
You wanna be on
the right side of this.

59:17.805 --> 59:20.600
This is the Church
you're talking about, Robby.

59:20.683 --> 59:22.352
Look around.
These are good people,

59:22.435 --> 59:24.270
done a lot of good
for this city.

59:26.022 --> 59:27.774
Enjoy the party.

59:36.574 --> 59:38.826
I've been through
a lot of these now.

59:38.910 --> 59:40.370
"Sick leave" isn't the
only designation they use

59:40.453 --> 59:42.330
when they take one of these
priests out of circulation.

59:42.413 --> 59:44.916
They use a slew of terms.
"Absent on leave,"

59:45.041 --> 59:47.460
"unassigned,"
"emergency response."

59:47.543 --> 59:50.023
They got a word for everything, these guys.
Hmm. Except "rape."

59:50.588 --> 59:53.049
And they move parishes way more
frequently than other priests.

59:53.132 --> 59:54.467
When I was a kid,
a priest moved

59:54.550 --> 59:56.219
after seven or eight years,
sometimes longer.

59:56.302 --> 59:58.596
These guys, it's two
to three years tops.

59:58.680 --> 01:00:01.015
And did they use these designations
for all of Saviano's priests?

01:00:01.099 --> 01:00:03.226
Yeah, it's a pretty
clear pattern.

01:00:03.309 --> 01:00:04.852
Guys, I got Sipe.

01:00:05.395 --> 01:00:08.314
<i>I think if you really
want to understand the crisis,</i>

01:00:08.481 --> 01:00:10.817
<i>you need to start with
the celibacy requirement.</i>

01:00:11.025 --> 01:00:12.777
<i>That was my first
major finding.</i>

01:00:13.194 --> 01:00:15.780
<i>Only 50% of the clergy
are celibate.</i>

01:00:16.948 --> 01:00:19.867
<i>Now, most of them are having
sex with other adults.</i>

01:00:20.410 --> 01:00:23.121
<i>But the fact remains that this
creates a culture of secrecy</i>

01:00:23.204 --> 01:00:26.207
<i>that tolerates and
even protects pedophiles.</i>

01:00:27.542 --> 01:00:31.296
So you believe the Church is aware
of the extent of this crisis?

01:00:31.462 --> 01:00:34.757
<i>Oh, absolutely. After the first
major scandal in Louisiana,</i>

01:00:34.924 --> 01:00:38.052
<i>Tom Doyle, the secretary-canonist
for the papal nuncio,</i>

01:00:38.219 --> 01:00:40.972
<i>co-authored a report
warning pedophile priests</i>

01:00:41.055 --> 01:00:43.224
<i>were a
billion-dollar liability.</i>

01:00:43.474 --> 01:00:45.018
<i>That was in 1985.</i>

01:00:45.184 --> 01:00:47.353
1985?
<i>That's right.</i>

01:00:48.438 --> 01:00:50.940
Who saw that report?
Anyone from the Catholic hierarchy?

01:00:51.316 --> 01:00:52.525
<i>Sure.</i>

01:00:52.608 --> 01:00:54.235
<i>Doyle tried to introduce
the report at</i>

01:00:54.319 --> 01:00:56.571
<i>the National Conference
of Catholic Bishops.</i>

01:00:57.071 --> 01:01:00.575
<i>In fact, Cardinal Law initially
helped to fund the report.</i>

01:01:00.742 --> 01:01:02.785
<i>But then he backed out,
and they shelved it.</i>

01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:03.953
Are you kidding me?

01:01:04.037 --> 01:01:06.289
Richard, Robby here.

01:01:06.664 --> 01:01:11.085
We think we have 13 priests in
Boston that fit this pattern,

01:01:11.252 --> 01:01:14.922
which would be
a very, very big story.

01:01:15.089 --> 01:01:18.092
Does that sound right to you
in terms of scale?

01:01:19.052 --> 01:01:21.763
<i>No, not really, Robby.
It sounds low to me.</i>

01:01:22.805 --> 01:01:26.309
<i>My estimates suggest 6% act
out sexually with minors.</i>

01:01:27.602 --> 01:01:29.187
Uh, 6% of what?

01:01:29.854 --> 01:01:32.106
<i>6% of all priests.</i>

01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:33.775
How many priests
do we have in Boston?

01:01:33.858 --> 01:01:35.818
About 1,500.
1% is 15.

01:01:35.985 --> 01:01:38.363
6% is

01:01:38.446 --> 01:01:39.655
90.

01:01:40.615 --> 01:01:44.202
All right, 90 priests.
Is that possible?

01:01:44.786 --> 01:01:46.954
<i>From a metric standpoint,</i>

01:01:47.121 --> 01:01:50.958
<i>yes, that would certainly be
in line with my findings.</i>

01:01:57.215 --> 01:01:58.216
<i>Hello?</i>

01:01:58.299 --> 01:01:59.384
Uh...

01:02:00.885 --> 01:02:02.970
Ninety fucking priests?
In Boston?

01:02:03.471 --> 01:02:04.806
That's what he said.

01:02:06.057 --> 01:02:08.309
If there were 90 of these bastards,
people would know.

01:02:08.559 --> 01:02:09.936
Maybe they do.

01:02:10.019 --> 01:02:11.479
And no one said a thing?

01:02:12.188 --> 01:02:13.189
Good Germans?

01:02:14.357 --> 01:02:16.797
I don't think that's a comparison
you want to make publically.

01:02:17.026 --> 01:02:19.529
Macleish knew.
He just didn't say anything.

01:02:19.946 --> 01:02:21.489
That's 13 priests.

01:02:21.572 --> 01:02:23.533
There's a big difference
between 13 and 90.

01:02:23.699 --> 01:02:25.339
Where's this guy Sipe
getting his numbers?

01:02:25.493 --> 01:02:27.370
Well, he's been studying
it for 30 years.

01:02:27.453 --> 01:02:28.996
He is a trained
psychotherapist.

01:02:29.163 --> 01:02:31.999
Okay, but we need something
more than a metric

01:02:32.166 --> 01:02:34.377
from some hippy ex-priest
who's shacking up with a nun.

01:02:34.669 --> 01:02:37.880
Okay, so we'll track down more victims.
We'll get more priests.

01:02:37.964 --> 01:02:40.508
Then we can check them
against the directories.

01:02:40.591 --> 01:02:41.968
That's a shitload
of victims.

01:02:42.051 --> 01:02:43.594
We'll get there.

01:02:43.678 --> 01:02:44.762
How long's it gonna take?

01:02:46.222 --> 01:02:47.348
Too long.

01:02:49.016 --> 01:02:50.226
Wait, but...
Meeting's over?

01:02:50.351 --> 01:02:51.561
Yeah, for now.

01:02:54.063 --> 01:02:56.399
Look, what've you got?
What if we work backwards?

01:02:57.191 --> 01:02:59.151
What do you mean? From what?
From the directories.

01:02:59.193 --> 01:03:01.028
We've been using them
to confirm bad priests.

01:03:01.195 --> 01:03:02.447
What if we do it
the other way around?

01:03:02.530 --> 01:03:04.850
Use the directories to identify
bad priests. Yeah, exactly.

01:03:04.949 --> 01:03:06.409
We search by designation.

01:03:06.576 --> 01:03:09.370
We look for any priest on
"sick leave" or "unassigned."

01:03:09.454 --> 01:03:11.622
Or have been moved around a lot.
Yeah.

01:03:11.706 --> 01:03:13.207
It's gonna take
a load of work.

01:03:13.291 --> 01:03:15.293
Well, not if we're
all on it.

01:03:15.376 --> 01:03:16.544
You, too?

01:03:16.586 --> 01:03:19.422
Generally that's what "all" means. Yeah.
Yeah, generally.

01:04:13.476 --> 01:04:15.478
Library is closing.

01:04:18.231 --> 01:04:20.233
Library is closing.

01:04:29.492 --> 01:04:30.785
Holy shit.

01:05:18.374 --> 01:05:20.376
No freakin' way.

01:05:29.218 --> 01:05:30.261
- Talbot.
- Yeah.

01:05:30.344 --> 01:05:31.345
- Tivnan.
- Yeah.

01:05:31.846 --> 01:05:32.930
Toma.
Yeah.

01:05:33.014 --> 01:05:34.348
Turnbull.
Yeah.

01:05:34.432 --> 01:05:35.600
Walsh.
Yeah.

01:05:35.683 --> 01:05:36.892
Welsh.
Yeah.

01:05:36.976 --> 01:05:38.436
That's it.
That's it.

01:05:38.519 --> 01:05:39.937
Holy shit.
Robby?

01:05:40.021 --> 01:05:42.398
That's three off Sipe's estimate.
That's incredible.

01:05:42.481 --> 01:05:43.691
Robby?

01:05:43.774 --> 01:05:44.942
How many?
Eighty-seven.

01:05:45.026 --> 01:05:47.028
Eighty-seven priests
in Boston.

01:05:49.697 --> 01:05:52.533
Call Macleish. I wanna talk to him.
Okay.

01:05:53.367 --> 01:05:56.162
Can you print it?
Sure can.

01:05:58.789 --> 01:06:00.249
<i>Jim Sullivan's office.</i>

01:06:00.333 --> 01:06:02.543
Yeah, Walter Robinson
for Jim Sullivan.

01:06:02.627 --> 01:06:04.295
Tell him it's important,
please.

01:06:04.462 --> 01:06:06.047
<i>One moment, please.</i>

01:06:10.843 --> 01:06:12.303
<i>Hey, Robby.
Everything okay?</i>

01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:14.388
I need you
to tell me something, Jim.

01:06:14.722 --> 01:06:16.390
Could it be 90 priests?

01:06:16.974 --> 01:06:19.143
<i>What?</i>
Could it be as high as 90?

01:06:19.810 --> 01:06:21.228
<i>Jesus, Robby.</i>

01:06:21.354 --> 01:06:24.857
I need to know, Jim. I wouldn't
be asking if it wasn't important.

01:06:26.901 --> 01:06:28.653
<i>You gotta stop this, Robby.</i>

01:06:36.744 --> 01:06:39.914
Robby, Macleish's assistant said
he's all booked up, he can't see us.

01:06:40.831 --> 01:06:42.833
Yeah. Well, the hell
he can't.

01:06:48.422 --> 01:06:50.424
All right.
That'll be fun.

01:06:54.261 --> 01:06:55.805
You know what,
I'll catch up with you, okay?

01:06:55.888 --> 01:06:57.264
We're good.

01:06:57.431 --> 01:06:59.600
Hey, guys,
I'm really sorry, I am,

01:06:59.684 --> 01:07:00.851
but I don't have any time
to talk right now,

01:07:00.935 --> 01:07:02.144
but if you call
my assistant...

01:07:02.228 --> 01:07:03.396
Mr. Macleish,
we have reason to believe

01:07:03.479 --> 01:07:06.119
that there are allegations against
as many as 87 priests in Boston.

01:07:07.108 --> 01:07:08.567
I can't talk to you
about that.

01:07:08.609 --> 01:07:10.569
Does that number sound right to you?
You gotta be kidding me.

01:07:10.653 --> 01:07:12.530
I just told you I don't have
time for this crap right now.

01:07:12.613 --> 01:07:14.782
Eric. How many priests
did you settle?

01:07:16.242 --> 01:07:17.451
Robby, you know
I can't tell you that.

01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:20.830
You're gonna give me the names
and the names of their victims.

01:07:22.957 --> 01:07:24.125
Are you threatening me?

01:07:24.625 --> 01:07:26.502
We've got two stories here.

01:07:26.585 --> 01:07:28.504
We've got a story
about degenerate clergy,

01:07:28.671 --> 01:07:30.548
and we've got a story
about a bunch of lawyers

01:07:30.631 --> 01:07:33.092
turning child abuse
into a cottage industry.

01:07:33.676 --> 01:07:36.053
Now, which story
do you want us to write?

01:07:36.137 --> 01:07:37.805
'Cause we're writing
one of them.

01:07:41.475 --> 01:07:43.978
I already sent you
a list of names.

01:07:45.312 --> 01:07:46.939
What're you talking about?
To whom?

01:07:47.189 --> 01:07:49.859
The <i>Globe</i>. Years ago.

01:07:49.942 --> 01:07:51.902
After the Porter case.
I got plenty of calls.

01:07:51.986 --> 01:07:54.321
I had 20 priests
in Boston alone,

01:07:54.405 --> 01:07:56.245
but I couldn't go after them
without the press.

01:07:56.490 --> 01:08:00.953
So I sent you guys a list of names,
and you buried it.

01:08:03.164 --> 01:08:04.540
I want those names tomorrow.

01:08:04.790 --> 01:08:06.834
Check your
goddamn clips, Robby.

01:08:09.128 --> 01:08:10.671
We didn't find
anything in the clips.

01:08:10.838 --> 01:08:12.673
Yeah. Big surprise.

01:08:14.133 --> 01:08:17.344
Richard, do you still
go to mass?

01:08:17.970 --> 01:08:20.555
<i>No. No, I haven't been
to church for some time now.</i>

01:08:20.848 --> 01:08:23.142
<i>But I still
consider myself a Catholic.</i>

01:08:23.475 --> 01:08:24.852
How does that work?

01:08:25.185 --> 01:08:27.729
<i>Well, the church
is an institution, Mike.</i>

01:08:28.147 --> 01:08:29.648
<i>Made of men.</i>

01:08:29.732 --> 01:08:32.859
<i>It's passing.
My faith is in the eternal.</i>

01:08:33.861 --> 01:08:35.529
<i>I try to separate the two.</i>

01:08:36.322 --> 01:08:38.698
Sounds tricky.
<i>It is.</i>

01:08:38.908 --> 01:08:41.577
<i>Especially since the Church
continues to go after me.</i>

01:08:42.161 --> 01:08:43.662
<i>It takes a toll, Mike.</i>

01:08:44.205 --> 01:08:45.965
<i>They'll try to silence
anyone who speaks out.</i>

01:08:45.997 --> 01:08:48.375
<i>I'm sure they'll come after you
and your team soon enough.</i>

01:08:48.667 --> 01:08:50.877
Really? And how do you think
they'll do that?

01:08:54.715 --> 01:08:56.341
Hello?

01:08:56.509 --> 01:08:57.510
Richard?

01:09:04.058 --> 01:09:05.225
Who is it?

01:09:05.309 --> 01:09:07.310
It's the archbishop
of Canterbury.

01:09:11.064 --> 01:09:12.944
I had dinner at Santarpio's,
had some leftovers.

01:09:13.067 --> 01:09:16.529
Ah, you're the freakin' best.
Thanks. You want a beer?

01:09:17.238 --> 01:09:19.615
Yeah.
You got it.

01:09:19.782 --> 01:09:21.242
Jesus.

01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:23.202
How much longer you gonna be
in this shithole?

01:09:23.285 --> 01:09:24.912
Yeah. I'm working on it.

01:09:25.746 --> 01:09:27.081
She's a good girl, Mike.

01:09:27.247 --> 01:09:30.334
Yeah, she is.
We'll figure it out.

01:09:30.417 --> 01:09:32.962
I haven't had
a lot of time lately.

01:09:33.045 --> 01:09:34.805
I just got off the phone
with Sipe, actually.

01:09:35.548 --> 01:09:37.174
Have you met this guy
in person yet?

01:09:37.716 --> 01:09:41.053
No, but his knowledge of this
is on a whole other level.

01:09:41.136 --> 01:09:42.304
I'm freaking starving.

01:09:44.807 --> 01:09:46.600
So, where are we
with the 90?

01:09:47.434 --> 01:09:49.478
We're close.
How close?

01:09:49.603 --> 01:09:52.106
We're close.
Just answer the question, will you?

01:09:55.442 --> 01:09:57.570
We got 87 names.

01:09:57.653 --> 01:09:59.613
We're trying to get confirmation.
I think we will.

01:10:02.408 --> 01:10:03.826
Something bugging you?

01:10:04.451 --> 01:10:05.995
It's just surprising,
that's all.

01:10:07.121 --> 01:10:10.499
Yeah. Yeah, it is.
For everybody.

01:10:15.963 --> 01:10:18.507
Oh, hey, Ben.
I forgot to ask you.

01:10:19.008 --> 01:10:22.219
Phil Saviano said he sent a bunch of
info over to the <i>Globe</i> years ago.

01:10:22.303 --> 01:10:23.804
Do you have any idea to who?

01:10:24.305 --> 01:10:25.556
No, why?

01:10:25.639 --> 01:10:27.159
Well, I'm just curious.
I wanted to see

01:10:27.308 --> 01:10:29.068
if there's any leads
you guys didn't run out.

01:10:29.476 --> 01:10:31.687
Saviano was a fucking train
wreck five years ago, Mike.

01:10:31.770 --> 01:10:33.105
We didn't miss anything.

01:10:33.188 --> 01:10:34.857
This story needed Spotlight.

01:10:36.317 --> 01:10:38.319
Yeah, I agree.
I'm just following up.

01:10:41.322 --> 01:10:42.990
Good night.
Yeah, good night.

01:10:47.828 --> 01:10:49.038
This is unbelievable.

01:10:49.121 --> 01:10:50.289
When did you get this?

01:10:50.497 --> 01:10:52.499
Macleish emailed
the list this morning.

01:10:52.625 --> 01:10:55.210
He settled cases
against 45 priests.

01:10:56.003 --> 01:10:57.755
Where are we on Law?

01:10:57.838 --> 01:10:59.757
Anything that shows he
had knowledge of this?

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:02.134
We're still working Garabedian.
But nothing concrete.

01:11:02.468 --> 01:11:04.762
I keep thinking about that
conversation we had the other night

01:11:04.845 --> 01:11:07.222
about how Law called
down the power of God

01:11:07.306 --> 01:11:09.683
when we reported on Porter.

01:11:10.059 --> 01:11:12.144
That's just Law
being Law.

01:11:12.227 --> 01:11:13.771
Okay, but I checked the clips,

01:11:13.854 --> 01:11:17.399
and, uh, Porter isn't even
in the Boston archdiocese.

01:11:17.566 --> 01:11:20.235
- He's from Fall River.
- So

01:11:20.319 --> 01:11:21.862
why the extreme reaction?

01:11:23.572 --> 01:11:25.074
Law had to know.

01:11:25.699 --> 01:11:27.534
That's why he
had the reaction.

01:11:27.826 --> 01:11:29.370
Because he knew
there were others.

01:11:32.706 --> 01:11:34.541
I think that's
the bigger story.

01:11:36.043 --> 01:11:37.586
Bigger than 50 priests?

01:11:38.337 --> 01:11:40.464
If it came from
the top down, yes.

01:11:40.839 --> 01:11:42.383
But the numbers
clearly indicate

01:11:42.508 --> 01:11:44.028
that there were senior
clergy involved.

01:11:44.176 --> 01:11:45.427
That's all they do.
Indicate.

01:11:45.594 --> 01:11:47.262
Are you telling me
that if we run a story

01:11:47.388 --> 01:11:49.056
with 50 pedophile
priests in Boston...

01:11:49.139 --> 01:11:50.391
Mike!

01:11:50.474 --> 01:11:52.714
We'll get into the same cat
fight you got into on Porter,

01:11:52.768 --> 01:11:54.311
which made a lot of noise,

01:11:54.395 --> 01:11:56.397
but changed things
not one bit.

01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:03.237
We need to focus on the institution,
not the individual priests.

01:12:03.862 --> 01:12:05.155
Practice and policy.

01:12:05.698 --> 01:12:07.491
Show me the Church
manipulated the system

01:12:07.574 --> 01:12:09.201
so that these guys wouldn't
have to face charges.

01:12:09.284 --> 01:12:11.245
Show me they put
those same priests

01:12:11.412 --> 01:12:13.372
back into parishes,
time and time again.

01:12:13.455 --> 01:12:14.957
Show me this was systemic,

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:17.084
that it came
from the top down.

01:12:19.294 --> 01:12:21.255
Sounds like we're
going after Law.

01:12:25.426 --> 01:12:27.428
We're going
after the system.

01:12:30.222 --> 01:12:32.933
Make a list of all the victims we have.
Start reaching out.

01:12:33.142 --> 01:12:34.862
And bring Matt in if you need help.
Mmm-hmm.

01:12:34.935 --> 01:12:36.478
Okay. Hey, when you
go to Springfield?

01:12:36.645 --> 01:12:38.605
- Our hearing is Monday.
- Okay.

01:12:39.273 --> 01:12:40.941
Hey, Robby,
you got a second?

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:42.401
Yeah.

01:12:43.444 --> 01:12:45.863
I, uh, got one of those
treatment centers

01:12:45.946 --> 01:12:47.114
a block from
my house.

01:12:49.450 --> 01:12:51.035
We got neighbors
with kids.

01:12:51.118 --> 01:12:54.371
I know that the work we do is
confidential, but I'm feeling like...

01:12:55.581 --> 01:12:56.707
I should tell 'em.

01:13:01.170 --> 01:13:02.463
We'll tell 'em soon.

01:13:03.630 --> 01:13:04.631
You sure?

01:13:05.966 --> 01:13:07.134
Yeah.
Okay.

01:13:10.554 --> 01:13:13.057
Hi there. I'm Sacha Pfeiffer.
I'm with <i>The Boston Globe.</i>

01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:15.851
I was just looking for a gentleman
by the name of Matthew Walsh.

01:13:16.643 --> 01:13:18.562
Uh...
No, he's not.

01:13:23.358 --> 01:13:24.526
Yeah, okay. Okay.

01:13:31.742 --> 01:13:32.785
Hi.
Hi.

01:13:32.868 --> 01:13:34.119
I'm Sacha Pfeiffer
from <i>The Boston Globe.</i>

01:13:34.244 --> 01:13:35.454
Yeah, what do you want?

01:13:35.537 --> 01:13:37.017
I'd like to speak
with Thomas Kennedy.

01:13:37.164 --> 01:13:38.415
He doesn't live
here anymore.

01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:39.792
Do you know
where he lives?

01:13:40.167 --> 01:13:41.835
Sir, I'd just like
to ask a few...

01:13:44.004 --> 01:13:45.130
Uh, Sacha Pfeiffer,
<i>Boston Globe.</i>

01:13:45.214 --> 01:13:46.673
Oh, yeah, hi.

01:13:46.757 --> 01:13:48.175
Hi. Thank you.

01:13:48.842 --> 01:13:50.302
Anything else
you can recall?

01:13:50.427 --> 01:13:51.887
No.

01:13:51.970 --> 01:13:53.847
No, but I got
a cousin in Quincy.

01:13:53.972 --> 01:13:55.808
She saw him in the street
a few years later.

01:13:56.683 --> 01:13:58.268
<i>The Bishop came
over to the house.</i>

01:13:58.352 --> 01:14:00.020
He said nothing like this
had ever happened before,

01:14:00.104 --> 01:14:01.647
and he asked us
not to press charges.

01:14:02.064 --> 01:14:03.857
And what did
your mother do?

01:14:03.941 --> 01:14:05.234
My mother?

01:14:06.693 --> 01:14:08.278
She put out
freakin' cookies.

01:14:12.616 --> 01:14:14.701
<i>There was a lot of
pressure to keep quiet.</i>

01:14:15.035 --> 01:14:16.036
From the Church?

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:17.871
Yeah, from
the Church.

01:14:17.955 --> 01:14:19.873
But not just
the Church.

01:14:20.415 --> 01:14:22.626
From my friends,

01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:24.253
from the other
parishioners.

01:14:24.419 --> 01:14:26.421
<i>Well, many of
the priests that I treated</i>

01:14:26.505 --> 01:14:28.799
<i>were psychosexually stunted,</i>

01:14:28.882 --> 01:14:31.135
<i>on the emotional level
of a 12- or 13-year-old.</i>

01:14:31.301 --> 01:14:32.636
Jeez.

01:14:32.719 --> 01:14:34.513
Sure the Chief knew.
Everybody knew,

01:14:34.638 --> 01:14:36.390
but nobody wants
to cuff a priest.

01:14:36.557 --> 01:14:37.558
Mmm.

01:14:38.142 --> 01:14:39.393
And what about
the prosecutor?

01:14:40.394 --> 01:14:41.979
I shouldn't talk
about this shit.

01:14:42.146 --> 01:14:44.356
I think you should,
actually.

01:14:44.439 --> 01:14:46.692
Do you know a Father Hurley
or a Father Gale?

01:14:47.442 --> 01:14:48.485
I do.

01:14:48.569 --> 01:14:49.736
I swear to God,
I'll beat the shit out of you.

01:14:49.903 --> 01:14:51.029
Sorry to bother you.

01:14:51.113 --> 01:14:52.281
You leave me alone,
you leave my brother alone!

01:14:52.364 --> 01:14:53.365
You hear me,
God damn it?

01:15:01.915 --> 01:15:04.042
Hi there.
I'm looking for Ronald Paquin.

01:15:04.126 --> 01:15:05.127
Yes?

01:15:06.295 --> 01:15:07.421
You're Father Paquin?

01:15:07.546 --> 01:15:08.630
Yes, that's right.

01:15:09.923 --> 01:15:11.967
I'm Sacha Pfeiffer
from <i>The Boston Globe.</i>

01:15:12.050 --> 01:15:13.050
Okay.

01:15:13.093 --> 01:15:14.511
Could I ask you
a few questions?

01:15:14.636 --> 01:15:16.138
Go ahead, dear.

01:15:16.805 --> 01:15:18.849
We spoke to several men who
you knew when they were boys

01:15:18.932 --> 01:15:20.601
at St. John the Baptist
in Haverhill.

01:15:23.145 --> 01:15:24.938
They told us you molested them.
Is that true?

01:15:27.441 --> 01:15:31.361
Sure I fooled around,
but I never felt gratified myself.

01:15:32.946 --> 01:15:35.699
Right. Um, but you
admit to molesting boys

01:15:35.782 --> 01:15:36.867
at St. John the Baptist?

01:15:37.951 --> 01:15:40.412
Yes, yes,
but as I said,

01:15:40.495 --> 01:15:42.039
I never got
any pleasure from it.

01:15:42.497 --> 01:15:44.499
That's important
to understand.

01:15:44.666 --> 01:15:45.667
Right.

01:15:46.001 --> 01:15:49.046
Um, but can you
tell me where and how

01:15:49.129 --> 01:15:50.449
you fooled around
with these boys?

01:15:52.049 --> 01:15:53.759
I want to be clear,

01:15:53.842 --> 01:15:55.469
I never raped anyone.

01:15:56.637 --> 01:15:58.805
There's a difference.
I should know.

01:15:59.473 --> 01:16:00.641
How would you know?

01:16:00.766 --> 01:16:01.892
I was raped.

01:16:04.645 --> 01:16:06.438
I'm sorry,
who raped you?

01:16:06.521 --> 01:16:07.522
Ronnie, who're
you talking to?

01:16:07.689 --> 01:16:09.107
It's okay, Jane.
Father Paquin, who raped you?

01:16:09.191 --> 01:16:10.192
Who are you?

01:16:10.651 --> 01:16:12.527
Uh... Sacha Pfeiffer,
from the <i>Globe.</i>

01:16:12.694 --> 01:16:14.574
Please get off my porch.
I can speak for myself.

01:16:14.655 --> 01:16:16.657
Get inside the house, Ronnie.
Mr...

01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:18.533
Get inside, Ronald.
Sorry.

01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:19.785
Uh, I'm sorry, who are you?

01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:20.953
I'm his sister,

01:16:21.036 --> 01:16:22.246
and I don't want
you coming back here.

01:16:22.329 --> 01:16:23.497
Ms. Paquin...

01:16:31.213 --> 01:16:32.839
Beat you to
the end of the street!

01:16:32.965 --> 01:16:34.645
No, you won't.
I beat you last time!

01:16:34.716 --> 01:16:35.796
No, you didn't,
you cheated!

01:16:35.842 --> 01:16:36.885
You did!

01:16:43.433 --> 01:16:47.521
Could you please clarify the <i>Globe's</i>
position for me, Mr. Albano?

01:16:47.771 --> 01:16:49.189
Yes, Judge Sweeney.

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:55.779
Our argument to make
these documents public

01:16:55.862 --> 01:16:58.490
rests mainly on
First Amendment grounds.

01:16:58.782 --> 01:17:01.368
We also have a number
of other relevant arguments.

01:17:01.451 --> 01:17:02.452
After all, Your Honor,

01:17:02.536 --> 01:17:03.787
this was a
discretionary order.

01:17:04.204 --> 01:17:06.707
Yes, it was made
at the Judge's discretion.

01:17:06.873 --> 01:17:08.166
Hey, Mike.

01:17:08.292 --> 01:17:09.543
Hey, Joe.

01:17:10.377 --> 01:17:11.461
What's a
Spotlight reporter

01:17:11.545 --> 01:17:12.671
doing in Springfield?

01:17:15.048 --> 01:17:17.634
Your boy Albano's
sledding uphill.

01:17:17.718 --> 01:17:19.594
You actually think you have a
shot at winning this thing?

01:17:19.761 --> 01:17:21.471
You want me to comment
for the <i>Herald?</i>

01:17:23.724 --> 01:17:26.226
<i>"Globe</i> reporter
would not comment,

01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:29.646
"but he did not
seem hopeful."

01:17:30.772 --> 01:17:32.691
He didn't try
and hide it at all.

01:17:32.774 --> 01:17:35.652
He had this really odd
rationalization for it.

01:17:35.736 --> 01:17:37.154
Like it was
totally normal

01:17:37.237 --> 01:17:38.477
to fool around
with little boys.

01:17:39.406 --> 01:17:41.700
I'd really like to go back.
I think he'd talk to us.

01:17:42.534 --> 01:17:43.910
Oh, we will.

01:17:44.411 --> 01:17:45.829
Just not yet.

01:17:45.912 --> 01:17:48.623
I want you to stay focused
on the victims right now.

01:17:48.707 --> 01:17:51.126
Sacha, where'd they send
Father Talbot again?

01:17:51.209 --> 01:17:53.253
Um, I think...
Wasn't that Cheverus?

01:17:53.628 --> 01:17:54.713
Cheverus, that's right.

01:17:54.796 --> 01:17:57.341
Wait, Father Talbot
from BC High?

01:17:57.758 --> 01:17:59.468
Yeah, you know him?

01:17:59.634 --> 01:18:01.803
Yeah, he was there
when I was.

01:18:02.429 --> 01:18:03.472
We have a victim?

01:18:03.555 --> 01:18:05.766
Yeah, lives
in Providence.

01:18:09.436 --> 01:18:12.356
There's nothing personal in
these documents, Your Honor.

01:18:12.439 --> 01:18:13.774
They concern how the
Cardinal is handling...

01:18:13.899 --> 01:18:15.233
Say "the archdiocese."

01:18:16.610 --> 01:18:17.736
Excuse me?

01:18:17.819 --> 01:18:19.237
You don't get to
tag the Cardinal

01:18:19.321 --> 01:18:21.156
with everything,
Mr. Albano.

01:18:21.239 --> 01:18:22.908
Say "the archdiocese."

01:18:23.575 --> 01:18:25.535
Judge Sweeney, the <i>Globe</i>
is not a party to this case,

01:18:25.619 --> 01:18:26.703
they just want
to sell papers.

01:18:26.787 --> 01:18:29.122
If Mr. Garabedian
had not smeared

01:18:29.206 --> 01:18:30.499
the Cardinal's
good name,

01:18:31.124 --> 01:18:32.584
we wouldn't even be here.

01:18:32.667 --> 01:18:34.795
Your Honor, I object to the
use of the word "smear."

01:18:34.961 --> 01:18:36.505
Duly noted,
Mr. Garabedian.

01:18:36.588 --> 01:18:37.748
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:18:37.798 --> 01:18:38.798
Anything else,
Mr. Rogers?

01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:39.841
No, Your Honor.

01:18:40.092 --> 01:18:42.135
Mr. Albano,
you may continue.

01:18:42.302 --> 01:18:43.382
<i>The Globe</i>
believes having...

01:18:45.639 --> 01:18:47.724
Hey, Mitch,
how are you doing?

01:18:48.141 --> 01:18:49.142
I'm fine.

01:18:49.976 --> 01:18:52.312
He's tough,
that Wilson Rogers.

01:18:52.771 --> 01:18:53.980
He's smug.

01:18:54.481 --> 01:18:55.816
And he's sloppy.

01:18:56.066 --> 01:18:57.651
He doesn't seem sloppy.

01:18:58.318 --> 01:19:00.070
You don't know the half of it.
Trust me.

01:19:01.446 --> 01:19:03.156
What's the
half of it?

01:19:05.325 --> 01:19:06.576
Tell me the
half of it, Mitch.

01:19:08.745 --> 01:19:10.747
Off the record?
Off the record, yeah.

01:19:14.334 --> 01:19:16.837
Three years ago,
I get a call from an ex-priest.

01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:18.171
Anthony Benzevich.

01:19:18.338 --> 01:19:20.590
He was at Blessed
Sacrament back in '62,

01:19:20.757 --> 01:19:22.968
and he saw Geoghan

01:19:24.136 --> 01:19:26.263
taking little boys up to
the rectory bedroom, okay?

01:19:26.346 --> 01:19:28.265
So he's appalled,
all right?

01:19:28.348 --> 01:19:29.474
Tells the bishop
about it.

01:19:30.434 --> 01:19:32.269
The bishop threatens
to reassign him

01:19:32.686 --> 01:19:34.187
to South America.

01:19:34.271 --> 01:19:35.772
Jesus.
Yeah, all right.

01:19:35.856 --> 01:19:37.274
So fast forward 35 years,

01:19:37.357 --> 01:19:39.109
Benzevich reads that
Geoghan's been charged

01:19:39.234 --> 01:19:41.027
with molesting
hundreds of kids.

01:19:41.194 --> 01:19:43.447
All right? So he feels guilty.
He calls me.

01:19:43.530 --> 01:19:45.699
So you have
testimony of a priest

01:19:45.866 --> 01:19:48.034
telling his superiors
about Geoghan in '62?

01:19:48.702 --> 01:19:50.203
No, I do not.

01:19:50.287 --> 01:19:52.873
Because when I called Benzevich
in to give a deposition,

01:19:53.039 --> 01:19:54.207
he comes in
with a lawyer.

01:19:55.041 --> 01:19:56.668
Wilson Rogers.
Right.

01:19:57.127 --> 01:19:58.295
And suddenly
Father Benzevich

01:19:58.378 --> 01:19:59.629
has a very foggy memory.

01:19:59.838 --> 01:20:01.798
Can't remember anything.
He's useless.

01:20:01.965 --> 01:20:03.091
So I go back to work,

01:20:03.175 --> 01:20:04.509
I forget about it.
Whatever.

01:20:05.218 --> 01:20:07.053
Until about a year ago,
I find an article

01:20:07.137 --> 01:20:10.223
about a priest who warned
church officials about Geoghan.

01:20:10.724 --> 01:20:12.559
Benzevich went to the press?
Yeah.

01:20:12.893 --> 01:20:15.395
Yeah, local paper, <i>Patriot Ledger.</i>
Nobody saw it.

01:20:15.562 --> 01:20:17.147
But now I got
Benzevich on record.

01:20:17.314 --> 01:20:20.567
So I file a motion to depose
Benzevich a second time.

01:20:21.151 --> 01:20:22.861
All right?
And Wilson Rogers,

01:20:22.944 --> 01:20:24.488
that smug son of a bitch,

01:20:24.654 --> 01:20:27.240
he files a motion
opposing my motion.

01:20:27.824 --> 01:20:29.201
And that's when
I have him.

01:20:30.744 --> 01:20:31.912
Have him how?

01:20:32.329 --> 01:20:33.872
Rogers opposes my motion,

01:20:34.039 --> 01:20:35.332
so I have to
make an argument

01:20:35.415 --> 01:20:36.458
as to why I'm
allowed to depose

01:20:36.541 --> 01:20:38.376
Father Benzevich
a second time, okay?

01:20:38.585 --> 01:20:41.254
But this time,
I'm allowed to attach exhibits.

01:20:41.838 --> 01:20:42.998
Do you follow
what I'm saying?

01:20:43.548 --> 01:20:44.758
The sealed documents?
Yes.

01:20:45.091 --> 01:20:47.093
I can attach
the sealed documents

01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:49.262
that I've gotten in discovery,
Mr. Rezendes,

01:20:49.429 --> 01:20:52.349
the same documents that your
paper is currently suing for.

01:20:53.266 --> 01:20:54.476
You're shitting me?

01:20:54.559 --> 01:20:56.436
What?
No. No, I'm not shitting you.

01:20:56.603 --> 01:20:59.439
So I pull out the 14
most damning docs

01:20:59.523 --> 01:21:00.899
and I attach 'em
to my motion.

01:21:01.066 --> 01:21:02.734
And they prove
everything. Everything.

01:21:02.943 --> 01:21:05.445
About the Church,
about the bishops, about Law.

01:21:05.612 --> 01:21:07.280
And it's all public?

01:21:07.572 --> 01:21:10.033
Because your motion
to oppose Roger's motion

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:12.202
is public.
Yeah, exactly.

01:21:12.285 --> 01:21:13.411
Now you're
paying attention.

01:21:13.578 --> 01:21:15.580
So I could just walk into
that courthouse right now

01:21:15.747 --> 01:21:16.873
and get those documents?

01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:18.708
No, you cannot,

01:21:18.792 --> 01:21:20.293
because the documents
are not there.

01:21:20.961 --> 01:21:22.295
But you just
said they're public.

01:21:22.379 --> 01:21:25.507
I know I did,
but this is Boston,

01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:29.094
and the Church does not
want them to be found.

01:21:29.427 --> 01:21:30.804
So they are not there.

01:21:32.722 --> 01:21:35.141
Mitch, are you telling me
that the Catholic Church

01:21:35.308 --> 01:21:37.602
removed legal documents
from that courthouse?

01:21:38.144 --> 01:21:41.147
Look, I'm not crazy,
I'm not paranoid.

01:21:41.314 --> 01:21:42.482
I'm experienced.

01:21:42.649 --> 01:21:44.651
Check the docket.
You'll see.

01:21:45.735 --> 01:21:47.153
They control everything.

01:21:50.073 --> 01:21:51.241
Everything.

01:21:53.326 --> 01:21:54.953
I gotta go back in.

01:21:58.665 --> 01:22:01.459
These guys got
the fucking documents.

01:22:15.765 --> 01:22:18.977
Docket entry number 49,
it's in the Geoghan case.

01:22:19.144 --> 01:22:20.224
We're closing
in 10 minutes.

01:22:20.353 --> 01:22:22.022
Ten minutes?
All right.

01:22:59.225 --> 01:23:00.977
- Robby.
<i>- Hey, it's me.</i>

01:23:01.061 --> 01:23:02.437
Hey.
<i>You're not gonna believe it.</i>

01:23:02.854 --> 01:23:06.358
Garabedian gave me a tip.
Some of the sealed docs are already public.

01:23:06.524 --> 01:23:07.859
They're part of
a motion he filed.

01:23:08.276 --> 01:23:09.819
<i>He said they're
the best of the bunch.</i>

01:23:09.944 --> 01:23:11.488
<i>We don't have to wait
for Sweeney's ruling.</i>

01:23:11.571 --> 01:23:12.739
So we can get them?

01:23:12.864 --> 01:23:13.990
<i>Yeah, but they're not there.</i>

01:23:14.324 --> 01:23:15.325
Already talked to Albano.

01:23:15.408 --> 01:23:17.285
He said all we have
to do is file a motion,

01:23:17.452 --> 01:23:19.829
and Sweeney will order Mitch
to refile the docs.

01:23:20.413 --> 01:23:21.956
And you think
these documents are...

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:24.709
<i>He said these 14 docs were all we need.
They're huge.</i>

01:23:24.834 --> 01:23:29.005
Okay. I'll call Ben.
Good work.

01:23:45.397 --> 01:23:47.399
...<i>whether</i>
<i>this was truly an accident</i>

01:23:47.482 --> 01:23:48.942
<i>or someone committed
an intentional act.</i>

01:23:49.025 --> 01:23:50.652
<i>But either way,
extensive damage</i>

01:23:50.735 --> 01:23:52.112
<i>has been done
to this building.</i>

01:23:54.489 --> 01:23:56.282
What happened?

01:23:56.366 --> 01:23:58.284
They're saying
it's a prop plane,

01:23:58.368 --> 01:23:59.536
but that's not
a prop plane.

01:24:03.790 --> 01:24:06.459
Tell Linda to get every
reporter we have in here now.

01:24:08.044 --> 01:24:09.804
<i>You pray for the victims,</i>

01:24:09.879 --> 01:24:12.590
<i>you pray for the injured,</i>

01:24:13.258 --> 01:24:15.760
<i>and you pray for
those who survived.</i>

01:24:16.928 --> 01:24:19.681
<i>You pray, too, for the nation.</i>

01:24:21.015 --> 01:24:27.063
<i>That our response to this might reflect
the best ideals of our nation.</i>

01:24:28.314 --> 01:24:31.317
<i>And even more,
reflect God's own teaching.</i>

01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:35.864
<i>Not only as it's shown
in Christianity and Judaism,</i>

01:24:36.322 --> 01:24:38.283
<i>but in Islam as well.</i>

01:24:38.450 --> 01:24:40.785
Not bad. Who's there?
Paulson.

01:24:41.119 --> 01:24:42.620
I wanna talk to him
when he's back.

01:24:43.204 --> 01:24:45.004
Did Rezendes find a way
to get to Florida yet?

01:24:45.331 --> 01:24:46.875
They just opened the
airport in Providence.

01:24:46.958 --> 01:24:47.959
He's on his way
there now.

01:24:48.334 --> 01:24:50.378
Ben, I'm gonna need more
people on Massport.

01:24:50.462 --> 01:24:51.880
I'll give you
three of my guys.

01:24:51.963 --> 01:24:53.883
- Robby, put your team on that, too.
- Got it.

01:24:53.923 --> 01:24:55.216
And Robby,
everything else stops.

01:24:55.341 --> 01:24:56.676
Understood.

01:24:56.801 --> 01:24:58.178
Why's Mike going
to Florida?

01:24:58.261 --> 01:25:01.097
Flight school. It's
where they learned to fly.

01:25:01.181 --> 01:25:03.975
Robby, I've got a lot of victim
interviews set up this week.

01:25:04.058 --> 01:25:05.435
We have to cancel 'em.

01:25:05.518 --> 01:25:06.811
That's gonna be hard.
I know.

01:25:06.978 --> 01:25:08.938
This is nuts.
Two days ago I told my wife

01:25:09.105 --> 01:25:10.940
we gotta be working the
biggest story on the planet.

01:25:11.024 --> 01:25:12.317
<i>Boston Globe.</i>

01:25:12.484 --> 01:25:14.324
<i>Boston Globe.</i>
One moment, please.

01:25:14.527 --> 01:25:16.808
Yes, if you have a tip,
I will transfer you down to Metro.

01:25:19.115 --> 01:25:20.200
Mitchell Garabedian.

01:25:20.283 --> 01:25:21.659
<i>Mitch, it's Mike,
I've been trying to reach you.</i>

01:25:21.743 --> 01:25:23.453
I don't have time to talk to you,
Mr. Rezendes.

01:25:23.536 --> 01:25:26.247
Hey, just quickly,
did you refile those docs yet?

01:25:26.331 --> 01:25:28.171
<i>No, I just
got the order. It takes time.</i>

01:25:28.333 --> 01:25:29.959
Okay, great. Can you hold
off on refiling them?

01:25:30.126 --> 01:25:31.461
<i>Hold off?</i>
I have to go to Florida.

01:25:31.628 --> 01:25:33.046
Once you refile
they're public.

01:25:33.213 --> 01:25:35.213
Other newspapers will be
able to get a hold of 'em.

01:25:35.298 --> 01:25:39.135
<i>Other newspapers are not my concern.
I received a judicial order.</i>

01:25:39.344 --> 01:25:41.095
<i>I told you the Church
is watching me.</i>

01:25:41.262 --> 01:25:43.765
Oh, hey, Mitch, please.
All I need's a few more weeks.

01:25:45.391 --> 01:25:47.227
<i>I can't make any promises.
Goodbye.</i>

01:25:47.393 --> 01:25:49.854
Mitch? Mitch! Shit!

01:25:51.773 --> 01:25:52.774
Shit.

01:26:01.741 --> 01:26:03.785
<i>Look, I get it,
no one wants to read</i>

01:26:03.868 --> 01:26:05.161
<i>about kids getting
raped by priests.</i>

01:26:05.245 --> 01:26:06.329
Especially now.

01:26:06.412 --> 01:26:07.932
But you asked a lot
of people to relive

01:26:07.997 --> 01:26:09.332
some very
painful experiences,

01:26:09.415 --> 01:26:10.458
and you just disappear.

01:26:10.542 --> 01:26:12.168
Phil, you know why we were
taken off of the story.

01:26:12.252 --> 01:26:14.045
It's been six weeks
since 9/11.

01:26:14.170 --> 01:26:16.381
I realize that and we're
gonna get back to it.

01:26:16.548 --> 01:26:17.549
When?

01:26:19.217 --> 01:26:21.217
You're doing the same thing
you guys did last time.

01:26:21.261 --> 01:26:22.303
No.
You're dropping us.

01:26:22.428 --> 01:26:24.514
No. Maybe I should tell
the <i>Herald</i> that story.

01:26:25.849 --> 01:26:27.934
Okay, Phil,
you go ahead and do that.

01:26:28.685 --> 01:26:31.813
It will undo all the work we've done,
but I can't stop you.

01:26:34.023 --> 01:26:37.360
Listen to me.
I am here because I care.

01:26:39.445 --> 01:26:40.864
We're not going away.

01:26:41.614 --> 01:26:43.774
We're gonna tell this story,
we're gonna tell it right.

01:26:43.908 --> 01:26:46.452
We just need a little more time.
That's all we're asking for.

01:26:49.622 --> 01:26:51.207
Why bother asking?

01:26:52.584 --> 01:26:54.419
You're gonna do
what you want anyway.

01:26:55.587 --> 01:26:57.171
You always do.

01:26:57.881 --> 01:26:58.882
Phil.

01:26:59.841 --> 01:27:00.842
Phil.

01:27:06.890 --> 01:27:08.016
Hey.

01:27:08.099 --> 01:27:09.475
<i>How's South Beach?</i>

01:27:09.559 --> 01:27:12.312
Boynton Beach.
Remarkably different place.

01:27:12.812 --> 01:27:13.897
What's up?

01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:15.982
<i>Mitch Garabedian
called me today.</i>

01:27:16.274 --> 01:27:18.568
Why'd he call you?
<i>'Cause he knew you'd yell at him.</i>

01:27:18.943 --> 01:27:20.278
<i>He refiled the docs.</i>

01:27:20.445 --> 01:27:21.446
What?

01:27:21.946 --> 01:27:23.531
Robby, those docs
are public now.

01:27:23.615 --> 01:27:24.866
<i>We gotta get there
before anyone else does.</i>

01:27:24.949 --> 01:27:26.367
I know. I know. I know.

01:27:26.451 --> 01:27:28.244
Just wrap up
whatever you're doing

01:27:28.328 --> 01:27:29.448
and get
the first flight out.

01:27:29.495 --> 01:27:31.623
<i>I'll book a flight now and go
straight to the courthouse tomorrow.</i>

01:27:31.706 --> 01:27:33.708
All right. Call me when you get in.
<i>Okay.</i>

01:27:35.835 --> 01:27:38.838
Robby, I'd like to let Phil Saviano
know that we're back on it.

01:27:39.005 --> 01:27:40.590
Good idea.

01:27:40.673 --> 01:27:42.300
Go have dinner with Hansi.

01:27:42.383 --> 01:27:43.760
Might be the last time
for a while.

01:27:44.385 --> 01:27:45.386
Mmm-hmm.

01:27:49.724 --> 01:27:52.101
Robby, after
we saw Macleish,

01:27:52.185 --> 01:27:53.705
I started going
back through the clips,

01:27:54.062 --> 01:27:56.272
and I had a little time
last week finally.

01:27:56.356 --> 01:27:58.983
So, um, I found that.

01:28:00.276 --> 01:28:02.028
It's from '93.

01:28:11.955 --> 01:28:12.997
That it?

01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:17.502
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

01:28:20.004 --> 01:28:21.047
Good night.

01:28:22.256 --> 01:28:24.092
Okay, good night.

01:29:03.464 --> 01:29:05.383
So, I was probably a few
years after you, right?

01:29:05.550 --> 01:29:07.844
No, you were
more than a few.

01:29:07.927 --> 01:29:09.095
Believe me.

01:29:09.971 --> 01:29:12.890
Well, after BC High,
I came down to Providence

01:29:13.057 --> 01:29:14.475
and played hockey
for the Friars.

01:29:15.101 --> 01:29:17.478
Oh, well, you must
have been pretty good.

01:29:17.645 --> 01:29:19.981
No. Rode the bench in college.
Yeah. Oh.

01:29:20.398 --> 01:29:21.607
But I loved the city.

01:29:22.025 --> 01:29:23.818
Oh.
And we just had our third kid.

01:29:24.444 --> 01:29:26.112
And I still get my <i>Globe,</i>
for the record.

01:29:26.279 --> 01:29:28.781
Oh, that's good to know.
Good to know.

01:29:29.657 --> 01:29:33.661
Look, Kevin, uh,
that's actually why I'm here.

01:29:35.204 --> 01:29:39.459
I need to ask you some
questions about Father Talbot.

01:29:46.674 --> 01:29:48.092
How'd you find out?

01:29:49.510 --> 01:29:50.803
Well...

01:29:51.721 --> 01:29:53.556
I guess
it doesn't matter.

01:29:58.978 --> 01:30:01.981
And I never even
told my wife.

01:30:03.149 --> 01:30:04.817
Excuse me.

01:30:10.114 --> 01:30:12.194
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
I need to get in there.

01:30:12.241 --> 01:30:13.743
We're closed. Come on, let me in.
Five minutes.

01:30:13.826 --> 01:30:15.161
I'm sorry, we're closed.

01:30:15.286 --> 01:30:16.579
Come on. Five minutes.

01:30:25.254 --> 01:30:26.255
Hello.

01:30:31.886 --> 01:30:33.346
Here.

01:30:36.557 --> 01:30:38.351
This is the Geoghan case?
That's right.

01:30:39.185 --> 01:30:40.770
Those records are sealed.
No.

01:30:40.937 --> 01:30:43.564
That's a public motion.
Those records are public.

01:30:43.648 --> 01:30:44.857
Look, I work for the <i>Globe.</i>

01:30:45.858 --> 01:30:46.943
Good for you.

01:30:49.028 --> 01:30:50.404
Can I talk to
your supervisor?

01:30:50.530 --> 01:30:51.948
He's not in today.

01:30:52.448 --> 01:30:53.658
What about a judge?

01:30:53.741 --> 01:30:56.035
There must be judges that
work on this kind of thing.

01:30:56.536 --> 01:30:57.912
Sixth floor.

01:31:05.294 --> 01:31:07.894
We understand the nature of the
allegations against Father Talbot.

01:31:08.381 --> 01:31:11.467
I'm just not sure what you
want from President Kemeza.

01:31:12.218 --> 01:31:14.220
Talbot taught here long
before Bill took over.

01:31:14.387 --> 01:31:16.848
Mmm. Of course.
We just want to know

01:31:16.931 --> 01:31:18.724
if it's possible
that the president,

01:31:18.891 --> 01:31:20.226
the faculty, the board,

01:31:20.309 --> 01:31:22.109
that no one knew what was
going on at the time.

01:31:22.145 --> 01:31:26.482
I graduated in 1979, and I had
no idea about any of this.

01:31:26.899 --> 01:31:29.068
So if you're suggesting that
Father Gibbons and Father Callahan

01:31:29.152 --> 01:31:30.319
had in any way...

01:31:30.403 --> 01:31:32.280
Gibbons and Callahan...

01:31:32.363 --> 01:31:34.240
I mean, they ran this
place like the navy.

01:31:34.991 --> 01:31:36.431
Do you really think
they didn't know?

01:31:37.493 --> 01:31:39.495
It's a big school, Robby.
You know that.

01:31:40.246 --> 01:31:42.915
And we're talking about
seven alleged victims

01:31:43.082 --> 01:31:44.417
over, what, eight years.

01:31:44.584 --> 01:31:47.753
We're talking about
seven that we know about.

01:31:48.045 --> 01:31:49.755
This is ridiculous.

01:31:50.381 --> 01:31:52.541
You're reaching for a story here.
We cannot possibly...

01:31:52.592 --> 01:31:55.511
Jack. Jack. Jack.
If I had been president then,

01:31:55.595 --> 01:31:56.762
I would've known.

01:31:57.430 --> 01:31:59.265
Bill, I'm not sure
that's relevant.

01:31:59.432 --> 01:32:02.101
Why do you think they sent
Talbot up to Cheverus?

01:32:02.935 --> 01:32:04.937
You know they
wanted him out of town.

01:32:06.272 --> 01:32:10.026
Robby, as well
intentioned as Bill's remarks are,

01:32:10.109 --> 01:32:11.819
I'm hoping we can
keep this between us

01:32:11.944 --> 01:32:13.696
until we all get
on the same page.

01:32:17.408 --> 01:32:19.288
Is that why we're here,
to get on the same page?

01:32:19.911 --> 01:32:21.954
No, we're here because you're
an important alumnus, Robby,

01:32:22.038 --> 01:32:23.206
and a friend.

01:32:23.289 --> 01:32:26.667
Exactly, and we know you care about
this school as much as we do.

01:32:28.961 --> 01:32:30.463
Did you play
a sport here, Jack?

01:32:31.088 --> 01:32:32.798
Yeah. Football. Why?

01:32:33.257 --> 01:32:34.967
Mmm. I ran track.

01:32:35.051 --> 01:32:37.220
You know, I went to
Providence yesterday

01:32:37.345 --> 01:32:39.472
to talk to one of
Father Talbot's victims.

01:32:39.555 --> 01:32:40.973
He played hockey here.

01:32:41.432 --> 01:32:43.392
And, uh, he's one
of the better ones.

01:32:43.476 --> 01:32:46.437
He's got a wife,
kids, good job.

01:32:48.481 --> 01:32:51.984
About 10 minutes
into the conversation,

01:32:52.068 --> 01:32:53.319
the guy breaks down.

01:32:53.903 --> 01:32:55.655
You know,
couldn't stop crying.

01:32:57.281 --> 01:33:00.493
Said he could never figure out
why Father Talbot picked him.

01:33:02.828 --> 01:33:05.331
Father Talbot
coached the hockey team.

01:33:07.416 --> 01:33:08.668
So,

01:33:10.044 --> 01:33:11.462
I guess we just got lucky.

01:33:12.755 --> 01:33:14.507
You and me.

01:33:20.596 --> 01:33:22.265
Does Jack Dunn
work for the school?

01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:24.100
No, he's PR
for Boston College.

01:33:24.308 --> 01:33:26.018
They call him
when they need help.

01:33:26.185 --> 01:33:28.104
And Pete Conley?
Why was he there?

01:33:28.271 --> 01:33:29.272
Good question.

01:33:29.355 --> 01:33:31.315
Pete's a big alum,
but I called Bill directly,

01:33:31.399 --> 01:33:33.067
and I asked
for a sit-down.

01:33:33.150 --> 01:33:34.944
I never mentioned
anybody else.

01:33:36.445 --> 01:33:38.364
It's like everybody
already knows the story.

01:33:38.531 --> 01:33:39.740
Yeah.

01:33:39.824 --> 01:33:42.118
Except us.
And we work right there.

01:33:45.955 --> 01:33:47.373
Judge Volterra?
Yes.

01:33:47.540 --> 01:33:49.709
Hi, I'm Mike Rezendes
from <i>The Boston Globe.</i>

01:33:50.209 --> 01:33:51.419
Um, I'm having
some trouble

01:33:51.502 --> 01:33:52.628
accessing some
public records

01:33:52.795 --> 01:33:53.879
down in the
records room.

01:33:53.963 --> 01:33:56.215
I was wondering if I could
have a word with you?

01:33:56.299 --> 01:33:58.217
All right.
Thank you.

01:34:00.594 --> 01:34:01.595
Thank you very much.

01:34:03.222 --> 01:34:06.559
These exhibits you're after,
Mr. Rezendes,

01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:09.061
they're very
sensitive records.

01:34:09.895 --> 01:34:11.230
With all due respect,
Your Honor,

01:34:11.314 --> 01:34:13.232
that's not the question.

01:34:13.316 --> 01:34:14.567
The records are public.

01:34:15.901 --> 01:34:18.070
Maybe so, but tell me,

01:34:18.487 --> 01:34:20.406
where's the editorial
responsibility

01:34:20.531 --> 01:34:22.408
in publishing
records of this nature?

01:34:22.742 --> 01:34:26.871
Well, where's the editorial
responsibility in not publishing them?

01:34:36.881 --> 01:34:39.342
You can't take those.
You need to make copies.

01:34:39.425 --> 01:34:40.801
I'm going to the copy room.

01:34:40.885 --> 01:34:42.720
It closed at 4:00.

01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:48.976
Look, I'll give you

01:34:51.020 --> 01:34:52.730
83 bucks to use yours.

01:34:58.819 --> 01:35:01.322
Hey, cabbie!

01:35:01.405 --> 01:35:04.408
Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:35:07.036 --> 01:35:09.830
Take me to <i>The Boston Globe</i>
on Morrissey Boulevard.

01:35:09.914 --> 01:35:13.000
Don't take 93.
Take Dorchester Avenue.

01:35:14.752 --> 01:35:16.629
<i>Robby, it's incredible!</i>

01:35:16.837 --> 01:35:19.673
<i>Law knew about Geoghan for years,
no question.</i>

01:35:19.757 --> 01:35:22.676

01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:25.805

01:35:25.888 --> 01:35:27.223

"You know how grateful I am to
you for your constant concern.

01:36:19.775 --> 01:36:21.569
"Sincerely yours in our Lord,

01:36:21.652 --> 01:36:25.114
"Most Reverend John M. Darcy,
Auxiliary Bishop of Boston.

01:36:25.197 --> 01:36:26.740
"December 7, 1984."

01:36:26.824 --> 01:36:28.534
An auxiliary bishop
wrote that?

01:36:28.701 --> 01:36:30.077
That's incredible.

01:36:30.286 --> 01:36:31.328
He broke ranks.

01:36:31.412 --> 01:36:33.205
I mean,
when did Gallant write her letter?

01:36:33.289 --> 01:36:35.249
1984.
And Law just ignored it.

01:36:35.916 --> 01:36:37.585
How do you ignore
that freakin' letter?

01:36:37.835 --> 01:36:39.170
We got 'em.

01:36:39.378 --> 01:36:42.047
You can't read these letters and
think anything else. It's proof.

01:36:42.131 --> 01:36:43.883
Yeah. It is.

01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:46.302
This is good work.

01:36:46.886 --> 01:36:48.471
Should we
take it up to Ben?

01:36:49.180 --> 01:36:50.181
Uh...

01:36:50.264 --> 01:36:51.932
No. Not yet.

01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:55.686
Why not?
We got Law. This is it.

01:36:56.228 --> 01:36:57.980
No, this is Law
covering for one priest.

01:36:58.063 --> 01:36:59.356
There's another
90 out there.

01:36:59.690 --> 01:37:01.442
Yeah, and we'll print
that story when we get it,

01:37:01.525 --> 01:37:02.725
but we gotta go with this now.

01:37:03.152 --> 01:37:04.987
No, I'm not going to
rush this story, Mike.

01:37:05.070 --> 01:37:06.322
We don't have
a choice, Robby.

01:37:06.655 --> 01:37:08.073
If we don't rush to print,

01:37:08.157 --> 01:37:10.743
somebody else is gonna find these
letters and butcher the story.

01:37:10.826 --> 01:37:12.119
Joe Quimby from the <i>Herald</i>

01:37:12.203 --> 01:37:13.746
was at the
freakin' courthouse.

01:37:13.996 --> 01:37:15.581
So we'll write
a holding story,

01:37:15.664 --> 01:37:16.874
and we'll keep our
eye on the <i>Herald.</i>

01:37:16.957 --> 01:37:18.042
Keep our eye on the <i>Herald?</i>

01:37:18.125 --> 01:37:20.836
They run this and they get it wrong,
the Church will bury it.

01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:22.880
We gotta do this now.
Mike, Mike...

01:37:22.963 --> 01:37:25.382
What? Why are we hesitating?

01:37:25.466 --> 01:37:27.676
Baron told us to get Law.
This is Law.

01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:29.637
Baron told us to
get the system.

01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:31.305
We need the full scope.

01:37:31.388 --> 01:37:33.516
That's the only thing
that will put an end to this.

01:37:33.641 --> 01:37:35.401
Then let's take it up
to Ben, let him decide.

01:37:35.601 --> 01:37:37.353
We'll take it to Ben
when I say it's time.

01:37:37.436 --> 01:37:39.980
It's time, Robby. It's time!

01:37:41.273 --> 01:37:44.860
They knew and they
let it happen. To kids!

01:37:45.611 --> 01:37:48.113
Okay? It could've been you!
It could've been me!

01:37:48.197 --> 01:37:50.241
It could have been any of us!

01:37:51.033 --> 01:37:52.618
We gotta nail these scumbags!

01:37:52.701 --> 01:37:55.829
We gotta show people that
nobody can get away with this!

01:37:55.913 --> 01:37:59.250
Not a priest or a Cardinal
or a freaking Pope!

01:38:02.044 --> 01:38:03.087
You finished?

01:38:04.046 --> 01:38:06.882
Yeah, I am. This is bullshit.

01:38:27.027 --> 01:38:28.028
Oh...

01:38:36.662 --> 01:38:37.663
You okay?

01:38:40.666 --> 01:38:42.251
Mmm...

01:38:48.257 --> 01:38:49.300
Hey, Hansi.

01:38:50.134 --> 01:38:52.052
Hard day at work, Mike?

01:38:56.599 --> 01:38:58.183
Here.
Thank you.

01:38:59.059 --> 01:39:01.604
I don't know why
I got so pissed off.

01:39:01.687 --> 01:39:03.105
You know, I think
Robby's wrong.

01:39:03.188 --> 01:39:05.190
You know, you're just...

01:39:05.274 --> 01:39:06.942
You care about the story, Mike.
We all do.

01:39:08.986 --> 01:39:11.196
- Yeah, I guess.
- Mmm.

01:39:13.824 --> 01:39:15.909
I stopped going to
church with my Nana.

01:39:17.995 --> 01:39:19.580
It was...
It was too hard.

01:39:20.414 --> 01:39:22.374
You know,
I'd be sitting there,

01:39:22.541 --> 01:39:24.501
and I'd start thinking
about Joe Crowley

01:39:24.585 --> 01:39:26.211
or someone else and I just...

01:39:27.046 --> 01:39:28.255
I just got so angry.

01:39:29.632 --> 01:39:31.550
Did you tell her why?

01:39:32.968 --> 01:39:35.054
She goes to church
three times a week, Mike.

01:39:40.184 --> 01:39:42.186
It really pisses me off.

01:39:43.604 --> 01:39:44.605
You know,

01:39:46.565 --> 01:39:49.818
I actually really liked going to
church when I was a little kid.

01:39:50.778 --> 01:39:51.779
Mmm.

01:39:51.945 --> 01:39:53.280
Why'd you stop?

01:39:53.447 --> 01:39:54.782
Typical shit.

01:39:56.492 --> 01:39:58.619
But the weird thing is,

01:40:01.664 --> 01:40:03.248
I think I...

01:40:04.208 --> 01:40:08.587
I think I figured that maybe one day...

01:40:08.671 --> 01:40:10.714
I would actually go back.

01:40:12.675 --> 01:40:14.927
I was really...
I was holding on to that.

01:40:15.010 --> 01:40:16.011
Mmm.

01:40:17.429 --> 01:40:20.265
I read those letters, and...

01:40:21.100 --> 01:40:24.603
And something just cracked.

01:40:26.188 --> 01:40:28.357
It's a shitty feeling.
Yeah.

01:40:29.775 --> 01:40:31.985
It's a shitty feeling.

01:40:35.447 --> 01:40:37.116
Looks like a long day.

01:40:37.241 --> 01:40:39.535
Hey, Pete.
I'm sorry to make it longer.

01:40:39.618 --> 01:40:40.994
Brian.

01:40:42.162 --> 01:40:44.498
Has anyone ever said no
to a drink with you, Pete?

01:40:45.958 --> 01:40:49.461
Well, sure.
But the trick is to keep asking.

01:40:49.712 --> 01:40:50.796
For Boston.

01:40:50.921 --> 01:40:51.964
Boston.

01:40:53.340 --> 01:40:54.341
Mmm.

01:40:54.883 --> 01:40:57.886
So, you here
for the Cardinal?

01:40:58.220 --> 01:41:00.514
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I wouldn't...

01:41:00.597 --> 01:41:03.183
I wouldn't presume to speak
for the Cardinal. No.

01:41:04.977 --> 01:41:06.395
You know,

01:41:06.478 --> 01:41:08.564
you got a lot of people here
who respect you, Robby,

01:41:08.731 --> 01:41:10.524
the work you do.

01:41:11.316 --> 01:41:12.735
That's good to know.

01:41:12.818 --> 01:41:14.570
You know, it's because you
care about this place.

01:41:14.653 --> 01:41:16.655
It's why you do what you do.
It's who you are.

01:41:17.865 --> 01:41:21.243
You know,
but people need the Church,

01:41:21.326 --> 01:41:22.536
more than ever right now.

01:41:23.370 --> 01:41:24.997
You know, you can feel it.

01:41:25.581 --> 01:41:27.249
And the Cardinal...

01:41:28.667 --> 01:41:31.170
You know, the Cardinal,
he might not be perfect,

01:41:32.212 --> 01:41:33.630
but we can't
throw out all the good

01:41:33.714 --> 01:41:35.340
he's doing over
a few bad apples.

01:41:37.426 --> 01:41:39.094
Now, you know,
I'm bringing this up to you

01:41:39.261 --> 01:41:42.890
because I know this is
Baron's idea, his agenda.

01:41:43.265 --> 01:41:44.933
I gotta tell ya,
I mean, honest to God,

01:41:45.017 --> 01:41:47.770
I mean, he doesn't care about
this city the way we do.

01:41:48.437 --> 01:41:49.605
I mean, how could he?

01:41:56.570 --> 01:41:59.573
This is how it happens, isn't it, Pete?
What's that?

01:42:00.032 --> 01:42:01.575
A guy leans on a guy,

01:42:01.742 --> 01:42:03.702
and suddenly
the whole town

01:42:03.786 --> 01:42:05.370
just looks
the other way.

01:42:07.039 --> 01:42:10.125
Robby. Robby, look it,

01:42:11.543 --> 01:42:14.588
Marty Baron is just
trying to make his mark.

01:42:14.671 --> 01:42:17.299
He's gonna be here for a couple
of years, and he's gonna move on.

01:42:17.382 --> 01:42:19.760
Just like he did in
New York and Miami.

01:42:21.804 --> 01:42:23.639
Where're you gonna go?

01:42:25.307 --> 01:42:26.308
Hmm?

01:42:28.602 --> 01:42:30.729
Good night, Robby.
Brian.

01:42:32.064 --> 01:42:34.566
Hey, Pete.
Yeah?

01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:35.901
Uh...

01:42:36.693 --> 01:42:40.989
When we do run the story, uh, I'm gonna
need a comment from the Cardinal.

01:42:43.283 --> 01:42:45.744
We'll talk again later.
Good night, Robby.

01:42:45.911 --> 01:42:47.496
Good night, Pete.

01:42:57.798 --> 01:42:59.049
Robby.

01:43:00.592 --> 01:43:01.593
What?

01:43:02.594 --> 01:43:04.680
No shit. When?

01:43:06.682 --> 01:43:08.684
Okay. Yeah.

01:43:11.728 --> 01:43:12.938
Hey!

01:43:13.939 --> 01:43:15.274
What's up?

01:43:16.441 --> 01:43:18.235
Sweeney ruled
in our favor.

01:43:18.735 --> 01:43:20.737
She ruled to unseal
the documents.

01:43:22.489 --> 01:43:23.490
Jeez!

01:43:27.452 --> 01:43:28.972
The Church has already
filed an appeal,

01:43:29.121 --> 01:43:32.124
but the trial court ruling is
generally upheld in these matters.

01:43:32.791 --> 01:43:34.668
And when would we
get the documents?

01:43:35.669 --> 01:43:37.921
Probably takes Cohen
a few weeks to rule,

01:43:38.005 --> 01:43:39.381
then there's
a redaction process.

01:43:40.132 --> 01:43:43.385
Uh, I'd say they'd be
made public mid-January.

01:43:44.094 --> 01:43:45.304
Okay.
All right.

01:43:45.387 --> 01:43:46.471
Thanks, Jon.
You bet.

01:43:46.555 --> 01:43:47.764
Nice work.
Thanks.

01:43:48.432 --> 01:43:50.100
Metro should run
something, Marty.

01:43:50.559 --> 01:43:51.894
We can't run
this one big.

01:43:52.686 --> 01:43:55.480
Why wouldn't we?
It's a major First Amendment victory.

01:43:55.647 --> 01:43:56.732
Not to mention,
you get

01:43:56.815 --> 01:43:57.900
an Irish Catholic judge

01:43:58.066 --> 01:43:59.276
ruling against the Church?

01:43:59.443 --> 01:44:01.403
- That's a hell of a precedent.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:44:02.029 --> 01:44:04.072
We don't want the <i>Herald</i>
going deep on this.

01:44:04.907 --> 01:44:05.908
Why's that?

01:44:08.076 --> 01:44:10.203
You're gonna have
to step out, Peter.

01:44:10.287 --> 01:44:11.788
I'm not stepping out.

01:44:20.213 --> 01:44:21.214
Peter.

01:44:35.812 --> 01:44:37.773
When did you, uh...
A couple of weeks ago.

01:44:37.981 --> 01:44:39.483
A couple of weeks?

01:44:39.650 --> 01:44:41.234
- Yeah.
- And you're telling us now?

01:44:41.401 --> 01:44:42.986
These are substantial.

01:44:44.112 --> 01:44:46.365
They clearly show
that Law was negligent.

01:44:47.199 --> 01:44:49.618
I need more time.
I wanna keep digging.

01:44:49.993 --> 01:44:51.411
For what?
This is the goddamn story.

01:44:51.578 --> 01:44:52.663
It's not
the whole story.

01:44:52.829 --> 01:44:54.498
Tough shit.
We're on a clock now.

01:44:54.831 --> 01:44:55.999
Even if we don't
run Sweeney's ruling,

01:44:56.166 --> 01:44:58.293
another paper could find these
letters and fuck the story.

01:44:58.377 --> 01:44:59.461
Agreed.

01:44:59.544 --> 01:45:00.671
But we run
these letters alone,

01:45:00.754 --> 01:45:02.965
Law apologizes,
says it's a one-time thing.

01:45:03.048 --> 01:45:04.049
He can bury it.

01:45:04.257 --> 01:45:07.052
How? These clearly show he
knew and did nothing about it.

01:45:07.135 --> 01:45:10.222
Look, I'm close to
stories on 70 priests.

01:45:10.889 --> 01:45:13.475
We nail that,
along with those letters,

01:45:13.642 --> 01:45:16.395
this is proof
this is bigger than Law.

01:45:17.104 --> 01:45:18.563
It's the whole system.

01:45:19.523 --> 01:45:22.025
You have multiple sources
confirming all those priests?

01:45:22.859 --> 01:45:24.528
On some. I can get more.

01:45:24.736 --> 01:45:27.572
Too risky. If we're not buttoned
up on every single one of them,

01:45:27.739 --> 01:45:29.241
the Church will pick us apart.

01:45:31.118 --> 01:45:32.160
I think I can get us someone

01:45:32.244 --> 01:45:33.524
from the other
side of the aisle.

01:45:33.996 --> 01:45:35.580
Somebody inside the Church?

01:45:36.498 --> 01:45:37.666
Yeah, a lawyer.

01:45:38.166 --> 01:45:39.543
Will he go on the record?

01:45:39.626 --> 01:45:42.587
Deep background.
But he's a solid source.

01:45:46.383 --> 01:45:48.301
Rezendes needs time
to write the story.

01:45:48.927 --> 01:45:51.430
We don't wanna drop it at
Christmas, not after 9/11.

01:45:52.806 --> 01:45:54.516
We could run it
just after New Year's,

01:45:55.100 --> 01:45:57.310
before they release
the rest of the documents.

01:46:01.023 --> 01:46:02.024
All right.

01:46:03.191 --> 01:46:05.694
Tell Canellos to bury
the ruling in Metro.

01:46:07.571 --> 01:46:08.989
You got six weeks.

01:46:09.823 --> 01:46:11.408
Thank you.

01:46:11.783 --> 01:46:13.785
Tell Mike I want
a draft by Christmas.

01:46:14.369 --> 01:46:16.038
And we need a response
from Lake Street.

01:46:16.204 --> 01:46:18.415
Who does PR for the Cardinal?
Still John Walsh?

01:46:18.582 --> 01:46:20.125
No, somebody new,
Donna Morrisey.

01:46:20.208 --> 01:46:21.877
She came from TV.
She's young.

01:46:21.960 --> 01:46:23.045
Good, get a quote.

01:46:23.128 --> 01:46:24.755
We need something from Law
to appear even-handed.

01:46:24.921 --> 01:46:27.132
Robby, next time give
me a goddamn heads-up.

01:46:27.299 --> 01:46:28.508
Will do.

01:46:29.593 --> 01:46:35.474
<i>Silent night, holy night</i>

01:46:37.392 --> 01:46:40.270
<i>All is calm</i>

01:46:41.354 --> 01:46:43.482
<i>All is bright</i>

01:46:45.358 --> 01:46:51.907
<i>Round yon virgin,
mother and child</i>

01:46:53.408 --> 01:47:00.373
<i>Holy infant,
so tender and mild</i>

01:47:01.208 --> 01:47:06.421
<i>Sleep in heavenly peace</i>

01:47:08.590 --> 01:47:13.386
<i>Sleep in heavenly peace</i>

01:47:15.597 --> 01:47:21.853
<i>Silent night, holy night</i>

01:47:23.563 --> 01:47:26.858
<i>Shepherds quake</i>

01:47:27.359 --> 01:47:30.737
<i>At the sight</i>

01:47:31.363 --> 01:47:37.035
<i>Glory streams
from heaven above</i>

01:47:39.746 --> 01:47:45.085
<i>Heavenly hosts
sing Hallelujah</i>

01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:53.844
Oh, Robby.
What a nice surprise.

01:47:54.719 --> 01:47:56.221
Come on in.

01:48:02.727 --> 01:48:05.397
Hey, hon, look who
I found outside.

01:48:08.567 --> 01:48:09.818
Karen, can you
give us a minute?

01:48:12.154 --> 01:48:13.238
Sure.

01:48:13.864 --> 01:48:14.990
Good to see you, Karen.

01:48:18.076 --> 01:48:19.077
What's up?

01:48:34.593 --> 01:48:36.219
I'm out of time, Jim.

01:48:37.429 --> 01:48:40.223
We've got cover-up
stories on 70 priests,

01:48:40.682 --> 01:48:42.684
but the boss
isn't gonna run it

01:48:42.809 --> 01:48:44.853
unless I get confirmation
from your side.

01:48:47.063 --> 01:48:48.857
Are you out of your mind?

01:48:49.024 --> 01:48:51.276
Come on.
This is our town, Jimmy.

01:48:51.693 --> 01:48:55.447
Everybody knew something was going on,
and no one did a thing.

01:48:56.698 --> 01:48:57.738
We gotta put an end to it.

01:48:58.116 --> 01:49:00.118
Don't tell me
what I gotta do.

01:49:00.785 --> 01:49:03.622
Yeah, I helped defend these scumbags,
but that's my job, Robby.

01:49:03.872 --> 01:49:05.957
I was doing my job!

01:49:07.125 --> 01:49:08.126
Yeah.

01:49:09.461 --> 01:49:10.921
You and everyone else.

01:49:19.804 --> 01:49:21.306
Get out of my house.

01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:33.401
Hey!

01:49:35.487 --> 01:49:37.906
You come to my home
and lay this shit on me!

01:49:39.157 --> 01:49:40.492
You were right, Robby.

01:49:41.326 --> 01:49:43.453
We all knew somethin'
was going on.

01:49:44.162 --> 01:49:45.622
So where were you?

01:49:46.790 --> 01:49:48.333
What took you so long?

01:49:54.839 --> 01:49:56.675
I don't know, Jim.

01:50:01.554 --> 01:50:02.722
Give me the list.

01:50:59.487 --> 01:51:01.197
Larry, we're going
to press in six hours.

01:51:01.281 --> 01:51:02.324
Donna Morrisey
said she'd called us

01:51:02.407 --> 01:51:03.647
with a quote
from Law hours ago.

01:51:03.700 --> 01:51:05.702
That's what I thought.
When did you talk to her?

01:51:06.202 --> 01:51:07.537
Okay, okay, Larry.

01:51:08.204 --> 01:51:09.956
Yeah. Yeah, that's
good to know.

01:51:10.582 --> 01:51:12.334
Thanks, Pete.
Anything?

01:51:12.917 --> 01:51:15.757
Conley said Donna Morrisey should have
called, he just left Lake Street.

01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:17.839
Yeah, Rasky said
the same thing.

01:51:17.922 --> 01:51:19.924
This is ridiculous. You'd think
they'd wanna get ahead of this.

01:51:20.008 --> 01:51:21.634
I mean, they'd be
idiots not to.

01:51:22.260 --> 01:51:25.388
I would love to see their faces
when they read this thing then.

01:51:25.555 --> 01:51:27.557
You know, Sunday's the
feast of the Epiphany.

01:51:28.224 --> 01:51:30.435
It seems appropriate.

01:51:35.857 --> 01:51:36.858
Mike Rezendes.

01:51:38.818 --> 01:51:41.237
Hey, Donna.
Thanks for calling.

01:51:41.321 --> 01:51:44.282
Yeah, I just had a few questions
if you have a minute.

01:51:46.201 --> 01:51:47.202
What?

01:51:48.828 --> 01:51:50.997
What?
Another adjective.

01:51:52.832 --> 01:51:54.793
Anything?
Law just turned us down.

01:51:54.959 --> 01:51:56.294
Jesus Christ.

01:51:56.461 --> 01:51:58.004
I just got off the phone
with Donna Morrisey.

01:51:58.088 --> 01:52:00.423
She said, quote,
we don't even want to know

01:52:00.507 --> 01:52:01.827
what the questions are,
end quote.

01:52:01.966 --> 01:52:03.885
She really said that?
Yeah.

01:52:04.135 --> 01:52:05.136
Well, that oughta do it.

01:52:05.303 --> 01:52:06.679
"The Church
had no interest

01:52:06.846 --> 01:52:09.849
"in knowing what the <i>Globe's</i>
questions would be."

01:52:11.184 --> 01:52:13.520
Work it in somewhere before the jump.
Anything else?

01:52:13.978 --> 01:52:15.730
Uh, Matt wants to put
the letters online,

01:52:15.814 --> 01:52:17.315
so the readers can
see for themselves.

01:52:17.774 --> 01:52:19.776
We can run the URL at the
bottom of the article.

01:52:19.943 --> 01:52:21.736
It's pretty straightforward.
Okay.

01:52:21.903 --> 01:52:23.988
We also put the Spotlight tip
line at the end of the story

01:52:24.155 --> 01:52:25.365
so people can call in.

01:52:25.448 --> 01:52:26.741
Goes directly to our office.

01:52:26.991 --> 01:52:29.160
Matt and I can go in in the
morning in case we get any calls.

01:52:29.327 --> 01:52:31.487
Yeah, I'm more concerned about
the phones at reception.

01:52:31.579 --> 01:52:32.747
After we ran
the Porter case,

01:52:32.831 --> 01:52:34.666
the message centers
were tied up for weeks.

01:52:34.833 --> 01:52:36.673
It's a real problem.
There were picketers, too.

01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:38.044
Lots of 'em.

01:52:38.128 --> 01:52:40.547
I'll talk to Richard about
the security and the phones.

01:52:40.797 --> 01:52:43.216
Uh, how are we coming
on the folo story?

01:52:44.175 --> 01:52:45.593
Well, we've nailed
down multiple stories

01:52:45.677 --> 01:52:46.678
on 70 priests.

01:52:47.887 --> 01:52:49.180
- All 70?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:52:49.597 --> 01:52:52.157
And with the confirmation from
Robby's source, we're ready to go.

01:52:52.308 --> 01:52:53.468
We can have
a draft next week.

01:52:53.518 --> 01:52:56.104
Uh, Robby, that
source of yours,

01:52:56.187 --> 01:52:57.467
is it something
we could revisit?

01:52:59.983 --> 01:53:01.151
He might be tough.

01:53:01.234 --> 01:53:02.794
But he has no problem
helping the Church

01:53:02.902 --> 01:53:04.446
protect dozens
of dirty priests.

01:53:04.612 --> 01:53:07.240
Guy's a scumbag.
He's a lawyer, he's doing his job.

01:53:07.407 --> 01:53:08.533
He's a shill
for the Church.

01:53:08.700 --> 01:53:09.826
He knew
and did nothing.

01:53:09.993 --> 01:53:12.328
He could've said something years ago.
Maybe saved some lives.

01:53:12.412 --> 01:53:13.663
What about us?

01:53:15.123 --> 01:53:16.291
What's that
supposed to mean?

01:53:16.666 --> 01:53:18.793
We had all the pieces.

01:53:18.877 --> 01:53:19.997
Why didn't we get it sooner?

01:53:20.295 --> 01:53:21.296
We didn't have
all the pieces.

01:53:21.463 --> 01:53:24.466
We had Saviano,
we had Barrett, we had Geoghan.

01:53:24.549 --> 01:53:26.069
We had the directories
in the basement.

01:53:26.384 --> 01:53:27.504
You know what?
We got it now.

01:53:27.552 --> 01:53:29.637
Robby, the story
needed Spotlight.

01:53:30.472 --> 01:53:32.807
Mike, Spotlight's
been around since 1970.

01:53:33.057 --> 01:53:36.186
So what? We couldn't see the scope of this.
No one could.

01:53:36.269 --> 01:53:38.438
Robby, this started
with one goddamn priest.

01:53:41.232 --> 01:53:43.943
Macleish sent us a letter
on 20 priests, years ago.

01:53:44.110 --> 01:53:45.820
Sacha found the clip.

01:53:46.571 --> 01:53:48.031
You freaking kidding me?
20 priests?

01:53:48.656 --> 01:53:49.699
When?

01:53:51.242 --> 01:53:53.786
Uh, just after Porter.
December '93.

01:53:54.120 --> 01:53:56.372
We buried the story
in Metro. No folo.

01:53:57.790 --> 01:53:59.125
That was you.

01:54:01.127 --> 01:54:02.253
You were Metro.

01:54:03.421 --> 01:54:05.423
Yeah. That was me.

01:54:06.299 --> 01:54:08.718
I'd just taken over.
I don't remember it at all.

01:54:10.261 --> 01:54:11.596
But yeah...

01:54:15.099 --> 01:54:16.476
Um...

01:54:16.559 --> 01:54:19.062
Can I say something here?

01:54:20.730 --> 01:54:22.273
Sometimes it's
easy to forget

01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:25.193
that we spend most of our time
stumbling around in the dark.

01:54:26.361 --> 01:54:28.196
Suddenly a light
gets turned on,

01:54:28.279 --> 01:54:30.657
and there's a fair share
of blame to go around.

01:54:32.784 --> 01:54:35.078
I can't speak to what
happened before I arrived,

01:54:36.871 --> 01:54:39.541
but, um, all of you have done
some very good reporting here.

01:54:40.458 --> 01:54:43.461
Reporting that I believe
is gonna have an immediate

01:54:43.795 --> 01:54:46.798
and considerable
impact on our readers.

01:54:48.258 --> 01:54:51.511
For me, this kind of story
is why we do this.

01:54:52.262 --> 01:54:55.223
Having said that, Cardinal Law
and the Catholic community

01:54:55.390 --> 01:54:57.642
are gonna have a very
strong response to this.

01:54:58.977 --> 01:55:00.979
So if you need a moment,

01:55:02.021 --> 01:55:03.022
you've earned it.

01:55:05.358 --> 01:55:07.485
But I will need you
back here Monday morning

01:55:07.569 --> 01:55:10.989
focused and ready
to do your job.

01:55:19.205 --> 01:55:20.206
Leaving?

01:55:21.082 --> 01:55:22.083
Yeah.

01:55:27.839 --> 01:55:30.258
I, uh, just got a call
from the Cardinal.

01:55:30.675 --> 01:55:32.510
Really. Why?

01:55:32.594 --> 01:55:33.970
He wanted to
tell me personally

01:55:34.095 --> 01:55:35.430
that he decided
not to comment.

01:55:36.180 --> 01:55:40.685
Yeah, said he wanted to
extend me that courtesy.

01:55:40.852 --> 01:55:43.605
Jesus, the balls on that guy.
What did you say?

01:55:44.355 --> 01:55:45.982
I told him he was
making a mistake,

01:55:46.065 --> 01:55:47.734
and that we were
gonna run the story.

01:55:47.900 --> 01:55:49.527
Damn right we're
gonna run it.

01:56:14.552 --> 01:56:16.429
Sacha, can I have
a drink of water?

01:56:17.639 --> 01:56:20.016
Yeah. Sure, Nana. Yeah.

01:56:31.277 --> 01:56:32.612
Can I keep this?

01:56:34.113 --> 01:56:35.239
Sure.

01:56:36.074 --> 01:56:37.825
I thought you
should see it first.

01:56:37.950 --> 01:56:39.452
Thank you for
bringing it by.

01:56:42.413 --> 01:56:44.916
I have some clients
I have to attend to.

01:57:02.975 --> 01:57:04.644
Both kids were abused.

01:57:05.186 --> 01:57:07.188
Jamaica Plain.
Two weeks ago.

01:57:09.190 --> 01:57:12.860
Keep doing your work,
Mr. Rezendes.

01:57:14.779 --> 01:57:16.614
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:57:16.781 --> 01:57:19.200
How are you guys doing?
We're good.

01:57:19.659 --> 01:57:20.660
Good.

01:58:07.540 --> 01:58:09.542
Hey.
Morning.

01:58:10.293 --> 01:58:11.461
How'd you sleep?

01:58:12.295 --> 01:58:13.838
Not very well. You?

01:58:14.046 --> 01:58:15.882
I haven't slept well for months.
Mmm.

01:58:17.508 --> 01:58:19.886
Oh, thanks.
I actually started writing.

01:58:20.678 --> 01:58:22.805
Writing?
Yeah, I've been working on a book.

01:58:22.889 --> 01:58:24.682
Gives me something
else to focus on.

01:58:24.849 --> 01:58:26.058
What kind of book?

01:58:26.350 --> 01:58:27.894
Horror.

01:58:34.692 --> 01:58:35.735
Spotlight.

01:58:37.153 --> 01:58:39.447
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.

01:58:39.530 --> 01:58:40.990
Can I get your
name, please?

01:58:57.673 --> 01:58:59.091
You do know
it's Sunday, right?

01:58:59.258 --> 01:59:00.885
I couldn't get
a tee time.

01:59:03.888 --> 01:59:05.765
No picketers.
Yeah.

01:59:06.390 --> 01:59:08.184
Probably still at church.

01:59:10.561 --> 01:59:11.938
Hey, Linda.

01:59:12.188 --> 01:59:13.272
It's quiet, huh?

01:59:13.356 --> 01:59:15.775
Yeah, easiest
overtime I ever made.

01:59:15.858 --> 01:59:16.901
Phone hasn't rung once.

01:59:17.401 --> 01:59:19.445
Marty sent two of mine
down to Spotlight.

01:59:23.241 --> 01:59:25.076
- Great article, guys.
- Thank you.

01:59:25.743 --> 01:59:26.911
Spotlight?

01:59:50.476 --> 01:59:52.186
Okay. Send him over.

01:59:52.270 --> 01:59:53.396
Spotlight,
can I help you?

01:59:53.479 --> 01:59:54.939
Phones have been
ringing all morning.

01:59:57.775 --> 01:59:59.402
Mike, can you grab that?
Yeah, yeah.

02:00:00.736 --> 02:00:02.738
They're almost
all victims, Robby.

02:00:05.157 --> 02:00:06.659
I'm sorry
to make you wait.

02:00:09.996 --> 02:00:11.330
It's very tough to
talk about, I know...

02:00:11.497 --> 02:00:13.082
Yes, you can
reach me here...
