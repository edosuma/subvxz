WEBVTT

00:00.395 --> 00:02.668
Hey, what's with you and Ferguson?

00:02.703 --> 00:06.207
Governor's pet. Maybe she fancies
a bit of black velvet.

00:07.791 --> 00:10.503
The women hate me.
It's because you're special.

00:10.628 --> 00:13.798
I'm scared.
I promised you. I'll protect you.

00:15.651 --> 00:19.344
Hey. You've got my back?
Yeah. Thanks.

00:19.506 --> 00:24.402
What's with you and Franky, huh? Are you fucking?
During the riot, when I was held hostage,

00:24.522 --> 00:27.695
did the Governor refuse
to open the doors to isolation? Yes.

00:28.819 --> 00:31.589
You had an hallucinogenic
in your system.

00:31.709 --> 00:35.040
That man must have drugged me.
The man that works for Ferguson.

00:35.122 --> 00:36.807
If you keep acting like that...

00:36.927 --> 00:40.059
For fuck's sake! No,
you are not my mum! You're a lag

00:40.129 --> 00:41.615
and an alcoholic.

00:41.693 --> 00:43.700
I'm Kaz. The inspiration you

00:43.820 --> 00:46.350
have been to so many women.
When you go out there and you

00:46.470 --> 00:49.201
commit crimes in my name,
it doesn't exactly help me.

00:49.281 --> 00:50.846
I'm telling you to stop.

00:50.966 --> 00:53.457
You're a good person, Franky.
I'm not a good person!

00:53.576 --> 00:55.181
Yes, you are.
You're not a murderer.

00:55.301 --> 00:57.529
You don't know shit!
I know you're not a killer.

00:57.562 --> 00:59.677
Yes, I am!
Oh, yeah? Who've you killed?

00:59.731 --> 01:01.565
I fucking killed Meg Jackson!

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074

03:02.034 --> 03:03.681
What's the matter with you?

03:21.465 --> 03:25.237
Oh, my Nash. Oh, he'd do anything
to make me feel better.

03:25.357 --> 03:29.613
It's just an added bonus that
he has the most beautiful eyes,

03:29.693 --> 03:31.860
and gorgeous smile

03:31.942 --> 03:34.150
and enormous...

03:35.674 --> 03:37.521
Feet! I meant feet!

03:37.683 --> 03:42.498
It's a shame he's not here, but, cos
he'd help me with my cravings, for sure.

03:44.990 --> 03:46.031
Thank you, Doreen.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.307
Very interesting cravings.
But good listening, Jess.

03:48.388 --> 03:50.307
That's fantastic. Right.

03:50.318 --> 03:52.845
Who wants to go next? Maxine?
You can choose your own topic.

03:52.926 --> 03:54.974
My life without a cock.

03:57.261 --> 04:00.193
Perhaps we can entice Bea
to join in as your partner.

04:00.273 --> 04:02.401
Not me. No, I pass.

04:02.422 --> 04:04.366
No, you find someone else.
Alright. Liz, how about you

04:04.447 --> 04:06.013
and Sophie have a go?

04:06.094 --> 04:08.623
Nah. I'll get up with Franky.

04:08.743 --> 04:11.432
No. I'm right, kiddo.
Why don't you go with your Mum?

04:11.513 --> 04:13.320
No, I'm not going with her.

04:14.122 --> 04:15.164
I'll have a go.

04:15.245 --> 04:18.296
Whoa, legs akimbo!

04:18.416 --> 04:20.946
Here we go!
Who's going to be your arms, Kim?

04:23.435 --> 04:25.764
Boom-Booms!
Boomer!

04:30.783 --> 04:34.635
What? Oh, I haven't even
started yet! Fuck ya!

04:34.756 --> 04:38.528
OK. Your topic, Kim.
"My first day of freedom."

04:38.609 --> 04:40.296
Hey.

04:40.417 --> 04:43.307
My name's Kim.
Hi, Kim! Hi!

04:43.388 --> 04:45.955
When I get out of here,

04:46.075 --> 04:49.528
first thing I'm not going to do
is reoffend.

04:51.735 --> 04:56.352
Last time I did that to be with the woman
I love, the bitch had moved on.

04:56.432 --> 04:58.280
Oooh!

04:58.400 --> 05:03.176
She's screwing some skinny-arsed
scrag in fancy fucking clothes.

05:16.785 --> 05:18.633
Franky Doyle.

05:18.753 --> 05:22.044
Her parole hearing is
in a matter of weeks.

05:22.164 --> 05:25.979
No doubt you are aware of the rumours
that have been circulating.

05:26.100 --> 05:29.391
I pay no attention
to gossip, Governor.

05:29.551 --> 05:32.844
As a rule, neither do I. But when it comes
to incorrect relations between staff

05:32.964 --> 05:34.931
and prisoners,
I can't afford to ignore it.

05:35.012 --> 05:36.256
There's no truth to it.

05:38.022 --> 05:41.353
I'm merely concerned that Doyle
might be exploiting this

05:41.434 --> 05:43.641
to influence your report on her.

05:43.801 --> 05:49.222
I'm confident she won't. Franky Doyle has a
habit of doing things you least expect.

05:49.300 --> 05:50.827
She is...

05:52.153 --> 05:55.846
she is far too emotional
for her own good.

05:55.966 --> 05:58.736
Oh, well. Better a surfeit
than a deficit.

06:00.462 --> 06:02.749
What does that mean?

06:02.870 --> 06:07.287
Well, a deficit of emotion,
particularly a lack of affective

06:07.407 --> 06:09.575
empathy, would make
you psychopathic.

06:12.225 --> 06:16.720
But that's not Franky.
She uses empathy to her advantage.

06:18.086 --> 06:22.339
You think so? And people are drawn
to her because of it.

06:22.862 --> 06:25.712
And does that include you?

06:25.833 --> 06:28.241
I think I've answered
that question, Governor.

06:31.653 --> 06:33.500
Is that all?
Mm.

06:36.271 --> 06:40.727
Oh, just out of interest, have you
made any breakthroughs with Doyle?

06:40.847 --> 06:44.659
Breakthroughs?
No insights to report?

06:44.740 --> 06:46.788
My sessions are confidential.

06:46.909 --> 06:49.758
No, I'm just asking if you've
learnt anything that might preclude

06:49.837 --> 06:52.408
your recommending her release?

06:53.572 --> 06:56.863
Franky is ready
and deserving of parole.

06:56.984 --> 07:00.475
Anyone in my position would make
the same recommendation.

07:19.384 --> 07:22.555
Mr Jackson? This is my place of
work, Detective.

07:22.636 --> 07:24.601
Won't take long.

07:24.682 --> 07:27.011
Do you know who this is?

07:29.860 --> 07:31.868
No. Should I?

07:31.988 --> 07:34.759
Well, I got it off your
laptop's internet history.

07:34.840 --> 07:36.685
So what? It's in the news.

07:36.805 --> 07:40.217
This vigilante group's been targeting
men, mostly abusive husbands.

07:40.340 --> 07:44.153
Men like Harry Smith. I mean, it's
not a huge leap, given Bea Smith's

07:44.273 --> 07:46.762
their hero, that they had something
to do with Harry's murder, is it?

07:46.922 --> 07:51.739
What's your point? You, Bea Smith, the Red
Right Hand. Maybe you planned it together.

07:51.820 --> 07:53.867
You're joking, right?

07:58.154 --> 08:00.362
I want my fuckin' laptop back.

08:05.783 --> 08:07.792
Thanks, Vinnie.
Have a nice day, mate.

08:07.873 --> 08:10.401
Who's the delivery for?

08:10.522 --> 08:12.731
The Governor.
New roster.

08:13.615 --> 08:16.305
Starting tomorrow...
I've put you on General.

08:18.394 --> 08:20.563
I'm not ready yet, Vera.

08:20.683 --> 08:23.577
Don't worry.
We'll ease you back in.

08:53.213 --> 08:55.745
Beautiful.
Victor's got another hand...

08:55.824 --> 08:57.630
What's going on?

08:57.712 --> 09:00.121
What's it look like? I'm moving in.

09:00.241 --> 09:05.263
Why? Well, I can't help take care
of Dor's bub from H4 now, can I?

09:07.232 --> 09:09.518
Oh, Dor.
Oh, I can't stop. I gotta pee.

09:09.639 --> 09:11.948
Well, they're putting me in there,
but I reckon I should be

09:11.969 --> 09:13.516
in here with you because
you've got a spare bunk.

09:13.536 --> 09:16.548
Oh, that's sweet,
but that's close enough.

09:19.679 --> 09:23.336
Well, I've spread the word...
Uh-huh.

09:23.456 --> 09:25.343
..and I want to give
you a baby shower.

09:25.463 --> 09:27.271
Oh, no.
That's too much trouble, Jess.

09:27.392 --> 09:31.567
But you deserve it.
Oh, yes. Oh, sweet Jesus.

09:31.647 --> 09:33.335
All I do is pee.

09:33.455 --> 09:38.035
I swear this baby's sitting
right on my bladder, true.

09:38.155 --> 09:40.441
You look really tired.
Yeah.

09:40.523 --> 09:42.651
I gotta lay down before work unit.

09:42.733 --> 09:44.260
My back's killin' me.

09:44.380 --> 09:47.673
And I've got this craving
for choc-chip ice cream.

09:47.793 --> 09:50.565
It's driving me crazy.
All yours, Warner.

09:50.644 --> 09:54.821
Miss Miles, can we get some
choc-chip ice cream for Doreen?

09:54.903 --> 09:57.513
Yeah, I'll just ring Mr Whippy.

10:02.051 --> 10:07.593
Excuse me, Governor? Ms Ferguson,
can I please talk to you about Doreen?

10:07.713 --> 10:10.042
See, she's got a really sore back
because the mattress

10:10.123 --> 10:11.487
she's sleeping on is too thin,

10:11.607 --> 10:14.780
so I was hoping that maybe you could
organise a better one for her.

10:14.941 --> 10:18.917
And maybe you can get her some choc-chip
ice cream because she's having cravings.

10:18.999 --> 10:20.886
I'll pay for it.

10:25.545 --> 10:28.435
Oh, come on.
What's the matter with you?

10:39.922 --> 10:42.132
Sophie. Come here.

10:44.861 --> 10:47.312
Why don't you go help
your mum out with the towels, hon?

10:47.433 --> 10:49.683
But...
Just go do it.

11:00.122 --> 11:01.568
You're still pissed.

11:01.648 --> 11:03.297
Excuse me.

11:03.417 --> 11:06.509
I'm off the grog. I haven't
had a drink in over a week.

11:06.668 --> 11:09.801
Well, what do you want, a fucking medal?
How about a bit of understanding?

11:09.921 --> 11:12.171
I understand you're a drunk.
Yeah, and you're

11:12.292 --> 11:16.186
a drunk driver who killed
some guy on his fucking bike!

11:16.306 --> 11:17.995
Hey, Liz.
What?

11:19.496 --> 11:21.103
I'm not working with her.

11:21.184 --> 11:22.629
Good.

11:30.745 --> 11:31.811
Hey.

11:35.284 --> 11:37.253
Hey, Liz. Hey.

11:38.942 --> 11:41.111
You know, you're not
a nice person when you drink.

11:41.191 --> 11:43.199
Yeah, well, I'm off it.

11:43.319 --> 11:46.052
Yeah? Well, that's only cos
Maxine chucked it out.

11:46.133 --> 11:47.659
It was a relapse, Bea.

11:47.780 --> 11:50.351
Yeah, exactly.
You get your hands on more booze

11:50.472 --> 11:52.884
and you'll have another one.
Oh, and you'd know.

11:53.005 --> 11:55.374
Yeah, I do actually.
I've seen how ugly it can get.

11:55.453 --> 11:58.105
My Dad, he was a pisshead.

11:58.226 --> 12:00.514
His whole life was just
one relapse after another.

12:00.634 --> 12:02.484
Yeah. Well, Bea,
I'm not your old man.

12:02.565 --> 12:04.855
But you're a drunk like he was.

12:05.938 --> 12:10.319
Well, I might be a drunk, but
at least I'm not a fucking psycho.

12:12.970 --> 12:15.219
You make things
right with Sophie, OK?

12:15.341 --> 12:17.630
Because if she challenges
my authority again,

12:17.710 --> 12:20.363
I'll rain a shit storm down on her.

12:28.398 --> 12:29.763
Yep.

12:31.009 --> 12:33.501
Come in.
You wanted to see me, Gidget?

12:33.581 --> 12:35.952
You can leave the door open.

12:41.494 --> 12:43.946
Um, Franky...

12:44.026 --> 12:46.437
Um, Gidget?

12:46.558 --> 12:50.493
There is an external psych that
comes into the prison on a Tuesday

12:50.615 --> 12:52.946
and he sees a couple of
the women in the Protection Unit.

12:53.067 --> 12:58.209
He's very experienced and I've asked
him to complete your program.

12:58.370 --> 13:03.914
I'll then liaise with him in the writing of
your report for the Parole Board.

13:04.034 --> 13:08.374
These rumours aren't going away.
Is that why the door's open?

13:08.495 --> 13:10.262
So no-one thinks we're
in here going bumper to bumper?

13:10.383 --> 13:14.078
Fuckin' hell, Franky.
We're living in a fishbowl.

13:14.198 --> 13:17.333
The Parole Board get wind of it,
they are going to question every

13:17.453 --> 13:21.309
recommendation that I make.
This is in your best interests.

13:21.429 --> 13:25.930
This is not about my interests.
This isn't even about the rumours.

13:26.010 --> 13:27.818
This is about what I told you.

13:27.939 --> 13:30.068
No, it's got nothing
to do with that.

13:30.228 --> 13:33.564
It's got everything to do with that. You
pushed and pushed for me to open up and now

13:33.604 --> 13:37.379
that I have, you don't know
what the fuck to do with me.

13:37.500 --> 13:41.156
Ah, sorry. I can come back.
Nah. Don't worry about it.

13:42.040 --> 13:44.089
We're done.

13:46.548 --> 13:48.557
Do you do hypnosis?

14:04.916 --> 14:06.806
You were distracted today.

14:06.928 --> 14:10.303
Your body was here
but your mind wasn't.

14:10.383 --> 14:13.399
Do you think there might be

14:14.562 --> 14:18.263
a deficit in me
that needs correcting?

14:18.343 --> 14:19.548
I mean,

14:20.554 --> 14:23.448
do you think there
might be something

14:23.528 --> 14:25.780
wrong with me?

14:27.827 --> 14:30.925
I mean, you've always
taught me that to know your enemy,

14:31.045 --> 14:36.350
you must get inside their skin.
Become your enemy.

14:39.927 --> 14:42.219
But if your enemy feels?

14:42.299 --> 14:44.389
Is emotional?

14:44.469 --> 14:46.078
Then it's their weakness.

14:46.198 --> 14:50.139
It is a great advantage
not to be hampered by emotions.

14:54.196 --> 14:56.648
Emotion leads to mistakes.

16:12.943 --> 16:16.562
Anderson, come with me.
What time is it?

16:43.892 --> 16:44.921
Come on over.

16:52.495 --> 16:54.907
Come on. I won't bite.

17:00.054 --> 17:03.669
Not long now, hmm?
Only a few weeks. Mm.

17:15.287 --> 17:16.733
Ice cream.

17:17.667 --> 17:19.396
Choc chip.

17:22.334 --> 17:23.780
For real?

17:23.859 --> 17:25.630
For real.

17:30.095 --> 17:33.795
Wait. What have I got to do for it?
What's the catch?

17:33.915 --> 17:37.213
No catch.
Just eat it.

17:38.098 --> 17:39.828
As much as you want.

17:44.450 --> 17:47.347
Oh, yum.

17:52.737 --> 17:57.039
Mm. Oh, God. Mmm.

17:58.326 --> 18:02.266
Good? Mm.
Oh, that is better than good.

18:02.347 --> 18:04.479
That's bloody awesome.

18:05.685 --> 18:09.990
Shit, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to swear.

18:10.069 --> 18:12.723
Don't worry about it.

18:12.843 --> 18:15.538
Just as long as
you enjoy it, Jianna.

18:15.618 --> 18:17.147
That's all that matters.

18:33.712 --> 18:39.086
Jianna? So she called you Jianna?
Yeah.

18:39.095 --> 18:41.975
Which was weird.
I mean, like, weirder than normal,

18:41.998 --> 18:44.412
and that's saying something.
Well, who's Jianna?

18:44.483 --> 18:47.047
Well, I don't know,
but I wasn't going to ask, was I?

18:47.057 --> 18:50.196
Well, you should have.
New mattress for you, Anderson.

18:50.277 --> 18:52.652
Pressies for the Governor's pet.

18:52.773 --> 18:55.750
Dor, I got it for you.
I asked Ms Ferguson.

18:56.232 --> 18:59.936
Oh, thanks, Jess. You're awesome.
I don't even have a mattress.

19:00.057 --> 19:02.271
Not since mine got
burnt in the riot.

19:02.392 --> 19:06.053
You offered it up, Luce. Yeah,
well maybe I need to get knocked up.

19:06.135 --> 19:07.702
Would you do the honours, Max?

19:07.824 --> 19:10.681
Just whack off in a sandwich bag,
mate. I'll do the rest.

19:10.802 --> 19:13.865
Oh, you're sick!
It wouldn't even work for you.

19:13.985 --> 19:16.155
The Governor likes Dor.
Everyone knows that.

19:16.275 --> 19:18.811
Yeah, maybe they're
sharing more than recipes.

19:18.931 --> 19:21.428
Hey, what was that?
You're opening something for her.

19:21.510 --> 19:23.601
It's either your legs or your gob.

19:23.722 --> 19:26.100
Or Ferguson's the father
of your bastard child.

19:26.261 --> 19:29.197
Why don't you just shut your mouth, you
fat, ugly, old bull dyke? You and your...

19:29.318 --> 19:31.773
You fuckin' watch it!
You and your mate!

19:31.935 --> 19:34.711
You just watch what you're fuckin' saying!
Yeah, alright, alright.

19:34.833 --> 19:39.381
Alright, alright. Ya mongrel.
Disappear.

19:40.871 --> 19:42.921
Change her bed.
Put the old mattress out here.

19:43.044 --> 19:45.136
I'll organise someone
to pick it up, please.

19:45.218 --> 19:47.310
I'll make it for you, Dor.

19:47.430 --> 19:52.540
I'll do it.
You OK, love? You right? Yeah...

19:52.622 --> 19:54.112
You alright? Yeah.

19:54.233 --> 19:59.506
Hey, uh, I need you to find out
who this Jianna is, OK?

19:59.627 --> 20:02.442
And what she means to Ferguson.
Why?

20:02.522 --> 20:04.939
I just... I just need you to, alright?

20:07.234 --> 20:08.923
OK. Good.

20:18.382 --> 20:20.553
Why is that goldfish still here?

20:21.401 --> 20:24.139
I like looking at it.
Ferguson won't be happy.

20:28.205 --> 20:29.693
Nice fish.

20:31.060 --> 20:34.683
Here to see Bea Smith.
Mr Fletcher?

20:34.765 --> 20:36.776
What are you doing here?

20:36.855 --> 20:39.112
You're rostered in H Block.

20:49.939 --> 20:51.186
Hi.

20:53.120 --> 20:55.211
I was surprised to get your call.

20:55.333 --> 20:57.184
The last meeting didn't
quite go as I hoped.

20:57.264 --> 20:59.036
Yeah, well,

20:59.155 --> 21:03.583
I was pretty angry about the whole
Red Right Hand thing.

21:05.234 --> 21:08.493
I've got nothing to do
with this Red Right Hand.

21:09.581 --> 21:11.432
Yeah, OK.

21:11.552 --> 21:16.264
But I was wrong. And what I said,
what you're doing, it's important.

21:18.357 --> 21:21.454
If the system can't protect
women like me,

21:21.536 --> 21:24.432
then someone has to, right?

21:24.513 --> 21:25.841
You've changed your tune.

21:28.136 --> 21:32.683
Kaz, when I shot Brayden Holt,
I wasn't thinking about whether

21:32.763 --> 21:34.415
it was the right thing to do or not.

21:34.535 --> 21:38.719
I just, I was eaten up by hate.
I wanted him to die like a dog.

21:38.842 --> 21:42.988
Well, he deserved it.
What you did was righteous. No.

21:43.070 --> 21:45.603
No. It didn't change a thing.

21:45.725 --> 21:48.944
But what you're doing,
it does make a difference.

21:50.597 --> 21:53.253
Right? It makes a big difference.

21:57.478 --> 22:01.786
Sorry. This, um, you've no idea
what that means to me.

22:04.080 --> 22:06.333
You inspired us, Bea.

22:08.668 --> 22:11.688
Hey, I need you to do me a favour.
Anything.

22:11.768 --> 22:15.831
OK. In my hand is a sketch of a man.

22:15.912 --> 22:18.204
I need you to find out who he is.

22:20.060 --> 22:22.151
From a sketch?
Mm-hm.

22:22.231 --> 22:23.842
It's the best I can do, alright?

22:23.961 --> 22:26.095
Now, you said you had some
contacts in the cops, yeah?

22:26.216 --> 22:30.684
Now, it's possible that he comes
into the prison from time to time.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.301
Oh.

22:34.467 --> 22:37.363
What's he done?
He bashes women.

22:38.049 --> 22:40.102
Did he bash you?

22:42.678 --> 22:44.771
I'll find the bastard.

22:46.341 --> 22:48.231
And when I do...

22:49.439 --> 22:53.707
When you do,
you've gotta tell me first, OK?

22:55.155 --> 22:56.807
And then he's all yours.

23:14.314 --> 23:17.088
Get out.
Just a minute, that's all.

23:26.251 --> 23:30.027
The other week when you gave me
a serve, I reacted badly.

23:31.194 --> 23:33.804
I deserved it.

23:33.885 --> 23:36.537
And everything you said was true.

23:36.619 --> 23:38.706
I am a lagger,

23:38.827 --> 23:44.373
and I am a drunk. And I can
cop hearing that from Boomer,

23:44.493 --> 23:49.115
but when I heard it from you,
I just felt a little bit lost.

23:49.237 --> 23:53.293
That's when I started to drink.
So it's my fault? No.

23:53.374 --> 23:55.906
No, that's not what I'm saying.

23:57.432 --> 24:02.617
When you came in here with me, I just saw
it as a bit of a second chance for us.

24:02.697 --> 24:03.862
For me.

24:05.752 --> 24:08.805
To be the mum I never was to you.

24:15.957 --> 24:17.888
As a kid,

24:18.008 --> 24:22.025
I'd come from school every day
praying you weren't drunk.

24:22.145 --> 24:25.118
Oh, God. Sophie...
No, listen.

24:25.240 --> 24:28.455
I'd walk through the front door
and see you,

24:28.535 --> 24:31.590
and when you hadn't had a drink,

24:32.675 --> 24:33.720
God,

24:33.799 --> 24:36.130
I'd be so happy.

24:37.736 --> 24:40.110
But I knew it wasn't going to last.

24:40.189 --> 24:42.160
And it never did.

24:43.364 --> 24:47.984
I always knew that another time
soon I'd walk through that door

24:48.064 --> 24:50.719
and I'd see that look on your face.

24:51.881 --> 24:54.053
And I just knew.

24:58.433 --> 25:00.320
I am so sorry.

25:02.049 --> 25:05.506
I loved you when you were sober,

25:05.586 --> 25:07.875
cos that's when you were my Mum.

25:09.926 --> 25:13.864
But I hated you
when you were drunk.

25:33.794 --> 25:35.966
From now on,
I'm gonna stand back,

25:36.044 --> 25:39.138
and you can do whatever you want.

25:39.259 --> 25:43.158
But any time you need me,
I'll be here.

25:56.702 --> 25:59.272
I told you yesterday, Matt,
I don't do hypnosis.

25:59.392 --> 26:02.567
I'm not that sort of shrink.
So what do you do?

26:02.649 --> 26:05.741
Mostly, I listen. To the women.

26:05.901 --> 26:11.689
I'm not here to treat staff.
I think I used to be a bit of a bastard.

26:13.536 --> 26:15.063
Before the accident.

26:19.525 --> 26:21.252
And now you're not?

26:23.380 --> 26:28.647
I just, um, who I was then and
who I am now, I can't connect them.

26:30.457 --> 26:32.985
I've been getting these,
um, flashes.

26:33.106 --> 26:34.915
I'm not sure
if they're memories, or...

26:35.037 --> 26:38.331
They could be memories. You've
lost time because of the accident.

26:38.410 --> 26:39.937
Your brain's trying to find it.

26:40.019 --> 26:42.187
So you can't hypnotise me, then?

26:42.308 --> 26:45.806
Do you want to try
a little relaxation technique?

26:45.885 --> 26:47.653
See if that helps?

26:48.779 --> 26:49.845
OK.

26:53.030 --> 26:54.077
Yes.

26:56.488 --> 27:01.030
Ah, this arrived for you yesterday.
Must have got held up in reception.

27:01.110 --> 27:02.838
It's a fish.

27:08.106 --> 27:10.037
Matthew Fletcher.

27:10.157 --> 27:13.169
Why is he back in General?
I think he's ready.

27:13.250 --> 27:14.940
Really?

27:15.060 --> 27:17.511
You didn't think to
discuss it with me first?

27:17.591 --> 27:19.523
Staff roster is my responsibility.

27:19.683 --> 27:23.903
It's my opinion that he's ready to be
reintegrated into the normal work routine.

27:24.024 --> 27:27.882
What's going on here?
What's the matter?

27:27.962 --> 27:30.333
I'm sensing some tension.

27:30.455 --> 27:36.124
We cannot be an effective team, Vera,
if you put up barriers between us.

27:36.204 --> 27:39.663
Team? Is that what we are?

27:42.957 --> 27:44.969
Dinner. Tonight. My house.

27:45.089 --> 27:47.663
Excuse me?
What, you have other plans?

27:47.742 --> 27:49.188
7:00.

27:49.267 --> 27:51.240
Bring a bottle of something nice.

27:52.649 --> 27:55.904
Red. Shiraz.
That'd be good. I have vodka.

27:59.519 --> 28:00.648
That's all.

28:19.821 --> 28:21.671
I remember.

28:29.065 --> 28:31.843
His shoes had buckles.

28:33.330 --> 28:35.299
What does that mean to you?

28:43.380 --> 28:45.269
Oh, Matt?
Um, ah...

28:47.961 --> 28:50.615
Sorry, I've gotta go.

28:51.420 --> 28:56.163
Hey. Hang on! Hang on, Matt!
Matt. Come back. Hey!

28:56.284 --> 28:58.857
Better watch it.
People might think you

28:58.976 --> 29:01.350
and knuckle nuts are screwing.
What are you doing here?

29:01.470 --> 29:04.123
I don't want to see the other bloke.
I want to see you.

29:04.243 --> 29:06.776
Our appointments have
been cancelled. Sorry.

29:06.856 --> 29:08.825
You'll have to take her back.

29:12.966 --> 29:14.031
Let's go.

29:29.027 --> 29:32.086
Franky! What the...

29:35.025 --> 29:36.636
What are you gonna do, huh?

29:36.716 --> 29:38.287
Bitch slap me?

29:43.234 --> 29:45.370
Consider yourself bitch slapped.

29:58.092 --> 30:01.389
Ah. Pinot.

30:02.556 --> 30:04.530
I don't like shiraz.

30:24.693 --> 30:28.638
Vera, you know that I've always wanted
to be more than just a mentor to you.

30:32.665 --> 30:34.516
I value our relationship.

30:37.213 --> 30:40.555
Let me explain why.
I enjoy working with you,

30:42.285 --> 30:45.144
and I feel that that sense of

30:46.472 --> 30:48.886
professional satisfaction
is reciprocated.

30:49.811 --> 30:53.675
I believe that we've developed
a certain rapport,

30:53.797 --> 30:57.421
based on mutual respect
and understanding

30:59.151 --> 31:02.370
that transcends our
difference in status, hmm?

31:02.452 --> 31:05.068
I'm not one to make friends.

31:08.651 --> 31:12.957
But I do feel that we still, we share a
common philosophy when it comes to corrections.

31:14.366 --> 31:18.513
I mean, I don't feel that we're that dissimilar
in some ways... OK, no stop. OK, stop. Stop.

31:19.760 --> 31:22.337
You and I are nothing
like each other.

31:22.458 --> 31:25.838
I would never do to anyone
what you did to me.

31:28.252 --> 31:29.943
I'm sorry. I have no idea
what you're talking about.

31:30.062 --> 31:33.568
During the riot,
when the prisoners had a syringe

31:33.647 --> 31:35.979
to my throat,

31:37.871 --> 31:39.684
you refused to negotiate.

31:39.845 --> 31:42.220
You were willing to throw me to
that pack of dogs without a second thought.

31:42.381 --> 31:44.997
That is not true. It is true. If it wasn't
for Mr Channing, you would have let...

31:45.158 --> 31:46.970
I don't know who you have been
talking to... No, just stop. Just stop lying.

31:47.131 --> 31:49.385
I know what you are doing. Somebody's
trying to drive a wedge between us.

31:49.505 --> 31:53.571
You don't care about me.
You have never cared about me. I do.

31:56.024 --> 31:57.435
I do care.

32:08.142 --> 32:10.879
They stabbed me with a needle.

32:10.960 --> 32:13.377
Well, that is hardly my fault.

32:14.782 --> 32:16.876
I have Hepatitis C.

33:06.361 --> 33:08.452
Morning, Vera.
Governor.

33:08.530 --> 33:09.975
Um, last night.

33:10.942 --> 33:13.067
Is it...
Is it what, Vera?

33:13.245 --> 33:16.458
Is it going to affect my career?

33:16.579 --> 33:20.313
Last night never happened.
After you.

33:26.487 --> 33:29.420
I had another dream about bubs
last night, Dor. Yeah?

33:29.541 --> 33:33.234
Oh, she was so beautiful
and chubby and perfect.

33:34.360 --> 33:37.613
What if she's a he, hey?
Well, I just know it's a she.

33:37.732 --> 33:41.829
But I'll love it either way.
Oh, that's good to know, Jess.

33:42.795 --> 33:44.802
Well, if it isn't
the Governor's slag.

33:44.923 --> 33:47.333
Making yourself pretty
for you-know-who?

33:47.403 --> 33:50.574
Leave her alone.
What'd you do for the mattress, eh?

33:50.696 --> 33:52.744
Take her to Liquorland,
or did you just lag?

33:52.868 --> 33:55.677
You're just jealous, Juice.
Get the fuck out!

34:00.977 --> 34:03.148
Oh, not you, Dorsy. No, no, no.

34:03.307 --> 34:06.479
Me and the boys have been thinking
what we can get you for the bubby shower.

34:06.600 --> 34:09.896
We've come up with a gift that keeps
on giving. Haven't we, Stell? Yeah.

34:10.016 --> 34:14.513
All it'll take is one little jab
with an infected needle and

34:14.635 --> 34:17.806
you and the rugrat can join our club.
You wouldn't dare.

34:17.926 --> 34:20.257
Wouldn't I?
Get off me.

34:20.335 --> 34:22.466
Get off me!

34:31.380 --> 34:34.714
Ah! My baby!

34:34.797 --> 34:36.684
It's just a fuckin' fanny pad.

34:36.844 --> 34:39.935
What is going on in here?
She slipped on the wet floor, Ms Bennett.

34:40.016 --> 34:41.661
She could sue you for that.

34:41.824 --> 34:44.755
Get out, Gambaro! All of you,
get out of now. Are you alright?

34:44.877 --> 34:47.846
Oh, my gosh! Dors!
Can you get up?

34:51.342 --> 34:55.038
Heartbeat's normal. Strong.
Everything's looking fine, Doreen.

34:55.159 --> 34:57.246
Are you sure?
Absolutely, yes.

34:57.367 --> 35:01.506
If I got jabbed by a needle that
had Hep C, could the baby catch it?

35:01.584 --> 35:03.312
Did you get jabbed?

35:03.430 --> 35:05.238
Did somebody
threaten you, Anderson?

35:06.162 --> 35:07.888
Was it Lucy Gambaro?

35:08.007 --> 35:11.864
No, Ms Bennett. I was just
wondering, you know. What happened?

35:11.985 --> 35:14.879
Well, it was...
I just slipped in the shower.

35:15.000 --> 35:18.090
- Is all this alright?
- Yes. She's fine. Yeah.

35:18.210 --> 35:22.348
I'm putting you into Protection.
Just until the birth of the baby.

35:22.467 --> 35:25.159
Oh, no, Ms Ferguson.
Please don't... It's done.

35:25.279 --> 35:27.529
Ms Bennett, will you make
the necessary arrangements?

35:27.610 --> 35:29.458
Yes, Governor.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.408
Why can't I go too?
Governor's orders.

35:37.569 --> 35:41.183
But I'm her alternate carer.
You are the baby's alternate carer, Warner,

35:41.306 --> 35:43.675
and the baby's not born yet.
This isn't fair!

35:43.795 --> 35:47.691
Oh, this isn't fair!
Get over it, ya big drama queen.

35:49.377 --> 35:51.225
Eat shit, Boomer.

35:51.345 --> 35:55.160
Oh, I knew it. I was right
about you the first time.

35:55.241 --> 35:56.927
You really are fuckin' creepy.

35:57.010 --> 35:59.497
'Sierra 7 to Sierra 3.'

35:59.618 --> 36:01.706
This is Sierra 3.
'Officer required...'

36:01.787 --> 36:03.555
Hey, Mr Fletcher.

36:03.675 --> 36:07.210
Can you please give
this to Doreen for me? Sure.

36:07.893 --> 36:10.344
Thank you.

36:10.425 --> 36:11.969
Mr Fletcher?

36:14.197 --> 36:15.683
Mr Fletcher?

36:26.528 --> 36:28.796
Ms Ferguson, I want to be put in
Protection with Doreen.

36:28.818 --> 36:31.067
What you want, Warner,
is of no consequence.

36:31.146 --> 36:32.913
But Doreen needs me.

36:33.035 --> 36:35.243
Anderson has all she needs.
I'm important to her.

36:35.363 --> 36:37.856
'Attention, compound. The count
will commence in five minutes.'

36:37.977 --> 36:40.345
Please, Ms Ferguson.
I need to be with Doreen.

36:40.464 --> 36:44.159
You need to return to your Unit
for the count, Warner. Now.

36:45.966 --> 36:48.215
You're a fucking bitch.

36:51.712 --> 36:53.277
Slot her.

36:53.356 --> 36:56.331
Huh? Fuck you!

36:56.410 --> 36:57.935
Fuck you!

36:58.017 --> 37:00.306
Let go of me! Fuck you, Ferguson!

37:00.386 --> 37:02.596
You're a cold-hearted bitch!

37:02.716 --> 37:07.456
You're a fucking, battered
old whore! Fuck you, Ferguson!

37:07.576 --> 37:12.635
You're a fucking weirdo!
Everybody hates you!

38:13.644 --> 38:15.894
What are you doing?

38:18.185 --> 38:20.148
Ah, that's private.

38:21.314 --> 38:22.721
Who's this?

38:24.848 --> 38:27.218
No-one.
It's the same face. Who is he?

38:27.341 --> 38:30.591
The same face.
The same face. Who is he?

38:30.713 --> 38:34.490
He's nobody. He's just a man
inside my head.

38:35.814 --> 38:38.020
I need to know, Bea.

38:39.511 --> 38:40.571
Please.

38:46.094 --> 38:48.064
He's the man who drugged me.

38:48.826 --> 38:51.477
Why did he drug you?
What was his reason?

38:51.599 --> 38:54.689
Why should I tell you?
You're not going to believe me.

38:54.770 --> 38:55.834
Please.

39:01.474 --> 39:03.927
He works for Ferguson.
He's her thug.

39:09.590 --> 39:12.845
She wanted to stop me from
getting to Jodie's hearing.

39:14.371 --> 39:16.017
I believe you.

39:22.308 --> 39:24.642
Put all the leftovers away, Franky.
Anything else?

39:24.761 --> 39:27.538
No, I got it.
Go put your feet up.

39:34.584 --> 39:36.954
Lunchtime's over.
I'd offer to make you a sanga,

39:37.076 --> 39:39.292
but I can't promise
I won't gob in it.

39:39.412 --> 39:41.665
Franky...
Got nothing to say to you.

39:41.787 --> 39:45.568
You were right
when you said I was lying.

39:45.689 --> 39:48.305
I'm not stopping the sessions
because of the rumours.

39:51.082 --> 39:53.133
You heard of the term
'transference'?

39:53.938 --> 39:59.209
In a patient-therapist relationship,
romantic feelings can develop.

39:59.330 --> 40:02.429
And when that happens,
it clouds objectivity

40:02.510 --> 40:04.282
and that relationship breaks down.

40:04.404 --> 40:07.824
You've got tickets on yourself if
you think I've got the hots for ya.

40:07.903 --> 40:10.239
I was talking about me, Franky.

40:14.824 --> 40:17.037
So what? You're in love with me?

40:18.247 --> 40:19.312
No.

40:23.238 --> 40:25.206
So you just wanna fuck me?

40:36.555 --> 40:38.206
I can live with that.

40:39.575 --> 40:40.638
I can't.

40:46.417 --> 40:48.389
What are you afraid of?

41:15.473 --> 41:17.359
Don't stop on my account.

41:20.540 --> 41:22.555
That was lovely.

41:25.330 --> 41:27.906
I see you've made it your own.

41:28.188 --> 41:30.238
Who's this?

41:30.320 --> 41:32.334
Oh, that's my sister, Lily.

41:34.305 --> 41:36.761
Family is important, isn't it?

41:39.577 --> 41:41.346
I don't have family.

41:44.768 --> 41:46.497
Who's Jianna?

41:47.688 --> 41:48.693
What?

41:48.711 --> 41:53.420
It's just the other night, in
the kitchen, you called me Jianna.

41:54.225 --> 41:57.205
Did I? Yeah.

42:00.543 --> 42:02.313
How strange.

42:09.880 --> 42:13.624
You remember I told you about
that prisoner from another

42:13.743 --> 42:18.371
correctional facility that
had her baby taken from her?

42:20.262 --> 42:22.557
Yeah, by a social worker.

42:24.006 --> 42:28.875
Her name was Jianna.
She later killed herself.

42:30.608 --> 42:33.906
It was a, uh, tragedy.

42:38.133 --> 42:40.304
But don't you worry, Doreen.

42:41.109 --> 42:45.091
I failed Jianna.
But I promise I won't fail you.

42:46.379 --> 42:48.312
I'll protect you.

42:50.767 --> 42:53.785
Oh, I think
the little bugger's awake.

42:58.533 --> 43:02.479
May I?
Yeah.

43:26.541 --> 43:33.104
Oh, I think my waters just broke.

43:41.227 --> 43:44.347
OK, Doreen.
You're doing really, really well.

43:44.468 --> 43:47.067
Really well.
Where's Nash?

43:47.149 --> 43:50.306
Has someone rung Nash?

43:51.227 --> 43:54.306
Why is she still in here?
She's fully dilated, Governor.

43:54.386 --> 43:55.387
What does that mean?

43:55.408 --> 43:57.369
It means the baby's not going
to wait for the ambulance.

43:57.390 --> 44:01.746
It bloody hurts!
OK, breathe. Try and relax.

44:01.824 --> 44:03.308
Try to relax, OK?

44:03.465 --> 44:08.585
I'm going to get you to push very soon, OK?
No, no, no, no. Not yet, not yet.

44:08.987 --> 44:10.623
Where the fuck is Nash?

44:17.425 --> 44:19.983
It's just pain, Doreen.
It's just pain.

44:21.864 --> 44:24.264
OK, Doreen. I'm going to
get you to bear down and push

44:24.385 --> 44:26.125
in one second, OK?
No. I've gotta push now.

44:26.145 --> 44:30.181
The ambulance has been delayed in
traffic. No, not you! Get out!

44:30.263 --> 44:32.263
Get out! Now! Out! Now!

44:35.863 --> 44:37.903
Well done, Doreen. Well done.

46:20.768 --> 46:23.690
Governor?
Is that ambulance here yet, Mr Fletcher?

46:27.448 --> 46:30.929
A simple question, Mr Fletcher.
It's on its way, Governor.

46:31.048 --> 46:33.069
There's an accident on the highway.
It's blocked up traffic.

46:33.091 --> 46:35.768
Get them into Medical
as soon as they arrive. Sure thing.

46:40.845 --> 46:42.888
What's up with you?

46:43.888 --> 46:44.948
Ferguson.

46:46.648 --> 46:49.125
She tried to kill me.

46:55.406 --> 46:58.286
Oh, you're a trooper, Doreen.
He's beautiful. Look at him.

46:58.407 --> 47:01.766
He looks like his Dad.
Really?

47:01.888 --> 47:04.968
Actually, he looks like a potato.
Look at him.

47:05.086 --> 47:08.726
Deb looked like a beetroot
cos she was so red.

47:10.966 --> 47:12.886
Hey, all the girls send their love.

47:13.006 --> 47:16.166
Oh, thank you.
And Liz gave me this to give to you.

47:16.245 --> 47:19.246
Oh, thank you. That's lovely.

47:19.326 --> 47:20.885
Thank her for me.

47:21.004 --> 47:23.845
Doreen, I'm just going to go get
you another ice pack, OK?

47:23.925 --> 47:24.986
OK.

47:28.483 --> 47:30.722
Hey, I found out about Jianna.

47:30.882 --> 47:34.483
Oh, you don't have to talk about that now.
We'll talk about it later.

47:34.606 --> 47:37.562
It's just you and the boy now.
She was a prisoner, Bea.

47:37.683 --> 47:40.244
At some other jail
that Ferguson worked at.

47:40.364 --> 47:42.725
Prisoner?
Yeah. She had a baby,

47:42.844 --> 47:47.165
and it got taken away from her.
Wow...

47:47.286 --> 47:50.723
Mm. I think Ferguson was
in love with her or something.

47:50.843 --> 47:54.003
Really? Yeah.
She said she couldn't protect her,

47:54.123 --> 47:58.361
and then Jianna ended up
killing herself.

47:58.482 --> 48:01.922
Oh, God. But you should
have seen her, Bea.

48:02.041 --> 48:05.483
It was really weird. I thought
she was gonna kiss me at some point.

48:05.603 --> 48:10.562
Kiss you? Yeah. Mate, seriously,
it was totally weird and creepy.

48:11.639 --> 48:15.402
Oh, God. Imagine that?
She really is a freak.

49:05.518 --> 49:08.196
Joan! Joan!

49:10.118 --> 49:16.356
No, no, no... I warned you, Joan.

49:18.078 --> 49:21.559
This is what happens when
you let emotions interfere.

49:24.677 --> 49:27.837
I'm a freak! I'm a freak!
I'm a freak! I'm a freak!

49:27.917 --> 49:31.475
No, no you're not a freak.

49:33.077 --> 49:34.677
I am, Dad.
