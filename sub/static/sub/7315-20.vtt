WEBVTT

00:04.404 --> 00:07.473
Woman: <i>Chrissie in linguistics</i>
<i>finally got engaged.</i>

00:07.475 --> 00:08.607
Hooper won that bet.

00:08.609 --> 00:10.042
Matt upstairs
won the oscar pool.

00:10.044 --> 00:12.011
And I guessed
hypochondriac carl's

00:12.013 --> 00:13.612
Self-diagnosis-of-the-month.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.014
Turns out,
he actually had cancer.

00:15.016 --> 00:17.149
Treatable skin cancer,
but who knew?

00:17.151 --> 00:19.084
That's about all you missed
while you were out.

00:19.086 --> 00:21.020
I'll go over vending machine
changes tomorrow.

00:21.022 --> 00:22.154
(computer trilling)

00:22.156 --> 00:24.656
Are you running rsa keys?

00:24.658 --> 00:25.791
Yes.

00:25.793 --> 00:27.559
The encryption's
not the problem.

00:27.561 --> 00:30.129
These e-mails are useless,
not to mention a week old.

00:30.131 --> 00:32.164
Was it always this dark in here?

00:32.166 --> 00:33.332
Can we turn on the overheads?

00:33.334 --> 00:34.767
Fluorescent lights
make me violent.

00:34.769 --> 00:36.435
Plus, that conrad award
on your desk

00:36.437 --> 00:38.037
Is a murder weapon
waiting to happen.

00:38.039 --> 00:39.204
Tell me about it.

00:39.206 --> 00:41.140
You're just tired.
I've got those

00:41.142 --> 00:41.807
Caffeine eye drops
if you need...

00:41.809 --> 00:42.775
Stop.

00:42.777 --> 00:44.777
Get the boss.

00:44.779 --> 00:47.046
Now.

00:53.086 --> 00:54.653
Go.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.555
Two weeks ago, a naval
intelligence officer was killed

00:56.557 --> 00:58.090
In budapest, hungary.

00:58.092 --> 01:00.192
A bomb in his hotel room.
Local fuzz

01:00.194 --> 01:02.661
And ncis field office found
squat and the case went cold.

01:02.663 --> 01:04.096
Until now, because...

01:04.098 --> 01:05.230
We just flagged
an e-mail.

01:05.232 --> 01:07.399
Sender is anonymous,
but the recipient is

01:07.401 --> 01:09.101
An overseas alias
we've been tracking.

01:09.103 --> 01:11.270
It mentions a rental
address in virginia

01:11.272 --> 01:12.738
"where you can lay low

01:12.740 --> 01:14.206
And won't
be disturbed."

01:14.208 --> 01:15.841
This proves there's an operative
in the states.

01:15.843 --> 01:18.444
I mean, this could bust
the whole case wide open.

01:18.446 --> 01:20.546
I will get with
the fbi and ncis...

01:20.548 --> 01:21.647
No.

01:22.615 --> 01:24.683
You won't.

01:29.222 --> 01:31.590
Because you two
never saw this.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.559
What? Why?
That's an order.

01:33.561 --> 01:34.693
Understood?

02:12.332 --> 02:14.533
This is big.

02:16.336 --> 02:18.203
I think I'm gonna
need a minute.
Tony,

02:18.205 --> 02:19.438
What is it? Come on.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.340
It's not like I'm asking you
to move in here.

02:21.342 --> 02:24.543
My place is not
handicap accessible.

02:24.545 --> 02:26.345
But you got those
three steps out front.

02:26.347 --> 02:28.647
Yes, and the landlord agreed
to bring it up to code

02:28.649 --> 02:29.882
And install a ramp.

02:29.884 --> 02:32.351
(chuckles)
look at you.

02:32.353 --> 02:35.554
Well... I got nothing then.

02:35.556 --> 02:38.357
Congratulations.
Very exciting. Good luck.

02:38.359 --> 02:39.358
Really? That's it?

02:39.360 --> 02:40.859
Delilah.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.861
She's a special lady.
Yeah, I know.

02:42.863 --> 02:45.364
I guess moving in together
is the next logical step.

02:45.366 --> 02:47.332
And I really want her to.

02:47.334 --> 02:48.634
(phone ringing)
so of course
she'll say yes.

02:48.636 --> 02:49.902
Exactly.

02:51.371 --> 02:52.371
Then why am I so nervous?

02:52.373 --> 02:54.339
Hold on. Hello?

02:54.341 --> 02:55.507
Hey, tony. It's delilah.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.842
Oh, hey...
Don't say my name.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.377
Is tim there?

02:58.379 --> 03:00.379
Uh... Yeah.

03:00.381 --> 03:01.580
Don't let him know it's me.

03:01.582 --> 03:02.881
I need to talk to you privately.

03:02.883 --> 03:05.284
Oh. (chuckles) I thought
you were someone else.

03:05.286 --> 03:08.287
Um, you're the lady from
the magazine subscription...

03:08.289 --> 03:09.821
Web site?

03:09.823 --> 03:12.291
Thought I did
this online.

03:12.293 --> 03:15.294
Um, well, let's just go back
and... Review them again.

03:15.296 --> 03:16.762
Start with, um... Go slow.

03:16.764 --> 03:19.331
Uh, start with golf

03:19.333 --> 03:21.767
And, uh... Uh-huh.

03:23.636 --> 03:26.338
(whispers):
Just one second.

03:30.276 --> 03:31.944
(gasps) who put you in here?

03:31.946 --> 03:33.979
Are you alone, tony?

03:33.981 --> 03:35.781
In my own way.

03:35.783 --> 03:37.950
I didn't want to get tim
in trouble. If I'm indicted

03:37.952 --> 03:39.818
For treason, it's much harder
to draw a straight line

03:39.820 --> 03:41.320
Between you and me.
What?

03:41.322 --> 03:42.721
But I wouldn't worry about it.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.790
The murder of
navy lieutenant kit jones--

03:44.792 --> 03:46.291
You know the progress
of that investigation?

03:46.293 --> 03:48.760
(sighs) well, it was, like,
two weeks ago.

03:48.762 --> 03:50.229
In budapest. Yeah.

03:50.231 --> 03:51.463
Well, the last I heard,
they'd hit a dead end.

03:51.465 --> 03:52.798
But that's
the european field office.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.400
Nothing on the down low?
Maybe a...

03:55.402 --> 03:58.370
Classified investigation
someone's trying to keep quiet?

03:58.372 --> 04:02.407
Oh. I thought you were the one
with the d.O.D.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.376
I already hacked
into every federal database

04:04.378 --> 04:06.445
And found nothing.
This is so weird.

04:06.447 --> 04:08.580
And criminal.
And it's about to get worse.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.282
I need to talk to agent gibbs.

04:10.284 --> 04:11.016
(door opens)

04:14.420 --> 04:15.954
Tony, what are you
doing in the closet?

04:15.956 --> 04:17.623
Tony?

04:17.625 --> 04:18.624
Finding myself. (chuckles)

04:18.626 --> 04:19.625
Tony?

04:19.627 --> 04:20.792
It's for you.

04:23.563 --> 04:25.697
Excuse me.

04:28.434 --> 04:30.435
Mcgee: You know you could
get fired for this.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.638
And why did you call
tony instead of me?

04:32.640 --> 04:35.507
This is important,
agent gibbs.

04:35.509 --> 04:36.808
Lieutenant jones
was murdered while trying

04:36.810 --> 04:38.477
To take down
an underground web site

04:38.479 --> 04:42.381
That sells everything
from drugs to... Hit men.

04:42.383 --> 04:44.349
He got too close.
Yes.

04:44.351 --> 04:47.552
And now we have intel
on those responsible.

04:47.554 --> 04:48.887
In virginia.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.922
Intel that you were
ordered to ignore.

04:50.924 --> 04:52.658
Delilah: Clearly my boss
was given orders, too.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.426
But why?
And by whom?

04:54.428 --> 04:55.627
There is no reason for it.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.729
As far as you know.
That's true.

04:57.731 --> 05:00.532
But nobody is giving me
straight answers.

05:00.534 --> 05:02.901
And when it comes to finding
murderers, that's wrong.

05:02.903 --> 05:06.571
If you don't look into it,
our only lead goes cold.

05:06.573 --> 05:08.707
Mcgee: Look, you've only
been back to work

05:08.709 --> 05:09.841
A week.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.543
Maybe you should
slow down.

05:11.545 --> 05:12.611
Slow down?

05:14.414 --> 05:16.682
Well, delilah,
what he's saying...

05:16.684 --> 05:18.317
Is let us
check it first.

05:19.419 --> 05:20.419
Right, tim?

05:20.421 --> 05:21.687
Well, boss,

05:21.689 --> 05:23.055
We're not... I mean,

05:23.057 --> 05:25.490
We don't even have a warrant
to search the place.

05:26.392 --> 05:27.626
I already called the landlord.

05:27.628 --> 05:31.930
Willing to let
animal control check for rats.

05:36.469 --> 05:39.104
Man: <i>My lawyer called this place</i>
<i>an investment.</i>

05:39.106 --> 05:41.573
It's not exactly in demand,
but it's not because of vermin.

05:41.575 --> 05:43.575
I keep up
on my inspections.

05:43.577 --> 05:46.044
Yeah, we're more concerned
with your, uh, last tenant,

05:46.046 --> 05:49.548
Yeah, I gave your secretary
the name when she called.

05:49.550 --> 05:52.484
We ran it.
Turns out, it was fake.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.619
Huh. Yeah, sorry.

05:54.621 --> 05:56.555
Like I said, I
can't be too picky.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.557
He was the first
renter I had all year.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.959
He paid six months in cash,
but I never met the guy.

06:00.961 --> 06:03.462
You said he moved out.
Yeah.

06:03.464 --> 06:04.930
Yeah, he was here a
week, and then I found

06:04.932 --> 06:08.800
Thought he was gonna come back
looking for a refund, but...

06:08.802 --> 06:10.869
This-this is about
animal control?

06:10.871 --> 06:12.671
We're tracking a man
who's selling

06:12.673 --> 06:14.506
Illegal
mexican chinchillas.

06:14.508 --> 06:16.942
They breed with common
house rats, and the offspring

06:16.944 --> 06:19.010
Are especially dangerous,
violent.

06:19.012 --> 06:20.712
Did he leave
anything behind?

06:20.714 --> 06:22.447
No. No, no, no.

06:22.449 --> 06:24.449
In fact, he was the first
tenant that actually cleaned.

06:24.451 --> 06:26.385
Left the whole place
smelling like bleach.

06:26.387 --> 06:28.019
Mm.
Bleach.

06:28.021 --> 06:29.521
Does that mean
something?

06:29.523 --> 06:31.556
It dissolves
chinchilla fur.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.024
Oh.

06:33.026 --> 06:35.127
You guys... You're not gonna
tear up the floor

06:35.129 --> 06:38.597
Oh. Well, you hope not,
but, you know, sometime...

06:38.599 --> 06:42.000
'cause, I mean, you know,
it's not the taj mahal,

06:42.002 --> 06:43.635
But no reason
to make it worse.

06:43.637 --> 06:46.838
Well, you can check it out
after, if you want.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.907
No, no, no. No, no, no. I'll
take your word for it, I guess.

06:48.909 --> 06:52.010
You know, and, uh,
surgery tomorrow,

06:52.012 --> 06:53.612
But stairs have been murder.

06:55.815 --> 06:57.115
Yeah.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.423
Well, I don't know
about chinchillas,

07:04.425 --> 07:06.491
But there's no blood spatter
anywhere.

07:06.493 --> 07:09.494
Yeah, the only thing left behind
was a partial print

07:09.496 --> 07:12.731
On the base of the toilet
and this used tissue.

07:12.733 --> 07:15.901
You sound
a little disappointed, tim.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.536
I didn't think you wanted
to find anything

07:17.538 --> 07:19.438
On delilah's little witch hunt.

07:19.440 --> 07:20.739
Yeah, don't start.

07:20.741 --> 07:23.008
Things were just
getting back to normal.

07:23.010 --> 07:25.844
I can't believe she convinced
gibbs to go along with this.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.446
Not an easy task.

07:28.681 --> 07:30.749
So if there's no blood,
why all the bleach?

07:30.751 --> 07:33.552
Considerate renter
does seems far-fetched.

07:33.554 --> 07:36.922
Could mean your
partial print's valuable.

07:36.924 --> 07:38.457
(cell phone ringing)

07:38.459 --> 07:40.992
I already sent photos
for abby to run.

07:40.994 --> 07:43.528
Oh, hey. Maybe it's
delilah again.

07:44.497 --> 07:46.498
Hello, abby.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.867
Really?
That's interesting.

07:49.802 --> 07:52.537
Okay, thanks.
Prints?

07:52.539 --> 07:54.673
Mm.
That was fast.

07:54.675 --> 07:57.476
I'm just not sure
if it's good news or bad news.

07:57.478 --> 07:58.643
Why? Who's our
mystery renter?

07:58.645 --> 08:01.046
Our victim--
lieutenant kit jones.

08:01.048 --> 08:03.815
He died in budapest
two weeks ago.

08:10.923 --> 08:13.091
According to his file
from o.N.I.,

08:13.093 --> 08:14.860
Lieutenant kit jones
was a loyal

08:14.862 --> 08:16.094
And hardworking
cyber specialist.

08:16.096 --> 08:18.029
Delilah: Part of
an interagency task force

08:18.031 --> 08:19.865
Trying to shut down
servers for a web site

08:19.867 --> 08:21.700
Called the
phoenician exchange,

08:21.702 --> 08:23.702
Or px, for short.

08:23.704 --> 08:26.071
Then a bomb decimated
his hotel room in budapest.

08:26.073 --> 08:28.073
Jones was
the only casualty.

08:28.075 --> 08:29.541
Body?
Destroyed.

08:29.543 --> 08:31.243
But phone logs show
jones made a phone call

08:31.245 --> 08:33.545
From his room seconds before
the bomb went off.

08:33.547 --> 08:35.914
National police
had jurisdiction.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.215
By the time the agents

08:37.217 --> 08:38.950
From our field office
in europe got there,

08:38.952 --> 08:41.520
Evidence had gone "missing."

08:41.522 --> 08:42.220
Payoffs.

08:42.222 --> 08:43.555
All for a web site?

08:43.557 --> 08:44.923
Not just
any web site.

08:44.925 --> 08:46.758
A big one.
You've heard of silk road?

08:46.760 --> 08:48.627
Right.

08:48.629 --> 08:51.830
Uh, well, it's-it's kind of
an underground amazon.Com

08:51.832 --> 08:54.032
For drug traffickers.
The px is an offshoot.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.001
You've heard of amazon?

08:56.003 --> 08:57.269
Yeah, the big one.

08:57.271 --> 08:58.870
The px is a middleman

08:58.872 --> 09:00.272
Between sellers and buyers.

09:00.274 --> 09:03.041
Drugs, guns,
fake I.D.S--

09:03.043 --> 09:04.109
Everything in
one secure location.

09:04.111 --> 09:07.979
Black market. No names,
no traffic monitoring.

09:07.981 --> 09:11.016
Law enforcement can find
the site, just not the servers.

09:11.018 --> 09:13.818
The illegal drugs
sold in the u.S., gibbs.

09:13.820 --> 09:15.820
Yeah, well, that's big.
Bishop:
The only way we fight

09:15.822 --> 09:17.188
Is through the work of
specialists like jones

09:17.190 --> 09:20.058
And delilah, actually.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.027
I'm just a cryptologist
in a dark office.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.695
Jones was on
the front lines.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.864
He personally tracked
the site's former webmaster.

09:25.866 --> 09:28.166
Bishop: Heidi partridge
is awaiting trial

09:28.168 --> 09:29.801
At dandridge
correctional facility.

09:29.803 --> 09:31.036
Leaves a hole
in the operation.

09:31.038 --> 09:32.304
Delilah:
Oh, she made millions.

09:32.306 --> 09:34.105
They'll have no trouble
filling the position.

09:35.908 --> 09:37.008
Unless jones already has.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.810
You think jones
faked his own death

09:38.812 --> 09:40.211
To go work for the bad guys?

09:40.213 --> 09:41.746
Explains a lot.

09:41.748 --> 09:42.981
Mm-hmm.

09:42.983 --> 09:44.049
Except for melody hanson.

09:45.017 --> 09:46.284
His grieving fiancée.

09:46.286 --> 09:49.721
Melody: <i>We were supposed</i>
<i>to get married last Saturday.</i>

09:49.723 --> 09:52.257
We wanted a big wedding with
lots of family and friends,

09:52.259 --> 09:55.360
So we waited until
we could afford it.

09:55.362 --> 09:58.263
Almost two years.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.131
If only we had known.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.800
There's no way you could've.

10:01.802 --> 10:04.369
After the...

10:04.371 --> 10:06.771
After what happened to kit,

10:06.773 --> 10:10.775
I, uh... I was able to cancel
the flowers and the chapel,

10:10.777 --> 10:12.777
But we were gonna
have a reception

10:12.779 --> 10:15.347
At the restaurant
where he proposed.

10:15.349 --> 10:17.248
You ever heard of leo's?

10:17.250 --> 10:19.818
No.
You want
to try it?

10:19.820 --> 10:22.621
I had to pay for
the catering.

10:22.623 --> 10:23.788
And the cake.

10:23.790 --> 10:26.057
I have so much food.

10:26.059 --> 10:28.026
(sobs softly) please,
would you take some?

10:28.028 --> 10:31.129
Because I have to get
it out of my house.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.632
(sobs softly, sniffles)

10:34.800 --> 10:37.102
The lieutenant
was a good man.

10:37.104 --> 10:38.103
Mm-hmm.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.304
Smart guy.

10:39.306 --> 10:42.907
Top of his class at stanford.

10:42.909 --> 10:46.211
He always committed 100%
to everything he did.

10:46.213 --> 10:48.647
He like his job?

10:48.649 --> 10:50.248
Yeah.

10:51.817 --> 10:53.985
I mean, y-yes, of course he did.

10:53.987 --> 10:57.088
He... He died doing it.

10:57.090 --> 11:00.125
He died serving
his country.

11:01.927 --> 11:03.728
Last time you spoke,

11:03.730 --> 11:05.930
He talk about anything
out of the ordinary?

11:07.700 --> 11:09.200
Wedding veils.

11:09.202 --> 11:10.702
(chuckles softly)

11:10.704 --> 11:12.170
He wanted me
to wear one.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.239
I think they're outdated.

11:15.775 --> 11:17.375
Look, it's, um...

11:17.377 --> 11:20.345
It's like I told the agents
overseas, kit was excited.

11:20.347 --> 11:23.682
He called me every day
while he was gone.

11:23.684 --> 11:26.017
Except one.
When was that?

11:26.019 --> 11:28.253
The day before
the explosion.

11:28.255 --> 11:30.755
I didn't give it much
thought at the time,

11:30.757 --> 11:34.793
But now... I don't
know what to think.

11:36.429 --> 11:38.263
Man (over p.A.):
Visiting hours for pod four

11:38.265 --> 11:39.731
Will be over in 20 minutes.

11:39.733 --> 11:41.733
More visitors.

11:41.735 --> 11:44.936
Can't even enjoy what
little free time I have.

11:44.938 --> 11:47.005
Who are you
with, gentlemen?

11:47.007 --> 11:49.140
Ncis.

11:49.142 --> 11:50.742
I'm special agent dinozzo,

11:50.744 --> 11:53.244
This is very special
agent tim mcgee.

11:53.246 --> 11:55.747
Miss partridge, we'd like
to ask you a few questions

11:55.749 --> 11:57.348
About the
phoenician exchange web site.

11:57.350 --> 11:59.217
As you know,
I'm still awaiting trial

11:59.219 --> 12:00.318
And won't incriminate myself.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.220
But I've developed
a little system

12:02.222 --> 12:03.988
To make all of these
interviews easier,

12:03.990 --> 12:04.923
For everyone.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.991
You'll start with...

12:06.993 --> 12:08.293
A happy face.

12:08.295 --> 12:10.028
If your questions
stay on task,

12:10.030 --> 12:12.197
You keep it and
we keep talking.

12:13.432 --> 12:15.133
I was a kindergarten teacher.

12:15.135 --> 12:17.435
Before you started running the
world's most wanted web site?

12:19.171 --> 12:21.339
What's that?
An "uh-oh" face.

12:23.309 --> 12:25.343
But you can still earn
back your happy face.

12:25.345 --> 12:27.812
Unless we get
a sad face first?

12:27.814 --> 12:29.447
I see you were
the "a" student.

12:29.449 --> 12:30.815
More like teacher's pet.

12:32.384 --> 12:34.419
Mcgee: You're facing charges
for narcotics trafficking,

12:34.421 --> 12:35.820
Money laundering

12:35.822 --> 12:37.322
And computer hacking.

12:37.324 --> 12:39.257
Like I've stated publicly,

12:39.259 --> 12:42.227
I was hired to keep a web
site functioning and secure.

12:42.229 --> 12:44.062
On a purely code level.

12:44.064 --> 12:46.164
I had no actual knowledge
of what was being sold.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.365
So you're saying you became

12:47.367 --> 12:50.101
The wolf of sesame street
by accident?

12:53.072 --> 12:55.206
Programming was a hobby.

12:55.208 --> 12:58.309
I found myself on certain
message boards and...

12:58.311 --> 13:00.178
Stumbled into things.

13:00.180 --> 13:02.247
That's the beauty
of the internet.

13:02.249 --> 13:04.115
Anyone can be anything.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.451
Do anything.

13:08.020 --> 13:10.121
Until lieutenant jones
came along.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.489
Gold star for him.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.825
Who took over
after you were arrested?

13:16.129 --> 13:20.331
We're willing to talk plea deal
if you can give us a name.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.367
We're thinking
lieutenant jones himself.

13:23.936 --> 13:26.037
This interview's over.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.039
What?! I didn't
even say anything!

13:28.041 --> 13:30.208
Your questions are violating
a deal I already have in place.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.010
No, we read your
current plea agreement.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.344
That's not true.
My new deal.

13:33.346 --> 13:35.847
As of this morning.

13:35.849 --> 13:37.282
He only beat you here
by minutes.

13:37.284 --> 13:39.217
Who's "he?"

13:39.219 --> 13:40.952
Sorry. Class rules.

13:40.954 --> 13:42.253
Guard!

13:45.524 --> 13:47.358
Mcgee: <i>Well, the prison log</i>
<i>doesn't show</i>

13:47.360 --> 13:49.327
<i>Any visitors this morning.</i>

13:49.329 --> 13:51.129
Meaning it's been
tampered with.

13:51.131 --> 13:53.998
First the d.O.D.,
now the prison system.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.600
Ever see <i>tango & cash?</i>

13:55.602 --> 13:57.268
It involve a conspiracy?

13:57.270 --> 13:58.870
Yes, it did.

13:58.872 --> 14:00.038
And this is fubar.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.406
(cell phone ringing)

14:01.408 --> 14:04.409
Hey, boss, we got a
problem. Turns out...

14:04.411 --> 14:06.578
Hello?

14:06.580 --> 14:08.079
That's weird,
the signal cut out.

14:08.081 --> 14:09.314
I had four bars,

14:09.316 --> 14:11.850
Now the light's
flashing.

14:11.852 --> 14:13.251
Oh, mine, too.

14:13.253 --> 14:15.320
Prison cell
phone jammer?

14:15.322 --> 14:18.456
Not likely.
We're too far away.

14:18.458 --> 14:19.991
More conspiracy?

14:19.993 --> 14:21.259
How close would
someone have to be?

14:21.261 --> 14:22.994
Pretty close.

14:22.996 --> 14:24.162
Gray sedan.
Your ten o'clock.

14:24.164 --> 14:25.363
Engine's running.

14:29.401 --> 14:31.336
Interesting.
Mm.

14:42.915 --> 14:44.415
Tony:
Federal agents. Freeze.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.251
Turn off the
vehicle. Slowly.

14:46.253 --> 14:47.652
Relax. I can explain.

14:47.654 --> 14:50.355
Why you're interfering
with a federal investigation?

14:50.357 --> 14:52.090
That's funny.
Hey.

14:53.259 --> 14:55.526
It's just my badge.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.528
Case officer jim brisco.

14:57.530 --> 15:01.466
You're the ones interfering
with an ongoing cia operation.

15:22.121 --> 15:23.454
Officer brisco.

15:23.456 --> 15:25.056
Director.

15:25.058 --> 15:28.159
So how exactly did ncis
get onto all this?

15:28.161 --> 15:30.361
Anonymous tip.
I hope so.

15:30.363 --> 15:32.163
'cause our memo to
the intelligence community

15:32.165 --> 15:33.631
Was clear.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.300
Not to mention
compartmented.

15:35.302 --> 15:37.101
Jones is still alive?

15:37.103 --> 15:38.569
Made contact
yesterday.

15:38.571 --> 15:41.139
Cia was part of
his joint task force

15:41.141 --> 15:43.174
Until we pulled him
on to a side project.

15:43.176 --> 15:44.943
Undercover.

15:46.312 --> 15:48.212
On u.S. Soil?

15:48.214 --> 15:50.548
Operation brought us
stateside a week ago.

15:50.550 --> 15:53.217
We were waiting to inform
the feds till we had something.

15:53.219 --> 15:55.153
The hotel
explosion was you.

15:55.155 --> 15:58.089
Deep cover measures.

15:58.091 --> 16:00.658
Need to know.

16:00.660 --> 16:03.094
Jones's work on the px servers
overlapped

16:03.096 --> 16:05.063
With a cia
money laundering operation.

16:05.065 --> 16:07.398
You ever heard of bitcoins?

16:07.400 --> 16:10.068
Never mind,
it's confusing.

16:10.070 --> 16:13.237
Jones has
and he agreed to help.

16:13.239 --> 16:15.506
I understand--
the cia has left

16:15.508 --> 16:17.208
A bad taste in your mouth.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.043
Trent kort-flavored,
right?

16:19.045 --> 16:21.512
How do you know
trent kort?

16:21.514 --> 16:24.048
Don't. But it's always him.

16:24.050 --> 16:26.050
Guy like that
only makes my job harder.

16:26.052 --> 16:27.151
Everybody's.

16:27.153 --> 16:28.219
Well, I'm nothing
like him.

16:28.221 --> 16:29.420
I got hair.

16:32.591 --> 16:35.059
I'll even ask nicely.

16:35.061 --> 16:37.095
Please back off.

16:37.097 --> 16:40.098
For the sake of the op
and jones's life.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.532
He missed his
own wedding.

16:41.534 --> 16:42.700
Yes.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.469
He knew the op could go long.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.471
But he also knew
we had a rare chance

16:46.473 --> 16:48.172
To take out the entire px.

16:48.174 --> 16:50.675
He left his fiancée
thinking he was dead.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.343
For her own good.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.212
Gibbs: Well, you
tell her that.

16:54.214 --> 16:55.513
She's here.

16:55.515 --> 16:58.016
You brought her in?

16:58.018 --> 16:59.517
You can't say anything.

16:59.519 --> 17:02.153
It could make her
a target.

17:02.155 --> 17:05.523
Look, when this is all over,
she'll understand.

17:07.159 --> 17:09.160
I  <i>don't</i>understand.

17:09.162 --> 17:11.262
Why am I here again?
I've told you everything.

17:11.264 --> 17:12.563
We're just trying to...

17:12.565 --> 17:14.465
Find the murderer, I know.

17:14.467 --> 17:17.468
But it's been nothing
for two weeks, and now all this.

17:17.470 --> 17:19.370
You know something.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.272
No. No.

17:27.646 --> 17:29.647
Can you tell me what's going on?

17:29.649 --> 17:31.349
(clears throat)

17:31.351 --> 17:33.351
Lead didn't pan out.

17:33.353 --> 17:35.420
Bad info.

17:37.656 --> 17:40.825
So my being here
was just a waste of time.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.126
We apologize.

17:42.128 --> 17:44.228
On behalf of ncis
and the cia.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.097
This agent

17:46.099 --> 17:47.231
Will escort you out.

17:52.805 --> 17:54.672
Cia?

17:54.674 --> 17:56.307
Confirmation, leon.

17:56.309 --> 17:57.642
That she doesn't know anything.

17:59.278 --> 18:00.678
Two weeks is a long time.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.847
To let a loved one
think you're dead? Yeah.

18:04.316 --> 18:05.483
Keep digging.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.518
Quietly.

18:09.188 --> 18:10.788
Our best shot
at finding out

18:10.790 --> 18:13.724
What's going on is to get
to that web site.
How?

18:15.294 --> 18:17.595
We could pose as a vendor
in hopes of communicating

18:17.597 --> 18:20.364
With the site's administrator
and track them.

18:20.366 --> 18:23.267
Might only take
about a week or so.

18:23.269 --> 18:25.803
Or we find someone
who already is a vendor.

18:25.805 --> 18:26.838
It's faster.
Yeah, that one.

18:26.840 --> 18:27.839
Great.

18:27.841 --> 18:30.508
I'll just go ask mcgee.

18:30.510 --> 18:32.376
Mcgee:
This is a bad idea.

18:32.378 --> 18:34.145
Tony: You and your
little informant

18:34.147 --> 18:35.379
Don't see eye to nerdy eye?

18:35.381 --> 18:37.315
Are we cutting into
his video game time?

18:37.317 --> 18:38.816
Sampson is not little.

18:38.818 --> 18:40.318
And he's not
my informant.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.786
I only know about him
through delilah.

18:43.188 --> 18:44.622
Sampson and delilah?

18:44.624 --> 18:46.357
Yeah. She gave
him that nickname

18:46.359 --> 18:48.793
When they were together.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.561
I can understand why
you wouldn't want to use him.

18:50.563 --> 18:52.697
It's not just that;
he's a drug dealer

18:52.699 --> 18:54.732
Who can't be trusted.
Delilah dated a drug dealer?

18:54.734 --> 18:58.603
Not illegal ones,
just ones that are hard to find.

18:58.605 --> 19:00.338
Well, I'm sure
you have much more

19:00.340 --> 19:01.372
To offer delilah than...

19:01.374 --> 19:03.307
Sampson.

19:03.309 --> 19:06.611
Not to mention you got
the apartment key, mcgee.

19:07.913 --> 19:09.714
Mcgee:
There he is.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.315
Tony:
Oh, no.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.751
What, you mean the...
Magilla gorilla there?

19:13.753 --> 19:16.287
He uses the px web site
to buy and sell steroids.

19:16.289 --> 19:18.422
(sighs) we're gonna
have to catch that guy?

19:18.424 --> 19:20.358
Should've brought the
elephant tranquilizer.

19:23.262 --> 19:24.762
(car doors close)

19:24.764 --> 19:27.431
Oh, come on.

19:27.433 --> 19:28.933
Man:
A tendency to go rogue.

19:28.935 --> 19:31.802
His own code of justice
often different from the law.

19:31.804 --> 19:33.237
Insubordination.

19:33.239 --> 19:34.772
You talking about
brisco or kort?

19:34.774 --> 19:37.241
Actually, I was talking
about your agent gibbs.

19:37.243 --> 19:39.477
Confusion's
interesting though.

19:39.479 --> 19:42.280
Bottom line: We trust
our own people, leon.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.447
We give them
certain freedoms.

19:43.449 --> 19:45.449
Brisco should have
brought us in, kirkwood,

19:45.451 --> 19:47.618
Should have followed protocol.
You know how this looks.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.587
Like cia plays to win.

19:49.589 --> 19:51.656
A spitting contest's
still a contest.

19:51.658 --> 19:53.558
Let us talk to jones.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.760
Clearly brisco was
too polite with you.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.361
It's a flaw of his.

19:57.363 --> 20:00.298
Jones is a cyber
specialist.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.899
Knows how to hide online.

20:01.901 --> 20:06.304
And you moved him
back here easy enough.

20:06.306 --> 20:10.441
So why the hotel bomb and
the misinformation campaign?

20:10.443 --> 20:13.411
Did his cover really
have to go that deep?

20:13.413 --> 20:16.480
You'd put a man's life at risk
to satisfy your own curiosity?

20:16.482 --> 20:17.782
My own professional
concern.

20:17.784 --> 20:19.517
Noted, but the lieutenant's
in good hands,

20:19.519 --> 20:21.586
And if we did need help,
it's fbi jurisdiction.

20:23.388 --> 20:25.856
Protocol, right?

20:32.598 --> 20:34.465
(exhales)

20:34.467 --> 20:35.666
Great workout, guys.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.501
You ran for
six and a half blocks.

20:37.503 --> 20:38.936
You better be very helpful.

20:38.938 --> 20:40.338
Hey, I'm up for
whatever you need.

20:40.340 --> 20:41.973
Tony: Huh?
Sampson: I only ran

20:41.975 --> 20:43.407
To keep up
with appearances.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.243
The fake punches were
a great touch, though.

20:45.245 --> 20:46.677
Those were real punches.

20:46.679 --> 20:49.680
That's funny. I like you.

20:49.682 --> 20:52.850
Uh, sampson, we need
your login info

20:52.852 --> 20:55.519
To access the phoenician
exchange web site.

20:55.521 --> 20:58.456
Already have a tor
browser installed.

21:02.794 --> 21:04.862
Said I'm up for anything,
but that--

21:04.864 --> 21:06.264
That's bad for business.

21:06.266 --> 21:07.365
It could trace back to me.

21:07.367 --> 21:09.033
It won't.
Sorry.

21:09.035 --> 21:10.401
Ask me anything else.

21:10.403 --> 21:11.302
Anything?

21:11.304 --> 21:13.037
Tony, no.

21:13.039 --> 21:14.705
(tony laughs)

21:14.707 --> 21:17.475
Just... Sampson--
and we'll get back

21:17.477 --> 21:18.743
To your nickname
in a second--

21:18.745 --> 21:20.444
When exactly did
you date delilah?

21:20.446 --> 21:21.912
Just before tim. Why?

21:21.914 --> 21:23.714
Tony: So she went from
your shoe size

21:23.716 --> 21:25.049
To his.

21:25.051 --> 21:27.518
Hey, how's delilah doing, tim?

21:27.520 --> 21:30.488
I heard about the accident.
I'd love to catch up with her.

21:30.490 --> 21:32.957
She's well, but I don't
think she's really up for...

21:32.959 --> 21:34.625
She's in the building.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.294
Really?
Tony: Yeah.

21:36.296 --> 21:37.428
Do you think I could...
No.

21:37.430 --> 21:38.829
Depends.

21:50.576 --> 21:53.678
For anything less than
a coffee date with her.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.413
What?!

21:55.415 --> 21:56.580
Done!
Tony!

21:57.482 --> 21:59.617
A supervised coffee date.

22:02.421 --> 22:04.822
(computer beeping)

22:04.824 --> 22:07.992
How did you get sampson
to give up his vendor access?

22:07.994 --> 22:10.561
Well, I guess I
intimidated him.

22:10.563 --> 22:12.463
Where's abby?

22:12.465 --> 22:14.498
She just ran to autopsy.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.400
You get me for now.

22:16.402 --> 22:19.570
Now, shouldn't you be
at your own office?

22:19.572 --> 22:21.539
I mean, this case isn't
supposed to exist.

22:21.541 --> 22:23.908
I am out sick today.

22:23.910 --> 22:26.544
(coughs)

22:26.546 --> 22:28.612
Are you trying to get fired?

22:28.614 --> 22:32.383
No. I'm trying to find out
what happened to a man

22:32.385 --> 22:34.118
Who we thought died
in an explosion.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.053
Kind of hits home for me.

22:36.055 --> 22:38.856
And now, I am also
trying to take out

22:38.858 --> 22:40.958
A major source
of illegal drugs--

22:40.960 --> 22:43.094
Drugs that can fund terrorism.

22:43.096 --> 22:45.496
Which also hits home.

22:45.498 --> 22:47.098
What is the problem, tim?

22:47.100 --> 22:49.533
That you getting in trouble
hits home for me.

22:49.535 --> 22:50.634
That's all.

22:50.636 --> 22:53.003
Oh.

22:53.005 --> 22:55.373
Yeah.

22:55.375 --> 22:58.376
(computer beeps)

22:58.378 --> 23:01.545
So, you into the
px's tor protocols?

23:01.547 --> 23:03.514
Funny that a program
developed by the

23:03.516 --> 23:06.650
Naval research lab now makes
hidden web sites possible.

23:06.652 --> 23:09.553
I wrote a layman's
summary for gibbs.

23:09.555 --> 23:11.822
"there are 500 times
as many hidden sites

23:11.824 --> 23:13.624
"as there are public ones.

23:13.626 --> 23:15.960
They are called the deep web,
or dark web."

23:15.962 --> 23:17.094
Well, you know gibbs;
he probably

23:17.096 --> 23:18.129
Wouldn't have read it anyway.

23:18.131 --> 23:19.964
Find anything?

23:19.966 --> 23:22.433
You bet your ass I did.

23:22.435 --> 23:25.002
Classified d.O.D.
Security protocols.

23:25.004 --> 23:26.637
Built into the site itself.

23:26.639 --> 23:29.573
We developed these codes
to find hidden web sites.

23:29.575 --> 23:32.042
But the site is now using them
to protect itself.

23:32.044 --> 23:34.812
Using our own weapons
against us.
Exactly.

23:34.814 --> 23:36.881
But how did they get our intel
in the first place?

23:36.883 --> 23:39.150
Lieutenant jones
would have access to it.

23:39.152 --> 23:41.652
Meaning he could be
a double agent.

23:44.923 --> 23:47.525
Abby: Gibbs, you
didn't pick up.

23:47.527 --> 23:49.693
It went straight to voice mail.
'cause I'm already here, abbs.

23:49.695 --> 23:51.562
What do we got?
Well, thanks to ducky and jimmy,

23:51.564 --> 23:54.999
I analyzed the only evidence
that tony and mcgee

23:55.001 --> 23:56.967
Found at the
rundown apartment.
Dried-up tissue.

23:56.969 --> 23:59.170
Yes. I processed said mucus

23:59.172 --> 24:01.572
And found viable traces
of blood inside.

24:01.574 --> 24:03.174
It's a confirmed
dna match

24:03.176 --> 24:04.475
To kit jones.

24:05.177 --> 24:06.811
Gibbs:
So, what's the problem?

24:06.813 --> 24:08.679
What we found in his blood.

24:08.681 --> 24:10.114
Jimmy: A low red
blood-cell count,

24:10.116 --> 24:11.715
Also known as anemia.

24:11.717 --> 24:13.651
Plus, there was
a viral infection of the thymus.

24:13.653 --> 24:15.686
Ducky: Both are signs
of malnutrition.

24:15.688 --> 24:19.523
Add that to the percentage
of oxycodone in his blood...

24:19.525 --> 24:21.158
A sedative, which
in high enough doses,

24:21.160 --> 24:22.993
Could render jones
completely unconscious.

24:22.995 --> 24:24.695
Lieutenant is not
a double agent.

24:24.697 --> 24:25.930
No.

24:25.932 --> 24:27.731
He's a prisoner.

24:38.844 --> 24:40.010
I'm still waiting, jim.

24:40.012 --> 24:41.879
Sir...
For that explanation

24:41.881 --> 24:43.080
As to why ncis knows more

24:43.082 --> 24:44.915
About our undercover asset
than we do.

24:44.917 --> 24:46.116
Yes, sir.

24:46.118 --> 24:47.718
A ball has been dropped.

24:47.720 --> 24:48.986
It's a man's life.

24:48.988 --> 24:50.754
I've got paperwork
in front of me

24:50.756 --> 24:53.224
Says you made contact with jones
two days ago. That a lie?

24:53.226 --> 24:55.226
Vance: My people are saying
jones has been captive

24:55.228 --> 24:59.096
My communications
have all been via e-mail.

24:59.098 --> 25:01.198
It's possible they were
written under pretense.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.901
But, sir, if he's being
tortured for intel,

25:03.903 --> 25:06.637
He never used any of
our predetermined duress words.

25:06.639 --> 25:08.072
You blaming him now, brisco?

25:08.074 --> 25:10.107
No, damn it. I am
just as upset as you.

25:10.109 --> 25:12.276
He was my responsibility,
so let's...

25:12.278 --> 25:14.111
Set this right.

25:14.113 --> 25:15.613
You've screwed enough pooches

25:15.615 --> 25:17.948
To make a breeder blush,
not to mention me.

25:17.950 --> 25:20.918
We're out, brisco.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.953
I'd rather you keep this
internal, director.

25:22.955 --> 25:24.688
As a favor?

25:24.690 --> 25:27.024
So that call to the fbi?

25:27.026 --> 25:29.293
Yours to make if you want, leon.
You're on the clock now.

25:29.295 --> 25:32.062
Have been.

25:34.099 --> 25:36.634
Whoever's behind
that web site has jones.

25:36.636 --> 25:38.536
Find them, we find him, leon.

25:38.538 --> 25:40.304
Abby:
<i>Lieutenant jones was smart.</i>

25:40.306 --> 25:41.939
Like, really smart.

25:41.941 --> 25:43.741
The security protocol
that he gave his captors

25:43.743 --> 25:44.975
Was developed by the d.O.D.

25:44.977 --> 25:47.077
And I know how to decrypt them.

25:47.079 --> 25:48.846
Turns out, he sent
us breadcrumbs.

25:48.848 --> 25:50.247
Just sent you
a packet, tim.

25:50.249 --> 25:52.249
Breadcrumbs that are
actually backdoor hacks

25:52.251 --> 25:54.685
That allow us to see
who's been accessing the site.

25:54.687 --> 25:56.253
Coming your way, abbs.

25:56.255 --> 25:58.088
Okay, there's
still no user names

25:58.090 --> 26:00.591
Or server access to
take down the site.

26:00.593 --> 26:02.960
Mcgee: But, thanks to
jones, we're able to see

26:02.962 --> 26:04.562
Local isp access.

26:04.564 --> 26:08.098
And somewhere the head of
leroy jethro gibbs explodes.

26:08.100 --> 26:10.067
We got a hit!

26:10.069 --> 26:14.071
It's from the private isp
of bluemont medical center.

26:14.073 --> 26:16.707
Someone at the hospital
is updating the web site.

26:16.709 --> 26:18.075
Abby:
Okay, I'm cross-referencing

26:18.077 --> 26:19.610
Patient and staff names

26:19.612 --> 26:20.711
With our case files.

26:22.681 --> 26:24.214
Who's ronald troutman?

26:24.216 --> 26:27.785
Landlord. He said he was
having knee surgery today.

26:27.787 --> 26:30.220
Ooh. He's our dark webmaster.

26:30.222 --> 26:32.256
Let's grab him.
It's no guarantee he'll talk.

26:32.258 --> 26:34.124
Leaving jones to die.

26:34.126 --> 26:35.960
Abby: But if he
accessed the px

26:35.962 --> 26:37.261
From the hospital,
that means that

26:37.263 --> 26:38.629
His computer's there.

26:38.631 --> 26:39.930
If we could get to it,

26:39.932 --> 26:41.599
We'd have our proof.

26:41.601 --> 26:43.133
You mean, an undercover
operation of our own?

26:44.836 --> 26:46.337
It's dangerous,
but not a bad idea.

26:50.675 --> 26:54.078
Gibbs:
Mcgee, give me a sit rep.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.046
Mcgee:
Troutman's post-op.

26:56.048 --> 26:58.248
Looks pretty out of it to me.

26:58.250 --> 26:59.717
Got eyes on the laptop.

26:59.719 --> 27:02.252
Now we just need
to get rid of his daughter.

27:02.254 --> 27:03.954
Okay, send in
the junior varsity.

27:09.194 --> 27:11.328
Hello.

27:11.330 --> 27:14.131
(chuckles)
I'm. Dr. Mallard,

27:14.133 --> 27:17.267
And this is, uh,
nurse jimmy.

27:17.269 --> 27:18.836
Uh, is everything okay?

27:18.838 --> 27:20.104
Of course, my dear.

27:20.106 --> 27:22.873
Shift change, that's all.
Routine checkup.

27:22.875 --> 27:25.709
Yes, good. Which means,
this would be a perfect time

27:25.711 --> 27:28.312
For you to go get yourself
a cup of coffee.

27:28.314 --> 27:30.247
I'm-I'm good.

27:30.249 --> 27:34.084
Well, with the amount of
medication they've put into him,

27:34.086 --> 27:37.154
Your father will be
unconscious for some time.

27:37.156 --> 27:39.256
Yup. I.V. Fentanyl infusion.

27:40.258 --> 27:42.059
Pre-med.

27:42.061 --> 27:44.094
Ah. I see.

27:44.096 --> 27:46.096
Right.

27:46.098 --> 27:49.833
Well, I will just, uh,
check on his dressings here,

27:49.835 --> 27:51.235
And, uh, change
his I.V. Fluids.

27:51.237 --> 27:52.970
Care to assist, doctor?

27:52.972 --> 27:54.171
No, thank you,

27:54.173 --> 27:55.973
But perhaps
our medical student would.

27:55.975 --> 27:59.977
She can help you cleanse
the peripatellar incision.

27:59.979 --> 28:04.214
You can tell your father
that you were inside of him.

28:04.216 --> 28:05.315
That's unique, right?

28:05.317 --> 28:07.818
Maybe I could, uh,
use a cappuccino.

28:07.820 --> 28:09.253
I'm sorry.

28:09.255 --> 28:12.022
Why don't I join you? Yeah.

28:12.024 --> 28:13.791
So, you're pre-med.
Mm-hmm.

28:13.793 --> 28:17.261
I-I wonder if it's in any
of the hospitals where I teach.

28:32.844 --> 28:34.878
I thought you were
gonna hack in.
No time.

28:34.880 --> 28:37.081
Got to swap out the
hard drive itself.

28:37.083 --> 28:40.017
I should be able to decrypt
it and find jones before...

28:42.253 --> 28:44.254
Jimmy, he's awake.

28:44.256 --> 28:45.789
What are you doing?

28:45.791 --> 28:47.157
Jimmy:
Yeah, don't worry.

28:47.159 --> 28:49.293
He's-he's as high
as a kite.

28:49.295 --> 28:51.228
Wait.

28:51.230 --> 28:53.130
I know you.

28:53.132 --> 28:54.364
Jimmy!

28:54.366 --> 28:56.734
Or not.

28:59.437 --> 29:03.173
Are there violent
chinchilla babies here, too?

29:03.175 --> 29:05.909
They were here.

29:05.911 --> 29:08.145
(gasps)
no.

29:08.147 --> 29:10.114
But we got rid of them.

29:10.116 --> 29:12.249
(sighs)

29:12.251 --> 29:14.184
Oh, god bless you.

29:15.420 --> 29:17.254
God bless you, sir.

29:18.990 --> 29:20.224
(whispers):
God bless you.

29:20.226 --> 29:23.293
See? I knew it'd be fine.

29:31.302 --> 29:34.204
Oh, glad you're still here.

29:34.206 --> 29:36.273
Oh. Hey, wheels.
Hi.

29:36.275 --> 29:37.975
Whose phone
records are these?

29:37.977 --> 29:40.210
Melody hanson, the fiancée.

29:40.212 --> 29:42.479
On the off chance she's
not telling us something?

29:42.481 --> 29:44.281
Or if she becomes a target.

29:44.283 --> 29:49.319
So... I hear you're looking
to become jane bond.

29:49.321 --> 29:51.155
I can do it.
I don't doubt that.

29:51.157 --> 29:53.791
In fact, I'm sure...
Nobody does it better.

29:53.793 --> 29:56.493
So, listen...

29:56.495 --> 29:58.862
I know you and
tim are close.

29:58.864 --> 30:01.031
We have showered together.
Really?

30:01.033 --> 30:02.466
Mm. I opened an envelope
in this very room, and...

30:02.468 --> 30:04.067
I need your advice.

30:04.069 --> 30:06.804
Oh. Well, I think
he's an all-in-one,

30:06.806 --> 30:08.372
Body wash-shampoo
combo kind of guy.

30:08.374 --> 30:11.241
Not advice on
showering with him.

30:11.243 --> 30:14.444
I need to tell
tim something.

30:14.446 --> 30:17.514
So, with this case,
he thinks I'm trying

30:17.516 --> 30:19.283
To lose my job,
but I'm-I'm not.

30:19.285 --> 30:20.584
It's the opposite.

30:20.586 --> 30:22.586
I'm trying to show
that I can do more.

30:22.588 --> 30:23.887
To move up.

30:23.889 --> 30:25.322
I can understand that.

30:25.324 --> 30:28.158
Because there's this...

30:28.160 --> 30:31.195
Senior analyst opening in dubai.

30:31.197 --> 30:35.432
Dubai... Is not... Here.

30:35.434 --> 30:37.868
I know.

30:37.870 --> 30:41.905
Which leads me to another thing
that I need to tell tim.

30:41.907 --> 30:43.974
Uh...

30:43.976 --> 30:45.275
Are you saying
that you're...?

30:45.277 --> 30:46.276
(computer beeps)

30:46.278 --> 30:48.111
You gonna check that?
What?

30:48.113 --> 30:50.080
Kit jones' fiancée
just received

30:50.082 --> 30:52.616
Six one-second phone
calls from a leo s.

30:52.618 --> 30:54.251
Who's that?

30:54.253 --> 30:56.253
Leo's restaurant.

30:56.255 --> 30:59.089
It's where jones proposed.

30:59.091 --> 31:01.425
Abby: As long as the encryption
isn't too advanced,

31:01.427 --> 31:04.061
We should be in troutman's
hard drive within the hour.

31:04.063 --> 31:06.997
He could be awake
by then, abby.

31:06.999 --> 31:09.533
So, tony said you wanted to talk
with me about something?

31:09.535 --> 31:11.568
Yeah, but, uh, I can wait.

31:11.570 --> 31:13.971
Okay. I can, too.

31:13.973 --> 31:17.140
You had more to talk about?
Yeah, but I can wait.

31:17.142 --> 31:20.277
I can't.
Guys, we have a big problem.

31:20.279 --> 31:22.479
What? Is the security
more advanced than we thought?

31:22.481 --> 31:24.481
It's less. Way less.

31:24.483 --> 31:25.415
I don't see anything.

31:25.417 --> 31:26.917
Exactly.

31:26.919 --> 31:29.453
This hard drive isn't
encrypted. It is blank.

31:29.455 --> 31:30.988
Did we trigger a safeguard?

31:30.990 --> 31:32.322
It's not a booby trap.

31:32.324 --> 31:34.391
Troutman knew we were coming.

31:34.393 --> 31:36.393
Someone tipped him off.

31:47.472 --> 31:49.273
Stop!

31:49.275 --> 31:52.276
Don't move.

31:52.278 --> 31:55.412
Who are you? What agency?

31:55.414 --> 31:57.915
Ncis.

31:57.917 --> 31:59.349
Who's asking?

31:59.351 --> 32:02.085
Don't come any closer.
And don't try anything funny.

32:02.087 --> 32:03.387
I have to be funny.

32:03.389 --> 32:05.422
It's my raison d'etre.
Give me the gun.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.524
Man:
It's not loaded.

32:07.526 --> 32:09.593
Walk.

32:11.029 --> 32:13.430
Lieutenant jones.

32:13.432 --> 32:15.499
I knew making those
phone calls was a mistake.

32:15.501 --> 32:17.034
You trying to draw
melody here?

32:17.036 --> 32:18.402
To explain.

32:18.404 --> 32:20.137
I couldn't stand another day
of her not knowing.

32:20.139 --> 32:21.538
We want to help.
Right.

32:21.540 --> 32:23.006
That's what
the last guy said.

32:23.008 --> 32:24.408
Who's the last guy?

32:24.410 --> 32:26.476
Cia officer brisco.

32:28.179 --> 32:30.047
He was the one
holding me prisoner.

32:40.491 --> 32:43.493
It was a trap.

32:43.495 --> 32:46.063
And I fell for it.

32:46.065 --> 32:48.532
There was never
any undercover operation.

32:48.534 --> 32:50.467
Cia has the paperwork.

32:50.469 --> 32:52.102
Paperwork,
sure, but...

32:52.104 --> 32:54.004
It was all brisco's ruse
to make me think

32:54.006 --> 32:56.573
I was taking down the world's
largest online drug market.

32:56.575 --> 32:59.676
And so you think instead he was
selling intel to the web site?

32:59.678 --> 33:02.079
I know he was.

33:03.581 --> 33:06.249
He tortured me
for security codes.

33:06.251 --> 33:07.484
All while using
the cia

33:07.486 --> 33:09.720
To finance the hotel explosion
and cover-up.

33:09.722 --> 33:11.755
So everyone already thought
I was dead.

33:11.757 --> 33:13.123
Not everyone.

33:13.125 --> 33:15.759
Thank god you started digging.

33:15.761 --> 33:18.528
I was afraid that no one
would ever believe me.

33:18.530 --> 33:20.397
You do believe me?

33:20.399 --> 33:23.233
We processed the apartment

33:23.235 --> 33:26.570
Where you were... Held,

33:26.572 --> 33:29.239
And there's no
sign of torture.

33:29.241 --> 33:32.109
Because brisco kept me
drugged up and in a bathtub.

33:32.111 --> 33:33.577
It made my...

33:33.579 --> 33:35.479
"business" easy to clean up.

33:35.481 --> 33:36.513
Mm.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.415
And you escaped
the night before.

33:38.417 --> 33:39.716
If I had known you were coming,

33:39.718 --> 33:41.685
I would've stayed
and baked cookies.
Hey.

33:41.687 --> 33:43.220
I have to ask.

33:43.222 --> 33:44.654
Brisco kept me
so high

33:44.656 --> 33:46.456
That I barely remember
crawling out of that place

33:46.458 --> 33:50.127
I found a gun
that he left behind, and...

33:50.129 --> 33:51.661
I hid in a storm drain
across the street

33:51.663 --> 33:53.463
Till the drugs
got out of my system.

33:53.465 --> 33:57.501
Agent dinozzo,
if I was in on this,

33:57.503 --> 33:59.569
Why would I risk coming back
for melody?

34:02.673 --> 34:04.541
You buy this?

34:04.543 --> 34:06.543
Yeah.

34:06.545 --> 34:09.546
But it doesn't help us catch
the son of a bitch who did it.

34:09.548 --> 34:11.348
Cia's disavowed brisco.

34:11.350 --> 34:12.816
Guy's in the wind.

34:12.818 --> 34:16.219
And with troutman's laptop
being erased,

34:16.221 --> 34:17.821
We're back at square one.

34:17.823 --> 34:19.356
We still got troutman.

34:19.358 --> 34:20.824
But we got nothing
to incriminate him, gibbs.

34:20.826 --> 34:22.692
We got nothing to make him talk.

34:26.764 --> 34:30.300
But if that doesn't work,
we lose brisco for good

34:30.302 --> 34:33.403
And any leverage we had
to take out that web site.

34:33.405 --> 34:35.605
It'll work, leon.

34:36.574 --> 34:39.576
I hope you're right.

34:42.413 --> 34:43.413
(clears throat)

34:43.415 --> 34:46.149
Nurse?

34:46.151 --> 34:48.585
Nurse, can I get another
jell-o cup? Orange this time.

34:49.554 --> 34:51.521
That was fast.

34:53.691 --> 34:55.459
Px.

34:55.461 --> 34:57.661
Cia. Talk.

34:57.663 --> 35:00.697
Cia? Badge says "ncis."

35:05.336 --> 35:06.636
Sorry.
Ow!

35:06.638 --> 35:08.138
You know, that's
gonna hurt a lot more

35:08.140 --> 35:09.673
Once the painkillers
wear off.

35:09.675 --> 35:12.809
Ow! Sorry, what's-what's...
What's going on?

35:12.811 --> 35:14.611
We know about your connection
to the phoenician exchange

35:14.613 --> 35:15.779
And officer brisco.

35:15.781 --> 35:17.647
Where is he?
Okay, I must...

35:17.649 --> 35:19.749
Still be a little out of it,
'cause I don't understand

35:19.751 --> 35:21.184
A thing you're saying.

35:21.186 --> 35:22.786
You understand
life in prison?

35:22.788 --> 35:24.754
Ow, ow! Nurse. Nurse!

35:24.756 --> 35:26.756
I think they're
on their lunch break.

35:26.758 --> 35:29.626
We need your server locations
and admin passwords.

35:31.596 --> 35:33.663
Ow, ow, ow, ow...
All right,

35:33.665 --> 35:35.565
I'll give you anything you want.
Just stop, stop, stop!

35:35.567 --> 35:36.766
Locations and passwords.

35:36.768 --> 35:38.502
All right.
All right.

35:38.504 --> 35:41.505
Just-just...
Tell me what those are

35:41.507 --> 35:43.673
And I'll get them.
(sighs) he's playing games.

35:43.675 --> 35:45.242
No, no, no, no,
no, no. I'm not.

35:45.244 --> 35:46.910
Just tell me how to...
How to give them to you.

35:46.912 --> 35:48.912
Do I have to... Do I have
to sign into my aol or...

35:48.914 --> 35:49.913
Aol?

35:51.449 --> 35:52.916
Even you know what that is.

35:56.387 --> 35:58.221
Bishop,

35:58.223 --> 36:00.657
Give me your phone.

36:01.726 --> 36:03.727
(groans)
here.

36:03.729 --> 36:05.562
Call a lawyer.
You're gonna want one.

36:05.564 --> 36:06.930
I can use my phone.

36:06.932 --> 36:09.566
No. Use this one.

36:12.737 --> 36:14.571
(clears throat)

36:16.741 --> 36:18.742
Ah.

36:18.744 --> 36:20.243
Where do I dial?

36:21.679 --> 36:23.480
(sighs) he's not
our computer mastermind.

36:23.482 --> 36:25.582
But his laptop
was wiped.

36:25.584 --> 36:26.950
Someone was hiding their link
to the px.

36:26.952 --> 36:28.685
I don't have a laptop.

36:30.254 --> 36:32.756
So... This...

36:32.758 --> 36:35.792
Belongs to...

36:35.794 --> 36:38.762
I take it back.
That's-that's mine.

36:38.764 --> 36:40.730
That's my laptop.

36:51.375 --> 36:53.810
You supposed
to be meeting someone?

36:53.812 --> 36:56.980
Yeah. Didn't know it
was gonna be a coed.

36:56.982 --> 36:58.715
Turns out,
med school's expensive.

37:00.651 --> 37:02.586
Not what I thought
I was getting into

37:02.588 --> 37:04.721
When I started buying
security intel from you.

37:04.723 --> 37:06.456
Internet's a scary place.

37:06.458 --> 37:07.857
Then I get a tip
from you

37:07.859 --> 37:09.793
That ncis is onto me?

37:09.795 --> 37:12.829
I wouldn't have sent you to
my father's apartment building.

37:15.566 --> 37:17.801
You never said anything
about being cia.

37:17.803 --> 37:20.403
That's the beauty of anonymity.

37:20.405 --> 37:22.005
My money?

37:22.007 --> 37:25.542
And if you're thinking about
negotiating me down, remember...

37:25.544 --> 37:27.410
Tip-offs can go both ways.

37:28.613 --> 37:30.680
I'll give you even more

37:30.682 --> 37:34.451
If you help me
get out of the country.

37:34.453 --> 37:35.752
Please?

37:35.754 --> 37:37.420
I'm sure
you'll figure something out.

37:44.962 --> 37:46.796
Then we're done here.

37:46.798 --> 37:49.766
So if you'll excuse me.

37:49.768 --> 37:50.867
Kid.

37:51.836 --> 37:53.603
Good luck.

37:59.010 --> 38:00.977
Brisco (recorded): My money?
And if you're thinking about

38:00.979 --> 38:02.846
Negotiating me down, remember...
Tip-offs can go both ways.

38:02.848 --> 38:04.748
That good enough?

38:04.750 --> 38:07.717
We got it.

38:07.719 --> 38:09.886
And my plea deal?

38:09.888 --> 38:12.889
Yeah. It's intact.

38:12.891 --> 38:14.624
As long as you give
us the web site.

38:14.626 --> 38:16.359
Turn around.

38:18.329 --> 38:20.697
(handcuffs clicking)

38:35.313 --> 38:37.314
Better pour two.

38:37.316 --> 38:38.915
Jones.

38:38.917 --> 38:42.786
Uh... I'm surprised
you found me.

38:42.788 --> 38:44.954
You were smart not
to go to the feds.

38:44.956 --> 38:46.956
You don't have to
tell them anything.

38:46.958 --> 38:49.859
I was supposed to have
my wedding reception here.

38:51.729 --> 38:52.829
I trusted you!

38:55.499 --> 38:57.400
Mcgee:
It's over, brisco.

38:57.402 --> 38:58.935
(handcuffs clicking)

38:58.937 --> 39:00.337
You were right.

39:00.339 --> 39:01.771
You're nothing
like trent kort.

39:01.773 --> 39:02.806
You're worse.

39:02.808 --> 39:04.874
He never denied
being a worm.

39:06.777 --> 39:09.813
You okay?

39:09.815 --> 39:11.948
Yeah. What time is it?

39:11.950 --> 39:14.117
Uh, almost 5:00. Why?

39:14.119 --> 39:16.386
I need one more favor,
agent mcgee.

39:18.823 --> 39:20.990
(church bell tolling)

39:37.942 --> 39:40.577
(sniffles, sobs)

39:46.117 --> 39:47.517
You ready for this?

39:47.519 --> 39:49.586
I've been ready.

39:52.123 --> 39:54.124
Oh, and I brought cake.

39:54.126 --> 39:56.426
(both laugh)

39:56.428 --> 39:58.795
Hope we made it in time.

39:58.797 --> 40:02.732
I called the judge and
told him the circumstances.

40:02.734 --> 40:04.834
He was willing
to wait.

40:04.836 --> 40:08.872
So, we... Both wanted
to talk to each other.

40:10.007 --> 40:13.543
You go first.

40:13.545 --> 40:16.079
Okay.

40:18.516 --> 40:21.551
I think that you should
go for that job in dubai.

40:23.154 --> 40:24.988
Tony told me
about it.

40:24.990 --> 40:28.725
And if it's what you want,
then I want it for you.

40:29.693 --> 40:31.861
Thank you.

40:33.063 --> 40:35.765
It is.

40:38.035 --> 40:41.805
Ever since my accident,
I've felt like...

40:41.807 --> 40:44.808
A seesaw, back and forth.

40:44.810 --> 40:46.643
Normal and not.

40:46.645 --> 40:49.612
It wasn't until I went back
to work, I realized that...

40:49.614 --> 40:52.081
Normal has changed
because I have.

40:52.083 --> 40:53.750
I get that.

40:53.752 --> 40:56.986
Working on a computer screen
in a dark room...

40:58.789 --> 41:00.824
...That just isn't me anymore.

41:03.961 --> 41:07.730
So I do want
to take the new job.

41:07.732 --> 41:10.667
But that means one big change.

41:12.136 --> 41:14.471
A long-distance relationship?

41:15.239 --> 41:17.106
What?

41:17.108 --> 41:20.610
I'll only go if we can
still make this work.

41:20.612 --> 41:22.812
I know I've changed,

41:22.814 --> 41:26.616
But you haven't, and you're
still the guy I want to be with.

41:26.618 --> 41:29.586
(chuckles softly)

41:29.588 --> 41:30.820
Did I scare you
with that last part?

41:30.822 --> 41:32.689
Yes.
Oh.

41:32.691 --> 41:34.524
(chuckles)
no, I'm kidding.

41:34.526 --> 41:37.794
Um, listen, uh...

41:39.897 --> 41:43.566
I wanted to give these to you
'cause I feel the same way.

41:43.568 --> 41:47.270
Just, now it'll be
for when you get back.

41:47.272 --> 41:48.538
Deal?

41:48.540 --> 41:50.807
Deal.

41:54.044 --> 41:56.813
Jones:
Agent mcgee!

41:56.815 --> 41:58.081
We forgot witnesses.

41:58.083 --> 42:00.149
Any chance
you two can help us out?

42:02.219 --> 42:04.921
Absolutely.
