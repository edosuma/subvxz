00:35.080 --> 00:40.600
Imagine a world where temperatures rise to 120 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:45.200 --> 00:49.480
Where there's no escape from sun, wind and dust.

00:55.120 --> 00:59.920
Imagine a world with almost no food or water.

01:08.920 --> 01:11.160
These are the conditions in

01:11.160 --> 01:14.160
one third of the lands of our planet.

01:17.800 --> 01:22.640
To live here demands the most extraordinary survival strategies.

01:45.560 --> 01:49.720
This is the oldest desert in the world.

01:49.720 --> 01:52.800
The Namib in south-west Africa.

01:53.920 --> 01:57.400
It's been dry for 55 million years.

02:02.440 --> 02:06.520
Life here for a hunter is as hard as it gets.

02:17.040 --> 02:19.480
A pride of lions.

02:19.480 --> 02:23.960
One of the very few that endures this desert's scorching temperatures

02:23.960 --> 02:25.640
and lack of water.

02:42.920 --> 02:46.480
Hunting here presents special problems.

02:52.840 --> 02:57.680
A herd of oryx, the only prey within 20 miles.

03:01.760 --> 03:05.480
Out here, there is no cover for an ambush.

03:05.480 --> 03:08.440
It'll have to be a straight chase.

03:45.200 --> 03:47.240
They have failed

03:47.240 --> 03:51.640
and each failed hunt brings the lions closer to starvation.

04:03.480 --> 04:05.520
To find enough to eat,

04:05.520 --> 04:10.560
the pride continually searches an area the size of Switzerland.

04:19.320 --> 04:26.400
Three days and 100 miles later, and still no kill.

04:28.040 --> 04:30.720
These are desperate times.

04:30.720 --> 04:32.200
BIRDS CAW

04:34.320 --> 04:37.280
A dry riverbed on the edge of their territory.

04:40.720 --> 04:43.960
The only animals here are giraffe,

04:43.960 --> 04:48.840
but these one-tonne giants could kill a lion with a single kick.

05:01.920 --> 05:05.120
Lions seldom tackle such formidable prey...

05:08.200 --> 05:13.080
..but this pride can't go on much longer without food.

05:40.760 --> 05:44.520
The whole pride must work together as a team if they're to succeed.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.520
Two lionesses lead the chase.

06:15.520 --> 06:18.800
Others race to cut off possible escape routes.

06:35.600 --> 06:40.400
The giraffe has the speed and stamina to outrun the pride...

06:41.680 --> 06:44.360
..but it's being chased into a trap.

06:46.600 --> 06:49.560
Up ahead, the lead female waits.

07:00.280 --> 07:02.360
It's now up to her.

07:21.120 --> 07:23.840
Most lion hunts end in failure.

07:25.600 --> 07:30.560
But no lions fail more often than those that live in the desert.

07:34.200 --> 07:38.080
Once again, the pride must continue their search.

07:45.440 --> 07:46.800
THUNDER RUMBLES

08:02.360 --> 08:06.440
It does, sometimes, rain in the desert.

08:09.600 --> 08:15.040
Here, in the American West, storms can strike with devastating force.

08:20.360 --> 08:22.360
After ten months of drought,

08:22.360 --> 08:27.120
millions of tonnes of water are dumped on the land in under an hour.

09:16.840 --> 09:18.560
Over millions of years,

09:18.560 --> 09:21.920
sand and gravel carried by the rampaging floods

09:21.920 --> 09:24.880
have carved channels through the solid rock.

09:29.840 --> 09:33.720
Slot canyons, 150 feet deep.

10:05.920 --> 10:08.960
In some places, these canyons have widened

10:08.960 --> 10:12.920
until the land between them is sculpted into tablelands

10:12.920 --> 10:15.240
and isolated pinnacles,

10:15.240 --> 10:19.200
some of the most dramatic landscapes on the planet.

10:35.880 --> 10:37.880
The rain may be long gone...

10:39.600 --> 10:41.520
..but there is water here...

10:43.240 --> 10:47.360
..locked away within the tissues of specialist desert plants.

10:49.800 --> 10:53.200
Cacti are unique to American deserts.

10:55.400 --> 10:57.280
They all hoard water,

10:57.280 --> 10:59.800
storing it in swollen stems

10:59.800 --> 11:03.280
and protecting it behind a barricade of spines.

11:07.440 --> 11:11.000
They're so successful that they dominate these deserts.

11:13.680 --> 11:16.000
But this forest of spikes can cause

11:16.000 --> 11:18.760
problems for the animals that live here.

11:26.560 --> 11:28.200
A Harrisxxx hawk.

11:31.240 --> 11:35.280
It has developed special techniques for hunting amongst the cacti.

11:41.560 --> 11:43.840
Ground squirrels.

11:43.840 --> 11:44.920
Prey.

11:53.120 --> 11:56.800
At the first sign of danger they bolt for the safety of the thorns.

12:06.600 --> 12:09.280
But the hawks have a tactic to flush them out.

12:12.880 --> 12:16.600
These are the only birds of prey that hunt in packs.

12:19.160 --> 12:23.400
Flying in formation, they try to drive their quarry into the open.

12:34.640 --> 12:37.040
But this squirrel is staying put.

12:43.400 --> 12:46.000
So now the hawks continue the hunt...

12:47.040 --> 12:48.440
..on foot.

12:56.480 --> 12:59.120
They're closing in from all sides.

13:20.640 --> 13:24.120
Soon, all escape routes are cut off.

13:28.320 --> 13:30.120
The squirrel is trapped.

13:41.080 --> 13:44.480
The spines that cover almost every plant in this desert

13:44.480 --> 13:48.080
can provide protection and shelter for many animals.

13:56.080 --> 14:01.080
So, why should these spikes be hung with corpses?

14:07.520 --> 14:09.880
What kind of creature could be responsible

14:09.880 --> 14:12.360
for creating such a gruesome scene?

14:21.760 --> 14:25.520
There's a mysterious killer at work in this desert.

14:32.840 --> 14:34.680
It's a butcherbird.

14:36.440 --> 14:41.960
This little songbird uses the spines as a butcher uses his hook -

14:41.960 --> 14:45.160
to hold its prey as it dismembers it.

14:49.160 --> 14:50.600
CHICKS SQUAWK

14:55.320 --> 14:59.800
And with chicks to feed, he also uses the spines as a larder.

15:05.640 --> 15:07.840
He's been stocking it for weeks.

15:10.960 --> 15:14.840
Hanging his prey out of the reach of scavengers on the ground

15:14.840 --> 15:18.440
ensures that his newly hatched young will never go hungry.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.920
An ingenious solution to making the good times last in the desert...

15:28.040 --> 15:30.160
..if a little macabre.

15:30.160 --> 15:31.280
CHICKS SQUAWK

15:39.040 --> 15:41.360
Some deserts are so arid,

15:41.360 --> 15:44.600
they appear totally devoid of all vegetation.

15:47.520 --> 15:52.480
Yet even these landscapes can be transformed in a matter of days.

16:03.440 --> 16:07.600
The deserts of Peru are amongst the driest in the world,

16:07.600 --> 16:11.560
but just add a little water and plants that have lain dormant

16:11.560 --> 16:14.120
for months will burst into life.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.960
And when a desert suddenly turns green,

16:33.960 --> 16:39.280
even the most seemingly desolate can become a land of opportunity.

16:51.920 --> 16:55.600
No creature exploits the greening of a desert more quickly

16:55.600 --> 16:57.920
or more dramatically than a locust.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.440
Madagascar's arid south-west

17:09.440 --> 17:12.240
has received its highest rainfall in years.

17:18.319 --> 17:21.240
Now, an army is on the march,

17:21.240 --> 17:24.119
attracted by the smell of newly sprouting grass.

17:36.320 --> 17:38.800
Locusts are normally solitary creatures,

17:38.800 --> 17:42.480
but when food becomes suddenly plentiful they come together

17:42.480 --> 17:46.800
into an unstoppable force that devours everything in its path.

18:05.520 --> 18:09.760
But this devastation is about to get a lot worse.

18:21.520 --> 18:26.520
The locusts now transform into winged adults,

18:26.520 --> 18:28.600
and with conditions as good as this,

18:28.600 --> 18:31.760
they do so three times faster than normal.

18:33.280 --> 18:37.560
Now they are at their most voracious...

18:37.560 --> 18:40.520
and with wings, they can take to the skies.

19:05.680 --> 19:09.720
Once airborne, the locusts can travel over 60 miles a day

19:09.720 --> 19:12.120
in their search for new feeding grounds.

19:26.440 --> 19:31.000
A super swarm of this scale may only appear once in a decade.

19:32.360 --> 19:35.760
This one extends over 200 square miles

19:35.760 --> 19:38.680
and contains several billion individuals.

19:40.240 --> 19:44.600
Between them, they will devour 40,000 tonnes of food in a day.

20:20.560 --> 20:24.440
Nothing can strip a land of its vegetation with such speed

20:24.440 --> 20:27.720
and thoroughness as a plague of locusts.

20:30.760 --> 20:35.640
When the food eventually runs out, the whole army will die...

20:35.640 --> 20:38.240
but not before it's devastated the land.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.800
With no plants to bind them,

20:55.800 --> 20:59.520
thin soils soon turn to dust and blow away.

21:06.120 --> 21:10.960
Now, these barren lands are left to the mercy of the elements.

21:27.560 --> 21:32.880
Scorched by the sun and scoured by windblown sand,

21:32.880 --> 21:37.680
desert rock is shaped into strange, otherworldly landscapes.

21:44.240 --> 21:48.320
These rocky deserts may have a beguiling beauty,

21:48.320 --> 21:52.080
but when they become this barren, very little life can endure.

21:59.040 --> 22:03.200
For many animals, the only way to survive the most hostile times

22:03.200 --> 22:04.920
is to keep moving.

22:12.200 --> 22:16.400
In the Kalahari, brief rains have given way to the dry season.

22:17.560 --> 22:20.800
Food and water are becoming increasingly scarce.

22:22.680 --> 22:25.120
For these zebra, it's time to leave.

22:38.120 --> 22:39.480
They're setting off on

22:39.480 --> 22:44.160
the longest overland migration made by any mammal in Africa,

22:44.160 --> 22:47.480
marching towards the scent of distant rains.

22:51.400 --> 22:53.680
As drought intensifies,

22:53.680 --> 22:57.080
desert-living elephants must also undertake long journeys

22:57.080 --> 22:59.080
in search of water.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.600
The older females can remember where,

23:22.600 --> 23:27.600
even in times of extreme drought, there may still be water

23:27.600 --> 23:31.480
and sometimes lead the herd to a water hole they may not have visited

23:31.480 --> 23:32.800
for decades.

24:02.640 --> 24:06.360
These zebra are almost at the end of their journey.

24:13.200 --> 24:15.440
This is what they've been heading for...

24:19.760 --> 24:21.000
..a rare water hole.

24:31.680 --> 24:35.080
In deserts, most water holes are short lived.

24:35.080 --> 24:36.560
They appear after rains,

24:36.560 --> 24:39.320
but then vanish almost as quickly as they came.

24:46.520 --> 24:49.720
Animals have come here from many miles around.

24:54.600 --> 24:59.040
Yet this can be a dangerous place in which to linger.

25:07.440 --> 25:10.520
60 miles away, in the heart of the desert,

25:10.520 --> 25:12.560
sandgrouse chicks are hatching.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.840
It's safer for them to be here.

25:20.880 --> 25:24.120
But being so distant from water is a gamble.

25:27.840 --> 25:30.520
With only their mother to shield them from the sun,

25:30.520 --> 25:34.200
if they get nothing to drink, they will be dead within hours.

25:42.880 --> 25:45.000
Their only hope is their father.

25:48.760 --> 25:52.640
Every morning he makes the 120-mile round trip

25:52.640 --> 25:54.880
to get water for the family.

25:58.440 --> 26:01.960
Grouse from all over the desert visit this oasis,

26:01.960 --> 26:05.200
arriving together in large flocks,

26:05.200 --> 26:06.760
and that is important.

26:10.480 --> 26:12.320
There's safety in numbers.

26:27.520 --> 26:29.800
The male snatches a drink,

26:29.800 --> 26:33.480
but he also needs to collect water for his chicks.

26:34.440 --> 26:36.800
Using specially adapted breast feathers,

26:36.800 --> 26:39.440
he can soak up water like a sponge.

26:40.520 --> 26:43.600
But it takes time, and he is in danger.

26:51.680 --> 26:53.000
Goshawk.

27:09.120 --> 27:11.560
Sandgrouse here are their main prey.

27:17.480 --> 27:22.280
Again and again, the male sandgrouse risk their lives

27:22.280 --> 27:24.760
in order to collect water for their chicks.

27:45.120 --> 27:49.480
This is why sandgrouse nest so far from water holes.

28:13.200 --> 28:16.720
At last, he's soaked up as much as he can.

28:18.400 --> 28:21.440
Carrying a quarter of his body weight in water,

28:21.440 --> 28:24.600
he can now set off on the long journey home.

28:51.360 --> 28:54.120
He's back, and just in time.

28:55.400 --> 28:58.400
He can give the chicks their first ever drink.

29:06.080 --> 29:10.120
But he will have to undertake this perilous journey every day

29:10.120 --> 29:14.480
for the next two months until his chicks can finally make the flight

29:14.480 --> 29:16.680
to the water hole for themselves.

29:29.040 --> 29:33.960
It's July in the deserts of Nevada in the western United States.

29:35.560 --> 29:37.680
The hottest time of the year.

29:51.320 --> 29:54.280
Bands of wild horses, mustang,

29:54.280 --> 29:58.400
are converging on one of the last remaining water holes for miles.

30:03.880 --> 30:07.560
Now, water not only offers them the chance to drink,

30:07.560 --> 30:09.680
it can also bring power.

30:13.240 --> 30:16.640
If a stallion can control access to water,

30:16.640 --> 30:19.480
he will have secured mating rights to the entire herd.

30:21.320 --> 30:24.320
So stallions try to dominate these pools,

30:24.320 --> 30:26.800
fighting off rivals who venture too close.

30:39.760 --> 30:41.160
A stranger.

30:43.040 --> 30:45.480
He's travelled ten miles to be here

30:45.480 --> 30:48.560
because the pools where he's come from have already dried up.

30:52.880 --> 30:54.960
With him come his females.

30:57.520 --> 31:00.200
If he can't provide them with water, they will leave him

31:00.200 --> 31:04.400
for the white stallion who already dominates this pool.

31:14.960 --> 31:17.040
So, he will have to fight.

32:17.560 --> 32:18.960
There is everything to lose.

32:20.880 --> 32:23.080
A broken leg or a shattered jaw

32:23.080 --> 32:25.880
would mean a slow and painful death.

32:46.600 --> 32:49.440
A missed kick, and it's all over.

32:52.080 --> 32:56.280
The new arrival has won...

32:56.280 --> 33:00.520
and his prize is more than just the chance to drink.

33:00.520 --> 33:03.720
He has provided for his herd, and in the process,

33:03.720 --> 33:06.080
stolen his rival's females.

33:07.880 --> 33:10.520
The white stallion's rule is over.

33:18.120 --> 33:22.720
Desert life is not only shaped by the scarcity of water,

33:22.720 --> 33:27.320
but also by the relentless power of the sun.

33:33.840 --> 33:36.200
The highest temperatures on Earth

33:36.200 --> 33:38.840
have all been recorded in its deserts.

33:50.440 --> 33:53.360
Changes in the climate mean temperatures here

33:53.360 --> 33:56.480
are rising more than the global average and,

33:56.480 --> 33:59.760
as deserts heat up, they are also expanding.

34:02.080 --> 34:06.960
Every year, a further 50,000 square miles of grass and farmland

34:06.960 --> 34:10.719
are turning into barren stretches of dust and rock.

34:16.280 --> 34:21.840
In the heat of the day, surface temperatures can reach 160 degrees,

34:21.840 --> 34:24.440
far too hot to handle for most.

34:27.000 --> 34:30.320
But not for this shovel-snouted lizard.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.320
Raising its feet off the ground in turn...

34:40.880 --> 34:43.120
..enables each to briefly cool.

34:49.400 --> 34:52.639
But even this dancing desert specialist

34:52.639 --> 34:54.360
can't stand the heat for long.

35:03.280 --> 35:05.440
One option is to find shade.

35:10.360 --> 35:15.320
Dune grass, the only vegetation here, provides virtually none,

35:15.320 --> 35:18.240
but just an inch beneath the surface of the sand,

35:18.240 --> 35:20.800
it is several degrees cooler.

35:28.280 --> 35:33.160
Avoiding the extreme heat imposes a rhythm on desert life.

35:36.080 --> 35:39.640
And many animals here choose the simplest option of all...

35:42.720 --> 35:44.200
..staying hidden all day,

35:44.200 --> 35:47.160
and only venturing out in the cool of the night.

35:56.240 --> 36:01.080
As darkness falls, animals appear from seemingly nowhere.

36:08.120 --> 36:11.680
And, among them, inevitably,

36:11.680 --> 36:12.880
are hunters.

36:28.000 --> 36:31.440
One of the most voracious nocturnal predators

36:31.440 --> 36:34.800
is also one of the hardest to see.

36:37.160 --> 36:41.720
This mysterious creature hardly ever appears on the surface of the dunes.

36:48.680 --> 36:52.480
But there are signs on the sand that can give it away.

37:06.240 --> 37:09.960
It lives only here, where the sand grains are so perfectly dry

37:09.960 --> 37:13.280
and polished, that they flow almost like water.

37:16.640 --> 37:18.720
It's no bigger than a ping-pong ball.

37:23.320 --> 37:25.000
A golden mole.

37:26.080 --> 37:28.680
It's totally blind,

37:28.680 --> 37:31.000
but there's nothing to see underground anyway.

37:37.520 --> 37:40.080
Instead, it has superb hearing.

37:42.880 --> 37:45.480
Its entire head acts as an amplifier

37:45.480 --> 37:49.800
that picks up vibrations through the sand, so, to locate prey

37:49.800 --> 37:53.280
on the surface of the dune, it has, paradoxically,

37:53.280 --> 37:55.920
to thrust its face into the dune.

38:04.560 --> 38:06.640
Termites.

38:06.640 --> 38:08.800
Not easy to catch when you're blind.

38:12.960 --> 38:15.720
Far better to go into stealth mode.

38:17.440 --> 38:21.760
Once below the sand, it can detect the slightest movement...

38:25.040 --> 38:28.200
..allowing it to strike with pinpoint accuracy.

38:37.360 --> 38:40.400
Well, most of the time.

38:52.040 --> 38:55.960
They can travel two thirds of a mile a night in search of its dinner...

38:59.000 --> 39:02.840
..and right now, it has just detected its main course.

39:04.720 --> 39:08.440
Little wonder it's sometimes called "the shark of the dunes".

39:17.160 --> 39:21.680
Food can be so scarce in the desert that, even at night,

39:21.680 --> 39:25.240
animals can't afford to be choosy about what they eat.

39:31.200 --> 39:33.440
Israel's Negev desert.

39:43.080 --> 39:47.520
Otonycteris, the desert long-eared bat, is on the hunt.

39:51.680 --> 39:56.120
Most bats catch flying insects on the wing, but there are so few

39:56.120 --> 40:00.480
of these in the desert that this bat must do things differently.

40:04.040 --> 40:06.200
It has to hunt on the ground.

40:13.480 --> 40:17.320
But what really sets it apart is what it's hunting...

40:25.280 --> 40:27.120
..a deathstalker scorpion.

40:28.840 --> 40:32.920
The venom of this species is potent enough to kill a human.

40:34.800 --> 40:39.040
Tackling it seems madness for a bat weighing just half an ounce.

40:43.640 --> 40:48.720
In the pitch-black, both predator and prey are effectively blind,

40:48.720 --> 40:51.200
but the scorpion has one advantage -

40:51.200 --> 40:55.720
he can sense the approach of the bat through vibrations in the sand.

40:59.400 --> 41:03.480
Otonycteris must rely entirely on its hearing.

41:04.600 --> 41:07.720
If the scorpion doesn't move, it won't know it's there.

41:22.640 --> 41:23.800
The battle is on.

41:27.000 --> 41:30.680
Armed with crushing pincers and a sting loaded with venom,

41:30.680 --> 41:33.320
this scorpion is a dangerous opponent.

41:46.720 --> 41:48.760
A direct strike on the head.

41:51.480 --> 41:52.760
Is it all over?

41:56.800 --> 41:58.520
Not for this bat.

42:14.080 --> 42:18.080
Otonycteris clearly has some immunity to the venom,

42:18.080 --> 42:21.920
but repeated stings must still be extraordinarily painful.

42:30.080 --> 42:32.120
And if the bat is not to go hungry,

42:32.120 --> 42:35.840
it must catch another three scorpions before sunrise.

43:03.920 --> 43:07.240
Desert animals have developed remarkable strategies

43:07.240 --> 43:10.640
to make the most of the rare opportunities that come their way.

43:13.040 --> 43:16.680
Although some deserts may not see rain for several years,

43:16.680 --> 43:20.200
most will hold a little water in one form or another.

43:21.360 --> 43:24.480
The trick is simply knowing how to reach it.

43:33.280 --> 43:38.520
Dawn in the dunes of the Namib, and something magical is happening.

43:57.160 --> 44:01.880
Moist air lying over the neighbouring Atlantic is cooled

44:01.880 --> 44:06.960
and blown inland, forming fog banks that shroud the desert in mist.

44:14.520 --> 44:18.560
This precious moisture lies tantalisingly out of reach

44:18.560 --> 44:23.080
at the top of the dunes, and it won't last long.

44:23.080 --> 44:27.000
It'll be burnt off by the sun just hours after it rises.

44:42.640 --> 44:45.640
Darkling beetles race to the top of the dunes

44:45.640 --> 44:48.080
to reach the fog before it vanishes.

44:57.480 --> 45:02.000
Some of the Namib's dunes are 1,000 feet high,

45:02.000 --> 45:03.280
the tallest in the world.

45:05.280 --> 45:08.960
For a beetle no larger than a thumbnail, this is the equivalent

45:08.960 --> 45:12.280
of us climbing a dune twice the height of Everest.

45:16.920 --> 45:20.560
But even more impressive is what it does next.

45:25.720 --> 45:28.960
Standing perfectly still, facing into the wind,

45:28.960 --> 45:31.280
the beetle does a headstand.

45:34.680 --> 45:37.400
Fog begins to condense on its body.

45:40.920 --> 45:44.520
Microscopic bumps on its wing cases direct the water

45:44.520 --> 45:46.840
to grooves that channel it towards the mouth.

45:52.640 --> 45:54.840
Before returning down the slip face,

45:54.840 --> 45:57.560
it will drink 40% of its body weight.

46:02.960 --> 46:08.040
This little beetle has learned how to conjure water out of the air

46:08.040 --> 46:10.800
in one of the driest places on earth.

46:14.800 --> 46:17.880
And it's not alone on the top of the dunes.

46:24.400 --> 46:27.200
Web-footed geckos use a similar trick.

46:37.320 --> 46:41.000
Surely, few animals go to greater lengths to get a drink.

46:59.640 --> 47:03.560
Unfortunately, Namaqua chameleons know that on foggy mornings,

47:03.560 --> 47:08.320
the beetles coming down the dunes are juicier than those going up.

47:19.880 --> 47:24.360
The diversity of life that thrives in a world almost totally devoid

47:24.360 --> 47:26.760
of water is truly remarkable.

47:29.720 --> 47:33.640
Success in the desert depends on an extraordinary variety of

47:33.640 --> 47:37.640
survival strategies that have evolved over millions of years.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.480
But our planet is changing.

47:45.360 --> 47:49.440
The world's deserts are growing bigger, hotter and drier,

47:49.440 --> 47:52.320
and they're doing so faster than ever before.

47:54.120 --> 47:59.000
How life will cope here in the future remains to be seen.

48:15.760 --> 48:20.160
Finding animals in these vast empty landscapes was a persistent problem

48:20.160 --> 48:21.800
for the Deserts team.

48:21.800 --> 48:25.000
But surely this wouldn't be the case when they set out to film

48:25.000 --> 48:28.200
one of the greatest concentrations of wildlife on earth.

48:31.200 --> 48:35.760
It can't be hard to find a billion locusts, can it?

48:39.160 --> 48:40.720
OK.

48:40.720 --> 48:43.200
With news that freak rains have triggered

48:43.200 --> 48:46.840
a mass emergence of locusts in a remote part of Madagascar,

48:46.840 --> 48:48.680
the team sets off in pursuit.

48:56.560 --> 48:58.880
We've got some young hopper locusts just crossing the road

48:58.880 --> 49:01.280
in front of us here. We've just had to stop the cars.

49:01.280 --> 49:04.120
Here they are, here, all on the side of the road, look.

49:04.120 --> 49:06.120
It looks promising.

49:06.120 --> 49:08.440
But though finding hoppers is easy,

49:08.440 --> 49:11.000
filming them proves more of a challenge.

49:11.000 --> 49:14.160
Can we rethink this? Because it's not really working.

49:14.160 --> 49:15.880
The locusts are really skippy.

49:15.880 --> 49:18.520
Any kind of movement, they just freak out, So we're now doing

49:18.520 --> 49:21.520
our best locust-herding techniques to try to get them to go

49:21.520 --> 49:24.800
in front of the lens, which is proving harder than anticipated.

49:34.080 --> 49:37.680
This is my Monday morning locust-herding jazz hands.

49:55.080 --> 49:56.920
- Ah! 
- What? What's that?

49:56.920 --> 49:58.320
- What? 
- It's a wasp nest.

50:02.320 --> 50:05.840
Soon, the crew find themselves surrounded by locusts.

50:05.840 --> 50:08.560
No need for jazz hands now.

50:12.640 --> 50:16.520
It's a good start, but the team still need to film the winged swarms

50:16.520 --> 50:18.040
that complete the story.

50:22.520 --> 50:26.040
But, once airborne, they can travel 60 miles a day,

50:26.040 --> 50:28.160
so finding a swarm won't be easy.

50:31.880 --> 50:35.640
Fortunately, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation

50:35.640 --> 50:37.640
are here, too, to help.

50:41.320 --> 50:44.560
The FAO are on a mission to eradicate the plagues

50:44.560 --> 50:47.800
decimating crops across Madagascar,

50:47.800 --> 50:52.520
and if anyone knows where the locusts are,

50:52.520 --> 50:55.880
it's the local expert, Hasibelo.

50:55.880 --> 50:58.520
He thinks that they are moving this way.

51:01.160 --> 51:03.400
Time to go swarm-chasing.

51:06.400 --> 51:09.720
But chasing is the operative word.

51:09.720 --> 51:12.960
The locusts always seem one step ahead.

51:14.720 --> 51:17.080
It's amazing, really, because this plan's completely

51:17.080 --> 51:20.120
radically changing, hour by hour. We now have to travel

51:20.120 --> 51:23.400
several hours further north, which is...

51:23.400 --> 51:25.080
- a bit of a pain. 
- It's a bit of a pain.

51:28.720 --> 51:30.760
As they venture into the unknown,

51:30.760 --> 51:33.760
it's clear it's been a very wet year indeed.

51:40.800 --> 51:45.000
Traffic is one thing, but boats on the road?

51:45.000 --> 51:46.880
Unconventional traffic.

51:51.480 --> 51:54.720
Progress is slow, and soon stops altogether.

52:00.760 --> 52:04.840
The locusts are just across the water, so the team must follow...

52:07.520 --> 52:09.000
..on this.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.200
What could possibly go wrong?

52:18.360 --> 52:22.400
We're now stuck on, possibly, the world's most antiquated raft

52:22.400 --> 52:25.320
trying to cross a very fast-flowing river.

52:25.320 --> 52:27.920
But, onwards and upwards.

52:27.920 --> 52:31.400
We've now got an hour-long river crossing, and we'll just have to see

52:31.400 --> 52:32.840
what's on the other side.

52:49.960 --> 52:53.320
With the river behind them, it should be plain sailing.

52:57.400 --> 53:01.120
But once across, the team discovers that, yet again,

53:01.120 --> 53:03.360
the locusts are nowhere to be seen.

53:10.400 --> 53:12.240
And, after two weeks on the road,

53:12.240 --> 53:15.680
the local street food is beginning to take its toll.

53:19.520 --> 53:23.600
So Ed's not very well. Been yacking up and...

53:24.840 --> 53:27.880
And not very nice stomach.

53:27.880 --> 53:29.520
We just need to do whatever it takes now

53:29.520 --> 53:32.640
to get us to where the swarms are.

53:32.640 --> 53:34.800
The next day, the team forges on.

53:37.080 --> 53:38.360
Briefly.

53:42.600 --> 53:45.000
Here's Jamal, our driver.

53:45.000 --> 53:46.760
What do we think? Yeah?

53:47.800 --> 53:49.440
No?

53:49.440 --> 53:52.600
The road has turned into a bog.

53:52.600 --> 53:55.080
The cars can go no further.

53:55.080 --> 53:58.800
We need to cross this area of water to get to the savanna

53:58.800 --> 54:00.520
and find our locust swarms.

54:01.600 --> 54:04.840
And it's amazing to think that, with the combined might of the

54:04.840 --> 54:10.080
United Nations and the BBC, we are eventually defeated by a puddle.

54:12.080 --> 54:14.040
Back to the drawing board.

54:18.320 --> 54:21.080
Once again, it's Hasibelo to the rescue.

54:22.880 --> 54:24.120
Well, we have a plan.

54:27.920 --> 54:30.400
Taking to the air was never on the cards,

54:30.400 --> 54:32.920
but thanks to the FAO's helicopter,

54:32.920 --> 54:36.280
the team can now play the locusts at their own game.

55:00.160 --> 55:01.280
More smoke?

55:05.080 --> 55:08.040
This time, it's a billion locusts...

55:16.520 --> 55:19.720
..and one very relieved producer.

55:32.720 --> 55:35.560
Woohoo!

55:35.560 --> 55:39.560
Against the odds, the team has located a super-swarm.

55:57.600 --> 56:00.840
This is exactly what we've been looking for. We've driven halfway

56:00.840 --> 56:03.960
across Madagascar to one of the most remote parts there is.

56:03.960 --> 56:07.640
It's just been a nightmare, but, finally, we're here.

56:07.640 --> 56:10.480
I mean, this is the biggest swarm we could have even hoped for.

56:10.480 --> 56:11.880
It is just amazing.

56:11.880 --> 56:13.960
Look at here, I'm going to film here.

56:15.600 --> 56:18.920
It's incredibly exhilarating, and yet totally shocking,

56:18.920 --> 56:22.160
to think of the devastation that swarms like this are causing.

56:22.160 --> 56:25.240
It just makes you realise how important the FAO are

56:25.240 --> 56:27.840
in getting this under control.

56:31.440 --> 56:32.880
I'm just going to run through it.

56:32.880 --> 56:34.840
I should be naked for this, but...

56:49.800 --> 56:54.040
Thankfully, Rob kept his clothes on, and, more importantly,

56:54.040 --> 56:56.440
this plague has now been halted,

56:56.440 --> 57:00.080
but not before the team had witnessed one of the biggest swarms

57:00.080 --> 57:01.440
ever recorded on film.

57:14.320 --> 57:19.200
Next time, we journey to the world's great plains,

57:19.200 --> 57:24.160
where spectacular gatherings of wildlife cope with extreme change...

57:26.520 --> 57:30.840
..and surprising creatures survive in unexpected ways.
