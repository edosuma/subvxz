00:02.212 --> 00:03.380
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

00:03.546 --> 00:05.215
We're onto you, Professor Strange.

00:05.674 --> 00:07.592
<i>Bad guys come in and monsters come out.</i>

00:07.967 --> 00:10.053
I am Firefly.

00:11.262 --> 00:13.390
Selina. Hugo Strange has Selina.

00:14.933 --> 00:17.102
Do you remember your name?

00:17.268 --> 00:18.978
My name is Fish Mooney.

00:19.187 --> 00:23.358
Make me a grilled cheese sandwich.

00:24.901 --> 00:27.362
You made me a sandwich? Why?

00:27.529 --> 00:28.530
I don't know.

00:28.697 --> 00:30.448
And how exactly do you plan on getting
into Arkham?

00:30.615 --> 00:31.616
I'll ask for a tour.

00:31.783 --> 00:33.785
From the man that ordered
the assassination of your father?

00:33.993 --> 00:34.994
<i>He'll wanna find out what we know.</i>

00:35.161 --> 00:36.830
<i>And he won't see me
and Lucius as a threat.</i>

00:37.080 --> 00:39.416
I call Bullock,
he comes busting in with a hundred cops.

00:39.582 --> 00:40.583
Take them.

00:43.586 --> 00:46.589
<i>Move everything you can
to the facility upstate.</i>

00:46.798 --> 00:49.426
<i>You have an explosive device. Use it.</i>

00:49.801 --> 00:51.261
<i>Destroy Indian Hill.</i>

00:51.428 --> 00:54.639
Basil is a chameleon of sorts.
Would you like to see?

01:01.938 --> 01:02.939
You son of a bitch!

01:03.231 --> 01:04.607
I'm Jim Gordon.

01:06.651 --> 01:08.528
Right. Go get our guys.

01:14.451 --> 01:15.493
No sign of Gordon.

01:15.660 --> 01:17.454
<i>How long do you want us to wait?</i>

01:17.620 --> 01:18.663
Give him 10 seconds.

01:18.830 --> 01:21.666
If you don't see Jim,
bust that joint open and find him.

01:21.916 --> 01:23.376
<i>Ready, entry team. We go on one!</i>

01:24.627 --> 01:25.628
- Go!
- Go!

01:39.017 --> 01:40.268
Go. Go!

01:40.477 --> 01:43.354
Four, three, two--

01:44.856 --> 01:46.024
Stand down.

01:47.192 --> 01:50.236
- Stand down, officers.
- Hold. Hold.

01:50.403 --> 01:51.654
Stand down.

01:51.821 --> 01:54.365
- All clear.
<i>- Stand down. Stand down.</i>

01:54.783 --> 01:55.992
All clear?

01:56.159 --> 01:59.579
Sorry to waste your time, hoss.
How about a ride to HQ?

01:59.746 --> 02:00.872
Sure thing, Jim. You okay?

02:02.040 --> 02:03.374
You look kinda hinky.

02:04.083 --> 02:05.210
Never better.

02:08.546 --> 02:10.381
<i>Strange! Strange!</i>

02:10.715 --> 02:14.052
Strange! Strange, you son of a bitch.
Come back here!

02:23.353 --> 02:27.023
- So, you're really doing this?
- Not my call.

02:27.357 --> 02:30.401
Prepare the patients for transport
to the upstate facility.

02:30.568 --> 02:32.237
If even one of your patients
were to escape--

02:32.403 --> 02:34.906
They won't.
The police won't be delayed much longer.

02:35.073 --> 02:36.407
Prepare the patients and move fast.

02:36.574 --> 02:38.076
As soon as we're done
with Gordon and Wayne,

02:38.243 --> 02:39.494
<i>we will detonate the bomb.</i>

02:39.661 --> 02:40.662
Yes, sir.

02:52.590 --> 02:53.842
<i>Uh...</i>

02:54.008 --> 02:56.761
<i>Okay, quiz kids.</i>

02:57.428 --> 03:00.765
<i>Who's ready to play, "Life or Death"?</i>

03:01.015 --> 03:04.102
Sir, Mr. Nygma. You are Nygma, aren't you?

03:04.352 --> 03:06.896
This is absurd. The police know
we're here, you can't kill us.

03:07.105 --> 03:08.356
Are you ready to play?

03:11.818 --> 03:12.944
Yes.

03:13.444 --> 03:14.445
<i>Good.</i>

03:14.696 --> 03:17.615
<i>You have one guess,
five minutes to talk it over.</i>

03:18.116 --> 03:22.036
Who runs Indian Hill?

03:24.289 --> 03:28.710
<i>Who runs Indian Hill? You have one guess.</i>

03:29.043 --> 03:30.837
Think carefully, fellas.

03:31.921 --> 03:33.381
<i>Answer correctly,</i>

03:34.591 --> 03:35.633
<i>or die.</i>

03:37.010 --> 03:39.012
Strange.

03:39.304 --> 03:41.514
- Strange?
- Hi.

03:46.978 --> 03:48.271
What is that?

03:48.855 --> 03:50.148
Honesty serum.

03:50.815 --> 03:54.485
- I need to know what you know.
- Wait. Wait.

04:04.120 --> 04:05.330
So, how do you feel now?

04:07.457 --> 04:08.625
Not good.

04:09.417 --> 04:11.628
Can you be more specific?

04:13.796 --> 04:15.089
I feel vulnerable.

04:16.090 --> 04:17.091
Naked.

04:17.258 --> 04:20.511
Your feelings are entirely
natural and normal.

04:21.262 --> 04:23.556
There is nothing to be ashamed of.

04:23.723 --> 04:28.227
You are in a helpless situation.
There is nothing you can do.

04:28.394 --> 04:31.356
Do you understand that?

04:31.522 --> 04:32.857
Yes.

04:34.776 --> 04:36.694
- No.
- No?

04:37.236 --> 04:38.363
What can you do?

04:40.365 --> 04:42.992
James, what can you do?

04:43.534 --> 04:46.788
- Made a plan.
- Tell me your plan.

04:47.538 --> 04:49.666
If I don't check in with the GCPD by noon,

04:50.917 --> 04:52.251
tell them I'm safe,

04:53.169 --> 04:54.629
they'll come after you.

04:55.880 --> 04:57.090
Yes.

04:57.757 --> 04:58.883
Yes, I know.

04:59.801 --> 05:02.595
<i>You did check in with the GCPD.</i>

05:03.054 --> 05:04.639
Nobody's coming.

05:06.891 --> 05:08.559
You can relax.

05:17.443 --> 05:19.570
Jim! Jim!

05:21.781 --> 05:24.117
- Harv.
- Strange is clean?

05:24.283 --> 05:25.910
What the hell happened?

05:26.077 --> 05:28.079
- Dead end.
- "Dead end"?

05:28.788 --> 05:30.999
What are you talking about? Dead end?

05:31.499 --> 05:34.210
- He's connected.
- So is my mechanic. Who isn't?

05:34.752 --> 05:37.880
- Connected to people we can't cross.
- What people?

05:38.715 --> 05:39.882
You don't wanna know.

05:41.342 --> 05:42.510
Trust me.

05:43.594 --> 05:46.264
You feelin' all right?
You look like a sack of fish.

05:46.806 --> 05:48.057
A little flu, maybe.

05:48.266 --> 05:49.517
Oh. Keep your distance.

05:49.684 --> 05:52.145
I'm getting laid this weekend.
Fingers crossed.

05:55.356 --> 05:57.442
<i>You have 60 seconds left.</i>

05:57.608 --> 06:00.236
<i>Who runs Indian Hill?</i>

06:03.823 --> 06:05.366
I say, Hugo Strange.

06:05.575 --> 06:08.119
Wayne Enterprises.
Wayne Enterprises runs Indian Hill.

06:08.286 --> 06:09.287
That's surmised.

06:09.454 --> 06:11.247
Why would he ask that question
if the answer was obvious?

06:11.414 --> 06:12.582
He wants to know what we know.

06:12.957 --> 06:15.126
- What we think we know.
- Which is Wayne Enterprises.

06:15.293 --> 06:17.128
Is that your answer?
Running out of time here.

06:17.295 --> 06:18.296
Yes.

06:21.632 --> 06:22.675
Correct!

06:22.842 --> 06:26.179
<i>Wayne Enterprises runs Indian Hill.</i>

06:27.472 --> 06:28.473
Bravo, Brucey.

06:28.639 --> 06:32.060
<i>You're almost safe.
Just one more question.</i>

06:32.226 --> 06:33.436
- You ready?
- Yes.

06:33.603 --> 06:36.272
<i>You have five minutes, quiz kids.
Answer correctly or die.</i>

06:37.482 --> 06:43.404
Wayne Enterprises runs Indian Hill,
but who runs Wayne Enterprises?

06:54.665 --> 06:56.417
Move 'em out in order of security grades.

06:56.959 --> 06:58.669
Lowest risk, first.

06:58.836 --> 07:01.005
Tranq 'em, immobilize them,
and put them on the bus.

07:01.172 --> 07:04.092
And do it fast, but very, very carefully.

07:04.258 --> 07:07.053
Security is our number-one priority.

07:07.220 --> 07:08.221
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

07:10.223 --> 07:12.350
- Hey, lady.
- Busy day, busy day.

07:12.517 --> 07:14.185
We'll get to you, number 13.

07:14.352 --> 07:18.481
Your mama may be number 13,
but I'm a human being.

07:19.357 --> 07:21.692
Fish Mooney, bitch.

07:27.365 --> 07:28.491
Here,

07:29.200 --> 07:31.702
you're reanimant test case number 13.

07:32.328 --> 07:34.622
And I'm Ms. Peabody.

07:36.707 --> 07:39.293
And you best not talk about my mama.

07:40.211 --> 07:42.046
Ms. Peabody,

07:43.506 --> 07:44.882
I apologize.

07:45.925 --> 07:49.345
I'm a bit stressed.
I don't like being locked up.

07:50.304 --> 07:52.390
It's against my nature.

07:52.557 --> 07:54.433
I understand, I do.

07:54.600 --> 07:58.896
But you are a priceless,
scientific miracle.

07:59.063 --> 08:00.731
You are history.

08:01.357 --> 08:04.402
Seclusion is regrettable but inevitable.

08:04.694 --> 08:07.405
Look, I've been here before.

08:07.572 --> 08:10.992
All you mad scientists
say the same kind of stuff.

08:11.409 --> 08:12.743
I don't care.

08:13.744 --> 08:14.912
Let me go.

08:19.625 --> 08:20.668
Sorry, 13.

08:21.460 --> 08:22.879
Let's go.

08:24.422 --> 08:29.510
You're messing with the wrong woman.
You hear me? The wrong woman.

09:03.169 --> 09:04.170
Here?

09:04.462 --> 09:06.464
A little too central, maybe?

09:06.672 --> 09:09.050
You don't want one piece
to overpower the room.

09:09.592 --> 09:10.927
<i>Try over there.</i>

09:19.560 --> 09:20.853
You're absolutely right.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.898
See, I told you she'd be useful.
Isn't that better?

09:25.483 --> 09:27.193
Interior design ain't my thing.

09:27.568 --> 09:29.904
<i>News on the hour with WTGC.</i>

09:30.071 --> 09:33.658
<i>Police sources say that reports of
an impending raid on Arkham Insane Asylum</i>

09:33.824 --> 09:36.911
<i>and its controversial chief,
Professor Hugo Strange, are inaccurate.</i>

09:37.328 --> 09:38.496
<i>Despite the disclaimers,</i>

09:38.663 --> 09:42.124
<i>flurries of police activity around
the troubled facility have fueled...</i>

09:42.291 --> 09:45.670
Hugo Strange.

09:49.507 --> 09:50.675
How interesting.

09:55.471 --> 09:58.182
Answer quickly, please, Jim,
without thinking.

09:58.349 --> 09:59.976
Who did you love more,
your mother or your father?

10:00.393 --> 10:01.644
- Mother.
- Why?

10:01.936 --> 10:03.896
I resented my father's strength.

10:04.063 --> 10:07.191
- I see, yes. And when he died...
- Yes.

10:07.358 --> 10:08.526
...how did you feel?

10:08.693 --> 10:10.194
- Guilty.
- For a car crash?

10:10.361 --> 10:12.029
Why? It was not your fault.

10:12.196 --> 10:14.573
I imagined he was gone and then he was.

10:14.865 --> 10:17.618
- You lost a child recently.
- Yes.

10:17.827 --> 10:19.495
How does that make you feel?

10:20.788 --> 10:21.789
Guilty.

10:22.790 --> 10:25.042
Guilt, again. You blame yourself?

10:25.209 --> 10:26.377
It was my fault.

10:26.836 --> 10:28.838
Oh, I see, I didn't know that.

10:29.005 --> 10:30.715
And what happened to the mother?

10:30.881 --> 10:32.091
Lee, was it?

10:32.258 --> 10:35.094
She's down south somewhere.

10:36.053 --> 10:38.139
- You still love her?
- Yes.

10:38.306 --> 10:39.890
- You want to be with her?
- Yes.

10:40.057 --> 10:41.267
Why aren't you with her?

10:42.643 --> 10:44.353
I've put her through enough pain.

10:45.229 --> 10:48.274
Jim, I need you to relax.

10:49.692 --> 10:51.360
Close your eyes.

10:52.903 --> 10:56.073
Imagine that I am God.

10:57.825 --> 10:59.744
All powerful.

11:00.411 --> 11:01.871
I am God,

11:02.038 --> 11:06.417
and I absolve you of all of your guilt.

11:06.792 --> 11:09.754
I put that guilt on you. And now...

11:11.464 --> 11:13.174
I take it away.

11:14.342 --> 11:18.429
It's gone. Your burdens are gone.

11:22.933 --> 11:24.435
So, how do you feel?

11:26.145 --> 11:27.563
Good. Better.

11:28.606 --> 11:29.774
Good.

11:30.483 --> 11:32.276
Good. Good.

11:34.153 --> 11:35.404
Jim,

11:36.947 --> 11:40.951
now that we're relaxed
and speaking honestly, tell me,

11:41.118 --> 11:44.622
what do you know about
our work here at Indian Hill?

11:45.498 --> 11:48.042
You're building monsters for military use.

11:48.209 --> 11:50.544
Oh, we're doing much more than that.
But for who?

11:51.921 --> 11:53.506
Who owns Indian Hill?

11:54.298 --> 11:55.674
Wayne Enterprises.

11:55.883 --> 11:59.303
And who controls Wayne Enterprises
behind the scenes?

12:00.554 --> 12:03.140
Who controls everything in Gotham?

12:03.974 --> 12:05.768
Behind the scenes.

12:06.268 --> 12:07.311
I don't know.

12:09.146 --> 12:12.400
- The rich.
- Well, they are rich, I'm sure.

12:12.566 --> 12:14.485
But can you be more specific?

12:17.655 --> 12:19.824
Who controls Gotham, Jim?

12:24.829 --> 12:25.830
You've never heard of a...

12:28.332 --> 12:30.459
Secret council?

12:31.836 --> 12:33.254
Secret council?

12:35.089 --> 12:36.090
No.

12:37.967 --> 12:39.176
Excellent.

12:40.010 --> 12:41.929
Excellent. Thank you.

12:42.471 --> 12:44.181
That's what I needed to know.

12:44.890 --> 12:46.100
Professor Strange?

12:47.017 --> 12:49.019
- Yes, Jim?
<i>- What you said about Lee,</i>

12:50.271 --> 12:51.814
I should've gone after her?

12:52.189 --> 12:53.816
Oh, no doubt.

12:54.650 --> 12:58.696
Guilt has compelled you to sacrifice
your heart to your conscience,

12:58.863 --> 13:00.448
but guilt is useless.

13:02.199 --> 13:03.742
Love, Jim.

13:05.369 --> 13:07.455
Love is our guide.

13:11.417 --> 13:12.543
Time's up, I'm afraid.

13:13.043 --> 13:15.087
In the spirit of intimacy and honesty,

13:15.254 --> 13:20.176
I have been speaking about your life
as if it had a future,

13:21.886 --> 13:23.012
and that is not so.

13:26.307 --> 13:28.392
You have a few hours.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.606
You have 30 seconds left.

13:33.856 --> 13:35.691
<i>Who runs Wayne Enterprises?</i>

13:35.900 --> 13:37.943
The Devil, maybe.
Is that the deal?

13:38.110 --> 13:39.111
<i>Communists? Witches?</i>

13:39.278 --> 13:42.114
No, there's some trick
behind his question. Some big secret.

13:42.281 --> 13:43.824
I've worked for Wayne Enterprises
for 10 years.

13:43.991 --> 13:44.992
There is no big secret.

13:45.159 --> 13:46.911
The board of directors
runs Wayne Enterprises.

13:47.077 --> 13:48.204
Fifteen seconds.

13:48.370 --> 13:49.830
That can't be the answer, Lucius!

13:51.207 --> 13:53.751
<i>- Ten seconds.</i>
- Give us more time!

13:54.084 --> 13:56.086
- Five seconds!
- The board of directors.

14:01.717 --> 14:03.052
Incorrect.

14:03.385 --> 14:05.763
<i>Oh, what a shame.</i>

14:06.013 --> 14:07.598
The correct answer is...

14:12.853 --> 14:14.855
Sorry, fellas. You lose.

14:15.648 --> 14:17.775
<i>And what happens to losers?</i>

14:18.150 --> 14:19.318
Yowza!

14:20.528 --> 14:23.113
<i>Death by poison gas.</i>

15:38.522 --> 15:40.232
Jim. Jim.

15:41.942 --> 15:43.944
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:45.237 --> 15:47.031
Are we alive?

15:47.364 --> 15:48.574
So far, so good.

15:49.199 --> 15:51.160
Had to be sure. Thought we were dead.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.914
Wow. That was unpleasant.

15:56.874 --> 16:00.377
How are things going for you?
We've had a hell of a time.

16:00.711 --> 16:01.795
Same.

16:02.671 --> 16:04.715
- You okay?
- A little groggy.

16:05.382 --> 16:07.718
He drugged me. Made me talk.

16:07.968 --> 16:10.721
- About Wayne Enterprises, right?
- About everything.

16:11.764 --> 16:12.890
Bruce,

16:14.058 --> 16:15.934
I never should have made that oath to you.

16:16.101 --> 16:18.228
- That's not really--
- I was arrogant and naive,

16:18.729 --> 16:19.980
and I'm sorry.

16:20.522 --> 16:22.483
I've tried to do the right thing, but...

16:24.068 --> 16:25.611
What a fool I've been.

16:26.403 --> 16:27.404
Uh...

16:29.490 --> 16:31.575
What kinda drugs did they give you?

16:32.409 --> 16:34.912
Oh, well done, Ed. I'm impressed.

16:35.079 --> 16:38.499
You're a shaman of sorts, a witch doctor.

16:38.666 --> 16:41.293
So, just between us,
who does run Wayne Enterprises?

16:41.502 --> 16:45.089
I could tell you,
but then I would have to lobotomize you.

16:46.799 --> 16:47.966
Gotcha.

16:48.133 --> 16:49.968
So, moving forward, sir,
I would be more than happy to help you

16:50.135 --> 16:51.136
with any of your other cases.

16:51.303 --> 16:53.972
You would be a wonderful addition
to my staff, Ed.

16:54.139 --> 16:56.725
A wonderful addition,
if you were only sane.

16:57.726 --> 16:59.812
- No, seriously.
- Yes, seriously.

16:59.978 --> 17:01.271
You have been very useful,

17:01.438 --> 17:04.066
and we arrogant physicians
have much to learn

17:04.233 --> 17:06.443
from a mad man like you.

17:07.277 --> 17:08.404
But not that much.

17:08.612 --> 17:11.907
No, no, no. No!
You will not turn me into a crazy person!

17:12.116 --> 17:13.117
No!

17:13.450 --> 17:15.953
Madam, I bring good news.

17:16.203 --> 17:19.707
Gordon and Wayne and Fox
know nothing but mundanities.

17:19.873 --> 17:23.627
They have told no one the truth
because they have none of the truth.

17:29.341 --> 17:31.051
Our secret is safe.

17:34.096 --> 17:35.139
<i>Kill them all.</i>

17:35.305 --> 17:38.142
<i>Then continue with the evacuation
of your test subjects.</i>

17:38.642 --> 17:40.144
Yes, madam.

17:40.310 --> 17:42.646
<i>The destruction of Indian Hill
will proceed as scheduled.</i>

17:42.896 --> 17:45.899
<i>Releasing Galavan
was a grave error on your part.</i>

17:46.483 --> 17:51.029
<i>No more of your patients will see
the light of day under any circumstances,</i>

17:51.196 --> 17:52.656
<i>at any cost.</i>

17:54.825 --> 17:56.660
I understand, madam.

18:04.418 --> 18:06.628
These people to whom Strange is connected,

18:06.795 --> 18:08.839
they must be pretty heavy
to make you back off.

18:10.340 --> 18:12.092
Oh, they're heavy.

18:12.259 --> 18:15.387
I don't want anything dangerous,
I just like being titillated.

18:15.554 --> 18:17.431
Seriously, you don't wanna know.

18:17.723 --> 18:19.767
Remember the time
you called me from the hospital

18:19.933 --> 18:21.351
when you had Falcone on the gurney,

18:22.269 --> 18:25.856
and the whole town and their uncle
were looking to kill you both?

18:28.484 --> 18:31.361
- How could I forget?
- Remember what I said to you on the phone?

18:31.862 --> 18:33.030
Remember what I said?

18:34.740 --> 18:35.824
I forget.

18:36.408 --> 18:38.952
- That's funny.
<i>- Gordon, you're back.</i>

18:39.745 --> 18:42.122
What happened? Where's Master Bruce?
Where's Lucius?

18:42.998 --> 18:44.708
Where are they? Have you seen them?

18:44.875 --> 18:46.752
- Hey, Alfred, take it easy.
<i>- Where are they?</i>

18:46.919 --> 18:50.130
Alfred. Alfred, relax.

18:50.380 --> 18:53.550
Master Bruce and Lucius are, uh,
headed back to Wayne Manor.

18:53.717 --> 18:55.511
Yeah, well, that's a load of old tosh,
for starters, innit?

18:55.677 --> 18:56.678
I've just come back from there.

18:56.845 --> 18:59.473
What can I tell you?
Maybe they stopped to get a snack.

18:59.890 --> 19:02.726
- So? What about Strange?
- It's complicated.

19:03.310 --> 19:04.728
Well, go on, then. What?

19:06.146 --> 19:08.023
Complicated police business!

19:11.401 --> 19:12.861
He's got a touch of the flu.

19:23.747 --> 19:24.748
You.

19:32.714 --> 19:34.758
- How you doing?
- Middling.

19:35.634 --> 19:37.511
- What's your deal?
- Chillin'.

19:39.221 --> 19:42.808
They're gonna blow this dump sky-high,
and the whole circus is moving upstate.

19:43.100 --> 19:44.768
- When?
- Soon.

19:44.935 --> 19:45.936
Like, an hour.

19:46.186 --> 19:48.146
- Can you escape?
- Of course.

19:48.313 --> 19:51.483
Firefly thinks I'm her sidekick,
so I got a trustee status.

19:51.650 --> 19:52.651
Then please do so.

19:52.818 --> 19:54.486
- Get out of here and call the police.
- I'll do what I like.

19:54.653 --> 19:55.654
I led you into this mess,

19:55.821 --> 19:58.907
I was self-righteous and arrogant
and manipulative.

19:59.074 --> 20:01.118
- I used you, and I'm sorry.
- Like you can use me.

20:01.660 --> 20:03.370
I got you wrapped around my pinkie.

20:04.955 --> 20:06.123
Always have.

20:07.583 --> 20:09.126
Be that as it may...

20:09.877 --> 20:11.295
If you can escape, do it.

20:11.503 --> 20:13.839
"Manipulative."

20:14.798 --> 20:15.924
As if.

20:19.136 --> 20:20.220
What'd she say?

20:21.305 --> 20:22.806
She'll do what she likes.

20:25.809 --> 20:27.477
And there's a bomb.

21:05.641 --> 21:07.142
Hello, number 13.

21:07.684 --> 21:08.685
Stay calm.

21:10.228 --> 21:12.522
No one's going to hurt you.

21:13.148 --> 21:15.025
It's time to go on a trip.

21:16.109 --> 21:17.319
Give me your right arm.

21:28.956 --> 21:30.207
Say my name.

21:30.624 --> 21:31.917
Fish Mooney.

21:32.626 --> 21:33.794
That's right.

21:37.255 --> 21:40.509
- What's your name?
- Ethel Peabody.

21:41.635 --> 21:44.721
Ethel, you seem sad

21:45.639 --> 21:46.640
and anxious.

21:46.807 --> 21:48.517
You got that right.

21:48.684 --> 21:52.562
You let me out of here,
and I'll be your friend.

22:16.461 --> 22:19.464
Oh, no, no, no.

22:25.554 --> 22:30.350
Oh. Interesting.
Ms. Peabody, what are you doing?

22:30.517 --> 22:33.478
- What she says.
- Why?

22:34.312 --> 22:35.439
I don't know.

22:36.148 --> 22:39.776
Ms. Mooney, you have special talents.

22:39.985 --> 22:43.280
<i>Some form of psychotropic chemical agent
on your skin, I imagine.</i>

22:43.530 --> 22:46.908
You are marvelous. Yes, truly marvelous.

22:47.075 --> 22:49.661
- Always was.
- Indeed.

22:49.828 --> 22:53.165
Would love to chat about me,
but we have a bus to catch.

22:53.331 --> 22:56.293
Ah, no, Ms. Mooney,
if you and the others on that bus

22:56.460 --> 22:59.504
were to appear in public,
you would cause a revolution.

22:59.671 --> 23:00.881
<i>An apocalypse.</i>

23:01.048 --> 23:03.467
I simply can't allow you
to just walk out of here.

23:04.217 --> 23:06.470
- Watch me.
- No, please don't go.

23:06.762 --> 23:09.931
Please, you're breaking my heart.
I love you like my own daughter.

23:10.098 --> 23:11.141
No one could love you more,

23:11.308 --> 23:14.227
but I will have to kill you
before I let you go.

23:14.394 --> 23:17.022
Please choose life.

23:17.272 --> 23:20.025
You would have made a great pimp.

23:21.193 --> 23:23.278
No, no, no. No!

23:24.362 --> 23:25.781
Bring him back.

23:34.498 --> 23:38.335
Hugo, I order you to stop. Now.

23:40.712 --> 23:42.130
Stop, now!

23:42.798 --> 23:43.799
You hear me?

24:12.828 --> 24:15.080
<i>Security systems activated.</i>

24:15.247 --> 24:17.916
<i>Security systems activated.</i>

24:21.586 --> 24:22.587
No!

24:30.887 --> 24:32.722
I tried calling about 1,000 times.

24:33.265 --> 24:34.391
Still no answer.

24:34.558 --> 24:36.101
Strange has them, I'm positive.

24:36.268 --> 24:38.687
Holy crap, are you still here?

24:38.854 --> 24:41.898
I told you 1,000 times, Strange is clean.

24:42.732 --> 24:43.900
You in charge of that, are you?

24:44.317 --> 24:47.779
That's strange though, isn't it?
I mean, strange they're MIA.

24:47.946 --> 24:49.072
Ah! That's funny.

24:50.240 --> 24:51.408
- "Strange."
- "Funny"?

24:51.575 --> 24:54.119
You know, maybe I should send
the Strike Force back into Arkham,

24:54.327 --> 24:56.329
- to have a little look-see.
- No, no, no. You don't wanna do that.

24:56.496 --> 24:59.040
Bad idea.
Trust me, that's a terrible idea.

24:59.958 --> 25:01.251
How long you known me?

25:02.002 --> 25:05.463
All right, if you're good,
I guess I'm good.

25:05.672 --> 25:08.008
I don't know what's got to you, Gordon,
but you're just...

25:10.051 --> 25:11.219
Weird.

25:11.386 --> 25:12.387
Hey, Alfred.

25:13.763 --> 25:15.891
- Miss Kean.
- How's the butlering business?

25:17.893 --> 25:19.936
- To what do we owe the--
- Jimmy, my love.

25:20.103 --> 25:23.106
I'm sure you're ever so busy,
but could we have a word in private?

25:26.526 --> 25:27.611
You bet.

25:31.823 --> 25:33.116
Well, you look terrible.

25:33.366 --> 25:35.619
Hey, thanks, Barbara,
you look pretty good.

25:35.785 --> 25:37.204
Shucks.

25:37.370 --> 25:39.539
Question, what the hell's going on
down at Arkham?

25:39.706 --> 25:44.794
Two questions back at you, gorgeous.
Why you askin', and what's in it for me?

25:44.961 --> 25:48.381
I'm askin' because a dear friend of mine
wants to know the answer.

25:49.507 --> 25:51.509
And what would you like
to be in it for you?

25:51.676 --> 25:53.929
Hey, spring is here, baby.

25:54.638 --> 25:57.933
- So, now you like me again?
- What's not to like?

25:58.433 --> 26:01.144
- So, you've forgotten about Lee?
- "Lee"?

26:03.396 --> 26:04.648
Lee Thompkins.

26:04.856 --> 26:07.817
Screw that hoe.
Water under the bridge.

26:08.485 --> 26:09.569
You're not Jim.

26:10.612 --> 26:12.781
- Say what now?
- You're not Jim.

26:14.115 --> 26:15.992
Whoa, whoa. Hold on there, woman.

26:18.453 --> 26:20.747
- Holy mother of saints!
- Holy cow!

26:31.299 --> 26:32.842
Kill the captives. We have to go.

26:33.260 --> 26:34.386
Whoa, whoa. Where are we going?

26:34.552 --> 26:35.762
- What's the hurry?
- Silence.

26:36.179 --> 26:38.223
Freeze, get it done.

26:38.765 --> 26:41.351
- Jeez. Relax. What's with him?
- Quiet.

26:41.977 --> 26:42.978
Quiet, yourself.

26:43.728 --> 26:46.314
Why do you have to kill them?
Why are you so mean?

26:46.481 --> 26:49.109
I knew I shouldn't have spared you.
Freeze.

26:49.401 --> 26:50.402
Kill her.

26:52.070 --> 26:54.281
- Wait a minute.
- I'm sorry, Firefly.

26:54.447 --> 26:56.533
I told you she was an experiment.

26:56.700 --> 26:58.535
But she is my friend, I need her.

27:01.913 --> 27:03.206
We don't have time for this.

27:03.373 --> 27:05.709
Please don't let him hurt me, Firefly.

27:07.377 --> 27:08.837
<i>Please help me.</i>

27:09.004 --> 27:10.005
Don't you dare.

27:14.259 --> 27:16.011
Out of the way, Sparky.

27:17.304 --> 27:19.889
- Make me.
- Firefly, no!

27:21.141 --> 27:22.225
No!

27:38.408 --> 27:39.743
What now?

27:41.036 --> 27:42.537
Sounds like warfare.

27:46.666 --> 27:47.667
What's going on?

27:48.293 --> 27:49.669
Simple psychology.

27:50.128 --> 27:52.172
Been waiting for the right moment.

27:53.965 --> 27:55.967
You coming or what?

28:15.862 --> 28:17.614
<i>Fifteen minutes to detonation.</i>

28:18.782 --> 28:21.284
<i>Fifteen minutes to detonation.</i>

28:33.296 --> 28:34.297
Strange.

28:35.298 --> 28:36.341
Strange!

28:42.472 --> 28:44.307
Wake up. Strange.

28:45.350 --> 28:46.351
Strange.

28:55.527 --> 28:59.656
Alpha and Charlie squads to Arkham.
Bravo and Delta to Indian Hill.

28:59.864 --> 29:00.990
Move!

29:01.157 --> 29:02.325
Hey, Penguin,

29:02.492 --> 29:06.621
so it turns out
our Mr. Strange is a very bad man.

29:07.247 --> 29:08.665
The police are on to him now.

29:08.832 --> 29:12.836
They figure he's planning to run,
but he won't, thanks to me.

29:13.002 --> 29:16.131
Thank you, Barbara. You have pleased me.

29:19.175 --> 29:22.595
Saddle up, Butch.
We've got an old friend to catch.

29:27.684 --> 29:30.019
Wake up, Strange. I know you're in there.

29:30.353 --> 29:31.479
Wake up.

29:33.231 --> 29:34.607
Oh, Gordon.

29:34.774 --> 29:37.861
I surmise my plan must have gone awry.

29:38.027 --> 29:39.028
You could say.

29:39.195 --> 29:40.280
I'm gonna stand you up now,

29:40.447 --> 29:42.657
and you're gonna give us
a tour of your secret lab.

29:42.824 --> 29:44.492
- No.
- You don't have a choice.

29:46.786 --> 29:48.413
- It's this way, right?
- Jim, we can't go down there.

29:48.580 --> 29:51.708
I set a bomb, the lab is going to blow up.
We have to get out of here!

29:51.875 --> 29:55.670
In 10 minutes, everything within
a quarter-mile radius will be dust.

29:55.879 --> 29:56.880
That's madness.

29:57.046 --> 30:00.925
If you want to live, which I do, frankly,
we had better leave.

30:01.092 --> 30:02.802
We detected radioactive material
down there.

30:03.011 --> 30:05.263
- You got it out first, right?
- There wasn't enough time.

30:05.430 --> 30:07.182
They forced my hand.

30:07.348 --> 30:11.311
But I calculated the chances
of a radioactive cloud as fairly low.

30:11.478 --> 30:13.188
If you're wrong,
thousands of people could die.

30:13.354 --> 30:17.400
Yes, yes, yes.
But paying that price will be better.

30:18.234 --> 30:20.570
Releasing what's down there...

30:20.737 --> 30:21.738
How do we shut it down?

30:21.905 --> 30:23.364
The security walls are up,
the lab is sealed.

30:23.531 --> 30:26.034
- There must be some way in.
- We have to go.

30:26.201 --> 30:27.452
We have to leave now.

30:27.619 --> 30:29.579
You tell me how to get that bomb
and shut it off,

30:29.746 --> 30:31.414
or I'll batter you to death right here!

30:32.040 --> 30:33.958
In which case, young man,

30:34.959 --> 30:38.254
I suppose I will just have to die.

30:40.882 --> 30:42.675
Wait, Nygma knows the way down there.

30:47.222 --> 30:48.765
- Could use some help.
- Yep.

30:49.557 --> 30:52.936
You two, you've got nine minutes.
Get as far away from here as you can.

30:53.102 --> 30:54.395
- No.
- Go, go!

30:54.604 --> 30:55.980
Lucius, this way.

31:01.027 --> 31:02.570
Yes, of course I know how,

31:02.737 --> 31:04.948
but what is with all the hoo-ha?
What is the rush here?

31:05.114 --> 31:06.115
Just do it.

31:12.789 --> 31:14.290
What do I get if I do it?

31:14.791 --> 31:15.959
You get to live.

31:17.585 --> 31:18.670
Fair enough.

31:22.382 --> 31:24.467
<i>Security systems deactivated.</i>

31:27.637 --> 31:29.138
<i>Security systems deactivated.</i>

31:40.108 --> 31:42.068
You any good at defusing bombs?

31:42.819 --> 31:44.529
I don't know yet. You?

31:49.576 --> 31:51.578
<i>Two minutes to detonation.</i>

31:53.246 --> 31:55.707
<i>Two minutes to detonation.</i>

32:17.812 --> 32:19.188
Oh, my...

32:20.898 --> 32:22.191
Got any ideas?

32:23.318 --> 32:24.360
You got a knife?

32:25.987 --> 32:26.988
No.

32:31.618 --> 32:34.078
<i>We're on approach
to Arkham for patient evacuation.</i>

32:34.245 --> 32:35.747
<i>We need that Bomb Squad ASAP.</i>

32:51.554 --> 32:52.555
What now?

32:53.056 --> 32:54.057
You're asking me?

32:56.309 --> 32:59.812
How about we just pull all this stuff off
and see what happens?

33:00.563 --> 33:02.440
There's no cutoff, bro, maybe.

33:02.607 --> 33:04.359
Maybe, there's no tamper-proofing program.

33:04.609 --> 33:05.610
Yeah.

33:06.527 --> 33:07.570
Yeah.

33:12.325 --> 33:13.326
No.

33:15.244 --> 33:16.245
Water.

33:17.914 --> 33:19.916
- Need water.
- Water.

33:23.920 --> 33:26.547
What's going on? Hello!

33:26.923 --> 33:28.049
Twenty-five seconds.

33:40.728 --> 33:41.729
Fifteen seconds.

34:08.798 --> 34:12.427
Please, I need water.

34:13.886 --> 34:14.887
Water.

34:15.680 --> 34:17.056
I need water.

34:47.003 --> 34:48.212
Hello!

34:49.672 --> 34:52.258
Hello!

34:53.468 --> 34:55.511
Hello! Guys!

34:56.345 --> 34:57.930
What's going on?

35:00.725 --> 35:02.393
Hello!

35:03.519 --> 35:06.022
Where are my people? Where are my people?

35:06.939 --> 35:09.400
You don't understand.
We have to find my people.

35:10.651 --> 35:12.904
There'll be... There'll be consequences.

35:15.907 --> 35:17.825
You heroic son of a bitch!

35:18.201 --> 35:19.702
A nuclear bomb? Huh?

35:20.495 --> 35:22.497
- You'll never guess what took us so long.
- Problem.

35:23.539 --> 35:26.709
Whatever was down there,
whoever was down there in Indian Hill,

35:27.001 --> 35:28.211
they're not there anymore.

35:28.544 --> 35:30.588
Couple of squad cars
are in pursuit of a bus

35:30.838 --> 35:32.215
that left the Indian Hill's compound.

35:32.882 --> 35:35.885
- That's got to be them!
- That bus cannot get away.

35:43.434 --> 35:46.896
<i>Unit 12 in pursuit of Arkham bus
heading south along the D line.</i>

35:48.773 --> 35:50.650
<i>Come in, Unit 12.</i>

35:53.486 --> 35:55.112
<i>...squad, get ready!</i>

35:56.739 --> 35:57.740
<i>Can't make any mistakes here.</i>

36:03.913 --> 36:05.873
<i>Civilian traffic ahead. It's blocked in.</i>

36:22.348 --> 36:23.516
Hold them at the cross street.

36:26.519 --> 36:28.271
<i>Nothing. I'll check up ahead.</i>

36:28.980 --> 36:31.566
<i>Car 32 to Captain Bullock,
heading east towards...</i>

36:31.732 --> 36:33.526
- Damn, damn!
- What's on that bus, Jim?

36:33.693 --> 36:35.778
- Tell me, what's on the bus?
- Monsters.

36:36.112 --> 36:37.488
Come on. Monsters?

36:37.905 --> 36:40.950
Hugo Strange would rather destroy
half the city than let them out.

36:41.200 --> 36:42.285
And now, they're out.

36:43.744 --> 36:46.956
Code Red, Code Red. All units,
to Penford Highway!

36:47.248 --> 36:50.793
<i>All units be on the lookout for
the Indian Hill bus on Penford Highway.</i>

36:50.960 --> 36:52.336
<i>Captain Bullock,
I got eyes on the bus.</i>

36:52.503 --> 36:54.171
<i>Under the South Burnside Expressway.</i>

36:54.463 --> 36:57.341
<i>Well, then stop the damn thing!
Don't let it get away!</i>

37:09.854 --> 37:11.063
Come to mama!

38:02.198 --> 38:04.033
Professor Strange!

38:04.992 --> 38:06.535
Professor Strange!

38:07.787 --> 38:08.788
Come out.

38:10.414 --> 38:12.625
Strange, we need to talk.

38:13.876 --> 38:16.587
You did a very bad thing to me.

38:17.213 --> 38:19.215
And now, you're going to pay!

38:28.391 --> 38:29.475
Impossible.

38:33.062 --> 38:36.148
Nothing is impossible.

38:44.323 --> 38:45.408
Holy...

38:47.827 --> 38:50.079
- Bitch...
- No.

38:53.791 --> 38:54.792
Hmm.

38:58.129 --> 39:00.589
This city's in deep trouble
if we don't find that bus.

39:00.923 --> 39:02.758
- So let's find it.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

39:03.009 --> 39:05.928
I want squadrons at 20,
in these quadrants here.

39:06.721 --> 39:08.139
I want choppers in the air.

39:08.389 --> 39:10.433
I want TAC units on all...

39:11.100 --> 39:12.101
Bruce.

39:18.107 --> 39:19.233
I have to go.

39:20.192 --> 39:23.279
I might not see you for a while,
but I'll try to stay in touch.

39:24.196 --> 39:25.281
Where are you going?

39:25.698 --> 39:26.907
I have to find Lee.

39:27.616 --> 39:28.826
Right move, mate.

39:30.286 --> 39:32.455
Do me a favor.

39:32.621 --> 39:34.123
Say goodbye to Bullock for me.

39:34.373 --> 39:36.459
I don't really want
the whole Celtic farewell.

39:37.251 --> 39:38.461
<i>He's gonna have his hands full,</i>

39:39.795 --> 39:41.047
but I think he can handle it.

39:42.298 --> 39:43.424
Will do.

39:55.478 --> 39:56.687
<i>Chocolates!</i>

39:58.314 --> 40:00.274
Girls like chocolates.

40:01.358 --> 40:02.485
I'll keep that in mind.

40:04.945 --> 40:07.573
Well, there's a man who's
got his priorities straight.

40:09.325 --> 40:10.785
The love of a good woman and all that.

40:12.369 --> 40:15.623
Well, I hope you learned
your lesson, Master Bruce.

40:16.415 --> 40:19.168
And that's the end of your adventures
with the police, eh?

40:22.379 --> 40:23.631
There's a secret council, Alfred.

40:24.340 --> 40:26.217
A secret council that
runs everything in Gotham.

40:26.634 --> 40:27.760
Oh, bloody hell.

40:28.010 --> 40:29.345
It's them that wanted me dead.

40:30.179 --> 40:32.848
We're so close, Alfred.
We're so close to the ultimate truth.

40:33.516 --> 40:36.435
- Oh, bloody hell.
- Hey, don't look at me.

40:41.690 --> 40:42.817
Right.

40:43.818 --> 40:44.819
Right.

40:46.153 --> 40:47.321
<i>Jim, hey!</i>

40:48.030 --> 40:49.365
Hey, where you going?

40:50.116 --> 40:51.117
Hey.

40:51.367 --> 40:52.660
We got monsters to find.

40:52.952 --> 40:54.870
And you'll find 'em. I have to go.

40:55.454 --> 40:56.831
But the city's in danger!

40:57.456 --> 41:00.668
You got this, I know you do.
And I have more important things to do.

41:00.960 --> 41:02.419
- And Harvey--
- Yeah?

41:03.212 --> 41:04.421
You're the boss now.

41:05.548 --> 41:06.966
Maybe get a haircut?

41:15.808 --> 41:17.059
That's my car.

41:17.518 --> 41:19.019
That's my car!

41:19.562 --> 41:20.980
Hey! Jim!

41:35.327 --> 41:36.537
<i>Help.</i>

41:37.329 --> 41:38.330
<i>Help.</i>

41:40.249 --> 41:42.710
Oh, those poor souls.

41:45.087 --> 41:47.673
Hello? Hello?

42:06.817 --> 42:07.818
Oh!

42:47.066 --> 42:48.067
Thank you.

43:44.873 --> 43:45.874
