The Magicians...

00:03.128 --> 00:04.539
To go back to 40,
you're gonna want

00:04.630 --> 00:06.542
to turn this dial
three clicks to the right.

00:06.632 --> 00:07.668
Tell Kady I love her.

00:07.758 --> 00:10.421
Pete? You're Lovelady?

00:11.136 --> 00:12.343
This is the Black Market?

00:12.429 --> 00:14.637
You'd be surprised
what you can find in here.

00:14.723 --> 00:17.090
- Josh, I didn't...
- Didn't mean to hurt me?

00:17.184 --> 00:18.391
Yes, you did.

00:18.477 --> 00:20.969
Believe it or not, I know
exactly who you are, Margo.

00:21.063 --> 00:22.063
Who's she?

00:22.147 --> 00:23.558
- That's Carol.
- That's Carol?

00:25.901 --> 00:27.437
Poppy Kline. Draconologist,

00:27.528 --> 00:29.565
<i>post-graduate fellow
and field researcher.</i>

00:35.536 --> 00:37.243
Hey! Who are you?

00:37.329 --> 00:39.662
Why am I having
these stupid dreams?

00:42.084 --> 00:43.200
Harriet?

00:46.421 --> 00:47.502
Sheila Cozener?

00:47.589 --> 00:48.955
You've been a busy girl.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.415
They have my friend Sheila.

00:50.509 --> 00:51.545
I know.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.591
I need your help.

01:10.946 --> 01:14.189
Jesus, based on the novel Christ,
by Sapphire!

01:14.283 --> 01:15.899
What? What are you
doing here?

01:15.993 --> 01:17.575
I thought you
needed some help.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.244
You're welcome, by the way,
for risking regicide.

01:20.330 --> 01:21.821
Help? But you just
wished me well

01:21.915 --> 01:24.532
on my "solo-op,"
not a day ago.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.751
I had a good think
about that, Fen.

01:27.838 --> 01:30.672
- Oh.
- And, uh, these dreams you've been having,

01:30.757 --> 01:33.215
who are they really about?

01:33.302 --> 01:36.466
Well, I dreamed of a bunny
with its throat all...

01:36.888 --> 01:38.095
Me, Fen.

01:38.432 --> 01:41.641
- Hmm.
- Talking animals are my constituency,

01:41.727 --> 01:45.391
and your next dream was
about my birthright lizard.

01:45.522 --> 01:48.105
Oh, I also dreamt about Josh.

01:48.191 --> 01:50.934
Fucking up some shit he was
supposed to be cooking for me.

01:52.154 --> 01:55.488
Sorry, it's... I just thought
that, it was, you know,

01:56.533 --> 01:57.740
my quest.

01:59.453 --> 02:00.694
Okay.

02:00.787 --> 02:03.325
On the off chance,
then I'm your wing woman.

02:03.415 --> 02:04.872
Right.

02:06.376 --> 02:09.163
I don't mean to pry,
but, uh, speaking of Josh...

02:10.505 --> 02:11.505
Are you and he...

02:11.590 --> 02:13.206
- We're fine.
- Not fighting?

02:13.300 --> 02:15.166
Fen, Josh is a guy I banged,

02:15.260 --> 02:17.126
and when a woman
of a certain caliber,

02:17.220 --> 02:19.382
and a certain skill set
bangs a guy like Josh,

02:19.473 --> 02:21.886
or basically anyone who
isn't a complete sociopath,

02:21.975 --> 02:23.216
they get a little weird.

02:25.103 --> 02:26.344
It'll pass.

02:26.438 --> 02:28.179
Okay, so it's not about...

02:28.273 --> 02:32.108
Fen, don't accuse me
of catching feelings.

02:32.194 --> 02:33.856
All right?
It's insulting.

02:33.945 --> 02:35.356
Okay. Sorry.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.029
Well, if we're both here,

02:37.407 --> 02:39.023
who'll run the kingdom?

02:39.117 --> 02:40.403
Josh.

02:45.791 --> 02:47.282
Don't forget your little knife.

02:49.127 --> 02:50.163
Okay.

02:50.253 --> 02:52.245
So all of a sudden,
you need my help?

02:52.339 --> 02:54.171
Yes, it really
must be you.

02:54.257 --> 02:56.590
As long as this doesn't end
with you arresting me.

02:56.677 --> 02:57.713
It won't.

02:57.803 --> 03:00.637
And does end with you letting
my friend Sheila Cozener go.

03:00.722 --> 03:03.055
She hasn't done anything wrong,
just the opposite.

03:03.141 --> 03:04.882
You should get
Zelda to promise

03:04.976 --> 03:06.638
to bury the woman's book,
as well.

03:06.728 --> 03:09.266
Otherwise they can
always find her again.

03:09.606 --> 03:10.687
And you.

03:10.982 --> 03:13.725
Zelda needs your knowledge
of the Mirror World.

03:14.361 --> 03:17.729
Your experience is, well,
exceedingly rare.

03:19.116 --> 03:20.357
Who's in the Mirror World?

03:21.076 --> 03:22.076
Harriet.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.361
The Fuzzbeater?

03:25.789 --> 03:27.621
Who undermined everything
that you believe in.

03:28.458 --> 03:31.041
She's always had
a strong spirit.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.832
Like her mother.

03:34.589 --> 03:35.589
Oh.

03:36.341 --> 03:37.341
I didn't know.

03:37.426 --> 03:39.383
She didn't want you to.

03:39.803 --> 03:42.090
Look, those who go
into the Mirror World

03:42.180 --> 03:44.137
rarely find their
way out, but you did.

03:44.224 --> 03:47.137
- I hoped you could...
- Recap my time as a monster?

03:47.978 --> 03:50.015
Funny. When I offered you
my notes before,

03:50.105 --> 03:51.346
you said you had everything.

03:51.440 --> 03:54.933
I didn't know then
how much I didn't know.

03:56.194 --> 03:59.107
I went in to find her.
I found something else.

03:59.448 --> 04:01.735
Like reflections,
but incomplete.

04:02.826 --> 04:04.692
Wrong, warped.

04:04.786 --> 04:06.402
I called them shards.

04:06.997 --> 04:09.410
When you're in there
long enough, it refracts you.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.661
Those weren't her,
they were echoes.

04:12.169 --> 04:13.910
You need to track down
the real her,

04:14.004 --> 04:15.586
but that'll be a problem.

04:15.672 --> 04:16.672
Why?

04:16.757 --> 04:18.839
Doing magic in there
is insanely dangerous.

04:18.925 --> 04:20.507
When I was a Niffin, I...

04:23.555 --> 04:25.262
I experimented.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.886
It's easy for a spell
to go haywire.

04:28.560 --> 04:31.678
Bounce around,
kill everything in its path,

04:31.772 --> 04:33.513
pretty gruesomely.

04:35.484 --> 04:37.897
What you need to do
is pull her out.

04:37.986 --> 04:39.727
Good. How?

04:40.989 --> 04:42.275
I might have something.

04:43.241 --> 04:45.949
If Zelda has agreed
to your terms, of course.

04:46.369 --> 04:47.905
Free Sheila,
then bury her book.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.282
Yes.

04:49.414 --> 04:51.701
And an extra month's supply

04:51.792 --> 04:54.535
of campus-wide rations,
every semester.

04:54.628 --> 04:55.744
A month? That's...

04:58.715 --> 05:02.004
Fine. Agreed. The spell?

05:02.093 --> 05:06.463
It turns an ordinary object
into sort of a beacon.

05:07.057 --> 05:09.765
Relies on very
specific connections between people.

05:09.851 --> 05:10.887
In fact,

05:11.812 --> 05:13.303
the only person
in this room

05:13.396 --> 05:15.433
with any shot
of pulling this off

05:15.524 --> 05:17.390
is you, Alice.

05:17.484 --> 05:18.644
What does that mean?

05:19.069 --> 05:20.856
Well, something I suspect

05:20.946 --> 05:23.484
you're not going
to enjoy in the least.

05:43.468 --> 05:46.757
It is not a
good morning, America.

05:47.097 --> 05:48.759
Because of you,
I stopped doing

05:48.849 --> 05:49.849
anything fun
to this body,

05:49.933 --> 05:53.347
so why is my inside
full of angry ants?

05:53.436 --> 05:54.622
Well, you're probably
going through

05:54.646 --> 05:58.185
withdrawal from
drinking, drugs...

05:58.275 --> 05:59.356
More drugs would help.

05:59.442 --> 06:00.978
No.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.731
No drugs. We have a deal.

06:02.821 --> 06:04.653
That you would
help me find a god,

06:04.739 --> 06:06.776
and that I wouldn't
hurt this body anymore,

06:06.867 --> 06:10.531
but your eyes were closed,
so not helpful.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.782
No deal.

06:12.873 --> 06:13.954
Yes, drugs.

06:14.040 --> 06:18.159
No. Look, I found
some leads. Okay?

06:18.628 --> 06:19.789
Um...

06:20.797 --> 06:22.709
Charlemagne's Globus Cruciger

06:22.799 --> 06:24.193
You know, it...
That could have been a...

06:24.217 --> 06:26.880
I give you a mummy
and you give me guesses.

06:27.512 --> 06:28.798
The mandrake god is dead.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.509
Finding his piece
should be easy.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.559
I just need another day.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.474
Please.

06:41.943 --> 06:44.856
There's a man in the TV
who deserves my wrath.

06:45.989 --> 06:49.198
I'll be back when
I'm done with him.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.655
That was not super dignified.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.206
If you have any ideas,

06:57.292 --> 07:00.501
we're looking for
an ancient artifact

07:00.587 --> 07:02.044
that was lost
to the Black Market

07:02.130 --> 07:03.462
a few hundred years ago.

07:03.548 --> 07:05.164
Actually, I...

07:05.258 --> 07:06.999
I do know a guy.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.086
But...

07:10.180 --> 07:12.092
Julia's not gonna like it.

07:12.849 --> 07:15.091
Pete? He's

07:15.560 --> 07:18.052
untrustworthy and
a creep. No!

07:18.146 --> 07:21.139
Actually, I go
by Lovelady now.

07:21.232 --> 07:23.519
It's just,
we're not really

07:23.610 --> 07:25.897
in a position
to refuse help right now.

07:26.613 --> 07:27.694
Fine.

07:27.781 --> 07:30.569
You guys can
deal with Lovelady.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.867
I'm getting a drink.

07:37.999 --> 07:40.457
She made Lovelady
sound lame.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.372
What'd you find?

07:42.462 --> 07:44.624
Okay...

07:44.714 --> 07:46.455
We have this rock.

07:46.549 --> 07:48.791
Petrifies anything
it touches.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.005
Mmm-mmm.

07:50.095 --> 07:51.882
And I know you said,
"stone organ."

07:51.972 --> 07:55.386
This is a pipe organ,
extremely cursed.

07:55.809 --> 07:56.890
No.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.309
Okay, this doesn't
look like much,

07:58.395 --> 08:00.057
but legend has it

08:00.146 --> 08:02.479
there's a lot of power
trapped inside.

08:02.565 --> 08:05.273
But no one knows
how to crack it open.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.476
Yes, Pete, this is it.

08:06.569 --> 08:08.185
Well, you're not gonna
believe this,

08:08.279 --> 08:11.818
but it's actually in the hoard
of a dragon, which are real.

08:11.950 --> 08:13.942
- Oh, yeah, we know.
- Yeah, I've met three.

08:14.035 --> 08:15.651
Oh, you...

08:15.745 --> 08:19.034
Okay. Uh, this dragon,
though, is in New York.

08:19.124 --> 08:21.116
The Hudson tunnels.
Yeah, I've met her.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.290
No, East River.

08:22.669 --> 08:25.286
- Ugh.
- Garbage dragon, got it.

08:25.380 --> 08:27.542
So how do we get an audience?

08:27.632 --> 08:29.919
You talk to her herald.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.842
The dragon has an assistant?

08:31.928 --> 08:34.419
9:00 a.m. Bring something
to trade.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.346
Great, so we have
a few hours

08:36.433 --> 08:38.220
to find something
to impress a dragon.

08:40.352 --> 08:44.063
There's gotta be
something around here.

08:44.149 --> 08:45.606
Your friends are lovely.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.979
Well, after this, we're even.

08:48.862 --> 08:53.277
You saved my life, so...
No, not quite.

08:53.950 --> 08:55.441
What?
You're surprised?

08:55.535 --> 08:58.994
You thought I was
a complete selfish prick?

08:59.080 --> 09:01.663
What do you really
know about me?

09:01.750 --> 09:02.750
Oh, right.

09:02.834 --> 09:05.167
That I was a fucking
great lieutenant to Marina.

09:05.253 --> 09:07.540
What I am is loyal.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.121
To the right person.

09:11.092 --> 09:13.300
- And that's me?
- Could be.

09:13.386 --> 09:16.049
You ready to graduate
from helping your college buds

09:16.139 --> 09:18.256
to solving a real crisis?

09:18.349 --> 09:20.591
Like what's happening
with the hedges.

09:20.685 --> 09:23.974
When one hedge blows up
a Library branch, shit gets bad.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.680
Who knew?

09:25.815 --> 09:28.523
- Does the Library know who did it?
- No.

09:28.610 --> 09:30.693
So we're all terrorists.

09:31.946 --> 09:33.608
They're making
Library cards mandatory,

09:33.698 --> 09:34.698
outlawing spells...

09:34.783 --> 09:35.864
You're right.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.319
We gotta do something.
Turn Whitley in.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.573
She did it.

09:41.331 --> 09:42.572
She stood here and said

09:42.665 --> 09:44.657
she would make them pay
for killing her boyfriend.

09:44.751 --> 09:48.165
They did kill her boyfriend.
They almost killed me.

09:48.254 --> 09:51.292
They deserve to pay.
She did us a favor.

09:51.382 --> 09:53.465
She made life harder
for all of us.

09:54.010 --> 09:57.003
Look, I'm on
the Library's list.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.588
I can't turn her in.

10:00.350 --> 10:01.511
But you can.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.057
Take the heat
off of everyone

10:05.146 --> 10:07.138
until we figure out
what to do next.

10:11.152 --> 10:14.065
Twenty-three.
Thought you bailed.

10:14.155 --> 10:17.865
Just, you know,
figuring some shit out.

10:18.576 --> 10:21.785
So, Shoshana, she...

10:21.871 --> 10:23.237
She get you solved?

10:24.040 --> 10:26.623
Mmm, she's dead.

10:26.709 --> 10:28.996
I'm sorry.
That's heavy.

10:29.087 --> 10:30.498
Yeah, it is.

10:30.588 --> 10:32.295
Still no answers.

10:32.382 --> 10:34.874
No closer to what I am.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.630
And Eliot's still alive,

10:36.719 --> 10:40.133
but that means we have
to help The Monster.

10:40.223 --> 10:41.885
Which is why I'm drinking.

10:45.436 --> 10:48.144
I could use a drink, too.

10:48.231 --> 10:50.894
I have a real fun message
to deliver.

10:54.112 --> 10:55.728
Hey.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.233
Where've you been?

10:57.323 --> 10:59.189
Timeline jumping.

10:59.284 --> 11:03.119
I actually met your Penny.

11:04.372 --> 11:08.332
He's, well,
dead, but good.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.836
And he asked me to tell you
that he's sorry.

11:14.090 --> 11:15.672
And he loves you.

11:17.051 --> 11:19.418
In other words,
not coming back, right?

11:21.055 --> 11:23.172
That's...

11:24.225 --> 11:26.182
What am I supposed
to do with that?

11:31.941 --> 11:36.185
Truth is, he was pretty
broken up about it.

11:36.279 --> 11:39.863
He asked
that you let him go.

11:42.827 --> 11:44.034
He's proud of you.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.413
He knows you're moving on,
taking charge.

11:47.498 --> 11:50.536
You're gonna find
your way and...

11:52.170 --> 11:53.286
Be happy.

11:56.925 --> 11:59.212
God, what the fuck
does he know?

12:11.231 --> 12:12.438
Oh!

12:13.149 --> 12:16.483
- Well, this is just what I needed today.
- Hi, Mom.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.063
I went to get a Library card

12:20.156 --> 12:22.614
and they treated me like
the mother of a criminal,

12:22.700 --> 12:25.408
which I guess I am now.

12:25.495 --> 12:27.828
- What did you tell them?
- What is there to tell?

12:27.914 --> 12:31.248
I never see you unless
you need something.

12:33.294 --> 12:35.456
It's just a simple
cooperative spell.

12:36.798 --> 12:38.881
And yet you came all this way.

12:38.967 --> 12:42.051
Okay, it requires a mother
and a daughter.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.421
Well, you could say "please."

12:46.349 --> 12:48.341
Fine. Please.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.344
I'm afraid we have to
make it quick. I have plans.

13:01.197 --> 13:03.405
Wow, you've really done
a lot with this place.

13:03.491 --> 13:04.823
Well, the Library helped me

13:04.909 --> 13:07.447
redo Daniel's
architectural spells

13:07.537 --> 13:08.994
and his protection wards.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.821
You mean that crazy
lockdown spell

13:10.915 --> 13:12.827
Dad installed after
he saw <i>The Purge?</i>

13:14.085 --> 13:17.829
I'm alone now, Alice.
A defenseless widow.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.498
What's that?

13:21.259 --> 13:24.297
The Library put that in after
the Modesto Act of Terror.

13:24.387 --> 13:26.674
Keeps track of magic use.

13:26.764 --> 13:28.050
So you take their handouts,

13:28.141 --> 13:29.723
and in exchange you
let them spy on you?

13:29.809 --> 13:32.142
The gas company keeps
a meter behind the garage.

13:32.228 --> 13:34.561
Are they spying on me?

13:34.647 --> 13:37.310
The Library
saved magic, Alice.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.232
They provide a resource.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.811
Who cares if they keep track
of who uses it?

13:41.904 --> 13:43.736
They gave you
extra magic for that?

13:43.823 --> 13:46.065
You always resented
my flowers.

13:46.159 --> 13:50.324
You're both pretty.
You both deserve my attention.

13:50.413 --> 13:51.699
Jesus Christ, Stephanie.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.642
I don't give a shit about
your stupid ditch weeds.

13:53.666 --> 13:54.873
Lives are at stake.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.370
Let's get started.

14:00.089 --> 14:01.625
I mean, sure it's enchanted,

14:01.716 --> 14:04.254
but what's a dragon gonna do
with a human-sized telescope?

14:04.385 --> 14:06.923
- I don't know. I'm all out of baby teeth.
- Hello?

14:07.013 --> 14:09.573
Yes, we are going to be delayed indefinitely.

14:09.599 --> 14:10.599
Please hold.

14:10.683 --> 14:13.096
No, no, not until
we've located the item.

14:13.186 --> 14:14.246
I'm gonna have to
call you back.

14:14.270 --> 14:16.478
Please hold. Please hold, I...

14:16.564 --> 14:18.351
This is not a good time.

14:18.441 --> 14:20.774
It has to be now.
You the herald?

14:20.860 --> 14:24.854
I'm Harold, the herald
of the East River Dragon.

14:24.947 --> 14:27.030
I responded to a confusingly
worded help-wanted ad.

14:27.116 --> 14:29.073
Can we just talk to your boss?

14:29.160 --> 14:31.322
- We're closed, sir.
- I... Just come on.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.119
We have an emergency.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.698
Regarding an item
that perhaps you've lost,

14:35.792 --> 14:36.908
or someone may have stolen?

14:37.543 --> 14:39.330
Yeah, we could help.
We could find it.

14:39.420 --> 14:41.252
Nice offer, but
I doubt you can.

14:41.339 --> 14:43.626
- Just tell us what got stolen.
- Yeah.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.127
Come on. We're professionals.

14:48.971 --> 14:52.135
This elixir is worth
more than both of you.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.966
The Great Lady
of the East River

14:54.060 --> 14:55.346
will give you
whatever you choose

14:55.436 --> 14:57.223
if you recover it.

14:57.313 --> 14:58.849
But you won't.

14:58.940 --> 15:01.728
The thief used this.

15:01.818 --> 15:03.730
It's untrackable.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.360
Can I see that?

15:09.242 --> 15:10.733
We can do this.

15:10.827 --> 15:12.159
<i>You seem confident.</i>

15:12.245 --> 15:13.347
Yeah, well,
his tracking spell failed

15:13.371 --> 15:14.848
because he used
the wrong circumstances.

15:14.872 --> 15:16.454
He didn't know
where the thief got this.

15:16.541 --> 15:17.998
- Which is?
- Fillory.

15:18.084 --> 15:19.200
Oh.

15:19.293 --> 15:20.784
Hello? Yes. Right away.

15:26.634 --> 15:27.634
Oh.

15:28.845 --> 15:30.802
- Are you the lady from...
- Your dreams?

15:35.935 --> 15:37.301
So, you're a prophet?

15:37.395 --> 15:40.559
And a cat-type person?

15:40.648 --> 15:42.856
Did I appear in
your dreams as well?

15:42.942 --> 15:46.561
Wait, you don't know
if you were in my dreams?

15:46.654 --> 15:49.488
It was rhetorical.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.408
You desire your future.

15:53.494 --> 15:56.532
See, you're just
stating the obvious.

15:58.374 --> 15:59.490
A vision.

15:59.584 --> 16:01.496
You are leaving.

16:01.586 --> 16:04.044
You did not earn
what you're here to seek.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.042
No, no, no, ignore her.

16:06.132 --> 16:08.374
I will do anything.

16:10.553 --> 16:13.967
The vision changes.
You're celebrating.

16:14.056 --> 16:18.175
You stand on a stone path
that you will lay.

16:19.353 --> 16:24.018
Next to a roof, you re-thatch.
Near a garden, you will plant.

16:25.276 --> 16:26.276
So, to get a prophecy

16:26.360 --> 16:28.522
we have to landscape
your yard. Huh?

16:29.071 --> 16:31.734
- Your wish is...
- My command.

16:33.743 --> 16:34.743
Small note?

16:34.827 --> 16:36.747
Your whole predicting-what-
we're-gonna-say thing

16:36.787 --> 16:38.949
- is a tad...
- Annoying.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.202
Oh, you're good.

16:50.134 --> 16:54.253
Poppy. What are you doing
in the Physical Kids cottage?

16:55.723 --> 16:56.867
I've been meaning
to reach out.

16:56.891 --> 16:59.508
Notice you got
magic back. Amazing.

16:59.602 --> 17:01.842
They didn't have an appropriate
thank-you card at Target.

17:02.480 --> 17:05.598
So, you got this in Fillory
and used it to rob a dragon?

17:05.691 --> 17:08.398
Uh, no. Why would I?

17:08.486 --> 17:09.977
Because you're
a dragon-obsessed

17:10.070 --> 17:11.471
crazy person
who does selfish things

17:11.531 --> 17:12.851
- for personal gain.
- Oh, please.

17:12.906 --> 17:16.617
Name one example of...
Wait, don't.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.785
I remember.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.612
You're literally dripping
with sweat,

17:20.705 --> 17:22.742
which is usually
a pretty good sign

17:22.833 --> 17:23.977
that somebody's
hiding something.

17:24.001 --> 17:26.084
Okay, fine. You caught me.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.040
Happy?

17:34.929 --> 17:37.546
Hello? Q?

17:38.599 --> 17:40.636
- Anyone?
- Hey.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.592
What are you doing here?

17:42.687 --> 17:43.687
What are you?

17:43.771 --> 17:45.478
You were supposed
to be back hours ago.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.022
Kady had to cast a locator.

17:47.108 --> 17:48.895
Somebody moved
this entire cottage.

17:48.985 --> 17:50.772
Right, uh, sorry.

17:50.861 --> 17:53.569
Things just got
so complicated.

17:53.656 --> 17:55.739
- Is that chili?
- Yeah.

17:55.825 --> 17:56.865
Will you just give me a...

17:56.909 --> 17:58.821
Will you just excuse
me for a second? Um...

18:03.916 --> 18:05.407
- Oh, hey, there.
- Oh, hello.

18:06.252 --> 18:07.959
- Belly.
- Okay.

18:08.045 --> 18:11.004
Before you ask, yes,
it was my tranquilizer dart.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.877
But some douchewad
stole it from me.

18:12.967 --> 18:14.458
I would never
cross a dragon.

18:14.552 --> 18:16.043
I'm not an idiot.

18:17.346 --> 18:18.928
Um, but what are
you doing here?

18:19.015 --> 18:21.177
I needed a place
to gestate,

18:21.267 --> 18:24.226
and I'm, hmm, technically
still enrolled, so...

18:29.150 --> 18:32.689
Julia, we have some news.

18:32.778 --> 18:36.021
I'm going to be a dad.

18:44.415 --> 18:48.079
Well, this is some serious
Mr. Miyagi bullshit.

18:48.169 --> 18:52.163
But wasn't Mr. Miyagi
actually training Daniel-san

18:52.256 --> 18:54.043
for his big fight
against Cobra Kai?

18:54.133 --> 18:56.796
Do you think we're learning
secret fighting skills?

18:56.886 --> 18:59.128
When did you watch
<i>The Karate Kid?</i>

19:00.097 --> 19:03.386
Over there, the garden is
overgrown with strangler vines.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.559
Why do you think
we're avoiding that part?

19:05.645 --> 19:07.011
I have seen a vision.

19:07.104 --> 19:11.064
All vines trimmed
by your hand. Weeds, gone.

19:14.945 --> 19:18.109
- Where you going?
- I'm gonna go take care of a weed.

19:19.241 --> 19:20.982
It's an act, right?

19:21.077 --> 19:23.740
She's gotta be the one
that stole from the dragon.

19:23.829 --> 19:25.991
I don't know,
Q's acting like it's real.

19:26.082 --> 19:29.416
He's taking this whole
"father" thing pretty seriously.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.502
He's talking about what
kind of dad he wants to be.

19:31.587 --> 19:33.670
Look at her.

19:33.756 --> 19:35.088
She's sketchy on a good day.

19:36.759 --> 19:38.375
Definitely hiding something.

19:38.469 --> 19:41.633
I can feel it through
every mental ward.

19:41.722 --> 19:43.304
Bet she cast
some shit on him.

19:44.558 --> 19:45.765
Hmm?

19:45.893 --> 19:48.055
Dragon erotica?

19:48.145 --> 19:51.388
<i>"The Dragon Riders of Porn."</i>

19:51.482 --> 19:53.314
By Poppy Kline.

19:54.318 --> 19:57.527
Hmm, number-one bestseller
in its category.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.564
Oh, wow.

20:00.658 --> 20:01.819
It's detailed.

20:01.909 --> 20:03.775
The elixir?

20:06.956 --> 20:08.433
I thought Q said
he didn't find anything.

20:08.457 --> 20:10.198
Why is it empty?

20:17.174 --> 20:20.292
- It's not glowing, Alice.
- I can see that, Stephanie.

20:20.386 --> 20:21.752
Well, that's five tries.

20:21.846 --> 20:23.838
And I am not having
my magic suspended

20:23.931 --> 20:25.325
because of your
thumb-heavy casting.

20:25.349 --> 20:26.760
I'm not thumb-heavy!

20:26.851 --> 20:30.015
It's not your fault that you
inherited Daniel's fingers.

20:30.104 --> 20:31.766
The problem
is casting a spell

20:31.856 --> 20:33.472
that requires a connection
with a mother

20:33.566 --> 20:35.182
who refuses to
be called "Mom."

20:35.276 --> 20:37.689
Connections take
two people, Alice.

20:39.780 --> 20:40.816
I don't mean to be rude,

20:40.906 --> 20:42.738
but I did tell you
that I had previous plans.

20:42.825 --> 20:45.033
Now you act like I can
just drop everything

20:45.119 --> 20:46.985
for your
thick-fingered spells.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.320
The reason it's not working

20:48.414 --> 20:49.599
is because you would
rather go on a date

20:49.623 --> 20:50.830
than help your own daughter.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.123
It's not a date.

20:52.209 --> 20:53.450
It's Carol.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.794
The last time you saw her
you electrocuted her,

20:56.881 --> 20:59.168
so best not test her loyalty.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.875
The Library offers rewards
for fugitives.

21:01.969 --> 21:03.085
Out the back.

21:07.391 --> 21:09.223
I'm not leaving
without my spell.

21:11.479 --> 21:12.936
Nice illusion work, Carol.

21:13.022 --> 21:14.263
You look great.

21:14.899 --> 21:16.640
I mean, you always
look great, I just...

21:16.734 --> 21:18.976
I'm really sorry
about last time.

21:19.069 --> 21:20.589
Let's just leave it
in the past, shall we?

21:20.613 --> 21:21.694
For what it's worth,

21:21.781 --> 21:23.818
the Library doesn't like me
very much, either.

21:24.241 --> 21:25.241
Why is that?

21:25.326 --> 21:26.737
My new business.

21:34.752 --> 21:36.288
Marital aids.

21:36.378 --> 21:39.542
Your partner feels everything,
even long-distance.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.123
Especially long-distance.

21:41.717 --> 21:44.050
Oh, wow.

21:44.261 --> 21:45.797
Now, who is that?

21:46.764 --> 21:47.845
They work for the Library.

21:47.932 --> 21:49.468
Well, I'll just
send them away.

21:49.558 --> 21:50.952
What are they doing here
in the first place?

21:50.976 --> 21:52.092
I don't know what...

21:52.186 --> 21:54.143
You called them on me.

21:54.230 --> 21:55.596
I would never!

21:55.689 --> 21:57.351
Oh, would you just stop
for once, Mother?

22:05.825 --> 22:06.986
Bollocks.

22:07.076 --> 22:08.533
No, what did you do?

22:08.619 --> 22:10.299
My dad's <i>Purge</i> protocol.
I locked them out.

22:10.538 --> 22:12.495
And us in.

22:15.125 --> 22:18.038
Fen! Fen!

22:18.128 --> 22:20.666
Umber's Balls!
What did you do?

22:20.756 --> 22:23.544
I shoved this bullshit artist
right in the briar patch.

22:23.634 --> 22:26.217
Thought she'd see it coming.
Guess not.

22:26.303 --> 22:28.761
Margo, don't do this.
I'll never get my prophecy.

22:28.848 --> 22:30.680
Yes, free me or no prophecy!

22:30.766 --> 22:33.725
Oh, shut your lie-gina,
you cat-dressing con artist.

22:33.811 --> 22:35.052
How can I save you?

22:35.145 --> 22:39.014
I see some
shears in the shed.

22:39.108 --> 22:40.315
Oh.

22:40.401 --> 22:41.937
What?

22:42.027 --> 22:43.734
You didn't predict this?

22:43.821 --> 22:45.733
It's all a lie, Fen.

22:45.823 --> 22:48.941
She's been using us
to do her shit work.

22:50.995 --> 22:52.952
Oh, my gods.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.914
I deloused this wench's goat.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.868
Okay, I confess! I lied!

22:58.961 --> 23:01.624
No shit,
Benedict Cumber-douche.

23:01.714 --> 23:02.714
But why?

23:02.798 --> 23:05.415
Because you people
keep coming.

23:05.509 --> 23:07.876
Eating my food

23:07.970 --> 23:09.506
and ruining my yard.

23:09.597 --> 23:10.838
We do?

23:10.931 --> 23:13.093
In dreams, she appears
near here,

23:13.183 --> 23:14.549
so you all come to find her.

23:14.643 --> 23:16.555
And then you force them
to work for you.

23:16.645 --> 23:18.853
I only wanted to repair
what was destroyed

23:18.939 --> 23:19.975
by pilgrims like you.

23:20.065 --> 23:23.479
So the real Green Hood,
what's her deal?

23:23.944 --> 23:25.025
A Questing Creature.

23:25.988 --> 23:28.196
She can only be caught
in dreams. It's tricky.

23:28.782 --> 23:30.614
She is called The Napster.

23:30.701 --> 23:31.701
"Napster"?

23:31.785 --> 23:32.905
Like the music-sharing site?

23:33.954 --> 23:35.695
I met Sean Parker
at an Arby's.

23:36.540 --> 23:39.908
I seriously underestimate you
sometimes, you know that?

23:40.002 --> 23:41.664
Yeah, no, I know that.

23:41.754 --> 23:42.995
Well, not anymore.

23:43.088 --> 23:45.205
I hate Fillory for
making me say this,

23:45.299 --> 23:47.382
but we have to shut down
The Napster.

23:57.144 --> 23:58.305
Hey, what
are you doing?

23:59.813 --> 24:02.681
Oh, Poppy wanted to feel
like she was on a beach,

24:02.775 --> 24:05.688
so I'm just helping her out.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.442
Definitely acting normal.

24:15.746 --> 24:17.328
Holy shit.

24:18.666 --> 24:20.157
Guys, I think I've got it.

24:21.835 --> 24:24.168
Yeah, I mean, that's
one way of putting it

24:24.254 --> 24:25.540
the way the lava's erupting.

24:25.631 --> 24:26.963
Don't you get it?

24:27.549 --> 24:28.915
It's the elixir.

24:31.595 --> 24:32.961
- Oh, God.
- Ah!

24:34.473 --> 24:36.135
The elixir is dragon spooge.

24:36.225 --> 24:38.262
Why? Why would
she steal that?

24:38.852 --> 24:40.844
Holy fuck.

24:41.271 --> 24:43.433
So, remember how we said
Quentin was the father?

24:44.274 --> 24:45.310
We lied.

24:45.609 --> 24:47.100
So you're saying you...

24:47.194 --> 24:49.402
Turkey-bastered myself
with dragon semen. No big.

24:49.488 --> 24:52.606
I have a few
thousand questions.

24:52.700 --> 24:55.067
Think of dragons
as universal sperm donors.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.368
Makes for some
really cool hybrids.

24:57.454 --> 24:58.990
My kid's gonna be epic.

24:59.081 --> 25:01.323
It sounds kind of dangerous.

25:01.709 --> 25:03.450
Do you have any idea
how big it's gonna...

25:03.877 --> 25:05.118
Oh, nope.
This is a first.

25:05.462 --> 25:06.498
Historic.

25:06.922 --> 25:08.788
I suggest you
back the fuck up.

25:09.466 --> 25:10.673
No one is taking my baby.

25:11.760 --> 25:14.844
Said the world's first
true mama of dragons.

25:14.930 --> 25:17.250
Look, Poppy, I don't know you,
but you're acting kind of...

25:17.975 --> 25:20.262
Just trust me when I say
magical pregnancies

25:20.352 --> 25:21.352
can mess with your head.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.471
Especially the people
around you.

25:27.526 --> 25:28.892
Oh, crap.

25:30.738 --> 25:33.856
You know what, hold that
thought... Two seconds.

25:33.949 --> 25:35.281
Guys, sidebar?

25:39.455 --> 25:40.455
Dragon fetus.

25:41.248 --> 25:42.910
That's why Q's acting crazy.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.333
Must have some sort
of built-in protection.

25:45.419 --> 25:46.419
It's touch.

25:52.426 --> 25:54.839
So that's dragon
pregnancy porn?

25:54.928 --> 25:56.510
Don't kink-shame.

25:56.597 --> 25:57.929
No, it says here

25:58.015 --> 26:00.223
that dragon babies
have a pheromone.

26:00.309 --> 26:03.473
Anything touches them,
it takes over.

26:03.562 --> 26:06.305
Forces them to nurture
so the baby's safe.

26:06.398 --> 26:10.267
So Q touched Poppy's belly,
and now they're nesting.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.067
The hell are we gonna do?

26:14.364 --> 26:15.605
Traveller-proof wards.

26:15.908 --> 26:16.944
Balls.

26:17.034 --> 26:18.866
I'm supposed
to be on easy duty.

26:18.952 --> 26:20.318
"Tag 'em and bag 'em,"

26:20.412 --> 26:23.155
not "manage a hostage
situation," for shit's sake.

26:23.290 --> 26:25.828
- We know it's a hostage situation?
- Don't be daft.

26:25.918 --> 26:27.437
When people turn in
friends and family,

26:27.461 --> 26:28.980
sometimes they take it
a touch personal.

26:29.004 --> 26:30.690
You think she realized
that Stephanie called us?

26:30.714 --> 26:33.172
Muhammed, I have no idea.

26:33.258 --> 26:34.920
I also don't really
give a fuck.

26:35.010 --> 26:38.174
I do. Protocol dictates
that we break in there.

26:39.264 --> 26:41.130
Arrest the fugitive
before anything happens.

26:41.225 --> 26:43.467
Let me know
when you get through the wards.

26:43.852 --> 26:45.764
I'll just be over here,
planking.

26:47.773 --> 26:50.356
We can deploy the screamers.

26:53.529 --> 26:54.736
You're doing the paperwork.

26:55.322 --> 26:59.566
Alice, I don't know
why they're here, okay?

26:59.660 --> 27:02.994
It's probably just
a friendly, routine visit.

27:03.080 --> 27:04.080
Just admit it, Stephanie.

27:04.164 --> 27:05.517
You blame me
for all your problems.

27:05.541 --> 27:07.861
- That is not true.
- You barely think of me as a daughter.

27:07.918 --> 27:09.159
The second you had a chance

27:09.253 --> 27:11.022
to turn me in for
your own benefit, you took it.

27:11.046 --> 27:12.753
No, I didn't!

27:13.465 --> 27:14.922
I turned in Carol.

27:16.093 --> 27:17.093
What?

27:18.554 --> 27:20.011
Hi, Carol.

27:26.228 --> 27:28.766
We came for the elixir.
The elixir's definitely gone.

27:28.856 --> 27:30.893
We're not getting it back,
so now what?

27:30.983 --> 27:32.224
I don't know.

27:32.317 --> 27:34.517
I guess we gotta find
something else to give the dragon.

27:36.780 --> 27:39.614
It says here that dragon eggs
take three years to gestate.

27:39.867 --> 27:41.859
So this is informative

27:41.952 --> 27:44.069
dragon pregnancy porn.

27:44.163 --> 27:46.576
Poppy stole the elixir
last week.

27:46.665 --> 27:48.497
Would she be
this pregnant already?

27:48.584 --> 27:49.825
You think she's lying.

27:49.918 --> 27:51.079
Well, it's Poppy.

27:51.712 --> 27:53.453
I mean, what sounds real?

27:53.547 --> 27:56.756
A reptile-redhead
hybrid or a lying thief

27:56.842 --> 27:58.762
stashing actual fertilized
dragon eggs somewhere?

27:59.469 --> 28:00.630
I'll beat it out of them.

28:01.471 --> 28:02.928
So you're...

28:03.015 --> 28:05.428
- Normal human pregnant.
- Seriously?

28:05.893 --> 28:07.634
How do we ever
believe anything you say?

28:07.728 --> 28:08.728
It's called a misdirect.

28:08.812 --> 28:10.348
Yeah, so that
you didn't find Falcor.

28:10.439 --> 28:11.771
We're not calling it "Falcor."

28:11.857 --> 28:12.917
Would you please
let me have...

28:12.941 --> 28:14.043
Okay, well,
how is it even possible

28:14.067 --> 28:16.150
you used the elixir
to fertilize that?

28:16.778 --> 28:18.235
Dragons are just fancy fish.

28:18.322 --> 28:20.029
Spray a load on the egg,
and <i>voilÃ .</i>

28:20.324 --> 28:22.111
Okay, you two have got
the pheromone crazies.

28:22.201 --> 28:25.660
You've touched the egg,
and now it's making you do stupid things.

28:26.496 --> 28:28.704
You let go of Falcor!

28:28.790 --> 28:31.030
I will murder you if you hurt my baby.
Do you understand?

28:31.585 --> 28:32.585
Uh, guys?

28:33.629 --> 28:34.836
Why do I want
to lick this egg?

28:34.922 --> 28:36.129
I want to lick this egg.

28:36.256 --> 28:38.714
Oh, that goes away
in a few minutes.

28:39.885 --> 28:41.217
Oh, boy.

28:41.303 --> 28:42.655
Egg beats
oven mitts, bitch.

28:42.679 --> 28:44.011
Now you're my sister-wife.

28:44.181 --> 28:45.617
Julia, you want to get
a lick off this egg?

28:45.641 --> 28:46.757
Ooh, four parents?

28:46.850 --> 28:48.077
I mean, I guess
it worked on <i>Big Love.</i>

28:48.101 --> 28:49.308
Julia, do not lick that egg!

28:49.394 --> 28:50.394
Don't...

28:52.856 --> 28:55.974
The funny thing is,
magic doesn't work on me

28:56.068 --> 28:57.184
the way it does on you!

28:58.111 --> 29:00.945
Travel or follow us and it's
eggs over easy, you hear me?

29:03.784 --> 29:05.821
It's Sam's gun. The cop.
I kept it.

29:05.911 --> 29:07.402
Smart.

29:07.496 --> 29:09.362
- No.
- Back off.

29:11.416 --> 29:12.452
Falcor.

29:26.682 --> 29:28.322
The Library won't stop
at screaming books.

29:28.350 --> 29:29.716
We have to find a way
out of here.

29:29.810 --> 29:34.271
Or Carol could do the right
thing and turn herself in.

29:34.356 --> 29:36.769
All I'm doing is selling
intimacy aids.

29:36.858 --> 29:37.858
Oh, please.

29:37.943 --> 29:41.607
Half your customers use them
to punish their enemies.

29:41.863 --> 29:45.982
Carol, voodoo dolls for fucking are
still fucking voodoo dolls.

29:46.410 --> 29:47.410
They are.

29:48.245 --> 29:50.005
Could we use those
on the Librarians outside?

29:50.038 --> 29:51.370
They require DNA.

29:52.791 --> 29:53.827
Oh, I have that.

29:54.835 --> 29:57.373
Oh, Jesus Christ,
Miss Judgey.

29:57.462 --> 29:58.462
I didn't.

29:59.673 --> 30:00.754
Not that I wouldn't,

30:00.841 --> 30:03.003
but they were
here this morning,

30:03.093 --> 30:05.050
and their mugs
are in the sink.

30:07.556 --> 30:09.172
And maybe next time,

30:09.558 --> 30:10.844
you will listen to me.

30:11.351 --> 30:14.719
I have been trying
to get rid of you all day long.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.679
The least you could do
is acknowledge

30:16.773 --> 30:18.480
that I didn't turn you in.

30:18.984 --> 30:20.691
You turned in
your best friend.

30:20.986 --> 30:23.273
That spell just proves
that we are strangers.

30:23.363 --> 30:25.400
And I am fine with it,
because I wouldn't want

30:25.490 --> 30:27.330
to be related to somebody
who did what you did.

30:27.451 --> 30:28.862
You...

30:32.664 --> 30:35.122
Alice, you do not
make this easy.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.376
I know what you're capable of.

30:40.213 --> 30:41.545
Good and bad.

30:44.259 --> 30:46.091
But there is nothing
that you could say,

30:46.636 --> 30:48.502
there is nothing
that you could do,

30:49.264 --> 30:52.632
that would make me
turn you in.

30:56.772 --> 30:58.638
You are all I have.

31:06.990 --> 31:09.232
Could we try the mother-daughter
spell one more time?

31:16.875 --> 31:18.616
Why did it work this time?

31:23.965 --> 31:25.831
You and I never
liked each other,

31:26.635 --> 31:28.613
and when Dad died, I thought
that we'd finally be done

31:28.637 --> 31:31.050
and you'd wash your hands
as a mother, but you didn't.

31:33.350 --> 31:35.057
You still protect me.

31:35.602 --> 31:37.389
In your own way.

31:38.063 --> 31:42.478
Which means I was the one
choosing to not be your daughter.

31:45.946 --> 31:47.687
Oh, honey...

31:51.243 --> 31:52.950
So, it was your fault?

32:01.586 --> 32:03.202
Are you bitches ready
for a puppet show?

32:06.383 --> 32:07.383
Oh.

32:09.094 --> 32:10.094
Mmm.

32:14.307 --> 32:15.307
Are you okay?

32:15.809 --> 32:16.809
Uh-huh.

32:16.893 --> 32:19.180
Oh, my God.

32:23.650 --> 32:24.650
Do that one again.

32:51.803 --> 32:54.341
It's over, Jules.
Give us the egg.

32:54.431 --> 32:56.798
What part of "I have a gun"
did you forget about?

32:57.893 --> 32:59.930
Back off,
or your baby gets it.

33:00.520 --> 33:01.761
Fine.

33:01.855 --> 33:03.615
You gonna hold your arms
out there all night?

33:10.197 --> 33:11.733
Holy fuck.

33:11.823 --> 33:12.823
Oh, shit.

33:15.452 --> 33:17.614
Why the hell
is everybody yelling?

33:18.788 --> 33:20.950
I sent them
to find your elixir.

33:21.041 --> 33:23.283
It is here, O Ancient One.
In this egg.

33:23.752 --> 33:25.709
It's, um, kind of fertilized.

33:25.795 --> 33:26.876
What?

33:26.963 --> 33:30.047
I'm only 12,422.

33:30.133 --> 33:31.999
Too young to be a mother.

33:33.261 --> 33:35.844
Wait, how can you
hold it like that?

33:37.182 --> 33:38.218
Um...

33:38.308 --> 33:40.095
- Here, if you'd just take it...
- It's mine!

33:40.185 --> 33:42.142
I won it off
the Seine River Dragon.

33:42.229 --> 33:45.518
This is Amelie's egg?

33:45.607 --> 33:47.439
Is that good?

33:48.318 --> 33:50.059
Well, not for Amelie.

33:50.278 --> 33:52.190
In the basket.

33:53.323 --> 33:54.985
No, no, please!

33:55.116 --> 33:56.636
- I need it! Please!
- Julia, come on. Let's talk about this.

33:56.660 --> 33:58.513
It's not too late
to do the right thing, Julia.

33:58.537 --> 34:01.075
No, no...

34:01.164 --> 34:02.621
- My baby.
- No, no, no.

34:02.707 --> 34:04.323
- No, my...
- No, no, no.

34:04.417 --> 34:07.034
- Falcor...
- My baby.

34:07.128 --> 34:08.869
Falcor!

34:13.134 --> 34:14.250
Baby...

34:23.436 --> 34:25.768
Thank you, Alice. Truly.

34:26.982 --> 34:28.688
I've arranged for
the increase in rations.

34:29.234 --> 34:30.440
Thank you, as well.

34:30.860 --> 34:33.147
Well, for once,

34:33.237 --> 34:36.322
everyone in this room
has done something good.

34:36.408 --> 34:39.242
Let's enjoy it
for the five seconds it lasts.

34:45.458 --> 34:46.574
Of course.

34:46.668 --> 34:47.875
Sheila.

34:47.960 --> 34:50.043
And, five seconds over.

34:55.427 --> 34:57.589
Alice.
It's good to see you.

34:59.681 --> 35:01.138
Why are you wearing that?

35:01.224 --> 35:04.513
Well, it's because
I joined The Order.

35:05.520 --> 35:06.852
And on that note...

35:07.564 --> 35:11.524
- What the fuck did you do to her?
- Nothing, I promise.

35:11.610 --> 35:13.727
- They forced you.
- Alice, please just sit down.

35:13.820 --> 35:16.858
- No!
- It's everything I ever wanted.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.843
- Do you know what they do?
- No, nothing's perfect.

35:18.867 --> 35:20.904
- People have died!
- Alice,

35:22.412 --> 35:25.405
what you did for me,
I will always owe you.

35:25.498 --> 35:28.741
But now you should see
what I'm working on.

35:29.294 --> 35:31.001
Alice, I'm helping people.

35:32.380 --> 35:33.541
It's good.

35:33.632 --> 35:35.919
And now you're safe,
too, Alice.

35:36.009 --> 35:37.090
As a Junior Librarian,

35:37.177 --> 35:39.134
Sheila's book has been placed
in the Poison Room,

35:39.220 --> 35:43.214
where any inconsistencies
with your book will remain undetected.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.635
The beacon, please.

35:48.229 --> 35:50.186
Shiela,
they're not good, okay?

35:50.273 --> 35:52.060
They're compromised.
They are the enemy.

35:52.150 --> 35:55.314
Everyone in this room
is your ally.

35:56.112 --> 35:57.112
No.

35:57.322 --> 35:59.029
You have to let me go, hon.

36:21.638 --> 36:23.254
How are you?

36:23.348 --> 36:26.887
Well, I didn't get
egg fever, so...

36:28.353 --> 36:29.685
I mean, about that.

36:30.355 --> 36:33.519
The not knowing
what your deal really is.

36:35.568 --> 36:37.400
Well, whatever it is,
it's useful, right?

36:38.113 --> 36:39.113
I didn't ask that.

36:39.906 --> 36:40.906
I don't know.

36:43.952 --> 36:44.952
Q and I, we...

36:46.830 --> 36:48.662
Used to be the same.

36:48.748 --> 36:51.240
I mean, we were
the same thing.

36:51.334 --> 36:53.917
- Magicians?
- Human.

36:54.754 --> 36:57.667
And now I'm... I don't
know what I am.

36:57.757 --> 37:00.500
Unless a god walks in,
I'm gonna outlive everyone.

37:00.593 --> 37:02.801
Hard to describe
what that feels like.

37:03.847 --> 37:04.847
Except alone.

37:07.225 --> 37:08.591
Funny thing about Travellers,

37:08.685 --> 37:10.893
we're not exactly
human either.

37:12.355 --> 37:14.893
You're alone, and you're not.

37:17.736 --> 37:18.736
Oh...

37:18.820 --> 37:20.277
Jesus.

37:20.363 --> 37:24.448
Oh, please tell me that Coldwater's egg
hangover is worse than mine.

37:29.330 --> 37:30.330
It's just...

37:31.708 --> 37:33.870
I never even thought
about being a mom, you know?

37:33.960 --> 37:35.826
And then I found out and...

37:35.920 --> 37:37.627
You realized you wanted to.

37:37.714 --> 37:39.330
Oh, God, no.

37:39.424 --> 37:41.882
I was like,
"Hi, field researcher.

37:41.968 --> 37:45.052
"I let poison things
bite me for fun. No baby."

37:45.138 --> 37:48.631
But I got invited to see a
Haitian Spiketoe mating ritual,

37:48.725 --> 37:52.059
and I sort of forgot to,
you know...

37:52.604 --> 37:54.971
Fuck euphemisms, abort it.

37:56.024 --> 37:57.024
Oh.

37:59.027 --> 38:01.269
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Thank you.

38:01.905 --> 38:04.022
So I was like, "Okay,
give it to a nice couple."

38:04.115 --> 38:06.607
Fine. But I am not letting it
cramp my style.

38:06.701 --> 38:09.444
And then the egg,
and the chance to fertilize it,

38:09.537 --> 38:12.450
unprecedented, and...

38:12.540 --> 38:17.001
I basically begged the East River Dragon
to revenge-eat me.

38:17.086 --> 38:20.079
I mean, zero
mothering instincts.

38:21.299 --> 38:22.540
Well, maybe it's a...

38:23.885 --> 38:25.877
Good thing that you're...

38:25.970 --> 38:28.678
- You know, giving it to...
- No, no, that's the thing.

38:28.765 --> 38:30.381
I thought I had zero.

38:30.475 --> 38:32.512
But then I touched
that egg and...

38:34.062 --> 38:35.062
I get it now.

38:36.606 --> 38:38.188
And now I feel it
for this, too.

38:39.859 --> 38:41.145
Oh, wow.

38:44.113 --> 38:45.820
- Are you sure?
- I mean,

38:46.866 --> 38:48.949
unconventional parents
can be awesome, right?

38:49.035 --> 38:50.035
Or shitty.

38:50.620 --> 38:52.703
Think about
the weird places it'll...

38:52.789 --> 38:55.577
And the germs it'll
be exposed to.

38:55.667 --> 38:57.624
Its immune system
will be amazing.

38:57.710 --> 39:00.748
And if Mom's
a selfish brat, well...

39:00.839 --> 39:03.502
It's not like good parenting
makes great artists, right?

39:03.591 --> 39:07.335
I, um, think that
you should sleep this off

39:07.428 --> 39:08.964
for just a
couple of days. Here.

39:09.055 --> 39:10.671
No, you convinced me.

39:10.765 --> 39:13.428
- Wait, I...
- I'm gonna crush this.

39:13.518 --> 39:15.009
Me and Dakota.

39:16.479 --> 39:17.479
Draco.

39:18.815 --> 39:19.815
Misti?

39:22.068 --> 39:23.068
Thank you, Quentin.

39:25.071 --> 39:26.607
Yeah, anytime. Yeah...

39:31.327 --> 39:32.408
Is it mine?

39:34.372 --> 39:35.372
No.

39:36.833 --> 39:38.244
Why? Did you want it to be?

39:42.881 --> 39:44.372
You think you'll
ever be a dad?

39:46.593 --> 39:47.593
I hope so.

39:48.595 --> 39:51.008
Cool, 'cause I'm making you
the godfather.

39:51.973 --> 39:53.089
- Wait, what?
- Okay.

39:53.182 --> 39:57.142
I can't drink, so I need to go
make a 6,000 egg omelet immediately.

39:57.604 --> 39:58.845
Oh.

40:11.659 --> 40:13.651
At the behest of my mistress.

40:15.246 --> 40:17.989
Thank you. Tell her
we all said so.

40:18.082 --> 40:20.950
I also have a message
for the former goddess.

40:21.044 --> 40:24.333
My mistress wishes you good fortune
in recovering your truth.

40:24.422 --> 40:27.881
She advises you not to accept
your current circumstance.

40:27.967 --> 40:30.880
It would be best for you
and all of our kind

40:30.970 --> 40:34.213
that you make this state
you find yourself in

40:34.307 --> 40:35.388
temporary.

40:36.976 --> 40:40.686
Okay. Your mistress have
any advice on how I do that?

40:40.772 --> 40:42.980
You must seek The Binder.

40:44.108 --> 40:48.068
She then went on to explain
what that means in elaborate detail?

41:00.750 --> 41:02.061
We're gonna
nab this cat bitch

41:02.085 --> 41:03.951
- and get you that prophecy.
- Thanks, Margo.

41:04.045 --> 41:06.002
And then I'm gonna
slather myself in butter,

41:06.089 --> 41:09.332
throw myself at Josh's feet
and beg for forgiveness.

41:09.842 --> 41:12.004
Um, I mean, I guess
that's one way of apologizing.

41:12.095 --> 41:13.836
I'm gonna marry that man, Fen.

41:14.389 --> 41:16.051
And I want you
to give me away.

41:16.891 --> 41:18.382
Oh.

41:18.476 --> 41:19.842
But you and I
aren't really...

41:21.020 --> 41:22.761
Oh, this is a dream.

41:26.150 --> 41:27.150
Hey!

41:28.611 --> 41:29.611
Oops!

41:29.737 --> 41:31.194
Guess I run fast in dreams.

41:32.991 --> 41:34.698
Finally caught you, Napster.

41:38.621 --> 41:40.221
Oh, wow, you're beautiful...

41:41.916 --> 41:44.203
- Scary.
- Why aren't you waking up?

41:44.293 --> 41:46.876
Little trick from
my friend Margo.

41:46.963 --> 41:49.455
Potion called Ambien.

41:49.549 --> 41:51.381
I may never wake up.

41:52.093 --> 41:54.426
You found a way so quickly.

41:54.512 --> 41:55.923
This bodes well
for your future.

42:01.144 --> 42:02.144
I'm ready.

42:03.730 --> 42:05.062
Tell me.

42:05.148 --> 42:07.231
Oh.

42:08.526 --> 42:09.562
You're not gonna like it.

42:10.778 --> 42:12.440
Like what?

42:12.530 --> 42:14.066
Your destiny.

42:14.157 --> 42:16.114
Very hard to change.

42:16.200 --> 42:18.692
Last chance to ask me
for someone else's instead.

42:18.786 --> 42:20.652
"Someone else's"?

42:22.081 --> 42:24.539
- I can do that?
- Of course.

42:25.168 --> 42:26.168
What'll it be?

42:26.753 --> 42:27.789
I'm...

42:30.465 --> 42:32.047
Margo might need this
more than I do.

42:33.217 --> 42:34.583
She rules Fillory, so...

42:34.969 --> 42:35.969
Ah, yes.

42:36.929 --> 42:39.012
The girl raised
to marry the king.

42:39.098 --> 42:41.715
Of course you're more worried
about her than yourself.

42:41.809 --> 42:42.849
Let me ask you a question.

42:43.853 --> 42:45.139
Do you value yourself, Fen?

42:45.646 --> 42:46.762
Of course I do.

42:46.856 --> 42:49.519
I... Think I do.

42:50.943 --> 42:51.943
I'm not sure.

42:54.447 --> 42:56.564
I need to, don't I?

42:56.991 --> 42:58.778
What good am I to Fillory
if I don't?

43:01.454 --> 43:02.454
Okay.

43:04.832 --> 43:07.370
I want mine.

43:07.460 --> 43:08.621
Tell me my destiny.

43:11.923 --> 43:12.923
Your destiny

43:15.468 --> 43:17.630
concerns High King Margo.

43:17.720 --> 43:19.803
Seriously? After all that?

43:19.889 --> 43:23.053
A moment will come to protect
the future of Fillory.

43:23.142 --> 43:24.929
A moment to stand
beside the High King

43:25.353 --> 43:27.595
before all the leaders
of your world...

43:27.688 --> 43:30.431
- I can do that.
- And then dethrone her.

43:31.818 --> 43:34.185
- Excuse me?
- Violently, if necessary.

43:34.278 --> 43:35.564
Take her crown, Fen.

43:36.280 --> 43:40.115
Even if that means
drenching it in her blood.
