00:04.600 --> 00:06.160
How long's it been
going on, Ngaire?

00:06.280 --> 00:07.480
How long has
what been going on?

00:07.600 --> 00:08.960
Jesus!

00:09.080 --> 00:11.080
You are gonna come andwork for me at the Galleria.

00:11.200 --> 00:13.720
All my bits and pieces
are fully operational.

00:13.840 --> 00:14.680
That's what they said.

00:14.800 --> 00:16.280
He's shooting blanks.

00:16.400 --> 00:17.960
I didn't think you couldtake money out of South Africa.

00:18.080 --> 00:19.080
Well, you can't.

00:19.200 --> 00:21.120
Unless you have
a very big yacht.

00:21.240 --> 00:23.560
There are cars on a
ship somewhere up north.

00:23.680 --> 00:25.480
It has to be crystal clearto Lace that you had nothing

00:25.600 --> 00:26.880
to do with it.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.320
Well, he's gonna suspectme, whatever we do.

00:28.440 --> 00:30.440
But there are others muchcloser to home than you

00:30.560 --> 00:31.880
that he's gonna suspect first.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.120
Dad in on this?

00:33.240 --> 00:35.640
No.

00:35.760 --> 00:38.120
[music playing]

00:45.720 --> 00:46.680
Oh, I thought I was late.

00:46.800 --> 00:47.560
You are.

00:52.200 --> 00:53.640
Sorry.

00:53.760 --> 00:55.440
Visiting my great auntie.

00:55.560 --> 00:57.640
Come on, hit me harder!

00:57.760 --> 00:59.200
Hit me!

00:59.320 --> 01:01.000
Great auntie's the sisterof one of your grandparents,

01:01.120 --> 01:02.360
right?

01:02.480 --> 01:04.600
Hey, Phin.

01:04.720 --> 01:05.680
About time.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.200
Oh, sorry, Ted.

01:07.320 --> 01:08.880
Has the boat come in?

01:09.000 --> 01:10.480
Or are we here so you can tellus we have to sit on our asses

01:10.600 --> 01:11.440
for another week?

01:11.560 --> 01:12.760
On the bones of our asses.

01:12.880 --> 01:14.320
What's your problem?

01:14.440 --> 01:16.320
I thought Ngaire wasbringing home the bacon now.

01:16.440 --> 01:17.560
Exactly.

01:17.680 --> 01:19.280
My wife's slaving
away for your wife,

01:19.400 --> 01:21.080
when she should be at home,looking after the kids

01:21.200 --> 01:22.600
and cooking the dinner.
- Bastard!

01:22.720 --> 01:24.040
Maybe we should
get Kentucky Fried.

01:24.160 --> 01:25.560
Or wait for Mum to come home.

01:25.680 --> 01:27.520
I don't bloody know
when she's coming home!

01:27.640 --> 01:29.120
You should be doing this!

01:29.240 --> 01:30.320
How you gonna cook for yourhusband if you don't learn?

01:30.440 --> 01:32.160
I'm not gonna cook for anyone.

01:32.280 --> 01:34.760
I'm going to work, like Mum.

01:34.880 --> 01:36.560
Oh, geez, what a tragedy.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.000
As for you, you
should be all right

01:38.120 --> 01:39.320
with your wife's flash job.

01:43.640 --> 01:48.880
Carol, got five
bucks for petrol?

01:49.000 --> 01:51.280
A woman's place is in the home,instead of out there taking

01:51.400 --> 01:52.880
jobs from men.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.840
Phineas, didn't realize youwanted to be trolley-dolly.

01:54.960 --> 01:56.040
Did you ask Des?

01:56.160 --> 01:58.080
He doesn't know
anything about a yacht.

01:58.200 --> 02:00.160
I thought you said the moneywas coming in on a yacht.

02:00.280 --> 02:01.240
It is, OK?

02:01.360 --> 02:02.680
It will be here.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.680
Second day is tomorrow.

02:04.800 --> 02:06.080
Only two weeks after that.

02:06.200 --> 02:07.400
It will be here.

02:07.520 --> 02:08.680
Meanwhile, we're on
the bones of our asses.

02:08.800 --> 02:10.240
What about the money
that Carol earns?

02:10.360 --> 02:12.600
I'm talking about actualmoney actually earned by me.

02:12.720 --> 02:15.000
We should do a quickcash job, to tide us over.

02:15.120 --> 02:16.680
Why?

02:16.800 --> 02:19.160
Why risk it, when, literally,our boat is about to come in?

02:19.280 --> 02:20.080
Cash, Ted.

02:20.200 --> 02:21.200
Actual cash money.

02:21.320 --> 02:23.280
What are you thinking?

02:23.400 --> 02:24.480
The RSA on Wilston Road.

02:24.600 --> 02:25.800
- No.
- Why not?

02:25.920 --> 02:27.120
It's an easy target.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.200
It's old people who
fought for our country.

02:29.320 --> 02:30.800
I'm not talking about
robbing them personally.

02:30.920 --> 02:32.840
Just the bar.

02:32.960 --> 02:34.560
And those old
guys do drink a lot.

02:34.680 --> 02:36.160
No, we wait.

02:36.280 --> 02:37.400
And starve in the meantime?

02:37.520 --> 02:40.040
No one is fucking
starving, OK?

02:40.160 --> 02:41.600
Our wives are all earning money.

02:41.720 --> 02:43.960
And you might be OK withit, but some of us aren't.

02:44.080 --> 02:46.080
And how come you get tobe the one who says no, huh?

02:46.200 --> 02:48.040
Because I'm supposed
to be the leader here.

02:48.160 --> 02:52.240
Or we could trydemocracy, put it to a vote.

02:52.360 --> 02:55.240
All who wanna do the RSA
job, raise your hand.

03:03.280 --> 03:05.480
No, it'll be bad
karma, I reckon.

03:05.600 --> 03:07.920
Seems unpatriotic,
so it's a no from me.

03:08.040 --> 03:09.240
Three against two.

03:09.360 --> 03:12.480
End of discussion.

03:12.600 --> 03:13.440
THEME SONG: Watch your back.

03:13.560 --> 03:14.600
Watch your back.

03:14.720 --> 03:18.040
When you're walking
down the alleys.

03:18.160 --> 03:18.920
Watch your back.

03:19.040 --> 03:20.400
Watch your back.

03:20.520 --> 03:23.400
When you're out on the street.

03:23.520 --> 03:26.400
And there's a strangeron the street these days.

03:26.520 --> 03:28.400
You can't see it through
your fog and haze.

03:28.520 --> 03:31.400
Well, everybody's going crazy.

03:31.520 --> 03:33.400
Everybody's going crazy.

03:33.520 --> 03:34.760
Everybody's going crazy.

03:41.120 --> 03:43.560
He can't know I'mgetting his stuff tested.

03:43.680 --> 03:45.120
Is that possible?

03:45.240 --> 03:46.800
I just need to collect asample without him knowing,

03:46.920 --> 03:49.080
and then take that to be tested.

03:49.200 --> 03:50.040
Without him knowing?

03:50.160 --> 03:50.920
How?

03:51.040 --> 03:53.080
I can think of a way.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.080
Ugh.

03:54.200 --> 03:56.000
Eric, you need to leave.

03:56.120 --> 03:57.200
Fella's suggestion.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.360
Phineas doesn't
believe in, you know.

03:59.480 --> 04:02.040
He says it's an abominationin the face of the Lord.

04:02.160 --> 04:04.120
Oh, if only Lefty
were religious.

04:04.240 --> 04:06.600
So he does not
believe in, you know?

04:06.720 --> 04:07.600
Does that go both ways?

04:07.720 --> 04:09.360
Eric, get out.

04:09.480 --> 04:10.600
Sorry.

04:10.720 --> 04:11.600
I have to go.

04:11.720 --> 04:13.040
I have to get everything ready.

04:13.160 --> 04:14.600
What everything?

04:14.720 --> 04:15.960
The grog, the thermos.

04:16.080 --> 04:17.800
Why do you need a
thermos for the grog?

04:17.920 --> 04:19.840
The thermos
isn't for the grog.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.600
Oh, dear Lord.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.040
So you're gonna get him drunk.

04:23.160 --> 04:24.600
As in passed out wasted.

04:24.720 --> 04:26.960
And then just help yourself?

04:27.080 --> 04:27.920
Yes.

04:28.040 --> 04:29.200
What about brewer's droop?

04:29.320 --> 04:30.520
Never a problem for Phin.

04:30.640 --> 04:33.120
He can get it up day or
night, asleep or awake.

04:33.240 --> 04:35.160
And if he's had a big night,he sleeps like the dead.

04:35.280 --> 04:39.440
Carol, this plan
sounds extremely stupid.

04:39.560 --> 04:40.680
I don't know, Rita.

04:40.800 --> 04:43.480
Seems to me she's
got a handle on it.

04:43.600 --> 04:46.440
You may laugh, but it's
the only plan I've got.

04:49.200 --> 04:50.800
Good luck, then.

04:50.920 --> 04:52.560
Poor thing.

04:52.680 --> 04:55.120
Lefty only had to lookat me and I got pregnant.

04:55.240 --> 04:57.120
You'd better be
careful then, Ngaire.

04:57.240 --> 04:59.120
Wouldn't want a little
piglet in the family.

04:59.240 --> 05:01.520
You don't have to
worry about that.

05:01.640 --> 05:02.680
I'm careful.

05:02.800 --> 05:03.840
Good to know.

05:03.960 --> 05:05.200
NGAIRE: Your
accounts are a mess.

05:05.320 --> 05:06.520
Yeah, well, your
life's a mess.

05:11.600 --> 05:14.760
I was thinking maybe
I should get a job.

05:14.880 --> 05:15.920
Fuck that.

05:16.040 --> 05:18.080
I can't keep asking
Carol for money.

05:18.200 --> 05:19.440
It's like--

05:19.560 --> 05:20.320
It's bullshit.

05:20.440 --> 05:21.240
That's what it is.

05:23.880 --> 05:25.560
We should do the RSA job.

05:25.680 --> 05:26.760
But we lost the vote.

05:26.880 --> 05:28.440
Wait a minute.

05:28.560 --> 05:30.760
Those other nancies said
they didn't want in.

05:30.880 --> 05:35.080
All that means is
more for you and me.

05:35.200 --> 05:36.480
You mean the two
of us do the job?

05:36.600 --> 05:37.360
We could do it tonight.

05:37.480 --> 05:40.360
Why the fuck not?

05:40.480 --> 05:43.080
You and me, and Ted, andBert, and Bilkey, we're a team.

05:43.200 --> 05:44.280
We'll call it a one-off.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.080
Just get some cash
to see us through.

05:46.200 --> 05:47.680
I don't know about
you, but I need to get

05:47.800 --> 05:49.320
my balls back, all right?

05:49.440 --> 05:51.200
Ball.

05:51.320 --> 05:52.760
I'm fucking doing this.

05:52.880 --> 05:54.080
You're either with
me or you're not.

05:59.240 --> 06:00.200
Good day at work?

06:00.320 --> 06:01.120
Shit, yeah.

06:07.480 --> 06:09.120
You like?

06:09.240 --> 06:10.560
Of course.
Is it new?

06:10.680 --> 06:11.480
Yeah.

06:11.600 --> 06:13.440
Wanna go for a ride?

06:13.560 --> 06:14.320
Sure.

06:22.880 --> 06:24.280
That Indian family
who are about to sign

06:24.400 --> 06:25.720
on off on a lease
on the warehouse,

06:25.840 --> 06:27.720
they changed their minds.

06:27.840 --> 06:29.120
Did they just?

06:29.240 --> 06:31.880
Turns out the placewas a magnet for vandals.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.120
[INDIAN ACCENT]
Well, what a shame.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.600
Tough day at work, drivingaround in a flashy car?

06:40.720 --> 06:42.440
It's more where we wereheaded to that matters, Eric.

06:47.200 --> 06:48.960
We're not gonna
be long, are we?

06:49.080 --> 06:50.680
This guy gives me the creeps.

06:50.800 --> 06:53.760
Dick, wasn't
expecting you today.

06:53.880 --> 06:56.160
This is Wolf West.

06:56.280 --> 06:58.160
Dick Spiller.

06:58.280 --> 07:00.080
Thought I'd drop by and
say hello to my girls.

07:00.200 --> 07:00.960
Sure thing.

07:11.200 --> 07:13.520
Whoa.

07:13.640 --> 07:15.760
Did you get those
re-registrations done?

07:15.880 --> 07:16.720
All sorted, Mr. Lace.

07:23.640 --> 07:24.760
Where is that?

07:24.880 --> 07:26.160
In the wops.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.280
I could show you on a map.

07:28.400 --> 07:29.960
Good boy.

07:30.080 --> 07:30.960
Anything else we need to know?

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
What?

07:35.120 --> 07:36.360
Nothing.

07:36.480 --> 07:38.680
Just that Evan had some
shit to do with Spiller,

07:38.800 --> 07:40.360
so he let me drive his car home.

07:40.480 --> 07:43.200
He lets the likes of you touchhis most precious belongings?

07:43.320 --> 07:47.080
Yeah, Something
along those lines.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.080
We should get a move on.

07:49.200 --> 07:50.760
Stay right where you are.

07:50.880 --> 07:53.000
We don't want Evan
to beat us home.

07:53.120 --> 07:54.600
He'd wonder what held us up.

07:54.720 --> 07:57.640
So we tell him.

07:57.760 --> 08:01.120
OK, you're very sweet,but that's not gonna happen.

08:06.120 --> 08:10.160
And you need to
drive me home now.

08:10.280 --> 08:13.280
Why are you
doing this with me?

08:13.400 --> 08:14.440
I like it.

08:14.560 --> 08:15.800
It's fun.

08:15.920 --> 08:16.680
It's exciting.

08:19.720 --> 08:20.520
Don't you like it?

08:23.040 --> 08:23.800
Of course.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.440
Don't push it any further, OK?

08:31.720 --> 08:33.640
Why are you still with him?

08:33.760 --> 08:34.600
I like being with him.

08:37.320 --> 08:39.640
But you fuck around on him.

08:39.760 --> 08:40.760
Only because I like you.

08:45.360 --> 08:49.160
Would you still be with
him if he had nothing?

08:49.280 --> 08:51.680
I mean, I get why you're
sticking with him.

08:51.800 --> 08:55.120
You like the money,
the everything.

08:55.240 --> 08:57.880
That's fair enough.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.280
But one day, things
might be different.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.600
Oh, of course it might.

09:04.720 --> 09:05.960
No one even knows
what's coming tomorrow.

09:11.840 --> 09:14.360
Are you OK?

09:14.480 --> 09:16.120
You're right.

09:16.240 --> 09:19.920
You never know when shitmight be about to hit the fan.

09:20.040 --> 09:20.840
Better get you back.

09:24.640 --> 09:25.880
What?

09:26.000 --> 09:26.920
It was a great ride, is all.

09:30.040 --> 09:32.040
You need to talk to
Falani about those cars.

09:32.160 --> 09:34.720
Can I just say, it
is marvelous of you

09:34.840 --> 09:36.160
to bring us in on this job.

09:36.280 --> 09:37.160
You're my boys.

09:37.280 --> 09:38.920
It was always part of the plan.

09:39.040 --> 09:40.760
You all have skills that I need.

09:40.880 --> 09:41.960
Even me?

21:11.280 --> 21:13.840
to the suspect's house, seewhat else I can nail him for.

21:13.960 --> 21:14.760
I'll take care of that.

21:14.880 --> 21:16.200
You sure?

21:16.320 --> 21:18.640
Yeah, let him sit onhis ass for a bit longer.

21:18.760 --> 21:20.240
If he could sit on it.

21:20.360 --> 21:22.720
[chuckling]

21:22.840 --> 21:27.240
Ugh, shit, shit, shit.

21:27.360 --> 21:29.600
Just a once over, boys.

21:29.720 --> 21:31.760
Try not to make too muchof a bloody mess this time.

21:39.360 --> 21:42.960
Any chance of a Nesco,
then, Mrs. Munroe?

21:43.080 --> 21:43.840
Sit on the couch, girls.

21:49.600 --> 21:50.400
I'm sorry.

21:50.520 --> 21:51.480
Are you?

21:51.600 --> 21:53.560
This had nothing
to do with me.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.360
Well, it does now.

21:55.480 --> 21:58.640
He got caught red-handed,trying to rob an RSA.

21:58.760 --> 21:59.560
There are witnesses.

22:02.480 --> 22:05.000
Look, maybe this
is a good thing.

22:05.120 --> 22:07.520
He'll get a year, maybe18 months with his prior.

22:07.640 --> 22:09.440
It'll give me and you
some breathing space,

22:09.560 --> 22:12.000
time to be together,
work out what we want.

22:16.600 --> 22:17.840
My daughters have
already suffered

22:17.960 --> 22:19.600
the pain and humiliation
of their father

22:19.720 --> 22:21.680
going to jail once.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.400
I won't have them go
through that again.

22:23.520 --> 22:24.720
But he fucked up, Ngaire.

22:24.840 --> 22:26.640
But he needs to
walk away, Mike.

22:30.680 --> 22:36.320
If my husband goes inside,then you and I are over.

22:36.440 --> 22:42.760
Because if Lefty is in prisonand I'm shacked up with you,

22:42.880 --> 22:45.160
then they will think
I put him in there.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.280
But he put himself
there by being an idiot.

22:50.360 --> 22:54.520
Lefty walks, or I walk.

23:12.960 --> 23:13.800
Hey, there he is.

23:13.920 --> 23:16.240
There he is, my boy, Wolfie.

23:16.360 --> 23:17.280
My boy, Friday.

23:17.400 --> 23:18.880
Come here, mate.
This is Roger.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.200
This is Pam.
This is Lorraine.

23:20.320 --> 23:21.560
And blah, blah, blah.
What does it matter?

23:21.680 --> 23:23.000
You know?

23:23.120 --> 23:24.200
You're not gonna rememberanyone's names, are you?

23:24.320 --> 23:24.960
- Where am I this time?
- You're here.

23:25.080 --> 23:26.080
You're right here.

23:26.200 --> 23:27.000
We're gonna watch
the rugby later,

23:27.120 --> 23:28.240
so just have the day off.

23:28.360 --> 23:29.440
I didn't know you
were into rugby.

23:29.560 --> 23:30.760
I used to love it.

23:30.880 --> 23:31.760
Hey, Joanne.

23:31.880 --> 23:33.080
Joanne, oi.

23:33.200 --> 23:36.560
Get the boy a drink.

23:36.680 --> 23:37.520
Come this way, Wolf.

23:42.520 --> 23:44.240
It's completely
pissy-eyed already.

23:44.360 --> 23:46.080
Shane made breakfast
this morning.

23:46.200 --> 23:49.080
So he would hardly noticeif we packed off for a while.

23:49.200 --> 23:50.000
Settle, tiger.

23:53.360 --> 23:54.120
Here's a beer.

23:54.240 --> 23:55.040
Enjoy.

24:00.960 --> 24:03.480
Wolf West, aren't you?

24:03.600 --> 24:05.240
Yeah.

24:05.360 --> 24:07.360
Anyone asks, you
and I don't know

24:07.480 --> 24:08.960
each other from a bar of soap.

24:09.080 --> 24:11.160
But I don't know you
from a bar of soap.

24:11.280 --> 24:12.760
Exactly.

24:12.880 --> 24:14.960
No, I don't know.

24:15.080 --> 24:16.120
Who are you?

24:16.240 --> 24:17.360
Oh, for fuck's--

24:17.480 --> 24:18.920
I'm Des McEwen.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.080
You're Ted and Rita's boy.

24:20.200 --> 24:21.000
Yeah.

24:21.120 --> 24:23.680
So we do know each other.

24:23.800 --> 24:25.680
Except we don't.

24:25.800 --> 24:32.320
Because Evan, if he asks, thisconversation never happened.

24:42.080 --> 24:45.480
Going after the
big bucks, eh, Lefty?

24:45.600 --> 24:51.920
There was $23.17 on thepremises, in a petty cash box.

24:52.040 --> 24:53.560
The week's takings
went home with Hazel

24:53.680 --> 24:57.160
Maury, the bar manager.

24:57.280 --> 24:59.280
So what's going on here, Lefty?

24:59.400 --> 25:00.480
Is the gang losing its touch?

25:03.160 --> 25:05.680
I'm not saying a
word without a lawyer.

25:05.800 --> 25:07.120
Either the gang
is losing its touch,

25:07.240 --> 25:09.040
or someone's got this wrong.

25:09.160 --> 25:12.360
One, there was only
you, when everyone knows

25:12.480 --> 25:13.720
you run as a pack.

25:13.840 --> 25:15.080
So where were the others?

25:15.200 --> 25:17.760
Second, you're made out
to be a career criminal,

25:17.880 --> 25:20.080
but only a fucking bozo
would stuff up a robbery

25:20.200 --> 25:22.760
this spectacularly,
a fucking bozo.

25:22.880 --> 25:24.480
I'm not a bozo.

25:24.600 --> 25:26.360
No, you're not.

25:26.480 --> 25:28.080
Well, not usually.

25:28.200 --> 25:30.240
I mean, you're a
loathsome human being.

25:30.360 --> 25:31.120
Fuck you.

25:31.240 --> 25:33.840
Not actually a bozo.

25:33.960 --> 25:36.280
Which is why I'm so surprised.

25:36.400 --> 25:42.600
So tell me, why were you in thefacility of the Henderson RSA

25:42.720 --> 25:44.120
last night, Lefty?

25:44.240 --> 25:45.400
Who says I was?

25:45.520 --> 25:46.960
The people who
shot you in the ass

25:47.080 --> 25:50.600
and found you lying on theground crying like a girl!

25:50.720 --> 25:54.360
So tell me, why were
you in the vicinity

25:54.480 --> 25:58.600
of the carpark of theHenderson RSA last night?

26:02.760 --> 26:05.480
Was it your intention
to rob the RSA?

26:07.920 --> 26:09.080
- No.
- No?

26:09.200 --> 26:10.000
Right.

26:12.800 --> 26:14.040
So you were in the area because?

26:18.360 --> 26:20.120
Because I was walking our dog.

26:20.240 --> 26:21.360
You haven't got a dog.

26:21.480 --> 26:22.840
Yeah, we do.

26:22.960 --> 26:26.160
Are you sure you have a dog?

26:26.280 --> 26:27.720
Yes.

26:27.840 --> 26:30.720
There's no mention of a doganywhere in the paperwork.

26:30.840 --> 26:33.600
Because he ran off when
the shooting started.

26:33.720 --> 26:37.960
It's probably out there
now, hiding, terrified.

26:38.080 --> 26:41.400
It's called Muldoon.

26:41.520 --> 26:42.760
Sorry, what?

26:42.880 --> 26:44.000
MIKE [ON PHONE]: Go to
a pet shop of the SPCA

26:44.120 --> 26:45.720
and get yourself a dog.

26:45.840 --> 26:47.000
Why?

26:47.120 --> 26:48.040
MIKE [ON PHONE]: Because
your husband isn't

26:48.160 --> 26:49.080
making this very bloody easy.

26:49.200 --> 26:50.440
That's why.

26:50.560 --> 26:52.800
He could have said he
was out jogging, but no.

26:52.920 --> 26:55.360
He had to introduce
a dog into the story.

26:55.480 --> 26:56.520
Right, we have a dog.

26:56.640 --> 26:57.720
Did he say what
kind of dog we have?

26:57.840 --> 27:00.520
No, but it's called Muldoon.

27:00.640 --> 27:01.720
Muldoon?

27:01.840 --> 27:02.880
MIKE [ON PHONE]: Yeah.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.240
Who the fuck names
a dog "Muldoon"?

27:05.360 --> 27:06.680
We have a line,
and he crossed it.

27:06.800 --> 27:07.560
I know.

27:07.680 --> 27:08.760
And he got caught.

27:08.880 --> 27:10.720
Yeah, good fucking job.

27:10.840 --> 27:13.920
That lying, deceiving
piece of shite.

27:14.040 --> 27:15.320
He can rot inside
for all I care.

27:15.440 --> 27:17.640
[door opens]

27:17.760 --> 27:18.840
Hey.

27:18.960 --> 27:19.760
Hi.

27:23.120 --> 27:24.560
Everything all right?

27:24.680 --> 27:26.680
Yeah, he'll be fine.

27:26.800 --> 27:28.640
How was your day?

27:28.760 --> 27:31.760
I drank beer and watched therugby with Evan and his mates.

27:31.880 --> 27:33.520
So he's paying you tobe his drinking buddy now?

27:33.640 --> 27:34.400
It was a party.

27:37.520 --> 27:38.880
Hey, who's Des McEwen?

27:39.000 --> 27:40.400
Why?

27:40.520 --> 27:41.600
Because he introducedhimself to me, and then told me

27:41.720 --> 27:42.600
I didn't know him.

27:42.720 --> 27:43.480
That's fine.

27:43.600 --> 27:46.320
You don't wanna know him.

27:46.440 --> 27:48.240
Des got us the in with Evan.

27:48.360 --> 27:49.440
He got you the job.

27:49.560 --> 27:51.040
Why?

27:51.160 --> 27:53.160
Because apparently, if wewait a while before we hit Evan,

27:53.280 --> 27:54.960
there'll be a
shitload more cash.

27:55.080 --> 27:55.920
And we know this how?

28:01.000 --> 28:02.320
So who am I selling it to?

28:02.440 --> 28:03.960
The Wellington
property in Gisborne

28:04.080 --> 28:06.880
County who once sold it to acompany listed in [inaudible]..

28:07.000 --> 28:08.240
So there's nothing
linking me directly

28:08.360 --> 28:09.800
to our South African friends?

28:09.920 --> 28:11.640
Well, only a large amountof cash in your possession.

28:11.760 --> 28:12.920
Just don't worry about that.

28:13.040 --> 28:14.360
Hey, if you want a
hand divesting it--

28:14.480 --> 28:15.560
No, no.

28:15.680 --> 28:16.800
It's gonna sit in
there for a while.

28:16.920 --> 28:17.640
Well, I could be
making it work for--

28:17.760 --> 28:19.240
Des, I'm fine.
OK?

28:19.360 --> 28:21.240
Next time you speak to thosecharming yarpie bastards,

28:21.360 --> 28:23.040
you tell that they
win the final test,

28:23.160 --> 28:25.120
I'll take 25 grand
off the asking price.

28:25.240 --> 28:28.560
If they lose, I'll
put 25 grand on.

28:28.680 --> 28:29.720
Price for what?

28:29.840 --> 28:31.160
Dunno.

28:31.280 --> 28:32.360
But if Evan's about tocome into some more coin,

28:32.480 --> 28:33.400
we should wait and find out.

28:33.520 --> 28:34.280
That's all.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.240
Yeah.
Thanks, love.

28:38.360 --> 28:39.120
We should think about that.

28:53.640 --> 28:55.040
What's up, love?

28:55.160 --> 28:58.160
This job you're hangout for, tell me about it.

28:58.280 --> 29:00.160
Come on, you know we nevertalk about that sort of stuff.

29:00.280 --> 29:01.520
Make an exception.

29:01.640 --> 29:03.600
It involves a bunch of
South Africans, right?

29:03.720 --> 29:04.720
Maybe, why?

29:04.840 --> 29:05.680
Ted, the boys
have been calling

29:05.800 --> 29:06.720
it "the South African Job."

29:06.840 --> 29:07.880
Yeah, yeah.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.360
It involves a bunch
of yarpies, yes.

29:09.480 --> 29:11.080
And Des set it
up for you, right?

29:11.200 --> 29:12.360
Yeah.
Yeah, he did.

29:12.480 --> 29:13.240
Why?

29:16.920 --> 29:17.800
Rita, why?

29:21.320 --> 29:23.080
We need to talk to Des.

29:23.200 --> 29:25.520
Why?

29:25.640 --> 29:27.000
Our jobs are intersecting.

29:27.120 --> 29:27.920
Jobs?

29:28.040 --> 29:29.160
What jobs?

29:29.280 --> 29:31.680
Mine and yours.

29:31.800 --> 29:33.400
Yes, Ted.

29:33.520 --> 29:34.920
I have a "job" job.

29:35.040 --> 29:36.240
Like yours.

29:36.360 --> 29:39.200
Since when does my
wife have a "job" job?

29:39.320 --> 29:40.120
Ted.

29:40.240 --> 29:42.240
Hey, Rita.

29:42.360 --> 29:43.240
Can you give us a minute?

29:43.360 --> 29:44.680
No, can you give us a minute?

29:44.800 --> 29:45.840
But this is bad.

29:45.960 --> 29:48.600
This is about Lefty.

29:48.720 --> 29:49.520
I'll give you a minute.

29:52.280 --> 29:53.560
I already know what he did.

29:53.680 --> 29:55.880
Had the bloody copsaround here this morning.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.320
I'm so sorry, Ted.

29:57.440 --> 29:58.840
I'm so bloody sorry.

29:58.960 --> 29:59.800
Why the hell are you sorry?

30:02.720 --> 30:04.360
Oh, piss off!

30:04.480 --> 30:05.520
You were in on it.

30:05.640 --> 30:08.000
And what about the others?

30:08.120 --> 30:09.200
Bert, Bilkey?

30:09.320 --> 30:10.800
No, just me and Lefty.

30:10.920 --> 30:12.960
We needed to do this one thing'cause of being so skint.

30:13.080 --> 30:15.000
You went against the
wishes of the gang.

30:15.120 --> 30:16.400
We weren't gonna
make a habit of going

30:16.520 --> 30:17.600
on our own or anything.

30:17.720 --> 30:18.920
We was punished.

30:19.040 --> 30:21.000
Carol rang Ngaire, who
said Lefty got shot.

30:21.120 --> 30:21.920
What?

30:22.040 --> 30:23.200
In the ass.

30:23.320 --> 30:24.360
And arrested.

30:24.480 --> 30:25.640
And me?

30:25.760 --> 30:27.040
I feel so sick.

30:27.160 --> 30:28.600
My head hurts.

30:28.720 --> 30:30.480
I've got a dry mouth.

30:30.600 --> 30:32.360
I feel like I'm coming
down with something.

30:32.480 --> 30:33.480
Maybe cancer.

30:33.600 --> 30:35.120
Trying to rob
returned soldiers,

30:35.240 --> 30:37.400
God probably is
punishing you, yeah.

30:37.520 --> 30:41.720
And Lefty, with his prior,he's gonna go away for this.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.200
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

30:43.320 --> 30:44.320
Good work, Phineas.

30:44.440 --> 30:46.160
Just when we need
the whole gang.

30:46.280 --> 30:47.040
Good fucking work.

30:51.440 --> 30:54.040
Hate to tell you this, mate,but your RSA case is bullshit.

30:54.160 --> 30:54.960
Eh?

30:55.080 --> 30:56.360
We've got nothing usable.

30:56.480 --> 30:57.240
Nothing?

30:57.360 --> 30:58.360
You're shitting me.

30:58.480 --> 30:59.600
The bastard was
caught in the act.

30:59.720 --> 31:02.560
Munroe allegedly
went inside the RSA.

31:02.680 --> 31:03.560
To rob it.

31:03.680 --> 31:05.240
He told them it was a robbery.

31:05.360 --> 31:07.480
This would be the group of oldage pensioners drinking, right?

31:07.600 --> 31:08.920
TERRY: Yes.

31:09.040 --> 31:10.760
Well after closing time,thus breaking the law

31:10.880 --> 31:12.120
and probably drunk.

31:12.240 --> 31:13.760
Not great as witnesses go.

31:13.880 --> 31:15.680
They chased him out into thecarpark and apprehended him.

31:15.800 --> 31:16.640
So they say.

31:16.760 --> 31:17.840
Because it's what they did.

31:17.960 --> 31:19.760
After they
brandished a firearm

31:19.880 --> 31:22.080
and shot him in the buttock.

31:22.200 --> 31:24.480
An unregistered,
Illegal firearm.

31:24.600 --> 31:26.080
It's a war souvenir.

31:26.200 --> 31:28.240
That this old codger justhappens to take out drinking?

31:28.360 --> 31:30.400
Yeah, that'll fly in court.

31:30.520 --> 31:33.400
Meanwhile, Munroe claims hewas out walking his dog when

31:33.520 --> 31:36.760
a mob of drunk ex-servicemen,mistaking him for a robber,

31:36.880 --> 31:39.200
assaulted him, and then
shot him in the buttock

31:39.320 --> 31:40.520
when he tried to flee.

31:40.640 --> 31:42.640
But they saw Munroe
inside the RSA.

31:42.760 --> 31:45.520
They saw a man in abalaclava inside the RSA.

31:45.640 --> 31:47.520
They took the balaclava
off him in the carpark.

31:47.640 --> 31:49.440
It's the middle of
the night, in the middle

31:49.560 --> 31:50.480
of fucking winter, Terry.

31:50.600 --> 31:52.080
It's cold.

31:52.200 --> 31:53.400
Munroe claims he was wearingit on top of his head as one

31:53.520 --> 31:54.520
of those-- what
do you call them?

31:54.640 --> 31:55.800
A beanie.
MIKE: Yeah, one of them.

31:58.520 --> 31:59.600
Why are you doing this?

31:59.720 --> 32:00.480
Doing what?

32:00.600 --> 32:01.800
Killing the case.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.880
Mate, I'm trying to
save you from killing

32:04.000 --> 32:05.640
your career by pushing
this dog of a case

32:05.760 --> 32:08.400
any further than it needs to go.

32:08.520 --> 32:10.960
Speaking of which, I found it.- Found what?

32:11.080 --> 32:13.280
Munroe's dog, the
one he was out walking.

32:13.400 --> 32:14.760
Turned up at his home.

32:26.440 --> 32:29.640
Lefty, Lefty, Lefty.

32:29.760 --> 32:31.920
Actually, they were
only inches away

32:32.040 --> 32:33.680
from getting the other gonad.

32:33.800 --> 32:36.160
Then what would we call you?

32:36.280 --> 32:38.640
I want my lawyer.

32:38.760 --> 32:40.960
Not exactly an auspiciousstart to your solo career,

32:41.080 --> 32:41.960
was it?

32:42.080 --> 32:44.600
Getting nicked robbing an RSA.

32:44.720 --> 32:48.640
Man, that won't exactly getyou a warm welcome in prison,

32:48.760 --> 32:50.200
will it?

32:50.320 --> 32:53.360
Stealing from our soldiers,from the decent, good men

32:53.480 --> 32:55.040
who fought for us.

32:55.160 --> 32:57.920
There'll be blokes
inside just waiting

32:58.040 --> 33:01.000
to do over a maggot like you.

33:01.120 --> 33:05.800
And from what I hear, you didn'tdo so well inside last time,

33:05.920 --> 33:06.840
did you?

33:06.960 --> 33:08.520
There were incidents.

33:08.640 --> 33:11.200
You needed to be segregatedfrom the general population just

33:11.320 --> 33:14.920
for your own safety,
didn't you, Lefty?

33:15.040 --> 33:16.000
I'll give you Ted West.

33:18.960 --> 33:21.120
Sorry?

33:21.240 --> 33:23.480
No one got hurt.

33:23.600 --> 33:25.800
No money was taken.

33:25.920 --> 33:28.600
It's a nothing case.

33:28.720 --> 33:30.920
Get me off it, and
I will get you Ted.

33:36.960 --> 33:39.000
So all this time, Wolf'sonly been working for this guy

33:39.120 --> 33:40.480
to set up the job.

33:40.600 --> 33:42.160
Yeah, do you reallythink I'd want him working

33:42.280 --> 33:43.680
for that asshole otherwise?

33:43.800 --> 33:45.600
I did wonder.

33:45.720 --> 33:47.280
Really thought this
through, didn't you?

33:47.400 --> 33:48.640
Never doubt me, Ted.

33:48.760 --> 33:49.600
Oh, I never have.

33:54.080 --> 33:55.320
Remind me why we're here again.

33:55.440 --> 33:56.880
Because we need toknow that we're not gonna

33:57.000 --> 34:00.240
mess up each other's jobs.
- Fair enough.

34:05.760 --> 34:06.600
[groaning]

34:06.720 --> 34:07.760
What the hell was that?

34:07.880 --> 34:08.680
Wait here.

34:12.040 --> 34:12.960
[groaning]

34:13.080 --> 34:13.880
DES: Jesus Christ!

34:30.320 --> 34:31.680
I told you to wait outside.

34:31.800 --> 34:32.600
No.

34:32.720 --> 34:35.080
[groaning]

34:37.680 --> 34:40.040
[groaning]

34:42.640 --> 34:45.000
[screaming]

34:48.040 --> 34:48.840
Thank you, mistress!

34:48.960 --> 34:50.960
Oh, Jesus Christ.

34:51.080 --> 34:52.400
Jesus Christ!

34:52.520 --> 34:54.080
What the bloody hell are
you doing in my place?

34:54.200 --> 34:56.680
- Oh, my God.- You are invading my privacy.

34:56.800 --> 34:58.720
Not for long,
if we can help it.

34:58.840 --> 35:00.360
Love, would you mind
waiting outside?

35:02.520 --> 35:03.320
Move it.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.360
You do realize I am paying forthis by the hour, in advance.

35:16.640 --> 35:19.640
My wife and I are just alittle bit confused, Des.

35:19.760 --> 35:21.480
I enjoy pain, OK?

35:21.600 --> 35:22.760
Not about that.

35:22.880 --> 35:24.600
What the fuck is
going on with you, Evan

35:24.720 --> 35:27.800
Lace, and these South Africans?- Um.

35:27.920 --> 35:29.360
Well, me and the boys
are meant to be chasing

35:29.480 --> 35:31.560
the South African money, right?- Uh, yeah.

35:31.680 --> 35:32.880
We need to talk about that.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.560
And what's Lace
got to do with it?

35:34.680 --> 35:37.080
Well, he's the one
selling them the land.

35:37.200 --> 35:39.960
So you're trying
to rip him off.

35:40.080 --> 35:41.440
No.

35:41.560 --> 35:43.320
Well, yeah, maybe
I am, in a way.

35:43.440 --> 35:44.920
If Ted does his
bloody job right,

35:45.040 --> 35:46.640
Lace will still have
his land, but no buyer.

35:46.760 --> 35:49.400
So there's no real loss.

35:49.520 --> 35:51.520
Why are we having this
conversation, anyway?

35:51.640 --> 35:53.400
Because Rita's doing
a job on Lace too.

35:53.520 --> 35:55.480
Is that why your boy
is working for him?

35:55.600 --> 35:56.960
Yes.

35:57.080 --> 35:58.720
And I don't want him gettingcaught up in whatever

35:58.840 --> 36:01.240
other shit you've got going on.

36:01.360 --> 36:02.680
Involving your
son in your crimes.

36:02.800 --> 36:04.560
It's a learning
experience for him.

36:04.680 --> 36:07.880
And you're not really
in a position to judge.

36:08.000 --> 36:08.760
True.

36:08.880 --> 36:10.400
Anyway, it's too late.

36:10.520 --> 36:12.560
He's already involved in myother shit, which is his shit.

36:12.680 --> 36:13.880
How?

36:14.000 --> 36:15.320
Well, this is what
we need to talk about.

36:15.440 --> 36:16.880
They wanna meet the boatand the money in Whangarei

36:17.000 --> 36:18.360
on the Tuesday before
the final test.

36:18.480 --> 36:19.280
Really?

36:19.400 --> 36:20.480
For a fact this time.

36:20.600 --> 36:22.160
What's this got
to do with Wolf?

36:22.280 --> 36:25.400
Well, we needed someone we cantrust, so Evan suggested Wolf.

36:25.520 --> 36:28.000
Boy, did he pick
the wrong person.

36:28.120 --> 36:30.080
Hey, you could hit the
van on the way back.

36:30.200 --> 36:31.840
No, no, no, no, no.

36:31.960 --> 36:33.200
Not with my son in there.

36:33.320 --> 36:34.960
Oh, now you care for
the welfare of your boy.

36:38.080 --> 36:38.840
Ugh!

36:38.960 --> 36:40.120
Oof.

36:40.240 --> 36:41.800
Jesus Christ, you are
very good at that.

36:46.360 --> 36:48.000
You two figure it out.

36:48.120 --> 36:50.520
You sure we haven'ttalked about any of this?

36:50.640 --> 36:53.400
You know, communication isthe key to any great marriage.

36:53.520 --> 36:54.360
[chuckling]

36:54.480 --> 36:55.360
Thanks for that, Des.

36:58.720 --> 37:00.120
I'll see your friend back in.

37:00.240 --> 37:01.040
Oh, yeah, that'd be great.

37:01.160 --> 37:01.960
Thanks.

37:07.120 --> 37:09.280
I guess while
Wolf's up in Whangarei

37:09.400 --> 37:10.920
it'll be a good
time to do your job.

37:11.040 --> 37:14.080
Yeah, he'll be
safely out of the way.

37:14.200 --> 37:15.760
Des said you can go home, love.

37:18.480 --> 37:20.520
So how come you nevertold me you had a job on?

37:20.640 --> 37:23.040
I tried to, but you
always said something

37:23.160 --> 37:25.680
stupid that stopped me.

37:25.800 --> 37:27.040
Hell.

37:27.160 --> 37:29.120
Plus I knew that
if I brought you in,

37:29.240 --> 37:31.880
you'd bring the gang in, andmy cut would get smaller.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.720
I'm not sure there
is a gang anymore.

37:33.840 --> 37:35.640
There better bloody be.

37:35.760 --> 37:38.160
To get that South African money.

37:38.280 --> 37:39.920
Yeah, there is that.

37:43.240 --> 37:46.680
Ted, if I told you therewas a small safe job as part

37:46.800 --> 37:50.520
of my job, do you think youcould do it, on the side,

37:50.640 --> 37:52.120
as it were?

37:52.240 --> 37:53.400
Of course.

37:53.520 --> 37:55.480
Totally within the rules.

37:55.600 --> 37:59.440
You and me, a double act.

37:59.560 --> 38:01.680
Yeah.

38:01.800 --> 38:03.200
I quite like it.

38:03.320 --> 38:04.120
Me too.

38:08.280 --> 38:09.480
Lorraine?

38:09.600 --> 38:10.360
Lorraine?

38:16.520 --> 38:18.360
Jesus, what the
hell is this thing?

38:18.480 --> 38:20.120
Some cop called and
asked if we had a dog,

38:20.240 --> 38:22.440
so I figured we did.

38:22.560 --> 38:23.400
Of course.

38:23.520 --> 38:24.400
Good work, love.

38:31.960 --> 38:34.320
[barking]

38:49.280 --> 38:50.080
Sorry I'm late.

38:53.680 --> 38:55.440
No need to be upset.

38:55.560 --> 38:57.400
I'm only two minutes late.

38:57.520 --> 38:58.440
No, it's not that.

38:58.560 --> 38:59.640
Shut up, all right?

39:13.280 --> 39:15.680
OK, before you say anything--

39:15.800 --> 39:17.600
ah, shit, my ass!

39:17.720 --> 39:18.840
What's happening?

39:18.960 --> 39:20.040
Turns out, these
two had a side job.

39:20.160 --> 39:22.840
I'm fucking sorry, Ted.

39:22.960 --> 39:23.840
I mean it.
I fucked up.

39:23.960 --> 39:25.000
We all agreed.

39:25.120 --> 39:26.280
We all said we
don't touch the RSA.

39:26.400 --> 39:27.640
Who touched the RSA?

39:27.760 --> 39:29.600
I don't know why I did it.

39:29.720 --> 39:31.000
I barely remember anything.

39:31.120 --> 39:34.160
We did it because we wereon the bones of our ass.

39:34.280 --> 39:36.520
You keep saying the SouthAfrican money is gonna be here.

39:36.640 --> 39:37.640
Yeah, and it will be.

39:37.760 --> 39:41.160
And I know where,
and I know when.

39:41.280 --> 39:43.880
We've been waiting
all this time,

39:44.000 --> 39:46.680
and just when we're aboutto go, you go and pull

39:46.800 --> 39:48.400
a fucking stunt like this.

39:48.520 --> 39:49.600
I know.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.080
I should have
listened to you, Ted.

39:51.200 --> 39:54.000
I got a bullet in the
ass to prove that.

39:54.120 --> 39:56.720
Hand on heart, I'm sorry, Ted.

39:56.840 --> 40:00.480
If we didn't need you forthis job, you'd be fucking gone.

40:00.600 --> 40:01.400
Do you get that?

40:04.120 --> 40:07.880
Do you understand that?

40:08.000 --> 40:08.800
Yeah, I do.

40:14.800 --> 40:16.520
You got one shot
to make this right.

40:16.640 --> 40:17.760
One shot.

40:17.880 --> 40:20.120
I know.

40:20.240 --> 40:21.160
And I won't let you down, mate.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.160
[music playing]

40:41.280 --> 40:42.080
[SINGING] Judas.

40:50.360 --> 40:51.200
How did you do it?

40:51.320 --> 40:53.360
Old Lefty [inaudible] time.

40:53.480 --> 40:55.000
I'll give you Ted West.

40:55.120 --> 40:56.640
You made him a nark.

40:56.760 --> 40:59.120
No, he offered up his matejust like that to save himself.

40:59.240 --> 41:00.440
How did you get off?

41:00.560 --> 41:01.880
I thought you'd
do time for sure.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.560
Cops, fucking bozos.

41:03.680 --> 41:05.360
But if you go after
Ted, then Rita will--

41:05.480 --> 41:08.120
I'm not going after Ted.

41:08.240 --> 41:09.760
All I want Lefty to
tell me is exactly

41:09.880 --> 41:14.440
where the gang are gonna beon what day and at what time.

41:14.560 --> 41:16.880
For example, right
now, I know they're

41:17.000 --> 41:20.880
drinking in Ted's backyard, andthey'll be there for some time.

41:24.240 --> 41:28.320
To all of us, united,
never to be split again.

41:28.440 --> 41:31.480
I'll drink to that.

41:31.600 --> 41:33.880
I'll drink to the SouthAfrican job, soon to be done

41:34.000 --> 41:35.120
and dusted.

41:35.240 --> 41:36.000
Yeah.

41:36.120 --> 41:37.040
Thank God for that.

41:42.160 --> 41:42.920
Hello?

41:50.920 --> 41:53.280
SONG: Time spans the ages.

41:53.400 --> 41:55.040
Oh, hey, here he is.

41:55.160 --> 41:56.360
You wanted to see me?

41:56.480 --> 41:58.640
Yeah, go get us some
brandy, sweetheart.

42:08.040 --> 42:10.040
I got a nice, little job
for you, if you want it.

42:10.160 --> 42:12.680
Fancy a trip up to
the winterless north?

42:12.800 --> 42:14.560
I go where you tell me to.

42:14.680 --> 42:17.080
Tuesday week, I need adriver to take some people up

42:17.200 --> 42:19.960
to Whangarei, watch thegame against North Auckland

42:20.080 --> 42:21.840
and then take them out
on a little boat trip

42:21.960 --> 42:23.000
they've organized.

42:23.120 --> 42:24.000
OK.

42:24.120 --> 42:26.160
They're bastards, by the way.

42:26.280 --> 42:27.160
South Africans.

42:27.280 --> 42:28.600
Complete assholes of men.

42:34.920 --> 42:36.960
What are you
doing Tuesday, then?

42:37.080 --> 42:38.400
I have no idea.

42:38.520 --> 42:39.920
I don't plan that far ahead.

42:40.040 --> 42:41.040
Why?

42:41.160 --> 42:43.720
I'm going up north for a bit.

42:43.840 --> 42:48.080
And you-- you need
to be somewhere else.

42:48.200 --> 42:51.200
Like where?

42:51.320 --> 42:52.120
Nowhere near this place.

42:56.640 --> 42:57.480
All right.

43:01.240 --> 43:02.920
Lefty.

43:03.040 --> 43:04.160
He had it coming.

43:04.280 --> 43:05.040
He did.

43:05.160 --> 43:05.920
Yeah.

43:09.040 --> 43:10.200
I dunno.

43:10.320 --> 43:14.600
Maybe the gang-- maybe
it's had its day.

43:17.840 --> 43:20.040
Maybe there's a new way.

43:20.160 --> 43:23.640
Me, you, the boy.

43:23.760 --> 43:26.640
The Wests against the rest.

43:26.760 --> 43:28.000
I like that.

43:28.120 --> 43:30.400
[music - the newmatics, "judas"]

43:30.520 --> 43:36.120
[SINGING] 12 pieces of silverin the sands below the town.

43:36.240 --> 43:40.920
The fact of the matteris, Judas is getting bold.

43:41.040 --> 43:47.200
The fact of the matter is,you can't mix peace and gold.

43:47.320 --> 43:52.320
The fact of the matteris, Judas is getting bold.

43:52.440 --> 43:56.200
The fact of the matter is,you can't mix peace and gold.

44:04.720 --> 44:06.160
Judas.
