WEBVTT

00:18.920 --> 00:20.680
[explosion]

00:30.400 --> 00:31.440
This way!

00:36.000 --> 00:37.080
Mangle save!

00:37.160 --> 00:38.600
Come on, everyone!

00:38.680 --> 00:41.120
-Follow me!
-[Lanista] Right behind you, Ariston!

01:33.000 --> 01:33.840
Oh!

01:34.800 --> 01:35.640
[whimpers]

01:36.680 --> 01:39.840
[roars and grunts]

01:39.920 --> 01:41.480
[groans]

01:43.160 --> 01:44.600
-Ya!
-[groans]

01:45.080 --> 01:46.640
[groans]

01:47.160 --> 01:49.080
-[buzzing]
-[gasps for breath]

01:49.640 --> 01:51.640
[screams]

02:02.080 --> 02:04.920
[light snoring]

02:06.240 --> 02:08.800
Huh! Only a dream.

02:47.560 --> 02:49.400
Enough with the dream already, man!

02:49.480 --> 02:52.120
Aw, it was so real, Chike.

02:52.200 --> 02:53.640
Danuvia surrendered.

02:53.720 --> 02:55.640
I knocked out Vermis with one punch.

02:55.720 --> 02:57.360
Then it was definitely a dream.

02:57.440 --> 02:59.720
But what if we can make it real?

02:59.800 --> 03:03.920
If we can get everyone to fight, then...
[grunts]

03:04.000 --> 03:05.600
goodbye, Corvus!

03:05.680 --> 03:07.480
[Lanista chuckles] Forget it, kid.

03:07.560 --> 03:12.400
In this world, there's no room for dreams,
yours, mine, anybody's.

03:12.680 --> 03:15.040
Remember when we tried to save Feronia?

03:15.120 --> 03:19.240
We barely got out alive.
Corvus runs everything.

03:19.320 --> 03:22.480
It isn't fair or right,
but that's how it is.

03:22.560 --> 03:25.360
And believe me, we're the lucky ones.
As long as--

03:25.440 --> 03:28.760
We play their Robozuna games, we survive.

03:28.840 --> 03:33.800
Yes, and that's all that matters.
This isn't a dream. It's real life.

03:34.360 --> 03:38.080
Now, speaking of Robozuna, why don't
you two check on the Combatabots?

03:38.480 --> 03:41.320
-Right! On it!
-I don't get it, Dad.

03:41.400 --> 03:45.320
Everything Ariston's talking about,
that was your dream, too.

03:45.400 --> 03:48.040
Yeah, it was... once. Things change.

03:57.960 --> 04:01.680
So, you're a Robozuna Team, eh?

04:01.760 --> 04:02.960
That's right, Corporal.

04:03.480 --> 04:04.920
It's Sergeant Farrago...

04:05.440 --> 04:08.320
with the Corvus Imperium Security Force.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.840
I report directly to Commander Vermis,
you know?

04:12.800 --> 04:14.000
How nice for you.

04:17.560 --> 04:20.720
[sniffs] Whoa, what smells?

04:20.800 --> 04:22.000
The whole town.

04:22.080 --> 04:25.000
Burnum sits on an underground pool
of natural gas.

04:25.080 --> 04:27.720
And that is why
this place literally stinks.

04:28.240 --> 04:29.600
Look there.

04:29.680 --> 04:34.080
<i>Hello! Robozuna Fans! Ha-ha!</i>

04:34.160 --> 04:36.920
<i>It's a beautiful day here at Burnum Arena.</i>

04:37.000 --> 04:38.800
Ho! Isn't that right, Slick?

04:38.880 --> 04:43.960
[coughs] Sure is, Spanner,
if you don't mind the stinky air!

04:44.040 --> 04:45.400
[coughs]

04:45.480 --> 04:48.120
Ah, you breathers, so sensitive.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.320
[Slick coughs]

04:49.400 --> 04:52.320
Now, let's talk about
today's Robozuna game

04:52.400 --> 04:55.200
between Team Veredus and Team Vulpes.

04:55.480 --> 04:59.680
As you know, Team Vulpes makes up
for their smaller size with speed

04:59.760 --> 05:01.960
and lots of surprises! [chuckles]

05:02.400 --> 05:05.600
Pincer, the terror talons tear-up!

05:06.040 --> 05:09.960
Crank, the ratchet-comin'-atcha!

05:10.640 --> 05:14.760
Brawler, the windmill spin and win!

05:15.640 --> 05:17.400
<i>You're the masher basher...</i>

05:17.480 --> 05:18.960
Nah, they don't look so tough.

05:19.320 --> 05:20.160
Hm?

05:20.880 --> 05:23.000
[squeals]

05:24.680 --> 05:28.480
Don't let their size fool you.
I hear they're fast and strong.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.320
-It's Team Veredus!
-Robozuna!

05:32.400 --> 05:33.680
-Yeah!
-Robozuna!

05:33.760 --> 05:35.800
-The greatest!
-[boy] Go, Team Veredus!

05:35.880 --> 05:38.480
-[boy] You guys rock!
-[girl] Mangle! Mangle!

05:38.560 --> 05:40.760
Hear that? They like us!

05:40.840 --> 05:42.040
Mangle!

05:42.840 --> 05:45.400
Uh-uh. Like Mangle.

05:45.480 --> 05:48.480
Don't let it go to your heads.
Fans can turn on you in the blink of--

05:48.560 --> 05:49.480
[boom]

05:49.560 --> 05:53.960
[announcer] <i>This is an urgent bulletin</i>
<i>from the Corvus Imperium Truth Ministry.</i>

05:54.040 --> 05:58.320
[spokesman] <i>Fellow Citizens,</i>
<i>once again, a band of vile criminals</i>

05:58.400 --> 06:01.320
<i>has disturbed the tranquillity</i>
<i>of our glorious land.</i>

06:01.400 --> 06:05.880
<i>Their latest treachery,</i>
<i>a brutal attack on a food factory</i>

06:05.960 --> 06:09.760
<i>to steal rations meant for you,</i>
<i>the loyal and steadfast.</i>

06:09.840 --> 06:12.040
[scoffs] More like loyal and starving!

06:12.120 --> 06:14.320
A food factory? Ha!

06:14.400 --> 06:17.040
Sorry, what were you were saying?

06:19.280 --> 06:20.840
Mm! Huh!

06:22.840 --> 06:26.840
That's no factory! It's the prison
where they've locked up Feronia!

06:26.920 --> 06:28.680
Yeah. They're not fooling anyone.

06:28.760 --> 06:31.120
<i>If you can identify</i>
<i>any of these parasites,</i>

06:31.200 --> 06:32.560
<i>report them at once.</i>

06:32.640 --> 06:34.680
<i>You will be rewarded for your service.</i>

06:35.080 --> 06:37.200
At least they didn't see our faces.

06:37.280 --> 06:39.080
Uh, with one exception.

06:40.480 --> 06:44.480
<i>We particularly seek the arrest</i>
<i>of this man, Niven Lengil.</i>

06:44.560 --> 06:48.880
<i>We believe he is the outlaws' leader</i>
<i>and a threat to the Corvus Imperium!</i>

06:48.960 --> 06:51.000
<i>All hail Caesar Malum!</i>

06:51.480 --> 06:53.480
Everybody inside... now!

07:16.240 --> 07:17.720
Burnum Arena's up ahead.

07:17.800 --> 07:19.400
We have to warn Niven!

07:20.200 --> 07:21.080
[radio static]

07:21.160 --> 07:23.640
What I wouldn't give
for a Corvus communicator.

07:23.720 --> 07:25.720
This bootleg tech barely works.

07:26.440 --> 07:29.240
Niven! It's Ariston! Where are you?

07:29.640 --> 07:33.480
Just outside of Burnum.
We scored a tanker of natural gas.

07:33.560 --> 07:36.080
Enough to run
six communal kitchens for a--

07:36.160 --> 07:40.000
You got to get away! The Truth Ministry
put a reward out for you.

07:40.080 --> 07:41.920
Will do. Thanks for the warning.

07:44.600 --> 07:49.680
Hello, Mr Lengil. My name is Illex
and this is my associate, Kilowatt.

07:49.760 --> 07:53.960
And now that we have you,
this will be a very profitable day for us.

07:57.120 --> 07:58.440
Use the snare.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.600
[groans]

08:06.600 --> 08:08.400
Uh-uh. Don't touch.

08:11.240 --> 08:12.720
[bleeping]

08:13.240 --> 08:15.600
Oh, it's that pest again.

08:16.240 --> 08:20.480
Illex, we've been over this.
I have an army at my disposal.

08:20.560 --> 08:23.400
So, I don't need any bounty hunter to--

08:23.480 --> 08:26.000
Even one who's caught
the outlaw you're after?

08:26.080 --> 08:28.200
You captured Niven Lengil?

08:28.280 --> 08:30.920
<i>I did. Now, where shall I bring him?</i>

08:31.000 --> 08:33.360
Send your coordinates. I'll come to you.

08:34.320 --> 08:36.200
Huh. [grunts softly]

08:45.040 --> 08:48.840
-Any luck with Spark's taser-fist?
-Nope. Still won't work.

08:49.440 --> 08:50.440
Come on, Spark.

08:50.520 --> 08:52.880
We'll see if we have
any spare parts in the transporter.

08:53.240 --> 08:56.400
Good news. I've been teaching
Clunk and Spark some new tricks!

08:56.480 --> 08:58.320
You mean, like, Robozuna moves?

08:58.400 --> 09:00.360
Even better! Check this out!

09:00.440 --> 09:05.400
Your mother was a carburettor.
Your father was a vending machine.

09:07.400 --> 09:09.400
-What is that?
-Trash talk.

09:09.480 --> 09:10.760
Programmed him myself.

09:10.840 --> 09:14.480
It'll totally throw off his opponents
during the game. Try it again.

09:14.560 --> 09:17.200
I've seen broken-down bots faster than me.

09:17.920 --> 09:19.680
No, it's faster than you.

09:20.400 --> 09:23.120
That's what I said, faster than me.

09:23.800 --> 09:24.680
[sighs]

09:24.760 --> 09:28.040
Chike! He should be learning
new Robozuna moves!

09:28.120 --> 09:31.520
[Chandra] He's right.
You need more than insults to get results.

09:31.600 --> 09:34.320
Yeah? Says who... ooh?

09:34.400 --> 09:37.200
I'm Chandra, the coach for Team Vulpes.

09:37.560 --> 09:42.040
Uh... Uh... Ariston, this is Chike.

09:42.120 --> 09:44.560
Hey. I mean, hi. I mean... Uh...

09:44.640 --> 09:48.440
I hope your bots are better at playing
Robozuna than you are at talking.

09:52.640 --> 09:55.280
Wow! She looks just like Livia.

09:58.600 --> 10:00.720
Pfft! Not even close.

10:05.080 --> 10:08.480
Bad news.
Couldn't fix Spark in time for the match.

10:08.560 --> 10:11.520
Which means we're short
a Combatabot against Team Vulpes.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.680
Clunk and Mangle can handle it, can't you?

10:14.680 --> 10:17.800
You're like a drum. You're gonna get beat!

10:17.880 --> 10:19.120
Mm. Better.

10:19.200 --> 10:21.320
Hey, careful out there, okay?

10:22.200 --> 10:24.720
-[bleeping]
<i>-Ariston! This is Pierce.</i>

10:25.440 --> 10:26.920
It's one of Niven's drillers.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.360
[Pierce]
<i>A bounty hunter got to Niven. He--</i>

10:29.440 --> 10:31.800
-[static]
-Ah! We have to help Niven!

10:32.840 --> 10:35.200
If we leave, we forfeit the game

10:35.280 --> 10:37.640
and that, according to Corvus law,
is a crime.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.840
What if Chike and I stay here,
manage Spark and Clunk?

10:40.920 --> 10:42.760
You two and Mangle can save Niven.

10:42.840 --> 10:44.600
You just said Spark couldn't fight.

10:47.920 --> 10:49.160
We'll find a way.

10:51.040 --> 10:53.240
Come on, Mangle. Niven is in trouble.

10:53.800 --> 10:55.400
Trouble bad.

10:58.200 --> 11:01.640
All right! Let's rock and Robozuna!

11:22.400 --> 11:23.400
Let's go!

11:26.800 --> 11:27.640
Come on!

11:36.040 --> 11:37.640
Remember, this isn't a dream.

11:37.720 --> 11:41.560
It's real life and real life is dangerous,
so be careful.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.120
There's Niven!

11:46.600 --> 11:48.600
But what's that thing around him?

11:52.760 --> 11:55.120
You're a popular man, Mr. Lengil.

11:56.840 --> 11:58.240
Look out! Ah!

11:58.320 --> 11:59.320
Careful, fool!

12:00.520 --> 12:02.720
[both grunt]

12:02.800 --> 12:05.280
[grunting and groaning]

12:05.560 --> 12:07.280
Capture the others! I've got this.

12:09.440 --> 12:10.320
[grunts]

12:14.720 --> 12:19.560
Welcome to another exciting round
of Robozuna action.

12:19.640 --> 12:22.240
You can feel the tension in the air!

12:22.320 --> 12:25.920
Yeah, Slick, it reminds me
of my days in the arena.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.360
[grunts]
I'd give 'em a little bit of this.

12:28.440 --> 12:30.920
[whoops and grunts] And a lot of that!

12:31.000 --> 12:35.400
Hey! Yeah! Oh! And one of the... [yells]

12:35.480 --> 12:36.440
[groans]

12:37.720 --> 12:40.440
-And let's go down to the field!
-[cheering]

12:42.000 --> 12:45.880
Robo-Robozuna! It's game on!

12:45.960 --> 12:47.960
[buzzer]

12:49.600 --> 12:53.400
Pincer, remember, eyes on the thudball!

12:54.720 --> 12:56.000
You've got this, Clunk!

13:00.400 --> 13:03.120
Yes! Ha-ha! That's it!

13:03.200 --> 13:04.280
Now let's score!

13:07.840 --> 13:09.000
[grunts]

13:15.200 --> 13:18.880
Oh, yeah! Who's got
the best moves in the league?

13:21.680 --> 13:25.640
[mutters and grunts]

13:25.720 --> 13:27.920
Clunk! Grab the ball!

13:30.200 --> 13:32.280
Clunk! Time for trash talk!

13:32.360 --> 13:34.120
No! Not time!

13:34.200 --> 13:35.160
Definitely not!

13:35.960 --> 13:38.920
You're not a champ. You're a chump.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.480
You're not a player. You're a punk.

13:41.760 --> 13:43.520
[electronic whoop]

13:43.600 --> 13:47.040
You're not a winner.
You're a whiner. You're a...

13:47.120 --> 13:48.520
[grunts and groans]

13:49.960 --> 13:51.280
[hums]

13:55.760 --> 13:58.400
-[cheering]
-[Slick] That's round one!

13:58.480 --> 14:00.600
Team Vulpes is in the lead.

14:00.680 --> 14:02.000
[cheering]

14:03.440 --> 14:05.240
[electronic gibbering]

14:07.000 --> 14:10.160
Oh. Now I see why they call it trash talk,

14:10.240 --> 14:13.400
because, thanks to you,
poor Clunk's been trashed!

14:25.480 --> 14:26.800
Mangle protect!

14:41.720 --> 14:43.880
[sighs] Lanista was right.

14:45.840 --> 14:46.680
[grunts]

14:46.760 --> 14:49.800
You must be the rogues
from that Truth Ministry bulletin.

14:49.880 --> 14:52.520
I'll get quite a bonus
when Vermis arrives.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.200
We'll be long gone by then.

14:54.280 --> 14:55.480
I beg to differ.

14:55.560 --> 14:58.040
[grunting and groaning]

14:58.120 --> 15:00.320
[both grunt]

15:01.840 --> 15:04.840
Kilowatt, over here. Use the Snare!

15:04.920 --> 15:05.800
Ah!

15:08.560 --> 15:09.400
[pants]

15:09.480 --> 15:10.360
Look out!

15:11.400 --> 15:12.240
Ah!

15:13.080 --> 15:14.120
No!

15:14.760 --> 15:16.760
[grunting]

15:21.360 --> 15:22.400
And no!

15:28.840 --> 15:30.720
[grunting]

15:31.840 --> 15:33.160
[both grunt]

15:33.240 --> 15:35.760
-[crowd chant] Robozuna! Robozuna!
-[Slick] Woo-hoo-hoo!

15:35.840 --> 15:39.720
Spark has the thudball
and look at him go-go-go!

15:39.800 --> 15:42.360
Round two may be over
sooner than I thought!

15:42.440 --> 15:44.560
-Run, Spark!
-Run! Run! Run!

15:44.640 --> 15:45.760
[grunts]

15:46.360 --> 15:47.920
Brawler, now!

15:48.880 --> 15:52.040
The windmill spin-and-win!

15:53.360 --> 15:56.560
How's he going to defend himself?
His taser-fist is still busted!

15:56.640 --> 15:58.320
I came up with another idea.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.000
Just hope Spark remembers.

16:01.480 --> 16:03.840
[grunts]

16:03.920 --> 16:06.560
[groans]

16:06.640 --> 16:07.920
[electronic yell]

16:08.000 --> 16:12.200
Looks like Brawler's windmill spin-and-win
hit one of Burnum's underground pockets

16:12.280 --> 16:14.080
of natural gas!

16:14.560 --> 16:16.360
[electronic squealing]

16:18.280 --> 16:19.560
Spark remembered!

16:20.560 --> 16:22.360
[grunts] Yeah, Slick.

16:22.440 --> 16:26.920
You can stick a fork in Brawler,
'cause he's done! Well done!

16:27.000 --> 16:27.960
[grunts]

16:33.600 --> 16:35.800
[Slick] And with the game all tied up,

16:35.880 --> 16:38.520
-it's time for our final bout...
-[Spark] Who got the moves?

16:38.600 --> 16:44.400
...when two Combatabots from each team
determine who will be the winner!

16:44.480 --> 16:46.160
How we going to fight two-on-two?

16:46.840 --> 16:50.960
Spark barely won his match, and Clunk
is still rebooting from round one.

16:51.040 --> 16:53.960
Let's hope my dad and Ariston
get back here in time with Mangle.

16:54.040 --> 16:55.040
And if they don't?

16:58.080 --> 16:59.480
We'll work with what we got.

17:01.480 --> 17:04.400
[grunting]

17:04.480 --> 17:05.680
Why are you doing this?

17:06.360 --> 17:08.040
Look, it's not personal.

17:08.400 --> 17:09.800
I'm a bounty hunter.

17:09.880 --> 17:11.440
I catch outlaws.

17:11.520 --> 17:14.320
Corvus cheats and steals from the people.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.000
They're the real outlaws!

17:16.080 --> 17:17.240
That may be.

17:17.320 --> 17:21.800
And I suppose you think the proper thing
to do would be to let you go

17:21.880 --> 17:23.400
for the good of the cause!

17:24.280 --> 17:25.480
You're dreaming.

17:25.560 --> 17:26.520
[grunts]

17:28.560 --> 17:30.560
[grunting]

17:35.400 --> 17:37.120
Thought Bounty Bots tough.

17:37.920 --> 17:41.480
I know little baby crashbots tougher. Heh!

17:41.560 --> 17:43.760
[grunts angrily]

17:43.840 --> 17:46.200
You battle like an old rust bucket.

17:46.280 --> 17:49.440
[grunts angrily]

17:49.520 --> 17:51.640
What kind of bot talks like that?

17:55.440 --> 17:57.120
You might say he's one of a kind.

18:01.240 --> 18:03.880
[groans]

18:08.480 --> 18:10.360
Chike teach you that trash talk?

18:10.440 --> 18:13.240
Mangle teach self. Mangle smart.

18:16.880 --> 18:21.000
[Slick] Amazing! Round three has gone on
longer than I expected,

18:21.080 --> 18:23.000
but Spark has the thudball!

18:24.760 --> 18:25.600
[grunts]

18:26.480 --> 18:28.680
And with that amazing block by Clunk,

18:28.760 --> 18:31.520
it looks likes
Team Veredus just might score!

18:34.400 --> 18:36.400
We got Niven. He's safe.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.560
-So, are we going to win?
-Yep.

18:39.640 --> 18:41.760
See? We didn't even need you.

18:47.920 --> 18:49.120
Comin' at ya!

18:49.200 --> 18:52.240
Oh, no. Don't tell me. Trash talk?

18:52.320 --> 18:53.600
Listen up, metal head.

18:53.680 --> 18:54.760
[grunts angrily]

18:55.640 --> 18:57.200
I've seen paint...

18:58.160 --> 18:59.840
Dry faster than you move!

19:01.560 --> 19:02.800
[thud]

19:05.920 --> 19:10.760
Oh, Spark is down,
but he's not giving up that thudball!

19:10.840 --> 19:14.760
Too late. Crank's gearing up
for the old ratchet-comin-atcha move!

19:15.320 --> 19:16.560
[grunts]

19:21.640 --> 19:22.480
[grunts]

19:22.560 --> 19:28.160
[Slick] Score! Team Vulpes wins
round three and the game!

19:28.240 --> 19:29.720
Yeah!

19:29.800 --> 19:31.000
[groaning and sighing]

19:36.480 --> 19:41.920
Trash talk. Yeah, that'll work.
What was I thinking?

19:42.000 --> 19:44.240
[Chandra] Hey. Great match!

19:45.440 --> 19:46.760
You being sarcastic?

19:46.840 --> 19:49.040
No. You guys are good. I like you.

19:49.120 --> 19:50.800
I mean, I like your team.

19:50.880 --> 19:52.840
You're so rusty even a--

19:52.920 --> 19:54.840
Not now, Clunk. [chuckles nervously]

19:55.400 --> 19:57.400
See you at the next match, Chike.

20:01.280 --> 20:04.080
Uh, yeah. See you! Hm.

20:09.200 --> 20:12.800
Are you sure this is where
the bounty hunter told you to meet him?

20:12.880 --> 20:16.880
Are you suggesting
that I made a mistake, Sergeant?

20:17.240 --> 20:18.920
Of course not, Commander.

20:19.440 --> 20:22.480
Nevertheless, they're not here.

20:22.560 --> 20:24.360
What will you tell her highness?

20:25.120 --> 20:27.480
I'll deal with that when the time comes.

20:27.560 --> 20:28.760
[bleeping]

20:31.000 --> 20:33.360
Hm. I think it just did.

20:34.040 --> 20:35.200
[sighs]

20:42.200 --> 20:43.440
[Lanista] You're up late.

20:43.840 --> 20:46.200
[sighs] Couldn't sleep.

20:47.080 --> 20:50.040
My dream turned out to be a nightmare.

20:50.120 --> 20:50.960
How so?

20:51.040 --> 20:52.200
You could've been hurt.

20:52.280 --> 20:54.040
Mangle could've been hurt!

20:54.120 --> 20:57.080
Now Niven's on the run
and we lost the game.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.200
The game isn't important.

20:59.280 --> 21:01.280
But I thought you said...

21:03.080 --> 21:06.640
The thing that separates us from
the other side is the choices we make.

21:06.720 --> 21:08.120
That is what matters.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.400
I'm not following you.

21:10.480 --> 21:13.920
[chuckles] We could've left Illex
and his bot tied up for Vermis to find,

21:14.000 --> 21:15.040
but we didn't.

21:15.120 --> 21:18.280
We let them go
because it was the right thing to do.

21:18.800 --> 21:22.200
And you were right about your dream.
Maybe it could come true.

21:24.280 --> 21:25.600
You think so?

21:25.680 --> 21:26.680
I do now.

21:27.400 --> 21:30.720
Guess Mangle isn't the only one
who's learning.

21:30.800 --> 21:34.600
Yes. Dream... good.
