01:42.869 --> 01:46.372
The Secretary of State for War has
today received the following dispatch

01:46.456 --> 01:47.748
from Lord Chelmsford,

01:47.874 --> 01:53.379
Commander in Chief of Her Majesty's
forces in Natal colony, South Africa.

01:53.463 --> 01:55.965
"I regret to report
a very disastrous engagement

01:56.049 --> 01:58.842
"which took place on the morning
of the 22nd January

01:58.927 --> 02:02.012
"between the armies of
the Zulu king Cetshwayo

02:02.097 --> 02:05.307
"and our own Number 3 Column,
consisting of Five Companies

02:05.392 --> 02:08.268
"of the 1 st Battalion,
24th Regiment of Foot,

02:08.353 --> 02:10.520
"and one company of the 2nd Battalion,

02:10.604 --> 02:16.860
"a total of nearly 1,500 men,
officers and other ranks.

02:16.945 --> 02:21.115
"The Zulus, in overwhelming numbers,
launched a highly disciplined attack

02:21.199 --> 02:24.076
"on the slopes of the mountain
of Isandhlwana,

02:24.160 --> 02:25.869
"and in spite of gallant resistance..."

05:31.431 --> 05:34.099
What did he ask, Father?

05:34.225 --> 05:36.852
Whether a man of God like myself
was pleased

05:36.936 --> 05:42.441
to see so many warriors married
to so many maidens at one time.

05:42.567 --> 05:45.277
How can he imagine
it would please anyone?

05:45.403 --> 05:48.280
Do you think I said it pleased me,
daughter?

05:48.364 --> 05:51.617
I told him I was unhappy
to see so many brides

05:51.701 --> 05:53.911
who may soon become widows.

05:55.872 --> 05:58.540
That was a very good answer, Father.

08:06.210 --> 08:09.880
Why do they have those little spears?
The girls, I mean?

08:12.175 --> 08:16.178
It's a symbol of their chastity, daughter.

08:39.118 --> 08:44.498
It's splendid, I know,
but it's quite horrible too, isn't it?

08:45.625 --> 08:50.170
The Book says, "What went ye out
into the wilderness to see?

08:50.254 --> 08:53.590
- "A man clothed in soft raiment?"
- Yes, Father.

09:36.175 --> 09:37.676
You must understand these things

09:37.760 --> 09:39.886
if you're going to stay in Africa,
Margareta.

09:40.012 --> 09:41.930
That's why I brought you here.

09:42.014 --> 09:44.975
They are a great people, daughter.

09:45.059 --> 09:49.187
But how can they let themselves
be married in droves like this?

09:50.106 --> 09:53.900
Young girls to old men.

09:54.026 --> 09:59.114
In Europe, young women accept
arranged marriages with rich men.

09:59.198 --> 10:03.243
Perhaps the Zulu girls are luckier
getting a brave man.

11:09.018 --> 11:10.393
Margareta.

11:12.688 --> 11:13.980
Wait.

11:14.732 --> 11:16.858
- All right.
- Father!

11:16.943 --> 11:18.860
Wait. Wait, Margareta.

11:31.624 --> 11:35.085
- Dear Lord in Heaven!
- What is it? Father?

11:35.169 --> 11:38.004
One thousand British soldiers
have been massacred.

11:38.089 --> 11:41.591
While I stood here talking peace,
a war has started.

11:42.009 --> 11:46.429
Ishiwan! Ishiwan!

11:46.514 --> 11:49.015
Ishiwan? Didn't you say that Ishiwan...

11:49.100 --> 11:53.478
Yes. It's their name for
our mission station at Rorke's Drift.

11:53.563 --> 11:56.398
- They're going to destroy it.
- Why?

11:56.482 --> 11:58.775
Because there are British soldiers
at Rorke's Drift.

11:58.859 --> 12:01.236
- But it's only a handful.
- Come.

12:03.114 --> 12:07.576
- It is a hospital. Father, tell him.
- Do you think he will listen?

12:07.660 --> 12:10.954
We must get there.
There'll be a massacre.

12:20.756 --> 12:23.341
Father! Father!

13:18.648 --> 13:21.858
- All right, Corporal Allen.
- Sir. Corp? Let go.

14:39.603 --> 14:41.604
Right turn.

14:43.774 --> 14:45.483
Quick march.

15:00.249 --> 15:04.794
Colour Sergeant Bourne,
what's that shooting?

15:04.879 --> 15:06.629
A rifle, Hughes.

15:07.882 --> 15:11.593
If you're sick in hospital,
I suggest you go and lie down.

15:11.677 --> 15:13.636
Yes, Colour Sergeant.

15:23.147 --> 15:26.149
Hey, Hookie,
who's doing all that shooting?

15:27.443 --> 15:29.944
- Who do you think?
- Who do you think?

15:30.029 --> 15:32.363
Mr Flaming Bromhead is shooting
flaming defenceless animals

15:32.448 --> 15:33.990
for the flaming officers' flaming dinner.

16:07.942 --> 16:10.693
I wish he'd bring us some fresh meat.

16:12.196 --> 16:14.113
I wonder what they're cooking
for supper.

16:14.198 --> 16:17.575
Same as usual.
Horse meat and axle grease.

16:22.164 --> 16:24.499
Which one has got the bullet?

16:24.875 --> 16:29.838
She was as beautiful as a butterfly.

16:30.381 --> 16:34.342
She was as beautiful as a buttertly

16:34.426 --> 16:37.011
and as proud as a queen

16:37.763 --> 16:42.267
Was pretty little Polly Perkins
of Paddington Green

16:42.351 --> 16:43.476
Shut up, you cripple!

16:43.561 --> 16:47.480
She was as beautiful as a buttertly
and as...

16:52.486 --> 16:54.445
Come on, make your mind up.

16:54.530 --> 16:55.905
It's turning blue.

16:55.990 --> 16:58.575
Yeah, yeah, very pretty, lovely.
Which one?

16:59.660 --> 17:01.536
It's under that one.

17:02.830 --> 17:07.584
The boy's clever. The boy's good.
How about putting some money on?

17:07.667 --> 17:09.085
Five rounds!

17:09.795 --> 17:11.713
Independent! Fire!

17:11.797 --> 17:13.882
Stuff me with green apples.

17:13.965 --> 17:16.885
You know, if a dog was as sick as him,
they'd shoot him.

17:16.969 --> 17:19.304
Five rounds! Independent!

17:20.138 --> 17:21.347
Fire!

17:22.057 --> 17:24.349
Shut up, you rotten, sick...

17:24.768 --> 17:27.145
Why don't you leave him alone?

17:30.441 --> 17:32.483
He's sick enough. You'll kill him!

17:32.568 --> 17:34.527
Wouldn't bother Hookie,
would it, Hookie?

17:34.612 --> 17:37.155
Wouldn't bother, Hookie,
it wouldn't matter if Maxfield was dead.

17:37.239 --> 17:40.825
I don't care if you were all dead. Blimey!

17:42.036 --> 17:45.872
Rorke's Drift.
It'd take an Irishman to give his name

17:45.956 --> 17:49.584
to a rotten, stinking
middle-of-nowhere hole like this.

18:18.906 --> 18:20.448
Hold that pont!

18:22.743 --> 18:24.911
- Corporal Allen?
- Sir?

18:27.998 --> 18:30.667
- Get some men in the water!
- Sir.

18:37.174 --> 18:38.257
Hey!

18:38.342 --> 18:41.928
You heard that Officer of Engineers.
Get it.

19:01.907 --> 19:05.618
Heave! Put a bit more weight
on that rope, you men.

19:06.495 --> 19:09.163
- He's even got a voice like a corporal.
- Yeah.

19:09.248 --> 19:12.834
Sort of like a female hippopotamus
in labour.

19:42.614 --> 19:46.325
- Hot work?
- Damned hot work.

19:47.536 --> 19:50.621
Still, the river cools you off
a bit, though?

19:52.624 --> 19:56.294
- Who are you?
- John Chard. Royal Engineers.

19:57.212 --> 19:59.797
Bromhead. 24th.

20:00.632 --> 20:03.009
That's my post, up there.

20:05.012 --> 20:06.846
You've come down from the column?

20:06.972 --> 20:09.807
That's right.
They want a bridge across the river.

20:11.852 --> 20:14.187
Who said you could use my men?

20:15.689 --> 20:18.733
They were sitting around
on their backsides doing nothing.

20:20.152 --> 20:22.528
Rather you asked first, old boy.

20:23.739 --> 20:26.532
I was told their officer was out hunting.

20:28.994 --> 20:30.161
Yes.

20:36.877 --> 20:39.504
I'll tell my man to clean your kit.

20:40.339 --> 20:43.299
- Don't bother.
- No bother.

20:43.383 --> 20:45.551
I'm not offering to clean it myself.

20:45.677 --> 20:49.138
Still, a chap ought to look smart
in front of the men.

20:49.223 --> 20:50.890
Don't you think?

20:51.517 --> 20:55.186
Well, chin-chin.
Do carry on with your mud pies.

21:09.535 --> 21:10.701
You.

21:11.537 --> 21:13.621
- What's your name?
- Owen.

21:15.874 --> 21:16.999
Sir.

21:17.376 --> 21:20.211
- Are you supposed to be here?
- Yes, sir.

21:20.879 --> 21:27.176
Well, not exactly. You see, sir,
only, you've got my solo tenor out there.

21:29.346 --> 21:32.390
- I've got your what?
- 612 Williams, sir.

21:32.891 --> 21:35.643
We were going to practise this
afternoon with the company choir.

21:35.727 --> 21:40.189
But you've got my only solo tenor
working out there in the cold water.

21:41.400 --> 21:44.318
Well, I hope he sings better
than he works.

21:45.320 --> 21:47.405
Oh, indeed, sir. He does.

21:52.744 --> 21:56.873
Every piece of wood in this
blistering country's eaten by ants.

21:57.332 --> 22:01.169
The heat and the dust, sir.
Very nasty on the larynx.

22:04.173 --> 22:06.841
Mr Bromhead lets you have a choir,
does he?

22:06.925 --> 22:09.427
Well, every Welsh regiment
has a choir, sir.

22:09.553 --> 22:13.264
Mr Bromhead is English,
but he is a proper gentleman.

22:14.433 --> 22:16.559
There's no doubt of that.

22:17.519 --> 22:21.439
- And what do you sing?
- Me, sir? Baritone, sir.

22:22.191 --> 22:23.399
Good.

22:24.443 --> 22:27.778
I can find work for baritones
as well as tenors.

22:38.582 --> 22:41.542
See what you make of that, over there,
below the escarpment.

22:41.627 --> 22:45.421
- Two riders.
- Gallopers from the column, sir?

22:46.757 --> 22:49.884
Very wonderful things, these, sir,
aren't they?

22:58.143 --> 23:00.228
- Corporal Allen?
- Sir?

23:00.312 --> 23:03.064
- Get your party ashore at the double.
- Sir.

23:03.148 --> 23:05.149
All right, you heard
that Officer of Engineers.

23:05.275 --> 23:08.152
Make fast and back to the bank. Move.

23:09.780 --> 23:11.447
Come on, lad. Hop on it.

23:27.422 --> 23:30.508
- Trouble, sir?
- Could be.

23:30.592 --> 23:33.261
I can anchor the ponts midstream, sir.
With six riflemen I could...

23:33.345 --> 23:36.347
This is a situation you think an Engineer
Officer can't handle, Corporal?

23:36.431 --> 23:39.183
- No, sir. Beg your pardon, sir.
- Fall them in.

23:39.268 --> 23:41.811
We ain't finished the bridge, sir.

23:42.271 --> 23:44.855
- Fall them in, Corporal.
- Sir.

23:51.363 --> 23:56.158
Get fell in, you men. Squad.
Squad, 'shun.

23:56.785 --> 23:58.369
Left turn.

23:59.288 --> 24:02.039
Left wheel. By the left. Quick march.

24:03.333 --> 24:05.042
Left, left.

24:06.795 --> 24:11.716
Left, left, left, right, left. Left, left.

24:32.487 --> 24:35.406
Hey! Hey, you!
What's going on down there?

24:37.492 --> 24:39.076
They're building barricades
or something.

24:39.202 --> 24:40.661
What's that?

24:47.753 --> 24:51.422
Ride like hell.
Tell them they can't get here too soon.

24:54.885 --> 24:55.926
- Corporal.
- Sir.

24:56.053 --> 24:58.721
I want all these people out of here.

24:59.222 --> 25:00.931
Douse these cooking fires
and turn the boilers over.

25:01.016 --> 25:03.351
- But they've got soup in them, sir.
- Pour it on the fires.

25:03.435 --> 25:06.020
- And get yourself a rifle.
- A rifle, sir? But I don't...

25:06.104 --> 25:09.273
Mr Chard? Mr Chard?

25:09.775 --> 25:12.276
- Commissary Dalton, is it?
- That is correct.

25:12.361 --> 25:14.528
But Mr Chard,
you've just asked this man...

25:14.613 --> 25:17.365
To pour the soup on the fires.
See that he does it.

25:17.449 --> 25:19.825
All these bags of maize
inside the perimeter.

25:19.910 --> 25:23.037
And I don't want these tents
providing cover for the enemy.

25:23.121 --> 25:24.997
Does he know what it's like
to make soup for 100 men

25:25.082 --> 25:27.208
in this flaming heat, Mr Dalton,
does he, sir?

25:27.292 --> 25:30.628
Oh, now, don't distress yourself,
my dear fellow.

25:30.712 --> 25:32.671
There's your own officer over there.

25:32.756 --> 25:35.216
- You go and speak with him.
- Yes, sir.

25:37.052 --> 25:38.219
Chard?

25:42.307 --> 25:46.143
This is Adendorff, Natal Native
Contingent from Isandhlwana.

25:46.645 --> 25:48.604
Bromhead, 24th Foot.

25:49.481 --> 25:51.482
You've come from there?

25:53.276 --> 25:56.904
All right, man, is it true?

25:56.988 --> 26:00.449
Beg your pardon, sir.
About the soup, sir.

26:03.829 --> 26:06.497
- What about the soup?
- Well, this gentleman, sir,

26:06.581 --> 26:08.791
said to put it on the fire.

26:10.168 --> 26:11.585
He did?

26:11.670 --> 26:13.754
We have thatched roofs here,
Bromhead.

26:13.839 --> 26:16.841
No need to make the Zulus
a present of fire.

26:18.468 --> 26:19.677
Yes.

26:20.846 --> 26:22.763
Then get on with it.

26:22.848 --> 26:26.851
- There's a good fellow.
- Well, am I to take a rifle, too, sir?

26:27.769 --> 26:29.520
The entire column.

26:31.440 --> 26:34.775
- It's damned impossible. 800 men?
- 1,200 men.

26:34.860 --> 26:37.528
There were 400 native levies also.

26:37.612 --> 26:40.531
Damn the levies, man.
More cowardly blacks.

26:42.659 --> 26:44.702
What the hell do you mean,
cowardly blacks?

26:44.786 --> 26:46.954
They died on your side, didn't they?

26:47.038 --> 26:50.124
And who the hell do you think is coming
to wipe out your little command,

26:50.208 --> 26:52.168
the Grenadier Guards?

26:55.046 --> 26:57.506
What the deuce is the matter with him?

26:58.133 --> 27:03.888
- Adendorff? Are you staying?
- Is there anywhere else to go?

27:04.014 --> 27:08.058
Talk to our levies, will you?
Tell them whose side they're on.

27:23.408 --> 27:24.742
Did the runner bring orders?

27:24.868 --> 27:28.078
He brought orders
to the commander of this post.

27:28.914 --> 27:31.874
- To do what?
- To hold our ground.

27:35.086 --> 27:36.921
To hold our ground?

27:41.259 --> 27:43.719
What military genius
thought up that one?

27:44.387 --> 27:46.388
Somebody's son and heir

27:47.098 --> 27:50.059
who got a commission
before he learnt to shave?

27:51.102 --> 27:54.563
I rather fancy
that he's nobody's son and heir now.

28:13.959 --> 28:16.168
- Who are they?
- The Witts.

28:16.294 --> 28:19.380
- Witts?
- The Swedish missionaries here.

28:19.464 --> 28:21.465
This is their station.

28:25.011 --> 28:28.639
They've chosen a damned odd time
for a prayer meeting.

28:48.118 --> 28:50.995
I think you better get them out of here.

28:51.121 --> 28:53.664
Are you giving me an order, old boy?

28:55.000 --> 28:56.333
Bromhead?

29:00.839 --> 29:04.550
Let's get one thing clear.
I'm no line officer. I'm an engineer.

29:04.676 --> 29:08.178
- I came here to build a bridge.
- Jolly lucky for you.

29:08.305 --> 29:09.930
I mean, otherwise,
you would've been chopped

29:10.015 --> 29:12.683
with the rest of the column,
wouldn't you?

29:14.185 --> 29:15.561
All right.

29:16.229 --> 29:18.856
What's the date of your commission?

29:20.483 --> 29:25.362
Now don't tell me.
I suppose you have seniority.

29:25.488 --> 29:28.032
1872. May.

29:29.868 --> 29:32.911
1872. February.

29:33.997 --> 29:38.250
Oh, well. I suppose there are such
things as gifted amateurs. If I may...

29:38.376 --> 29:40.085
Are you questioning my right
to command?

29:40.211 --> 29:43.547
Oh, not your right, old boy. Never mind.

29:44.674 --> 29:49.428
We can cooperate, as they say.

29:54.726 --> 29:57.394
- I'll be here, won't I?
- Bromhead?

30:04.235 --> 30:07.780
Have you been here long enough
to put a lookout on that hill?

30:10.742 --> 30:13.243
Not since we've been chatting, no.

30:19.084 --> 30:21.627
I've started the barricades, though.

30:22.921 --> 30:25.214
I managed to think of that.

30:25.298 --> 30:27.883
Who's the sergeant with the muscles?

30:27.967 --> 30:30.761
Sgt Windridge. Good man.

30:35.767 --> 30:36.892
Not you again?

30:36.976 --> 30:39.937
Yes, sir, Surgeon Reynolds.
It's me arm, sir.

30:40.063 --> 30:42.606
The only trouble with your arm
is you never do any work with it.

30:42.732 --> 30:44.817
Pretty terrible pain, sir.

30:45.777 --> 30:48.404
All right. Off with your vest.

30:49.531 --> 30:51.448
- Now, sir?
- Now, sir.

30:53.159 --> 30:54.451
Yes, sir.

30:58.540 --> 31:00.624
It's cruel to bend, sir.

31:02.544 --> 31:05.504
You know what you've got there,
my malingering Hector?

31:05.630 --> 31:08.674
No, sir. Hook's the name, sir.

31:08.800 --> 31:11.385
You've got a fine, handsome boil,
my friend.

31:11.469 --> 31:15.097
There's one glistening boil
for every soldier in Africa.

31:15.181 --> 31:18.225
You may not win many medals
on this campaign, Hook,

31:18.309 --> 31:20.352
but you'll certainly get more boils.

31:20.478 --> 31:24.606
For every gunshot wound I probe,
I expect to lance three boils.

31:24.691 --> 31:26.942
Spot of medicinal brandy
would set me up, sir.

31:27.026 --> 31:29.361
Brandy's for heroes, Mr Hook.

31:29.487 --> 31:31.572
The rest of you will make do with boils
in your skin,

31:31.656 --> 31:34.992
flies in your meat
and dysentery in your bellies.

31:35.744 --> 31:39.538
Now, then, this is going to hurt you
a lot more than it will me,

31:39.664 --> 31:41.373
I'm happy to say.

31:46.921 --> 31:51.925
Mr Bromhead? Cetshwayo is coming
with two impis to destroy you.

31:52.010 --> 31:57.514
You must talk to Lt Chard, Mr Witt.
He commands here. Margareta.

31:57.599 --> 32:00.893
Mr Chard, I am ready to take away
your sick and wounded.

32:01.019 --> 32:04.480
Please supply the wagons. Daughter,
tell the men in the hospital to get ready.

32:04.564 --> 32:07.232
One moment, Miss Margareta. Mr Witt?

32:09.027 --> 32:11.945
I don't suppose
you hold the Queen's Commission?

32:12.030 --> 32:14.281
I am a man of peace, sir.

32:14.365 --> 32:18.035
Then allow a Queen's officer
to give orders to her soldiers.

32:18.119 --> 32:21.997
Now, how do you know
what Cetshwayo is doing?

32:22.081 --> 32:26.376
We have just come from his kraal, sir.
He's a member of my parish.

32:28.046 --> 32:32.716
Your parish? Are you sure you're on
the right side of the river, Mr Witt?

32:34.385 --> 32:37.888
I am here to do my duty.
I expect your cooperation.

32:40.225 --> 32:42.142
What's our strength?

32:42.227 --> 32:45.771
Seven officers, including surgeon,
commissaries and so on.

32:45.897 --> 32:50.484
Oh, and Adendorff now, I suppose.
Wounded and sick, 36.

32:50.568 --> 32:55.239
Fit for duty, 97.
And about 40 native levies.

32:55.740 --> 32:57.699
Not much of an army for you.

32:57.784 --> 33:00.869
There are 4,000 Zulus
coming against you.

33:00.954 --> 33:03.288
You must abandon this mission.

33:04.290 --> 33:05.582
Mr Chard?

33:07.919 --> 33:10.337
Adendorff sent his trooper
to Helpmekaar.

33:10.421 --> 33:12.172
There's a relief column there,
isn't there? A cavalry?

33:12.257 --> 33:14.341
There was three days ago.

33:17.136 --> 33:21.557
Mr Bromhead, issue all our walking
wounded with arms and ammunition.

33:21.641 --> 33:24.309
You will all be killed like those
this morning.

33:24.435 --> 33:27.521
And now the sick in their beds.
All of you.

33:27.605 --> 33:29.606
I don't think so, Mr Witt.

33:29.691 --> 33:32.150
The army doesn't like
more than one disaster in a day.

33:32.277 --> 33:36.780
It looks bad in the newspapers and
upsets civilians at their breakfast.

33:38.283 --> 33:40.659
Sir, the Book says,

33:40.785 --> 33:45.080
"There is no king that can be saved
by the multitude of a host,

33:45.164 --> 33:46.540
"neither is any man..."

33:46.624 --> 33:47.958
Mr Witt?

33:49.043 --> 33:53.338
When I have the impertinence to climb
into your pulpit and deliver a sermon,

33:53.464 --> 33:54.673
then you may tell me my duty.

33:54.799 --> 33:57.926
It is not your duty to sacrifice the sick.

33:58.011 --> 34:00.596
Are you a student of tactics too,
Miss Witt?

34:00.680 --> 34:02.556
Are you a Christian?

34:04.309 --> 34:05.309
Sgt Windridge?

34:05.393 --> 34:07.603
It is your duty to let us
take those men away.

34:07.687 --> 34:09.813
Not that way, Miss Witt.

34:10.315 --> 34:12.190
- Sir.
- Come, daughter.

34:18.322 --> 34:23.159
Sergeant, put two good men on that hill
and tell them to keep their eyes peeled.

34:23.244 --> 34:25.704
- Mr Bromhead, sir?
- Double up, damn it!

34:25.830 --> 34:28.331
Carry on, Sgt Windridge,
there's a good fellow.

34:28.416 --> 34:29.875
Sir.

34:30.001 --> 34:31.793
- Colour Sergeant Bourne?
- Sir.

34:31.878 --> 34:33.337
Mr Bromhead?

34:35.840 --> 34:39.842
You know, I had a calf like you once,
back home in Merioneth.

34:41.137 --> 34:44.222
I'll get you some milk.
I'll make you strong.

34:45.224 --> 34:47.351
Would you like that, then?

34:49.687 --> 34:53.523
What the hell do you think you're doing
at a time like this? Shut up!

35:03.868 --> 35:05.202
Owen!

35:05.787 --> 35:07.621
Yes, Sergeant?

35:07.705 --> 35:10.415
- You've got a voice, haven't you?
- Yes, baritone, Sergeant.

35:10.500 --> 35:14.336
Well, get up on that hill
and sing out if you see anything.

35:15.505 --> 35:16.797
You, too.

35:18.174 --> 35:21.551
And take your bandook,
you dozy Welshman!

35:31.938 --> 35:36.775
The classical attack of the Zulus
is in the shape of a bull buffelo like this.

35:36.859 --> 35:41.321
The head, the horns and the loins.

35:41.864 --> 35:46.451
First, the head moves forward and the
enemy naturally moves in to meet it,

35:46.536 --> 35:48.328
but it's only a feint.

35:48.413 --> 35:52.207
The warriors in the head then disperse
to form the encircling horns

35:52.291 --> 35:55.085
and the enemy is drawn in on the loins.

35:55.169 --> 35:58.296
And the horns close in
on the back and sides.

36:01.551 --> 36:02.801
Finish.

36:06.472 --> 36:09.766
It looks jolly simple, doesn't it?

36:09.851 --> 36:13.061
Though it's jolly deadly, old boy.

36:14.981 --> 36:18.025
Well done, Adendorff.
We'll make an Englishman of you yet.

36:18.109 --> 36:20.569
No, thanks. I'm a Boer.

36:20.653 --> 36:24.781
The Zulus are the enemies of my blood.
What are you doing here?

36:24.866 --> 36:27.534
You don't object to our help, I hope?

36:27.994 --> 36:31.038
It all depends what you damned English
want for it afterwards.

36:31.122 --> 36:34.583
All right. Hospital. Church.

36:35.168 --> 36:37.127
Cattle kraal. Stables.

36:37.211 --> 36:41.006
An outside perimeter
joining the buildings here and here.

36:41.924 --> 36:44.968
Now, we don't move out to meet
the feint of the buffelo head.

36:45.053 --> 36:46.094
We hold the outside perimeter.

36:46.179 --> 36:51.641
If and when that collapses,
we move back into this area here.

36:52.143 --> 36:54.102
How high can you build a wall there,
Bromhead?

36:54.187 --> 36:56.354
Well, it should be about shoulder high.

36:56.439 --> 36:59.066
But if the fuzzies moved out
of Isandhlwana immediately,

36:59.150 --> 37:01.735
they could be here, well, now.

37:02.361 --> 37:04.529
It's just a matter of time.

37:09.744 --> 37:11.203
Now, we'll have to make the time.

37:15.458 --> 37:19.002
You mean your only plan is to stand
behind a few feet of mealie bags,

37:19.087 --> 37:21.171
and wait for the attack?

37:22.757 --> 37:25.634
That's right. We wait.

37:25.718 --> 37:29.596
If 1,200 men couldn't hold
a defensive position this morning,

37:29.680 --> 37:32.015
what chance have we with 100?

37:35.770 --> 37:38.688
Listen, old boy,
I'll take the company up into the hills.

37:38.773 --> 37:41.024
I know exactly how to disperse them.

37:42.276 --> 37:46.196
Ambush, you see?
We cut them down in the passes.

37:46.280 --> 37:49.407
Bromhead?
I want that line of boxes across here,

37:49.492 --> 37:52.619
from the cattle kraal
to the outside perimeter.

37:53.621 --> 37:57.040
And if they get over this, redoubt.

38:06.008 --> 38:07.509
And a final redoubt here.

38:29.824 --> 38:31.658
That, put it in the middle.

38:31.742 --> 38:33.869
What are you doing in here?

38:35.079 --> 38:39.416
This is a church!
Don't you realise, this is an altar table?

38:39.500 --> 38:42.043
I'm sorry. There's nothing larger.
We need it now.

38:42.128 --> 38:44.254
And there's no chloroform.

38:44.338 --> 38:47.799
Go to the hospital.
Tell the sick to be ready to leave.

38:47.884 --> 38:52.387
I want water, cold water, lots of it,
a probe, a saw, some nitric acid.

38:53.598 --> 38:56.433
Don't take it too badly, Mr Witt.

38:56.517 --> 39:00.896
Isn't this as good a place as any
for a man to be when he's in pain?

39:56.452 --> 40:00.080
Excuse me, sir.
Tuck your heads in afore they fall off.

40:00.164 --> 40:04.084
Sorry, sir. I have orders
to get some of these bags outside.

40:04.669 --> 40:06.795
All right, get on with it.

40:07.171 --> 40:10.924
I was praying that your officer
may turn to God's word.

40:11.008 --> 40:15.512
That's right, sir. A prayer's as good
as a bayonet on a day like this.

40:16.013 --> 40:19.349
- Have you prayed?
- There'll be a time for it, sir.

40:20.017 --> 40:21.810
What will you say?

40:23.354 --> 40:26.273
Pick it up.
Bit of the Psalms, I suppose, sir.

40:27.275 --> 40:31.486
My father was a lay preacher.
A great one for the Psalms, he was.

40:32.154 --> 40:36.366
There was one that might have been
written for a soldier.

40:36.993 --> 40:40.620
Say it, man. Lift your voice to God.

40:41.205 --> 40:44.708
- Now, sir?
- Yes. Let them hear your voice.

40:44.792 --> 40:46.293
They know my voice
when they hear it, sir.

40:46.377 --> 40:48.461
Let them hear it now
in praise of the Lord.

40:48.546 --> 40:52.882
Call upon him.
Call upon him, man, for your salvation.

40:54.802 --> 40:58.972
Well, as far as I can remember, sir,
it goes something like this.

40:59.890 --> 41:03.143
"He maketh wars to cease
in all the world,

41:03.227 --> 41:07.480
"he breaketh the bow
and snappeth the spear in sunder."

41:08.733 --> 41:10.150
Do you know it, sir?

41:10.234 --> 41:12.569
"I shall be exalted among the heathen,

41:12.695 --> 41:16.990
"I shall be exalted in the earth.
The Lord of hosts is with us."

41:17.074 --> 41:18.658
That's it, sir.

41:26.917 --> 41:29.169
All right.
Nobody told you to stop working.

41:29.253 --> 41:31.921
You lead-backsided. Get sweating.

41:35.593 --> 41:39.596
I've been sitting there thinking.
I've got it all sorted out.

41:40.598 --> 41:41.890
Company!

41:47.355 --> 41:49.689
What are you doing here, Miss?

41:52.568 --> 41:55.945
He doesn't need any help.
I'll look after him.

41:58.866 --> 42:00.116
Won't I?

42:04.580 --> 42:07.540
You are all to be evacuated soon
in the wagons.

42:07.625 --> 42:09.542
- Who says?
- My father.

42:10.628 --> 42:13.713
That's nice, isn't it? Your father.

42:15.091 --> 42:18.551
You and me, Hookie.
Mr Chard's orders. In this room.

42:21.097 --> 42:22.555
Here we are.

42:28.896 --> 42:32.774
Hey, what are you talking about?
I'm sick. I'm excused duty.

42:33.442 --> 42:35.235
What are you doing?

42:36.153 --> 42:38.405
I'm making a loophole, see?

42:38.489 --> 42:41.324
Me and Hookie's gonna fight in here.
Aren't we, Hookie?

42:41.450 --> 42:43.326
You're joking! I'm sick.

42:43.411 --> 42:46.913
Nobody's got any right to ask me
to muck around in a flaming battle.

42:46.997 --> 42:48.331
I'm getting out.

42:48.457 --> 42:50.291
- Private Hook!
- Yes?

42:52.461 --> 42:54.003
Yes, Sergeant.

42:59.844 --> 43:01.761
I know you, Hook.

43:01.846 --> 43:03.680
Yeah, you ought to.

43:04.181 --> 43:06.015
You're no good, Hook.

43:09.812 --> 43:13.481
They gave us you
because you are no good to anyone

43:13.566 --> 43:16.192
except the Queen and Sgt Maxfield.

43:17.528 --> 43:20.196
Thank you very much, the both of you.

43:24.577 --> 43:27.871
Take this rifle, Hook, and get to it!

43:28.998 --> 43:31.374
I'll make a soldier of you yet.

43:45.681 --> 43:50.518
And what for? Did I ever see a Zulu
walk down the City Road? No!

43:50.603 --> 43:52.896
So what am I doing here?

43:53.022 --> 43:55.940
- You are here because you were a thief.
- Yeah.

43:56.066 --> 43:58.443
- And you still are one...
- Certainly.

43:58.569 --> 44:00.236
...Hook, my lad.

44:02.239 --> 44:06.784
And now, you can be a soldier,
like what they pay you for.

44:07.536 --> 44:11.748
Look, you got me 28 days'
field punishment in Brecon.

44:11.874 --> 44:13.458
Isn't that enough?

44:15.794 --> 44:18.588
Pick up the bayonet and help Williams.

44:25.429 --> 44:27.430
And put your tunic on!

45:10.266 --> 45:12.809
28 days' field punishment. No pay.

45:14.144 --> 45:17.689
You know what he did?
Sent money to my missus.

45:19.275 --> 45:21.317
What did you do that for?

45:22.319 --> 45:24.153
You hate him for it?

45:24.446 --> 45:27.240
What do you want me to do?
Cry me heart out?

45:27.324 --> 45:29.200
Give him a big kiss?

45:37.793 --> 45:40.295
I thought you might pray for him.

45:42.631 --> 45:44.966
Oh, she's a dry one. Very cool.

45:47.720 --> 45:49.804
You know what she needs.

45:50.222 --> 45:53.182
Play your cards right,
and it could be you.

46:04.695 --> 46:06.362
Can I help anyone?

46:08.073 --> 46:11.034
There will be wagons soon
to take you away.

46:12.494 --> 46:15.121
He's dying. There's nothing you can do.

46:15.205 --> 46:16.497
Nothing?

46:18.208 --> 46:20.043
There must be.

46:21.045 --> 46:23.254
- 'Shun!
- Now pay attention.

46:24.715 --> 46:27.634
Is there any walking sick without rifles?

46:28.552 --> 46:29.636
Me.

46:30.971 --> 46:34.140
You, Dutchy?
You couldn't walk to the latrine.

46:34.224 --> 46:36.768
This is not my first action. Come on.

46:36.894 --> 46:39.479
Are you expecting sick men to fight?

46:52.409 --> 46:54.786
What's he going to do, 593?

46:54.912 --> 46:57.664
Oh, I think he wants to be a hero, 716.

46:58.582 --> 47:01.959
Haven't you red necks got names
instead of numbers?

47:02.086 --> 47:04.003
This is a Welsh regiment, man.

47:04.088 --> 47:07.006
Though there are some foreigners
from England in it, mind.

47:07.091 --> 47:11.427
I am Jones from Bwlchgwyn.
He is Jones from Builth Wells.

47:12.096 --> 47:14.847
There are four more Joneses
in C Company.

47:14.932 --> 47:17.266
Confusing, isn't it, Dutchy?

47:21.647 --> 47:23.648
What's your name, then?

47:24.108 --> 47:27.777
It's Schiess. And I'm not Dutch.
I'm Swiss.

47:28.362 --> 47:32.448
Well, there's a silly man, by damn.
He's got himself into a private war.

47:32.950 --> 47:35.451
I belong to Natal Mounted Police.

47:36.286 --> 47:41.290
Is that true, then? He's a peeler, 716.
Come to arrest the Zulus.

47:41.834 --> 47:44.127
What do you know about Zulus?

47:44.211 --> 47:46.379
Bunch of savages, isn't it?

47:50.551 --> 47:53.970
All right, how far can you red necks
march in a day?

47:54.054 --> 47:56.305
Oh, 15, 20 miles, is it?

47:56.390 --> 48:01.227
A Zulu regiment can run, run, 50 miles
and fight a battle at the end of it.

48:01.311 --> 48:03.229
Well, there's daft, it is then.

48:03.313 --> 48:06.649
I don't see no sense in running
to fight a battle.

48:11.822 --> 48:15.158
What are you doing here in such a time
like this? Why don't you go?

48:15.242 --> 48:17.744
No. Not until you have gone.

48:18.662 --> 48:22.582
You know Cetshwayo has a regiment
of young girls, warriors,

48:22.666 --> 48:25.835
called Ripen At Noon.

48:27.504 --> 48:29.088
There's pretty.

48:29.840 --> 48:33.050
Hey, come on. Come on. Here.

48:33.177 --> 48:36.012
Here! Here! Give us... Come on.
Come on. Just a little kiss?

48:36.096 --> 48:37.847
Hey! Yeah! Come on!

49:13.884 --> 49:18.471
Hey. Hey, boys! Take a look at this.

49:21.433 --> 49:24.352
- What is it, boyo?
- Flaming dust. What else?

49:24.436 --> 49:26.646
No, by damn, it's horses!

49:34.613 --> 49:35.738
The cavalry!

49:35.823 --> 49:39.450
Yeah. It's a relief column,
you long-range sniper, you.

49:48.919 --> 49:50.586
Colour Sergeant?

49:51.922 --> 49:53.172
Sir?

50:09.147 --> 50:10.773
Stephenson, Durnford's Horse.

50:10.858 --> 50:13.818
- Thank God you're here.
- I'm surprised you're still here.

50:13.902 --> 50:15.945
You know there are 4,000 Zulus
coming this way?

50:16.029 --> 50:18.948
We know. Can you throw out your men
in a screen to the south of here?

50:19.032 --> 50:20.783
You know how the Zulus feel
about cavalry.

50:20.868 --> 50:24.120
I know how my men feel about Zulus.
We've only just got through them.

50:24.204 --> 50:28.082
- Stephenson.
- Bromhead. What price, this?

50:28.166 --> 50:30.418
I know your whole regiment's gone.

50:30.502 --> 50:33.379
Bromhead? You know this man.
Tell him we need him.

50:33.463 --> 50:35.673
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look at my men.

50:35.757 --> 50:38.217
Stand fast. Stand fast, all of you!

50:38.302 --> 50:40.845
Where the hell are they going?
Get them back here!

50:40.929 --> 50:44.432
- Let go of my bridle!
- Get them back here!

50:44.516 --> 50:46.767
If they're going to die,
they'll die on their own farms.

50:46.852 --> 50:49.812
You're the professionals.
You fight here if you want to.

50:49.897 --> 50:54.692
We need you! Don't go! Don't go! Stay!

50:58.280 --> 51:01.782
We need you, damn you! We need you!

51:11.418 --> 51:13.920
You didn't say a single word
to help, Bromhead.

51:14.004 --> 51:17.298
Oh, when you take command, old boy,
you're on your own.

51:17.382 --> 51:21.344
The first lesson the General,
my grandfather, ever taught me.

52:12.729 --> 52:14.397
All right, then.

52:16.233 --> 52:18.734
Nobody told you to stop working.

52:27.077 --> 52:30.287
Brothers! Oh, brothers!

52:30.414 --> 52:33.624
The way of the Lord
has been shown to us.

52:33.750 --> 52:37.086
"Thou shalt not kill," saith the Lord.

52:37.754 --> 52:41.257
Brothers! Oh, brothers!

52:42.009 --> 52:44.593
God's love is peace.

52:44.678 --> 52:47.596
- Colour Sergeant Bourne?
- Go in peace!

52:47.681 --> 52:52.435
Stay not to kill and be killed. Go, I say.

52:59.317 --> 53:05.197
The sin of Cain will be upon you.
"Am I my brother's keeper?" asked Cain.

53:05.282 --> 53:08.868
Yea, we are all our brother's keeper.

53:12.456 --> 53:15.041
"The nations are but a drop of a bucket,

53:15.125 --> 53:19.003
"and are counted as the small dust
of the balance."

53:23.633 --> 53:25.134
Bring him along.

53:32.642 --> 53:35.478
Mr Witt, I'm getting you off this post.

53:35.562 --> 53:39.482
Sir, they've all hopped it. All of them.

53:44.154 --> 53:47.364
Give me those wagons
and I will save the sick.

53:51.870 --> 53:53.704
You want the wagons?

53:54.414 --> 53:55.831
Mr Bourne? Windridge?
Get those wagons in.

53:55.916 --> 53:57.041
Sir.

53:58.168 --> 54:02.088
God loves a sinner
come to his understanding.

54:19.022 --> 54:20.773
Hey, we're in luck.

54:21.900 --> 54:25.444
Hey, looks like the old parson
got Chard to let us go.

54:47.050 --> 54:48.259
Heave!

55:00.397 --> 55:02.523
Right, lads. Heave.

55:03.775 --> 55:05.025
Heave.

55:30.886 --> 55:33.179
Oh, Lord, God, give me strength!

55:35.432 --> 55:38.100
Oh, God! God forgive me.

55:39.394 --> 55:43.981
I have the strength of thousands
while the spirit of God is with me.

55:45.066 --> 55:47.359
- Colour Sergeant Bourne?
- Sir.

55:51.156 --> 55:53.282
Oh, God, forgive me.

55:54.242 --> 55:56.285
Get him away from here.

56:03.543 --> 56:06.587
Leave him alone! Leave him alone!

56:06.671 --> 56:08.047
Miss Witt!

56:10.217 --> 56:14.011
Animals! All of you! Animals!

56:14.095 --> 56:16.013
- Sgt Woodridge.
- Sir!

56:16.097 --> 56:20.100
We shall not go. If you send us away,
we shall come back.

56:20.185 --> 56:21.769
Lock him up. Lock him in the storeroom.

56:21.853 --> 56:23.145
- Put a man on the door.
- Sir.

56:23.230 --> 56:25.898
All right, you men, get back to work.

56:26.566 --> 56:27.942
And you.

56:29.945 --> 56:31.362
Put Miss Witt in the church
with Surgeon Reynolds.

56:31.446 --> 56:32.571
Sir.

56:56.304 --> 56:59.431
It was sad, you know. And sick.

57:00.100 --> 57:02.226
Had a battle coming, see?

57:02.978 --> 57:05.354
Animals are very sensitive to noise,
you know.

57:05.438 --> 57:06.814
Why worry about a calf?

57:06.898 --> 57:10.401
I thought I was tired of farming.
No adventure in it.

57:11.611 --> 57:13.487
But when you look at it,

57:13.571 --> 57:17.658
this country's not a bit as good as Bala
and the lake there.

57:17.742 --> 57:19.785
Not really green, like.

57:21.705 --> 57:23.247
And the soil.

57:28.128 --> 57:30.254
There's no moisture in it.

57:32.590 --> 57:35.217
Nothing to hold a man in his grave.

57:49.482 --> 57:53.235
Chard? One of my men, Hook.

57:53.320 --> 57:55.529
- Do you know him?
- No.

57:55.613 --> 57:58.157
In the hospital, malingering,
under arrest.

57:58.241 --> 58:02.453
He's a thief, a coward and
an insubordinate barrack-room lawyer.

58:02.537 --> 58:05.414
- And you've given him a rifle.
- What?

58:05.498 --> 58:08.751
In Queen's regulations,
it specifically states...

58:21.556 --> 58:22.973
Damn funny.

58:24.351 --> 58:29.063
Like a... Like a train in the distance.

59:01.096 --> 59:03.263
You were saying about Hook?

59:10.814 --> 59:13.357
Mr Bromhead, sir? Sentries come in
from the hill. They say...

59:13.441 --> 59:15.275
- Colour Sergeant?
- Sir.

59:15.360 --> 59:17.903
- You have something to report?
- Sir?

59:18.363 --> 59:19.863
Then tell me.

59:23.201 --> 59:24.743
Very good, sir.

59:24.828 --> 59:29.123
The sentries report Zulus to
the southwest, thousands of them.

59:37.340 --> 59:40.050
All right, Colour Sergeant, stand to.

59:47.142 --> 59:49.893
Stand to!

01:00:17.797 --> 01:00:20.674
Look to your front. Mark the orders.

01:00:21.509 --> 01:00:25.345
Mark the target when it comes.
Look to your front.

01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:29.308
Mark your target when it comes.
Look to your front.

01:00:29.392 --> 01:00:33.020
Look to your front.
Mark your target when it comes.

01:00:34.189 --> 01:00:36.857
Mark your target. Look to your front.

01:00:39.944 --> 01:00:43.280
- Hitch, do your tunic up.
- My tunic?

01:00:43.364 --> 01:00:46.325
Do it up.
Where do you think you are, man?

01:00:47.035 --> 01:00:48.202
Look to your front.

01:00:49.204 --> 01:00:52.247
Mark your target when it comes.
To your front.

01:00:52.332 --> 01:00:55.626
- Mark your target when it comes.
- Look to your front.

01:00:55.710 --> 01:00:59.880
Mark the orders.
Mark your target when it comes.

01:01:01.049 --> 01:01:03.425
- Look to your front.
- Mark your target when it comes.

01:01:15.188 --> 01:01:17.898
Boy? You hear me, boy?

01:01:19.192 --> 01:01:21.985
Will you be Cain and kill your brother?

01:01:22.612 --> 01:01:25.405
"Thou shalt not kill," saith the Lord.

01:01:25.907 --> 01:01:28.867
You believe in the Lord's word,
don't you?

01:01:30.453 --> 01:01:34.039
Obey the word, boy. Obey the Lord.

01:01:35.875 --> 01:01:37.793
Go to the others.

01:01:37.877 --> 01:01:40.671
Boy, go to the others.

01:01:47.345 --> 01:01:48.637
He's...

01:01:50.014 --> 01:01:53.225
- Mr Witt says...
- Never mind him, boy.

01:02:01.234 --> 01:02:04.695
Now, you get along back to the ramparts
with your mates.

01:02:04.779 --> 01:02:06.113
Yes, sir.

01:02:15.915 --> 01:02:20.252
Mr Witt, sir? Be quiet now, will you?
There's a good gentleman.

01:02:20.878 --> 01:02:22.671
You'll upset the lads.

01:02:41.816 --> 01:02:44.860
- You know my father was at Waterloo.
- He was?

01:02:45.612 --> 01:02:48.030
He got his colonelcy after that.

01:02:49.324 --> 01:02:50.532
Did he?

01:02:52.201 --> 01:02:54.786
And my great-grandfather,

01:02:54.871 --> 01:02:58.332
he was the Johnny
who knelt beside Wolfe at Quebec.

01:02:59.459 --> 01:03:01.877
Did they make him a colonel too?

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:06.673
No, you don't see what I'm driving at.

01:03:09.177 --> 01:03:12.304
You're telling me you're
the professional, I'm the amateur.

01:03:12.388 --> 01:03:15.057
No. What I mean is...

01:03:15.808 --> 01:03:21.021
I mean, I wish right now,
I were a damned ranker,

01:03:22.065 --> 01:03:24.858
like Hook or Hitch.

01:03:26.235 --> 01:03:28.070
You're not, are you?

01:03:28.529 --> 01:03:31.031
You're an officer and a gentleman.

01:03:32.533 --> 01:03:33.825
Listen.

01:03:35.912 --> 01:03:38.038
That damned train again.

01:04:31.134 --> 01:04:36.805
"He breaketh the bow
and snappeth the spear in sunder!"

01:04:36.889 --> 01:04:39.599
"I will be exalted among the heathen.

01:04:40.810 --> 01:04:43.311
"I will be exalted in the earth.

01:04:44.564 --> 01:04:46.982
"The Lord of hosts is with us."

01:04:48.317 --> 01:04:51.820
I hope so. As I live and die, I hope so.

01:05:09.839 --> 01:05:12.966
Company will fix bayonets!

01:05:14.635 --> 01:05:15.677
Fix!

01:05:18.848 --> 01:05:20.182
Bayonets!

01:05:24.687 --> 01:05:27.522
Attention!

01:05:31.194 --> 01:05:34.154
You slovenly soldier, Hitch.

01:08:29.121 --> 01:08:30.497
Load!

01:10:20.816 --> 01:10:23.318
North rampart, stand fast!

01:10:25.654 --> 01:10:29.616
South rampart at 100 yards!

01:10:32.286 --> 01:10:33.828
Volley fire!

01:10:34.830 --> 01:10:36.164
Present!

01:10:55.684 --> 01:10:56.851
Fire!

01:10:57.353 --> 01:10:58.603
Reload!

01:11:09.115 --> 01:11:14.994
Fire!

01:11:15.371 --> 01:11:16.704
Reload!

01:11:17.206 --> 01:11:20.500
Independent, fire at will!

01:11:21.544 --> 01:11:23.336
That's very nice of him.

01:11:48.195 --> 01:11:49.821
They're just standing there asking for it.

01:11:49.905 --> 01:11:51.489
Keep firing, soldier.

01:11:51.574 --> 01:11:54.075
Mark your targets before you fire.

01:11:59.415 --> 01:12:01.666
Adendorff, what's wrong with them?

01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:05.336
- Why don't they fight?
- They're counting your guns.

01:12:05.421 --> 01:12:06.504
What?

01:12:06.589 --> 01:12:09.090
Can't you see that old boy up
on the hill?

01:12:09.216 --> 01:12:11.009
He's counting your guns.

01:12:11.093 --> 01:12:14.846
Testing your firing power
with the lives of his warriors.

01:12:30.279 --> 01:12:31.779
Cease firing!

01:12:42.124 --> 01:12:44.626
- Well?
- They'll be back.

01:12:47.046 --> 01:12:48.546
Stand fast!

01:12:50.257 --> 01:12:53.301
Sixty. We dropped at least 60,
wouldn't you say?

01:12:53.427 --> 01:12:55.637
That leaves only 3,940.

01:12:56.555 --> 01:13:01.726
"Rise up, my love, my fair one,
and come away.

01:13:02.937 --> 01:13:06.564
"Behold, thou art fair, my love!"

01:13:07.608 --> 01:13:08.900
How long?

01:13:09.818 --> 01:13:12.570
Ten, 15 minutes. Maybe less.

01:13:13.447 --> 01:13:15.073
As soon as they've regrouped.

01:13:15.157 --> 01:13:19.744
"Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet,

01:13:20.246 --> 01:13:23.331
"and thy speech is comely."

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:26.000
He can't be!

01:13:26.794 --> 01:13:30.004
He is. Drunk as a Lord.

01:13:31.966 --> 01:13:34.801
- Fifteen minutes.
- If we're lucky.

01:13:37.471 --> 01:13:38.763
Colour Sergeant Bourne?

01:13:38.847 --> 01:13:43.184
"Many waters cannot quench love,

01:13:43.269 --> 01:13:47.188
"neither can the floods drown it."

01:13:47.314 --> 01:13:49.983
Yes, sir, the gentleman has a bottle.

01:13:50.776 --> 01:13:52.527
Then get him out of here.

01:13:52.653 --> 01:13:55.780
Put him on his cart.
Tie him on if necessary.

01:13:55.864 --> 01:13:57.198
The sooner we get rid of them
the better.

01:13:57.324 --> 01:13:58.491
Sir.

01:14:02.621 --> 01:14:06.207
Chard. They won't stand a chance
with the Zulus.

01:14:07.376 --> 01:14:09.210
They're Witt's parishioners, aren't they?

01:14:09.336 --> 01:14:12.463
But the woman,
do you want to see her killed?

01:14:13.465 --> 01:14:15.216
Do you, Bromhead?

01:14:15.634 --> 01:14:18.970
Because you will
if we don't get them out of here.

01:14:28.522 --> 01:14:31.399
Come along, sir.
There's a good gentleman.

01:14:38.198 --> 01:14:40.199
All right, pick him up.

01:14:47.082 --> 01:14:51.085
"I have sinned against heaven,
and before thee."

01:14:56.592 --> 01:14:57.884
Oh, no!

01:15:11.023 --> 01:15:12.273
Father!

01:15:19.365 --> 01:15:22.075
"Peace be within thy walls..."

01:15:23.702 --> 01:15:24.952
Father!

01:15:30.084 --> 01:15:33.961
Keep driving with the sun at your back.
You should make it safely.

01:15:34.046 --> 01:15:35.380
Sergeant!

01:15:35.881 --> 01:15:38.633
- Father!
- Leave me alone!

01:15:41.804 --> 01:15:44.263
Try to understand him, Miss Witt.

01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:47.058
Death awaits you!

01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:52.271
You have made a covenant with death
and with hell you are in agreement!

01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:55.316
You're all going to die!

01:15:56.193 --> 01:15:57.985
Don't you realise?

01:15:58.654 --> 01:16:00.154
Can't you see?

01:16:01.281 --> 01:16:03.825
You're all going to die!

01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:09.622
Die!

01:16:12.334 --> 01:16:15.753
- Death awaits you all!
- He's right.

01:16:15.838 --> 01:16:17.130
Die!

01:16:18.006 --> 01:16:19.507
Why is it us?

01:16:19.967 --> 01:16:21.634
- Die!
- Why us?

01:16:23.011 --> 01:16:26.681
Because we're here, lad,
and nobody else.

01:16:29.476 --> 01:16:30.685
Just us.

01:16:37.443 --> 01:16:39.193
Colour Sergeant.

01:16:39.278 --> 01:16:42.530
Right, now get back to your posts.
At the double.

01:17:47.429 --> 01:17:49.514
Here they come again!

01:17:53.769 --> 01:17:55.269
Volley!

01:17:56.021 --> 01:17:57.230
Fire!

01:18:05.239 --> 01:18:08.866
- I can't see a bloody one now.
- They've gone to ground.

01:18:11.203 --> 01:18:12.578
Reload!

01:19:06.758 --> 01:19:08.342
There they go!

01:19:09.386 --> 01:19:11.762
Eyes front. Look to the front!

01:19:12.514 --> 01:19:14.640
What the devil's going on?

01:19:16.727 --> 01:19:19.270
Well, tell me what's happening.
I've got to know.

01:19:19.354 --> 01:19:21.272
They're on both sides!

01:19:21.356 --> 01:19:23.107
We haven't enough men
at the north wall.

01:19:23.191 --> 01:19:25.651
Can't you take some from the south?

01:19:25.736 --> 01:19:27.695
How will we hold that if we do?

01:19:27.779 --> 01:19:29.447
Damn it, Adendorff,
you're supposed to know.

01:19:29.531 --> 01:19:30.948
Are they going to hit us
everywhere at once?

01:19:31.033 --> 01:19:34.201
I told you, remember.
The horns of the buffelo.

01:19:34.286 --> 01:19:36.495
The south could have been a feint.

01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:39.582
We can't man the whole perimeter.
We've got to outgun them somewhere.

01:19:39.708 --> 01:19:40.916
Right?

01:19:48.216 --> 01:19:52.553
All right, Bromhead, take men
from the south, one section in three.

01:19:54.389 --> 01:19:56.557
Reinforce the north wall.

01:19:56.642 --> 01:19:58.851
But if they do come
from the south again?

01:19:58.935 --> 01:20:01.979
Get on with it, Mr Bromhead.
At the double.

01:20:03.190 --> 01:20:05.733
Colour Sergeant Bourne,
I want every other man

01:20:05.859 --> 01:20:09.111
from sections one, three and five
over at the north wall.

01:20:13.241 --> 01:20:15.493
Come on, then, at the double.

01:20:16.411 --> 01:20:17.787
First two.

01:20:19.956 --> 01:20:21.415
Follow me.

01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:25.961
Where would you like me?

01:20:27.255 --> 01:20:29.256
You pick your own ground.

01:20:29.925 --> 01:20:32.176
It's your country, isn't it?

01:21:35.157 --> 01:21:37.408
Hey, who left the door open?

01:21:46.001 --> 01:21:47.710
Blazes!
Where the deuce did they get those?

01:21:47.794 --> 01:21:50.296
I'd say, off the bodies of your regiment
at Isandhlwana.

01:21:50.380 --> 01:21:53.007
Now, that's a bitter pill,
our own damn rifles!

01:22:06.354 --> 01:22:08.272
Keep your heads down.

01:22:12.027 --> 01:22:13.611
- Corporal Allen!
- Sir.

01:22:13.695 --> 01:22:15.321
- This is your section now.
- Sir.

01:22:15.405 --> 01:22:17.239
Well, see, if you can keep the heads
of those marksmen down.

01:22:17.365 --> 01:22:18.908
Can't see none of them, sir.

01:22:18.992 --> 01:22:21.202
You should know, Corporal Allen,
fire at the smoke.

01:22:21.286 --> 01:22:24.163
- Keep them pinned down, not us.
- Sir.

01:22:25.916 --> 01:22:27.708
Fire at the smoke.

01:22:57.155 --> 01:22:58.739
Mr Bromhead!

01:23:04.162 --> 01:23:06.914
- Not the best of shots, are they?
- Get a platoon together.

01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:09.583
I'll need more than one, old boy,
if I'm going up there after them.

01:23:09.668 --> 01:23:13.254
You're not going up there after them.
Get a platoon of good bayonet men.

01:23:13.338 --> 01:23:15.840
Take them head on at anything that
breaks through where our lines weaken.

01:23:15.924 --> 01:23:18.050
- It's still a holding action, is it?
- That's right.

01:23:18.134 --> 01:23:20.594
Your job is to plug the gaps
from the inside.

01:23:20.679 --> 01:23:23.764
- And get yourself a good sergeant.
- Yes, sir!

01:23:59.301 --> 01:24:00.718
Hitch! Get down from there!

01:24:00.802 --> 01:24:02.970
How can I shoot them
if I can't see them?

01:24:07.392 --> 01:24:09.476
- Hitch!
- My leg! Corp!

01:24:34.002 --> 01:24:35.169
Corp?

01:24:37.005 --> 01:24:41.091
Can I undo my tunic buttons now,
can I, Corp?

01:24:56.107 --> 01:24:57.858
Stretcher bearers!

01:25:02.447 --> 01:25:04.573
Come on, attack, damn you!

01:25:12.749 --> 01:25:14.583
Here they come!

01:25:16.378 --> 01:25:19.213
North wall, volley fire! Present!

01:25:19.297 --> 01:25:20.923
At 100 yards!

01:25:23.343 --> 01:25:24.635
Fire!

01:25:24.719 --> 01:25:26.053
Reload!

01:25:26.137 --> 01:25:28.764
Independent, fire at will!

01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:09.323
- Bromhead!
- Follow me!

01:27:12.869 --> 01:27:14.453
Bromhead!

01:28:32.866 --> 01:28:35.075
Mr Chard, I'll get you help.

01:29:03.104 --> 01:29:05.772
Keep our squad on the wall, Sergeant.

01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:13.280
Chard! Are you all right?

01:29:15.158 --> 01:29:19.077
Take command.

01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:23.373
Corporal!

01:29:24.584 --> 01:29:26.668
You're the professional.

01:29:27.754 --> 01:29:30.589
- Take command.
- Lance Corporal!

01:29:30.673 --> 01:29:33.592
Now, listen, old boy,
you're not badly hurt.

01:29:33.676 --> 01:29:37.471
We need you!
Damn you, we need you. Understand?

01:29:38.264 --> 01:29:40.057
Get him to Surgeon Reynolds.

01:29:40.141 --> 01:29:43.018
Take command. You want it, don't you?

01:29:43.102 --> 01:29:45.145
- Sergeant Windridge!
- Sir!

01:30:07.293 --> 01:30:08.585
Scalpel.

01:30:14.300 --> 01:30:17.469
Orderly, damn it!
Will you keep the flies away!

01:30:19.013 --> 01:30:20.222
Fan it!

01:30:20.974 --> 01:30:24.059
Damn you, Chard!
Damn all you butchers!

01:30:38.157 --> 01:30:40.784
Why? Why?

01:30:42.787 --> 01:30:43.996
Why?

01:30:46.207 --> 01:30:49.001
- Why?
- It's all right, boy, you sleep.

01:30:49.085 --> 01:30:51.586
I'm damned if I can tell you why.

01:30:57.885 --> 01:30:59.636
You know this boy?

01:30:59.721 --> 01:31:02.681
Name of Cole, sir.
He was a paperhanger.

01:31:04.767 --> 01:31:07.060
He's a dead paperhanger now.

01:31:07.895 --> 01:31:09.229
Orderlies!

01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:25.912
Are you all right?

01:31:45.725 --> 01:31:48.018
There they go, boys. After them!

01:31:48.102 --> 01:31:51.813
Stand fast! They're retiring, sir.

01:31:51.898 --> 01:31:54.066
North wall, hold your fire.

01:31:55.151 --> 01:31:56.360
Down!

01:32:01.199 --> 01:32:03.450
What is it now? Another blasted trick?

01:32:03.534 --> 01:32:05.827
They're forming up on the south plain
again, sir.

01:32:05.953 --> 01:32:09.456
I knew it! I knew it! They're going
to attack both walls at once.

01:32:09.540 --> 01:32:12.834
I doubt it, not unless
they have no other choice anyhow.

01:32:12.919 --> 01:32:15.629
It could mean the old general
couldn't use his rifles on the hill side

01:32:15.713 --> 01:32:17.964
for fear of hitting down to his own men.

01:32:18.049 --> 01:32:20.634
This way, he keeps probing
for weaknesses on the one wall

01:32:20.718 --> 01:32:23.178
while he keeps the other one
pinned down.

01:32:23.262 --> 01:32:24.554
Oh, yes.

01:32:35.817 --> 01:32:38.235
They're on the move, sir!

01:32:38.319 --> 01:32:41.738
North wall, keep those riflemen
on the hill side pinned down.

01:32:41.823 --> 01:32:44.324
South wall, volley fire!

01:32:44.450 --> 01:32:45.700
Present!

01:32:51.332 --> 01:32:52.541
Fire!

01:32:53.459 --> 01:32:54.543
Reload!

01:32:57.672 --> 01:33:00.715
- Hookie, come on, boy, do something!
- I'm excused duty.

01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:04.302
- Well, I haven't excused you, have I?
- You want some help.

01:33:04.387 --> 01:33:06.596
Well, why didn't you say so?

01:33:24.157 --> 01:33:27.159
This rifle! Honestly, I can't manage it.

01:33:27.243 --> 01:33:30.787
Now, now, you heard
what the officer said. Come on.

01:33:30.872 --> 01:33:35.375
But if it really came down to it, sir,
I couldn't really shoot anyone.

01:33:36.461 --> 01:33:38.545
Careful! Pop that chap, somebody!

01:33:43.551 --> 01:33:46.386
Good fellow. Good fellow. You see?

01:33:48.473 --> 01:33:49.764
Sir!

01:33:50.892 --> 01:33:52.058
Sir.

01:34:21.631 --> 01:34:23.673
Now, you're doing fine.

01:34:24.592 --> 01:34:25.800
Where...

01:34:27.011 --> 01:34:29.262
You want to rest here a bit?

01:34:36.479 --> 01:34:37.812
Watch it!

01:34:44.111 --> 01:34:45.904
Can you move your leg?

01:34:45.988 --> 01:34:48.198
- If you want me to dance.
- I want you to crawl.

01:34:48.282 --> 01:34:51.785
Come on, you slovenly soldier,
we've got work to do.

01:34:59.293 --> 01:35:01.378
It's all right, sir, we'll do that for you.

01:35:01.462 --> 01:35:02.546
I'm all right.

01:35:02.630 --> 01:35:05.131
You better get along to the surgeon, sir.

01:35:05.216 --> 01:35:07.259
I'll try to get someone to help you, sir.

01:35:07.343 --> 01:35:08.843
I can manage.

01:35:14.725 --> 01:35:24.317
Here.

01:35:29.865 --> 01:35:33.034
Hold them! Hold them!

01:35:37.248 --> 01:35:40.000
Hey, Noel, Tommy, look!

01:35:43.170 --> 01:35:44.546
Oh, my God!

01:35:44.672 --> 01:35:49.175
Bromhead, reorganise your
flying platoon with Sgt Windridge.

01:35:49.260 --> 01:35:51.511
But I... Yes, sir, of course.

01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:54.264
Sir.

01:35:55.016 --> 01:35:57.642
- Well done, Corporal. Stand by.
- Sir.

01:36:06.235 --> 01:36:08.278
Colour Sergeant Bourne!

01:36:11.282 --> 01:36:13.575
Sir? Are you all right, sir?

01:36:15.202 --> 01:36:17.120
Thank you, Mr Bourne.

01:36:19.081 --> 01:36:21.207
The men on the church roof,

01:36:22.001 --> 01:36:24.461
have them support your fire
against the hillside.

01:36:24.545 --> 01:36:26.046
- Corporal?
- Sir.

01:36:26.547 --> 01:36:30.508
Section on the roof, bring your
rifles about on the hillside.

01:36:30.593 --> 01:36:32.302
Fire at the smoke.

01:36:32.386 --> 01:36:34.346
- The men on the hospital loopholes...
- Sir.

01:36:34.430 --> 01:36:37.015
...they've nothing to fire at.

01:36:37.099 --> 01:36:39.976
Bring them to the front windows
to support the north wall.

01:36:40.061 --> 01:36:41.227
Sir.

01:36:41.312 --> 01:36:43.146
Colour Sergeant?

01:36:43.230 --> 01:36:44.898
- Sir.
- I want half your men now.

01:36:45.024 --> 01:36:47.233
An even number, sir?

01:36:47.318 --> 01:36:49.903
- Form two lines on the double.
- Sir!

01:37:02.708 --> 01:37:07.545
Company!

01:37:20.601 --> 01:37:23.103
Fall back! Clear the line of fire!

01:37:25.773 --> 01:37:27.899
Front rank! Fire!

01:37:28.693 --> 01:37:32.362
Rear rank! Fire! Advance!

01:37:34.407 --> 01:37:35.824
Rear rank!

01:37:36.450 --> 01:37:38.576
Fire! Advance!

01:37:40.121 --> 01:37:49.045
Rear rank! Fire! Advance!

01:37:50.715 --> 01:37:52.215
Rear rank!

01:37:53.134 --> 01:37:55.343
Fire! Advance!

01:37:56.971 --> 01:38:00.849
Rear rank! Fire! Advance!

01:38:00.933 --> 01:38:02.308
Rear rank!

01:38:03.144 --> 01:38:05.311
Fire! Advance!

01:38:08.274 --> 01:38:12.193
Rear rank! Fire! Advance!

01:38:13.279 --> 01:38:14.571
Rear rank!

01:38:15.281 --> 01:38:16.823
Fire! Advance!

01:38:16.907 --> 01:38:18.992
Independent, fire at will!

01:38:41.974 --> 01:38:43.475
Cease firing!

01:39:40.199 --> 01:39:43.618
- Hey, Thomas. There's some water.
- Oh, thank God!

01:40:02.263 --> 01:40:06.057
- Hey, 470 Davies was hit, you know.
- No!

01:40:06.141 --> 01:40:08.226
Aye, in the throat.

01:40:10.396 --> 01:40:11.938
What a pity.

01:40:12.398 --> 01:40:14.941
The man is a great bass baritone.

01:40:16.026 --> 01:40:17.777
In the throat, is it?

01:40:17.862 --> 01:40:18.987
Aye.

01:40:19.613 --> 01:40:21.364
Hey, where are you going?

01:40:21.448 --> 01:40:22.949
I'm going to see that calf, man.

01:40:23.033 --> 01:40:25.827
Hey, come back, you fool!
What are you doing?

01:40:25.911 --> 01:40:27.120
Tommy!

01:40:29.039 --> 01:40:33.209
Mr Bourne, there should be 12 more
men working on this redoubt.

01:40:33.961 --> 01:40:36.004
They're very tired, sir.

01:40:37.506 --> 01:40:39.299
I don't give a damn.

01:40:39.842 --> 01:40:43.428
I want this nine foot high,
firing steps inside.

01:40:44.430 --> 01:40:46.973
Form details to clear away
the Zulu bodies.

01:40:47.099 --> 01:40:50.476
Rebuild the south ramparts.
Keep them moving.

01:40:52.271 --> 01:40:54.606
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

01:40:55.024 --> 01:40:56.649
Very good, sir.

01:41:03.616 --> 01:41:05.992
All right, lads, keep it moving.

01:41:16.670 --> 01:41:19.589
We're next, boys. This is the blind spot.

01:41:22.635 --> 01:41:26.888
Even if those flaming officers
ain't seen it, I bet the Zulus have.

01:41:28.599 --> 01:41:31.893
- Come on, Howarth, put your money up.
- Have you gone stupid?

01:41:31.977 --> 01:41:34.479
What bloody good you think
it will do you if you do win?

01:41:34.563 --> 01:41:35.605
We're all goners!

01:41:35.689 --> 01:41:38.608
Well, it don't matter if you lose, does it?

01:41:41.445 --> 01:41:42.904
Hey, Hookie.

01:41:44.490 --> 01:41:45.740
Hughsie.

01:41:47.993 --> 01:41:51.162
There's some brandy in Reynolds'
medical cabinet, go and borrow some.

01:41:51.246 --> 01:41:53.539
- It's locked up down that end.
- Kick it down, then.

01:41:53.624 --> 01:41:56.042
Hey, that's company punishment.

01:41:57.169 --> 01:41:58.586
Company punishment.

01:41:58.671 --> 01:42:00.546
On the right.

01:42:00.714 --> 01:42:03.049
Form close columns of platoons.

01:42:04.051 --> 01:42:07.220
- By the right!
- You lucky bastard!

01:42:24.363 --> 01:42:26.239
Oh dear. Oh dear.

01:42:27.616 --> 01:42:31.536
Well, your mum will need somebody
to milk her now, won't she?

01:42:51.390 --> 01:42:53.099
Stand to!

01:42:53.183 --> 01:42:55.852
All right, all right, I can hear you.

01:44:57.224 --> 01:45:00.059
Out you get, Hookie,
you've done your bit.

01:45:14.741 --> 01:45:17.243
Quick! Thousands of them! 612!

01:45:29.256 --> 01:45:31.299
Knock a hole in that wall!

01:46:00.662 --> 01:46:02.747
Better get down now, sir.

01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:08.044
Sir!

01:46:10.297 --> 01:46:11.964
Get down now, sir!

01:46:19.973 --> 01:46:22.058
No! Jones, it's me!

01:46:22.142 --> 01:46:24.685
Come on, get through,
you bloody Englishman!

01:46:40.702 --> 01:46:43.871
Get out! Get out! Get out!

01:47:06.395 --> 01:47:08.062
Jonesy!

01:47:20.993 --> 01:47:22.660
Come on up!

01:47:38.176 --> 01:47:41.012
Get to Surgeon Reynolds.
Right, get on the wall.

01:47:55.402 --> 01:47:56.694
Hook!

01:47:57.612 --> 01:47:59.071
I know you!

01:48:00.574 --> 01:48:02.658
What about the money
you sent my old woman?

01:48:02.743 --> 01:48:03.951
Hook!

01:48:22.763 --> 01:48:24.430
That's it, Hook, my lad!

01:48:24.556 --> 01:48:26.307
That's it, soldier!

01:48:35.609 --> 01:48:36.942
Hookie!

01:48:44.576 --> 01:48:46.827
Stay where you are, Maxfield!

01:48:50.290 --> 01:48:52.833
Hookie! Hookie!

01:48:52.959 --> 01:48:54.418
Get out! Get out, man.

01:48:57.798 --> 01:49:00.049
That's my boy, Hook!

01:49:00.133 --> 01:49:03.803
You're a soldier now!
I've made a soldier of you!

01:49:03.929 --> 01:49:06.097
Where's my bloody sergeant?

01:49:25.367 --> 01:49:27.118
Get out! Come on!

01:49:37.462 --> 01:49:38.504
- Is everybody out?
- Yes, sir.

01:49:38.630 --> 01:49:40.047
On the wall.

01:49:41.675 --> 01:49:46.303
Hookie? Where's Hookie? Hookie?
Come down, Hookie! Hookie!

01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:09.869
Hookie! That's a flogging offence!

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.334
Get out, for God's sake, man!

01:50:28.722 --> 01:50:31.098
- Everybody out?
- Everybody that will get out.

01:50:35.228 --> 01:50:40.441
- Abandon the outside ramparts.
- Bugler! Retire to this wall!

01:51:56.017 --> 01:51:57.601
- Colour Sergeant.
- Sir.

01:51:57.686 --> 01:52:00.980
- Carry on building the inner redoubt.
- Sir!

01:52:01.064 --> 01:52:04.066
All right, nobody told you
to stop working!

01:52:25.505 --> 01:52:27.089
Look at that.

01:52:29.509 --> 01:52:32.177
- Do you think he wanted it that way?
- Look at it burn!

01:52:42.063 --> 01:52:43.856
Any more in there?

01:52:47.402 --> 01:52:50.571
Then we'll have to take them
from the outside walls.

01:52:54.451 --> 01:52:56.869
- Colour Sergeant Bourne.
- Sir?

01:53:00.749 --> 01:53:02.124
Hey, Owen?

01:53:04.419 --> 01:53:06.962
- Are you awake, man?
- What is it?

01:53:07.797 --> 01:53:10.674
I didn't think it was going to die though.

01:53:10.759 --> 01:53:14.762
- Can you see something?
- No, the calf, I'm talking about.

01:53:16.264 --> 01:53:18.057
There's sorry I am.

01:53:18.433 --> 01:53:19.600
Aye.

01:53:20.393 --> 01:53:22.144
Seems a pity, doesn't it?

01:53:28.068 --> 01:53:31.070
How many times have they come
since sunset do you reckon?

01:53:31.154 --> 01:53:32.655
I don't know.

01:53:33.907 --> 01:53:35.407
Do you reckon they'll come again?

01:53:39.788 --> 01:53:43.082
I think they've got more guts
than we have, boyo.

01:53:47.087 --> 01:53:48.337
Soldiers!

01:54:05.480 --> 01:54:07.690
All right, back to your posts.

01:54:07.774 --> 01:54:11.110
You, hold there.
Orderly, see to these men.

01:54:56.322 --> 01:54:57.990
Colour Sergeant.

01:54:59.993 --> 01:55:04.163
Put a third of our men in the redoubt.
Send the bugler to me.

01:55:07.167 --> 01:55:08.876
I was asleep, sir.

01:55:10.587 --> 01:55:12.337
You let me sleep?

01:55:13.673 --> 01:55:15.883
You shouldn't have done that.

01:55:23.016 --> 01:55:24.850
Is there any water?

01:55:25.769 --> 01:55:27.895
I sent what was left to Reynolds.

01:55:28.021 --> 01:55:29.563
Yes, of course.

01:55:31.733 --> 01:55:34.359
It's fear dries the mouth, isn't it?

01:55:36.029 --> 01:55:38.405
When a man's as thirsty as this.

01:55:40.575 --> 01:55:42.743
I could have drunk a river.

01:55:48.625 --> 01:55:50.876
Thank you for what you said.

01:55:53.755 --> 01:55:56.882
Oh, you mean about our needing you?

01:55:57.717 --> 01:56:01.386
Yes. Don't bother, old boy, it's true.

01:56:04.057 --> 01:56:05.140
Sir?

01:56:07.143 --> 01:56:08.644
Come with me.

01:56:17.445 --> 01:56:21.448
Get in the redoubt, my lucky lads.
Make a move.

01:56:23.409 --> 01:56:25.077
Come on. Come on.

01:57:07.453 --> 01:57:10.789
All right, lads, take up your positions
on the firing step.

01:57:10.874 --> 01:57:12.791
Keep your heads down.

01:57:34.522 --> 01:57:36.690
- How old are you, boy?
- Sir?

01:57:38.568 --> 01:57:40.319
It doesn't matter.

01:57:40.653 --> 01:57:42.654
You know how to sound?

01:57:42.906 --> 01:57:44.197
Yes, sir.

01:57:45.158 --> 01:57:46.533
Stay by me.

02:01:06.692 --> 02:01:09.945
Do you think the Welsh
can't do better than that, Owen?

02:01:10.029 --> 02:01:13.365
Well, they've got a very good
bass section, mind,

02:01:14.117 --> 02:01:16.743
but no top tenors, that's for sure.

02:01:27.588 --> 02:01:31.633
Men of Harlech
stop your dreaming

02:01:32.051 --> 02:01:36.221
Can't you see
their spear points gleaming

02:01:36.556 --> 02:01:40.767
See their warrior pennants streaming

02:01:40.893 --> 02:01:44.396
To this battlefield

02:01:44.564 --> 02:01:45.605
Sing!

02:01:45.731 --> 02:01:49.109
Men of Harlech stand ye steady

02:01:49.235 --> 02:01:50.777
Come on, sing!

02:01:50.903 --> 02:01:53.822
It cannot be ever said ye

02:01:54.073 --> 02:01:58.410
For the battle were not ready

02:01:58.494 --> 02:02:01.621
Welshmen never yield

02:02:15.011 --> 02:02:19.139
The mighty force surrounding

02:02:19.348 --> 02:02:23.602
Men of Harlech on to glory

02:02:23.686 --> 02:02:27.606
This will ever be your story

02:02:27.690 --> 02:02:33.361
Keep these burning words before ye

02:02:33.446 --> 02:02:37.782
Welshmen will not yield

02:03:25.331 --> 02:03:27.415
At 100 yards!

02:03:29.001 --> 02:03:31.086
Volley fire! Present!

02:03:34.006 --> 02:03:36.841
Aim! Fire!

02:03:48.020 --> 02:03:50.313
Right, stand by. Lips dry?

02:03:51.607 --> 02:03:53.692
- Sergeant!
- Prepare!

02:03:59.031 --> 02:04:00.156
Now!

02:04:01.617 --> 02:04:03.201
Spit, boy, spit!

02:04:12.378 --> 02:04:13.920
Redoubt party!

02:04:14.922 --> 02:04:16.089
Fire!

02:04:21.512 --> 02:04:23.346
Volley by ranks!

02:04:23.431 --> 02:04:25.515
Front rank, fire!

02:04:25.599 --> 02:04:28.518
Second rank, fire!

02:04:28.602 --> 02:04:30.520
Third rank, fire!

02:04:30.604 --> 02:04:32.689
First rank, fire!

02:04:33.232 --> 02:04:35.525
Second rank, fire!

02:04:35.860 --> 02:04:38.153
Third rank, fire!

02:04:38.279 --> 02:04:40.447
First rank, fire!

02:04:40.948 --> 02:04:43.450
Second rank, fire!

02:04:43.534 --> 02:04:45.910
Third rank, fire!

02:04:46.746 --> 02:04:53.209
Fire! Fire!

02:04:56.547 --> 02:04:58.048
Cease firing!

02:05:45.971 --> 02:05:48.807
Three hours
and they haven't come again.

02:05:53.729 --> 02:05:55.271
Mr Chard, sir.

02:05:55.940 --> 02:05:59.651
The patrol's come back.
The Zulus have gone. All of them.

02:06:02.738 --> 02:06:04.322
It's a miracle!

02:06:05.825 --> 02:06:07.409
If it's a miracle, Colour Sergeant,

02:06:07.493 --> 02:06:10.829
it's a short chamber
Boxer-Henry.45 calibre miracle.

02:06:10.913 --> 02:06:13.998
And a bayonet, sir,
with some guts behind it.

02:06:17.628 --> 02:06:20.171
- Fall them in. Call the roll.
- Sir.

02:06:21.841 --> 02:06:23.716
Well, you did it.

02:06:23.801 --> 02:06:25.093
Me?

02:06:36.230 --> 02:06:37.772
- Abel?
- Sir.

02:06:38.774 --> 02:06:40.066
Adams?

02:06:42.903 --> 02:06:44.070
Adam?

02:06:49.660 --> 02:06:51.161
- Barry?
- Sir.

02:06:52.580 --> 02:06:54.998
- Beckett?
- He's wounded, sir.

02:06:55.082 --> 02:06:57.417
- He's dying, sir.
- It's sad.

02:06:58.878 --> 02:07:00.795
Keep your voices down.

02:07:02.673 --> 02:07:03.882
Byrne?

02:07:07.386 --> 02:07:09.179
- Camp?
- Sir.

02:07:11.140 --> 02:07:12.390
Chick?

02:07:17.188 --> 02:07:18.438
Cole?

02:07:21.984 --> 02:07:23.026
- Colin.
- Sir.

02:07:31.452 --> 02:07:34.162
- Who was left in here?
- I don't know.

02:07:36.248 --> 02:07:38.041
They had names, they had faces.
They were our men.

02:07:38.125 --> 02:07:40.585
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- Chard!

02:07:44.840 --> 02:07:46.174
All right.

02:07:46.258 --> 02:07:48.176
470 Davies?

02:07:54.391 --> 02:07:57.143
- 363 Davies?
- Sir.

02:07:59.897 --> 02:08:01.189
Well,

02:08:03.400 --> 02:08:05.485
you've fought your first action.

02:08:05.569 --> 02:08:08.446
Does everyone feel like this afterwards?

02:08:08.989 --> 02:08:10.657
How do you feel?

02:08:11.992 --> 02:08:13.159
Sick.

02:08:16.247 --> 02:08:19.123
Well, you have to be alive to feel sick.

02:08:19.500 --> 02:08:21.543
You asked me, I told you.

02:08:24.421 --> 02:08:25.463
There's something else.

02:08:28.551 --> 02:08:30.134
I feel ashamed.

02:08:33.931 --> 02:08:37.267
Was that how it was for you?
The first time?

02:08:39.103 --> 02:08:40.687
The first time?

02:08:42.398 --> 02:08:45.900
You think I could stand
this butcher's yard more than once?
