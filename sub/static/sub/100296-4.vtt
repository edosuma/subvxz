Previously onDeputy...

00:03.690 --> 00:05.123
BILL:
Sheriff Hollister.

00:05.170 --> 00:07.479
Still gettin' used to
the sound of that.

00:07.520 --> 00:08.999
LONDON: Sheriff Hollister
pushes the boundaries

00:09.050 --> 00:10.654
and may make him
unfit for office.

00:10.700 --> 00:12.133
_ This isn't
a political statement.

00:12.180 --> 00:13.659
But I'm canceling
this operation.

00:13.700 --> 00:14.917
You can't do this, Bill.

00:14.970 --> 00:16.312
The federal grants
we'll lose, millions!

00:16.360 --> 00:17.349
Not while I'm sheriff.

00:17.880 --> 00:18.744
[gunshot]

00:20.710 --> 00:23.406
WOMAN: Deputy Luna ended
his watch at 1743 hours.

00:23.450 --> 00:25.406
-MINNICK: Excuses.
-Excuse me?

00:25.460 --> 00:26.666
The reason you're here right now

00:26.720 --> 00:27.937
is because you weren't
present then.

00:27.980 --> 00:29.140
It's about those kids.

00:29.200 --> 00:30.679
Thrown into a system
with no way out.

00:30.720 --> 00:32.199
Camilla asked about her father.

00:32.240 --> 00:34.242
-You wanna try
talking to her?
-Yeah.

00:34.290 --> 00:36.201
We all get to go home
to our families tonight.

00:36.250 --> 00:37.854
Let's do that every single day.

00:37.900 --> 00:39.720
For each other and for Luna.

00:42.730 --> 00:44.254
["Cumbia" by Gavwi playing]

00:44.300 --> 00:46.348
Mi amor, quiero presentarte
a mi amigo

00:46.390 --> 00:48.563
El es un poquito loco...

00:50.260 --> 00:51.909
-[laughs]
-Yeah!

00:52.920 --> 00:54.433
This is for la sorpresa?

00:54.480 --> 00:55.742
Nope. Father/daughter.

00:56.570 --> 00:57.616
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

00:57.660 --> 00:59.048
It's supposed to be a waltz.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.055
Not anymore.

01:02.100 --> 01:03.749
What? I'm serious.

01:04.620 --> 01:06.440
-Whoo!
-[both laugh]

01:07.670 --> 01:08.978
-[turns volume down]
-Maggie...

01:09.020 --> 01:10.624
-[sighs]
-Come on.

01:10.670 --> 01:12.069
This is your quinceaera.

01:12.110 --> 01:13.930
This is your father
we're talking about.

01:14.330 --> 01:16.548
Sheriff Bill Hollister.

01:16.590 --> 01:18.592
Yeah, it's my quinceaera.

01:18.640 --> 01:20.983
And since I didn't even wanna
do any of this to begin with,

01:21.030 --> 01:22.429
he can just deal with it.

01:22.470 --> 01:24.370
Well, you're definitely
your father's daughter,

01:24.430 --> 01:25.988
I can tell you that.

01:26.040 --> 01:27.769
You know, and as much as
you keep complaining about it,

01:27.820 --> 01:29.469
it's an important part
of our heritage.

01:29.520 --> 01:30.646
I know. I know.

01:30.690 --> 01:32.294
I loved mine.

01:32.350 --> 01:34.341
And it's a great party.

01:35.050 --> 01:37.132
And we're so far behind
on planning it.

01:37.180 --> 01:38.613
We only have a couple of months

01:38.660 --> 01:40.218
to get the caterer,
and the, and the guest list.

01:40.270 --> 01:42.135
So, please just keep it easy
for your gringodad

01:42.180 --> 01:43.317
and choose something
a little more--

01:43.360 --> 01:44.440
Lame?

01:45.010 --> 01:46.409
I was gonna say "classic."

01:46.450 --> 01:47.929
-[turns volume up]
-He's gonna love it.

01:47.970 --> 01:49.141
Fine.

01:49.190 --> 01:50.794
I just wanna be there
when you tell him,

01:51.890 --> 01:54.450
'cause I wanna see his face!

01:54.500 --> 01:55.808
[laughs]

01:57.020 --> 01:58.157
BILL: You ready
for a new assignment?

01:58.200 --> 02:00.020
Yes, sir,
it's been three weeks.

02:00.460 --> 02:02.769
I'm not doing anybody any good
sittin' at home.

02:02.810 --> 02:04.152
BILL: I understand.

02:04.210 --> 02:06.633
And I know how much
Luna meant to you.

02:07.340 --> 02:08.648
So if you wanna slow down,

02:08.690 --> 02:10.419
I can always find you
something in the courts.

02:10.470 --> 02:12.609
I didn't join the department
to be a bailiff.

02:12.650 --> 02:14.379
Says here you're having
trouble sleeping.

02:16.220 --> 02:17.994
Increased general anxiety.

02:21.920 --> 02:23.308
Sounds like me.

02:24.400 --> 02:27.005
Look, I beat
my share of tests.

02:27.490 --> 02:29.799
I don't need a doc's opinion,
only yours.

02:29.840 --> 02:31.148
Are you okay?

02:31.190 --> 02:32.623
Everyone's carrying something.

02:32.670 --> 02:33.967
BILL: All right, then.

02:34.020 --> 02:35.317
JOSEPH: I wanna be back
on the streets.

02:35.370 --> 02:36.667
I can make a difference there.

02:37.370 --> 02:38.883
You know, balance out
the scales a little bit...

02:40.500 --> 02:41.489
for my people.

02:41.550 --> 02:42.801
They won't look
at you the same.

02:42.850 --> 02:44.067
Not with that badge
on your chest.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.018
JOSEPH: Some will.

02:46.030 --> 02:47.281
But I knew that signing up.

02:47.340 --> 02:48.329
BILL: Let's see.

02:49.030 --> 02:50.725
I'm assigning you
back on patrol.

02:50.770 --> 02:52.203
Lennox Station.

02:52.250 --> 02:53.330
I'm ready to put
all this behind me.

02:54.210 --> 02:55.905
BILL: It'll never be
behind you, Deputy.

02:56.520 --> 02:58.556
That's...
It's a part of you now.

02:58.610 --> 02:59.861
Forever.

03:00.570 --> 03:02.083
People make mistakes

03:02.130 --> 03:03.688
of trying to
get over things.

03:03.740 --> 03:04.786
Never works.

03:07.230 --> 03:09.300
Now how would you feel about
taking on a new trainee?

03:09.360 --> 03:10.702
Who you got in mind?

03:10.750 --> 03:12.399
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
she hates me.

03:12.450 --> 03:13.872
BILL:
Look at it this way, Deputy.

03:14.450 --> 03:15.621
He's yours to mold.

03:17.060 --> 03:19.187
But if he doesn't have it,
you can tell me.

03:20.540 --> 03:22.622
Did you read my brief
on the county supervisors
last night?

03:23.290 --> 03:25.497
-I skimmed it.
-That's a no.

03:25.550 --> 03:27.245
Okay, they like words
like "accountability,"

03:27.290 --> 03:30.202
"synergy," "open dialogue,"
and "next steps."

03:30.250 --> 03:31.945
Well, I don't
speak bureaucracy.

03:32.380 --> 03:33.984
Good afternoon,
Sheriff Hollister.

03:34.600 --> 03:36.249
Do you know
what oversight means?

03:36.820 --> 03:38.253
BILL:
Well, I guess it means

03:38.300 --> 03:40.689
you have ideas about
how I run this department.

03:40.740 --> 03:42.423
You have to remember,

03:42.480 --> 03:45.734
we were actually elected
by the people of Los Angeles.

03:45.790 --> 03:47.348
And I was sworn
to protect them,

03:47.400 --> 03:48.913
which is what I intend to do

03:48.960 --> 03:51.269
with the 86 and a half days
I have left.

03:51.310 --> 03:53.130
Of course,
we all want those days

03:53.180 --> 03:54.920
to be meaningful
and productive.

03:54.970 --> 03:57.222
I look forward to _
an open dialogue, counCIlman.

03:58.580 --> 04:00.059
COUNCILMAN 1:
Glad to hear that, Sheriff.

04:00.100 --> 04:01.977
Why don't we start
with this task force

04:02.020 --> 04:04.102
on human trafficking
that you've proposed?

04:04.150 --> 04:05.538
Oh, that's not a proposal.

04:05.590 --> 04:06.750
COUNCILMAN 2:
Well, since you called off

04:06.810 --> 04:08.892
the last joint operation
with ICE,

04:08.940 --> 04:11.898
our federal grant
has been revoked.

04:11.940 --> 04:14.408
I don't think we have the money
for this kind of operation.

04:14.470 --> 04:15.892
Well, is that right?

04:15.950 --> 04:17.292
COUNCILMAN 1:
We'll need time to review this.

04:17.860 --> 04:18.815
All right.

04:19.950 --> 04:23.738
Well, you got about
three, two, one.

04:27.350 --> 04:28.647
Go to the right.

04:30.530 --> 04:31.428

Hands where I can see 'em!

05:05.000 --> 05:06.160
We got two more in here.

05:06.870 --> 05:08.428
Detain these two.

05:08.480 --> 05:09.822
House is secure.
We're heading out back.

05:11.870 --> 05:13.519
Stop! Sheriff! Stop!

05:16.880 --> 05:18.359
Don't make me run,
jackass.

05:40.860 --> 05:42.339
Guns down. Guns down.

05:42.860 --> 05:44.157
Esta bien.

05:44.210 --> 05:45.199
Hey, guys.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.033
Take 'em along the side
of the house out front.

05:48.080 --> 05:50.036
Ven afuera.
Ven afuera, por favor.

06:16.890 --> 06:18.494
They're undocumented.

06:20.240 --> 06:22.549
They're victims,
and witnesses.

06:23.120 --> 06:24.633
We need to interview 'em.

06:25.250 --> 06:27.241
Sorry, but it looks like y'all
are going home empty-handed.

06:28.560 --> 06:29.902
CARTER: Deputy Ward, sir.

06:31.600 --> 06:32.464
Need you over here.

06:34.130 --> 06:35.518
Chin up, now.

06:35.560 --> 06:36.379
Tomorrow's a new day.

06:38.570 --> 06:39.992
[dog barking]

06:43.180 --> 06:44.875
She, uh, won't say
a word to me.

06:44.920 --> 06:46.000
Only wants to talk to you.

06:47.750 --> 06:48.614
I got this.

06:50.800 --> 06:51.960
Sheriff Hollister.

06:52.930 --> 06:54.181
I've heard of him.

06:55.760 --> 06:56.749
I need to talk to Bill.

07:07.030 --> 07:09.282
[indistinct
police radio chatter]

07:14.170 --> 07:15.774
BILL: Feds sticking
with the program?

07:15.820 --> 07:17.902
Ah, deep down
they love gettin' orders.

07:17.950 --> 07:19.474
What's so urgent?

07:19.520 --> 07:22.125
Well, we got a coyote
in custody over here.

07:22.700 --> 07:23.917
A few others
that reek of cartel.

07:23.960 --> 07:25.473
And about
20 trafficking victims.

07:25.530 --> 07:26.952
And there's this

07:27.010 --> 07:28.489
other not-so-minor issue

07:28.530 --> 07:29.781
that's gonna ring a bell.

07:45.200 --> 07:46.064
Help me.

07:49.640 --> 07:50.629
Arrest her.

08:07.870 --> 08:08.825
CADE: Hold up. Hold up.

08:15.750 --> 08:16.830
I'll be in touch.

08:16.880 --> 08:18.006
I'm sure you will.

08:19.580 --> 08:20.660
[engine starts]

08:22.850 --> 08:24.841
-[helicopter blades whirring]
-[indistinct radio chatter]

08:36.290 --> 08:38.019
What the hell
were you doing back there?

08:40.690 --> 08:41.907
Making a living.

08:43.260 --> 08:45.069
Well, how deep are you
in that mess?

08:46.040 --> 08:47.735
-Trafficking now?
-WOMAN: No!

08:47.780 --> 08:49.338
My family has a debt.

08:49.390 --> 08:50.209
I can explain.

08:51.480 --> 08:52.822
You better.

08:52.880 --> 08:54.086
You can't take me to jail.

08:55.700 --> 08:57.429
If they find me,
they'll kill me.

08:57.490 --> 08:58.787
You know that.

09:00.060 --> 09:01.220
I'm not taking you to jail.

09:03.230 --> 09:05.573
Good. We need a safe house.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.108
MAGGIE and PAULA:
[laughing] Si.

09:11.890 --> 09:13.710
-Hey, Dad.
-BILL: Hey.

09:13.770 --> 09:14.759
There you are.

09:14.810 --> 09:16.198
What, no call?

09:16.250 --> 09:18.115
BILL: I couldn't.
I got held up at the office

09:18.160 --> 09:20.594
and, in fact,

09:20.640 --> 09:23.245
I had to kinda bring
work home with me tonight.

09:23.650 --> 09:25.902
Paula, Maggie,
this is Valeria.

09:25.950 --> 09:27.121
An old friend of mine.

09:29.650 --> 09:30.730
Hi!

09:31.960 --> 09:33.302
Hey. Nice to meet you.

09:34.310 --> 09:36.471
BILL: We used to work
on a task force together.

09:36.530 --> 09:38.919
Paula, I've heard
so much about you.

09:39.490 --> 09:41.139
_ It's nice to
finally meet you, too.

09:42.010 --> 09:44.228
[speaking Spanish]

09:44.270 --> 09:46.147
-I can do that.
-Good idea.

09:46.190 --> 09:48.408
Wait, you speak Spanish now?

09:48.450 --> 09:49.929
Poco.
I've got to in this house.

09:51.460 --> 09:53.928
If you guys don't mind, uh,
Valeria and I,

09:53.980 --> 09:55.288
we need to talk shop.

09:55.330 --> 09:56.718
Super secret.

09:56.770 --> 09:57.634
Top secret.

09:58.770 --> 10:00.499
You got some 'splaining to do.
[kiss]

10:02.860 --> 10:05.158
Come on, Mags,
let's go upstairs

10:05.210 --> 10:06.598
and let's figure out
your quinceaeradresses.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.073
Oh, yeah, how's that going,
by the way?

10:08.120 --> 10:09.166
Oh, you'll see.

10:10.170 --> 10:11.512
Good night.

10:11.560 --> 10:14.734
Oh, Valeria, and you're
spending the night, yes?

10:14.780 --> 10:16.304
Well, if it's not
too much trouble.

10:17.480 --> 10:19.175
Guest room, down the hall.

10:19.960 --> 10:20.949
Thank you.

10:22.490 --> 10:23.616
And I'll see you in bed.

10:25.400 --> 10:26.310
Night.

10:30.710 --> 10:32.314
Just like old times, huh?

10:33.240 --> 10:34.969
Pretty damn far from it.

10:37.680 --> 10:38.624
You were my informant.

10:39.160 --> 10:40.195
Now you're...

10:40.810 --> 10:42.198
What are you exactly?

10:42.810 --> 10:43.981
A courier.

10:45.030 --> 10:46.201
I have no choice.

10:46.730 --> 10:47.719
Only money.

10:48.730 --> 10:50.209
They have men at the border,

10:50.250 --> 10:52.115
I drive through,
deliver the package,

10:52.170 --> 10:53.205
and then I come back home.

We worked Narcotics

It's a long time ago.

She was an informant?

12:43.280 --> 12:44.144
Yeah.

12:47.940 --> 12:50.101
So she's helped you and...

to discuss it...

No.

16:25.070 --> 16:27.015
Well, maybe just a little.

You should talk
to each other,

the kids,
and get back to me.

to feel that way anymore.

a little more.

of a workplace romance.

17:23.470 --> 17:26.030

my former profession,

17:26.080 --> 17:27.866
there was always
that added layer of,

"Is this person
I'm sleeping with a spy?"

it would be weird.

18:36.550 --> 18:38.108
I mean, you worked
with him, right?

18:38.160 --> 18:40.378

something loco.

undercover with your dad.

There was this drug deal
that was about to go down.

19:03.180 --> 19:04.909
And I told your father,
"Let me handle it."

19:06.100 --> 19:08.136
I was trying to
protect my brother.

19:08.190 --> 19:10.488
He hated that we were poor,
and he started dealing.

19:13.500 --> 19:14.489
So I confronted them.

19:16.110 --> 19:17.008
And?

19:17.500 --> 19:18.660
VALERIA: And...

19:20.020 --> 19:22.193
I found myself on
the receiving end of a fist.

19:26.030 --> 19:27.281
They beat me,

19:27.340 --> 19:28.898
wanting to know
where my brother was.

19:28.950 --> 19:30.941
And just when I thought
I was gonna die,

19:32.210 --> 19:33.518
your dad arrived.

19:34.120 --> 19:35.030
Terrible fight.

19:35.520 --> 19:36.600
They broke my nose,

19:37.950 --> 19:38.905
he got stabbed...

19:40.260 --> 19:41.693
but he did not give up.

19:43.790 --> 19:45.690
He saved my life
from those creeps.

19:46.350 --> 19:47.521
And he saved my brother, too.

that night.

19:51.580 --> 19:52.706
To the ER.

19:52.750 --> 19:54.308
And because I was his informant

19:54.360 --> 19:56.055
I couldn't go in and be seen.

20:59.340 --> 21:00.648

21:00.690 --> 21:02.464

21:03.470 --> 21:05.472

LONDON:
We have a lot of informants.

21:07.300 --> 21:08.995
We can't strike a deal
With everyone.

21:09.050 --> 21:11.564
It sets a dangerous precedent
with the department.

21:11.610 --> 21:12.656
Give it to one,

21:13.700 --> 21:15.088
they all want to leverage that.

21:15.140 --> 21:16.653
BILL: Well, not all.
Just this one.

21:17.180 --> 21:19.262
This informant helped us
with tons of drug cases

21:19.320 --> 21:20.139
over the years.

21:20.190 --> 21:21.441
Who is he?

21:21.490 --> 21:22.616
-BILL: It's a she.
-Hmm.

21:23.360 --> 21:24.577
And that shouldn't matter.

21:24.630 --> 21:26.188
But it always does,
doesn't it?

21:26.800 --> 21:27.664
You gonna help or not?

21:29.150 --> 21:30.196
How would you put this?

21:31.150 --> 21:32.287
You'll owe me one, Bill.

21:32.980 --> 21:34.197
Well, make it two.

21:35.330 --> 21:36.410
And I never forget, Jerry.

21:44.820 --> 21:46.947
So, you just wandered
into a cartel house

21:47.000 --> 21:48.342
full of cash and guns,

21:48.390 --> 21:50.119
with 20 people locked up
in a shed out back,

21:50.170 --> 21:52.172
and you had no idea
what was going on?

21:52.220 --> 21:53.118
MAN: NO.

21:53.180 --> 21:54.169
That's your story.

21:55.350 --> 21:56.339
All I said was...

21:57.270 --> 21:58.305
"Get me my lavwer."

22:00.660 --> 22:01.740
So his lavwer here yet?

22:04.410 --> 22:06.014

keep breaking down.

Running late.

22:14.850 --> 22:15.885
You good at math?

22:16.500 --> 22:17.762
Cartel lawyers are.

22:18.420 --> 22:20.729
Some high-grade calculus crap.

22:20.770 --> 22:22.374
The hell you talking about?

22:22.420 --> 22:24.468
BILL: _
Your lawyer's not just
figuring out his fee,

22:24.510 --> 22:25.818
or your bail,

22:25.860 --> 22:27.339
which won't be small.

22:27.380 --> 22:31.168
No, he... he's probably delayed
doing some ciphering.

22:31.210 --> 22:33.349

for the jefe.

22:33.960 --> 22:36.565
-I want my lawyer.
-BILL: Do you?

22:36.610 --> 22:39.078
'Cause he's wondering
if he wants you, I bet.

22:39.140 --> 22:41.358
I mean, you really worth
the time and effort,

22:42.090 --> 22:44.001
or is it easier just to
drive you out into the desert,

22:44.050 --> 22:45.176
put a bullet in your head,

22:45.230 --> 22:47.266
and let the buzzards
do their work?

22:47.320 --> 22:49.572
They call that a slq burial.

22:50.410 --> 22:51.570
Great name, huh?

22:51.630 --> 22:52.881
Hell of a way to go.

Now, let me go
find you that lawyer.

23:02.420 --> 23:03.284

23:03.330 --> 23:05.025

He's gonna go
straight to his boss,

23:08.250 --> 23:10.036
Kick him loose,

23:10.080 --> 23:11.684
-CADE: Okay.
-BISHOP: Sheriff.

23:11.730 --> 23:12.856
Got a text from London.

23:12.910 --> 23:14.252
He's got DHS,
wants to talk to you.

23:15.000 --> 23:15.989
That was fast.

23:16.780 --> 23:18.429
Holding a favor over you
is motivating.

23:19.090 --> 23:21.957
Sheriff, this is
Agent Marquez from DHS.

23:23.830 --> 23:25.081
The undersheriff_ tells me
you have a Witness

23:25.140 --> 23:26.744
who seeks cooperation.

23:26.790 --> 23:28.439
That's right.

23:28.490 --> 23:29.923
We can certainly make
arrangements for relocation,

23:29.970 --> 23:30.868

23:30.930 --> 23:32.136
But?

23:32.190 --> 23:33.316
_ We would need_
Significant information

23:33.360 --> 23:34.531
on the human trafficking.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.059
That's just our
main area of concern.

23:36.110 --> 23:37.441
How significant?

23:37.500 --> 23:38.922

both sides of the border.

23:38.980 --> 23:41.323
Shot callers.
Not just soldiers.

23:42.110 --> 23:45.238
So she delivers that,
and you give her a new life?

23:45.290 --> 23:46.848
Once I can determine
her information is credible,

23:47.770 --> 23:48.805
absolutely.

Just shut up and sit down.

All right, this is Vegas.

Stop lookin' around.

25:03.450 --> 25:05.532
I'm just working on
my observational intelligence.

25:07.020 --> 25:08.840
Did you have a TV
in your family room growing up?

25:09.890 --> 25:11.505
I didn't really watch TV.

25:11.550 --> 25:13.711
-I'm a big reader, though.
-MINNICK: Mm-hmm. Figures.

25:13.770 --> 25:15.897
All right, babyface,
this is your family room,

25:15.940 --> 25:17.202
and this bar right here?

25:18.120 --> 25:19.200
That's your TV.

25:20.380 --> 25:22.428
We come in after a shift
and gather around.

25:22.470 --> 25:24.256

How?

25:25.560 --> 25:26.424
Trust.

25:27.040 --> 25:28.564
Do your job,

25:28.610 --> 25:30.646
the right way,
every day out there,

25:30.700 --> 25:32.042
then you get to
walk in here.

25:33.790 --> 25:35.178
And when they see you,

25:35.220 --> 25:36.528
they see you as family.

25:39.490 --> 25:40.525
Like Luna.

25:42.410 --> 25:43.399
Damn straight.

25:46.450 --> 25:47.712
And like your father, too.

25:50.150 --> 25:51.321
Yeah, I'm gonna
make 'em proud.

25:52.980 --> 25:54.060
Yeah, we'll see.

Thank you.

It is the least I could do.

You did have to tackle

detailed information _
about the criminal organization

26:15.740 --> 26:17.048

26:17.090 --> 26:18.569
Once we have vetted
that information

26:18.620 --> 26:19.689

what you needed?

28:48.680 --> 28:50.193
It's not what I needed.

It's what she needed.

But, yeah.

I wanted to give you all

the authority to execute?

29:01.910 --> 29:02.899
Oh, I disagree.

29:03.690 --> 29:05.385
She gave me the authority.

29:05.430 --> 29:08.046
And so did she.
And this little boy.

29:13.180 --> 29:14.522
You talk about oversight.

But you don't get to see
what we see out there.

a second chance.

I don't think about budgets
or bottom lines.

31:35.980 --> 31:37.231
I told them nothing.

31:40.330 --> 31:41.490
I wanna believe you, Ernesto.

31:43.810 --> 31:44.674
I really do.

31:47.680 --> 31:48.590
But Jorge...

he thinks you're lying.

31:51.820 --> 31:52.775
[gun cocks]

31:57.610 --> 32:00.477
The only one who could have told
them anything is that perra.

What's her name?

32:06.440 --> 32:07.657

to talk earlier.

33:50.760 --> 33:51.931
I'm here to listen now.

33:54.720 --> 33:57.462

BILL: Hey.

34:06.080 --> 34:07.251
Hey! Stay with me.

34:27.320 --> 34:28.969
I don't suppose you have
anything to say

34:29.020 --> 34:30.362
before your fancy lavwer
shows up

34:30.410 --> 34:31.798
and we all play our parts.

34:31.850 --> 34:34.751
Hello.
My name is Inigo Montoya.

34:35.420 --> 34:36.409
You killed my father.

34:37.770 --> 34:38.976
Prepare to die.

34:50.470 --> 34:52.779
BILL: Um, excuse me.
Thank you.

35:06.710 --> 35:08.268
I always wondered
if you were okay.

35:11.370 --> 35:12.268
I felt guilty.

35:15.370 --> 35:16.803
I wanted closure, but, uh...

35:17.500 --> 35:18.489
not like this.

35:19.980 --> 35:21.675
I get a chance
at a new life, thanks to you.

35:23.860 --> 35:25.634
The one where I made
the right choices.

35:27.030 --> 35:28.634
BILL: All our choices
got us here.

35:30.170 --> 35:31.512
And now you get to
start again.

35:32.300 --> 35:33.460
[Valeria sighs]

35:33.520 --> 35:34.999
Just do me one last favor.

35:36.480 --> 35:37.697
Don't forget about me.

35:38.740 --> 35:41.300
Legally speaking, I have to.

35:44.400 --> 35:45.480
But I won't.

35:49.660 --> 35:50.740
You'll always be a part of me.

35:53.890 --> 35:54.754
BILL: Same here.

35:57.060 --> 35:58.584
I got the scars to prove it.

36:16.730 --> 36:18.812
You called in the tip
on that house, didn't you?

36:18.870 --> 36:20.383
Wasn't just meant to be.

36:22.870 --> 36:24.041
Oh, but it was.

36:28.270 --> 36:29.567
Valeria.

36:30.050 --> 36:31.699
I am gonna miss
that name, you know.

36:34.230 --> 36:35.185
Me, too.

Thank you for coming down.

37:17.320 --> 37:18.924
I hope I didn't
screw up any plans.

37:18.970 --> 37:20.619
Sir, you know I would have
told you if you had.

37:20.670 --> 37:22.274
True. You would.

37:22.320 --> 37:25.323
Took my trainee out
for his first big boy drink.

37:26.200 --> 37:27.235

That's what this is about?

37:32.590 --> 37:33.761
Partly.

Well, what's the other part?

37:38.290 --> 37:39.109
[London sighs]

37:40.950 --> 37:42.508
I wouldn't have put
you and Joseph together.

37:43.820 --> 37:45.947
Especially after what happened
with Deputy Luna.

37:47.610 --> 37:48.645
Well, I'm moving past that.

37:49.870 --> 37:51.519

for both of us.

LONDON:
If Harris works out.

37:55.140 --> 37:56.437
Given his personal connection
with the sheriff,

37:56.490 --> 37:57.912
if he doesn't work out,

37:57.970 --> 37:59.176
the blowback falls on you.

38:01.140 --> 38:02.220
He will work out.

38:03.060 --> 38:05.927
Well, if he doesn't,
I'm here to help.

38:05.970 --> 38:08.404
Let me know if there's any
issues or conflicts of interest

38:08.460 --> 38:09.495
you see with Harris.

38:09.540 --> 38:10.620
Or Sheriff Hollister.

38:11.980 --> 38:13.015
You want me to spy?

38:14.240 --> 38:15.798
If that means
looking out for yourself,

38:15.850 --> 38:16.896
the good of the department,

38:18.200 --> 38:19.246
and that promotion
you worked so hard for...

38:19.900 --> 38:21.117
yes.

38:21.160 --> 38:23.071
That's exactly
what I want you to do.

38:23.690 --> 38:24.816
