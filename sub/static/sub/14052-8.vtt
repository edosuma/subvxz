WEBVTT

00:20.640 --> 00:23.000
There we are.

00:23.040 --> 00:27.320
-I enjoyed today, Colin. Thanks.

00:23.040 --> 00:27.320
-Me too.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.600
Better go and rest up if I'm going to have any energy

00:29.640 --> 00:32.280
-for this dance tonight. -Well, you don't have

00:29.640 --> 00:32.280
to come, you know.

00:32.320 --> 00:34.440
-I wouldn't miss it for the world!

00:35.320 --> 00:36.720
See you later, Colin.

00:42.280 --> 00:44.720
Well

00:44.760 --> 00:46.560
I meant to. I planned to,

00:46.600 --> 00:48.960
but when it got down to it, I didn't have the courage.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.640
Colin! We're none of us getting younger!

00:52.320 --> 00:53.680
I'll do it tonight.

00:55.120 --> 00:59.440
-Bloody 14 down.

00:59.480 --> 01:02.160
Orchestra, anagram of carthorse.

01:02.200 --> 01:05.040
-Of course it is!

01:07.920 --> 01:09.680
Oh, Jim!

01:09.720 --> 01:12.600
My computer's lost the Wi-Fi signal.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.960
Can you do that thing that you do?

01:15.000 --> 01:18.960
Sorry, Pam! It's just that I wanted to

01:15.000 --> 01:18.960
video-call Ben tonight.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.480
Oh, well, I'm sure Jim will be only too happy

01:19.000 --> 01:22.480
to help you out.

01:22.520 --> 01:23.600
I won't be long.

01:24.560 --> 01:25.920
Right then. Emma.

01:30.400 --> 01:33.840
-You have got to tell her. -We can't do this, not here.

01:33.880 --> 01:36.640
You've got until the dance tonight to tell her.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.520
Otherwise, I swear I'll tell her myself.

01:45.240 --> 01:48.200
Well, then you'll have to get used to shiny trousers!

01:48.240 --> 01:51.440
BEN ON COMPUTER: <i> I love</i> <i>that you can still nag me</i>

01:48.240 --> 01:51.440
<i>from 2,000 miles away.</i>

01:51.480 --> 01:54.560
I'm your mother, I can nag you

01:51.480 --> 01:54.560
from any distance!

01:54.600 --> 01:58.240
<i>-I know that,</i> <i>that's the problem!</i>

02:33.720 --> 02:36.160
Face like a smacked arse again.

02:38.160 --> 02:39.520
I'll get us some drinks.

02:51.840 --> 02:55.120
Well, she said she was but, uh, it's gone 6:00.

02:55.160 --> 02:56.800
-Well, it's Emma.

02:56.840 --> 02:58.040
She said she'd be here tonight,

02:58.080 --> 02:59.960
but I just tried her mobile, she didn't answer.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.760
-Well, maybe I should go and check on her.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.360
-Oh, not since this afternoon.

03:05.400 --> 03:07.680
-She's not answering her phone.

03:05.400 --> 03:07.680
-Oh, I'm sure she's fine.

03:07.720 --> 03:10.840
-She'll be getting ready. -No. Jim's right,

03:07.720 --> 03:10.840
we should go and check.

03:10.880 --> 03:13.240
-Come on, we'll go together. -We'll be back

03:10.880 --> 03:13.240
in five minutes.

03:16.880 --> 03:20.680
That's so sweet. He really cares about her, doesn't he?

03:21.560 --> 03:22.880
Who

03:23.640 --> 03:24.920
Or Jim?

03:30.760 --> 03:33.520
Emma Emma?

03:33.560 --> 03:35.200
I can see her. Open the door.

03:36.320 --> 03:38.080
-It's locked! -Out of the way.

04:24.040 --> 04:25.960
CAMILLE: So, you were the last person to see her?

04:33.760 --> 04:35.640
Thank you, I have all the questions I need.

04:36.800 --> 04:38.760
Dr Emma Redding. Retired.

04:38.800 --> 04:42.080
She made arrangements to go to a dance this evening,

04:38.800 --> 04:42.080
but she didn't show up.

04:42.120 --> 04:45.600
Two male residents came to her room after 6:00 p.m.

04:45.640 --> 04:47.560
They saw the body through the shutters,

04:47.600 --> 04:50.720
so they broke the door down but she was dead before

04:47.600 --> 04:50.720
they got to her.

04:56.120 --> 04:58.000
-Yes.

04:59.240 --> 05:03.120
-It looks like an overdose.

05:03.160 --> 05:05.200
Anyone know what Propentin is?

05:05.240 --> 05:07.720
-Ah, yes, they're sleeping pills.

05:07.760 --> 05:10.600
I had an aunt. She was kind of highly strung.

05:07.760 --> 05:10.600
That's what she took.

05:11.800 --> 05:13.920
-We haven't found one yet.

05:15.400 --> 05:18.040
Well, we know she didn't have a sweet tooth.

05:18.080 --> 05:21.000
She didn't eat her dessert but she did eat most

05:18.080 --> 05:21.000
of her main meal.

05:22.520 --> 05:26.160
So, three possibilities. Suicide, accident or murder.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.200
Well, accident is unlikely.

05:28.240 --> 05:30.040
-'Cause if you're taking

05:28.240 --> 05:30.040
sleeping pills,

05:30.080 --> 05:32.000
you'd have to take the whole packet for a fatal overdose

05:32.040 --> 05:34.320
and you can't do that accidentally.

05:34.360 --> 05:35.960
-Yes, sir.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.440
So that just leaves us with suicide or murder.

05:40.600 --> 05:42.800
Well, it's pretty obvious if you consider the evidence.

05:42.840 --> 05:45.480
-The dress.

05:45.520 --> 05:47.440
HUMPHREY: The dress? CAMILLE: Mmm-hmm.

05:47.480 --> 05:49.320
Well, if she was going to take her own life,

05:49.360 --> 05:52.400
why get out a special dress like this and not put it on?

05:53.680 --> 05:56.000
People who commit suicide prepare for it.

05:56.040 --> 05:59.120
What clothes to wear, what time of the day,

05:56.040 --> 05:59.120
it's a ritual.

05:59.160 --> 06:02.000
Why get out a dress like this if it's not part of the plan?

06:03.600 --> 06:05.560
You know what, Camille? Normally I would

06:03.600 --> 06:05.560
agree with you,

06:05.600 --> 06:09.320
but if this isn't a suicide, I don't think it's a murder,

06:05.600 --> 06:09.320
either.

06:09.360 --> 06:11.360
When you consider the evidence.

06:11.400 --> 06:14.080
And what evidence would that be?

06:14.120 --> 06:17.400
The door. It has a latch-lock

06:14.120 --> 06:17.400
and a bolt.

06:19.680 --> 06:22.560
Both were clearly broken when the residents

06:19.680 --> 06:22.560
forced it open. See?

06:22.600 --> 06:24.440
And I've been looking. There's no other way

06:24.480 --> 06:27.040
into the room other than through that door.

06:27.080 --> 06:30.320
And as the door was locked, how did the killer get out?

06:30.360 --> 06:33.120
-So, Dr Redding

06:30.360 --> 06:33.120
was found dead

06:33.160 --> 06:35.200
in a room locked from the inside

06:33.160 --> 06:35.200
and no sign of a struggle,

06:35.240 --> 06:36.720
an empty packet of sleeping pills beside her,

06:36.760 --> 06:39.040
and no possibility of anyone else

06:36.760 --> 06:39.040
being in here.

06:39.080 --> 06:40.960
Or in other words, if it looks like a duck,

06:41.000 --> 06:42.800
walks like a duck and quacks like a duck...

06:42.840 --> 06:44.400
-Exactly.

06:44.440 --> 06:45.480
She killed herself.

06:46.800 --> 06:47.920
But then there's the dress.

07:04.560 --> 07:05.760
Thank you.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.080
Mr and Mrs Chandler.

07:10.120 --> 07:13.880
-Judith Musgrove. Colin Campbell.

07:10.120 --> 07:13.880
-Good evening.

07:13.920 --> 07:17.160
Sylvaine tells us that you were close

07:13.920 --> 07:17.160
to Dr Redding?

07:17.200 --> 07:19.320
So, can any of you tell me what kind of doctor she was?

07:19.360 --> 07:21.400
Of course. She was a surgeon.

07:21.440 --> 07:24.840
And then she worked in the cosmetic

07:21.440 --> 07:24.840
industry before she retired.

07:24.880 --> 07:26.760
Mmm-hmm. I see.

07:26.800 --> 07:29.560
We would like to get an idea of

07:26.800 --> 07:29.560
Emma's state of mind

07:29.600 --> 07:31.720
over the last few days and weeks.

07:31.760 --> 07:35.600
Emma's never been happier, and we all know why.

07:35.640 --> 07:36.680
Don't we, Colin?

07:38.720 --> 07:42.920
Emma and I, we'd been, um,

07:38.720 --> 07:42.920
stepping out.

07:42.960 --> 07:47.280
We went to a concert today, in a church in Honore.

07:47.320 --> 07:51.280
Emma loved choral music, and we had

07:47.320 --> 07:51.280
a marvellous time.

07:51.320 --> 07:53.960
When you got back, how would you

07:51.320 --> 07:53.960
describe her mood?

07:54.000 --> 07:56.320
A little tired, but good.

07:56.360 --> 07:58.880
Content? -I'd say so.

07:58.920 --> 08:01.600
She was excited about the dance

07:58.920 --> 08:01.600
and looking forward

08:01.640 --> 08:03.040
to speaking to her son.

08:03.080 --> 08:07.080
He lives in New York. I know she misses him...

08:03.080 --> 08:07.080
Missed him.

08:07.120 --> 08:10.440
They were always speaking to each other on the computer,

08:07.120 --> 08:10.440
you know.

08:10.480 --> 08:12.760
That's right. Her son is called Ben.

08:12.800 --> 08:16.200
They were chatting when I brought dinner to her earlier,

08:12.800 --> 08:16.200
around 5:30.

08:16.240 --> 08:18.840
HUMPHREY: <i> Did you hear</i> <i>what they were talking about?</i>

08:16.240 --> 08:18.840
SYLVAINE: <i> Not really.</i>

08:20.160 --> 08:22.320
And you all met her here, on Saint Marie?

08:22.360 --> 08:25.160
Well, no, Pam and I first came across Emma

08:22.360 --> 08:25.160
in the '90s.

08:25.200 --> 08:29.920
I was in medical supplies, and my company had a contract

08:25.200 --> 08:29.920
with her hospital.

08:29.960 --> 08:33.400
Bit of a coincidence, isn't it,

08:29.960 --> 08:33.400
her ending up here?

08:33.440 --> 08:36.560
Well, hardly. It was my suggestion

08:33.440 --> 08:36.560
she came out here.

08:38.880 --> 08:42.080
She had terrible arthritis in her right ankle,

08:42.120 --> 08:45.040
that's why she took early retirement and also why

08:42.120 --> 08:45.040
she came out here

08:45.080 --> 08:47.240
because the sunshine helped with the pain.

08:48.360 --> 08:49.600
CAMILLE: Was she in much pain?

08:50.640 --> 08:52.960
I suspect more than she let on.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.560
But she rarely complained.

08:55.600 --> 08:58.360
And you were expecting her at the dance this evening?

08:58.400 --> 09:01.600
Yes. That's why I was worried when she didn't turn up.

09:01.640 --> 09:05.400
She told me she wouldn't miss it

09:01.640 --> 09:05.400
for the world.

09:05.440 --> 09:08.720
It's possible we'll need formal statements from

09:05.440 --> 09:08.720
you all tomorrow,

09:08.760 --> 09:11.080
but for the moment, thank you for waiting behind.

09:18.880 --> 09:21.960
She was happy, excited to go to

09:18.880 --> 09:21.960
a dance this evening,

09:22.000 --> 09:24.280
surrounded by friends,

09:24.320 --> 09:27.280
not exactly the profile of someone

09:24.320 --> 09:27.280
who's about to commit suicide.

09:27.320 --> 09:30.560
Yes. In other words, if it looks like a duck,

09:30.600 --> 09:32.920
walks like a duck, quacks like a duck,

09:32.960 --> 09:36.840
it's looking more and more unlikely

09:32.960 --> 09:36.840
that it is, in fact, a duck.

10:42.280 --> 10:44.200
Question!

10:44.240 --> 10:47.000
If you wanted to poison someone or give them

10:44.240 --> 10:47.000
an overdose or something,

10:47.040 --> 10:49.080
but you didn't really want them to know

10:47.040 --> 10:49.080
what you were doing,

10:49.120 --> 10:53.160
which, of course, you wouldn't, how would you go

10:49.120 --> 10:53.160
about disguising it?

10:53.200 --> 10:56.280
-And you'd need a food

10:53.200 --> 10:56.280
with a strong flavour,

10:56.320 --> 10:58.400
something that assaulted their taste buds,

10:58.440 --> 11:01.240
-rendered them inefficient. Something like...

10:58.440 --> 11:01.240
-Curry.

11:01.280 --> 11:04.440
-Chicken curry.

11:04.480 --> 11:09.320
See, that's why her main meal was mostly eaten when her

11:04.480 --> 11:09.320
dessert wasn't even touched.

11:09.360 --> 11:12.280
How could it be? She was already dead.

11:12.320 --> 11:17.080
You were right, Camille. This isn't suicide.

11:12.320 --> 11:17.080
It's murder.

11:17.120 --> 11:19.720
But if the killer poisoned her food,

11:17.120 --> 11:19.720
they left the sleeping pills

11:19.760 --> 11:21.960
and the water to make it look

11:19.760 --> 11:21.960
like a suicide.

11:24.360 --> 11:26.280
Leaving the door locked and bolted from the inside?

11:27.360 --> 11:29.280
Okay...

11:29.320 --> 11:33.680
Let's just, uh, park that in the "still to be established"

11:29.320 --> 11:33.680
column for the moment.

11:33.720 --> 11:36.800
But if it is murder...

11:36.840 --> 11:39.320
We'd need to interview her friends

11:36.840 --> 11:39.320
again, and the staff.

11:39.360 --> 11:42.040
Then let's do that. Dwayne, background checks,

11:42.080 --> 11:44.640
finish checking through the victim's

11:42.080 --> 11:44.640
personal possessions.

11:44.680 --> 11:48.400
Fidel, chase up the lab results, get toxicology to

11:44.680 --> 11:48.400
look into the curry,

11:48.440 --> 11:50.440
and we need her autopsy booked in

11:48.440 --> 11:50.440
as soon as possible.

11:50.480 --> 11:52.880
I want to know what poison was in that curry.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.040
Come on, Camille!

11:58.600 --> 12:02.520
We need to get back in the victim's room again,

11:58.600 --> 12:02.520
we must be missing something.

12:02.560 --> 12:06.120
If she was murdered, there has to be

12:02.560 --> 12:06.120
another way out.

12:08.520 --> 12:11.480
The Chandlers, Pam and Jim, there was just

12:08.520 --> 12:11.480
a little something

12:11.520 --> 12:13.200
going on between them, when he talked

12:11.520 --> 12:13.200
about the victim.

12:13.240 --> 12:16.080
It wasn't much, it was just the way

12:13.240 --> 12:16.080
she looked at him.

12:16.120 --> 12:20.080
What was that? It was jealousy, maybe.

12:16.120 --> 12:20.080
Something more sinister.

12:24.600 --> 12:27.120
Sorry. I should've called first.

12:30.080 --> 12:31.120
Humph?

12:32.360 --> 12:34.640
-Well, say something. -Yes. Right. Uh...

12:34.680 --> 12:37.360
-Maybe ask me

12:34.680 --> 12:37.360
what I'm doing here?

12:37.400 --> 12:41.040
Good. Yes, that's the one. Excellent!

12:37.400 --> 12:41.040
What are you doing here?

12:41.080 --> 12:43.560
The board sent me to Martinique for a week.

12:43.600 --> 12:46.840
I knew that you were only an hour away and I...

12:46.880 --> 12:49.240
-Should've phoned. -Yes.

12:50.840 --> 12:53.680
-Sorry. Uh, Camille,

12:50.840 --> 12:53.680
this is Sally.

12:54.520 --> 12:57.000
My wife... My ex-wife.

12:57.040 --> 12:59.280
How's that work?

12:57.040 --> 12:59.280
-Pleased to meet you.

13:01.880 --> 13:03.240
-All good! All good! -Yes!

13:03.280 --> 13:07.680
You know, given the circumstances, anyway!

13:07.720 --> 13:10.720
-Well, I'll leave you and... -Oh, no, no, no! Of course,

13:07.720 --> 13:10.720
you're working!

13:10.760 --> 13:14.120
But, um... Maybe we could meet later?

13:14.160 --> 13:16.000
Uh, yes. Okay.

13:16.040 --> 13:17.800
7:00? -Absolutely.

13:18.760 --> 13:22.080
Which? -Oh, 6:30.

13:22.120 --> 13:26.360
-There's a bar on the harbour.

13:22.120 --> 13:26.360
Catherine's?

13:28.200 --> 13:30.800
All right. I'll be there.

13:32.920 --> 13:34.040
I'm sorry to intrude.

13:36.080 --> 13:37.160
Bye.

13:43.040 --> 13:46.440
-Yes, fine. Never better.

13:53.680 --> 13:54.920
Of course! Of course!

14:04.600 --> 14:09.640
Okay, so, the kitchen prepared two room service

14:04.600 --> 14:09.640
meals yesterday,

14:09.680 --> 14:11.360
both chicken curry.

14:11.400 --> 14:14.480
And Sylvaine took one of them to Judith Musgrove

14:11.400 --> 14:14.480
in her room,

14:14.520 --> 14:18.120
and the other she delivered to Emma Redding.

14:18.160 --> 14:20.800
Sylvaine doesn't think anyone could have

14:18.160 --> 14:20.800
tampered with the food

14:20.840 --> 14:22.360
while she was delivering it,

14:22.400 --> 14:25.160
and as at least one other guest

14:22.400 --> 14:25.160
had the same meal,

14:25.200 --> 14:27.520
it couldn't have been tampered with in the kitchen.

14:27.560 --> 14:30.320
-Yes, every word. Go on.

14:32.320 --> 14:35.520
CAMILLE: <i> At 5:45 p.m.,</i> <i>Sylvaine collected</i>

14:32.320 --> 14:35.520
<i>the empty plates</i>

14:35.560 --> 14:36.880
<i>from outside Judith's room,</i>

14:36.920 --> 14:39.720
<i>but Dr Redding</i> <i>hadn't put hers out.</i>

14:39.760 --> 14:40.960
Not surprising as she was almost

14:41.000 --> 14:43.200
certainly dead by then.

14:43.240 --> 14:45.720
So Sylvaine is the last person

14:43.240 --> 14:45.720
to see the victim alive

14:45.760 --> 14:48.720
and she's the only person who could

14:45.760 --> 14:48.720
have doctored the curry...

14:50.080 --> 14:52.160
So what if she's our killer?

14:54.320 --> 14:55.400
Sir?

14:58.360 --> 15:00.800
Why don't you take some time off?

15:05.840 --> 15:09.360
Yes. Two room service meals, both of them chicken curry.

15:09.400 --> 15:12.240
The other one fine, so it couldn't have been tampered

15:09.400 --> 15:12.240
with in the kitchen.

15:12.280 --> 15:15.280
Manager adamant it never left her sight,

15:12.280 --> 15:15.280
so maybe she's our killer.

15:15.320 --> 15:17.280
Why do you suppose she didn't phone?

15:17.320 --> 15:18.320
-Sally.

15:20.800 --> 15:21.840
Because she was afraid

15:21.880 --> 15:23.160
you would tell her not to come.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.080
Excuse me.

15:28.920 --> 15:29.960
Hello?

15:32.720 --> 15:34.360
Dwayne

15:38.560 --> 15:40.240
Is everything all right, Mr Witton?

15:41.520 --> 15:44.400
Yep, just getting some air.

15:49.720 --> 15:50.840
Thank you.

15:51.680 --> 15:52.680
Uh...

15:54.840 --> 15:57.320
-Here.

15:57.360 --> 15:59.640
The only way in or out of the chalet is

15:57.360 --> 15:59.640
through this door,

15:59.680 --> 16:02.400
which was locked and bolted from the inside.

15:59.680 --> 16:02.400
It's impossible.

16:02.440 --> 16:04.840
That was Dwayne. There were three entries

16:04.880 --> 16:06.840
in the victim's diary for yesterday.

16:06.880 --> 16:09.960
-The concert with Mr Campbell, the dance...

16:10.000 --> 16:12.520
And a note to meet Judith Musgrove at 3:00 p.m.

16:12.560 --> 16:14.880
Judith Musgrove. We spoke to her

16:12.560 --> 16:14.880
last night, didn't we?

16:14.920 --> 16:17.520
-Yes, we did. -I wonder why she didn't feel

16:14.920 --> 16:17.520
the need to mention it then.

16:23.280 --> 16:26.960
COLIN: 14 points! JUDITH: Mmm! Mmm-hmm!

16:27.000 --> 16:30.120
Miss Musgrove. Can we have a word, please?

16:30.160 --> 16:32.720
-Of course. -I'd better make

16:30.160 --> 16:32.720
myself scarce.

16:32.760 --> 16:35.000
No, stay, I'm sure it won't take very long.

16:35.040 --> 16:36.800
How can I help?

16:36.840 --> 16:40.600
You had an appointment to meet Dr Redding

16:36.840 --> 16:40.600
yesterday afternoon at 3:00.

16:40.640 --> 16:44.840
I'm a retired solicitor. Emma made an appointment

16:40.640 --> 16:44.840
to see me about her will.

16:45.320 --> 16:46.720
She did?

16:46.760 --> 16:48.840
She changed her will just before she died?

16:48.880 --> 16:52.680
Actually, she didn't. That's why I didn't

16:48.880 --> 16:52.680
mention it last night.

16:52.720 --> 16:55.160
Everything looks absolutely in order.

16:55.200 --> 16:58.560
-Nothing that needs to be altered.

16:55.200 --> 16:58.560
-Oh, good.

16:58.600 --> 17:02.480
Everything was left to her husband,

16:58.600 --> 17:02.480
unless he predeceased her,

17:02.520 --> 17:06.680
in which case, her estate would go

17:02.520 --> 17:06.680
straight to her son, Ben.

17:06.720 --> 17:09.280
Her husband died a few years ago.

17:09.320 --> 17:10.680
And I was able to tell her

17:10.720 --> 17:12.560
not to worry about it.

17:12.600 --> 17:15.600
Her son would still inherit on her death.

17:15.640 --> 17:17.720
Did she say why she felt the need

17:15.640 --> 17:17.720
to check her will?

17:17.760 --> 17:20.720
-No, she didn't. -And how was she

17:17.760 --> 17:20.720
when you were with her?

17:20.760 --> 17:24.920
I thought she was pre-occupied.

17:20.760 --> 17:24.920
Worried, even.

17:27.320 --> 17:31.080
I'm sorry, I should've told you all this yesterday.

17:27.320 --> 17:31.080
Shouldn't I?

17:35.600 --> 17:37.560
I'm sorry, but I don't understand

17:35.600 --> 17:37.560
what the problem is.

17:37.600 --> 17:39.960
What's going on? It's like the fifth time I've called.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.600
My inspector's waiting for those results.

17:43.160 --> 17:44.640
No, I'll hold.

17:58.440 --> 18:00.720
Finding out what happened to Dr Redding?

18:00.760 --> 18:03.560
-It's, uh, Mr... -Witton. David Witton.

18:03.600 --> 18:07.720
-Of course.

18:03.600 --> 18:07.720
Everyone knew Emma.

18:11.200 --> 18:12.360
DAVID: Well, not really.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.720
I've only been here six months.

18:15.760 --> 18:19.960
-Truth is, I'm still finding my feet.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.360
Just after a bit of gossip.

18:22.640 --> 18:24.240
It's like currency in here.

19:01.720 --> 19:04.920
CAMILLE: Well, thank you very much for your help,

19:01.720 --> 19:04.920
Mr Redding.

19:04.960 --> 19:08.840
No, no. Of course. As soon as we have any developments,

19:04.960 --> 19:08.840
we'll let you know. Bye.

19:11.680 --> 19:13.840
He and his mother were clearly very close.

19:13.880 --> 19:16.120
He said he only spoke to her for a few minutes yesterday,

19:16.160 --> 19:20.000
-but she seemed her normal self.

19:20.040 --> 19:23.000
And yet she was worried when she went through her

19:20.040 --> 19:23.000
will, so what changed?

19:23.040 --> 19:25.200
And why did she need a solicitor to look at it?

19:25.240 --> 19:29.160
Could it be a coincidence that Emma got her will checked

19:25.240 --> 19:29.160
the same day she was murdered?

19:29.200 --> 19:32.400
No. No way. It's connected. But why?

19:32.440 --> 19:35.440
Background checks throw anything up?

19:32.440 --> 19:35.440
-Sir.

19:35.480 --> 19:38.640
We have Colin Campbell. He was a captain

19:35.480 --> 19:38.640
in the army.

19:38.680 --> 19:41.000
Divorced from his wife five years ago,

19:38.680 --> 19:41.000
moved to Saint Marie.

19:41.040 --> 19:43.880
He was in a relationship with Dr Redding. Everyone said

19:41.040 --> 19:43.880
they were inseparable.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.360
-Judith.

19:48.400 --> 19:51.400
-FIDEL: Yeah, she's a

19:48.400 --> 19:51.400
retired solicitor.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.320
She's the home's longest-serving resident.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.560
No family, never married. But by all accounts,

19:55.600 --> 19:57.520
-she's a very good friend of the victim.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.520
-Hmm.

19:57.560 --> 20:00.960
-Jim and Pam Chandler, sir.

20:02.680 --> 20:04.880
They're old friends of Emma's. Or rather he is.

20:04.920 --> 20:07.400
They worked together back in the UK. Nothing showing

20:04.920 --> 20:07.400
for any of them.

20:07.440 --> 20:10.000
There was someone else we saw at the home.

20:10.040 --> 20:12.400
David Witton. Do you have anything on him?

20:12.440 --> 20:15.280
Yes. David Witton. Now, he's a retired teacher.

20:15.320 --> 20:17.600
He only came out to the island about six months ago.

20:17.640 --> 20:19.640
But by all accounts, he's a bit of a loner,

20:17.640 --> 20:19.640
you know? Doesn't really mix much.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.960
-Right. Nothing on file.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.600
But I rang my mother, because she's very

20:25.000 --> 20:26.600
good friends

20:26.640 --> 20:28.080
with Sylvaine's family.

20:28.120 --> 20:30.000
She told me Sylvaine's married,

20:28.120 --> 20:30.000
has a couple of kids,

20:30.040 --> 20:32.320
is involved in the local church and...

20:32.360 --> 20:34.640
Well, she just laughed when I asked if she

20:32.360 --> 20:34.640
could be a killer.

20:34.680 --> 20:37.840
And yet, if it was the curry that poisoned Emma...

20:37.880 --> 20:40.280
Sylvaine is the only person who ever had access to it.

20:41.480 --> 20:42.760
FIDEL: Honore Police Station.

20:43.960 --> 20:46.360
It's Dwayne. Yes, go on.

20:55.400 --> 20:57.640
You've been very helpful, sir. This is great.

20:57.680 --> 21:01.720
Thank you very much. Bye-bye.

21:01.760 --> 21:04.720
-I found these

21:01.760 --> 21:04.720
architect's drawings

21:04.760 --> 21:07.120
for the refurbishment of this bar in the

21:04.760 --> 21:07.120
victim's possessions.

21:07.160 --> 21:08.760
So I thought I'd check it out.

21:08.800 --> 21:11.440
Turns out the bar was sold just under a year ago.

21:11.480 --> 21:14.080
-Colin Campbell.

21:14.120 --> 21:17.520
-They sure were.

21:17.560 --> 21:20.720
But the thing is, this place is

21:17.560 --> 21:20.720
virtually worthless.

21:20.760 --> 21:22.880
Turtles started breeding here a while back.

21:22.920 --> 21:26.400
The bar was closed down and a preservation order

21:22.920 --> 21:26.400
slapped on the whole beach.

21:26.440 --> 21:29.760
There's no building and no possibility of

21:26.440 --> 21:29.760
any redevelopment.

21:29.800 --> 21:32.080
So how come these plans exist?

21:32.120 --> 21:33.600
And why were they in our victim's room?

21:37.520 --> 21:41.160
There's no law against foreigners owning

21:37.520 --> 21:41.160
property on the island.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.280
Of course not. But the bar you bought

21:41.200 --> 21:43.280
is derelict.

21:46.320 --> 21:48.640
I buy the bar, that's my investment.

21:48.680 --> 21:51.960
But developing it is going to cost at least $60,000.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.440
-Friends.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.880
-Oh, Judith's already

21:54.480 --> 21:56.880
put some in.

21:56.920 --> 21:58.520
-40K.

21:58.560 --> 22:02.440
-Judith's already

21:58.560 --> 22:02.440
given you $40,000?

22:02.480 --> 22:05.240
-That's right. -But that's still not enough.

22:05.280 --> 22:07.200
Did you ever mention your plans to Dr Redding?

22:07.240 --> 22:09.560
-Of course. -How much money

22:07.240 --> 22:09.560
did you ask her for?

22:09.600 --> 22:11.080
I never asked Emma for a penny.

22:11.120 --> 22:13.680
Yet we found the plans for your bar in her room.

22:13.720 --> 22:15.520
Well, she took an interest, of course she did,

22:15.560 --> 22:17.240
but I didn't ask her to invest.

22:17.280 --> 22:19.760
You know there's a preservation

22:17.280 --> 22:19.760
order on that beach?

22:19.800 --> 22:21.960
You'll never be able to build on it.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.120
And yet you still took your friend's money?

22:24.160 --> 22:26.880
I intend to fight to get the order lifted.

22:26.920 --> 22:29.000
Let me make two predictions.

22:29.040 --> 22:31.760
One, I bet you never told Judith about the

22:29.040 --> 22:31.760
preservation order

22:31.800 --> 22:35.760
before you took her money. And two, the 40 grand

22:31.800 --> 22:35.760
she gave you is in an account

22:35.800 --> 22:38.720
-which you could clear out at any time.

22:38.760 --> 22:41.520
Did Dr Redding refuse to give you the rest

22:38.760 --> 22:41.520
of the money you needed?

22:41.560 --> 22:42.720
No.

22:44.120 --> 22:47.000
Look, you've got me all wrong.

22:47.040 --> 22:51.680
The reason I was so worried when Emma didn't show up

22:47.040 --> 22:51.680
for the party that night

22:51.720 --> 22:54.080
was that I was going to ask her to marry me.

22:54.920 --> 22:56.000
I loved her.

23:00.360 --> 23:04.920
So have Fidel get in touch with whoever's in charge

23:00.360 --> 23:04.920
of planning, at the town hall.

23:04.960 --> 23:07.720
See if Colin Campbell stood any chance of lifting

23:07.760 --> 23:10.080
that preservation order on the beach bar.

23:10.120 --> 23:14.280
Do you think he's a con man? That maybe Emma Redding

23:10.120 --> 23:14.280
discovered what he was up to?

23:14.320 --> 23:18.840
Oh, so he poisoned her before she could tell Judith that she

23:14.320 --> 23:18.840
stood to lose $40,000?

23:18.880 --> 23:21.480
Well, it's a possible who and why.

23:21.520 --> 23:23.320
But we can't prove anyone killed her

23:21.520 --> 23:23.320
if we can't establish

23:23.360 --> 23:25.080
how they got out that bloody room.

23:28.880 --> 23:33.320
You know, maybe we can finish a little early,

23:28.880 --> 23:33.320
if you want to get home?

23:33.360 --> 23:34.600
Hmm?

23:34.640 --> 23:36.520
Have a shower, get changed, before your date.

23:36.560 --> 23:38.000
Oh, it's hardly that, Camille.

23:38.040 --> 23:40.080
Your wife came a long way to see you.

23:40.960 --> 23:42.040
It must be important.

23:43.760 --> 23:48.440
Camille? The autopsy report.

23:43.760 --> 23:48.440
-Ah!

23:48.480 --> 23:51.840
The only food the pathologist found in the victim's stomach

23:48.480 --> 23:51.840
was the curry, rice and beans.

23:51.880 --> 23:54.520
Yes, her last meal, as we suspected.

23:54.560 --> 23:56.280
So have they identified the poison?

23:56.320 --> 23:58.800
Cause of death was a massive overdose

23:56.320 --> 23:58.800
of Propentin, the sleeping pills

23:58.840 --> 24:01.320
we found beside the body.

24:01.360 --> 24:05.160
All right, wasn't expecting that, but...

24:05.200 --> 24:06.920
Her killer must've got the sleeping pills,

24:06.960 --> 24:08.480
crushed them up and put them in the curry.

24:08.520 --> 24:10.800
Then he or she got into the room

24:10.840 --> 24:13.120
and staged the scene to look like suicide.

24:13.160 --> 24:17.160
Before getting through a door that was locked and bolted

24:13.160 --> 24:17.160
from the inside. How?

24:26.840 --> 24:29.080
-Okay.

24:29.120 --> 24:31.880
Could someone have given Emma the poison

24:29.120 --> 24:31.880
outside her room?

24:31.920 --> 24:36.040
-No, no way.

24:36.080 --> 24:39.280
She was already in her room when the food was delivered,

24:36.080 --> 24:39.280
on the video call to her son.

24:40.920 --> 24:44.960
The killer must've got the Propentin

24:40.920 --> 24:44.960
into the curry...

24:45.000 --> 24:47.360
-...somehow. -Then Sylvaine

24:45.000 --> 24:47.360
has to be our killer.

24:47.400 --> 24:49.920
-No! -Yes! She's the only person

24:47.400 --> 24:49.920
who went near the curry.

24:49.960 --> 24:51.280
I'm sorry, Camille, but I disagree.

24:51.320 --> 24:53.280
I don't think Sylvaine's the killer.

24:53.320 --> 24:56.160
Why would the manager of an old people's home want to

24:53.320 --> 24:56.160
kill one of her residents?

24:56.200 --> 24:58.800
Was there any indication Sylvaine and Emma

24:56.200 --> 24:58.800
didn't get on?

24:58.840 --> 25:00.680
Uh, were they ever seen arguing?

25:00.720 --> 25:03.080
Well, according to the residents, Emma and Sylvaine

25:00.720 --> 25:03.080
got on very well.

25:03.120 --> 25:04.240
Exactly, also...

25:09.840 --> 25:13.600
Why would she want to lose one of her

25:09.840 --> 25:13.600
paying customers, hmm?

25:13.640 --> 25:18.720
I don't think it's Sylvaine. Someone else got to

25:13.640 --> 25:18.720
that curry and doctored it.

25:19.640 --> 25:21.360
But how?

25:21.400 --> 25:25.720
I've got the victim's credit card statements through.

25:21.400 --> 25:25.720
Nothing unusual.

25:25.760 --> 25:29.240
She did go out to eat a lot, though. Five times

25:25.760 --> 25:29.240
in the past 10 days.

25:29.280 --> 25:31.400
I cross-checked the dates, but there's nothing

25:29.280 --> 25:31.400
in her diary.

25:31.440 --> 25:35.440
-All of them $100,

25:31.440 --> 25:35.440
all from the same restaurant.

25:35.480 --> 25:38.280
-Must be two people. -Okay, check it out.

25:38.320 --> 25:42.200
Well, um...  I don't think we can achieve

25:38.320 --> 25:42.200
much more today.

25:42.240 --> 25:45.000
Let's go over everything again tomorrow morning.

25:45.040 --> 25:47.720
Hopefully, we'll have the results back on the curry.

25:47.760 --> 25:50.920
-It's not like you to be the first to go, Chief.

25:52.960 --> 25:57.160
A date?

25:52.960 --> 25:57.160
No, no, um... I, uh...

25:57.200 --> 26:00.360
Well, I mean, I would stay if there was something

25:57.200 --> 26:00.360
to, uh, do.

26:00.400 --> 26:02.760
-I mean, there is no rush... -No, no, no, no. You go.

26:02.800 --> 26:04.000
We'll see you in the morning.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.560
Right.

26:05.600 --> 26:06.720
I'll...

26:08.320 --> 26:10.600
-Dwayne!

26:11.520 --> 26:12.560
What?

26:25.520 --> 26:28.080
Good evening. What can I get you?

26:28.120 --> 26:32.160
-Sorry, no. I have a Sauvignon

26:28.120 --> 26:32.160
blanc, it's quite dry.

26:32.200 --> 26:33.920
Right, that'll be lovely, thank you.

26:40.960 --> 26:43.600
-She only ordered a drink.

26:43.640 --> 26:48.800
Come on, <i> Maman!</i> You've been serving in bars for 30 years,

26:43.640 --> 26:48.800
that's more than enough time!

26:48.840 --> 26:52.560
-Actually, she was

26:48.840 --> 26:52.560
very sweet.

27:17.280 --> 27:20.080
Hi. -Hi.

27:20.120 --> 27:24.720
-No. I like what you've done

27:20.120 --> 27:24.720
with your hair.

27:24.760 --> 27:27.000
Oh, God! Does it look very stupid?

27:27.040 --> 27:29.600
No! I like it. It's very Humph.

27:29.640 --> 27:32.000
Humphrey, what can I get you?

27:32.040 --> 27:36.000
Oh, I would like, um, a beer, please,

27:32.040 --> 27:36.000
Catherine. Thank you.

27:42.080 --> 27:45.440
-I don't know what to say. -That's all right. Nor do I.

27:46.480 --> 27:49.240
Hey! What's happened to his hair?

27:53.560 --> 27:56.120
-Hey! -There is one thing

27:53.560 --> 27:56.120
I've been meaning to tell you.

27:56.160 --> 27:58.560
You know those car alarms you can hear

27:56.160 --> 27:58.560
when it's stopped raining?

27:58.600 --> 28:01.480
-They're not car alarms, turns out they're these...

27:58.600 --> 28:01.480
-BOTH: Amazing frogs.

28:01.520 --> 28:03.800
-I know. -Of course you do.

28:06.160 --> 28:08.240
-Thank you. -You're very welcome.

28:17.280 --> 28:20.640
Why aren't we married any more?

28:20.680 --> 28:23.040
I still don't really know what happened.

28:20.680 --> 28:23.040
I mean, I got your message

28:23.080 --> 28:24.560
and I've listened to it over and over.

28:24.600 --> 28:26.800
The thing is, it doesn't really

28:24.600 --> 28:26.800
tell me anything.

28:26.840 --> 28:28.880
Except of course, that you didn't love me

28:26.840 --> 28:28.880
any more, which is...

28:28.920 --> 28:31.640
...fair enough. It's just...

28:34.280 --> 28:36.080
-No.

28:37.680 --> 28:38.800
Right. Good.

28:40.240 --> 28:42.000
I just got a bit lost, Humph.

28:43.360 --> 28:45.880
Like I didn't know who I was any more.

28:45.920 --> 28:48.280
Like I was drowning in this never-ending whirlpool

28:48.320 --> 28:52.560
of niceness and understanding and routine.

28:52.600 --> 28:55.400
Days and conversations just merging

28:52.600 --> 28:55.400
into one another

28:55.440 --> 28:57.320
until I couldn't tell them apart any more.

28:57.360 --> 29:02.280
Everything was just a blob. Just a soggy, fat, huge,

28:57.360 --> 29:02.280
predictable blob.

29:03.520 --> 29:05.560
-Sorry. -You don't need

29:03.520 --> 29:05.560
to apologise.

29:05.600 --> 29:10.640
This wasn't about you, Humph, this was me.

29:05.600 --> 29:10.640
It was all me.

29:10.680 --> 29:13.880
I thought I wanted something different.

29:10.680 --> 29:13.880
Something...

29:14.760 --> 29:16.200
New and exciting.

29:18.280 --> 29:22.120
You think I'd get it, wouldn't you?

29:18.280 --> 29:22.120
Being a botanist, I mean?

29:22.160 --> 29:24.240
Well, the grass isn't always greener.

29:27.680 --> 29:29.280
I miss how smart you are.

29:37.680 --> 29:40.200
I'm starting to realise that letting you go

29:42.320 --> 29:45.160
may well qualify as the biggest mistake

29:42.320 --> 29:45.160
I've ever made.

29:48.920 --> 29:50.120
Humph, I just need...

29:55.080 --> 29:56.160
Humph.

30:01.360 --> 30:02.520
Uh-oh.

30:21.800 --> 30:25.080
-Ah!

30:25.120 --> 30:27.720
Just gathering my thoughts for the day ahead. Mmm.

30:33.040 --> 30:35.360
I'm sorry, Camille, if I've been

30:33.040 --> 30:35.360
a little bit, uh...

30:36.440 --> 30:38.560
Preoccupied since Sally arrived.

30:38.600 --> 30:40.120
-It's very unprofessional of me.

30:38.600 --> 30:40.120
-No, it isn't.

30:40.160 --> 30:42.040
No, no, it is. A lady lost her life.

30:42.080 --> 30:45.640
We're duty-bound to put everything else aside

30:45.680 --> 30:48.360
-until we find the person responsible.

30:45.680 --> 30:48.360
-Mmm-hmm.

30:50.840 --> 30:53.840
Last night?

30:53.880 --> 30:56.000
Yes, well, we went to your mother's bar.

30:53.880 --> 30:56.000
I thought we would see you.

30:56.040 --> 30:59.840
Oh, no, I was, um... I was busy. So?

31:01.760 --> 31:04.000
Camille, would you mind very much

31:01.760 --> 31:04.000
if I didn't talk about it?

31:04.960 --> 31:06.040
Not just yet.

31:07.440 --> 31:08.600
-Of course. -Thank you.

31:16.320 --> 31:20.280
So, we have the toxicology report back first thing.

31:20.320 --> 31:21.480
Mmm

31:21.520 --> 31:23.960
The lab tested the curry from Emma's room

31:24.000 --> 31:27.960
and they found no trace of Propentin in it.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.840
-But all she ate that night was that curry.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.840
-Mmm-hmm.

31:30.880 --> 31:33.040
She overdosed on Propentin. It had to be hidden

31:30.880 --> 31:33.040
in the curry!

31:33.080 --> 31:36.280
The lab says not. It really was just

31:33.080 --> 31:36.280
a plate of curry.

31:36.320 --> 31:39.040
Then how did the killer get her to overdose?

31:36.320 --> 31:39.040
How was she killed?

31:40.400 --> 31:43.080
Why does nothing about this case

31:40.400 --> 31:43.080
make any sense?

31:43.120 --> 31:45.200
Now, a woman makes sure her will is in order.

31:45.240 --> 31:47.960
We then later find her alone, dead from

31:45.240 --> 31:47.960
a sleeping pill overdose,

31:48.000 --> 31:50.040
the empty packet of pills beside her,

31:50.080 --> 31:52.520
no traces of drugs found in the food

31:50.080 --> 31:52.520
she ate before she died,

31:52.560 --> 31:54.640
and the door is locked and bolted from the inside.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.160
What if it's suicide after all?

31:57.080 --> 31:58.200
I don't believe it.

31:59.040 --> 32:00.120
Neither do I.

32:04.440 --> 32:05.960
Sally wants to give it another go.

32:07.320 --> 32:09.720
-Oh. -Said she'd made

32:07.320 --> 32:09.720
a terrible mistake.

32:11.360 --> 32:13.200
Okay...

32:13.240 --> 32:15.760
-I don't know.

32:16.320 --> 32:19.520
Yeah. Of course.

32:19.560 --> 32:23.520
She called me this morning and asked me to meet her

32:19.560 --> 32:23.520
for dinner tonight.

32:23.560 --> 32:25.840
That's good, isn't it?

32:25.880 --> 32:28.200
-I think she'll want an answer.

32:28.240 --> 32:30.560
-Depends on how you feel.

32:34.560 --> 32:37.040
Maybe I should just concentrate

32:34.560 --> 32:37.040
on the job in hand.

32:39.080 --> 32:42.680
Put everything else out of my mind and concentrate on

32:39.080 --> 32:42.680
who killed Sally Redding.

32:43.440 --> 32:44.920
Emma! Emma Redding!

32:54.840 --> 32:56.760
I went to that restaurant last night.

32:54.840 --> 32:56.760
You know, the one where Emma had been using

32:56.800 --> 32:58.720
her credit card?

32:58.760 --> 33:03.000
I got them to match their CCTV with the dates and times

32:58.760 --> 33:03.000
of the transactions.

33:03.040 --> 33:07.080
-She was there with

33:03.040 --> 33:07.080
the same person every time.

33:07.120 --> 33:09.880
Right, well, Colin Campbell, I presume,

33:07.120 --> 33:09.880
seeing as he's her boyfriend.

33:10.400 --> 33:11.440
It wasn't Colin.

33:13.200 --> 33:15.200
Turns out her dining companion was...

33:16.480 --> 33:17.720
Jim Chandler.

33:19.600 --> 33:22.360
HUMPHREY: Hmm. I wonder if Mrs Chandler

33:19.600 --> 33:22.360
knew about this.

33:37.760 --> 33:40.280
You've gotta come out here.

33:37.760 --> 33:40.280
You'd love it!

33:42.280 --> 33:44.160
-Bye! -WOMAN: <i> Oh, bye, Pam!</i>

33:44.200 --> 33:46.080
-Oh. -Good afternoon.

33:46.120 --> 33:50.320
Oh! It's a friend of mine, stuck in southeast London.

33:50.360 --> 33:52.840
Can you imagine? When she could be

33:50.360 --> 33:52.840
out here!

33:52.880 --> 33:53.960
Is your husband here?

33:54.000 --> 33:55.360
JIM: Can I help you?

33:55.400 --> 33:59.840
Yes, uh, we'd just like a quick word.

33:59.880 --> 34:04.800
Yeah, okay, um, maybe we'd be best down at the dining area.

33:59.880 --> 34:04.800
It's quieter there.

34:04.840 --> 34:06.960
-Yes, of course. -PAM: Nonsense!

34:07.000 --> 34:09.840
Anything you have to say, you can say in front of me.

34:10.960 --> 34:12.080
Can't you?

34:13.640 --> 34:15.200
-Yes, of course. -Well, then...

34:17.320 --> 34:19.160
How can I help?

34:19.200 --> 34:21.680
Well, we're, uh, trying to establish

34:19.200 --> 34:21.680
the exact nature

34:21.720 --> 34:23.560
of your relationship with Emma Redding.

34:23.600 --> 34:26.360
We know you've been having private meals

34:23.600 --> 34:26.360
with her in town,

34:26.400 --> 34:28.640
on at least six different occasions.

34:28.680 --> 34:30.840
HUMPHREY: Yes, you've known each other for years.

34:30.880 --> 34:32.000
Indeed, it was you who suggested

34:32.040 --> 34:33.840
she come out to the island,

34:33.880 --> 34:37.120
so I must ask again, what was the nature of

34:33.880 --> 34:37.120
your relationship with Emma?

34:38.840 --> 34:40.600
Jim?

34:40.640 --> 34:42.360
You think we were having an affair?

34:44.560 --> 34:45.600
Well, were you?

34:51.400 --> 34:55.200
Eight years ago, I had cancer, of the colon.

34:56.760 --> 35:00.200
We spotted it early, had a bit of surgery

35:00.240 --> 35:01.440
and we cut the tumour out.

35:02.960 --> 35:04.560
That's why Pam and I came out here.

35:04.600 --> 35:07.760
We decided life was for the living.

35:09.720 --> 35:12.280
I still go for regular checkups, of course I do,

35:13.240 --> 35:14.480
and the last one...

35:16.160 --> 35:17.600
My blood count was high.

35:20.600 --> 35:21.640
What?

35:22.640 --> 35:24.440
They wanted me to go in for more tests,

35:25.720 --> 35:28.200
and I found myself asking Emma's advice,

35:28.240 --> 35:30.560
just as an old friend and a doctor.

35:30.600 --> 35:32.040
And she said she'd go with me.

35:37.960 --> 35:39.160
The bastard's back.

35:43.600 --> 35:45.280
Why didn't you tell me?

35:45.320 --> 35:46.720
I didn't want to burden you.

35:47.520 --> 35:49.480
Not again.

35:49.520 --> 35:51.520
That's why I told Emma it had to be a secret.

35:54.480 --> 35:58.240
But I thought... -I know. I'm sorry.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.880
The restaurant we went to was right next to the hospital.

36:03.920 --> 36:05.600
Most of the time, I was begging Emma

36:05.640 --> 36:07.160
to look after my Pammy for me.

36:16.200 --> 36:18.520
JIM: It's all right. It's all right.

36:22.960 --> 36:26.320
Camille, get in touch with Jim Chandler's doctor,

36:22.960 --> 36:26.320
confirm his story, would you?

36:26.360 --> 36:27.560
Yes.

36:29.280 --> 36:30.920
I've just spoken to a friend of mine

36:29.280 --> 36:30.920
at the Planning Department,

36:30.960 --> 36:33.640
and it turns out that the beach where

36:30.960 --> 36:33.640
Colin bought his bar

36:33.680 --> 36:36.800
was only ever suspected of being a turtle nesting site.

36:36.840 --> 36:38.480
If he challenged the preservation order,

36:38.520 --> 36:40.440
there's every chance he'd get it overturned.

36:40.480 --> 36:44.280
And worse than that, if he's a con man,

36:40.480 --> 36:44.280
he's a very bad one.

36:44.320 --> 36:49.040
I spoke to his bank. He opened a joint account

36:44.320 --> 36:49.040
with Judith Musgrove.

36:49.080 --> 36:52.920
There's $40,000 in it. But no one's

36:49.080 --> 36:52.920
ever touched a cent.

36:56.160 --> 36:58.000
So...

36:58.040 --> 37:00.560
Colin's not a con man, and Jim wasn't

36:58.040 --> 37:00.560
having an affair.

37:00.600 --> 37:04.680
Who killed Dr Emma Redding

37:04.720 --> 37:06.320
-FIDEL: Thank you very much.

37:08.320 --> 37:10.480
-Sir, I might have found another suspect.

37:10.520 --> 37:13.640
Okay, so I've been looking into David Witton, right?

37:10.520 --> 37:13.640
And here's the thing.

37:15.440 --> 37:17.760
That's right. Because she went into

37:15.440 --> 37:17.760
hospital 10 years ago.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.920
It was routine surgery to have gallstones removed,

37:19.960 --> 37:22.560
but the operation went wrong. She died in

37:19.960 --> 37:22.560
the operating theatre.

37:22.600 --> 37:24.680
And guess who the surgeon was

37:22.600 --> 37:24.680
who operated on her?

37:25.480 --> 37:26.560
Emma Redding.

37:37.560 --> 37:38.840
You know, don't you?

37:38.880 --> 37:40.480
What are you doing here, Mr Witton?

37:41.760 --> 37:45.240
-No.

37:45.280 --> 37:47.360
DAVID: Your life changes when you become a parent.

37:48.640 --> 37:50.400
It's like there was a before,

37:50.440 --> 37:54.440
but now you know your child's the reason you're alive.

37:54.480 --> 37:56.320
Why you're on the planet.

37:56.360 --> 37:58.240
Dr Emma Redding was your daughter's surgeon.

37:58.280 --> 37:59.840
Joanna. Her name was Joanna.

38:01.480 --> 38:02.720
Her mother and me,

38:02.760 --> 38:04.880
our marriage didn't survive. How could it?

38:06.160 --> 38:08.840
I convinced myself that I had to find out

38:08.880 --> 38:12.840
who had done this, the surgeon who killed Joanna.

38:12.880 --> 38:14.000
So you came to Saint Marie?

38:15.760 --> 38:17.200
You make it sound so simple.

38:19.360 --> 38:21.400
<i>When I knew</i> <i>she was out here...</i>

38:21.440 --> 38:24.040
-Yay! <i>-...I only ever wanted</i>

38:21.440 --> 38:24.040
<i>to see her, to talk to her,</i>

38:24.080 --> 38:27.120
<i>find out what kind</i> <i>of person she was.</i>

38:27.160 --> 38:30.120
See if she was haunted by the girl who died

38:30.160 --> 38:31.560
on her operating table.

38:33.440 --> 38:34.800
But when it came down to it,

38:35.880 --> 38:37.640
I didn't even have the courage

38:37.680 --> 38:38.880
to tell her who I was.

38:43.920 --> 38:46.560
You know, I didn't know true loneliness

38:46.600 --> 38:48.520
until I came to a retirement home.

38:50.080 --> 38:51.400
I mean, look at them.

38:57.600 --> 38:58.720
Everyone's got someone.

39:04.560 --> 39:07.240
You probably think I killed her, don't you?

39:07.280 --> 39:10.680
-There were times

39:07.280 --> 39:10.680
when I could've done.

39:10.720 --> 39:12.040
Maybe even would have done.

39:13.200 --> 39:14.320
But no.

39:15.280 --> 39:16.480
I didn't.

39:30.160 --> 39:34.400
You were right, Fidel, David Witton only came here

39:30.160 --> 39:34.400
because of Emma Redding.

39:34.440 --> 39:36.800
Oh, so what do you think

39:36.840 --> 39:39.640
-Well, he's certainly got a motive.

39:39.680 --> 39:43.520
I don't know, he seemed genuine.

39:39.680 --> 39:43.520
I don't think he's our killer.

39:43.560 --> 39:45.400
Yeah, well, this case is weird anyway.

39:45.440 --> 39:47.480
If the killer can get out through

39:45.440 --> 39:47.480
a locked and bolted door,

39:47.520 --> 39:49.240
there's no point in catching them.

39:49.280 --> 39:50.720
How are we going to keep them locked up?

39:50.760 --> 39:53.560
-You know something, he's got a point.

39:50.760 --> 39:53.560
Yes.

39:53.600 --> 39:56.280
Well, I'll see you both in the morning.

39:59.640 --> 40:01.920
Ah! He has a date.

40:01.960 --> 40:03.760
-Yeah.

40:03.800 --> 40:05.240
-You're kidding me! -Mmm-mmm.

40:18.440 --> 40:19.840
-Hi! -Hi.

40:20.680 --> 40:22.680
-No.

40:24.840 --> 40:27.840
Try it, you'll love it. It's like the whole of the

40:24.840 --> 40:27.840
Caribbean but in a glass.

40:30.760 --> 40:32.400
Oh!

40:32.440 --> 40:34.360
Yeah.

40:34.400 --> 40:37.560
Well, it's basically neat rum. That's why it's so Caribbean.

40:37.600 --> 40:39.360
Yeah. Give me a gin and slim any time!

40:42.520 --> 40:44.880
-Not really.

40:44.920 --> 40:48.240
-No, I've got this case

40:44.920 --> 40:48.240
that's driving me a bit mad.

40:48.280 --> 40:49.920
-You see, there's this woman...

40:49.960 --> 40:54.240
Could I possibly swap this for a gin

40:49.960 --> 40:54.240
and slimline tonic?

40:54.280 --> 40:55.800
-Of course. -Thank you.

40:57.880 --> 40:59.200
Have you thought about what I said?

41:00.320 --> 41:01.560
I've thought of little else.

41:02.120 --> 41:03.560
-Well...

41:04.120 --> 41:05.560
DWAYNE: Chief!

41:05.600 --> 41:08.720
Ah! Dwayne, Fidel. Hello.

41:08.760 --> 41:12.120
Uh... Sally, this is Dwayne, Fidel,

41:08.760 --> 41:12.120
we work together.

41:12.160 --> 41:13.760
-Very nice to meet you. -You too.

41:13.800 --> 41:16.160
-Mrs Goodman, welcome to Saint Marie.

41:13.800 --> 41:16.160
-Thank you.

41:16.200 --> 41:19.920
Fidel!

41:16.200 --> 41:19.920
-Sir.

41:19.960 --> 41:21.480
-Bye. -BOTH: Bye.

41:23.640 --> 41:26.440
-SALLY: Oh, they seem nice. -Yes, they are.

41:26.480 --> 41:28.680
What are you doing?

41:26.480 --> 41:28.680
-Having a beer.

41:28.720 --> 41:31.400
No, no, no, no. You promised me

41:28.720 --> 41:31.400
you wouldn't come in here!

41:31.440 --> 41:34.000
-He promised. I didn't commit.

41:31.440 --> 41:34.000
-He made me. You see, this is exactly why

41:34.040 --> 41:36.600
I didn't want to tell you.

41:38.440 --> 41:40.240
-For you. -...and fell out the window.

41:45.440 --> 41:48.560
I have missed you, you know.

41:48.600 --> 41:51.720
Yeah, see, this is the bit where you say that you've

41:48.600 --> 41:51.720
missed me too, and then...

41:51.760 --> 41:54.000
Of course I miss you.

41:56.440 --> 41:57.560
So?

41:58.760 --> 42:00.320
There's something you said yesterday.

42:02.160 --> 42:05.560
I wrote it down. Sorry, uh...

42:05.600 --> 42:09.360
I thought it was important to remember

42:05.600 --> 42:09.360
the words you said.

42:13.000 --> 42:15.840
You said you were drowning

42:15.880 --> 42:21.560
in a never-ending whirlpool of niceness,

42:15.880 --> 42:21.560
understanding and routine.

42:21.600 --> 42:25.040
-God, that's sounds awful. -Everything was a soggy,

42:25.080 --> 42:29.360
fat, huge, predictable blob.

42:29.400 --> 42:31.480
-Humph, look... -Just let me finish.

42:32.560 --> 42:35.160
Okay? See, you're right.

42:36.160 --> 42:38.600
You were right, I mean.

42:38.640 --> 42:39.760
To feel that way.

42:40.680 --> 42:42.040
It's exactly how it was.

42:42.760 --> 42:43.840
For me too.

42:45.640 --> 42:48.520
-I thought if we

42:45.640 --> 42:48.520
could get away,

42:48.560 --> 42:55.480
start anew, find something different together,

42:48.560 --> 42:55.480
find something exciting,

42:55.520 --> 43:00.200
get out of our soggy blob, we could be like

42:55.520 --> 43:00.200
we used to be.

43:00.240 --> 43:02.320
That's what I wanted too.

43:02.360 --> 43:03.720
Only you didn't, did you, Sal?

43:06.920 --> 43:09.080
You didn't come with me.

43:09.120 --> 43:13.800
I was here waiting for our fresh start,

43:13.840 --> 43:15.680
and you left me a message on an answer-phone.

43:17.280 --> 43:18.520
I was trying to save us,

43:18.560 --> 43:20.280
and you were trying to save yourself.

43:29.320 --> 43:31.480
So...

43:33.880 --> 43:35.840
I found different,

43:37.880 --> 43:40.760
and I found new, and I found exciting

43:41.840 --> 43:44.120
and I did all that without you.

43:45.480 --> 43:49.080
-I'm someone else now, Sal. -Don't be ridiculous.

43:49.120 --> 43:53.160
It's true, Sally. I'm rum punch

43:49.120 --> 43:53.160
and you're still gin and slim.

43:54.320 --> 43:55.400
God...

43:57.160 --> 43:58.400
You're dumping me?

43:58.440 --> 44:00.840
Sorry, Sal, it's not what I wanted.

44:01.960 --> 44:03.160
It's just what happened.

44:05.040 --> 44:06.120
What you made happen.

44:16.400 --> 44:19.200
Not me, sir.

44:20.880 --> 44:22.000
I'll go.

44:31.400 --> 44:34.400
The first time, you walked out,

44:31.400 --> 44:34.400
and now her?

44:34.440 --> 44:37.720
-You weren't here the first time.

44:34.440 --> 44:37.720
-I was hiding.

44:38.600 --> 44:39.760
Oh.

44:45.960 --> 44:47.240
So, can I ask what happened?

44:48.280 --> 44:50.200
It's finished.

44:50.240 --> 44:52.680
-I thought she said she'd made a mistake.

44:50.240 --> 44:52.680
-Yes, she did.

44:53.600 --> 44:54.720
She was wrong.

44:55.720 --> 44:57.960
-I'm sorry. -Don't be.

45:00.160 --> 45:03.040
-Yes, yes, there is, actually.

45:03.520 --> 45:05.160
Okay...

45:05.200 --> 45:07.520
What any self-respecting colleague

45:05.200 --> 45:07.520
would do in the circumstances.

45:08.760 --> 45:09.960
Get me extremely drunk

45:10.000 --> 45:11.960
and then pour me into a cab.

45:12.000 --> 45:16.160
It's a deal. <i> Maman!</i> Two rum punches, please.

45:18.200 --> 45:20.320
Oh, wow. And keep them coming!

45:21.400 --> 45:22.640
Okay.

45:46.720 --> 45:48.200
-Morning! -Morning, sir!

45:48.240 --> 45:49.560
-Chief. -Ah, Camille!

45:51.920 --> 45:54.840
I'm not sure how I got into the cab

45:51.920 --> 45:54.840
last night,

45:54.880 --> 45:57.880
-assume it was you, so thank you.

45:57.920 --> 46:00.640
Bacon, egg, sausage, baked beans,

45:57.920 --> 46:00.640
two slices of fried bread.

46:00.680 --> 46:03.160
You should try it. Right. I've been thinking,

46:03.200 --> 46:05.360
-the crow and the pitcher.

46:05.400 --> 46:07.000
You know, the old fable.

46:07.040 --> 46:09.640
A crow finds a pitcher of water one day

46:07.040 --> 46:09.640
and wants a drink,

46:09.680 --> 46:14.080
but the thing is, the neck of the jug is too long for him

46:09.680 --> 46:14.080
to reach down to the water.

46:14.120 --> 46:18.320
So he tries and he tries and he tries until he realises

46:14.120 --> 46:18.320
he needs a new approach.

46:18.360 --> 46:20.640
Rather than trying to reach down,

46:20.680 --> 46:23.960
he gets pebbles and drops them in to the pitcher and brings

46:20.680 --> 46:23.960
the water up to him.

46:25.760 --> 46:28.800
-I'm not with you, sir, sorry. -A fresh approach.

46:28.840 --> 46:30.640
Your point being?

46:30.680 --> 46:33.760
We've spent our whole time trying to reach down

46:30.680 --> 46:33.760
to the water,

46:33.800 --> 46:37.200
so why not make the water reach up to us?

46:41.160 --> 46:42.360
One minute.

46:49.800 --> 46:52.480
-Let me open the door for you! -Step away

46:49.800 --> 46:52.480
from the door!

46:55.640 --> 46:57.400
Oh!

47:00.680 --> 47:01.840
Are you okay, sir?

47:03.720 --> 47:08.320
So, two men break down a door,

47:03.720 --> 47:08.320
that requires a lot of force.

47:08.360 --> 47:11.680
-I don't understand. -Don't worry, Camille,

47:08.360 --> 47:11.680
neither do I,

47:11.720 --> 47:14.960
but we've hit a brick wall and I'm just trying to come

47:11.720 --> 47:14.960
at it from a different angle.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.920
Boy, it's lucky the door was only bolted, Chief,

47:15.000 --> 47:17.920
and not locked as well,

47:17.960 --> 47:20.320
or I reckon it would definitely have felt

47:17.960 --> 47:20.320
like a brick wall.

47:21.640 --> 47:25.040
-No. Wait! Maybe you're right!

47:25.840 --> 47:28.000
But what does that mean?

47:28.040 --> 47:30.120
If the door was bolted first... Yes, of course!

47:30.160 --> 47:34.240
But the curry... How can you kill someone by putting

47:30.160 --> 47:34.240
sleeping pills in a curry

47:34.280 --> 47:35.360
without putting sleeping pills in the curry?

47:35.400 --> 47:36.480
ALL: You can't.

47:36.520 --> 47:37.800
How can you take any trace of the pills

47:37.840 --> 47:39.680
out from the curry after it's been eaten?

47:39.720 --> 47:40.960
ALL: You can't do that either.

47:41.000 --> 47:42.960
Yet if the only explanation is that someone did,

47:43.000 --> 47:44.440
then that's what must have happened.

47:44.480 --> 47:46.640
-He must be still drunk. -I heard that, Dwayne.

47:46.680 --> 47:48.280
Unless it's different. What if it's different?

47:48.320 --> 47:49.680
What if the door isn't the door,

47:49.720 --> 47:51.360
or at least not the door that we thought the door was?

47:51.400 --> 47:52.640
What if the curry wasn't the curry?

48:07.200 --> 48:09.240
CAMILLE: <i>Sylvaine doesn't think</i>

48:07.200 --> 48:09.240
<i>anyone could have tampered</i>

48:09.280 --> 48:10.760
<i>with her food while</i> <i>she was delivering it.</i>

48:18.040 --> 48:19.480
That's why it didn't make sense!

48:19.520 --> 48:21.000
You know who the killer is?

48:21.040 --> 48:22.360
And how they got out of the locked room?

48:22.400 --> 48:24.800
You know what? I think I do.

48:24.840 --> 48:26.880
I just need to make a phone call first.

48:53.600 --> 48:54.680
HUMPHREY: Good afternoon.

48:56.040 --> 48:57.880
As each one of you has at one time

48:57.920 --> 48:59.360
or another fallen under

48:59.400 --> 49:02.160
the spotlight of our suspicion,

49:02.200 --> 49:04.840
I felt that you were all owed an explanation...

49:08.040 --> 49:11.160
Sorry! Something wrong with that step.

49:11.200 --> 49:14.720
I felt you were all owed

49:11.200 --> 49:14.720
an explanation

49:14.760 --> 49:16.760
of how Emma Redding was killed.

49:16.800 --> 49:19.480
-Yes, she was.

49:20.680 --> 49:22.640
And what's more, her killer is in this room.

49:31.560 --> 49:33.640
Why are you looking at me?

49:33.680 --> 49:36.720
Because Emma Redding was killed by the curry

49:33.680 --> 49:36.720
you took to her room.

49:36.760 --> 49:41.000
-I didn't do anything! -Don't worry, I know

49:36.760 --> 49:41.000
you didn't kill anyone.

49:42.200 --> 49:43.800
Because after you put the tray down

49:43.840 --> 49:45.960
was when the real killer entered the room.

49:47.960 --> 49:49.240
And that was you...

49:50.520 --> 49:51.760
Me? No! ...wasn't it...

49:57.680 --> 49:58.840
Judith?

49:59.920 --> 50:02.440
What are you talking about?

50:02.480 --> 50:05.760
Tell me, when did you get hold of

50:02.480 --> 50:05.760
Emma's sleeping pills?

50:07.160 --> 50:10.160
<i>It wouldn't have been hard.</i> <i>Not for a good friend.</i>

50:13.120 --> 50:14.920
But as for the trick of how you got into

50:14.960 --> 50:17.520
and out of a locked room, that was harder

50:14.960 --> 50:17.520
to work out.

50:17.560 --> 50:22.680
But then I realised, that's why Emma looked

50:17.560 --> 50:22.680
at her will that afternoon.

50:22.720 --> 50:26.000
-It was at your suggestion. -And it was very clever.

50:26.040 --> 50:30.960
Because not only did it allow you to tell us that Emma was

50:26.040 --> 50:30.960
not her usual, upbeat self...

50:31.000 --> 50:34.480
Thought she was pre-occupied. Worried, even.

50:34.520 --> 50:37.200
Then suggested she was maybe getting

50:34.520 --> 50:37.200
her affairs in order...

50:37.240 --> 50:39.360
It also gave you access to Emma's room,

50:39.400 --> 50:41.240
where, of course, she kept a chalet key.

50:51.160 --> 50:52.520
And when you had that,

50:52.560 --> 50:55.880
you were ready to commit murder,

50:52.560 --> 50:55.880
weren't you?

50:55.920 --> 50:59.640
<i>You ordered chicken curry</i> <i>that night, which you then</i>

50:55.920 --> 50:59.640
<i>poisoned with sleeping pills.</i>

51:04.040 --> 51:07.560
<i>You then went to</i> <i>Emma's room and pretended</i>

51:04.040 --> 51:07.560
<i>there'd been a mix up.</i>

51:07.600 --> 51:09.680
You'd ordered fish, the other curry that night,

51:09.720 --> 51:11.360
but you'd got her chicken.

51:11.400 --> 51:14.040
Which was the one risk you took.

51:14.080 --> 51:17.080
Because there was a witness to the switchover,

51:14.080 --> 51:17.080
wasn't there?

51:17.120 --> 51:18.840
Even though the witness was thousands of miles

51:18.880 --> 51:20.720
away at the time.

51:20.760 --> 51:23.800
HUMPHREY: Emma was on a video call to her son

51:20.760 --> 51:23.800
when you went into the room.

51:23.840 --> 51:26.800
In fact, you were relying on that

51:23.840 --> 51:26.800
fact, she was distracted.

51:26.840 --> 51:30.560
You just had to hope that we wouldn't ask him if anyone

51:26.840 --> 51:30.560
else came into the room.

51:30.600 --> 51:33.880
And why would we? Her death was

51:30.600 --> 51:33.880
so obviously a suicide.

51:33.920 --> 51:35.800
FIDEL: We rang Emma's son.

51:35.840 --> 51:38.160
He heard you come in whilst he was still talking to Emma.

51:38.200 --> 51:40.360
I think they've got our dinners mixed up.

51:40.400 --> 51:44.400
I've got your chicken curry and you'll have my fish.

51:44.440 --> 51:45.560
Thanks, Judith.

51:49.120 --> 51:50.600
So, love...

51:50.640 --> 51:52.200
Once Emma had finished speaking to her son,

51:52.880 --> 51:54.000
she ate her dinner.

51:55.960 --> 51:57.680
<i>And, as we'd</i> <i>already suspected,</i>

51:57.720 --> 51:59.400
<i>the flavours of the curry</i>

51:59.440 --> 52:01.560
<i>hid the taste</i> <i>of the overdose that</i>

51:59.440 --> 52:01.560
<i>was about to kill her.</i>

52:01.600 --> 52:05.160
<i>By the time she realised</i> <i>what was happening,</i>

52:01.600 --> 52:05.160
<i>it was just too late.</i>

52:12.480 --> 52:15.640
At which point, it was now time to make it look

52:12.480 --> 52:15.640
like a suicide.

52:15.680 --> 52:19.280
Hmm. First you needed some leftovers that had no trace

52:15.680 --> 52:19.280
of sleeping pills in.

52:19.320 --> 52:22.040
Well, that was easy. You already had

52:19.320 --> 52:22.040
Emma's curry.

52:22.080 --> 52:24.480
<i>And you already had her key,</i> <i>so you could let yourself in.</i>

52:32.440 --> 52:35.760
<i>You then made sure</i> <i>you left Emma's</i>

52:32.440 --> 52:35.760
<i>empty packet</i>

52:35.800 --> 52:38.400
<i>of sleeping pills at her side,</i> <i>and a glass of water.</i>

52:40.160 --> 52:42.480
<i>It was then the work</i> <i>of a moment to replace</i>

52:40.160 --> 52:42.480
<i>the incriminating curry</i>

52:42.520 --> 52:44.320
<i>with the plate you brought.</i>

52:44.360 --> 52:48.240
And now the scene was set for the final

52:44.360 --> 52:48.240
part of the illusion.

52:48.280 --> 52:51.280
You were going to get out

52:48.280 --> 52:51.280
of a locked room.

52:51.320 --> 52:55.240
All it took was a little re-enactment to realise

52:51.320 --> 52:55.240
how you did it.

52:55.280 --> 52:57.400
See, first you opened the latch lock,

52:57.440 --> 52:59.440
but made sure the steel bolt was closed.

53:01.360 --> 53:03.840
<i>The door frame was old.</i> <i>It wouldn't have been too hard</i>

53:01.360 --> 53:03.840
<i>to break the bolt</i>

53:03.880 --> 53:06.560
<i>not for someone who was</i> <i>already prepared</i>

53:03.880 --> 53:06.560
<i>to commit murder.</i>

53:09.760 --> 53:12.920
<i>But then, having smashed only</i> <i>one of the locks, you left,</i>

53:12.960 --> 53:16.280
<i>using the other lock</i> <i>to secure the door.</i>

53:16.320 --> 53:20.760
<i>You then placed the plate</i> <i>of poisoned curry on a tray</i>

53:16.320 --> 53:20.760
<i>outside your own room,</i>

53:20.800 --> 53:23.280
<i>knowing that</i> <i>Sylvaine would</i>

53:20.800 --> 53:23.280
<i>carry it away later.</i>

53:24.480 --> 53:28.000
An almost perfect murder.

53:28.040 --> 53:29.800
<i>Because when the door</i> <i>was finally smashed in,</i>

53:29.840 --> 53:32.360
<i>you knew that we'd find</i> <i>the remnants of two bust locks</i>

53:32.400 --> 53:34.760
<i>and presume</i> <i>that they were both</i>

53:32.400 --> 53:34.760
<i>broken at the same time.</i>

53:38.520 --> 53:41.280
The suicide wasn't a suicide,

53:41.320 --> 53:44.960
the curry wasn't the curry, and the locked

53:41.320 --> 53:44.960
and bolted door

53:45.000 --> 53:46.880
wasn't locked and bolted, it was just locked.

53:50.720 --> 53:53.600
You know, I should've realised

53:53.640 --> 53:56.200
when David here said that he didn't know

53:56.240 --> 53:59.440
true loneliness until he came here.

53:59.480 --> 54:03.200
Because he's right. Everyone here

53:59.480 --> 54:03.200
has someone else.

54:04.480 --> 54:06.920
<i>And you had Colin,</i> <i>didn't you?</i>

54:06.960 --> 54:08.560
<i>Always doing</i> <i>the crossword together.</i>

54:08.600 --> 54:10.080
<i>Always there</i> <i>for one another.</i>

54:10.120 --> 54:11.640
<i>In fact, you waited on him</i> <i>hand and foot,</i>

54:11.680 --> 54:13.800
<i>like an old married couple,</i> <i>if you didn't know any better.</i>

54:13.840 --> 54:18.000
You even put $40,000 of your own money

54:13.840 --> 54:18.000
into Colin's bar,

54:18.040 --> 54:21.360
never even checking for a moment whether it was

54:18.040 --> 54:21.360
a non-starter or not.

54:21.400 --> 54:22.960
Proving that love really is blind.

54:23.000 --> 54:26.240
It must have been wonderful to finally

54:23.000 --> 54:26.240
find a companion.

54:27.400 --> 54:29.680
And then Emma came along.

54:29.720 --> 54:32.240
COLIN: <i> The reason</i> <i>I was so worried that</i>

54:29.720 --> 54:32.240
<i>Emma hadn't shown up</i>

54:32.280 --> 54:35.280
<i>for the dance that night</i> <i>was that I was going</i>

54:32.280 --> 54:35.280
<i>to ask her to marry me.</i>

54:36.480 --> 54:38.520
I loved her.

54:38.560 --> 54:40.680
CAMILLE: <i> You wanted</i> <i>Colin for yourself.</i>

54:40.720 --> 54:44.080
HUMPHREY: <i> And you were</i> <i>prepared to do anything</i>

54:40.720 --> 54:44.080
<i>possible to get him back.</i>

54:46.400 --> 54:49.720
You killed out of jealousy, pure and simple.

54:58.040 --> 55:00.280
I'm so sorry!

55:10.400 --> 55:11.720
Take her away.

55:33.560 --> 55:38.440
-I hear congratulations are in order.

55:33.560 --> 55:38.440
-Thank you, sir.

55:38.480 --> 55:41.720
But there was something else

55:38.480 --> 55:41.720
I wanted to say.

55:44.520 --> 55:48.120
A little bird tells me that your wife was here.

55:48.160 --> 55:50.520
Yes, sir.

55:50.560 --> 55:52.960
There was also talk of a reconciliation.

55:53.680 --> 55:55.440
Well, sir, um...

55:55.480 --> 55:58.480
I'd hate to lose you, Inspector.

55:58.520 --> 56:00.560
And I'm sure your team feels the same.

56:00.600 --> 56:03.920
Don't worry, sir. I'm not going anywhere.

56:03.960 --> 56:05.640
Well, not for the foreseeable future, anyway.

56:07.520 --> 56:10.400
Um, Sally and me, well, Sally and I...

56:11.320 --> 56:12.760
It's not really worked out, sir.

56:14.040 --> 56:15.720
Oh. I see.

56:16.840 --> 56:18.760
Then I am sorry for you.

56:20.920 --> 56:22.320
But I'm pleased for us.

56:25.160 --> 56:26.320
Same here.

56:37.360 --> 56:38.480
<i></i>

56:38.520 --> 56:41.280
Oh, hey! Who's for a dance, then?

56:41.320 --> 56:44.000
-That would be me, Dwayne Myers. Come on!

56:41.320 --> 56:44.000
-Oh, wow!

56:44.040 --> 56:46.840
-Me too! -Two for the price

56:44.040 --> 56:46.840
of one, eh?

56:48.240 --> 56:49.400
Yes, sir.

56:53.280 --> 56:56.880
I'm sorry, sir, about you and Mrs Goodman.

56:56.920 --> 56:59.880
Oh, don't be, Fidel. These things happen.

57:00.960 --> 57:03.440
Hmm. I must say I was surprised.

57:08.040 --> 57:11.080
-Yes, sir, I can.

57:11.120 --> 57:12.200
Well, the thing is,

57:12.240 --> 57:14.000
I was just about to change my mind

57:14.040 --> 57:16.000
and tell Sally that we should try

57:14.040 --> 57:16.000
and make another go of it,

57:16.040 --> 57:19.600
when I looked across the room and saw something.

57:21.000 --> 57:24.400
-Sergeant Camille Bordey.

57:31.640 --> 57:34.120
So, um, you...

57:34.160 --> 57:35.320
Love Camille?

57:36.680 --> 57:39.960
Well, yes, I think I very probably do.

57:42.040 --> 57:43.640
I don't know why it's taken me so long.

57:44.520 --> 57:45.760
I mean, look at her.

57:48.680 --> 57:49.800
She's wonderful.

57:51.720 --> 57:54.720
You know what, sir? You should tell her.

57:56.000 --> 58:00.000
Heavens, no. And risk spoiling all this?

58:00.040 --> 58:04.120
No, things are best left as they are.

58:07.040 --> 58:10.360
DWAYNE: Bye, bye, bye, bye,

58:07.040 --> 58:10.360
bye, bye, bye!

58:11.120 --> 58:12.440
That was great, eh?

58:13.520 --> 58:14.720
Everything okay?

58:14.760 --> 58:16.800
Yes, everything is just as it should be. Cheers.

58:16.840 --> 58:18.160
-ALL: Cheers! -Salut!

58:21.800 --> 58:22.920
DWAYNE: Beautiful!
