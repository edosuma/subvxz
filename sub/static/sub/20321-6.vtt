00:14.377 --> 00:16.311
May I help you, sir?

00:16.379 --> 00:19.781
The building manager...
Bill Simpson, called,

00:19.849 --> 00:21.783
said the fourth-floor
smoke detector died.

00:21.851 --> 00:25.419
Mr. Simpson... no, he didn't
tell me anything about it.

00:25.487 --> 00:30.090
And right now he's out having dinner, so
perhaps you can come back in an hour?

00:30.158 --> 00:33.327
Look, if a fire starts

00:33.395 --> 00:37.498
and the smoke detectors are
dead, it's not my fault.

00:37.566 --> 00:40.433
Ok, ok, just go ahead.

00:40.501 --> 00:42.902
Thank you.

00:44.605 --> 00:46.974
Mr. Deluca,
in your own words,

00:47.041 --> 00:50.110
take us through the events
of the night of October 11th,

00:50.178 --> 00:53.680
the night you saw with your own eyes Frank
Tedeschi shoot the victim in cold blood.

00:53.747 --> 00:55.815
Everything just happened
so fast, you know? I mean,

00:55.883 --> 00:58.750
- Frank just rolled up and pow!
- Ok, Dino, when you're on the stand,

00:58.818 --> 01:01.120
you need to take a lot more time
with it, ok?

01:01.188 --> 01:03.155
So just take a deep breath,
breathe through it, try again.

01:07.760 --> 01:11.030
- I remember leaving the club
at around 1:45 in the morning.

01:11.098 --> 01:13.098
I was heading to my car
in the parking lot.

01:13.165 --> 01:15.566
- That's when I saw Ade.
- No, full names please.

01:15.634 --> 01:20.205
- Uh, Adriano Valentine, the victim.
- Good.

01:20.272 --> 01:24.042
He was at the side of the club,
in an alleyway, just smoking.

02:05.314 --> 02:08.150
Tell us what happened next,
Mr. Deluca. And, Dino,

02:08.217 --> 02:11.153
this is where you can
really take your time with it.

02:11.220 --> 02:13.321
I heard footsteps.

02:13.389 --> 02:15.591
It was Frank Tedeschi.

02:15.659 --> 02:18.760
He had something in his hand.

02:18.827 --> 02:21.930
It was a gun.
He raised it up and...

02:21.997 --> 02:25.167
Ah!
(Gunshot)

02:27.203 --> 02:29.904
Shots fired! Repeat,
shots fired! Lock down the area.

02:29.972 --> 02:33.340
Get me an ambulance, now!

02:33.408 --> 02:35.443

03:04.675 --> 03:06.595
(Knocking on door)

03:06.878 --> 03:09.813
Hey, good morning, neighbour.

03:09.881 --> 03:12.685
You got any milk I can swipe from you?
I'm all out at my place.

03:12.805 --> 03:14.524
I can't believe
you're even asking.

03:14.644 --> 03:17.269
- Ah, life blood.
- Milk's in the fridge.

03:17.538 --> 03:20.473
Yeah, but I need it for my coffee. I
also recall I need some cereal too.

03:20.541 --> 03:21.979
Man, I had a rough night
last night.

03:22.099 --> 03:25.961
- Yeah? Late night?
- Yeah. That Sandy is a minx.

03:26.097 --> 03:28.932
Used my body like a damn
scratching post.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.835
- Organic Cranberry Flax Seed Crunch?
- It's Tia's.

03:32.903 --> 03:35.104
You're buying cereal
for tia now? Oh, boy,

03:35.172 --> 03:37.706
- that's a slippery slope.
- It's just a box of cereal, Oz.

03:37.774 --> 03:39.641
Next think you know,
you're making duplicate keys

03:39.709 --> 03:42.144
and getting wardrobe approval
before you leave the house.

03:42.212 --> 03:45.514
- Oz, it's just a box of cereal.
- It starts with a cereal box,

03:45.582 --> 03:47.816
and it ends with a moving box.

03:47.884 --> 03:50.419
No one's moving anywhere.
You know my situation.

03:50.487 --> 03:52.888
What, you mean your complete
emotional inavailability?

03:52.955 --> 03:54.990
- Good morning.
- Hey, wha... hey!

03:55.057 --> 03:58.560
- Morning, Oz.
- Tia, yes, hi. That is a great robe on you.

03:58.628 --> 04:01.296
Is that Toby's?
'Cause it's feminine and yet

04:01.364 --> 04:03.464
- has a sort of schlumpy...
- And the milk is in the fridge.

04:03.532 --> 04:06.033
Oh, I'm good for milk.
I'll get the... the yogurt.

04:06.101 --> 04:08.736
Why didn't I think of that?
Yogurt is much better.

04:08.804 --> 04:10.638
(Door closing)

04:10.706 --> 04:12.607
Coffee?

04:12.674 --> 04:14.609
I should get going.

04:14.676 --> 04:16.644
I'm just gonna cab it home
and shower there.

04:16.712 --> 04:19.413
- But you live across town.
- I don't want to push anything, Toby.

04:19.480 --> 04:24.150
- You might be late for work.
- Don't worry, it's no big deal.

04:31.492 --> 04:32.992
(Police radio chatter)

04:33.060 --> 04:35.028
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:35.095 --> 04:38.231
So, the victim's name is
Dina Deluca.

04:38.299 --> 04:40.266
- What's his story?
- He was picked up on a charge

04:40.334 --> 04:43.436
of laundering money for the mob.
It turns out he saw his boss,

04:43.503 --> 04:46.472
Frank Tedeschi, kill someone,
so he cut a deal to testify.

04:46.540 --> 04:48.507
Frank Tedeschi, huh?
I think I read about him.

04:48.575 --> 04:50.509
"The Cooler."
Nobody could catch him.

04:50.577 --> 04:52.777
- But she did.
- Yes, ma'am, he over there.

04:52.845 --> 04:55.613
That's Crown Prosecutor
Krista Ellis.

04:55.681 --> 04:57.615
From what I hear,
she's a force of nature.

04:57.683 --> 04:59.918
- You're Klein?
- I am.

04:59.986 --> 05:02.854
I'm responsible for the unit.
This is Sergeant McCluskey.

05:02.922 --> 05:04.823
She'll be running
the investigation.

05:04.890 --> 05:06.825
It's nice to meet you.
I hear you had a rough evening.

05:06.892 --> 05:09.226
It was fine until
someone shot my witness.

05:09.294 --> 05:11.963
What's his status? The bullet
perforated his left lung.

05:12.030 --> 05:14.298
He went in for surgery;
He's in the ICU now.

05:14.366 --> 05:17.301
As long as he lives long enough to testify.
You have a line on the shooter?

05:17.369 --> 05:20.537
No, not yet. We searched the place for
evidence, but turned up nothing as of yet.

05:20.605 --> 05:22.573
We're hoping we can get
a description from the doorman.

05:22.640 --> 05:25.509
I don't need the details; I just
need this guy off the street.

05:25.577 --> 05:29.113
Yes, my thought exactly. And if we can prove
the shooter was working for Frank Tedeschi,

05:29.181 --> 05:32.349
- you can have him for two shootings.
- I like the way you think, Mr. Klein.

05:32.416 --> 05:34.517
Just don't promise me
anything you can't deliver.

05:34.585 --> 05:36.186
We'll deliver.

05:36.253 --> 05:38.221
Good.

05:38.289 --> 05:40.957
Got a little hot in here.

05:41.025 --> 05:42.525
Get to work.

05:45.496 --> 05:50.299
<i>Dr. Wilson, dial 2-3-4.</i>
<i>Dr. Wilson, dial 2-3-4.</i>

05:53.769 --> 05:55.537
Mrs. Deluca?

05:55.605 --> 05:58.207
Maria.

05:58.274 --> 06:01.843
Special Consultant Logan. This is Sergeant
McCluskey. We're with the IIB. Can he talk?

06:01.911 --> 06:03.644
He mumbled a few things.

06:03.712 --> 06:05.513
He's still recovering

06:05.580 --> 06:07.915
from the surgery.

06:07.983 --> 06:12.153
The doctors said it was touch
and go, but he pushed through.

06:12.221 --> 06:15.256
Dino, we need to ask you a few
questions about this morning.

06:15.324 --> 06:18.858
Do you have any idea who did this to you?
Was it Frank Tedeschi?

06:26.934 --> 06:29.169
This whole trial hinges
on your testimony.

06:29.237 --> 06:31.671
We think Frank hired someone
to take you out.

06:31.739 --> 06:34.373
Do you know how they knew
where you were?

06:34.441 --> 06:37.676
Were you in contact with anyone
from the Tedeschi organization?

06:41.515 --> 06:44.216
Hey, uh, your dad's gonna be
all right.

06:44.284 --> 06:46.552
Ok? He's in very good
hands here.

06:53.692 --> 06:57.495
So, Tedeschi's a crime boss.
He's not what I pictured.

06:57.563 --> 07:00.432
He's young, he's got a babe
on each arm.

07:00.499 --> 07:02.600
He's the new face
of an old organization.

07:02.668 --> 07:05.803
Mm. "The leader of a new wave

07:05.871 --> 07:08.672
of organized crime."
What makes him so special?

07:08.739 --> 07:10.807
Well, for one, he studied law
at Osgoode Hall.

07:10.875 --> 07:12.876
- He's a lawyer?
- Almost.

07:12.944 --> 07:14.811
He dropped out
when his old man passed away

07:14.879 --> 07:16.813
and took over
the family business.

07:16.881 --> 07:19.316
But he knows
how not to get caught...

07:19.384 --> 07:22.785
Speaks in codes,
keeps himself insulated.

07:22.852 --> 07:24.653
Mm, like a "cooler".

07:24.721 --> 07:26.655
- Exactly.
- Right.

07:26.723 --> 07:29.158
Dev, what have we got?

07:29.226 --> 07:31.327
A facial composite
of our shooter.

07:31.395 --> 07:33.596
Seems our guy called ahead,
spoke to the building manager,

07:33.663 --> 07:35.598
and got enough info
to scam his way inside.

07:35.665 --> 07:37.933
Ok. Anything
from facial recognition?

07:38.001 --> 07:40.402
Nothing.
It's not in our database.

07:40.470 --> 07:42.437
- What about ballistics?
- Yeah, I have them,

07:42.505 --> 07:45.340
- it's somewhere here.
- It's a Dragunov.

07:45.408 --> 07:47.375
It's a Russian-made
semi-automatic marksman rifle,

07:47.443 --> 07:49.844
chambered in 7.62 by 54.
It's top of the line.

07:49.912 --> 07:52.780
Yeah. That's exactly
what I have here.

07:52.848 --> 07:54.748
Team, meet our guest
from down South. This is

07:54.816 --> 07:57.751
Special Agent John Burrows,
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

07:57.819 --> 08:00.321
Sergeant McCluskey,
Special Consultant Logan,

08:00.388 --> 08:02.689
- and Corporal Clark.
- How can we help you Agent Burrows?

08:02.757 --> 08:05.459
More about how I can help you. For
one thing, I can ID your shooter.

08:05.527 --> 08:07.528
This is the only known photo
of Tai Ling.

08:07.596 --> 08:09.696
Chinese Republican Army.
Top marksman.

08:09.764 --> 08:12.532
Discharged in '04. Makes his way over to
the US, where he's now one of the most

08:12.600 --> 08:14.667
sought after and highly paid
freelance hitters.

08:14.735 --> 08:17.247
Pretty old photo. How can you
be sure that's our guy?

08:17.367 --> 08:19.026
Same MO, same rifle.
It's your guy.

08:19.146 --> 08:20.773
I'm sorry, how does he
know about the shooting?

08:20.841 --> 08:24.444
My antenna was up. I tracked Ling
to Detroit where he fell off the map.

08:24.512 --> 08:26.845
I suspected he crossed
the border for a job, so I followed him.

08:26.912 --> 08:29.714
- Into our jurisdiction?
- That's right.

08:29.782 --> 08:32.583
He went through all
the proper channels, Michelle.

08:32.652 --> 08:35.220
I did. With your permission,
I'd like to piggyback this case.

08:35.288 --> 08:38.490
In my experience with the FBI, "piggyback"
is just another word for hijack.

08:38.558 --> 08:41.058
With all due respect, sergeant, aren't
you looking a gift horse in the mouth?

08:41.126 --> 08:43.461
Michelle. Sidebar.

08:48.200 --> 08:50.201
Save your breath.
It's a done deal.

08:50.269 --> 08:53.004
- Burrows is going to piggyback.
- How did this happen?

08:53.072 --> 08:55.473
How do you think?
Their suits talked to our suits,

08:55.541 --> 08:57.475
horses were traded,
backs were scratched.

08:57.543 --> 08:59.509
And whose back was scratched?
Martell?

08:59.577 --> 09:02.512
That woman collects political favors
like a kid collects comic books.

09:02.580 --> 09:05.482
The good news for you is that Burrows has
been working the Ling case for years.

09:05.550 --> 09:08.085
- He can be a real asset.
- Yeah, that's one word for him.

09:08.153 --> 09:10.954
Remember, you're driving
this investigation.

09:11.022 --> 09:13.623
He's in the backseat.
And Toby's, uh, "gift"?

09:13.692 --> 09:15.558
I'm supposed
to just keep that a secret?

09:15.625 --> 09:19.195
Well, you kept it from me
for a number of...

09:19.262 --> 09:21.497
You'll figure it out.

09:21.565 --> 09:23.766
What do you bring to the table?

09:23.867 --> 09:25.434
I'm a specialist...

09:25.502 --> 09:27.369
Muscle recognition,
lie detection.

09:27.437 --> 09:30.292
A face reader? What method
do you use? Denninger?

09:30.412 --> 09:33.075
No, no. I read the frequency
of lateral eye movement,

09:33.142 --> 09:35.610
the change in breath...
we call it the Logan method.

09:35.678 --> 09:38.213
They teach face reading at the
Bureau, but I'm not in for it.

09:38.280 --> 09:41.049
In my opinion, it's
a sideshow act. All due respect.

09:41.117 --> 09:44.186
So, looks like we're going
to be working together.

09:44.253 --> 09:46.171
Great. Let's get started.
I've got a lot of ideas on how -

09:46.291 --> 09:49.023
Yeah, I bet you do, and I can't
wait to hear all of them. Right now

09:49.091 --> 09:51.158
we're gonna go talk to Tedeschi.
He's under house arrest.

09:51.193 --> 09:55.662
Shouldn't we wait for the rest of your unit?
This is the unit.

09:55.731 --> 09:58.199
So, Burrows, you're the world's
leading expert on Tai Ling.

09:58.266 --> 10:00.300
- What's he thinking right now?
- Ling's proud.

10:00.368 --> 10:02.569
He'll blame the botched hit
on equipment failure.

10:02.637 --> 10:04.637
He'll recalibrate,
buy new equipment.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.539
- (Dev): Guys.
- If I were running

10:06.607 --> 10:08.608
this investigation,
I'd be working that angle.

10:08.675 --> 10:11.410
Dev, check out the gun ranges
of black market dealers.

10:11.530 --> 10:12.388
Ok, will do.

10:12.508 --> 10:14.714
Like it or not, Burrows,
I'm in charge of this unit,

10:14.782 --> 10:17.383
so when we go talk to Tedeschi,
you hang back and listen.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.317
- Understood?
- Yes, ma'am.

10:19.385 --> 10:21.419
Oh, good timing. Nice.

10:25.225 --> 10:26.925
Nice boots.

10:33.099 --> 10:35.900
Look, I read the paper,
I read the lies about me,

10:35.968 --> 10:38.688
but I can only concern myself
with what I know to be true.

10:38.808 --> 10:40.352
I'm a legitimate businessman.

10:40.472 --> 10:44.142
By legitimate, you mean running your
father's criminal organization?

10:44.209 --> 10:48.112
My father, rest in peace, was accused of
some questionable activities, sure. Me?

10:48.180 --> 10:50.714
Never committed a crime
in my life.

10:50.782 --> 10:54.450
- I stay far away from trouble.
- I saw they put a bullet in your leg in '07.

10:54.518 --> 10:56.837
You must not be very good at staying
away from trouble.

10:56.957 --> 10:59.756
Well, what can I say? I was in the wrong
place at the wrong time. Who is this guy?

10:59.824 --> 11:02.092
Agent Burrows is assisting
in this investigation.

11:02.160 --> 11:04.995
Look, we don't want
to waste your time, ok?

11:05.062 --> 11:07.429
This is a photo of the shooter.
Name's Tai Ling.

11:07.497 --> 11:11.233
- Do you recognize him?
<i>- Number Four.</i>

11:11.301 --> 11:13.702
Great. Never seen the guy before
in my life.

11:13.770 --> 11:18.240
You of all people should know, if you want
to cut a deal, you need to start talking.

11:18.308 --> 11:21.143
Who the hell OK'ed this?
Huh? Who?!

11:21.211 --> 11:23.645
- I don't know!
- Didn't I say not now?

11:23.713 --> 11:26.915
I told you, I don't know
anything about this shooting.

11:26.982 --> 11:30.018
I have no reason to be afraid of
Dino Deluca. The man is a liar,

11:30.085 --> 11:32.454
and my lawyer over here is going
to pick his story apart.

11:32.522 --> 11:34.956
I did not shoot my friend
Adriano,

11:35.024 --> 11:37.926
and I damn sure didn't hire
this Tai Ling.

11:37.993 --> 11:42.430
- I'm a businessman. I don't order hits.
- Come on, Frank.

11:42.497 --> 11:45.232
According to your file, you're suspected
of ordering more than a dozen hits.

11:45.300 --> 11:46.734
You know what you can do
with that file, right?

11:46.802 --> 11:48.969
- No. Why don't you show me?
- Ok, we're done here.

11:49.037 --> 11:51.119
- Show me.
- Burrows.

11:51.239 --> 11:52.446
She's calling you.

11:56.844 --> 11:58.378
Thank you.

12:00.348 --> 12:02.982
So, he lied. He knows Ling.
He calls him "Number Four".

12:03.050 --> 12:05.117
Tedeschi speaks in codes,
so maybe we can use that.

12:05.185 --> 12:07.119
So, you get some good
face reads?

12:07.187 --> 12:09.121
I did. Yeah.
Tedeschi told his boys

12:09.189 --> 12:11.490
to leave Dino alone, at least
until the trial was over.

12:11.558 --> 12:14.360
You got that from some lateral eye
movements? He's gotta be kidding me.

12:14.427 --> 12:15.799
What the hell were you doing
in there?

12:15.919 --> 12:17.530
Hey, all due respect,
I'm not going to sit on my hands

12:17.650 --> 12:19.341
and watch the Logan method guide
this investigation.

12:19.461 --> 12:21.050
- What kind of unit is this?
- This unit has the best

12:21.170 --> 12:24.218
solve ratio out of any Federal
Police Agency, so you can either

12:24.338 --> 12:26.572
go back to your hotel room
and hang out by yourself,

12:26.639 --> 12:29.040
or you can ride with us
and stick with the program.

12:29.108 --> 12:31.076
Understood.

12:31.843 --> 12:34.912
Ling was just made talking
to a gun dealer in Chinatown.

12:34.980 --> 12:37.281
We're gonna drop you off there
to see what you can find out.

12:37.348 --> 12:40.985
Yeah. Well, I am down
with the program, ma'am.

12:41.053 --> 12:44.020
- I think she likes me.
- Get in the car, Burrows.

12:51.219 --> 12:53.186
- So, what've you got?
- Well, we know Tedeschi speaks

12:53.254 --> 12:55.788
in codes. We think that we have
the one he uses for Ling.

12:55.856 --> 12:57.756
Yeah, I searched back
through the wiretaps

12:57.824 --> 13:01.327
that you provided us with,
and I think I found something.

13:01.394 --> 13:03.462
<i>Want to order Number Four?</i>

13:03.529 --> 13:06.398
<i>Go to the main.</i>
<i>They make a Number Four.</i>

13:06.466 --> 13:08.600
Twenty-four hours later,
a rival gang member was murdered

13:08.668 --> 13:10.736
by a sniper using a Dragunov,

13:10.803 --> 13:13.271
so if ordering a Number Four
means hiring Ling,

13:13.339 --> 13:15.805
then all we have to do is find
out where the main is.

13:15.925 --> 13:19.777
Not where, who.
Elio Bruni.

13:19.845 --> 13:21.913
Often referred to as the main.
Does Tedeschi's dirty work.

13:21.981 --> 13:26.450
He's ambitious. Recently moved
up in the organization.

13:26.518 --> 13:29.186
Now he's right up at the top,
near the throne.

13:29.254 --> 13:31.154
Well, is it possible
this guy hired Ling?

13:31.222 --> 13:33.556
Anything's possible, but don't
take your focus off Tedeschi.

13:33.624 --> 13:35.525
I've gone through a lot
to get him where I want him.

13:35.593 --> 13:37.594
I can't have him passing
the blame off on an underling.

13:37.661 --> 13:42.165
- Understood.
- I'll leave it with you.

13:42.233 --> 13:44.367
Have a good day.

13:44.434 --> 13:47.390
She's not gonna want to hear this,
but I got Elio on a read.

13:47.510 --> 13:48.790
I think we should talk to him.

13:48.910 --> 13:50.572
Let's make it happen.

14:06.055 --> 14:08.223
(Phone ringing)

14:14.096 --> 14:17.831
Yes.

14:17.899 --> 14:20.000
I understand.

14:20.068 --> 14:22.602
I'm gonna make it right.
Don't call again.

14:29.710 --> 14:32.511
Klein.

14:32.579 --> 14:35.048
I think your team might be
sniffing around the wrong trees.

14:35.115 --> 14:38.117
Losing faith already?

14:38.185 --> 14:41.220
I want the man who shot my witness.
I don't do patience.

14:41.288 --> 14:43.156
I get it.
It's an important case,

14:43.223 --> 14:46.659
and you want to know
it's under control. And it is...

14:46.726 --> 14:49.894
As much as it can be.
Trust me.

14:49.963 --> 14:53.365
Is it true what they say
about you?

14:53.433 --> 14:55.033
What do they say about me?

14:55.101 --> 14:57.002
No matter what people throw
at you,

14:57.070 --> 14:58.937
you always wind up on top.

14:59.005 --> 15:00.439
(He laughs.)

15:00.506 --> 15:03.408
Um, I don't play to lose.

15:03.476 --> 15:06.344
You know, you have
your own reputation.

15:06.411 --> 15:08.012
Do I?

15:08.080 --> 15:10.681
They say that you always get
your man.

15:10.748 --> 15:12.649
Well...

15:12.717 --> 15:15.219
I guess that's
to be determined.

15:17.689 --> 15:19.890
Why don't we be in touch later?

15:19.958 --> 15:23.759
You can keep me updated
on the case.

15:23.827 --> 15:27.397
Yeah. I'll, uh...
I'll call you.

15:34.605 --> 15:37.639
My client is here
as a gesture of goodwill.

15:37.707 --> 15:40.209
He's a respected businessman
and a pillar of his community.

15:40.276 --> 15:43.045
Your client has been arrested
half a dozen times on charges

15:43.113 --> 15:46.315
ranging from racketeering
to grievous assault. Please sit.

15:46.383 --> 15:48.384
And never convicted.
Not once.

15:52.488 --> 15:54.122
The goodwill clock's running,

15:54.189 --> 15:56.357
so if you ask my client
a question I don't like...

15:56.425 --> 15:58.893
Yeah, I get it. We understand
that you're friends

15:58.960 --> 16:01.762
- with Frank Tedeschi?
- Yeah, I know him, if that's what you mean.

16:01.830 --> 16:04.098
What about Adriano Valentine?
Is he friends with Frank?

16:04.166 --> 16:05.966
Frank's a very popular guy.

16:06.035 --> 16:08.701
And here's to you, Frankie.

16:08.769 --> 16:12.506
May the gods' of wealth
and success keep smiling on ya.

16:12.573 --> 16:15.509
Are you going somewhere
with this?

16:15.576 --> 16:18.045
We're just trying to figure
out who's friends with who.

16:18.112 --> 16:19.979
Tedeschi's off the table.
Move on.

16:20.048 --> 16:22.549
Ok.

16:24.584 --> 16:28.887
- You ever seen this guy before?
- Never seen him before.

16:34.561 --> 16:37.877
So, Elio, you're saying
you've never spoken to Ling?

16:37.997 --> 16:39.532
That money's never
changed hands?

16:39.599 --> 16:41.699
Do not respond
to that question.

16:41.767 --> 16:44.602
Meter's expired.
Let's go, Elio.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.804
We know you're the man
with the hookup, Elio.

16:46.872 --> 16:49.140
We just need to know
how to order a Number Four.

16:49.208 --> 16:51.976
You ordered a Number Four,
didn't you?

16:52.044 --> 16:54.245
Yeah, yeah, I can hook you up.

16:54.313 --> 16:57.013
I'll get him to call you.

16:57.082 --> 17:00.317
Next time you want to talk to my
client, you'll need a warrant.

17:07.092 --> 17:10.026
I saw a web page.
I got a partial on the logo.

17:10.095 --> 17:12.761
Looked something like that.
A whirlpool with a mouth?

17:12.829 --> 17:15.064
That looks like the daughter
of Hades and Poseidon.

17:15.132 --> 17:16.632
That's Charybdis.

17:16.700 --> 17:18.300
You know Greek mythology?

17:18.367 --> 17:20.303
- No. I know Internet.
- Ah.

17:20.369 --> 17:23.071
- Right.
- Look.

17:23.140 --> 17:26.509
This is Charybdis, the most
anonymous subnet on the web.

17:26.577 --> 17:29.177
It's an underground haven
for hackers, phreaks,

17:29.245 --> 17:30.778
and all-around baddies.

17:30.846 --> 17:32.847
Its activity is untraceable.
It's impossible

17:32.915 --> 17:35.683
- for law enforcement to get past this page.
- Ok, well, if it's impossible...

17:35.751 --> 17:39.721
Well, they stole the coding for the
firewall from a certain handsome

17:39.788 --> 17:42.023
yet humble
underground hacker: Me.

17:42.091 --> 17:44.731
There's two things to know:
One, I always leave a back door,

17:44.851 --> 17:47.513
and two, karma is a bitch.

17:50.432 --> 17:52.399
Do you know what?

17:52.467 --> 17:54.335
I think I might know
Ling's handle.

17:54.402 --> 17:56.004
Try "Friend, underscore,

17:56.071 --> 17:59.273
In, underscore, Need".

18:02.409 --> 18:04.678
- Ok, that could be him.
- Yeah, look at the characters

18:04.746 --> 18:08.148
on the side. The sequencing is consistent.
It's two sets of three, and then four.

18:08.268 --> 18:09.168
Phone numbers.

18:09.288 --> 18:10.717
- Yeah.
- Burner phones.

18:10.785 --> 18:14.021
If we can find the most recent
one, we can maybe find our guy.

18:14.088 --> 18:17.456
Ok, I got one in Seattle.
It's dead.

18:17.524 --> 18:21.027
Got one from Detroit.

18:21.094 --> 18:24.557
It's dead. Ok, here, I got one
from Toronto.

18:24.677 --> 18:26.431
- It was activated this morning.
- Ok, when you get the location,

18:26.499 --> 18:30.036
text it to me. Call ETF and have them meet
us at the scene. We'll go pick up Burrows.

18:38.477 --> 18:39.944
Beautiful night, huh?

18:40.012 --> 18:41.980
How'd it go
with the gun dealer?

18:42.048 --> 18:45.216
Nothing concrete, but it seems that
Ling's been doing some restocking.

18:45.284 --> 18:49.019
He's picked up some ammo for the Dragunov, and
he's added a Sig, a shotgun, and some knives.

18:49.139 --> 18:49.981
That's pretty serious.

18:50.101 --> 18:53.456
He missed the first time.
He won't miss again.

18:53.524 --> 18:56.727
What have we got? We got the room number
of the guy who fits our description:

18:56.795 --> 18:59.329
237. Night manager thinks
he's in there now.

18:59.397 --> 19:01.999
- All right. Let's do this.
- No. We wait for tactical.

19:02.067 --> 19:03.934
Been there, done that.
I almost had him in Denver

19:04.002 --> 19:05.723
but I lost him. I did not come
this far to lose him again.

19:05.843 --> 19:07.794
Burrows, if your intel is right,
he's got a lot of firepower.

19:07.914 --> 19:09.161
We can't take him on our own.

19:09.281 --> 19:10.973
No, I can.
It's not my first rodeo.

19:11.041 --> 19:14.443
We wait for tactical.

19:14.511 --> 19:17.213
- Toby, can I have a minute?
- Yeah.

19:19.041 --> 19:20.610
So, when they get here...

19:20.730 --> 19:22.632
I know the drill.
You can save your breath.

19:22.752 --> 19:24.686
Burrows!

19:33.863 --> 19:35.997
What the hell are you doing?
I told you to wait.

19:36.065 --> 19:37.998
Wait if you want,
but I'm going in.

19:38.066 --> 19:39.666
You can't go in alone.

19:39.735 --> 19:41.969
Then watch my six.

19:54.749 --> 19:56.549
(Scanning)

19:59.887 --> 20:02.088
(Scanning)

20:14.367 --> 20:15.968
(Cell phone ringing)

20:16.035 --> 20:17.936
Yeah?

20:18.004 --> 20:21.039
[Michelle, don't open
the door! It's booby-trapped!]

20:21.107 --> 20:23.275
(Gunshot)

20:33.312 --> 20:36.246
Tai Ling in a nutshell...
Simple, deadly,

20:36.314 --> 20:38.781
impossible to predict.
But somehow you knew.

20:38.849 --> 20:42.285
From the ground level, without ever seeing
the door, you knew it was booby trapped.

20:42.353 --> 20:44.921
- How is that exactly?
- I saw Ling in his car.

20:44.989 --> 20:47.390
I got a good look at his face,
and I had a feeling.

20:47.458 --> 20:51.129
- Don't tell me. The Logan method.
- You're welcome.

20:51.678 --> 20:54.545
So, Ling paid the manager
a couple hundred dollars

20:54.613 --> 20:56.581
to warn him if anyone came
looking for him.

20:56.648 --> 20:58.616
It's Denver all over again.
We should have acted faster.

20:58.684 --> 21:01.152
I'm sorry, are you actually
trying to blame this on me?

21:01.220 --> 21:03.254
It's not about blame,
it's about the facts,

21:03.322 --> 21:04.871
and the fact is, sergeant, you
overthought this.

21:04.991 --> 21:06.045
Excuse me?

21:06.165 --> 21:07.754
Look, we wasted 60 seconds
arguing about what to do,

21:07.874 --> 21:09.565
gave Ling enough time
to get out of the room.

21:09.685 --> 21:12.299
No. He already had the gun set up. A
minute earlier, and we would be dead.

21:12.419 --> 21:14.177
- We almost had him.
- We almost got killed.

21:14.297 --> 21:16.539
All right, are you guys done?
Ling was here, in this room,

21:16.659 --> 21:18.536
which means we're close.
We can get this guy,

21:18.604 --> 21:21.339
but we gotta pull
in the same direction.

21:29.714 --> 21:31.598
You guys want the good news,
or the bad news?

21:31.718 --> 21:32.597
Good news.

21:32.717 --> 21:36.186
All right, I got the call history on Ling's
burner phone. He only received one call,

21:36.254 --> 21:38.322
from a place called The
Journey's End, on Atlas Drive.

21:38.390 --> 21:40.656
- Atlas Drive, where's that?
- You turn left at the airport,

21:40.724 --> 21:42.658
you keep driving till you hit
the middle of nowhere.

21:42.726 --> 21:45.161
It's a perfect place to
sequester a family in Wit-Pro...

21:45.229 --> 21:47.763
- Like Deluca's family.
- So, wait, the call to Ling

21:47.831 --> 21:50.027
came from the same place
where Deluca's family is?

21:50.147 --> 21:51.120
Simplest explanation is

21:51.240 --> 21:53.736
it's one of the guards. They're all kept
in the loop on the unit's movements,

21:53.803 --> 21:55.242
so if one of them's
working with Ling...

21:55.362 --> 21:56.464
But we don't actually think that
Ling's going to make

21:56.584 --> 21:58.059
a move on Deluca's family, do we?

21:58.179 --> 21:59.229
No way. That's not his style.

21:59.349 --> 22:01.369
Ok, well, we're not gonna
take any chances.

22:01.489 --> 22:03.745
I want to replace the police
detail with our guys.

22:03.812 --> 22:06.066
Bring Deluca's family
into IIB holding, ok?

22:06.186 --> 22:07.063
Ok.

22:10.253 --> 22:12.808
Why don't you go home,
get some rest?

22:12.928 --> 22:14.507
- Will you give me a ride?
- Yes. Come on.

22:14.627 --> 22:15.440
Thank you.

22:28.835 --> 22:30.769
Thanks for dropping me at home.

22:30.837 --> 22:32.804
Please. That's the least
I could do.

22:32.873 --> 22:35.474
Thank you for meeting with me
to discuss the case.

22:35.541 --> 22:38.944
Well, I have no problems mixing
business with a little bit of pleasure,

22:39.012 --> 22:43.182
especially with a man who knows
his way around the wine list.

22:43.250 --> 22:45.383
I just pick by price point.

22:45.450 --> 22:48.052
You know, I was just trying
to impress you.

22:48.120 --> 22:50.955
(Cell phone ringing) Uh, sorry.

22:55.527 --> 22:58.129
Michelle thinks that someone
inside the police detail

22:58.197 --> 23:01.631
might be compromised, possibly feeding Ling
information about Deluca and his family.

23:01.699 --> 23:03.867
No, no, I vetted those men
myself.

23:03.935 --> 23:06.569
Still, we should do our due diligence.
We should check those men again.

23:06.637 --> 23:08.571
I don't want you to take
your eyes off the prize, Alvin.

23:08.639 --> 23:11.474
The case is Tedeschi.
He hired the shooter.

23:11.542 --> 23:13.576
How hard can it be
to get me proof?

23:13.644 --> 23:16.345
Agent Burrows said that Ling's
going rate is a hundred grand.

23:16.413 --> 23:18.915
We've been all over Tedeschi's
financials. There's no sign of...

23:18.982 --> 23:21.483
I don't care how you do it,
just get me something. Anything.

23:25.055 --> 23:27.256
I'm sorry. That was...

23:27.324 --> 23:29.258
lack of sleep, looming trial...

23:29.326 --> 23:32.460
- makes me very cranky.
- Please, don't apologize.

23:32.528 --> 23:34.429
I've been there.

23:35.932 --> 23:37.866
You know, Alvin, um,

23:37.934 --> 23:41.336
it just so happens that I have

23:41.404 --> 23:43.204
a 2003 Bordeaux

23:43.272 --> 23:45.607
from St. Julien

23:45.675 --> 23:47.842
just sitting on my shelf.

23:47.910 --> 23:49.877
That's a hundred-dollar bottle
of wine.

23:49.945 --> 23:52.947
Are you tempted?

23:54.983 --> 23:57.184
Tart fruits, violets,
hint of cedar,

23:57.252 --> 24:00.454
long, robust finish.

24:00.522 --> 24:04.490
I could be convinced.

24:15.570 --> 24:17.871
Where are you drifting to?

24:17.939 --> 24:20.405
I can see the wheels turning
up there.

24:20.473 --> 24:23.075
It's this Deluca case.

24:23.142 --> 24:25.952
- We're hitting brick walls.
- Doesn't surprise me.

24:26.072 --> 24:27.529
This whole case stinks.

24:27.649 --> 24:30.686
 I should not be talking about
an open investigation with you.

24:30.806 --> 24:33.518
 I'm not talking about the open
investigation; 

24:33.587 --> 24:36.520
I'm talking about the one
that's supposedly closed.

24:38.991 --> 24:41.626
The Tedeschi murder trial?

24:41.694 --> 24:45.463
You don't think it's weird
that a man so calculating would

24:45.530 --> 24:47.498
shoot someone so carelessly?

24:47.566 --> 24:49.500
Prosecutor Ellis seems
to think he did.

24:49.568 --> 24:51.002
Oh, Ellis.

24:51.070 --> 24:53.737
She hasn't broken bread
with mob bosses. I have.

24:53.805 --> 24:55.806
Word on the street is

24:55.873 --> 24:58.408
that Tedeschi had no beef

24:58.476 --> 25:00.944
with Valentine. He loved him
like a brother.

25:01.012 --> 25:05.415
Well, it is kinda hard to see why
he'd kill somebody he loved so much.

25:05.483 --> 25:07.050
But?

25:07.118 --> 25:10.285
But that's not our case,
you know?

25:10.353 --> 25:12.287
It's not the case
we're working on.

25:12.355 --> 25:14.523
You don't know that for sure.

25:14.591 --> 25:16.892
(Cell phone ringing)

25:16.960 --> 25:19.895
It's probably work.

25:19.963 --> 25:23.698
Yeah, it's Michelle.
What? Tia, I got...

25:23.766 --> 25:27.401
(Toby): <I>- Hey. What's up?</I>
- I'm at the hospital.

25:27.469 --> 25:30.505
Deluca's awake now. He can talk.
Do you want to meet me here?

25:30.572 --> 25:32.874
- <i>Yeah, I'll be there in 20.</i>
- Ok, great.

25:34.844 --> 25:37.779
- Hey. Where are you going?
- Home.

25:37.899 --> 25:39.187
Home? Why?

25:39.307 --> 25:42.249
Because I don't think you're comfortable
having me stay over.

25:42.316 --> 25:44.652
Oh, no, no, I apologize, ok?
What you heard me say to Oz,

25:44.719 --> 25:47.187
that's... that's complicated,
all right?

25:47.255 --> 25:50.323
I just have a lot of bad luck
with relationships.

25:50.391 --> 25:53.093
But not to say I'm gonna have
bad luck with you.

25:53.161 --> 25:55.529
It's ok. You know what?
Sometimes things can

25:55.596 --> 25:58.531
move too fast, so let's
just keep it casual.

25:58.598 --> 26:00.033
Ok.

26:00.100 --> 26:02.168
Don't want your friends
to get the wrong idea.

26:07.708 --> 26:09.709
Nothing here, sir.

26:09.777 --> 26:13.244
I want these seats
out of here. Pop the trunk.

26:20.619 --> 26:22.154
Anything?

26:22.221 --> 26:25.123
No, sir.

26:25.191 --> 26:28.258
So, Dev and I pored over the police detail.
Nothing. They're good.

26:28.326 --> 26:29.994
- Anything from Burrows?
- Yeah, he's working

26:30.062 --> 26:32.362
with forensics right now.
They recovered Ling's vehicle,

26:32.430 --> 26:34.631
searched it for evidence,
but nothing. Ling's good.

26:34.700 --> 26:37.501
- You ok? You seem distracted.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

26:37.569 --> 26:39.603
Let's talk to Deluca.

26:41.539 --> 26:43.107
Dino?

26:45.076 --> 26:46.810
Hi. We were here earlier.

26:46.877 --> 26:49.012
- You may not remember us.
- No, I don't.

26:49.080 --> 26:52.348
We wanted to show you
the shooter.

26:52.416 --> 26:56.019
That's him? That's the guy
Tedeschi hired to shoot me?

26:56.087 --> 26:58.054
Well, we haven't been able
to prove that Tedeschi was

26:58.122 --> 27:00.422
- the one who hired him.
- Then who the hell did?

27:00.489 --> 27:02.487
We're not sure. We're hoping that
you can help us with this.

27:02.607 --> 27:03.840
You were inside the operation.

27:03.960 --> 27:05.523
I handled some of the money.

27:05.643 --> 27:08.430
 I never hurt anyone. I never saw
anyone get hurt till that night.

27:08.497 --> 27:12.267
Tell us what you saw the night of the
shooting, October 11th. What did you see?

27:16.905 --> 27:18.740
Why do you want to know?

27:18.807 --> 27:21.809
- Why do you want to know?
- Just stay with me on this.

27:21.877 --> 27:24.545
It might have some relevance
to what's happened to you here.

27:24.613 --> 27:26.247
What did you see, Dino?

27:28.250 --> 27:30.384
Just like I said in the report.

27:30.452 --> 27:33.419
I was in the parking lot.
Ade was in the alley smoking,

27:33.487 --> 27:35.388
and Frank came
out of the shadows.

27:35.456 --> 27:37.624
- Did you see his face?
- Of course I saw his face.

27:37.691 --> 27:40.593
He raised the gun. Pow.
Ade went down.

27:47.101 --> 27:49.168
So, he was moving quickly.

27:51.138 --> 27:53.172
No. Tedeschi limps.

27:53.240 --> 27:55.775
- Can we talk for a minute?
- Yeah.

28:05.017 --> 28:06.951
Why are you asking
about a limp?

28:07.019 --> 28:09.687
The shooter ran from
the alleyway. No impediment.

28:09.755 --> 28:13.024
Ok, if you're right, then
Tedeschi didn't kill Valentine.

28:13.092 --> 28:16.795
And the prosecution's case is
a house of cards.

28:26.117 --> 28:27.246
What's your status, Burrows?

28:27.366 --> 28:30.012
I haven't been shot at yet,
so today's a good day.

28:30.855 --> 28:32.859
- Where are we at with Ling?
- He's gone to ground.

28:32.942 --> 28:35.242
Deluca's getting transferred to
the courthouse in a few hours.

28:35.310 --> 28:37.579
Ling will make his move then.
I'll be there waiting

28:37.646 --> 28:40.046
- with a SWAT team and a smile.
- Michelle?

28:40.114 --> 28:42.048
- Yeah.
- My office.

28:42.116 --> 28:44.417
- Walk me through this.
- Well, the police want Tedeschi

28:44.486 --> 28:46.386
for the murder,
but they can't make it stick.

28:46.454 --> 28:48.388
Right, so they bring in
everyone associated

28:48.456 --> 28:50.557
with the organization, including
Deluca, and they sweat him.

28:50.625 --> 28:52.593
And they find evidence
of money laundering.

28:52.660 --> 28:54.628
They use that as leverage,
plea him out, and put Deluca

28:54.696 --> 28:57.563
in Witness Protection as long
as he gives them Tedeschi.

28:57.631 --> 29:00.700
- So what's the problem?
- Deluca lied. He said he saw

29:00.767 --> 29:03.903
a man running from the scene, but
Tedeschi limps. You're sure?

29:03.971 --> 29:05.938
Yeah, we checked his medical
records. He's got severe

29:06.006 --> 29:08.608
nerve damage in his left leg.
There's no way he could've ran.

29:08.675 --> 29:10.810
Because if I go to the Crown
Prosecutor to tell her

29:10.878 --> 29:13.144
that her star witness is lying,
I'm gonna need proof.

29:13.212 --> 29:15.313
- We'll get you proof.
- I don't understand why Deluca

29:15.381 --> 29:17.482
makes that move. Why does he pin
murder on his boss? Just to skate

29:17.550 --> 29:19.737
- on the money laundering charge?
- Maybe he's making his move

29:19.857 --> 29:20.720
within the organization.

29:20.840 --> 29:23.388
Or maybe someone got to him,
an over-zealous cop.

29:23.455 --> 29:25.390
Someone from the Crown
Prosecutor's office...

29:25.457 --> 29:27.791
- Those are serious accusations.
- I know. I'm just saying

29:27.859 --> 29:31.461
- I think we need to reopen up the case.
- Three hours before the trial?

29:31.530 --> 29:32.591
You do know what you're saying?

29:32.711 --> 29:34.212
Yes, I do. And I know it's not
the smart career move,

29:34.332 --> 29:36.227
but I think we have to do
the right thing here.

29:36.347 --> 29:39.436
That's if you think that clearing
Tedeschi's name is the right thing to do.

29:39.504 --> 29:41.405
That's not our decision
to make.

29:41.472 --> 29:43.473
The question before us is this:

29:43.541 --> 29:45.642
if Tedeschi isn't the shooter,
then who is?

29:45.709 --> 29:49.012
Find me the answer
to that question. Quickly.

29:51.015 --> 29:53.016
Ok, let's go back
to the basics here.

29:53.083 --> 29:55.368
Who was there the night of the murder
and who had the motive?

29:55.488 --> 29:58.610
- Well, I think Tedeschi's off the table.
- And so is Deluca.

29:58.730 --> 30:01.326
- Ellis said Elio had a lot of ambition.
- A lots of people do,

30:01.446 --> 30:04.059
but that doesn't make them
automatically murderers.

30:04.126 --> 30:06.494
But when I read him
I had this feeling.

30:06.563 --> 30:08.848
I don't know, just the way he watched
Tedeschi treat Adriano with so much

30:08.968 --> 30:10.046
respect and trust.

30:10.166 --> 30:12.000
It's like he envied him.

30:12.068 --> 30:14.302
- He wanted his spot at the top.
- Dev, I know

30:14.370 --> 30:16.904
the police already looked at
Elio as a possible suspect but...

30:16.972 --> 30:20.407
I know what you're going to say. I'll reopen
the case and see if they missed anything.

30:20.475 --> 30:22.009
Great.

30:32.486 --> 30:35.055
So, Tedeschi really is
the new face of organized crime.

30:35.122 --> 30:37.757
File says he finished top 5%
at Osgoode Hall.

30:37.825 --> 30:40.827
Yeah, he was on his way to becoming
a top-flight criminal lawyer,

30:40.895 --> 30:43.229
and then he gave it all up
to join the family business.

30:43.297 --> 30:45.264
Well, his old man died. Maybe
he felt it was an obligation.

30:45.332 --> 30:47.801
Yeah, I just don't understand
how you go from studying law

30:47.868 --> 30:50.169
to becoming a mob boss.
I don't get that mental switch.

30:50.237 --> 30:52.271
What's the difference between
a lawyer and a gangster?

30:52.339 --> 30:55.508
- Trick question, don't answer that.
- I just think there are

30:55.576 --> 30:58.511
certain lines you do not cross,
even if it is for family.

30:58.579 --> 31:01.380
Is that right? You went
pretty far for your old man.

31:01.500 --> 31:02.776
I never broke the law.

31:02.896 --> 31:04.983
Well, the line is different
for everyone. Take Tedeschi.

31:05.050 --> 31:07.119
He probably thinks
he's never crossed the line.

31:07.186 --> 31:10.422
And, for a mob boss, he's kept
his hands pretty clean.

31:10.490 --> 31:14.092
That's because he has soldiers like
Elio doing the dirty work for him.

31:18.431 --> 31:21.832
Go inside now. Go. Go.

31:21.899 --> 31:24.301
Got my lawyer on speed-dial.

31:24.369 --> 31:26.670
It's Elio.
Get over to the house, ASAP.

31:26.738 --> 31:28.872
The IIB is harassing me.

31:28.940 --> 31:31.208
Oh, relax. We just want
to talk to you for a minute.

31:31.276 --> 31:33.477
- I got nothing to say to you.
- We're just curious, Elio.

31:33.545 --> 31:35.546
Yeah? About what?

31:35.614 --> 31:38.714
Why you shot Adriano Valentine.

31:38.782 --> 31:41.117
Let me tell you a little
something about Valentine,

31:41.185 --> 31:44.654
my blood brother. I would go to
the ends of the earth for you.

31:44.721 --> 31:47.624
You insane, pal? I had no beef
with Valentine. I liked the guy.

31:47.691 --> 31:50.693
But he had what you wanted. He was closer
to the throne, the money, the power.

31:50.761 --> 31:53.828
You killed Valentine
to move closer to Tedeschi.

31:53.896 --> 31:56.998
But now Tedeschi's going down for
the murder. Wasn't smart planning, was it?

31:57.066 --> 31:59.930
Keeping your old friend Dino from
talking is gonna get him killed.

32:00.050 --> 32:00.761
Shut up. 

32:00.881 --> 32:03.529
You're the one who's going
to make those children fatherless.

32:03.649 --> 32:04.834
If you cared at all...

32:04.954 --> 32:07.176
You've got no idea.
I care about that family.

32:07.243 --> 32:10.344
Yeah, if you cared,
you'd do something about it.

32:10.412 --> 32:12.880
I can't take it anymore.
It has to stop.

32:12.947 --> 32:16.850
I can put you in touch with a guy.
He can solve this problem.

32:16.918 --> 32:18.986
That's my lawyer.
He's on his way.

32:19.054 --> 32:21.422
Ciao.

32:25.059 --> 32:28.061
So, he gave the Ling hookup
to Dino's wife Maria.

32:28.128 --> 32:31.064
What? She hired Ling
to kill her husband?

32:31.131 --> 32:33.333
That's what I'm thinking.

32:37.271 --> 32:40.239
In my read, I saw Maria
outside Elio's house.

32:40.307 --> 32:42.708
It was late at night.
Looked like she had been crying.

32:42.775 --> 32:45.077
Think there's something going
on between the two of them?

32:45.144 --> 32:47.713
No, no. That wasn't the vibe
at all. It was more desperate,

32:47.780 --> 32:49.814
like she had nowhere else to go.
She said she couldn't take it

32:49.934 --> 32:51.331
anymore, that it had to stop.

32:51.451 --> 32:53.519
- What had to stop?
- Well, you gotta think

32:53.587 --> 32:55.621
Tedeschi was probably
threatening the family.

32:55.689 --> 32:58.724
So, she goes to Elio,
he gives her the hookup to Ling.

32:58.791 --> 33:01.392
She thinks we're so busy looking
at Tedeschi that we would

33:01.460 --> 33:03.729
never even consider her
to be a suspect.

33:03.796 --> 33:07.132
And once the dust settles, she goes
to Tedeschi and says, "You owe me".

33:07.200 --> 33:09.400
- And he sets her up for life.
- It's a strong motive.

33:09.468 --> 33:11.468
She gets rid of Dino and
all her problems go away.

33:11.588 --> 33:12.684
So does her husband.

33:12.804 --> 33:14.972
Well, a lot of women kill
their husbands.

33:15.040 --> 33:17.108
I don't know,
maybe if the wives hate

33:17.175 --> 33:20.111
their husbands.
Did you get that vibe from her?

33:20.178 --> 33:22.613
Not necessarily, no, but I got
the sense that she's a smart

33:22.680 --> 33:25.582
woman and that she would do
anything to protect her kids.

33:35.993 --> 33:38.628
What's going on? Is Dino ok?

33:38.695 --> 33:40.663
- Did something happen?
- No, he's fine.

33:40.731 --> 33:42.932
We just need
to ask you a few questions

33:43.000 --> 33:44.667
about you and Dino.

33:44.735 --> 33:47.836
About us?
What do you want to know?

33:47.904 --> 33:50.305
Would you say that you two
have a happy marriage?

33:50.373 --> 33:52.574
Yes. I love my husband.

33:52.642 --> 33:55.844
He's a good man and a very good father.
Why are you asking me this?

33:55.912 --> 33:58.446
Why'd you hire a man
to kill him?

33:58.514 --> 34:03.417
Don't tell me to calm down.
You missed the goddamn target.

34:06.822 --> 34:09.900
Maria, we know you called the shooter
from the Journey's End.

34:10.021 --> 34:11.650
You think I called him?
Why would I do that?

34:11.770 --> 34:12.768
That's what we want to know.

34:12.889 --> 34:14.761
Well, you're asking
the wrong person.

34:14.880 --> 34:16.610
 I think I need to
get back to my kids.

34:16.731 --> 34:18.980
We know you hired
a man to kill your husband.

34:19.100 --> 34:20.934
The father of my children?

34:21.002 --> 34:23.402
Do you think I want to make them
fatherless? Don't you get it?

34:23.469 --> 34:25.906
All I want is
for my kids to be safe.

34:25.973 --> 34:29.074
(Ellis): - You tell your husband to play ball.
- Leave me alone.

34:29.143 --> 34:32.578
If you care about your children,
don't think I'm bluffing.

34:34.647 --> 34:37.416
We know you've been through
a lot. We're here to help you.

34:37.483 --> 34:39.583
- We know you've been threatened.
- What do you know about that?

34:39.652 --> 34:42.120
We know the Crown Prosecutor
threatened you and your family.

34:49.395 --> 34:53.031
She said Dino
wasn't being smart.

34:53.098 --> 34:55.933
She said it was up to me to talk
sense into Dino, to make him say

34:56.000 --> 34:59.136
- what she wanted him to say.
- Or what?

34:59.204 --> 35:02.072
She'd tell Tedeschi's people
where we were hidden.

35:02.140 --> 35:05.643
- And if you refused?
- She'd go to Children's Aid

35:05.711 --> 35:08.679
and she'd have them take my kids
and put them in a home.

35:08.747 --> 35:11.014
Do you know what happens
to kids

35:11.082 --> 35:13.049
in those places?

35:13.116 --> 35:15.117
They get hurt.

35:15.185 --> 35:18.355
And nobody's gonna hurt
my children.

35:18.422 --> 35:20.357
Nobody.

35:20.424 --> 35:22.459
Michelle.

35:25.463 --> 35:30.198
I just read her tell Ling
that he hit the wrong target.

35:30.266 --> 35:32.368
So Dino isn't the target.

35:32.435 --> 35:34.737
The Crown Prosecutor.

35:39.921 --> 35:42.456
Klein, where are we at
with Ellis?

35:42.524 --> 35:44.525
I keep getting her voicemail.
The trial starts any minute.

35:44.593 --> 35:46.559
She's gotta be
around that courthouse.

35:46.627 --> 35:48.495
I'm trying to get a hold
of her assistant right now.

35:48.562 --> 35:51.931
Ok, well, call me
as soon as you get her location.

35:51.999 --> 35:54.000
Come on, let's go.

35:54.067 --> 35:56.002
- Let's go, clear this area.
- Clear it out.

35:56.069 --> 35:58.438
- All clear.
- Is he good? Good?

35:58.506 --> 36:01.107
- Yeah.
- Package is leaving the station. I repeat,

36:01.175 --> 36:03.442
package is leaving the station.
En route to delivery.

36:03.510 --> 36:05.441
- Yeah, we're good.
- All right, clear.

36:05.561 --> 36:06.326
Let's go.

36:06.446 --> 36:09.080
(Siren)

36:09.148 --> 36:11.350
Michelle, the assistant says
that Ellis's phone must be off.

36:11.418 --> 36:13.919
Something about she likes
to focus before a big trial.

36:13.986 --> 36:15.854
Well, she's about
to lose her focus.

36:15.922 --> 36:17.489
Alert the courthouse security.

36:17.557 --> 36:19.457
If they get Ling in their
sights, they're not to engage

36:19.525 --> 36:21.726
unless absolutely necessary.
<I>Copy that.</I>

36:21.794 --> 36:24.295
Ok, call Burrows, tell him
that Ellis is the target,

36:24.363 --> 36:26.096
then have him call my cell.

36:28.834 --> 36:31.436
Eye witness testimony.

36:34.772 --> 36:36.840
Tedeschi.

36:36.907 --> 36:40.444
Copy that. Change of plans. Get Deluca
back in his room and lock him down.

36:40.511 --> 36:43.747
Don't move him till I tell you
otherwise. I'm on the move.

36:46.584 --> 36:49.553
Michelle, Dev just told me that Deluca's
not the target. What's your 20?

36:49.620 --> 36:50.699
We're en route to the courthouse.

36:50.819 --> 36:52.369
Ok, this is what you want
to look for: Ling wants

36:52.489 --> 36:54.957
a four-to-six-storey low-rise
with a rear fire escape

36:55.024 --> 36:57.092
<i>if possible.
He wants the sun behind him.</i>

36:57.160 --> 36:58.914
No, I know the building.
It's all open sky down there.

36:59.034 --> 37:00.009
There's no sniper shot.

37:00.129 --> 37:03.065
He's going to get up close and personal.
<i>He might even try a walk-by</i>

37:03.132 --> 37:05.601
<i>- With a silencer.</i>
- The trial starts in 20 minutes.

37:05.669 --> 37:08.102
Must be why he's biding his
time. He's gonna kill her before

37:08.170 --> 37:10.638
- the trial to make a point.
- I need you down there now.

37:10.706 --> 37:13.375
Look, I'm en route, but he will
not let you take him. Understand?

37:13.442 --> 37:15.877
Well, then I won't give him
a choice.

37:34.362 --> 37:35.796
Toby?

37:35.864 --> 37:38.664
I'm on it.

37:38.732 --> 37:41.166
<i>I can't believe she actually</i>
<i>had the nerves.</i>

37:41.234 --> 37:44.136
<i>- I think he likes me.</i>
<i>- Lawyers.</i>

37:44.204 --> 37:46.806
(Speaking to herself) He's a...

37:46.874 --> 37:50.042
<i>- Going to finish this.</i>
<i>- There.</i>

37:56.382 --> 37:58.550
IIB! Drop your weapon!

37:58.618 --> 38:01.787
(Frightened shouts)

38:01.854 --> 38:04.222
Drop it!

38:07.727 --> 38:10.128
- Hands behind your head.
- Calm down.

38:10.195 --> 38:12.262
You're making a mistake.

38:18.069 --> 38:20.003
Michelle, he's got a knife!

38:20.071 --> 38:23.106
Ah! Ugh! Aw!

38:25.444 --> 38:27.610
Get up.

38:34.017 --> 38:36.719
Burrows. Looks like Christmas
came early for you.

38:36.787 --> 38:39.355
Tai Ling.
So we finally meet.

38:39.423 --> 38:42.124
I get it. You're not
real talkative?

38:42.192 --> 38:45.727
We'll get caught up in DC.

38:45.795 --> 38:48.564
So, how does it feel?

38:48.631 --> 38:52.300
It's been a long chase, McCluskey.
I can't believe it's actually over.

38:52.368 --> 38:55.038
Well, I'm sure you'll find something
else to fill the emptiness inside.

38:55.158 --> 38:57.671
That dry Canadian wit.
I'm gonna miss that.

38:57.791 --> 39:00.641
But hey, it takes time
for extradition papers,

39:00.709 --> 39:03.310
so I'm free tonight. Drinks?

39:03.378 --> 39:05.312
I'll let you know.

39:10.552 --> 39:13.754
What do you say, face reader?
I got a chance with her?

39:13.822 --> 39:17.958
Nice working with you,
Agent Burrows.

39:26.901 --> 39:29.736
What's going on?
No one's answering my calls.

39:32.438 --> 39:35.541
- The trial's been suspended.
- What?

39:35.609 --> 39:40.980
Pending the IIB investigation into the
alleged misconduct of the prosecutor.

39:46.952 --> 39:51.656
So... Tedeschi walks free,
and I'm being investigated?

39:51.724 --> 39:54.592
Save it, Krista.
It's over.

39:54.660 --> 39:56.794
Oh, no, it's only just begun.

39:56.862 --> 39:58.763
You think I'm going to lay down
and take this?

39:58.831 --> 40:00.832
I'm going to fight you
every step of the way.

40:00.900 --> 40:04.368
You've already lost.
We know what you've done.

40:04.436 --> 40:07.238
You are aware that you were
the target all along?

40:07.305 --> 40:09.773
That your obsession
very nearly got you killed?

40:09.841 --> 40:14.078
I only did what I had to do to take
a dangerous man off the street.

40:14.146 --> 40:16.880
And advance your career.

40:16.948 --> 40:18.982
Actually, I was trying
to make a difference.

40:20.951 --> 40:22.885
But you crossed the line.

40:22.953 --> 40:27.924
I didn't take you
for the idealistic type, Alvin.

40:32.796 --> 40:35.830
I'll spare you the cuffs.

40:37.767 --> 40:39.535
(Door opening)

40:39.602 --> 40:41.570
Can you escort her
from the building, please?

40:41.637 --> 40:43.072
(Man): Yes, sir.

40:43.139 --> 40:44.673
Ma'am?

41:05.227 --> 41:07.160
We know you killed Valentine.

41:07.228 --> 41:09.796
You don't know anything.
You'll never prove it.

41:09.863 --> 41:12.865
Maybe. But we can prove that you gave
Maria the hookup to Ling, which makes you

41:12.933 --> 41:15.569
an accessory
to attempted homicide.

41:15.636 --> 41:19.539
- I gotta talk to my lawyer.
- Yeah, I bet you do.

41:19.607 --> 41:24.009
â™ª All her friends tell me
she's got a halo â™ª

41:24.077 --> 41:25.644
So, how was your day?

41:25.712 --> 41:29.348
My day was...
long story. Boring.

41:29.416 --> 41:32.384
I don't need the little details.
Give me the... give me the takeaway.

41:32.452 --> 41:34.420
- Takeaway?
- Mm-hmm.

41:34.488 --> 41:36.822
Well, the takeaway, let's see.
Don't be blinded

41:36.889 --> 41:39.924
by your obsessions.
Don't push too hard.

41:39.992 --> 41:42.494
Learn to let go.
Wait, so it's about knowing

41:42.561 --> 41:45.863
when to let go
and not get too close.

41:45.931 --> 41:48.298
Hey, I saw what you did there.
You made it about us.

41:48.366 --> 41:51.602
- Thought I was being subtle.
- Uh-huh.

41:51.670 --> 41:55.640
â™ª Had to check my heart
out her front door â™ª

41:55.707 --> 41:57.174
Wait.

41:57.242 --> 41:59.209
- Wait.
- What?

41:59.277 --> 42:03.446
If we fall into bed again,
that means that I will be

42:03.514 --> 42:06.116
- sleeping over again.
- Uhhuh.

42:06.183 --> 42:07.699
What will your friend think?

42:07.819 --> 42:10.300
Well, I think I don't care
what my friend thinks.

42:10.420 --> 42:14.290
I think that you and I could
beat the odds.

42:14.358 --> 42:15.892
I think that this thing...

42:15.960 --> 42:18.028
- Wait, this thing?
- Yeah. We can go all the way.

42:18.095 --> 42:20.428
All the way.
That was almost romantic.

42:20.496 --> 42:23.096
Yeah.
