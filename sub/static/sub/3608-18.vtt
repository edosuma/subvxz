WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:07.757
- Isn't this nice?
- I kind of prefer breathing.

00:07.841 --> 00:12.303
Come on, you're doing great.
You know, exercise is addictive.

00:12.388 --> 00:14.847
Wow. I can...

00:16.558 --> 00:18.601
I can see why.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.484
Guess I need to drop a few pounds.

00:26.568 --> 00:30.196
Don't be so hard on yourself.
It's not gonna happen overnight.

00:30.280 --> 00:33.783
Some people's metabolisms
are just a little slower.

00:35.285 --> 00:37.370
It's not my metabolism.

00:41.458 --> 00:43.459
I'm sick.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.461
What?

00:47.172 --> 00:49.173
What's wrong?

00:51.593 --> 00:53.553
Never mind.

00:53.637 --> 00:55.263
Hurley...

00:56.557 --> 00:58.683
You can trust me.

01:02.312 --> 01:03.521
OK.

01:06.275 --> 01:08.443
But it's bad.

01:17.995 --> 01:19.704
When we first crashed here,

01:19.788 --> 01:24.000
I thought, "this isn't all bad.
It's like the all-mango diet."

01:24.084 --> 01:28.546
I wasn't turning any heads or nothing,
but I did drop a couple of belt sizes.

01:29.631 --> 01:34.093
Then we found this hatch,
and it was full of food.

01:34.178 --> 01:36.095
Tons of food.

01:36.847 --> 01:39.098
I tried giving it all away but...

01:40.726 --> 01:44.312
I guess I kinda kept some of it
for myself.

01:48.025 --> 01:50.610
I wish I could just get rid of it.

01:50.694 --> 01:52.695
Then get rid of it.

02:01.872 --> 02:03.873
You wanna change?

02:05.626 --> 02:07.543
Then change.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.827
How do you feel?

02:42.162 --> 02:43.788
I feel free.

03:03.934 --> 03:06.936
They found something. Come on!

03:07.020 --> 03:09.021
Hurry, guys.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.997
Risotto. Nice.

03:27.082 --> 03:28.291
No.

03:29.293 --> 03:31.294
Where did this come from?

03:32.754 --> 03:35.089
Locke said doors trapped him
in the hatch.

03:35.173 --> 03:39.218
Maybe it was because of this,
so no one would see who dropped it.

03:39.303 --> 03:41.220
Any of you guys see a plane last night?

03:41.305 --> 03:45.057
Yeah, I saw it, Tattoo.
I just decided not to tell.

03:45.142 --> 03:47.602
- Hey, give that back, man.
- No, I saw it first.

03:47.686 --> 03:49.562
- You saw me put those in my box.
- No.

03:49.646 --> 03:52.064
- Gimme my stuff!
- Hold on, take it easy!

03:52.149 --> 03:54.483
You're like locusts.
How about a little order?

03:54.568 --> 03:57.028
Shouldn't we
let someone trustworthy do this?

03:57.112 --> 03:58.696
Like you, babynapper?

03:58.780 --> 04:02.909
No. Like Hurley. Why not Hurley? He's
done it before, he could do it again.

04:02.993 --> 04:04.744
No! No way!

04:06.330 --> 04:09.415
- Not me! No! Not again! No.
- OK, hey, hey, guys, guys.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.417
How about no one's in charge, OK?

04:11.501 --> 04:14.587
I'm sure everyone can manage
to just take what they need.

04:14.671 --> 04:18.423
Great plan, Moonbeam. After that,
we can sing Kumbaya and do trust falls.

04:18.507 --> 04:21.761
- ...two of them and put them there.
- ...pull this over here.

04:21.845 --> 04:23.930
- I'll trade you.
- ...savages about it.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.681
We can do it any way you want.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.935
- Bacon?
- Hey, get your hands off those cookies.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.325
Out of my way.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.187
Hey!

05:16.984 --> 05:19.110
Hey! Hey!

06:09.786 --> 06:10.995
Hey.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.291
What you doing?

06:17.461 --> 06:18.836
Nothing.

06:19.963 --> 06:22.256
Who were you looking for up there?

06:26.303 --> 06:27.386
No one.

06:27.471 --> 06:31.140
When you ran off, it sort of seemed
like you were looking for someone.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.976
- I tried to find you...
- I kinda...

06:35.270 --> 06:37.897
don't wanna talk about it.

06:37.981 --> 06:39.857
Sure. OK.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.945
Pretty weird, huh?

06:46.531 --> 06:48.866
You said the island
won't let you lose weight,

06:48.950 --> 06:51.160
you destroy your stash, then bang...

06:51.953 --> 06:53.913
More food falls from the sky.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.958
How about that?

06:59.002 --> 07:00.461
I'm proud of you.

07:02.881 --> 07:06.842
- Proud of me for what?
- Not freaking out.

07:13.016 --> 07:15.017
How's the diet coming, Hugo?

07:19.606 --> 07:21.148
It's OK.

07:22.359 --> 07:25.361
I had a salad and some chicken breast
for lunch.

07:25.445 --> 07:28.906
That's great. It gets easier. I promise.

07:29.991 --> 07:32.618
So,
I heard you had a visit with your mom.

07:32.702 --> 07:35.204
How did that go?

07:35.288 --> 07:37.873
- It was good.
- You're not still mad at her, then?

07:37.958 --> 07:39.458
Nah.

07:39.543 --> 07:42.086
I know she put me in here for a reason.

07:42.170 --> 07:44.171
What reason was that?

07:47.551 --> 07:49.552
The accident.

07:50.720 --> 07:55.266
- You wanna talk about that today?
- Do we have to?

07:55.350 --> 07:57.977
Hugo, you've been in here
almost two months now.

07:58.061 --> 08:01.480
Don't you think it's time
to start getting our hands dirty?

08:04.234 --> 08:09.238
OK, why don't we talk about the little
homework assignment that I gave you?

08:10.615 --> 08:12.616
I was never really good at homework.

08:12.701 --> 08:14.743
Remember what
you were supposed to do?

08:14.828 --> 08:18.330
Just make a list of things
that you like about yourself?

08:18.415 --> 08:22.251
- Nobody else did it.
- Nobody else? Meaning?

08:22.335 --> 08:26.505
Well, Dave didn't do it.
He said it was a stupid idea.

08:26.590 --> 08:28.966
Well, you know, I'm not Dave's doctor,

08:29.050 --> 08:33.929
but we have talked about
how he can be a very negative influence.

08:34.931 --> 08:37.765
Dave's the most normal person
in this place, man.

08:37.851 --> 08:41.312
But he doesn't want you to change,
does he?

08:44.357 --> 08:47.860
Come on, give me the ball.
Give me the ball! I can play defense.

08:47.944 --> 08:51.530
Dude! Dude, I'm open! Dude! Dude!

08:51.615 --> 08:55.201
It's called "dribbling," not "drooling!"
"Dribbling!"

08:55.285 --> 08:57.912
Well, shoot it, then! Shoot it! What?

08:57.996 --> 09:01.123
High percentage shot. Excellent choice.

09:02.167 --> 09:03.792
- Shoot it!
- Want in the game?

09:03.877 --> 09:06.795
Go for it.
Something tells me no one'll care.

09:08.965 --> 09:11.467
What's the matter with you?

09:11.551 --> 09:13.219
Nothing.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.973
Dude! Dude, give up the rock!

09:19.142 --> 09:23.145
Fantastic. Give it to the guy
who's not even in the game!

09:25.273 --> 09:28.901
Hey, it's Taco Night, dude.
Let's blow this pop stand.

09:29.986 --> 09:34.907
- What?
- Brooks said you're, like, negative.

09:34.991 --> 09:39.078
Well, duh! So, what, you don't
wanna hang out with me any more?

09:39.162 --> 09:42.748
- No, I don't know, it's...
- That quack getting inside your head?

09:42.832 --> 09:46.335
Do not let him. You got much more
important things to think about.

09:46.419 --> 09:50.464
- Like what?
- Like, hard or soft shell, baby?

09:50.548 --> 09:54.301
Chicken or shrimp?
Sour cream or hot sauce?

09:56.137 --> 09:58.847
- Yeah, I guess I could eat.
- Yeah, I thought so.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.350
Noche de Tacos, amigo.

10:09.192 --> 10:11.318
Good. Now, can you do the other one?

10:17.826 --> 10:19.868
- Is it broken?
- Without an X-ray,

10:19.953 --> 10:21.996
you'll have to do with my best guess.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.332
Sorry.

10:28.545 --> 10:32.172
- How you holding up?
- Depends on Jack's best guess.

10:32.257 --> 10:36.051
There's a small fracture,
probably hairline.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.721
This will reduce the swelling
until I get a splint.

10:38.805 --> 10:43.058
- How long until I can walk on it?
- Keep off it a couple of weeks.

10:43.143 --> 10:47.438
- There's a wheelchair back at camp...
- No. I don't need a wheelchair.

10:47.522 --> 10:52.443
We took a pair of crutches from the
fuselage when we moved down the beach.

10:53.069 --> 10:54.361
OK.

10:55.071 --> 10:57.031
I'll be back in a while.

10:59.868 --> 11:01.994
He could've escaped.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.121
- Sorry?
- Henry.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.667
During the lockdown. I was hurt.

11:08.752 --> 11:11.587
He could have escaped...

11:11.671 --> 11:15.007
but he came back to help me.
Why would he do that?

11:15.091 --> 11:17.468
He didn't come back to help you, John.

11:17.552 --> 11:22.264
He came back because he thought
his story was gonna check out.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.479
He was dead already.

11:30.690 --> 11:34.693
Four months ago,
I was part of the search party.

11:34.778 --> 11:39.531
Henry Gale was hanging
out of the basket, neck broken.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.993
So he was already dead?

11:44.287 --> 11:45.621
Yes.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.374
And then you buried him
and left the grave marker?

11:48.458 --> 11:50.000
Yes.

11:50.710 --> 11:54.421
You really should have checked
his wallet before you did that.

11:57.175 --> 12:01.553
I assume Henry Gale did not have any
paper on which to compose his thoughts,

12:01.638 --> 12:03.680
so he had to improvise.

12:03.765 --> 12:05.891
There wasn't much space for that.

12:08.144 --> 12:09.520
"Jennifer..."

12:10.438 --> 12:16.402
"Well, you were right. Crossing the
Pacific isn't easy. I owe you a beer."

12:16.486 --> 12:20.406
"I'm hiking to one of the beaches
to start a signal fire,

12:20.490 --> 12:24.451
but if you're reading this,
I guess I didn't make it."

12:24.536 --> 12:29.998
"I'm sorry. I love you, Jenny.
Always have, always will."

12:31.835 --> 12:34.503
"Yours, Henry."

12:36.840 --> 12:39.258
So tell me...

12:39.342 --> 12:43.512
how did Henry Gale write a note
to his wife with a broken neck?

12:47.183 --> 12:51.562
It wasn't me. I didn't kill him.
You don't understand...

12:51.646 --> 12:54.773
How did you know his wife's name?
Did you interrogate him?

12:54.858 --> 12:59.486
- Please... just listen... I'm just a...
- How many of you are there?

12:59.571 --> 13:03.240
If I tell you about them,
you have no idea what he'll do.

13:03.324 --> 13:04.741
He?

13:04.826 --> 13:08.287
You mean their leader.
The guy with the beard.

13:08.371 --> 13:12.958
- Him? He's no one. Nothing!
- Where are your people?

13:13.042 --> 13:15.419
- I can't...
- How many of you are there?

13:15.503 --> 13:18.255
- You don't understand!
- Understand this!

13:18.339 --> 13:19.923
Hey.

13:20.008 --> 13:24.553
You have three seconds to answer my
question. How many of you are there?

13:24.637 --> 13:25.721
- One.
- He'll kill me!

13:25.805 --> 13:27.973
I'll kill you.

13:28.057 --> 13:29.224
- Two.
- Sayid!

13:29.309 --> 13:32.227
You can't do this!
I am not a bad person!

13:32.312 --> 13:33.437
Three.

13:35.023 --> 13:37.816
What the hell's wrong with you?

13:37.901 --> 13:40.486
- What's going on? I heard a shot!
- What happened?

13:40.570 --> 13:44.490
- He's a liar.
- It's fine. Just get him out of here.

13:44.574 --> 13:45.866
Jack!

13:48.578 --> 13:49.912
Jack?

13:53.541 --> 13:55.918
- Jack!
- I've got it covered, John.

14:00.798 --> 14:03.467
- Thank you.
- Shut up.

14:18.149 --> 14:20.192
Hey.

14:20.276 --> 14:22.444
I noticed you were building something.

14:22.529 --> 14:27.282
I thought maybe you could use this,
for whatever it is.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.952
That's very thoughtful of you, Charlie.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.751
Why don't you help me?

14:38.836 --> 14:40.796
What are you making?

14:42.131 --> 14:44.007
Hold that end.

14:47.971 --> 14:50.013
Is it a Starbucks?

14:54.143 --> 14:56.728
Help me carry one of those logs, please.

14:56.813 --> 14:58.480
Are you gonna tell me?

15:01.693 --> 15:03.485
Not right now.

15:58.166 --> 16:00.250
You're not here!

16:18.561 --> 16:20.145
Hey!

16:20.229 --> 16:24.107
Wait!

16:24.192 --> 16:26.234
Wait! Dave!

16:42.585 --> 16:44.419
You OK, Hurley?

16:47.590 --> 16:50.509
Did either of you see
a guy run through here?

16:50.593 --> 16:52.594
In a bathrobe?

16:54.597 --> 16:56.682
With a coconut?

16:57.392 --> 17:01.269
No. I saw a polar bear
on rollerblades with a mango.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.398
I did not see anything, Hurley.

17:06.608 --> 17:09.152
Yeah, me neither.

17:13.991 --> 17:17.786
- 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42...
- Aw, dude.

17:18.663 --> 17:20.955
Pretty sneaky, Leonard.

17:23.209 --> 17:27.087
Using those magic numbers of yours
as a pysch-out, aren't you, man?

17:28.464 --> 17:32.217
Oh, yeah, that's right. You just
play dumb. I'm onto your juju, man.

17:32.301 --> 17:36.722
- They're just numbers, dude.
- What the hell is that?

17:37.557 --> 17:39.391
It's my mid-afternoon snack.

17:39.475 --> 17:42.686
Dude, that's celery.
Celery is not a snack.

17:44.063 --> 17:48.817
Leonard's got graham crackers.
You should snag one. He won't notice.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.486
What's he gonna do? Call you a "23"?

17:52.488 --> 17:57.659
- 4, 8, 15, 16...
- 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. Hike!

17:59.996 --> 18:02.539
Hey, Hugo. Here's your meds.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.417
Thank you, Nurse Lazenby.

18:06.419 --> 18:09.045
Dude, you wanna get outta here with me?

18:09.130 --> 18:13.717
- Don't take the horse tranquilizer.
- What do you mean, "get outta here?"

18:13.801 --> 18:17.179
I mean, escape, man. Me and you. ASAP.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.848
They're getting to you, dude.
We gotta split.

18:19.932 --> 18:23.560
- Dr. Brooks says...
- Dr. Brooks does not care about you.

18:23.644 --> 18:25.771
He's the one prescribing that crap.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.733
What the hell is it anyway?

18:30.777 --> 18:33.987
- Clonazepam.
- Hugo.

18:34.071 --> 18:38.116
- Something wrong with your meds, there?
- No.

18:38.201 --> 18:42.913
Me and Dave were just, you know...
talking about stuff.

18:42.997 --> 18:45.665
Right. Well, sorry to interrupt.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.585
Hello there, Dave.

18:48.669 --> 18:50.378
Hello there, Dr. Brooks.

18:50.463 --> 18:53.465
- And how are you today?
- Never been saner.

18:53.549 --> 18:58.220
I'm taking pictures for the bulletin
board. I've got everyone except you two.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.722
- Would you guys mind?
- OK.

19:02.975 --> 19:06.937
OK. Why don't you
get a little closer together?

19:07.021 --> 19:10.482
Are you gonna make us
look at the ducky, too?

19:10.566 --> 19:11.900
Say cheese!

19:11.984 --> 19:13.985
- Cheese!
- Queso!

19:15.488 --> 19:19.157
Great. OK, you...
you need a little water with that?

19:19.242 --> 19:21.326
Nope. I'm good.

19:21.410 --> 19:24.120
OK. Well, fine. See you later, guys.

19:24.205 --> 19:26.206
Thanks for the photo op.

19:27.416 --> 19:31.169
8, 15, 16, 23, 42...

19:31.254 --> 19:34.256
- Dude...
- Dude.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.758
The revolution has begun, man.

19:36.843 --> 19:40.095
Lay low. When the time is right, we fly.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.775
You gotta twist it.

19:55.611 --> 19:58.613
To get the frosting.
Pulling it'll only break your cookie.

19:58.698 --> 20:03.034
Well, that's what I get for not going
to the expert in the first place.

20:03.119 --> 20:05.078
What can I do you for, Deep Dish?

20:06.873 --> 20:09.374
I was kind of looking for something.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.042
Forget it. I'm done trading.

20:11.127 --> 20:14.129
I got enough food now
to open a chain of mini-marts.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.047
Hey, you think Sayid needs a job?

20:16.132 --> 20:19.885
Well, actually, I was sort of
hoping you'd do me a favor.

20:19.969 --> 20:22.804
Remember when I helped you out
with that tree frog...

20:22.889 --> 20:25.140
which you killed?

20:25.224 --> 20:27.434
Yeah, I remember.

20:27.518 --> 20:31.021
Well, I sorta... need some medicine.

20:32.315 --> 20:34.149
What do you need?

20:34.233 --> 20:38.278
- It's called Clonazepam.
- Clonaze-what?

20:38.362 --> 20:40.530
What the hell's that?

20:40.615 --> 20:45.160
It's so you can calm down
or for when you're seeing things...

20:46.662 --> 20:49.706
that aren't supposed to be there.

20:52.126 --> 20:54.336
What stuff are you seeing?

20:56.505 --> 20:59.799
I don't know, maybe, like,
a bald guy in a bathrobe.

21:01.719 --> 21:03.720
You mean like that guy there?

21:07.808 --> 21:08.975
Gotcha.

21:12.730 --> 21:16.107
- Think you're funny?
- What are you doing? Get off me!

21:16.192 --> 21:18.735
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- Get off me!

21:18.819 --> 21:20.779
- Let go of me!
- Lambchop!

21:24.533 --> 21:29.371
Pork Pie! Babar! Jabba! Stay-Puft!

21:32.375 --> 21:35.377
- Kong! Deep Dish!
- Let go of me! Get him off me!

21:35.461 --> 21:40.674
Get off me! You out of your mind?
What the hell's the matter with you?

21:40.758 --> 21:42.217
Get off me!

21:47.223 --> 21:49.224
What the hell's the matter with you?

21:50.977 --> 21:54.604
- You're crazy!
- I'm not crazy.

21:58.734 --> 22:00.735
I'm not crazy.

22:03.572 --> 22:05.824
So, he just attacked you, huh?

22:09.078 --> 22:11.413
Try to contain yourself, Freckles.

22:11.497 --> 22:13.248
What? I'm worried.

22:13.332 --> 22:17.460
- You look like you got your ass kicked.
- Don't you got an adventure to get to?

22:17.545 --> 22:20.255
I think Timmy fell down a well
over that way.

22:23.342 --> 22:27.512
- Why would Hurley of all people...
- I got no idea! I didn't do nothing.

22:27.596 --> 22:30.515
- He just Hulked out on me.
- For no reason at all?

22:30.599 --> 22:32.684
OK.

22:32.768 --> 22:35.687
You walk off
and have yourself a nice long giggle.

22:35.771 --> 22:38.982
But steer clear. The man is crazy.

22:47.116 --> 22:48.575
Hurley?

22:50.995 --> 22:52.996
Hey.

22:53.080 --> 22:57.542
- You OK? What happened with Sawyer?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

22:57.626 --> 23:02.630
- So, you beat him up?
- Guess you know what happened, then.

23:02.715 --> 23:07.677
- I'm on your side. Whatever you...
- Look, I don't wanna talk, OK?

23:14.310 --> 23:16.561
- What?
- That's a lot of peanut butter.

23:16.645 --> 23:18.772
I'll need a lot of protein
where I'm going.

23:18.856 --> 23:21.316
- Where are you going?
- Back to the caves.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.027
No one lives there,
so I won't bother anybody.

23:24.111 --> 23:26.362
I'm gonna live alone
and be one of those guys.

23:26.447 --> 23:29.949
You know, the crazy guys, with a big
beard, no clothes, who's naked

23:30.034 --> 23:33.411
- and throws doody at people.
- Hurley, you don't have to do this.

23:33.496 --> 23:35.205
Just leave me alone.

23:35.289 --> 23:39.042
You can't help me. No one can.

24:32.680 --> 24:34.180
You're not here.

24:40.020 --> 24:42.021
You were in the hospital.

24:43.732 --> 24:48.194
- You can't be here.
- Sorry, dude. I am here.

24:52.408 --> 24:55.994
I like that I have a good relationship
with my mom.

24:56.078 --> 24:59.080
I like making my Grandpa Tito laugh.

25:00.541 --> 25:02.417
I like chicken.

25:04.044 --> 25:06.921
No, that last one wasn't about you,
Hugo.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.883
I like that I like chicken?

25:12.553 --> 25:15.305
So tell me,
how did it feel writing that?

25:15.389 --> 25:17.515
Was that difficult?

25:17.600 --> 25:19.851
Kinda.
I think I messed up some spelling.

25:19.935 --> 25:22.645
You didn't say anything
about the way you look.

25:22.730 --> 25:25.440
Are you comfortable
with your appearance?

25:27.443 --> 25:29.110
Well, it's not like...

25:31.071 --> 25:33.823
I mean, I can't really
do anything about it, right?

25:44.210 --> 25:45.793
If I...

25:48.505 --> 25:52.717
If I... wasn't so fat...

25:57.890 --> 26:00.433
they never would have died.

26:06.482 --> 26:11.527
There were 23 people on that deck.
It was built to hold eight.

26:11.612 --> 26:14.948
And it would have collapsed
whether you went out there or not.

26:15.032 --> 26:17.283
Yeah, but I did walk out there.

26:18.786 --> 26:20.662
And it did collapse.

26:23.707 --> 26:25.833
- And I killed them.
- It was an accident.

26:25.918 --> 26:27.710
It was my fault.

26:28.671 --> 26:34.550
Look, after those people died, you were
in a practically catatonic state.

26:34.635 --> 26:39.055
You stopped talking, you stopped
going out, you stopped sleeping.

26:41.684 --> 26:47.272
But you never stopped eating,
because that's how you punish yourself.

26:51.360 --> 26:53.361
Dave's right about you.

26:54.530 --> 26:56.864
You're nothing but a quack.

26:58.200 --> 27:03.329
- Dave doesn't want you to lose weight.
- You know, Dave cares about me.

27:03.414 --> 27:05.415
He's my friend.

27:08.794 --> 27:12.505
I'm gonna show you something,
and it may upset you.

27:13.048 --> 27:17.719
This is the photo
that I took for the bulletin board.

27:25.561 --> 27:28.187
Dave isn't your friend, Hugo...

27:30.065 --> 27:32.650
because Dave doesn't exist.

27:50.586 --> 27:52.837
Hey! Wake up, dude.

27:57.426 --> 28:00.636
Finally. You could sleep
through a damn NASCAR race, man.

28:00.721 --> 28:03.264
But, you're not... You're...

28:03.932 --> 28:05.558
You're a hallucination.

28:07.770 --> 28:09.937
Was that a hallucination?

28:10.022 --> 28:12.106
Maybe I just imagined you slapped me.

28:12.191 --> 28:15.234
- Damn it!
- We can do this all night.

28:15.319 --> 28:17.904
Dr. Brooks showed me
a picture from the rec room,

28:17.988 --> 28:19.906
and my arm was around nothingness.

28:20.741 --> 28:23.368
Kinko's? Photoshop?

28:23.452 --> 28:25.620
Think they really
blew up the Death Star?

28:25.704 --> 28:27.872
- No.
- Then stop talking crazy, man.

28:27.956 --> 28:30.124
Come on, we're on a clock here.

28:34.296 --> 28:36.089
Hey, you in or you out, dude?

28:42.429 --> 28:44.430
OK, come on, come on.

28:46.975 --> 28:49.936
Yo, check it out,
Marcus didn't finish his lasagna.

28:50.020 --> 28:52.563
That is a waste, man. One for the road?

29:04.284 --> 29:06.828
Wait for it. Wait.

29:16.171 --> 29:19.006
Tippytoes, big guy. Vámonos!

29:34.022 --> 29:38.609
OK, man, you got the keys, hombre.
You took 'em off Brooks' desk earlier.

29:42.990 --> 29:45.116
Come on, man, open it, open it.

29:57.713 --> 29:59.839
Can you taste that?

30:00.466 --> 30:02.300
That is freedom, baby.

30:04.261 --> 30:08.639
Know what tastes even better
than freedom? Cheeseburgers.

30:21.778 --> 30:24.739
Come on, man! Chili fries on me.

30:26.575 --> 30:28.326
I don't think I can do this.

30:31.163 --> 30:35.291
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry? What, are you kidding me?

30:35.375 --> 30:38.252
You're not real.
You're trying to get me to run away

30:38.337 --> 30:40.171
and get cheeseburgers because...

30:40.255 --> 30:42.924
I want cheeseburgers.

30:43.008 --> 30:47.637
- Did you take those pills, man?
- No, man, I'm just not coming.

30:47.721 --> 30:52.475
- Look, you don't want me to change.
- You don't need to change, man.

30:52.559 --> 30:55.811
- You are fine. You are great.
- No, I'm not.

30:57.940 --> 31:01.526
You just want me to stay fat.
You don't want me to get better.

31:01.610 --> 31:04.195
You wouldn't care
if I ate myself to death.

31:04.279 --> 31:06.364
Do not do this, man.

31:06.448 --> 31:12.370
If you don't come with me right now,
you will never get outta here.

31:16.959 --> 31:18.751
Bye, Dave.

31:39.815 --> 31:42.984
You wouldn't happen to have my slipper,
would you?

31:52.744 --> 31:54.328
Thank you.

31:56.331 --> 31:59.750
Oh, man! You got peanut butter on it.

32:02.713 --> 32:08.009
OK, look, I know you're freaking out
right now, and I'm sorry, but...

32:09.845 --> 32:12.847
it's gonna get a little worse
before it gets better.

32:12.931 --> 32:17.101
- Worse?
- Yeah. Kinda.

32:17.185 --> 32:19.145
You ready, dude?

32:22.858 --> 32:26.944
You remember that night
you closed that window on me?

32:27.029 --> 32:29.280
Remember what you did
after that night?

32:29.364 --> 32:30.865
Yeah.

32:31.825 --> 32:34.035
I realized you were imaginary.

32:35.537 --> 32:39.332
And... that was a breakthrough.

32:41.126 --> 32:43.544
And a little while later,
Brooks let me out,

32:43.629 --> 32:46.255
and I went home to live with my mom,

32:46.340 --> 32:48.758
and I got my job at Mr. Cluck's back,

32:48.842 --> 32:51.761
- and I got better.
- OK. Good. Great. Yeah.

32:51.845 --> 32:54.347
Except, see, here's the thing.

32:57.643 --> 32:59.477
None of that ever happened.

33:01.396 --> 33:05.441
- What?
- You're still at Santa Rosa, man.

33:05.525 --> 33:08.069
You never left the hospital.

33:13.909 --> 33:18.663
- That's not possible.
- It's hard, I know.

33:18.747 --> 33:21.999
But, I mean, all this?

33:22.084 --> 33:26.087
You? Me? This island?
That peanut butter?

33:26.171 --> 33:28.005
None of it's real, man.

33:28.090 --> 33:30.174
None of it's happening.

33:30.258 --> 33:33.177
It's all in your head, my friend.

33:33.261 --> 33:36.722
The second you closed that window,
your brain popped a gasket.

33:36.807 --> 33:38.766
You went back into your coma thing,

33:38.850 --> 33:41.769
and that's where you are
right this very second.

33:41.853 --> 33:45.940
In your own private Idaho
inside Santa Rosa.

33:46.775 --> 33:48.401
No.

33:48.485 --> 33:49.777
I had...

33:49.861 --> 33:51.320
My mom...

33:51.405 --> 33:53.531
My friend Johnny...

33:53.615 --> 33:57.034
- I won the lottery.
- Whoa! Wow!

33:57.119 --> 33:59.537
Awesome, dude.

33:59.621 --> 34:01.414
What numbers did you play?

34:04.626 --> 34:08.254
Leonard's numbers, right?
From the hospital? What a coincidence.

34:08.338 --> 34:10.547
You seen them around anywhere else?

34:12.717 --> 34:15.553
- The hatch.
- Bingo! The hatch.

34:15.637 --> 34:20.391
With the button that you gotta push
every 108 minutes or the world ends.

34:20.475 --> 34:23.768
Oh, oh, oh,
and what's the code for the button?

34:23.853 --> 34:27.313
Oh, yeah. The numbers.

34:30.569 --> 34:32.652
But I got better.

34:32.737 --> 34:35.572
- I changed.
- Changed? Are you kidding?

34:35.657 --> 34:38.743
You've been on a deserted island
for over two months

34:38.827 --> 34:40.828
and you haven't dropped ten pounds.

34:40.911 --> 34:42.913
How is that even possible, man?

34:42.998 --> 34:45.791
I just destroyed my stash.
And I've been exercising.

34:45.876 --> 34:48.085
- Libby says it won't...
- Right, Libby.

34:48.170 --> 34:49.670
The mega-cute blonde chick

34:49.755 --> 34:52.797
who magically appeared
from the other side of the island.

34:52.882 --> 34:57.052
Oh, yeah, and who just happens
to have the hots for you?

35:01.016 --> 35:03.225
Come on, man. Let's take a walk.

35:07.814 --> 35:11.567
- So this is all in my brain?
- Every rock. Every tree.

35:11.651 --> 35:16.614
Every tree frog. Even me. The real me,
the one they told you was imaginary?

35:16.698 --> 35:18.491
He went out that window, man.

35:18.575 --> 35:21.911
Right now, he's probably bouncing
from hot chick to hot chick.

35:21.995 --> 35:24.747
Unlike me, who's really you,

35:24.831 --> 35:26.874
who's got more important things to do.

35:28.168 --> 35:31.128
- So I'm making you up?
- Well, sorta.

35:31.213 --> 35:33.714
I'm part of your subconscious, man.

35:33.799 --> 35:36.342
All the people on this island are.

35:37.385 --> 35:39.512
What part of me are you?

35:40.555 --> 35:43.724
I'm the part of you
that wants to wake up, man.

35:45.477 --> 35:47.186
Follow me.

35:53.568 --> 35:55.569
This is it, dude.

35:56.947 --> 35:59.490
- It?
- The big finale.

36:00.242 --> 36:02.326
The answer to all your problems.

36:03.411 --> 36:05.871
A way for you to wake up,
snap out of it.

36:11.419 --> 36:13.003
I don't wanna kill myself.

36:13.088 --> 36:15.673
Who said anything
about killing yourself, man?

36:15.757 --> 36:17.967
This is gonna bring you back to life.

36:21.596 --> 36:23.430
The only way for you to bust out

36:23.515 --> 36:28.018
is to tell your mind
that you don't believe any of this.

36:29.437 --> 36:31.021
So...

36:31.773 --> 36:33.691
if I...

36:35.944 --> 36:39.780
All this will be gone?
I'll just wake up?

36:39.865 --> 36:41.365
That's right.

36:43.118 --> 36:46.537
And when you do wake up, come find me.

36:47.497 --> 36:49.665
I'm sure I miss you.

36:52.252 --> 36:54.295
See you in another life, Hurley.

36:55.964 --> 36:57.590
Dave!

37:16.359 --> 37:18.402
Jack not back yet?

37:18.486 --> 37:23.032
Nope. He's telling everyone at the beach
that we've got one of 'em.

37:23.116 --> 37:26.994
Something tells me people have
a lot of questions about our houseguest.

37:27.078 --> 37:28.537
I want to talk to him.

37:28.622 --> 37:31.582
I don't think that's on today's program.

37:31.666 --> 37:35.377
Well, all due respect, Ana Lucia,
but I don't care what you think.

37:38.006 --> 37:39.965
Five minutes.

37:41.760 --> 37:44.386
I earned five minutes with him.

38:04.199 --> 38:06.241
What's your name?

38:07.953 --> 38:09.453
Your real name.

38:09.537 --> 38:13.207
Why don't you
just keep calling me Henry?

38:15.877 --> 38:17.962
I've gotten used to it.

38:21.716 --> 38:24.051
Did you get caught on purpose?

38:25.387 --> 38:28.764
You and your people have been here
for God knows how long,

38:28.848 --> 38:32.434
- and you got caught in a net...
- God doesn't know.

38:32.519 --> 38:34.353
Excuse me?

38:37.107 --> 38:40.401
God doesn't know
how long we've been here, John.

38:41.403 --> 38:46.323
He can't see this island any better
than the rest of the world can.

38:46.408 --> 38:48.450
May I ask you a question?

38:50.662 --> 38:56.000
What possible reason could I have
for putting myself through all this?

38:56.084 --> 39:00.004
Maybe your people
were looking for this place.

39:00.088 --> 39:01.714
This place?

39:03.591 --> 39:07.261
This place is a joke, John.

39:08.430 --> 39:11.015
What are you talking about?

39:11.099 --> 39:12.975
I crawled through your vents

39:13.059 --> 39:17.521
and I stood at your computer
as the alarm beeped.

39:17.605 --> 39:19.523
And you know what happened?

39:21.192 --> 39:23.944
The timer went all the way down to zero.

39:25.363 --> 39:29.158
And then some funny red pictures
flipped up in its place.

39:29.242 --> 39:33.662
They looked like hieroglyphics,
but I'm no expert.

39:34.497 --> 39:36.415
Then things got real interesting.

39:36.499 --> 39:40.044
There was a loud... clunking

39:40.128 --> 39:45.174
and a hum like a... magnet,
a big magnet.

39:45.258 --> 39:47.509
It was really very frightening.

39:49.971 --> 39:52.139
And do you know what happened next?

39:54.309 --> 39:56.643
Nothing happened, John.

39:58.313 --> 40:00.189
Nothing happened at all.

40:00.273 --> 40:04.068
Your timer just flipped back to 108.

40:08.239 --> 40:10.240
I never entered the numbers.

40:10.825 --> 40:12.826
I never pressed the button.

40:20.085 --> 40:21.543
You're lying.

40:25.173 --> 40:27.132
No, I'm done lying.

40:39.145 --> 40:40.646
Dave!

40:43.108 --> 40:44.691
Who's Dave?

40:45.902 --> 40:49.780
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

40:49.864 --> 40:52.491
How did you know where I was?

40:52.575 --> 40:57.538
- Jin saw you while he was fishing.
- Ha! Jin doesn't speak English.

40:57.622 --> 41:02.543
Sun was with him. She translated.
Hurley, what is going on?

41:02.627 --> 41:05.587
No! You're just the part of me
that's scared.

41:08.049 --> 41:10.175
You don't want me to wake up.

41:10.260 --> 41:12.636
Well, guess what? I'm not scared.

41:14.389 --> 41:19.143
OK, Hurley,
you're having some sort of panic attack.

41:19.227 --> 41:20.853
I get that.

41:21.813 --> 41:27.359
- But this isn't like you.
- Like me? You don't know me.

41:27.443 --> 41:29.111
I was starting to.

41:29.195 --> 41:33.157
Yeah, well, did you know I'm so fat
that I killed two people?

41:33.241 --> 41:35.325
And that I have an imaginary friend?

41:35.410 --> 41:38.453
Hurley, please.
You're gonna hurt yourself.

41:38.538 --> 41:42.416
No, I'm not!
Because this isn't happening.

41:42.500 --> 41:44.751
None of it. I'm just imagining it.

41:44.836 --> 41:46.628
This isn't real life.

41:46.713 --> 41:49.006
Why would you say that?

41:49.090 --> 41:51.091
Because in real life...

41:55.597 --> 41:57.931
...no girl like you would ever like me.

42:02.520 --> 42:05.522
You remember when I said
I knew you from somewhere?

42:07.567 --> 42:09.902
Well, maybe it's 'cause I made you up.

42:17.035 --> 42:19.870
What was the man's name
who broke his leg?

42:22.123 --> 42:24.875
The day of the crash.
On the other side of the island,

42:24.959 --> 42:27.878
Eko brought a man
with a broken leg to me for help.

42:27.962 --> 42:29.880
What was his name?

42:30.548 --> 42:32.341
I don't know.

42:33.218 --> 42:35.219
You don't know. You know why?

42:36.054 --> 42:38.138
Because it happened to me.

42:41.684 --> 42:45.395
His name was Donald, and I buried him.

42:45.480 --> 42:48.065
I buried a lot of people, Hurley.

42:48.149 --> 42:50.484
So don't tell me that
that wasn't real.

42:52.987 --> 42:56.823
And don't tell me you made me up.

42:58.493 --> 43:00.410
It's insulting.

43:06.000 --> 43:10.796
When you saw me on the beach
this morning, was I holding a slipper?

43:11.839 --> 43:15.467
No, not that I can remember, no.

43:18.763 --> 43:20.347
Hurley...

43:22.892 --> 43:24.643
look at me.

43:26.688 --> 43:28.939
I am real.

43:30.900 --> 43:32.985
You're real.

43:34.195 --> 43:38.740
The way I feel about you, that's real.

43:58.052 --> 44:01.555
And that was real.

44:07.145 --> 44:09.229
Maybe you should do it one more time.

44:10.273 --> 44:11.857
Just to be sure.

44:21.284 --> 44:23.410
Ready to go back?

44:37.508 --> 44:42.346
Do you really think I can,
you know, change?

44:43.598 --> 44:45.015
Yeah.

44:46.559 --> 44:48.060
Yeah, I do.

44:54.692 --> 44:57.444
Why don't you
get a little closer together?

45:00.490 --> 45:02.324
- Say cheese!
- Cheese!

45:03.826 --> 45:05.660
Great.

45:05.745 --> 45:07.621
You need some water to go with that?

45:07.705 --> 45:10.207
- Nope, I'm good.
- OK. Well, fine.

45:10.291 --> 45:13.001
See you later, guys.
Thanks for the photo op.

45:15.630 --> 45:17.631
Here's your pill, Libby.
