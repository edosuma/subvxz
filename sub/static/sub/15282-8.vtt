TRACEY'S NOT HERE.

34:31.833 --> 34:34.167
TRACEY LAMBERT?
SHE'S NOT HERE.

34:39.132 --> 34:41.434
FBI! DON'T MOVE!

34:41.434 --> 34:43.199
GET YOUR HANDS
WHERE I CAN SEE 'EM.

34:43.199 --> 34:44.567
DO IT NOW!

34:44.567 --> 34:46.400
FEYLINN!

34:47.734 --> 34:50.033
I GOT HIM.

34:52.067 --> 34:53.400
GET UP. GET UP.

34:56.132 --> 34:57.367
WHERE'S TRACEY LAMBERT?

35:00.167 --> 35:02.033
LET'S GO.

35:15.067 --> 35:18.467
FRANCISCO GOYA,
KNOWN AS THE BLACK PAINTINGS.

35:18.467 --> 35:21.167
LORENZ'S NOTES SAY THAT
FEYLINN WAS EXPOSED TO THEM

35:21.167 --> 35:23.701
AS PART OF HIS
THERAPEUTIC ART THERAPY.

35:23.701 --> 35:24.934
I DON'T THINK
IT WORKED.

35:24.934 --> 35:26.834
HE KILLS THEM
AFTER 72 HOURS.

35:26.834 --> 35:28.234
TRACEY'S BEEN GONE FOR 24.

35:28.234 --> 35:30.701
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND OUT
WHERE SHE IS.

35:30.701 --> 35:32.868
DO WHAT I CAN.

35:49.033 --> 35:52.200
"KOBE GIRL STEAK," HUH?

35:52.200 --> 35:54.033
THAT'S WHERE YOU MASSAGE
THE MEAT, RIGHT?

35:54.033 --> 35:57.734
FLOYD, THESE ARE
SOME PRETTY UNUSUAL RECIPES
YOU GOT HERE.

35:57.734 --> 35:59.300
YOU TRY 'EM ALL?

36:00.667 --> 36:02.200
HMM?

36:02.200 --> 36:04.200
MUST HAVE TRIED
SOME OF THEM, RIGHT?

36:04.200 --> 36:05.868
TALK TO ME.

36:05.868 --> 36:08.033
WHICH ONES
DID YOU TRY?

36:08.033 --> 36:10.901
THEY HAVE
A SMILEY-FACE BY THEM.

36:10.901 --> 36:13.868
OTHERS HAVE
A FROWNY-FACE.

36:16.968 --> 36:18.400
THEY SURE DO.

36:18.400 --> 36:19.701
WHY?

36:19.701 --> 36:22.033
THEY DIDN'T
TURN OUT SO GOOD.

36:23.300 --> 36:24.701
WELL, THANK YOU FOR THAT.

36:26.467 --> 36:28.567
YOU HEAR VOICES, FLOYD?

36:30.434 --> 36:32.534
I'M NOT SMART.

36:33.767 --> 36:36.501
BUT I HAVE
A SMART FRIEND
WHO TELLS ME THINGS.

36:36.501 --> 36:39.400
WHAT'S YOUR
SMART FRIEND'S NAME?

36:39.400 --> 36:41.601
HE WANTS ME
TO TELL YOU SOMETHIN'.

36:41.601 --> 36:43.300
TELL ME WHAT?

36:43.300 --> 36:45.133
YOUR WATCH
HAS STOPPED.

36:55.767 --> 36:57.400
HE'S TRYIN'
TO SPOOK HIM.

36:57.400 --> 37:00.100
IT WON'T WORK.
Morgan: YEAH. UM...

37:00.100 --> 37:02.067
I WAS MEANIN'
TO CHANGE THE BATTERIES
OVER A MONTH AGO.

37:13.934 --> 37:16.868
YOU KNOW, WE THOUGHT YOU
CHOSE ATHLETICALLY BUILT WOMEN

37:16.868 --> 37:19.167
BECAUSE YOU WERE
ATTRACTED TO THEM,

37:19.167 --> 37:21.400
BUT THAT WAS ONLY
PART OF IT, RIGHT?

37:23.634 --> 37:27.100
LIKE A WOMAN WITH A LITTLE
MEAT ON HER BONES, DON'T YOU?

37:27.100 --> 37:29.801
MAKES FOR BETTER RECIPES,
DOESN'T IT?

37:29.801 --> 37:31.167
HMM?

37:31.167 --> 37:33.133
SOMETHIN' I'M MISSIN'?

37:33.133 --> 37:35.901
SKINNY ONES TAKE DRUGS.

37:35.901 --> 37:37.534
SO, WHAT, YOU DON'T
LIKE DRUG USERS?

37:37.534 --> 37:39.434
THEY TASTE FUNNY.

37:43.200 --> 37:45.801
WHERE'S TRACEY LAMBERT,
FLOYD?

37:45.801 --> 37:48.734
I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO TELL YOU.

37:48.734 --> 37:51.300
I'M ONLY SUPPOSED
TO TELL FATHER MARKS.

37:54.634 --> 37:56.400
I'M GONNA
STOP TALKIN' NOW.

38:00.167 --> 38:01.801
HE'S RIGHT THERE.

38:01.801 --> 38:04.234
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

38:24.701 --> 38:27.834
YOU GOTTA LET ME
DO ALL THE TALKIN'.
YOU HEAR ME?

38:47.267 --> 38:49.133
THANK YOU FOR COMIN',
FATHER.

38:49.133 --> 38:51.901
ANYTHING I CAN DO TO--

38:51.901 --> 38:56.834
FLOYD, I HAD TO PULL
SOME SERIOUS STRINGS
TO GET HIM HERE.

38:56.834 --> 38:59.567
MY BOSSES DIDN'T
LIKE THE IDEA AT ALL
OF SENDIN' HIM IN.

38:59.567 --> 39:02.467
NOW, THEY'RE GONNA
ALLOW HIM TO SIT
RIGHT HERE AND LISTEN,

39:02.467 --> 39:04.067
BUT YOU'RE GONNA TALK
TO ME, ALL RIGHT?

39:04.067 --> 39:06.033
OK.

39:06.033 --> 39:09.968
I'VE DONE SOME
REALLY BAD THINGS.

39:09.968 --> 39:12.934
EVERYBODY'S DONE THINGS
THEY'RE NOT PROUD OF, FLOYD.

39:12.934 --> 39:14.801
THE ONLY THING THAT HELPS
IS TO TALK ABOUT 'EM,

39:14.801 --> 39:16.968
TELL OTHER PEOPLE.

39:16.968 --> 39:18.834
THINGS ARE ALWAYS BETTER
AFTER YOU TALK ABOUT 'EM.

39:18.834 --> 39:21.300
NOT EVERYTHING.

39:21.300 --> 39:23.234
Rossi: THIS IS STRANGE.

39:23.234 --> 39:24.567
WHEN HE ENTERED
THE PARK,

39:24.567 --> 39:26.501
FEYLINN SIGNED
THE VOLUNTEER
SIGN-IN SHEET,

39:26.501 --> 39:30.200
BUT HIS NAME'S
NOT ON THE LIST
OF SEARCHERS.

39:32.801 --> 39:34.467
Morgan: COME ON, FLOYD.

39:34.467 --> 39:36.334
I GOT HIM HERE
LIKE YOU ASKED.

39:36.334 --> 39:38.067
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN.

39:38.067 --> 39:39.968
TELL US.

39:39.968 --> 39:41.467
WHERE IS TRACEY LAMBERT?

39:41.467 --> 39:43.834
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

39:43.834 --> 39:48.400
FATHER, I FEEL SO ALONE.

39:49.767 --> 39:52.334
I FEEL LIKE GOD
HAS ABANDONED ME.

39:58.100 --> 40:00.267
WHY?

40:03.267 --> 40:05.834
YOU ARE NOT ALONE, MY SON.

40:05.834 --> 40:07.367
GOD IS IN ALL OF US.

40:09.767 --> 40:12.000
WE NEED TO STOP
THE INTERVIEW.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.701
SO IS
TRACEY LAMBERT.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.567
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

40:22.567 --> 40:24.133
[CHUCKLING]

40:24.133 --> 40:25.200
YOU SON OF--

40:25.200 --> 40:26.868
FATHER MARKS!
FATHER MARKS, NO!

40:26.868 --> 40:29.133
COME ON! NO! HELP!

40:29.133 --> 40:30.701
YOU SON OF A BITCH!

40:32.167 --> 40:34.100
HE WAS FEEDING
THE VOLUNTEERS.

[FEYLINN CHUCKLING]

Morgan: 16th-CENTURY
ENGLISH NOVELIST
THOMAS DELONEY WROTE,

40:50.400 --> 40:53.901
"GOD SENDS MEAT,
AND THE DEVIL SENDS COOKS."

40:53.901 --> 40:56.400
BLAMING THE DEVIL
FOR HIS CANNIBALISM

40:56.400 --> 40:58.100
WASN'T ENOUGH
TO LESSEN HIS GUILT,

40:58.100 --> 41:01.100
SO HE TRICKED OTHERS
INTO PARTICIPATING.

41:01.100 --> 41:03.534
HE MADE THEM ALL
AS GUILTY AS HE WAS.

41:03.534 --> 41:06.501
HE CAUGHT EVERY BREAK
POSSIBLE, ROSSI.

41:06.501 --> 41:08.667
GETS RELEASED
FROM THE HOSPITAL.

41:08.667 --> 41:10.501
HIS RECORDS GET DESTROYED.

41:10.501 --> 41:13.734
GETS PULLED OVER
WITH A VICTIM
IN THE TRUNK OF HIS CAR,

41:13.734 --> 41:15.634
AND THEY LET HIM GO.

41:16.934 --> 41:19.868
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE
THAT LUCKY.

41:19.868 --> 41:21.934
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

41:21.934 --> 41:25.501
YOU BEEN DOIN' THIS A LONG TIME.
YOU'VE SEEN A LOT OF THINGS.

41:25.501 --> 41:28.334
YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT FEYLINN WOULD--

41:28.334 --> 41:33.400
I DON'T KNOW. THAT HE WAS
GETTIN' SOME KIND OF HELP

41:33.400 --> 41:35.033
FROM SOMETHIN' ELSE?

41:35.033 --> 41:37.534
IT'S IRRELEVANT.

41:37.534 --> 41:40.601
THE JOB IS TO FIND EVIL,
TO STOP IT,

41:40.601 --> 41:42.367
NOT TO KNOW
WHERE IT CAME FROM.

41:43.467 --> 41:46.100
LET SOMEBODY ELSE
TAKE THAT JOB.

41:46.100 --> 41:48.601
THIS ONE'S TOUGH ENOUGH.

41:51.934 --> 41:55.334
YOU KNOW,
REID WAS RIGHT.

41:56.534 --> 41:58.100
ABOUT?

42:00.033 --> 42:02.734
IF YOU BELIEVE IN ONE,

42:02.734 --> 42:05.701
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE
IN THE OTHER.

42:44.868 --> 42:47.968
I--I REALLY ENJOYED
MYSELF TONIGHT.

42:47.968 --> 42:50.167
ME, TOO.
I GUESS IT'S LUCKY

42:50.167 --> 42:53.367
MY LAPTOP FROZE UP
ON ME WHEN IT DID.

42:53.367 --> 42:56.133
UH, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT LUCK,

42:56.133 --> 42:58.934
BUT IT WAS AWFULLY GOOD
THAT I WAS THERE TO FIX IT.

42:58.934 --> 43:01.100
YOU DON'T
BELIEVE IN LUCK?

43:01.100 --> 43:03.467
NOT REALLY, NO.

43:03.467 --> 43:06.634
HUH. DO YOU BELIEVE
IN COINCIDENCES?

43:06.634 --> 43:09.968
I BELIEVE THAT
EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR
A REALLY GOOD REASON.
