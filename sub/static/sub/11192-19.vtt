WEBVTT

00:25.800 --> 00:28.291
Good morning, campers.

00:40.799 --> 00:45.758
There is damage here. It appears to
have been done by Goa'uld weaponry.

00:45.639 --> 00:48.509
I do not believe this battle
took place recently.

00:48.479 --> 00:50.603
- No bodies.
- Daniel,

00:50.598 --> 00:53.469
do you recognise any of these symbols?

00:58.439 --> 01:01.225
No. This place is definitely alien.

01:06.477 --> 01:11.057
- I wonder what's behind curtain No. 2.
- Take Carter and check it out.

01:15.718 --> 01:17.509
Whoa!

01:18.799 --> 01:23.176
Teal'c, you ever see
anything like this before?

01:28.878 --> 01:32.246
We must return to Earth
as quickly as possible.

01:32.198 --> 01:34.320
Why? What is that?

01:34.317 --> 01:36.393
It is the symbol of Korosh-ni.

01:36.396 --> 01:40.442
It is for any Goa'uld or Jaffa
who may pass through the gate.

01:40.356 --> 01:42.895
Loosely translated, it means turn back.

01:43.796 --> 01:46.668
Does it elaborate?

01:46.637 --> 01:52.805
It is placed on worlds Goa'uld destroyers
have wiped out and left contaminated.

01:52.637 --> 01:57.097
This planet's entire surface will be,
in your terms, radioactive.

01:56.996 --> 01:59.996
- Ah.
- No one will be left alive.

01:59.956 --> 02:01.615
This place is not safe.

02:10.634 --> 02:14.086
- I think this is a lab.
- How do you know?

02:14.036 --> 02:17.239
These are things they brought
from other planets to study.

02:17.195 --> 02:20.646
They're all tagged.
This is a Turkanese mask,

02:20.596 --> 02:24.925
this is a clay cone from Lagash
with cuneiform symbols on it.

02:24.835 --> 02:26.875
<i>Carter! Daniel!</i>

02:26.875 --> 02:29.627
Found the souvenir shop, sir.

02:29.594 --> 02:31.884
- We're outta here.
- What? Why?

02:31.875 --> 02:35.574
This is a treasure chest of artefacts
from diverse human cultures.

02:35.514 --> 02:38.432
Daniel, I don't wanna hear it. Let's go.

02:42.354 --> 02:44.846
You don't wanna hear it.

03:28.551 --> 03:31.469
<i>Daniel, we're leaving! Let's go!</i>

03:41.671 --> 03:47.175
You guys, I need a hand with this thing!
It's heavy, but we have to take it...

03:47.031 --> 03:48.775
back.

03:54.352 --> 03:55.811
Jack?

03:58.950 --> 04:00.409
Sam?!

04:01.350 --> 04:02.810
Teal'c?!

04:10.311 --> 04:13.228
Oh, I really hate it when this happens.

04:34.590 --> 04:36.168
<i>Close the iris!</i>

04:50.668 --> 04:53.918
Hands on your head, now!
Or we will open fire.

04:55.069 --> 04:57.524
- What's going on?
- Identify yourself.

04:57.509 --> 05:00.129
Daniel Jackson, SG-1.

05:03.389 --> 05:05.961
General, what's this all about?

05:05.947 --> 05:09.067
"General"? Do you see stars
anywhere on my uniform?

05:09.028 --> 05:11.862
<i>- Colonel, he says he's on SG-1.
- "Colonel"?</i>

05:11.827 --> 05:15.279
How did you get an SG-1
remote iris-deactivation device?

05:15.228 --> 05:17.470
What are you talking about?

05:18.389 --> 05:21.259
<i>Unauthorised incoming travellers.</i>

05:21.228 --> 05:23.518
<i>Who the hell are you?</i>

06:26.985 --> 06:31.112
I am Dr. Daniel Jackson, SG-1.
I need to see Jack O'Neill.

06:31.024 --> 06:33.314
- Ask Sam Carter!
- On the table!

06:34.465 --> 06:37.134
I'm not a Goa'uld! Don't give me that.

06:37.105 --> 06:39.180
Where's Dr. Fraiser? Don't give me that!

06:39.183 --> 06:40.643
Argh!

06:42.425 --> 06:44.963
I am Dr. Daniel Jackson.

06:44.944 --> 06:47.151
I need to see Colonel O'Neill.

06:47.144 --> 06:49.386
Do you mean General O'Neill?

07:36.983 --> 07:38.098
Hello?!

07:40.822 --> 07:43.312
I have to speak to someone!

08:00.901 --> 08:03.523
- Catherine.
- You know me?

08:03.500 --> 08:05.161
Of course.

08:07.021 --> 08:11.185
- You don't know me?
- Dr. Daniel Jackson. Linguist.

08:11.100 --> 08:15.348
Ancient Egyptian historian. Better known
for some of your more radical ideas.

08:15.262 --> 08:19.093
At the moment, I'm more interested in
how you came through my Stargate.

08:19.021 --> 08:23.730
<i>How I... Your Stargate?
What the hell is going on here, Catherine?</i>

08:23.620 --> 08:26.242
I'd prefer you address me as Dr. Langford.

08:26.220 --> 08:28.627
You were wearing a remote device.

08:28.620 --> 08:31.194
You had SG-1's code.
How did you obtain it?

08:31.180 --> 08:34.014
How did I...? How do you think I did it?

08:34.980 --> 08:38.313
I left from here, Stargate Command.
Today. A few hours ago.

08:38.899 --> 08:42.269
I went through on a mission to P3R-233.

08:42.220 --> 08:44.544
What are you talking about?

08:44.538 --> 08:47.113
You've never been in this facility
until now.

08:47.100 --> 08:48.677
OK.

08:48.698 --> 08:53.527
Um... I figured out
how to work the Stargate.

08:53.418 --> 08:57.167
You recruited me to translate
the cartouche found at Giza.

08:57.100 --> 09:00.717
I went on the first mission
through the Stargate to Abydos.

09:00.659 --> 09:03.826
And unless the last two years
have been some wacky dream,

09:03.778 --> 09:06.484
I am a member of SG-1.

09:06.457 --> 09:08.416
Not as far as I'm concerned.

09:09.259 --> 09:11.251
- What?!
- I supervised the team

09:11.258 --> 09:13.465
that translated the cartouche at Giza.

09:13.457 --> 09:16.957
<i>- You did?!
- I admit we referenced your work.</i>

09:17.379 --> 09:21.542
I even went to one of your seminars
to ask you to join us, but you said no.

09:21.457 --> 09:23.700
- I did?
- You were quite rude, actually.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.985
I was?

09:27.658 --> 09:30.149
The MRI confirms you are not a Goa'uld.

09:30.138 --> 09:32.842
- Could I see Captain Carter?
- Samantha Carter?

09:32.817 --> 09:36.352
- Yes!
- She's not in the military. She's a doctor.

09:36.298 --> 09:41.636
PhD Astrophysics. She's attending to
more important business at the moment.

09:41.496 --> 09:44.283
Don't you have any explanation for this?

09:44.258 --> 09:45.966
God, no!

09:45.976 --> 09:49.927
Catherine! I mean, Dr. Langford.
No, this doesn't make any sense!

09:49.856 --> 09:53.640
I know you. I belong here!

09:53.576 --> 09:55.284
You don't!

09:55.496 --> 09:57.572
Excuse me?

09:57.937 --> 10:01.388
You're retired.
At least, the air force made you retire.

10:01.336 --> 10:05.749
You're supposed to be at home,
living happily ever after with Ernest.

10:06.576 --> 10:08.403
What?

10:08.416 --> 10:12.543
The man you were
supposed to marry in 1945.

10:16.895 --> 10:21.474
We've only got 50% of the list
through to Beta site, General.

10:21.375 --> 10:24.293
Voyager is still en route.

10:24.255 --> 10:28.467
- Excuse me. I know you're busy.
- It's all right, Catherine. What is it?

10:28.815 --> 10:31.352
I think you should meet
this young man, Jack.

10:31.336 --> 10:33.542
- Now?
- How much time do we have?

10:33.695 --> 10:36.186
Why?

10:36.174 --> 10:38.417
He... knows things.

10:45.614 --> 10:48.780
- Jack!
- Look, we're in the middle of a situation.

10:48.735 --> 10:53.230
I don't know who you are, but Dr. Langford
says you might be able to help us.

10:54.053 --> 10:57.054
OK, this is starting to get
a little bit spooky.

10:57.014 --> 11:01.971
A few hours ago,
everything about this place was different.

11:01.854 --> 11:05.803
I mean, well, not completely different.
I mean, you're still you...

11:06.014 --> 11:08.683
Sort of.

11:11.173 --> 11:14.376
- What can you tell me about the Goa'uld?
- What?!

11:14.333 --> 11:16.658
The Goa'uld. You know who they are?

11:16.653 --> 11:18.610
Uh... yeah.

11:19.212 --> 11:21.750
Tell me what you know.

11:21.732 --> 11:25.101
OK. Maybe I've completely
lost my mind here,

11:25.052 --> 11:29.514
but as far as I'm concerned
we know each other very well.

11:29.413 --> 11:32.081
You know everything that I know.

11:33.611 --> 11:38.024
I am a member of SG-1 with you,
Captain Carter and Teal'c!

11:38.971 --> 11:41.130
Where is Teal'c?

11:41.133 --> 11:44.298
Big guy. Gold emblem on his head.
Goa'uld in his stomach.

11:44.251 --> 11:47.418
- A Jaffa?
- Yes. He's our friend.

11:48.772 --> 11:50.977
Get this man outta here. Now.

11:51.451 --> 11:54.452
How'd he come to the gate?
How does he know all this?

11:54.412 --> 11:56.284
You say you solved the gate without me.

11:56.292 --> 12:00.456
Did you still go to Abydos intending
to blow up a nuclear device?

12:04.011 --> 12:07.215
- How did you know that?
- You were willing to commit suicide

12:07.172 --> 12:12.047
because your son had recently died.
He shot himself with your gun, right?

12:13.491 --> 12:16.361
I swear I didn't tell him anything.

12:18.051 --> 12:21.918
- So, did you still go to Chulak?
- What is Chulak?

12:22.769 --> 12:25.522
- The Jaffa home world.
- You know the symbols?

12:25.889 --> 12:27.764
Yes.

12:29.411 --> 12:32.280
- Do you want me to write it down?
- Yes!

12:35.610 --> 12:41.861
So, if you've never been to Chulak,
you've probably never... met... Teal'c.

12:42.250 --> 12:45.334
- "Teal"?
- No, Teal'c!

12:45.289 --> 12:48.290
Everything's screwed up. Why?!

12:50.969 --> 12:52.961
Sam!

12:55.330 --> 12:57.369
- Who is this?
- Dr. Jackson.

12:57.370 --> 13:00.073
He came through the gate
with an SG-1 remote code.

13:00.048 --> 13:02.125
Report, Doctor.

13:03.129 --> 13:06.332
We've lost Washington
and Philadelphia, sir.

13:10.048 --> 13:12.539
I'm sorry. What do you mean by lost?

13:15.687 --> 13:17.976
Show him.

13:35.727 --> 13:38.349
Every one of those red dots
is a destroyed city.

13:43.727 --> 13:46.100
<i>Dr Carter, there's another report.</i>

13:46.086 --> 13:50.879
<i>Military efforts to engage the alien
ships have proven inconsequentiaI.</i>

13:50.767 --> 13:54.135
- The Goa'uld?
- The ships appeared four days ago.

13:54.086 --> 13:59.044
<i>They have slowly begun systematically
annihilating all signs of civilisation,</i>

13:58.927 --> 14:00.884
<i>starting on the East Coast</i>

14:00.885 --> 14:04.552
<i>and moving west with
frightening inevitability.</i>

14:04.485 --> 14:08.947
<i>There has been no response to attempted
communications with the aliens.</i>

14:09.446 --> 14:11.854
<i>Thus far, they have left no survivors</i>

14:11.846 --> 14:17.221
<i>in the wake of their seemingly
unstoppable wave of destruction.</i>

14:18.645 --> 14:22.144
I feel like the victim of
the biggest practical joke ever.

14:22.086 --> 14:24.624
You got all this on the alien planet?

14:24.605 --> 14:29.231
Uh, yeah, with the exception
of the gun and the grenade.

14:29.125 --> 14:34.664
I found this lab. They obviously collected
things they found on other planets.

14:34.524 --> 14:38.818
There was this mirror. Could've been
made of naqahdah, the gate element.

14:38.725 --> 14:41.892
Jack said we were leaving.
I touched the mirror.

14:41.846 --> 14:44.597
Interesting. What is it?

14:44.764 --> 14:47.600
I have no idea.

14:48.244 --> 14:51.778
- You said you touched a mirror?
- I touched that thing first.

14:51.724 --> 14:55.638
It turned on, I heard a noise,
that's when I noticed the shimmering.

14:55.565 --> 14:57.522
Maybe this is what controls it.

14:57.524 --> 15:00.015
When I touched the mirror,
there was this surge.

15:00.004 --> 15:02.673
Like an electrical shock, just for a second.

15:02.644 --> 15:05.929
And then I went to find Jack,
Sam, and Teal'c.

15:05.884 --> 15:08.340
- He's the Jaffa?
- Yes!

15:08.323 --> 15:11.443
But I couldn't find them.
It was like they were gone.

15:11.403 --> 15:16.777
So, I figured they left without me. I dialled
Earth's address, came through, and I...

15:17.562 --> 15:19.889
What the hell are they doing down there?

15:24.923 --> 15:27.413
<i>Chevron one encoded.</i>

15:32.883 --> 15:35.171
<i>Chevron two encoded.</i>

15:37.643 --> 15:39.053
<i>Chevron three encoded.</i>

15:39.082 --> 15:42.866
Isn't our mission to get
the genesis list through to the Beta site?

15:42.802 --> 15:45.673
I think we'll try to
stop the attack on Earth first.

15:45.643 --> 15:48.049
Genesis list? Beta site?
What does she mean?

15:48.042 --> 15:50.960
We're evacuating everyone we can
to another planet.

15:50.922 --> 15:53.460
World leaders, scientists, doctors.

15:54.361 --> 15:57.363
<i>Chevron five encoded.</i>

15:59.721 --> 16:02.889
You're sending
a nuclear weapon to Chulak?

16:02.841 --> 16:06.176
- You got a problem with that?
- The Jaffa are just slaves.

16:06.801 --> 16:09.505
Try to comprehend what's going on here.

16:09.481 --> 16:13.313
We estimate the death toll to Earth
as 1.5 billion.

16:14.162 --> 16:18.408
Who do you think is flying those ships,
trying to blow up our world?

16:18.321 --> 16:21.488
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't be striking back.

16:21.441 --> 16:23.932
Chevron seven locked.

16:26.679 --> 16:29.764
They have no choice.

16:29.721 --> 16:32.294
- Send the bomb.
- Proceed with deployment.

16:43.440 --> 16:47.604
Proceed with evacuation
until that next warhead is ready.

16:47.519 --> 16:51.186
There are innocent human beings
on Goa'uld planets.

16:53.080 --> 16:57.408
Unless this man has more information
we can use, I don't wanna see him again.

17:03.438 --> 17:07.188
This isn't happening, this is nuts,
this isn't happening...

17:13.597 --> 17:20.347
Is it... is it possible that the Stargate...
malfunctioned or went haywire,

17:20.156 --> 17:24.320
and I came through into a totally
screwed-up different version of Earth?

17:24.239 --> 17:30.324
No, I doubt that. The Stargate allows us
to travel across great distances,

17:30.157 --> 17:32.566
but it doesn't take you
to an alternate reality.

17:32.558 --> 17:33.673
Alternate reality?

17:33.718 --> 17:38.344
Scientists have theorised that there
are an infinite number of dimensions,

17:38.238 --> 17:40.810
each containing
a different possible reality.

17:40.797 --> 17:45.173
<i>Well, it sounds like I theoretically,
possibly actually found one.</i>

17:45.077 --> 17:50.202
- One what?
- What Sam said. An... alternate reality.

17:50.076 --> 17:54.122
That would explain why everything here
is the same, but different.

17:54.037 --> 17:58.201
The theory is that there are
an infinite number of alternate realities.

17:58.117 --> 18:01.237
Some are very different,
some are almost identical.

18:01.196 --> 18:03.688
That has to be what this is!

18:07.876 --> 18:11.744
This isn't my world at all.
This is some sort of...

18:12.596 --> 18:14.173
other dimension?

18:14.195 --> 18:16.438
The Stargate wouldn't cause that.

18:16.436 --> 18:20.565
- Maybe the Stargate didn't cause it.
- What are you suggesting?

18:20.476 --> 18:24.009
He found a mirror, possibly
made of naqahdah, on P3R-233.

18:23.955 --> 18:27.905
<i>- All this happened after I touched it.
- P3R-233?</i>

18:27.836 --> 18:29.875
- Have you been there?
- Yes!

18:29.875 --> 18:31.915
Offworld activation.

18:34.154 --> 18:36.278
Close blast doors. Keep the iris sealed.

18:36.276 --> 18:38.849
Receiving coded transmission
from Air Force One.

18:38.836 --> 18:42.536
Notify General O'Neill.
Get the genesis travellers ready.

18:42.474 --> 18:43.756
Right.

19:13.874 --> 19:16.744
Current address unknown.
Phone number unknown.

19:16.713 --> 19:18.873
Last place of residence...

19:19.794 --> 19:22.118
Egypt, as of 1997.

19:30.992 --> 19:32.238
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

19:32.272 --> 19:34.597
What?

19:34.593 --> 19:37.547
- I think I'm dead.
- What?

19:37.512 --> 19:39.801
The me in this reality.

19:40.032 --> 19:41.906
What is Voyager's status?

19:41.913 --> 19:45.613
The president's plane is ten minutes
from Peterson Air Force Base.

19:45.551 --> 19:50.048
- Another coded transmission.
- Relay it through the decoder.

19:51.392 --> 19:55.555
<i>Enemy craft.
Pursuit. Cannot evade.</i>

19:56.392 --> 19:58.468
Surface radar is tracking.

20:03.271 --> 20:06.307
- That's one of their big ones.
- Look how fast it's moving.

20:06.551 --> 20:09.672
<i>Under fire! Help... us!</i>

20:21.391 --> 20:24.807
<i>- It's heading straight for us.
- Confirm, airman.</i>

20:24.750 --> 20:29.875
- ETA, one minute.
- Dammit! The evacuation gave us away.

20:29.750 --> 20:33.878
Intelligence confirms that enemy fire
can reach us, even this far underground.

20:33.789 --> 20:35.997
We're stuck here.

20:35.990 --> 20:39.193
Enemy ship is slowing.
Visual tracking in 10 seconds.

20:56.990 --> 21:00.276
If they fire on us,
chances are we won't even feel it.

21:00.230 --> 21:04.309
The blasts on the East Coast were equal
to 200-megaton nuclear warheads.

21:04.548 --> 21:07.005
- It's not gonna fire.
- What?

21:13.388 --> 21:15.676
It's landing.

21:25.308 --> 21:30.433
The surveillance cameras show Jaffa
assembling what appears to be a weapon.

21:30.307 --> 21:32.634
They're coming in the front door.

21:32.627 --> 21:36.211
Position automatic weapons here.
And men in all these halls.

21:36.147 --> 21:40.276
Cut off access to this level.
Blow the secondary elevator shaft now.

21:40.186 --> 21:42.429
If the men at the surface have to fall back,

21:42.427 --> 21:45.595
<i>there's only gonna be one way down.</i>

21:45.548 --> 21:50.294
I want all nonessential personnel
through the gate to the Beta site ASAP.

21:50.186 --> 21:52.677
Dr. Langford,
that includes you and our guest.

21:52.666 --> 21:56.878
Sir, the Goa'ulds have kept
a wormhole established from offworld.

21:56.787 --> 21:58.993
Probably because you sent that bomb.

21:58.987 --> 22:04.028
The point is, unless we get a chance to
open the gate from here, we're all stuck.

22:05.026 --> 22:08.809
- Recommendations?
- Normally, when we have full power,

22:08.747 --> 22:11.782
we can only keep a wormhole
established for a half-hour.

22:11.746 --> 22:15.743
There may be a restriction on how long
the Goa'ulds can keep theirs active.

22:15.666 --> 22:18.122
- So there's a time limit?
- Right.

22:29.425 --> 22:32.546
- Start it up. Count to five, then blow it.
- Yes, sir.

22:42.306 --> 22:43.765
Good luck.

22:43.785 --> 22:46.453
- Let's go. Take it up.
- Yes, sir.

22:50.865 --> 22:53.569
This sounds like a derivation
of ancient Egyptian.

22:53.544 --> 22:56.082
We couldn't recognise it.

22:56.065 --> 22:59.599
Oh, you didn't learn
how to speak it aloud on Abydos.

23:05.025 --> 23:09.271
- Where did this come from?
- A transmission about three months ago.

23:09.784 --> 23:12.108
So, why are you showing this to me now?

23:12.104 --> 23:16.268
The transmission came from
the same quadrant of space as P3R-233.

23:16.183 --> 23:19.470
<i>Where your mirror is.</i>

23:19.903 --> 23:24.613
We went to 233 after we received that,
but the civilisation had been destroyed.

23:24.503 --> 23:26.710
We didn't find any mirror.

23:34.064 --> 23:36.636
"Beware the destroyers."

23:36.623 --> 23:42.292
233's aliens must've sent out the warning
before their civilisation was destroyed.

23:44.343 --> 23:47.794
- And the rest?
- It says "They come from", but...

23:47.742 --> 23:50.151
the sentence is incomplete.

23:50.143 --> 23:52.715
There's just more sounds.
Pulses or beats.

23:52.702 --> 23:55.028
<i>We've analysed them.</i>

23:57.382 --> 24:04.345
They're divided into groups:
3, 32, 16, 8, 10 and 12.

24:08.102 --> 24:11.185
- That's six numbers.
- Yeah.

24:12.821 --> 24:15.989
That's a Stargate address,
just without the point of origin.

24:17.541 --> 24:23.128
"Beware the destroyers.
They come from 3, 32, 16, 8, 10 and 12."

24:22.980 --> 24:26.147
The aliens found out where
the Goa'uld attack originated?

24:26.101 --> 24:29.767
- Like a Goa'uld home world?
- Or at least a military base.

24:29.701 --> 24:33.318
They've assigned a number to each
symbol on the Stargate. It's a code.

24:33.820 --> 24:38.613
We just figure out the symbol they use
to represent 1, and start counting.

24:38.500 --> 24:42.000
The only unique symbol
they would have is for 233.

24:41.941 --> 24:44.230
That symbol may not be on our Stargate.

24:44.220 --> 24:46.971
Except I have the alien gate on tape.

24:46.940 --> 24:48.269
What?

24:52.980 --> 24:55.269
The gate is off!

24:57.299 --> 25:00.883
- Dial the gate for the Beta site.
- Chevron one encoded.

25:00.818 --> 25:04.864
If we dial before the Goa'ulds re-establish
a wormhole, we can get outta here.

25:06.419 --> 25:09.207
<i>- Chevron two.
- Can they dial in?</i>

25:09.179 --> 25:13.509
Yes. The seventh chevron must be locked
to stop an incoming wormhole.

25:13.419 --> 25:15.328
Chevron three encoded.

25:16.979 --> 25:19.055
- Everybody ready?
- Sir!

25:19.058 --> 25:21.347
Let's do it, boys.

25:37.538 --> 25:39.695
Chevron five encoded.

25:45.497 --> 25:47.371
Come on, come on, come on.

25:52.617 --> 25:55.073
- No!
- Offworld activation.

25:57.097 --> 26:00.265
You'll have to make the computer
dial in faster.

26:00.217 --> 26:02.673
How long can the Goa'uld
keep a wormhole active?

26:02.656 --> 26:08.243
Based on their last activation,
they can keep it open for...

26:08.097 --> 26:10.089
38 minutes.

26:10.096 --> 26:13.133
We may not have that much time.

26:15.695 --> 26:17.355
Fall back!

26:20.136 --> 26:21.382
Go! Go!

26:24.056 --> 26:25.965
Seal it off and move down!

26:48.454 --> 26:51.326
This symbol has to be the point of origin.

26:53.015 --> 26:57.723
- How's it going out there, General?
- We're getting the crap beat out of us.

26:57.615 --> 26:59.738
It'll be 25 before we can try again.

26:59.733 --> 27:03.862
And Dr. Langford has presented us
with an interesting dilemma.

27:03.775 --> 27:06.941
She thinks we have the address
to a Goa'uld home world,

27:06.894 --> 27:09.599
possibly where this attack originated.

27:09.574 --> 27:12.611
- We'll send a bomb through.
- Excuse me?

27:14.134 --> 27:17.549
Sorry. I know I'm an outsider,
but what good will that do?

27:18.212 --> 27:22.710
Forget that it won't change anything here.
How do you know they don't have an iris?

27:22.614 --> 27:27.655
- This could all be for nothing.
- We only have one shot at dialling out.

27:28.335 --> 27:32.462
<i>If we use that one chance to dial
a Goa'uld world, we'll never get out.</i>

27:39.173 --> 27:41.877
- My God.
- What the hell's that?

27:43.772 --> 27:46.310
My reality.

27:51.052 --> 27:56.094
We are actually looking at ourselves
in a parallel universe.

27:55.972 --> 27:59.971
Another version of our lives
that actually exists.

28:05.531 --> 28:08.865
- It's incredible.
- It's supposed to be theoretical.

28:08.811 --> 28:14.398
Not any more. What began with
Einstein's theories about relativity...

28:14.251 --> 28:17.787
- Who is this?
- That is Teal'c.

28:17.730 --> 28:21.266
Big guy, gold emblem on his head,
and Goa'uld in his stomach.

28:21.211 --> 28:26.122
We just saw him on the security camera.
He's the Jaffa that led the invasion.

28:26.010 --> 28:31.301
He was the first prime of Apophis.
He'd lead the most important mission.

28:31.171 --> 28:35.383
This may sound selfish, but where
I'm from none of this has happened.

28:35.290 --> 28:40.118
<i>- My Earth still has a chance.
- Do you want to explain that?</i>

28:40.010 --> 28:44.009
<i>If this is the address of the Goa'uld world
where this attack originated,</i>

28:43.931 --> 28:48.593
and I can tell my world, maybe I can
stop this before it starts there.

28:48.490 --> 28:52.903
What makes you think the Goa'ulds
will try attacking Earth in your universe?

28:52.810 --> 28:55.645
We've pissed the Goa'uld off
just as much as you have.

28:55.609 --> 28:58.147
Wait. Let me get this straight.

28:58.130 --> 29:01.414
You want us to give up our last chance
to hit the Goa'uld

29:01.369 --> 29:03.445
so we can save ourselves in a...

29:03.449 --> 29:05.276
- What?
- Alternate reality.

29:05.289 --> 29:08.326
<i>- Not just you. Everyone on Earth.
- Your Earth.</i>

29:08.289 --> 29:10.413
The Jack O'Neill I know would do it.

29:10.410 --> 29:12.486
Apparently, you and I have never met.

29:13.128 --> 29:16.083
No, I guess not.

29:17.009 --> 29:21.303
<i>Look, because I came here
I have seen what can happen.</i>

29:21.210 --> 29:27.046
<i>I have a chance to stop this happening
to the Earth I come from, if you help me.</i>

29:34.449 --> 29:36.691
How much time, Doctor?

29:37.769 --> 29:39.845
22 minutes.

29:39.848 --> 29:43.182
So the argument is academic.
We can't hold them that long.

29:45.366 --> 29:48.154
- Maybe we can buy some time.
- How?

29:48.127 --> 29:50.618
<i>Not how. Who.</i>

30:10.688 --> 30:15.978
Whoa... You're kidding, right?

30:16.646 --> 30:21.025
You saw the video. In my reality,
Jack convinced Teal'c to betray Apophis

30:20.926 --> 30:23.002
to save our lives.

30:23.007 --> 30:27.134
Teal'c gave up everything
so we could free his people from slavery.

30:27.046 --> 30:30.000
<i>It doesn't look like we could help him.</i>

30:29.965 --> 30:33.915
We sent a bomb to his planet.
There may be nothing for him to save.

30:33.846 --> 30:36.134
<i>Not in this universe.</i>

30:46.605 --> 30:50.685
- You expect me to explain all this to him?
- He's smart. He'll understand.

30:50.965 --> 30:54.500
How do you know he's like the Jaffa
you know in your universe?

30:54.445 --> 30:56.936
Not everything's the same here.

30:56.924 --> 30:59.131
No, it's not. But it is close.

30:59.125 --> 31:02.909
I know what I am asking here, it's insane.

31:06.045 --> 31:08.797
Look, if you don't want to help me,
I understand.

31:08.763 --> 31:11.385
It's your lives, and it's your world.

31:21.164 --> 31:26.621
All I have to do is buy a little time?
A few minutes to get the gate open, right?

31:26.483 --> 31:30.232
That video of that Jaffa and you
should catch his attention.

31:32.242 --> 31:35.114
You're going to talk to him
about alternate realities?

31:38.324 --> 31:41.574
Do you really think he's right
about this Jaffa?

31:41.522 --> 31:44.228
He was right about my son.

31:54.042 --> 31:56.118
Thank you.

32:01.323 --> 32:04.739
I think this is where
you all wish me good luck.

32:08.482 --> 32:10.807
Jack...

32:18.122 --> 32:20.199
Come here.

32:26.080 --> 32:28.654
I take it they're not engaged
in your reality?

32:29.201 --> 32:31.277
No.

32:38.682 --> 32:42.809
The enemy will most likely
penetrate this level any time now.

32:42.720 --> 32:44.759
But every minute counts.

32:44.760 --> 32:48.759
If we get the Stargate open,
we will retreat through it.

32:48.681 --> 32:54.055
But until then, we must keep them away
from the control room and the Stargate.

32:53.920 --> 32:57.005
<i>- Understood?
- Yes, sir!</i>

32:56.960 --> 32:59.118
Your efforts and dedication

32:59.121 --> 33:03.284
have always made me proud
to serve with all of you.

33:03.201 --> 33:06.949
- Bravo Company, move out.
- Formation three.

33:15.279 --> 33:16.607
Kree shak!

33:16.640 --> 33:19.212
Don't shoot! I'm unarmed.

33:21.919 --> 33:24.208
I surrender.

33:32.398 --> 33:35.019
- And you are?
- General Jack O'Neill.

33:34.999 --> 33:37.834
Commander of this base.

33:39.118 --> 33:40.695
You're Teal'c, right?

33:40.718 --> 33:43.007
- Hakka sha!
- Arik kree!

33:44.637 --> 33:47.638
You'll be wondering
how I know your name.

33:48.798 --> 33:51.549
I've got quite a story to tell you.

33:52.317 --> 33:55.021
I've got the dial-in time down
by five seconds.

33:54.998 --> 33:57.405
Now we need
that wormhole to destabilise.

34:00.157 --> 34:03.824
Airman, we're going to need
all the help we can get out there.

34:03.758 --> 34:06.675
Set the autodestruct sequence
to go off two minutes past

34:06.637 --> 34:09.425
the window of opportunity
for us to open the Stargate.

34:09.396 --> 34:14.188
If the Goa'ulds want this place
in one piece, I intend to disappoint them.

34:20.277 --> 34:22.684
<i>Destruct sequence activated.</i>

34:29.876 --> 34:32.449
What sort of deception is this?

34:33.597 --> 34:38.722
I know it's hard to believe,
but you guys are pretty advanced.

34:38.596 --> 34:43.590
You must know this alternate-reality thing
is possible, right?

34:43.476 --> 34:45.884
I do not.

34:45.876 --> 34:48.449
Then how did this Daniel guy
know your name?

34:49.356 --> 34:52.356
He says the guy in this video -

34:52.315 --> 34:54.556
you, I guess, in his world -

34:55.476 --> 34:57.717
hates being a slave to the Goa'ulds.

34:59.275 --> 35:01.351
Lies.

35:04.074 --> 35:06.114
Look...

35:06.114 --> 35:08.570
I know this sounds insane,

35:09.474 --> 35:13.851
but you have a chance
to change things in his world.

35:13.755 --> 35:16.505
We just need a little time, that's all.

35:22.394 --> 35:26.771
This guy Daniel says the Teal'c
in his world is a good man.

35:26.673 --> 35:32.592
That he betrayed the Goa'uld
for a chance to free his people, his family.

35:32.434 --> 35:35.719
Your wife. Your son Ryac.

35:40.753 --> 35:44.253
We received word from my home world.

35:44.193 --> 35:46.731
You sent a weapon of destruction there.

35:48.552 --> 35:50.130
My people,

35:50.152 --> 35:52.858
my family are dead.

36:22.150 --> 36:24.856
Four minutes.
You two get in the gate room.

36:25.552 --> 36:27.960
- Catherine...
- They need you at the Beta site.

36:27.952 --> 36:31.534
- What about you?
- I'll set the dial and join you. Go!

36:32.110 --> 36:35.693
If this mirror is a doorway between
dimensions, maybe I can send help,

36:35.632 --> 36:38.039
or even have you
come through to my Earth.

36:38.030 --> 36:41.862
Wait. If your device is a remote control
to the mirror, you may need it.

36:42.431 --> 36:44.637
Go ahead. I'll get it.

36:47.630 --> 36:49.706
Thank you.

36:50.791 --> 36:54.918
You'll help reunite me
with Ernest in the other world?

36:55.309 --> 36:58.679
I guess, in the grand scheme of things,
we're even.

37:33.588 --> 37:36.376
Fall back! We have to fall back!

37:53.588 --> 37:55.664
Two minutes!

37:56.748 --> 38:02.952
I surrender. I've information for Apophis.
Technology he will want to know about.

38:03.108 --> 38:06.940
This is a remote control
to an interdimensional portal.

38:06.867 --> 38:09.536
I can tell Apophis how to find it.

38:09.507 --> 38:11.797
Ashac tree-ac!

38:12.827 --> 38:14.903
Thank you.

38:15.706 --> 38:17.034
Oh, yeah.

38:17.668 --> 38:20.240
I also wish to blow us all to hell.

38:22.347 --> 38:24.469
Time's up!

38:42.306 --> 38:43.503
Come on!

39:03.146 --> 39:05.851
<i>Autodestruct in one minute.</i>

39:23.105 --> 39:25.393
<i>Autodestruct in 30 seconds.</i>

39:38.503 --> 39:40.994
<i>Autodestruct in 10 seconds.</i>

39:41.423 --> 39:46.300
<i>9, 8, 7, 6,</i>

39:46.182 --> 39:50.976
<i>5, 4, 3, 2,</i>

39:50.862 --> 39:52.322
<i>1.</i>

40:29.862 --> 40:32.733
- Any luck?
- Nothing.

40:32.701 --> 40:34.777
<i>Help!</i>

40:38.942 --> 40:41.018
Daniel!

40:42.981 --> 40:45.650
What the hell is this?

40:46.460 --> 40:49.331
It appears to have been caused
by a staff weapon.

40:53.940 --> 40:56.478
This looks like a Stargate address.

40:56.460 --> 40:59.461
- All right, let's get him back to Earth.
- No, Jack!

40:59.420 --> 41:02.090
We're all in very big trouble.

41:02.661 --> 41:04.949
They're coming.

41:07.500 --> 41:09.576
They're coming.
