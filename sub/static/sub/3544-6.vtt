00:02.160 --> 00:03.605
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:03.800 --> 00:05.006
- I'm Elena.
- I'm Stefan.

00:05.200 --> 00:08.409
<i>Love brought me to Mystic Falls.
Love drove me away.</i>

00:08.600 --> 00:10.967
- I love you, Damon.
- Silas.

00:11.160 --> 00:12.366
Hello, my shadow self.

00:13.800 --> 00:15.840
<i>Even though we've
lost almost everything...</i>

00:16.000 --> 00:17.331
Bonnie's dead, Elena.

00:17.520 --> 00:19.249
I have no idea who you people are.

00:19.440 --> 00:23.490
People are watching you and your friends.
Drop out, move back to Mystic Falls.

00:23.680 --> 00:24.960
<i>...our hope is not lost.</i>

00:25.120 --> 00:29.284
Silas' whole bad-guy plan was to kill himself,
reunite with his dead girlfriend, Amara.

00:29.480 --> 00:32.244
I wanna use his death
to bring Bonnie back to life.

00:32.439 --> 00:35.489
Silas was my true love,
I never said I was his.

00:35.720 --> 00:37.324
He wanted to be with Amara.

00:37.520 --> 00:42.321
Silas needs every last drop of your blood
to cure himself, Katherine.

00:44.840 --> 00:46.842
No, Damon, I don't wanna die.

00:47.880 --> 00:49.962
Am I in hell?

00:55.480 --> 00:58.370
Sure a little thing like
you can eat all that?

00:58.560 --> 01:01.689
I'm celebrating.
I thought I was gonna die.

01:01.880 --> 01:07.330
I didn't. So now I'm free to be
whatever I wanna be.

01:09.040 --> 01:11.407
It's a good day.

01:11.600 --> 01:14.524
Love the hair, by the way.
Bold choice.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.684
This is nice.

01:45.880 --> 01:47.530
It is nice.

01:48.080 --> 01:50.765
Quiet. Still. Peaceful.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.321
I like our life when it's like this.

01:54.400 --> 01:56.243
But it is our life.

01:56.440 --> 01:59.489
Which probably means something's gonna
walk through that door and shatter it.

01:59.720 --> 02:03.770
- Mm. Don't say that.
- In 10, nine...

02:03.960 --> 02:05.883
Just let me enjoy the moment.

02:06.080 --> 02:08.048
Six, five...

02:08.240 --> 02:11.289
Damon, today is the day
that we're gonna bring Bonnie back.

02:11.520 --> 02:12.601
It's a good day.

02:12.800 --> 02:16.646
- Three, two...
- Damon, it's a good day.

02:18.480 --> 02:21.290
- Greetings.
- One.

02:21.480 --> 02:23.482
Good morning, frenemies.

02:26.520 --> 02:27.885
Ah.

02:28.120 --> 02:31.249
You know, I'm only a few hours
into my old life as a witch...

02:31.440 --> 02:35.490
but somehow the sun feels warmer.

02:35.680 --> 02:39.571
Probably because I'm not cursed
with having to outlive it anymore. Ha, ha.

02:39.800 --> 02:42.451
What's with the home invasion, Silas?

02:42.680 --> 02:47.208
Well, Damon, after 2000 years
of a miserable existence...

02:48.960 --> 02:50.803
I finally get to die.

02:59.560 --> 03:01.688
Morning, sleepy head.

03:01.880 --> 03:02.927
Sleep well?

03:03.160 --> 03:04.321
Oh.

03:04.720 --> 03:07.929
Tessa. Hi. Ahem.

03:08.160 --> 03:12.609
You're confused.
Is that the amnesia or the tequila?

03:12.800 --> 03:17.966
Um, I think both. I'm still trying
to piece together last night.

03:18.160 --> 03:20.845
We bonded over our misery.

03:21.800 --> 03:22.847
There were body shots.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.240
The misery lifted.

03:25.440 --> 03:28.364
- Here. Berries.
- Thank you.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.648
What's got you in such a good mood?

03:30.840 --> 03:35.607
I happened to see a text message pop up
on your phone after you crashed last night.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.848
A warning from your friends.

03:38.040 --> 03:41.647
Silas took the cure. He's a witch.

03:43.120 --> 03:47.125
He's mortal. And now I can kill him.

03:47.320 --> 03:50.642
Get up, gorgeous.
Your doppelganger dies today.

03:50.840 --> 03:53.286
We all know that Tessa
was a real vengeful bitch.

03:53.480 --> 03:55.801
Your doppelganger, Amara,
died at her hands.

03:56.040 --> 04:00.602
But today, after 2000 years,
Amara and I will finally reunite.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.251
All right, skip the mushy parts.

04:02.440 --> 04:05.205
Look, my girl here
is just trying to have a good day.

04:05.400 --> 04:07.482
There are promises
she's expecting you to keep.

04:07.720 --> 04:09.768
Oh, you don't think I keep my promises?

04:09.960 --> 04:12.964
You said now that you're a witch,
you would bring Bonnie back.

04:13.160 --> 04:15.322
- I did and I can.
- And you promised Damon...

04:15.560 --> 04:17.961
- ...that you would do that if he helped you.
- Yeah.

04:18.160 --> 04:20.970
- But you're kind of evil, no offense.
- None taken.

04:21.160 --> 04:24.050
So I'm just trying to figure out
how I can trust...

04:24.280 --> 04:28.365
that one of your last acts in this world
will be to bring my best friend back?

04:28.560 --> 04:30.210
Did you want me to pinky-swear?

04:30.400 --> 04:33.688
She's trying to have a good day.
Just tell her how it's gonna go down.

04:33.880 --> 04:39.011
I just want to destroy the Other Side so I don't
get stuck in purgatory when I kill myself.

04:39.200 --> 04:41.328
Before I do that,
I'll bring Bonnie back.

04:41.520 --> 04:45.366
And being the amazing and incredible
and all-powerful witch that I am...

04:45.560 --> 04:46.846
I can totally do both.

04:47.040 --> 04:50.362
I just have to find the Anchor first
and destroy it.

04:50.600 --> 04:52.011
The Anchor?

04:52.200 --> 04:54.771
Silas is looking for the Anchor.

04:54.960 --> 04:58.123
The object I used to bind the spell
when I created the Other Side.

04:58.320 --> 05:00.527
Destroy it, the spell's broken.

05:00.720 --> 05:02.722
No more supernatural limbo.

05:02.920 --> 05:05.366
Then Silas can die and find peace.

05:05.560 --> 05:09.360
I'd rather his lying, cheating ass
not have that.

05:09.560 --> 05:13.087
Great. Fine. I approve. Where is it?

05:13.480 --> 05:18.805
New Jersey? The supernatural other world is
bound by an object in Snooki's backyard?

05:19.040 --> 05:23.045
It's in a stockyard, and it's being shipped
out, so we really need to...

05:23.680 --> 05:25.250
Hello, hunter.

05:27.200 --> 05:28.565
Banner day for you, huh?

05:28.800 --> 05:31.007
Didn't you and the Bennett
witch used to, uh:

05:32.440 --> 05:34.363
Hey, knock it off. Okay?

05:34.600 --> 05:37.080
It's okay, Jer.
We all want the same thing today.

05:37.880 --> 05:39.723
Silas dead, Bonnie alive.

05:39.920 --> 05:43.845
A.k.a. put the damn crossbow down,
Pocahontas.

05:44.040 --> 05:47.761
We're to believe he's gonna bring Bonnie
back out of the goodness of his heart?

05:47.960 --> 05:51.248
I hope not.
I mean, I am kind of a monster.

05:53.120 --> 05:56.602
You know, guys, I'm feeling really
ganged up on right now.

05:56.800 --> 06:00.247
Okay? I would hate to lose my temper
and do something...

06:01.080 --> 06:02.127
crazy.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.766
Ah. Man, I really love being a witch again.

06:13.960 --> 06:17.043
I feel like I'm constantly
reinventing myself.

06:17.240 --> 06:21.040
I'm like a supernatural Madonna,
don't you think?

06:21.240 --> 06:25.404
So Silas read your mind and figured out
where the Anchor is.

06:25.600 --> 06:28.683
- Now what?
- You know that story about the Travelers?

06:29.520 --> 06:32.808
Wait, you don't. I fried your brain
and took your memories. Sorry.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.331
Well, the Travelers...

06:34.520 --> 06:38.047
You know how Silas wants to destroy
the Other Side so he can be at peace...

06:38.240 --> 06:40.925
with that slut Amara
that he calls his one true love?

06:41.120 --> 06:42.770
The Travelers don't want that.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.650
- Why not?
- Not important.

06:45.680 --> 06:48.365
Scratch that. Very important,
I'm just not gonna answer it.

06:50.040 --> 06:55.649
Um, you know what? I think I still
need to be drunk to understand this story.

06:55.840 --> 07:00.528
The Travelers have been in possession
of the Anchor for 2000 years.

07:00.720 --> 07:03.644
They constantly move it
so it doesn't fall into the wrong hands.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.161
And they're not gonna let him get near it.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.323
At least not before I kill him.

07:08.520 --> 07:09.851
Well, what if they fail?

07:10.040 --> 07:12.771
He won't destroy it.
He won't be able to.

07:12.960 --> 07:14.803
Why not?

07:15.000 --> 07:18.527
Let's just file that under
the "not gonna answer it" category.

07:18.720 --> 07:22.964
All right, we gotta get going. You,
grab a crowbar or four from the garage.

07:23.160 --> 07:24.650
- What for?
- Does it matter?

07:24.880 --> 07:27.690
You. You're not going. Men only.

07:27.920 --> 07:30.890
- Are you serious? He's not serious.
- No, he's not serious.

07:31.080 --> 07:32.889
Actually, I'm 100 percent serious.

07:33.080 --> 07:35.367
She's the carbon copy
of my true love Amara.

07:35.600 --> 07:39.002
You understand why I don't want
to stare at her imposter face all day.

07:39.200 --> 07:40.565
That makes no sense.

07:40.760 --> 07:45.084
It would make sense if you were ever in love
with anybody who looked exactly like her.

07:46.080 --> 07:49.448
This is ridiculous. We're bringing
my best friend back from the dead.

07:49.640 --> 07:51.608
- I'm going.
- Ugh.

07:54.680 --> 07:56.444
<i>Hey-</i>

07:59.120 --> 08:00.690
Next one goes in the heart. Hurry.

08:00.880 --> 08:04.407
I only have until sundown
before Tessa tries to stop me.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.448
The one good thing about having amnesia...

08:08.640 --> 08:11.484
is I don't remember
how I got in the middle of all this.

08:11.680 --> 08:13.489
- Ha, ha.
- Mm.

08:13.720 --> 08:16.485
Rest easy, sweet pea.

08:16.720 --> 08:18.370
Don't you worry about the details.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.682
Silas is going to die today.

08:20.880 --> 08:23.281
And he will spend eternity
on the Other Side...

08:23.520 --> 08:28.003
as far away from Amara,
and peace, as possible.

08:28.200 --> 08:29.770
I have it all covered.

08:29.960 --> 08:34.409
You don't scheme as long as I have
without considering every possibility.

08:39.159 --> 08:40.969
What's wrong?

08:45.480 --> 08:48.290
Silas put a spell on this cabin.

08:48.480 --> 08:50.164
We're stuck here until sundown.

08:51.400 --> 08:52.447
How do you know that?

08:53.800 --> 08:55.962
Because I taught him the damn spell.

09:10.840 --> 09:14.765
I don't want to know if Tyler called,
so don't even tell me.

09:15.840 --> 09:18.571
Do you wanna do
small appliances or toiletries?

09:18.760 --> 09:24.005
I'd compel a cute boy to pack for us, but I
don't think I wanna see a cute boy ever again.

09:24.200 --> 09:27.682
Except for Jesse
who's conveniently not answering his phone.

09:28.680 --> 09:31.126
Um, we're moving out?

09:31.320 --> 09:33.641
Hello? Dr. Maxfield thinks we're vampires.

09:33.880 --> 09:37.487
Threatened to expose us.
Told us to drop out.

09:37.720 --> 09:39.051
That sucks.

09:45.720 --> 09:48.087
What the hell are you doing
in my dorm, Katherine?

09:48.280 --> 09:50.009
I just need a place to crash.

09:50.200 --> 09:53.443
- What? I loathe you.
- I'm desperate, okay?

09:53.640 --> 09:56.166
Damon kicked me out.
Stefan doesn't remember me.

09:56.400 --> 10:00.086
I just spent my last $20
on a meal that I didn't even get to enjoy.

10:00.320 --> 10:02.402
Aw. How is any of this my problem?

10:02.960 --> 10:04.121
Look at you.

10:05.560 --> 10:08.609
Moving out? Giving up?

10:08.800 --> 10:11.451
That's very un-Caroline of you.

10:12.600 --> 10:14.807
You need me, bad.

10:21.320 --> 10:25.041
In exchange for a place to stay
and Elena's meal card...

10:25.240 --> 10:29.962
I will help you deal with Dr. Whoever.

10:30.160 --> 10:32.686
Dr. Maxfield. He teaches bio.

10:32.880 --> 10:35.770
Heh. I'm sorry, what?
You're scared of a teacher?

10:36.360 --> 10:40.570
Oh, honey, you really need
to take a crash course on Villain 101.

10:40.760 --> 10:43.923
Luckily for you,
I have an honorary doctorate.

10:45.600 --> 10:46.965
What do you say, roomie?

10:55.200 --> 10:57.120
- Stefan's phone.
- Who's this?

10:57.240 --> 11:01.529
Uncanny. Your doppelganger voice
is exactly like Amara's.

11:01.760 --> 11:02.921
So whiny.

11:03.120 --> 11:07.205
- Tessa. Where's Stefan?
- He's here. Well, not "here" here.

11:07.400 --> 11:11.610
He hopped in the shower. Between us girls,
he works up quite the sweat.

11:11.800 --> 11:14.724
<i>But I guess you know that.
May I leave him a message?</i>

11:14.920 --> 11:18.288
Yeah. Remind him
that you're a crazy bitch.

11:18.480 --> 11:21.006
I would, but I think that's maybe his type.

11:26.480 --> 11:29.484
He's with Tessa.
Why does he keep going back to her?

11:29.680 --> 11:32.490
Look, who knows?
Amnesia-Stef is a fickle little...

11:32.680 --> 11:35.650
Wait. You didn't tell Elena
what you did to Stefan?

11:36.920 --> 11:38.206
Tell me what?

11:40.720 --> 11:43.371
Silas needed his psychic juju
to get into Tessa's head.

11:43.560 --> 11:47.485
The only way to temporarily reactivate
his abilities was to break Stefan's neck...

11:48.480 --> 11:51.768
- ...a couple times.
- As if he didn't hate us enough.

11:51.960 --> 11:55.965
- Damon, I'm going over there.
- She should, really.

11:56.160 --> 11:58.128
- Tessa's bad business.
- No.

11:58.360 --> 11:59.964
Just let Stefan have his space.

12:00.160 --> 12:02.242
Just like you said,
he's already mad enough.

12:02.440 --> 12:04.204
Sounds like he's more mad at you.

12:04.400 --> 12:07.802
Maybe he and I can find
some common ground.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.047
Knock-knock.

12:15.520 --> 12:19.684
Knock-knock. Who's there?
The mayor. The mayor who?

12:22.520 --> 12:24.045
Well, who?

12:24.240 --> 12:27.608
No one. That's the joke.
No one's there because I killed the mayor.

12:27.800 --> 12:30.280
<i>And I still got something to say</i>

12:30.480 --> 12:31.561
You're a dick.

12:31.760 --> 12:36.607
Subject 62547. Blood film analysis.

12:46.760 --> 12:50.606
Cellular growth rate is phenomenal,
as expected.

13:11.320 --> 13:12.446
What are you doing here?

13:21.240 --> 13:23.846
Well, if it isn't Stefan's fated love.

13:24.040 --> 13:25.087
Where is he?

13:25.320 --> 13:28.642
Come on in.
Who am I to stand in the way of destiny?

13:35.080 --> 13:38.926
Elena, you shouldn't have walked
through that door.

13:39.120 --> 13:43.444
I'm really sorry. I wouldn't have
let Damon do what he did to you...

13:43.640 --> 13:45.404
Sure you would have.

13:45.600 --> 13:48.604
You have this annoying tendency
to do anything he tells you.

13:49.960 --> 13:52.691
I'm no shrink,
but I think it's called co-dependence.

13:53.800 --> 13:58.601
Look, I get that you're upset with us
for pretty much everything.

13:58.800 --> 14:04.045
But do you really think that sleeping
with Tessa is gonna solve anything?

14:06.320 --> 14:08.527
Who said I was sleeping with Tessa?

14:12.440 --> 14:14.488
I am so bad with messages.

14:15.360 --> 14:19.046
Oh, look. Elena called.
She's wondering why you're here.

14:19.240 --> 14:22.289
I may have embellished for effect.

14:22.480 --> 14:23.641
Okay.

14:23.880 --> 14:28.044
I just came by <i>to</i> make sure she hadn't done
some Fatal Attraction spell on you.

14:28.240 --> 14:32.325
But now that I know that you're good,
I'm gonna go.

14:44.120 --> 14:47.203
Yeah,
you really shouldn't have come inside.

15:00.520 --> 15:02.602
Thank God.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.321
How do you do it, Damon?

15:06.520 --> 15:09.364
How can you stand being here
while your girlfriend's at home...

15:09.560 --> 15:11.688
worrying about her
doppelganger soul mate?

15:11.880 --> 15:16.408
It's called being secure. I'm assuming you
know about that by the way you wear your hair.

15:16.640 --> 15:19.610
Don't tell me you believe in
this doppelganger prophecy crap.

15:19.800 --> 15:21.689
Crap? What do you mean crap?

15:21.880 --> 15:25.202
Do you not notice the universe
trying to mirror my love for Amara...

15:25.440 --> 15:27.602
by bringing our doppelgangers together?

15:27.800 --> 15:30.371
You do realize that
by destroying the Other Side...

15:30.560 --> 15:33.803
you are personally moving
heaven and earth to be together.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.604
That's not fate, you idiot.

15:35.800 --> 15:37.404
It's you being a crazy person.

15:45.960 --> 15:48.566
Okay. Where is this stupid Anchor thing?

15:48.800 --> 15:50.245
I have no idea.

15:50.440 --> 15:53.603
- What do you mean you have no idea?
- Give me some credit, man.

15:53.840 --> 15:57.925
I did psychically dive into Tessa's mind
to see this specific warehouse.

15:58.120 --> 16:00.885
- What does it look like?
- Again, I have no idea.

16:01.080 --> 16:04.402
Tessa created it after she locked me away
in a tomb for 2000 years...

16:04.600 --> 16:09.083
and left me to starve. Remember?
Remote island, creepy hallucinations?

16:09.320 --> 16:11.926
Wait, you don't know where it is
or what it looks like?

16:12.120 --> 16:14.600
It binds the spell
to a supernatural hell dimension.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.689
It's not gonna look like an IKEA sink.

16:22.160 --> 16:23.889
What did you inject him with?

16:24.120 --> 16:26.930
I don't know.
It just said "avoid contact with eyes."

16:27.120 --> 16:28.884
And "do not ingest."

16:30.440 --> 16:32.408
- it's etorphine.
- There you go.

16:32.600 --> 16:33.965
What are you doing, Elena?

16:34.160 --> 16:35.810
Draining your vervained blood...

16:36.000 --> 16:38.651
so I can compel you to forget
Elena and I are vampires.

16:38.840 --> 16:42.890
- Wait, what? You'll kill me...
- Shh. I'm trying to do some math. Okay.

16:43.080 --> 16:46.766
So if the average male has
five liters of blood in his system...

16:46.960 --> 16:49.247
- That's not right.
- Then carry the one.

16:49.480 --> 16:53.121
- Just round up.
- Perfect, four-point-seven pints.

16:54.480 --> 16:58.166
- Use the right or left arm?
- Untie me. I'll find the vein. You'll kill me.

16:59.120 --> 17:00.963
Give me. It's not my first rodeo.

17:02.240 --> 17:05.164
Could you get me one of those tube-y things
and, uh, tape?

17:19.160 --> 17:21.685
Oh, my God. It's totally working.

17:22.560 --> 17:23.800
Ta-da.

17:26.520 --> 17:28.682
So...

17:31.520 --> 17:33.010
doctor...

17:34.200 --> 17:37.841
you tell me, who else knows about us?

17:39.000 --> 17:43.210
If you were willing to kill me, you wouldn't
have gone through all this trouble.

17:43.400 --> 17:45.368
You should've left when I told you to.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.680
- They're onto you.
- Who's "they"?

17:49.920 --> 17:54.562
The people you want to expose us to? That
secret society thing-y that you belong to?

17:54.800 --> 17:56.962
There's a gathering today
at Whitmore House.

17:57.160 --> 18:00.846
The society's using it
to suss out potential candidates.

18:01.040 --> 18:04.931
They were going to invite you until they
started suspecting you were a vampire.

18:06.360 --> 18:10.046
So all I have to do is convince them
that Elena Gilbert isn't a vampire?

18:10.240 --> 18:12.561
Heh. Done.

18:13.880 --> 18:17.407
They'll never let you in. A vampire
can never get past the threshold.

18:28.080 --> 18:29.684
What did that crate do to you?

18:29.920 --> 18:31.763
Bonnie. What are you doing here?

18:32.000 --> 18:33.684
Didn't wanna miss the excitement.

18:33.920 --> 18:36.048
Not every day a girl
comes back from the dead.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.366
Don't jinx it.

18:37.560 --> 18:42.646
I'm not jinxing it, I'm being realistic.
It's not a dime-store spell, Jer.

18:42.840 --> 18:45.764
When I brought you back it killed me,
remember?

18:47.240 --> 18:51.131
What I meant was it's just not something
I'm going to count on, okay?

18:51.320 --> 18:54.529
Not okay. Have some faith.

18:54.720 --> 19:00.250
If you believe that it can work, and I
believe it can work, then it will work.

19:00.440 --> 19:04.729
Just say it. You need to say it.

19:06.600 --> 19:10.161
- It will work.
- Heh. Thank you.

19:12.440 --> 19:15.125
Jer, just so we're clear...

19:16.240 --> 19:22.486
I would die 100 times over to have you
standing here alive in front of me.

19:25.440 --> 19:27.442
Before today is over...

19:30.360 --> 19:36.049
we're going to know what
that feels like.

19:38.960 --> 19:40.405
<i>Heh.</i>

19:46.640 --> 19:50.440
Quit dawdling. We need to find this thing
before the Travelers show up.

19:50.640 --> 19:52.449
Why are they interested in this Anchor?

19:52.640 --> 19:55.086
They hate me
for creating the immortality spell.

19:55.280 --> 19:59.205
They know the Anchor's the only thing
standing between me and my soul mate.

19:59.400 --> 20:04.327
And every love story needs that one thing
that just keeps getting in the way.

20:05.360 --> 20:06.691
Kind of like you, Damon.

20:08.480 --> 20:11.609
You might be an all-powerful witch,
is that what you called it?

20:11.800 --> 20:15.282
- Yeah.
- But I will happily kill you if you keep that up.

20:15.520 --> 20:19.047
Oh, no, you won't. Not until I bring your
girlfriend's bestie back.

20:25.200 --> 20:28.170
- Isn't this a pleasant surprise.
- You ain't seen nothing yet.

20:28.360 --> 20:33.127
Since I'm occupied at the moment, I need
you to go ahead and kill Silas for me.

20:34.400 --> 20:38.689
Gladly, but he's such a control freak
that he wants to off himself himself.

20:38.920 --> 20:41.764
After he destroys the Other Side?
That's not gonna happen.

20:41.960 --> 20:45.328
Plus, I want him dead before he has
the pleasure of finding the Anchor.

20:45.520 --> 20:48.205
- Yeah, I'm not following.
- Kill him, now.

20:48.400 --> 20:51.165
- Damon...
- Did I mention I lured your girlfriend to me?

20:51.360 --> 20:54.842
I used the oldest trick in the book.
Jealousy. Of Stefan.

20:55.040 --> 20:56.121
<i>Thought you should know.</i>

20:59.400 --> 21:02.768
- Aah!
- Tessa!

21:03.120 --> 21:04.360
Just stop. Stop it!

21:08.560 --> 21:11.211
I can't kill him yet.
He has to do something for me first.

21:11.400 --> 21:14.529
Is that something more important
than Elena?

21:14.720 --> 21:17.769
Because Silas put a spell on this house
and bound it to the sun...

21:18.000 --> 21:20.401
which means we're trapped here
until sundown.

21:20.600 --> 21:25.401
Which means you have until then
to kill Silas or I kill Elena.

21:27.400 --> 21:30.449
With a face like Amara's,
it might be cathartic.

21:30.680 --> 21:33.206
<i>- Bye, now.
- Wait.</i>

22:07.080 --> 22:09.560
- Ms. Gilbert.
- You know me?

22:09.800 --> 22:12.963
I'm Diane Freeman.
We met the night your roommate died.

22:13.440 --> 22:14.965
Of course.

22:15.160 --> 22:18.767
Crazy night.
Anyway, I am here for the shindig.

22:19.120 --> 22:21.771
I didn't realize you'd be joining us.

22:21.960 --> 22:23.928
Did I forget to RSVP?

22:24.960 --> 22:28.931
Sorry,
I've just been so busy with my studies.

22:29.760 --> 22:31.922
We just started the tea.

22:39.840 --> 22:41.490
Got any food?

23:04.120 --> 23:05.690
What?

23:07.480 --> 23:08.970
Are you the sandwich police?

23:11.080 --> 23:15.005
Just, uh, trying to figure out
why Wes told me to stay away from you.

23:16.600 --> 23:18.523
- Do I know you?
- Aaron.

23:19.040 --> 23:21.646
We met yesterday.
You changed your hair. it's...

23:21.840 --> 23:24.605
Aaron. Duh. Hi.

23:27.360 --> 23:29.169
So, what are you doing here?

23:29.360 --> 23:33.285
Are you part of the secret society?

23:33.480 --> 23:34.527
The what?

23:35.240 --> 23:36.810
You know.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.207
The society.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.649
I still have no idea.

23:44.520 --> 23:48.650
Either you're genuinely clueless
or you're very good at keeping secrets.

24:03.200 --> 24:06.522
- Is that your tooth?
- No.

24:08.520 --> 24:10.568
What is happening to me?

24:12.080 --> 24:14.162
- Is that your tooth? Are you...?
- Ahem.

24:20.400 --> 24:24.371
Look at all the incredible things
they've dreamt up to do with food.

24:24.600 --> 24:27.080
- Pineapple on pizza? Mm.
- Heh.

24:30.560 --> 24:33.211
So sad. Let me guess. Gluten-free?

24:33.400 --> 24:34.526
How did you get here?

24:34.720 --> 24:37.246
- Excuse me?
- Here. Alive. From the Other Side.

24:37.440 --> 24:39.010
How did you come back to life?

24:39.240 --> 24:42.483
Oh, yeah, that.
You can blame your friend Bonnie for that.

24:42.680 --> 24:46.526
She opened the door, distracted herself
when she brought your brother back to life.

24:46.720 --> 24:50.281
So I just walked right through
when she died.

24:50.480 --> 24:55.725
Well, today, Silas was going to bring her
back to life after he got the Anchor.

24:55.920 --> 24:59.811
But you told my boyfriend, who has
never put anyone's life before mine...

25:00.600 --> 25:04.969
including his own,
to kill Silas before he could do that.

25:06.320 --> 25:10.484
So no, I'm not sad about the pizza.

25:14.360 --> 25:17.045
Look, why don't we forget about the pizza?

25:17.280 --> 25:20.727
What do you say I make something?

25:20.920 --> 25:22.763
- Okay.
- Heh.

25:24.120 --> 25:26.122
- Roasted duck?
- Oh.

25:26.320 --> 25:29.802
- Wait. Do you have a duck?
- Oh... No.

25:30.040 --> 25:32.122
But maybe I could lure one inside.

25:32.320 --> 25:33.924
I got Elena in.

25:34.120 --> 25:36.088
How much smarter could a duck be?

25:42.000 --> 25:44.446
- Go for it.
- All right.

25:44.680 --> 25:46.250
We can't kill Silas.

25:46.480 --> 25:48.687
Silas is the only one
that can bring Bonnie back.

25:48.880 --> 25:52.123
And he's not going to until right
before he destroys the Other Side.

25:52.360 --> 25:56.490
Tessa wants to do it now. Something tells
me patience isn't her strong suit.

25:56.680 --> 26:00.605
Damon, you promised. You promised Elena
that she would see Bonnie again.

26:00.800 --> 26:02.450
You don't think I'm aware of that?

26:02.640 --> 26:07.806
But if Tessa kills Elena, guess who's not
gonna make it to Bonnie's welcome-home party.

26:08.680 --> 26:10.762
Plan's off, Jeremy.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.002
Bonnie's not coming back.

26:13.560 --> 26:15.050
Sorry.

26:19.480 --> 26:21.926
It's okay, Jeremy.

26:26.840 --> 26:29.969
Bonnie, she's my sister.

26:30.160 --> 26:33.130
Jeremy Gilbert.
Do you not know me at all?

26:33.360 --> 26:36.762
Is there a part of you that thinks for
one minute I'd let my friends die...

26:36.960 --> 26:38.849
just so I could come back to life?

26:39.360 --> 26:41.328
I'm dead, Jer.

26:41.800 --> 26:43.723
And as much as I want to come back...

26:45.360 --> 26:47.681
maybe I'm just supposed to accept that.

26:51.400 --> 26:52.811
We were so close.

26:53.040 --> 26:54.405
I know we were.

26:57.880 --> 27:00.247
Now go help him kill Silas.

27:25.680 --> 27:30.607
I've met a lot of witches in my day,
never quite heard that one before.

27:35.120 --> 27:37.407
Let me guess. Travelers.

27:58.320 --> 28:00.721
Why do witches
always go for the daylight ring?

28:02.680 --> 28:05.923
I was about to do your Euro-tribe
a favor. I want to kill Silas too.

28:06.160 --> 28:07.286
That's the problem.

28:07.480 --> 28:10.563
- We don't want him dead yet.
- Well, that's not gonna work for me.

28:21.160 --> 28:22.571
You're oddly calm.

28:22.800 --> 28:26.282
Which only adds
to my complete and utter terror.

28:26.480 --> 28:28.050
Sorry. I spaced.

28:28.240 --> 28:29.890
You spaced?

28:30.080 --> 28:31.730
Caroline, I would've bled to death.

28:31.920 --> 28:34.605
Know what?
I just broke up with my boyfriend.

28:34.800 --> 28:35.881
<i>For good.</i>

28:36.080 --> 28:37.889
My heart is in pieces.

28:38.080 --> 28:39.764
Sue me for having a moment.

28:39.960 --> 28:41.883
My apologies. ls the moment over?

28:42.080 --> 28:43.764
Yes, it is.

28:43.960 --> 28:46.042
Now, answer my questions truthfully.

28:46.280 --> 28:47.770
What is the secret society?

28:48.800 --> 28:50.723
- It's called Augustine.
- Augustine?

28:50.920 --> 28:53.526
- I've never heard of it.
- Well, that's the whole point.

28:53.720 --> 28:56.564
- How do you become a member?
- Most recruits are legacies.

28:56.760 --> 28:59.081
But some were chosen
for our extraordinary talents.

28:59.280 --> 29:01.567
And what is your extraordinary talent?

29:01.800 --> 29:03.245
Being brilliant.

29:03.440 --> 29:07.843
Not to mention that you're willing to lie
on autopsy reports. Like my roommate's.

29:08.040 --> 29:11.487
You knew she was killed by a vampire.
Is that why you covered up her death?

29:11.720 --> 29:14.803
No. I covered up her death
because it wasn't just any vampire.

29:16.040 --> 29:17.724
It was the Augustine vampire.

29:18.160 --> 29:20.561
Wha...? Hang on.

29:20.760 --> 29:26.927
Okay, so your creepy elitist society
also has their own vampire?

29:27.160 --> 29:28.207
Who is it?

29:29.480 --> 29:32.086
Wes, you in there? It's Diane Freeman.

29:32.560 --> 29:35.291
You were wrong.
Elena Gilbert and I aren't vampires.

29:35.480 --> 29:39.451
We're just regular freshman. You're lightheaded
because you gave blood this morning.

29:39.640 --> 29:42.041
Forget everything that happened here.

29:43.160 --> 29:44.924
Wes?

29:46.280 --> 29:49.727
- So you are here.
- Of course I'm here. Why?

29:49.920 --> 29:52.730
Because it's 5:00.
You missed the Whitmore party.

29:52.920 --> 29:54.331
What?

29:55.320 --> 29:57.163
I was working.

29:58.360 --> 30:00.169
The day must've gotten away from me.

30:00.400 --> 30:05.566
That's not all you missed. Guess who I
watched strut right through the front door.

30:05.760 --> 30:08.366
Elena Gilbert, clearly not a vampire.

30:09.320 --> 30:11.209
What made you so convinced she was?

30:12.080 --> 30:16.324
I have no idea.

30:17.680 --> 30:19.682
Guess I was wrong.

30:20.880 --> 30:24.327
- Try this and let me know what you think.
- Okay.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.530
All right.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.883
- Mm. It's good.
- Yeah?

30:30.080 --> 30:32.287
- Yeah.
- All right.

30:35.640 --> 30:39.565
Okay, I get it. You hate me.

30:40.720 --> 30:43.087
You may not have any memories, Stefan,
but I do.

30:43.280 --> 30:46.966
This person, she's not the type of person
that you would like.

30:48.760 --> 30:55.564
That's not very nice, especially considering
I've allowed you to remain alive until sundown.

30:56.480 --> 30:59.723
Oh. Almost sundown.

31:08.920 --> 31:11.924
Elena. Don't say a word.

31:12.840 --> 31:14.001
I got this.

31:15.240 --> 31:20.451
I know you think that I hate you, but I don't.
I won't let her hurt you. I promise.

31:23.080 --> 31:24.491
Why isn't he picking up?

31:24.680 --> 31:26.728
- What?
- Is he dead yet?

31:26.920 --> 31:29.161
There you are. Man up, we're under attack.

31:29.400 --> 31:33.246
No, he's not dead yet. I was just ambushed
by some of your inbred cousins.

31:33.440 --> 31:37.331
Any idea why Travelers who hate Silas
would wanna stop me from killing him?

31:37.520 --> 31:39.568
- They probably want his blood.
- For what?

31:39.760 --> 31:43.003
Silas drank the cure from Katherine.
Now his blood is the cure.

31:43.200 --> 31:45.851
But they're not immortal.
So who do they want it for?

31:46.040 --> 31:47.166
Think about it, Damon.

31:47.360 --> 31:50.125
The Travelers aren't fans of immortality.

31:50.320 --> 31:55.611
And I had to bind the Other Side to something.
Something that would last forever.

31:55.800 --> 31:58.326
<i>Something that Silas couldn't destroy.</i>

31:58.560 --> 32:00.324
<i>DAMON'.
What, his favorite childhood sled?</i>

32:00.560 --> 32:03.086
<i>Something a little closer to his heart.</i>

32:03.280 --> 32:06.090
Two thousand years old. Immortal.

32:06.280 --> 32:08.009
Indestructible.

32:08.200 --> 32:11.443
You're a quick boy, Damon, figure it out.

32:17.920 --> 32:19.331
Elena, run!

32:29.360 --> 32:31.283
- No way.
- What?

32:31.480 --> 32:33.289
Not possible.

32:33.480 --> 32:34.720
What?

32:34.920 --> 32:37.651
<i>DAMON'. Tessa may be insane,
but she's a bona fide genius.</i>

32:37.840 --> 32:40.571
<i>Two thousand years old? Immortal?
Indestructible?</i>

32:40.760 --> 32:44.446
The anchor isn't a thing, it's a person.

32:50.120 --> 32:51.167
Amara.

32:52.760 --> 32:55.081
She never killed Amara.

32:57.360 --> 32:59.203
You're still alive.

33:40.040 --> 33:41.246
Amara.

33:42.400 --> 33:44.164
It's me.

33:50.760 --> 33:52.683
- You're okay.
- Go away. Go away. Go away.

33:52.920 --> 33:54.684
- Leave me alone.
- No, no, no, it's okay.

33:54.920 --> 33:58.402
Who are you talking to? It's me. It's me.

33:58.800 --> 34:00.529
Silas.

34:00.760 --> 34:03.047
- It's me.
- How is it possible?

34:03.240 --> 34:06.961
How are you here, after all this time?

34:07.520 --> 34:09.887
I thought you were dead.

34:10.080 --> 34:14.085
Tessa said she killed you.
She held your heart in her hands.

34:14.320 --> 34:17.880
She lied. She couldn't kill me.
There was only one cure.

34:18.080 --> 34:19.809
She wanted it for you.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.641
I took it. I'm sorry.

34:23.840 --> 34:26.922
I wanted to be with you,
I wanted to be at peace with you.

34:27.480 --> 34:29.130
The cure runs in your veins?

34:31.239 --> 34:32.889
I was ready to die for you.

34:41.040 --> 34:43.281
I love you, Silas.

34:46.560 --> 34:47.891
I'm so sorry.

34:49.040 --> 34:50.849
But I have to be cured.

35:00.840 --> 35:03.571
I can't live another day.

35:19.640 --> 35:22.689
Elena Gilbert. What brings you by?

35:24.080 --> 35:26.606
- How'd you get this?
- Mystery.

35:26.800 --> 35:30.407
I listened to about half before I
nearly blew my brains out from boredom.

35:31.080 --> 35:35.290
Except for the part about your
subject's blood being abnormal.

35:35.520 --> 35:37.124
That part was mildly interesting.

35:37.360 --> 35:38.964
Well, thanks for returning it.

35:39.160 --> 35:42.323
Now, that subject, 62547, right?

35:42.520 --> 35:44.488
Is that the Augustine vampire?

35:45.880 --> 35:48.042
- I think you should go.
- Heh.

35:48.240 --> 35:52.609
And do what? Sprinkle all of your
dirty little secrets across campus?

35:54.000 --> 35:55.365
Like Augustine?

35:55.560 --> 35:58.166
And all the vampire experiments
that you've been doing?

35:58.360 --> 36:02.888
Come on, Dr. Wes. Aren't you
supposed to be some sort of genius?

36:03.480 --> 36:08.168
I'm sure we can come up with some creative
solution for our little predicament.

36:08.640 --> 36:12.531
I have to say, if I wasn't such a genius...

36:12.720 --> 36:15.530
I might actually think
you were blackmailing me, Elena.

36:15.720 --> 36:18.644
Actually, my name's Katherine.
Elena's my doppelganger.

36:18.840 --> 36:21.320
And while I let you chew on that, unh...

36:22.800 --> 36:29.410
I'll admit there is something
that I can't solve on my own.

36:29.920 --> 36:32.207
- Is that a tooth?
- It's my tooth.

36:32.720 --> 36:35.530
I think I'm dying,
and I need you to save my life.

36:43.240 --> 36:45.208
Stop talking.

36:46.160 --> 36:47.525
It's not up to you.

36:48.920 --> 36:50.001
Leave me alone!

36:50.200 --> 36:53.044
Leave me alone, leave me alone,
leave me alone.

36:53.400 --> 36:54.731
Leave me alone!

36:56.280 --> 36:59.841
Please leave me alone.
Leave me alone.

37:06.280 --> 37:07.770
Are you real?

37:08.480 --> 37:10.369
Are you?

37:18.920 --> 37:22.925
Well, uh, have a good night.

37:23.280 --> 37:24.850
Yeah.

37:26.480 --> 37:28.209
It's weird.

37:28.640 --> 37:32.531
Even with no memory, you're still you.

37:32.720 --> 37:37.965
Well, Tessa was going to kill you.
And you don't seem like you deserve that.

37:38.160 --> 37:41.209
So I was just going on instinct.
That's all.

37:41.440 --> 37:42.680
Exactly.

37:42.880 --> 37:44.644
That's what I'm saying.

37:45.640 --> 37:48.484
Your instincts were always to protect me.

37:48.680 --> 37:54.084
So thank you for just being you.

37:54.280 --> 37:59.047
<i>I think I'm comin' down</i>

37:59.240 --> 38:00.605
Have a good night.

38:04.800 --> 38:08.885
Stefan Salvatore sleeps in his own bed tonight.
Does that mean he stopped hating us?

38:09.080 --> 38:12.926
Or did the power of the doppelganger
universe push him into the car with you?

38:13.120 --> 38:19.287
Well, he, uh, saved my life,
so I'll take that as not-hate.

38:19.520 --> 38:23.161
Victory in a day otherwise
marred by failure.

38:27.160 --> 38:29.925
We couldn't get Bonnie back. I get a pass.

38:30.840 --> 38:34.481
- Did I say anything?
- Tell her it's for the best, Jer.

38:34.680 --> 38:38.765
No. No, I won't. Because it's not.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.570
What?

38:40.760 --> 38:42.285
Bonnie's here.

38:44.280 --> 38:46.647
She wants us not to worry.

38:46.880 --> 38:50.601
We're gonna keep trying, Bonnie. Okay?
It's not over.

38:50.880 --> 38:55.920
- We've dealt with much worse.
- Well, Silas is MIA and out and about.

38:56.120 --> 38:57.167
Which is pretty bad.

38:57.360 --> 39:01.490
And Amara has been cured,
which is even worse...

39:01.680 --> 39:03.808
because now she's easy to kill.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.924
So the fate of the Other Side,
where Bonnie currently resides...

39:07.120 --> 39:12.411
rests on a living, breathing human being
that we now need to protect.

39:13.960 --> 39:16.645
We need to protect?

39:21.920 --> 39:24.366
Elena, meet Crazy Pants.

39:25.160 --> 39:27.367
Crazy Pants, meet Elena.

39:36.640 --> 39:37.687
What are you doing here?

39:37.880 --> 39:41.487
Do you have any idea what it's like
watching history repeat itself?

39:41.680 --> 39:43.205
You're hurt.

39:43.440 --> 39:46.489
- I can heal you.
- No. No.

39:46.680 --> 39:50.127
I want this wound.
It's a reminder of what you really are.

39:50.360 --> 39:53.364
See, memories are important.

39:54.200 --> 39:56.487
I made a mistake when I found you.

39:57.800 --> 39:59.848
I eased your pain.

40:01.440 --> 40:03.647
You used to have a lot of pain.

40:03.840 --> 40:05.569
Remember?

40:14.840 --> 40:21.200
You killed your own father, and then forced
your brother to become a vampire.

40:22.360 --> 40:23.566
<i>Don't fight it.</i>

40:23.760 --> 40:25.762
That was just the start
of your reign of terror.

40:25.960 --> 40:29.726
You hated yourself for a century.
But then you found her.

40:29.920 --> 40:31.410
- I'm Elena.
- I'm Stefan.

40:31.600 --> 40:35.161
- Didn't last very long, did it?
- Stop it. Stop it, please.

40:35.360 --> 40:37.044
But the ending's the best part.

40:37.800 --> 40:39.689
Because you actually felt real pain.

40:39.880 --> 40:42.201
Physical pain. Torture. Remember?

40:42.400 --> 40:43.845
<i>Hello, my shadow self.</i>

40:44.560 --> 40:47.928
<i>You were trapped in the safe.
Tossed in the quarry.</i>

40:48.760 --> 40:52.446
Water flooded in. You tried to scream,
you tried to escape.

40:52.640 --> 40:59.489
But all you could do was drown.
Over. And over. And over again.

41:01.440 --> 41:05.047
The only thing keeping you sane
was the hope that one day...

41:05.240 --> 41:08.005
one of the two people you loved...

41:09.000 --> 41:10.206
they'd come rescue you.

41:10.800 --> 41:13.121
But they didn't. I did.

41:16.440 --> 41:18.283
Always remember that.
