WEBVTT

00:01.126 --> 00:02.543
Previously on "The 100"...

00:02.753 --> 00:04.671
Before the last war,
Mount Weather

00:04.880 --> 00:06.589
was a military base
built within a Mountain.

00:07.800 --> 00:09.133
Welcome to Mount Weather.

00:09.343 --> 00:11.636
You're not prisoners.
We saved you.

00:11.845 --> 00:12.762
Then why would
we want to leave?

00:12.972 --> 00:14.764
This place is
too good to be true.

00:14.974 --> 00:17.350
Reapers!

00:17.559 --> 00:18.685
Octavia!

00:18.894 --> 00:19.978
Where's Lincoln?

00:20.187 --> 00:22.522
Mark this one for
the Cerberus program.

00:22.731 --> 00:24.774
They'll kill him.
We have to do something.

00:24.984 --> 00:26.651
Our friends
are out there

00:26.860 --> 00:28.403
and you need
to go get them.

00:28.612 --> 00:30.905
Where is the girl who
was wearing this watch?!

00:32.366 --> 00:33.574
Let's get moving.

00:33.784 --> 00:35.326
We'll search high and low
for the kids.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.078
I'm leading a mission
to bring them back.

00:37.287 --> 00:38.454
I'm taking the grounder
prisoner with me to guide the way.

00:38.664 --> 00:39.956
I'm gonna get you
out of here.

00:40.124 --> 00:41.749
Our only chance is if
we fight together.

00:41.959 --> 00:42.750
I know my people will help.

00:43.919 --> 00:44.711
Aah!

00:44.920 --> 00:45.712
Oh, no, no, no.

00:45.921 --> 00:49.132
Aah!

00:49.341 --> 00:50.466
Weapons...

00:53.053 --> 00:55.221
Secure the perimeter!
Teams of 3!

00:55.431 --> 00:56.806
100-yard buffer!

00:57.016 --> 00:58.099
Open the gate!

01:01.437 --> 01:02.687
How many of you
are there?

01:04.815 --> 01:07.108
Let's go!

01:24.626 --> 01:25.752
Wait.

01:25.961 --> 01:27.211
Once the prisoner
is secured.

01:27.421 --> 01:30.590
She's not a prisoner.
She's my daughter.

01:35.429 --> 01:36.471
Clarke.

01:44.188 --> 01:45.354
Mom?

02:22.309 --> 02:24.018
I need saline and
a pressure dressing.

02:24.228 --> 02:25.812
- I'm on it.
- OK, honey.

02:26.021 --> 02:27.396
I saw your
ship crash.

02:27.606 --> 02:29.941
I wasn't on it.
I'm right here.

02:34.905 --> 02:35.947
Uhh.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.156
Is she all right?

02:37.366 --> 02:38.241
She will be.

02:38.450 --> 02:39.325
I'm sorry, ma'am.

02:39.535 --> 02:41.577
We had no idea
who she was.

02:41.787 --> 02:42.578
Where have you been?

02:42.788 --> 02:43.663
Byrne...

02:43.872 --> 02:44.956
Mount Weather.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.417
The grounders
took you to Mount Weather?

02:48.627 --> 02:50.002
No. The Mountain men.

02:50.212 --> 02:51.295
We have to get
them out.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.131
We're not doing
this right now.

02:53.340 --> 02:54.549
Yes, ma'am.

02:59.429 --> 03:00.555
OK.
Mom.

03:02.099 --> 03:03.850
Did anyone else
make it here?

03:04.059 --> 03:06.811
Yes. 6 of you did.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.188
Finn and Bellamy?

03:12.734 --> 03:14.277
I thought
they were dead.

03:16.363 --> 03:17.864
I thought
you were dead.

03:33.630 --> 03:34.630
Not me.

03:36.717 --> 03:37.884
I'm right here.

04:00.073 --> 04:02.325
Thank you for coming.

04:02.534 --> 04:04.577
I've been told
you visit medical

04:04.786 --> 04:06.120
3 or 4 times a day

04:06.330 --> 04:08.206
asking about Clarke.

04:08.415 --> 04:11.334
Yeah. No one will
let me see her.

04:11.543 --> 04:13.711
That's because she's
no longer here.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.256
Clarke ran away.

04:17.466 --> 04:19.383
I tried
to convince her

04:19.593 --> 04:20.968
that she was
safe here,

04:21.178 --> 04:22.845
but she couldn't
stop looking for

04:23.055 --> 04:25.848
enemies when she
was among friends.

04:26.058 --> 04:26.974
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be

04:27.184 --> 04:29.560
disrespectful but..

04:29.770 --> 04:31.187
Clarke wouldn't
just abandon us.

04:31.396 --> 04:34.023
I wish it
wasn't the case.

04:34.233 --> 04:35.524
Why? Are you
looking for her?

04:35.734 --> 04:38.778
I can't risk the lives
of my people

04:38.987 --> 04:40.029
to bring back
someone who

04:40.239 --> 04:41.239
doesn't want to be here.

04:41.448 --> 04:44.617
I hope you can
understand that.

04:44.826 --> 04:46.035
Yeah.

04:46.245 --> 04:48.996
What I can do
is let you go

04:49.206 --> 04:50.289
after her yourself.

04:54.878 --> 04:55.795
Could I come back?

04:56.004 --> 04:57.255
Of course you can.

04:57.464 --> 05:00.216
Jasper, this is
your home now.

05:00.425 --> 05:01.509
You're welcome
to stay here

05:01.718 --> 05:03.010
as long as you like.

05:08.767 --> 05:10.810
Let me know
what you decide.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.001
Until our final
journey to the ground.

05:46.179 --> 05:49.223
Sir. Prisoner's
refusing water.

06:03.488 --> 06:07.074
If you don't drink,
you'll die.

06:07.284 --> 06:09.618
And if you die,
you won't be able

06:09.828 --> 06:10.911
to help me stop
the killing.

06:14.416 --> 06:17.126
What makes you think
he wants to stop the killing?

06:18.378 --> 06:20.046
I have to believe
they didn't survive

06:20.255 --> 06:21.839
down here all this
time by fighting...

06:24.092 --> 06:25.426
When there was
a better way.

06:41.318 --> 06:42.234
Come on.

06:42.444 --> 06:43.986
Sorry about
the rope.

06:50.660 --> 06:52.203
At least we
know he can talk.

06:56.208 --> 06:57.249
I wish I could.

07:00.796 --> 07:01.962
I knew it.
He doesn't understand

07:02.172 --> 07:02.963
a word we're saying.

07:03.173 --> 07:04.215
It's a tactic.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.175
If we think he
doesn't speak English,

07:06.385 --> 07:08.302
we won't expect him
to tell us anything.

07:08.512 --> 07:10.513
Due respect sir,
then why do we expect him

07:10.722 --> 07:11.555
to lead us
to his commander

07:11.765 --> 07:13.265
and not into a trap?

07:13.475 --> 07:15.226
We don't.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.019
And that's
the beauty of it.

07:17.229 --> 07:18.521
Whether he wants
to kill us

07:18.730 --> 07:20.773
or help us
make peace,

07:20.982 --> 07:21.941
either way...

07:22.984 --> 07:24.318
It's in his
best interest

07:24.528 --> 07:25.778
to take us
to his camp.

07:49.928 --> 07:52.721
I thought you got
thrown off the council.

07:52.931 --> 07:56.058
Oh. It's the
chancellor's pin.

07:56.268 --> 07:57.601
Wait, you?

07:57.811 --> 07:58.811
Yeah.

08:00.689 --> 08:02.231
Thelonious didn't
make it,

08:02.441 --> 08:04.442
and Kane left
two days ago

08:04.651 --> 08:06.152
to try to make peace
with the grounders

08:06.361 --> 08:07.945
to get you and
the others back.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.114
I told you.
The grounders don't have us.

08:14.369 --> 08:15.703
How long have
I been asleep?

08:15.912 --> 08:16.954
About 10 hours.

08:17.122 --> 08:17.997
Ugh.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.708
OK Clarke, slow down. Hey.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.001
It's too soon.

08:23.378 --> 08:25.504
Mom, we need to move
against Mount Weather.

08:25.714 --> 08:26.922
How many guards
are here?

08:27.132 --> 08:28.340
Where are Finn
and Bellamy?

08:28.550 --> 08:30.759
Clarke, please.
You need to rest.

08:30.969 --> 08:33.304
I don't need to rest.
I'm fine.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.347
And I don't need you
to protect me.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.684
What I need is to
save my friends.

08:38.894 --> 08:40.644
Ma'am.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.354
Movement in
the north woods.

08:42.564 --> 08:43.856
Grounders?

08:44.065 --> 08:45.107
I don't think so.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.657
Hi.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.201
I've been waiting
out here all night.

08:55.410 --> 08:56.494
Abby said you
needed sleep.

08:59.915 --> 09:01.207
Raven, I...

09:01.416 --> 09:03.292
Sucks, but I'm
dealing with it.

09:03.502 --> 09:04.335
Open the gate.

09:08.924 --> 09:10.257
Weapon.

09:10.467 --> 09:12.134
Need your weapon.

09:12.344 --> 09:14.803
Weapon secure.

09:15.013 --> 09:16.889
Bellamy.

09:17.098 --> 09:19.099
Go. I'll catch up.

09:19.309 --> 09:20.267
OK.

09:25.273 --> 09:28.442
I know you.
Factory station.

09:28.652 --> 09:30.277
Where are the others?

09:30.487 --> 09:32.196
There are
no others.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.948
Found her a day
from here.

09:34.157 --> 09:36.742
No survivors.
Lots of supplies.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.245
Get her to medical.

09:54.135 --> 09:56.095
Now, there's something
I thought I'd never see.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.398
I'm glad you're OK.

10:08.733 --> 10:09.692
You, too.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.486
How many are
with you?

10:14.072 --> 10:15.072
None.

10:17.576 --> 10:18.534
Where's Finn?

10:21.413 --> 10:22.413
Looking for you.

10:29.671 --> 10:31.839
I count 26.

10:32.048 --> 10:34.508
I got 28.

10:34.718 --> 10:36.969
These people don't
look like warriors, Finn.

10:37.178 --> 10:38.846
And there's kids.
Old people.

10:39.055 --> 10:40.639
There's nothing big
enough here to hold our friends.

10:40.849 --> 10:41.765
They could
be underground.

10:54.237 --> 10:56.530
We wait till dark.
Then we go in.

10:56.740 --> 10:58.198
We go in?

10:58.408 --> 10:59.241
Finn, we don't even know if
our people are here yet.

10:59.451 --> 11:01.035
They're here.

11:01.244 --> 11:03.120
Or they were when that grounder
took Clarke's watch.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.331
What if we're
too late, huh?

11:05.540 --> 11:07.458
They're probably
already dead. We need to--

11:09.544 --> 11:10.544
take it easy.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.514
How much ammo
do we have?

11:24.517 --> 11:26.727
I think I liked you
better as a peacemaker.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.709
I see why Tsing
chose you.

12:02.764 --> 12:06.225
Don't worry. The first dose
is the worst.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.522
We know nothing about
these people in Mount Weather.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.399
Their numbers,
their capabilities.

12:13.566 --> 12:14.608
We need to
proceed carefully.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.944
OK, according to Clarke,
the 47 still inside

12:17.153 --> 12:18.737
are not being harmed,
at least not yet.

12:18.947 --> 12:20.614
Now, I hate to
leave them there,

12:20.824 --> 12:23.534
but if she's right,
we have some time.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.286
OK. We gather intel
on Mount Weather

12:26.496 --> 12:28.038
and we send a team
after Kane.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.249
He needs to know that the grounders
don't have those kids.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.167
What about Finn Collins
and John Murphy?

12:35.296 --> 12:36.505
What? No.

12:36.715 --> 12:37.965
You can't just
cut them loose.

12:38.174 --> 12:39.633
Sweetheart, we
don't have the manpower

12:39.843 --> 12:41.301
to send out two
separate rescue missions

12:41.511 --> 12:42.594
and protect our camp.

12:42.804 --> 12:44.471
Mom. They're
in trouble.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.598
They're either gonna
get themselves killed

12:46.808 --> 12:48.559
or they're gonna make things
worse with the grounders,

12:48.768 --> 12:50.894
who we need to get our people
out of Mount Weather.

12:51.104 --> 12:54.231
I know you feel
this is unfair.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.608
But our priority has to be with
chancellor Kane

12:56.818 --> 12:59.027
if there is any
hope for peace.

12:59.237 --> 13:01.155
If you wanted peace,
you shouldn't have killed

13:01.364 --> 13:02.698
the only grounder who
was gonna help us.

13:02.907 --> 13:05.576
I'm sorry.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.035
The decision's
been made.

13:08.705 --> 13:09.663
You're sorry?

13:11.666 --> 13:13.542
Finn and Murphy
are out there

13:13.752 --> 13:14.877
looking for
your daughter

13:15.086 --> 13:16.754
with guns
you gave us,

13:16.963 --> 13:18.172
and now she's home,

13:18.381 --> 13:19.757
you're just going
to abandon them?

13:22.510 --> 13:25.429
If you can't
spare the guards,

13:25.638 --> 13:26.847
we know the terrain,
we have a map.

13:27.056 --> 13:27.848
We can do it
ourselves.

13:28.057 --> 13:28.974
- Absolutely not.
- Mom.

13:29.184 --> 13:30.350
I just got you back.

13:33.897 --> 13:37.232
Abby.

13:37.442 --> 13:39.777
I'm sorry.
We need you in medical.

13:41.905 --> 13:43.071
You better go.

13:44.407 --> 13:47.242
Byrne?

13:47.452 --> 13:49.119
No one leaves
this camp.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.287
Yes, ma'am.

14:01.257 --> 14:02.633
We're gonna need guns.

14:04.761 --> 14:06.345
I scored you a
couple extra clips.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.473
Hey. My mom's
in surgery

14:09.682 --> 14:11.350
and the team going after
Kane just left.

14:11.559 --> 14:12.392
We should, too.

14:12.602 --> 14:13.435
Did you
find Octavia?

14:13.645 --> 14:16.396
No. I found you.

14:16.606 --> 14:18.190
I'm not letting you
leave here without me.

14:18.399 --> 14:19.775
- Octavia--
- Finn and Murphy are headed for

14:19.984 --> 14:20.859
Lincoln's village.

14:21.069 --> 14:22.653
I've been there.
Have you?

14:22.862 --> 14:23.654
Has she?

14:23.863 --> 14:24.780
You done?

14:28.284 --> 14:29.701
What's this?

14:29.911 --> 14:32.120
Your pack.

14:32.330 --> 14:33.247
Lead the way.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.793
Whoa. Not so fast,
Pocahontas.

14:42.674 --> 14:44.299
I thought you said
it was handled.

14:44.509 --> 14:45.425
It is.

14:47.428 --> 14:48.637
Shut her down, wick.

14:54.936 --> 14:56.019
Handled.

15:12.704 --> 15:13.871
And you believe him?

15:14.080 --> 15:17.207
Yes, I believe him.
Clarke left us, Monty.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.501
She faked being crazy
to get into medical and she took off.

15:19.711 --> 15:20.752
We need to go after her.

15:25.884 --> 15:27.426
Where you going?

15:27.635 --> 15:29.011
The dropship
for starters.

15:29.220 --> 15:32.389
I just heard.
You're leaving?

15:32.599 --> 15:33.682
Yes. We are.

15:33.892 --> 15:35.559
No. We're not.

15:35.768 --> 15:38.729
What would Clarke do?

15:38.938 --> 15:41.356
No, you can't.
It's too dangerous.

15:41.566 --> 15:44.401
Don't worry.
I'm a coward.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.862
You're not. You're smart.

15:48.489 --> 15:50.365
You can't make her
come back.

15:50.575 --> 15:52.784
Monty's right.
She'd go after me.

15:52.994 --> 15:55.871
But why am I so scared
to do the same thing?

15:59.959 --> 16:02.419
Whoa. What...?

16:02.629 --> 16:03.879
Radiation.

16:06.507 --> 16:08.717
There's
a containment breach.

16:08.927 --> 16:10.177
But how?

16:10.386 --> 16:11.762
I don't know! Ah!

16:11.971 --> 16:13.096
What do we do?

16:13.306 --> 16:16.516
No!

16:16.726 --> 16:17.809
No!

16:20.939 --> 16:23.565
Help! Help!

16:23.775 --> 16:26.068
Someone help!

16:26.277 --> 16:27.736
Help!

16:27.946 --> 16:29.196
Somebody help!

16:33.618 --> 16:34.868
Temperature's
104 and rising.

16:35.078 --> 16:37.537
Blood pressure
180 over 120.

16:37.747 --> 16:41.208
Blister coverage now 75%.

16:41.459 --> 16:43.126
Standard treatment
isn't working.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.921
Wait.
What does that mean?

16:46.130 --> 16:49.549
Is there a non-standard
treatment?

16:49.759 --> 16:51.969
There is one thing
we could try.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.762
Then what are you
waiting for?!

16:53.972 --> 16:59.518
It's... unorthodox.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.895
Because you were
raised in space,

17:02.105 --> 17:04.690
your circulatory systems
developed the ability

17:04.899 --> 17:07.025
to filter radiation
out of your blood.

17:07.235 --> 17:11.613
Now it's just a theory,
but if we were to circulate

17:11.823 --> 17:13.949
Maya's blood
through your system...

17:14.158 --> 17:16.618
I could make her better.

17:16.828 --> 17:18.954
What happens to him?

17:19.163 --> 17:21.039
I'm not sure.

17:24.335 --> 17:27.587
I know that look. Don't
even think about it.

17:27.797 --> 17:29.047
It's too dangerous.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.052
I'm in.

17:57.118 --> 18:01.079
Last time I saw you, you were
closing the dropship door.

18:05.168 --> 18:06.752
Had to be done.

18:17.138 --> 18:19.389
Did you get any sleep?

18:19.599 --> 18:23.101
It's OK. I'll sleep
when we find Finn.

18:25.855 --> 18:29.066
You haven't seen him,
Clarke.

18:29.275 --> 18:34.112
Losing you, the others,
the war, it changed him.

18:35.907 --> 18:39.034
He executed the grounder
that drew us the map.

18:39.243 --> 18:43.121
Pulled the trigger without
even blinking and walked away.

18:45.166 --> 18:47.459
That doesn't sound
like Finn.

18:47.668 --> 18:50.295
No, it doesn't.

18:52.090 --> 18:54.424
I saw what
he was capable of,

18:54.634 --> 18:58.762
and still I let him go with Murphy and
2 automatic rifles.

19:01.182 --> 19:03.141
I'm sure that had
to be done, too.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.692
When we got back to
the dropship and no one was there,

19:12.902 --> 19:14.736
we assumed
it was the grounders.

19:14.946 --> 19:16.238
Of course, you did.

19:16.447 --> 19:18.740
You couldn't have known
it was the Mountain men.

19:18.950 --> 19:20.158
No one could have.

19:23.913 --> 19:25.872
How long until
chocolate cake turns into

19:26.082 --> 19:29.084
being hung upside down and
drained for their blood?

19:29.293 --> 19:33.171
I don't know,
but we don't have much time.

19:37.176 --> 19:43.098
OK. First we find Finn,
then our people in Mount Weather.

19:43.307 --> 19:45.183
And Lincoln.

19:49.397 --> 19:51.815
Think we've slept
long enough.

20:04.245 --> 20:07.831
What are you doing? This
wasn't part of your plan.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.207
We're changing the plan.

20:16.299 --> 20:18.216
This is their food.

20:49.290 --> 20:52.167
Distraction? Not bad.

20:52.376 --> 20:53.919
Let's go.

21:25.326 --> 21:26.785
We need to run!

21:26.994 --> 21:28.203
Can't. They'll
kill our people.

21:28.412 --> 21:29.913
They'll kill us!

21:34.460 --> 21:36.044
Who's in charge here?!

21:38.381 --> 21:41.299
I'll ask again.
Who's in charge?

21:49.141 --> 21:52.936
Our leader isn't here.
You can deal with me.

21:53.145 --> 21:56.231
Nobody has to get hurt.
We just want our people back.

21:56.440 --> 21:58.817
We don't have
your people.

21:59.026 --> 22:01.319
Then you won't mind
if we look around.

22:21.590 --> 22:24.467
You see? I told you
it got better.

22:24.677 --> 22:26.261
Your body's already
craving it.

22:48.492 --> 22:49.784
Now.

23:11.640 --> 23:14.267
15 seconds.

23:14.477 --> 23:16.644
That's almost
a record.

23:16.854 --> 23:18.605
This was a thoroughbred.

23:24.737 --> 23:27.906
Up his dosage.
Shock treatments every 2 hours.

23:28.115 --> 23:30.617
When he fears the tone,
we move to phase 2.

23:44.298 --> 23:45.632
You sure about this?

23:48.260 --> 23:50.845
Look at her. I know
you like her,

23:51.055 --> 23:53.640
but her blood is about to go
into your body.

23:57.395 --> 23:58.520
What is it?!

23:58.729 --> 24:00.647
What's happening?!

24:02.817 --> 24:04.651
We need to do this now.

24:04.860 --> 24:06.653
- Jasper.
- I can't just let her die!

24:08.322 --> 24:09.656
Let's do this.

24:15.704 --> 24:17.580
This will sting a little.

24:17.790 --> 24:19.666
Ow! A little?!

24:56.745 --> 24:58.621
What is it?
What's wrong?

24:58.831 --> 25:03.710
Nothing. I feel nice.

25:03.919 --> 25:06.171
Maya's been
heavily sedated.

25:06.380 --> 25:10.133
You will, of course,
feel that, too.

25:10.342 --> 25:13.261
It's perfectly normal.

25:13.471 --> 25:17.724
If you've never done this before,
how do you know?

25:19.477 --> 25:24.606
You're right. I should have
said: It's to be expected.

25:24.815 --> 25:28.526
This will take a while.
Why don't you head back to your room?

25:28.736 --> 25:30.737
I'll send for
you once he's awake.

25:54.428 --> 25:56.387
Did you know about this?

25:57.848 --> 25:59.390
No.

26:03.812 --> 26:07.023
Sure. Have a seat.

26:07.233 --> 26:09.317
Tell me where they went and
you won't be in trouble.

26:09.527 --> 26:10.818
Abby, I--

26:11.028 --> 26:12.695
someone let them
through the fence.

26:12.905 --> 26:14.781
Someone gave them guns.

26:16.700 --> 26:18.076
I don't know what
you're talk--

26:31.840 --> 26:33.550
Ohh...

26:43.435 --> 26:45.687
She thinks that because of what
she's been through

26:45.896 --> 26:51.693
she's changed, but
she's still just a kid.

26:51.902 --> 26:54.445
You're wrong, Abby.

26:56.448 --> 27:00.118
She stopped being a kid the day
you sent her down here to die.

27:11.130 --> 27:12.422
Stay sharp!

27:12.631 --> 27:13.840
Yes, sir.

27:50.377 --> 27:53.880
Sir, that's a bad idea.

27:56.592 --> 27:58.343
This is as far as you go.

27:58.552 --> 28:00.803
Sir?

28:01.013 --> 28:05.892
If I'm wrong about this,
only one of us has to die.

28:07.895 --> 28:10.813
Go home. That's an order.

28:11.023 --> 28:12.899
Yes, sir.

28:14.902 --> 28:16.527
Let's go.

28:24.578 --> 28:26.537
Your knife, too.

28:51.605 --> 28:55.942
Let this be the first step
toward peace.

29:47.911 --> 29:49.704
Uhh!

29:49.913 --> 29:51.789
Aahh...

30:37.544 --> 30:39.462
So we meet again.

31:24.007 --> 31:27.635
I told you,
we don't have your people.

31:27.845 --> 31:28.886
Stop talking.

31:46.572 --> 31:48.322
Find something?

31:50.576 --> 31:51.909
Finn!

31:55.372 --> 31:58.749
Finn, answer me!
Are you all right?

31:58.959 --> 32:01.878
Hey, on your knees!
On your knees, now!

32:02.087 --> 32:03.296
On your knees!

32:05.799 --> 32:07.383
Finn!

32:13.181 --> 32:14.765
Slow down.

32:17.644 --> 32:18.769
What have you done
with them?

32:20.814 --> 32:22.148
Hey, Finn, Finn!
Come on!

32:22.357 --> 32:24.066
Their clothes are here!

32:24.276 --> 32:25.526
They were here!

32:28.405 --> 32:29.322
Finn!

32:29.531 --> 32:30.948
You killed them!

32:39.750 --> 32:42.335
Your friends were
not here.

32:42.544 --> 32:45.838
I saw one, Octavia.
She was alone.

32:48.717 --> 32:50.092
These people are
scavengers, Finn.

32:50.302 --> 32:52.720
They could've just
found that stuff.

32:54.306 --> 32:55.723
Hey, Finn, stop!
Stop! Look at me.

32:55.933 --> 32:56.807
Get off me!

32:59.478 --> 33:01.187
Finn, don't do this.

33:03.190 --> 33:06.984
Let's just walk out of here
while we still can, OK?

33:10.864 --> 33:12.198
Finn.

33:13.450 --> 33:14.992
Please.

33:53.490 --> 33:55.032
This is it.

33:56.910 --> 33:58.452
Which way
to the village?

34:02.708 --> 34:04.458
O?

34:06.128 --> 34:07.712
The reapers came
from there.

34:15.637 --> 34:17.680
I couldn't save him,
bell.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.894
I couldn't save him.

34:44.124 --> 34:45.833
Phase one's complete.

34:46.043 --> 34:47.752
Start phase two.

34:58.138 --> 35:00.014
One dose.

35:03.769 --> 35:05.519
Who wants it more?

36:41.491 --> 36:44.493
Welcome back.

36:44.703 --> 36:46.078
What happened?

36:46.288 --> 36:47.746
Containment breach
in the dorm.

36:47.956 --> 36:50.499
No one's ever been as sick as you
and come back.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.293
How do you feel?

36:52.502 --> 36:55.963
I feel...Great.

36:56.173 --> 36:57.798
How is that possible?

37:00.302 --> 37:02.178
Jasper saved your life,
Maya.

37:04.639 --> 37:05.764
Hey...

37:10.937 --> 37:12.771
Can we speak with
you outside, please?

37:17.235 --> 37:18.819
I told you
you were brave.

37:26.244 --> 37:27.703
It was an emergency.

37:27.913 --> 37:29.163
We couldn't reach
you in time.

37:29.372 --> 37:30.706
You expect us
to believe that?

37:33.418 --> 37:37.421
Sir, I apologize for going around you,
but it worked.

37:37.631 --> 37:39.173
How is the patient?

37:39.382 --> 37:41.508
Her recovery
is miraculous.

37:41.718 --> 37:43.260
I was referring
to Jasper.

37:43.470 --> 37:46.680
He'll recover,
as I assured you he would.

37:46.890 --> 37:47.765
That's not the point.

37:47.974 --> 37:48.766
You disobeyed
a direct order

37:48.975 --> 37:50.142
from the president

37:50.352 --> 37:51.727
not to experiment
on those kids.

37:51.937 --> 37:53.187
Mr. president,

37:53.396 --> 37:55.731
why bring them here
if not to use them?

37:55.941 --> 37:57.399
That's none
of your concern.

37:57.609 --> 37:59.944
Shouldn't you be in the dungeon
with your monsters?

38:00.153 --> 38:02.404
They're not monsters.
They are soldiers.

38:02.614 --> 38:05.324
And the reason why you get to play
doctor in your ivory tower.

38:05.533 --> 38:07.034
That's enough.
Both of you.

38:07.244 --> 38:09.453
We all have jobs to do.

38:09.663 --> 38:12.331
Mine is to be obeyed.

38:12.540 --> 38:13.999
Yes, sir.

38:14.209 --> 38:20.005
Can I just say...
The first human trial was a success.

38:20.215 --> 38:22.091
After what we saw tonight,
in my opinion,

38:22.300 --> 38:26.178
we have no choice but to move ahead
with the forty-seven.

38:26.388 --> 38:28.055
That'll be all,
Dr. Tsing.

38:42.612 --> 38:45.656
Tell me about
the radiation leak.

38:45.865 --> 38:49.994
The air filtration
system malfunctioned,

38:50.203 --> 38:51.620
but the containment
system worked.

38:51.830 --> 38:54.331
Malfunctioned?

38:54.541 --> 38:56.208
I'll look into it.

38:56.418 --> 38:59.378
Now go paint, dad.

38:59.587 --> 39:03.299
I'm your head of security.
I'll clean this up.

39:03.508 --> 39:05.801
You have a big
decision to make.

39:06.011 --> 39:08.012
What would you do?

39:09.931 --> 39:13.017
Me?

39:13.226 --> 39:14.852
I'd use them.

39:15.061 --> 39:17.229
Just like that?

39:19.357 --> 39:21.358
Our people come first,
right?

39:32.537 --> 39:35.039
Look, just because their clothes
are here, doesn't mean anything.

39:35.248 --> 39:37.624
He told us our friends were here.
Why would he do that?

39:37.834 --> 39:39.001
The guy with one eye?

39:39.252 --> 39:40.919
Maybe because you had
a gun to his head, Finn.

39:41.129 --> 39:42.629
The man with one eye.

39:42.839 --> 39:45.424
You saw Delano.

39:45.633 --> 39:48.093
A snake. A thief.

39:48.303 --> 39:50.596
He and his men
were cast out.

39:50.805 --> 39:52.306
You are his revenge.

39:55.977 --> 39:57.186
It makes sense.

39:57.395 --> 39:59.438
Finn. OK,
we need to go.

39:59.647 --> 40:02.524
