05:47.040 --> 05:49.220
- Hey, how's it going?

05:49.221 --> 05:50.319
- Good.

05:50.320 --> 05:51.320
- Good.

05:51.320 --> 05:52.320
Nice day for a hike.

05:54.240 --> 05:55.240
- Yeah.

05:57.099 --> 05:59.487
Know much about the area?

05:59.488 --> 06:01.321
- About the Terrortory?

06:02.341 --> 06:04.979
- Yeah, the Terrortory.

06:04.980 --> 06:08.379
- Well actually, I've spent the
last two years mapping it.

06:08.380 --> 06:09.380
- Really?

06:10.320 --> 06:11.549
- Really.

06:11.550 --> 06:12.639
- Why?

06:12.640 --> 06:14.049
- Curiosity.

06:14.050 --> 06:16.300
Something to pass the
time during retirement.

06:17.690 --> 06:19.290
But that first month
out of here...

06:22.199 --> 06:23.199
- What?

06:25.460 --> 06:26.460
- I saw things.

06:28.050 --> 06:29.050
- Like what?

06:29.974 --> 06:30.950
- The thing is, I could
tell you about it

06:30.951 --> 06:33.489
but that would take time.

06:33.490 --> 06:35.240
And I've only got
so much daylight.

06:36.140 --> 06:39.509
I don't stay out here past
sundown if I can help it.

06:39.510 --> 06:41.039
- If you don't mind,
I can tag along,

06:41.040 --> 06:42.483
hear some stories.

06:46.510 --> 06:47.510
- Sure.

06:48.859 --> 06:51.459
Gonna have to warn you, I
stop a lot to make notes.

06:51.460 --> 06:52.460
- No problem.

07:10.726 --> 07:11.989
- See, the Terrortory's
not what everybody

07:11.990 --> 07:13.659
thinks it is.

07:13.660 --> 07:16.669
They think it's this huge
area where bad shit happens.

07:16.670 --> 07:19.919
Yeah, okay it is, but
it's not just that.

07:19.920 --> 07:20.933
I mean it's huge.

07:21.870 --> 07:24.329
I myself don't even
know where it ends.

07:24.330 --> 07:26.149
- I'm Greg by the way.

07:26.150 --> 07:27.150
- Aiden.

07:27.900 --> 07:28.913
Yeah, it's crazy.

07:30.145 --> 07:32.569
I mean there are whole areas
in it that are relatively safe

07:32.570 --> 07:33.979
to be in.

07:33.980 --> 07:38.079
Hell, there's a whole town
located inside the lines.

07:38.080 --> 07:39.080
- What town?

07:39.750 --> 07:41.323
- Believe me,
you've heard of it.

07:42.520 --> 07:44.969
Yeah, the Terrortory's
not like one region

07:44.970 --> 07:47.099
where random bad things happen.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.959
The things, like you've
heard of Smiling Jack?

07:49.960 --> 07:52.503
Each thing has its own
area that it stays in.

07:53.550 --> 07:55.729
And there are buffer
zones between the areas.

07:55.730 --> 07:59.309
Buffer zones where it's
completely safe to be in.

07:59.310 --> 08:00.610
- Are we in one right now?

08:01.680 --> 08:03.129
- Yeah.

08:03.130 --> 08:05.709
If you take this trail
and go off to the left

08:05.710 --> 08:07.569
we'll be heading
toward the Fountain.

08:07.570 --> 08:09.379
- Doesn't sound so bad.

08:09.380 --> 08:11.442
- Oh, you never heard of it?

08:11.443 --> 08:12.443
- Uh uh.

08:13.221 --> 08:15.063
- Well, I'll tell you
the story I've heard.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.859
- This can't be right.

08:17.860 --> 08:19.069
- There hasn't been another road

08:19.070 --> 08:20.729
since we left the highway.

08:20.730 --> 08:22.280
- Maybe we took the wrong exit.

08:25.210 --> 08:26.610
- Well we're not on the map.

08:28.140 --> 08:29.733
No man's land for sure.

08:30.690 --> 08:32.789
Who told you about
this place anyways?

08:32.789 --> 08:34.688
- There were some
photos at a gallery.

08:34.690 --> 08:35.889
I asked the dealer.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.640
- And he said to vanish off
into the middle of nowhere.

08:40.510 --> 08:42.469
- You didn't have to come.

08:42.470 --> 08:44.319
- And miss out on all the fun?

08:44.320 --> 08:46.679
- I think we passed a country
store right off the exit.

08:46.680 --> 08:49.019
Maybe we should turn around
and ask for directions.

08:49.020 --> 08:52.009
- Megs, that's like 20 minutes
back the way we came.

08:52.010 --> 08:53.829
- Maybe we missed the turn.

08:53.830 --> 08:55.480
We should have
been there by now.

09:00.350 --> 09:02.300
- Hope I can dodge
all this traffic.

09:36.770 --> 09:37.803
Cheery place.

09:38.770 --> 09:40.823
I wouldn't use the
restroom if I were you.

10:26.937 --> 10:27.999
Hey.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.816
- Hello, I'm Lamia.

10:29.817 --> 10:32.759
- Lamia, that's a
pretty unique name.

10:32.760 --> 10:34.289
- It's my grandmother's.

10:34.290 --> 10:35.290
- It's beautiful.

10:38.470 --> 10:40.929
- Was there something
I can help you with?

10:40.930 --> 10:43.559
- Yeah, my wife and me
seem to be a little lost.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.709
There's a garden around here,

10:45.710 --> 10:47.819
somewhere in the
forest, I believe.

10:47.820 --> 10:49.459
Can't seem to find
the road though.

10:49.460 --> 10:50.901
- You're not lost.

10:50.902 --> 10:51.902
- No?

10:53.340 --> 10:54.433
- You're right here.

10:57.660 --> 11:00.399
It's super close, I can
show you if you like.

11:00.400 --> 11:01.400
- Show me.

11:45.060 --> 11:46.060
- Hey Tom.

11:48.630 --> 11:49.949
- Hey babe.

11:49.950 --> 11:50.783
- Any luck?

11:50.784 --> 11:53.609
- Yeah, it's just, we're just,

11:53.610 --> 11:55.409
- I was just telling
your husband that

11:55.410 --> 11:58.549
behind the gas station is a
path that leads to the garden.

11:58.550 --> 12:00.039
It's a really short walk.

12:00.040 --> 12:01.269
You can even leave
your car here.

12:01.270 --> 12:02.270
- Really?

12:03.470 --> 12:06.129
- I can show you if you like.

12:06.130 --> 12:08.030
- No thanks, I think
I already saw it.

12:10.320 --> 12:11.320
Are you ready?

12:12.800 --> 12:13.800
- Yeah.

12:14.530 --> 12:15.530
Yeah.

12:16.480 --> 12:17.480
Thank you.

12:20.110 --> 12:21.399
- There's a fountain.

12:21.400 --> 12:22.984
- What's that?

12:22.985 --> 12:24.685
- In the path,
there's a fountain.

12:26.040 --> 12:27.763
Make sure you both make a wish.

12:28.860 --> 12:30.413
- Right, thank you.

12:32.280 --> 12:33.280
- Thank you.

12:41.500 --> 12:42.500
- There.

12:57.060 --> 12:58.740
- Pretty lucky, huh?

12:58.741 --> 12:59.741
- Mhmm.

12:59.742 --> 13:01.462
- Well we could have
been driving for hours.

13:03.960 --> 13:05.019
What, what's wrong?

13:05.020 --> 13:05.920
- Forget it.

13:05.920 --> 13:06.920
- Tell me.

13:07.740 --> 13:09.059
- What was going on in there?

13:09.060 --> 13:09.970
- What are you talking about?

13:09.971 --> 13:12.029
- You were practically
drooling on her.

13:12.030 --> 13:14.439
- Who, the girl
back at the store?

13:14.440 --> 13:15.440
Come on, Megan.

13:17.040 --> 13:19.669
- I'm just starting to
think that this thing

13:19.670 --> 13:20.503
will never happen.

13:20.504 --> 13:22.089
- What thing?

13:22.090 --> 13:23.959
- Kids, Tom, children?

13:23.960 --> 13:25.019
- Okay, you got me there.

13:25.020 --> 13:26.899
What do kids and the
chick at the store

13:26.900 --> 13:28.219
have anything to do together?

13:28.220 --> 13:29.839
- You say you're not
ready to have a baby

13:29.840 --> 13:31.619
but I'm starting to
wonder if that's because

13:31.620 --> 13:32.719
you have one foot out the door.

13:32.720 --> 13:33.996
- I don't have one
foot out the door.

13:33.997 --> 13:35.597
- And you're looking for an out.

13:38.170 --> 13:39.970
- I'm not looking
for an out, Megan.

13:41.580 --> 13:44.849
What happened last year,
that was a mistake,

13:44.850 --> 13:46.023
a big mistake.

13:47.500 --> 13:49.979
But you and I, we've
worked so hard

13:49.980 --> 13:51.430
to get through that together.

13:52.530 --> 13:53.579
I don't want you to feel like...

13:53.580 --> 13:55.803
- I know, I'm just
insecure, okay?

14:02.670 --> 14:03.970
- You're all I need, Megs.

14:05.030 --> 14:06.030
You're all I want.

14:18.180 --> 14:19.929
Uh, is this it?

14:19.930 --> 14:20.930
- I think so.

14:22.524 --> 14:23.524
- Pff.

14:34.733 --> 14:36.393
Well maybe it's out of season.

14:40.740 --> 14:41.740
That's not good.

14:46.980 --> 14:48.759
- The water looks disgusting.

14:48.760 --> 14:50.633
- Yeah, smells bad
too, but fuck it.

14:54.090 --> 14:55.399
Two pennies, two wishes.

14:55.400 --> 14:56.400
What do you say?

14:58.580 --> 14:59.580
- You first.

15:09.668 --> 15:10.629
What'd you wish for?

15:10.630 --> 15:13.770
- You know the rules,
I can't tell you.

15:13.771 --> 15:14.771
Your turn.

15:45.297 --> 15:46.897
Did you see enough, ready to go?

15:47.921 --> 15:49.189
We gotta hike.

15:49.190 --> 15:50.383
- Yeah, let's go.

15:51.258 --> 15:52.258
- Okay.

16:04.670 --> 16:07.589
- It shouldn't take
this long to get back.

16:07.590 --> 16:09.119
- We haven't left the path.

16:09.120 --> 16:11.199
We stay on it, we
get to the road.

16:11.200 --> 16:12.900
- We should have
been back by now.

16:14.356 --> 16:16.169
Ooh, ow,

16:16.170 --> 16:17.359
- What's wrong?

16:17.360 --> 16:18.619
- My stomach.

16:18.620 --> 16:19.999
- You gonna be sick?

16:20.000 --> 16:21.713
- Just give me a minute.

16:23.476 --> 16:26.078
- Did you eat something
back at the store?

16:26.079 --> 16:31.029
- Mm-mmm.

16:31.030 --> 16:32.030
I'm okay.

16:33.390 --> 16:34.714
- You sure?

16:34.715 --> 16:36.048
- Let's just go.

16:47.883 --> 16:49.713
- That can't be the
same fountain.

16:50.640 --> 16:52.959
- How many fountains do you
think are out here, Tom?

16:52.960 --> 16:53.989
- What, I don't know.

16:53.990 --> 16:56.349
Maybe we got turned
around somehow.

16:56.350 --> 16:58.363
- In a straight line, on a path?

17:01.940 --> 17:03.529
- Jesus, babe.

17:03.530 --> 17:04.530
Look, sit.

17:05.356 --> 17:06.856
Come on, sit down.

17:08.460 --> 17:09.999
- Something's wrong with me.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
- What should I do?

17:22.028 --> 17:23.528
Are you all right?

17:25.386 --> 17:26.582
Okay, I'm just gonna go
up this way for a bit.

17:26.583 --> 17:28.979
Just try for some signal, okay?

17:28.980 --> 17:29.999
- Okay.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.269
Don't be long.

17:31.270 --> 17:32.270
- I won't.

17:37.860 --> 17:39.283
Come on, come on!

17:42.506 --> 17:43.706
Fuck!

17:54.660 --> 17:56.410
Oh, come on, come on!

18:01.112 --> 18:02.112
Megan, Megan!

18:24.910 --> 18:25.910
Megs!

18:27.550 --> 18:29.363
- I wished to be pregnant.

18:31.470 --> 18:33.340
Wish it away, wish it away!

18:37.387 --> 18:38.687
- I don't have any change!

18:49.580 --> 18:50.580
Oh god.

18:51.660 --> 18:53.010
Oh I can't feel the bottom.

18:54.720 --> 18:56.350
There's something in here.

19:16.688 --> 19:17.688
Megs!

20:16.176 --> 20:19.391
- You wanted to fuck the
girl at the gas station.

20:19.392 --> 20:22.059
Well here's your wish come true.

21:14.370 --> 21:15.683
- Morning Sheriff.

21:19.102 --> 21:20.319
Is there anything
I can do for you?

21:20.320 --> 21:22.049
- Business been good?

21:22.050 --> 21:23.559
- I can't complain.

21:23.560 --> 21:24.480
- How's your mama?

21:24.480 --> 21:25.420
- Laid up with the gout.

21:25.421 --> 21:27.013
- Uh, shame, nice lady.

21:29.210 --> 21:30.660
- Something I can do for you?

21:31.640 --> 21:34.729
- Some fellow was found naked
wandering along the highway

21:34.730 --> 21:36.619
earlier this morning.

21:36.620 --> 21:39.540
Said he was attacked
by some creature

21:40.400 --> 21:42.529
and that his wife was
dead up in them woods.

21:42.530 --> 21:44.289
- Too bad.

21:44.290 --> 21:46.479
- My guess is when I run
the plates on that car

21:46.480 --> 21:49.453
parked outside, it'll
come back to them.

21:51.030 --> 21:53.603
You need to quit sending
people out that way.

21:54.450 --> 21:55.563
It ain't right.

21:59.440 --> 22:01.649
- I didn't hear you complain
when I sent your wife

22:01.650 --> 22:03.929
out there last year, Earl.

22:03.930 --> 22:05.830
And she made a little
wish of her own.

22:12.390 --> 22:13.539
Anything else?

22:13.540 --> 22:14.540
- That'll do me.

22:17.860 --> 22:19.283
- Have a good day.

23:03.745 --> 23:05.126
- Yeah, I've never
heard that one before.

23:05.127 --> 23:06.169
- Yeah, and why is that?

23:06.170 --> 23:07.839
So few stories about
the Fountain,

23:07.840 --> 23:11.893
so many about Smiling Jack
and the Midnight Clown.

23:15.690 --> 23:16.680
Wait, stop.

23:16.681 --> 23:17.860
- What's the matter?

23:32.610 --> 23:34.239
- No, we should be okay.

23:34.240 --> 23:35.240
- What?

23:36.550 --> 23:39.129
- Yeah, whenever I run
into someone out here

23:39.130 --> 23:40.879
I always wanna make sure
I'm in a buffer area

23:40.880 --> 23:44.593
because that someone
could be a something.

24:01.110 --> 24:02.299
- How you doing?

24:02.300 --> 24:03.619
- Good.

24:03.620 --> 24:04.899
Hiking?

24:04.900 --> 24:05.900
- Not really.

24:06.690 --> 24:07.523
- No?

24:07.524 --> 24:09.000
- You seen any
cool shit, mister?

24:09.900 --> 24:10.780
- What do you mean?

24:10.781 --> 24:12.673
- We wanted to see Smiling Jack.

24:15.880 --> 24:18.959
- I think I know where you
might be able to see him.

24:18.960 --> 24:20.660
You sure that's
what you wanna do?

24:21.730 --> 24:23.109
It's dangerous.

24:23.110 --> 24:24.270
- He's not fucking real, man.

24:25.570 --> 24:28.009
- Oh he's real, I've seen him.

24:28.010 --> 24:28.940
- You have?

24:28.941 --> 24:30.109
- Bullshit.

24:30.110 --> 24:31.110
- What was he like?

24:32.473 --> 24:33.789
- It's just some
dumbass prankster

24:33.790 --> 24:35.143
in a pumpkin mask.

24:37.594 --> 24:38.594
- Can you take us?

24:40.920 --> 24:43.279
- Well, if that's
what you really want.

24:43.280 --> 24:45.869
- That's it Tabby, after that,
we're just gonna head back.

24:45.870 --> 24:46.909
- Fine.

24:46.910 --> 24:49.253
- Okay, follow me,
it's not that far.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.863
This is Greg, I'm Aiden.

24:55.700 --> 24:58.823
- I'm Tabby, and that's
Lucas, Chase and Conner.

25:16.773 --> 25:18.606
- Okay, it's that way.

25:19.730 --> 25:21.809
You follow the trail until
you see fresh straw

25:21.810 --> 25:22.643
on the ground.

25:22.644 --> 25:25.175
That way you'll know
you're in the right area.

25:25.176 --> 25:27.437
- You guys didn't
wanna come with us?

25:27.438 --> 25:29.679
- No, we have other
things to check out.

25:29.680 --> 25:31.180
- Like the Whispering Cadaver?

25:33.100 --> 25:34.483
- Yeah, like that.

25:35.670 --> 25:37.659
- Well thanks for showing us.

25:37.660 --> 25:38.660
- You're welcome.

25:40.686 --> 25:41.686
Be careful.

25:42.560 --> 25:43.560
- Take it easy.

25:55.588 --> 25:57.838
- So where we heading next?

25:59.130 --> 26:00.509
- We're gonna follow them.

26:00.510 --> 26:01.860
I wanna show you something.

26:03.508 --> 26:04.863
But we have to be very careful.

26:22.210 --> 26:23.637
- I'm gonna go take a piss.

26:36.894 --> 26:37.894
- What?

27:12.886 --> 27:14.636
- What are you doing?

28:06.872 --> 28:08.211
- Holy shit.

28:15.118 --> 28:16.118
- Yeah.

28:18.488 --> 28:19.488
- Look!

28:24.680 --> 28:25.640
- Hey!

28:25.641 --> 28:26.996
Get the fuck out of here

28:26.997 --> 28:28.847
before we jam that
knife up your ass!

28:36.080 --> 28:38.283
We ain't fucking
around, pumpkin head.

28:40.620 --> 28:41.803
I fucking warned you.

28:54.020 --> 28:55.359
That's what I thought.

28:55.360 --> 28:57.327
Now get the hell out of here.

29:12.961 --> 29:14.123
- We gotta help.

29:14.124 --> 29:15.559
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

29:15.560 --> 29:16.860
There's nothing we can do.

29:18.630 --> 29:20.279
I've seen it chopped
to pieces with an ax.

29:20.280 --> 29:22.053
I've seen it shot a dozen times.

29:23.090 --> 29:24.090
Nothing stops it.

29:45.070 --> 29:46.503
- Go, go, go, go!

29:51.230 --> 29:52.523
- Hey!

29:52.524 --> 29:55.380
- What the fuck are you doing?

30:12.089 --> 30:13.089
- Run!

30:19.570 --> 30:21.070
Come on, he's right behind us.

30:24.050 --> 30:25.533
- No, no.

30:28.200 --> 30:30.549
It's okay, the trail
is the boundary.

30:30.550 --> 30:31.550
He can't cross it.

31:05.100 --> 31:06.185
- Let me grab it.

31:06.186 --> 31:08.276
- No, no, no, come on,
we gotta go, man.

32:13.993 --> 32:16.043
- Thanks, I must have
looked at it wrong.

32:17.870 --> 32:19.383
This is the actual boundary.

32:21.077 --> 32:23.243
I gotta make a note.

32:26.798 --> 32:29.154
- All right, let's
get out of here.

32:29.155 --> 32:32.902
That thing's freaky
as fuck, man.

32:32.903 --> 32:35.047
- No, no, not that
way, this way.

33:03.600 --> 33:04.800
- Hey, hold up a minute.

33:10.110 --> 33:11.693
Why the hell do you
come out here?

33:14.430 --> 33:15.780
- I need to finish the map.

33:16.870 --> 33:18.959
- You'll get killed
before that happens.

33:18.960 --> 33:20.237
Why is it so important?

33:21.340 --> 33:22.839
- Why?

33:22.840 --> 33:23.840
Think about it.

33:25.260 --> 33:27.160
People don't think
this place is real.

33:28.899 --> 33:31.569
They think it's some
kind of urban legend.

33:31.570 --> 33:32.570
But it is real.

33:33.450 --> 33:37.713
It's a real Bermuda Triangle of
supernatural manifestations.

33:40.280 --> 33:41.909
If I can make an accurate map,

33:41.910 --> 33:43.683
we can study this place safely.

33:45.330 --> 33:46.163
Well then maybe
we can figure out

33:46.164 --> 33:48.779
what these things are and
where they come from.

33:48.780 --> 33:49.963
It could save lives.

33:50.980 --> 33:52.593
- Yeah, these things,

33:53.740 --> 33:55.919
why are they all so homicidal?

33:55.920 --> 33:56.920
- Well, they're not.

33:57.910 --> 33:59.399
Not all of them are malevolent.

33:59.400 --> 34:01.849
I've seen some things
that were strange

34:01.850 --> 34:03.263
but perfectly harmless.

34:05.720 --> 34:07.919
- So what about this
Midnight Clown?

34:07.920 --> 34:08.920
- What about him?

34:10.194 --> 34:11.518
- Is he like Smiling Jack

34:11.520 --> 34:12.837
or would bullets hurt him?

34:13.993 --> 34:14.993
- I'm not sure.

34:15.920 --> 34:17.609
Bullets and weapons don't seem

34:17.610 --> 34:19.163
to hurt these things.

34:20.117 --> 34:21.418
- What does?

34:21.420 --> 34:24.579
- The legends of the
Terrortory give us clues.

34:24.580 --> 34:25.733
There are rules.

34:26.810 --> 34:31.054
If you can beat these
things using their rules,

34:31.054 --> 34:32.553
then I think it hurts them.

34:34.011 --> 34:35.748
- I don't understand.

34:35.750 --> 34:39.339
- Well, take the Midnight
Clown, for instance.

34:39.340 --> 34:41.572
The legend is he
only lets one live.

34:43.350 --> 34:46.489
Group of campers comes
in, only one leaves

34:46.489 --> 34:48.109
to tell the tale.

34:48.110 --> 34:49.668
- So?

34:49.670 --> 34:53.509
- So, I once saw a smart girl

34:53.510 --> 34:55.933
go in to the Midnight
Clown's territory alone.

34:56.840 --> 34:59.403
She gave him the finger
and walked away.

35:00.320 --> 35:03.889
The clown disappeared and
didn't reappear for months.

35:03.890 --> 35:04.939
- And what happened to her?

35:04.940 --> 35:07.999
- Well she got lost trying
to get out of the Terrortory

35:08.000 --> 35:11.156
and wandered into the
Two-Headed Torso's area.

35:11.157 --> 35:12.548
- The Two-Headed Torso?

35:12.549 --> 35:13.732
- Yeah.

35:13.733 --> 35:15.449
- You know what, forget it.

35:15.450 --> 35:16.749
- So you pay attention
to the rules

35:16.750 --> 35:18.929
and you can make it out of here.

35:18.930 --> 35:20.319
You've heard of the
Pumpkin Trail?

35:20.320 --> 35:21.399
- No.

35:21.400 --> 35:23.533
- Perfectly safe to
follow it for a bit.

35:25.470 --> 35:26.629
Don't make it to the end.

35:26.630 --> 35:29.093
Make it to the end of the
pumpkin trail, you die.

35:30.640 --> 35:31.570
- That happened?

35:31.571 --> 35:33.749
Someone made it to the end?

35:33.750 --> 35:35.109
- Yeah, do you wanna
hear about it?

35:35.110 --> 35:36.437
- Sure.

35:52.040 --> 35:54.703
- I tell you about my
grandpappy's book, Toe?

35:55.670 --> 35:57.289
- Nope.

35:57.290 --> 35:59.559
- He grew up in the deep south.

35:59.560 --> 36:02.569
My grandpappy used to sit
on the porch at night

36:02.570 --> 36:04.670
listening to the crickets
with his friend.

36:06.030 --> 36:07.709
I tell you this story, Coombs?

36:07.710 --> 36:09.283
- Can't say as it rings a bell.

36:10.750 --> 36:12.499
- My grandpappy says
that the crickets

36:12.500 --> 36:15.439
would get so loud when
the moon came out

36:15.440 --> 36:18.736
he could barely hear his
friend Jigaboo talk.

36:18.737 --> 36:19.570
- Jigaboo?

36:19.571 --> 36:21.289
His friend's name was Jigaboo?

36:21.290 --> 36:22.160
- Yessir.

36:22.161 --> 36:23.966
That's why he called his book.

36:23.967 --> 36:26.319
"Jigaboo and the Moon Crickets".

36:26.320 --> 36:27.919
- Bullshit.

36:27.920 --> 36:28.753
- What do you mean?

36:28.753 --> 36:29.660
- He didn't write no book

36:29.661 --> 36:31.389
called "Jigaboo and
the Moon Crickets".

36:31.390 --> 36:32.390
- Sure did.

36:35.810 --> 36:38.539
Friend used to bring his
pet monkey sometimes.

36:38.540 --> 36:40.256
That's why he wrote
another book called.

36:40.257 --> 36:42.509
"Jigaboo and the Porch Monkey".

36:42.510 --> 36:44.117
- You're an ass, Willie.

36:46.420 --> 36:47.797
- Got something.

36:59.500 --> 37:00.833
Oh, bust.

37:02.474 --> 37:04.993
Why'd we come so far
out here anyway?

37:05.840 --> 37:06.969
If we'd gone to the beach

37:06.970 --> 37:08.769
at least we'd get
some taffy afterward.

37:08.770 --> 37:12.079
- A friend of mine found a damn
diamond ring here last year.

37:12.080 --> 37:14.419
Got 1200 bucks for it.

37:14.420 --> 37:16.959
Says kids come out here all
the time and lose stuff.

37:16.960 --> 37:19.909
- The proof does not appear
to be in the pudding.

37:19.910 --> 37:21.133
- Let's try further on.

37:34.220 --> 37:36.439
- Where are we gonna
eat after we're done?

37:36.440 --> 37:37.513
- Golden Corral.

37:38.789 --> 37:41.063
- Oh, we don't gotta
eat there every time.

37:44.870 --> 37:45.943
- Happy Halloween.

37:48.148 --> 37:50.763
- What do you make of that?

37:51.770 --> 37:53.783
A little early for
Halloween, ain't it?

38:10.120 --> 38:12.883
- Is it reacting to the
metal around the candle?

38:13.917 --> 38:14.917
- I don't think so.

38:48.320 --> 38:51.029
Huh, holy dang.

38:51.030 --> 38:52.119
It's a nickel.

38:52.120 --> 38:53.283
- What's the year?

38:55.270 --> 38:57.774
- 1873.

38:57.775 --> 38:58.989
- Oh boy, that's old.

38:58.990 --> 39:00.833
- Yeah, as old as you.

39:02.415 --> 39:03.765
Let me check this out here.

39:07.150 --> 39:08.283
Let's see here.

39:09.120 --> 39:11.953
Eh, wrong book, just
gonna be a second.

39:12.930 --> 39:14.833
All right, all
right, all righty.

39:16.800 --> 39:21.259
Ah, hoo boy, 1873,
is that right?

39:21.260 --> 39:22.809
- Yeah?

39:22.810 --> 39:24.099
- It got a shield on the back?

39:24.100 --> 39:25.214
- Yeah.

39:25.215 --> 39:26.389
- Ooh boy.

39:26.390 --> 39:27.350
What kind of shape's it in?

39:27.351 --> 39:28.979
- I don't know.

39:28.980 --> 39:30.549
What's it worth, Sherlock?

39:30.550 --> 39:33.919
- Somewhere between $24
and $1800 dollars.

39:34.752 --> 39:36.217
So even if it ain't
in great shape,

39:36.218 --> 39:38.363
still worth a couple
hundred bucks.

39:40.710 --> 39:43.532
- I think you're gonna owe
your friend a bourbon.

39:46.600 --> 39:47.600
- Hey.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.357
I'm checking that one.

39:52.700 --> 39:53.700
Hey.

40:19.290 --> 40:20.290
Oh.

40:23.130 --> 40:24.130
You think it's real?

40:29.560 --> 40:30.560
- Sure is.

40:31.970 --> 40:33.109
- What is this?

40:33.110 --> 40:34.159
- What do you mean?

40:34.160 --> 40:35.569
- Why would somebody
come out here

40:35.570 --> 40:39.369
and leave pumpkins
and light candles?

40:39.370 --> 40:40.999
- Kids do weird shit.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.599
- Yeah, sure.

40:42.600 --> 40:45.400
Is it a coincidence that we
keep finding things near 'em?

40:47.720 --> 40:50.563
- Well, there's one
way to find out.

40:54.300 --> 40:56.649
If there's something
near that one,

40:56.650 --> 40:58.250
it's probably not a coincidence.

41:30.760 --> 41:32.319
It's gold.

41:32.320 --> 41:34.049
Over an ounce, probably.

41:34.050 --> 41:35.173
- What's that worth?

41:36.010 --> 41:37.010
- Couple thousand.

41:38.240 --> 41:40.003
- Why would anybody do this?

41:42.362 --> 41:43.939
- None of these finds
look buried, do they?

41:43.940 --> 41:45.989
- They're obviously buried.

41:45.990 --> 41:48.461
- No, but I mean, doesn't
look like someone

41:48.462 --> 41:52.441
dug a hole, dropped the
stuff and then refilled it.

41:52.442 --> 41:53.809
- No.

41:53.810 --> 41:56.009
- So that means that
they found the stuff

41:56.010 --> 41:58.339
with a detector, but
instead of digging

41:58.340 --> 42:00.403
they marked it with a pumpkin.

42:01.940 --> 42:03.749
- Why would anybody do that?

42:03.750 --> 42:04.959
- Who cares?

42:04.960 --> 42:07.929
Let's get all we can
'fore they come back.

42:07.930 --> 42:08.930
- What do you mean?

42:14.850 --> 42:15.850
What do you think?

42:20.570 --> 42:22.809
- Well, they found the stuff

42:22.810 --> 42:24.799
but they didn't dig it up.

42:24.800 --> 42:25.800
Fair game to me.

42:26.660 --> 42:28.829
- Finders keepers, right Coombs?

42:28.830 --> 42:29.830
- Way I see it.

42:32.430 --> 42:34.954
- Well it's gonna get dark soon.

42:34.955 --> 42:37.869
If we're gonna get to it,
we better get steppin.

42:37.870 --> 42:38.870
- Go.

43:04.200 --> 43:05.200
- Oh.

43:14.150 --> 43:15.833
Ah, what'd you get?

43:17.610 --> 43:19.529
- Silver certificates.

43:19.530 --> 43:20.843
- Nice.

43:30.268 --> 43:31.527
- Wow!

43:40.160 --> 43:41.213
- Hey guys?

43:43.413 --> 43:44.413
Come here.

43:52.690 --> 43:53.690
- Holy dang.

43:54.536 --> 43:55.536
- Hoowee!

44:18.470 --> 44:20.526
- We ain't got much time
till we lose the sun.

44:20.527 --> 44:23.063
Let's get to work, come on.

45:02.870 --> 45:04.020
- Is that the last one?

45:05.300 --> 45:06.300
- Looks like it.

45:32.890 --> 45:34.359
- What the?

45:34.360 --> 45:37.839
Looks like a cup or something
from the Middle Ages.

45:37.840 --> 45:40.223
- Yeah, so what is
that doing here?

45:41.210 --> 45:42.409
- What do you mean?

45:42.410 --> 45:43.789
- We didn't have
the Middle Ages.

45:43.790 --> 45:46.693
- Hah, everybody had
the Middle Ages.

45:48.143 --> 45:50.069
- You don't know much about
the Middle Ages, do you, Tom?

45:50.070 --> 45:54.019
- Yeah, sorcery, witches,
demons, black magic,

45:54.020 --> 45:55.020
that sort of thing.

45:55.021 --> 45:57.029
- The Middle Ages was in Europe.

45:57.030 --> 45:59.579
Way before America
was a country.

45:59.580 --> 46:01.683
So what is that
doing buried here?

46:02.970 --> 46:05.063
- Don't know, we'll
figure it out later.

46:06.440 --> 46:08.860
Let's just get out of here
before it's full dark.

47:09.823 --> 47:12.723
- What the hell is going on?

47:14.390 --> 47:16.553
- Well we got the headlamps.

47:16.554 --> 47:18.723
- We ain't got time to
search all those, Willie.

47:20.050 --> 47:21.300
- What do you think, Toe?

47:22.634 --> 47:24.343
Should we search some
more or go home?

47:26.650 --> 47:28.023
- I could use a new truck.

47:28.910 --> 47:30.149
- You sure you know how
to get us out of here

47:30.150 --> 47:31.529
in the dark?

47:31.530 --> 47:32.903
- It's not rocket science.

47:33.850 --> 47:34.850
I got a compass.

47:36.220 --> 47:38.793
- Well, if we're gonna do this,

47:38.794 --> 47:40.763
we best do it quick.

49:10.558 --> 49:11.725
- Biiiiig pumpkin.

49:12.750 --> 49:14.343
Biiiiig treasure.

49:26.530 --> 49:28.059
- Look at this.

49:28.060 --> 49:31.309
I think it's a gold doubloon.

49:31.310 --> 49:33.013
An honest to god doubloon.

49:34.719 --> 49:36.459
- Like in the Crimson Pirate?

49:36.460 --> 49:38.523
- Like in the damn
Crimson Pirate.

49:40.570 --> 49:44.013
- All I found was
this gold necklace.

49:50.233 --> 49:52.059
- All this stuff can't be real.

49:52.060 --> 49:53.060
- What if it is?

49:53.806 --> 49:55.406
- Then what's it doing out here?

50:03.072 --> 50:04.239
- Where's Toe?

50:05.885 --> 50:06.885
- Toe!

50:09.042 --> 50:10.042
Toe? - Toe?

50:56.282 --> 50:57.282
- Toe!

50:59.626 --> 51:01.433
- Probably off taking
a piss someplace.

51:02.800 --> 51:03.800
- Toe!

51:06.810 --> 51:09.047
- Might as well
search these last few

51:09.048 --> 51:10.569
and then take off.

51:10.570 --> 51:13.443
Still make it back to Taber's
for a couple of beers.

51:41.440 --> 51:42.640
- Nothing near this one.

51:44.463 --> 51:45.463
- Nothing?

52:41.413 --> 52:42.496
- What is it?

52:52.800 --> 52:54.003
Holy Jesus!

52:57.297 --> 52:59.093
- What happened?

53:03.410 --> 53:05.179
- Yeah, there's no
service around here.

53:05.180 --> 53:08.329
- Is it a sinkhole,
or quicksand or what?

53:08.330 --> 53:09.899
- Get your bag
Willie, we gotta go.

53:09.900 --> 53:10.840
We gotta get help.

53:10.841 --> 53:13.109
- I don't wanna leave him.

53:13.110 --> 53:14.729
- He's dead, Willie,
there's nothing we can do.

53:14.730 --> 53:16.238
Come on!

53:16.239 --> 53:17.620
Come on, let's get out of here.

53:19.720 --> 53:20.970
Forget that stuff.

53:56.807 --> 53:58.943
- I, I think it's gone.

54:00.310 --> 54:01.310
- Willie, which way?

54:03.200 --> 54:04.919
- Uh, left.

54:04.920 --> 54:06.889
Left, I think.

54:06.890 --> 54:09.159
- Willie, think about it.

54:09.160 --> 54:10.309
Which way?

54:10.310 --> 54:12.340
- Left, definitely left!

55:41.950 --> 55:43.339
- So if everybody who
makes it to the end

55:43.340 --> 55:45.279
of the Pumpkin Trail dies,

55:45.280 --> 55:46.980
how's that story
actually get out?

55:48.020 --> 55:49.020
- I'm not sure.

55:51.310 --> 55:53.143
- The picture in your
backpack, who is that?

55:54.810 --> 55:55.810
- My daughter.

55:56.825 --> 55:57.825
- Ah, how old is she?

56:00.360 --> 56:01.713
Oh, I'm sorry.

56:04.730 --> 56:05.730
- About what?

56:07.270 --> 56:09.403
- Is she dead?

56:12.770 --> 56:13.770
- No.

56:15.160 --> 56:16.173
Just far away.

56:21.109 --> 56:21.942
Oh, dammit.

56:21.942 --> 56:22.942
- What?

56:24.056 --> 56:26.299
- We're not gonna
make it out of here

56:26.300 --> 56:29.929
before sun down unless we
cross the Crybaby Bridge.

56:29.930 --> 56:31.380
- And we don't wanna do that?

56:33.060 --> 56:34.060
- No.

56:34.980 --> 56:37.619
- Can you find a safe
place for us to camp?

56:37.620 --> 56:39.529
- I think so.

56:39.530 --> 56:41.560
Nothing's 100 percent.

56:42.640 --> 56:45.290
I'll put us next to one of
the more harmless regions.

56:46.174 --> 56:47.393
- Well, lead the way.

57:01.990 --> 57:03.769
- This should be okay.

57:03.770 --> 57:05.020
- Yeah, how sure are you?

57:06.780 --> 57:07.923
- I think we're good.

57:09.593 --> 57:10.953
- You think we could
start a fire?

57:12.330 --> 57:13.330
- Yeah.

57:27.710 --> 57:30.110
So you never really told
me why you're out here.

57:32.545 --> 57:33.899
- Just exploring.

57:33.900 --> 57:37.903
I heard the stories and
I was, well, curious.

57:41.460 --> 57:42.510
You gonna start that?

57:44.450 --> 57:45.893
- Yeah, sure.

58:01.970 --> 58:06.200
Yeah, so if we head south and
skirt the Wendigo's area

58:07.190 --> 58:08.499
and then head west a little bit

58:08.500 --> 58:10.750
we should be completely
out of the Terrortory.

58:12.130 --> 58:14.780
Then our biggest problem is
getting back to our cars.

58:15.680 --> 58:16.680
- Wendigo?

58:18.880 --> 58:20.980
- A campfire story
before bed then.

59:42.349 --> 59:43.629
- That was a pretty short story.

59:43.630 --> 59:45.580
- Yeah, well they
can't all be winners.

59:48.112 --> 59:50.860
- The thing is, I have
my own story to tell.

59:57.810 --> 59:59.960
All those Midnight Clown
stories you heard.

01:00:02.007 --> 01:00:03.949
You know the one
about six people

01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:06.589
who came out to the
woods to shoot a shitty

01:00:06.590 --> 01:00:07.623
found footage movie?

01:00:11.790 --> 01:00:16.513
Three guys, three girls came
out just to shoot a movie.

01:00:18.790 --> 01:00:20.293
Saw some balloons in a tree,

01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:23.770
didn't think anything about it.

01:00:24.810 --> 01:00:25.860
- That was a warning.

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:28.649
- What?

01:00:28.650 --> 01:00:31.289
- Yeah, the balloons
were a warning.

01:00:31.290 --> 01:00:33.119
You can find them all
around the outskirts

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:35.699
of the Midnight
Clown's territory.

01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:37.425
- He warns people away?

01:00:37.426 --> 01:00:39.179
- No, he needs people to come in

01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:42.130
so he can kill them and send
one off to tell the tale, but,

01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:46.889
I think the balloons are a
warning to the other things to

01:00:46.890 --> 01:00:47.890
stay out.

01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:51.299
- I thought you said
there were buffer zones

01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:52.539
between the areas?

01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:53.540
- Yeah there are.

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:56.279
But if some of these things
can cross boundaries,

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:57.980
and they can because
I've seen it,

01:00:59.270 --> 01:01:00.829
what happens when they do?

01:01:00.830 --> 01:01:03.969
For instance what
happens if Smiling Jack

01:01:03.970 --> 01:01:06.349
crosses the Crybaby Bridge?

01:01:06.350 --> 01:01:10.739
More importantly, if they
can cross boundaries,

01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:12.823
what's keeping them
IN the Terrortory?

01:01:13.930 --> 01:01:15.180
- Let me finish my story.

01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:18.693
Then, if you wanna run
theories past me.

01:01:22.827 --> 01:01:25.079
Anyway, six of them
saw the balloons

01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:26.080
and kept going.

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:29.769
They camped that night, decided
to get up in the morning

01:01:29.770 --> 01:01:30.770
and make a movie.

01:01:32.830 --> 01:01:33.830
Night fell.

01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:37.690
By morning only one of them
walked out of the woods alive.

01:01:39.410 --> 01:01:40.749
The girl who walked
out, her name was Laura

01:01:40.750 --> 01:01:41.839
and she wanted to be an actor

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:44.023
but she killed herself
six months later.

01:01:45.570 --> 01:01:49.223
Another girl was Tammy. The
clown strangled her to death.

01:01:50.687 --> 01:01:54.323
The other girl was
Darla Marie Prengaman.

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.593
She was a wild spirit.

01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:02.893
She liked scuba diving,
hiking, skiing.

01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:05.910
Anything new she wanted
to try, you know?

01:02:11.970 --> 01:02:13.623
Her smile was so infectious.

01:02:16.650 --> 01:02:17.743
She was my future.

01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:21.440
She was my everything.

01:02:25.070 --> 01:02:26.823
- So you're here for revenge.

01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:32.123
- I'm here to find
out what happened.

01:02:34.686 --> 01:02:35.686
And yeah.

01:02:36.892 --> 01:02:38.499
Yeah, revenge would be cool.

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:40.927
- But you know what happened.

01:02:40.928 --> 01:02:42.469
- Do I?

01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:45.189
In the footage they
found, she ran off.

01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:46.190
Never found a body.

01:02:49.671 --> 01:02:51.093
You think she's still alive?

01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:53.680
- I don't think so.

01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:55.750
- See?

01:02:56.610 --> 01:02:57.610
That wasn't a no.

01:02:58.770 --> 01:03:01.369
- Yeah well I don't think
that gun is gonna hurt it.

01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:03.099
- You ever seen it shot?

01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:04.469
- No.

01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:05.470
- Then...

01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:12.773
Ah, relax, it's okay.

01:03:14.311 --> 01:03:15.549
- What the hell are they?

01:03:15.550 --> 01:03:17.720
- Rainbow firelights,
some call them.

01:03:18.570 --> 01:03:20.843
Will-o-the-Wisps,
Lightning Sprites.

01:03:23.828 --> 01:03:26.713
I even heard one person call
them Skittles Fireflies.

01:03:27.735 --> 01:03:29.153
It's okay, they're harmless.

01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:38.499
- Tomorrow, I want
you to take me

01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:40.859
to the Midnight
Clown's territory.

01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:42.459
- I'm not going in
there with you.

01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:44.099
- I don't want you to.

01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:46.469
If I go in there alone
he can't hurt me, right?

01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:50.203
But... maybe I can hurt him.

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:54.520
- Okay.

01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:02.910
End up being another
couple of missing kids.

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:07.813
I used to feel bad, tried to
stop everyone I came across.

01:04:09.804 --> 01:04:12.359
They kept going off.

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:15.529
The thing is, if I could
get this information out,

01:04:15.530 --> 01:04:16.973
maybe it'll save lives.

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:22.180
People need to stop coming here.

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:24.950
They need to stop dying here.

01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:28.013
You know, I don't
think I was wrong

01:04:28.014 --> 01:04:31.719
about where Smiling Jack
was supposed to stop.

01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:33.269
- Yeah, you must have been.

01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:34.879
- Nope.

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:39.719
Smiling Jack's domain
is growing larger.

01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:42.029
Not by much, but it's
definitely getting bigger.

01:04:42.030 --> 01:04:43.619
If that means what
I think it means,

01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:45.869
we have to stop people from
coming here at all costs.

01:04:45.870 --> 01:04:47.749
- What do you think it means?

01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:49.253
- The Terrortory's
growing larger.

01:04:51.130 --> 01:04:52.730
That's why it lures people here.

01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:58.399
Every time it takes
a life, it grows.

01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:59.400
- Aiden.

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:24.082
- Now listen to me.

01:05:24.083 --> 01:05:25.349
This is important.

01:05:25.350 --> 01:05:27.849
They're gonna pass us, and
then they're gonna turn around

01:05:27.850 --> 01:05:29.039
and follow us.

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:30.579
Do not look back at them.

01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:33.153
No matter what they do,
no matter what they say.

01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:35.189
- Okay, what the
hell's going on?

01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:36.879
- Just stare at the
back of my head

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:38.280
until I say different, okay?

01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:40.200
- If you tell me
what's going on,

01:05:40.201 --> 01:05:42.039
- Do you wanna see
the Midnight Clown?

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:43.043
- Yes.

01:05:43.044 --> 01:05:44.759
- Do you wanna die
a horrible death?

01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:45.760
- No.

01:05:46.484 --> 01:05:47.817
- Then trust me.

01:06:02.191 --> 01:06:03.989
Hello.

01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:05.579
- Hello.

01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:06.930
- Nice day for a hike, huh?

01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:09.010
- We're just wandering.

01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:13.653
- Well, have at it.

01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:16.140
Goodbye.

01:06:20.191 --> 01:06:21.024
- Can we come with you?

01:06:21.025 --> 01:06:23.109
- Do not look back.

01:06:23.110 --> 01:06:24.633
Suit yourself, girls.

01:06:29.530 --> 01:06:30.730
- Why don't you like us?

01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:32.933
- We like you fine.

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:35.000
- You don't act like it.

01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:38.290
Why doesn't the other one talk?

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:40.160
- I talk.

01:06:41.151 --> 01:06:42.469
- Do you like us?

01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:43.470
- Sure.

01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:46.139
- Do you think we're pretty?

01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:47.140
- Yeah, sure.

01:06:48.271 --> 01:06:51.039
- Which one of us
is the prettiest?

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:52.649
- We think you're
all equally pretty.

01:06:52.650 --> 01:06:53.900
- We asked the other one.

01:06:55.030 --> 01:06:57.049
- I was gonna say the
same thing he did.

01:06:57.050 --> 01:06:58.763
- We can't all be
equally pretty.

01:06:59.890 --> 01:07:00.923
- We think you are.

01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:04.373
- Oh my god, what's that?

01:07:05.528 --> 01:07:06.899
- Wait.

01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:08.003
Let's keep moving.

01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:11.443
Whatever it is won't bother us.

01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:17.530
- You're being very rude.

01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:21.049
- I don't think he
likes us at all.

01:07:21.050 --> 01:07:23.380
- You should be nice
to us, or else.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.689
I'm going to shoot you
in the back of the head

01:07:27.690 --> 01:07:28.890
if you don't look at us.

01:07:33.732 --> 01:07:35.232
I said look at us!

01:07:36.086 --> 01:07:37.410
- Keep walking.

01:07:37.411 --> 01:07:39.161
- They've got my gun.

01:07:46.990 --> 01:07:48.251
- Look at us.

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:52.863
- Just a second,
we'll take a look.

01:07:58.520 --> 01:07:59.950
Just a minute.

01:07:59.951 --> 01:08:02.527
- You're both going to die.

01:08:02.528 --> 01:08:05.808
You're going to die and we're
going to eat your bones.

01:08:06.641 --> 01:08:07.641
- No.

01:08:18.027 --> 01:08:19.779
- What the fuck was that?

01:08:19.779 --> 01:08:21.193
- The Gaze of the Beholder.

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:24.118
- Yeah, and what
the fuck is that?

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:25.983
- You're lucky we
made it far enough.

01:08:27.045 --> 01:08:29.045
If you'd have looked
back any earlier...

01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:36.049
No, no, no, no.

01:08:36.050 --> 01:08:38.050
Grab a big stick and
pull it toward you.

01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:08.450
Come on, you wanna
hear another story?

01:09:09.609 --> 01:09:12.408
- How much longer until the
Midnight Clown's territory?

01:09:12.410 --> 01:09:13.410
- About two hours.

01:09:14.899 --> 01:09:16.082
- All right, why not?

01:09:29.415 --> 01:09:30.412
- Morning.

01:09:30.412 --> 01:09:31.413
- Morning.

01:09:31.415 --> 01:09:33.069
- Morning.

01:09:33.069 --> 01:09:34.243
- You forgot to shave.

01:09:49.170 --> 01:09:50.220
- It'll be all right.

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:01.819
No, I want what she's got.

01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:03.520
- Nope, you need
to eat healthier.

01:10:06.267 --> 01:10:09.789
- Hello, Fruity Pebbles?

01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:10.890
- Eat your grapefruit.

01:10:15.690 --> 01:10:17.999
Oh, and don't put
any sugar on it.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.363
Defeats the purpose.

01:10:22.992 --> 01:10:24.549
- Don't laugh.

01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:25.900
You'll get old someday too.

01:10:27.490 --> 01:10:30.479
- Oh, the Donovans are having
a birthday party for Nora

01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:32.949
and they're taking some
kids camping tonight.

01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:34.219
Carly's been invited.

01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:35.492
- Camping?

01:10:35.493 --> 01:10:37.669
- Yeah, it's where
people go into the woods

01:10:37.670 --> 01:10:41.773
and they sleep in tents and
become one with nature.

01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:46.059
- Do me a favor, don't
grow up to be a smartass

01:10:46.060 --> 01:10:47.389
like your mom, okay?

01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:48.448
- Robert!

01:10:48.449 --> 01:10:49.649
- Ooh.

01:10:49.650 --> 01:10:51.990
- What, ass is not a bad word.

01:10:51.991 --> 01:10:53.945
It's a donkey.

01:10:56.530 --> 01:11:00.390
You wanna go camping,
in the woods?

01:11:00.391 --> 01:11:01.639
- Mhmm.

01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:04.949
- With ticks and
snakes and stuff?

01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:05.950
- Yes.

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:08.809
- Where are they going?

01:11:08.810 --> 01:11:10.810
- Just to the woods
on the edge of town.

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:16.909
- I mean, if she
wants to go and.

01:11:16.910 --> 01:11:20.100
Marty's gonna be
chaperoning, sure.

01:11:20.101 --> 01:11:21.259
- Yes!

01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:22.559
- Better eat that
fast and get going,

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:23.500
don't wanna be late for court.

01:11:23.501 --> 01:11:25.173
- No, it's gross.

01:11:29.839 --> 01:11:30.839
Mwah.

01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:40.303
- Don't stop at
McDonalds on the way.

01:11:41.890 --> 01:11:43.873
- When did you get
psychic powers?

01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:04.703
I'm home!

01:12:06.190 --> 01:12:07.683
Victorious!

01:12:08.910 --> 01:12:10.403
Not guilty.

01:12:13.044 --> 01:12:17.053
Okay, okay, probation before
judgment, same thing.

01:12:19.370 --> 01:12:20.370
Hello?

01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:16.660
Hello?

01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:17.660
- Robert?

01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:19.750
- How's camping?

01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:21.869
- Robert, you're breaking up.

01:13:21.870 --> 01:13:23.620
The reception is
terrible out here.

01:13:25.210 --> 01:13:26.259
Robert?

01:13:26.260 --> 01:13:28.039
- Hold on a second.

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:29.317
- Robert.

01:13:29.318 --> 01:13:30.151
- Is it better here?

01:13:30.152 --> 01:13:31.759
- Something's wrong out here.

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:33.393
- What, what did you say?

01:13:34.377 --> 01:13:35.459
- Can you still hear me?

01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:36.860
I only caught a word or two.

01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:39.429
- I can hear you, yeah.

01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:40.430
Can you hear me?

01:13:41.150 --> 01:13:44.449
- If you can hear me, I think
we're coming back now.

01:13:44.450 --> 01:13:46.809
I don't wanna be
out here anymore.

01:13:46.810 --> 01:13:47.643
We're gonna leave now.

01:13:47.644 --> 01:13:48.829
We should be back in an hour.

01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:49.720
- What's going on?

01:13:49.721 --> 01:13:51.375
- Hello?

01:13:51.376 --> 01:13:52.209
Oh god.

01:13:52.209 --> 01:13:53.042
I hope you can still hear me.

01:13:53.043 --> 01:13:55.199
Look, if we're not
back in an hour,

01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:57.909
I don't know, maybe
I'm overreacting.

01:13:57.910 --> 01:13:59.409
But I think you should
call the police.

01:13:59.410 --> 01:14:00.469
- Brenda.

01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:03.269
- Tell them we're right
off Picnic Woods Road.

01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:04.799
Our cars are on the shoulder.

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:06.789
An SUV and my car.

01:14:06.790 --> 01:14:09.634
Tell them we're in the woods
about a quarter mile.

01:14:09.635 --> 01:14:10.996
- Brenda, what's wrong?

01:14:10.997 --> 01:14:14.399
- God, I hope you can hear me.

01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:15.920
I love you, Robert.

01:14:15.921 --> 01:14:20.800
- Brenda!

01:14:20.801 --> 01:14:22.838
Shit.

01:14:22.839 --> 01:14:23.839
Shit.

01:16:31.766 --> 01:16:35.045
Brenda!

01:16:35.046 --> 01:16:36.046
Brenda!

01:16:53.592 --> 01:16:54.592
Carly!

01:17:17.741 --> 01:17:18.741
Brenda!

01:17:20.077 --> 01:17:21.077
Carly!

01:17:52.858 --> 01:17:53.858
Brenda.

01:17:56.344 --> 01:17:57.344
Carly.

01:19:06.665 --> 01:19:07.665
Ugh.

01:19:27.953 --> 01:19:28.953
Brenda.

01:19:33.645 --> 01:19:35.827
Brenda, where's Carly?

01:19:51.213 --> 01:19:52.733
Brenda, where's Carly?

01:20:00.492 --> 01:20:01.903
- Who are you?

01:20:05.090 --> 01:20:09.484
- What is this?

01:20:09.485 --> 01:20:10.839
- This?

01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:12.963
This is but a Mad Gathering.

01:20:26.246 --> 01:20:29.622
But you, who are you to
wander in amongst us

01:20:29.623 --> 01:20:31.963
and still retain your sanity?

01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:34.480
- Brenda.

01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:36.620
Come here.

01:20:38.210 --> 01:20:41.525
- All of your kind who have
wandered into our gathering

01:20:41.526 --> 01:20:43.779
have been driven mad.

01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:46.343
Why not then you?

01:20:55.237 --> 01:20:57.979
I will make you this offer.

01:20:57.980 --> 01:21:00.609
Use your weapon, and
if you injure me,

01:21:00.610 --> 01:21:02.683
all of you go free.

01:21:30.190 --> 01:21:32.453
I will make you another offer.

01:21:33.368 --> 01:21:35.219
If you choose your
wife or your daughter,

01:21:35.220 --> 01:21:38.513
I will let her leave with you.

01:21:38.514 --> 01:21:41.360
But you agree that
the other is mine.

01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:45.310
- No.

01:21:51.370 --> 01:21:55.093
- Choose one for you
and one for me.

01:21:56.035 --> 01:21:58.563
Or you will all perish.

01:22:04.150 --> 01:22:05.333
- Let them both go.

01:22:06.172 --> 01:22:08.319
- You find the choice
too difficult?

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:10.229
- Yes!

01:22:10.230 --> 01:22:11.303
- I will simplify it.

01:22:19.754 --> 01:22:24.754
What good is a woman
without a tongue?

01:22:26.585 --> 01:22:27.585
- No!

01:22:33.443 --> 01:22:34.443
- Choose.

01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:38.500
- Brenda.

01:22:43.423 --> 01:22:44.840
- What about now?

01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:53.513
Certainly, now the
choice is simple.

01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:57.013
Choose.

01:22:57.013 --> 01:22:58.013
- No.

01:22:58.806 --> 01:23:00.284
- Choose.

01:23:00.285 --> 01:23:01.285
- I can't!

01:23:02.260 --> 01:23:03.989
- Then we have no bargain.

01:23:03.990 --> 01:23:04.990
- NO!

01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:16.633
- What do you have
to offer me now?

01:23:21.804 --> 01:23:23.303
- What do you want?

01:23:25.569 --> 01:23:26.819
- Serve me.

01:23:26.820 --> 01:23:28.349
- What?

01:23:28.350 --> 01:23:31.649
- Do all that I ask
until the end of time

01:23:31.650 --> 01:23:33.839
and your daughter will go free.

01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:37.167
This night will seem but a
sinister dream she once had.

01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:43.000
- What will you ask of me?

01:23:44.420 --> 01:23:45.420
- Choose.

01:23:52.689 --> 01:23:53.753
Choose!

01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:56.319
- All right.

01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:57.320
- You agree?

01:23:58.630 --> 01:23:59.679
- Yes.

01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:00.930
- Then give me your hand.

01:24:32.710 --> 01:24:33.710
- I love you, baby.

01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:35.660
I love you.

01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:52.940
- Now you will join
our Mad Gathering.

01:24:55.510 --> 01:24:57.104
- So what happened to him?

01:24:57.105 --> 01:24:57.938
- I don't know.

01:24:57.939 --> 01:25:01.239
Some stories say he wanders
doing the Terrortory's bidding.

01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:03.490
Others say they ripped
him apart and ate him.

01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:06.189
We're here.

01:25:06.190 --> 01:25:07.190
- Huh?

01:25:08.284 --> 01:25:09.889
- This is where the
Midnight Clown is.

01:25:09.890 --> 01:25:12.320
- The hell, man, you weren't
supposed to come back here!

01:25:12.321 --> 01:25:14.609
- No, it's okay.

01:25:14.610 --> 01:25:16.059
He doesn't come out
till after midnight.

01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:17.060
The rules, remember?

01:25:18.270 --> 01:25:20.720
As long as I'm clear of
here by dark, we're fine.

01:25:21.710 --> 01:25:23.383
- Well I appreciate
you bringing me here.

01:25:24.521 --> 01:25:25.380
- Are you sure you
wanna do this?

01:25:25.381 --> 01:25:27.189
There's no guarantees out here.

01:25:27.190 --> 01:25:29.039
He could still kill you.

01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:30.190
- I'll take the chance.

01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:32.823
It was good meeting you, Aiden.

01:25:36.050 --> 01:25:39.029
- Now I'll wait for you outside
the bounds until morning.

01:25:39.030 --> 01:25:40.629
When you're done, come
back past this tree

01:25:40.630 --> 01:25:43.030
and keep straight on the
trail until you see me.

01:25:44.625 --> 01:25:45.580
- You don't have to wait.

01:25:45.581 --> 01:25:48.343
- Without me, you won't make
it out of these woods alive.

01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:52.809
- Thanks man, but don't
wait past morning.

01:25:52.810 --> 01:25:54.719
If I'm not on the
trail by first light,

01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:55.720
I'm not coming.

01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:58.280
- Good luck.

01:26:33.305 --> 01:26:34.305
- Come out!

01:26:35.150 --> 01:26:36.150
It's midnight!

01:27:19.483 --> 01:27:22.369
The fuck are you smiling about?

01:27:22.370 --> 01:27:23.383
Only one leaves?

01:27:26.150 --> 01:27:27.253
I'm the only one here.

01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:32.120
What?

01:27:55.198 --> 01:27:57.893
Stupid son of a bitch.

01:28:02.590 --> 01:28:03.590
- Shoot him!

01:28:04.990 --> 01:28:06.439
- Who the hell are you?

01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:07.609
- It's the Midnight Clown, man,

01:28:07.610 --> 01:28:08.793
shoot the motherfucker!

01:28:51.101 --> 01:28:52.934
- Do you remember her?

01:28:58.059 --> 01:28:59.142
Is she alive?

01:29:06.460 --> 01:29:07.829
Her name was Darla.

01:29:07.830 --> 01:29:09.299
She was beautiful,
she was funny,

01:29:09.300 --> 01:29:10.550
she was everything to me.

01:29:13.718 --> 01:29:15.383
And you, you took her away.

01:29:19.698 --> 01:29:21.089
I know.

01:29:21.090 --> 01:29:22.207
Only one leaves.

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:34.540
I hope this hurts.

01:31:08.260 --> 01:31:09.593
- Go go!

01:31:22.534 --> 01:31:23.531
- Run!

01:31:23.531 --> 01:31:24.531
Run to me!

01:31:26.715 --> 01:31:27.715
- Come on.

01:31:29.235 --> 01:31:30.235
- Go!

01:31:40.606 --> 01:31:42.905
Chase.

01:31:42.906 --> 01:31:43.908
- Run to me!

01:31:43.909 --> 01:31:44.742
Run!

01:31:44.742 --> 01:31:45.742
- Help me!

01:31:47.616 --> 01:31:48.949
- This way, run!

01:31:49.856 --> 01:31:50.856
Run to me!

01:31:52.154 --> 01:31:53.154
- Help me!

01:31:58.314 --> 01:32:01.731
Please, no.

01:32:03.573 --> 01:32:08.573
Please, please.

01:32:23.093 --> 01:32:28.093
Please, please.

01:34:41.170 --> 01:34:44.379
- These things, why are
they all so homicidal?

01:34:44.380 --> 01:34:45.619
- They're not.

01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:47.879
Not all of them are malevolent.

01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:49.480
- Do all that I ask
till the end of time

01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:53.839
and your daughter will go free.

01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:55.279
- So what happened to him?

01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:58.280
- Some stories say he wanders
doing the Terrortory's bidding.

01:34:59.296 --> 01:35:00.596
- What will you ask of me?

01:35:01.460 --> 01:35:02.460
- Serve me.
