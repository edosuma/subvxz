00:25.517 --> 00:26.517
Another?

00:34.283 --> 00:35.513
Vodka tonic.

00:40.182 --> 00:43.047
So, you think LA is going
all the way this year?

00:43.048 --> 00:45.278
Doesn't really matter.

00:45.548 --> 00:48.345
New York got knocked out in the
first fucking round by Jersey, so...

00:48.346 --> 00:50.479
Yeah, I know... Didn't even win a game.

00:50.480 --> 00:51.480
Sad.

00:53.479 --> 00:55.349
You from out east?

00:55.546 --> 00:58.344
Cheering for New York,
you gotta be from out east.

00:58.345 --> 00:59.755
Staten Island.

01:00.478 --> 01:01.478
Ah, yeah.

01:02.478 --> 01:03.478
L.A.

01:04.510 --> 01:06.190
Well... Thanks...

01:06.510 --> 01:08.509
Anaheim. Close enough.

01:08.510 --> 01:10.508
Texas, though. Jesus Christ.

01:10.509 --> 01:12.508
Sick of this place already.

01:12.509 --> 01:14.508
Been waiting 2 hours
for this OKC flight.

01:14.509 --> 01:18.839
It's like 4 hours for
a 20 minute flight.

01:19.841 --> 01:22.706
You know, when I sat down...

01:22.707 --> 01:24.839
I was afraid you'd be
rooting for San Antonio...

01:24.840 --> 01:26.340
Oklahoma City?!

01:26.840 --> 01:28.806
Yeah, that's the one.

01:28.807 --> 01:30.447
Hmmmm, you, too?

01:32.372 --> 01:33.692
Yeah, well...

01:34.505 --> 01:36.504
Guess I'll see you on the flight.

01:36.505 --> 01:37.505
Guess so.

01:42.837 --> 01:43.837
Come on.

02:24.129 --> 02:29.628
Running it again isn't going to
help. It's saying it's declined.

02:29.629 --> 02:35.593
That's... That's impossible. I
have over $2,000 in that account.

02:35.594 --> 02:40.738
No, I have. I don't have anything... I,
um... You're gonna have to run it again.

02:40.739 --> 02:43.596
There's no... Yeah, I
don't have any options.

02:45.526 --> 02:46.526
Here.

02:47.526 --> 02:49.524
Oh, you don't have to do that.

02:49.525 --> 02:51.524
I was gonna rent a car anyway,
and we're going to the same place.

02:51.525 --> 02:53.524
Don't worry about it.

02:53.525 --> 02:55.523
Okay, well, thank you.

02:55.524 --> 02:57.024
Oh... "Morris".

02:57.524 --> 02:58.524
Thanks.

02:59.524 --> 03:01.522
Alright, here's your card.

03:01.523 --> 03:03.983
Here's your broken card.

03:05.456 --> 03:08.416
Have a safe trip or whatever.

03:08.688 --> 03:09.688
I will.

03:21.453 --> 03:23.751
Yeah, I was at Rent OK...

03:23.752 --> 03:25.851
And they declined my card...

03:25.852 --> 03:27.850
I had them run it through again.

03:27.851 --> 03:29.850
I've had problems
with the stripe before.

03:29.851 --> 03:32.116
But she said it was an actual "decline."

03:32.117 --> 03:36.116
I should have at least $2,000 in there.

03:36.117 --> 03:37.897
Yeah, I can hold.

03:42.482 --> 03:47.402
No, I know for a fact
there's at least $2000...

08:30.630 --> 08:32.763
Did you try what I told you.

08:32.764 --> 08:33.813
last time?

08:39.029 --> 08:40.029
Sort of.

08:42.628 --> 08:44.760
We keep trying stuff...

08:44.761 --> 08:46.901
Or, not trying stuff.

08:49.893 --> 08:52.026
I just want to help...

08:52.027 --> 08:54.487
And, I don't understand.

08:57.559 --> 09:00.289
What do you not understand?

09:02.225 --> 09:03.225
Well...

09:05.691 --> 09:08.123
We've been together 3 years.

09:08.124 --> 09:12.055
And it's not... It's
not always this bad.

09:12.056 --> 09:14.588
Sometimes whenever I touch her.

09:14.589 --> 09:16.639
It feels like she...

09:16.723 --> 09:19.288
She things I'm trying...
I'm going to hurt her.

09:19.289 --> 09:21.420
And I don't understand.

09:21.421 --> 09:26.431
Hurting her is the last
thing that I want to do.

09:27.287 --> 09:28.287
Ada...

09:31.287 --> 09:33.552
What's it like for you.

09:33.553 --> 09:35.963
Hearing Calvin say that?

09:36.518 --> 09:37.568
That he...

09:38.618 --> 09:41.184
He doesn't want to hurt you.

09:41.185 --> 09:42.185
Good.

09:44.751 --> 09:45.801
Just good?

09:48.284 --> 09:49.284
Yeah.

09:50.416 --> 09:51.416
I000

09:52.416 --> 09:53.836
I don't know.

09:54.415 --> 09:56.965
Can you be more specific?

09:57.681 --> 09:58.731
Does it...

10:00.214 --> 10:03.854
Make you sad... when he touches you?

10:04.680 --> 10:05.680
Or...

10:07.180 --> 10:09.279
Does it make you mad?

10:09.280 --> 10:10.280
OranQYY?

10:13.012 --> 10:14.062
Or scared?

10:18.745 --> 10:20.435
What does it do?

11:05.270 --> 11:07.935
I just wish he could read my mind...

11:07.936 --> 11:10.486
Saying it makes it worse.

11:12.269 --> 11:14.866
I just wish you could get it.

11:14.867 --> 11:17.766
It's like this cloud of bad stuff.

11:17.767 --> 11:20.777
It's around you all the time.

11:21.167 --> 11:23.266
And it has nothing to do with you...

11:23.267 --> 11:24.727
Or the person.

11:25.266 --> 11:26.956
It's just there.

11:27.266 --> 11:29.816
And it's following you...

11:30.832 --> 11:33.742
Sometimes it creates a storm.

11:38.264 --> 11:41.574
Some psychologists believe that...

11:43.530 --> 11:45.661
Things that happen to you as a child...

11:45.662 --> 11:48.032
Or, even in the womb...

11:49.195 --> 11:51.327
Stick with you, and...

11:51.328 --> 11:54.198
Play out later in your life.

11:56.194 --> 12:02.194
I was reading the other day about this
little girl that had been molested.

12:03.259 --> 12:05.991
By the time she got home...

12:05.992 --> 12:10.812
She couldn't remember
what had happened to her.

12:11.391 --> 12:13.671
I couldn't believe it.

12:14.691 --> 12:20.191
But there's... There's
something about the human mind.

12:24.422 --> 12:28.742
Some memories are just
to painful to keep.

12:29.255 --> 12:30.255
Well...

12:31.387 --> 12:32.707
Within reach.

12:39.486 --> 12:43.217
Does any of this mean anything for you?

12:43.218 --> 12:45.178
Do you think you...

12:48.751 --> 12:53.021
Might be trying to
not remember something?

12:54.250 --> 12:55.250
No...

12:57.383 --> 13:00.415
I don't remember a
lot of things, though.

13:00.416 --> 13:04.981
It's just never been in my
head, so I would answer TI TI HO.

13:04.982 --> 13:07.080
You don't remember a lot of things?

13:07.081 --> 13:09.361
About being a kid? No.

13:10.414 --> 13:11.734
I remember...

13:12.547 --> 13:14.545
Every second of childhood.

13:14.546 --> 13:15.636
Everything.

13:17.079 --> 13:20.577
I remember when I was in
third grade there was this...

13:20.578 --> 13:22.711
Popular kid who had lost his bird.

13:22.712 --> 13:26.246
And I wanted to be cool... Or
whatever. So I told him I had found it.

13:26.281 --> 13:30.851
He got really excited.
And... and, he liked me.

13:30.886 --> 13:35.421
When I went home, his
parents had called my parents

13:35.422 --> 13:39.866
and they were so happy. But I
didn't have it, so... whenever...

13:39.901 --> 13:43.233
I had to get driven over to this trailer

13:43.234 --> 13:48.200
and apologize to this crying
kid. That I had just crushed.

13:48.473 --> 13:50.793
Jeremy... was his name.

13:52.539 --> 13:55.071
Shuhhhh... Childhood was fucking agony.

13:55.072 --> 13:57.902
I don't remember any of it.

14:01.004 --> 14:03.969
Do you have any videos
you could watch...

14:03.970 --> 14:07.004
Or photo albums that
you could look through?

14:09.304 --> 14:12.002
Maybe those would, you
know... spark some memories?

14:12.003 --> 14:14.634
I have pictures from
when I was a kid, yeah.

14:14.635 --> 14:16.325
Why don't you...

14:16.802 --> 14:18.262
Call your mom.

14:18.801 --> 14:20.581
Ask her about it.

14:20.801 --> 14:22.800
Or talk to your brother
since you trust him.

14:22.801 --> 14:28.801
And, maybe they would remember
if something bad happened to you.

14:43.797 --> 14:45.962
Hey, I found a picture of
me and Jay in a Power Wheels.

14:45.963 --> 14:48.229
He's wearing over-alls.

14:48.230 --> 14:50.361
I think I found the “horrible thing."

14:50.362 --> 14:51.362
Maybe.

14:51.995 --> 14:53.994
Did you call him yet?

14:53.995 --> 14:54.995
No.

14:56.994 --> 14:59.127
I'm not gonna talk to my brother about.

14:59.128 --> 15:00.960
Being molested or whatever.

15:00.961 --> 15:01.961
Why not?

15:03.060 --> 15:05.620
I don't... I don't know.

15:06.227 --> 15:08.358
Did you call your mom yet?

15:08.359 --> 15:09.359
No.

15:10.792 --> 15:12.991
I don't want to get in trouble.

15:12.992 --> 15:14.592
I don't want...

15:15.058 --> 15:18.208
I don't want her to get upset.

15:18.658 --> 15:23.455
I never figured out a way to
talk to her about stuff like that.

15:23.456 --> 15:25.555
How do you spell it again?

15:25.556 --> 15:26.556
Sheol?

15:27.189 --> 15:28.189
Yeah.

15:28.290 --> 15:29.290
SHEOL...

15:31.188 --> 15:32.188
Oklahoma.

15:33.188 --> 15:35.320
Wouldn't that be she-ole?

15:35.321 --> 15:36.741
I don't know.

15:37.288 --> 15:39.120
People say things a
lot of different ways.

15:39.121 --> 15:41.819
Like, we say "guad a
loop“ for“Guadalupe."

15:41.820 --> 15:43.550
Whatever you say.

15:47.452 --> 15:49.222
Sheol, Oklahoma...

15:49.852 --> 15:51.984
You're not going to find
anything Googling it.

15:51.985 --> 15:53.117
I already tried.

15:53.118 --> 15:55.117
The only things that come up are...

15:55.118 --> 15:56.483
A picture of a church...

15:56.484 --> 15:57.624
And... a...

15:59.883 --> 16:03.282
The arrest record of my uncle for
selling pot and trying to stab someone.

16:03.283 --> 16:04.283
Jesus.

16:04.782 --> 16:07.514
I think he's actually
the one who got stabbed.

16:07.515 --> 16:08.655
Ohhh kay...

16:11.714 --> 16:13.980
It's like a population
of 60 or something.

16:13.981 --> 16:15.648
- 73.
- 73...

16:16.947 --> 16:20.277
Yeah, there's not a lot on here.

16:24.312 --> 16:28.002
Hey, here's me dressed as a cowgirl.

16:30.511 --> 16:31.511
<i>HEY".</i>

16:34.510 --> 16:37.509
It's only like 6 hours from Austin.

16:37.510 --> 16:39.650
Like... 6 and change.

16:40.043 --> 16:42.323
We should go up there.

16:42.542 --> 16:44.641
See if it helps. See if...

16:44.642 --> 16:46.822
You remember anything.

16:48.675 --> 16:51.933
I don't want to go to
Oklahoma. If I'm going to drive

16:51.934 --> 16:55.373
6 hours to some place, I want
it to be some place I like.

16:55.374 --> 16:58.605
Well, we gotta do something, don't we?

16:58.606 --> 16:59.606
Yeah...

17:01.839 --> 17:02.839
I mean...

17:05.038 --> 17:07.204
If you don't want to talk to anybody...

17:07.204 --> 17:09.303
And, you don't want
to go anywhere-

17:09.304 --> 17:10.674
No, I know...

17:12.637 --> 17:13.637
Listen...

17:16.270 --> 17:19.501
We'll... Make a big road trip out of it.

17:19.502 --> 17:21.667
We'll... Pack stuff for a picnic.

17:21.669 --> 17:22.669
Just go.

17:23.701 --> 17:26.031
We'll make it a thing.

17:26.201 --> 17:28.333
Do you really want to go to Oklahoma?

17:28.334 --> 17:29.524
I love you.

17:30.301 --> 17:32.401
I just want to help.

17:32.500 --> 17:36.665
Worst case scenario: We
go to some shitty place...

17:36.666 --> 17:40.531
And we'll find out that the worst
things that happened to you...

17:40.532 --> 17:44.352
Were church, and... and a knife fight.

17:44.698 --> 17:46.830
And, then... We'll look for
answers somewhere else, right?

17:46.831 --> 17:47.831
I guess.

17:50.930 --> 17:52.890
Where will we stay?

17:54.763 --> 17:57.995
No idea. No plans, whatsoever. Just fun.

17:57.996 --> 18:00.127
And you promise we'll have fun?

18:00.128 --> 18:02.818
We will have the most fun!

18:03.195 --> 18:06.360
And you won't let anyone stab me?

18:06.361 --> 18:09.731
They would have to stab me first.

18:44.420 --> 18:48.485
Did you really tell a sad
boy that you had his lost pet?

18:48.486 --> 18:49.486
Yeah...

18:50.119 --> 18:51.119
I did.

18:51.686 --> 18:52.686
Um...

18:55.518 --> 19:00.258
I guess I was kind of
a total asshole to him.

19:00.351 --> 19:06.016
I learned a valuable lesson
about lying and decency that day.

19:06.017 --> 19:09.349
Probably the second biggest
regret in my entire life.

19:09.350 --> 19:11.040
What's number 1?

19:12.116 --> 19:15.346
Uh, not dancing with the Smurfs.

19:15.581 --> 19:17.451
I'm sorry... what?

19:19.448 --> 19:22.171
Whenever I was a kid... Uh... my family

19:22.172 --> 19:25.312
took me to this amusement
park in Cincinnati.

19:25.313 --> 19:29.308
And, uh... They had this
big Smurfs stage show

19:29.309 --> 19:33.644
where guys in Smurfs mascot
costumes danced around

19:33.645 --> 19:36.789
and, uh, did songs and shit on stage.

19:37.111 --> 19:38.944
- Okay...
- Um...

19:40.002 --> 19:44.166
And, at the end, whenever
the Smurfs were done

19:44.167 --> 19:47.444
kicking Gargamel's ass or whatever...

19:47.942 --> 19:50.108
They invited everybody up
on stage to dance with them.

19:50.109 --> 19:51.109
Um...

19:51.909 --> 19:55.039
And, so they were all like
"hey kids do you want to come up

19:55.040 --> 19:57.909
and dance with us and have
fun and not be sad and shit."

19:58.140 --> 20:00.240
And you didn't dance?

20:00.241 --> 20:02.161
No. I... I didn't.

20:02.306 --> 20:03.906
I didn't dance.

20:04.240 --> 20:06.305
Uh, I'm... I'm probably
remembering it as worse than it was.

20:06.306 --> 20:08.176
But, in my head...

20:08.739 --> 20:10.904
An entire auditorium of
a whole bunch of kids...

20:10.905 --> 20:14.670
Like a thousand kids and
their fucking happy families...

20:14.671 --> 20:17.569
Rush the stage and they all go
up and they dance with the Smurfs.

20:17.570 --> 20:21.935
And, they dance and hug and
do the fucking Charleston.

20:21.936 --> 20:24.069
Meanwhile, me and my
dad are just sitting.

20:24.070 --> 20:26.401
We are the last people
left in the stadium seats.

20:26.402 --> 20:28.634
And my dad... my dad
turns to me and says...

20:28.635 --> 20:31.601
“Cal, do you want to go dance?"

20:31.602 --> 20:34.432
And, I was just... I was 6.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.932
And I was learning what
being embarrassed was...

20:36.933 --> 20:38.533
So, I say "no."

20:40.333 --> 20:43.831
But, immediately, I knew I meant "yes."

20:43.832 --> 20:46.664
Because of course I do. Of course I
want to fucking dance with the Smurfs.

20:46.665 --> 20:49.265
And, so I just sat there.

20:49.298 --> 20:52.118
With my dad, being bummed...

20:52.131 --> 20:56.063
Watching a whole bunch of kids
who weren't me be... be happy.

20:56.064 --> 20:58.162
And enjoy their fucking lives.

20:58.163 --> 20:59.803
That's horrible!

20:59.896 --> 21:00.896
It was!

21:01.296 --> 21:02.828
It was... It was horrible.

21:02.829 --> 21:03.829
But...

21:06.429 --> 21:07.429
Yeah.

21:10.561 --> 21:13.626
I don't know, that's...
Why I do shit like this.

21:13.627 --> 21:16.292
Impromptu road trips to Oklahoma.

21:16.293 --> 21:19.325
I don't ever want to not
dance with the Smurfs again.

21:19.326 --> 21:20.926
I'm sorry, Cal.

21:21.426 --> 21:23.026
I'm sorry, too.

21:23.226 --> 21:25.791
If it makes you feel any better...

21:25.792 --> 21:28.624
My parents never took
me to an amusement park.

21:28.625 --> 21:31.215
They mostlyjust did drugs.

21:34.123 --> 21:37.655
That doesn't make me
feel better at all, Ada.

21:37.656 --> 21:40.621
At all... Like not even remotely.

21:40.622 --> 21:43.721
I mean, I'm trying to
remember all of these things...

21:43.722 --> 21:46.822
And the one thing I do know...

21:47.222 --> 21:50.620
I remember that both my
parents did like a lot of drugs.

21:50.621 --> 21:52.719
I think my dad was a drug dealer.

21:52.720 --> 21:53.919
Pretty sure.

21:53.920 --> 21:56.052
We had one of those wicker chairs...

21:56.053 --> 21:57.419
You know, those round wicker chairs.

21:57.420 --> 21:59.110
Pa pasa n, yeah.

21:59.986 --> 22:02.750
Like, the only people
that have those chairs...

22:02.751 --> 22:04.884
Are into a lot of drugs.

22:04.885 --> 22:06.916
They're into a lot of drugs!

22:06.917 --> 22:10.197
My aunt had one of those chairs.

22:12.116 --> 22:15.299
I guess... I guess I learned
something about my aunt today.

22:15.334 --> 22:19.595
No, like the worst furniture
we had was this glass

22:19.596 --> 22:25.070
that was on top of these things
that hold coffins up at funerals.

22:27.445 --> 22:30.745
Ok, so what kind of
Munsters shit is that?

22:30.746 --> 22:31.746
I know!

22:32.880 --> 22:33.880
Jesus.

22:37.545 --> 22:40.095
Well, that's good, right?

22:40.811 --> 22:43.821
It's good that you're like...

22:44.611 --> 22:46.471
Remembering things.

22:47.277 --> 22:52.780
Yeah, I remember things about Sheol.
I don't remember things about me.

22:54.109 --> 22:55.891
Like, my mom was a crime
scene cleaning lady.

22:55.926 --> 22:58.889
- In a town with 73 people?
- Yeah!

22:58.924 --> 23:01.210
- That's something that they need?
- Yeah, um...

23:01.245 --> 23:04.510
No firefighters. But more than one
person cleaning up crime scenes.

23:04.545 --> 23:05.617
Okay.

23:05.652 --> 23:08.756
This one day, we woke up and...

23:08.791 --> 23:11.890
This one guy poisoned
all of the dogs in town

23:11.891 --> 23:15.663
and then lined up the dead
dogs all along the main road.

23:15.698 --> 23:19.604
- Just dead dogs lined up.
- Holy shit.

23:19.605 --> 23:22.964
Yeah! My mom cleaned this
one murdered dude's house...

23:22.999 --> 23:26.691
And, she found this drain

23:26.726 --> 23:31.701
in the bottom of his floor for like
collecting all the blood, and...

23:31.736 --> 23:33.883
Sacrifice juices.

23:34.302 --> 23:35.712
From whatever.

23:36.701 --> 23:40.600
I guess he didn't want to
get it moldy or whatever.

23:40.601 --> 23:44.532
And, so we - right now
- we are driving there?

23:44.533 --> 23:48.098
Yeah, he had like deer
legs glued to the wall...

23:48.099 --> 23:51.264
Like some kind of House of a
Thousand Deer Legs bullshit.

23:51.265 --> 23:53.398
And we are driving...

23:53.399 --> 23:54.399
There?

23:55.265 --> 23:58.597
Hey! You wanted to make it a thing!

23:58.598 --> 23:59.598
My fault.

24:04.963 --> 24:07.373
Are you paying together?

24:21.927 --> 24:24.059
I'm not sure. I may have to go check.

24:24.060 --> 24:26.200
If you're interested.

24:34.591 --> 24:36.723
Did you find everything
you were looking for?

24:36.724 --> 24:38.044
Yeah, thanks.

24:40.456 --> 24:42.186
Where you headed?

24:43.523 --> 24:45.023
Uh... Oklahoma.

24:45.455 --> 24:46.505
Road trip.

24:47.289 --> 24:48.699
Hmmm... sucks.

24:50.955 --> 24:52.775
You look familiar.

24:53.087 --> 24:54.917
Do you go to RHS?

24:55.554 --> 24:56.554
No...

24:57.687 --> 24:59.647
I'm from Cleveland.

24:59.786 --> 25:01.886
And, I'm like... 30.

25:03.352 --> 25:04.492
Oh... okay.

25:06.286 --> 25:07.286
Okay.

25:09.351 --> 25:11.417
Jay says "hi" by the way.

25:11.418 --> 25:12.518
He's good.

25:13.350 --> 25:14.350
Yeah.

25:15.551 --> 25:16.781
<i>Mmmm hmmmnm.</i>

25:18.917 --> 25:21.287
Tell Eddie I said "hi."

25:25.116 --> 25:27.614
No, nothing, we're just
on our way back home.

25:27.615 --> 25:28.845
<i>Mmmm hmmmnm.</i>

25:31.181 --> 25:33.280
Hey, Cal's back so I got to go.

25:33.281 --> 25:34.281
Okay.

25:35.547 --> 25:36.547
Okay.

25:39.612 --> 25:40.612
Love you.

25:42.013 --> 25:43.013
Love you!

25:44.112 --> 25:46.844
Say “I love you“ one more time.

25:46.845 --> 25:50.210
It's fine. We'll meet up some time.

25:50.211 --> 25:51.441
Okay, Mom...

25:52.343 --> 25:53.533
I love you.

25:54.277 --> 25:55.277
Bye.

25:56.410 --> 25:57.410
Bye!

26:05.108 --> 26:08.007
Mom confirms, the Sacrifice Guy
had a sacrificing slab in his house.

26:08.008 --> 26:10.018
I don't believe it.

26:11.541 --> 26:14.273
Did you tell her we were going to Sheol?

26:14.274 --> 26:16.772
Hell no, I told her we
were going to visit Jay!

26:16.773 --> 26:17.773
Whatever.

26:19.439 --> 26:20.439
A slab!

26:21.572 --> 26:22.572
Cal.

26:30.870 --> 26:34.035
So, now that we're getting close...

26:34.036 --> 26:36.169
Where do you want to start?

26:36.170 --> 26:38.680
What do you want to see?

26:38.769 --> 26:41.368
I mean the town is really small.

26:41.369 --> 26:45.100
It's seriously like a
post office and a church.

26:45.101 --> 26:48.933
We could go by my old
house. It looks like a barn.

26:48.934 --> 26:53.724
Is it a barn, Ada? Did
you grow up in a barn?

26:56.199 --> 26:57.699
Thanks, Calvin.

26:58.366 --> 26:59.366
For what?

27:00.732 --> 27:02.282
For doing this.

27:02.864 --> 27:03.864
For...

27:04.697 --> 27:06.830
Going with me. For driving. For...

27:06.831 --> 27:08.381
Being so sweet.

27:08.430 --> 27:10.562
That's something I have to do.

27:10.563 --> 27:12.803
I've got to be sweet.

27:14.329 --> 27:16.519
No, you really don't.

27:43.924 --> 27:44.924
Sit down.

27:58.155 --> 27:59.345
I love you.

28:02.320 --> 28:03.420
I'm sorry.

28:04.420 --> 28:05.420
No, no...

28:05.753 --> 28:06.753
Kiss me.

28:06.853 --> 28:07.886
I'm sorry.

28:07.887 --> 28:09.167
You're okay.

28:10.519 --> 28:11.519
You're...

28:21.650 --> 28:22.750
It's okay.

29:18.540 --> 29:19.680
Hi... uh...

29:20.707 --> 29:24.838
You wouldn't happen to know
what's in this, would you?

29:24.839 --> 29:29.037
I cam in looking for Teddy
Grahams, but I didn't see any.

29:29.038 --> 29:31.570
My girlfriend doesn't eat animal
products so I have to check everything.

29:31.571 --> 29:33.736
What's that on your hat, boy?

29:33.737 --> 29:34.927
My hat? Oh!

29:35.303 --> 29:36.303
Cleveland.

29:37.704 --> 29:40.535
Yeah, I know, they're fucking terrible.

29:40.536 --> 29:42.702
But, I lived there
for like 14 years so...

29:42.703 --> 29:44.801
I don't know. Some stuff
kind ofjust stays with you.

29:44.802 --> 29:46.467
So, you're from Cleveland?

29:46.468 --> 29:47.878
Um... Bedford.

29:49.068 --> 29:51.200
But, the Tribe is from Cleveland proper.

29:51.201 --> 29:52.466
So, yeah, in that area...

29:52.467 --> 29:53.467
Tribe?

29:56.733 --> 29:59.603
What, are you a damn Yankee?

30:00.299 --> 30:02.989
Um... No, that's New York.

30:03.565 --> 30:08.130
You know, what... I
don't like your language.

30:08.165 --> 30:12.278
You from goddamned Ohio,
and you come into my store?

30:12.313 --> 30:15.634
Listen, I did not intend on
offending anybody whatsoever.

30:15.669 --> 30:18.956
I just came into pee, and
grab something to eat, so...

30:19.930 --> 30:22.958
I tell you what, boy... You
stand there one more minute,

30:22.959 --> 30:26.092
and you're gonna see what I
think about what you mean to do!

30:26.127 --> 30:28.518
Fuck out of our town!

30:36.060 --> 30:39.200
They didn't have Teddy Grahams?

30:40.292 --> 30:44.224
Um, no... They didn't have anything.

30:44.225 --> 30:46.445
Acquiring satellites...

30:47.024 --> 30:49.156
I can tell you how to get to my house.

30:49.157 --> 30:50.257
It's easy.

30:51.290 --> 30:53.388
Is your phone getting any signal?

30:53.389 --> 30:55.899
Can you like look it up?

30:56.722 --> 31:00.092
The whole town is like S streets.

31:00.988 --> 31:03.553
Well, I can't... How can you even
see where you're going out here?

31:03.554 --> 31:05.954
There's no street lights.
Is that not a thing?

31:05.955 --> 31:08.220
Are you sure you're okay?

31:08.221 --> 31:09.231
I'm fine.

31:11.787 --> 31:14.018
I said I was fine. I meant I was fine.

31:14.019 --> 31:17.852
Let's just get to
where we're going, okay?

31:17.853 --> 31:18.853
Okay.

31:20.451 --> 31:24.731
Go up the road and
take your first right.

31:25.051 --> 31:27.861
Acquiring fucking satellites.

31:41.014 --> 31:43.646
Ada, I don't think this is it.

31:43.647 --> 31:45.787
There's nothing here.

31:47.013 --> 31:52.011
No, this is it. That's the dilapidated
house. So my house should be...

31:52.012 --> 31:54.382
There. There's my tree!

31:55.946 --> 31:58.044
There's not a house here.

31:58.045 --> 31:59.645
No, this is it.

32:01.211 --> 32:03.401
That's the
tree my-

32:04.977 --> 32:07.942
My aunt told me that they
used to hang people from it.

32:07.943 --> 32:11.593
We used to play on it all the time.

32:13.542 --> 32:19.542
You should probably stop calling
it "your" tree at that point.

32:23.207 --> 32:25.839
Jay fell out of it one night.

32:25.840 --> 32:28.672
And I didn't know what to do.

32:28.673 --> 32:30.804
So, I just poured Sprite in his mouth.

32:30.805 --> 32:32.105
He bit his tongue.

32:32.106 --> 32:34.704
Bleeding all over the place.

32:34.705 --> 32:36.255
It just burned.

32:42.837 --> 32:46.347
Ada, but there's not a house here.

32:51.802 --> 32:53.352
Did you have...

32:53.935 --> 32:56.395
Did you have a basement?

32:58.534 --> 33:00.724
We had a crawl space.

33:16.630 --> 33:18.640
This is a bad idea.

33:19.764 --> 33:21.862
Why is it a bad idea?

33:21.863 --> 33:23.628
We're showing up in
the middle of the night.

33:23.629 --> 33:25.662
I don't even know if
she will recognize me.

33:25.663 --> 33:27.861
And I'm knocking on a stranger's door.

33:27.862 --> 33:31.782
She's not a stranger. She's your aunt.

33:52.191 --> 33:54.356
Davis Langston, this is the
last time you're gonna do this-

33:54.357 --> 33:55.677
Aunt Lindsay!

33:56.490 --> 33:58.255
It's me, Ada. I'm sorry!

33:58.256 --> 33:59.989
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, Ada!

34:02.422 --> 34:04.521
Oh, baby... I haven't seen you in ages!

34:04.522 --> 34:06.321
What are you doing here?

34:06.322 --> 34:07.462
We
were-

34:08.321 --> 34:10.420
We were here so we just thought...

34:10.420 --> 34:11.841
We'd stop by.

34:13.420 --> 34:15.880
Your friend, is he okay?

34:16.353 --> 34:18.784
Yes ma'am. Just startled me is all.

34:18.786 --> 34:21.116
It's been a bad night.

34:21.753 --> 34:23.393
That's terrible.

34:23.851 --> 34:24.851
Oh, that's terrible.

34:24.887 --> 34:27.917
Come in. You come in. Come in now.

34:27.918 --> 34:29.184
Come in. Come in.

34:29.185 --> 34:30.750
Just, let's go.

34:30.751 --> 34:31.940
Come on in.

34:32.117 --> 34:33.117
Come.

34:33.184 --> 34:34.554
Oh, my god...

34:37.283 --> 34:38.922
Are you alright?

35:02.845 --> 35:04.715
Just wrap it up...

35:07.111 --> 35:10.071
Make it all clean and nice...

35:10.844 --> 35:12.975
Just get it inside...

35:12.976 --> 35:14.442
Okay. Right there.

35:14.443 --> 35:16.633
That's gonna be good.

35:19.842 --> 35:20.842
There.

35:22.075 --> 35:24.140
Sorry about the door...

35:24.141 --> 35:25.606
And the lights...

35:25.607 --> 35:27.606
Gave you such a fright.

35:27.607 --> 35:29.739
I'm Ada's aunt, Lindsay.

35:29.740 --> 35:31.110
And, you are?

35:31.506 --> 35:32.826
My boyfriend.

35:33.440 --> 35:35.638
What's going on with Davis?

35:35.639 --> 35:36.639
Out.

35:37.739 --> 35:38.739
Again.

35:38.806 --> 35:39.856
All hours.

35:42.105 --> 35:45.969
I was just waiting for him
there when you knocked, so...

35:45.970 --> 35:48.930
Sorry to scare you like that.

35:49.403 --> 35:52.102
Oh... You didn't give me a scare.

35:52.103 --> 35:54.501
Nothing gives me a scare anymore.

35:54.502 --> 35:56.192
I live in Sheol.

35:59.468 --> 36:01.467
That's
actually what-

36:01.468 --> 36:04.000
Aunt Lindsay...
Would you mind if we stayed?

36:04.001 --> 36:05.001
Oh...

36:05.400 --> 36:07.000
No, not at all.

36:07.500 --> 36:10.632
How long you thinking on staying?

36:10.633 --> 36:13.331
We're just passing through.

36:13.332 --> 36:16.562
Calving, could you get the bags?

36:21.998 --> 36:23.048
Thank you.

37:29.919 --> 37:32.889
I think I need to go to bed.

37:34.985 --> 37:38.749
Well, I'll put you two in Daddy's room.

37:38.750 --> 37:41.083
I think I'm gonna stay
out here for a while.

37:41.084 --> 37:42.454
Come with me.

37:43.216 --> 37:44.216
You sure?

37:45.283 --> 37:46.283
Alright.

37:47.382 --> 37:48.415
Be careful.

37:48.416 --> 37:50.056
Careful of what?

38:09.445 --> 38:11.225
Don't mind Daddy.

38:18.310 --> 38:20.475
Oh, you should be awfully
comfortable here... uh...

38:20.476 --> 38:21.476
Calvin.

38:23.376 --> 38:24.926
Is that French?

38:25.642 --> 38:27.242
I have no idea.

38:27.775 --> 38:28.775
Well...

38:30.208 --> 38:32.407
I don't know what you two do when...

38:32.408 --> 38:34.278
You're in Texas...

38:36.907 --> 38:40.738
But, while you're here
in Daddy's house...

38:40.739 --> 38:42.872
I expect that you're
gonna respect Daddy's bed.

38:42.873 --> 38:43.873
So...

38:44.439 --> 38:46.737
Of course.
Yeah.

38:46.738 --> 38:51.008
You should be very
comfortable right here.

38:54.804 --> 38:57.354
Nice to have you, Calvin.

39:05.035 --> 39:07.567
Does anyone have WiFi around here?

39:07.568 --> 39:09.700
Does your mother know you're here?

39:09.701 --> 39:10.701
No.

39:11.867 --> 39:13.557
How's she doing?

39:15.366 --> 39:17.532
Never sends me a Christmas card...

39:17.533 --> 39:19.313
Or talks to me...

39:19.366 --> 39:22.776
Get nothing for Easter from her...

39:24.765 --> 39:27.495
What happened to our house?

39:28.531 --> 39:30.441
Nothing, I suppose.

39:31.563 --> 39:34.596
We went there earlier to day
and it's not there anymore.

39:34.597 --> 39:37.294
I haven't been over
to that house in years.

39:37.295 --> 39:40.935
Aunt Lindsay, it's two streets over.

39:42.628 --> 39:46.808
Where is your mother
settling these days?

39:47.794 --> 39:49.926
Hauls you and Jay off into Texas...

39:49.927 --> 39:51.657
Leaves me here...

39:52.227 --> 39:54.291
Well, that's like Del.

39:54.292 --> 39:57.291
Never cares about nobody but Del.

39:57.292 --> 39:59.457
You know, I thought maybe it had
been tom down or burned down...

39:59.458 --> 40:00.624
But, the tree is still there.

40:00.625 --> 40:02.585
I mostly stay here.

40:02.625 --> 40:03.675
By myself.

40:04.424 --> 40:06.857
With Davis.
When he's home.

40:06.858 --> 40:07.998
Not injail.

40:08.190 --> 40:09.190
Daddy...

40:10.024 --> 40:11.574
Daddy's things.

40:16.023 --> 40:17.393
What is that?

40:19.422 --> 40:20.612
Oh, my Fox?

40:22.187 --> 40:23.187
Ada...

40:25.421 --> 40:29.452
I just got it. It
makes me feel stronger.

40:29.453 --> 40:31.585
When did you stop believing in God?

40:31.586 --> 40:32.586
L\ \ \

40:35.785 --> 40:37.565
You're so stupid.

40:39.952 --> 40:44.772
Putting cuttings in your
flesh is for the dead.

40:45.018 --> 40:47.749
God said you're not supposed
to put cuttings in your flesh.

40:47.750 --> 40:49.940
It says in The Bible!

40:51.383 --> 40:55.115
Aunt Lindsay, I never said
I didn't believe in God.

40:55.116 --> 40:57.247
If you were my daughter
I would throw you out!

40:57.248 --> 40:59.848
Aunt Lindsay, it's a Fox.

43:03.359 --> 43:04.959
No, don't go...

43:08.391 --> 43:12.491
If you leave me, you'll never come back.

43:13.757 --> 43:15.537
What should I do?

43:16.357 --> 43:18.555
She'll never get better.

43:18.556 --> 43:19.556
I know.

43:21.723 --> 43:23.503
What should I do?

43:25.255 --> 43:27.035
Send her to Hell.

43:27.421 --> 43:29.381
Or leave her there.

43:29.388 --> 43:31.258
When she finds it.

44:45.341 --> 44:47.071
Oh, good morning.

44:48.007 --> 44:50.472
It's so nice to have you here.

44:50.473 --> 44:52.163
How'd you sleep?

44:53.672 --> 44:55.805
Davis is still asleep.

44:55.806 --> 44:57.837
We have to keep it quiet.

44:57.838 --> 44:59.870
Would you like some breakfast?

44:59.871 --> 45:01.037
I can make you some breakfast.

45:01.038 --> 45:02.737
I can make you some, um...

45:02.738 --> 45:04.536
I got some oatmeal...

45:04.537 --> 45:06.669
We're probably just gonna...

45:06.670 --> 45:07.670
Get out.

45:07.737 --> 45:09.502
Take in the sights.

45:09.503 --> 45:11.603
We'll be back later.

45:13.369 --> 45:16.239
It wouldn't take a minute...

45:27.133 --> 45:29.231
Hey, why don't we just walk?

45:29.232 --> 45:30.602
Are you sure?

45:31.299 --> 45:34.831
The whole town is like five streets.

45:34.832 --> 45:35.832
Whatever.

46:03.727 --> 46:06.525
She wasn't always like that.

46:06.526 --> 46:07.576
Like what?

46:08.659 --> 46:10.299
Well, like that.

46:10.492 --> 46:11.991
She was always on drugs...

46:11.992 --> 46:15.123
But she wasn't always... like that.

46:15.124 --> 46:16.674
Like, a weirdo?

46:17.224 --> 46:18.323
Yeah, like a weirdo.

46:18.324 --> 46:21.056
I think, I'm pretty sure...

46:21.057 --> 46:23.189
If you're always on
drugs and raising a kid...

46:23.190 --> 46:26.155
That makes you always a weirdo.

46:26.156 --> 46:28.288
I'm pretty sure everyone in this
town is on drugs and raising kids.

46:28.289 --> 46:29.487
You would have to be!

46:29.488 --> 46:31.987
I mean, there's nothing here.

46:31.988 --> 46:32.988
Yeah...

46:35.487 --> 46:39.257
Everything feels like a weird dream...

46:39.653 --> 46:43.319
But, not real, you know? I feel
like I've seen it in a dream...

46:43.320 --> 46:45.451
But, you know how sometimes
you have those dreams...

46:45.452 --> 46:46.518
Where, like, I'm talking to Calvin...

46:46.519 --> 46:49.484
But, really, you're a blue dog?

46:49.485 --> 46:51.617
Wait, I'm a blue dog in your dreams?

46:51.618 --> 46:53.650
Well, like, I don't know. It
was an example, but probably.

46:53.651 --> 46:55.550
Is this a sexy thing?

46:55.551 --> 46:56.551
No. No...

46:59.183 --> 47:01.648
Wait, why am I a blue
dog in your dreams?

47:01.649 --> 47:04.381
I don't know. It just
happens. It's how dreams work.

47:04.382 --> 47:06.515
Is it some weird Picasso thing?

47:06.516 --> 47:08.214
Being with me is a Blue Period for you?

47:08.215 --> 47:09.215
Probably.

47:09.381 --> 47:10.947
It's probably the Blue Period.

47:10.948 --> 47:12.847
Okay, great.
Cool.

47:12.948 --> 47:15.479
I'm probably gonna become
a genius anytime now.

47:15.480 --> 47:18.179
I hope so, and it's my fault.

47:18.180 --> 47:22.310
Probably his most
prolific period anyway.

48:13.304 --> 48:17.834
The only thing I remember about
this place is the ghost stories.

48:17.835 --> 48:21.634
There used to be train
tracks over there...

48:21.635 --> 48:24.667
Supposedly, some guy got off...

48:24.668 --> 48:26.218
With a lantern.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.133
And now you can just
see it floating around...

48:30.134 --> 48:31.134
At night.

48:32.600 --> 48:34.240
That's colorful.

48:35.500 --> 48:37.631
Yeah, I think the trick is...

48:37.632 --> 48:39.464
No one comes here at night.

48:39.465 --> 48:40.925
So, who knows?

48:42.464 --> 48:43.464
Well...

48:44.831 --> 48:46.971
Your house is gone...

48:47.997 --> 48:51.227
Maybe you're supposed to wander?

48:51.530 --> 48:54.260
That would explain my life.

49:22.158 --> 49:23.158
<i>HEY".</i>

49:24.758 --> 49:27.448
You wanna go check it out?

49:27.456 --> 49:28.916
It's Saturday.

49:29.623 --> 49:31.853
I promised you church.

49:32.622 --> 49:34.821
We had Saturday service all the time.

49:34.822 --> 49:36.954
And, it's Oklahoma... I
guarantee you they're open.

49:36.955 --> 49:37.955
Calvin...

49:57.018 --> 49:58.888
Guess I was wrong.

50:00.151 --> 50:02.483
I feel really weird right now.

50:02.484 --> 50:04.354
Why, what's wrong?

50:04.617 --> 50:05.667
Excuse me.

50:06.150 --> 50:07.980
Can I help y'all?

50:08.283 --> 50:09.283
Um...

50:10.316 --> 50:11.456
Yeah, uh...

50:13.116 --> 50:15.247
We were just trying to
figure some stuff out.

50:15.248 --> 50:16.298
And, uh...

50:16.681 --> 50:18.461
We ended up here.

50:18.814 --> 50:19.814
So...

50:26.513 --> 50:27.833
And church...

50:29.412 --> 50:33.142
Is where you figure stuff out, right?

50:33.778 --> 50:34.778
Hello.

50:35.912 --> 50:37.310
I'm Preacher Woodward.

50:37.311 --> 50:39.442
How y'all doing today? You okay?

50:39.443 --> 50:41.576
You look a little pink, dear.

50:41.577 --> 50:42.808
Y'all come on inside.

50:42.809 --> 50:44.175
Sorry, if we're interrupting...

50:44.176 --> 50:46.980
No, no no.
It's why I'm here.

50:48.075 --> 50:49.905
Y'all come on in.

50:50.175 --> 50:52.074
Nice and warm in here.

50:52.075 --> 50:53.075
Welcome.

51:09.572 --> 51:12.222
So, how can I help y'all?

51:13.005 --> 51:14.875
What's the matter?

51:16.471 --> 51:18.569
Oh, that's just Marlow, my daughter.

51:18.570 --> 51:19.570
Sorry.

51:20.737 --> 51:22.835
She helps me with some of the busy work.

51:22.836 --> 51:24.902
We serve as the town's church...

51:24.903 --> 51:26.223
And mortuary.

51:26.836 --> 51:28.967
Telling people where to go...

51:28.968 --> 51:30.600
And showing them how to get there.

51:30.601 --> 51:33.721
Marlow, hunny...
Say "hello." Be polite.

51:35.268 --> 51:36.368
It's okay.

51:37.400 --> 51:38.499
Come on in.

51:38.500 --> 51:39.870
I, um, God...

51:39.933 --> 51:41.932
Do you have a bathroom I can use?

51:41.933 --> 51:43.665
Is there a bathroom?

51:43.666 --> 51:45.797
We have a bathroom in
the fellowship hall...

51:45.798 --> 51:48.797
There's a door in
there, but it's locked.

51:48.798 --> 51:50.930
There's another toilet downstairs,
right through them doors-

51:50.931 --> 51:52.801
Okay, that's fine.

51:53.597 --> 51:55.377
Have a seat, bud.

51:59.930 --> 52:01.390
So, tell me...

52:02.762 --> 52:06.582
You said you were looking for answers.

52:06.794 --> 52:07.934
Yeah, um...

52:09.661 --> 52:12.126
I'm actually not sure how
much you'll be able to help us.

52:12.127 --> 52:15.492
My girlfriend, Ada, grew up here...

52:15.493 --> 52:18.408
We're trying to find
out if anything weird

52:18.409 --> 52:21.153
or bad happened to
her when she was a kid.

52:21.188 --> 52:24.291
So, we drove up from Austin...
I don't know, to...

52:24.292 --> 52:25.724
Visit, or whatever.

52:25.725 --> 52:28.257
And... I don't really know.

52:28.258 --> 52:29.808
She lived here.

52:30.458 --> 52:31.458
She left.

52:34.056 --> 52:35.926
And she came back?

52:36.990 --> 52:38.630
Yeah, is that...

52:39.122 --> 52:40.455
Is that weird?

52:40.456 --> 52:41.456
Marlow...

52:41.488 --> 52:42.488
Hunny...

52:45.121 --> 52:48.441
Please... Give us a moment, okay?

52:49.287 --> 52:50.887
<i>I'm sorwngo on.</i>

52:51.820 --> 52:52.820
Uh...

52:54.053 --> 52:56.585
Things have actually been
pretty weird since we got here.

52:56.586 --> 53:00.317
The house that she grew up in is gone.

53:00.318 --> 53:02.451
And, I got threatened at a gas station.

53:02.452 --> 53:03.592
And, and...

53:07.150 --> 53:10.820
Found this outside of the post office.

53:10.821 --> 53:13.393
Some kind of ancient coin.

53:13.428 --> 53:16.994
That's not a normal thing to find
outside of a post office, right?

53:45.377 --> 53:46.517
You know...

53:49.043 --> 53:51.503
People come here to die.

53:52.209 --> 53:54.039
I don't know why.

53:55.642 --> 53:57.741
Whether they've been
here before or not...

53:57.742 --> 54:00.773
They show up on my door step...

54:00.774 --> 54:01.914
Or, they...

54:04.207 --> 54:06.437
Wander into the woods.

54:07.473 --> 54:08.473
And...

54:11.240 --> 54:12.750
It's my job...

54:13.305 --> 54:15.355
To see them through.

54:15.905 --> 54:16.905
So...

54:22.737 --> 54:25.247
How are you gonna do it?

54:27.036 --> 54:28.036
Um...

54:29.136 --> 54:31.135
I'm sorry...
Do what?

54:34.935 --> 54:36.345
Kill yourself.

54:40.400 --> 54:41.770
It's alright.

54:43.033 --> 54:44.133
It's okay.

54:45.133 --> 54:47.065
It's nothing to be afraid of.

54:47.066 --> 54:51.698
Something much bigger than
you brought you here, boy.

54:51.699 --> 54:52.699
Here.

54:57.131 --> 55:00.911
How about you go ahead and keep that?

55:10.696 --> 55:12.976
Calvin, we need to go.

55:17.428 --> 55:20.559
This place is so fucking crazy.

55:20.560 --> 55:23.758
He just asked me how I
was gonna kill myself.

55:23.759 --> 55:24.759
Hey!

55:26.059 --> 55:28.191
Are y'all coming to service later?

55:28.192 --> 55:29.512
Probably not.

55:29.959 --> 55:32.099
Great! See you there!

55:33.525 --> 55:35.690
This is the part where we say
"fuck the plans“ and bail, right?

55:35.691 --> 55:36.691
Yes...

55:38.057 --> 55:40.189
I'm sorry. I am very sorry.

55:40.190 --> 55:44.087
I don't know why we came here. Let's
just go by, say "goodbye" to your Aunt

55:44.088 --> 55:48.087
and go back to Austin and forget any of
this ever fucking happened to us, okay?

55:48.088 --> 55:50.438
- That's fine.
- That's awesome.

55:52.788 --> 55:54.248
What the fuck?

56:19.683 --> 56:20.783
I'm sorry.

56:21.216 --> 56:23.014
Aunt Lindsay, what the fuck?!

56:23.015 --> 56:27.300
- You shouldn't talk to me like that!
- Who cares how I fucking talk to you.

56:27.335 --> 56:30.219
You just tried to stab my
boyfriend... and my car?

56:30.254 --> 56:32.580
I thought he was you Uncle Davis.

56:32.581 --> 56:34.712
Why is the car on fire?!

56:34.713 --> 56:36.712
What did Davis do to you?

56:36.713 --> 56:37.713
Nothing.

56:39.112 --> 56:41.245
He just... He was just...

56:41.246 --> 56:43.206
A little bit upset.

56:44.345 --> 56:46.444
Doesn't like Calvin staying
here. He saw Calvin...

56:46.445 --> 56:48.045
Is he here now?

56:48.511 --> 56:51.111
No, I don't know... He...

56:51.844 --> 56:53.764
He left. He's out.

56:55.777 --> 56:57.908
So, what... He just
beats the shit out of you?

56:57.909 --> 56:59.708
Is that how this works?

56:59.709 --> 57:01.399
It was my fault.

57:03.242 --> 57:05.707
She brought evil into our house.

57:05.708 --> 57:11.708
This is bullshit. I'm calling
someone and getting out of here.

57:25.271 --> 57:26.271
Mom?

57:27.904 --> 57:29.044
Mom, hello?

57:31.670 --> 57:33.769
It's me. I'm in Sheol.

57:33.770 --> 57:35.402
I'm at Aunt Lindsay's, and...

57:35.403 --> 57:36.403
Hello?

57:38.235 --> 57:40.425
Mom, can you hear me?

57:47.167 --> 57:51.127
Aunt Lindsay, I need to use your phone.

57:53.666 --> 57:55.765
I don't have a phone.

57:55.766 --> 57:59.619
What?
Why don't you have a phone?!

57:59.665 --> 58:02.730
Everybody that I need to talk to...

58:02.731 --> 58:04.863
Everyone that I'm supposed to talk to...

58:04.864 --> 58:06.504
Is already here.

58:09.397 --> 58:11.528
Ada, we have got to go.

58:11.529 --> 58:12.529
The car?

58:13.262 --> 58:16.222
Seriously, we have to go now!

58:22.494 --> 58:24.584
Davis... and Daddy...

58:49.589 --> 58:52.009
I'm gonna find you two.

58:52.489 --> 58:56.909
You can run, but you
damn sure can't hide.

59:11.652 --> 59:14.851
I know y'all are around here somewhere.

59:14.852 --> 59:16.132
I heard you.

59:19.818 --> 59:20.818
Ada?

59:24.150 --> 59:29.210
You know it's not safe
to be out in these woods.

59:30.582 --> 59:34.380
I know I told your mama to tell you
about that when you were a little girl.

59:34.381 --> 59:36.513
You know this is not the place to be.

59:36.514 --> 59:38.434
Y'all come on out.

59:40.147 --> 59:41.427
Come on now.

59:42.380 --> 59:44.250
I just wanna talk!

01:00:13.641 --> 01:00:15.871
What about your phone?

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:21.806
My phone's been dead since last
night. I didn't even think about it.

01:00:21.807 --> 01:00:22.857
Ada, wait!

01:00:24.806 --> 01:00:27.004
They probably have a phone!

01:00:27.005 --> 01:00:29.171
They don't have a phone.

01:00:29.172 --> 01:00:31.303
No on here has a phone.

01:00:31.304 --> 01:00:32.304
Alright?

01:00:33.837 --> 01:00:35.969
We are in fucking Hell.

01:00:35.970 --> 01:00:36.970
Okay?

01:00:38.069 --> 01:00:40.202
They have to place orders and things.

01:00:40.203 --> 01:00:44.483
If anyone has a phone,
they have a phone.

01:00:44.536 --> 01:00:46.667
They pulled a gun on me last
time I was in there for no reason.

01:00:46.668 --> 01:00:48.967
- Just for showing up.
- What, seriously?!

01:00:48.968 --> 01:00:49.968
Yes, I...

01:00:52.534 --> 01:00:55.899
I didn't want to tell you last night
because you were already upset...

01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:57.950
About the sex thing.

01:00:58.033 --> 01:00:59.033
So...

01:00:59.399 --> 01:01:02.589
Why wouldn't you tell me that?!

01:01:05.231 --> 01:01:07.631
Look, I'm just going to...

01:01:07.632 --> 01:01:09.730
Go buy us some waters,
make a phone call...

01:01:09.731 --> 01:01:13.691
And come right back. You can stay here.

01:01:13.897 --> 01:01:14.897
Here.

01:01:16.030 --> 01:01:17.030
Calvin..

01:01:18.862 --> 01:01:21.028
The only way I'm letting
you go in that gas station...

01:01:21.029 --> 01:01:24.039
Is if you take this with you.

01:02:16.485 --> 01:02:17.715
Excuse me...

01:02:18.619 --> 01:02:20.317
Can I help you with something?

01:02:20.318 --> 01:02:22.217
Oh, I was just going
to get a water-

01:02:22.218 --> 01:02:24.016
I know what you're doing!

01:02:24.017 --> 01:02:26.016
I know what you're doing in here!

01:02:26.017 --> 01:02:30.387
You want to bring this
evil into my store!

01:02:34.116 --> 01:02:35.116
Ada!

01:02:36.215 --> 01:02:38.725
Get the fuck off of her!

01:02:39.149 --> 01:02:40.519
Are you okay?

01:02:41.281 --> 01:02:42.421
Fuck, shit!

01:02:59.944 --> 01:03:02.864
Get the fuck out of the way!

01:03:20.007 --> 01:03:21.377
Are you okay?

01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:26.172
This is so fucked. I
just stabbed somebody!

01:03:26.173 --> 01:03:27.493
Yeah, well...

01:03:27.773 --> 01:03:30.271
You're gonna have to
stab somebody else...

01:03:30.272 --> 01:03:35.362
If these assholes don't
stop fucking following us!

01:04:39.826 --> 01:04:40.826
Shit.

01:04:42.626 --> 01:04:43.626
Ada...

01:04:45.692 --> 01:04:49.612
Ada, we have to go back to the church.

01:04:50.024 --> 01:04:52.714
If I just close my eyes...

01:04:53.591 --> 01:04:59.155
And open them again, I will be
home and all of this will be gone.

01:04:59.156 --> 01:05:03.322
It's the only place in this town where
somebody hasn't tried to kill us, okay?

01:05:03.323 --> 01:05:04.783
Just far away.

01:05:07.489 --> 01:05:10.819
Or, maybe he did try to kill us?

01:05:10.821 --> 01:05:14.586
I don't know... But
I know those people...

01:05:14.587 --> 01:05:16.686
Will not kill us inside the church.

01:05:16.687 --> 01:05:17.687
Okay?

01:05:18.753 --> 01:05:20.353
It didn't work.

01:05:21.853 --> 01:05:23.984
If we stay out here,
we are going to die.

01:05:23.985 --> 01:05:26.017
If we stay in these
woods, we are going to die.

01:05:26.018 --> 01:05:27.618
It didn't work.

01:05:28.151 --> 01:05:29.751
It didn't work.

01:05:30.617 --> 01:05:32.077
It never does.

01:05:38.916 --> 01:05:42.966
Do you remember which way the church is?

01:05:45.148 --> 01:05:48.698
If the gas station is over there...

01:05:48.948 --> 01:05:51.858
Then, the church should be...

01:06:00.178 --> 01:06:01.178
Fuck.

01:06:03.445 --> 01:06:04.905
Meet me there.

01:06:06.344 --> 01:06:07.804
Meet me there.

01:06:10.844 --> 01:06:15.984
Where the Tree of Life is
blooming, meet me there.

01:06:16.509 --> 01:06:19.575
When the storms of life are over.

01:06:19.576 --> 01:06:22.216
On the happy golden shore.

01:06:23.008 --> 01:06:27.606
Where the faithful part
no more, meet me there.

01:06:27.607 --> 01:06:30.837
Here are fondest hopes are vain.

01:06:30.973 --> 01:06:34.293
Dearest links are rent and twain.

01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:40.610
But, in Heaven no throb
of pain, meet me there.

01:06:40.938 --> 01:06:43.938
By the river sparkling bright.

01:06:43.973 --> 01:06:46.308
In the city of delight.

01:06:49.503 --> 01:06:53.402
Where our faith is lost
in sight, meet me there.

01:06:53.403 --> 01:06:54.403
Hello?!

01:06:55.502 --> 01:06:56.502
Woodward!

01:06:57.968 --> 01:06:58.968
Woodward!

01:07:00.102 --> 01:07:01.102
Hello?

01:07:01.501 --> 01:07:02.501
Anyone?!

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:08.190
Fellowship hall?

01:07:46.426 --> 01:07:47.426
Woodward?

01:08:06.956 --> 01:08:09.088
Ada, I don't think this is the...

01:08:09.089 --> 01:08:13.459
I don't think this is
the fellowship hall!

01:08:44.649 --> 01:08:46.747
What's going on in here?

01:08:46.749 --> 01:08:47.939
Y'all okay?

01:08:57.447 --> 01:08:59.777
Y'all can't stay here.

01:09:01.779 --> 01:09:05.810
You're not gonna be any safer.
You're only putting me in danger.

01:09:05.812 --> 01:09:08.682
Where are we supposed to go?

01:09:09.877 --> 01:09:11.975
No one has a phone. We're a
hundred miles from anywhere.

01:09:11.977 --> 01:09:13.837
Preacher Woodard...

01:09:14.977 --> 01:09:19.809
Earlier, we saw your
daughter in the graveyard...

01:09:19.810 --> 01:09:21.090
Is she okay?

01:09:27.542 --> 01:09:30.872
Everybody here makes
sacrifices for their safety.

01:09:30.874 --> 01:09:33.654
What are we supposed to do?

01:09:33.774 --> 01:09:39.774
I'll tell you what you're
supposed to do, you're here to die!

01:09:39.971 --> 01:09:43.482
The only way to live is to escape.

01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:47.020
Or, to stay here... and leave.

01:09:47.371 --> 01:09:49.935
I don't know what you do here...

01:09:49.937 --> 01:09:52.103
But it has nothing to do with us.

01:09:52.104 --> 01:09:53.104
Please.

01:10:02.436 --> 01:10:05.086
I can show you a way out.

01:10:06.867 --> 01:10:10.100
But, it's a long walk
through them woods.

01:10:10.101 --> 01:10:11.241
But, you...

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:15.940
Can never come back here, ever!

01:10:16.366 --> 01:10:18.236
Not to this world.

01:10:19.566 --> 01:10:20.616
Thank you.

01:10:26.564 --> 01:10:28.524
Where are we going?

01:10:28.898 --> 01:10:31.929
Well, Calvin, see that creek up there?

01:10:31.930 --> 01:10:34.095
We're gonna come to this creek...

01:10:34.096 --> 01:10:36.056
You gotta be quiet.

01:10:36.396 --> 01:10:39.394
This is as far as I can take you.

01:10:39.395 --> 01:10:41.594
Once we get to this creek...

01:10:41.595 --> 01:10:42.965
Listen to me.

01:10:43.728 --> 01:10:45.228
Very important.

01:10:45.394 --> 01:10:47.527
You keep walking through them woods...

01:10:47.528 --> 01:10:49.359
About a mile or two.

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:51.459
You're gonna come to a road.

01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:53.780
And, whatever you do...

01:10:55.693 --> 01:10:57.791
Make sure you look for
somebody headed west.

01:10:57.792 --> 01:10:58.792
Not east.

01:11:00.558 --> 01:11:04.928
And hope they stop,
and that they're kind.

01:11:05.857 --> 01:11:08.547
How do you know this path?

01:11:10.123 --> 01:11:13.555
Well, Ada, we baptize folks
down here in the creek.

01:11:13.556 --> 01:11:16.696
Most times they come back with.

01:11:16.855 --> 01:11:18.265
Other times...

01:11:20.621 --> 01:11:22.753
The Lord just... takes them away.

01:11:22.754 --> 01:11:24.394
Takes them away?

01:11:24.454 --> 01:11:25.454
Yeah.

01:11:26.254 --> 01:11:28.534
In one way or another.

01:11:30.386 --> 01:11:32.584
I don't remember being baptized.

01:11:32.585 --> 01:11:33.585
Well...

01:11:34.686 --> 01:11:36.146
If you were...

01:11:37.718 --> 01:11:38.998
It was here.

01:11:40.518 --> 01:11:42.668
I don't think I was.

01:11:44.450 --> 01:11:46.582
I've had enough of this shit!

01:11:46.583 --> 01:11:47.583
Stop!

01:11:49.916 --> 01:11:52.782
Stay, Calvin!
No!

01:11:52.783 --> 01:11:54.383
Get off of her!

01:11:54.581 --> 01:11:56.747
In the name of The Father...

01:11:56.748 --> 01:11:59.080
The Son...
And the Holy Spirit...

01:11:59.974 --> 01:12:03.257
- Stop now!
- Get the fuck off of her!

01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:40.939
How far did he say the road is gonna be?

01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:42.773
Like a mile or two?

01:12:42.774 --> 01:12:43.774
But...

01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:47.950
Why should we believe anything he said?

01:12:48.205 --> 01:12:49.205
Shhhh!

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:58.844
Where the fuck have we been walking?

01:13:55.227 --> 01:13:56.227
Ada...

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:01.250
The town is that way.

01:14:01.326 --> 01:14:03.591
So, if we go this way...

01:14:03.592 --> 01:14:06.890
To our left, we will be out of here.

01:14:06.891 --> 01:14:09.761
Does that make sense to you?

01:14:10.924 --> 01:14:13.056
Ada, does that make sense?

01:14:13.057 --> 01:14:15.522
I don't know where the fuck I am!

01:14:15.523 --> 01:14:16.523
Ada!

01:14:18.423 --> 01:14:20.203
Fuck it, come on!

01:14:20.555 --> 01:14:21.555
Come on!

01:14:37.586 --> 01:14:40.084
Ada, I don't know what we're doing.

01:14:40.085 --> 01:14:41.685
I don't either.

01:14:46.318 --> 01:14:47.778
Are you tired?

01:14:50.050 --> 01:14:51.560
I am so tired.

01:14:56.915 --> 01:14:58.785
What if we just...

01:14:59.149 --> 01:15:01.699
Spend the night out here?

01:15:01.914 --> 01:15:02.914
Rest.

01:15:05.215 --> 01:15:06.905
Sleep if we can.

01:15:13.179 --> 01:15:16.511
Not in these fucking woods with
these fucking crazy people, Ada.

01:15:16.512 --> 01:15:19.202
We aren't... in the woods.

01:15:27.844 --> 01:15:29.975
You still got the knife, right?

01:15:29.976 --> 01:15:31.206
<i>Mmmm hmmmnm.</i>

01:15:36.643 --> 01:15:38.653
And, I've got this.

01:15:41.575 --> 01:15:42.575
Maybe...

01:15:43.674 --> 01:15:44.674
Wejust...

01:15:46.574 --> 01:15:49.814
Sit here for as long as we can.

01:15:51.072 --> 01:15:52.892
And if anything...

01:15:53.206 --> 01:15:54.704
Comes out of the woods...

01:15:54.705 --> 01:15:56.075
We'll just...

01:15:59.372 --> 01:16:04.292
We'll just do what we're
supposed to do, right?

01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:08.150
Cal, I'm really sorry.

01:16:11.069 --> 01:16:13.899
You don't have to be sorry.

01:16:14.669 --> 01:16:16.800
I am. I'm sorry about...

01:16:16.801 --> 01:16:17.891
Everything.

01:16:20.668 --> 01:16:21.858
I love you.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.510
And I want you. I really want you.

01:16:30.132 --> 01:16:32.231
It's just something just happens...

01:16:32.232 --> 01:16:33.692
It goes wrong.

01:16:36.998 --> 01:16:39.008
And I don't know...

01:16:39.064 --> 01:16:40.524
What to say...

01:16:41.163 --> 01:16:43.213
How to explain it...

01:16:43.297 --> 01:16:44.397
I'm sorry.

01:16:46.396 --> 01:16:48.086
I want you, too.

01:16:50.895 --> 01:16:52.035
Every d3)'-

01:16:53.028 --> 01:16:54.168
Every hour.

01:16:55.362 --> 01:16:59.560
Every second of every
day since I met you.

01:16:59.561 --> 01:17:01.692
I have never wanted anybody else.

01:17:01.693 --> 01:17:02.693
Even

01:17:03.127 --> 01:17:04.127
I know.

01:17:09.158 --> 01:17:10.258
I'm sorry.

01:17:11.791 --> 01:17:15.161
You have nothing to be sorry for.

01:17:15.324 --> 01:17:16.324
I do.

01:17:20.557 --> 01:17:24.707
I'm so terrified of you all of the time.

01:17:25.289 --> 01:17:28.388
Terrified that you'll get hurt.

01:17:28.389 --> 01:17:31.529
Terrified that you'll leave me.

01:17:34.721 --> 01:17:36.853
I'm terrified that one
day you'll wake up...

01:17:36.854 --> 01:17:39.486
And roll over and look at me...

01:17:39.487 --> 01:17:42.985
And just think "what
the fuck was I doing?!“

01:17:42.986 --> 01:17:45.766
And then you'll just leave.

01:17:48.218 --> 01:17:49.408
I wouldn't.

01:17:50.385 --> 01:17:52.783
I would never leave you.

01:17:52.784 --> 01:17:54.154
You saved me.

01:17:58.184 --> 01:18:00.549
I can't believe I did that.

01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:01.870
Notjust then.

01:18:04.782 --> 01:18:07.292
You never gave up on me.

01:18:07.815 --> 01:18:09.685
And, that's why...

01:18:11.981 --> 01:18:14.180
I'm sitting here holding a knife...

01:18:14.181 --> 01:18:17.771
In the middle of fucking Oklahoma...

01:18:17.779 --> 01:18:23.469
And I'm gonna stab the shit
out of anything that moves!

01:18:24.145 --> 01:18:28.745
That's all I've ever
wanted in a girlfriend.

01:18:33.310 --> 01:18:36.450
Everything is going to be okay.

01:18:38.942 --> 01:18:42.082
Everything is going to be okay.

01:20:11.693 --> 01:20:13.243
Ada, come here.

01:20:15.925 --> 01:20:19.155
Go ahead and pick out something.

01:20:58.850 --> 01:21:02.770
This is what it's like to be baptized.

01:21:03.317 --> 01:21:05.597
Let me show you again.

01:21:08.449 --> 01:21:10.459
That's a good girl.

01:21:10.583 --> 01:21:13.183
Now, let's get you clean.

01:21:17.281 --> 01:21:20.112
Oh, yeah, well all you do is drink!

01:21:20.113 --> 01:21:22.246
Well, that's the only thing I gotta
do because I gotta put up with you!

01:21:22.247 --> 01:21:23.747
Always excuses!

01:21:27.979 --> 01:21:30.344
Why don't you look in the
mirror once in a while?

01:21:30.345 --> 01:21:32.125
Get the fuck out!

01:21:32.778 --> 01:21:35.008
You're always leaving!

01:21:35.744 --> 01:21:39.664
Don't need you now, you piece of shit!

01:21:56.241 --> 01:21:58.881
Ada, come here. Come here.

01:22:00.273 --> 01:22:03.672
I want you to go upstairs
and get your toys.

01:22:03.673 --> 01:22:05.971
We're gonna stay with some friends
for a little while in Mansfield.

01:22:05.972 --> 01:22:07.932
Maybe a long while.

01:22:08.105 --> 01:22:10.025
Go one. Go get it.

01:22:16.804 --> 01:22:17.804
Del!

01:22:18.937 --> 01:22:20.487
Come back here!

01:22:20.736 --> 01:22:22.826
You misunderstood me!

01:22:24.602 --> 01:22:26.972
I would never hurt her.

01:22:27.735 --> 01:22:29.735
Whatever she said...

01:22:29.834 --> 01:22:30.834
She's...

01:25:37.767 --> 01:25:40.566
On the happy golden shore...

01:25:40.567 --> 01:25:43.977
Where the faithful part no more...

01:25:45.066 --> 01:25:47.198
When the storms of life are over...

01:25:47.199 --> 01:25:48.659
Meet me there.

01:25:52.265 --> 01:25:55.445
When the night dissolves away...

01:25:56.031 --> 01:25:58.851
Into pure and perfect day...

01:25:59.764 --> 01:26:02.544
I am coming home to stay...

01:26:02.563 --> 01:26:04.023
Meet me there.

01:26:06.029 --> 01:26:07.489
Meet me there.

01:26:09.629 --> 01:26:11.089
Meet me there.

01:26:14.761 --> 01:26:17.026
Where the Tree of Life is blooming...

01:26:17.027 --> 01:26:18.487
Meet me there.

01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:25.870
Where the faithful part no more...

01:26:26.192 --> 01:26:29.012
On the happy golden shore...

01:26:30.791 --> 01:26:33.756
Where the storms of life are over...

01:26:33.757 --> 01:26:35.217
Meet me there.

01:26:58.087 --> 01:27:00.507
My dad got it for us...

01:27:00.553 --> 01:27:02.718
He had been gone for a while.

01:27:02.719 --> 01:27:05.251
And, he got it for us for Christmas.

01:27:05.252 --> 01:27:09.532
I think he was trying
to outdo my mother.

01:27:09.551 --> 01:27:12.416
So, he got us this expensive thing.

01:27:12.417 --> 01:27:13.417
And...

01:27:15.184 --> 01:27:16.824
It was gigantic.

01:27:20.183 --> 01:27:24.448
He got it for both of us because
he didn't know either of us.

01:27:24.449 --> 01:27:26.229
We were so happy.

01:27:30.381 --> 01:27:33.613
But then the longer I looked at it...

01:27:33.614 --> 01:27:36.574
The more the happy went away.

01:27:40.412 --> 01:27:42.577
And the more I just...

01:27:42.578 --> 01:27:44.258
The bitterness...

01:27:44.745 --> 01:27:47.935
I would have rather had my dad.

01:27:55.343 --> 01:28:00.443
There's another one of
me talking on a toy phone.

01:28:01.009 --> 01:28:06.074
My grandfather had gotten it for me
for no particular reason from K-Mart.

01:28:06.075 --> 01:28:09.606
And, I used to pretend to call my dad...

01:28:09.607 --> 01:28:10.607
Um...

01:28:18.872 --> 01:28:21.871
I'm like four or five and
I'm just smiling my ass off...

01:28:21.872 --> 01:28:24.242
It's the stupidest toy.

01:28:27.337 --> 01:28:29.847
The more I look at it...

01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:35.000
The more the smile faded...

01:28:35.935 --> 01:28:37.435
I remembered...

01:28:39.902 --> 01:28:42.567
My grandfather calling my mom a "bitch."

01:28:42.568 --> 01:28:43.618
And her...

01:28:46.867 --> 01:28:51.737
Driving me out of there
and moving me to Texas.

01:28:54.199 --> 01:28:56.331
The only thing I can do to...

01:28:56.332 --> 01:28:58.652
Remember to be happy...

01:28:58.865 --> 01:29:01.465
Is to not think about it.

01:29:02.231 --> 01:29:03.691
Never go back.

01:29:10.829 --> 01:29:12.929
How do you feel now?

01:29:13.195 --> 01:29:14.195
Good.

01:29:15.262 --> 01:29:16.262
I think.

01:29:18.528 --> 01:29:19.528
Good.

01:29:23.228 --> 01:29:25.359
I'm not better. I'm still sad.

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:26.500
And scared.

01:29:29.526 --> 01:29:32.091
I don't know where I've
been or where I'm going...

01:29:32.092 --> 01:29:35.562
But I know it's going to be okay.

01:29:35.592 --> 01:29:38.732
Everything is going to be okay.

01:29:42.057 --> 01:29:44.189
Excuse me for a second...

01:29:44.190 --> 01:29:45.755
I'm gonna go get a soda.

01:29:45.756 --> 01:29:46.989
Do you want anything?

01:29:46.990 --> 01:29:48.770
A water, I guess.
