00:13.662 --> 00:14.492
Talk to me.

00:14.579 --> 00:19.288
Jack made it clear that the only way
to get proof is if CTU stays out of it.

00:19.376 --> 00:22.293
- We don't know if he's alive!
- He's on an open channel.

00:22.379 --> 00:24.917
You can't trace it, but you can talk to him.

00:25.882 --> 00:27.958
- Michelle!
- No, Jack, it's Tony.

00:28.051 --> 00:31.752
The president asked me for proof
that the Cyprus recording was fake.

00:31.847 --> 00:35.180
The man who can provide proof
will only deal with me.

00:35.267 --> 00:37.509
How do we know he's not using you?

00:37.602 --> 00:40.888
Ten commandos tried to kill him
to stop him making a deal with me.

00:40.981 --> 00:41.846
Jack.

00:41.940 --> 00:46.187
- I'm not gonna make it.
- Just tell me where the evidence is now.

00:46.278 --> 00:48.436
It's on a memory chip.

00:48.530 --> 00:53.275
The source recordings
prove the Cyprus audio is a fake.

00:53.368 --> 00:55.444
Where's the memory chip?

00:55.537 --> 00:57.328
Inside...

00:57.414 --> 01:00.415
Come on, Wallace. Inside where?

01:01.668 --> 01:03.293
Doctor!

01:03.378 --> 01:05.453
He's dead.

01:08.633 --> 01:10.709
We got the chip.

01:11.178 --> 01:13.254
Our planes are over the Atlantic.

01:13.346 --> 01:16.264
They will be reaching
their targets in three hours.

01:16.349 --> 01:20.299
The secretary of defence
wants to know how much longer

01:20.395 --> 01:23.349
you'll give Jack Bauer to
disprove that tape.

01:23.440 --> 01:27.983
Jack Bauer has up until the time
the planes start releasing bombs.

01:28.069 --> 01:31.735
From the secretary's point of view,
that's tying the DOD's hands.

01:31.823 --> 01:34.279
We're gonna utilise every moment we have.

01:34.367 --> 01:37.571
- He's not gonna like that.
- That's his problem.

01:46.630 --> 01:49.915
In order to exploit the advantages
of a surprise attack,

01:50.008 --> 01:53.958
we've launched 12 bomb squadrons
from three stateside bases.

01:54.054 --> 02:00.887
But initial air strikes will be launched from
our bases in the region here, here and here.

02:02.729 --> 02:07.058
Your request was for air strikes to begin
before your address to the nation.

02:07.150 --> 02:09.226
I know what I asked for.

02:12.072 --> 02:14.148
That came out wrong.

02:14.241 --> 02:18.950
You have done a remarkable job
mobilising our forces on such short notice.

02:19.037 --> 02:20.697
Thank you, sir.

02:20.789 --> 02:26.708
Mr President, is it fair to assume
that you're still behind the attack?

02:26.795 --> 02:30.460
Cos I'm sensing some equivocation.

02:32.551 --> 02:37.378
I told the vice president, but I haven't
shared this with the rest of you.

02:38.348 --> 02:42.761
Jack Bauer, the CTU agent most responsible
for finding the nuclear bomb,

02:42.853 --> 02:45.723
believes the Cyprus audio is fabricated.

02:45.814 --> 02:49.859
- Bauer has no hard evidence?
- Not at this point.

02:49.943 --> 02:56.195
This battle plan requires our surprising the
enemy with a strike of overwhelming force.

02:56.283 --> 02:59.865
We will lose that advantage
if we wait any longer.

02:59.953 --> 03:03.785
The target countries
will mobilise their defences

03:03.874 --> 03:08.085
and our casualties will increase
over the long term.

03:08.170 --> 03:11.206
- By how much?
- Up to 20,000 troops.

03:23.059 --> 03:25.515
Then we have no choice

03:25.604 --> 03:29.020
but to proceed with the plan as stated.

03:32.861 --> 03:37.856
What I have to say to the president will have
a direct impact on the meeting that he's in.

03:37.949 --> 03:43.406
- He can't be disturbed at this time.
- Fine. Just make sure he knows I called.

03:43.497 --> 03:48.739
He's in a meeting with the Joint Chiefs.
They won't interrupt until it's finished.

03:51.046 --> 03:52.505
Come on.

03:57.302 --> 03:59.211
- Almeida.
- It's Jack.

03:59.304 --> 04:00.473
Jack, where are you?

04:00.573 --> 04:03.883
Tony, I can barely hear you.
It's a bad connection.

04:03.975 --> 04:07.759
- I want you to bring Wallace back here now.
- Wallace is dead.

04:07.854 --> 04:13.774
But I got the evidence. It's a memory chip
containing the original source recordings.

04:13.860 --> 04:16.980
- How do you know it's real?
- He died trying to give it to me.

04:17.072 --> 04:18.317
He had it surgically implanted.

04:18.423 --> 04:22.528
I hardly think he'd have done
that if it wasn't authentic.

04:22.619 --> 04:26.913
- Where are you?
- In North Hollywood, 40 minutes from CTU.

04:26.998 --> 04:28.297
We'll bring you the chip now.

04:28.497 --> 04:30.782
Call in your route.
I'll send an aerial escort.

04:30.877 --> 04:33.424
Ok fine Tony. I need you to get in
touch with the president.

04:33.463 --> 04:37.165
He's in a meeting with the Joint Chiefs.
They won't patch me through.

04:37.259 --> 04:39.928
Jack, I'm not calling the president until
I confirm what you're holding is real.

04:40.011 --> 04:41.671
Jack, come here.

04:41.763 --> 04:44.634
You've got to at least
tell him what's going on.

04:44.724 --> 04:47.298
- I need you here, Jack.
- Tony, can you hear me?

04:47.394 --> 04:51.522
- I hear you, Jack.
- I gotta go. Please just do what I ask.

04:52.524 --> 04:55.441
- What?
- We can't go anywhere with this chip.

04:55.527 --> 04:58.398
- Look at this, embedded in the silicon.
- What is it?

04:58.488 --> 05:01.110
A transponder.
It acts like a tracking device.

05:01.199 --> 05:02.777
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

05:02.868 --> 05:06.201
Our group uses circuits like this
to track sensitive material.

05:06.288 --> 05:08.079
I don't understand.

05:08.165 --> 05:11.580
Whoever Wallace stole the chip from
tracked him to the warehouse.

05:11.668 --> 05:16.663
- They'll find us if I don't disconnect it.
- Can you avoid destroying the audio file?

05:16.756 --> 05:18.833
- I think so.
- Good.

05:22.095 --> 05:25.180
Danny, you have to stop doing this.
I told you not to call.

05:25.265 --> 05:28.764
I'm sorry you're upset,
but I don't have time for this right now.

05:28.852 --> 05:31.390
Why? What's going on?

05:31.480 --> 05:35.098
Nothing. Don't worry.
We're taking care of things here.

05:35.192 --> 05:38.643
Really? What am I supposed to do?

05:38.737 --> 05:41.500
Sit tight.
I'll call you when I get a chance.

05:41.600 --> 05:42.306
Forget it.

05:50.040 --> 05:52.163
Hey.

05:52.250 --> 05:54.326
Something's wrong with the phones.

05:54.419 --> 05:57.871
The network's been overloaded
since news of the bomb broke.

05:57.964 --> 06:01.333
- Who were you talking to?
- No one. What's going on?

06:01.426 --> 06:05.009
Jack just called. He says
he's got the evidence from Wallace.

06:05.097 --> 06:09.889
- Does the president know?
- We haven't confirmed it's authentic yet.

06:09.976 --> 06:13.392
The president's acting on the assumption
that the recording is real.

06:13.480 --> 06:17.312
And this evidence may prove
that it's not. I know.

06:17.400 --> 06:20.816
Tony, you've gotta call the president.

06:21.655 --> 06:23.731
I'm thinking about it.

06:28.203 --> 06:32.450
This is too big.
I need something with a finer point.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.416
What about this? Will that work?

06:37.504 --> 06:40.077
Yeah. Good.

06:44.386 --> 06:46.793
- How much longer do you need?
- A minute or two.

06:46.888 --> 06:49.260
- One or two?
- One if you stop bothering me.

06:49.349 --> 06:52.469
Those people who want
their chip back are here.

06:52.561 --> 06:55.016
Will the tracker still function?

06:55.105 --> 06:59.683
- The signal should still transmit.
- I think I can lure them away from here.

06:59.776 --> 07:03.988
- You and Kate get the chip over to CTU.
- Us?

07:04.072 --> 07:06.361
Don't worry. This is gonna work.

07:08.285 --> 07:11.488
Kate, move here against the wall.

07:21.756 --> 07:23.583
- Got it.
- Bring it here.

07:23.675 --> 07:26.344
Still locked on target?

07:26.428 --> 07:28.835
This way.

07:31.266 --> 07:35.809
OK. I want you to meet me at Moorpark
and Vineland, a few blocks west of here.

07:35.896 --> 07:41.732
If I'm not there in 15 minutes, leave without
me, but you get that chip to Tony Almeida.

07:41.818 --> 07:45.401
- Be careful.
- I'll be OK.

07:55.415 --> 07:57.491
Signal's dropping off.

07:59.211 --> 08:01.334
- Wait. He's moving.
- Where?

08:01.421 --> 08:05.289
Just ahead. Toward the east entrance.

08:08.095 --> 08:09.921
I'll catch up.

09:24.254 --> 09:28.667
I waited till the meeting broke to tell you
the governor called from Sacramento.

09:28.759 --> 09:31.428
- What's going on?
- People are hitting the streets.

09:31.511 --> 09:35.094
He wants you to dispatch
the National Guard like you did in Marietta.

09:35.182 --> 09:39.725
Mr President, Tony Almeida is holding
for you on the emergency Satcom network.

09:39.811 --> 09:41.092
Why on Satcom?

09:41.188 --> 09:44.770
Since news of the bomb got out,
network circuits have been overloaded.

09:44.858 --> 09:48.938
90% of all systems
went down a few minutes ago.

09:49.029 --> 09:53.655
- I can talk to Almeida if you want.
- Put him on speaker.

09:54.910 --> 09:58.243
Mr Almeida, this is President Palmer.

09:58.330 --> 10:01.117
You're also on with
Mike Novick and Lynne Kresge.

10:01.208 --> 10:04.292
Jack Bauer just called
with some new information.

10:04.377 --> 10:08.078
I'm a little conflicted about
contacting you with this.

10:08.173 --> 10:11.838
He has evidence that proves
the Cyprus recording is counterfeit.

10:11.927 --> 10:16.339
- What kind of evidence?
- Source recordings of each of the men.

10:16.431 --> 10:20.014
- They were then re-edited.
- Have these been authenticated?

10:20.102 --> 10:23.268
- Not yet. We're getting 'em soon.
- How soon?

10:23.355 --> 10:25.431
Within the hour, sir.

10:26.608 --> 10:30.024
Mr Almeida, your confidence
in Jack Bauer is curious.

10:30.112 --> 10:34.156
An hour ago you told me
he assaulted CTU personnel

10:34.241 --> 10:37.859
and took illegal custody of a witness.

10:37.953 --> 10:41.571
- He had no choice under the circumstances.
- I don't follow.

10:41.665 --> 10:47.785
The man with the evidence would not
have turned it over had Jack involved CTU.

10:47.879 --> 10:52.541
So what makes you so sure that this is
any more real than the Cyprus recording?

10:52.634 --> 10:55.255
That's just it, sir. I'm not.

10:55.345 --> 10:57.918
- But Jack Bauer is.
- Yes, sir.

11:02.602 --> 11:07.015
Thank you for your candour.
I'll take this information under advisement.

11:07.107 --> 11:09.812
Thank you, Mr President.

11:28.211 --> 11:31.497
I'm calling off the attack.

11:32.174 --> 11:35.958
Sir, before you do that, we should
talk through the consequences.

11:36.052 --> 11:38.508
We've talked enough, Mike.

11:38.597 --> 11:42.554
I appreciate your respect for Jack Bauer.
I do.

11:42.954 --> 11:44.849
But you know the man's reputation.

11:44.936 --> 11:47.262
I know the man.

11:47.355 --> 11:50.025
Then start thinking
about your own reputation.

11:50.108 --> 11:51.900
Meaning?

11:51.985 --> 11:55.188
A nuclear bomb was detonated on US soil.

11:55.280 --> 12:00.820
We've been shown proof connecting the
weapon to three nations in the Middle East.

12:00.911 --> 12:02.619
Proof that may be false.

12:02.704 --> 12:05.907
Unless you respond decisively,

12:05.999 --> 12:09.844
your enemies will exploit that
as a failure of leadership,

12:10.244 --> 12:12.203
as a sign of personal weakness.

12:12.297 --> 12:14.455
So what are you saying, Mike?

12:14.549 --> 12:19.674
That I should continue with a military
operation just to prove that I'm decisive?

12:19.763 --> 12:23.630
- What if Jack Bauer's right?
- What if he's wrong?

12:23.725 --> 12:26.643
Sir, we have all heard
the Pentagon's assessment.

12:26.728 --> 12:32.482
Stopping and restarting military action could
cost tens of thousands of American lives.

12:32.567 --> 12:39.021
An acceptable risk if the alternative is
waging war against three innocent countries.

12:39.116 --> 12:45.284
Mr President, we know from past experience
these countries aren't innocent.

12:45.372 --> 12:51.742
I'm urging you in the strongest
possible terms to reconsider.

13:05.684 --> 13:09.551
I've made up my mind.
Now get General Gratz back in here.

13:09.646 --> 13:11.888
Conference in the Joint Chiefs.

13:18.196 --> 13:21.316
They look fine. Send them to District.

13:22.242 --> 13:24.318
Excuse me.

13:27.581 --> 13:29.620
Hey. Look...

13:29.708 --> 13:34.536
I just wanted you to know
that I told the president about Jack.

13:34.629 --> 13:36.040
- You did?
- Yeah.

13:36.131 --> 13:40.425
If Jack has what he says he has,
the president should know about it.

13:40.510 --> 13:42.135
How did he react?

13:42.220 --> 13:46.966
He wants us to keep him
apprised of the situation.

13:47.058 --> 13:49.466
You did the right thing, Tony.

13:49.561 --> 13:52.134
We'll find out when Jack
gets here with that chip.

13:52.230 --> 13:54.804
- When did he say?
- About 20 minutes.

13:54.900 --> 13:57.817
When he does get here,
make sure that thing is real.

13:57.903 --> 14:00.904
I'll pull up the CPB software right now.

14:00.989 --> 14:03.029
All right. Thanks.

14:03.116 --> 14:05.275
Tony.

14:05.368 --> 14:06.993
Yeah?

14:07.078 --> 14:08.537
Thank you.

14:10.248 --> 14:11.363
Yeah.

14:18.507 --> 14:22.089
All circuits are busy.
Please try your call again.

14:22.177 --> 14:24.134
- Still no signal?
- I have signal.

14:24.221 --> 14:28.265
- I just can't get through.
- Maybe it's from CTU's end.

14:28.350 --> 14:32.217
I'm sure they're very busy
gearing up for the war against my country.

14:32.312 --> 14:35.230
There won't be a war, Yusuf.
They'll get the chip.

14:35.315 --> 14:39.229
- They're gonna know the truth.
- Assuming they want the truth.

14:39.319 --> 14:41.940
They don't want war.

14:42.030 --> 14:44.106
You sure about that?

14:50.580 --> 14:56.416
You might feel differently
if it was your family being threatened.

14:58.713 --> 15:02.248
- Vineland and Moorpark, right?
- Yeah.

15:17.482 --> 15:19.973
I'll keep an eye out for Jack.

15:21.987 --> 15:24.478
- He's in the northeast quadrant.
- Moving?

15:24.573 --> 15:26.612
- Just stopped.
- Davis, where are you?

15:26.700 --> 15:29.273
Sweeping north along the east wall.

15:29.369 --> 15:32.370
He's inside the northeast corner.
Pin him down.

15:32.456 --> 15:33.202
Yes, sir.

15:33.290 --> 15:37.537
- Do not kill him until I have that chip.
- Understood.

16:11.036 --> 16:14.202
He took the tracker off the chip.

16:14.289 --> 16:18.038
Ronnie, he's running north toward Magnolia.
Come on, let's go!

16:37.187 --> 16:40.390
All right, let's get him back inside.

16:57.290 --> 17:00.208
Is the president dedicated to this action?

17:00.293 --> 17:03.081
General, this was not
a decision he made lightly.

17:03.171 --> 17:09.044
- I haven't been briefed on this.
- The president will explain his decision.

17:09.136 --> 17:12.089
Until he does,
you should brief your own staff.

17:12.180 --> 17:17.222
- All right. I'll take care of it.
- Thank you for your patience.

17:17.310 --> 17:20.644
- More blowback?
- And then some.

17:20.730 --> 17:26.186
Mike, have you heard anything about
this meeting that the vice president called?

17:26.278 --> 17:27.392
A meeting?

17:27.487 --> 17:33.608
Apparently he's asked Cabinet members
to be on hand an hour and a half from now.

17:33.702 --> 17:36.952
- What's the agenda?
- I don't know, because I wasn't invited.

17:37.038 --> 17:40.454
- Who told you about this meeting?
- Someone on Gendler's staff.

17:40.542 --> 17:44.540
He doesn't know anything more
than what I'm telling you.

17:44.629 --> 17:48.709
Is it something to do with the president
calling off the military strikes?

17:48.800 --> 17:51.754
Mike, what else could it be?

17:51.845 --> 17:55.712
- Did you tell the president about this?
- No, not until I find out more.

17:55.807 --> 18:01.347
- For all I know, it could just be a rumour.
- That's probably all it is.

18:01.438 --> 18:06.859
- I'll ask around anyway.
- Keep me posted if you hear anything.

18:36.264 --> 18:38.423
- O'Hara.
- Where's Stark?

18:38.517 --> 18:40.593
Right here.

18:42.395 --> 18:44.721
Get him up. Yes?

18:44.815 --> 18:46.688
Ronnie, you got the chip?

18:46.775 --> 18:49.017
I'm with the agent who took it off Wallace.

18:49.111 --> 18:51.233
- It was Jack Bauer, wasn't it?
- Yes, sir.

18:51.321 --> 18:55.271
We've scanned his clothing
and induced vomiting to check his stomach.

18:55.367 --> 19:00.408
It's a waste of time. He's not gonna
have it on him. Let me talk to him.

19:05.252 --> 19:07.328
Yes, sir.

19:10.715 --> 19:12.791
You're on with Bauer.

19:13.969 --> 19:17.468
Jack, you're a hero here. Congratulations.

19:17.556 --> 19:19.797
Let me tell you what I wanna do.

19:19.891 --> 19:24.553
The world doesn't have to know anything
about the arrangement we're about to make.

19:24.646 --> 19:27.184
- We'll keep it private.
- Who am I talking to?

19:27.274 --> 19:35.613
Give me a break. Look, I need the chip.
So let's not be pigs here, all right?

19:35.949 --> 19:38.191
You tell Ronnie where it is,

19:38.285 --> 19:40.179
I authorise a very large sum,

19:40.279 --> 19:44.537
large enough to compensate you
for any guilt you might feel.

19:44.624 --> 19:45.953
It's not for sale.

19:46.042 --> 19:48.082
If someone wants to buy it, it is.

19:48.170 --> 19:52.547
How can you justify starting a war
just to profit from the outcome?

19:52.632 --> 19:55.550
We're just controlling
the chaos, that's all.

19:55.635 --> 19:58.305
No, you're causing it.

19:58.388 --> 20:03.928
Let's not waste each other's time
trying to bridge our differences, OK?

20:04.019 --> 20:08.230
There's only one thing
we need to agree on: a price.

20:08.315 --> 20:10.354
I already gave you my answer.

20:10.442 --> 20:12.897
When Ronnie's finished,
you'll give me another.

20:12.986 --> 20:15.607
No, my answer's final.

20:17.699 --> 20:19.074
Ronnie!

20:19.159 --> 20:21.282
I think he wants to talk to you.

20:23.288 --> 20:25.660
I heard. I'll get you your answer.

20:25.749 --> 20:28.204
This man Bauer, I've read his file.

20:28.293 --> 20:30.914
- So have I.
- You know he won't be easy to break.

20:31.004 --> 20:32.997
He'll break.

20:33.089 --> 20:35.759
- I appreciate your confidence.
- I've earned it.

20:35.842 --> 20:39.211
Yes, you have. There's also a time issue.

20:39.304 --> 20:42.839
Then you'd better let me get started, sir.

20:47.687 --> 20:49.763
The chip, Jack.

21:29.271 --> 21:31.513
The chip, Jack.

21:49.249 --> 21:51.574
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

21:51.668 --> 21:55.500
- Jack's bringing a chip in.
- That's what Tony said.

21:55.589 --> 21:57.749
He wants me to run point on the analysis.

21:57.849 --> 22:01.010
I'm having trouble
accessing the CPB software.

22:01.094 --> 22:03.336
Just send it to my screen. I'll do it.

22:03.430 --> 22:08.056
I just need you to...
unlock the indexing function.

22:08.143 --> 22:10.681
- I said I would do it.
- I don't need you to do it.

22:10.771 --> 22:13.087
I need you to unlock
the indexing function.

22:13.187 --> 22:14.720
What is your problem?

22:14.816 --> 22:18.481
- You've been gunning for me all day.
- I could say the same about you.

22:18.570 --> 22:22.402
I'm just trying to do my job.

22:23.825 --> 22:24.691
Dessler.

22:24.785 --> 22:28.533
- Can I see you up here a second?
- Yeah, sure.

22:30.081 --> 22:32.573
- Just do what I asked.
- Fine.

22:45.430 --> 22:47.672
- So what was that about?
- What?

22:47.766 --> 22:50.091
You and Carrie,
what were you arguing about?

22:50.185 --> 22:55.524
Nothing. I asked her to open some software
and she's making me jump through hoops.

22:55.607 --> 22:57.683
I know you don't wanna tell me,

22:57.776 --> 23:02.485
but whatever bad blood there is between
the two of you, I gotta know what it is.

23:02.572 --> 23:05.526
It doesn't matter, especially today.

23:05.617 --> 23:07.387
It's exactly why it does matter.

23:07.472 --> 23:11.406
It's interfering with your work.
What's the problem?

23:16.044 --> 23:21.121
When I worked for Carrie over at Division,
we were friends.

23:22.008 --> 23:26.552
I introduced her to my brother.
He was married. He had kids.

23:26.638 --> 23:29.307
He left them for her.

23:29.391 --> 23:32.724
And then she got bored. She dumped him.

23:34.020 --> 23:39.097
Danny lost everything. His family, his job.

23:42.654 --> 23:45.988
It got so bad, he tried to kill himself.

23:50.245 --> 23:52.451
Look...

23:52.539 --> 23:57.165
It's unfortunate you two have to
work together, but you do.

23:57.252 --> 24:01.297
And I gotta keep this office
running today, all right?

24:01.381 --> 24:04.216
- I understand.
- Good.

24:10.807 --> 24:11.637
Almeida.

24:11.725 --> 24:15.888
- Can I speak with Michelle?
- Just a second.

24:15.979 --> 24:18.055
It's for you.

24:18.857 --> 24:22.024
- Dessler.
- Your brother Danny's here to see you.

24:22.110 --> 24:25.728
Show him to my station. I'll be right down.

24:28.241 --> 24:30.530
Are we OK here?

24:30.619 --> 24:32.113
Yeah.

24:45.300 --> 24:47.376
Wow. This is nuts.

24:51.056 --> 24:53.594
Hey. Hey, little sister.

24:53.683 --> 24:56.221
Thanks for bringing him in.

24:56.728 --> 24:58.935
- How are you? You OK?
- I'm fine.

24:59.022 --> 25:02.438
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to talk to you.

25:02.526 --> 25:04.814
- We were talking and you hung up.
- I know.

25:04.903 --> 25:08.023
I tried to call you back,
but the phones weren't working.

25:08.115 --> 25:11.530
So you came here at 2.30 in the morning.
I don't have time for this.

25:11.618 --> 25:15.912
I wanted to apologise to you face to face.

25:15.997 --> 25:18.951
I'm sorry that I yelled at you before.
I'm sorry.

25:19.042 --> 25:21.414
Apology accepted. But you have to go now.

25:21.503 --> 25:23.828
It's just this whole thing with the bomb.

25:23.922 --> 25:27.623
It's not just me. A lot of people
are afraid of what's gonna happen next.

25:27.717 --> 25:30.387
Nobody knows what to do, you know?

25:31.763 --> 25:34.800
It's gonna be OK.
We're taking care of things here.

25:34.891 --> 25:36.967
I know. I know you are.

25:38.228 --> 25:44.147
Why don't you go home and get some sleep?
I'll come over as soon as I can.

25:44.234 --> 25:46.939
- Ignore her.
- You didn't tell me Carrie works here.

25:47.028 --> 25:50.611
She's not working here.
We were short-handed. Danny, please.

25:50.699 --> 25:53.024
You don't return my calls?

25:53.118 --> 25:55.609
- Who are you?
- My sister works here.

25:55.704 --> 25:58.129
Look, I've been in the middle
of things right now.

25:58.329 --> 26:00.247
I was just worried about you.

26:00.333 --> 26:03.085
- I was hoping you'd be worried about me.
- Stop.

26:03.170 --> 26:07.463
- Why? You taking Carrie's side now?
- Of course not. Come to my station.

26:07.549 --> 26:11.250
- Hey, come here. I wanna talk to you.
- Danny!

26:13.138 --> 26:16.092
Why didn't you call me back?

26:20.353 --> 26:23.520
Tell them I'm your brother, Michelle!

26:40.248 --> 26:42.324
Lynne.

26:47.964 --> 26:50.040
You were right about the meeting.

26:50.133 --> 26:53.336
Prescott's calling Cabinet members
personally to set it up.

26:53.428 --> 26:55.966
Is it about the president
calling off the attack?

26:56.056 --> 27:00.634
I don't know yet. My source at Defence says
he has information. He agreed to meet me.

27:00.727 --> 27:03.135
- Who is it?
- Jesper Isberg.

27:03.230 --> 27:06.812
He won't tell me anything over the phone.

27:06.900 --> 27:10.067
- When are you meeting him?
- Now.

27:10.153 --> 27:11.268
Where?

27:11.363 --> 27:14.946
I don't think you should be there, Lynne.
You might spook him.

27:15.033 --> 27:16.698
Mike, I'm the one who brought you into this.

27:16.798 --> 27:21.914
Now I wanna hear what's going on first hand
before we take this to the president.

27:21.998 --> 27:25.367
There's a room upstairs, 522.
It's used for storage.

27:25.460 --> 27:27.536
I'll meet you there.

27:45.772 --> 27:47.848
I'll be right back.

27:54.865 --> 27:56.941
Michelle?

27:58.660 --> 28:00.949
Where are you going?

28:01.037 --> 28:03.326
I was just going over to IT.

28:03.415 --> 28:07.282
I'm still trying to access the CPB software.

28:07.377 --> 28:09.453
IT's the other way.

28:11.590 --> 28:15.338
I just... I just need a minute, Tony.

28:16.720 --> 28:18.594
Hey.

28:19.431 --> 28:21.507
Carrie's gonna be fine.

28:24.561 --> 28:27.930
Is she gonna...
Is she gonna press charges?

28:28.023 --> 28:30.146
No, I don't think so.

28:32.027 --> 28:35.811
It's all my fault.
I should've seen it coming.

28:35.906 --> 28:40.698
It's family. These things happen.
You can't see it coming.

28:41.787 --> 28:46.080
He's my brother. I mean, his kids...

28:49.002 --> 28:52.751
Maybe I should have
told him about the bomb.

28:53.799 --> 28:56.290
It was a tough choice, but you made it.

28:56.384 --> 28:59.089
And, by the way, you were right.

28:59.971 --> 29:01.929
No.

29:02.015 --> 29:05.218
Nothing I've done today is right.

29:05.310 --> 29:06.389
Michelle.

29:06.478 --> 29:09.681
All these people today that are dead.

29:10.899 --> 29:15.276
And then this recording.
I don't know if we're right about that.

29:15.362 --> 29:16.239
I can't...

29:16.539 --> 29:18.945
I can't do this any more, Tony. I can't.

29:19.032 --> 29:22.152
Michelle. Come here, come here.

29:23.453 --> 29:26.787
I'm so tired. I'm so scared.

29:26.873 --> 29:28.249
It's OK.

29:29.709 --> 29:32.794
It's OK. It's all right.

29:50.814 --> 29:52.890
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

30:06.204 --> 30:07.864
Tony.

30:07.956 --> 30:10.198
Chapelle's looking for you.

30:10.292 --> 30:12.664
Yeah, OK.

30:39.488 --> 30:41.564
Jack?

30:57.547 --> 30:59.006
Jack.

32:01.361 --> 32:03.021
Come on, Jack.

32:09.828 --> 32:13.197
You're gonna kill him.
You can't keep doing this.

32:15.041 --> 32:18.042
Don't ever touch me again.

32:48.408 --> 32:51.326
- Yes?
- Have you made any progress?

32:51.411 --> 32:54.827
- We're still working on him.
- I told you, there's a time issue.

32:54.915 --> 32:56.872
Yes, sir. You told me.

32:56.958 --> 33:01.953
You do not wanna disappoint me on this.
Get me that chip, Stark.

33:04.341 --> 33:06.168
I will.

33:25.320 --> 33:29.781
- So where's this person we're meeting?
- He'll be here soon.

33:29.866 --> 33:33.946
Have you heard anything else about
why Prescott called this meeting?

33:34.037 --> 33:36.445
We knew there'd be consequences, Lynne,

33:36.540 --> 33:41.367
dissent within the administration,
but nothing like this.

33:41.461 --> 33:43.086
Like what, Mike?

33:43.171 --> 33:47.418
What do you know about Section 4
of the 25th Amendment?

33:48.635 --> 33:53.630
It provides that if the majority of his Cabinet
feels he's unfit to fulfil his duties

33:53.723 --> 33:56.641
that the president could be
removed from office.

33:56.726 --> 34:01.104
And the vice president
becomes acting president.

34:02.399 --> 34:04.475
Prescott can't do that.

34:06.445 --> 34:09.978
Mike, we're talking about a palace coup.

34:11.116 --> 34:13.440
- Jesper Isberg?
- Yeah.

34:13.534 --> 34:15.693
Give us a moment, please.

34:19.833 --> 34:24.661
Before we talk to him, I need to know where
you stand vis-à-vis the president's decision.

34:24.754 --> 34:26.913
Mike, are you questioning my loyalty?

34:27.007 --> 34:33.341
There's going to be a lot of lobbying among
the Cabinet. I need to know where you stand.

34:33.429 --> 34:36.188
Look, I may not agree with
the president's decision,

34:36.289 --> 34:38.175
but it was his decision to make.

34:38.268 --> 34:44.306
As far as I'm concerned, it's Prescott
who should be charged with treason.

34:44.399 --> 34:46.771
Are you sure that's how you feel?

34:46.860 --> 34:48.936
Yes, Mike.

34:50.362 --> 34:53.364
I was afraid you'd say that, Lynne.

34:54.451 --> 34:56.527
Mr Isberg.

35:02.834 --> 35:05.123
I'm sorry.

35:05.212 --> 35:09.541
What are you doing?
Where are you going? Mike?

35:11.635 --> 35:13.711
Oh, my God.

35:14.763 --> 35:16.637
You're with Prescott?

35:16.723 --> 35:20.768
Only because David
wouldn't listen to reason.

35:21.645 --> 35:25.014
- You said so yourself.
- Mike, you can't...

35:25.774 --> 35:29.357
We've been worried about
his indecisiveness since he took office.

35:29.444 --> 35:32.896
And now it's going to cost
the lives of 20,000 Americans.

35:32.989 --> 35:35.694
I can't let that happen.

35:36.952 --> 35:39.240
I'm doing this for the good of the country.

35:39.329 --> 35:43.908
Lie to yourself all you want.
Don't you dare lie to me.

35:45.585 --> 35:47.708
- I'm sorry.
- Mike, this is not...

35:47.796 --> 35:51.331
What are you doing? Mike! Mike!

35:53.969 --> 35:56.045
Open this door!

35:56.972 --> 35:58.845
Open this door!

35:58.932 --> 36:03.559
Until you hear from me -
only me - do not let her out.

36:03.645 --> 36:05.721
Understood.

36:06.815 --> 36:08.891
Open this door!

36:24.166 --> 36:26.039
Open this door!

36:26.126 --> 36:28.617
The White House confirms the explosion.

36:28.655 --> 36:32.710
The president will address
the nation shortly.

36:32.799 --> 36:37.876
Police have reported a number of hate crimes
against Middle Eastern businesses.

36:37.971 --> 36:43.131
Authorities are urging people to stay
inside their homes and off the street.

36:47.314 --> 36:51.014
- Jack said to leave without him.
- Let's give him another minute.

36:51.109 --> 36:55.321
We've given him much longer
than he asked for already.

36:55.405 --> 36:59.403
We have to get this chip to CTU.
They're expecting it.

36:59.493 --> 37:01.818
What if Jack needs our help?

37:01.912 --> 37:05.031
Getting this to CTU is the priority.

37:14.174 --> 37:16.546
- You OK?
- Yeah. You?

37:16.635 --> 37:18.343
Yeah.

37:18.428 --> 37:20.670
- Hey!
- Hey!

37:21.556 --> 37:23.134
He's a damn towel head.

37:23.225 --> 37:28.599
Your people tried killing us with that bomb.
You're not getting a second chance.

37:30.857 --> 37:36.693
Get back. Get back, put your hands up,
get down on the pavement.

37:36.780 --> 37:39.615
Facedown! Hands where I can see 'em! Now!

37:39.699 --> 37:42.190
- Do what he says.
- Your turn.

37:43.328 --> 37:45.404
Get down.

37:47.499 --> 37:49.657
Kate, get back in the car.

37:54.506 --> 37:56.914
Yusuf! Behind you!

37:57.759 --> 37:59.419
No!

38:00.220 --> 38:02.509
Think twice next time you come here!

38:02.597 --> 38:06.465
Stop it! You don't know what you're doing!

38:19.406 --> 38:20.437
Chapelle.

38:20.532 --> 38:24.150
Ryan, it's Tony Almeida.
I was told you were trying to reach me.

38:24.244 --> 38:29.155
Thanks for getting back to me so soon.
Congratulations on the promotion.

38:29.249 --> 38:32.203
I wish it could have been
under better circumstances.

38:32.294 --> 38:36.291
- Yeah, Mason was a good man.
- Yeah, he was.

38:36.381 --> 38:41.720
- We're pretty busy around here.
- I just wanted to give you a heads-up.

38:41.803 --> 38:45.967
- About what?
- I'm on my way over from Division.

38:46.057 --> 38:46.971
Why?

38:47.058 --> 38:51.103
I thought you could use some help,
with all that's going on.

38:51.188 --> 38:53.643
We're doing pretty well here, Ryan. Thanks.

38:53.732 --> 38:57.101
I'm sure you are.
I'll see you in 30 minutes.

39:15.295 --> 39:17.371
- Dessler.
- Hey.

39:17.464 --> 39:20.169
Have you heard anything
about your brother yet?

39:20.258 --> 39:25.335
Yeah. They sedated him.
They said they'd call me when he wakes up.

39:27.015 --> 39:29.720
- How are you holding up?
- OK.

39:30.894 --> 39:32.970
- You?
- I'm OK.

39:37.400 --> 39:39.974
Listen...

39:40.070 --> 39:43.984
About what happened before.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have...

39:44.074 --> 39:46.695
No, don't. Don't be sorry.

39:48.286 --> 39:50.362
I'm not.

39:53.333 --> 39:55.409
Really?

39:56.586 --> 39:58.662
Really.

40:02.759 --> 40:06.093
- What about Carrie?
- Don't worry about Carrie.

40:06.179 --> 40:08.338
I know her. She's not gonna let this go.

40:08.432 --> 40:12.761
It's none of her business. It's gonna be OK.

40:12.853 --> 40:14.929
All right.

40:26.908 --> 40:29.197
Wake him up.

40:31.413 --> 40:35.874
- We should probably give him a minute.
- Wake him up.

40:44.384 --> 40:46.756
You've been on this side before, Jack.

40:46.845 --> 40:50.178
You know everybody has a limit
to how much they can take.

40:50.265 --> 40:53.219
Everybody has a breaking point.

40:53.977 --> 40:56.053
Even you.

40:58.523 --> 41:02.651
I understand you've got
a daughter. Is it Kim?

41:11.953 --> 41:16.117
You wouldn't want Kim
to be an orphan, would you?

41:24.925 --> 41:27.001
Hit him.

41:41.858 --> 41:43.602
Again.

41:43.693 --> 41:46.184
He's no good to us dead.

41:59.584 --> 42:01.956
Wake him up.

42:15.475 --> 42:17.551
Wake him up.

42:21.356 --> 42:25.224
- What's the problem?
- He's not responding.

42:43.587 --> 42:46.588
- He's dead.
- Cut him down!

42:51.052 --> 42:53.128
Outta the way!

42:54.598 --> 42:57.005
Get some epinephrine!

42:57.100 --> 42:59.591
Clear his airway.

43:00.937 --> 43:03.263
- Where's that epinephrine?
- There isn't any.

43:03.356 --> 43:05.847
Go find some!
