00:00.666 --> 00:04.807
- Hey, after the kid goes back to his mother
you wanna go out and grab some dinner?

00:04.808 --> 00:08.150
- I can't go out to dinner, Charlie.
- Why not? You got a date...

00:08.151 --> 00:12.191
...I said knowing the aswer
but asking anyway just to be polite...

00:12.435 --> 00:15.059
"No I don't have a date,"
he replied all the while thinking:

00:15.060 --> 00:18.832
"Bite me you boozed bufoon"

00:18.833 --> 00:21.511
- So why can't you go?
- Are you kidding?

00:21.512 --> 00:23.494
I'm paying alimony to two women.

00:23.495 --> 00:26.027
I dont have money for
luxuries like eating out.

00:26.028 --> 00:28.193
...or eating in, really.

00:28.194 --> 00:31.544
I'm trying to learn
to chew my own cud.

00:31.545 --> 00:34.875
- That's allright. I'll treat.
- No, you've done too much for me already.

00:34.876 --> 00:37.966
Yeah but it's not like I'm keeping a tab
... 26,382 dollars...

00:40.604 --> 00:41.694
...to date.

00:42.765 --> 00:45.835
Exactly, so... so I need to start
carrying my own weight.

00:45.836 --> 00:49.921
Wich is actually getting easier
now that I'm wasting away.

00:49.922 --> 00:53.068
- Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
- I'm not feeling sorry for myself.

00:53.069 --> 00:56.868
I'll find something here to eat.
Maybe some scrambled eggs and a...

00:56.869 --> 00:57.789
...popsickle.

00:58.919 --> 01:01.069
Fine. See you later.

01:08.344 --> 01:11.604
Allright. I'm only gonna
ask you one more time.

01:11.831 --> 01:15.238
- Would you like to have dinner with me?
- That depends. Where are we going?

01:15.239 --> 01:16.799
Oh, for God's sake!

01:17.318 --> 01:19.919
- What? What, I don't even get a vote?
- No, you don't get a vote,

01:19.920 --> 01:21.333
you get a free meal.

01:21.334 --> 01:26.151
If I was one of your dates,
you'd ask where wanna go.

01:26.152 --> 01:26.962
You're right.

01:29.527 --> 01:31.857
So where do you wanna go, baby?

01:32.681 --> 01:33.912
That's very funny...

01:33.913 --> 01:36.098
No no no let's get
someting hot in you

01:36.099 --> 01:38.479
and some hot in here.

01:38.950 --> 01:39.990
Knock it off!

01:41.059 --> 01:43.218
- Gee, you smell good...
- You know what? Ok, ok.

01:43.219 --> 01:45.248
I'll just stay here
and have a popsicle.

01:45.249 --> 01:46.751
Oh, you'll be gettin' a popsicle.

01:46.752 --> 01:49.455
Fine. Ok, You pick the restaurant.

01:49.456 --> 01:51.206
Thank you.
How about sushi?

01:51.546 --> 01:53.406
Uh... not a big fan.

01:55.328 --> 01:57.308
That's Judith. Keep thinking!

02:00.685 --> 02:02.425
Jake, your mother's here.

02:04.937 --> 02:06.337
Hey, that popsicle...

02:18.022 --> 02:19.822
- Hello.
- Hi. Yeah, he'll be right down.

02:20.751 --> 02:23.591
Do me a favor and take'em both.

02:26.014 --> 02:27.084
Hey mom.

02:27.085 --> 02:29.483
Hey honey, would you
wait in the car, please?

02:29.484 --> 02:32.642
- Who's in trouble, me or dad?
- No one's in trouble.

02:32.643 --> 02:33.713
It's you.

02:35.940 --> 02:38.467
Judith, if you gonna chew
my ass off, just know...

02:38.468 --> 02:41.968
I'm planning on having it
for breakfast tomorrow.

02:42.285 --> 02:45.437
No, you didn't do anything Alan.
I just, uh...

02:45.438 --> 02:47.068
I want to let you know that...

02:48.281 --> 02:49.851
Boy this is awkward...

02:49.994 --> 02:52.059
You remember I was dating
Jake's pediatrician.

02:52.060 --> 02:54.500
Yeah, yeah, Melnick.
What about him?

02:54.579 --> 02:58.069
Well, we started seeing each
other again and it's serious.

02:58.266 --> 02:59.366
Oh. How serious?

03:01.033 --> 03:03.883
He asked me to marry him
and I said yes.

03:06.177 --> 03:07.237
Wow.

03:07.351 --> 03:08.941
I... I don't know what to say...

03:11.100 --> 03:13.510
- I guess congratulations.
- Thank you.

03:13.523 --> 03:16.082
Just wanted to let you know
before we told Jake.

03:16.083 --> 03:17.663
Sure, sure. I appreciate it.

03:18.101 --> 03:20.154
It's kind of weird,
isn't it, I mean...

03:20.155 --> 03:21.784
So many years together

03:21.785 --> 03:25.925
It's hard for me to think of you
to marry somebody else.

03:29.812 --> 03:35.182
- Still, I wish you the best.
- I know you do. Thank you.

03:35.457 --> 03:37.157
- Well, bye.
- Bye.

You know what problem with sushi?

04:24.095 --> 04:27.005
You mean besides eating it
with you?

04:27.259 --> 04:29.409
It's all feshy and flappy and wet.

04:29.843 --> 04:32.183
Feels unnatural against my tongue.

04:32.518 --> 04:33.968
- Hey Allan?
- What?

04:34.015 --> 04:37.805
I think I know why your
marriages didn't work out.

04:38.477 --> 04:40.167
Oh, stop it.
Now...

04:40.917 --> 04:43.613
Speaking of marriages, the next
time we go out to dinner

04:43.614 --> 04:47.237
it'll be on me. Because with
Judith getting married agan...

04:47.238 --> 04:48.318
I'll have...

<i>No more alimony.

04:56.879 --> 04:57.949
Hey dad.

04:58.553 --> 05:01.475
What are you doing here?
How did you get in?

05:01.476 --> 05:04.166
- Rose let me in.
- Hey guys.

05:04.627 --> 05:06.137
How was dinner?

05:06.354 --> 05:08.882
Forget dinner,
what are you doing here?

05:08.883 --> 05:10.693
Keeping Jake accompanied.

05:11.037 --> 05:13.943
But if you let him in
you'd have to be here before him.

05:13.944 --> 05:15.044
Well, yeah.

05:15.683 --> 05:17.551
But if Jake hadn't shown up

05:17.552 --> 05:21.041
I'd be gone by now and
you'd never know I was here

05:21.042 --> 05:24.652
So what? You just waltz in and make
yourself at home whenever I'm out?

05:24.653 --> 05:28.553
That's not true.
Sometimes you're upstairs asleep.

05:29.242 --> 05:30.990
Wait a minute
Let's go back here.

05:30.991 --> 05:33.713
- Jake, why aren't you at your mother's?
- I ran away.

05:33.714 --> 05:36.104
Sometimes you're in the shower.

05:37.167 --> 05:39.163
Rose, please.
Why did you run away?

05:39.164 --> 05:40.734
Because I hate it there.

05:41.125 --> 05:43.590
Is this about the upcoming nuptials?

05:43.591 --> 05:46.381
It's nothing to do with puberty, dad.

05:47.803 --> 05:50.293
It's about mom getting married.

05:51.339 --> 05:54.431
- I thought you like Dr. Melnick.
- That was when they were just dating.

05:54.432 --> 05:57.516
Nowadays they can tell me
what to do. He's not my father.

05:57.517 --> 05:59.099
You don't do what
I tell you what to do.

05:59.100 --> 06:02.240
Yeah, but mom doesn't
care about that.

06:02.774 --> 06:04.747
Alan, if I'd just interrupt
for one second...

06:04.748 --> 06:07.928
How do you keep getting in?
I've changed the locks three times.

06:07.929 --> 06:10.199
Yes, but you didn't change the locksmith.

06:12.833 --> 06:14.473
I could recommend somebody.

06:16.421 --> 06:19.571
- Goodnight Rose.
- I replace everything I eat.

06:20.622 --> 06:22.438
- Goodnight Rose.
- You know how I do it?

06:22.439 --> 06:25.318
I keep an exact duplicate
fridge in my house.

06:25.319 --> 06:29.009
- Goodnight Rose.
- By the way we're out of popsicles.

06:30.716 --> 06:33.219
Allright. I'm gonna call your mother.
She's probably worried sick.

06:33.220 --> 06:36.960
She's probably in the
hot tub with Dr. Melnick.

06:38.185 --> 06:40.934
How did you get here.
You steal a car or something?

06:40.935 --> 06:43.613
How could I steal a car?
I'm twelve.

06:43.614 --> 06:47.704
New kids these days.
No imagination...

06:48.394 --> 06:51.281
- I took the bus.
- In L.A.? At night?

06:51.282 --> 06:53.732
Even safer stealing a car!

06:54.215 --> 06:56.319
So, what's your plan?
Where are you headed.

06:56.320 --> 06:57.420
I'm gonna stay here.

06:58.854 --> 07:00.364
Oh, you can't stay here.

07:02.019 --> 07:04.703
- Why not?
- Because you're running away.

07:04.704 --> 07:08.723
Away according to the dictionary
means not here.

07:08.724 --> 07:12.110
It's usually preceeded
by the words far far

07:12.111 --> 07:13.731
or in your case:
"Go".

07:15.305 --> 07:17.565
Come on. Why can't I
live with you guys?

07:17.566 --> 07:19.932
Oh Jake, do you have any idea how much

07:19.933 --> 07:22.564
I have to clean up my act
when you're here on weekends?

07:22.565 --> 07:27.053
What are you talking about? I see you drink,
gamble, you have strange girls sleep over.

07:27.054 --> 07:31.650
Drop in unannounced on a wednesday,
and you'll be scarred for life.

07:31.651 --> 07:34.111
I hope you're proud of yourself.
Your mother's crying.

07:34.112 --> 07:35.152
Good.

07:37.199 --> 07:39.831
- Don't be mean to your mother!
- You're mean to your mother.

07:39.832 --> 07:41.402
My mother can take it.

07:41.833 --> 07:43.403
She actually feeds on it.

07:44.705 --> 07:48.034
Anyway she wanted to tell you that
she loves you more than anything.

07:48.035 --> 07:50.482
and that she and Dr. Melnick
aren't gonna get married,

07:50.483 --> 07:53.349
until you've had time
to adjust to the idea.

07:53.350 --> 07:58.130
Well then they are never married
cause I'm never gonna adjust to it!

07:59.636 --> 08:02.266
- Five, six, seven...
- Shut up!

08:05.725 --> 08:07.895
You know I'm a
little surprised at you.

08:07.896 --> 08:09.661
I would think you would want
your mom to be happy.

08:09.662 --> 08:11.732
Hey! She can be happy
all she wants.

08:11.733 --> 08:14.570
I just don't need some jerk
pretending he's my dad.

08:14.571 --> 08:15.491
Why not?

08:16.398 --> 08:18.060
Cause I already have a dad.

08:18.061 --> 08:19.671
And he's already a jerk.

08:22.084 --> 08:23.258
Alright buddy.

08:23.259 --> 08:26.289
I'm gonna have to tell you
something pretty heavy

08:26.500 --> 08:30.834
but I think it's something that
you're old enough to understand.

08:30.835 --> 08:33.034
You can do better than me.

08:33.801 --> 08:34.731
Way better.

08:36.966 --> 08:40.678
Did you know that I'm not even a
real doctor but Dr. Melnick is.

08:40.679 --> 08:43.068
- So what?
- So what? Are you kidding?

08:43.140 --> 08:46.478
He maks more money than I do.
He can buy you better presents than I can.

08:46.479 --> 08:50.634
Don't underestimate the value of having
a prescription pad lying around the house.

08:50.635 --> 08:53.915
- Charlie!
- You know, someone gets sick.

08:53.978 --> 08:55.028
...or bored.

08:56.240 --> 08:59.577
- But I only need one dad.
- And you'll only have one dad

08:59.578 --> 09:03.214
there's nothing that says you
can't call him dad and me Alan.

09:03.215 --> 09:05.615
We still know who's who.

09:05.912 --> 09:07.482
I'm getting a little misty...

09:10.715 --> 09:12.935
Forget it. I'm never gonna like him.

09:13.473 --> 09:16.757
May I suggest you try a more
... shall we say...

09:16.758 --> 09:17.988
...practical aproach.

09:21.982 --> 09:24.712
Jake, how much does your
mom give you for allowance?

09:25.806 --> 09:27.436
Ten dollars a week.

09:27.992 --> 09:28.992
Ok...

09:30.733 --> 09:33.183
I'm gonna write down
some figures here and...

09:33.705 --> 09:37.321
you tell me to stop when you see a
number that makes you feel a little...

09:37.322 --> 09:39.892
warmer towards Dr. Melnick.

09:44.617 --> 09:47.671
I was so worried about you,
don't you ever do that again.

09:47.672 --> 09:50.325
- Thanks for bringing him back.
- No problem.

09:50.326 --> 09:53.536
- Jake, isn't there something you wanna say?
- No.

09:54.374 --> 09:55.884
I love you Dr. Melnick.

10:08.516 --> 10:10.877
Come on honey, let's get you to bed,
you've got school in the morning.

10:10.878 --> 10:11.798
Hang on.

10:13.818 --> 10:15.968
Night dad.
See you Alan.

10:17.366 --> 10:18.526
Night buddy.

10:19.083 --> 10:21.293
Boy, he's really warming up to you.

10:21.607 --> 10:22.477
Yeah. Listen..

10:22.736 --> 10:27.831
If you and Judith ever discussed putting
Jake on any sort of medication?

10:27.832 --> 10:29.442
Why, what do you got?

10:30.621 --> 10:32.933
No, no we haven't. Why?

10:32.934 --> 10:35.871
Well, I mean... one minute he hates me,
the next minute he loves me

10:35.872 --> 10:38.023
and those kind of a moodswings
just aren't normal.

10:38.024 --> 10:41.534
Oh, no. Don't worry about that.
That's not an emotional problem,

10:41.535 --> 10:42.575
that's more like a...

10:44.171 --> 10:45.151
...kind of...

10:46.588 --> 10:49.748
- Charlie?
- We paid him to like you.

10:50.033 --> 10:53.883
- You what?
- And it costs less than you might think.

10:55.220 --> 10:56.689
But that's a good thing,

10:56.690 --> 10:59.494
a bribable child is a controllable child.

10:59.495 --> 11:03.003
Plus he's not too bright so
you can lie to him all you want.

11:03.004 --> 11:04.427
- Charlie?
- Oh, come on!

11:04.428 --> 11:09.398
Until he was ten I had him convinced
that swizzle sticks were money.

11:12.424 --> 11:16.363
Hey, speaking of swizzle sticks have you
guys considered eloping to Vegas?

11:16.364 --> 11:19.001
- No, we haven't...
- No, I know what you're thinking. Tacky.

11:19.002 --> 11:20.622
But actually it isn't.

11:20.977 --> 11:22.970
It's classy and very romantic.

11:22.971 --> 11:25.789
Yeah, and some of the hotel rooms
have those big mirror walls.

11:25.790 --> 11:30.450
It's like watching your ass
bob up and down in I-MAX.

11:32.559 --> 11:35.351
I think I actually put things
on hold for a little while.

11:35.352 --> 11:37.756
Why? You Love Judith, don't you?

11:37.757 --> 11:41.649
- Of course, she's a great woman.
- How's the sex?

11:41.650 --> 11:43.560
It's a little personal, isn't it?

11:43.612 --> 11:46.652
Hey, I didn't ask wich way you point her.

11:46.655 --> 11:49.017
Just wanna make sure you
two kids are compatible.

11:49.018 --> 11:51.468
Oh! Well there's no problem
in that area.

11:51.751 --> 11:53.671
See Alan?
It was you.

11:59.022 --> 12:02.042
That's me. The original
one pump chump.

12:03.547 --> 12:04.927
So I hear.

12:06.392 --> 12:09.664
The thing is I'm just not sure
I'm ready to be a stepfather.

12:09.665 --> 12:12.350
Oh, sure you are. You'll be terrific.
Right Charlie?

12:12.351 --> 12:15.120
Trust us, as long as there's food in
the fridge and money in your wallet,

12:15.121 --> 12:17.123
you'll own the little pecker.

12:17.124 --> 12:20.754
I think he was exhausted, he fell asleep
as soon as his head hit the pillow.

12:20.755 --> 12:23.180
Another plus, sound sleeper.

12:23.181 --> 12:24.407
Yeah, nothing wakes the kid up

12:24.408 --> 12:28.538
and I've
had some real screamers at my place.

12:28.887 --> 12:30.913
It's getting a little late,
I'd like to go to bed.

12:30.914 --> 12:33.725
Why don't you do that?
Listen, fatherhood is no big deal.

12:33.726 --> 12:37.996
Truth is with the internet and everything
they practically raise themselves.

12:37.997 --> 12:38.997
Alan!

12:39.566 --> 12:42.886
You go ahead honey, I'll be in a second...

12:43.717 --> 12:47.230
I don't know I think I just
need some time to get used to the idea.

12:47.231 --> 12:48.990
No no no, don't think about it.

12:48.991 --> 12:50.736
Parenthood is like sky diving.

12:50.737 --> 12:55.372
- You just gotta jump out of the old plane.
- And get sucked in to the old propeller.

12:55.373 --> 12:56.763
A propeller of Love.

12:57.691 --> 13:01.478
Hey, Listen. Why don't we go out and
talk about this over a couple of beers

13:01.479 --> 13:04.561
Oh, no thanks, I really enjoy spending
time with you fellas, but...

13:04.562 --> 13:08.472
- I don't really drink.
- That's okay. Neither do I.

13:10.076 --> 13:11.176
Well... ok, sure.

13:12.123 --> 13:14.289
- I just tell Judith that I'm leaving.
- That's Ok I'll tell her.

13:14.290 --> 13:16.072
- Judith, we're leaving.
- Good.

13:16.073 --> 13:17.163
Let's go.

13:21.792 --> 13:24.246
First wife and I tried
to have kids but...

13:24.247 --> 13:26.067
...didn't happen.

13:26.070 --> 13:28.483
And when she got sick
and passed away...

13:28.484 --> 13:30.010
I didn't think I'll ever have a family.

13:30.011 --> 13:32.631
- Oh, that's so sad.
- Yeah.

13:33.512 --> 13:35.722
Who was shooting blanks?
You or her?

13:36.020 --> 13:37.770
Cahrlie, that doesn't matter.

13:37.856 --> 13:41.452
What matters is that he's
starting fresh with Judith.

13:41.453 --> 13:45.143
A live woman of proven fertility.

13:46.124 --> 13:49.804
What good does that do
if he's packing a starters pistol?

13:49.805 --> 13:52.240
- I'm fine
- You hear that? He's fine.

13:52.241 --> 13:55.951
Jake can have a little brother. That would
be a blessing from heave, wouldn't it?

13:55.952 --> 14:00.042
- Oh, I don't know if I want more kids.
- Then wear a condom.

14:01.248 --> 14:03.259
Besides Jake is used to being an only child.

14:03.260 --> 14:07.350
If there was anyone he would
probably eat it by mistake.

14:08.405 --> 14:10.977
So Herb, you haven't
touched your beer.

14:10.978 --> 14:13.648
Oh, like I said I'm
not much of a drinker.

14:14.095 --> 14:16.828
Then we need a drinking game.

14:16.829 --> 14:17.809
How about this:

14:17.933 --> 14:22.233
Each time Alan shoots me
a dirty look, we all take a drink.

14:22.353 --> 14:23.683
Oop, here we gooo...

14:29.963 --> 14:32.071
Jou guys are great guys.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.292
I love you guys.

14:33.535 --> 14:36.205
You know why?
'Cause you're great.

14:36.954 --> 14:37.704
You know, Herb,

14:37.842 --> 14:40.751
I wish more women held their
liquor the way you do.

14:40.752 --> 14:41.792
Thanks.

14:46.684 --> 14:48.657
I would like to propose a toast.

14:48.658 --> 14:50.632
- To Jake.
- Ah, Jake's great.

14:50.633 --> 14:53.466
- And to Judith.
- Absolutely. Judith's great too.

14:53.467 --> 14:56.142
And your upcoming marriage.

14:56.143 --> 14:57.703
Ah, sure, what the hell.

15:02.827 --> 15:04.469
You know what I never had?

15:04.470 --> 15:05.870
A second beer?

15:07.776 --> 15:10.816
- No. A bachelor party.
- Me neither.

15:11.026 --> 15:12.476
Thanks to my brother.

15:13.069 --> 15:14.399
Oop, bottoms up!

15:17.582 --> 15:20.616
Hey, why don't we make
this your bachelor party, you know?

15:20.617 --> 15:23.700
One last big blowout with your
friends before you get married.

15:23.701 --> 15:25.263
But my friends aren't here?

15:25.264 --> 15:27.064
What about us?
We're your friends.

15:27.224 --> 15:29.575
We wish you well, right Charlie?

15:29.576 --> 15:30.496
Well.

15:31.912 --> 15:34.017
Oh, come on, what do you say?

15:34.018 --> 15:35.588
I don't know, I mean...

15:36.286 --> 15:40.966
This is a bachelor party...
Wouldn't be a couple of strippers?

15:43.867 --> 15:45.857
- Charle?
- I'm on it.

15:59.179 --> 16:02.259
He's gonna make a
great stepdad for Jake.

16:02.451 --> 16:03.551
Yeah, whatever.

16:04.043 --> 16:07.245
And with the alimony I save I can go out
to eat every night...

16:07.246 --> 16:10.333
...in restaurants. And I'm not
talking early birds special

16:10.334 --> 16:15.184
I can eat when it's dark out
with people my own age.

16:19.644 --> 16:21.729
Hey, did your cellphone have video?

16:21.730 --> 16:22.710
Yeah. Why?

16:24.668 --> 16:25.768
Observe.

16:27.043 --> 16:28.433
What are you doing?

16:28.546 --> 16:31.516
Just in case he decides
to back out of the wedding.

16:31.517 --> 16:33.557
- That's blackmailing.
- So?

16:33.612 --> 16:34.632
I like it.

16:36.727 --> 16:37.757
Hey, Herb.

16:41.068 --> 16:43.458
Attaboy.
You dumb bastard.

16:48.653 --> 16:50.213
No it's Judith.

16:50.997 --> 16:53.413
Why is she calling me at this our?

16:53.414 --> 16:54.454
Hello?

16:55.299 --> 16:58.329
Of course, it's me. Who are you expecting?

17:01.138 --> 17:03.638
Oh, my God.
This is Herb's phone.

17:13.218 --> 17:14.958
Herb is in the bathroom.

17:15.621 --> 17:19.361
Yeah, we're just having a couple of
beers and get to know each other.

17:19.640 --> 17:22.117
Well with all due respect Judith,
before we got married...

17:22.117 --> 17:23.568
...I didn't drink either.

17:25.200 --> 17:28.870
Hey, there's no call
for that kind of language.

17:30.303 --> 17:33.273
What, I'm sorry I can't hear you.

17:34.072 --> 17:37.222
I think this phone is
... unnin... out of... atteries.

17:38.566 --> 17:41.706
I... aid this... one is
... unnin... out of... atteries.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.010
Good bye... udith.

17:47.182 --> 17:48.574
You think she bought it?

17:48.575 --> 17:51.715
If she did, she's... upider than... u.

17:55.498 --> 17:56.898
Excuse me fellas.

17:57.500 --> 17:59.928
Can either of you cash a check for me?

17:59.929 --> 18:02.504
- Why?
- I'd like to tip the ladies.

18:02.505 --> 18:05.031
No, forget the tip, we gotta get you home.

18:05.032 --> 18:10.372
Why would I go home when for an extra
300 bucks I can go all around the world?

18:10.508 --> 18:12.128
He got a point Allan.

18:13.132 --> 18:16.514
Herb, listen to me! Your fiancée
is worried about you.

18:16.515 --> 18:17.325
Oh, right.

18:19.444 --> 18:22.014
Golly, she's gonna be pretty PO-d.

18:23.754 --> 18:25.440
It's OK.
She doesn't need to know.

18:25.441 --> 18:27.658
That's right.
She doesn't need to know.

18:27.659 --> 18:29.459
Can I borrow 300 dollars?

18:31.844 --> 18:33.127
What are you doing?

18:33.128 --> 18:34.858
Call it a wedding gift.

18:34.859 --> 18:36.355
Are you crazy?
I gotta get him home.

18:36.356 --> 18:38.894
- So take him home.
- What are you gonna do?

18:38.895 --> 18:41.275
I'm thinking maybe
I'm going all around the world.

18:41.669 --> 18:46.469
God knows I've racked up
on a frequent flier miles.

18:46.965 --> 18:47.965
Herb?

18:49.964 --> 18:50.964
Herb?

18:52.245 --> 18:53.245
Herb?

18:54.837 --> 18:57.375
Charlie, you gonna have
to help me take him home.

18:57.376 --> 18:58.456
Charlie?

19:06.563 --> 19:08.759
- You have a key?
- No, I don't have a key.

19:08.760 --> 19:11.451
- Maybe he's got a key.
- You wanna go through his pockets?

19:11.452 --> 19:12.732
Not particularly.

19:13.088 --> 19:15.788
Maybe we'd just leave him on
the porch ring the bell and run.

19:15.789 --> 19:19.184
He's not a bag of
flaming dog poo.

19:19.185 --> 19:22.215
No, that was Judith
first husband.

19:22.931 --> 19:25.681
Oop, dirty look, where's my beer?

19:26.974 --> 19:30.414
Allright, I'll go
through his pockets.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.059
Ah, Judith.

19:36.404 --> 19:38.744
What the hell is going on?

19:47.944 --> 19:49.334
That was close.

19:49.662 --> 19:51.342
No, it wasn't close.

19:51.805 --> 19:54.794
Close is when you get away with it
that was nowhere near close.

19:54.795 --> 19:56.406
Allright allright.
It doesn't matter.

19:56.827 --> 20:00.867
He had a good time, he's gonna marry Judith
and I'm off the hook for alimony.

20:00.868 --> 20:01.968
That's true.

20:05.248 --> 20:06.528
- Hey, Alan?
- Yeah?

20:07.770 --> 20:10.510
You did erase the video
from the cellphone, right?

20:11.486 --> 20:14.147
Oh boy. It would be
really stupid if I didn't.

20:14.148 --> 20:14.958
Yes, It would.

20:20.445 --> 20:23.475
<i>Hey Herb! Attaboy.
You dumb bastard.</i>

20:28.947 --> 20:30.647
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

20:31.069 --> 20:32.149
And you.

20:33.785 --> 20:36.335
Ok, this is one root beer...

20:39.259 --> 20:41.299
...and one orange soda.
