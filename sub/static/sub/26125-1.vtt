'Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Vanity Fair.'

01:08.768 --> 01:09.768
'Please remember,

01:09.769 --> 01:14.287
'Vanity Fair is a very vain,
wicked, foolish place,

01:14.288 --> 01:17.767
'full of all sorts of humbug,
falseness and pretension.

01:17.768 --> 01:20.767
'Not a moral place, certainly,
nor a merry one,

01:20.768 --> 01:22.767
'though very noisy.

01:22.768 --> 01:27.768
'A world where everyone is striving
for what is not worth having.'

01:43.768 --> 01:48.768
Wooo!

02:23.947 --> 02:25.586
You forget your station, Miss Sharp.

02:25.587 --> 02:28.587
I do, yes, daily and most sincerely.

02:32.587 --> 02:34.586
I took you in when you had nothing.

02:34.587 --> 02:36.586
And got a very good bargain
for your trouble.

02:36.587 --> 02:37.946
It's simple, Miss Pinkerton.

02:37.947 --> 02:40.586
If you want me to teach the girls
music as well as French,

02:40.587 --> 02:42.586
you'll have to pay me proper money,

02:42.587 --> 02:44.586
or find me a situation elsewhere.

02:44.587 --> 02:47.266
Lord knows that's what we both want
most in the world.

02:47.267 --> 02:48.786
Becky...

02:48.787 --> 02:51.586
if you think that
because you are clever,

02:51.587 --> 02:53.586
society will overlook
your low birth...

02:53.587 --> 02:54.587
I do, yes. Why not?

02:54.587 --> 02:55.587
...then I fear the real world

02:55.588 --> 02:57.706
will come as a dreadful shock
to you.

03:02.267 --> 03:03.586
I'm the only person under your roof

03:03.587 --> 03:06.705
who has the first idea
what the real world looks like.

03:10.587 --> 03:11.946
I wanted a purebred Arab,

03:11.947 --> 03:13.586
but Papa can be so unreasonable.

03:13.587 --> 03:17.586
My other pony is a palomino.
So jealous!

03:17.587 --> 03:19.586
I shall write to you
every single day.

03:19.587 --> 03:22.106
Be sure I will never forget you.

03:22.107 --> 03:26.586
Hush, girls, hush. It's the last day
of school, not the end of the world.

03:26.587 --> 03:27.587
Girls! Please!

03:27.588 --> 03:30.586
For those of you leaving us today,
a little memento

03:30.587 --> 03:33.586
of what my sister and I hope
have been happy years -

03:33.587 --> 03:35.587
a lovely dictionary.

03:36.587 --> 03:39.586
With a more ladylike attitude,
you could have had a future here.

03:39.587 --> 03:42.587
I'd rather beg in the streets.

03:45.787 --> 03:47.587
Yes, I see it now.

03:48.627 --> 03:50.586
Only innocent foolishness

03:50.587 --> 03:52.586
could have led me to think
I could ever make something

03:52.587 --> 03:56.586
of the daughter of an artist
and an opera girl.

03:56.587 --> 04:01.266
Miss Sharp, you shall make your way
to Hampshire,

04:01.267 --> 04:04.091
there to take up your new situation
as governess.

04:04.587 --> 04:06.587
All the details are here.

04:09.587 --> 04:11.107
Governess?!

04:12.267 --> 04:13.586
Ungrateful wretch!

04:13.587 --> 04:15.586
I am worth more than Hampshire!

04:15.587 --> 04:18.586
We shall see if Sir Pitt Crawley MP
shares your opinion.

04:18.587 --> 04:20.586
You start one week today.

04:20.587 --> 04:21.587
An orderly queue, girls.

04:21.588 --> 04:24.587
Where am I to go till then?
No longer my concern.

04:25.587 --> 04:26.626
You see?

04:26.627 --> 04:30.586
How a Christian
may seek to do good, girls,

04:30.587 --> 04:32.586
only to find she has nursed a viper

04:32.587 --> 04:34.107
in her bosom.

04:39.587 --> 04:41.587
Gosh.

04:48.587 --> 04:52.586
You might tell your parents
the headmistress they pay so well

04:52.587 --> 04:54.587
can't speak a word of French.

04:59.587 --> 05:00.587
Free at last.

05:15.947 --> 05:17.107
Leave it there.

05:23.107 --> 05:25.587
Damn and blast.

05:27.587 --> 05:30.587
I'm sure she didn't mean it,
Miss Sharp.

05:37.587 --> 05:40.587
No! Becky, please don't cry.

05:41.587 --> 05:44.586
No, Amelia, take no notice.

05:44.587 --> 05:45.587
It's nothing.

05:54.587 --> 05:56.587
Room for a little one?

05:57.787 --> 05:59.586
Is that it, miss?

05:59.587 --> 06:01.586
I travel light.

06:01.587 --> 06:02.587
For now.

06:04.107 --> 06:06.106
This is going to be such fun!

06:06.107 --> 06:07.266
Amelia!

06:07.267 --> 06:09.586
Amelia, what are you doing?

06:09.587 --> 06:12.586
Well, poor Becky's got no-one,
so she's coming home with me.

06:12.587 --> 06:14.586
Miss Sharp has a situation.

06:14.587 --> 06:17.587
Miss Sharp is going to Hampshire.

06:22.107 --> 06:25.586
Poor dear girl
didn't get the best start in life.

06:25.587 --> 06:27.470
Don't make excuses for the minx.

06:32.587 --> 06:36.586
You gave that... serpent
one of my precious dictionaries.

06:36.587 --> 06:38.427
It was only two and ninepence.

06:40.587 --> 06:43.626
Vive la France!

06:43.627 --> 06:46.587
Vive Napoleon!

06:51.587 --> 06:54.586
I hate the whole place, Amelia.

06:54.587 --> 06:56.586
I hope I never set eyes
on that black hole again.

06:56.587 --> 06:58.586
I wish it were
in the bottom of the Thames.

06:58.587 --> 07:02.586
I never knew you capable of
such wicked, vengeful thoughts.

07:02.587 --> 07:04.947
You are altogether
too good to be true.

07:13.587 --> 07:15.586
So that was school.

07:15.587 --> 07:17.587
And this is the world.

07:43.587 --> 07:44.587
Candles, miss?

07:54.947 --> 07:57.267
For King and country!

07:59.107 --> 08:01.266
Our great city.

08:01.267 --> 08:03.586
What are your hopes of it, Amelia?

08:03.587 --> 08:05.586
I'm just like any other girl.

08:05.587 --> 08:09.586
I want to be married and happy.

08:09.587 --> 08:11.587
What about you?

08:12.587 --> 08:15.587
I want to make sure
tomorrow is better than today.

08:17.587 --> 08:18.587
Every day.

08:40.587 --> 08:41.587
A-ha!

08:41.587 --> 08:42.587
Thank you.

08:42.587 --> 08:43.785
Mama!

08:43.787 --> 08:45.946
Girl!

08:45.947 --> 08:48.586
You'll squeeze her to death,
you ninny.

08:48.587 --> 08:49.786
Papa!

08:49.787 --> 08:51.587
My darling, welcome home.

08:54.427 --> 08:56.586
You've heard me speak about Becky.

08:56.587 --> 08:58.587
Endlessly, yes, yes.

08:59.587 --> 09:01.587
She's come to stay.

09:03.587 --> 09:06.586
It's only for a week.
She's nowhere else to go.

09:06.587 --> 09:08.586
What a lovely surprise!

09:08.587 --> 09:09.587
Welcome. Come!

09:11.427 --> 09:12.586
I'll take this.

09:12.587 --> 09:14.107
Come on through.

09:15.587 --> 09:17.586
All the girls adored her.

09:17.587 --> 09:19.626
And we thought her so exotic, Mama,

09:19.627 --> 09:23.586
with her wild hair
and singing her little songs.

09:23.587 --> 09:26.586
Little orphan. All alone.

09:26.587 --> 09:27.587
Aw.

09:27.588 --> 09:31.586
Silly thing
would cry over a dead canary!

09:31.587 --> 09:32.786
Thank you.

09:32.787 --> 09:35.586
So, as to your father, Miss Sharp.

09:35.587 --> 09:38.586
He taught the girls
drawing and painting

09:38.587 --> 09:39.882
while still in health.

09:40.587 --> 09:42.786
Alas, our Lord saw fit
to reunite him in Heaven

09:42.787 --> 09:44.587
with my beloved mama.

09:46.587 --> 09:49.266
He was a man of great talent
and virtue,

09:49.267 --> 09:52.106
and he died in my arms
with a prayer on his lips.

09:52.107 --> 09:54.586
Poor darling.

09:54.587 --> 09:55.786
I was so very fortunate

09:55.787 --> 09:58.586
that dear Miss Pinkerton
allowed me to remain at the school

09:58.587 --> 10:00.586
and gave me the opportunity
of helping to teach.

10:00.587 --> 10:02.627
Miss Pinkerton is a saint.

10:15.587 --> 10:17.586
'They love you.'

10:17.587 --> 10:19.586
I knew they would.

10:19.587 --> 10:21.586
Amelia.

10:21.587 --> 10:25.586
What I'd give to have parents
who are so kind and fond

10:25.587 --> 10:26.587
and... rich.

10:26.588 --> 10:29.586
They're not rich. Not really.

10:29.587 --> 10:30.587
Papa's only a stockbroker.

10:30.587 --> 10:31.587
I'm sure he's a very good one,

10:31.588 --> 10:34.587
but it's Jos
who has the money to burn.

10:39.587 --> 10:41.587
It's yours..

10:42.587 --> 10:43.587
He won't mind.

10:43.588 --> 10:45.586
He brought me two more
when he came home from India.

10:45.587 --> 10:47.586
My brother, Jos.

10:47.587 --> 10:50.587
He's the Collector
of Boggley Wollah, it's in India.

10:51.587 --> 10:53.586
What does he collect there?

10:53.587 --> 10:55.587
Do you know, I've no idea!

10:57.587 --> 10:59.586
India sounds so...

10:59.587 --> 11:01.586
Far away.
..so exciting.

11:01.587 --> 11:02.587
We're about the same size.

11:02.588 --> 11:04.587
Let's see.

11:07.587 --> 11:08.587
Perfect colour.

11:08.588 --> 11:10.587
For your complexion.

11:14.587 --> 11:15.646
Wear it at dinner.

11:18.587 --> 11:20.586
I can't believe you never told me
you've got a brother

11:20.587 --> 11:23.587
who's an Indian nabob.

11:24.947 --> 11:26.626
Is your sister-in-law nice?

11:26.627 --> 11:28.586
Jos, married?

11:28.587 --> 11:30.586
Lord above, no!

11:30.587 --> 11:32.586
No. My poor brother. He's...

11:32.587 --> 11:35.587
He's terrified of young ladies.

11:36.587 --> 11:40.587
Well, I shan't let the poor soul
be terrified of me.

11:43.587 --> 11:45.587
He's early!

11:47.587 --> 11:48.587
How do I look?

11:48.587 --> 11:49.587
My hair.

11:49.588 --> 11:51.586
Perhaps a necklace.

11:51.587 --> 11:54.587
Maybe the cornelians.
Becky, I feel I may faint!

11:57.787 --> 12:00.587
The young lady
will be pleased to see you, sir.

12:08.587 --> 12:10.626
I thought I would die
when I didn't get a letter from you

12:10.627 --> 12:12.586
for two whole weeks!

12:12.587 --> 12:14.586
Silly miss! But I'm here now.

12:14.587 --> 12:16.999
As I promised.
Although I can't stay long.

12:17.587 --> 12:18.626
Hello.

12:18.627 --> 12:20.586
I think, Amelia,

12:20.587 --> 12:23.266
this gentleman
is perhaps not your brother.

12:23.267 --> 12:25.586
No! This is George, of course.

12:25.587 --> 12:26.587
Miss Rebecca Sharp,

12:26.588 --> 12:28.586
my best friend from school.

12:28.587 --> 12:32.586
Mr George Osborne,
my best friend from... forever.

12:32.587 --> 12:34.586
Heard a good deal about you,
Mr Osborne.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.267
The French mistress?

12:37.587 --> 12:39.586
My family fell upon hard times.

12:39.587 --> 12:41.587
But my mother was a Montmorency.

12:42.947 --> 12:44.586
She's only here for a week.

12:44.587 --> 12:48.586
And I so long for the two of you
to love each other.

12:48.587 --> 12:50.586
And we will. Miss Sharp.

12:50.587 --> 12:51.787
Mr Osborne.

12:52.947 --> 12:54.106
Mr Jos.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.267
Sir.
Osborne.

12:57.587 --> 12:58.587
Emmy!

13:02.587 --> 13:03.946
Jos!

13:03.947 --> 13:06.586
He is impossible. Jos!

13:06.587 --> 13:08.267
Jos!

13:10.093 --> 13:12.093
A challenge for you, Miss Sharp?

13:24.586 --> 13:27.106
Yes, we've lived here all our lives.

13:27.445 --> 13:28.604
Ooh!

13:28.624 --> 13:31.585
So your papa, the stockbroker,
in this house. Yes.

13:31.586 --> 13:33.585
And his papa, the banker,
in that one.

13:33.586 --> 13:35.763
George, yes. And his papa,
Mr Osborne.

13:36.946 --> 13:39.425
Neighbours and best friends.

13:39.426 --> 13:41.585
But an arranged marriage
is so old-fashioned.

13:41.586 --> 13:43.585
What about
falling in love and so on?

13:43.586 --> 13:45.585
We are in love, silly!

13:45.586 --> 13:49.585
Ever since we were little children.

13:49.586 --> 13:52.585
I'd love my George
if his father were a chimney sweep.

13:52.586 --> 13:56.586
It's love that matters, isn't it?
So much more than money.

13:57.586 --> 13:59.585
Depends how much you start out with.

13:59.586 --> 14:01.585
You don't mean that!

14:01.586 --> 14:03.105
When you find the right man...

14:03.106 --> 14:06.586
He'll have lots of money,
or he won't be the right man.

14:10.586 --> 14:13.265
I hope our British curry
is hot enough for you, Jos.

14:13.266 --> 14:15.585
Mother, it's twice as good
as any of my curries in India.

14:15.586 --> 14:17.645
I made it just the way you like it.

14:19.586 --> 14:20.625
Monkey curry, snake curry.

14:20.626 --> 14:22.585
That's all they ever eat
in Boggley Wollah,

14:22.586 --> 14:23.586
isn't that right, Jos?

14:23.587 --> 14:24.882
Don't torment the boy.

14:25.586 --> 14:27.585
May I try some?

14:27.586 --> 14:29.425
No, Becky. You won't like it.

14:29.426 --> 14:31.585
Mayn't I, Mr Jos?

14:31.586 --> 14:34.625
I so want to learn
about Indian dishes.

14:34.626 --> 14:38.585
Careful, Miss Sharp. The collector
is accustomed to a lot of chilli.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.586
Chilli sounds so cool and lovely.

14:44.586 --> 14:46.626
Mr Sedley...
Nothing to do with me.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.585
May I have a little glass of water?

15:28.586 --> 15:29.586
Please.

15:29.586 --> 15:30.586
Gad.

15:36.586 --> 15:37.586
'When have you known him'

15:37.587 --> 15:41.586
to be remotely interested
in young ladies until now?

15:42.586 --> 15:45.585
Most fond mothers would find that
a welcome development

15:45.586 --> 15:46.586
in a son of 30.

15:47.626 --> 15:52.586
An artist's daughter.
It's... demeaning.

15:53.586 --> 15:56.585
Name me the young lady
of good breeding

15:56.586 --> 16:00.585
who will want to accompany
that great lardy loafer to India.

16:00.586 --> 16:03.585
My son is not lardy.

16:03.586 --> 16:05.106
He's as vain as a girl.

16:06.586 --> 16:08.585
He's a great deal vainer
than you ever were

16:08.586 --> 16:10.585
in your whole life,
and that's saying something.

16:10.586 --> 16:12.585
I beg your pardon.

16:12.586 --> 16:14.586
Thank you, Sam.
Thank you.

16:17.626 --> 16:21.785
Louisa, if the first girl
to fish for him hooks him,

16:21.786 --> 16:23.585
good luck to her.

16:23.586 --> 16:25.585
I don't care who he marries.

16:25.586 --> 16:29.585
This little friend Amelia's
is a white face, at any rate.

16:29.586 --> 16:32.585
Better than
sending him back to India,

16:32.586 --> 16:34.585
into the arms of
some dusky maharani.

16:34.586 --> 16:36.425
Ooh!

16:36.426 --> 16:38.897
Better than
a dozen mahogany grandchildren!

16:41.786 --> 16:42.946
Well...

16:43.786 --> 16:46.586
...how far can she get
in a week?

18:02.586 --> 18:04.585
Mr Jos.

18:04.586 --> 18:07.585
Hay fever. So help me, Sam,
I'm a martyr to it.

18:07.586 --> 18:08.586
No, no.

18:10.266 --> 18:11.585
Jos!

18:11.586 --> 18:13.585
For Amelia.
Ooh.

18:13.586 --> 18:14.586
For Miss Sharp.

18:17.106 --> 18:18.754
No, no. The other way round.

18:21.586 --> 18:23.266
You are kind...

18:25.586 --> 18:26.586
Just...

18:28.426 --> 18:29.585
You are kind at heart, sir,

18:29.586 --> 18:31.586
like all your loving family.

18:33.586 --> 18:35.625
We'll take these.

18:35.626 --> 18:37.585
I'll find a vase.

18:37.586 --> 18:38.645
Won't be a moment.

18:50.106 --> 18:52.105
You must have
so many fascinating tales

18:52.106 --> 18:53.585
from your life in India,

18:53.586 --> 18:55.586
Mr Joseph.

18:58.586 --> 19:01.585
And another time,
this enormous wedding elephant

19:01.586 --> 19:05.265
just ran amok through the village,
with a great big parasol

19:05.266 --> 19:08.585
waving violently above its head,
and tusks just everywhere.

19:08.586 --> 19:10.945
And all its fingers and toes
painted.

19:10.946 --> 19:12.586
Fingers?
Toes!

19:13.586 --> 19:16.425
They have a lot of toes,
do elephants.

19:16.426 --> 19:18.585
And tusks, of course. Scary tusks.

19:18.586 --> 19:20.585
I'm sure YOU were not scared.

19:20.586 --> 19:22.585
Indeed I was not.

19:22.586 --> 19:23.645
I think I might...

19:24.586 --> 19:27.945
Well, in fact, I did. Yes, I did...
I...

19:27.946 --> 19:30.585
I ran out into its path,

19:30.586 --> 19:31.586
and I seized it by the bridle...

19:31.587 --> 19:35.585
And prevented the deaths
of so many innocent natives.

19:35.586 --> 19:36.586
Indeed.

19:38.586 --> 19:39.946
Indeed I did.

19:41.106 --> 19:42.786
Definitely.

19:46.586 --> 19:49.585
Are there many ladies in...
in Boggley Wollah?

19:49.586 --> 19:50.586
Ladies? Lordy, no.

19:50.587 --> 19:54.585
It's a lonely, marshy,
jungly sort of place.

19:54.586 --> 19:56.585
I scarcely see a Christian face.

19:56.586 --> 19:58.585
I shouldn't mind that for a minute.

19:58.586 --> 20:01.175
Not if there were elephants
and tigers and...

20:02.586 --> 20:04.586
...brave gentlemen.

20:14.106 --> 20:15.585
Miss Sharp.

20:15.586 --> 20:17.585
Becky.

20:17.586 --> 20:19.585
Could you ever think...

20:19.586 --> 20:20.586
I mean...

20:22.586 --> 20:23.763
Could I ever hope...

20:26.586 --> 20:27.946
Ooh, tiffin!

20:33.586 --> 20:34.822
Excellent, thank you.

20:38.586 --> 20:39.586
It's delicious.

21:04.991 --> 21:06.350
Yes?

21:06.351 --> 21:07.990
No.

21:07.991 --> 21:10.190
Even though I was
very quiet and ladylike,

21:10.191 --> 21:12.990
and enormously interested in India.

21:12.991 --> 21:14.350
Tomorrow. I know it.

21:14.351 --> 21:15.990
Tomorrow or the next day

21:15.991 --> 21:17.671
he will declare himself.

21:20.991 --> 21:23.168
I know nothing
of Sir Pitt Crawley MP.

21:24.991 --> 21:26.350
I cannot bear to be a governess.

21:26.351 --> 21:30.057
I wasn't put on this earth to be
a poor and friendless spinster.

21:31.991 --> 21:32.991
I have only three days

21:32.992 --> 21:35.404
before I must leave
for darkest Hampshire.

21:35.991 --> 21:37.990
You're not going. You're not.

21:37.991 --> 21:38.991
It's too unfair

21:38.992 --> 21:43.191
that you should be unhappy
when I am so blessed.

21:53.991 --> 21:55.670
What are you doing?

21:55.671 --> 21:58.991
Reminding George of a promise.

22:00.991 --> 22:01.991
Well, I don't like her.

22:01.992 --> 22:03.030
She's a nice, gay,

22:03.031 --> 22:04.990
and merry young creature.

22:04.991 --> 22:07.990
In fact, she's devilish
like that fine girl at Dumdum

22:07.991 --> 22:09.990
that made a dead set at me.

22:09.991 --> 22:11.990
Um... Miss Cutler as was.

22:11.991 --> 22:12.991
That was 10 years ago.

22:12.992 --> 22:15.030
Didn't Miss Cutler
marry the surgeon?

22:15.031 --> 22:17.990
I have a most killing flair
with the ladies, George.

22:17.991 --> 22:20.990
It would be unfair of you
to suggest otherwise.

22:20.991 --> 22:22.990
The ladies,
they'll need a chaperone.

22:22.991 --> 22:25.990
Gad. Jos, you're the one
in need of a chaperone.

22:25.991 --> 22:28.990
At least until the departure
of a certain young person

22:28.991 --> 22:30.830
with fire in her eyes.

22:30.831 --> 22:31.990
Pooh. Nonsense.

22:31.991 --> 22:32.991
Just the man.

22:32.992 --> 22:34.990
The virtue of the Queen of Sheba
would be safe with him.

22:34.991 --> 22:36.990
Dobbin of ours. I say, Dobbin.

22:36.991 --> 22:40.030
Madness, but apparently,
I promised Mr Sedley's sister

22:40.031 --> 22:42.990
I would take her to Vauxhall.
Vauxhall?

22:42.991 --> 22:45.030
Will you join us
for a night's pleasuring?

22:45.031 --> 22:47.990
Not entirely my cup of tea.

22:47.991 --> 22:49.990
Go on, Dob.
You're going to be my best man.

22:49.991 --> 22:52.990
You ought to at least... see her.

22:52.991 --> 22:54.991
Well, I have met her, haven't I?

22:56.191 --> 22:57.670
Years ago.

22:57.671 --> 22:59.990
Your tenth birthday party.
You must remember, Emmy.

22:59.991 --> 23:02.030
Dobbin poured
an entire bowl of punch

23:02.031 --> 23:04.990
down your mother's
green satin dress.

23:04.991 --> 23:07.050
Long forgiven, dear Captain Dobbin.

23:08.671 --> 23:10.670
Alas, I...
Y-You were so young

23:10.671 --> 23:12.670
and tiny, Miss Sedley.

23:12.671 --> 23:16.511
I was big and awkward. Still.

23:17.991 --> 23:18.991
Dobbin.

23:19.991 --> 23:21.510
Dobbin!

23:21.511 --> 23:22.990
The one you were at school with,
George.

23:22.991 --> 23:24.990
The one who beat off
that horrid bully

23:24.991 --> 23:26.990
when you were just a little boy.

23:26.991 --> 23:29.830
I just... took the other chap
by surprise, being much taller.

23:29.831 --> 23:33.990
Old Dob dropped that villain
like a billiard ball into a pocket.

23:33.991 --> 23:35.991
Hail Dobbin, the conquering hero.

23:39.671 --> 23:42.031
You'll always be my hero,
Captain Dobbin.

23:53.991 --> 23:54.991
My dears.

23:55.991 --> 24:00.990
He's been priming himself.
Damned fool.

24:00.997 --> 24:04.762
The Collector of Boggley Wollah
is pleased to offer his arm to...

24:04.991 --> 24:06.990
...Miss Sharp,

24:06.991 --> 24:09.990
for this evening's foray

24:09.991 --> 24:11.991
to Vauxhall pleasure gardens.

24:43.258 --> 24:44.258
Welcome, Miss Sharp,

24:44.259 --> 24:47.257
to the earthly paradise
that is Vauxhall Gardens.

24:47.258 --> 24:51.258
I intend to take it by storm, sir.
And you shall.

24:53.938 --> 24:57.257
It's the emperor of India himself.

24:57.258 --> 24:59.937
Watch he don't squash you, miss!

24:59.938 --> 25:03.257
Do not be alarmed by the riff-raff,
Miss Sharp,

25:03.258 --> 25:04.258
for I shall protect you.

25:04.259 --> 25:06.257
I know it, sir.

25:06.258 --> 25:09.257
The music's started already.

25:09.258 --> 25:11.729
Dob, take the shawls and things,
would you?

25:12.258 --> 25:14.257
Thank you.

25:14.258 --> 25:16.494
And get the tickets.
I'll pay you back.

25:28.258 --> 25:29.258
Woo!

25:29.259 --> 25:31.258
Careful, Miss Sharp.

25:37.938 --> 25:40.938
I love this place!
Absolutely thrilling, Miss Sharp.

25:42.258 --> 25:43.778
Woo!

25:51.258 --> 25:53.257
Get your drinks here.
Yes, my man.

25:53.258 --> 25:54.258
Stout?!

25:54.258 --> 25:55.258
Don't you have claret, man?

25:55.259 --> 25:58.257
They always had claret here
in the old days,

25:58.258 --> 26:00.257
but now they let in
any old Tom, Dick and Harry.

26:00.258 --> 26:02.617
Mr Jos,
it's the whole point of this place,

26:02.618 --> 26:04.257
as my dear papa used to say,

26:04.258 --> 26:05.258
in happier times.

26:07.258 --> 26:08.258
Ooh!

26:10.258 --> 26:12.457
The air is sweet, though, isn't it?

26:12.458 --> 26:14.257
Isn't it, Miss Sharp?

26:14.258 --> 26:17.258
Violets and roses and...

26:18.258 --> 26:21.257
What's that, I can't quite...
I can't quite make it out.

26:21.258 --> 26:22.258
Ooh!

26:24.258 --> 26:27.257
Thrilling, isn't it?
Thrilling.

26:27.258 --> 26:28.258
Gad.

26:28.259 --> 26:30.257
Ladies and gentlemen,

26:30.258 --> 26:33.257
pray raise your eyes to the heaven,

26:33.258 --> 26:37.097
and there feast them
on the beautiful,

26:37.098 --> 26:39.257
the extraordinary,

26:39.258 --> 26:42.257
the ineffable courage and artistry

26:42.258 --> 26:45.257
that is, all the way from Paris,

26:45.258 --> 26:47.257
Madame Saqui!

26:47.258 --> 26:48.258
Ooh la la!

26:50.258 --> 26:51.617
I wish we could have come alone,

26:51.618 --> 26:52.777
just the two of us.

26:52.778 --> 26:54.777
Well, that would miss
the whole point.

26:54.778 --> 26:57.257
I thought the point was
to gaze into my brown eyes

26:57.258 --> 27:00.097
while the sun sets romantically
in the west.

27:00.098 --> 27:02.258
Look, I'm gazing, I'm gazing.

27:06.258 --> 27:07.258
Thank you.

27:07.259 --> 27:11.257
Mr Jos! Promise to protect me!

27:11.258 --> 27:12.258
Take my hand, Miss Sharp,

27:12.259 --> 27:14.257
and we shall ascend into the heavens
together.

27:14.258 --> 27:16.257
Bring up the rear, Osborne,
would you?

27:16.258 --> 27:17.258
There's a good fella.

27:17.259 --> 27:19.257
You're not nervous, are you, Sedley?

27:19.258 --> 27:21.258
Me? No. The idea!

27:24.778 --> 27:25.937
Hold on tight now,

27:25.938 --> 27:27.097
ladies and gentlemen.

27:27.098 --> 27:29.257
Hold on tight. And up we go!

27:29.258 --> 27:30.258
Ooh! Ooh!

27:43.258 --> 27:45.777
Higher!

27:45.778 --> 27:46.937
It's too high already!

27:46.938 --> 27:48.527
Never too high, not for me.

27:55.258 --> 27:57.258
I'm on top of the world.

27:58.258 --> 28:00.258
George.

28:01.258 --> 28:04.435
I don't think I'll ever be happier
than in this moment.

28:06.098 --> 28:08.258
I very much hope that's not true.

28:35.938 --> 28:37.097
Ooh.

28:37.098 --> 28:39.257
They've just
come out of nowhere.

28:39.258 --> 28:41.257
Are you sure you're not frightened?

28:41.258 --> 28:42.617
I'm with you, Jos.

28:42.618 --> 28:45.257
There may be footpads
and mountebanks.

28:45.258 --> 28:46.376
And you're with me.

28:47.258 --> 28:49.257
He's still here!

28:49.258 --> 28:52.257
One shilling and sixpence, miss.

28:52.258 --> 28:53.258
One and six?!

28:54.258 --> 28:58.258
Vanity of vanities.

28:59.258 --> 29:04.257
Tell me, hermit.
Shall we two be happy?

29:04.258 --> 29:08.257
I can send you
a tall, dark, handsome stranger,

29:08.258 --> 29:10.257
but...

29:10.258 --> 29:12.778
you'll only break his heart.

29:14.258 --> 29:16.257
I don't really like this fortune.

29:16.258 --> 29:17.258
Tell me another.

29:18.258 --> 29:20.457
Give us another one and six, then.

29:20.458 --> 29:22.257
Or bugger off, smartish.

29:22.258 --> 29:25.258
I'm not sure this fella
really is a Hindu, Becky.

29:29.778 --> 29:31.258
Tiffin.

29:32.258 --> 29:33.553
Off we go, Miss Sharp.

29:37.258 --> 29:40.435
I don't know about you, Miss Sharp,
but I need a drink.

29:51.258 --> 29:53.257
No, no, leave this to me.

29:53.258 --> 29:55.258
Ooh. For the ladies.

29:57.258 --> 29:58.258
Sir, may I help?

29:58.259 --> 30:02.257
Be off with you.
I can carve better than any native.

30:02.258 --> 30:04.257
Yes, yes.

30:04.258 --> 30:05.258
I'll take that.

30:06.258 --> 30:08.777
Beware, I'm very terrible
when I'm roused.

30:08.778 --> 30:11.257
Jos, for heaven's sake,
let the poor fellow do his job.

30:11.258 --> 30:13.777
Shush.
If there's nothing else, sir.

30:13.778 --> 30:15.297
Rack punch! Bring rack punch.

30:15.298 --> 30:17.257
Everyone drinks rack punch
at Vauxhall.

30:17.258 --> 30:19.097
No, Jos, please don't.

30:19.098 --> 30:22.257
The ladies won't drink it, I don't
like it, and you'll... regret it.

30:22.258 --> 30:24.098
But it's tradition!

30:25.098 --> 30:27.257
And besides, I need something

30:27.258 --> 30:29.729
to calm my nerves tonight,
George, old boy.

30:32.258 --> 30:34.258
Well, you're on your own, man.

30:36.458 --> 30:37.617
And we'd serve...

30:37.618 --> 30:40.257
What a perfect night

30:40.258 --> 30:42.258
for...

30:43.258 --> 30:45.258
So, Miss Sharp.

30:47.778 --> 30:50.258
Miss Sharp!

31:02.098 --> 31:03.258
Bring another!

31:39.258 --> 31:42.257
Thank you, thank you,
you're too kind.

31:42.258 --> 31:45.257
Sing us another one, do!

31:45.258 --> 31:47.257
Angcore, bravo, fat boy!

31:47.258 --> 31:48.937
If it will give the ladies pleasure.

31:48.938 --> 31:52.257
Go on, darlin'! Ain't you gonna
join in with your big beau?

31:52.258 --> 31:53.258
Please take us home.

31:53.259 --> 31:56.097
For heaven's sake, Jos,
you've had enough. Ladies.

31:56.098 --> 31:58.777
No, no. No, no, no, no, no.

31:58.778 --> 32:01.257
My dearest soul,
my diddle-diddle-darling.

32:01.258 --> 32:03.788
Jos. No, Jos. Jos, Jos, Jos.
No, no, no, no.

32:06.258 --> 32:07.258
Go, do something. Go!

32:07.259 --> 32:08.297
Jos, that's enough.

32:08.298 --> 32:10.257
Dance with me, George.

32:10.258 --> 32:11.611
Stop it. That's enough.

32:16.458 --> 32:18.257
Stop that.

32:18.258 --> 32:19.258
That's enough.

32:19.259 --> 32:21.937
My soul's delight.

32:21.938 --> 32:23.257
My own one.

32:23.258 --> 32:27.257
Miss Sharp, would you do me
the great honour and pleasure...

32:27.258 --> 32:29.258
Back off, you scoundrel!

32:32.258 --> 32:35.257
Becky, everything has gone wrong!
Whose fault is that?

32:35.258 --> 32:36.258
Jos, Jos, darling. Say it to me.

32:36.259 --> 32:38.257
Say it to me.
Back away, Miss Sharp!

32:38.258 --> 32:39.617
George! That is uncalled for.

32:39.618 --> 32:41.257
That's right.

32:41.258 --> 32:43.257
Insult me now
when there's no-one to defend me,

32:43.258 --> 32:44.258
but just you wait.

32:44.259 --> 32:46.257
Knock him down, the swine.
Go on, darlin'!

32:46.258 --> 32:48.617
Cheeky bastard!
Who's he think he is?

32:48.618 --> 32:51.257
Stop it! Be off, madam.
All of you, stop it.

32:51.258 --> 32:55.257
George, take the ladies
back to the carriage, now.

32:55.258 --> 32:56.258
The show's over.

32:56.259 --> 32:58.257
Come on, Becky.

32:58.258 --> 32:59.617
Jos, we'll speak tomorrow.

32:59.618 --> 33:01.297
Listen to me! We'll speak tomorrow!

33:01.298 --> 33:04.257
Show's over.
Come on.

33:04.258 --> 33:06.257
My hat.

33:06.258 --> 33:08.098
I can't feel my hat.

33:13.258 --> 33:14.258
Come on.

33:14.259 --> 33:17.097
Come on. I adore her, Dobbin.
I know.

33:17.098 --> 33:19.257
Dob-dob, I will marry her tomorrow.
No, no.

33:19.258 --> 33:22.257
And you shall be witness,
and we'll live haffily ever after.

33:22.258 --> 33:23.258
Good night, emperor!
Good night!

33:23.259 --> 33:25.257
You'll do nothing of the sort
and neither will I.

33:25.258 --> 33:27.257
You know... You know
what the problem is,

33:27.258 --> 33:29.257
with you is?

33:29.258 --> 33:31.258
You've never been in love.

33:33.258 --> 33:35.257
I can't send you home to Amelia
in this state.

33:35.258 --> 33:36.937
Becky!
Come on.

33:36.938 --> 33:38.937
Becky! Becky...

33:38.938 --> 33:41.258
Horse Guards Parade.
Sorry, Becky.

33:42.258 --> 33:43.258
Brr.

33:45.258 --> 33:46.258
BURPS

33:46.258 --> 33:47.258
Bloody fool.

33:48.258 --> 33:50.258
Pull over, Dobbin. Pull over.

33:52.258 --> 33:56.097
I'm sorry
George forgot his manners tonight.

33:56.098 --> 33:58.257
It's not like him. Really, it isn't.

33:58.258 --> 34:01.257
It's no surprise if he wishes
your brother to marry better.

34:01.258 --> 34:03.257
Who is better than my friend?

34:03.258 --> 34:06.258
All the women in England, it seems.

34:08.257 --> 34:11.458
But who can blame George
for wanting the best for you?

34:12.458 --> 34:15.458
You're being too kind, as always.

34:17.257 --> 34:20.257
If there's to be any kindness in me,
I shall learn it here.

34:20.257 --> 34:23.257
I do long to join your family,
Amelia.

34:23.257 --> 34:27.257
So kind and warm and welcoming

34:27.257 --> 34:29.257
to a poor orphan.

34:31.257 --> 34:32.728
Can you love Jos, though?

34:33.257 --> 34:35.257
As a husband?

34:35.257 --> 34:36.257
In spite of the...

34:36.259 --> 34:38.777
the rack punch and the singing.

34:41.257 --> 34:43.257
I feel sure of it.

34:43.257 --> 34:45.257
He is kind of heart,
and as for his manners,

34:45.257 --> 34:47.081
I should be the making of them.

34:49.257 --> 34:51.456
He called you his soul's darling.
In front of everyone.

34:51.458 --> 34:52.618
I know!

34:55.257 --> 34:58.258
Then he must propose
marriage tomorrow.

35:01.258 --> 35:03.257
I shall be the happiest
little orphan in London.

35:03.258 --> 35:06.257
And we, too, shall be happy wives

35:06.258 --> 35:08.258
and sisters forever.

35:29.123 --> 35:30.763
Sedley!

35:31.763 --> 35:32.763
Wake up!

35:32.764 --> 35:35.763
No, no, no... Too loud. Too loud.

35:37.763 --> 35:40.762
I do believe I'm very terrible
when I'm roused.

35:40.763 --> 35:41.763
Terrible? You're pathetic!

35:41.764 --> 35:43.122
George,

35:43.123 --> 35:44.282
be kind.

35:44.283 --> 35:47.122
He made a complete fool of himself
and his sister with his...

35:47.123 --> 35:48.762
crying and singing.

35:48.763 --> 35:49.763
I never sing!

35:51.763 --> 35:53.602
On Richmond Hill,
there lives a lass

35:53.603 --> 35:55.762
more bright than
something something.

35:55.763 --> 35:58.762
My dearest
diddle-diddle-darling.

35:58.763 --> 36:00.443
My soul's delight.

36:01.763 --> 36:03.762
And you let her ogle you
and flatter you, and...

36:03.763 --> 36:04.763
Tell him, Dobbin.

36:04.764 --> 36:07.762
There's nobody else for me.
I worship her!

36:07.763 --> 36:08.763
She worships your money.

36:08.764 --> 36:10.762
Have mercy, George!

36:10.763 --> 36:12.762
There's nobody else for me, Dobs.

36:12.763 --> 36:14.762
I know.

36:14.763 --> 36:16.762
I'm a liberal man.
But I've got my pride.

36:16.763 --> 36:20.762
And when I marry Amelia,
I want a lady for my sister-in-law,

36:20.763 --> 36:22.763
not a French mistress.

36:39.763 --> 36:40.763
Thank you.

36:46.763 --> 36:47.763
I'll take that.

36:47.764 --> 36:51.762
You will not. It says clearly,
"Miss Amelia Sedley".

36:51.763 --> 36:53.802
Not Little Miss
Who Does She Think She Is.

36:53.803 --> 36:57.274
How can you be so rude to me
when I'm a guest in this house?

36:57.963 --> 36:59.763
Not for long.

37:02.763 --> 37:05.411
A letter for you, Miss Sedley.
Thank you, Sam.

37:22.763 --> 37:24.763
It's from Jos.

37:26.763 --> 37:28.763
He's gone to China.

37:30.763 --> 37:32.803
Is he coming back?

37:34.763 --> 37:36.763
He begs your forgiveness.

37:39.763 --> 37:42.282
"Entreat her to pardon
and forget every word

37:42.283 --> 37:45.763
"I may have uttered
when excited by that fatal supper."

37:55.763 --> 37:57.763
Better luck in your next life.

38:09.443 --> 38:10.762
I'm sure he'll regret it.

38:10.763 --> 38:12.962
Jos?

38:12.963 --> 38:14.763
Or George?

38:16.763 --> 38:18.762
Clearly wasn't meant to be,

38:18.763 --> 38:20.763
and that's the end of that.

38:23.603 --> 38:24.962
Moving on is something
I do know how to do.

38:24.963 --> 38:26.763
No.

38:28.763 --> 38:30.762
No, don't leave.

38:30.763 --> 38:31.763
I'm sure we can...

38:31.764 --> 38:34.963
No. No, we can't.

38:41.763 --> 38:43.762
Take it.

38:43.763 --> 38:45.803
Take both of them.

38:48.763 --> 38:50.763
I can't bear to part with you.

38:54.763 --> 38:56.763
My cornelians. Please.

39:00.763 --> 39:03.602
And be accused of
stealing your jewellery?

39:03.603 --> 39:05.762
No.
No, Amelia.

39:05.763 --> 39:07.762
Believe me,
my desire for foreign travel

39:07.763 --> 39:10.763
shall not lead me as a convict
to Australia.

39:13.763 --> 39:16.762
You are angry with me.
No. No.

39:16.763 --> 39:17.962
Not with you.

39:17.963 --> 39:19.763
With the world, perhaps.

39:29.603 --> 39:31.122
Write to me.

39:31.123 --> 39:33.762
Write to me,
and I shall write to you.

39:33.763 --> 39:36.962
I keep my letters in this box,

39:36.963 --> 39:39.603
and soon the box will be full.

39:40.763 --> 39:42.283
And we shall meet again.

39:43.763 --> 39:45.763
We shall.

39:47.283 --> 39:50.762
Meanwhile, I shall be governess

39:50.763 --> 39:52.963
and learn to love
every minute of it.

39:59.763 --> 40:01.762
Yes, yes, I promise to love you
forever and ever

40:01.763 --> 40:04.587
and ever, and tomorrow
will be better than today.

40:07.763 --> 40:09.762
The rich man at his castle,

40:09.763 --> 40:11.763
the poor man at his gate.

40:13.763 --> 40:15.762
Fortunately, I'm not a man.

40:15.763 --> 40:16.763
Drive on!

40:16.764 --> 40:18.282
Yes, indeed, miss.

40:18.283 --> 40:21.225
Happy to be of service
to such a lovely young lady.

40:24.123 --> 40:26.442
Goodbye!

40:26.443 --> 40:27.914
Thank you for everything.

40:35.603 --> 40:37.762
Ooh, that was a long week.

40:37.763 --> 40:38.763
Jos will soon forget her.

40:38.764 --> 40:40.762
Amelia will soon forget her.

40:40.763 --> 40:42.963
It's so unfair.

40:44.443 --> 40:45.762
She has no-one!

40:45.763 --> 40:48.762
Look, you don't know the world
as I do, Emmy.

40:48.763 --> 40:50.822
Your friend must learn her station.

41:58.763 --> 42:01.762
How much further?

42:01.763 --> 42:03.762
We're 'ere.

42:03.763 --> 42:04.763
Queen's Crawley.

42:07.763 --> 42:10.443
I can't even see a house!

42:37.763 --> 42:39.762
This can't be right, coachman.

42:39.763 --> 42:42.762
There's nobody home,
but I'm expected.

42:42.763 --> 42:44.802
Indeed you are, young lady.

42:44.803 --> 42:46.762
By Sir Pitt Crawley MP.

42:46.763 --> 42:49.763
Who welcomes you
to his humble abode.

42:50.763 --> 42:52.763
Sir Pitt?

42:55.803 --> 42:57.762
How can you pay a governess

42:57.763 --> 42:59.762
if you can't afford a coachman?

42:59.763 --> 43:03.762
I can afford as many
as I damn well like.

43:03.763 --> 43:05.762
But I like to drive me own horses.

43:05.763 --> 43:08.763
And I don't like
to teach me own children.

43:10.763 --> 43:11.763
Whoa.

43:11.764 --> 43:13.762
Don't mind old Gorer.

43:13.763 --> 43:15.763
He's partial to a young lady.

43:16.803 --> 43:18.763
Go now.

43:29.763 --> 43:32.763
There you go. Head on.

43:35.763 --> 43:36.763
Where is everyone?

43:36.764 --> 43:39.282
I don't like a lot of fuss
in the evening.

43:39.283 --> 43:42.762
And why is it so cold?
Cold?! Can't be.

43:42.763 --> 43:44.763
We lit a fire just this afternoon.

43:47.763 --> 43:48.803
Who's that?

43:51.763 --> 43:54.763
It's one of the Lady Crawleys.
I forget which.

44:05.763 --> 44:08.762
Gorer, get your wormy arse
off the lady's bed.

44:08.763 --> 44:09.763
Come on.

44:11.763 --> 44:13.962
Well, now, Miss Sharp,
these shall be your quarters,

44:13.963 --> 44:15.802
and very fine they are, too,
I think you'll agree.

44:15.803 --> 44:18.763
There's a lovely view here.
In the daylight.

44:20.963 --> 44:22.762
This was my wife's favourite room.

44:22.763 --> 44:25.763
Where's Lady Crawley tonight?

44:27.603 --> 44:28.763
She died.

44:29.763 --> 44:31.175
Right there in that bed.

44:33.763 --> 44:36.762
Your face!

44:36.763 --> 44:37.763
Gets them every time.

44:37.764 --> 44:39.763
Come on, lad!

44:40.763 --> 44:42.763
Sleep well.

44:49.763 --> 44:51.762
Are you sure you won't be lonely?

44:51.763 --> 44:53.762
No, certainly not.

44:53.763 --> 44:54.763
Righto.
