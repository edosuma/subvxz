00:11.803 --> 00:13.304
The court has made its decision.

00:15.890 --> 00:17.475
According to Article 36, Clause 1

00:17.559 --> 00:20.645
of the Act on Special Cases
Concerning Punishment for Child Abuse,

00:20.729 --> 00:25.483
a child abuser is forbidden to approach
their family members for a year,

00:25.567 --> 00:28.027
compelled to leave
the victim's home for a year,

00:28.611 --> 00:31.781
forbidden to approach the victim
via telecommunications for a year,

00:33.116 --> 00:35.410
divested of all parental rights
for a year,

00:37.704 --> 00:40.457
sentenced to 200 hours
of community service and training,

00:40.540 --> 00:42.500
ordered to undergo
treatment for alcoholism,

00:42.584 --> 00:43.710
and…

00:45.628 --> 00:46.963
<i>I want to show you</i>

00:47.589 --> 00:49.591
<i>that the abuser will be locked up,</i>

00:50.216 --> 00:52.218
<i>not the victim.</i>

00:53.303 --> 00:54.804
The victim will get to stay home

00:56.806 --> 00:58.641
and the perpetrator will be punished.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.268
I will

01:01.936 --> 01:02.771
show you that.

01:04.689 --> 01:05.982
<i>And…</i>

01:06.066 --> 01:09.277
sentenced to one year
in a probational facility.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.279
Well, this is not right. Come on.

01:11.362 --> 01:13.948
-I only scolded my own child--
-Under certain grounds,

01:14.032 --> 01:16.576
the protective order
can be changed or extended.

01:17.285 --> 01:20.622
If you don't follow the order
or accept the decision,

01:20.705 --> 01:23.291
this case will be sent
to the public prosecutors' office,

01:23.374 --> 01:25.460
and you may face a criminal trial.

01:25.543 --> 01:28.505
Also, the state is not obligated
to bear the expenses

01:28.588 --> 01:30.840
for alcoholism treatment.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.760
You must pay them yourself.

01:40.141 --> 01:41.267
Oh, dear.

01:45.271 --> 01:47.273
Just because you were
a victim of domestic abuse yourself,

01:48.900 --> 01:51.569
likewise using violence
towards your own family,

01:53.530 --> 01:55.448
that is still undeniably a crime.

01:56.908 --> 01:59.077
The law judges everything by facts.

01:59.160 --> 02:00.745
Because he is my dad,

02:03.706 --> 02:04.833
because he is my son.

02:06.376 --> 02:07.502
Those excuses won't work here.

02:09.629 --> 02:10.588
What only matters is

02:11.881 --> 02:13.842
so did you commit an assault

02:16.344 --> 02:17.345
or not.

02:24.978 --> 02:28.189
The trial is closed.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.738
Oh, Yu-ri.

02:43.454 --> 02:45.206
Oh, no. Won-sik.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.251
Won-sik.

02:50.837 --> 02:51.921
Oh, no.

03:06.686 --> 03:07.645
What is it?

03:08.980 --> 03:10.648
Why didn't you tell me?

03:13.693 --> 03:15.361
Your plan for Seo Yu-ri's case.

03:15.445 --> 03:17.906
If I had known,
I wouldn't have said such harsh words.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.283
You sound like you're blaming me.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.368
No, it's not that--

03:22.452 --> 03:24.787
It wasn't a division case, but mine alone.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.498
Do I have to report
all the details to you?

03:29.792 --> 03:31.961
If you're done, step aside.
You're annoying me.

03:38.718 --> 03:39.761
Mr. Seo Won-sik.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.680
You're under arrest
for assault during the trial.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.349
Assault? What the heck?

03:44.432 --> 03:46.559
<i>Life is not a fairy-tale.
No one lives a happily ever after.</i>

03:47.769 --> 03:50.188
<i>That I can assure you
as a someone who's lived up to this age.</i>

03:51.397 --> 03:55.276
<i>Only difference comes from whether or not
one overcome one's limitations.</i>

03:57.320 --> 04:00.698
That's why the courts
and the polices exist around us.

04:02.742 --> 04:04.661
Also why people like me can make a living.

04:08.873 --> 04:11.084
Don't talk back to your elders
like a rude brat.

04:12.377 --> 04:14.837
Don't talk down to people
just because you're in a bad mood.

04:15.463 --> 04:17.548
Don't let your emotions
dictate what you say.

04:19.133 --> 04:20.760
Say hello to your elders first.

04:24.639 --> 04:26.224
And even if you have
nothing to smile about,

04:27.267 --> 04:28.351
try to smile.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.272
That will bring you luck.

04:42.991 --> 04:44.284
I'm proud of you

04:45.285 --> 04:46.327
for putting up with it all.

04:49.747 --> 04:51.541
I don't like you.

04:53.167 --> 04:55.169
I talked behind your back countless times.

04:58.381 --> 05:00.925
So why are you doing this to me?

05:02.176 --> 05:04.679
Why?

05:08.933 --> 05:10.643
I really hate you.

05:16.441 --> 05:17.650
BAD FAMILY SITUATION

05:23.406 --> 05:24.324
MESSAGES

05:24.407 --> 05:27.952
I WON'T COMMIT CRIMES ANYMORE
I'LL WORK HARD

05:50.975 --> 05:52.518
One more glass, please.

06:02.361 --> 06:04.572
I guess the apple doesn't fall far
from the tree.

06:05.823 --> 06:08.826
I really hated it when my father drank.

06:09.535 --> 06:11.913
So I promised myself

06:12.997 --> 06:16.042
that I'd never touch alcohol.

06:20.338 --> 06:21.672
But it tastes so sweet.

06:26.010 --> 06:27.553
I'm sorry, Judge Sim.

06:29.138 --> 06:30.306
This is what I

06:31.307 --> 06:33.101
should have said first.

06:34.685 --> 06:37.563
I was ashamed of myself
for saying such harsh words.

06:44.237 --> 06:47.073
You know I'm an outlier, right?

06:48.616 --> 06:51.786
Most judges have a degree
from the National Law School.

06:53.079 --> 06:56.707
But I only have a GED,
which is a rarity in this field.

06:58.960 --> 07:02.839
I studied really hard
to work at a juvenile court.

07:05.716 --> 07:06.759
Seriously.

07:08.094 --> 07:11.848
I studied so hard
that I even got blisters on my butt.

07:12.974 --> 07:14.517
Why did you try so hard?

07:18.396 --> 07:20.440
Hoping that they wouldn't live like me.

07:29.574 --> 07:31.534
TRANSPORT
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

07:32.660 --> 07:36.581
<i>Cha Tae-ju is sentenced to probation
number 10 for attempted patricide.</i>

07:52.597 --> 07:55.016
I hate my past.

08:16.579 --> 08:17.830
I owe a lot to you…

08:20.041 --> 08:21.250
for this trial.

08:24.921 --> 08:27.173
Children who suffer from domestic abuse.

08:27.256 --> 08:28.966
Children like that never grow up.

08:29.884 --> 08:32.220
Ten years? Twenty years?

08:33.262 --> 08:36.140
Time will pass by,

08:36.891 --> 08:40.353
but they will just remain
as an abused child regardless of that.

08:43.439 --> 08:45.816
I used what you said
to persuade Yu-ri's grandmother.

08:47.068 --> 08:49.320
When she heard that, she just cried

08:51.364 --> 08:52.740
without saying anything.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.161
Gosh.

08:57.245 --> 08:59.205
Grown-ups don't know

09:00.540 --> 09:03.376
how much it hurts their children.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.882
That's why my mother
always brings me dried squid.

09:13.844 --> 09:15.555
I never touch it

09:16.514 --> 09:18.558
because it was that jerk's favorite.

09:20.309 --> 09:22.353
My father was just like…

09:24.730 --> 09:25.856
Yu-ri's father.

09:26.440 --> 09:27.984
<i>She's a victim.</i>

09:28.067 --> 09:30.403
Don't you care about her at all?
She needs to be protected.

09:30.486 --> 09:32.613
Why are you cornering her like that?

09:38.327 --> 09:39.537
When I was little,

09:40.871 --> 09:42.623
not the judge in charge of me,

09:42.707 --> 09:45.751
there was another judge who helped me.

09:46.460 --> 09:48.254
He whipped me into shape.

09:49.880 --> 09:50.715
Are you nuts?

09:51.716 --> 09:54.385
You turned the whole facility upside down.
You know that?

09:55.261 --> 09:58.097
I also came here right after a hearing
to catch you.

09:59.390 --> 10:01.267
The judge in charge of you is in a panic.

10:03.227 --> 10:04.437
Think of your mother.

10:06.731 --> 10:07.982
Don't you feel sorry for her?

10:13.529 --> 10:15.156
If you do, get your act together.

10:16.657 --> 10:17.617
Please.

10:24.624 --> 10:25.916
<i>After I passed the bar exam,</i>

10:26.792 --> 10:28.711
I was going to visit him.

10:29.545 --> 10:30.630
But I couldn't.

10:31.547 --> 10:32.923
I lost contact with him.

10:35.801 --> 10:38.179
I'm not sure if I couldn't or didn't.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.932
Now that over 10 years have passed,

10:43.059 --> 10:45.019
I can't quite remember his face.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.730
I'm…

10:48.773 --> 10:49.857
I'm so regretful now.

10:51.275 --> 10:53.361
I should've at least asked his name.

10:55.696 --> 10:58.366
<i>But I think that he's probably become</i>

10:58.449 --> 11:01.077
<i>a better judge somewhere</i>

11:02.078 --> 11:04.121
<i>because he was born to be a judge.</i>

11:08.668 --> 11:11.128
I've worked in the courts for 22 years.

11:13.881 --> 11:15.675
It's now time for a change.

11:23.140 --> 11:24.225
I'll leave the court

11:25.184 --> 11:26.435
and join

11:28.604 --> 11:29.772
the National Assembly.

11:33.984 --> 11:34.985
Oh, boy.

11:36.779 --> 11:39.615
I'd have a lot to say if I saw him again.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.168
Let's drink, shall we?

12:29.081 --> 12:30.040
MISSED CALL

12:30.124 --> 12:33.669
WHERE ARE YOU HIDING AGAIN?
DO YOU THINK I WON'T BE ABLE TO FIND YOU?

12:35.212 --> 12:37.673
COURT

12:37.756 --> 12:39.925
-Good morning, Judge Cha.
-Good morning.

12:40.009 --> 12:42.428
Have this. I bought two and got one free.

12:42.511 --> 12:44.221
Thank you for the drink.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.348
ASSOCIATE JUDGE'S OFFICE

12:52.771 --> 12:54.064
Good morning.

12:54.148 --> 12:55.357
Hi.

12:55.441 --> 12:57.526
For a moment, I thought it was Monday.

12:59.153 --> 13:00.654
You worked late on Friday as well.

13:01.530 --> 13:02.656
I have a lot to read.

13:11.165 --> 13:13.125
Well, it was "buy one, get one free."

13:15.586 --> 13:17.254
Actually, I'm grateful to you, too.

13:19.298 --> 13:22.760
You listened to my story when I was drunk.

13:25.262 --> 13:27.640
Actually, it was my first time
talking about myself--

13:27.723 --> 13:29.099
It made me uncomfortable.

13:30.851 --> 13:34.230
When my colleagues talk
about their personal lives and secrets,

13:35.648 --> 13:37.024
it's pretty bothersome.

13:37.775 --> 13:39.026
I don't like it

13:40.110 --> 13:41.320
when others know about me.

13:42.947 --> 13:43.948
I see.

13:46.992 --> 13:48.911
I missed the chance to tell you this then.

13:51.247 --> 13:54.458
We're here together to work.
Then let's just work.

13:56.252 --> 13:57.169
Okay.

14:05.636 --> 14:07.388
Counsel. Your statement.

14:08.222 --> 14:10.015
Hyeon-ji admits to the charge

14:10.099 --> 14:12.643
of making a fraudulent deal
on an online thrift store

14:12.726 --> 14:14.395
and regrets it deeply.

14:14.979 --> 14:17.606
Her father also promised
that he'd take better care of her

14:17.690 --> 14:20.067
if you impose a mild punishment on her.

14:21.068 --> 14:22.611
We ask for leniency.

14:23.862 --> 14:26.156
Mr. Yoo. In the previous trial,

14:27.324 --> 14:30.494
the court asked you to go
to an alcoholism counseling center.

14:31.787 --> 14:32.788
But you stopped going.

14:33.706 --> 14:36.876
I had to work,
so I couldn't go every time.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.460
But you should have still gone!

14:38.544 --> 14:41.046
Hyeon-ji won't change if you don't.

14:42.339 --> 14:43.465
I'm sorry.

14:47.177 --> 14:48.888
Do you work steadily these days?

14:49.555 --> 14:52.349
The economy is so bad right now…

14:52.433 --> 14:55.144
-You're a day laborer, correct?
-Yes.

14:55.227 --> 14:57.563
We'll send you
to a vocational counseling center.

14:57.646 --> 14:58.856
Get counseling.

15:00.274 --> 15:01.483
And make sure to return

15:04.403 --> 15:05.738
the 60,000 won

15:06.739 --> 15:10.576
you obtained fraudulently
to the victim, okay?

15:11.994 --> 15:13.162
Yes, Your Honor.

15:14.580 --> 15:17.082
Yoo Hyeon-ji. In the previous trials,

15:17.166 --> 15:18.417
I gave you two chances.

15:19.877 --> 15:22.004
But here you are in court again.

15:23.631 --> 15:24.715
I'm sorry.

15:24.798 --> 15:27.217
That's too bad.
Since it's the third time, you're out.

15:30.387 --> 15:32.932
The court has reached a decision.
The court sentences Yoo Hyeon-ji

15:33.015 --> 15:35.225
to a year of probation

15:35.309 --> 15:36.936
and a year
at a juvenile protection institution.

15:37.019 --> 15:38.020
Your Honor.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.108
Hyeon-ji.

15:45.069 --> 15:46.320
Your Honor.

15:47.196 --> 15:48.739
-Hyeon-ji…
-You must leave now.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.660
Hyeon-ji?

15:54.495 --> 15:56.455
<i>Let's change Hyeon-ji's sentence.</i>

15:56.538 --> 15:58.540
When she's released
from the juvenile classification center,

15:58.624 --> 15:59.917
send her to a juvenile care home

16:00.751 --> 16:02.419
instead of a protection institution.

16:02.503 --> 16:03.963
Not Shalom, but Pureum.

16:04.046 --> 16:07.091
It weighs on your mind, doesn't it?

16:09.635 --> 16:10.636
It's meaningless.

16:11.220 --> 16:14.723
Yes, sir. I'll call
Pureum Home for Girls right away.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.309
Also, tell them that we'll be
conducting an inspection this week.

16:17.393 --> 16:18.227
Yes, sir.

16:20.813 --> 16:23.023
What did he mean by that earlier?

16:23.107 --> 16:24.900
Why was the sentencing meaningless?

16:24.984 --> 16:27.611
How much did Hyeon-ji get from
her scam this time?

16:27.695 --> 16:29.989
-Just 60,000 won.
-Exactly. Just 60,000 won.

16:30.948 --> 16:34.743
We can't send her to a reformatory
just for 60,000 won, right?

16:34.827 --> 16:35.869
Right.

16:35.953 --> 16:39.915
But he can't send her back home.
He already gave her two chances.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.876
So he was going to
put her in a protection institution,

16:43.877 --> 16:45.629
<i>but then he questioned himself</i>

16:45.713 --> 16:48.215
<i>whether it was
an appropriate punishment for her.</i>

16:49.049 --> 16:51.468
<i>She's 14,
so she can't even work part-time.</i>

16:51.552 --> 16:53.178
<i>And no one in her family has an income.</i>

16:53.846 --> 16:57.349
<i>That's why she did it.
She did it to survive.</i>

16:58.600 --> 17:01.353
Her alcoholic father,
who doesn't take care of his daughter,

17:01.437 --> 17:03.188
is the cause of the problem.

17:03.814 --> 17:07.860
So he thought it was meaningless to impose
a severe punishment on the child.

17:07.943 --> 17:10.279
That's why he changed his mind

17:10.362 --> 17:12.448
to send her to a juvenile care home

17:12.531 --> 17:14.908
where she will be put under
the care of a foster family.

17:14.992 --> 17:15.868
I see.

17:15.951 --> 17:18.704
He gave her a better environment
instead of punishing her.

17:18.787 --> 17:20.748
And while she's staying there,

17:20.831 --> 17:22.750
her father can undergo
alcoholism treatment

17:22.833 --> 17:26.462
and get job counseling to build up
the strength to raise his child again.

17:26.545 --> 17:29.631
They say each court decision shows
what the judge in charge is like.

17:29.715 --> 17:31.508
That's quite unexpected.

17:31.592 --> 17:32.468
Unexpected?

17:32.551 --> 17:34.803
I'll tell Presiding Judge Kang
that you said that.

17:35.429 --> 17:37.890
You just don't know it.
He's actually a good person.

17:37.973 --> 17:40.559
By the way, why is it always Pureum?

17:41.310 --> 17:42.352
WELCOME
PUREUM HOME FOR GIRLS

17:42.436 --> 17:45.647
<i>Well, it's the first juvenile care home
established by our court.</i>

17:45.731 --> 17:47.858
<i>And, most importantly,
it's run by Ms. O Seon-ja.</i>

17:47.941 --> 17:49.234
LETTER OF APPOINTMENT
O SEON-JA

17:49.318 --> 17:52.905
I know this has many questions,
but take it seriously.

17:52.988 --> 17:54.406
-Do it honestly.
-Jeez.

17:54.490 --> 17:55.908
Write down your names.

17:55.991 --> 17:56.909
PERSONALITY ASSESSMENT SURVEY

17:56.992 --> 17:59.870
Yu-gyeong. Are you doing okay these days?

18:01.455 --> 18:04.291
-Yes.
-There are many reasons for anxiety.

18:05.667 --> 18:07.628
For example, your future is uncertain.

18:07.711 --> 18:10.464
Or you think your future is doomed.

18:10.547 --> 18:14.051
Eun-sol got a good score on the GED

18:14.134 --> 18:16.095
-and got two cooking certificates.
-Yes.

18:16.178 --> 18:20.891
So I suggest that she should go
to a culinary arts school.

18:20.974 --> 18:24.645
Thank you. Thank you so much.

18:26.230 --> 18:28.107
Don't thank me. Eun-sol did all the work.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.025
-What?
-Look at that.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.485
Hey, what the…

18:31.568 --> 18:32.694
Look, a hole! Hey, guys.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.613
-Want some <i>gimbap</i>?
-Are you done?

18:34.696 --> 18:36.073
We're still on it.

18:36.156 --> 18:37.825
You guys made a mess.

18:37.908 --> 18:41.120
-This is more delicious. Here you go.
-Okay.

18:41.745 --> 18:43.872
Ms. O Seon-ja runs Pureum?

18:43.956 --> 18:46.500
O Seon-ja, the star lecturer
and youth counselor?

18:46.583 --> 18:47.626
Yes.

18:49.044 --> 18:50.129
That's awesome.

18:50.712 --> 18:54.716
But it's rumored
that she has a bad temper.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.427
Hey, go out and see if you can find

18:57.511 --> 19:00.389
a good-natured person among those
who deal with young offenders?

19:00.472 --> 19:02.057
This concerns their lives.

19:02.141 --> 19:05.018
Do you think just anybody can
stomach this work, moron?

19:06.270 --> 19:08.897
You're right. Well, the people
in this court prove that.

19:08.981 --> 19:12.609
And above all else,
Pureum's program is different.

19:12.693 --> 19:15.070
Psychology consultation,
career counseling,

19:15.154 --> 19:16.655
and even coaching for guardians.

19:17.656 --> 19:19.449
As you all know,

19:19.533 --> 19:22.828
we have to start inspecting
the facilities in the coming week.

19:22.911 --> 19:24.955
Reformatories,
juvenile classification centers,

19:25.038 --> 19:28.292
Cheonurye, the protection institution,
and the juvenile care homes.

19:28.375 --> 19:31.128
The court has to inspect all the
affiliated facilities once a year

19:31.211 --> 19:32.629
to check the conditions

19:32.713 --> 19:35.299
and to see if they're taking
good care of young offenders

19:35.382 --> 19:37.301
or if they've committed
any irregularities.

19:37.926 --> 19:40.387
If a prisoner escapes from prison,

19:41.221 --> 19:43.182
judges don't need to go after them.

19:43.265 --> 19:45.684
But if a young offender escapes
from one of these homes,

19:45.767 --> 19:48.896
juvenile judges have to either
go after them or find a way to catch them.

19:48.979 --> 19:52.983
Why? Because juvenile judges
have to supervise them as well.

19:53.567 --> 19:57.029
Well, I was thinking we should
inspect the juvenile care home first.

19:57.112 --> 19:59.198
Isn't this your first time?

19:59.781 --> 20:00.616
Yes.

20:00.699 --> 20:02.743
The previous court I was with
didn't have affiliated homes.

20:02.826 --> 20:05.287
Very well. It'll be helpful
to see them yourself.

20:05.370 --> 20:07.581
Judge Cha couldn't go last year.
It's his first time, too.

20:07.664 --> 20:09.458
-Yes.
-Make some time tomorrow

20:09.541 --> 20:11.835
and let's all go together. Okay?

20:13.045 --> 20:17.466
Both of you are visiting
Pureum Home for Girls tomorrow, right?

20:17.549 --> 20:18.759
-Yes.
-Then I suggest

20:18.842 --> 20:21.136
you leave at eleven o'clock at the latest

20:21.720 --> 20:23.972
and have lunch at a rest area.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.641
Because it's located in Nonsan.

20:25.724 --> 20:26.934
I see.

20:27.017 --> 20:29.895
Juvenile care homes
are not state-run detainment facilities

20:29.978 --> 20:31.980
but typical family homes,

20:32.064 --> 20:34.066
and the state can't
properly support them financially.

20:34.858 --> 20:36.568
That's why they're not
in the metropolitan area,

20:37.194 --> 20:39.029
since housing costs are quite high.

20:40.113 --> 20:42.115
PUREUM HOME FOR GIRLS

20:44.201 --> 20:46.828
PUREUM HOME FOR GIRLS

20:50.040 --> 20:52.334
<i>Hello.</i>

20:52.417 --> 20:56.255
<i>I'm O Seon-ja, the elderly friend
of the youth. Nice to meet you.</i>

20:57.756 --> 21:00.842
<i>All right.
Let me ask you a question first.</i>

21:00.926 --> 21:04.638
<i>Everyone. What's the question
that children hate to be asked the most?</i>

21:04.721 --> 21:05.931
<i>Yes, that's right.</i>

21:06.014 --> 21:09.643
<i>Children hate all questions
asked by grown-ups.</i>

21:09.726 --> 21:12.187
<i>Yes, that's the correct answer.</i>

21:13.063 --> 21:14.439
<i>There are two reasons.</i>

21:14.523 --> 21:18.068
<i>First is because
they assume you have an ulterior motive.</i>

21:18.151 --> 21:20.654
<i>"What is my mom trying
to nag me about this time?"</i>

21:20.737 --> 21:21.863
<i>That's what they think.</i>

21:21.947 --> 21:24.741
<i>The second is this. What is your dream?</i>

21:27.911 --> 21:30.372
I'm sorry that you have to
go through this trouble.

21:30.455 --> 21:32.457
I'll drive on the way back.

21:32.541 --> 21:36.628
No, sir. It's nice to be outside,
getting some fresh air.

21:37.421 --> 21:38.797
That's good to hear.

21:39.589 --> 21:42.092
Why don't you get some sleep
on our way there?

21:42.175 --> 21:44.011
We'll wake you up
when we get to a rest area.

21:44.094 --> 21:47.597
No. That's not polite to the driver.

22:04.656 --> 22:06.408
LIST OF GIRLS AT PUREUM HOME FOR GIRLS

22:06.491 --> 22:07.951
A total of eight girls.

22:08.535 --> 22:11.830
Prostitution, fraud, theft, assault…

22:13.081 --> 22:14.666
One even received a disposition notice.

22:14.750 --> 22:16.168
It's the complete package.

22:18.170 --> 22:22.591
-Are the highlighted ones from our court?
-Yes. This home is only for girls.

22:23.175 --> 22:26.970
<i>Choi Yeong-na, O Yeon-ji,
and Woo Min-gyeong. It's these three.</i>

22:27.554 --> 22:29.723
Yeong-na is the girl you're in charge of.

22:29.806 --> 22:32.559
She was detained at
a protection institution for prostitution.

22:32.642 --> 22:35.729
Choi Yeong-na. Do you have any last words?

22:37.689 --> 22:40.108
I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

22:41.193 --> 22:43.737
I'm in charge of Yeon-ji and Min-gyeong,

22:43.820 --> 22:46.114
who were put on probation
for assault and theft.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.616
It's run by a married couple?

22:48.366 --> 22:49.201
Well…

22:49.284 --> 22:50.827
Technically speaking, no.

22:50.911 --> 22:53.663
Her husband, who works for a conglomerate,

22:53.747 --> 22:55.999
was assigned to an overseas branch
two years ago,

22:56.083 --> 22:57.834
so Ms. O is running it by herself now.

22:58.460 --> 22:59.795
With her two young daughters.

23:01.171 --> 23:02.130
She's amazing.

23:02.714 --> 23:05.092
She takes care of ten children by herself?

23:08.053 --> 23:10.013
Gosh, where did he go again?

23:10.597 --> 23:11.640
YEONHWA DISTRICT COURT

23:11.723 --> 23:13.850
Hello?
Juvenile Criminal Collegiate Division.

23:14.893 --> 23:16.144
Yes, go ahead and speak.

23:18.230 --> 23:21.483
Sorry? What are you saying?

23:26.822 --> 23:29.825
PUREUM HOME FOR GIRLS

23:32.160 --> 23:33.703
We're from Yeonhwa District Court.

23:39.501 --> 23:40.585
-Hello.
-Hello.

23:40.669 --> 23:41.670
-Hello.
-Hi.

23:42.462 --> 23:45.048
Hey. How have you been?

23:46.550 --> 23:47.676
Hi, Ms. Joo.

23:48.301 --> 23:51.388
<i>Judge Cha. I'm calling you because
I can't reach Presiding Judge Kang.</i>

23:51.471 --> 23:53.723
Well, someone

23:55.267 --> 23:57.602
just made a report to our office.

23:57.686 --> 23:58.687
YEONHWA DISTRICT COURT

23:58.770 --> 24:01.439
Are you sure of what you just said?

24:01.523 --> 24:03.525
Child abuse and embezzlement
at one of the facilities?

24:03.608 --> 24:06.236
If that's true,
it is a really serious matter.

24:07.362 --> 24:08.780
And where is that?

24:10.282 --> 24:12.659
Oh, dear. Hey, girls. Why are you out?

24:13.243 --> 24:15.203
I told you not to come out all at once
when we have visitors.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.205
Go back in at once. Go back in.

24:17.289 --> 24:18.665
-Hello.
-Hi.

24:18.748 --> 24:21.001
-Are you doing well?
-Of course. Go on in, please.

24:21.084 --> 24:24.880
<i>It's Pureum. Pureum Home for Girls.</i>

24:24.963 --> 24:26.298
Did you guys say hello?

24:26.381 --> 24:28.133
-Yes.
-Hurry up and go back in.

24:28.216 --> 24:29.843
Go and get things ready, okay?

24:29.926 --> 24:31.094
Are you sure it's Pureum?

24:31.178 --> 24:32.971
<i>Yes. I couldn't believe it either,
so I asked several times.</i>

24:33.054 --> 24:34.681
<i>It's definitely Pureum.</i>

24:34.764 --> 24:38.101
But it's only a suspicion, so just take it
for what it's worth during the inspection.

24:38.185 --> 24:39.936
Okay. I'll do that.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.230
Bye.

24:52.324 --> 24:53.450
Judge Cha Tae-ju?

24:53.533 --> 24:54.534
Yes.

24:54.618 --> 24:58.288
I've heard a lot about you.
I'm O Seon-ja, I run the care home.

24:58.371 --> 24:59.289
I see.

24:59.372 --> 25:02.876
-My hands are dirty.
-It's okay. I'm Cha Tae-ju.

25:02.959 --> 25:04.252
-Please go on in.
-Okay.

25:10.759 --> 25:13.261
CONGRATULATIONS ON COMPLETING
PUREUM HOME FOR GIRLS

25:16.181 --> 25:17.933
-All right.
-Get up and greet them properly.

25:18.016 --> 25:20.060
-It's been a while. Let's take a picture.
-Yes.

25:20.810 --> 25:23.146
-Who can take it for us?
-I'll do it.

25:23.230 --> 25:24.689
Okay.

25:25.273 --> 25:26.775
-You guys, too.
-Here.

25:27.943 --> 25:29.027
-Sit down.
-Hello.

25:29.110 --> 25:30.862
Yeon-ji and Min-gyeong, how have you been?

25:30.946 --> 25:33.073
Judge Cha. Come here
and take a picture with us.

25:33.156 --> 25:34.407
Come here, guys.

25:34.491 --> 25:35.575
-Hurry.
-Here.

25:35.659 --> 25:36.993
You two. Come and take a picture with us
after this, okay?

25:37.077 --> 25:38.078
Don't worry about them.

25:38.161 --> 25:39.788
-All right.
-They're my daughters.

25:39.871 --> 25:41.122
I see!

25:41.915 --> 25:44.209
They're better at taking photos
than being in them.

25:44.292 --> 25:45.710
All right. Ready?

25:46.294 --> 25:47.963
One, two, three.

25:49.381 --> 25:50.924
One, two, three.

25:52.092 --> 25:53.551
You should join us, Judge Cha.

25:53.635 --> 25:54.719
-Good.
-Okay.

25:54.803 --> 25:57.222
Well, Presiding Judge Kang.
I have something to tell you.

25:57.305 --> 25:58.265
Okay. Go ahead.

25:58.890 --> 26:01.226
Now you can all go back
to what you were doing.

26:02.602 --> 26:03.895
What exactly did she say?

26:03.979 --> 26:07.315
She said someone reported
child abuse and embezzlement.

26:10.777 --> 26:12.070
Was it really Pureum?

26:12.153 --> 26:14.197
It's only a suspicion,
but she said we should take note of it.

26:14.281 --> 26:15.573
Forget it then.

26:17.784 --> 26:19.661
-Cover it up.
-Presiding Judge Kang.

26:21.162 --> 26:22.747
Try spending a day at the office.

26:22.831 --> 26:24.457
They get that kind of call
several times a day.

26:25.208 --> 26:27.460
They say their kids have been abused
or that they were blackmailed

26:27.544 --> 26:29.796
while claiming to be
the child's parent, uncle, or aunt.

26:29.879 --> 26:31.006
Do you know why?

26:31.589 --> 26:33.842
Because they want the court
to suspect the facilities.

26:34.634 --> 26:36.845
That will get them out of here sooner.

26:36.928 --> 26:38.888
No matter how many false reports we get,

26:38.972 --> 26:42.183
I think it's the court's duty
to look into them.

26:42.267 --> 26:45.854
Since we're the ones sending them here,
we have to be responsible.

26:49.816 --> 26:53.069
Considering the seriousness of the matter,
we should look into it thoroughly, sir.

26:53.153 --> 26:55.405
ASSEMBLYMAN EOM JUN-GI
DO YOU HAVE TIME? LET'S HAVE DINNER.

26:59.576 --> 27:00.827
I clearly told you.

27:01.536 --> 27:03.204
Don't do it.

27:04.581 --> 27:07.334
Well, then…

27:07.417 --> 27:08.418
The inspection…

27:09.085 --> 27:10.628
You two will be fine alone, right?

27:10.712 --> 27:11.921
Sorry?

27:12.756 --> 27:14.132
It was the TV station.

27:14.215 --> 27:16.092
I have to go now.

27:16.676 --> 27:17.552
But…

27:18.053 --> 27:19.554
-Wait, Presiding Judge Kang.
-What?

27:19.637 --> 27:21.514
It's both our first time
doing an inspection here.

27:21.598 --> 27:24.225
It's not any different from other places.

27:24.309 --> 27:25.602
Just do what you usually do.

27:34.986 --> 27:37.072
Yeon-ji.

27:37.155 --> 27:38.323
You too, Hye-rim.

27:38.406 --> 27:41.493
And then after that…

27:42.535 --> 27:45.497
The books, receipts,
event photos, and bankbooks

27:45.580 --> 27:49.042
that you requested are all in the office.

27:50.585 --> 27:52.545
-Put the tea over there.
-Okay.

27:57.092 --> 27:59.552
Since there were fewer kids here
than at a protection institution,

27:59.636 --> 28:01.179
I thought we'd be done soon.

28:02.138 --> 28:05.266
But there's more to check than I thought.
How should we do this?

28:13.566 --> 28:16.361
Should we just go home?
I'm about to be pretty annoyed.

28:16.444 --> 28:18.863
I'm sorry. I was lost in thought.

28:20.573 --> 28:22.534
I know how you feel,

28:22.617 --> 28:24.536
but do you really think
it's the court's duty?

28:25.161 --> 28:26.037
Sorry?

28:26.121 --> 28:28.331
No matter how many false reports we get,

28:29.082 --> 28:32.001
I think it's the court's duty
to look into them.

28:32.085 --> 28:34.212
It's not just about finding out
whether or not it's a lie.

28:36.047 --> 28:38.383
To some people,

28:38.466 --> 28:42.137
the court's inspection could be seen as
unfair and unreasonable.

28:43.221 --> 28:45.682
When the state
designates a home like this one,

28:45.765 --> 28:47.809
they need to review
all those who are involved

28:47.892 --> 28:49.728
and check the many requisites
they must meet.

28:49.811 --> 28:51.020
Because it's closely tied

28:51.896 --> 28:54.232
with government offices
and all kinds of permits.

28:54.315 --> 28:56.192
It isn't just about our court.

28:57.068 --> 29:00.697
That's why Presiding Judge Kang
disapproved and why we should be discreet.

29:01.656 --> 29:03.783
Yes, I'm aware of that.

29:06.828 --> 29:08.496
DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE

29:08.580 --> 29:10.165
And if your suspicion is right,

29:10.248 --> 29:12.667
they'll be exposed
even if we don't do anything.

29:13.918 --> 29:17.589
because children are impatient.

29:21.551 --> 29:22.552
Mom.

29:23.261 --> 29:24.596
Goodness, my daughter.

29:25.513 --> 29:27.599
Thank you.

29:27.682 --> 29:30.310
You're the best. Oh, dear.

29:34.272 --> 29:35.690
This is nice.

29:37.817 --> 29:39.527
Where are A-jin and the other girls?

29:40.195 --> 29:42.864
She's holed up upstairs
and won't come out even if I call her.

29:43.531 --> 29:45.325
That rude bitch, for God's sake.

29:45.408 --> 29:48.077
Can you please stop cursing?

29:50.371 --> 29:53.458
The girls on duty went to the senior home
and the rest are being questioned.

29:54.584 --> 29:55.460
Questioned?

29:56.669 --> 29:57.545
What do you mean?

29:57.629 --> 29:59.339
I don't know. The judges called them.

29:59.422 --> 30:01.299
Isn't it part of the inspection?

30:01.382 --> 30:02.884
What are you saying?

30:03.510 --> 30:04.928
This isn't the first time they visited.

30:05.011 --> 30:06.888
Since when did they interview the kids?

30:07.472 --> 30:08.807
Mom.

30:08.890 --> 30:10.058
When did they take them?

30:10.767 --> 30:11.726
A while ago.

30:15.104 --> 30:16.356
<i>She's the devil.</i>

30:17.732 --> 30:20.652
The juvenile classification center
was much better.

30:21.653 --> 30:23.363
This place is shit.

30:25.573 --> 30:26.991
Can you elaborate on that?

30:48.012 --> 30:49.222
Let's eat.

30:49.806 --> 30:53.393
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you for the food.

30:53.476 --> 30:54.686
It's a sin to leave leftovers.

30:54.769 --> 30:57.397
If you leave any,
you're having it for dinner. Got it?

30:57.480 --> 30:58.773
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

31:08.616 --> 31:09.951
Ms. O.

31:10.785 --> 31:12.745
This rice seems to have gone bad.

31:12.829 --> 31:15.206
What are you saying? It's edible.

31:15.290 --> 31:16.207
It won't kill you.

31:16.291 --> 31:17.834
But still, this is…

31:18.418 --> 31:19.878
Can you give us another?

31:24.549 --> 31:25.633
Gosh.

31:27.635 --> 31:29.554
You wouldn't have had
any better back home.

31:29.637 --> 31:30.847
Why are you so picky?

31:31.681 --> 31:34.100
Don't eat then. You don't deserve it.

31:34.183 --> 31:35.852
I'm sorry, Ms. O.

31:35.935 --> 31:37.729
I'll eat it. Please let me eat.

31:37.812 --> 31:39.105
Aren't you done eating?

31:39.772 --> 31:42.150
Since you're finished,
go back to your room.

31:43.234 --> 31:44.235
Please forgive me.

31:44.319 --> 31:45.570
Darn it!

31:46.738 --> 31:49.240
Whining at the table, damn it.

31:49.324 --> 31:51.409
Don't cry or I'll beat you.

31:52.118 --> 31:54.329
Crying doesn't solve anything here.

31:56.623 --> 31:57.665
Go upstairs.

32:00.668 --> 32:02.712
Go ahead and eat.
You have to go to school.

32:05.256 --> 32:06.758
This early in the morning?

32:07.759 --> 32:09.636
What a nuisance.

32:13.473 --> 32:15.767
<i>She did that to all of us.</i>

32:15.850 --> 32:18.061
She treats us like shit
because she feeds us.

32:18.686 --> 32:20.313
But she gives us spoiled food.

32:20.396 --> 32:24.067
And she makes us do laundry,
clean the house, or wash dishes.

32:24.150 --> 32:26.277
We clean our neighbors' houses too

32:26.361 --> 32:27.445
like bums.

32:30.031 --> 32:32.659
She starves us if we don't work.

32:32.742 --> 32:35.078
I was told not to tell others about this.

32:35.161 --> 32:36.788
Just tell us.

32:36.871 --> 32:39.499
Actually, one of the girls
is in a hospital now.

32:40.667 --> 32:41.960
For God's sake!

32:42.627 --> 32:44.420
Hey. Hey!

32:44.504 --> 32:45.546
Come here.

32:46.339 --> 32:49.300
Come here. How dare you?

32:49.968 --> 32:52.095
-How dare you?
-Please forgive me!

32:52.178 --> 32:55.056
-Do you want to die or what?
-Please forgive me!

32:55.139 --> 32:58.643
How dare you talk back?
Do you think I'm your buddy?

32:59.602 --> 33:02.105
-Damn it! Watch your mouth.
-Please, stop.

33:02.188 --> 33:03.356
Her name is Do Yu-gyeong.

33:03.982 --> 33:06.401
She talked back to her once and…

33:06.484 --> 33:08.528
You know what happens
if you lie to us, right?

33:08.611 --> 33:09.737
It's true.

33:29.090 --> 33:31.467
But why is this not in the following year?

33:32.427 --> 33:33.761
-Number one. Yes.
-Yes.

33:33.845 --> 33:34.929
A witness, maybe…

33:35.513 --> 33:36.639
Events or…

33:56.242 --> 33:57.994
-Snacks.
-Yes.

33:58.077 --> 33:59.120
-Groceries.
-Yes.

33:59.203 --> 34:00.455
Twenty…

34:00.538 --> 34:01.998
GLAMPING IN FALL
SEPTEMBER 25, 2021

34:03.082 --> 34:04.000
Got it.

34:04.751 --> 34:05.793
-It checks out.
-Okay.

34:08.337 --> 34:10.757
You've made a difficult decision.

34:12.175 --> 34:13.384
Thank you, sir.

34:13.468 --> 34:16.012
It's all thanks to Representative Eom.

34:16.888 --> 34:20.349
You look much more handsome in real life.

34:20.433 --> 34:22.060
You have sharp features.

34:22.143 --> 34:23.144
Is that so?

34:25.730 --> 34:27.231
I'm not kidding.

34:27.857 --> 34:29.442
I think you'll become a great man.

34:31.402 --> 34:33.654
He's the chairman of SY Chemicals.

34:33.738 --> 34:35.656
-He wanted to meet you badly.
-I see.

34:35.740 --> 34:37.992
Everyone in the party got help from him.

34:38.076 --> 34:41.162
Don't you worry about anything,
Presiding Judge Kang.

34:41.746 --> 34:44.248
As for me,
when I put my mind to something,

34:44.332 --> 34:46.542
I achieve it by all means.

34:46.626 --> 34:50.379
I'll make sure that you end up

34:51.172 --> 34:55.218
wearing an assemblyman's badge
in the near future.

34:57.220 --> 34:58.596
Thank you, sir.

34:58.679 --> 35:01.557
I thought it'd take you quite a while
to make the decision.

35:01.641 --> 35:03.518
Yes, I thought so too.

35:04.310 --> 35:07.480
But your words lingered in my mind.

35:09.607 --> 35:10.733
"It's time the Assembly

35:12.235 --> 35:14.278
opened its ears to the youth."

35:20.326 --> 35:22.537
Oh, boy. You know…

35:23.579 --> 35:25.873
I can be pretty scary in the courthouse.

35:29.377 --> 35:32.713
See? I'm a shrewd judge of character.

35:33.589 --> 35:35.299
It's not just the dinner.

35:35.383 --> 35:38.511
I've made plans for the entire night.

35:38.594 --> 35:40.471
You can look forward to it.

35:40.555 --> 35:42.640
All right. Let's have a drink.

35:42.723 --> 35:43.599
Okay.

35:50.690 --> 35:52.984
PUREUM HOME FOR GIRLS

35:54.610 --> 35:57.071
Did they say that I did that?

36:02.160 --> 36:04.871
It's the court that punishes them,

36:04.954 --> 36:07.999
but I'm the one
who takes care of them every day.

36:08.583 --> 36:12.670
You see them only
for two to three hours when you visit,

36:13.713 --> 36:16.132
but we're the ones who wrestle with them

36:16.215 --> 36:18.384
on a daily basis to bring about change.

36:26.309 --> 36:27.435
What's the big deal?

36:27.518 --> 36:28.686
Let's eat.

36:29.270 --> 36:32.231
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you for the food.

36:32.315 --> 36:33.566
It's a sin to leave leftovers.

36:33.649 --> 36:35.610
If you leave any,
you're having it for dinner. Got it?

36:35.693 --> 36:36.819
-Yes.
-Okay.

36:42.325 --> 36:44.243
-It's hot.
-Ms. O.

36:45.453 --> 36:48.623
I'll finish this food.
In return, would you allow us to smoke?

36:49.415 --> 36:50.291
What?

36:50.374 --> 36:53.544
Then I promise I'll behave.

36:53.628 --> 36:55.379
-Me, too.
-Don't make me laugh.

36:57.089 --> 36:58.799
-This sucks.
-I knew it wouldn't work.

36:59.675 --> 37:04.180
Come on, this isn't an institution.
We're not here to be punished.

37:04.263 --> 37:05.932
-Am I wrong, Ji-eun?
-No, not at all.

37:06.015 --> 37:08.059
-You all have lots to say, don't you?
-We do.

37:08.142 --> 37:09.769
Why are you so strict?

37:09.852 --> 37:11.562
The other homes allow smoking.

37:11.646 --> 37:14.273
Where? Which homes allow such a thing?

37:14.357 --> 37:15.650
Stop talking nonsense.

37:15.733 --> 37:18.069
-This place is too uptight.
-Just eat your meal.

37:18.152 --> 37:19.362
Dammit.

37:20.363 --> 37:22.114
Is she out of her mind?

37:22.782 --> 37:24.033
What are you doing?

37:25.117 --> 37:26.410
You just threw precious food.

37:26.494 --> 37:28.829
"You wouldn't have had
any better back home."

37:28.913 --> 37:30.665
Is that what you think?

37:31.332 --> 37:32.917
Stop glaring at me.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.460
There's a limit to my patience.

37:36.254 --> 37:37.338
Fuck it. I won't eat.

37:39.257 --> 37:41.384
Don't eat then. You don't deserve it.

37:41.467 --> 37:43.678
This early in the morning?

37:43.761 --> 37:45.096
What a nuisance.

37:45.179 --> 37:46.305
"What a nuisance."

37:47.640 --> 37:48.557
Be quiet and eat.

37:58.776 --> 38:03.239
I seriously contemplated
whether I should let her smoke.

38:03.823 --> 38:06.367
She said she'd behave if I let her.

38:06.450 --> 38:08.661
She said the other homes turn a blind eye.

38:09.412 --> 38:10.538
But that's not right.

38:10.621 --> 38:12.623
No schools allow their students to smoke.

38:13.207 --> 38:15.293
I don't allow my own children to smoke.

38:15.376 --> 38:16.460
They said

38:17.128 --> 38:19.005
you also made them work

38:19.755 --> 38:21.007
at your neighbors' houses.

38:22.842 --> 38:25.177
Is that what they said?

38:28.681 --> 38:29.640
Judge Cha.

38:30.308 --> 38:34.729
How long do you think it takes
to build a place like this in Korea?

38:35.521 --> 38:36.397
Sorry?

38:36.480 --> 38:38.941
I don't know. Maybe one or two years?

38:39.025 --> 38:40.026
Four years.

38:40.860 --> 38:42.737
It took this place four years.

38:44.155 --> 38:45.990
An eyesore facility!

38:46.073 --> 38:47.742
-We oppose!
-We oppose!

38:47.825 --> 38:49.660
LAND RESERVED FOR
PUREUM HOME FOR GIRLS

38:49.744 --> 38:52.830
<i>That's the time it took
to get consent from the people</i>

38:52.913 --> 38:55.666
<i>in this neighborhood
even before construction began.</i>

38:55.750 --> 38:57.710
<i>No matter how young the children here are,</i>

38:57.793 --> 39:00.338
<i>they're just criminals
in the eyes of regular people.</i>

39:00.421 --> 39:02.965
-Sir.
-Stop building a facility for criminals!

39:03.049 --> 39:05.092
Stop it!

39:10.514 --> 39:15.061
So when kids come here,
the first things I teach them

39:15.144 --> 39:16.937
are housework and greetings.

39:17.021 --> 39:17.980
-Stop it.
-Whatever.

39:18.064 --> 39:19.565
Hey, you almost got me wet.

39:19.648 --> 39:21.484
<i>Whatever the excuse may be,</i>

39:21.567 --> 39:24.570
<i>it's true that they did wrong.</i>

39:24.653 --> 39:27.740
<i>Then there's only one way
to overcome the prejudice against them,</i>

39:28.324 --> 39:29.909
<i>which is to take the bull by the horns</i>

39:29.992 --> 39:31.577
<i>and do volunteer work.</i>

39:32.620 --> 39:34.497
High-five, grandpa!

39:34.580 --> 39:35.623
That was cool.

39:35.706 --> 39:36.665
Shake your butt.

39:37.625 --> 39:40.044
Shake your butt! Shake it!

39:41.754 --> 39:42.755
And?

39:44.090 --> 39:45.383
Have the people changed?

39:45.466 --> 39:46.842
Of course.

39:46.926 --> 39:49.303
These kids, who were used to
having fingers pointed at them,

39:49.387 --> 39:51.847
are now used to receiving compliments.

39:52.431 --> 39:54.392
Then why did they make such statements?

39:54.975 --> 39:56.352
Because they know

39:57.019 --> 39:58.687
that nothing is compulsory here.

39:59.814 --> 40:01.816
They came here because

40:01.899 --> 40:04.693
they have no guardians to look after them
or because they committed crimes.

40:04.777 --> 40:06.821
They know that
this is a juvenile care home,

40:06.904 --> 40:08.656
different from
reformatories or institutions

40:08.739 --> 40:11.492
where they are forcibly detained.

40:11.575 --> 40:15.121
They're protesting
to make the rules less strict.

40:16.831 --> 40:18.374
You were duped by them.

40:18.457 --> 40:20.543
We know that they lied to us.

40:23.879 --> 40:25.840
Yu-gyeong is in a hospital

40:25.923 --> 40:27.591
because Ms. O assaulted her?

40:28.300 --> 40:29.301
Yes.

40:34.723 --> 40:37.435
Call the hospital where Do Yu-gyeong is.

40:40.604 --> 40:41.856
Don't you know the number?

40:56.996 --> 40:58.873

<i>Hello? General Ward of Orthopedics.</i>

41:01.292 --> 41:02.960
This is Do Yu-gyeong's guardian.

41:03.669 --> 41:06.797
How is Yu-gyeong doing?

41:07.381 --> 41:09.508
<i>She's a bit lazy with her rehab exercises,</i>

41:09.592 --> 41:11.177
<i>but she's getting better.</i>

41:11.760 --> 41:14.638
How was she
when she arrived at the hospital?

41:15.222 --> 41:17.349
Can you tell us in detail
why she underwent surgery?

41:17.433 --> 41:18.767
<i>Who is this?</i>

41:18.851 --> 41:21.353
<i>We can't give out information about
our patients unless you're a guardian.</i>

41:21.437 --> 41:23.439
This is Judge Sim Eun-seok
from Yeonhwa District Court.

41:23.522 --> 41:27.276
You must've received an official document
asking for cooperation by now.

41:27.860 --> 41:31.447
We're about to initiate legal proceedings
for a case involving this patient.

41:31.530 --> 41:32.406
<i>One moment, please.</i>

41:33.657 --> 41:36.452
<i>Yes. We've received the document.</i>

41:36.535 --> 41:39.830
<i>She had surgery
because her femur was fractured.</i>

41:39.914 --> 41:44.835
<i>And she testified to the police that she
was assaulted by a mob of girls her age.</i>

41:45.419 --> 41:47.046
<i>That's what it says on her record.</i>

41:49.173 --> 41:51.800
I see. Thank you.

41:51.884 --> 41:53.552
Judge Sim. Let me explain.

41:54.303 --> 41:56.805
It was her. She started it.

42:03.771 --> 42:06.982
You fucking bitch.
I told you not to piss me off.

42:11.904 --> 42:12.905
Yes.

42:14.114 --> 42:17.368
You're right, Ms. O.

42:17.952 --> 42:20.287
People like you play a much bigger role

42:21.080 --> 42:22.373
than us judges

42:23.749 --> 42:25.334
who spend only two or three hours

42:26.752 --> 42:28.462
with these young offenders.

42:30.339 --> 42:32.800
We're well aware of that.

42:36.762 --> 42:38.013
But that's another story.

42:42.810 --> 42:44.019
The court subsidies.

42:44.603 --> 42:48.983
You're given 500,000 won
per child every month.

42:49.567 --> 42:50.693
Where did you spend it?

42:55.322 --> 42:57.449
These documents should tell you.

42:58.325 --> 43:00.578
Visits to museums or concerts,
play therapy,

43:01.245 --> 43:03.747
outdoor activities like field trips,
and food expenses.

43:03.831 --> 43:04.873
You charged us

43:05.833 --> 43:09.295
4,5 million more won last month,
which is much more than last year.

43:09.378 --> 43:10.337
But the children

43:11.338 --> 43:13.674
claim that they didn't take part
in such activities.

43:14.592 --> 43:17.219
And most of the documents and receipts

43:17.970 --> 43:19.346
were also missing.

43:29.898 --> 43:31.734
I was looking forward to meeting you

43:34.528 --> 43:36.363
since you have a clear set of values.

43:40.117 --> 43:41.076
I'm disappointed.

43:45.247 --> 43:47.416
I guess money does
make the world go round.

43:49.752 --> 43:52.421
I just needed it briefly.

43:52.504 --> 43:54.465
I was going to put it back. I mean it.

43:54.548 --> 43:57.426
The problem here is
that you used the money

43:59.053 --> 44:00.179
for personal use.

44:06.352 --> 44:10.272
The inspection of Pureum Home for Girls
is over now.

44:10.356 --> 44:13.108
It has disclosed details
of the group assault at the home

44:13.192 --> 44:15.110
and embezzlement

44:15.903 --> 44:18.614
that you didn't report to the court.

44:18.697 --> 44:22.910
All of these documents will be taken
for further investigation.

44:22.993 --> 44:26.205
You can expect a visit
from special investigators

44:28.207 --> 44:30.459
or a summons to appear in court.

44:33.003 --> 44:33.921
Wait…

44:35.297 --> 44:37.800
Wait a minute, please.

44:38.425 --> 44:39.385
Judge Sim.

44:42.596 --> 44:44.890
Depending on the outcome
of the investigation,

44:45.641 --> 44:48.435
the court may take steps to annul
the status of this home.

44:48.519 --> 44:50.354
Furthermore,
the court may cancel all permits

44:50.437 --> 44:52.815
and take criminal proceedings against you.

44:53.691 --> 44:54.650
Judge Sim.

44:56.527 --> 44:57.486
Wait…

45:04.034 --> 45:06.161
We have to report this
to Presiding Judge Kang, right?

45:09.289 --> 45:10.290
I'll do it tomorrow.

45:11.083 --> 45:13.669
Are you going straight home?

45:13.752 --> 45:15.504
No. To the hospital.

45:17.005 --> 45:18.048
Do Yu-gyeong.

45:18.841 --> 45:20.551
We should hear her side of the story.

45:22.344 --> 45:23.595
Okay.

45:32.271 --> 45:34.356
DO YU-GYEONG, AGE 16
DAE GYEONG HOSPITAL

45:42.656 --> 45:43.782
She used the money…

45:46.160 --> 45:47.411
for my surgery.

45:50.998 --> 45:52.541
The girls' parents

45:53.542 --> 45:55.085
refused to pay for the surgery.

45:56.420 --> 45:58.547
They said there was no evidence.

46:01.175 --> 46:02.593
And I lost contact with my mom…

46:05.179 --> 46:07.431
a long time ago when she remarried.

46:08.599 --> 46:10.517
My doctor said I wouldn't be able to walk

46:11.435 --> 46:14.188
if I didn't have surgery right away, so…

46:17.065 --> 46:21.153
It all happened because of me.
Can't you let this slide just this once?

46:22.321 --> 46:24.281
I'll work and pay back the money.

46:25.866 --> 46:27.409
While I was staying there,

46:28.410 --> 46:30.704
I had decent meals and slept comfortably

46:31.788 --> 46:33.290
for the first time in my life.

46:34.374 --> 46:38.629
I was overjoyed and grateful every day.

46:40.005 --> 46:41.632
And I realized

46:42.966 --> 46:44.510
that being loved

46:46.553 --> 46:50.766
is when someone
puts a side dish on my rice.

46:53.936 --> 46:56.313
I promised myself
that I'd live a good life.

46:57.147 --> 46:58.607
I found this new purpose

46:59.816 --> 47:01.818
because I want to
repay her for her kindness.

47:06.448 --> 47:08.492
But she shouldn't have kept it
a secret from the court.

47:08.575 --> 47:11.703
I asked her not to report it to the court.

47:12.412 --> 47:13.664
I begged her.

47:20.379 --> 47:23.757
<i>I was afraid
that I'd be kicked out of there.</i>

47:24.800 --> 47:26.760
<i>I can't go anywhere else.</i>

47:27.344 --> 47:29.763
I want to stay with Ms. O.

47:32.266 --> 47:36.728
<i>I was looking forward to meeting you
since you have a clear set of values.</i>

47:36.812 --> 47:38.188
I'm disappointed.

47:39.398 --> 47:41.567
I guess money does
make the world go round.

48:01.795 --> 48:05.507
<i>Your call could not be connected.
Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

48:05.591 --> 48:06.550
<i>Additional charges--</i>

48:06.633 --> 48:10.137
ENTRANCE

48:10.220 --> 48:11.096
Mom.

48:11.680 --> 48:13.473
-Mom.
-Kim A-jin.

48:14.850 --> 48:15.684
A-jin.

48:16.518 --> 48:18.312
-Judge Cha.
-What happened?

48:18.395 --> 48:21.857
What should I do, Judge Cha? My mom…

48:21.940 --> 48:23.191
-Let's go.
-My mom…

48:30.741 --> 48:35.704
PUREUM HOME FOR GIRLS

48:53.513 --> 48:55.557
LETTER OF APPOINTMENT

49:02.439 --> 49:03.315
Ms. O.

49:33.553 --> 49:34.721
Ms. O!

49:44.314 --> 49:46.358
Where's Ms. O?

49:47.609 --> 49:48.568
Where are the kids?

49:50.112 --> 49:51.154
Where did they all go?

49:51.780 --> 49:52.781
What happened?

49:56.368 --> 49:57.619
Kim A-reum.

49:57.703 --> 49:58.537
Mom…

49:59.830 --> 50:02.165
was taken by ambulance
to the hospital a while ago.

50:03.208 --> 50:04.501
She suddenly collapsed.

50:05.127 --> 50:06.044
What?

50:10.132 --> 50:13.135
Mom. Are you okay, Mom?

50:14.553 --> 50:17.139
What's wrong? Are you okay?

50:17.973 --> 50:20.267
Mom!

50:20.350 --> 50:22.018
Open your eyes, Mom!

50:22.102 --> 50:23.895
I thought about it.

50:24.771 --> 50:26.440
It's all because of those bitches.

50:28.275 --> 50:30.986
It was because of them
that Mom collapsed today.

50:32.154 --> 50:34.823
And it's because of them
that I don't get to see my dad.

50:36.032 --> 50:39.202
Mom said Dad can't come visit
because he was assigned overseas.

50:39.286 --> 50:43.206
But that's all a lie. They got a divorce

50:44.249 --> 50:45.292
because of this.

50:45.959 --> 50:48.754
Because of this damn care home
that Mom wouldn't give up on!

50:48.837 --> 50:50.964
Those bitches are the ones to blame.

50:53.175 --> 50:56.553
A few days ago, my sister had bad cramps,

50:56.636 --> 50:58.930
so she was taken to the emergency room.

50:59.014 --> 51:01.016
But Mom didn't come

51:01.099 --> 51:04.603
because feeding those bitches
mattered more to her than A-jin in the ER.

51:04.686 --> 51:05.687
Just…

51:07.439 --> 51:08.398
We were…

51:09.441 --> 51:13.153
We'd always come next.

51:29.711 --> 51:32.214
Shit, we were almost caught.
We could have been screwed.

51:32.297 --> 51:34.090
-I know.
-Shut the fuck up.

51:34.174 --> 51:35.050
Be quiet.

51:35.133 --> 51:36.927
Gosh, I'm afraid that we'll get caught.

51:37.010 --> 51:38.178
Shut up.

51:39.221 --> 51:40.931
Hey, go faster. It's freaking cold.

51:41.014 --> 51:41.973
Don't push me.

51:42.057 --> 51:44.476
-How far do we have to go?
-Wait, guys.

51:44.559 --> 51:48.438
So? Were you just standing there
watching them while they ran away?

51:49.189 --> 51:51.942
Were you glad that they left?

51:52.025 --> 51:53.109
No.

51:53.193 --> 51:54.277
Then?

51:54.861 --> 51:56.321
I told them to get out.

51:59.783 --> 52:00.617
What?

52:00.700 --> 52:04.120
I told them to get out of my house!

52:07.457 --> 52:08.375
Hey.

52:08.458 --> 52:09.876
-Hey!
-Hey, you fucking bitch!

52:09.960 --> 52:12.254
Hey, what the fuck!
Are you on drugs or what?

52:13.713 --> 52:15.006
What a crazy fucking bitch.

52:17.259 --> 52:18.677
-Hey!
-You fucking bitch!

52:19.261 --> 52:20.804
-Are you out of your mind?
-Stop it.

52:21.888 --> 52:23.557
-Hey!
-That's enough.

52:25.350 --> 52:26.768
Hey!

52:26.852 --> 52:28.687
Hey, do you want to follow your mom
to the hospital?

52:29.271 --> 52:30.605
Hey.

52:31.481 --> 52:32.732
You fucking bitch!

52:34.067 --> 52:35.026
Are you nuts?

52:37.863 --> 52:39.155
I'm not the one who's crazy.

52:40.240 --> 52:42.033
It's you.

52:43.451 --> 52:44.870
Get lost!

52:46.496 --> 52:48.206
Hey, stop her!

52:49.207 --> 52:51.001
Hey, you crazy fucking bitch!

52:52.294 --> 52:55.088
-Let go of her!
-Let go!

52:55.839 --> 52:58.216
-Hey!
-Get the fuck off!

52:58.300 --> 53:00.427
Get her off me, fuck!

53:01.595 --> 53:03.972
-Are you okay, Yeong-na?
-Yeong-na.

53:04.055 --> 53:05.599
-Are you okay?
-She must be crazy.

53:05.682 --> 53:08.143
That bitch is crazy.
What's wrong with her?

53:08.226 --> 53:10.645
-What's she doing?
-What the fuck is she trying to do?

53:10.729 --> 53:11.897
Seriously, what the fuck.

53:13.023 --> 53:15.317
Get out!

53:19.321 --> 53:20.906
It's all over now.

53:23.575 --> 53:24.701
Both this home

53:25.827 --> 53:26.912
and those bitches.

53:30.081 --> 53:31.249
It's all over.

53:44.846 --> 53:46.222
Mom.

53:46.723 --> 53:47.557
Judge Cha.

53:47.641 --> 53:51.311
Are you okay now?

53:52.479 --> 53:54.940
Doctor. The patient
regained consciousness.

53:55.023 --> 53:56.274
All right.

53:56.358 --> 53:58.401
Yeon-ji. Wait for us.

53:58.485 --> 53:59.861
Come on.

53:59.945 --> 54:01.446
Gosh, what is this place?

54:01.529 --> 54:02.989
-Hey. Are you okay?
-Darn it.

54:04.699 --> 54:05.742
What's wrong?

54:05.825 --> 54:08.787
Are you okay? You should've been careful.

54:13.041 --> 54:15.377
Let's go back. We can't walk there.

54:16.127 --> 54:18.088
It'll be another hour
to the train station.

54:18.171 --> 54:20.423
And if we do? I guess that bitch
will welcome us with open arms.

54:20.507 --> 54:23.259
If you don't want to go then get lost,
you fucking bitch.

54:23.343 --> 54:24.427
I'll go by myself.

54:26.096 --> 54:27.722
-Hey, get up.
-Come on, get up.

54:29.599 --> 54:30.642
Be careful.

54:31.643 --> 54:34.354
-I can't walk anymore!
-Hey, hold on.

54:37.524 --> 54:39.526
Hey. You have some money, right?

54:40.860 --> 54:41.778
Hand it over.

54:43.905 --> 54:45.031
I said, hand it over.

54:49.995 --> 54:52.789
JUDGE CHA TAE-JU

54:56.209 --> 54:58.670
Well…

54:59.629 --> 55:01.339
I think it's been about three hours.

55:01.423 --> 55:02.841
No.

55:03.591 --> 55:06.720
We came here for an inspection,
when someone reported--

55:17.856 --> 55:18.898
Just a second, please.

55:21.818 --> 55:23.361
I'll call you back.

55:44.174 --> 55:45.133
It was you.

56:06.613 --> 56:07.697
SIM EUN-SEOK

56:07.781 --> 56:09.824
UNIT 302, DONGGUK VILLAGE
54 YEONHWA-RO 9-GIL

56:27.801 --> 56:28.843
Yes, I found it.

56:31.679 --> 56:33.139
But I seem to have missed her.

56:55.286 --> 56:56.412
The person…

56:58.665 --> 57:00.792
who wants this home to be shut down.

57:02.961 --> 57:04.587
The one who made the report…

57:08.174 --> 57:09.092
was you.

58:23.833 --> 58:27.253
THE CHARACTERS AND EVENTS DEPICTED
IN THE SHOW ARE FICTITIOUS
