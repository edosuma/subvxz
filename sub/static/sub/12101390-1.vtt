00:58.606 --> 00:59.442
Jim?

01:02.578 --> 01:03.446
Jim?

01:06.448 --> 01:07.316
Jim!

01:13.789 --> 01:16.058
What did you party too hard?

01:23.465 --> 01:24.333
Oh!

01:25.233 --> 01:26.468
What is that?

01:31.906 --> 01:34.942
Make it stop.

01:40.816 --> 01:42.183
Ma?

03:01.663 --> 03:03.965
Dude, just make an
appointment already.

03:04.032 --> 03:06.601
No, no, no, no.

03:06.669 --> 03:08.537
Why the fuck you gotta
make it such a big thing?

03:08.604 --> 03:09.739
Seriously.

03:10.939 --> 03:14.909
I just, I just,
needles, I don't like 'em.

03:14.977 --> 03:19.548
Okay so like tattoos,
piercings also out of the question?

03:19.615 --> 03:20.883
Hmm?, Square Boy?

03:20.949 --> 03:22.150
Yeah. Not happening.

03:23.686 --> 03:24.687
Why?

03:24.753 --> 03:26.655
Are you a little
conformist?

03:26.722 --> 03:29.191
Wow. Hey, Alyson.

03:29.258 --> 03:31.126
My body is a temple.

03:31.193 --> 03:33.929
Oh, are you saying
my body's not a temple?

03:33.996 --> 03:34.897
And be.

03:36.799 --> 03:39.067
It's not just the needles, okay?

03:39.133 --> 03:42.169
I have a thing with blood,
especially my blood.

03:42.236 --> 03:43.938
- Dude.
- Jim.

03:44.006 --> 03:44.939
No big fucking deal.

03:45.007 --> 03:46.775
You just look away.

03:46.842 --> 03:48.143
- You don't gotta watch.
- Mm-hmm.

03:48.210 --> 03:49.745
Nah.

03:49.812 --> 03:52.080
I get all like
woozy and shit too

03:52.146 --> 03:53.948
from all the blood loss.

03:54.015 --> 03:55.816
- No dude.
- No, yeah.

03:55.883 --> 03:58.185
That's why they give
you the cookies.

03:58.252 --> 04:00.856
I saw that on episode
of "The Simpsons."

04:01.723 --> 04:03.959
Jim, just some advice,

04:04.026 --> 04:07.695
maybe don't use "The Simpsons"
as a rough guide to life.

04:10.032 --> 04:12.168
Exactly. Girl's on point.

04:14.402 --> 04:15.336
Whatever, y'all.

04:15.403 --> 04:17.173
There are other
ways to make money.

04:18.774 --> 04:20.341
Oh my God.

04:20.408 --> 04:22.043
Lots of, I'm thinking.

04:22.978 --> 04:24.913
Yeah. Okay.

04:24.980 --> 04:26.715
You go get that bag, player.

04:26.781 --> 04:27.716
I'm gonna roll another joint.

04:27.783 --> 04:30.019
Ooh, look at this.

04:31.120 --> 04:32.620
House sitting.

04:32.687 --> 04:34.255
House sitting?

04:34.322 --> 04:38.193
Yeah. Looks like
pretty nice place.

04:39.728 --> 04:42.331
Looks like a job for
a 12 year old girl.

04:42.398 --> 04:43.299
How much does it pay?

04:44.932 --> 04:48.135
Um, wow. A hundred
bucks a night.

04:48.202 --> 04:49.303
Ooh, wow.

04:49.370 --> 04:51.673
Plasma donors get 80
bucks a donation, dude.

04:51.740 --> 04:53.910
And it's like a couple hours.

04:55.911 --> 04:57.245
It's some old lady's place.

04:58.880 --> 05:00.115
It's pretty close to here.

05:01.949 --> 05:03.286
Do you think I
should email them?

05:04.353 --> 05:05.853
Where are my goddamn papers?

05:06.788 --> 05:07.990
Hmm.

05:08.057 --> 05:09.358
What do you think?

05:09.425 --> 05:13.028
It could be cool. Easy way
to make some cash, I guess.

05:13.095 --> 05:14.630
So should I hit 'em up?

05:14.697 --> 05:15.798
Sure, dude.

05:15.865 --> 05:18.033
Maybe you could party
somewhere else for once.

05:18.100 --> 05:20.670
Jesus-goddamn-
motherfucking-Christ.

05:22.004 --> 05:24.173
I gotta have some in the car.

05:30.846 --> 05:35.417
Hmm.

05:35.483 --> 05:36.651
- What?
- Nothing.

05:37.685 --> 05:40.322
It's just cute that
you're squeamish.

05:40.389 --> 05:44.192
And just don't like the
idea of losing pints of blood.

05:44.259 --> 05:47.129
Oh my
God. It's not pints.

05:51.500 --> 05:52.601
You're so funny.

05:57.906 --> 06:00.643
You better write that email
before someone else gets on it.

06:02.110 --> 06:02.978
Yeah.

06:08.951 --> 06:11.218
All right, baby.

06:11.286 --> 06:12.754
Now we're cooking with gas.

06:18.826 --> 06:19.995
- Dude, oh my God.
- What?

06:20.062 --> 06:20.762
- It doesn't matter.
- You're dropping everything.

06:20.829 --> 06:22.430
- Shut up.
- Stop.

06:22.497 --> 06:23.699
- Shut up.
- What?

06:23.766 --> 06:24.634
Chill.

06:35.444 --> 06:38.914
The doors are
closing as the train departs.

06:38.980 --> 06:40.081
Please hold on.

07:33.235 --> 07:35.069
Probably need you
a couple of nights,

07:35.137 --> 07:37.172
coming back Sunday,
maybe Monday, latest.

07:37.238 --> 07:39.440
Just kind of depends
how she's doing.

07:39.507 --> 07:40.375
Right, Ma?

07:41.910 --> 07:42.978
Christ.

07:43.978 --> 07:45.146
So yeah.

07:45.213 --> 07:46.481
Just need you to stay here.

07:47.548 --> 07:49.450
Ma's a little paranoid
about prowlers.

07:49.517 --> 07:51.219
I've heard plenty.

07:53.254 --> 07:55.156
You got any questions?

07:55.223 --> 07:57.558
Um, yeah.

07:57.625 --> 08:01.229
So basically you just
want me to stay here?

08:02.163 --> 08:04.064
He doesn't have to stay here.

08:04.132 --> 08:06.334
He doesn't want to.

08:06.401 --> 08:07.470
Yes.

08:09.237 --> 08:11.906
There's a guest room upstairs.
Used to be mom's room.

08:11.973 --> 08:13.808
Have it set up by Friday.

08:13.875 --> 08:15.176
Cool.

08:15.244 --> 08:16.479
That gonna work for ya?

08:16.545 --> 08:20.282
He doesn't have to stay
here if he doesn't want to.

08:20.348 --> 08:24.485
Ma, I am doing what I
can to ease your mind here.

08:24.552 --> 08:27.088
You are not making it easy.

08:27.154 --> 08:30.158
My own son yelling
at his mother.

08:31.293 --> 08:32.927
You're good to your
mother, aren't you?

08:32.995 --> 08:36.932
That's the whole point, Ma.

08:36.999 --> 08:39.134
That he stay here.

08:40.568 --> 08:45.240
I just wish the good
Lord would take me now.

08:49.278 --> 08:50.146
Ma.

08:51.245 --> 08:53.215
Ma, where are you going?

08:53.282 --> 08:56.786
Can I even take a piss
without you hounding me?

09:01.690 --> 09:02.558
Hmm.

09:06.193 --> 09:08.462
Her health hasn't been good.

09:08.529 --> 09:12.367
My sister was watching
her for a while, eh.

09:14.469 --> 09:16.538
Well we think she
took off last week.

09:16.605 --> 09:19.374
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:19.441 --> 09:20.975
That sucks.

09:21.043 --> 09:22.443
Yeah.

09:22.510 --> 09:24.379
I can't say I blame her.

09:24.446 --> 09:27.449
She's been going on about
people in the house,

09:28.582 --> 09:29.683
coming up the stairs.

09:29.750 --> 09:30.451
You know, I don't know
if her head's right.

09:30.518 --> 09:32.955
- You know?
- Right.

09:34.022 --> 09:36.591
So...

09:36.658 --> 09:41.296
So, you know,
should be pretty easy.

09:41.363 --> 09:43.098
Nothing, you know, you gotta do.

09:43.164 --> 09:46.033
Just, you know, if you get bored

09:46.100 --> 09:48.302
and you wanna have some
friends over keep you company,

09:48.370 --> 09:50.272
- feel free.
- Okay.

09:50.339 --> 09:52.307
- Cool.
- Just no smoking.

09:52.374 --> 09:53.475
- All right?
- Oh, yeah, no.

09:53.542 --> 09:55.677
- No drugs.
- No, of course.

09:55.744 --> 09:57.545
- You a weed smoker?
- Me?

09:57.611 --> 09:59.413
No, no, not at all.

09:59.480 --> 10:01.850
Good. Shit makes you lazy.

10:03.118 --> 10:04.987
- Yeah.
- And stupid.

10:06.654 --> 10:09.189
You know I don't
like you smoking.

10:09.256 --> 10:11.259
I know, Ma.

10:12.995 --> 10:13.863
Oh, boy.

10:17.532 --> 10:18.566
So what do you say, kid?

10:18.633 --> 10:20.235
Are you gonna watch
this old bird's house

10:20.302 --> 10:21.369
for the weekend or what?

10:21.436 --> 10:24.639
Yeah, I mean, sure.

10:24.706 --> 10:26.274
Great. Settled.

10:27.142 --> 10:28.944
See it all worked out.

10:29.010 --> 10:32.613
Mm, I think if that's it,

10:32.681 --> 10:35.951
I'm just gonna call a ride or

10:36.018 --> 10:37.218
- No, I can drop you
- something.

10:37.284 --> 10:38.719
somewhere in town
on my way back.

10:38.787 --> 10:41.256
Oh, you don't have to do that.

10:41.322 --> 10:42.156
Yeah, no, I insist.

10:42.224 --> 10:43.658
Just give me a sec.

11:04.546 --> 11:08.350
I'm not as senile as
he makes me out to be.

11:09.683 --> 11:14.689
And I'm not afraid of someone
breaking into the house,

11:15.823 --> 11:18.326
I'm afraid of what's
already in the house.

11:19.561 --> 11:22.629
- Mrs. Marina.
- And if you stay here,

11:22.697 --> 11:24.231
you'll hear it too.

11:33.375 --> 11:35.043
Yo, Auntie E, what's shaking?

11:42.384 --> 11:44.284
Yo, y'all got anything
good to eat in here?

11:44.351 --> 11:45.353
I'm starving.

11:48.590 --> 11:51.225
Hey man, I didn't see you there.

11:51.293 --> 11:52.693
Kinda quiet.

11:52.760 --> 11:54.295
Yeah, sorry.

11:56.130 --> 11:56.966
Lost in thought.

11:57.832 --> 12:00.769
My grandnephew, Alex.

12:00.836 --> 12:02.504
That's me. Your boy.

12:02.571 --> 12:04.305
Say, I'll tell you what, man,

12:04.371 --> 12:06.073
you must be that guy
they got watching,

12:06.140 --> 12:07.474
watching the house for
the weekend there, huh?

12:07.542 --> 12:09.577
Uh, yeah. I guess I am.

12:10.644 --> 12:12.079
Yeah, they couldn't
get me to do it.

12:12.147 --> 12:13.148
Why?

12:13.215 --> 12:15.149
What's wrong with
this place, dude?

12:15.216 --> 12:16.784
Dude, it's fine.
Nothing's wrong.

12:16.851 --> 12:19.053
It's, I'm just going away
with the boys to Vegas

12:19.120 --> 12:20.054
for the weekend, that's all.

12:20.121 --> 12:20.990
- Chill.
- Oh.

12:22.756 --> 12:23.757
Oh, right.

12:23.825 --> 12:26.360
Oh, before I forget,
Hey Auntie Eunie.

12:26.427 --> 12:30.131
You're good with that, that
thing we talked about, right?

12:31.866 --> 12:34.402
Everything all
good with what thing?

12:36.437 --> 12:37.306
Well?

12:39.640 --> 12:42.543
What's this thing?

12:42.610 --> 12:44.346
Mm, nothing really.

12:46.480 --> 12:48.316
Shit, Uncle Tony,
it's been a minute.

12:48.383 --> 12:49.451
You're looking pretty
smooth though, man.

12:49.517 --> 12:52.121
You put on what like
50 pounds or something?

12:52.888 --> 12:55.389
Why are you here, shit stain?

12:55.456 --> 12:56.724
'Cause I wanted to
come by and say hey

12:56.791 --> 12:57.725
to my favorite relatives.

12:57.792 --> 12:59.860
That's fucking
why. Come on, man.

12:59.927 --> 13:01.495
So you can raid our fridge

13:01.562 --> 13:03.497
and be a general
freaking nuisance?

13:03.565 --> 13:04.800
Is that why?

13:04.865 --> 13:07.168
Well there's nothing like
some quality family time

13:07.235 --> 13:09.370
but I gotta get going, so...

13:09.437 --> 13:11.505
Yeah, you can say that again.

13:11.572 --> 13:13.241
Catch you later, guys.

13:15.210 --> 13:16.744
Sorry about that.

13:16.811 --> 13:17.679
You ready to go?

13:18.746 --> 13:21.216
Yeah, no worries.

13:21.917 --> 13:23.384
Cool. Let's hit it.

13:30.192 --> 13:32.826
Man, that is some
spooky shit, bro.

13:32.894 --> 13:34.796
- I know, right?
- I don't think I'd do it.

13:36.464 --> 13:40.169
Mm, yeah, I already
told them I would, so.

13:41.403 --> 13:44.272
Well take Grandma's advice,

13:44.339 --> 13:46.608
"Stay home, fake it.

13:46.674 --> 13:47.543
Easy money."

13:49.744 --> 13:53.581
Is it weird that I
kind of just wanna see

13:53.648 --> 13:55.450
what she's talking about?

13:55.517 --> 13:57.152
Yeah, it is.

13:57.219 --> 14:00.322
Well like she's
gotta be senile, right?

14:01.222 --> 14:02.223
I don't know, man.

14:05.226 --> 14:06.560
Here.

14:06.628 --> 14:07.496
Thank you.

14:09.331 --> 14:11.832
Like what's the worst
that could happen?

14:14.469 --> 14:16.205
You get butt
fucked by a demon.

14:17.538 --> 14:21.208
Like seriously, that scene
out of "Deliverance."

14:21.275 --> 14:22.443
That's you.

14:22.510 --> 14:26.213
A literal hell spawn
comes up out of the floor

14:26.280 --> 14:29.783
and drags you to a
fiery pit of agony

14:29.850 --> 14:31.285
for all eternity.

14:32.620 --> 14:35.557
Or you know, you get shot
in the face by a prowler.

14:35.624 --> 14:36.291
Mm.

14:38.393 --> 14:39.827
I'm too high for shit shit.

14:41.495 --> 14:42.930
Serious, bro.

14:45.799 --> 14:47.434
I'm serious.

14:47.501 --> 14:49.469
You should bail.

14:49.537 --> 14:50.405
I can't.

14:51.572 --> 14:53.975
There's better ways to
get that cheddar, dog.

14:54.042 --> 14:54.910
I...

14:58.312 --> 15:00.414
When I say I'm gonna do
something, I'm gonna do it.

15:00.481 --> 15:02.649
Come hell or high water, so.

15:02.716 --> 15:04.819
Your funeral.

15:05.886 --> 15:06.754
Here.

15:09.691 --> 15:10.825
I don't think it'll be that bad.

15:10.892 --> 15:14.562
I mean, it's pretty big
place to have to myself.

15:14.629 --> 15:16.697
You and Alyson oughta
come by one night.

15:16.764 --> 15:19.234
Yeah, probably swing that.

15:19.301 --> 15:20.568
Protect you from that old girl.

15:20.634 --> 15:21.702
Oh my God!

15:23.071 --> 15:25.473
Wine me, dine me, 69 me.

15:25.539 --> 15:28.375
Take a look at that.

15:28.442 --> 15:29.311
Nice.

15:30.077 --> 15:31.379
Yup.

15:31.446 --> 15:33.248
I thank the good Lord every
day that I was born handsome

15:33.315 --> 15:34.349
and not rich.

15:35.682 --> 15:38.485
You think she'd be okay
with you showing me that?

15:38.552 --> 15:40.020
She wouldn't care.

15:40.087 --> 15:41.288
Really?

15:41.355 --> 15:43.691
'Cause a lot of girls
would call you an asshole.

15:43.758 --> 15:46.527
Well, Alyson ain't most girls.

15:46.594 --> 15:48.596
Besides, I don't give two shits

15:48.663 --> 15:51.500
what any dumb fuck
thinks about me, brother.

15:53.000 --> 15:53.869
Okay.

15:55.003 --> 15:56.638
What time is it?

15:56.705 --> 15:57.705
I don't know.

16:02.543 --> 16:04.278
Wanna roll another?

16:04.346 --> 16:05.746
What are you, the mentalist?

16:07.081 --> 16:11.452
Yeah and your
future looks stoned.

16:14.822 --> 16:15.691
Yeah, it does.

16:18.525 --> 16:19.460
Where's my papers?

16:25.767 --> 16:27.669
All right, you ready to go?

16:27.735 --> 16:29.971
I never was.

16:30.038 --> 16:31.773
That's the spirit.

16:32.907 --> 16:34.509
Hey, thanks again
for doing this, huh.

16:34.576 --> 16:35.644
Yeah, no sweat.

16:37.912 --> 16:39.381
All right, Ma. Let's go.

16:40.648 --> 16:41.550
Drive safe.

16:44.785 --> 16:45.719
Okay.

18:10.571 --> 18:11.439
Jim?

18:13.474 --> 18:14.342
Hello?

18:16.211 --> 18:17.577
Hey, Dad.

18:17.644 --> 18:19.146
Oh, there you are.

18:19.213 --> 18:21.448
Hey, is everything okay?

18:21.516 --> 18:22.384
Jim?

18:25.118 --> 18:25.986
Yeah.

18:27.154 --> 18:28.855
I'm, I'm good.

18:28.923 --> 18:29.790
I just

18:33.126 --> 18:36.630
wanted to call and
see how you were doing

18:39.666 --> 18:41.769
Well, everything's fine.

18:41.836 --> 18:44.105
So how are you
liking it up there?

18:44.172 --> 18:45.039
It's nice.

18:45.940 --> 18:46.774
Pretty.

18:50.612 --> 18:51.480
How's Caitlin?

18:52.145 --> 18:53.580
She's well.

18:53.647 --> 18:55.615
Back in school now.

18:55.682 --> 18:56.951
She seems to be adjusting.

18:58.252 --> 18:59.453
Okay.

18:59.520 --> 19:02.123
Hey look, I'm really sorry
that I haven't called.

19:02.190 --> 19:02.856
It's just

19:05.859 --> 19:07.661
I've looking for work and

19:11.132 --> 19:13.000
with everything that
happened, I just...

19:13.067 --> 19:14.734
It's okay, Jim

19:14.801 --> 19:16.771
We don't have to
rehash this right now.

19:17.939 --> 19:19.707
So, work?

19:19.773 --> 19:20.641
Yeah.

19:21.709 --> 19:23.144
I'm kind of house
sitting right now.

19:23.211 --> 19:25.180
I found it off a website.

19:26.713 --> 19:30.050
It's pretty good money.

19:30.117 --> 19:30.951
I see.

19:32.953 --> 19:35.156
Well that sounds like something.

19:38.726 --> 19:39.561
Yeah.

19:42.931 --> 19:43.999
Hey, um.

19:46.099 --> 19:48.935
I was wondering if
you'd be willing

19:49.002 --> 19:52.205
to send me a little money?

19:52.272 --> 19:55.009
Just until my next paycheck.

19:55.076 --> 19:56.243
Okay.

19:56.310 --> 19:57.745
When's your next paycheck?

19:58.645 --> 19:59.513
Um...

20:02.349 --> 20:04.019
I guess I don't actually know.

20:05.019 --> 20:06.220
But I'll pay you back.

20:06.287 --> 20:07.989
You don't have to pay me back.

20:09.190 --> 20:10.659
But you can do me a favor.

20:11.858 --> 20:12.726
Okay.

20:13.760 --> 20:15.896
Call your sister
once in a while.

20:15.963 --> 20:17.031
She really misses you.

20:18.967 --> 20:20.535
I know.

20:20.602 --> 20:21.470
I will.

20:23.003 --> 20:24.805
I love you, son. We love you.

20:27.008 --> 20:27.875
I...

20:35.148 --> 20:37.584
Okay, the money should
be in your account now.

20:37.652 --> 20:38.419
Thanks.

20:38.486 --> 20:41.156
I'll, I'll talk to you soon.

20:42.155 --> 20:46.760
And say hi to Kim for me.

20:46.827 --> 20:47.662
I will.

20:48.663 --> 20:49.498
Okay.

20:52.666 --> 20:53.567
Bye, son.

20:56.304 --> 20:57.171
Bye.

21:12.185 --> 21:14.355
Thank you for
calling Galactic Pizza.

21:14.422 --> 21:17.791
Can I interest you in
some of our Saturn bread?

21:17.858 --> 21:19.859
Um, no, thank you. Not today.

21:21.261 --> 21:23.831
All right, what can
I get started for you, sir?

21:25.032 --> 21:30.038
Can I get a medium
galactic meat lovers...

21:31.405 --> 21:34.307
The intergalactic
meat lovers pizza?

21:34.375 --> 21:36.676
Yeah, intergalactic
meat lovers pizza.

21:36.743 --> 21:38.378
Okay, I've got one large

21:38.445 --> 21:40.113
intergalactic meat lovers pizza.

21:40.181 --> 21:41.182
Is that gonna be
everything for you?

21:41.249 --> 21:42.083
Yep.

21:44.852 --> 21:48.055
So is that gonna
be cash, debit or credit?

21:49.691 --> 21:51.092
Sir? Hello?

22:27.228 --> 22:28.096
Oh.

25:15.395 --> 25:17.330
Mom, do you want any
sour cream in your eggs?

25:22.303 --> 25:23.171
Mom?

25:24.238 --> 25:25.840
- Mom?
- Uh-huh.

25:26.941 --> 25:28.342
Hi.

25:28.409 --> 25:30.511
Would you like some
sour cream in your eggs?

25:30.577 --> 25:31.878
Oh, yeah

25:31.945 --> 25:33.147
Yeah, sure, honey.

25:34.582 --> 25:35.917
Are you doing okay?

25:37.451 --> 25:39.420
Oh, I think I'm just tired.

25:39.487 --> 25:42.023
I didn't sleep so
good last night.

25:42.957 --> 25:44.392
You seem a little off.

25:45.526 --> 25:47.461
Well I've been
having nightmares.

25:47.528 --> 25:48.596
Nightmares, huh?

25:48.662 --> 25:52.333
Yeah, it's the same
thing over and over.

25:54.468 --> 25:56.171
It's so strange.

25:58.138 --> 26:01.107
I'm awoken every night
by someone walking

26:01.174 --> 26:03.110
slowly up the stairs.

26:04.444 --> 26:06.079
And the footsteps are so strong,

26:06.146 --> 26:09.215
they vibrate the
walls of my room.

26:09.282 --> 26:10.284
And I get out of bed

26:11.519 --> 26:13.420
and I go over to the
banister and I look over,

26:13.487 --> 26:18.493
and there's this thing
walking slowly up the stairs.

26:19.593 --> 26:23.197
And I run back to my
room and shut the door.

26:24.365 --> 26:26.300
And then I wake up.

26:28.035 --> 26:30.504
Hmm. You wonder
what that's about.

26:30.570 --> 26:31.605
What do you mean?

26:31.672 --> 26:34.040
Well, dreams are
kind of like an insight

26:34.107 --> 26:36.609
into your subconscious, right?

26:36.676 --> 26:39.946
It could be something that
you're not dealing with.

26:40.013 --> 26:43.517
Like stress, anxiety,
I mean, resentment.

26:45.019 --> 26:46.220
- Resent what?
- Mom, I don't know.

26:46.287 --> 26:47.288
They're your dreams.

26:47.355 --> 26:49.656
I'm just saying that
sometimes dreams

26:49.723 --> 26:53.394
can be like a
metaphor for things

26:53.461 --> 26:54.627
you're not dealing with.

26:54.694 --> 26:56.230
Oh, for God sake.

26:56.297 --> 26:57.265
Does everything have to be

26:57.330 --> 27:00.333
a psychological
disorder these days?

27:00.401 --> 27:02.369
They're just fears.

27:02.435 --> 27:04.872
I had them since I
was a little girl.

27:06.673 --> 27:08.509
Mom, I don't know.

27:09.609 --> 27:11.544
Maybe it's something
you're not dealing with.

27:11.612 --> 27:15.316
Donna, I'm
nearly a 70 year old woman.

27:15.383 --> 27:16.584
I live alone.

27:17.884 --> 27:20.487
I'm afraid, I'm afraid
something's gonna happen to me,

27:20.554 --> 27:22.523
and I won't be able
to protect myself.

27:22.589 --> 27:23.256
Oh, Mom.

27:24.692 --> 27:26.460
I'm right down the street.

27:26.527 --> 27:30.030
You can call me at any time
and I'll be right over.

27:32.066 --> 27:33.334
Oh.

27:33.401 --> 27:36.202
Mom, I love you.

27:36.269 --> 27:38.306
I love you too, sweet pea.

29:11.397 --> 29:13.134
- She cries.
- Cries?

29:15.402 --> 29:16.403
In the night.

29:16.470 --> 29:17.604
Dead people don't cry.

32:52.086 --> 32:54.255
Mm. Hey, hey.

32:55.622 --> 32:58.558
You and Alyson wanna drop by
the old lady's house tonight?

33:03.063 --> 33:05.365
And you know,
the Hunchback Nostradamus,

33:05.432 --> 33:07.067
- he predicted it.
- No, it was

33:07.134 --> 33:09.736
- just Nostradamus.
- That's what I said.

33:09.803 --> 33:11.905
No, it was not a hunchback.

33:11.971 --> 33:12.940
That guy's from Notre Dame.

33:13.006 --> 33:13.941
I saw it on the
History Channel.

33:14.007 --> 33:17.311
I know. We
watched it together.

33:17.377 --> 33:18.311
He wasn't a hunchback?

33:18.378 --> 33:19.045
No.

33:20.713 --> 33:22.982
- Nostradamus.
- Yeah.

33:23.049 --> 33:25.484
- Predicted 9/11.
- Yes.

33:25.551 --> 33:27.721
It's a historical fact, bro.

33:27.788 --> 33:28.755
Is it?

33:28.821 --> 33:30.189
Is it a historical fact.

33:30.257 --> 33:32.592
Yeah. He predicted all sorts
of things that came to pass,

33:32.659 --> 33:37.097
like World War II, the rise
and fall of the Roman Empire,

33:37.163 --> 33:39.066
the Kennedy assassination.

33:39.133 --> 33:41.601
And he was the
one who figured out

33:41.667 --> 33:43.803
that Count Dracula
was into dudes.

33:46.973 --> 33:47.874
Dudes.

33:47.941 --> 33:50.644
Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.

33:50.711 --> 33:52.846
"I vant to suck your cock."

33:56.682 --> 34:00.787
Wasn't Nostradamus
just like some old dude

34:00.854 --> 34:03.090
from Shakespeare times?

34:03.156 --> 34:04.891
How could he have predicted

34:05.792 --> 34:07.760
an assassination of a president

34:07.827 --> 34:10.831
who wasn't a president yet

34:10.898 --> 34:14.501
in a country that
wasn't a country yet.

34:14.568 --> 34:18.038
That old dude was
an oracle genius, bro.

34:18.105 --> 34:19.072
Look. All right.

34:19.139 --> 34:21.375
This is what he
predicted about 9/11.

34:22.509 --> 34:24.911
"Volcanic fire from
the center of the earth

34:24.978 --> 34:28.481
will cause trembling
around the new city.

34:28.547 --> 34:31.817
Two great rocks will
make war for a long time.

34:31.885 --> 34:35.789
In the year 1999 in the
seventh month from the sky

34:35.856 --> 34:38.091
will come the great
king of terror,

34:38.157 --> 34:41.161
bringing back to life the
great king of the Mongols

34:41.228 --> 34:45.333
before and after it
reigned by good fortune.

34:47.768 --> 34:48.635
Okay.

34:50.070 --> 34:52.773
9/11 was in 2001.

34:54.074 --> 34:55.076
Oh my God.

34:58.878 --> 34:59.746
September.

35:00.847 --> 35:02.416
It's the ninth month.

35:02.483 --> 35:07.488
Not the seventh, you know, 9/11.

35:07.954 --> 35:09.023
Fuck you, bro.

35:13.860 --> 35:15.060
Bush wasn't a King.

35:15.128 --> 35:16.563
You don't know.

35:16.630 --> 35:18.465
And he damn sure
wasn't mongolian.

35:18.532 --> 35:19.298
Well, you know what?

35:19.365 --> 35:21.134
I'm gonna tell you something.

35:21.201 --> 35:25.771
Can you get me out of here.

35:25.838 --> 35:30.844
Why do you
gotta ruin everything?

35:32.246 --> 35:36.182
People just, they get on
my nerves with this whole

35:36.250 --> 35:38.985
- ignorant thing.
- Okay, damn.

35:39.052 --> 35:40.921
What are you like
the no fun police?

35:43.056 --> 35:45.458
Where's you sense
of imagination?

35:45.525 --> 35:49.797
I don't have a problem
imagining just believing.

35:51.130 --> 35:52.766
Isn't it more fun to believe?

35:54.967 --> 35:56.569
I mean, I guess.

35:56.637 --> 36:00.539
But in my experience,

36:00.606 --> 36:02.809
the logical answer's
usually correct

36:05.311 --> 36:07.547
You wanna go outside
and smoke a joint?

36:08.548 --> 36:09.416
Yeah.

36:10.251 --> 36:12.953
Wait, I need another beer.

36:13.019 --> 36:14.054
Really?

36:14.121 --> 36:16.690
That doesn't drive
me to drink already?

36:16.757 --> 36:18.659
I am an independent
woman, Jim.

36:19.559 --> 36:20.693
I can drive myself.

36:20.760 --> 36:21.894
Okay.

36:40.347 --> 36:42.182
Whoa. That much?

36:42.248 --> 36:45.184
Slow down, Cheech
and Chong.

36:45.251 --> 36:46.586
What?

36:46.652 --> 36:51.257
Roll a mountain bike, no a
road bike, you fucking waste.

36:51.324 --> 36:54.159
You know, that mouth of yours

36:54.226 --> 36:56.795
could give the wrong impression.

36:56.862 --> 36:59.065
Mama said that might happen.

37:11.378 --> 37:13.146
- You ever shotgun?
- No.

37:14.880 --> 37:16.949
Do you know what that is?

37:17.016 --> 37:18.684
Yeah, I saw it on
a documentary once

37:18.751 --> 37:20.820
on some like Vietnam thing.

37:20.887 --> 37:23.257
A documentary?

37:24.791 --> 37:28.827
Yeah, I mean one guy has
a shotgun and he blows smoke

37:28.894 --> 37:31.097
through it to another guy.

37:31.164 --> 37:32.566
Is that why they call it that?

37:32.632 --> 37:35.034
- Hmm.
- I mean, I guess.

37:35.101 --> 37:37.636
Well I've never
done that either.

37:37.704 --> 37:38.505
Come here.

37:54.688 --> 37:55.523
Sorry.

37:58.992 --> 37:59.860
For what?

38:02.963 --> 38:05.131
He's right there.

38:05.197 --> 38:09.335
What,
guy code telling you

38:09.402 --> 38:11.638
it's not okay to fuck
your friend's girl?

38:13.773 --> 38:14.909
He's right there.

38:20.914 --> 38:22.316
You're right. Sorry.

38:24.918 --> 38:26.753
- Are you mad?
- No.

38:26.820 --> 38:28.755
I just think it's about
time that I go wake up

38:28.822 --> 38:30.390
my drunk-ass boyfriend
so I can take him home

38:30.456 --> 38:31.824
and fuck his brains out.

38:53.346 --> 38:54.347
Come on.

38:54.414 --> 38:55.682
- Baby, I'm tired.
- Mm-hmm.

38:55.748 --> 38:57.083
- Let's go.
- Mm.

38:59.719 --> 39:00.587
Okay.

39:01.887 --> 39:02.722
Ready?

39:03.856 --> 39:04.523
Okay.

39:06.259 --> 39:08.427
I guess we're heading out.

39:08.494 --> 39:09.728
Catch you on the
flippity-flop, Jimbo.

39:09.795 --> 39:10.797
All right, let's go.

39:25.144 --> 39:28.282
What the fuck did
I get myself into?

41:58.364 --> 41:59.198
Mrs. Marina?

42:02.902 --> 42:05.105
I didn't realize you were home.

42:16.382 --> 42:20.019
So is Tony outside, or...

42:22.922 --> 42:24.857
My phone must be on silent.

42:37.704 --> 42:38.906
Mrs. Marina?

42:42.976 --> 42:44.309
Is everything okay?

43:18.510 --> 43:21.480
I went to be at
10:30 last night.

43:24.016 --> 43:26.385
But I didn't really sleep.

44:19.706 --> 44:20.574
Holy shit.

44:31.217 --> 44:32.684
You gotta be kidding me.

44:36.155 --> 44:37.023
Wake up.

44:38.724 --> 44:40.460
Wake up, wake up, wake
up, wake up, wake up,

44:40.527 --> 44:45.065
wake up, wake up, wake up,
wake up, wake up, wake up.

45:11.724 --> 45:14.559
Jesus Christ, this
is dated from June.

45:14.626 --> 45:17.130
Aren't you're supposed to
be taken care of the mail?

45:17.197 --> 45:18.297
I bring in.

45:18.364 --> 45:20.166
I don't go through it.

45:20.233 --> 45:21.468
What do you care anyways?

45:22.402 --> 45:23.369
Okay. God.

45:23.436 --> 45:25.038
Sorry for trying to help.

45:26.139 --> 45:27.374
Oh, is that what you're doing?

45:27.440 --> 45:30.043
It really just seems like
you're busting my balls.

45:30.110 --> 45:31.577
I'm just saying, Don.

45:31.643 --> 45:34.479
She needs a little
more help these days.

45:34.547 --> 45:35.481
Oh really?

45:35.547 --> 45:36.581
Last time I checked,

45:36.648 --> 45:38.583
I'm the only one
that's here every day.

45:38.650 --> 45:40.318
That is bullshit, Donna.

45:40.385 --> 45:42.688
I work damn near 50 hours
a week and you know it.

45:42.755 --> 45:45.490
Ma and I are doing just fine.

45:45.557 --> 45:46.391
Aren't we, Ma?

45:50.730 --> 45:53.199
She hasn't eaten a thing.

45:53.266 --> 45:56.202
I know.

45:57.336 --> 45:59.806
I don't know if she
had another nightmare.

45:59.873 --> 46:01.608
She just seems exhausted.

46:03.143 --> 46:05.610
- Nightmare?
- Mm-hmm.

46:05.677 --> 46:06.746
Hmm.

46:13.152 --> 46:14.221
What's wrong, Ma?

46:15.221 --> 46:17.190
You haven't touched your food.

46:17.257 --> 46:19.659
I'm afraid I'm
just not very hungry.

46:21.393 --> 46:24.129
You need to try and
eat a little something.

46:24.197 --> 46:26.298
What's the matter?
Didn't you sleep good?

46:28.201 --> 46:31.438
I had a nightmare, I think.

46:32.871 --> 46:36.576
It was like there was
someone in the house.

46:37.443 --> 46:38.711
In your dream?

46:39.846 --> 46:41.048
I think so.

46:43.449 --> 46:44.550
I don't know.

46:47.554 --> 46:49.889
Is it the one that
you told me about?

46:49.956 --> 46:51.824
The one that shakes the walls?

46:51.891 --> 46:52.892
Yeah.

46:52.958 --> 46:55.694
It's like there's
someone in the house

46:55.762 --> 46:58.131
and they're coming
up the stairs.

47:00.266 --> 47:02.601
I went to bed at 10:30,

47:04.336 --> 47:05.806
but I didn't really sleep.

47:09.242 --> 47:10.477
Better call Dr. Yang.

47:11.643 --> 47:13.445
Could be a side effect
to your medication.

47:13.512 --> 47:15.547
Tony, it's not the meds.

47:15.614 --> 47:17.349
I'm not crazy.

47:17.416 --> 47:19.818
Hey, hey, hey, no one
says you were crazy.

47:19.885 --> 47:20.920
We're just trying to help.

47:20.987 --> 47:21.788
Well, if you wanna help me,

47:21.855 --> 47:25.657
get me a big guard dog or a gun.

47:25.724 --> 47:27.460
What, so you can take
pot shots through the walls

47:27.527 --> 47:29.228
every time you hear a noise?

47:29.295 --> 47:32.498
Ma, there's gotta be
something going on here.

47:32.565 --> 47:34.567
It could be something
with your meds,

47:34.634 --> 47:36.469
maybe something else.

47:36.536 --> 47:37.737
Oh, for God sake, Tony.

47:37.804 --> 47:39.405
I'm not fruit loops.

47:41.306 --> 47:42.475
I know you're not, Ma.

47:43.909 --> 47:46.312
That's why I wanna check
in with your doctor.

47:50.782 --> 47:55.453
We'll talk it out
later, all right?

47:55.521 --> 47:57.657
All right, bye.

47:58.824 --> 47:59.692
Hey, Tony.

48:03.396 --> 48:04.264
Hey, Tony.

48:05.364 --> 48:07.699
I'm really sorry I
snapped at you earlier.

48:07.766 --> 48:08.800
Don't sweat it.

48:11.003 --> 48:13.672
I'm really stressed out
about this whole thing.

48:13.739 --> 48:15.740
I mean, she was fine one moment

48:15.807 --> 48:17.443
and then it just
seems like she's not,

48:17.510 --> 48:20.746
and I don't know if
it's depression or-

48:20.813 --> 48:23.583
- Look, you're trying hard.

48:23.650 --> 48:25.483
We all see it.

48:25.550 --> 48:27.253
I'm sorry I gave you shit
about the mail, all right?

48:27.320 --> 48:29.755
Tony, I don't give
a fuck about the mail.

48:29.822 --> 48:30.690
I just...

48:33.860 --> 48:35.695
Do you think she's
gonna be okay?

48:42.434 --> 48:43.469
I wish I could say.

48:44.536 --> 48:47.439
I just don't know
what to do anymore.

48:47.507 --> 48:48.375
Yeah.

48:51.443 --> 48:53.813
It may be time she
saw that specialist.

49:06.592 --> 49:07.660
Fuck.

49:17.336 --> 49:18.871
I need protection.

49:21.106 --> 49:21.873
What?

49:21.940 --> 49:23.509
I said, I need protection.

49:23.576 --> 49:24.878
I don't feel safe.

49:26.045 --> 49:27.613
Mom, we'll do
whatever it takes.

49:27.679 --> 49:29.882
Don't worry. We'll
get an alarm system.

49:29.949 --> 49:31.884
We'll bar up the windows.

49:31.951 --> 49:33.686
- I've got you.
- I need to be able

49:33.753 --> 49:35.621
to do something.

49:35.688 --> 49:36.956
You can do something.

49:37.023 --> 49:38.824
You can call me at any time

49:38.891 --> 49:39.724
and I'll be right over.

49:39.791 --> 49:42.360
- You know that.
- I'm scared.

49:42.427 --> 49:45.431
Oh, Mom, you don't have to be.

49:45.498 --> 49:47.300
I've got you.

49:47.367 --> 49:48.668
Do you?

49:48.735 --> 49:51.403
Yes, of course.

49:51.471 --> 49:52.672
How about this?

49:52.739 --> 49:55.608
I'll come over right before
bed and just you and I

49:55.675 --> 49:57.376
can go through the
house and make sure

49:57.443 --> 49:59.979
it's all nice and
tight, locked up.

50:00.045 --> 50:02.982
No offense, Donna, but
I'd rather have a gun.

52:34.666 --> 52:35.534
Hey.

52:36.869 --> 52:37.670
Can we meet?

53:44.737 --> 53:47.139
Jim.

53:47.206 --> 53:48.807
Jim!

53:48.873 --> 53:49.741
Hey.

54:30.416 --> 54:31.384
Donna?

54:31.449 --> 54:33.585
Is that the daughter
that took off?

54:33.652 --> 54:34.919
Yep.

54:34.987 --> 54:35.855
Hmm.

54:37.389 --> 54:39.724
I guess she just got
sick of the crazy old broad

54:39.791 --> 54:41.759
and just left.

54:41.827 --> 54:44.229
Mm, God. Talk about loyalty.

54:44.295 --> 54:45.297
Who does something like that?

54:45.364 --> 54:48.934
I don't think it's
an easy decision.

54:49.001 --> 54:50.869
I mean, I hope not.

54:50.936 --> 54:53.038
I mean, she had people
depending on her.

54:53.105 --> 54:54.039
She had to know the anguish

54:54.106 --> 54:55.942
she put her mom
through by leaving.

54:57.275 --> 54:59.744
You'd think that'd be enough
to make some people stay.

54:59.811 --> 55:00.679
Yeah well,

55:02.681 --> 55:06.985
trying to hold a family
together is not easy.

55:07.052 --> 55:07.987
What do you mean?

55:11.222 --> 55:13.659
My mom died two years ago.

55:15.860 --> 55:16.895
Oh my God.

55:18.329 --> 55:19.764
I'm so sorry.

55:19.831 --> 55:24.268
It's okay. It
was angiosarcoma.

55:24.335 --> 55:28.340
Which is this like really
rare type of breast cancer.

55:29.809 --> 55:31.110
She went to the dermatologist

55:31.177 --> 55:33.713
because she had this
rash that popped up.

55:35.146 --> 55:36.748
And then by the end of the day,

55:36.815 --> 55:39.718
she was in the emergency
room getting tests done.

55:41.753 --> 55:42.621
Jesus.

55:43.956 --> 55:47.726
And I remember I was at
some frat party on campus

55:47.793 --> 55:51.030
when my sister texts
me and she's like,

55:52.431 --> 55:54.032
"Mom is in the emergency room

55:54.099 --> 55:56.235
and she's getting all
these tests done."

55:57.335 --> 55:59.738
And we both just knew

56:00.972 --> 56:03.442
they weren't gonna
come back negative.

56:06.144 --> 56:07.413
Jim.

56:07.480 --> 56:11.083
It's sad, you know, because

56:14.753 --> 56:17.422
she was always so
positive about everything.

56:17.489 --> 56:19.157
She was like, "I'm
gonna beat it.

56:19.224 --> 56:21.226
I'm going to beat it."

56:24.996 --> 56:26.030
We knew she wasn't gonna beat it

56:26.097 --> 56:28.634
but it's not like you
can tell her that.

56:33.038 --> 56:36.074
Look Jim, I didn't
mean to pry, you know, I-

56:36.141 --> 56:38.143
- No, it's okay.

56:39.344 --> 56:40.913
I'm actually kind
of surprised Collin

56:40.980 --> 56:42.148
hasn't told you already.

56:44.150 --> 56:46.318
He's the only person I
told when I came here.

56:47.987 --> 56:49.121
He kind of met me
at a rough time.

56:49.188 --> 56:51.256
Yeah, you mentioned that part.

56:53.259 --> 56:58.264
So yeah, Mom died
and Dad asked me

56:59.798 --> 57:04.001
to take a year off of school
because he couldn't handle

57:04.068 --> 57:05.337
taking care of my sister.

57:07.338 --> 57:08.340
He was a mess.

57:09.842 --> 57:13.512
All of us, the
entire family unit

57:13.579 --> 57:18.217
just completely
emotionally fucked.

57:23.222 --> 57:24.424
And they needed me.

57:25.690 --> 57:27.259
They needed me to be there
to take care of them.

57:27.326 --> 57:29.461
But I just couldn't do it.

57:29.527 --> 57:31.230
I didn't have the
stomach for it.

57:34.132 --> 57:37.069
So here I am,

57:38.971 --> 57:40.106
house sitting.

57:41.239 --> 57:42.107
It's okay.

57:44.275 --> 57:46.878
Look, Jim, what I
said about Donna,

57:46.945 --> 57:48.280
- you know, I didn't mean that-
- No, it's,

57:50.114 --> 57:51.082
it's okay.

57:51.150 --> 57:56.054
I just, I get the need to

57:56.121 --> 58:00.358
get out so you can just breathe.

58:05.864 --> 58:06.631
You know what?

58:06.699 --> 58:08.066
We could use some more wine.

58:08.132 --> 58:09.868
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

58:22.581 --> 58:24.016
We made short use of that.

58:25.951 --> 58:26.985
Hey, can I ask you something?

58:27.052 --> 58:30.289
And just like promise
you won't get mad.

58:31.556 --> 58:33.091
Well I guess that depends.

58:34.226 --> 58:35.094
On what?

58:39.063 --> 58:42.335
Depending on what
you ask me, I guess.

58:46.371 --> 58:47.306
Do you love him?

58:49.041 --> 58:50.509
I'm sorry.

58:50.576 --> 58:54.313
I just, I need to know how bad

58:54.380 --> 58:55.847
I'm fucking things up here.

58:56.681 --> 58:59.517
You are very conceited.

58:59.585 --> 59:00.853
You know that?

59:01.954 --> 59:04.056
I like Collin, okay?

59:04.123 --> 59:05.389
He's sweet.

59:05.456 --> 59:07.058
And he's funny.

59:10.329 --> 59:11.531
Yeah, I guess I love him.

59:12.998 --> 59:14.532
- Then why-
- Why

59:14.599 --> 59:15.933
am I sleeping with you?

59:16.001 --> 59:16.668
Yeah.

59:17.635 --> 59:19.438
'Cause I'm fucked up too.

59:20.438 --> 59:22.540
Just like you're fucked up.

59:22.608 --> 59:25.010
And Donna, apparently,
where ever she is,

59:25.077 --> 59:27.246
she's probably doing
something fucked up.

59:30.215 --> 59:31.884
I mean, I don't know, you
just don't have sole ownership

59:31.951 --> 59:33.150
of drama, I guess.

59:34.552 --> 59:35.520
Yeah, no shit.

59:37.722 --> 59:38.923
I don't know.

59:38.990 --> 59:43.429
Maybe I just don't equate
sex with love anymore.

59:44.663 --> 59:48.032
Maybe I like to engage
in self-sabotage.

59:48.099 --> 59:50.534
You know like, I won't
let myself be happy

59:50.601 --> 59:55.607
because I have no
idea how to be.

59:58.409 --> 01:00:02.580
In any case, I guess
I sleep with you

01:00:02.648 --> 01:00:05.017
because you make me feel safe.

01:00:06.385 --> 01:00:08.254
I know that you
won't fall for me

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:10.989
because Collin is your friend.

01:00:12.358 --> 01:00:15.862
And I know you won't tell on me

01:00:16.628 --> 01:00:18.431
because Collin is your friend.

01:00:21.599 --> 01:00:26.204
Or maybe I can sense
a tragedy in you

01:00:28.072 --> 01:00:29.607
just like me.

01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:38.617
Jesus.

01:00:39.719 --> 01:00:42.621
You really are fucked
up, you know that?

01:00:42.688 --> 01:00:43.890
Absolutely.

01:00:50.795 --> 01:00:53.364
Thank you for staying here.

01:00:53.431 --> 01:00:57.268
I don't, I don't, I don't
like staying here alone.

01:00:57.335 --> 01:00:59.337
I don't like leaving
you here alone.

01:01:54.659 --> 01:01:55.493
Dad?

01:01:59.297 --> 01:02:01.065
I just miss her so much.

01:03:14.505 --> 01:03:16.240
- How you doing, baby?
- Hey.

01:03:16.307 --> 01:03:18.043
Good, how are
you, Auntie Euni?

01:03:19.710 --> 01:03:20.678
Well, come on in.

01:03:24.916 --> 01:03:27.552
So can I get you a
soda or something?

01:03:27.619 --> 01:03:28.687
Oh, no. I'm all good.

01:03:28.753 --> 01:03:29.621
Thanks, though.

01:03:31.923 --> 01:03:34.559
So how's your mother?

01:03:36.594 --> 01:03:37.562
You know, she's
done pretty good.

01:03:37.628 --> 01:03:40.632
She's seeing some
new guy, so I mean,

01:03:40.699 --> 01:03:41.733
seems to like him.

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:43.301
I think he's gonna
stick around this time.

01:03:43.367 --> 01:03:44.335
So that's a good thing.

01:03:44.402 --> 01:03:47.139
And you know, she
was actually asking

01:03:47.206 --> 01:03:48.507
about you the other day.

01:03:48.574 --> 01:03:49.907
Oh, well, yeah.

01:03:49.974 --> 01:03:51.643
I've been meaning
to keep in touch

01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:55.081
but things have been
kind of hard lately.

01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:57.148
Yeah, that.

01:03:58.617 --> 01:04:00.485
I gotta ask, if you don't mind.

01:04:00.552 --> 01:04:04.389
Are you okay? Like, why
do you need a piece?

01:04:04.456 --> 01:04:06.291
Alex, I'm a 70 year old woman.

01:04:06.358 --> 01:04:09.561
I live alone in a big
house on a dead end street.

01:04:09.628 --> 01:04:13.331
I believe that I should
feel safe in my own home.

01:04:13.398 --> 01:04:16.268
Absolutely, Auntie Euni. I
completely understand that.

01:04:16.335 --> 01:04:18.369
- It's just-
- Well "it's just" that what?

01:04:20.271 --> 01:04:22.173
It's just if something
were to happen to you

01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:23.574
or God forbid to somebody else,

01:04:23.641 --> 01:04:25.309
it kind of be my fault.

01:04:25.376 --> 01:04:27.311
Nothing's gonna happen.

01:04:27.378 --> 01:04:28.780
Auntie Euni, come on, look.

01:04:29.947 --> 01:04:33.851
If Tony or Donna or my
mom were to find out.

01:04:33.918 --> 01:04:35.653
They won't.

01:04:35.721 --> 01:04:38.222
Yeah, but if they did,
they'd fucking barbecue my ass.

01:04:38.289 --> 01:04:40.558
- Language.
- Right, sorry.

01:04:40.626 --> 01:04:42.360
Look, nothing's
going to happen.

01:04:42.427 --> 01:04:44.596
Listen, Alex, I'm desperate.

01:04:44.663 --> 01:04:46.697
I haven't slept in nights.

01:04:46.764 --> 01:04:48.634
I hear things in the house.

01:04:49.534 --> 01:04:50.402
Like what?

01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:54.472
I just, I just think

01:04:54.539 --> 01:04:56.608
that I should feel
safe in my own house.

01:04:56.675 --> 01:04:59.778
I think that I
should be prepared

01:04:59.844 --> 01:05:01.879
in case something should happen.

01:05:01.947 --> 01:05:03.715
I understand, okay?

01:05:03.782 --> 01:05:05.717
But look, you know
you can always

01:05:05.784 --> 01:05:06.785
call me if you need anything.

01:05:06.851 --> 01:05:09.587
Me, Donna, any of
us, you can call.

01:05:09.655 --> 01:05:11.690
I know. Thank you.

01:05:12.923 --> 01:05:15.527
All right. But as requested.

01:05:17.862 --> 01:05:19.396
Here.

01:05:19.463 --> 01:05:20.699
So here's the thing, okay?

01:05:21.867 --> 01:05:22.534
The most important
thing is gonna be

01:05:22.601 --> 01:05:23.936
that safety right there.

01:05:25.036 --> 01:05:26.971
Always make sure that's on.

01:05:27.039 --> 01:05:28.340
Alex, I know
how to work a gun.

01:05:28.407 --> 01:05:32.311
I've had a whole lifetime
while you were still a twinkle.

01:05:33.644 --> 01:05:34.512
Okay.

01:05:35.746 --> 01:05:38.282
Hey, it's loaded.

01:05:38.349 --> 01:05:39.317
Good.

01:05:45.590 --> 01:05:47.326
Well, I gotta get out of here.

01:05:48.626 --> 01:05:49.793
I love you, okay?

01:06:25.463 --> 01:06:27.232
Hi, Mom. It's Donna.

01:06:27.898 --> 01:06:29.567
Oh Donna, it's you.

01:06:29.634 --> 01:06:31.302
Oh, it's fine.

01:06:31.369 --> 01:06:33.904
Whatever made you call
me at this late hour?

01:06:33.972 --> 01:06:34.940
What, I can't just call my mom

01:06:35.005 --> 01:06:37.442
to check and see
how you're doing?

01:06:37.509 --> 01:06:39.644
I just wanted to make
sure you're okay.

01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:42.813
I'm fine. I'm doing much
better than last night.

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:44.648
Good, see, I knew that
you would feel better

01:06:44.715 --> 01:06:46.984
once you had a little
time under your belt.

01:06:47.052 --> 01:06:49.354
And know that Tony and
I are here for you.

01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:50.422
Are you gonna get a
good night's sleep?

01:06:50.489 --> 01:06:51.889
Oh, I think so.

01:06:53.023 --> 01:06:54.592
Well that's good.
Well, fingers crossed.

01:06:54.659 --> 01:06:56.027
No more nightmares.

01:06:56.094 --> 01:06:57.996
Oh, I don't think
that will be a problem.

01:06:58.063 --> 01:06:59.731
I'm not afraid anymore.

01:06:59.797 --> 01:07:01.965
Oh, really?

01:07:02.032 --> 01:07:03.835
Well, hopefully that lasts.

01:07:03.902 --> 01:07:05.470
Oh, yes. I have it handled.

01:07:05.536 --> 01:07:06.137
Where is everybody?

01:07:06.204 --> 01:07:07.406
What do you mean?

01:07:08.739 --> 01:07:11.408
Well, I've empowered myself.

01:07:11.476 --> 01:07:13.445
I feel powerful.

01:07:14.478 --> 01:07:16.281
Okay.

01:07:17.449 --> 01:07:18.617
I was just making
sure you're okay.

01:07:18.684 --> 01:07:21.353
I mean, that just doesn't
sound like you, Mom.

01:07:22.753 --> 01:07:23.887
I mean, I'm sorry.

01:07:23.954 --> 01:07:26.423
I just was checking on you, Mom.

01:07:26.490 --> 01:07:27.425
I was just worried.

01:07:28.559 --> 01:07:31.362
You're good though?
You're sure you're okay?

01:07:31.429 --> 01:07:33.030
Absolutely.

01:07:33.097 --> 01:07:34.166
All right, well,

01:07:34.231 --> 01:07:37.568
how about I talk to you
in the morning then?

01:07:37.635 --> 01:07:39.771
All right. I love you, Mom.

01:07:39.838 --> 01:07:40.905
Good night, dear.

01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:47.412
I've heard of
him but I've never met him.

01:07:47.478 --> 01:07:48.746
I worked
for one of his companies

01:07:48.813 --> 01:07:49.614
but I've never seen him.

01:08:23.913 --> 01:08:25.082
There you are.

01:08:25.149 --> 01:08:26.417
Is there coffee?

01:08:28.252 --> 01:08:29.118
I didn't make any.

01:08:29.185 --> 01:08:30.421
Oh, okay, cool.

01:08:30.488 --> 01:08:32.055
I was going to cut back anyway.

01:08:36.895 --> 01:08:37.929
What?

01:08:37.996 --> 01:08:40.698
What do you remember
about last night?

01:08:40.765 --> 01:08:42.700
Ah, I dunno. I
was pretty tipsy.

01:08:42.765 --> 01:08:44.368
- Why?
- After we went to bed.

01:08:46.636 --> 01:08:49.106
Um, no, I don't
know what you mean.

01:08:49.173 --> 01:08:50.376
Did I say something?

01:08:53.645 --> 01:08:55.712
I don't think we
can do this anymore.

01:09:01.051 --> 01:09:02.520
Oh, you're serious?

01:09:04.721 --> 01:09:07.426
Okay. And why is that?

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:09.993
I just don't think
it's a good idea.

01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:12.197
Not a good idea.
Okay, brilliant.

01:09:12.264 --> 01:09:14.731
So did you decide
this before or after

01:09:14.798 --> 01:09:15.934
- we slept together?
- Alys-

01:09:16.001 --> 01:09:16.868
- Well?

01:09:19.037 --> 01:09:21.006
Something, something's wrong.

01:09:22.073 --> 01:09:23.541
Yeah, clearly.

01:09:23.608 --> 01:09:24.542
No, no.

01:09:24.609 --> 01:09:26.678
I mean, something's
wrong with me.

01:09:26.743 --> 01:09:27.813
Mm.

01:09:27.877 --> 01:09:29.747
I don't understand
what's going on anymore.

01:09:29.814 --> 01:09:31.615
You don't understand
what's happening?

01:09:31.682 --> 01:09:33.149
Because it seems like
you've been doing

01:09:33.216 --> 01:09:34.917
exactly what you want.

01:09:34.984 --> 01:09:36.555
It's, I just...

01:09:38.555 --> 01:09:39.490
It's just too much.

01:09:39.557 --> 01:09:41.627
Okay, it is too much.

01:09:42.792 --> 01:09:45.863
And I just, I need
you to understand.

01:09:45.930 --> 01:09:48.198
- Oh, I understand.
- Jesus Christ.

01:09:50.001 --> 01:09:53.872
Can I ever just tell
you how I'm feeling

01:09:53.939 --> 01:09:56.508
without you freaking
out every time?

01:09:56.574 --> 01:09:57.975
Fuck you, Jim!

01:09:58.042 --> 01:09:59.710
How you're feeling?

01:09:59.778 --> 01:10:01.279
Because it seems
like you're feeling

01:10:01.345 --> 01:10:02.980
like you want me to off.

01:10:03.914 --> 01:10:05.582
And you know what?

01:10:05.649 --> 01:10:07.050
I don't need this shit.

01:10:07.118 --> 01:10:08.454
I don't need any of it.

01:10:09.954 --> 01:10:11.789
And if you tell Collin anything,

01:10:12.724 --> 01:10:13.625
I will deny it.

01:10:14.592 --> 01:10:16.194
And he'll believe me.

01:10:17.127 --> 01:10:19.096
You remember that, Jim.

01:10:39.751 --> 01:10:40.619
Hey Jimbo.

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:42.788
Hey, Dad.

01:10:43.988 --> 01:10:46.690
What's up? How is everything?

01:10:46.757 --> 01:10:48.559
Everything's good.

01:10:48.627 --> 01:10:51.195
How are you liking
that house-sitting job?

01:10:51.261 --> 01:10:55.099
Look Dad, I don't
have a lot of time.

01:10:55.166 --> 01:10:59.270
So I just wanted to call and

01:11:01.139 --> 01:11:02.239
tell you that I love you.

01:11:02.306 --> 01:11:06.911
And I'm really sorry
that I haven't called.

01:11:08.078 --> 01:11:13.085
And I'm gonna call a
lot more from now on.

01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:17.255
Well, I love you too, Jim.

01:11:18.756 --> 01:11:20.190
Is everything okay?

01:11:20.257 --> 01:11:21.792
Yeah, everything's fine.

01:11:21.859 --> 01:11:25.228
I just, I wanted to
call and say I love you

01:11:25.296 --> 01:11:29.101
and I love Caitlin.

01:11:31.670 --> 01:11:33.005
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

01:11:33.070 --> 01:11:35.841
And your sister's gonna be
really happy to hear from you.

01:11:38.309 --> 01:11:40.045
I have to go. I'm sorry.

01:11:42.881 --> 01:11:43.749
Okay.

01:11:45.149 --> 01:11:46.217
Okay, um...

01:11:47.152 --> 01:11:47.952
Bye, Jim.

01:12:00.998 --> 01:12:02.166
Hey, thanks
for coming over, man.

01:12:02.233 --> 01:12:04.034
Of course,
brother. You know it.

01:12:04.101 --> 01:12:05.036
It's your last night here.

01:12:05.103 --> 01:12:07.070
- We gotta do it up.
- Hmm, thanks.

01:12:07.137 --> 01:12:08.972
When does the
old lady get back?

01:12:09.039 --> 01:12:10.774
I don't know. Sometime
tomorrow morning, I think.

01:12:10.841 --> 01:12:13.744
But they could be back any time.

01:12:13.811 --> 01:12:17.881
Oh, should I be here?

01:12:17.948 --> 01:12:20.817
Yeah, no, they said I
could have people over.

01:12:20.885 --> 01:12:23.855
Besides, I don't like
being here alone.

01:12:24.889 --> 01:12:26.257
It started
getting creepy, huh?

01:12:27.425 --> 01:12:28.359
Kind of.

01:12:28.426 --> 01:12:32.063
Fucking told you,
bro. I knew it.

01:12:32.130 --> 01:12:33.230
You see anything?

01:12:34.198 --> 01:12:36.333
- Like what?
- Anything?

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:38.403
Anything paranormal?

01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:39.771
Unexplained?

01:12:40.837 --> 01:12:42.773
No, nothing like
that. It's just...

01:12:44.074 --> 01:12:46.943
I don't know. I started
getting uneasy here at night.

01:12:48.112 --> 01:12:50.715
Mm, so maybe the
old lady isn't crazy.

01:12:50.782 --> 01:12:53.118
No, no, she most
definitely is.

01:12:56.755 --> 01:12:58.422
Did you bring any weed?

01:12:58.489 --> 01:13:00.824
Does the Pope
shit in the woods?

01:13:00.891 --> 01:13:01.893
Good.

01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:03.194
Well, we're gonna
have to smoke now

01:13:03.261 --> 01:13:05.096
because if dude gets back
and it smells like weed,

01:13:05.162 --> 01:13:06.030
I'm in for it.

01:13:07.231 --> 01:13:08.966
He was pretty specific.

01:13:09.033 --> 01:13:10.101
He said "no weed?"

01:13:10.167 --> 01:13:11.435
Mm-hmm.

01:13:11.502 --> 01:13:13.438
What fucking year is it?

01:13:13.505 --> 01:13:14.771
I know.

01:13:14.838 --> 01:13:16.140
Man.

01:13:16.207 --> 01:13:17.075
Okay.

01:13:25.315 --> 01:13:26.850
Problem solved.

01:13:26.917 --> 01:13:28.251
Cheers, bro.

01:16:30.368 --> 01:16:31.903
Can I finish?

01:16:31.970 --> 01:16:35.172
And she just keeps sucking.

01:16:35.238 --> 01:16:38.041
Legs shaking, face tingling.

01:16:38.109 --> 01:16:39.077
Uh!

01:16:39.143 --> 01:16:41.444
Out of commish,
donezo after that.

01:16:41.511 --> 01:16:43.849
- Mm.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

01:16:44.649 --> 01:16:46.251
Uh, not...

01:16:47.652 --> 01:16:48.586
Yeah.

01:16:48.653 --> 01:16:50.621
Only girl to
make my toes curl.

01:16:50.688 --> 01:16:51.556
Mm.

01:16:54.057 --> 01:16:55.493
Yeah.

01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:57.128
God, that girl.

01:16:57.194 --> 01:17:01.164
She could suck the
varnish off a footstool.

01:17:01.231 --> 01:17:02.667
Mm.

01:17:02.734 --> 01:17:04.536
I think I'm gonna
have to marry her.

01:17:05.403 --> 01:17:07.405
Yeah, yeah, you should, um,

01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:11.208
lock that down for sure.

01:17:11.274 --> 01:17:14.577
So I know you said
that you don't like it

01:17:14.645 --> 01:17:16.614
when I show you these photos,

01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:20.216
but she sent me this last night.

01:17:20.283 --> 01:17:22.586
Look at those mamma jammas.

01:17:25.689 --> 01:17:28.158
- Nice.
- Yeah.

01:17:28.225 --> 01:17:30.127
She's fucking perfect, bro.

01:17:31.029 --> 01:17:31.897
Mm.

01:17:36.167 --> 01:17:37.302
You okay, bro?

01:17:38.301 --> 01:17:41.972
Yeah. I'm just tired.

01:17:44.074 --> 01:17:46.010
I didn't really sleep.

01:17:51.048 --> 01:17:52.050
Feeling homesick?

01:17:53.518 --> 01:17:54.484
Yeah. Yeah.

01:17:54.551 --> 01:17:55.920
Something like that.

01:17:59.623 --> 01:18:01.492
I'm sorry to have
to do this to you

01:18:01.559 --> 01:18:04.128
but I think I have to
just like go upstairs

01:18:04.194 --> 01:18:05.528
and get some sleep.

01:18:05.595 --> 01:18:07.297
I know I asked you
to come hang out.

01:18:07.364 --> 01:18:08.398
No, bro. That's fine.

01:18:08.466 --> 01:18:09.334
Yeah, go ahead.

01:18:12.302 --> 01:18:13.104
Are you sure
you're gonna be okay,

01:18:13.171 --> 01:18:15.539
just like hanging out down here?

01:18:15.605 --> 01:18:17.140
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, I'll be fine.

01:18:17.207 --> 01:18:18.274
I'll just sit on the couch,

01:18:18.341 --> 01:18:20.110
have a couple beers, watch TV.

01:18:21.479 --> 01:18:22.414
Go get some sleep.

01:18:23.346 --> 01:18:25.282
All right. Thank you.

01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:44.635
Are you sure you're okay
hanging out here alone?

01:18:44.702 --> 01:18:46.369
Stop asking.

01:18:46.436 --> 01:18:47.771
Go to sleep.

01:18:47.838 --> 01:18:48.707
Okay.

01:19:13.663 --> 01:19:14.731
Alyson?

01:19:14.798 --> 01:19:17.768
Jim. Please.

01:19:20.137 --> 01:19:22.273
Please, something's wrong!

01:19:32.283 --> 01:19:34.419
Come back for more beer?

01:19:38.389 --> 01:19:39.355
Jim?

01:20:10.387 --> 01:20:11.256
Collin?

01:22:09.407 --> 01:22:10.673
Mom?

01:23:02.626 --> 01:23:03.695
We're home.

01:23:05.962 --> 01:23:06.965
Here you go.

01:23:11.502 --> 01:23:12.403
Hello?

01:23:15.538 --> 01:23:16.840
Where the fuck is that kid?

01:23:16.907 --> 01:23:17.942
Tony.

01:23:19.510 --> 01:23:20.979
Jim, you here?

01:23:24.381 --> 01:23:25.815
Where you going, Ma?

01:23:25.882 --> 01:23:26.983
I'm tired, honey.

01:23:27.051 --> 01:23:28.620
I'm going to bed.

01:23:38.028 --> 01:23:39.596
Prick.

01:23:39.662 --> 01:23:42.366
Probably out spending my money.

01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:30.548
Jim?

01:24:33.716 --> 01:24:34.585
Jim?

01:24:37.020 --> 01:24:37.889
Jim!

01:24:42.158 --> 01:24:44.628
What did you party too hard?

01:24:47.730 --> 01:24:48.599
Oh!

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:51.402
What is that?

01:25:02.212 --> 01:25:03.081
Ma?

01:25:40.717 --> 01:25:41.586
Oh, no!

01:25:45.655 --> 01:25:46.690
Wait, please.

01:25:48.893 --> 01:25:51.395
I just wanted to rest.

01:25:53.697 --> 01:25:55.032
You'll never get to.

01:25:56.065 --> 01:25:59.635
She'll never let
you sleep again.

01:25:59.703 --> 01:26:00.571
Please.

01:26:01.738 --> 01:26:05.075
Wait, please, don't do,
don't do that, please!

01:26:05.141 --> 01:26:06.876
Good night.

01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:12.750
Oh, God.

01:26:23.827 --> 01:26:24.695
Jim?

01:26:25.662 --> 01:26:26.662
Jim?

01:26:26.729 --> 01:26:27.897
Oh my God!

01:26:34.837 --> 01:26:36.106
Baby, it's okay.

01:26:37.574 --> 01:26:38.608
It's okay.

01:26:38.676 --> 01:26:39.843
We're gonna be okay.

01:26:39.909 --> 01:26:41.244
Okay?

01:26:46.850 --> 01:26:47.718
Jim?

01:26:48.752 --> 01:26:50.120
Jim?
