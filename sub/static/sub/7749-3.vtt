WEBVTT

00:03.100 --> 00:08.265
(phones ringing,
indistinct chatter)

00:08.300 --> 00:10.359
No, that's not what he said.

00:10.410 --> 00:12.071
No, it's not.

00:12.110 --> 00:13.475
Because it isn't.

00:13.510 --> 00:15.603
No, I...
(grumbles)

00:15.640 --> 00:17.039
Look”.

00:17.080 --> 00:20.049
No. Listen, I have to go.

00:20.080 --> 00:22.344
(hangs up)

00:22.390 --> 00:24.381
You can sit.

00:28.390 --> 00:30.381
Mr. Agos...
A-gos?

00:30.430 --> 00:32.819
A905.
A905.

00:32.860 --> 00:36.728
Mr. Agos, I am your pretrial
service officer, Joy Grubick.

00:36.770 --> 00:39.068
You've been released on bond
awaItIng trial

00:39.100 --> 00:41.193
and your release has come
with certain conditions.

00:41.240 --> 00:44.164
My job is to see to it that you
live up to those conditions

00:44.210 --> 00:46.701
and to report to the court
on your compliance.

00:46.740 --> 00:47.809
Do you understand?

00:47.840 --> 00:50.673
I do. _
In my supervrsory
capacity,

00:50.710 --> 00:53.577
I will regularly meet with
you, your lawyer, your employer,

00:53.620 --> 00:56.316
and other col_lateral witnesses
to ascertain your fitness

00:56.350 --> 01:00.184
for continued bond release. Hmm?

01:00.220 --> 01:02.654
You are currently
employed?

01:02.690 --> 01:03.850
Iam.

01:03.890 --> 01:06.552
I-I don't see any entry

01:06.600 --> 01:07.851
for direct supervisory
employer here.

01:07.900 --> 01:09.720
Yeah, I don't
really have

01:09.770 --> 01:12.295
an employer. I'm a partner
at my law firm.

01:14.170 --> 01:15.637
I need a name.

01:15.670 --> 01:18.639
Um...

01:18.670 --> 01:20.137
Alicia Florrick.

01:20.180 --> 01:22.603
My other partner.

01:22.650 --> 01:26.245
You need any information on drug
or alcohol treatment programs

01:26.280 --> 01:28.441
while subject to release?
No.

01:28.480 --> 01:30.516
Have you used
any controlled substances

01:30.550 --> 01:32.359
since your
release?
No.

01:32.390 --> 01:35.188
Have you partaken
of any alcoholic beverages?

01:35.220 --> 01:37.324
Mm, no... A beer.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.426
One beer?

01:40.460 --> 01:42.291
Yes.
And...

01:42.330 --> 01:44.469
when did you consume this beer?

01:44.500 --> 01:46.798
Uh, after my release.

01:46.840 --> 01:50.264
There was a celebration
With a few coworkers.

01:50.310 --> 01:51.299
(both exhale)

01:51.340 --> 01:53.501
Mm... Was this
at a bar?

01:53.540 --> 01:54.905
No, at my apartment.

01:54.940 --> 01:58.205
You said this was
a celebration With a few people.

01:58.250 --> 01:59.808
And who were they?

02:01.220 --> 02:02.881
Oh.

02:02.920 --> 02:04.888
You want to know their names?

02:04.920 --> 02:07.514
Yes.

02:07.560 --> 02:09.255
Actually, it was
probably just one.

02:15.560 --> 02:16.720
I need a name.

02:18.200 --> 02:20.395
Kalinda. Sharma.

02:20.440 --> 02:21.896
Let me see your hand.

02:21.940 --> 02:24.534
Although you are not
explicitly forbidden alcohol,

02:24.570 --> 02:26.538
we would advise against
any triggers for abuse.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.229
I understand.

02:28.280 --> 02:30.748
(phones ringing,
indistinct chatter)

02:30.780 --> 02:32.247
JOY:
How are you

02:32.280 --> 02:33.918
handling your release, Mr. Agos?

02:33.950 --> 02:35.747
How am I handling it?

02:35.780 --> 02:38.180
Fine, I guess.
I wasn't in that long.

02:38.220 --> 02:40.279
Any disagreements
at work?

02:40.320 --> 02:42.880
DEAN:
We need more space.
I can't bring my clients here.

02:42.930 --> 02:44.454
ALICIA:
We're already overextended.
We can't just...

02:44.490 --> 02:45.923
All right,
everyone stop.

02:45.960 --> 02:47.928
No, everything went well.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.269
Well, how's your employer
handling your return?

02:50.300 --> 02:52.336
Alicia?

02:52.370 --> 02:54.634
That is the heart and soul
of Lockhart/Gardner.

02:54.670 --> 02:56.831
We took their six
top department heads.

02:56.870 --> 02:58.735
Why are you screwing this u...

02:58.770 --> 03:01.637
She handled it very well.

03:01.680 --> 03:03.545
A condition of your bail
is that you

03:03.580 --> 03:05.502
inform your clients
of your current status.

03:05.550 --> 03:08.576
Have you done so,
either by letter or in person?

03:08.620 --> 03:10.838
Yes, in person.

03:10.890 --> 03:12.858
And what did you say?

03:12.890 --> 03:15.256
Two weeks ago I was arrested
for transporting

03:15.290 --> 03:17.258
$1.3 million in heroin.

03:17.290 --> 03:19.827
Um... Obviously,
I didn't do it.

03:19.860 --> 03:21.748
ALICIA:
In fact, we think
that the state's attorney

03:21.800 --> 03:25.258
brought these charges because
Cary is such an effective

03:25.300 --> 03:27.860
advocate.
I still plan to be
involved with all my cases,

03:27.900 --> 03:30.300
but we also have other attorneys
who are willing to step in

03:30.340 --> 03:32.535
We don't want any
interruption in your service.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.502
We want to keep you
as a client.

03:34.540 --> 03:37.407
So what do you
think, Mr. Clay?

03:37.450 --> 03:38.872
And did you lose
any clients after

03:38.910 --> 03:40.343
informing them of your status?

03:40.380 --> 03:42.439
Yeah, a few.
How many?

03:42.490 --> 03:45.744
Four.
And who have you retained?

03:45.790 --> 03:47.758
Cary,

03:47.790 --> 03:50.520
I had some issues
in my youth.

03:50.560 --> 03:52.528
Stole a car.

03:52.560 --> 03:54.255
Went for a joyride,

03:54.300 --> 03:56.268
crashed into some barbed wire.

03:56.300 --> 03:59.337
I was in jail
for four months.

03:59.370 --> 04:01.338
That's where
I turned my life around.

04:01.370 --> 04:03.008
Forgiveness isn't just
a nicety to me,

04:03.040 --> 04:04.928
it's my life.

04:04.970 --> 04:08.599
So, yes, I want you
to stay on my case.

04:08.640 --> 04:11.347
Thank you.
Thank you, Ed.

04:11.380 --> 04:13.348
Dean?

04:13.380 --> 04:14.642
(door opens)

04:14.680 --> 04:15.817
Mr. Pratt.

04:15.850 --> 04:18.387
Dean Levine-Wilkins.
Good to meet you.

04:18.420 --> 04:20.615
Nice to meet you.
Dean and I will
argue In court,

04:20.660 --> 04:22.787
but purely under
Cary's supervision.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.354
Good.

04:24.390 --> 04:27.496
(indistinct chatter
over loudspeaker)

04:29.670 --> 04:32.298
Yes, I know
you have to get back to court.

04:36.870 --> 04:39.475
Mr. Agos, let me
give you some advice.

04:39.510 --> 04:42.343
I do this
because I care.

04:42.380 --> 04:43.904
I know it doesn't sound like it,

04:43.950 --> 04:46.646
but that's just the way I talk.

04:46.680 --> 04:49.649
You can't live life
the way you used to.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.385
You can't just
have a beer.

04:51.420 --> 04:54.389
You can't just associate
with your old friends.

04:54.420 --> 04:56.820
You need to treat this seriously

04:56.860 --> 04:59.556
or you will end up
behind bars again.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.556
You understand?

05:01.600 --> 05:03.295
I think I do.

05:05.130 --> 05:07.064
Good.

05:07.100 --> 05:09.295
See you next week.

05:12.010 --> 05:13.671
DEAN:
What is this, Mr. Pratt?

05:13.710 --> 05:15.575
It's a seed.
A seed.

05:15.610 --> 05:19.944
A seed with a genetic
protective shell?

05:19.980 --> 05:23.086
PRA'I'I':
Yes. Our scientists call it
a full metal jacket.

05:23.120 --> 05:24.985
A full metal jacket.

05:25.020 --> 05:27.352
Objection. We all heard,
including His Honor.
Again,

05:27.390 --> 05:29.483
the defense attorney
is abusing his objections.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.020
You're objecting
to my objections?
You know

05:31.060 --> 05:32.596
what you're doing...
(all clamoring)

05:32.630 --> 05:33.790
JUDGE:
Stop it, everybody stop!

05:33.830 --> 05:36.128
The objection
is overruled.

05:36.160 --> 05:37.491
Let's go, Mr. Schmidt.

05:37.530 --> 05:38.963
I mean, Mr....

05:39.000 --> 05:40.490
You.

05:40.540 --> 05:42.098
Thank you, Your Honor.

05:42.140 --> 05:44.608
Mr. Pratt, you're a farmer
yourself, aren't you?

05:44.640 --> 05:47.370
I am. My dad, too.
Four generations.
And that's

05:47.410 --> 05:49.776
why you started
the company?
Yes. We wanted to

05:49.810 --> 05:51.448
create a seed that could

05:51.480 --> 05:54.119
genetically withstand
whatever nature threw at it.

05:54.150 --> 05:55.617
Okay, so how
much did it

05:55.650 --> 05:59.416
cost to develop this
seed? This seed here?

05:59.460 --> 06:00.859
$400 million.

06:00.890 --> 06:03.450
$400 million.

06:03.490 --> 06:05.424
Well, then why are you
suing Mr. Keller? He's

06:05.460 --> 06:06.449
a farmer
just like yourself,

06:06.500 --> 06:07.922
isn't he?
Patent infringement.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.769
We received a tip
he was brown-bagging.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.722
DEAN: _
I'm sorry-- brown-bagging?

06:11.770 --> 06:14.591
Uh, saving and replanting
seeds from his harvest.

06:14.640 --> 06:16.858
Okay, the Supreme Court held

06:16.910 --> 06:19.606
in J.E.M. Ag Supply v. Pioneer

06:19.640 --> 06:21.574
that saving patented seeds

06:21.610 --> 06:22.975
is illegal?
It's my own seed.

06:23.010 --> 06:24.875
On my own land.
ALICIA:
Your Honor.

06:24.910 --> 06:26.719
Your Honor..._
He's Simply stating
the obvious.

06:26.750 --> 06:27.739
He can state the obvious
when you're questioning him...

06:27.780 --> 06:29.987
Mr. Levine-Wilkins
has yet to even establish...

06:30.020 --> 06:32.488
(gavel banging,
attorneys arguing)
Shut up!

06:32.520 --> 06:35.580
We're taking a
five-minute recess.

06:35.620 --> 06:37.429
CARY:
Alicia,

06:37.460 --> 06:38.757
watch it with Ed.

06:38.790 --> 06:40.428
I don't think he likes
all the fighting.

06:40.460 --> 06:41.893
It's just bluster.

06:41.930 --> 06:44.125
I know that,
but he doesn't.

06:44.170 --> 06:45.421
SCHMIDT:
Mr. Pratt,

06:45.470 --> 06:47.836
do you have
a monopoly on

06:47.870 --> 06:49.508
seed distribution
in Kane County, Illinois?

06:49.540 --> 06:51.531
I don't know if I'd
call it a monopoly.

06:51.570 --> 06:52.832
My seeds are very popular.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.075
Isn't my client
the only farmer in Kane

06:55.110 --> 06:57.601
who doesn't use your seeds?
Yes,

06:57.650 --> 06:59.515
I think that's right.
And that makes
him a target?

06:59.550 --> 07:01.541
Objection, Your Honor.
Argumentative.

07:01.580 --> 07:03.047
Sustained. Move
on, Mr. Schmidt.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.479
SCHMIDT: Thank you.
I have here a chart

07:05.520 --> 07:08.080
from the National
Weather Service.

07:08.120 --> 07:10.554
Can you tell me what it shows?

07:10.590 --> 07:12.057
Wind speed and wind direction.

07:12.090 --> 07:13.694
Good.

07:13.730 --> 07:16.460
Now, every farm
surrounding Mr. Keller's land

07:16.500 --> 07:18.718
uses your seeds,

07:18.770 --> 07:21.238
so isn't it possible
that these high winds

07:21.270 --> 07:22.737
blew your patented seeds
onto my client's field?

07:22.770 --> 07:23.759
ALICIA:
Objection.

07:23.810 --> 07:24.868
Calls for speculation.

07:24.910 --> 07:26.059
If Mr. Schmidt

07:26.110 --> 07:28.738
wants to question
a meteorologist,

07:28.780 --> 07:30.202
then bring in
a meteorologist.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.878
GLA'I'I': Sustained.
Move on, Mr. Schmidt.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.740
DIANE:
I have some good news.

07:34.780 --> 07:35.940
And some bad news?

07:35.980 --> 07:38.642
No, just... good news.

07:38.690 --> 07:40.089
You're so tense.

07:40.120 --> 07:44.056
The state's attorney lost
its witness against you.

07:44.090 --> 07:45.751
What?

07:45.790 --> 07:48.099
The confidential informant
on Bishop's crew--

07:48.130 --> 07:49.722
the one wearing the wire.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.726
He was the cornerstone
of the case.

07:51.770 --> 07:52.964
And they lost him.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.798
How did they lose him?

07:55.840 --> 07:57.068
I have no idea.

07:57.110 --> 07:58.600
He just went missing.

07:58.640 --> 08:01.575
He was_scared
of testifying.

08:01.610 --> 08:05.740
But without him, the state's
attorney has no case.

08:11.320 --> 08:13.015
It's not over yet.

08:13.060 --> 08:16.689
The ASA is asking for
a continuance at 2:00.

08:16.730 --> 08:19.722
But I-I do think
the judge will dismiss.

08:19.760 --> 08:23.696
So don't lose hope.

08:23.730 --> 08:26.790
Did Bishop get to him?

08:26.840 --> 08:29.661
The C.I.--
did Bishop get to him?

08:29.710 --> 08:31.769
Oh, I don't think
he knew about him.

08:31.810 --> 08:33.539
Anyway, I've got to go.

08:33.580 --> 08:34.729
I'll see you at 2:00.

08:34.780 --> 08:38.170
Thank you, Diane.

08:48.020 --> 08:51.183
You said they had
a C.I. with a wire.

08:51.230 --> 08:52.754
Yeah.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.758
I think that's gonna
take care of itself.

08:57.800 --> 08:59.995
ALICIA:
It's because you know
you have no case.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.735
GLA'I'I': I see you've forgotten
the rules of questioning!

09:01.770 --> 09:03.761
You three get so excited
about winning arguments,

09:03.810 --> 09:05.061
you forget the point!

09:05.110 --> 09:06.668
Mrs. Florrick.
ALICIA: Thank you, Your Honor.

09:06.710 --> 09:10.009
Mrs. Toms, is that man
over there a customer

09:10.050 --> 09:11.677
at your feed and seed store?

09:11.710 --> 09:12.847
TOMS: Yes, ma'am.
He bought our non-GMO seeds.

09:12.880 --> 09:14.677
He wasn't anti-GMO

09:14.720 --> 09:16.244
or anything, just...

09:16.280 --> 09:18.339
he said he didn't want to pay
big prices.

09:18.390 --> 09:20.711
And did he stop buying
these seeds in 2012?

09:20.760 --> 09:21.784
Yeah. He told
my husband...

09:21.820 --> 09:23.026
Objection, Your Honor.
Hearsay.

09:23.060 --> 09:24.857
DEAN: 804 exception,
Your Honor.

09:24.890 --> 09:26.118
Declar_ant is
unavailable.

09:26.160 --> 09:28.025
Mrs. Toms' husband
is deceased.

09:28.060 --> 09:29.869
SCHMIDT: That doesn't
make any difference.
GLA'I'I': Wait. Wait.

09:29.900 --> 09:30.969
Mrs. Toms, did Mr. Keller

09:31.000 --> 09:32.092
_ever discuss
With you directly

09:32.130 --> 09:34.837
why he stopped buying seeds?

09:34.870 --> 09:36.269
TOMS: No.
Then I sustain the objection.

09:36.300 --> 09:37.836
DEAN: Your Honor,
this is ridiculous.

09:37.870 --> 09:39.167
SCHMIDT: What's ridiculous
is Mrs. Florrick

09:39.210 --> 09:40.871
not being able
to accept a loss...

09:40.910 --> 09:44.971
(gavel banging,
attorneys arguing)
GLA'I'I': Hey! Shut up!

09:45.010 --> 09:45.999
Did you call?

09:46.050 --> 09:47.642
My wife did.
He has time.

09:47.680 --> 09:49.147
Good.

09:49.180 --> 09:51.740
We're gonna have
to tell them.
The lawyers?

09:51.790 --> 09:54.008
It's just better to give
them a foregone conclusion.

09:54.060 --> 09:56.688
CARY:
What foregone conclusion?

09:56.730 --> 10:00.655
Cary... this isn't
working for us.

10:00.700 --> 10:01.951
What isn't?

10:02.000 --> 10:03.865
The trial.

10:03.900 --> 10:05.891
Sir, you should be talking
to your own lavwer.

10:05.930 --> 10:07.761
That's the problem.

10:07.800 --> 10:09.734
It's about the lavwers,
not us.

10:09.770 --> 10:11.738
Wendell is my neighbor.

10:11.770 --> 10:13.874
I have a disagreement
with him,

10:13.910 --> 10:14.979
not with you all.

10:15.010 --> 10:17.069
My wife just called
an arbitrator.

10:17.110 --> 10:18.702
He can start
with us immediately.

10:18.750 --> 10:21.218
Well, Ed, arbitration is
exactly like court.

10:21.250 --> 10:22.217
Just as binding, just as...

10:22.250 --> 10:23.888
This is different.

10:23.920 --> 10:27.412
Welcome to binding
Christian arbitration.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.918
My name is De! Paul.

10:30.960 --> 10:33.224
Mr. Pratt and Mr. Keller
have requested this forum

10:33.260 --> 10:34.852
because they believe
there is a better way

10:34.900 --> 10:38.267
than the adversarial approach
of blame and denial.

10:38.300 --> 10:40.336
It's called the Matthew process.

10:40.370 --> 10:44.238
And yes, lawyers,
that is a real thing.

10:44.270 --> 10:47.899
_ Jesus tells us_:
if your brother sms,

10:47.940 --> 10:50.374
go and point out his fault,
just between the two of you.

10:50.410 --> 10:53.709
And if he doesn't listen,
take one or two others along

10:53.750 --> 10:56.116
so that every matter
may be established

10:56.150 --> 10:58.380
by the testimony
of two or three witnesses.

10:58.420 --> 11:00.786
So, why don't
we begin?

11:00.820 --> 11:02.856
Let us pray.

11:02.890 --> 11:05.154
Lord, we thank
you for this day,

11:05.190 --> 11:08.250
and we thank you for
these professionals

11:08.300 --> 11:10.860
who just want to
see justice done.

11:10.900 --> 11:12.891
SCHMIDT
Mr. Pratt,

11:12.940 --> 11:14.862
do you have a monopoly
on seed distribution

11:14.900 --> 11:16.834
in Kane County,
Illinois?

11:16.870 --> 11:18.906
Well, I don't know
if I'd call it a monopoly.

11:18.940 --> 11:20.703
My seeds are very popular.

11:20.740 --> 11:22.105
Isn't my client
the only farmer

11:22.140 --> 11:24.347
in Kane who doesn't
use your seeds?

11:24.380 --> 11:26.109
Yes, I think that's right.

11:26.150 --> 11:27.811
And that makes
him a target?

11:27.850 --> 11:29.886
Objection.
Argumentative. Come on.

11:29.920 --> 11:31.717
Go ahead, you can answer.

11:31.750 --> 11:33.752
Uh, sorry,

11:33.790 --> 11:36.111
sir, but the question
was inflammatory.

11:36.160 --> 11:38.879
No. I think he can handle it.

11:38.930 --> 11:41.228
Go ahead.
PRA'I'I':
Wendell is only

11:41.260 --> 11:43.899
a target in the
sense that if people

11:43.930 --> 11:46.069
take my seed without paying,
I would go out of business.

11:46.100 --> 11:47.465
SCHMIDT:
I have here

11:47.500 --> 11:48.865
a chart from

11:48.900 --> 11:50.060
the National Weather Service.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.862
Can you tell me
what it shows?

11:51.910 --> 11:53.229
PRA'I'I':
Wind speed,
wind direction.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.929
SCHMIDT:
Isn't it possible

11:54.980 --> 11:56.868
these high winds blew
your patented seed

11:56.910 --> 11:58.309
onto my client's field?

11:58.350 --> 12:00.375
Objection. Calls
for speculation.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.308
If you want to question
a meteorologist,

12:02.350 --> 12:03.988
Mr. Schmidt, do so.

12:04.020 --> 12:05.908
Del. (laughs)

12:05.950 --> 12:08.214
I'm feeling a little
attacked here.

12:08.260 --> 12:09.750
PAUL:
Look, every answer

12:09.790 --> 12:11.428
will only get us closer
to the truth.

12:11.460 --> 12:12.927
So, let's just
answer honestly.

12:12.960 --> 12:16.919
Okay, Your Honor...
uh, Del,

12:16.970 --> 12:19.063
that is an improper question.

12:19.100 --> 12:21.068
It seems proper to me.

12:21.100 --> 12:23.102
Not for a layman,
or a non-meteorologist.

12:23.140 --> 12:25.961
But Mr._ Pratt must have
an opinion. We all do.

12:26.010 --> 12:29.946
So, let's just hear his.

12:29.980 --> 12:31.470
Well, sure, it's possible.

12:31.510 --> 12:33.011
SCHMIDT:
It's possible high winds

12:33.050 --> 12:35.177
blew your seed
onto my client's land?

12:35.220 --> 12:36.847
Sure.
Well,

12:36.890 --> 12:39.108
if that's true,
isn't it possible

12:39.150 --> 12:41.482
this seed on his
land is just...

12:41.520 --> 12:43.181
part of God's plan?

12:43.230 --> 12:45.528
Oh.

12:45.560 --> 12:47.494
(loud, overlapping shouting)

12:47.530 --> 12:49.828
DIANE:
Without their confidential
informant, Your Honor,

12:49.870 --> 12:51.326
the state's attorney's
office has no case.

12:51.370 --> 12:52.997
We have a recording
of the defendant

12:53.040 --> 12:54.439
perpetrating this crime.

12:54.470 --> 12:55.937
Allegedly
perpetrating.

12:55.970 --> 12:58.359
And my client has a
Sixth Amendment right

12:58.410 --> 12:59.934
to confront his accuser.

12:59.980 --> 13:02.005
Which presupposes that
Trey Wagner is our only witness.

13:02.040 --> 13:04.076
Is he?
No.

13:04.110 --> 13:05.873
PETROV:
Ah, here's the
accused now.

13:05.910 --> 13:08.276
Come join us
in the lovely bond court.

13:08.320 --> 13:10.345
My apologies, Your Honor. I was
in court on another matter.

13:10.390 --> 13:11.539
DIANE:
The fact that the
ASA has requested

13:11.590 --> 13:13.080
a delay in preliminary

13:13.120 --> 13:14.451
suggests that he has no evidence

13:14.490 --> 13:16.412
other than this one witness.

13:16.460 --> 13:18.189
I'm afraid that Ms. Lockhart
has been misinformed
about our motion.

13:18.230 --> 13:20.095
We're not asking
for a delay in preliminary.

13:20.130 --> 13:22.394
We're asking
for revocation of bail.

13:22.430 --> 13:24.990
DIANE:
Your Honor, this is...
What has Mr. Agos

13:25.030 --> 13:26.520
ever done to warrant
revocation of bail?

13:26.570 --> 13:29.095
The day that Mr. Agos
was released from holding,

13:29.140 --> 13:31.938
the primary witness against
him, Trey Wagner, disappeared.

13:31.970 --> 13:33.437
_ DIANE: _
That is completely irrelevant.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.607
We have evidence Mr. Agos
intimidated the witness.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.949
What evide_nce? _
A report from his pretrial
services officer

13:37.980 --> 13:40.141
that he met with Kalinda Sharma
after his release.

13:40.180 --> 13:42.944
Kalinda Sharma then
approached Trey Wagner.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.083
Your Honor, this is
attack by supposition.
POLMAR: Which is why we need

13:45.120 --> 13:47.088
a revocation
of bail hearing.
DIANE: Mr. Agos has already

13:47.120 --> 13:49.088
been through a source
of funds hearing.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.122
Now the county wants a
revocation of bail hearing?

13:51.160 --> 13:52.479
This is... this is
Kafka in action.

13:52.530 --> 13:54.088
PETROV:
The longer I
live, the more

13:54.130 --> 13:56.928
I realize that
everything is Kafka in action.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.119
I will hear
arguments on Tuesday.

13:58.170 --> 13:59.865
POLMAR:
Thank you, Your Honor.

13:59.900 --> 14:01.390
Next.
(sighs)

14:01.440 --> 14:04.932
They're gonna get me
one way or another.

14:17.390 --> 14:21.417
(overlapping chatter)

14:21.460 --> 14:23.485
JOY:
Well, that's not what he said.

14:23.530 --> 14:26.090
No, it isn't.

14:26.130 --> 14:27.950
No, no, that's not what he said.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.422
No, he didn't say that.

14:29.460 --> 14:32.896
Uh... no. Look,
I have to go. Good-bye.

14:32.940 --> 14:34.464
(phone hangs up)

14:34.500 --> 14:36.900
Hi.

14:36.940 --> 14:38.407
My name is Joy Grubick,

14:38.440 --> 14:41.603
and I'm the pretrial service
officer for Cary Agos.

14:41.640 --> 14:45.406
And as such, it is my job
to write a report to the court

14:45.450 --> 14:48.613
on Cary's compliances
with, uh, his bond obligations.

14:48.650 --> 14:50.641
Looks like you already did that.

14:52.120 --> 14:53.917
I'm sorry?

14:53.960 --> 14:55.518
You already did that.

14:55.560 --> 14:58.085
The court is holding
a revocation of bail hearing

14:58.130 --> 14:59.483
based on your report.

14:59.530 --> 15:01.691
No, no, no.
(laughs)

15:01.730 --> 15:03.391
That was based on my notes.

15:03.430 --> 15:06.399
Ah. Well, that's a comfort.

15:06.430 --> 15:08.637
You're Mr. Agos' employer?

15:08.670 --> 15:10.467
No, I'm his partner.

15:10.510 --> 15:13.399
Well, yes, but, for my report,
I need to declare an employer.

15:13.440 --> 15:17.376
Well, that's too bad, because
he doesn't have an employer.

15:19.680 --> 15:21.648
Okay.

15:21.680 --> 15:24.581
And how has Cary
been doing at work,

15:24.620 --> 15:26.383
Mrs. Florrick?

15:26.420 --> 15:28.581
We took their six
top department heads.

15:28.620 --> 15:30.656
Why are you fighting me on this?

15:30.690 --> 15:32.726
Because this is BS.

15:32.760 --> 15:34.591
They are not ours!

15:34.630 --> 15:36.097
They want to change...

15:36.130 --> 15:39.429
Well. He's doing well.
Good.

15:39.470 --> 15:42.564
_ I understand he was
in court yesterday and today.

15:42.600 --> 15:45.103
Yesterday, but not today.

15:45.140 --> 15:47.472
And afterwards,
after court?

15:47.510 --> 15:50.070
CARY: Alicia, do
you have a minute?
What's up?

15:50.110 --> 15:51.577
We heard you were staffing
your campaign office.

15:51.610 --> 15:54.078
You... No.
Where did you hear that?

15:54.120 --> 15:55.610
A reporter called me
for comment.

15:55.650 --> 15:57.982
She asked if I had a_
p05ition on your campaign.

15:58.020 --> 15:59.544
I didn't even know
there was a campaign

15:59.590 --> 16:01.217
to have an opinion about.

16:01.260 --> 16:03.649
Yes?

16:07.230 --> 16:10.529
You want to hear
what happened afterwards, right?

16:10.570 --> 16:12.595
Yes, after court.

16:12.630 --> 16:15.690
The state's attorney met
with me.

16:18.570 --> 16:21.004
I see. Was Cary Agos with you?

16:21.040 --> 16:23.247
No. Mr. Castro just came
to see me.

16:23.280 --> 16:25.305
Well, then it's not important.
We can move on.

16:25.350 --> 16:27.568
You don't want to hear about
Mr. Castro threatening Cary?

16:30.350 --> 16:31.487
I'm not threatening Cary.

16:31.520 --> 16:35.081
It sounds like you did.
No.

16:35.120 --> 16:37.429
I'm saying,
Cary's case will go away

16:37.460 --> 16:38.779
if he testifies against Bishop.

16:38.830 --> 16:40.695
That's what we call
plea bargaining.

16:40.730 --> 16:44.564
Mr. Castro, you don't come
to Cary, who's in the next room.

16:44.600 --> 16:47.569
You don't come to his lawyer,
Diane Lockhart. You come to me.

16:47.600 --> 16:50.364
Who are you really
threatening here?

16:50.410 --> 16:51.559
I really don't need
to hear all this.

16:51.610 --> 16:53.271
You don't want to hear

16:53.310 --> 16:55.403
about the state's attorney's
threats?

16:55.440 --> 16:57.203
They're not relevant
to my report.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.707
But I'm not finished yet.
CASTRO: Are you asking

16:59.750 --> 17:02.571
whether this has anything
to do with your campaign?

17:02.620 --> 17:04.588
Let's just be clear, Mr. Castro.

17:04.620 --> 17:07.418
You're making a connection
between Cary Agos' prosecution

17:07.460 --> 17:08.654
and your campaign

17:08.690 --> 17:10.157
for State's Attorney.

17:10.190 --> 17:12.579
No. I'm doing the opposite.

17:12.630 --> 17:16.418
I'm saying Cary's prosecution
has nothing to do with politics.

17:16.460 --> 17:18.599
But...

17:18.630 --> 17:20.495
Here we go.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.167
Well, it won't look good
for your campaign, will it?

17:22.200 --> 17:25.067
Your partner being in prison.

17:27.710 --> 17:29.473
(phone chimes)

17:29.510 --> 17:31.671
You want to repeat that,
Mr. Castro?

17:34.180 --> 17:37.149
No... but...

17:37.190 --> 17:39.784
I will say this.

17:39.820 --> 17:42.618
It's a bad idea to run, Alicia.

17:42.660 --> 17:46.528
Very few saints survive
oppo research.

17:46.560 --> 17:48.721
(phone chimes off)

17:53.600 --> 17:54.589
I'm not running.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.198
I'm gonna stop you right there.

17:56.240 --> 17:57.559
You don't want
to hear more?

17:57.610 --> 17:58.804
No, it's just that

17:58.840 --> 18:00.398
that's all the time we have.

18:00.440 --> 18:03.102
But thank you.

18:03.150 --> 18:04.708
And good luck.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.274
With?

18:06.310 --> 18:07.743
With your campaign.

18:07.780 --> 18:11.238
I heard about it
on the drive in.

18:11.290 --> 18:14.589
It was on Morning Edition.

18:14.620 --> 18:16.554
Eli, what...?

18:16.590 --> 18:18.478
I know. I heard the
Morning Edition thing, too.

18:18.530 --> 18:19.781
I had nothing
to do with it.

18:19.830 --> 18:21.752
They said I opened
a campaign office.

18:21.800 --> 18:24.564
No, they quoted a blog saying
you opened a campaign office.

18:24.600 --> 18:26.465
But you haven't,
so the quote is wrong.

18:26.500 --> 18:28.639
(beep)
WOMAN: Mr. Gold, Mrs. Florrick
is here to see you.

18:28.670 --> 18:30.433
Thank you, Nora.

18:30.470 --> 18:32.609
Your precognitive
powers amaze me.

18:32.640 --> 18:34.301
Tell them it's wrong.
What?

18:34.340 --> 18:35.739
Tell them_
I'm not running.
No.

18:35.780 --> 18:38.146
You just feed the fire
if you tell them things.
No.

18:38.180 --> 18:39.670
I feed the fire.
You feed them on background.

18:39.710 --> 18:40.870
Okay, talk to Steve Inskeep

18:40.920 --> 18:43.514
at the fund-raiser tomorrow.

18:43.550 --> 18:45.643
What? No. Who?
From Morning Edition.

18:45.690 --> 18:47.908
He'll be at the fund-raiser
tomorrow night. Did you forget?

18:47.960 --> 18:50.520
No. When?

18:50.560 --> 18:52.528
7:00 pm.
Talk to him.

18:52.560 --> 18:54.323
It's the only way to
nip this in the bud.

18:54.360 --> 18:55.657
I have to get to church.

18:55.700 --> 18:59.818
Good. Atheism
doesn't play anyway.

18:59.870 --> 19:02.191
SCHMIDT:
Congratulations,

19:02.240 --> 19:03.639
Ms. State's Attorney.

19:03.670 --> 19:05.900
Actually, no, it's all wrong.
I'm not running.

19:05.940 --> 19:07.703
DEAN:
Really? Did you hear
Morning Edition?

19:07.740 --> 19:09.833
They got it wrong.
I'm not running.

19:09.880 --> 19:12.474
Cary, do you have a second?

19:13.720 --> 19:15.574
How was your
P.S.O. interview?

19:15.620 --> 19:17.815
Good. Or I don't know.
I had a bit of an edge.

19:17.850 --> 19:19.841
But I'm not so sure
that's a bad thing.

19:19.890 --> 19:23.223
Well, thank you, and
I've been thinking.

19:23.260 --> 19:24.818
This-this rule
change in arbitration

19:24.860 --> 19:26.828
isn't necessarily a
bad thing, either.

19:26.860 --> 19:28.748
What are you thinking?

19:28.800 --> 19:32.759
Mrs. Toms, is that man
over there a customer at

19:32.800 --> 19:34.438
your seed store?

19:34.470 --> 19:36.438
He is. Wendell bought
our non-GMO seeds.

19:36.470 --> 19:38.609
He wasn't anti-GMO
or anything. Just...

19:38.640 --> 19:40.699
GMO? Uh, what's that?

19:40.740 --> 19:42.435
Genetically-modified
organism.

19:42.480 --> 19:43.708
Wendell said he just didn't
want to pay big prices.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.547
ALICIA:
Good.

19:45.580 --> 19:48.743
And did he stop buying seeds
at your store in 2012?

19:48.780 --> 19:50.748
Yeah. He told my
husband that he...
SCHMIDT:
Objection, Your Honor.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.746
Del. Hearsay.

19:52.790 --> 19:55.315
And, uh, rule 804
does not apply here.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.328
Mrs. Toms is a widow,

19:57.360 --> 19:59.248
and a Christian woman who has
something to share, so...

19:59.290 --> 20:00.928
Isn't that right,
Mrs. Toms?

20:00.960 --> 20:03.793
So, shouldn't she be allowed to
speak honestly and forthrightly?

20:03.830 --> 20:05.764
Well, first of all,
you don't need to gild the lily.

20:05.800 --> 20:08.337
Second of all,
she hasn't said anything yet.

20:08.370 --> 20:09.769
SCHMIDT:
Yes, but, Del,

20:09.800 --> 20:11.461
I know what she will say.

20:11.510 --> 20:13.705
She has no firsthand knowledge
of the events

20:13.740 --> 20:15.469
she's being asked
to give testimony for.

20:15.510 --> 20:17.569
Mrs. Toms, have you been telling
the truth here today?

20:17.610 --> 20:18.872
TOMS: I have.
PAUL: Then you may
answer the question.

20:18.910 --> 20:20.411
SCHMIDT:
Del?
Mr. Schmidt,

20:20.450 --> 20:21.747
_ I know _
this may seem foreign to you,

20:21.780 --> 20:23.680
but you have to
trust the process.

20:25.650 --> 20:28.949
(clearing his throat)

20:28.990 --> 20:33.324
Mrs. Toms,
what did your departed husband

20:33.360 --> 20:34.952
tell you?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.729
That Wendell said he didn't need
to buy seed from us anymore

20:36.760 --> 20:38.899
because he
"hit the mother lode."

20:38.930 --> 20:40.864
And by "hitting
the mother lode," you believe

20:40.900 --> 20:43.505
that Mr. Keller was taking
and planting Mr. Pratt's seeds?

20:43.540 --> 20:45.667
Yeah. Why else would he
not need our seed anymore?

20:45.710 --> 20:47.337
Uh, can I break in here?

20:47.380 --> 20:49.336
Why don't we ask him?

20:49.380 --> 20:51.507
What?

20:51.550 --> 20:53.347
Why don't we ask Wendell? He's

20:53.380 --> 20:56.645
sitting right here.
I'm staring right at him.

20:56.680 --> 20:57.942
Why don't we
just ask him?
Your Honor...

20:57.990 --> 21:00.652
Del, he hasn't been sworn in.

21:00.690 --> 21:04.751
Yes, but we've been trusting
Mrs. Toms.

21:04.790 --> 21:06.018
Why don't we just trust Wendell?

21:06.060 --> 21:07.925
Mr. Keller,

21:07.960 --> 21:09.894
have you been planting
these seeds of Mr. Pratt's?

21:09.930 --> 21:11.761
Well...

21:11.800 --> 21:15.463
Del, I'm going to instruct
my client not to answer.

21:15.500 --> 21:18.367
No. Guys...
If you'd...

21:18.410 --> 21:20.901
That's not how this works--
the Matthew process.

21:20.940 --> 21:24.979
Just answer the question,
just tell the truth.

21:26.950 --> 21:29.874
Do I replant seed? Sure.

21:29.920 --> 21:31.740
Always have, always will.

21:31.790 --> 21:34.315
PAUL:
Ed's seeds?
I don't know.

21:34.360 --> 21:37.784
Is it possible some
of Ed's seed got onto my land

21:37.830 --> 21:40.424
and I replanted them? Sure.

21:40.460 --> 21:42.826
Okay, well, uh, Del,

21:42.860 --> 21:45.624
I congratulate our defendant
on his honesty,

21:45.670 --> 21:46.864
but that's our whole suit.

21:46.900 --> 21:48.436
He admitted his complicity.

21:48.470 --> 21:49.937
No.

21:49.970 --> 21:51.961
Did you intend

21:52.010 --> 21:53.932
to plant these seeds, Wendell?
It doesn't matter

21:53.980 --> 21:55.072
if he intended to. Intent is
irrelevant to patent law.

21:55.110 --> 21:56.805
He just admitted...

21:56.840 --> 21:58.046
But intent is relevant here.

21:58.080 --> 22:00.071
1 Samuel 16:7.

22:00.110 --> 22:01.816
"God sees not as man sees,

22:01.850 --> 22:04.410
"for man looks
at the outward appearance;

22:04.450 --> 22:05.849
but God looks
at the heart."

22:05.890 --> 22:08.654
Come on. He just admitted
to breaking the law.

22:08.690 --> 22:11.887
No, he admitted
to not being conscious

22:11.930 --> 22:15.559
of breaking
the law.

22:15.600 --> 22:16.953
(knocking)

22:17.000 --> 22:18.865
Grace?

22:18.900 --> 22:20.891
Do you have
a minute?

22:20.940 --> 22:22.567
Yeah.

22:30.080 --> 22:32.742
ALICIA:
"My conscience is clear, but
that does not make me innocent.

22:32.780 --> 22:34.577
It is the Lord who judges me."

22:34.620 --> 22:37.145
So... doesn't that mean...

22:37.180 --> 22:40.786
that you can sin
and not even know it?

22:40.820 --> 22:42.856
I guess.
So intent

22:42.890 --> 22:45.552
is irrelevant to guilt.
Yeah, but that's
only one verse.

22:45.590 --> 22:47.899
Yeah, but that's all I need. I'm
just looking for a precedent.

22:47.930 --> 22:49.852
That's called prooftexting,
Mom. You can't do that.

22:49.900 --> 22:52.391
You have to look at what
the whole Bible says.

22:52.430 --> 22:55.035
But aren't all the verses
con5idered true?

22:55.070 --> 22:57.800
Well, yeah, but you
can't pick and choose.

22:57.840 --> 23:00.638
I'm a lawyer.
That's what I do.

23:00.680 --> 23:03.137
(both chuckle)

23:03.180 --> 23:06.877
So you really believe
all this, Grace?

23:06.910 --> 23:09.879
The Tower of Babel?
Noah's Ark? Everything?

23:09.920 --> 23:13.117
I don't know if
it's all historically accurate.

23:13.150 --> 23:15.118
But...

23:15.160 --> 23:18.049
I think it can be true
in another way.

23:18.090 --> 23:19.887
What other way?

23:19.930 --> 23:21.852
Well, you know, like poetry.

23:21.900 --> 23:24.528
It can still be true
even if it's not accurate.

23:24.570 --> 23:27.164
Hmm.
Look,

23:27.200 --> 23:29.998
ifI wanted you to remember
that God created everything,

23:30.040 --> 23:31.029
I'd probably tell you a story

23:31.070 --> 23:33.038
about it happening
in seven days.

23:33.070 --> 23:36.039
Like, that doesn't actually mean
that it happened in seven days.

23:36.080 --> 23:39.140
It just means
that I wanted you to remember

23:39.180 --> 23:41.410
that God created everything.

23:42.620 --> 23:46.010
Did you just...
make all that up?

23:46.050 --> 23:48.018
Yeah, why?

23:48.060 --> 23:51.723
Well, it sounds... smart.

23:51.760 --> 23:54.058
Well, thanks for
being surprised.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.989
(chuckles)
(chuckling):
Oh, my gosh.

23:57.030 --> 24:00.534
Okay. So I can use
the first quote.

24:00.570 --> 24:02.765
What is it?
1 Corinthians.

24:02.800 --> 24:07.976
And he'll come back at me
with 1 Samuel 16:7.

24:08.010 --> 24:10.069
What can I use?

24:10.110 --> 24:12.670
Romans: "I would not
have known what Sln was

24:12.710 --> 24:14.109
had it not been
for the law."

24:14.150 --> 24:16.948
Right, good. The law.
Yeah.

24:16.980 --> 24:18.516
Oh, and look at
his translation.

24:18.550 --> 24:20.654
Um, I think it's American
Standard Version.

24:20.690 --> 24:24.979
Compare it to, uh,
the Revised Standard.

24:25.030 --> 24:26.622
ALICIA:
"If a person sins
and does something

24:26.660 --> 24:29.026
"the Lord has commanded
not to do,

24:29.060 --> 24:31.961
"even if he doesn't know it,
he is still guilty.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.991
He is responsible
for his sin."

24:34.040 --> 24:35.962
Leviticus?
Chapter 5,
verse 17.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.865
I think it's pretty clear, Del.

24:37.910 --> 24:39.639
Intent is_
not essential

24:39.670 --> 24:41.831
to sin.
Do you know
what the penalty

24:41.880 --> 24:43.507
for that was,
Alicia,

24:43.550 --> 24:45.506
in Leviticus 5?

24:45.550 --> 24:47.177
The burnt offering
of a male sheep.

24:47.210 --> 24:50.987
Are you suggesting
Mr. Keller burn a sheep?

24:51.020 --> 24:53.113
'Cause we could arrange that.
I see you've both done
your homework.

24:53.150 --> 24:54.651
Del, I
would argue

24:54.690 --> 24:56.658
that New Testament
commands hold sway

24:56.690 --> 24:59.818
over Old Testament commands,
just as Christ came

24:59.860 --> 25:02.192
to fulfill the law.
Not to abolish it.

25:02.230 --> 25:04.266
Yeah, that's
Matthew 5:17.

25:04.300 --> 25:07.929
1 Corinthians 4:
"My conSCIence is clear,

25:07.970 --> 25:09.528
but that _does not
make me innocent."

25:09.570 --> 25:11.265
PAUL:
Thank you. It's good
to see you've all

25:11.310 --> 25:14.108
become bibli_cal scholars
overnight.

25:14.140 --> 25:16.028
But I would agree.

25:16.080 --> 25:19.607
I may have been a little hasty
yesterday.

25:19.650 --> 25:21.743
Clearly the Scriptures
are not as easy to unpack

25:21.780 --> 25:22.974
as I would like.

25:23.020 --> 25:24.647
I'd like to reflect on this,

25:24.690 --> 25:26.112
pray on it,

25:26.150 --> 25:28.710
and I'll return
With my deCI5ion.

25:28.760 --> 25:32.981
Detective Prima, what are we...
what are we looking at here?

25:33.030 --> 25:35.055
That's Trey Wagner,
our confidential informant

25:35.100 --> 25:36.658
in Lemond Bishop's gang.

25:36.700 --> 25:39.123
POLMAR:
Your former
confidential informant?

25:39.170 --> 25:40.990
Yes, unfortunately, yes.

25:43.670 --> 25:46.230
The same night
that Mr. Agos was released.
Here is another photo

25:46.270 --> 25:48.204
of Trey. And who is he with?

25:48.240 --> 25:50.640
That's Kalinda Sharma,
an investigator

25:50.680 --> 25:52.648
working
for Mr. Agos' firm.

25:52.680 --> 25:54.272
(quietly):
Look forward.
No emotion.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.140
And what happened
after this photograph

25:56.180 --> 25:59.638
was taken, Detective?
Trey Wagner disappeared.
We have reason

25:59.690 --> 26:02.113
to believe that Ms. Sharma
passed along a message

26:02.160 --> 26:03.718
from Mr. Agos...
Objection.

26:03.760 --> 26:05.352
Rank speculation.
PETROV:
Sustained.

26:05.390 --> 26:08.325
POLMAR: _
So Trey Wagner was a Witness
against Mr. Agos?

26:08.360 --> 26:10.157
That's right.

26:10.200 --> 26:12.725
Tell me, do you know, was it
a condition of his bail that

26:12.770 --> 26:15.295
he not contact any
of the witnesses?

26:15.340 --> 26:18.036
It was.
Thank you,
Detective.

26:18.070 --> 26:21.369
Mrs. Wagner, your husband
is a confidential informant

26:21.410 --> 26:23.844
for the Chicago Police
Department, is that correct?

26:23.880 --> 26:25.848
MRS. WAGNER:
I've been told that now.
I didn't know before.

26:25.880 --> 26:27.871
POLMAR: And when is
the last time that you saw
your husband, Mrs. Wagner?

26:27.920 --> 26:29.342
Seven days ago. July 1.

26:29.380 --> 26:31.041
Can you describe
the last time you saw him?

26:31.090 --> 26:33.240
MRS. WAGNER:
He came home
around midnight.

26:33.290 --> 26:35.087
He was scared.

26:35.120 --> 26:37.384
He said someone
was gonna kill him.

26:37.420 --> 26:38.853
POLMAR:
And how
did he know that?

26:38.890 --> 26:40.926
MRS. WAGNER:
Some Indian woman told him.

26:40.960 --> 26:42.689
(quietly):
Don't turn around.
Don't do anything.

26:42.730 --> 26:44.197
POLMAR:
Thank you, Mrs. Wagner.
Your Honor,

26:44.230 --> 26:46.095
Kalinda Sharma met Cary Agos
the night

26:46.130 --> 26:47.768
that he was released
from holding.

26:47.800 --> 26:50.098
20 minutes after that,
Trey Wagner was warned

26:50.140 --> 26:52.233
by an Indian woman
that he should be afraid

26:52.270 --> 26:54.636
for his life.

26:56.680 --> 26:58.648
Kalinda. ..
(clears throat)

26:58.680 --> 27:00.648
I can't suborn perjury,

27:00.680 --> 27:03.148
so I'm not gonna ask what
you did or who you met with...

27:03.180 --> 27:05.842
I think that's smart.

27:05.890 --> 27:08.859
But I think it would be good
if there were a way

27:08.890 --> 27:10.858
to impeach
Stacie Wagner's testimony.

27:10.890 --> 27:13.324
I agree.

27:16.330 --> 27:19.891
I'm not worried
about suborning perjury.

27:19.930 --> 27:22.137
Did you threaten Trey Wagner?

27:22.170 --> 27:23.660
No.

27:23.710 --> 27:25.860
You told Bishop he was the C.I.?

27:28.280 --> 27:30.874
You don't want to know, Cary.
And then
you warned Trey

27:30.910 --> 27:32.309
that Bishop
was coming after him,

27:32.350 --> 27:33.840
and that's why he took off.

27:36.350 --> 27:38.739
I have to go.

27:41.220 --> 27:43.859
ALICIA:
I didn't know
you were religious.

27:43.890 --> 27:45.858
I almost_became
a priest.

27:45.890 --> 27:48.324
Really? When?
Right out of
high school.

27:48.360 --> 27:50.863
Why didn't you?

27:50.900 --> 27:53.266
To Kill a Mockingbird.

27:53.300 --> 27:56.269
(laughs)
Yeah.

27:56.300 --> 27:58.404
That book created
a lot of lawyers.

27:58.440 --> 28:02.308
Yeah, I realized
I wanted justice in
this world, not the next.

28:02.340 --> 28:04.205
Hmm.
You?

28:07.210 --> 28:10.145
My name is Joss Acker.
Before you completely
Hi, I'm Frank Seddio.

28:10.180 --> 28:13.081
staff up your campaign office,
I'm a member
of the Black Caucus...

28:13.120 --> 28:15.088
I think we met last year. I was
in the audience at your speech.

28:15.120 --> 28:17.259
Actually, actually, gentlemen,
I'm not running,

28:17.290 --> 28:19.850
and I have a reception
to get to, so...
African-Americans have been

28:19.890 --> 28:21.494
completely ignored in
campaign staffing for years now,

28:21.530 --> 28:23.327
Mrs. Florrick...
The governor said
you would say that.

28:23.360 --> 28:25.294
And I really want you
to know...
Wait. What?

28:25.330 --> 28:27.833
Diversity hires, ma'am.
No, what did you say
about the governor?

28:27.870 --> 28:30.031
My husband?
Yes, he sent me
to see you.

28:30.070 --> 28:32.265
He...

28:32.310 --> 28:35.734
Wait, Mrs. Florrick, please...
Mrs. Florrick, I think you
have a real opportunity...

28:37.440 --> 28:39.101
Alicia, good.

28:39.150 --> 28:41.209
I need you to not talk
about your campaign.

28:41.250 --> 28:42.979
Oh, God, there is no campaign.

28:43.020 --> 28:44.885
Exactly, I need you
not to talk about it.

28:44.920 --> 28:46.114
Where's Peter?

28:46.150 --> 28:48.152
Other side of
the stage. Why?

28:50.060 --> 28:52.028
Have you seen Peter?

28:52.060 --> 28:54.290
Oh, my God.

28:54.330 --> 28:57.493
Oh, no, but thank you.
I'm Gloria Steinem.

28:58.570 --> 29:01.038
Yes. I know.
Uh, Alicia Florrick.

29:01.070 --> 29:03.436
I know that and, also,
I know that your husband

29:03.470 --> 29:06.234
is already speaking.
They just introduced him.

29:06.270 --> 29:08.101
But I hear you're
going to run

29:08.140 --> 29:09.835
for State's Attorney.
That's great.

29:11.410 --> 29:13.207
Oh, uh, no, it's,
um, a little...

29:13.250 --> 29:14.376
that was a little premature.

29:14.420 --> 29:15.876
Why?

29:15.920 --> 29:17.444
Because I'm-I'm...

29:17.480 --> 29:19.084
not sure if I'm running.

29:19.120 --> 29:21.554
And why aren't you sure?

29:21.590 --> 29:25.378
Well, I'm a bit overwhelmed
at the moment.

29:25.430 --> 29:27.284
You know-- life, work.
Okay,

29:27.330 --> 29:29.548
but show me the woman
who isn't overwhelmed.

29:29.600 --> 29:33.263
(laughs)
That is true, yes,
but this is... I'm...

29:33.300 --> 29:34.836
It wasn't my idea.

29:34.870 --> 29:37.088
My-My husband's, um,
chief of staff--

29:37.140 --> 29:39.961
he asked me to run.
Would you do a good
job? You would.

29:40.010 --> 29:41.432
Well, that's not...
that-that's not the point.
No, I think

29:41.480 --> 29:43.300
it is the point.
I think if you would

29:43.340 --> 29:44.944
do a good job,
you should run.

29:44.980 --> 29:48.313
People respect you. And you
could make a difference.

29:48.350 --> 29:50.841
We need more good
women to run.

29:50.890 --> 29:53.279
EMCEE:
Now please welcome feminist icon
Gloria Steinem.

29:53.320 --> 29:54.981
(applause)

29:55.020 --> 29:57.580
Alicia, it was great
talking to you,

29:57.620 --> 29:59.451
but I'm serious. Do run.

30:15.610 --> 30:19.171
STEINEM:
It's very nice talking to you,
Alicia. You could

30:19.210 --> 30:22.441
make it all the way
to the Supreme Court, Alicia.

30:22.480 --> 30:23.469
You're that amazing.

30:25.150 --> 30:28.449
Thank you all. After much
reflection and prayer

30:32.130 --> 30:34.257
I realized that I was wrong.

30:34.300 --> 30:38.122
Knowledge of sin is
to some extent irrelevant.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.263
So I will hear arguments now

30:40.300 --> 30:44.100
on the fact of Ed's seeds
being planted on Wendell's land,

30:44.140 --> 30:46.404
not just the intent.
Del, we

30:46.440 --> 30:48.135
maintain our objection.
I understand.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.478
So...

30:50.510 --> 30:52.398
you may call your next witness,

30:52.450 --> 30:53.940
Alicia,
Dean, Cary.

30:53.980 --> 30:55.311
(briefcase unlocks)

30:55.350 --> 30:57.944
Derek Voss.
I am a forensic botanist.

30:57.990 --> 31:01.050
Mr. Pratt hired me
to do a field study

31:01.090 --> 31:02.978
on plants containing
his seed's genetic marker.

31:03.020 --> 31:04.385
After testing

31:04.430 --> 31:06.557
Mr. Keller's, uh, fields,
what did you find?

31:06.590 --> 31:08.251
I found that
his fields

31:08.300 --> 31:10.222
went from an acceptable
six percent,

31:10.260 --> 31:13.320
uh, of Mr. Pratt's seeds
to 89% in one year.

31:13.370 --> 31:14.632
Can that be

31:14.670 --> 31:17.093
explained by, uh, blow-in?
No,

31:17.140 --> 31:20.064
it's my conclusion that he's
saving and replanting seeds.

31:20.110 --> 31:21.998
DEAN:
Thank you.

31:22.040 --> 31:23.200
(clears throat)

31:23.240 --> 31:24.400
Del, I'll be frank.

31:24.450 --> 31:26.247
This is bad science.

31:26.280 --> 31:28.248
We need an independent
test using

31:28.280 --> 31:30.419
top-of-the-line
DNA sequencers.

31:30.450 --> 31:32.418
PAUL:
And how long would that take?
SCHMIDT: Two months.

31:32.450 --> 31:34.509
ALICIA: Oh, come on, that
is a delaying tactic, Del.
DEAN: That's impossible.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.949
SCHMIDT:
Accuracy takes time.
Am I supposed to...

31:36.990 --> 31:39.185
You know this is
untrue, Wendell.

31:39.230 --> 31:40.925
You've been
replanting my seeds.

31:40.960 --> 31:42.689
With the herbicide
you were usmg,

31:42.730 --> 31:44.425
you would have killed off
everything except our plants.

31:44.470 --> 31:46.119
You know that.
SCHMIDT:
Excuse me,

31:46.170 --> 31:47.467
don't talk to my client, sir.
No,

31:47.500 --> 31:49.138
let them talk.
SCHMIDT: No, Del,

31:49.170 --> 31:50.296
please instruct
Mr. Pratt

31:50.340 --> 31:51.432
this is not a
free-for-all.

31:51.470 --> 31:53.062
No. I agree--

31:53.110 --> 31:55.328
it's time for the two
of them to talk it out.

31:55.380 --> 31:57.974
Wendell, I know you don't live

31:58.010 --> 31:59.978
with your head in the sand.

32:00.010 --> 32:01.443
You're a good man.

32:01.480 --> 32:02.947
A good steward
of the earth.

32:02.980 --> 32:04.413
Just tell the truth.

32:04.450 --> 32:06.441
SCHMIDT: Wendell,
shall we take a break?
0.

32:10.420 --> 32:12.354
I've been replanting your seeds.

32:12.390 --> 32:14.199
I_ know it's
against the law,

32:14.230 --> 32:16.357
but it's
a rotten laW.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.618
(sighs)
I had no choice.

32:18.670 --> 32:21.468
Your seeds were
taking over my land.

32:21.500 --> 32:24.708
You control over 90%
of the market, Ed.

32:24.740 --> 32:27.368
You control the food.

32:27.410 --> 32:29.469
When you control the food,

32:29.510 --> 32:31.501
you control the people.

32:31.550 --> 32:34.474
I'm sorry, Del.

32:34.520 --> 32:36.374
I lied earlier.

32:36.420 --> 32:37.978
I knew what
I was doing.

32:38.020 --> 32:40.989
I lied before God.

32:41.020 --> 32:43.511
And I'm sorry.

32:43.560 --> 32:45.528
PAUL:
Thank you, Wendell.
Thank you for sharing that.

32:45.560 --> 32:46.686
Del.

32:46.730 --> 32:49.221
We thank Wendell
for his honesty.

32:49.260 --> 32:52.093
But, again: that makes
this case simpler.

32:52.130 --> 32:54.269
Yes, it does.

32:54.300 --> 32:57.337
Wendell, since you've
admitted to the infringement,

32:57.370 --> 32:59.099
I have no choice
but to find...

32:59.140 --> 33:01.506
Del, excuse me.

33:01.540 --> 33:04.338
I submit the admission is moot.

33:04.380 --> 33:06.746
W... He just...
What?

33:06.780 --> 33:08.338
Why?

33:08.380 --> 33:11.178
_ _There can be no
infringement because...

33:11.220 --> 33:14.451
the patenting of life
is an affront to God.

33:14.490 --> 33:17.288
(scoffs)
Are you kidding me?

33:17.320 --> 33:19.288
SCHMIDT:
They're messing with nature.
The Bible says

33:19.330 --> 33:21.651
God's creation is good.

33:21.700 --> 33:24.589
ALICIA:
What about weeds? Are _weeds
good? Because our client

33:24.630 --> 33:27.190
knows how to get rid of weeds,
and your client likes that.
Your client is greedy. Greedy.

33:27.230 --> 33:29.289
DEAN:
Our client has
spent $400 million

33:29.340 --> 33:31.365
on R&D for a product
that is feeding the world.

33:31.410 --> 33:32.604
SCHMIDT:
Dean, they own
one gene.

33:32.640 --> 33:34.471
No, what's ridiculous

33:34.510 --> 33:36.728
is Mrs. Florrick
not being able to...
ALICIA: What's ridiculous

33:36.780 --> 33:39.601
is that you don't allow me
to finish questioning...

33:39.650 --> 33:42.141
(overlapping arguing)
What do you want
to do, Wendell?

33:42.180 --> 33:45.479
KELLER:
Look, I'll-I'll pay
you for the seeds

33:45.520 --> 33:47.681
I used, and I guess
I'm your customer.

33:47.720 --> 33:51.383
But I'd appreciate
a discount.
I think that's a good idea.

33:51.430 --> 33:53.625
They own one gene in one seed.
They don't own the plant.

33:53.660 --> 33:55.525
They don't own the sun.
"Render unto Caesar

33:55.560 --> 33:57.494
"what is Caesar's and unto God
God's...

33:57.530 --> 33:59.760
what is _God's." _
Now you're just quoting
random Bible verses.

33:59.800 --> 34:01.836
Are you good?
Yeah. You?

34:01.870 --> 34:04.668
Thanks.

34:04.710 --> 34:06.268
We settled it.

34:07.510 --> 34:09.535
DIANE:
Who is that, Mrs. Wagner?

34:09.580 --> 34:11.309
The man you're kissing.

34:12.610 --> 34:14.316
MRS. WAGNER:
Uh...

34:14.350 --> 34:16.614
DIANE:
It's not your husband,
is it? It's not Trey?

34:16.650 --> 34:19.084
(whimpers)
Was that
a no, ma'am?

34:19.120 --> 34:20.587
That was a no.
Thank you.

34:20.620 --> 34:23.612
We were able to ID. him
as Ellison McFarlane.

34:23.660 --> 34:25.252
Is he your boyfriend,
Mrs. Wagner?

34:25.290 --> 34:26.552
POLMAR:
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance.

34:26.590 --> 34:28.649
Your Honor, Mr.
McFarlane's rap sheet

34:28.700 --> 34:31.589
is extensive.
Assault and battery,

34:31.630 --> 34:33.666
armed robbery,
possession.

34:33.700 --> 34:36.737
He is a dangerous man, with whom
Mrs. Wagner has been carrying on

34:36.770 --> 34:38.431
an affair
for over a year.

34:38.470 --> 34:40.438
She wanted a new life.
She wanted Trey gone.

34:40.470 --> 34:42.574
MRS. WAGNER:
That's not true.
Objection, Your Honor.

34:42.610 --> 34:45.272
This is pure conjecture
with no basis in fact.

34:45.310 --> 34:47.346
Yep, you're right, Mr. Polmar.

34:47.380 --> 34:50.269
Then again, I'm not sure how
much fact you've got either.

34:50.320 --> 34:52.788
I will rule_tomorrow.
In the meantime, Mr. Agos,

34:52.820 --> 34:55.709
try showing up on time,
and stay close to home.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.580
(gavelbangs)
Next.

34:57.620 --> 34:59.759
So no money?

34:59.790 --> 35:02.258
Yep.

35:02.300 --> 35:04.723
Well, at least
they're friends.

35:05.830 --> 35:07.320
Good working With you.
You, too.

35:07.370 --> 35:08.496
Uh-huh.

35:08.540 --> 35:09.837
Do you still believe in God?

35:09.870 --> 35:13.431
Do I? Yeah.

35:13.470 --> 35:15.199
You?

35:15.240 --> 35:16.832
No.

35:16.880 --> 35:18.677
I don't think
I'm genetically built

35:18.710 --> 35:19.904
to believe
in God.

35:19.950 --> 35:22.271
I didn't think I was either.

35:22.320 --> 35:24.743
Until I was.

35:27.690 --> 35:29.180
Alicia, do you
have a minute?

35:29.220 --> 35:30.551
Talk to you later, Alicia.

35:30.590 --> 35:31.921
(quietly):
Who's that?

35:31.960 --> 35:33.757
A new partner.
I was just heading home, Eli.

35:33.790 --> 35:35.599
This will only
take a minute.

35:35.630 --> 35:38.565
Peter needs to endorse tomorrow
for State's Attorney,

35:38.600 --> 35:40.568
and I'm putting together a
list of the top contenders.

35:40.600 --> 35:43.728
I can't put your name
on that list, is that right?

35:43.770 --> 35:45.567
That's right.

35:45.610 --> 35:47.760
Do you have any
other suggestions?

35:49.340 --> 35:50.568
Harold Lutz.

35:50.610 --> 35:51.872
No, we asked him.

35:51.910 --> 35:54.470
Diane Lockhart.
Same. She said no.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.249
Well, who else
is Peter considering?

35:56.280 --> 35:57.542
There was only
one name.

35:57.580 --> 35:58.615
Well, I'm not running.
I know.

35:58.650 --> 35:59.947
He knows. That's not the name.

35:59.990 --> 36:02.550
It's not?
What-What's the name?

36:02.590 --> 36:04.228
James Castro.

36:04.260 --> 36:06.387
Oh, come on, Eli.

36:06.430 --> 36:08.227
He's not endorsing...

36:08.260 --> 36:10.728
Castro is a bad man.
Yes,

36:10.760 --> 36:12.318
and Peter Will grit his teeth
and do it.

36:12.370 --> 36:14.338
James Castro's the only one
who can win,

36:14.370 --> 36:15.837
and Peter needs
to back a winner.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.332
(exhales)

36:20.370 --> 36:21.678
Nice try.

36:21.710 --> 36:22.802
What?
Trying
to psych me

36:22.840 --> 36:24.740
into saying yes.
(chuckles)

36:24.780 --> 36:27.749
No, Alicia,
not everything is about you.

36:27.780 --> 36:29.748
Peter is
endorsmg Castro.

36:29.780 --> 36:34.513
He is a bad man, but sometimes
the world needs bad men.

36:34.560 --> 36:36.687
Unless you have another name.

36:36.720 --> 36:38.688
No.

36:38.730 --> 36:40.652
You.

36:40.690 --> 36:42.624
(mock chuckles)
Okay, thanks.

36:42.660 --> 36:44.696
If I think of another name,
I'll let you know.

36:44.730 --> 36:46.960
Yeah. By tomorrow.
Peter needs to endorse tomorrow.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.889
Otherwise it looks
like he's following the crowd.

36:56.310 --> 36:57.902
STEIN EM:
Alicia,

36:57.940 --> 37:01.774
I'm tired. I need you
to take over for me.

37:11.660 --> 37:12.888
...never say such a thing.
I don't know Why he'd say that.

37:12.930 --> 37:14.795
I never heard him say
such a thing.

37:14.830 --> 37:16.821
N0, I-I did...

37:16.860 --> 37:18.623
I have to go.

37:19.830 --> 37:23.288
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

37:23.340 --> 37:24.932
(groans)

37:24.970 --> 37:27.666
Did you have any questions,
Ms. Grubick?

37:27.710 --> 37:29.837
Um...

37:29.880 --> 37:31.347
yes.

37:31.380 --> 37:33.348
Let me see.

37:35.550 --> 37:39.680
As I said, I'm Cary Agos'
pretrial services officer,

37:39.720 --> 37:42.689
and I just had a few questions
for you as his lawyer

37:42.720 --> 37:45.689
before I submitted
my report to the court.

37:45.730 --> 37:47.823
That is Why I'm here.

37:47.860 --> 37:51.296
I understand you fired
Mr. Agos a year ago.

37:51.330 --> 37:52.991
Yes, at his
old firm.

37:53.030 --> 37:54.691
My old firm.
And, actually,

37:54.740 --> 37:56.833
that wasn't the first time
you fired him, was it?

37:59.410 --> 38:01.776
how secure is his job right now?

38:01.810 --> 38:03.437
(chuckles)
Very.

38:03.480 --> 38:05.778
My job is less secure than his.

38:05.810 --> 38:08.711
But it's my understanding
he's lost many of his clients.

38:08.750 --> 38:10.445
Well, some of
his clients.

38:10.480 --> 38:13.586
And that has not become
an issue?

38:14.820 --> 38:16.913
That's the issue.
I have to impress clients.

38:16.960 --> 38:18.882
You don't.
Whose name's on the letterhead?

38:18.930 --> 38:21.819
(overlapping arguing)
Okay, wait, wait.

38:21.860 --> 38:23.657
No, no issue at all.

38:23.700 --> 38:27.591
And there's no tension
between Cary and his coworkers?

38:27.630 --> 38:28.892
(overlapping arguing)
Three years ago

38:28.940 --> 38:29.929
I could have had my name
on the letterhead.

38:29.970 --> 38:33.098
Cary, let's just listen, okay?

38:33.140 --> 38:34.869
All right, we need to expand.

38:34.910 --> 38:37.470
I mean, this is a charming
space, but our clients are used

38:37.510 --> 38:39.068
to more.
I only say
Your clients?

38:39.110 --> 38:41.078
"our clients"_
because they're more in danger

38:41.110 --> 38:42.771
of leaving for Lockhart/Gardner.

38:42.820 --> 38:44.617
So What do we do?
We have nowhere to go.

38:44.650 --> 38:47.346
Uh, the floor above us
has just become available,

38:47.390 --> 38:48.914
so I propose
we-we build up.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.609
JOY:
Hmm, it is my understanding

38:50.660 --> 38:52.685
that Mr. Agos' bond

38:52.730 --> 38:54.789
has come from his workplace,
your workplace.

38:54.830 --> 38:56.752
That is true.

38:56.800 --> 39:00.588
It's a lot of money.

39:00.630 --> 39:03.963
Is there any chance
the bond would be rescinded

39:04.000 --> 39:06.366
due to financial issues

39:06.410 --> 39:07.661
or any other
reasons?

39:07.710 --> 39:08.904
ALICIA:
Can we afford it?

39:08.940 --> 39:09.975
The second floor?
Well,

39:10.010 --> 39:11.841
Dean
and I talked,

39:11.880 --> 39:14.815
and we would be willing
to finance the first year's rent

39:14.850 --> 39:16.613
via a personal loan
to the firm.

39:16.650 --> 39:18.880
Really?
In exchange for
the loan, uh,

39:18.920 --> 39:20.785
we would like an
executive committee

39:20.820 --> 39:22.959
comprised of three partners
from Florrick-Agos

39:22.990 --> 39:25.049
and three partners
from Lockhart/Gardner.

39:25.090 --> 39:27.888
No, the bond is secure.

39:34.800 --> 39:36.939
Okay.

39:36.970 --> 39:39.939
Is there anything else
you want to tell me?

39:39.970 --> 39:41.437
No.

39:42.480 --> 39:44.698
All right, then.

39:44.750 --> 39:46.479
Thank you.

39:46.510 --> 39:50.412
PETROV:
This has not been
an easy decision.

39:50.450 --> 39:54.113
On the one hand, the defense
has presented a reasonable

39:54.150 --> 39:57.881
alternate theory to Trey
Wagner's disappearance,

39:57.920 --> 40:00.024
but they haven't backed
it up with evidence.

40:00.060 --> 40:02.096
The prosecution, meanwhile,
has a great deal of evidence,

40:02.130 --> 40:03.927
but nothing that leads one

40:03.960 --> 40:07.088
directly to the conclusion
that they would like.

40:07.130 --> 40:09.963
I am left with a tie.

40:10.000 --> 40:13.106
So I've asked the defendant's
pretrial serwces officer

40:13.140 --> 40:17.133
to weigh in, and I'd like her
recommendation on the record.

40:20.850 --> 40:22.977
(quietly):
Oh, God. I'm screwed.

40:23.020 --> 40:24.988
PETROV:
Do you have a recommendation
for the court?

40:25.020 --> 40:26.647
I do.

40:26.690 --> 40:27.816
Please.

40:27.850 --> 40:29.659
(Joy clears throat)

40:29.690 --> 40:33.854
In my sessions with Mr. Agos
and, uh, collateral witnesses,

40:33.890 --> 40:37.519
I saW a man who is terrified
of going back to jail.

40:37.560 --> 40:39.619
He was a deputy
state's attorney,

40:39.670 --> 40:43.834
and, uh, there are prisoners
inside who he put there,

40:43.870 --> 40:46.134
so that makes him
a flight risk.

40:46.170 --> 40:48.968
(exhales)

40:49.010 --> 40:52.104
Uh... but I also saw a man

40:52.150 --> 40:54.710
who is fighting
for his business,

40:54.750 --> 40:58.015
determined to get
his life back.

40:58.050 --> 41:02.214
It is my opinion he knew enough
of the risks to not intimidate

41:02.260 --> 41:05.923
or order the intimidation
of any Witness.

41:05.960 --> 41:08.929
I have concluded
that Mr. Agos

41:08.960 --> 41:12.066
has not broken any
of the conditions of his bond.

41:12.100 --> 41:14.022
PETROV:
Thank you,
Mrs. Grubick.

41:14.070 --> 41:16.163
You may step down.
So there you have it.

41:16.200 --> 41:18.930
Mr. Agos, you Will
remain free on bail.

41:18.970 --> 41:21.029
(gavelbangs)
Next.

41:27.950 --> 41:30.248
You have something to say to me?

41:30.280 --> 41:32.942
No.
(chuckles)

41:32.990 --> 41:36.209
I doubt that. Men always have
something to say.

41:36.260 --> 41:39.081
No. After I put your partner
away for 15 years,

41:39.130 --> 41:40.927
then I'll have
something to say.

41:40.960 --> 41:43.758
If you're still in office.
Oh, so...

41:43.800 --> 41:45.768
that's Why
you're running,

41:45.800 --> 41:47.597
to get your partner
off the hook.

41:47.630 --> 41:51.293
Or so you can keep your client,
Lemond Bishop, out of jail.

41:51.340 --> 41:57.108
Or because your lover was
gunned down in one of my courts.

42:00.780 --> 42:04.546
That's the rumor, aanay.

42:04.590 --> 42:07.548
Will Gardner
was your lover.

42:07.590 --> 42:09.717
You blame me
for his death,

42:09.760 --> 42:11.728
and that's why
you're running.

42:11.760 --> 42:13.978
Retribution.

42:21.100 --> 42:23.091
Anything else?

42:24.140 --> 42:25.903
What do you want?
No.

42:25.940 --> 42:28.602
Get it all off your chest.

42:29.640 --> 42:32.871
Oh, I have a lot on my chest.

42:34.080 --> 42:36.275
I'll save it _for
the campaign.

42:42.020 --> 42:44.625
Talk to you.

43:02.340 --> 43:04.900
Alicia.

43:06.150 --> 43:08.004
How are you?

43:08.980 --> 43:11.983
IfI ran... what's the plan?
