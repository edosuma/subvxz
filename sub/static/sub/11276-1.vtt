Hi, everybody.

ALL:              
              Hey.              
          Hey, Sam.

00:09.300 --> 00:10.500
Where is Rebecca?

00:10.500 --> 00:11.800
In her office. Why?

00:11.800 --> 00:14.600
Ah, today's the day a certain  
 chestnut brown-haired beauty

00:14.700 --> 00:17.900
is gonna succumb to 
            the charms of Sammy.

00:17.900 --> 00:20.600
( <i>laughing</i> )

00:20.600 --> 00:23.100
Laugh if you will, but according
to my calculations,

00:23.100 --> 00:24.300
the timing is perfect.

00:24.400 --> 00:26.900
I waited long enough for her    
to get over Evan Drake,

00:26.900 --> 00:28.200
but not long enough for her

00:28.200 --> 00:30.500
to build up                     
her resistance again.

00:30.500 --> 00:32.400
The way I see it,

00:32.400 --> 00:33.400
I got about a half-hour

00:33.400 --> 00:35.000
window of opportunity           
opening up here.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.000
I'm telling you, boys,          
Rebecca Howe is mine.

( <i>mimicking trumpet</i> )

00:46.500 --> 00:47.500
Yes?

00:47.500 --> 00:50.000
Ooh, he's got her saying, 
      "yes," already, ooh!

00:52.200 --> 00:54.100
Not a devout

02:10.000 --> 02:11.500
So what you got there?

02:11.600 --> 02:13.600
A Mercedes catalog.
            Oh.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.200
I'm thinking    
                of getting one.

02:15.200 --> 02:17.300
Yeah, I hear good things        
about those Cadillacs.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.600
What, you got a raise      
         or something?

02:20.600 --> 02:21.700
No.

02:21.700 --> 02:23.200
I can only afford           
      the cheapest model,

02:23.200 --> 02:25.900
and I have to give up lunches  
        until I...

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Well, I have to give up lunches.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.400
But it will still be a Mercedes.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.700
Speaking of Mercedes.

02:31.700 --> 02:35.500
I'm kind of known           
    as the Mercedes of guys.

02:35.500 --> 02:36.900
Really?

02:36.900 --> 02:39.000
I always thought you were       
     more of a cheap pickup

02:39.100 --> 02:40.900
with a headlight missing.

02:41.600 --> 02:43.900
Did you want   
                 something, Sam?

02:43.900 --> 02:45.300
Rebecca...

02:45.300 --> 02:47.000
how long have we                
known each other?

02:47.000 --> 02:48.800
No, I will not  
                go out with you.

02:48.800 --> 02:50.500
Hey, what...

02:50.500 --> 02:52.700
what makes you think that       
I was gonna ask you for a date?

02:52.700 --> 02:54.100
You must really think      
     you look hot tonight.

02:54.200 --> 02:56.200
Then why did you come in here?

02:56.300 --> 02:57.500
Well, I was, uh...

02:57.500 --> 02:58.900
gonna compliment you      
        on your blouse.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.700
That's a very pretty blouse.

03:00.700 --> 03:02.600
Well, we haven't seen each
      other today until now.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.900
How did you know I'd
            be wearing this one?

03:05.000 --> 03:07.100
I was hoping          
    you were gonna wear it.

03:07.100 --> 03:09.100
It's always been        
      my favorite blouse.

03:09.100 --> 03:11.200
It's brand-new; it's      
  the first time I've worn it.

03:11.200 --> 03:13.100
I'm working part-time      
 in department store security.

03:13.200 --> 03:15.400
I was in the store        
      when you bought it.

03:15.500 --> 03:16.700
I bought it mail order.

03:16.700 --> 03:19.100
I drove the truck               
that delivered it to your house.

03:19.200 --> 03:21.200
One date-- come on, please?

03:21.200 --> 03:22.500
What, is this gonna kill you?

03:22.600 --> 03:24.200
Men. You're all alike.

03:24.200 --> 03:25.800
Nothing but users, and takers,

03:25.800 --> 03:28.100
and big, stupid jerks,          
who don't even know you exist

03:28.200 --> 03:31.400
and then go running off to Japan
    with someone else.

03:33.700 --> 03:37.600
That is such a cliché.

03:37.600 --> 03:39.400
Come on, please.
Forget it.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.700
I'm concentrating on my career.

03:41.700 --> 03:45.100
I happen to think I
             have a real future 
             with this company.

03:45.100 --> 03:49.300
No offense, but... why?

03:49.400 --> 03:50.600
Because I think it's my time.

03:50.700 --> 03:53.300
You know, Evan took a lot       
of key people with him to Japan.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.000
And the way I figure it,

03:55.100 --> 03:58.300
everyone who knows    
          I'm a washout is gone.

03:58.400 --> 03:59.600
Ooh.

03:59.600 --> 04:01.200
Talk about sitting pretty.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.400
You bet.

04:02.500 --> 04:04.600
You know, the new executive
     vice president, Mr. Stone

04:04.700 --> 04:05.900
has been doing        
          a little housecleaning

04:06.000 --> 04:07.300
at the corporate level.

04:07.400 --> 04:08.600
From where I am,

04:08.700 --> 04:10.800
it could be just a     
         short climb to the top.

04:10.800 --> 04:12.900
Yeah, speaking of climbing

04:12.900 --> 04:15.000
to the top,                     
the way I see it,

04:15.000 --> 04:16.700
you haven't had a date          
with a guy

04:16.700 --> 04:17.899
for about two and half years.

04:17.899 --> 04:20.500
Now, I think this date of ours  
could be good for me,

04:20.500 --> 04:21.600
but, sweetheart, I got to say,

04:21.600 --> 04:23.700
it's looking real necessary     
for you.

04:24.500 --> 04:25.800
Sam, no.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.300
We're starting to   
            become good friends.

04:27.300 --> 04:29.000
Now, why wreck that?
Why not...

04:29.100 --> 04:31.900
Friends tell friends who they   
think they ought to go out with,

04:31.900 --> 04:33.300
and as a friend,                
I'm telling you,

04:33.400 --> 04:35.900
you ought to give               
this Malone guy a chance.

04:37.400 --> 04:41.200
( <i>choking back words</i> )

04:41.200 --> 04:42.500
( <i>sighing</i> )                     
              All right.

04:43.600 --> 04:44.900
What?

04:44.900 --> 04:47.200
I'll go out with you.

04:47.300 --> 04:49.100
That is great.

04:49.100 --> 04:50.200
That's great, all right.

04:50.200 --> 04:53.000
Um, I'll pick you up...

04:53.100 --> 04:55.900
But just, uh, for future        
reference here,

04:55.900 --> 04:58.300
uh, what did I do right         
this time?

04:58.300 --> 05:00.000
It's just that         
     since Evan went away,

05:00.100 --> 05:02.200
my expectations are low.

05:03.700 --> 05:06.400
And with my stove on the blink 
and nothing on the tube tonight,

05:06.400 --> 05:09.500
I figured... why not?

05:12.500 --> 05:13.600
Thanks.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.400
Yeah, I'll have         
    to remember that.

05:17.300 --> 05:19.100
8:00?                       
                        Okay.

05:19.100 --> 05:21.800
Oh, a-and let's just keep this 
          between us.

05:21.800 --> 05:23.200
I don't want          
     those bozos out there

05:23.300 --> 05:24.700
turning this into a circus.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.900
No, no.             
I couldn't agree with you more.

05:28.800 --> 05:31.900

05:45.900 --> 05:48.100
Sammy, you might as well

05:48.200 --> 05:50.800
make that entry in  
            your diary right now

05:50.800 --> 05:53.800
because no mortal woman     
    can resist this package.

No, no, we're     
        just having dinner.

Uh-ho!          
                NORM:           
                Oh, right, yeah.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.500
Columbus was just going on
      a little boat ride, huh?

06:00.600 --> 06:03.800
Oh, it turns out                
that's true, Norm.

06:05.800 --> 06:08.000
He told the missus he was just  
stepping out for lunch,

06:08.000 --> 06:09.900
and, uh, took a left            
instead of a right

06:10.000 --> 06:12.700
at the Isle of, uh, Langerhans, 
and before you know it,

uh, he's trading trinkets       
for Miami Beach.

06:16.100 --> 06:17.900
Cliff, you should write a book.

          Why, thank you, Carla.

06:20.300 --> 06:22.400
No, I mean right now.

06:24.500 --> 06:25.500
I mean it.

06:25.600 --> 06:29.100
Look, here's a pencil           
and some paper.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.400
Go on in the back room,

06:30.500 --> 06:33.900

  until you have 60,000 words.

                    I'll be     
                    right there.

06:56.800 --> 06:57.900
Ah, look at that.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
That really takes me back,      
you know?

07:00.100 --> 07:01.800
I remember my first date    
          with Vera--

07:01.800 --> 07:04.800
the flowers, the candy,     
        the wine.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.200
Sounds pretty romantic, Norm.

07:06.200 --> 07:07.500
Yeah, it was.

07:07.500 --> 07:08.700
You know, in retrospect,

07:08.700 --> 07:11.700
I suppose I should have gotten 
 <i>her</i> something, but, uh...

07:13.100 --> 07:15.500
I guess you can't           
 turn back that clock, can you?

( <i>door opens</i> )

07:16.900 --> 07:18.100
Ah.

07:18.100 --> 07:19.600
There you go.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.100
I just, uh,                     
brought these in

07:21.100 --> 07:24.200
so they could see what a real  
 long-stem beauty looks like.

07:24.300 --> 07:25.600

                 Thank you, Sam.

07:25.600 --> 07:27.400
Ah. Shall we go?

07:27.400 --> 07:28.600
It's just dinner.

07:28.700 --> 07:30.200
Yeah, dinner,          
    right, absolutely.

07:30.300 --> 07:32.600

Who's him?                      
It's him, Greg Stone,

07:40.300 --> 07:41.200
the new exec VP.

07:41.300 --> 07:43.600
I saw his picture in   
         the company newsletter.

07:43.600 --> 07:44.700
Mr. Stone!

07:44.800 --> 07:46.300
Welcome, welcome.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.100
It's such an honor              
to have you here.

07:48.100 --> 07:49.600
Mr. Stone,                      
I'd like you to meet

07:49.700 --> 07:50.600
Sam Malone.
Yeah, hi.

07:50.600 --> 07:51.800
Pleased to meet you, Sam.

07:51.900 --> 07:53.000
Yeah.

07:53.100 --> 07:54.100
Who are you?

07:54.200 --> 07:55.700
Rebecca Howe.

07:55.700 --> 07:57.100
I'm the manager.

07:57.100 --> 07:59.400
Ah, of course.

07:59.500 --> 08:01.800
I'd like to use your
            phone if I may.

08:01.900 --> 08:04.100
You can do anything    
         you want with my phone.

08:04.200 --> 08:05.400
Thank you...   
                 For the moment,

08:05.500 --> 08:07.600
I thought I'd just
              speak into it.

08:07.700 --> 08:08.800
Good choice.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.500
Okay, come on.                  
Let's go.

08:10.500 --> 08:12.300
Sweetheart,                     
we're gonna be late. Let's...

08:12.300 --> 08:13.600
He could very well be

08:13.700 --> 08:16.000
the most handsome man      
    I have ever seen.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.200
( <i>patrons groaning</i> )

08:18.300 --> 08:20.600
And did you see the way
         he looked in my eyes

08:20.600 --> 08:22.200
when he said, 
                  "Who are you?"

08:22.300 --> 08:23.900
I think he      
                really likes me.

08:23.900 --> 08:25.100
We all do, honey.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.300
Now, let's go.

08:26.400 --> 08:27.700
No, Sam, you don't
              understand.

08:27.800 --> 08:29.700
He's the man I've been
          giving my accounts to 
          the last couple weeks.

08:29.700 --> 08:31.600
I think he could be    
         my ticket to corporate.

08:31.600 --> 08:32.600
( <i>door opens</i> )

08:32.700 --> 08:34.700
Miss Howe, I'd like to see you 
          in my office

08:34.700 --> 08:35.900
tomorrow morning at 9:00.

08:35.900 --> 08:37.100
Mm-hmm.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.500
What'd I tell you?  
            What did I tell you?
Yeah, that's great.

08:39.600 --> 08:40.799
Now, let's go celebrate,        
all right?

08:40.799 --> 08:42.200
Oh, excuse me, 
                 excuse me, sir!

08:42.200 --> 08:44.200
Listen, as long as you were
     gonna tell me anyway,

08:44.300 --> 08:46.300
why don't you just go 
          ahead and tell me now?

08:46.400 --> 08:48.600
This is not the time            
or the place.

08:48.600 --> 08:50.100
Oh, please tell me.

08:50.100 --> 08:51.600
You've been going   
            over my files?

08:51.600 --> 08:53.000
Yes, I have.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.000
And we're doing better?

08:55.100 --> 08:56.400
Yes, we're doing better.

08:56.400 --> 08:57.400
Well, then what's   
            the problem?

08:57.500 --> 08:59.000
Just go ahead and tell me.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.100
I really think we should        
discuss this privately.

09:01.200 --> 09:04.100
Pal, just between   
            us guys here,

09:04.200 --> 09:05.600
do me a favor and tell her.

09:05.700 --> 09:09.200
It'd kind of help               
grease the old skids.

09:09.300 --> 09:11.900
I really don't think.      
         Sir, excuse me, please?

09:11.900 --> 09:13.000
Please?

09:13.100 --> 09:15.600
Very well, Ms. Howe,  
             if you insist.

09:15.700 --> 09:18.900
This, uh, quarter has shown   
     a slight improvement.

09:18.900 --> 09:19.900
Did you hear that,
              everybody?

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
"A slight improvement."

09:22.100 --> 09:23.400
STONE:                          
But the records show,

09:23.400 --> 09:25.500
unequivocally,         
    that the bar did better

09:25.600 --> 09:27.800
under Sam's direction      
          than yours.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.000
In view of this,

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
I'm hereby appointing Sam       
        the new manager.

09:32.100 --> 09:33.400
And I regret to say

09:33.500 --> 09:35.400
I'm forced to give you notice.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.700
I'm sorry.

09:37.800 --> 09:40.300
Okay, boys, dessert.

09:49.400 --> 09:52.500
Well, what do you say we go     
strap on the ol' feedbag, huh?

09:55.700 --> 09:58.900
You coming?

09:58.900 --> 09:59.900
Uh...

10:00.000 --> 10:02.600
you guys want to help me
        get her into the car?

10:05.700 --> 10:07.300
I'll get the door.

10:10.300 --> 10:12.800
This is gonna be a lot easier   
than I thought.

10:24.600 --> 10:25.800
Two Amstel Lights.        
I don't know, Carla.

10:25.900 --> 10:27.900
Either managing a bar is getting

10:27.900 --> 10:29.700
a lot more complicated,

10:29.700 --> 10:31.500
or I'm getting a lot dumber.

10:31.500 --> 10:35.000
You couldn't be getting
         any dumber, Sam.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.600
Well, it must be                
that other thing.

10:37.600 --> 10:39.400
You know, having  
              you back in charge

10:39.400 --> 10:41.400
really reminds me of
            old times, you know?

10:41.500 --> 10:43.400
I mean, real old times.

10:43.400 --> 10:45.100
Even before the evil days,

10:45.100 --> 10:47.700
when darkness          
      fell over the earth.

10:48.800 --> 10:51.200
She means when          
        Diane was still here.

10:51.200 --> 10:55.900
I know precisely                
what she means.

10:55.900 --> 10:57.500
( <i>phone rings</i> )

10:57.500 --> 10:59.600
Cheers.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.600
Sam, it's Mr. Stone for you.

11:01.600 --> 11:03.300
Uh, put him on hold there,      
             Woody.

11:03.300 --> 11:04.400
Damn, I'll bet

11:04.400 --> 11:06.200
he wants those figures.

11:15.300 --> 11:16.400
Hello, Woody.

11:18.800 --> 11:19.900
Miss Howe?

11:19.900 --> 11:21.300
Woody, where's Sam?

11:21.300 --> 11:22.200
In his off...

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
Oh, I mean, in your...

11:24.900 --> 11:25.800
In your...

11:27.800 --> 11:29.800
I-I haven't seen him.

11:35.100 --> 11:36.900
Hello.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.600
Love your hairdo.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.900
Sweetheart,     
                what happened?

12:03.900 --> 12:08.800
I just had to knock             
on my own office door.

12:08.800 --> 12:11.100
Honey, I-I'm so sorry.

12:11.100 --> 12:13.500
I swear to God 
                 I didn't want  
                 this to happen.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.100
I know.

12:15.100 --> 12:17.500
It's not your fault.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.800
I know why it happened.

12:19.800 --> 12:22.500
Because I'm a loser.

12:22.500 --> 12:25.600
I always have been,       
      and I always will be

12:25.600 --> 12:29.900
a big old, fat, old,      
         stupid loser.

12:29.900 --> 12:31.200
No, you're not a loser.

12:31.200 --> 12:32.700
Don't say that,
                 you hear me?

12:32.700 --> 12:34.000
You are not a loser.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.200
Okay.

12:35.200 --> 12:40.600
You have a barrette    
         for this, or something?

12:40.700 --> 12:43.900
I lost it.

12:43.900 --> 12:47.000
Sweetheart,            
         don't worry about...   
         don't worry about that.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.800
It'll be all right.

12:48.800 --> 12:51.200
Hey, you know what might
        make you feel better?

12:51.200 --> 12:53.000
We never had that   
            date, you know?

12:53.100 --> 12:55.300
Oh, God!

12:57.300 --> 12:59.300
You just go    
                 back over there

12:59.300 --> 13:01.100
and do whatever it 
             was you were doing,

13:01.100 --> 13:03.500
and I will get out      
        of your life forever.

Rebecca, I...   
    Sam, please.

13:05.700 --> 13:07.700
It'll make it a lot easier.

You know,

13:15.400 --> 13:18.300
I might just become a bag lady.

It really could.

13:32.200 --> 13:33.000
for the rest of my things.

is still on hold.

          on the double.

13:53.900 --> 13:58.000

but it looks like Donkey Kong.

Oh, man, that,
                  that stinks.

It's not like it used to
        be around here, Carla.

14:04.200 --> 14:06.800
I mean corporations,
            computers, reports.

14:06.800 --> 14:09.600
I mean, I used to keep
          track of inventory

14:09.600 --> 14:12.100
in a spiral notebook,           
for God's sake.

14:12.100 --> 14:13.300
No, you didn't.

14:13.300 --> 14:14.800
Well, I always meant to.

14:17.700 --> 14:19.600
You know, I-I just      
        hate being in charge.

14:19.700 --> 14:21.000
I'm not good at it.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.300
Rebecca wasn't good at it       
            either,

14:22.400 --> 14:23.900
but at least she enjoyed it.

14:23.900 --> 14:26.700
You know,               
 I'm going to go back to Stone,

14:26.700 --> 14:29.200
and I'm going to beg him        
to give her this job back.

14:29.200 --> 14:30.600
No, wait a minute.

14:30.700 --> 14:33.000
You're quitting         
        because of this machine?

14:33.100 --> 14:34.900
Carla, I hate that machine.

14:34.900 --> 14:37.400
John Henry hated a machine, too.

14:37.400 --> 14:40.500
Do you know the story      
      of John Henry, Sam?

14:40.600 --> 14:43.800
He went toe to toe with a   
    steel-driving machine,

14:43.800 --> 14:45.700
and he refused to admit

14:45.700 --> 14:47.400
that that machine           
      was better than him.

14:47.500 --> 14:48.700
And do you know what happened?

14:48.700 --> 14:50.100
Yeah, the machine               
beat him.

14:50.100 --> 14:52.200
His heart exploded;             
he died.

14:52.200 --> 14:55.100
He did?

14:55.100 --> 14:58.100
Yes.

14:58.100 --> 15:00.600
Well, go get her job back   
    before you lose your ticker.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.200
Go on.

15:08.100 --> 15:09.600
Whoa, how'd it go?

15:09.600 --> 15:13.500
Oh, Woody, Woody, give me       
a seltzer there, will you?

15:13.600 --> 15:16.100
Mr. Stone is dead set   
        against rehiring her,

15:16.200 --> 15:18.400
and I hate to beg       
        when sex isn't involved.

15:21.300 --> 15:22.900
So, what happened?

15:22.900 --> 15:24.600
Well, I had to promise
          that she'd agree

15:24.700 --> 15:26.100
to a whole list
                 of conditions,

15:26.100 --> 15:27.900
but he finally said yes.

15:27.900 --> 15:29.200
I left a message

15:29.200 --> 15:31.400
on her answering machine        
that I wanted to talk to her.

15:31.500 --> 15:32.900
What are you      
              going to tell her?

15:32.900 --> 15:35.200
I'm going to tell her           
to take her stupid job back.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.400
I don't want it anymore.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.100
Wait a minute, Sam.
             Aren't you missing 
             something here?

15:38.200 --> 15:40.200
What?

15:40.200 --> 15:43.400
You desperately want to jump
    this woman's bones, right?

15:43.400 --> 15:44.900
Sure.

15:44.900 --> 15:47.400
And you've just arranged
        something for her

15:47.500 --> 15:49.900
that she wants more than   
     anything else in the world.

15:49.900 --> 15:51.300
So?

15:51.400 --> 15:54.700
Don't you see a connection
      between those two things?

15:56.900 --> 15:58.400
Breaks your heart,
              doesn't it?

16:00.600 --> 16:03.900
You tell Rebecca  
              that you loved    
              being the manager,

16:03.900 --> 16:06.500
but you couldn't   
             stand to see her   
             being so miserable,

16:06.500 --> 16:08.000
so you got her
                  her job back.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.500
Next thing you know,

16:09.600 --> 16:11.700
she'll be doing     
            the backstroke on   
            your water bed.

16:14.400 --> 16:17.200
Carla, I'm shocked.

16:17.200 --> 16:20.400
Why, 'cause you didn't
          think of it first?

16:20.400 --> 16:23.000
Yeah. I mean,                   
I must be losing it.

16:25.300 --> 16:26.400
Woody, uh,

16:26.400 --> 16:27.500
call Melville's.

16:27.600 --> 16:29.400
Tell them I want an 8:00        
reservation for two.

16:29.500 --> 16:31.000
Oh, and tell them               
that I want

16:31.000 --> 16:33.600
booth number five,              
chill their best champagne,

16:33.600 --> 16:37.900
yeah, and order                 
a chocolate soufflé for dessert.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.200
Aw, gee, Sam, that sounds good,

16:40.200 --> 16:42.100
but actually,          
      I brought my dinner.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.700
Woody...                        
make the reservation.

16:48.900 --> 16:50.100
All right, but this is a waste

16:50.200 --> 16:52.500
of a perfectly good       
      meatball sandwich.

16:53.600 --> 16:54.900
Thank you.

16:58.900 --> 17:02.200
Sam, I can't thank you enough   
for getting my job back.

17:02.200 --> 17:05.700
I finally feel good             
about myself again.

17:05.700 --> 17:08.000
You know, the first thing I did 
when I got home

17:08.000 --> 17:11.099
was I-I put in an order         
for that Mercedes.

17:11.099 --> 17:12.599
Ah, well, I think   
            you'll look great

17:12.599 --> 17:14.300
wearing one of those.

17:14.400 --> 17:15.900
So...

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
you having a good time?

17:18.000 --> 17:19.200
Yeah, I actually am.

17:19.200 --> 17:21.300
Well, you don't have to sound  
         so surprised.

17:21.300 --> 17:23.200
Oh, I'm sorry;         
  I didn't mean it like that.

17:23.300 --> 17:25.000
( <i>sighing</i> ):          
    It's just that...

17:25.000 --> 17:27.400
with all your obnoxious     
come-ons, and everything,

17:27.500 --> 17:30.600
I never expected you to be as...

17:31.800 --> 17:34.600
as charming           
    as you've been tonight.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.500
No kidding.

17:36.500 --> 17:41.800
So, what do you find
            charming about me?

17:41.800 --> 17:44.800
Well, for one thing,      
    I find it charming

17:44.800 --> 17:48.600
that you would try to impress me
by ordering an elegant soufflé,

17:48.600 --> 17:51.100
when I know perfectly well      
that your favorite dessert

17:51.100 --> 17:52.800
is frozen Snicker bars.

17:52.800 --> 17:56.000
Actually, they're   
            in the bottom

17:56.000 --> 17:57.700
of your champagne   
            bucket there.

17:57.700 --> 17:59.100
( <i>chuckling</i> )

17:59.100 --> 18:02.100
Oh, I think I was  
             just charming again
             there, wasn't I?

18:05.200 --> 18:06.500
I don't get it.

18:07.600 --> 18:09.300
Just when I thought       
    I had you pegged,

18:09.300 --> 18:11.500
you go out and do something   
      like you did today.

18:11.500 --> 18:13.000
Sam,

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
that really was the nicest thing

18:15.000 --> 18:17.500
that anyone           
     has ever done for me.

18:17.500 --> 18:22.300
Well, you deserve to have   
    nice things done for you.

18:22.400 --> 18:24.000
You're a very nice person.

18:24.100 --> 18:26.400
So are you.

18:35.600 --> 18:37.400
Sam?

18:37.500 --> 18:38.800
Yeah?

18:38.800 --> 18:40.700
Is that your hand on my leg?

18:40.700 --> 18:42.400
Oh, I'll be darned.

18:42.400 --> 18:46.200
My left hand does seem to   
    be missing, doesn't it?

18:46.200 --> 18:48.100
Do you want me to move it?

18:48.100 --> 18:50.100
Yes.

18:51.300 --> 18:54.600
That's not what I meant.

18:54.600 --> 18:58.400
Oh, thank you, God.

19:01.400 --> 19:04.400
Ah! Mr. Stone! Hi!

19:04.500 --> 19:05.900
What a surprise!

19:06.000 --> 19:07.200
Oh, good evening.

19:07.200 --> 19:10.300
I wonder if we      
            could have the      
            table over there?

19:10.300 --> 19:12.400
Mr. Stone,                      
I'm not the hostess.

19:12.400 --> 19:15.000
I'm Rebecca Howe,               
from downstairs.

19:15.100 --> 19:16.800
Ah, yeah, of   
                 course you are.

19:16.800 --> 19:18.300
Miss Howe.

19:18.400 --> 19:20.900
I guess I ought to
              say welcome back.

19:20.900 --> 19:24.400
I was a little surprised
        you agreed to the       
        conditions, but if you

19:24.400 --> 19:25.800
can live with   
                them, so can we.

19:25.800 --> 19:27.000
Ah, here's    
                  the maitre d'.

19:27.000 --> 19:31.100
I wonder if I could
             have that table    
             in the other room?

19:31.100 --> 19:33.100
Nice to see
                     you again.

19:38.200 --> 19:40.100
What was he                     
talking about?

19:40.100 --> 19:41.800
What conditions?

19:41.800 --> 19:43.700
You want some  
                 more champagne?

19:43.700 --> 19:45.900
Sam, what conditions?

19:45.900 --> 19:49.500
Well, they were         
    so insignificant,

19:49.600 --> 19:51.900
they really     
                slipped my mind.

19:53.000 --> 19:58.600
Uh, all right, uh.

19:58.600 --> 19:59.900
Well, uh...

19:59.900 --> 20:03.700
You have to take   
             a... slight pay cut

20:03.700 --> 20:06.000
and go back to school   
        for your MBA

20:06.000 --> 20:07.900
and share the  
                 office with me,

20:07.900 --> 20:09.800
consult with me on  
            all major decisions,

20:09.800 --> 20:11.800
and since you lack any
          practical experience,

20:11.900 --> 20:13.900
you'll have to  
                wait tables when
                the bar is busy,

20:13.900 --> 20:17.000
which will put you      
        under the immediate     
        supervision of Carla.

20:19.400 --> 20:22.700
Any wonder it   
                slipped my mind?

20:22.700 --> 20:26.100
Sam, uh, when were you planning 
      on telling me this?

20:26.100 --> 20:29.500
After.

20:29.600 --> 20:32.500
After what?

20:32.500 --> 20:35.300
Afterwards.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.000
All right, um.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.500
I'm sorry, I should     
        have told you, but...

20:43.500 --> 20:46.500
I just thought that     
        you'd been going through
        such a tough time

20:46.600 --> 20:48.000
that you deserved 
              at least one night

20:48.000 --> 20:50.100
of feeling good
                 about yourself.

20:51.900 --> 20:53.400
All right, I'll
                 call you a cab.

20:53.400 --> 20:54.500
No, no, no.

20:54.600 --> 20:56.600
It's okay.

20:56.600 --> 20:59.600
The important thing       
  is that I have my job back.

20:59.700 --> 21:02.000
You're not upset
                about this?

21:02.100 --> 21:03.800
No, how can I be upset

21:03.800 --> 21:06.600
when I have so much       
      to be thankful for?

21:06.600 --> 21:11.900
Now... where were we?

21:12.000 --> 21:14.700
Does this look familiar?

21:14.700 --> 21:16.800
Sam?                  
                  Yeah?

21:16.900 --> 21:18.700
I want tonight                  
to be very special.

21:18.800 --> 21:20.400
Mmm.

21:20.400 --> 21:24.800
And I think I can figure        
a way out for us to do that.

21:26.700 --> 21:28.500
You see, I have this fantasy...

21:30.900 --> 21:33.000
and it's something              
that I've always wanted to try,

21:33.000 --> 21:35.600
but I didn't ever think         
that I'd get to do it

21:35.700 --> 21:37.500
until tonight.

21:37.500 --> 21:39.400
Would you like to know          
what it is?

21:39.400 --> 21:42.400
Yes, please.

21:42.400 --> 21:45.100
Okay.

21:45.100 --> 21:47.400
Well, you see,                  
I have this hot tub at home.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.700
I love the way this begins.

21:49.700 --> 21:52.700
And what we do                  
when we get there...

21:56.700 --> 21:58.300
First?

21:58.400 --> 21:59.400
Uh-huh.

21:59.500 --> 22:00.600
And then...

22:02.600 --> 22:04.800
Oh, God.

22:04.900 --> 22:07.200
Oh, please.

22:07.300 --> 22:08.700
A-a-a-and this is the part

22:08.800 --> 22:10.500
that's just                     
a little tiny bit illegal.

22:11.800 --> 22:13.000
No, no, no, no, no.

22:13.100 --> 22:15.200
Oh, I don't think               
that I should tell you.

22:15.300 --> 22:17.500
I really think it would     
be better if I showed you.

22:17.600 --> 22:20.100
Come with me now,               
so we don't spoil the mood.

22:20.100 --> 22:25.100
Could you just give me a minute?

22:25.100 --> 22:27.700
No.

22:30.500 --> 22:32.500
Bye-bye, Sam.

22:41.100 --> 22:42.800
Can I get you anything
          else, Mr. Malone?

22:42.800 --> 22:44.800
No, thank you, Paul.

22:44.800 --> 22:47.900
Actually, Paul,

22:48.000 --> 22:51.500
could I have another one    
  of your chocolate soufflés?

22:51.500 --> 22:53.900
Are you aware          
that will take 45 minutes?

22:54.000 --> 22:57.100
Yes, Paul, I am.

23:02.400 --> 23:03.500
Woody,

23:03.500 --> 23:05.900
Sam's going                     
to be upstairs for a while.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.700
When he comes down,             
give him this message.

23:07.800 --> 23:10.300
You tell him that it will be    
a cold day in hell

23:10.300 --> 23:12.100
before I ever share an office   
with him,

23:12.100 --> 23:15.500
or schlep drinks                
in a two-bit saloon.

23:15.500 --> 23:16.500
Oh, Miss Howe?

23:16.600 --> 23:18.500
By the way, Midtown
             Mercedes called,

23:18.500 --> 23:21.100
and they said you can       
    pick up your car anytime.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.700
Oh, and they got the one        
you wanted-- the red one.

23:27.100 --> 23:28.300
The red one?

23:33.800 --> 23:34.800
Hi, there.

23:34.800 --> 23:36.400
My name's Rebecca...

23:36.500 --> 23:41.700
( <i>voice breaking</i> ):       
and it will be my pleasure      
         to serve you.
