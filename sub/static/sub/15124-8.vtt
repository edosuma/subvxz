WEBVTT

00:03.504 --> 00:05.539
I am proud to announce
that this Saturday,

00:05.573 --> 00:08.176
Howdy's will be teaming up
with the Natesville Radishes

00:08.209 --> 00:11.645
to sponsor the first annual
1K Walk to Fight ABS--

00:11.679 --> 00:13.247
Angry Bowel Syndrome.

00:13.281 --> 00:15.716
Now, ABS. is similar to
Irritable Bowel Syndrome,

00:15.749 --> 00:17.751
except your bowels are
in a blind rage.

00:17.785 --> 00:20.354
And we're lucky
to have Ricardo Montes

00:20.388 --> 00:21.489
as our spokesman.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.357
Together we can
make a difference.

00:23.391 --> 00:26.427
ABS may not be the number one
bowel disorder in the world,

00:26.460 --> 00:28.362
but it's rapidly pushing
number two.

00:28.396 --> 00:31.399
Is that true, Barney,
or is it just a load of crap?

00:31.432 --> 00:32.400
(employees laugh)

00:32.433 --> 00:34.602
Hey, hey, hey,
no brown humor.

00:34.635 --> 00:36.204
Poopy jokes
are too easy.

00:36.237 --> 00:38.506
Angry Bowel Syndrome
can affect anybody.

00:38.539 --> 00:41.509
Your father, your mother,
even your boss.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.144
That's right, your boss.

00:43.177 --> 00:45.146
And it's because of
behavior like this

00:45.179 --> 00:46.847
that I suffered
in silence for years.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.517
Sadly, I was too embarrassed
to make a stink about it.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.552
(laughter)

00:51.585 --> 00:52.720
I'll walk the 1K.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.724
And you guys should be
ashamed of yourselves.

00:56.757 --> 00:58.359
Barney's up here
courageously admitting

00:58.392 --> 01:00.228
that he has
a serious condition,

01:00.261 --> 01:01.629
and you guys are
acting like children.

01:01.662 --> 01:03.197
Thank you, James.

01:03.231 --> 01:04.465
At least there's someone here
that knows

01:04.498 --> 01:06.367
that ABS
is nothing to joke about.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.401
We need

01:07.435 --> 01:08.636
to voice our support

01:08.669 --> 01:10.238
because silence can be deadly.

01:10.271 --> 01:12.273
(snorts)
The fight against
ABS will get

01:12.306 --> 01:14.475
the push it deserves
to finally make a big splash.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.210
Sufferers of
this condition

01:16.244 --> 01:18.446
are tired of hiding like turtles
in their shells.

01:18.479 --> 01:20.581
It's time for this turtle's head
to poke out.

01:20.614 --> 01:23.551
(employees snickering)
Barney, you're not doing
yourself any favors.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.419
Uh... Ricardo.

01:25.453 --> 01:27.221
Could you please stop
pinching that loaf?

01:27.255 --> 01:28.856
(employees laugh)
Oh, come on.
Seriously?

01:32.593 --> 01:34.595
* Whoo!

01:34.628 --> 01:38.399
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh

01:38.432 --> 01:41.569
* Daddy-o, oh, oh, oh

01:41.602 --> 01:43.904
* Birth control, no, no, no

01:43.937 --> 01:47.475
* Let it roll, oh, oh, oh

01:47.508 --> 01:49.810
* Oh

01:49.843 --> 01:51.812
* Oh...

01:51.845 --> 01:54.582
* Whoo

01:54.615 --> 01:56.484
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh

01:56.517 --> 01:58.886
* Oh, oh, oh!

02:03.191 --> 02:04.658
Ooh, hot potato,
hot potato.

02:04.692 --> 02:07.528
What have the Japanese done
to our potatoes?!

02:07.561 --> 02:09.663
We're just playing
a game, Maw Maw.

02:09.697 --> 02:12.166
Whoever's holding that thing
when it lights up loses.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.335
Oh, my God, Jimmy,
you totally missed it.

02:14.368 --> 02:15.336
Later, in the stock room,

02:15.369 --> 02:16.337
Frank asked Barney if there was

02:16.370 --> 02:17.371
gonna be child care provided

02:17.405 --> 02:18.506
at the 1K because

02:18.539 --> 02:19.507
his cousin
wanted to drop

02:19.540 --> 02:20.941
her kids off at the pool.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.810
VIRGINIA:
Look, I can see

02:22.843 --> 02:25.313
how lots of diseases
are easy to joke about.

02:25.346 --> 02:26.614
But this isn't some disorder

02:26.647 --> 02:28.449
that makes you walk
or talk funny--

02:28.482 --> 02:30.451
this is Angry Bowel Syndrome.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.320
It's not a laughing matter.

02:32.353 --> 02:33.854
I hope you weren't
making jokes, Jimmy.

02:33.887 --> 02:36.324
Oh, I wasn't. I said I would be
in his charity walk.

02:36.357 --> 02:37.858
Good! And I hope
you stood right up

02:37.891 --> 02:40.794
and told everyone
that you suffered from it.

02:40.828 --> 02:43.264
You had ABS?

02:43.297 --> 02:46.200
JABS--
Juvenile Angry Bowel Syndrome.

02:46.234 --> 02:48.569
No, surprisingly, I didn't tell
my coworkers and my fiancÃ©e

02:48.602 --> 02:50.638
that I used to
almost poop my pants.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.373
Yeah. "Almost."

02:52.406 --> 02:53.807
I'm fine now.
It was a problem

02:53.841 --> 02:54.875
when I was younger,
and the school nurse

02:54.908 --> 02:55.843
said it was stress-related.

02:55.876 --> 02:57.378
Mostly because my parents

02:57.411 --> 02:59.513
made me be the tiebreaker
in their arguments.

02:59.547 --> 03:00.881
Gas bill.
Electric bill.

03:00.914 --> 03:02.816
We can only afford
to pay one.
(sighs)

03:02.850 --> 03:03.984
Jimmy, you decide.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.686
Electric bill.
Gas bill.

03:05.719 --> 03:07.488
Electric bill.
Gas bill.

03:07.521 --> 03:08.856
Gas bill!
Electric bill!

03:10.324 --> 03:12.360
(stomach gurgles)
My tummy hurts.

03:12.393 --> 03:13.727
Jelly!
Glazed!

03:13.761 --> 03:15.529
Jimmy, you decide what
we're having for dinner.

03:15.563 --> 03:16.530
Jelly.
Glazed.

03:16.564 --> 03:17.765
Glazed.
Jelly.

03:17.798 --> 03:18.832
Jelly.
Glazed.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.834
I think I got to poop.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.703
BURT:
Come on! We'll take a bus

03:22.736 --> 03:24.705
down to L.A., grab
a big-screen TV,

03:24.738 --> 03:26.006
and we'll come
right home.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.008
The riots aren't
real, Burt!

03:28.041 --> 03:29.710
It's a TV show.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.512
Remember when I
changed the drapes

03:31.545 --> 03:33.381
and you thought
we quantum leaped?

03:33.414 --> 03:35.883
Well, I say we go.
Well, I say we don't.

03:35.916 --> 03:37.418
Jimmy, what do
you think?

03:37.451 --> 03:40.354
(stomach gurgles)
Can't we all just get along?

03:46.294 --> 03:47.895
If you two would just learn
to make a decision,

03:47.928 --> 03:49.630
I wouldn't still be
known in some circles

03:49.663 --> 03:50.798
as "Poops-His-Pants Chance."

03:50.831 --> 03:51.899
(buzzing)
Ha!

03:51.932 --> 03:52.966
You lose!

03:53.000 --> 03:53.967
No, I didn't.

03:54.001 --> 03:55.035
If it's a tie,

03:55.068 --> 03:56.804
the receiver loses.

03:56.837 --> 03:58.439
No, no, no.
We changed that rule

03:58.472 --> 03:59.873
after the incident
at the Cheesecake Warehouse.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.442
Hander-offer loses.

04:01.475 --> 04:02.876
Receiver!
Hander-offer!

04:02.910 --> 04:04.412
Jimmy, you call it.

04:04.445 --> 04:05.479
Hander-offer.
Receiver.

04:05.513 --> 04:06.480
Receiver.
Hander-offer.

04:06.514 --> 04:07.548
Hander-offer.
Receiver!

04:07.581 --> 04:08.482
Hander-offer.

04:08.516 --> 04:09.483
I gotta go to the bathroom.

04:13.821 --> 04:17.925
Oh, no, Yoshi's
working tonight.

04:19.827 --> 04:21.929
Who's Yoshi?
He's one
of the table chefs.

04:21.962 --> 04:23.397
He's totally in love
with Virginia.

04:23.431 --> 04:25.433
Every time we come here,
he gets all flirty,

04:25.466 --> 04:27.401
and it usually
catches me off guard.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.470
Shrimp for the pretty lady?

04:29.503 --> 04:30.438
Where?

04:32.773 --> 04:34.007
Shrimp for the pretty lady?

04:34.041 --> 04:35.443
(growls)
(Virginia laughs)

04:37.645 --> 04:39.580
Ooh! Hot shrimp!

04:39.613 --> 04:40.814
Hot, hot shrimp!

04:40.848 --> 04:42.650
This time I'm gonna be ready.

04:42.683 --> 04:45.686
Like a fat bridesmaid catching
the bouquet.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.657
Origami, Yoshi.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.792
Long time, no see.

04:51.825 --> 04:53.093
Ah, Chance family.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.429
So nice to serve friendly faces.

04:55.463 --> 04:57.531
So nice to have
our faces served.

05:00.734 --> 05:01.569
Oh, God.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.806
Wyatt just walked in
with his family.

05:05.839 --> 05:07.675
I haven't seen him
since we broke up.

05:07.708 --> 05:08.542
Damn it.

05:13.914 --> 05:14.948
What are you doing?

05:14.982 --> 05:16.049
Hiding.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.618
Come on.
We're all adults.

05:17.651 --> 05:18.952
It'll be fine.
Jimmy...

05:18.986 --> 05:21.355
how awkward is it gonna be
if they walk by

05:21.389 --> 05:22.856
and they see me sitting
at this table?

05:22.890 --> 05:25.959
How awkward would it be
if they sat at our table

05:25.993 --> 05:28.496
and you were under it?

05:30.531 --> 05:31.799
Look who's here.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.367
Wyatt...

05:33.401 --> 05:34.635
and your parents.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.470
How long has it been?

05:36.504 --> 05:38.972
'Cause it feels like it's
just been forever.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.409
No, just since February 13.

05:41.442 --> 05:43.143
And If I remember correctly,
Wyatt gave you

05:43.176 --> 05:45.979
flowers and chocolate
for Valentine's Day.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.548
MOTHER:
And in exchange,

05:47.581 --> 05:49.983
you crushed his heart
into a million pieces

05:50.017 --> 05:53.020
and leapt into bed with the
first buffoon to come along.

05:55.556 --> 05:57.991
In my day, they called women
like that "whores."

05:58.025 --> 06:00.761
But it never bothered me.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.672
So, Wyatt,
Wyatt's parents,

06:11.705 --> 06:13.006
Guess we were
all in the mood

06:13.040 --> 06:14.608
for Asian tonight, huh?

06:15.943 --> 06:18.479
(quietly): Was I supposed
to say "Oriental"?

06:18.512 --> 06:19.913
Shh! I'm focusing
on the shrimp.

06:19.947 --> 06:21.682
That's a nice shirt
you got there, Jimmy.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.451
Is it new
or secondhand?

06:23.484 --> 06:25.419
Because I know how you like
to get things

06:25.453 --> 06:26.420
other people
have already had.

06:26.454 --> 06:27.921
Actually,
it is secondhand.

06:27.955 --> 06:30.491
Yeah, my mom picked it up
at the thrift store.

06:30.524 --> 06:32.893
So, is the neck hole
all stretched out?

06:32.926 --> 06:35.028
That can happen
when the guy before you had

06:35.062 --> 06:36.196
a much bigger head.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.698
Oh, yeah.

06:37.731 --> 06:38.932
I mean, God knows how many guys

06:38.966 --> 06:40.200
wore this shirt before me.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.569
(quietly):
Just so you know,

06:41.602 --> 06:43.136
he's not talking
about your shirt.

06:46.507 --> 06:49.943
Oh, hey, for the record,
this shirt fits me real well.

06:49.977 --> 06:51.445
In fact, sometimes,
I like to wear this shirt

06:51.479 --> 06:52.813
two or three times a night.

06:52.846 --> 06:54.114
And sometimes, the
shirt likes it when

06:54.147 --> 06:55.048
I pull its hair
just a little bit.

06:55.082 --> 06:57.518
Okay, that's enough talk
about the shirt.

06:57.551 --> 07:01.121
I don't know if
you've ever tried on
an older shirt,

07:01.154 --> 07:03.724
but I'd be willing
to have sex with you.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.493
I didn't think
it was possible.

07:05.526 --> 07:08.095
You people have ruined
hibachi garlic-mango
salmon for me.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.530
Well, it's best
if you laid off

07:09.563 --> 07:10.931
the garlic-mango anyway,
sweetheart.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.733
I have it once a year,
and I sleep in the guest room.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.167
You got nothing
to complain about.

07:14.201 --> 07:15.769
Yoshi's dancing the shrimp.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.237
He's gonna flip it any second.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.573
By the way,
you still have some of my stuff.

07:19.607 --> 07:21.742
I want my "Brazilliant
Amazonian" hair gel back.

07:21.775 --> 07:22.910
Why don't you just buy
some more?

07:22.943 --> 07:23.977
They discontinued it.

07:24.011 --> 07:25.513
One stupid chimp dies of cancer,

07:25.546 --> 07:27.014
and my hair has
to look like crap.

07:27.047 --> 07:29.082
I'll give you
your precious hair gel back

07:29.116 --> 07:31.151
when I get
my ice cream maker back.

07:31.184 --> 07:32.920
No way! You can get
another ice cream maker,

07:32.953 --> 07:34.187
I can't get any more
Brazilliance.

07:36.824 --> 07:39.092
The lemon is in the hat.

07:39.126 --> 07:42.596
Here comes the shrimp, folks.

07:42.630 --> 07:43.931
Shrimp for the pretty lady?

07:43.964 --> 07:45.599
You betcha.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.707
(snaps fingers)

07:53.741 --> 07:55.275
So... we ordering
dessert here

07:55.308 --> 07:57.177
or are we going out
for ice cream?

08:00.881 --> 08:03.116
The whole thing is dumb
to begin with--

08:03.150 --> 08:04.818
tossing shrimp around in
this economy.

08:04.852 --> 08:07.120
Plus, he was looking at me
the whole night

08:07.154 --> 08:08.789
and then he tosses the shrimp
at her?

08:08.822 --> 08:11.291
What kind of man shrimp-teases
a woman like that?

08:11.324 --> 08:13.126
We're still on
this, I see.

08:13.160 --> 08:13.961
Because it's just rude!

08:13.994 --> 08:16.229
And why her?

08:16.263 --> 08:19.032
You don't think it's because
she's younger, do you?

08:19.066 --> 08:22.002
No. Besides, you look great
for your age.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.136
"For my age"?

08:23.170 --> 08:24.838
Wait...

08:24.872 --> 08:26.707
I'm at the "for my age" age?

08:26.740 --> 08:29.209
That's just around the corner
from "Good for you,

08:29.242 --> 08:30.978
still staying active" age.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.180
No, I mean...
(grunts)

08:33.213 --> 08:34.715
What's wrong with you?

08:34.748 --> 08:36.149
My back.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.686
Must've been those chairs
at the restaurant.

08:38.719 --> 08:42.623
Oh, my God, and you're at
the "making bad excuses

08:42.656 --> 08:43.891
for your body
falling apart" age.

08:43.924 --> 08:46.059
(sighs)

08:46.093 --> 08:47.160
Are we getting old?

08:47.194 --> 08:48.762
What? No.

08:48.796 --> 08:49.730
(back cracks)

08:49.763 --> 08:50.831
(groans, chuckles)

08:50.864 --> 08:51.732
Damn.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.166
I'm gonna get an ice pack.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.835
But that doesn't mean
I'm getting old.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.237
It's just like every
pro athlete in their prime does

08:57.270 --> 08:58.906
after they play a game...

08:58.939 --> 09:02.710
or sit in
an uncomfortable chair.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.344
You think
maybe we are getting old?

09:04.377 --> 09:07.748
I'll show you who's getting old.

09:07.781 --> 09:09.216
All right!

09:09.249 --> 09:10.183
(chuckling):
Okay!

09:10.217 --> 09:11.218
(hearty chuckle)

09:11.251 --> 09:13.086
Yeah!

09:13.120 --> 09:15.022
(groans, laughs)

09:15.055 --> 09:17.190
Come on.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.859
You come on.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.260
My back's killing me.

09:20.293 --> 09:21.194
I'm exhausted.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.362
I'm not getting on top.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.864
Well, I'm not getting on top.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.599
Well, I'm not
getting on top.

09:25.633 --> 09:27.100
BOTH:
Jimmy!

09:27.134 --> 09:29.136
JIMMY: I can hear you
through the wall,

09:29.169 --> 09:30.638
and I'm not settling it!

09:33.774 --> 09:36.009
BOTH:
We are old.

09:41.314 --> 09:43.283
How did this happen to us?

09:43.316 --> 09:45.318
First the shrimp,
then your back.

09:45.352 --> 09:46.820
I mean, other than the seven

09:46.854 --> 09:48.388
out of the nine months
I was pregnant,

09:48.421 --> 09:50.290
we used to party every night.

09:50.323 --> 09:51.725
Getting old
isn't so bad.

09:51.759 --> 09:54.995
You can say
whatever the hell you want

09:55.028 --> 09:57.064
and nobody pays any attention.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.666
Maw Maw, stop babbling.

09:58.699 --> 09:59.667
We're trying to talk
about something here.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.101
We need to start
acting younger.

10:01.134 --> 10:04.237
I say we go get those shoes
with the wheels in them.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.173
(grunts)

10:06.206 --> 10:07.775
You're right.
If those 40-year-olds on Glee

10:07.808 --> 10:10.077
can act like teenagers,
then so can we.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.845
(both grunting)

10:15.949 --> 10:18.318
Thank you for supporting
this worthy cause.

10:18.351 --> 10:20.854
Now, for every dollar
donation to fight ABS,

10:20.888 --> 10:22.823
you get the chance
to try and catch

10:22.856 --> 10:24.357
a pitch from Natesville's
own Ricardo Montes.

10:24.391 --> 10:28.796
And if you do, you win free
groceries for an entire week.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.931
ALL:
Yeah!

10:30.964 --> 10:32.966
So good luck, everyone.

10:33.000 --> 10:33.901
Throw the heat.

10:36.203 --> 10:38.105
I only know one speed.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.973
Bullet.

10:41.074 --> 10:43.010
(grunts, crowd groaning)

10:43.043 --> 10:44.712
Toma.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.782
Psst! (hissing)

10:48.816 --> 10:50.283
Ugh. Well hello, Wyatt.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.385
What are you doing here?

10:52.419 --> 10:54.121
Just buying crappy hair products

10:54.154 --> 10:56.389
that, whoop-de-do,
didn't give a monkey cancer.

10:56.423 --> 10:57.858
Well, you know, I did tell you

10:57.891 --> 10:59.159
that can have your rain forest
hair goop back

10:59.192 --> 11:00.828
as soon
as I get my ice cream maker.

11:00.861 --> 11:01.895
That sounds like
a fair deal to me.

11:01.929 --> 11:03.030
Fair?

11:03.063 --> 11:04.131
She gave me
that ice cream maker

11:04.164 --> 11:05.298
for my birthday.

11:05.332 --> 11:06.967
Really? It was...
it was a gift?

11:07.000 --> 11:09.837
A gift that I gave to you while
we were in a relationship,

11:09.870 --> 11:12.172
which we are not anymore,
so it is no longer a gift.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.140
That is crazy.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.742
You broke up with me.

11:14.775 --> 11:15.876
Only 'cause
I was sick of your face, Wyatt.

11:15.909 --> 11:16.877
How is that my fault?

11:16.910 --> 11:17.845
Listen, just give me

11:17.878 --> 11:19.246
my ice cream maker back.

11:19.279 --> 11:20.814
You are wearing
my dead grandma's earrings.

11:20.848 --> 11:22.249
Why don't you
give those back?

11:22.282 --> 11:23.383
When your dead grandmother asks

11:23.416 --> 11:24.918
for them back,
I will give them back.

11:24.952 --> 11:27.855
I, however, am
very much alive...

11:27.888 --> 11:30.257
You guys ever hear
of a relationship rule

11:30.290 --> 11:31.925
where after you break up
with someone,

11:31.959 --> 11:34.327
you have to give them back
everything they gave you,

11:34.361 --> 11:35.863
even if it was a gift?

11:35.896 --> 11:37.330
Even if it
was a gift?
Uh-huh.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.933
No. That sounds like something
some kooky chick made up.

11:39.967 --> 11:41.401
(orange squishes,
man grunts)

11:41.434 --> 11:43.170
That's why the only
gifts I give my lovers

11:43.203 --> 11:44.504
are the things that
I do with my mouth,

11:44.537 --> 11:46.273
so if they want to
return such gifts

11:46.306 --> 11:48.275
after we break up,

11:48.308 --> 11:49.843
that's up to them.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.111
(orange smacks, man grunts)

11:51.144 --> 11:52.379
I agree.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.181
When my ex-wife and I split up,

11:54.214 --> 11:56.016
I let her keep
our vacation condo,

11:56.049 --> 11:59.219
and she let me keep the mortgage
on our vacation condo.

11:59.252 --> 12:02.055
Marriage--
really great decision.

12:02.089 --> 12:03.256
Hey, Jimmy...

12:03.290 --> 12:06.393
I'll see you tomorrow. It's on.

12:06.426 --> 12:07.861
What does he mean, "It's on"?

12:07.895 --> 12:09.229
Ugh. I was fighting
with Wyatt.

12:09.262 --> 12:10.764
Things were said,
names were called,

12:10.798 --> 12:12.365
body part sizes were mocked.

12:12.399 --> 12:15.035
Long story short,
he's racing you in the 1K,

12:15.068 --> 12:17.437
and when you win, I'm gonna get
my ice cream maker back.

12:17.470 --> 12:18.939
I have to compete in a walk-race

12:18.972 --> 12:20.307
against Wyatt just
for an ice cream maker?

12:20.340 --> 12:22.375
An ice cream maker,
my honor, your pride.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.044
Whatever you need
to motivate you

12:24.077 --> 12:25.445
to man-up and beat his ass.

12:25.478 --> 12:27.848
I love you... unless you lose.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.051
Oh, great!

12:31.084 --> 12:32.419
Now I have to compete in a race

12:32.452 --> 12:33.553
for something
I don't even believe in.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.055
RICARDO:
I am with you.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.389
This ABS thing

12:36.423 --> 12:37.958
sounds totally made up.

12:37.991 --> 12:38.959
(grunts)

12:38.992 --> 12:40.894
(smack, grunt)

12:43.831 --> 12:45.966
Oh, what's all that?

12:45.999 --> 12:48.936
Ah, your mom and I
wanted to get new outfits,

12:48.969 --> 12:51.471
so I went to the cool store
at the fancy mall.

12:51.504 --> 12:53.273
I think it's called
Apple-crappy and Felch.

12:53.306 --> 12:54.574
Ah, pretty sure it's not.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.409
Hey, can I ask you
a question?
Sure.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.311
Sabrina's been
fighting with Wyatt,

12:58.345 --> 13:00.413
but she's the one who's wrong,
so how do I...?

13:00.447 --> 13:03.416
Easy. You don't. Ever.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.285
But she's really wrong.
Listen,

13:05.318 --> 13:06.987
when your mother
and I were younger,

13:07.020 --> 13:08.455
I used to point out when
she was wrong all the time,

13:08.488 --> 13:10.257
but then we would argue,

13:10.290 --> 13:11.859
which would stress you out,
you'd poop your pants,

13:11.892 --> 13:13.894
and she'd be mad
at me for weeks.

13:13.927 --> 13:16.196
So now, as long as she's
not arguing with me,

13:16.229 --> 13:19.032
no matter how wrong she is,
I just back her up.

13:19.066 --> 13:21.601
I'm telling you,
Mel Gibson is Jewish.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.037
I saw something about it on TV.

13:24.071 --> 13:27.140
His father's either a rabbi
or a Nazi hunter, right, Burt?

13:27.174 --> 13:28.608
That's right, honey.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.610
I'm telling you, it's a giant.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.913
No! I'm telling you,

13:32.946 --> 13:35.983
the big green guy
on the can of peas is The Hulk,

13:36.016 --> 13:38.551
and he gets angry when
you don't buy his vegetables.

13:38.585 --> 13:40.020
Right, Burt?
That's right, honey.

13:40.053 --> 13:41.354
Thank you.

13:41.388 --> 13:43.223
I am telling you,

13:43.256 --> 13:46.293
that cute, little black kid
on the TV wrote a dictionary.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.395
That's why
he never acted again.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.197
He didn't have to,
right, Burt?

13:50.230 --> 13:52.065
That's right, honey.

13:52.099 --> 13:54.467
The basic fact is, you can
either be happily married,

13:54.501 --> 13:56.904
or you can be right,
but you can't be both.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.872
Dit-dit-dit!

13:58.906 --> 14:02.142
Hey, you bought us
clothes, too?

14:02.175 --> 14:05.245
So did I. I went to that
Suburban Outfitters place.

14:05.278 --> 14:09.149
The gal told me these were
totes cool, and I totes agreed.

14:09.182 --> 14:12.519
So you and I are totes gonna
wear 'em out to a club tonight

14:12.552 --> 14:14.587
and totes have
a totes unreal time.

14:14.621 --> 14:17.024
How random is that?

14:17.057 --> 14:18.892
You sound young as hell.
Thanks, brah.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.171
Burt, everybody's looking
at their phones.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.240
We should look
at our phones, too.

14:37.077 --> 14:39.012
RICARDO:
Hey!

14:39.046 --> 14:42.682
Burt, Virginia,
look at you out past 9:00.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.017
Good for you, staying active.

14:44.051 --> 14:48.255
No, we're not staying active.
We ar active.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.423
Why are you carrying that flat
version of yourself around?

14:50.457 --> 14:52.459
Oh, Barney lets me borrow him
at night.

14:52.492 --> 14:55.062
Uh, you see, I'm-I'm in
a committed relationship,

14:55.095 --> 14:58.365
but, uh, he... he can get all
the tail he wants.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.699
So, later in the night,

14:59.732 --> 15:04.071
if there is a mix-up,
no one is the wiser.

15:04.104 --> 15:07.107
Hey, flat guy and his
wingman, come on in.

15:07.140 --> 15:09.676
Come with me.
You can be our entourage.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.417
I'm going to need
to see some I.D.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.286
What? Really?

15:19.319 --> 15:20.387
I mean,

15:20.420 --> 15:21.554
of course.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.090
He wants to see some I.D.

15:24.157 --> 15:25.993
Here you go.

15:26.026 --> 15:30.130
Okay. Sorry, you just look a lot
younger than you actually are.

15:30.163 --> 15:31.498
Thank you.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.333
And you are very good
at your job.

15:33.366 --> 15:35.135
I'm sure it's a lot harder

15:35.168 --> 15:37.570
than it looks, standing in front
of a door, holding a clipboard.

15:37.604 --> 15:40.073
Probably need to see
my I.D., too.

15:40.107 --> 15:42.509
Uh, not with that much ear hair.

15:43.710 --> 15:46.313
Look on the bright side, baby.

15:46.346 --> 15:49.182
You got yourself a trophy wife.

15:51.618 --> 15:54.287
(club music blaring)

15:54.321 --> 15:56.256
Aah! Oh, man!

15:56.289 --> 15:59.359
(shouting):
Is it gonna be this loud
the whole time?

16:07.100 --> 16:08.501
And though
that date was going well,

16:08.535 --> 16:10.603
and I thought
it would lead to another, and

16:10.637 --> 16:13.173
maybe finally finding
the love of my life,

16:13.206 --> 16:15.675
unfortunately, somebody
else was on that date.

16:15.708 --> 16:18.645
And his initials were "ABS."

16:18.678 --> 16:20.780
All right, Jimmy,
all you got to do is

16:20.813 --> 16:22.382
just go out there
and just win back

16:22.415 --> 16:23.616
what's rightfully mine.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.385
Okay, I'll do my best

16:25.418 --> 16:27.187
to win back
the ice cream maker

16:27.220 --> 16:29.356
that, though you gave it
to Wyatt as a gift,

16:29.389 --> 16:30.557
is still rightfully yours.

16:30.590 --> 16:32.292
That's all I ask for.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.993
(indistinct chatter)

16:35.095 --> 16:36.196
Yo! Yo!

16:36.229 --> 16:37.464
Yo! Yo!

16:37.497 --> 16:40.467
What the hell is up
with your hair?
Nothing.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.802
Just decided to touch it
up a little, that's all.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.038
Well, you look like
one of those birds

16:45.072 --> 16:46.473
from that Juan Valdez oil spill.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.808
Oh, please. It's such
a double-standard.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.543
How come you get to
cheat to look younger?

16:50.577 --> 16:52.212
(scoffing)

16:52.245 --> 16:54.114
I've seen your drawer
in the bathroom.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.748
It's one set of
vampire fangs away

16:55.782 --> 16:58.651
from being a special
effects studio.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.553
(exhaling, inhaling)

17:00.587 --> 17:02.422
And once I'd cleaned
her tile floor,

17:02.455 --> 17:05.692
and she loaned me a robe,
I thought we had really bonded,

17:05.725 --> 17:08.661
but she never returned my calls.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.563
(voice breaking):
They never do.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.832
(sniffling)

17:12.865 --> 17:15.535
And now, here to start our race,

17:15.568 --> 17:18.138
our ABS spokesman,
Ricardo Montes.

17:18.171 --> 17:20.073
(applause)

17:22.609 --> 17:24.744
I will be honest,

17:24.777 --> 17:26.746
I did not know what ABS was,

17:26.779 --> 17:30.750
and I have now realized
that it is the poopy disease,

17:30.783 --> 17:33.220
uh, so I will not

17:33.253 --> 17:35.755
risk startling you
by firing the gun to start.

17:35.788 --> 17:37.557
I'll just yell, "Go!"

17:37.590 --> 17:39.126
(laughs)

17:39.159 --> 17:41.861
Uh, but understand
that when I say "go,"

17:41.894 --> 17:45.265
I, um... I don't mean...

17:45.298 --> 17:47.767
go, right?

17:47.800 --> 17:50.437
You know, I'll just quietly

17:50.470 --> 17:53.440
say, "walk."

17:53.473 --> 17:55.542
Walk.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.510
(applause)

18:02.482 --> 18:04.584
Why are you walking
so fast?

18:04.617 --> 18:06.253
I'm not walking that fast.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.888
I'm just walking at the
speed a young man walks at.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.290
What up with that, yo?

18:10.323 --> 18:12.725
(sighs)
This is not a competition.

18:12.759 --> 18:15.262
Says the old woman
who's losing.

18:15.295 --> 18:17.297
I've been really nice
up to now, Burt,

18:17.330 --> 18:18.765
but you're being
ridiculous.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.733
I'm a year and eight months
younger than you.

18:20.767 --> 18:21.668
LOL.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.403
Hashtag...

18:23.436 --> 18:25.138
you couldn't keep up
with me if you wanted to.

18:25.172 --> 18:27.174
Hashtag, Virginia is awesome.

18:27.207 --> 18:29.909
Reply all.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.312
Why do you even
care about this?

18:32.345 --> 18:33.646
You know she's wrong.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.748
I don't necessarily
know that.
You know it.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.450
And you're still
trying to beat me

18:37.484 --> 18:39.286
so you can take
my ice cream maker

18:39.319 --> 18:40.587
when you already
have everything.

18:40.620 --> 18:41.921
Everything? Everything
I have is secondhand.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.256
I mean, do you know
what it's like

18:43.290 --> 18:44.457
to have another
man's name sewn

18:44.491 --> 18:46.159
into the waistband
of your underpants?

18:46.193 --> 18:47.460
It doesn't matter.
That's nothing.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.862
Sabrina was all I had,
and you took her from me.

18:49.896 --> 18:51.464
I'm never going to get married

18:51.498 --> 18:53.600
'cause I lost the love
of my life to you.

18:53.633 --> 18:54.867
(sighs)

18:54.901 --> 18:56.603
Congratulations
on having it all.

18:56.636 --> 18:57.437
Are you crying?

18:57.470 --> 18:58.838
No!

18:58.871 --> 19:00.473
JIMMY:
I kind of felt sorry for Wyatt.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.309
It seemed like
he really needed a win.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.777
But still, I didn't want
to disappoint Sabrina.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.879
Faster! He's pulling ahead!

19:06.913 --> 19:09.616
I mean, uh, Hope, winning
and losing doesn't matter.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.384
It's trying that counts.

19:11.418 --> 19:12.485
Pick up the pace, Sally!

19:14.754 --> 19:16.823
Walk, Wyatt! Walk!

19:16.856 --> 19:20.460
Walk! Walk like the love
of your parents depends on it!

19:20.493 --> 19:21.861
Give it up, Virginia.

19:21.894 --> 19:24.197
You look like you're
chasing after a school bus

19:24.231 --> 19:25.665
you overslept
by 20 years.
Oh, yeah?

19:25.698 --> 19:27.467
Well, the way
your hair dye is running down

19:27.500 --> 19:30.237
the side of your head,
you look like a old man candle.

19:30.270 --> 19:31.671
JIMMY: And then,
with my parents arguing,

19:31.704 --> 19:33.340
I couldn't even concentrate.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.975
Fine, but at least I look
totes younger than you.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.344
Would you stop saying
totes, Burt?

19:37.377 --> 19:38.845
You're not even
saying it right.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.813
I totally totes am.
What do you think, Jimmy?

19:40.847 --> 19:42.849
Who looks younger--
your mother, or me?

19:42.882 --> 19:43.883
Yeah, Jimmy,
who's younger?

19:43.916 --> 19:46.519
Jimmy, catch up to him!

19:46.553 --> 19:47.754
Well, who's younger?

19:47.787 --> 19:49.289
Yeah, who's younger?

19:49.322 --> 19:50.490
JIMMY:
I didn't know what to do.

19:50.523 --> 19:51.824
Choose my mother or my father?

19:51.858 --> 19:54.494
Let Wyatt win?
Make Sabrina happy?

19:54.527 --> 19:57.730
In the end, I decided
to go with my gut.

20:01.734 --> 20:04.537
And at that moment,
my gut decided it had to go.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.378
(cheering)
No! No!

20:11.411 --> 20:13.380
SABRINA:
No! No!

20:13.413 --> 20:14.847
(sing-songy):
Who wants homemade ice cream?

20:14.881 --> 20:16.015
I do!

20:16.048 --> 20:17.517
(laughter)

20:17.550 --> 20:18.585
Ooh!

20:18.618 --> 20:20.620
Aah! Aah.

20:20.653 --> 20:21.788
You okay?

20:21.821 --> 20:24.691
Uh, I think I pulled something.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.293
(laughing)

20:26.326 --> 20:28.227
(sighs)

20:29.896 --> 20:31.898
Here... let me help you.

20:31.931 --> 20:33.400
No, you finish.
You were right.

20:33.433 --> 20:35.034
Maybe it's time
for me to admit

20:35.067 --> 20:36.536
that I'm not
young anymore.

20:36.569 --> 20:37.770
So?

20:37.804 --> 20:39.038
(both groan)

20:39.071 --> 20:40.373
Maybe we're both
getting old.

20:40.407 --> 20:42.442
At least we'll
grow old together.

20:42.475 --> 20:44.911
Oh, that's sweet, baby.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.613
Aah! Hair dye in my eyes!

20:46.646 --> 20:47.980
Hair dye in my eyes!

20:48.014 --> 20:50.049
I'll be your eyes, baby.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.051
Bear left, bear left.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.886
JIMMY: That's when Mom
and Dad realized

20:53.920 --> 20:56.423
you couldn't avoid growing old,
but it was all right,

20:56.456 --> 20:58.591
as long as they were going
to do it together

20:58.625 --> 21:00.493
and help each other
over the finish line.

21:00.527 --> 21:01.628
Turn around, Burt!

21:01.661 --> 21:03.296
When you're in a relationship,

21:03.330 --> 21:05.765
you have to find ways
to support each other.

21:08.601 --> 21:11.704
Even if it's in a way
your partner might not expect.

21:14.974 --> 21:17.043
(sighs)

21:19.546 --> 21:21.748
Mom also learned that
no matter how young you are,

21:21.781 --> 21:24.016
there is always
somebody younger.

21:24.050 --> 21:25.718
Shrimp for the pretty lady?
