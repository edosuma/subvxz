00:14.218 --> 00:14.931
What?

00:15.088 --> 00:15.857
"What"?

00:15.899 --> 00:17.632
- You're eating fruit.
- No.

00:18.103 --> 00:19.894
I'm trying to cut back on fatty foods.

00:20.498 --> 00:22.897
Lauren says my diet...

00:22.981 --> 00:24.107
makes me feel older.

00:24.347 --> 00:26.344
You know what's making you feel older?

00:26.902 --> 00:27.759
Your age.

00:29.186 --> 00:31.864
Flynn, this woman has transformed me.

00:32.686 --> 00:34.370
I met her nine weeks ago,

00:34.412 --> 00:36.744
and I'm almost off of my
blood-pressure medication.

00:37.651 --> 00:39.914
- You know why?
- No, I'm pretty sure I don't want to.

00:40.684 --> 00:42.166
Every night by 9:30,

00:48.507 --> 00:49.424
Unbelievable.

00:57.985 --> 01:00.268
That's all followed by
30 minutes of aerobics

01:00.864 --> 01:02.270
and 2 fish-oil capsules.

01:08.414 --> 01:09.610
Morning, gentlemen.

01:10.029 --> 01:12.249
- Morning, Chief.
- No "Chief" today.

01:12.291 --> 01:13.781
I'm just one of the guys.

01:15.364 --> 01:19.321
So, that we can get a better handle
on why you're doing these ride-alongs,

01:19.580 --> 01:21.247
what's it you're looking to experience?

01:21.332 --> 01:23.833
Just, you know, what you
guys do on a daily basis,

01:23.917 --> 01:27.708
which, hopefully, will help
me break down some of the walls

01:27.750 --> 01:31.174
within the department, you know? We need
to stop being... such isolated experts.

01:31.258 --> 01:34.719
I want to get back to our one
specialization, which is...

01:35.111 --> 01:35.845
justice.

01:36.402 --> 01:38.514
We need to be able to act like one...

01:38.873 --> 01:40.151
Department, one...

01:42.286 --> 01:44.023
Is that bothering you, Chief?

01:44.284 --> 01:46.189
Yeah, Lieutenant, as a
matter of fact, it is.

01:52.079 --> 01:52.982
Really?

01:53.766 --> 01:56.574
Yellow tape goes up in your
vicinity, and that's your reaction?

01:56.769 --> 01:58.701
Chief, this is central territory.

01:59.247 --> 02:00.870
They need us, we have our ringers on.

02:02.995 --> 02:04.582
Excuse me, gentlemen. I'm gonna...

02:05.117 --> 02:08.330
go across the street to the crime
scene if, for no other reason, than...

02:08.372 --> 02:11.380
- I'm a police officer.
- What happened to your one of the guys?

02:11.464 --> 02:12.799
I am one of the guys.

02:12.883 --> 02:15.880
One of the guys who gets his
responsibility to protect.

02:16.315 --> 02:19.442
One of the guys who understands
the concept "to serve. "

02:23.515 --> 02:25.394
- One of those guys.
- Oh, God.

02:26.532 --> 02:28.064
I hate those guys.

02:38.505 --> 02:40.284
Chief Pope. Sir.

02:40.777 --> 02:42.079
What brings you here?

02:42.391 --> 02:43.830
Just doing my job, Detective...

02:44.364 --> 02:46.492
- Have we met?
- No, never had the honor, sir.

02:46.534 --> 02:49.941
I'm, Detective Richard Tracy.
I just transferred to central.

02:50.219 --> 02:52.588
- It's great to meet you, Chief.
- You, too, Detective.

02:52.672 --> 02:53.988
Officer Sullivan.

02:54.534 --> 02:57.426
And, that's Lieutenants Flynn
and Provenza from Major Crimes.

02:57.631 --> 02:58.678
Major Crimes.

02:59.231 --> 03:02.051
I just called your office three
minutes ago. You guys move fast.

03:02.093 --> 03:04.185
Yeah. First time anyone's
accused them of that.

03:04.227 --> 03:05.935
You want to bring us up to speed?

03:06.272 --> 03:07.270
Okay. Well,

03:07.354 --> 03:10.815
our victim was shot
approximately 7:30 this A.M.,

03:10.857 --> 03:13.556
apparently, while returning to his car.

03:13.705 --> 03:15.735
His keys were in his right hand.

03:15.820 --> 03:18.117
The vehicle's in that
guest spot right there,

03:18.159 --> 03:19.854
alarm disabled.

03:20.897 --> 03:24.359
The wallet was still in his pants, so,

03:24.401 --> 03:26.923
you know, robbery doesn't
really appear to be a motive.

03:27.208 --> 03:29.647
But a close-range shot to the face...

03:29.751 --> 03:31.544
That suggests a personal attack, right?

03:32.473 --> 03:33.590
Any witnesses?

03:33.922 --> 03:37.592
Yes. Building resident in the
stairwell heard two gunshots and then,

03:37.676 --> 03:39.907
about 10 seconds later,
saw a woman run past her.

03:39.949 --> 03:41.635
Got a real good look at her face, too.

03:41.677 --> 03:45.320
Second witness saw a black BMW
stopped behind the building.

03:45.411 --> 03:47.549
Something dropped out of
the driver's-side window,

03:47.591 --> 03:50.438
and a patrolman recovered... this gun.

03:51.781 --> 03:54.578
Now, initially, you know, I thought
that this shooting might be related

03:54.620 --> 03:57.569
to that unsolved one we had
last tuesday at ninth and grand,

03:57.611 --> 03:58.988
but the calibers don't match.

03:59.603 --> 04:02.283
I marked the casings where they landed,

04:02.367 --> 04:04.033
and this is the victim's cellphone.

04:06.031 --> 04:06.813
Sorry.

04:08.055 --> 04:10.946
I was just driving home from
an all-nighter, you know,

04:10.988 --> 04:12.582
and I heard the sirens, and I figured

04:12.624 --> 04:14.749
I'd probably be the first
Detective on the scene, so...

04:14.791 --> 04:16.672
No apology necessary, Detective.

04:17.641 --> 04:18.827
You know, if you want,

04:18.869 --> 04:21.144
I'd be happy to log all
that stuff in for you.

04:22.794 --> 04:23.663
Okay.

04:24.023 --> 04:24.866
Thanks.

04:25.313 --> 04:26.455
My pleasure.

04:26.497 --> 04:28.654
We all work for the same
woman, after all, don't we?

04:29.448 --> 04:30.423
Chief Johnson?

04:30.863 --> 04:32.355
No, no, no, no. I mean, you know,

04:32.869 --> 04:36.067
The lady with the blindfold
and the scales in her hands,

04:36.151 --> 04:38.840
you know what I mean. 'cause we
all have one specialization, right?

04:38.882 --> 04:39.801
Justice.

04:40.254 --> 04:42.025
"Divisions won't divide us. "

04:42.067 --> 04:44.053
That's our new mission
statement, isn't it, Chief?

04:44.301 --> 04:46.433
That's it exactly,
Detective. That's right.

04:46.475 --> 04:48.321
Hey, you know what?
In case I get held up,

04:48.363 --> 04:50.208
- you mind if I grab your cards?
- Sure.

04:56.017 --> 04:56.805
Thanks.

05:05.179 --> 05:07.143
- Kiss-ass. -
Yeah. Big-time.

05:08.347 --> 05:10.889
Now, that guy is an example
of the kind of police force

05:10.931 --> 05:12.440
I'm trying to build here, you know?

05:12.482 --> 05:15.186
He didn't drive by the crime
scene and say, "it's not my job. "

05:15.228 --> 05:16.868
He was proactive.

05:20.030 --> 05:22.196
For a second, I thought
that was coming from me.

05:22.983 --> 05:24.906
Yes, yes, he's dead!

05:28.933 --> 05:30.663
Was he a friend of yours?

05:40.452 --> 05:42.049
All right. Let's try this again.

05:42.563 --> 05:44.218
When you last saw the victim...

05:48.242 --> 05:49.049
Buzz.

05:49.682 --> 05:51.892
Spent an hour in the parking
garage with this woman today.

05:51.977 --> 05:53.561
I cannot take any more of this.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.439
Why didn't your squad ever show up?

05:56.629 --> 05:58.941
Sorry, Chief. No one
from roll-out let us know.

05:59.496 --> 06:00.671
It was phoned in.

06:01.234 --> 06:03.815
And, you don't have to
call me "Chief" today.

06:03.989 --> 06:05.576
I'm just one of the guys.

06:07.116 --> 06:09.235
I think she started making words.

06:09.747 --> 06:10.785
Oh, my God.

06:10.827 --> 06:12.887
I just realized I
never had sex with a...

06:13.222 --> 06:15.124
dead person before.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.774
Well, presumably, he wasn't
dead when you had sex with him.

06:18.531 --> 06:19.253
Was he?

06:21.673 --> 06:23.720
What was the name of the vic...

06:23.919 --> 06:25.384
The man that you slept with?

06:26.016 --> 06:27.178
Intrigue.

06:28.450 --> 06:31.640
Wait... Did you say
his name was "Intrigue"?

06:31.920 --> 06:34.916
His real name was Mark Bernstein.

06:35.677 --> 06:36.557
Oh, my God.

06:36.980 --> 06:40.741
If my boss finds out that
he died in my parking garage,

06:40.783 --> 06:43.459
I'm gonna be in so much trouble!

06:43.501 --> 06:45.619
Who else knew that Intrigue...

06:45.806 --> 06:47.656
Mr. Bernstein... Spent
the night with you?

06:48.015 --> 06:50.201
Nobody. I didn't tell anyone. Why?

06:50.285 --> 06:53.249
Because if Mark Bernstein
doesn't live in your building

06:53.291 --> 06:55.247
and you were the only
one who knew where he was,

06:55.626 --> 06:58.196
I have to wonder if you
followed him downstairs

06:58.238 --> 07:00.211
to the parking garage
and shot him yourself...

07:00.951 --> 07:02.880
Or called someone to kill him for you.

07:03.433 --> 07:04.373
Oh, my God.

07:05.195 --> 07:07.879
You're accusing me of murder?

07:14.996 --> 07:15.872
Sergeant.

07:18.047 --> 07:21.002
Do you have the witness statements
yet or the victim's cellphone?

07:21.399 --> 07:24.706
Or the Detectives' notes or anything
that actually might lead us somewhere?

07:24.748 --> 07:26.487
Nothing's been logged in evidence yet.

07:26.571 --> 07:28.809
I'll get on the line to central
and see what the holdup is.

07:28.851 --> 07:30.908
Someone needs to stay
here with our witness.

07:35.524 --> 07:36.626
Dear God.

07:39.470 --> 07:42.695
So, why is this even a major crime?
The only thing we know about this guy

07:42.737 --> 07:46.052
is that his name was Mark Bernstein
and he called himself "Intrigue. "

07:46.635 --> 07:48.801
Someone killed Intrigue?

07:49.987 --> 07:51.971
You know who this man was, Detective?

07:52.114 --> 07:54.390
- I mean, he's kind of famous, Chief.
- For what?

07:54.474 --> 07:55.724
The Intrigue technique.

07:56.358 --> 07:57.778
It's a system for...

07:58.774 --> 07:59.978
picking up women.

08:00.063 --> 08:01.730
What do you mean there's no Detective

08:01.772 --> 08:03.962
by that name working at central?

08:05.078 --> 08:07.163
Well, that's a mistake, because...

08:07.654 --> 08:08.987
we all just met him.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.240
Check again.

08:12.606 --> 08:15.369
Yes, I'll tell you who's asking...
Assistant Chief William Pope.

08:15.453 --> 08:18.914
Let the record show that he was one
of the guys for less than two hours.

08:19.398 --> 08:21.973
Look, I spoke with him this morning.

08:22.931 --> 08:26.442
Yes, Detective Richard Tracy, yes.

08:27.646 --> 08:29.675
Okay, let me speak with
your immediate supervisor.

08:30.203 --> 08:31.001
Now.

08:34.777 --> 08:36.821
Excuse me. Chief...

08:37.365 --> 08:39.482
Am I to understand that you and,

08:39.524 --> 08:41.729
Lieutenant Flynn and Lieutenant Provenza

08:42.008 --> 08:43.657
handed overall...

08:43.698 --> 08:47.505
the evidence from the crime scene,
including the gun, to a Detective...

08:48.064 --> 08:49.987
Dick Tracy?

09:00.334 --> 09:01.553
Yes, Cindy...

09:03.128 --> 09:03.959
Never mind.

09:10.228 --> 09:11.006
Now...

09:12.490 --> 09:14.426
This... is...

09:15.232 --> 09:16.133
definitely...

09:16.751 --> 09:17.752
a major crime.

09:19.017 --> 09:22.144
- Did you even ask to see his badge?
- No, I didn't.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.956
Then how could you have been so certain

09:23.998 --> 09:25.856
that he was an actual LAPD Detective?

09:26.157 --> 09:27.691
He knew my mission statement.

09:27.775 --> 09:29.902
That should have been proof
that he didn't work here.

09:29.986 --> 09:33.509
- How did we miss that?
- Chief, this... this Tracy guy...

09:33.551 --> 09:37.034
I mean, he seemed authentic. I
mean, he had an LAPD Notebook,

09:37.120 --> 09:40.121
he had the forms, he
knew things, like...

09:40.163 --> 09:43.077
Right, like the caliber of
the bullets used in that...

09:43.167 --> 09:46.015
in that shooting at ninth
and grand on tuesday, right?

09:46.057 --> 09:47.057
Yeah, yeah, that.

09:48.650 --> 09:50.987
So... We have a tainted crime scene,

09:51.243 --> 09:53.418
a murder weapon and casings
out of the chain of custody.

09:53.460 --> 09:56.553
We heard that there were
witnesses from someone

09:56.637 --> 10:00.474
who could quite possibly be the killer
and, if not, a pathological liar.

10:01.559 --> 10:03.766
I say we just check
with robbery homicide

10:03.808 --> 10:05.898
and see if they're tracking
any police impersonators.

10:05.940 --> 10:08.816
It'll take two seconds.
No, that's a bad idea.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.035
Bad idea.

10:12.309 --> 10:16.302
Chief, I found Mark Bernstein's, a.
K. a. Intrigue's, bio on Wikipedia.

10:16.939 --> 10:19.310
I'm printing it out now,
along with his DMV info.

10:21.394 --> 10:24.394
This... This is the hookup king?

10:24.500 --> 10:26.792
- His method mustreally work.
- It does.

10:32.006 --> 10:33.590
Is that our victim, Lieutenant?

10:40.556 --> 10:41.724
Yeah. That's him.

10:43.046 --> 10:44.768
Okay, Lieutenant Provenza,

10:44.994 --> 10:47.332
a search warrant for
Intrigue's residence

10:47.374 --> 10:50.660
and the apartment of our lady of
the screams, Marie Morgan's, as well.

10:50.702 --> 10:51.650
Thank you.

10:54.408 --> 10:57.406
Good morning. I'm deputy Chief
Brenda Leigh Johnson of the LAPD,

10:58.009 --> 11:00.832
and I have a warrant to search
the residence of Mark Bernstein,

11:00.874 --> 11:03.287
- A.K.A. Intrigue.
- Again?

11:04.750 --> 11:05.544
Excuse me?

11:05.586 --> 11:07.902
The LAPD was here an hour
ago and cleared his place out.

11:07.944 --> 11:09.626
Who was here, exactly?

11:10.260 --> 11:11.324
Let's see.

11:11.688 --> 11:13.139
His name was...

11:13.548 --> 11:15.924
Lieutenant Provenza of
the Major Crimes Unit.

11:22.047 --> 11:25.722
Besides the laptop computer,
did you see what else he took?

11:26.108 --> 11:28.280
Dvds, books, bills.

11:28.590 --> 11:30.576
I helped him carry out
three boxes of stuff.

11:30.886 --> 11:32.316
You did? What a gentleman.

11:32.812 --> 11:35.445
Well, Lieutenant Provenza
was a very pleasant guy.

11:36.438 --> 11:39.795
Can you tell me about any
women coming or going recently?

11:40.069 --> 11:42.242
From here? None. Ever.

11:42.824 --> 11:45.376
That was one of Intrigue's
rules. Your home,

11:45.624 --> 11:47.163
- your sanctuary.
- Your sanctuary.

11:49.252 --> 11:51.668
Did Intrigue mention if
anyone had threatened him?

11:51.752 --> 11:54.932
These questions are almost word-for-word
what Lieutenant Provenza asked.

11:54.974 --> 11:56.376
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:56.418 --> 11:59.593
Everybody loved Intrigue. You may
find this hard to believe, but...

11:59.877 --> 12:01.845
I'm not naturally so
lucky with the lady folk.

12:02.440 --> 12:04.969
But after his web
course, that all changed.

12:05.151 --> 12:06.336
And not just once...

12:06.690 --> 12:07.620
Twice.

12:08.442 --> 12:11.730
Well, thank you, Mr. O'keefe.
Could you just give us one second?

12:12.587 --> 12:13.857
Thank you.

12:14.424 --> 12:15.627
Hey, Chief. Chief.

12:15.838 --> 12:18.862
I don't know if this is anything, but
it's marked "'tapped'pilot rough cut,"

12:19.218 --> 12:20.906
but the... dvd is gone.

12:21.197 --> 12:22.949
Wonderful... We have no witnesses,

12:23.035 --> 12:26.273
and whatever evidence this guy's
got is gonna be inadmissible in court

12:26.315 --> 12:29.024
- because it was wrongfully obtained.
- No, it's only wrongfully obtained

12:29.066 --> 12:31.708
if it was collected by a police
officer, which it was not.

12:33.006 --> 12:35.546
As soon as we locate this
so-called Detective Tracy,

12:35.630 --> 12:37.256
we can use whatever he's collected,

12:37.341 --> 12:41.222
and go to jail for burglary, obstruction
of justice, and possibly murder.

12:41.264 --> 12:42.810
Murder? Really?

12:42.852 --> 12:44.158
If Tracy killed this guy,

12:44.200 --> 12:46.557
why would he come here
andbring a warrant?

12:46.641 --> 12:47.641
Yeah, easy.

12:47.865 --> 12:49.536
He murders Intrigue to get his keys,

12:49.578 --> 12:51.352
the warrant gets him
in without suspicion,

12:51.437 --> 12:53.689
and takes away everything that
connects him to the victim.

12:55.318 --> 12:57.152
Detective Sanchez, Sergeant Gabriel,

12:57.194 --> 13:00.009
would you please go back to the
crime scene and canvass the neighbors?

13:00.051 --> 13:02.360
See if you can locate
our original witnesses.

13:03.261 --> 13:04.117
Thank you.

13:05.311 --> 13:07.380
I don't know... The guy may be a killer,

13:07.422 --> 13:09.649
but he's acting more
like a wannabe Detective.

13:09.691 --> 13:11.415
Makes me wonder where he might go next.

13:12.577 --> 13:13.456
Oh, no.

13:15.543 --> 13:16.253
Oh, no.

13:16.727 --> 13:17.518
What?

13:17.560 --> 13:18.758
The notification.

13:22.556 --> 13:25.095
Mr. Bernstein? I'm Brenda
Leigh Johnson from...

13:25.179 --> 13:27.248
LAPD, Cris response team.

13:27.515 --> 13:29.247
Chief Pope told us to expect you.

13:29.818 --> 13:31.435
Who told you... what?

13:31.520 --> 13:35.116
LAPD, Assistant Chief William Pope.

13:35.982 --> 13:38.984
He gave us the news about my
brother's murder an hour ago,

13:39.068 --> 13:41.904
and he said you people from Crisis
Response would be here to help us.

13:41.988 --> 13:44.270
- Come on in.
- Yes, wonderful. Thank you.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.742
Well, you served the warrant,
Pope did the notification.

13:46.827 --> 13:48.968
I wonder what the hell
I'm doing right now.

13:51.363 --> 13:54.291
This is jill pappas, the
network executive who decided

13:54.376 --> 13:56.223
to put mine and my
brother's show on the air.

13:56.265 --> 13:59.588
Ms. Pappas, I'm Brenda
Leigh Johnson, and this is...

14:02.509 --> 14:03.774
Detective Pfifu.

14:04.630 --> 14:06.386
I'm so sorry about your loss.

14:07.075 --> 14:08.847
So, you and your brother had a show?

14:09.122 --> 14:11.391
It was supposed to premiere
on Slag TV next week.

14:11.591 --> 14:13.477
- Slag TV?
- It's a cable channel.

14:14.380 --> 14:16.311
- Please have a seat.
- Thank you so much.

14:16.353 --> 14:18.408
Ken and I were just
sitting down to discuss

14:18.450 --> 14:21.038
all the upcoming episodes
when Chief Pope...

14:22.134 --> 14:23.024
stopped by.

14:24.163 --> 14:26.658
One of the first things
we like to do in...

14:26.700 --> 14:28.605
cris response is make certain

14:28.647 --> 14:31.328
that the family notification
was done properly,

14:31.412 --> 14:35.146
so perhaps you can tell us what
Chief Pope discussed with you.

14:35.941 --> 14:36.896
He seemed...

14:37.324 --> 14:40.504
really focused on knowing who
mark went home with last night.

14:40.727 --> 14:42.839
- What did you tell him?
- We had no idea.

14:43.300 --> 14:45.842
Knowing my brother, it was
probably a girl he'd just met.

14:47.136 --> 14:50.097
Chief Pope asked about the women
who've appeared on our show, as well.

14:50.181 --> 14:51.855
Did you provide him with names?

14:51.897 --> 14:54.315
I told him that he could get
them from Jill's assistant.

14:54.357 --> 14:57.409
Unfortunately, Marie is not
responding to our messages.

14:57.451 --> 14:58.993
Has she texted you yet?

15:00.985 --> 15:03.926
I just can't wrap my head
around the idea that mark is...

15:04.570 --> 15:05.404
gone.

15:06.076 --> 15:08.024
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Yes.

15:09.260 --> 15:10.444
Ms. Pappas...

15:11.575 --> 15:15.337
the brothers, Ken and...
and Mark, did they get along?

15:16.702 --> 15:18.458
- Do you have brothers?
- Three.

15:18.953 --> 15:20.460
Well, then you know how it is.

15:21.336 --> 15:25.129
I think Ken had a little crush on
my assistant, but she liked Intrigue.

15:25.520 --> 15:26.758
Was Ken aware of this?

15:26.889 --> 15:29.768
I think so, but I would never have
brought it up, because, well...

15:30.471 --> 15:32.574
the brothers did so much
better when they got along.

15:32.616 --> 15:33.515
Of course.

15:33.804 --> 15:35.891
I found Intrigue, I developed the show,

15:35.976 --> 15:38.114
and the pilot was
testing off the charts.

15:38.493 --> 15:40.522
It's just such a huge
loss on so many levels.

15:42.989 --> 15:45.276
- Would you excuse me?
- Absolutely.

15:47.330 --> 15:49.281
We find this Tracy
guy, I'm gonna kill him.

15:49.365 --> 15:50.817
- Get in line.
- Get in line.

15:50.859 --> 15:54.042
Here's what I don't get. I haven't
made any kind of public statement yet,

15:54.084 --> 15:56.573
so who gave him all this
"no divisions" stuff?

15:56.615 --> 15:57.413
You did.

15:57.509 --> 15:59.095
Our public transparency project

15:59.137 --> 16:01.986
with the new LAPD website
went online last month.

16:07.341 --> 16:09.935
Okay, I had nothing to do with... this.

16:09.977 --> 16:13.013
They asked me for a few photos
and a couple of old speeches.

16:13.915 --> 16:16.016
Oh, my God. What else is on there?

16:16.100 --> 16:18.745
Case details updated hourly,
crime stats by the neighborhood...

16:18.787 --> 16:21.077
That's probably how he found
out about the other shooting.

16:21.119 --> 16:23.148
Tracy is monitoring the website,

16:23.627 --> 16:25.104
quite possibly as we speak.

16:25.303 --> 16:28.612
Okay, what else have you found
out about our victim, Lieutenant?

16:28.696 --> 16:30.125
Intriguing endeavors,

16:30.206 --> 16:33.450
the company formed by ken and
Mark Bernstein, was a cash cow.

16:34.141 --> 16:36.433
Pulled in over $12
million last year alone.

16:36.475 --> 16:38.486
There were some questions
about some unpaid taxes

16:38.528 --> 16:40.521
and an offshore company
pulling in proceeds,

16:40.563 --> 16:42.626
but the FBI's investigating that.

16:43.884 --> 16:46.726
No, no. Fritz and I have
discussed this, and we have a deal.

16:46.768 --> 16:48.674
We no longer share
information with each other.

16:48.972 --> 16:51.150
Yeah, well, I don't
have that deal, and...

16:51.192 --> 16:53.884
if there's one time that "no
divisions" should mean something,

16:53.926 --> 16:57.307
it's when FBI and local law enforcement
can work together to solve a murder.

16:57.644 --> 17:00.287
Chief, either Tracy is the murder

17:00.329 --> 17:02.613
and he's running around
collecting all the evidence

17:02.655 --> 17:04.848
and he's contaminating
every single witness...

17:04.890 --> 17:08.054
Or he's not the killer, and we have
to stop him before he makes an arrest.

17:09.071 --> 17:11.169
Until now, he's been
one step ahead of us.

17:11.318 --> 17:13.476
But we know something that he doesn't...

17:13.518 --> 17:16.284
Where the victim spent the night
and with whom. Lieutenant Tao.

17:16.511 --> 17:19.829
I'm updating the online
case file as we speak, Chief.

17:37.256 --> 17:38.408
Who is it?

17:38.644 --> 17:41.411
LAPD, Ms. Morgan. I'm
sorry to bother you.

17:44.393 --> 17:45.564
Who did you say it was?

17:45.820 --> 17:48.016
Lieutenant Andrew Flynn of Major Crimes.

17:48.058 --> 17:49.803
I just want to ask you a few questions.

17:50.611 --> 17:51.565
Just a second.

17:57.326 --> 17:58.606
What are you doing?!

17:58.648 --> 18:00.954
Lieutenant Flynn, I believe
you've met Lieutenant Flynn.

18:01.038 --> 18:02.372
Who the hell are you, huh?!

18:02.456 --> 18:05.998
I'm a serious homicide Detective
doing serious investigative work!

18:06.040 --> 18:08.128
You are also seriously
under arrest, you freak!

18:08.212 --> 18:10.045
I'm not under arrest.
You're under arrest.

18:10.087 --> 18:13.045
- Put your hands up against the wall!
- I'm arresting you and you!

18:13.087 --> 18:16.344
You're all under arrest for assault
and battery of a police officer!

18:16.428 --> 18:17.846
<i>Help! Police!</i>

18:18.046 --> 18:20.606
- I am the police.
- You have the right to remain silent.

18:20.648 --> 18:23.559
- Do not read me my rights.
- Don't you tell me what to do.

18:29.837 --> 18:32.569
Okay. Okay. Look, I'll
show you one more time.

18:33.295 --> 18:36.239
You click here, and you're
displaying the interview-room cameras.

18:36.646 --> 18:38.421
But I still can't ear anything!

18:38.463 --> 18:41.283
Because you have to
clickthis to hear interview 1.

18:41.325 --> 18:42.232
<i>Anything...</i>

18:42.274 --> 18:44.706
<i>Anything could happen as I
free-associate about the case.</i>

18:44.791 --> 18:47.000
<i>I could crack it wide open
just sitting here in this room.</i>

18:48.247 --> 18:50.545
And then click this to hear interview 2.

18:52.326 --> 18:55.145
Oh, for heaven's sakes. We're
running an asylum in here.

18:55.467 --> 18:56.510
Thank you, Buzz.

18:57.019 --> 18:59.830
In between the crying and
screaming, she said, yes,

18:59.872 --> 19:02.324
she is this Pappas woman's
assistant, and, yes,

19:02.366 --> 19:03.725
she worked on the guy's show.

19:06.524 --> 19:09.822
And she also drives
a company BMW, black.

19:12.902 --> 19:14.084
Afternoon, people.

19:14.339 --> 19:15.737
Well, Special Agent Howard.

19:17.145 --> 19:18.361
So...

19:19.074 --> 19:20.846
What can you tell us about our victim?

19:22.759 --> 19:23.829
Three years ago,

19:23.913 --> 19:26.941
Three years ago,the FBI began
investigating Mark Bernstein's company,

19:27.150 --> 19:28.750
intriguing endeavors,

19:29.100 --> 19:31.419
because of questionable release forms

19:31.503 --> 19:34.782
he and his brother obtained from
the women featured in his web videos.

19:35.276 --> 19:36.734
Two of the girls were underage,

19:36.776 --> 19:39.235
several were too drunk to
know what they were doing.

19:39.277 --> 19:41.218
Part of Intrigue's deal in making

19:41.260 --> 19:43.882
this new television show
was stopping all of that.

19:43.924 --> 19:45.892
- So they went legit.
- As far as we can tell.

19:46.107 --> 19:47.852
But... with Mark Bernstein gone...

19:47.938 --> 19:50.924
All cash coming in goes to
the surving brother, yes.

19:52.359 --> 19:55.154
Chief, the victim's computer...
I think it could tell us a lot,

19:55.196 --> 19:58.691
but someone added a boot password
blocking access to Intrigue's files.

19:59.031 --> 20:02.284
- I'd guess Detective Tracy...
- He's not a Detective, Lieutenant.

20:03.156 --> 20:05.912
But who is he? Sergeant
gabriel, do we know yet?

20:06.167 --> 20:09.665
Fingerprints say his real
name is Jonathan Baird.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.863
He's age 36, he's got
no criminal record,

20:11.905 --> 20:14.212
no financial connection
to the Bernsteins.

20:14.532 --> 20:18.508
He's worked for a variety of security
companies over the past 10 years,

20:18.738 --> 20:21.136
fired each time for doing
his job a little too well.

20:22.218 --> 20:25.737
He took the LAPD Academy
entrance exam twice,

20:25.779 --> 20:29.144
scored extremely high, but was never
admitted due to psychological issues.

20:29.439 --> 20:30.471
There's a shock.

20:30.667 --> 20:32.975
Now... about his witness statements.

20:33.482 --> 20:35.984
The good news is his
handwriting is impeccable.

20:36.260 --> 20:38.668
The bad news is everything's
written in this bizarre code

20:38.710 --> 20:40.213
I think only he can decipher.

20:43.046 --> 20:44.409
Thank you. Lieutenant.

20:45.923 --> 20:46.912
Finally.

20:47.179 --> 20:49.547
You know, I feel incredibly
underappreciated right now.

20:49.589 --> 20:50.916
Do you, Mr. Baird?

20:51.710 --> 20:53.336
That is your name, isn't it?

20:53.378 --> 20:55.670
Are we really gonna sit
here and debate my identity,

20:55.755 --> 20:57.505
or are we going to arrest a killer?

20:57.770 --> 20:59.862
You know, if we don't catch
him in the first 48 hours,

20:59.904 --> 21:01.760
our chances of success
go down dramatically!

21:01.984 --> 21:04.763
- We are losing time, people!
- We're not losing any time.

21:05.203 --> 21:06.921
<i>You have all the time in the world.</i>

21:06.963 --> 21:09.267
<i>Give me one good reason why I
shouldn't arrest you for murder.</i>

21:10.310 --> 21:12.854
Okay. How about this? I didn't do it!

21:13.088 --> 21:14.064
And, by the way,

21:14.148 --> 21:16.775
while I'm on duty, could you
please refer to me as "Detective"?

21:17.098 --> 21:19.123
You know, if you spent
a little more time

21:19.165 --> 21:23.016
investigating and just a little
less time arresting fellow officers,

21:23.176 --> 21:25.700
you would know by now that
the killer drives a black BMW,

21:26.127 --> 21:28.512
whereas we all drive crown vics.

21:29.691 --> 21:31.706
Why were you at the crime
scene in the first place?

21:32.185 --> 21:35.350
Well, I guess I saw some
black-and-whites there, and I thought,

21:35.392 --> 21:37.337
"why don't I show a
little bit of initiative?"

21:37.379 --> 21:40.591
<i>I got to tell you, Chief Pope was a
lot more impressed with me than you are.</i>

21:42.295 --> 21:43.928
I need the names of the witnesses.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.827
They're on page 17
of my official report.

21:45.869 --> 21:47.508
You're not writing an official report!

21:47.550 --> 21:50.266
No, I'm not, am I?! That's because
I'm handcuffed to this chair!

21:50.731 --> 21:53.136
I am not gonna let the two of
you blow this investigation!

21:53.178 --> 21:55.699
I am way farther along
on this than you are.

21:55.741 --> 21:56.976
You want to know why?

21:57.018 --> 21:58.817
Because I move like lightning.

21:59.057 --> 22:01.820
I turn on a dime. I fly like the wind.

22:02.186 --> 22:04.514
Did you see how fast I
served that search warrant?

22:04.616 --> 22:07.283
That's because we actually have
to get a judge to sign them!

22:07.368 --> 22:09.286
And tell me this.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.383
The woman that our victim
was seen with last night...

22:11.425 --> 22:14.256
Does she or does she
not drive a black BMW,

22:14.455 --> 22:15.583
just like our killer?

22:15.667 --> 22:16.689
Yes or no?

22:16.731 --> 22:19.129
You don't get to ask
questions around here... we do!

22:19.232 --> 22:21.089
- Lieutenant Flynn.
- Yes?

22:23.852 --> 22:25.533
Look, look... Just...

22:31.117 --> 22:32.231
Detective.

22:33.519 --> 22:36.802
You turn on a dime. You move like
lightning. You fly like the wind.

22:37.348 --> 22:40.025
Do you actually have a
theory about this crime?

22:40.109 --> 22:40.859
Chief!

22:41.071 --> 22:44.148
Look, Lieutenant, this
man has been places

22:44.190 --> 22:46.270
we have not and done
things we cannot do,

22:47.043 --> 22:49.534
including interviewing the witnesses.

22:49.788 --> 22:51.786
Maybe you could bring us up to speed.

22:52.245 --> 22:53.455
How about it...

22:53.920 --> 22:54.756
Dick?

23:06.526 --> 23:07.970
A parking garage...

23:08.251 --> 23:09.012
Cold,

23:09.652 --> 23:10.595
dank,

23:10.973 --> 23:12.171
unforgiving,

23:12.469 --> 23:14.851
as mundane as evil itself, and yet...

23:15.359 --> 23:17.770
Detective, just the
fact pattern, please.

23:18.587 --> 23:21.281
I have to set the right tone!

23:27.661 --> 23:31.657
We may never know exactly what
Mark Bernstein, A.K.A. Intrigue,

23:31.699 --> 23:33.841
was thinking as he walked

23:33.883 --> 23:37.277
from the structure's
single stairwell to his BMW,

23:37.319 --> 23:40.001
parked in this unassigned guest spot

23:40.086 --> 23:41.918
on parking level 2 of 3.

23:41.960 --> 23:44.756
Do all the parking levels
have unassigned guest spaces?

23:45.173 --> 23:47.319
That's a very astute
question, my latino friend.

23:47.642 --> 23:50.678
<i>The answer is si, absolutamente.</i>

23:52.861 --> 23:54.349
Which is "yes, absolutely".

23:55.695 --> 23:59.629
Clearly, our killer
recognized our victim's car.

23:59.790 --> 24:01.147
Bernstein walked here.

24:02.048 --> 24:03.546
And our shooter,

24:03.817 --> 24:06.524
standing here, judging by where
the casings landed here and here,

24:06.566 --> 24:07.876
likely called his name.

24:07.918 --> 24:09.906
Might have sounded like, "hey, Intrigue!

24:10.949 --> 24:11.991
Is that you?!"

24:12.993 --> 24:14.244
So the victim turned.

24:14.760 --> 24:15.976
The shooter fired...

24:17.179 --> 24:17.997
One hit,

24:18.957 --> 24:22.085
one hot slug of lead
squarely penetrating...

24:22.405 --> 24:23.545
The victim's forehead.

24:28.321 --> 24:31.302
Excuse me. Who was the first eyewitness?

24:31.883 --> 24:35.473
A Miss Sue Jamison of apartment 515

24:35.557 --> 24:38.539
was gingerly descending the stairwell
when she heard those two gunshots...

24:40.913 --> 24:44.524
Seconds later, a thin
woman of about average

24:44.608 --> 24:45.983
height fled past her,

24:46.263 --> 24:48.894
ostensibly on her way up to the street.

24:49.048 --> 24:51.114
Am I boring you,

24:51.198 --> 24:52.374
Officer?!

24:54.645 --> 24:56.953
Chief, ballistics confirms the
gun found at the crime scene

24:57.038 --> 24:58.830
matches bullets and casings.

24:59.029 --> 25:00.134
Thank you, sergeant.

25:00.176 --> 25:02.208
Detective, would you
please continue, quickly?

25:04.030 --> 25:05.259
Three minutes later,

25:05.301 --> 25:08.423
a glenn ramsdale spies
a late-model black BMW

25:08.508 --> 25:10.574
stopping behind the building.

25:10.616 --> 25:12.994
Something falls out of
the driver's-side window.

25:13.664 --> 25:15.180
It's a gun. And...

25:16.096 --> 25:18.615
we've just confirmed the murder weapon.

25:18.826 --> 25:21.852
Thank you so much,
Detective. So, clearly, our...

25:21.894 --> 25:23.771
Our killer knew both
the building's layout

25:23.855 --> 25:26.982
and that our victim was
sleeping with Ms. Morgan.

25:27.234 --> 25:30.574
And next, if you look at the TV
show that our victim was working on,

25:30.616 --> 25:34.620
I think you'll be exactly halfway
to understanding the killer's motive.

25:34.866 --> 25:37.327
You know, even if a
computer won't boot up,

25:37.635 --> 25:40.067
you should probably still empty

25:40.452 --> 25:41.643
the "D" drive.

25:42.499 --> 25:44.373
You never know what you
might find, Lieutenant.

26:01.893 --> 26:04.573
Buzz, could you fast-forward
to the actual content?

26:04.615 --> 26:05.461
Yes, ma'am.

26:07.347 --> 26:09.817
We've all seen how an
inexperienced P.U.A.

26:09.901 --> 26:11.602
Approaches an S.H.B.

26:11.644 --> 26:14.037
And how quickly things will go wrong.

26:14.239 --> 26:15.079
P.U.A.

26:15.198 --> 26:16.263
Pick-up artist.

26:16.305 --> 26:18.541
S.H.B. Smokin' hot babe, Chief.

26:18.583 --> 26:20.286
<i>Do you believe in love at first sight?</i>

26:20.477 --> 26:22.087
Or should I walk in again?

26:27.731 --> 26:29.170
<i>You see, a master P.U.A.</i>

26:29.255 --> 26:31.172
<i>will start instantly
with a little "physo"...</i>

26:31.367 --> 26:32.423
<i>Physical contact.</i>

26:32.645 --> 26:34.749
<i>He'll then use words like "hard" and</i>

26:34.997 --> 26:36.886
<i>"penetrate" in the conversation...</i>

26:37.059 --> 26:39.347
Oh, my lord. This man is horrible.

26:39.431 --> 26:40.807
<i>Sexual charge.</i>

26:40.892 --> 26:42.600
<i>Let's take a look at the master at work.</i>

26:54.571 --> 26:57.573
- Fast-forward a bit more,
Buzz. - With pleasure.

27:03.955 --> 27:07.040
He's recording all this
with his cellphone, Chief.

27:07.689 --> 27:09.711
Let's slow it down again, Buzz.

27:15.573 --> 27:17.885
That is disgusting.

27:18.105 --> 27:21.389
<i>A clean getaway means
no one gets woken up.</i>

27:21.473 --> 27:22.924
<i>That's why my car...</i>

27:24.565 --> 27:25.685
<i>Has a silent alarm.</i>

27:27.468 --> 27:30.565
<i>We all know my pickup was
successful, but was our S.H.B.</i>

27:30.831 --> 27:33.499
<i>feft unaware of what
exactly had taken place?</i>

27:33.541 --> 27:34.807
<i>Let's take a look.</i>

27:40.554 --> 27:43.619
<i>So, he slept with me,
he snuck out on me,</i>

27:44.382 --> 27:48.373
<i>- and he videotaped it all?
- Yep! That's what he does.</i>

27:48.583 --> 27:50.918
<i>I'm gonna take **** his little ****</i>

27:51.117 --> 27:53.003
<i>and I'm ****gonna *** cut it off!</i>

27:53.353 --> 27:54.804
<i>Stop the camera!</i>

27:55.841 --> 27:57.550
Buzz. I think we've seen enough of this.

27:58.510 --> 28:02.096
According to the website, slag tv
shot eight episodes of "tapped. "

28:02.333 --> 28:04.599
He did this to eight women,
and he only got shot once?

28:06.067 --> 28:07.867
Look. Detec...

28:10.188 --> 28:13.305
You said that this show would take
us exactly halfway to our motive.

28:13.347 --> 28:16.027
What is on Intrigue's computer
that will give us the other half?

28:17.130 --> 28:18.384
If I tell you that...

28:19.538 --> 28:21.052
Can I transfer to your squad?

28:23.971 --> 28:24.786
Of course.

28:25.204 --> 28:27.121
We'd be so happy to have you.

28:27.859 --> 28:29.248
Oh, my god.

28:30.250 --> 28:31.501
I'm one of the guys!

28:34.128 --> 28:35.434
I mean, this is...

28:35.753 --> 28:37.317
I... well, first of all,

28:37.359 --> 28:39.759
let me thank you for
acknowledging my... my good work.

28:40.552 --> 28:43.971
And secondly, I'm gonna need a
badge and a gun, 'cause you know,

28:44.056 --> 28:45.681
I left mine at home, so...

28:51.933 --> 28:54.148
- You're lying to me.
- So hard to believe.

28:54.440 --> 28:57.219
You never had any intention of
transferring me to Major Crimes?

28:57.261 --> 29:00.606
Lieutenant, would you please take
Detective Tracy to the interview room?

29:00.648 --> 29:02.456
After everything I've
done for you people?!

29:02.498 --> 29:04.315
I demand to see my union rep right now!

29:04.357 --> 29:07.856
- You don't have a union rep!
- No wonder I'm so poorly represented.

29:11.748 --> 29:12.765
Chief. Chief.

29:13.226 --> 29:16.910
I've got the eight women from
"tapped" in the conference room.

29:17.121 --> 29:19.519
They all say they have no idea
where Intrigue was last night.

29:19.561 --> 29:21.397
And believe me when I tell you,

29:21.511 --> 29:24.094
- not one of them wants to be here.
- I understand, sergeant.

29:24.187 --> 29:27.536
Let's put 4 of them in interview room
1 and four of them in interview 2.

29:27.797 --> 29:30.101
Hello?! Officer needing assistance!

29:30.185 --> 29:32.361
And what about our...

29:32.565 --> 29:34.939
Crazy screaming lady, Marie Morgan?

29:35.023 --> 29:38.119
Add her to the line up when I ask you
to, please, but not a minute before.

29:38.161 --> 29:39.087
Thanks.

29:39.129 --> 29:41.209
Chief, this is Ms. Jamison.

29:41.383 --> 29:43.854
She's our eyewitness from the stairwell.

29:43.896 --> 29:45.003
Yes. Of course.

29:45.045 --> 29:47.635
Lieutenant, would you please
escort Ms. Jamison to your desk,

29:47.677 --> 29:49.704
where she can observe the
lineup from your computer?

29:49.788 --> 29:51.824
- Yes, ma'am. This way.
- Thanks.

29:54.195 --> 29:55.869
Good luck solving this puzzle

29:55.962 --> 29:58.004
while I have the password
to the victim's computer.

29:59.756 --> 30:02.745
Mr. Baird, this is not a
game where one of us says,

30:02.787 --> 30:05.401
"it was done in the library with
a candlestick by colonel mustard. "

30:05.911 --> 30:09.747
In fact, I may end up arresting
you as an accessory after the fact.

30:10.628 --> 30:12.894
Don't you ever get tired of
always playing the bad cop?

30:18.873 --> 30:20.943
Look, if you're still
worried about this morning,

30:21.566 --> 30:24.383
I believe we're close to resolving
this case, and when we do,

30:24.425 --> 30:27.492
any unintentional oversights
won't make a bit of difference.

30:27.577 --> 30:31.522
How can you say that?
Sooner or later, "Dick Tracy"

30:32.241 --> 30:35.689
is gonna have to go to court and
testify that I handed all the evidence,

30:35.731 --> 30:38.452
including a loaded gun, to him...

30:38.849 --> 30:41.464
a civilian with psychiatric issues.

30:41.549 --> 30:44.033
So, no matter how this
turns out, I'm screwed.

30:45.038 --> 30:46.135
Maybe not.

30:49.681 --> 30:51.480
I could really use your
help with something.

30:51.522 --> 30:52.391
Okay. What?

30:55.287 --> 30:56.601
What now, blondie?

31:00.401 --> 31:04.356
Detective Tracy, I'm fairly certain
I know who killed Mark Bernstein,

31:04.398 --> 31:07.013
and in a short time, I
expect to confirm that belief.

31:10.879 --> 31:12.567
That said

31:12.939 --> 31:16.128
I'm lacking evidence
establishing a compelling motive,

31:16.376 --> 31:18.125
which I will need to
obtain my confession.

31:18.884 --> 31:20.962
So, if you are in
possession of that evidence,

31:21.046 --> 31:23.881
I order you to hand
it over this instant,

31:24.035 --> 31:26.501
including the password that you
attached to the victim's computer.

31:26.543 --> 31:28.747
You've made it pretty clear
that I don't work for you,

31:28.974 --> 31:31.503
so that order doesn't
really mean anything.

31:32.168 --> 31:35.518
I think I'm not gonna give you that
password because you're not my boss.

31:35.848 --> 31:37.024
But I am, Detective.

31:38.264 --> 31:40.273
- You work for me.
- I do?

31:40.357 --> 31:41.440
Yes, you do.

31:42.712 --> 31:44.902
And I recognize that
Chief Johnson's behavior

31:45.267 --> 31:48.282
has been an affront to your
diligent investigative work.

31:49.724 --> 31:52.452
Chief Johnson seems intent
on maintaining her division...

31:53.352 --> 31:56.181
While at the same time dividing herself

31:56.727 --> 31:57.894
against...

31:59.234 --> 32:00.250
Herself.

32:00.919 --> 32:03.588
- Chief Pope!
- I'm sorry, Chief, it had to be said.

32:05.200 --> 32:07.408
There is justice, there is the law,

32:08.539 --> 32:10.553
and there is the power
that sustains them both.

32:12.142 --> 32:15.847
That password is a crucial element
in the solving of this case.

32:17.710 --> 32:20.563
And Detective Tracy here seems to
understand that better than you do.

32:21.898 --> 32:23.270
Isn't that right, Detective?

32:28.155 --> 32:29.654
Crimestoppers.

32:30.227 --> 32:31.115
I'm sorry.

32:31.592 --> 32:34.538
That's the password that I
put on the victim's computer.

32:34.580 --> 32:35.815
It's "crimestoppers. "

32:36.084 --> 32:38.045
Do I really have to
tell you guyseverything?

32:44.000 --> 32:45.046
I think I know her.

32:47.326 --> 32:49.783
Lieutenant Tao, just go to recent...

32:50.138 --> 32:51.469
- Documents?
- Yes, please.

32:52.929 --> 32:55.484
- Know her from where?
- The motor pool, I think.

32:55.526 --> 32:57.017
Here we go, Chief.

33:04.045 --> 33:06.317
Chief, jill pappas is waiting
in the electronics room.

33:06.402 --> 33:07.825
Thank you, Buzz.

33:08.194 --> 33:09.166
Lieutenant Tao.

33:09.877 --> 33:11.656
It's printing out right now.

33:15.338 --> 33:17.572
Ms. Pappas, thank you for coming in.

33:17.973 --> 33:21.135
Lieutenant Flynn, Detective Sanchez,
please have the women face forward.

33:21.177 --> 33:22.967
<i>Could you line up
against the wall, please?</i>

33:23.009 --> 33:24.294
<i>Look in that direction.</i>

33:25.503 --> 33:26.796
I'll go in closer.

33:29.758 --> 33:33.284
That's Gail McDonald. She
was a particularly bad sport.

33:33.326 --> 33:35.046
During our video follow-up session,

33:35.088 --> 33:37.225
she made overt threats toward Intrigue.

33:37.267 --> 33:39.140
It got quite ugly.

33:39.612 --> 33:42.537
Now, Ms. Pappas I have
a bad surprise for you.

33:42.579 --> 33:44.852
Buzz, would you please
ask Sergeant Gabriel

33:44.894 --> 33:47.399
- to bring in our last subject?
- Sergeant Gabriel, now.

33:48.485 --> 33:50.445
<i>This will all be over in a few minutes.</i>

33:50.487 --> 33:53.051
<i>If you'd just have a seat
right over here, thank you.</i>

33:54.069 --> 33:57.019
<i>Just try to calm down. Stay calm.
Everything's just fine, all right?</i>

33:57.061 --> 34:00.633
That's... that's my assistant, Marie.
I've been trying to reach her all day.

34:04.431 --> 34:06.877
If she was sleeping with
Intrigue, why would she murder him?

34:06.961 --> 34:10.007
Well, maybe she got jealous of all
the other women he was "tapping. "

34:10.049 --> 34:12.507
No, but that was all part of the
show. Marie knew that going in.

34:13.083 --> 34:14.509
She also had opportunity.

34:14.896 --> 34:17.228
She was in the building
where Intrigue was murdered,

34:17.271 --> 34:21.188
and she drove a black BMW identical
to the one used by the killer.

34:21.560 --> 34:24.216
No. Our production company leases
half a dozen of them just like hers,

34:24.257 --> 34:26.039
including the one that Intrigue drove.

34:26.148 --> 34:28.539
And Intrigue's brother
also drove a black BMW?

34:28.581 --> 34:30.943
That was our contract for as long
as the show was in production.

34:31.027 --> 34:32.820
And he also had a crush on Marie.

34:32.905 --> 34:34.016
That went nowhere.

34:34.469 --> 34:36.239
Well, look, Ms. Pappas,
all I need to know

34:36.324 --> 34:37.949
is if you'd be willing to testify

34:38.034 --> 34:40.828
about Ms. Morgan's ongoing
affair with Intrigue.

34:44.667 --> 34:47.579
All right, yes. If you
really think it's germane,

34:47.621 --> 34:49.628
yes, I will testify.

34:51.398 --> 34:52.327
It's just...

34:52.708 --> 34:53.799
- God.
- What?

34:54.603 --> 34:57.011
It's just gonna be hell to
replace Marie mid-season.

34:59.017 --> 35:01.288
- Chief, are you seeing this?
- Yes. Ms. Pappas,

35:01.330 --> 35:04.416
if you wouldn't mind going in
and calming Ms. Morgan down?

35:04.458 --> 35:07.264
Just place her in the center of
the room in front of our cameras,

35:07.306 --> 35:09.680
- and we'll get this over with.
- I'll do what I can.

35:16.460 --> 35:19.169
Jill! Jill! I didn't kill
him! I didn't kill him!

35:19.211 --> 35:21.285
Marie, Marie, take it
easy. Take it easy. Breathe.

35:24.057 --> 35:25.746
Chief, you have your I.D.

35:33.884 --> 35:36.467
All right! I guess I'm free to go, huh?

35:36.839 --> 35:38.207
Yeah. No.

35:40.031 --> 35:42.139
But I do think you deserve
to see this confession.

35:42.697 --> 35:43.616
Come on.

35:44.183 --> 35:46.288
Relax. Marie, you must relax.

35:46.788 --> 35:49.647
Sergeant Gabriel, would you escort
these lovely ladies out of the room?

35:50.279 --> 35:51.433
Have a seat.

35:54.393 --> 35:56.195
<i>Right his way, ladies, please.</i>

35:56.403 --> 35:58.823
Thank you for your time.
Sorry about the inconvenience.

36:02.104 --> 36:04.286
Except for you, Ms.
Pappas. You can stay.

36:05.035 --> 36:06.705
I'm sorry? Did I Miss something here?

36:06.790 --> 36:09.094
Lieutenant Flynn, would you
please read Ms. Pappas her rights?

36:09.136 --> 36:11.502
- You have the right to remain silent.
- You think I killed him?

36:11.544 --> 36:13.737
- If you give up the right to remain...
- That's absurd.

36:13.779 --> 36:15.422
- Anything you...
- I know my rights.

36:15.506 --> 36:17.549
I produced three seasons
of "Homicide P.I."

36:17.591 --> 36:19.760
I don't want or need an attorney

36:20.595 --> 36:24.593
because you have absolutely nothing
linking me to Intrigue's death.

36:25.307 --> 36:27.863
You knew that your assistant
marie was sleeping with Intrigue,

36:27.905 --> 36:29.451
which means you also knew

36:29.493 --> 36:31.449
that he'd be leaving her
apartment this morning.

36:31.697 --> 36:33.832
'cause that's one of
his rules, isn't it?

36:33.874 --> 36:36.527
Never take the smokin' hot
babe back to your own house?

36:37.093 --> 36:39.525
You also had access to
half a dozen cars identical

36:39.567 --> 36:41.003
to the one used by our killer.

36:41.045 --> 36:43.425
And our Detectives are
combing through yours

36:43.467 --> 36:45.719
as we speak for gunshot residue.

36:45.887 --> 36:47.705
Bet you we'd find some
on her arms right now.

36:48.214 --> 36:51.083
Not to mention you
lied to us repeatedly.

36:51.405 --> 36:54.612
You said that "tapped" was going
to be a gigantic hit, when, in fact,

36:54.654 --> 36:57.047
you knew it was about
to explode in your face.

36:58.174 --> 37:01.260
Your own audience testing, which we
just printed off of Intrigue's laptop

37:01.345 --> 37:03.336
showed that they didn't
just hate the show,

37:03.378 --> 37:06.765
they loathed the concept and the star.

37:07.449 --> 37:08.802
Lowest scores on record.

37:08.844 --> 37:11.478
When you said "off the charts,"
you weren't just kidding around.

37:11.563 --> 37:13.171
And, by the way, there's an eyewitnes

37:13.213 --> 37:15.190
who actually saw you
running from the crime scene.

37:15.705 --> 37:17.238
All of this evidence proves

37:17.361 --> 37:20.342
that you murdered Mark
Bernstein to save your career.

37:20.384 --> 37:21.530
Is that not right?!

37:25.331 --> 37:28.119
When I first signed
Intrigue to do the show,

37:28.216 --> 37:31.070
I thought he had a
likable vulnerability.

37:31.479 --> 37:33.077
Turns out, on camera,

37:33.405 --> 37:35.996
he comes off like a
psychopathic predator.

37:38.968 --> 37:41.808
I told him he'd have
to change his approach.

37:43.178 --> 37:45.246
Did you think he was
gonna take notes from me?

37:46.809 --> 37:48.682
You killed him because
he wouldn't take notes?

37:49.415 --> 37:52.127
I explained to him
that the show's failure

37:52.412 --> 37:53.771
would destroy me.

37:53.963 --> 37:55.564
But it didn't matter to him.

37:55.912 --> 37:59.067
Because his web business
would only continue to grow.

37:59.661 --> 38:02.613
He'd screwed me and
was ready to move on,

38:02.899 --> 38:04.990
just like every other
woman he'd ever come across.

38:05.803 --> 38:08.372
He'd make millions

38:08.793 --> 38:10.283
while I'd be fighting

38:10.325 --> 38:13.666
to get a job as Paula
Abdul's personal assistant.

38:14.690 --> 38:16.154
Does that seem fair to you?!

38:16.502 --> 38:19.403
Geez, this is just a TV
show we're talking about...

38:19.679 --> 38:21.780
On basic cable, for Christ's sakes.

38:21.927 --> 38:23.467
Couldn't you have just canceled it?

38:26.408 --> 38:27.308
I did...

38:28.864 --> 38:30.513
With extreme prejudice.

38:31.494 --> 38:33.381
Chief johnson's not bad, you know?

38:33.786 --> 38:35.315
Yeah, she's the real deal.

38:37.785 --> 38:38.935
Ms. Pappas...

38:40.325 --> 38:41.773
you just tapped out.

38:48.076 --> 38:49.533
"What I witnessed

38:49.812 --> 38:50.775
next... "

38:50.817 --> 38:52.425
No. I'm not a witness.

38:52.467 --> 38:56.333
"What I saw next made the
hair on the back of my neck

38:56.651 --> 38:58.836
stand up straight. "

38:58.974 --> 39:01.157
- "Not the big hairs, like the... "
- for the last time,

39:01.199 --> 39:03.156
will you knock it off over there?!

39:04.343 --> 39:07.269
Make sure to include the witness
statements in your report, Detective.

39:07.804 --> 39:10.076
Okay, does anybody
have a mirror, please,

39:10.118 --> 39:13.164
so I can see if I have the word
"rookie" tattooed on my forehead?

39:13.206 --> 39:15.057
Witness statements go
in a separate appendix.

39:15.099 --> 39:17.604
Yes, they do. And don't forget
about the search warrant.

39:17.916 --> 39:20.691
And please itemize all the evidence that
you took from the victim's apartment.

39:20.775 --> 39:22.457
- And...
- Okay, excuse me. Excuse me.

39:22.499 --> 39:24.667
Do I tell you how to do your job?

39:29.952 --> 39:32.844
You're having him write
a final report because...?

39:32.886 --> 39:35.080
When he says he served a search warrant,

39:35.164 --> 39:37.310
it means that he forged legal paperwork.

39:37.352 --> 39:39.877
When he entered the victim's
apartment, he trespassed.

39:39.962 --> 39:42.987
Removing evidence is
burglary, and so on and so on.

39:43.359 --> 39:44.131
And...

39:46.040 --> 39:48.427
when he signs it, it's
officially his confession.

39:48.511 --> 39:51.472
And his defense. It's proof
that he's a total crackpot.

39:51.556 --> 39:53.827
Psychiatric services
will make that evaluation.

39:54.026 --> 39:57.097
And then I'll be halfway
to saving Chief Pope's job.

39:57.139 --> 40:00.431
Speaking of which, gentlemen,
how's your official report coming?

40:00.473 --> 40:03.734
- You want to read it before?
- No, no. You can just send it upstairs.

40:04.569 --> 40:07.321
- Where's the dvd of the show's pilot?
- Got it right here, Chief.

40:09.323 --> 40:10.403
Where you taking it?

40:11.433 --> 40:14.161
I think the district attorney
ought to have a gander.

40:16.692 --> 40:19.416
No, "en route"
is E-N, not O-N.

40:22.518 --> 40:23.837
Mind Your own business...

40:24.621 --> 40:25.330
Dick.

40:29.445 --> 40:30.233
Yeah?

40:33.404 --> 40:34.768
Reading anything good?

40:34.810 --> 40:36.885
Yeah, a marvelous new work of fiction...

40:36.927 --> 40:40.571
Flynn and Provenza's account
of today's adventures.

40:41.638 --> 40:44.592
Even if this does become the
accepted version of events,

40:45.038 --> 40:46.627
it all goes out the window when...

40:47.059 --> 40:49.879
"Dick Tracy" is taken
out of his padded room,

40:49.999 --> 40:51.454
puts his right hand up at trial,

40:51.496 --> 40:53.703
and testifies that I handed him the gun

40:53.745 --> 40:56.878
and the casings and sent
him on his merry way.

40:56.920 --> 40:58.372
Not if it doesn't go to trial.

40:59.862 --> 41:00.942
What do you mean?

41:02.301 --> 41:05.888
I had planned to show deputy
D. A. Garnett the entire pilot,

41:05.930 --> 41:08.608
but it only took three minutes
for him to realize that our

41:08.855 --> 41:10.884
victim is as despicable as our killer.

41:11.225 --> 41:14.721
So, we both agreed that a plea to life
would be a most reasonable outcome.

41:17.199 --> 41:19.048
But what will your division think of me

41:19.090 --> 41:22.396
if I submit this untruthful
report to the Chief?

41:22.685 --> 41:25.964
That you are exactly who
you said you wanted to be...

41:26.101 --> 41:27.275
Just one of the guys.

41:27.934 --> 41:29.286
Well, what does that mean?

41:31.046 --> 41:32.364
We lie to you all the time.

41:32.907 --> 41:34.229
Everybody does.

41:34.271 --> 41:37.573
Robbery homicide, vice,
narcotics, even traffic.

41:38.632 --> 41:42.279
It's the one thing that unites
every division of the LAPD. We...

41:43.794 --> 41:45.171
We all lie to our boss.

41:45.643 --> 41:48.162
I don't... what am I
supposed to say to that?

41:48.830 --> 41:50.604
- What, "thank you"?
- You're welcome.

41:51.759 --> 41:52.642
And...

41:52.952 --> 41:55.421
As far as the respect that my...

41:55.880 --> 41:57.146
division has for you,

41:57.478 --> 41:59.565
I can assure you, Will,

41:59.714 --> 42:02.852
that no thing has changed
from yesterday to today.

42:05.534 --> 42:07.489
- Honestly?
- Honestly.

42:10.086 --> 42:12.022
So, nighty-night...

42:12.580 --> 42:13.530
crimestopper.
