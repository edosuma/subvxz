WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:05.280
Talitha Campbell, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of malicious
communication.

00:05.280 --> 00:09.440
Anything I need to know?
She's a rude, entitled little cow.

00:09.440 --> 00:11.600
So...you know Hannah Ellis?

00:11.600 --> 00:14.200
Yeah, it was just a few
stupid texts. No big deal.

00:14.200 --> 00:18.360
"It won't cost me much to have
some crackhead sort you out."

00:18.360 --> 00:21.400
That's Troy Manners. Now,
he could be Talitha's crackhead.

00:22.920 --> 00:26.840
If Talitha Campbell commissioned
an attack on Hannah,

00:26.840 --> 00:30.000
he fits the bill perfectly.
You're in trouble here.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.760
I may not want my parents involved,

00:31.760 --> 00:34.600
but you're not the only lawyer
in town.

00:34.600 --> 00:37.640
They haven't told you who my dad is?

00:37.640 --> 00:40.880
Sir Damian Campbell.
The property developer.

00:40.880 --> 00:43.040
Every time Talitha got into trouble
at school,

00:43.040 --> 00:45.640
you became involved in some way.
Well, I'm not.

00:47.560 --> 00:49.000
Call me back, Talitha.

00:50.720 --> 00:54.520
So she was gagged and strangled
with a green scarf.

00:54.520 --> 00:57.840
You are now being arrested
on suspicion of murder.

00:57.840 --> 01:00.080
La la la la la la la la la la la.

01:00.080 --> 01:04.080
It was her, James.
She's wearing the murder weapon.

02:22.960 --> 02:25.680
Morning, Talitha.
Your solicitor's here.

02:35.960 --> 02:37.640
You sing to yourself.

02:37.640 --> 02:41.080
So what? Is that a crime?
I do it sometimes.

02:41.080 --> 02:43.920
Helps with the breathing
when I get nervous.

02:43.920 --> 02:48.040
I'm not nervous. I just want to
get out of this shithole. OK.

03:14.240 --> 03:17.640
So this is the last point
that Hannah was picked up.

03:17.640 --> 03:21.760
And also Talitha and her
housemate sometime later? Yes.

03:23.040 --> 03:24.360
Have you spoken to him yet?

03:24.360 --> 03:28.680
He's gone back to his family home
in London, but we will. Right, OK.

03:28.680 --> 03:32.000
That's the street where
all the press are.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.040
Well, you know her name's all over
social media, so you're going to
have to come down hard on this

03:36.040 --> 03:38.600
we're going to risk it...
I know, I know.

03:38.600 --> 03:43.720
How far is it walking from Talitha's
to Hannah's? Couple of minutes, max.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.080
Andy? I'm at Talitha's house
but there's nothing yet.

03:50.080 --> 03:52.240
Any fibres? We've got to link it.

03:52.240 --> 03:54.720
Yeah, forensics is still on it,
but no scarf.

03:54.720 --> 03:56.880
What about the clothes
she wore to the ball?

03:56.880 --> 03:59.800
I can't find a dress or jacket
that matches any of the footage.

03:59.800 --> 04:01.840
Right, well, keep looking.

04:01.840 --> 04:04.840
I'm just taking James down to the
crime scene. Well, make sure

04:04.840 --> 04:08.960
he doesn't fall in the docks
and get any wetter. Right.

04:08.960 --> 04:11.720
That was Andy. Well, I hope
your phone doesn't overheated

04:11.720 --> 04:14.880
with all that raw intellect
just surging through it.

04:14.880 --> 04:18.240
Sent his best to you, too.

04:18.240 --> 04:20.680
They haven't found the scarf
at Talitha's.

04:20.680 --> 04:25.280
Look, in truth, the scarf
throws up a lot of questions.

04:25.280 --> 04:29.320
Why would Talitha give her scarf
to somebody to carry out
a premeditated attack?

04:29.320 --> 04:31.800
It's hardly the weapon of choice
for a paid killer, is it? OK,

04:31.800 --> 04:34.560
we're still piecing things together,
let's not pick holes. I'm not

04:34.560 --> 04:38.120
picking, but looking for holes is
sadly part of my job description.

04:50.400 --> 04:53.080
So how are forensics coming along?

04:53.080 --> 04:56.520
Mixed bag. Her mum messed everything
up with the cleaning,

04:56.520 --> 05:01.040
but we do have a trace from the neck
of the vodka bottle. And?

05:01.040 --> 05:02.480
No match as yet.

05:08.680 --> 05:12.280
Forensics were testing
the disposal method.

05:12.280 --> 05:17.480
We think the body was put
in the sleeping bag inside

05:17.480 --> 05:20.040
then the killer wore the rucksack
with the kettlebell

05:20.040 --> 05:21.400
till he dragged it outside.

05:23.120 --> 05:28.840
We reckon he's dragging the bag
and wearing the rucksack. He stops.

05:30.200 --> 05:32.080
Puts the rucksack on her.

05:32.080 --> 05:34.280
Hauls her into the wheelie bin.

05:34.280 --> 05:35.800
Not too far to the boat yard,

05:35.800 --> 05:38.480
that time in the morning,
no eyewitnesses.

05:38.480 --> 05:39.960
Splash.

05:41.160 --> 05:44.480
Come on, I'll take you
down there now.

05:46.360 --> 05:50.360
So we reckon the bin
was dropped in here. Right.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.040
If you're still going with Troy
being the he

05:57.040 --> 05:59.400
I think you need Talitha
at the crime scene as well.

05:59.400 --> 06:02.560
I'm not ruling it out.
Have you got any evidence for it?

06:02.560 --> 06:06.880
Not at the moment. Well, you know
what Virginia Hoult's going to say
here, don't you?

06:09.040 --> 06:12.480
The scarf suggests that the killer
was Talitha herself and not Troy,

06:12.480 --> 06:15.840
but that then removes the evidential
importance of the text threats

06:15.840 --> 06:19.680
about getting a crackhead to sort
her. Unless she was there, too.

06:19.680 --> 06:23.600
Then they need evidence of both
Talitha and Troy at the crime scene.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.400
Forensics are still hoping
for fibres from the scarf

06:26.400 --> 06:30.360
in Talitha's house. Then there's
also the vodka bottle. Mm-hm.

06:30.360 --> 06:32.440
They have a DNA sample
from the neck of it.

06:32.440 --> 06:36.160
Does it match Talitha or Troy?
The room is noisy with DNA.

06:36.160 --> 06:37.600
They're working on it.

06:37.600 --> 06:40.080
Semen does last in water
so they're testing for that

06:40.080 --> 06:42.240
and also her blood for toxicology.

06:42.240 --> 06:44.400
And there are bruises
to her arms and thighs.

06:44.400 --> 06:47.880
Did the body get shifted
about in the water much? Yeah.

06:49.640 --> 06:51.000
I know.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.760
Have they extended? Yeah.
Then they haven't got long.

06:54.760 --> 06:58.320
Because this
is simply not enough, still.

06:58.320 --> 07:01.360
I did hint that you might see it
that way. Well, you were right.

07:01.360 --> 07:06.080
One last crack, James, then Talitha
and Troy are both out.

07:10.880 --> 07:15.240
You sleep? Like a baby.

07:16.360 --> 07:19.920
They have extended your custody
period to 36 hours.

07:19.920 --> 07:23.080
The police are obviously holding
things back, which is annoying,

07:23.080 --> 07:26.360
but not against the rules.
Is Troy still here?

07:26.360 --> 07:28.080
I thought you called him Mannys?!

07:28.080 --> 07:31.640
They'll do that as well,
and they'll try and annoy you

07:31.640 --> 07:33.800
because you tend to lash out
when that happens.

07:33.800 --> 07:37.120
Bollocks, Cleo, you can fuck
right off with that shit.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.680
Your dad came to see me.

07:44.680 --> 07:46.680
I bet he did.

07:46.680 --> 07:49.480
He wants to be involved.
Too late for that.

07:51.920 --> 07:54.680
Well, I said I'd tell you.
Duty done.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.280
I don't know your father, obviously.
You're right. You don't know him.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.040
Shall we move on?

08:05.520 --> 08:08.480
The reason there's no affordable
housing is not because we need

08:08.480 --> 08:10.760
more subsidies,
it's because we don't build enough

08:10.760 --> 08:13.400
and we don't build enough
because of planning regulations

08:13.400 --> 08:17.360
that are policed by an army
of Nimbys. Supply and demand.

08:17.360 --> 08:21.200
They're trying to get house
price inflation. Well, tough shit.

08:21.200 --> 08:25.200
I'd love to fly but I can't
because of gravity.

08:26.960 --> 08:29.680
Warming to your theme?

08:29.680 --> 08:34.400
I don't mind disagreements but...
stupidity is another matter.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.200
So what's happening?

08:40.880 --> 08:43.120
Brian's spoken to his source.

08:43.120 --> 08:46.040
The girl was strangled
and put inside a wheelie bin

08:46.040 --> 08:49.920
that was then chucked into the water
down by the boat yards.

08:49.920 --> 08:53.880
Jesus. And they really think
that Talitha...?

08:53.880 --> 08:56.600
Well...now there's the rub.

08:56.600 --> 08:59.640
Don't get fucking gnomic on me,
just answer the question.

08:59.640 --> 09:02.040
We're in an adjustment stage.

09:02.040 --> 09:05.280
Cos the evidence doesn't match
their original theory.

09:05.280 --> 09:07.240
Today will be crucial.

09:15.800 --> 09:20.240
Here we are, then.
Morning. Miss Roberts.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.040
So...

09:30.720 --> 09:33.440
This is South West Police
interviewing Talitha Campbell

09:33.440 --> 09:36.400
on suspicion of murder.
Conducting the interview

09:36.400 --> 09:39.160
are DI Paula Cassidy
and DC Andy Lowell.

09:39.160 --> 09:42.920
Also present is Miss Campbell's
solicitor Cleo Roberts.

09:42.920 --> 09:48.760
Interview commencing at...9:57am.

09:48.760 --> 09:50.760
So, where were we, then?

09:50.760 --> 09:55.320
Before we start, I'd like to make an
opening statement, for the record.

09:55.320 --> 09:56.680
Go right ahead.

09:56.680 --> 09:59.960
Now that my client has been
rearrested on suspicion of murder,

09:59.960 --> 10:02.280
we are on total reset.

10:02.280 --> 10:06.400
I'm not entirely sure how much legal
validity that has as a concept.

10:06.400 --> 10:08.360
Please don't interrupt me.

10:08.360 --> 10:10.800
Your technique was oppressive

10:10.800 --> 10:15.840
and involved a lot of psychological
speculation and trick questions.

10:15.840 --> 10:17.120
Try that approach again,

10:17.120 --> 10:20.760
and you can expect a very swift
intervention from me.

10:22.360 --> 10:24.520
Have you got that, DC Lowell?

10:24.520 --> 10:28.040
Uh, I got it, boss. Got it.

11:30.760 --> 11:34.560
Dillon. What are doing now?

11:34.560 --> 11:36.080
Come and dance.

11:38.040 --> 11:42.560
So...take us through
Talitha's ball, then.

11:42.560 --> 11:44.880
I genuinely don't remember so much.

11:44.880 --> 11:47.960
You were taking drugs?
Drinking mainly.

11:47.960 --> 11:49.760
But some drugs?

11:50.920 --> 11:55.520
Some cocaine, some MDMA,
some ketamine.

11:55.520 --> 11:58.680
Well, it's not a crime, is it?

11:58.680 --> 12:01.760
I forgot to add
unnecessary snarkiness.

12:01.760 --> 12:06.360
So tell us what you do remember
about your movements.

12:06.360 --> 12:10.640
I danced. I talked to some people.
Went on the Ferris wheel.

12:10.640 --> 12:14.400
Who were you mainly hanging out
with? My friend Dillon.

12:14.400 --> 12:17.600
Then I got a bit wobbly
and he went off somewhere.

12:17.600 --> 12:19.880
Dillon Harwood?

12:19.880 --> 12:23.320
We saw he's been texting you.
Well, makes sense.

12:23.320 --> 12:25.440
He never gives up until you answer.

12:25.440 --> 12:30.040
OK, well, we'll be checking in
with Dillon, of course.

12:30.040 --> 12:34.440
I doubt his memory will be
a whole lot better than mine. OK.

12:36.320 --> 12:40.320
We cool, Miss Roberts? Sure.

12:40.320 --> 12:43.720
So you didn't stay
for the survivors' photo?

12:43.720 --> 12:48.240
Christ, no. The ball itself was naff
enough. I only went last minute.

12:48.240 --> 12:50.840
Why? Something to do.

12:50.840 --> 12:55.880
And at around 3:00 in the morning,
you walked home.

12:55.880 --> 12:59.200
I have no idea what time it was,
to be honest.

12:59.200 --> 13:03.000
And what happened when you and
Dillon arrived back at home?

13:03.000 --> 13:06.040
Uh...we went to my room.

13:06.040 --> 13:08.960
We did some more drugs.

13:08.960 --> 13:12.680
And we slagged everybody off.
The usual.

13:12.680 --> 13:15.840
Did you have sex?
I said the usual.

13:15.840 --> 13:19.880
I don't think sex with Dillon
ever falls into that category. No?

13:20.920 --> 13:24.080
What's your idea of usual sex, then?

13:25.440 --> 13:28.240
Well, it's a bit early in the
morning for this kind of chat,

13:28.240 --> 13:31.880
but you go first. No offence,
I'm guessing you won't have
a lot to add here.

13:31.880 --> 13:34.320
May I have a minute
with my client, please?

13:36.840 --> 13:38.960
Yeah, of course.

13:38.960 --> 13:40.640
Thanks.

13:40.640 --> 13:44.960
Interview suspended 10:17am.

14:11.840 --> 14:16.240
Something's up. What? It's going
fine, I'm cooking on gas here.

14:16.240 --> 14:18.400
They're going to hit you
with something soon.

14:18.400 --> 14:21.760
I just want to warn you to be very
careful how you reply.

14:21.760 --> 14:25.480
Do not say anything
they can easily disprove.

14:25.480 --> 14:28.640
OK. Cut the silly backchat.

14:28.640 --> 14:30.960
What's usual sex for Cleo?

14:30.960 --> 14:34.840
Deliveroo and a hard-hitting documentary.

14:36.640 --> 14:39.360
I know flippancy
is a coping mechanism.

14:39.360 --> 14:42.840
But try not to overdo it.
Stick to the day job.

14:42.840 --> 14:46.160
I've seen much better shrinks
than you.

14:46.160 --> 14:47.760
Let's go.

15:12.520 --> 15:15.680
So...you fall asleep... Yeah.

15:15.680 --> 15:18.680
And when you wake up,
Dillon's headed back to his room.

15:18.680 --> 15:20.800
I assume so. Mm-hm.

15:20.800 --> 15:23.520
Were you still fully clothed?
This again.

15:23.520 --> 15:26.160
You have a one-track mind,
Detective.

15:26.160 --> 15:29.240
Did you dress up to go to the ball?
Did I what?

15:29.240 --> 15:32.360
Did you dress up?
Yeah, I went as Lady Gaga.

15:32.360 --> 15:36.200
No. Wait, a pirate.
What did you wear?

15:36.200 --> 15:39.600
A dress. Like most people.
It was a ball.

15:39.600 --> 15:43.280
Where is it now?
I don't know. At home, probably.

15:43.280 --> 15:46.040
We can't find it.
Or the jacket you wore.

15:46.040 --> 15:48.280
You searched my home?!
Where's your warrant?

15:48.280 --> 15:50.840
They don't need a warrant
once you've been arrested.

15:50.840 --> 15:53.000
Tell me that isn't,
like, total fascism.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.760
It's like section 18 of the 1984
Police and Criminal Evidence Act.

15:56.760 --> 16:00.880
1984, though.
Did you dispose of the clothes?

16:00.880 --> 16:01.920
Yeah.

16:03.120 --> 16:05.360
At the dry cleaners.

16:05.360 --> 16:08.720
Why did you take them there?
Are you for real?

16:08.720 --> 16:11.040
Why do you THINK I took them there?

16:12.080 --> 16:16.880
Well, honestly, I'm knackered
and these questions are just...

16:16.880 --> 16:19.720
Do you usually take your stuff
to the dry cleaners?

16:19.720 --> 16:24.560
When I've been sitting on the ground
and got them covered in vodka and
shit, yeah. You got a ticket?

16:24.560 --> 16:27.480
I don't need one. The guy knows me.

16:27.480 --> 16:30.240
So you use it a lot, then.
His name is Mustafa.

16:30.240 --> 16:33.800
He gives bags of Maltesers to little
kids, and he's not a nonce, either,

16:33.800 --> 16:38.560
just a nice old man who runs a dry
cleaners. Check it out. We will.

16:38.560 --> 16:41.880
Anything else? Anything else what?

16:41.880 --> 16:44.480
Were you wearing anything else?

16:44.480 --> 16:47.240
I definitely had shoes
and I think I put some knickers on.

16:47.240 --> 16:50.160
Where is all this going, DI Cassidy?

17:00.960 --> 17:02.480
Forget this.

17:10.800 --> 17:15.040
The scarf? That's not really
clothing. What is it, then?

17:15.040 --> 17:17.960
An accessory. An accessory to what?

17:17.960 --> 17:20.560
Oh, very good.
I see what you did there.

17:20.560 --> 17:24.680
What make of scarf is it? I don't
know. I got it in a charity shop.

17:24.680 --> 17:29.200
Can't find it in your flat.
Maybe I lost it. Where?

17:29.200 --> 17:31.680
If I knew that, it wouldn't be lost.

17:33.440 --> 17:38.400
You haven't asked me
how had Hannah died.

17:40.480 --> 17:44.040
It's not my job
to ask the questions.

17:44.040 --> 17:48.120
Well, we think she was strangled.

17:54.480 --> 17:57.080
What did you do
with the scarf afterwards?

17:57.080 --> 18:01.600
OK, you don't have to answer that.
I warned you about trick questions.

18:01.600 --> 18:05.000
Did you get rid of the scarf
after you help somebody throw
a body into the river? No.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.640
Did you go with Troy Manners
to Hannah's house at any time
the night of the ball?

18:09.640 --> 18:12.960
Can I just be clear what you're
seeking to ascertain here?

18:12.960 --> 18:17.240
You've previously suggested
that my client might have hired
Troy Manners to kill Hannah.

18:17.240 --> 18:20.480
I'm sorry, weren't you the one
who asked for a reset? Fine.

18:20.480 --> 18:24.120
Are you now asking her if she hired
somebody to kill Hannah,

18:24.120 --> 18:26.960
but also went along to...

18:26.960 --> 18:29.600
Well, you tell me
because I'm a bit confused here.

18:29.600 --> 18:32.080
I didn't ask somebody to strangle
Hannah with my scarf.

18:32.080 --> 18:35.680
That's just mental. Did you strangle
her with it? No. Where is it?

18:35.680 --> 18:39.240
What have you done with it?
It must have fallen off
or somebody nicked it.

18:39.240 --> 18:42.720
I honestly haven't got a clue! OK.

18:44.960 --> 18:47.920
My client has answered your
questions to the best

18:47.920 --> 18:51.600
of her ability. Your original
hypothesis is obviously in tatters

18:51.600 --> 18:54.000
and now you're just flailing about.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.080
Either charge her - which I highly
doubt the CPS will consider

18:57.080 --> 19:00.920
for a moment - or let her go.

19:06.560 --> 19:09.000
We'll take a break.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.080
Interview terminated 10:40am.

19:41.080 --> 19:44.480
We've picked up Troy's car on ANPR
at 4:13am,

19:44.480 --> 19:47.520
ten miles away from Hannah's.
Well, that's no good for us.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.920
It doesn't mean he was driving it.

19:49.920 --> 19:53.280
At 4:25am a neighbour of Troy
was disturbed by music

19:53.280 --> 19:55.640
playing loudly from the car
outside his house.

19:55.640 --> 19:57.520
He took footage of it on his phone.

19:57.520 --> 20:00.560
Troy gets out of his car,
gives the neighbour the finger

20:00.560 --> 20:02.600
and goes into his house.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.800
The problem is...
I know what the problem is.

20:06.800 --> 20:09.240
No Troy, no Talitha.

20:11.520 --> 20:13.000
Fuck it.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.080
Fuck it!

20:17.080 --> 20:20.200
Tell the custody sergeant. Aren't
you going to check with James?

20:20.200 --> 20:21.800
Why give him the satisfaction?

20:21.800 --> 20:25.200
We haven't got the scarf
and Troy's in the clear.

20:25.200 --> 20:28.280
I know exactly what Ginny Hoult'll
say and so do you.

20:31.600 --> 20:36.040
I'll call them and let them know and
we can...brief them properly later.

20:37.720 --> 20:39.040
Bollocks.

21:08.600 --> 21:13.160
She's out, but it's not over yet.
They just haven't got enough.

21:22.200 --> 21:23.520
Thank you.

21:25.120 --> 21:29.160
She's watching you. They've timed
this to see how you'll react.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.120
Troy Manners.

21:34.120 --> 21:36.360
Well, fancy meeting you here.

21:38.480 --> 21:40.320
It's Lady Tease.

21:40.320 --> 21:43.040
Hey, any time
you need to see me, angel.

21:44.320 --> 21:46.440
And my favourite solicitor.

21:46.440 --> 21:49.520
I'm sorry I never got to require
your services again.

21:49.520 --> 21:53.360
There's always the next time.
And the time after that.

21:53.360 --> 21:56.960
Have to come up with something
better than this effort.

21:56.960 --> 21:59.840
Rubbish, even by your standards.

21:59.840 --> 22:02.160
No comment.

22:02.160 --> 22:03.360
Come on.

22:10.240 --> 22:12.640
I can leave the country?

22:12.640 --> 22:16.400
You can, although you need to let
them know. Oh, you tell them, baby.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.680
Tell them I'm off to gay Paris.

22:18.680 --> 22:21.040
I'm just glad it's all over!

22:21.040 --> 22:22.800
Calm down, Talitha.

22:22.800 --> 22:25.960
And I get to visit my favourite
city. Get in the car.

22:25.960 --> 22:29.440
I'll take you to my office.
We'll make a plan.

22:29.440 --> 22:32.320
Uh, why can't I just go home?

22:32.320 --> 22:35.080
Because you're all over social
media, so the press will almost

22:35.080 --> 22:38.520
certainly be waiting for you.
I'll take you to my office,

22:38.520 --> 22:42.080
we'll sort out
getting your stuff back. In.

22:44.600 --> 22:50.680
♪ Champs-Elysees, Champs-Elysees,
Champs-Elysees, need to hurry. ♪

22:50.680 --> 22:52.760
What are you...?

22:52.760 --> 22:55.840
Talitha. Talitha.

22:55.840 --> 22:58.040
Hey, hey. I'm fine.

23:23.560 --> 23:26.240
Um... I'm fine.

23:26.240 --> 23:30.040
I faint sometimes.
I've got low iron.

23:33.760 --> 23:35.600
Take a minute or two.

23:44.120 --> 23:46.040
Hey. Hey, Heidi.

23:51.520 --> 23:52.680
Thanks.

23:57.960 --> 24:00.080
Your dad's at the office.

24:04.160 --> 24:06.440
Why?

24:06.440 --> 24:08.520
I don't know.

24:08.520 --> 24:10.880
I'll just go home,
I'll take my chances.

24:10.880 --> 24:13.520
He could help you.
He said he wants to. No.

24:25.480 --> 24:27.920
I never do this....

24:29.320 --> 24:32.640
..but you need to get some food
and a serious time-out.

24:37.440 --> 24:39.120
Where are we going?

24:44.480 --> 24:47.480
Police have confirmed
that two unnamed individuals

24:47.480 --> 24:49.880
who were arrested
in the Hannah Ellis case

24:49.880 --> 24:53.000
have both been released
under investigation.

24:53.000 --> 24:57.240
They have described their inquiries
as complex and fast moving

24:57.240 --> 25:01.480
and once again have urged people
not to speculate on social media.

25:01.480 --> 25:03.920
You did the only possible thing.

25:03.920 --> 25:07.560
There simply wasn't enough to charge
her and we would have told you that.

25:07.560 --> 25:11.200
There's still loads that doesn't
sit right with me. Agreed.

25:11.200 --> 25:15.480
But, sadly, things not sitting right
with you doesn't get us even close

25:15.480 --> 25:18.800
to the threshold.
So what's next?

25:18.800 --> 25:21.280
We're going to London
to talk to Dillon Harwood.

25:21.280 --> 25:24.080
And you're going on the basis that
Talitha does now require an alibi?

25:24.080 --> 25:26.960
He knew both girls and he's always
been of interest to us, so...

25:26.960 --> 25:30.800
Tread carefully, though. The mother
is powerful. Yeah, we just...

25:30.800 --> 25:33.200
We just want to know if he
contradicts her version

25:33.200 --> 25:37.160
of events at any point. I would say
the person of most interest

25:37.160 --> 25:41.040
is whoever was in Hannah's room
drinking vodka with her that night.

25:41.040 --> 25:44.360
What if it's Dillon? It's only way
to make the scarf make any sense.

25:44.360 --> 25:46.440
We'll soon find out.

25:46.440 --> 25:50.960
Has Hannah's mother been informed
about Talitha's release?

25:50.960 --> 25:56.480
Yes, and she...did not take it well.
The FLO was with her.

25:58.160 --> 26:00.800
I think I'll go and have
a quick chat with her just to...

26:00.800 --> 26:03.880
..explain what it all means.
Yeah, make yourself useful.

26:05.640 --> 26:07.400
Sorry, what did you say?

26:08.640 --> 26:12.360
Lighten up, mate. Just kidding.
Oh, I'm not your mate.

26:12.360 --> 26:14.760
But I am the first person
you're going to have to convince

26:14.760 --> 26:16.920
if you want to approve any charges
in this case.

26:26.360 --> 26:28.920
Let us know what happens
with Dillon Harwood.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Did she do it, though?

26:47.680 --> 26:50.480
I was on the jury I would think
that there wasn't enough evidence.

26:50.480 --> 26:53.160
I don't care about fucking juries.

26:58.680 --> 27:01.080
I bought a sleeping bag for her.

27:02.560 --> 27:04.160
For her birthday.

27:05.560 --> 27:07.800
She like going to festivals.

27:10.760 --> 27:12.400
I will never sleep again

27:12.400 --> 27:15.120
until the person who killed her
is behind bars.

27:19.120 --> 27:22.640
Andrea, I...
absolutely promise you,

27:22.640 --> 27:26.000
I will do everything that I can
to make that happen.

27:34.520 --> 27:39.920
Go on, Mac. Toxicology found a small
amount of GHB in Hannah's system.

27:39.920 --> 27:43.560
They've also got a DNA sample
from the vaginal swab.

27:43.560 --> 27:49.000
It's not Troy Manners and it's not
matched to anybody on the database.

27:50.480 --> 27:54.600
But it is the same as the sample
from the neck of the vodka bottle.

27:54.600 --> 27:56.120
Hannah had sex that night

27:56.120 --> 27:59.480
with whoever was drinking from
that bottle. Check Talitha's room,

27:59.480 --> 28:03.320
see if we can get another match
on Mystery Man's DNA.

28:03.320 --> 28:06.840
If Talitha knows Vodka Drinker,
we're still in business.

28:06.840 --> 28:08.840
OK, will do, boss.

28:08.840 --> 28:11.720
Oh, and the dress and jacket
were at the dry cleaners.

28:11.720 --> 28:14.320
Annoyingly,
they had already been cleaned,

28:14.320 --> 28:18.080
but we've sent them to forensics
anyway. Right, well, thanks, Mac.

28:20.480 --> 28:23.680
Why would the killer
leave the bottle?

28:23.680 --> 28:26.800
Priority was to dispose of the body
and they just forgot.

28:26.800 --> 28:29.480
Or they got spooked.
Oh, excellent! What's happened?

28:29.480 --> 28:33.000
We got the Mini Lop. What?
It's like a tiny rabbit.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.600
Amy's been after us to get her one
for a birthday. Fuck's sake, Andy.

28:36.600 --> 28:39.480
Thought it was good news about
something that actually mattered.

28:39.480 --> 28:42.720
It is. Look. Look how cute that is.

28:42.720 --> 28:45.040
You're soft as shite
when it comes to that kid.

28:45.040 --> 28:47.520
You know, she got a
Millionaire Reader Award last week.

28:47.520 --> 28:49.840
Mother's brains, then.

29:03.040 --> 29:05.120
Mm.

29:05.120 --> 29:06.680
This is really good.

29:07.800 --> 29:10.840
I don't normally eat processed
multinational shit.

29:10.840 --> 29:13.000
Processed multinational shit is OK.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.600
It has to pass stringent
safety regulations,

29:15.600 --> 29:18.480
unlike the home-made organic shit.

29:19.560 --> 29:21.160
Is this your kid?

29:22.320 --> 29:25.000
That's my brother and my niece, Kim.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
I thought he might be your ex.
Nope. Put it down, please.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.240
Your fingers are all greasy.

29:32.040 --> 29:34.560
I'll show you where Kim normally
sleeps when she stays.

29:34.560 --> 29:38.320
Are you're good auntie?
I bet you are.

29:38.320 --> 29:41.600
No idea.
But I love my niece, though,

29:41.600 --> 29:45.480
and I hope the feeling is mutual.
Kim's a good name.

29:45.480 --> 29:48.480
I thought they were all called
Shineese or Tikanya these days.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.040
They? Or is it Kim with
an apostrophe in the middle?

29:57.760 --> 30:02.080
You're tired. I'll make
an exception for you this time.

30:03.680 --> 30:05.520
I'm only kidding. Come on.

30:20.800 --> 30:24.040
In there. Nice!

30:27.840 --> 30:31.520
Get some rest. See you later.

30:31.520 --> 30:34.320
Cleo. I just want to say...

30:38.720 --> 30:43.000
It's fine, don't... Get my passport
from my house, would you?

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
You're quite funny sometimes.
Thanks. Fooled you.

30:57.640 --> 31:00.520
So, Talitha and Hannah
we're good friends once?

31:00.520 --> 31:03.760
I don't know about good but, yeah,
they hung out.

31:03.760 --> 31:06.520
Didn't you go to Green Man
last year with them, Alice?

31:06.520 --> 31:09.040
But then they had a falling out.
What about?

31:09.040 --> 31:12.600
Hannah never said. We thought
it was to do with Dillon.

31:12.600 --> 31:15.640
Dillon? Harwood.
His mum's a politician

31:15.640 --> 31:19.560
and his dad's Paul Harwood.
Historian.

31:19.560 --> 31:23.560
Right. So there was maybe
some jealousy between...

31:23.560 --> 31:27.640
Hannah had a bit of a thing
about Oxford rejects.

31:27.640 --> 31:30.960
Yeah, cos, well, didn't she get in
but turn it down? Mm.

31:30.960 --> 31:33.000
Exactly that. Anyway,

31:33.000 --> 31:37.520
Talitha had her sex work
and webcams... Lady Tease.

31:37.520 --> 31:41.280
That's what she called herself.
I mean, I'm not being judgmental.

31:41.280 --> 31:44.480
Sex work is just a job.
Not much like mine, unfortunately.

31:44.480 --> 31:46.560
But, yeah, I see what you mean.

31:46.560 --> 31:49.080
What paper did you say
you worked for? I didn't.

31:49.080 --> 31:51.920
I'm sort of, you know, freelance.

31:51.920 --> 31:55.600
So tell me a bit more about
this Dillon character.

31:55.600 --> 31:58.520
Well, him and Talitha
lived together. But not...

31:58.520 --> 32:00.000
Nobody really knew,

32:00.000 --> 32:03.680
but they came across more like
best mates, to be honest.

32:10.960 --> 32:13.360
Sorry, I'm just leaving.

32:13.360 --> 32:17.240
We're aware you must be very busy,
Mrs Harwood. Speaking at a meeting.

32:17.240 --> 32:20.840
It's the anniversary of the start
of the Grunwick strike.

32:20.840 --> 32:24.360
Important, is it? 1970s?

32:24.360 --> 32:26.000
A group of South Asian women

32:26.000 --> 32:28.400
fighting for trade union
recognition.

32:28.400 --> 32:31.840
There was a lot of police violence
from the Special Patrol Group.

32:31.840 --> 32:33.080
Same bunch of thugs

32:33.080 --> 32:36.000
who killed Blair Peach
for fighting Nazis in Southall.

32:36.000 --> 32:39.720
My grandad died fighting
the Nazis in France.

32:39.720 --> 32:43.120
We don't want to hold you up,
we were just wondering
if we could speak to Dylan.

32:43.120 --> 32:46.520
He's gone to the cottage
in the New Forest. On his own?

32:46.520 --> 32:49.560
He sometimes goes down there
to study.

32:49.560 --> 32:52.080
I'm assuming this is about
Talitha Campbell.

32:52.080 --> 32:55.600
We'd like to ask him a few questions
about the night of the ball.

32:55.600 --> 32:57.960
You don't think he has anything
to do with the girl's death?

32:57.960 --> 33:00.880
No, but he did walk
Talitha home that night.

33:00.880 --> 33:03.480
We just want to ask him
a couple of questions about it.

33:03.480 --> 33:05.760
Did she have anything to do with it?

33:05.760 --> 33:08.440
It's a very preliminary stage
of the investigation.

33:08.440 --> 33:10.320
We're keeping an open mind.

33:10.320 --> 33:11.760
Well.

33:11.760 --> 33:14.160
I suppose that's progress, of sorts.

33:14.160 --> 33:16.960
Could we have the address
of the cottage, please?

33:23.880 --> 33:26.040
Patronising cow.

33:26.040 --> 33:30.400
Your grandad died in France?
Could have done.

33:30.400 --> 33:33.040
Give us a history lessons,
a massive house,

33:33.040 --> 33:35.760
send their kids to private school,
country college?

34:30.800 --> 34:32.200
Go on, Mac.

34:32.200 --> 34:36.720
Mystery Man's DNA has been found
in Talitha's room. Fucking get in!

34:36.720 --> 34:40.240
I knew it! Let's see what
Ginny Hoult has to say about that,

34:40.240 --> 34:41.960
you spineless pricks.

34:41.960 --> 34:44.640
There was quite a lot of material,
so not just a one-off.

34:44.640 --> 34:48.400
We found a hair on a chair. You know
what I'm thinking now, don't you?

34:48.400 --> 34:50.240
James might be right.

34:50.240 --> 34:53.400
Talitha and Hannah drink from the
glasses that the mum cleaned

34:53.400 --> 34:57.080
and then Mystery Man swigging
from the vodka... Watch out!

34:57.080 --> 34:58.480
Fuck me!

35:00.120 --> 35:03.000
What are all those little 'orses
doing in the middle of the road?

35:04.320 --> 35:07.920
It's donkeys.
It's a thing down here, I think.

35:07.920 --> 35:11.360
I'm just going to get a...
get a picture for Amy.

35:12.800 --> 35:14.880
This place is weird.

35:16.840 --> 35:19.080
What you laughing at? Come on.

35:19.080 --> 35:21.720
Out the road. Off you trot.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.520
Bloody hell.

35:25.760 --> 35:27.240
Honestly.

36:06.960 --> 36:10.800
Can I help you?
Are you Dillon Harwood? Yeah.

36:10.800 --> 36:14.520
Hiya, Dillon. I'm DI Cassidy from
South West Police. No need to worry.

36:14.520 --> 36:18.560
This isn't anything about you
specifically. We're just talking
to everyone who knew Hannah Ellis,

36:18.560 --> 36:21.120
and was at the ball the night
she was killed. Of course.

36:23.080 --> 36:25.000
Can we come in, please?

36:25.000 --> 36:27.960
Yeah, sure. No problem.

36:30.240 --> 36:31.640
Thank you.

36:37.040 --> 36:39.280
Blimey, it's warm in here.

36:42.720 --> 36:47.720
But funny. To light a fire
on a warm day like today.

36:47.720 --> 36:51.760
It's as much about the aesthetic
is about the warmth. Mm.

36:55.960 --> 36:57.880
Uh, what are you doing?

37:03.880 --> 37:07.360
Would you be prepared to give us
a DNA sample, Dillon?

37:07.360 --> 37:09.880
Just for elimination purposes.

38:03.520 --> 38:08.320
There's these donkeys
on the road, right?

38:08.320 --> 38:13.240
But she don't see she's in
the swing of her little theory.

38:13.240 --> 38:16.880
So I have to go, "Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, stop the car, stop the car."

38:16.880 --> 38:18.280
That's it, yeah.

38:18.280 --> 38:22.640
She slammed the brakes on, right?
Her face has dropped and she says,

38:22.640 --> 38:25.960
"Here, what are all these little
horses doing in the road?"

38:28.000 --> 38:30.280
I know, I know, I know.

38:33.080 --> 38:35.480
So Dillon Harwood is on his way
back here for questioning

38:35.480 --> 38:39.960
and a DNA sample. Don't worry,
it's already all over social media.

38:39.960 --> 38:42.480
They haven't named which Shadow
Cabinet Minister's son,

38:42.480 --> 38:44.120
but it's only a matter of time.

38:44.120 --> 38:46.840
Jesus. That station leaks
like a bloody sieve.

38:46.840 --> 38:49.040
So, the big question is...

38:49.040 --> 38:51.880
Is Dillon the guy
swigging from the bottle of vodka

38:51.880 --> 38:54.000
who also had sex
with Hannah that night?

38:54.000 --> 38:57.200
He'd have a lot of questions
to answer. He would.

38:57.200 --> 38:59.520
What does that mean
for Talitha Campbell?

38:59.520 --> 39:02.960
Her DNA can't be found anywhere
that the defence won't argue

39:02.960 --> 39:05.720
could have been transmitted
prior to the night of the murder.

39:05.720 --> 39:08.880
As in, Talitha had been
To Hannah's house before. Yeah.

39:08.880 --> 39:12.040
But Cassidy is not going to
drop her in a hurry, so...

39:12.040 --> 39:14.120
..she's not off the hook yet.
All right.

39:17.720 --> 39:21.200
The police are remaining
tight-lipped about a third arrest

39:21.200 --> 39:23.960
in the case of murdered student
Hannah Ellis,

39:23.960 --> 39:27.920
following the earlier release
of their two initial suspects.

39:27.920 --> 39:31.040
The man in his 20s
was arrested earlier today,

39:31.040 --> 39:32.960
but South West Police...

39:32.960 --> 39:36.240
..have declined to provide
any further information.

39:39.800 --> 39:43.040
Have you heard about Dillon?

39:43.040 --> 39:46.560
Yes. We have to discuss
that previous issue.

39:47.960 --> 39:51.000
OK. What's happened?

39:51.000 --> 39:53.480
All I know is that the police
have taken a DNA test,

39:53.480 --> 39:57.040
and they're now questioning him.
I can't get hold of him.

39:57.040 --> 40:01.200
So...?
I can't discuss it on the phone.

40:01.200 --> 40:04.160
Once I work out a way to get past
the press camped outside,

40:04.160 --> 40:06.080
I'm heading down there
to see Dillon.

40:06.080 --> 40:08.080
I'll come to see you on my way.

40:08.080 --> 40:10.280
Look, I really don't think
that's necessary.

40:10.280 --> 40:12.760
They could make a lot out of this,
Stephen.

40:12.760 --> 40:15.920
So I want to make sure we're singing
from the same hymn sheet.

40:17.600 --> 40:19.960
I'll call you
when I come off the M4.

40:43.360 --> 40:44.920
Hi, Mr Campbell.

40:46.320 --> 40:47.920
Yeah, she's here.

40:49.480 --> 40:51.560
She's asleep at the moment.

40:53.120 --> 40:55.000
I'd rather not do that.

40:55.000 --> 40:58.520
She's had a pretty exhausting time
the last 48 hours.

41:04.400 --> 41:06.360
I'll see you in 15 minutes.

41:15.600 --> 41:18.640
"Every time a high street business
survives,

41:18.640 --> 41:20.880
"a fairy does a little dance."

41:22.680 --> 41:24.560
I saw that in some cafe in town.

41:24.560 --> 41:28.040
It had inspirational messages
all over it. Nauseating.

41:28.040 --> 41:32.080
Drives me nuts. I want a coffee,
not a life lesson.

41:32.080 --> 41:35.840
Well, the cakes are good, so...
Yeah.

41:35.840 --> 41:36.960
So.

41:38.360 --> 41:41.440
She's been released?
Under investigation.

41:43.120 --> 41:47.000
Things haven't been good
between us for a long time.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.040
I have sensed some tension.

41:49.040 --> 41:52.440
She likes you. How do you...?

41:52.440 --> 41:55.040
It's been 48 hours
and you haven't strangled her.

41:55.040 --> 41:58.600
And she's sleeping at you flat.
Can't believe you did that.

41:58.600 --> 42:02.640
She had just fainted and was clearly
in a very vulnerable condition.

42:02.640 --> 42:04.120
I appreciate it.

42:07.480 --> 42:11.960
She wants to work with you,
that can work any number of ways -

42:11.960 --> 42:15.040
the legal aid way or my way,

42:15.040 --> 42:18.240
which involves the use of my PI
and a premier league barrister.

42:19.760 --> 42:23.840
In exchange for which...? Why do you
assume there is a quid pro quo?

42:23.840 --> 42:28.480
I'm sure Cleo will do everything
possible to facilitate communication

42:28.480 --> 42:32.760
between you and your daughter,
Mr Campbell. I won't lie to her.

42:32.760 --> 42:37.680
What do you mean? I mean, I will
tell her that that is the offer.

42:37.680 --> 42:41.960
We join forces,
which is obviously attractive to us,

42:41.960 --> 42:44.480
in exchange for her talking to you.

42:47.960 --> 42:50.800
I don't see a massive problem
with that.

42:59.080 --> 43:02.640
I thought you'd screwed
that up then. I will tell her.

43:02.640 --> 43:05.160
Sure. But tell her in a way
that doesn't, you know...

43:05.160 --> 43:08.520
I'm comfortable with it, Heidi. OK,
but last time you got uncomfortable,

43:08.520 --> 43:10.640
you became unemployed
for a fair old time.

43:10.640 --> 43:13.400
so do the math, as they say.
Thanks for that.

43:13.400 --> 43:16.120
Well, you're not the only one
who feels the imperatives of honesty

43:16.120 --> 43:17.560
from time to time.

43:21.360 --> 43:25.080
Anything from the fire yet?
Looks like an item of clothing.

43:25.080 --> 43:27.440
And who makes a fire
with an item of clothing? Exactly.

43:27.440 --> 43:29.560
They're testing it.

43:30.920 --> 43:33.000
Hang on. What?

43:33.000 --> 43:34.640
DNA test is in.

43:34.640 --> 43:36.200
Go on.

43:36.200 --> 43:40.720
Dillon Harwood is Vodka Drinker.

43:40.720 --> 43:43.840
Which means he's the one who had sex
with Hannah on the night
she was murdered

43:43.840 --> 43:48.040
because the semen trace matches.
Yeah. That's quite a development.

43:53.880 --> 43:56.280
Shall I call you Sundance?

43:56.280 --> 43:57.760
No, I'm Andy.

43:57.760 --> 44:00.760
People only call me that because
the boss's nickname is Butch...

44:00.760 --> 44:03.040
Cos her surname is Cassidy.

44:03.040 --> 44:06.120
And she's got more balls
than most of your department.

44:07.960 --> 44:11.440
Let's keep it brief, cos I
shouldn't be meeting in person.

44:11.440 --> 44:13.040
They got forensics onto it now

44:13.040 --> 44:15.680
so it's a matter of time
before they charge him.

44:15.680 --> 44:18.360
What's it all mean for Talitha?

44:18.360 --> 44:21.720
She's got a really shit attitude...
Tell me something I don't know.

44:21.720 --> 44:25.000
She needs to watch that.
Cos if she's pissing my DI off

44:25.000 --> 44:27.200
then she's going to piss a jury off
even more.

44:27.200 --> 44:28.880
Why should there even be a jury?

44:28.880 --> 44:31.760
Cassidy still thinks she's involved,
somehow. All she's doing

44:31.760 --> 44:34.240
is looking for a new version
that suits her original hunch.

44:34.240 --> 44:36.920
Cops and their hunches, eh?

44:36.920 --> 44:40.080
Never sent anyone done down
I didn't know was guilty.

44:40.080 --> 44:43.440
Tell that to the Court of Appeal.

44:43.440 --> 44:46.880
I've got a couple of names
I need to run past you.

44:46.880 --> 44:50.320
You come across a girl
called Lucinda Bright
in your investigations yet?

45:55.440 --> 45:58.760
Right, Dillon, you've waived
your right to legal representation,

45:58.760 --> 46:02.920
but you can change your mind
about that at any time,
do you understand? Yeah.

46:02.920 --> 46:05.000
OK. Erm...

46:05.000 --> 46:08.800
Can I ask a very direct
and rather personal question?

46:08.800 --> 46:10.440
Please do.

46:10.440 --> 46:14.040
Have you ever had sex
with Hannah Ellis? Yes.

46:14.040 --> 46:18.560
And when was the last time that
happened? On the night of the ball.

46:18.560 --> 46:21.120
The night of the ball? Yeah.

46:21.120 --> 46:25.720
Before or after she went to work
a shift serving drinks?

46:25.720 --> 46:28.160
Er...before.

46:30.440 --> 46:31.920
Uh...

46:33.000 --> 46:35.280
We had some drinks. We...

46:36.960 --> 46:39.920
Uh...you know, um...

46:39.920 --> 46:42.680
And then Hannah went to work
and I went to the ball.

46:42.680 --> 46:45.440
And you didn't see her after that?

46:45.440 --> 46:49.040
No. Well, maybe in passing
at the ball. She was...

46:49.040 --> 46:52.920
She was she was handing out
Negronis and I was, you know...

46:52.920 --> 46:54.920
You know what it's like.

46:54.920 --> 46:56.720
And you didn't think to mention it

46:56.720 --> 47:00.840
at any point after her
disappearance? No.

47:00.840 --> 47:02.320
Why not?

47:02.320 --> 47:05.400
I mean, we were making appeals.
You know what, Detective?

47:05.400 --> 47:06.880
I think I was...

47:08.480 --> 47:11.280
I was so shocked
I went into a kind of...

47:12.440 --> 47:16.320
..fugue state. A fugue state?

47:16.320 --> 47:19.680
You know, I...
I just went into shock.

47:19.680 --> 47:23.120
OK, so in your fugue state...
I know it sounds weird, but, just,

47:23.120 --> 47:25.920
if you talk to my mother,
she'll tell you all about it.

47:25.920 --> 47:27.240
All about what?

47:28.720 --> 47:32.520
Well, they've never really been
able to pin it down, but, um,

47:32.520 --> 47:35.000
it's basically caused by anxiety.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.120
I don't think it got spotted
for a long time

47:37.120 --> 47:40.040
because I'm a very high achiever,
educationally.

47:41.960 --> 47:44.920
OK, well, let's...
Let's run with it for now.

47:44.920 --> 47:48.600
So in your fugue state,
you head to the family cottage

47:48.600 --> 47:51.400
in the New Forest. Yeah.
It's lovely down there.

47:51.400 --> 47:54.680
Especially on a beautiful, warm day.

47:54.680 --> 47:56.480
I did say this at the time.

47:58.560 --> 48:01.400
Most people use wood on a fire.

48:02.480 --> 48:04.120
We found fabrics.

48:05.680 --> 48:09.760
It's just a few bits and bobs,
some old clothes I was sick of.

48:12.920 --> 48:17.680
You and Talitha Campbell
are very good friends. Yes.

48:17.680 --> 48:22.560
Talitha and Hannah had a falling
out. Do you know what about?

48:22.560 --> 48:25.120
Uh, sort of. Yeah.

48:25.120 --> 48:28.320
In what way "sort of, yeah"?

48:28.320 --> 48:30.640
You know how it is
with friends at uni.

48:30.640 --> 48:34.320
Be more specific.
Somebody says something,

48:34.320 --> 48:36.400
somebody else gets the wrong end
of the stick,

48:36.400 --> 48:38.560
they get involved and it all...

48:40.520 --> 48:42.520
..kicks off.

48:42.520 --> 48:44.720
As an educational high achiever,

48:44.720 --> 48:48.240
I think you can do
a little better than this.

48:48.240 --> 48:53.520
I'm not your head of a year
asking about misbehaviour in class.

48:53.520 --> 48:57.600
A young woman is lying dead
in the morgue.

48:57.600 --> 49:00.080
I didn't kill Hannah.

49:00.080 --> 49:04.360
That's the truth. The whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

49:08.080 --> 49:11.720
Suspend it there.
I need to take this.

49:11.720 --> 49:15.040
Interview suspended at 20:36.

49:56.320 --> 49:57.760
Morning.

50:00.360 --> 50:03.320
Your dad
was at the office yesterday.

50:03.320 --> 50:06.160
He's offered to help us financially
with everything we need.

50:06.160 --> 50:08.520
We don't need anything.
They've released me.

50:08.520 --> 50:10.880
OK, but you're still under
investigation.

50:10.880 --> 50:15.400
They could re-arrest if new evidence
comes to light. It won't.

50:16.840 --> 50:20.280
Anyway, I said I would
ask you to speak with him.

50:20.280 --> 50:24.000
Him helping you financially
is conditional

50:24.000 --> 50:27.680
on me speaking with him? Yes.

50:27.680 --> 50:29.480
No way.

50:31.320 --> 50:33.080
I'm sorry, Cleo.

50:34.840 --> 50:38.360
It's just you and me. OK,
but there's no absolute guarantee

50:38.360 --> 50:41.520
that I'll be appointed
even with legal aid...

50:46.080 --> 50:50.440
The police have arrested
Dillon Harwood. Dillon?

50:53.960 --> 50:55.960
Oh.

50:55.960 --> 50:59.640
And if they've arrested him,
it means they have something on him.

51:02.600 --> 51:04.600
Well, that means
I'm in the clear, right?

51:04.600 --> 51:07.560
I'll see what I can find out.

51:07.560 --> 51:09.520
Stay here for now.

51:09.520 --> 51:11.520
Can I use your phone?

51:11.520 --> 51:16.080
Just hold your horses
till we know what's happening.

52:16.960 --> 52:20.960
So this previous case against
Dillon... There is no issue here.

52:20.960 --> 52:24.840
Our panel dismissed it
on entirely legitimate grounds.

52:24.840 --> 52:27.560
Can they use it in court?
I don't know. I'm not a lawyer.

52:27.560 --> 52:29.840
Well, the press
will get hold of it eventually.

52:29.840 --> 52:31.520
As well as our personal connections,

52:31.520 --> 52:34.520
Paul and I were colleagues.
That's hardly newsworthy.

52:34.520 --> 52:37.800
And you've come to dinner
a few times.

52:37.800 --> 52:41.240
I don't think
that's your main concern here.

52:41.240 --> 52:44.760
Oh? What's my main concern, then?

52:46.720 --> 52:49.400
Talitha knows something else. What?

52:51.320 --> 52:55.840
Hannah Ellis was also considering
a complaint against Dillon.

52:55.840 --> 52:59.240
For what?
I never got to find out properly.

52:59.240 --> 53:02.680
Uh...filming her.

53:02.680 --> 53:05.840
Unwanted gifts,
turning up unexpectedly.

53:05.840 --> 53:09.560
Dillon's highly strung.
Needy. Always has been.

53:11.720 --> 53:14.320
Wait. How did Talitha know this?

53:16.440 --> 53:18.480
And how do you know she knows?

53:22.640 --> 53:24.120
Oh, Stephen.

53:26.120 --> 53:28.360
Up to your old tricks again.

53:31.120 --> 53:33.560
That girl is bad news.

53:42.000 --> 53:46.480
We've got him. Microscopic DNA
fragment from Dillon

53:46.480 --> 53:50.960
on the zipper of the sleeping bag.
He put her in there. We got him!

53:50.960 --> 53:53.800
Let's see if he wants a lawyer now.

54:03.960 --> 54:05.440
It's over, Dillon.

54:07.520 --> 54:09.240
We know it was you.

54:10.880 --> 54:14.120
You've got all the forensic evidence
we need.

54:16.360 --> 54:20.600
Do you want to make it easier
now...on you?

54:22.040 --> 54:24.080
And on Hannah's mum?

54:38.480 --> 54:39.840
I would.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.120
I'll tell you what happened.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.120
It was an accident.

55:01.280 --> 55:03.440
We didn't go there

55:03.440 --> 55:06.200
with any intention
of hurting Hannah.

55:07.360 --> 55:08.840
"We"?

55:12.080 --> 55:14.880
Who's we, Dillon?

55:52.040 --> 55:53.480
Talitha.

56:02.120 --> 56:04.400
I'm just going to go
lie down for a bit.

56:35.240 --> 56:37.080
What happens now?
