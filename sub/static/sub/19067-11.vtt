01:07.609 --> 01:09.736
[Allura] All right then,
what's the next one?

01:09.820 --> 01:12.072
[squeaking]

01:12.155 --> 01:14.449
- Two words.
- [squeaking]

01:14.533 --> 01:15.409
Second word.

01:17.536 --> 01:18.579
Waves?

01:19.538 --> 01:20.747
So I'm close.

01:20.831 --> 01:24.626
Ocean? Splash? Drink? Water?

01:24.710 --> 01:26.253
[squeaking]

01:26.336 --> 01:28.005
Water!

01:28.088 --> 01:30.048
All right then. First word.

01:34.177 --> 01:35.512
[growling]

01:35.595 --> 01:36.972
[Allura] That's a Bytor!

01:37.055 --> 01:38.724
Bytor water!

01:39.683 --> 01:43.020
- [laughs] Yes!
- [joyful squeaking]

01:43.103 --> 01:44.229
Hunk was right.

01:44.313 --> 01:47.024
These Earth road trip games
do help pass the time.

01:48.191 --> 01:49.109
[beeping]

01:49.192 --> 01:52.029
<i>How are you, Princess?</i>
<i>Are you almost at the Balmera?</i>

01:52.112 --> 01:55.073
I'm scheduled to arrive
in just a few doboshes.

01:55.157 --> 01:57.868
I hope I'm able to find a crystal
big enough for the teludav.

01:57.951 --> 02:00.037
Have you heard from the other Paladins?

02:00.120 --> 02:02.998
<i>I had contact with Lance,</i>
<i>Shiro and Pidge a little bit ago.</i>

02:03.081 --> 02:04.625
<i>They've located Slav.</i>

02:04.708 --> 02:09.003
- What about Hunk and-- and Keith?
<i>- No word from them yet.</i>

02:09.086 --> 02:12.132
I have no doubt my scientifically
accurate instructional video

02:12.215 --> 02:13.425
was of great help.

02:13.508 --> 02:15.636
I'm sure it was.

02:15.719 --> 02:18.055
If they collect enough scaultrite
for the lenses,

02:18.138 --> 02:19.931
will your teludav structure be complete?

02:20.641 --> 02:21.975
It's nearly done.

02:22.059 --> 02:24.770
The Olkari and I
have been working on it day and night.

02:24.853 --> 02:26.438
It will be ready in time.

02:26.521 --> 02:28.815
[sighs] Oh, I hope so.

02:28.899 --> 02:32.194
[Coran] <i>What's going on, Princess?</i>
<i>You sound worried.</i>

02:32.277 --> 02:34.655
I was thinking of my father.

02:34.738 --> 02:37.449
He gave his life to try to keep Voltron
out of Zarkon's hands

02:37.532 --> 02:40.369
and now we have a chance to defeat him.

02:40.452 --> 02:43.246
I... I don't want to fail.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.165
[Coran] <i>You know...</i>

02:45.248 --> 02:49.044
Princess,
your father would be proud of you.

02:49.127 --> 02:52.089
It wasn't that long ago we found out
Altea had been destroyed.

02:53.131 --> 02:56.843
- I've never felt so alone.
<i>- Nor have I.</i>

02:56.927 --> 02:59.679
<i>And we could have easily given up.</i>
<i>But we didn't.</i>

02:59.763 --> 03:02.140
<i>You didn't. And now look at us.</i>

03:02.224 --> 03:03.850
<i>We reformed Voltron.</i>

03:03.934 --> 03:07.938
<i>We freed the Olkari and the Balmerans,</i>
<i>and now they're working alongside us.</i>

03:08.605 --> 03:11.483
You're right, Coran. We have allies.

03:11.566 --> 03:13.527
And that's what's going to defeat Zarkon.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.946
<i>Crack a squizzle on the Balmera, Princess.</i>

03:16.029 --> 03:17.489
Thank you, Coran.

03:26.123 --> 03:28.166
- [rumbling]
- [gasps]

03:44.725 --> 03:47.269
[jets decelerating]

03:56.945 --> 04:01.742
The Balmera welcomes your return,
Princess Allura.

04:01.825 --> 04:03.952
Princess, did Hunk accompany you?

04:04.035 --> 04:06.538
I'm sorry, Shay, but I've come alone.

04:06.621 --> 04:08.039
The others are on missions of their own,

04:08.123 --> 04:10.459
collecting important elements
that we need to defeat Zarkon.

04:11.418 --> 04:14.421
Defeat Zarkon? How can we help?

04:14.504 --> 04:18.048
The Balmera and its people
can never thank you enough

04:18.132 --> 04:19.968
for all that you've done.

04:20.051 --> 04:24.055
If the Balmera will give it,
I need a crystal.

04:24.139 --> 04:25.640
[Shay] Battleship class?

04:26.349 --> 04:27.309
Bigger.

04:45.160 --> 04:48.246
- [Druid] Haggar.
- What is it?

04:48.330 --> 04:52.459
We found further evidence
of the spy within our fleet.

04:52.542 --> 04:57.881
This encrypted chip was in the outbound
quantum entanglement chain.

04:57.964 --> 05:02.719
Put the chip back,
and wait to see who retrieves it.

05:11.353 --> 05:12.979
[Allura] Incredible.

05:13.063 --> 05:16.650
When the Galra were here,
these caverns were closed off.

05:16.733 --> 05:19.444
As if the Balmera was protecting itself.

05:19.528 --> 05:24.741
Now that the Balmera is free and healed,
the crystal caverns are opened once more.

05:30.121 --> 05:33.124
[humming]

05:47.722 --> 05:50.725
[rumbling]

05:57.148 --> 06:00.151
[rumbling]

06:06.074 --> 06:08.285
Of what was that rumble?

06:08.368 --> 06:11.496
Perhaps because a crystal this big
has never been asked for.

06:11.580 --> 06:15.125
No, this is something different.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.043
Shall we stop the ceremony?

06:18.461 --> 06:20.130
[grandmother]
Let her finish.

06:31.975 --> 06:33.059
Thank you.

06:35.812 --> 06:38.565
[Shay] The crystal has been loaded
onto your castle, Princess.

06:40.942 --> 06:44.112
We wish you could stay longer.

06:44.195 --> 06:48.950
I made you stickercup stew
for the sky road.

06:49.034 --> 06:53.622
Oh, thank you.
I'm sure I shall enjoy this immensely.

06:54.372 --> 06:57.667
To all you Balmerans,
thank you once again.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.461
- [rumbling]
- [gasps and screams]

06:59.544 --> 07:01.671
[gasps] What was that?

07:04.090 --> 07:07.093
[crackling]

07:20.023 --> 07:21.149
Oh, no!

07:22.067 --> 07:25.236
[screaming and yelling]

07:28.823 --> 07:30.992
- [gasps]
- Take cover in the Balmera!

07:31.076 --> 07:33.203
I'll hold it off
with the castle's defenses.

07:39.084 --> 07:40.168
Hurry, hurry!

08:01.856 --> 08:03.483
Particle barrier up!

08:09.990 --> 08:11.282
[lasers humming, firing]

08:23.086 --> 08:26.006
Those crystals are acting as shields.

08:40.270 --> 08:41.395
[grunts]

08:41.479 --> 08:43.440
I need to lure it away from the Balmera!

08:43.523 --> 08:45.442
[jet engines revving]

08:54.117 --> 08:56.494
[jet engines revving]

09:13.720 --> 09:16.723
- [Hunk grunts]
- [Keith] I didn't just turn Galra!

09:19.601 --> 09:22.353
Are you trying to see
if my skin is purple?

09:22.437 --> 09:23.521
- No.
- [computer beeps]

09:23.605 --> 09:25.857
[Allura] <i>Hunk, Keith, are you there?</i>
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

09:25.940 --> 09:28.026
Hunk and Keith here.
What's going on, Princess?

09:28.109 --> 09:30.487
<i>You must return to the castle! I need you!</i>

09:31.488 --> 09:32.947
We're on our way.

09:33.948 --> 09:36.076
[Lance] All right,
what are we doing now?

09:36.159 --> 09:38.578
Let's call Allura
and let her know that we have Slav

09:38.661 --> 09:41.081
and we're ready for her
to use the teludav.

09:41.164 --> 09:43.750
You didn't say
we'd be traveling by teludav.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.879
What's the problem?
We're traveling by teludav.

09:47.962 --> 09:49.756
So just count your hair follicles

09:49.839 --> 09:51.633
or fluff a pillow,
or whatever you need to do

09:51.716 --> 09:54.969
to make sure we survive
the wormhole trip in this reality!

09:58.681 --> 09:59.933
I was just going to point out

10:00.016 --> 10:02.352
that the teludav
is a very efficient form of travel.

10:02.435 --> 10:05.396
- [Allura] <i>Paladins, are you there?</i>
- [Lance] Princess, what's happening?

10:05.480 --> 10:08.733
<i>That monster that attacked us</i>
<i>on the Balmera before has returned!</i>

10:08.817 --> 10:10.110
- [all] What?
- [squawks]

10:10.193 --> 10:12.237
[Allura] <i>I need you</i>
<i>back here immediately.</i>

10:12.320 --> 10:15.115
You got it, Princess.
Sharpshooter is on the way.

10:15.198 --> 10:16.616
Sharpshooter?

10:16.699 --> 10:19.828
It's my new nickname that I gave myself.
Just-- Just pass it on.

10:22.497 --> 10:24.040
[Shiro] Ready when you are, Allura.

10:40.014 --> 10:43.685
[Lance] Whoa! How is that thing
operational? It doesn't have a head!

10:43.768 --> 10:46.938
[Pidge] I don't know, but I'm sure it has
something to do with those crystals.

10:47.021 --> 10:49.440
[Shiro] We can't worry about that now.
We have to protect the castle.

10:49.524 --> 10:50.775
[whimpering]

10:50.859 --> 10:52.485
How did we beat it last time?

10:52.569 --> 10:54.404
We formed Voltron,
then I stuck in my Bayard

10:54.487 --> 10:56.656
and shot it with my blaster
right in its arm lasers.

10:56.739 --> 10:59.617
But that didn't stop it
so then we had to punch it.

10:59.701 --> 11:02.871
- So we're gonna need Voltron.
- But we only have two lions.

11:02.954 --> 11:05.039
Well, maybe we can form
the legs and kick it?

11:09.085 --> 11:10.295
[Lance] Whoa!

11:19.053 --> 11:23.433
That new laser is much more powerful.
We're definitely gonna need all the lions.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.810
Hunk, you distract it
so we can fly into the castle.

11:25.894 --> 11:29.480
Once we get our lions out, we'll cover you
so you can fly Keith in for Red.

11:29.564 --> 11:32.150
[Hunk] Wait, wait, wait.
I have to hold that thing off by myself?

11:32.233 --> 11:33.109
[Pidge] <i>You have Keith.</i>

11:33.192 --> 11:35.361
Yeah, but he's in here with me!

11:35.445 --> 11:37.614
[Shiro] <i>There's no time to argue.</i>
<i>We got to do this now.</i>

11:38.364 --> 11:40.074
[Hunk] Oh, Quiznak.

12:04.933 --> 12:06.225
[grunts, groans]

12:07.769 --> 12:12.065
Commander Thace,
did you find what you were looking for?

12:12.148 --> 12:14.067
[groaning]

12:14.943 --> 12:17.195
Take him to Haggar's lab.

12:24.702 --> 12:26.913
[Hunk] Those crystals
are blocking all of our attacks!

12:28.206 --> 12:29.832
Oh, no!

12:32.835 --> 12:35.546
The castle is doomed
unless we distract that beast.

12:46.265 --> 12:47.767
[Keith] Good, it's chasing us.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.854
[panting]

12:51.938 --> 12:52.939
Ahh...

12:53.022 --> 12:55.483
[Allura] The particle barrier
is severely damaged.

12:55.566 --> 12:57.151
Lance, get back out to give Hunk cover.

12:57.235 --> 12:59.362
- Pidge and I are right behind you.
- You got it, Shiro.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.990
Don't worry about me.
I'll just hang out here.

13:02.073 --> 13:04.200
Can you help the Princess
restore the particle barrier?

13:04.283 --> 13:05.493
Yes.

13:09.288 --> 13:14.293
- Now?
- Oh, you mean in this reality. Got it.

13:14.377 --> 13:16.254
Oh... [whimpering]

13:18.464 --> 13:19.465
[Keith] Bank left!

13:20.842 --> 13:21.759
Barrel roll!

13:23.011 --> 13:25.763
- Nose dive!
- Quit back lion driving!

13:29.350 --> 13:31.519
- [beeping]
- <i>I'll distract it! Go get the Red Lion!</i>

13:31.602 --> 13:33.771
Oh ho ho, good timing, Lance!

13:39.819 --> 13:41.612
[blaster revving up]

13:44.991 --> 13:48.036
[Hunk and Keith]
Aaah!

13:48.119 --> 13:49.454
Guys!

13:56.836 --> 13:57.754
[grunts]

13:58.463 --> 14:00.465
[Keith]
Hunk, do something.

14:00.548 --> 14:03.676
[Hunk] I can't move! I'm hit.
Nothing's working!

14:03.760 --> 14:05.928
Come on, boy. Come back to me.

14:13.770 --> 14:16.397
- [Pidge] We need to protect Hunk.
- [Shiro] I've got him!

14:37.418 --> 14:39.879
I'm getting real sick of that crystal.
Let's take it out.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.131
[Pidge] On it.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.428
[screaming, groaning]

14:54.852 --> 14:57.230
[Pidge] Shiro,
it's on its way to the castle!

14:57.313 --> 14:59.565
- [Shiro] I got it!
- [Hunk] Well, who's got me?

15:00.900 --> 15:02.235
Where are you going?

15:02.318 --> 15:04.487
I'll jump out and jetpack over
to the castle.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.989
[laughs] Good one.
Wait, serious?

15:07.073 --> 15:08.449
[Shiro] Form jaw blade!

15:19.752 --> 15:21.254
<i>Got to hurry!</i>

15:29.470 --> 15:33.307
[Pidge] We'll keep the crystals busy.
Shiro, you attack from the other side.

15:33.391 --> 15:34.475
[Shiro]
On my way.

15:36.727 --> 15:38.146
[grunting]

15:38.229 --> 15:39.230
[growls]

15:46.446 --> 15:48.489
[Hunk] Hey, my lion's working again!

15:48.573 --> 15:50.575
I'm back, baby!

15:54.203 --> 15:56.581
Okay. Let's go.

15:56.664 --> 15:58.833
Oh, whoa. Wait, what?

15:58.916 --> 16:01.169
Oh, man! Not again!

16:05.923 --> 16:07.508
Oh, no, no, no!

16:24.233 --> 16:26.277
Sorry I'm late, guys.

16:29.447 --> 16:30.990
Okay, let's form Voltron

16:31.073 --> 16:32.825
and take this thing down
like we did last time.

16:32.909 --> 16:34.744
I don't think the Robeast
is gonna sit around

16:34.827 --> 16:36.454
and wait for us to transform.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.956
Keith's right.
We'll need to think of something else.

16:39.916 --> 16:42.460
[Hunk] Hey, at least we outnumber
those crystal shields.

16:42.543 --> 16:44.212
[Lance] Yeah, he can only block
two of us.

16:44.962 --> 16:46.422
[Pidge] I think I've got an idea.

16:47.965 --> 16:51.385
Guys, see if you can get me
an open shot at its chest.

16:51.469 --> 16:52.512
[Shiro] Got it!

16:57.266 --> 16:58.434
[crackling]

17:04.732 --> 17:05.775
[Shiro] Nice job, Pidge.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.903
- Now form Voltron!
- [all] Yeah!

18:08.004 --> 18:09.422
[all yelling]

18:20.725 --> 18:22.768
[electricity crackling]

18:32.361 --> 18:33.904
[Allura]
<i>Great work, Paladins.</i>

18:33.988 --> 18:37.074
<i>Now return to the castle</i>
<i>so we can get back to Olkarion.</i>

18:37.158 --> 18:39.160
[beeping]

18:41.871 --> 18:44.665
Why is there a grand entrance
on the 40th floor?

18:44.749 --> 18:45.916
And what's with all the ziplines?

18:46.000 --> 18:48.252
You have hover technology.

18:48.336 --> 18:49.295
Well, you know what?

18:49.378 --> 18:51.672
Ziplines were quite fashionable
10,000 years ago.

18:51.756 --> 18:55.801
- Allura, have you heard from Coran?
- Yes.

18:57.219 --> 19:00.640
So we ready to pop through the wormhole
and get back to Olkarion?

19:00.723 --> 19:05.227
Yes, I've checked in with Coran
and the teludav is nearly complete.

19:05.311 --> 19:08.022
Hunk, thank you
for getting the scaultrite.

19:08.105 --> 19:09.106
No problem.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.026
You know, Keith was there too.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.590
[Coran] We've made great progress
while you were gone.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.133
And now that we have the scaultrite,

19:36.217 --> 19:38.094
we should be finished
in less than a quintant.

19:39.095 --> 19:42.932
[Lance] Wow.
That is one giant teludav.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.600
[Keith] Nice work, Coran.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.602
Good job, Coran. Fist bump.

19:47.978 --> 19:49.480
Now blow it up.

19:49.563 --> 19:52.942
Oh, don't you dare!
It took forever to build this teludav.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.694
And let's not forget it's a pivotal piece

19:54.777 --> 19:57.238
that we need for our plan
to defeat Zarkon.

19:57.321 --> 19:58.906
- [beeping]
- Aaah!

19:58.989 --> 20:01.200
I've made some improvements
to your design.

20:01.283 --> 20:06.205
This will increase our chances of survival
in this reality 205 percent.

20:07.123 --> 20:08.499
- Is this guy a little--?
- Yes.

20:08.582 --> 20:10.334
- No doubt.
- Not a fan.

20:10.418 --> 20:12.461
[Coran] Stop hitting the teludav!

20:12.545 --> 20:15.047
- [explosion]
- [Slav] Ow.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.307
[footsteps approaching]

20:25.391 --> 20:26.308
[Coran] Princess,

20:28.102 --> 20:30.229
there's something
I've been meaning to talk to you about.

20:30.312 --> 20:31.605
What is it, Coran?

20:32.606 --> 20:34.483
This plan of ours, it's...

20:34.567 --> 20:36.360
Well, it's dangerous, you know?

20:36.444 --> 20:39.989
We're taking certain risks.
You are taking certain risks.

20:40.072 --> 20:43.576
This teludav,
the amount of exertion it will take...

20:43.659 --> 20:46.996
I ju-- You may not survive.

20:47.872 --> 20:50.583
Coran, I know the risks.

20:58.424 --> 21:01.427
Your father would be proud of the leader
that you've become.

21:10.770 --> 21:11.937
What's everybody thinking about?

21:12.021 --> 21:13.481
- Zarkon.
- Calzones.

21:15.524 --> 21:18.736
I mean, uh, heck, yeah,
I'm thinking about calzones, okay?

21:18.819 --> 21:20.780
I mean, does it always
have to be about Zarkon?

21:20.863 --> 21:23.407
He's a bad guy.
We're trying to defeat him. I get it.

21:23.491 --> 21:25.576
- I'm hungry.
- [stomach rumbles]

21:27.161 --> 21:28.704
We've come a long way.

21:29.830 --> 21:32.708
Yeah, remember when Hunk used
to throw up from riding in the elevator?

21:33.292 --> 21:34.376
[groans]

21:34.460 --> 21:39.006
You guys remember that Arusian, Klaizap?
I think his name was? Cool name.

21:39.089 --> 21:42.593
[chuckles] Yeah, Keith tried to beat him
up even though he's the size of a peanut.

21:42.676 --> 21:44.595
He was their bravest warrior!

21:45.638 --> 21:48.432
How about the time the food goo machines
attacked us in the kitchen?

21:48.516 --> 21:50.601
That was the scariest thing
that's happened to me

21:50.684 --> 21:52.561
the entire time I've been here.

21:52.645 --> 21:55.272
- Oh, come on.
- What? It's the truth!

21:55.356 --> 21:57.733
[Lance] We faced sentries,
a haunted castle,

21:57.817 --> 22:00.152
giant Robeasts, a mall security guard.

22:00.236 --> 22:04.949
- And don't forget that cool cube thing.
- Yeah, and that awful cube thing.

22:05.032 --> 22:11.497
You realize once we defeat Zarkon,
the universe won't need Voltron anymore.

22:12.873 --> 22:16.377
- We can return to Earth.
- I can look for my family.

22:16.460 --> 22:18.254
I guess I could look for mine.

22:18.337 --> 22:19.630
This is it.

22:19.713 --> 22:23.592
As long as everything goes
according to plan, we can't fail.

22:39.775 --> 22:41.193
No more questions.

22:42.069 --> 22:46.031
I'll get the truth out of you
one way or another.

22:46.115 --> 22:49.118
- [drills whirring]
- [machines clicking]
