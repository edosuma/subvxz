Previously on "Ghost Whisperer..."

00:02.100 --> 00:03.174
What do the shadows
want with my son?

00:03.208 --> 00:05.357
Whatever they are,
wherever they live,

00:05.391 --> 00:08.887
These shadows are very
interested in ghost children.

00:08.921 --> 00:10.768
Bedford. What are you doing here?

00:10.803 --> 00:13.218
Remember this...
nothing is what it seems.

00:13.252 --> 00:15.774
Trust nothing, and no one.

00:15.808 --> 00:17.954
Carl, what's going on?

00:17.989 --> 00:19.294
I sense them around me sometimes

00:19.328 --> 00:21.831
And I'll suddenly
feel so confused.

00:21.832 --> 00:23.084
You mean the shadows.

00:23.118 --> 00:25.663
It's like they're
getting inside my head.

00:30.964 --> 00:33.108
I could change my mind,

00:33.143 --> 00:35.653
As long as I don't let go, right?

00:38.471 --> 00:41.282
I'm going to leave it here.

00:47.679 --> 00:49.088
I know.

00:49.122 --> 00:50.627
But it's a...

00:50.661 --> 00:52.736
Sacrifice, like you said.

00:52.771 --> 00:54.446
See?

00:58.132 --> 01:00.174
Checkmate.

01:00.208 --> 01:02.850
Uh, hey. Sorry, buddy,

01:02.888 --> 01:03.891
But, um, we gotta go.

01:03.925 --> 01:05.263
It's OK. I won.

01:05.297 --> 01:06.801
Cool.

01:06.835 --> 01:07.838
Who you playing?

01:07.873 --> 01:10.084
Just Carl. He's teaching me.

01:10.118 --> 01:12.226
Carl? Yeah. You know,

01:12.260 --> 01:14.167
The watcher.

01:14.202 --> 01:16.912
Right.

01:23.539 --> 01:25.380
The details are impressive.

01:25.414 --> 01:27.959
My father collected stuff.

01:27.993 --> 01:29.097
Obviously.

01:29.131 --> 01:30.334
There's a ton more.

01:30.369 --> 01:32.076
I'm helping Gale
sell her dad's house.

01:32.110 --> 01:34.017
Yeah. He passed away last year.

01:34.051 --> 01:36.358
I'm so sorry. Thank you.

01:36.392 --> 01:39.503
So you think any of this
junk is worth anything?

01:39.537 --> 01:41.510
Everything is to somebody.

01:41.545 --> 01:43.385
Oh.

01:43.419 --> 01:46.496
Oh, it's my boyfriend.

01:46.530 --> 01:48.670
Excuse me.

01:48.704 --> 01:50.476
Hey, Kyle.

01:50.511 --> 01:52.716
Yeah, I'm at the
antique store now.

01:52.750 --> 01:54.354
You did?

01:54.388 --> 01:56.058
2 bedrooms, really?

01:56.092 --> 01:57.327
She and her boyfriend
are moving to the city.

01:57.362 --> 02:00.269
He's apartment hunting.
Well, when will we know?

02:00.303 --> 02:02.541
Ok, I'll keep my
fingers crossed, too.

02:02.575 --> 02:03.944
Yeah. Love you.

02:06.388 --> 02:07.623
Everything OK?

02:07.658 --> 02:09.530
Yeah, yeah, sorry.

02:09.564 --> 02:11.436
Um, it's just...

02:11.470 --> 02:13.976
It's a lot to process, you know?

02:14.010 --> 02:16.251
Selling my dad's house
and moving in with Kyle.

02:16.285 --> 02:17.988
Both of which my dad
would have hated.

02:18.023 --> 02:19.727
He didn't like your boyfriend?

02:19.762 --> 02:21.133
No, not really.

02:21.167 --> 02:24.108
And he especially did not like
the idea of us living together.

02:24.143 --> 02:25.111
He was pretty old school.

02:25.146 --> 02:27.317
But we waited,
6 months after he died,

02:27.352 --> 02:28.387
You know?

02:28.421 --> 02:30.126
Life goes on, right?

02:30.160 --> 02:32.432
It does. Ok, well,

02:32.466 --> 02:33.668
Why don't you just give me a call

02:33.703 --> 02:35.072
When you want to come see
the rest of the stuff?

02:35.108 --> 02:37.213
I will.

02:37.247 --> 02:40.755
I just hope my dad
can rest in peace,

02:40.789 --> 02:42.260
You know?

02:44.934 --> 02:46.772
Poor girl.

02:46.806 --> 02:49.213
She's still grieving. Yeah.

02:49.247 --> 02:52.388
But she's in love,
so I'm sure it'll be fine

02:52.422 --> 02:54.326
Once they get settled in.

02:56.300 --> 02:59.507
Oh, come on.

03:05.054 --> 03:07.957
"over my dead body"?

03:07.991 --> 03:09.891
Let me guess...

03:09.926 --> 03:12.159
Gale's dad.

03:12.193 --> 03:15.360
So much for resting in peace.

03:54.700 --> 03:56.166
Your dad was very eclectic.

03:56.201 --> 03:59.035
We tried to get him
to go to therapy.

03:59.069 --> 04:00.335
I mean,

04:00.370 --> 04:02.035
Look at all this stuff.

04:02.070 --> 04:04.003
He started collecting

04:04.037 --> 04:05.571
After my mom divorced him.

04:05.605 --> 04:07.639
It's textbook.

04:10.275 --> 04:12.143
I gave him this.

04:12.177 --> 04:14.378
I was hoping it would get my dad

04:14.413 --> 04:16.813
Used to the idea of me
and Kyle as a couple.

04:16.846 --> 04:20.016
Figures he would shove it
in the back of a drawer.

04:20.050 --> 04:22.318
You said your dad
didn't like Kyle?

04:22.352 --> 04:24.519
Well, when Kyle asked
me to move in with him,

04:24.554 --> 04:27.222
My dad said he was just
trying to corrupt me.

04:27.256 --> 04:28.924
He was so Victorian.

04:28.958 --> 04:30.759
It's nice to talk to somebody.

04:30.793 --> 04:33.994
My dad was...

04:34.028 --> 04:37.664
Is something burning?

04:38.767 --> 04:40.567
Oh, my God.

04:41.803 --> 04:43.370
What the...

04:44.606 --> 04:47.941
What just happened? Oh, my God?

04:47.975 --> 04:49.575
Did you...?

04:49.610 --> 04:51.243
No! No, of course I didn't.

04:51.277 --> 04:53.445
Yeah, well, things don't
just burst into flame.

04:53.479 --> 04:55.146
I didn't.

04:55.181 --> 04:57.548
Someone else did.
Then what happened?

04:57.583 --> 05:00.283
What are you talking about?

05:00.317 --> 05:03.018
Look, this is going
to sound strange...

05:03.052 --> 05:05.787
Really, really, strange,

05:05.821 --> 05:08.023
But I don't think your
father's quite moved on.

05:08.057 --> 05:10.191
I think he's still here. I...

05:10.226 --> 05:13.961
I can talk to ghosts.
It's a GI I have.

05:13.995 --> 05:16.029
You're saying that...

05:16.063 --> 05:17.964
You've seen dad?

05:17.998 --> 05:20.065
No. No, but he's
sending you a message,

05:20.100 --> 05:23.335
And he sent one to me yesterday.

05:23.369 --> 05:24.802
How?

05:24.837 --> 05:27.138
He used scrabble
tiles to spell out

05:27.172 --> 05:28.639
"over my dead body."

05:29.774 --> 05:31.408
How do you know that?

05:31.443 --> 05:32.775
"over my dead body,"

05:32.810 --> 05:34.343
That is exactly
what he used to say

05:34.378 --> 05:37.112
Every time I even
brought up the subject

05:37.146 --> 05:38.246
Of moving in with Kyle.

05:38.280 --> 05:40.147
I mean, it just made him so angry.

05:40.182 --> 05:42.549
I think he's still angry.

05:42.584 --> 05:44.983
Maybe angry enough to
put you and Kyle danger.

05:45.018 --> 05:47.586
That explains so much.

05:47.621 --> 05:50.222
Ever since my dad died

05:50.257 --> 05:53.325
And Kyle and I started
looking for a place together,

05:53.360 --> 05:57.530
I have felt this really
angry energy around us.

05:57.564 --> 06:00.065
Which I know, sounds nuts, but...

06:01.900 --> 06:04.068
So this is real?

06:05.137 --> 06:06.704
Ok, I have to call Kyle.

06:06.739 --> 06:07.872
I can't move in with him.

06:07.906 --> 06:10.274
No, no, no, please. Please.

06:10.308 --> 06:13.010
I think that I can bring you
and your father some peace

06:13.045 --> 06:14.678
So that he can go into the light.

06:14.713 --> 06:16.080
You can do that?

06:16.114 --> 06:19.316
I'll do the best I can.

06:19.350 --> 06:20.784
So I reminded him, calmly,

06:20.819 --> 06:22.920
That he's not supposed to talk
to strangers, living or dead.

06:22.954 --> 06:24.054
You know what he said to me?

06:24.088 --> 06:26.056
"Carl is not a stranger."

06:26.091 --> 06:27.891
Well, he's got a point.

06:27.926 --> 06:29.225
It's happening a lot, you know?

06:29.250 --> 06:30.449
Carl's talking to
him all the time.

06:30.484 --> 06:31.851
About what?

06:31.885 --> 06:34.753
I don't know. First it was chess,
now maybe it's pinochle.

06:34.787 --> 06:36.669
Ah, look, the point is,

06:36.700 --> 06:37.899
I thought watchers
were supposed to watch

06:37.933 --> 06:39.599
And not, you know, play a game.

06:39.634 --> 06:41.032
Well, I'm about to pick up Aiden,

06:41.067 --> 06:42.767
So I'll call you back, OK? Bye.

06:42.801 --> 06:44.736
Hey. How was your talk with Gale?

06:44.770 --> 06:46.136
It was fine.

06:46.171 --> 06:48.105
You know, I just had to bring
up the whole ghost thing

06:48.139 --> 06:49.873
Earlier than I wanted to.
Where's Aiden?

06:49.907 --> 06:51.607
Oh, he's around here somewhere.

06:51.641 --> 06:54.107
Ok, I don't...uh...

06:54.141 --> 06:56.642
I don't see him. Aiden?

07:01.980 --> 07:04.147
Delia, what's going on? You said that
you were going to look after him.

07:04.181 --> 07:06.682
I don't know. He was just here.

07:07.500 --> 07:10.768
Hey, mommy! I'm up here!

07:10.803 --> 07:13.334
Oh, my God! Aiden!

07:13.402 --> 07:16.249
Aiden, don't move!
Please call 9-1-1!

07:16.250 --> 07:17.550
It's OK, mommy, look! I'm up here!

07:17.584 --> 07:19.751
Sure hope he can fly.

07:19.785 --> 07:21.719
Hey, mommy, I can see
forever from here!

07:21.753 --> 07:23.920
Ok, this is a vision.

07:23.955 --> 07:25.688
This just has to be a vision.
This isn't real, right?!

07:25.722 --> 07:27.288
Only you know the answer to that.

07:27.323 --> 07:28.923
Make it stop.

07:28.957 --> 07:31.924
Oh, God. Melinda, make it stop.

07:31.958 --> 07:35.025
Mommy! Whoa! No!

07:39.460 --> 07:41.027
No! Wake up, mommy!

07:41.062 --> 07:42.595
Wake up! Melinda!

07:42.629 --> 07:43.729
Oh, my God.

07:43.763 --> 07:45.497
It was a vision! You're OK!

07:45.531 --> 07:48.266
Yeah, but you were
screaming really loud!

07:48.300 --> 07:50.868
Hey, you want to take a picture?

07:50.902 --> 07:52.536
It was real.

07:52.570 --> 07:53.904
It felt so real.

07:53.938 --> 07:56.239
Honey, they're just
getting worse and worse.

07:56.273 --> 07:58.375
Ok.

07:58.409 --> 07:59.810
I'm gonna get him out of here now.

07:59.844 --> 08:02.681
Ok? Come on.

08:02.715 --> 08:06.018
So why is Carl teaching
you those games?

08:06.052 --> 08:07.519
I don't know.

08:07.553 --> 08:08.987
Am I in trouble?

08:09.021 --> 08:12.222
No. No, it's just maybe you
can tell us when he's around.

08:12.257 --> 08:13.790
Listen, Aiden,

08:13.825 --> 08:15.192
That vision that mommy had,

08:15.227 --> 08:16.593
Did you see anything?

08:16.628 --> 08:19.129
No. Just you freaking out.

08:19.163 --> 08:22.899
And who's that?

08:22.933 --> 08:24.967
Oh, no.

08:25.002 --> 08:28.102
You're Gale's boyfriend,
aren't you?

08:29.403 --> 08:31.570
What happened?

08:31.605 --> 08:34.140
When did you die?

08:34.174 --> 08:35.541
That vision, were you
trying to tell me something?

08:35.575 --> 08:36.909
I think so.

08:36.943 --> 08:38.010
What?

08:38.044 --> 08:39.044
Did you fall?

08:39.078 --> 08:40.345
Something led me to the roof.

08:40.379 --> 08:42.380
Do you know what it was, or who?

08:42.414 --> 08:43.981
I heard a whisper.

08:44.015 --> 08:45.849
It said, "over my dead body."

08:53.423 --> 08:55.825
Hey.

08:55.859 --> 08:58.360
I hope you don't mind me
dropping by like this,

08:58.395 --> 09:00.163
But I just need to keep busy.

09:00.198 --> 09:01.431
Why?

09:01.466 --> 09:03.399
I've been trying to
reach Kyle all day,

09:03.434 --> 09:05.301
And he's just not answering
any of my calls or texts.

09:05.335 --> 09:08.603
It's really weird for him
not to pick up his phone.

09:08.637 --> 09:10.004
Does he have any
friends in the city,

09:10.038 --> 09:11.372
Have you tried them?

09:11.406 --> 09:13.307
What about hospitals?

09:13.341 --> 09:14.775
Or the police?

09:14.809 --> 09:16.776
No. Why?

09:16.811 --> 09:19.412
Do you know something?

09:19.446 --> 09:20.846
Is Kyle OK?

09:20.881 --> 09:22.448
Tell me!

09:22.482 --> 09:24.182
You should sit.

09:29.988 --> 09:33.223
Kyle appeared to me today.

09:33.257 --> 09:34.524
Appeared to you?

09:34.558 --> 09:39.227
Are you saying that
you saw Kyle's ghost?

09:39.261 --> 09:43.630
Are you telling me
that Kyle is dead?

09:43.665 --> 09:46.599
He said that your father
caused an accident.

09:46.633 --> 09:48.033
Oh, my God.

09:48.068 --> 09:51.069
Oh, my God, please tell me what
you are saying is not true.

09:51.103 --> 09:52.791
I really didn't think that I was going
to have to be the one to tell you..

09:52.871 --> 09:54.604
No, no, no, no, no, no!

09:57.341 --> 10:00.675
I just got a text from Kyle

10:00.709 --> 10:02.509
Saying that he has
a surprise for me,

10:02.544 --> 10:04.844
So what you're
saying can't be true.

10:04.878 --> 10:07.012
Ghosts can manipulate electronics.

10:08.948 --> 10:10.348
Kyle?! Hey!

10:10.416 --> 10:12.316
Kyle, you're here!

10:12.350 --> 10:14.184
Of course I'm here.
I got your text.

10:14.218 --> 10:15.819
Didn't you get mine?

10:17.921 --> 10:20.055
You didn't answer your phone all day,
and then I thought...

10:20.090 --> 10:22.490
I'm sorry, I left it in the car

10:22.524 --> 10:24.324
While I was signing the lease.

10:24.358 --> 10:26.692
We got the apartment!
You should be happy!

10:26.726 --> 10:29.228
Melinda told me
that you were dead.

10:29.263 --> 10:30.763
What?

10:30.797 --> 10:34.066
Yeah. And she said that my
dad has been haunting us.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.201
And then she just said

10:35.235 --> 10:36.902
She saw your ghost!

10:36.937 --> 10:38.739
My ghost?

10:38.773 --> 10:40.241
Are you kidding me?
What kind of nutcase

10:40.275 --> 10:41.442
Goes around saying
stuff like that?

10:41.477 --> 10:42.877
It's true, I...

10:42.911 --> 10:44.011
I'm sorry,

10:44.045 --> 10:46.112
Who are you, and why
would you do this to Gale

10:46.146 --> 10:47.413
After what she's been through?

10:47.447 --> 10:48.514
If you would please
just let me explain...

10:48.548 --> 10:49.515
Save your breath, OK?

10:49.549 --> 10:51.283
Come on, Gale,
let's get out of here.

10:52.420 --> 10:54.996
And make sure you return
all of her dad's things.

10:54.997 --> 10:56.741
And stay the hell away
from us, I mean it.

11:09.700 --> 11:11.133
Are you sure the ghost was Kyle?

11:11.168 --> 11:13.102
Yes. No.

11:13.136 --> 11:14.203
I think it was.

11:14.237 --> 11:15.470
I can't believe he walked in

11:15.505 --> 11:17.505
Right after you told Gale
he was dead. Yeah, I know.

11:17.539 --> 11:18.939
It's not the first time
I've been called crazy,

11:18.973 --> 11:21.241
But usually it's not true.

11:21.275 --> 11:22.642
Did the ghost tell you that?

11:22.676 --> 11:24.344
That Gale's father's
ghost killed him?

11:24.378 --> 11:25.812
Yeah, pretty much.
He was right there on the square

11:25.846 --> 11:27.180
After I saw Aiden on the roof.

11:27.214 --> 11:29.582
Couldn't that have been one
part of the same vision?

11:29.616 --> 11:31.717
Yeah, but if the
ghost wasn't really

11:31.751 --> 11:33.585
A ghost, who'd the
vision come from?

11:33.620 --> 11:35.287
Could Aiden have channeled it? No.

11:35.321 --> 11:36.888
He said he didn't
remember anything.

11:36.922 --> 11:38.422
Although Jim says that
Carl's been hanging out

11:38.457 --> 11:40.091
With him a lot lately.
I just don't understand

11:40.125 --> 11:42.759
What that has to do with me
seeing a ghost who wasn't dead.

11:42.794 --> 11:44.361
Unless it wasn't Kyle,

11:44.395 --> 11:46.696
But really Gale's father
making himself appear as Kyle.

11:46.730 --> 11:48.064
Well, can a ghost do that?

11:48.098 --> 11:50.099
Look like someone else?
Not usually.

11:50.133 --> 11:53.202
But why would Gale's father
picture himself as Kyle?

11:53.236 --> 11:54.936
Maybe we're thinking
about this too hard.

11:54.971 --> 11:56.671
What if it was Kyle's ghost?

11:56.705 --> 11:58.239
What if he had a
near-death experience

11:58.273 --> 12:00.774
Where he was dead long enough for
his spirit to come and see you?

12:00.809 --> 12:02.876
And didn't mention it
to his own girlfriend?

12:02.910 --> 12:04.277
Maybe he didn't want to upset her.

12:04.311 --> 12:05.345
Maybe it's simpler than that.

12:05.379 --> 12:07.013
Maybe Kyle just has
a dead twin brother.

12:07.047 --> 12:08.314
Ooh, good one.

12:08.348 --> 12:09.681
Although I haven't seen
any siblings online.

12:09.716 --> 12:11.650
Ok, if you need to
talk to Kyle again,

12:11.684 --> 12:13.318
You might want to send Eli.

12:13.352 --> 12:14.853
One step ahead of you.

12:25.429 --> 12:27.496
Are you really trying to scare me?

12:27.531 --> 12:30.132
I have so few pleasures, you know.

12:30.166 --> 12:32.368
Well, I'm glad I could be a
source of amusement for you.

12:32.402 --> 12:34.303
You have such a nice boy,

12:34.337 --> 12:37.005
And so good at chess for his age.

12:37.040 --> 12:38.673
Very patient with the game.

12:38.708 --> 12:40.375
You could learn a
few things from him.

12:40.409 --> 12:42.644
Look, I would like to learn
a thing or two from you.

12:42.678 --> 12:44.845
I don't have any answers
about your visions

12:44.879 --> 12:47.680
Or this ghost who's not
a ghost, I'm sorry.

12:49.182 --> 12:51.883
Why are you suddenly teaching
my son to play chess?

12:51.918 --> 12:54.619
I had a family to be with once,

12:54.653 --> 12:56.454
But they can't hear me

12:56.488 --> 12:59.490
Or see me anymore. Yours can.

12:59.524 --> 13:02.826
Well, that's nice, but doesn't
help me with the warnings

13:02.861 --> 13:04.494
You gave me the other night.

13:04.529 --> 13:04.642
Look,

13:04.643 --> 13:05.548
You said that you felt like the

13:05.549 --> 13:06.863
Shadows were trying to
get inside your head.

13:06.897 --> 13:08.664
Is that what they're doing to me?

13:08.699 --> 13:11.233
Is that why I'm having
all those visions?

13:11.267 --> 13:16.204
I supposed anything is possible.

13:16.238 --> 13:19.940
Can you understand how
these conversations

13:19.975 --> 13:21.275
Make me want to wring
your nonexistent neck?

13:21.309 --> 13:23.810
Can you understand that I'm
already bending the rules

13:23.845 --> 13:25.645
Just by being here? You need to do

13:25.680 --> 13:28.181
What you need to do,
not what I tell you.

13:28.216 --> 13:31.317
Well, the good thing is,
you didn't tell me anything.

13:31.351 --> 13:33.185
If you say so.

13:36.489 --> 13:37.823
Hey, what did you find out?

13:37.857 --> 13:40.058
That my powers of deception
aren't up to snuff.

13:40.093 --> 13:41.626
What do you mean?

13:41.660 --> 13:42.826
I went down to the law office

13:42.861 --> 13:44.127
Where Kyle works and
I talked to him.

13:44.162 --> 13:46.729
And? And he blew my cover.

13:46.764 --> 13:49.331
I guess I should have made more
small talk about real lawyers

13:49.366 --> 13:51.466
Versus draftityourself.Com

13:51.501 --> 13:54.069
Before getting into
near-death experiences.

13:54.103 --> 13:55.670
Ok, and what did he say?

13:55.704 --> 13:57.337
He said no to having
died recently,

13:57.372 --> 13:59.339
No to having a dead
identical twin,

13:59.373 --> 14:01.674
And then he said tell that
crazy antique store lady

14:01.708 --> 14:03.675
To leave him and his
girlfriend alone.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.443
Oh, and then he called security.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.077
Oh, goody.

14:07.112 --> 14:08.412
Someone's home.

14:08.446 --> 14:10.350
Bye.

14:12.252 --> 14:14.054
Hello?

14:15.189 --> 14:17.423
Gale?

14:18.658 --> 14:20.592
Gale?

14:31.334 --> 14:33.135
No, no! No, stop it!

14:33.169 --> 14:34.302
Please!

14:34.336 --> 14:35.603
Don't do this! I...

14:35.638 --> 14:37.872
What are you doing?!

14:37.906 --> 14:39.507
Gale!

14:39.541 --> 14:42.042
I'm so sorry.
I know what this looks like.

14:42.076 --> 14:43.209
What is wrong with you?

14:43.244 --> 14:45.078
You should leave.

14:45.112 --> 14:47.079
You have no reason,
no reason to believe me.

14:47.113 --> 14:49.147
But I didn't do this.

14:49.182 --> 14:50.514
A ghost did, OK?

14:50.549 --> 14:52.283
At first I thought
it was Gale's father,

14:52.317 --> 14:54.485
Now I'm not so sure, and just
because I don't know who it is...

14:54.519 --> 14:55.552
You're a sick person.

14:55.587 --> 14:57.154
You said it yourself,

14:57.188 --> 14:58.421
That you felt a presence.

14:58.455 --> 15:01.824
You did?

15:08.796 --> 15:09.963
Who are you?

15:09.997 --> 15:12.798
Why are you haunting these people?

15:12.832 --> 15:16.101
For revenge.

15:17.203 --> 15:18.236
Please leave now.

15:18.271 --> 15:20.105
Otherwise I'm calling the police.

15:24.142 --> 15:27.410
Ok.

15:31.600 --> 15:33.276
Look, I feel lousy

15:33.277 --> 15:35.525
Having this meeting
behind Melinda's back,

15:35.526 --> 15:38.557
But I'm really worried about her.

15:38.600 --> 15:39.800
I know, me, too.

15:39.801 --> 15:42.503
But ever since the explosion,
since Bedford...

15:42.705 --> 15:44.760
I know. I know that was bad,

15:44.761 --> 15:46.633
But I think what
happened with Bedford

15:46.634 --> 15:48.206
Was actually just a warning.

15:48.250 --> 15:50.811
And bringing this stuff
up to Mel is so pointless.

15:50.900 --> 15:52.299
I know. You run into the wall.

15:52.300 --> 15:54.867
You know, every earthbound
spirit belongs in the light.

15:54.902 --> 15:56.669
Right, and nothing
is more important

15:56.703 --> 15:58.304
Than crossing them over. Yeah.

15:58.338 --> 16:00.539
Least of all her safety.

16:00.573 --> 16:02.441
Ned, what do you think?

16:02.475 --> 16:04.375
I mean, these visions that
Melinda can't tell from reality,

16:04.410 --> 16:07.145
Does it have something to do with
the bond between her and Aiden?

16:07.179 --> 16:08.613
I mean, between a
mother and her son?

16:08.647 --> 16:11.248
The book doesn't mention it,
but I don't think that...

16:11.283 --> 16:13.083
You know what,
maybe it's not in the book.

16:13.117 --> 16:14.751
Because the answer is so obvious.

16:14.785 --> 16:17.587
This poor girl wrestles
with death day and night,

16:17.621 --> 16:19.788
Then the ghosts never
leave her alone,

16:19.822 --> 16:21.255
Then there's the shadows.

16:21.289 --> 16:23.823
Maybe she's just overwhelmed.

16:23.891 --> 16:25.591
You're probably right.
Look, I know that she's exhausted,

16:25.626 --> 16:26.826
Because I finally was
able to convince her

16:26.860 --> 16:27.827
To take a day off.

16:27.861 --> 16:28.928
Really? Yeah.

16:28.963 --> 16:31.163
I hope it helps. Come on.

16:31.198 --> 16:32.931
Don't you think she
just needs some rest?

16:32.966 --> 16:35.100
I just think she needs more.

16:35.134 --> 16:37.735
You know what, Ned,
I am so thrilled

16:37.769 --> 16:40.069
That you are getting straight
as in goblins and ghouls,

16:40.104 --> 16:42.905
But not everything is a plot
from beyond our dimension.

16:42.940 --> 16:44.342
Ok.

16:44.376 --> 16:46.879
Delia, guys. It's all right.

16:46.914 --> 16:49.481
Ned, tell us what you think.

16:49.516 --> 16:52.984
We know Bedford said the shadows
possess people to talk to them.

16:53.018 --> 16:56.921
And Melinda said Carl was afraid the
shadows were getting in his head.

16:56.955 --> 16:58.856
So...you think the shadows

16:58.890 --> 17:01.224
Are messing with Melinda's head?

17:01.259 --> 17:03.126
Something sure is.

17:03.160 --> 17:04.926
Wait a minute, the last thing
Bedford said to Melinda

17:04.962 --> 17:07.695
Was "trust no one and nothing."

17:07.730 --> 17:10.464
Do you think he could have meant,
you know, don't trust your own eyes?

17:10.499 --> 17:12.500
Can they even do that?

17:12.534 --> 17:16.002
I mean, can they...
can they just create these

17:16.037 --> 17:19.539
Whole alternate realities
and then just inject it

17:19.573 --> 17:20.906
Into her mind?

17:20.940 --> 17:23.174
So far, we haven't seen a
whole lot they can't do.

17:27.112 --> 17:30.013
Not that I'm complaining,
but I thought you had a date tonight.

17:30.048 --> 17:32.449
Oh, um, Mike had to cancel.

17:32.484 --> 17:35.418
Some last minute work thing.

17:35.453 --> 17:37.821
You still trying to dig
up information on Kyle?

17:37.855 --> 17:39.122
There has to be some connection;

17:39.156 --> 17:40.723
Some reason the ghost
looks just like him.

17:40.757 --> 17:42.291
Yeah, but even if
you find something,

17:42.325 --> 17:44.492
Do you really think Kyle
is going to listen to you?

17:44.527 --> 17:46.194
After today? Doubtful.

17:47.396 --> 17:49.263
You know, maybe this would be

17:49.297 --> 17:52.032
A good time for you to
just cut your losses,

17:52.066 --> 17:53.199
Just walk away from this one.

17:53.234 --> 17:54.667
I can't.

17:54.702 --> 17:56.235
How did I know you
were going to say that?

17:56.270 --> 17:57.203
Their ghost is too angry.

17:57.237 --> 17:58.870
If I can just figure out why,

17:58.905 --> 18:00.071
Maybe I can cross him over

18:00.105 --> 18:01.372
Without going back to Kyle.

18:01.406 --> 18:03.540
Look, here's something.

18:03.575 --> 18:05.242
Kyle grew up here in Grandview.

18:05.276 --> 18:07.176
And his dad still lives in town.

18:08.879 --> 18:10.946
Leave it alone.

18:10.981 --> 18:13.315
Who are you?

18:13.349 --> 18:16.017
And why do you keep
appearing as Kyle?

18:16.051 --> 18:17.151
I can help you.

18:17.185 --> 18:18.386
I can help you.

18:18.420 --> 18:20.655
Why don't you mind
your own business?

18:20.689 --> 18:21.989
Look, if you could
just talk to me,

18:22.023 --> 18:24.458
We can figure out what
we need to do to get you

18:24.492 --> 18:26.127
Into the light. The light?

18:26.161 --> 18:28.228
What do you know about the light?

18:28.263 --> 18:30.330
I know that it's peaceful,
and that spirits belong there.

18:30.364 --> 18:31.898
You're wrong.

18:31.932 --> 18:35.033
The light steals people.
It takes them away forever.

18:40.471 --> 18:43.405
Any friend of Gale's
is a friend of mine.

18:43.439 --> 18:45.573
Kyle's a lucky young man.

18:45.608 --> 18:47.408
Please, sit down.

18:47.443 --> 18:49.076
Oh, thank you.

18:49.110 --> 18:51.144
Well, since they're
moving to the city,

18:51.178 --> 18:52.345
I'm throwing a little party,

18:52.380 --> 18:53.847
But I don't know
that much about Kyle.

18:53.881 --> 18:56.049
Ah, didn't want to ruin
the surprise by asking.

18:56.083 --> 18:57.450
I get it.

18:57.485 --> 18:58.785
Well, you came to the right place.

18:58.819 --> 19:03.355
I've been a Kyle expert for,
hmm, almost 20 years now.

19:03.390 --> 19:05.624
I thought he was older than that.

19:05.658 --> 19:07.492
Oh, he is.

19:07.527 --> 19:10.361
But my late wife and I didn't
adopt him until he was 8.

19:10.396 --> 19:11.996
I hate to say it,

19:12.031 --> 19:16.800
Sharon and I, well,
we almost gave up on kids.

19:16.834 --> 19:19.375
Deciding to adopt
the boys was about

19:19.376 --> 19:22.271
The best thing that
ever happened to us.

19:22.306 --> 19:24.039
Ah, here.

19:24.074 --> 19:26.275
There, that's the three of us.

19:26.309 --> 19:27.709
Hmm.

19:27.743 --> 19:29.744
I just wish Sharon
would have lived

19:29.778 --> 19:31.712
Long enough to see
what a great guy

19:31.747 --> 19:32.913
Kyle turned out to b

19:32.948 --> 19:36.250
You said when you decided
to adopt the boys.

19:36.284 --> 19:39.519
By any chance,
did he have a brother?

19:39.554 --> 19:41.020
An identical twin?

19:41.055 --> 19:42.955
Yeah, Seth.

19:42.989 --> 19:47.092
Biological mother
was young, unwed.

19:47.126 --> 19:49.727
So she gave them both up at birth.

19:49.762 --> 19:51.495
But Kyle knew about Seth,
his twin?

19:51.530 --> 19:54.431
Are you kidding?

19:54.465 --> 19:55.699
Those two

19:55.733 --> 19:57.534
Were as thick as thieves.

19:57.568 --> 19:58.701
They grew up

19:58.736 --> 19:59.935
In the foster care system.

19:59.970 --> 20:01.537
I'm surprised they
weren't adopted sooner.

20:01.571 --> 20:03.305
Yeah, we were, too.

20:03.339 --> 20:05.707
But, you know,
they came close several times,

20:05.741 --> 20:07.708
But at the last minute,
one or the other

20:07.743 --> 20:11.211
Would act up and spoil
the whole thing.

20:11.245 --> 20:13.280
So they didn't want to be adopted?

20:13.314 --> 20:14.914
No, they didn't want
to be separated.

20:14.948 --> 20:16.916
They were always afraid
that people would

20:16.950 --> 20:18.551
Change their minds
at the last minute

20:18.585 --> 20:20.486
And take one and not the other.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.821
But Sharon, she convinced them.

20:22.855 --> 20:24.489
She made them understand

20:24.524 --> 20:26.991
That we wanted both of them.

20:27.026 --> 20:31.195
Hmm. At least...
at least Seth knew that

20:31.229 --> 20:33.364
Before he died.

20:33.398 --> 20:35.932
What happened to him?

20:35.966 --> 20:37.267
Well...

20:37.301 --> 20:41.438
He would always climb up to
the roof of the orphanage

20:41.472 --> 20:43.506
Where they lived, at night,

20:43.540 --> 20:47.009
To wish upon the stars.
He was wishing

20:47.043 --> 20:49.277
For a family.

20:49.312 --> 20:50.912
Of course, it was
dangerous up there.

20:50.946 --> 20:55.549
And one night, I guess
he just slipped and fell.

20:55.583 --> 20:57.150
Broke his neck.

20:57.185 --> 20:59.786
I'm so sorry. Yeah.

20:59.820 --> 21:01.988
One week.

21:02.022 --> 21:06.091
One week before we were to bring

21:06.125 --> 21:08.660
Those boys home to live with us.

21:09.929 --> 21:11.729
So Seth was a little
boy when he died?

21:11.764 --> 21:13.897
8 years old.

21:13.932 --> 21:16.933
And, of course, we adopted Kyle,

21:16.968 --> 21:20.036
But he had such a rough
time the first few years

21:20.071 --> 21:22.305
Without Seth.

21:22.339 --> 21:23.372
Huh.

21:23.407 --> 21:26.442
He just couldn't let him go.

21:26.476 --> 21:29.944
I mean, he was just a
little boy himself.

21:32.147 --> 21:34.215
I don't get it.

21:34.249 --> 21:36.316
If Kyle was 8 when he died,
how did his ghost grow up?

21:36.351 --> 21:37.951
Maybe it's some kind
of weird twin thing.

21:37.985 --> 21:39.319
You mean like,
they're identical in life

21:39.353 --> 21:40.753
So they stay identical in death?

21:40.787 --> 21:42.521
Well, if Seth still
feels close to Kyle,

21:42.555 --> 21:43.755
Why would he be haunting him?

21:43.789 --> 21:44.756
Why would he want revenge?

21:44.790 --> 21:46.991
Maybe he's mad at Kyle for living.

21:47.059 --> 21:48.192
That doesn't make any sense.

21:48.226 --> 21:49.493
The ghost said that he
was pushed off the roof.

21:49.528 --> 21:50.994
What if Kyle pushed him?

21:51.029 --> 21:52.963
What if he didn't want to
share his new mom and dad?

21:52.997 --> 21:54.431
You get that kind
of vibe off Kyle?

21:54.465 --> 21:56.065
Well, he did lie to you
about having a twin.

21:56.100 --> 21:58.835
Yeah, but that was just because
he wanted to get rid of me.

21:58.869 --> 22:00.303
Ugh, I gotta go
talk to Kyle again.

22:00.337 --> 22:02.038
Do you want me to go with you?

22:02.072 --> 22:03.739
No, he already doesn't like you.

22:03.774 --> 22:05.140
I was hoping you would say that.

22:06.976 --> 22:08.910
Oh, excuse me,

22:08.945 --> 22:10.979
I was going to open
up but I'm not now.

22:11.013 --> 22:12.280
Are you Melinda Gordon?

22:12.314 --> 22:13.614
Yes, I am.

22:13.649 --> 22:15.182
Ok, well then consider
yourself served.

22:15.216 --> 22:18.384
It's a temporary
restraining order.

22:18.419 --> 22:20.152
You have to stay at least 100
yards away from Kyle Farber

22:20.187 --> 22:22.754
And Gale Thompson at all times.

22:22.788 --> 22:24.655
Do you understand?

22:26.291 --> 22:29.394
You might want to leave
Kyle's dad alone, too,

22:29.428 --> 22:32.164
Unless you want to start
collecting those things.

22:43.611 --> 22:45.278
Hey, what are you doing here?

22:45.312 --> 22:47.045
I live here.

22:47.080 --> 22:48.980
I didn't even hear you come in.

22:52.216 --> 22:54.483
Seth, is that you?

22:54.518 --> 22:57.186
'cause I'm really not in
the mood for a vision.

22:57.220 --> 22:59.554
You don't help anyone.

22:59.588 --> 23:02.789
You can't even help your own son.

23:05.326 --> 23:07.260
It's not real.

23:07.294 --> 23:08.728
Aiden's not even home.

23:08.762 --> 23:10.329
You're not real! Look,
Seth, stop it, all right?

23:10.363 --> 23:13.098
Whatever it is that you're trying to do,
it's not going to work!

23:13.132 --> 23:15.867
Ahh! Ow!

23:15.901 --> 23:17.435
Mommy!

23:17.469 --> 23:19.736
I hurt my head.

23:19.770 --> 23:21.604
First, the fire
station and now this,

23:21.639 --> 23:23.672
Is this about how you died?

23:23.707 --> 23:25.274
Mel, what was that?
What's going on?

23:25.308 --> 23:28.042
Honey, what are you doing?!

23:28.077 --> 23:30.111
Daddy! Aiden?

23:31.313 --> 23:33.447
Mel, he's bleeding!

23:33.482 --> 23:34.815
Aiden's at a play date,

23:34.849 --> 23:37.350
And you're not even
supposed to be home.

23:37.385 --> 23:40.687
No, you remember, I picked him
up early and brought him home.

23:40.721 --> 23:41.654
What is wrong with you?!

23:42.863 --> 23:44.512
I don't know.

23:44.513 --> 23:45.440
All right.

23:45.441 --> 23:47.020
I'm going to take
him to the hospital

23:47.021 --> 23:48.968
And get him checked out now.

24:05.800 --> 24:07.401
Aiden's fine.

24:07.435 --> 24:09.069
Plastic surgeon's
checking him out.

24:09.104 --> 24:10.704
He's not going to need stitches,

24:10.738 --> 24:12.805
But he might have a
tiny little scar.

24:12.839 --> 24:13.805
Oh, God.

24:13.839 --> 24:14.972
Mel, it's all right.

24:15.007 --> 24:16.406
No, it's not all right.

24:16.441 --> 24:18.808
My kid was bleeding.

24:18.842 --> 24:22.080
He was calling out for
me and where was I?

24:22.114 --> 24:24.115
You want me to say it?

24:24.149 --> 24:26.751
You were dealing
with a ghost instead.

24:27.886 --> 24:29.954
Honey, I'm sorry,

24:29.989 --> 24:31.723
But I feel like this is
finally dragging you down, OK?

24:31.757 --> 24:33.291
It's just this ghost.

24:33.325 --> 24:35.059
He just got in my head.

24:35.094 --> 24:36.461
Are you sure? Melinda!

24:36.495 --> 24:38.029
Hey. How is he?

24:38.063 --> 24:39.396
Is Aiden OK?

24:39.431 --> 24:40.697
He's fine. Are you?

24:40.731 --> 24:41.764
Yeah, we're fine.

24:41.798 --> 24:44.031
We're fine enough
to stop this ghost.

24:44.065 --> 24:46.464
You know, it's one thing
to go after me, but Aiden?

24:46.499 --> 24:48.099
Wait a minute, now you think
the ghost is after you?

24:48.134 --> 24:51.001
He tricked me. He lied to me.

24:51.035 --> 24:52.502
All just to make me
look like a fool.

24:52.536 --> 24:54.336
Worse, to make me doubt myself,

24:54.371 --> 24:56.071
And then ultimately
to threaten my kid.

24:56.105 --> 24:57.605
You think this was a warning.

24:57.640 --> 25:00.408
I can stop him.

25:01.410 --> 25:02.944
Seth tipped his hand.

25:02.978 --> 25:04.945
He wants revenge,
and then he kept saying something

25:04.980 --> 25:07.914
About how the light is this
enemy that takes people away.

25:07.948 --> 25:09.782
Someone he loved. But who?

25:09.816 --> 25:11.049
Wait a minute.

25:11.083 --> 25:13.918
Kyle's adopted
father said something

25:13.953 --> 25:16.654
About how his wife died.

25:16.688 --> 25:18.722
Do you have your phone?

25:18.756 --> 25:21.557
Ok, so it was someone you
crossed into the light?

25:21.592 --> 25:23.025
Huh, what are the chances?

25:23.060 --> 25:24.059
In this town, pretty good.

25:24.094 --> 25:25.861
Wait, last name's Farber, right?

25:25.895 --> 25:27.362
Yeah.

25:28.631 --> 25:31.733
"beloved wife of Alan Farber."

25:31.767 --> 25:33.501
She died in the plane crash.

25:33.535 --> 25:35.969
Flight 395.

25:36.004 --> 25:38.238
She was one of the passengers.

25:38.272 --> 25:40.373
Get off the square!

25:55.154 --> 25:57.322
There were so many people.

25:57.356 --> 26:00.091
They all went together.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.729
I'm going to take care of this.

26:03.763 --> 26:06.231
I promise.

26:34.021 --> 26:36.688
Carl, what's going on?

26:36.723 --> 26:39.224
What are you really doing
around my son? Watching.

26:39.258 --> 26:40.658
Carl, I swear...

26:40.693 --> 26:43.060
I'm not joking, Melinda.
I'm watching.

26:43.095 --> 26:44.495
I'm looking out.

26:44.529 --> 26:46.063
For what?

26:46.097 --> 26:48.932
Some ghosts call them
the winds of shames.

26:48.966 --> 26:50.734
Some call them the
night shriekers.

26:50.768 --> 26:54.270
Little ghosts them
the cold things.

26:54.304 --> 26:55.904
You mean the shadows.

26:55.938 --> 26:57.105
He's in danger, Melinda.

26:57.139 --> 26:58.605
Your son is in danger.

26:58.639 --> 27:01.107
No, once I cross this ghost...

27:01.141 --> 27:02.741
Melinda.

27:04.410 --> 27:08.045
It's not going to be over.

27:10.615 --> 27:13.016
Why does he threaten them so much?

27:13.050 --> 27:14.550
They're like birds of prey.

27:14.585 --> 27:17.953
They feed by striking at
things that can't see them.

27:17.987 --> 27:19.522
That's the key to their power.

27:19.556 --> 27:20.990
And Aiden, he...

27:21.024 --> 27:23.191
He can take that away
just by seeing them.

27:23.226 --> 27:25.160
He exposes them,

27:25.194 --> 27:26.529
And then they're weaker.

27:26.563 --> 27:27.997
They won't tolerate that.

27:28.032 --> 27:30.269
And you've seen what
they're willing to do

27:30.303 --> 27:31.770
To their enemies.

27:31.804 --> 27:32.938
So what can I do?

27:32.972 --> 27:35.106
I think you know that, deep down.

27:35.141 --> 27:36.174
How would I know that?

27:36.208 --> 27:38.042
Because it's what
happens to everyone.

27:38.077 --> 27:40.711
They see ghosts,
and then they don't.

27:40.745 --> 27:43.914
So what you're saying
is that I can fix this

27:43.948 --> 27:45.982
If I make Aiden not see ghosts.

27:46.016 --> 27:48.217
Or shadows. Or shinies.

27:48.252 --> 27:49.518
How can I do that?

27:49.553 --> 27:51.187
I told you.
It happens to everyone.

27:51.221 --> 27:55.390
When children are told
what they see isn't real,

27:55.424 --> 27:57.325
Pretty soon they stop seeing it.

27:57.359 --> 27:59.559
Aiden is different.

27:59.594 --> 28:00.627
Maybe.

28:00.661 --> 28:03.229
And maybe what's different is you.

28:03.263 --> 28:05.798
What if you told him
what most children hear,

28:05.832 --> 28:08.533
What you would have heard,
if not for your grandmother,

28:08.567 --> 28:12.137
Maybe he'd turn out just
like all the other kids.

28:12.171 --> 28:13.573
No!

28:14.675 --> 28:17.042
No.

28:17.076 --> 28:19.241
This is him.

28:19.276 --> 28:21.443
This is his gift,
this is who he is.

28:21.478 --> 28:23.645
Are you sure about that?

28:23.679 --> 28:26.380
Are you sure you're not
thinking it's not who you are,

28:26.414 --> 28:29.615
And you want your
child to be the same?

28:29.650 --> 28:32.351
What about everything
that you said?

28:32.385 --> 28:34.919
About this being his destiny?

28:34.954 --> 28:37.555
About what he was supposed
to come here and do?

28:37.589 --> 28:40.492
Do you really care
about any of that?

28:40.527 --> 28:42.596
Of course I do.

28:42.631 --> 28:45.234
More than you care about him?

28:56.942 --> 28:59.208
Hey, it's Jim. Leave a message,

28:59.242 --> 29:00.408
Or page me if it's an emergency.

29:05.113 --> 29:07.014
Whoa, don't come any closer,
I can't be this close to you.

29:07.048 --> 29:09.383
The restraining order.

29:09.417 --> 29:11.284
Oh, never mind about that.

29:11.319 --> 29:13.386
Please. I really
need to talk to you.

29:13.420 --> 29:15.755
Things have gotten
worse with Kyle.

29:15.789 --> 29:17.089
What do you mean?

29:17.124 --> 29:18.557
He talks to himself.

29:18.592 --> 29:19.892
A lot.

29:19.926 --> 29:21.960
Which I guess isn't that big
of a deal, except lately,

29:21.994 --> 29:24.095
When he thinks he's alone,

29:24.130 --> 29:26.697
He even argues with himself.

29:26.732 --> 29:27.898
Loudly.

29:27.933 --> 29:29.866
And it's definitely
worse since we met you.

29:29.901 --> 29:32.636
So you think that I'm the reason
Kyle's talking to himself?

29:32.670 --> 29:36.806
Last night I heard him say
something about Aiden getting hurt.

29:36.841 --> 29:37.974
What? Yeah.

29:38.008 --> 29:39.642
And when I asked him who Aiden is,

29:39.676 --> 29:40.943
He said it's your son.

29:40.977 --> 29:42.911
But then he totally shut me down

29:42.945 --> 29:44.812
When I tried to find
out what your child

29:44.846 --> 29:46.346
Has to do with anything.

29:46.380 --> 29:48.048
Look, I really need to
know what's going on.

29:48.082 --> 29:50.617
There's no way that he could have
known what happened to Aiden.

29:52.486 --> 29:55.053
Unless Seth was there.

29:56.155 --> 29:58.856
Seth? His brother?

29:58.891 --> 30:00.991
But he died, like a long time ago.

30:01.026 --> 30:02.493
Does he ever talk about him? No.

30:02.527 --> 30:05.762
But you said that he's been arguing
with himself a lot recently?

30:05.796 --> 30:09.399
Yeah, and lately it's
getting kind of scary.

30:09.433 --> 30:11.901
Sometimes times break.

30:11.935 --> 30:13.402
Like what happened
at your dad's house

30:13.436 --> 30:14.836
When I went to take
his stuff back.

30:14.870 --> 30:18.339
Not quite like that, but close.

30:18.373 --> 30:20.774
I need to talk to Kyle right now.

30:20.808 --> 30:22.976
Cut it out, Seth, stop it!

30:25.415 --> 30:28.184
You said that you'd help me!
You promised!

30:28.218 --> 30:29.618
Seth!

30:29.653 --> 30:31.954
Seth!

30:31.988 --> 30:34.256
Oh, great, now she's here!

30:34.290 --> 30:35.791
Who?

30:35.825 --> 30:37.225
You see his ghost, too?

30:37.260 --> 30:39.093
You said that you didn't have

30:39.128 --> 30:41.562
A twin brother.
You were lying? Kyle!

30:41.597 --> 30:43.197
What is going on?

30:43.231 --> 30:45.466
Don't talk to them, Kyle.

30:45.500 --> 30:48.301
Look, I was going to tell you
about Seth still being here,

30:48.336 --> 30:49.769
But I didn't know how.

30:49.803 --> 30:51.270
I thought that you'd
think that I'm nuts.

30:51.304 --> 30:53.705
So instead you tried
to make me look nuts?

30:53.740 --> 30:56.341
Why? Punishment?

30:56.375 --> 30:58.443
Because I helped your
mother go into the light?

30:58.477 --> 31:00.245
You took her from us! Seth,
please.

31:00.279 --> 31:02.847
Look, I'm sorry, but we never
meant for your son to get hurt.

31:02.881 --> 31:04.849
Shut up, Kyle,
don't tell her anything!

31:04.883 --> 31:06.383
No, this has gone far enough.

31:06.417 --> 31:07.884
It stops now.

31:07.919 --> 31:09.386
You do whatever you want,

31:09.420 --> 31:11.154
But I'm going to finish
what we started. Seth!

31:11.188 --> 31:14.623
I guess if Melinda thinks
that the light is so special,

31:14.657 --> 31:16.959
Maybe she should
find out for herself!

31:16.993 --> 31:18.927
No, wait a minute!

31:27.100 --> 31:29.468
You know what,
you owe me an explanation.

31:29.502 --> 31:32.337
Seth thinks that you
robbed us of our mother.

31:32.372 --> 31:34.206
You obviously feel the same.

31:35.241 --> 31:37.241
You don't understand.

31:37.276 --> 31:39.143
We were in and out of foster homes

31:39.178 --> 31:40.511
Until we were 8 years old.

31:40.546 --> 31:42.313
We wound up in that group home.

31:42.347 --> 31:44.515
All we ever dreamed of
was having a real family.

31:44.549 --> 31:46.950
And that's when the
Farbers adopted you?

31:46.984 --> 31:49.953
Yeah. We met with
them several times.

31:49.987 --> 31:51.354
We prayed every single night
that they were going to take us.

31:51.388 --> 31:53.890
And then just before
the adoption was final,

31:53.924 --> 31:55.524
Seth went up on the roof.

31:55.559 --> 31:59.528
Wait, are you saying that Seth
has been with you ever since?

31:59.562 --> 32:01.196
I mean, his ghost?

32:01.230 --> 32:03.231
Yeah.

32:03.266 --> 32:05.801
I used to think it was the
whole twin connection thing;

32:05.835 --> 32:08.403
That somehow it
survived ever since,

32:08.437 --> 32:12.173
But I was just happy that I
could still be with my brother.

32:12.208 --> 32:14.142
Mom and dad,
they adopted me anyway.

32:14.177 --> 32:16.310
They didn't know that
Seth was there, too.

32:16.345 --> 32:17.978
But you know what, he loved them.

32:18.013 --> 32:19.280
He loved them so much,

32:19.314 --> 32:21.548
Even though they couldn't
see him like I could.

32:21.583 --> 32:24.217
And that's when your mother died?

32:25.353 --> 32:26.920
And then you sent her away.

32:26.954 --> 32:28.954
You know, she could
have stayed with us.

32:28.989 --> 32:31.356
Kyle, that's not how
this works. Why not?

32:31.391 --> 32:32.591
Huh? I mean, in some ways,

32:32.625 --> 32:33.925
We actually thought
that it might be better,

32:33.959 --> 32:35.660
Because now Seth,
he could have had a real mom, too.

32:35.694 --> 32:39.996
You're saying that you could
have seen your mother's ghost?

32:40.031 --> 32:41.364
Does that mean you have the gift?

32:41.399 --> 32:44.134
No. No, not like you.

32:44.168 --> 32:46.623
Seth's the only ghost
that I've ever seen.

32:47.024 --> 32:47.934
But thanks to you,

32:47.935 --> 32:49.059
I'll never get a
chance to find out

32:49.060 --> 32:50.699
If I could have still had a mom.

32:51.099 --> 32:52.709
You know, the night that
dad got that phone call,

32:52.710 --> 32:53.954
It was terrible.

32:53.955 --> 32:55.666
And the only thing
that helped me and Seth

32:55.667 --> 32:57.488
Get through all of it was
knowing that mom's ghost

32:57.489 --> 32:58.990
Was going to come to us and
that she'd finally know

32:58.991 --> 33:00.732
That she had another kid
that loved her, too.

33:00.733 --> 33:02.671
But you know what,
she never came home!

33:03.391 --> 33:05.210
Because ghosts
belong in the light.

33:05.211 --> 33:07.047
Why? Why does she
belong in the light?

33:07.048 --> 33:08.117
Because you say so?

33:08.118 --> 33:10.837
What makes you think that
you get to decide that?!

33:11.849 --> 33:14.459
Your mother decided
that for herself.

33:15.753 --> 33:18.625
She loved you so much
that she could move on.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.733
She was happy.

33:20.767 --> 33:23.400
You can be happy, Seth can, too.

33:23.434 --> 33:25.969
Baby...

33:27.338 --> 33:29.672
It sounds to me like she's right.

33:29.707 --> 33:34.437
Look, I know how hard it can be to
say good-bye to someone you love.

33:34.471 --> 33:37.238
But for his own good,

33:37.272 --> 33:39.371
And for yours, please...

33:39.405 --> 33:42.473
Help me get your
brother into the light.

34:06.400 --> 34:07.522
Where's Aiden?

34:07.523 --> 34:09.603
He's having dinner at the masons.

34:10.400 --> 34:12.568
We need to talk.

34:14.804 --> 34:17.405
Ok.

34:18.541 --> 34:21.775
You're telling me that these
mindless, hungry things

34:21.810 --> 34:23.210
Want our son?

34:23.244 --> 34:24.678
Yes.

34:24.712 --> 34:26.246
And they'll kill him?

34:27.382 --> 34:29.049
If that's what it takes,
they'll kill him.

34:29.083 --> 34:30.550
Yes.

34:30.585 --> 34:31.784
But Carl said

34:31.819 --> 34:33.253
That Aiden is young enough

34:33.286 --> 34:34.454
That if we tell him that ghosts

34:34.489 --> 34:35.487
Never existed, right,

34:35.523 --> 34:37.456
That he just had them
in his imagination,

34:37.491 --> 34:40.292
Then he literally won't see them?

34:40.326 --> 34:43.260
If that's even possible.

34:43.295 --> 34:45.228
If that's something
that we decide we want.

34:45.262 --> 34:47.396
Something we want?

34:47.429 --> 34:49.230
Well...

34:49.264 --> 34:50.563
Would it protect him or not?

34:51.598 --> 34:53.364
Carl thinks so.

34:53.399 --> 34:55.600
Melinda, I know this
is a loaded subject

34:55.634 --> 34:57.005
For you, and I know
that you believe...

34:57.039 --> 34:58.473
Sounds like you've already
made up your mind.

34:58.507 --> 35:00.708
About something that
would protect our son...

35:00.742 --> 35:02.977
Almost like you've been waiting
for it to come to this.

35:03.011 --> 35:05.513
Well, no, not exactly this,
I don't know.

35:05.547 --> 35:07.614
But, honey, Carl has been
warning you for months

35:07.648 --> 35:08.915
That there's danger coming,

35:08.949 --> 35:10.149
That it's closer and
it's getting stronger.

35:10.184 --> 35:12.118
Ghosts make threats all the time.

35:12.152 --> 35:13.685
Honey, these aren't threats,
these are warnings

35:13.720 --> 35:15.888
About our son.
And I think you believe them,

35:15.922 --> 35:17.924
Because you wouldn't be
here having this discussion.

35:17.959 --> 35:19.925
Why don't you just say what you really
want, what you've always wanted?

35:19.960 --> 35:22.293
What's that?

35:22.328 --> 35:25.796
A normal kid. And maybe
even a normal wife.

35:25.831 --> 35:28.131
No, that's not true.
I love him, I love you...

35:28.166 --> 35:30.299
But admit it.
Life would be better.

35:30.333 --> 35:32.633
Easier, right? No.
That's not fair.

35:32.667 --> 35:35.235
Because I am going to have
to stop doing what I do.

35:35.270 --> 35:37.437
I'm going to have to lie
to him about where I go

35:37.471 --> 35:39.238
And who I'm talking
to when he's around.

35:39.272 --> 35:41.640
Honey, I don't know
how it would work.

35:41.674 --> 35:43.542
But if it could, don't you think
we owe it to Aiden to try?

35:43.576 --> 35:45.376
By changing him?

35:45.411 --> 35:47.845
Then who is he?

35:47.879 --> 35:51.815
If we take away this
incredible part of him?

35:51.849 --> 35:54.351
I don't care.

35:54.385 --> 35:58.054
If it would keep my son safe
and alive, I don't care.

35:58.088 --> 35:59.622
You don't mean that.

35:59.656 --> 36:02.057
And you don't know.

36:02.091 --> 36:03.324
You don't know how many nights

36:03.359 --> 36:04.625
That I have stayed
in this house alone

36:04.659 --> 36:07.194
Waiting for you to come home.

36:08.662 --> 36:11.264
You know, knowing that there's
nothing I can do to keep you safe

36:11.298 --> 36:12.998
From a threat that I can't see

36:13.032 --> 36:14.366
Or hear or fight.

36:14.400 --> 36:16.835
But right now, for Aiden,

36:16.869 --> 36:18.302
You're telling me I can?

36:18.337 --> 36:21.104
That there's a choice?

36:21.139 --> 36:25.741
Honestly, what choice you
think I was going to make?

36:32.414 --> 36:35.082
It's Delia.

36:35.116 --> 36:36.183
Hello?

36:36.217 --> 36:38.651
Hey, listen, I just got a call

36:38.685 --> 36:40.286
From the cleaning people
over at my office.

36:40.321 --> 36:42.755
And they said they heard
something coming from your store.

36:42.789 --> 36:44.089
Uh-huh?

36:44.123 --> 36:45.223
Yeah, so they went over

36:45.257 --> 36:47.257
And they peered in,
and it was totally dark.

36:47.291 --> 36:49.686
There were no windows broken,
the alarm was still on,

36:49.721 --> 36:52.553
And so I told them
not to call the cops

36:52.587 --> 36:54.253
Because I was thinking,
you know...

36:54.287 --> 36:56.187
Ghost.

36:56.222 --> 36:57.555
Yeah. And if it is Seth,

36:57.589 --> 36:59.156
You might want to get down there

36:59.190 --> 37:02.025
Before he does some
serious damage.

37:04.328 --> 37:07.631
He already has.

37:13.406 --> 37:15.240
Seth?

37:15.274 --> 37:17.942
Kyle is here,
he wants to talk to you.

37:17.977 --> 37:19.210
He's your brother.

37:19.244 --> 37:21.215
He needs you.

37:21.249 --> 37:23.150
Seth, cut it out, man,

37:23.185 --> 37:25.114
That's enough. Says who?

37:25.149 --> 37:27.015
Says her? Or her?

37:27.049 --> 37:29.014
Look, I know you're angry,

37:29.049 --> 37:30.416
But this isn't the
place for you anymore.

37:30.450 --> 37:31.852
Where's the place for me, Kyle?

37:31.887 --> 37:33.122
Was it the orphanage?

37:33.157 --> 37:34.559
Or maybe it was my funeral,

37:34.593 --> 37:36.028
Where you would have cried your
eyes out if I hadn't been there

37:36.063 --> 37:37.397
Promising that I'd stay with you.

37:37.431 --> 37:40.067
Or maybe those first few
days at mom and dad's house.

37:40.102 --> 37:42.036
Yeah, they were mine, too.

37:42.070 --> 37:44.538
You know they wanted
the both of us, right?

37:44.572 --> 37:45.706
You wouldn't go to sleep

37:45.740 --> 37:48.675
Unless I stayed by your
bed all night long,

37:48.710 --> 37:50.176
And this whole time,
you've got to rest

37:50.211 --> 37:52.711
And I've just been awake
watching over you.

37:52.745 --> 37:56.115
And aren't you tired?

37:56.149 --> 37:58.583
Seth, aren't you tired
of trying to be something

37:58.618 --> 37:59.718
That you're not?

37:59.752 --> 38:01.286
What's that, exactly?

38:01.320 --> 38:03.254
Alive, for me.

38:03.288 --> 38:06.223
I could have been alive for them,
too, if you told them!

38:06.257 --> 38:08.091
They wouldn't have believed me.

38:08.125 --> 38:10.193
I could have showed them, see?

38:10.227 --> 38:12.028
There. I hate you.

38:12.063 --> 38:13.329
I hate you so much!

38:13.364 --> 38:14.964
You just wanted them
all to yourself!

38:14.998 --> 38:16.932
You're so selfish!

38:16.966 --> 38:18.100
Do something,
you guys! Make him stop!

38:18.134 --> 38:20.735
Seth, stop acting like that!

38:20.769 --> 38:22.836
Like a child.

38:22.871 --> 38:25.638
It's what you are.

38:25.673 --> 38:28.508
I mean, this whole time I thought
you had grown up with Kyle.

38:28.542 --> 38:30.176
I did.

38:30.210 --> 38:32.377
We did everything together.

38:32.412 --> 38:34.445
That's just because you
mirrored his image.

38:34.480 --> 38:37.447
The way he walks and talks.

38:37.482 --> 38:39.982
You were 8 when you
died and you're 8 now.

38:40.016 --> 38:41.817
You just wanted your mom.

38:54.398 --> 38:56.065
Seth?

39:00.002 --> 39:02.036
And you took her!

39:02.070 --> 39:04.203
And now Gale's taking Kyle.

39:04.238 --> 39:07.205
That's how this all started.

39:07.240 --> 39:08.506
The angry presence she felt,

39:08.541 --> 39:10.540
The haunting in the store,
the words that you wrote,

39:10.575 --> 39:11.708
"over my dead body."

39:11.742 --> 39:13.944
That wasn't a trick on me.

39:13.978 --> 39:15.680
That's how you really felt.

39:15.714 --> 39:19.516
He never should have told her,
I've been here this whole time.

39:19.551 --> 39:22.586
What was I going to say?

39:22.621 --> 39:24.821
We promised each other
we'd always be together

39:24.856 --> 39:26.489
No matter what?

39:26.524 --> 39:28.158
Seth, we were just kids.

39:28.192 --> 39:30.027
We had no idea what could happen.

39:30.061 --> 39:31.328
We didn't know that you'd die.

39:31.362 --> 39:33.930
Well, I kept my promise.
You needed me to.

39:33.964 --> 39:35.665
I took care of you.

39:35.699 --> 39:39.735
Yeah, you did, and now it's
my turn to take care of you.

39:39.769 --> 39:42.003
Seth, please.

39:42.038 --> 39:44.472
I promise you,
it's going to be better.

39:44.506 --> 39:47.241
You remember when mom and dad,

39:47.275 --> 39:49.076
They took me away from that place.

39:49.110 --> 39:50.977
That's what you said to me,
and you were right.

39:51.979 --> 39:54.447
Are you afraid to be on your own?

39:54.481 --> 39:57.116
You used to be really afraid.

39:57.150 --> 39:59.385
Not anymore.

39:59.419 --> 40:00.385
Are you?

40:00.420 --> 40:03.020
No. The light.

40:03.055 --> 40:05.423
It's really nice.

40:05.457 --> 40:06.590
I saw it before,

40:06.624 --> 40:09.625
It's just, you were so sad.

40:09.659 --> 40:12.660
Well, I think I can be happy now.

40:18.697 --> 40:21.097
I think mom is, too.

40:21.132 --> 40:22.565
Do you see her?

40:22.600 --> 40:24.267
No, buddy.

40:24.301 --> 40:26.002
Just you.

40:26.036 --> 40:28.237
She's waiting for me.

40:28.271 --> 40:29.671
Will she still wait,

40:29.705 --> 40:31.239
Just for a second?

40:31.274 --> 40:34.676
Because I think she'd
want me to apologize.

40:34.710 --> 40:36.544
So...

40:37.746 --> 40:40.647
I'm sorry I was mean to you.

40:40.681 --> 40:43.850
It's OK. But it
wasn't all my fault.

40:43.884 --> 40:46.922
Don't worry, I'm not mad
at your brother, either.

40:46.956 --> 40:48.191
No, not him.

40:48.226 --> 40:50.732
It was that guy,
the one who knows you.

40:50.766 --> 40:53.268
He's the one who said I
should be angry at you.

40:53.302 --> 40:55.703
That you take people.

40:55.738 --> 40:58.506
That you took mom before
she could even see me.

40:58.540 --> 41:01.441
Who are you talking about?

41:01.476 --> 41:03.976
He had glasses and white hair.

41:04.011 --> 41:06.445
You know, the guy who's so
nervous and scared all the time.

41:06.480 --> 41:10.583
I guess 'cause those cold
things are always around him.

41:10.617 --> 41:12.684
His name's Bedford.

41:12.718 --> 41:15.519
I think so, yeah.

41:17.722 --> 41:19.656
Those cold things,
they force him to do things.

41:19.690 --> 41:21.124
Did you know that?

41:21.158 --> 41:22.425
No.

41:22.459 --> 41:25.099
Do you feel the cold things, too?

41:25.133 --> 41:27.469
Only when I was around you,

41:27.503 --> 41:30.006
And your son.

41:30.040 --> 41:33.142
Are you going to be OK?

41:35.178 --> 41:37.812
Do you still the light?

41:40.215 --> 41:42.083
Then don't be worried.

41:42.118 --> 41:46.119
It's a grown-up's job to
take care of their family.

42:04.502 --> 42:05.969
He's gone.

42:06.003 --> 42:08.471
My brother's gone.

42:16.800 --> 42:18.867
So the whole thing...

42:18.902 --> 42:21.336
The hauntings, the trick,

42:21.370 --> 42:23.570
The strange visions...

42:23.605 --> 42:27.200
Even what happened to Aiden,
the shadows did it all?

42:27.234 --> 42:29.668
Yeah.

42:29.703 --> 42:32.938
They used Bedford to rile
up that 8-year-old ghost.

42:32.972 --> 42:35.040
And Ned can't find anything
in the book to help you

42:35.074 --> 42:36.808
And Carl has no idea

42:36.842 --> 42:39.010
How to stop these things.

42:39.044 --> 42:41.145
No.

42:44.015 --> 42:45.548
And you still want to tell me

42:45.583 --> 42:47.650
You think Aiden's better
off having this gift

42:47.684 --> 42:50.652
Even though it makes him a target?

43:12.172 --> 43:14.439
I really want to believe
that he's better off

43:14.473 --> 43:17.074
Just being who he is.

43:18.143 --> 43:21.278
I really do, but I can't.

43:23.214 --> 43:25.848
I just can't anymore.

43:29.986 --> 43:32.421
All right. Come here.
