WEBVTT

00:01.387 --> 00:04.043
<i>Previously on Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:04.043 --> 00:06.145
Robyn, you're joining
the blue team.

00:06.146 --> 00:08.547
Chef Ramsay
gave Robyn a new team.

00:08.548 --> 00:09.882
We're gonna kick some ass.

00:09.883 --> 00:11.651
I belong on the blue team.

00:11.652 --> 00:13.352
And the
women were overjoyed.

00:13.353 --> 00:14.520
Yes.

00:14.521 --> 00:16.489
Robyn's gone.
I am doing cartwheels.

00:16.490 --> 00:18.157
In the craps challenge...

00:18.158 --> 00:19.825
You will roll the dice

00:19.826 --> 00:22.161
and choose an ingredient
beginning with that letter.

00:22.162 --> 00:24.030
The blue team
made some unusual choices.

00:24.031 --> 00:25.798
Daikon.
Dragon fruit?

00:25.799 --> 00:27.333
Edamame.

00:27.334 --> 00:30.202
Blue team...
Good luck.

00:30.203 --> 00:32.137
In the red kitchen,

00:32.139 --> 00:34.173
Dana tried to take control
of her team's dish...

00:34.174 --> 00:36.342
You gotta start slicing
the meat, Barbie.

00:36.343 --> 00:38.277
But would not
take advice from anyone.

00:38.278 --> 00:39.745
Does anyone else wanna
taste a brussels sprout?

00:39.746 --> 00:40.980
Chef will hate it.
What?

00:40.981 --> 00:42.214
Chef will hate
those crispy leaves.

00:42.215 --> 00:44.083
They're my favorite ones.

00:44.084 --> 00:45.885
And it proved costly.

00:45.886 --> 00:47.486
Sprouts.
Let down.

00:47.487 --> 00:49.355
What a dumbass.

00:49.356 --> 00:50.856
<i>Congratulations, blue team.</i>

00:52.859 --> 00:54.927
At dinner service,

00:54.928 --> 00:57.697
the chefs hosted American Idols
Lee DeWyze and Haley Reinhart

00:57.698 --> 01:00.666
and international soccer
superstar David Beckham.

01:00.667 --> 01:04.269
David Beckham has arrived.
He is a magical creature.

01:04.271 --> 01:07.206
Which inspired the red
team to their best performance yet.

01:07.207 --> 01:08.641
<i>You got it?
Yeah, man!</i>

01:08.642 --> 01:09.942
I'm good, I'm good.
All right.

01:09.943 --> 01:11.043
Coming down.
It's really good.

01:11.044 --> 01:13.145
David Beckham liked
my pork chop.

01:13.146 --> 01:15.281
That ladies... that's one of
the best services you've ever had.

01:15.282 --> 01:17.083
Thanks, chef.

01:17.084 --> 01:18.384
And it was a
completely different story

01:18.385 --> 01:19.518
in the blue kitchen.

01:19.519 --> 01:21.320
It's not working.
Get it out.

01:21.321 --> 01:23.622
Clemenza couldn't
figure out the scallops.

01:23.623 --> 01:25.758
<i>Clemenza, there's still
water in there, look.</i>

01:25.759 --> 01:28.027
And Royce couldn't
figure out his timing.

01:28.028 --> 01:29.729
<i>Royce! How long?</i>

01:29.730 --> 01:31.831
Five minutes, chef.
Still five minutes!

01:31.832 --> 01:34.333
But chef Ramsay
figured out exactly what to do.

01:34.334 --> 01:36.435
<i>Ladies, come with
the blue team, let's go.</i>

01:36.436 --> 01:37.770
We'll double up
on the stations.

01:37.771 --> 01:39.071
<i>Let's go!</i>

01:39.072 --> 01:40.873
The blue team are pathetic.

01:40.874 --> 01:42.775
And Tiffany
gave more attitude...

01:42.776 --> 01:43.909
Stop, stop!
'Cause you know what?

01:43.910 --> 01:45.144
<i>This is why you guys
get up.</i>

01:45.145 --> 01:46.712
Concentrate and talk
about the order.

01:46.713 --> 01:48.380
...Than help.

01:48.381 --> 01:49.915
It took everything
that I have inside me

01:49.916 --> 01:53.252
not to shove her head
into the fryer.

01:53.253 --> 01:55.187
How do I say this?

01:55.188 --> 01:57.356
The red team blue you away.

01:57.357 --> 01:58.991
The blue nominated...

01:58.992 --> 02:00.226
Royce.
And...

02:00.227 --> 02:01.761
<i>Clemenza.
Clemenza.</i>

02:01.762 --> 02:03.796
Yes, chef,
'cause of his scallops.

02:03.797 --> 02:05.331
But in
the end, it was...

02:05.332 --> 02:06.799
Royce.

02:06.800 --> 02:08.934
Who gave up
his jacket and his dream

02:08.935 --> 02:10.603
of becoming head chef
at Gordon Ramsay Steak

02:10.604 --> 02:13.172
at Paris, Las Vegas.

03:17.070 --> 03:19.705
Good night.
Good night, chef.

03:19.706 --> 03:21.440
<i>Clemenza.
Yes, chef.</i>

03:21.441 --> 03:24.176
This jacket's
like a tipi.

03:24.177 --> 03:25.978
Get out of here.

03:25.979 --> 03:29.582
Could sail across the Atlantic
with this thing.

03:29.583 --> 03:31.016
Clemenza...

03:32.719 --> 03:36.755
I do not feel safe.
I don't wanna go home.

03:36.756 --> 03:38.858
We're down to four.

03:38.859 --> 03:40.826
I need someone in my corner
as quick as possible.

03:40.827 --> 03:44.563
<i>Clemenza, sit next to me.</i>

03:48.301 --> 03:49.869
Come on.

03:49.870 --> 03:51.804
Robyn called me out
in front of chef Ramsay.

03:51.805 --> 03:53.239
But you know what?
I'll play your game.

04:00.146 --> 04:01.881
I have no problem kissing ass.

04:01.882 --> 04:04.416
I know Justin and Brian
got a bromance going on.

04:04.417 --> 04:07.586
Great job today, buddy.

04:07.587 --> 04:09.421
Clemenza's the
only one I really trust.

04:11.958 --> 04:13.292
Done.

04:14.961 --> 04:16.795
Let me tell you something.

04:16.796 --> 04:17.829
Everything that everybody's
said and done,

04:17.831 --> 04:19.697
that's right here.

04:19.699 --> 04:21.745
It's gonna take a lot to pull
the wool over my eyes, man.

04:24.137 --> 04:26.272
Something's not right
on the blue team.

04:26.273 --> 04:28.874
When it was for elimination,
and he said to Robyn

04:28.875 --> 04:30.576
"Who would you send home?"

04:30.577 --> 04:32.444
And Robyn goes
"Clemenza."

04:32.445 --> 04:35.314
I'm sure she was doing the
backpedal once she said that.

04:35.315 --> 04:37.516
I don't have to work
in a kitchen with Robyn,

04:37.517 --> 04:40.986
but up in the dorm she still
literally drives me nuts.

04:40.987 --> 04:42.421
She's just under my skin.

04:42.422 --> 04:43.956
Now I gotta find a way
to shake it

04:43.957 --> 04:45.090
<i>'cause I don't...
Who, Robyn?</i>

04:45.091 --> 04:46.558
Yeah.
Like, under my skin bad.

04:46.559 --> 04:48.527
While the wounds are still there

04:48.528 --> 04:50.162
between Robyn
and her former teammates...

04:50.163 --> 04:52.197
Brian, move your feet, bro.

04:52.198 --> 04:53.632
Outside, Tiffany...

04:53.633 --> 04:55.367
Brian, Brian, Brian.

04:55.368 --> 04:56.969
Tiffany.

04:56.970 --> 04:58.771
Is hoping to
bury the hatchet with Brian.

04:58.772 --> 05:00.239
What do you wanna say?

05:00.240 --> 05:01.874
You came over
and you belittled me.

05:01.875 --> 05:03.642
You're not counting orders.

05:03.643 --> 05:05.311
Listen, you're really gonna
argue with him right now?

05:05.312 --> 05:06.979
I'm helping.
I'm trying to help him.

05:06.980 --> 05:08.514
During service, Tiffany
took over the station.

05:08.515 --> 05:10.716
That stung.

05:10.717 --> 05:12.484
Here's how you treated me,
okay?

05:12.485 --> 05:14.219
You're here, I'm here.

05:14.220 --> 05:15.254
Ba-ba-ba-ba.

05:15.255 --> 05:17.323
Don't do that.

05:17.324 --> 05:19.692
I don't know what their deal is,
but they have this, like,

05:19.693 --> 05:22.628
"oh, wah, wah, my personal
feelings are hurt now."

05:22.629 --> 05:23.963
Just shut up.

05:23.964 --> 05:25.764
It's not about you
in this competition.

05:25.765 --> 05:26.899
It's about the customer
and the food.

05:26.900 --> 05:28.467
<i>Do you realize that?</i>

05:28.468 --> 05:31.070
Tiffany's a bitch.
She sucks.

05:31.071 --> 05:34.073
It's cruel and unusual
punishment...

05:34.074 --> 05:36.442
To have to look at her.
I'm done with her.

05:36.443 --> 05:38.777
You had no right
to come over there

05:38.778 --> 05:41.080
and talk to me
like a two-year-old.

05:41.081 --> 05:43.415
Do you understand that?

05:43.416 --> 05:45.117
Give me a break.

05:45.118 --> 05:46.986
We didn't come over
to your station and be like

05:46.987 --> 05:48.020
"get the
out of the way.

05:48.021 --> 05:49.154
That's why you're losing."

05:49.155 --> 05:50.389
I'm not talking to you
right now.

05:50.390 --> 05:52.858
I don't really give a .

05:52.859 --> 05:54.360
Are you kidding me?

05:54.361 --> 05:56.628
She's out of her mind.

05:56.629 --> 05:59.064
Clearly, life in
Hell's Kitchen is more intense,

05:59.065 --> 06:01.800
and friendships are crumbling.

06:03.136 --> 06:05.838
And as the sun rises
on a new day...

06:05.839 --> 06:07.406
Let's do this.

06:07.407 --> 06:09.241
The chefs are
more anxious than ever.

06:09.242 --> 06:11.410
There ain't no hiding now.

06:11.411 --> 06:14.313
But chef Ramsay has an
idea on how to break the tension.

06:14.314 --> 06:16.515
Good morning.
Good morning, chef!

06:16.516 --> 06:20.719
Today, I thought we would have
a little fun.

06:20.720 --> 06:22.254
Oh, .

06:22.255 --> 06:26.392
I'm gonna challenge you
to a wing-eating competition.

06:26.393 --> 06:27.393
Oh.

06:27.394 --> 06:29.561
Yeah!

06:29.562 --> 06:33.665
I need two volunteers
from each team.

06:33.666 --> 06:35.901
<i>Red team, Bobby and Tiffany.</i>

06:35.902 --> 06:36.935
<i>Blue team...</i>

06:36.936 --> 06:38.303
I can eat.

06:38.304 --> 06:40.639
I might be a little guy,
but I am mighty mouse.

06:40.640 --> 06:44.209
Brian and Justin.

06:44.210 --> 06:46.311
<i>Justin, why do you look
so miserable?</i>

06:46.312 --> 06:48.414
I can't eat fast.
I choke on my food.

06:48.415 --> 06:49.915
Where the hell
am I gonna throw up?

06:49.916 --> 06:52.251
Let's go.
Take a seat.

06:52.252 --> 06:54.686
<i>Mm. Nice.
Let's go.</i>

06:54.687 --> 06:56.789
<i>Come on, put your bib on,
please.</i>

06:56.790 --> 06:58.390
You wanna have a wing-eating
competition?

06:58.391 --> 07:00.092
Let's go, bro.
Bring it.

07:00.093 --> 07:02.294
I think I can eat more wings
than you any day.

07:02.295 --> 07:04.696
On your marks...

07:04.697 --> 07:07.800
<i>Get set...</i>

07:07.801 --> 07:09.101
<i>Go!</i>

07:09.102 --> 07:11.103
Stop, stop, stop!

07:11.104 --> 07:12.604
<i>Seriously?</i>

07:12.605 --> 07:15.874
Do you honestly think
that I was gonna take you on

07:15.875 --> 07:17.242
in a chicken wing contest?

07:17.243 --> 07:18.911
Come on!

07:18.912 --> 07:24.450
<i>Let me tell you who you will be
competing against this morning.</i>

07:24.451 --> 07:28.253
He's the world
champion competitive eater

07:28.254 --> 07:32.157
Joey "Jaws" Chestnut!

07:34.694 --> 07:37.162
<i>Wow! There's the belt.
Joey, good morning, sir.</i>

07:37.163 --> 07:38.730
Are you well?
You guys ready?

07:38.731 --> 07:40.132
Good to see you.
Are you good?

07:40.133 --> 07:41.800
Oh, I'm feeling great.

07:41.801 --> 07:44.069
I have no chance in hell, dude.
I've seen this guy eat.

07:44.070 --> 07:45.637
I watch him
every Fourth of July on TV.

07:45.638 --> 07:47.039
This guy's the man.

07:47.040 --> 07:49.174
You four, as a team,

07:49.175 --> 07:55.747
are gonna try and out-eat
the champ.

07:55.748 --> 07:59.718
If Tiffany can eat these wings
as fast as she can drink beers,

07:59.719 --> 08:01.019
we'll be good.

08:01.020 --> 08:05.491
Whoever can finish...
the 60 wings first,

08:05.492 --> 08:09.328
wins $500.

08:09.329 --> 08:12.197
Ooh! I can eat now!

08:12.198 --> 08:13.398
I'll puke.

08:13.399 --> 08:14.800
I got it.
I'll just eat 'em all.

08:14.801 --> 08:16.635
On your mark, get set, go!

08:16.636 --> 08:17.736
<i>Good luck!</i>

08:18.771 --> 08:20.239
Guys, come on.

08:20.240 --> 08:21.974
Come on, Tiff!

08:21.975 --> 08:23.675
<i>You gotta suck it down!</i>

08:23.676 --> 08:25.677
<i>Just pull it off.
He's killing y'all, dude.</i>

08:25.678 --> 08:27.579
<i>Go, just! Come on, come on!</i>

08:27.580 --> 08:28.380
<i>Stick the whole thing
in your mouth.</i>

08:28.381 --> 08:29.648
Come on, Bri!

08:29.649 --> 08:31.950
Pull the whole thing off!
Just pull it off.

08:31.951 --> 08:33.118
<i>Come on, girl!</i>

08:33.119 --> 08:34.453
<i>Come on, Justin!</i>

08:34.453 --> 08:35.287
<i>You gotta pull the meat off.</i>

08:35.288 --> 08:36.421
I wanna hurl.

08:36.422 --> 08:37.923
<i>Come on, Tiffany.</i>

08:37.924 --> 08:39.024
Sorry, chef.

08:39.025 --> 08:40.392
It's, like, too much.

08:40.393 --> 08:41.493
I don't even want it
in my mouth.

08:41.494 --> 08:42.361
It's like...Blah.

08:42.361 --> 08:43.761
Break the bone!

08:43.763 --> 08:45.497
<i>Get in there, Tiff.
You're doing good.</i>

08:45.498 --> 08:47.065
<i>Keep chewing, keep chewing.</i>

08:48.635 --> 08:49.935
Come on, Joey.

08:49.936 --> 08:51.436
<i>Come on, Tiff.</i>

08:51.437 --> 08:53.572
All right, there's $500
on the line right now.

08:53.573 --> 08:55.807
I don't care what happens.
I'm attacking those wings.

08:55.808 --> 08:57.276
Come on, ladies!

08:57.277 --> 08:59.211
Come on, just, come on!

08:59.212 --> 09:02.281
Joey has only four left.
Come on.

09:02.282 --> 09:06.552
Bring it on, Chestnut.

09:06.553 --> 09:07.786
Go, go, go, go!

09:07.787 --> 09:10.255
Come on, Brian!

09:15.345 --> 09:17.212
This morning, in an attempt

09:17.213 --> 09:18.513
to break the tension
in Hell's Kitchen,

09:18.514 --> 09:20.449
chef Ramsay surprised the chefs

09:20.450 --> 09:22.251
with a wing-eating contest.

09:22.252 --> 09:25.554
Champion competitive eater
Joey Chestnut is taking on

09:25.555 --> 09:27.990
four of the chefs,
and the winner...

09:27.991 --> 09:33.061
Wins $500.

09:33.062 --> 09:35.197
Joey has only four left!

09:35.198 --> 09:36.765
Go, go, go, go!

09:36.766 --> 09:37.900
<i>Last one, Joey!</i>

09:37.901 --> 09:39.301
<i>Come on, Barbie!</i>

09:39.302 --> 09:40.836
<i>Finish up, b!</i>

09:40.837 --> 09:42.404
<i>Come on, come
on, don't give up!</i>

09:42.405 --> 09:44.139
<i>Well done, Joey.</i>

09:44.140 --> 09:45.874
<i>Well done.</i>

09:45.875 --> 09:47.442
Check, check, check.

09:47.443 --> 09:48.510
Thank you, sir.

09:48.511 --> 09:50.178
<i>Well done.</i>

09:50.179 --> 09:51.580
Let's hear it
for the world champion

09:51.581 --> 09:52.748
Joey "Jaws" Chestnut.

09:52.749 --> 09:54.383
<i>Yeah, good job.
Good job, man.</i>

09:54.384 --> 09:55.517
<i>Good job, Joey.</i>

09:55.518 --> 09:57.319
I have to commend the champion.

09:57.320 --> 09:58.720
That is impressive.

09:58.721 --> 10:00.355
Good work, yes?
Thanks for coming, bud.

10:00.356 --> 10:02.257
<i>Okay, chefs, put your bibs down</i>

10:02.258 --> 10:04.893
and get back in line, please.
Let's go.

10:04.894 --> 10:07.696
Oh, God.

10:07.697 --> 10:08.964
I'm not feeling well.

10:08.965 --> 10:10.332
Okay.

10:10.333 --> 10:12.968
Some of you clearly
have had your stomachs tested.

10:12.969 --> 10:16.505
<i>Now it's time
for the real test.</i>

10:16.506 --> 10:18.206
<i>It's a test of your palates.</i>

10:18.207 --> 10:23.211
It's time for the blind
taste test.

10:25.281 --> 10:26.782
Are you serious?

10:26.783 --> 10:30.319
My lips are numb and burning
at the same time.

10:30.320 --> 10:32.721
Red team, you have
an extra player in your team.

10:32.722 --> 10:35.390
Decide amongst yourselves
who's sitting out.

10:35.391 --> 10:38.193
I'll sit out because
I smoked this morning.

10:38.194 --> 10:42.331
Everyone standing here have all
smoked cigarettes this morning.

10:42.332 --> 10:44.499
I guess Kimmie wants to watch
other people compete.

10:44.500 --> 10:45.600
Who's sitting out?

10:45.601 --> 10:48.236
I'm sitting out.

10:48.237 --> 10:50.038
Kimmie decided to volunteer
to sit out... Again.

10:50.039 --> 10:52.107
She's scared.

10:52.108 --> 10:54.443
<i>Okay, first up...</i>

10:54.444 --> 10:59.448
Christina... versus Brian.
Let's go.

10:59.449 --> 11:01.717
I've actually trained for this.

11:01.718 --> 11:03.852
But I didn't expect to have

11:03.853 --> 11:06.288
a pound and a half of wings
in my stomach

11:06.289 --> 11:08.256
and all over my face
and my teeth at the same time.

11:08.257 --> 11:10.993
Blindfolds on first.
Thank you.

11:10.994 --> 11:13.528
Chef Ramsay
loves the blind taste test

11:13.529 --> 11:15.430
because it gives him
a very good indication

11:15.431 --> 11:17.299
which of the chefs have
a superior palate.

11:17.300 --> 11:19.401
<i>Good.
Headsets on.</i>

11:19.402 --> 11:21.203
It is the one challenge
that has been in every season

11:21.204 --> 11:22.471
<i>of Hell's Kitchen.</i>

11:22.472 --> 11:24.206
Brian, can you hear me?

11:24.207 --> 11:26.341
<i>Christina, can you hear me?</i>

11:26.342 --> 11:28.777
And not once has any
chef achieved a perfect score.

11:28.778 --> 11:30.645
Let's get started.

11:30.646 --> 11:33.148
Now one chef from
each team will go head to head

11:33.149 --> 11:36.084
in an attempt to identify
four different foods.

11:36.085 --> 11:37.185
First up...

11:37.186 --> 11:40.055
Beet.

11:46.596 --> 11:47.996
Beets.

11:47.997 --> 11:49.698
Correct.

11:49.699 --> 11:50.799
Come on, Christina.

11:50.800 --> 11:52.267
Beets.

11:52.268 --> 11:53.835
Well done.

11:53.836 --> 11:55.837
1-1.

11:55.838 --> 11:57.973
Shallot.

12:05.114 --> 12:06.415
Onion.

12:06.416 --> 12:09.184
Onion.
Wrong, shallot.

12:09.185 --> 12:10.652
Oh.

12:11.821 --> 12:12.954
Onion.

12:14.457 --> 12:16.591
Wrong.
Shallot.

12:16.592 --> 12:19.061
I literally talked myself
out of saying shallot.

12:19.062 --> 12:20.462
That was a tough one.

12:20.463 --> 12:21.696
Let's make it
a little bit easier.

12:21.697 --> 12:23.465
This is turkey.

12:28.504 --> 12:29.604
<i>Come on.</i>

12:29.605 --> 12:31.039
Very dry turkey.

12:32.375 --> 12:33.975
You gotta love Brian.
You gotta just love him.

12:35.645 --> 12:36.678
Tofu.

12:36.679 --> 12:39.781
Tofu.

12:39.782 --> 12:44.953
Tofu... is creamy and smooth.

12:44.954 --> 12:46.054
I know.
turkey.

12:46.055 --> 12:48.290
Yeah.

12:48.291 --> 12:50.158
Dur.
Okay.

12:50.159 --> 12:52.928
Pineapple.

12:52.929 --> 12:55.764
Something to refresh
the palate.

12:55.765 --> 12:58.133
Mm.
Come on.

13:00.069 --> 13:03.071
Pineapple, chef.

13:03.072 --> 13:04.639
Well done.

13:04.640 --> 13:07.909
Pineapple.

13:07.910 --> 13:09.478
Well done.
Headset off.

13:09.479 --> 13:10.512
<i>Well done, well done.</i>

13:10.513 --> 13:11.847
We good?

13:11.848 --> 13:14.216
<i>Good job, Christina!
Sorry about that, guys.</i>

13:14.217 --> 13:15.450
<i>Christina, tofu?</i>

13:15.451 --> 13:17.152
that turkey.

13:17.153 --> 13:19.387
Great start.
Well done, both of you.

13:19.388 --> 13:22.390
I know three for four is
a strong, strong performance.

13:22.391 --> 13:24.292
I get the team off to
a very good start.

13:24.293 --> 13:27.195
Next up,
Barbie and Robyn... let's go!

13:27.196 --> 13:28.763
Come on, Robyn.
Come on, Robyn.

13:28.764 --> 13:30.499
I love competing
against Barbie.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.834
I wanna see when just falls
flat on her face.

13:32.835 --> 13:34.669
I think it's fun.

13:34.670 --> 13:35.904
Grits.

13:42.912 --> 13:45.013
Rice.

13:45.014 --> 13:48.583
Cauliflower?

13:48.584 --> 13:51.586
How do you get cauliflower
from grits?

13:51.587 --> 13:53.722
Grits are so unique.

13:53.723 --> 13:56.958
I am kicking myself right now
because I sat out.

13:56.959 --> 13:58.693
Still three to two.

13:58.694 --> 14:01.763
After missing the first point,
both chefs stumble on turnips...

14:01.764 --> 14:02.797
Pear?

14:02.798 --> 14:04.032
Carrot?

14:04.033 --> 14:05.133
And sea bass.

14:05.134 --> 14:06.434
Halibut?

14:06.435 --> 14:07.969
Halibut.
Damn.

14:07.970 --> 14:09.604
Crab?

14:09.605 --> 14:11.973
<i>Crab? Still three to two.</i>

14:11.974 --> 14:13.642
But the both have one
more chance for a point with...

14:13.643 --> 14:14.809
Cilantro.

14:14.810 --> 14:16.411
<i>We gotta get this one.</i>

14:16.412 --> 14:17.179
<i>Yeah, Barbie.
Come on, Barbie.</i>

14:17.180 --> 14:18.013
Come on, Barbie.

14:18.014 --> 14:19.814
Let's go party.

14:19.815 --> 14:22.284
<i>Taste and smell.
You can smell that.</i>

14:22.285 --> 14:23.718
Cilantro? Come on.

14:23.719 --> 14:25.453
There's no way anybody
can get this wrong.

14:25.454 --> 14:26.588
You pretty much smell it
from a mile away.

14:29.091 --> 14:30.225
Tarragon.

14:30.226 --> 14:31.726
Tarragon.

14:31.727 --> 14:33.862
What the hell are
you talking about?

14:33.863 --> 14:35.096
<i>Come on, Barbie.</i>

14:35.097 --> 14:36.131
Wow.

14:36.132 --> 14:40.035
Cilantro.

14:40.036 --> 14:41.536
Cilantro.

14:41.537 --> 14:44.906
That's cilantro?

14:44.907 --> 14:48.243
Robyn gets a big fat zero!

14:48.244 --> 14:50.679
Damn, my taste buds are off.

14:50.680 --> 14:53.048
Ah-ha!
Ha ha ha!

14:53.049 --> 14:54.349
Barbie, grits?

14:54.350 --> 14:56.518
Don't taste like the grits
I make at home.

14:56.519 --> 14:58.386
Despite Barbie
getting only one point,

14:58.387 --> 15:00.088
it was an important one.

15:00.089 --> 15:02.257
We're all tied up.
3-3.

15:02.258 --> 15:05.427
Now Clemenza and Tiffany
are each hoping to take the lead

15:05.428 --> 15:06.528
for their team.

15:06.529 --> 15:08.630
Come on, Tiff!
Come on, Tiff!

15:08.631 --> 15:10.432
Lamb.
Open.

15:10.433 --> 15:13.068
Oh, look at the state of that.

15:17.607 --> 15:20.709
<i>Tiffany, you know this.
You know this, Tiff.</i>

15:20.710 --> 15:21.743
<i>Come on, Clemenza.</i>

15:21.744 --> 15:23.612
Chicken.

15:23.613 --> 15:25.513
Chicken.

15:25.514 --> 15:26.615
<i>Lamb!</i>

15:26.616 --> 15:28.016
Really?

15:28.017 --> 15:29.251
Lamb.

15:29.252 --> 15:30.252
Lamb?

15:32.622 --> 15:34.155
Sweet potato.

15:34.156 --> 15:35.690
<i>You know what that is.</i>

15:35.691 --> 15:37.759
<i>So delicious.
Come on, Tiff!</i>

15:37.760 --> 15:39.527
<i>Sweet potato.</i>

15:39.528 --> 15:40.895
<i>So delicious.
You're so happy.</i>

15:40.896 --> 15:42.130
<i>So happy.</i>

15:42.131 --> 15:43.198
Carrot.

15:43.199 --> 15:44.199
<i>Carrot?</i>

15:44.200 --> 15:46.001
Mango.

15:46.002 --> 15:47.669
<i>Not even close.</i>

15:47.670 --> 15:50.639
Eggplant.

15:55.478 --> 15:58.346
This is a shoo-in
for Clemenza, come on.

15:58.347 --> 16:00.081
He eats eggplant all the time.
He's Italian.

16:00.082 --> 16:01.416
Give me a break.

16:01.417 --> 16:03.285
You cook it every day.
Take a guess!

16:03.286 --> 16:04.352
<i>Come on, Clemenza.</i>

16:04.353 --> 16:05.553
I have no idea.

16:05.554 --> 16:07.155
Say something!

16:07.156 --> 16:09.224
Turnips.
I don't know.

16:09.225 --> 16:12.027
Umm...

16:13.829 --> 16:15.530
Um, I don't even know.

16:15.531 --> 16:16.998
It tastes like soggy diaper.
How about that?

16:16.999 --> 16:19.200
That's my answer.

16:19.201 --> 16:21.269
Green bean.

16:21.270 --> 16:22.904
<i>Green beans.</i>

16:22.905 --> 16:25.106
Eggplant.
Really?

16:25.107 --> 16:28.009
Eggplant.
Eggplant?

16:28.010 --> 16:31.012
Okay, let's make it
even simpler.

16:31.013 --> 16:32.747
Walnuts.

16:35.351 --> 16:38.186
<i>There you go, there you go.</i>

16:38.187 --> 16:39.487
Peanuts?

16:39.488 --> 16:40.889
<i>Peanuts?</i>

16:40.890 --> 16:42.223
It's a nut.

16:42.224 --> 16:44.326
Come on, Tiff.
Come on, let's get it, Tiff.

16:44.327 --> 16:46.728
One more point and we're ahead.

16:47.863 --> 16:49.798
Walnut, Walnut!

16:52.635 --> 16:54.969
Okay, that's four for the red.
Three for the blue.

16:54.970 --> 16:56.905
The red team
is ahead by just one point

16:56.906 --> 16:58.940
going into the final round
of the blind taste test.

16:58.941 --> 17:01.843
It all comes down
to the last pair.

17:01.844 --> 17:03.912
<i>Dana and Justin, let's go!</i>

17:03.913 --> 17:05.914
And the first
ingredient will be something

17:05.915 --> 17:08.049
these chefs have cooked
in every dinner service.

17:08.050 --> 17:09.818
Scallop.

17:09.819 --> 17:11.019
<i>All right.
Come on, Dana.</i>

17:11.020 --> 17:13.421
<i>You got this.</i>

17:14.522 --> 17:15.890
<i>Come on, Dana.</i>

17:15.891 --> 17:17.959
<i>Come on, just.
You got it, bro.</i>

17:17.960 --> 17:19.027
Scallop.

17:19.028 --> 17:20.362
Yes!

17:20.363 --> 17:22.364
<i>Good job. Scallop.
Well done.</i>

17:23.398 --> 17:26.734
Tofu.

17:26.736 --> 17:28.403
Scallop.
Oh, .

17:28.404 --> 17:29.671
No!

17:29.672 --> 17:33.675
We got a tie.
4-4.

17:33.676 --> 17:36.978
Beautiful.
Fig.

17:36.979 --> 17:39.047
Mm.

17:40.549 --> 17:42.417
Come on, Dana.

17:43.719 --> 17:46.454
Perhaps a fig, chef.

17:46.455 --> 17:47.522
Fig.

17:47.523 --> 17:48.656
<i>Yeah!</i>

17:48.657 --> 17:51.659
5-5.

17:51.660 --> 17:54.062
Red team needs this win
so much.

17:54.063 --> 17:56.731
We have to win.

17:56.732 --> 17:58.233
Radish.

18:01.504 --> 18:03.204
<i>Come on, Dana.
Come on.</i>

18:03.205 --> 18:05.640
<i>Come on, Dana.</i>

18:06.742 --> 18:09.310
Radish, chef.
Yes!

18:09.311 --> 18:10.512
Radish.

18:10.513 --> 18:11.980
Yeah, there you go.

18:11.981 --> 18:14.315
<i>Wow! 6-6.</i>

18:14.316 --> 18:16.651
A little close to the menu.

18:16.652 --> 18:19.120
Sunchoke.

18:19.121 --> 18:21.556
In our Risotto.

18:28.364 --> 18:30.598
<i>Come on, Dana.</i>

18:31.600 --> 18:32.767
Carrot.

18:32.768 --> 18:35.437
A carrot?

18:35.438 --> 18:38.139
Justin gets this right,
it's over.

18:38.140 --> 18:39.707
Come on.

18:39.708 --> 18:42.010
<i>Justin, let's go.</i>

18:48.954 --> 18:51.389
It's the final
round of the blind taste test

18:51.390 --> 18:54.191
and the teams are tied
with six points each.

18:54.192 --> 18:55.292
Dana...
Carrot?

18:56.762 --> 18:58.496
Was unable
to identify the...

18:58.497 --> 18:59.764
Sunchoke.

18:59.765 --> 19:01.532
If Justin gets this point,

19:01.533 --> 19:03.100
he will win the challenge
for his team

19:03.101 --> 19:05.603
and achieve something
no other chef has

19:05.604 --> 19:07.872
<i>in the history
of Hell's Kitchen...</i>

19:07.873 --> 19:09.507
a perfect score.

19:09.508 --> 19:11.375
Sunchoke.

19:11.376 --> 19:12.743
Yeah!

19:12.744 --> 19:14.478
Justin, four for four.

19:14.479 --> 19:16.147
Yes, dude, we won!

19:18.817 --> 19:21.052
You have an extraordinary
palate.

19:21.053 --> 19:24.321
<i>Never before has anyone
gotten a perfect score.</i>

19:24.322 --> 19:26.590
Justin... four for four!

19:26.591 --> 19:29.226
That is awesome!
Kudos to you, Justin.

19:29.227 --> 19:32.630
Justin, you even got sunchoke?
Were you cheating?

19:32.631 --> 19:33.898
I think you could hear.

19:33.899 --> 19:35.399
Blue team, congratulations.

19:35.400 --> 19:36.434
Thank you very much.
Thank you, chef.

19:36.435 --> 19:37.968
Wow.
Are you in for a treat.

19:37.969 --> 19:40.871
<i>All of you are going
to the most amazing water park.</i>

19:42.808 --> 19:45.643
You've got the entire park
to yourselves.

19:47.546 --> 19:50.848
I am so excited to chill out
in the sun and get a tan...

19:50.849 --> 19:52.183
As Jersey as that is.

19:52.184 --> 19:53.317
Thank you, chef!

19:53.318 --> 19:54.985
<i>Well done!</i>

19:54.986 --> 19:57.755
It sucks so bad to lose.

19:57.756 --> 19:59.790
I'm completely jealous
right now.

19:59.791 --> 20:03.761
Ladies, you are in, sadly, for
the most difficult punishment

20:03.762 --> 20:06.864
<i>in the history
of Hell's Kitchen.</i>

20:06.865 --> 20:09.066
I'm sorry to say
it is delivery day.

20:09.067 --> 20:10.601
me.

20:10.602 --> 20:13.938
Deliveries will be arriving
pretty much nonstop.

20:15.140 --> 20:16.674
<i>You'll be responsible</i>

20:16.675 --> 20:18.509
for restocking both kitchens

20:18.510 --> 20:21.746
and lifting every box
from those trucks.

20:23.715 --> 20:25.182
That means
the truck has arrived.

20:25.183 --> 20:26.484
Get your asses in gear quick.

20:26.485 --> 20:28.452
<i>Yes, chef.
Yes, chef.</i>

20:28.453 --> 20:29.854
Oh, my God.

20:29.855 --> 20:31.622
Third punishment in a row
for the red team.

20:32.858 --> 20:34.658
I don't wanna get
used to this feeling.

20:38.764 --> 20:41.632
You got to be
kidding me!

20:41.633 --> 20:45.503
This is not gonna be
a good day.

20:47.000 --> 20:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here

20:55.580 --> 20:57.014
<i>Come on, Clemenza.</i>

20:57.015 --> 20:59.016
Off to walley world.

20:59.017 --> 21:00.851
What are you doing?

21:00.852 --> 21:02.119
We're building a barricade
so they can't get out.

21:03.922 --> 21:07.158
Like to see 'em get through
that .

21:07.159 --> 21:08.826
Here they come.

21:08.827 --> 21:10.494
<i>How we supposed
to get through here?</i>

21:11.863 --> 21:13.764
What's the problem, guys?
Can't get through?

21:13.765 --> 21:15.099
Wait a minute.

21:15.100 --> 21:17.134
What the
you trying to do?

21:17.135 --> 21:18.836
It was like the great wall
of white out there.

21:18.837 --> 21:20.337
I'll just plow through
this .

21:20.338 --> 21:22.606
<i>Have your
fun in the sun.</i>

21:22.607 --> 21:25.743
<i>All right, give me my speedo.
I'm ready!</i>

21:34.319 --> 21:37.154
Raging waters!
Kick ass!

21:38.223 --> 21:39.356
Whoo!

21:39.357 --> 21:40.925
We can go on any rides we want.

21:40.926 --> 21:42.359
As many times as we want.
No lines.

21:42.360 --> 21:44.328
Who has it better than me
right now? Nobody.

21:44.329 --> 21:46.096
<i>Yeah!</i>

21:46.097 --> 21:47.731
Whoa!

21:47.732 --> 21:49.333
It's beautiful outside.

21:49.334 --> 21:51.135
It's just amazing.
Makes me happy.

21:54.840 --> 21:56.740
I'll get in with you
as long as you hold my hand

21:56.741 --> 21:58.509
and hug me when I'm cold.

21:58.510 --> 22:01.378
Clemenza and I definitely
have been bonding more and more

22:01.379 --> 22:03.180
each challenge win.

22:06.351 --> 22:08.419
While the blue team
is warming up to each other

22:08.420 --> 22:09.920
at the water park...

22:09.921 --> 22:11.422
That would be nice.

22:11.423 --> 22:12.590
The women...

22:12.591 --> 22:14.058
<i>Ice, guys, ice.</i>

22:14.059 --> 22:16.660
Are about to
encounter a cold front.

22:16.661 --> 22:18.963
Oh, We go.

22:18.964 --> 22:20.464
Oh, .

22:20.465 --> 22:22.399
<i>Looks like 50
40-pound bags.</i>

22:22.400 --> 22:24.768
Yeah, this ain't
so fun now, huh?

22:24.769 --> 22:26.637
I'm exhausted before
we even get going

22:26.638 --> 22:29.106
just looking
at the back of that truck.

22:33.211 --> 22:35.479
I need a personal assistant
for this job.

22:35.480 --> 22:38.182
I hate my life
so much right now.

22:38.183 --> 22:42.253
Somebody shoot me.

22:42.254 --> 22:44.989
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me.

22:44.990 --> 22:47.091
My life sucks right now.

22:47.092 --> 22:49.793
Barbie, we need
some help in here.

22:53.131 --> 22:55.032
What the is she doing?

22:55.033 --> 22:57.301
Did she put 'em
outside the truck?

22:57.302 --> 22:58.836
<i>No, she's just taking them
off the pallets</i>

22:58.837 --> 23:00.137
<i>and setting them down.</i>

23:00.138 --> 23:04.008
Like, the easiest job
out of all of this.

23:06.511 --> 23:08.078
Barbie doesn't wanna get
off the truck

23:08.079 --> 23:10.114
to carry anything in.

23:10.115 --> 23:12.116
This stupid bitch.

23:12.117 --> 23:14.585
I've had it.
I had it.

23:14.586 --> 23:16.553
Barbie, come up here
and start loading this .

23:16.554 --> 23:18.422
<i>Get the out
of the truck.</i>

23:18.423 --> 23:19.657
You're not gonna get the easy
every time.

23:19.658 --> 23:21.125
This is easy?

23:21.126 --> 23:23.761
Kimmie might be 6'1"
and 300 pounds,

23:23.762 --> 23:26.230
but, hell no, I'm not afraid
of Kimmie.

23:26.231 --> 23:27.798
Go load that thing.

23:27.799 --> 23:29.500
Don't talk to me
that way.

23:29.501 --> 23:30.234
I'll talk to you
any way I want to.

23:30.235 --> 23:31.902
Stupid bitch.

23:31.903 --> 23:34.538
I'm working harder than you,
been working harder than you.

23:34.539 --> 23:36.307
You crazy, stupid bitch.

23:36.308 --> 23:38.342
<i>You ain't worked harder
than anybody.</i>

23:40.445 --> 23:42.846
How many?
Oh, that's right... none!

23:42.847 --> 23:44.982
<i>My fat ass jogged up here
more than you have!</i>

23:44.983 --> 23:46.984
You ain't never jogged
a day in your life,

23:46.985 --> 23:48.819
and your ass shows it.

23:53.939 --> 23:56.073
After losing
the blind taste test,

23:56.074 --> 23:57.608
the red team must suffer

23:57.609 --> 23:59.243
Hell's Kitchen's
most brutal punishment.

23:59.244 --> 24:01.479
not light.

24:01.480 --> 24:03.815
Delivery day.

24:03.816 --> 24:06.951
It's a day of truly
backbreaking labor.

24:06.952 --> 24:09.420
But instead of working
harmoniously together,

24:09.421 --> 24:10.888
Barbie and Kimmie...

24:10.889 --> 24:13.558
Ooh, I wanna you so bad,
you nasty bitch.

24:13.559 --> 24:15.793
Are at war.

24:15.794 --> 24:18.496
Lazy bitch!

24:18.497 --> 24:20.298
Now we got Barbie
running up stairs.

24:20.299 --> 24:22.066
Good job, good job.

24:22.067 --> 24:23.401
off.

24:23.402 --> 24:25.236
Knock it off!!

24:25.237 --> 24:26.571
Dude, like, shut up.

24:26.572 --> 24:28.406
That truck, dude.
Stop!

24:28.407 --> 24:30.141
Now you're
wasting time for everybody.

24:30.142 --> 24:32.810
If we're gonna expend
a lot of energy today.

24:32.811 --> 24:35.179
I definitely don't need
to do it fighting.

24:43.589 --> 24:44.922
Not bad.

24:44.923 --> 24:47.859
We get to relax in the sun,
but it's boring.

24:47.860 --> 24:50.127
I want a ride
that's poop-your-pants-scary.

24:50.128 --> 24:53.898
Like I-don't-know-if
I'm-making-it-out-alive scary.

24:53.899 --> 24:56.701
<i>Yo, we're gonna hit up
one more slide.</i>

24:56.702 --> 24:58.236
<i>The giant one.</i>

24:58.237 --> 24:59.704
<i>No.
Come on. Why?</i>

24:59.705 --> 25:01.138
<i>No way.
Come on, Clemenza.</i>

25:01.139 --> 25:03.007
Giant one, straight down.
Yeah, you're in.

25:03.008 --> 25:04.308
I haven't done it.
Never will.

25:04.309 --> 25:05.409
Come on.
Why?

25:05.410 --> 25:06.911
That thing freaks me out.

25:06.912 --> 25:08.312
<i>It's fine.
You get over your fear.</i>

25:08.313 --> 25:09.814
Dude, that thing freaks me out!

25:09.815 --> 25:11.649
It literally is
straight down!

25:12.651 --> 25:14.118
Let's go!

25:15.888 --> 25:17.488
Brian's just out of his mind.

25:17.489 --> 25:19.390
We all know Brian's just
umbatz.

25:19.391 --> 25:20.491
He's just crazy.

25:20.492 --> 25:24.528
Yeaaah!

25:41.380 --> 25:42.747
<i>You wanna do it again?</i>

25:42.748 --> 25:44.815
<i>, yeah, dude!</i>

25:44.816 --> 25:50.521
I literally got probably
12 to 13 feet, at least, of air.

25:50.522 --> 25:53.457
Yeaaaah!

25:53.458 --> 25:56.928
<i>Go!</i>

25:56.929 --> 25:59.497
While Brian
has the time of his life,

25:59.498 --> 26:01.332
the red team is feeling
that punishment

26:01.333 --> 26:03.501
couldn't get any worse.

26:03.502 --> 26:05.169
I can't feel my body parts.

26:05.170 --> 26:06.971
I'm trying to keep up the pace.

26:06.972 --> 26:08.673
But they're wrong.

26:08.674 --> 26:10.574
I need you to take
all the peppercorns,

26:10.575 --> 26:12.209
<i>grind them
the mortar and pestle.</i>

26:12.210 --> 26:14.612
I need you to do all of it.

26:14.613 --> 26:16.547
I need you to drain the fryers,

26:16.548 --> 26:18.849
then refill them with
the new fryer oil on both sides.

26:18.850 --> 26:20.117
<i>Okay?</i>

26:20.118 --> 26:22.053
<i>And I need you to take
those potatoes,</i>

26:22.054 --> 26:23.120
I need you to peel 'em
and hold them in cold water

26:23.121 --> 26:25.556
in the refrigerator.

26:25.557 --> 26:29.160
<i>This has been the worst...
I repeat, the worst...</i>

26:29.161 --> 26:32.663
punishment thus far.

26:35.167 --> 26:37.468
This is gonna take forever.

26:37.469 --> 26:41.072
This is definitely the most
not fun task I have ever done.

26:41.073 --> 26:42.139
Oh, it's in my eye.

26:42.140 --> 26:43.941
Oh, .

26:47.646 --> 26:49.780
Are you serious?

26:49.781 --> 26:52.249
Oh, sweat's dripping
on the back of my legs.

26:52.250 --> 26:54.352
<i>My arm hurts.</i>

26:59.725 --> 27:02.660
Hello!

27:08.567 --> 27:10.301
Yeah, that sucks.

27:12.037 --> 27:13.838
Oh, it's nice.

27:13.839 --> 27:16.540
After an exhausting
but fun day for the blue team...

27:16.541 --> 27:18.743
Honestly, I'm tired.

27:18.744 --> 27:21.112
And a long, tedious,
difficult day for the red team...

27:21.113 --> 27:23.214
Oh, it's so warm!

27:25.484 --> 27:27.952
There appears
to be no end in sight.

27:27.953 --> 27:29.687
Really?
Oh, my God!

27:29.688 --> 27:32.323
I thought we were done.
Like...

27:32.324 --> 27:33.758
That's ridiculous.

27:33.759 --> 27:35.559
<i>I'm in
the tub, dude!</i>

27:37.996 --> 27:40.498
I am so pissed
right now.

27:41.800 --> 27:43.267
Thank you.

27:43.268 --> 27:45.202
That's it?

27:45.203 --> 27:46.937
It's a small box.

27:46.938 --> 27:49.407
<i>It says "to the contestants
of Hell's Kitchen.</i>

27:49.408 --> 27:50.708
Open immediately."

27:50.709 --> 27:54.045
I have no idea
what this could be.

27:54.046 --> 27:57.248
Special delivery!
Come on, guys!

27:57.249 --> 27:59.650
Everybody has to
be in the living room now.

27:59.651 --> 28:01.085
<i>Dana, hurry up!</i>

28:01.086 --> 28:02.453
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

28:02.454 --> 28:03.821
Anything could be inside
of that little box

28:03.822 --> 28:04.989
at this point and time.

28:04.990 --> 28:07.691
My nerves are like...
my heart...

28:07.692 --> 28:10.027
What the is
in that thing?

28:10.028 --> 28:13.364
<i>All right.
Let's see what it is.</i>

28:16.768 --> 28:18.536
What is it?

28:23.279 --> 28:25.013
<i>Special delivery!</i>

28:25.014 --> 28:27.015
At the end of a
long day for both teams,

28:27.016 --> 28:29.684
the chefs have received
a mysterious delivery.

28:29.685 --> 28:31.753
All right,
let's see what it is.

28:31.754 --> 28:33.121
Could be anything.

28:33.122 --> 28:35.790
Come on!
What's in the box?

28:35.791 --> 28:38.693
"Please play when all chefs
are present."

28:38.694 --> 28:39.961
All right, ready?
All right, shh.

28:39.962 --> 28:41.429
Good evening.

28:41.430 --> 28:42.931
I seriously hope
you're all having

28:42.932 --> 28:44.332
a relaxing time in the dorm.

28:44.333 --> 28:46.434
But that's about to change.

28:46.435 --> 28:48.403
<i>Now listen carefully.</i>

28:48.404 --> 28:51.272
Tomorrow night's
dinner service...

28:51.273 --> 28:54.242
It's red versus blue menu.

28:54.243 --> 28:56.678
<i>You've all got one hour
to produce a stunning menu</i>

28:56.679 --> 28:58.613
with three appetizers,
three entrees,

28:58.614 --> 29:01.516
and three phenomenal desserts.

29:01.517 --> 29:03.017
What are you waiting for?
Don't stare at me.

29:03.018 --> 29:04.853
Come on, let's go!

29:04.854 --> 29:05.987
This is awesome!

29:05.988 --> 29:08.690
We get to create our own menu.

29:08.691 --> 29:10.658
<i>Can I write, please?
Does anybody mind?</i>

29:10.659 --> 29:12.727
This is a
really big opportunity

29:12.728 --> 29:14.229
to show chef Ramsay

29:14.230 --> 29:15.830
what we're made of.

29:15.831 --> 29:17.665
For apps, don't you think
we should do one salad?

29:17.666 --> 29:19.601
Yeah, I think one salad.

29:19.602 --> 29:20.969
All right, so like, with beets?

29:20.970 --> 29:22.437
Yeah.

29:22.438 --> 29:24.539
I think we should do it with frisee.
Okay.

29:24.540 --> 29:26.741
<i>I'm gonna put roasted...
roasted beet salad.</i>

29:26.742 --> 29:29.310
What else do we wanna see?
Flatbread?

29:29.311 --> 29:30.979
I think a flatbread is nice.

29:30.980 --> 29:32.747
I'm totally stoked.

29:32.748 --> 29:35.550
I'm really wanting to get my
thoughts and ideas on this menu.

29:35.551 --> 29:36.951
We could do mussels.

29:36.952 --> 29:38.620
No, I don't think so.

29:38.621 --> 29:40.421
Everybody eats mussels.

29:40.422 --> 29:43.725
It just doesn't sound like...
something, like, exciting to me.

29:43.726 --> 29:45.593
They always put me
on the backburner.

29:45.594 --> 29:47.228
I guess I'm not a great chef.

29:47.229 --> 29:48.663
<i>Can we all agree halibut
for the fish?</i>

29:48.664 --> 29:50.198
Yeah.

29:50.199 --> 29:52.233
I think we should crust, though,
the halibut in something.

29:52.234 --> 29:53.534
We could do
a beer-batter crust.

29:53.535 --> 29:55.136
No.

29:55.137 --> 29:57.372
For real?

29:57.373 --> 30:00.108
Kimmie, you're killing me.
That's not fine dining.

30:00.109 --> 30:02.744
We gotta stay away from fried.

30:02.745 --> 30:04.646
This is about to be
a battle of the dishes,

30:04.647 --> 30:06.547
and I'm here to fight
for what I want.

30:06.548 --> 30:08.316
Everything I keep
coming up with,

30:08.317 --> 30:10.752
it's "No, it's not good.
No, it's not good."

30:10.753 --> 30:14.889
We could do a duck confit
with cassoulet.

30:14.890 --> 30:17.759
Yeah, I think that's good.

30:17.760 --> 30:20.461
While Kimmie and her
teammates are on different wavelengths,

30:20.462 --> 30:23.231
on the blue team,
Robyn and Justin...

30:23.232 --> 30:25.099
Why don't we do, like,
a corn chowder stew,

30:25.100 --> 30:26.234
put a fried oyster on top
and caviar?

30:26.235 --> 30:27.735
No, that's tough.

30:27.736 --> 30:29.170
Are on different planets.

30:29.171 --> 30:30.605
Artichoke francaise?

30:30.606 --> 30:32.307
Dude, we're going
way too old school.

30:32.308 --> 30:33.408
What about doing
a lobster roll?

30:33.409 --> 30:35.043
It's kinda boring.

30:35.044 --> 30:37.145
I don't really see it
fitting in, though, honestly.

30:37.146 --> 30:40.715
Robyn's ideas sounded like
something I can get at a deli.

30:40.716 --> 30:44.085
I don't really feel that she
has a fine-dining sensibility.

30:44.086 --> 30:45.987
She's just kind of
all over the place for me.

30:45.988 --> 30:47.221
I got a great one.

30:47.222 --> 30:49.324
Scallops, and then
a little lobster

30:49.325 --> 30:51.059
and then pipe it
into squash blossom.

30:51.060 --> 30:52.527
Okay.
Boom. Easy.

30:52.528 --> 30:54.629
I do like it.
I do like it.

30:54.630 --> 30:56.164
Me and Justin are completely
on the same page.

30:56.165 --> 30:57.832
We get each other.

30:57.833 --> 30:59.634
I really don't think that
a steak au poivre is bad idea.

30:59.635 --> 31:00.702
I'm with it.

31:00.703 --> 31:02.270
Let's do it.

31:02.271 --> 31:04.839
We both understand
what we need to do

31:04.840 --> 31:06.341
and what chef Ramsay wants.

31:06.342 --> 31:07.909
We don't want
too simple.

31:07.910 --> 31:09.944
Keep it simple, stupid.
Simple, stupid.

31:09.945 --> 31:11.813
All right, no, ready?
I got it another one.

31:11.814 --> 31:13.581
Why don't we do, like,
a ring mold?

31:13.582 --> 31:16.484
Avocado, crab meat,
fruit in there as well.

31:16.485 --> 31:20.121
Chef's gonna be like "What?
What are you doing? 1980?"

31:20.122 --> 31:22.523
<i>Justin, get out
of the box a little bit.</i>

31:22.524 --> 31:24.759
<i>I'm out of the box.
That's 1980s.</i>

31:24.760 --> 31:26.427
Are you kidding me?

31:26.428 --> 31:28.363
Who the made you boss?

31:28.364 --> 31:29.430
What about a red snapper?

31:29.431 --> 31:30.598
No, no, no, no.

31:30.599 --> 31:31.933
<i>Not a huge snapper fan.</i>

31:31.934 --> 31:34.302
But he needs to have input too.

31:34.303 --> 31:36.738
The blue team...
it's only Justin and Brian.

31:36.739 --> 31:38.406
<i>We better get something
going on.</i>

31:38.407 --> 31:40.241
Sea bass.
I'm digging that.

31:40.242 --> 31:42.510
<i>Beautiful.</i>

31:42.511 --> 31:45.913
While Justin and Brian
hijack the blue team's menu,

31:45.914 --> 31:47.882
the red team is almost done...

31:47.883 --> 31:49.484
Okay, go big or go home.

31:49.485 --> 31:51.419
Rib eye, I think,
might be a good way to go.

31:51.420 --> 31:53.287
But Kimmie isn't.

31:53.288 --> 31:54.589
I could do that barbeque sauce
I did the other day.

31:54.590 --> 31:57.959
Oh, I wouldn't do that.
No.

31:57.960 --> 32:02.063
Barbeque sauce on a steak?
This is sophistication!

32:02.064 --> 32:03.998
This isn't down-home,
country cooking.

32:03.999 --> 32:05.867
What if we put red wine
in your barbeque too?

32:05.868 --> 32:07.435
Do you mind that?

32:07.436 --> 32:09.871
That's what I put in there.
I put that at the end.

32:09.872 --> 32:12.273
Wait,
wasn't it, like, Asian-ish?

32:12.274 --> 32:16.878
No. I think it's a good idea
to put it on there.

32:16.879 --> 32:18.946
Everything with Kimmie
gets taken personally.

32:18.947 --> 32:20.181
<i>I feel like
we can make it sound</i>

32:20.182 --> 32:21.249
<i>nicer than barbeque sauce.</i>

32:21.250 --> 32:23.084
Yeah, like same ingredients...
everything...

32:23.085 --> 32:24.519
but just call it
something different.

32:24.520 --> 32:26.054
We'll call it something
different. Is that okay?

32:26.055 --> 32:28.189
I mean, but it's barbeque sauce.
That's what it is.

32:28.190 --> 32:30.024
I mean, we can figure
something out

32:30.025 --> 32:31.459
that just has, like...
it's not barbeque.

32:31.460 --> 32:33.094
We can call it fancy-style
red wine jus.

32:33.095 --> 32:36.898
Kimmie, it'll still really be
your sauce...

32:36.899 --> 32:39.267
But we're gonna make it sound
a lot nicer.

32:39.268 --> 32:41.569
Whatever y'all wanna do, man.

32:41.570 --> 32:42.970
You know what?
I'm done, dude!

32:42.971 --> 32:44.272
I'm finished.

32:44.273 --> 32:45.573
Just let me do my sauces
like I asked

32:45.574 --> 32:46.974
and everything'll be fine.

32:46.975 --> 32:48.709
We're done.
Yeah, we're done.

32:48.710 --> 32:50.445
All right.
Good night, ladies.

32:50.446 --> 32:52.046
We all feel confident?

32:52.047 --> 32:53.181
Yes.

32:53.182 --> 32:54.715
I'm happy.

32:54.716 --> 32:57.185
None of the dishes
are very complicated.

32:57.186 --> 32:59.654
But if everyone can't
execute 'em correctly,

32:59.655 --> 33:01.155
we're gonna be in deep trouble.

33:01.156 --> 33:02.990
What can go wrong
will go wrong.

33:02.991 --> 33:05.460
Story of my life, but whatever.

33:08.931 --> 33:11.332
Chef Ramsay
has challenged the teams

33:11.333 --> 33:13.101
to design their own menus.

33:13.102 --> 33:15.269
And now the chefs will only have
a few hours

33:15.270 --> 33:17.105
to prepare nine
brand-new dishes

33:17.106 --> 33:19.273
in time for tonight's
dinner service.

33:19.274 --> 33:20.508
Whoo!
That was close.

33:20.509 --> 33:21.876
I almost cut the nail off.

33:21.877 --> 33:23.711
But one chef on the red team...

33:23.712 --> 33:25.746
<i>Christina, how do
you wanna do this chard?</i>

33:25.747 --> 33:27.181
Doesn't even
know where to start.

33:27.182 --> 33:28.382
<i>I don't know what I'm supposed
to be doing with this.</i>

33:28.383 --> 33:29.717
Do I drizzle?

33:29.718 --> 33:32.386
No, don't do that.

33:32.387 --> 33:34.155
I mean, I don't know
what's going on.

33:34.156 --> 33:35.289
Kimmie is definitely
the weakest link

33:35.290 --> 33:36.824
on the red team right now.

33:36.825 --> 33:38.292
So I'm just adding all this,
right?

33:38.293 --> 33:39.660
I don't wanna screw this up.

33:39.661 --> 33:42.163
She can't really do anything

33:42.164 --> 33:44.499
without asking everyone
what she should do.

33:44.500 --> 33:47.101
Just winging it right now.

33:47.102 --> 33:49.103
Prep is hectic, but...

33:49.104 --> 33:50.738
I'm about to kick some ass
on the barbeque sauce.

33:50.739 --> 33:52.106
So it's all good.

33:52.107 --> 33:54.075
You wanna taste this?

33:54.076 --> 33:57.278
<i>Should I add some water?
It's really...</i>

33:57.279 --> 33:59.147
It's pungent.
I'm sorry.

33:59.148 --> 34:01.449
I spit that out
because I hate alcohol.

34:01.450 --> 34:04.986
Should I add water to make it
not so Jack-Daniel-y?

34:04.987 --> 34:06.254
Or more soy?

34:06.255 --> 34:07.722
I think more soy.

34:07.723 --> 34:09.891
All I'm tasting is um...
Honey and Jack Daniels.

34:09.891 --> 34:12.860
Kimmie, we gave you this dish
because we felt like

34:12.860 --> 34:16.429
it was the one thing you knew
you could breeze right through.

34:16.431 --> 34:19.132
And now you can't
figure it out.

34:19.134 --> 34:22.737
Oh!

34:22.737 --> 34:26.072
Oh, let's see if
this is gonna be a winner.

34:26.074 --> 34:28.976
Taste that.

34:31.146 --> 34:33.880
Yeah.
Yay!

34:33.882 --> 34:37.118
While Kimmie has finally
made something out of her sauce,

34:37.119 --> 34:39.187
in the blue kitchen,
Clemenza...

34:39.188 --> 34:41.188
me.

34:41.190 --> 34:43.123
Makes a mess of himself.

34:43.125 --> 34:45.525
Really?
Right now this has gotta happen?

34:45.527 --> 34:47.161
Everybody needs to have
a sense of urgency.

34:47.161 --> 34:48.663
We gotta get focused.

34:48.664 --> 34:50.264
We gotta have all our
together.

34:50.264 --> 34:52.266
I stayed clean all day
until that.

34:52.266 --> 34:54.402
Come on, man, please.
No, no, no, no.

34:54.402 --> 34:56.704
I'm a mess!

34:56.705 --> 34:58.940
You really think I'm gonna let
chef Ramsay yell at me for it?

34:58.941 --> 35:01.108
<i>Clemenza?
Yes, chef.</i>

35:01.109 --> 35:02.777
Try to stay clean.

35:02.778 --> 35:04.345
I will, chef.

35:04.346 --> 35:06.414
You're like a pig rolling around
in all day long.

35:06.415 --> 35:08.849
I have to get
this clean and get back.

35:08.850 --> 35:11.118
I gotta clean up.

35:11.119 --> 35:13.621
Now Clemenza's pissing me off.

35:13.622 --> 35:15.423
There's a lot
of prep work to do.

35:15.424 --> 35:17.124
We need to have this
ready soon.

35:17.125 --> 35:18.492
We'll never be able
to get it done.

35:18.493 --> 35:20.728
<i>Clemenza!
Where you at?</i>

35:20.729 --> 35:23.698
With Clemenza spending
his time cleaning himself,

35:23.699 --> 35:26.467
in the red kitchen,
Barbie is spending her time

35:26.468 --> 35:28.469
meticulously cleaning
the mussels.

35:28.470 --> 35:30.638
I don't have time
right now.

35:30.639 --> 35:31.839
And with dinner
service fast approaching...

35:31.840 --> 35:33.541
You guys need to hurry up.

35:33.542 --> 35:35.109
Everyone is
feeling the pressure.

35:35.110 --> 35:36.510
Pick it up, let's go!

35:36.511 --> 35:38.212
We need to see plates
on the pass.

35:38.213 --> 35:39.981
Barbie's been doing mussels
for about two hours.

35:39.982 --> 35:41.515
So that's really helpful.

35:43.719 --> 35:45.419
Has anybody said anything

35:45.420 --> 35:47.021
about the mussels
taking two and a half hours?

35:47.022 --> 35:48.956
I'm not gonna hit her,
I'm not gonna hit her.

35:48.957 --> 35:50.424
<i>I'm not gonna hit her,
I'm not gonna hit her.</i>

35:50.425 --> 35:53.160
Yeah, at her pace,
we'll never get done.

35:53.161 --> 35:55.730
It's just gonna take a while,

35:55.731 --> 35:58.132
and Dana seemed to have
a problem with that.

35:58.133 --> 36:00.067
But I don't care.

36:00.068 --> 36:02.303
<i>What the has
she been doing for two hours</i>

36:02.304 --> 36:03.771
<i>with these mussels?
two and a half hours now.</i>

36:03.772 --> 36:06.173
<i>I need to see more plates
up here, guys, let's go.</i>

36:06.174 --> 36:08.976
Barbie is definitely pushing me
to my breaking point.

36:08.977 --> 36:13.147
I can feel the anger and the
frustration, like, right here.

36:13.148 --> 36:15.616
<i>Oh, my God.
I'm gonna hit this bitch.</i>

37:53.317 --> 37:54.784
<i>You wanna slice off
some of the potatoes</i>

37:54.785 --> 37:56.753
<i>and tell me how you feel?</i>

37:56.754 --> 37:59.022
But Tiffany's potatoes
are still a question mark.

37:59.023 --> 38:00.957
All crunchy?

38:00.958 --> 38:03.026
Potatoes aren't done.

38:03.027 --> 38:06.296
Tasted the potatoes, and I
was like, "they're crunchy."

38:06.297 --> 38:08.197
See what it tastes like
when it cools.

38:08.198 --> 38:10.033
No, they're totally not done!
They're crunchy!

38:10.034 --> 38:12.368
What, wait.
You took it out already?

38:12.369 --> 38:14.871
It's not a big deal.

38:14.872 --> 38:17.340
Dana... she thinks
she knows it all,

38:17.341 --> 38:19.442
but I know what fine dining is,

38:19.443 --> 38:23.913
so I shouldn't really
have anything to worry about.

38:23.914 --> 38:25.148
Let's go.

38:25.149 --> 38:26.616
It's only half an hour

38:26.617 --> 38:28.217
until dinner service begins.

38:28.218 --> 38:30.053
But before the doors
of Hell's Kitchen open,

38:30.054 --> 38:32.388
chef Ramsay must approve
each team's menu.

38:32.389 --> 38:33.523
Let's go.

38:33.524 --> 38:35.191
Come on, come on.
Come on.

38:35.192 --> 38:36.659
That's pretty.
I like that.

38:36.660 --> 38:37.827
Look, I know you said
it's 1980s,

38:37.828 --> 38:39.228
but it's sexy, bro.

38:39.229 --> 38:40.697
Where do you think
I should put this, Tiff?

38:40.698 --> 38:41.798
I should go more?
Probably more, huh?

38:41.799 --> 38:43.533
Quail's up.
What do you think?

38:43.534 --> 38:45.001
Blue team definitely
has the better of the dishes.

38:45.002 --> 38:46.536
If we can execute them right,

38:46.537 --> 38:47.704
I think it's gonna be
a landslide.

38:47.705 --> 38:48.838
<i>That's done.
Yeah.</i>

38:48.839 --> 38:50.173
Here we go!

38:50.174 --> 38:51.941
<i>Do we have everything up
at the pass</i>

38:51.942 --> 38:53.610
<i>that needs to be up
at the pass?</i>

38:53.611 --> 38:55.645
<i>Okay, all right,
what are we looking for?</i>

38:55.646 --> 38:57.280
Um, the...Mussels.

38:57.281 --> 38:59.048
It looks sort of...
Washed up.

38:59.049 --> 39:00.617
Almost like something you get

39:00.618 --> 39:02.652
out of the bottom
of the dishwasher.

39:02.653 --> 39:05.288
Definitely not the start
we're looking for.

39:05.289 --> 39:06.923
<i>Messy, messy.</i>

39:06.924 --> 39:09.125
Roasted beet salad, yes?

39:10.828 --> 39:12.328
It just tastes of dirt.

39:12.329 --> 39:14.397
<i>I'm not impressed with that.</i>

39:14.398 --> 39:16.065
We better improve from here,

39:16.066 --> 39:18.201
because we're not off
to a good start.

39:18.202 --> 39:19.769
Flatbread.
Yeah, nice.

39:19.770 --> 39:22.538
The bechamel is lovely.
You nailed that.

39:22.539 --> 39:23.840
Uh, this is...

39:23.841 --> 39:26.109
<i>It's a pan-seared halibut.
Mm-hmm.</i>

39:26.110 --> 39:27.677
Um, it's a lobster-corn
broth.

39:27.678 --> 39:31.047
<i>And, um, corn
and chive fritters.</i>

39:31.048 --> 39:32.515
Yeah, that's nice.

39:32.516 --> 39:33.683
Thank you, I cooked it myself.

39:33.684 --> 39:35.018
Uh, this is?

39:35.019 --> 39:38.521
It's a marinated rib eye.

39:38.522 --> 39:39.722
Delicious.

39:39.723 --> 39:41.357
Whoo-hoo!
He loved it.

39:41.358 --> 39:42.759
And you bitches didn't wanna
listen to me.

39:42.760 --> 39:44.794
Ha ha!
Redemption's a !

39:44.795 --> 39:46.596
That tasted phenomenal.
Good job.

39:46.597 --> 39:48.731
Okay.
Thank you, chef.

39:48.732 --> 39:50.667
Definitely a couple quick
adjustments

39:50.668 --> 39:52.802
and we'll be good
for the start of service.

39:52.803 --> 39:54.771
Now that they have
overcome a major hurdle...

39:54.772 --> 39:56.539
Dana, do you need me to dice up
some tomatoes for you?

39:56.540 --> 39:58.474
Definitely, yeah.

39:58.475 --> 40:00.576
The red team quickly
makes adjustments to their menu.

40:00.577 --> 40:02.211
<i>Okay, blue team, let's go.</i>

40:02.212 --> 40:03.680
Now it's the blue team's turn

40:03.681 --> 40:05.481
to see if their menu
passes chef Ramsay's test.

40:05.482 --> 40:07.750
Cobb salad.
Yes, with a mango puree

40:07.751 --> 40:09.719
and a paprika...
smoked paprika oil.

40:09.720 --> 40:12.588
Visually, it looks like
something out of the 1980s.

40:12.589 --> 40:14.190
Surprise, surprise.

40:14.191 --> 40:15.858
I don't know why
you don't listen.

40:15.859 --> 40:18.561
Obviously I do kinda know
what I'm talking about.

40:18.562 --> 40:21.531
<i>It's like a fruit salad
with a sprinkle of crap.</i>

40:21.532 --> 40:22.899
Okay, next up.

40:22.900 --> 40:24.767
<i>We did a ragout carpaccio.</i>

40:24.768 --> 40:25.968
Uh-huh.

40:25.969 --> 40:27.537
<i>We sear it
and then sliced it up.</i>

40:27.538 --> 40:28.671
There's not an ounce
of seasoning

40:28.672 --> 40:30.707
on the meat.

40:30.708 --> 40:33.576
There's no seasoning anywhere.

40:33.577 --> 40:35.745
<i>Next.
Steak au poivre...</i>

40:35.746 --> 40:38.181
With a bleu cheese mash.

40:38.182 --> 40:39.615
Cut down the onions.

40:39.616 --> 40:41.617
You remember,
we're in California, big boy.

40:41.618 --> 40:44.954
Chef Ramsay doesn't like
at least 75% of our dishes.

40:44.955 --> 40:48.491
Really?

40:48.492 --> 40:51.594
We're gonna crash and burn
tonight, I feel it.

40:51.595 --> 40:53.096
You've got four appetizers.

40:53.097 --> 40:54.363
No, that's the entree.

40:54.364 --> 40:56.499
That's an entree.
Yes, chef.

40:56.500 --> 40:58.034
Go on, then.
What is it?

40:58.035 --> 40:59.535
Grilled quail,
like mediterranean style.

40:59.536 --> 41:01.137
<i>It was marinated
in Rosemary, thyme.</i>

41:01.138 --> 41:02.538
First of all, it's undercooked.

41:02.539 --> 41:05.108
Yeah, pink is fine,
but raw is unacceptable.

41:07.511 --> 41:09.412
Mm.

41:09.413 --> 41:12.882
There's bone everywhere.
You didn't take the bone out?

41:12.883 --> 41:15.384
Not good.
Not good.

41:15.385 --> 41:17.520
I've got a big
chunk of bone.

41:17.521 --> 41:19.188
I'll ask the question again.

41:19.189 --> 41:21.023
You can't check
there's no bone left in there?

41:21.024 --> 41:22.592
I missed the bones.
My fault chef. Yeah.

41:22.593 --> 41:27.830
Clemenza... Bye-bye.

41:27.831 --> 41:29.832
I'm about to kick you
out of here.

41:31.769 --> 41:33.136
See ya later.

41:33.137 --> 41:35.004
<i>Ready to go home?</i>

41:38.575 --> 41:41.210
<i>Next time on Hell's Kitchen...</i>

41:41.211 --> 41:43.179
<i>Ready to go home?</i>

41:43.180 --> 41:45.515
Is Clemenza's
careless, dangerous mistake

41:45.516 --> 41:47.817
the final straw
for chef Ramsay?

41:47.818 --> 41:49.285
<i>Get out!</i>

41:49.286 --> 41:51.354
My faith just went out
the door.

41:51.355 --> 41:52.755
In a service
where the chef's menus

41:52.756 --> 41:54.390
are put to the test...

41:54.391 --> 41:55.825
Piss off, all of you!

41:55.826 --> 41:57.794
<i>Robyn, you give me that?</i>

41:57.795 --> 41:59.896
Justin, you set me up
for failure.

41:59.897 --> 42:02.598
Robyn is out for revenge.

42:02.599 --> 42:03.833
It hurt me so guess what.

42:03.834 --> 42:04.934
I'm gonna hurt you back.

42:04.935 --> 42:06.169
Are you blaming me for that?

42:06.170 --> 42:07.837
I am blaming you, bro.

42:07.838 --> 42:09.172
But what
happens when her plan...

42:09.173 --> 42:10.473
I need more squashes done.

42:10.474 --> 42:11.774
Backfires?

42:11.775 --> 42:13.176
You lying bastard.

42:13.177 --> 42:14.877
<i>You knew
he hadn't got it.</i>

42:14.878 --> 42:16.546
I will nail you
to the post.

42:16.547 --> 42:18.080
What the is going on?

42:18.081 --> 42:19.515
In the red kitchen...

42:19.516 --> 42:22.118
One chef makes a mistake
so horrific...

42:22.119 --> 42:23.286
I thought you cared.

42:23.287 --> 42:25.054
What do you want me to say?

42:25.055 --> 42:27.456
It puts her
whole team in jeopardy.

42:27.457 --> 42:29.358
I don't give a if the
whole team goes home tonight.

42:29.359 --> 42:30.793
I'm so confused right now.

42:30.794 --> 42:33.596
Somebody tell me
what the hell is going on!

42:33.597 --> 42:35.498
It may be red
versus blue menus...

42:35.499 --> 42:37.033
Here you go!

42:37.034 --> 42:38.634
<i>But on the
next Hell's Kitchen...</i>

42:38.635 --> 42:40.336
That's not good enough!

42:40.337 --> 42:42.171
It's every chef...

42:42.172 --> 42:43.573
Bitch, shut the up.

42:43.574 --> 42:45.107
For themselves.

42:45.108 --> 42:47.310
I'm not gonna sit here
and babysit people.

42:47.311 --> 42:49.078
Don't get an attitude with me.

42:49.079 --> 42:49.946
Guarantee it's not
happening now...

42:49.947 --> 42:52.215
We're screwed!
