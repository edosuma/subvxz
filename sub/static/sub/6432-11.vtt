WEBVTT

00:00.090 --> 00:01.859
Previously on Warehouse 13...

00:01.960 --> 00:04.030
Whatever the effects
of the astrolabe,

00:04.270 --> 00:07.300
I'm afraid it's caused Arthur to
have some sort of psychotic break.

00:07.430 --> 00:08.630
Stop right there!

00:09.400 --> 00:11.230
Artie, we can help you.

00:11.230 --> 00:13.530
I am not Artie.

00:13.530 --> 00:16.090
When Artie used the astrolabe,
it turn him evil.

00:16.260 --> 00:18.810
- Who are you?
- You are in my way.

00:19.070 --> 00:20.110
A vibe...

00:20.210 --> 00:22.110
I just got hit with a big one.

00:22.140 --> 00:23.210
Leena?

00:24.250 --> 00:25.220
Oh My God!

00:26.040 --> 00:29.010
The deadliest artifact in Warehouse 8
was a strange, blue orchid...

00:29.040 --> 00:31.850
that released a disease called
English sweating sickness.

00:31.850 --> 00:34.250
I think Artie is going to use
the dagger to open the container

00:34.250 --> 00:35.250
and get the orchid.

00:35.250 --> 00:37.860
He'll release an epidemic
that potentially could wipe out

00:37.860 --> 00:39.830
half of the world's
population.

00:39.900 --> 00:42.480
I know you're still in there.
I know you can hear me.

00:42.900 --> 00:44.860
- Save me.
- I cast you out!

00:44.860 --> 00:46.200
Claudia, no!

00:48.000 --> 00:54.074

00:57.440 --> 00:59.750
Do you really think that
you'd get away with it?

00:59.950 --> 01:02.360
I have no idea what
you are talking about.

01:03.640 --> 01:07.290
Well, somebody ate the last of the
oatmeal scotchies in the kitchen.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.430
And you automatically blame me.

01:10.530 --> 01:12.150
Where's due process?

01:12.460 --> 01:15.360
Have we lost all
semblance of civility?

01:16.150 --> 01:18.390
You have crumbs on
your shirt, Artie.

01:19.520 --> 01:21.130
It's circumstantial.

01:21.730 --> 01:23.180
Didn't somebody tell me that...

01:23.180 --> 01:24.620
that they'd like to lose ten
pounds by summer,

01:24.720 --> 01:26.620
and that I should
lock out all the sweets?

01:26.620 --> 01:28.520
Yes, and you've done
a terrible job.

01:28.580 --> 01:29.840
But don't worry...

01:30.970 --> 01:31.830
I forgive you.

01:51.030 --> 01:52.800
We are going in! Hold there!

01:52.800 --> 01:54.780
Lot of wind!
This could get rough!

02:09.850 --> 02:12.450
He was back I swear,
It was our Artie.

02:12.450 --> 02:15.450
He said my name and I saw it
in his eyes for a second, before...

02:15.450 --> 02:17.950
She had to stabbed him, Ok?
There was no other way.

02:18.130 --> 02:20.440
He...
he was good again and then...

02:20.620 --> 02:21.890
then he was gone.

02:22.650 --> 02:24.510
We must deal with the
release of the sickness.

02:24.510 --> 02:26.700
Every person on the planet
is now at risk.

02:26.700 --> 02:28.410
We have a great
deal of work to do.

02:44.750 --> 02:45.980
Turning now to world news...

02:45.980 --> 02:48.450
doctors in Europe are
reporting a curious outbreak.

02:48.450 --> 02:51.490
Dozens of patients have turned
up complaining of dizziness

02:51.490 --> 02:54.010
and dehydration due to
a excessive sweating.

02:54.150 --> 02:57.490
It's all being chalked up to
the unseasonable hot, humid whether

02:57.490 --> 02:59.800
that's gripped western
Europe this past week.

02:59.990 --> 03:02.490
Officials are asking people
to stay indoors, and drink...

03:02.490 --> 03:03.420
plenty of water...

03:03.470 --> 03:05.110
till the heat wave passes.

03:05.190 --> 03:06.280
When we come back...

03:06.280 --> 03:07.860
Why is the Secretary of State...

03:07.860 --> 03:09.550
taking salsa lessons?

03:09.690 --> 03:11.170
The answer might surprise you.

03:11.170 --> 03:12.550
More after the break.

03:18.120 --> 03:20.290
We're all infected with
the sweating sickness.

03:20.290 --> 03:22.790
Dr. Calder
is in Atlanta with the CDC.

03:22.790 --> 03:24.230
She says we don't
have very much time.

03:24.300 --> 03:25.540
Before what?

03:25.610 --> 03:27.330
What... what happens?

03:27.500 --> 03:29.430
Chills, rapid pulse...

03:29.640 --> 03:31.880
intense thirst, heart pain.

03:32.090 --> 03:32.980
Ultimately, death.

03:33.120 --> 03:36.080
Right, yes, it's always
"ultimately, death".

03:36.320 --> 03:39.320
I mean, artifacts never
release a plague of tickles...

03:39.320 --> 03:41.580
or an epidemic of kittens.

03:41.580 --> 03:42.600
Some do.

03:42.730 --> 03:44.250
They end badly too.

03:44.340 --> 03:46.420
I've been coordinating with
the rest of the Regents.

03:46.540 --> 03:49.140
The virus is spreading even
more rapidly than we though.

03:50.150 --> 03:51.350
How much time do we have?

03:51.420 --> 03:53.860
The incubation period
is usually 24 hours

03:53.860 --> 03:55.920
We left Germany eight hours ago.

03:55.920 --> 03:57.880
So we have 16 hours to fix
what Artie did.

03:57.880 --> 03:59.160
It wasn't Artie!

03:59.890 --> 04:01.020
No our Artie.

04:01.020 --> 04:02.880
How is he? now? I mean...

04:02.880 --> 04:04.100
He is still catatonic.

04:04.220 --> 04:06.090
We were able to remove the dagger.

04:06.970 --> 04:08.300
No internal damage, of course.

04:08.580 --> 04:10.090
How is that even possible?

04:11.680 --> 04:12.970
Claudia knows.

04:15.210 --> 04:17.470
I didn't know, not then.

04:17.470 --> 04:19.260
At least, I wasn't sure.
I was just...

04:19.360 --> 04:21.980
Acting on instinct, and
you did very well.

04:21.980 --> 04:23.880
Why? How does the dagger work?

04:24.880 --> 04:25.700
Tell them.

04:26.420 --> 04:27.450
You know.

04:28.190 --> 04:29.600
The... the dagger...

04:29.840 --> 04:31.890
separates something evil...

04:31.890 --> 04:34.190
the orchid, from something good...

04:34.520 --> 04:36.460
the box holding it.
So with Artie...

04:36.460 --> 04:39.490
You separated the evil from Artie.
You brought him back.

04:39.660 --> 04:42.120
It belonged to a
Jesuit priest who...

04:42.250 --> 04:44.360
performs the first exorcism.

04:44.360 --> 04:46.030
I didn't know what
I was doing, I just...

04:46.030 --> 04:48.030
knew I had to do it, but now...

04:48.170 --> 04:49.480
we could still lose him.

04:49.650 --> 04:50.910
We could, yes.

04:50.910 --> 04:51.820
But you do have a plan.

04:51.960 --> 04:53.060
We have a theory.

04:54.880 --> 04:55.750
You two...

04:55.750 --> 04:57.160
You're with me. Come on.

04:57.380 --> 04:58.380
Come on!

05:02.630 --> 05:04.810
Artie's mind seems to be failing.

05:05.670 --> 05:07.260
And you can't pull him out of it?

05:07.290 --> 05:08.910
When Dr. "V" gets here,
maybe she can...

05:08.910 --> 05:10.050
There isn't time.

05:10.100 --> 05:12.560
We need to reach his
subconscious and pull him back.

05:12.570 --> 05:14.720
Before his mind
completely shuts down.

05:14.720 --> 05:17.000
- If we don't...
- Artie won't come home.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.940
So... what's your theory?

05:21.490 --> 05:22.870
An artifact, right?

05:23.080 --> 05:24.080
What else?

05:27.310 --> 05:28.450
What do we know thus far?

05:28.450 --> 05:31.950
Well we know that sweating
sickness first occurred in Europe,

05:32.070 --> 05:35.930
and that there were several
outbreaks between 1485 and 1551.

05:35.990 --> 05:38.070
Also we know that some of the
outbreaks are said to have

05:38.070 --> 05:40.160
wipe out half the
populations they hit.

05:40.160 --> 05:41.680
And every time,
the disease vanished.

05:41.720 --> 05:44.930
Right. The orchid turns
to ash releases the plague.

05:44.970 --> 05:45.650
Right, but...

05:45.750 --> 05:48.100
but when we found
the orchid, it was wholly.

05:48.100 --> 05:51.090
even thought it had already
released the disease in the 1500s.

05:51.090 --> 05:54.100
So there must be a way
to reconstituted it.

05:54.140 --> 05:56.430
An artifact that brings
a flower back to life.

05:58.410 --> 06:00.050
Nothing springs to mind.

06:01.580 --> 06:02.460
I know.

06:03.010 --> 06:04.620
I wish Artie was here.

06:07.110 --> 06:09.490
But who am I kidding?
Even if we save him...

06:09.490 --> 06:11.390
I mean, the man killed Leena!

06:12.460 --> 06:14.330
How does he come back from that?

06:15.220 --> 06:16.250
How do we?

06:19.380 --> 06:23.140
Both Leena and Arthur care
about one thing above all else...

06:23.240 --> 06:25.890
and that is keeping the
world save from harm.

06:28.800 --> 06:30.680
We will find a solution.

06:36.330 --> 06:38.000
Right, so...

06:38.000 --> 06:40.950
I have artifacts that
make flowers huge.

06:40.990 --> 06:42.710
I have got artifact
that make them...

06:42.710 --> 06:45.090
poisonous, that make them
not poisonous...

06:45.090 --> 06:48.090
but not a single one that
turns ashes into an orchid.

06:48.090 --> 06:49.670
The Count of Saint Germain!

06:49.960 --> 06:52.930
- Who?
- He was a charlatan in the 18th century.

06:52.930 --> 06:55.730
He claimed many supernatural
abilities including,

06:55.730 --> 06:57.460
the power to bring
sickly plants...

06:57.460 --> 06:59.940
back to bountiful,
blooming health.

07:00.070 --> 07:02.640
He, he performed the trick
in public several times.

07:02.680 --> 07:04.350
It sounds like the Count
was using an artifact.

07:04.350 --> 07:07.280
Yes, the question is what,
and where is it now?

07:07.410 --> 07:08.440
Keep digging.

07:08.480 --> 07:10.350
This belonged to Sigmund Freud.

07:10.350 --> 07:13.360
It will allow your subconscious
to interact with Artie's...

07:13.360 --> 07:15.790
and hopefully, discover
why he is trapped.

07:15.790 --> 07:17.060
Yes, done, I'm in.

07:17.370 --> 07:18.620
You are not going
in without me.

07:18.660 --> 07:20.620
Why do you think I asked
for both of you?

07:26.830 --> 07:29.800
No one seemed to take The Count
seriously or what he did.

07:29.800 --> 07:33.200
There's no references to what
artifact he might have used.

07:33.200 --> 07:34.980
There's very little
information about him.

07:34.980 --> 07:36.290
Hey, hey, hey.

07:36.470 --> 07:38.360
I think this guy's got the dirt.

07:39.510 --> 07:41.210
"Bennett Sutton,

07:41.250 --> 07:43.710
"Professor at Columbia University,

07:43.710 --> 07:46.410
"foremost expert on the
court Marie Antoniette".

07:46.410 --> 07:48.120
Yes. And if he stake is right,

07:48.120 --> 07:50.660
guess who spent a lot of time
crushing at Marie's couch?

07:50.690 --> 07:52.090
The Count of Saint Germain.

07:52.090 --> 07:53.660
He wrote a lot about him.

07:53.760 --> 07:54.970
It's worth the shot, right?

07:54.970 --> 07:56.940
Talk to him,
find out what he knows.

07:56.940 --> 07:58.030
And...

08:01.200 --> 08:02.550
you might need this.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.440
When you are ready...

08:14.680 --> 08:15.910
join hands.

08:32.429 --> 08:33.630
Holly metaphor!

08:34.220 --> 08:35.710
Artie's brain is...

08:35.710 --> 08:37.169
The warehouse.

08:39.039 --> 08:40.659
Well, I can't say I'm surprised.

08:40.690 --> 08:42.070
I figured out it be either this or...

08:42.070 --> 08:44.280
magical land made
entirely of doughnuts.

08:45.300 --> 08:46.790
Artie could be anywhere.

08:46.790 --> 08:47.760
Not really.

08:47.760 --> 08:50.650
Think about it. If the warehouse
is his brain, where would he live?

08:50.920 --> 08:53.180
His office is his
real life nerve center.

08:53.190 --> 08:54.920
Nice, we just have
to get over there.

08:56.090 --> 08:57.490
You need to leave.

08:59.360 --> 09:01.060
Vanessa, good. You are here...

09:01.060 --> 09:03.560
Will you, for once,
do what you're told?

09:03.680 --> 09:04.830
Wait a minute.

09:05.530 --> 09:06.730
That's not Vanessa.

09:06.730 --> 09:09.130
Look at her, she is dress up
what with she's wearing in Rapid City.

09:09.170 --> 09:11.360
This must be the version of
Vanessa that lives in Artie's head,

09:11.360 --> 09:12.600
his memory of her.

09:15.170 --> 09:16.440
I'll go check that out.

09:19.980 --> 09:21.430
You need to leave.

09:21.880 --> 09:23.250
It's not safe.

09:23.520 --> 09:26.550
- We need to save Artie.
- Artie doesn't want you here.

09:27.390 --> 09:29.500
- I'm sorry, I'm not going to take...
- Claudia!

09:34.430 --> 09:35.890
This whole place is shutting down.

09:35.890 --> 09:37.240
And so is Artie.

09:37.250 --> 09:39.000
You see? It's too dangerous.

09:40.750 --> 09:42.200
You should go, right now.

09:46.200 --> 09:47.620
Professor Sutton?

09:47.860 --> 09:49.180
Hello?

09:49.600 --> 09:52.060
- Wow...
- Oh my God...

09:52.470 --> 09:54.520
This place looks like
it's being tossed.

09:54.520 --> 09:57.370
Maybe we are not the only
ones after this Professor.

09:58.720 --> 10:02.200
Excuse me, ma'am,
was there a break-in here?

10:02.200 --> 10:05.540
No! Professor Sutton's office
always looks this way.

10:06.040 --> 10:08.080
Kind of makes my room look
pretty good, don't it?

10:08.090 --> 10:10.430
Ah...well, we are supposed
to have a meeting with him.

10:10.430 --> 10:12.600
Do...do you know where he is?

10:16.420 --> 10:17.350
Company!

10:19.140 --> 10:20.210
Enjoy!

10:21.510 --> 10:22.620
There he is!

10:27.720 --> 10:29.910
Whoever you are,
you are hovering.

10:30.550 --> 10:31.440
Speak.

10:31.820 --> 10:34.480
Or pour me a drink...
and don't speak.

10:36.110 --> 10:37.820
Professor,
we have an appointment.

10:41.760 --> 10:43.430
The Government's agents.

10:44.740 --> 10:48.530
Uh, it turns out my day is full.
Afraid I'll have to postpone. Regrets.

10:49.370 --> 10:50.820
Oh, well...

10:51.210 --> 10:53.390
Well, you are reasonably hot.

10:54.650 --> 10:56.830
What say you ditch the...

10:56.830 --> 11:00.010
forehead here,
and interrogate me?

11:00.210 --> 11:02.530
What say you just stay here
and answer our questions?

11:02.890 --> 11:05.700
Sexy... ask me anything.

11:05.910 --> 11:06.760
Well...

11:11.330 --> 11:13.790
This is the man who is supposed
to help us save the world?

11:17.050 --> 11:19.520
Don't tell the world,
it will panic.

11:28.450 --> 11:30.070
Hey, hey, professor!

11:30.070 --> 11:31.160
Hey, wake up.

11:31.940 --> 11:34.500
Listen, we need you to tell us
everything you know about...

11:34.500 --> 11:35.560
The count of Saint Germain.

11:35.560 --> 11:38.580
That's remarkable, you could
rent it out as billboard space.

11:38.580 --> 11:40.110
Oh, really? Well,
we could rent you out

11:40.110 --> 11:41.990
- as a kerosene lamp, okay?
- Pete!

11:42.000 --> 11:43.630
We are running out of time.

11:44.190 --> 11:47.430
There is always time for love,
mon cheri, no?

11:47.430 --> 11:48.220
No!

11:49.650 --> 11:51.340
Fine, all right!

11:52.560 --> 11:53.920
Look out.

11:54.520 --> 11:56.870
Attaboy. You all right?

11:57.000 --> 11:58.270
Yeah.

11:58.950 --> 12:00.280
I'm a little drunk.

12:00.350 --> 12:01.930
Right... The Count...

12:02.150 --> 12:03.340
was a scoundrel.

12:03.940 --> 12:05.070
A grifter.

12:05.070 --> 12:08.200
Claimed wild, supernatural
abilities, but...

12:08.320 --> 12:11.130
he was also entertaining,
which...

12:11.420 --> 12:14.330
meant a lot the days
before reality TV.

12:14.460 --> 12:16.160
He must have been
incredibly charming,

12:16.400 --> 12:19.640
to wheedle his way into Some
royal courts that, trust me,

12:19.650 --> 12:21.600
wouldn't never have
accepted him otherwise.

12:21.600 --> 12:23.580
Like Marie Antoniette's.

12:23.580 --> 12:24.850
Yes, precisely.

12:25.110 --> 12:27.280
She was a fan, for a while.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.170
Apparently, briefly
enamored of his ability...

12:30.170 --> 12:33.430
to bring any dead or dying
Flora back to vibrant life.

12:33.600 --> 12:35.640
How? how he did it?
was he ever...

12:35.640 --> 12:38.350
holding some kind
of special object?

12:38.350 --> 12:40.020
Holding an object? No.

12:40.240 --> 12:41.700
Not according my research.

12:41.700 --> 12:42.450
Great!

12:42.710 --> 12:44.110
Another dead end.

12:44.260 --> 12:45.370
Although...

12:45.370 --> 12:47.090
he always did wear a rather...

12:47.090 --> 12:48.170
garish ring.

12:48.170 --> 12:49.520
Yes, now we are getting somewhere.

12:51.570 --> 12:53.340
- You are going to throw up, are you?
- Oh, no, no, no!

12:53.340 --> 12:54.990
- Hold on, hold on!
- Pete, get him a...

12:55.000 --> 12:57.070
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

12:58.410 --> 13:01.100
Two steps forward, one puke back.

13:03.060 --> 13:05.030
We can't just leave
Artie in here,

13:05.030 --> 13:07.720
I mean, his brain is shutting down,
he could get stuck.

13:07.720 --> 13:11.090
And if you stay, you could get lost
in here, too. He wasn't want that.

13:11.090 --> 13:12.470
We're just trying to help.

13:12.470 --> 13:13.740
Let's try this.

13:16.030 --> 13:17.360
Claudia... look!

13:17.360 --> 13:19.720
Artie's bag of tricks.
What did I tell you?

13:19.720 --> 13:21.190
There's still some part of him...

13:21.190 --> 13:23.560
that wants us to find him,
it's like in Germany...

13:24.430 --> 13:25.250
Claudia!

13:27.800 --> 13:29.170
I did warn you.

13:30.360 --> 13:31.420
Now, go!

13:33.930 --> 13:36.140
He really wants us to leave.

13:36.760 --> 13:39.060
Won't be the first time I
didn't do what Artie wanted.

13:43.480 --> 13:44.930
Find the ring...

13:46.150 --> 13:46.960
Why?

13:47.790 --> 13:49.400
Uh, for research purposes.

13:49.400 --> 13:51.920
Well, well, it won't be easy.

13:52.310 --> 13:54.710
The Count's things were all buried
with him in the catacombs,

13:54.710 --> 13:55.570
under Paris.

13:55.570 --> 13:57.180
All right, so we go to Paris.

13:57.180 --> 13:59.230
She knows every
language there is.

13:59.300 --> 14:02.070
Well. Your first problem
is that Marie...

14:02.080 --> 14:04.170
placed an impenetrable
lock on the crypt.

14:05.190 --> 14:07.570
It's rather curious actually,
anyone who tries to get through...

14:07.570 --> 14:09.110
wound up flamed alive.

14:09.110 --> 14:10.670
So unless you know
a good locksmith...

14:10.670 --> 14:13.320
Well, we really don't
have problems with locks.

14:13.370 --> 14:14.950
We got a bitchin' set of tools.

14:14.980 --> 14:16.730
It's actually not the locks
that I am worried about...

14:16.730 --> 14:18.250
it's the catacombs under Paris.

14:18.250 --> 14:19.590
Yes, your second problem.

14:19.590 --> 14:21.350
They are notoriously
difficult to navigate.

14:21.350 --> 14:21.930
Okay.

14:21.930 --> 14:24.570
Yes, generations of naive tourist,
crypt raiders,

14:24.570 --> 14:27.140
and drunken university Students
got lost down there,

14:27.280 --> 14:28.140
permanently.

14:28.140 --> 14:30.820
We don't have time to get lost.
The time is running out.

14:31.470 --> 14:32.450
For the...

14:32.670 --> 14:34.530
research that we are doing.

14:34.530 --> 14:36.020
Pete, we have Baudin's map.

14:36.020 --> 14:37.270
- You do?
- We do?

14:37.270 --> 14:39.410
Well, the place that we...

14:39.710 --> 14:40.730
work for...

14:41.040 --> 14:42.090
does.

14:42.090 --> 14:44.470
Nicolas Baudin,
he was a French explorer.

14:44.570 --> 14:47.060
Most people don't know that
he charted the French catacombs...

14:47.120 --> 14:49.530
before he left on his famous
Australian expedition.

14:49.530 --> 14:50.850
No, most people don't.

14:50.850 --> 14:53.350
We could have Mrs. Frederic
scan it and send it to us.

14:53.350 --> 14:54.840
She is our...

14:55.480 --> 14:56.390
- Boss!
- Boss!

14:56.390 --> 14:58.430
I know Baudin's map, but don't...

14:58.430 --> 15:01.540
unfortunately, it's just meaningless
blather without the legend.

15:02.630 --> 15:03.720
He is right.

15:05.260 --> 15:07.280
Why do I have the feeling
that you have this legend?

15:07.280 --> 15:08.720
And I'd be willing to share,

15:08.720 --> 15:10.760
if you could convince
your government friends that...

15:12.700 --> 15:14.870
I don't need to pay taxes,
ever, including what I owe.

15:14.870 --> 15:16.410
How about you just...

15:16.410 --> 15:19.340
give us the legend
and we don't arrest you?

15:19.450 --> 15:21.760
Oh negotiation. Sexy.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.700
Technically, I don't have the
legend, but I know who does.

15:24.700 --> 15:28.130
And by the way, I only flight
first class when others pay.

15:28.300 --> 15:30.850
"I only fly first
class when others pay."

15:34.210 --> 15:35.940
Come on Claud,
this way is still open.

15:38.950 --> 15:39.960
Damn it!

15:40.040 --> 15:41.600
Every room keeps getting blocked.

15:44.570 --> 15:46.210
If there is a way we'll find it.

15:47.440 --> 15:48.250
Or...

15:48.770 --> 15:49.870
we could just...

15:50.280 --> 15:51.510
glare at it.

15:52.490 --> 15:53.870
I hate this.

15:54.260 --> 15:56.280
The warehouse was supposed
to do good...

15:56.600 --> 15:59.140
and instead, it just keeps
killing the people I love.

15:59.240 --> 16:00.110
That's...

16:00.490 --> 16:02.990
- kind of a simplification.
- Is it though?

16:03.410 --> 16:04.500
You died...

16:04.960 --> 16:06.200
Leena died...

16:06.210 --> 16:08.310
and now the whole damn
world is dying.

16:08.310 --> 16:10.990
Claud, Claud, Claud, Pete and
Myka will find a cure, they will.

16:10.990 --> 16:11.860
So what?

16:12.120 --> 16:13.510
It's not going to save Leena.

16:13.630 --> 16:14.510
And Artie?

16:15.320 --> 16:18.420
I stabbed Artie with a dagger!

16:18.420 --> 16:20.900
Why bother if we just keep losing?

16:20.900 --> 16:23.200
Because it's not the win,
it's the fight.

16:23.200 --> 16:25.230
Evil it's relentless,
It always has been.

16:25.300 --> 16:28.230
You take one evil out, and another
one pops out to replace it.

16:28.720 --> 16:30.520
Worst pep talk ever.

16:30.520 --> 16:33.950
But if we stop fighting, if
we give up, what that say about us?

16:35.060 --> 16:38.670
I knew that Sykes was dangerous,
but we had to stop him.

16:39.720 --> 16:41.670
Mrs. Frederic warned Leena
to get out,

16:41.680 --> 16:43.870
but she stayed to help Artie.
And you...

16:43.880 --> 16:45.700
you knew the world needed
saving even...

16:45.700 --> 16:48.070
if it cost you the only
father you've ever known.

16:48.760 --> 16:49.780
The fight...

16:49.980 --> 16:51.380
that's what matters.

16:54.880 --> 16:55.900
Lovely.

16:56.440 --> 16:58.180
But you are asked to go.

17:01.420 --> 17:03.430
- This is not good.
- Oh, it's so bad.

17:05.230 --> 17:06.510
Since you won't go out,

17:06.510 --> 17:09.300
I'll see to it that you
make no farther progress.

17:09.369 --> 17:11.260
What was that you're saying
about knocking out...

17:11.260 --> 17:13.160
one evil and another
one popping out?

17:13.160 --> 17:14.710
Good news is I was right.

17:18.180 --> 17:20.829
This disease is not spreading
it has spread.

17:20.839 --> 17:22.640
Those are words of
Dr. Vanessa Calder

17:22.640 --> 17:24.240
from the CDC in Atlanta.

17:24.240 --> 17:26.339
The illness, which only a few
hours ago was thought...

17:26.339 --> 17:28.940
to be simply dehydration
confined in Europe...

17:28.960 --> 17:32.040
has quickly spread to virtually
every corner of the globe

17:32.160 --> 17:36.060
The CDC is classifying the
outbreak as a world wide pandemic

17:36.060 --> 17:38.110
the fastest to have
been declared as such...

17:38.110 --> 17:39.660
in the agency's history.

17:39.770 --> 17:42.970
We'll be covering this crisis
around the clock. Stay with us.

17:54.720 --> 17:57.420
Wait, the legend is here?

17:57.710 --> 18:00.280
You said it was in a collection.
Somebody lives here.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.920
People live lots of places.

18:01.920 --> 18:04.600
Yes, I bet you know who lives
here and not in the good way.

18:04.600 --> 18:06.720
Don't wrinkle your forehead.
You look like sheet music.

18:06.720 --> 18:07.920
Hey, hey, hey!

18:08.710 --> 18:10.770
I have a handsome forehead, ok?

18:10.940 --> 18:13.560
Just ask my mum.
Ah, and on the plane?

18:13.840 --> 18:15.430
I swiped your nuts.

18:15.740 --> 18:16.490
Wait...

18:16.700 --> 18:19.040
- that's...
- So, who lives here?

18:19.110 --> 18:22.140
Fine, Charlotte Dupres, who as
it turns out is a rival of mine.

18:22.350 --> 18:23.730
Professors have rivals?

18:23.780 --> 18:26.930
Charlotte is merely a collector of,
well funded fan.

18:26.930 --> 18:28.140
I'm the expert.

18:28.280 --> 18:31.390
Well, let's just ask Charlotte if we
can come in a take a picture of the legend.

18:31.390 --> 18:33.890
She'd never agreed to it,
she's paranoid and delusional.

18:33.890 --> 18:35.530
Great, that's what this needs.

18:35.530 --> 18:39.230
She just accused us to try to
break in into her precious home.

18:39.230 --> 18:41.820
Are we, trying to break in
into her precious home?

18:42.130 --> 18:43.540
There is no one at
her precious home.

18:43.540 --> 18:44.750
She is out of the country.

18:46.060 --> 18:48.280
- Where is she?
- Barcelona.

18:48.940 --> 18:50.810
She maybe has received a
message that made her...

18:51.020 --> 18:52.540
leap on the first plane.

18:52.540 --> 18:53.500
Convenient, no?

18:53.500 --> 18:56.330
Ok, it's obvious that
you have another agenda.

18:56.330 --> 18:58.660
So,
can we just stop playing games?

18:58.840 --> 19:00.510
Uh, excellent idea!

19:00.600 --> 19:02.940
Let's just discuss the ring
and your plan to use it.

19:03.070 --> 19:04.630
I am a History Professor.

19:04.630 --> 19:06.870
But I know what sweating
signals looks like.

19:07.530 --> 19:08.660
I know the rumor.

19:08.690 --> 19:11.450
An orchid that can make the
sweating signals come and go?

19:11.560 --> 19:12.870
Am I close to the mark?

19:13.070 --> 19:14.070
- No!
- Maybe.

19:14.900 --> 19:16.730
I think the orchid has
come back again...

19:16.770 --> 19:20.260
and you two need that ring to
reconstitute it to save the world.

19:21.030 --> 19:22.000
Bull's-eye?

19:23.310 --> 19:26.210
I'll take your Slack-Jawed
silence as confirmation.

19:26.240 --> 19:27.310
So...

19:27.640 --> 19:29.910
help me break in here...

19:29.910 --> 19:31.710
stop the disease...

19:31.870 --> 19:33.070
or don't.

19:33.270 --> 19:34.270
And don't.

19:34.510 --> 19:35.640
It's your choice.

19:41.260 --> 19:43.570
Cocoons are not as comfortable
as they sound.

19:43.710 --> 19:45.060
What'd she throw at us?

19:45.100 --> 19:47.650
That's William Hornaday's cap.
Director of the Bronx zoo.

19:47.650 --> 19:50.450
In 1906, he rather
infamously put a human pygmy...

19:50.450 --> 19:53.200
in a cage with chimpanzees to
demonstrate the missing link.

19:53.210 --> 19:55.920
Is this thing getting tighter?
I don't care for this.

19:55.940 --> 19:58.010
They're, like, unbreakable...

19:58.440 --> 19:59.740
and rather tangy.

19:59.780 --> 20:02.070
Pulling at them makes
them tighter, by the way.

20:02.650 --> 20:04.550
The darkness is getting closer.

20:07.750 --> 20:08.690
Claud.

20:09.340 --> 20:10.310
The spear.

20:11.960 --> 20:14.590
Yes, Ok. Yeah,
how are you going to...

20:16.630 --> 20:19.030
Oh, ok, yeah, yeah, I think...

20:19.030 --> 20:20.590
- if you put a little bit more...
- I know, I know.

20:20.590 --> 20:22.500
- Your center of gravity...
- I'm trying to do that, Claud.

20:22.530 --> 20:24.940
I know. I just need a little
bit of concen...

20:24.940 --> 20:28.070
- the center of gravity is lowest...
- I'm a ATF agent, damn it!

20:34.330 --> 20:35.220
Man.

20:36.880 --> 20:39.180
I sure could used you when
I was locked up.

20:39.180 --> 20:41.680
- You have skills!
- Thanks.

20:42.020 --> 20:44.050
- Let's get to the office.
- Good plan.

20:44.190 --> 20:45.220
Good plan.

20:47.730 --> 20:50.730
Hello, miss Donovan.
Long time no see.

20:50.730 --> 20:52.520
Oh, man I hate Artie's brain.

20:56.930 --> 20:57.970
Alarm system.

20:58.070 --> 21:00.550
Yeah, you've got 15 seconds
before the alarm goes off.

21:00.620 --> 21:01.440
Okay. Okay.

21:02.980 --> 21:05.410
I got this.
I saw Artie do it once.

21:05.410 --> 21:07.680
Not that I've tried,
but Charlotte's birth date

21:07.750 --> 21:09.470
and license plate
numbers didn't work.

21:12.680 --> 21:13.680
Bingo!

21:14.230 --> 21:17.610
Brilliant toys. I wish
I would met you two years ago.

21:19.120 --> 21:21.600
So you try to break in here before.

21:23.030 --> 21:24.960
What exactly, are you after?

21:24.960 --> 21:27.760
Ticktock, sweating sickness.
Shall we proceed?

21:27.800 --> 21:30.390
Find the legend, save
the world, et cetera, et cetera.

21:37.910 --> 21:40.540
All right, children,
playtime's over.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.950
Olly olly oxen free.

21:43.210 --> 21:44.750
That's Macpherson?

21:44.970 --> 21:46.550
I always pictured
him with a mustache.

21:46.580 --> 21:49.690
Why does Artie even have
James Macpherson in his brain?

21:50.050 --> 21:51.520
He hates Macpherson.

21:51.720 --> 21:54.560
Arthur sees me as
the embodiment of...

21:54.790 --> 21:56.660
danger and evil.

21:56.800 --> 21:58.060
And he can hear us.

21:58.100 --> 22:00.400
But he also knows I'm very
strong, and right now,

22:00.400 --> 22:03.960
he needs someone powerful
to get you two out!

22:04.600 --> 22:06.300
Good casting, Artie.

22:06.640 --> 22:08.970
I'm out of ideas.
You have any?

22:09.230 --> 22:10.970
Just one.
You are not going to like it.

22:11.570 --> 22:13.860
Remember, you are the one
who can really save Artie.

22:14.150 --> 22:15.810
Steve, what are you doing?

22:16.010 --> 22:19.110
Stick with me, Claud!
Macpherson will never catch up.

22:22.540 --> 22:23.700
So brave!

22:24.350 --> 22:28.140
The real Macpherson would
have enjoy this very much.

22:28.140 --> 22:29.900
- Hunting human targets?
- No!

22:30.070 --> 22:32.600
- Caching them!
- Not today, James.

22:36.030 --> 22:37.860
What happened? Where is Claudia?

22:37.990 --> 22:39.340
She is still in there.

22:40.450 --> 22:41.410
I hope.

22:48.890 --> 22:51.070
Okay, let's just get the
legend and get out of here.

22:51.070 --> 22:52.760
She thinks all this
belongs to her.

22:52.760 --> 22:53.920
Arrogant woman.

22:54.160 --> 22:55.430
I'll check the other room.

22:56.920 --> 22:58.600
You know,
people are getting sicker,

22:58.600 --> 23:01.290
we are stuck here
with that pompous...

23:01.770 --> 23:03.980
Mykes, are you all right?

23:05.690 --> 23:06.560
Yeah.

23:07.600 --> 23:10.300
Okay, so if I was a filthy rich...

23:10.310 --> 23:11.940
possibly a crazy hoarder who...

23:11.940 --> 23:13.750
likes old Counts...

23:13.750 --> 23:15.330
- where would I...
- Pete?

23:15.490 --> 23:16.110
Yeah?

23:16.110 --> 23:18.870
I think that there is
something we...

23:19.040 --> 23:20.550
may have missed.

23:21.210 --> 23:23.150
You just couldn't stay away,
could you?

23:23.150 --> 23:25.940
If I blow your heart out of your
chest, you think that'll stop you?

23:28.000 --> 23:29.550
I'm going to guess that's Charlotte.

23:34.270 --> 23:35.300
Artie?

23:38.130 --> 23:39.610
Artie, are you in there?

23:40.260 --> 23:41.090
Artie!

23:41.230 --> 23:42.520
Artie, I'm coming in.

23:50.180 --> 23:51.790
Artie!

24:09.690 --> 24:11.450
I warned you not to come.

24:11.990 --> 24:13.200
We were...

24:13.200 --> 24:15.650
trying to save you. We thought...

24:16.210 --> 24:17.660
you were trapped.

24:18.770 --> 24:20.050
Do I look trapped?

24:20.170 --> 24:21.550
I don't want you here.

24:22.210 --> 24:24.340
But you, you...

24:25.680 --> 24:27.130
Are you hiding?

24:27.570 --> 24:30.160
- Artie...
- You'll ruin everything.

24:30.340 --> 24:31.920
What will I ruin?

24:32.330 --> 24:34.380
Do you thing that
you'd get away with it?

24:34.680 --> 24:38.170
Some one ate the last oatmeal
scotchies in the kitchen.

24:42.940 --> 24:44.320
You are not in Barcelona.

24:44.320 --> 24:45.600
There's a world wide pandemic.

24:45.600 --> 24:48.470
That sort of thing brings
a halt to international travel.

24:48.470 --> 24:49.870
They've just shut down the airport.

24:49.870 --> 24:52.140
And you didn't berate them
into taking you anyway?

24:52.150 --> 24:53.540
What an unusual behavior for you.

24:53.550 --> 24:56.250
Your brains all over my walls.

24:56.260 --> 24:58.790
I've tripped the alarm.
The police are on their way.

24:58.900 --> 25:01.190
You and your friends can
explain everything to them.

25:01.190 --> 25:03.240
We are not really
his friends, per se.

25:03.240 --> 25:06.650
The extent which I do not care
cannot be measured.

25:06.800 --> 25:09.030
You just think
you are so much smarter...

25:09.030 --> 25:10.480
than everybody else, don't you?

25:10.480 --> 25:13.230
Well, there is actually quite a
lot of evidence supporting that theory.

25:13.300 --> 25:15.050
Hey dude, I think I...

25:15.050 --> 25:17.710
you know close the piehole
while she's got the...

25:17.880 --> 25:21.400
Charlotte, listen to me, we
are not stealing from you, ok?

25:21.470 --> 25:24.870
We are secret service agents.
We are on a mission...

25:24.870 --> 25:26.220
You are not here to steal?

25:26.900 --> 25:28.190
Then why is the good Professor...

25:28.190 --> 25:30.460
have my precious gold
coins in his pocket?

25:30.460 --> 25:32.490
You know, I found these...

25:32.890 --> 25:34.120
on the floor.

25:34.670 --> 25:35.950
Sloppy, sloppy, Charlotte.

25:35.950 --> 25:40.180
Sutton here is not really
acting on our behalf.

25:40.260 --> 25:44.130
No my dear, Sutton only ever
acts on Sutton's behalf...

25:44.210 --> 25:47.080
which is why his behalf is
being carted off to jail.

25:47.080 --> 25:49.070
You are not going to
turn me over to them.

25:49.070 --> 25:49.900
It's done.

25:49.900 --> 25:52.330
Hey, Mykes, I did it I found
the kill switch for the alarm .

25:52.670 --> 25:54.400
There's no kill switch here.

25:57.790 --> 25:59.200
Bravo!

25:59.290 --> 26:01.060
You two are quite good.

26:01.060 --> 26:02.090
Thank you.

26:05.570 --> 26:07.330
Why'd you do that? I mean...

26:07.330 --> 26:09.950
- not that I'm complaining.
- You're going to have to ask him.

26:11.050 --> 26:13.240
I think he is going
to need a minute.

26:14.150 --> 26:15.090
Artie...

26:15.320 --> 26:17.810
if you stay, you'll be lost
in here forever.

26:17.810 --> 26:19.460
And that's a problem, why?

26:20.180 --> 26:21.430
Things are better in here.

26:21.430 --> 26:23.600
Things are the way
I want them to be.

26:24.640 --> 26:27.150
- It's not real.
- Real is overrated.

26:27.490 --> 26:30.020
You think this is better
because Leena is here...

26:30.020 --> 26:31.290
but is not safe.

26:31.290 --> 26:33.220
You can't just stay in
here in denial, Artie.

26:33.220 --> 26:35.430
- You have to come put and face...
- No!

26:37.330 --> 26:39.430
Face, face what, Artie?

26:40.060 --> 26:41.440
Leave it, Claudia.

26:41.440 --> 26:43.150
- You'll disappear.
- I know!

26:43.510 --> 26:44.960
That's what I want!

26:44.960 --> 26:46.340
She wouldn't want it.

26:48.100 --> 26:49.470
If I go with you...

26:50.140 --> 26:52.230
then I would have to remember.

26:53.990 --> 26:55.210
I'll remember...

26:56.960 --> 26:58.300
her face...

26:58.430 --> 26:59.670
before...

26:59.780 --> 27:00.910
Artie.

27:02.770 --> 27:03.880
She trusted me...

27:04.430 --> 27:06.200
and she didn't understand.

27:07.860 --> 27:09.960
And then...

27:13.060 --> 27:13.940
No.

27:33.960 --> 27:36.440
Why would you make
me remember that?

27:45.320 --> 27:48.090
So far, there are no confirmed
deaths, but we do know that...

27:48.120 --> 27:50.400
tens, possibly hundreds or
thousands of victims...

27:50.400 --> 27:53.360
have been affected by the
sweating sickness crisis...

27:53.360 --> 27:56.660
The CDC fears devastating
statistics by morning...

27:56.660 --> 27:58.880
there is no question,
we are now witness...

27:58.880 --> 28:01.290
to the worst catastrophe
in recorded...

28:01.290 --> 28:02.660
medical history.

28:02.800 --> 28:05.300
I've been told the President
is about to make a statement...

28:05.300 --> 28:08.310
we go now to the Press Room
at the White House.

28:12.290 --> 28:15.380
Your partner has a
fantastic right hook.

28:15.890 --> 28:18.890
Now, shouldn't we scram
before the police arrive?

28:19.020 --> 28:19.890
No.

28:20.170 --> 28:22.900
Phone call from a crazy lady
on the fancy end of Paris?

28:22.900 --> 28:25.200
I don't think that's a priority
for the gendarme tonight,

28:25.200 --> 28:27.650
what with the whole world
sweating to death and all.

28:27.870 --> 28:29.320
I think we got a minute.

28:29.320 --> 28:30.400
He lied to us, Pete.

28:30.400 --> 28:32.300
No, no, technically,
I did not lie to you.

28:32.300 --> 28:35.290
I have a pretty good eye
for detail, Professor.

28:35.290 --> 28:37.600
Uh, just so you know,
this is very hot.

28:38.400 --> 28:40.960
All that research
that you showed us?

28:40.960 --> 28:44.720
Conspicuously absent were
portrait of the Count.

28:44.720 --> 28:47.010
Not one, and then...

28:47.420 --> 28:48.670
I saw...

28:49.990 --> 28:50.940
this.

28:51.700 --> 28:55.350
You are not an expert on
The count of Saint Germain,

28:55.350 --> 28:59.330
You are
The Count of Saint Germain!

28:59.330 --> 29:00.520
You don't look very well...

29:00.520 --> 29:01.480
Note...

29:01.730 --> 29:04.790
- that he is not denying...
- Mykes, Mykes!

29:10.860 --> 29:12.720
We really should be going, so...

29:12.720 --> 29:14.540
Just tell us the truth.

29:14.740 --> 29:17.510
- You are the Count.
- All right, yes!

29:17.630 --> 29:18.710
I'm the Count.

29:18.990 --> 29:19.750
What...

29:22.070 --> 29:23.620
Okay, okay.

29:23.620 --> 29:25.660
So, you are like...

29:25.660 --> 29:27.740
really, really old...

29:27.740 --> 29:29.400
with a lot more "reallys".

29:29.980 --> 29:32.460
Are you... What are you...
are you, like, a vampire?

29:32.460 --> 29:33.740
Oh, please!

29:33.740 --> 29:35.600
Vampires are for gothic novels.

29:35.740 --> 29:37.540
And apparently
preadolescent girls.

29:37.540 --> 29:40.430
I don't know, I kinda...
I kinda like vampires.

29:40.430 --> 29:41.930
How is that even possible?

29:41.930 --> 29:42.990
Alchemy.

29:42.990 --> 29:44.550
An alchemist used a stone...

29:44.550 --> 29:47.000
a particular stone,
to keep my body from aging.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.460
Oh, great, another artifact
we have to look for.

29:49.470 --> 29:51.850
No, don't bother. Long gone,
so is the alchemist.

29:51.850 --> 29:53.030
So you are...

29:53.270 --> 29:55.060
300 years old?

29:55.060 --> 29:56.630
That's amazing!

29:56.630 --> 29:59.830
519, actually, I moisturize.

30:00.620 --> 30:01.990
So you are hiding?

30:01.990 --> 30:03.890
No, just lying about my age.

30:04.010 --> 30:06.060
And who I am and
where I am from.

30:06.220 --> 30:08.040
I made my way quite
well, actually.

30:08.040 --> 30:11.010
Fortunately, man is just as gullible
today as he was 500 years ago,

30:11.010 --> 30:12.500
but with a smaller vocabulary.

30:12.610 --> 30:13.540
So you became a...

30:13.540 --> 30:16.310
Professor that specializes
in the 1700s.

30:16.310 --> 30:17.470
Write with you know...

30:17.470 --> 30:19.950
and when two Government agents
asked about my ring...

30:20.020 --> 30:21.640
I saw an opportunity.

30:21.640 --> 30:24.080
All this stuff that
Charlotte has, all these...

30:24.080 --> 30:26.670
antiques that are hundreds
and hundreds of years old...

30:26.670 --> 30:28.910
This is yours, and...

30:29.400 --> 30:30.800
you just, what?
want then back?

30:30.800 --> 30:32.520
Exactly, and your legend.

30:32.690 --> 30:34.500
I'm not selfish.
I merely thought...

30:34.500 --> 30:37.460
while we were here I might as
well nick an old memento or two.

30:37.460 --> 30:40.720
Oh yes. Coincidently, all the
gold ones, right, chap?

30:40.720 --> 30:42.650
We didn't find the legend.

30:43.520 --> 30:44.380
You didn't.

30:44.890 --> 30:46.440
I snatched it...

30:46.560 --> 30:50.480
while you two ladies were busy
gabbing about what a cad I am.

30:50.590 --> 30:52.650
- What is this?
- Open it up.

30:54.850 --> 30:57.320
That's the legend Mykes
to the map.

30:57.320 --> 30:59.190
See, I really am trying to help.

31:00.400 --> 31:01.640
Come now.

31:02.020 --> 31:04.240
You've got to be
a tiny bit impressed.

31:04.240 --> 31:08.090
All right, fine,
I am a tiny bit impressed.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.390
- Thank you.
- Yes.

31:10.330 --> 31:12.070
Right then, off to the catacombs!

31:12.080 --> 31:15.080
Stakes high, lives in the balance!
Bla, bla, danger cakes. Shall we?

31:15.110 --> 31:16.180
All right.

31:16.180 --> 31:19.050
Let's get going before Charlotte
kicks her way out of that closet.

31:20.940 --> 31:23.730
So you are really friends
with Marie Antoniette?

31:24.280 --> 31:26.800
Not friends per se.

31:27.140 --> 31:28.540
Well, we were, then we weren't.

31:28.540 --> 31:31.160
The woman seemed to think
I was using her for her money.

31:31.160 --> 31:32.620
And why would she think that?

31:32.620 --> 31:35.060
Probably because
I was using her for her money.

31:35.060 --> 31:36.060
Pretty big haul?

31:36.060 --> 31:37.750
It was going to be my retirement.

31:37.940 --> 31:39.900
Marie's Violet sunrise.

31:39.900 --> 31:41.130
The diamond?

31:42.480 --> 31:44.580
- Oh, my God!
- What, big?

31:45.470 --> 31:47.420
People wrote stories about it.

31:47.420 --> 31:50.740
I wrote two of them.
It was worth untold riches.

31:51.040 --> 31:54.740
Once I had it, no more cons,
I'd be out, but I misjudged.

31:55.120 --> 31:57.140
What do you mean?
you misjudged...

31:59.480 --> 32:01.180
Oh. They bumped uglies.

32:01.190 --> 32:03.800
Some things are eternal.
"A woman scorned..."

32:03.800 --> 32:06.190
No fury to match it.
She tried to have me beheaded.

32:06.190 --> 32:07.530
Rather her thing.

32:07.770 --> 32:08.970
Don't jilt a queen.

32:08.970 --> 32:10.390
I disappeared.

32:10.460 --> 32:13.590
Left everything behind, everything
I'd worked so hard to get.

32:13.970 --> 32:17.530
You mean everything that you fleeced
from all your innocent victims.

32:17.620 --> 32:19.340
I believe that's what I said.

32:19.530 --> 32:21.260
Including my ring, by the way.

32:22.860 --> 32:24.170
Pete, look.

32:29.550 --> 32:32.560
So how do you have a public
funeral without a body?

32:32.780 --> 32:34.850
Marie used one of her servants.

32:35.490 --> 32:38.570
A dear, sweet
boy named Sebastian.

32:38.690 --> 32:41.300
Poor Marie, she wasn't well.

32:41.980 --> 32:43.880
Declining popularity, I heard.

32:45.960 --> 32:47.410
These faces.

32:47.820 --> 32:51.100
This one's Greek, this is Greek,
this is Greek, but this one...

32:51.100 --> 32:52.730
this face is Chinese.

32:53.890 --> 32:55.220
They are all Greek to me.

32:55.220 --> 32:56.210
It's the lock.

32:56.210 --> 32:57.470
Be careful.

32:58.020 --> 32:59.630
Well, I imagine...

32:59.630 --> 33:02.560
one or two of these gentlemen
were sent here by you.

33:02.660 --> 33:04.240
They were all well paid.

33:04.360 --> 33:05.310
Bingo!

33:05.950 --> 33:07.390
How do you even use that thing?

33:07.390 --> 33:09.470
We know what we are doing.

33:11.860 --> 33:12.720
Okay.

33:17.290 --> 33:20.090
Anyone flayed? All safe now?

33:21.030 --> 33:22.230
Yeah, it's clear.

33:29.410 --> 33:32.720
We're the first people in this 
room for hundreds of years.

33:32.920 --> 33:34.780
- It's...
- Impressive.

33:35.140 --> 33:37.430
But also a little creepy.

33:37.500 --> 33:40.140
I mean, it is your tomb.

33:40.520 --> 33:41.840
Pete, the ring.

33:44.740 --> 33:45.770
That's it.

33:51.330 --> 33:52.420
Let's do this then.

34:09.630 --> 34:11.050
What the hell was that?

34:15.969 --> 34:17.159
Pete!

34:18.310 --> 34:21.050
What, is this another one
of Marie's deterrents?

34:21.050 --> 34:23.610
I had no idea she booby-trapped
the whole place!

34:23.610 --> 34:25.389
That woman is so paranoid!

34:27.290 --> 34:29.270
- Let's get the hell out of here!
- Pete!

34:32.130 --> 34:33.260
Look out!

34:34.360 --> 34:35.409
Sutton!

34:36.250 --> 34:37.139
Pete!

34:37.920 --> 34:40.090
- Oh, no. Oh, God.
- Come on!

34:40.530 --> 34:43.520
It's safe over here.
Come on, we gotta get you up.

34:44.110 --> 34:47.989
Oh, that would be nice. I'm 
going a bit numb, and rather quickly.

34:47.989 --> 34:50.400
A poison dart, typical Marie.

34:50.400 --> 34:51.870
We'll find you an antidote.

34:51.870 --> 34:56.060
What, in the catacombs? Myka, 
you're too smart for sentimentality.

34:56.060 --> 34:57.370
There's no time.

34:57.970 --> 35:00.020
I always wondered
if being ageless

35:00.020 --> 35:01.680
meant being immortal.

35:01.900 --> 35:03.160
Apparently,

35:03.160 --> 35:05.670
a poison dart through
the heart will kill me.

35:05.950 --> 35:08.710
That's good to know.
I won't do that again.

35:09.610 --> 35:10.810
You saved me.

35:10.810 --> 35:12.180
Well, as I said,

35:12.450 --> 35:14.950
beautiful women are my fatal flaw.

35:16.130 --> 35:17.710
Go on, use the ring.

35:18.270 --> 35:22.580
I won't have the entire world
upstage my big death scene.

35:22.700 --> 35:24.300
No, no, we can't leave you here.

35:24.300 --> 35:27.190
Are you insane?
I can't resist the poetry.

35:27.480 --> 35:28.990
This is my crypt.

35:29.560 --> 35:30.380
Go.

35:31.860 --> 35:33.410
Save the world.

35:35.790 --> 35:37.030
Sutton?

35:41.200 --> 35:42.100
Pete?

35:52.240 --> 35:53.120
Okay.

36:51.370 --> 36:52.440
Mykes!

36:52.540 --> 36:53.940
we did it, Mykes.

36:55.610 --> 36:57.110
We saved everybody.

37:00.420 --> 37:02.090
Almost everybody.

37:17.860 --> 37:19.580
What did you remember, Artie?

37:19.990 --> 37:21.000
What's wrong?

37:28.010 --> 37:29.310
It wasn't you.

37:30.240 --> 37:32.570
Something got to you.
Something made you do it.

37:34.110 --> 37:35.510
Why is it so dark?

37:36.550 --> 37:37.950
It's reality...

37:38.450 --> 37:40.150
finding its way in.

37:41.230 --> 37:42.590
She brought it.

37:46.930 --> 37:48.400
This isn't real?

37:50.860 --> 37:51.660
No.

38:00.940 --> 38:02.310
I'm sorry, Artie,

38:02.740 --> 38:04.910
but I think a bigger part
of you wants to leave.

38:05.310 --> 38:08.000
In Germany, you said, 
"save me," so I did,

38:08.130 --> 38:11.670
and I'd do it again, and 
again and again and again,

38:11.680 --> 38:13.980
no matter how angry you get.

38:14.400 --> 38:16.990
You gave yourself clues, Artie.

38:18.420 --> 38:19.660
Like this door.

38:21.190 --> 38:23.590
There's no door in
this spot at Leena's.

38:23.810 --> 38:25.950
But it's more than
just a door, isn't it?

38:27.030 --> 38:28.430
It's the way out.

38:28.770 --> 38:32.670
What makes you so sure
you know what's right?

38:33.630 --> 38:35.970
Because I know you,

38:37.110 --> 38:39.240
and I don't think
you're done fighting,

38:39.250 --> 38:40.950
even if you don't know it yet.

38:42.310 --> 38:45.720
It's the fight that matters, 
Artie. Now go!

38:48.670 --> 38:50.460
- No!
- Yes!

38:58.600 --> 39:00.000
I'm sorry.

39:22.020 --> 39:23.180
Claudia, listen to me.

39:23.180 --> 39:24.920
There was nothing
more we could have done.

39:24.920 --> 39:26.320
- We tried...
- Hey.

39:26.590 --> 39:27.590
Where's Artie?

39:27.600 --> 39:28.960
Mrs. Frederic said, "He was awake".

39:28.960 --> 39:31.360
He is. Claudia brought him back.

39:32.300 --> 39:34.030
Clau... Claudia?

39:35.580 --> 39:37.070
He won't talk to us.

39:37.700 --> 39:39.780
This is going to be harder
than we thought.

39:57.870 --> 39:59.320
Go away.

40:01.530 --> 40:04.030
That's the nice thing about being me.

40:04.840 --> 40:07.170
I don't take orders from you.

40:21.310 --> 40:23.050
Oh, God, what have I done?

40:24.890 --> 40:27.950
- It wasn't you.
- Yeah, but she's still gone...

40:28.590 --> 40:29.960
by my hand.

40:30.890 --> 40:31.890
Yes.

40:34.830 --> 40:37.530
Yes. And how do I fix that?

40:38.870 --> 40:40.080
You can't.

40:40.320 --> 40:41.470
Exactly.

40:43.200 --> 40:44.500
I wish you could,

40:46.630 --> 40:48.710
but there are some things...

40:49.710 --> 40:52.460
Many things...
That cannot be fixed.

40:55.910 --> 40:58.950
You can, however, fix
yourself, if you want to.

41:01.590 --> 41:03.220
I want to fight, but...

41:03.260 --> 41:04.260
Good.

41:05.600 --> 41:07.690
Luckily for you,

41:07.690 --> 41:11.190
there are many smart
people in your life

41:11.880 --> 41:13.330
who love you.

41:13.920 --> 41:15.600
They want to help you.

41:16.430 --> 41:18.110
We'll make it through this...

41:19.000 --> 41:20.510
together. Won't we?

41:25.710 --> 41:27.280
What were you playing then?

42:04.980 --> 42:06.350
Poor Sebastian.

42:08.100 --> 42:10.890
Marie always said you
were honest and loyal...

42:11.930 --> 42:14.590
All the things our
good Count was not.

42:14.730 --> 42:17.200
Hundreds of years, and he
hasn't changed at all.

42:18.330 --> 42:19.700
You're in here.

42:25.640 --> 42:28.090
And my lying, cheating husband

42:28.120 --> 42:30.840
is once again out in the world,

42:30.880 --> 42:33.010
and with Marie's diamond.

42:33.810 --> 42:35.350
But I have plans too.
