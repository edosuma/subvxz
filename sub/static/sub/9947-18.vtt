WEBVTT

00:00.200 --> 00:02.200
Ask why she won't change the boiler.

00:05.120 --> 00:08.599
Anyone who thinks we know fuck all
about owt should watch their back.

00:08.600 --> 00:11.719
So you've had your Labour,
reclassifying skunk,

00:11.720 --> 00:14.919
sending prices sky-high,
literally, literally

00:14.920 --> 00:17.039
taking the grass from its own roots!

00:17.040 --> 00:20.199
And now you've got
your ConDemNation...

00:20.200 --> 00:23.599
Liberals noshing Tories like
altar boys picking dimps up!

00:23.600 --> 00:26.559
Have we had a national fucking
stroke...

00:26.560 --> 00:29.199
Or what?
Is revolution a word...

00:29.200 --> 00:32.359
or was it never?
Anybody watching...

00:32.360 --> 00:37.359
needs to know, we cope better than
average with irony in Chatsworth.

00:37.360 --> 00:39.519
Well, for fuck's sake,

00:39.520 --> 00:43.359
we live in Manchester
and they charge us for water.

00:43.360 --> 00:47.479
I wandered lonely as a clown,
necking mushrooms rarely found...

00:47.480 --> 00:51.999
This green and pleasant land
in ancient times...

00:52.000 --> 00:54.439
yak yak yak yak yak yak yak yak yak!

00:54.440 --> 00:57.759
It's not theirs any more.

00:57.760 --> 01:02.160
This is our England now.
Paaaarty!

01:06.240 --> 01:10.159
Unless you get nicked,
married or sectioned,

01:10.160 --> 01:11.760
nobody can tell you what to do.

01:11.761 --> 01:17.079
I've got three weddings this month,
old mates stepping up, looking tall.

01:17.080 --> 01:20.639
Being in charge. Fiona was sixteen
when she took over this family.

01:20.640 --> 01:24.599
Debbie was about eleven... well...
eleven or twelve. Lip never did,

01:24.600 --> 01:28.639
but only cos he was born
knowing about that kind of stuff.

01:28.640 --> 01:31.520
I'm twenty-one
and never been asked!

01:33.520 --> 01:36.359
Is he sulking?
Is he fuck.

01:36.360 --> 01:39.039
Who my age gives this up for that?

01:39.040 --> 01:41.999
Being a best man is as in charge
as I wanna be.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.479
Micky this, Micky that... Micky who?

01:45.480 --> 01:47.599
Micky Foodchain Ringpiece,
that's who.

01:47.600 --> 01:50.399
I've got nasal sprays, throat sprays,
skin like Grandma's

01:50.400 --> 01:53.759
and I'm wheezing like someone
who's got a note for games.

01:53.760 --> 01:55.559
That only started the day...

01:55.560 --> 01:59.759
exactly the day when they
fitted that new boiler.

01:59.760 --> 02:03.079
Sunday, I burnt a cake
and broke a nail.

02:03.080 --> 02:04.679
Two things in one day.

02:04.680 --> 02:05.640
Just turn it off!

02:05.641 --> 02:07.239
It's freezing.

02:07.240 --> 02:08.078
It's summer.

02:08.079 --> 02:09.560
It's East Manchester!

02:09.561 --> 02:11.719
It can't be fucking hayfever!

02:11.720 --> 02:14.279
Who's fucking arguing?
And stop swearing back!

02:14.280 --> 02:16.160
Ask why she won't change the boiler.

02:16.161 --> 02:19.479
Nobody else is whingeing, cos there's
nothing wrong with the boiler

02:19.480 --> 02:22.639
cos the boiler does exactly
what a boiler is meant to do...

02:22.640 --> 02:24.879
Just like the last one did!

02:24.880 --> 02:26.599
Until the gas chap twigged

02:26.600 --> 02:29.959
we'd piped into next door's
and condemned us with it.

02:29.960 --> 02:31.438
Have we heard? Are they prosecuting?

02:31.439 --> 02:32.600
Nah!

02:32.601 --> 02:36.919
Only turns out his wife's one of me
best clients cos she's a total fuck-up.

02:36.920 --> 02:39.079
Mam!

02:39.080 --> 02:40.560
Micky!

02:42.600 --> 02:45.279
It's me...

02:45.280 --> 02:47.160
or the boiler.

02:55.640 --> 02:57.800
Give us a shout if you
need anything, Cynth!

02:59.880 --> 03:03.679
Back to nearly normal, yes -
two secs!

03:03.680 --> 03:05.239
Bang on cue, missus!

03:05.240 --> 03:08.679
Who the fuck says
"Happy Wedding", you knob!?

03:08.680 --> 03:11.879
All right, so the next time there's
a funeral we just stick up DEAD?

03:11.880 --> 03:16.199
Get this finished, then sort
your kid out... Micky... Fullmoon.

03:16.200 --> 03:17.600
Why? Where?

03:17.601 --> 03:21.160
Talking about moving to Sydney
for good. Upstairs.

03:28.560 --> 03:30.320
Guess who's mam's chucked me out?

03:32.000 --> 03:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:10.280 --> 04:11.560
Shit!

04:26.880 --> 04:28.599
Did you get it out?

04:28.600 --> 04:31.039
Little fuckers. Has Marty gone?

04:31.040 --> 04:32.079
Yeah.

04:32.080 --> 04:35.279
He's in a bit of a rush
so he asked me to give you this.

04:35.280 --> 04:41.079
Took two Pot Snacks, two beans -
bigguns, crackers, teabags - cheapest.

04:41.080 --> 04:44.079
Cheers, Kel.

04:44.080 --> 04:45.719
Why'd you say Sydney?

04:45.720 --> 04:53.039
I didn't. I let "Sitges" slip then flipped
it round to Sydney before Karen twigged.

04:53.040 --> 04:55.759
Bum Boy Barca Sitges?
Cooking in thongs, and that?

04:55.760 --> 04:57.520
And how would you know, Jedward?

04:59.280 --> 05:03.119
Look, don't start,
right, because things got said.

05:03.120 --> 05:05.518
Over a boiler? Are you serious!?
Boiler, what?

05:05.519 --> 05:07.918
You weren't kicked out.
Mum doesn't know you're gone.

05:07.919 --> 05:09.760
She's just seen you taking bags out
for the bins.

05:09.761 --> 05:10.679
Just?

05:10.680 --> 05:13.959
Five hours ago. And they're
not binbags, they're clothes. See!

05:13.960 --> 05:15.200
Micky, go home.
You're sorry, you've calmed down.

05:15.201 --> 05:16.759
Fuck off!

05:16.760 --> 05:19.279
I will literally die.

05:19.280 --> 05:21.319
I'm twenny-six.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.759
You don't flick ears at twenny-six!

05:23.760 --> 05:25.919
Right, couple of nights, tops.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.640
For that, you help us cover
the bar for this wedding do.

05:27.641 --> 05:28.600
Sound.

05:33.280 --> 05:34.960
Shifting already.

05:41.000 --> 05:41.800
Fuck's sake!

05:45.120 --> 05:46.719
Why didn't you open up?

05:46.720 --> 05:49.319
Could've been the filth.

05:49.320 --> 05:52.279
For lifting from Chesney's
and trying to burn his shop down?

05:52.280 --> 05:55.359
They'd come in through the window.

05:55.360 --> 05:57.840
From a skip outside the youth club.

06:00.960 --> 06:03.799
You had company?

06:03.800 --> 06:05.200
Not since you were here last.

06:10.840 --> 06:14.919
I just wanted you to know it'd be
better if you kept your distance.

06:14.920 --> 06:19.199
You said. Last time I saw you.
I know but - safer. It might be safer to...

06:19.200 --> 06:21.279
Cos of Shane? Cos of Shane.

06:21.280 --> 06:23.760
Might get the wrong end
of the stick. Like last time.

06:23.761 --> 06:26.839
Don't want that happening again.
All just a misunderstanding.

06:26.840 --> 06:28.280
Him being the jealous type.

06:28.281 --> 06:30.239
There's nothing to be jealous of.

06:30.240 --> 06:31.240
If there had been.

06:31.241 --> 06:34.559
Possessive, I think.
More than jealous.

06:34.560 --> 06:35.920
He's your husband.

06:35.921 --> 06:37.000
Yeah.

06:38.480 --> 06:42.000
Either way,
best if I kept my distance.

06:44.440 --> 06:45.959
You OK with that?

06:45.960 --> 06:46.680
Have to be.

06:50.920 --> 06:52.319
See you, then.

06:52.320 --> 06:54.439
Yeah.
Look after yourself and stuff.

06:54.440 --> 06:55.839
You too.

06:55.840 --> 06:58.599
Bye.

06:58.600 --> 07:00.080
Bye.

07:30.800 --> 07:32.399
Save your breath.

07:32.400 --> 07:35.439
Them lot'll be over there.
You're on the tables with me.

07:35.440 --> 07:37.559
But I still get to
wear a special t-shirt?

07:37.560 --> 07:39.679
What you going on about, Cynthia?

07:39.680 --> 07:41.560
It's a scratchcard -
you scratch it.

07:41.561 --> 07:43.880
But it doesn't say where.

07:47.000 --> 07:47.960
Lucky me.

07:58.080 --> 07:59.360
Hey up, there you go.

07:59.361 --> 08:02.279
What am I dropping now?

08:02.280 --> 08:04.799
Few chromosomes.
Left. Left foot.

08:04.800 --> 08:08.399
Near the toilets.

08:08.400 --> 08:11.919
Well. Bastards! Send all
your winners to Cheshire pubs, eh!

08:11.920 --> 08:15.239
It's a no, then?

08:15.240 --> 08:20.239
You can't be helped. It's all right,
couple of stitches, it'll mend.

08:20.240 --> 08:22.759
Boss wants a word, Frank.

08:22.760 --> 08:24.679
What, who?

08:24.680 --> 08:27.239
The woman's poorly, you scrubber.

08:27.240 --> 08:30.559
So?! You know she'd be licking it
if I hadn't put the time in!

08:30.560 --> 08:34.879
How in god's name is that not mine?

08:34.880 --> 08:37.519
Go on... fifty each?
You know she will.

08:37.520 --> 08:42.399
She'll have it on her cornflakes,
the pointless old window licker.

08:42.400 --> 08:45.199
I made a speech! Me!

08:45.200 --> 08:47.479
You said they were posh.

08:47.480 --> 08:50.360
I said they had money.
You watch 'em drink!

09:03.200 --> 09:04.240
OAPS...

09:11.840 --> 09:12.960
Cynthia!

09:30.920 --> 09:33.679
More voddy, less red.

09:33.680 --> 09:34.560
Not gonna get changed?

09:34.561 --> 09:37.919
In my family, first thing a bride
sees when she walks into church...

09:37.920 --> 09:41.280
Aisle. Altar. Hymn.

09:44.080 --> 09:46.519
Mam!

09:46.520 --> 09:47.200
Maaaaam!

09:57.880 --> 10:00.039
Someone get her a big drink
on me!

10:00.040 --> 10:01.200
That's for later.

10:01.201 --> 10:04.000
Someone get her a cardigan, man,
she must be about 60!

10:15.280 --> 10:18.959
None shall fucking sleep
tonight. Right, I'll have...

10:18.960 --> 10:20.759
Easy, money bags.

10:20.760 --> 10:25.919
One of them,
one of them and two of them.

10:25.920 --> 10:28.359
Now, 'ere, 'ere, 'ere! Listen!
Listen!

10:28.360 --> 10:32.239
Listen! Listen!! Right, state
your name and how you're pleading!

10:32.240 --> 10:36.599
There's a banker, a taxpayer
and a little single parent

10:36.600 --> 10:39.000
on housing benefits,
all sitting round

10:39.001 --> 10:42.319
this table with a plate of twelve
biscuits to split between 'em.

10:42.320 --> 10:47.399
Banker's straight in, nabbing eleven
of 'em. Straight in the pocket!

10:47.400 --> 10:50.199
Right... he turns to the
taxpayer and he says...

10:50.200 --> 10:53.200
"Watch that thieving cunt.
Keep an eye on your biscuit, mate!"

10:55.880 --> 10:57.839
Yeah, but while them two are

10:57.840 --> 11:05.119
swapping email addresses,
he's having their laptops.

11:05.120 --> 11:08.039
What the fuck have you been up to?

11:08.040 --> 11:09.360
Yeah... it's me!

11:13.760 --> 11:16.520
I'd fuck off Frank,
before they eat you.

11:27.920 --> 11:32.559
North Manchester Police today
confirmed that gun crime levels

11:32.560 --> 11:34.479
were at their lowest since 1998.

11:34.480 --> 11:39.599
Tonight a pensioner was brutally
assaulted in her home in Belvedere Road.

11:39.600 --> 11:43.079
Detectives found traces of new green
paint close to the crime scene...

11:43.080 --> 11:45.679
possibly from footwear...

11:45.680 --> 11:49.439
and they urge anyone with information
to call their confidential helpline

11:49.440 --> 11:54.239
on 08081 570 999.

11:54.240 --> 11:55.240
Cynthia!?

11:55.241 --> 11:57.280
Frank.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.919
Police have this morning confirmed
that the pensioner

12:09.920 --> 12:12.280
violently assaulted in her home
in Belvedere Road

12:12.281 --> 12:13.959
is Miss Cynthia Rose Feltz.

12:13.960 --> 12:15.880
Miss Feltz was found
when a neighbour...

12:15.881 --> 12:18.519
We must fight crimes like this
with zero tolerance...

12:18.520 --> 12:20.398
Miss Feltz, who has no next of kin,

12:20.399 --> 12:22.840
was thought to have been carrying
a large sum of money.

12:27.640 --> 12:29.080
Here you go, Frank.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.799
Cheers, Stafford!

12:32.800 --> 12:36.719
Don't forget fat's the new black,
so you'll be laughing with Babs.

12:36.720 --> 12:38.799
I'll walk from here.

12:38.800 --> 12:44.639
I've got a medical this afternoon
so it'll help if I look fucked.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.279
Fuck off, dickhead.

12:46.280 --> 12:48.760
Full English when anybody's ready.

12:54.480 --> 12:56.078
Who disappeared after
Cynthia went home?

12:56.079 --> 12:57.360
Everybody, eventually.

12:57.361 --> 13:01.399
Frank. And who got refused credit
before he left here, lagging?

13:01.400 --> 13:04.359
Jamie, Frank's a lot of
things but he's not that.

13:04.360 --> 13:06.480
Yeah? Who tried nicking
her scratchcard swag

13:06.481 --> 13:09.159
before she knew she'd won?
He left lagging and cadging...

13:09.160 --> 13:13.479
Yeah, and then bounced back later
chucking twenties about? Frank!

13:13.480 --> 13:15.558
He'll be a lot of things in a
dozen bags when I find the nonce.

13:15.559 --> 13:16.998
Jamie, speak to him.

13:16.999 --> 13:18.760
And don't give it that on Facebook

13:18.761 --> 13:21.879
because you know nothing,
and it's Frank's name on the line.

13:21.880 --> 13:23.439
Yeah, and his head.

13:23.440 --> 13:25.879
Like you've never robbed purses?

13:25.880 --> 13:28.759
Yeah, but not since school.
There's lines you don't cross.

13:28.760 --> 13:31.280
The poor cow's retarded,
and raspberries is a no-no.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.479
Patty. Last night, where'd you
and Frank been before the Jockey?

13:40.480 --> 13:45.079
Excuse me! Last night
I went line dancing on my tod,

13:45.080 --> 13:47.118
being ignored or insulted,
as per usual.

13:47.119 --> 13:49.840
Somebody said they saw you in a taxi
together laughing your tits off.

13:49.841 --> 13:51.959
I was waiting for the last bus

13:51.960 --> 13:55.479
from line dancing.
Frank rolls up in a taxi.

13:55.480 --> 13:57.878
I'm not quick enough,
so he drags us in.

13:57.879 --> 14:00.320
Couldn't understand
a word the man said,

14:00.321 --> 14:02.079
and happy to be with him

14:02.080 --> 14:05.839
only until his money ran out
and I had to buy me own drinks.

14:05.840 --> 14:08.359
Then I shot to the buffet.

14:08.360 --> 14:10.839
So where did his money come from?

14:10.840 --> 14:12.999
Well, he wouldn't know, never has!

14:13.000 --> 14:14.559
Hence me thinking,

14:14.560 --> 14:18.559
it's either fighting or gambling,
to explain the big spender.

14:18.560 --> 14:21.919
But he didn't have a bruise on him,
the gimp.

14:21.920 --> 14:24.479
'Male Maguires should be banned'

14:24.480 --> 14:26.639
from ever thinking in pairs,
they're lethal!

14:26.640 --> 14:28.679
And you're dafter than them
for listening to it!

14:28.680 --> 14:30.279
Kelly, I saw it. Ask Shane!

14:30.280 --> 14:33.359
We had to practically stop Frank
from nicking her prize card.

14:33.360 --> 14:36.239
So? He'd nick prams
if he didn't hate babies.

14:36.240 --> 14:37.198
Don't make him a granny-basher.

14:37.199 --> 14:38.678
He left straight after her

14:38.679 --> 14:40.640
and was back buying
doubles and bubbles.

14:40.641 --> 14:44.079
Is it in there? The Cynthia
thing off the radio? Give it here.

14:44.080 --> 14:46.000
Take the freebie.

14:54.560 --> 14:58.160
Have you ever seen
a barrel scraped so low?

14:59.840 --> 15:01.840
Literally can't give 'em away.

15:10.921 --> 15:13.999
35 rental. 50 deposit.
They're keeping the lot

15:14.000 --> 15:17.840
because somebody got fucking
green paint on it! What?

15:22.720 --> 15:27.279
Medics had to resuscitate her
in the ambulance.

15:27.280 --> 15:31.239
Hiya, Avril. Mam, Kell's
still round there with Lady Gaga,

15:31.240 --> 15:33.159
so I haven't locked up.

15:33.160 --> 15:39.319
I want this on the streets
and round your mates.

15:39.320 --> 15:42.399
Mimi Maguire is putting up a grand

15:42.400 --> 15:44.800
for the name of the fucker
who did this.

15:44.801 --> 15:47.479
You serious? A grand?

15:47.480 --> 15:50.440
You don't even like her.

15:58.240 --> 16:02.279
I'm organising a whip-round
for Cynthia, poor cow.

16:02.280 --> 16:06.679
Door to door, the lot. Cos we
want everyone chipping into this.

16:06.680 --> 16:08.920
Not in here, Frank.
We've already got one on.

16:12.080 --> 16:14.079
Carl...

16:14.080 --> 16:16.679
Just a five. Ten! Till Thursday-ish.

16:16.680 --> 16:18.120
C'mon. Fucking...

16:37.840 --> 16:40.959
Fuck, that's me bus fare.

16:40.960 --> 16:42.840
I've got a fucking medical,
which is...

16:42.841 --> 16:44.879
Thought you were just
taxis these days, Frank.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.360
Leave it, Butch.

16:48.640 --> 16:50.000
Yes, Kel?

16:50.001 --> 16:53.199
Er, chilli and chips
and a vodka tonic.

16:53.200 --> 16:54.320
Bring it over.

16:54.321 --> 16:55.359
Thank you.

16:55.360 --> 16:57.720
All right, Frank.

16:59.600 --> 17:00.800
Hiya.

17:14.040 --> 17:16.598
If they think you're with me,
nobody'll touch your car.

17:16.599 --> 17:17.960
I'm safe.

17:26.960 --> 17:29.759
Sorry, Frank, yours is here, mate.

17:29.760 --> 17:33.039
You didn't leave
a mobile phone, did you?

17:33.040 --> 17:37.799
Er, if it's got credit on it,
it's probably mine.

17:37.800 --> 17:40.120
You're Cynthia Feltz's employers,
is that right?

17:40.121 --> 17:42.879
Give her a few bob every now
and again to keep her busy.

17:42.880 --> 17:43.998
Look, if this is bad news...

17:43.999 --> 17:45.600
Relax. She proved us all wrong

17:45.601 --> 17:48.199
and regained consciousness
an hour or so back.

17:48.200 --> 17:49.599
Has she said who...?

17:49.600 --> 17:52.279
She's not talking yet,
but she seems to know where she is.

17:52.280 --> 17:53.639
She didn't before.

17:53.640 --> 17:57.439
I just meant...

17:57.440 --> 17:59.720
Whoa! Just that she didn't before!

18:04.680 --> 18:05.960
What's the score, then?

18:08.800 --> 18:10.558
What's all this,
people blanking me dad?

18:10.559 --> 18:12.720
They're not very keen
on what he might've done.

18:12.721 --> 18:14.199
As in?

18:14.200 --> 18:16.080
Cynthia.

18:18.040 --> 18:19.920
Cynthia's nothing to do with you,
is she?

18:19.921 --> 18:23.599
Related to that parcel? Fuck off!

18:23.600 --> 18:24.959
No, the kicking.

18:24.960 --> 18:29.439
It's just your name keeps surfacing,
Frank, and it's not just me.

18:29.440 --> 18:32.840
There's others whispering
and I'm picking stuff up.

18:34.400 --> 18:38.839
Fractured skull, broken ribs,
fucked-up windpipe.

18:38.840 --> 18:40.560
Me?

18:41.880 --> 18:44.319
I said I was sorry before I asked,

18:44.320 --> 18:46.480
precisely to avoid this
getting ugly, Frank.

18:48.640 --> 18:50.480
Let you down, did it?

19:01.360 --> 19:05.279
'Your dad's name's coming up too
many times to be guesswork, Carl.'

19:05.280 --> 19:06.200
From who?

19:06.201 --> 19:08.439
Some you know, some you won't.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.598
But too many want to string him up
to ignore.

19:10.599 --> 19:12.560
You're not right in the
fucking head, you lot!

19:12.561 --> 19:14.199
Watch your mouth, Gallagher.

19:14.200 --> 19:16.398
How long've you known him?
When has he ever

19:16.399 --> 19:17.638
laid into anybody round here?

19:17.639 --> 19:19.078
What, discounting his kids?

19:19.079 --> 19:20.560
You never twatted your own?

19:20.561 --> 19:23.320
And if that's a no, do shit-thick
wankers run in your family?

19:30.560 --> 19:31.160
Who the fuck do you think you are,
Maguire?

19:31.161 --> 19:33.160
Whoa! Fucking hell!

19:38.760 --> 19:41.360
You fucking better run, Gallagher!

19:52.080 --> 19:53.719
What you saying about my dad?

19:53.720 --> 19:57.119
Karen Maguire asked me
questions I gave honest answers to.

19:57.120 --> 20:00.239
Pack your bags
and get the fuck out of his house.

20:00.240 --> 20:04.519
Carl, I've repeated nothing
I didn't see with my own eyes.

20:04.520 --> 20:06.200
So where did "coked off his tits"
come from?

20:06.201 --> 20:08.199
I can tell gak from gossip.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.279
This smells a bit off.

20:10.280 --> 20:12.599
'We were back in the Jockey.'

20:12.600 --> 20:16.639
Fuck! I'm on Warfarin, you cunt!

20:16.640 --> 20:21.920
Off his tits, Carl. I swear!

20:25.120 --> 20:28.319
Nobody wants your dad
involved in this.

20:28.320 --> 20:30.639
But you need to see what
we've been looking at.

20:30.640 --> 20:32.438
And people don't
speak to me like that.

20:32.439 --> 20:33.238
Where?

20:33.239 --> 20:34.398
Nowhere, actually!

20:34.399 --> 20:35.360
No, where are we going?

20:35.361 --> 20:36.960
Apollo side of Ardwick.

20:43.520 --> 20:45.879
Branson, this is Carl,
a friend and neighbour.

20:45.880 --> 20:48.959
Carl, Branson,
a colleague every third Sunday.

20:48.960 --> 20:51.720
Just show Carl
what I saw earlier, Branson.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.839
This is Frank dancing
outside Panama 2.

20:55.840 --> 20:57.919
Now Cinnamon Street.

20:57.920 --> 20:59.800
It's a bit ropier
than I'd like, but...

21:02.120 --> 21:06.639
Round that corner's
where Cynthia lives, right?

21:06.640 --> 21:10.079
And 62 minutes later,
coming back this way.

21:10.080 --> 21:12.160
Hailing a taxi.
Where did he get the money?

21:14.120 --> 21:18.079
I didn't make it up, Carl.
These pictures speak for themselves.

21:18.080 --> 21:19.640
Your dad's in deep shit.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.239
So you're experiencing
about two fits a month?

21:25.240 --> 21:27.199
Correct.

21:27.200 --> 21:29.680
You still getting pain down
the right of your neck?

21:29.681 --> 21:31.919
Yeah, it's worse, if anything.

21:31.920 --> 21:34.639
Any falling injuries
when you have the fits?

21:34.640 --> 21:35.959
No.

21:35.960 --> 21:37.240
You're what, six foot?

21:37.241 --> 21:40.319
That's a long way to horizontal
without bumps and bruising.

21:40.320 --> 21:43.079
I'm mostly on me arse
when they strike.

21:43.080 --> 21:45.759
So what's this lot?

21:48.720 --> 21:51.279
The fuck?!

21:51.280 --> 21:56.319
Well, if you're surprised, I don't
know what the wife's gonna think.

21:56.320 --> 21:57.960
When you've got dressed, you can go.

22:26.960 --> 22:28.519
Oy!

22:28.520 --> 22:30.640
Dad!

22:38.240 --> 22:39.478
If you help us shift a bit of
furniture for a mate,

22:39.479 --> 22:40.520
there's a tenner in it for you.

22:40.521 --> 22:42.600
Tell him it's 20 or he's had it.

22:48.360 --> 22:50.840
No, sack that. Not in here.

23:03.040 --> 23:04.320
You all right?

23:15.361 --> 23:17.520
Smoke if you want.

23:57.200 --> 24:00.359
I got up and sang a top notch
version of that at

24:00.360 --> 24:03.079
Manny Holden's pre-trial party.

24:05.680 --> 24:10.959
We'd been on mushrooms his
twisted wife had brewed up for us...

24:10.960 --> 24:14.119
just twatted,

24:14.120 --> 24:16.919
totally twatted...

24:22.920 --> 24:25.399
I couldn't believe me eyes when

24:25.400 --> 24:31.119
they played that tape at his wake
when he copped-out at Strangeways.

24:31.120 --> 24:32.360
Dad.

24:32.361 --> 24:37.479
Hang on. A) I can't remember a thing

24:37.480 --> 24:40.159
about that night with the
mushrooms, Manny and the singing.

24:40.160 --> 24:43.959
Not just as in normal "can't"

24:43.960 --> 24:47.279
like waking up in Fallowfield
between that

24:47.280 --> 24:49.719
fat, black, spotty bird and her mam.

24:49.720 --> 24:51.920
I mean...

24:53.320 --> 24:56.919
There on stage

24:56.920 --> 25:03.160
like belting Fix You out...

25:05.760 --> 25:08.880
which still scares me shitless
because, B)...

25:11.040 --> 25:13.440
I couldn't sing it sober
if I tried.

25:19.720 --> 25:22.320
I didn't think I was capable.

25:25.360 --> 25:30.679
If it was you and I've to
hear it from anyone else,

25:30.680 --> 25:32.599
that'd be us finished.

25:32.600 --> 25:34.080
You know that, don't you?

25:42.560 --> 25:45.160
And I haven't a fucking
clue where I got these.

25:50.160 --> 25:51.760
What we gonna do with me, Carl?

25:51.761 --> 25:54.600
If they've to come and fetch you,
there's three years' difference.

25:55.440 --> 25:57.799
Out of how many?

25:57.800 --> 25:58.760
Says five to seven on the web.

26:02.600 --> 26:04.800
Jesus wept!

26:06.040 --> 26:10.439
I can't. I can't, I can't! I can't
do time again, Carl.

26:10.440 --> 26:13.239
Not at my age.

26:13.240 --> 26:16.999
Nobody leaves you alone...

26:17.000 --> 26:18.120
It'll crucify me.

26:42.880 --> 26:45.639
In all seriousness, I reckon your
arse is fine smelling like that.

26:45.640 --> 26:48.239
Fuck me arse, we've all sold arses!

26:48.240 --> 26:53.679
But nowadays it's random drug
tests so you can't take a piss

26:53.680 --> 27:00.440
without literally grassing yourself
up. What else is there?

27:13.000 --> 27:13.920
Come on, Dad.

27:16.920 --> 27:20.200
Come on. I'm coming with you.

28:01.520 --> 28:03.359
I'm here to hand meself in.

28:03.360 --> 28:06.039
Commencing interview with
Vernon Francis Gallagher,

28:06.040 --> 28:09.519
on charges of burglary, common theft
and causing grievous bodily harm

28:09.520 --> 28:11.479
to Mrs Cynthia Feltz.

28:11.480 --> 28:15.119
Attending Officers DI Carroll,
DC Sheridan, with Mr Ashton Strang

28:15.120 --> 28:19.240
from duty legal
services representing the defendant.

28:20.520 --> 28:21.919
Slept OK, Frank?

28:21.920 --> 28:24.079
Not three hours.

28:24.080 --> 28:27.319
Hopefully see you through
till teatime, though, eh?

28:27.320 --> 28:29.560
And sleep's the great healer so
how's that voice coming along?

28:29.561 --> 28:31.679
Wrong man or Fifth Amendment

28:31.680 --> 28:34.839
that's all you're
getting cos it's all I've got.

28:34.840 --> 28:38.719
Forensics rustled a few new words
up for you, Frank.

28:38.720 --> 28:43.279
Scene of crime. DNA. Positive match.

28:43.280 --> 28:48.200
Prisoner 1052, Gallagher,
Vernon Francis.

28:50.680 --> 28:53.160
Get your head down while
we proof your press release.

28:56.440 --> 28:58.600
Interview terminated 13:52.

29:15.120 --> 29:17.240
Police today named their prime
suspect in the attack on

29:17.241 --> 29:20.159
the Beswick pensioner,
76-year-old Cynthia Feltz...

29:20.160 --> 29:22.639
at her home late Thursday night...

29:22.640 --> 29:24.440
Francis Vernon Gallagher from
neighbouring Chatsworth Estate...

29:24.441 --> 29:28.079
was formally charged with actual
bodily harm and remanded

29:28.080 --> 29:30.559
into custody after...

29:30.560 --> 29:31.880
magistrates denied his
application for bail.

29:31.881 --> 29:34.080
Three and four...

29:36.080 --> 29:37.719
Where's Frank? Where is he?

29:37.720 --> 29:39.480
Where is he? Where is he?

29:41.200 --> 29:42.278
Where is he?

29:42.279 --> 29:43.360
I don't know where he is.
I don't know.

29:45.680 --> 29:47.280
The Officer in charge of the case,
Detective Inspector Clarice Carroll,

29:47.281 --> 29:50.799
confirmed police are pursuing...

29:50.800 --> 29:52.080
no further leads in connection
with the crime

29:52.081 --> 29:53.640
at the time of this report.

30:09.920 --> 30:11.400
Yeah, that's right!

30:11.401 --> 30:15.759
If you're gonna chain-smoke five
in a row, spend a lot more on 'em.

30:15.760 --> 30:17.958
And I'm booking three health
and fitness reviews for

30:17.959 --> 30:19.800
eight in the morning.
Back to your desks.

30:28.480 --> 30:31.080
I've just remanded your dad
on positive DNA samples.

30:34.280 --> 30:37.760
You know he didn't do it.
I can tell.

30:39.240 --> 30:42.639
If he swears he never set
foot in Cynthia Feltz' home,

30:42.640 --> 30:46.279
how come his DNA was
found in her living room?

30:46.280 --> 30:50.200
Old lady beaten literally
half to death, Carl.

31:06.440 --> 31:08.639
Stella! Stella!

31:08.640 --> 31:11.120
Carl! Avril's got her next door.

31:13.280 --> 31:15.399
They nearly hit us with that.

31:15.400 --> 31:17.159
These were local, Carl.

31:17.160 --> 31:18.480
My old boyfriend.

31:20.280 --> 31:22.800
I've an ex works for Novotel.

31:23.080 --> 31:24.360
We live here.

31:26.240 --> 31:27.560
We've done nothing wrong.

32:22.960 --> 32:24.639
Hey, it's not a soup kitchen!

32:24.640 --> 32:25.800
We've a system.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.359
Get off!

32:36.360 --> 32:38.160
Carl! Aaah!

32:39.960 --> 32:41.600
Carl! What are you...

32:51.160 --> 32:52.200
Where's your kid?

32:52.201 --> 32:54.079
What's a your kid?

32:54.080 --> 32:55.318
Your kid, Kev.

32:55.319 --> 32:56.558
I need to speak to Kev now.
Where is he?

32:56.559 --> 32:58.278
Carl, dragging me out
in the street looking like

32:58.279 --> 33:00.400
Life Of Brian's
mum isn't how you ask for a favour!

33:00.401 --> 33:03.319
Kelly. If you fuck me about,

33:03.320 --> 33:06.120
I'll dump you on a roundabout
and set fire to your blanket.

33:07.520 --> 33:10.279
He's in Nottingham. But what
good's that without a postcode?

33:10.280 --> 33:13.199
And why the fuck would I
keep a postcode in a blanket?

33:13.200 --> 33:15.920
What do you want him for?

33:22.640 --> 33:24.199
Well, I'm not walking back.

33:24.200 --> 33:27.040
You'll have to go and get my stuff.

33:36.400 --> 33:40.560
Tell her she's in big
bother for this! Cheeky thing.

33:42.040 --> 33:44.160
It's over a year old, I don't
know whether... Hello?

33:45.520 --> 33:46.840
That's not Veronica, is it?

33:46.841 --> 33:49.280
I'm trying to reach Kev Ball.

33:50.200 --> 33:51.600
Kevin Ball.

33:53.480 --> 33:54.800
And where's work?

34:08.080 --> 34:09.998
Yo! Phone!

34:10.000 --> 34:11.360
Yeah.

34:17.239 --> 34:18.600
Before you start, the kids used

34:18.601 --> 34:20.079
'all the hot water.'

34:20.080 --> 34:21.199
Kev.

34:22.440 --> 34:23.520
It's Carl

34:24.840 --> 34:26.639
Carl Gallagher.

34:26.639 --> 34:28.639
Give over!

34:28.639 --> 34:30.559
That's more Tom Waits.

34:30.560 --> 34:31.880
'What happened to Tin Man?'

34:34.840 --> 34:36.120
What's up, Carl?

34:38.000 --> 34:38.880
Carl?

34:41.120 --> 34:42.319
'Carl?'

35:17.840 --> 35:19.520
No, it's a ginger bloke.

35:28.440 --> 35:30.359
Wow!

35:30.360 --> 35:31.719
Who's tidied you up?

35:31.720 --> 35:33.479
Who missed you out?!

35:33.480 --> 35:36.399
All right, Kev?

35:36.400 --> 35:37.480
Size of this!

35:42.840 --> 35:45.479
Wow.

35:45.480 --> 35:48.279
Swear to God right,
his 13th birthday,

35:48.280 --> 35:51.199
he looked way too weird
to have going-out clothes.

35:51.200 --> 35:53.839
You actually said it, when
I couldn't blow me candles out.

35:53.840 --> 35:55.679
Only cos they were Silk Cuts!

35:55.680 --> 35:58.360
Jesus, Frank!
Where've they had you, Guantanamo?

36:01.400 --> 36:06.239
Sorry, love, ignore me.
It's just me sense of humour.

36:06.240 --> 36:07.599
I'm Kev.

36:07.600 --> 36:09.560
Patricia. Patty.

36:12.160 --> 36:15.279
Whoa! Don't need to ask
who your dad is, do I?

36:15.280 --> 36:17.720
Stop there, cos he doesn't.

36:21.440 --> 36:23.239
Who? Cynthia Feltz.

36:23.240 --> 36:25.319
Dinner lady they sacked
from St Ted's.

36:25.320 --> 36:27.640
Kept turning up in her pinny
with no knickers on.

36:27.641 --> 36:30.839
Little Cynth? How old now?

36:30.840 --> 36:33.479
Mental age barely double figures
with the mirror,

36:33.480 --> 36:36.599
God bless the specimen, but...

36:36.600 --> 36:38.959
77 this coming Saturday.

36:38.960 --> 36:41.639
Who the fuck'd try nailing Frank
for a stunt like that?

36:41.640 --> 36:44.199
Look. I'm right, though,
aren't I, Kev?

36:44.200 --> 36:48.319
I remember me and Debs fetching you
and me dad butties and stuff

36:48.320 --> 36:50.600
helping him on a job
round Cynthia's house.

36:50.601 --> 36:52.679
Soz, Carl.
That's not how I remember it, mate.

36:52.680 --> 36:55.519
You said on the phone. You did.
Debbie's kept receipts.

36:55.520 --> 36:58.119
I said on the phone
I'd worked on the house.

36:58.120 --> 36:58.920
Yeah, with me dad!

36:58.921 --> 37:00.239
Yeah.

37:00.240 --> 37:02.639
In his dreams, the bedridden gonk!

37:02.640 --> 37:06.399
'He'd buggered off with half my tools
and a brand-new step ladder,

37:06.400 --> 37:09.679
'which I was fairly chilled about
cos he'd nicked 'em from me

37:09.680 --> 37:13.359
'before and forgotten who from, so he
always tried selling 'em back to me.

37:13.360 --> 37:15.320
'Comes around, goes around, y'know?'

37:15.321 --> 37:18.700
I only went round to Fuzzy
Feltz's cos the cheeky twat

37:18.701 --> 37:22.079
was trying to sting her
for 200 quid plus petrol.

37:22.080 --> 37:23.999
Had no fucking car anyway!

37:24.000 --> 37:26.599
Should I be swearing on it?

37:26.600 --> 37:29.319
Phrase it how you like,
long as I get the truth.

37:29.320 --> 37:33.999
It's the truth. Took me a week to
make it liveable for her.

37:34.000 --> 37:39.679
So, Frank Gallagher was physically
inside Cynthia Feltz's living room

37:39.680 --> 37:43.119
when you were present
and clearly able to identify him.

37:43.120 --> 37:47.559
I know, should've got five years for
that!

37:47.560 --> 37:54.480
Look, even if Frank did this...
He just... didn't.

38:04.000 --> 38:05.480
There you are, mate.

38:11.520 --> 38:12.759
Know what?

38:12.760 --> 38:17.679
I looked her right in the eye
till I knew she believed every word.

38:17.680 --> 38:20.759
You know what else? It don't count
for a fucking bean,

38:20.760 --> 38:23.799
because they've still got witnesses
to the scratchcard stunt,

38:23.800 --> 38:27.199
CCTV of him round her patch that
night, and every fucker seen him

38:27.200 --> 38:29.640
flashing big cash at the bar.

38:30.960 --> 38:33.320
He couldn't be more fucked, Carl.

38:43.360 --> 38:44.600
You wanted to see me, Frank?

38:51.960 --> 38:55.559
Frank, c'mon.

38:55.560 --> 38:59.999
Nobody in my team
wants to nail the wrong bloke,

39:00.000 --> 39:02.480
just for public opinion
brownie points.

39:15.480 --> 39:18.279
They think
you're concealing evidence.

39:18.280 --> 39:19.960
I know you are.

39:28.160 --> 39:30.440
I did walk her home.

39:32.240 --> 39:35.160
And I was after her winnings.

39:36.440 --> 39:39.119
My turn.

39:39.120 --> 39:42.279
'I caught her up
after she'd left the Jockey.'

39:42.280 --> 39:43.919
on our secret telly?

39:43.920 --> 39:46.079
Tinker Tailor. Tommy Cooper.

39:46.080 --> 39:49.959
Blue Remembered Hills.
Ronnie Barker. Edge Of Darkness.

39:49.960 --> 39:52.599
Pans People flashing their clouts
to Diamonds And Pearls.

39:52.600 --> 39:53.600
And?

39:54.800 --> 39:55.920
Pearls!

39:55.921 --> 39:59.159
I thought you
were going to say Follyfoot Farm.

39:59.160 --> 40:01.599
Why the fuck would I?

40:01.600 --> 40:02.919
Cos you know I like it.

40:02.920 --> 40:04.760
You fucking watch it then,
can't you?

40:04.761 --> 40:08.039
Look it's like I said,
I'll get my own telly, right?

40:08.040 --> 40:12.839
And you sub me till
an election... the election.

40:12.840 --> 40:15.759
Ask Cynthia properly!

40:15.760 --> 40:16.960
Pleeeease.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.840
Fuck it, I can't do this.

40:21.320 --> 40:24.439
Just tell Cynthia to get back in
her box, the silly old slop rag.

40:24.440 --> 40:25.720
Granted!

40:31.760 --> 40:33.320
Go on.

40:34.800 --> 40:37.399
If it gets any clearer...

40:37.400 --> 40:39.360
I'll be topping meself.

41:26.641 --> 41:28.159
What?!

41:28.160 --> 41:30.040
Tell us something about Frank, Mimi.

41:30.041 --> 41:35.199
Kevin fuck'n Ball! You owe us 30
for weed and six years of interest.

41:35.200 --> 41:37.919
Not twice,
you thieving scouse bastard!

41:37.920 --> 41:38.360
Pint?

41:38.361 --> 41:40.119
Yes.

41:40.120 --> 41:41.719
You lived here years before me.

41:41.720 --> 41:44.679
Frank Gallagher? Come on.

41:44.680 --> 41:47.279
He hasn't give us
one line of defence.

41:47.280 --> 41:50.039
He shouldn't need to.
Plus I worked here seven years.

41:50.040 --> 41:52.839
Never paid scratch-card
prize money in 20s,

41:52.840 --> 41:56.039
cos before midnight,
some of 'em can still count to five,

41:56.040 --> 41:59.439
but ten tens, count three out before
they've palmed one and they're...

41:59.440 --> 42:00.959
Y'know what I mean?

42:00.960 --> 42:02.999
Plus, Frank was paying in 20s,
wasn't he?

42:03.000 --> 42:04.280
Is this on the house? Ta.

42:04.281 --> 42:06.999
Y'all right, Monroe, how's it going?

42:07.000 --> 42:09.320
Actually, I was in the shower
this morning, going,

42:09.321 --> 42:12.720
"Things are looking..." Y'know when
everything looks more colourful?

42:14.240 --> 42:16.280
If Shane's laid a finger on you,
now is the time to say.

42:16.281 --> 42:18.039
What? Give over.

42:18.040 --> 42:21.199
Twice with oven gloves
cos I'd blow him off if he did!

42:21.200 --> 42:22.720
So that's a Man B.

42:26.920 --> 42:28.120
Marty.

42:30.440 --> 42:33.560
Mar... Marty?! Are you stuffing
crack up your crack, Kel?

42:35.360 --> 42:37.480
Marty is me, Kev.

42:40.720 --> 42:42.080
Myrna? Did you get it for us?

42:42.081 --> 42:43.679
Marty? Marty...?

42:43.680 --> 42:45.839
No, hang on, hang on! Pen.

42:45.840 --> 42:46.320
Pen, pen!

42:46.321 --> 42:48.640
Right! Got a pen?

42:51.280 --> 42:52.880
Right, go on.

42:54.360 --> 42:55.760
Brilliant.

43:01.160 --> 43:03.320
'Tell 'em thanks
for the collection.'

43:04.560 --> 43:06.599
'Erm... and...'

43:06.600 --> 43:08.640
Jamie. Borrow you a sec?

43:10.120 --> 43:11.759
This's Saturday's takings.

43:11.760 --> 43:14.319
The only person drinking
Flip-Flops was Patty.

43:14.320 --> 43:16.479
The only person paying was Frank.

43:16.480 --> 43:18.959
He spent way more than Cynthia lost.

43:18.960 --> 43:21.959
And between 'em, they spent
more than that on scratchcards!

43:21.960 --> 43:24.639
What, he couldn't have gone
under her floorboards for more?

43:24.640 --> 43:26.320
Plus, we paid her in tens.

43:28.800 --> 43:30.359
Frank was blowing 20s.

43:30.360 --> 43:33.519
Now then, I'll have one of them.

43:33.520 --> 43:35.079
It wasn't her money.

43:35.080 --> 43:36.440
Karen?

43:42.720 --> 43:43.760
Yeah?

43:43.761 --> 43:46.079
Can you come and look
at something for us?

43:46.080 --> 43:49.839
'Erm...ears waxed.

43:49.840 --> 43:52.639
'And de-loused...

43:52.640 --> 43:57.359
'And they've made me look
absolutely champion down here!'

44:02.480 --> 44:04.280
You didn't leave that in on purpose?

44:04.281 --> 44:05.799
I didn't make her do it!

44:05.800 --> 44:07.680
You showed me this yesterday.

44:07.681 --> 44:10.599
Nah, this is different.
D'you remember Jody Garcia?

44:10.600 --> 44:13.119
Yeah. Yeah, she's piled it on!

44:13.120 --> 44:14.799
Tell me about it.

44:14.800 --> 44:18.919
When I get hold of her number, first
thing I ask is, "When are you due?"

44:18.920 --> 44:20.799
What were you ringing her for?

44:20.800 --> 44:22.879
Well... she was in the queue
for Panama Two

44:22.880 --> 44:25.840
and got Frank on her phone.
He wasn't jigging on his own! Look!

44:29.200 --> 44:31.679
I haven't a clue
who it is, have you?

44:31.680 --> 44:33.680
One of the Macreadys
is dealing that patch.

44:36.200 --> 44:37.919
That's "Growbag" Macready.

44:37.920 --> 44:40.799
He's bunging something
into Frank's pocket,

44:40.800 --> 44:42.640
and it isn't fucking caster sugar!

44:42.641 --> 44:44.999
Which is a lot more believable

44:45.000 --> 44:47.120
as to where Frank got his hands
on that turnover.

44:47.121 --> 44:49.679
Is he working for Growbag?

44:49.680 --> 44:53.800
Grow up! Afghans wouldn't
let Frank run drugs for 'em!

44:57.040 --> 44:58.200
Do you know a Growbag?

44:59.800 --> 45:01.040
Growbag Macready?

45:02.160 --> 45:03.799
I was at school with him. Why?

45:03.800 --> 45:06.000
Watch this.

45:08.080 --> 45:10.199
Why's this good news?

45:10.200 --> 45:12.680
Cos look! He's slipping coke
in me dad's pocket.

45:12.681 --> 45:14.879
Will they let us take it in
to show him?

45:14.880 --> 45:16.719
Will they fuck!

45:16.720 --> 45:19.399
We can't let the police get hold
of this! They'll string him up!

45:19.400 --> 45:20.640
Frank has to see it.

45:20.641 --> 45:22.720
Or we'll be here till the Olympics.

45:39.520 --> 45:41.160
Fucking 'ell, I am in trouble.

45:45.440 --> 45:47.439
Kev Ball?

45:47.440 --> 45:48.800
Your hair looks good.

45:51.080 --> 45:53.519
You, you fucking Harmony hairspray.

45:53.520 --> 45:55.920
Sheriff of fucking Nottingham.

45:57.800 --> 45:59.359
Listen, Frank.

45:59.360 --> 46:02.399
In a sec, not now...

46:02.400 --> 46:05.679
Aidan's going to open his jacket
and show you what's underneath.

46:05.680 --> 46:08.279
Y'got a bit of weed?
Just drop it by me shoe. Drop it.

46:08.280 --> 46:10.799
No, Dad, the nipple.

46:10.800 --> 46:12.240
What?

46:20.720 --> 46:22.879
Argh!

46:22.880 --> 46:24.839
Argh, you fucking thing!

46:24.840 --> 46:27.280
Yes! Yes!

46:29.400 --> 46:31.439
Yes! Growbag!

46:31.440 --> 46:32.520
That's Growbag!

46:32.521 --> 46:35.639
Yeah, we know! But Growbag... what?

46:35.640 --> 46:37.159
He was there.

46:37.160 --> 46:37.840
Dance.

46:37.841 --> 46:41.079
"" He goes,
"Keep fucking dancing, Frank."

46:41.080 --> 46:43.519
I will cut your throat here and now!

46:43.520 --> 46:44.960
What? There's a drink in this.

46:44.961 --> 46:48.879
Just something I need you to look
after for me for a couple of hours.

46:48.880 --> 46:50.158
Cheers, Growbag.

46:50.159 --> 46:51.320
Don't look round.

46:51.321 --> 46:54.879
Cops are milking the overtime
like Chilean fucking miners!

46:54.880 --> 46:55.998
Don't look!

46:55.999 --> 46:57.160
Start walking.

46:57.161 --> 47:00.159
You go straight to the Irish Club...

47:00.160 --> 47:01.360
I'm on an errand.

47:01.361 --> 47:03.399
You go straight to the Irish Club...

47:03.400 --> 47:06.559
No, I'm meant to be
walking her home...

47:06.560 --> 47:11.079
You go straight to the Irish Club
and you stay fucking put

47:11.080 --> 47:12.679
till I turn up.

47:12.680 --> 47:17.879
You don't sell it,
you don't take it, you keep it safe.

47:17.880 --> 47:19.479
Eleven o'clock.

47:19.480 --> 47:20.798
With the coke.

47:20.799 --> 47:21.760
With the dog.

47:21.761 --> 47:25.279
She won't be able
to find her way if...

47:25.280 --> 47:26.400
What dog?

47:26.401 --> 47:31.200
A mad fucking Nazi mutt
trying to hump me senseless.

47:33.040 --> 47:36.919
But I must've got
to the Irish Club as instructed.

47:36.920 --> 47:40.719
I'm here Growbag, when you're ready.

47:40.720 --> 47:42.200
Oops, sorry.

47:42.201 --> 47:45.039
Begging your pardon, miss!

47:45.040 --> 47:48.599
For fuck... What's...?

47:48.600 --> 47:50.000
But I've got a meeting!

47:50.001 --> 47:51.639
What happened with the drugs?

47:51.640 --> 47:55.639
Well, no surprise there,
I can't fucking remember!

47:55.640 --> 47:59.279
But I must've had the nouse to shift
a few bags to pay for the cabaret.

47:59.280 --> 48:00.520
So...

48:00.521 --> 48:04.200
Hey, I'm not the dumb fuck
that everybody makes out, eh?

48:05.840 --> 48:09.439
I've a gone a bit Mandela there.

48:09.440 --> 48:13.599
Hey, and I get me money today, so...

48:13.600 --> 48:14.960
skunk for tea!

48:16.280 --> 48:19.160
Frank, Frank, Frank!

48:20.640 --> 48:23.359
If you didn't walk
Cynthia home, who did?

48:23.360 --> 48:25.359
C'mon, grandma, let's have you.

48:25.360 --> 48:26.719
Where's he gone again?

48:26.720 --> 48:28.999
Keep smiling, sweetheart.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.799
Just walk and keep smiling,
all right?

48:31.800 --> 48:35.800
Good girl. Mushroom, get her home.

48:37.440 --> 48:39.320
Get her home!

48:47.480 --> 48:50.999
H... 'kin 'ell!

48:51.000 --> 48:52.438
But, I wouldn't, would I?

48:52.439 --> 48:53.880
I wouldn't, would I?

48:53.881 --> 48:58.319
Why would... How would I...

48:58.320 --> 48:59.640
I dib in a Macready...

48:59.641 --> 49:02.159
Frankly, Frank,
it's a bit late for that.

49:02.160 --> 49:03.040
No, seriously... don't.

49:03.041 --> 49:05.519
Hang on a minute.
If you've heard all that,

49:05.520 --> 49:07.198
you know
Frank's not in the running for this.

49:07.199 --> 49:09.000
I want it in a written statement.

49:09.001 --> 49:10.639
No, no, that's your noose, Frank.

49:10.640 --> 49:12.239
If you don't, I'll let you go

49:12.240 --> 49:14.239
and you take your chances
with Growbag.

49:14.240 --> 49:14.838
Don't, Dad, seriously.

49:14.839 --> 49:16.040
No way.

49:18.001 --> 49:19.640
All right.

49:20.840 --> 49:23.519
You testify
in both investigations...

49:23.520 --> 49:25.599
Mrs Feltz', Vince Macready...

49:25.600 --> 49:26.600
Who? Growbag!

49:26.601 --> 49:28.879
Which guarantees you
full privileges

49:28.880 --> 49:31.080
of the official
Witness Protection Program.

49:32.360 --> 49:33.958
You've no other option, Frank.

49:33.959 --> 49:34.920
Don't do it, mate.

49:54.720 --> 49:55.760
He's out cold!

50:12.000 --> 50:13.440
What time do you call this?

50:15.800 --> 50:19.199
I've been in a coma ten hours?

50:19.200 --> 50:22.199
You've been knocked out for ten
minutes. The rest you slept through.

50:22.200 --> 50:24.158
St Mary's, if it
makes any difference.

50:24.159 --> 50:26.400
Right...
police guards, and shit?

50:26.401 --> 50:29.479
We're here.

50:29.480 --> 50:32.999
And I'm on full expenses for wotnot?

50:33.000 --> 50:34.559
Y'know, witness thingy.

50:34.560 --> 50:36.000
Frank, fuck off!

50:36.001 --> 50:38.599
As soon as she's done with your
stitches, you're on your own.

50:38.600 --> 50:40.639
Fuck... they'll shred me!

50:40.640 --> 50:42.679
Fucking shred me!

50:42.680 --> 50:45.519
Preventing that is
totally within your power.

50:45.520 --> 50:47.919
Give me a supportable statement,

50:47.920 --> 50:50.238
I'll get CPS to grant
you protected status.

50:50.239 --> 50:52.040
Either way, you're going somewhere

50:52.041 --> 50:55.600
you've never been, so don't
forget your toothbrush, eh, Frank?

51:02.040 --> 51:04.720
Any chance of a nosh, chubbychops?

51:11.560 --> 51:15.799
All right. I give you a phrase,
you give me the name of the book.

51:15.800 --> 51:18.239
'Bright Eyes'.

51:18.240 --> 51:19.919
Most Haunted!

51:19.920 --> 51:24.640
We've no carrots so I'll give
you extra onion gravy, all right?

51:27.880 --> 51:29.920
Pass us an 'onion gravy' Frank.

51:36.000 --> 51:39.599
Who said in which film
'Please Sir, can I have more?'.

51:39.600 --> 51:41.279
Bobby Sands!

51:41.280 --> 51:42.320
Jamie!

51:43.840 --> 51:46.599
Take over, Paxman.
How'd you get here?

51:46.600 --> 51:48.799
Through Highgrove Park.

51:48.800 --> 51:49.598
These should fit.

51:49.599 --> 51:50.678
Fuck off, they're mine!

51:50.679 --> 51:52.640
And that is going nowhere near him.

51:52.641 --> 51:55.159
Oi! This is all down to
you shamrock gobshites.

51:55.160 --> 51:58.799
The least you owe me is
protection, free bar and sustenance.

51:58.800 --> 52:00.640
He's not kicking
me out, the tramp.

52:00.641 --> 52:03.440
This is the first place
the Macready's'll look.

52:10.640 --> 52:12.278
Fucking hell! Osama Bin Deadawhile!

52:12.279 --> 52:14.238
Right Frank in the
shower, for fuck sake.

52:14.239 --> 52:16.560
I'll stick some of Dad's
clothes outside the door.

52:16.561 --> 52:19.759
And Frank, can I say summat
while we're all in one room here...

52:19.760 --> 52:21.720
we're all genuinely
gutted about the rumours and...

52:21.721 --> 52:24.599
And brainless, lethal bullshit.

52:24.600 --> 52:28.279
But I'm telling you, Frank, if you
had done it, you'd be lucky to

52:28.280 --> 52:31.999
be alive. We were only wrong about
you decking a retarded pensioner,

52:32.000 --> 52:34.880
but that's cos you were elsewhere
muling gak for a reptile whose gear

52:34.881 --> 52:39.839
you spunked and never paid for, but
never once was I fingering you...

52:39.840 --> 52:40.880
that was Geoffrey and Bungle here.

52:40.881 --> 52:42.600
Fuck off!

52:50.840 --> 52:54.039
Open the fucking door now!

53:11.600 --> 53:14.799
Where's Frank?
Macreadys are on their way.

53:14.800 --> 53:16.920
Frank's only dead if he's
lucky, I'm telling you.

53:16.921 --> 53:18.359
Get him out the bath.

53:18.360 --> 53:22.560
Gimme your car keys, I'll disappear
Frank. Quicker than that!

53:24.600 --> 53:26.119
Frank, move!

53:26.120 --> 53:28.279
Where the
fuck are you taking me now?!

53:28.280 --> 53:31.639
Just get him in and... in!

53:31.640 --> 53:33.240
Not so fucking rough, Karen!

53:42.000 --> 53:44.358
Just give us enough
for a Holiday Inn then.

53:44.359 --> 53:45.160
Who'd you think you are?

53:45.161 --> 53:47.360
Says the prossie!

54:02.800 --> 54:05.319
Relax. It's a Muslim.

54:05.320 --> 54:09.720
Nah, Ches, come on mate, this is bad
timing this, mate.

54:14.680 --> 54:15.640
Will you chill out?

54:15.641 --> 54:18.799
Seriously, I can't, mate.
I've got Patty and Stella out there.

54:18.800 --> 54:22.279
Where they belong, the tramps.

54:22.280 --> 54:26.039
Light that. She's teaching your
Stella Paddy rebel songs, you know.

54:26.040 --> 54:27.998
We do that, it's fucking Guantanamo.

54:33.200 --> 54:34.400
Scared to go out.

54:34.401 --> 54:37.880
Yeah, I'm not surprised,
with that scraggy old turnip!

54:40.040 --> 54:41.240
Can I say 'turnip'?

54:41.241 --> 54:44.319
Fuck!

54:44.320 --> 54:46.760
Look, stay in your cot!
Two secs!

54:56.640 --> 54:57.999
Where is he?

54:58.000 --> 55:00.599
He'll be ages yet.

55:00.600 --> 55:02.679
These won't last two minutes!

55:02.680 --> 55:04.400
I'll sort you a lift home!

55:06.680 --> 55:08.400
Taxi, please.

55:25.640 --> 55:29.040
You couldn't split a fiver
for the slot machines, could you?

55:29.880 --> 55:31.079
Hiya!

55:31.080 --> 55:32.839
Hello again.

55:32.840 --> 55:34.560
Wow, what a coincidence!

55:37.240 --> 55:39.479
You and the mujidaddists, eh?!

55:39.480 --> 55:41.959
The Jihadists.

55:41.960 --> 55:44.240
You had 'em all sitting
about in your kitchen,

55:44.241 --> 55:47.039
fuckin' singing,
songs you couldn't even remember.

55:47.040 --> 55:47.840
Name one.

55:47.841 --> 55:49.439
Any fuckin' one!

55:49.440 --> 55:53.039
Look I knew plenty of songs...
Just mixed all the words up.

55:53.040 --> 55:56.999
Hey, they've stopped texting.

55:57.000 --> 55:58.519
What've I done?

55:58.520 --> 56:00.160
You serious?

56:01.960 --> 56:05.199
You said they scared you shitless?
You said they were 'lethal'.

56:05.200 --> 56:07.200
Yeah, they are.

56:08.880 --> 56:12.839
All they wanted from me was bulk
Jammie Dodgers at less than cost.

56:12.840 --> 56:15.359
I told 'em to fuck right off!

56:15.360 --> 56:17.519
Standard!

56:17.520 --> 56:22.319
Yes, lad! I know, but look at
all this bleach I'm stuck with!

56:22.320 --> 56:24.839
And who else round here buys bleach?

56:31.480 --> 56:33.039
So where's the helmet?

56:33.040 --> 56:33.959
M?

56:33.960 --> 56:37.319
Chatsworth to here's five A-roads.

56:37.320 --> 56:38.519
Taxi.

56:38.520 --> 56:40.479
To see me?

56:40.480 --> 56:42.080
It was, yeah.

56:43.680 --> 56:46.719
Jump? Or Justice?

56:46.720 --> 56:51.879
Well... I've had a couple of pervy
accidents thinking about the first,

56:51.880 --> 56:54.239
when we met...

56:54.240 --> 56:58.319
But, no, I'm no threat
cos I'm happily married.

56:58.320 --> 57:01.199
Or happily married cos I'm no threat.

57:01.200 --> 57:04.319
Fuck it, you know what I mean,
and hey... just for the record

57:04.320 --> 57:07.399
I'm no pussy-gimp either. But y'know,
Cheers anyway, how are you?!

57:07.400 --> 57:08.800
I'm good.

57:08.801 --> 57:13.400
You're being a bit thick about Frank,
no offence.

57:15.040 --> 57:18.839
Whatever happens,
he's rattling like a vibrator

57:18.840 --> 57:20.679
in a biscuit tin, poor tramp.

57:20.680 --> 57:23.519
He's had it with your
lot if he doesn't make

57:23.520 --> 57:27.719
a statement against Mushroom,
Growbag's hit list if he does.

57:27.720 --> 57:29.839
I don't need to do anything with
Frank,

57:29.840 --> 57:32.279
but wait for him to fall into
prison.

57:32.280 --> 57:34.799
Then why are your
lads still out looking?

57:34.800 --> 57:38.639
For reasons I can't disclose and
in the public's best interest,

57:38.640 --> 57:40.480
I want action sooner than later,
yeah.

57:42.160 --> 57:44.999
We could sort this out...
if you stop being greedy.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.280
Who the
fuck d'you think you're talking to?

57:47.281 --> 57:50.000
Wow. That's just given me a semi.

57:52.720 --> 57:57.559
You can collar Growbag anytime.
You wanna flash your tits upstairs,

57:57.560 --> 58:01.559
bagging Mushroom for attempted murder
and a Drug Swoop. Yeah, they're gonna

58:01.560 --> 58:04.999
love you upstairs, but I'm
begging you, don't orphan Carl.

58:05.000 --> 58:08.119
Being in charge is
crippling the lad,

58:08.120 --> 58:11.040
whose dad, we all know, is innocent.

58:12.880 --> 58:14.600
Please, I'm begging you.

58:16.240 --> 58:18.159
Bagging one Macready

58:18.160 --> 58:23.280
is more than enough to flash tits for
your James Andertons.

58:25.960 --> 58:29.519
What's Growbag's thoughts on that?

58:29.520 --> 58:32.079
You've nothing without Growbag.

58:32.080 --> 58:34.919
And if he can't hand
his brother over,

58:34.920 --> 58:37.759
which he won't, you've nothing.

58:37.760 --> 58:39.880
You've fuck all without Frank.

58:44.800 --> 58:46.119
I can trust you?

58:46.120 --> 58:47.160
Where's Frank?

58:50.280 --> 58:52.480
I don't know how
you coulda missed him!

58:55.000 --> 58:57.239
You two two-faced
useless little twat!

58:57.240 --> 58:59.679
It was me, Frank. Kev did that.

58:59.680 --> 59:01.279
No, I want the full Miranda,

59:01.280 --> 59:03.800
in front of witnesses, every word
or you can fuck off, I'm sticking.

59:03.801 --> 59:05.439
You're not being arrested,

59:05.440 --> 59:07.199
you thick, stinking dicksack!

59:07.200 --> 59:09.599
What does this look like then?

59:09.600 --> 59:12.559
Easy! I'm not a fucking terrorist.

59:12.560 --> 59:14.239
Crowing thrice!

59:14.240 --> 59:16.038
You ginger-haired hanging basket!

59:16.039 --> 59:17.318
I've got me reasons.

59:17.319 --> 59:18.400
Well, I hope you choke on them.

59:18.401 --> 59:20.240
Outside now!

59:29.840 --> 59:32.278
If you're banging her,
I'll bruise you, Kev.

59:32.279 --> 59:32.960
Behave yourself! Oi!

59:32.961 --> 59:34.839
You have, haven't you?

59:34.840 --> 59:35.679
No!

59:35.680 --> 59:36.679
Look at me!

59:36.680 --> 59:39.639
Scouts honour! Dib, dib, dib!

59:39.640 --> 59:43.519
I let her watch me have a wank in the
back of the car, and she let me cum

59:43.520 --> 59:46.399
on her foot, bare foot.
But that's all.

59:46.400 --> 59:49.599
I could've had the lot, but no!

59:59.680 --> 01:00:02.439
He's on his own down her patch,
how is that safer?

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:05.879
Oi, believe me, he's safer
with her if this goes wrong.

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:07.879
Look... Mimi, right,

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:11.519
has got us an appointment
with Growbag in a couple of hours.

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:13.040
Growbag is going to
have to let Mushroom go.

01:00:13.041 --> 01:00:14.919
Not serious?

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:17.999
Frank nails Mushroom in his
statement, cos, c'mon', he has to.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.360
But he doesn't have to testify
against Growbag, which is good news.

01:00:20.361 --> 01:00:22.360
So?! We're back where we started!

01:00:22.361 --> 01:00:25.919
Except now, we've got information
that Growbag seriously needs to hear.

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:29.439
How, where and when the police are
planning their big raid on his patch.

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:30.320
How did we know that?

01:00:30.321 --> 01:00:33.119
From her! Jesus! Come here!

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:37.399
She's got her reasons, apparently.

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.318
No, no, no, Carl, you're not coming.

01:00:39.319 --> 01:00:41.640
I've been talking to dealers
since I was in year three.

01:00:41.641 --> 01:00:44.239
Not ones connected to three
murders that we know of.

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:47.439
Carl, if shit's going round
about your dad, and it will,

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:50.159
and you hit the ceiling
and it all kicks off,

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:52.440
we're gonna end up buried
under a scrapyard somewhere.

01:00:52.441 --> 01:00:54.599
Right and if you come back saying

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:58.359
'I did my best, but it's a no'
then Kev, I'll blame you.

01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:01.839
Shift it! In the car!
He's fetched us forward an hour.

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:04.680
How much are you ordering
and what's your best price?

01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:10.478
Look, Mimi, right,
there's been a change of plan.

01:01:10.479 --> 01:01:11.640
Fuck off!

01:01:11.641 --> 01:01:15.039
My dad's looking at five to seven if
Growbag doesn't turn their kid in.

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.919
He worships his little brother.

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:18.400
Then we'll have to persuade him.

01:01:18.401 --> 01:01:21.960
No! Fuck off, he'll have your
necks on a butty.

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:27.519
You can't just change your mind!
We've arranged everything!

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:28.720
What, Carl?!

01:01:28.721 --> 01:01:31.359
You're not gonna look so
buxom if this gets round!

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:34.039
Ma Maguire's lost her bottle.
What's that gonna cost you?

01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:35.639
Shut your yap!

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:38.279
I'm going. Thing's
have been a lot quieter round here

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:40.319
since you and Hindley fucked off!

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:43.359
Right, I'll meet you on
the corner of Springhill.

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:46.839
And it's just me and Mimi
doing the talking? Promise kiddo?

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:48.960
Promise?!

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:08.479
Jesus!

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:12.199
Quieter round here without me,
is it!?

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:15.160
I'm one of your own, you daft twats!

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:17.680
Fuck!

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:24.320
Come on, Carl, come on!

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:32.719
I was seeing her home, and yeah,
cadging, but no harm intended.

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:36.479
And I walked her as
far as Panama two's...

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:49.480
Yeah?

01:02:49.481 --> 01:02:51.999
'Me getting
to the Irish club's gone tits up'.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.360
Say again... what went wrong?

01:02:53.361 --> 01:02:55.599
'Me. The bike'.

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:59.639
'No cars with four wheels or a
body in the fucking boot. Help!'

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:01.759
Second right, then second left.

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:04.999
No, wait. One. Two.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.239
Three. Did I say two? So then it's
three. Is it?

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:11.519
Where's your thingy?! Your woman?!

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:12.920
It got robbed. Second or third?

01:03:12.921 --> 01:03:16.479
Remind me to get our Shane to fix
you up with a cheap-ish one, on me.

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:18.839
It'll be mine anyway. Two or three?

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:20.439
Who'd need more than one?

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:24.239
Fucking turnings! Second or third?!

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:26.760
Third!

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:33.040
Where's Kev?

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.320
Turn round, Carl.

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:41.360
Fucking turn round!

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.160
All right?

01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:03.399
Fuck you! Get fucked,
you big dumb fluffer!

01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:05.359
Give us a bottle!

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:10.839
Come on! And I'll slice your fuckin'
skittle down to clinical average.

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:13.519
Do you mind?!
My daughter's fucking dancing!

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:15.519
Fuck off!

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:18.720
Double vodka and a shot of Martini.
Snacks if you want.

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:28.320
Undo their wheel nuts.

01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:34.200
What's happening now?
Is Kev kicking off?

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:45.320
How's it hanging, D-I-Y-O-Y?

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:52.879
If that's undercover,
I'm Jeremy fucking Beadle.

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:54.000
Who've you brought?

01:04:54.001 --> 01:04:55.560
No-one.

01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:58.839
I'm here, because I realise

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:01.839
your other meeting's
pointless without me.

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:05.719
Mimi, Carl, Kev Ball...

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:09.600
When you hear what we've got to
say, you'll regret all your threats.

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:14.960
Private.

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:30.799
You brainless two-faced cow,
what are yous doing here?!

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:33.039
What did I tell you?

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:36.079
A filthy ten-incher in a skirt.

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:39.120
None of us wants this any of this
overheard. Least of all you.

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:48.040
This bit can only come from you,
mate. Come on.

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:55.879
Cynthia...

01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:57.120
I had nothing to do with that.

01:05:57.121 --> 01:05:58.959
Your Mushroom did.

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:04.119
Mushroom's never met Cynthia.
Never been near her house.

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:06.199
Attempted murder and rape.

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:08.279
My God.

01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:09.439
Since when?

01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:13.280
Her first question
after surgery was "Am I pregnant?"

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:19.359
It all came up on footage, this.

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:21.680
Been tracking me dad's movements
since when...

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:23.720
That night.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.359
Not a word from Frank
offered or necessary.

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:35.439
I give you information to avoid
imminent raid or raids

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:38.399
by the drug squad.
We let this one go.

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:39.879
"We"?

01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:41.759
You're not drugs squad.

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:43.759
Unlike your ex.

01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:45.200
Gus Carroll?

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:48.280
How is their new baby?

01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:54.879
Hazel eyes, feeding issues,
astygmatism, two Christenings

01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:56.719
and pyloric stenosis.

01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:58.360
He emails.

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:01.160
Carl, talk to him.

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:05.719
Before we go, from...

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:08.919
it's from thingy.
You get the dates of two planned

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:11.759
drug raids on the table
from South and East divisions.

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:12.560
When?

01:07:12.561 --> 01:07:13.999
Today for all you know.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.959
It's not today. You've still time,
but if it ain't soon,

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:19.040
you'll be leaving your shop behind.

01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:23.399
Plus, you cancel my dad's debts.

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:27.759
Get a job. That's two and half grand
Frank lost me.

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:30.599
Your dead dog tried bumming him
and the shit went all over the shop!

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:31.600
Did she?

01:07:31.601 --> 01:07:33.959
We have got a 14 million to one

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:37.679
DNA match for your brother, forensic
matches of green paint from here

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:40.319
and witness ID from Cynthia
if we need it,

01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:43.320
but she really
doesn't deserve that stress.

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:47.160
He did, Growbag,
he kicked t'fuck out of her.

01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:52.760
We've still got time.

01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:03.560
Where's our Mushroom?

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:06.800
Keep him there.

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:10.079
Plus...

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:12.239
I need town transport.

01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:13.760
Not you driving.

01:08:18.479 --> 01:08:21.399
Mushroom stays with me.

01:08:21.399 --> 01:08:23.679
Nobody fetches him.

01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:24.920
I'll bring him in.

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:28.479
Can I? With a lawyer?

01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:32.200
And you.

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:36.238
You tell Frank...

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:38.198
his slate's clean,

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:42.000
once he's done three 40 hour weeks
on the family stalls.

01:09:10.319 --> 01:09:12.198
I'm here to ask a favour.

01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:15.359
Actually, you owe me big time,
so I'm calling a favour in.

01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:19.679
Micky needs a place to stay,
so I said he can stop here.

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:20.598
That's good of you.

01:09:20.599 --> 01:09:22.000
You need the company.

01:09:22.001 --> 01:09:25.639
Not when you keep coming round
telling me we can't see each other.

01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:27.399
Hiya. Kel said you wouldn't mind.

01:09:27.401 --> 01:09:29.158
You could do with the company.

01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:32.399
No problem, Micky.
Mi shithole es su shithole.

01:09:32.399 --> 01:09:34.078
Told you he wouldn't mind.

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:36.759
Micky could help with the bills.

01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:38.198
Such as they are.

01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:39.438
Such as they are.

01:09:39.439 --> 01:09:41.837
I can grab some stuff from mum's,
make it a bit more comfy and stuff.

01:09:41.839 --> 01:09:43.037
Like a hoover.

01:09:43.038 --> 01:09:44.120
Fumigation kit.

01:09:44.121 --> 01:09:47.719
You'll have
a great time here.

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:48.640
Are you sure you don't mind?

01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:51.880
Like she said. Kelly said.
Do with the company.

01:09:53.359 --> 01:09:54.920
Lonely on my own.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.919
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:01.920
The moment
you've all been waiting for,

01:10:01.921 --> 01:10:04.679
the man you've all been
waiting for.

01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:06.640
The man you owe a fucking fortune

01:10:06.641 --> 01:10:09.359
so dig deep
or you're going to get some looks.

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:12.319
Frank Gallagher!

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:17.239
Wheeey! Fucking hell!

01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:20.959
Go on! Freedom!

01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:22.999
Daniel Day Lewis, fucking what?!

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.519
You knobhead.

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:28.039
The Stillborn Ultimatum.

01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:29.520
Crossing a line, Swampy.

01:10:29.521 --> 01:10:32.119
Come on.
Where were you, Skywalker?

01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:35.439
Third party voyeurism
and bombing about in a car

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:37.080
your Pappy couldn't afford.

01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:42.959
Carl!

01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:45.240
Well done, mate.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.519
You know what you are to me,
my lovely?

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:51.679
Cut it out!

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:53.959
No, come on. A total cunt.

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:55.599
H! Drink on me.

01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:56.720
Butch!

01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:00.839
Drink for the offspring.
Son of the father.

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:03.839
Butch, forget it, this boy's
staying dry as a bone, here.

01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:05.320
I'm running Kev back to Nottingham.

01:11:05.321 --> 01:11:07.559
Are you moving, Jaffa Cake?

01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:13.399
Ladies and gentlemen,
please put your hands together

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:15.319
for Mrs Cynthia Feltz.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.319
Here's the fella!

01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:22.239
Hey, fella! He's my little lover.

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:25.439
My own personal Umpeldink.

01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:28.279
Fuck off,
you stink of Dettol and shit.

01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:29.919
Dettol and shit.

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:32.439
Yeah, so keep your distance,
Fuzzy Feltz.

01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:34.959
No, they had to shave me!

01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:38.319
Everybody's eating!

01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:40.240
Where's your purse, by the way?

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:45.480
Someone want to clue her in
about double jeopardy?

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:54.759
'Fiona was 16
when she took over this family.

01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:58.239
'Debbie was about 11. Well...

01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:00.439
'11 or 12. Lip never did,

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:03.239
'but only cos he was born knowing
about that kind of stuff.

01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:05.959
'I'm 21 and never been asked!'

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:19.000
You know what's really true?

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:22.599
And what's to be admired, Carl?

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:24.760
You've never hurt anybody
in your life, have you?

01:12:24.761 --> 01:12:26.719
Course I fucking have!

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:30.159
You kidding? Welsh Taffy,
when I bust his bollocks.

01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:33.079
Spent a fortnight in hospital.
Ask anybody!

01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:35.719
Yeah, he threatened your Debbie
so you had to hurt back.

01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:38.399
But you've never hurt anybody first,
have you?

01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:40.360
Don't think I wouldn't know how to.

01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:46.478
You should be really proud of that.

01:12:46.479 --> 01:12:47.560
Cut it out, you poof!

01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:55.520
Neither of us
wants to hear me say this.

01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:59.160
You've your dad to thank for that.

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:06.839
Ooof! Oi!

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:09.440
It'll be the airbag next, you prick.

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:14.200
You little shit!

01:13:14.201 --> 01:13:16.399
Sorry, Kev, it's too fucking funny.

01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:25.159
No!

01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:29.680
I'm not concentrating
on the road here!

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:40.959
When people like your mum disappear,
they don't want to be found.

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:43.319
Tell me, you old bitch. Where's Mum?

01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:45.560
Friends that bruise together
stay together.

01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:50.039
She's already out. Sorry, mate.

01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:53.119
If I took him back, I'd be
on the streets shooting up in days.

01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:55.119
Billy is Cilla's dad.

01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:56.719
You shagged a 14-year-old?

01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:58.959
Mum, tell her you're not a paedo.
Are you?

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:02.959
He's back and wants access to Cilla.
Everything's perfect as it is.

01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:05.120
Can you get off me now, please?

01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:09.400
What's the matter? I'm not gay.
