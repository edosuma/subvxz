WEBVTT

00:03.431 --> 00:04.601
When are we gonna spar?

00:04.736 --> 00:06.653
I don't like that look in your eye.

00:06.704 --> 00:09.456
Nah, you're doing great...
just keep dropping your left

00:09.490 --> 00:13.043
every time you throw your
right cross, it'll be fun.

00:21.252 --> 00:22.335
Is Voight dirty?

00:22.386 --> 00:24.137
It's not my department.

00:24.171 --> 00:26.673
So that's a yes.

00:28.259 --> 00:30.343
I almost went down the
tubes when I was in Vice,

00:30.378 --> 00:32.962
which was right around the time
I stopped judging other cops.

00:32.996 --> 00:34.597
I'm not looking for judgment,

00:34.632 --> 00:38.134
just a definition.

00:38.168 --> 00:41.438
Do I learn from him, or
do I keep my distance?

00:41.472 --> 00:43.390
Both.

00:43.441 --> 00:47.176
But if you really wanna know
if he's dirty or not, ask her.

00:47.194 --> 00:48.361
Jazzercise is, like, a block south.

00:48.396 --> 00:50.897
Yeah, nice muscle tee.

00:50.948 --> 00:53.033
This is perfectly acceptable
attire for the boxing gym.

00:53.067 --> 00:54.818
No, absolutely,

00:54.852 --> 00:56.403
and the bonus is you
don't have to change later

00:56.454 --> 00:58.688
when you break-dance.

01:00.124 --> 01:02.692
- Voight's kid.
- Justin.

01:02.710 --> 01:05.211
This is Antonio and Jay. I work with them.

01:05.245 --> 01:09.031
Antonio's buddy owns the
gym, hence the 30% discount.

01:09.050 --> 01:11.534
- 20%. Nice try.
- All right.

01:12.536 --> 01:15.588
How you doing?

01:18.676 --> 01:20.727
I gotta make some calls.

01:22.596 --> 01:24.347
He's like my little brother.

01:24.381 --> 01:25.899
I'm just trying to keep him out of trouble.

01:25.933 --> 01:27.067
Good luck.

01:27.101 --> 01:30.070
Just give him a shot.

01:37.328 --> 01:39.496
Popped these guys selling off the corner.

01:39.530 --> 01:41.498
Big guy, Maurice Owens,

01:41.532 --> 01:42.406
said to call you.

01:43.386 --> 01:44.353
Man, they planted that dope on me.

01:44.387 --> 01:46.855
Shut up.

01:49.248 --> 01:51.483
I'm gonna need my boys to
take a slide on this too.

01:51.501 --> 01:53.785
I don't know these guys
from a load of wood.

01:53.819 --> 01:55.253
They're on their own.

01:55.288 --> 01:57.489
- You can cut Maurice loose.
- Based on?

01:57.507 --> 01:59.458
Based on me saying you can cut him loose.

01:59.492 --> 02:00.625
What am I gonna tell...

02:00.659 --> 02:02.210
I don't care what you tell 'em.

02:02.261 --> 02:03.211
Uncuff him.

02:03.262 --> 02:06.965
Write him out of your report.

02:10.019 --> 02:11.937
I'ma bail y'all out. Don't worry.

02:11.971 --> 02:14.890
- Yeah.
- Come on, do it.

02:16.442 --> 02:17.809
I told you my boy would take care...

02:17.843 --> 02:19.144
Damn.

02:26.869 --> 02:29.854
- My bad.
- Tell him.

02:33.743 --> 02:35.693
My bad.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:44.253 --> 02:45.587
2 grand.

02:45.638 --> 02:48.006
Man, I didn't come across
town for no 2 grand.

02:48.040 --> 02:49.257
Well, it was gonna be 5

02:49.308 --> 02:52.377
till you chumped me in front of my crew.

02:52.395 --> 02:55.897
I don't pay you to get disrespected.

02:55.932 --> 02:58.600
Know that.

02:58.651 --> 03:02.487
You wanna go toe-to-toe with me, Maurice?

03:04.073 --> 03:07.159
I'll have 5 grand in my mitt

03:07.193 --> 03:09.444
by the end of the night,

03:09.495 --> 03:13.915
or the ground is gonna open underneath you.

03:29.015 --> 03:32.917
All I'm saying is Justin
looks like an uphill battle.

03:32.935 --> 03:36.104
That kid lost his mother and
then did a year in prison.

03:36.139 --> 03:37.689
He just needs to get his bearings.

03:37.723 --> 03:39.808
Did you see the attitude
he gave me in the gym?

03:39.859 --> 03:41.109
If I had just gotten out of Statesville

03:41.144 --> 03:43.145
and had been made to shake
hands with a bunch of cops,

03:43.196 --> 03:44.729
I would've had the exact same attitude.

03:44.763 --> 03:46.782
I don't think it's so much I'm a cop

03:46.816 --> 03:48.400
as much as Justin thinks
I'm your boyfriend.

03:48.434 --> 03:50.435
- You wish.
- You wish.

03:50.453 --> 03:53.455
No, you wish.

04:02.448 --> 04:04.115
- Hey.
- Bye.

04:04.133 --> 04:07.118
I'll see you after work, okay?

04:07.136 --> 04:10.121
Oh. Hey, Adam.

04:10.139 --> 04:11.723
- Yeah?
- Lunch.

04:11.757 --> 04:13.008
Right. How could I possibly forget?

04:13.059 --> 04:15.427
Don't forget about dinner tonight.

04:15.461 --> 04:16.812
Baby, my parents haven't
been in the same room

04:16.846 --> 04:18.230
since my high school graduation.

04:18.264 --> 04:19.731
I really think that they
should draw straws...

04:19.765 --> 04:22.317
They should both be at the wedding.

04:23.969 --> 04:26.137
Promise me you'll be there.

04:26.155 --> 04:29.107
Are you Wendy?

04:29.141 --> 04:30.659
- Hi.
- Hey.

04:30.693 --> 04:32.143
Alvin.

04:32.161 --> 04:35.163
Um...

04:35.165 --> 04:36.832
Adam's partner.

04:36.866 --> 04:39.817
Adam didn't tell me he had a partner.

04:39.836 --> 04:42.170
Good, good.

04:42.205 --> 04:45.340
He's following protocol.

04:45.374 --> 04:46.341
Okay.

04:46.375 --> 04:50.212
I will see you after work.

04:50.263 --> 04:51.847
All right.

04:51.881 --> 04:53.265
Al, I'm telling you, she's killing me

04:53.299 --> 04:54.799
with this wedding planning,
and she does not understand

04:54.833 --> 04:56.101
that making my parents eat together,

04:56.135 --> 04:59.387
it's the Ruzek nuclear option.

04:59.438 --> 05:01.523
Just China patterns and registries.

05:01.557 --> 05:02.974
This is gonna be a nightmare.

05:03.008 --> 05:06.010
Hey, are you through?

05:06.028 --> 05:08.697
Because when you're here, you're here.

05:08.731 --> 05:12.450
So don't pass through
that gate until you are.

05:12.485 --> 05:13.518
Okay.

05:20.326 --> 05:22.494
The district's been
awarded a new patrol car.

05:22.528 --> 05:24.296
And since you guys went above and beyond

05:24.330 --> 05:27.215
on that hoarder deal,
I'm assigning it to you.

05:27.250 --> 05:28.416
It's got 20 miles.

05:28.467 --> 05:30.001
You can still get high
off the factory fumes.

05:30.035 --> 05:31.836
I heard those new ones got,
like, 400 horsepower in 'em.

05:31.870 --> 05:33.054
You listen up.

05:33.089 --> 05:35.707
Commander Perry is going
to drive it as a show car

05:35.725 --> 05:37.542
in next week's toys for tots parade.

05:37.560 --> 05:39.594
You bring it back with
so much as a scratch,

05:39.645 --> 05:41.096
you're gonna have to answer
to him... you hear me?

05:41.147 --> 05:42.714
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes.

05:42.797 --> 05:43.797
Thank you.

05:43.831 --> 05:45.582
Yeah.

05:45.616 --> 05:48.718
I mean, this thing is
nicer than my apartment.

05:48.753 --> 05:50.971
Oh, watch this, here it is.

05:53.224 --> 05:54.307
Yeah.

05:54.342 --> 05:55.976
That's 400 horses, girl.

05:56.010 --> 05:57.844
I ain't playin'.

05:57.895 --> 06:00.347
Do you see that?

06:00.398 --> 06:01.514
Hit the lights.

06:02.900 --> 06:06.353
This girl needs help, please.

06:08.239 --> 06:10.139
Miss, are you okay?

06:14.078 --> 06:16.746
This is beat 2113... we got
a disturbance with a mental.

06:16.781 --> 06:19.666
Ladies, I need you to...

06:19.700 --> 06:21.251
Burgess.

06:25.840 --> 06:27.824
Damn.

06:27.842 --> 06:29.259
What the hell was that?

06:32.329 --> 06:33.713
What do we got?

06:33.764 --> 06:36.049
Female, white, just got out of surgery.

06:36.100 --> 06:38.334
I heard female white knocked
you around pretty good.

06:38.352 --> 06:40.020
Whatever she was on gave
her the strength of ten men.

06:40.054 --> 06:41.554
- Hmm.
- No I.D.

06:41.605 --> 06:43.640
All she had on her was this plane ticket.

06:43.674 --> 06:46.175
She landed at O'Hare this
morning from Cabo San Lucas.

06:46.193 --> 06:47.894
Just how much cocaine does she have on her?

06:47.945 --> 06:51.347
Not on her. Inside her.

06:51.365 --> 06:54.851
30 balloons in her stomach.

06:55.485 --> 06:59.381
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

07:00.615 --> 07:02.920
Normally, when cops drag screamers in here,

07:02.925 --> 07:05.119
we just give 'em a haldol
cocktail and send them into detox,

07:05.373 --> 07:06.573
but she started convulsing,

07:06.591 --> 07:08.241
and I knew right away this was different.

07:08.260 --> 07:09.242
Welcome to Chicago,

07:09.261 --> 07:10.761
distribution center of the midwest.

07:10.795 --> 07:14.181
We removed 29 condoms full of cocaine,

07:14.215 --> 07:15.582
though she swallowed 30.

07:15.600 --> 07:18.218
One broke open and started
to dissolve into her stomach.

07:18.252 --> 07:20.554
The drug leaked into her bloodstream,

07:20.588 --> 07:24.808
causing her psychosis, so
I ordered emergency surgery.

07:24.859 --> 07:28.095
Never ceases to amaze me
what people will do for money.

07:28.113 --> 07:31.932
Well, sometimes, people don't
feel like they have a choice.

07:31.950 --> 07:34.368
I tested the residue on the broken balloon.

07:34.402 --> 07:36.937
It's 89% pure.

07:36.955 --> 07:38.939
That's the highest grade I've ever seen.

07:38.957 --> 07:41.158
All these must be 50k street value.

07:41.209 --> 07:43.443
- Easy.
- So what do we think?

07:43.461 --> 07:45.829
Cartel's getting smart
recruiting all-American types?

07:45.880 --> 07:47.447
They're full of air pockets.

07:47.465 --> 07:49.917
That's why they busted. It's amateur hour.

07:49.951 --> 07:51.418
Cartel wouldn't be this careless.

07:51.452 --> 07:54.004
We need to question her. How
soon till she's conscious?

07:54.055 --> 07:55.839
Two, maybe three hours.

07:55.890 --> 07:58.458
All right, have Jin
contact the TSA at O'Hare.

07:58.476 --> 08:01.478
See if we can get an I.D. on this girl.

08:04.816 --> 08:06.299
We're so screwed.

08:06.318 --> 08:08.185
Yep.

08:08.236 --> 08:09.520
Platt's gonna freak.

08:09.571 --> 08:11.438
We have to take it to the police garage.

08:11.472 --> 08:14.191
No, the police garage
takes a month to fix a flat.

08:14.242 --> 08:17.978
The toys for tots parade is this weekend.

08:17.996 --> 08:21.415
I got a better idea.

08:21.449 --> 08:23.534
All right.

08:23.585 --> 08:25.169
What's up?

08:25.203 --> 08:27.287
I see y'all got a lot of paint damage, man.

08:27.321 --> 08:29.006
Got a hell of a dent right here.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.507
This busted side mirror.

08:30.542 --> 08:32.659
You're gonna give me two
days on this, Atwater.

08:32.677 --> 08:34.461
Eh, I'm thinking a lot sooner,

08:34.495 --> 08:36.046
like by the end of this shift.

08:36.097 --> 08:37.597
Bro, you came here for
the same-day service?

08:37.631 --> 08:38.849
You know that's gonna cost you, right?

08:38.883 --> 08:41.385
I got $300 of Foot
Locker gift cards for you.

08:41.436 --> 08:42.836
I can get another 100 by tomorrow.

08:42.854 --> 08:44.438
Come on, man. Nah.

08:44.472 --> 08:46.190
It's not a swap meet, okay?

08:46.224 --> 08:48.025
You ask me to fix a cop car, bro.

08:48.059 --> 08:51.779
$500 cash, or no deal.

08:51.813 --> 08:53.564
- Make it happen, man.
- All right, man.

08:53.615 --> 08:55.849
- All right.
- Yeah, you know I got you.

08:55.867 --> 08:57.317
All right, boys, we got another one.

08:57.351 --> 08:58.902
- How much you got?
- What?

08:58.953 --> 09:01.071
I don't know, like... like, $18.

09:01.122 --> 09:03.857
We need to hit an ATM 'cause
Carl don't take checks.

09:03.875 --> 09:05.542
I don't have 250 bucks,

09:05.577 --> 09:08.545
not until we get paid Friday.

09:08.580 --> 09:11.465
Get on the horn and borrow it then.

09:12.594 --> 09:14.712
According to the flight manifest,

09:14.763 --> 09:17.715
your girl's name is Amber Morris.

09:17.766 --> 09:20.551
Came in on the red-eye from
Cabo San Lucas this morning.

09:20.602 --> 09:22.720
Was she traveling with anyone?

09:22.771 --> 09:24.054
Great question.

09:24.105 --> 09:26.857
- Can I finish?
- Sorry.

09:26.891 --> 09:28.192
Four tickets total were purchased

09:28.226 --> 09:31.678
on Amber's credit card.

09:31.696 --> 09:33.981
And here they are,

09:34.015 --> 09:36.200
her and her friends getting off the plane.

09:37.351 --> 09:41.455
You think all those girls are mules?

09:41.489 --> 09:44.124
All right, so our girl in
the E.R. is Amber Morris.

09:44.159 --> 09:46.126
Amber and her three friends
here are all undergrads

09:46.161 --> 09:47.244
at Central Chicago University.

09:47.295 --> 09:48.361
This is who we're looking for.

09:48.380 --> 09:49.997
We checked Amber's Facebook page.

09:50.031 --> 09:51.749
There's pictures of them
living it up in Cabo,

09:51.800 --> 09:53.867
but not just from this trip.

09:53.885 --> 09:56.036
Amber's been down there twice
in the last three months.

09:56.071 --> 09:57.337
First time, she did the run herself.

09:57.371 --> 09:58.722
This time, she recruited friends.

09:58.757 --> 10:00.891
We gotta assume all these girls are mules

10:00.925 --> 10:03.844
and ingested the same type
of balloons packed with coke.

10:03.878 --> 10:05.763
You guys, I ran down
those girls' addresses.

10:05.814 --> 10:07.147
All three live on campus.

10:07.182 --> 10:08.766
We gotta move.

10:11.052 --> 10:12.385
Let's go.

10:12.404 --> 10:16.223
You like working in this unit,
you keep it in your pants.

10:16.241 --> 10:18.826
I didn't know it was out.

10:18.860 --> 10:20.110
Erin's off-limits.

10:20.161 --> 10:22.162
End of discussion.

10:40.432 --> 10:42.633
Hey. Sergeant.

10:55.947 --> 10:58.115
Sarah Hines. Chicago PD.

11:07.942 --> 11:10.961
Well, she made it home.

11:10.995 --> 11:13.113
Megan.

11:13.131 --> 11:14.965
Megan Benson.

11:29.764 --> 11:30.981
Alicia Davis?

11:31.015 --> 11:33.517
Help.

11:37.805 --> 11:40.440
- Who are you?
- I'm Shelly Bates.

11:40.474 --> 11:42.475
- I'm an R.A.
- Alicia do this to you?

11:42.494 --> 11:43.476
No, two guys.

11:43.495 --> 11:45.445
They took her.

11:45.479 --> 11:50.000
She was really sick. I tried to help.

11:50.034 --> 11:51.919
We're looking for two white males.

11:51.953 --> 11:54.487
Could still be in the
area. They got our girls.

12:16.044 --> 12:18.040
All right, Hank, just
keep us posted on the van.

12:20.520 --> 12:23.512
So messed up... these girls
out there with no idea.

12:24.182 --> 12:25.883
Yeah.

12:27.051 --> 12:28.585
I'm gonna need a drink when this is done.

12:28.619 --> 12:31.255
What do you say?

12:31.289 --> 12:34.725
Oh, I don't think your dad would like that.

12:34.759 --> 12:36.310
What are you talking about?

12:36.344 --> 12:40.481
What do you think I'm talking about?

12:41.983 --> 12:45.235
She's awake now. You can come and see her.

12:48.990 --> 12:52.242
I can't believe I'm in here.

12:52.277 --> 12:53.477
Believe it, Amber,

12:53.495 --> 12:54.995
and whoever you were smuggling for

12:55.029 --> 12:57.647
just kidnapped your friends.

12:57.665 --> 12:59.316
So if you don't give up who's behind this

12:59.334 --> 13:01.118
and we find your friends dead,

13:01.152 --> 13:03.287
you're gonna be facing
narcotics-induced homicide

13:03.321 --> 13:04.421
all by your lonesome.

13:04.456 --> 13:08.325
- I can't.
- Are you listening?

13:08.343 --> 13:10.043
You're lucky we found you.

13:10.094 --> 13:12.079
Now, all you're gonna have
is a scar on your stomach,

13:12.113 --> 13:14.014
but your friends, they'll likely O.D.

13:14.048 --> 13:15.098
and wind up in some alley.

13:15.133 --> 13:16.717
And if that happens, I promise you

13:16.751 --> 13:19.553
you will never forgive yourself.

13:19.604 --> 13:23.524
You need to help us save them, Amber.

13:23.558 --> 13:27.344
I loved him.

13:27.362 --> 13:31.031
Sweetheart, the guy
that used you for this...

13:31.065 --> 13:32.866
he doesn't love you.

13:40.959 --> 13:44.828
I did it once, and it was fine.

13:44.862 --> 13:49.533
Then he promised my
friends 5 grand each to go.

13:49.551 --> 13:52.085
It was my boyfriend's idea,

13:52.136 --> 13:55.088
him and his brother.

13:59.644 --> 14:00.894
We're putting out an investigative alert

14:00.929 --> 14:02.396
on a Sean and Brendan Collins.

14:02.430 --> 14:03.730
They're the dealers we're looking for.

14:03.765 --> 14:05.566
Sean's the boyfriend. Amber
says him and his brother,

14:05.600 --> 14:07.551
they hang out at a tattoo
shop called "Underground Ink."

14:07.569 --> 14:08.936
That's where they sling the product.

14:08.987 --> 14:10.904
- Good work.
- I'll get Olinsky and Ruzek

14:10.939 --> 14:14.107
to set up on this tattoo shop.

14:15.577 --> 14:17.578
No, those are loaded
with carbs and sugar, man.

14:17.612 --> 14:20.697
- But they're good carbs.
- No, no, stakeout 101.

14:20.731 --> 14:22.783
You gotta go all-natural, all-protein.

14:22.834 --> 14:24.835
Too much carbs leave
you tired and unfocused.

14:24.869 --> 14:26.670
You don't wanna be in a carbohydrate coma.

14:26.704 --> 14:30.207
That's what these are for, Al.

14:30.241 --> 14:31.875
Hey, uh...

14:31.909 --> 14:34.578
So patrol already confirmed
that the Collins brothers

14:34.596 --> 14:36.213
aren't at this tattoo parlor.

14:36.247 --> 14:37.464
Why do we got to babysit it?

14:37.515 --> 14:40.133
That's what they pay us for.

14:40.184 --> 14:41.935
- Yeah.
- You're what?

14:41.970 --> 14:45.022
You're 32?

14:45.056 --> 14:46.607
Wait, wait, wait. What are those for?

14:46.641 --> 14:49.860
You're on a stakeout for who knows how long

14:49.894 --> 14:51.428
drinking that fluorescent poison...

14:51.446 --> 14:53.530
you're not gonna be able to hold it.

14:53.565 --> 14:54.598
You can't be serious.

14:54.616 --> 14:56.933
I'll find somewhere to take a leak.

14:56.951 --> 14:58.318
You know, when I was a
rookie, I was assigned

14:58.369 --> 14:59.820
to keep eyes on this B&E crew

14:59.871 --> 15:01.038
that nobody could touch. Right.

15:01.072 --> 15:03.123
The first time I got
eyes on him, I lost him.

15:03.157 --> 15:04.992
- You know why?
- No.

15:05.043 --> 15:07.294
'Cause I had to take a piss.

15:07.328 --> 15:08.912
And I'm gone three, four minutes tops.

15:08.946 --> 15:10.714
And I say to myself, "next
time I got eyes on him,

15:10.748 --> 15:12.466
I'm not gonna move.
I'm not going anywhere."

15:12.500 --> 15:14.001
And that's where these came in.

15:14.052 --> 15:16.670
And I nailed the crew pulling
a million-dollar score.

15:16.721 --> 15:18.288
All right?

15:25.680 --> 15:27.297
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:27.315 --> 15:29.266
The girl who's in the hospital,

15:29.300 --> 15:31.568
Amber Morris, her mother's downstairs.

15:31.603 --> 15:34.438
All right, bring her up.

15:34.472 --> 15:36.306
I'm assuming that's Spanish

15:36.324 --> 15:39.826
for "you're gonna go down
there and get her yourself."

15:42.614 --> 15:45.332
I'm telling you my daughter
had nothing to do with this.

15:45.366 --> 15:47.150
Ma'am...

15:47.168 --> 15:49.152
they cut 30 condoms packed with cocaine

15:49.170 --> 15:50.487
out of your daughter's stomach.

15:50.505 --> 15:52.489
I'm pretty sure she had
something to do with it.

15:52.507 --> 15:53.924
Someone must have forced her.

15:53.958 --> 15:55.825
You need to go after
them and not my daughter.

15:55.843 --> 15:56.960
The way it looks so far

15:56.994 --> 15:59.212
is Amber did this of her own free will.

15:59.263 --> 16:01.632
That couldn't be.

16:01.666 --> 16:04.384
Amber was a good student.
She just made the Dean's list.

16:04.435 --> 16:08.689
She did this for money, Mrs. Morris.

16:08.723 --> 16:11.341
I know this is hard for you to hear.

16:11.359 --> 16:13.610
Hard to believe.

16:13.645 --> 16:15.195
But kids go off to college.

16:15.229 --> 16:17.481
They get away from their parents.

16:17.515 --> 16:20.350
Sometimes they get mixed up in bad things.

16:24.355 --> 16:26.873
What's gonna happen to her?

16:26.908 --> 16:29.242
She's been cooperative so far.

16:29.293 --> 16:30.243
We'll talk to the state's attorney,

16:30.294 --> 16:34.464
try to keep her out of jail.

16:43.591 --> 16:45.425
I have a daughter.

16:45.476 --> 16:48.845
She's 13.

16:48.879 --> 16:51.732
I worry about her with her friends,

16:51.766 --> 16:53.483
with boys.

16:56.938 --> 16:59.489
But you can't watch 'em every second.

17:02.110 --> 17:04.744
At least Amber's alive.

17:16.290 --> 17:18.458
You know, there is no way
these guys show up here

17:18.509 --> 17:21.094
with three kidnapped girls.

17:21.128 --> 17:24.247
Criminals get desperate, cops get overtime.

17:24.265 --> 17:25.298
You in a hurry to punch out?

17:25.348 --> 17:29.770
Well, I got this dinner tonight.

17:29.804 --> 17:31.805
My mom and my stepmom,
they hate each other,

17:31.856 --> 17:35.559
so it's on me to make
sure they both show up

17:35.593 --> 17:37.761
to the wedding and don't kill one another.

17:37.779 --> 17:40.147
Ask me if I'm excited.

17:50.658 --> 17:53.210
Hey, Al, no, that's Wendy.
Come on, don't clear it.

17:53.244 --> 17:55.128
Don't clear it.

17:55.163 --> 17:58.298
All right.

17:58.332 --> 18:00.116
All right.

18:00.134 --> 18:03.804
Right there.

18:03.838 --> 18:05.472
Focus on the task at hand.

18:05.506 --> 18:07.040
All right.

18:07.075 --> 18:09.793
The Collins brothers are
known thugs from Bridgeport.

18:09.811 --> 18:11.061
Both have records for armed robbery

18:11.095 --> 18:12.896
and aggravated battery.

18:12.930 --> 18:14.431
So they've graduated to drug smuggling

18:14.465 --> 18:15.816
using naive college girls.

18:15.850 --> 18:18.468
Had uniforms check their IKAs.
These guys are in the wind.

18:18.486 --> 18:20.020
DMV came back that Brendan Collins

18:20.071 --> 18:21.521
owns a black Ford van.

18:21.572 --> 18:22.522
I'm assuming that these brothers

18:22.573 --> 18:24.140
are using throwaway phones

18:24.158 --> 18:26.326
now that they know Amber's been arrested.

18:26.360 --> 18:27.494
All right, keep digging.

18:27.528 --> 18:29.529
Get me any known associates.

18:29.580 --> 18:31.698
Hey, we need to talk.

18:31.749 --> 18:33.366
Come on.

18:39.590 --> 18:41.925
Yeah?

18:41.959 --> 18:42.959
The overprotective father thing

18:42.993 --> 18:44.294
was fine when I was a teenager,

18:44.328 --> 18:46.546
but I don't need you
looking out for me anymore.

18:46.581 --> 18:48.965
It's Halstead I'm looking out for.

18:48.999 --> 18:51.017
I've seen what happens
to the guys you date.

18:51.052 --> 18:52.502
What is that supposed to mean?

18:52.520 --> 18:53.770
You've left a string of broken hearts

18:53.805 --> 18:56.006
behind you since you were 15.

18:56.040 --> 18:58.859
I need Halstead 100%
effective, not throwing pebbles

18:58.893 --> 19:00.176
at your window at 3:00 in the morning.

19:00.194 --> 19:01.978
You don't get to tell me who I can

19:02.012 --> 19:03.947
and can't hang out with
on my personal time.

19:03.981 --> 19:07.234
My unit, my rules. You wanna date a cop?

19:07.285 --> 19:10.954
There are plenty other districts out there.

19:20.531 --> 19:22.699
Hey, just got a ping
on Brendan Collins' van.

19:22.717 --> 19:24.835
- Where?
- Everything all right?

19:24.869 --> 19:26.970
Just send me the address.

19:37.315 --> 19:40.350
All right, Jin, work your magic.

19:40.384 --> 19:42.936
Stand by. Let me get comfy.

19:42.987 --> 19:44.771
We got eyes on the van yet?

19:44.822 --> 19:46.690
Said I'm getting comfy.

19:46.724 --> 19:48.275
Okay, got eyes on 'em.

19:48.326 --> 19:50.944
Comin' up 76th towards Western.

19:50.978 --> 19:52.913
Turning into an alley.

19:52.947 --> 19:54.447
Heading south towards 77th.

19:54.498 --> 19:55.899
We're on it.

20:03.424 --> 20:05.792
Got a visual on Brendan Collins.

20:09.547 --> 20:11.548
Van's on the move, headed north on 76th.

20:11.582 --> 20:12.966
Jin, you got it, or what?

20:13.017 --> 20:15.719
Got him. He's goin' west on 75th.

20:31.903 --> 20:34.537
- There's the van.
- All right, let's box it in.

20:50.214 --> 20:51.735
- Sir, are you ok?
- I'm fine.

20:53.217 --> 20:57.285
5020 Lincoln. Emergency. Roll
an ambulance to 7320 Western.

20:57.298 --> 20:58.712
Copy that. Ambo on the way.

21:00.705 --> 21:02.322
He's toast.

21:02.373 --> 21:04.958
The girls!

21:21.125 --> 21:23.426
He had a 9 mil and a throwaway phone.

21:23.460 --> 21:25.261
No trace of the coke or the girls.

21:25.295 --> 21:26.513
So every second that goes by,

21:26.564 --> 21:28.131
the less chance those girls survive.

21:28.149 --> 21:30.400
We're all aware of that, Erin.

21:30.434 --> 21:31.968
Everybody stay cool.

21:31.986 --> 21:34.487
Get that phone over to Jin asap.

21:34.522 --> 21:36.156
Have him run the calls on it.

21:36.190 --> 21:37.907
You're comin' with me.

21:37.942 --> 21:39.192
Where are you going?

21:39.243 --> 21:41.578
Higher up the family tree.

21:46.500 --> 21:48.535
How do you lay here this long?

21:48.586 --> 21:50.653
I'm bored out of my mind.

21:50.671 --> 21:53.156
You train your mind, your body will follow.

21:53.174 --> 21:55.842
Yeah, well,

21:55.876 --> 21:58.327
I'm gonna go stretch my legs, all right?

22:12.193 --> 22:14.277
Hey, baby.

22:14.311 --> 22:15.612
- What'd I say?
- Al, come on.

22:15.646 --> 22:17.063
I need to talk to her quick.

22:17.114 --> 22:18.181
Al.

22:18.199 --> 22:20.283
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Rookie mistake.

22:20.317 --> 22:21.701
I don't wanna have to say it again.

22:21.736 --> 22:23.737
- You stay focused now.
- What the hell's your problem?

22:23.788 --> 22:26.823
Just get your ass to the edge of that roof.

22:29.076 --> 22:31.077
You're buyin' me a new phone.

22:31.128 --> 22:35.198
Yeah, on the corner of...
of Laramie and Jackson.

22:35.216 --> 22:38.201
Yeah, it's the far west side.

22:38.219 --> 22:39.753
Yes, I know it's the ghetto,

22:39.804 --> 22:43.673
but you're not gonna get robbed, Caitlan.

22:43.707 --> 22:45.875
Are you kidding me? I'm a cop.

22:45.893 --> 22:47.877
Beat 2113.

22:47.895 --> 22:50.880
- Go... go for 2113.
- We have a store owner

22:50.898 --> 22:54.567
holding a female shoplifter
at 3300 West Kinzie.

22:54.602 --> 22:55.985
That's ten blocks away.

22:56.020 --> 22:58.405
Store owner says the
woman is making threats

22:58.439 --> 23:00.190
and could be armed.

23:00.224 --> 23:02.325
10-4. We're en route.

23:15.256 --> 23:16.423
I want her arrested.

23:16.457 --> 23:17.874
All right, how about I take that bat, sir?

23:17.908 --> 23:20.343
- You said she was armed?
- I don't know. Look at her.

23:20.377 --> 23:22.578
She's a crackhead. Figured
she might have a weapon.

23:22.596 --> 23:24.380
What did she try to steal?

23:24.414 --> 23:26.582
I caught her trying to
put this under her coat.

23:31.303 --> 23:33.855
Ma'am.

23:33.889 --> 23:35.857
Did you try and steal the bread?

23:35.891 --> 23:37.642
My husband sold our link card,

23:37.676 --> 23:39.227
and I don't have any money.

23:39.278 --> 23:40.645
I'm not a drug addict.

23:40.679 --> 23:42.947
I just wanted to make my boy a sandwich.

23:42.982 --> 23:45.316
You gonna arrest her or what?

23:45.350 --> 23:47.518
How much is the bread?

23:47.536 --> 23:49.120
$1.50.

23:51.957 --> 23:53.658
How about we let it slide?

23:53.692 --> 23:56.327
Have her work it off helping you...

23:56.361 --> 23:57.629
clean up or something?

23:57.663 --> 23:59.748
This junkie tried to rip me off.

23:59.799 --> 24:01.499
Do your job and lock her up,

24:01.533 --> 24:03.835
or I'm gonna call some real police.

24:05.221 --> 24:06.554
You want the real police?

24:06.589 --> 24:08.840
- He wants the real police.
- He wants the real police.

24:08.874 --> 24:11.476
Okay, okay. Well, now you've got 'em.

24:11.510 --> 24:13.711
Let's follow this by the
letter of the law, shall we?

24:13.729 --> 24:15.764
- Let's do it.
- Atwater.

24:15.815 --> 24:17.715
Do all those licenses look up to date?

24:17.733 --> 24:19.150
Cigarettes, dairy, produce?

24:19.185 --> 24:20.852
Uh, step aside for a second, sir.

24:20.886 --> 24:22.053
Let me take this out.

24:22.071 --> 24:24.522
Hey, I pay my taxes that pays your salary.

24:24.556 --> 24:25.990
She's the one who broke the law.

24:26.025 --> 24:27.442
Are those rat turds?

24:27.493 --> 24:29.027
Mm. It look like rat turds.

24:29.061 --> 24:30.361
They do look like rat turds.

24:30.395 --> 24:32.414
That's a definite violation.

24:32.448 --> 24:33.581
And look at that.

24:33.616 --> 24:36.868
Faulty wires. That's against code.

24:36.902 --> 24:41.923
See, I see about $20,000 in fines so far.

24:41.957 --> 24:43.407
Just get her outta here.

24:43.426 --> 24:46.544
Come on, ma'am. You're all right.

24:50.749 --> 24:52.917
Here you go.

24:52.935 --> 24:55.053
There's an old saying, Mr. Taxpayer.

24:55.087 --> 24:57.272
You can't talk your way out of a ticket,

24:57.306 --> 24:59.390
but you sure as hell can
talk your way into one.

25:06.315 --> 25:07.532
Hey.

25:07.566 --> 25:09.150
Yo.

25:09.201 --> 25:11.402
Is deputy dog pissed you're
sneaking out to meet me?

25:11.436 --> 25:12.787
- Who, Halstead?
- Figured you had

25:12.822 --> 25:14.372
a little thing with him or something.

25:14.406 --> 25:16.440
Yeah. It's called "work."

25:16.459 --> 25:18.710
Whatever. Did you get it?

25:21.297 --> 25:24.165
Why aren't you at the CTA training class?

25:24.216 --> 25:26.384
Because I left my wallet in your car,

25:26.418 --> 25:28.253
and I don't have my I.D.

25:28.287 --> 25:30.638
I rescheduled it for next week.

25:30.673 --> 25:33.091
Justin.

25:33.125 --> 25:34.759
Your dad pulled a lot of strings

25:34.793 --> 25:37.345
to get you this job, all right?

25:37.396 --> 25:39.814
The least you could do is show up.

25:39.849 --> 25:42.684
Punch in a little while, make him happy?

25:42.735 --> 25:44.903
Come on, Erin. CTA is not a career.

25:44.937 --> 25:46.521
I got other things cookin', anyways.

25:46.572 --> 25:47.822
Oh, really?

25:49.775 --> 25:51.826
Is that your ride?

25:52.978 --> 25:54.579
Don't worry about it. He's cool.

25:54.613 --> 25:55.697
Just an old friend.

25:55.748 --> 25:56.865
All right.

25:56.916 --> 25:58.082
I'll text you later.

25:58.117 --> 25:59.483
Maybe we'll hang out after work,

25:59.502 --> 26:01.169
get some drinks or somethin'.

26:01.203 --> 26:02.754
Or maybe I'll give you a ride home.

26:02.788 --> 26:04.655
You know you have curfew.

26:30.950 --> 26:33.401
Just watch my back.

26:33.452 --> 26:35.820
Gavin Collins.

26:35.854 --> 26:38.239
Hank.

26:38.290 --> 26:40.708
We're in the middle of a game.

26:40.743 --> 26:43.211
Well, congratulations.

26:43.245 --> 26:46.464
You won.

26:48.700 --> 26:50.668
This morning, I had two nephews.

26:50.702 --> 26:53.421
You wanna explain that?

26:53.472 --> 26:55.723
Your nephews use girls to swallow cocaine

26:55.758 --> 26:57.392
and bring it up from Mexico.

26:57.426 --> 27:01.179
Brendan took us on a high-speed chase.

27:01.213 --> 27:04.098
He dug his own grave.

27:04.149 --> 27:06.401
Sorry. I ain't got time to talk.

27:06.435 --> 27:08.987
After this, I gotta go
see my sister grieve.

27:09.021 --> 27:11.222
So take your college junkie whores

27:11.240 --> 27:13.724
and shove 'em up your ass.

27:18.080 --> 27:19.397
Gimme that!

27:21.917 --> 27:23.835
Keep him down.

27:33.078 --> 27:35.129
Your nephew Sean is out there right now

27:35.180 --> 27:37.298
with three kidnapped girls.

27:37.349 --> 27:39.467
Odds are they don't
make it through the night

27:39.518 --> 27:43.254
if I don't find them.

27:43.272 --> 27:45.773
He's got a stash out somewhere.

27:45.808 --> 27:48.526
You got three seconds
to give me the address,

27:48.560 --> 27:51.429
or I'm gonna blow your
brains all over the floor.

27:51.447 --> 27:52.947
One.

27:52.982 --> 27:55.283
Two.

28:01.106 --> 28:05.159
Half the swag from midway must be in here.

28:05.210 --> 28:07.996
Check the back.

28:32.438 --> 28:35.156
Megan Benson.

28:42.634 --> 28:45.960
Girl was 19. Still in school. What a waste.

28:45.967 --> 28:46.581
Why do only one?

28:46.615 --> 28:48.583
Where's the other two?
We're not dealing with a pro.

28:48.617 --> 28:51.119
Collins got squeamish and ran.

28:51.170 --> 28:54.088
Whoever cut into her cut
into the condom balloons,

28:54.123 --> 28:55.456
destroyed most the cocaine.

28:55.507 --> 28:57.258
Thanks, doc.

28:58.344 --> 28:59.410
There's no way Collins can afford

28:59.428 --> 29:00.845
to do that to the other two.

29:00.880 --> 29:03.264
Look, I got some business to take care of.

29:03.299 --> 29:05.917
See if Jin's got anything yet, all right?

29:08.086 --> 29:09.771
I was able to obtain subscriber info

29:09.805 --> 29:11.556
for all calls from Brendan's cell phone

29:11.590 --> 29:13.424
that you found in his van.

29:13.442 --> 29:16.361
Only two numbers, first
to Sean's prepaid cell

29:16.395 --> 29:17.896
which has since gone dead, but I was able

29:17.930 --> 29:20.264
to track it to a dumpster on Ashland.

29:20.282 --> 29:22.934
Second, six calls to this guy.

29:22.952 --> 29:24.435
- Ryan Porter.
- Ryan Porter.

29:24.453 --> 29:27.155
Male, white, 26. Long sheet for possession.

29:27.206 --> 29:28.539
Worked as a paramedic for three different

29:28.574 --> 29:30.491
ambulance companies,
fired from all of them.

29:30.542 --> 29:31.993
I know that M.O.

29:32.044 --> 29:33.711
Ten-to-one Porter's a play doctor.

29:33.746 --> 29:35.046
Busted a few when I worked vice.

29:35.080 --> 29:37.465
EMTs who work for private
ambulance companies.

29:37.499 --> 29:39.217
They barely make 10 bucks an hour.

29:39.251 --> 29:40.551
So the ones who wanna make extra cash

29:40.586 --> 29:42.971
sometimes provide under-the-table services

29:43.005 --> 29:45.006
like patching up gangbangers.

29:45.057 --> 29:47.458
Forward Porter's picture to Olinsky asap.

29:48.928 --> 29:50.428
Huh.

29:50.462 --> 29:52.964
It's a step up from your car.

29:52.982 --> 29:54.649
State's attorney office is having

29:54.683 --> 29:56.985
their annual conference
tonight in the banquet hall.

29:57.019 --> 29:58.519
I.A. has a table.

29:58.570 --> 30:01.022
You know what the real police
call the state's attorney?

30:01.073 --> 30:02.473
203 set 'em free.

30:02.491 --> 30:05.526
You sayin' we're not the real police?

30:05.577 --> 30:06.694
McPherson.

30:06.745 --> 30:08.363
How'd that warrant work out for you?

30:08.414 --> 30:10.498
We heard you paid Gavin
Collins a visit today,

30:10.532 --> 30:11.783
and you weren't that forthcoming

30:11.817 --> 30:13.501
with his Miranda rights.

30:13.535 --> 30:14.819
We just talked, that's all.

30:14.837 --> 30:16.671
According to vice, Gavin Collins

30:16.705 --> 30:19.207
brings in trucks full
of untaxed cigarettes.

30:19.258 --> 30:20.925
You gonna bring him down?

30:20.960 --> 30:22.460
That's not on today's agenda.

30:22.494 --> 30:25.129
What is your agenda, Voight?

30:25.163 --> 30:27.498
You're supposed to be taking
down major players for us,

30:27.516 --> 30:31.836
and you can't even bust Maurice Owens?

30:31.854 --> 30:33.438
Listen, Sergeant, the only reason

30:33.472 --> 30:35.890
you got your badge back is
because of your arrangement

30:35.941 --> 30:37.525
with I.A. and the
state's attorney's office.

30:37.559 --> 30:38.977
You're going backwards.

30:39.011 --> 30:40.144
At this rate, unless you get us

30:40.178 --> 30:41.696
some heavy case on paper, you're done.

30:41.730 --> 30:44.449
I just found a disemboweled girl.

30:44.483 --> 30:47.285
I got two more out there
that could end up the same.

30:47.319 --> 30:50.788
So if you don't mind, I'd
like to get back to work.

30:53.459 --> 30:57.045
If you don't honor our deal,
you are going back to prison.

31:07.339 --> 31:09.373
- Ha, ha.
- Yeah.

31:09.391 --> 31:10.591
Yeah.

31:10.642 --> 31:13.377
Ha, ha!

31:13.395 --> 31:14.896
Hey. I gotta say it.

31:14.930 --> 31:17.181
- You da man, dog.
- Yeah, I know that, man.

31:17.215 --> 31:18.549
Come on. Hey, you got my money?

31:18.567 --> 31:20.184
- Yeah.
- Whoo.

31:20.218 --> 31:21.886
Here's half of it.

31:21.904 --> 31:23.321
She's good for the other half, man.

31:23.355 --> 31:25.523
I'll bring her back on payday.

31:25.557 --> 31:28.409
Are you that bought the bread for Sandra

31:28.444 --> 31:30.244
- over at the A-1?
- How'd you know that?

31:30.279 --> 31:32.280
It's my homey's sister, man.

31:32.331 --> 31:34.065
You know, she lost her job last year.

31:34.083 --> 31:35.583
Husband's a deadbeat.

31:35.617 --> 31:39.170
Just tryin' to do right
by the kids, you know?

31:39.204 --> 31:41.205
All right, I'll hit
you with a discount, yo.

31:41.239 --> 31:43.074
I'll just take the 250, all right?

31:43.092 --> 31:44.792
No doubt.

31:48.013 --> 31:49.130
All right.

31:49.181 --> 31:50.915
Well, I think they're closed.

31:50.933 --> 31:53.017
Maybe it's time to move
on to something else.

31:53.052 --> 31:54.385
Just lay down and shut up.

32:00.059 --> 32:01.943
Got an alert from Jin.

32:01.977 --> 32:04.428
That's great. I'll just check my phone.

32:04.446 --> 32:06.147
Oh, ho.  That's right...

32:06.198 --> 32:07.949
it took a nosedive off the roof.

32:07.983 --> 32:10.985
Get down. Get down.

32:15.991 --> 32:18.743
He's got a medical bag.

32:18.777 --> 32:20.344
Yep.

32:20.379 --> 32:22.497
That's our play doctor.

32:22.548 --> 32:25.550
And there's Sean Collins.

32:25.584 --> 32:27.969
Say "cheese," you son of a bitch.

32:30.389 --> 32:32.090
That's gotta be our girls, huh?

32:32.124 --> 32:34.058
Only one way to find out.

32:34.093 --> 32:35.843
- Told you. Patience.
- I know.

32:35.894 --> 32:38.146
- I'll call it in.
- You got it.

32:41.133 --> 32:42.867
Olinsky.

32:42.901 --> 32:44.035
We got eyes on the bad guys.

32:44.069 --> 32:45.736
They have the two girls.

32:45.754 --> 32:48.039
I repeat, looks like the
two girls are with them.

32:50.542 --> 32:53.077
Underground Ink tattoo shop, code seven.

33:03.856 --> 33:07.358
We goin' in, or what?

33:07.392 --> 33:09.477
Team's on its way.

33:09.528 --> 33:11.395
Ruzek, wait for backup.

33:11.429 --> 33:14.115
You have to wait for backup!

33:14.149 --> 33:15.399
Damn it!

33:15.433 --> 33:17.368
Chicago PD!

33:17.402 --> 33:18.769
Get your hands up!

33:18.787 --> 33:20.455
Drop that knife. Get away from her.

33:20.489 --> 33:21.873
Put your hands up. Don't move!

33:21.907 --> 33:23.607
- Back away from her.
- Don't move!

33:23.625 --> 33:25.159
Don't look at me! Hands on the wall!

33:25.210 --> 33:26.244
Hey!

33:27.629 --> 33:29.464
Collins, get down. Get down.

33:32.284 --> 33:33.718
Who else is in here, huh?

33:44.012 --> 33:46.514
We need emergency assistance. Now!

33:48.517 --> 33:50.334
All right, we got a lot of blood here, man.

33:50.352 --> 33:52.336
You're okay.

33:52.354 --> 33:54.188
Here, here.

33:54.223 --> 33:56.724
Let me see. Hang in there. I know, I know.

33:56.775 --> 33:59.143
Help is coming. An ambulance is on the way.

34:08.370 --> 34:09.853
Atwater!

34:16.210 --> 34:17.578
- Stay down!
- Get over here.

34:17.629 --> 34:20.164
Stay down!

34:21.917 --> 34:23.668
You all right?

34:25.754 --> 34:28.139
- She's bleeding pretty badly.
- I got her.

34:28.172 --> 34:30.308
I got her, officer.

34:30.342 --> 34:32.176
You're gonna be all
right, sweetheart, okay?

34:32.210 --> 34:34.312
Stay with me. All right?

34:40.264 --> 34:40.848
Move!

34:42.400 --> 34:42.976
Hey!

34:43.368 --> 34:44.534
You think you're ever gonna forget

34:44.570 --> 34:45.786
what you did to those girls?

34:45.821 --> 34:47.438
I guarantee you that
will not happen, Collins!

34:47.456 --> 34:49.824
- Erin, Erin, come on.
- Don't worry.

34:49.875 --> 34:52.743
I'll make sure this guy gets buried.

34:52.777 --> 34:54.545
You hear that? Are you listening?

34:56.215 --> 34:58.132
Hey.

34:58.167 --> 35:01.886
That's the kind of effort
that'll get you into my unit.

35:01.920 --> 35:03.287
Thank you, sir.

35:03.305 --> 35:07.625
I'll see you back at the district.

35:07.643 --> 35:08.843
Upstairs.

35:08.894 --> 35:11.229
That's what I'm talkin' about, girl.

35:13.098 --> 35:16.067
Hey. You know how stupid that was?

35:16.101 --> 35:19.153
What are you talkin' about?
If we didn't go in there,

35:19.188 --> 35:21.322
they would've killed that girl.

35:30.999 --> 35:33.334
You owe me half of that 250, by the way.

35:33.368 --> 35:34.952
You have got to be kidding me.

35:34.986 --> 35:36.504
I ain't playin'.

35:41.510 --> 35:42.993
My bad.

36:05.067 --> 36:09.820
Good news is no one was injured, Sergeant.

36:09.854 --> 36:11.789
Not yet.

36:20.549 --> 36:22.700
Erin.

36:29.213 --> 36:31.797
I got a call from Justin's
supervisor at the CTA.

36:31.831 --> 36:32.998
He said he never showed up.

36:33.016 --> 36:34.717
Yeah, he stopped by the district.

36:34.768 --> 36:37.053
I accidentally took
his wallet from the gym.

36:37.104 --> 36:38.804
It's my bad.

36:38.838 --> 36:42.191
The cell I gave him,
I've been monitoring it.

36:42.226 --> 36:44.677
He was in Statesville with Justin.

36:44.695 --> 36:47.697
Joe Catalano. He ever mention him?

36:47.731 --> 36:50.233
No, I'll ask him.

36:50.284 --> 36:52.118
I told you to keep an eye on him.

36:52.152 --> 36:54.987
Listen, if Justin finds out
that you're spying on him,

36:55.021 --> 36:57.790
he's just gonna push you away farther.

36:57.824 --> 37:00.159
I'll take care of this.

37:00.193 --> 37:01.827
You go home.

37:14.007 --> 37:15.424
Should I sneak out the fire escape?

37:19.596 --> 37:23.316
I gotta go take care
of something real quick.

37:23.350 --> 37:25.935
Thank you for being here.

37:25.986 --> 37:28.221
Today was a rough one.

37:28.255 --> 37:31.090
You've been there for me before.

37:39.283 --> 37:42.285
I might wait like five
minutes before I leave.

37:42.336 --> 37:44.870
- Sure.
- Yeah, all right.

38:10.364 --> 38:11.864
What do you want?

38:14.534 --> 38:16.535
Can I come in?

38:23.377 --> 38:27.246
So my mom is refusing to come
to the wedding, of course,

38:27.280 --> 38:29.632
but she at least came
cake shopping with us.

38:29.666 --> 38:32.117
We went with chocolate hazelnut.

38:33.720 --> 38:37.757
Wendy really wanted you to have a piece.

38:46.817 --> 38:48.234
All right.

38:48.268 --> 38:49.935
Well, I'll see you tomorrow, I guess.

38:53.940 --> 38:55.858
Al, you were right.

38:55.909 --> 38:57.360
I shouldn't have rushed
in there without you,

38:57.411 --> 39:00.029
and I'm...

39:00.080 --> 39:02.415
you know, I'm sorry.

39:04.334 --> 39:05.751
I'm really sorry.

39:05.786 --> 39:07.420
You know, I took a chance on you, man.

39:07.454 --> 39:09.321
Every... there... there are moments

39:09.339 --> 39:11.990
when I think you could be a great cop.

39:12.009 --> 39:13.292
And other moments, working with you

39:13.326 --> 39:16.512
is like spinning a cylinder
in Russian roulette.

39:16.546 --> 39:18.014
You could be right,

39:18.048 --> 39:22.051
but you can be dead right.

39:22.102 --> 39:24.387
You know what I want you to do?

39:24.438 --> 39:28.507
Go work Michigan Avenue or
some other cushy assignment.

39:28.525 --> 39:32.478
Get married, check out before
you kill the both of us.

40:06.847 --> 40:09.348
Detective Dawson.

40:09.382 --> 40:10.516
Hi.

40:14.071 --> 40:17.323
Erica Gradishar. Internal Affairs.

40:17.357 --> 40:19.658
I know who you are.

40:19.693 --> 40:21.944
I just wanted to formally introduce myself

40:21.995 --> 40:23.362
and let you know you
have a confidential place

40:23.396 --> 40:25.364
to come to if you ever need to
get something off your chest.

40:25.398 --> 40:27.583
What makes you think I need to talk?

40:27.617 --> 40:30.736
Because you're a good cop,

40:30.754 --> 40:36.074
and I hate to see a good
cop tainted by a bad one.

41:09.609 --> 41:12.411
Whatever he's having.

41:15.832 --> 41:17.800
The last time I drank with a cop,

41:17.834 --> 41:20.285
I wound up in county.

41:27.794 --> 41:29.094
I know how this works.

41:29.128 --> 41:31.430
You looked out for Justin inside,

41:31.464 --> 41:35.117
and now you think he owes you.

41:35.152 --> 41:38.003
Justin doesn't owe you anything.

41:45.245 --> 41:49.248
You can't arrest a guy for
hanging out with his friends.

41:49.282 --> 41:51.417
But I can arrest you for the 1/2 kilo

41:51.451 --> 41:54.036
I'm gonna find in your trunk.
