WEBVTT

00:01.375 --> 00:02.416
101

00:02.500 --> 00:05.250
Is this the greatest power
in the universe?

00:07.291 --> 00:09.791
MOBIUS: A fugitive Variant's been killing
our Minutemen.

00:13.208 --> 00:16.000
Whoever this Variant is,
we haven't been able to find him.

00:16.750 --> 00:20.708
LOKI: The Time Variance Authority
and the gods of Asgard, one and the same.

00:20.791 --> 00:22.750
Drunk with power, blinded to the truth.

00:22.833 --> 00:26.000
The Time-Keepers are monitoring
every aspect of this case.

00:26.083 --> 00:28.000
He's hiding in apocalypses.

00:29.208 --> 00:32.416
HUNTER B-15: You're the fool
the TVA brought in to hunt me down.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.250
Me, I presume.

00:34.333 --> 00:36.083
I'm going to overthrow the Time-Keepers.

00:36.166 --> 00:39.041
I'm not interested in ruling
the Time Variance Authority.

00:40.875 --> 00:42.166
HUNTER C-20: I gave it away.

00:42.250 --> 00:43.833
The Time-Keepers, where they are.

00:43.916 --> 00:45.041
What do you want?

00:51.541 --> 00:52.875
MOBIUS: No! No! Loki, wait!

00:52.958 --> 00:55.791
Wait! Loki, wait!

00:56.250 --> 00:57.666
No! Wait, Loki!

01:38.750 --> 01:42.208
We could do potato skins
or buffalo fingers...

01:42.291 --> 01:43.916
Or we could eat somewhere else.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.375
Why do you hate this place?

01:45.458 --> 01:47.166
I don't hate it, I fear it.

01:47.250 --> 01:48.375
Do you know how many times

01:48.458 --> 01:50.958
the health department has
closed this place down?

01:51.041 --> 01:52.500
Well, the drinks seem fine.

01:52.583 --> 01:53.666
Mmm...

01:56.583 --> 01:58.583
-Oh, God!

01:59.166 --> 02:00.166
Ah, brain freeze!

02:00.250 --> 02:02.083
You know what brain freeze is, don't you?

02:02.166 --> 02:03.166
Here we go.

02:03.250 --> 02:05.500
It's when you sip something so cold...

02:05.583 --> 02:08.125
Brain freeze associated with coldness...
Got it.

02:08.208 --> 02:09.208
Wait, I'm being serious.

02:09.291 --> 02:14.250
So, it permeates the roof of your mouth
and it freezes the synapses in your brain.

02:14.333 --> 02:17.833
So, your memories
are literally frozen in place.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.666
-That is absolutely not true.
-It is!

02:21.750 --> 02:25.333
Okay. Try it. Whatever you're thinking
about will get frozen in place.

02:25.416 --> 02:26.708
I'm gonna ask you a question,

02:26.791 --> 02:30.291
and you won't be able to answer
until the synapses have melted.

02:30.375 --> 02:31.583
Challenge accepted.

02:35.958 --> 02:37.166
Okay, ask.

02:37.250 --> 02:39.916
How many people are guarding
the Time-Keepers?

02:41.416 --> 02:42.416
I'm sorry, what?

02:49.458 --> 02:52.458
Hey, how long have we been best friends?

02:53.666 --> 02:54.666
Too long.

02:54.750 --> 02:56.958
Seriously, you know you
can tell me anything, right?

02:57.041 --> 02:58.166
Of course.

02:58.250 --> 03:01.333
Why won't you tell me how many people
are guarding the Time-Keepers?

03:01.416 --> 03:02.666
Oh, well, there's...

03:07.125 --> 03:08.125
This place, I...

03:09.291 --> 03:11.291
I remember, I know this place.

03:15.333 --> 03:16.458
But I don't know you.

03:16.541 --> 03:19.708
It's okay. You're just tired.

03:21.958 --> 03:25.125
Yeah. I'm probably just tired.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.666
How do I find the elevators?

03:30.750 --> 03:32.125
HUNTER C-20: They're gold.

04:03.166 --> 04:05.416
All Minutemen to armory.

04:05.500 --> 04:07.000
Protect the timeline.

04:09.958 --> 04:12.083
All Minutemen to armory.

04:12.166 --> 04:13.458
Protect the timeline.

04:17.750 --> 04:18.833
MINUTEMAN: I don't know, sir.

04:52.750 --> 04:54.958
ANNOUNCER: All Minutemen to armory.

04:55.041 --> 04:56.416
Protect the timeline.

05:24.208 --> 05:26.083
Hey! Stop!

05:43.625 --> 05:44.958
A few questions.

05:45.041 --> 05:46.875
Have you got nothing else to do?

05:46.958 --> 05:48.291
Rude.

05:50.125 --> 05:51.833
Are you sure you're a Loki?

05:51.916 --> 05:53.666
-You're in my way.
-You are my way.

05:57.916 --> 06:00.000
I thought perhaps we could work together.

06:06.333 --> 06:09.041
But now I see you lack vision.

06:11.666 --> 06:13.458
So, either you'll come willingly...

06:16.250 --> 06:19.000
Or you won't. Either way,
that's how I get to the Time-Keepers.

06:19.083 --> 06:20.458
Oh, God. Shut up!

06:20.541 --> 06:22.583
-RENSLAYER: Hey!

06:26.583 --> 06:28.125
Come any closer and I'll kill him.

06:28.791 --> 06:30.833
-Go for it.
-

06:45.208 --> 06:46.458
Get off my leg!

06:52.000 --> 06:53.916
Goodbye, Variant.

06:55.083 --> 06:58.166
-MISS MINUTES: You're outta juice.
-

06:58.250 --> 06:59.458
It's not working.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
-LOKI: Right...
-

07:10.083 --> 07:12.666
Give It To me.
You don't know how to Recharge it.

07:12.750 --> 07:15.666
Of course I do.
You're not the only tech savvy Loki.

07:15.750 --> 07:16.958
Don't ever call me that.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.875
-Tech savvy?
-No, a Loki.

07:22.875 --> 07:24.333
You're just fully a magician then?

07:24.416 --> 07:28.333
Fine. For my next trick,
I'll make you disappear.

07:32.958 --> 07:35.416
-Is that one of your powers?
-Where did you send us?

08:01.875 --> 08:04.041
You idiot! This is Lamentis 1.

08:04.125 --> 08:05.375
I don't know what that means!

08:06.833 --> 08:09.625
The moon that planet is about to
crash into and destroy.

08:10.833 --> 08:14.208
Of all of the apocalypses
saved on that TemPad, this is the worst!

08:14.291 --> 08:16.041
No one makes it off here!

08:16.125 --> 08:17.500
-

08:18.166 --> 08:21.208
I'm sorry, madam.
Didn't have time to scan the brochure.

08:22.583 --> 08:24.541
By the way, I thought you wanted me dead.

08:24.625 --> 08:26.291
I don't know where you hid that TemPad,

08:26.375 --> 08:29.083
but if you blow up, it blows up,
and then I end up blown up.

08:29.166 --> 08:30.708
There!

08:30.791 --> 08:32.791
-So we're a team now?
-Oh, God, no!

08:34.875 --> 08:36.000
-Get down!
-

08:36.916 --> 08:38.291
Didn't need your help!

08:38.375 --> 08:39.833
You're so weird!

09:20.625 --> 09:21.833
What are you doing?

09:22.375 --> 09:23.583
What are you doing?

09:24.375 --> 09:25.916
You trying to enchant me?

09:27.791 --> 09:29.041
It won't work.

09:29.791 --> 09:31.333
Why? Because you're a magician?

09:31.416 --> 09:34.166
-No, because my mind is too strong.
-Fine!

09:36.791 --> 09:39.750
Look. Are we really
about to do this here? Again?

09:39.875 --> 09:41.208
What do you propose instead?

09:41.291 --> 09:42.458
I don't know. A truce?

09:43.875 --> 09:46.208
LOKI: Listen, neither of us
is getting off this rock

09:46.291 --> 09:47.833
if we can't turn that TemPad on.

09:47.916 --> 09:49.333
Where do you have it hidden?

09:49.416 --> 09:51.583
-In my heart.
-Well, then, I'll cut it out.

09:51.666 --> 09:53.541
Nice. Very droll. Lovely.

09:54.416 --> 09:56.833
Okay, yes, I do have the TemPad,

09:56.916 --> 09:59.916
but I'm not gonna get very far
if you keep trying to kill me.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.833
You're full of it because
you need me to get that recharged.

10:02.916 --> 10:05.541
That's the only reason
you saved me out there.

10:06.875 --> 10:08.000
Maybe.

10:08.083 --> 10:10.250
Yeah. I mean, sure. That too.

10:11.125 --> 10:14.333
Or we could slaughter each other here
in this abandoned mining shack.

10:14.416 --> 10:16.333
-What do you say?
-Good for me.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.958
The plan you interrupted
was years in the making.

10:24.666 --> 10:26.333
-Years!
-Okay, got it.

10:26.416 --> 10:28.583
And as soon as I turn that TemPad back on,

10:28.666 --> 10:32.416
I'm going straight back to the TVA
to finish what I started.

10:32.500 --> 10:33.541
Good.

10:33.625 --> 10:35.791
-I'll kill you then.
-Or I'll kill you.

10:37.916 --> 10:38.916
Where're you going?

10:39.750 --> 10:41.625
There's power somewhere on this moon.

10:41.708 --> 10:44.875
We just need enough to travel
through inter-dimensional time and space.

10:47.833 --> 10:48.833
Jeez!

10:49.208 --> 10:50.250
Yep.

11:03.333 --> 11:05.125
So, what's the plan?

11:06.041 --> 11:08.416
There's a town near here.
And can you shut up?

11:08.500 --> 11:11.750
Just because I have to work with you
doesn't mean I wanna hear your voice.

11:11.833 --> 11:15.458
All right, well... Slow down, Variant.

11:15.541 --> 11:18.333
What part of imminent death confuses you?

11:18.916 --> 11:20.333
And don't call me "Variant."

11:21.083 --> 11:25.125
I'm sorry, but I'm not calling
some faded photocopy of me "Loki."

11:25.208 --> 11:29.375
Good. 'Cause that's not who I am anymore.
I'm Sylvie now.

11:30.041 --> 11:31.458
You changed your name. Brilliant.

11:31.541 --> 11:32.541
It's called an alias.

11:32.625 --> 11:33.708
It's not very Loki-like.

11:33.791 --> 11:36.875
Yeah? What exactly makes a Loki a Loki?

11:36.958 --> 11:40.958
Independence, authority, style.

11:41.041 --> 11:44.041
SYLVIE: So, naturally you went to work
for the boring, oppressive time police.

11:44.125 --> 11:46.291
LOKI: I don't work for them.
I'm a consultant.

11:46.833 --> 11:48.291
SYLVIE: You don't know what you want.

11:48.375 --> 11:49.583
Oh, yeah? What about you?

11:50.625 --> 11:54.166
Your years-in-the-making plan
was to tear the place down,

11:54.250 --> 11:58.083
create the ultimate power vacuum,
and then just walk away.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.250
I'd never have done that.

12:00.333 --> 12:02.083
Yeah? Well, I'm not you.

12:03.250 --> 12:04.958
Can we get on with this now?

12:15.166 --> 12:17.000
LOKI: It looks like everyone already fled.

12:17.458 --> 12:19.083
SYLVIE: If they did, it was in vain.

12:20.625 --> 12:21.916
LOKI: How long do we have?

12:22.000 --> 12:25.916
SYLVIE: Twelve hours or so.
Things down here are only gonna get worse.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.625
More meteors, gravity quakes,

12:28.708 --> 12:32.041
and of course, the collapse of society
in the face of annihilation.

12:34.708 --> 12:36.250
Could that charge the TemPad?

12:36.791 --> 12:37.791
Maybe.

12:43.416 --> 12:46.125
I'm just checking the coupling.
Making sure it can connect.

12:46.208 --> 12:47.375
Right.

12:48.166 --> 12:49.541
Okay. Hand it over.

12:52.583 --> 12:55.916
Pitiful. I'm not giving it to you.
You're gonna have to try harder.

12:57.250 --> 13:00.208
Then don't give me
your "tech savvy" ideas either.

13:00.875 --> 13:04.833
The TemPad requires
a massive power source, not a night light.

13:33.041 --> 13:36.958
Brute force is no substitute
for diplomacy and guile.

13:37.625 --> 13:38.791
Noted.

13:49.791 --> 13:53.000
It's remarkable
that you ever made it as far as you did.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.250
Sorry about that.

13:55.333 --> 13:57.833
Don't be. I enjoyed it.

13:57.916 --> 13:59.750
I did too.

13:59.833 --> 14:01.208
But I can assure you,

14:01.291 --> 14:04.666
despite my acquaintance
behaving like an animal...

14:05.833 --> 14:09.083
...uh, we mean you no harm.
We're simply weary travelers.

14:09.166 --> 14:10.250
Sure you are.

14:25.583 --> 14:26.750
MAN: Hello, dear.

14:28.041 --> 14:29.041
Patrice?

14:32.166 --> 14:34.958
It... It's been a long time.

14:36.083 --> 14:37.375
You're as beautiful as...

14:44.791 --> 14:48.000
WOMAN: Patrice never said
a thing that nice in 30 years.

14:49.041 --> 14:51.333
You're no travelers, you're devils.

14:52.958 --> 14:54.625
Which one was that? Diplomacy?

14:54.708 --> 14:57.291
-Don't. Just don't.

15:02.958 --> 15:04.875
What do you devils want with me?

15:05.750 --> 15:09.208
We just wanna ask you a question.
Where is everyone?

15:10.375 --> 15:11.375
The ark.

15:14.916 --> 15:17.375
The evacuation vessel.

15:18.416 --> 15:21.833
Something like that would have
enough juice to repower the TemPad.

15:24.166 --> 15:25.375
How do we get there?

15:27.000 --> 15:31.833
Train station's the edge of town.
But you'll never get a ticket.

15:33.333 --> 15:34.458
Come on, let's go.

15:54.541 --> 15:55.541
GUARD: Quiet down!

15:58.416 --> 15:59.500
Get back!

15:59.833 --> 16:01.333
What's going on?

16:01.666 --> 16:05.333
The ark leaves tonight
and we've been waiting in line for hours.

16:06.333 --> 16:07.750
For hours.

16:09.666 --> 16:11.041
Well, this looks fun.

16:11.750 --> 16:12.791
Come on.

16:13.291 --> 16:15.000
We can't fight our way onto that train.

16:15.083 --> 16:16.541
Who said anything about fighting?

16:16.625 --> 16:18.916
-All your plans involve fighting.
-Not this one.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.416
I'm going to enchant a guard,
have him lead us through the crowd,

16:22.500 --> 16:24.541
and if anyone gives us any trouble...

16:24.625 --> 16:26.083
Make him start shooting?

16:26.166 --> 16:29.000
And then what, kill every guard
and hijack the train?

16:29.083 --> 16:31.791
Whether or not there's a fight
is entirely up to them.

16:32.541 --> 16:35.583
We're doing this one my way.

16:38.208 --> 16:40.541
-How do I look?
-Like someone with a shit plan.

16:40.625 --> 16:41.916
-It's a great plan.
-Hmm.

16:42.625 --> 16:44.250
Just follow my lead.

16:45.833 --> 16:48.250
WOMAN: Why can't we get on?
MAN: Let us in! Come on!

16:48.458 --> 16:50.250
GUARD: To Shuroo? This way, sir.

16:50.333 --> 16:52.916
MAN 2: Let us in! Women and children...

16:54.083 --> 16:57.291
They're only giving tickets out
to the wealthy!

16:57.375 --> 16:59.333
What about us?

17:03.166 --> 17:04.458
GUARD: Tickets?

17:12.291 --> 17:14.000
Whoa! Hey!

17:14.916 --> 17:16.500
Taking this one to Shuroo.

17:16.583 --> 17:19.541
Okay. And the tickets?

17:19.625 --> 17:21.708
Orders come from the top
to get her on this train.

17:22.333 --> 17:23.833
Sir, this...

17:25.958 --> 17:27.125
Everything okay?

17:27.208 --> 17:28.541
Yeah, everything's fine.

17:28.625 --> 17:31.625
Yeah, I just remembered
that headquarters radioed in

17:31.708 --> 17:33.666
their request for them this morning.

17:38.916 --> 17:40.000
Okay.

17:41.208 --> 17:42.250
Okay.

17:45.291 --> 17:46.333
GUARD: Tickets?

17:55.458 --> 17:57.708
Good evening, passengers. Hi.

18:01.583 --> 18:04.208
Um, uh, look,
I can't go backwards on a train.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.125
Well, I never sit with my back to a door.

18:06.208 --> 18:08.708
What? There are doors on both sides.

18:08.791 --> 18:10.416
Oh, just sit down.

18:13.666 --> 18:15.375
FYI, that wasn't even a plan.

18:15.458 --> 18:16.458
Oh, really?

18:16.541 --> 18:18.041
Plans have multiple steps.

18:18.125 --> 18:21.375
Dressing as a guard and getting on a train
is just doing a thing.

18:25.666 --> 18:28.791
Oh, you a bit tired?
Feel free to, you know, get some rest.

18:31.666 --> 18:33.458
I can't sleep in a place like this.

18:34.375 --> 18:35.708
You can't sleep on a train?

18:35.791 --> 18:38.583
No. I can't sleep around
untrustworthy people.

18:38.666 --> 18:40.208
Oh, right. That me?

18:40.291 --> 18:41.958
But you feel free to take a nap.

18:42.583 --> 18:43.875
Nice try.

18:43.958 --> 18:46.708
I'm not gonna waste my time
rooting around for the TemPad

18:46.791 --> 18:49.416
when someone taught you
fairly decent magic.

18:49.500 --> 18:50.500
My mother.

18:59.458 --> 19:00.625
What was she like?

19:03.541 --> 19:05.666
She was, um...

19:10.041 --> 19:12.041
A Queen of Asgard.

19:13.333 --> 19:16.916
She was good. Purely decent.

19:18.666 --> 19:21.166
Are you sure she was your mother?

19:21.250 --> 19:23.166
Oh, no, she's not actually. I was adopted.

19:23.250 --> 19:25.458
Is that a bit of a spoiler for you?
Sorry about that.

19:25.541 --> 19:27.083
No, I knew I was adopted.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.250
What? They told you?

19:29.333 --> 19:32.625
-SYLVIE: Yeah. Did they not tell you?
-No.

19:34.333 --> 19:36.708
I mean, they did, eventually.

19:37.458 --> 19:41.708
Hang on a second.
So, tell... Tell me about your mother.

19:42.333 --> 19:43.791
I barely remember her.

19:44.541 --> 19:46.750
Just blips of a dream at this point.

19:53.041 --> 19:57.250
You know, when I was young, she'd do
these little bits of magic for me.

19:58.833 --> 20:04.250
Like turn a flower into a frog
or cast fireworks over the water.

20:05.458 --> 20:06.750
It all seemed impossible.

20:06.833 --> 20:09.375
She told me that
I'd be able to do it too because...

20:11.416 --> 20:12.875
Because I could do anything.

20:16.041 --> 20:17.791
You wanna see?

20:25.333 --> 20:26.500
Not bad.

20:32.291 --> 20:35.375
She was the kinda person
you'd want to believe in you.

20:36.125 --> 20:37.541
Sounds like she does.

20:39.125 --> 20:40.291
Well, she did.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.833
So, where'd you learn to do the...

20:46.916 --> 20:50.000
-You know, the... Whatever it is?
-I taught myself.

20:50.083 --> 20:52.458
-You taught yourself that magic?
-Yeah, I did.

20:54.375 --> 20:55.541
What, do you just...

20:55.625 --> 20:59.458
You just go into their minds
and project some sort of illusion?

20:59.541 --> 21:00.875
It'd be easier if I just...

21:00.958 --> 21:03.500
Enchanted me and take the TemPad
and leap out the train?

21:03.583 --> 21:05.208
-No, thank you.
-Well then, don't ask.

21:05.291 --> 21:06.750
Okay.
-Champagne?

21:06.833 --> 21:09.333
Ah, yes. Thank you very much.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.083
No, I'm good, thanks.

21:11.166 --> 21:13.541
Oh, I'll take hers. Thank you.

21:15.083 --> 21:16.083
Cheers.

21:18.041 --> 21:19.666
To the end of the world.

21:23.083 --> 21:25.583
A pity the old woman chose to die,
don't you think?

21:25.666 --> 21:28.500
-She was in love.
-She hated him.

21:28.583 --> 21:30.041
Maybe love is hate.

21:31.833 --> 21:33.750
Should probably remember that.

21:34.541 --> 21:36.708
What was that? "Love is..."

21:36.791 --> 21:38.875
-"Love is hate."
-Oh, piss off!

21:42.666 --> 21:45.500
So, on the subject of love,

21:46.333 --> 21:50.375
is there a lucky beau waiting for you
at the end of this crusade?

21:51.041 --> 21:52.916
-Yeah, there is, actually.
-Oh.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.708
Managed to maintain quite a serious
long-distance relationship with a postman

21:56.791 --> 21:58.166
whilst running across time...

21:58.250 --> 22:00.250
-...from one apocalypse to another.

22:00.333 --> 22:02.833
With charm like that,
who could resist you?

22:02.916 --> 22:06.375
Well, people are quite willing
in the face of certain doom.

22:06.458 --> 22:07.750
I'm sure they are.

22:09.250 --> 22:11.583
It was only ever just to keep me going.

22:13.083 --> 22:16.166
How about you? You're a prince.

22:16.250 --> 22:21.583
Must've been would-be-princesses
or perhaps, another prince.

22:24.916 --> 22:28.375
A bit of both. I suspect the same as you.

22:28.458 --> 22:30.125
But, nothing ever...

22:30.208 --> 22:31.375
Real.

22:33.625 --> 22:34.875
Mmm...

22:37.166 --> 22:38.750
Love is mischief, then.

22:43.083 --> 22:44.208
No.

22:47.250 --> 22:49.416
Love is...

22:54.458 --> 22:59.166
uh, something I might have
to have another drink to think about.

23:00.458 --> 23:02.250
You do realize
we're about to try and hijack

23:02.333 --> 23:05.041
the power source
to a civilization's only hope?

23:05.125 --> 23:06.875
-I do.
-It's not gonna be easy.

23:06.958 --> 23:08.125
We should rest.

23:08.208 --> 23:11.833
All right. You relax your way
and I'll relax mine.

23:36.125 --> 23:37.750
She sings, she sings come home

23:37.833 --> 23:39.958
When she sings, she sings come home

23:44.333 --> 23:45.875
Where's your uniform?

23:46.208 --> 23:49.541
When she sings, she sings come home
When she sings, she sings come home

23:49.625 --> 23:53.625
When she sings, she sings come home
When she sings, she sings come home

24:35.416 --> 24:40.666
When she sings, she sings come home
When she sings, she sings come home

24:40.750 --> 24:43.458
-To Sylvie, everybody!
-MAN: Yeah!

24:45.458 --> 24:47.458
Another!
-

24:52.208 --> 24:53.291
You're drunk.

24:53.375 --> 24:54.916
No, I'm just full.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.541
But bear in mind, I'm very full.

24:57.625 --> 25:00.250
Now, I need you to try this.

25:00.333 --> 25:02.666
It pairs very nicely with the Figgy Port.

25:02.750 --> 25:04.416
Who's got the Figgy Port?

25:05.208 --> 25:07.083
You have to take my word
on the Figgy Port.

25:07.166 --> 25:09.375
Where's your uniform?
We're meant to be laying low.

25:09.458 --> 25:11.625
Nobody cares. It's the end of the world.

25:11.708 --> 25:13.708
-I think something's happening.
-Yes.

25:13.791 --> 25:16.125
Uh, that planet is about to crash into us.

25:16.208 --> 25:19.083
Don't be an ass.
I saw some people looking at you weirdly.

25:19.166 --> 25:20.333
What?

25:21.500 --> 25:23.125
When did you get so paranoid?

25:23.208 --> 25:25.375
It must have started
when I spent my entire life

25:25.458 --> 25:27.875
running from the omniscient fascists
you work for.

25:29.625 --> 25:31.250
It's a shame to let that go to waste.

25:32.166 --> 25:35.666
Hey! Change of subject.
I thought of an answer.

25:35.750 --> 25:36.791
To what?

25:36.875 --> 25:38.291
Your question.

25:41.958 --> 25:44.791
Love is a dagger.

25:46.208 --> 25:51.500
It's a weapon
to be wielded far away or up close.

25:52.291 --> 25:55.583
You can see yourself in it.
It's beautiful.

25:57.791 --> 25:59.666
Until it makes you bleed.

26:00.916 --> 26:03.416
But ultimately, when you reach for it...

26:07.500 --> 26:09.583
-It isn't real.
-Yeah.

26:09.666 --> 26:10.916
Love is an imaginary dagger.

26:12.166 --> 26:13.375
Doesn't make sense, does it?

26:13.458 --> 26:15.041
No. Terrible metaphor.

26:15.125 --> 26:18.166
-Damn. I thought I had something there.
-

26:18.875 --> 26:19.875
That's him.

26:19.958 --> 26:21.625
-Stay cool.
-It's gonna be fine.

26:21.708 --> 26:23.500
Sir, can I see your tickets?

26:26.416 --> 26:28.583
You again. Hello.

26:28.666 --> 26:32.833
Um, tickets.
Yes, of course. Here they are.

26:36.708 --> 26:37.791
Oops.

26:37.875 --> 26:39.541
Still, it looks lovely, doesn't it?

26:39.625 --> 26:42.375
Look, is this really necessary?
There is a simple explanation...

26:43.583 --> 26:44.625
-Hey.
-GUARD: Huh?

26:44.708 --> 26:46.041
What? Hey!

26:49.083 --> 26:50.250
GUARD: Get out of the way.

27:23.291 --> 27:25.541
-Awful throw.
-

27:25.625 --> 27:26.750
Oh, will you stop it?

27:32.000 --> 27:33.083
Bye.

27:38.541 --> 27:40.000
TemPad.

27:59.916 --> 28:02.083
Well, that's not ideal.

28:02.166 --> 28:05.375
-Give me the TemPad.
-All right. All right. Okay.

28:13.666 --> 28:15.416
Well, I did take quite the tumble.

28:15.500 --> 28:17.791
You asshole. You killed us.

28:17.875 --> 28:20.166
Maybe we can fix it. Okay? Um...

28:23.625 --> 28:24.916
You're not a serious man.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.291
You're right. I'm a god.

28:26.375 --> 28:29.250
You're a clown.
You got drunk on the train.

28:29.333 --> 28:32.166
-I'm hedonistic. That's what I do.
-I'm hedonistic.

28:32.250 --> 28:36.083
A lot more than you, I assure you.
But never at the expense of the mission.

28:36.166 --> 28:38.041
Oh, the mission? The mission?

28:38.125 --> 28:41.375
What, your glorious purpose?
Give me a break. You can't beat them.

29:00.166 --> 29:01.250
Okay.

29:39.125 --> 29:42.250
Did the, uh, scream make you feel better?

29:47.750 --> 29:49.750
Yes, it did.

29:51.208 --> 29:52.791
You should try it sometime.

29:58.208 --> 29:59.541
What now?

29:59.625 --> 30:02.083
-I don't know. You broke the TemPad.
-Well...

30:02.166 --> 30:05.041
And that planet is about to crash into us.

30:06.041 --> 30:08.416
-Well, yes, but...
-Yes, but what?

30:08.500 --> 30:10.875
Well, the entire moon is destroyed, right?

30:10.958 --> 30:13.333
Yeah. And everyone on it is killed.

30:13.416 --> 30:15.875
-Including us.
-Yes, including us.

30:19.875 --> 30:21.250
What about the ark?

30:22.458 --> 30:24.791
The ark never leaves
because it's destroyed.

30:27.166 --> 30:29.000
Never had us on it.

30:32.791 --> 30:36.791
So what? We hijack the ark
and make sure it gets off this moon?

30:39.416 --> 30:41.541
I mean, sounds like a good idea to me.

30:45.125 --> 30:46.166
Okay.

30:48.166 --> 30:49.250
Really?

31:05.291 --> 31:09.125
You know, I don't think
I've ever walked this much in my life.

31:09.208 --> 31:10.583
That's a pretty good life.

31:10.666 --> 31:12.666
Well, you're lucky you missed it.

31:12.750 --> 31:17.583
Here's an idea. What if you enchanted me
and you could walk for both of us?

31:17.666 --> 31:19.375
Or I take a nap in my subconscious,

31:19.458 --> 31:21.958
and then you could just wake me
when we arrive. Yeah?

31:22.041 --> 31:23.958
Yeah, that's not how enchantment works.

31:24.041 --> 31:25.708
All right, how does it work?

31:25.791 --> 31:27.375
Doesn't matter.

31:27.458 --> 31:31.500
You know, I feel like
I've told you so much about me.

31:31.583 --> 31:33.583
I really don't know
the first thing about you.

31:33.666 --> 31:35.083
Thanks for the tactical advantage.

31:35.166 --> 31:38.958
LOKI: Ah, so, you want to use
that tactical advantage to kill me

31:39.041 --> 31:40.166
when the TVA shows up.

31:40.250 --> 31:41.708
Worried, are you?

31:41.791 --> 31:43.875
I just need to know if I can trust you.

31:48.166 --> 31:49.375
Okay, fine.

31:50.125 --> 31:52.500
You want to know how enchantment works.

31:53.125 --> 31:57.291
I have to make physical contact
and then grab hold of their mind.

31:58.250 --> 31:59.291
How?

31:59.375 --> 32:00.791
It depends on the mind.

32:00.875 --> 32:03.916
Most are easy
and I can overtake them instantly.

32:04.000 --> 32:07.541
Others, the stronger ones, it gets tricky.

32:07.625 --> 32:10.500
I'm in control, but they're there, too.

32:10.583 --> 32:12.416
In order to preserve the connection,

32:12.500 --> 32:15.250
I have to create a fantasy
from their memories.

32:17.708 --> 32:19.583
And you call me a magician.

32:20.750 --> 32:24.875
That young soldier from the TVA,
her mind was messed up.

32:24.958 --> 32:26.500
Everything clouded.

32:26.583 --> 32:29.333
I had to pull a memory
from hundreds of years prior,

32:29.416 --> 32:31.541
before she even fought for them.

32:31.625 --> 32:34.041
What? What'd you just say?

32:34.833 --> 32:36.583
Before she joined the TVA?

32:36.666 --> 32:38.625
Yeah. She was just
a regular person on Earth.

32:38.708 --> 32:39.875
A regular person?

32:39.958 --> 32:41.500
Loved margaritas.

32:42.208 --> 32:44.541
I was told that
everyone who works for the TVA

32:44.625 --> 32:46.416
was created by the Time-Keepers.

32:46.500 --> 32:49.916
That's ridiculous.
They're all Variants, just like us.

32:50.375 --> 32:51.625
They don't know that.

32:51.708 --> 32:53.666
ANNOUNCER: All ticketed passengers...

32:53.750 --> 32:55.125
SYLVIE: That's our ride.

32:55.208 --> 32:57.083
ANNOUNCER: Ten minutes until launch.

33:01.916 --> 33:03.416
Final boarding call.

33:05.750 --> 33:07.125
SYLVIE: Do we trust each other?

33:07.208 --> 33:09.583
LOKI: We do and you can.

33:11.375 --> 33:14.583
Good. Because this is gonna suck.

33:16.250 --> 33:19.416
GUARD: Remain calm. We're now at capacity.

33:19.500 --> 33:21.375
Please return to your homes.

33:22.125 --> 33:23.208
Stand back!

33:23.291 --> 33:24.666
Let us on!

33:24.750 --> 33:25.750
Let us on!

33:25.833 --> 33:27.833
ANNOUNCER: Five minutes until launch.

33:27.916 --> 33:29.958
LOKI: They're gonna let these people die.

33:31.541 --> 33:33.291
ANNOUNCER: Five minutes until launch.

33:33.375 --> 33:35.708
SYLVIE: We have to get on
and make sure it takes off.

33:35.791 --> 33:36.916
How?

33:38.375 --> 33:39.750
SYLVIE: We go around.
LOKI: Okay.

33:46.875 --> 33:48.458
GUARD: Return to your homes.

33:50.791 --> 33:51.791
