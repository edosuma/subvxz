a person keeps on sneezing?

00:40.774 --> 00:42.410
Like a-choo, a-choo, a-choo.

00:42.443 --> 00:43.644
It's like, how many
times do I have

00:43.677 --> 00:44.678

God Bless you?

00:54.855 --> 00:56.824
Is there such a thing as

you love 'em.

Wait, is this a
cooking challenge?

01:05.366 --> 01:06.834
- No, Desiree and I are
making you breakfast

01:06.867 --> 01:08.869
to thank you both
for your hospitality.

01:08.902 --> 01:12.140
- There's buttermilk pancakes,
bacon, and biscuits and gravy,

01:12.173 --> 01:15.209
- That's so nice, but I don't
think I've made it back

01:15.243 --> 01:18.146
to that level of the
food pyramid yet, so...

01:18.179 --> 01:19.613
I think I'm gonna
stick with my smoothie.

- And I always have my frozen
microwavable breakfast sandwich.

I cannot take their voices.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.497
They work in the same

other down the hall every day.

Could you get their autograph
for my collection?

right on that.

The Times-Press does not
interview just anybody.

but it still feels good.

in the family, Rem.

of room in my freezer.

I was going to buy a
bigger one this week.

her breast milk.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.249
She sells it on-line.

02:28.282 --> 02:30.184
- I make sure to only
sell to women.

- Okay, I'm just confused
why she's so...

03:19.933 --> 03:20.768
Here.

03:20.801 --> 03:23.003
- She and Destiny
moved in with me.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.238
We're in love.

03:24.272 --> 03:27.275
So it'd be great if y'all could
accept her into your lives.

03:27.308 --> 03:28.909
- I didn't know she
was in my life.

03:28.942 --> 03:31.712
- Well, she is, she's part
of our family now,

03:31.745 --> 03:32.813
and so is the baby.

03:32.846 --> 03:33.981
- So I'm an aunt.

03:34.014 --> 03:36.517
- You're the one that told me
I should go out with her.

03:36.550 --> 03:39.887
- One date. I mean,
I don't even understand

03:39.920 --> 03:41.455
what's going on with you.

03:41.489 --> 03:43.557
- Your sudden religious zeal.

03:43.591 --> 03:46.827
Your immediate cohabitation
with a person

03:46.860 --> 03:50.531
who appears to be extremely
different from you.

03:50.564 --> 03:51.432

even cook?

03:59.907 --> 04:02.510
I mean, wouldn't he just
turn something into dinner?

04:03.544 --> 04:07.381
- Who cares about some stupid
detail like her apron, Tig?

04:07.415 --> 04:10.318
- Details add up to
create a whole.

04:10.351 --> 04:12.553
- Yeah, of a person
you don't even know.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.555

That's all I'm saying.

some sort of breakdown?

04:21.495 --> 04:24.998
- No, Tig, this is me, happy.

04:37.878 --> 04:41.014

04:41.048 --> 04:41.915
Apparently,
it's one of

04:41.949 --> 04:43.784

be a perfect place

04:45.886 --> 04:47.555

revised your position on things.

with the Nest.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.554
- What is the difficulty?

07:00.588 --> 07:01.822
- I correctly set the schedule

07:01.855 --> 07:04.157
for my preferred temperature
and times.

07:04.191 --> 07:06.026
It's behaving
as if I had not.

07:06.059 --> 07:08.061
- Did you set it
on the thermostat itself,

07:08.095 --> 07:09.930
or on the app?
- I tried both.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.765
It continues to go rogue.

07:11.799 --> 07:13.934
- Well, does it start at
the time for which it was set?

07:13.967 --> 07:16.704
- Yes, but the time
that it is set

07:16.737 --> 07:17.838
is not the time for
which I set it.

07:17.871 --> 07:20.674
- Well, if it starts at
the time for which it was set,

07:20.708 --> 07:22.075
it is not defective.

07:22.109 --> 07:25.178
You simply have not mastered
how to set it.

07:25.212 --> 07:26.480
- Oh?

07:26.514 --> 07:29.016
- The dial is sensitive,
but accurate.

07:29.049 --> 07:31.184
I suggest you try
setting it again.

07:31.218 --> 07:32.986
- I have already reset it twice.

07:33.020 --> 07:36.156
- Then do it once more and
this time take extra care

07:36.189 --> 07:37.525
to do it correctly.

07:37.558 --> 07:39.727
- It would be impossible

07:39.760 --> 07:42.930
for me to take more care
than I already have.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.537

if that does not work.

it will not.
