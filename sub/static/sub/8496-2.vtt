00:02.967 --> 00:04.067
Previously

00:04.133 --> 00:05.067
on "Hit the Floor"...

00:05.133 --> 00:06.067
I'm fighting
for what I want.

00:06.133 --> 00:07.067
You talking
about your deal?

00:07.133 --> 00:08.867
I'm talking about you.

00:08.933 --> 00:10.333
Will you marry me?

00:10.400 --> 00:12.667
Yes, I will
marry you.

00:12.733 --> 00:14.500
I'm accepting
the EVP job.

00:14.567 --> 00:17.800
EVP, that makes
you my boss.

00:17.867 --> 00:18.933
That's hot.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.867
Welcome back to
the Devil Girls, Raquel.

00:21.933 --> 00:24.200
"50 Shades of Kyle", it's
gonna be made into a movie!

00:24.267 --> 00:25.767
I hope he hangs.

00:25.833 --> 00:27.333
As lead witness
in the case against him,

00:27.400 --> 00:28.867
you'll ensure he does
just that.

00:28.933 --> 00:31.633
You put me in this seat,
but I'm not your puppet.

00:31.700 --> 00:34.333
Lionel, she could ruin
the whole organization.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.967
The league obviously
knows what they have
on their hands in L.A.

00:37.033 --> 00:39.700
I want you to get off
your asses and force a sale,

00:39.767 --> 00:41.900
and get the Kinkades
out of Devils Arena

00:41.967 --> 00:42.933
once and for all.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.333
We want to
buy the Devils,

00:44.400 --> 00:45.533
and we will do

00:45.600 --> 00:48.533
whatever it takes
to do it.

00:48.600 --> 00:52.000
Can you imagine?
Getting away with murder?

00:53.400 --> 00:56.100
Why were you
calling out Olivia?

01:11.500 --> 01:13.800
You called out
Olivia's name.

01:13.867 --> 01:16.100
What are you
talking about?

01:16.167 --> 01:18.467
You said "Olivia"
three times.

01:18.533 --> 01:22.167
It was--
it was nothing.

01:22.233 --> 01:23.833
Wasn't nothing,
you lurched up.

01:23.900 --> 01:27.500
You're-- you're
covered in sweat.

01:27.567 --> 01:31.800
I mean, we were...

01:31.867 --> 01:34.100
we were just talking
about her before bed.

01:34.167 --> 01:35.700
She must have been
on my mind.

01:35.767 --> 01:37.100
You weren't just
saying her name.

01:37.167 --> 01:41.633
You were yelling it
like you were yelling at her.

01:41.700 --> 01:43.200
What were you dreaming?

01:48.067 --> 01:49.867
That she wanted
to hurt you.

02:14.100 --> 02:16.367
So... that stunt,

02:16.433 --> 02:19.067
telling me you weren't signing
right before the ring ceremony,

02:19.067 --> 02:20.933
was that supposed
to be cute?

02:21.067 --> 02:23.300
Why, do you think
it was cute?
Well, I don't know.

02:23.367 --> 02:25.967
Is riding the bench until
you ass is chapped cute?

02:26.067 --> 02:27.467
Riding the bench?

02:27.533 --> 02:28.933
The season starts
in two days.

02:29.067 --> 02:30.767
And if you don't have
a signed contract by then,

02:30.833 --> 02:32.433
you can't play.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.933
For opening game, that means
midnight tomorrow.

02:35.067 --> 02:36.200
Ah, come on,
that's plenty of time

02:36.267 --> 02:38.367
for you to come up
with a better deal.

02:38.433 --> 02:40.067
I mean, I'd love to talk
to you more about it,

02:40.067 --> 02:42.067
but my agent's advised me
not to talk to you directly.

02:42.067 --> 02:43.700
You have two days
to figure this out.

02:43.767 --> 02:45.733
Yeah.
Actually, you...

02:45.800 --> 02:48.333
have two days
to figure this out.

02:49.833 --> 02:52.433
Lionel?
You have a moment?

02:52.500 --> 02:55.667
Now is not a good time, Adam.
I am not sure
there is a good time

02:55.733 --> 02:57.967
for what I have
to tell you.

02:58.067 --> 03:00.300
The league is gearing up
to force a sale.

03:00.367 --> 03:01.867
Force?

03:01.933 --> 03:03.300
We know how hard
you've been working

03:03.367 --> 03:05.467
running the Devils
in Oscar's absence.

03:05.533 --> 03:06.500
We appreciate it.

03:06.567 --> 03:09.067
I'm not selling.

03:09.100 --> 03:11.533
And I'd be real careful
about patronizing me.

03:11.600 --> 03:14.367
Oscar Kinkade is in prison
awaiting trial for murder,

03:14.433 --> 03:16.333
and the person
currently in his seat

03:16.400 --> 03:18.700
is a Hollywood actress
with no experience

03:18.767 --> 03:19.967
running a franchise.

03:20.067 --> 03:21.467
I've been more
in more back rooms

03:21.533 --> 03:24.533
with more powerful people than
you could ever hope to meet.

03:24.600 --> 03:27.200
And yet, you still haven't
signed your number one player

03:27.267 --> 03:29.333
with all that money
sitting on the table.

03:29.400 --> 03:32.467
You're not putting
a "For Sale" sign on my team.

03:32.533 --> 03:34.600
You're not giving
the league a reason not to.

04:02.933 --> 04:05.433
Hey.
Someone's in beast mode.

04:05.500 --> 04:08.100
I got a call from the director
of Boston's dance squad.

04:08.167 --> 04:10.267
She liked the routine
I choreographed last season.

04:10.333 --> 04:11.667
She asked me to
upload some steps,

04:11.733 --> 04:13.900
see if there's something
maybe her dancers could try.

04:13.967 --> 04:16.833
Could be my first paying gig
post-Devil Girls.

04:16.900 --> 04:19.933
Ahsha, that's--
that's amazing.

04:21.067 --> 04:23.167
Couldn't have come
at a better time.

04:24.367 --> 04:25.900
Today is the Devil Girls
calendar shoot.

04:25.967 --> 04:27.200
I'm fine.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.967
I could just really use
the money, that's all.

04:36.133 --> 04:38.800
Places, places.
Come on.

04:38.867 --> 04:40.667
My first calendar
in two years.

04:40.733 --> 04:42.967
I don't think
you're ready.

04:45.533 --> 04:47.133
Now you're ready.

04:47.200 --> 04:49.267
Come on.

06:48.100 --> 06:51.533
A Las Vegas per diem?

06:51.600 --> 06:53.367
Nevada doesn't even
have a team.

06:53.433 --> 06:54.567
You're literally
asking

06:54.633 --> 06:55.400
for gambling money.

06:55.467 --> 06:56.600
From a junior agent for us

06:56.667 --> 06:59.200
to a power player
for the Devils.

06:59.267 --> 07:00.533
Wasn't it just a year ago

07:00.600 --> 07:02.300
he was screwing up
our coffee orders?

07:02.367 --> 07:04.567
We're wasting time.

07:04.633 --> 07:07.067
I need Derek's deal
hammered out

07:07.100 --> 07:08.633
by midnight tomorrow.

07:08.700 --> 07:12.467
Well, then,
let's get to hammering.

07:15.733 --> 07:18.067
Jude, a minute?

07:18.133 --> 07:20.100
Yeah.
Excuse us.

07:23.567 --> 07:26.067
Lucas is flirting
with you.

07:26.133 --> 07:28.067
What?
I don't think so.

07:28.100 --> 07:29.700
I don't have time
to stand here

07:29.767 --> 07:31.567
and talk you through
your feelings about this.

07:31.633 --> 07:33.700
He wants you.
I want Derek.

07:33.767 --> 07:35.967
What are you saying?

07:36.067 --> 07:37.700
I'm saying
get back in there,

07:37.767 --> 07:41.167
hike up your skirt and give
that guy what he wants.

07:41.233 --> 07:42.467
Buy him drinks.

07:42.533 --> 07:44.067
You charm him,
you take it from there.

07:44.133 --> 07:45.600
I don't charm people, okay?

07:45.667 --> 07:47.900
I'm not a charmer.
This is ridiculous.

07:47.967 --> 07:50.367
This Derek Roman's deal.

07:50.433 --> 07:51.933
Now, you put on
your big girl panties

07:52.067 --> 07:53.300
and you figure it out.

08:02.367 --> 08:05.533
The league was just in here
asking about the Kinkades.

08:05.600 --> 08:07.367
They're gonna
force a sale.

08:07.433 --> 08:09.833
It's a Christmas miracle.

08:09.900 --> 08:13.967
You did this?

08:14.067 --> 08:15.867
You sicced the league
on them.

08:15.933 --> 08:18.800
Only because I didn't have
a pack of wild dogs.

08:18.867 --> 08:21.567
What if Oscar
finds out?

08:21.633 --> 08:23.267
You shouldn't be sticking
your neck out like this.

08:23.333 --> 08:24.467
My neck is already
out there.

08:24.533 --> 08:26.233
I'm the lead witness
for the prosecution

08:26.300 --> 08:28.300
in his murder trial,
and I won't let Oscar

08:28.367 --> 08:30.533
stop me from doing
what has to be done.

08:30.600 --> 08:34.533
Oscar is
in jail for murder.

08:34.600 --> 08:36.467
I just want you
to be safe.

08:36.533 --> 08:39.267
And I love you for it.

08:46.233 --> 08:48.133
Yes.
Okay, thank you.

08:50.067 --> 08:52.400
Um...

08:52.467 --> 08:55.900
Okay.
Sure, thank you.

08:55.967 --> 08:58.933
That was the director
of Boston's dance squad.

08:59.067 --> 09:00.400
They didn't like
the choreography?

09:00.467 --> 09:02.900
No, they didn't like it.

09:02.967 --> 09:03.900
They loved it.

09:03.967 --> 09:07.167
Oh, that's great!

09:07.233 --> 09:09.800
So... you're gonna
get to do more?

09:09.867 --> 09:12.267
They asked me
to join the team.

09:12.333 --> 09:15.200
Like... move to Boston?

09:15.267 --> 09:17.967
What do I do?

09:22.700 --> 09:25.233
Well, damn.

09:25.300 --> 09:27.533
Right back at you.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.100
How many meetings
did you set up for today?

09:30.167 --> 09:31.100
Six.

09:31.167 --> 09:32.567
Good.
Mmm.

09:32.633 --> 09:34.533
Some day we'll have a couple
billion under the mattress,

09:34.600 --> 09:36.067
but until then,
we need a partner

09:36.133 --> 09:37.667
to help us buy the team.

09:37.733 --> 09:38.700
Mmm.

09:38.767 --> 09:40.900
What?

09:40.967 --> 09:42.533
I lost my shoe deal.

09:42.600 --> 09:44.967
You're the face
of the brand.

09:45.067 --> 09:46.800
Yeah, the brand wants a face
that's not looking on

09:46.867 --> 09:48.567
from the bench
half the season, maybe more.

09:48.633 --> 09:49.867
Oh, God.

09:49.933 --> 09:52.067
It's a $10 million
endorsement out the window,

09:52.067 --> 09:55.867
all because of my...
stupidity.

09:55.933 --> 09:58.300
I should postpone
these meetings.

09:58.367 --> 10:00.467
You don't postpone.

10:00.533 --> 10:03.433
You are Terrence Wall.

10:03.500 --> 10:05.233
You get in there
and win.

10:05.300 --> 10:07.600
And don't say
you lost anything.

10:07.667 --> 10:09.367
Meanwhile, there is
something I can do

10:09.433 --> 10:10.867
to beef up our profile.

10:10.933 --> 10:13.000
What?

10:13.067 --> 10:17.467
Someone has something
valuable of mine.

10:17.533 --> 10:20.800
It's time I got it back.

10:24.033 --> 10:25.567
I knew you'd call me

10:25.633 --> 10:28.833
for that 10%
of the Devil Girls.

10:28.900 --> 10:32.867
I'd hoped it wouldn't
take half a year.

10:32.933 --> 10:36.733
I guess it wasn't as valuable
to me as you thought.

10:36.800 --> 10:41.533
Or it's valuable enough
that you need it now.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.567
Why?

10:43.633 --> 10:46.933
Terrence and I have
the inside track

10:47.000 --> 10:48.833
on buying the Devils.

10:48.900 --> 10:50.533
We need all the assets
we can get.

10:54.733 --> 10:56.967
You don't believe
we could own the team?

10:58.633 --> 11:02.600
I don't believe
what's on your finger.

11:02.667 --> 11:04.900
Is it what I think it is?

11:04.967 --> 11:06.133
We're engaged.

11:06.200 --> 11:09.667
Jelena, that's wonderful.

11:09.733 --> 11:11.067
Yes.

11:11.067 --> 11:12.967
So, getting back
to the important thing.

11:13.067 --> 11:15.333
This is the important thing.

11:15.400 --> 11:16.500
You weren't
gonna tell me?

11:16.567 --> 11:17.767
We haven't
announced it yet.

11:17.833 --> 11:20.600
I'm your mother,
I don't need it announced.

11:20.667 --> 11:22.100
I need to be
part of it.

11:22.167 --> 11:25.800
That's not going to happen.

11:29.833 --> 11:35.067
You like deals.
I got one for you.

11:35.133 --> 11:37.700
We can talk about the 10%

11:37.767 --> 11:41.567
while we plan one thing
for the wedding tomorrow.

11:41.633 --> 11:45.200
And I get to choose
what it is.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.867
It's double overtime,
we're down by six,

11:51.933 --> 11:53.067
Indiana's got the ball.

11:53.100 --> 11:54.767
The only way to turn it
around is to get--

11:54.833 --> 11:56.100
Terrence.

11:56.167 --> 11:58.100
You want me to invest
a lot of money in you,

11:58.167 --> 12:00.500
not buy you a beer.

12:00.567 --> 12:01.767
It's gonna take a lot more

12:01.833 --> 12:03.333
than the stories
of your glory days

12:03.400 --> 12:04.933
to get to my ATM pin.

12:05.067 --> 12:06.500
Of course.

12:06.567 --> 12:07.933
This is business.

12:08.067 --> 12:13.367
Speaking of business,
your finances are solid.

12:13.433 --> 12:16.367
Juicy contracts,
healthy endorsements.

12:16.433 --> 12:17.567
How's your shoe deal
looking?

12:17.633 --> 12:20.067
Great.
Three years strong.

12:20.100 --> 12:21.567
Strike two.

12:21.633 --> 12:23.867
I know you lost that.

12:23.933 --> 12:26.333
I know because
it went to a player

12:26.400 --> 12:28.967
on a soccer team I own.

12:29.067 --> 12:31.167
You're sinking here.

12:31.233 --> 12:32.867
You smell it, right?

12:34.667 --> 12:37.767
I'm trying to score here.

12:37.833 --> 12:39.267
You're right,
I lost the deal.

12:39.333 --> 12:42.067
But Jelena is already out there
trying to replace it.

12:42.100 --> 12:44.533
And that's what you get
working with us.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.967
We are tenacious as hell.

12:47.067 --> 12:50.500
And we know what it means
to be partners.

12:50.567 --> 12:52.633
Make sure she succeeds.

12:52.700 --> 12:54.500
The league needs to see you

12:54.567 --> 12:56.767
as more than just
a player and a dancer.

12:56.833 --> 12:59.533
They need to see you as
players at the table.

13:04.633 --> 13:07.200
Come back to me when
you can fully buy in.

13:13.233 --> 13:14.333
Okay, Teddy.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.267
"50 Shades of Kyle".

13:16.333 --> 13:17.567
Who, what,
where, when and how?

13:17.633 --> 13:19.700
You forgot "why".

13:19.767 --> 13:22.467
It's a movie about my life.

13:22.533 --> 13:24.167
I know why.

13:24.233 --> 13:25.733
Hmm.

13:25.800 --> 13:28.200
How much you sinking
into this thing?

13:28.267 --> 13:30.567
Not a dime.

13:30.633 --> 13:32.133
So who's footing the bill?

13:32.200 --> 13:34.533
Free and Clear Productions.

13:34.600 --> 13:36.267
They heard I had the rights
to your life story,

13:36.333 --> 13:38.733
I said they could have them

13:38.800 --> 13:39.967
if they gave me a job
on the film.

13:40.067 --> 13:43.967
You paid me 150k
for those rights.

13:44.067 --> 13:45.367
What kind of job's
worth that?

13:45.433 --> 13:47.500
Director.

13:47.567 --> 13:50.133
You're the director?

13:50.200 --> 13:51.267
Of my life story.

13:51.333 --> 13:53.533
Kickass, right?

14:00.333 --> 14:02.533
I like this photo.

14:02.600 --> 14:05.067
You like it
because she's smiling.

14:05.133 --> 14:07.233
Sex sells.

14:07.300 --> 14:10.467
I like it because her ass
looks great in that light.

14:10.533 --> 14:14.300
I'll put it
in the "yes" pile.

14:15.633 --> 14:16.733
Ladies.

14:16.800 --> 14:18.233
I'll need to approve
the calendar

14:18.300 --> 14:20.367
and the final cut of the dance
before they go wide.

14:20.433 --> 14:23.767
Oscar had
more important things
to worry about.

14:23.833 --> 14:26.900
Oscar isn't dealing with what
I'm dealing with right now.

14:26.967 --> 14:31.400
I can't afford anything negative
blowing back on me.

14:31.467 --> 14:32.933
Good talk.

14:44.967 --> 14:48.133
And Derek's gonna need his own
private chef for away games.

14:48.200 --> 14:50.100
Not a problem.

14:50.167 --> 14:52.733
You know,
I wish we could have...

14:52.800 --> 14:54.433
had a private chef right now.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.300
So we could have
dinner together privately.

14:56.367 --> 14:58.267
I mean, in private.

15:00.633 --> 15:02.367
Are you coming on to me?

15:05.767 --> 15:08.867
Li... Lionel said you were
flirting with me.

15:08.933 --> 15:11.100
I... I told her you weren't.

15:11.167 --> 15:12.933
And she sent you here
to seduce me

15:13.067 --> 15:14.567
to get a better deal
for Derek?

15:18.467 --> 15:19.567
Look, I...

15:19.633 --> 15:22.100
Go, Lionel.

15:22.167 --> 15:23.767
Go?

15:23.833 --> 15:26.100
Well, I mean, I always had
my eye on you at the office.

15:26.167 --> 15:27.833
I just...

15:27.900 --> 15:29.367
never knew you were gay.

15:31.567 --> 15:33.233
This is kind of a new thing.

15:33.300 --> 15:34.233
For me anyway.

15:34.300 --> 15:36.267
Lucky me, huh?

15:37.800 --> 15:40.167
Look... I'll run
this deal by Derek,

15:40.233 --> 15:42.167
but I'm gonna need
two more things.

15:42.233 --> 15:43.767
Name 'em.

15:43.833 --> 15:45.200
I want you to add
another point

15:45.267 --> 15:46.767
to Derek's signing bonus

15:46.833 --> 15:49.100
and I wanna take you
on a date.

15:53.133 --> 15:54.600
Where have you been?

15:54.667 --> 15:56.067
Uh, working on Derek's deal.

15:56.067 --> 15:57.467
Exactly.

15:57.533 --> 15:58.633
You're my agent too.

15:58.700 --> 16:00.067
Trojan's blowing up
my phone.

16:00.100 --> 16:02.967
Someone needs
to call them back.

16:04.667 --> 16:06.567
I'll run the terms
by Derek but...

16:06.633 --> 16:07.933
I think we can close this.

16:10.633 --> 16:11.867
Bye.

16:19.467 --> 16:20.933
What?

16:21.067 --> 16:24.433
We both know what you just did
and why you did it.

16:26.500 --> 16:27.933
You won't be with me
the way I want

16:28.067 --> 16:29.900
but you don't
want me with anyone else.

16:31.633 --> 16:33.400
I feel bad.

16:33.467 --> 16:34.867
I got that.

16:44.700 --> 16:46.067
Smooth, smooth.

16:46.067 --> 16:47.467
Looks good.

16:47.533 --> 16:48.800
Nice shot.

16:48.867 --> 16:51.933
You wanna talk
about me signing my deal.

16:52.067 --> 16:53.633
I don't care what Lionel wants.

16:53.700 --> 16:55.200
I care about what you want.

16:55.267 --> 16:57.300
Because what I want is
you out here starting for me

16:57.367 --> 16:58.367
first game of the season.

16:58.433 --> 17:01.067
I want an empire.

17:01.133 --> 17:04.067
Oh, yeah?

17:04.133 --> 17:06.733
What's an empire go for
these days?

17:07.733 --> 17:09.767
I'll know it when I hear it.

17:09.833 --> 17:12.933
I know ego when I hear it.

17:13.067 --> 17:18.200
Look... Derek, you're worth
whatever you can get.

17:18.267 --> 17:20.067
I just don't want it to
cost you what you really want,

17:20.133 --> 17:22.567
and that's to be out here
on this court.

17:22.633 --> 17:25.067
If you drag this out, I don't
want you to push it so far

17:25.133 --> 17:27.133
that it ends up
blowing up in your face.

17:28.767 --> 17:31.600
I got this, Coach.

17:31.667 --> 17:33.933
I hope so.

17:35.500 --> 17:38.233
At a certain point...

17:38.300 --> 17:41.333
something will become more
important than your ego.

17:54.667 --> 17:55.933
Nice uniform.

17:56.067 --> 17:57.900
Boston made me an offer.

17:57.967 --> 17:59.800
I didn't know
how to tell you

17:59.867 --> 18:01.933
or if it was worth
bringing up or...

18:02.067 --> 18:04.067
Ahsha, of course
you should tell me.

18:04.067 --> 18:05.400
It's wonderful news.

18:05.467 --> 18:06.733
They'd be lucky to have you.

18:06.800 --> 18:09.533
You know, they are
3,000 miles away.

18:09.600 --> 18:12.233
You barely handled me
going off to dance camp
for a week.

18:12.300 --> 18:13.967
You were nine.

18:14.067 --> 18:16.333
Would you be okay if I left?

18:16.400 --> 18:21.433
No. Only because I'd miss you
something awful.

18:21.500 --> 18:24.100
But I would never
stop you from doing something

18:24.167 --> 18:27.800
you thought would
make you happy.

18:27.867 --> 18:30.633
Not again.

18:30.700 --> 18:33.633
Would this make you happy?

18:33.700 --> 18:35.367
I don't know.

18:35.433 --> 18:39.333
Some parts yes,
other parts...

18:40.900 --> 18:44.333
German and I started talking
about it this morning.

18:44.400 --> 18:46.533
I called him
to talk about it more

18:46.600 --> 18:50.233
but he's not
answering his phone.

19:12.933 --> 19:14.233
Hey, Coach, got a sec?

19:14.300 --> 19:15.600
Wanna talk about captain.

19:15.667 --> 19:17.100
Take a seat.

19:20.500 --> 19:21.767
I want it.

19:21.833 --> 19:23.100
Nothing more to say.

19:23.167 --> 19:25.567
You've been a Devil
for half a season, Zero.

19:25.633 --> 19:28.200
Captain usually goes to somebody
with more seniority.

19:28.267 --> 19:31.367
Fair... but I'm
no stranger to this team.

19:31.433 --> 19:33.400
I've been following
the Devils since I was a kid.

19:33.467 --> 19:34.933
I thought you were
from Colorado.

19:35.067 --> 19:36.300
Well, Denver was my team

19:36.367 --> 19:38.267
till L.A.
came through in '96.

19:38.333 --> 19:39.767
Aha-- that was a big game
for me.

19:39.833 --> 19:41.167
I know.

19:41.233 --> 19:43.733
Chase Vincent got injured,
you stepped up,

19:43.800 --> 19:46.233
singlehandedly clinched
the division title.

19:47.500 --> 19:48.533
After the game
you signed autographs

19:48.600 --> 19:50.367
for a bunch of kids...

19:50.433 --> 19:54.067
and one of 'em...
was me.

19:54.133 --> 19:55.300
Now here I am,

19:55.367 --> 19:57.167
I'm playing for the Devils

19:57.233 --> 19:59.867
and I feel like this is
my chance to step up.

20:00.067 --> 20:02.267
That is unbelievable.

20:02.333 --> 20:03.500
I know.

20:03.567 --> 20:07.300
No, I mean I don't believe
a word of it.

20:07.367 --> 20:10.600
I'm not gonna get
suckered in by some crap story.

20:13.167 --> 20:18.433
But... the season
starts tomorrow...

20:18.500 --> 20:21.700
and the truth is...

20:21.767 --> 20:26.133
without Terrence
and without Derek...

20:26.200 --> 20:27.600
I do need a captain.

20:27.667 --> 20:29.000
Another truth?

20:29.067 --> 20:32.200
You got two rings...

20:32.267 --> 20:34.400
you're smart as hell
and you know how to win.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.000
So...?

20:36.067 --> 20:37.633
The job is yours.

20:40.567 --> 20:43.533
What idiot would trust
this idiot to make a movie?

20:43.600 --> 20:46.167
Teddy Reynolds can't even direct
his car down a driveway

20:46.233 --> 20:48.100
without taking
half his house with him.

20:48.167 --> 20:51.933
I told him to get me everything
he has on this producer.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Mm-hmm... mmm.

20:54.067 --> 20:57.300
Get me another beer,
would you, wifey?

20:59.033 --> 21:01.067
Please...?

21:01.933 --> 21:03.733
Look at me

21:03.800 --> 21:05.267
hanging out
with two superstars.

21:05.333 --> 21:07.400
How does it feel
being back?

21:07.467 --> 21:10.133
I forgot how much
I missed the girls...

21:10.200 --> 21:12.067
or how hard these dances are.

21:12.100 --> 21:13.533
With the excitement
and the rehearsals,

21:13.600 --> 21:15.833
my heart is literally
beating out of my chest.

21:15.900 --> 21:17.500
When I went
to the Devil Girl physical,

21:17.567 --> 21:20.767
the doctor had to give me Valium
to get me to relax.
Ooh.

21:20.833 --> 21:22.600
It's crazy.

21:22.667 --> 21:24.433
We swapped places again.

21:24.500 --> 21:27.200
This time you're in
and I'm out.

21:27.267 --> 21:31.767
Ahsha, your next big thing is
just around the corner.

21:31.833 --> 21:34.467
Or across the country.

21:35.633 --> 21:37.700
Boston wants me
to dance for them.

21:37.767 --> 21:40.467
Boston? As in,
in Boston?

21:40.533 --> 21:41.600
Boston.

21:41.667 --> 21:43.133
What about Derek?

21:43.200 --> 21:45.567
That's a weird
first question.

21:45.633 --> 21:47.067
Why would I be
thinking about Derek?

21:47.133 --> 21:48.633
I don't know.

21:48.700 --> 21:51.600
When I think long-term,
I think of you and Derek.

21:51.667 --> 21:52.700
Ahsha's back with German.

21:52.767 --> 21:54.133
He's always been there
for her.

21:54.200 --> 21:55.600
He's long-term.

21:55.667 --> 21:57.067
Oh...

21:57.067 --> 21:59.067
I guess I'm Team Derek.

21:59.133 --> 22:00.400
I guess I'm Team German.

22:00.467 --> 22:02.067
Okay, well,
I'm Team Ahsha,

22:02.133 --> 22:05.167
and right now Team Ahsha
doesn't know what to do.

22:09.400 --> 22:11.633
I'm glad we're away
from the arena.

22:11.700 --> 22:12.833
No more interruptions.

22:12.900 --> 22:14.800
You've repped Zero.

22:14.867 --> 22:17.233
You know what he's like.

22:17.300 --> 22:19.100
Big night tonight.

22:19.167 --> 22:20.933
After Derek signs...

22:21.067 --> 22:22.067
why don't we celebrate?

22:22.100 --> 22:23.267
Drinks at The Abbey?

22:23.333 --> 22:26.967
Wow. Two public places
in one day.

22:27.067 --> 22:28.833
You're not
a swamp creature, Jude.

22:28.900 --> 22:30.233
No. No, I know.

22:30.300 --> 22:33.400
I'm just...
not used to it.

22:33.467 --> 22:34.767
I've never been
to that bar.

22:34.833 --> 22:37.367
I always wanted to go
with my ex but...

22:37.433 --> 22:39.067
Well, he's not really my ex.

22:39.100 --> 22:40.300
We were never
really together.

22:40.367 --> 22:42.867
No... I mean,
we were together.

22:42.933 --> 22:44.167
Was he your first?

22:44.233 --> 22:46.467
First and only.

22:46.533 --> 22:49.900
Oh, and you've never been
with anyone else but him?

22:49.967 --> 22:51.600
No.

22:51.667 --> 22:53.167
And how long has it been

22:53.233 --> 22:54.700
since you guys
stopped talking?

22:54.767 --> 22:57.267
Four months.

22:57.333 --> 23:01.433
And in all that time, you've
never been with... anyone else?

23:01.500 --> 23:02.833
No. No.

23:02.900 --> 23:05.200
This guy, he was...

23:05.267 --> 23:06.567
everything to me.

23:06.633 --> 23:08.267
I mean,
I was in love with him

23:08.333 --> 23:10.500
before I even knew
what love was.

23:10.567 --> 23:12.867
When something
blinds you like that...

23:12.933 --> 23:15.633
it takes a while for
your eyes to adjust again.

23:15.700 --> 23:18.467
Till you can see
anything else, you know?

23:18.533 --> 23:20.533
Oh, that's Zero.

23:20.600 --> 23:21.733
I gotta cut out.

23:21.800 --> 23:23.333
Don't let Zero
sabotage another date.

23:23.400 --> 23:27.700
Zero didn't
sabotage anything, Jude.

23:27.767 --> 23:29.400
You did.

23:29.467 --> 23:32.467
I mean, you're still clearly
hung up on this other guy,

23:32.533 --> 23:33.667
whoever he is.

23:38.200 --> 23:40.467
Hey, Zero.

23:52.067 --> 23:53.367
I'm here to work
on the dance cut.

23:53.433 --> 23:55.933
Is Ed over there?

23:56.067 --> 23:58.467
Great. I'll be up in a minute.

24:04.300 --> 24:06.767
Thank you so much.
See you.

24:12.867 --> 24:15.633
Who are you and why are you
following me?

24:15.700 --> 24:20.967
My name is Eddie and
I'm, uh... your bodyguard.

24:21.067 --> 24:23.133
My what?

24:23.200 --> 24:25.067
Coach Davenport hired me
to keep an eye on you.

24:25.067 --> 24:28.767
Pete never said anything
about getting me a bodyguard.

24:28.833 --> 24:30.267
I think he thought
it would scare you.

24:30.333 --> 24:32.933
Well, I'm glad we avoided that.

24:33.067 --> 24:34.267
Yeah.

24:34.333 --> 24:36.067
I think you've done enough.
You can go home.

24:36.133 --> 24:37.633
I'll make sure
Pete pays you for the week.

24:37.700 --> 24:42.233
Oh... okay, and again,
I'm sorry if I...

24:42.300 --> 24:44.333
I scared you.

24:50.067 --> 24:52.267
Oh... you're late.

24:52.333 --> 24:55.400
I'm here now.

24:58.867 --> 25:01.567
So let's talk about the 10%.

25:01.633 --> 25:04.333
We have all evening
to talk about that.

25:04.400 --> 25:09.133
Jelena, I reserved
the boutique until close.

25:09.200 --> 25:10.400
When your father and I
got married,

25:10.467 --> 25:13.067
we couldn't--
No.

25:13.100 --> 25:16.233
I agreed to meet you here,
I'll even stay and do this,

25:16.300 --> 25:17.900
but I will not
under any circumstance

25:17.967 --> 25:19.567
talk about James Howard.

25:30.533 --> 25:32.100
Ahsha. Hey.

25:38.233 --> 25:40.167
Random, meeting you here.

25:40.233 --> 25:41.733
Oh, not so random.

25:41.800 --> 25:44.233
We used to run this park
together around this time.

25:44.300 --> 25:45.933
Old habits, I guess.

25:46.067 --> 25:47.800
Hard to break.

25:51.333 --> 25:52.633
So, how are you?

25:52.700 --> 25:54.333
Super busy.

25:54.400 --> 25:56.967
Getting some good responses
on my choreography.

25:57.067 --> 25:59.100
That's great, Ahsha.

25:59.167 --> 26:00.567
How about you?

26:00.633 --> 26:01.967
They're saying on the news

26:02.067 --> 26:04.067
that you still haven't
signed a new contract.

26:04.133 --> 26:06.400
Yeah, well, thanks to
the last six months,

26:06.467 --> 26:07.767
I know my worth now.

26:07.833 --> 26:10.167
I need to be aware of
everyone else's too.

26:10.233 --> 26:13.200
That make sense?

26:13.267 --> 26:14.767
Yeah, it does.

26:14.833 --> 26:18.567
Your pops thinks I'm
pushing the limit, but...

26:18.633 --> 26:21.433
I just want
everything on the table.

26:21.500 --> 26:24.067
Can't have any more
regrets in my life.

26:27.467 --> 26:29.233
Have a good run, Ahsha.

26:46.633 --> 26:48.500
Kyle! When did you get here?

26:48.567 --> 26:50.200
20 minutes ago.

26:50.267 --> 26:52.300
How did you
get past security?

26:52.367 --> 26:54.533
That's cute.

26:54.600 --> 26:56.233
What are these?

26:56.300 --> 26:59.333
My storyboards
for the movie.

26:59.400 --> 27:02.100
Yeah, it's a bunch
of stick figures doing it.

27:02.167 --> 27:04.767
Not all the same way.

27:04.833 --> 27:08.167
Where is the paperwork on the
production company I asked for?

27:08.233 --> 27:11.167
Here you go.

27:11.233 --> 27:12.967
Everything's
paperless now, Kyle.

27:13.067 --> 27:15.233
Franklin cannot wait
to get started.

27:15.300 --> 27:17.933
Franklin's the name
of the producer.
Uh-huh.

27:18.067 --> 27:19.333
Well, what's he like?

27:19.400 --> 27:21.400
Super smart...
from what I've read.

27:21.467 --> 27:23.300
You've never met him?

27:23.367 --> 27:24.833
He's out of Phoenix.

27:24.900 --> 27:28.133
Okay, let me get this straight.

27:28.200 --> 27:31.100
You made a deal to make a movie
for a producer you've never met

27:31.167 --> 27:33.500
based in the other
movie capital of the world...

27:33.567 --> 27:34.633
Phoenix, Arizona.

27:34.700 --> 27:35.967
Crazy, right?

27:36.067 --> 27:37.433
If it wasn't for
the $5 million budget,

27:37.500 --> 27:39.133
I wouldn't have
believed it either.

27:39.200 --> 27:42.200
$5 million?

27:42.267 --> 27:43.633
Mm-hmm.

27:43.700 --> 27:45.500
Hmm.

27:51.500 --> 27:53.233
Arson is still illegal...

27:53.300 --> 27:54.833
right?

27:54.900 --> 27:56.633
Well, that saves me from asking
my first question.

27:56.700 --> 27:59.833
I'm in wedding dress hell.

27:59.900 --> 28:03.933
Nothing cheap champagne and
a frontal lobotomy can't fix.

28:04.067 --> 28:06.433
I have something that'll
cheer you up.

28:06.500 --> 28:08.400
Jackson Everett
just checked in with me.

28:08.467 --> 28:11.067
He wouldn't do that if he wasn't
serious about partnering up.

28:11.067 --> 28:12.500
No, he wouldn't.

28:14.400 --> 28:16.133
I need to get this 10%.

28:16.200 --> 28:17.600
I know how hard this is.

28:17.667 --> 28:19.067
With Vanessa--

28:19.067 --> 28:20.900
I'm not spending one more day
in that arena

28:20.967 --> 28:22.400
wondering
what's going to happen to you.

28:22.467 --> 28:24.467
To us.

28:24.533 --> 28:27.067
We are buying the Devils.

28:29.800 --> 28:32.300
If this is what I have to do...

28:32.367 --> 28:34.533
I love you.

28:34.600 --> 28:37.867
You better.

28:42.133 --> 28:44.133
Bang-up job
on the contract, Jude.

28:44.200 --> 28:46.133
Hey, did you get
banged in the process?

28:46.200 --> 28:47.467
Or are you the banger?

28:47.533 --> 28:49.067
We've actually never
talked about that.

28:49.067 --> 28:52.200
I just got off the phone
with Derek's lawyer.

28:52.267 --> 28:54.633
He said we might not want to
wait around until midnight.

28:54.700 --> 28:57.533
Derek's not coming?

28:57.600 --> 29:00.067
He didn't take the deal.

29:03.600 --> 29:04.867
Jelena!

29:04.933 --> 29:06.900
You have been in there forever.

29:06.967 --> 29:10.167
Do I have to get
the Jaws of Life?

29:19.267 --> 29:22.933
My goodness...

29:23.067 --> 29:26.200
You are...

29:26.267 --> 29:28.200
stunning.

29:28.267 --> 29:31.867
Oh...

29:31.933 --> 29:34.967
This...
is a statement dress.

29:35.067 --> 29:38.767
The beading...
the trim...

29:38.833 --> 29:40.100
When those doors open

29:40.167 --> 29:42.500
and you step out on that
aisle with your father--

29:42.567 --> 29:45.233
That's never going to happen.

29:45.300 --> 29:46.533
Oh, Jelena...

29:46.600 --> 29:48.867
The only statement
being made by this dress

29:48.933 --> 29:50.767
is that this entire day
is a joke.

29:50.833 --> 29:53.867
You forcing me
to try on dresses,

29:53.933 --> 29:56.267
you pretending that you have
any right to be here,

29:56.333 --> 29:59.567
be a part of my wedding,
be a part of my life at all.

29:59.633 --> 30:02.800
I gave you your life, and like
it or not, I am your mother.

30:02.867 --> 30:04.600
You throw that word around
like it means something.

30:04.667 --> 30:05.933
Well, it means
something to me.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.133
And that's
the biggest joke of all.

30:10.367 --> 30:11.933
You can push me away
all you want

30:12.000 --> 30:13.267
but I've taken bigger hits

30:13.333 --> 30:15.200
than anything
you could throw at me.

30:15.267 --> 30:17.267
You say that with pride.

30:17.333 --> 30:18.733
Oh, you're damn right I do,

30:18.800 --> 30:20.500
because that's
what this mother did

30:20.567 --> 30:22.233
to protect her child.

30:22.300 --> 30:23.233
Protect me?
Yes.

30:23.300 --> 30:25.700
Protect me from what?

30:25.767 --> 30:27.467
From seeing my own mother
getting...
Please...

30:27.533 --> 30:29.100
punched in the face?

30:29.167 --> 30:32.500
From hearing her body
hit the floor?

30:32.567 --> 30:34.233
I was scared as hell.

30:34.300 --> 30:37.700
Who was I supposed to go to
to make it better?

30:37.767 --> 30:40.167
To feel safe?

30:40.233 --> 30:43.600
A woman lying to the police
each time they came to the door.

30:43.667 --> 30:45.800
A mother wouldn't have
let her daughter

30:45.867 --> 30:47.500
live in a house
with a violent man,

30:47.567 --> 30:49.433
no matter how much
she loved him.

30:49.500 --> 30:51.633
A mother would have left!

30:59.800 --> 31:04.133
All this time...

31:04.200 --> 31:07.367
I felt bad 'cause
you didn't have a father.

31:11.700 --> 31:15.400
Now I see.

31:15.467 --> 31:17.900
You didn't have
a mother either.

31:24.767 --> 31:28.067
My biggest fear...

31:28.133 --> 31:31.367
is that you'll walk
out of my life forever.

31:34.333 --> 31:36.600
And now the only thing
I can do for you

31:36.667 --> 31:38.700
is to risk just that.

32:08.633 --> 32:10.233
It's all yours.

32:17.667 --> 32:21.333
And I'll never force you
to call me again.

32:21.400 --> 32:26.900
If I'm ever gonna be
the mother you need...

32:26.967 --> 32:32.067
you need to wanna call me.

32:32.067 --> 32:37.667
And if you ever do,
just know, my...

32:37.733 --> 32:41.933
my girl...

32:42.067 --> 32:44.467
that I will answer.

32:58.567 --> 33:00.800
Does he still do it?

33:07.200 --> 33:09.067
No.

33:23.533 --> 33:25.067
Where have you been?

33:25.067 --> 33:27.400
Sorry, I got caught up
in something. What's up?

33:27.467 --> 33:32.267
Thought you might be avoiding me
over this Boston thing.

33:32.333 --> 33:34.400
And if you are...

33:34.467 --> 33:39.067
I'm kind of afraid what I have
to tell you might make it worse.

33:39.067 --> 33:42.533
I know my worth and...

33:42.600 --> 33:43.800
I know I wanna be somewhere

33:43.867 --> 33:46.700
where the people
around me know it too.

33:46.767 --> 33:48.400
I wanna go to Boston.

33:51.900 --> 33:53.200
I wanna come with you.

33:53.267 --> 33:56.067
You wanna go to Boston?
Look, Ahsha...

33:56.133 --> 34:00.933
I been doing
a lot of thinking.

34:01.067 --> 34:03.700
I think a change
would be good...

34:03.767 --> 34:05.433
for both of us.

34:05.500 --> 34:08.400
German, are you serious?

34:08.467 --> 34:10.933
100%.

34:12.900 --> 34:14.433
We're goin' to Boston!

34:30.367 --> 34:31.867
Well?

34:37.200 --> 34:39.633
You did it.

34:39.700 --> 34:45.100
Jackson is in and we have a
partner to help us buy the team.

34:52.067 --> 34:55.400
This is happening, J.

34:55.467 --> 34:56.933
We just can't tell anyone.

34:57.067 --> 34:59.067
Jackson said the longer
we stay under the radar,

34:59.067 --> 35:02.533
the better our chances.

35:05.067 --> 35:09.267
Keeping this to ourselves...

35:09.333 --> 35:11.767
It's you and me
against the world.

35:13.733 --> 35:16.533
It's always you and me.

35:34.400 --> 35:36.133
Little late
for a house call.

35:36.200 --> 35:37.500
Hopefully not for a beating.

35:38.900 --> 35:40.067
You really wanna
ride the bench

35:40.100 --> 35:41.100
for the first game
of the season?

35:41.167 --> 35:43.067
Willing to take
a short-term hit

35:43.133 --> 35:44.267
to reach a long-term goal.

35:44.333 --> 35:45.433
Long term?

35:45.500 --> 35:46.900
I already offered you
enough money

35:46.967 --> 35:48.133
to buy a small country.

35:48.200 --> 35:49.567
That's more money
than one person

35:49.633 --> 35:51.067
could possibly ever need.

35:58.167 --> 36:01.333
This isn't just
about you, is it?

36:05.200 --> 36:08.633
All this... for Ahsha?

36:08.700 --> 36:11.400
What, so you can
lay more at her feet?

36:11.467 --> 36:13.267
You're a bigger fool
than I thought.

36:13.333 --> 36:14.267
You're holding out
for something

36:14.333 --> 36:17.067
that will never happen.

36:18.500 --> 36:20.467
You haven't heard.

36:20.533 --> 36:23.633
German gave his notice
to H.R.

36:23.700 --> 36:25.900
He's moving to Boston...

36:25.967 --> 36:27.433
with Ahsha.

36:36.433 --> 36:38.100
Lionel's with Derek
right now.

36:38.167 --> 36:39.600
I'm sure he's signing
as we speak.

36:39.667 --> 36:42.967
Forcing a sale is not
an empty threat, Jude.

36:43.067 --> 36:46.333
We already have another
potential buyer for the Devils
lined up.

36:49.967 --> 36:53.067
League's forcing a sale?

36:53.067 --> 36:54.700
They think they are.

36:54.767 --> 36:57.800
Kinkades have owned
the Devils for over 25 years.

36:57.867 --> 37:00.767
I mean, who would have the balls
to try to steal it away?

37:00.833 --> 37:03.067
Why do you care?

37:03.133 --> 37:06.067
I am team captain now.

37:06.100 --> 37:08.267
I should know.

37:08.333 --> 37:11.133
Captain?

37:11.200 --> 37:13.333
Does the power turn you on?

37:14.767 --> 37:17.133
I'm gonna swing by Jelena's
restaurant to celebrate.

37:17.200 --> 37:20.767
Maybe Terrence'll be there
and I can rub it in his face.

37:20.833 --> 37:21.933
You wanna come?

37:22.067 --> 37:23.200
No.

37:23.267 --> 37:24.667
Hot date with Lucas?

37:34.067 --> 37:36.067
Ugh.

37:36.067 --> 37:37.100
It's amateur hour.

37:37.167 --> 37:38.300
Stick figures, emails,

37:38.367 --> 37:40.400
a dude in Phoenix
with $5 million,

37:40.467 --> 37:43.933
all for a movie that's bound to
be a steaming pile of shizz.

37:44.067 --> 37:45.700
With my name on it.

37:45.767 --> 37:46.767
Oh, hell no.

37:46.833 --> 37:48.300
I am tracking down
this producer

37:48.367 --> 37:50.600
and killing this
before it spreads.

37:50.667 --> 37:52.133
Raquel...

37:52.200 --> 37:53.367
What's wrong?

37:53.433 --> 37:55.067
Something came up
in my physical.

37:55.133 --> 37:56.267
I have to see
a doctor tomorrow.

37:56.333 --> 37:58.667
I'm sure you're fine.

37:58.733 --> 38:00.200
You're just outta practice.

38:00.267 --> 38:01.600
Hey, all of us
are hiding some injury.

38:01.667 --> 38:05.700
The doctor I have to see
is a cardiologist.

38:05.767 --> 38:09.767
It's my heart.

38:14.900 --> 38:17.767
Hey, is, uh,
Terrence around?

38:46.733 --> 38:48.067
I'll sign.

38:48.133 --> 38:49.367
But I have
one more condition.

38:49.433 --> 38:52.600
What more do you want?

38:52.667 --> 38:55.400
Ahsha has to come back
to the Devil Girls.

38:58.600 --> 39:01.633
Looks like I might have to
replace German.

39:01.700 --> 39:05.767
Oh... he's going to Boston...
with Ahsha.

39:05.833 --> 39:07.233
Yeah...

39:07.300 --> 39:09.067
I guess he doesn't want to
let her out of his sight.

39:09.133 --> 39:12.867
Well... you'd understand that
better than anyone.

39:12.933 --> 39:14.633
What do you mean?

39:14.700 --> 39:17.067
The bodyguard?

39:17.133 --> 39:18.700
What
bodyguard?

39:19.967 --> 39:22.233
Say a word
and you're dead.

39:24.067 --> 39:26.667
Sloane?

39:26.733 --> 39:30.100
I have to go.

39:30.167 --> 39:32.100
Love you.

39:32.167 --> 39:33.500
Okay, love you.

39:38.700 --> 39:40.633
Drive.

39:44.600 --> 39:46.400
Next time on "Hit the Floor"...

39:46.467 --> 39:47.500
We're having a party.

39:47.567 --> 39:48.500
The theme?

39:48.567 --> 39:50.067
Masquerade.

39:50.133 --> 39:51.633
I'm not gonna stay here

39:51.700 --> 39:53.700
just to watch you get caught up
with Derek Roman again.

39:53.767 --> 39:55.100
I don't want to be
your friend.

39:55.167 --> 39:56.400
As it worsens,
the heart becomes...

39:56.467 --> 39:59.733
Not the heart.
My heart.

39:59.800 --> 40:02.000
You have made me
very unhappy.

40:02.067 --> 40:04.333
Your happiness
no longer concerns me.

40:04.400 --> 40:06.600
Caged animals
are unpredictable...

40:06.667 --> 40:08.167
That's what Oscar is right now.

40:08.233 --> 40:10.467
You work for Oscar.
I do.

40:10.533 --> 40:13.233
Are you gonna kill me?
You're going to kill yourself.
