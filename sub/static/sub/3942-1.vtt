01:14.002 --> 01:18.666
DON'T CRY, MOMMY

01:27.315 --> 01:28.441
Yoo-lim!

01:31.986 --> 01:33.288
Thank you.

01:33.288 --> 01:34.846
She's already a great lawyer.

01:35.790 --> 01:36.950
How will you live now?.

01:39.294 --> 01:42.161
Just send the child support in time.

01:44.099 --> 01:45.259
Son of a bitch...

02:13.294 --> 02:16.598
I made a friend today,
named Soo-min.

02:16.598 --> 02:17.758
Yeah?.

02:18.199 --> 02:20.360
- Can I have her over some time?.
- Of course!

02:23.605 --> 02:25.368
How is it to be a high schooler?.

02:26.908 --> 02:27.966
I don't know yet.

02:29.811 --> 02:32.075
- Can I ask you something too?.
- Sure!

02:32.514 --> 02:33.776
What's it like to be divorced?.

02:35.984 --> 02:37.042
What about you?.

02:37.886 --> 02:38.987
About what?.

02:38.987 --> 02:41.854
How do you feel about our divorce?.

02:44.993 --> 02:46.460
I don't care.

02:49.197 --> 02:51.256
Dad was a jackass anyway.

03:02.810 --> 03:04.869
- Mom! You missed the left turn!
- Ah, right!

03:07.215 --> 03:08.546
It's okay, we can do a u-ey.

03:11.786 --> 03:13.253
Give me some too!

03:41.416 --> 03:42.684
Good afternoon!

03:42.684 --> 03:44.549
Hi there!

03:47.488 --> 03:49.891
You don't have to pick me up,

03:49.891 --> 03:52.860
I can come home with Soo-min.
She lives in the next building.

03:53.194 --> 03:55.196
Come over on your free time,

03:55.196 --> 03:57.664
I'll make you something nice.
I can cook really well!

03:58.199 --> 04:02.003
My mom can make really nice
chocolates and bread.

04:02.003 --> 04:03.605
Yeah?. Really?.

04:03.605 --> 04:06.507
Could you show us
how to make chocolates?.

04:06.507 --> 04:09.374
- Sure! Just drop by!
- Okay!

04:09.711 --> 04:10.871
Soo-min, let's go.

04:11.212 --> 04:12.413
We're off!

04:12.413 --> 04:14.716
Have fun studying!

04:14.716 --> 04:16.445
- Good bye!
- Bye!

04:32.400 --> 04:35.303
Wow, your flip turn's much better!

04:35.303 --> 04:37.005
You could compete at this level.

04:37.005 --> 04:38.666
No, I'm not that great.

04:39.207 --> 04:42.973
Did you find a shop yet?.
I heard you're opening a cafe.

04:43.311 --> 04:48.271
If the space is good,
the rent is too high, vice versa.

04:48.583 --> 04:50.949
I'm having a tough time
because of it.

04:57.392 --> 05:00.995
I think I have to leave early today.

05:00.995 --> 05:02.155
Sure.

05:05.500 --> 05:08.060
Why is it so black?.

05:08.403 --> 05:10.104
Was everything burned?.

05:10.104 --> 05:12.265
They say burned down spots are lucky.

05:13.107 --> 05:14.972
That can't be true.

05:16.010 --> 05:17.170
I'm serious.

05:17.812 --> 05:19.177
Really?.

05:19.714 --> 05:21.841
Mom, what if it burns down again?.

05:27.088 --> 05:29.556
Mom, my back is itchy.

05:30.191 --> 05:31.749
Yeah?.
Let me take a look.

05:31.993 --> 05:34.257
- Right here?.
- It's dark, no one can see.

05:35.897 --> 05:39.560
You're right.
The bra strap must be causing it.

05:40.201 --> 05:44.570
Mom...
could you buy me a new bra?.

05:45.006 --> 05:47.308
It's getting a little tight.

05:47.308 --> 05:50.912
Really?.
My baby's boobs are getting bigger?.

05:50.912 --> 05:52.513
Mom!!

05:52.513 --> 05:54.515
Let me feel them!

05:54.515 --> 05:55.583
No!!

05:55.583 --> 05:58.245
No fair, you fondled mine like crazy
when you were little!

05:58.686 --> 06:00.051
Let me feel 'em!

06:03.091 --> 06:04.456
Dammit!

06:05.893 --> 06:08.259
Where is that tool box?.

06:12.700 --> 06:13.860
Hello?.

06:14.302 --> 06:15.269
It's me.

06:15.803 --> 06:18.363
What?. I said no more calls.

06:19.607 --> 06:20.767
How is Eun-ah?.

06:21.109 --> 06:24.374
She's at school.
I told you to never call me.

06:26.614 --> 06:30.084
Can't you help me
with the conference?.

06:30.084 --> 06:33.747
Could you not call me
for something like this?.

06:34.589 --> 06:36.591
Let's at least keep
each other's distance.

06:36.591 --> 06:38.149
I'm not the same person I used to be!

06:44.399 --> 06:45.764
Ow, stomach cramps...

06:50.405 --> 06:51.963
What should we have for dinner?.

06:52.206 --> 06:53.508
I'm so starving!

06:53.508 --> 06:54.975
Should we get some burgers?.

07:03.684 --> 07:05.586
He's really hot!

07:05.586 --> 07:07.144
You gotta watch out for him.

07:07.588 --> 07:08.646
Why?.

07:09.290 --> 07:10.655
It's just...

07:11.592 --> 07:12.894
He repeated a grade,

07:12.894 --> 07:14.657
so he's a year older than us.

07:14.996 --> 07:17.157
So what?.

07:19.300 --> 07:20.665
What should we drink?.

07:22.203 --> 07:24.763
Isn't there a transfer student
named Eun-ah?.

07:25.106 --> 07:26.164
Who plays cello.

07:35.783 --> 07:37.045
What should I play?.

07:37.485 --> 07:39.544
Anything you play well.

07:41.289 --> 07:42.551
Whatever you want.

08:44.284 --> 08:45.149
You play well.

08:47.788 --> 08:50.450
Don't you go to my study room?.

08:52.293 --> 08:53.260
Yes.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.461
Got some time today?.

09:13.114 --> 09:14.376
New friend?.

09:14.982 --> 09:16.950
Yeah, my classmate.

09:17.885 --> 09:18.852
Want a ride?.

09:19.487 --> 09:20.647
It's okay.

09:21.188 --> 09:24.248
- See you tomorrow.
- Sure.

09:36.504 --> 09:37.664
'Classmate'?.

09:59.994 --> 10:01.359
It's done!

10:02.196 --> 10:04.061
Who will you give this to?.

10:05.600 --> 10:06.760
You don't need to know.

10:08.102 --> 10:09.403
But why ask?.

10:09.403 --> 10:13.271
Can't I even ask?.
You won't answer anyway.

10:14.709 --> 10:16.768
Soo-min, you know, don't you?.

10:17.912 --> 10:19.379
Not a word!

10:26.287 --> 10:29.950
Of course not!
He's just a boy from class.

10:30.291 --> 10:31.656
Boy from class?.

10:32.393 --> 10:34.452
Is he a good guy?.

10:35.496 --> 10:36.554
Not a hooligan?.

10:37.798 --> 10:43.065
No, I saw him a couple times,
he's the silent type.

10:43.904 --> 10:46.065
He kinda looks like...

10:48.509 --> 10:50.067
a bit like dad.

10:52.513 --> 10:55.539
Don't make the same mistake and
marry him after sleeping with him.

10:56.183 --> 11:00.347
What the...
I don't wanna hear stuff like that!

11:03.891 --> 11:05.654
Oki! Go bite mom!

11:07.194 --> 11:09.059
My dear Oki, you love me, don't you?.

11:22.410 --> 11:27.871
Could I see you at the study room?.
Got something to give you - Eun-ah

11:45.199 --> 11:46.461
What's done is done!

11:52.506 --> 11:54.974
Could I see you at the study room?.
Got something to give you - Eun-ah

12:01.015 --> 12:02.346
Yeah, it's me.

12:11.992 --> 12:14.756
Did you really text Jo-han?.

12:15.196 --> 12:16.163
Yeah.

12:16.797 --> 12:17.764
He replied?.

12:18.399 --> 12:19.559
Yep.

12:23.304 --> 12:23.904
Look at this.
What do I do?.

12:23.904 --> 12:25.963
Come to the roof in 10?.
Come alone.

12:28.609 --> 12:30.873
Karaoke for the second round!

12:32.113 --> 12:35.549
Did you drink too much?.
I'm sorry for making you drink.

12:35.783 --> 12:39.549
Not at all, it's just been a while.

12:41.689 --> 12:43.953
Looks like they're going to the karaoke.

12:44.391 --> 12:46.859
- Karaoke?.
- Yes, seems like it.

12:47.094 --> 12:49.153
Would be nice if you could come.

13:34.008 --> 13:35.168
You're here.

13:43.083 --> 13:44.744
It looks awful, doesn't it?.

13:47.488 --> 13:49.752
You don't like it?.

13:59.900 --> 14:02.869
Jo-han, there's someone here!

14:04.205 --> 14:07.868
Yoon Jo-han, you stupid fuck!

14:09.410 --> 14:13.369
Motherfucker, what you got here?.

14:20.187 --> 14:23.350
Is it awkward just the two of us?.

14:24.291 --> 14:27.094
Won't other people think it's weird,

14:27.094 --> 14:28.755
just us being here?.

14:29.897 --> 14:31.455
It's not like we'll see them anymore.

14:35.302 --> 14:38.965
Could you come help me
pick out a suit next week?.

14:50.284 --> 14:51.485
I'm going first!

14:51.485 --> 14:53.888
Fuck you, asshole!
I'm first this time!

14:53.888 --> 14:56.857
Shut the fuck up!

15:04.899 --> 15:06.059
Wait!

15:07.701 --> 15:10.504
- Did I do something wrong?.
- No,

15:10.504 --> 15:13.473
I don't feel right being here.
A little tired too.

15:13.908 --> 15:15.273
And my kid should be home by now.

15:15.809 --> 15:17.611
I'm sorry, take care.

15:17.611 --> 15:19.078
Will you still come to class?.

15:19.413 --> 15:21.315
Take it slow, bastard!

15:21.315 --> 15:23.384
Hold still, you fucking bitch!

15:23.384 --> 15:24.785
Hold still.

15:24.785 --> 15:26.343
Hold her down, motherfucker!

15:26.687 --> 15:30.190
Get her face,
make it recognizable!

15:30.190 --> 15:31.992
This is for your own good, bitch!

15:31.992 --> 15:33.459
Hey!
Bitch!

15:34.695 --> 15:36.959
Stay still!.

15:39.099 --> 15:41.067
Could she be in bed already?.

15:50.311 --> 15:52.472
Hold still dammit!

15:54.415 --> 15:56.747
Feels good?. Like that?.

15:57.685 --> 15:59.243
Look at her tears of joy!

16:09.096 --> 16:11.860
Emergency!. Please help.
9..48 PM - My baby Eun-ah

16:18.505 --> 16:23.374
Knock them out
and shut them up!

16:24.211 --> 16:25.974
Is this a police station?.!

16:27.014 --> 16:29.847
Fucking morons,
can't even keep the house in order!

16:36.790 --> 16:38.692
Always changing for a better future,

16:38.692 --> 16:41.957
this is detective Oh Hyun-sik.
How can I help you?.

16:48.902 --> 16:51.205
Yeah, Soo-min,
where's Eun-ah?.

16:51.205 --> 16:52.672
May I speak to Yoo Eun-ah's mother?.

16:59.213 --> 17:01.738
What?.
Who is this?.

17:07.988 --> 17:11.290
I'm looking for my daughter,
Yoo Eun-ah.

17:11.290 --> 17:12.656
She's over there.

17:21.402 --> 17:22.767
What happened to her?.

17:23.404 --> 17:26.006
- Why is she like this?.!
- Please calm down,

17:26.006 --> 17:27.207
I'll call the doctor.

17:27.207 --> 17:28.367
Doctor!

17:31.211 --> 17:35.082
She should be alright now.
We gave her some sedatives

17:35.082 --> 17:36.549
to calm her down.

17:37.284 --> 17:39.343
- Are you the mother?.
- Yes.

17:40.387 --> 17:41.649
It's, uh...

17:42.689 --> 17:46.147
This is will be hard to take in...

17:59.907 --> 18:02.774
Fortunately she wasn't hurt badly.

18:03.310 --> 18:07.314
We'll move her upstairs to the
7th floor ward

18:07.314 --> 18:09.544
and monitor her recovery there.

18:11.485 --> 18:13.953
Please change her into this.

18:36.910 --> 18:38.275
Mom...

19:12.913 --> 19:15.245
Where were you between 8 and 1 0 PM?.

19:16.183 --> 19:18.242
Why is that important!

19:19.786 --> 19:23.051
How did this happen to my child?.

19:24.491 --> 19:28.295
You said you have someone in custody.

19:28.295 --> 19:31.198
We must first assess the situation,

19:31.198 --> 19:32.665
Like why she couldn't reach anyone.

19:39.206 --> 19:40.366
Yeah?.

19:43.010 --> 19:46.275
Excuse me for a moment,
something urgent came up.

20:01.295 --> 20:02.262
Come in.

20:03.297 --> 20:05.599
- Come in.
- What a fucking whore!

20:05.599 --> 20:06.759
Don't push!

20:07.201 --> 20:09.465
- I'm going!
- Hurry up!

20:13.507 --> 20:16.271
Sit right there!

20:17.110 --> 20:20.414
You see that shit?.
She started convulsing on my turn!

20:20.414 --> 20:21.982
So I slapped her to snap her out

20:21.982 --> 20:24.685
and her eyes flipped!

20:24.685 --> 20:27.051
Fuck, I got a fucking jolt!

20:27.788 --> 20:29.389
I fucking saw that.

20:29.389 --> 20:31.792
I shrunk when that happened.

20:31.792 --> 20:32.952
Like this...

20:33.093 --> 20:36.358
She was like this!

20:37.598 --> 20:39.156
Fuck, I left my DS at the study room.

20:41.501 --> 20:42.661
You!

20:49.209 --> 20:50.369
What?.

20:50.911 --> 20:53.471
What's with the death ray?.

20:55.582 --> 20:59.040
Who the fuck are you?. Huh?.

20:59.886 --> 21:02.047
It's you, you did it?.!

21:03.790 --> 21:04.950
Get back!

21:05.792 --> 21:07.953
You little shits!

21:08.595 --> 21:09.496
It's them, isn't it!

21:09.496 --> 21:11.464
- Fine!
- Here, you can enter!

21:12.699 --> 21:15.065
But they're just kids!

21:15.702 --> 21:17.804
But they're just kids!

21:17.804 --> 21:18.964
On!

21:20.807 --> 21:21.967
On!

22:16.697 --> 22:19.860
Could you show me your shoulder?.
The bruised side.

22:28.208 --> 22:31.371
And your legs.

22:36.083 --> 22:38.449
Did you get the eye bruises then?.

22:40.687 --> 22:41.847
Yes.

22:42.289 --> 22:43.654
Are you done now?.

22:44.591 --> 22:48.960
Just a few questions.
When was your first period?.

22:50.597 --> 22:52.099
2 years ago.

22:52.099 --> 22:53.566
And recent period?.

22:55.001 --> 22:57.561
22nd last month.

22:58.105 --> 23:00.972
No prior... sexual experience?.

23:05.112 --> 23:06.477
No.

23:07.614 --> 23:10.242
Let's go get a thorough checkup.

23:54.995 --> 23:57.054
Come on, dig in.

24:01.802 --> 24:02.962
How's mom?.

24:05.405 --> 24:07.771
What happened to Eun-ah?.

24:09.109 --> 24:11.077
I took care of it, let it go.

24:14.014 --> 24:15.345
Go on.

24:18.785 --> 24:19.945
Dad.

24:20.987 --> 24:21.954
Yes?.

24:22.589 --> 24:24.352
Could I study abroad?.

24:29.095 --> 24:30.255
Why?.

24:31.498 --> 24:32.658
Just because.

24:34.701 --> 24:38.569
Eat your slice,
imagine that you're in Italy.

24:44.411 --> 24:45.776
Go on.

25:14.708 --> 25:18.269
Honey, you've been here for 2 hours.

25:18.912 --> 25:20.573
You never took this long.

25:21.414 --> 25:22.847
You're gonna catch a cold.

25:23.884 --> 25:25.943
Let's get you out.

25:29.789 --> 25:30.949
No,

25:32.692 --> 25:34.353
I'm still dirty...

25:36.096 --> 25:37.358
I'm so dirty...

25:41.001 --> 25:43.265
Why did this happen to me?.

25:45.005 --> 25:46.165
Why?.

25:59.085 --> 26:00.347
What do you think will happen?.

26:01.288 --> 26:02.346
Sir?.

26:03.089 --> 26:05.557
You got instincts,
how do you think it'll do?.

26:06.793 --> 26:11.059
The plaintiff may get
the short end of the deal...

26:13.700 --> 26:16.965
Do you remember the case
of 30 guys who killed a girl?.

26:18.905 --> 26:20.167
The Busan case.

26:20.907 --> 26:23.510
30 high schoolers raped and killed

26:23.510 --> 26:25.375
a girl two years junior.

26:26.012 --> 26:27.013
Right.

26:27.013 --> 26:29.243
Only 3 of them went to the juvies.

26:29.482 --> 26:32.747
And rest of them went home
the day after the trial.

26:34.087 --> 26:40.048
By comparison, Eun-ah's still alive
and breathing, fortunately.

26:40.493 --> 26:42.461
Her medical report isn't much
help either.

26:43.196 --> 26:47.565
Even if we send the boys to the juvies,
they'll be out in less than 2 months.

26:47.801 --> 26:51.168
These rapists are, unfortunately,
minors.

26:53.206 --> 26:54.673
Go tell her mother.

26:55.909 --> 27:01.848
Settle this out of court
and don't waste any legal fees.

27:02.582 --> 27:04.049
It's fucked up, but that's life.

27:15.595 --> 27:21.056
What a fucking country
to raise a child...

27:21.501 --> 27:23.264
Better off abroad.

27:29.809 --> 27:32.676
It's because the assailants are minors.

27:33.513 --> 27:35.037
- The law protects...
- And my child...

27:36.983 --> 27:38.644
isn't minor enough?.

27:42.989 --> 27:44.891
Their parents want a meet.

27:44.891 --> 27:46.358
Why do they want a meet?.

27:47.594 --> 27:49.061
Probably to settle.

27:53.600 --> 27:55.261
Settle what?.!

27:56.403 --> 27:59.861
The kids just fooled around,
couldn't we just settle?.

28:00.106 --> 28:03.769
We lost sleep over this.

28:05.211 --> 28:09.443
He's not as bad as he acts, my boy.

28:10.383 --> 28:13.443
He's got weak bronchus...

28:16.890 --> 28:20.155
You're wasting your time.
I'm fighting this.

28:20.994 --> 28:23.155
If you commit a crime,
you get punished.

28:24.597 --> 28:27.361
Just look at you!

28:27.801 --> 28:32.170
How'd we feel with our boys expelled
and behind bars?.!

28:33.106 --> 28:36.269
Honestly, you're not so clean either!

28:36.609 --> 28:38.668
Are you desperate to ruin their lives?.

28:39.112 --> 28:41.214
Mrs. Han, please stay out of this!

28:41.214 --> 28:43.341
I beg your pardon?.
What are you saying?.

28:43.783 --> 28:46.547
I hear you're divorced
with unstable household.

28:46.886 --> 28:50.390
And your kid's guilty too,
for hanging around our boys.

28:50.390 --> 28:52.792
Cause and effect,
isn't that what they call it?.

28:52.792 --> 28:54.851
Mrs. Han, will you please be quiet?.!

28:56.296 --> 28:59.663
Crime and punishment go hand in hand!
Don't you realize that?.

29:00.300 --> 29:02.063
That's law and common sense!

29:06.005 --> 29:11.272
Is it true that you sent a text to
the defendant Jo-han first?.

29:17.684 --> 29:18.844
Yes.

29:19.085 --> 29:24.751
Because you liked him and
wanted to give him a present?.

29:31.598 --> 29:33.361
I will now announce the verdict.

29:34.200 --> 29:38.660
The plaintiff claims
to have been raped by 3 defendants,

29:38.905 --> 29:41.908
but only Park Joon's semen

29:41.908 --> 29:44.968
were recovered,
and without witnesses,

29:45.311 --> 29:49.645
the actions of
remaining defendants are unclear.

29:50.083 --> 29:52.585
Therefore,

29:52.585 --> 29:56.954
I find Yoon Jo-han and Han Min-gu
not guilty due to lack of evidence.

29:59.092 --> 30:06.299
Even though Joon raped the plaintiff,
she did not suffer serious injuries,

30:06.299 --> 30:08.665
and she should claim
partial responsibility.

30:08.902 --> 30:13.706
Considering the fact
that Park Joon is a minor,

30:13.706 --> 30:17.210
he is sentenced to 2 years of probation.

30:17.210 --> 30:19.678
What?.! Not guilty?.!!

30:19.913 --> 30:21.380
Silence!

30:21.681 --> 30:25.447
My child was raped by those animals,
how could you let them go?.!

30:25.985 --> 30:27.748
Get over here!

30:28.488 --> 30:30.149
Is this justice?.!

30:30.790 --> 30:32.392
You get over here!

30:32.392 --> 30:34.952
- Silence!
- This is not fair!

30:42.802 --> 30:43.962
Ms. Kim...

30:50.910 --> 30:52.878
Is this how you do your job?.

30:55.682 --> 30:58.446
I' m sorry, there's no excuse...

30:58.785 --> 31:01.049
Who's being tried here?.

31:02.989 --> 31:04.251
Evidence?.

31:06.292 --> 31:08.954
No evidence?.
Just look at her!

31:56.609 --> 31:59.077
How many times do I have to tell you,
it's this side!

32:01.314 --> 32:02.941
Is this all you can do?.!

32:10.790 --> 32:13.054
That's enough, please go home.

32:15.194 --> 32:16.957
Go home!

32:45.992 --> 32:50.053
Eun-ah, it's lesson day.

32:55.902 --> 33:00.168
You must go to lessons
and school again,

33:01.007 --> 33:03.874
meet your friends,
we have to try.

33:06.913 --> 33:10.542
Or should we go on a trip?.

33:11.284 --> 33:15.448
You wanted to go to Jeju lsland.
Should we just take off?.

33:19.392 --> 33:20.552
Mom...

33:21.694 --> 33:22.854
Yes, honey?.

33:25.198 --> 33:34.163
Will it...
make everything go away?.

33:37.110 --> 33:39.874
Like nothing has happened to me...

33:47.086 --> 33:49.646
Fuck, stop looking at that!

33:51.190 --> 33:54.956
I thought we were fucked
for sure in the court.

33:56.095 --> 33:59.553
Others just settled,
but not this bitch.

33:59.999 --> 34:03.662
- Major shrinkage.
- I told you not to worry.

34:05.705 --> 34:08.868
Dumbass fuck!

34:09.208 --> 34:12.473
You were fucking scared shitless too!

34:13.813 --> 34:17.442
If we call her,
do you think she'll come?.

34:59.192 --> 35:03.458
You look good! If you don't come,
this is going online!

35:21.414 --> 35:22.540
Eun-ah!

35:23.182 --> 35:25.844
Eun-ah! Open this door!
Are you alright?.!

35:26.786 --> 35:28.549
What's going on!
Please open this door!

35:30.289 --> 35:36.159
Eun-ah! Please open the door!
What's going on!

35:36.896 --> 35:38.056
Eun-ah!

35:46.105 --> 35:48.972
- I'm going to cello lesson.
- Eun-ah!...

35:49.509 --> 35:50.669
Eun-ah!

36:25.711 --> 36:28.737
Past Star Karaoke,

36:59.612 --> 37:02.547
Hurry the fuck up!

37:38.884 --> 37:40.044
Come in.

37:43.689 --> 37:44.656
I said come!

38:01.507 --> 38:04.067
Why are you here at this hour?.

38:06.112 --> 38:09.047
Sweetheart, go inside.

38:09.982 --> 38:11.745
I' m not here to see you.

38:14.186 --> 38:16.051
Could we talk for a moment?.

38:18.991 --> 38:20.593
What's that for?.

38:20.593 --> 38:23.796
I'm so scared!

38:23.796 --> 38:25.354
So fucking scary!

38:26.499 --> 38:27.864
Give me the video!

38:29.802 --> 38:30.803
Give me the video!

38:30.803 --> 38:33.205
- Give me the video!
- Stab him! Stab!

38:33.205 --> 38:36.008
I'm so fucking scared!
Please don't kill me!

38:36.008 --> 38:37.976
Please don't kill me!

38:45.084 --> 38:46.745
Did you just cut me?.

39:11.711 --> 39:17.240
I'm preparing to file a lawsuit.
I want you to handle it.

39:18.484 --> 39:19.644
Why me?.

39:20.386 --> 39:22.854
You're the only female lawyer I know,

39:25.091 --> 39:28.151
and you proved yourself
with my divorce case.

39:31.697 --> 39:33.858
I don't know if we can work together.

39:37.903 --> 39:39.564
What outcome are you expecting?.

39:42.508 --> 39:43.873
Death penalty.

39:45.111 --> 39:46.373
All three of them.

42:31.510 --> 42:32.477
Eun-ah...

42:54.600 --> 42:57.865
Dad's not answering,
he must be busy.

42:58.504 --> 43:01.769
I gotta go to the market,
do you want to come?.

43:05.110 --> 43:06.168
No.

43:10.082 --> 43:13.449
Voice recording once
Twice if you leave a call number

43:15.988 --> 43:20.049
I need a favor,
this is for Eun-ah.

43:23.696 --> 43:25.097
Here are the candles.

43:25.097 --> 43:27.258
What message do you want on it?.

43:32.705 --> 43:34.570
Could I do it myself?.

43:43.983 --> 43:45.541
Eun-ah, I'm back!

43:49.088 --> 43:50.248
Eun-ah?.

44:16.682 --> 44:18.149
Eun-ah!

44:23.789 --> 44:26.053
Eun-ah, please wake up!

44:33.198 --> 44:36.065
Where's the car?.

44:37.202 --> 44:39.762
Eun-ah, please wake up!

44:41.006 --> 44:42.769
Please!

44:52.785 --> 44:54.252
Mom...

44:58.290 --> 45:00.349
don't cry...

45:09.001 --> 45:10.161
Eun-ah!

45:16.008 --> 45:17.168

45:18.010 --> 45:20.274
- Eun-ah! Open your eyes!
- Step aside.

45:21.113 --> 45:22.137
Doctor!

45:23.882 --> 45:25.349
Could you please stay here?.

45:26.485 --> 45:28.248
Move the bed this side, quick!

45:30.689 --> 45:33.157
Please call Dr. Choi

45:35.094 --> 45:38.655
It's 20..50 and 17-year-old girl.

45:40.699 --> 45:42.360
Check the blood pressure.

45:42.801 --> 45:44.002
Eun-ah, open your eyes!

45:44.002 --> 45:44.969
Dressing, please!

45:47.906 --> 45:49.874

45:50.509 --> 45:53.672
The blood loss is bad!
Move her to the ER!

47:08.287 --> 47:12.348
She was pronounced dead...
at 21 :20.

51:38.390 --> 51:40.858
Happy birthday!

57:56.000 --> 57:59.163
I really don't know,

You should know better!

58:34.205 --> 58:35.763
I'm giving this to the police.

58:36.808 --> 58:38.173
You'll be locked up,

58:39.611 --> 58:43.047

You hear me?.!

58:54.893 --> 58:57.054

You fucking whore!

59:06.104 --> 59:07.264

59:07.605 --> 59:09.607
No wonder
your daughter's fucked up!

59:09.607 --> 59:11.809
Bitch!

59:11.809 --> 59:12.969
Hey!

59:13.311 --> 59:15.280
- Hey, police!
- Stop!

59:15.280 --> 59:16.481

Are you okay?.

59:45.109 --> 59:46.269
Are you feeling okay?.

59:46.911 --> 59:49.539
- Did you catch him?.
- In this case,

59:50.882 --> 59:53.942
he'll be locked up for 2 weeks.

59:59.290 --> 01:00:01.952
- Forget it.
- Pardon?.

01:00:03.194 --> 01:00:08.757
It wasn't Park Joon.
It was someone else.

01:00:09.801 --> 01:00:10.961
What are you saying?.

01:00:11.402 --> 01:00:13.666
The officer caught him at the scene.

01:00:16.007 --> 01:00:17.668
He's not it.

01:00:19.410 --> 01:00:20.570
Don't you want to punish him for it?.

01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:34.654
Consider yourself lucky, asshole.

01:00:49.407 --> 01:00:50.567
What is it?.

01:00:52.610 --> 01:00:57.138
A token of appreciation
for not pressing charges.

01:00:58.282 --> 01:00:59.544
Please take it.

01:00:59.984 --> 01:01:01.451
Take it back,

01:01:02.286 --> 01:01:03.651
you'll need it.

01:02:11.589 --> 01:02:12.749
Yoon Jo-han?.

01:02:19.697 --> 01:02:21.164
Do you recognize me?.

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.001
Why are you doing this?.

01:02:24.001 --> 01:02:27.266
Did you do it to my Eun-ah too?.

01:02:32.009 --> 01:02:33.476
Who planned this?.

01:02:34.412 --> 01:02:37.438
I just did what they told me to do.

01:02:38.483 --> 01:02:40.451
They said they'd kill me
if I don't bring her.

01:02:43.488 --> 01:02:45.547
I didn't know it'd go this far,
it wasn't supposed to end like this!

01:02:47.191 --> 01:02:48.453
Who ordered it?.

01:02:49.093 --> 01:02:51.152
- Please let me go...
- I said who!

01:02:51.395 --> 01:02:52.760
Is it you or Park Joon?.!

01:02:53.498 --> 01:02:55.363
It was them, all of them...

01:02:58.803 --> 01:03:00.862
Where is Han Min-gu?.

01:03:02.006 --> 01:03:04.372
I don't know, I really don't!

01:03:06.410 --> 01:03:07.570
Call him.

01:03:08.112 --> 01:03:10.546
If he doesn't answer,
you'll die too.

01:03:13.284 --> 01:03:14.251
Now!

01:03:23.094 --> 01:03:24.254
That picture...

01:03:30.301 --> 01:03:31.859
I didn't dislike Eun-ah.

01:03:33.404 --> 01:03:37.170
It just...
got out of hands somehow...

01:03:37.909 --> 01:03:39.069
What?.

01:03:40.511 --> 01:03:41.637
""Somehow"?.

01:03:41.879 --> 01:03:43.141
Please...

01:03:49.287 --> 01:03:50.754
Han Min-gu, it's because of him.

01:03:51.589 --> 01:03:54.854
He'd have beaten me to death.

01:03:57.094 --> 01:04:02.657
Do you know how much she liked you?.

01:04:11.509 --> 01:04:12.669
Go!

01:04:17.181 --> 01:04:19.149
Before I change my mind.

01:04:42.807 --> 01:04:45.409
Past Star Karaoke,
turn right at the intersection

01:04:45.409 --> 01:04:48.173
Come to apartment E

01:05:29.186 --> 01:05:32.246
Come to apartment E

01:06:57.308 --> 01:07:01.212
Motherfucker,

01:07:01.212 --> 01:07:02.645
if you mess with me again!

01:07:08.386 --> 01:07:10.854
Why the fuck is it open again?.

01:07:17.094 --> 01:07:21.554
Shit, I'll kill those fuckers!

01:07:33.310 --> 01:07:35.835
Fucking bastard!

01:07:39.183 --> 01:07:41.845
OK! You're dead.

01:07:51.796 --> 01:07:53.559
What the fuck?.!

01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:57.663
You raped my daughter!

01:07:58.502 --> 01:07:59.764
Where's your cell?.!

01:08:00.905 --> 01:08:02.566
Give me the video!

01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:12.044
How the fuck did you get in here?.

01:08:16.587 --> 01:08:19.147
Did you just fucking stab me?.

01:08:19.790 --> 01:08:21.992
Try stabbing me again,

01:08:21.992 --> 01:08:23.550
you fucking bitch!

01:08:30.801 --> 01:08:32.166
Fuck you asshole!

01:08:34.305 --> 01:08:36.170
Fuck up!

01:08:38.809 --> 01:08:41.779
Did you fucking stab me?.

01:08:41.779 --> 01:08:43.246
Fuck up!

01:08:53.290 --> 01:08:57.694
Hey! Lady!

01:08:57.694 --> 01:08:59.356
Leaving already?.

01:09:00.397 --> 01:09:02.661
No fucking way!

01:09:11.809 --> 01:09:12.969
Lady.

01:09:19.283 --> 01:09:21.843
Are you fucking ignoring me?.

01:09:23.386 --> 01:09:28.450
Should I fuck you too,
like your kid?.

01:09:29.993 --> 01:09:32.359
I'm fucking good at it.

01:09:34.698 --> 01:09:36.359
Did you plan this?.

01:09:37.201 --> 01:09:38.566
Was it you?.

01:09:39.703 --> 01:09:46.310
That's right! I did it!
I fucked her over and over again!

01:09:46.310 --> 01:09:49.380
Is that what you wanted to hear?.

01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:51.439
Should I make you feel good too?.

01:09:52.582 --> 01:09:53.550
Hey!

01:13:14.284 --> 01:13:16.149
Fuck you, asshole!

01:13:25.496 --> 01:13:26.463
Fuck!

01:13:37.908 --> 01:13:39.569
What the fuck...

01:13:42.479 --> 01:13:44.140
We're not done.

01:13:46.683 --> 01:13:48.150
Bad fucking luck...

01:13:48.585 --> 01:13:50.052
You did it, didn't you?.

01:13:51.188 --> 01:13:55.352
It's okay, answer me,
she's dead anyway.

01:13:59.696 --> 01:14:04.701
Who called her back out?.
Who planned this?.

01:14:04.701 --> 01:14:07.261
Why are you fucking up my ass?.!

01:14:08.705 --> 01:14:11.071
What the fuck!

01:14:12.810 --> 01:14:14.411
Fuck!

01:14:14.411 --> 01:14:17.141
These crazy fucking bitches...

01:14:17.681 --> 01:14:20.343
Why are you up my ass?.!

01:14:21.084 --> 01:14:25.544
Retarded bitch,
killing herself and shit.

01:14:38.101 --> 01:14:39.864
What the fuck!

01:16:16.700 --> 01:16:19.102
Speak clearly so that I can hear,
fuck!

01:16:19.102 --> 01:16:20.203
What is she saying?.

01:16:20.203 --> 01:16:22.967
Shut the fuck up!

01:16:24.207 --> 01:16:27.010
What were their names again?.

01:16:27.010 --> 01:16:29.035
Park Joon, Han Min-gu, and...

01:16:37.688 --> 01:16:38.848
Sir.

01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:51.568
- Detective Song.
- Yes, sir.

01:16:52.302 --> 01:16:53.860
Put out an APB for Kim Yoo-lim.

01:17:57.701 --> 01:17:58.963
Find anything?.

01:17:59.603 --> 01:18:04.267
I searched by JPG and AVl
but nothing special.

01:18:06.109 --> 01:18:08.236
Sir, look.

01:18:08.578 --> 01:18:12.139
Look at the camera, bitch!

01:18:14.885 --> 01:18:17.149
- Was it Jo-han?.
- Yes, sir.

01:18:17.788 --> 01:18:19.153
Where is that bastard?.

01:18:20.490 --> 01:18:22.754
- Where's his room?.
- That way sir.

01:18:31.001 --> 01:18:33.603
Sir, check this out.

01:18:33.603 --> 01:18:35.706
Hold still, you fucking bitch!

01:18:35.706 --> 01:18:36.764
Hold her down, motherfucker!

01:18:38.508 --> 01:18:41.272
Get her face!

01:18:41.778 --> 01:18:43.541
Hold still!

01:18:44.981 --> 01:18:46.539
Hold still!

01:18:50.387 --> 01:18:53.550
This may already be online...

01:19:01.298 --> 01:19:03.960
Officer Goh, go and grab Yoon Jo-han.

01:19:04.501 --> 01:19:05.763
I' m on my way.

01:19:06.503 --> 01:19:07.904
Detective Song, look for more.

01:19:07.904 --> 01:19:09.064
And you stay here.

01:19:09.306 --> 01:19:11.467
I'm sorry!
I was scared too!

01:19:13.410 --> 01:19:17.380
Why didn't you tell me?.!
Why did you lie about it?.!

01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:19.439
They said if I tell the truth...

01:19:20.984 --> 01:19:24.442
It's killing me too!
I don't want to deal with it anymore!

01:19:24.988 --> 01:19:28.754
If I come forward now,
can you send them away?.

01:19:29.392 --> 01:19:33.260
Daddy! I'll tell the truth!
Please do something!

01:19:33.597 --> 01:19:37.055
I'm scared of them and
Eun-ah too...

01:19:51.882 --> 01:19:52.849
Hello?.

01:19:53.183 --> 01:19:54.445
Mr. Oh...

01:19:55.285 --> 01:19:56.343
Ms. Kim?.

01:19:57.687 --> 01:19:59.655
- It's all over.
- Ms. Kim?.

01:20:00.090 --> 01:20:03.856
I killed Park Joon and Han Min-gu.

01:20:05.295 --> 01:20:07.097
And I destroyed their cell phones.

01:20:07.097 --> 01:20:10.863
What will you do now?.
Will you give yourself up?.

01:20:11.601 --> 01:20:14.069
- There's no reason for me to live.
- Ms. Kim,

01:20:14.304 --> 01:20:17.364
please, listen to me carefully.

01:20:18.108 --> 01:20:19.166
We just obtained vital evidence.

01:20:19.509 --> 01:20:22.444
Evidence that implicate them
for planning the rape.

01:20:23.780 --> 01:20:26.248
Please trust me and come see me.

01:20:26.483 --> 01:20:28.747
I won't let this case end in vain!

01:20:30.287 --> 01:20:33.450
I'll put Jo-han on the stand!

01:20:35.592 --> 01:20:40.256
He... made the videos?.

01:20:42.199 --> 01:20:45.259
Jo-han planned it all?.

01:20:45.802 --> 01:20:49.067
Yes, looks Like Jo-han planned
the whole thing.

01:20:58.982 --> 01:21:02.145
Ms. Kim! Please!

01:23:18.888 --> 01:23:21.652
Get back to your class!

01:23:21.992 --> 01:23:25.655
Hurry! Get back to your class!

01:23:26.096 --> 01:23:28.758
A spectacle?.
Go get in!

01:23:33.103 --> 01:23:37.107
Dad! Eun-ah's mom...

01:23:37.107 --> 01:23:38.972
Isn't it blood?.

01:23:41.211 --> 01:23:43.543
Sir, it's the roof!

01:23:44.381 --> 01:23:46.683
Is the ambulance here?.!
Bring them up!

01:23:46.683 --> 01:23:48.150
Hey, quickly,
don't you guys get in?.

01:23:58.495 --> 01:24:01.055
Detective Song, secure the building!

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:04.760
Ms. Kim!

01:24:07.203 --> 01:24:08.363
Drop the knife!

01:24:10.306 --> 01:24:11.967
Sir, don't let her kill me!

01:24:12.409 --> 01:24:13.967
Please drop the knife!

01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:17.838
Please!

01:24:20.583 --> 01:24:24.542
Did you shoot those videos?.

01:24:28.391 --> 01:24:32.657
Was it a lie, that you liked Eun-ah?.

01:24:33.897 --> 01:24:36.058
I told you we have the evidence.

01:24:36.499 --> 01:24:40.162
He's the only one left,
but we can still put him on trial.

01:24:40.403 --> 01:24:41.504
Evidence?.

01:24:41.504 --> 01:24:45.270
That's right, you shit!
The videos in your PC!

01:24:47.610 --> 01:24:48.941
Ms. Kim!

01:24:49.479 --> 01:24:52.642
For Eun-ah,
we have to put him in court!

01:24:55.785 --> 01:24:57.047
Apologize!

01:24:58.888 --> 01:25:00.890
Apologize to my Eun-ah!

01:25:00.890 --> 01:25:02.050
Ms. Kim!

01:25:02.992 --> 01:25:05.961
Killing him won't
bring your daughter back to life!

01:25:13.303 --> 01:25:18.468
Mr. Oh, if Soo-min was raped,

01:25:21.311 --> 01:25:24.439
what would you do in my place?.

01:25:27.584 --> 01:25:29.643
I'm going to hell anyways.

01:25:31.287 --> 01:25:35.656
I'm tired. I want this to be over.

01:25:37.193 --> 01:25:41.598
Why is it my fault that
she decided to kill herself?.!

01:25:41.598 --> 01:25:43.862
