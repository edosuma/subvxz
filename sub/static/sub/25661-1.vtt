02:51.625 --> 02:52.625
Good morning, Mother Superior.

02:57.416 --> 03:00.708
Be good. Thank you, sister. Okay.

03:07.916 --> 03:10.666
Leave this pallet for last.
Load the others up first.

03:11.833 --> 03:14.291
Bruno, you do the 8:30 load.

03:14.375 --> 03:17.375
-But I clock off at 8:00.
-Load up, then clock off.

03:18.541 --> 03:20.083
Guido, what the fuck are you doing?

03:22.500 --> 03:24.333
What the fuck are you doing? Get off.

03:44.750 --> 03:49.416
Now that was hard, wasn't it?
You're not cut out for this job.

03:50.041 --> 03:53.583
-You nearly overturned it too.
-But I didn't. You can go.

03:54.708 --> 03:55.833
You're firing me?

03:55.916 --> 03:58.041
You can't drive the truck!
You're no use to me!

04:01.000 --> 04:02.875
Well? Get back to work!

04:26.000 --> 04:31.666
FORGIVE US OUR DEBTS

04:46.750 --> 04:47.625
Good evening.

04:55.625 --> 04:58.250
-Viktor's not here?
-No, I am.

05:00.541 --> 05:02.666
-And who are you?
-A friend.

05:05.083 --> 05:06.125
Where is he?

05:08.333 --> 05:10.541
Viktor's gone back home, his uncle died.

05:11.958 --> 05:17.083
-Sorry to hear that. Will he be back?
-Well, his uncle won't.

05:20.708 --> 05:21.666
Here.

05:22.208 --> 05:23.208
-Is this mine?
-Yes.

05:23.750 --> 05:27.583
-I haven't ordered yet.
-Is this not it?

05:27.666 --> 05:29.916
-No, that's not my drink.
-Sorry. Which one is it?

05:30.333 --> 05:32.958
That one, in front of you.
No, on the left.

05:33.041 --> 05:35.333
-On the left.
-That one.

05:35.416 --> 05:36.958
-Sorry.
-No problem.

05:37.916 --> 05:41.583
Don't worry,
Viktor will be back in three days.

05:46.666 --> 05:47.750
Is Viktor not here?

05:48.166 --> 05:49.916
No, Viktor's not here.

05:51.958 --> 05:56.041
-Can I have a liter of milk?
-Of course. Here you are.

05:57.166 --> 05:58.583
-Thanks.
-Bye.

05:58.666 --> 05:59.666
Goodbye.

06:04.166 --> 06:08.625
-Viktor filled me in about everyone.
-You got mine wrong, though.

06:08.708 --> 06:10.958
That's right. I don't know why.

06:11.625 --> 06:17.750
Here it says you always sit in the corner,
you drink whisky... and...

06:19.916 --> 06:23.916
you look like an old deflated dinghy.

06:28.083 --> 06:30.083
Don't look at me like that.
They're his words.

06:35.541 --> 06:37.333
-What's your name?
-Sorry.

06:37.416 --> 06:38.541
-What's your name?
-Rina.

06:39.500 --> 06:44.250
-Rina... Can I have another, please?
-Of course.

07:03.208 --> 07:04.875
Fuck. The bastards!

07:57.208 --> 08:00.625
-Guido!
-Professor, I saw you were still up.

08:00.708 --> 08:02.916
I suffered from insomnia when I was 20,

08:03.000 --> 08:06.333
-so just imagine now.
-Isn't that music a bit loud?

08:07.000 --> 08:09.041
No one's complained so far.

08:09.125 --> 08:14.291
-They have, but you don't hear them.
-I don't want to hear them.

08:14.875 --> 08:17.416
My fridge is broken.
Can I put this stuff in yours?

08:17.500 --> 08:19.166
Yes, of course, come in.

08:22.291 --> 08:24.458
-It's no use...
-What?

08:24.541 --> 08:29.041
There are areas on the snooker table
that are hardly ever used.

08:29.125 --> 08:32.582
-If you stick to some rules.
-What rules are those?

08:34.500 --> 08:41.375
The first is... never attack head-on
a country more powerful than you.

08:41.457 --> 08:45.541
If, for example,
ball number seven is Germany,

08:45.625 --> 08:47.666
and ball number three is the USA...

08:47.750 --> 08:49.625
Another political-ballistic theory--

08:49.708 --> 08:54.666
If I play with number five,
which is Italy...

08:57.625 --> 09:03.041
Portugal! It's always a poor country
that ends up in the hole.

09:03.541 --> 09:04.458
And look here!

09:05.708 --> 09:10.208
The tobacco industries,
pharmaceutical industries and banks...

09:11.250 --> 09:14.875
the arms industry, all intact!

09:15.458 --> 09:18.166
They weren't even touched
in the manoeuver.

09:18.250 --> 09:19.375
What manoeuver?

09:19.958 --> 09:21.375
-Don't you believe me?
-No.

09:21.458 --> 09:24.833
See if you can do it.
They're shielded by seven and three.

09:25.375 --> 09:30.500
And there's no way Germany and the USA
will let Italy intimidate them.

09:30.583 --> 09:35.666
-What are you talking about?
-Then try it. Try it.

09:36.375 --> 09:40.750
Right... The aim is to knock
this cigarette packet off. Right?

09:40.833 --> 09:41.833
Yes.

09:44.875 --> 09:46.375
No! Stop!

09:47.041 --> 09:49.666
You can't make a straight hit

09:49.750 --> 09:53.625
at the big industries
like tobacco and pharmaceuticals.

09:53.708 --> 09:55.833
Why? It's not a powerful country.
The rule--

09:55.916 --> 09:57.375
There are different rules.

09:57.791 --> 10:01.625
The second depends on fractals.
Do you know what fractals are?

10:01.708 --> 10:02.708
No.

10:03.125 --> 10:09.166
A fractal is a mathematical system
that is repeated to infinity.

10:09.500 --> 10:12.416
It has the same structure
as a cauliflower.

10:12.666 --> 10:15.458
If you break off a piece of cauliflower,

10:15.541 --> 10:21.000
this new piece is an identical
smaller version of the mother.

10:21.416 --> 10:25.791
The Italian political-economic system
is like a fractal.

10:26.416 --> 10:31.666
All it does is reproduce models that have
already been tried out. A cauliflower.

10:31.916 --> 10:37.708
You can't make a direct hit
at the pharmaceutical or arms industries.

10:37.791 --> 10:41.000
You just can't! It's never been done.

10:41.625 --> 10:45.291
If you want to do it,
you have to do it indirectly.

10:46.041 --> 10:48.708
But you'll never get anywhere!

10:48.791 --> 10:52.166
So, if I bounce it off there,
I can hit ball seven, right?

10:52.250 --> 10:55.416
You can hit Germany indirectly!

10:55.500 --> 10:58.916
That's what I've been trying to do
since this morning.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.416
-You've swallowed Greece!
-Well...

11:06.916 --> 11:09.750
The poor Greeks.
You really are insensitive!

11:09.833 --> 11:12.166
With all the problems they have already!

11:13.750 --> 11:19.875
I believe...
the only way possible is... a collision!

11:20.916 --> 11:21.791
Yes.

11:22.500 --> 11:27.958
The only way to hit out at the powers
that be, is to get involved, dear Guido.

11:28.500 --> 11:32.958
Pure chaos, incontrollable entropy.

11:33.041 --> 11:34.500
A collision!

11:34.666 --> 11:37.666
Professor, I'm very fond of you,
but you're a crazy conspirator.

11:37.750 --> 11:42.500
Yes! I am a crazy conspirator!
You're right, it's true.

11:42.833 --> 11:46.000
Come here,
I'll get you a glass of licorice liqueur.

11:46.500 --> 11:48.333
You can tell me if it's any good.

11:53.541 --> 11:57.791
There's a place here
for conspirators like me.

11:59.166 --> 12:00.541
-In China?
-In China!

12:01.250 --> 12:03.333
There's a very remote town

12:03.416 --> 12:08.208
where money has never caught on
in such a terrifying way.

12:08.291 --> 12:12.916
Just think, bartering lies
at the heart of social relationships.

12:13.583 --> 12:15.416
A place that doesn't use money?

12:16.500 --> 12:21.208
There's another system that perhaps
doesn't exclude people as ours does.

12:22.000 --> 12:26.791
-I wonder how one keeps in the system.
-I never worked it out.

12:27.500 --> 12:31.000
I never succeeded, and I never will.

12:37.250 --> 12:42.166
-When were you there?
-Three months before she died.

12:43.750 --> 12:46.750
It was my first trip
on an Italian passport.

12:53.416 --> 12:56.208
Professor, if you go to China,
who'll put my stuff in the fridge?

12:57.166 --> 13:00.333
Have they decided to take you on
at the warehouse?

13:01.208 --> 13:02.125
Not yet.

13:02.333 --> 13:04.666
-Guido, take this.
-No.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.208
You can't be without electricity.
You just can't. Come on!

13:10.875 --> 13:11.875
It's too much.

13:11.958 --> 13:15.041
One hundred fifty euros too much?
Take it.

13:17.333 --> 13:21.083
-I'll pay you back as soon as I can.
-Don't worry, I won it.

13:21.541 --> 13:25.208
-I've found a bar full of mugs.
-Thanks, Professor.

13:49.291 --> 13:50.416
Have you got a light?

13:55.500 --> 13:56.958
Remember to pay your debts!

14:17.666 --> 14:18.625
Good morning.

14:42.333 --> 14:45.500
-Good morning, sir.
-Zegni, nice to see you.

14:45.583 --> 14:46.833
-How are things?
-Fine.

14:47.750 --> 14:51.458
-Mrs. Sala?
-She's just popped out.

14:51.541 --> 14:54.791
-Wait here. She won't be long.
-No. I'll wait downstairs.

14:54.875 --> 14:56.041
-As you wish.
-Thank you.

14:56.125 --> 14:57.708
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

14:57.791 --> 14:59.041
Bye.

14:59.458 --> 15:03.750
I have this to offer you.
If you succeed, I'd be happier than you.

15:03.833 --> 15:05.375
-He's given us a hard time.
-Let's hear it.

15:05.458 --> 15:07.458
His name's Sergio Gavarino.

15:07.541 --> 15:12.291
An engineer, who in the 1990s
paved the buildings in the Arab Emirates.

15:12.375 --> 15:13.375
He's now bankrupt.

15:13.958 --> 15:19.750
He borrowed the sum of 260,000 euros
from us back in 2009.

15:20.833 --> 15:23.791
We've only seen 60. Nothing we could do.

15:25.041 --> 15:27.000
We wrote it off last week.

15:29.625 --> 15:30.708
How much?

15:30.791 --> 15:32.750
-This is a Category A debt!
-How much?

15:34.125 --> 15:37.458
-No less than 19,000.
-Nineteen thousand?

15:38.041 --> 15:40.000
It offers great potential.

15:40.083 --> 15:43.875
If there's a lot of potential,
get your own debt collectors to do it.

15:44.666 --> 15:46.500
I can do it for 16,000.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.583
Out of the question.
I won't buy anyone over four percent.

15:50.666 --> 15:53.708
Yes, but this is no routine case.
It's 200,000 euros!

15:53.791 --> 15:55.333
Which we might never get back.

15:55.666 --> 15:57.708
I'm sure you'll find a way
to get the money.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.000
We have a rule. Four percent or nothing.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.916
All right, four percent.

16:06.416 --> 16:10.500
And I've got three other
interesting businessmen.

16:15.541 --> 16:20.250
Why don't you give me a few pen pushers,
or workmen, losers, people like that?

16:21.625 --> 16:23.000
Walking dead.

16:24.666 --> 16:26.875
You know my thoughts, right?
The hard-core.

16:27.833 --> 16:30.750
We have plenty of those, look.

16:31.416 --> 16:36.416
We have a client called Maurizio Pegollo,
occasional construction worker,

16:36.875 --> 16:40.166
his debt amounts to 30,000
for court expenses.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.750
Then we have Mr. and Mrs. Massi,

16:42.958 --> 16:46.041
both unemployed
but with two inherited homes.

16:46.541 --> 16:50.125
They took out loans
at two different times,

16:50.208 --> 16:51.416
when their children were born.

16:54.333 --> 16:56.833
Crazy, first they have kids,
then apply for a loan.

16:56.916 --> 16:58.125
It's madness.

16:59.666 --> 17:01.041
What about this?

17:03.000 --> 17:05.625
Fifteen thousand to go on holiday!

17:08.208 --> 17:10.958
Okay, all of them at three percent.

17:11.040 --> 17:12.583
-You're a rogue.
-Yes.

17:26.290 --> 17:27.625
-Hi there.
-Hi.

17:29.708 --> 17:32.416
-Can you give me a hand?
-Is it stuck?

17:32.500 --> 17:33.500
Yes, it's stuck.

17:50.083 --> 17:51.541
Oh, no, fuck!

17:51.875 --> 17:54.250
I'm sorry. Come and wash your hands.

17:59.833 --> 18:01.500
-Here's some soap.
-Thanks.

18:17.291 --> 18:18.500
-Here.
-Thanks.

18:22.416 --> 18:26.916
-I'm making myself a coffee. Want one?
-Whisky?

18:27.000 --> 18:29.041
-Whisky? At this hour?
-Yes.

18:29.791 --> 18:30.958
Of course, help yourself.

18:31.500 --> 18:32.833
-Shall I do it?
-Yes.

18:40.041 --> 18:41.250
-Here.
-Thanks.

18:53.708 --> 18:54.583
Everything okay?

18:54.666 --> 18:56.625
-Yeah, you?
-Yes.

19:00.083 --> 19:03.125
Thanks. Sorry, I have to run.

19:03.333 --> 19:05.791
Okay. Where are you running to
dressed like that?

19:06.416 --> 19:07.666
I have something to sort out.

19:07.750 --> 19:10.125
-Dressed like what?
-You look nice.

19:12.625 --> 19:13.875
-Bye.
-Thanks.

19:14.666 --> 19:16.625
Thanks for the whisky. Bye.

19:19.875 --> 19:21.958
Paying off a debt restores one's dignity.

19:25.958 --> 19:27.625
I cannot pay off my debt.

19:31.791 --> 19:34.958
I misunderstood.
I thought that's why you were here.

19:37.958 --> 19:39.750
I don't see any other reason.

19:47.291 --> 19:49.041
I'll never have that kind of money.

19:50.041 --> 19:53.208
I have other debts too,
and I've just lost my job.

19:58.708 --> 20:01.625
This is rather annoying, Mr. Rabaglia.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.875
What job are we talking about,
if I may ask?

20:15.458 --> 20:16.416
Warehouseman.

20:18.791 --> 20:19.916
Warehouseman?

20:24.125 --> 20:26.166
And how do you intend
to settle your debt with us?

20:28.250 --> 20:30.208
I'll be honest with you,

20:31.500 --> 20:34.083
I hope you don't expect us
to write off this sum.

20:35.416 --> 20:40.208
-It doesn't work that way.
-I want to work for you.

20:43.791 --> 20:45.291
You want to work for us?

20:47.750 --> 20:51.291
I don't have any money.
I can only pay you with my time.

20:53.333 --> 20:55.666
I'll work for free
until my debt is paid off.

20:58.583 --> 21:00.791
I've seen how you do it. I can do it too.

22:31.166 --> 22:33.000
-Hello, Candy!
-Hi.

22:33.750 --> 22:36.416
-How are things?
-Fine, and you?

22:37.333 --> 22:38.291
Fine.

22:39.375 --> 22:43.375
Take a look at this,
then tell me I'm not number one.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.333
I've brought home five out of ten cases!

22:46.416 --> 22:47.833
-Five out of ten?
-Yes.

22:47.916 --> 22:48.750
Well done.

22:48.833 --> 22:51.958
You can say that again!
Make sure the right person hears it!

22:52.375 --> 22:53.375
What about the other five?

22:53.875 --> 22:57.958
Give me a bit more time
for the other five. Three need persuading.

22:58.041 --> 22:59.875
I'll take Angelo with me now.

22:59.958 --> 23:02.541
You're not taking Angelo today.
You're taking him.

23:03.500 --> 23:05.708
-Who?
-The guy in the waiting room.

23:21.583 --> 23:25.083
-Who the fuck is he?
-A new guy. You have to train him.

23:27.375 --> 23:28.958
-Did he say that?
-Yes.

23:32.291 --> 23:35.166
-I'll have a word with him.
-He's not in a good mood today.

23:56.041 --> 23:59.000
Why do I always have
to train the dumbasses?

24:04.916 --> 24:08.750
I'm not doing it. I can spot idiots
straightaway! And that guy's an idiot!

24:16.041 --> 24:18.958
No! I'm the best here.
Let Rolando take the idiot out.

24:20.750 --> 24:23.500
I said no! I've got work to do.
I'm not taking him!

24:35.000 --> 24:35.833
Let's go.

24:36.833 --> 24:40.833
-What was your previous job?
-Warehouseman.

24:42.166 --> 24:43.208
Warehouseman...

24:44.416 --> 24:46.750
With that face,
you'll have lasted half an hour!

24:46.833 --> 24:48.750
I meant before. Your real job.

24:51.458 --> 24:54.125
-I was a computer technician.
-And?

24:56.541 --> 24:57.458
What?

25:00.958 --> 25:02.166
Did you get fired?

25:02.666 --> 25:05.791
No, I resigned 'cause I always dreamed
of being a warehouseman.

25:05.875 --> 25:08.833
I mean if they went bust
or they fired you.

25:09.541 --> 25:11.708
The company went bust,
and we were all made redundant.

25:13.750 --> 25:16.583
What about the warehouse?
Did that go bust too?

25:17.666 --> 25:18.875
No, they got rid of me.

25:21.833 --> 25:23.083
Why did they get rid of you?

25:29.833 --> 25:33.916
Why did they get rid of you?
Are you married? Any kids?

25:34.458 --> 25:35.958
Didn't they tell you all about me?

25:39.500 --> 25:41.500
I'm sorry to be a nuisance to you,

25:41.708 --> 25:44.291
but I'm not that keen
about being with you either.

25:44.666 --> 25:47.416
So show me how to do this damn job
and no hard feelings.

25:48.916 --> 25:51.666
-No hard feelings?
-It's just an expression.

25:54.083 --> 25:55.208
Listen up...

25:59.416 --> 26:00.375
Willy.

26:03.958 --> 26:05.291
Do you know why I called you Willy?

26:08.375 --> 26:09.375
Do you?

26:12.083 --> 26:14.791
Fuck, I have to drag things out of you
with pliers.

26:16.458 --> 26:21.458
It's easy. I ask you a question.
If you know, say yes. Otherwise, say no.

26:21.541 --> 26:22.916
-Do you know or not?
-No.

26:24.916 --> 26:28.916
-Didn't you watch Wile E. Coyote?
-Yes.

26:31.125 --> 26:34.041
Wile E. Coyote thought he knew everything,
but he didn't know shit.

26:34.833 --> 26:36.291
Then Road Runner came along...

26:40.750 --> 26:42.750
The ostrich,
and he screwed him every time.

26:45.333 --> 26:46.583
He's not an ostrich.

26:46.666 --> 26:49.583
Then what? You a philosopher?
What do you mean?

26:52.375 --> 26:56.666
You're in exactly the same situation
I was in eight years ago, Willy.

26:56.750 --> 27:00.208
Except now I have a beautiful home
and a wonderful family...

27:02.041 --> 27:03.625
and I'm a respectable person.

27:08.250 --> 27:11.583
I'm not married, I don't have kids,
and I live on my own in a dump.

27:14.083 --> 27:18.000
Well, fewer expenses. You'll save money.

27:19.458 --> 27:23.291
When the firm went bankrupt,
I did a series of short-term jobs.

27:24.041 --> 27:25.250
Short-term jobs?

27:27.291 --> 27:30.166
They're not called short-term jobs.
They're shit-term jobs.

27:31.875 --> 27:37.833
Crap jobs.
Unlike this one, where we take no crap.

27:40.416 --> 27:41.291
This is how it works...

27:45.750 --> 27:48.458
There are three stages to this job.

27:48.666 --> 27:51.500
The first stage is finding them, okay?

27:52.041 --> 27:57.708
You trace them, you get past all
the filters, secretaries, assistants, etc.

27:58.333 --> 28:01.750
And then you pester them.
But really pester.

28:02.458 --> 28:06.000
-Don't they report you for stalking?
-We get reported all the time.

28:08.583 --> 28:11.041
Especially from people
in the second stage.

28:11.958 --> 28:13.666
What's stage two?

28:14.375 --> 28:17.333
-Make them ashamed.
-I'm not with you.

28:17.416 --> 28:21.458
It's obvious they're ashamed
to be in deb. I'm ashamed too.

28:21.833 --> 28:24.333
You'll understand better when I show you.

28:24.416 --> 28:26.833
I have to recover a debt
from one of these smart alecks.

28:27.458 --> 28:30.250
-May I?
-Thanks.

28:30.458 --> 28:32.000
No, I haven't finished.

28:32.083 --> 28:34.708
-It's only the crust.
-Get him another slice.

28:34.791 --> 28:38.041
-It's self-service in here.
-No, this is enough.

28:38.125 --> 28:41.250
I know it's self-service, but can't you...

28:44.333 --> 28:46.000
No, I'm sorry, I can't.

28:46.333 --> 28:48.291
If you make an exception for us...

28:49.250 --> 28:52.166
you can keep the change.
Get my friend a slice of pizza.

28:53.958 --> 28:55.083
Another cheese slice?

28:55.166 --> 28:58.208
-I said I was all set.
-What kind do you want, cheese?

28:59.666 --> 29:01.625
-I don't want any more.
-Well?

29:02.958 --> 29:03.958
Come on!

29:04.041 --> 29:06.041
-Cheese.
-Right, cheese.

29:13.125 --> 29:14.041
Why did you do that?

29:14.833 --> 29:18.958
Didn't you enjoy having power
over that girl for a moment?

29:19.041 --> 29:20.250
Be honest.

29:21.791 --> 29:25.666
-No, not one bit.
-Pity. It would have helped.

29:28.083 --> 29:29.083
I'm not like you.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.041
You're not like me...

29:39.166 --> 29:45.166
If the debtors still refuse to pay up,
you have to convince them some other way.

29:46.375 --> 29:48.333
-Understand?
-If they don't have the money?

29:49.125 --> 29:51.291
The dead don't have money, they do.

29:51.666 --> 29:54.000
I don't have any money,
but you beat me up.

29:54.291 --> 29:57.833
When I tell you they have the money,
you have to believe me.

29:58.083 --> 30:00.750
But there must be people
who are no longer--

30:00.833 --> 30:02.041
They're not people.

30:02.375 --> 30:03.458
They're called "debtors."

30:05.541 --> 30:07.541
I'll introduce you
to the poor wretches later.

30:07.833 --> 30:10.333
But these are crafty ones, okay?

30:11.708 --> 30:15.416
These have blood in them,
and we have to get it out, okay?

30:17.875 --> 30:20.875
Here's your pizza. Nice!

30:21.875 --> 30:22.833
Thanks. Where's my change?

30:24.625 --> 30:27.041
-But you told me I--
-What'd I say?

30:27.458 --> 30:29.500
The pizza costs a few euros at most.

30:31.083 --> 30:35.000
-Do you want an 18-euro tip?
-No, here's your change.

30:35.708 --> 30:40.750
I'm teasing. I said you could keep
the change. Thanks a lot.

30:40.833 --> 30:42.041
A couple of napkins.

30:43.375 --> 30:46.000
If you can,
fetch me a couple of paper napkins.

30:51.083 --> 30:52.041
Here we are.

30:52.250 --> 30:53.500
-Here.
-Thanks a lot.

30:54.708 --> 30:55.541
Here you are.

30:56.458 --> 30:59.708
Come on, it'll go cold. Eat your pizza.
She's pretty.

30:59.791 --> 31:01.750
-I'm not hungry anymore.
-You're not hungry?

31:03.041 --> 31:04.458
Okay, I'll eat it.

31:19.666 --> 31:20.750
We'll have some fun.

31:26.250 --> 31:27.625
Let's get down to business.

31:29.916 --> 31:31.916
And he's the one who should be ashamed?

31:39.083 --> 31:42.833
The engineer will leave through that door.
Know how I know?

31:43.708 --> 31:47.625
-You've been studying him.
-Well done, Willy. Well done.

31:47.708 --> 31:49.291
He's meeting the councilor.

31:49.708 --> 31:54.125
They're going out to lunch at 1:30,
at that restaurant.

31:58.291 --> 31:59.208
Here they are now.

32:01.125 --> 32:04.291
Follow me.
Nice and calm. Nice and calm, Willy.

32:23.041 --> 32:27.208
-Mr. Caprera!
-Leave us alone.

32:27.291 --> 32:30.166
Of course I'll leave you alone.

32:31.125 --> 32:36.625
But not before... you pay off your debt
to my client's company--

32:36.708 --> 32:40.666
-I don't know you! Go away!
-For 95,000 euros...

32:41.208 --> 32:43.291
borrowed in June 2013.

32:43.375 --> 32:44.833
-Know him?
-Never seen him before.

32:44.916 --> 32:47.000
That's not true.

32:48.083 --> 32:51.041
Mr. Caprera,
I've been to see you three times!

32:51.125 --> 32:53.708
We can't make it.
We'll call you another time.

32:53.791 --> 32:55.958
-And we spoke...
-We'll call you.

32:56.041 --> 33:01.333
...about this outstanding debt
Mr. Caprera still hasn't paid.

33:01.416 --> 33:07.666
This 95,000 euro debt.
This loan was taken out in 2013!

33:08.375 --> 33:11.458
-Mr. Caprera!
-Bastard! Stop following me!

33:11.875 --> 33:18.875
I'll stop following you, but not before
you pay off the debt you owe my client--

33:18.958 --> 33:20.958
If you don't stop, I'll call the police!

33:21.041 --> 33:23.500
Of course.
We aren't doing anything illegal.

33:23.916 --> 33:27.125
I will be happy to talk
to the police force

33:27.208 --> 33:31.166
about your outstanding debt
with my client's company--

33:31.250 --> 33:33.958
-Go to hell!
-Since June 2013!

33:35.333 --> 33:36.333
Mr. Caprera!

33:37.458 --> 33:43.666
You've owed this debt since June 2013,
to my client's company,

33:44.000 --> 33:46.625
a total of 95,000 euros!

33:52.041 --> 33:52.875
Mr. Caprera!

34:06.291 --> 34:07.208
Hold this a sec.

34:12.166 --> 34:13.791
-Do you smoke?
-Yes.

34:16.500 --> 34:17.333
There we go.

34:24.208 --> 34:25.041
Now what?

34:27.500 --> 34:32.250
Now... we have to let him think
he's shaken us off.

34:37.375 --> 34:38.291
What do you think?

34:40.333 --> 34:42.541
It's crazy. You're pillorying him.

34:42.625 --> 34:46.708
Pillorying? What do you mean?
I'm shaming him.

34:47.708 --> 34:50.708
-Does it work?
-More than you can imagine.

34:52.083 --> 34:56.333
-You didn't do that to me, though.
-So what? You're a poor wretch, Willy.

34:57.666 --> 34:58.666
It's different.

35:07.708 --> 35:08.833
Come on, let's go in.

35:11.750 --> 35:14.666
Are you coming?
Get rid of that cigarette.

35:23.875 --> 35:25.375
Sit down where I tell you.

35:30.666 --> 35:32.875
May I? Thank you.

35:36.750 --> 35:39.375
Mr. Caprera, I'm here to remind you

35:39.458 --> 35:45.125
-of your outstanding debt with--
-Please! Do you want to ruin me?

35:45.208 --> 35:47.625
Do I want to ruin you?
You're joking, aren't you?

35:47.708 --> 35:50.208
Please, I'm waiting
for an important person.

35:50.291 --> 35:54.875
Mr. Caprera, I am here to remind you
of your debt. Here's the councilor now.

35:55.291 --> 35:58.833
What do I do?
Stay here or leave you alone?

36:00.125 --> 36:02.500
We'll talk. We'll talk about it. Now go!

36:07.666 --> 36:09.708
-Mr. Caprera, hello.
-Mr. Cherubini, how are you?

36:09.791 --> 36:11.375
-Fine, and you?
-Everything's fine.

36:12.125 --> 36:13.750
-Please, have a seat.
-Thank you.

36:16.541 --> 36:18.541
-I'll be right with you.
-Good.

36:22.416 --> 36:25.333
Okay, come to my office tomorrow morning,

36:25.625 --> 36:28.458
and we'll discuss
how I'm going to pay off the debt.

36:33.291 --> 36:34.291
You have my word.

36:37.791 --> 36:38.750
Your word!

36:40.458 --> 36:46.375
What do you reckon, Willy...
can we accept the word of a debtor?

36:52.500 --> 36:54.750
It's the last thing a debtor has left,
his word.

36:54.833 --> 36:58.458
He would be stupid
to risk that too, right?

37:02.208 --> 37:03.250
It would be stupid.

37:07.583 --> 37:08.416
Let's go.

37:19.666 --> 37:21.625
It's not too late to change your mind.

37:25.875 --> 37:27.000
This is one step further, Guido.

37:29.958 --> 37:30.791
Do you understand?

37:33.625 --> 37:38.041
-You're not convinced.
-I am convinced, I told you. I'll do it.

37:39.208 --> 37:41.750
I'll do it. I'll do it!

37:45.875 --> 37:50.958
-Give me that thing. Give me that thing!
-It's not a game!

37:52.208 --> 37:53.250
It's not a game, Guido.

37:55.750 --> 37:56.625
Here.

37:58.708 --> 38:00.791
Hide it behind your back, understand?

38:03.291 --> 38:06.750
Approach him with your head down.
Keep your head down.

38:07.625 --> 38:10.958
Then you ask, "Got a light?"
or something like that.

38:12.375 --> 38:13.500
Then you know what you have to do.

38:17.208 --> 38:21.333
He's turned the light off.
He's coming out. Do you feel up to it?

38:27.208 --> 38:29.625
Go on. Go on, go on!

38:37.875 --> 38:38.916
Got a light?

38:47.875 --> 38:49.250
Remember your debt.

38:54.416 --> 38:55.416
Come on, come on!

38:58.541 --> 39:02.500
Fuck, you did it! You really did it.

39:03.166 --> 39:06.208
-What the fuck have I done?
-Fucking hell!

39:10.000 --> 39:11.208
Fuck, you were spot on!

39:11.916 --> 39:14.666
A neat, accurate job. you were amazing!

39:15.583 --> 39:18.541
No, I wasn't. I wasn't.

39:27.333 --> 39:29.250
All right, all right!

39:32.500 --> 39:33.958
Let's go and celebrate.

39:34.041 --> 39:36.208
-We'll buy a nice bottle.
-Pull over, let me out.

39:36.291 --> 39:41.125
-Let you out? What do you mean?
-I want to get out. Stop.

39:41.208 --> 39:45.208
-Let me out!
-Fuck you! Get out then!

39:47.708 --> 39:50.708
Where the fuck are you going?

39:54.083 --> 39:54.958
What an asshole!

40:02.958 --> 40:05.416
Come on, you did a great job.

40:05.500 --> 40:07.458
Leave me here. I'll see you tomorrow.

40:17.416 --> 40:18.416
Guido!

40:36.708 --> 40:37.541
Hi!

40:39.875 --> 40:41.666
-Hi.
-I'll buy you a coffee.

40:42.041 --> 40:43.916
-Normal?
-Yes.

40:46.125 --> 40:47.708
-Good evening.
-Hi.

40:50.958 --> 40:54.416
-Let's sit.
-I'm in a hurry. I just wanted a word.

40:56.291 --> 41:01.375
-How's your mother?
-The usual aches and pains.

41:03.375 --> 41:07.000
Listen, Guido, you're four months behind.

41:08.125 --> 41:12.291
-Here's your coffee.
-Perfect. Thanks.

41:13.875 --> 41:15.333
-Sugar.
-Thanks.

41:16.416 --> 41:18.291
I'm going outside to smoke.

41:18.375 --> 41:19.916
-If you need anything...
-Thanks.

41:24.666 --> 41:27.458
I haven't raised rent
like everyone else has.

41:27.541 --> 41:29.625
But I rely on that money.

41:46.291 --> 41:50.333
I've found another job.
Give me more time. I'll pay.

41:50.416 --> 41:51.708
I'll give you two weeks.

41:51.791 --> 41:54.625
Please give me a bit longer.
I swear I'll pay you.

41:55.458 --> 41:56.375
Really.

42:17.375 --> 42:18.291
Goodbye.

42:32.208 --> 42:35.291
-Here you are.
-No, thanks. I'm broke.

42:35.375 --> 42:36.791
It's on the house.

42:39.333 --> 42:41.875
Viktor called. He's not coming back yet.

42:44.750 --> 42:47.500
-Sorry to hear that.
-You're sorry?

42:49.125 --> 42:49.958
Okay.

42:52.625 --> 42:56.583
I have to call my sister...
and tell her I can't leave yet.

42:57.916 --> 42:58.750
You have a sister?

43:02.208 --> 43:04.041
I want to live in Hamburg with her.

43:07.791 --> 43:11.666
-All the people I know want to leave here.
-Why, don't you want to?

43:14.333 --> 43:17.291
-No, it's the same to me.
-Don't you have anyone?

43:20.291 --> 43:22.833
-Who? No.
-I don't know...

43:24.416 --> 43:27.083
A wife, a child, a cat.

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
The professor.

43:32.125 --> 43:36.250
-Who's the professor?
-A friend, a neighbor.

43:36.875 --> 43:39.500
-Does he come to the bar?
-No.

43:40.666 --> 43:42.791
He hasn't set foot in here
since they removed the snooker table.

43:46.500 --> 43:51.625
-And you're fond of the professor?
-Yes. He's totally crazy.

43:53.041 --> 43:55.833
-The professor doesn't count.
-What do you mean?

44:04.083 --> 44:04.916
Then no.

44:09.666 --> 44:10.750
I don't have anyone.

44:23.208 --> 44:24.416
Do you really want to leave?

44:27.875 --> 44:29.458
Why should I stay?

44:34.208 --> 44:35.958
I don't feel at home in Italy.

44:40.458 --> 44:44.416
And the people are resigned and sad.

44:45.500 --> 44:47.333
And I don't want to become sad too.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
Go on! Go on!

44:55.291 --> 44:56.250
Go on, go on!

45:02.083 --> 45:05.291
-Mr. Fantinari.
-Yes, that's right. Who are you?

45:06.291 --> 45:11.833
I'm here to remind you of your debt
of 80,000 euros that you owe my client.

45:13.791 --> 45:18.583
-How do you intend to pay it off?
-I don't have debts, I take out loans.

45:19.125 --> 45:22.916
I have a business to run.
I keep an eye on my loans.

45:23.000 --> 45:27.291
If you don't leave me alone, I'll call
my lawyers, and they'll bust your ass.

45:28.666 --> 45:32.708
I have an appointment now,
because I have a real job. Is that clear?

45:37.250 --> 45:38.291
What the fuck are you doing?

45:42.500 --> 45:43.416
Are you letting him go?

45:45.125 --> 45:49.750
-What do I do?
-You messed up. Come on.

45:50.041 --> 45:53.875
Mr. Fantinari, you can hide
as much as you want, but I'll find you.

45:54.208 --> 45:55.916
And if you don't intend to pay,

45:56.000 --> 45:59.708
my client will get the money back
one way or another.

45:59.791 --> 46:05.083
No, aim for my weak spot.
More determined! Start again!

46:07.375 --> 46:08.916
A man can't change his face.

46:09.791 --> 46:12.125
You're like those working-class paupers

46:12.208 --> 46:16.208
who buy a nice new suit believing they've
covered the stink, but they haven't.

46:16.833 --> 46:20.375
It's written all over their faces
that they're poor wretches...

46:21.000 --> 46:21.958
Mr. Fantinari.

46:24.708 --> 46:25.625
That's better.

46:26.083 --> 46:28.666
-Franco, here are your beers.
-Thanks, Fabrizio.

46:31.333 --> 46:34.333
What are you looking at?

46:35.166 --> 46:39.208
This is no place for poor wretches
like you. Do it again!

46:39.416 --> 46:42.958
Let me hear it more determined.
I want to see bloodshot eyes!

46:43.291 --> 46:44.916
-Mr. Fantinari!
-Louder!

46:45.125 --> 46:46.750
-Mr. Fantinari!
-Come on!

46:46.833 --> 46:48.125
Mr. Fantinari!

46:48.458 --> 46:51.375
-Mr. Fantinari!
-Not again!

46:53.291 --> 46:55.166
I'm here to allow you to pay off

46:55.250 --> 46:57.916
-your debt of 80,000 euros...
-I don't believe it!

46:58.000 --> 47:02.375
...that you borrowed from my client
in July 2010!

47:03.166 --> 47:04.500
-Who are these guys?
-Who are they?

47:06.125 --> 47:07.583
Madmen! A couple of madmen!

47:08.916 --> 47:10.541
They've been pestering me all day.

47:11.500 --> 47:15.791
I told you, they're madmen!
A pair of clowns, in fact.

47:16.416 --> 47:17.625
Guys, I've had enough for today.

47:19.041 --> 47:25.750
We want Mr. Fantinari
to settle the debt of 80,000 euros

47:25.833 --> 47:30.500
he borrowed from my client in July 2010.

47:32.375 --> 47:36.083
So, Mr. Fantinari,
how do you intend to settle--

47:36.625 --> 47:39.041
Listen, you've gone too far now!

47:44.041 --> 47:45.000
What the fuck?

47:45.083 --> 47:47.666
There's worse. They usually punch you.

47:47.750 --> 47:50.625
-Go after him!
-Mr. Fantinari!

47:52.958 --> 47:57.333
How do you intend
to settle your debt of 80,000 euros...?

47:57.416 --> 47:58.375
Forgive us, gentlemen.

48:00.958 --> 48:01.958
My regards.

48:04.166 --> 48:05.875
You can't walk on the green.

48:08.708 --> 48:09.541
Yes.

48:43.708 --> 48:45.833
-Hi, Ernesto.
-Good morning.

48:48.333 --> 48:50.916
-What are you doing?
-Cutting the hedge.

48:52.416 --> 48:56.125
I've been here since this morning.
I'll get some help next time.

48:57.458 --> 48:58.666
Mr. Fantinari!

48:59.916 --> 49:06.083
I'm here to remind you about the loan
you took out with my client in July 2010.

49:07.541 --> 49:08.666
Not here too!

49:12.291 --> 49:14.458
Enough! This is my home!

49:15.458 --> 49:16.916
It's private property!

49:17.000 --> 49:19.583
-Public sidewalk.
-I don't give a damn!

49:19.666 --> 49:22.666
It's my home! It's private property!

49:22.750 --> 49:24.916
-What's going on?
-Paola...

49:25.833 --> 49:30.291
Your husband takes out loans and doesn't
pay them back. Eighty thousand euros.

49:30.375 --> 49:33.541
Did you know your husband was insolvent?

49:33.625 --> 49:35.416
-Who are they?
-Let's go inside.

49:35.500 --> 49:36.500
What do they want?

49:39.083 --> 49:43.500
Don't you see it's the bank
that owes me money? Not me who owes them.

49:43.583 --> 49:47.500
We're not from the bank. Give me money.

49:47.875 --> 49:51.125
-Let's go inside.
-No, I want to know what they want.

49:53.625 --> 49:55.916
It's okay.

50:01.541 --> 50:03.666
Is this enough to pay your kid's keep
for a few days?

50:08.958 --> 50:09.833
Here, champ.

50:15.458 --> 50:16.458
We'll take care of you.

50:25.833 --> 50:26.666
Okay...

50:37.750 --> 50:38.583
Okay...

50:42.708 --> 50:43.708
Let's go!

50:46.125 --> 50:48.875
Outstanding! You were amazing!

50:49.708 --> 50:52.458
-You were amazing! I'm speechless.
-Then drive.

50:55.833 --> 50:59.916
If we don't stop, celebrate,
and have a drink, I'll abandon you here.

51:00.458 --> 51:01.291
Got that?

51:02.625 --> 51:05.875
You can go to Fantinari's for dinner.
They'll welcome you with open arms.

51:09.875 --> 51:12.625
-You're such a bastard!
-Aren't you?

51:15.416 --> 51:16.250
It would seem so.

51:20.375 --> 51:21.208
Nice, eh?

51:24.208 --> 51:26.291
Where are you going, girls?

51:26.375 --> 51:27.958
Hi. Good evening.

51:28.208 --> 51:30.291
-Where are you going?
-Inside.

51:30.375 --> 51:31.791
What's your name?

51:31.875 --> 51:33.416
-Ilda.
-Ilda?

51:33.500 --> 51:34.500
Let's go.

51:37.000 --> 51:38.708
-We have to go.
-Let's get a drink.

51:38.791 --> 51:41.541
-No, they're waiting inside.
-Who?

51:41.625 --> 51:43.916
-Our boyfriends.
-Your boyfriends?

51:45.166 --> 51:48.666
-You have no taste in men.
-Bye. Have a nice evening.

51:48.791 --> 51:51.708
You have a nice evening too.
Bye, Ilda!

51:54.666 --> 51:57.666
Pretty, eh? You're having fun!

51:57.750 --> 52:00.416
-You're having fun.
-I'm having fun?

52:00.500 --> 52:04.500
You're not a shit. You're a little shit.

52:04.916 --> 52:06.041
A little shit...

52:09.500 --> 52:10.750
Want some real fun?

52:12.750 --> 52:15.250
-Yes.
-Come on!

52:19.791 --> 52:21.458
Go screw yourself!

52:21.541 --> 52:22.458
Fuck off!

52:24.166 --> 52:29.166
Bruno, you've unloaded pallet A3
into the wrong storeroom! I did tell you!

52:35.083 --> 52:39.083
Renè, quit buzzing round that cage.
Get a move on, please!

52:41.000 --> 52:41.875
Move it!

52:44.291 --> 52:46.750
How long did you stick it out
with this swine?

52:46.833 --> 52:47.666
Too long.

52:49.458 --> 52:51.291
Did he treat you like that too?

52:56.666 --> 52:57.750
Wait a sec.

53:15.833 --> 53:21.291
Are you afraid to dirty your hands?
Come on, hurry up.

53:24.375 --> 53:29.416
What the fuck are you doing?
Guido, put me down, please!

53:30.791 --> 53:31.625
Guido!

53:34.750 --> 53:38.250
Stop fucking laughing! Put me down! Guido!

53:39.625 --> 53:40.875
Guido, fuck!

53:43.000 --> 53:44.833
Guido! Don't...

53:45.291 --> 53:47.333
Guido, put me down!

53:49.583 --> 53:52.583
You were right, boss,
I'm not cut out for this job.

53:54.708 --> 53:55.583
Guido!

54:06.041 --> 54:08.791
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

54:09.458 --> 54:12.291
Tell me, my son, how have you sinned?

54:19.833 --> 54:22.666
I have argued with my wife
a couple of times.

54:24.125 --> 54:29.666
-In front of the children?
-No! Never in front of the kids.

54:31.083 --> 54:32.083
Anything else?

54:38.041 --> 54:42.583
I stole a newspaper from a rest stop.
I don't even know why.

54:44.208 --> 54:46.375
Yes. What else?

54:55.875 --> 54:57.875
I treated a waitress badly.

55:01.375 --> 55:03.875
-Did you lose your temper?
-No.

55:06.291 --> 55:11.500
I enjoyed it. I didn't feel guilty.

55:13.083 --> 55:17.833
The fact that you're telling me now
means you do feel guilty.

55:19.208 --> 55:20.208
Nothing else?

55:22.000 --> 55:23.000
Not that I remember.

55:25.083 --> 55:31.208
If you forgive yourself, God too, through
his humble servant, will forgive you.

55:32.916 --> 55:35.583
For penance, say one Our Father.

56:23.666 --> 56:25.166
Got a light, please?

56:28.916 --> 56:30.500
Remember to pay your debts.

57:07.916 --> 57:09.791
-Go on, take it.
-No.

57:09.875 --> 57:11.541
I know you need it.

57:13.416 --> 57:14.416
Come on!

57:21.458 --> 57:22.458
Thanks.

57:27.041 --> 57:28.833
-See you tomorrow.
-Bye.

57:31.750 --> 57:36.166
Show more respect! That's enough!

57:36.250 --> 57:38.958
-Hey!
-Don't touch it!

57:40.083 --> 57:44.833
-Leave me alone, boys.
-Professor, come with me. Leave him alone.

57:46.208 --> 57:48.083
Look who's here!

57:50.208 --> 57:55.041
You're coming up in the world.
You've forgotten your old friend.

57:55.125 --> 57:59.000
I haven't. It's just...
things are a little complicated right now.

58:00.458 --> 58:03.958
-Did you win today, Professor?
-Why, do I usually lose?

58:05.500 --> 58:07.708
Thanks for the loan.
I can pay you back now.

58:08.583 --> 58:09.583
What's this?

58:10.583 --> 58:14.750
-Can't you accept a gift from a friend?
-I prefer to pay you back.

58:17.541 --> 58:20.958
Have you changed? Guido?

58:22.291 --> 58:23.291
Professor...

58:29.125 --> 58:33.291
-Come on, come inside.
-Some other time, Professor.

58:33.833 --> 58:37.041
-Here!
-What's wrong, Guido?

58:39.250 --> 58:43.750
-How's work going?
-The warehouse job is fine.

58:44.666 --> 58:48.208
Guido, why are you telling lies?

58:52.250 --> 58:55.125
Last night, I finally realized
how you can do it.

58:57.166 --> 58:58.000
How you can do what?

58:58.416 --> 59:02.416
Be inside! The system, obviously!

59:03.916 --> 59:09.791
To be inside the system... you have
to have a bit of the system inside you.

59:11.000 --> 59:12.458
It's the only way.

59:13.208 --> 59:16.958
Otherwise, they're just clumsy attempts.

59:49.208 --> 59:50.916
-Hi.
-Hi.

59:51.250 --> 59:52.375
Let's go somewhere.

59:53.416 --> 59:54.625
We're in a good mood tonight.

59:54.708 --> 59:56.750
-Come on! Have you eaten?
-No.

59:57.083 --> 59:58.125
I'll buy you dinner.

59:58.208 --> 59:59.416
-Now?
-Yes, now.

59:59.500 --> 01:00:00.791
I can't. How can I?

01:00:07.041 --> 01:00:07.916
What are you doing?

01:00:10.416 --> 01:00:15.166
-Excuse me. We're about to close.
-Is it 2:00 already?

01:00:15.250 --> 01:00:18.583
-It's past 2:00.
-I'll be off, then.

01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:23.125
Fuck.

01:00:32.291 --> 01:00:34.250
-There's no one left.
-No.

01:00:34.791 --> 01:00:37.958
Let's go. I'll close the shutters.

01:00:52.750 --> 01:00:54.625
-Let's go.
-Coming.

01:00:56.875 --> 01:00:57.708
Thanks.

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:07.875
-We're eating here?
-Of course. Come on.

01:01:25.875 --> 01:01:28.750
-Pick a table.
-Over there.

01:01:41.333 --> 01:01:43.083
-Isn't it nice?
-Yes.

01:01:50.625 --> 01:01:52.416
I closed early today.

01:01:54.791 --> 01:01:57.458
Viktor deserves it
for postponing his return again.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.875
-Yes.
-So you'll be staying longer?

01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:06.500
-Do you mind?
-Very.

01:02:08.375 --> 01:02:09.541
Sorry, the kitchen is closed.

01:02:09.625 --> 01:02:11.666
-No! How come?
-I'm sorry.

01:02:13.583 --> 01:02:15.083
All right.

01:02:15.166 --> 01:02:17.583
Look, I wanted to bring this young lady
to a nice place.

01:02:17.666 --> 01:02:19.291
Something simple will do.

01:02:19.375 --> 01:02:23.041
-We're closed. I'm sorry.
-It's all right. Let's go.

01:02:23.125 --> 01:02:25.166
-Even something cold will do.
-I can't. I'm sorry.

01:02:25.250 --> 01:02:26.750
There's a pizzeria nearby.

01:02:26.833 --> 01:02:29.916
A pizzeria? We don't want a pizzeria.

01:02:30.125 --> 01:02:34.583
-Guido, that's enough. Let's go.
-Okay, I get it.

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:41.791
-Sir, you're embarrassing me.
-Don't be silly.

01:02:41.875 --> 01:02:44.875
You're the waiter. Take this money,
and bring us something to eat.

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:48.500
What are you doing?

01:02:55.708 --> 01:02:56.541
Rina.

01:03:07.666 --> 01:03:09.750
-Where are you going?
-I'm seeing you in.

01:03:52.666 --> 01:03:56.875
-Want to have a drink?
-The bar's closed.

01:03:58.125 --> 01:04:02.958
-Come on, just one.
-What's this? Offering me a tip, too?

01:04:50.250 --> 01:04:54.833
-Can't we take these off?
-Take them off? No.

01:04:57.166 --> 01:04:58.000
Why not?

01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:01.416
Because we look scarier like this.

01:05:09.416 --> 01:05:11.625
So, which do you prefer?

01:05:12.875 --> 01:05:16.125
-Metallic gray or red?
-I don't know.

01:05:16.541 --> 01:05:18.083
You must have a preference.

01:05:22.833 --> 01:05:25.541
-Metallic gray.
-Metallic gray?

01:05:26.791 --> 01:05:31.125
You've no fucking idea about cars.
Red's better. No?

01:05:32.916 --> 01:05:36.000
-Here he is.
-What do we do?

01:05:36.625 --> 01:05:40.958
What we do is...
wave and smile, okay?

01:05:54.708 --> 01:05:56.041
See how scary we are?

01:06:08.875 --> 01:06:09.875
Red's better, isn't it?

01:06:16.583 --> 01:06:22.000
-Are you sure it's him?
-The file says "fish farm."

01:06:25.375 --> 01:06:26.375
How much does he owe?

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.875
How much? Too much for him.

01:06:35.958 --> 01:06:37.291
What if the bank's got it wrong?

01:06:40.916 --> 01:06:42.208
You know what?

01:06:44.708 --> 01:06:46.375
Fuck the fish!

01:07:02.291 --> 01:07:03.208
Fancy a game?

01:07:10.708 --> 01:07:14.333
Are you any good? I bet you played
with dolls when you were a kid.

01:07:15.083 --> 01:07:16.375
Or hopscotch, eh?

01:07:19.791 --> 01:07:24.625
The first to score wins. Shall we play
for who buys lunch? Are you ready?

01:07:39.166 --> 01:07:40.000
What the fuck!

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.541
No, that's cheating!

01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:47.791
<i>You can pay this time.</i>

01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:50.416
<i>I haven't seen you in ages.</i>

01:08:52.582 --> 01:08:54.000
<i>I've been very busy.</i>

01:08:54.750 --> 01:08:58.375
<i>You're a liar.</i>
<i>You won't get away with it that easily.</i>

01:09:00.291 --> 01:09:01.375
<i>I never lie.</i>

01:09:05.625 --> 01:09:07.500
<i>Who was that girl I saw?</i>

01:09:09.707 --> 01:09:10.541
<i>What girl?</i>

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:17.582
<i>Don't act smart with me.</i>
<i>I saw her leave here the other day.</i>

01:09:19.166 --> 01:09:20.166
<i>Who was she?</i>

01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:23.832
<i>-An old friend.</i>
<i>-Really?</i>

01:09:27.416 --> 01:09:29.250
<i>What was she doing here at that hour?</i>

01:09:30.707 --> 01:09:32.125
<i>It's none of your business.</i>

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.707
<i>Go back in there. I have work to do.</i>

01:09:39.291 --> 01:09:40.500
<i>I certainly won't!</i>

01:09:41.791 --> 01:09:45.457
You merely have to say your bank
has nothing to do with their debts now.

01:09:46.416 --> 01:09:47.916
They can come and complain to us.

01:09:49.375 --> 01:09:53.541
All right.
But, of course, I'll check it myself.

01:09:54.291 --> 01:09:56.958
Goodbye, sir. Goodbye.

01:09:59.666 --> 01:10:03.166
Hear that? They act like saints
because someone complains.

01:10:04.333 --> 01:10:08.166
But when we buy debts off them,
they keep quiet.

01:10:09.666 --> 01:10:14.666
Listen, put a bit of pressure
on our lady friend next time.

01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:15.750
It will be a pleasure.

01:10:16.791 --> 01:10:18.000
Tell me about the new guy.

01:10:18.083 --> 01:10:20.250
-Rabaglia, right?
-Yes.

01:10:20.333 --> 01:10:24.208
-What's he like?
-He's good. He's really good.

01:10:24.666 --> 01:10:26.000
-Guido.
-Hi.

01:10:27.458 --> 01:10:28.541
Welcome.

01:10:28.625 --> 01:10:31.125
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

01:10:32.166 --> 01:10:33.375
It's nice here.

01:10:33.458 --> 01:10:37.958
Yes, it's one of the best areas in Rome.
The air's clean. It's behind the cemetery.

01:10:39.583 --> 01:10:41.541
We don't discuss work at home.

01:10:42.625 --> 01:10:43.500
Put that here.

01:10:43.833 --> 01:10:44.666
Darling!

01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:47.375
Hi.

01:10:47.916 --> 01:10:50.541
-This is Guido!
-Guido, at last!

01:10:50.791 --> 01:10:51.625
Nice to meet you.

01:10:51.708 --> 01:10:54.250
Dorota. Franco talks about you
all the time.

01:10:54.333 --> 01:10:56.000
Oh, please.

01:10:56.458 --> 01:10:58.458
-Look what he's brought.
-Thank you.

01:10:59.208 --> 01:11:00.833
-Give it to me!
-Kids!

01:11:00.916 --> 01:11:02.916
Kids, come and say hello to Guido.

01:11:04.666 --> 01:11:05.666
Kids!

01:11:07.125 --> 01:11:08.541
Want some wine?

01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:10.333
-Yes, please.
-Of course.

01:11:11.875 --> 01:11:14.375
-Thanks.
-Here we are.

01:11:14.458 --> 01:11:15.833
-Do you have kids?
-No.

01:11:16.041 --> 01:11:17.500
-Are you married?
-No.

01:11:17.583 --> 01:11:20.708
-She'll ask for your fingerprints next.
-Sorry.

01:11:20.791 --> 01:11:24.666
-Come on, kids.
-Just a sec.

01:11:24.750 --> 01:11:27.125
-Can we play after dinner?
-Of course.

01:11:27.958 --> 01:11:29.166
After you've done your homework.

01:11:29.250 --> 01:11:30.666
-I've done mine.
-So have I.

01:11:30.750 --> 01:11:33.250
-No, you haven't.
-Cheers!

01:11:34.958 --> 01:11:35.791
Thanks.

01:11:43.875 --> 01:11:46.666
-You have a lovely family, you know.
-Thanks.

01:11:48.708 --> 01:11:52.500
I wanted to thank you for today.
It's done me good.

01:11:53.791 --> 01:11:58.666
There's no need to thank me.
If you can't spend a day with friends...

01:12:03.416 --> 01:12:04.458
Because we are friends...

01:12:12.916 --> 01:12:14.041
I want to show you something.

01:12:32.166 --> 01:12:37.208
I wish to officially notify you...
that your debt has been paid off.

01:12:41.041 --> 01:12:46.458
Here. It wasn't easy.
I had to work hard at it, Willy.

01:12:48.083 --> 01:12:50.125
Your debt is with me now.

01:12:52.875 --> 01:12:54.083
I thought we were friends.

01:13:00.875 --> 01:13:01.875
Of course.

01:13:03.291 --> 01:13:05.166
He asked me to give you this too.

01:13:15.791 --> 01:13:18.875
Stay with us,
and this will be your monthly wage.

01:13:21.666 --> 01:13:23.791
You'll have to become self-sufficient.

01:13:24.958 --> 01:13:26.041
I'll take you to the bank tomorrow.

01:13:26.958 --> 01:13:28.875
-The bank?
-The bank.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.791
Where do you think we get
our debtors from?

01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:38.500
Do you accept?

01:15:00.333 --> 01:15:04.166
And this man owes us 50,000
for a debt run up in 2010,

01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:07.916
a construction company
that went bankrupt once.

01:15:08.791 --> 01:15:10.083
He's crafty, but he has the money.

01:15:12.250 --> 01:15:16.916
Four percent.
Let's hope the debt is real this time.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.666
Last time with Fantinari,
we got into a legal dispute.

01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:26.041
Okay, four percent. You're being trained
by one of the best in the field.

01:15:26.125 --> 01:15:27.000
I know.

01:15:29.333 --> 01:15:32.291
-He'll be teaching me the trade soon.
-Yeah, right.

01:15:37.666 --> 01:15:38.750
The total amount.

01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:47.708
-Can you give me Rinaldi's file?
-Rinaldi. Here it is.

01:15:49.041 --> 01:15:51.500
Is this where we're going?
Not to the ex-factory girl?

01:15:52.375 --> 01:15:53.208
No.

01:15:54.416 --> 01:15:55.666
We're going to Rinaldi's first.

01:15:57.791 --> 01:15:59.833
It's a case
I've been putting off for days.

01:16:01.375 --> 01:16:04.833
I thought you worked part-time
in a restaurant, Mr. Rinaldi?

01:16:05.208 --> 01:16:10.208
-I thought we'd be able to retain a fifth.
-They're already taking a fifth.

01:16:10.291 --> 01:16:12.541
-I see.
-I earn 600 euros a month,

01:16:12.750 --> 01:16:14.125
and they take off 120.

01:16:14.875 --> 01:16:18.625
And we have to live off 480 euros a month.
With two kids!

01:16:18.708 --> 01:16:20.291
Can't you see how we live?

01:16:20.416 --> 01:16:21.625
Don't you have any income?

01:16:21.708 --> 01:16:24.833
No, I lost my job two years ago,
and I haven't found another.

01:16:24.916 --> 01:16:26.250
-Any property?
-No.

01:16:26.333 --> 01:16:30.375
-A relative?
-Nothing! Nothing at all!

01:16:33.958 --> 01:16:38.250
Don't be like that, Mr. Rinaldi,
or you'll make me change my mind.

01:16:39.333 --> 01:16:41.416
What do you mean? I don't understand.

01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:50.083
I was thinking... of declaring...
your debit irrecoverable.

01:16:54.291 --> 01:16:56.166
Forgive me, what does that mean?

01:16:56.291 --> 01:16:59.166
That you will cancel our debt?

01:17:00.041 --> 01:17:03.791
I believe, considering your circumstances,
that you're unable to pay off

01:17:03.875 --> 01:17:05.875
even a part of your debt.

01:17:06.916 --> 01:17:12.250
Listen, I'm ashamed, you know.
I'm really ashamed...

01:17:12.333 --> 01:17:16.166
I don't care how ashamed you are,
Mr. Rinaldi.

01:17:17.083 --> 01:17:21.875
Though, not paying your debts
is something to be ashamed of.

01:17:21.958 --> 01:17:22.958
Yes...

01:17:29.333 --> 01:17:33.250
Well... I was expecting
a little gratitude, at least.

01:17:33.458 --> 01:17:34.500
Of course.

01:17:35.583 --> 01:17:41.458
I expected at least... that you treat me
and my colleague to a nice meal.

01:17:44.625 --> 01:17:48.416
And you...
how much do you need for a nice meal?

01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:51.250
One hundred euro?

01:17:55.208 --> 01:17:57.833
One hundred-fifty? Two hundred euro?

01:17:58.708 --> 01:18:03.000
Huh, Guido?
I reckon 200 euros will cover it.

01:18:04.750 --> 01:18:05.708
Let's make it 200.

01:18:29.250 --> 01:18:31.666
-Here.
-No, give it to my colleague.

01:18:42.083 --> 01:18:45.333
There. Is that not enough, Guido?

01:18:48.625 --> 01:18:53.208
If not, look around.
There might be something we can take.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:00.083
All right. Two hundred euros will do.

01:19:02.375 --> 01:19:03.541
But I want that too.

01:19:18.333 --> 01:19:19.333
Yes.

01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:26.708
No, you've got the wrong idea.

01:19:27.583 --> 01:19:30.416
I'll leave you the frame.
I want the photograph.

01:19:32.041 --> 01:19:33.333
The photograph?

01:19:33.541 --> 01:19:35.750
Yes, these are my terms
for writing off your debt.

01:19:37.833 --> 01:19:38.833
I want the photo.

01:19:41.041 --> 01:19:44.625
Because I want to keep... a picture...

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.708
of you... smiling.

01:19:57.416 --> 01:20:00.875
Turn around.
Tell me if they're at the window.

01:20:02.208 --> 01:20:04.458
Yes, they're clearly
looking out of the window.

01:20:18.833 --> 01:20:22.458
It costs me to write off their debt.
It has to cost them something, too.

01:20:33.208 --> 01:20:38.291
-And what do you do, Mrs. Lorace?
-I work for a cleaning company.

01:20:40.458 --> 01:20:42.833
You clean stairways in apartment blocks?

01:20:45.583 --> 01:20:50.625
I see. Here it says you live
with Mr. Sergio Listri.

01:20:51.541 --> 01:20:52.833
-Is that right?
-Yes.

01:20:53.791 --> 01:20:55.625
Do you contribute
to the household expenses?

01:20:56.583 --> 01:20:57.416
When I can.

01:21:00.458 --> 01:21:06.833
Because here it says your situation
is really... bad, disastrous, complex.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:08.875
What do you say, Guido?

01:21:10.625 --> 01:21:12.208
Well, Mrs. Lorace is...

01:21:13.541 --> 01:21:16.750
-having a hard time right now, maybe--
-Mrs. Lorace...

01:21:22.166 --> 01:21:28.333
your debt amounts to 15,800 euros...
with which you bought a car.

01:21:28.833 --> 01:21:34.666
-How are you going to pay off this debt?
-I don't know. I can't right now.

01:21:34.916 --> 01:21:39.416
-I needed the car for--
-I know, you needed the car.

01:21:40.458 --> 01:21:42.291
Everyone needs a car.

01:21:43.333 --> 01:21:47.833
But you have this relative...
Ilenia Lorace,

01:21:48.583 --> 01:21:51.416
who has an apartment in the Avellino area.

01:21:52.208 --> 01:21:53.416
My aunt has nothing to do with it.

01:21:54.041 --> 01:21:57.500
-You can't do that.
-No, you're wrong.

01:21:58.958 --> 01:22:00.250
I believe we can.

01:22:01.916 --> 01:22:05.250
She's the only relative
in the family estate.

01:22:05.583 --> 01:22:07.000
We can do that, can't we, Guido?

01:22:09.958 --> 01:22:11.000
Of course we can.

01:22:12.916 --> 01:22:15.125
Can you really lose a house
because of a car?

01:22:15.208 --> 01:22:17.083
Of course not, but she fell for it.

01:22:17.666 --> 01:22:22.291
-But you were saying...
-What? We scared her.

01:22:22.375 --> 01:22:23.416
She believed us.

01:22:24.625 --> 01:22:28.125
You once asked me
what the hardest part of this job was.

01:22:28.208 --> 01:22:30.708
This is it.
Don't let yourself get involved!

01:22:36.958 --> 01:22:40.500
This is a businessman
in telecommunications.

01:22:41.916 --> 01:22:44.208
He had a share in Edocom. Just imagine.

01:22:46.333 --> 01:22:49.541
He's only been in trouble for a few years,
but I'm sure he has money.

01:22:50.666 --> 01:22:52.875
We'll aim for a 60 percent settlement.

01:22:53.541 --> 01:22:56.833
-Mr. Paladini?
<i>-Yes?</i>

01:22:57.208 --> 01:22:59.375
We're from Cobufin.
We spoke on the phone this morning.

01:22:59.958 --> 01:23:01.000
<i>Third floor.</i>

01:24:11.708 --> 01:24:15.750
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

01:24:18.916 --> 01:24:20.583
Go back to bed. Be right there.

01:24:23.833 --> 01:24:24.916
Don't stay up late.

01:24:57.875 --> 01:24:58.875
I'm fine, yes...

01:25:35.166 --> 01:25:36.166
What's the matter?

01:25:37.375 --> 01:25:38.333
What's up?

01:25:44.041 --> 01:25:45.041
What's up?

01:25:51.416 --> 01:25:52.416
What's wrong?

01:25:55.916 --> 01:25:56.916
Guido?

01:26:01.083 --> 01:26:01.916
What's wrong?

01:26:03.333 --> 01:26:04.958
Will you tell me what happened?

01:26:07.958 --> 01:26:09.291
I've done some terrible things.

01:26:11.666 --> 01:26:13.333
What did you do that was so bad?

01:26:16.375 --> 01:26:18.750
Things... Wicked things.

01:26:20.333 --> 01:26:21.375
Really wicked things.

01:26:24.791 --> 01:26:25.791
Really wicked?

01:28:18.666 --> 01:28:24.791
Well? Isn't it fabulous? It's a real gem,
see? They didn't have it in red.

01:28:25.625 --> 01:28:29.041
I slept so well last night!
I feel full of energy, like a lion.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:40.166
-Where are we going?
-To persuade a guy who lives in my area.

01:28:41.958 --> 01:28:44.750
Fill your lungs! Breathe in!
Smell that fresh air!

01:28:50.250 --> 01:28:53.541
The other day, you were over there.
My house is behind there.

01:28:55.041 --> 01:28:56.375
Can you see that row of cypress trees?

01:28:57.666 --> 01:29:00.625
Look to the right,
to the roofs of those apartment blocks.

01:29:01.416 --> 01:29:04.583
In there. That's where my home is.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.125
-Guido!
-Professor!

01:29:13.708 --> 01:29:16.791
Do you know him? Who is he?

01:29:16.875 --> 01:29:20.291
-You father? Uncle? A friend?
-Yes, he's a friend.

01:29:21.958 --> 01:29:23.791
Get in the car. Leave it to me.

01:29:23.875 --> 01:29:26.333
-You mustn't touch him!
-I won't.

01:29:26.416 --> 01:29:29.708
-Wait in the car!
-What are you doing here, Guido?

01:29:29.791 --> 01:29:32.958
-Wait, there must be some mistake.
-What mistake?

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:38.541
The professor asked for a loan
to renovate his lovely home.

01:29:38.625 --> 01:29:42.375
And now he won't pay it back.
That's all, you see?

01:29:42.458 --> 01:29:46.500
-He hangs up when I phone him. Right?
-Now I know who you are. Hello.

01:29:46.583 --> 01:29:48.000
-Hello.
-There's a mistake.

01:29:48.083 --> 01:29:51.500
His house isn't lovely.
It's a dump like mine. Sorry.

01:29:51.583 --> 01:29:53.666
-That's all right.
-What did you do with your loan, then?

01:29:54.291 --> 01:29:58.958
Guido, will you explain?
What are you doing?

01:29:59.250 --> 01:30:01.666
-Are you with these corpse carriers?
-"Corpse carriers"?

01:30:01.750 --> 01:30:06.916
-Weren't you working at the warehouse?
-He doesn't work at the warehouse anymore.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.041
Listen to me a minute. Franco...

01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:12.333
What did he do with 20,000 euros?
I won't listen!

01:30:12.958 --> 01:30:19.416
-Where are the 20,000 euros?
-Do you know... you're really annoying?

01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:23.000
I am? I'm going to ruin you.
We're going to ruin you!

01:30:25.041 --> 01:30:27.458
I want you to tell me
what you did with the loan.

01:30:28.916 --> 01:30:30.625
My wife was ill.

01:30:31.916 --> 01:30:37.500
But it seems a bank considers it more
reasonable to invest money on flooring

01:30:37.583 --> 01:30:38.625
than pay for medical treatment.

01:30:38.916 --> 01:30:42.666
-What does it matter to you?
-It does matter! It matters a lot.

01:30:42.750 --> 01:30:44.083
I'm sorry to hear about your wife.

01:30:44.166 --> 01:30:47.458
I'll say an Our Father for her,
a Hail Mary,

01:30:47.791 --> 01:30:52.375
-but you have to pay up.
-Do you mind if I digress a moment?

01:30:52.708 --> 01:30:54.583
Towards the end of the 1400s,

01:30:54.666 --> 01:30:58.833
you would not have been allowed
to recite the Lord's Prayer.

01:30:59.250 --> 01:31:04.250
It was customary that creditors
could not pronounce the words

01:31:04.333 --> 01:31:08.333
"as we forgive our debtors"
without really doing so.

01:31:08.416 --> 01:31:12.500
He would have been considered a liar,
an impostor.

01:31:12.583 --> 01:31:14.750
-Please...
-A braggart!

01:31:14.833 --> 01:31:19.291
I mean no offense.
Just putting things straight.

01:31:19.375 --> 01:31:21.666
The position of things is important.

01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:24.500
-You know, in math, fractals...
-Professor, wait.

01:31:24.583 --> 01:31:26.333
Please, just a second...

01:31:26.416 --> 01:31:29.875
-What now?
-Can't you see he's just a crazy old man?

01:31:29.958 --> 01:31:33.541
-He politically analyzes snooker.
-You're pissing me off.

01:31:35.208 --> 01:31:39.083
-Pay us back! You have the money!
-I don't have the money!

01:31:39.166 --> 01:31:43.583
You do have money!
You have a pension of 640 euros!

01:31:43.666 --> 01:31:47.708
Now let's sit down
and see how we can go about it.

01:31:47.791 --> 01:31:52.875
Guido, tell him, please!
What can we do?

01:31:53.208 --> 01:31:56.166
I hope he's not offended by what I said.

01:31:56.416 --> 01:31:59.833
What do I do?
Where do you fit in with these people?

01:31:59.916 --> 01:32:01.833
Don't worry, professor.
I'll take care of it.

01:32:01.916 --> 01:32:04.708
How will I pay him out of 640 euros?

01:32:05.375 --> 01:32:10.666
-Is this your wife?
-No, you can't do that!

01:32:10.958 --> 01:32:13.541
-Guido! Leave it!
-Is this her?

01:32:13.625 --> 01:32:16.458
-Get off! What the fuck!
-What the fuck are you doing?

01:32:17.625 --> 01:32:21.208
-Here, go away. You're no longer in debt.
-No?

01:32:21.291 --> 01:32:25.791
-We've done it before. Free him too.
-How fucking dare you, you little shit!

01:32:25.875 --> 01:32:29.333
-Leave him alone now!
-No, stop! Take this paper!

01:32:29.416 --> 01:32:34.458
-I'll settle it!
-I don't want it. You can keep it.

01:32:35.041 --> 01:32:40.041
You're one of those people
who are worthless, who aren't worth shit.

01:32:40.125 --> 01:32:41.250
Keep that paper!

01:32:49.166 --> 01:32:53.375
You can go now. You're free!
But it costs me to write off debts!

01:32:54.416 --> 01:32:55.583
Fuck you, Guido.

01:32:56.666 --> 01:32:58.750
-Go home.
-Will you come too?

01:32:58.833 --> 01:33:00.416
-No, go home. We'll talk later.
-Please...

01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:04.250
-Professor! Go home!
-Come with me, Guido.

01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:16.333
Franco!

01:33:16.958 --> 01:33:18.291
Go away, or else...

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:29.041
Wait!

01:33:31.666 --> 01:33:35.666
I don't believe it!
I got you out of trouble.

01:33:37.166 --> 01:33:38.750
I taught you the trade.

01:33:40.541 --> 01:33:42.125
I offered you my friendship.

01:33:48.083 --> 01:33:49.666
Wait, damn it!

01:33:50.875 --> 01:33:52.458
I invited you to my home.

01:33:59.708 --> 01:34:00.708
Wait for me.

01:34:03.750 --> 01:34:06.250
I let you meet my kids!

01:34:11.250 --> 01:34:12.375
And he acts the hero.

01:34:12.875 --> 01:34:15.500
He writes off his friend's debt
and feels so kind.

01:34:15.958 --> 01:34:20.000
-What the fuck are you saying?
-You beat a man up just three days ago.

01:34:22.291 --> 01:34:26.416
And you were right to
because that's how the job works.

01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:29.750
-This isn't a job!
-What is it?

01:34:30.125 --> 01:34:34.000
A perversion, an anomaly, shit.
But it's not a job.

01:34:34.083 --> 01:34:37.791
-You didn't have qualms before.
-What do you know about my qualms?

01:34:38.625 --> 01:34:42.833
I know it didn't stop you
from humiliating a man before his son.

01:34:43.500 --> 01:34:45.875
And now you act so pure
because it's someone you know.

01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:51.458
He's a poor old man, a friend!
Are you such shit that you can't see that?

01:35:04.708 --> 01:35:08.458
Do you really think I don't want to write
your friend's debt off?

01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:15.000
Do you really think
I want to squeeze some money

01:35:15.083 --> 01:35:18.833
out of that pathetic old man who's dead?

01:35:24.583 --> 01:35:29.375
Because they're all dead in here.
They're all dead in here!

01:35:29.458 --> 01:35:34.375
Look at all these debtors! We buy them,
but they're dead, they're already dead!

01:35:34.458 --> 01:35:36.416
You and I are already dead!

01:35:42.750 --> 01:35:48.375
I've tried... but I can't do it.
I'm not like you.

01:35:49.750 --> 01:35:52.791
-You can say that again.
-You're pathetic.

01:35:53.250 --> 01:35:57.750
You convince yourself that they're crafty,
loaded with money. Pathetic.

01:35:59.625 --> 01:36:00.958
I don't give a damn.

01:36:02.041 --> 01:36:05.500
I do my job and go home composed,
be assured of that!

01:36:09.458 --> 01:36:11.041
I placed my trust in you.

01:36:15.708 --> 01:36:16.750
Go on.

01:36:24.583 --> 01:36:25.875
Fuck you, Willy!

01:37:09.041 --> 01:37:09.875
Viktor.

01:37:10.666 --> 01:37:11.625
Hey, Guido!

01:37:14.166 --> 01:37:18.583
-Where's Rina?
-Rina? On a plane. She flew out today.

01:37:19.208 --> 01:37:20.333
Sit down. Be right with you.

01:38:41.166 --> 01:38:42.958
Our Father, who art in Heaven,

01:38:43.666 --> 01:38:48.208
hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done,

01:38:48.916 --> 01:38:50.500
on Earth as it is in Heaven.

01:38:52.416 --> 01:38:54.583
Give us this day our daily bread

01:38:57.041 --> 01:39:02.583
and forgive us our debts
as we forgive our debtors.

01:39:03.875 --> 01:39:07.916
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil, amen.

01:39:14.083 --> 01:39:17.125
FORGIVE US OUR DEBTS
