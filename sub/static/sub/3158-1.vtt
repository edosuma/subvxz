02:13.960 --> 02:16.003
Alice Springs, last stop.

02:27.680 --> 02:31.919
'Dear Sir, I am planning to walk
across the Australian desert,

02:31.920 --> 02:35.879
from Alice Springs to the Indian
Ocean... a distance of 2,000 miles.'

02:40.760 --> 02:43.361
'The trip will take
six-to-seven months.'

02:44.280 --> 02:46.130
Dickheads.

02:50.600 --> 02:53.599
'I arrived in Alice
Springs over a year ago.

02:53.600 --> 02:57.599
There are herds of feral camels roaming
freely throughout Central Australia

02:57.600 --> 03:01.204
and my idea was to capture a few
and train them to carry my gear.'

03:10.160 --> 03:12.124
Diggity, stay.

03:15.040 --> 03:17.799
'The trip wasn't conceived
as an adventure,

03:17.800 --> 03:20.519
in the sense of something
to be proved or conquered.

03:20.520 --> 03:24.239
And when people ask me why I'm doing
it, my usual answer is "why not?".'

03:24.240 --> 03:26.159
I was wondering if
you had any work.

03:26.160 --> 03:29.639
- What kind of work?
- Behind the bar, anything.

03:29.640 --> 03:32.079
Ask the missus. She's out the back.

03:32.080 --> 03:33.919
Got a place to stay?

03:33.920 --> 03:36.599
I was planning on
camping somewhere.

03:36.600 --> 03:38.399
Got a tent?

03:38.400 --> 03:39.965
No.

03:43.240 --> 03:45.759
One meal per shift is provided,

03:45.760 --> 03:49.399
rent's deducted from first week's
pay, the loo's down the hall.

03:49.400 --> 03:51.170
Great. Thanks.

03:57.560 --> 03:59.569
I have a dog.

04:13.840 --> 04:16.879
'I'd always been drawn to
the purity of the desert,

04:16.880 --> 04:20.719
its hot wind and
wide, open spaces.'

04:20.720 --> 04:22.559
Alone?

04:22.560 --> 04:26.119
Yeah, well, I'll need to train
some camels to carry my gear

04:26.120 --> 04:29.130
and... then there's
Diggity, of course.

04:31.800 --> 04:35.159
You go right ahead, love.
Go right ahead.

04:35.160 --> 04:37.799
'But mainly I was bored
of life in the city,

04:37.800 --> 04:39.519
with its repetitions,

04:39.520 --> 04:42.199
my half-finished,
half-hearted attempts at jobs

04:42.200 --> 04:44.199
and various studies.'

04:47.320 --> 04:49.279
'And I was sick of carrying around

04:49.280 --> 04:52.159
the self-indulgent negativity
that was so much the malaise

04:52.160 --> 04:54.759
of my generation, my
sex and my class.'

04:54.760 --> 04:56.530
Come on!

05:04.920 --> 05:06.719
'The decision to act was in itself

05:06.720 --> 05:08.445
the beginning of the journey.

05:15.600 --> 05:18.119
I believe when you've been
stuck too long in one spot,

05:18.120 --> 05:19.759
it's best to throw a grenade

05:19.760 --> 05:21.759
where you're standing, and jump...

05:21.760 --> 05:23.564
and pray.'

05:36.600 --> 05:40.247
Hey. We are closed today.

05:41.280 --> 05:44.119
Your plan is ridiculous.

05:44.120 --> 05:46.839
My father crossed the
Kalahari in 1935...

05:46.840 --> 05:48.519
that wasn't so ridiculous.

05:48.520 --> 05:50.439
Nothing's in the blood.

05:50.440 --> 05:52.210
I'm a hard worker.

05:54.680 --> 06:00.399
You can work for me for
eight months... for free.

06:00.400 --> 06:02.639
I'll show you how to train them.

06:02.640 --> 06:06.799
After that, I give you...
two wild camels.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.879
And that will be that.

06:08.880 --> 06:11.959
So... do we sign a contract?

06:11.960 --> 06:13.924
I'm good to my word.

06:17.640 --> 06:19.959
You can stay here.

06:19.960 --> 06:21.799
I'll clean out one of the sheds.

06:21.800 --> 06:26.005
That's OK, I'll find my
own place. Thanks.

06:36.160 --> 06:42.719
Misch-Misch, Khartoum,
Ali, Fahani and Aba.

06:44.320 --> 06:47.119
And these are my new
wild bulls... Dookie and Bub.

06:48.880 --> 06:50.599
What's wrong with him?

06:50.600 --> 06:55.319
Nothing's wrong with him.
He's in rut. He's a bull.

06:55.320 --> 06:57.639
Those other males are bullocks.

06:57.640 --> 06:59.599
These are still bulls.

07:02.960 --> 07:05.079
Die haben eier.

07:05.080 --> 07:08.919
In rut season, they become
extremely aggressive.

07:08.920 --> 07:10.679
Very dangerous.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.484
He doesn't look very dangerous.

07:13.400 --> 07:17.525
He's young. He will learn.

07:32.320 --> 07:34.921
Hey, Dookie.

07:35.840 --> 07:37.519
Hey, Dookie. Hello.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.239
Hey.

07:49.320 --> 07:51.679
Come on.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.922
So you want to play
with the camels?

07:58.560 --> 08:00.888
Always watch the animal.

08:01.840 --> 08:04.079
Watch how he thinks.

08:13.800 --> 08:16.287
Let him know who's boss.

08:17.960 --> 08:21.519
Come on. Try it again.

08:23.320 --> 08:26.839
Careful.

08:36.720 --> 08:39.241
Hurry up. We open soon.

08:43.840 --> 08:45.929
Are you finished?

08:47.920 --> 08:49.645
Yep.

08:52.520 --> 08:54.239
What's that?

08:54.240 --> 08:56.119
Sorry.

08:56.120 --> 09:00.245
Take off those shoes.
You must toughen the feet.

09:02.680 --> 09:05.008
There are two species of camel.

09:05.840 --> 09:08.799
Neither is native to Australia.

09:08.800 --> 09:11.159
Some of the first camels
brought into the country

09:11.160 --> 09:14.239
were for the Burke and Wills
expedition in 1860...

09:14.240 --> 09:16.199
Louder. More effort!

09:16.200 --> 09:19.882
Today there are over 50,000
feral camels across Australia.

09:37.080 --> 09:39.123
Hey! Goldie!

09:40.240 --> 09:42.807
Here, Goldie! Come on.

09:43.640 --> 09:45.410
Hold it.

09:47.200 --> 09:48.925
Wait.

10:02.880 --> 10:06.639
'If my trip was inspired by
anyone, it would be my father.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.799
He trekked across East
Africa in his youth

10:08.800 --> 10:11.606
and was happiest on his
own out in the bush.'

10:16.440 --> 10:18.919
'When I was young, he showed
me a tree on our property

10:18.920 --> 10:22.159
marked with the letter L by the
explorer Ludwig Leichhardt.

10:22.160 --> 10:25.839
In 1848, he attempted to
cross Australia to the ocean

10:25.840 --> 10:28.407
with 7 horses and 20 mules.

10:29.400 --> 10:31.602
He disappeared and was never found.

10:36.880 --> 10:39.759
I remember imagining
Ludwig alone in the desert

10:39.760 --> 10:41.599
with the animals,

10:41.600 --> 10:43.564
and it sounded like a dream.'

11:07.320 --> 11:09.359
Yeah?

11:09.360 --> 11:13.039
Can we talk about my trip?
My camels?

11:13.040 --> 11:15.319
Your camels?

11:15.320 --> 11:17.399
Yeah, our deal.

11:17.400 --> 11:20.570
I've tried to talk to you
about it already... twice.

11:21.560 --> 11:23.839
I need you to get
up early tomorrow.

11:23.840 --> 11:25.679
I want the camels in by five.

11:25.680 --> 11:27.759
I've been here for
over eight months now,

11:27.760 --> 11:29.919
I don't have to do shit for you.

11:29.920 --> 11:31.959
You're fired.

11:31.960 --> 11:33.879
I'm going to talk
to Gladdy about it.

11:33.880 --> 11:37.482
Gladdy's gone! And I
want you gone, too.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.727
I want all bitches
gone from my sight.

11:45.720 --> 11:48.239
'The early settlers
needed beasts of burden

11:48.240 --> 11:50.759
better suited to the harsh
climate of the outback,

11:50.760 --> 11:52.610
so they imported camels.

11:53.640 --> 11:55.359
When trains and cars came along

11:55.360 --> 11:57.319
and there was no longer
any use for them,

11:57.320 --> 11:58.999
the camels were set free.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.559
But instead of perishing,
they flourished.

12:02.560 --> 12:05.319
Now Australia has the largest
feral camel population

12:05.320 --> 12:06.999
in the world.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.328
I just needed three of them.'

12:57.840 --> 13:00.239
Hey. What do you think, Dig?

13:00.240 --> 13:02.363
Home sweet home, eh?

13:10.040 --> 13:14.079
You must be mad, girly. You
know that's about 2,000 miles?

13:14.080 --> 13:16.239
Six months of hard walking.

13:16.240 --> 13:18.519
It gets tougher if
you get an injury.

13:18.520 --> 13:24.568
No it's easy enough to get lost,
run out of water, food...

13:26.920 --> 13:29.399
You don't have to be
unlucky to die out there.

13:29.400 --> 13:31.919
I just want to be by myself.

13:31.920 --> 13:33.599
Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi!

13:35.200 --> 13:38.319
Well, we don't train these
camels for kiddie rides. Hm?

13:38.320 --> 13:40.359
We catch 'em, we sell 'em.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.639
So, will you help me out?

13:43.640 --> 13:45.639
I can teach you how to break one.

13:45.640 --> 13:47.639
The rest of it you
do in your own time.

13:47.640 --> 13:49.519
You'll hire me?

13:49.520 --> 13:52.039
Anyone who can put up with
Kurt Posel for eight months

13:52.040 --> 13:53.719
deserves a chance.

13:53.720 --> 13:55.570
Come back tomorrow. See how you go.

13:59.160 --> 14:03.279
'I went to work for a camel
wrangler named Sallay Mahomet.

14:03.280 --> 14:05.919
He came from a long line
of Afghan cameleers.'

14:05.920 --> 14:08.599
Righto! Arms up, you've
gotta look tall.

14:08.600 --> 14:10.279
Stand tall, arms up.

14:10.280 --> 14:13.599
'He offered me one wild camel for
a month's work at half pay.'

14:13.600 --> 14:15.559
Robyn, shut the gate.

15:24.720 --> 15:26.888
You'll have to break her.

15:29.440 --> 15:31.159
Thanks.

15:31.160 --> 15:33.010
You've earned it.

15:36.640 --> 15:39.002
You're an odd girl, Robyn Davidson.

16:13.800 --> 16:15.843
Rob?

16:17.200 --> 16:18.919
We know you're here!

16:18.920 --> 16:21.719
You can run but you can't hide!

16:21.720 --> 16:23.604
What are you doing here?

16:25.040 --> 16:26.679
How did you find me?

16:26.680 --> 16:28.279
Well, I asked around.

16:28.280 --> 16:30.919
I guess there's not too many
camel ladies in this town.

16:30.920 --> 16:34.359
Mm. I hate that. It makes me
sound like a crazy woman.

16:34.360 --> 16:36.244
Hey, come on.

16:38.200 --> 16:40.368
- Hi.
- How ya going, Robbie?

16:41.280 --> 16:44.839
This is Peter, Bernard, Annie
and Annie's mate Rick.

16:44.840 --> 16:46.439
He's out from the States.

16:46.440 --> 16:49.519
I love your place. I didn't
realise how big camels are.

16:49.520 --> 16:51.519
It's like a cow and a
giraffe mixture...

16:51.520 --> 16:53.643
They're beautiful.

16:55.040 --> 16:56.919
Going to invite us in?

16:56.920 --> 16:58.645
Yep, come in.

17:03.040 --> 17:07.839
That's what I have,
that's what I don't have.

17:07.839 --> 17:09.963
Plus I need two more camels.

17:10.839 --> 17:13.159
Mostly I just need money.

17:13.160 --> 17:15.638
Money, money, money.

17:15.640 --> 17:18.159
The eternal, uh... the
eternal explorer's dilemma.

17:18.160 --> 17:20.519
Hm.

17:20.520 --> 17:22.679
Well, why don't you
just shorten the trip?

17:22.680 --> 17:24.398
To the Rock and back?

17:24.400 --> 17:26.959
I mean, Toly and I will come
with you. We can chip in.

17:26.960 --> 17:28.959
- Yeah. Why not?
- Mm...

17:28.960 --> 17:32.319
Have you looked into
sponsorship? Like a magazine?

17:32.320 --> 17:35.119
- Rick knows lots of editors.
- Yeah, I know lots of editors.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.759
I could put in a good word for you.

17:36.760 --> 17:39.639
I think they'd think it was fas...
I think it's fascinating.

17:39.640 --> 17:41.319
So I know they would.

17:41.320 --> 17:43.090
Oh, it's OK. I'll do it myself.

17:55.440 --> 17:57.847
Do you know what's
going on politically?

18:27.760 --> 18:30.199
It's about acting on what
judgements you make...

18:30.200 --> 18:31.925
It's about making a critique...

18:41.600 --> 18:44.639
Hey, Zelly. Hey, girl.

18:44.640 --> 18:46.399
Hey.

18:55.360 --> 18:57.359
Kangaroo!

18:57.360 --> 18:59.399
Hey, do you mind?

18:59.400 --> 19:01.329
Sorry, bad habit.

19:02.560 --> 19:06.359
Oh, I, uh... I made you this.

19:09.680 --> 19:11.848
You're a darling. Thank you.

19:13.280 --> 19:17.201
You know, um... your room's
still available, Rob.

19:18.560 --> 19:20.250
Yeah...

19:21.960 --> 19:24.359
Bye, Rob! Love you!

19:24.360 --> 19:26.608
Bye, Robyn! Bye,
Diggity! Good luck!

19:27.560 --> 19:29.569
Don't die out there!

19:46.520 --> 19:48.639
I know you well enough

19:48.640 --> 19:50.559
never to ask why you're doing this,

19:50.560 --> 19:53.599
or why you want to do it alone.

19:53.600 --> 19:55.879
But I guess if the reason's
good enough for you,

19:55.880 --> 19:57.969
it's good enough for me.

19:58.960 --> 20:01.559
Anyway, I made you a
tape for your trip.

20:01.560 --> 20:03.359
That old record of your mother's,

20:03.360 --> 20:05.369
the one you used to play to death.

20:06.800 --> 20:09.999
Whatever it is you're
looking for, Robbie,

20:10.000 --> 20:12.279
find it and come home, OK?

20:12.280 --> 20:15.599
♪ The lonely night

20:15.600 --> 20:18.359
♪ Dreaming of a song

20:18.360 --> 20:24.439
♪ And the melody haunts my reverie

20:24.440 --> 20:28.839
♪ And I am once again with you

20:28.840 --> 20:32.119
♪ When our love was new... ♪

20:47.640 --> 20:51.999
Girlie, I reckon you've got
yourself a pregnant cow.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.799
What?

20:53.800 --> 20:57.599
Pregnant? But is that good or bad?

20:57.600 --> 20:59.999
You've got a calf tied
up in camp overnight,

21:00.000 --> 21:02.202
none of the others are
gonna stray very far.

21:03.280 --> 21:05.209
So that's good.

21:08.640 --> 21:12.159
'A few weeks later, I heard that
Kurt Posel sold his ranch.'

21:12.160 --> 21:14.159
Like I said, it's not possible.

21:14.160 --> 21:17.079
'The new owner had little
experience with camels.'

21:17.080 --> 21:21.999
One camel. That's all I want.
The bastard owed me two.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.929
Sorry. Never mentioned that to me.

21:24.880 --> 21:27.159
Hey, do you even know
what you're doing?

21:30.120 --> 21:31.919
I wouldn't use a nose-line.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.799
- Settle down, you bastard!
- Let go of the rope.

21:38.640 --> 21:41.207
Get outta there!

21:47.640 --> 21:49.679
Shut the gate.

21:49.680 --> 21:51.359
Hey, Dookie.

21:54.800 --> 21:56.359
Easy.

21:56.360 --> 21:58.599
That's the way.

21:58.600 --> 22:00.325
Come on, Dookie.

22:01.160 --> 22:04.842
Whoosh, Dookie. Whoosh.

22:28.920 --> 22:30.804
Do they do that often?

22:31.680 --> 22:34.079
- The bulls?
- Yeah.

22:34.080 --> 22:36.679
Oh, hell yeah. All the time.

22:36.680 --> 22:39.486
You want to keep your kids
away from them, for sure.

22:40.880 --> 22:42.923
Come on, Dig!

22:53.160 --> 22:54.879
'And so I'm writing to you

22:54.880 --> 22:57.559
in the hope that your magazine
will sponsor my trip.

22:57.560 --> 22:59.159
I believe National Geographic

22:59.160 --> 23:01.408
to be of the highest
international repute.

23:03.160 --> 23:04.839
The trip will take me through

23:04.840 --> 23:07.119
some of the most beautiful
and barren country

23:07.120 --> 23:08.759
the desert can show.

23:08.760 --> 23:10.759
I am enclosing a map
of my proposed route,

23:10.760 --> 23:12.639
from Alice Springs to Ayers Rock,

23:12.640 --> 23:15.411
then on through the Western
Desert to the Indian Ocean.'

23:20.840 --> 23:23.119
'I have three camels
and one small calf

23:23.120 --> 23:25.239
trained and ready to go.

23:25.240 --> 23:27.841
They are perfectly reliable beasts.

23:30.080 --> 23:31.919
Their names are Dookie...'

23:34.520 --> 23:37.559
'...Bub, Zelly

23:37.560 --> 23:39.762
and baby Goliath.

23:42.240 --> 23:45.399
I am well aware of the
hardship I will be facing

23:45.400 --> 23:47.959
and the first to admit I
am remarkably unqualified

23:47.960 --> 23:50.039
for such a hazardous undertaking.

23:50.040 --> 23:52.839
But this is precisely the
point of my journey.

23:52.840 --> 23:56.719
I'd like to think an ordinary
person is capable of anything.

23:56.720 --> 23:59.719
I look forward to hearing
from you in the near future.

23:59.720 --> 24:02.207
Yours faithfully, Robyn Davidson.'

24:21.760 --> 24:24.159
Sorry, Dookie.

24:24.160 --> 24:27.559
Grab that. A bull in rut would
do anything to get at Zelly.

24:27.560 --> 24:30.319
He'll bite, kick or kill
whatever gets in his way.

24:30.320 --> 24:32.359
That includes you.

24:43.080 --> 24:45.442
No choice. Hm?

24:46.600 --> 24:49.199
You see what happens when
one of these bull camels

24:49.200 --> 24:51.279
gets those lovelies
set on something.

24:51.280 --> 24:53.319
No stopping him.

24:53.320 --> 24:56.039
Rule number one...
protect your camels.

24:56.040 --> 24:58.919
If you're out there on your own
and a wild bull's coming at ya,

24:58.920 --> 25:00.559
you shoot it.

25:00.560 --> 25:02.603
Don't think. You shoot.
You understand?

25:08.120 --> 25:11.085
Ah, I forgot... these
packages came for you.

25:12.240 --> 25:14.010
Oh, there's a letter too.

25:35.240 --> 25:37.727
I got it! I got the money!

25:46.840 --> 25:49.719
I think they'd think it was fas...
I think it's fascinating.

25:49.720 --> 25:51.604
So I know they would.

26:05.720 --> 26:07.839
- Aunty Robbie!
- Aunty Rob!

26:07.840 --> 26:09.519
We came to say goodbye!

26:09.520 --> 26:12.719
How you doing? Hey,
come here. Look at you.

26:12.720 --> 26:14.410
Hey, sis.

26:16.400 --> 26:18.921
- You look well.
- Thanks for coming.

26:19.880 --> 26:21.809
Hey, Pop.

26:33.840 --> 26:35.963
I want to pat the camel!

26:40.640 --> 26:42.524
Wow.

26:54.400 --> 26:56.250
Oh, it's freezing in here.

27:01.400 --> 27:03.119
Hi.

27:03.120 --> 27:06.879
Um... this is Rick,
the photographer.

27:06.880 --> 27:09.048
Hi, you must be her father?

27:10.080 --> 27:11.964
Sister?

27:13.640 --> 27:15.888
I don't know who you are.

27:21.080 --> 27:23.044
This is obviously for me.

27:23.880 --> 27:26.003
This was surprisingly expensive.

27:26.840 --> 27:30.203
Inflatable raft. For flash floods.

27:32.080 --> 27:33.850
And...

27:41.400 --> 27:45.559
Um... why would I need
an exercise bike?

27:45.560 --> 27:47.159
Oh, it's not an exercise bike.

27:47.160 --> 27:49.799
It's a... backup
generator for the radio

27:49.800 --> 27:51.719
in case the batteries fail.

27:51.720 --> 27:54.279
I'm... I'm not taking a radio.

27:54.280 --> 27:56.079
Please, Robyn, just take the radio.

27:56.080 --> 27:58.806
You want to die out
there or something?

28:03.400 --> 28:06.439
Take the radio. In case.

28:06.440 --> 28:09.359
OK, I'll take the radio, but
I'm not taking the bike.

28:09.360 --> 28:11.359
You know, it's really
reassuring to know

28:11.360 --> 28:13.319
that my sister won't
be alone out there.

28:13.320 --> 28:15.639
I'm only meeting up with
her four or five times.

28:15.640 --> 28:18.764
Two or three times. Two or three.

28:31.760 --> 28:33.399
No, I don't want a gun.

28:33.400 --> 28:35.125
But you will.

29:01.120 --> 29:03.891
Hi. Hi.

29:09.440 --> 29:11.210
Take care, Pop.

29:13.560 --> 29:15.410
Thanks.

29:19.400 --> 29:22.799
If you get in trouble, there's
no shame in turning back, OK?

29:22.800 --> 29:25.162
- OK?
- OK.

29:34.960 --> 29:38.119
- Bye, darlin'.
- Bye, Aunty Rob!

29:38.120 --> 29:40.079
- Bye, Aunty Robbie!
- Bye, Robyn.

29:40.080 --> 29:42.487
- Call us from Ayers Rock.
- Bye, Diggity!

29:43.840 --> 29:46.725
Diggity, come on!

30:16.960 --> 30:19.039
You've gotta be kidding me.

30:19.040 --> 30:20.959
Hey hey!

30:20.960 --> 30:23.559
That's great. And keep
back, looking at me.

30:23.560 --> 30:25.364
Alright.

30:26.440 --> 30:28.802
Good. Good. And smile.

30:29.640 --> 30:32.239
Great. Great. That's great.
OK. Great.

30:32.240 --> 30:34.359
Oh, let me get this
other stuff right here.

30:34.360 --> 30:37.319
Everybody I keep telling about
this really can't believe it.

30:37.320 --> 30:39.399
'2,000 miles? Is she
crazy or something?'

30:43.760 --> 30:46.199
Let me find your light
a little bit. Face a little...

30:46.200 --> 30:47.919
That's great.

30:47.920 --> 30:51.119
OK, what's the camel's
name? Bub! Hey!

30:51.120 --> 30:52.959
Everybody smile.

30:52.960 --> 30:54.799
How do you feel?

30:54.800 --> 30:56.399
Are we done?

30:56.400 --> 30:58.568
Yeah, I think you're...
I think it's good.

31:01.200 --> 31:02.959
Alright, see you in a month.

32:09.200 --> 32:12.529
Oi, lady, can we get
a photo? Over here!

32:17.040 --> 32:18.719
Sorry, campground's full.

32:18.720 --> 32:20.359
It would just be for one night.

32:20.360 --> 32:22.959
Besides, camels aren't
allowed in the park grounds.

32:22.960 --> 32:24.799
Why?

32:24.800 --> 32:26.839
'Cause it's a sacred site.

32:26.840 --> 32:28.929
Hey, camel lady!

33:01.040 --> 33:02.679
Figuring 20 miles a day,

33:02.680 --> 33:04.599
if that's how fast
you're travelling,

33:04.600 --> 33:06.359
determine how long
it takes to get to

33:06.360 --> 33:08.319
the next town with a
mail plane service,

33:08.320 --> 33:10.519
divide that by 20, and I
should, more or less,

33:10.520 --> 33:12.959
be able to figure out when
you're gonna be arriving.

33:12.960 --> 33:14.639
I ran into a group of Aboriginals

33:14.640 --> 33:16.959
who were able to point me
in the right direction.

33:16.960 --> 33:19.679
They just knew where you were.
I said 'camel lady' and...

33:19.680 --> 33:21.999
I guess there's not really
a lot of camel ladies.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.639
Before I get on any kind of plane,

33:23.640 --> 33:26.319
I have this ritual I've been
doing for the past five years

33:26.320 --> 33:29.279
where I eat an orange before and
after when I get off the flight.

33:29.280 --> 33:30.839
And this time I was gonna do it,

33:30.840 --> 33:32.799
but I didn't 'cause
I ran out of time.

33:32.800 --> 33:35.241
I got back late and
my deli was closed.

33:38.200 --> 33:40.439
Wow. I love lentils.

33:40.440 --> 33:43.919
Maybe try some with, uh...
with the hat.

33:45.800 --> 33:48.919
The white really pops against
the red of the Rock.

33:48.920 --> 33:51.039
And don't worry, I'm
shooting on a long lens

33:51.040 --> 33:52.679
so it compresses the distance...

33:52.680 --> 33:55.159
it looks like you're standing
right in front of it.

33:55.160 --> 33:56.959
Great. OK, maybe a... a tiny smile?

33:56.960 --> 33:59.083
What about honest journalism?

34:02.920 --> 34:04.999
Hey, camel lady!

34:05.000 --> 34:06.759
A friend of mine, David Burnett,

34:06.760 --> 34:09.759
says the greatest photographs
are motivated by human feeling.

34:09.760 --> 34:11.399
Are we done?

34:11.400 --> 34:13.559
Uh, almost.

34:13.560 --> 34:15.599
Oh, no, I thought the hat was good!

34:15.600 --> 34:17.609
See you tomorrow.

35:07.160 --> 35:09.203
Parasite.

35:10.240 --> 35:11.999
Go away.

35:58.560 --> 36:00.842
So your father was
an explorer, huh?

36:01.680 --> 36:03.879
Not really.

36:03.880 --> 36:05.730
Oh, I thought you said he was.

36:06.560 --> 36:08.599
I said he walked
around East Africa,

36:08.600 --> 36:10.928
harpooning crocodiles
and looking for gold.

36:15.520 --> 36:17.404
What about your mom?

36:19.960 --> 36:21.924
I don't really remember her.

36:23.880 --> 36:26.119
Oh, what happened to her?

36:26.120 --> 36:27.890
She hung herself.

36:41.400 --> 36:44.039
♪ ...why I spend

36:44.040 --> 36:47.562
♪ The lonely night

36:48.600 --> 36:50.564
♪ Dreaming of a song

36:51.520 --> 36:56.806
♪ The melody haunts my reverie... ♪

37:35.400 --> 37:37.284
Jesus.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.650
I'm gonna grab all this...!

37:53.400 --> 37:55.284
Agh!

37:57.600 --> 38:00.199
Put the bed stuff in
the back of the truck!

38:00.200 --> 38:01.970
Leave that, get the food.

38:09.800 --> 38:11.570
Whoosh, Dookie, whoosh.

38:15.200 --> 38:17.084
Diggity!

38:20.440 --> 38:22.210
Robyn!

38:23.600 --> 38:25.679
Fuck off!

38:40.200 --> 38:41.759
Could've been worse...

38:41.760 --> 38:44.725
we could've been in a small
plane flying through a typhoon.

38:45.560 --> 38:48.399
That's something you don't
want to experience.

38:48.400 --> 38:51.239
I was in Irian Jaya covering
the riots for Time.

38:51.240 --> 38:54.359
David Burnett was there.
He won the Capa Medal in '73.

38:54.360 --> 38:57.439
He's a good friend of mine. We
were trying to land the plane

38:57.440 --> 38:59.639
on this narrow strip on
the side of a mountain

38:59.640 --> 39:02.159
and the wind kept blowing
the wings back and forth...

39:02.160 --> 39:03.964
I just can't stand it anymore.

39:05.280 --> 39:09.879
This whole thing is just some
ludicrous, pointless farce.

39:09.880 --> 39:12.799
Every day, I load a pile of junk,

39:12.800 --> 39:15.719
I walk 20 miles,
I unload a pile of junk,

39:15.720 --> 39:19.839
and you just stand around like
some idiot, taking pictures of me.

39:19.840 --> 39:21.679
And I can't do it anymore!

39:34.200 --> 39:36.129
It's OK.

40:33.360 --> 40:35.210
Dookie! Leave him alone.

40:58.040 --> 40:59.969
- Good morning.
- Morning.

41:08.440 --> 41:10.324
You don't have to do that.

41:16.320 --> 41:19.922
So I think... I was thinking
about staying on for a few days.

41:20.760 --> 41:22.439
Why?

41:22.440 --> 41:24.165
Just, uh...

41:29.720 --> 41:32.048
So I guess I'll see
you in five weeks.

41:32.880 --> 41:34.366
OK.

41:40.240 --> 41:42.408
Whoa-kay.

42:12.560 --> 42:14.285
Hey, Dig. Come here.

42:17.960 --> 42:20.731
Come on! Don't get out.

42:27.200 --> 42:29.199
Come on, girl, come back in.

42:58.360 --> 43:01.006
Hey. Hey.

43:22.560 --> 43:24.410
Where are they, Dig?

43:29.880 --> 43:31.809
Dookie!

43:33.320 --> 43:35.363
Zelly!

43:38.200 --> 43:40.164
Bub!

43:47.440 --> 43:49.608
Dookie!

44:10.280 --> 44:12.199
Hey.

44:12.200 --> 44:13.919
You stay here, OK?

44:13.920 --> 44:15.360
Good girl.

44:41.280 --> 44:43.439
Dookie!

44:52.720 --> 44:55.199
Never do this to me again!

44:55.200 --> 44:57.164
Don't you ever leave me!

45:03.880 --> 45:05.844
Sorry.

45:22.760 --> 45:25.201
Hey, Dig. Hey.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.567
- Hi.
- Hi.

45:49.440 --> 45:51.719
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

45:51.720 --> 45:53.399
I missed you.

45:53.400 --> 45:55.284
I take it you're the camel lady.

45:56.120 --> 45:59.079
- Hi. Thanks for having us here.
- You're welcome.

45:59.080 --> 46:02.489
Sorry, can I get you guys
to shake hands again?

46:07.280 --> 46:09.005
Great, thank you.

46:10.840 --> 46:12.519
Hello there.

46:12.520 --> 46:16.247
The, uh, old fellas can be a bit
stand-offish with strangers.

46:17.920 --> 46:20.159
Takes a while for them to warm up.

46:35.360 --> 46:37.608
Would you mind not taking pictures?

46:39.760 --> 46:41.519
A man has to do his job.

46:41.520 --> 46:45.079
That's exactly the reason blacks
were dumped in missions...

46:45.080 --> 46:47.399
men just doing their job.

46:47.400 --> 46:49.887
11 million readers will
see these photographs.

46:50.720 --> 46:54.759
I like to think that what I'm...
doing is a service.

46:54.760 --> 46:56.399
Couple of pictures in a magazine?

46:56.400 --> 46:58.799
You think that's really
going to make a difference?

46:58.800 --> 47:00.439
Yeah, I do.

47:00.440 --> 47:03.319
If it wasn't for the magazine,
you wouldn't be on this trip.

48:24.800 --> 48:26.604
You didn't, did you?

48:27.440 --> 48:29.449
Nobody saw me.

48:31.400 --> 48:33.639
It was great images.

48:33.640 --> 48:37.119
Some kind of... grieving ceremony.

48:37.120 --> 48:39.399
That was secret business.

48:39.400 --> 48:41.364
Get it? Secret.

48:43.640 --> 48:46.366
After Malaysia, I have
a shoot in Tasmania.

48:47.560 --> 48:50.119
I'll check in on this
number for messages.

48:50.120 --> 48:52.527
OK, I should make Warburton
in about six weeks.

48:53.400 --> 48:55.284
I'll be there.

49:13.240 --> 49:15.090
Can I sit here?

49:31.160 --> 49:33.647
Husband no good.

49:34.520 --> 49:36.484
He's not my husband.

49:40.920 --> 49:45.279
There's an adviser named Glendle
living outside Pipalyatjara.

49:45.280 --> 49:49.039
Now he's the last whitefella
you'll see until Warburton.

49:49.040 --> 49:51.759
OK. But this is the most
direct route, though, right?

49:51.760 --> 49:55.079
Yeah, but it's dotted
with sacred sites.

49:55.080 --> 49:57.439
It's forbidden to
women, I'm afraid.

49:57.440 --> 49:59.839
You'd need an old fella
to guide you through.

49:59.840 --> 50:03.362
But the other way is 160
miles out of my way.

50:04.800 --> 50:06.879
If you like, I can ask round,

50:06.880 --> 50:09.890
see if there's an Elder who
would travel with you.

50:18.800 --> 50:20.399
Seems your boyfriend

50:20.400 --> 50:22.559
was seen taking photos
of secret business.

50:22.560 --> 50:24.319
He's not my boyfriend.

50:24.320 --> 50:26.170
Sorry. Can't help you.

50:27.000 --> 50:28.770
Their answer is no.

50:32.640 --> 50:35.286
Just tell them I'm sorry.

50:43.080 --> 50:45.521
Looks like we're taking
the long way, Bub.

51:41.040 --> 51:43.119
If you're out there on your own

51:43.120 --> 51:45.839
and a wild bull's coming
at ya, you shoot it.

51:45.840 --> 51:48.122
Don't think. You shoot.
You understand?

55:22.560 --> 55:24.279
Where you go?

55:24.280 --> 55:25.919
West to the ocean.

55:25.920 --> 55:28.439
Uru Pulka? Big lake?

55:28.440 --> 55:30.210
Yeah, Uru Pulka.

55:31.080 --> 55:35.171
Too long way. Too long way for you.

55:45.920 --> 55:48.439
You go Pipalyatjara?

55:48.440 --> 55:50.768
- Yeah.
- Which way?

55:51.600 --> 55:53.879
Along the road.

55:53.880 --> 55:56.651
Too far. Too many sleeps that way.

55:57.520 --> 55:59.802
Miil-miil. Sacred country.

56:01.680 --> 56:03.564
Need old fella.

56:16.840 --> 56:23.446
Mr Eddy.

58:23.920 --> 58:25.639
Glendle?

58:27.320 --> 58:29.119
Glendle.

58:29.120 --> 58:31.079
I know he helped me get the money,

58:31.080 --> 58:33.919
but he doesn't understand that
he's part of the problem.

58:33.920 --> 58:37.359
He's a nice person, but I don't
want him and his cameras

58:37.360 --> 58:39.679
and his hopeless romantic notions

58:39.680 --> 58:41.719
along with my trip, you know?

58:41.720 --> 58:43.759
I can deal with pigs really easily,

58:43.760 --> 58:45.759
but nice people confound me.

58:45.760 --> 58:47.879
You know, how can you
tell a nice person

58:47.880 --> 58:51.846
that you just wish they'd
crawl into a hole and die?

58:52.880 --> 58:54.799
Sorry.

58:54.800 --> 58:57.401
It's been a while since I've
had anybody to talk to.

58:58.240 --> 58:59.879
You had Eddy.

58:59.880 --> 59:02.559
He's one of the most respected
Elders in the community.

59:02.560 --> 59:04.799
Yeah. I wish I could.

59:04.800 --> 59:08.129
Ah... Words are overrated.

59:11.520 --> 59:13.882
Hey, it's been real
nice having you around.

59:14.960 --> 59:17.162
Hope you can stick
around for a bit.

59:18.400 --> 59:20.329
Thanks.

59:52.640 --> 59:55.119
Will you walk to
Warburton with me, Eddy?

59:55.120 --> 59:56.959
Hey?

59:56.960 --> 01:00:00.439
To Warburton? Will
you walk with me?

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:02.439
Long way, Warburton.

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.529
Little bit long way.

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:09.122
- Long way?
- Yeah, long way.

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:15.408
My... My shoes no good.

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:20.649
OK. Hm.

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:29.368
Looks good in your shoes, huh?

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:38.279
Do you think he's up for this?
It's over 200 miles.

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:41.450
Him? He'll outwalk the two of us.

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:50.169
Don't forget my telegram.

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:04.999
OK. Thanks.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.804
- Bye.
- See ya.

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:12.079
Bye!

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:15.727
Come on, Dig.

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:30.242
Come on, Goliath.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.639
Come on, Goliath.

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:41.165
Come on, Goliath.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:52.244
The ground's too hot.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.850
Come on, Golly. That's the way.

01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:08.079
You got new shoes.

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:31.399
What is it?

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:35.879
Mingkulpa. Alright? Mingkulpa.

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:37.719
Should I... Do I eat it?

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:44.399
Mmm.

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:22.488
Whoosh, Bub. That's the way.

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:32.079
How was it, Eddy?

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:46.719
Whitefellas.

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:48.445
Where?

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:02.199
Come on, Bub.

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:04.279
Stand up. Come on.

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:07.359
Come on, Bub. Come on.

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:09.881
Stand up. Come on, get up.

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:14.679
Come on, Bub. Come on.

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:20.039
Get them to stop.

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:21.879
Can you stop so we
can take a photo?

01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:23.559
- Wait up!
- Come on, Eddy.

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:25.199
Hold up there, love.

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:26.879
Do you mind if we take a picture?

01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:29.159
- Can we take a photo?
- Can I take your photo?

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:30.919
Yeah, let us take your photo.

01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:32.879
Can you stop so I can take a photo?

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:34.559
Please?

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:37.119
- Where are you heading?
- Thanks, love.

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:39.159
How far are you going?

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:40.879
I'm going to the ocean.

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:43.359
To the ocean? You're dreaming.

01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:46.199
Hey, Jacky-Jacky. Get a
photo with the camel, boy.

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:48.079
- Take your picture, eh?
- Hey. Jack.

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:49.999
- You're a prick!
- Whoa, whoa, steady!

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.359
- What's her problem?
- Bloody swine!

01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:54.599
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Give me money.

01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:56.759
Give me money! Give me money!

01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:58.999
- Got any money?
- Agghh! Agghh!

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.521
- Three dollar!
- Yeah, don't give him too much.

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:44.369
Wiya, wiya, wiya, wiya!

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:50.085
No, I don't understand.

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:58.119
Woman never break the law.
Woman never break the law.

01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:01.519
OK, I won't. I won't. Only men
do the cutting. I understand.

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:04.965
OK.

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:27.087
...Rick.

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:39.046
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:45.563
This is Mr Eddy.

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:48.250
Eddy, Rick.

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:54.648
I got your telegram.

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:04.119
Thanks.

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:06.004
You're welcome.

01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:09.119
This is for you.

01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:11.209
Oh...

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:36.051
Diggity! Stay close!

01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:12.483
What happened to this place?

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:17.368
Nobody here. Everybody all gone.

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:49.523
I look up, he nearly kill me.

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:10.203
So... Eddy's very insistent
that you take along an Elder.

01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:14.319
Yeah. I prefer to do
this stretch on my own.

01:09:14.319 --> 01:09:17.519
Yeah, but it's better to do
this stretch with company.

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:19.529
No, I'll be fine.

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:23.448
You won't find a drop of water.

01:09:24.359 --> 01:09:26.158
It'll be two months' travel

01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:28.886
on a dead-straight track
through empty desert.

01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:32.207
It's lucky to get six
cars a year along it.

01:09:33.319 --> 01:09:35.283
I'll be fine.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.999
Would it make any
difference if I told you

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.839
I didn't want you to go alone?

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:43.359
What do you think?

01:09:43.359 --> 01:09:45.608
Well, I think you have
a problem with people.

01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:58.599
You know, I'm sorry but I'm
driving ahead to Wiluna

01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:00.768
and dropping water
drums along the track.

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:06.599
That's almost 1,000
miles out of your way.

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:08.404
Yeah. Yeah, I know how far it is.

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:13.241
- Are you sure?
- 100%.

01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:16.723
I'll mark the drop
points on your map.

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:19.639
OK.

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:21.330
Thanks.

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:45.399
Good luck.

01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:47.239
Goodbye.

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:48.521
Thank you.

01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:00.085
Come on.

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:03.290
Steady.

01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:00.608
The compass, Dig.

01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:03.445
Fuck.

01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:06.244
Come on, Dig.

01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:24.610
Hey.

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:33.484
Your mother gave me that.

01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:38.610
Thanks, Pop.

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:43.159
You be sure you look after it.

01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:44.930
I will.

01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:31.569
Where are we, Dig?

01:14:57.720 --> 01:14:59.570
Fuck.

01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:18.359
Diggity. Hey. Go home.

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:21.159
Go on. Go home.

01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:28.402
Home! Diggity, go home!

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:43.529
Go home. Go on, go home, Dig.

01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:49.082
Diggity, go home.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.279
Diggity! Good girl!

01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:12.439
Hey!

01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:18.079
We're back! Did you miss me?

01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:22.679
Come on. Come on, bring
it back. Come on, girl.

01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:31.639
Good girl.

01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:33.319
Hello.

01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:35.039
Hi.

01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:37.319
Hey. Come on, girl.

01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:39.329
Come on, give it here.

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:36.559
Aaargghh!

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:39.491
Go away! Go away!

01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:17.525
Hey! Is that the camel lady?

01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:23.439
Oh. G'day.

01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:26.039
Oh. Fire's nice, eh?

01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:28.439
Been following your
tracks since Warburton.

01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:30.879
Yeah, I'm going for
an overland record.

01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:33.519
Flat chat out of Bundaberg,
straight shot to Ningaloo.

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:36.919
Nonstop, mate.
Reckon I'm the first.

01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:38.719
I'm gonna be famous.

01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:42.839
Suzuki TS400. Bike of the future.

01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:45.199
Fuck me, it's cold out here.

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:46.919
Yeah.

01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:48.719
You like bikes?

01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:51.759
Nah. Nah, nah, you like...
you like camels.

01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:53.799
Yeah, nice, nice.

01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:56.879
Yeah. Gives you a chance
to see the scenery, eh?

01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:58.679
Me, all I wanna see of the desert

01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:00.679
is a fuckin' blur, you know?

01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:03.002
Hello, dear. Nice to see you.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.123
Will you come in for tea?

01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:14.599
Where you from?

01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:18.679
I grew up on a cattle
station near Darling Downs.

01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:20.848
Oh, a Queenslander, eh?

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.039
What'd you run?

01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:25.844
Hereford.

01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:31.648
Hard country, that.

01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:35.399
Reckon she copped her
share of drought, eh?

01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:37.602
Seven years.

01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:44.889
Muster through it, did ya?

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:48.608
We went broke.

01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:21.730
♪ Dye-da-dye

01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:25.839

Miss Davidson? Robyn?

01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:47.000
- Hello?
- Where are you, Robyn?

01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:09.679
- Wait a minute!
- Here she is!

01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:12.039
- Hey! Whoa!
- Hey! Hey, Robyn!

01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:15.879
Stay right where you are! Hang on!

01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:18.319

Hey, you OK? You alright?

01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:22.439

you for over a week.

Miss Davidson!

01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:28.119
Calm down! Just stand back!

01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:33.399
- Just give her a little space.
- Leave me alone!

01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:37.524
Go away!

01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:40.769

Where's Dig?

01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:47.565
She's gone.

01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:51.209
Poison.

01:36:55.960 --> 01:36:59.721
You have one from London,
another from New York.

01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:03.605
Paris, Saigon, Singapore...

01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:07.607
Wow. I can't even read
where that's from.

01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:11.239
Doesn't matter anyway.

01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:13.239
What doesn't matter?

01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:15.039
This trip.

01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:17.322
I never should have started it.

01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:41.839
They're gone?

01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:45.522
Yeah. For now.

01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:51.679
Ow.

01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:53.450
Sorry.

01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:02.524
Rick?

01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:12.049
I'm so alone.

01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:16.044
We all are.

01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:31.888
I miss her so much.

01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:03.481
Agh! No!

01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:11.919
Hey!

01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:13.724
Way up high!

01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:26.884
Alright, you ready?

01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:35.523
I've been thinking...

01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:40.999
Yeah?

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.168
I want to finish what I started.

01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:46.767
You know, but I can't face
those reporters again.

01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:51.208
Oh, I can go ahead of
you into town and...

01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:54.919
and say that one of
your camels is sick,

01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:57.079
and it won't be
better for six weeks.

01:40:57.080 --> 01:40:58.719
Trust me, none of them

01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:00.763
will be able to stay
there for six weeks.

01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:04.287
You think they'll go?

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:10.124
No, they'll be waiting
for you at Carnarvon.

01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:12.879
But I'm not going to Carnarvon.

01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:14.570
I know.

01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:06.359
Come on.

01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:08.130
Here, Dook.

01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:44.244
Steady.

01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:03.484
Come on.

01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:53.039
Here, Bub.

01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:55.049
Ooh! Ooh!

01:43:55.920 --> 01:43:57.679
Just be careful.

01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:06.610
Come on.

01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:12.802
Come on.

01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:22.410
Come on.
