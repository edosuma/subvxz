WEBVTT

00:04.496 --> 00:05.628
You watch me.

00:06.019 --> 00:07.190
I'll be back.

00:07.222 --> 00:09.159
- She is a monster.
- I think she's brilliant.

00:09.339 --> 00:11.261
She's calling him Lincoln.

00:11.425 --> 00:13.823
Congratulations,
Great-Grandmother.

00:14.230 --> 00:15.433
These people are refugees,

00:15.458 --> 00:17.327
which means they're
allowed to seek asylum.

00:17.354 --> 00:19.564
My name is Viktor.
Viktor Goraya.

00:19.923 --> 00:21.158
I'm transhuman.

00:21.446 --> 00:23.977
I'm going to escape this
thing and become digital.

00:24.145 --> 00:26.486
- Come back to bed.
- You have sex with your robot!

00:26.705 --> 00:28.063
Danny! Danny!

00:31.193 --> 00:34.349
America, they've
fired a nuclear missile.

00:36.167 --> 00:37.346
What happens now?!

00:57.710 --> 00:59.722
All right, stop!

01:01.149 --> 01:03.877
You can stop the
alarm, thank you.

01:04.747 --> 01:06.127
Oh, God. I give up.

01:09.526 --> 01:11.010
Signor!

01:12.133 --> 01:14.603
You can stop the alarm, Signor!

01:15.047 --> 01:17.107
- Alarm stopped.
- Thank you.

01:17.541 --> 01:20.305
The last time we had an alarm
in this kitchen, we all thought

01:20.330 --> 01:23.182
the world was coming to an
end, so that's quite enough.

01:23.207 --> 01:25.993
Do you wish to be reminded
of the reason for the alarm?

01:27.325 --> 01:29.048
Oh, well, yes.

01:29.073 --> 01:30.109
I was coming to that.

01:30.337 --> 01:32.757
The alarm is a reminder
for Edith Lyons...

01:32.782 --> 01:35.251
Oh, yes! Yes!

01:35.276 --> 01:36.829
Call the family.

01:37.883 --> 01:40.164
Oh, I know. Calling family link.

01:40.189 --> 01:42.491
- Is that right?
- Calling family link.

01:42.906 --> 01:45.140
We're all here,
Gran. We're waiting.

01:45.421 --> 01:46.435
It's a big moment.

01:46.460 --> 01:48.038
Some of us have got work to do.

01:48.111 --> 01:49.781
Happy as ever, Celeste.

01:50.021 --> 01:51.582
It's lovely to hear
your voice, Muriel.

01:51.771 --> 01:52.885
Where are the boys?
Are they with us?

01:52.909 --> 01:53.999
Dan, are you on the link?

01:54.024 --> 01:56.095
Yeah, yeah, I'm here. I'm here.

01:56.285 --> 01:59.048
Hey! What are you doing?
No, no, no, no! We're not... No!

02:00.744 --> 02:02.149
Just don't!

02:02.258 --> 02:04.056
I'm glad we haven't got vision.

02:04.267 --> 02:05.785
Are you with us, Rosie?

02:06.152 --> 02:09.259
I keep telling the boys we all used
to watch TV on Saturday mornings.

02:09.424 --> 02:12.300
- Doesn't exist any more.
- Well, this is better than cartoons.

02:12.301 --> 02:13.324
Shush! She's on!

02:13.325 --> 02:15.534
We can interview someone
who was actually a witness

02:15.558 --> 02:20.160
to that terrible event on Hong
Sha, political activist Edith Lyons.

02:20.488 --> 02:22.035
Tell me a little
bit about that time.

02:22.117 --> 02:26.316
Oh. Six months ago, we all
thought we were going to die...

02:26.714 --> 02:29.003
- That's what I just said.
- Shush, Gran!

02:29.028 --> 02:31.377
And then we realised the day
after Hiroshima, what happened...

02:31.401 --> 02:33.315
sun came up,
people got out of bed,

02:33.316 --> 02:36.634
they went to work, a
nuclear bomb exploded,

02:37.269 --> 02:39.611
and the West just carried on.

02:39.681 --> 02:43.347
And China backed down,
but with 45,000 dead.

02:43.627 --> 02:46.339
And that's why we need these
sanctions against America.

02:46.340 --> 02:49.783
They turned a trade
war into an actual war.

02:49.908 --> 02:51.173
She doesn't understand a thing.

02:51.265 --> 02:53.041
And who pays the price? Me.

02:53.066 --> 02:54.105
Your auntie's an idiot.

02:54.280 --> 02:56.189
You were in
Vietnam. Is that right?

02:56.478 --> 03:01.134
For the explosion. Then we took a
ship and we sailed towards Hong Sha.

03:01.159 --> 03:03.494
We took this
footage with drones.

03:04.213 --> 03:05.556
Look, there were people!

03:05.689 --> 03:08.588
The bomb goes off and that's all
they leave behind, is the shadow.

03:09.367 --> 03:11.327
What's she like? Edith?

03:12.116 --> 03:13.151
Bit serious.

03:13.548 --> 03:16.963
- Yeah, but when you were kids.
- Yeah. Serious even then.

03:18.053 --> 03:19.493
I don't know. She's
older than I am.

03:20.069 --> 03:21.783
She was more friends
with Stephen, really.

03:21.858 --> 03:23.611
We went Interrailing once, but

03:24.447 --> 03:27.327
she wanted to sleep on
beaches and go to markets

03:27.328 --> 03:28.611
and find things to smoke.

03:29.038 --> 03:30.486
I just wanted a nice hotel.

03:30.991 --> 03:32.062
Is she rich?

03:32.572 --> 03:34.619
I'd like to know.
Why do you think?

03:35.128 --> 03:37.800
- 'Cos she's famous.
- Not really.

03:38.112 --> 03:40.714
This is Channel India. There
must be five of us watching.

03:40.745 --> 03:42.088
She lives on a boat.

03:42.229 --> 03:45.041
Yeah, but there's like 15
on board. Bet it's stinking.

03:45.066 --> 03:48.252
If I could ask, what's
the range of your drones?

03:48.277 --> 03:49.339
What does that matter?

03:49.503 --> 03:52.784
We estimate they've got
a range of five miles, so...

03:53.253 --> 03:56.869
So you took your ship five
miles off the coast of Hong Sha

03:56.894 --> 03:59.261
within two days
of the explosion?

03:59.286 --> 04:01.711
- What?
- She said 50 miles.

04:01.790 --> 04:03.056
She said she was safe.

04:03.604 --> 04:06.510
Were you poisoned by radiation?

04:06.768 --> 04:09.019
I think you should focus on
the victims within China itself.

04:09.043 --> 04:12.119
We calculate, at the very
least, you were exposed to

04:12.144 --> 04:15.174
one gray of radiation, so
the damage has been done.

04:16.088 --> 04:19.673
You might have limited your
lifespan to another 20 years.

04:20.158 --> 04:21.861
So? That could take me to 60.

04:23.088 --> 04:24.100
Then it's true.

04:27.499 --> 04:28.510
Yeah.

04:28.986 --> 04:30.713
She tells us on TV?!

04:30.963 --> 04:32.479
Oh, my God, she's an idiot!

04:32.596 --> 04:34.564
Gran, stop
watching! Turn it off.

04:35.323 --> 04:39.618
- Signor, call Edith Lyons now.
- End link. Calling Edith Lyons.

04:39.767 --> 04:42.392
Is she dying? Is
Auntie Edith dying?

04:42.516 --> 04:44.228
Hm? Eventually.

04:45.072 --> 04:47.173
This is Edith's phone.
Leave a message.

04:47.986 --> 04:49.329
Edith, we're all watching.

04:49.805 --> 04:51.164
You promised me you were safe.

04:51.375 --> 04:53.329
Yeah, thanks very much, Edith.

04:53.330 --> 04:56.164
What a way to let
us know, eh, on TV?

04:58.078 --> 04:59.891
Gran? You okay?

05:00.346 --> 05:03.086
Okay. That might be
true, but never mind me.

05:03.211 --> 05:06.688
Hong Sha Dao will have
consequences for all of us,

05:06.978 --> 05:10.981
and it terrifies me because
the world keeps getting hotter

05:11.006 --> 05:14.005
and faster and madder,
and we don't pause.

05:14.030 --> 05:16.017
We don't think. We don't learn.

05:16.042 --> 05:18.061
We just keep racing
to the next disaster,

05:18.177 --> 05:19.914
and I keep
wondering what's next.

05:20.072 --> 05:22.555
Where are we going?
When's it ever going to stop?

05:23.169 --> 05:26.176
President Pence has
defied the United Nations.

05:26.201 --> 05:27.871
But we're making it worse.

05:27.961 --> 05:31.086
The more we impose sanctions,
the more America swings to the right.

05:31.338 --> 05:33.341
Okay, Putin, president for life.

05:33.342 --> 05:35.414
Xi Jinping, president for life.

05:35.439 --> 05:38.142
And now, Pence just a
puppet. Trump is still in charge.

05:38.167 --> 05:40.853
These old men are
in power forever.

05:46.294 --> 05:47.877
Remind us what charities
you've been playing for.

05:47.901 --> 05:50.493
Mine's a children's
hospice in Coventry.

05:50.750 --> 05:54.095
And mine's to build a statue for
all the horses killed in World War I.

05:54.704 --> 05:57.321
The bird population across
Britain has fallen by 50%,

05:57.539 --> 05:59.874
because the insect
population has fallen by 80%.

06:00.004 --> 06:01.811
That's 80% in 30 years.

06:05.034 --> 06:08.300
♪ Happy birthday to you... ♪

06:11.203 --> 06:15.083
So that's it. I'm out of work. My
bosses are basically Americans.

06:15.108 --> 06:17.019
With all these sanctions,
they're going to withdraw.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.042
- You'll get a payoff, though.
- They're saying no.

06:19.066 --> 06:20.928
They're saying, "Take
us to court. Tough!"

06:21.337 --> 06:24.397
I need to free up some capital,
so we'll have to sell this house.

06:24.482 --> 06:26.881
We're downsizing. We
just need somewhere small.

06:26.906 --> 06:29.186
I'm not moving! I'm not!

06:31.405 --> 06:34.186
It's a phenomenon that's
being called "Towntime".

06:34.709 --> 06:37.312
The 2000s saw a huge
move to work from home,

06:37.337 --> 06:39.452
but people at home
basically eat and masturbate.

06:39.881 --> 06:42.312
So, Towntime calls for
a return to the office job,

06:42.313 --> 06:43.732
Monday morning, 9am.

06:45.274 --> 06:50.693
It's my honour to declare
the drone park officially open!

06:52.638 --> 06:54.966
Good luck! Bon voyage!

06:55.599 --> 06:57.013
Don't go to my house!

06:57.199 --> 06:58.199
I'm not in!

06:59.046 --> 07:03.200
As MP to the Northern Powerhouse,
I promise that for every job lost,

07:03.225 --> 07:04.536
there will be a job gained.

07:04.945 --> 07:07.979
This fleet of drones will
be the pride of Manchester.

07:08.324 --> 07:09.359
As you can see...

07:13.419 --> 07:16.130
Oh, my God! Have you just
seen? My MP's been decapitated!

07:16.348 --> 07:19.184
It's terrible news about Archie,

07:19.450 --> 07:21.911
but I can't help
feeling it's symbolic.

07:22.418 --> 07:24.823
I hereby declare, with
the greatest of respect,

07:24.856 --> 07:28.833
that I will be standing in the
by-election for his constituency.

07:28.932 --> 07:30.019
Seriously?

07:30.755 --> 07:33.020
I'm watching her now, Viv Rook.

07:33.045 --> 07:34.558
So, she's going to be my MP?

07:34.583 --> 07:36.573
No, she isn't. I told you.

07:36.598 --> 07:38.550
Don't you dare vote for her.

07:38.731 --> 07:40.856
I will give you
money not to vote.

07:40.947 --> 07:42.723
All right, then. That's a deal.

07:42.995 --> 07:44.903
Right, got to go.
Pay me in cash. Bye!

07:45.770 --> 07:48.200
You know she owns
us, don't you? Viv Rook?

07:49.104 --> 07:51.676
Now they've privatised housing,
we're part of Stonerock Holdings.

07:51.770 --> 07:53.044
And on the board...

07:56.689 --> 07:58.471
Oh, my God, she's my boss!

07:59.112 --> 08:00.924
This is my chance at last...

08:02.038 --> 08:05.049
to honour my
country and to serve it.

08:10.412 --> 08:12.958
Your greenhouse,
it's not very safe.

08:14.062 --> 08:16.333
People have been
saying that for years.

08:16.841 --> 08:18.693
I got a man in to look at it,

08:18.718 --> 08:20.568
but part of it fell on his head.

08:20.637 --> 08:21.966
He never came back.

08:22.263 --> 08:23.607
You should be careful, though.

08:23.872 --> 08:27.513
Viktor, all of the money in
this house was my father's.

08:28.419 --> 08:31.279
And he lost it in 1976.

08:31.654 --> 08:34.865
We haven't been able to
afford this place ever since.

08:35.763 --> 08:38.255
Let it rot gently.

08:38.947 --> 08:40.184
I'll survive.

08:41.482 --> 08:44.544
Dan said about your parents...

08:45.458 --> 08:49.997
Yeah... They reported
you to the police.

08:51.173 --> 08:52.893
In fairness, they
thought it was their duty.

08:53.765 --> 08:54.765
They're Christians.

08:55.466 --> 08:56.935
I mean, it genuinely hurts them.

08:57.331 --> 08:58.826
Do you forgive them?

09:00.142 --> 09:01.169
I have to try.

09:01.397 --> 09:02.401
Rubbish.

09:03.513 --> 09:04.810
They're disgusting.

09:05.237 --> 09:08.935
Your mother and father are
disgusting people. Is that clear?

09:09.818 --> 09:11.896
I'm not without
prejudice myself.

09:11.955 --> 09:13.521
I don't like Londoners.

09:14.615 --> 09:17.818
And I don't like people who
wear sunglasses indoors.

09:18.405 --> 09:19.409
But you...

09:20.338 --> 09:21.974
you're beautiful,

09:22.339 --> 09:25.957
in the eyes of Christ
and in the eyes of myself.

09:27.403 --> 09:29.504
Is that clear?
Have you got that?

09:30.213 --> 09:31.213
Yes.

09:31.352 --> 09:35.404
And you're very welcome
here for the rest of your life.

09:37.646 --> 09:39.795
Oh, don't cry!

09:40.482 --> 09:42.466
You're not going to
get a hug or anything.

09:44.631 --> 09:45.631
Thank you.

09:46.228 --> 09:48.302
I thought this would be
nice just the two of us.

09:48.537 --> 09:50.787
Hey, now that you're working,
we can be ladies who lunch.

09:51.310 --> 09:53.771
- That's great. Thanks very much.
- Can I take a drinks order?

09:54.779 --> 09:56.819
We'll just have a look.
Give us a couple of minutes?

10:00.779 --> 10:03.670
I want you to explain. Your
dad said you offered to pay rent,

10:03.695 --> 10:05.584
but there really is
no need, honestly.

10:06.035 --> 10:07.920
I've got work until the autumn.

10:08.091 --> 10:10.185
Height of Essence isn't
pulling out until October,

10:10.210 --> 10:11.685
so there's no emergency.

10:12.165 --> 10:15.263
We won't starve.
And after that...

10:15.521 --> 10:18.623
Well... Well, maybe
you can give me advice.

10:19.134 --> 10:22.818
When I went to university, they
said accountancy was a job for life.

10:23.122 --> 10:24.896
But now, thanks to your lot,

10:25.141 --> 10:27.857
artificial intelligence can
do my job in one second flat.

10:28.204 --> 10:32.246
I'm going to be quite literally
redundant in every way.

10:32.614 --> 10:34.426
- Will you call me?
- Sorry?

10:34.637 --> 10:36.417
- Will you call me?
- You mean telephone you?

10:36.442 --> 10:37.457
- Yes.
- When?

10:37.467 --> 10:38.467
Now.

10:38.492 --> 10:41.253
- But you're sitting right here.
- This is why I wanted to have lunch.

10:41.399 --> 10:43.293
Will you just phone me? Now?

10:50.129 --> 10:52.105
- Hello, Bethany speaking.
- Hello.

10:52.519 --> 10:54.777
- Are you phoning for Bethany?
- Yes.

10:54.847 --> 10:57.160
- What are you doing?
- This is Bethany. Can you hear me?

10:57.219 --> 10:58.534
Well, you're right
in front of me.

10:58.558 --> 11:00.168
But can you hear
me down the phone?

11:03.628 --> 11:04.628
Oh, my gosh!

11:05.000 --> 11:06.995
This is me, on the phone.

11:07.020 --> 11:09.965
I had it implanted.
My hand is the phone.

11:10.605 --> 11:12.480
I can walk, and talk,

11:12.566 --> 11:15.285
'cos I'm on the phone,
the phone inside my hand.

11:15.855 --> 11:17.152
I am the phone.

11:17.808 --> 11:19.688
This is what phones are
going to be from now on.

11:20.325 --> 11:21.887
I have integrated.

11:23.321 --> 11:24.738
Thank you for your call.

11:31.394 --> 11:32.730
Subdermal implants.

11:33.371 --> 11:36.176
They charge themselves with
motion like a self-winding watch.

11:36.306 --> 11:37.793
And it's on the 22 network.

11:38.034 --> 11:41.503
I get signal across 95% of
UK mainland, 98 by next year.

11:41.581 --> 11:43.720
When I phoned
you, it was ringing.

11:43.745 --> 11:45.042
You were ringing.

11:45.067 --> 11:46.142
That's the speaker.

11:46.784 --> 11:48.737
- So small!
- Okay, but...

11:49.229 --> 11:50.518
When did you get this done?

11:50.620 --> 11:54.319
That course in Winchester? I
had one finger done every night.

11:54.320 --> 11:56.643
I still need to choose a
handset, to phone out. Look.

12:00.981 --> 12:01.981
Hello?

12:02.261 --> 12:03.261
Hi!

12:04.155 --> 12:08.353
Okay. But, look, I can't believe
you had surgery without telling me!

12:08.378 --> 12:10.704
Skinplants, not surgery.

12:10.729 --> 12:12.128
And I knew you'd be cross.

12:12.425 --> 12:14.673
But I'm 18, and you had
that tattoo when you were 18,

12:14.698 --> 12:16.206
and it's the same sort of thing.

12:17.010 --> 12:18.636
And I wanted to ask you...

12:20.151 --> 12:22.425
- Will you do me a favour?
- What?

12:24.401 --> 12:26.319
- Will you tell Dad?
- Oh, sweet...

12:26.320 --> 12:28.104
Please, will you
tell Dad for me?

12:42.328 --> 12:43.352
Good evening.

12:45.112 --> 12:46.112
Good evening, sir.

12:46.881 --> 12:49.760
Can I get a litre of
non milk? Thanks.

12:53.455 --> 12:55.080
- Anything else?
- Er...

12:56.017 --> 12:57.291
Thought a shag might be nice.

12:57.517 --> 12:58.900
Nothing I can
do about that, sir.

12:59.013 --> 13:00.013
Oh!

13:00.728 --> 13:02.986
Well, I'll just go
home all alone, then.

13:03.202 --> 13:05.822
Well, you're a bit ugly, sir.

13:07.830 --> 13:10.158
- I am.
- It's very sad.

13:10.843 --> 13:11.843
Goodnight, sir.

13:13.308 --> 13:14.324
Goodnight.

13:24.946 --> 13:27.439
All right... What
are you doing? Ah!

13:27.464 --> 13:29.236
Get off! Get off!

13:29.261 --> 13:30.994
- Yeah. Go on, go on, go on.
- You want it?

13:31.128 --> 13:33.443
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

13:39.994 --> 13:43.485
And next month, it will be
one year since Hong Sha Dao,

13:43.970 --> 13:46.326
and the shock waves
continue around the world,

13:46.327 --> 13:49.363
with instability still
rocking the banking system.

14:03.274 --> 14:04.469
Thanks, but I'm not stopping.

14:04.602 --> 14:07.837
I haven't got long. I'm supposed
to be on lunch duty, so...

14:08.000 --> 14:09.004
Well, there it is.

14:10.321 --> 14:13.876
Yeah. Didn't even miss
it. It only cost 20 quid, that.

14:13.901 --> 14:16.484
You're the only man I know
with ten different watches.

14:16.509 --> 14:18.949
- You don't wear the same shirt...
- all the time, do you?

14:22.145 --> 14:23.751
So how are things? Okay?

14:24.709 --> 14:27.071
Yeah, not bad. Nice and busy.

14:28.938 --> 14:31.829
What about you? Hm?
How is he? The boy?

14:32.231 --> 14:34.126
He's only six years younger.

14:34.151 --> 14:36.298
- That is so hot!
- Oh, stop it.

14:43.294 --> 14:46.305
I just thought if you
could sign those papers.

14:46.306 --> 14:48.341
We're trying to get Viktor
this Leave to Remain thing.

14:48.342 --> 14:50.293
And if I'm divorced,
it might help.

14:50.294 --> 14:53.313
- I was honestly bringing you the watch...
- Dan!

14:53.314 --> 14:57.321
You shat on me in front
of everyone. Remember?

14:57.322 --> 15:00.334
So I don't have the slightest
wish to stay married to you, OK?

15:01.346 --> 15:02.358
I'll sign it.

15:04.290 --> 15:05.341
Sorry.

15:10.515 --> 15:11.788
It's almost a year ago now.

15:11.813 --> 15:13.038
Well, two weeks' time.

15:14.066 --> 15:16.218
Gran's still
insisting on a party.

15:16.341 --> 15:17.804
That's one thing I won't miss.

15:18.249 --> 15:20.389
Standing there
freezing politely.

15:20.781 --> 15:23.506
I keep telling her, it's not
just her birthday weekend now,

15:23.531 --> 15:26.101
it's commemorating 40,000 dead.

15:26.337 --> 15:27.921
- And it's a barbecue.
- Yeah, I know.

15:34.835 --> 15:36.663
So what's the status
now then, hmm?

15:36.925 --> 15:39.320
Viktor. My name is Viktor.

15:41.147 --> 15:43.729
Still classified as an asylum
seeker. That hasn't changed.

15:44.007 --> 15:45.607
What, and he's
allowed to live with you?

15:45.835 --> 15:46.835
Yep.

15:48.085 --> 15:49.101
Mm-hm.

15:50.219 --> 15:52.975
The house is a mess
now. It would drive you mad.

15:54.143 --> 15:55.569
Viktor!

15:58.389 --> 16:00.273
It's still tough. He's not
allowed a job or anything.

16:00.297 --> 16:03.296
I mean, he's working part
time to stop him going mad,

16:03.321 --> 16:04.585
but it's all cash in hand.

16:04.718 --> 16:06.614
He's got a degree in economics,

16:06.639 --> 16:08.694
but he's stuck working
in the petrol station.

16:10.506 --> 16:11.538
I tell you what, though.

16:11.843 --> 16:13.243
Do you know what
the good thing is?

16:14.701 --> 16:16.810
He gets free pasties
when the sell-by date is up.

16:16.960 --> 16:19.232
- They give them away!
- Oh, you love pasties.

16:19.257 --> 16:22.717
I do! I get free pasties.

16:27.077 --> 16:30.490
Well, look. Um, I
am glad you're happy.

16:32.764 --> 16:33.831
Thank you.

16:34.152 --> 16:35.357
Really, I am.

16:37.817 --> 16:38.821
Thanks.

16:48.201 --> 16:52.068
Hiya. Sorry, my app's frozen.
It's pump number two. Thanks.

16:52.265 --> 16:53.289
Uh-huh.

16:55.387 --> 16:57.428
£120. Thank you.

17:00.042 --> 17:01.191
Anything else, sir?

17:01.344 --> 17:02.902
No, that's everything. Thanks.

17:24.076 --> 17:27.075
This weekend will be marked by
services up and down the country

17:27.099 --> 17:30.987
to remember Hong Sha Dao on
the first anniversary of the explosion.

17:31.370 --> 17:33.877
And American embassies
have been surrounded by crowds

17:33.902 --> 17:36.893
protesting at the events
of this time last year.

17:36.978 --> 17:39.588
Campaigning will be
suspended for the day.

17:41.252 --> 17:42.838
My thoughts and prayers

17:43.319 --> 17:44.893
are with Beijing.

17:46.853 --> 17:49.026
Hey! Happy Birthday.

17:49.228 --> 17:50.751
Although technically
it's not till tomorrow,

17:50.775 --> 17:52.855
so if you don't survive
the night, I'll have it back!

17:53.627 --> 17:57.696
Now then, sweetheart, if your
mum and dad want to move house,

17:57.721 --> 17:59.971
you can always come
and live here, can't you?

18:00.033 --> 18:01.737
Who loves you? I do.

18:01.908 --> 18:03.956
Oh, well, that helps
enormously. Well done.

18:05.053 --> 18:06.596
Happy birthday, Muriel.

18:06.868 --> 18:08.518
Did you hear,
Bethany got promoted?

18:08.543 --> 18:10.103
- I didn't know that.
- Isn't that good?

18:10.378 --> 18:13.105
Marvellous,
whatever that job is.

18:13.193 --> 18:14.293
She's data mining.

18:14.535 --> 18:17.027
Yeah, I know what it is,
but I don't know what it is!

18:17.052 --> 18:18.350
I have a rule.

18:18.769 --> 18:21.214
No-one is allowed to
stare at my daughter's hand.

18:21.332 --> 18:23.582
Beth, show me your hand.
Right. Hand down again.

18:23.644 --> 18:25.894
That's it's. I've had
enough of people staring.

18:26.227 --> 18:28.160
It turns out the calls
are twice the price.

18:28.185 --> 18:29.316
You didn't ask about that.

18:30.409 --> 18:31.769
Where's Rosie?
She's not here yet?

18:31.899 --> 18:34.987
She said she'd be late.
Lincoln had a bit of a tum.

18:35.417 --> 18:38.870
Now I looked and looked
and looked for chocolate,

18:39.012 --> 18:41.099
but you just can't
find it any more.

18:41.768 --> 18:45.026
I thought, this year, no TV.

18:45.448 --> 18:47.333
Even when the boys arrive.

18:47.659 --> 18:52.643
TV off, because that thing
scared us to death last year.

18:53.048 --> 18:55.768
I mean, let's be
honest, it was terrifying.

18:56.200 --> 18:58.752
I actually thought I
could see you all perish.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.877
My own family,
right in front of me...

19:02.635 --> 19:06.534
so I might have said
some silly things.

19:08.334 --> 19:11.043
I know I did and I'm sorry.

19:11.357 --> 19:12.770
I'm sorry too.

19:21.161 --> 19:25.707
Well, now, maybe you won't
need to stay away for a whole year.

19:26.536 --> 19:27.926
We didn't do it on purpose.

19:28.036 --> 19:29.395
Been busy, that's all.

19:29.524 --> 19:32.379
Oh. Stephen said not so busy.

19:34.434 --> 19:36.934
What about the house?
Is there any news?

19:37.274 --> 19:40.949
Um, that Mr Yamagata liked it,
so I think we've found a buyer.

19:41.258 --> 19:43.619
Hey, I was going to ask, do you
think I should move my money

19:43.644 --> 19:45.160
with all this fuss
about the banks?

19:45.185 --> 19:47.192
Er, financial advice off
me costs £300 an hour,

19:47.217 --> 19:48.268
thank you very much.

19:48.622 --> 19:51.140
Nah, you should be all right. You
haven't got 85 grand, have you?

19:51.164 --> 19:52.171
God, no.

19:52.305 --> 19:53.324
That'd be nice.

19:53.349 --> 19:55.849
Anything less than 85, you're
insured by the government.

19:56.167 --> 19:57.783
- You should be fine.
- I said that'd be nice,

19:57.807 --> 19:59.287
not because I want
him for his money.

19:59.682 --> 20:02.307
Just the sex. Endless sex.

20:02.487 --> 20:04.571
- Thank you.
- Once you've been loved by a Lyons.

20:04.596 --> 20:05.706
Oh, my God!

20:06.495 --> 20:08.190
Is it bad, though,
for the banks?

20:08.369 --> 20:10.329
It's these sanctions against
America. It's ridiculous.

20:10.353 --> 20:12.791
Might as well take out
sanctions against ourselves.

20:13.369 --> 20:16.908
We are American. Our business is
American, our culture's American.

20:17.144 --> 20:18.624
We're certainly not
European, are we?

20:19.514 --> 20:20.514
Oh.

20:20.807 --> 20:22.822
Oh. Here we go, Gran.

20:22.894 --> 20:25.296
- That's Rosie.
- Right now, Muriel. Put that down.

20:25.321 --> 20:27.308
Let's go out and
see her. Come on.

20:27.965 --> 20:30.729
She knows her way in.
She's here every week.

20:31.102 --> 20:33.302
- Come on! Let's go and say hello.
- Let's go, let's go.

20:35.957 --> 20:38.581
- Hi, Gran!
- Hello.

20:39.120 --> 20:40.320
Here we are, then.

20:40.345 --> 20:41.565
Surprise!

20:44.698 --> 20:45.709
Oh!

20:45.734 --> 20:46.734
Aw!

20:47.301 --> 20:51.174
Oh, you silly girl!

20:51.199 --> 20:52.471
Oh!

20:53.499 --> 20:55.947
Your mother should be here.

20:57.534 --> 20:58.947
Careful, she's radioactive!

21:05.553 --> 21:06.588
All right.

21:11.194 --> 21:14.241
We can't just have any old
barbecue, not with Edith home.

21:14.587 --> 21:18.299
- Let's make it nice and special.
- Oh, 'cos Edith's special.

21:18.324 --> 21:20.657
- She's so special.
- We are just dirt.

21:20.682 --> 21:23.327
I love Edith more than
anything in the world don't you?

21:23.609 --> 21:25.416
You'll get a clip in a minute.

21:27.267 --> 21:30.666
Seven years. It's been ages.
Does it feel weird being back?

21:30.806 --> 21:31.955
Little bit, yeah.

21:32.920 --> 21:33.995
Viktor's nice.

21:34.676 --> 21:35.676
Sexy!

21:36.494 --> 21:39.150
Bethany's a bit odd. You
know she wants be a robot.

21:39.284 --> 21:42.383
Mmm. Am I all right,
staying at yours?

21:42.525 --> 21:44.096
'Cos Gran says I can stay here.

21:44.121 --> 21:46.132
Oh, my God! You'd
die in this place.

21:46.157 --> 21:48.252
Course you can. You
can get to know the boys.

21:48.795 --> 21:50.689
- How long for?
- Dunno.

21:51.541 --> 21:52.869
Not sailing off on a mission?

21:52.894 --> 21:57.829
Er, yeah. It's all gone
a bit sour. It's so stupid.

21:58.194 --> 22:00.829
It's that footage we
took at Hong Sha.

22:00.854 --> 22:02.486
People think we sold
it for lots of money.

22:02.510 --> 22:04.298
Do they? That's terrible.

22:04.470 --> 22:07.860
Ah. Trouble is, some people
on the boat think we should,

22:07.885 --> 22:10.001
so I might just step
away and have a think.

22:11.045 --> 22:14.712
And it's weird. You
know this radiation... thing.

22:15.997 --> 22:18.004
- You feeling all right, though?
- Yeah.

22:18.548 --> 22:20.195
But one day, the
clock's ticking,

22:20.220 --> 22:22.318
maybe it's time I did something
with my life instead of shouting.

22:22.319 --> 22:24.368
Just... not sure what.

22:25.438 --> 22:28.196
So come on, Edith. Tell
me stories of the high seas.

22:28.221 --> 22:30.516
What's the best place
you think you've been?

22:30.541 --> 22:32.062
Oh, don't do that!

22:32.087 --> 22:33.487
It's a bit like an
interview, Gran.

22:33.626 --> 22:36.649
Well, I don't know where to start.
You've been away for so long.

22:36.759 --> 22:39.962
You see online? The North
Pole melted. Like, it's gone.

22:40.704 --> 22:44.235
- You should tell people about that.
- Well, yes, I could but I did.

22:44.299 --> 22:45.579
There's not much point any more.

22:45.994 --> 22:47.211
Oh, don't say that.

22:47.430 --> 22:49.485
No, but really, no, like,

22:49.937 --> 22:52.608
we keep saying you've got ten
more years to sort out climate change,

22:52.632 --> 22:54.318
you've got ten more
years to sort out flooding,

22:54.319 --> 22:56.334
you've got ten more years
to sort out the rainforest.

22:56.335 --> 22:58.670
We've been saying that
for 30 years. But it's too late.

22:58.695 --> 23:00.295
We've run out of time.
Everyone knows it.

23:00.339 --> 23:04.841
You can recycle and
campaign and go on marches.

23:04.866 --> 23:09.420
We are going to flood
and burn and starve.

23:10.310 --> 23:13.059
And we won't die. I'm not saying
that the human race is gonna

23:13.084 --> 23:15.927
carry on, living on plateaus.

23:17.638 --> 23:21.059
Like shepherds, little villages,
maybe with a computer in a hut,

23:21.575 --> 23:23.997
you can go and visit once
a week, and then go back

23:24.094 --> 23:26.825
to growing your
little patch of corn.

23:27.090 --> 23:30.730
You might be digging out some
rocks and singing Elvis to yourself,

23:30.755 --> 23:32.770
or the Beatles, but you won't
know who they are any more.

23:32.794 --> 23:34.911
Just folk songs from long ago.

23:37.117 --> 23:38.273
So nice to have you back.

23:38.928 --> 23:40.676
Edith! Don't listen, kids.

23:41.442 --> 23:42.989
I'm saying, let's have fun.

23:43.278 --> 23:45.122
Sod it. Enjoy it now.

23:45.147 --> 23:46.895
'Cos... I...

23:47.392 --> 23:49.844
got... this...

23:51.125 --> 23:52.639
in Japan!

23:52.664 --> 23:55.337
Slightly under the counter
it's that new synthetic alcohol.

23:55.362 --> 23:58.358
Oh, my God! It's
supposed to be lethal.

23:58.383 --> 23:59.702
Yeah, but that's the point.

23:59.727 --> 24:01.525
That it's designed to cut
out all the by-products,

24:01.549 --> 24:04.336
so you just get completely
plastered with no hangover.

24:04.719 --> 24:06.641
- Does it work?
- Well, Celeste,

24:06.666 --> 24:08.024
there's only one
way to find out!

25:46.324 --> 25:48.137
I think that alcohol
needs a bit of work.

25:52.080 --> 25:54.895
I looked it up like,
the wind direction

25:55.520 --> 25:57.137
in the days after Hong Sha,

25:57.889 --> 26:00.567
and your angle of approach,
fallout patterns, and things.

26:04.994 --> 26:06.809
I think you got a bigger
dose than you said.

26:11.863 --> 26:13.504
I think you might
have ten years.

26:22.745 --> 26:24.254
Did you know you
can live forever?

26:35.456 --> 26:37.191
That's right, darling.

26:37.480 --> 26:38.925
What's he saying?

26:45.958 --> 26:48.334
Ooh, no, no! You'll drop it.

26:48.359 --> 26:49.870
It... Give it here.

26:50.831 --> 26:52.066
Don't move.

26:52.647 --> 26:53.753
Stay there.

26:54.706 --> 26:55.710
Oh!

26:57.394 --> 26:59.034
Well, that's got to be fake.

26:59.315 --> 27:00.706
Fake news.

27:01.146 --> 27:02.667
Bang on midnight.

27:03.009 --> 27:05.347
"Message from the Home Office."

27:05.464 --> 27:07.097
As if they'd text.

27:07.347 --> 27:12.089
"Our records show you may not
have leave to remain in the UK."

27:12.612 --> 27:15.214
You should tell your
friends that's not funny.

27:17.017 --> 27:18.628
Black coffee, I think.

27:19.201 --> 27:22.262
I'll see you next
week. And take care.

27:22.295 --> 27:24.191
I'm not sure
you're fit to drive.

27:24.216 --> 27:28.526
The focus group can officially
declare alcosynth does not work!

27:30.542 --> 27:32.352
Oh, God, I feel bad!

27:32.964 --> 27:34.698
And sort out that text.

27:34.962 --> 27:38.454
Tell them it should be illegal using
the words Home Office like that.

27:38.479 --> 27:39.760
Will do. See you, Gran.

27:47.973 --> 27:49.486
- I think it's real.
- Yeah.

27:51.322 --> 27:52.346
I looked online.

27:52.800 --> 27:54.705
There's many people
saying text at midnight.

27:55.173 --> 27:57.986
Well, we've been privatised with
the same system date changes

27:58.011 --> 28:00.399
at midnight,
automated texts go ping.

28:00.478 --> 28:01.482
It's real.

28:03.216 --> 28:04.216
Don't worry.

28:04.805 --> 28:05.961
I'll phone Yvonne.

28:07.430 --> 28:09.577
Honestly, I'm fine.

28:09.602 --> 28:11.452
Don't go to any fuss. I
can sleep on a settee.

28:11.477 --> 28:14.325
No, there's plenty of
space, 'cos Lincoln, if you put

28:14.326 --> 28:16.345
your things in Lee's room,
then you two can share

28:16.346 --> 28:18.305
and if you're
really, really good,

28:18.754 --> 28:21.274
we could get bunk beds.
I'm having the top bunk!

28:21.516 --> 28:23.596
Right, go and put your
clothes in that bottom drawer.

28:23.957 --> 28:26.532
Lee, go and make
some room, five minutes.

28:27.203 --> 28:28.480
Why do kids love bunk beds?

28:28.505 --> 28:30.275
Knock knock! Only me.

28:30.314 --> 28:32.160
Careful, got sore heads.

28:32.393 --> 28:34.277
My sister tried to
poison us last night.

28:34.696 --> 28:36.678
This is Edith. This is
Lesley from down the hall.

28:36.703 --> 28:38.850
- Ah, the missing sister.
- Hello.

28:38.875 --> 28:40.172
Aren't you supposed to be dying?

28:41.146 --> 28:44.149
Well, I mean, aren't
we all, in the end?

28:44.174 --> 28:45.430
Well, you look good on it!

28:45.827 --> 28:47.272
I just got that coupon.

28:47.429 --> 28:48.671
It's good till Friday.

28:49.007 --> 28:50.999
I can't stop. I'm on the 3.15.

28:51.024 --> 28:52.288
See you tonight, though, yeah?

28:52.313 --> 28:53.530
Yeah. And that's Poppy.

28:54.054 --> 28:55.960
She's six months
old, aren't you, Poppy?

28:55.985 --> 28:56.985
Hello! Hello.

28:57.939 --> 28:58.990
I'll leave you to it.

28:59.196 --> 29:01.132
Good luck. Hope you don't die.

29:01.348 --> 29:02.983
Thanks! I'll do my best.

29:05.593 --> 29:06.921
That was her. That's Poppy.

29:07.089 --> 29:08.819
- What do you mean?
- I told you. Poppy...

29:09.101 --> 29:10.607
Don't you read
any of your e-mails?

29:10.632 --> 29:12.827
The little girl. The
Poppy. That was her.

29:13.663 --> 29:17.364
So they did a scan and Poppy
had a gap in her spine, just like me,

29:17.803 --> 29:20.132
- so they went in and fixed it.
- In the womb?

29:20.157 --> 29:21.350
Yeah. It's amazing, isn't it?

29:21.476 --> 29:22.500
They've been
doing that for years

29:22.524 --> 29:24.624
but now they can
grow the nerve tissue.

29:24.698 --> 29:27.741
They can cultivate it
inside and fix it completely.

29:28.365 --> 29:30.561
I mean, she's only six
months, we'll see how it goes,

29:30.586 --> 29:32.161
but really, that's it...

29:32.274 --> 29:35.445
spina bifida cured, almost.

29:36.050 --> 29:38.718
And is that... okay?

29:39.321 --> 29:41.921
It's brilliant. I mean, look
at her. She's gorgeous.

29:42.399 --> 29:45.226
But she was gorgeous before.

29:46.515 --> 29:47.773
Gives me the shivers a bit.

29:48.155 --> 29:52.289
Can't say that to Lesley, 'cos
once they start fixing people,

29:52.990 --> 29:56.032
where do they stop?
Too tall? Too short?

29:56.409 --> 29:57.647
Do they want to fix me?

29:58.670 --> 30:00.850
I think I'm brilliant.
I don't want fixing.

30:03.238 --> 30:04.420
How much did it cost?

30:05.678 --> 30:06.794
Well, that's the thing.

30:06.819 --> 30:08.561
She was on the
programme, so it was free.

30:09.077 --> 30:11.452
But the NHS can't
afford stuff like that.

30:12.018 --> 30:13.569
So who's going to get fixed?

30:14.120 --> 30:15.460
Only the billionaires.

30:16.894 --> 30:17.894
So...

30:19.060 --> 30:21.677
you're worried about people
you don't like, buying something

30:21.702 --> 30:22.702
you don't want.

30:23.686 --> 30:26.655
Yeah, I think. Is that right?

30:27.358 --> 30:28.397
I don't know.

30:29.332 --> 30:31.336
God, the world got complicated!

30:35.304 --> 30:36.678
Hester Babatunde?

30:40.295 --> 30:43.067
The phrase to watch
out for is "live discreetly".

30:43.159 --> 30:45.708
Technically, homosexuality
isn't illegal in Ukraine,

30:45.733 --> 30:48.307
so if they say you can live
discreetly, they can say you're safe

30:48.308 --> 30:49.327
to be returned.

30:49.662 --> 30:51.967
You mean, I should be
not discreet with this?

30:51.992 --> 30:53.029
Indiscreet.

30:53.483 --> 30:56.287
It's not the gay thing. You
got out because they registered

30:56.288 --> 30:58.045
- him as a dissident.
- Unofficially.

30:58.070 --> 31:00.110
We can't prove that, so
I'm going to use everything.

31:01.312 --> 31:02.373
I could wear a dress!

31:02.817 --> 31:03.817
That would help!

31:04.763 --> 31:05.849
Viktor Goraya?

31:06.502 --> 31:08.189
- Right.
- You got everything?

31:08.627 --> 31:09.627
Yep.

31:11.217 --> 31:12.241
Good luck.

31:56.353 --> 31:58.111
They've detained him. I'm sorry.

31:58.136 --> 32:00.971
I need to get back to the office. I
can make an appeal by six o'clock.

32:01.130 --> 32:03.161
- Sorry, where is he?
- He's been detained.

32:03.619 --> 32:05.774
Right, so where is he now?

32:05.799 --> 32:07.979
Back there in a holding room
but then they're going to move him.

32:08.003 --> 32:10.236
What do you mean, detained?
Detained for how long?

32:10.261 --> 32:12.962
Well, he's been detained that's
it. That's why I need to get back.

32:12.987 --> 32:15.908
- You mean he's been arrested?
- Well, no. But in effect, yes.

32:15.933 --> 32:17.285
What happened? They did what?

32:17.924 --> 32:19.806
They say he's been working
at a petrol station for money,

32:19.830 --> 32:21.088
so he's broken his conditions.

32:21.113 --> 32:22.551
I'm not even going to
ask you if that's true.

32:22.575 --> 32:23.643
I'm just going back to work.

32:23.667 --> 32:24.980
Okay, so where is he now?

32:25.005 --> 32:27.282
He's in a holding room, but then
they're taking him to Three Bridges.

32:27.306 --> 32:28.783
- That's near Gatwick.
- Taking him away?

32:28.807 --> 32:29.807
- Yeah.
- Where to?

32:29.832 --> 32:31.572
It's a centre called the
Three Bridges, near Gatwick.

32:31.596 --> 32:33.496
Right, okay, so, well
can I see him now?

32:33.723 --> 32:35.301
He hasn't gone already,
has he? Can I see him?

32:35.302 --> 32:37.603
- They won't allow it.
- But I work for the council.

32:37.760 --> 32:40.003
I'm not just anyone. I'm in
housing, I move people all the time.

32:40.027 --> 32:42.072
I know the system.
I'm allowed to see him.

32:42.097 --> 32:44.867
Daniel, you can't. Listen to
me. Trust me. Don't piss them off.

32:44.892 --> 32:46.939
Okay, so what happens?
What are they going to do?

32:46.964 --> 32:49.124
- They want to deport him.
- No, but they tortured him.

32:49.942 --> 32:53.205
You know, in the
Ukraine they tortured him.

32:53.769 --> 32:55.767
So where is he?

32:55.830 --> 32:58.120
They're taking him to a place
called the Three Bridges Centre,

32:58.144 --> 32:59.144
in London.

32:59.169 --> 33:01.580
It's just outside Gatwick.
They're taking his phone off him.

33:01.605 --> 33:02.644
But that's not legal.

33:02.669 --> 33:04.879
They can remove the phone if it
has a camera or internet access...

33:04.903 --> 33:05.998
which is every
phone in the world.

33:06.022 --> 33:07.670
Who's got his phone? How are
they allowed to have his phone?

33:07.694 --> 33:10.013
That phone belongs to him, so
who's got it right now? Where is it?

33:10.037 --> 33:11.598
I need to get
back to the office.

33:13.249 --> 33:14.288
He's going where?

33:15.051 --> 33:19.192
Three Bridges. It's a centre
like Yarl's Wood, near Gatwick.

33:20.031 --> 33:22.300
He's on his way
now. It's ridiculous.

33:22.325 --> 33:23.328
I've got it here.

33:23.636 --> 33:25.863
It says, "Three Bridges
is a removal centre."

33:26.761 --> 33:28.361
- Does that mean...?
- It's near Gatwick.

33:28.497 --> 33:30.159
You go there to be removed.

33:31.690 --> 33:33.328
They can't deport
someone in a single day.

33:33.329 --> 33:35.667
Oh, oh, your little world.

33:36.215 --> 33:39.979
He's not that far from you. I'll be
there by half six. Get us a pizza.

33:40.960 --> 33:42.495
We should be moving
in a month or so.

33:43.511 --> 33:45.332
The first man came
back, Mr Yamagata.

33:45.333 --> 33:48.642
He offered the asking price,
so off we go. Oh, except Ruby.

33:48.667 --> 33:50.534
I'm not moving. I'm really not.

33:50.776 --> 33:52.362
Pizza with lemon does not work.

33:52.737 --> 33:55.704
That house in Chancellor Row
fell through, so we might have to

33:55.729 --> 33:58.971
rent for a couple of months,
which is a bit of a hassle, but...

34:00.077 --> 34:01.321
gives me time to look for work.

34:01.345 --> 34:02.589
How much did this place go for?

34:03.340 --> 34:04.893
2.6 million.

34:05.516 --> 34:07.612
Oh, my God!

34:07.960 --> 34:08.964
London!

34:13.745 --> 34:16.571
Hold on. Hold on, hold on, hold
on, hold on, hold on, on, on. Hold on.

34:16.596 --> 34:18.065
Hello? Hello?

34:18.425 --> 34:20.721
Hey! Guess where I am.

34:21.011 --> 34:25.011
I know where you are. I'm like a
world expert on Three Bridges now.

34:25.158 --> 34:26.158
You okay?

34:26.183 --> 34:27.322
Whose phone is this?

34:27.603 --> 34:30.876
They give you a phone with £10
credit. Not allowed my old one.

34:30.900 --> 34:33.301
No, I know, I know. But what's
happened to your proper phone?

34:33.431 --> 34:35.570
Who's got it? Did they
take it? Did they bag it?

34:35.594 --> 34:37.782
Did they give you a receipt?
Because that's really not their property.

34:37.806 --> 34:40.431
- Do you know where it is?
- I don't really care about the phone.

34:41.830 --> 34:42.830
No.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.083
You okay?

34:46.760 --> 34:47.819
Yeah.

34:48.328 --> 34:49.688
I didn't even say goodbye.

34:51.197 --> 34:53.476
So anyway, I'm down here
in London. I'm not far away.

34:53.501 --> 34:54.812
I'm staying with Stephen.

34:54.837 --> 34:57.298
I've got your clothes.
Just shoved them in.

34:57.852 --> 35:00.133
First thing tomorrow, I'll make
an appointment to see you.

35:00.431 --> 35:03.447
- You can't.
- Well, tough because I can, and I will.

35:04.392 --> 35:06.837
It takes 24 hours to make an
appointment, and they're flying me

35:06.861 --> 35:07.900
out at 7.00am.

35:08.877 --> 35:09.932
It's 12 hours' time.

35:10.400 --> 35:11.962
No, Yvonne's put in an appeal.

35:12.034 --> 35:13.079
Doesn't matter.

35:13.932 --> 35:15.642
She's put in an appeal.

35:15.990 --> 35:17.197
That's the system now.

35:17.829 --> 35:20.009
They reverted the
law back to 2014.

35:20.775 --> 35:23.126
You get deported.
Then you can appeal.

35:23.548 --> 35:25.103
Well, they can't do that.

35:25.674 --> 35:27.837
Okay. Tell them.

35:34.942 --> 35:35.942
7.00am?

35:38.670 --> 35:39.670
Yeah.

35:42.486 --> 35:43.805
Where to, Kiev?

35:45.938 --> 35:48.008
- Yeah.
- Right, then.

35:49.610 --> 35:51.789
Well, you go, and then...

35:53.585 --> 35:54.914
I'll get you back.

35:58.895 --> 35:59.915
Yes, please.

36:12.880 --> 36:13.880
Hey.

36:15.158 --> 36:17.524
Hi there. Shut up. Go to sleep.

36:18.780 --> 36:20.946
- What's all this?
- Nothing.

36:22.309 --> 36:24.309
- Is the bed okay?
- It's fine.

36:25.725 --> 36:27.701
- Oh, were the boys making trouble?
- No.

36:30.398 --> 36:31.922
Is there something wrong?

36:32.154 --> 36:34.242
No, it's fine. Just...

36:36.247 --> 36:38.742
This is nice. That's all.

36:39.131 --> 36:41.539
Now sssh!

36:43.134 --> 36:44.555
Aw!

36:44.954 --> 36:46.679
- Aw!
- Shut up!

36:50.374 --> 36:51.913
I haven't done this for years.

36:52.467 --> 36:53.835
Remember that caravan?

36:55.028 --> 36:57.163
All the food went off.
Do you remember?

36:58.258 --> 36:59.702
Mum was livid!

37:00.591 --> 37:02.312
Happy days.

37:04.330 --> 37:05.334
Yeah.

37:07.043 --> 37:08.687
Night, then.

37:10.142 --> 37:11.190
Welcome home.

37:32.493 --> 37:33.513
Right.

37:38.410 --> 37:41.437
- What are you going to do?
- Go back home.

37:43.591 --> 37:44.765
Get him back.

38:08.289 --> 38:09.412
Hi there. You okay?

38:09.655 --> 38:12.459
Come outside quickly!
Come and look outside now.

38:12.569 --> 38:14.209
Danny said Viktor's
been flown out.

38:14.269 --> 38:16.834
He's phoned the Home Office
but just ended up talking to a clerk.

38:16.913 --> 38:19.194
Yes, yes, yes. Edith,
come outside now!

38:22.511 --> 38:24.796
I'm here. Can you see me?

38:27.077 --> 38:28.818
- What's all the fuss?
- Oh, my God.

38:28.843 --> 38:31.757
Wait till you see. Here
it comes. It's hilarious.

38:31.902 --> 38:32.925
Look.

38:33.160 --> 38:36.718
Look, it's the Battle Bus! It's the
Rookmobile! It's Vivienne Rook!

38:37.038 --> 38:39.585
Oh, my God. I've read about her.

38:39.772 --> 38:41.654
Yeah, she's on TV all
the time, you missed it!

38:41.679 --> 38:43.280
She's got her own
party, the Four Stars!

38:43.461 --> 38:46.432
Hello, Viv! Hello! Yes, woo!

38:46.858 --> 38:48.150
She sounds like a monster.

38:48.309 --> 38:50.349
Oh, I know, I wouldn't
vote for her. She's horrific.

38:50.483 --> 38:53.123
I read somewhere that she acts
all normal, but she's a millionaire.

38:53.408 --> 38:54.514
Go on, Viv! Whoo!

38:54.772 --> 38:56.929
Rosie, I don't think
she's actually on the bus.

38:57.058 --> 38:58.999
Yeah, I know. She won't
set foot in this place.

38:59.024 --> 39:00.600
Been Labour for 500 years.

39:00.956 --> 39:03.498
Mind you, nice to have a
woman, though. Go on, Viv!

39:03.821 --> 39:05.209
So who's he got out there?

39:05.234 --> 39:06.451
His mum and dad.

39:06.979 --> 39:08.271
But they're Eastern Orthodox,

39:08.709 --> 39:11.287
and when the Russians
occupied Ukraine, they named him

39:11.288 --> 39:12.638
to the police as gay.

39:12.810 --> 39:15.307
That's what people do
there. His own parents!

39:15.332 --> 39:16.332
I mean, he's got friends,

39:16.357 --> 39:17.589
but they're all too scared.

39:18.064 --> 39:19.870
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

39:19.895 --> 39:22.267
Oh! Here I am! I'm alive.

39:22.292 --> 39:23.667
I did it! I'm here.

39:23.814 --> 39:26.042
Are you all right?
What time is it there?

39:26.067 --> 39:28.675
- Where are you?
- I'm fine. I'm really fine.

39:28.700 --> 39:29.700
We're going.

39:29.725 --> 39:31.520
Don't mind us.
We'll leave you to it.

39:31.893 --> 39:34.440
Well done, Viktor.
He'll get you home.

39:34.465 --> 39:35.627
Hi there! Thank you.

39:35.652 --> 39:37.973
I'll come round later, yeah,
Fran? All right, all right.

39:37.998 --> 39:39.022
Right, bye-bye.

39:40.555 --> 39:42.301
Oh, my God.

39:43.737 --> 39:44.949
Look at your face!

39:47.069 --> 39:48.582
Where are you now? Where's that?

39:48.607 --> 39:50.832
Claude's. I'm
staying with Claude.

39:51.085 --> 39:54.551
He's there in the kitchen, just
to warn you. Do not whack it out!

39:55.981 --> 39:58.238
- I wasn't going to.
- Well, I would!

40:01.152 --> 40:04.496
You all right, though? I mean,
you're not under arrest, are you?

40:04.801 --> 40:06.934
No, it's fine, I promise.

40:07.205 --> 40:10.253
One good thing, Britain
deported 200 people in one day.

40:10.698 --> 40:12.159
55 to Kiev.

40:12.480 --> 40:13.920
So you know,
that's a lot of people.

40:14.487 --> 40:17.151
- It helps.
- But you're on a government list.

40:17.176 --> 40:19.214
I don't want to fight.
I just want to go.

40:19.868 --> 40:22.144
Till then, I will
do what they say.

40:22.169 --> 40:23.394
I will live discreetly.

40:24.646 --> 40:26.378
Live discreetly.

40:27.519 --> 40:28.761
Until I come home.

40:29.821 --> 40:31.394
I could fly out.

40:32.335 --> 40:34.401
- Is that discreet?
- I don't know.

40:35.072 --> 40:36.108
Is it?

40:37.323 --> 40:38.323
I don't know.

40:40.346 --> 40:41.346
God.

40:42.369 --> 40:44.831
Just for now, we
will be discreet.

40:46.573 --> 40:47.604
I love you.

40:48.358 --> 40:49.358
Yeah.

40:50.385 --> 40:51.405
I love you.

40:53.651 --> 40:55.261
But can they listen to this?

40:55.860 --> 40:56.892
I don't know.

41:08.899 --> 41:11.128
This is a different
country to the one I left.

41:11.472 --> 41:14.980
No-one used to care about
by-elections. It's gone mad.

41:15.005 --> 41:16.566
Yeah. We're all
bloody furious now.

41:16.591 --> 41:18.123
- What about?
- Everything.

41:18.963 --> 41:20.963
I'm not getting in
your way at home?

41:20.988 --> 41:23.206
Just 'cos you keep cleaning up after
me, like, every time I make a move,

41:23.230 --> 41:24.574
you're there,
cleaning, and I just...

41:24.598 --> 41:26.223
well, I just wondered if
you'd rather that I went.

41:26.247 --> 41:28.386
No, no. I love having
you there. It's just...

41:28.984 --> 41:31.309
Well, you know with Mum
when she was on chemo,

41:31.581 --> 41:32.948
the drugs are radioactive, so,

41:32.973 --> 41:35.105
"Don't touch any
urine, don't touch vomit,

41:35.130 --> 41:37.751
"don't touch any bodily
fluids" and it kind of got to me.

41:37.776 --> 41:41.151
I mean, I was with her all day,
every day, and I wore gloves,

41:41.176 --> 41:42.636
scrubbed everything, but...

41:43.399 --> 41:45.355
You're not radioactive, are you?

41:46.538 --> 41:48.065
No! No, I'm not.

41:48.090 --> 41:50.144
I just keep thinking of
the boys, you know, and...

41:50.730 --> 41:52.737
I wouldn't do that
to you, I swear.

41:53.278 --> 41:56.277
It doesn't work like that, anyway.
You get more radiation off rocks.

41:56.302 --> 41:57.317
Oh, my God!

42:02.836 --> 42:03.899
Go on, Vivienne!

42:04.442 --> 42:06.810
- Are you on her side now?
- No, I haven't made my mind up yet.

42:06.834 --> 42:08.426
Go on, Viv! Woo!

42:20.902 --> 42:24.044
I think that your party
has let us down, Stan,

42:24.069 --> 42:26.317
just like the Conservatives,
just like all of you,

42:26.761 --> 42:28.464
because Europe is punishing us.

42:28.675 --> 42:32.783
They're imposing embargoes,
export tariffs and border restrictions.

42:32.808 --> 42:35.304
We're fed up, and what
are you doing? Nothing.

42:35.305 --> 42:36.652
Export tariffs?

42:36.964 --> 42:39.861
- Yes.
- They impose export tariffs?

42:39.886 --> 42:41.004
It's a disgrace.

42:41.082 --> 42:42.738
What's an export tariff?

42:44.261 --> 42:45.580
I mean, tariffs in general.

42:45.605 --> 42:48.004
See, if they impose
an export tariff,

42:48.029 --> 42:50.808
then they would pay the
export tariff themselves.

42:50.866 --> 42:52.410
We don't pay. They do.

42:52.435 --> 42:53.886
Do you actually understand that?

42:55.566 --> 42:56.879
- No, but I...
- You see, I don't think

42:56.903 --> 42:58.792
you understand anything.

42:58.952 --> 43:02.276
This is very detailed
and precise information,

43:02.301 --> 43:04.175
and you don't even
begin to understand it.

43:04.730 --> 43:06.472
You're just saying
words, Mrs Rook.

43:12.331 --> 43:15.659
And now, closing remarks from
Vivian Rook, Four Star Party.

43:16.359 --> 43:19.862
Thank you. And thank
you to my fellow candidates.

43:21.401 --> 43:24.252
I've been humbled
tonight. I've learnt a lot.

43:25.866 --> 43:27.877
I certainly know what
an export tariff is now,

43:28.409 --> 43:32.237
although I can't help noticing that a
woman is not allowed one mistake.

43:32.262 --> 43:33.776
Oh, don't do that!

43:33.912 --> 43:38.111
I wonder. We've been
asked about strategies,

43:38.722 --> 43:42.009
policies. I've been
accused of sounding vague.

43:43.675 --> 43:47.120
I think I am, perhaps, cautious.

43:48.638 --> 43:49.681
No, I'm scared.

43:49.706 --> 43:53.659
I am. I am terrified, given the
size of the task in front of me.

43:55.327 --> 43:57.495
Has any of you
seen one of these?

43:57.970 --> 44:01.279
They've been on the telly highly
illegal, smuggled in from Taiwan.

44:01.304 --> 44:03.331
I will be surrendering
this to the police

44:03.643 --> 44:04.722
when we are done here tonight.

44:04.746 --> 44:08.589
But for those of you who
don't know, this is called a blink.

44:09.550 --> 44:13.394
A blink is a weapon
created by cyber terrorists.

44:14.280 --> 44:15.308
And it goes...

44:17.124 --> 44:18.124
Blink.

44:20.730 --> 44:23.592
It takes out every
online device...

44:23.617 --> 44:26.255
- She can't do that!
- Within a 30-metre radius.

44:27.681 --> 44:30.281
If you don't mind, I'm talking,

44:30.322 --> 44:31.402
- You can't do that!
- And if you can't manage without

44:31.426 --> 44:32.714
- your phone for five minutes...
- That's ridiculous!

44:32.738 --> 44:34.072
While we talk to each
other face-to-face...

44:34.096 --> 44:35.543
- You can't just do that!
- Like human beings...

44:35.567 --> 44:36.720
You have no right.

44:36.745 --> 44:38.010
What is the point
of anything, sir?

44:38.034 --> 44:39.034
Disgusting!

44:39.850 --> 44:42.681
Because I would go further.

44:43.135 --> 44:44.969
I would legalise the blink.

44:45.477 --> 44:48.710
I would give one of these to every
parent, every teacher, every school.

44:48.735 --> 44:52.346
I would activate the blink in every
classroom, every home, every day,

44:52.761 --> 44:54.532
because do you know what I did?

44:55.880 --> 44:57.899
I looked on my
goddaughter's phone.

44:58.446 --> 45:00.923
She is six years old.

45:01.469 --> 45:03.358
She is six years old.

45:03.383 --> 45:07.476
And do you know what I saw on
the phone of that six-year-old girl?

45:07.501 --> 45:10.819
On the phone of every six-year-old
girl in the country? On the phone

45:10.844 --> 45:14.819
of every six-year-old girl and
boy in the entire civilised world,

45:14.844 --> 45:16.290
I saw this.

45:20.888 --> 45:23.079
- Hey, this is cheating!
- Oh, God!

45:23.104 --> 45:25.796
We are not allowed
to use visual aids.

45:25.821 --> 45:29.040
Get a new plan, Stan! This
is the filth on the phones.

45:29.399 --> 45:31.266
Look at it! Look at it!

45:31.291 --> 45:35.719
Because our children do nonstop
porn streaming into our children's

45:35.744 --> 45:36.767
eyes all day.

45:36.792 --> 45:38.439
You there, laughing,
mate are you proud of this

45:38.463 --> 45:40.461
nonstop porn for kids?

45:40.486 --> 45:41.915
- That's nice.
- Amazing.

45:42.095 --> 45:47.298
Let me guarantee, as your MP, I
will go to Parliament on your behalf

45:47.525 --> 45:52.836
and I will find those CEOs in
California, those high-tech giants,

45:52.861 --> 45:55.930
those men, and I will
bring them back here

45:56.556 --> 45:59.039
not to appear in front
of a Select Committee...

45:59.750 --> 46:02.422
I will bring them
here to stand trial.

46:03.407 --> 46:06.618
I will bring them here
to find them guilty.

46:07.855 --> 46:11.110
I will bring them
here to jail them.

46:11.649 --> 46:14.243
Are you with me?

46:14.302 --> 46:16.301
Yes!

46:20.399 --> 46:22.172
Well, then, ladies
and gentlemen...

46:23.532 --> 46:24.758
tweet that.

46:41.563 --> 46:42.969
I thought you hated her.

46:43.031 --> 46:44.555
Tear the world down.

46:44.580 --> 46:45.836
Ha-ha-ha!

46:46.888 --> 46:48.149
Thanks for coming.

46:55.094 --> 46:56.098
Nice to meet you.

46:57.758 --> 46:59.384
Oh, my God, wait there.
One minute, one minute.

46:59.408 --> 47:00.807
Excuse me! Excuse me!

47:00.832 --> 47:03.789
Hi.Hi. Oh, Viv, hi. For
the kids, do you mind?

47:03.814 --> 47:05.850
Yes. Sure, go ahead,
it's all right. Here we go.

47:11.317 --> 47:12.773
I'm fed up of it now.

47:13.684 --> 47:14.945
Finish off tomorrow.

47:15.905 --> 47:16.905
Going to bed?

47:17.617 --> 47:19.445
Yeah. The money's in.

47:20.340 --> 47:21.804
Thank you, Mr Yamagata.

47:24.804 --> 47:27.898
Ruby's right. I don't
want to move either.

47:30.281 --> 47:33.648
Still, Maddy says there might
be jobs with Simon Harris.

47:34.003 --> 47:36.835
It's worth a try. Coming up?

47:53.109 --> 47:55.152
Signor, lights out downstairs.

47:55.668 --> 47:57.515
Lights out, ground floor.

48:01.731 --> 48:03.296
Goodnight, Stephen.

48:20.483 --> 48:23.194
- It's my phone.
- It's mine as well.

48:27.280 --> 48:29.983
- It's from Sally and Tanya.
- Me too.

48:30.606 --> 48:32.069
And Richard Peel.

48:33.088 --> 48:34.366
What time is it in Tokyo?

48:35.967 --> 48:38.428
Must be about 9am. Just opened.

48:41.454 --> 48:42.701
Do you think it's true?

48:45.845 --> 48:48.505
The Japanese Exchange
Group has issued a statement of

48:48.530 --> 48:50.694
no confidence in
Foster Foster Drake.

48:50.983 --> 48:53.006
Foster Foster Drake
is the second-largest

48:53.031 --> 48:54.694
investment bank in America.

48:55.020 --> 48:58.497
The JXS maintains that Foster
Foster Drake will be filing for a

48:58.522 --> 49:02.155
Chapter 11 bankruptcy as soon
as trading opens on the east coast.

49:05.561 --> 49:07.209
The online bank's gone down.

49:08.490 --> 49:09.686
Must be everyone.

49:10.764 --> 49:13.202
But Foster Foster Drake
doesn't own the Alliance.

49:13.663 --> 49:15.108
No, no. We'll be fine.

49:15.853 --> 49:18.607
It's connected, though.
They ghost a lot of services.

49:22.951 --> 49:26.404
And you left all that
money in one account?

49:27.212 --> 49:30.282
I just... I don't move
money till the morning.

49:30.307 --> 49:33.676
That's what I do. Every
morning, I have a coffee,

49:33.701 --> 49:35.974
and if money needs
moving, that's when I do it.

49:38.392 --> 49:42.391
Nothing we can do until the
banks open. I can sort it then. Okay?

49:59.493 --> 50:02.382
- I'm going to the bank.
- You can't take out 1.2 million.

50:02.407 --> 50:03.567
I know. I'm going to move it.

50:03.626 --> 50:06.103
I always move the money in the
morning. I'm not saying it's your fault.

50:06.127 --> 50:08.228
Celeste, this is the kind of thing
that causes a run on the bank.

50:08.252 --> 50:10.594
Yes, and if there's a run
on the bank, I am running.

50:13.122 --> 50:15.321
- Is that thing working?
- There's no reply.

50:16.919 --> 50:19.961
Keep trying. It's Bruce McNolte.
Patch him through to me.

50:21.157 --> 50:22.750
He's not just a friend,
Bruce. He's a mate.

50:22.774 --> 50:24.211
I wrote that
reference for his son,

50:24.829 --> 50:26.568
and if he could just backdate,

50:26.593 --> 50:28.953
that's all, if he just backdates
the transfer by one day...

50:29.520 --> 50:30.523
Oh, my God!

50:30.679 --> 50:31.882
It's not...

50:32.820 --> 50:34.300
We'll be all right.
Come on. We're...

50:34.875 --> 50:37.085
- We're not just any old customers.
- One at a time.

50:37.110 --> 50:39.647
- I'm sorry. Just one at a time.
- They're going in one at a time.

50:39.671 --> 50:41.054
Sorry, could you just keep back?

50:41.403 --> 50:43.289
Yeah. This is us.

50:45.294 --> 50:46.585
Just hold on. Wait here.

50:55.850 --> 50:57.218
Just keep yourselves back.

50:57.835 --> 51:00.765
Sorry. Hi. This is a
bit of a mess, isn't it?

51:01.138 --> 51:04.242
- I wonder, could you get me in?
- Just have to wait, sir.

51:04.419 --> 51:08.277
No, I'm quite a
special customer.

51:08.716 --> 51:12.489
I haven't just got 500 quid in
an ISA. I'm on the Gold Star list.

51:12.514 --> 51:13.833
Sorry, there's nothing I can do.

51:14.161 --> 51:15.801
You'll have to queue
with the rest of 'em.

51:17.137 --> 51:21.184
Is... Is Bruce McNolte in
there? He's the area manager.

51:21.778 --> 51:23.903
I actually know
Bruce quite well,

51:23.928 --> 51:27.145
I've been to dinner at his
house, and he'd want to see me.

51:27.371 --> 51:29.044
I've told you, there's
nothing I can do.

51:30.833 --> 51:33.289
But I really need to see him.

51:33.879 --> 51:35.869
I need to ask you to
step back, please, sir.

51:36.785 --> 51:37.832
But he's my friend.

51:37.857 --> 51:39.527
Sir, I'm telling you, step away.

51:40.105 --> 51:42.597
Listen, my name
is Stephen Lyons...

51:42.738 --> 51:45.855
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I've been
told to lock the doors. Sorry.

51:46.980 --> 51:48.410
No, they can't...

51:59.183 --> 52:00.808
Let me in! You have my money!

52:00.833 --> 52:01.904
Easy, easy!

52:05.043 --> 52:06.628
No! No!

52:08.974 --> 52:10.121
Let me in!

52:39.230 --> 52:42.727
You can't do this! You've
got £20,000 of my money!

52:54.525 --> 52:55.533
Yeah?

52:55.558 --> 52:58.704
Stephen, can you hear me?

52:58.729 --> 52:59.784
Yes!

53:00.072 --> 53:02.971
It's the same at Clinton Shaw!
The whole thing's going down!

53:03.379 --> 53:06.823
Jesus. Try to get
anything. Anything!

53:09.896 --> 53:11.502
Calm down, ladies and gentlemen!

53:17.502 --> 53:20.307
Let me in, I'm a friend
of Bruce McNolte!

53:21.135 --> 53:22.311
I'm a friend of Bruce!

53:32.332 --> 53:34.328
Move! Move it! Move!

53:36.103 --> 53:39.291
You've got my money, open
the door! You've got my money!

53:45.292 --> 53:46.316
Let me in!

53:48.869 --> 53:50.320
Let me in!

53:56.267 --> 53:57.649
The bank has failed.

53:58.415 --> 53:59.463
Officially.

54:01.579 --> 54:03.294
The Government
could step in, but won't.

54:03.295 --> 54:05.891
So that leaves
us kind of stuffed.

54:07.924 --> 54:09.735
Now, that's the word, stuffed.

54:11.360 --> 54:14.032
I said to Mr Yamagata, can we
wind back a day, just to be nice?

54:14.057 --> 54:16.314
But... no, he said no.

54:17.282 --> 54:19.735
The house is sold and
we've got to get out.

54:20.039 --> 54:21.493
So how much have you lost?

54:22.493 --> 54:26.851
Well, we're covered
up to £85,000.

54:26.876 --> 54:27.876
That's the limit.

54:29.329 --> 54:32.118
There was a temporary
high balance clause, but...

54:32.223 --> 54:33.278
It's gone.

54:33.984 --> 54:35.758
With the collapse of
Foster Foster Drake,

54:35.791 --> 54:37.278
you know, insurance is fucked.

54:37.303 --> 54:40.407
But, Stephen, how
much did you lose?

54:42.404 --> 54:44.141
Minus the 85...

54:46.295 --> 54:47.335
we lost...

54:49.595 --> 54:52.337
£1,135,000.

54:53.821 --> 54:54.821
Oh!

54:55.462 --> 54:56.494
Oh, my God.

54:59.658 --> 55:02.250
But how much of
that can you get back?

55:02.330 --> 55:03.594
Nothing. That's it.

55:04.101 --> 55:06.140
You've still got 85,000, though.

55:06.594 --> 55:08.261
To buy a house?

55:08.262 --> 55:09.953
Is that enough? With
two kids? Really?

55:10.206 --> 55:11.898
Give it to me. I'll have a go.

55:12.055 --> 55:14.686
- Oh, stop it, Rosie.
- No, I won't!

55:14.711 --> 55:18.023
Because they've knackered the
whole country for the second time.

55:18.048 --> 55:21.054
The bankers, the experts, and,
I'm sorry, people like Stephen,

55:21.226 --> 55:23.998
- they did this. Yes, they did.
- All right, Rosie!

55:24.023 --> 55:25.078
Not now.

55:25.176 --> 55:27.695
- No, it's true.
- It is true, it is true.

55:27.780 --> 55:28.843
Are you finished?

55:29.460 --> 55:30.953
Enjoying yourselves? Thanks.

55:31.302 --> 55:34.195
So what about
work? What happens?

55:34.322 --> 55:35.445
It's not great.

55:36.539 --> 55:39.143
I'm the financial adviser
who lost a million quid.

55:39.168 --> 55:42.057
Who might be facing
charges for rioting in the street.

55:42.235 --> 55:44.026
There's no need for that.

55:44.280 --> 55:45.328
Shut up!

55:47.088 --> 55:48.248
So, what are you going to do?

55:49.056 --> 55:50.377
Where are you going to live?

56:03.010 --> 56:05.641
Welcome home. We'll be fine.

56:05.666 --> 56:08.462
There's plenty of room.
Happy little household.

56:23.704 --> 56:27.340
Vivienne Alison
Rook, Four Star Party...

56:30.665 --> 56:34.886
18,556 votes.

56:35.948 --> 56:39.026
Stanley Edward Thomas, Labour...

56:39.051 --> 56:42.315
17,367 votes.

56:42.636 --> 56:44.253
Wow.

56:45.519 --> 56:47.296
Go on, Viv! Yes, you did it!

56:50.562 --> 56:53.904
I declare that Vivienne
Rook is duly elected

56:53.929 --> 56:56.654
as Member of Parliament
for this constituency!

56:56.679 --> 57:00.226
Viv! Viv! Viv!

57:01.444 --> 57:03.424
Oh, my God.

57:06.562 --> 57:07.617
I promise you,

57:08.945 --> 57:12.367
this is the day when
British politics will...

57:13.249 --> 57:14.601
You don't mind, do you?

57:16.366 --> 57:17.475
- No!
- No.

57:20.914 --> 57:21.922
This is...

57:24.498 --> 57:25.889
just the beginning.

57:25.914 --> 57:28.231
This is just the beginning.

57:28.256 --> 57:32.280
Viv! Viv! Viv! Viv!

57:43.967 --> 57:46.047
- He's got to cross the border.
- You mean illegally?

57:46.951 --> 57:50.522
If the exit polls are correct,
this is an extraordinary result.

57:54.678 --> 57:56.920
I will decide!
