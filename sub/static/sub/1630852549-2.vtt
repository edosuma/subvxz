# And I need you today

00:03.040 --> 00:04.560
# Oh, Mandy. #

00:04.560 --> 00:09.400
This programme contains some strong
language and adult humour

00:12.320 --> 00:16.160
Hiya. I'm from Scrubbers,
I'm here to do your downstairs.

00:16.160 --> 00:18.920
Right, I'm just off out for a bit.
I'll leave you to it.OK, yeah.

00:18.920 --> 00:22.520
Is there any specific areas you want
me to clean? All over, really.

00:22.520 --> 00:24.640
Actually, you can start with
the front door.

00:24.640 --> 00:25.800
OK. Thank you.See you.

01:00.240 --> 01:04.040
Alexa, how can I heat up
my steak bake?

01:09.560 --> 01:13.040
Alexa,
play Like A Virgin by Madonna.

01:14.480 --> 01:16.560
SHE TUTS

01:14.480 --> 01:16.560
Waste of money.

01:20.840 --> 01:22.600
Ooh, look, a hot tub.

01:38.520 --> 01:42.000
79 Pritchard Avenue, here we are.

02:13.120 --> 02:16.160
I have always wanted to do
Who Do You Think You Are?

02:16.160 --> 02:18.880
Oh, this is different. This is
Who Are You, Do You Think?

02:18.880 --> 02:21.480
A programme in no way affiliated
to the long-running

02:21.480 --> 02:24.160
and successful genealogy show,
Who Do You Think You Are?

02:24.160 --> 02:27.520
I'd quite like to be Irish.
I always think they seem nice.

02:27.520 --> 02:29.560
Is this the house? Yeah.

02:29.560 --> 02:30.880
Claire Ashbourne.

02:30.880 --> 02:34.120
So all you have to do is, you know,
say a few words about

02:34.120 --> 02:37.080
how moved you are to be tracing
your family tree,

02:37.080 --> 02:41.000
deeply humbled, blah blah blah,
and then knock on the door, OK?

02:41.000 --> 02:43.720
In your own time. And if you feel
like crying at any point,

02:43.720 --> 02:45.760
don't hold back, OK? Action.

02:48.040 --> 02:50.880
I suppose I've always
had an affinity with the north.

02:50.880 --> 02:53.680
They're simple folk,
a bit rough and tumble,

02:53.680 --> 02:55.400
but with an honest kindness.

02:55.400 --> 02:59.920
So to discover I've got relatives
here is really exciting.

02:59.920 --> 03:04.760
A cousin I've never met lives right
here in this house, and she holds

03:04.760 --> 03:07.680
the clue to what I'll be doing next.

03:07.680 --> 03:09.480
So let's go and meet her.

03:13.080 --> 03:15.000
DOORBELL CHIMES

03:15.000 --> 03:16.720
Who the fucking hell's that?

03:23.440 --> 03:24.640
What do you want?

03:24.640 --> 03:26.720
Oh, hello, it's Deborah Meaden.

03:26.720 --> 03:29.960
Who? Deborah Meaden.
I'm with the BBC.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.720
Oh, I only watch ITV.

03:31.720 --> 03:34.280
It's Deborah Meaden. I'm a Dragon.

03:35.240 --> 03:38.000
You having a breakdown?

03:38.000 --> 03:40.400
We rang you up last week. Look.

03:43.400 --> 03:44.720
Happens all the time.

03:44.720 --> 03:45.920
Oils the wheels.

03:45.920 --> 03:47.280
OK, let's go again, Deborah.

03:47.280 --> 03:50.000
And, remember, if you want to cry
at any point, just go for it, OK?

03:53.640 --> 03:57.080
Hello, it's Deborah Meaden.
I believe we're cousins.

03:57.080 --> 03:59.000
All right,
you'd better come through.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.840
Yeah, go through.

04:03.840 --> 04:06.120
This is my house. I live here.

04:10.040 --> 04:11.680
What happened to your arm?

04:11.680 --> 04:14.280
Well, let's say never get involved
in an arm wrestling match

04:14.280 --> 04:16.240
with Hilary Devey.

04:16.240 --> 04:19.400
So I gather we share a great
grandmother.Oh, right.

04:19.400 --> 04:21.840
Yeah. So I've never actually seen
a picture of her.

04:21.840 --> 04:24.440
So I was wondering if you had any
photos tucked away anywhere?

04:24.440 --> 04:26.200
No, no, not on me, no.

04:26.200 --> 04:28.320
Erm, when we spoke over the phone
last week, you said

04:28.320 --> 04:30.440
that you did have some photos,
so it'd be really good

04:30.440 --> 04:32.040
if you could find them.

04:34.760 --> 04:36.800
I'll go and have a look.

04:43.160 --> 04:44.600
Shite on house.

04:46.040 --> 04:48.040
SHE COUGHS

05:18.600 --> 05:21.400
That's her. That's our nan.

05:23.920 --> 05:26.360
I-I don't know what to say.Aw.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.680
Makes you think, doesn't it.

05:28.680 --> 05:31.040
Ooh, does this mean
we'll be filming in India?

05:31.040 --> 05:32.600
Oh, no, I'm afraid not.

05:32.600 --> 05:36.400
We already blew the travel budget
flying Sheena Easton to Sri Lanka.

05:36.400 --> 05:39.320
Sheena Easton? Bloody Sheena Easton.

05:39.320 --> 05:42.040
But, look, erm, the two of you,
what you've got here, I mean,

05:42.040 --> 05:43.960
it's really good. It's lovely stuff.

05:43.960 --> 05:46.920
Erm, have you got anything else
of your nan's?

05:46.920 --> 05:48.360
No.

05:49.520 --> 05:50.840
Are you sure?

05:53.840 --> 05:55.360
I'll go and have a look.

06:00.080 --> 06:01.800
Are we going to be able
to use any of this?

06:01.800 --> 06:03.920
I mean, she's so...

06:03.920 --> 06:06.080
..normal. Oh, Deborah,
she's fantastic.

06:06.080 --> 06:07.840
I mean, the viewers
are going to love her.

06:07.840 --> 06:10.080
I'm just wondering, actually,
if it might be an idea

06:10.080 --> 06:13.040
to take her with us for the rest
of the journey. Really?

06:13.040 --> 06:15.960
Yeah. I mean, the two of you work
really well together.

06:15.960 --> 06:17.320
Be a shame to leave it like this.

06:17.320 --> 06:18.840
I'm not sure.

06:18.840 --> 06:20.360
I mean, you've seen what she's like.

06:20.360 --> 06:22.000
Yeah, no, she's fantastic,
isn't she?

06:22.000 --> 06:23.160
She's TV gold.

06:23.160 --> 06:26.520
OK, let's just crack on
and get this over and done with.

MUSIC: Filastrocca Per Cretini
by Ennio Morricone

06:52.680 --> 06:54.840
Is that what I think it is?

06:54.840 --> 06:56.040
Her earthly remains.

06:58.280 --> 07:03.040
And cut there. Erm, er, basically,
we were wondering

07:03.040 --> 07:06.920
if you'd like to join us
for the rest of Deborah's journey.

07:06.920 --> 07:08.800
Where are you going? Oldham.

07:08.800 --> 07:11.120
We've got some information there
on a relative of yours.

07:11.120 --> 07:14.520
Christ, I hope it's not
a Nazi sympathiser.

07:14.520 --> 07:16.760
No, it's a...it's a local historian.

07:16.760 --> 07:19.080
You'll be meeting with him
in a records office.

07:19.080 --> 07:23.120
Oh, right. Local historian.
I suppose all historians are local

07:23.120 --> 07:24.800
when you think about it.

07:24.800 --> 07:27.680
They say you're never more than
three feet from a local historian.

07:27.680 --> 07:28.880
Or is that rats?

07:28.880 --> 07:30.440
DEBORAH AND MANDY LAUGH

07:31.560 --> 07:33.560
Er, so, erm, are you up for it?

07:33.560 --> 07:35.760
Yeah. Just let me put
some knickers on.

07:38.760 --> 07:40.360
And action.

07:40.360 --> 07:43.320
So, Jeffery, you're a local
historian and you've got some

07:43.320 --> 07:47.480
information on a relative who used
to work in a cotton factory?

07:47.480 --> 07:52.160
Er, Lizzie Haworth, your great great
grandmother, used to work here

07:52.160 --> 07:55.680
as a cotton piercer, repairing
broken lengths of cotton.

07:55.680 --> 07:58.640
A very dangerous job,
and many people had accidents.

07:58.640 --> 08:02.640
And, unfortunately, your great great
grandmother was one of them.

08:02.640 --> 08:05.040
Her fingers got caught up
in the machinery

08:05.040 --> 08:06.920
and she lost six of her fingers.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.440
So she'd have been unable to work.

08:09.440 --> 08:10.680
That's right.Result!

08:12.040 --> 08:17.000
Actually, in those days, of course,
there was no benefit system, so not

08:17.000 --> 08:20.080
working meant life could be very
difficult indeed, especially

08:20.080 --> 08:23.080
if you didn't have any well-off
relatives to help you out.

08:23.080 --> 08:27.040
And I found this in the local paper
from the time.

08:28.160 --> 08:30.920
So February the 8th, 1902.

08:30.920 --> 08:33.600
Miss Lizzie Haworth
has been taken to court

08:33.600 --> 08:35.480
and charged with soliciting.

08:35.480 --> 08:37.000
She was a prostitute!

08:37.000 --> 08:40.240
Wasn't there some other kind
of work she could have done?

08:40.240 --> 08:44.080
Well, she could have taken
in washing, as other women did,

08:44.080 --> 08:47.000
but that was long hours
for very little money. Mm.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.560
And whacking off some chap
would only take a few minutes.

08:51.240 --> 08:54.000
Harder work, though,
with less fingers, so.

08:55.760 --> 08:57.200
And cut.

08:57.200 --> 09:00.160
Thanks, Jeffery, that was wonderful.
Exactly what we're looking for.

09:00.160 --> 09:03.160
Don't you want to see some
of the old factory records?

09:03.160 --> 09:05.800
Er, no, that's great. We've got
everything we need. Thank you.

09:11.520 --> 09:14.480
Do you have any other relatives
who might be able

09:14.480 --> 09:16.400
to bring Deborah's story to life?

09:17.520 --> 09:20.640
Ooh, there's my Uncle Charlie,
but he's a bit...

09:21.720 --> 09:23.440
He's a bit what?

09:23.440 --> 09:25.320
Well, you'll see.

09:33.160 --> 09:35.600
Nature breedin' 'ell.

09:35.600 --> 09:36.760
What do you want?

09:36.760 --> 09:38.080
Th-this is Deborah.

09:38.080 --> 09:39.800
She works at the BBC.

09:39.800 --> 09:42.560
She reckons she's related to us.

09:42.560 --> 09:46.600
Deborah. Deborah, my little
flowerpot petal face.

09:46.600 --> 09:47.840
Me baby!

09:47.840 --> 09:50.120
HE CRIES LOUDLY

09:53.760 --> 09:55.240
Come in, sparrow.

09:55.240 --> 09:56.280
Come in, cock.

09:58.200 --> 10:01.560
Deborah, this is our Uncle Charlie.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.640
He were a stonemason.

10:03.640 --> 10:07.880
I'm not a mason, but I know a good
bit of stonework when I see it.

10:07.880 --> 10:11.760
He went to jail for killing
a man stone dead.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.960
These are your cousins.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.520
They're both grown up now.

10:16.520 --> 10:19.880
Han Solo's a roofer,
and Obi-Wan's a barrister.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.440
A barrister.

10:21.440 --> 10:23.040
What does he specialise in?

10:23.040 --> 10:24.400
Oat-milk lattes, I think.

10:25.720 --> 10:27.760
That's Mick the fitter.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.560
He fits kitchens.

10:29.560 --> 10:32.720
When he were 15 years old,
he had a wood round

10:32.720 --> 10:36.000
and he used to sell chips for
half a crown and logs for two bob

10:36.000 --> 10:38.200
and take 'em round on pram wheels.

10:38.200 --> 10:42.520
He had a try-out with Manchester
City, but they didn't take him on.

10:42.520 --> 10:43.920
And how's he related to us?

10:44.880 --> 10:46.120
He's not.

10:55.240 --> 10:59.240
It's, er, finally time to scatter
your grandmother's ashes.

10:59.240 --> 11:02.840
Er, so just say a few words, have
a little cry if you want to, OK?

11:02.840 --> 11:05.120
Erm, in your own time. Action.

CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS

11:06.560 --> 11:09.280
So it's...it's strange,
because in many ways

11:09.280 --> 11:10.760
I feel like I've come home,

11:10.760 --> 11:14.440
but, then, in other ways,
I can't wait to get back to London.

11:14.440 --> 11:19.240
But it's so moving to be scattering
the ashes of a member of the family

11:19.240 --> 11:23.720
who I'd never met, but in so many
ways feel very connected to.

11:43.320 --> 11:45.520
She would have been so chuffed
to be on the telly.

11:50.640 --> 11:54.360
Well, it's been lovely, but I really
do need to get back to London.

11:54.360 --> 11:57.400
Maybe we can watch the show
together when it goes out.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.160
That'd be lovely.

11:59.160 --> 12:02.400
You will let us know when it's on,
won't you?

12:03.760 --> 12:06.560
Of course, Deborah.Great.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.520
You must pop round sometime.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.600
Yeah, well, thanks.

Ooh.

Mind if I unplug your phone?

12:25.040 --> 12:27.200
I just need to plug
my slow cooker in.

Oh, it's you.

12:42.040 --> 12:43.680
Our show's on today.

12:43.680 --> 12:46.800
You said we could watch it together,
but they never told me it was on.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.880
Yeah, but...Just come through.

12:49.880 --> 12:51.920
Ooh, look, you've got a chandelier.

12:53.040 --> 12:57.720
It's been a really moving
and sometimes baffling experience,

12:57.720 --> 13:01.440
but I think I can safely
say that I now know

13:01.440 --> 13:03.360
who I think I am.

13:05.480 --> 13:08.400
Not as good as Danny Dyer's,
but still all right.

13:08.400 --> 13:09.640
Well, thanks, Claire,

13:09.640 --> 13:12.840
I have to say I genuinely couldn't
have done it without you.

13:12.840 --> 13:14.280
Claire? Who's Claire?

13:14.280 --> 13:15.320
I'm Mandy.

13:15.320 --> 13:17.280
Mandy? You're not Claire Ashbourne?

13:17.280 --> 13:19.440
No. So we're not related?

13:19.440 --> 13:21.360
This whole show's been a lie.

13:21.360 --> 13:22.960
I thought it were weird.

13:22.960 --> 13:25.920
You didn't think to question
why a TV producer was talking about

13:25.920 --> 13:27.760
all the telephone calls
he had with you?

13:28.720 --> 13:30.320
Well, no matter, who's to know.

13:30.320 --> 13:32.960

on Taskmaster, I don't care.

from Meera Syal.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.040
Do you want some stew, Deborah?

13:46.040 --> 13:48.080
Oh, Mandy...

13:48.080 --> 13:49.120
..I'm out.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.640
I'll have some.

# Papa does great with it

14:05.760 --> 14:07.320
# Swings like a gate with it

14:07.320 --> 14:09.200

14:12.360 --> 14:14.080

14:15.240 --> 14:17.680
# He goes fast

14:17.680 --> 14:19.160
# She goes slow. #
