for once, Starman.

11:32.300 --> 11:34.333
What do you say?

11:34.433 --> 11:37.167
No, I'm being literal. I mean,
you just now have my attention.

11:37.267 --> 11:42.700
So I'm gonna need you to just
recap everything you just said.

11:45.867 --> 11:49.133
Okay... you, are you camera
ready?

11:49.233 --> 11:50.533
Um, I think so.

11:50.633 --> 11:52.267
Rad. I need you to stand
in the back...

11:52.367 --> 11:54.100
and pretend to be
a living statue.

11:54.200 --> 11:55.867
Just don't block my face and
definitely don't block my body.

11:55.967 --> 11:58.733
Okay, guys, let's try and make
this one count!

What?

12:21.200 --> 12:23.733
Turn it off!
Huh?

12:28.133 --> 12:30.200
Vernon, you're never gonna
believe this.

12:30.300 --> 12:33.100
Starman is gonna try to convince
you to throw the competition...

12:33.200 --> 12:35.467
so he can bet against you
and win a bunch of extra money.

12:35.567 --> 12:39.833
Vernon, I was thinkin' since you
are the odds-on favorite...

12:39.933 --> 12:43.100
it might be a smart idea for you
to throw the competition.

12:43.200 --> 12:45.367
That way, when we bet
against you...

12:45.467 --> 12:48.200
we'll all make a few
extra bucks.

12:48.300 --> 12:49.733
Sure, count me in.

12:49.833 --> 12:52.733
I thought you said Elvis
was always worth it?

12:52.833 --> 12:55.800
Not when you need cash
as bad as I do.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.900
Ooh, impressive stud work.

her a little visit.

13:04.300 --> 13:07.400
A word with you.

13:12.833 --> 13:18.900
Your boy... he better come
through, or else.

13:19.067 --> 13:22.433
Are you tryin' to intimidate me?

13:23.933 --> 13:28.300
Damn it, Trillions!
He'll throw the match.

13:37.767 --> 13:39.733
Ah, Tunica.

13:39.833 --> 13:42.933
Now if I were Vernon Brown,
where would I be?

13:43.067 --> 13:44.567
Well, that's obvious,
I'd be with me...

13:44.667 --> 13:46.900
but that's beside the point.

13:51.700 --> 13:52.967
Hey, where are you folks headed?

13:53.067 --> 13:55.600

15:12.267 --> 15:13.600
I'd love to get your feedback.

15:13.700 --> 15:15.667
Yeah, awesome. I'll check it out
when I get home.

15:15.767 --> 15:18.733
And be brutally honest...
unless you hate them.

15:18.833 --> 15:20.900
And then, in that case,
please lie.

Bro, uh, what did you
just give her?

15:23.067 --> 15:24.467
Oh, it's just some songs
I've been working on, man.

We can't be giving our
unfinished songs...

15:28.367 --> 15:29.933

15:30.067 --> 15:32.767
Okay, she's not some "chick" and
those demos are my songs.

need th--

is always about you, huh?

Dude, you've had your head so
far up your own ass today...

15:40.933 --> 15:42.333
I'm surprised you didn't
suffocate!

15:42.433 --> 15:44.467
You better shut your mouth!
Or what?

15:44.567 --> 15:46.200
Yo, get screwed, Asher.

15:46.300 --> 15:48.400
No, you get screwed, Dallas.

15:48.500 --> 15:49.633

my lyrics...

15:49.733 --> 15:51.067
without giving me credit...

15:51.167 --> 15:52.767
but you also have to borrow
my insults, as well.

15:52.867 --> 15:56.067
You know what? No! You can--

15:57.100 --> 15:58.267
Get screwed, Dallas!

15:58.367 --> 15:59.300
Maybe we should go.

15:59.400 --> 16:00.767

16:00.867 --> 16:02.933

how this plays out.

to suck.

I was tempted to go
to the Elvis show tonight.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.833
But you know what? I had one
thought in my head...

20:28.933 --> 20:31.300
that kept me from crossing
the state line.

20:31.400 --> 20:33.100
You know what that thought was?

20:33.200 --> 20:35.600
What was it?
Let me in your head, come on.

20:35.700 --> 20:39.233

let a friend down.

I'm a fool...

let me down. I'm sorry, buddy.

this could be our little secret.

a passable Wayne Newton?

say that before.

have it...
