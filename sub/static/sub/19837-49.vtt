WEBVTT

00:02.370 --> 00:04.480
<b>Yeah, this looks real.</b>

00:04.930 --> 00:06.850
<b>There's a video attached.</b>

00:06.850 --> 00:08.110
<b>We have two targets.</b>

00:08.510 --> 00:10.110
<b>A man and a woman.</b>

00:10.530 --> 00:13.660
<b>I'll leave now, so let's meet there.</b>

00:13.660 --> 00:14.610
<b>Got it.</b>

00:15.180 --> 00:16.680
<b>Let's go, Killua.</b>

00:16.680 --> 00:17.240
<b>Yeah.</b>

01:38.990 --> 01:44.040
<b>Pursuit x And x Analysis</b>

01:46.430 --> 01:50.230
<b>After a tip about the Phantom Troupe, 
Gon and his friends move out.</b>

01:50.790 --> 01:53.290
<b>There, they encounter Machi and Nobunaga.</b>

01:53.850 --> 01:58.250
<b>However, the two aren't just 
waiting around to be caught.</b>

02:00.410 --> 02:03.920
<b>Was Uvo really killed?</b>

02:04.770 --> 02:05.810
<b>Probably.</b>

02:07.840 --> 02:10.920
<b>Uvo was more than just a dumb brute.</b>

02:10.920 --> 02:13.070
<b>I know that.</b>

02:13.430 --> 02:17.260
<b>Even if he were fighting 
a difficult opponent,</b>

02:17.260 --> 02:20.200
<b>he had the wits and experience to prevail.</b>

02:22.350 --> 02:23.530
<b>Hello?</b>

02:23.530 --> 02:25.700
<b>I'm the one who submitted the request.</b>

02:25.700 --> 02:28.150
<b>You're late! Where are you?</b>

02:28.150 --> 02:29.720
<b>Stop looking around...</b>

02:29.720 --> 02:31.850
<b>I can see you.</b>

02:31.850 --> 02:34.990
<b>It's the couple behind your boyfriend?</b>

02:34.990 --> 02:36.820
<b>I'll wire the money to you now,</b>

02:36.820 --> 02:38.090
<b>so please confirm receipt.</b>

02:41.210 --> 02:41.840
<b>For real?</b>

02:43.740 --> 02:44.760
<b>Let's go!</b>

02:44.760 --> 02:45.600
<b>Hurry!</b>

02:47.070 --> 02:49.850
<b>But Uvo didn't return.</b>

02:50.430 --> 02:53.480
<b>Has he ever been late without informing us?</b>

02:54.630 --> 02:56.610
<b>But remember what he said?</b>

02:57.140 --> 03:01.110
<b>He wasn't coming back until he 
settled up with that chain user.</b>

03:01.500 --> 03:03.890
<b>That's why I said probably.</b>

03:04.370 --> 03:06.620
<b>I never said he was definitely dead.</b>

03:07.100 --> 03:08.030
<b>Just a hunch?</b>

03:08.950 --> 03:09.850
<b>Just a hunch.</b>

03:12.130 --> 03:14.710
<b>Well, you're usually right.</b>

03:14.710 --> 03:17.500
<b>Okay, we should decide our next move.</b>

03:17.500 --> 03:20.030
<b>How do we catch those two?</b>

03:20.470 --> 03:21.540
<b>It's impossible.</b>

03:23.410 --> 03:25.640
<b>We aren't strong enough to handle them.</b>

03:25.640 --> 03:26.930
<b>What was that?</b>

03:26.930 --> 03:28.670
<b>We won't know until we try!</b>

03:28.670 --> 03:31.330
<b>And why are you saying this now?!</b>

03:31.330 --> 03:33.100
<b>Quiet... They'll notice us.</b>

03:34.100 --> 03:35.610
<b>But it's still true.</b>

03:35.610 --> 03:37.400
<b>I knew it as soon as I saw them.</b>

03:38.890 --> 03:42.490
<b>My dad once had a hit on a Troupe member.</b>

03:43.030 --> 03:43.550
<b>Huh?</b>

03:43.550 --> 03:44.310
<b>What?</b>

03:44.960 --> 03:46.780
<b>One of the few times I've 
ever heard him complain.</b>

03:47.400 --> 03:49.930
<b>Said the job wasn't worth the price.</b>

03:51.220 --> 03:54.540
<b>That's considered the greatest 
compliment a target can get.</b>

03:55.500 --> 03:57.920
<b>That was when he told us</b>

03:58.410 --> 04:00.810
<b>to stay away from the Troupe.</b>

04:02.170 --> 04:03.880
<b>It's been a few years,</b>

04:03.880 --> 04:06.250
<b>so I thought we might stand a chance...</b>

04:07.170 --> 04:10.570
<b>They're really that strong?</b>

04:10.570 --> 04:14.690
<b>Would it help you to picture 
two Hisokas sitting there?</b>

04:16.830 --> 04:18.740
<b>That is definitely not</b>

04:18.740 --> 04:21.190
<b>something we can handle.</b>

04:21.530 --> 04:24.320
<b>So, why do you think they're here?</b>

04:24.320 --> 04:26.970
<b>Aren't they on a date?</b>

04:26.970 --> 04:28.420
<b>Huh? Really?</b>

04:28.420 --> 04:32.200
<b>No, they noticed that other 
couple behind them.</b>

04:32.890 --> 04:36.710
<b>They're paying close attention 
to their surroundings.</b>

04:37.070 --> 04:41.340
<b>At first, I thought it was just caution 
because the Mafia is after them.</b>

04:41.910 --> 04:46.090
<b>But in that case, they wouldn't 
be sitting in a public place.</b>

04:46.880 --> 04:49.850
<b>They aren't worried at all.</b>

04:51.930 --> 04:53.730
<b>They're waiting for someone to find them.</b>

04:54.220 --> 04:57.730
<b>Acting as bait, to draw out their prey.</b>

04:59.180 --> 05:00.730
<b>We're being watched.</b>

05:01.160 --> 05:02.630
<b>They aren't amateurs.</b>

05:03.750 --> 05:06.210
<b>Yeah, I can't tell where they are,</b>

05:06.210 --> 05:08.090
<b>but they're focused on us.</b>

05:08.090 --> 05:09.370
<b>Is it the chain user?</b>

05:09.910 --> 05:11.280
<b>No idea.</b>

05:11.280 --> 05:15.410
<b>If it is, we'll follow the 
boss' orders to go wild.</b>

05:16.480 --> 05:20.330
<b>I believe the boss wishes to recruit him.</b>

05:20.900 --> 05:22.000
<b>Machi...</b>

05:22.940 --> 05:27.260
<b>The boss only told us to find 
him and bring him back.</b>

05:27.980 --> 05:30.890
<b>Have you forgotten the unspoken rule?</b>

05:31.460 --> 05:34.700
<b>Alive or dead. 
By any means necessary.</b>

05:34.700 --> 05:36.270
<b>Right?</b>

05:36.920 --> 05:40.840
<b>You're free to interpret the 
boss' orders as you like,</b>

05:40.840 --> 05:43.370
<b>but you can't force me to agree.</b>

05:43.870 --> 05:46.240
<b>I haven't said anything yet.</b>

05:46.590 --> 05:48.910
<b>You're the one forcing the issue.</b>

05:55.070 --> 05:57.050
<b>The atmosphere changed.</b>

05:57.050 --> 05:58.990
<b>I've got a really bad feeling...</b>

05:58.990 --> 06:00.700
<b>Did they notice us?</b>

06:00.700 --> 06:01.720
<b>It's okay.</b>

06:01.720 --> 06:03.130
<b>They haven't noticed us yet.</b>

06:03.130 --> 06:04.630
<b>Are you sure?</b>

06:04.630 --> 06:09.050
<b>Besides, I can't use <i>Zetsu</i> like 
you guys to mask my presence.</b>

06:09.430 --> 06:12.800
<b>If we used <i>Zetsu</i>, that would 
attract their attention.</b>

06:13.440 --> 06:16.190
<b>They aren't trying to sense <i>Nen</i>.</b>

06:16.750 --> 06:19.220
<b>They're trying to see if there's anyone</b>

06:19.220 --> 06:21.710
<b>in this area who looks or acts suspicious.</b>

06:22.400 --> 06:25.350
<b>So you'd better wipe those 
looks off your faces.</b>

06:25.770 --> 06:27.190
<b>Act normal.</b>

06:28.900 --> 06:31.450
<b>Sorry, that was a bad idea.</b>

06:32.650 --> 06:34.570
<b>Let's make it clear, then.</b>

06:35.030 --> 06:40.100
<b>Are we going to take him dead, or alive?</b>

06:41.690 --> 06:42.730
<b>Fine.</b>

06:48.220 --> 06:49.220
<b>Heads.</b>

06:49.220 --> 06:50.220
<b>Tails.</b>

06:55.490 --> 06:56.640
<b>Her?</b>

06:56.640 --> 06:59.110
<b>Yes, she is Nostrade's daughter.</b>

06:59.110 --> 07:00.230
<b>Her name is Neon.</b>

07:00.780 --> 07:02.830
<b>According to the online Hunter information,</b>

07:02.830 --> 07:06.230
<b>the chain user is one of her bodyguards.</b>

07:06.840 --> 07:09.200
<b>As for her other bodyguards,</b>

07:09.200 --> 07:11.840
<b>we have pictures and names for these five.</b>

07:12.810 --> 07:16.550
<b>And this girl is responsible 
for Nostrade's success?</b>

07:17.240 --> 07:18.640
<b>Most likely.</b>

07:18.640 --> 07:20.530
<b>This information comes 
from the Hunter website,</b>

07:20.530 --> 07:21.770
<b>so it should be accurate.</b>

07:26.110 --> 07:27.000
<b>I see...</b>

07:27.910 --> 07:29.750
<b>Now I understand what happened.</b>

07:29.750 --> 07:32.010
<b>It was wise to switch rooms.</b>

07:32.640 --> 07:36.930
<b>The Phantom Troupe is definitely 
using the pro Hunter website.</b>

07:37.340 --> 07:40.960
<b>If you'd moved any later, 
Neon might have been in danger.</b>

07:40.960 --> 07:41.960
<b>I'm grateful.</b>

07:43.020 --> 07:45.690
<b>Looking ahead, the first step</b>

07:45.690 --> 07:47.760
<b>is to get my daughter home.</b>

07:48.620 --> 07:50.170
<b>Is that okay, Neon?</b>

07:50.900 --> 07:53.280
<b>Well, I don't have a choice.</b>

07:53.770 --> 07:57.320
<b>The auction was canceled, 
so I don't have any reason to stay.</b>

07:59.120 --> 08:01.290
<b>I really wanted to go...</b>

08:01.930 --> 08:04.830
<b>They'll hold another auction next year.</b>

08:04.830 --> 08:06.320
<b>Cheer up.</b>

08:06.320 --> 08:08.270
<b>And I promise I'll recover</b>

08:08.270 --> 08:11.260
<b>the items you wanted from those bandits.</b>

08:11.800 --> 08:12.860
<b>Really?</b>

08:13.220 --> 08:14.860
<b>Yes, I promise.</b>

08:14.860 --> 08:18.310
<b>Have I ever broken a promise?</b>

08:18.310 --> 08:20.920
<b>Have you ever kept a promise?</b>

08:22.240 --> 08:24.840
<b>You make a good point...</b>

08:25.640 --> 08:27.690
<b>I believe your names are 
Melody and Basho?</b>

08:27.980 --> 08:29.050
<b>Yes...</b>

08:29.050 --> 08:32.190
<b>You'll take Neon back to 
the house immediately.</b>

08:32.720 --> 08:36.090
<b>To be on the safe side, 
use simple disguises.</b>

08:37.730 --> 08:38.990
<b>Okay, Neon.</b>

08:38.990 --> 08:41.120
<b>Return to your room and pack.</b>

08:41.390 --> 08:42.550
<b>Okay.</b>

08:45.360 --> 08:47.660
<b>All right, let's get down to our real business.</b>

08:50.120 --> 08:52.880
<b>The auction will resume tonight.</b>

08:53.910 --> 08:55.580
<b>The time and location haven't changed.</b>

08:56.040 --> 08:57.640
<b>The community must demonstrate</b>

08:57.640 --> 09:00.890
<b>that they will not allow anyone 
to intimidate them.</b>

09:01.410 --> 09:05.520
<b>The Ten Dons have vowed to 
recover the stolen merchandise.</b>

09:05.520 --> 09:07.020
<b>The stolen merchandise?</b>

09:07.450 --> 09:09.350
<b>As I told you earlier,</b>

09:09.350 --> 09:11.820
<b>the man we captured claimed</b>

09:11.820 --> 09:15.940
<b>that a Shadow Beast had taken 
everything before they arrived.</b>

09:16.590 --> 09:18.340
<b>Yes, that's correct.</b>

09:20.530 --> 09:23.040
<b>The Shadow Beasts appear to be wiped out.</b>

09:24.000 --> 09:26.270
<b>Nine bodies have been recovered so far.</b>

09:27.170 --> 09:30.480
<b>The final member, Owl, was the one</b>

09:30.480 --> 09:32.170
<b>carrying the merchandise.</b>

09:32.660 --> 09:35.090
<b>He was probably captured by the Troupe.</b>

09:35.830 --> 09:39.290
<b>The Ten Dons understand how 
frightening <i>Nen</i> can be.</b>

09:39.830 --> 09:42.140
<b>If the Troupe has someone who can 
use <i>Nen</i> to compel confession,</b>

09:42.140 --> 09:44.680
<b>they wouldn't even need torture.</b>

09:45.460 --> 09:47.630
<b>It's believed that the merchandise Owl took</b>

09:47.630 --> 09:49.770
<b>has fallen into the Troupe's hands.</b>

09:51.180 --> 09:53.460
<b>So, as I was saying,</b>

09:53.460 --> 09:56.270
<b>with the Shadow Beasts 
destroyed, the Ten Dons</b>

09:56.270 --> 09:58.570
<b>are hiring professionals to handle the Troupe.</b>

09:58.570 --> 09:59.820
<b>Professionals?</b>

10:02.140 --> 10:04.130
<b>To the Mafia,</b>

10:04.130 --> 10:08.250
<b>murder is a tool, not our trade.</b>

10:09.020 --> 10:10.970
<b>Considering our opponents,</b>

10:10.970 --> 10:14.260
<b>it would be better to leave it to the experts.</b>

10:15.280 --> 10:16.220
<b>We'll have them</b>

10:16.220 --> 10:20.630
<b>crush the Troupe for us, 
while avoiding further losses.</b>

10:22.580 --> 10:26.430
<b>However, it's also a chance to make a 
name for ourselves in the community.</b>

10:26.430 --> 10:29.370
<b>We cannot allow those hit men all the glory.</b>

10:30.490 --> 10:31.980
<b>So, Kurapika...</b>

10:32.500 --> 10:35.110
<b>I want you to join those hit men.</b>

10:43.460 --> 10:45.740
<b>Take care of the chain user for me.</b>

10:46.770 --> 10:48.220
<b>Got it.</b>

10:52.610 --> 10:55.190
<b>They're on the move. 
What should we do?</b>

10:55.190 --> 10:58.380
<b>As I told you, we can't 
beat them in a fight.</b>

10:58.380 --> 10:59.890
<b>We'll find a way...</b>

11:00.400 --> 11:02.140
<b>We have to.</b>

11:02.140 --> 11:03.190
<b>Yeah.</b>

11:03.190 --> 11:05.510
<b>We can't leave empty-handed.</b>

11:06.810 --> 11:07.770
<b>Okay.</b>

11:08.060 --> 11:10.550
<b>Then listen carefully.</b>

11:11.110 --> 11:12.910
<b>Gon and I will tail them.</b>

11:12.910 --> 11:16.030
<b>We absolutely cannot let them spot us.</b>

11:16.320 --> 11:17.280
<b>We'll use <i>Zetsu</i>.</b>

11:20.030 --> 11:21.160
<b><i>Wow...</i></b>

11:21.160 --> 11:24.280
<b><i>I can see him standing here, 
but I can't sense him.</i></b>

11:25.180 --> 11:27.410
<b>Gon, I need you to make me two promises.</b>

11:27.930 --> 11:32.670
<b>If they see us, we give up 
immediately and escape.</b>

11:33.210 --> 11:37.050
<b>If I judge that further pursuit is impossible 
for any other reason, we give up.</b>

11:37.050 --> 11:37.970
<b>Got it?</b>

11:37.970 --> 11:39.360
<b>Uh-huh.</b>

11:39.360 --> 11:41.220
<b>The signal to stop will be one phone call.</b>

11:41.730 --> 11:43.600
<b>Make sure your phone's on vibrate.</b>

11:43.600 --> 11:46.460
<b>If they split up, we follow the woman.</b>

11:47.050 --> 11:47.720
<b>Leorio,</b>

11:47.920 --> 11:51.170
<b>contact Zepile, and keep an 
eye on the auction for us.</b>

11:51.170 --> 11:52.530
<b>Got it.</b>

11:52.530 --> 11:54.980
<b>I'm guessing you've never 
tailed anyone before?</b>

11:54.980 --> 11:56.150
<b>Um...</b>

11:56.150 --> 11:57.480
<b>Well...</b>

11:57.480 --> 11:59.770
<b>During the Hunter Exam, I trailed Hisoka.</b>

11:59.770 --> 12:01.530
<b>Really? Without his noticing?</b>

12:01.530 --> 12:04.240
<b>Yeah, I was on his tail for a whole day.</b>

12:06.000 --> 12:08.080
<b>Wow, not bad.</b>

12:08.660 --> 12:10.800
<b>Ow... Why did you hit me?</b>

12:10.800 --> 12:12.360
<b>Uh, it seemed appropriate.</b>

12:13.120 --> 12:15.950
<b>Well, then you should have no problem.</b>

12:15.950 --> 12:18.920
<b>Be sure to stay out of 
their field of vision.</b>

12:19.360 --> 12:20.560
<b>Okay, let's go.</b>

12:20.560 --> 12:21.310
<b>Yeah!</b>

12:27.390 --> 12:31.070
<b>The targets have passed the plaza 
and entered a side street.</b>

12:31.430 --> 12:33.100
<b>Okay, confirmed.</b>

12:33.100 --> 12:34.650
<b>Do they know we're here?</b>

12:35.200 --> 12:36.450
<b>It's okay.</b>

12:36.450 --> 12:39.360
<b>We're using <i>Zetsu</i>, so they shouldn't notice 
us unless something's really wrong.</b>

12:39.660 --> 12:43.420
<b>But they're on constant guard 
against pursuers, so stay vigilant.</b>

12:43.420 --> 12:44.420
<b>Yeah.</b>

12:44.420 --> 12:45.860
<b>You, too.</b>

12:47.120 --> 12:50.100
<b><i>Tsk, he's telling me to be careful?</i></b>

12:50.100 --> 12:54.150
<b><i>I'm the one who has to be alert to 
any change in their movements.</i></b>

12:57.630 --> 12:58.710
<b><i>It's okay.</i></b>

12:58.710 --> 12:59.840
<b><i>They haven't noticed us.</i></b>

13:00.460 --> 13:04.130
<b><i>When they realize we're here, 
they'll react in some way.</i></b>

13:04.900 --> 13:06.340
<b><i>They can try to conceal it,</i></b>

13:06.340 --> 13:09.530
<b><i>but their faces or behavior will betray it.</i></b>

13:11.470 --> 13:16.150
<b><i>I've been put through life-or-death 
shadowing exercises since I was three.</i></b>

13:16.630 --> 13:19.980
<b><i>I won't fail and lose sight of them!</i></b>

13:22.040 --> 13:23.150
<b>Are we being followed?</b>

13:23.810 --> 13:26.990
<b>Most likely, I'd guess.</b>

13:27.800 --> 13:29.480
<b>I'm impressed.</b>

13:30.140 --> 13:31.490
<b>I can't sense a thing.</b>

13:32.380 --> 13:34.250
<b>They must be quite skilled.</b>

13:49.590 --> 13:53.060
<b><i>Crap, they're moving toward a deserted area.</i></b>

13:54.320 --> 13:57.020
<b><i>They must realize by now that 
they're being followed.</i></b>

13:57.830 --> 14:00.530
<b><i>Then is this a trap?</i></b>

14:00.530 --> 14:03.480
<b><i>No, they don't know our exact locations.</i></b>

14:03.920 --> 14:08.210
<b><i>Or maybe they don't know they're being 
followed and are heading back to base.</i></b>

14:08.860 --> 14:11.000
<b><i>That would make this a huge success.</i></b>

14:11.750 --> 14:12.650
<b><i>Is this a trap?</i></b>

14:13.170 --> 14:14.040
<b><i>Or their hideout?</i></b>

14:14.790 --> 14:15.790
<b><i>Which is it?</i></b>

14:16.990 --> 14:18.750
<b><i>If it's a trap, we should run immediately.</i></b>

14:18.750 --> 14:20.440
<b><i>If it's their hideout, we should continue.</i></b>

14:24.870 --> 14:27.050
<b><i>They're acting calm...</i></b>

14:27.800 --> 14:29.050
<b><i>We continue!</i></b>

14:35.420 --> 14:37.230
<b>Our stalker isn't taking the bait.</b>

14:37.730 --> 14:40.560
<b>It probably isn't the chain user.</b>

14:40.560 --> 14:41.640
<b>Why not?</b>

14:42.000 --> 14:44.740
<b>I can sense multiple people tailing us.</b>

14:45.430 --> 14:48.580
<b>But the chain user works alone.</b>

14:48.580 --> 14:49.570
<b>How can you be sure?</b>

14:50.210 --> 14:53.300
<b>He's a member of the 
Nostrade Family, right?</b>

14:53.810 --> 14:58.030
<b>Yet he managed to defeat Uvo on his own.</b>

14:58.680 --> 15:02.330
<b>I'm sure because the Mafia 
hasn't taken any action.</b>

15:02.880 --> 15:05.770
<b>If the Mafia were responsible,</b>

15:05.770 --> 15:09.290
<b>they would use Uvo as a chip 
against us, dead or alive.</b>

15:09.840 --> 15:13.850
<b>Had they killed him, the news would 
probably be on the Net by now.</b>

15:14.600 --> 15:16.110
<b>Since there's nothing,</b>

15:16.110 --> 15:18.530
<b>the chain user probably defeated Uvo alone,</b>

15:18.530 --> 15:21.080
<b>without reporting it to the Mafia.</b>

15:21.620 --> 15:26.860
<b>Why would someone who works 
for the Mafia operate solo?</b>

15:28.360 --> 15:30.470
<b>It was probably a personal grudge.</b>

15:30.470 --> 15:33.250
<b>You're using "probably" a lot.</b>

15:33.250 --> 15:34.340
<b>Shut up.</b>

15:34.820 --> 15:38.310
<b>I doubt that someone seeking 
revenge without Mafia backup</b>

15:38.310 --> 15:40.870
<b>would team up with anyone else.</b>

15:41.380 --> 15:44.090
<b>Thus, the chain user is operating alone</b>

15:44.090 --> 15:46.970
<b>and unrelated to the group now pursuing us.</b>

15:46.970 --> 15:49.830
<b>Your theory has a lot of holes.</b>

15:49.830 --> 15:52.260
<b>Then what do you think?</b>

15:54.070 --> 15:55.340
<b>Indeed...</b>

15:56.000 --> 15:59.740
<b>I suspect that there's a link between 
this tail and the chain user.</b>

16:01.020 --> 16:02.390
<b>You just know?</b>

16:02.620 --> 16:03.620
<b>I just know.</b>

16:04.140 --> 16:05.770
<b>Man...</b>

16:05.770 --> 16:10.150
<b>People who act on instinct 
shouldn't criticize theories.</b>

16:10.150 --> 16:12.000
<b>Well, Killua?</b>

16:12.000 --> 16:14.780
<b>They're waiting for someone 
or trying to lure us out.</b>

16:14.780 --> 16:16.040
<b>One or the other.</b>

16:16.040 --> 16:18.410
<b>Do they know we're following them?</b>

16:18.410 --> 16:20.220
<b>Right now, it's fifty-fifty.</b>

16:20.220 --> 16:22.050
<b>But they don't know our location.</b>

16:22.050 --> 16:25.170
<b>They want to draw us out because 
they don't know where we are.</b>

16:25.740 --> 16:27.670
<b>They're inviting us to show ourselves.</b>

16:27.670 --> 16:28.570
<b>What do we do?</b>

16:29.050 --> 16:30.880
<b>They may be waiting for someone else.</b>

16:30.880 --> 16:32.250
<b>Hold your position and wait.</b>

16:34.650 --> 16:36.180
<b>Gon, I'm hanging up.</b>

16:36.660 --> 16:38.100
<b>Pay close attention.</b>

16:38.100 --> 16:42.180
<b>If they give any kind of reaction, 
we'll run for it!</b>

16:42.700 --> 16:45.170
<b>Escape as soon as I ring the phone.</b>

16:45.170 --> 16:46.030
<b>Got it?</b>

16:46.030 --> 16:47.940
<b>Yeah, got it.</b>

16:48.630 --> 16:49.710
<b>Phinks here.</b>

16:49.710 --> 16:51.450
<b>Oh, what's up?</b>

16:51.450 --> 16:53.240
<b>I wanted to see how you were doing.</b>

16:53.940 --> 16:57.910
<b>We're being followed, 
but they haven't made a move.</b>

16:57.910 --> 17:00.940
<b>And we can't locate them, 
so this will take a while.</b>

17:01.740 --> 17:04.620
<b>Oh, then would you like some helpful info?</b>

17:04.620 --> 17:06.460
<b>Hmm? What do you mean?</b>

17:47.250 --> 17:48.750
<b><i>The stones were a distraction?</i></b>

17:48.750 --> 17:49.500
<b><i>This'll get him!</i></b>

17:51.250 --> 17:52.780
<b><i>He stopped me with ease...</i></b>

17:52.780 --> 17:54.260
<b><i>With one hand!</i></b>

18:05.260 --> 18:06.210
<b>Yo.</b>

18:07.490 --> 18:10.980
<b>Phinks, why are you here?</b>

18:11.720 --> 18:14.490
<b>Weren't you heading out with the boss?</b>

18:14.930 --> 18:16.490
<b><i>This is the fourth floor.</i></b>

18:16.490 --> 18:20.240
<b>To fool the enemy, 
you first fool your allies.</b>

18:21.740 --> 18:23.840
<b>The boss got me good again.</b>

18:24.390 --> 18:28.000
<b>I wondered why there were so 
many <i>Zetsu</i> masters around.</b>

18:28.590 --> 18:29.890
<b><i>Stalking the stalkers?</i></b>

18:29.890 --> 18:32.270
<b><i>Mustache-guy and the woman didn't know?</i></b>

18:32.270 --> 18:33.250
<b><i>They fooled us!</i></b>

18:33.830 --> 18:35.220
<b>Okay, kid.</b>

18:35.730 --> 18:38.030
<b>I have a few questions for you.</b>

18:42.780 --> 18:46.020
<b>Boy, do you know the chain user?</b>

18:46.020 --> 18:46.790
<b>Huh?</b>

18:47.640 --> 18:50.500
<b>A <i>Nen</i> user who uses chains to fight.</b>

18:50.500 --> 18:52.190
<b>We're looking for him.</b>

18:53.120 --> 18:56.690
<b>He asked you to follow us, right?</b>

18:57.300 --> 18:58.440
<b>I don't know who that is.</b>

18:58.830 --> 19:02.160
<b>We were following you 
for our own reasons.</b>

19:02.730 --> 19:04.270
<b><i>I just need one moment...</i></b>

19:04.270 --> 19:06.410
<b><i>With an opening, I can escape!</i></b>

19:07.610 --> 19:08.410
<b>Well?</b>

19:09.450 --> 19:11.270
<b>Well, indeed...</b>

19:11.270 --> 19:13.420
<b>If he's lying, he's really good.</b>

19:14.550 --> 19:15.830
<b>I can check.</b>

19:16.760 --> 19:19.750
<b>Question 1... 
Why were you following us?</b>

19:19.750 --> 19:21.550
<b>Answer concisely.</b>

19:23.790 --> 19:25.650
<b><i>Lying will only make the situation worse.</i></b>

19:26.530 --> 19:30.440
<b>The Mafia has put a huge 
bounty on your heads.</b>

19:30.970 --> 19:35.450
<b>Websites are offering a lot of money 
just for information on your location.</b>

19:36.080 --> 19:39.190
<b>Question 2... 
Who taught you to shadow people?</b>

19:39.630 --> 19:41.360
<b>Well, mainly,</b>

19:41.360 --> 19:45.060
<b>I was using <i>Zetsu</i>, a <i>Nen</i> ability, 
to conceal my presence.</b>

19:45.660 --> 19:48.120
<b>I'm trying to become a pro Hunter.</b>

19:48.120 --> 19:50.000
<b>Who taught you how to do that?</b>

19:51.000 --> 19:52.870
<b>A Shingen-ryu master.</b>

19:53.220 --> 19:54.250
<b>Question 3...</b>

19:54.250 --> 19:57.500
<b>Do you know a <i>Nen</i> user 
who fights with chains?</b>

19:58.010 --> 19:59.340
<b>Chains?</b>

19:59.340 --> 20:02.050
<b>He would be a Conjurer or Manipulator.</b>

20:02.450 --> 20:06.960
<b>Does your master have chains 
hanging from his right arm?</b>

20:06.960 --> 20:10.770
<b>Or perhaps it's you?</b>

20:11.190 --> 20:12.290
<b>I don't know.</b>

20:12.710 --> 20:14.550
<b>My master is an Enhancer,</b>

20:14.960 --> 20:18.280
<b>and he only taught me the 
four major principles.</b>

20:18.870 --> 20:22.380
<b>I see... Well, nothing we 
can do, if you don't know.</b>

20:22.380 --> 20:24.740
<b>Time for the last question, then.</b>

20:24.740 --> 20:26.550
<b>You have two choices.</b>

20:26.550 --> 20:28.540
<b>Consider carefully before you answer.</b>

20:29.850 --> 20:32.210
<b>Do you want to die now or later?</b>

20:32.670 --> 20:34.290
<b>Make your choice.</b>

20:34.290 --> 20:36.540
<b>You have three seconds to answer.</b>

20:44.110 --> 20:46.800
<b>It's useless. 
Don't try anything foolish.</b>

20:46.800 --> 20:48.050
<b>Yes...</b>

20:48.050 --> 20:49.820
<b>Understood, we'll head over.</b>

20:50.730 --> 20:54.170
<b>Boy, your friend surrendered.</b>

20:57.550 --> 20:59.190
<b>I'll ask you once more.</b>

20:59.190 --> 21:00.820
<b>Do you know the chain user?</b>

21:00.820 --> 21:02.810
<b>My answer is the same.</b>

21:02.810 --> 21:03.750
<b>I don't.</b>

21:03.750 --> 21:04.690
<b>I see.</b>

21:05.450 --> 21:07.300
<b>How about you?</b>

21:07.300 --> 21:08.830
<b>Any guesses?</b>

21:31.780 --> 21:33.350
<b>Welcome to our base.</b>

21:39.190 --> 21:42.860
<b>They stand inside the 
Phantom Troupe's hideout...</b>

<b>...nerves mounting to their limits.</b>

<b>Brush Your Teeth.

<b>A Phantom Troupe member.</b>

23:11.170 --> 23:12.270
<b>A Phantom Troupe member.</b>

23:12.270 --> 23:13.620
<b>She's a Transmuter.</b>

23:12.700 --> 23:20.000
<b>Transmutes aura into <i>Nen</i> 
threads that she controls.</b>

23:13.620 --> 23:15.760
<b>She can turn her aura into <i>Nen</i> threads.</b>

23:15.760 --> 23:17.460
<b>Her special technique is Nen Stitches.</b>

23:17.460 --> 23:19.310
<b>She can put your body back together!</b>

23:19.310 --> 23:20.210
<b>Like this!</b>

<b>Next time: Ally x And x Sword.</b>

<b>Bam!</b>

<b>Look! I caught it!</b>

<b>That's one of Milluki's miniature bombs!</b>
