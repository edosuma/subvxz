WEBVTT

00:00.735 --> 00:03.668
E punishment
fit the crime!

00:03.738 --> 00:06.438
It is time for action--
not compaction!

00:06.573 --> 00:10.843
Stand up for those
who have no room to stand up!

00:10.845 --> 00:12.911
Hey, kristian.
Um, you okay?

00:12.980 --> 00:14.379
Should we talk about what's
happening here?

00:14.382 --> 00:17.216
Ah, depends. Are you ready to
face injustice?

00:17.218 --> 00:18.983
Or walk away from it,
like joy?

00:19.020 --> 00:20.786
I mean, she was texting and on
her way to the bathroom,

00:20.855 --> 00:22.320
But still, like,
zero acknowledgment.

00:22.390 --> 00:24.022
Well, you'll be happy to know,

00:24.058 --> 00:25.390
I brought in pamphlets
and donuts

00:25.459 --> 00:27.392
To mark animal cruelty
awareness day.

00:27.461 --> 00:29.628
I will be happy when we no
longer need donuts

00:29.697 --> 00:30.996
To acknowledge a day like this.

00:31.131 --> 00:32.831
Hm. And I love that spirit.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.666
It's just, ah,
scaring some people.

00:34.802 --> 00:36.301
Who?

00:36.303 --> 00:37.869
Have I ever told you
about the time I got stuck

00:37.938 --> 00:39.404
In a shopping cart?
Yes.

00:39.473 --> 00:40.972
They had to call paramedics
to get me out

00:41.042 --> 00:43.007
Because I went into a
panic-induced paralysis.

00:43.044 --> 00:44.309
I said yes.

00:44.445 --> 00:47.512
Really put a damper on my entire
first year of university.

00:47.581 --> 00:50.348
Animals can't speak,
but we can listen.

00:51.852 --> 00:52.985
Thank you.

00:52.987 --> 00:54.953
I'm just saying maybe we can
take a step back

00:54.955 --> 00:56.288
And stick to the pamphlets.

00:56.423 --> 00:58.490
Less human-in-a-cage vibes,
ya know?

00:58.559 --> 00:59.791
I see.

00:59.827 --> 01:01.059
S'all good,
but could you just...?

01:01.062 --> 01:03.295
Kristian:
Sure.

01:03.297 --> 01:06.632
Huh. See? Adults getting stuck
in stuff is a real "thang".

01:06.767 --> 01:08.100
No, I'll get paul.

01:08.235 --> 01:09.968
Oh, and, can I get
a honey cruller?

01:09.970 --> 01:12.370
♪ I don't lose my cool ♪

01:12.406 --> 01:15.841
♪ I love to call you mine ♪

01:15.976 --> 01:19.144

01:27.421 --> 01:29.721
Oh, nikki, remember,
middens likes his bowl half full

01:29.790 --> 01:32.324
And snowball only eats once all
of middens' food is gone.

01:32.393 --> 01:34.760
Okay. Is this if you die, or...

01:34.895 --> 01:35.961
No, my conference is this
weekend.

01:36.030 --> 01:37.129
You're feeding my cats.

01:37.131 --> 01:38.129
Why would I do that?

01:38.165 --> 01:39.797
That's like, the job I do
all day.

01:39.834 --> 01:40.832
Because that's what we agreed on

01:40.901 --> 01:42.367
When I gave you the weekend off.

01:42.369 --> 01:45.470
Right! But then marko scored
tickets to beach screech, so...

01:45.473 --> 01:46.772
I don't care about
beach screech.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.941
Nobody cares. That's what makes
it so frickin' awesome.

01:49.076 --> 01:50.075
Nikki!

01:50.077 --> 01:51.409
Just get russ
and peg to do it!

01:51.445 --> 01:53.078
They live for errands,
it's like their crack.

01:53.147 --> 01:54.946
I didn't ask uncle russ
and aunt peggy. I asked you.

01:54.982 --> 01:56.482
And I asked them
and they just said yes.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.550
You're lucky you have parents
that can bail you out

01:58.619 --> 02:00.018
At a moment's notice.

02:00.020 --> 02:02.287
Sounds more like they're bailing
you out.

02:02.422 --> 02:03.889
Here, you can give them my keys.

02:03.891 --> 02:05.624
Oh my god.
I've got to do everything.

02:05.693 --> 02:06.692
Seriously?

02:06.827 --> 02:08.227
Oh, it's fine.
They're coming to pick them up.

02:08.362 --> 02:09.827
Oh. Maybe I can get a ride to
the go station?

02:09.864 --> 02:11.696
Who's the freeloader now?

02:13.634 --> 02:17.569
♪ love it when
they day's right ♪

02:17.704 --> 02:20.072
♪ love it when
the day's bright ♪

02:21.141 --> 02:22.508
Hi! Did you miss me?

02:22.643 --> 02:23.441
(phone line ringing)

02:23.477 --> 02:25.109
Hope you shared
the rattle mouse.

02:25.146 --> 02:26.578
I'm looking at you, snowball.

02:26.614 --> 02:27.846
Aunt peggy:
<i> Hi, you've reached peggy.</i>

02:27.981 --> 02:30.782
<i> This is my cellular telephone.</i>
<i> Please leave a message.</i>

02:30.784 --> 02:33.851
<i> Hm, how do I end it?</i>
<i> Russ, how do I end it?</i>

02:33.888 --> 02:35.020
Uncle russ:
<i> I'm in the bathroom.</i>

02:35.022 --> 02:36.521
Aunt peggy:
<i> Russ!</i>

02:36.524 --> 02:38.357
(beep)

02:38.492 --> 02:40.259
Hey, aunt peggy!
Just a head's up.

02:40.394 --> 02:42.260
I got home early
from the conference.

02:42.396 --> 02:45.463
Thanks for feeding the cats and
obvi you can skip today.

02:45.499 --> 02:46.831
Okay. Bye.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.082
Why is this here?

03:04.084 --> 03:05.950
'cause that's where it belongs.
It's a mess,

03:05.986 --> 03:07.285
And nowhere near what I wanted.

03:07.321 --> 03:09.488
You did this? Yourself?

03:09.623 --> 03:11.690
Like, with paint and
paintbrushes?

03:11.759 --> 03:13.024
This time, yeah.

03:13.060 --> 03:15.360
Wow. I can't even draw
stick figures.

03:15.495 --> 03:17.229
It's just something I started
in prison.

03:17.364 --> 03:19.030
It-- it became my escape,
you know?

03:19.066 --> 03:21.199
The.. The thing
that made me feel free.

03:21.334 --> 03:23.001
Except for the time I actually
did escape,

03:23.037 --> 03:24.403
But that didn't last long.

03:24.405 --> 03:26.171
That's how I feel
when I go windsurfing.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.307
I've only been twice,
and I fell a lot,

03:28.442 --> 03:30.175
But one time I got going for,
like, a minute

03:30.310 --> 03:32.444
And it was crazy.

03:32.513 --> 03:33.845
Thing is I'm not getting
any better.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.881
I-I might even be gettin' worse.

03:35.883 --> 03:38.250
My work lacks soul and purpose.

03:38.385 --> 03:39.718
And I ran out of green.

03:39.787 --> 03:41.519
I don't think that's true.

03:41.555 --> 03:43.321
Well, I know you can make green
from other colours.

03:43.357 --> 03:45.123
I just don't remember
which ones they are.

03:45.125 --> 03:47.392
Anyway, my point is,
I am done with painting.

03:47.527 --> 03:50.796
No! I never followed my dream
and I always regretted it.

03:50.931 --> 03:52.063
You're 25.

03:52.099 --> 03:54.165
I'm just saying true passions
are about how you feel

03:54.235 --> 03:55.467
When you're doing them,

03:55.602 --> 03:57.803
Not how many times you get hit
in the head by a sail.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.637
I guess that's true.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.941
Sorry about the teabag stain.
That was me.

04:03.978 --> 04:05.343
It's all good.

04:08.215 --> 04:09.347
Peggy:
You can't just let

04:09.416 --> 04:11.482
Random strangers
into shannon's building.

04:11.518 --> 04:13.018
(sighing)
it was the mailman!

04:13.020 --> 04:14.820
He was dressed as a mailman.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.157
(thudding)

04:19.226 --> 04:21.326
Peg.
It was open.

04:21.462 --> 04:25.496
Okay, snowbird, where do you
want your toilet pebbles?

04:25.532 --> 04:27.766
Oh, remind me to put the laundry
in when we get home.

04:27.835 --> 04:30.502
Apparently all of nikki's
bustiers are dirty.

04:30.571 --> 04:32.237
Russ:
I still don't even know
what a bustier is.

04:32.306 --> 04:34.639
Peggy:
I keep hoping that
shannon's sense of style

04:34.675 --> 04:35.774
Rubs off on niknak.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.109
It's obvious that nikki
looks up to her.

04:38.178 --> 04:39.444
Russ:
Ah, it's not that obvious.

04:39.480 --> 04:42.447
Oh, nikki just won't admit it.
Oh, god!

04:42.449 --> 04:46.318
Would you look at shannon's
pantry? It's so organized.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.453
Yeah. She went a little nutso
with the label maker.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.756
Shanny's clearly got
some time on her hands.

04:50.758 --> 04:53.925
At least she's tidy. Nikki could
learn a thing or two.

04:53.927 --> 04:56.595
Ah, it's not fair to compare
nikki to a type a neat freak.

04:56.597 --> 04:58.663
Peggy:
My sister was smart.

04:58.699 --> 05:00.665
When you adopt you get to
comparison shop, you know?

05:00.734 --> 05:01.733
Pick a good one.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.268
I'm not sure that's how it
works, honey.

05:03.270 --> 05:05.904
Nikki better start pulling her
weight, or that's it.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.239
She can wash her own bustiers!

05:07.374 --> 05:09.941
Jesus, russ.
No! No more living with us.

05:09.943 --> 05:12.744
And if nikki doesn't like it,
she can get her own place.

05:12.879 --> 05:14.212
We're not the four seasons.

05:14.348 --> 05:15.747
Russ:
She does use all
my shaving cream.

05:15.882 --> 05:17.015
What are you shaving?

05:17.017 --> 05:19.283
It's personal.

05:19.320 --> 05:22.087
♪ I wanna open up
what's real to me ♪

05:22.156 --> 05:24.089
♪ when I'm with you ♪

05:24.091 --> 05:25.223
Paul:
Hey.

05:25.292 --> 05:26.625
(knocking)
got a sec?

05:26.627 --> 05:29.428
Sure. I was just googling
how to swim. What's up?

05:29.430 --> 05:32.397
Thanks again for your
encouragement the other day.

05:32.399 --> 05:34.432
Hey, us dreamers
gotta stick together.

05:34.468 --> 05:37.102
Yeah. I actually had a bit
of an abt.

05:37.104 --> 05:40.037
Artistic breakthrough.
It came together really quickly.

05:40.074 --> 05:44.242
Just sat at my easel and became
a vessel of joy-spiration.

05:44.378 --> 05:45.577
Is this for me?

05:45.646 --> 05:46.711
Yep.

05:46.714 --> 05:48.213
I don't even get presents
on my birthday.

05:48.282 --> 05:50.114
My dad usually just pats me on
the head and says,

05:50.150 --> 05:51.383
"never trust the bank."

05:51.518 --> 05:56.154
It's good advice,
but it's not a gift.

05:56.289 --> 05:57.589
Wow.

05:57.591 --> 06:00.359
It's you! I mean--
I mean, not literally,

06:00.494 --> 06:02.460
But, you know, your energy,
your essence.

06:02.529 --> 06:06.932
Yeah. No, no, no. This is, uh...
This is really...

06:07.067 --> 06:08.266
I love it.

06:08.402 --> 06:11.069
I was hoping you'd say that!
I'll go get my drill.

06:11.138 --> 06:12.670
Mm. Mm-hm.

06:16.743 --> 06:17.675
(barking)

06:17.745 --> 06:20.612
I already have a boyfriend
named marko.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.880
You don't sound like him,
he's way hotter.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.149
(giggling)

06:24.218 --> 06:26.150
No, I know it's you, babe.
Just go with it.

06:26.186 --> 06:28.820
Hey, uh, have you seen kristian?

06:28.889 --> 06:30.955
Okay, but tonight wear
your baggies.

06:30.991 --> 06:32.624
Your skinny jeans take too long
to get off.

06:32.693 --> 06:34.692
And bring your laundry.
It's washy Wednesday for peg.

06:34.762 --> 06:38.096
She'll be all over it.
'kay, bye.

06:38.165 --> 06:39.697
Hey. Sounds fun.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.266
Thought you were looking
for kristian?

06:41.268 --> 06:44.168
I always got time for my cuz.
Big plans?

06:44.204 --> 06:45.203
Hangin' with marko.

06:45.239 --> 06:47.572
Huh. Peggy and russ don't mind?

06:47.707 --> 06:48.840
I stuff a pillow in
the air vent.

06:48.876 --> 06:50.441
It muffles most of
the high-pitched stuff.

06:50.477 --> 06:52.244
Mm-hm. Well,
it's just their house.

06:52.379 --> 06:53.711
Shouldn't you check
with them first?

06:53.747 --> 06:56.047
Peg loves marko. She told
him he's a wannabe entrepreneur.

06:56.183 --> 06:57.715
That meant a lot to him.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.785
Yeah, it's up to you but someone
I looked up to secretly

07:00.854 --> 07:03.989
Once told me that super-cool
people respect their parents.

07:04.124 --> 07:05.690
None of that sounds right to me.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.393
Yeah, I just think as a woman
in your 30s living at home,

07:08.462 --> 07:10.261
You might want to be a little
bit more considerate

07:10.263 --> 07:11.229
Of russ and peggy.

07:11.364 --> 07:12.297
Why? Did they say something?

07:12.432 --> 07:14.733
No! Not exactly.

07:14.735 --> 07:16.535
I-- I just mean if you're going
to live with your parents,

07:16.670 --> 07:19.537
Which at your age is maybe a
little... Surprising.

07:19.573 --> 07:20.371
Ageism.

07:20.441 --> 07:21.739
Maybe just don't push it
right now?

07:21.775 --> 07:23.742
Take a break on the sleepovers.
Sweep the floor.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.911
Last week I changed the toilet
paper, like, three times.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.812
What more do they want?
I'm not a washing machine.

07:27.881 --> 07:29.280
Just be respectful.

07:29.349 --> 07:32.417
Before I moved out,
I had to respect 'dem rules.

07:32.486 --> 07:33.818
When they said
"no tap shoes inside,"

07:33.887 --> 07:36.087
I stopped wearing my tap shoes
inside.

07:36.089 --> 07:37.022
I thought you did jazz.

07:37.157 --> 07:38.457
I did. But I had tap shoes.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.591
That I liked and I wore inside.

07:51.638 --> 07:54.105
Hey, joy, still waiting on
those dog bios.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.306
Uh, yeah.

07:55.342 --> 07:57.008
Is everything--
oh my god!

07:57.144 --> 07:58.243
It's a gift from paul.

07:58.312 --> 08:00.578
Oh. Are those fangs?

08:00.647 --> 08:02.814
Makes it kind of hard to work.

08:02.883 --> 08:05.049
Well, you don't have to keep
that up.

08:05.085 --> 08:06.718
It means a lot to paul.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.686
It's a nice gesture,
but it's clearly inappropriate

08:08.722 --> 08:10.388
For the workplace.
We can just talk to him.

08:10.457 --> 08:12.290
Oh, I don't know.
Paul?

08:12.292 --> 08:13.791
I-- I don't think you should
say anything.

08:13.861 --> 08:14.926
Oh, don't worry.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.127
It's best to just nip problems
in the bud,

08:16.129 --> 08:17.929
And paul's like an elephant,
thick skin, no memory.

08:17.965 --> 08:19.997
Elephants have really good
memories.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.165
Someone's a little elephant.

08:21.235 --> 08:22.366
Hey. Is this urgent?

08:22.402 --> 08:24.002
I got a hamster
who just flipped over his cage.

08:24.137 --> 08:25.469
Uh, no.
This won't take long.

08:25.506 --> 08:27.071
Joy just wants to talk to you
about something.

08:27.107 --> 08:28.472
Paul:
Yeah. What's up?

08:28.509 --> 08:30.942
Uhh... It's just...

08:30.978 --> 08:34.012
Shannon wants me to take
the painting down.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.313
Sorry?
Yeah.

08:35.315 --> 08:39.284
I think it's beautiful, but
shannon says it's inappropriate.

08:39.353 --> 08:41.886
I did say that,
but that was because--

08:41.922 --> 08:43.288
Is it that bad?

08:43.290 --> 08:44.756
Shannon recoiled when
she saw it.

08:44.758 --> 08:48.092
Well, that was before learning
how much joy loves this piece.

08:48.128 --> 08:49.394
What?

08:49.463 --> 08:50.662
Beauty is in the eye of the
beholder,

08:50.797 --> 08:52.130
And this is joy's
office, so...

08:52.265 --> 08:54.466
But it's your shelter, so--
but it's our world,

08:54.468 --> 08:56.434
And if paul's painting brings
you happiness,

08:56.470 --> 08:59.236
Who am I to stand in the way?
Great work, paul.

08:59.273 --> 09:00.639
Thanks, shannon.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.573
So great, that's exactly what
I was going for--

09:02.609 --> 09:03.775
A little bit of joy.

09:03.910 --> 09:07.312
In fact, it's called
"bits and pieces of joy."

09:07.314 --> 09:08.679
Joy:

09:26.733 --> 09:31.002

09:34.007 --> 09:36.074
Hardly. I took your advice.
Time to move out.

time in their gulag.

Hell, we gonna thrive!

Can it wait?

10:32.833 --> 10:34.865
Why is your painting in here?

10:37.371 --> 10:41.339
Oh! Wow. That's weird.

10:41.341 --> 10:42.607
Maybe it's one of those
paintings

10:42.742 --> 10:44.342
That follows you around
the room.

10:44.344 --> 10:46.277
Or from room to room.

10:46.279 --> 10:48.512
I'm already sharing my apartment
with the roommate from hell.

10:48.548 --> 10:50.749
I can't share my office with...
That.

10:50.751 --> 10:51.950
I'll take your roommate.
I don't mind.

10:52.085 --> 10:53.484
I already live with
seven people.

10:53.553 --> 10:55.753
No. It's nikki and I would never
do that to you.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.388
Fine. I'll take her.

10:57.391 --> 11:01.493
But we can never change the fact
that she's been here.

11:03.563 --> 11:05.430
It does feel colder in here.

11:05.499 --> 11:07.832
(puppies whimpering)

11:07.834 --> 11:10.301
Hi. Thanks so much
for coming in.

11:10.303 --> 11:11.669
It sounded important
on the phone.

11:11.705 --> 11:12.671
I didn't mean to sound dramatic.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.372
I just care so much
about you guys.

11:14.374 --> 11:15.740
Aw, we care about you, too,
kiddo.

11:15.876 --> 11:16.975
You might even say I look
up to you,

11:16.977 --> 11:18.843
The way someone else might
look up to me.

11:18.978 --> 11:20.011
Okay.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.579
And I just hate the thought of
you all alone

11:21.648 --> 11:23.648
In that big, empty house with no
one to care for.

11:23.717 --> 11:25.517
Aww.
Yeah, we got each other.

11:25.652 --> 11:26.851
But you've got such big hearts.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.921
And speaking on behalf of
someone who may be unable

11:29.923 --> 11:33.725
To say it themselves,
I bet they miss having a home.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.260
Aww.

11:35.395 --> 11:36.828
Help make your family whole
again.

11:36.963 --> 11:39.631
Well, we have talked about it.

11:39.766 --> 11:41.266
Oh, nikki!
What?

11:41.401 --> 11:43.735
Shannon:
Your parents have something
to tell you.

11:43.737 --> 11:46.204
We're getting a dog.
Sorry?

11:46.273 --> 11:47.906
Well, yeah!
Shannon really sold us on it.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.474
And now that we have
the space...

11:49.609 --> 11:50.708
No, I meant nikki.

11:50.744 --> 11:52.209
You called me a dog?

11:52.211 --> 11:54.378
No, I was trying to convince
your parents to take you back.

11:54.414 --> 11:57.115
That's why you called us?

11:57.250 --> 11:58.416
But you're allergic.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.218
I'll take pills.
Lord knows I did for you.

12:00.287 --> 12:02.687
And come by to get the rest
of your stuff, honey.

12:02.756 --> 12:05.156
Keep it. Shannon and I have
everything we need.

12:05.225 --> 12:08.526
And no stupid rules,
or games night, or hydro bills!

12:08.528 --> 12:10.961
Hashtag roomies!
We do pay hydro.

12:10.997 --> 12:12.597
Sounds like everyone's happy!

12:12.599 --> 12:13.765
Okay, maybe we should all
slow down

12:13.767 --> 12:14.866
Before we say something
we regret.

12:15.001 --> 12:16.034
Nikki:
Good luck with your dog.

12:16.169 --> 12:17.701
Until you talk behind its back,
and it leaves

12:17.738 --> 12:18.903

with cats,

12:19.038 --> 12:20.771
'cause you're impossible
to live with!

12:20.807 --> 12:22.373
Shannon:
Okay, well that qualifies.

12:22.375 --> 12:26.244
Now, if you'll excuse us,
we have an rv to test drive.

Yeah. Road tripping

(chuckling)
that's what drake calls ontario.

12:31.050 --> 12:33.484
Peggy:
See ya soon, roomies! Come on.

12:33.553 --> 12:37.121
Well, think about it.
There's lots of options.

12:37.124 --> 12:39.190
Let's get hammered
and order pizza tonight.

12:39.226 --> 12:40.792
I'll get ya next time.

12:44.331 --> 12:45.830

12:45.832 --> 12:47.598
Oh, am I stuffing these wrong,
or...?

12:47.667 --> 12:50.534
No. I mean, yeah, you are,

12:50.570 --> 12:54.272
But it's not you. It's this.

12:54.341 --> 12:55.807
Oh! Uh, yeah, I've--

12:55.809 --> 12:57.542
I've actually always liked
that painting.

12:57.611 --> 12:59.010
It's new.

12:59.012 --> 13:00.345
Huh.

13:00.347 --> 13:03.981
Paul painted it for me. Of me.
What do you think of the teeth?

13:03.983 --> 13:06.684
Uh, well,
it's better than no teeth.

13:06.720 --> 13:08.252
He gave me fangs.

13:08.321 --> 13:10.288
Yeah, yeah.
It's-- nice touch.

13:10.357 --> 13:12.756
Maybe I just don't get art.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.526
Well, um, I--
I can explain it to you.

13:14.661 --> 13:18.495
So, uh, this painting
represents you, joy,

13:18.532 --> 13:21.365
But with, um...

13:21.401 --> 13:23.534
Wings.
Uh...

13:23.603 --> 13:25.769
I actually need more envelopes,
so I'm gonna--

I hope I don't get the bathroom!

14:03.843 --> 14:07.011
You can spin it first.
And second.

14:07.013 --> 14:11.082
Okay. Ah, well, then maybe we
could get out our goal journals

14:11.217 --> 14:12.884
And compare five-year
career plans.

14:13.019 --> 14:15.553
No need. My goal is to get baked
and put my feet up.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.789
Gotta slow down to speed up,
you know?

14:17.791 --> 14:19.290
Sure, sure.

14:19.326 --> 14:23.928
But eventually you'll need to
start working towards something.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.696
You know, when I first moved out
on my own--

14:25.832 --> 14:27.098
You found yourself
and a career path you love

14:27.233 --> 14:29.300
And ended up in hamilton.
I've heard the story.

14:29.302 --> 14:30.734
Peg loves to tell it.

14:31.771 --> 14:33.004
Hey, twinsies!

14:33.073 --> 14:34.505
Why, where's your slushie?

14:34.574 --> 14:35.673
Ah, no.
I have the same bathrobe.

Love bubble.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.318
It's a reality show set in domes

14:47.387 --> 14:50.654
Where contestants have to
isolate to prove their love.

14:50.690 --> 14:52.390
Oh, crap.

Woof. Really? Sorry.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.600
Do you mind putting it
in the wash?

15:02.669 --> 15:04.802
Sure, but this stain's
gonna be a bitch.

What the hell happened?

15:41.074 --> 15:43.207
Joy: Max did it.
Yeah, I tried stopping him,

15:43.209 --> 15:45.777
But he kept pushing me out
of the room saying I was next.

15:45.912 --> 15:47.845
The face is the best part!

15:47.881 --> 15:52.049
Okay. Or-- or maybe he was just
trying to fix it.

15:52.185 --> 15:53.451
Maybe he liked parts of it,

15:53.586 --> 15:55.386
But thought there was something
wrong with the teeth,

15:55.422 --> 15:58.322
Like, they were fangs, so he
used hand sanitizer

15:58.391 --> 16:00.924
To smooth the points out with
his thumb.

16:00.961 --> 16:02.727
And then the whole thing got
smudged

16:02.862 --> 16:04.995
And I think he tried to paint
back the eyebrows

16:04.997 --> 16:06.363
And then the mouth.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.700
I mean, I think he actually did
a pretty good job on the mouth.

16:08.835 --> 16:10.735
I just wish max would've told me
he didn't like it.

16:10.737 --> 16:13.805

to be the reason

I'm sorry.

17:30.083 --> 17:32.483
I should be happy.
I painted the house,

17:32.485 --> 17:34.018
Baked sourdough and--

17:34.153 --> 17:35.820
And now we're getting into
couples' yoga.

17:35.955 --> 17:37.822
Yeah, that's not for everyone.

17:37.824 --> 17:39.490
But what about your trip?
That rv sounds--

17:39.625 --> 17:41.024
It's a coffin on wheels!

17:41.061 --> 17:42.993
Russ and I have already run out
of things to talk about.

17:43.063 --> 17:46.197
It turns out the only sound
worse than marko and nikki

17:46.332 --> 17:47.498
Pounding it out
in the trundle bed

17:47.633 --> 17:50.201
Is the utter silence at the
dinner table.

17:50.270 --> 17:53.170
Well, maybe it's not too late
to get the band back together

17:53.206 --> 17:55.073
And have nikki move home.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.907
Oh. Hello, mother.
Don't mind me.

17:56.976 --> 17:59.376
I was just, um, dropping off
some more of your stuff.

17:59.446 --> 18:01.846
Unless you'd prefer I drive your
childhood toys to the dump?

18:01.915 --> 18:05.582
I don't care. Livin' my best
life with shans now.

18:05.618 --> 18:08.786
Well, settle in because russ
wants to sell the house.

18:08.788 --> 18:09.987
What?

18:10.023 --> 18:11.322
Mm. He's got his heart set on
living in the rv

18:11.457 --> 18:13.190
And exploring the nation's
parking lots.

18:13.326 --> 18:15.159
Good. Maybe I'll buy the house.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.594
Maybe I'll burn it down.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.028
Okay. You both need to stop.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.997
Nikki, is there anything you
want to say to peggy?

18:19.999 --> 18:21.465
Your haircut's crooked.

18:21.501 --> 18:22.666
It's not. It's modern.

18:22.702 --> 18:23.701
Okay, I'll say it then.

18:23.836 --> 18:24.969
What do you mean?

18:25.038 --> 18:26.370
Shh. I'm peggy now.
Nikki, I love and miss you.

18:26.506 --> 18:27.839
Would you like to move back
home again?

18:27.974 --> 18:29.072
I never said that.
Shh.

18:29.109 --> 18:30.141
(monotone)
hey, mom, I hear you.

18:30.210 --> 18:31.609
I don't sound
like that.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.578
And even though I'm proud
and crap, there's a part of me,

18:34.614 --> 18:36.447
Sort of, that wants to move back
home again.

18:36.582 --> 18:37.949
Well, I knew you missed me!

18:38.084 --> 18:39.450
She said, "sort of."

18:39.452 --> 18:41.819
Peggy? I just want things to go
back to how they were.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.487
Well, nikki is welcome,

18:43.556 --> 18:46.023
But no more overnight trysts
with marko.

18:46.059 --> 18:48.292
Thanks, mom. I'd be happy
to move back home

18:48.328 --> 18:50.294
And "respect your boundaries."

18:50.363 --> 18:51.762
Okay, don't give away
the farm here.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.096
Well you don't pay rent,
so guess what?

18:53.133 --> 18:54.098
I'm kicking you out.

18:54.167 --> 18:55.833
Wait, were you peggy?

18:55.968 --> 18:56.934
Yeah, I was confused too.

18:57.069 --> 18:59.870
No, I was me.
Now hug.

18:59.939 --> 19:01.772
I think we're good.

19:01.841 --> 19:04.308
Hey.
Uh, listen, so I--

19:04.443 --> 19:08.446
I know there was that whole
thing with max and I just, uh,

19:08.448 --> 19:09.880
I wanted to give you--

19:09.949 --> 19:12.049
Well, I made you a whole
new piece.

19:12.085 --> 19:15.852
Paul, I really don't need--

19:15.889 --> 19:17.254
Wow!

19:17.290 --> 19:19.190
Yeah, yeah. I took a look at
some of my old realism work,

19:19.325 --> 19:21.859
And it sort of reignited the
flame and I thought,

19:21.994 --> 19:24.128
"why not try to do a more
life-like portrait,

19:24.130 --> 19:27.465
"even though it's boring."

19:27.600 --> 19:29.666
Oh. Am I pregnant?

19:29.702 --> 19:32.603
I don't know. But, uh, you are
in the painting.

19:32.672 --> 19:33.905
Okay.

19:34.040 --> 19:36.774
See, I put your face on an old
piece I did of my pal, April.

19:36.909 --> 19:39.410
She had twins right before
she had to flee the country.

19:39.412 --> 19:41.746
That answer leaves me with so
many questions.

19:41.748 --> 19:44.015
Oh, there's nowhere to hang a
painting when you're on the run,

19:44.017 --> 19:45.549
So... Voilà.

19:45.585 --> 19:48.919
Well, this is really nice, paul.
Thank you.

19:48.955 --> 19:50.187
Yeah, you're welcome.

19:50.190 --> 19:51.989
Aw! A new painting!
It's beautiful.

19:51.991 --> 19:55.593
See, it pays to tell the truth
when you don't like something.

19:55.728 --> 19:57.060
What didn't you like about it?

19:57.096 --> 19:59.797
Oh, wow, shannon.
Tactful much?

19:59.799 --> 20:02.533
You and max are a real pair.

20:02.668 --> 20:03.734
Are you...?

20:03.869 --> 20:05.736
Not even going to ask.

20:09.909 --> 20:12.743
You're going to look good
pregnant.

20:18.051 --> 20:20.117
I'm pretty excited to be
<i> bubbling with tom.</i>

20:20.119 --> 20:21.551
<i> He seems...</i>
S'up?

20:21.588 --> 20:24.355
Oh my god!
How long have you been here?

20:24.357 --> 20:26.924
Don't know. I took three
melatonins, and I passed out.

20:26.926 --> 20:28.925
Nikki doesn't live here anymore.

20:28.962 --> 20:30.895
Oh, that's chill.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.563
So, are you gonna leave, or...

20:32.632 --> 20:36.967
Oh! They put jacqueline with
monika? That's fire.

20:37.003 --> 20:38.669
You like love bubble?

20:38.671 --> 20:39.803
Oh, yeah, it's the best.

20:39.839 --> 20:41.872
You know they based this off a
study with mice?

20:42.008 --> 20:43.607
Except all the mice went nuts.

20:43.676 --> 20:45.643
(chuckling)
oh.

20:45.645 --> 20:48.145
Hey, uh, this is embarrassing,
but...

20:48.181 --> 20:49.880
Oh, your boxer shorts?
I washed them.

20:49.949 --> 20:51.682
Oh, no, no. Peg does that.

20:51.817 --> 20:52.950
I just want to say,

20:53.085 --> 20:56.354
I sort of... Look up to you.

20:56.489 --> 20:57.554
Sorry?

20:57.624 --> 20:59.222
You've got your own place,
solid job,

20:59.259 --> 21:00.558
You're following your dreams.

21:00.693 --> 21:03.627
You know, that ain't easy.
I respect that.

21:03.630 --> 21:07.164
Oh. Thank you. You have great
taste in reality tv.

21:07.233 --> 21:10.434
Yeah. Though I do mainly
watch it for the spank bank.

21:10.569 --> 21:14.238
Like, linda?
Phew! Locked and loaded.

21:14.373 --> 21:16.073
Okay, time to go.
Thank you.

21:16.208 --> 21:20.243
Oh. You're welcome.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.012
