Previously on
Teen Wolf...

00:02.879 --> 00:04.335
Remember, no wolf powers.

00:04.547 --> 00:05.957
No super-fast reflexes.

00:08.593 --> 00:11.835
From here on out, immediately, we're
switching to co-capâ€™rains.

00:12.013 --> 00:13.093
Congratulations, McCall.

00:15.475 --> 00:16.430
Was that your first kiss?

00:20.480 --> 00:22.687
You're a katana-wielding,
badass kitsune.

00:24.275 --> 00:25.435
And he couldn't be more into you.

00:27.403 --> 00:30.361
Kate took him back to
the age where he still knew her.

00:30.573 --> 00:31.653
When he still trusted her.

00:32.408 --> 00:34.023
They took it while I was blinded.

00:34.243 --> 00:35.653
- Took what?
- Bearer bonds.

00:35.870 --> 00:37.906
- Are you saying you got robbed?
- This was a heist.

00:38.414 --> 00:39.403
Somebody planned this.

01:07.443 --> 01:08.558
Willow!

01:12.907 --> 01:14.113
Willow!

01:27.797 --> 01:28.957
Mom, I can't find her.

01:36.472 --> 01:37.461
Mom?

01:53.239 --> 01:54.570
I'm going to bed.

03:11.651 --> 03:12.766
Hey, you.

03:13.569 --> 03:15.275
What are you doing under there?

04:34.358 --> 04:36.064
Hello, Sean.

04:37.278 --> 04:39.064
I just killed your family.

04:40.489 --> 04:43.105
Do you want to die like them?

04:43.284 --> 04:45.195
Begging for your life?

04:45.369 --> 04:47.075
Or do you want to fight?

04:47.872 --> 04:49.908
I'll give you some help.

04:50.124 --> 04:52.490
Wrap a towel around your fist,

04:52.710 --> 04:54.246
smash the mirror.

04:54.462 --> 04:57.420
Use one of the shards
to defend yourself.

04:58.758 --> 05:01.795
Go ahead. I'm waiting.

05:12.146 --> 05:13.932
Are you ready, Sean?

05:14.648 --> 05:16.684
Because here I come.

06:18.128 --> 06:19.629
That table's Italian.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.040
So are these boots.

06:21.966 --> 06:23.877
Are we going
to talk interior design and fashion,

06:24.093 --> 06:25.674
or are we going to talk numbers?

06:49.827 --> 06:50.942
We're hiring you to find Kate,

06:51.161 --> 06:52.537
not assassinate the President.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.613
I was hired by the Calaveras
to find Kate.

06:55.833 --> 06:57.289
You're hiring me to find her first.

06:57.501 --> 06:59.958
Going against the Calaveras
is what's going to cost you.

07:10.014 --> 07:10.924
We'll pay.

07:11.974 --> 07:13.805
Just find Kate, that's all we want.

07:20.524 --> 07:21.900
Are you insane?

07:22.151 --> 07:23.186
We don't have a choice.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.692
We spent a week looking
for her and came up with nothing.

07:25.905 --> 07:26.940
If we don't find out

07:27.156 --> 07:29.488
who told Kate about the vault,

07:29.700 --> 07:30.940
we don't get those bonds back!

07:31.160 --> 07:33.321
What do you think
I'm gonna do then, huh?

07:33.537 --> 07:34.492
Get a job?

07:35.164 --> 07:37.280
My resume is slightly out of date.

07:37.833 --> 07:39.789
We got robbed, Derek.

07:40.377 --> 07:41.287
Robbed!

07:44.673 --> 07:46.049
Oh, that's a new look for you.

07:48.218 --> 07:50.129
What happened to your eyes?

07:50.554 --> 07:51.964
I don't know.

07:53.682 --> 07:55.889
But I'm willing to pay to find out.

07:57.436 --> 07:58.892
Of course you're still
the team captain.

07:59.104 --> 08:00.844
You got your grades
up just like Coach told you to, right?

08:01.065 --> 08:03.272
Yeah, but he never told
me I was back on the team.

08:03.484 --> 08:04.815
He just told me to show up
at tryouts today.

08:05.027 --> 08:06.733
We got bigger things
to deal with anyway.

08:06.946 --> 08:07.856
Did you tell Argent yet?

08:08.072 --> 08:10.313
Ah, I texted him but
he didn't get back to me.

08:10.532 --> 08:13.319
You told him his sister Kate
came back from the dead over a text?

08:14.620 --> 08:16.531
I didn't have the money to call France.

08:16.705 --> 08:18.115
Yeah, you think you
got money problems?

08:18.290 --> 08:20.326
Try paying for an MRI
and a visit to Eichen House.

08:20.542 --> 08:21.452
Another notice?

08:21.669 --> 08:23.580
Yeah, this one said, "Final."

08:23.796 --> 08:25.252
Now, what the hell are we even
doing here anyway?

08:25.422 --> 08:27.287
We got, like, 117 million problems

08:27.508 --> 08:29.715
and worrying about our status
on the lacrosse team is not one of them.

08:31.512 --> 08:32.672
It is now.

08:56.787 --> 08:57.867
Who the hell is that?

09:04.628 --> 09:05.788
Nice, Liam.

09:06.255 --> 09:08.166
You mightjust be our
first ever freshman captain.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.675
Okay, maybe we should just
practice a little bit.

09:15.764 --> 09:17.595
The nursing staff's
already spread too thin.

09:17.808 --> 09:19.344
I know. There's never
a good place to make cuts,

09:19.560 --> 09:22.302
but this hospital has seen
a bizarre amount of damage

09:22.521 --> 09:24.102
and the insurance
isn't going to cover it.

09:24.314 --> 09:25.599
We have to cut back.

09:25.816 --> 09:28.023
Maybe I can pull some
money from Pediatrics.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.566
Your shift is over.

09:29.778 --> 09:31.359
I'm exhausted
just looking at you.

09:31.572 --> 09:33.904
- Please go home and get some sleep.
- Okay.

09:34.700 --> 09:36.236
I need to get some dinner first.

09:36.410 --> 09:37.775
Melissa.

09:37.995 --> 09:39.280
It's 7:00 am.

10:11.236 --> 10:14.023
Now I know why he hasn't spoken
a word to the psychologist yet.

10:14.239 --> 10:16.446
He's going
to be in shock for a while, isn't he?

10:18.619 --> 10:19.984
This was his whole family?

10:21.246 --> 10:23.783
Mother, father, older brother.

10:23.999 --> 10:26.832
Sean was the youngest.
And the only one that got away.

10:27.461 --> 10:28.792
The question is from what?

10:29.838 --> 10:30.793
From who?

10:31.006 --> 10:33.042
These wounds weren't caused
by claws and fangs.

10:33.258 --> 10:35.044
These are deep cuts,

10:35.260 --> 10:37.296
a combination of sharp
and blunt force trauma.

10:37.513 --> 10:40.255
That's what the ME said.
Some kind of ax.

10:41.058 --> 10:43.140
ljust need to make
sure that we didn't have to, uh...

10:43.352 --> 10:45.058
- Involve the boys?
- Yeah.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.056
If this is everyday homicide

10:47.272 --> 10:49.183
instead of the supernatural kind,

10:49.399 --> 10:50.775
then maybe we can
give them the day off

10:50.984 --> 10:53.066
from the world of
murder and massacres.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.026
When do we get a day off?

11:03.622 --> 11:06.329
- Your father's waiting for you outside.
- I know, I know!

11:12.798 --> 11:13.787
What is this?

11:14.675 --> 11:15.790
A "For sale" sign.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.091
It lets people know
your house is for sale.

11:18.303 --> 11:19.918
I thought you were going to talk to her.

11:20.472 --> 11:22.508
Kira, we told you this was temporary.

11:22.724 --> 11:24.510
That was after you
told me I was a kitsune,

11:24.726 --> 11:26.227
and was going to have
to destroy a dark spirit

11:26.436 --> 11:29.223
by stabbing and killing one of the few
friends I've made in this town.

11:29.439 --> 11:31.725
And you didn't have to.
I call that a win.

11:31.942 --> 11:33.102
We're not going back to New York.

11:33.318 --> 11:34.694
And why would we stay?

11:34.903 --> 11:36.279
Because...

11:37.364 --> 11:38.444
Well,

11:38.657 --> 11:40.989
Dad's a very
important teacher at the high school.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.112
In New York, I was a professor
at Columbia.

11:44.288 --> 11:46.825
- You'll make new friends.
- Not like these.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.576
You don't know them like I do.

11:48.792 --> 11:52.250
Lydia, Stiles, Malia.

11:53.547 --> 11:54.502
And Scott?

11:55.966 --> 11:56.955
Who?

12:00.345 --> 12:02.085
He wasn't your first boyfriend

12:02.306 --> 12:03.591
and he won't be your last.

12:08.103 --> 12:09.764
He's not my boyfriend.

12:16.028 --> 12:19.486
Hey, Liam. You want to explain
what that was out there?

12:20.324 --> 12:23.111
- What do you mean?
- That little display. Your little circus act.

12:23.327 --> 12:24.316
What circus act?

12:24.661 --> 12:25.946
You caught every shot.

12:26.914 --> 12:28.074
I was in goal.

12:28.248 --> 12:31.035
Yeah, but nothing,
not a single shot got past you.

12:31.210 --> 12:32.746
Yeah, I was the goalie.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.039
You guys played this game before?

12:35.214 --> 12:37.421
- You're a freshman, right?
- Yeah.

12:37.633 --> 12:39.294
But you weren't
here last semester.

12:40.219 --> 12:41.584
I transferred from Devenford Prep.

12:44.806 --> 12:46.216
You transferred?

12:46.725 --> 12:47.760
Yeah.

12:49.311 --> 12:51.097
No, you got kicked out, didn't you?

12:53.357 --> 12:55.894
All right, look, kicked out, transferred,
what do you guys care?

12:56.068 --> 12:57.854
I came here to play lacrosse.

12:58.737 --> 13:00.602
The team could use
a few good players, right?

13:00.781 --> 13:02.817
No. No, we don't need
any more good players.

13:02.991 --> 13:04.982
Actually, we could sort of use a couple.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.576
Okay, how'd you get this good?
Have you always been this good?

13:08.789 --> 13:11.405
Or did it suddenly happen
just once over night?

13:11.583 --> 13:12.868
Have you ever been out
in the middle of the woods

13:13.085 --> 13:15.041
- during the night of a full...
- Stiles.

13:16.797 --> 13:19.129
Look, I learned
from my stepfather, all right?

13:20.175 --> 13:22.131
He made team captain
when he was a sophomore.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.462
Like you.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.635
And, yeah,

13:28.558 --> 13:30.094
I guess I'm just that good.

13:33.689 --> 13:35.145
He wasn't lying that time.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.448
- I hate math. It's pointless.
- It's school.

13:54.668 --> 13:57.330
School is important,
and math is essential.

13:57.546 --> 13:58.535
To what?

13:58.755 --> 14:00.711
Knowing how much
to tip at restaurants.

14:02.801 --> 14:06.919
And less important things like
medicine, economics, engineering.

14:07.681 --> 14:08.591
Tipping.

14:08.807 --> 14:10.513
All right,
volunteers to the board.

14:10.726 --> 14:12.432
Lydia, Diego, Malia.

14:13.770 --> 14:15.726
Um...
I didn't volunteer.

14:15.981 --> 14:17.596
You did now. To the board.

14:34.458 --> 14:36.198
Did you go over the notes
I gave you?

14:37.127 --> 14:38.082
I didn't understand them.

14:45.344 --> 14:46.550
"X" equals 25.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.177
And, sweetheart?

14:52.851 --> 14:53.806
Put away the claws.

15:04.613 --> 15:05.523
An ax murderer?

15:05.739 --> 15:07.650
A family-murdering ax murderer.

15:07.866 --> 15:10.152
- I already heard about it.
- Wait. What? You did? How?

15:10.369 --> 15:11.950
My mom called me.
She knew we'd see it on the news.

15:12.162 --> 15:13.368
- Perfect. Let's go.
- Whoa, whoa.

15:13.580 --> 15:14.820
We've got econ in five minutes.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.029
Right. Did you forget the part

15:16.249 --> 15:17.750
about the family-murdering
ax murderer?

15:17.959 --> 15:19.244
Did you forget
that your dad's the Sheriff?

15:19.419 --> 15:20.795
They want us to stay out of it.

15:21.004 --> 15:21.868
Are you guys kidding me?

15:22.089 --> 15:22.999
There's a family-murdering
ax murderer

15:23.215 --> 15:24.250
and we're not going
to do anything about it?

15:24.424 --> 15:26.085
Maybe we should just
let the adults handle it.

15:28.970 --> 15:30.585
So the two of you, you just
want to stay here,

15:30.806 --> 15:31.966
school, go to class.

15:33.475 --> 15:35.215
Never heard anything
so irresponsible in my life.

15:35.477 --> 15:36.842
See you at tryouts?

15:38.980 --> 15:40.356
Hey, so that thing you
wanted to talk about?

15:40.565 --> 15:42.601
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Can we talk later? After tryouts?

15:42.818 --> 15:44.058
Do you mind waiting?
It won't be that long.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.233
Um... I...

15:46.947 --> 15:47.902
Sure.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.896
Great. See you then.

16:01.628 --> 16:02.834
Oh, God.

16:48.049 --> 16:50.426
I said I don't want anyone else on site.

16:50.594 --> 16:53.085
Review the photos.
And don't blame me for the nightmares.

16:53.305 --> 16:55.387
But, Sheriff, don't
you feel like we're missing something?

16:55.557 --> 16:57.138
Yeah. And that's why Agent McCall

16:57.350 --> 16:59.090
is bringing in an expert from Quantico

16:59.311 --> 17:01.893
who deals with exactly this kind of thing.

17:02.063 --> 17:04.349
- You mean the US Marshal?
- What US Marshal?

17:04.566 --> 17:06.147
I called about the case file.

17:10.363 --> 17:13.275
It was our first kiss since
our actual first kiss.

17:13.450 --> 17:16.738
- That's good. You kissed her.
- I did. But I didn't.

17:16.912 --> 17:18.743
Was... Was it on the lips?

17:18.955 --> 17:19.944
Yeah.

17:20.749 --> 17:21.829
Was there tongue?

17:22.292 --> 17:25.375
No. I... It was like how you kiss
your grandmother when you're five.

17:25.545 --> 17:28.378
Oh, chaste.
You gave her a chaste kiss.

17:28.798 --> 17:30.663
Yeah, and now it's all weird.

17:30.842 --> 17:32.673
It's all completely weird and...

17:32.886 --> 17:34.547
I don't know what to do.

17:35.388 --> 17:38.596
- Maybe I should text her.
- No. Just no with the texts.

17:41.102 --> 17:43.969
As a reminder,
it's an open tryout today.

17:44.189 --> 17:45.725
All positions available.

17:46.316 --> 17:48.102
This is a rebuilding season, people.

17:48.318 --> 17:50.980
Jackson's gone, Lahey's gone.

17:51.196 --> 17:54.279
Greenberg, the one guy
I actually wanted gone,

17:54.491 --> 17:56.698
was held back. Again.

17:56.910 --> 17:58.616
Get your asses on the field!

18:00.747 --> 18:01.987
Hey, Coach.

18:02.207 --> 18:04.118
| just wanted to ask if

18:04.334 --> 18:07.417
I was still... If I'm... You know.

18:07.629 --> 18:09.540
You're on the team, McCall.

18:09.756 --> 18:10.916
But am I

18:11.132 --> 18:13.589
everything that I was
on the team before?

18:15.428 --> 18:17.214
All positions are open.

18:45.750 --> 18:47.035
Terrible.

18:47.252 --> 18:48.287
Horrifying.

18:48.461 --> 18:49.587
Pathetic.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.203
Unbelievably pathetic.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.005
Is that everyone?

18:59.723 --> 19:01.714
Yep, that's everyone.

19:03.476 --> 19:04.602
I got you.

19:05.729 --> 19:06.969
Who came in first?

19:09.441 --> 19:10.977
Is he even human?

19:11.192 --> 19:14.229
What is he, like, a were-cheetah?
Does it even exist? Is that a thing?

19:14.404 --> 19:15.814
I think he's just that good.

19:16.031 --> 19:17.316
I'm gonna puke,
take me somewhere.

19:17.490 --> 19:18.400
Okay, come on.

19:22.579 --> 19:23.694
What's wrong with you?

19:24.205 --> 19:26.116
Me? Nothing.

19:27.042 --> 19:29.749
You reek of anxiety.
And it's distracting.

19:29.961 --> 19:31.167
What's going on?

19:32.047 --> 19:33.912
Scott and I sort of
had this thing happen.

19:34.132 --> 19:35.417
But it wasn't much of a thing.

19:35.634 --> 19:38.296
And I'm starting to think
it never was anything

19:38.470 --> 19:39.425
at all.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.215
What do you want it to be?

19:42.932 --> 19:44.058
More.

20:13.630 --> 20:15.120
You know,
maybe he's only good in goal.

20:24.974 --> 20:26.009
Yes!

20:28.561 --> 20:30.813
Maybe he's just
perfect at everything. I hate this kid!

20:31.606 --> 20:34.564
You don't have to hate him.
The team needs new players.

20:34.776 --> 20:36.482
What about a new team captain?

21:02.345 --> 21:04.051
- Nice, McCall.
- Hey, Garrett.

21:04.472 --> 21:05.427
Shut up!

21:24.784 --> 21:27.526
Isn't the captain supposed to be
one of the best players on the team?

21:28.830 --> 21:29.819
Or good?

21:33.710 --> 21:35.496
- Dude, what is going on with you?
- I don't know.

21:35.670 --> 21:38.332
- I'm having a really off day.
- Off day? You were dying out there!

21:38.548 --> 21:41.381
- I feel actual physical pain watching you.
- I didn't see you make any shots.

21:41.551 --> 21:43.712
Yes, that is because
I'm terrible, though, Scott.

21:43.887 --> 21:44.967
You... You are the Alpha.

21:45.138 --> 21:46.844
Not on the field.
I'm a human on the field.

21:47.015 --> 21:49.097
Well, human you
is kind of sucking at the moment.

21:49.267 --> 21:50.222
So do you think there is any way

21:50.435 --> 21:52.426
you can use just, like,
a little tiny bit of wolf power?

21:52.896 --> 21:54.887
- It's cheating.
- I know it is!

21:55.064 --> 21:56.850
It's just... I hate seeing this little

21:57.025 --> 21:59.061
freshman come in
and steal all your glory

21:59.235 --> 22:02.022
- after you worked your tushie off. I hate it.
- He's not going to steal all the glory.

22:04.657 --> 22:07.444
- Yes! Hot damn! Yeah!
- There you go!

22:21.216 --> 22:22.171
Hustle!

22:22.550 --> 22:24.290
McCall and Stilinski,

22:24.469 --> 22:27.006
grab the long sticks.
You're covering goal for two-on-ones.

22:27.222 --> 22:28.257
Let's go! Line it up!

22:30.016 --> 22:31.631
We still don't know
if he's a werewolf, too.

22:31.851 --> 22:34.308
And if he is, he'd just be cheating.
And we'd just be cheating the cheater.

22:34.479 --> 22:37.892
He's not. I'd know.
I'd be able to catch a scent or something.

22:38.441 --> 22:39.772
Maybe you need to get closer.

22:42.237 --> 22:43.647
I think I'm about to get my chance.

23:06.177 --> 23:07.166
That's my boys!

23:07.387 --> 23:08.297
Yes!

23:11.474 --> 23:13.339
Those two are like sons to me.

23:37.792 --> 23:39.373
That's how you do it!

23:39.586 --> 23:41.201
That's how it's done!

24:28.384 --> 24:29.760
That was luck!

24:30.511 --> 24:32.342
Oh, no, Malia. Don't get involved.

24:32.555 --> 24:33.465
Do-over!

24:33.681 --> 24:35.888
Sweetheart, there's no do-overs.
This is a practice.

24:36.100 --> 24:37.806
Ten bucks on Scott and Stiles.

24:38.019 --> 24:38.974
I'll take that action.

24:39.187 --> 24:41.143
Hey! Get back in there, Liam.

25:18.309 --> 25:20.140
Don't move! Don't touch him!

25:21.437 --> 25:23.143
I'm okay, Coach. I'm all right.

25:27.610 --> 25:29.271
I think it's my leg.

25:29.487 --> 25:30.772
I think we better
get him to the nurse.

25:34.158 --> 25:35.694
You guys take a lap.

25:36.202 --> 25:38.864
Run...
Start running around the field!

25:39.080 --> 25:40.035
Stupid!

25:45.086 --> 25:45.996
Oh!

25:47.296 --> 25:49.252
Wow! Nice catch.

25:50.675 --> 25:51.630
Throw it back.

25:57.265 --> 25:58.220
Oh, my God.

25:58.391 --> 26:01.383
Someone ask her if she's
ever played lacrosse.

26:31.007 --> 26:33.214
Beacon County Sheriff's Department!

26:33.384 --> 26:35.420
This is a crime scene. Show yourself.

26:51.819 --> 26:55.232
There's nothing in here about Kate.
This killer used an ax.

26:55.990 --> 26:58.402
Actually, he used a military tomahawk.

27:01.370 --> 27:02.496
That's not in this report.

27:03.164 --> 27:04.199
I know.

27:05.041 --> 27:06.781
Are you going to tell me
what else you know?

27:06.959 --> 27:09.245
Not yet.
'Cause I don't really know much.

27:09.420 --> 27:10.660
But you know something.

27:12.507 --> 27:14.088
Maybe.

27:15.259 --> 27:17.545
The problem is,
the people I need to talk to right now,

27:17.762 --> 27:19.377
don't talk to people like you.

27:19.722 --> 27:21.178
You want me to wait for you?

27:23.267 --> 27:24.768
I want you to trust me.

27:25.853 --> 27:28.720
And why would I trust you?
I don't know anything about you.

27:29.982 --> 27:31.518
Yeah, well, I know you.

27:33.361 --> 27:35.147
And I know what you really want.

27:40.576 --> 27:42.692
You want what Kate stole from you.

27:48.668 --> 27:51.250
It means, "The true nature of someone
is reflected in their eyes."

27:51.546 --> 27:53.662
In your case,

27:53.881 --> 27:55.462
the color of your eyes.

28:07.895 --> 28:09.226
You get a week.

28:24.829 --> 28:27.912
Hey, sorry about all that.
We're taking Liam to the hospital.

28:28.082 --> 28:30.368
It might be a sprain,
it could also be a break.

28:30.585 --> 28:32.951
It's okay. I get it.
We can talk later?

28:37.133 --> 28:38.714
And I'm sorry about before.

28:39.218 --> 28:40.799
Before before.

28:41.012 --> 28:43.378
When I did that
thing in the hallway.

28:44.640 --> 28:46.505
It's fine. Totally okay.

28:47.185 --> 28:50.097
I didn't mean to make things awkward.
Or weird.

28:51.564 --> 28:53.520
Really, I'm sorry.

29:18.090 --> 29:20.297
You know what? I'm not sorry.

29:46.244 --> 29:47.575
Text me later?

30:00.299 --> 30:01.960
I would try to explain it,

30:02.176 --> 30:05.213
but I've never gotten
a satisfactory explanation myself.

30:06.055 --> 30:07.465
Just an unusual habit of showing up

30:07.640 --> 30:09.881
at places where
people have been brutally murdered?

30:13.938 --> 30:16.475
- Are you saying I have a reputation?
- An unusual one.

30:18.067 --> 30:19.307
Maybe you're psychic.

30:21.362 --> 30:23.148
Don't tell me you believe all that?

30:27.952 --> 30:29.908
I'd like to say I don't believe in anything.

30:30.663 --> 30:32.324
But I keep an open mind.

30:34.083 --> 30:36.495
But if you're looking for dead bodies,
I think you're a little late.

31:59.335 --> 32:00.950
I think it's a game locker.

32:01.712 --> 32:02.827
Like venison.

32:03.798 --> 32:06.915
Hunting's legal
in some parts of the state, but...

32:13.849 --> 32:15.225
What is it?

32:20.189 --> 32:21.474
It's not venison.

32:32.201 --> 32:34.032
Are you sure you don't
want to eat something?

32:35.204 --> 32:36.159
Yes.

32:37.540 --> 32:38.575
Okay.

32:41.293 --> 32:42.954
Let me know if you need anything.

32:44.547 --> 32:46.708
There's a deputy
standing right outside.

32:57.476 --> 32:59.717
Uh... Hi, Mom.

33:02.231 --> 33:04.472
Don't worry, Liam.
We'll take good care of you.

33:08.529 --> 33:10.520
I got to get going.
I promised Malia I'd help her study.

33:11.073 --> 33:13.189
Sure. I want to check on him anyway.

33:15.494 --> 33:18.076
Hey, I don't need
to say that wasn't your fault, right?

33:19.165 --> 33:20.200
I don't know.

33:21.459 --> 33:24.371
Scott, if you had used any wolf power,
that kid wouldn't be limping,

33:24.545 --> 33:26.957
he'd be crawling
back to the other half of his body.

33:27.548 --> 33:29.038
If I hadn't been so worried
about being captain,

33:29.258 --> 33:30.293
he wouldn't be hurt either.

33:33.762 --> 33:36.970
It's okay to want something
for yourself once in a while.

33:39.059 --> 33:40.970
Team captain, Alpha werewolf.

33:43.939 --> 33:45.554
You're still only human.

33:55.576 --> 33:57.862
Ken, would you
please call the real estate agent

33:58.078 --> 34:01.411
and ask him why not a single person
has come to this open house?

34:01.624 --> 34:03.080
I think I know why.

34:06.879 --> 34:08.244
Kira!

34:16.096 --> 34:17.882
Hey, we're not finished yet.

34:18.766 --> 34:20.051
Yes, we are.

34:24.939 --> 34:25.894
Okay.

34:27.107 --> 34:29.018
I promised I'd help you study.

34:30.736 --> 34:32.067
Then we can go back to that.

34:33.280 --> 34:34.531
Lots of that.

34:36.408 --> 34:37.614
Like, so much...

34:44.166 --> 34:45.952
What's with
all the highlighters anyway?

34:46.627 --> 34:48.993
Green is for the things I understand.

34:49.213 --> 34:51.420
Yellow is for, "I'm working on it."

34:51.632 --> 34:52.872
And

34:54.885 --> 34:56.466
red means I have no clue.

34:57.263 --> 34:58.628
I'm mostly using red.

35:15.239 --> 35:17.070
Study first, remember?

35:24.248 --> 35:25.658
So, what's the secret?

35:25.958 --> 35:30.076
Why is math impossible for me
and easy for you guys?

35:30.296 --> 35:32.002
Because we usually use notes.

35:32.214 --> 35:34.375
Then somebody needs
to give me notes on Lydia's notes,

35:34.592 --> 35:36.924
because I don't understand any of this.

35:37.136 --> 35:38.046
Okay.

35:39.054 --> 35:40.339
Um...

35:43.392 --> 35:46.680
- Lydia wrote these?
- Yeah. What are they?

35:50.608 --> 35:51.893
They're not math.

35:58.240 --> 35:59.616
Okay, okay, just...

36:05.205 --> 36:06.615
It's broken, isn't it?

36:07.333 --> 36:09.164
It's definitely going to need an X-ray.

36:09.793 --> 36:11.499
It's broken. And it's my fault.

36:13.130 --> 36:14.666
You want to tell me what happened?

36:17.134 --> 36:18.874
I went up against two juniors.

36:22.473 --> 36:24.384
One of them is captain of the team.

36:26.935 --> 36:29.096
Remember what we always say?

36:30.773 --> 36:32.559
Play smart, not hard.

36:35.819 --> 36:37.195
Are you mad at me?

36:37.571 --> 36:39.653
No, of course not.

36:41.033 --> 36:43.524
Your mom might be mad at me
for getting you into lacrosse,

36:43.702 --> 36:46.114
but maybe we should both wait
for the X-ray before we panic.

36:46.455 --> 36:49.868
And trust me,
I have more reason to panic than you.

36:52.002 --> 36:53.378
It's not over yet.

36:56.256 --> 36:57.587
Wait for the X-ray.

37:09.478 --> 37:10.809
- Hey, Lydia.
- Where are you?

37:10.979 --> 37:12.685
I couldn't call...
I couldn't get away from the deputy.

37:12.898 --> 37:14.013
Okay, slow down.

37:14.233 --> 37:16.565
You need to get to the hospital.
You need to get there right now.

37:16.777 --> 37:18.608
The son,
the only one who survived,

37:18.779 --> 37:19.894
he's there.

37:20.656 --> 37:22.271
So am I. I'm at the hospital, too.

37:22.491 --> 37:25.449
Then find him. Find Sean Walcott.

37:26.745 --> 37:28.281
Sean, are you awake?

37:29.248 --> 37:31.534
The Sheriff's on his way.
I'm going to need you to wake up.

37:47.474 --> 37:50.762
I couldn't help it. I'm so hungry.

37:51.729 --> 37:54.971
I'm just so hungry!

38:01.238 --> 38:02.648
Wait! Hold the doors!

38:10.748 --> 38:12.454
I think I'm ready to talk now.

38:15.794 --> 38:17.375
No!

38:18.297 --> 38:20.162
Leave me alone! No!

38:42.196 --> 38:44.312
I'm okay. I'm all right.

38:44.531 --> 38:47.318
- Are you sure?
- Go get that son of a bitch.

38:53.207 --> 38:54.367
Hey!

38:54.833 --> 38:56.369
Anyone hear that?

38:59.171 --> 39:00.752
I thought I heard someone...

39:14.186 --> 39:15.175
Get back!

39:15.395 --> 39:17.056
Don't! You don't need to do this.

39:17.272 --> 39:19.183
Whatever it is, whatever you are,

39:19.358 --> 39:20.473
we can help you.

39:20.692 --> 39:21.977
No, you can't.

39:22.778 --> 39:24.063
Let me help you.

39:25.030 --> 39:26.941
Wendigos don't need help.

39:27.157 --> 39:28.567
We need food!

39:28.951 --> 39:30.316
Oh, God!

39:51.431 --> 39:52.762
No! No!

39:59.022 --> 40:00.102
No!

40:00.315 --> 40:01.270
No!

40:03.610 --> 40:04.986
I can't hold on!
