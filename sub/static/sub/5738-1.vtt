02:08.900 --> 02:11.500
Jackson, you going to go to Hong Kong?

02:11.600 --> 02:14.900
I love anything full-contact.
I need a few more scars on my face.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.800
I heard you can get killed at that kumite.

02:16.800 --> 02:18.500
Only if you fuck up.

02:30.200 --> 02:32.500
Tomorrow we leave for the kumite.

02:51.700 --> 02:52.800
Sir?

02:54.200 --> 02:55.400
Excuse me.

02:55.500 --> 02:58.000
Col. Cooke would like to see you
before you leave.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.700
What's the problem?

03:00.000 --> 03:03.500
He found out you're going to Hong Kong.
He wants to talk to you about it.

03:03.600 --> 03:06.700
Tell him I'll be right there
after I take a shower.

03:06.900 --> 03:08.900
But I'll have to wait, sir.

03:09.100 --> 03:10.200
Okay.

03:14.600 --> 03:16.800
What's taking so long, Captain?

03:18.600 --> 03:19.700
Captain?

03:30.200 --> 03:31.200
Shit!

03:49.500 --> 03:50.500
Sir!

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Where's Dux?

03:52.200 --> 03:53.600
He was at the gym, like you said.

03:53.700 --> 03:55.800
He took a shower,
I waited, and he disappeared.

03:55.900 --> 03:57.200
What do you mean, disappeared?

03:57.200 --> 03:59.000
One minute he's there, then gone.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
Jesus Christ!
If anything happens to Dux in Hong Kong...

04:02.100 --> 04:03.900
Get Helmer and Rawlins
on this right away.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
And I don't want to see your face again
until Dux is beside it!

04:07.000 --> 04:07.800
Understand?

04:26.600 --> 04:27.500
How is he?

04:27.600 --> 04:30.600
He's resting now.
He'll be so happy to see you.

04:30.800 --> 04:33.000
It's so good to be here again.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.600
I'll tell him you are here.

04:38.700 --> 04:40.000
Thank you.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.300
Look at the sword!

05:07.500 --> 05:08.600
Let's get it.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.400
Come on, Frank.
What's the matter, you chicken?

05:11.500 --> 05:13.200
- No.
- Then get in here.

05:13.600 --> 05:16.600
Frank, you want to hang out with us,
then come on!

05:19.600 --> 05:22.600
You just going to stand there,
or are you going to grab something?

05:22.700 --> 05:25.500
Shit! They're coming back!
Let's get out of here!

05:25.600 --> 05:27.000
Come on, Frank!

05:27.000 --> 05:28.800
Forget him! Let's go!

05:46.600 --> 05:48.400
That's enough, Shingo.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.200
Go to your studies.

05:59.800 --> 06:02.400
You cannot get katana sword by stealing.

06:03.700 --> 06:05.700
It is a very special sword.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.000
You must earn it.

06:09.300 --> 06:11.300
I wasrt going to steal it.

06:16.600 --> 06:19.500
You didn't flinch. You have fighting spirit.

06:19.900 --> 06:22.100
You're not gonna call the cops?

06:22.400 --> 06:24.200
Not if we make a deal.

06:24.600 --> 06:26.300
What kind of a deal?

06:26.600 --> 06:29.300
Your son and my son
are in the same school.

06:30.200 --> 06:32.300
Frank sees my sors skill...

06:33.200 --> 06:36.200
...and he desires
to learn martial science, too.

06:36.500 --> 06:39.300
Yes, but what do you mean
by martial science?

06:40.900 --> 06:44.600
Frank has told me
you came to America to grow vines.

06:45.100 --> 06:47.400
Yes, that's right.
I work at the Verne vineyard.

06:47.400 --> 06:50.000
I came here to grow fish in my hatchery.

06:51.600 --> 06:53.400
We both grow children.

06:53.600 --> 06:56.200
You use science
to make vines grow better.

06:57.200 --> 06:59.800
Like vines, children need training.

07:00.900 --> 07:03.700
Martial science provides a way of training.

07:04.400 --> 07:08.100
It brings mind, body, spirit together.

07:13.500 --> 07:16.000
That's enough. That's all for today.

07:16.200 --> 07:17.300
Not yet.

07:17.800 --> 07:19.900
Why don't you quit, round-eye?

07:20.800 --> 07:22.000
Not yet.

07:23.700 --> 07:25.500
Go practice your katas.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.600
How come you coach him, but not me?

07:30.100 --> 07:32.000
I brought you here
to help me train my son.

07:32.100 --> 07:33.200
Don't question me!

07:33.300 --> 07:36.700
If you expect me to be his punching bag,
you can forget about our deal.

07:59.400 --> 08:00.700
Someday...

08:01.300 --> 08:04.500
...I'll fight in the kumite
and make my father proud.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.600
Shidoshi, I feel like
I've lost part of my family, too.

08:19.200 --> 08:23.600
Shingo and I were close friends,
like brothers.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.200
And you and Mrs. Tanaka...

08:26.600 --> 08:29.900
...have treated me like a son.

08:35.100 --> 08:36.200
What will happen now?

08:38.200 --> 08:39.700
No more training.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.299
I stop now.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.600
But you have so much to teach.

08:50.400 --> 08:52.200
You don't understand.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.800
In the war, I lost my first family...

08:57.200 --> 09:00.500
...my son, daughter, and wife.

09:03.900 --> 09:05.800
They lived in Hiroshima.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.400
I left Japan because of the war.

09:12.500 --> 09:13.900
War was wrong.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.700
I came here to start over...

09:18.900 --> 09:21.400
...begin a new family, have a son...

09:22.600 --> 09:25.400
...another chance to pass on the teaching.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.100
For 2,000 years...

09:29.300 --> 09:32.000
...knowledge passed from father to son...

09:32.200 --> 09:33.700
...father to son.

09:37.300 --> 09:38.900
When Shingo died...

09:40.100 --> 09:41.500
...it stopped.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.500
Teach me. I can do it.

09:48.200 --> 09:51.000
You are not Japanese!
You are not a Tanaka!

09:51.400 --> 09:54.300
You taught me
using any technique that works...

09:55.000 --> 09:57.600
...never to limit myself to one style...

09:58.100 --> 10:00.000
...to keep an open mind!

10:00.600 --> 10:01.600
Why?

10:03.400 --> 10:06.100
To honor you, Shidoshi.

12:53.900 --> 12:56.200
Practice until you can meditate...

12:56.800 --> 12:58.600
...and nothing can distract you...

12:58.700 --> 13:00.800
...so that you see and feel nothing...

13:00.800 --> 13:02.800
...except your own energy.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.200
Are you awake, Shidoshi?

16:13.000 --> 16:15.200
Do you sleep with your eyes open?

16:15.600 --> 16:17.200
How are you feeling?

16:19.500 --> 16:21.200
Like an old man.

16:22.900 --> 16:24.500
And how about you?

16:27.100 --> 16:28.900
I'm going to Hong Kong.

16:29.300 --> 16:31.400
You sure you want to do this?

16:31.800 --> 16:36.200
To honor you means everything to me.

16:37.900 --> 16:40.500
I have poured all my knowledge into you.

16:41.400 --> 16:45.600
When you fight, my spirit fights with you.

16:46.900 --> 16:49.400
In kumite, you will need it.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.700
Hey, babe,
want to go out with a real big man?

17:30.200 --> 17:31.400
No, huh?

17:38.200 --> 17:40.200
Too handsome for you, honey?

17:45.500 --> 17:48.000
Is this your first time in Hong Kong?

17:48.300 --> 17:51.000
You two are here for the kumite,
aren't you?

17:51.000 --> 17:53.200
Kumite? What is kumite?

17:54.700 --> 17:57.800
Look, guys,
I know there's a secret full-contact event...

17:57.900 --> 18:00.300
...being held in Hong Kong
in the next few days.

18:00.300 --> 18:02.800
Yes. Hong Kong is an exciting city.

18:03.400 --> 18:07.300
I also happen to know a little bit
about some of your competition.

18:08.500 --> 18:09.600
Okay.

18:11.100 --> 18:13.500
Would you just tell me
how you got invited?

18:17.800 --> 18:19.200
Thanks, guys.

18:27.600 --> 18:30.500
What? Think you can
give me some competition?

18:30.900 --> 18:32.400
Sure. I'll try.

18:33.300 --> 18:36.800
That's what I like to hear,
a kid who isn't afraid to lose.

18:36.800 --> 18:39.200
No, I got it.
I don't want to take your money.

18:41.200 --> 18:42.800
- You ready?
- Yeah.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.300
- You like this kind of fighting?
- Yeah.

19:12.800 --> 19:16.400
If you want to see some real fighting,
you can see me fight at the kumite.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.600
I'm here, too, for the kumite.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.700
Arert you a little young for full-contact?

19:21.800 --> 19:24.400
Arert you a little old for video games?

19:25.600 --> 19:28.200
- You want to go at it again, huh?
- Yeah.

19:41.800 --> 19:44.000
Not bad, kid. Name's Ray Jackson.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.200
I'm Frank Dux.

19:53.400 --> 19:54.700
Mrs. Tanaka...

19:54.700 --> 19:56.200
Mrs. Tanaka?

19:56.200 --> 19:57.200
Yes?

19:57.300 --> 20:00.500
It's very important
to the government of the United States...

20:00.600 --> 20:02.200
...that we find Frank Dux.

20:02.300 --> 20:06.000
We understand that
he might have visited Mr. Tanaka recently.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.200
Mr. Tanaka is very ill.

20:08.600 --> 20:10.500
We're sorry to hear that.

20:11.100 --> 20:12.900
Was Frank here recently?

20:13.000 --> 20:15.400
Frank came here to pay his respects.

20:15.700 --> 20:17.700
- When was that?
- Two days ago.

20:17.800 --> 20:21.200
Did he say, or do you know
if he was going to Hong Kong?

20:22.000 --> 20:23.400
I don't know.

20:23.600 --> 20:25.600
Of course you know. We're not trying to...

20:25.600 --> 20:28.800
Mrs. Tanaka,
we're very sorry to have disturbed you.

20:29.400 --> 20:31.700
Thank you very much for your time.

20:38.100 --> 20:39.600
- May I help you?
- Yeah, how you doing?

20:39.700 --> 20:41.700
My name's Jackson. This is Mr. Frank Dux.

20:41.800 --> 20:42.700
Are our rooms ready?

20:42.800 --> 20:46.400
Mr. Lin in Room 310 wants to see you
after you check in.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.500
Who the hell's Mr. Lin?

20:48.600 --> 20:51.800
I'm Lin. You Jackson?
You look like a Jackson.

20:54.500 --> 20:56.300
That would make you Frank Ducks.

20:56.300 --> 20:58.500
No, no. It's Dux.

20:58.900 --> 21:01.600
Gotcha. Like "Put up your dukes," right?

21:01.700 --> 21:03.300
Okay, so here's the deal.

21:03.400 --> 21:05.400
This is the biggest kumite ever.

21:05.500 --> 21:07.600
We got fighters from all over.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.400
I've been assigned by the IFAA...

21:09.500 --> 21:12.000
...to help you
and the other North American fighters...

21:12.100 --> 21:14.000
...to find your way around.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.700
I'm gonna make sure
you guys give it your best.

21:16.800 --> 21:19.000
And don't disqualify by fighting
outside the arena.

21:20.400 --> 21:22.800
The Triad, they are like the Mafia...

21:23.400 --> 21:26.300
...is allowing us
to hold kumite here this time.

21:29.900 --> 21:32.400
Here it comes, man, the Walled City.

21:32.700 --> 21:34.600
Not a place for outsiders.

21:34.800 --> 21:36.400
You are in Hong Kong.

21:36.500 --> 21:40.400
But you are about to cross
an invisible border into mainland China.

21:40.600 --> 21:41.800
No joke, man.

21:41.900 --> 21:43.800
It's a run-down piece of no-mars-land...

21:43.900 --> 21:46.000
...in the middle of a tourist paradise.

21:46.100 --> 21:50.000
It goes back to the old lease agreement
between Great Britain and China.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.400
Once you step out of the sunlight
into the narrow corridors...

21:53.500 --> 21:56.100
...it's time to protect your nuts, guys.

22:06.600 --> 22:07.900
Okay, USA!

22:09.900 --> 22:11.200
"Okay, USA!"

24:15.100 --> 24:16.400
Okay, guys.

24:16.600 --> 24:20.100
First, you'll show the Black Dragon boys
your invitation.

24:20.300 --> 24:23.400
Then you got to qualify
and prove to them...

24:23.500 --> 24:26.400
...you can step onto the runway
and not get killed.

24:26.400 --> 24:27.600
Got it?

24:28.600 --> 24:29.900
You got it?

24:48.300 --> 24:51.000
It says he represents the Tanaka clan.

24:52.800 --> 24:54.600
You don't look like Tanaka.

24:54.700 --> 24:56.700
Shidoshi Tanaka trained me.

24:56.900 --> 24:58.100
What's the holdup?

24:58.200 --> 25:01.200
He says Senzo Tanaka is his Shidoshi.

25:01.600 --> 25:04.800
What's the difference
if Bruce Springsteen is his Shidoshi?

25:04.900 --> 25:07.400
If Senzo Tanaka is his Shidoshi...

25:07.600 --> 25:09.600
...then show us the dim mak.

25:09.900 --> 25:11.900
What the hell is a dim mak?

25:12.700 --> 25:14.000
Death touch.

25:22.200 --> 25:23.300
Thanks.

25:24.600 --> 25:26.400
Vic, choose a brick.

25:27.800 --> 25:29.200
Okay, Frank.

25:30.900 --> 25:32.600
What about this one?

25:39.700 --> 25:40.700
No!

25:43.500 --> 25:44.800
Bottom one.

26:23.500 --> 26:25.000
Son of a bitch!

26:25.200 --> 26:27.200
Is that good enough, guys?

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
We honor your invitation.

26:30.400 --> 26:32.700
No shit, you honor his invitation!

26:34.500 --> 26:36.000
That was great.

26:42.800 --> 26:46.900
Very good, but brick not hit back.

27:04.800 --> 27:07.500
Here's a picture
of the man we're looking for.

27:07.600 --> 27:09.800
His name is Frank Dux.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.200
We have reason to believe
Frank is here in Hong Kong.

27:14.500 --> 27:16.100
His name was on a list...

27:16.200 --> 27:18.400
...on a flight from San Francisco
two days ago.

27:18.400 --> 27:19.800
Two days ago?

27:19.800 --> 27:22.600
Maybe he already left,
went somewhere else.

27:22.700 --> 27:24.300
Asia's a very big place, you know.

27:24.300 --> 27:27.000
We were hoping
you'd hold onto this for reference.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.700
We're here because Frank is
fighting in the kumite...

27:29.800 --> 27:31.900
...and we're here to stop him.

27:34.500 --> 27:35.800
The kumite?

27:36.900 --> 27:37.900
Yes.

27:51.900 --> 27:53.500
Inspector Chen...

27:53.900 --> 27:57.200
...we all know the kumite
is happening here in Hong Kong.

27:57.300 --> 28:00.600
And we all know it's going on
over the next three days.

28:01.800 --> 28:04.700
All we want you to do is
pass this picture out to your men.

28:04.800 --> 28:07.600
If they spot Dux,
they give us a call at our hotel. Simple.

28:07.700 --> 28:09.600
My men already overworked.

28:10.400 --> 28:13.500
- Lf it's too much trouble, forget it...
- Inspector...

28:13.600 --> 28:16.600
We're all overworked,
but we need your help.

28:18.300 --> 28:20.200
I'll see what can be done.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.800
You know where to reach us.

28:25.300 --> 28:27.900
You'll come upstairs with me
for an interview.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.400
Like hell! Let go of me.

28:29.500 --> 28:31.000
You want Hossein, no?

28:31.100 --> 28:32.600
No. Hossein is an asshole.

28:32.700 --> 28:34.400
What did you call me?

28:34.500 --> 28:36.900
You want me to spell it out for you?

28:41.900 --> 28:43.400
Leave the girl alone.

28:43.500 --> 28:46.400
He is the American shithead
who makes tricks with bricks.

28:46.500 --> 28:49.100
Guess the kumite starts
one day earlier this year, huh?

28:49.100 --> 28:51.600
- Look, guys, let's all calm down, okay?
- No.

28:51.600 --> 28:53.500
She is coming with me upstairs.

28:53.600 --> 28:54.500
No, I'm not.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.200
If we have to fight for her...

28:56.300 --> 28:59.400
...then both of us will
be thrown out of the kumite.

29:00.500 --> 29:01.900
Just for her?

29:03.400 --> 29:05.700
We could arrange this another way.

29:06.600 --> 29:08.700
- Do you gamble?
- What is bet?

29:09.600 --> 29:11.000
You hold this.

29:11.300 --> 29:14.000
If I can grab it before you close your hand...

29:14.000 --> 29:15.600
...I get the girl.

29:16.100 --> 29:17.500
If I cannot...

29:18.600 --> 29:20.000
...she's yours.

29:20.800 --> 29:21.700
Very good.

29:21.800 --> 29:23.700
What? You can't do this!

29:24.100 --> 29:25.400
Just relax.

29:29.700 --> 29:30.900
Take it.

29:34.700 --> 29:37.700
Geez, Frankie,
I hope you know what you're doing.

29:39.300 --> 29:40.400
Ready?

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
Go.

29:47.800 --> 29:49.800
You lose, American asshole.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.800
Looks like she's mine.

30:03.200 --> 30:06.100
Now leave the lady alone.
You understand that?

30:09.700 --> 30:11.600
Why were you with Hossein?

30:13.600 --> 30:16.300
I've been trying
to get a story on the kumite.

30:16.400 --> 30:17.800
I'm a reporter.

30:20.700 --> 30:22.400
He tell you anything?

30:23.500 --> 30:25.600
He told me I had nice legs.

30:26.400 --> 30:28.000
He's right about that.

30:28.100 --> 30:31.200
Why is it that no one
will talk about the kumite?

30:31.400 --> 30:33.200
What is this air of mystery?

30:33.300 --> 30:36.000
I'm just trying to find out
what it's all about.

30:36.100 --> 30:38.100
Why are you fighting in it?

30:38.800 --> 30:40.100
It's personal.

30:40.200 --> 30:42.500
You want to prove
your manood to the world?

30:42.600 --> 30:46.400
The kumite is for the fighters,
not for the people who read newspapers.

30:47.100 --> 30:49.800
I've heard that it's unnecessarily brutal...

30:49.800 --> 30:52.800
...like a cockfight, except it's with people.

30:53.100 --> 30:55.200
You have the wrong picture.

30:55.600 --> 30:57.400
Well, you tell me about it then.

30:57.500 --> 30:59.800
I want to have the right picture.

31:00.200 --> 31:02.900
Okay, I'll talk to you, but one condition.

31:03.700 --> 31:05.000
What's that?

31:05.300 --> 31:08.300
You agree to have dinner with me
tomorrow night.

31:08.800 --> 31:12.000
Well, actually, I was hoping
Hossein would be free.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.300
That hurts me, just looking at it.

31:35.500 --> 31:36.900
Yo, Frankie!

31:37.100 --> 31:38.400
Earth to Frankie.

31:38.500 --> 31:41.000
This is ground control. Do you copy?

31:44.600 --> 31:46.400
It's time to get ready.

31:50.100 --> 31:51.600
You'd better stop doing that stuff.

31:51.700 --> 31:54.600
You might want to have kids
one of these days.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.500
Victor's downstairs.
Kumite Express leaves in five minutes.

32:09.500 --> 32:10.900
Are you ready?

32:17.500 --> 32:18.800
I am ready.

32:29.800 --> 32:32.700
You can almost smell the adrenaline
in this place, can't you?

32:32.800 --> 32:33.800
Yeah.

32:35.700 --> 32:38.000
They are gonna love me over here.

32:38.400 --> 32:41.600
You can really love Asians
because we're good-Iooking.

32:57.900 --> 33:00.100
Welcome, warriors of the world.

33:00.400 --> 33:03.400
Today you become part of a tradition...

33:03.800 --> 33:06.200
...that began hundreds of years ago.

33:07.100 --> 33:10.500
The kumite was first used
by the Kokuryukai...

33:10.800 --> 33:12.900
...the Black Dragon Society...

33:13.200 --> 33:16.500
...to measure the fighting skills and spirit...

33:16.700 --> 33:18.300
...of its members.

33:18.600 --> 33:22.200
Every five years,
the best fighters in its ranks...

33:23.400 --> 33:26.100
...would face each other in full-contact...

33:27.400 --> 33:32.300
...with one winner emerging
as the superior warrior...

33:32.400 --> 33:33.700
...the champion.

33:34.200 --> 33:36.100
The Kokuryukai has been joined...

33:36.200 --> 33:39.300
...by the International
Fighting Arts Association...

33:39.400 --> 33:42.000
...as co-sponsor for this event...

33:42.700 --> 33:47.000
...and as the guardians
of a rich and powerful heritage.

33:49.200 --> 33:50.500
After three days...

33:50.600 --> 33:54.200
...one fighter will prove himself
to be the best.

33:54.700 --> 33:57.000
May the mightiest warrior prevail!

34:31.500 --> 34:33.800
Now, remember, it's full-contact.

34:34.100 --> 34:37.500
There are three ways to win.
One, you knock the guy out.

34:37.800 --> 34:40.400
Two, your opponent quits
and shouts, "matte."

34:40.699 --> 34:42.600
It's like saying uncle.

34:42.600 --> 34:45.000
Three, you throw the fucker
right off the runway.

34:45.800 --> 34:47.300
Piece of cake.

34:48.199 --> 34:49.199
Haji!

34:54.000 --> 34:55.199
Hajime!

35:17.500 --> 35:19.900
That's why they call
this thing "bloodsport," kid.

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
Watch this, Frankie.
I'll show you how it's done, buddy.

36:19.400 --> 36:20.300
Haji!

36:20.400 --> 36:21.600
Asshole.

36:21.900 --> 36:23.000
Hajime!

36:43.000 --> 36:44.900
Come on, get up! Come on!

36:46.100 --> 36:48.100
I'm going to kill you, man!

36:51.000 --> 36:52.300
You got it!

36:58.400 --> 36:59.800
Frankie!

37:01.000 --> 37:02.900
Look at him, buddy. Yeah!

37:10.800 --> 37:11.900
You check that out?

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
- Good stuff, Jackson.
- Thanks.

37:16.600 --> 37:18.500
But what took you so long?

37:18.600 --> 37:20.200
Funny. Real funny.

37:23.600 --> 37:26.500
Chong Li! Chong Li! Chong Li!

37:26.600 --> 37:28.100
What's going on?

37:28.200 --> 37:29.700
That's Chong Li, the current champ.

37:29.800 --> 37:31.200
He's never been defeated.

37:31.300 --> 37:34.300
Holds all the records,
including the fastest KO.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.900
He killed a guy during the last kumite.

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
Yeah, kicked the poor bastard
right in the throat.

37:40.200 --> 37:42.400
Guy died right there on the platform.

37:42.600 --> 37:45.300
Chong Li stood there and watched him die.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.200
Junbi!

38:02.400 --> 38:03.400
Haji!

38:07.400 --> 38:08.600
Hajime!

38:27.100 --> 38:29.300
Chong Li! Chong Li! Chong Li!

39:03.400 --> 39:05.700
Now I show you some trick or two.

39:07.700 --> 39:08.800
Junbi!

39:15.300 --> 39:16.300
Haji!

39:18.600 --> 39:19.800
Hajime!

39:31.800 --> 39:33.500
Fastest I ever saw!

39:58.100 --> 40:01.900
His first fight in the kumite,
he broke the fucking world record!

40:02.000 --> 40:03.100
My buddy!

40:20.100 --> 40:21.200
Junbi!

40:26.900 --> 40:28.000
Haji!

40:31.000 --> 40:32.100
Hajime!

41:59.700 --> 42:00.900
Go home!

42:34.600 --> 42:36.200
This is real good stuff.

42:36.300 --> 42:37.800
How's your eel, as good as mine?

42:37.800 --> 42:39.800
I don't know, I haven't tasted it yet.

42:39.800 --> 42:42.100
You gotta tell them to kill it first.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.600
You should ask for forks.

42:44.700 --> 42:46.200
Inspector Chen.

42:46.400 --> 42:48.400
What a pleasant surprise. Please join us.

42:48.500 --> 42:50.000
No. I never eat here.

42:50.100 --> 42:52.100
I found some information for you.

42:52.200 --> 42:53.700
What is it, Inspector?

42:53.800 --> 42:56.400
Frank Dux is at the East Lake Hotel
in Kowloon.

42:57.200 --> 42:58.500
Thank you.

42:59.400 --> 43:01.400
Hey, have some eel.

43:13.600 --> 43:16.000
Okay, Dux, you know why we're here.

43:16.800 --> 43:19.300
We're taking you back, Frank. Let's go.

43:19.400 --> 43:21.200
Only when the kumite is over.

43:21.200 --> 43:23.400
Who the hell are these two scumbags?

43:23.400 --> 43:26.100
Just stay out of it, pal.
It's not your business, okay?

43:26.200 --> 43:28.300
I ain't your pal, dickface.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.400
Look, Frank...

43:32.600 --> 43:35.600
...the government has invested
a lot of time and money in you.

43:35.700 --> 43:37.600
Uncle Sam can't afford to let you get hurt.

43:37.600 --> 43:39.000
I won't get hurt.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.800
That's why we're here,
to make sure of that.

43:42.500 --> 43:44.400
Don't make it tough on us.

43:53.300 --> 43:55.600
I'll be in the airport in two days.

43:56.300 --> 43:58.200
That's not good enough.

43:58.300 --> 44:02.200
Frank, read my lips.
We are taking you back now.

44:04.300 --> 44:07.000
Don't make us use 50,000 volts on you.

44:11.100 --> 44:12.000
Excuse me.

44:12.800 --> 44:14.400
You want to shit sparks?

44:14.500 --> 44:16.200
You just stay put, okay?

44:16.600 --> 44:18.000
Stay put.

46:12.600 --> 46:14.800
All those different fighters in one event.

46:14.900 --> 46:17.800
- It sounds wild.
- You'd have to see it to believe it.

46:17.800 --> 46:19.600
Come on, Frank.

46:19.900 --> 46:21.400
Couldrt you just get me in?

46:21.500 --> 46:24.600
I really want this story.
It would mean so much to me.

46:25.100 --> 46:27.700
They have strict rules. No press.

46:27.800 --> 46:29.800
I bet we could think of something.

46:30.100 --> 46:31.800
I doubt it.

46:31.800 --> 46:34.000
You telling me you never break rules?

46:34.000 --> 46:35.200
What do you mean?

46:35.400 --> 46:37.200
Who are Helmer and Rawlins?

46:38.200 --> 46:40.500
Just friends. Why?

46:41.000 --> 46:43.100
They must be very close friends.

46:43.800 --> 46:46.500
They've been inquiring about you
all over Hong Kong.

46:47.800 --> 46:49.200
What do you want from me?

46:49.600 --> 46:52.000
I'd really like you to help me
get into the kumite.

46:54.500 --> 46:56.200
But more than that...

46:57.200 --> 46:59.700
...I'd really like to get to know you.

47:02.200 --> 47:04.500
After all, we have all night.

47:51.600 --> 47:53.000
I have to go.

47:53.800 --> 47:55.200
I know.

47:57.700 --> 47:59.100
Good luck today.

47:59.400 --> 48:00.600
Thanks.

48:02.800 --> 48:04.400
Meet me for dinner again tonight?

48:04.600 --> 48:05.600
Sure.

48:07.300 --> 48:09.900
About the kumite, I'm sorry.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.700
I cannot help you.

48:12.600 --> 48:14.000
It's okay.

48:14.500 --> 48:16.200
I'll get over it.

48:33.200 --> 48:34.600
See you.

49:03.200 --> 49:05.100
Where the hell have you been?

49:05.600 --> 49:08.400
You can't just disappear
in the middle of kumite like that!

49:08.500 --> 49:10.600
I got a rep to uphold, you know.

49:10.800 --> 49:13.300
You and Jackson don't tell me nothing.

49:13.400 --> 49:15.300
You guys are driving me crazy!

49:15.400 --> 49:17.000
Right now, hurry up and change.

49:17.300 --> 49:19.400
Pick a brick, any brick.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
I know. The bottom one, right?

49:32.800 --> 49:34.700
See? Not a scratch on it.

49:38.800 --> 49:40.500
Neither is this.

49:41.600 --> 49:43.200
For you.

49:46.000 --> 49:47.400
Yo, Frankie.

49:47.600 --> 49:49.400
I hope we don't bump heads.

49:49.600 --> 49:50.900
Come on, let's do it, buddy.

49:51.200 --> 49:52.500
Feel strong today?

49:52.800 --> 49:54.000
I feel fine.

49:54.200 --> 49:56.100
Good. You're a good fighter.

49:57.000 --> 49:58.500
- Good.
- Thanks.

50:07.800 --> 50:11.400
This isn't the first time
I've had to go undercover to get a story.

52:35.800 --> 52:37.700
Chong Li! Chong Li!

54:05.000 --> 54:06.300
Junbi!

54:09.400 --> 54:10.800
Haji!

54:28.900 --> 54:30.200
Hajime!

57:29.300 --> 57:31.200
All right, Frankie! Yeah!

57:36.100 --> 57:38.200
Dux! Dux!

57:45.600 --> 57:47.600
Time to separate the men from the boys.

57:47.700 --> 57:51.000
Just be careful Chong Li doesn't separate
your head from your body.

57:52.200 --> 57:54.200
Go for the gut. He's soft there.

57:54.300 --> 57:55.900
What are you talking about?

57:56.000 --> 57:57.800
Chong Li's weak in the gut.

57:57.900 --> 58:00.000
That's how Parades surprised him.

58:00.100 --> 58:01.400
You listening to me?

58:01.400 --> 58:04.900
Go for the stomach
and stay away from his right leg.

58:05.300 --> 58:08.100
Will you stop worrying, Frankie?
I've got it under control.

58:09.000 --> 58:11.400
You sound like my mother. Man alive.

58:16.500 --> 58:18.000
Junbi!

58:20.300 --> 58:21.900
Haji!

58:23.300 --> 58:24.600
Hajime!

58:33.500 --> 58:34.700
I got him!

58:34.900 --> 58:37.100
What are you doing? Keep going!

58:37.500 --> 58:39.000
Jackson! Jackson!

58:46.200 --> 58:47.400
I put him down!

58:47.500 --> 58:49.600
He's dead! I got him! Yeah!

59:08.600 --> 59:10.100
No! Stop!

59:24.000 --> 59:25.800
Chong Li! Chong Li!

59:36.700 --> 59:38.000
Come back, Frank!

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:18.800
Ray, I'm here.

01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:24.500
The doctor says you're going to be okay.

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:28.000
You are lucky you have a head like a rock.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.100
Yeah, you'll be out of here in a week.

01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:35.700
I'll get back at Chong Li.

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:37.900
That's a promise.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.800
You think that's what he wants,
someone to share a room with?

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:43.400
Janice, stay out of this.

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:45.900
Frank, I don't want to see you get hurt.

01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:47.500
Then don't watch.

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:49.500
If you want to argue, go elsewhere, please.

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:52.400
Sorry.

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:58.700
You're not even trying to understand
what this means to us, are you?

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:01.100
What's to understand about
a bunch of guys...

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:04.100
...who have to prove themselves
by beating each other up?

01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:07.000
- Why are you a reporter?
- What does that have to do with it?

01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:08.800
Just answer the question.

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:10.200
My father was a reporter.

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:12.800
I was a good writer.
It seemed the right thing to do.

01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:17.600
And you want to be the best reporter
you can be, for him and yourself, right?

01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:18.900
Yes, that's right.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.600
I'm just trying to be the best I can be.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.200
Not just for me,
for Tanaka, my Shidoshi, too.

01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:27.500
Great, Frank, that's just great!

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:28.800
Go right ahead!

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:31.600
I just hope you don't end up like Jackson,
or worse!

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:34.000
But I'm not going to stand around
and watch it.

01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:40.000
You're blowing it, Frank.

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.200
Forget about the girl.

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:44.700
Forget about getting back
at Chong Li for Ray.

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:47.600
You have a chance to take it all tomorrow.
Do you understand?

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:50.800
You can be the first Westerner
to win this thing.

01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:53.700
But you got to have a clear head.
You hear me?

01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:07.400
Why are you so interested
in stopping the kumite?

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:10.000
Someone almost got killed there today.

01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:14.200
I have a friend fighting in it.
I don't want him to get hurt.

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:25.900
Who is your friend?

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.500
His name is...

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:30.100
...Frank Dux.

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:00.400
You guys here for the finals?

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:04.400
There aren't going to be any finals, Dux,
at least not for you.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.500
Don't try to stop me.

01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:09.200
We're not. He will.

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:15.200
I didn't come this far to stop now.

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:17.600
You shouldn't have come in the first place.

01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:19.100
Take him.

01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:49.700
You're really being a hard-ass about this.

01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:50.800
Careful.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.400
- Put these on and I won't have to use it.
- It's your last warning.

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:03.200
Inspector, no. We've got to take him back.

01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:07.500
Just give us a break.
We've chased you all over Hong Kong.

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:10.200
- Can we stop this?
- Okay, Frank, you win.

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:12.800
But it's wrong what you're doing.
It's a mistake.

01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:17.700
I'll meet you at the airport tomorrow.

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:24.100
Now what?

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:26.500
How are we going to stop him?

01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:29.300
Follow me.

01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:36.600
Time's up. We can't wait any longer.

01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:39.800
Give me one more minute.
I give you my word. He'll be here.

01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:42.100
We must follow the rules.

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:43.800
Where's Mr. Dux?

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:47.000
I wish everyone would calm down.
I said, he'll be here.

01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:48.600
- Too late.
- Too late?

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.300
No such thing as too late.

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:55.600
Finally.

01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:00.800
- It's about fucking time!
- Sorry.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.600
How do you feel today, Dux?

01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:03.800
I feel good.

01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:05.200
I am ready.

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:06.700
Dux, my man!

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:50.300
Junbi!

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:54.000
Haji!

01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:57.400
Hajime!

01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:52.700
Come on!

01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:26.399
Well done.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.200
Junbi!

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.100
Haji!

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:57.900
Hajime!

01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:55.600
You are next.

01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:27.600
Prepare the platform for the final match.

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:30.400
This is it, Frank.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.600
You can make history here today.

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:48.900
You okay?

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:52.200
Yeah.

01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:56.000
Junbi!

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:02.200
Haji!

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.200
You break my record, now I break you.

01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:26.400
Like I break your friend.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.300
Hajime!

01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:11.400
Get him! Come on!

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:24.600
Get up!

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:00.600
Right on!

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:02.000
Come on!

01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:39.100
More!

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:33.200
Up!

01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:26.600
Get up, Frankie!

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.000
All right!

01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:16.800
Say it!

01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:25.300
Matte!

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:28.900
All right!

01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:54.300
Mr. Dux, you fought with inspiration.

01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:57.600
We of the Kokuryukai salute you.

01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:18.400
This is for you, Shidoshi.

01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:23.100
So you stomped him real good?

01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:24.700
Worse.

01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:27.400
What do you mean?

01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:30.000
He made him say matte.

01:22:31.900 --> 01:22:33.800
All right, Frankie!

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.600
Don't you get too cocky.

01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:39.100
Because you might have to
go up against me next time.

01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:40.800
I promise.

01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:43.800
You guys are out of your minds!

01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:46.400
I'll drink to that!

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.100
By the way, next time you fight...

01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:51.700
...try to keep your clothes on.

01:22:56.900 --> 01:23:00.700
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere...

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.000
...if you ever need me, I'll be there.

01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:09.000
I love you, my friend.

01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:15.000
Me, too.

01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:20.600
Take care.

01:23:33.900 --> 01:23:35.400
He's not going to show.

01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:38.200
Looks like he did it to us again, huh?

01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:41.700
Hey, guys!

01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:43.800
You coming or what?

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:47.400
You son of a bitch.

01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:49.700
You're always late!

01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:57.100
You're really a pain in the ass,
you know that?

01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:02.300
I'm just glad you're on our side, kid.
