00:50.467 --> 00:51.843
You played with Priest?

01:12.572 --> 01:13.865
Somebody do JB.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.403
Welcome to Indy, where you start
and it don't mean shit.

14:32.204 --> 14:34.707
If you're not playing, bro,
you still gotta go to stuff.

14:40.337 --> 14:42.965
"Oh, he a slapdick."
Or, "You shouldn't recruit him."

14:45.342 --> 14:47.344
You gotta still go to stuff, bro.

14:55.311 --> 14:58.606
That's Emmit, who they say,
he's the number one D tackle.

15:15.998 --> 15:18.834
Definitely looks like the back
that we're looking for.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.210
No shit, Coach.

17:00.686 --> 17:02.146
<i>BYU pulled they offer.</i>

17:02.229 --> 17:03.939
'Cause I can't even get in a game.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.149
I just got a D-II.

17:07.776 --> 17:09.486
Shit, I don't got shit.

18:56.593 --> 18:58.220
Just take him out of there.

20:48.747 --> 20:50.290
When Malik gets out here, be like,

20:50.374 --> 20:52.542
"Hey, Malik, kick rocks, dog.
I got this now."

22:11.079 --> 22:12.539
Brown running?

22:53.622 --> 22:54.998
Smoked too many cigars.

27:37.364 --> 27:38.698
How'd it break, again?

36:29.228 --> 36:31.522
Three weeks left,
you're just like, "Fuck it," huh?

36:40.990 --> 36:43.409
Look like you seen anybody
with your pads on out here?

43:38.115 --> 43:38.949
I'm straight.

44:28.248 --> 44:30.334
Rakeem's gotta tighten up, man.

50:12.009 --> 50:13.135
It's "trips right"?

53:05.974 --> 53:07.434
Gutsy call, but it wins games.
