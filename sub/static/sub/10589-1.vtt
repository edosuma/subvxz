WEBVTT

02:38.326 --> 02:41.695
A dollar for a homeless vet.
Come on, little man.

02:41.729 --> 02:45.266
Come on, little man. I fought
the war with your daddy.

02:45.299 --> 02:47.635
Y'all ain't paid me for this leg yet.
Thank you, sugar.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.603
Jackie chan! Jackie chan!

02:49.637 --> 02:52.840
Shanghai noon.

02:52.873 --> 02:56.677
I take traveler's checks. Arigato
to you too. Thank you, sugar.

03:02.350 --> 03:05.686
Here you go. Thanks.

03:29.643 --> 03:33.414
You kids!

03:43.991 --> 03:45.626
Here. Hold
it right there!

03:45.659 --> 03:47.328
What happened?

03:47.361 --> 03:48.662
Step away from her.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.698
Oh, man, he ain't done nothing.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.533
Those kids. Who took your bag?
This man?

03:52.566 --> 03:54.001
No, it was a couple of punks.

03:54.034 --> 03:55.903
They came and they just ran off.

03:55.936 --> 03:57.814
Four-eight, this is Romano.
Robbery and assault victim...

03:57.838 --> 03:59.873
With facial wound at
east 42nd entrance.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.009
Sir, I'd like you to
just stand right there.

04:02.042 --> 04:05.546
Certainly. Are you
traveling somewhere?

04:05.579 --> 04:08.582
I have arrived. My travels
are over for the time being.

04:08.616 --> 04:11.485
Where's your luggage?

04:11.519 --> 04:15.055
I don't require luggage.
Do you have a ticket?

04:15.088 --> 04:17.291
Train ticket? Ticket stub?

04:17.325 --> 04:19.927
I didn't arrive by train.

04:19.959 --> 04:22.763
Would you remove your
sunglasses for me, please?

04:22.796 --> 04:27.635
Oh, I'd rather not. I'd
forgotten, but I mean, wow,

04:27.668 --> 04:29.770
your planet is really bright.

04:29.803 --> 04:33.374
I see. East 42,
we have an e.D.P.

04:33.407 --> 04:35.376
I have to ask you to
come with us, sir.

04:35.409 --> 04:36.977
Of course.

04:58.832 --> 05:00.734
Freddy!

05:02.135 --> 05:05.072
Did you see this fella
come out of a gate?

05:05.105 --> 05:08.108
He didn't come from no gate.
Brother came from nowhere.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.478
You know what I'm saying?

05:10.511 --> 05:12.079
Yeah, Freddy, i know
what you're saying.

07:01.188 --> 07:04.858
I don't wanna go outside, because
there's things that can kill you...

07:09.797 --> 07:11.965
Thank you.

07:11.999 --> 07:14.101
If you breathe all those
chemicals out there,

07:14.134 --> 07:16.704
not to mention the cosmic
rays and the west nile virus,

07:16.737 --> 07:18.205
and that other one...

07:18.238 --> 07:20.808
The new airborne pigeon disease
nobody wants to talk about.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.810
The new pigeon disease.
I've heard of that.

07:22.843 --> 07:25.913
Another thing that's been
bothering me is the food.

07:25.946 --> 07:28.882
The cafeteria serves lukewarm
food, full of germs.

07:28.916 --> 07:31.151
You really need to do something
about that, Dr. Powell.

07:31.184 --> 07:33.521
Heat is the only thing
that kills germs. Heat.

07:33.554 --> 07:36.957
Point taken. We'll look
into that right away.

07:36.990 --> 07:41.495
In the meantime, i want you to start
taking your medication again.

07:41.529 --> 07:43.864
It'll help you sleep. And
you need the sleep, Ernie.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.899
Sleep is good.

07:48.035 --> 07:51.872
Is our time up?

07:51.905 --> 07:54.141
Only for today, Ernie.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.212
Two calls: Your wife, bring
home a bottle of wine.

07:59.246 --> 08:01.582
Yeah. And Dr. chakraborty.

08:01.615 --> 08:04.151
A transfer from bellevue he
wants you to take a look at.

08:04.184 --> 08:08.589
Great. Who is it this time?
Jesus Christ or Joan of arc?

08:08.622 --> 08:11.024
Dr. chakraborty didn't say.

08:37.918 --> 08:40.053
He arrived at
bellevue a month ago,

08:40.087 --> 08:42.756
suspicion of hallucinogenic
intoxication.

08:42.789 --> 08:45.993
But, uh, he was found negative
for substances of any kind.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.128
His EKG, his blood
value are all normal.

08:48.161 --> 08:50.764
There's no sign of
concussion, no brain tumor,

08:50.798 --> 08:54.167
no temporal lobe, epilepsy, no indication
of organic abnormality whatsoever.

08:54.201 --> 08:57.104
However, after one month,

08:57.137 --> 08:59.573
his amnesia and his
delusion have persisted.

09:00.941 --> 09:03.276
He claims to be not human.

09:03.310 --> 09:06.046
A visitor from another planet.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.916
They administered thorazine on
this guy for three weeks...

09:08.949 --> 09:12.886
At 300 milligrams a day,
and he was unresponsive?

09:12.920 --> 09:14.831
How can you be unresponsive to
300 milligrams of thorazine?

09:14.855 --> 09:16.123
It's impossible.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.058
That's why they sent him to you.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.928
Terrific.

09:20.961 --> 09:23.997
No I.D., no missing persons
report matching his description.

09:24.031 --> 09:26.634
What's this?

09:26.667 --> 09:29.236
He had it on him.

09:32.005 --> 09:35.075
Well, let's hope extraterrestrials
qualify for medicaid.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.679
He's here, doctor.

09:38.712 --> 09:41.348
Thank you, Joyce.

09:41.381 --> 09:46.219
Medical record 2-8-7.
Calls himself prot.

09:49.890 --> 09:52.192
This one's as gentle
as a pussycat, doc.

09:52.225 --> 09:54.995
Come in. Have a seat.

09:55.028 --> 09:58.932
"Have a seat."
Curious expression.

10:00.968 --> 10:03.704
Well, let me introduce myself.
I'm...

10:03.737 --> 10:06.173
Dr. mark Powell, chief of
clinical psychiatry...

10:06.206 --> 10:08.742
Of the Manhattan
psychiatric institute.

10:08.776 --> 10:11.211
Good. You know where you are.

10:13.046 --> 10:16.984
Well, now, uh... Prot, is it?

10:17.017 --> 10:20.387
"Prote." I see, "prote."

10:20.420 --> 10:23.156
Well, prot, we're
here to... may I?

10:24.692 --> 10:26.626
Please.

10:29.462 --> 10:32.232
Red delicious. You
call this variety.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.036
It's my favorite.

10:36.069 --> 10:39.406
I'd like to begin
by asking you...

10:39.439 --> 10:42.175
If you know why you're here.

10:42.209 --> 10:45.178
Of course. You think I'm crazy.

10:47.781 --> 10:52.152
We prefer the term "ill."
Do you think you are ill?

10:52.185 --> 10:54.421
A little homesick, perhaps.

10:54.454 --> 10:57.257
Really. Where is home?

10:57.290 --> 10:59.426
K-PAX.

10:59.459 --> 11:01.729
K-PAX?

11:01.762 --> 11:03.964
Capital "K," hyphen,
capitals "P-A-X."

11:03.997 --> 11:06.433
K-PAX is a planet.

11:06.466 --> 11:10.037
But don't worry, I'm not going
to leap out of your chest.

11:10.070 --> 11:13.173
I'm not worried.

11:13.206 --> 11:15.743
It's just that I'm only
familiar with nine planets.

11:15.776 --> 11:18.178
Well, actually, there are
ten, but that doesn't matter.

11:18.211 --> 11:20.380
I'm not from your solar system.

11:20.413 --> 11:23.851
K-PAX is about 1,000 of your
light-years away from here...

11:23.884 --> 11:26.453
In what you would call
your constellation lyra.

11:26.486 --> 11:28.822
That's quite a ways.

11:28.856 --> 11:30.724
I'm curious. How did
you get to earth?

11:33.961 --> 11:37.330
It's a matter of harnessing
the energy of light.

11:37.364 --> 11:40.133
I know that sounds crazy to you.

11:40.167 --> 11:42.970
You beings are eons away from
discovering light travel.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.340
You travel at the
speed of light?

11:47.374 --> 11:52.479
Oh, no. We can travel many times that
speed. Various multiples of "c."

11:52.512 --> 11:56.249
Otherwise, the trip here would have taken
about 1,000 years now, wouldn't it?

11:59.386 --> 12:02.322
What if, um, i were
to tell you...

12:02.355 --> 12:05.225
That according to a man who lived
on our planet named Einstein,

12:05.258 --> 12:10.430
that nothing can travel faster
than the speed of light?

12:10.463 --> 12:13.433
I would say that you misread Einstein, Dr.
Powell. May I call you mark?

12:13.466 --> 12:16.870
You see, mark, what
Einstein actually said...

12:16.904 --> 12:19.139
Was that nothing can accelerate
to the speed of light,

12:19.172 --> 12:21.174
because its mass would
become infinite.

12:21.208 --> 12:23.243
Einstein said nothing
about entities

12:23.276 --> 12:25.345
already traveling at the
speed of light or faster,

12:25.378 --> 12:28.782
- at tachyon speeds.
- Tachyon?

12:28.816 --> 12:32.385
I detect a note of skepticism, Dr.
Powell.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.955
Oh, not at all. It's
just that you...

12:34.988 --> 12:37.290
You speak English so well.

12:37.324 --> 12:40.460
I'm amazed. Well, English isn't
that difficult a language to learn.

12:40.493 --> 12:46.066
You should try speaking...

12:49.369 --> 12:52.372
I'm... I'm confused.

12:52.405 --> 12:55.042
Maybe you can explain it to me.
Uh...

12:55.075 --> 12:58.178
How is it that being a
visitor from space,

12:58.211 --> 13:00.881
that you-you look
so much like me...

13:00.914 --> 13:03.183
Or anyone else from earth?

13:07.254 --> 13:10.157
Why is a soap bubble round?

13:10.190 --> 13:13.060
Why is a soap bubble round?

13:13.093 --> 13:16.196
You know, for an educated person,
mark, you repeat things quite a bit.

13:16.229 --> 13:18.465
Are you aware of that?

13:20.500 --> 13:23.136
A soap bubble is round...

13:23.170 --> 13:26.539
Because it is the most
energy-efficient configuration.

13:28.141 --> 13:31.845
Similarly, on your
planet, i look like you.

13:31.879 --> 13:34.047
On K-PAX, i look
like a K-PAXian.

13:34.081 --> 13:37.017
Prot,

13:37.050 --> 13:39.252
why did you want to
come to our planet?

13:40.921 --> 13:43.857
Well, I've been here
many times before.

13:43.891 --> 13:47.194
But what brought me here first?
I don't know.

13:47.227 --> 13:50.030
Pure curiosity, I guess.

13:50.063 --> 13:53.066
I'd never been to a class
ba-3 planet before.

13:53.100 --> 13:55.235
Class ba-3?

13:55.268 --> 13:57.204
Early stage of evolution.

13:57.237 --> 14:00.640
Future uncertain.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.643
And if I give all my
possessions to feed the poor...

14:03.676 --> 14:07.614
Howie.
Go on. Talk to him.

14:07.647 --> 14:10.884
Go on.

14:10.918 --> 14:13.853
You're really from... Up there?

14:15.155 --> 14:17.157
Indeed.

14:18.658 --> 14:21.128
I am from K-PAX.

14:21.161 --> 14:23.997
What...

14:24.031 --> 14:27.234
What sort of place is it?

14:27.267 --> 14:29.536
K-PAX is bigger
than your planet.

14:29.569 --> 14:34.574
But we are circled by
seven purple moons.

14:34.607 --> 14:37.377
Bullshit, bullshit,
bullshit, bullshit,

14:37.410 --> 14:40.047
bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.548
Go on.

14:45.485 --> 14:49.957
Well, K-PAX is most lovely when
k-mon and k-ril are in conjunction.

14:49.990 --> 14:54.294
Those are our two suns. What you
would call agape and satori.

15:24.457 --> 15:26.159
You finish your homework, Abby?

15:26.193 --> 15:28.228
Yeah.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.697
I lost another tooth.

15:30.730 --> 15:34.534
Oh, yeah? Let me see. Hey! Maybe the
tooth fairy will come tonight. Huh?

15:34.567 --> 15:36.436
There's no such thing as
the tooth fairy, dad.

15:36.469 --> 15:39.339
There's just you and mom.

15:39.372 --> 15:43.343
I fed them already. I couldn't wait.
How was your day?

15:43.376 --> 15:47.680
Oh, 6:15 was late. Didn't
leave the station till 6:30.

15:47.714 --> 15:49.582
Should have caught the
nearest beam of light.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.684
You should have caught what?

15:51.718 --> 15:54.587
Oh, nothing. How was your day?
Good.

15:54.621 --> 15:58.658
Sent the deposit in for the house on the
cape for the last two weeks of August.

15:58.691 --> 16:01.304
Which works out perfectly, 'cause Abby
doesn't get out of camp till the 15th.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.330
Sent the deposit in?

16:03.363 --> 16:05.498
Yeah. Come on, rache.

16:05.532 --> 16:09.069
That wasn't definite. We were just talking.
I said maybe.

16:09.102 --> 16:11.638
Maybe sometime in
August we'll clear it.

16:11.671 --> 16:15.008
Maybe. Maybe we should start paying you
for your time. You got a family rate?

16:15.042 --> 16:18.378
Oh, look. They
published my letter.

16:20.113 --> 16:21.714
I spoke with Natalie

16:21.748 --> 16:23.759
about going into the
after-school program next year,

16:23.783 --> 16:26.386
in case i go back to teaching.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.488
And this morning
my head fell off,

16:28.521 --> 16:30.499
but I was able to sew it
back on with dental floss.

16:30.523 --> 16:34.361
Waxed, of course. Dental floss?

16:34.394 --> 16:36.429
Sorry. I wasn't listening.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.331
Yeah, I know. Let's just eat.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.070
Train was late.
I'm tired.

16:43.103 --> 16:45.372
And to top it off, the city
is dumping patients on us.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.707
I know.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.249
You stink.

16:58.385 --> 17:01.254
Have a nice day, sal.

17:01.288 --> 17:04.191
I've been to 64
planets within our galaxy.

17:04.223 --> 17:06.259
Earth is the only one
with your species,

17:06.292 --> 17:08.560
homo sapiens, that
I've visited so far.

17:08.595 --> 17:10.530
And
when did you arrive on earth?

17:10.563 --> 17:12.598
Four years and nine months ago.

17:12.632 --> 17:14.567
So that makes you how old?

17:14.601 --> 17:17.537
In earth terms, 337 years old.

17:17.569 --> 17:19.539
I aged about seven getting here,

17:19.571 --> 17:22.142
traveling at six
multiples of "c."

17:22.175 --> 17:25.278
But really, Marko, it only
seemed like an instant.

17:25.311 --> 17:29.716
Marko? Time may
warp at super light speed.

17:29.749 --> 17:33.086
I'd say access one
psychosis nos.

17:33.120 --> 17:35.422
That's glib to call
him a psychotic.

17:35.455 --> 17:37.557
That's a wastebasket diagnosis.

17:37.590 --> 17:40.560
Oh, yeah? He believes he traveled
here from another planet.

17:40.593 --> 17:42.762
What's your diagnosis, jet lag?

17:42.795 --> 17:45.432
Well, how come he didn't
respond to the haldol?

17:45.465 --> 17:47.200
Haldol can
make you more psychotic.

17:47.234 --> 17:49.769
It's rare, but it does happen.

17:49.802 --> 17:54.274
Look. I'm not saying that medication
can't be a useful tool...

17:54.307 --> 17:56.776
To help somebody like
this, but you can't...

17:56.809 --> 18:00.680
He may be a good subject for the "betazine"
protocol. The drug's on clinical trial.

18:00.713 --> 18:03.383
You want to experiment on him
before we have a diagnosis?

18:03.416 --> 18:05.852
Do you have some other idea?

18:05.885 --> 18:09.789
He's not a danger to anyone. How
about getting to know him first?

18:09.822 --> 18:13.560
In the meantime, we have ten
new transfers to take care of.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.629
You know, maybe
what's wrong with him...

18:16.663 --> 18:19.732
Is that he is. Is what?

18:19.766 --> 18:22.202
From the planet K-PAX.

18:59.306 --> 19:01.140
Mmm.

19:05.878 --> 19:08.381
Your produce alone has
been worth the trip.

19:13.786 --> 19:17.290
Could you tell me...

19:17.324 --> 19:20.293
A bit about your
boyhood on K-PAX?

19:20.327 --> 19:21.861
Where were you born?

19:23.396 --> 19:27.334
You were, uh, born, right?

19:27.367 --> 19:29.536
K-PAXians have babies?

19:29.569 --> 19:32.272
Oh, yes, much like on earth,
but unlike you humans,

19:32.305 --> 19:35.942
the reproductive process is
quite unpleasant for us.

19:35.975 --> 19:38.454
Could you compare the effect to
something that I might understand?

19:38.478 --> 19:41.381
Like a toothache? It's more like
having your nuts in a vise,

19:41.414 --> 19:42.849
except we feel it all over.

19:42.882 --> 19:46.219
And to make matters worse, the
sensation is associated...

19:46.253 --> 19:49.589
With something like your nausea,
accompanied by a very bad smell.

19:49.622 --> 19:52.892
The moment of climax is like
being kicked in the stomach,

19:52.925 --> 19:55.595
and then falling into a
pool of mod droppings.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.897
Mod droppings?

19:57.930 --> 20:02.469
A mod is a being, much like your
skunk, only far more potent.

20:04.837 --> 20:08.608
Uh, if it's such a
terrible experience,

20:08.641 --> 20:12.845
uh, how do you reproduce?

20:12.879 --> 20:15.582
As carefully as possible.

20:15.615 --> 20:17.984
What are you doing?

20:18.017 --> 20:21.821
Well, you just reminded me of something
I want to include in my report.

20:21.854 --> 20:24.324
Your report. Yes,
it's our custom...

20:24.357 --> 20:26.735
To compile descriptions of the various
places and people we encounter...

20:26.759 --> 20:28.661
Throughout the galaxy.

20:33.566 --> 20:36.603
Morning, Betty.
Good morning, prot.

20:36.636 --> 20:38.738
Morning, navarro.
Hey, what's up, man?

20:38.771 --> 20:41.408
Mr. Friedman. Morning, Maria.

20:41.441 --> 20:45.612
- I'm Vanessa.
- Just chill.

20:47.447 --> 20:50.483
Morning, Bess.

20:50.517 --> 20:55.655
She doesn't talk to anybody. Afraid smoke
will come out of her mouth when she talks.

20:55.688 --> 20:58.391
Been here since she was a little girl.
Burned her house down.

20:58.425 --> 21:01.528
Shouldn't play with matches.
Very dangerous.

21:01.561 --> 21:05.865
It was an electrical fire. Why do
you make up stories like that?

21:05.898 --> 21:08.000
Ernie has a very
powerful imagination.

21:11.371 --> 21:14.006
Philistine!

21:14.040 --> 21:18.945
Come on, Doris. You gotta come
out of your room sometime.

21:18.978 --> 21:22.782
Look what I brought
just for you.

21:22.815 --> 21:25.518
Pooh, pooh, pooh,
pooh, pooh, pooh, pooh, pooh.

21:25.552 --> 21:27.554
Do that again,
you go up to three.

21:29.656 --> 21:33.660
Her royal highness never, ever comes
out of her room. Not even for eating.

21:33.693 --> 21:35.338
No wonder she's here. I'm
sick and tired of this shit.

21:35.362 --> 21:38.565
Every day, coming up here and
shooting food at me. I hate this.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.942
The service here is atrocious!

21:51.411 --> 21:55.515
Good morning, Mrs.
Archer. Doris.

21:58.017 --> 22:01.421
I wasn't expecting any
gentleman callers...

22:01.454 --> 22:03.556
Until this afternoon.

22:03.590 --> 22:05.592
Excuse me.

22:19.472 --> 22:21.107
You have a place set for two.

22:23.910 --> 22:28.948
Oh, yes. Um... I'm
expecting someone.

22:28.981 --> 22:30.750
How long have you been waiting?

22:30.783 --> 22:32.985
Eleven years.

22:35.888 --> 22:40.126
For some around here might...

22:40.159 --> 22:43.596
Call that crazy, but I
prefer to call it...

22:43.630 --> 22:46.132
Romantic.

22:46.165 --> 22:49.068
Romantic. Like a, uh...

22:50.437 --> 22:53.005
Waltz in the moonlight, or a...

22:53.039 --> 22:55.975
Candlelit dinner...

22:56.008 --> 22:58.545
Or a sunset. Oh, we have those.

22:58.578 --> 23:01.514
On K-PAX, we have two suns.

23:01.548 --> 23:05.518
They rise together only
once every 200 years.

23:05.552 --> 23:07.153
And that is quite a sight.

23:10.957 --> 23:13.893
He most definitely has a
sensitivity to white light,

23:13.926 --> 23:17.697
but I think it's his range
that you'll find interesting.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.966
What am I looking at?

23:19.999 --> 23:23.703
He can detect light at a wavelength
of up to 300 to 400 angstroms.

23:24.804 --> 23:27.440
Ultraviolet.

23:27.474 --> 23:30.643
Of course, prot's
explanation is that...

23:30.677 --> 23:34.914
Due to his planet's peculiar quality
of light caused by its two suns,

23:34.947 --> 23:40.520
K-PAXians are used to light conditions
much like our twilight most of the time.

23:40.553 --> 23:42.555
W-wait a minute. Chuck,
I didn't think...

23:42.589 --> 23:44.457
Human beings could see
ultraviolet light.

23:44.491 --> 23:46.092
We can't.

24:03.876 --> 24:05.978
Good morning, Joyce.

24:06.012 --> 24:09.015
That's a lovely configuration
you're wearing today. Thank you.

24:10.883 --> 24:12.752
Macy's. Come in.

24:24.797 --> 24:26.899
This is so much better.

24:28.701 --> 24:30.469
It's a lot like home.

24:43.916 --> 24:46.786
Well, uh, prot,

24:46.819 --> 24:49.255
I was hoping you'd tell
me more about home.

24:52.058 --> 24:53.826
Well, what would
you like to know?

24:55.027 --> 24:57.997
Well, uh, do you, um,

24:59.298 --> 25:03.002
do you have a family on K-PAX?

25:03.035 --> 25:06.005
It doesn't work on K-PAX the
same way it works here, mark.

25:06.038 --> 25:09.275
On K-PAX, we don't have families
in the way that you think of them.

25:09.308 --> 25:13.245
In fact, a family would be a non sequitur
on our planet, as it would on most others.

25:14.781 --> 25:17.149
In other words, um,

25:17.183 --> 25:22.021
you, uh, you never
knew your parents.

25:22.054 --> 25:25.157
On K-PAX, children are not
raised by their biological

25:25.191 --> 25:26.525
parents, mark, but by everyone.

25:26.559 --> 25:29.762
They circulate among us, learning
from one and then another.

25:29.796 --> 25:32.264
Do you have a child? No.

25:34.601 --> 25:37.036
Do you have a wife waiting
back for you on K-PAX?

25:37.069 --> 25:39.038
Mark. Mark. Mark.

25:42.008 --> 25:45.111
You are not really listening to
what I'm saying to you, are you?

25:47.647 --> 25:49.315
We do not have
marriage on K-PAX.

25:49.348 --> 25:51.884
There are no wives.
There are no husbands.

25:51.918 --> 25:54.553
There are no families.

25:58.057 --> 26:02.061
I see. So, um,

26:02.094 --> 26:06.232
what about...
Societal structure?

26:06.265 --> 26:08.768
Government. No, there's
no need for one.

26:08.801 --> 26:12.972
- You have no laws?
- No laws. No lawyers.

26:13.005 --> 26:15.708
How do you know
right from wrong?

26:15.742 --> 26:19.245
Every being in the universe
knows right from wrong, mark.

26:22.381 --> 26:25.685
But what if...

26:25.718 --> 26:29.055
If someone did do
something wrong...

26:29.088 --> 26:33.192
Committed murder or rape...

26:33.225 --> 26:35.194
How would you punish them?

26:38.798 --> 26:41.167
Let me tell you something, mark.

26:41.200 --> 26:44.236
You humans, most of you,

26:44.270 --> 26:46.839
subscribe to this policy
of "an eye for an eye...

26:46.873 --> 26:49.251
A life for a life," which is
known throughout the universe...

26:49.275 --> 26:51.644
For its stupidity.

26:51.678 --> 26:53.989
Even your Buddha and your Christ
had quite a different vision,

26:54.013 --> 26:55.682
but nobody's paid much
attention to them,

26:55.715 --> 26:57.383
not even the Buddhists
or the christians.

26:59.285 --> 27:03.189
You humans,

27:03.222 --> 27:06.225
sometimes it's hard to imagine
how you've made it this far.

27:17.403 --> 27:21.841
Josh, be careful.

27:21.874 --> 27:23.634
Okay, kids. Let's go.
The hot dogs are ready.

27:27.446 --> 27:30.149
Hey. Where were you just now?

27:32.051 --> 27:33.953
Come on. Okay.

27:35.287 --> 27:39.258
Hey, kids, come on. Wash up.

27:39.291 --> 27:40.993
Okay!

27:42.729 --> 27:46.165
Josh. Now come on,
quit teasing the dog.

27:46.198 --> 27:48.300
Josh, let's go. Settle down now.

27:48.334 --> 27:52.071
- Here we are.
- Oh, park that right here.

27:53.873 --> 27:55.517
Boy, that looks terrific.
That looks great.

27:55.541 --> 28:00.012
Steve, how was, uh, how was
your trip up from Princeton?

28:00.046 --> 28:03.449
Not too bad. We even
stopped by to see Michael.

28:03.482 --> 28:05.952
Oh, that was nice of you, sis.

28:05.985 --> 28:08.020
Quite a detour for you guys.

28:08.054 --> 28:10.156
Well, it was his birthday.

28:10.189 --> 28:13.025
I know it was his birthday.

28:13.059 --> 28:15.928
I sent him a card
and a nice, uh,

28:15.962 --> 28:18.164
a nice, big check as usual.

28:18.197 --> 28:20.933
It wouldn't kill you to pick up the
phone every once in a while...

28:20.967 --> 28:23.069
And talk to your own son.

28:23.102 --> 28:26.705
Thank you, Abby. You wanna
pass the potato salad, please?

28:27.874 --> 28:30.076
There you go.

28:30.109 --> 28:33.880
By the way, I put him through dartmouth.
He knows how to pick up a phone too.

28:33.913 --> 28:36.983
I'm thinking of inviting him
for Christmas. Oh, great.

28:37.016 --> 28:41.087
He spends Christmas
with his mother.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.966
He won't come here. How do you know?
When was the last time you asked him?

28:43.990 --> 28:46.358
Am I on the couch here, or what?

28:46.392 --> 28:49.128
You want a beer?
Please and thank you.

28:49.161 --> 28:50.963
You want some more? Can
I have corn, darling?

28:56.135 --> 28:59.038
Steve, I, uh,

28:59.071 --> 29:01.808
I have a rather unusual
favor to ask you.

29:01.841 --> 29:04.310
What can I do you for, Dr. "p"?
Well, I have a patient.

29:04.343 --> 29:07.146
Sit down. I have this
patient, who, uh,

29:07.179 --> 29:09.215
seems to know quite a
bit about your field.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.383
A patient who's an astronomer?

29:11.417 --> 29:14.453
So, tell me about this
patient of yours.

29:14.486 --> 29:19.491
Well, he, uh, he claims to come
from a planet he calls K-PAX.

29:19.525 --> 29:22.128
What kind of name is that?
K-PAX?

29:22.161 --> 29:27.533
He says it's a thousand light-years
away, near the constellation lyra.

29:27.566 --> 29:31.170
Uh-huh. Big head? Green?
About this high?

29:31.203 --> 29:33.272
Yeah, I think i know the guy.

29:33.305 --> 29:36.042
No, he's, uh, he's
very convincing.

29:40.179 --> 29:44.016
I mean, of course,
he's, uh, he's human.

29:44.050 --> 29:46.218
It's just that he's, um,

29:46.252 --> 29:50.456
well, he's-he's the most convincing
delusional I've ever come across.

29:50.489 --> 29:54.961
If I can prove to him that this K-PAX
is just a figment of his imagination,

29:54.994 --> 29:58.297
then maybe I can find
out who he really is.

29:58.330 --> 30:01.300
Well, sure. I can give you...

30:01.333 --> 30:03.493
A whole list of questions to
ask your fella. Wonderful.

30:06.072 --> 30:08.574
All his books and
papers and everything...

30:08.607 --> 30:13.445
Are spread all over the desk like
always, but he's just sitting there.

30:13.479 --> 30:15.447
Someone change his medication?

30:15.481 --> 30:19.218
I gave him his usual,
anafronil, 250 milligrams.

30:24.223 --> 30:27.326
Hmm. Well,
something's wrong with him.

30:27.359 --> 30:31.830
An obsessive-compulsive doesn't just
sit there looking out the window.

30:40.239 --> 30:42.241
Howie?

30:47.346 --> 30:50.082
Good morning, Dr. Powell.

30:50.116 --> 30:54.086
Good morning. But are you
looking for something?

30:54.120 --> 30:56.122
Bluebird.

30:56.155 --> 30:58.290
The bluebird?

30:58.324 --> 31:00.259
The bluebird of happiness.

31:02.995 --> 31:05.932
Prot told me to find the
bluebird of happiness.

31:05.965 --> 31:08.600
Prot told you.

31:08.634 --> 31:10.536
It's a task.

31:10.569 --> 31:12.404
The first of three.

31:14.540 --> 31:17.309
I don't know what the
other two are yet.

31:17.343 --> 31:20.246
He'll tell me.

31:20.279 --> 31:24.250
If I complete all three,

31:24.283 --> 31:26.218
I'll be cured.

31:38.397 --> 31:41.333
There. Maintain
your breathing.

31:41.367 --> 31:44.203
That's it. Now you see?

31:44.236 --> 31:46.581
There are none of these ammonia
particles that you're so worried about.

31:46.605 --> 31:49.641
In the first place, i would be able
to see them. Good morning, sal.

31:49.675 --> 31:51.410
And I don't. Good morning, Dr.
Stinky.

31:51.443 --> 31:53.912
Ringed monkey, 7:00.

31:58.550 --> 32:01.020
Take a bath. Take a bath.

32:01.053 --> 32:04.356
Ernie, could you excuse us for
a moment, please? Mm-hmm.

32:04.390 --> 32:06.292
Good to, uh, see you
outside, Ernie.

32:06.325 --> 32:09.595
Thank you. Oh, Ernie, you stink.

32:09.628 --> 32:13.265
Prot, it's one thing to take an
interest in your fellow patients.

32:13.299 --> 32:16.068
It's quite another to make them
think that you can cure them.

32:16.102 --> 32:18.170
You seem overly upset, mark.

32:18.204 --> 32:22.074
To borrow a phrase from
navarro, you need to chill.

32:22.108 --> 32:25.711
For your information, all beings have
the capacity to cure themselves, mark.

32:25.744 --> 32:28.023
This is something we've known
on K-PAX for millions of years.

32:28.047 --> 32:32.351
Listen to me. On this planet,
I'm a doctor, you're a patient.

32:32.384 --> 32:36.022
Doctor. Patient. Curious
human distinction.

32:36.055 --> 32:39.191
It's not your job to cure Howie.

32:39.225 --> 32:42.128
Or Ernie or Maria or anyone else.
It's mine.

32:42.161 --> 32:43.996
Then why haven't you
cured them yet?

32:46.398 --> 32:50.636
Oh, by the way, here are the answers
to the questions you asked me.

32:53.639 --> 32:55.507
I hope they meet
your satisfaction.

33:10.556 --> 33:12.558
I don't know what to say, mark.

33:12.591 --> 33:16.195
I mean, this is... this
is pretty wild stuff.

33:16.228 --> 33:20.232
Gibberish, huh?
Well, not exactly.

33:20.266 --> 33:22.634
I mean, see,

33:22.668 --> 33:25.771
your patient indicates
his planet, K-PAX,

33:25.804 --> 33:29.708
orbiting an eclipsing binary
star system... agape and satori.

33:29.741 --> 33:32.544
Yeah. Near the
constellation lyra.

33:32.578 --> 33:34.546
He could have looked
that up, right?

33:35.814 --> 33:39.118
That's the funny thing, mark.
Not really.

33:39.151 --> 33:43.122
I mean, except for my
boss, Duncan Flynn,

33:43.155 --> 33:46.125
one of the foremost
astrophysicists in the world...

33:46.158 --> 33:50.662
And maybe two or three
of his colleagues,

33:50.696 --> 33:53.799
nobody knows much about the possibility
of planets in this star system yet.

33:53.832 --> 33:56.034
It hasn't even been
reported in any journals.

33:57.303 --> 34:00.206
Tell me, honestly,

34:00.239 --> 34:02.308
did Duncan put you up to this?

34:02.341 --> 34:05.144
You know... you
know, like a joke?

34:05.177 --> 34:08.714
No.
It's no joke, Steve.

34:08.746 --> 34:11.150
Uh, tell me,

34:11.183 --> 34:14.686
do you know of any
missing astrophysicists?

34:14.719 --> 34:18.524
Can't say I do.

34:18.556 --> 34:21.760
But there's one or two around here who'd
sure like to meet this fella of yours.

34:21.793 --> 34:24.295
Thanks a lot, Steve. I
sure appreciate it.

34:27.166 --> 34:31.303
♪ B, a, d, c, b, c, d

34:31.337 --> 34:33.472
But unlike you
humans, the reproductive process...

34:33.505 --> 34:35.217
- Is an unpleasant one for us.
- Start again.

34:35.241 --> 34:38.877
♪ What way is it unpleasant?

34:38.909 --> 34:40.879
It's a pain...

34:43.215 --> 34:45.351
♪

34:50.755 --> 34:54.760
Good. Not too fast.
Okay.

35:02.501 --> 35:04.370
♪

37:04.723 --> 37:06.758
So, this is your
neighborhood, huh?

37:16.368 --> 37:19.471
Hello, gentlemen. Sure
appreciate you meeting with us.

37:19.505 --> 37:22.384
Thank you, Dr. Powell. We'd like to get to
the bottom of this just as much as you.

37:22.408 --> 37:26.478
Thank you, doctor. Great. Let
me introduce you to prot.

37:28.780 --> 37:31.583
It's a pleasure to meet you, prot.
I'm Dr. Becker.

37:31.617 --> 37:34.386
This is Dr. Flynn.

37:34.420 --> 37:36.655
Drs. Patel and hessler.

37:38.690 --> 37:42.861
Doctor. Doctor. Doctor. Doctor.

37:44.463 --> 37:46.598
How many doctors are
there on this planet?

38:03.815 --> 38:07.553
Here, prot. Have a seat.

38:07.586 --> 38:10.556
"Have a seat." Oh, shit!

38:12.691 --> 38:14.860
Feel at home?

38:20.432 --> 38:22.634
We found your notes quite
interesting, prot,

38:22.668 --> 38:25.604
and we'd like to ask you some
questions, if that's all right.

38:25.637 --> 38:28.607
Be my guest. Good. Then
I'll jump right in.

38:28.640 --> 38:31.009
Make sure you can swim.

38:31.042 --> 38:33.745
Yes, well,

38:33.779 --> 38:36.882
let's start with this idea
of light travel, shall we?

38:38.384 --> 38:39.985
What can you tell us about that?

38:42.988 --> 38:44.956
Absolutely nothing.

38:44.990 --> 38:47.493
If I told you, you'd
blow yourselves up.

38:47.526 --> 38:49.528
Or worse, someone else.

38:49.561 --> 38:52.531
You'd be surprised how much
energy is in a beam of light.

38:52.564 --> 38:55.967
Hmm. Well, then,

38:56.001 --> 39:00.105
maybe you could show us how
this light travel works.

39:03.409 --> 39:05.411
You mean a demonstration.

39:05.444 --> 39:07.813
That would be... fine.

39:19.525 --> 39:21.359
Adios. Aloha.

39:25.497 --> 39:28.567
Well, when are you gonna...
I'm already back.

39:32.771 --> 39:36.174
See, where I come from, prot, that's called
"the fastest gun in the west" routine.

39:36.207 --> 39:39.645
Well, I don't come from where
you come from, Dr. Becker.

39:42.448 --> 39:45.917
Prot, you've indicated in your
notes that your planet K-PAX...

39:45.951 --> 39:49.588
Orbits around the twin stars of agape and
satori, near the constellation lyra.

39:49.621 --> 39:51.490
Well, frankly, we're
a bit mystified...

39:51.523 --> 39:53.425
As to how you gained knowledge

39:53.459 --> 39:55.727
there's such a planetary
system around these stars.

39:55.761 --> 39:58.129
Professor, where I come from,
that's common knowledge.

40:00.766 --> 40:03.669
This was taken from the hubble.

40:06.004 --> 40:08.907
We've computer enhanced it, based on Dr.
Patel's readings...

40:08.940 --> 40:11.510
From telescopes in
Chile and Hawaii.

40:11.543 --> 40:15.747
It's the clearest picture we
have of where you come from.

40:18.550 --> 40:22.688
What we'd like is if you could
diagram on the light pad...

40:22.721 --> 40:25.991
The orbital pattern that your
planet takes through this system.

40:31.697 --> 40:33.999
Mm-hmm. My pleasure.

41:31.657 --> 41:34.259
I think that's right.

41:36.895 --> 41:38.897
Steven, could you input that?

41:38.930 --> 41:40.498
Already on it.

41:44.035 --> 41:46.137
Wh-what's going on?

42:15.100 --> 42:17.168
I take it my calculations

42:17.202 --> 42:19.046
help explain the "protabations"
you've been seeing...

42:19.070 --> 42:22.140
In the rotation pattern
of your binary star,

42:22.173 --> 42:27.078
but have been unable to explain until...
This moment.

42:36.755 --> 42:38.857
How...

42:38.890 --> 42:40.859
How could you know this?

42:42.360 --> 42:44.963
How could you...

42:44.996 --> 42:47.098
Every K-PAXian knows this.

42:48.834 --> 42:51.069
Just as every child
on earth knows...

42:51.102 --> 42:54.305
That your planet revolves
around your sun.

42:54.339 --> 42:56.842
It's common knowledge. Isn't it?

43:14.025 --> 43:17.863
What, um, what
happened in there?

43:17.896 --> 43:19.898
I mean, you...

43:20.999 --> 43:23.234
He could be a savant.

43:23.268 --> 43:26.972
There-there are savants who have
painted flawless copies of Rembrandt,

43:27.005 --> 43:30.375
who couldn't... who couldn't
remember their own names.

43:31.977 --> 43:35.013
You don't believe him, Steve.

43:38.784 --> 43:42.120
I don't know what I believe,
mark, but I know what I saw.

43:50.896 --> 43:54.265
I moved. I moved.
It's your move.

43:54.299 --> 43:57.268
One and two.
Your move.

44:03.975 --> 44:05.977
Bluebird.

44:09.147 --> 44:11.382
Bluebird.

44:11.416 --> 44:13.184
You just wait till next game.
Bluebird.

44:15.220 --> 44:18.690
Bluebird! Bluebird!

44:20.058 --> 44:23.461
Bluebird! Bluebird! Bluebird!

44:23.494 --> 44:26.798
Howie! Bluebird! Bluebird!

44:26.832 --> 44:30.435
Bluebird! Bluebird! Bluebird!

44:30.468 --> 44:33.204
Howie. Bluebird. Bluebird.
Bluebird.

44:33.238 --> 44:36.007
Okay. Okay. Bluebird!

44:36.041 --> 44:38.109
Where's the bluebird?

44:38.143 --> 44:40.912
Look, bluebird! Bluebird!
Bluebird!

44:40.946 --> 44:42.948
Oh, my god.

44:46.952 --> 44:50.288
Bluebird! Bluebird! Howie!
Howie, get back here!

44:50.321 --> 44:54.059
Bluebird! Bluebird! Bluebird!

44:54.092 --> 44:56.261
Do bluebirds bite, sal?

44:56.294 --> 44:58.897
Nah, they don't bite, stinkhead.

45:02.500 --> 45:05.804
Hey, Bess, it's a bluebird.

45:08.774 --> 45:11.142
- Shit!
- Disturbance on two.

45:14.045 --> 45:18.116
- It's the bluebird!
- Bluebird! Bluebird!

45:18.149 --> 45:20.051
Bluebird!
Bluebird!

45:30.929 --> 45:32.463
Bluebird! Bluebird!

45:37.135 --> 45:39.838
It's mass hysteria.

45:39.871 --> 45:44.042
Betty! Betty, what the
hell is going on here?

45:44.075 --> 45:47.846
- Come here! Come here!
- Dr. Powell, come and see!

45:47.879 --> 45:52.350
You see it?
Do you see it?

45:52.383 --> 45:55.420
Look it! Look it! Look it!

45:55.453 --> 45:59.457
What's going on here, Dr. Powell?
What on earth is out there?

45:59.490 --> 46:02.994
- Just a blue Jay.
- A blue Jay?

46:07.598 --> 46:10.135
A blue Jay.

46:11.870 --> 46:14.072
Off the chair.
Everybody, get off the chairs.

46:14.105 --> 46:18.076
Mrs. Archer...
Come out of her room.

46:23.114 --> 46:25.116
Bluebird?

46:29.454 --> 46:31.222
It's a bluebird?

46:33.058 --> 46:35.026
Come on over here.

47:17.035 --> 47:20.071
I know who you are.

47:22.974 --> 47:25.510
You're the bluebird.

47:31.082 --> 47:33.518
Good night, Bess.

47:39.657 --> 47:42.493
And how are we today?
Oh, just fine.

47:42.527 --> 47:45.396
That's good, Maria. My man.

47:53.271 --> 47:54.572
Psst.

48:07.152 --> 48:09.487
Excuse me. Mm-hmm.

48:16.327 --> 48:20.298
About that light travel thing.

48:20.331 --> 48:23.301
I was wondering if maybe you
could show me how to do that.

48:28.673 --> 48:33.111
I put up with the stink in
this place for ten years.

48:33.144 --> 48:35.947
I wanna get out, if
you know what I mean.

48:37.382 --> 48:41.019
I used the be the
doorman at the Plaza.

48:41.052 --> 48:43.288
F-fifteen years.

48:43.321 --> 48:45.390
That's when I started
to notice it.

48:46.591 --> 48:50.161
Notice what? The smell.

48:50.195 --> 48:52.597
They all stank.

48:52.630 --> 48:57.168
I-i tried to tell 'em, but, uh,

48:57.202 --> 48:59.437
they put me here.

48:59.470 --> 49:01.973
And, um, and-and...

49:03.708 --> 49:08.146
And this-this place
smells worse than all.

49:08.179 --> 49:10.681
Except for you.
Y-you don't smell,

49:10.715 --> 49:13.684
so I figured maybe
you could help me.

49:16.487 --> 49:20.458
You should smell the York
blossoms on my planet...

49:20.491 --> 49:23.061
In a gentle breeze.

49:23.094 --> 49:26.464
Pretty much like
your sugarplums.

49:26.497 --> 49:29.367
I would... I would
like to smell that.

49:31.602 --> 49:35.706
I would like to go
there, to-to your, um,

49:35.740 --> 49:38.243
planet.

49:38.276 --> 49:41.479
I'm afraid I can only take one
person back with me when I go.

49:45.550 --> 49:49.620
Uh, I had my weekly
session with sal today.

49:49.654 --> 49:51.656
He says you're
taking him to K-PAX.

49:51.689 --> 49:54.692
In fact, I've heard from most
of the patients on ward two,

49:54.725 --> 49:57.328
they all tell me that
they're going to K-PAX.

49:57.362 --> 49:59.097
I wonder if that's a wise thing

49:59.130 --> 50:01.232
to be promising patients
in a psychiatric facility.

50:01.266 --> 50:04.102
No, no, no, mark. I made it clear
to each and every one of them,

50:04.135 --> 50:06.737
I can only take one person
back with me when I return.

50:06.771 --> 50:09.674
Return? Mark, don't
get me wrong.

50:09.707 --> 50:12.710
I mean, you've been
very hospitable.

50:12.743 --> 50:16.481
Hospital. Hospitable.

50:16.514 --> 50:20.218
But my time here is almost up, and
I can't wait to get back. Back?

50:20.251 --> 50:22.387
To K-PAX? Yes, of course.
Where else?

50:22.420 --> 50:24.655
You're planning to
return to K-PAX.

50:24.689 --> 50:27.792
You're repeating yourself again, mark.
Yes, I have one trip to take up north,

50:27.825 --> 50:30.395
and then I am planning
on returning to K-PAX.

50:30.428 --> 50:33.431
Joyce gave me these strawberries this
morning from her garden in hoboken.

50:33.464 --> 50:36.534
They're delicious. You'll
have to forgive me, but, um,

50:36.567 --> 50:39.137
but this is a bit confusing.

50:39.170 --> 50:41.806
- When are you planning on...
- I'm departing on July 27.

50:41.839 --> 50:46.177
Why? Why, uh, why July 27?

50:46.211 --> 50:48.546
Safety reasons.

50:48.579 --> 50:51.092
You see, I can go anywhere on earth
without fear of bumping into someone...

50:51.116 --> 50:53.451
Traveling at super light speed,

50:53.484 --> 50:55.429
but beings are coming and going
all the time from K-PAX.

50:55.453 --> 50:57.588
It has to be coordinated.

50:59.590 --> 51:01.726
You're telling me...

51:01.759 --> 51:05.630
You're beaming back
to K-PAX on July 27.

51:05.663 --> 51:08.566
At 5:51 A.M., eastern time.

51:29.187 --> 51:31.822
Hey, hey, hey, honey.

51:31.856 --> 51:34.625
Mark, you were just dreaming.

51:34.659 --> 51:36.827
You were just dreaming.

51:42.267 --> 51:44.302
Daddy? Mark.

51:44.335 --> 51:46.371
Mark, what's going on?
Daddy's okay.

51:46.404 --> 51:48.239
Go back to bed, honey.
Where is daddy going?

51:48.273 --> 51:50.351
Daddy's all right. He has a tummyache.
He's all right.

51:50.375 --> 51:52.510
Daddy! Get in bed!

51:52.543 --> 51:54.545
And
when did you arrive on earth?

51:54.579 --> 51:55.446
Four years and nine months ago.

51:55.480 --> 51:56.714
What's going on?

51:56.747 --> 52:00.318
Shh! Listen.

52:00.351 --> 52:02.620
And when did you
arrive on earth?

52:02.653 --> 52:04.622
Four years and nine months ago.

52:04.655 --> 52:06.424
Your years.

52:08.593 --> 52:11.729
Four years, nine months
and three days ago.

52:11.762 --> 52:15.600
That'll be five years to the date on
July 27. That's when he's leaving.

52:15.633 --> 52:18.736
What? To go back to K-PAX.

52:18.769 --> 52:21.239
Mark, what is the
matter with you?

52:21.272 --> 52:23.374
Rachel... mark, it is
2:00 in the morning.

52:23.408 --> 52:25.210
What is... what is this
patient doing to you?

52:25.243 --> 52:27.778
He's telling me that five
years ago on July 27...

52:27.812 --> 52:30.248
Something terrible
happened to him.

52:30.281 --> 52:34.452
Some horrible trauma. I gotta
get to him before that date.

52:34.485 --> 52:37.522
- Mom, what's happening?
- Unbelievable.

52:37.555 --> 52:39.595
Nothing. Come on. Come on.
Let's all go back to bed.

52:40.891 --> 52:44.195
Ah, I've got it!

52:44.229 --> 52:45.763
Come on. Let's eat.

52:48.833 --> 52:52.337
- Is the spaceman here yet?
- Shh. Don't call him that.

52:52.370 --> 52:54.839
Spaceman.
Spaceman. No, no. No, no.

52:54.872 --> 52:57.808
Whoo! Everybody, come here.

52:57.842 --> 53:00.211
Listen, everybody, look. He's
going to be here any minute.

53:00.245 --> 53:03.681
I want you guys to just calm down.
Be yourselves. Act natural.

53:03.714 --> 53:06.551
Okay. Spaceman.

53:06.584 --> 53:09.954
Why, is he going
to zap us with his laser gun?

53:09.987 --> 53:12.823
I mean it. I do. Here.

53:12.857 --> 53:14.959
Oh, mom.

53:14.992 --> 53:17.262
I can't believe i
agreed to this.

53:17.295 --> 53:19.297
I tried everything else.
Rachel, look.

53:19.330 --> 53:21.832
I want him to spend
fourth of July with us...

53:21.866 --> 53:24.411
To see if a normal family environment
might bring something out of him.

53:24.435 --> 53:26.437
Since when did we
become a normal family?

53:26.471 --> 53:29.707
Please. Look. They're here.

53:29.740 --> 53:32.477
I just feel uncomfortable.
Well, don't.

53:32.510 --> 53:34.912
Joyce's son, he's on the
high school wrestling team,

53:34.945 --> 53:36.814
and Betty's husband's an ex-cop.

53:36.847 --> 53:39.884
Hey! Hi.

53:39.917 --> 53:42.587
Hey, Joyce. Hey, buddy.

53:42.620 --> 53:45.623
Glad you could make it.

53:45.656 --> 53:48.459
Wow. This is my
husband, Dominic.

53:48.493 --> 53:50.928
He looks like data. That's
right, embarrass him.

53:50.961 --> 53:53.331
Welcome, prot.

53:53.364 --> 53:55.766
This is my wife Rachel.

53:59.704 --> 54:03.508
How do you do? Rachel.

54:03.541 --> 54:06.010
Thank you so much for
inviting me today.

54:06.043 --> 54:07.712
Thanks for coming.

54:09.847 --> 54:12.617
- Watch out. Watch out.
- No.

54:12.650 --> 54:17.355
Shasta, no. Shasta, no.
Shasta!

54:17.388 --> 54:20.558
Come here, good dog. I know.
I know.

54:20.591 --> 54:23.461
Damn dog's never liked anyone.
Shh.

54:23.494 --> 54:26.931
Oh. Okay. Kids.

54:26.964 --> 54:31.035
Girls. Girls.
Come here.

54:42.012 --> 54:44.549
Okay.

54:44.582 --> 54:47.618
She says she doesn't like it when
you hide her favorite tennis shoe.

54:47.652 --> 54:50.355
And she doesn't hear so well in
her left side, so...

54:50.388 --> 54:52.056
So don't sneak up
on her anymore.

54:52.089 --> 54:55.660
No way.

55:00.365 --> 55:02.600
Let's get some lunch, okay?
Let's have lunch.

55:08.706 --> 55:10.675
Let's go eat.

55:22.119 --> 55:23.888
It's good, Rachel.

55:23.921 --> 55:25.890
Okay, you guys, come on.

55:25.923 --> 55:27.725
Careful, careful, Gabby.

55:32.062 --> 55:34.031
All right. Come on.
Somebody else want some?

55:34.064 --> 55:36.033
There we go.

55:38.603 --> 55:41.572
So, prot, mark tells
me you don't eat meat.

55:41.606 --> 55:43.674
That's very healthy. Speak for yourself.

55:43.708 --> 55:45.576
Burger. Burger.

55:45.610 --> 55:47.745
You got it?

55:47.778 --> 55:50.481
Yes, I want burgers, thank you.
It's good.

55:50.515 --> 55:52.116
Everything looks so good.

55:52.149 --> 55:53.618
Pass me one of those hamburgers.

55:56.020 --> 55:58.556
Come on.

56:14.605 --> 56:16.541
Give me a push.

57:56.106 --> 58:00.277
There's a photograph on the piano
of a young man with all the others.

58:00.310 --> 58:02.713
That's Michael.

58:02.747 --> 58:05.149
That's mark's son from
his first marriage.

58:06.283 --> 58:08.519
How many marriages has he had?

58:08.553 --> 58:12.156
Just the two... So far.

58:14.191 --> 58:16.193
"So far"? No, I mean,

58:16.226 --> 58:18.262
he's not out to set a
world record or anything.

58:20.631 --> 58:22.900
But the young man in the
photograph, he's not here today.

58:25.736 --> 58:27.872
No, um, he doesn't live with us.

58:27.905 --> 58:30.274
You know, he's away
at college and...

58:30.307 --> 58:34.511
And the truth is, he and mark
don't talk to each other.

58:36.981 --> 58:39.249
I don't know why I'm telling you this.

58:39.283 --> 58:42.319
Probably because I'm a locked-up
lunatic, so what harm could it do.

58:42.352 --> 58:45.656
Maybe.

58:47.357 --> 58:49.293
Maybe that's it.

58:52.830 --> 58:56.100
Dr. Powell's been trying to
teach me the importance...

58:56.133 --> 58:59.604
You beings place on your
biological connections. Hmm.

59:00.938 --> 59:02.707
You think he means it?

59:05.009 --> 59:06.811
You don't?

59:11.816 --> 59:13.618
Do you know what a family is?

59:15.019 --> 59:18.288
You worry.

59:18.322 --> 59:21.626
They don't tell you that, you know.

59:25.730 --> 59:27.598
You don't have a family.

59:30.267 --> 59:32.302
No.

59:36.240 --> 59:38.242
We don't have families on K-PAX.

59:41.278 --> 59:44.949
Well, you don't know what you're missing.

59:51.021 --> 59:52.757
I'll get you some more lemonade.

59:59.229 --> 01:00:02.833
♪ Hula, hula all right.
Incoming.

01:00:02.867 --> 01:00:06.303
That's beautiful. Thank you.

01:00:06.336 --> 01:00:09.674
Fourth of July.

01:00:09.707 --> 01:00:12.710
Thank you for inviting
me here today, mark.

01:00:12.743 --> 01:00:14.712
You're most welcome, prot.

01:00:17.047 --> 01:00:19.016
Come push me on the swing!

01:00:21.151 --> 01:00:23.153
I'll show you a trick.

01:00:23.187 --> 01:00:25.355
This is called...

01:00:25.389 --> 01:00:27.024
Go to the table and have a beer.

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:32.963
Okay.

01:00:32.997 --> 01:00:34.932
But first you have to
hold on very tight.

01:00:34.965 --> 01:00:36.934
Okay. Ready?

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:45.309
This is fun!

01:00:53.117 --> 01:00:55.019
Come on, let's go! Come on!
Come on!

01:00:55.052 --> 01:00:56.921
Watch out. Watch out.

01:01:09.333 --> 01:01:11.836
Let's go in the water!

01:01:11.869 --> 01:01:14.004
No, don't. Come on!

01:01:14.038 --> 01:01:17.407
No, don't go. Don't go.
Let's go!

01:01:17.441 --> 01:01:20.177
Hey! Let go! Don't go in the water!
Don't! No, don't!

01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:22.246
Mom! No! No, you stay! No!

01:01:22.279 --> 01:01:24.314
Natalie? Natalie!

01:01:24.348 --> 01:01:27.284
Mark! Mark!

01:01:27.317 --> 01:01:30.354
Prot!

01:01:30.387 --> 01:01:33.223
Hey, this guy's as strong as an ox!
Betty, quick!

01:01:33.257 --> 01:01:37.094
Turn off the goddamn water!

01:01:37.127 --> 01:01:40.097
Stay there, Josh. I'll turn it off!
I got it.

01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:42.767
It's okay.

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:46.070
Prot?

01:01:46.103 --> 01:01:50.507
It's okay. It's okay. No, no, no, it's
okay, Betty. Where are his glasses?

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:52.910
I got it. Are you all right?

01:01:52.943 --> 01:01:55.980
Prot?

01:01:59.516 --> 01:02:01.451
You're okay.

01:02:05.255 --> 01:02:07.024
Is that apple pie I smell?

01:02:17.001 --> 01:02:20.004
Sweetheart, you all right? Yeah.

01:02:20.037 --> 01:02:23.808
He was pushing my daughter on a swing,
like he had done a hundred times before.

01:02:23.841 --> 01:02:26.510
Not like he was some
alien from K-PAX.

01:02:28.145 --> 01:02:31.816
I saw him. He was
connecting with something.

01:02:31.849 --> 01:02:34.118
Some kind of normal life.
That's not enough.

01:02:34.151 --> 01:02:36.086
He's a violent patient, mark.

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:38.422
He's not violent.

01:02:38.455 --> 01:02:41.992
Something violent happened to him.
Something in his past.

01:02:42.026 --> 01:02:43.870
When he was going after Natalie,
he wasn't trying to harm her,

01:02:43.894 --> 01:02:45.529
he was trying to protect her.

01:02:45.562 --> 01:02:50.067
From the sprinklers? I'm
not sure from what.

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:53.503
I need more than a hunch to go on,
otherwise i have to send him upstairs.

01:02:53.537 --> 01:02:57.274
We need to regress him...
Take him back into the past,

01:02:57.307 --> 01:03:00.077
find out what happened and
have him confront it.

01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:02.813
Regress him? Do you have
any idea how risky it is

01:03:02.847 --> 01:03:04.348
to regress a patient
like this one?

01:03:04.381 --> 01:03:07.184
It's his only chance.

01:03:07.217 --> 01:03:10.020
Claudia, we have to push him.
There's no time.

01:03:10.054 --> 01:03:12.456
He told me that he's going
back to K-PAX on July 27.

01:03:12.489 --> 01:03:15.292
That's in three weeks.

01:03:15.325 --> 01:03:19.930
I think that he could become violent on
that day. Hurt himself, somebody else.

01:03:19.964 --> 01:03:22.332
You know what the
problem is, mark.

01:03:22.366 --> 01:03:24.168
You're too close
to this patient.

01:03:24.201 --> 01:03:27.171
Everybody else can
see it but you.

01:03:27.204 --> 01:03:30.074
I am transferring him to the
fourth floor, and that's final.

01:03:30.107 --> 01:03:33.143
I know I'm too close to him.
All right, fine. I admit it.

01:03:33.177 --> 01:03:35.045
Why choose this one
to save, mark?

01:03:35.079 --> 01:03:39.850
I don't know. Maybe...
Maybe because I feel...

01:03:39.884 --> 01:03:41.818
He chose me.

01:03:48.425 --> 01:03:50.227
Has anyone seen prot?

01:03:52.296 --> 01:03:54.999
He went up north for a few days.

01:03:55.032 --> 01:03:58.602
"North"? Greenland.

01:03:58.635 --> 01:04:00.570
Iceland.

01:04:00.604 --> 01:04:03.540
You know.

01:04:03.573 --> 01:04:07.244
He had a few countries left to visit
before he could finish his report.

01:04:07.277 --> 01:04:10.147
Don't worry, Dr. Powell.
He'll be back.

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:13.083
How do you know, Ernie?

01:04:13.117 --> 01:04:15.319
Because he took his glasses
with him, darling.

01:04:15.352 --> 01:04:17.854
When he returns to K-PAX,
he won't need them.

01:04:27.998 --> 01:04:30.634
Patients do not escape from this
institution. They don't escape.

01:04:30.667 --> 01:04:32.970
There has been no
evidence of escape,

01:04:33.003 --> 01:04:36.173
but obviously, I've notified
the police, social services.

01:04:36.206 --> 01:04:39.309
I'm gonna have a great time
explaining this to the state board.

01:04:39.343 --> 01:04:41.654
I got psychotics on the fourth
floor packing up their sneakers...

01:04:41.678 --> 01:04:43.489
Because they all think
they're going off to K-PAX.

01:04:43.513 --> 01:04:45.282
Claudia... find him.

01:04:52.156 --> 01:04:55.025
Well, what about city shelters?

01:04:55.059 --> 01:04:57.661
Have you... have you checked?

01:04:59.563 --> 01:05:01.966
No.

01:05:01.999 --> 01:05:05.369
No, I'm not telling you
how to do your job.

01:05:05.402 --> 01:05:08.072
Uh... thank... thank you.

01:05:58.422 --> 01:06:00.991
Dr. Powell, i presume.

01:06:01.025 --> 01:06:03.393
Where the hell have you been?

01:06:03.427 --> 01:06:07.197
Newfoundland, Greenland,
Iceland, uh, labrador...

01:06:07.231 --> 01:06:10.567
All right, cut the crap. We've been
looking for you for three days.

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:14.471
I believe I mentioned my taking a trip
up north, mark, in this very garden.

01:06:14.504 --> 01:06:16.606
"Taking a trip"?
You're a patient here.

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:20.077
You don't leave here without a discharge.
And don't give me this beam-of-light shit,

01:06:20.110 --> 01:06:22.379
because I don't buy it.

01:06:24.514 --> 01:06:26.550
What would you say if
I were to tell you...

01:06:26.583 --> 01:06:29.019
That I don't believe you
took any trip at all...

01:06:29.053 --> 01:06:31.055
To Iceland or Greenland
or anywhere?

01:06:31.088 --> 01:06:35.125
That I don't believe
you're from K-PAX?

01:06:35.159 --> 01:06:38.062
I believe you're
as human as I am.

01:06:38.095 --> 01:06:40.397
I would say you're in need
of a thorazine drip, doctor.

01:06:45.402 --> 01:06:49.106
Well, there... there
is one way...

01:06:49.139 --> 01:06:51.608
You could convince
me beyond any doubt.

01:06:51.641 --> 01:06:54.111
Of course, i would
need your consent.

01:06:54.144 --> 01:06:56.413
It's called hypnosis.

01:06:56.446 --> 01:07:00.250
I just don't see the point. Let me
tell you what your alternative is.

01:07:00.284 --> 01:07:03.520
A trip to a place where they'll stick
a needle in your ass every morning,

01:07:03.553 --> 01:07:05.531
which may or may not leave you
with a stupid grin on your face...

01:07:05.555 --> 01:07:07.524
For the rest of your
days here on earth.

01:07:07.557 --> 01:07:10.360
Is that what you'd like?

01:07:10.394 --> 01:07:12.729
Prot?

01:07:12.762 --> 01:07:14.698
I want to help you.

01:07:17.267 --> 01:07:22.572
What we're going to be doing,
prot, is a bit like daydreaming.

01:07:22.606 --> 01:07:25.675
I'm gonna count
from one to five.

01:07:25.709 --> 01:07:29.379
On the count of three,
your eyes will close,

01:07:29.413 --> 01:07:31.381
and you will find yourself
in a very nice, deep,

01:07:31.415 --> 01:07:34.118
comfortable, relaxed
state of hypnosis.

01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:41.191
One. Your eyes are starting
to get very heavy now.

01:07:42.592 --> 01:07:45.295
Two. I want you to use
your imagination...

01:07:45.329 --> 01:07:49.433
And imagine small lead
weights on your eyelids...

01:07:49.466 --> 01:07:54.338
That are just making them so...
heavy.

01:07:54.371 --> 01:07:56.440
Pulse
rate is 40 b.P.M. Three.

01:07:56.473 --> 01:07:58.418
Keep your eyes closed. I'd be
concerned if he were human.

01:07:58.442 --> 01:08:03.380
Let yourself go
way, way down deep.

01:08:03.413 --> 01:08:08.318
Four. Let a wave of relaxation
move through your body now...

01:08:08.352 --> 01:08:11.155
As you go down even deeper.

01:08:11.188 --> 01:08:13.323
And five,

01:08:13.357 --> 01:08:18.528
going way, way down deep.

01:08:18.562 --> 01:08:21.765
You are in a relaxed
state of hypnosis now.

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:24.768
How do you feel?

01:08:26.770 --> 01:08:29.538
Like...

01:08:29.573 --> 01:08:31.375
Nothing.

01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:35.245
I want you to go back in time.

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:42.152
I want you to recall the first
experience that you can remember.

01:08:42.185 --> 01:08:43.886
What do you see?

01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:48.457
What was that?

01:08:49.893 --> 01:08:51.795
What do you see?

01:08:56.566 --> 01:08:58.402
Uh...

01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:02.606
I see...

01:09:02.639 --> 01:09:04.474
Casket.

01:09:06.443 --> 01:09:08.278
Silver...

01:09:09.912 --> 01:09:11.814
With a blue lining.

01:09:13.617 --> 01:09:15.551
Whose casket is it?

01:09:18.421 --> 01:09:21.358
It's the father of
a friend of mine.

01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:23.627
What's your friend's name?

01:09:25.595 --> 01:09:27.331
I'm not telling.

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:32.935
Do you know how your
friend's father died?

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:38.675
He had an accident at the
place that he worked at.

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:41.745
He was killed in an accident?

01:09:41.778 --> 01:09:45.982
He... he was hurt and
then died later?

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:49.353
Where did he work? The place
where they kill cows.

01:09:49.386 --> 01:09:51.287
Where is this place?

01:09:54.858 --> 01:09:57.627
The pulse rate just shot up ten b.P.M.S.

01:09:57.661 --> 01:10:02.198
Do you know... do you know
where this place is?

01:10:07.471 --> 01:10:09.506
I-i want you to relax.

01:10:10.874 --> 01:10:13.610
I want to move
forward in time now.

01:10:16.713 --> 01:10:18.682
Where are you?

01:10:20.016 --> 01:10:22.852
It's nighttime.

01:10:22.886 --> 01:10:24.954
We're in his house.

01:10:24.988 --> 01:10:28.425
At the other boy's house? Yeah.

01:10:28.458 --> 01:10:29.993
I want him to come outside.

01:10:30.026 --> 01:10:32.362
Why?

01:10:36.366 --> 01:10:38.502
To look at the stars.

01:10:40.304 --> 01:10:42.606
That's where I come
from, you know.

01:10:44.841 --> 01:10:46.610
Is your name prot?

01:10:49.513 --> 01:10:51.381
Wow.

01:10:51.415 --> 01:10:53.750
How did you know that?

01:10:53.783 --> 01:10:56.019
Where are you from, prot?

01:10:58.021 --> 01:11:00.457
I'm from the planet K-PAX.

01:11:00.490 --> 01:11:02.826
It's in the constellation lyra.

01:11:02.859 --> 01:11:05.629
Do you know all the
constellations?

01:11:05.662 --> 01:11:08.832
Yeah. Most of 'em.

01:11:08.865 --> 01:11:12.769
And does your friend know them too?
Yes, he does.

01:11:12.802 --> 01:11:15.872
When his dad got sick and had to
stay home, they got a telescope,

01:11:15.905 --> 01:11:19.543
and his dad taught him about
all the constellations.

01:11:21.678 --> 01:11:24.948
But he's not interested
in those right now.

01:11:24.981 --> 01:11:27.517
Why not?

01:11:27.551 --> 01:11:30.487
Something happened.

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:33.590
That's why he called me.

01:11:33.623 --> 01:11:36.426
He calls me when
something bad happens.

01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:38.328
Like when his father died?

01:11:40.096 --> 01:11:42.065
That's right.

01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:47.437
How do you know to come?
How does the boy call you?

01:11:47.471 --> 01:11:51.408
I don't know. I just come.
I just... I just know.

01:11:51.441 --> 01:11:53.577
How do you get to earth?

01:11:53.610 --> 01:11:57.013
I wanna go outside.
Can I go outside?

01:11:57.046 --> 01:11:59.082
Uh, read... read his
body language, mark.

01:11:59.115 --> 01:12:01.718
I-i don't think he wants
to talk anymore today.

01:12:01.751 --> 01:12:03.820
All right. Prot?

01:12:03.853 --> 01:12:06.656
I want you to just relax now.

01:12:06.690 --> 01:12:08.992
Think about the stars.

01:12:10.994 --> 01:12:15.031
That's right. I'm gonna count
backwards now from five to one,

01:12:15.064 --> 01:12:18.668
and you'll find yourself
wide-awake and refreshed.

01:12:18.702 --> 01:12:22.439
Five. You're starting
to come out of it now.

01:12:22.472 --> 01:12:24.674
Four. You're feeling more alert.

01:12:24.708 --> 01:12:26.876
Three. Even more alert.

01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:29.446
Two. You're becoming awake now.

01:12:29.479 --> 01:12:31.448
And one.

01:12:36.019 --> 01:12:37.954
So when do we begin?

01:12:37.987 --> 01:12:39.756
It's already over.

01:12:43.893 --> 01:12:47.397
Oh, the old "fastest gun
in the west" routine, huh?

01:12:53.903 --> 01:12:56.473
Let's find the locations
of all the slaughterhouses

01:12:56.506 --> 01:12:58.908
operating in the United States.

01:12:58.942 --> 01:13:02.145
I mean, how many can there be?

01:13:02.178 --> 01:13:04.714
I don't know.

01:13:04.748 --> 01:13:08.485
We eliminate, uh, the ones
in or near big cities...

01:13:08.518 --> 01:13:12.856
And we concentrate on
small towns, rural areas,

01:13:12.889 --> 01:13:16.693
you know, places where
you can see the stars.

01:13:18.462 --> 01:13:21.164
Joyce, we only have six days.

01:13:25.034 --> 01:13:27.637
Shall I bring the crystal
or leave it here?

01:13:27.671 --> 01:13:30.607
I suppose I won't really
need it on K-PAX.

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:33.910
I don't even know what they drink.

01:13:33.943 --> 01:13:37.113
Dream on, sister. He can only
take one of us with him.

01:13:37.146 --> 01:13:39.916
Why the hell would he take a
stinker like you? He's taking me.

01:13:39.949 --> 01:13:43.520
How dare you! I do not stink.

01:13:43.553 --> 01:13:45.822
Nah, forget it, ho.
I'm the one goin'.

01:13:45.855 --> 01:13:48.191
Yeah? Which one of you?

01:13:48.224 --> 01:13:52.195
Okay. Who would like to begin?

01:13:52.228 --> 01:13:56.733
Ernie. Uh, i-i was... I was
wondering if it was possible...

01:13:56.766 --> 01:13:58.802
For us to have cream of wheat instead
of oatmeal.

01:13:58.835 --> 01:14:01.905
Not again. Howie.

01:14:01.938 --> 01:14:05.074
I have a suggestion, because there's
really, really not much time.

01:14:05.108 --> 01:14:08.244
I would like to propose
an essay contest...

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:12.482
To decide once and for all
who will go with prot.

01:14:12.516 --> 01:14:17.754
I've spoken with him, and he's
agreed to read them all by July 27.

01:14:17.787 --> 01:14:19.956
So if anyone would
like to be considered,

01:14:19.989 --> 01:14:23.059
please state your reasons
in a clear, legible hand...

01:14:23.092 --> 01:14:26.095
And return them to me.

01:14:26.129 --> 01:14:29.633
Russell.

01:14:29.666 --> 01:14:31.768
Yes?

01:14:34.170 --> 01:14:37.907
Would I get to take
my Bible to K-PAX?

01:14:37.941 --> 01:14:40.544
Of course you would.

01:14:40.577 --> 01:14:42.879
We can finish the essays later.

01:14:51.154 --> 01:14:53.790
Now, I want you
to go back in time again,

01:14:53.823 --> 01:14:55.759
but not so far
back as last time.

01:14:58.662 --> 01:15:01.631
Is your friend there?

01:15:01.665 --> 01:15:04.300
Is he with you now?

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:07.737
Yeah.

01:15:07.771 --> 01:15:10.273
What's his name?
I'm not tellin'.

01:15:11.875 --> 01:15:14.310
Prot, I would like to
know your friend's name.

01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:16.780
Well, I ain't gonna tell ya.

01:15:20.283 --> 01:15:23.687
Well, we have to
call him something.

01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:25.855
How about Pete?

01:15:25.889 --> 01:15:28.792
Well, that's not his name,
but whatever thrills you.

01:15:29.959 --> 01:15:34.330
What year is it? It's 1985.

01:15:34.363 --> 01:15:37.901
How old are you? One
hundred and seventy-five.

01:15:37.934 --> 01:15:39.803
How old is Pete? Seventeen.

01:15:40.770 --> 01:15:42.906
Tell me about Pete.

01:15:45.074 --> 01:15:47.176
What happened?

01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:50.113
Is there a problem?

01:15:50.146 --> 01:15:52.916
Is that why he called you?

01:15:52.949 --> 01:15:56.319
He's got a girlfriend.

01:15:56.352 --> 01:15:59.155
And the problem is with the girlfriend?
She's pregnant.

01:15:59.188 --> 01:16:01.333
He can see it all coming right
down the road. You get married,

01:16:01.357 --> 01:16:05.662
have a bunch of kids, wind up in
the same job that killed your dad.

01:16:05.695 --> 01:16:07.897
He blames her for this?
Oh, no, no, no.

01:16:07.931 --> 01:16:11.234
He doesn't blame her.
No, he just...

01:16:11.267 --> 01:16:14.237
He... how did he put it?

01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:17.306
He hates the chains that people
shackle themselves with.

01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:19.709
I mean, we don't have
all that crap on K-PAX.

01:16:19.743 --> 01:16:23.346
All right, prot. I want you
to listen to me carefully.

01:16:24.981 --> 01:16:27.250
I want to move forward
in time again.

01:16:28.317 --> 01:16:30.253
Oh, say, two weeks.

01:16:32.021 --> 01:16:35.258
You...

01:16:35.291 --> 01:16:38.061
If you would like to open your
eyes or move around, you may.

01:16:39.663 --> 01:16:41.665
Would you like to? I know that.

01:16:47.070 --> 01:16:48.905
Prot?

01:16:52.241 --> 01:16:54.978
Prot, when... it's, uh,

01:16:55.011 --> 01:16:57.714
1991,

01:16:57.747 --> 01:17:00.850
according to your
earth calendar.

01:17:00.884 --> 01:17:03.186
And your friend Pete called you?

01:17:03.219 --> 01:17:05.321
Not for anything in particular.

01:17:05.354 --> 01:17:09.292
He just... sometimes wants
to talk things over...

01:17:10.426 --> 01:17:13.863
With someone every now and then.

01:17:13.897 --> 01:17:15.965
Tell me about Pete now.

01:17:15.999 --> 01:17:19.736
He's a knocker. A "knocker"?

01:17:19.769 --> 01:17:22.906
A knocker is the guy that knocks
the cow inside of the head...

01:17:22.939 --> 01:17:26.009
So it won't struggle while
they slit its throat.

01:17:26.042 --> 01:17:29.312
I know. It's barbaric, isn't it?

01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:32.782
Does he still live
in the same town?

01:17:32.816 --> 01:17:36.319
Oh, just outside of town.

01:17:36.352 --> 01:17:38.988
He's got a little place,
but he's fixed it up nice.

01:17:39.022 --> 01:17:43.392
It's got some... trees
and a couple of acres...

01:17:47.797 --> 01:17:49.733
And a river.

01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:57.440
It reminds me of K-PAX,
except for the river.

01:18:01.811 --> 01:18:05.749
Tell me, did he ever marry
that pregnant girl?

01:18:08.151 --> 01:18:10.453
Wow, what a memory.

01:18:10.486 --> 01:18:14.690
Yeah, they got married, but she's no longer
pregnant. Why, that was six years ago.

01:18:15.825 --> 01:18:18.061
I've forgotten her name.

01:18:18.094 --> 01:18:19.963
S...

01:18:22.799 --> 01:18:24.500
I didn't tell you her name.

01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:26.469
Can you tell me now?

01:18:43.052 --> 01:18:45.088
Sara.

01:18:53.096 --> 01:18:55.865
Did they have a son
or a daughter?

01:19:00.837 --> 01:19:02.806
Rebecca.

01:19:08.511 --> 01:19:10.479
Rebecca.

01:19:16.019 --> 01:19:18.822
It's her birthday next week.

01:19:40.043 --> 01:19:42.946
Chak, what's happened?
Howie tried to kill Ernie.

01:19:42.979 --> 01:19:45.181
What? He's fine.

01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:51.420
Ernie? I feel wonderful, Dr.
Powell.

01:19:51.454 --> 01:19:53.614
For heaven's sake. What happened?
Absolutely wonderful.

01:19:55.058 --> 01:19:59.062
My good friend Howie, he just
about strangled me to death.

01:19:59.095 --> 01:20:02.165
What?

01:20:02.198 --> 01:20:04.067
Son of a bitch, i love him.

01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:06.035
Ernie, I don't understand.

01:20:06.069 --> 01:20:08.938
You should've seen it.

01:20:08.972 --> 01:20:12.876
I was asleep. You know, the way I
like... my hands tied and everything.

01:20:12.909 --> 01:20:15.320
He wrapped something around my
neck... a handkerchief or something...

01:20:15.344 --> 01:20:17.914
And then tightened it.

01:20:17.947 --> 01:20:19.949
There wasn't a damn thing
i could do about it.

01:20:19.983 --> 01:20:22.451
Well, when i stopped breathing,

01:20:22.485 --> 01:20:24.487
he lifted me onto the
gurney, rushed me up here,

01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:27.290
and they brought me back
as quick as they could.

01:20:27.323 --> 01:20:29.558
And when I woke up,

01:20:32.128 --> 01:20:34.097
you know what I realized, Dr.
Powell?

01:20:36.399 --> 01:20:39.402
Dying.

01:20:39.435 --> 01:20:42.505
Dying's something you
have no control over.

01:20:43.907 --> 01:20:47.877
Why waste your life
being afraid of it?

01:20:47.911 --> 01:20:50.213
I'll sleep on my
stomach from now on.

01:20:50.246 --> 01:20:52.415
I'll eat fish with bones in it.

01:20:52.448 --> 01:20:54.951
I'll swallow the biggest pill you can find.
Bring it on.

01:20:54.984 --> 01:20:58.154
I feel good.

01:21:02.125 --> 01:21:04.961
That's terrific, Ernie.

01:21:07.396 --> 01:21:10.033
See you at our session tomorrow?
Yes.

01:21:13.002 --> 01:21:14.938
I cured him, didn't I?

01:21:17.573 --> 01:21:22.145
Prot says one more task
and I'll be cured too.

01:21:22.178 --> 01:21:25.348
And then it's... Bon voyage.

01:22:37.186 --> 01:22:39.222
Tell me your name, damn it.

01:22:59.342 --> 01:23:02.078
I'm gonna give you
a specific date,

01:23:02.111 --> 01:23:05.090
and I want you to remember where you were
and what you were doing on that day.

01:23:05.114 --> 01:23:07.283
Do you understand?

01:23:07.316 --> 01:23:09.385
Perfectly well, my dear sir.

01:23:09.418 --> 01:23:14.390
The date is July 27, 1996.

01:23:15.791 --> 01:23:17.393
I'm on K-PAX.

01:23:19.295 --> 01:23:22.165
- Are you sure?
- Quite sure, governor.

01:23:22.198 --> 01:23:24.433
I'm harvesting
croppins for a meal.

01:23:24.467 --> 01:23:28.237
Croppins are a fungi,
like, uh, your truffles.

01:23:28.271 --> 01:23:30.273
Big truffles. Delicious.
Do you like tru...

01:23:34.677 --> 01:23:36.679
Wait a minute.

01:23:38.814 --> 01:23:40.783
There it is. What? Is it Pete?

01:23:40.816 --> 01:23:42.785
Yes.

01:23:44.153 --> 01:23:47.022
I sense something is wrong.
He needs me.

01:23:50.426 --> 01:23:52.695
I'm now on earth.

01:23:52.728 --> 01:23:55.131
I'm with him.

01:23:55.164 --> 01:23:57.733
And where are you?
What are you doing?

01:23:58.834 --> 01:24:01.637
By a river...

01:24:01.670 --> 01:24:05.141
In the back of his house.

01:24:05.174 --> 01:24:07.143
It's dark.

01:24:08.877 --> 01:24:10.846
He's taking off his clothes.

01:24:10.879 --> 01:24:12.781
Why is he doing that?

01:24:12.815 --> 01:24:15.551
He's... what?

01:24:15.584 --> 01:24:17.820
What is he doing?

01:24:20.389 --> 01:24:22.391
He's trying to kill himself.

01:24:24.193 --> 01:24:26.729
Why does he want
to kill himself?

01:24:32.568 --> 01:24:36.139
Because something
terrible has happened.

01:24:36.172 --> 01:24:39.108
Has he done something? Has he
done something he shouldn't have?

01:24:39.142 --> 01:24:41.076
He doesn't want
to talk about it.

01:24:41.110 --> 01:24:44.613
Prot, I'm trying to help him. I can't help
him unless he tells me what happened.

01:24:44.647 --> 01:24:46.815
He knows that.

01:24:46.849 --> 01:24:49.452
Well, then, why won't he tell me?

01:24:49.485 --> 01:24:52.555
Because then you would know...

01:24:52.588 --> 01:24:56.225
What even he doesn't
want to know.

01:24:56.259 --> 01:25:00.263
Then you have to help him, prot.

01:25:00.296 --> 01:25:02.498
You have to help him
tell me what happened.

01:25:02.531 --> 01:25:05.601
He doesn't want to talk about it.
Are you fucking deaf?

01:25:05.634 --> 01:25:07.836
Time is running out for him.

01:25:07.870 --> 01:25:10.373
Time is running
out for everyone.

01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:14.143
He jumps in.

01:25:14.177 --> 01:25:16.445
He's floating.

01:25:16.479 --> 01:25:18.481
Pulse is up to 140.
Respiration's at 30.

01:25:18.514 --> 01:25:20.149
For god's sake, man,
bring him back.

01:25:23.652 --> 01:25:25.521
All right. Listen to me.

01:25:25.554 --> 01:25:28.224
Listen to me.

01:25:28.257 --> 01:25:30.259
You can save him.
You're his friend.

01:25:30.293 --> 01:25:32.495
I am his friend. That's
why I won't try.

01:25:32.528 --> 01:25:34.497
Save him! No.

01:25:34.530 --> 01:25:36.499
I can't.

01:25:36.532 --> 01:25:39.468
The cur... the current
is too strong.

01:25:39.502 --> 01:25:42.238
There's no chance.

01:25:42.271 --> 01:25:45.641
I... cannot. Listen to me.

01:25:45.674 --> 01:25:47.676
You've helped a lot
of patients here.

01:25:47.710 --> 01:25:50.613
You've helped Mrs. Archer.
You've helped Howie and Ernie.

01:25:50.646 --> 01:25:52.415
I'm gonna ask you to
help cure Pete now.

01:25:54.250 --> 01:25:57.620
Let's call it a task.

01:25:57.653 --> 01:26:00.923
I want you to let me speak to him.

01:26:00.956 --> 01:26:04.360
If he's listening, i want him
to know that he can trust me.

01:26:04.393 --> 01:26:07.863
I want him to know that if it was Sara
or Rebecca that he did something...

01:26:13.302 --> 01:26:15.704
Get in there. No, no, no, wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

01:26:15.738 --> 01:26:20.543
No. No, stay back. Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!

01:26:20.576 --> 01:26:24.713
Oh, my god! Oh...

01:26:24.747 --> 01:26:27.216
Oh, my god!

01:26:27.250 --> 01:26:29.885
Oh, my god!

01:26:38.794 --> 01:26:40.829
It's okay.

01:26:40.863 --> 01:26:42.598
It's all right.

01:26:44.032 --> 01:26:46.702
Shh.

01:26:46.735 --> 01:26:48.704
That's okay.

01:26:48.737 --> 01:26:50.473
It's all right now.

01:26:53.542 --> 01:26:57.413
I'm gonna count backwards
now from five to one,

01:26:57.446 --> 01:27:00.583
and as I count, you'll
become more and more alert.

01:27:00.616 --> 01:27:02.585
On the count of one
I'll snap my fingers,

01:27:02.618 --> 01:27:05.421
and you'll wake up
feeling refreshed.

01:27:05.454 --> 01:27:08.791
Five. You're starting
to come out of it.

01:27:08.824 --> 01:27:11.660
Four. You're
becoming more alert.

01:27:11.694 --> 01:27:13.729
Three. Even more alert.

01:27:13.762 --> 01:27:15.698
Two. You're starting
to wake up now.

01:27:15.731 --> 01:27:17.500
And one.

01:27:26.542 --> 01:27:29.778
Are you okay? Yes.

01:27:29.812 --> 01:27:31.814
Feeling fine.

01:27:31.847 --> 01:27:33.716
Okay.

01:28:23.131 --> 01:28:26.068
Thank you.

01:28:34.377 --> 01:28:38.347
Is this... is this area code 5-0-5?
Where are you?

01:28:38.381 --> 01:28:40.583
New Mexico, sir.
New Mexico?

01:28:44.119 --> 01:28:46.321
"Salva."

01:28:49.725 --> 01:28:51.494
Salvation.

01:28:53.128 --> 01:28:55.931
Salvation!

01:28:55.964 --> 01:28:58.534
There are a dozen salvation
army shelters in new Mexico.

01:28:58.567 --> 01:29:02.671
Albuquerque, las
cruces, roswell.

01:29:02.705 --> 01:29:07.943
Wait a minute. There's one in Santa Rosa.
Santa Rosa. Santa Rosa.

01:29:07.976 --> 01:29:09.778
Santa Rosa.

01:29:12.681 --> 01:29:14.783
Guelph.

01:29:14.817 --> 01:29:17.986
That's pretty damn
close to Santa Rosa.

01:29:18.020 --> 01:29:20.088
What's the biggest local
newspaper for that region?

01:29:22.024 --> 01:29:25.394
Guadalupe county observer,
covering Guadalupe county.

01:29:25.428 --> 01:29:27.029
All right. Bring that up.

01:29:28.130 --> 01:29:32.034
Go to July 27, 1996.

01:29:33.902 --> 01:29:36.772
"Swap meet, livestock sale."

01:29:36.805 --> 01:29:38.807
Wait. Go to the 28th.

01:29:38.841 --> 01:29:40.709
Okay.

01:29:40.743 --> 01:29:42.978
There it is!

01:29:43.011 --> 01:29:45.848
"Robert Porter. Drowned!"

01:29:46.949 --> 01:29:49.785
His name...

01:29:49.818 --> 01:29:51.654
Is Robert Porter.

01:30:33.562 --> 01:30:36.431
Robert Porter. Ah, here it is.

01:30:37.633 --> 01:30:39.401
Yeah, I do remember this case.

01:30:39.434 --> 01:30:42.070
It was about the biggest thing
ever happened around these parts.

01:30:43.806 --> 01:30:47.142
He was a quiet type.

01:30:47.175 --> 01:30:50.813
As I recall, he was a real smart fella.
Kind of brainy.

01:30:50.846 --> 01:30:53.649
Strong as a horse, though,
and worked as a knocker.

01:30:53.682 --> 01:30:57.085
Lived about 20 miles outside of
town with his-his wife and child.

01:30:58.921 --> 01:31:01.123
Sara.

01:31:01.156 --> 01:31:03.125
His wife's name was Sara.

01:31:03.158 --> 01:31:05.828
That's right.

01:31:05.861 --> 01:31:08.030
Damn shame what happened.

01:31:09.732 --> 01:31:11.600
You got time to take a ride?

01:31:11.634 --> 01:31:14.202
Yeah.

01:31:39.562 --> 01:31:41.496
Well, it's been empty.

01:31:42.998 --> 01:31:45.067
Yeah, nobody comes around
here much anymore...

01:31:45.100 --> 01:31:47.235
Since all that happened.

01:31:49.304 --> 01:31:52.608
Ain't no livin' next of kin
to give the place to anyway.

01:32:02.918 --> 01:32:05.320
I had detectives come
down from Albuquerque...

01:32:05.353 --> 01:32:07.790
To try and piece
this one together.

01:32:13.896 --> 01:32:16.899
Well, accordin' to
the official story,

01:32:16.932 --> 01:32:19.768
Porter, he was at work when
this, uh, this drifter,

01:32:19.802 --> 01:32:23.806
Darryl Walker,
come by the house.

01:32:23.839 --> 01:32:27.643
Two-time parolee lookin' for trouble.
You know what I'm sayin'?

01:32:27.676 --> 01:32:29.778
Started out as a robbery.

01:32:29.812 --> 01:32:33.248
The wife and the
daughter were out back.

01:32:33.281 --> 01:32:36.184
Sara?

01:32:36.218 --> 01:32:38.921
Sara?

01:32:38.954 --> 01:32:42.190
From what we can gather
from forensics and all,

01:32:42.224 --> 01:32:45.661
this Walker, he, uh... he forced
the two women into the house.

01:32:55.971 --> 01:32:58.874
Raped the wife,

01:32:58.907 --> 01:33:01.610
killed 'em both.

01:33:07.115 --> 01:33:09.685
Porter, he must've come home
and found Walker still here.

01:33:23.298 --> 01:33:25.801
God.

01:33:25.834 --> 01:33:28.704

neck like it was a twig.

01:35:51.513 --> 01:35:54.449

They found the clothes there.

01:36:32.354 --> 01:36:35.290
That's probably
where he jumped in.

01:36:35.323 --> 01:36:37.926
And this river can be
pretty treacherous.

01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:40.095
Even in July it's got
a hell of a current.

01:36:40.128 --> 01:36:44.099
Still, I suppose it might have
been a mistake, officially,

01:36:44.132 --> 01:36:47.970
to declare it a drowning when
the body was never found.

01:36:48.003 --> 01:36:49.704
Doc,

01:36:49.737 --> 01:36:53.308
if that boy you got back there in
New York is really Robert Porter,

01:36:53.341 --> 01:36:56.111
I'd just as soon
not know about it.

01:36:56.144 --> 01:36:58.113

You all packed? Ready to go?

01:39:27.729 --> 01:39:31.433
Quite ready. I travel light.

01:39:31.466 --> 01:39:34.202
That's a joke, mark.

01:39:34.236 --> 01:39:38.273
You humans. There's
just no sense of humor.

01:39:38.306 --> 01:39:42.177
I doubt, uh, Freud
ever tried this,

01:39:42.210 --> 01:39:44.446
but before someone goes away,

01:39:44.479 --> 01:39:47.515
we usually like to send them
off with a little toast.

01:39:47.549 --> 01:39:51.286
Scotch okay, or would you
prefer something more fruity?

01:39:52.654 --> 01:39:55.123
I will try the scotch.

01:40:01.496 --> 01:40:03.531
Well,

01:40:03.565 --> 01:40:05.600
here's to a...

01:40:05.633 --> 01:40:08.303
Safe journey.

01:40:29.824 --> 01:40:32.026
Tell you the truth,

01:40:33.528 --> 01:40:36.164
K-PAX sounds like a
beautiful place.

01:40:38.233 --> 01:40:41.303
I'd like to see it sometime.
Think there's a chance of that?

01:40:42.737 --> 01:40:45.340
I think you should see
more of your world.

01:40:45.373 --> 01:40:48.443
As a matter of fact, i think you
should see more of your own family.

01:40:49.877 --> 01:40:52.180
Invite your son for Christmas.

01:40:55.483 --> 01:40:58.186
I may just do that, prot.

01:41:00.322 --> 01:41:03.291
You know what I've learned
about your planet?

01:41:03.325 --> 01:41:06.561
There's enough life on
earth to fill 50 planets...

01:41:06.594 --> 01:41:09.764
Plants, animals, people,
fungi, viruses...

01:41:09.797 --> 01:41:12.567
All jostling to
find their place,

01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:15.270
bouncing off each other,
feeding off each other,

01:41:16.471 --> 01:41:18.273
connected.

01:41:20.475 --> 01:41:24.446
You don't have that kind
of connection on K-PAX?

01:41:24.479 --> 01:41:27.315
Nobody wants, nobody needs.

01:41:27.349 --> 01:41:29.417
On K-PAX, when I'm gone,
nobody misses me.

01:41:29.451 --> 01:41:32.187
There would be no reason to.

01:41:32.220 --> 01:41:34.756
And yet I sense that
when I leave here,

01:41:37.759 --> 01:41:39.761
I will be missed.

01:41:41.463 --> 01:41:43.298
Yes.

01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:47.335
Strange feeling.

01:41:47.369 --> 01:41:50.205
You don't have to leave, prot.

01:41:50.238 --> 01:41:53.775
I'm sure there must be some
way that I can help you...

01:41:53.808 --> 01:41:57.812
To stay as one of us.

01:42:04.919 --> 01:42:08.256
I will miss you, Dr. Powell.

01:42:18.900 --> 01:42:21.369
Oh.

01:42:21.403 --> 01:42:23.438
And I have to finish
my report, but...

01:42:26.408 --> 01:42:29.744
I seem to have
misplaced my pencil.

01:42:42.424 --> 01:42:44.226
Take mine.

01:42:52.467 --> 01:42:55.403
A much more efficient
writing tool.

01:43:00.842 --> 01:43:02.844
Adios, my friend.

01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:08.616
Prot?

01:43:08.650 --> 01:43:10.885
I wanna show you something.

01:43:20.962 --> 01:43:22.830
That is Robert Porter.

01:43:22.864 --> 01:43:25.733
Prot, that's you.

01:43:25.767 --> 01:43:28.570
You and Robert Porter
are the same person.

01:43:28.603 --> 01:43:32.440
That's patently absurd.
I'm not even human.

01:43:32.474 --> 01:43:36.411
Can't you at least
admit the possibility?

01:43:36.444 --> 01:43:39.281
I will admit the possibility
that I am Robert Porter...

01:43:40.548 --> 01:43:43.318
If you will admit
the possibility...

01:43:43.351 --> 01:43:45.587
That I am from K-PAX.

01:43:47.889 --> 01:43:51.493
Now if you'll excuse me,

01:43:51.526 --> 01:43:53.861
I have a beam of light to catch.

01:43:56.564 --> 01:43:58.366
Oh, mark.

01:44:00.902 --> 01:44:03.905
Now that you've found Robert,

01:44:03.938 --> 01:44:06.808
please take good care of him.

01:44:16.017 --> 01:44:18.953
♪ That nobody can deny

01:44:18.986 --> 01:44:22.023
♪ that nobody can deny

01:44:22.056 --> 01:44:24.959
♪ for he's a... i can't stand it.

01:44:24.992 --> 01:44:28.963
I... I can't stand this!

01:44:28.996 --> 01:44:31.733
I demand to know...

01:44:31.766 --> 01:44:34.602
Which one of us is
goin' with you.

01:44:35.970 --> 01:44:38.973
Well, I can tell you this.

01:44:39.006 --> 01:44:43.511
There's extra points for the
one who goes to sleep first.

01:44:46.348 --> 01:44:49.317
Out of my way!

01:44:49.351 --> 01:44:51.619
Oh, my gosh.

01:44:55.823 --> 01:44:59.361
You never gave me my last task.

01:45:01.763 --> 01:45:04.466
What's my last task?

01:45:11.773 --> 01:45:13.975
To stay here.

01:45:16.678 --> 01:45:18.646
And be prepared...

01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:21.315
For anything.

01:46:20.475 --> 01:46:23.611
You look tired, doc. Why don't
you get a few hours of rest?

01:46:23.645 --> 01:46:26.481
He's not goin' anywhere. Uh...

01:46:26.514 --> 01:46:28.683
We got seven hours. I'll
see you in four, hmm?

01:46:28.716 --> 01:46:30.652
Get some rest.

01:46:43.831 --> 01:46:45.633
You're gonna eat.

01:46:47.735 --> 01:46:50.171
You need some food and
you need to sleep.

01:46:51.706 --> 01:46:54.041
Chow fun.

01:46:54.075 --> 01:46:56.911
Oh, the place on Broadway with
the ugly lanterns in the window?

01:46:56.944 --> 01:46:59.781
The mean waiter
always shouted at us.

01:46:59.814 --> 01:47:02.484
Their fortune cookies never
had any fortunes in 'em.

01:47:05.820 --> 01:47:07.722
We never needed any.

01:47:08.956 --> 01:47:11.793
I knew my fortune that night.

01:47:11.826 --> 01:47:14.962
He was sitting right
in front of me.

01:47:14.996 --> 01:47:17.431
Hope he still is.

01:47:35.817 --> 01:47:38.920
Hey. What's up, man?

01:47:38.953 --> 01:47:41.589
Look, 20 says he goes.
You're on.

01:48:19.126 --> 01:48:21.829
Shit!

01:48:24.999 --> 01:48:26.768
Oh, damn it!

01:48:32.039 --> 01:48:35.577
Two minutes. You know where Dr.
Powell is?

01:48:35.610 --> 01:48:37.545
I'll buzz him.

01:48:52.894 --> 01:48:54.629
One minute.

01:49:01.035 --> 01:49:03.671
Here comes Dr. Powell!

01:49:16.283 --> 01:49:18.185
He's moving.

01:49:18.219 --> 01:49:20.054
Repeat: He's moving!

01:49:20.087 --> 01:49:21.856
What the hell?

01:49:37.271 --> 01:49:39.774
Wait for me, you...

01:49:57.258 --> 01:49:59.761
Son of a bitch.

01:50:08.002 --> 01:50:09.837
Oh, god.

01:50:13.374 --> 01:50:16.210
Oh, man. Oh, god.

01:50:16.243 --> 01:50:19.881
Call a code blue. Help me.
Let's get him.

01:50:35.429 --> 01:50:38.666
Who's that? Beats me.
How'd he get in here?

01:50:38.700 --> 01:50:42.436
That's not prot. He's
definitely not prot.

01:50:42.469 --> 01:50:45.406
Certainly not. Prot's gone.

01:50:48.943 --> 01:50:51.012
Where's Bess?

01:50:51.045 --> 01:50:54.015
Where's Bess? Bess?

01:51:06.928 --> 01:51:09.030
He chose Bess.

01:51:09.063 --> 01:51:11.132
Bitch!

01:51:11.165 --> 01:51:13.667
Good-bye, Bess.

01:51:15.402 --> 01:51:17.972
Good for you, homegirl.

01:51:36.357 --> 01:51:39.426
Bess went to K-PAX.

01:52:01.983 --> 01:52:05.286
Patient 287, Robert Porter.

01:52:07.054 --> 01:52:10.291
How I wish I could say that
Robert sat up one fine day...

01:52:10.324 --> 01:52:12.927
And said, "I'm hungry.
Got any fruit?"

01:52:14.962 --> 01:52:17.832
Like most catatonics,

01:52:17.865 --> 01:52:19.801
he probably hears
every word we say...

01:52:19.834 --> 01:52:22.770
But refuses or is
unable to respond.

01:52:24.305 --> 01:52:28.309
Nevertheless, i keep
him up to date.

01:52:31.212 --> 01:52:33.514
Let's see. I told
you about Howie.

01:52:33.547 --> 01:52:35.783
He got that job at
the public library.

01:52:37.318 --> 01:52:41.455
And Ernie, he's determined
to be a crisis counselor.

01:52:41.488 --> 01:52:45.459
The only one we're, uh, really
concerned about is Bess.

01:52:45.492 --> 01:52:48.129
You know, we've checked
halfway houses, shelters,

01:52:48.162 --> 01:52:50.764
churches, bus stops.

01:52:52.033 --> 01:52:54.869
Nothing.

01:52:54.902 --> 01:52:57.304
Uh, we don't understand.
It's like...

01:52:57.338 --> 01:53:00.041
People don't just disappear.

01:53:04.011 --> 01:53:06.580
July 27.

01:53:06.613 --> 01:53:09.550
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you?

01:53:11.919 --> 01:53:13.821
Robert?

01:53:18.425 --> 01:53:21.028
No.

01:53:21.062 --> 01:53:23.430
Well, maybe it'll come to you.

01:53:26.067 --> 01:53:28.202
Whenever you're ready,
I'll be waiting.

01:53:55.930 --> 01:53:58.332
I want to
tell you something, mark,

01:53:58.365 --> 01:54:00.534
something you do not yet know,

01:54:00.567 --> 01:54:03.871
but we K-PAXians have been around
long enough to have discovered.

01:54:05.372 --> 01:54:07.641
The universe will expand,

01:54:07.674 --> 01:54:10.011
then it will collapse
back on itself,

01:54:10.044 --> 01:54:12.479
and then it will expand again.

01:54:12.513 --> 01:54:15.917
It will repeat this
process forever.

01:54:15.950 --> 01:54:19.053
What you don't know is that when
the universe expands again,

01:54:19.086 --> 01:54:22.356
everything will be as it is now.

01:54:22.389 --> 01:54:24.367
Whatever mistakes you make
this time around, you will

01:54:24.391 --> 01:54:26.427
live through on your next pass.

01:54:26.460 --> 01:54:28.963
Every mistake you make...

01:54:28.996 --> 01:54:30.965
You will live through...

01:54:30.998 --> 01:54:35.236
Again and again, forever.

01:54:35.269 --> 01:54:38.940
So my advice to you is to get
it right this time around,

01:54:38.973 --> 01:54:41.508
because this time...

01:54:41.542 --> 01:54:43.978
Is all you have.

01:54:54.588 --> 01:54:58.459
You're lookin' great, Michael.
Think so?

01:54:58.492 --> 01:55:00.995
Thanks. How you doin'?

01:55:01.028 --> 01:55:03.130
Good. How was your...
How was your trip?

01:55:03.164 --> 01:55:05.199
