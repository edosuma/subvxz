There's this place
across town that sells

00:49.299 --> 00:51.672
this super-fancy ice cream
called "frozen yogurt."

00:51.672 --> 00:54.885

that's just birthday cake

I've got a lot of planting
to do before sundown.

pitched in and worked
together, we could--

01:08.188 --> 01:09.529
Nah, I'll just ask Gramma
to drive us.

01:09.529 --> 01:11.572
Ooh, I don't know
about that.

01:11.572 --> 01:14.534
I haven't seen her drive
in a while, so it might
not be the best idea--

01:14.534 --> 01:16.496
-Hey! I heard that.
-Ooh!

01:16.496 --> 01:17.908
Come on, kids.

01:17.908 --> 01:19.830
Let Gramma take you
for a spin.

01:19.830 --> 01:21.752
-[both] Yay!
-Hey, wait!

01:21.752 --> 01:24.004
Fine! Enjoy your yogurt.

in the old garage?

in the front yard.

that hunk of junk!

01:45.435 --> 01:47.527
Wow, Gramma, I didn't know
you had a car.

01:47.527 --> 01:49.399
There's a lot you don't
know about me, boy!

01:49.399 --> 01:51.361
I was the queen
of the track.

01:51.361 --> 01:53.493
Hot Rod Alice,
they called me.

01:53.493 --> 01:55.736
I was unstoppable!

01:55.736 --> 01:58.618
So that's where I inherited
my need for speed.

01:58.618 --> 01:59.910

came out of nowhere!

02:09.840 --> 02:11.091
You all saw it.

02:11.091 --> 02:13.383
I sure saw it,
and felt it, too!

02:13.383 --> 02:17.597
Looks like we've gotten
ourselves into a delicious
little T-bone here. [laughs]

02:17.597 --> 02:20.310
Ma'am, I'm gonna need
to see your license, please.

02:20.310 --> 02:22.432
Hmm! There.
Read it and weep.

02:22.432 --> 02:26.266
Oh, my! Your license expired
before I was even born.

Looks like you'll have
to get a new one!

02:27.728 --> 02:30.230
Oh, well,
what a shame, Officer.

02:30.230 --> 02:34.614

you can do to help out
a girl in need.

-Ugh.

02:36.827 --> 02:38.408
Huh, I'm afraid not,
Ms. Green.

02:38.408 --> 02:41.041
You see, a license like this
has no purpose any more.

02:41.041 --> 02:43.834
It's old.
It's useless.

02:43.834 --> 02:47.167
Oh, look! It's actually turning
to dust right before our eyes.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.419
Anywhoo, ticket time!

02:49.419 --> 02:52.052
Ms. Green, if you ever want
to get behind the wheel again,

02:52.052 --> 02:54.294
you'll have to retake
the driver's test.

02:54.294 --> 02:56.296
[laughs] Okay, now I'm
gonna go call

02:56.296 --> 02:58.348
a tow truck for
and an ambulance for me!

03:07.307 --> 03:09.770
Listen, Ma, you don't
need your license.

03:09.770 --> 03:11.361
Now that
we all live together,

03:11.361 --> 03:13.443
I can drive you
wherever you need to go,

03:13.443 --> 03:15.696
so you can just sit here
and do nothin'.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.407
I'm gonna go
with the tow truck guy.

03:17.407 --> 03:19.119
I'll be back later.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.824
Ah, don't listen to Dad.

03:23.824 --> 03:25.746
I bet you'll ace
that driver's test.

03:25.746 --> 03:27.878
You'll be back
on the road in no time.

03:27.878 --> 03:29.419

that test!

is a tyrant!

to him or anyone else!

Wow.
Gramma's really mad.

03:37.297 --> 03:38.839
She's even grinding
her teeth.

03:41.101 --> 03:42.512
Why's she so upset?

03:42.512 --> 03:44.895
Maybe she just needs
a confidence boost.

03:44.895 --> 03:48.688
Hmm. Tilly, you're right,
and I know just how to do it!

03:50.981 --> 03:52.562
Hey, Gramma.

03:52.562 --> 03:55.115
There's something outside
I need to show you.

03:55.115 --> 03:59.029
Oh, Tilly, did you
turn the backyard
into a rat circus again?

03:59.029 --> 04:01.281
Nope. This is even better.

04:02.702 --> 04:03.914
What the--?

How to Not Crash Cars!

on this baby "rightch" here.

how to drive,

don't need to take lessons

at this, Gramma!

your granddaughter apart!

04:42.783 --> 04:44.244
Okay.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.960
All right, Ms. Green,
let's take this nice and slow.

04:49.960 --> 04:52.122
Go ahead and shift
into "turtle" for me.

04:52.122 --> 04:54.124
Ooh, come on, Alice.

04:54.124 --> 04:55.796
Pull yourself together.

04:55.796 --> 04:59.299
Very good.
Now, head towards those cones.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.511
Easy, easy.

05:01.511 --> 05:03.974
We're turning,
still turning.

05:03.974 --> 05:05.806
And boom!
There we go.

05:05.806 --> 05:09.099

This ain't too bad.

now a teenager

05:23.613 --> 05:26.076
and is going through
a rebellious phase!

05:27.207 --> 05:29.499
Nice work, Gramma!

05:29.499 --> 05:32.662
And now it's just slow
and steady to the finish line.

05:32.662 --> 05:35.215
Eh, I got
a better idea.

05:35.215 --> 05:37.047

were you thinking?

05:52.893 --> 05:54.434
This wasn't part
of the plan.

05:54.434 --> 05:57.477
The road holds many
unexpected surprises.

to be run over.

We're not finished.

Huh. Givin' up
isn't like her at all.

06:19.960 --> 06:23.884
I think it's time we took
this plan from turtle to rabbit.

06:25.305 --> 06:26.846
Hey, Gramma,
I got something I need to--

06:26.846 --> 06:29.059
No, Cricket,
I'm done with drivin'!

06:29.059 --> 06:30.720
No more crazy schemes.

how you truly feel...

[Cricket] I'm real sorry
about that, Gramma.

to take the wheel and drive.

09:04.754 --> 09:06.796
You might not be
Hot Rod Alice anymore,

09:06.796 --> 09:09.589
but that's okay, because you're
something even better:

09:09.589 --> 09:12.722
-Our gramma.
-Our Hot Rod Gramma!

09:12.722 --> 09:15.675
Oh, kids, come here.

09:15.675 --> 09:17.137
-[crashing]
-[screaming]

09:17.137 --> 09:18.268
[Cricket]
This one's going down!

09:19.849 --> 09:21.771
[screaming]

09:21.771 --> 09:23.683
Holy crunch-a-munga!

09:23.683 --> 09:26.736
Looks like the diesel dino
has found its next victim.

09:26.736 --> 09:30.110
Eat their souls,
Crunch-a-saurus!

09:30.110 --> 09:31.321
That's it!

09:31.321 --> 09:33.323
No more mopin' around!

09:33.323 --> 09:36.826
Time to show everyone
what Hot Rod Gramma can do!

09:36.826 --> 09:39.749
[tires squealing]

09:44.043 --> 09:46.876
Crunch-a-saurus, no!

09:46.876 --> 09:48.708
Crunchy, no!

09:48.708 --> 09:51.211
My beautiful metal boy!

09:51.211 --> 09:52.422
Go, Gramma!

09:52.422 --> 09:54.304
Told you I know
how to drive.

09:59.139 --> 10:00.720
Step on it, Gramma!

10:00.720 --> 10:02.892
I've got
a better idea.

10:02.892 --> 10:04.274
[quavering]

10:06.566 --> 10:08.188
[signal clicking]

10:08.188 --> 10:11.281
That's a little something
I call the Turtle Maneuver.

10:11.281 --> 10:12.782
Learned it
from the best.

10:12.782 --> 10:14.324
Now, let's
go home!

10:14.324 --> 10:15.575
[both] Yay!

10:15.575 --> 10:18.578
[crowd booing]

10:20.500 --> 10:21.741
There. Good as new.

10:21.741 --> 10:23.913
Next I just gotta
fix the tractor, my truck,

10:23.913 --> 10:25.835
and everything else
that Ma broke.

10:25.835 --> 10:27.547
I heard that!

10:27.547 --> 10:28.838
Gramma! You're back!

10:28.838 --> 10:31.671
How'd the driver's test go,
Hot Rod?

10:31.671 --> 10:35.555
Well, naturally your old grandma
aced it with flying colors.

10:35.555 --> 10:37.016
Of course, I can't
drive on freeways

10:37.016 --> 10:39.219
or after dark,
but I still got it!

10:39.219 --> 10:41.311
Now, who wants
frozen yogurt?

10:41.311 --> 10:43.763
-I'll drive.
-Yeah!

10:43.763 --> 10:45.525
Well, with all
the work to do still,

10:45.525 --> 10:47.767
it sure would go
a lot faster if we all--

10:47.767 --> 10:49.359
Nah. Bye, Dad!

10:49.359 --> 10:50.770
[groans]

10:50.770 --> 10:53.323
Well, at least I got you
to help me out.

10:53.323 --> 10:56.366
[electronically laughs]
Happy Halloween!

10:56.366 --> 10:59.279
Uh... sure.
Happy Halloween.

11:02.912 --> 11:05.745
[scatting]

11:05.745 --> 11:07.917
- Hey!
- Whoo!

11:07.917 --> 11:09.919
Look, I don't know
how you pay for things

11:09.919 --> 11:11.591
back in Hickville or wherever,

11:11.591 --> 11:14.424
but a little dance ain't gonna
buy yourself a burrito.

11:14.424 --> 11:16.926
I bet you'd trade for an ear
of golden corn

11:16.926 --> 11:17.797
from my dad's garden.

11:17.797 --> 11:21.100
Kid, do I look stupid?
[grunts]

11:21.100 --> 11:23.893
Uh, a little bit.
[gasps] What the heck?!

11:23.893 --> 11:25.435
Stop right there.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.438
Oh, hey, kids.

11:28.438 --> 11:31.441
Meet my new friends
from Animal Control!

11:31.441 --> 11:33.523
My, my,
what large weapons you have.

11:33.523 --> 11:34.864
Howdy, officers.

11:34.864 --> 11:36.986
Animal Control?
What do you do?

11:36.986 --> 11:38.408
We control animals.

11:38.408 --> 11:40.910
Hey, that trash
is city property!

11:40.910 --> 11:42.912
[squawks, snores]

11:42.912 --> 11:44.284
Sorry about that, citizen.

11:44.284 --> 11:45.745
Looks like we've mistook you

11:45.745 --> 11:47.126
for the wild bear
that's on the loose.

11:47.126 --> 11:49.379
- A bear?!
- That's right.

11:49.379 --> 11:52.832
A terrifying grizzly bear
has been sighted in Big City,

11:52.832 --> 11:54.294
and it has to be caught!

11:54.294 --> 11:56.926
You're talking to the right guy.
I hate bears.

11:56.926 --> 11:58.968
They're monsters and nothing
would make me happier

11:58.968 --> 12:00.800
than bringing one to justice.

12:00.800 --> 12:02.682
If you see any trace
of the beast...

12:02.682 --> 12:04.394
[singsong] call me!

12:05.935 --> 12:07.437
I knew the day would come

12:07.437 --> 12:09.609
where I would have to hunt down
a giant grizzly.

12:09.609 --> 12:10.980
[hawk cries]

12:10.980 --> 12:13.733
I just never thought
it would be so soon.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.525
Now who wants to capture bear?

12:15.525 --> 12:18.197
Yeah! Wait, why?
Why would we do that?

12:18.197 --> 12:20.660
Cricket has never found bears
agreeable.

12:20.660 --> 12:22.282
You're dang right!
Bears are a menace.

12:22.282 --> 12:25.415
They'll terrorize the innocent,
rifle through our garbage,

12:25.415 --> 12:26.416
and, if left unchecked,

12:26.416 --> 12:28.668
will eventually destroy
this good city!

12:28.668 --> 12:30.870
[bear roaring]

12:30.870 --> 12:32.962
Really? You must have dealt
with a lot of bears

12:32.962 --> 12:34.584
back in the country, huh?

12:34.584 --> 12:36.085
Remy, I've never been met
a bear in my life,

12:36.085 --> 12:38.007
and for that,
I consider myself lucky.

12:38.007 --> 12:40.470
You don't need to meet a bear
to know they're awful.

12:40.470 --> 12:41.841
Well, sounds good to me.

12:41.841 --> 12:43.973
Now let's go catch ourselves
a bear!

12:43.973 --> 12:46.015
[both cheer]

12:46.015 --> 12:49.809
Hello, I'd like guacamole
on my burrito!

12:52.852 --> 12:54.734
What? Hmm.

12:54.734 --> 12:56.736
- Whoa!
- Gotcha, bear.

12:56.736 --> 12:59.659
Oh, whoops,
just another jogger.

12:59.659 --> 13:01.110
Sorry about that, sir.

13:01.110 --> 13:03.533
I think this
ought to make us square.

13:03.533 --> 13:05.745
Your silence
is appreciated.

13:05.745 --> 13:08.868
You know what they say.
12th times the charm.

13:08.868 --> 13:10.290
That's the spirit, Remy.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.752
Now let's get back
into position.

13:12.752 --> 13:14.674
Hmm, this is a fuzzy tree.

13:14.674 --> 13:16.876
- [growling]
- Huh?

13:19.008 --> 13:20.920
Oh, my gosh.
You found the bear.

13:20.920 --> 13:22.882
Oh, my gosh!
I found the bear!

13:22.882 --> 13:24.053
[roars]

13:24.053 --> 13:26.015
[all scream]

13:26.015 --> 13:29.519
Agh! Oh, it's gonna eat me!
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead!

13:29.519 --> 13:31.431
Look away!
I don't want you to see this!

13:31.431 --> 13:32.932
- [both] Cricket!
- [grunts]

13:32.932 --> 13:34.193
[bear grunts happily]

13:34.193 --> 13:37.357
What's going on?
Playing with your food, huh?

13:37.357 --> 13:39.359
Well, I'm taking myself
off the menu!

13:39.359 --> 13:41.280
How do you like that?!

13:41.280 --> 13:43.072
[grunts] Whoa!

13:43.072 --> 13:44.364
Put 'em up, put 'em up!

13:44.364 --> 13:46.155
I got you
right where I want you.

13:46.155 --> 13:47.206
How you like that?!

13:47.206 --> 13:49.288
I'm crushing the wind
out of your chest!

13:49.288 --> 13:52.081
- [bear groans]
- I did it!

13:52.081 --> 13:54.414
[both] Yay!
According to the law,

13:54.414 --> 13:56.125
you are now my prisoner,
bear.

13:56.125 --> 13:58.508
I'll hold her.
Call it in, brother.

13:59.549 --> 14:00.760
There, there.

14:03.012 --> 14:06.095
Hello, animal control?
I'm about to make your day.

14:06.095 --> 14:07.597
You know that renegade bear?

14:07.597 --> 14:09.018
I happen to have it
in my custody.

14:09.018 --> 14:10.390
[bear growls]

14:10.390 --> 14:12.852
Oh, shoot,
she's getting away, Cricket!

14:12.852 --> 14:16.185
- Hey, bear, no escaping!
-<i> Kid! What's happening?!</i>

14:16.185 --> 14:18.067
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

14:18.067 --> 14:21.401
Oh, Cricket.
She just wants a burrito.

14:21.401 --> 14:24.404
Every prisoner deserves
a last meal.

14:24.404 --> 14:27.407
Cricket, that's crazy!
This is a wild animal!

14:27.407 --> 14:29.539
I think she's just
misunderstood.

14:29.539 --> 14:33.082
She's probably just new
around these parts like us.

14:33.082 --> 14:35.955
Hmm, I am a firm warden
but a fair one.

14:35.955 --> 14:38.127
I will grant the prisoner
one last meal.

14:38.127 --> 14:39.629
Ah!
And let's make it quick.

14:39.629 --> 14:41.841
[groans]

14:41.841 --> 14:43.002
Huh?

14:43.002 --> 14:45.505
One of your finest burritos,
please.

14:45.505 --> 14:47.717
[screams]
Take them all!

14:47.717 --> 14:49.138
Wow. Thanks.

14:49.138 --> 14:51.971
Thank you very much
for the burritos, Daisy.

14:51.971 --> 14:53.933
Jeez, Tilly.
Don't give it a name.

14:53.933 --> 14:56.516
It's a bear, not our friend.

14:56.516 --> 14:59.188
Okay, I can't watch this.
Let me do it.

14:59.188 --> 15:01.190
Stupid bear. Oh.

15:01.190 --> 15:04.233
You like fish burritos, too.
I thought I was the only one.

15:04.233 --> 15:06.285
[Daisy slurping]

15:06.285 --> 15:07.827
Okay, you got your meal.

15:07.827 --> 15:09.288
Now it's time you got
to Animal Control.

15:09.288 --> 15:12.662
- But, Cricket, she's parched.
- [smacks lips]

15:12.662 --> 15:15.374
Yeah, I guess she is looking
a little thirsty.

15:15.374 --> 15:17.457
All right, fine,
you softies.

15:17.457 --> 15:18.878
[laughs]

15:18.878 --> 15:21.210
[Daisy huffing,
all scream]

15:21.210 --> 15:23.713
Now hurry it up.
Ain't got all day.

15:27.176 --> 15:30.219
[chuckles] What a dummy.
Hmm?

15:30.219 --> 15:32.221
[scoffs]
Okay, it's time to turn you in.

15:32.221 --> 15:33.553
Oh, so soon?

15:33.553 --> 15:36.185
Yeah, you know,
she's kind of cute.

15:36.185 --> 15:39.979
Well, maybe after
a few more last requests.

16:01.751 --> 16:03.252
<i> ♪ And you ♪</i>

16:03.252 --> 16:04.964
[howls]

16:04.964 --> 16:07.677
That's us, everyone!
Thank you and good night!

16:07.677 --> 16:09.428
[all scream]

16:09.428 --> 16:11.971
- [both cheering]
- Please, please,
you're too kind.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.143
Ooh!
What should we sing next?

16:14.143 --> 16:16.516
Ooh, how about something
with a little country twang?

16:16.516 --> 16:18.768
- [groans]
- I see, a music snob.

16:18.768 --> 16:22.231
Well, we'll see about that.
[laughs] Cootchie-cootchie-coo.

16:22.231 --> 16:24.313
- Bear pile!
- [laughter]

16:24.313 --> 16:26.105
Freeze!
Put your paws in the air.

16:26.105 --> 16:28.317
[gasps]
Oh, my word, were too late!

16:28.317 --> 16:29.909
It's eating those kids!

16:33.202 --> 16:34.664
[groans sadly]

16:34.664 --> 16:36.666
- All right!
- Shotgun!

16:36.666 --> 16:38.457
We can't thank you enough,
kid.

16:38.457 --> 16:40.209
It was actually thanks
to your tip earlier

16:40.209 --> 16:42.211
that we were able to catch
this brute.

16:42.211 --> 16:44.463
Ha!
Funny how things work out.

16:44.463 --> 16:46.465
Oh, sure.
[chuckles] No problem.

16:46.465 --> 16:48.217
This is exactly what I wanted.

16:48.217 --> 16:49.258
[engine starts]

16:52.261 --> 16:54.053
Be gentle with her!

16:54.053 --> 16:56.055
She can't get to sleep
unless you sing to her!

16:56.055 --> 16:57.637
She loves being scratched
behind the ears!

16:57.637 --> 17:00.980
And I'm pretty sure her
favorite food is fish burritos!

17:04.814 --> 17:07.987
Cricket, was this
the right thing to do?

17:07.987 --> 17:11.360
I think so, Tilly.
But then why does my heart hurt?

17:11.360 --> 17:14.203
After all,
she was just a bear.

17:14.203 --> 17:16.075
Oh, who am I kidding?

17:16.075 --> 17:19.038
Daisy was more than a bear.
She was our friend.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.250
And friends don't leave
of friends in cold,

17:21.250 --> 17:23.372
animal-sized prison cells.

17:27.216 --> 17:28.297
Coo-ka-coo!

17:28.297 --> 17:30.720
That's our signal.

17:30.720 --> 17:34.263
A fried egg is not poached.
They're so different!

17:34.263 --> 17:35.935
[thump]

17:35.935 --> 17:37.016
Huh?

17:39.348 --> 17:41.140
Why?

17:41.140 --> 17:43.893
Oh, my gosh, we hit a kid!

17:43.893 --> 17:47.987
Rupert! You told me you were
gonna dance on the big stage!

17:47.987 --> 17:50.189
You can't give up now!

17:50.189 --> 17:52.531
Wait, Tilly, this isn't
what we practiced at all.

17:52.531 --> 17:54.574
I'm a free spirit.
Try to keep up.

17:54.574 --> 17:58.788
- Your father the Duke
never approved of us!
- Still dying! Oh!

17:58.788 --> 18:00.199
What is this?

18:00.199 --> 18:02.291
I don't know,
but I can't look away.

18:03.663 --> 18:05.875
Daisy! You're okay!

18:05.875 --> 18:08.207
[laughs]
Good to see you, too.

18:08.207 --> 18:10.630
Ow, okay, that hurts
more than it tackles.

18:10.630 --> 18:14.173
The wedding is cancelled!
[grunts]

18:14.173 --> 18:16.175
They were so young.

18:16.175 --> 18:18.097
Hey, do you guys smell pumpkin?

18:18.097 --> 18:20.219
Actually,
it's spaghetti squash.

18:20.219 --> 18:22.351
That small man is right!

18:22.351 --> 18:24.183
[gasps] Hey, get back here!

18:24.183 --> 18:27.436
Uh-oh. Time to go.
[yelps]

18:27.436 --> 18:29.729
Don't let that bear get away!

18:29.729 --> 18:31.490
[siren wailing]

18:31.490 --> 18:33.863
- That went well.
- I have some notes.

18:36.075 --> 18:38.698

18:38.698 --> 18:40.620
Daisy,
look out for those joggers!

18:44.293 --> 18:45.835
I'm back to selling burritos.

18:45.835 --> 18:48.417
Ain't nothing gonna stop me now.

18:48.417 --> 18:50.209
No!!

18:54.213 --> 18:56.215
They're gaining on us!
[yelps]

18:58.597 --> 19:00.179
We're going around!

19:05.104 --> 19:08.267
Aw, Daisy, I didn't mean for it
all to go down like this.

19:08.267 --> 19:10.569
I used to think bears
were uncivilized,

19:10.569 --> 19:14.273
savage hair monsters,
but you're pretty great.

19:14.273 --> 19:16.826
You know, you and I
aren't so different.

19:16.826 --> 19:19.158
A lot of people say<i> I</i> don't
belong in the city.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.540
So if you want to stay here,
then I got your back.

19:21.540 --> 19:24.333
But what's the best hiding spot
for a city bear?

19:24.333 --> 19:26.706
- [groaning]
- Hey, what are you doing?

19:28.748 --> 19:30.459
Daisy, where do you think
you're going?

19:30.459 --> 19:31.460
You can't live in the sewer.

19:36.345 --> 19:38.347
Wait a second,
there's food here.

19:38.347 --> 19:41.060
It's damp like a cave,
and there's even running water.

19:41.060 --> 19:44.513
Well, if this is where you want
to stay, Daisy, it's fine by me.

19:44.513 --> 19:47.356
I mean, I wish I could stay
with you,

19:47.356 --> 19:49.188
but with you living
in a sewer and all,

19:49.188 --> 19:50.519
it's just kind of gross.

19:50.519 --> 19:53.402
So I guess this is goodbye.

19:53.402 --> 19:55.524
Okay, well I guess
you'd better get out of here

19:55.524 --> 19:57.316
before one of us starts crying.

19:57.316 --> 19:58.738
[moans sadly]

20:01.911 --> 20:04.533
Heh, Cricket Green
helping a bear.

20:04.533 --> 20:05.875
What a crazy world.

20:05.875 --> 20:10.669
End of the line, young man.
Let's nab ourselves a bear!

20:10.669 --> 20:14.043
Oh, you want a bear, do you?
Well, you're in luck!

20:14.043 --> 20:16.385
Y'all got yourselves
a sewer bear now!

20:16.385 --> 20:18.297
[grunts]

20:20.339 --> 20:21.340
Oh, my.

20:31.400 --> 20:33.062
Hoo boy! [laughs]

20:33.062 --> 20:37.276
Well,
I hope you're happy, kid.

20:37.276 --> 20:39.568
Not only did we lose
the bear's trail,

20:39.568 --> 20:41.660
but my new boots
are completely ruined!

20:41.660 --> 20:45.494
Pack it up, boys,
we're getting out of here.

20:45.494 --> 20:48.577
[both laugh]

20:48.577 --> 20:50.369
You hear that, girl?
We did it.

20:50.369 --> 20:52.331
And with little
to no consequences, too.

20:52.331 --> 20:55.134
[sneezes] Huh.
That can't be good.

20:55.134 --> 20:58.087
Yep, that's a fever,
all right.

20:58.087 --> 21:00.179
Well, that's what you get
for playing in the sewer.

21:00.179 --> 21:02.842
Ah, nothing some of my
famous chili can't fix.

21:02.842 --> 21:04.383
[groans]

21:04.383 --> 21:06.936
We're proud of you, Cricket.
You did a good thing.

21:06.936 --> 21:08.307
Thanks, guys.

21:08.307 --> 21:11.520
- Are you contagious?
- Oh, very much so.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.602
<i> "My dearest, Daisy,</i>

21:13.602 --> 21:15.154
<i> I hope this letter
finds you well</i>

21:15.154 --> 21:18.197
