- No, I can take care of this myself.

that stuff again, Jerry?

07:39.792 --> 07:43.660

kicked it through his nose.

of muscle he was using...

13:37.349 --> 13:40.477

13:40.586 --> 13:43.783
No- [Stammering]

13:54.366 --> 13:56.425
Nobody's gonna find out about us.

13:56.535 --> 14:00.596
Only way they're gonna find out
is if you tell them, not me, right?

All I'm saying is, you know, the next time
you start adding up what I owe you...

15:11.110 --> 15:13.169

Not in this book.

Hey, where you going?

15:18.951 --> 15:23.149
Eh, I thought I'd give Rose and the kids a break.
You know, take 'em out to dinner.

Oh, shit. I forgot to ask you.
How is she?

Is everything all right?
You don't usually call me at home.

01:27:46.427 --> 01:27:49.294
Everything is lousy.

01:27:49.397 --> 01:27:51.422
Why? Why?

01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:55.960
On account of the cop
getting killed, huh?

01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:58.095
Yeah, I read about it.

01:27:59.340 --> 01:28:01.399
That's too bad.

01:28:03.911 --> 01:28:06.880
I guess you're on that now, huh?

01:28:08.449 --> 01:28:10.474
He must've been a great guy, huh?

01:28:12.186 --> 01:28:14.279
He was all right.

01:28:16.557 --> 01:28:19.651
What do you know
about a bandit named Toredano?

01:28:21.629 --> 01:28:24.621
I never heard of him.

01:28:24.732 --> 01:28:26.723
You read the story, didn't you?

01:28:26.834 --> 01:28:31.601
Yeah, I read it.
I didn't see anything about a-

01:28:31.706 --> 01:28:35.073
Oh, that's the... garage guy, right?

01:28:35.176 --> 01:28:37.804
- Yeah.
- I want you to find out about this guy.

01:28:37.912 --> 01:28:41.404
Now, I wanna know where he goes...

01:28:41.516 --> 01:28:44.212
- who he sees, what he does.
- [Sighs]

01:28:44.319 --> 01:28:46.378
Now, he did some time.

01:28:46.487 --> 01:28:48.785
Maybe he's seeing
the guys he was in with.

01:28:48.890 --> 01:28:52.257
Hey, Buddy, I mean,
how long is this gonna go on, huh?

01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:54.487
You gonna help me?

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:02.728
Yeah, uh- I mean,
I'll see what I can do.

01:29:02.837 --> 01:29:05.237
Now, we had him locked up.

01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:07.570
The D.A.'s springin' him
in the morning.

01:29:07.675 --> 01:29:10.075
Well, he didn't know much,
then, right?

01:29:10.178 --> 01:29:15.343
He knows it all,
including what he doesn't have to tell the D.A.

01:29:17.385 --> 01:29:19.751
But what he's gonna have to tell us-

01:29:19.854 --> 01:29:21.879
That's a whole different story.

01:29:24.726 --> 01:29:26.751
Yeah.

01:29:31.466 --> 01:29:34.196
What is it?

01:29:35.536 --> 01:29:37.561
Buddy, uh-

01:29:40.775 --> 01:29:44.609
Call me in the morning.
All right?

01:29:44.712 --> 01:29:46.907
Take it easy, huh?

01:32:34.282 --> 01:32:36.375

I am working on something
you are gonna love.

01:39:56.490 --> 01:39:59.789
A biggie. I'm gonna need
a little time though.

01:39:59.893 --> 01:40:01.861
- Time?
- Yeah.

Too late?

01:40:10.237 --> 01:40:12.364
For what?

01:40:14.508 --> 01:40:16.442
For you and me.

01:40:19.847 --> 01:40:21.872
What are you talkin' about?

01:40:24.184 --> 01:40:26.209
