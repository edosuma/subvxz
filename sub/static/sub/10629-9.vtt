01:47.858 --> 01:51.779
[Madam Secretary] Kentucky,
you have 53 votes.

01:51.862 --> 01:53.280
How do you cast them?

01:53.363 --> 01:55.115
Madam Secretary,

01:55.198 --> 01:57.743
as a senator for the great
Commonwealth of Kentucky,

01:57.826 --> 02:01.038
I'm proud to speak
on behalf of the delegation's chair.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.915
The Commonwealth of Kentucky,

02:02.998 --> 02:04.917
home of the Derby,
the Wildcats,

02:05.000 --> 02:08.294
and the birthplace of bourbon,
for Vice President of the United States,

02:08.377 --> 02:11.965
<i>casts 13 votes
for Secretary of State Catherine Durant...</i>

02:12.633 --> 02:15.260
<i>11 for Senator Joseph Baker of Nevada,</i>

02:15.343 --> 02:17.680
nine for Governor Randall Smith
of West Virginia,

02:17.763 --> 02:20.307
seven apiece for
Governor Jill Haley of Florida

02:20.390 --> 02:23.018
and Congresswoman Sharon Pierce
of California,

02:23.101 --> 02:27.898
five for one of our own,
the Mayor of Louisville, Jill Carson...

02:28.523 --> 02:32.277
and one vote for
the First Lady of these United States,

02:32.360 --> 02:34.947
Mrs. Claire Underwood.

02:35.030 --> 02:36.489
[crowd cheering]

02:36.573 --> 02:40.577
[Madam Secretary] Louisiana,
you have 61 votes.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.495
How do you cast them?

02:42.579 --> 02:45.290
Isn't this exciting?
You can feel the electricity.

02:45.373 --> 02:47.960
Been a very long time
since an open convention.

02:48.043 --> 02:49.878
I'm surprised you didn't get
a few votes yourself, Senator.

02:49.962 --> 02:52.339
[chuckles] <i>I'm not running</i>
<i>for vice president.</i>

02:52.422 --> 02:54.257
[reporter] <i>Neither is Claire Underwood</i>
<i>and she got one.</i>

02:54.341 --> 02:55.383
<i>That was my vote.</i>

02:55.467 --> 02:57.385
Trying to throw some levity
into the proceedings, sir?

02:57.469 --> 03:00.513
Hell, no! I think she'd make
a terrific vice president.

03:10.941 --> 03:12.776
[crowd cheering]

03:13.693 --> 03:16.529
[woman 1] Mrs. Underwood!
[woman 2] Mrs. Underwood!

03:16.613 --> 03:19.491
[reporter] A couple of questions,
Mrs. Underwood, if you have a moment?

03:19.574 --> 03:20.575
[Claire] Yes, I only have time for a few.

03:20.658 --> 03:22.119
[reporter] Welcome to Atlanta,
Mrs. Underwood.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.328
[Claire] Thank you.

03:23.411 --> 03:24.747
Can you comment
on Senator Sheer's vote?

03:24.830 --> 03:27.707
[chuckles] Well, I am flattered.
But it's all in good fun, I'm sure.

03:27.791 --> 03:30.085
Mrs. Underwood,
he says he'll vote for you again.

03:30.168 --> 03:33.255
Well, I am encouraging everyone,
including Senator Sheer,

03:33.338 --> 03:35.382
to vote for Cathy Durant.

03:35.465 --> 03:37.675
Both the president and I think
she is the best choice in the field.

03:38.635 --> 03:40.262
You changed everything we wrote.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.848
There was no imagination to it.
No rhythm.

03:42.931 --> 03:45.058
We've been writing their speeches
since they took office.

03:45.142 --> 03:46.977
We know what we're doing.

03:47.060 --> 03:50.605
Well, do you want it to be good,
or do you want it to be yours?

03:50.688 --> 03:51.982
[Claire] The vote I'm most excited about

03:52.065 --> 03:56.278
is the victory our background check
legislation got in the House yesterday.

03:56.361 --> 03:59.072
So I'm hoping that the Senate
will follow their lead soon,

03:59.156 --> 04:01.533
and that the president
can sign it into law.

04:01.616 --> 04:03.451
I have to go.
Thank you so much.

04:05.203 --> 04:07.790
Thank you... for inviting us.

04:07.873 --> 04:08.874
No.

04:09.833 --> 04:12.920
It's me who has to thank you and your son.

04:13.003 --> 04:14.129
He saved my life.

04:14.922 --> 04:17.507
No matter how tragic
the circumstances.

04:17.589 --> 04:19.176
[breath shuddering]

04:19.259 --> 04:22.554
I want you to meet
some of the other recipients.

04:22.637 --> 04:26.308
This is James...
who received one of your son's kidneys.

04:26.391 --> 04:27.434
Oh.

04:28.894 --> 04:31.188
And this is Luisa...

04:31.271 --> 04:33.523
who received your son's heart.

04:40.697 --> 04:44.534
Luisa was at the top of the list.
She was hours away from dying.

04:45.994 --> 04:48.288
Uh, if we could,
let's all get together for a photo.

04:48.371 --> 04:50.332
James? Right here.

04:50.415 --> 04:52.542
- You come right here.
- Okay.

04:53.168 --> 04:55.378
[Seth] This way.
Great.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.840
[shutter clicking]

04:57.923 --> 05:00.217
<i>The president isn't shying away
from, uh, his transplant.</i>

05:00.300 --> 05:01.343
<i>Well, I think it's a smart move.</i>

05:01.426 --> 05:03.678
<i>You can't deny it,
so why try to hide it?</i>

05:03.761 --> 05:06.223
<i>Plus, I think it underscores
the importance</i>

05:06.306 --> 05:07.515
<i>of the vice presidential situation.</i>

05:07.599 --> 05:10.185
<i>Wait, rolling out the donor's mom?
That feels a bit exploitative.</i>

05:10.268 --> 05:12.020
[stutters] <i>I... Look, hold on.</i>

05:12.104 --> 05:13.605
<i>A little bit of compassion,
the kid just shot himself.</i>

05:13.688 --> 05:16.066
<i>And with a handgun, no less.</i>

05:16.149 --> 05:18.026
[woman] <i>Legally purchased.</i>
<i>Let's not put this on the gun.</i>

05:18.110 --> 05:21.446
<i>Look, I am sorry, all of this, the whole
thing, the convention... It's theatrics.</i>

05:21.529 --> 05:23.031
[man 1] <i>Hey, look, I...</i>
<i>Bring on the circus.</i>

05:23.115 --> 05:25.075
<i>It's a lot more fun
than some four-day infomercial.</i>

05:25.158 --> 05:27.077
[man 2] <i>Let's talk about</i>
<i>the contenders themselves.</i>

05:27.160 --> 05:28.912
<i>There's almost a dozen of 'em.</i>

05:28.996 --> 05:31.206
- Can you, uh, lower that, please?
- [man 3] <i>...really have a chance.</i>

05:31.289 --> 05:33.416
<i>Durant, first among 'em.</i>

05:33.500 --> 05:35.668
It's 11:00 in the morning, day one,
and they're beating <i>Ellen.</i>

05:35.752 --> 05:37.754
Less traffic on the website, too.

05:37.837 --> 05:39.506
People aren't watching
the videos as much.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.759
This sold over a million copies.

05:42.842 --> 05:44.261
Five times that many read it online.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.304
Yeah, well, that was last month.
This is this month.

05:47.222 --> 05:49.099
We announce a stellar running mate.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.768
He eviscerates Underwood on ICO.

05:51.851 --> 05:55.772
We have not one, but two <i>Vanity Fair</i>
covers that Pollyhop's pushing,

05:55.855 --> 05:58.025
and all you give me is excuses.

05:58.775 --> 06:00.903
The point was for us
to drown out their convention,

06:00.986 --> 06:04.239
not the other way around.
We need to steal the thunder back.

06:04.322 --> 06:06.033
So go where the thunder is.

06:09.327 --> 06:12.664
[Blythe] I've been one heartbeat away
for almost two years.

06:12.747 --> 06:15.375
My heart's not in it anymore.

06:15.458 --> 06:18.921
I'm going to head back
to Vermont after November.

06:19.004 --> 06:20.505
Maybe start teaching again.

06:21.464 --> 06:23.216
Who are you supporting, then?

06:23.300 --> 06:25.177
On the record, Cathy Durant.

06:25.260 --> 06:26.761
And off the record?

06:29.889 --> 06:31.516
I'm not the biggest fan.

06:31.599 --> 06:33.393
Why?

06:33.476 --> 06:36.188
She wasn't much help
during the Russia crisis.

06:36.271 --> 06:40.233
- She closed the deal with Petrov.
- She took credit for it, sure.

06:40.317 --> 06:42.569
But she fought the deal
every step of the way.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.989
Nothing would've happened
if it weren't for Claire.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.615
The First Lady?

06:48.575 --> 06:50.410
The former ambassador.

06:50.994 --> 06:53.705
[Catherine] We're closer in Kansas,
but still not close enough.

06:53.788 --> 06:56.624
Did you speak to Jefferies
when you were there for the House vote?

06:56.708 --> 06:58.335
He's leaning on Fred Simms.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.503
If Simms could deliver
two or three delegates--

07:00.587 --> 07:01.588
That could push Kansas over the edge.

07:01.671 --> 07:02.797
[Doug] I can call Womack.

07:02.880 --> 07:04.091
He's got some friends
over the border.

07:04.174 --> 07:06.176
- What about Pawley?
- Pawley?

07:06.259 --> 07:08.428
Sheriff Pawley in Fort Worth,
old family friend of my dad's.

07:08.511 --> 07:10.847
He's close with some superdelegates
from Dallas.

07:10.931 --> 07:11.974
[LeAnn] Yes, he's on board.

07:12.057 --> 07:13.100
[Catherine] Gotta love those sheriffs.

07:13.183 --> 07:15.352
- That's how we do in Louisiana.
- What about Enright?

07:15.435 --> 07:17.062
I'm meeting him for coffee
at the Hyatt.

07:17.145 --> 07:18.896
In fact, I better get going.
I don't wanna be late.

07:18.981 --> 07:20.815
Now, if we could lock up Virginia--

07:20.898 --> 07:22.192
- It would send a very big message.
- [phone ringing]

07:22.275 --> 07:24.111
[Catherine] And then Kentucky next.

07:24.194 --> 07:26.071
He's got a big old crush on you.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.780
We better get you on a move.

07:27.864 --> 07:30.408
Enright is a stickler for punctuality.

07:30.492 --> 07:33.411
You know, I'm having fun.
I forgot how much I miss being whip.

07:33.495 --> 07:35.830
You whip 'em.
I'll sweet talk 'em.

07:35.913 --> 07:37.332
Nothing like leather
and sugar. [chuckles]

07:37.415 --> 07:38.708
[laughs]

07:38.791 --> 07:39.876
[Doug] Sir?

07:40.918 --> 07:42.170
Senator Sheer.

07:42.254 --> 07:44.881
Senator, you did a fine job.

07:44.965 --> 07:48.260
Yeah, I better get prime time,
not one of these midmorning speeches.

07:48.343 --> 07:52.014
Eight o'clock, Wednesday night.
I called Patti myself.

07:52.973 --> 07:57.144
Do you know the main thing that separates
a politician from the rest of the species?

07:57.227 --> 07:59.854
A politician is the one
who would drown a litter of kittens

07:59.937 --> 08:02.399
for ten minutes of prime time.

08:03.108 --> 08:05.943
Secretary Durant.
Editor in chief, <i>Politico.</i>

08:06.028 --> 08:07.445
It's all right.

08:07.529 --> 08:09.864
Adam, are you covering this yourself?

08:09.947 --> 08:11.866
- First open one since '68.
- [chuckles]

08:11.949 --> 08:14.202
It's humid as hell, though.
I just got here and I'm already soaked.

08:14.286 --> 08:15.453
[chuckles] On the plus side,

08:15.537 --> 08:17.830
I hear they have
the best strip clubs in the country.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.707
- [both chuckle]
- Can I ask you a couple questions?

08:19.791 --> 08:22.002
- Well, I'm in a hurry.
- Just a couple.

08:22.085 --> 08:23.170
Nothing on the record.

08:25.130 --> 08:26.381
Tell me about the rumors

08:26.464 --> 08:28.675
regarding the deal you struck
with Petrov in Brandenburg.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.093
What rumors?

08:30.177 --> 08:32.720
That it was the First Lady
who brokered the deal, not you.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.390
It was a team effort.
Who is your source?

08:36.474 --> 08:38.434
I can't.
You know that.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.312
Well, I'm afraid
that's all the time I've got.

08:40.395 --> 08:41.438
Have a good trip, Adam.

08:45.483 --> 08:48.695
[reporter] <i>The president was on site</i>
<i>this morning for a press briefing</i>

08:48.778 --> 08:51.448
<i>at the Truxton Marquis
with Karen Williams,</i>

08:51.531 --> 08:53.533
<i>the mother of Daniel Williams,</i>

08:53.616 --> 08:55.410
<i>the organ donor
who provided his liver.</i>

08:55.493 --> 08:59.122
<i>Alongside him were all
of the donor organs' recipients.</i>

08:59.206 --> 09:01.958
<i>Ms. Williams took time
to speak with each recipient</i>

09:02.042 --> 09:04.711
<i>whose life was saved
in the wake of her son's passing.</i>

09:04.794 --> 09:06.421
<i>The president used this solemn event</i>

09:06.504 --> 09:09.507
<i>to express his gratitude
for those who share their lives</i>

09:09.591 --> 09:10.883
<i>for the health and welfare of others,</i>

09:10.967 --> 09:14.387
<i>whether through organ donation
or through their work.</i>

09:14.471 --> 09:16.723
<i>The president's condition
has improved dramatically</i>

09:16.806 --> 09:18.391
<i>since his organ donation.</i>

09:18.475 --> 09:22.229
<i>The entire country was on edge
throughout his time in the hospital.</i>

09:22.312 --> 09:23.605
<i>Sixteen-year-old Daniel,</i>

09:23.688 --> 09:25.857
<i>who saved President Underwood
from his health crisis,</i>

09:25.940 --> 09:29.319
<i>left this world by giving back
to so many others</i>

09:29.402 --> 09:31.571
<i>he never expected to touch.</i>

09:31.654 --> 09:35.075
<i>Lasting tributes like this
will not be forgotten.</i>

09:35.158 --> 09:40.037
<i>Currently, there are more
than 122,000 men, women and children</i>

09:40.122 --> 09:42.290
<i>seeking an organ transplant each year,</i>

09:42.374 --> 09:46.294
<i>most common needs being
the kidney, liver, and heart.</i>

09:46.378 --> 09:49.797
<i>And while the number of donors
has increased over the years,</i>

09:49.881 --> 09:53.968
<i>recipients are still in for a long,
potentially fatal waiting period</i>

09:54.051 --> 09:57.139
<i>before a healthy, matching organ
becomes available.</i>

09:57.222 --> 10:00.392
<i>Waiting lists for these types
of transplants</i>

10:00.475 --> 10:02.644
<i>can last from days
to months on end.</i>

10:02.727 --> 10:04.979
<i>Although President Underwood's
critical condition</i>

10:05.062 --> 10:07.023
<i>pushed him to the top of the donor list,</i>

10:07.107 --> 10:10.235
<i>he was fortunate to have received
a donation in time.</i>

10:10.318 --> 10:13.446
<i>Many status one,
or most in-need patients</i>

10:13.530 --> 10:16.741
<i>do not receive a transplant
in time to save their lives.</i>

10:16.824 --> 10:18.451
[continues talking indistinctly]

10:19.161 --> 10:22.289
[Madam Secretary] Tennessee!
You have 77 votes.

10:22.372 --> 10:23.873
How do you cast them?

10:23.956 --> 10:25.708
[woman] From the Volunteer State...

10:25.792 --> 10:27.794
[man on phone] <i>The president will be</i>
<i>with you in a moment.</i>

10:27.877 --> 10:31.673
<i>...we cast 73 votes for vice president
to Secretary Catherine Durant,</i>

10:31.756 --> 10:34.634
<i>and four votes
to Senator Joseph Baker.</i>

10:34.717 --> 10:37.512
- [Frank on phone] <i>Cathy!</i>
- The meeting with Enright went well.

10:37.595 --> 10:41.057
I put a call into him afterwards.
He said you charmed him.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.185
- That puts us where?
- Nine-forty-nine.

10:43.268 --> 10:45.978
We won't make this ballot,
but we're getting close.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.730
Next one.
I'm sure of it.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.357
Let's talk once
we get the final numbers.

10:49.441 --> 10:51.067
Will do. Bye.

10:51.151 --> 10:54.196
<i>- Texas, you have 237 votes.</i>
- Do you have my call list for tonight?

10:54.279 --> 10:55.822
<i>How do you cast them?</i>

10:55.905 --> 10:58.032
<i>Madam Secretary,
my name is Ruiz Trejo.</i>

10:58.115 --> 11:01.411
[Catherine] I see.
Uh, I ran into Giovanni in the elevator.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.120
You can cross him off.

11:04.247 --> 11:05.373
And cross off Milford.

11:05.457 --> 11:08.084
She said she's gonna
back Baker till the bitter end.

11:08.168 --> 11:11.338
<i>We cast all of our votes
to our native daughter,</i>

11:11.421 --> 11:12.422
<i>the First Lady,</i>

11:12.505 --> 11:15.467
<i>and the future Vice President
of the United States of America,</i>

11:15.550 --> 11:17.594
<i>- Claire Underwood.</i>
- [crowd cheering]

11:17.677 --> 11:19.095
[Madam Secretary] <i>Thank you, Texas.</i>
<i>And thank--</i>

11:19.178 --> 11:20.472
[dialing]

11:22.432 --> 11:23.850
[line ringing]

11:25.935 --> 11:28.521
[LeAnn] All 237? Nice.

11:28.605 --> 11:31.316
[Celia] My mother brought
the hammer down on the holdouts.

11:31.399 --> 11:34.611
[chuckles] I just emailed you
my donor lists for Austin and Houston.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.488
Should be at least
two million in the bank.

11:36.571 --> 11:37.655
- Ms. Jones.
- Oh, that's great.

11:37.739 --> 11:39.366
[stutters] Oh, I gotta go.
The cameras are here.

11:40.283 --> 11:43.453
Ms. Jones, the entire state
for the First Lady. Will you comment?

11:43.536 --> 11:46.331
I think our unanimous vote
is all the commentary you need.

11:46.414 --> 11:48.666
Now, the president endorsed your race, uh,

11:48.750 --> 11:50.668
your mother's vacant seat,
uh, during the State of the Union.

11:50.752 --> 11:53.380
He sure did,
and I'm proud to be the front-runner.

11:53.463 --> 11:54.964
Did that endorsement
have anything to do

11:55.047 --> 11:57.091
with your support
of the First Lady?

11:57.174 --> 12:00.136
[Celia] <i>Look, I won't deny that</i>
<i>the Underwoods have been good to me.</i>

12:00.219 --> 12:02.472
<i>But no. They asked me
to vote for Catherine Durant.</i>

12:02.555 --> 12:05.892
<i>And while I think Secretary Durant
would be a wonderful woman for the job,</i>

12:05.975 --> 12:09.437
<i>I think Claire is the best woman
for the job.</i>

12:12.357 --> 12:15.652
Well, I really appreciate it, Diane,
and I know Cathy will as well.

12:16.653 --> 12:18.780
All right, we'll speak soon.

12:20.072 --> 12:21.198
New draft.

12:23.075 --> 12:25.787
LeAnn wanted me
to work in some phrases...

12:25.870 --> 12:27.830
and keyword amplifiers.

12:27.914 --> 12:30.542
[Frank talking on phone] All I'm asking
is that you make the call.

12:30.625 --> 12:32.294
He'll listen if it comes from you.

12:32.377 --> 12:33.378
It seems very clunky.

12:33.461 --> 12:34.712
I agree.

12:35.922 --> 12:38.007
Is there a way to...

12:38.090 --> 12:39.551
put in what she wants and make it...

12:39.634 --> 12:40.718
- more elegant?
- [Frank] He's still pissed

12:40.802 --> 12:43.137
about that limp-dick defense bill
I killed when I was whip...

12:43.220 --> 12:46.474
Maybe...
but I have my limitations.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.852
Well, you don't have much faith
in her analytics, I don't think.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.354
It's paint by numbers.

12:51.438 --> 12:52.564
Yes, well, she also says

12:52.647 --> 12:55.692
that you've been alienating
some of the other speechwriters.

12:55.775 --> 12:58.611
Eh, well, their mediocrity
is what's alienating them.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.572
I'm allergic to it.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.408
- I work better alone.
- [Frank] Let me speak to Bryce

13:03.491 --> 13:05.410
and then see what I can do.

13:05.493 --> 13:08.037
That's right.
WestCAM should do it.

13:08.120 --> 13:11.123
- Uh-huh. Well, tonight if you can.
- [cell phone chiming]

13:11.207 --> 13:12.667
The morning is fine if you can't...

13:12.750 --> 13:15.670
I have to go.
Let's discuss the speech later.

13:15.753 --> 13:16.879
Hmm.

13:16.963 --> 13:21.133
Yeah, all I need is just three more
from your state and we've got it.

13:21.217 --> 13:23.052
Yes, just a... just a few more.

13:23.135 --> 13:24.346
Like, three.

13:24.429 --> 13:27.640
Yes, and so do I.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

13:27.724 --> 13:28.808
Good night.

13:30.560 --> 13:31.936
- Tom.
- Hmm.

13:32.854 --> 13:34.814
I feel like we haven't even
had a chance to say hello

13:34.897 --> 13:36.399
since you came on board.

13:36.483 --> 13:37.484
You're a busy man.

13:37.567 --> 13:39.486
I don't know the opposite.

13:39.569 --> 13:42.029
It has its upsides.
Like sleep.

13:42.947 --> 13:44.574
- And friends.
- [chuckles]

13:45.533 --> 13:46.618
How's the, uh...

13:47.535 --> 13:48.578
Oh...

13:49.787 --> 13:51.288
You know,
if it weren't for the pills,

13:51.373 --> 13:54.459
I could go through entire days
without even thinking about it.

13:55.460 --> 13:57.379
I wonder what that kid would think...

13:57.462 --> 14:00.465
if he knew that part of him
was inside of the president's body.

14:01.383 --> 14:02.884
Tragic, huh?

14:02.967 --> 14:04.594
But, then again,

14:04.677 --> 14:07.597
one man's tragedy
is another man's treasure,

14:07.680 --> 14:09.432
- isn't that right?
- Trash.

14:09.516 --> 14:10.767
What?

14:10.850 --> 14:13.478
"One man's trash."
That's how the saying goes.

14:13.561 --> 14:15.104
Oh, right.

14:15.187 --> 14:17.148
How's the speech coming?

14:18.483 --> 14:19.776
Uh...

14:19.859 --> 14:22.737
Well, this is for the introduction
to your acceptance speech, but...

14:23.863 --> 14:25.448
shouldn't it be
for her own acceptance?

14:27.367 --> 14:29.911
You want Claire to win,
not Durant.

14:29.994 --> 14:32.705
A First Lady as the... [chuckles]
That's ludicrous.

14:34.248 --> 14:35.542
I don't think so.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.251
And I don't think you do either.

14:37.334 --> 14:38.461
Oh...

14:39.712 --> 14:40.755
Maybe I'm wrong.

14:43.090 --> 14:44.801
But if I'm right...

14:47.261 --> 14:51.182
she's gonna need the speech
to end all speeches.

14:51.265 --> 14:52.600
And it would be good
for me to know that.

14:54.018 --> 14:55.269
[cell phone chiming]

14:55.352 --> 14:57.271
I have some more work to do.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.860
Governor! [chuckles]
How are you?

15:02.944 --> 15:04.862
Yeah, well,
I wish I was in Oregon, too,

15:04.946 --> 15:06.030
but I'm here in Atlanta

15:06.113 --> 15:08.450
where it's muggier
than a street hooker's twat.

15:09.659 --> 15:13.663
[Claire] <i>I am honored to be mentioned</i>
<i>with Secretary Durant and Senator Baker.</i>

15:13.746 --> 15:15.665
<i>They're seasoned politicians.</i>

15:15.748 --> 15:16.916
<i>But I already have a job,</i>

15:16.999 --> 15:18.960
First Lady of the United States.

15:19.043 --> 15:21.378
- [all laughing]
- Well, Texas is over 5% of the vote.

15:21.463 --> 15:24.757
And my home state,
so let's not make more of it than it is.

15:24.841 --> 15:25.925
[Catherine] Claire!

15:26.509 --> 15:29.053
Congratulations.
I think you're in fifth place now.

15:29.136 --> 15:30.722
Yeah, with you in first,
where you should be.

15:30.805 --> 15:32.223
[chuckles]

15:32.306 --> 15:35.477
[Gould] Secretary Durant,
do you think the First Lady has a shot?

15:35.560 --> 15:38.480
- I think Texas just gave her one.
- [all laughing]

15:38.563 --> 15:41.190
Kidding aside, do you think
she has the foreign policy experience?

15:41.273 --> 15:43.485
It's beside the point.
And like I said this morning,

15:43.568 --> 15:46.112
I encourage everyone, including Texas,

15:46.195 --> 15:47.655
to vote for Secretary Durant.

15:47.739 --> 15:48.740
- [Catherine chuckles]
- Mrs. Underwood--

15:48.823 --> 15:51.075
You know what, if you'll excuse me,
I want to get back to the phones,

15:51.158 --> 15:52.243
make sure Cathy gets this nomination.

15:52.326 --> 15:53.911
- Thank you.
- May I have a moment?

15:53.995 --> 15:55.455
Oh, of course.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.001
[speaking indistinctly]

16:00.084 --> 16:02.754
Did anyone ask you
about Brandenburg

16:02.837 --> 16:05.172
or any of your people
and your involvement there?

16:05.256 --> 16:06.382
- Brandenburg?
- Hmm.

16:06.466 --> 16:07.509
No, we put that to bed.

16:07.592 --> 16:08.843
That's what I thought,

16:08.926 --> 16:11.220
which is why I was surprised
when Adam Gould told me

16:11.303 --> 16:13.640
that he had sources saying
you deserved all the credit.

16:13.723 --> 16:16.433
We all agreed to what
our version of the story is,

16:16.518 --> 16:18.936
so somebody isn't toeing the line.

16:19.020 --> 16:21.689
Well, I'm sure it's not White House staff.

16:21.773 --> 16:24.191
I bet he's just fishing,
trying to start some rivalry.

16:24.275 --> 16:27.153
Well, I'd be grateful,
if he asks you, or anyone else--

16:27.236 --> 16:30.156
Of course.
And I've been sticking to our story...

16:30.239 --> 16:32.825
which it was you that got
the Russians to back down,

16:32.909 --> 16:34.326
and I was just there to support you.

16:34.410 --> 16:36.037
That wouldn't look good
to the delegates,

16:36.120 --> 16:39.541
the fact that you met
with Petrov without me.

16:39.624 --> 16:41.208
It would look like
I wasn't in command of--

16:41.292 --> 16:44.045
No one needs to know
what we discussed.

16:44.128 --> 16:46.297
You have nothing to worry about, Cathy.
Honestly.

16:48.591 --> 16:50.134
[Frank] Well, yeah.
I can get you on the phone

16:50.217 --> 16:53.596
with the Secretary of Agriculture,
but if you want drought relief,

16:53.680 --> 16:56.015
I'm gonna need more than
just Stevens and Lopez.

16:56.098 --> 16:57.642
Has anything been set up with Baker yet?

16:57.725 --> 16:59.018
Tomorrow morning, in his room.

16:59.101 --> 17:00.436
Well, that's cutting it close.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.980
He's at a big dinner with the Florida
congressional delegation tonight.

17:03.064 --> 17:04.773
Well, all right, and call me back.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.317
The rumors have gotten to Cathy.

17:06.400 --> 17:10.362
Well, we did want them to spread.
That was the idea.

17:10.445 --> 17:12.114
I think one of us needs to speak with her.

17:12.198 --> 17:14.075
Yeah, but the plan was
to wait till it was inevitable.

17:14.157 --> 17:17.036
If we don't involve her sooner than later,
Francis, she could turn on us.

17:17.118 --> 17:19.539
All right, you take
your meeting with Baker.

17:19.622 --> 17:21.540
- I'll talk to Cathy. You set that up.
- Yes, sir.

17:23.209 --> 17:24.417
How much are you going to say?

17:25.252 --> 17:27.421
Just enough to prepare her.

17:29.757 --> 17:30.967
[Seth] Yeah...

17:32.719 --> 17:35.555
[Seth] A lot of calls about
Mrs. Underwood in Russia.

17:35.638 --> 17:36.639
Denying?

17:36.723 --> 17:38.850
Ignoring, which is the same as confirming.

17:38.933 --> 17:40.935
- Good.
- Claire in there?

17:41.018 --> 17:42.687
She's speaking privately
with the president.

17:42.770 --> 17:44.521
Oh, I'm sure she won't mind.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.026
[door closes]

17:54.156 --> 17:55.199
Where are we with LeAnn?

17:55.908 --> 17:57.619
- She's clean.
- No.

17:58.369 --> 17:59.621
I refuse to believe that.

17:59.704 --> 18:03.916
Doug, if our campaign manager
bites the dust, that hurts us.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.752
I gave you a task.

18:08.588 --> 18:09.881
And I'll keep at it.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.636
Nice coverage on the liver thing
this morning.

18:15.386 --> 18:16.763
I emailed you some links.

18:21.058 --> 18:23.978
Boys are older now,
both married.

18:24.061 --> 18:26.313
Got a third grandkid on the way.

18:27.064 --> 18:29.483
We don't get out
to the lake much these days.

18:29.566 --> 18:31.318
Washington takes its toll.

18:31.402 --> 18:32.737
It sure does.

18:32.820 --> 18:35.531
I've made a lot of sacrifices
over the years, Mrs. Underwood.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.449
Time with my boys,
that's a big one.

18:37.533 --> 18:40.995
Who knows if I'll win,
but I'm in the mix.

18:41.078 --> 18:44.999
And I can't sacrifice this opportunity
to pave the way for Cathy Durant.

18:45.082 --> 18:47.334
You won't win, Senator.
We both know that.

18:47.418 --> 18:49.045
But I can't help her.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.005
Now, I realize you two don't get along.

18:51.088 --> 18:52.089
She despises me.

18:52.173 --> 18:53.883
And I have to say,
the feeling is mutual.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.343
- Well, listen--
- The moment she became Secretary of State,

18:56.427 --> 18:59.931
she got the Republicans to remove me
from the Foreign Relations Committee.

19:00.014 --> 19:02.058
And Francis was very upset about that.

19:03.475 --> 19:05.144
But that was the past.

19:05.895 --> 19:07.563
Let's talk about the future.

19:07.647 --> 19:11.483
This support for Claire,
it's caught us both off guard.

19:11.567 --> 19:13.485
But you are my choice for vice president.

19:13.569 --> 19:14.862
Nothing has changed on that front.

19:14.946 --> 19:16.989
Well, my only concern are the rumors.

19:17.073 --> 19:18.449
They could damage my chances.

19:18.532 --> 19:21.118
Yes. And we'll do
what we can to combat those.

19:21.202 --> 19:23.204
That's what Claire said, too,
and it's much appreciated.

19:25.456 --> 19:29.043
But, if, and--
Oh, God, it's a big if.

19:29.126 --> 19:30.419
But what if...

19:30.502 --> 19:32.839
support for Claire picks up steam...

19:32.922 --> 19:34.799
Well, you don't actually
think that will happen?

19:34.882 --> 19:37.927
Oh, no.
I mean, a First Lady as VP?

19:38.010 --> 19:39.053
No.

19:39.136 --> 19:41.889
The party wants someone with experience,
and so does the country.

19:41.973 --> 19:43.349
Absolutely.

19:44.641 --> 19:46.936
But... it is an open convention,

19:47.019 --> 19:50.522
and so we have to operate with the belief
that anything could happen.

19:50.606 --> 19:53.025
I mean, the press
is certainly enjoying imagining it.

19:53.109 --> 19:55.111
Well, sure.
It makes for a good story.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.237
[chuckles]

19:57.154 --> 20:00.491
Yeah, and it's the kind of coverage
that we can't really control.

20:00.574 --> 20:01.617
You know, I mean,

20:01.701 --> 20:04.787
these things have a way
of taking on a life of their own.

20:04.871 --> 20:08.290
Like the Zoe Barnes story did about
my nomination for Secretary of State.

20:08.374 --> 20:09.751
Except that one we planted.

20:09.834 --> 20:12.128
- And this one you didn't.
- No, absolutely not!

20:12.211 --> 20:15.089
I mean, Claire was mortified
by those votes.

20:16.090 --> 20:20.427
What you're saying is if the coverage
influences enough people...

20:20.511 --> 20:22.764
Well, we have to be prepared for that.

20:22.847 --> 20:24.390
I mean...

20:24.473 --> 20:26.308
of course, politically,
it would be a disaster.

20:26.392 --> 20:27.852
Maybe, maybe not.

20:30.730 --> 20:31.939
[stutters] You don't think so?

20:32.023 --> 20:34.525
Well, personally,
I think Claire would do an excellent job.

20:36.861 --> 20:38.863
Well, I am very surprised
to hear you say that.

20:38.946 --> 20:40.031
You don't believe she would?

20:42.241 --> 20:44.869
Well, I've just
never really considered it.

20:46.537 --> 20:48.539
The First Lady?
As vice president?

20:48.622 --> 20:51.167
Well, 251 delegates
think it's a good idea.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.294
Well, most of those were from Texas,
which was a lark.

20:55.129 --> 20:56.130
Was it?

20:58.966 --> 21:00.802
I have as many delegates
as you do, Senator.

21:00.885 --> 21:03.554
- But if you start pushing yours my way...
- You double.

21:03.637 --> 21:04.847
And take the lead.

21:04.931 --> 21:07.433
- And then Cathy puts you over the top.
- That's the idea.

21:08.309 --> 21:09.310
So she's in on this?

21:09.393 --> 21:11.270
She will be.

21:12.729 --> 21:17.318
Well, let's say Claire does take the lead,
however unlikely that may be...

21:17.401 --> 21:19.528
- Very unlikely, I would say.
- Well, let's say she does.

21:19.611 --> 21:20.863
What do you propose?

21:21.823 --> 21:23.032
[sighs]

21:25.076 --> 21:26.577
I honestly don't know.

21:29.163 --> 21:30.372
Well...

21:31.332 --> 21:33.375
Well, you'd have to support her,
wouldn't you?

21:33.459 --> 21:35.044
You... you can't abandon
your own wife.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.588
Uh, true, but I can't abandon you either.

21:37.671 --> 21:40.299
Well, if she took the lead,
I suppose I'd have to support her, too.

21:40.382 --> 21:42.218
No, I would never ask you to do that.

21:42.301 --> 21:45.179
But you don't have to ask.
We're on the same team here.

21:46.180 --> 21:47.639
Well, to be perfectly blunt...

21:47.723 --> 21:49.433
what's in it for me?

21:49.516 --> 21:50.684
What would it take?

21:50.767 --> 21:52.812
You're doing the selling.
Make me an offer.

21:54.021 --> 21:55.022
Let's say Claire gets it.

21:55.106 --> 21:57.191
I assume I stay on,
if you get the general.

21:57.274 --> 21:58.275
Oh, absolutely.

21:58.359 --> 22:01.612
I cannot imagine the next four years
without you being my Secretary of...

22:01.695 --> 22:03.114
...State.

22:05.574 --> 22:06.909
You'd give me Cathy's job?

22:07.952 --> 22:09.411
We're prepared to.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.539
[chuckling]

22:19.088 --> 22:20.672
- Doug.
- Madam Secretary.

22:24.260 --> 22:25.761
We have an issue, sir.

22:26.929 --> 22:29.473
[Brockhart] <i>When I first warned</i>
<i>the president that ICO would grow,</i>

22:29.556 --> 22:31.683
<i>and grow quickly, he did nothing.</i>

22:31.767 --> 22:34.478
Yesterday, the leaders of ICO
sent out this tweet.

22:34.561 --> 22:40.317
<i>"As Suwar is ours.
Soon heads will roll into the Euphrates."</i>

22:40.401 --> 22:42.778
<i>That wasn't just in Arabic,
that was in English,</i>

22:42.861 --> 22:45.739
and sent out in 16 other languages.

22:45.822 --> 22:47.866
They're media savvy,
they're recruiting around the globe.

22:47.950 --> 22:50.327
They have the money
and the manpower now.

22:50.411 --> 22:51.954
Once they get to the Euphrates,

22:52.038 --> 22:54.123
they'll have a choke hold
on northern Syria.

22:54.206 --> 22:58.335
<i>We must act, Mr. President,
and we must act now.</i>

22:59.336 --> 23:02.089
Normally, there's a tradition
of sportsmanship

23:02.173 --> 23:03.715
when it comes to conventions.

23:03.799 --> 23:05.259
One candidate lays low

23:05.342 --> 23:08.387
so the other gets his or her
moment in the spotlight.

23:09.346 --> 23:13.059
But not only is the president ignoring
a great threat to the world's security,

23:13.142 --> 23:17.479
he's insulted the one man
who stood up and spoke out for us all.

23:18.105 --> 23:23.235
When this profile came out about
everything the general just mentioned,

23:23.319 --> 23:26.863
the White House said that
he was politicizing terrorism.

23:27.781 --> 23:29.866
And when I announced
that General Brockhart

23:29.951 --> 23:31.160
was going to be my running mate,

23:31.243 --> 23:34.080
the president's campaign said,
and I quote,

23:34.163 --> 23:38.792
"It's a shame the general
traded in patriotism for careerism."

23:40.127 --> 23:42.964
<i>Now, I don't call that very sportsmanlike.</i>

23:43.047 --> 23:44.715
<i>I call it disgraceful.</i>

23:44.798 --> 23:47.843
<i>How many wars has the president
fought for his country?</i>

23:48.844 --> 23:50.471
<i>I think we all know, none.</i>

23:51.013 --> 23:54.558
And he questions the patriotism
of a man who has fought in many?

23:55.767 --> 23:57.228
You hear me, Mr. President.

23:57.311 --> 24:00.189
<i>I demand that you do
something about ICO.</i>

24:00.272 --> 24:02.899
<i>And I demand that you make
an apology to the general.</i>

24:02.984 --> 24:05.611
<i>And we're not leaving Atlanta
until you've done both.</i>

24:06.528 --> 24:08.405
Live on every network right now.

24:09.615 --> 24:11.033
I gotta hand it to him.

24:11.117 --> 24:12.284
I wonder if this was his idea,

24:12.368 --> 24:14.453
'cause it's almost something
like I would do.

24:15.371 --> 24:18.415
We ignore him. It's 95 degrees.
Let him sweat it out.

24:18.499 --> 24:21.460
I think the longer we ignore him,
the more attention they'll get.

24:21.543 --> 24:22.544
I agree with LeAnn.

24:23.629 --> 24:24.630
So apologize.

24:25.297 --> 24:26.340
It's only pride.

24:27.258 --> 24:29.926
I can do it if you want, sir.
I wrote the statement.

24:30.011 --> 24:31.720
No, it only works
if it comes from Francis.

24:33.555 --> 24:34.598
Claire's right.

24:34.681 --> 24:37.059
And we can do more than just apologize.

24:37.143 --> 24:39.645
I can meet with the bastard.

24:39.728 --> 24:43.774
The issues the governor
and the general raise are important ones.

24:43.857 --> 24:48.695
They transcend party affiliations
and, quite frankly, politics.

24:49.530 --> 24:52.408
And so in that spirit,
I'm inviting the governor

24:52.491 --> 24:54.576
to come here and join me,

24:54.660 --> 24:57.788
so that we can have
a conversation privately because...

24:57.871 --> 25:01.458
whoever becomes the president
is going to have to deal with ICO

25:01.542 --> 25:04.045
and all of the other terrorist threats
that we face around the globe.

25:04.128 --> 25:10.384
So I'm looking forward to hearing whatever
ideas and solutions that they may have...

25:10.467 --> 25:13.845
because a smart president
will steal good ideas from anyone.

25:13.929 --> 25:16.057
- [all laughing]
- Let's kill them with kindness, shall we?

25:23.355 --> 25:24.898
- Governor.
- [Conway] <i>Mr. President.</i>

25:25.816 --> 25:28.735
[Frank] <i>Would you please</i>
<i>put the general on the line?</i>

25:32.198 --> 25:33.199
Sir?

25:33.282 --> 25:35.033
General...

25:35.117 --> 25:38.036
your service to this country
is greatly valued

25:38.120 --> 25:41.623
and your patriotism is without doubt.

25:41.707 --> 25:44.960
And in the heat of the campaign,
well, we went too far.

25:45.043 --> 25:47.421
We issued statements
that we shouldn't have,

25:47.504 --> 25:50.716
and for that I want to apologize,
and I do hope that you will accept it.

25:50.799 --> 25:54.761
Far more important to me than an apology
is eliminating ICO, Mr. President.

25:54.845 --> 25:56.513
I couldn't agree with your more, General.

25:56.597 --> 25:58.932
If you'd be so kind as to put
the governor back on the phone.

26:02.686 --> 26:04.563
I received your invitation, Mr. President.

26:04.646 --> 26:06.523
And will you join us, Governor?

26:06.607 --> 26:09.235
Only if it leads to real action,
not just talk.

26:09.318 --> 26:10.861
<i>I can promise you, Governor,</i>

26:10.944 --> 26:13.780
and the rest of America
that it will not just be talk.

26:13.864 --> 26:16.992
Then, yes. If it truly leads
to securing our freedom.

26:17.493 --> 26:19.495
Thank you very much.
I look forward to seeing you.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.247
- [clamoring]
- Thank you all very much.

26:22.414 --> 26:24.082
[agent] Right this way, Governor.

26:26.793 --> 26:28.212
Do you think this a good idea?

26:28.920 --> 26:30.964
What choice do I have?
He called my bluff.

26:48.023 --> 26:49.065
Welcome, Governor.

26:49.150 --> 26:50.817
Thank you, Mr. President.

26:56.865 --> 26:58.659
I have a room set up for us.

27:04.290 --> 27:05.416
Here.

27:06.667 --> 27:08.252
Have some lunch.

27:08.335 --> 27:11.505
We've got ham,
and I think some turkey.

27:11.588 --> 27:13.632
[Conway] I'm good, but thanks.

27:13.715 --> 27:14.841
Really?

27:14.925 --> 27:17.761
After the stunt you just pulled,
I would've thought you love ham.

27:17.844 --> 27:19.305
[chuckles]

27:22.641 --> 27:23.892
[laughs]

27:25.060 --> 27:26.228
You put this here on purpose.

27:26.312 --> 27:28.272
Well, a little reading material,
you know.

27:28.355 --> 27:30.316
Something to pass the time.

27:30.399 --> 27:32.234
I just got a text from Ben Grant saying

27:32.318 --> 27:35.362
searches for this issue is going
through the roof since we showed up here.

27:37.739 --> 27:39.658
Ben Grant owns Pollyhop...

27:39.741 --> 27:41.202
That's right.

27:41.910 --> 27:44.621
And you own Ben Grant.

27:45.997 --> 27:48.917
Isn't that what power is?
The people you collect?

27:50.043 --> 27:51.962
You really screwed me
with that webcast.

27:52.045 --> 27:54.465
I had everything all planned out.
[inhales sharply]

27:54.548 --> 27:57.718
The Federal Election Commission,
the Department of Justice.

27:57.801 --> 28:01.054
I was looking forward to watching you
go down in flames...

28:01.137 --> 28:02.223
maybe even behind bars.

28:02.806 --> 28:04.975
Well, I'm sorry I ruined your fun.

28:05.058 --> 28:07.269
It's a bit embarrassing,
though, isn't it?

28:07.811 --> 28:11.273
I mean, sharing all your most
intimate moments?

28:11.357 --> 28:12.733
Videos of your children?

28:12.816 --> 28:15.819
I'm proud of my family.
Why would I be embarrassed?

28:15.902 --> 28:19.030
Well, just that you have to stoop so low
to win everyone's love.

28:19.114 --> 28:21.116
It feels a bit desperate, doesn't it?

28:21.199 --> 28:24.620
[chuckles] You're 15 points
behind in every poll.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.663
So, if anyone's desperate,
it should be you.

28:26.747 --> 28:29.375
Well, the key to being president
is not only winning your battles,

28:29.458 --> 28:30.667
it's winning them with dignity.

28:31.793 --> 28:34.838
- Should we talk about ICO?
- Oh, God. Why would we want to do that?

28:34.921 --> 28:36.673
[chuckles]

28:37.758 --> 28:39.760
It's why we're meeting.

28:39.843 --> 28:41.637
Oh, right.

28:41.720 --> 28:44.473
"Real talk, real action."

28:44.556 --> 28:47.142
That's what you're all about, isn't it?

28:47.226 --> 28:50.271
Well, I suppose we could
if you want to, but... [sighs]

28:50.354 --> 28:54.608
then again we could just take
a break from it all and relax a bit.

28:57.236 --> 28:59.530
[chewing] Oh... God.

28:59.613 --> 29:01.114
This turkey tastes like rubber.

29:01.197 --> 29:02.741
Well, it's better than eating a real one.

29:02.824 --> 29:04.243
Hmm?

29:04.326 --> 29:07.538
Oh, I always wear protection when I'm
getting my dick sucked by the Democrats.

29:07.621 --> 29:10.040
- [coughs]
- [both laughing]

29:11.166 --> 29:13.084
- [chokes]
- You okay?

29:14.920 --> 29:16.963
[coughing]
I'm fine. I'm fine.

29:17.047 --> 29:18.382
[inhales sharply]

29:18.465 --> 29:20.008
[mutters]

29:20.091 --> 29:22.553
Don't make me laugh when I'm eating.
I nearly choked to death.

29:22.636 --> 29:24.471
Well, that is one way for me
to become president.

29:24.555 --> 29:25.972
[both laugh]

29:28.725 --> 29:30.143
- Here you go.
- [laughing] Thank you.

29:30.226 --> 29:32.479
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah.

29:32.563 --> 29:34.105
- Hmm.
- [laughs]

29:35.106 --> 29:36.900
[sighs]

29:36.983 --> 29:38.485
Do you mind if I take these off?

29:39.152 --> 29:42.406
They're brand new
and I'm still breaking 'em in.

29:42.489 --> 29:43.824
[grunting]

29:46.452 --> 29:48.203
[thud]

29:48.287 --> 29:49.538
[exhales]

29:49.621 --> 29:51.873
You like to play video games, right?

29:52.791 --> 29:54.460
Now, how did you hear about that?

29:56.002 --> 29:57.003
Tom Yates.

29:57.087 --> 29:59.255
Oh, yes.

29:59.340 --> 30:02.050
Tom Yates. [chuckles]

30:02.133 --> 30:05.512
That's one person you weren't
able to collect, were you?

30:07.013 --> 30:08.474
What did you do to get him back?

30:08.557 --> 30:13.269
Oh, look, I'm sure he was tempted.
He is a fiction writer, after all.

30:13.354 --> 30:15.188
You're a New York Republican.

30:15.271 --> 30:16.773
That's an attractive fiction, isn't it?

30:16.857 --> 30:20.402
And you're a Democrat from South Carolina,
that's even bigger fiction.

30:20.486 --> 30:21.528
Well, there you go.

30:21.612 --> 30:24.573
And I'm a New York Republican,
which is basically a Democrat.

30:25.491 --> 30:28.076
If you were a Democrat,
you'd be unstoppable.

30:28.159 --> 30:29.870
You'd be the new JFK.

30:29.953 --> 30:32.331
[chuckles] And if you were a Republican,
who'd you be? Nixon?

30:33.457 --> 30:35.792
Nixon was a far more effective president.

30:35.876 --> 30:38.879
The only reason people glorify Kennedy
is because he got shot.

30:38.962 --> 30:41.172
Well, you've got that going for you,
too, now, don't you?

30:41.256 --> 30:44.676
And you've got your search engine
and all your little home videos.

30:44.760 --> 30:47.178
See, if people want a piece of you...

30:48.096 --> 30:49.765
you give it to them, right?

30:49.848 --> 30:53.018
[softly] Oh, is that what people want?

30:53.101 --> 30:54.227
A piece of you?

31:02.403 --> 31:03.654
Do you play video games?

31:03.737 --> 31:05.781
No. My kids do.

31:09.493 --> 31:14.080
There's this one game that
my son Charlie, he loves to play.

31:14.164 --> 31:15.874
It's called <i>Agar.io.</i>

31:17.000 --> 31:19.545
I have to admit, I might have played it
a couple of times myself.

31:21.797 --> 31:24.049
[stutters] You start out as a little dot.

31:24.966 --> 31:28.178
And then you go around eating
these other dots and you get bigger.

31:29.179 --> 31:33.016
And the bigger you get, you gotta avoid
getting eaten by the bigger players.

31:33.099 --> 31:35.268
Meanwhile, you're trying to eat
the smaller players.

31:35.351 --> 31:37.813
Hmm. Sounds a little like
running for president.

31:37.896 --> 31:40.231
[chuckles]

31:40.315 --> 31:42.609
So, are you playing with
real people right now?

31:42.693 --> 31:43.819
Yeah. From all over the world.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.573
- Here, you try it.
- Hmm.

31:49.616 --> 31:51.242
- [Frank] Oh, I got eaten.
- Press that.

31:51.326 --> 31:53.829
[Frank] Ah, oh, I see.
It makes you small again.

31:53.912 --> 31:56.540
[Conway] Yeah, you gotta start over
from square one every single time.

31:56.623 --> 31:59.042
[Frank] Oh, God.
I got eaten again.

32:01.462 --> 32:02.838
I wonder what the other players
would think

32:02.921 --> 32:04.631
if they knew who
they were playing against.

32:04.715 --> 32:07.008
Oh, I'm rather enjoying the anonymity.

32:08.218 --> 32:09.302
[reporter] <i>This is unprecedented.</i>

32:09.385 --> 32:11.054
<i>The president and Governor Conway</i>

32:11.137 --> 32:13.098
<i>are meeting right now
at the convention hall.</i>

32:13.181 --> 32:14.975
<i>Two candidates, face to face.</i>

32:15.058 --> 32:16.935
<i>They've been in there
for about ten minutes,</i>

32:17.018 --> 32:19.020
<i>supposedly discussing
the ICO situation.</i>

32:19.104 --> 32:21.314
<i>Now, while the private meeting
between the two candidates</i>

32:21.397 --> 32:23.399
<i>continues behind closed doors,</i>

32:23.484 --> 32:26.737
<i>delegates on the floor are gearing up
for the next round of voting for...</i>

32:26.820 --> 32:28.363
We should head down.
The next ballot is starting soon.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.073
- I'll be down in a minute.
<i>- In the second round of voting</i>

32:30.156 --> 32:31.742
<i>a quarter of the delegates
changed their votes,</i>

32:31.825 --> 32:35.161
<i>support for First Lady Claire Underwood
is picking up steam,</i>

32:35.245 --> 32:37.122
<i>thanks in part to today's breaking story</i>

32:37.205 --> 32:40.751
<i>about Mrs. Underwood's involvement
in the Brandenburg negotiations.</i>

32:40.834 --> 32:43.294
<i>A single vote from Senator Scott Sheer</i>

32:43.378 --> 32:46.006
<i>expanded to support
from the entire Texas delegation.</i>

32:50.761 --> 32:52.763
Oh. You've, uh, got a call.

32:52.846 --> 32:55.891
Yeah, I better take that.
They only call if it's important.

32:57.934 --> 32:59.269
Yeah, this is Will.

33:03.189 --> 33:04.941
Yes, put it through.

33:05.025 --> 33:07.318
- Um, excuse me.
- Sure.

33:12.741 --> 33:13.867
[Conway] Go ahead.

33:26.880 --> 33:28.464
[whispers] Damn!
Nothing.

33:29.049 --> 33:30.926
The fog of war.

33:31.009 --> 33:33.428
A back room within a back room.

33:33.512 --> 33:37.223
Whatever's being plotted in there,
I can tell you it's no good for me.

33:37.307 --> 33:39.685
You know, it's at times like these
I wish I was Nixon,

33:39.768 --> 33:41.812
had every nook and cranny bugged.

33:42.563 --> 33:44.940
- Mr. President?
- [Frank] <i>Your colleague.</i>

33:45.023 --> 33:46.775
How targeted can he get?

33:48.234 --> 33:50.153
We really shouldn't be
discussing this over the phone.

33:50.821 --> 33:52.781
Can he isolate a specific person?

33:54.324 --> 33:56.201
Technically, yes, but--

33:56.284 --> 33:57.368
A conversation?

33:57.953 --> 34:00.706
There are catch mechanisms
in the program to prevent that.

34:00.789 --> 34:04.084
He can override, but it leaves a trail.
He's still figuring out how to mask it.

34:04.167 --> 34:07.378
Our friend from New York.
I want to know what he's saying right now.

34:10.632 --> 34:13.134
Sir, I strongly advise against that.

34:13.217 --> 34:14.803
I also advise that we hang up.

34:14.886 --> 34:16.429
<i>All right, I'm hanging up.</i>

34:22.603 --> 34:24.646
- [knocking]
- Governor, should we head out?

34:24.730 --> 34:26.522
[Conway] Just a moment,
Mr. President.

34:27.815 --> 34:29.150
<i>There's a great deal
of anticipation in Atlanta...</i>

34:29.234 --> 34:30.235
Who was that?

34:30.318 --> 34:32.987
[LeAnn sighs] The president.
He just wanted the latest delegate count.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.697
<i>...and we're minutes away
from the next ballot.</i>

34:34.781 --> 34:37.449
<i>Here's a graphic
of the last round yesterday.</i>

34:37.533 --> 34:40.536
<i>Secretary Catherine Durant
led the way with 22% of delegates.</i>

34:40.621 --> 34:41.955
Doug hates it.

34:42.914 --> 34:44.750
He hates what?

34:45.792 --> 34:48.670
That you have direct access to
the president without going through him.

34:49.963 --> 34:51.380
He wants you gone.

34:52.297 --> 34:53.800
Doug told you that?

34:56.052 --> 34:57.638
He wants me to dig something up on you.

34:59.097 --> 35:01.307
I haven't found anything yet.

35:01.391 --> 35:03.685
And you won't,
because there isn't anything.

35:03.769 --> 35:06.229
I know.
Otherwise, I would've found it by now.

35:08.649 --> 35:09.941
Why are you telling me this?

35:10.025 --> 35:14.195
Because either you're gone or I am,
if I don't deliver.

35:15.822 --> 35:16.990
Unless you give me something.

35:17.073 --> 35:20.535
[reporter] <i>...First Lady Claire Underwood,</i>
<i>a surprising fifth place show...</i>

35:20.619 --> 35:22.954
[stutters] It can be small.
Nothing too damaging.

35:23.955 --> 35:25.666
Just so I have
something to show him.

35:25.749 --> 35:27.292
<i>In my 30 years of covering
presidential politics,</i>

35:27.375 --> 35:29.085
<i>I've never seen anything like it.</i>

35:32.088 --> 35:33.173
Sorry about that.

35:33.256 --> 35:34.758
That's all right.

35:34.841 --> 35:37.928
Shall we go out?
The next ballot is about to start.

35:38.011 --> 35:39.137
You want to watch it together?

35:39.220 --> 35:42.808
It might look better,
the longer we're in here.

35:42.891 --> 35:45.560
Like we grappled
with the future of America.

35:45.644 --> 35:46.561
[Frank chuckles]

35:46.645 --> 35:49.230
Unless you'd rather be
out there with the masses.

35:49.314 --> 35:51.274
Oh, Christ.
The masses.

35:51.357 --> 35:53.234
- I feel the same way.
- [Madam Secretary] <i>We will now commence</i>

35:53.318 --> 35:54.610
<i>the third ballot</i>

35:54.695 --> 35:58.782

vice presidential candidate.</i>

35:58.865 --> 36:01.284
We will start with Alabama.

36:01.367 --> 36:03.036
Madam Secretary,

36:03.119 --> 36:07.708
the great state of Alabama,
for Vice President of the United States,

casts 29 votes
for Secretary Catherine Durant,

36:11.419 --> 36:14.798
<i>26 votes for the First Lady
Claire Underwood,</i>

36:14.881 --> 36:17.884
<i>and our three remaining votes

<i>Alabama's own Jane Winthrop.</i>

36:20.345 --> 36:22.013
Roll Tide!

36:22.097 --> 36:24.224
Alaska, you're next.

36:24.307 --> 36:26.852
Eight votes for Secretary of State Durant,

36:26.935 --> 36:29.855
six votes for Senator Joseph Baker,

36:29.938 --> 36:32.941
four votes for First Lady
Claire Underwood.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.985
[Madam Secretary] <i>California,</i>

36:40.281 --> 36:42.993
Two hundred and thirty-three

<i>152 for Joseph Baker,
91 for Claire Underwood.</i>

36:48.498 --> 36:50.709
[reporter] <i>That's huge for the First Lady.</i>

36:50.792 --> 36:53.336
[reporter 2] <i>That puts her in third,</i>
<i>and she's closing in on second.</i>

36:53.419 --> 36:54.670
Delaware.

36:55.421 --> 36:57.340
Twelve for Durant,

36:57.423 --> 36:59.259
11 for Claire Underwood,

36:59.342 --> 37:01.052
four for Baker.

[Madam Secretary] Hawaii,

37:03.722 --> 37:06.266
Seventeen for the First Lady,

37:06.349 --> 37:10.937
<i>and 14 for Secretary of State
Catherine Durant.</i>

37:11.021 --> 37:12.856
She's got a real shot.

37:12.939 --> 37:14.399
Unbelievable!

37:15.734 --> 37:17.778
Well, not so unbelievable.

37:18.528 --> 37:20.781
Forty-four votes for Catherine Durant,

37:20.864 --> 37:23.909
35 votes for Claire Underwood.

37:23.992 --> 37:25.660
[Madam Secretary] Louisiana,

37:25.744 --> 37:28.038
you have 61 votes.

37:28.121 --> 37:29.998
How do you cast them?

37:30.081 --> 37:31.082
Madam Secretary...

37:31.875 --> 37:37.588
Louisiana casts its 61 votes
for President of the United States

37:37.672 --> 37:41.176
to Secretary of State Catherine Durant.

37:41.927 --> 37:45.764
[Madam Secretary] <i>Louisiana,</i>
<i>I assume you mean vice president.</i>

37:45.847 --> 37:47.390
<i>I mean president.</i>

37:47.473 --> 37:50.852
<i>Madam Secretary,
the state of Louisiana</i>

37:50.936 --> 37:53.229
believes this convention
should be open

37:53.313 --> 37:56.942
for all parts of the ticket,
including president.

37:59.861 --> 38:01.612
[Madam Secretary] Louisiana!

38:02.530 --> 38:03.949
[gavel banging]

38:04.032 --> 38:05.033
Louisiana!

38:05.116 --> 38:09.704
<i>As the convention agreed
to yesterday morning,</i>

38:09.788 --> 38:13.792
<i>we are taking vice presidential
nominations first,</i>

38:13.875 --> 38:18.713
<i>in order for that process
to take place over the full convention.</i>

38:19.881 --> 38:22.592
<i>We have one candidate for president.</i>

38:23.426 --> 38:27.848
<i>Any further discussion
on that balloting will be taken up</i>

38:27.931 --> 38:32.727
<i>after the vice presidential
nomination process is complete.</i>

38:32.811 --> 38:37.899
If you do not cast your votes,
you will forfeit them.

38:37.983 --> 38:41.820
Madam Secretary, we, Louisiana,

38:41.903 --> 38:45.365
<i>cast our 61 votes for vice president,</i>

38:45.448 --> 38:47.826
also for Catherine Durant.

38:47.909 --> 38:49.452
[crowd yelling]

38:51.371 --> 38:52.622
[gavel banging]

38:52.705 --> 38:54.040
[Madam Secretary] Louisiana.

38:54.124 --> 38:56.167
[Catherine] <i>I work for the man.</i>
<i>I'm on his cabinet.</i>

38:56.251 --> 38:57.377
[overlapping clamor]

38:57.460 --> 38:59.295
Would you run against him
if his nomination were in play?

38:59.379 --> 39:01.631
My goal is to run with the president,
not against him.

39:01.714 --> 39:04.300
<i>Look, I love my home state
of Louisiana,</i>

39:04.384 --> 39:06.052
<i>- but they're a live bunch...</i>
- She'd do a good job.

39:06.136 --> 39:07.720
She's a much better
Secretary of State, though.

39:07.803 --> 39:09.680
<i>I'm confident this will all
work itself out.</i>

39:09.764 --> 39:11.432
I've considered keeping her on
after you lose.

39:11.516 --> 39:13.977
[reporter] <i>Have you spoken to</i>
<i>President Underwood about their defection?</i>

39:14.060 --> 39:16.604
[Catherine] <i>Not yet, but I'll be speaking</i>
<i>with him shortly, I imagine.</i>

39:16.687 --> 39:18.314
<i>Hey, this is part of what a...</i>

39:18.398 --> 39:20.233
- Your call.
<i>- ...convention is all about.</i>

39:21.151 --> 39:25.113
I wish I could take credit,
but... but she called me.

39:25.196 --> 39:27.032
Then again,
when opportunity strikes...

39:27.115 --> 39:28.283
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

39:30.076 --> 39:32.120
Definitely not the way
to win with dignity.

39:32.203 --> 39:34.455
[reporter] <i>...Durant commenting</i>
<i>on her home state of Louisiana.</i>

39:34.539 --> 39:35.999
If you win at all.

39:38.376 --> 39:42.213
We should get back out there.
You've got a nomination to fight for.

39:47.135 --> 39:48.887
The president and I, we had a great talk.

39:48.970 --> 39:51.097
We, uh, even watched
the vote together.

39:51.181 --> 39:53.391
But I'm sure you'd rather hear
from him on that than me.

39:53.474 --> 39:54.600
Well, thank you, Governor.

39:54.684 --> 39:59.272
Today has certainly been
full of surprises, hasn't it?

39:59.355 --> 40:03.109
But, then again, Louisiana is the state
that gave us Huey Long after all.

40:03.193 --> 40:05.528
- [crowd chuckles]
- As much as I would like to discuss this,

40:05.611 --> 40:06.988
I have to get on with the business

40:07.072 --> 40:08.698
that the governor and I
have just discussed,

40:08.781 --> 40:12.660
because the business
of the presidency trumps running for it.

40:12.743 --> 40:14.120
- Thank you, Governor.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

40:14.204 --> 40:15.246
Thank you all very much.

40:16.289 --> 40:17.373
[Conway] I'm happy to answer...

40:17.457 --> 40:19.167
I want Cathy in my room, now.

40:19.250 --> 40:20.710
I already called her.
She refuses to meet.

40:20.793 --> 40:22.295
- She what?
- That's what she said,

40:22.378 --> 40:23.671
and then she hung up.

40:23.754 --> 40:25.256
Her staff won't return my calls either.

40:25.340 --> 40:27.550
[crowd cheering]

40:33.431 --> 40:35.850
[Frank] For this to work,
you have to go back to Washington.

40:35.934 --> 40:37.685
[Claire] I can't leave
while you're dealing with this.

40:37.768 --> 40:39.980
[Frank] If you stay, it will look like
you're taking advantage

40:40.063 --> 40:41.106
and campaigning for it.

40:41.189 --> 40:43.649
And the key is to make it
look like you're not.

40:43.733 --> 40:44.775
I'll speak with Cathy.

40:44.859 --> 40:46.444
[Frank] No, look, I've got that covered.

40:46.527 --> 40:48.863
Question is,
how we justify your going.

40:49.905 --> 40:51.116
[sighs]

40:53.159 --> 40:54.202
It's not Washington.

40:55.203 --> 40:56.704
It should be Texas.

40:58.456 --> 41:01.251
- Your mother.
- It worked before.

41:01.876 --> 41:03.628
I'll leave first thing in the morning.

41:05.255 --> 41:06.339
Take Tom with you.

41:06.422 --> 41:08.674
- Tom?
- Oh, he already knows.

41:08.758 --> 41:11.011
- Did you tell him?
- He put it together.

41:12.012 --> 41:14.597
He said,
if you win this thing...

41:14.680 --> 41:17.892
you have to give the speech
of a lifetime, and he's right.

41:17.976 --> 41:20.936
Whatever you say
in that convention hall

41:21.021 --> 41:24.649
will lay the groundwork for how we
sell this to the rest of the country.

41:26.901 --> 41:29.737
And that is why
we brought him back, right?

41:50.175 --> 41:51.384
[sighs]

41:54.929 --> 41:56.889
You can sleep like that?
Sitting up?

41:57.765 --> 41:59.809
I can sleep anywhere.

41:59.892 --> 42:01.269
I'm lucky like that.

42:02.020 --> 42:03.313
[chuckles softly]

42:04.647 --> 42:05.690
We have work to do.

42:07.692 --> 42:09.735
All right, let's work.

42:14.240 --> 42:15.825
This could be better.

42:18.744 --> 42:21.247
Read it for me.
Out loud.

42:24.084 --> 42:26.794
"I've been my husband's partner
in marriage for 29 years."

42:26.877 --> 42:27.920
No.

42:28.963 --> 42:30.298
Slower.

42:30.381 --> 42:32.592
Like you're going to say it
at the convention.

42:36.471 --> 42:38.431
"I've been my husband's
partner in marriage

42:38.514 --> 42:40.391
for 29 years.

42:40.475 --> 42:42.768
Now, it's time for me to be..."

42:47.273 --> 42:48.566
So I can see your face.

42:57.825 --> 43:01.204
"I've been my husband's partner
in marriage for 29 years.

43:02.122 --> 43:06.292
Now, it's time for me to be his partner
in the White House for the next four."

43:08.461 --> 43:09.545
You're right.

43:10.588 --> 43:11.881
We can do better.
