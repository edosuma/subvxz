02:12.090 --> 02:13.300
Damn it!

02:20.807 --> 02:21.767
Rear armor?

02:21.892 --> 02:22.893
Shot to hell.

02:25.020 --> 02:26.020
You better
drop back...

02:26.145 --> 02:28.856
It's the last lap.
We can win this.

02:28.981 --> 02:31.651
Why don't this son
of a bitch just die?

02:32.318 --> 02:33.402
Oil.

02:34.445 --> 02:35.488
Out.

02:37.156 --> 02:38.282
Smoke.

02:39.075 --> 02:40.368
Finished.

02:40.868 --> 02:42.578
Give me the napalm!

02:42.703 --> 02:44.163
Nothing works!

02:48.543 --> 02:50.670
Drop the tombstone.

02:50.795 --> 02:52.754
On my mark. Three,

02:54.673 --> 02:55.757
two,

02:56.842 --> 02:57.801
one.

02:57.926 --> 03:00.095
I got you now,
motherfucker.

03:01.012 --> 03:02.180
Mark!

03:04.724 --> 03:05.851
Shit!

03:07.561 --> 03:08.687
Fuck!

03:10.522 --> 03:13.149
That's how you want
to do it? Okay.

03:26.787 --> 03:29.540
He's still coming.
Our tank is exposed.

03:30.833 --> 03:33.294
He's got us, Frank.
You have to drop back.

03:33.878 --> 03:37.006
It's a quarter mile to
the line. I can make it.

03:41.385 --> 03:43.220
<i>Sayonara, Frankie.</i>

03:44.429 --> 03:45.388
Punch out.

03:45.471 --> 03:46.514
I'm sorry.

05:50.801 --> 05:53.554
Forty years.
Longer than my marriage.

05:54.971 --> 05:57.098
Sounds like you're
gonna miss this place.

05:57.223 --> 06:01.102
I still can't believe they
closed it down. Just like that.

06:02.312 --> 06:04.230
The only thing I'm gonna
miss is my paycheck.

06:04.314 --> 06:07.108
Well, it was honest
work for honest men.

06:07.650 --> 06:10.737
I got a family to feed,
and there's no work out there.

06:10.862 --> 06:13.865
I hear they might be
hiring down at the docks.

06:13.990 --> 06:15.575
Five men, maybe.

06:16.284 --> 06:17.494
Hey, thanks, man.

06:17.619 --> 06:18.745
Thanks, Jensen.

06:32.466 --> 06:34.843
<i>Collect your final paycheck and leave.</i>

06:34.968 --> 06:38.263
<i>The main gate will be
locked in 15 minutes.</i>

06:44.853 --> 06:46.730
Get ready to be
ripped off, boys.

06:46.813 --> 06:50.608
<i>Collect your paycheck and leave
the premises in an orderly manner.</i>

06:50.691 --> 06:53.820
<i>The main gate will be
locked in 15 minutes.</i>

07:02.703 --> 07:03.996
Cash or check?

07:04.121 --> 07:05.915
Better make it cash.

07:07.542 --> 07:08.835
$300.

07:09.710 --> 07:12.338
I worked 120 hours
the last two weeks.

07:12.463 --> 07:14.339
Cash fee. Next!
Cash fee?

07:14.422 --> 07:15.799
You wanted cash,
there's a fee.

07:15.882 --> 07:17.217
You want a check
instead?

07:17.342 --> 07:20.053
Seeing as the company's out
of business, not exactly.

07:20.178 --> 07:23.515
You don't like it, there's
the complaint box. Next!

07:35.485 --> 07:37.195
They never get it.

07:38.446 --> 07:40.406
Self-fulfilling prophecy.

07:59.216 --> 08:01.594
We're honest workers.
We're just like you guys!

08:01.719 --> 08:04.138
What the hell are
you doing here?

08:09.434 --> 08:10.894
You bastards!

08:12.645 --> 08:14.272
Shit! Shit!
Ross!

08:15.440 --> 08:16.399
You okay, Ross?

08:16.524 --> 08:18.568
Rubber bullets,
the assholes!

08:40.839 --> 08:41.965
Come on!

08:42.758 --> 08:44.176
Come on!

09:23.005 --> 09:24.006
Hi, honey.

09:24.131 --> 09:25.340
Hi. Sorry
I'm so late.

09:29.261 --> 09:31.137
Nice day at work?

09:31.221 --> 09:33.348
Yeah. Just fine.

09:37.519 --> 09:39.271
Give me that shirt.

09:41.022 --> 09:43.817
They called the riot
police. It got ugly.

09:44.401 --> 09:46.153
I don't deserve you.

09:48.321 --> 09:49.990
You're a good man,
Jensen Ames.

09:50.115 --> 09:53.534
And it doesn't matter what
anyone else thinks but me.

10:00.082 --> 10:03.252
So, $300. That's
all they gave us.

10:05.045 --> 10:07.464
We'll make it last.
We always do.

10:08.465 --> 10:10.634
I'll start
looking tomorrow.

10:12.052 --> 10:14.263
I think you're forgetting
that I married you

10:14.346 --> 10:16.682
for your
non-financial assets.

10:17.891 --> 10:18.892
Did you now?

10:18.975 --> 10:20.018
Mmm-hmm.

10:44.374 --> 10:48.712
Daddy's home. Is it you
who was making all that noise?

10:49.546 --> 10:52.174
<i>What does little
Piper want? Want a story?</i>

10:53.008 --> 10:55.427
You know you
won't understand it.

10:56.595 --> 10:59.181
<i>But it will be good practice for me.
But it will be good practice for me.</i>

11:07.356 --> 11:08.857
What the hell.

11:10.191 --> 11:12.109
Let's go crazy.

11:24.539 --> 11:26.415
Something smells good.

11:30.628 --> 11:31.754
Honey?

11:32.713 --> 11:33.965
Suzy?

11:49.938 --> 11:53.441
Stay on the ground!
Stay on the ground.

11:53.525 --> 11:56.528
Drop the knife!

11:56.611 --> 11:59.239
Do not resist!
Stay on the ground!

11:59.698 --> 12:00.657
Stay where you are!

12:00.740 --> 12:02.491
Stay on the ground!

12:05.744 --> 12:07.204
Don't move!

13:47.008 --> 13:48.135
Move.

13:59.855 --> 14:01.439
Get up against
the wall.

14:21.250 --> 14:22.418
Scrub yourself.

14:59.704 --> 15:00.663
Stop.

15:02.540 --> 15:04.501
Prisoner will
step back.

15:15.260 --> 15:16.887
Happy holidays.

16:03.932 --> 16:05.142
They slipped.

16:31.834 --> 16:33.085
Good morning.
Morning.

16:33.210 --> 16:34.170
Morning, Warden.

16:34.295 --> 16:35.296
Morning.

16:37.006 --> 16:38.007
Good morning, ma'am.

16:38.090 --> 16:39.592
Good morning.

16:40.676 --> 16:43.512
There goes the baddest ass in the yard.

16:43.596 --> 16:45.723
Sound like you're
in love, homie.

16:46.390 --> 16:47.475
I am.

17:00.111 --> 17:02.572
Damn. I had to
wake up for this?

17:07.076 --> 17:08.411
All right, is it
my imagination,

17:08.494 --> 17:10.329
or is this shit
getting worse?

17:10.413 --> 17:12.248
Like, what is this
supposed to be?

17:12.332 --> 17:13.583
Oatmeal.

17:14.666 --> 17:15.794
I think.

17:15.919 --> 17:17.586
Man, how do you
fuck up oatmeal?

17:21.423 --> 17:23.175
Who's the new guy?

17:23.967 --> 17:25.176
Jensen Ames.

17:25.301 --> 17:26.345
The driver?

17:26.470 --> 17:27.679
Never heard
of him.

17:28.347 --> 17:31.433
Oh, yeah, I saw him race
years ago. He's good.

17:32.142 --> 17:34.311
Did some time
upstate.

17:34.436 --> 17:35.896
Killed his career.

17:36.021 --> 17:39.566
Holder of the fastest laps
at Willard, Union and Butler.

17:40.192 --> 17:43.319
I hope he's as fast off
the track as he is on.

17:59.210 --> 18:00.837
Never a dull day.

18:11.096 --> 18:13.640
Let's get the fuck
out of here.

18:18.854 --> 18:21.314
Heads up.
It's Pachenko.

18:33.243 --> 18:35.286
So you're the
wife killer.

18:36.704 --> 18:39.081
Takes a big man
to kill a woman.

18:43.377 --> 18:45.713
I suppose you
rape kiddies, too.

18:47.256 --> 18:49.258
You hear that,
everyone?

18:49.383 --> 18:52.178
Guy kills women.
Rapes kiddies.

18:54.555 --> 18:57.349
What do you think we
ought to do about that?

19:07.775 --> 19:11.070
Get down on the ground!
Down on the ground! Now!

19:11.738 --> 19:13.239
Nobody move!

19:16.618 --> 19:18.161
Nobody move!

19:22.290 --> 19:25.168
I guess he didn't like
the oatmeal, either.

19:33.592 --> 19:35.010
Well, you've
got stones.

19:36.053 --> 19:38.889
Putting the hurt on
a Brotherhood general.

19:39.515 --> 19:43.185
But right now, that's the
least of your problems.

19:44.269 --> 19:48.565
The warden does bad things to people
that mix it up with the drivers.

19:57.782 --> 20:01.077
Prisoner 77119, ma'am.

20:02.328 --> 20:04.247
Thank you, Mr. Ulrich.

20:05.081 --> 20:07.750
This prison is the
home to murderers,

20:07.834 --> 20:10.461
rapists and violent
offenders of every kind.

20:12.213 --> 20:16.551
The United States penal system
sends me the worst of the worst.

20:16.676 --> 20:18.970
But the men
you've provoked...

20:19.595 --> 20:21.805
Well, let's just
say, Mr. Ames,

20:21.888 --> 20:23.348
that the life term
you joined us for

20:23.431 --> 20:25.976
may be a lot shorter
than you think.

20:26.059 --> 20:28.061
I understand.
Tradition.

20:28.186 --> 20:31.857
Soften up the new guy.
An ass-slapping good time had by all.

20:37.612 --> 20:40.574
Foul language
is an issue

20:41.741 --> 20:43.034
for me.

20:55.129 --> 20:56.422
While looking
over your record,

20:56.547 --> 21:00.092
I couldn't help noticing
your occupational history.

21:00.384 --> 21:03.554
It seems you have some
talent behind the wheel.

21:07.391 --> 21:11.187
Out of curiosity, when was
the last time you raced?

21:11.270 --> 21:14.397
It's been a while.
I lost my license.

21:16.107 --> 21:18.067
What if I could
help you?

21:18.568 --> 21:19.903
Get my license back?

21:22.280 --> 21:24.532
I had something
else in mind.

21:26.868 --> 21:28.787
You're familiar
with the Death Race

21:28.912 --> 21:31.706
and the driver the
fans call Frankenstein?

21:32.540 --> 21:34.584
A man so disfigured
by crashes

21:34.709 --> 21:36.753
that he's forced
to wear a mask.

21:38.129 --> 21:41.089
His return to the track
is highly anticipated,

21:41.215 --> 21:43.342
and therein lies
my problem.

21:43.967 --> 21:46.261
No one knows yet,
but poor Frank died

21:46.345 --> 21:49.598
on an operating table not
long after his last race.

21:50.599 --> 21:52.643
Anyone can
wear the mask.

21:52.768 --> 21:55.395
But not just anyone
can drive the car.

21:59.775 --> 22:00.943
You have the skills I require
to keep the legend alive.

22:03.737 --> 22:06.197
I want you to become
Frankenstein.

22:07.657 --> 22:09.033
No, thanks.

22:10.409 --> 22:11.786
He's dead.

22:12.453 --> 22:14.956
Why don't you just
tell the truth?

22:15.998 --> 22:18.626
The audience wants
to see Frank again.

22:19.585 --> 22:22.713
He moves them.
Inspires them.

22:23.464 --> 22:26.801
And in this world, that's
not so easy to come by.

22:30.346 --> 22:32.889
What makes you
think for a second

22:33.390 --> 22:36.184
I would risk my life
doing this for you?

22:37.727 --> 22:39.396
Win five races,

22:40.147 --> 22:41.648
you go free.

22:42.983 --> 22:44.776
Those are the rules.

22:45.485 --> 22:47.446
And Frank
has won four.

22:48.697 --> 22:50.240
Win one more,

22:51.616 --> 22:53.034
you walk.

22:54.327 --> 22:56.288
Call it intuition,
but...

22:59.748 --> 23:01.542
I don't think you
belong in here

23:01.667 --> 23:04.086
with the rest
of these animals.

23:06.672 --> 23:08.632
I might surprise you.

23:21.353 --> 23:24.522
The race is Friday, and
I need your decision.

23:26.024 --> 23:28.693
Ten seconds from now,
I will retract this offer,

23:28.818 --> 23:34.199
and extend it to Prisoner
68815, James Francis Barlini,

23:34.282 --> 23:36.159
who, clearly not
of your caliber,

23:36.284 --> 23:38.119
will be quite
enthusiastic about it.

23:38.912 --> 23:43.958
And you, unfortunately, will need to
spend your incarceration in solitary.

23:44.709 --> 23:47.962
Since now I know your
dirty little secret.

23:48.254 --> 23:50.339
I'm sure you'll find
solitary preferable

23:50.464 --> 23:54.510
to what Mr. Pachenko and his
friends have in mind for you.

23:55.844 --> 23:59.014
You're a skilled driver.
Your chances are good.

24:00.724 --> 24:03.519
I'm offering you your
freedom, Mr. Ames.

24:05.270 --> 24:08.941
If it's not worth risking
your life for, what is?

24:23.454 --> 24:27.250
All right, turn her up and tighten
the lines! She's hemorrhaging!

24:30.169 --> 24:31.379
Ma'am.

24:31.504 --> 24:34.632
You don't have to call me "ma'am."
You know that.

24:36.008 --> 24:39.011
This is Mr. Ames.
You know why he's here.

24:39.595 --> 24:41.055
Oh, I do now.

24:42.222 --> 24:44.349
The race is less
than a week away.

24:44.432 --> 24:46.726
I have great
confidence in you.

24:48.186 --> 24:51.356
Well, then, I'll leave
you two to get acquainted.

24:55.068 --> 24:58.697
Jensen Garner Ames.
Moved to the States at 24 years old.

24:58.780 --> 25:01.032
Named after a car,
the Jensen Interceptor.

25:01.158 --> 25:03.577
A three-time local
speedway champion.

25:03.702 --> 25:06.997
You've done your homework.
Or do you just know everything?

25:07.080 --> 25:10.082
Jensen Interceptor.
I had one.

25:10.624 --> 25:12.793
Handled like
a school bus.

25:13.752 --> 25:16.714
Call me Coach.
Everyone does.

25:17.590 --> 25:19.258
Gunner. Lists.

25:21.093 --> 25:22.553
This is Frank.

25:23.762 --> 25:25.681
I'll show you around.

25:26.432 --> 25:28.392
We have a fully
functioning auto shop,

25:28.476 --> 25:30.644
just like you'd find
in the outside world.

25:30.769 --> 25:33.105
Each team has
their own shop.

25:33.230 --> 25:35.732
We don't help them.
They don't help us.

25:35.857 --> 25:38.777
To the inmates, you're Jensen Ames,
the new grease monkey.

25:38.860 --> 25:41.154
Nobody will know you're
Frank except us on the team

25:41.279 --> 25:42.238
and a handful
of the guards.

25:42.363 --> 25:43.406
Nobody will talk.

25:43.490 --> 25:44.949
How can you
be so sure?

25:45.074 --> 25:50.246
Hennessey. In here, she is
judge, jury and executioner.

25:50.747 --> 25:54.584
The race is her baby.
Anyone who threatens it, she kills.

25:54.667 --> 25:55.794
<i>The audience for
the race has halved</i>

25:55.877 --> 25:56.920
<i>since Frank's been
out of the game,</i>

25:58.254 --> 25:59.714
<i>and so has the
corporation's profit.</i>

25:59.798 --> 26:01.840
<i>That's why she needs you.</i>

26:03.383 --> 26:05.093
What's back there?

26:06.136 --> 26:08.138
That's a good
question.

26:08.222 --> 26:12.184
Hennessey's had a whole wing of
the prison in isolation for a month.

26:12.309 --> 26:14.144
Working on
something.

26:14.728 --> 26:16.814
Time to meet
the Monster.

26:21.902 --> 26:24.154
Mustang V8 Fastback.

26:24.238 --> 26:27.156
Took the best
and made it better.

26:28.074 --> 26:32.078
That's a V8 Roush 5.4 liter
with a Ford Racing supercharger

26:32.203 --> 26:34.664
putting out 850
horsepower and close to...

26:34.747 --> 26:36.207
Seven hundred
pounds of torque

26:36.332 --> 26:39.460
with sequential
multi-port fuel injection.

26:39.544 --> 26:42.255
Looks like there's
a 250 hp NOS unit.

26:43.506 --> 26:45.007
Just in case.

26:47.718 --> 26:51.639
Then we had some fun customizing
your personal protection package.

26:51.722 --> 26:55.684
Three-quarter inch steel
plate, front and sides.

26:56.393 --> 27:00.397
Bulletproof glass will
be here, here and there.

27:00.522 --> 27:05.986
And in the rear, a six-inch
solid steel shield we call

27:08.238 --> 27:09.823
"the tombstone."

27:11.032 --> 27:15.829
Oil, smoke, and
napalm for defense.

27:16.329 --> 27:20.833
And twin 30-millimeter belt-fed
machine guns for offense.

27:20.958 --> 27:22.334
So where's the ammo?

27:23.669 --> 27:24.462
We get that
on race day.

27:24.587 --> 27:25.671
Pity.

27:25.796 --> 27:28.883
Yeah. Everyone thinks that, first time.

27:29.008 --> 27:30.134
Thinks what?

27:30.259 --> 27:33.596
About turning the guns on
the guards, about escaping.

27:33.721 --> 27:35.931
No, I wasn't
thinking that.

27:36.056 --> 27:37.641
Well, I'm glad,
because

27:37.767 --> 27:39.351
Hennessey has got
electric kill switches

27:39.477 --> 27:41.270
in all the guns
in all the cars.

27:41.395 --> 27:42.897
And all the guard
towers are fortified,

27:43.022 --> 27:44.607
and their guns are
bigger than your guns.

27:44.732 --> 27:46.024
But did I mention
the helicopters,

27:47.942 --> 27:49.819
and also the fact that
we're on an island here

27:49.903 --> 27:51.613
a mile from the
nearest shoreline?

27:51.738 --> 27:53.615
The only way in
or out of here

27:53.740 --> 27:56.117
is on that one skinny
bridge you came in on.

28:09.923 --> 28:11.341
What's that?

28:11.840 --> 28:14.134
Most important
part of the car.

28:26.814 --> 28:28.565
How many people
has Frank killed?

28:28.982 --> 28:35.697
Twenty. The mortality rate
is average 62.2% per race.

28:36.615 --> 28:38.491
So Frank beat the
odds four times.

28:39.742 --> 28:43.037
Yeah. Till they
beat him.

28:58.386 --> 29:00.471
The race takes place in
three stages over three days.

29:00.596 --> 29:01.639
The first two stages,

29:01.764 --> 29:02.765
you just got to try
and get rid of

29:02.849 --> 29:03.849
as much of the competition as you can

29:05.684 --> 29:08.228
while getting your own skinny
ass over the line alive.

29:08.353 --> 29:10.147
Third stage is
where speed counts.

29:10.272 --> 29:12.732
First one over
that line wins.

29:13.942 --> 29:17.320
Tomorrow morning, you
meet your navigator, Case.

29:18.530 --> 29:21.116
She'll help you navigate the
course, reload your weapons

29:21.241 --> 29:23.118
and help with the
running of the car.

29:23.243 --> 29:25.704
I'd like to talk to her ahead
of time, before the race.

29:25.787 --> 29:27.080
Yeah. I'd like
a big-tittie girl

29:27.164 --> 29:28.206
to lick peanut
butter off my toes.

29:28.331 --> 29:29.749
That ain't gonna happen.

29:29.875 --> 29:32.126
It's still a prison,
man. She's a chick.

29:32.251 --> 29:35.129
They get bussed in from the
women's facility upstate.

29:35.254 --> 29:38.090
It's all about ratings,
fast cars, pretty women.

29:38.215 --> 29:41.135
Yeah, Machine Gun Joe is the only
one that has a male navigators.

29:41.260 --> 29:42.428
'Cause he's gay.

29:42.553 --> 29:45.181
Actually, it's 'cause he
goes through them so fast,

29:45.306 --> 29:47.141
the audience
gets squeamish.

29:47.266 --> 29:50.311
Yeah, he goes through them.
Through their ass.

29:50.811 --> 29:55.733
He cuts each kill into his
skin as a souvenir, right here.

29:55.816 --> 29:57.734
What about the rest of the drivers?

29:57.817 --> 29:58.943
Lists?

30:00.153 --> 30:01.529
14K.

30:02.405 --> 30:05.450
<i>First generation Chinese-American,
10th generation Triad.</i>

30:05.575 --> 30:06.826
And his father sent
him to business school.

30:08.328 --> 30:10.663
He's the only man in here
who holds a degree from MIT.

30:10.747 --> 30:12.207
He's killed four
men off the track.

30:12.290 --> 30:13.374
That we know of.

30:13.500 --> 30:14.918
Another seven
on it.

30:16.044 --> 30:18.254
Hector Grimm,
The Grimm Reaper.

30:18.379 --> 30:21.174
<i>The man's a master.
Clinical psychopath.</i>

30:21.257 --> 30:23.092
Believes that Hennessey
is an avatar

30:23.217 --> 30:24.927
of the Hindu goddess
of death, Kali,

30:25.052 --> 30:26.553
and that he is
her messenger.

30:26.637 --> 30:27.721
Cuckoo.

30:27.805 --> 30:30.224
Three time
consecutive life sentences.

30:30.349 --> 30:33.894
He's killed six men off
the track, another 12 on it.

30:35.562 --> 30:36.605
You've already met the local
chapter of the Brotherhood.

30:38.524 --> 30:41.819
<i>Their driver, Pachenko,
has killed nine men< on the track.</i>

30:41.902 --> 30:44.196
Nobody knows
how many off.

30:45.823 --> 30:48.658
Travis Colt,
our local superstar.

30:48.741 --> 30:49.867
Used to race
for NASCAR.

30:49.992 --> 30:51.035
Yeah, he was
good, too.

30:51.160 --> 30:53.329
Until he fell asleep behind
the wheel of his Mercedes

30:53.412 --> 30:56.040
<i>with the help of a bottle of
scotch and a handful of ludes.</i>

30:56.165 --> 30:57.917
Wiped out the entire
patio of La Scala.

30:58.042 --> 30:59.627
Sent a dozen people
to the hospital.

30:59.710 --> 31:01.170
God damn it!

31:01.254 --> 31:03.047
It killed three of them.

31:03.131 --> 31:05.383
Technically the best
driver in here,

31:05.508 --> 31:07.510
but a mean son
of a bitch within.

31:07.593 --> 31:08.845
Ladies.

31:13.433 --> 31:18.019
I hear your man Frank is still in the
infirmary with 15 unhealed fractures.

31:18.937 --> 31:21.231
I also hear he's not
gonna make the race.

31:21.356 --> 31:22.983
You hear a lot.

31:24.693 --> 31:26.445
Who's the new fish?

31:26.570 --> 31:27.737
Grease monkey.

31:28.780 --> 31:31.408
Well, well. Monkey.

31:33.452 --> 31:35.328
I got a new
name for you.

31:35.412 --> 31:36.538
Igor.

31:37.289 --> 31:41.083
'Cause you about the ugliest
motherfucker in this prison, yo.

31:44.253 --> 31:45.629
Funny, huh?

31:50.468 --> 31:52.928
You tell Frank
when you see him.

31:53.012 --> 31:56.265
This race is between me and him.

31:57.641 --> 31:59.935
This time won't
be no infirmary.

32:01.061 --> 32:03.063
It'll be the morgue.

32:03.147 --> 32:05.483
I'll be sure
to pass it on.

32:09.068 --> 32:11.196
Let's get out
of here, man.

32:13.948 --> 32:16.075
Man, that is
one angry homo.

32:26.044 --> 32:27.629
Who are they?

32:27.754 --> 32:28.963
Work detail.

32:29.672 --> 32:32.717
Get to work on the
track for good behavior.

32:32.842 --> 32:34.718
Those are GPS
tracking bracelets.

32:34.843 --> 32:37.721
In case somebody
decides to go for a swim.

33:26.059 --> 33:27.394
The ring.

33:33.692 --> 33:35.694
This was the
old Frank's.

33:37.112 --> 33:39.364
It kind of melted
to his hand.

34:03.471 --> 34:05.264
Frankenstein!

34:05.347 --> 34:08.309
Frankenstein! Frankenstein!

34:08.391 --> 34:14.148
Frankenstein! Frankenstein!
Frankenstein! Frankenstein!

34:38.588 --> 34:39.839
Assholes.

34:46.219 --> 34:47.846
He's all yours.

34:50.224 --> 34:51.641
Don't talk to
the other drivers.

34:51.725 --> 34:54.268
Frank never did.
Part of the mystique.

34:54.393 --> 34:56.396
Let the mask
do the work.

35:12.662 --> 35:14.455
Here comes trouble.

35:42.941 --> 35:44.568
There's our girl.

36:16.807 --> 36:18.184
I'm Case.

36:18.267 --> 36:19.351
Frank.

36:19.477 --> 36:21.771
Funny, you don't
sound like Frank.

36:23.147 --> 36:24.690
Don't sweat it.
I know.

36:24.815 --> 36:27.985
I drove with Frank.
I'll watch your back.

36:28.694 --> 36:31.279
Better than you
watched his, I hope.

36:35.033 --> 36:39.537
Still here. Well, I guess I
got to work a little harder.

36:41.247 --> 36:43.666
Get back to your
car, prisoner.

36:47.462 --> 36:49.881
You sure know how
to make friends.

36:51.216 --> 36:52.926
Case. This is
mirrored glass.

36:53.051 --> 36:56.136
No one can see in, so you
might want to take the mask off.

36:56.220 --> 36:58.597
Unless you like
it under there.

37:00.557 --> 37:03.352
How the hell did he
drive in that thing?

37:08.065 --> 37:09.149
What?

37:09.233 --> 37:12.111
You're better looking
than the last Frank.

37:12.694 --> 37:14.154
A few crashes
should change that.

37:18.700 --> 37:20.327
Start the transmission.

37:20.411 --> 37:22.912
Three, two, one.

37:23.746 --> 37:25.081
And we're live
worldwide.

37:27.500 --> 37:30.002
<i>Welcome to Death Race.</i>

<i>He's the man that

38:27.349 --> 38:29.643
Twelve million hits

38:29.769 --> 38:32.146
He hasn't even
started the engine.

38:32.897 --> 38:35.399
We'll do 45 million
viewers today.

38:40.196 --> 38:42.197
So, what are
you in for?

38:43.031 --> 38:45.075
They say
I killed a cop.

38:46.201 --> 38:47.368
Did you do it?

38:48.161 --> 38:49.245
Yeah.

38:49.954 --> 38:51.247
Bad cop?

38:52.123 --> 38:53.583
Good cop.

38:55.710 --> 38:57.253
Lousy husband.

38:59.380 --> 39:00.882
Frank, Case,
you read me?

39:01.007 --> 39:02.592
<i>We hear you.</i>

39:02.717 --> 39:04.928
<i>This is a three-lap race.</i>

39:05.053 --> 39:07.638
Hennessey doesn't activate
the weapons till lap two.

39:07.721 --> 39:10.599
<i>Now remember, it's first
come,< first served,</i>

39:10.724 --> 39:12.392
<i>so it pays to
be out in front.</i>

39:20.401 --> 39:22.945
This is it. Countdown.

40:41.145 --> 40:43.355
You're sure
he can deliver?

40:58.328 --> 41:00.246
Jog left to 100 feet.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.543
50, 20...

41:07.087 --> 41:08.338
Now!

41:14.511 --> 41:16.846
Punch it! Hard
left up ahead.

41:30.609 --> 41:32.986
He seems to be
handling himself.

41:57.760 --> 41:59.303
Wakey-wakey!

42:26.621 --> 42:28.331
We're being passed.
We've gotta catch up!

42:28.457 --> 42:31.001
Man, I know
what I'm doing!

42:32.210 --> 42:33.295
Hey, just leave
that motherfucker...

42:33.420 --> 42:34.629
Shut up, man!

42:34.713 --> 42:37.089
I know what the
hell I'm doing.

42:38.090 --> 42:39.550
What you gonna do?

42:53.272 --> 42:55.232
You can't go head-to-head
with Joe like this.

42:55.316 --> 42:57.443
He'll tear you apart.

43:00.071 --> 43:01.155
You read me?

43:01.280 --> 43:04.449
Listen to him, before
you get us both killed.

43:04.532 --> 43:05.742
Case, help him
out of there!

43:05.867 --> 43:08.536
There's a shortcut
to the left.

43:08.620 --> 43:09.913
There!

43:15.168 --> 43:16.294
He's taking
the shortcut!

43:16.419 --> 43:18.671
You don't think
I see that?

43:36.563 --> 43:38.816
Activate swords
and shields.

43:43.529 --> 43:45.447
The swords arm
the main guns.

43:45.531 --> 43:47.574
Shields trigger the
napalm, oil and smoke.

43:47.699 --> 43:50.160
I know. I've seen
this race before.

43:51.787 --> 43:54.706
You think you know. It takes
the weight of the entire car.

43:54.831 --> 43:58.501
You have to make contact with
all four tires simultaneously.

43:58.626 --> 44:00.670
Anything else
I'm missing?

44:00.795 --> 44:01.921
Don't get me started.

44:23.108 --> 44:24.526
Activate death heads.

44:26.236 --> 44:28.155
Death heads activated.

44:33.535 --> 44:35.036
Feel it, baby!

44:58.225 --> 45:00.936
Score another one
for the Reaper, baby.

45:03.439 --> 45:04.440
Thank you.

45:04.565 --> 45:06.317
Don't mention it.
Come on. All clear.

45:15.617 --> 45:17.619
<i>Fuck you, puto!
Fuck you!</i>

45:20.371 --> 45:21.790
We got guns.

45:37.013 --> 45:38.807
Look out. Oil.

45:50.150 --> 45:51.151
Damn!

45:51.276 --> 45:52.945
<i>Your mother's a puta,
motherfucker!</i>

45:55.030 --> 45:56.740
What the fuck?

45:59.701 --> 46:01.995
We got to get
back in the race.

46:53.754 --> 46:55.589
I'm the fucking
Reaper, baby.

46:55.672 --> 46:57.174
Can't kill me.

46:57.257 --> 46:58.716
<i>You can burn me.</i>

46:58.841 --> 47:02.970
You can fucking shoot me, but you
just can't motherfucking kill me!

47:12.646 --> 47:15.483
Get that off my window
when we get back.

47:17.777 --> 47:20.696
We're streaming to 46
million viewers, ma'am.

47:37.170 --> 47:39.255
Offensive weapons are up.

47:39.339 --> 47:40.465
It's on.

47:43.176 --> 47:44.719
Fuck.
It's jammed.

47:46.054 --> 47:47.138
Cover me.

48:13.122 --> 48:14.790
Jesus Christ!

48:21.337 --> 48:22.714
Hold tight, Case!

48:26.175 --> 48:27.343
I'm back.

49:07.340 --> 49:08.800
Thank you.
My pleasure.

49:09.508 --> 49:11.135
Shield up ahead!

49:12.344 --> 49:14.013
That son of a bitch!

49:14.138 --> 49:16.557
He just stole
a shield from Colt!

49:17.683 --> 49:19.477
Defense weapons are on.

49:23.731 --> 49:25.232
Let him have it.

49:25.357 --> 49:27.568
The napalm won't fire!

49:27.693 --> 49:28.861
Smoke.

49:31.072 --> 49:33.407
No smoke? No oil?
No napalm?

49:34.992 --> 49:36.409
Again?

49:42.749 --> 49:44.417
Fuck, man.

49:49.005 --> 49:51.091
Remember me, motherfucker?

50:00.308 --> 50:01.601
Coach!

50:01.683 --> 50:04.520
The tombstone won't take
much more of this.

50:05.396 --> 50:08.941
<i>Frank, Case, those 50 caliber
shells will be through the tombstone</i>

50:09.066 --> 50:10.150
<i>in a matter of seconds.</i>

50:10.275 --> 50:12.945
My advice, either
lose him or kill him.

50:19.952 --> 50:21.787
Unhook the napalm.

50:27.459 --> 50:28.459
Get on my lap.

50:28.584 --> 50:29.544
What?

50:29.669 --> 50:30.753
Get on my lap.

50:49.939 --> 50:51.649
What the hell?

50:55.318 --> 50:57.237
Merry Christmas, asshole!

50:57.362 --> 50:58.572
Oh, shit!

51:20.093 --> 51:21.510
Nice work.

51:44.283 --> 51:45.618
Where's he going?

51:45.743 --> 51:48.411
A shortcut. Punch it.
We can beat him.

51:58.963 --> 52:00.423
Look out!

52:16.105 --> 52:20.734
<i>Grimm, Colt and Siad are gone.
Six remaining drivers alive.</i>

52:20.818 --> 52:23.112
<i>Subscribe to Stage 2 now!</i>

52:36.834 --> 52:40.294
We have 14 hours,
gentlemen, so let's get to work.

52:40.378 --> 52:42.130
Starting with this.

52:43.297 --> 52:45.299
So what happened
out there, Case?

52:45.425 --> 52:46.676
He got distracted.

52:46.759 --> 52:48.219
He got distracted?

52:59.063 --> 53:00.189
Coach!

53:00.314 --> 53:01.357
What?

53:01.482 --> 53:04.277
Look at this.
The oil sprayers work fine.

53:05.235 --> 53:07.112
Well, I'll
be damned.

53:16.455 --> 53:17.539
Stop.

53:25.172 --> 53:26.465
Last place.

53:26.923 --> 53:28.175
It's too bad.

53:30.927 --> 53:32.595
Look on the
bright side.

53:35.765 --> 53:37.641
Everyone loves
a comeback.

53:55.159 --> 53:57.161
What can I do for
you, Mr. Ames?

53:57.286 --> 53:58.953
You sure are lucky
a driver like me

53:59.079 --> 54:02.165
just happened to turn up
in your prison when I did.

54:02.290 --> 54:04.250
Oh, I'm more
than lucky.

54:05.085 --> 54:06.795
I'm blessed.

54:06.920 --> 54:08.755
Sometimes it's like
the right hand of God

54:08.838 --> 54:11.091
is sitting on
my shoulder.

54:14.135 --> 54:16.137
I'm not racing tomorrow.

54:17.639 --> 54:19.474
Go fuck yourself.

54:19.557 --> 54:20.767
Wait.

54:22.894 --> 54:24.770
Take his shackles off.

54:38.617 --> 54:40.828
Please excuse us,
Mr. Ulrich.

54:43.914 --> 54:46.166
And take Mr. James
with you.

54:58.594 --> 55:00.972
Do you recognize
these people?

55:01.806 --> 55:04.016
Because your
daughter will.

55:04.100 --> 55:06.102
They're her
new parents.

55:06.811 --> 55:08.521
What's her name?

55:09.188 --> 55:10.356
Piper.

55:11.774 --> 55:14.694
That's the man she'll
grow up calling Daddy.

55:16.528 --> 55:18.947
Unless you do
something about it.

55:20.991 --> 55:22.784
Where is she now?

55:22.868 --> 55:26.288
Oh, I'm sure I have her
address around here somewhere.

55:26.872 --> 55:29.124
You're a smart man,
Mr. Ames.

55:30.625 --> 55:33.170
Play my game, we both go home happy.

55:34.504 --> 55:37.632
The man who killed my
wife is in this prison.

55:39.051 --> 55:42.595
I wonder what he'll say
when I ask him why he did it.

55:42.678 --> 55:46.474
Why don't you look
in a mirror? Ask him.

55:48.142 --> 55:52.146
Poor Piper. It must be hard
growing up with that knowledge.

55:53.105 --> 55:55.733
That your father
killed your mother.

56:16.419 --> 56:18.213
You wanted a monster.

56:19.547 --> 56:21.299
Well, you've got one.

56:41.151 --> 56:42.945
She has your eyes.

56:46.824 --> 56:48.325
Her mother's.

56:49.785 --> 56:52.162
So why don't you wear
a number, Coach?

56:52.246 --> 56:54.415
Because I'm
not a prisoner.

56:54.540 --> 56:58.877
I qualified for parole
three years ago.

57:00.129 --> 57:02.255
Got as far
as the gate.

57:02.380 --> 57:05.925
They got a name for it,
something-or-other syndrome.

57:08.219 --> 57:12.390
The simple fact is, the world's
changed since I've been in here.

57:12.515 --> 57:15.810
Don't know it.
Don't much want to. But this?

57:17.353 --> 57:18.771
This I know.

57:18.896 --> 57:20.481
- What did they send you away for?
- Oh, plenty.

57:22.233 --> 57:23.651
And nothing.

57:24.402 --> 57:27.446
To what do we owe the
pleasure of your company?

57:28.530 --> 57:30.115
I killed my wife.

57:30.407 --> 57:31.533
Bullshit.

57:33.618 --> 57:36.621
You're a hard man, but
you ain't no wife killer.

57:36.747 --> 57:37.831
How do you know?

57:37.956 --> 57:39.416
I've met my share.

57:40.792 --> 57:43.420
But you, the way
you looked at her...

57:44.004 --> 57:47.466
You couldn't do that if
you'd killed her mother. So...

57:50.635 --> 57:52.345
I say bullshit.

57:55.389 --> 57:56.599
Coach.

58:00.603 --> 58:04.065
What would you say if I told
you Hennessey had my wife killed

58:04.190 --> 58:05.149
and me framed for it

58:05.274 --> 58:08.652
so she could bring me in
here to be her Frankenstein?

58:08.736 --> 58:11.322
What would you say
to that bullshit?

58:16.911 --> 58:18.579
Her name was Suzy.

58:23.666 --> 58:24.626
I was always headed
here. Always knew.

58:27.295 --> 58:28.713
She didn't.

58:32.634 --> 58:35.136
She was my chance
at something else.

58:41.059 --> 58:43.687
And that bitch took
her away from me.

58:56.824 --> 59:00.202
"...that thy days may
be long upon the land

59:01.161 --> 59:04.373
"which the Lord thy...
Giveth thee.

59:29.564 --> 59:31.441
"Thou shalt not...

59:34.819 --> 59:36.154
"kill."

59:52.252 --> 59:55.464
You should take a break.
Get some sleep.

59:55.547 --> 59:57.174
I'm okay, Lists.

01:00:01.845 --> 01:00:03.430
Concentration
for the race.

01:00:03.555 --> 01:00:07.266
Concentration, that's what you need.
Gotta get your rest.

01:00:13.189 --> 01:00:14.982
Maybe you're right.

01:00:16.025 --> 01:00:18.402
I will take that
break after all.

01:00:24.116 --> 01:00:25.451
Good call.

01:00:26.494 --> 01:00:28.496
Guy can't grind
for shit.

01:00:54.396 --> 01:00:55.563
Move!

01:01:00.859 --> 01:01:02.444
Looking for me?

01:01:05.781 --> 01:01:07.116
Hold him.

01:01:17.167 --> 01:01:18.919
You killed my wife.

01:01:24.173 --> 01:01:26.050
Well, now, maybe I did.

01:01:28.469 --> 01:01:30.221
I don't care if
the queen bitch

01:01:30.304 --> 01:01:32.765
wants to save you
for the track.

01:01:32.890 --> 01:01:35.852
Nobody disrespects the
Brotherhood and lives.

01:01:37.770 --> 01:01:39.272
Put him down.

01:01:40.857 --> 01:01:43.109
I'm going to
take your head.

01:02:02.669 --> 01:02:04.379
What the fuck!

01:03:00.725 --> 01:03:03.395
Hennessey made me
do it. Ulrich...

01:03:05.355 --> 01:03:06.773
Ulrich too.

01:03:25.249 --> 01:03:26.792
Let me go, man.

01:03:30.838 --> 01:03:32.464
I'll do anything.

01:03:34.048 --> 01:03:36.092
You're going
to die here.

01:03:36.718 --> 01:03:37.969
Fuck you!

01:03:41.347 --> 01:03:43.224
Now, now, boys.

01:03:43.307 --> 01:03:45.810
Let's save that
for the track, huh?

01:04:10.167 --> 01:04:11.668
Coach!

01:04:11.793 --> 01:04:13.211
Take a look at this.

01:04:22.346 --> 01:04:25.140
What the hell were
they building in here?

01:04:28.684 --> 01:04:30.644
We'll find
out soon enough.

01:04:43.783 --> 01:04:45.117
Prisoner!

01:04:48.704 --> 01:04:50.623
It's time to get ready.

01:04:57.170 --> 01:05:00.590
<i>Welcome to the next

<i>Three-time winner
Machine Gun Joe.</i>

01:06:16.288 --> 01:06:17.706
Where is he?

01:06:21.335 --> 01:06:23.128
What are you doing?

01:06:25.881 --> 01:06:27.549
What's he doing?

01:06:31.094 --> 01:06:34.473
He's dropping back.
He's not even trying to race.

01:06:37.225 --> 01:06:38.768
We're gonna have
a little talk.

01:06:38.893 --> 01:06:42.271
We're gonna be done by the
time we leave the tunnel.

01:06:43.105 --> 01:06:45.441
Did you kill
the old Frank?

01:06:45.566 --> 01:06:46.776
What?

01:06:46.901 --> 01:06:48.611
Tunnel comes up fast.

01:06:49.403 --> 01:06:52.406
Remember what happened
to the napalm canister?

01:06:54.909 --> 01:06:57.787
Be a real shame for
that to happen to you.

01:07:02.124 --> 01:07:04.292
Did you kill
the old Frank?

01:07:06.836 --> 01:07:08.797
I sabotaged his
rear weapons.

01:07:08.922 --> 01:07:10.006
Why?

01:07:11.508 --> 01:07:12.592
Hennessey.

01:07:12.676 --> 01:07:16.346
She said she'd sign my release
papers. It's my life back.

01:07:16.888 --> 01:07:18.139
I'd have killed
him, too.

01:07:18.264 --> 01:07:19.641
I didn't kill him!

01:07:19.766 --> 01:07:22.769
He wouldn't quit. I just wanted
to make sure he didn't win.

01:07:22.852 --> 01:07:24.604
Why would Hennessey
want that?

01:07:24.688 --> 01:07:27.190
To keep Frank
here, racing.

01:07:29.693 --> 01:07:31.151
And yesterday?

01:07:31.235 --> 01:07:32.653
She wanted me
to set you back.

01:07:32.736 --> 01:07:35.489
So I'm not supposed
to win, either.

01:07:35.572 --> 01:07:38.075
Just make it exciting.

01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:46.709
That's all
I wanted to know.

01:07:49.336 --> 01:07:50.713
Hold tight.

01:08:07.603 --> 01:08:10.064
Come on!
Just come on through!

01:08:31.501 --> 01:08:32.711
Damn!

01:08:39.968 --> 01:08:42.011
He's going
after Pachenko.

01:09:18.212 --> 01:09:20.840
Sword and shield
ahead. Take defense.

01:09:21.508 --> 01:09:22.716
No.

01:09:25.095 --> 01:09:27.430
There's someone
I need to kill.

01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:30.725
You're out in front.

01:09:30.850 --> 01:09:32.394
Who are you going
to shoot at?

01:09:34.187 --> 01:09:36.022
You're a dead man!

01:09:41.443 --> 01:09:43.654
I told you to
take defense!

01:09:58.544 --> 01:10:00.629
He's too heavily
armored!

01:10:06.093 --> 01:10:07.301
Fuck!

01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:10.847
Hit the smoke.

01:11:00.478 --> 01:11:03.147
This is a race.
You don't go backwards.

01:11:13.074 --> 01:11:15.660
And you don't get
out of the car.

01:11:27.629 --> 01:11:30.006
It was Hennessey.
Hennessey.

01:11:30.131 --> 01:11:32.676
I know. She's next.

01:11:46.523 --> 01:11:49.234
I got it. Frank's
out of his car.

01:11:49.359 --> 01:11:50.694
What?

01:11:50.777 --> 01:11:52.069
He stepped out
of his car.

01:11:52.194 --> 01:11:54.029
Okay. I see him.
I need guns.

01:11:54.154 --> 01:11:56.657
Yes. Sword coming
up in 50 yards.

01:12:00.661 --> 01:12:02.037
What happened?
I don't know.

01:12:02.121 --> 01:12:03.664
Somebody must
have grabbed it.

01:12:03.747 --> 01:12:05.207
What do you mean,
somebody grabbed it?

01:12:05.290 --> 01:12:08.002
Look, man.
I thought it was lit.

01:12:08.127 --> 01:12:10.004
What do you mean,
you thought?

01:12:10.087 --> 01:12:11.922
Man, get the fuck
out of my car.

01:12:12.047 --> 01:12:13.173
What?

01:12:13.257 --> 01:12:15.843
I said, get the fuck
out of my car!

01:12:32.692 --> 01:12:34.110
Oh, hell, no!
Come on, man.

01:12:34.235 --> 01:12:36.821
Listen, we got...
Wait! Wait! Wait!

01:12:36.946 --> 01:12:39.407
Wait! Wait! It ain't my turn!
It's not what I do.

01:12:39.532 --> 01:12:40.950
Get in there.

01:12:43.286 --> 01:12:45.245
Don't let me
down, boy.

01:12:59.676 --> 01:13:01.636
Release the Dreadnought.

01:13:11.604 --> 01:13:12.897
Coach?

01:13:22.156 --> 01:13:23.240
Oh.

01:13:23.324 --> 01:13:26.410
Well, I guess we know
what she was building now.

01:13:34.335 --> 01:13:36.003
Activate weapons.

01:13:50.141 --> 01:13:51.601
Jesus Christ!

01:14:27.261 --> 01:14:28.595
Coach, any ideas?

01:14:28.679 --> 01:14:30.179
You just have to
tough it out, I guess.

01:14:30.263 --> 01:14:34.142
Hennessey will take it off after
she's pumped up the ratings.

01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:39.105
You sure
about that?

01:14:58.290 --> 01:14:59.958
Where the hell is
that thing going?

01:16:05.563 --> 01:16:06.898
Fuck me.

01:16:21.245 --> 01:16:22.579
<i>Lists.</i>

01:16:23.414 --> 01:16:24.373
Receiving.

01:16:24.456 --> 01:16:26.583
I want you to patch me
through to another car.

01:16:26.667 --> 01:16:27.876
On it.

01:16:33.882 --> 01:16:35.092
<i>Joe?</i>

01:16:36.093 --> 01:16:37.219
Who is this?

01:16:37.344 --> 01:16:39.179
It's Frank.
What do you want?

01:16:39.305 --> 01:16:41.764
How about we play
a little offense?

01:16:44.726 --> 01:16:46.602
I hope you know
what you're doing.

01:18:07.597 --> 01:18:09.641
Now that's entertainment!

01:18:10.684 --> 01:18:11.893
Damn it!

01:18:19.818 --> 01:18:23.947
Frankenstein!
Frankenstein! Frankenstein!

01:18:24.072 --> 01:18:27.574
Frankenstein! Frankenstein!

01:18:28.033 --> 01:18:29.952
Frankenstein! Frankenstein!

01:18:43.299 --> 01:18:45.342
Nice reflexes
there, Igor.

01:18:48.137 --> 01:18:49.930
Race car reflexes.

01:18:51.764 --> 01:18:53.474
You look lost, pal.

01:18:54.058 --> 01:18:55.601
Not this time.

01:18:57.270 --> 01:19:00.690
I got this feeling that
you and Frank are close.

01:19:02.108 --> 01:19:03.651
Real close.

01:19:03.776 --> 01:19:07.280
That weird accent.
You even kind of sound alike.

01:19:08.406 --> 01:19:11.951
I was wondering, what
if you got in a accident?

01:19:13.828 --> 01:19:16.956
Would that throw Frank
off his game a little bit?

01:19:17.497 --> 01:19:18.915
I doubt it,

01:19:19.333 --> 01:19:21.668
sick, fucked-up
guy that he is.

01:19:23.045 --> 01:19:25.422
He might just
want to kill you.

01:19:28.342 --> 01:19:29.801
That's cool.

01:19:31.553 --> 01:19:33.972
So I guess I'll
see him later.

01:19:35.057 --> 01:19:36.308
Right?

01:19:39.645 --> 01:19:41.063
Let's roll.

01:20:00.623 --> 01:20:04.251
Ma'am, with all respect,
what are we going to do?

01:20:04.377 --> 01:20:07.046
We're going to kill
him, of course.

01:20:07.171 --> 01:20:08.756
You want me to
kill Frankenstein?

01:20:08.881 --> 01:20:10.382
Don't be stupid.

01:20:10.507 --> 01:20:12.676
Frankenstein
can't die.

01:20:12.801 --> 01:20:14.970
After all,
he's just a mask.

01:20:42.746 --> 01:20:46.125
Tonight is the
final leg of the Death Race,

01:20:46.208 --> 01:20:49.712
and perhaps a new
champion will arise.

01:20:50.296 --> 01:20:52.089
A five times winner.

01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:56.677
The first man ever
to gain his freedom.

01:20:58.470 --> 01:21:02.682
The world gave you to me because
you were not fit to be a part of it.

01:21:03.266 --> 01:21:05.643
You were not fit
to be husbands,

01:21:06.644 --> 01:21:08.938
you were not fit
to be fathers,

01:21:10.148 --> 01:21:14.068
and were too dangerous to
live with the rest of us.

01:21:14.986 --> 01:21:16.946
What is this
shit, man?

01:21:17.739 --> 01:21:20.199
But when you race tonight,

01:21:20.325 --> 01:21:23.578
know that the eyes of
the world are upon you.

01:21:50.228 --> 01:21:54.107
And know that the very same
world which rejected you

01:21:54.191 --> 01:21:57.068
now lives and
breathes with you.

01:21:57.943 --> 01:22:01.697
And it draws inspiration
from your courage.

01:22:02.573 --> 01:22:04.533
No one is ever gonna
win five races.

01:22:04.617 --> 01:22:06.827
So race well...

01:22:06.911 --> 01:22:08.663
Nobody is ever
getting out of here.

01:22:08.746 --> 01:22:12.458
...and know that I
consider you all my heroes.

01:22:24.844 --> 01:22:27.055
I want to show
you something.

01:22:29.099 --> 01:22:32.560
<i>Can't kill me.
Can't kill me. I'm the fucking Reaper.</i>

01:22:36.648 --> 01:22:38.400
<i>You can burn me.</i>

01:22:39.025 --> 01:22:42.237
<i>You can shoot me.
But you can't motherfucking...</i>

01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:43.530
There.

01:22:58.961 --> 01:23:00.462
Gunner, Lists.

01:23:01.088 --> 01:23:02.548
Will Hennessey's
inspectors care

01:23:02.631 --> 01:23:04.758
if we had a half
gallon reserve tank?

01:23:04.842 --> 01:23:06.468
Another half gallon?

01:23:06.593 --> 01:23:09.013
You got a fuel tank
that holds 35 gallons.

01:23:09.138 --> 01:23:11.974
What the hell you want
another half gallon for?

01:23:12.099 --> 01:23:13.683
Coach?

01:23:13.808 --> 01:23:16.227
Let's give the man
what he wants.

01:23:19.272 --> 01:23:21.232
Hey, where are
you going?

01:23:28.323 --> 01:23:30.366
Oh, this is
not good.

01:23:45.172 --> 01:23:47.382
Real brave,
coming over here.

01:23:53.305 --> 01:23:57.267
I'm going to win this race,
'cause I want out of this shithole.

01:23:58.268 --> 01:24:00.687
I've already won
three races.

01:24:00.771 --> 01:24:04.524
Two more, and I'm
smoking Cohibas in Miami.

01:24:08.402 --> 01:24:11.197
Frank might want
to think about that.

01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:13.115
'Cause I'm gone.

01:24:13.824 --> 01:24:15.201
Out of here.

01:24:16.577 --> 01:24:18.537
Then maybe
it's his turn.

01:24:18.621 --> 01:24:21.666
Maybe he's thinking it's
the other way around.

01:24:26.379 --> 01:24:29.882
From here on out, you stay
the fuck out of my pit.

01:24:39.265 --> 01:24:40.350
Hey.

01:24:43.144 --> 01:24:46.231
Thinking you and Frank
should have a little talk.

01:24:50.026 --> 01:24:54.155
<i>Welcome to the final
installment of Death Race.</i>

01:24:54.948 --> 01:24:56.408
<i>Seven men dead.</i>

01:24:56.533 --> 01:24:57.826
<i>Siad,</i>

01:24:57.951 --> 01:24:59.451
<i>Grimm,</i>

01:24:59.576 --> 01:25:01.370
<i>Colt, Pachenko,</i>

01:25:02.079 --> 01:25:03.289
<i>Carson,</i>

01:25:03.414 --> 01:25:04.456
<i>Riggins</i>

01:25:04.581 --> 01:25:07.793
<i>and 14K are all dead.</i>

01:25:07.876 --> 01:25:11.213
<i>Just Frankenstein and
Machine Gun Joe survive.</i>

01:25:11.297 --> 01:25:13.716
<i>Frank, racing for
his freedom.</i>

01:25:13.799 --> 01:25:16.802
<i>Joe, doing anything
to stop him.</i>

01:25:16.885 --> 01:25:20.222
<i>It's mano y mano,
and there will be no mercy.</i>

01:25:20.347 --> 01:25:24.143
<i>Tonight, only one man will
walk off this track alive.</i>

01:25:24.268 --> 01:25:27.895
<i>A record 70 million are
already watching. Join them.</i>

01:25:27.979 --> 01:25:30.607
<i>Subscribe to the
final stage now.</i>

01:25:34.569 --> 01:25:36.404
It's an honor to navigate for you, sir.

01:25:36.487 --> 01:25:38.156
They call me...
Save it.

01:25:38.239 --> 01:25:40.908
We won't have time
to get acquainted.

01:25:43.661 --> 01:25:45.622
What the
hell are those?

01:25:46.247 --> 01:25:49.000
Model 7 Russian
states armory RPG's.

01:25:50.043 --> 01:25:53.337
Armor-piercing, self-arming,
accurate to 1,000 yards.

01:25:54.755 --> 01:25:56.715
That's what
I thought.

01:26:02.429 --> 01:26:04.389
Prisoner, step back.

01:26:14.983 --> 01:26:18.277
I thought maybe you could
use a little inspiration.

01:26:19.737 --> 01:26:21.530
Your release papers.

01:26:22.323 --> 01:26:24.450
They're already
signed.

01:26:24.575 --> 01:26:27.828
All you have to do is
walk off that track alive.

01:26:27.912 --> 01:26:30.623
Well, and win,
of course.

01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:41.592
But if you do win,

01:26:41.717 --> 01:26:44.427
I want you to think
about staying here.

01:26:45.136 --> 01:26:46.763
As Frankenstein.

01:26:47.806 --> 01:26:49.265
With me.

01:26:49.766 --> 01:26:50.934
Yeah.

01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:54.396
I can see the appeal.

01:26:55.730 --> 01:26:58.441
What would you do
with your freedom?

01:26:59.234 --> 01:27:00.902
Go back to
your daughter?

01:27:01.027 --> 01:27:02.404
That's the idea.

01:27:03.321 --> 01:27:04.823
The thing is,

01:27:04.906 --> 01:27:07.951
are you really the best
future she could possibly have?

01:27:09.952 --> 01:27:12.121
Are you really
daddy material?

01:27:12.204 --> 01:27:14.290
Or deep down, are
you something else?

01:27:20.212 --> 01:27:24.300
If you decided that out there on
that track is where you belong,

01:27:24.383 --> 01:27:29.305
it would be the most unselfish
act of love I've ever seen.

01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:37.812
Just something
to think about.

01:28:17.434 --> 01:28:18.936
What's this?

01:28:19.061 --> 01:28:20.771
Small modification.

01:28:22.064 --> 01:28:26.151
So Hennessey tells me if you're going
to win, I'm supposed to stop you.

01:28:26.276 --> 01:28:27.944
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

01:28:29.946 --> 01:28:32.698
Sounds like the odds
are stacked against us.

01:28:32.782 --> 01:28:34.784
Then do what
you do best.

01:28:37.078 --> 01:28:38.287
Drive.

01:28:49.465 --> 01:28:52.677
Gentlemen, this should be interesting.

01:29:17.075 --> 01:29:18.576
Lit sword up ahead.

01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:20.536
Deactivate that.
Sir?

01:29:20.661 --> 01:29:22.121
Just do it.

01:29:23.539 --> 01:29:25.249
Switch it back on.

01:29:25.833 --> 01:29:27.501
Weapons are up!

01:29:27.918 --> 01:29:28.877
Damn it!

01:29:39.638 --> 01:29:40.723
Shit.

01:29:42.516 --> 01:29:44.143
Lit shield up ahead!

01:29:48.271 --> 01:29:49.272
Damn it!

01:29:49.355 --> 01:29:50.356
What happened?

01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:52.358
Hennessey must have
deactivated it. Bitch!

01:29:59.532 --> 01:30:00.867
Light me up.

01:30:07.707 --> 01:30:09.334
It's party time.

01:30:39.862 --> 01:30:42.073
Coach, we gotta
get the firepower.

01:30:42.198 --> 01:30:43.950
Nothing lit
for a half lap.

01:30:44.075 --> 01:30:46.118
We won't last that long!

01:31:23.905 --> 01:31:25.490
Drop the tombstone.

01:31:25.615 --> 01:31:26.658
What?

01:31:26.992 --> 01:31:28.118
Do it!

01:31:32.121 --> 01:31:34.164
On my mark. Three,

01:31:36.709 --> 01:31:37.793
two,

01:31:39.044 --> 01:31:40.129
one!

01:31:42.214 --> 01:31:43.340
Mark.

01:31:47.052 --> 01:31:48.345
Damn it!

01:31:49.555 --> 01:31:52.057
That shit don't
work twice, playboy!

01:31:59.188 --> 01:32:00.398
Shit.

01:32:00.523 --> 01:32:02.483
Lit shield in
quarter lap.

01:32:02.567 --> 01:32:04.485
Do you hear that?
Lit shield in the quarter lap.

01:32:20.126 --> 01:32:21.878
He's coming up fast.

01:32:23.087 --> 01:32:26.924
Let them get the shield.
Keep the viewers interested.

01:32:36.433 --> 01:32:38.936
Son of a bitch!
He got the shield!

01:32:44.900 --> 01:32:46.526
Arm the explosive.

01:32:47.319 --> 01:32:48.820
Just in case.

01:32:55.284 --> 01:32:56.535
Yo, Frankenfreak.

01:32:56.619 --> 01:32:58.371
This villager's
got a pitchfork,

01:32:58.454 --> 01:33:00.748
and it's headed
straight up your ass.

01:33:27.190 --> 01:33:29.025
What just happened?

01:33:34.990 --> 01:33:37.826
Yeah! Yeah, Frank!

01:33:39.619 --> 01:33:42.496
They're off the track.
They're escaping.

01:33:42.579 --> 01:33:44.039
They're headed
for the bridge.

01:33:44.164 --> 01:33:46.709
Their weapons.
Hit the kill switches.

01:33:49.420 --> 01:33:52.715
Seventy million viewers,
ma'am. They're all watching.

01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:53.841
Shut the webcast down.

01:33:53.966 --> 01:33:55.009
Shut it down!

01:33:55.092 --> 01:33:57.177
Shut the fucking
computers down now!

01:34:01.557 --> 01:34:03.225
Get out! Get out!
Get out! Now!

01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:04.560
Get out! Get out!

01:34:04.685 --> 01:34:05.811
Get out! Get out!

01:34:11.357 --> 01:34:13.192
Yo, Frankenstein.

01:34:13.318 --> 01:34:15.236
<i>It's good we had
that little talk.</i>

01:34:18.448 --> 01:34:21.034
We gave that bitch
a good show, huh?

01:34:27.290 --> 01:34:28.791
Give me that!

01:34:29.250 --> 01:34:32.795
Okay, cocksucker,
fuck with me,

01:34:32.921 --> 01:34:34.880
and we'll see who
shits on the sidewalk.

01:34:39.134 --> 01:34:40.969
Somebody's mad
right now.

01:34:41.094 --> 01:34:43.305
Nobody fucks
with my car.

01:34:45.515 --> 01:34:46.892
Son of a bitch!

01:34:46.975 --> 01:34:48.226
Get the choppers
in the air!

01:34:48.810 --> 01:34:51.438
Come on. Off the ground. Go, go, go!

01:35:09.997 --> 01:35:11.540
So what's your
real name?

01:35:11.624 --> 01:35:13.709
I don't have the
time for small talk.

01:35:13.834 --> 01:35:16.254
Just want to know
who I'm riding with.

01:35:19.674 --> 01:35:22.176
Jensen Ames.

01:35:23.844 --> 01:35:25.638
Like...
Like the car.

01:35:25.763 --> 01:35:26.847
Like the car.

01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:31.559
Well, Jensen Ames,
I hope you got a plan,

01:35:31.726 --> 01:35:33.812
'cause it's not like we're
going to get very far.

01:35:33.895 --> 01:35:35.105
You're right.

01:35:35.772 --> 01:35:36.731
We won't.

01:35:45.907 --> 01:35:47.993
Now would be
a good time.

01:36:08.470 --> 01:36:10.347
Very nice modification.

01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:15.144
<i>That extra half
gallon reserve tank</i>

01:36:15.269 --> 01:36:17.271
<i>should see you through
to the finish.</i>

01:36:17.896 --> 01:36:20.481
<i>Bon voyage, Frank.</i>

01:36:52.804 --> 01:36:54.723
Choppers have
a visual, ma'am.

01:37:07.235 --> 01:37:08.862
Good luck, Joe.

01:37:25.544 --> 01:37:28.881
Get me a pilot.
I need to talk to a pilot right now.

01:37:29.340 --> 01:37:30.466
Okay. You're on.

01:37:30.549 --> 01:37:32.009
Stay with Frankenstein!
Don't lose him.

01:37:40.850 --> 01:37:42.269
Sure you're
up for this?

01:37:42.352 --> 01:37:43.395
I'm sure.

01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:44.813
I owe it to Frank.

01:37:44.938 --> 01:37:47.607
Besides, Hennessey already
gave me my release papers.

01:37:47.732 --> 01:37:49.859
They have to let me out.

01:39:00.594 --> 01:39:02.763
They've stopped
him, ma'am.

01:39:36.087 --> 01:39:38.339
<i>Keep your hands
where we can see them.</i>

01:39:38.422 --> 01:39:40.549
<i>You are under arrest!</i>

01:39:40.633 --> 01:39:44.387
<i>I repeat, keep your hands
where we can see them!</i>

01:39:44.512 --> 01:39:46.430
<i>You are under arrest!</i>

01:39:51.977 --> 01:39:54.813
Hey, Igor.
Merry Christmas.

01:40:04.489 --> 01:40:06.825
Come on. Let's
get out of here.

01:40:30.848 --> 01:40:31.974
Nice.

01:40:33.517 --> 01:40:34.977
The fact you have
duds like these

01:40:35.102 --> 01:40:36.520
might make someone
question your...

01:40:36.645 --> 01:40:37.646
My taste?

01:40:37.771 --> 01:40:39.023
Yeah. So to speak.

01:40:39.148 --> 01:40:41.191
I don't know about you,
but I'm headed to Miami.

01:40:41.317 --> 01:40:42.942
Miami's good.

01:40:43.818 --> 01:40:45.820
I'll meet you
down there.

01:40:47.071 --> 01:40:49.157
Once I got my baby girl.

01:40:56.205 --> 01:40:58.791
It's a shame I didn't get to
take care of that bitch Hennessey.

01:40:58.875 --> 01:41:01.502
Yeah. That is a shame.

01:41:13.513 --> 01:41:15.098
Frankenstein has
been retrieved.

01:41:15.223 --> 01:41:18.268
And, ma'am, ratings
are off the charts.

01:41:19.353 --> 01:41:22.522
Gifts and congratulations
are already coming in.

01:41:24.524 --> 01:41:26.109
You win again.

01:41:26.610 --> 01:41:28.070
Mr. Ulrich,

01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:31.907
I always win.

01:41:34.408 --> 01:41:35.701
Damn.

01:41:43.501 --> 01:41:45.127
I love this game.

01:42:15.740 --> 01:42:17.742
So we had to fix this car?

01:42:18.493 --> 01:42:20.704
How many times we gonna
keep doing this, man?

01:42:20.787 --> 01:42:22.747
This car is not
gonna start.

01:42:26.375 --> 01:42:27.459
Damn it!

01:42:27.918 --> 01:42:30.754
You say you want me to live
the life of an honest man, huh?

01:42:30.838 --> 01:42:33.257
Yep. You better
get used to it.

01:42:39.179 --> 01:42:40.264
Hey, Igor.

01:42:44.893 --> 01:42:46.228
Think we got
a little company.

01:43:29.394 --> 01:43:30.395
What took you so long?

01:43:30.479 --> 01:43:32.648
Had trouble getting my
release papers approved.

01:43:32.773 --> 01:43:35.776
Wait here. There's
someone I want you to meet.

01:43:39.863 --> 01:43:41.573
Look at her.

01:43:42.616 --> 01:43:44.284
She has beautiful eyes.

01:43:44.409 --> 01:43:45.826
They're her mother's.

01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:47.703
Where'd you get the rims?

01:43:47.828 --> 01:43:49.705
I won it.
Card game.

01:43:50.164 --> 01:43:51.123
Yeah, right.

01:43:51.249 --> 01:43:52.291
No, really.

01:43:52.625 --> 01:43:54.293
How many horsepower's in this engine?

01:43:54.377 --> 01:43:56.128
Five hundred.

01:43:56.921 --> 01:43:58.297
You sure
about that?

01:43:58.422 --> 01:44:00.091
<i>Someone
once asked me,</i>

01:44:00.216 --> 01:44:02.802
<i>did I think I was the best
future for my little girl?</i>

01:44:04.178 --> 01:44:06.597
<i>Something I've thought
about for a long time.</i>

01:44:07.348 --> 01:44:09.016
<i>This is what I decided.</i>

01:44:10.142 --> 01:44:13.728
<i>No one in this world is perfect.
Heaven knows I'm not.</i>

01:44:15.397 --> 01:44:18.775
<i>But I love her more than
anyone else possibly could.</i>

01:44:19.359 --> 01:44:22.696
<i>In the end, that's
all that matters.</i>

01:44:22.779 --> 01:44:26.992
<i>She's my chance at something else.
Something better.</i>

01:44:27.075 --> 01:44:29.786
<i>And there's no way
I'm letting go of that.</i>

01:50:27.046 --> 01:50:31.092
<i>Okay, cocksucker, fuck with me,</i>

01:50:31.175 --> 01:50:33.219
<i>and we'll see who
shits on the sidewalk.</i>
