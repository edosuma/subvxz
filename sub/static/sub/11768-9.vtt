ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, L.P.

00:13.533 --> 00:16.167
DID I DO SOMETHING ?

00:16.200 --> 00:17.500
WELL, WHY DO I HAVE
TO MEET YOU ?

00:17.533 --> 00:20.033
WELL, I DON'T REALLY SEE
WHAT THE BENEFIT IS

00:20.067 --> 00:21.233
IN TELLING ME,
IN PERSON,

00:21.267 --> 00:22.400
AS OPPOSED TO
TELLING ME ON THE PHONE,

00:22.433 --> 00:24.300
IT'S THE SAME THING.

00:24.333 --> 00:26.000
WELL, JUST PRETEND
WE'RE BLIND,

00:26.033 --> 00:27.767
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH THAT ?

00:27.800 --> 00:32.200
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S
WHAT IT IS FOR THEM.

00:32.233 --> 00:33.667
HEY, MY WIFE
IS HOME.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.633
HELLO.

00:35.667 --> 00:36.833
HI, WHO ARE YOU
TALKING TO ?

00:36.867 --> 00:37.900
RICHARD LEWIS.

00:37.933 --> 00:39.767
I'VE BEEN ORDERED
OFF THE PHONE.

00:39.800 --> 00:43.133
OKAY, I'LL MEET YOU
THERE IN 10 MINUTES.

00:43.167 --> 00:45.600
ALRIGHT,
VERY GOOD.

00:45.633 --> 00:49.000
WHAT DID
THE DOCTOR SAY ?

00:49.033 --> 00:51.600
WELL, HE SAID THAT
I HAVE DERMATITIS.

00:51.633 --> 00:52.767
REALLY ?

00:52.800 --> 00:53.867
YEAH.

00:53.900 --> 00:56.067
BUT, IF I GET
THIS FILLED

00:56.100 --> 00:57.967
AND PUT IT ON,
IT'LL BE FINE.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.333
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BACK UP,

00:59.367 --> 01:00.700
I DON'T THINK
IT'S CONTAGIOUS.

01:00.733 --> 01:01.900
IS IT CONTAGIOUS ?

01:01.933 --> 01:03.067
HOW'D YOU GET THAT,
WHAT IS IT ?

01:03.067 --> 01:04.433
I HAVE NO IDEA,
IT'S A VIRUS.

01:04.467 --> 01:07.167
BUT HE SAID IF I TAKE THIS
THREE TIMES A DAY,

01:07.200 --> 01:08.333
RUB IT ON,
IT'LL BE FINE.

01:08.367 --> 01:09.867
I'M PASSING IT
OVER TO YOU

01:09.900 --> 01:11.500
BECAUSE I'M HOPING
THAT YOU'LL TAKE IT
TO THE DRUGSTORE.

01:11.533 --> 01:15.667
ALRIGHT, UM, I HAVE TO MEET
RICHARD LEWIS FIRST,

01:15.700 --> 01:17.767
HE WANTS TO TALK TO ME
ABOUT SOMETHING.

01:17.800 --> 01:19.200
GOD KNOWS.

01:19.233 --> 01:20.467
I THOUGHT WE WERE
GOING TO DINNER.

01:20.500 --> 01:22.800
NO, WE ARE, SO, I'LL GET
THE PRESCRIPTION FILLED

01:22.833 --> 01:24.767
AFTER I TALK TO HIM,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ?

01:24.800 --> 01:26.067
CAN I JUST MEET YOU
AT THE RESTAURANT ?

01:26.067 --> 01:27.200
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T
PAY FOR ME...

01:27.233 --> 01:28.833
THEN WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TWO CARS--

01:28.867 --> 01:31.100
I DON'T WANNA HAVE TO
COME ALL THE WAY
BACK HERE TO GET YOU,

01:31.133 --> 01:32.733
IT'S RIGHT
BY THE RESTAURANT.

01:32.767 --> 01:33.867
I'D RATHER NOT
TAKE MY CAR.

01:33.900 --> 01:36.967
CAN'T ROSA TAKE YOU ?
SHE DRIVES RIGHT BY THERE.

01:37.067 --> 01:38.067
HUH ?

01:38.100 --> 01:39.200
OKAY, THAT'S FINE, YEAH.

01:39.233 --> 01:41.567
SO, AT 6:00,
THEN ?

01:41.600 --> 01:42.633
6:00.

01:42.667 --> 01:43.933
OKAY.

01:43.967 --> 01:45.933
AT THE BYZANTINE, AND
I'LL GET YOUR THING FILLED.

01:45.967 --> 01:47.933
OKAY,
THANKS.ALR.

01:49.667 --> 01:50.933
LARRY, THANKS
FOR COMING OUT.

01:50.967 --> 01:53.167
I KNOW YOU'RE
BUSY, AND...

01:53.200 --> 01:57.400
I'M JUST CURIOUS AS TO
WHAT YOU WANNA TELL ME.

01:57.433 --> 01:58.800
IT'S NOT EASY
FOR ME TO SAY THIS,

01:58.833 --> 02:01.300
IT'S BEEN BUGGING ME
FOR A WHILE AND,

02:01.333 --> 02:04.100
I THINK WE'RE AT
SOME KIND OF CROSSROADS.

02:04.133 --> 02:06.667
YOU DON'T CALL ME,
I'M ALWAYS INITIATING.

02:06.700 --> 02:08.800
I ASK YOU TO DO THINGS,
I ASK YOU,

02:08.833 --> 02:11.867
WHATEVER I DO, IT'S
ALWAYS COMING FROM MY END

02:11.900 --> 02:14.067
AND I FEEL LIKE
IF I NEVER CALLED YOU,

02:14.067 --> 02:15.733
I'D FALL OFF
THE FACE OF THE EARTH

02:15.767 --> 02:17.600
AND WE WOULDN'T
BE FRIENDS ANYMORE,

02:17.633 --> 02:19.900
AND, MY SHRINK ACTUALLY
TOLD ME TO CONFRONT
YOU ON THIS,

02:19.933 --> 02:21.900
AND, UH, AND I AM,
SO, THAT'S IT.

02:21.933 --> 02:24.567
CAN I BE HONEST
WITH YOU ?

02:24.600 --> 02:25.900
I HOPE SO.

02:25.933 --> 02:29.067
IT'S SOFIA,
YOU KNOW,

02:29.067 --> 02:30.267
IT'S YOUR
GIRLFRIEND.

02:30.300 --> 02:31.333
SOFIA ?

02:31.367 --> 02:32.367
YEAH.

02:32.400 --> 02:33.733
I DON'T GET
ALONG WITH HER,

02:33.767 --> 02:35.267
AND, SO, I TEND
NOT TO CALL,

02:35.300 --> 02:37.267
OR GET TOGETHER...

02:37.300 --> 02:38.600
YOU ACTUALLY
THINK THAT'S FAIR ?

02:38.633 --> 02:40.400
I MEAN, THIS
IS MY GIRLFRIEND.

02:40.433 --> 02:41.433
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S FAIR,

02:41.467 --> 02:42.700
IT'S JUST THAT'S
WHAT'S STOPPING ME,

02:42.733 --> 02:43.900
THAT'S WHY I HAVEN'T
BEEN CALLING.

02:43.933 --> 02:46.200
SHE'S AN EXTENSION
OF MY LIFE FOR CHRISSAKE,

02:46.233 --> 02:47.667
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE,
I LOVE...

02:47.700 --> 02:50.067
YOU KNOW, YOUR WIFE,
SHE'S EMBARRASSED ME

02:50.100 --> 02:51.600
A COUPLE OF TIMES,
EVEN IN JEST,

02:51.633 --> 02:52.700
AND I DON'T SAY,
"I DON'T WANNA

02:52.733 --> 02:54.267
BE YOUR FRIEND
ANYMORE."

02:54.300 --> 02:55.833
I DON'T KNOW,
I JUST DON'T THINK

02:55.867 --> 02:59.200
A FRIEND CAN JUST BOLT
FROM A FRIENDSHIP.

02:59.233 --> 03:01.200
ALRIGHT, CHERYL AND I ARE
GOING OUT TO DINNER TONIGHT,

03:01.233 --> 03:03.233
WHY DON'T
THE TWO OF YOU
JOIN US ?

03:03.267 --> 03:04.300
BUT, WHY DO YOU
WANNA DO THAT ?

03:04.333 --> 03:06.467
'CAUSE I WANNA MAKE UP
AND START ALL OVER.

03:06.500 --> 03:07.533
REALLY ?

03:07.567 --> 03:09.067
YOU'RE NOT JUST
DOING THIS TO...

03:09.067 --> 03:10.167
I APPRECIATE IT,
BUT, I MEAN,

03:10.200 --> 03:11.433
SHE'S PART OF
MY LIFE, SOFIA.

03:11.467 --> 03:15.267
I KNOW, AND, I WANNA TRY
AND BE FRIENDS WITH HER.

03:15.300 --> 03:17.933
THIS IS A VERY
NICE GESTURE, AND,

03:17.967 --> 03:19.267
OH, TONIGHT ?

03:19.300 --> 03:21.500
OH, FUCK, I CAN'T,
WE'RE DOING SOMETHING EARLY.

03:21.533 --> 03:23.067
CAN YOU COME OVER
AFTER DINNER AND HAVE

03:23.067 --> 03:25.067
COFFEE AND DESSERT OR
SOMETHING AT OUR PLACE ?

03:25.100 --> 03:26.100
YEAH, WE WON'T
HAVE DESSERT.

03:26.133 --> 03:27.233
WE'LL COME OVER
FOR DESSERT AND COFFEE.

03:27.267 --> 03:28.800
FANTASTIC.

03:28.833 --> 03:30.267
JUSTIN ?

03:30.300 --> 03:31.633
LEWIS.

03:31.667 --> 03:32.867
HOW YA DOING ?

03:32.900 --> 03:34.067
HEY, MAN.

03:34.067 --> 03:35.967
GOOD TO SEE YOU, MAN,
WHAT'S HAPPENING ?

03:36.067 --> 03:38.067
OH, I'M SORRY,
I'M FUNKY.

03:38.067 --> 03:39.167
DR. GRAMBS,
THIS IS MY FRIEND,

03:39.200 --> 03:40.200
LARRY DAVID.

03:40.233 --> 03:41.267
THIS IS MY
DERMATOLOGIST.

03:41.300 --> 03:42.367
REALLY ?

03:42.400 --> 03:43.633
OH, YEAH, WHAT,
FOR 15 YEARS ALREADY ?

03:43.667 --> 03:45.733
EVEN WITH THE WHOLE
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION THING ?

03:47.467 --> 03:49.667
I'M SORRY, I BEG
YOUR PARDON, WHAT ?

03:49.700 --> 03:51.767
YEAH, WHAT
DO YOU MEAN ?

03:51.800 --> 03:52.900
IT WAS A JOKE.

03:52.933 --> 03:55.233
"THE WHOLE AFFIRMATIVE
ACTION THING" ?

03:55.267 --> 03:58.700
IT WAS A JOKE.

03:58.733 --> 04:02.067
HE'S LIKE
A BUDDY.

04:02.100 --> 04:03.767
I KNOW HIM, I MEAN,
HE'S A SWEETHEART.

04:03.800 --> 04:06.233
THE IMPLICATION BEING
THAT I WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH

04:06.267 --> 04:07.567
TO BE A DERMATOLOGIST ?

04:07.600 --> 04:10.667
NO, NO, COME ON,
NO, IT WAS JOKE.

04:10.700 --> 04:12.700
HE'S A LIBERAL,
HE'S LIKE YOU AND ME.

04:12.733 --> 04:13.767
SO, IF I WASN'T BLACK

04:13.800 --> 04:15.367
HE WOULD HAVE SAID
THE SAME THING OR,

04:15.400 --> 04:16.467
OR NOT.

04:16.500 --> 04:17.567
DO YOU SEE MY POINT ?

04:17.600 --> 04:19.667
YEAH, I SEE IT IN
A HISTORICAL SENSE,

04:19.700 --> 04:22.200
BUT, NOT IN
A NICE DAY SENSE.

04:22.233 --> 04:23.900
YOU KNOW, RICHARD,
I'VE WORKED TOO HARD

04:23.933 --> 04:27.433
AND TOO LONG AT THIS,
I CAN'T DO IT.

04:27.467 --> 04:29.333
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS TRIP IS,
BUT, I CAN'T DO IT.

04:29.367 --> 04:32.367
I DON'T HAVE ANY TRIP,
NO, IT WAS JOKE !

04:34.400 --> 04:38.800
HOLY SHIT !
WHAT HIT YOU ?

04:38.833 --> 04:40.133
IT WAS A JOKE.

04:40.167 --> 04:42.500
I KNOW IT'S A JOKE,
BUT, YOU SOUNDED LIKE

04:42.533 --> 04:44.733
PAT BUCHANAN'S GYM PARTNER
FOR CHRISSAKES !

04:44.767 --> 04:46.433
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO BE AFFABLE.

04:46.467 --> 04:47.933
LOOK, I'LL
SEE YOU TONIGHT,

04:47.967 --> 04:50.167
HOPEFULLY, WE'LL
RESOLVE, YOU KNOW.

04:50.200 --> 04:53.533
I TEND TO SAY STUPID THINGS
TO BLACK PEOPLE SOMETIMES.

04:53.567 --> 04:55.267
THAT'S LIKE GONNA BE
IN THE TIME CAPSULE

04:55.300 --> 04:56.333
FOR CHRISSAKE !

04:56.367 --> 04:57.767
LOOK, I'LL SEE
YOU LATER ON.

04:57.800 --> 05:00.600
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO BE AFFABLE.

05:14.067 --> 05:16.167
HEY, I'M SO GLAD
YOU'RE HERE.

05:16.200 --> 05:18.867
I KNOW,
THIS PLACE IS CRAZY.

05:18.900 --> 05:20.467
THERE'S NO TABLES,

05:20.500 --> 05:22.367
YOU COULDN'T GET
A RESERVATION,

05:22.400 --> 05:24.767
WE'RE ON
A WAITING LIST.

05:24.800 --> 05:26.133
CAN YOU GIVE ME
MY PRESCRIPTION ?

05:26.167 --> 05:27.800
I THINK I'M GONNA GO
TO THE LADIES' ROOM, AND,

05:27.833 --> 05:30.167
PUT SOME ON.

05:30.200 --> 05:32.133
WHAT ?

05:32.167 --> 05:34.267
SHOOT, I FORGOT IT.

05:34.300 --> 05:38.267
I'M SORRY, I WAS
SO DISCOMBOBULATED

05:38.300 --> 05:40.467
BECAUSE,
OH, MY GOD,

05:40.500 --> 05:42.800
I COMPLETELY
HUMILIATED MYSELF.

05:42.833 --> 05:43.900
WHAT HAPPENED ?

05:43.933 --> 05:46.167
I WAS WITH RICHARD LEWIS,
AND WE WERE TALKING,

05:46.200 --> 05:47.400
AND THEN HE RAN
INTO HIS FRIEND,

05:47.433 --> 05:48.600
THIS BLACK DOCTOR,

05:48.633 --> 05:52.967
AND, I MADE SOME
TERRIBLE JOKE

05:53.067 --> 05:54.867
ABOUT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION,

05:54.900 --> 05:56.067
AND IT WAS
BEYOND AWFUL.

05:56.067 --> 05:57.233
I'M SURE YOU'RE
MAKING IT OUT TO BE

05:57.267 --> 05:58.333
MORE THAN IT WAS.

05:58.367 --> 06:00.800
NO, I'M MAKING IT OUT
TO BE LESS THAN IT WAS.

06:00.833 --> 06:02.433
AND HE TOOK IT
THE WRONG WAY.

06:02.467 --> 06:04.233
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN MAKE
A JOKE ABOUT THAT ?

06:04.267 --> 06:07.067
BECAUSE, I DON'T KNOW,
I WAS TRYING TO BE AFFABLE.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.433
I WAS TRYING
TOO HARD TO BE AFFABLE.

06:08.467 --> 06:10.300
WHY EVEN JOKE
ABOUT IT, THOUGH ?

06:10.333 --> 06:12.400
I MADE A MISTAKE,
IT WAS A STUPID THING TO SAY.

06:12.433 --> 06:14.600
I'M A SCHMUCK, I DON'T KNOW,
I DID A SCHMUCKY THING.

06:14.633 --> 06:15.700
DID YOU
APOLOGIZE ?

06:15.733 --> 06:17.367
OF COURSE
I APOLOGIZED.

06:17.400 --> 06:20.733
WELL, I HAVE TO SAY
I'M NOT REAL HAPPY,

06:20.767 --> 06:21.967
RIGHT NOW,
BECAUSE...

06:22.067 --> 06:23.067
WELL, WE'LL
HAVE DINNER

06:23.067 --> 06:24.067
AND THEN WE'LL GO
RIGHT TO THE DRUGSTORE.

06:24.100 --> 06:25.133
NO PROBLEM.

06:25.167 --> 06:26.400
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE PROBLEM IS ?

06:26.433 --> 06:27.733
IS THAT IT'S GONNA BE
HOURS BEFORE WE GET THERE

06:27.767 --> 06:29.600
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT EVEN
GONNA HAVE A SEAT,

06:29.633 --> 06:31.600
UNTIL, I DON'T KNOW,
LIKE AN HOUR.

06:31.633 --> 06:33.533
REALLY.

06:33.567 --> 06:35.567
YEAH, AND I'M
STARVING, YOU KNOW.

06:35.600 --> 06:39.067
LET'S TRY
SOMETHING HERE.

06:39.100 --> 06:40.533
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING ?

06:40.567 --> 06:42.967
YOU HAVE
A LITTLE PLAN ?

06:43.067 --> 06:44.333
I GOT A
LITTLE PLAN.

06:44.367 --> 06:45.400
YEAH ?

06:45.433 --> 06:46.467
WELL, WHAT DO
YOU THINK ?

06:46.500 --> 06:47.500
YEAH, SURE.

06:47.533 --> 06:48.533
MEN DO THIS,
RIGHT ?

06:48.567 --> 06:49.567
I'VE SEEN
MEN DO IT.

06:49.600 --> 06:50.567
HAVEN'T WE
SEEN THIS ?

06:50.600 --> 06:51.767
I'VE SEEN MEN
DO IT IN MOVIES.

06:53.200 --> 06:55.600
GOOD EVENING, SIR,
WELCOME TO THE BYZANTINE.

06:55.633 --> 06:58.800
UM, I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT,
HOW LONG IS THE WAIT ?

06:58.833 --> 07:00.433
OH, I'M AFRAID
IT LOOKS LIKE,

07:00.467 --> 07:02.567
45 MINUTES
TO AN HOUR.

07:02.600 --> 07:04.533
45 MINUTES TO AN HOUR,
NO WAY TO GET IN ?

07:04.567 --> 07:09.367
NO, WE'RE VERY CROWDED
THIS EVENING, SIR.

07:09.400 --> 07:10.433
RIGHT NOW
WE'RE VERY FULL.

07:10.467 --> 07:12.200
NOTHING ELSE
CAN BE DONE ?

07:12.233 --> 07:15.100
WELL, NOTHING THAT
I CAN THINK OF, SIR.

07:15.133 --> 07:16.267
THINGS ARE DONE, RIGHT,
AREN'T THINGS DONE ?

07:16.300 --> 07:18.633
I HEAR THINGS
ARE DONE.

07:20.600 --> 07:22.767
FROM TIME TO TIME.

07:25.067 --> 07:27.367
ANYTHING
YOU CAN DO...

07:27.400 --> 07:30.400
ACTUALLY, I THINK WE CAN
ACCOMMODATE YOU RIGHT NOW.

07:30.433 --> 07:31.933
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO FOLLOW ME ?

07:35.600 --> 07:37.333
THANK YOU.

07:37.367 --> 07:38.867
THANK YOU

07:41.800 --> 07:43.167
WOW, I'M PRETTY
IMPRESSED.

07:44.433 --> 07:45.967
I'M VERY,
VERY IMPRESSED,
I REALLY AM.

07:46.067 --> 07:47.800
NO BIG DEAL.

07:47.833 --> 07:50.433
I AM EXTREMELY ATTRACTED
TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

07:50.467 --> 07:51.567
THAT'S 'CAUSE
IT'S CRIMINAL.

07:51.600 --> 07:52.600
IS IT ?

07:52.633 --> 07:53.933
BECAUSE WOMEN
ARE ATTRACTED TO CRIMINALS,

07:53.967 --> 07:54.967
AND THEY DO THAT
ALL THE TIME.

07:55.067 --> 07:56.667
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD
DO THAT ALL THE TIME.

07:56.700 --> 07:58.767
JUST WALK AROUND, AND,
CUT IN LINE ANY TIME YOU WANT.

07:58.800 --> 08:00.533
ALRIGHT, DO IT
ALL THE TIME NOW,

08:00.567 --> 08:01.633
WE'LL NEVER
HAVE TO WAIT.

08:01.667 --> 08:03.167
SHOULD I FEEL
GUILTY ABOUT IT ?

08:03.200 --> 08:05.300
WHY, BECAUSE
ALL THOSE PEOPLE
ARE STILL WAITING ?

08:05.333 --> 08:07.300
WELL, I CAN'T STOP
TO THINK ABOUT IT

08:07.333 --> 08:08.933
BECAUSE
I'M STARVING.

08:08.967 --> 08:10.167
HOW CAN
A HANDICAPPED PERSON

08:10.200 --> 08:12.367
USE A NON-MOTORIZED
WHEELCHAIR ?

08:12.400 --> 08:15.067
I DON'T
GET THAT.

08:15.067 --> 08:16.200
WHAT'S THE POINT TO IT ?

08:16.233 --> 08:19.067
TO ME, THAT'S
YOUR BIG PRIORITY.

08:19.067 --> 08:21.700
WELL, MAYBE HE LIKES
THE EXERCISE.

08:21.733 --> 08:22.967
I'M SURE YOU
GET USED TO IT.

08:23.067 --> 08:24.533
WELL, CAN'T HE GET ONE
THAT HAS BOTH ?

08:24.567 --> 08:26.867
MOTOR AND NON-MOTOR ?
THEN YOU COULD DO BOTH.

08:26.900 --> 08:28.067
YOU WANT EXERCISE,
YOU EXERCISE,

08:28.100 --> 08:29.467
YOU WANT THE MOTOR,
YOU GOT THE MOTOR.

08:29.500 --> 08:30.800
THIS WAY YOU
HAVE NO OPTIONS.

08:30.833 --> 08:32.367
YOU GOTTA DO THIS
THE WHOLE TIME.

08:32.400 --> 08:33.867
IF YOU'RE NOT IN A HURRY
TO GET SOMEWHERE,

08:33.900 --> 08:35.433
WHY NOT ?

08:35.467 --> 08:37.267
THERE'S
TED HARBERT.

08:37.300 --> 08:38.567
WHO'S TED HARBERT ?

08:38.600 --> 08:40.900
HE USED TO BE
THE PRESIDENT OF ABC,

08:40.933 --> 08:42.933
NOW HE RUNS
NBC STUDIOS.

08:42.967 --> 08:44.733
I HAVE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM,

08:44.767 --> 08:46.567
I'M GONNA HAVE TO WALK
RIGHT BY THAT TABLE.

08:46.600 --> 08:49.200
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT,
YOU DON'T LIKE HIM ?

08:49.233 --> 08:51.067
HE JUST MAKES
THE WORST SMALL TALK,

08:51.067 --> 08:54.067
AND, IT'S GONNA BE SO,
I'LL NEVER GET OUT OF THERE.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.400
JUST DON'T STOP.

08:55.433 --> 08:57.067
JUST KEEP WALKING
AND SAY, HELLO.

08:57.100 --> 08:58.167
YOU HAVE TO STOP,

08:58.200 --> 08:59.900
YOU CAN'T JUST SAY
HELLO AND WALK ON.

09:00.067 --> 09:02.933
OOH, SEA BASS.

09:02.967 --> 09:04.067
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

09:04.067 --> 09:05.200
THERE'S A RESTAURANT
TWO DOORS DOWN,

09:05.233 --> 09:06.400
I'M GONNA
GO IN THERE.

09:06.433 --> 09:07.800
OKAY, I'M GONNA GO TO
THE BATHROOM IN THERE.

09:07.833 --> 09:10.867
YOU'RE GONNA LEAVE
THIS RESTAURANT

09:10.900 --> 09:12.433
TO GO USE THE BATHROOM
SOMEWHERE ELSE ?

09:12.467 --> 09:13.533
ARE YOU OUT
OF YOUR MIND ?

09:13.567 --> 09:15.533
NO, I DON'T
WANNA SAY HELLO,

09:15.567 --> 09:17.533
I DON'T LIKE
THOSE HELLOS.

09:32.700 --> 09:34.167
MEN'S ROOM ?

09:37.067 --> 09:40.600
LARRY, LARRY DAVID,
LARRY DAVID.

09:40.633 --> 09:41.800
HOW YA DOING ?

09:41.833 --> 09:42.900
OKAY.

09:42.933 --> 09:44.533
DO YOU REMEMBER ME,
DENISE PENDERGRASS ?

09:44.567 --> 09:46.300
WE HAD A MEETING
A FEW YEARS AGO ?

09:46.333 --> 09:48.833
I MET WITH YOU ABOUT THAT
FILM PROJECT YOU WERE DOING.

09:48.867 --> 09:51.233
OH, "SOUR GRAPES",
THE LINE PRODUCER.

09:51.267 --> 09:53.533
YES, I REMEMBER.

09:53.567 --> 09:55.800
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT ?
I'M SO GLAD I RAN INTO YOU.

09:55.833 --> 09:57.467
'CAUSE WE HAD
A REALLY NICE MEETING,

09:57.500 --> 09:59.767
AND, YOU KNOW, YOU SAID
MY RESUME LOOKED GREAT

09:59.800 --> 10:00.800
AND YOU SAID
I WAS QUALIFIED,

10:00.833 --> 10:02.067
AND, THEN, I DIDN'T
HEAR FROM YOU

10:02.100 --> 10:03.900
AND, ALL THESE YEARS
I WONDERED, WHAT HAPPENED ?

10:03.933 --> 10:06.767
'CAUSE I REALLY WANTED
TO WORK WITH YOU,

10:06.800 --> 10:09.667
AND, WHAT WAS
THE PERSON'S NAME
THAT GOT THAT JOB ?

10:09.700 --> 10:11.667
WHAT WAS, WHAT ?

10:11.700 --> 10:12.700
BARRY.

10:12.733 --> 10:15.567
OH, BARRY, BARRY,
A FRIEND OF YOURS, OR...

10:15.600 --> 10:16.633
FRIEND OF MY WIFE.

10:16.667 --> 10:17.800
A FRIEND OF
YOUR WIFE.

10:17.833 --> 10:19.033
A BLACK FRIEND ?

10:19.067 --> 10:20.333
NO.

10:20.367 --> 10:22.400
THIS IS THE THING, I HAD
A COUPLE OF MARGARITAS,

10:22.433 --> 10:24.267
BUT, I'M NOT
GONNA HOLD BACK.

10:24.300 --> 10:25.467
I JUST WAS
WONDERING,

10:25.500 --> 10:27.900
WHY DO YOU
HAVE A PROBLEM

10:27.933 --> 10:29.000
GIVING SOMEBODY
LIKE ME A JOB ?

10:29.033 --> 10:30.133
WHAT ?
A PROBLEM ?

10:30.167 --> 10:32.067
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ?

10:32.100 --> 10:33.800
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE
INTERVIEWED FOR THAT.

10:33.833 --> 10:35.300
YEAH, A LOT OF PEOPLE,
BUT, YOU AND I,

10:35.333 --> 10:36.400
WE HAD A RAPPORT.

10:36.433 --> 10:38.333
WE DID, BUT, THE GUY
KNEW MY WIFE, I MEAN,

10:38.367 --> 10:40.100
THAT'S ALL IT WAS.

10:40.133 --> 10:42.467
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
IMPLYING, BUT,

10:42.500 --> 10:44.500
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
IS TERRIBLE.

10:44.533 --> 10:47.333
WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT
I WATCHED YOUR SHOW, "SEINFELD"

10:47.367 --> 10:49.167
FOR HOW MANY, SEVEN,
EIGHT YEARS ON THE AIR,

10:49.200 --> 10:50.533
AND, NOT-A-ONE
BLACK PERSON,

10:50.567 --> 10:52.233
AND, I LIVED IN NEW YORK
FOR SEVERAL YEARS,

10:52.267 --> 10:54.000
AND THERE IS A PLETHORA
OF BLACK PEOPLE IN NEW YORK,

10:54.033 --> 10:56.400
BUT, SOMEHOW, ELAINE CAN
NEVER HAVE A BLACK GIRLFRIEND,

10:56.433 --> 10:58.133
JERRY NEVER HAD ANY
BLACK GIRLFRIENDS,

10:58.167 --> 10:59.167
IN THEIR LITTLE
CIRCLE OF FRIENDS,

10:59.200 --> 11:00.333
NOBODY LOOKED
LIKE ME.

11:00.367 --> 11:01.433
I MEAN, WHAT
IS THAT ABOUT ?

11:01.467 --> 11:03.267
IS IT A BLACK THING
WITH LARRY DAVID ?

11:03.300 --> 11:07.267
THERE'S NO BLACK THING,
IT'S A NOTHING !

11:07.300 --> 11:08.600
NO, NO, NO,
A SISTER LIKE ME

11:08.633 --> 11:09.700
CAN KINDA SEE THROUGH
THINGS LIKE THIS,

11:09.733 --> 11:10.733
AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW

11:10.767 --> 11:12.167
THAT I THINK I GOT
YOUR NUMBER NOW.

11:12.200 --> 11:13.733
THERE'S NO NUMBER,
YOU DON'T HAVE A NUMBER !

11:13.767 --> 11:16.367
THERE'S NO NUMBER TO HAVE,
I DON'T HAVE A NUMBER !

11:16.400 --> 11:19.300
I SAW "SOUR GRAPES", AND,
THE TITLE WAS VERY APROPOS,

11:19.333 --> 11:20.833
AND MAYBE IT WAS A BLESSING
IN DISGUISE FOR ME

11:20.867 --> 11:22.067
THAT I DID NOT
GET THAT JOB.

11:22.100 --> 11:23.667
AND, I JUST HOPE YOU HAVE
A VERY NICE DINNER.

11:23.700 --> 11:26.500
THANK YOU,
MR. LARRY DAVID.

11:33.667 --> 11:35.067
WHERE HAVE

11:35.100 --> 11:36.167

12:47.600 --> 12:50.100
WHAT'S WRONG ?

12:50.133 --> 12:52.767

12:56.467 --> 12:58.333
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT,
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

12:58.367 --> 13:00.267
THERE'S A $20 BILL
FOLDED IN MY POCKET.

13:00.300 --> 13:01.400
THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
FOR THE MAITRE D',

13:01.433 --> 13:02.467
WHAT'S IT DOING
IN MY POCKET ?

13:02.500 --> 13:03.567
I DON'T KNOW,

13:03.600 --> 13:05.733
I GAVE YOU

THIS AFTERNOON.

13:05.767 --> 13:07.067
I KNOW, AND
I FOLDED IT UP

13:07.067 --> 13:09.100
AND IT WAS IN THE SAME
POCKET AS THE 20,

13:09.133 --> 13:11.600
AND I MUST HAVE
PUT MY HAND IN MY POCKET

13:11.633 --> 13:13.167
AND PULLED OUT...

13:13.200 --> 13:15.067
DID YOU NOT LOOK
AT IT, LARRY ?

13:15.067 --> 13:16.167
IT FELT LIKE THE 20.

13:16.200 --> 13:18.233
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW THAT COULD HAPPEN.

13:18.267 --> 13:20.133
THEY WERE FOLDED UP,
THEY FELT ALIKE !

13:20.167 --> 13:22.500
DID HE LOOK AT IT ?

13:22.533 --> 13:24.567
NO, THEY TAKE IT AND
PUT IT IN THEIR POCKET.

13:24.600 --> 13:26.700
WHY WOULD I HAVE
THE 20 ON ME ?

13:26.733 --> 13:30.100
THIS WAS THE 20 THAT WAS
DESIGNATED FOR THE MAITRE D' !

13:30.133 --> 13:32.367
COME ON, LET'S JUST GO
BACK TO THE RESTAURANT.

13:32.400 --> 13:34.200
OH, MY GOD !

13:38.500 --> 13:40.267
WHY DON'T WE JUST
CALL YOUR DOCTOR ?

13:40.300 --> 13:42.300
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T CALL
MY DOCTOR ON THE WEEKENDS

13:42.333 --> 13:43.933
UNLESS IT'S
A LIFE-THREATENING

15:19.767 --> 15:21.400
WE'D SIT THERE
FOR EIGHT HOURS.

15:21.433 --> 15:23.133
THIS IS A VERY
PLEASANT ACTIVITY.

15:23.167 --> 15:24.867
MAYBE YOU CAN LOCK ME IN
A TOILET AFTER THIS, HUH ?

15:24.900 --> 15:26.300
MAYBE YOU COULD PICK UP
MY PRESCRIPTION

15:26.333 --> 15:27.567
WHEN I ASK YOU
THE FIRST TIME

15:27.600 --> 15:29.233
AND THEN NONE OF THIS
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.

15:29.267 --> 15:31.067
WAIT A SECOND.

15:31.067 --> 15:32.900
WHAT ABOUT
RICHARD'S FRIEND ?

15:32.933 --> 15:35.567
HE'S A DERMATOLOGIST,
THE GUY I OFFENDED TODAY.

15:35.600 --> 15:37.567
THE BLACK GUY ?
HE'S A DERMATOLOGIST ?

15:37.600 --> 15:39.933
YES, WE'RE GOING OVER
TO RICHARD'S ANYWAY.

15:39.967 --> 15:41.733
I COULD CALL HIM UP
AND APOLOGIZE

15:41.767 --> 15:43.767
AND MAYBE HE COULD PHONE IN
THE PRESCRIPTION FOR US.

15:43.800 --> 15:45.733
YEAH, YEAH,
LET'S TRY THAT.

15:45.767 --> 15:47.467
EWW !

15:48.900 --> 15:51.067
HI !
HEY !

15:51.067 --> 15:52.533
HEY, HOW ARE YOU,
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

15:52.567 --> 15:53.900
( Cheryl )
OH, ACTUALLY,
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

15:53.933 --> 15:56.333
YOU DON'T WANNA GET
TOO CLOSE TO ME RIGHT NOW.

15:56.367 --> 15:58.200
( Larry )
WE HAD A BIT
OF A PROBLEM HERE.

15:58.233 --> 16:00.167
RELAX, WE'LL
TALK IT OUT.

16:00.200 --> 16:02.233
SOFIA'S ON THE PHONE,
SHE'LL BE OFF IN A SECOND.

16:02.267 --> 16:03.700
WE'RE NOT REALLY
GONNA BE ABLE TO...

16:03.733 --> 16:06.167
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

16:06.200 --> 16:07.933
BECAUSE, UM...

16:07.967 --> 16:09.733
I'VE GOT A SKIN
PROBLEM RIGHT NOW.

16:09.767 --> 16:12.067
IT'S THIS DERMATITIS
AND IT'S SPREADING,

16:12.067 --> 16:13.267
IS THE PROBLEM,
RICHARD.

16:13.300 --> 16:14.800
WE'VE BEEN DRIVING
ALL NIGHT

16:14.833 --> 16:16.367
BECAUSE I HAD
A PRESCRIPTION...

16:16.400 --> 16:18.900
I DIDN'T LOSE IT,
WHATEVER,

16:18.933 --> 16:20.333
WE DON'T
HAVE IT ANYMORE.

16:20.367 --> 16:22.133
WHY DON'T YOU
CALL YOUR DOCTOR ?

16:22.167 --> 16:24.867
I CAN'T CALL HIM
ON THE WEEKENDS.

16:24.900 --> 16:27.333
IT'S HARD TO
BOTHER THESE PEOPLE.

16:27.367 --> 16:29.267
THE THING IS, WE DON'T
KNOW ANY DOCTORS,

16:29.300 --> 16:31.133
WE DON'T KNOW ANYBODY
WHO CAN HELP HER.

16:31.167 --> 16:32.900
THE ONLY GUY
I COULD THINK OF

16:32.933 --> 16:36.167
IS YOUR FRIEND FROM,
THE DERMATOLOGIST.

16:36.200 --> 16:38.700
THE GUY FROM
TODAY, JUSTIN ?

16:38.733 --> 16:40.567
MAYBE IF YOU COULD
JUST CALL HIM

16:40.600 --> 16:41.633
AND HE COULD CALL IN
A PRESCRIPTION.

16:41.667 --> 16:44.300
WOW, I MEAN,
YOU CAN IMAGINE,

16:44.333 --> 16:47.067
YOU WERE LIKE,
JAMES EARL RAY TODAY
WITH THIS GUY.

16:47.067 --> 16:48.533
I KNOW, I KNOW.

16:48.567 --> 16:51.533
I'LL DO IT,
I'M DOING IT...

16:51.567 --> 16:53.133
JUST TELL HIM
I'LL APOLOGIZE,

16:53.167 --> 16:54.433
YOU KNOW,
I WANNA TALK TO HIM.

16:54.467 --> 16:56.900
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED.

16:56.933 --> 16:58.733
... LIKE A
NIGHTMARE CALL.

16:58.767 --> 17:00.567
I'M SORRY FOR MAKING
YOU DO IT, BELIEVE ME.

17:00.600 --> 17:01.767
WE REALLY
APPRECIATE IT.

17:01.800 --> 17:02.833
HONEY, HELLO,
THE DAVIDS ARE HERE.

17:02.867 --> 17:04.067
HI !

17:04.100 --> 17:05.633
( Richard )
LISTEN, SHE HAS
A MEDICAL EMERGENCY.

17:05.667 --> 17:08.300
HONEY, BABY,
I'M ON THE PHONE.

17:08.333 --> 17:10.067
I'M ON THE PHONE,
I'M ON THE PHONE.

17:10.067 --> 17:11.400
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF THE GUY'S

17:11.433 --> 17:12.767
GONNA BE HOME
OR NOT.

17:12.800 --> 17:15.133
HONEY, ENOUGH,
HEY, DARLING !

17:15.167 --> 17:16.700
I'M ON THE PHONE,
I'M SORRY.

17:16.733 --> 17:19.933
I'M ON THE PHONE,
JUST ONE SECOND.

17:19.967 --> 17:21.567
SHE HAS A MEDICAL
EMERGENCY,

17:21.600 --> 17:23.133
SHE HAS A
TREMENDOUS RASH.

17:23.167 --> 17:25.400
HEY, HEY,
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

17:25.433 --> 17:26.467
JUST GET THE NUMBER,
WE'LL CALL IN THE CAR.

17:26.500 --> 17:27.600
WILL YOU HANG UP
THE PHONE ?!

17:27.633 --> 17:28.633
ARE YOU HAPPY ?

17:28.667 --> 17:29.667
YES, I'M VERY HAPPY.

17:29.700 --> 17:30.867
OH, GOOD, NOW
WE'RE ALL HAPPY.

17:30.900 --> 17:32.667
YOU'RE HAPPY,
HE'S HAPPY, I'M HAPPY.

17:32.700 --> 17:35.067
SHE'S SICK
AND YOU'RE NOT,
HOW'S THAT ?

17:35.067 --> 17:36.800
JESUS CHRIST,

17:36.833 --> 17:39.200
I'M SO FUCKING EMBARRASSED
BY ALL THIS SHIT.

17:41.267 --> 17:42.767
I'M REALLY
SORRY ABOUT THIS.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.433
NO, NO,
DON'T BE SORRY.

17:44.467 --> 17:47.400
DR. GRAMBS ?

17:47.433 --> 17:49.567
HI, I'M SORRY TO
CALL YOU ON A WEEKEND.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.600
YEAH, IT'S LEWIS.

17:51.633 --> 17:54.300
RICHARD, I JUST HUNG UP
WITH MY AGENT ON THE PHONE

17:54.333 --> 17:55.567
WITHOUT EVEN
SAYING GOODBYE.

17:55.600 --> 17:56.933
( Larry )
THIS IS A VERY
IMPORTANT CALL.

17:56.967 --> 17:58.167
MIND YOUR OWN
FUCKING BUSINESS HERE,

17:58.200 --> 17:59.267
THIS IS NOT
YOUR BUSINESS.

17:59.300 --> 18:00.567
IT IS MY BUSINESS !

18:00.600 --> 18:03.900
( Richard )
HE REALLY FEELS
HORRIBLE ABOUT IT,

18:03.933 --> 18:05.200
BUT, HIS WIFE HAS THIS,
WHAT'S IT CALLED ?

18:05.233 --> 18:06.300
( Cheryl )
DERMATITIS.

18:06.333 --> 18:08.200
DERMATITIS
AND WHAT ?

18:08.233 --> 18:10.733
HE'S FUNNY, YEAH,
HE DIDN'T MEAN IT,

18:10.767 --> 18:12.333
HE WANTS TO
APOLOGIZE PROFUSELY.

18:12.367 --> 18:14.300
THE LAST THING HE WOULD
EVER MEAN IS SOMETHING...

18:14.333 --> 18:15.967
I NEED TO HELP THEM,
I'M LOST.

18:16.067 --> 18:18.300
SHE'S VERY SICK,
SHE CAN'T REACH HER DOCTOR,

18:18.333 --> 18:19.533
AND SHE NEEDS TO
GET A PRESCRIPTION,

18:19.567 --> 18:21.167
OTHERWISE THIS
THING'S GONNA SPREAD,

18:21.200 --> 18:22.867
AND, I REALLY WANNA
COME THROUGH FOR THEM.

18:22.900 --> 18:25.933
REALLY ?

18:25.967 --> 18:27.700
OH, YOU'RE
UNBELIEVABLE.

18:27.733 --> 18:28.733
HE SAYS, IF YOU COME
OVER TO THE HOUSE,

18:28.767 --> 18:30.167
HE CAN'T PRESCRIBE
OVER THE PHONE,

18:30.200 --> 18:31.867
IT'S UNETHICAL, BUT,
YOU'LL DO THAT ?

18:31.900 --> 18:33.133
OF COURSE,
ARE YOU KIDDING ?

18:33.167 --> 18:35.167
DOCTOR, YOU'RE
REALLY THE BEST.

18:35.200 --> 18:36.900
WHAT'S YOUR ADDRESS ?

18:36.933 --> 18:38.900
YEAH, HOLD ON,
WHAT'S THE NUMBER ?

18:38.933 --> 18:40.533
OKAY, THANKS.

18:40.567 --> 18:42.800
THANK YOU,
SO MUCH.

18:42.833 --> 18:44.400
OH, CHRIST.

18:44.433 --> 18:45.833
HOW DO YOU
GET THERE ?

18:45.867 --> 18:49.400
CALL THE TRIPLE A,
JUST GET BETTER.

18:50.800 --> 18:51.900
NICE TO SEE
YOU AGAIN !

18:51.933 --> 18:54.067
NICE TO SEE
YOU, TOO.

18:57.267 --> 18:59.700
( navigator )
Right turn ahead.

18:59.733 --> 19:02.067
DID YOU
HEAR THAT ?

19:02.067 --> 19:03.267
YEAH, I DID
HEAR IT.

19:03.300 --> 19:04.600
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM !

19:04.633 --> 19:05.967
I FIGURED IT OUT,
IT'S WORKING !

19:06.067 --> 19:07.500
IT'S TELLING US
EXACTLY HOW TO GO

19:07.533 --> 19:08.933
TO THE DOCTOR'S
HOUSE !

19:08.967 --> 19:11.833
OH, I CAN'T WAIT
TO CALL MY PARENTS.

19:11.867 --> 19:14.067
THEY ARE GONNA BE
SO PROUD OF ME !

19:14.067 --> 19:15.133
WHEN I TELL MY FATHER

19:15.167 --> 19:16.900
I FIGURED OUT THAT
NAVIGATION SYSTEM,

19:16.933 --> 19:19.833
HE'S GONNA FLIP HIS WIG,
AND HE'S GOT ONE, TOO.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.500
CAN WE TURN ON
THE RADIO ?

19:21.533 --> 19:24.200
OH, HE'S GONNA BE VERY
PROUD OF LARRY,

19:24.233 --> 19:26.167
FIGURING OUT
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM !

19:26.200 --> 19:27.167
PLEASE.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.900
OOH, DADDY,
I'M NOT SO STUPID !

19:29.933 --> 19:31.233
CAN WE TURN ON
THE RADIO ?

19:31.267 --> 19:32.367
NO, 'CAUSE THEN
WE WON'T BE ABLE

19:32.400 --> 19:34.400
TO HEAR
THE NAVIGATOR.

19:34.433 --> 19:36.533
( navigator )
Right turn ahead.

19:42.367 --> 19:43.400
HI.

19:43.433 --> 19:44.467
HI.

19:44.500 --> 19:46.933
HI, I'M LARRY DAVID,
THIS IS MY WIFE, CHERYL.

19:46.967 --> 19:48.567
WE'RE A FRIEND OF
RICHARD LEWIS, HE CALLED.

19:48.600 --> 19:50.300
YES, YES, YES,
HI, I'M DONNA,

19:50.333 --> 19:51.367
MY HUSBAND'S

PLEASE, COME IN.

19:52.633 --> 19:54.367
OH, THANK YOU, THANK YOU
SO MUCH FOR HAVING US.

19:54.400 --> 19:55.733
SORRY TO DISTURB YOU

19:55.767 --> 19:56.967
AT THE BEGINNING
OF YOUR WEEKEND.

19:57.067 --> 19:59.767
WELL, THAT'S OKAY,
I MEAN, THE BEST LAID PLANS

19:59.800 --> 20:01.533
ALWAYS WILL CHANGE,
SO LET'S NOT WORRY ABOUT IT.

20:01.567 --> 20:02.767
COME ON IN.

20:02.800 --> 20:04.400
( male )
I THINK BLACK PEOPLE
HAVE A MISTRUST

20:04.433 --> 20:05.667
OF THE MEDICAL
PROFESSION

20:05.700 --> 20:09.367
BECAUSE OF THE VESTIGES
OF THAT EXPERIMENT.

20:09.400 --> 20:12.800
PLEASE,
COME IN.

20:12.833 --> 20:14.933
I HOPE WE'RE NOT
DISTURBING ANYTHING.

20:16.567 --> 20:17.700
EXCUSE ME,
SWEETIE.

20:17.733 --> 20:19.700
EVERYBODY,
THIS IS LARRY DAVID,

20:19.733 --> 20:21.233
AND HIS WIFE,
CHERYL.

20:21.267 --> 20:24.200
( exchanging greetings )

20:24.233 --> 20:25.800
HI, HOW YA
DOING, HI.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.233
MRS. DAVID,
A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

20:27.267 --> 20:29.800
IT IS SO NICE TO MEET YOU,
THANK YOU, SO MUCH.

20:29.833 --> 20:32.400
WE'VE HAD QUITE
A TIME TONIGHT,

20:32.433 --> 20:33.467
AND I REALLY
APPRECIATE YOU.

20:33.500 --> 20:34.700
IT'S SO NICE OF
YOU TO DO THIS,

20:34.733 --> 20:35.867
WE APPRECIATE IT
SO MUCH.

20:35.900 --> 20:38.233
I'M GLAD I COULD
BE OF HELP, NO PROBLEM.

20:38.267 --> 20:39.600
LET'S GO TAKE
A LOOK AT THAT.

20:39.633 --> 20:42.567
AND, AGAIN,
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT,

20:42.600 --> 20:43.633
GOD ALMIGHTY, I CAN'T
BELIEVE I SAID THAT.

20:43.667 --> 20:45.300
I THINK I MIGHT
HAVE OVERREACTED.

20:45.333 --> 20:46.700
NO, I DON'T
THINK SO,

20:46.733 --> 20:48.133
IT WAS COMPLETELY
IDIOTIC, REALLY.

20:48.167 --> 20:50.767
JUSTIN, WHAT
DID HE SAY ?

20:50.800 --> 20:51.767
UH...

20:51.800 --> 20:53.367
WE'D LIKE
TO HEAR IT.

20:53.400 --> 20:56.000
LARRY, THIS IS
PROFESSOR ROGET,

20:56.033 --> 20:58.900
FROM CAL-TECH PHYSICS.

20:58.933 --> 21:00.567
WHAT WAS SAID,
WE'D LIKE TO HEAR IT.

21:00.600 --> 21:02.067
WE'D LIKE TO KNOW.

21:02.100 --> 21:04.267
BELIEVE ME, YOU DON'T
WANNA HEAR THIS.

21:04.300 --> 21:06.600
( male )
WHAT IS IT, WE'D
LOVE TO HEAR IT.

21:06.633 --> 21:07.733
WHY NOT ?

21:07.767 --> 21:09.367
WHAT ?
YOU'RE KIDDING.

21:09.400 --> 21:11.567
COME ON, IT WAS NOTHING,
BELIEVE ME, IT WAS NOTHING.

21:11.600 --> 21:14.067
YOU'RE HAVING
A NICE PARTY HERE.

21:14.067 --> 21:17.233
EAT, YOU GOT
PEANUTS AND COOKIES.

21:17.267 --> 21:19.167
YOU'RE PROBABLY HAVING A VERY
STIMULATING CONVERSATION

21:19.200 --> 21:21.467
UNTIL WE CAME IN,
SO, BELIEVE ME,

21:21.500 --> 21:23.367
MY ADVICE TO YOU,
GO BACK, BECAUSE...

21:23.400 --> 21:27.567
( female )
LARRY, LARRY, LARRY,

21:27.600 --> 21:29.267
YOU'RE APOLOGIZING.

21:29.300 --> 21:31.667
APOLOGIZING
FOR NOTHING ?

21:34.300 --> 21:37.500
I WISH IT WAS SOMETHING,
I WISH IT WAS SOMETHING.

21:37.533 --> 21:39.867
I AM APOLOGIZING FOR
PRETTY MUCH NOTHING.

21:39.900 --> 21:42.367
IT IS NOTHING,
IT'S SO UNIMPORTANT.

21:42.400 --> 21:44.733
OH, COME ON,
LARRY, PLEASE,
SHARE WITH US.

21:44.767 --> 21:47.233
( professor )
COME ON, SPIT
IT OUT, LARRY.

21:47.267 --> 21:51.500
IT SOUNDS
INTERESTING.

21:51.533 --> 21:54.700
I'LL MAKE A DEAL
WITH YOU FOLKS, OKAY ?

21:54.733 --> 21:56.833
WE'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT WAS,
AND THEN WE CAN MOVE ON.

21:56.867 --> 22:00.333
( all in agreement )

22:00.367 --> 22:01.867
( Donna )
ALRIGHT, LARRY.

22:01.900 --> 22:05.300
( female )
COME ON, SHARE WITH US !

22:05.333 --> 22:07.200
LET US HEAR
ABOUT IT.

22:09.900 --> 22:13.267
I WAS WALKING ALONG,
WITH MY FRIEND,

22:13.300 --> 22:15.800
NEAR THE BEACH
IN SANTA MONICA,

22:15.833 --> 22:18.900
AND DR. GRAMBS
COMES JOGGING BY,

22:18.933 --> 22:21.267
AND, HE'S IN VERY
GOOD SHAPE, THIS MAN,

22:21.300 --> 22:24.433
BY THE WAY,
VERY GOOD SHAPE.

22:24.467 --> 22:25.600
( female )
COME ON, LET'S NOT BEAT
AROUND THE BUSH.

22:25.633 --> 22:27.800
COME ON,
LET'S GO.

22:30.733 --> 22:32.433
WELL...

22:36.433 --> 22:38.833
I SAID, UM...

22:38.867 --> 22:42.167
WHEN HE INTRODUCED ME
TO DR. GRAMBS,

22:42.200 --> 22:45.700
HE TOLD ME THAT HE'S A PATIENT
OF DR. GRAMBS, AND I SAID,

22:45.733 --> 22:48.067
"YOU LET HIM
WORK ON YOU

22:48.067 --> 22:50.433
EVEN WITH THE WHOLE
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION THING ?"

22:55.067 --> 22:56.733
( nervous laughter )

22:59.067 --> 23:00.900
YOU KNOW,
'CAUSE...

23:00.933 --> 23:04.267
IT WAS A JOKE, I'M JUST,
IT WAS A BAD JOKE.

23:04.300 --> 23:06.433
I WAS TRYING TO BE
TOO AFFABLE.

23:06.467 --> 23:09.200
I WENT OVERBOARD
IN MY AFFABILITY.

23:09.233 --> 23:11.533
ARE YOU IN FAVOR OF
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION ?

23:11.567 --> 23:13.067
COMPLETELY IN FAVOR OF IT,
ARE YOU KIDDING ?

23:13.067 --> 23:15.200
I DON'T THINK WHITE PEOPLE
SHOULD HAVE ANYTHING !

23:15.233 --> 23:17.500
I THINK WE SHOULD BE
SLEEPING ON THE STREET

23:17.533 --> 23:19.833
EATING CRUMBS,
AND WE SHOULD BE THAT WAY

23:19.867 --> 23:20.933
FOR A COUPLE
OF HUNDRED YEARS

23:20.967 --> 23:22.600
AND I'M NOT EVEN
JOKING ABOUT THAT.

23:22.633 --> 23:24.533
AND, GUYS, I'VE LEARNED
THAT HE'S A COMEDIAN,

23:24.567 --> 23:25.933
HE MAKES FUNNY LINES
ALL THE TIME,

23:25.967 --> 23:27.300
I OVERREACTED.

23:27.333 --> 23:28.600
AND HE KNOCKED IT OFF
THE TOP OFF HIS HEAD.

23:28.633 --> 23:30.867
HE'S MUCH BETTER WHEN
HE HAS A CHANCE TO WRITE IT

23:30.900 --> 23:32.600
AND LOOK IT OVER.

23:32.633 --> 23:34.900
SO, MAYBE HE'S LEARNED
A LESSON FROM ALL THIS ?

23:34.933 --> 23:36.667
YEAH, YOU CAN
SAY THAT AGAIN.

23:36.700 --> 23:39.067
I WAS ABOUT TO
SAY "SISTER", BUT...

23:41.467 --> 23:44.133
OKAY, EVERYONE,
SO, PLEASE, MRS. DAVID,

23:44.167 --> 23:45.233
LET ME TAKE A LOOK
AT THAT ARM, PLEASE.

23:45.267 --> 23:47.600
AH, THANK YOU,
YES, OKAY.

23:47.633 --> 23:51.600
LARRY DAVID,
MR. LARRY DAVID.

23:51.633 --> 23:54.067
TWICE IN ONE EVENING,
I'M ON A ROLL.

23:54.067 --> 23:56.067
MY FRIENDS,
THIS IS LARRY DAVID,

23:56.067 --> 23:59.800
THE MAN WHO REFUSED TO HIRE
A SISTER FOR A JOB

23:59.833 --> 24:01.700
FOR WHICH I WAS
CLEARLY QUALIFIED,

24:01.733 --> 24:03.867
BECAUSE HE'S A RACIST,
A BONA FIDE RACIST,

24:03.900 --> 24:05.667
WHO PREFERRED NOT TO WORK
WITH ANY BLACK PEOPLE

24:05.700 --> 24:07.167
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES,

24:07.200 --> 24:08.300
AND GIVES ALL
THE GOOD JOBS

24:08.333 --> 24:10.733
TO HIS WHITE WIFE'S
WHITE FRIENDS.

24:10.767 --> 24:12.600
GOOD EVENING.

24:28.467 --> 24:29.700
I THINK YOU BETTER
CALL THE DOCTOR.

24:29.733 --> 24:32.133
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO CALL
THE DOCTOR ON THE WEEKEND.

24:32.167 --> 24:35.067
I DON'T THINK
WE HAVE A CHOICE,

24:35.067 --> 24:36.267
I THINK WE
HAVE TO CALL HIM.

24:36.300 --> 24:41.067
WE'RE OUT OF OPTIONS,
REALLY, COME ON.

24:41.067 --> 24:43.600
ALRIGHT, I'M GONNA CALL HIM,
I'M GONNA PAGE HIM.

24:46.067 --> 24:48.167
OH, WAIT, SO WHAT
NUMBER DO I PUT IN ?

24:48.200 --> 24:50.067
PUT IN OUR HOME NUMBER,
WE'LL BE HOME IN A MINUTE.

24:50.067 --> 24:51.567

24:53.433 --> 24:55.067
ALRIGHT,
HE'S PAGED,
THAT'S IT.

24:55.100 --> 24:56.133
GREAT.

24:56.167 --> 24:57.900
IT'S DONE.

24:57.933 --> 24:59.333
OH, GOD !

24:59.367 --> 25:00.867
WHAT'S HE GONNA DO, WHAT'S
THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN ?

25:00.900 --> 25:02.067
I DON'T KNOW.

25:02.100 --> 25:03.367
WHAT'S HE GONNA DO,
KILL US ?

25:03.400 --> 25:06.667

25:09.567 --> 25:11.567

25:27.233 --> 25:28.267
( phone ringing )

25:28.300 --> 25:29.533
HELLO ?

25:29.567 --> 25:31.233
DAD, I CAN'T TALK
TO YOU RIGHT NOW !

25:31.267 --> 25:32.467
NO, I'LL CALL

25:45.333 --> 25:48.567

25:54.167 --> 25:57.133

ANOTHER ONE RIGHT AWAY.

25:57.167 --> 25:59.733
A LIFE THREATENING EMERGENCY ?

25:59.767 --> 26:02.767
YOU COULD SCRATCH
YOURSELF TO DEATH !

26:02.800 --> 26:04.467
I COULD SCRATCH
MYSELF TO DEATH

26:04.500 --> 26:07.067
IF IT GOES UNTREATED,
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW,

26:07.067 --> 26:11.067
IT THE LONGS DRUGSTORE
ON THE WESTSIDE.

26:11.067 --> 26:12.300
THANK YOU.

26:12.333 --> 26:13.833
NO, I WON'T EVER CALL YOU
ON THE WEEKEND AGAIN,

26:13.867 --> 26:15.067
THANK YOU, SO MUCH.

26:15.067 --> 26:16.467
WON'T EVER CALL YOU
ON THE WEEKEND ?

26:16.500 --> 26:18.767
OH, MY GOD, WHAT
A JERK THIS GUY IS.

26:18.800 --> 26:20.300
AT LEAST WE GOT IT,

26:20.333 --> 26:22.100
GET YOURSELF A NEW DOCTOR,
THIS GUY'S AN IDIOT.

26:22.133 --> 26:23.133
ALRIGHT, I'M GONNA
GO PICK IT UP.

26:23.167 --> 26:24.233
DO YOU WANT ME
