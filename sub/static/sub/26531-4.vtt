19:09.880 --> 19:11.797
- Do you think you want
to have kids?

19:11.880 --> 19:14.047
- You know, it's this thing
where, like,

19:14.130 --> 19:15.630
me and my Ben,
we'd have to like,

19:15.713 --> 19:17.296
win a Grammy
or get best new music

19:17.380 --> 19:19.547
on Pitchfork or something
before I'd feel comfortable

19:19.630 --> 19:21.130
dedicating my life
to another person,

19:21.213 --> 19:23.630
but that could be next year,
or it could be when I'm 46.

19:23.713 --> 19:25.839
Like, I don't know.
- Wait, 46?

19:25.922 --> 19:27.880
But what--what if
you can't have kids

19:27.964 --> 19:30.588
when you're 46?
What then?

19:30.672 --> 19:34.005
Because your biological age
may be 46,

19:34.089 --> 19:36.171
but depending on lifestyle,
your eggs

19:36.255 --> 19:38.672
could actually be
much older.

19:38.755 --> 19:40.005
Just--it just depends.
You do seem like

19:40.089 --> 19:42.171
you like to go hard,
as they say.

19:42.255 --> 19:44.547
[soft laughter]
- Well, I'm 44,

19:44.630 --> 19:47.005
and I'm still deciding.
- Oh, yeah, but I think

19:47.089 --> 19:49.338
your womb probably
decided for you.

19:49.421 --> 19:52.171
I always joke with Carleen
that I should have been given

19:52.255 --> 19:54.547
her uterus because she was
never gonna use it.

19:54.630 --> 19:56.505

Am I right?

19:56.588 --> 20:00.005
[laughs]

20:00.089 --> 20:02.964
Guys, let's play another game.

20:03.047 --> 20:04.880
[singsongy]
Let's do it, do it to it.

20:04.964 --> 20:06.839
Let's really think about it.

20:06.922 --> 20:09.005
I wanna play something fun.
[laughs]

20:09.089 --> 20:10.839
I am so amped!

20:10.922 --> 20:12.839
I'm not gonna lie.
I took a pill.

20:12.922 --> 20:14.338
- Oh, my God,
do you have Molly?

20:14.421 --> 20:16.089
- No, I don't know--
I don't know what it was.

20:16.171 --> 20:17.630
It's giving me some
raging diarrhea, but I'm good.

20:17.713 --> 20:20.255
I'm here, ready to rock it.
- You, uh--

20:20.338 --> 20:23.213
you know what, actually,
Kathryn?

20:23.296 --> 20:24.588
I think we're gonna call it.

20:24.672 --> 20:26.755
I think we're gonna turn in.
- No.

20:26.839 --> 20:27.839
No!

20:27.922 --> 20:29.880
No!
- It's pretty late.

20:29.964 --> 20:31.171
- And I gotta get back early.

20:31.255 --> 20:33.171
And if I'm late,
the nanny is so cunty,

20:33.255 --> 20:34.880
and not in a good way.

20:34.964 --> 20:36.380
- I can pack you.

20:36.463 --> 20:37.922
Let me pack you.
- You know what? I'm good.

20:38.005 --> 20:40.005
I actually got all this
disposable shit at Zara.

20:40.089 --> 20:42.047
I'm just gonna throw it
in a trash bag and peace out.

20:42.130 --> 20:43.839
- Mm, but we can't be done.

20:43.922 --> 20:46.047
It's too much fun!

20:46.130 --> 20:47.880
Come on!

20:47.964 --> 20:49.380
Let's do one more game.

20:49.463 --> 20:51.047
How about Truth or Dare?
Let's do Truth or Dare.

20:51.130 --> 20:53.255
Give me truth or dare.
Say it. Say, "Truth or dare?"

20:53.338 --> 20:54.547
- Truth or dare?
- Truth.

20:54.630 --> 20:55.839
[laughs]
- Um...

20:55.922 --> 20:57.255
- What's it gonna be?
- Oh, darn.

20:57.338 --> 20:58.630
- [sighs]
- Oh, no.

20:58.713 --> 21:00.338
- Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

21:00.421 --> 21:03.005
- What's your biggest secret?
- My biggest secret is

21:03.089 --> 21:05.755
that Nina-Joy
cheated on George!

21:05.839 --> 21:07.421
Did you guys know that?

21:07.505 --> 21:10.547
Not just second base,
third base--full-on.

21:10.630 --> 21:11.964
- Okay, number one,
that's mean.

21:12.047 --> 21:14.171
Number two, it's supposed
to be about you.

21:14.255 --> 21:16.255
- I don't have any secrets.
But Nina-Joy--

21:16.338 --> 21:19.463
this went on for months
before George found out.

21:19.547 --> 21:21.089
It was a-mazing.

21:21.171 --> 21:23.964
I was the person that she told,
and so I held on to it

21:24.047 --> 21:25.463
and held on to it,
and then finally

21:25.547 --> 21:27.755
I was just like, "We've gotta
talk about this."

21:27.839 --> 21:29.588
- I'm getting
really stressed out.

21:29.672 --> 21:31.296
Am I insane?
- You're not insane.

21:31.380 --> 21:34.797
- A black hole in the room.
- Kathryn, we need to sleep.

21:34.880 --> 21:35.964
- I don't.
- Bye.

21:36.047 --> 21:37.505
- Bye.
Good night, you guys.

21:37.588 --> 21:39.672
Good night, good night.
- Allison, I know what.

21:39.755 --> 21:41.130
Do you want to get
a quick pic

21:41.213 --> 21:42.797
for our Insta stories?
- Oh, no, I'm good.

21:42.880 --> 21:44.588
I'm good, sweetie, yeah.
I'm trying to keep my page

21:44.672 --> 21:47.255

- What even was that?

22:08.463 --> 22:11.588
- That, my friends,
is Kathryn McSorley-Jodell.

22:11.672 --> 22:13.964
- Just walk with me, please.
- You know what?

22:14.047 --> 22:15.047
Let go of me.

22:15.130 --> 22:16.463
I gotta get to a bathroom.

22:16.547 --> 22:17.713
Whatever this drug is
turned my stomach

22:17.797 --> 22:20.005
to a bag of water.

22:20.130 --> 22:21.964
- I didn't even ask
what you do.

22:22.047 --> 22:23.880
Like, what does Joe do?
- Oh.

22:23.964 --> 22:26.255

22:26.338 --> 22:29.089

- Cool.

22:48.463 --> 22:50.672
Okay, by the way...
- Yeah.

if you're not into this,

that you're going through--

22:55.964 --> 22:59.089

I thought I'd mention it.

22:59.171 --> 23:01.588
I'm a Reiki healer.

- Ableists.

24:29.922 --> 24:33.130
They judged me
because of my surgery.

24:33.213 --> 24:35.130
- I don't think
it was about the surgery.

24:35.213 --> 24:37.463
I think you're acting odd.
- Yeah.

24:37.547 --> 24:38.797

24:48.380 --> 24:51.713

about my uterus?

24:51.797 --> 24:53.171
- It's true.

24:53.255 --> 24:55.964
You did waste what seems,
for all intents and purposes,

24:56.047 --> 24:57.672
to be a perfectly good uterus.

24:57.755 --> 25:01.130
