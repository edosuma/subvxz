WEBVTT

00:46.131 --> 00:49.342
THE WAGES OF FEAR

02:26.064 --> 02:28.942
Shaved ice!

02:29.108 --> 02:34.823
Lemon, vanilla, coffee, horchata!

02:47.293 --> 02:50.046
Alms for the poor, sir.

03:05.812 --> 03:08.398
You should use some bleach
on that dark skin of yours.

03:08.565 --> 03:11.276
I'll bleach that tongue of yours!

03:11.442 --> 03:14.320
Come on, Perla.
Show me what you've got.

03:14.487 --> 03:17.532
You're asking too much, wise guy.

03:17.699 --> 03:19.284
Fine. Keep it then.

03:19.450 --> 03:22.537
What a disgrace!

04:02.827 --> 04:04.579
I hate mutts!

04:04.746 --> 04:06.331
Who asked you?

04:13.546 --> 04:15.882
Listen, doc,
no one asked your opinion.

04:57.048 --> 04:59.133
Some guys have all the luck.

04:59.842 --> 05:02.303
I wouldn't mind a job like that.

05:02.470 --> 05:05.598
It's for voters only.
Got your card?

05:14.524 --> 05:17.819
Godforsaken land. Never thought
I'd be begging for work.

05:17.986 --> 05:19.988
There's never work for tramps.

05:22.991 --> 05:25.493
Well, what'll you have?

05:33.084 --> 05:35.336
Make up your minds.
What do you feel like?

05:35.503 --> 05:36.671
A soda.

05:36.838 --> 05:39.007
One soda for the bunch of you?

05:39.173 --> 05:40.758
Get it and leave us alone!

05:40.925 --> 05:43.970
You think I'm here
to wait on you hand and foot!

05:44.512 --> 05:47.265
Rosa, a soda for the doctor.

05:47.432 --> 05:50.184
Right away, sir.

06:22.050 --> 06:23.926
You're asking for it!

06:25.386 --> 06:27.597
There's so little
to entertain us here.

06:28.347 --> 06:30.516
If it wasn't for this heat —

06:33.561 --> 06:38.191
What are we hanging
around here for?

06:40.318 --> 06:42.820
- You coming tonight?
- Maybe.

06:42.987 --> 06:45.073
You got them?
- In the flour sack.

06:49.494 --> 06:50.745
Give me a kiss.

06:53.164 --> 06:55.083
Hey, watch the clothes!

06:55.249 --> 06:56.834
Linda, come here!

06:58.419 --> 07:00.463
At the flour again, eh?

07:00.630 --> 07:02.173
Don't I feed you?

07:02.340 --> 07:04.926
I didn't eat your flour.

07:05.093 --> 07:07.011
Caught in the act!

07:07.178 --> 07:08.638
I'll show you!

07:08.805 --> 07:09.806
Forget it.

07:09.972 --> 07:11.557
Mind your own business.

07:11.724 --> 07:13.601
He's itching for trouble.

07:13.768 --> 07:15.353
You got some objection?

07:15.520 --> 07:18.731
You're just a pack of tramps.

07:20.608 --> 07:22.735
All you do is loaf around

07:23.277 --> 07:26.906
and scare away the customers.

07:27.657 --> 07:29.158
Scram or I'll call the cops.

07:29.325 --> 07:31.077
You squealer.

07:31.244 --> 07:33.538
They may be interested
in your papers.

07:33.704 --> 07:34.789
You'd turn us in?

07:34.956 --> 07:37.792
I'm a citizen here,
not a lousy foreigner.

07:37.959 --> 07:40.545
A real credit to the white race!

07:46.843 --> 07:48.594
What are you waiting for?

07:48.761 --> 07:50.221
Did you hear me?

07:50.388 --> 07:51.806
Beat it!

07:52.807 --> 07:54.475
If I ever hear

07:54.642 --> 07:56.602
that you even touched
a hair on her head —

07:56.769 --> 07:59.939
Me? I wouldn't hurt her.

08:01.482 --> 08:03.484
On the contrary.

08:03.651 --> 08:06.737
I only want to do her good.
Don't I, baby?

08:08.489 --> 08:11.075
Go to my room.
I'll be right up.

08:11.659 --> 08:13.077
Yes, sir.

08:14.704 --> 08:16.164
Leave that.

08:21.460 --> 08:23.504
You and your tricks!

08:23.671 --> 08:26.090
Clear out of here,
you lousy bum!

08:26.257 --> 08:29.010
Cheap tramp!

08:29.177 --> 08:30.887
Take it easy!

08:31.053 --> 08:33.222
- Get lost!
- You don't own the street.

08:33.389 --> 08:35.140
Stay out here, then.

08:35.308 --> 08:38.895
In the morning you can take a stroll
down to immigration.

08:39.061 --> 08:40.897
Dirty rat! Louse!

08:41.063 --> 08:42.732
Your insults go in one ear —

08:47.028 --> 08:48.571
You going up or not?

08:54.827 --> 08:56.913
Where's that lazy hooligan?

08:57.955 --> 08:59.123
Right here.

08:59.290 --> 09:02.043
The mail!
Didn't you hear the plane?

09:02.210 --> 09:04.462
You should already be
at the airport!

09:04.712 --> 09:06.714
Hurry up!

09:06.881 --> 09:09.926
You'll drive me out of business!

09:11.177 --> 09:13.888
- What's this?
- Can I go with you?

09:14.055 --> 09:15.640
Move over, quick.

09:50.466 --> 09:53.094
One day I'll find the right pilot.

09:53.261 --> 09:56.764
He'll let me ride with the baggage.

09:56.931 --> 09:59.225
I'll show him my US visa.

09:59.392 --> 10:02.103
It's authentic.
Did I ever show it to you?

10:02.687 --> 10:05.439
To me and everyone else —
a bad mistake.

10:05.773 --> 10:09.235
Some guys might get ideas.
Put it away.

10:17.910 --> 10:20.454
<i>Attention, please.</i>

10:20.621 --> 10:22.790
<i>Everyone clear the field.</i>

10:23.541 --> 10:28.754
<i>The International Airlines
flight from the capital</i>

10:28.921 --> 10:31.632
<i>is now landing
on runway number one.</i>

10:31.799 --> 10:37.305
<i>All passengers
please proceed to customs.</i>

10:40.349 --> 10:41.809
Hi, Pepito. What's new?

10:42.893 --> 10:46.772
Listen, boss,
I've got a passport.

11:18.179 --> 11:19.430
Your papers.

11:22.099 --> 11:23.099
Next.

11:34.070 --> 11:35.196
Next.

11:39.075 --> 11:40.534
Step around.

11:43.412 --> 11:44.872
Any baggage?

11:45.790 --> 11:46.790
No.

11:47.208 --> 11:50.211
- And no passport either, eh?
- Yes, I have one.

11:54.590 --> 11:56.467
What brings you here?

11:57.218 --> 11:58.969
I don't know yet.

12:11.857 --> 12:13.776
We'll put down "tourist."

12:29.041 --> 12:31.460
- What's the problem?
- A traffic jam.

12:31.627 --> 12:34.422
Tito! Come on!

12:34.588 --> 12:37.258
Come on, now!

12:37.425 --> 12:39.552
The lady and the child.

12:40.094 --> 12:42.096
That's right.

12:42.263 --> 12:44.849
Smile.
Don't move, please.

12:58.737 --> 13:01.198
Hey, that'll be a dollar.

13:01.365 --> 13:04.660
Wait. I may not stop here.

13:08.414 --> 13:11.834
Alms for the poor?

13:46.327 --> 13:48.162
You want an autograph or what?

14:12.102 --> 14:13.103
You French?

14:13.687 --> 14:18.734
A pleasure running into someone
like you, kid, 'cause frankly —

14:21.695 --> 14:24.323
- Where you from?
- Paris, rue des Pyrénées.

14:24.490 --> 14:26.033
I'm from Propriano.

14:26.200 --> 14:27.618
Ah, a Corsican.

14:27.785 --> 14:29.495
But I used to work in Paris.

14:29.662 --> 14:31.413
They pay us too, you know.

14:32.665 --> 14:35.709
Swell! This won't be
as bad as I thought.

14:35.876 --> 14:38.003
You just come from Tegucigalpa?

14:38.170 --> 14:39.421
Could be.

14:41.340 --> 14:43.384
Give me the lowdown.

14:43.551 --> 14:46.178
I'm dead broke.

14:46.887 --> 14:48.305
Anything doing here?

14:48.472 --> 14:52.142
Let's try the saloon.
Hernández isn't a bad guy.

14:52.309 --> 14:53.727
Is it far?

14:57.982 --> 15:01.402
Let's take the taxi.
It'll look better.

15:02.236 --> 15:03.654
The Corsair.

15:20.838 --> 15:24.091
Hey, boss.
I brought a pal along.

15:24.258 --> 15:26.969
Haven't you screwed me over
enough?

15:27.136 --> 15:28.262
Wait a minute!

15:28.429 --> 15:31.724
A sight for sore eyes.

15:32.266 --> 15:36.186
Hi, buddy.
Pay the taxi.

15:38.772 --> 15:42.109
- Who is this guy?
- I thought he was your pal.

15:43.402 --> 15:45.821
- You know him?
- By reputation.

15:52.870 --> 15:54.288
Come along, kid.

15:55.205 --> 15:57.416
Set one up for my pal too.

15:58.125 --> 15:59.543
Sit down.

15:59.710 --> 16:03.797
- Much obliged, sir.
- Don't start with the formalities now.

16:03.964 --> 16:06.592
You can call me Jo.

16:07.301 --> 16:09.303
But to the others,

16:09.928 --> 16:11.889
I'm Mr. Jo.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.140
Get it?

16:16.268 --> 16:18.979
Here's to you, Jo.

16:19.146 --> 16:20.146
Cheers.

16:24.902 --> 16:27.905
It'll all work out.
Don't worry.

16:28.781 --> 16:30.574
Not a bad joint.

16:30.741 --> 16:32.743
You get tired of it.

16:32.910 --> 16:36.080
It's none of my business,
but how'd you ever pick this dump?

16:36.664 --> 16:38.749
You don't always get a choice.

16:39.208 --> 16:42.336
I had to beat it fast.
Couldn't even get to the bank.

16:42.920 --> 16:44.755
I hightailed it to the airport,

16:44.922 --> 16:48.175
emptied my pockets
and said, "Give me a $50 ticket."

16:48.759 --> 16:50.344
And here I am.

16:58.143 --> 16:59.895
This is Linda.
A sweet kid.

17:01.689 --> 17:03.315
So I see.

17:05.025 --> 17:07.944
Say something.
Be polite.

17:09.029 --> 17:11.448
She's nice,
but she's got no manners.

17:11.615 --> 17:13.032
She's half savage.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.285
I popped a button.
Go on, now.

17:19.373 --> 17:21.208
Get a load of the locals.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.462
That one fell right out of
a coconut tree.

17:28.882 --> 17:30.300
You had any chow?

17:31.176 --> 17:32.594
On the plane.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.930
The meal was included.

17:35.097 --> 17:37.224
Then pardon me
while I get some grub.

17:37.391 --> 17:38.934
Can't you get it here?

17:39.101 --> 17:43.355
No, I've got a place in town.
A man's gotta be independent.

17:44.231 --> 17:45.231
Of course.

17:45.399 --> 17:47.609
I won't be long.

17:52.406 --> 17:55.617
You see?
Didn't even have to look for it.

17:56.785 --> 17:57.785
Of course.

18:10.090 --> 18:11.508
Hey, pal!

18:11.675 --> 18:13.594
You been mixing cement today?

18:14.011 --> 18:15.763
I finished the framework.

18:15.929 --> 18:18.557
We got a new mixer.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.560
They might even give us a machine.

18:22.436 --> 18:24.229
You don't know
what I've been through.

18:25.898 --> 18:29.026
Say, you rob a bank?
Or is it your birthday?

18:29.276 --> 18:30.694
It was a present.

18:31.278 --> 18:35.032
Pasta again?
- Stop your grumbling.

18:35.532 --> 18:37.785
I'll make you a swell sauce.

18:37.951 --> 18:40.621
No time.
I'll eat it plain.

18:40.788 --> 18:43.373
I've got a date.
- With a woman?

18:43.624 --> 18:44.708
What woman?

18:44.958 --> 18:47.336
A man — a real one!

18:52.132 --> 18:53.132
There.

18:53.175 --> 18:55.636
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

19:02.059 --> 19:03.477
I'm thirsty.

19:04.895 --> 19:06.438
Got any money?

19:06.605 --> 19:08.190
Take it out of my back wages.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.400
Let's see.

19:11.735 --> 19:13.153
Poor guy.

19:16.198 --> 19:17.825
Two beers outside.

19:37.302 --> 19:38.887
You must have gulped it down.

19:39.054 --> 19:41.181
When I'm happy,
I have no appetite. Here.

19:41.348 --> 19:42.766
Thanks, kid.

19:43.475 --> 19:45.727
Just enjoying some good cognac.

19:46.645 --> 19:49.857
- They served you the best.
- I helped myself.

19:58.782 --> 20:01.702
- Allow me, milord.
- Cool it, kid.

20:08.709 --> 20:12.129
- Turn that off. I don't like music.
- Sorry.

20:44.745 --> 20:45.954
Hey!

20:47.539 --> 20:51.126
Turn that thing off.
It's driving me crazy.

21:03.972 --> 21:08.143
- You won't see us anymore.
- Out! Out!

21:08.310 --> 21:10.938
We won't set foot
in your place again.

21:11.855 --> 21:14.608
We're going someplace else.

21:15.275 --> 21:17.110
Go get some fresh air.

21:20.447 --> 21:22.366
A bunch of bellyachers!

21:22.950 --> 21:25.118
A bunch of bellyachers.

21:25.535 --> 21:26.954
Naturally.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.956
Not one of us here has any work.

21:29.706 --> 21:31.750
Just occasional odd jobs.

21:31.917 --> 21:34.962
Just enough to eat
and buy a drink.

21:35.128 --> 21:36.880
Why don't you clear out?

21:37.798 --> 21:40.008
I would if I could.

21:40.175 --> 21:41.885
This is no cage.
Plenty of space here.

21:42.052 --> 21:45.847
That's the trouble. It takes
too much effort to cross it.

21:46.014 --> 21:48.350
- Hit the rails.
- No trains here.

21:48.517 --> 21:51.812
- The highway?
- It ends at the oil wells.

21:51.979 --> 21:54.022
- A plane?
- Too expensive.

21:54.773 --> 21:57.150
Caracas is too close

21:57.317 --> 21:58.944
and too hot.

21:59.736 --> 22:02.447
Besides, it costs $300.

22:03.115 --> 22:04.700
You got that much?

22:05.617 --> 22:07.160
Me neither.

22:07.744 --> 22:09.579
And you need a visa.

22:09.997 --> 22:13.083
- That can be arranged.
- A real one?

22:13.500 --> 22:14.668
That too.

22:14.960 --> 22:18.588
That takes dough,
for dough you need a job,

22:18.839 --> 22:20.632
and there are no jobs here.

22:21.174 --> 22:22.174
Look.

22:22.843 --> 22:24.845
They started that building
two years ago

22:25.012 --> 22:26.596
but then just gave up.

22:27.556 --> 22:29.307
Can't blame 'em with this sun.

22:30.851 --> 22:32.853
It's like prison here.

22:33.020 --> 22:35.981
Easy to get in.
"Make yourself at home."

22:36.148 --> 22:39.484
But there's no way out, and if
you don't get out, you croak.

22:39.693 --> 22:43.363
- Well, I don't feel like croaking.
- Nobody does.

22:44.072 --> 22:45.449
But they do anyway.

22:45.866 --> 22:48.577
Here's the proof.
- He couldn't stand up anymore.

22:48.744 --> 22:50.829
Not with that fever.

22:50.996 --> 22:53.206
And it's not just
mosquitoes here.

22:53.373 --> 22:57.544
It's spiders too,
and critters that eat your liver.

22:58.086 --> 22:59.880
Even leprosy.

23:00.047 --> 23:03.133
Everyone checks their wrists
for spots in the morning.

23:03.842 --> 23:06.178
And that's just the small stuff.

23:06.344 --> 23:08.930
No, there's only
one real chronic sickness:

23:09.097 --> 23:10.097
hunger.

23:11.058 --> 23:13.685
That's what kills most of us.
But not them.

23:14.227 --> 23:15.896
That spot's for the yanks.

23:16.063 --> 23:18.690
- Americans here?
- You kidding?

23:18.857 --> 23:21.068
If there's oil around,
they're not far behind.

23:21.234 --> 23:23.361
SOC is their company.

23:23.528 --> 23:25.322
They've got a camp.

23:25.489 --> 23:27.157
They're organized:

23:27.324 --> 23:30.327
houses, cafeteria, cemetery,

23:30.494 --> 23:32.245
all prefabricated.

23:32.662 --> 23:35.916
O'Brien comes by once a week
to check on things.

23:36.083 --> 23:38.752
Bill O'Brien?

23:38.919 --> 23:40.337
A big guy?
- Know him?

23:40.504 --> 23:44.091
You kidding? We ran
contraband together back in '32.

23:44.257 --> 23:45.717
Sorry.

23:46.259 --> 23:47.594
That changes everything.

24:03.902 --> 24:06.488
When I need dough,
I get mean.

24:16.123 --> 24:18.708
You've got 900 miles of pipeline.

24:19.459 --> 24:21.795
That's fragile stuff.

24:21.962 --> 24:23.964
A little dynamite...

24:25.632 --> 24:27.425
makes a lot of noise.

24:28.802 --> 24:31.263
Just let the cops
try and pin it on me.

25:15.724 --> 25:19.394
- No go, eh?
- For now. But that'll change.

25:20.145 --> 25:22.397
There's gotta be dough
to nab around here somewhere.

25:22.564 --> 25:26.401
Better shoot for oil.
When that stops, everything stops.

25:27.235 --> 25:28.862
Look at that guy.

25:30.030 --> 25:31.823
They fired him.

25:32.365 --> 25:33.909
Look at him now.

25:40.665 --> 25:42.542
- Excuse me.
- Who's he?

25:42.709 --> 25:45.253
My pal Luigi.
A good guy.

25:45.921 --> 25:49.633
Haven't seen
much of you lately.

25:49.799 --> 25:53.261
If you only knew
how busy we are.

25:54.429 --> 25:55.513
Let's swap jobs.

25:56.890 --> 25:58.350
We work...

25:59.643 --> 26:01.061
with our brains.

26:01.645 --> 26:05.357
- How's the job?
- So-so. Could pay better.

26:06.066 --> 26:08.985
This guy's greedy as hell.
Never has enough.

26:09.152 --> 26:11.071
Earns two bucks,
squirrels one away.

26:11.238 --> 26:13.490
Have to.
I'm saving to go home.

26:14.783 --> 26:18.245
Sorry, this rat doesn't seem
to like us talking.

26:20.121 --> 26:23.291
See what I mean?
Got his nose to the grindstone.

26:23.458 --> 26:24.876
We share a room.

26:25.043 --> 26:29.923
He does all the ironing and cooking.
A terrific guy!

26:30.507 --> 26:31.925
A real chump.

26:40.016 --> 26:41.643
Why's your pal sore at me?

26:41.810 --> 26:43.895
It's only natural.

26:44.062 --> 26:46.648
He used to see a lot of me.

26:46.815 --> 26:49.693
Now I'm always with you,
and he's left high and dry.

26:49.859 --> 26:51.653
What a jerk.

26:54.072 --> 26:55.782
Now what?

26:55.949 --> 26:56.992
Look!

26:58.118 --> 26:59.202
Don't be afraid.

27:00.287 --> 27:01.705
Ugly critters here!

27:01.871 --> 27:03.665
Let's go get a haircut.

27:03.832 --> 27:06.793
- I just got one Saturday.
- Keep me company.

27:06.960 --> 27:08.169
It's just that —

27:09.212 --> 27:11.339
I've got a date with Linda.
It's her day off.

27:11.923 --> 27:13.800
Ah, sorry.
That changes everything.

27:14.384 --> 27:15.385
Very well.

27:15.552 --> 27:16.552
Sore at me?

27:18.096 --> 27:20.807
Who do you think you are?
Get a load of yourself.

27:20.974 --> 27:22.642
Wait, Jo!

27:24.352 --> 27:27.314
- Where are you going?
- I've got some business with Jo.

27:27.480 --> 27:31.609
Look at the pretty new dress
I made.

27:31.776 --> 27:33.320
It's this one.

27:33.486 --> 27:36.990
Exactly the same, isn't it?

27:37.574 --> 27:40.660
Very pretty.
But you'll ruin it by wearing it.

27:40.827 --> 27:43.121
- I'll make another.
- Coming or not?

27:44.664 --> 27:47.500
Won't you lend him to me,
Mr. Jo?

27:47.667 --> 27:50.337
One day a month
isn't much to ask.

27:50.837 --> 27:54.341
He's old enough
to decide for himself.

27:54.924 --> 27:57.385
- I'm coming.
- Too late!

27:59.262 --> 28:01.973
- Happy now?
- Beat me if you'd like.

28:02.515 --> 28:04.934
I don't know what stops me!

28:05.101 --> 28:08.188
Come on. If we gotta go out,
let's get going.

28:10.607 --> 28:12.192
And stop pouting!

28:14.527 --> 28:18.990
I'm in a bind, sir.
My visa expires in a month,

28:19.157 --> 28:20.950
and I don't have the fare.

28:21.701 --> 28:25.205
A hundred dollars
would save my life.

28:25.372 --> 28:26.998
Please help me out.

28:28.416 --> 28:32.212
I'll pay you back.
I'm from a good family.

28:33.171 --> 28:35.048
You're a decent man too.

28:35.882 --> 28:37.801
Beat it, kid.
You're bugging me.

28:41.471 --> 28:44.015
That'll teach you!

28:44.182 --> 28:45.558
You give her a piece of your mind?

28:45.725 --> 28:47.685
I can't take the nagging.

28:47.852 --> 28:49.938
Women are a waste of time
for guys like us.

28:59.239 --> 29:01.741
No luck.
This goes to the cleaners.

29:01.908 --> 29:03.868
What'll I wear in the meantime?

29:04.411 --> 29:07.789
I can't go around bare-assed —
not at my age.

29:08.248 --> 29:11.292
Don't worry.
We're well stocked here.

29:11.459 --> 29:12.459
Here.

29:13.211 --> 29:15.088
Wear a pair of Luigi's.

29:15.255 --> 29:16.965
Is this gangster here
Luigi's old man?

29:17.132 --> 29:18.967
Not bad, eh?

29:19.134 --> 29:21.136
Will these do?
- Let me see.

29:21.302 --> 29:22.512
Say,

29:23.096 --> 29:24.722
you see my museum?

29:24.931 --> 29:26.599
These are my pinups.

29:26.850 --> 29:30.103
Gives you something to think about
while pawing the savages here.

29:31.187 --> 29:33.940
And that's the treasure.

29:34.524 --> 29:36.109
The crown jewel.

29:37.777 --> 29:40.113
Get a load of this.

29:40.655 --> 29:43.867
No kidding.
I haven't seen one in years.

29:46.119 --> 29:47.412
Pigalle.

29:48.288 --> 29:49.914
Last ride I took.

29:50.081 --> 29:52.250
It took me to the train,
the train to the boat,

29:52.417 --> 29:53.877
and the boat got me here.

29:54.461 --> 29:56.588
A longer trip
than I bargained for.

29:57.130 --> 29:59.174
It used to cost a franc.

29:59.340 --> 30:02.093
But it costs $1,000 to get back!

30:02.260 --> 30:04.345
And the price keeps going up.

30:08.433 --> 30:09.976
I'll handle this.

30:15.315 --> 30:16.983
Hello, old buddy.

30:22.071 --> 30:25.200
Very nice.
Make yourself right at home.

30:25.366 --> 30:28.495
Those are my pants.
I worked hard for 'em.

30:28.661 --> 30:33.124
- What's he saying?
- Stop beefing. You'll get them back,

30:33.291 --> 30:35.126
all cleaned and disinfected.

30:35.293 --> 30:36.836
Ah, keep 'em.

30:37.003 --> 30:39.506
Give them to anyone you like.

30:39.672 --> 30:41.591
Cut it out, now.
We're not married.

30:41.758 --> 30:44.844
If you don't like it,
I'm clearing out.

30:45.011 --> 30:46.554
- What does he want?
- Nothing. He's nuts.

30:46.721 --> 30:48.306
Let's go before I get sore.

30:48.473 --> 30:50.350
That's it — get out!

30:50.517 --> 30:52.227
I won't miss you.

30:53.436 --> 30:55.855
See how I handled him?

30:57.190 --> 30:58.190
Wait.

31:02.195 --> 31:03.613
Couldn't leave this.

31:37.021 --> 31:38.565
- Guess what.
- What?

31:38.731 --> 31:40.692
- Luigi's on his way.
- Really?

31:41.651 --> 31:43.069
I'll go tell the others.

32:14.017 --> 32:17.228
- There's gonna be trouble.
- A real brawl.

32:29.282 --> 32:31.826
Good evening, Pepito.

32:33.202 --> 32:34.787
Getting married?

32:34.954 --> 32:36.706
I'm treating the gang.

32:36.873 --> 32:38.875
Drinks are on me, boys.

32:43.630 --> 32:45.798
- What will it be?
- Hey, you!

32:45.965 --> 32:48.509
Two whiskeys.
- Right away, Mr. Jo.

32:48.676 --> 32:51.095
I ordered first.

32:51.262 --> 32:53.139
Sure. Sodas for five?

32:53.306 --> 32:55.975
Sodas?
We're not broke!

32:56.142 --> 32:57.393
Champagne!

32:59.354 --> 33:01.481
Sparkling champagne!

33:03.816 --> 33:07.487
- Real champagne, Luigi?
- Of course.

33:07.654 --> 33:10.657
You're rich!
Can I have a taste?

33:10.823 --> 33:12.825
My pleasure.

33:12.992 --> 33:16.120
That's right.
Some music will cheer things up.

33:19.499 --> 33:21.501
Your buddy's getting
on my nerves.

33:24.128 --> 33:26.005
May I have the honor?

33:26.589 --> 33:28.174
It would be my pleasure.

34:09.882 --> 34:11.342
<i>Two for supper</i>

34:20.435 --> 34:22.395
<i>Two for supper</i>

34:41.246 --> 34:43.833
Waiter!
We're starving!

34:45.208 --> 34:46.208
Coming!

34:50.757 --> 34:51.882
Well?

34:56.012 --> 34:58.431
The gentleman has been served.

35:21.037 --> 35:22.371
What are you waiting for?

35:31.297 --> 35:32.924
I'm warning you.

35:33.466 --> 35:36.803
I can't afford to duke it out
like a dockhand.

35:36.969 --> 35:38.095
I'll shoot.

35:38.846 --> 35:40.598
Easy to show off with that.

35:46.020 --> 35:47.021
Here.

35:53.486 --> 35:54.529
Well, shoot.

35:58.866 --> 36:00.868
I can't do it just like that.

36:01.619 --> 36:03.287
How about like this?

36:27.854 --> 36:29.230
You don't look so good.

36:29.397 --> 36:32.441
A gun's not enough.
It takes guts.

36:32.608 --> 36:34.193
I'm not a killer.

36:37.530 --> 36:40.491
- Now, where's that whiskey?
- Right away.

36:40.658 --> 36:43.369
- You scared the shit out of me.
- That was nothing.

36:43.536 --> 36:46.664
Did you have to slap him?
It could have gotten ugly.

36:46.831 --> 36:50.209
That was just
to spice things up.

36:51.794 --> 36:55.882
<i>They came around with their money.
"To make you rich," they said.</i>

36:56.048 --> 36:59.051
<i>No! To ruin our lives!</i>

36:59.635 --> 37:02.054
<i>To send our boys to their death.</i>

37:02.805 --> 37:06.309
<i>And yesterday
a catastrophe happened.</i>

37:06.475 --> 37:08.561
<i>It's not fair.</i>

37:09.103 --> 37:10.980
<i>We're always the ones to suffer.</i>

37:11.606 --> 37:13.608
We're always the ones to die.

37:13.774 --> 37:15.234
She's right.

37:16.110 --> 37:19.071
The gringos never die!

37:20.364 --> 37:22.408
They kill my father
or your brother.

37:22.575 --> 37:24.827
They give you a handful of money,
and that's that.

37:24.994 --> 37:28.831
- That's right! They killed my brother!
- And my husband.

37:28.998 --> 37:31.709
Francisco lost a leg
in one of their machines!

37:31.876 --> 37:33.586
But they paid you.

37:33.753 --> 37:35.212
Practically nothing!

37:36.255 --> 37:38.257
What's going on, a revolution?

37:38.424 --> 37:41.510
An accident at an oil well
about 300 miles from here.

37:41.677 --> 37:43.930
It's been burning all night.

37:45.348 --> 37:48.225
Thirteen victims,
all from around here.

37:48.809 --> 37:50.937
The mountain's on fire.

37:51.103 --> 37:53.272
You can see the flames
from heaven itself.

37:53.439 --> 37:55.066
- Who's dead?
- No one knows.

37:55.232 --> 37:56.943
We have a right to know!

37:57.109 --> 37:58.569
Here they come!

42:40.226 --> 42:42.061
<i>Good pay.</i>

42:42.228 --> 42:44.897
<i>Apply at the SOC office.</i>

42:47.066 --> 42:49.944
This is the break
I've been waiting for!

42:51.737 --> 42:56.492
<i>Experienced drivers sought</i>

42:56.742 --> 42:58.911
<i>for dangerous work.</i>

42:59.078 --> 43:00.663
<i>Good pay.</i>

43:04.416 --> 43:05.960
You hear that?

43:06.126 --> 43:08.379
$2,000 a piece.

43:08.545 --> 43:11.590
In a week we'll be far away,
rolling in dough!

43:11.757 --> 43:15.803
And we'll remember
what a swell guy Hernández was!

43:41.662 --> 43:44.665
A little more.
Take a deep breath.

43:47.459 --> 43:49.086
Your lungs are full of cement.

43:49.962 --> 43:53.465
These spots here
are packed solid.

43:55.050 --> 43:57.636
Keep this up
and you won't last long.

43:58.387 --> 43:59.972
How long?

44:00.139 --> 44:04.435
- Six months, a year — maybe more.
- Maybe less.

44:08.939 --> 44:11.483
What should I do?
- Clear out immediately.

44:12.651 --> 44:15.362
- How can I?
- That's the question.

44:15.529 --> 44:17.823
<i>Seeking experienced drivers.</i>

44:18.574 --> 44:22.619
<i>Dangerous work.
Very good wages.</i>

45:07.206 --> 45:09.124
- What are you paying?
- $2,000.

46:44.136 --> 46:47.931
You mustn't go!
You'll be killed!

46:48.098 --> 46:50.767
Don't go with him!
It's dangerous!

46:50.934 --> 46:53.103
You'll all be killed!

47:27.095 --> 47:30.766
But I've got a visa. I drive well.
It's those bastards' fault.

47:30.933 --> 47:33.018
Who's up next?

47:35.270 --> 47:38.273
But I've got a visa. I drive well.
It's those bastards' fault.

47:38.857 --> 47:41.109
If anyone tries any tricks,

47:41.860 --> 47:44.279
I'll grab the first guy I see

47:45.030 --> 47:47.449
and smash his mug
on a roll bar!

47:48.033 --> 47:49.409
I'll kill myself.

47:49.576 --> 47:52.037
It'll be on your conscience.
I'll kill myself!

47:57.751 --> 47:59.711
And they're made of iron!

48:02.506 --> 48:03.924
That makes one.

48:13.308 --> 48:15.852
You drove like a pro.

48:16.019 --> 48:17.604
You were way better.

48:36.039 --> 48:37.457
I told you.

48:43.255 --> 48:45.090
What about me?

48:45.257 --> 48:46.883
Filthy tricks!

48:52.014 --> 48:54.266
He had 'em picked out beforehand.

48:54.433 --> 48:56.310
You could have just said so.

49:26.923 --> 49:31.178
- Come on.
- No, you go on ahead.

49:33.597 --> 49:36.350
Don't worry.
You and I'll manage fine.

49:39.144 --> 49:43.774
The show's over now.
You can stop playing big boss.

49:44.066 --> 49:47.110
It's just you and me now —
Bill and Jo —

49:47.319 --> 49:49.196
and we're gonna talk straight.

49:52.199 --> 49:55.118
Cut it out!
We've known each other too long.

49:55.285 --> 49:58.080
You know I can drive.
So what gives?

49:59.331 --> 50:02.501
You're too old, Jo,
and so am I.

50:03.251 --> 50:05.629
We're played out.

50:14.554 --> 50:16.515
Well, I don't feel old.

50:17.724 --> 50:21.269
One of those guys'll back out.
- We'll see.

50:21.436 --> 50:23.772
- Wanna bet?
- $2,000.

50:24.356 --> 50:27.943
If anyone backs out,
the job's yours.

50:29.361 --> 50:30.946
Now you're talking.

50:53.093 --> 50:55.971
Dear Mama, I found a job.

50:56.138 --> 51:00.308
If I don't write for a while,
don't worry.

51:00.475 --> 51:02.102
Love, Bernardo.

51:06.773 --> 51:11.194
One, two, three, four,
five, six, on the house!

51:11.361 --> 51:13.780
- Mud in your eye!
- To the millionaires!

51:15.073 --> 51:17.451
- Linda, please.
- Not now.

51:17.617 --> 51:19.244
Let him talk.

51:19.411 --> 51:21.037
It's very important.

51:22.080 --> 51:25.292
Please mail this
in the morning.

51:25.459 --> 51:28.295
Stop crying.
You'll go next time.

51:28.879 --> 51:30.714
Why act like this?
You're a man.

51:30.881 --> 51:33.508
You guys are men, not me.

51:36.094 --> 51:37.512
Where's Jo?

51:37.679 --> 51:41.224
He came in after you
and holed up in his room.

51:42.350 --> 51:46.938
He did his dirty work
and now he's hiding.

51:47.105 --> 51:49.691
You leave
while he stays behind.

51:55.864 --> 51:57.532
One more hour.

51:57.699 --> 52:00.952
That's enough!
Go bawl outside!

52:07.292 --> 52:09.753
An hour can be a long time.

52:36.696 --> 52:41.034
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

52:41.201 --> 52:43.829
Blessed art thou among women,

52:43.995 --> 52:47.165
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

52:47.332 --> 52:49.334
Holy Mary, mother of God,

52:49.501 --> 52:54.881
pray for us sinners.

53:04.015 --> 53:07.602
Quick! Everybody, come!

53:07.769 --> 53:08.979
Hurry!

53:09.145 --> 53:10.939
What's eating you?

53:11.106 --> 53:14.860
He's dead.
He hanged himself outside.

53:16.069 --> 53:17.069
Who, Jo?

53:17.112 --> 53:20.031
No, the kid.

53:20.198 --> 53:22.450
The Italian, Bernardo.

53:24.870 --> 53:27.622
Mr. O'Brien's first victim.

53:40.010 --> 53:42.178
We sure look classy.

53:44.055 --> 53:47.475
Can't kick off without a uniform.

53:47.642 --> 53:50.061
Even when they guillotine you,

53:51.146 --> 53:53.690
they dress you up first.

54:18.882 --> 54:21.092
It's not like him to be late.

54:21.259 --> 54:23.136
No, not him.

54:25.931 --> 54:28.058
I'll call the hotel just in case.

54:29.935 --> 54:30.935
Wait.

54:31.436 --> 54:32.896
Here he comes.

54:40.320 --> 54:41.947
Hello, boys.

54:42.322 --> 54:44.449
I came to see my pal off.

54:50.163 --> 54:52.332
What's the matter?

54:52.499 --> 54:54.250
Looks like a funeral.

54:54.793 --> 54:57.003
Did you happen
to see Smerloff?

54:57.587 --> 55:00.840
Why? Hasn't he shown up?

55:01.925 --> 55:03.969
That's irresponsible of him.

55:04.135 --> 55:06.471
Who saw him last?

55:06.638 --> 55:11.017
He had a drink with us,
and then he left with Jo.

55:12.811 --> 55:16.815
We had things to talk about.
Any law against that?

56:05.530 --> 56:07.866
Think we're making
a big mistake?

56:08.033 --> 56:10.535
- What's wrong?
- I'm scared stiff.

56:12.662 --> 56:14.914
Scared I won't have what it takes.

56:16.499 --> 56:19.627
Don't worry, kid.
I'll show you how it's done.

56:45.695 --> 56:47.197
Where's the stuff?

57:09.385 --> 57:10.804
They're off to dinner.

57:11.888 --> 57:14.808
Easy on the booze.
It's bad for the reflexes.

58:06.985 --> 58:09.445
- Heads or tails?
- What for?

58:24.669 --> 58:27.130
Makes no goddamn difference.

58:27.839 --> 58:29.841
Like hell it doesn't!

58:30.008 --> 58:31.426
Let's flip for it.

58:35.930 --> 58:37.849
Tails.
- Heads.

58:41.436 --> 58:42.854
I always lose.

58:43.021 --> 58:44.606
Talk about luck!

59:10.381 --> 59:12.800
- Shall we?
- Hold your horses.

59:13.676 --> 59:15.261
I'm not leaving just yet.

59:19.265 --> 59:20.725
Wait a minute.

59:25.605 --> 59:27.482
What's the pressure?

59:30.068 --> 59:31.486
Yeah, right.

59:32.070 --> 59:34.614
If anything goes wrong,
I'm the one who'll get it.

59:34.781 --> 59:36.449
So excuse me!

59:36.616 --> 59:38.076
Climb in, kid.

59:40.328 --> 59:43.623
Every minute you lose
costs dough!

59:47.168 --> 59:48.586
Light 'em up.

59:50.213 --> 59:51.631
Running lights.

59:53.258 --> 59:54.759
Headlights.

59:57.637 --> 59:59.264
Searchlights.

01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:02.600
All right.

01:00:06.271 --> 01:00:09.274
If you want to drive this heap,
go ahead.

01:00:10.191 --> 01:00:12.485
Are you the one
with the bomb on his tail?

01:00:12.652 --> 01:00:14.112
Then leave me alone.

01:00:21.869 --> 01:00:24.622
I brought you something, Jo.

01:00:25.832 --> 01:00:27.625
This is for you.

01:00:27.792 --> 01:00:29.210
You're crazy.

01:00:29.377 --> 01:00:30.795
Take it.

01:00:32.588 --> 01:00:36.175
- You sure?
- It's no good anymore anyway.

01:00:37.969 --> 01:00:39.220
Yeah, pal.

01:00:39.387 --> 01:00:41.180
Break a leg.

01:00:56.988 --> 01:00:59.407
Hey, didn't you fill the tank?

01:01:00.325 --> 01:01:01.909
The contact.

01:01:05.872 --> 01:01:07.332
It's okay now.

01:01:32.357 --> 01:01:34.192
Right — good luck!

01:01:34.442 --> 01:01:36.486
Coca-Cola! Some deal!

01:02:03.679 --> 01:02:05.390
He knows his stuff.

01:03:42.153 --> 01:03:45.656
Mario, my darling,
why are you doing this?

01:03:45.823 --> 01:03:48.201
I begged you not to go.

01:03:48.451 --> 01:03:53.623
I'd have robbed or killed

01:03:53.831 --> 01:03:55.333
to keep you by my side.

01:03:55.583 --> 01:03:58.961
You don't care if I'm unhappy.

01:03:59.837 --> 01:04:01.964
I hate you!
I despise you!

01:04:02.131 --> 01:04:04.175
Watch the bumps!

01:04:05.176 --> 01:04:06.802
Have pity on me, darling!

01:04:06.969 --> 01:04:09.222
That's enough!
Beat it, okay?

01:04:12.558 --> 01:04:16.229
Good-bye, my love.

01:04:16.812 --> 01:04:20.274
Promise you'll be careful.

01:04:20.441 --> 01:04:22.527
Promise you'll come back!

01:04:22.693 --> 01:04:23.903
Get lost, damn it!

01:05:15.413 --> 01:05:17.331
Made it this time.

01:05:17.498 --> 01:05:19.750
And next time too.
Stop worrying.

01:05:21.043 --> 01:05:22.587
Is it hot or cold?

01:05:22.753 --> 01:05:24.422
Hot. Why?

01:05:24.589 --> 01:05:26.507
I'm freezing.

01:05:26.674 --> 01:05:28.426
Want your sweater?

01:05:28.593 --> 01:05:30.011
Not now.

01:05:34.098 --> 01:05:35.516
Thanks, kid.

01:05:46.611 --> 01:05:48.195
Wipe my brow.

01:05:48.362 --> 01:05:49.905
Something wrong?

01:05:50.072 --> 01:05:51.657
I think I'm sick.

01:05:51.824 --> 01:05:54.910
- You got a fever?
- I'm shivering.

01:05:55.745 --> 01:05:57.872
A touch of malaria.

01:05:58.039 --> 01:05:59.457
We're off to a good start.

01:06:03.836 --> 01:06:05.296
Where are we?

01:06:06.422 --> 01:06:08.299
Two hundred yards from the bend.

01:06:09.175 --> 01:06:11.510
Only 300 miles to go.

01:06:34.367 --> 01:06:36.160
Hey, do you smell oil?

01:06:37.662 --> 01:06:39.205
No.

01:06:39.372 --> 01:06:43.000
Maybe the engine's hot.
We've been in second for an hour.

01:06:44.251 --> 01:06:46.879
Okay, let's let it
cool down a bit.

01:06:56.305 --> 01:06:59.558
- It's warm but not overheated.
- Better safe than sorry.

01:07:00.768 --> 01:07:04.438
I feel better now.
How about a bite?

01:07:05.022 --> 01:07:06.148
Already?

01:07:06.857 --> 01:07:08.651
We've only gone ten miles

01:07:09.443 --> 01:07:11.487
and we're already falling behind.

01:07:14.156 --> 01:07:18.411
They're expecting us, you know.
- We didn't punch any clock.

01:07:18.577 --> 01:07:20.329
I don't give a damn
about their oil.

01:07:20.496 --> 01:07:23.207
Think we'll get
year-end dividends?

01:07:29.463 --> 01:07:31.340
Come on, let's go!

01:07:31.549 --> 01:07:32.883
Are you nuts?

01:07:33.050 --> 01:07:34.050
Look!

01:07:36.887 --> 01:07:40.850
- Oh, God.
- Rest later. Let's move!

01:07:57.408 --> 01:08:01.370
Hear that?
Must be nice to have dough.

01:08:02.079 --> 01:08:03.539
It's funny.

01:08:03.706 --> 01:08:05.833
Yesterday we were
like other people,

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.210
just like everyone else.

01:08:08.377 --> 01:08:11.464
We had fun, we slept, we ate.

01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:14.425
We knew men and women.

01:08:16.135 --> 01:08:17.595
And now

01:08:18.554 --> 01:08:20.139
there's nobody.

01:08:21.515 --> 01:08:22.515
Just us two.

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:24.018
Two's enough.

01:08:24.185 --> 01:08:26.770
Enough to drive a truck.

01:08:26.937 --> 01:08:30.524
But I like to be with people.

01:08:32.276 --> 01:08:35.779
Sitting outside in the evening,
drinking wine

01:08:35.946 --> 01:08:37.656
and talking.
- About what?

01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:41.160
I don't know.
Whatever comes into my head.

01:08:41.743 --> 01:08:46.791
Then you take a girl into the corner,
give her a tickle.

01:08:48.751 --> 01:08:50.169
Don't you like women?

01:08:52.087 --> 01:08:55.299
You've had too easy a life.
- You think so?

01:08:56.133 --> 01:08:59.178
You were daddy's little boy.
What does your father do?

01:08:59.345 --> 01:09:00.970
I'm an orphan.

01:09:01.514 --> 01:09:03.224
How old are you?

01:09:04.767 --> 01:09:05.768
A hundred.

01:09:05.935 --> 01:09:08.395
A hundred? Come on!

01:09:08.562 --> 01:09:12.274
Just takes a few months
to get to be a hundred...

01:09:13.651 --> 01:09:18.113
if you're in the right place
at the right time.

01:09:19.657 --> 01:09:21.951
Not even time for coffee.

01:09:25.996 --> 01:09:30.709
- Feeling sick again?
- I don't like to be rushed.

01:09:32.711 --> 01:09:36.006
How am I supposed to hold that?
- With your hands.

01:09:37.591 --> 01:09:39.926
What if we get a flat?

01:09:40.094 --> 01:09:42.763
With new tires?
Come off it.

01:09:42.930 --> 01:09:44.390
It's happened.

01:09:44.974 --> 01:09:46.684
Want me to throw it out?

01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:48.685
Hold it up for me.

01:09:50.270 --> 01:09:53.524
That's right.
Drink it down, pops.

01:09:55.985 --> 01:09:57.528
What's the matter now?

01:10:02.366 --> 01:10:03.366
Take the wheel.

01:10:15.254 --> 01:10:17.172
I told you not to stuff your face!

01:10:39.653 --> 01:10:42.156
What happened?
Did you break down?

01:10:42.323 --> 01:10:44.241
He's sick.

01:10:44.825 --> 01:10:47.411
Sick? Him?

01:10:47.578 --> 01:10:49.455
He's drunk, or scared stiff.

01:10:49.622 --> 01:10:51.957
Jo, scared?
Go say that to his face.

01:10:52.541 --> 01:10:56.378
Damned right I will.
We're talking to you, big shot!

01:10:56.545 --> 01:10:58.923
- Up yours.
- Leave him alone.

01:10:59.089 --> 01:11:02.635
Relax, I won't steal him from you.

01:11:02.801 --> 01:11:05.387
Now get moving!
I'm not spending the night here!

01:11:05.971 --> 01:11:07.848
We'll move
when we're good and ready.

01:11:08.015 --> 01:11:10.851
We're not taking orders from you.

01:11:11.018 --> 01:11:13.187
And we're not stopping
every 10 miles.

01:11:14.104 --> 01:11:17.191
Forget it, kid.
Let 'em go ahead if they want to.

01:11:17.775 --> 01:11:20.527
Your orders were to stay
a half hour ahead of us.

01:11:20.694 --> 01:11:23.572
Forget it.
You saw how they drive.

01:11:24.114 --> 01:11:27.368
With them in the lead,
we'll crawl along like snails.

01:11:29.119 --> 01:11:30.329
Some drivers!

01:11:32.581 --> 01:11:33.999
A couple of lugs!

01:12:01.694 --> 01:12:04.822
We'll see how they like it
when things get tough.

01:12:04.989 --> 01:12:07.199
Why?
Does it get bad further on?

01:12:07.366 --> 01:12:11.161
It's okay until the corral.

01:12:11.328 --> 01:12:14.915
After that, the road gets ugly.

01:12:15.666 --> 01:12:18.293
You know what corrugated iron is?

01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:20.421
Yeah, you use it to cover a shack.

01:12:20.587 --> 01:12:24.174
That's what they call bad road here —
"the washboard."

01:12:24.341 --> 01:12:27.928
The wind blows ruts
into the road,

01:12:28.095 --> 01:12:30.681
and they shake the hell
out of the chassis.

01:12:31.390 --> 01:12:34.685
- The nitro could blow.
- Not if you go fast.

01:12:34.852 --> 01:12:38.814
At 40 miles an hour,
you fly over the bumps.

01:12:38.981 --> 01:12:41.191
But you have to keep
your speed up.

01:12:41.358 --> 01:12:43.861
Under 30, you start vibrating,

01:12:44.028 --> 01:12:45.863
and you're done for.

01:12:47.406 --> 01:12:48.991
How long is it like that?

01:12:49.158 --> 01:12:51.869
For about 20 miles
past the corral.

01:12:53.495 --> 01:12:54.913
Here's the corral.

01:12:55.998 --> 01:12:57.416
After that, the washboard.

01:12:57.583 --> 01:12:59.001
Pump six is in the middle.

01:12:59.168 --> 01:13:00.586
The Americans laid down
some concrete.

01:13:00.753 --> 01:13:04.339
Even there, you can't slow down.
No time to speed up again.

01:13:04.506 --> 01:13:06.675
You gotta stay at full speed.

01:13:06.842 --> 01:13:09.261
Or we can take it slow.

01:13:09.428 --> 01:13:12.014
You'll vibrate, man.
It's bad washboard.

01:13:12.181 --> 01:13:15.059
To be safe, we'd have to stay

01:13:15.225 --> 01:13:16.393
under six miles an hour.

01:13:16.602 --> 01:13:17.728
Okay.

01:13:17.895 --> 01:13:19.897
Let's take it slow.

01:13:20.064 --> 01:13:21.648
Are you nuts?

01:13:21.815 --> 01:13:24.651
Twenty miles
will take us four hours.

01:13:25.736 --> 01:13:29.406
After the bridge,
speed up to 40 miles an hour.

01:13:38.373 --> 01:13:39.373
30...

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.919
35...

01:13:42.961 --> 01:13:44.588
40.

01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:49.968
Here's the corral.

01:14:01.730 --> 01:14:04.399
That's it.
Make those tires sing

01:14:04.566 --> 01:14:05.984
and don't stop!

01:14:13.534 --> 01:14:15.244
You hear that?

01:14:23.627 --> 01:14:25.129
It's okay now.

01:14:25.295 --> 01:14:27.381
Are you sure?
Could be water in the gas tank.

01:14:27.548 --> 01:14:30.300
- Don't even say that.
- We're on the bad road.

01:14:30.467 --> 01:14:33.887
If it's the engine, we're fucked.

01:14:36.098 --> 01:14:37.516
Time to go.

01:14:39.017 --> 01:14:41.186
Let me finish my smoke.

01:14:41.353 --> 01:14:44.731
- Finish it on the way.
- I can't drive and smoke.

01:14:45.816 --> 01:14:47.401
I can't enjoy it.

01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:52.281
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:14:54.283 --> 01:14:56.743
Get ready to head down.
- Give it some gas.

01:14:56.910 --> 01:14:59.913
Really floor it.
Build up some speed.

01:15:17.222 --> 01:15:19.766
- Can you see?
- Yes.

01:15:19.933 --> 01:15:23.520
Start slowing down a little.

01:15:23.687 --> 01:15:27.107
It won't be easy.

01:15:42.873 --> 01:15:45.626
We won't make it,
I'm telling you.

01:15:48.545 --> 01:15:50.380
The sign's right there.
We're close.

01:15:54.593 --> 01:15:56.303
Start accelerating, Jo.

01:15:56.470 --> 01:15:58.430
- Shouldn't we —
- No.

01:15:58.597 --> 01:16:00.224
Twelve minutes at high speed!

01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:02.059
- It can't blow up.
- Knock on wood.

01:16:02.226 --> 01:16:03.977
My hands are full of it.

01:16:18.617 --> 01:16:20.786
Move it. Fourth gear.

01:16:24.122 --> 01:16:25.582
Floor it. Speed up!

01:16:31.463 --> 01:16:33.966
Push it, man!
Just 100 yards to go!

01:16:41.556 --> 01:16:43.141
Come on, man!

01:16:44.017 --> 01:16:46.353
Step on the gas,
for God's sake!

01:16:53.151 --> 01:16:55.529
Are you crazy?
You blew it!

01:16:55.696 --> 01:16:57.614
Why didn't you go?
What happened?

01:16:57.781 --> 01:17:00.701
It's not my fault.
It's this lousy truck!

01:17:00.867 --> 01:17:04.496
That can't be.
A brand-new truck should go fast.

01:17:04.663 --> 01:17:06.498
It might have a throttle governor.

01:17:06.748 --> 01:17:09.835
The Americans are worried
we'll mess up their stuff.

01:17:10.585 --> 01:17:14.464
If that's true,
they're gonna hear from me!

01:17:14.631 --> 01:17:16.508
I'm sure that's it.

01:17:18.844 --> 01:17:20.637
Nothing else it could be.

01:17:35.944 --> 01:17:37.487
We're gonna try again.

01:17:37.654 --> 01:17:40.115
- Nothing in the engine?
- Nothing.

01:17:40.824 --> 01:17:42.909
Back up so I can see.

01:17:43.994 --> 01:17:45.454
Move it!

01:17:59.092 --> 01:18:00.844
Come here and look.

01:18:03.972 --> 01:18:05.307
Look.

01:18:06.641 --> 01:18:08.685
If we turn around,
we'll dig in deeper.

01:18:08.852 --> 01:18:11.813
- So?
- We have to back up in our tracks.

01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:15.150
Are you nuts?
You'll end up in the ruts.

01:18:15.317 --> 01:18:18.403
If you spin out,
we're in a real mess.

01:18:18.987 --> 01:18:22.032
We won't spin out.
Now come guide me.

01:18:22.741 --> 01:18:25.410
If I had the bastard
who filled up the tank!

01:18:26.536 --> 01:18:29.539
I bet he started
to put in diesel,

01:18:29.706 --> 01:18:33.877
and when he realized it,
the jerk didn't say a word.

01:18:34.461 --> 01:18:38.882
Don't worry.
I'll find the guy.

01:18:39.049 --> 01:18:41.927
Stop your moaning.
Now you'll get clean gas.

01:18:42.677 --> 01:18:46.306
I'm thinking. We don't
have room to speed up.

01:18:47.057 --> 01:18:49.226
Too bad.
We'll take the last part slow.

01:18:49.393 --> 01:18:52.104
What about the others?
If they're moving too fast,

01:18:52.270 --> 01:18:54.356
they won't be able to stop.

01:18:54.523 --> 01:18:56.274
They'll smash into us.

01:18:57.567 --> 01:18:59.736
Trust me.
They're crawling along.

01:19:00.779 --> 01:19:04.574
Otherwise they'd be here already.

01:19:06.076 --> 01:19:08.453
I still want to leave them a sign.

01:19:08.620 --> 01:19:10.664
Go ahead while I finish up here.

01:19:10.831 --> 01:19:12.416
You got a handkerchief?

01:19:14.751 --> 01:19:16.795
What a shame.
It's brand-new.

01:19:16.962 --> 01:19:17.962
Wait.

01:19:20.298 --> 01:19:22.092
At least I used it once.

01:19:45.615 --> 01:19:48.118
- Make up your mind!
- You're out of the tracks.

01:19:49.744 --> 01:19:52.539
That's far enough. Get in.

01:19:52.706 --> 01:19:55.625
- Maybe 100 more yards.
- Let's go.

01:20:56.061 --> 01:20:59.648
Another mile or two
and we'll be okay.

01:20:59.814 --> 01:21:02.359
We're doing just fine, my boy.

01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:45.860
You brought it.

01:22:38.663 --> 01:22:41.374
- Are you nuts? What's wrong?
- Don't you see 'em?

01:22:41.541 --> 01:22:43.501
- Who?
- Them. The Dodge.

01:22:44.336 --> 01:22:46.254
I can't see.
It's too far.

01:22:46.421 --> 01:22:47.421
Look!

01:22:48.548 --> 01:22:50.508
You're right. It's them.

01:23:00.685 --> 01:23:02.812
They're getting close.
Speed up!

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:11.738
How far away are they?

01:23:11.905 --> 01:23:16.660
- About half a mile.
- Half a mile? We're really moving.

01:23:16.826 --> 01:23:18.453
It's all over.

01:23:22.207 --> 01:23:24.918
No, it's not over.
Look.

01:23:25.085 --> 01:23:28.588
The silver marker
is the end of the washboard.

01:23:28.755 --> 01:23:30.256
Ten seconds.

01:23:31.508 --> 01:23:33.927
1... 2...

01:23:34.177 --> 01:23:35.345
Shut up!

01:23:35.553 --> 01:23:37.847
3... 4...

01:23:38.014 --> 01:23:39.349
5...

01:23:39.683 --> 01:23:40.850
6...

01:23:41.101 --> 01:23:42.435
7...

01:23:45.855 --> 01:23:46.856
10...

01:23:47.941 --> 01:23:48.692
Leave it!

01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:52.529
12, 13, 14!

01:23:59.035 --> 01:24:01.079
Look, idiot!

01:24:01.246 --> 01:24:02.872
They're speeding up!

01:24:05.458 --> 01:24:07.043
That's it, Jo.

01:24:07.210 --> 01:24:08.837
We made it.

01:24:49.335 --> 01:24:50.962
Looks bad.

01:24:51.129 --> 01:24:53.006
Doesn't look pretty.

01:24:56.593 --> 01:24:58.928
They're widening the road.

01:24:59.596 --> 01:25:01.431
We can't get by.

01:25:01.598 --> 01:25:03.475
We gotta maneuver around it.

01:25:03.641 --> 01:25:07.437
We'll have to come around here
as far as possible...

01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:12.484
then back up here...

01:25:13.777 --> 01:25:15.236
and then take off.

01:25:18.615 --> 01:25:20.742
Okay. Come on.

01:25:37.967 --> 01:25:40.136
Slowly.

01:26:27.976 --> 01:26:29.727
Back up.

01:26:29.894 --> 01:26:31.354
You got lots of room.

01:27:09.225 --> 01:27:11.853
It's nothing.
Just some rotten wood.

01:27:22.572 --> 01:27:24.032
Will it hold?

01:27:24.908 --> 01:27:26.367
Give it a try!

01:28:38.314 --> 01:28:39.983
Thanks, Luigi.

01:28:40.566 --> 01:28:44.237
It was nothing. Just takes
a good eye and a little muscle.

01:28:46.823 --> 01:28:48.408
Come see.

01:28:51.494 --> 01:28:54.747
Man, that's what you call a —

01:28:57.375 --> 01:28:59.502
A real rat trap!

01:29:01.129 --> 01:29:02.797
We gotta warn the others.

01:29:04.424 --> 01:29:05.842
How are they gonna get through?

01:29:06.467 --> 01:29:08.219
They'll manage.

01:29:08.386 --> 01:29:10.304
Anyway, they should've
stayed in the lead.

01:29:13.474 --> 01:29:14.892
Hear that?

01:29:16.019 --> 01:29:17.311
It's them!

01:29:43.504 --> 01:29:45.506
Are those for guys
who got flattened up here?

01:29:45.715 --> 01:29:49.010
They used to cart
three-ton iron hunks.

01:29:49.177 --> 01:29:52.680
On these roads, it was suicide.

01:29:53.264 --> 01:29:56.642
- You think this is any better?
- Sure it is.

01:30:42.271 --> 01:30:45.149
- What does that mean?
- Who cares!

01:30:45.316 --> 01:30:48.611
This is the end of the line for me.
- For you?

01:30:48.778 --> 01:30:52.031
For you too. How do you expect
to get by here?

01:30:52.198 --> 01:30:54.283
You can't fly over it!

01:30:54.450 --> 01:30:57.036
Let's go back — right now.

01:31:14.345 --> 01:31:15.972
Looks better over here.

01:31:16.973 --> 01:31:19.475
We'll have to go
right to the edge.

01:31:19.642 --> 01:31:22.186
The wood's completely rotten!

01:31:28.526 --> 01:31:30.528
It's like a sponge!

01:31:35.366 --> 01:31:38.161
- Are you out of your mind?
- The others made it!

01:31:38.327 --> 01:31:40.830
Our truck's twice as heavy.

01:31:40.997 --> 01:31:42.748
The nitro's got to your brain!

01:31:42.915 --> 01:31:47.295
Look at it.
Slippery as a skating rink.

01:31:47.461 --> 01:31:50.131
You'll either go
through it or off it!

01:31:53.676 --> 01:31:56.971
Listen to me, Jo.

01:31:57.138 --> 01:32:00.183
There's $2,000 waiting.
- I'd rather save my hide.

01:32:00.349 --> 01:32:02.393
You should have thought
of that before.

01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:05.563
I didn't beg to come.
I told you I was scared.

01:32:05.730 --> 01:32:09.025
"Don't worry, kid. I'll show you
how it's done." Remember?

01:32:09.192 --> 01:32:11.485
We're going through.

01:32:11.652 --> 01:32:15.907
- It's crazy!
- It was crazy taking on this job.

01:32:16.073 --> 01:32:18.784
You got me into this —
don't forget that.

01:32:19.911 --> 01:32:22.163
Now get back there
and guide me.

01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:27.919
Poor sap!

01:32:29.212 --> 01:32:30.796
You'll get a medal...

01:32:31.672 --> 01:32:32.882
posthumously.

01:32:36.969 --> 01:32:38.221
Ready.

01:32:39.055 --> 01:32:40.514
Easy!

01:32:41.390 --> 01:32:43.017
Easy!

01:33:04.914 --> 01:33:06.332
Okay, hold it!

01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:08.793
Hold it!

01:33:09.710 --> 01:33:11.671
I said to the edge!

01:33:32.608 --> 01:33:34.277
How much further?

01:33:52.211 --> 01:33:53.921
My God!

01:34:26.871 --> 01:34:28.331
Jo, answer me!

01:34:33.377 --> 01:34:35.546
Stop kidding around!

01:34:42.803 --> 01:34:44.388
What a spot!

01:35:14.085 --> 01:35:15.544
You louse!

01:35:19.590 --> 01:35:21.759
Don't try to hide!

01:35:21.926 --> 01:35:23.636
I see you!

01:35:25.763 --> 01:35:29.350
I see you!
Get back down here, you bastard!

01:38:56.515 --> 01:38:58.434
Wait for me, Mario!

01:39:04.732 --> 01:39:06.483
Mario says, "Screw you!"

01:40:08.170 --> 01:40:10.964
Well? You coming or not?

01:40:25.354 --> 01:40:28.774
You low-down rat!

01:40:28.941 --> 01:40:31.318
- Listen —
- I know.

01:40:31.527 --> 01:40:32.736
You got the jitters.

01:40:32.986 --> 01:40:34.363
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

01:40:34.530 --> 01:40:36.323
Mr. Big Shot's got the shakes.

01:40:36.949 --> 01:40:38.867
Some tough guy!

01:40:39.034 --> 01:40:41.203
A real Al Capone!

01:40:41.954 --> 01:40:45.124
Malaria, my ass!

01:40:46.375 --> 01:40:49.128
You're scared stiff.
You're a woman.

01:40:49.294 --> 01:40:51.672
Lay off! If you knew
what I've been through —

01:40:51.839 --> 01:40:53.424
Don't give me that!

01:40:54.299 --> 01:40:57.344
Maybe you were a man once —
in my grandma's time.

01:40:58.387 --> 01:41:01.724
Now you play it safe
and shoot a guy in the back

01:41:01.890 --> 01:41:05.227
'cause you don't like risk.
- 'Cause I know what risk is.

01:41:05.394 --> 01:41:09.565
You just plunge ahead.
You think you're invincible.

01:41:10.149 --> 01:41:12.651
You can't see
10 feet ahead of you.

01:41:12.901 --> 01:41:16.071
I see every pebble, every hole
that could send us sky-high.

01:41:16.572 --> 01:41:20.159
I've died 50 times
since last night.

01:41:20.909 --> 01:41:25.706
I can see the explosion up here.
I see myself blown to bits.

01:41:27.583 --> 01:41:30.085
'Cause I've got brains
in my head!

01:41:31.879 --> 01:41:34.006
If only you had balls too.

01:41:34.423 --> 01:41:37.509
Keep talking.
Yours'll be hanging from a tree,

01:41:37.676 --> 01:41:39.261
like a couple of cherries.

01:41:46.435 --> 01:41:50.439
Hey, want a drag?

01:41:51.440 --> 01:41:54.109
I'll buy you one
day after tomorrow.

01:41:54.818 --> 01:41:56.361
We'll each have one.

01:41:56.528 --> 01:41:58.280
That's right.

01:41:58.447 --> 01:42:01.158
Bimba, why are you so sad?

01:42:01.742 --> 01:42:04.369
No more mixing cement.

01:42:04.536 --> 01:42:06.121
We're gonna be rich...

01:42:07.414 --> 01:42:08.791
if we don't die first.

01:42:08.957 --> 01:42:11.084
And if we do,
it'll be over anyway.

01:42:12.002 --> 01:42:16.256
But if we don't,
it'll be nice to get away.

01:42:16.423 --> 01:42:18.967
- Where to?
- Anywhere.

01:42:19.134 --> 01:42:21.178
To swap mosquitoes?
No, thanks.

01:42:21.929 --> 01:42:23.889
The ones here are just fine.

01:42:24.932 --> 01:42:27.100
Those back home are better.

01:42:27.643 --> 01:42:30.979
I'm going back to Calabria
with the dough.

01:42:31.146 --> 01:42:32.898
I'll buy a house

01:42:33.816 --> 01:42:37.444
and marry a pretty girl.

01:42:42.491 --> 01:42:45.244
If you're scared,
you can get out.

01:42:45.410 --> 01:42:47.579
This truck's not a rest home.

01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:52.251
I'm staying.
I need to earn the dough.

01:42:52.417 --> 01:42:54.753
Earn the dough?
I'm doing all the work.

01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:57.089
I'm not some charity.

01:42:57.673 --> 01:43:00.008
I do the work, and you collect.

01:43:00.175 --> 01:43:02.678
$2,000 and so long!

01:43:03.262 --> 01:43:07.015
You can forget that.
You've got to pump the pedal for it.

01:43:07.182 --> 01:43:09.142
That's what they pay you for.

01:43:09.309 --> 01:43:11.603
Think they pay you to drive?

01:43:11.770 --> 01:43:13.772
They pay you to be terrified.

01:43:13.939 --> 01:43:16.817
There's your division of labor.

01:43:16.984 --> 01:43:20.863
You drive and I worry myself shitless.
You got the better deal.

01:43:53.312 --> 01:43:55.063
That's all we needed.

01:44:06.116 --> 01:44:07.743
This is too much.

01:44:11.622 --> 01:44:13.373
We're jinxed!

01:44:14.416 --> 01:44:19.087
Lousy rock!
How'd you ever get here?

01:44:19.254 --> 01:44:21.673
It came from up there.

01:44:26.428 --> 01:44:28.805
Goddamn rocks!

01:44:35.270 --> 01:44:36.813
Rotten luck.

01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:38.774
It's all over now!

01:44:39.608 --> 01:44:40.608
Wait.

01:44:42.653 --> 01:44:44.905
We'll move it with a crowbar.

01:44:45.072 --> 01:44:48.033
You crazy?
It weighs at least 50 tons.

01:44:50.661 --> 01:44:52.579
So what do we do?

01:44:59.127 --> 01:45:00.879
We'll blow it up.

01:45:02.047 --> 01:45:04.549
With what?

01:45:04.716 --> 01:45:07.177
Think what we've got won't do it?

01:45:07.344 --> 01:45:09.888
A whole jerrican?

01:45:10.055 --> 01:45:13.141
A jerrican?
Why not a ton?

01:45:13.725 --> 01:45:16.979
No, a quart will do it.

01:45:17.145 --> 01:45:18.605
Thank God.

01:45:19.690 --> 01:45:22.693
But how'll you get it out?

01:45:22.859 --> 01:45:24.778
I'll siphon it out.

01:45:25.487 --> 01:45:29.658
Meanwhile, take this bar
and make me a hole —

01:45:33.829 --> 01:45:35.831
A hole right in the stone.

01:45:36.665 --> 01:45:38.625
About 30 inches deep.

01:46:55.660 --> 01:46:57.079
That enough?

01:46:58.705 --> 01:47:02.417
Yeah. Now get me
the jack handle and the hammer.

01:48:02.310 --> 01:48:04.062
What's going on, guys?

01:48:04.229 --> 01:48:07.149
- You got eyes.
- He's blowing it up.

01:48:07.315 --> 01:48:09.192
What? You're nuts!

01:48:09.359 --> 01:48:11.403
Gotta clear the road, don't we?

01:48:12.779 --> 01:48:14.197
What do you say?

01:48:16.700 --> 01:48:17.784
Nothing.

01:48:17.951 --> 01:48:21.621
Everyone gets his say here.
Even you.

01:48:23.498 --> 01:48:25.083
I don't give a damn.

01:48:25.917 --> 01:48:28.336
Isn't that a bit risky?

01:48:28.503 --> 01:48:30.672
The whole load could blow,
and us with it.

01:48:30.839 --> 01:48:31.965
Of course.

01:48:33.008 --> 01:48:36.511
We'll get the trucks out of the way.
Yours first.

01:48:36.678 --> 01:48:37.929
Then ours.

01:48:39.598 --> 01:48:41.183
Hear that?

01:48:41.349 --> 01:48:43.393
Hey, big shot, you hear that?

01:48:45.604 --> 01:48:47.814
Okay. Let's back it up.

01:48:52.485 --> 01:48:54.196
What's with him?

01:48:54.362 --> 01:48:55.780
He's got the jitters.

01:48:56.406 --> 01:48:59.534
If you need a tough guy,
he's all yours.

01:49:00.118 --> 01:49:01.703
Just look at him.

01:49:02.370 --> 01:49:04.664
Get going, you!

01:49:08.043 --> 01:49:12.214
Can't you see
he's just a walking corpse?

01:49:12.380 --> 01:49:14.716
You think we're not?

01:49:14.883 --> 01:49:19.221
Mario, get the jerrican
as far away as you can.

01:49:21.890 --> 01:49:23.934
Luigi, hand me the thermos.

01:49:39.491 --> 01:49:41.743
Is there enough in here?

01:49:41.910 --> 01:49:44.788
- Maybe too much.
- Pretty slick.

01:49:44.955 --> 01:49:47.958
It's simple.
I light the cord,

01:49:48.750 --> 01:49:51.253
and when it reaches here,

01:49:51.419 --> 01:49:53.588
the hammer falls and — bingo!

01:49:56.466 --> 01:49:58.927
Go find me a palm branch.

01:50:28.456 --> 01:50:29.582
Here.

01:50:32.544 --> 01:50:34.921
Okay. Now clear out.

01:50:35.088 --> 01:50:36.548
So this is it?

01:50:38.133 --> 01:50:40.218
First go back up the truck,

01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:42.929
and then —

01:50:44.389 --> 01:50:46.975
We can't take
unnecessary risks.

01:50:47.684 --> 01:50:49.311
So long.

01:50:55.817 --> 01:50:57.235
Your cigar.

01:51:23.887 --> 01:51:25.180
Stop!

01:51:29.100 --> 01:51:30.810
We're good here.

01:51:30.977 --> 01:51:34.147
Sure, we're great.

01:52:15.146 --> 01:52:16.731
Keep coming.

01:52:31.496 --> 01:52:33.248
How's it going down there?

01:52:33.998 --> 01:52:35.083
Fine.

01:53:16.791 --> 01:53:18.418
It's taking a while.

01:55:47.442 --> 01:55:48.860
Take cover!

01:55:53.281 --> 01:55:56.909
The trucks!
What if rocks fall on 'em?

01:55:57.076 --> 01:55:58.870
- Back 'em up more!
- Too late!

01:55:59.829 --> 01:56:01.289
I'll put it out!

01:56:01.456 --> 01:56:04.042
- Come with us!
- It's safer!

01:56:16.763 --> 01:56:18.348
Get down, idiot!

01:58:11.753 --> 01:58:13.337
Is he dead?

01:58:14.172 --> 01:58:15.590
He's breathing!

01:58:15.757 --> 01:58:18.217
Breathing the smell
of your stinkin' feet!

01:58:19.260 --> 01:58:20.344
Bastard!

01:58:20.678 --> 01:58:22.305
You had us worried!

01:58:23.848 --> 01:58:27.268
Are you hurt?
- Wait. Let me see.

01:58:28.811 --> 01:58:31.773
You really scared us.
We thought you'd had it.

01:58:33.524 --> 01:58:34.942
So did I.

01:58:45.953 --> 01:58:48.080
Blessed are the poor in spirit.

01:58:48.289 --> 01:58:50.541
The blast just knocked him over.

01:58:51.292 --> 01:58:53.085
And the rock too. Look.

01:58:53.628 --> 01:58:55.505
Not a bad job at all.

01:58:56.839 --> 01:58:58.299
Congratulations.

01:58:58.508 --> 01:59:00.468
We do what we can.

01:59:01.177 --> 01:59:03.179
- Nothing left.
- All gone.

01:59:03.763 --> 01:59:05.348
See that?

01:59:06.933 --> 01:59:08.726
This sure is twisted.

01:59:09.310 --> 01:59:10.895
You're the twisted ones.

01:59:11.062 --> 01:59:13.773
It worked, didn't it?
So shut up.

01:59:14.315 --> 01:59:15.942
Let's pour a toast.

01:59:16.818 --> 01:59:19.153
If you're going,
I've gotta go too.

01:59:19.320 --> 01:59:20.905
Yeah, let's pour one.

01:59:23.199 --> 01:59:24.992
So I'm not invited, eh?

01:59:28.663 --> 01:59:30.498
I'll make my own toast.

01:59:45.847 --> 01:59:48.599
Careful. No shaking.

01:59:48.850 --> 01:59:50.726
You sure are something.

01:59:51.477 --> 01:59:53.729
Mario's got guts.
So have I.

01:59:53.896 --> 01:59:55.690
Jo has none at all.

01:59:55.857 --> 01:59:59.026
But you take the cake.

02:00:00.361 --> 02:00:02.363
Ever worked in a salt mine?

02:00:03.072 --> 02:00:05.575
The Nazis gave me three years of it.

02:00:05.741 --> 02:00:08.411
I was half dead when I got out.

02:00:08.953 --> 02:00:11.706
Compared to that,
a little nitroglycerine —

02:00:11.873 --> 02:00:13.791
Sure, but even so.

02:00:14.292 --> 02:00:15.751
Why shave?

02:00:17.420 --> 02:00:18.880
Listen, Luigi.

02:00:19.964 --> 02:00:21.716
Before he was hanged,

02:00:22.717 --> 02:00:26.178
my father asked to take a shower.

02:00:27.513 --> 02:00:29.640
It runs in the family.

02:00:30.224 --> 02:00:32.435
I've never come to the table
without washing my hands.

02:00:35.730 --> 02:00:39.525
If I've gotta be a corpse,
I want to be...

02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:42.612
presentable.

02:00:50.161 --> 02:00:51.746
You should eat.

02:00:52.496 --> 02:00:55.082
I couldn't eat
anything right now.

02:00:57.919 --> 02:01:01.672
But I'd like a cold drink...

02:01:02.423 --> 02:01:04.133
in a Paris bistro.

02:01:04.300 --> 02:01:07.094
Want a smoke?
- Roll me one.

02:01:12.516 --> 02:01:16.270
<i>Good old French tobacco</i>

02:01:17.104 --> 02:01:19.023
Ever hear that one?

02:01:19.190 --> 02:01:21.108
No, but you're off-key.

02:01:21.275 --> 02:01:23.194
That's 'cause
my conscience is clear.

02:01:23.361 --> 02:01:24.779
No kidding.

02:01:47.301 --> 02:01:48.928
No more Luigi.

02:01:50.304 --> 02:01:54.016
Play with fire
and you end up getting burned!

02:01:54.767 --> 02:01:56.644
It could have been us.

02:01:57.645 --> 02:01:59.188
Poor guy.

02:01:59.355 --> 02:02:01.399
Forget it.
They took a chance and lost.

02:02:01.565 --> 02:02:03.317
That's life.

02:02:03.484 --> 02:02:06.654
Your buddy goes up in smoke
and that's all you can say?

02:02:06.821 --> 02:02:08.447
What's it matter anyway?

02:02:09.991 --> 02:02:13.536
I'll smack you!
- Are you crazy?

02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:16.038
Stop!

02:02:18.499 --> 02:02:21.335
- Shut the door.
- I've had it!

02:03:01.500 --> 02:03:02.710
Drop it!

02:03:02.877 --> 02:03:04.670
Drop the rock!

02:03:05.212 --> 02:03:06.212
You first!

02:03:14.513 --> 02:03:16.140
Bastard!

02:03:22.938 --> 02:03:26.317
It might not be right,
but I'm the strongest,

02:03:26.484 --> 02:03:28.235
so it buys me some time.

02:03:29.487 --> 02:03:30.529
Get up!

02:03:43.667 --> 02:03:46.128
Why are you so lousy to me?

02:03:47.421 --> 02:03:49.006
You still don't get it?

02:03:49.757 --> 02:03:52.718
I need your help.
It's just you and me now.

02:03:52.885 --> 02:03:55.012
So you're gonna stick with me

02:03:55.930 --> 02:03:57.723
to the very end.

02:03:59.058 --> 02:04:00.935
Get back to the truck.

02:04:07.149 --> 02:04:09.652
You're lucky I'm an old man!

02:04:09.819 --> 02:04:11.862
I'm washed up, a coward!

02:04:16.075 --> 02:04:17.075
Faster.

02:04:38.806 --> 02:04:42.268
What an explosion.
Take a look at this.

02:05:56.217 --> 02:05:58.093
It's like they just fell in.

02:05:58.260 --> 02:06:00.930
The tracks go right
to the edge and stop.

02:06:02.223 --> 02:06:03.766
Funny.

02:06:03.933 --> 02:06:06.977
Like tracks of a plane
that took off.

02:06:07.228 --> 02:06:09.063
That's just what happened.

02:06:10.231 --> 02:06:12.024
They took off.

02:06:16.362 --> 02:06:18.239
I wonder what happened.

02:06:18.405 --> 02:06:20.032
How would I know?

02:06:21.533 --> 02:06:23.118
We'll never know.

02:06:23.744 --> 02:06:25.663
I'm sure even they didn't know.

02:06:45.933 --> 02:06:47.351
It's not deep.

02:06:47.977 --> 02:06:49.603
But it'll rise.

02:06:51.146 --> 02:06:53.148
Look at that.
Even the pipe's broken.

02:06:53.315 --> 02:06:55.859
In half an hour
it'll be one big lake of oil.

02:06:57.569 --> 02:07:00.739
We get all the lousy breaks!

02:07:09.123 --> 02:07:10.291
Look.

02:07:10.457 --> 02:07:12.042
Bimba's cigarette holder.

02:07:13.460 --> 02:07:15.087
That's all that's left.

02:07:15.629 --> 02:07:19.258
Okay. Let's go.
Otherwise we'll need a boat.

02:07:21.010 --> 02:07:24.138
Test the bottom
while I get the truck.

02:07:47.328 --> 02:07:50.080
I'll be back in two minutes.

02:07:51.123 --> 02:07:52.666
Yeah, yeah.

02:07:53.959 --> 02:07:56.670
Two minutes, next year —
what's it matter now?

02:08:14.396 --> 02:08:15.981
Well?

02:08:18.650 --> 02:08:20.069
It's slick.

02:08:21.070 --> 02:08:23.072
I said it's slick.

02:08:23.238 --> 02:08:26.992
You'll spin out. If you stop,
you'll never get started again.

02:08:28.744 --> 02:08:30.371
We got no choice.

02:08:32.206 --> 02:08:33.206
Okay.

02:08:34.958 --> 02:08:36.835
Just don't stop!

02:08:37.002 --> 02:08:38.420
I'm right behind you.

02:09:09.743 --> 02:09:12.204
- It's deep.
- Keep going.

02:09:21.255 --> 02:09:23.132
Hurry up!

02:09:26.802 --> 02:09:28.720
Wait, wait!

02:09:42.443 --> 02:09:43.443
Stop!

02:09:43.527 --> 02:09:45.863
Get out of the way!

02:09:46.780 --> 02:09:48.240
I can't!

02:09:48.449 --> 02:09:49.992
I'm stuck!

02:09:51.452 --> 02:09:52.453
Move!

02:09:54.872 --> 02:09:56.790
Mario, stop!

02:11:40.894 --> 02:11:43.105
My leg!

02:11:43.272 --> 02:11:46.650
Why didn't you get out of the way?
Don't we have enough problems?

02:11:47.651 --> 02:11:50.445
You bastard. You knew
you were running over me.

02:11:50.612 --> 02:11:53.240
But you ran
right over your buddy.

02:11:53.407 --> 02:11:55.909
Buddy or not, I had to.

02:11:59.788 --> 02:12:01.415
You're hurting me!

02:12:10.257 --> 02:12:12.759
It's your fault. I told you
to get out of the way.

02:12:12.926 --> 02:12:14.303
If I hadn't hesitated —

02:12:14.469 --> 02:12:16.221
- You did?
- Yes, I did!

02:12:16.388 --> 02:12:18.307
If not, I'd have made it.

02:12:18.557 --> 02:12:21.018
Now we're stuck
on account of you.

02:12:21.184 --> 02:12:23.020
Out of the running.

02:12:23.604 --> 02:12:28.150
And not even blown up —
just stuck in the mud.

02:12:28.317 --> 02:12:29.776
Some heroes!

02:12:30.193 --> 02:12:33.614
Do something.
You can't imagine the pain!

02:12:33.780 --> 02:12:35.532
Like I've got the time.

02:12:37.868 --> 02:12:39.286
I'm in agony!

02:12:40.537 --> 02:12:43.206
Here's your chance
to take it easy.

02:12:43.373 --> 02:12:45.751
It's just what you wanted!

02:13:29.169 --> 02:13:31.088
Hurry up. This is bad.

02:16:15.335 --> 02:16:16.878
The ride too rough for you?

02:16:17.045 --> 02:16:19.172
I'm not made of nitroglycerine.

02:16:19.840 --> 02:16:21.466
I'm not dangerous.

02:16:23.176 --> 02:16:24.594
Not anymore.

02:16:31.184 --> 02:16:32.936
Stinks in here, doesn't it?

02:16:33.102 --> 02:16:34.271
Yeah.

02:16:36.189 --> 02:16:39.150
- It's my leg.
- Come off it.

02:16:39.316 --> 02:16:40.943
It's just the oil.

02:16:42.654 --> 02:16:45.031
It's me.
I smell like rotting flesh.

02:16:45.198 --> 02:16:46.825
Stop talking nonsense.

02:16:47.742 --> 02:16:50.704
It's terrible to rot alive.

02:16:50.870 --> 02:16:53.498
Get all worked up
and you're done for.

02:16:53.707 --> 02:16:55.791
Look at my nails.

02:16:55.959 --> 02:16:57.544
They're purple.

02:16:59.462 --> 02:17:01.423
This is the end.

02:17:01.590 --> 02:17:05.385
Stop it, all right? You're not gonna
let yourself die, are you?

02:17:06.428 --> 02:17:08.305
It's out of my hands.

02:17:22.277 --> 02:17:24.070
Talk to me, Jo.
Say something.

02:17:24.737 --> 02:17:26.406
I feel like sleeping.

02:17:26.573 --> 02:17:28.950
No, you gotta keep on fighting!

02:17:29.117 --> 02:17:30.994
I'm tired.

02:17:32.995 --> 02:17:35.498
You gotta force yourself.

02:17:36.958 --> 02:17:40.085
Come on, Jo.
- What do you wanna talk about?

02:17:40.378 --> 02:17:42.464
Anything you like.

02:17:44.007 --> 02:17:45.592
Where did you live in Paris?

02:17:48.011 --> 02:17:49.596
On the rue Galande.

02:17:50.430 --> 02:17:53.099
No kidding.
I know that street.

02:17:53.266 --> 02:17:55.101
That was a long time ago.

02:17:55.769 --> 02:17:57.353
That's funny.

02:17:58.146 --> 02:18:00.732
You remember
the tobacco shop on the corner?

02:18:00.898 --> 02:18:03.610
- Is it still there?
- Sure is.

02:18:04.903 --> 02:18:06.655
Next to the hardware store.

02:18:07.739 --> 02:18:11.825
In my time,
there was a fence there.

02:18:11.993 --> 02:18:15.538
No, you're right.
There's a fence.

02:18:15.705 --> 02:18:19.501
I never knew
what was beyond it.

02:18:20.334 --> 02:18:22.462
Nothing. Just an empty lot.

02:18:25.924 --> 02:18:29.218
- Feeling worse?
- I'm okay.

02:18:31.513 --> 02:18:33.974
What a long street.

02:18:34.808 --> 02:18:36.558
I'm all out of breath.

02:19:14.013 --> 02:19:15.807
Jo, old buddy.

02:19:16.683 --> 02:19:18.183
Hold on.

02:19:18.351 --> 02:19:20.102
We're almost there.

02:19:25.650 --> 02:19:27.235
You asleep?

02:19:29.320 --> 02:19:30.905
I'm trying to remember.

02:19:32.949 --> 02:19:34.117
What?

02:19:35.869 --> 02:19:37.495
The fence.

02:19:39.371 --> 02:19:42.083
What was beyond the fence?

02:19:42.250 --> 02:19:44.002
I told you: nothing.

02:19:45.879 --> 02:19:46.879
Nothing.

02:19:53.845 --> 02:19:55.430
There's nothing!

02:20:17.410 --> 02:20:19.162
Look, we made it!

02:20:31.424 --> 02:20:32.842
Old pal.

02:20:37.263 --> 02:20:38.890
That's right.

02:20:39.974 --> 02:20:41.601
Take a little nap.

02:20:44.979 --> 02:20:46.940
Not like that.
It scares me.

02:22:54.067 --> 02:22:55.777
Amazing!

02:22:57.028 --> 02:22:58.905
Tell me, what was it like?

02:25:34.227 --> 02:25:37.105
Hello? What?

02:25:39.649 --> 02:25:41.067
It can't be.

02:25:41.234 --> 02:25:45.446
Bad news. Luigi and Bimba
were blown up. Jo's dead.

02:25:45.613 --> 02:25:48.783
- What about Mario?
- He'll be here in two hours.

02:25:48.950 --> 02:25:51.577
Are you sure?

02:25:53.121 --> 02:25:54.497
Praise God!

02:25:54.747 --> 02:25:58.418
Doc, did you hear that?
He'll be here in two hours!
