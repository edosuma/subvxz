WEBVTT

00:11.476 --> 00:12.710
>>> THIS IS ALL WRONG.
PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING.

00:12.810 --> 00:18.619
PEOPLE ARE DYING.
ENTIRE ECOSYSTEMS ARE

00:18.719 --> 00:23.793
COLLAPSING.
FOR MORE THAN 30 YEARS, THE

00:23.893 --> 00:28.133
SCIENCE HAS BEEN CRYSTAL CLEAR.

00:28.233 --> 00:28.800
>> WATER.

00:28.900 --> 00:29.734
>> IS LIFE.

00:30.002 --> 00:37.813
>> THE POLITICS AND SOLUTIONS
ARE NOWHERE NEEDED.

00:37.913 --> 00:45.490
WE ARE IN THE BEGINNING --
ECONOMIC GROWTH.

00:45.590 --> 00:50.431
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW, IS WHERE
WE DRAW THE LINE.

00:50.531 --> 00:53.768
>> IN MY VIEW, WE HAVE WAITED
TOO LONG TO DEAL WITH THIS

00:53.869 --> 00:55.771
CLIMATE CRISIS.
IT'S TIME TO ACT.

00:55.871 --> 01:01.280
MY MESSAGE TO THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE
IS, YOUR GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO

01:01.380 --> 01:02.314
WORK WITH YOU.

01:02.414 --> 01:03.883
>> THE BIDEN WHITE HOUSE HIT THE
GROUND RUNNING.

01:03.983 --> 01:07.488
>> SIGNED EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT
HIS ADMINISTRATION SAYS WILL

01:07.588 --> 01:09.324
ADDRESS THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT.

01:09.424 --> 01:13.530
>> PRESIDENT BIDEN'S NEW
EXECUTIVE OR IS FACING PUSH

01:13.630 --> 01:14.064
BACK.

01:14.832 --> 01:18.137
>> PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS TOLD
UNION WORKERS, YOUR JOBS ARE

01:18.237 --> 01:18.671
GONE.

01:19.538 --> 01:22.877
>> TEXAS REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING
TO BLAME GREEN ENERGY FOR THE

01:22.977 --> 01:24.545
MASSIVE POWER OUTAGES.

01:24.645 --> 01:27.817
>> THIS SHOWS HOW THE GREEN NEW
DEAL WOULD BE DEADLY FOR THE

01:27.917 --> 01:28.752
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

01:28.852 --> 01:34.961
>> BIDEN'S GREEN AGENDA FACES
HEADWINTD S

01:35.061 --> 01:35.595
HEADWIN
HEADWINDS.

01:35.695 --> 01:37.297
>> HE WILL NEED CONGRESS.

01:37.398 --> 01:44.207
>> DRAWING PUSHBACK FROM MEMBERS
OF HIS OWN PARTY.

01:44.307 --> 01:47.512
>> REQUIRING THEM TO CONVINCE
SOME REPUBLICANS TO GET ANYTHING

01:47.612 --> 01:48.045
DONE.

01:48.947 --> 01:50.149
>> THEY WILL NOT HAVE THAT MANY
CHANCES TO GET SOMETHING BIG AND

01:50.249 --> 01:55.389
SWEEPING ACROSS THE FINISH LINE.

01:55.489 --> 02:10.812
>> WE WILL BE WATCHING YOU.

02:36.247 --> 02:40.186
>> HELLO.

02:40.286 --> 02:43.424
>> I HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT.
I GOT MY FIRST SHOT.

02:43.524 --> 02:44.292
>> YEAH, MAN!

02:44.392 --> 02:45.660
>> I'M VACCINATED.

02:45.760 --> 02:48.932
>> THIS IS SO EXCITING.
JUST IN TIME FOR OUR TRAVEL

02:49.032 --> 02:49.600
SEASON TO END.

02:49.700 --> 02:50.835
>> YEAH, RIGHT.

02:50.935 --> 02:53.439
>> I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT IT, I'M
DAY DRINKING.

02:53.539 --> 02:57.043
>> SO AM I.
I HAVE A SPICY BLOODY MARY AND A

02:57.143 --> 02:57.444
BEER.

02:57.544 --> 02:57.945
>> STRONG.

02:58.045 --> 03:00.516
>> STRONG MOVE.

03:00.616 --> 03:04.654
>> HAPPY PRESIDENTS' DAY.

03:04.754 --> 03:08.994
>> THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS
FINALLY OCCUPYING CENTER STAGE.

03:09.094 --> 03:12.833
>> PIVOT AWAY FROM TRUMP AND
FOCUS ON ONE OF THE MOST

03:12.933 --> 03:17.006
DIFFICULT PRESIDENCIES IN
AMERICAN HISTORY.

03:17.106 --> 03:20.810
>> THERE'S ONE CRISIS BIGGER
THAN CRISIS.

03:20.911 --> 03:23.548
THE EXISTENTIAL CRISIS LOOMING
FOR PLANET EARTH.

03:23.648 --> 03:27.120
>> THE MAINSTREAM OF SCIENCE,
FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS, HAS BEEN

03:27.220 --> 03:30.024
SAYING, GUYS, THE WORLD IS ON
FIRE.

03:30.124 --> 03:32.561
WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING DRAMATIC
RIGHT NOW.

03:32.661 --> 03:37.601
>> THERE'S A LOT OF SCRUTINY ON
BIDEN AND WHERE HE IS

03:37.701 --> 03:39.971
IDEOLOGICALLY.
HE IS MAINTAINING THIS

03:40.071 --> 03:46.547
BIPARTISAN POSITIONING ON MOST
ISSUES BUT NOT CLIMATE.

03:46.647 --> 03:51.888
THROWING DOWN EXECUTIVE ORDERS,
REJOINING THE PARIS CLIMATE

03:51.988 --> 03:54.124
ACCORD, CANCELLING THE KEYSTONE
PIPELINE.

03:54.224 --> 03:58.564
>> KEYSTONE TRANSPORTS OIL FROM
THE TAR SANDS UP IN ALBERTA,

03:58.664 --> 04:02.837
CANADA, ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE
UNITED STATES DOWN TO THE GULF.

04:02.937 --> 04:06.642
THERE'S SOME NUMBER OF JOBS IN
EVERY STATE IT CROSSES THROUGH.

04:06.742 --> 04:09.981
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WAS
BEDEVILLED BY IT FOR A LONG

04:10.081 --> 04:11.716
TIME.
EVENTUALLY STOPS IT.

04:11.816 --> 04:15.254
TRUMP COMES IN AND SAYS,
KEYSTONE IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS.

04:15.355 --> 04:18.392
NOW ON THE DAY HE WAS INAUGURATE
NOW ON THE DAY HE WAS INAUG

04:18.492 --> 04:24.201
INAUGURATED, JOE BIDEN STEPS IN
AND SAYS, WE ARE WITHDRAWING THE

04:24.301 --> 04:25.002
PERMIT.
TA

04:25.102 --> 04:28.373
PERMIT.
IT IS A GIANT SHIT STORM.

04:28.473 --> 04:32.078
>> COME TO MIDDLE AMERICA AND
TELL THEM WHY YOU TOOK THEIR

04:32.178 --> 04:32.812
JOBS AWAY.

04:33.146 --> 04:35.917
>> KEVIN McCARTHY HAS HAD EVENTS
IN TEXAS.

04:36.018 --> 04:36.551
>> THE AFL/

04:37.219 --> 04:40.423
>> THE AFL\CIO, THE MOST
RELIABLE DEMOCRATIC INTEREST

04:40.524 --> 04:44.462
GROUP IN AMERICA IS TOTALLY
BANGING ON BIDEN IN THE SAME WAY

04:44.562 --> 04:45.831
KEVIN McCARTHY IS.

04:45.931 --> 04:50.872
>> PICKING CLIMATE OVER JOBS,
SYMBOLICALLY IT CAN HURT BIDEN.

04:50.972 --> 04:53.142
REPUBLICANS CAN USE IT.
MY TRUMP SUPPORTING RELATIVES

04:53.242 --> 04:56.279
ARE ASKING ME WHY WOULD HE DO
THIS AND COST JOBS.

04:56.379 --> 04:59.718
>> THE REALITY IS, KEYSTONE
ISN'T JUST ABOUT KEYSTONE.

04:59.818 --> 05:02.121
THERE'S PIPELINES ALL OVER THE
COUNTRY.

05:02.221 --> 05:05.559
WE HEARD ABOUT THE DAKOTA ACCESS
LINE.

05:05.659 --> 05:09.198
THERE'S FIGHTS AND VIOLENCE.
AND THEN IN NORTHERN MINNESOTA

05:09.298 --> 05:10.466
THERE'S A FIGHT.

05:10.566 --> 05:14.706
>> THREE PIPELINE, THERE'S A TON
OF MOMENTUM TO GET BIDEN TO DO

05:14.806 --> 05:18.945
THE SAME THING FOR THOSE
PIPELINES.

05:19.045 --> 05:22.316
A REPRESENTATIVE FROM MINNESOTA,
SHE'S BECOME THE FACE OF THE

05:22.416 --> 05:26.389
GREEN NEW DEAL WING OF THE PARTY
THAT IS SAYING, WE CANNOT

05:26.489 --> 05:30.695
ENTERTAIN FOSSIL FUEL DEPENDENCY
ANY LONGER.

05:30.795 --> 05:34.467
>> POLITICS ARE COMPLICATED.
YOU HAVE PEOPLE LIKE JOHN

05:34.567 --> 05:36.803
TESTER, AN ENERGY STATE
DEMOCRAT, WHO WANT TO BE WITH

05:36.903 --> 05:39.373
JOE BIDEN IN GENERAL.
BUT WHO ARE WORED

05:39.474 --> 05:47.285
BUT WHO ARE WORRY BUT WHO ARE
WORRIED IF BIDEN

05:47.385 --> 05:48.620
GOING FULL GREEN DEAL.

05:48.720 --> 05:51.924
>> BUSINESS IS MOVING AHEAD OF
POLITICS.

05:52.024 --> 05:54.562
GM, WHO PLEDGED TO GO FULLY
ELECTRIC BY 2035.

05:54.662 --> 05:57.466
WHEN YOU HAVE CAR COMPANIES
COMING OUT AND SAYING THEY WILL

05:57.566 --> 06:00.403
GO ELECTRIC AND GET AWAY FROM
CARBON, THAT'S HUGELY

06:00.504 --> 06:01.171
SIGNIFICANT.

06:01.739 --> 06:04.209
>> THE SILVER LINING FOR BIDEN
IN THIS IS THAT THE AMERICAN

06:04.309 --> 06:07.080
CONSUMER HAS CHANGED HIS OR HER
MIND ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE

06:07.180 --> 06:08.248
ON CLIMATE CHANGE.

06:08.348 --> 06:10.651
>> THERE'S NO MORE IMPORTANT
ISSUE TO YOUNG VOTERS ON THE

06:10.751 --> 06:14.791
LEFT THAN CLIMATE.
IT IS ONE, TWO AND THREE IN

06:14.891 --> 06:16.727
TERMS OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
ISSUES FOR THEM.

06:16.827 --> 06:18.997
>> I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE
THESE ARE GOING TO BE DIG,

06:19.097 --> 06:23.603
THESE ARE GOING TO BE DIBIG,
CONTENTIOUS ISSUES.

06:23.703 --> 06:28.243
THE ADMINISTRATION WILL DISCOVER
IT'S NOT EASY BEING GREEN.

06:28.343 --> 06:36.454
>> MY GOD.

06:36.555 --> 06:40.260
>> THE POWERFUL WINTER STORM
AFFECTING AT LEAST 160 MILLION

06:40.360 --> 06:41.995
PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

06:42.095 --> 06:45.134
>> TEMPERATURES ARE 30, 40, 50
DEGREES BELOW AVERAGE.

06:45.234 --> 06:48.672
>> MORE THAN 4 MILLION PEOPLE
WITHOUT POWER IN TEXAS ALONE.

06:48.772 --> 06:53.745
>> 13 MILLION TEXANS ARE WITHOUT
WATER FOR DAYS.

06:53.846 --> 06:57.184
>> CLIMATE CHANGE.
YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE IMPACT OF

06:57.284 --> 06:58.552
CLIMATE CHANGE HERE.
THE FACT THAT THIS WILL PROBABLY

06:58.652 --> 07:02.859
HAPPEN AGAIN.

07:02.959 --> 07:06.764
>> WE ARE IN NORTHERN MINNESOTA
WHERE END BRIDGE IS

07:06.865 --> 07:11.638
RECONSTRUCTING PART OF ONE OF
THE WORLD'S LONGEST OIL

07:11.738 --> 07:14.842
PIPELINES, THE END BRIDGE LINE
THREE PIPELINE.

07:14.942 --> 07:19.749
LINE THREE HAS FACED INTENSE
TESTS FROM TRIBAL GROUPS TO SAY

07:19.849 --> 07:26.525
THE PIPELINE POSES RISK TO
WATERWAYS AND WETLANDS.

07:26.626 --> 07:30.732
>> THIS IS OUR LAND.
WE GAVE YOU THE RIGHT TO BE

07:30.832 --> 07:31.299
HERE.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.205
>> OVER 100 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
ARRESTED IN ACTS OF CIVIL

07:35.305 --> 07:38.175
DISOBEDIENCE AS RECENTLY AS LAST
NIGHT.

07:38.276 --> 07:41.079
ACTIVISTS CHAINED THEMSELVES
INSIDE PART OF THE PIPELINE AND

07:41.179 --> 07:49.091
WERE LATER ARRESTED BY THE
POLICE.

07:49.191 --> 07:53.096
>> RIGHT NOW WE ARE WALKING TO
THE PLACE WHERE THERE'S FOLKS

07:53.196 --> 07:55.333
THAT CRAWLED INTO ONE OF THE
PIPES YESTERDAY.

07:55.433 --> 07:56.335
>> HOW LONG WERE THEY IN THE
PIPE?

07:56.435 --> 08:02.977
>> THE WHOLE DAY.
IT HIT 17 BELOW.

08:03.077 --> 08:03.478
IT WAS CHILLY.

08:03.578 --> 08:04.479
>> THE CONSIDERED

08:04.579 --> 08:05.982
>> THE CONSIDIDEA WAS TO BLOCK R
CONSTRUCTION.

08:06.082 --> 08:07.750
>> YEP.
NOT ONLY BLOCKING CONSTRUCTION

08:07.850 --> 08:12.057
FOR THAT DAY BUT SHOWING AND
DEMONSTRATING IN A REAL WAY THAT

08:12.157 --> 08:14.026
WE ARE WILLING TO TAKE THESE
RISKS FOR THE LAND AND FOR THE

08:14.126 --> 08:24.207
WATER.

08:25.543 --> 08:26.544
>> THIS IS IT.

08:26.644 --> 08:30.249
>> THIS IS IT.

08:30.350 --> 08:33.187
>> OVER 300 MILES OF THIS
PIPELINE IN THE STATE OF

08:33.287 --> 08:33.721
MINNESOTA, IS THAT RIGHT?

08:33.821 --> 08:35.523
>> YEP.

08:35.623 --> 08:38.260
>> YOU CAN SEE THEY ARE
TRENCHING.

08:38.361 --> 08:39.496
THEY WEREN'T TRENCHING THE OTHER
DAY.

08:39.596 --> 08:44.503
>> NOPE.

08:44.603 --> 08:47.040
>> IT'S BILLED AS A REPLACEMENT
PROJECT.

08:47.140 --> 08:49.243
BUT THEY'RE NOT REPLACING IT.
THEY'RE PUTTING IN A BRAND-NEW

08:49.343 --> 08:59.424
PLACE.

09:06.768 --> 09:10.073
>> THIS IS AN UNTOUCHED AREA
THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANY PIPELINES

09:10.173 --> 09:12.843
IN IT.
WE ARE TALKING OVER 200 BODIES

09:12.943 --> 09:16.581
OF WATER, 800 WETLANDS THAT THEY
ARE LOOKING AT DIGGING THROUGH

09:16.681 --> 09:21.522
AND DISRUPTING.
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

09:21.622 --> 09:24.727
ADDRESSING CLIMATE CRISIS IN THE
RADICAL WAY WE NEED TO ADDRESS

09:24.827 --> 09:25.194
IT.

09:25.961 --> 09:28.465
>> THE IDEA OF JOBS.
THAT'S THE ARGUMENT ON THE OTHER

09:28.565 --> 09:28.832
SIDE.

09:28.932 --> 09:29.600
>> RIGHT.

09:29.934 --> 09:33.038
>> THAT ANIMATES THE ARGUMENT
FOR ALL THIS.

09:33.138 --> 09:38.446
IT'S NOT JUST REPUBLICANS.
IT'S DEMOCRATS WHO FEEL LIKE

09:38.546 --> 09:39.581
THAT'S A CHOICE THEY HAVE TO
RECONCILE

09:39.681 --> 09:41.084
RECONC
RECONCILE.

09:41.184 --> 09:45.857
>> I'M BORN AND RAISED UP HERE.
IT SHOULDN'T BE A SITUATION

09:45.957 --> 09:49.028
WHERE YOU HAVE LOCAL PEOPLE
PITTED AGAINST EACH OTHER.

09:49.128 --> 09:52.332
SOMEHOW I'M AGAINST JOBS IN
NORTHERN MINNESOTA, THAT'S NOT

09:52.432 --> 09:55.771
THE CASE AT ALL.
I HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE

09:55.871 --> 09:56.638
MINERS.
THOSE ARE THE GOOD PAYING JOBS

09:56.738 --> 10:00.511
UP HERE.
THEN JUST LIKE MANY OTHER

10:00.611 --> 10:04.382
PLACES, THAT PIPELINE
INFRASTRUCTURE IS BILTD

10:04.483 --> 10:05.685
INFRASTRUCTURE IS BILUILT, THEY
BRING IN THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

10:05.785 --> 10:08.255
FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE TO BUILD IT.
IT'S EASIER TO DESTROY SOMETHING

10:08.355 --> 10:10.725
WHEN IT'S NOT YOURS, WHEN YOU
HAVE NO CONNECTION TO IT.

10:10.825 --> 10:14.798
RIGHT NOW, THERE'S 2,000 OUT OF
STATE WORKERS HERE IN NORTHERN

10:14.898 --> 10:18.136
MINNESOTA THAT ARE DESTROYING
OUR LAND, CUTTING THROUGH THE

10:18.236 --> 10:20.339
FOREST.
WE HAVE TO HAVE WATER.

10:20.439 --> 10:23.009
WE HAVE TO HAVE SOIL.
WE HAVE TO HAVE CLEAN AIR TO

10:23.109 --> 10:25.813
BREATHE, OTHERWISE, WE CAN'T
LIVE.

10:25.913 --> 10:28.985
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW AT THIS
POINT WHERE YOU HAVE PEOPLE

10:29.085 --> 10:32.623
ENGAGING IN CLIMATE MIGRATION,
FLEEING CLIMATE CHANGE, FLEEING

10:32.723 --> 10:40.333
RISING SEAS AND EXTREME WEATHER,
PROFIT MARGINS AND EXTRACTIVE

10:40.433 --> 10:52.685
ECONOMY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN
LIFE ITSELF?

10:54.620 --> 10:58.826
>> WE'RE HAVING THIS BIG
CONVERSATION ABOUT CLIMATE.

10:58.927 --> 11:00.696
RIGHT?
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO.

11:00.796 --> 11:04.201
BIDEN COMES INTO OFFICE, DAY
ONE, CANCELED THE PERMIT FOR

11:04.301 --> 11:05.836
KEYSTONE.
DID THAT SURPRISE YOU?

11:05.937 --> 11:06.204
>> IT DID.

11:06.304 --> 11:06.871
>> IT DID?

11:07.272 --> 11:11.411
>> IT DID.
YOU KNOW, I THINK HE DOES HAVE A

11:11.511 --> 11:15.517
REAL OPPORTUNITY TO BE THE
CLIMATE PRESIDENT.

11:15.617 --> 11:20.357
AND RIGHT NOW WHAT'S HAPPENING
IN TEXAS IS A REMINDER TO ALL OF

11:20.457 --> 11:23.628
US THAT A NATIONAL EMERGENCY
DECLARATION ON CLIMATE CRISIS

11:23.729 --> 11:28.368
NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE.
IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING RIGHT

11:28.469 --> 11:38.483
NOW, IT'S JUST GOING TO GET
WORSE.

11:38.583 --> 11:42.555
>> I WAS JUST AT LINE THREE
YESTERDAY OR PART OF IT.

11:42.655 --> 11:43.924
YOU WENT UP THERE RECENTLY?

11:44.024 --> 11:44.891
>> I DID.

11:45.360 --> 11:49.498
>> THERE HAVE BEEN TWO LAWSUITS
STOPPING THE PIPELINE THAT WERE

11:49.598 --> 11:51.301
DEFEATED IN COURT.
DO YOU FEEL LIKE THE OVAL OFFICE

11:51.401 --> 11:56.742
IS THE LAST BEST CHANCE TO STOP
END BRIDGE AT THIS POINT?

11:56.842 --> 12:00.881
>> IT IS.
IT DEFIES LOGIC TO CANCEL

12:00.981 --> 12:05.655
KEYSTONE AND TO NOT CANCEL THE
SMALLER PIPELINES.

12:05.755 --> 12:11.129
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO PUSH
UNTIL HE SAYS YES.

12:11.229 --> 12:14.868
>> YOU HAVE LABOR UNIONS WHO ARE
NOT ON BOARD WITH THESE PIPELINE

12:14.968 --> 12:17.338
CANCELLATIONS.

12:17.438 --> 12:23.246
>> THERE'S A LOT OF FEAR,
PARTICULARLY NOW, GIVEN THE

12:23.347 --> 12:27.018
ECONOMIC SPIRAL WE'RE IN, THE
QUESTION OF JOBS AND LIVELIHOOD

12:27.118 --> 12:31.491
IS SO EMOTIONAL FOR PEOPLE.

12:31.591 --> 12:32.693
>> FEAR CAN BE DEBILITATE

12:32.793 --> 12:35.798
>> FEAR CAN BE DEBILITATING.
IT CAN STOP YOU FROM TRYING OR

12:35.898 --> 12:37.934
DOING ANYTHING.
AS AN IMMIGRANT, I KNOW THIS

12:38.034 --> 12:45.445
VERY WELL.
IF MY PARENTS USED THE FEAR OF

12:45.545 --> 12:48.349
FLEEING TO SOMETHING DIFFERENT,
THAN THEY WOULD HAVE STAY AND WE

12:48.449 --> 12:56.526
MIGHT NOT HAVE LIVED.
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE

12:56.626 --> 12:57.495
LEAP OF FAITH.

12:57.595 --> 13:04.438
>> WHAT ABOUT OTHER DEMOCRATS?

13:04.538 --> 13:10.146
>> WE NEED TO DIAL IT BACK.
LET'S WORK ACROSS THE AISLE.

13:10.246 --> 13:12.149
THAT'S VERY MUCH THE JOE BIDEN
MODEL.

13:12.249 --> 13:15.420
DO YOU WORRY ABOUT THOSE
LAWMAKERS?

13:15.520 --> 13:23.565
>> I HOPE THEY WILL COME TO THE
REALIZATION THAT WE CAN'T SEEK

13:23.665 --> 13:28.172
BIPARTISANSHIP AND OBSTRUCT
EVERY OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE FOR

13:28.272 --> 13:30.809
PROGRESS.
THE COUNTRY VOTED FOR A

13:30.909 --> 13:38.219
DIFFERENT DIRECTION.
WE HAVE TO TAKE IT THERE.

13:38.319 --> 13:40.322
>> SINCE PRESIDENT BIDEN
ANNOUNCED HE WOULD BE STOPPING

13:40.423 --> 13:44.695
THE PERMIT TO BUILD THE KEYSTONE
XL PIPELINE, THERE'S BEEN

13:44.796 --> 13:47.232
WIDESPREAD OUTRAGE.

13:47.332 --> 13:51.438
>> THIS IS WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE.

13:51.538 --> 13:54.476
WE ARE IN WAY NORTH MONTANA.
WE ARE ON THE BORDER WITH

13:54.576 --> 13:59.349
CANADA.
THE PIPELINE WAS SUPPOSED TO

13:59.450 --> 14:03.054
CREATE 10,000 TO 11,000
CONSTRUCTION JOBS IN THE U.S.,

14:03.154 --> 14:07.260
$100 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL
REVENUE TO COUNTIES AND STATES.

14:07.360 --> 14:12.201
THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR OF
MONTANA IS COMING TO THIS AREA

14:12.301 --> 14:14.604
TO DO A COMMUNITY MEETING IN
SUPPORT OF KEYSTONE AND TO TRY

14:14.704 --> 14:18.443
TO REVIVE THE PROJECT.

14:18.543 --> 14:23.984
>> THIS KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE IS
REALLY CRITICAL FOR THIS

14:24.084 --> 14:27.121
COMMUNITY.
I'M GOING TO SPEND TIME HERE

14:27.222 --> 14:27.790
LISTENING.

14:28.557 --> 14:32.330
>> IT'S JUST AN ENORMOUS AFFECT
ON ALL THE COUNTIES IN MONTANA.

14:32.430 --> 14:36.802
I GREW UP IN A PIPELINE FAMILY.
I SEE THE EFFECTS IT HAS ON THE

14:36.903 --> 14:39.340
COMMUNITY.
THESE PEOPLE COME IN, A LOT

14:39.440 --> 14:41.642
BRING THEIR FAMILIES.
WHEN THEIR FAMILIES COME HERE,

14:41.743 --> 14:44.080
THEY WILL SHOP HERE, THEY WILL
SPEND MONEY HERE.

14:44.180 --> 14:49.220
>> THE ECONOMIC BOOST HERE WOULD
REALLY KEEP GLASCO AFLOAT.

14:49.320 --> 14:52.858
WE HAVE A LOT OF RESTAURANTS,
BARS

14:52.958 --> 14:54.694
BAR S BARS, FRONT LINE EMPLOYEES

14:54.794 --> 14:55.428
STRUGGLING.

14:55.929 --> 14:58.834
>> I HAVE TO LOOK AT THE
FINANCIAL END OF THE SCHOOL

14:58.934 --> 15:04.441
DISTRICT AND SEE IF WE CAN
CONTINUE TO HIRE TEACHERS, IF WE

15:04.542 --> 15:05.744
EVEN HAVE THAT AS AN OPTION.

15:05.844 --> 15:09.282
>> I WISH MORE PEOPLE HAD THEIR
EYES OPENED HOW BIG THIS AFFECTS

15:09.382 --> 15:14.989
OUR SCHOOLS, OUR POWER
COMPANIES, TO SEE WHAT A HUGE

15:15.090 --> 15:19.763
IMPACT ONE BAD DECISION CAN MAKE
ON A RURAL AMERICA.

15:19.864 --> 15:25.972
>> WHEN HE SAID BUILD BACK
BETTER, IT WAS JUST A SOUND

15:26.072 --> 15:27.741
BITE.
WHEN YOU STOP TALKING TO THE

15:27.841 --> 15:31.012
MEDIA AND START ACTUALLY BACKING
THE WORDS THAT HE CAMPAIGNED ON.

15:31.112 --> 15:37.488
>> PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT ARE
TAKING CONTROL OF THIS THAT HAS

15:37.589 --> 15:42.762
NO TOUCH WITH US, WITH OUR AREA.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE JOHN TESTER

15:42.862 --> 15:45.099
STANDS ON THIS.
WE NEED YOU, EVERYONE'S SUPPORT

15:45.199 --> 15:55.648
TO GET THIS PUSHED THROUGH.

15:58.986 --> 16:07.397
>> THOSE TWO GUYS STUCK, THAT
WERE WITH THE YARDS OFF THE HIG

16:07.497 --> 16:08.032
>> STUCK?

16:08.132 --> 16:08.766
>> STUCK.

16:09.433 --> 16:12.739
>> WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WE GOT
ONE OF OUR VEHICLES STUCK IN THE

16:12.839 --> 16:15.275
VERY SNOWY ROAD.

16:15.376 --> 16:18.780
>> I JUST DON'T THINK YOU WILL
GET IT OUT WITHOUT A TRACTOR.

16:18.880 --> 16:21.317
>> YOU ARE GOING TO GET YOUR
TRACTOR FOR US?

16:21.417 --> 16:23.520
>> IT'S THAT OR LEAVE IT THERE
UNTIL SPRING.

16:23.620 --> 16:29.829
SPRING IS NOT FAR AWAY THOUGH.

16:29.929 --> 16:32.066
>> YOUR FRONT WHEELS ARE
TURNING.

16:32.166 --> 16:37.940
THEY'RE TURNING.
THEY'RE TURNING.

16:38.041 --> 16:48.122
YEAH!

16:49.791 --> 16:51.460
YOU WORRY ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE?

16:51.560 --> 16:55.700
>> NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.
I WORRY ABOUT IT AS A FARMER.

16:55.800 --> 17:00.239
I HAVE SEEN WHAT HAPPENED ON
THIS PLACE IN THE LAST 40 YEARS.

17:00.339 --> 17:05.613
I HAVE SEEN HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS
GO OUT THE DOOR FOR NATURAL

17:05.714 --> 17:07.616
DISASTER.
WE HAVE TO MAKE POSITIVE

17:07.717 --> 17:08.250
CHANGES.

17:08.951 --> 17:13.324
>> TELL US WHY YOU SUPPORT THE
CONSTRUCTION OF THE KEYSTONE

17:13.424 --> 17:13.991
PIPELINE.

17:14.292 --> 17:15.360
>> ENERGY INDEPENDENCE IS
IMPORTANT.

17:15.461 --> 17:20.234
WE ARE NOT WHERE WE NEED TO BE
FROM A RENEWABLE ENERGY

17:20.334 --> 17:23.338
STANDPOINT.
WHEN I FILL MY TRACTOR, I WILL

17:23.438 --> 17:28.579
THROW A COUPLE HUNDRED GALLONS
OF DIESEL.

17:28.680 --> 17:31.283
IT CREATES AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT
OF TAX BASE FOR COUNTIES THAT

17:31.383 --> 17:33.587
NEED THAT TAX BASE.

17:33.687 --> 17:37.391
>> DO YOU THINK IT WAS A MISTAKE
FOR BIDEN TO LEAD OFF WITH THE

17:37.492 --> 17:38.192
KEYSTONE CANCELLATION?

17:38.293 --> 17:44.135
>> IF I WOULD HAVE HAD MY
DRUDGERS

17:44.235 --> 17:45.302
DRUDGDRUDGE DRUDGDRU

17:45.403 --> 17:48.341
DRUTHERS, TALK TO BOTH SIDES.
TALK TO THE REGULAR PEOPLE

17:48.441 --> 17:52.513
IMPACTED BY THIS AND TALK ABOUT
HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD IN A WAY

17:52.614 --> 17:53.615
THAT MAKES SENSE.

17:53.715 --> 17:56.085
>> YOU ARE A DEMOCRAT.
YOU WANT JOE BIDEN TO SUCCEED.

17:56.185 --> 17:56.919
>> I DO.

17:57.354 --> 17:59.724
>> IF HE GOES TOO BIG ON
CLIMATE, IS THAT SOMETHING YOU

17:59.824 --> 18:00.525
WILL OPPOSE?

18:00.625 --> 18:04.062
>> DEPENDS WHAT HE DOES ON
CLIMATE.

18:04.163 --> 18:06.766
>> SCIENTISTS SAY THERE ARE
SEVEN YEARS LEFT.

18:06.867 --> 18:11.072
IF WE DON'T FIGURE IT OUT,
CATASTROPHIC IMPACT FOR THE

18:11.173 --> 18:14.111
CLIMATE.
WE HAVE TO GO REALLY BIG.

18:14.211 --> 18:16.414
IF YOU ARE TOO CAUTIOUS, IT'S
NOT GOING TO MATTER.

18:16.514 --> 18:19.118
>> HERE IS THE POINT.
I GET IT.

18:19.218 --> 18:22.756
I UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE
SAYING.

18:22.856 --> 18:27.429
ARE WE GOING TO SHUT THE SPIGOT
OFF ON THE GAS PUMPS?

18:27.529 --> 18:31.268
WE'RE GOING TO SHUT IT OFF?
IF WE'RE GOING TO SHUT IT OFF,

18:31.368 --> 18:33.572
I'M OUT.
WE'RE NOT WHERE WE NEED TO BE.

18:33.672 --> 18:36.742
WHAT I DO HERE AND WHAT I'M
PROUD OF AND WHAT MY GRANDFATHER

18:36.843 --> 18:40.348
DID BEFORE ME AND MY PARENTS
BEFORE ME IS RAISE FOOD.

18:40.448 --> 18:42.383
IT'S JUST NOT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO
LIVE IN THAT HOUSE.

18:42.483 --> 18:45.488
IT'S FOR EVERYBODY IN THIS
COUNTRY.

18:45.589 --> 18:50.229
I'M TELLING YOU, IF I DON'T HAVE
IS JUICE TO PUT IN THE TRACTOR,

18:50.329 --> 18:52.866
I DON'T HAVE HORSES TO GO OUT
AND PLOW THE GROUND, IT WOULDN'T

18:52.966 --> 18:56.136
WORK IF I DID.
YOU CAN'T JUST SAY, WE'RE GOING

18:56.237 --> 18:58.807
TO SHUT OFF THE VALVE AND PEOPLE
WILL ADAPT.

18:58.907 --> 19:02.212
I GOT NEWS FOR YOU.
I WILL BE BROKE BEFORE I CAN

19:02.312 --> 19:03.347
ADAPT.
THAT'S THE POINT.

19:03.447 --> 19:07.553
THE POINT IS, I UNDERSTAND IT.
I AGREE WITH THEM 100%.

19:07.653 --> 19:10.156
TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE.
WE NEED TO PUT MONEY INTO

19:10.257 --> 19:13.461
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.
WE NEED TO MOVE PAST CARBON

19:13.561 --> 19:21.139
FUEL.
WE ARE NOT THERE YET.

19:21.239 --> 19:25.177
>> BIG GOALS FOR GENERAL MOTORS.
THEY WANT TO MAKE THE VAST

19:25.278 --> 19:27.814
MAJORITY OF ITS VEHICLES
ELECTRIC BY 2035.

19:27.915 --> 19:33.023
>> A BIG PART OF THE CLIMATE
PROBLEM IS ELECTRIC CARBON GASES

19:33.123 --> 19:38.697
FROM GASOLINE POWERED
AUTOMOBILES.

19:38.797 --> 19:41.601
FORD MOTOR COMPANY, THIS WEEK
ANNOUNCED THAT IN EUROPE, WITHIN

19:41.701 --> 19:44.038
TEN YEARS, THEY WILL BE ALL
ELECTRIC.

19:44.138 --> 19:47.042
ALL OF WHICH IS GOOD NEWS FOR
JOE BIDEN AND HIS BIG PLANS ON

19:47.143 --> 19:50.914
CLIMATE.
I'M VERY EXCITED.

19:51.014 --> 19:52.583
I HAVE NEVER DRIVEN AN ELECTRIC
CAR.

19:52.684 --> 19:52.884
>> REALLY?

19:52.984 --> 19:54.553
>> NO.

19:54.653 --> 20:04.567
>> IS THERE A TRICK TO GETTING
INTO GEAR?

20:04.667 --> 20:06.403
>> NO KEY -- THERE'S NO KEY.

20:06.503 --> 20:16.884
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

20:18.487 --> 20:21.658
>> HAMMER IT WHEN WE CAN.
YOU WILL SEE THE ACCELERATION IS

20:21.758 --> 20:24.428
DRAMATICALLY ENHANCED.

20:24.528 --> 20:24.762
>> WHOA.

20:24.862 --> 20:25.430
>> YEAH.

20:25.764 --> 20:28.334
>> THIS FEELS LIKE A
CONVENTIONAL CAR.

20:28.434 --> 20:29.202
>> MUSTANG.

20:29.302 --> 20:38.882
>> FEELS LIKE A RACE CAR.
IS IT THE RE

20:38.982 --> 20:40.118
IS IT THE --

20:40.218 --> 20:44.089
>> THEY SAY, NEVER ELECTRIFY MY
COUPE.

20:44.189 --> 20:48.696
THERE'S A NEW GROUP WHO ARE
SAYING, I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE

20:48.796 --> 20:56.908
THAT.
WHERE HE NOT GOING TO CEDE TO

20:57.008 --> 20:58.944
ANYONE.
IT HAS TO BE CONNECTED TO

20:59.045 --> 21:06.855
ELECTRIFIED PRODUCTS.
WE DIDN'T WANT SUBCOMPACT STUFF.

21:06.955 --> 21:11.228
WE WANTED GOOD IF YOU HAVE.

21:11.328 --> 21:13.565
>> MACHO TRUCKS ARE ELECTRIFIED.
CONSUMERS WILL BUY THAT?

21:13.665 --> 21:17.036
>> FULL-SIZE TRUCK CUSTOMERS
WANT TO BE PART OF THE FUTURE

21:17.136 --> 21:19.673
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.
IF THE MATH IS BET ARE FOR AN

21:19.773 --> 21:21.476
ELECTRIC VEHICLE, THEY WILL
SWITCH.

21:21.576 --> 21:24.713
WE ANNOUNCED IN EUROPE, WE WILL
GO ALL ELECTRIC IN THE NEXT FEW

21:24.814 --> 21:25.282
YEARS.

21:25.649 --> 21:26.783
>> HOW SOON WILL YOU DO THAT
HERE?

21:26.883 --> 21:30.989
>> IT WILL DEPEND ON THE BIDEN
ADMINISTRATION AND WHAT THEIR

21:31.090 --> 21:32.225
PRIORITIES ARE.

21:32.325 --> 21:35.396
>> BLUE SKY, IF COULD YOU WALK
INTO PRESIDENT BIDEN'S OFFICE

21:35.496 --> 21:39.669
AND SAY, HERE ARE THE TOP THREE,
FOUR, FIVE THINGS TO DO, WHAT

21:39.769 --> 21:41.170
WOULD THEY DO.

21:41.270 --> 21:44.375
>> CHARGING STATIONS FOR RETAIL,
SO YOU CAN GO ON VACATION WITH

21:44.476 --> 21:48.347
YOUR ELECTRIC CAR, BUT
COMMERCIAL VEHICLE

21:48.447 --> 21:50.617
INFRASTRUCTURE.
NON-MONETARY INCENTIVES.

21:50.717 --> 21:55.757
MORE PEOPLE LOOK AT THE
TECHNOLOGY.

21:55.858 --> 21:58.429
AND I THINK THAT THE OTHER ONE
IS, LET'S BRING TECHNOLOGY HERE

21:58.529 --> 21:59.997
TO AMERICA.

22:00.097 --> 22:04.770
>> ARE YOU ENCOURAGED BY WHAT
YOU HAVE SEEN AND HEARD SO FAR?

22:04.871 --> 22:05.806
>> SO FAR.
BUT IT'S THE EARLY DAYS.

22:05.906 --> 22:08.276
>> THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WILL
FACE RESISTANCE.

22:08.376 --> 22:13.750
>> I THINK THEY HAVE A VERY
AGGRESSIVE CO2 ENERGY POLICY.

22:13.850 --> 22:18.257
FORD, DURING THE TRUMP YEARS, WE
COMMITTED TO PARIS AND

22:18.357 --> 22:20.693
CALIFORNIA STANDARD.
MOST OF OUR COMPETITORS DIDN'T.

22:20.793 --> 22:23.197
IT WAS UNPOPULAR THEN.

22:23.297 --> 22:27.103
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID, HENRY
FORD WOULD BE DISAPPOINTED AND

22:27.203 --> 22:27.737
ROLLING OVER.
WOULD HE BE?

22:27.837 --> 22:32.210
>> NO.
NO.

22:32.310 --> 22:34.213
MR. FORD WAS ALWAYS ABOUT
PROGRESS.

22:34.313 --> 22:40.521
I THINK HE WOULD BE VERY EXCITED
ABOUT THE MUSTANG OR THE F-150

22:40.621 --> 22:43.125
ELECTRIC.
HE WOULD BE SAYING, GO FASTER,

22:43.225 --> 22:43.626
JIM.

22:44.360 --> 22:47.464
>> WHAT WE WILL SEE FROM
PRESIDENT BIDEN IS HIS MOST

22:47.565 --> 22:49.401
EXTENSIVE FOREIGN POLICY
ENGAGEMENT TO DATE.

22:49.501 --> 22:56.277
HE WILL LAY OUT FOREIGN POLICY
GOALS IN AN ADDRESS TO THE

22:56.377 --> 23:02.185
MUNICH SECURITY CONFERENCE.

23:02.285 --> 23:07.794
>> THE BIGGEST NEWS OF THE DAY
IN YOUR REALM IS JOE BIDEN

23:07.894 --> 23:11.865
ADDRESSING THE MUNICH SECURITY
CONFERENCE AHEAD OF YOUR

23:11.966 --> 23:14.870
COLLEAGUE JOHN KERRY WHO WILL
FORMALIZE THE REENTRY OF THE

23:14.971 --> 23:17.274
UNITED STATES INTO THE PARIS
CLIMATE ACCORD.

23:17.374 --> 23:19.076
BIDEN IN HIS REMARKS SAID --

23:19.176 --> 23:26.654
>> WE CAN NO LONGER DELAY OR DO
THE MINIMUM TO ADDRESS CLIMATE

23:26.754 --> 23:31.394
CHANGE.
THIS IS AN EXISTENTIAL CRISIS.

23:31.494 --> 23:35.399
>> THE COUNTRIES NEED TO HOLD
EACH OTHER ACCOUNTABLE FOR

23:35.499 --> 23:38.671
CURBING EMISSIONS.
ONE WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE IN

23:38.771 --> 23:42.376
PRACTICE?
THE OTHER IS, IF YOU HEARD FROM

23:42.476 --> 23:45.179
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, HAVING
WATCHED AMERICA DROP OUT OF

23:45.280 --> 23:48.685
PARIS AND NOW COME BACK IN AND
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES SAID, YOU

23:48.785 --> 23:52.858
DROPPED OUT, YOU ARE JUST BACK,
HOW DARE YOU LECTURE US ABOUT

23:52.958 --> 23:53.725
ACCOUNTABILITY.

23:54.259 --> 23:57.497
>> IF YOU LISTEN TO PRESIDENT
BIDEN'S REMARKS, YOU WILL SEE WE

23:57.598 --> 24:00.335
KNOW WE HAVE TO BE HUMBLE.
HOW DO YOU GET OVER THE PAST

24:00.435 --> 24:02.203
FOUR YEARS?
WE HAVE TURNED A PAGE.

24:02.304 --> 24:13.453
EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE GREAT.
THE PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT WAS

24:13.553 --> 24:15.489
GOOD.
BUT NO COUNTRIES ARE REALLY

24:15.589 --> 24:18.093
MEETING THOSE COMMITMENTS AS
YET.

24:18.193 --> 24:20.930
WE'RE KIND OF ALL IN THE SAME
BOAT.

24:21.030 --> 24:26.472
PART OF THE JOB THAT I HAVE IS
TO MAKE SURE THAT DOMESTICALLY,

24:26.572 --> 24:29.676
WE MAKE A REALLY STRONG
COMMITMENT.

24:29.776 --> 24:33.081
WE HAVE TO DO THAT SOON.
SO THAT IT'S NOT JUST, WE'RE

24:33.181 --> 24:35.250
BACK, BUT WHAT ARE WE BRINGING
WITH US?

24:35.351 --> 24:39.623
>> YOU DID A BUNCH OF STUFF.
KEYSTONE, DAY ONE.

24:39.724 --> 24:44.197
KEYSTONE, TO OUR DOMESTIC
POLITICS, IT'S POLARIZING AND

24:44.297 --> 24:46.200
SYMBOLIC.
YOU HAVE THE JOHN TESTERS OF THE

24:46.300 --> 24:50.840
WORLD AND THE LABOR MOVEMENT
VOCALLY OPPOSING YOUR DECISION

24:50.940 --> 24:54.044
AND KIND OF CHALLENGING, WHY DID
YOU HAVE TO DO THIS DAY ONE.

24:54.144 --> 24:59.017
>> I WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED THAT
PEOPLE WERE OUTRAGED BY IT.

24:59.118 --> 25:03.891
I GET THAT IT'S BEEN AN ISSUE
THAT HAD POLARIZED PEOPLE.

25:03.991 --> 25:07.330
JOE BIDEN HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT
BEING AGAINST KEYSTONE SINCE HE

25:07.430 --> 25:11.569
WAS IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.
I THINK THAT WHAT PEOPLE WORRY

25:11.669 --> 25:15.141
ABOUT IS THAT EVERY PIPELINE NOW
IS GOING TO END UP IN THE SAME

25:15.241 --> 25:15.975
PLACE.
THAT WAS NOT THE SIGNAL TO TAKE

25:16.075 --> 25:17.444
AWAY.

25:17.544 --> 25:20.448
>> I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT.
A LOT OF PEOPLE -- NOT JUST THE

25:20.548 --> 25:25.755
ENERGY STATE DEMOCRATS WORRIED
ABOUT JOBS, BUT AL GORES OF THE

25:25.856 --> 25:28.460
WORLD, THEY ARE LIKE, THIS IS
PRECEDENT.

25:28.560 --> 25:33.767
IF YOU ARE AGAINST KEYSTONE, YOU
HAVE TO BE AGAINST DAKOTA, END

25:33.867 --> 25:34.368
BRIDGE.

25:35.068 --> 25:36.070
>> WE WILL LOOK AT THEM
INDIVIDUALLY FOR WHAT THEY BRING

25:36.171 --> 25:39.241
TO THE TABLE AND WHAT DON'T THEY
BRING TO THE TABLE.

25:39.341 --> 25:44.015
WE ARE NOT INTENDING TO USE THIS
AS A WAY TO KILL EVERYTHING.

25:44.115 --> 25:47.152
I'M NOT FIGHTING FOSSIL FUELS AS
MUCH AS I'M FIGHTING FOR CLEAN

25:47.252 --> 25:52.794
ENERGY.
WE GOTTA GROW JOBS IN THE PLACES

25:52.894 --> 25:56.032
WHERE IT'S CONSISTENT WITH
MOVING FORWARD.

25:56.132 --> 25:59.504
>> IF WE'RE BEING HONEST, THE
JOE BIDEN SENATE CAREER WAS

25:59.604 --> 26:01.674
DEFINED BY JUDICIARY AND FOREIGN
AFFAIRS.

26:01.774 --> 26:08.784
WE LOOK AT AL GORE, PASSIONATE
FROM 1976.

26:08.884 --> 26:13.858
JOHN KERRY.
NOT A DEFINING ISSUE FOR JOE

26:13.958 --> 26:15.726
BIDEN'S CAREER.
I ASK YOU, HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN

26:15.826 --> 26:19.899
THAT IT HAS BECOME AN ISSUE ON
WHICH HE NOW IS STAKING HIS

26:19.999 --> 26:22.736
LEGACY, THAT HE MADE MOVES THAT
THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS ARE

26:22.836 --> 26:26.475
LIKE, THIS IS THE GUY, WE HAVE
BEEN WAITING FOR YEARS, BUT NO

26:26.575 --> 26:30.715
ONE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE JOE
BIDEN.

26:30.815 --> 26:31.849
>> NO.
BECAUSE THAT WASN'T WHERE HE WAS

26:31.949 --> 26:33.519
FOCUSING HIS ATTENTION.
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.

26:33.619 --> 26:37.090
THIS IS THE WAY I WOULD EXPLAIN
IT IS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE ISN'T

26:37.190 --> 26:41.396
ABOUT THE PLANET.
IT'S ABOUT THE PEOPLE.

26:41.496 --> 26:46.770
IT'S ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO LIVE A
HEALTHY AND SAFE LIFE.

26:46.870 --> 26:50.442
JOE BIDEN IS A PEOPLE PERSON.
HE WENT INTO GOVERNMENT BECAUSE

26:50.543 --> 26:52.746
HE CARED ABOUT PEOPLE AND HE
STILL DOES.

26:52.846 --> 26:58.320
SO HIS ENTIRE VALUES HAVE LED
HIM TO THIS PLACE.

26:58.420 --> 27:01.090
>> THERE'S NO DOUBT IN YOUR MIND
THAT THIS IS LIKE OUR LAST

27:01.190 --> 27:03.027
CHANCE, RIGHT?
PEOPLE SAY, LAST BEST CHANCE.

27:03.127 --> 27:06.632
IT SEEMS LIKE LAST CHANCE IF WE
REALLY DON'T MAKE SIGNIFICANT

27:06.732 --> 27:10.537
PROGRESS IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS,
WE ARE SORT OF FUCKED.

27:10.637 --> 27:13.309
>> THIS COULD BE THE LAST BIG
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO GET THIS

27:13.409 --> 27:18.082
RIGHT.
I'M A CONSTANT OPTIMISM.

27:18.182 --> 27:21.186
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU, WE
WILL FALL OFF A CLIFF.

27:21.286 --> 27:25.559
I WILL TELL YOU THAT IF WE MISS
THIS OPPORTUNITY, WE DO IT TO

27:25.659 --> 27:30.533
THE DETRIMENT OF OUR FAMILIES
AND KIDS' FUTURE.

27:30.633 --> 27:35.406
IT'S IMPORTANT TO INVEST IN A
CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE NOW IF WE

27:35.506 --> 27:38.310
EXPECT TO RETURN TO A HEALTHY,
SAFE AND SECURE AND EQUITABLE

27:38.410 --> 27:45.554
FUTURE.
WE SHOULD BE ALL IN.
