01:26.619 --> 01:30.988
We're not... who... we are.

01:36.696 --> 01:39.995
We're not... who... we are.

01:44.637 --> 01:46.730
It goes no further than this.

01:50.376 --> 01:52.435
It stops right here...

01:53.580 --> 01:55.639
right now.

04:08.481 --> 04:10.540
Team Captain John Richter here.

04:10.650 --> 04:13.141
It's been a couple of frustrating months.

04:13.253 --> 04:18.384
But after a lot of stick-with-it-ness,
we're proud to report that half an hour ago,

04:18.491 --> 04:22.484
we broke the previous record
for drilling down into an ice sheet.

04:24.464 --> 04:28.400
This team of scientists
made up the Arctic Ice Core Project.

04:28.501 --> 04:33.268
They were sent to Alaska by the Advanced
Research Project Agency a year ago

04:33.339 --> 04:35.307
to drill into the arctic ice.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.807
The samples they removed

04:37.910 --> 04:41.368
contained trapped gases, dust, chemicals.

04:41.481 --> 04:46.316
Evidence that could reveal the structure of
the Earth's climate back to the dawn of man.

04:46.386 --> 04:48.980
Their work was a success, nearly completed.

04:49.088 --> 04:53.081
No reports or indications
of problems of any kind.

04:53.159 --> 04:56.287
Until, only a week later,
this next transmission.

05:02.635 --> 05:06.833
We're not... who... we are.

05:11.911 --> 05:16.644
We're not... who... we are.

05:19.352 --> 05:21.912
It goes no further than this.

05:23.456 --> 05:26.721
It stops... right here...

05:27.660 --> 05:29.992
right now.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.927
What happened up there?

05:37.003 --> 05:41.167
So far nobody's been able to reach
the compound because of bad weather.

05:41.240 --> 05:46.473
Obviously we must be brilliant or expendable
because we've pulled the assignment.

05:46.579 --> 05:48.638
It is severe isolation distress?

05:48.748 --> 05:54.152
These were top geophysicists, trained
and screened for this project in every way,

05:54.220 --> 05:56.620
including psychological makeup.

05:56.689 --> 06:02.025
We leave for Nome today. We'll join three
scientists familiar with the Ice Core Project,

06:02.095 --> 06:05.360
and then head north up to the Icy Cape.

06:05.431 --> 06:10.630
The National Weather Service gives us three
days to get in and out before the next storm.

06:10.703 --> 06:12.830
Bring your mittens.

06:23.616 --> 06:28.883
Here's the snap. Fouts dumps it across
to Winslow! Touchdown!

06:28.988 --> 06:31.855
Touchdown! Fouts... is... God!

06:35.228 --> 06:37.287
Sorry. My team scored.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.627
There's no football on Wednesdays.

06:39.699 --> 06:41.826
Fouts retired in '87, didn't he?

06:41.901 --> 06:45.234
No, this is just
my all-time favorite plays on tape.

06:46.606 --> 06:50.303
- You two FBI?
- Agent Mulder, Agent Scully. And you?

06:50.410 --> 06:53.072
Denny Murphy.
Professor of Geology, UC San Diego.

06:53.146 --> 06:56.240
San Diego? Get much chance
to study ice down there?

06:56.315 --> 06:57.839
Just what's around the cake.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.312
Dr Da Silva? Dr Hodge?

07:02.422 --> 07:04.481
Yeah. Sorry we're late.

07:04.557 --> 07:07.219
Agents Scully and Mulder. Doctor Murphy.

07:07.293 --> 07:09.227
Can I see some identification?

07:09.295 --> 07:13.254
- What for?
- Wanna make sure we are who we say we are.

07:17.236 --> 07:19.101
That's me.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.305
It's you.

07:22.375 --> 07:24.275
- That's me.
- Thanks a lot.

07:27.947 --> 07:32.384
Well, now that we know who we are,
anybody care to guess why we're going?

07:34.954 --> 07:40.722
Two federal agents, a geologist, a doctor and
a toxicologist. That should give us some idea.

07:40.793 --> 07:43.762
I assume you all took a look at the tape.

07:46.365 --> 07:49.095
- Something wrong?
- Come on. You're FBI.

07:49.168 --> 07:51.261
You have to know more than we do.

07:59.178 --> 08:01.544
You folks the ones goin' up to Icy Cape?

08:01.614 --> 08:04.811
- Yeah.
- Then I'm the one flyin' you.

08:04.951 --> 08:10.116
My name's Bear. The plane's across the way.
Provisions are loaded. Grab your gear.

08:10.189 --> 08:12.282
Can we see some credentials?

08:14.494 --> 08:16.359
Credentials?

08:17.797 --> 08:21.494
The only credentials I have is that
I'm the only pilot willing to fly you up there.

08:22.835 --> 08:25.167
You don't like those credentials,

08:25.238 --> 08:26.705
walk.

08:54.967 --> 08:57.629
Bear, see if you can get the power started.

08:59.405 --> 09:01.464
Anything to get out of here.

09:06.445 --> 09:08.538
Where do we start?

09:08.614 --> 09:10.673
The body bags are on the plane.

09:10.783 --> 09:15.220
Before we touch anything, we have to
thoroughly document the scene.

09:25.798 --> 09:27.595
Flashing.

09:40.813 --> 09:43.680
That's what they were drilling for.

09:45.818 --> 09:49.686
A quarter of a million years
melting away in a couple of days.

09:49.789 --> 09:51.848
I'm gonna preserve some samples.

10:14.880 --> 10:17.007
It's the generator.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.153
Agent Mulder!

10:43.643 --> 10:44.769
Hold on!

10:52.551 --> 10:54.075
Hold it down!

11:02.695 --> 11:05.493
That ought to keep him out for a while.

11:09.568 --> 11:12.469
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. He didn't break the skin.

11:12.538 --> 11:14.597
- Bear? Are you OK?
- He got me.

11:14.707 --> 11:18.734
- Get thatjacket off.
- Just gimme the stuff. I'll do it myself.

11:19.912 --> 11:21.971
Is it rabies?

11:27.219 --> 11:31.485
I don't see any indication
of glottal spasm or tetany.

11:31.557 --> 11:35.186
If it is rabies, it's not a strain I'm familiar with.

11:35.294 --> 11:37.762
Look at this. Black nodules.

11:37.830 --> 11:39.525
Swollen lymph nodes.

11:39.598 --> 11:41.930
Symptoms of bubonic plague.

11:42.001 --> 11:45.095
We'll do a blood test. We'll take it from there.

11:45.171 --> 11:47.503
This dog

11:47.573 --> 11:50.371
has got a skin irritation round its neck.

11:50.443 --> 11:53.708
Looks like it's been
scratching off its own hair.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.349
Look at this. Look at this!

12:00.720 --> 12:03.814
What... the hell... was that?

12:46.999 --> 12:50.958
From the autopsies, it's clear
these men killed one another.

12:51.036 --> 12:54.802
There are contusions around
the throat areas of three men,

12:54.874 --> 12:57.001
evidence of strangulation.

12:57.076 --> 12:59.806
Richter and Campbell killed themselves.

12:59.879 --> 13:02.439
I also found tissue damage due to fever.

13:03.215 --> 13:06.184
Did any of them have
the black spots the dog has?

13:06.252 --> 13:09.221
No. None of them had the black nodules.

13:09.288 --> 13:14.726
So... those spots didn't have anything to do
with those guys killin' each other, right?

13:14.827 --> 13:17.921
I wouldn't rule it out.
I just re-examined the dog.

13:18.030 --> 13:21.466
- The nodules are gone.
- What could that mean?

13:21.534 --> 13:26.028
It could mean the spots are a symptom
of some disease at an early stage.

13:56.869 --> 13:57.858
Denny?

13:58.838 --> 14:00.169
Denny.

14:01.707 --> 14:03.368
Denny. Sorry.

14:03.475 --> 14:05.875
The play-off game against Miami, '82.

14:05.945 --> 14:08.038
Helps me get my mind off stuff.

14:08.113 --> 14:13.312
My interpretation of satellite
remote sensing photos is a little rusty.

14:13.385 --> 14:15.478
All right. This is the Icy Cape area.

14:15.554 --> 14:21.925
It approximates the depth of the ice sheet
to be about... 3,000 meters thick.

14:21.994 --> 14:23.859
I also found this data.

14:23.929 --> 14:29.697
If I'm reading it correctly, the team actually
found the ice sheet to be twice that depth.

14:29.768 --> 14:33.670
That's very good. The numbers indicate
the topography to be concave.

14:33.739 --> 14:35.730
Looks like they were drilling
inside a meteor crater.

14:35.808 --> 14:37.901
No, it's impossible.

14:37.977 --> 14:40.878
- I analyzed two samples.
- What did you find?

14:40.946 --> 14:45.349
There seems to be a presence of
ammonium hydroxide in Richter's blood.

14:45.417 --> 14:49.751
It's not possible. Ammonia would
vaporize at human body temperature.

14:49.822 --> 14:52.416
I checked all the air filtration systems.

14:52.524 --> 14:55.493
- I found no evidence of any such toxins.
- I have.

14:56.495 --> 14:58.087
In the ice.

14:58.163 --> 14:59.824
And that's not all there is.

15:03.435 --> 15:07.496
I found a high ratio of
ammonia to water in the ice core.

15:07.573 --> 15:12.840
The Earth's atmosphere couldn't do that, not
even 1/4 million years ago. Look in the scope.

15:12.945 --> 15:17.041
Unless a foreign object
was introduced into that environment.

15:17.149 --> 15:20.016
Tell me that's not a foreign object.

15:20.119 --> 15:21.984
Oh! Scully.

15:25.557 --> 15:27.957
That same thing is in Richter's blood!

15:30.195 --> 15:35.360
What if that single-celled organism
is the larval stage of a larger animal?

15:37.736 --> 15:40.170
That's kind of a leap, don't you think?

15:41.173 --> 15:43.334
The evidence is there.

15:43.409 --> 15:46.003
Maybe the organism
somehow got into the men.

15:46.078 --> 15:50.174
Nothing can survive in sub-zero temperatures
for a quarter of a million years.

15:50.282 --> 15:52.842
Unless that's how it lives.

15:53.852 --> 15:57.344
Lookit, I don't see why
you're squabbling over some bug.

15:57.423 --> 16:00.859
You said your autopsy found
those men killed each other.

16:00.960 --> 16:04.020
That's it. I say let's get the hell out of here.

16:04.096 --> 16:06.394
I agree. We can have the bodies

16:06.465 --> 16:10.060
sent to a facility which can
make a definitive diagnosis.

16:10.169 --> 16:13.570
In the event that something
was missed, Agent Scully.

16:13.639 --> 16:17.097
If those bodies are infected,
we can't take them back.

16:17.209 --> 16:20.576
We can't go back without
proper quarantine procedures.

16:20.646 --> 16:25.709
- We can't risk bringing back the next plague.
- Say they did come down with something.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.787
We haven't, and I ain't
waitin' around until we do.

16:30.489 --> 16:33.583
I think it's safe to go back.
There's no reason why we'd be infected.

16:33.659 --> 16:36.822
- We took all the safeguards.
- The dog did bite Bear.

16:36.895 --> 16:39.887
- Itjumped Mulder, too!
- There's only one way to proceed!

16:39.999 --> 16:42.934
A doctor eliminates every possibility.

16:43.035 --> 16:46.027
We must determine if any of us is infected.

16:49.908 --> 16:52.809
All right. Parasitic diagnostic procedure

16:52.878 --> 16:56.211
requires us each to provide
a blood and a stool sample.

16:56.281 --> 16:58.476
A stool sample?

16:58.550 --> 17:01.713
Travel always makes that
kinda tough... for me.

17:01.820 --> 17:06.154
OK... Anybody got the morning
sports section handy?

17:07.960 --> 17:10.758
I ain't droppin' my cargo for no one.

17:10.863 --> 17:15.459
I'm gettin' my gear, gettin' my plane,
and flyin' the hell outta here!

17:15.534 --> 17:18.094
You can't go. The dog bit you.

17:19.304 --> 17:22.432
I got hired to fly you up here
and fly you back!

17:22.508 --> 17:26.968
No one said this might be part
of the deal, so the deal is over.

17:30.983 --> 17:32.848
We can't let him leave.

17:32.918 --> 17:35.512
- Who's gonna stop him?
- We have to.

17:35.587 --> 17:38.283
We can't risk infecting the population.

17:38.390 --> 17:40.585
He gets on that plane, I go with him.

17:40.692 --> 17:43.252
- We don't have time to argue.
- Take a vote.

17:43.328 --> 17:47.287
Who says we should confine Bear
until he agrees to an examination?

17:53.906 --> 17:55.965
All right.

17:58.410 --> 18:00.674
Bear, we just want to check you out.

18:00.746 --> 18:05.342
If we don't find any trace of
the parasite or the virus, we'll all go.

18:12.291 --> 18:14.350
All right.

18:14.493 --> 18:16.552
Gimme the damn jar.

18:29.975 --> 18:31.533
Murphy! Get a rope!

18:32.144 --> 18:33.805
Right.

18:37.149 --> 18:38.173
Here!

18:40.819 --> 18:42.548
Oh, my God!

18:46.625 --> 18:49.458
- Get my bag!
- What are you gonna do?!

18:49.561 --> 18:52.189
- Cut it out.
- We don't know enough about it.

18:52.264 --> 18:55.722
It's killing him!
Scully, help remove the skin.

18:59.538 --> 19:01.836
Hold still, Bear.

19:05.210 --> 19:07.269
Forceps.

19:12.251 --> 19:15.379
Hold still, Bear. One more second.
You're gonna be OK.

19:42.681 --> 19:46.515
This is the AICP investigative team
calling Doolittle Airfield. Come in.

19:46.618 --> 19:48.108
DAF responding.

19:48.220 --> 19:51.849
This is Agent Mulder.
We have a serious biological hazard.

19:51.924 --> 19:55.382
Request air pickup
and quarantine procedures. Over.

19:56.995 --> 19:59.020
Come in, Doolittle Airfield!

19:59.097 --> 20:03.591
We copy, Agent Mulder. We are under
a heavy storm. No aircraft can get out.

20:03.669 --> 20:07.105
The military base in Kotzebue
could set up a quarantine.

20:07.206 --> 20:11.108
Advise immediate evacuation.
The storm is heading your way. Over.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.678
We were told we'd have
three clear days of weather! Over!

20:13.745 --> 20:17.078
Welcome to the top of the world. Over.

20:18.250 --> 20:22.050
Is Bear in any condition to fly? If we don't
leave in an hour, we're stuck for days.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.686
He's dead.

20:46.678 --> 20:50.944
It's similar to a tapeworm.
It has a scolex with suckers and hooks.

20:51.049 --> 20:54.485
So it's familiar.
Something you can deal with.

20:54.586 --> 20:57.146
- What?
- No.

20:57.256 --> 21:00.919
Very different from any organism
at least that I know of.

21:00.993 --> 21:03.791
Have you figured out how it's transmitted?

21:03.895 --> 21:07.922
Exchange of fluids, touch, air?
All of the above? I don't know.

21:08.000 --> 21:12.164
All the other bodies had the creature.
Only this one is still alive.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.762
- All in the spine?
- No.

21:14.873 --> 21:19.071
It appears they were in
the hypothalamus gland deep in the brain.

21:19.144 --> 21:22.113
Hypothalamus? What was that again?

21:22.180 --> 21:24.614
It's a gland that secretes hormones.

21:24.716 --> 21:28.982
Although... I don't know why a parasite
would want to attach to it.

21:29.087 --> 21:31.715
Hypothalamus releases acetylcholine,

21:31.790 --> 21:35.123
which produces violent,
aggressive behavior.

21:35.193 --> 21:37.423
See, that might be the connection.

21:37.529 --> 21:41.932
Everybody that's been infected
certainly seems to act aggressively.

21:42.000 --> 21:47.199
Maybe the worm feeds on acetylcholine
and stops us controlling violent behavior.

21:47.306 --> 21:52.403
- A parasite shouldn't want to kill its host.
- It doesn't kill you until it's extracted.

21:52.511 --> 21:54.536
Then it releases a poison.

21:54.646 --> 21:58.514
So you're saying the worm
makes you wanna kill other people.

21:58.617 --> 22:01.552
Which is maybe what happened
to the first team.

22:01.653 --> 22:03.746
Or what could happen to us.

22:03.822 --> 22:07.986
- It's just a theory. We don't have any proof.
- Except five dead men.

22:08.060 --> 22:11.188
If the worm makes people
violently aggressive,

22:11.263 --> 22:14.426
why did Richter and Campbell
kill themselves?

22:14.533 --> 22:16.626
Maybe they did it to save us.

22:34.286 --> 22:39.155
I'm just... double-checking.
Making sure I didn't miss anything.

22:39.224 --> 22:41.283
Just some sleep, right?

22:42.894 --> 22:45.055
Sleep? I'm so tired, I can't sleep.

22:45.163 --> 22:50.191
We're all wired and hypersensitive.
It'll be good to get a fresh start tomorrow.

22:50.268 --> 22:54.500
Mulder, I don't want to waste a second
trying to find a way to kill this thing.

22:54.606 --> 22:56.699
I don't know if we should kill it.

22:58.377 --> 23:01.710
This area of the ice sheet
is formed over a meteor crater.

23:01.813 --> 23:05.715
The worm lives in ammonia.
It survived sub-zero temperatures.

23:05.817 --> 23:11.653
Theorists believe in ammonia-supported life
on planets with freezing temperatures.

23:11.723 --> 23:12.781
No.

23:12.858 --> 23:15.725
A meteor that crashed here
a quarter of a million years ago

23:15.827 --> 23:18.057
may have carried such life to Earth.

23:18.130 --> 23:22.658
Mulder, that pilot developed
surface symptoms within a few minutes.

23:22.734 --> 23:26.135
Within a few hours,
that parasite had total control.

23:26.238 --> 23:30.265
What would happen
if this got into the population?

23:30.342 --> 23:35.837
A city the size of New York
could be infected within a few days.

23:35.914 --> 23:38.109
Exactly. But what do we know about it?

23:38.216 --> 23:41.481
This organism might be
lying dormant in another crater.

23:41.553 --> 23:47.492
If we don't kill it now, we risk becoming
Richter and Campbell with guns to our heads.

23:47.559 --> 23:51.928
But if we do kill it now, we may never
know how to stop it in the future.

23:52.030 --> 23:54.965
Future? Mulder, how can you talk...

24:03.575 --> 24:05.702
Tell me it's hot in here.

24:05.777 --> 24:09.941
Don't worry, you don't have a fever.
The heating's malfunctioning.

24:10.048 --> 24:12.949
Outside it's 40 below, in here it's sweltering.

24:13.051 --> 24:17.545
- Can you hear what they're arguing about?
- Probably government secrets.

24:17.656 --> 24:20.716
You think they knew what was here
before we arrived?

24:21.493 --> 24:24.860
I'm sure of it.

24:24.930 --> 24:28.331
You know, Bear's infected blood
did get on Scully.

24:29.534 --> 24:31.900
It also got on you.

24:34.606 --> 24:39.134
They'd sacrifiice
not just evidence, but themselves!

24:39.211 --> 24:43.375
- How do you know it can't be contained?
- It can! By extermination!

24:43.482 --> 24:47.612
We should take those bodies, worms and all,
outside and incinerate them!

24:47.752 --> 24:50.118
Something going on
we should know about?

24:50.188 --> 24:52.122
Agent Scully, are you all right?

24:52.190 --> 24:56.388
- Yes. I'm fine. It's nothing.
- You seem a little bit stressed out.

25:00.198 --> 25:01.893
What the hell are you trying to say?!

25:01.967 --> 25:06.131
Let's settle down. It's been a long day.
We're all tired and scared.

25:06.204 --> 25:10.402
- Let's not turn on one another.
- At least, not without a good reason.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.704
Maybe we should all get some sleep.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.777
Are you kidding? You think
any of us could sleep right now?

25:16.848 --> 25:20.340
Come on, guys, let's face it.
We gotta check for spots.

25:20.418 --> 25:23.546
And any person who has them
should be confined.

25:24.823 --> 25:26.950
Are we agreed on that?

25:27.025 --> 25:28.993
Are you gonna do the exams?

25:29.060 --> 25:32.029
No! We do them in front of each other.

25:32.130 --> 25:34.189
No secrets.

25:39.971 --> 25:42.235
Before anyone passes judgment,

25:42.340 --> 25:44.865
may I remind you, we are in the Arctic.

26:13.838 --> 26:17.001
Sleep tight. Don't let the bedbugs bite.

26:17.075 --> 26:19.168
Yeah. Good night.

26:34.426 --> 26:35.984
Good night, Mulder.

26:37.095 --> 26:38.585
Good night, Scully.

26:39.230 --> 26:40.720
At least everyone's OK.

26:41.933 --> 26:43.093
Don't forget,

26:43.201 --> 26:45.066
the spots on the dog went away.

27:39.658 --> 27:43.389
The ball's on the three-yard line,

27:43.495 --> 27:46.055
with only 15 seconds left in the game.

27:46.131 --> 27:49.464
Fouts moves over the ball.
There's the snap!

30:28.893 --> 30:30.724
Mulder, what are you doing?

30:32.530 --> 30:34.327
Murphy's dead.

30:35.900 --> 30:38.630
- You killed him.
- I found him like this.

30:40.104 --> 30:43.073
I heard one of the doors close.
I came out to check it out.

30:44.976 --> 30:46.341
- It's one of you.
- He's lying.

30:46.411 --> 30:48.902
- You could've done it and not known.
- No, he said he didn't.

30:48.980 --> 30:50.345
I have no symptoms.

30:50.448 --> 30:52.507
- You checked him.
- Yeah, six hours ago!

30:52.584 --> 30:55.917
- It was one of you!
- Stop it! Shut up!

30:57.889 --> 30:59.481
Mulder,

30:59.557 --> 31:02.924
just put the gun down and
let Hodge give you a blood test.

31:02.994 --> 31:05.588
And doctor the results? He may be infected!

31:05.697 --> 31:07.756
He has to be confined - now!

31:07.866 --> 31:10.926
Then turn around and let us
take a look at your neck!

31:11.002 --> 31:15.302
I'm not turning my back on anyone!
As far as I'm concerned, you're all infected!

31:15.373 --> 31:17.273
Hodge is right! Lock him up!

31:18.109 --> 31:20.873
- Mulder!
- Scully, get that gun off me!

31:20.945 --> 31:23.505
- Mulder, you have to understand!
- Put it down!

31:23.581 --> 31:25.811
- You put it down first!
- Scully!

31:27.552 --> 31:29.747
For God's sakes, it's me!

31:31.823 --> 31:34.553
Mulder, you may not be who you are!

31:59.951 --> 32:02.249
In here, I'll be safer than you.

33:07.518 --> 33:09.418
What were you doing?

33:09.487 --> 33:11.580
You know what I was doing.

33:12.223 --> 33:14.817
You know, you're the only one with a gun.

33:14.892 --> 33:17.884
If you get infected, we don't stand a chance.

33:28.439 --> 33:29.872
OK.

33:40.685 --> 33:42.346
Was there something there?

33:42.453 --> 33:44.853
You're OK, Nancy.

33:44.922 --> 33:50.451
We're all OK. Now is not the time
for the three of us to turn on each other.

33:50.528 --> 33:52.291
There's four of us.

33:52.363 --> 33:56.732
- Mulder isn't one of us any more.
- If Mulder is infected, it's not his fault!

33:56.834 --> 34:00.133
We can't turn our backs on him now!
He needs us to help him!

34:00.271 --> 34:03.570
She's right.
Prolonged exposure to the parasite

34:03.674 --> 34:07.075
could damage him to the point
of permanent psychosis.

34:10.447 --> 34:12.916
But if he is infected, he doesn't go back.

34:12.984 --> 34:15.248
I won't risk the possibilities.

34:26.297 --> 34:29.164
This is AICP calling Doolittle Airfield.

34:29.300 --> 34:31.130
Please come in.

34:35.606 --> 34:40.009
This is the Arctic Ice Core Project
sending a general distress call.

34:40.110 --> 34:42.170
Please respond.

35:00.798 --> 35:05.599
Nancy, put a drop of uninfected blood
on the slide of the blood from the pilot.

35:05.703 --> 35:07.762
Run that by me again?

35:07.839 --> 35:10.967
Put the uninfected blood
on the infected blood.

35:20.318 --> 35:23.219
No, damn it! What did I just tell you?!

35:23.354 --> 35:26.846
You infected the infected blood!
Now I have to start again!

35:26.958 --> 35:30.394
- I made a mistake. Don't yell at me.
- Wasted hours of work!

35:30.461 --> 35:35.023
OK, then just do it by yourself, damn it!
God! I'm not your assistant!

35:43.574 --> 35:45.007
Hodge?

35:46.777 --> 35:48.438
What?

35:48.546 --> 35:50.605
Come take a look at this.

35:52.250 --> 35:56.050
The larvae from two different worms
killed each other.

36:15.306 --> 36:20.107
An individual worm will not tolerate
another invading its host.

36:20.211 --> 36:23.044
It does to the invader what it did to humans.

36:23.114 --> 36:25.309
It makes them kill.

36:25.416 --> 36:29.216
A species won't kill its own.
It needs another to procreate.

36:29.320 --> 36:32.721
Worms are hermaphroditic.
It can reproduce itself.

36:32.823 --> 36:35.383
Look at the evidence in the microscope.

36:36.494 --> 36:38.758
This thing does not like company.

36:38.829 --> 36:40.956
So what are you saying?

36:41.032 --> 36:46.060
The way to kill it is to introduce
another worm into an already infected body?

38:00.578 --> 38:02.671
Sounds OK.

38:14.759 --> 38:16.818
It passed the worms in its stool.

38:16.927 --> 38:18.986
They're dead.

38:22.967 --> 38:25.026
I want to talk to him first,

38:25.136 --> 38:27.127
try and make this voluntary.

38:27.204 --> 38:28.796
What?

38:28.906 --> 38:30.965
You can't go in alone.

38:31.042 --> 38:34.341
If anything happens, you come inside.

38:35.379 --> 38:38.507
I can't do this to him until I'm sure.

38:44.255 --> 38:45.244
Is itjust you?

38:45.356 --> 38:47.017
Yes.

38:54.198 --> 38:56.257
It's one of them.

38:56.367 --> 38:59.530
No one's been killed
since you've been in here.

39:00.404 --> 39:02.065
So?

39:04.342 --> 39:06.401
We found a way to kill it.

39:07.812 --> 39:10.576
Two worms... in one host

39:10.648 --> 39:12.741
will kill each other.

39:17.555 --> 39:20.615
You give me one worm, you'll infect me.

39:20.691 --> 39:22.784
If that's true,

39:22.860 --> 39:25.658
then why didn't you let us inspect you?

39:25.763 --> 39:29.028
I would have, but you pulled a gun on me!

39:29.100 --> 39:31.193
Now, I don't trust them!

39:33.170 --> 39:35.229
I want to trust you.

39:38.909 --> 39:40.809
OK.

39:42.780 --> 39:45.613
But now they're not here.

40:33.330 --> 40:35.423
This is the last one.

40:38.135 --> 40:40.467
She's not gonna let us give it to him.

40:40.571 --> 40:43.062
Well, she'll have to if he's infected.

40:43.140 --> 40:45.233
He'll convince her somehow.

40:53.150 --> 40:55.243
I just examined him.

40:55.319 --> 40:57.048
He's uninfected.

40:59.089 --> 41:01.148
So is she.

41:01.258 --> 41:03.920
Which means that it must be one of you.

41:05.663 --> 41:09.121
All right. Let's go over to the main building.

41:09.200 --> 41:11.361
I'd like to check him myself.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.869
Then he can examine both of us.

41:14.905 --> 41:16.736
Want to lead the way?

41:24.582 --> 41:25.913
No!

41:47.805 --> 41:49.329
Get the worm!

42:03.721 --> 42:05.211
Oh, my God.

42:09.260 --> 42:11.194
Mulder! It's her!

42:17.868 --> 42:19.927
Scully!

42:20.004 --> 42:22.063
It's Da Silva!

42:47.998 --> 42:49.295
Hodge! Now!

42:50.434 --> 42:55.167
Mulder! After this, there won't be any left!
They're all gonna be dead!

42:55.239 --> 42:56.900
Do it!

43:18.462 --> 43:20.987
It's all right. It's all over.

43:22.633 --> 43:25.193
It all stops right here,

43:25.269 --> 43:27.328
right now.

43:28.472 --> 43:30.531
OK, I got it.

43:30.641 --> 43:33.405
At the intersection of Yukon and 17th.

43:33.477 --> 43:35.945
State patrol is on the scene. Code 3. Over.

43:43.954 --> 43:47.014
She'll be put in quarantine
along with the dog.

43:47.091 --> 43:51.619
We'll keep her there until we're sure
she won't infect the population.

43:51.729 --> 43:55.893
Meanwhile, our tests came back normal,
so we've been released.

43:55.966 --> 43:59.925
Plane ready. It'll take you
as far from the ice as you wanna go.

44:00.638 --> 44:06.042
I'm goin' back to the site. This time I'm going
fully prepared with proper equipment.

44:06.110 --> 44:09.876
There's still research to be done
on the genetic structure...

44:09.947 --> 44:12.882
Wait, Mulder. Don't you know?

44:12.950 --> 44:14.178
Know what?

44:15.552 --> 44:18.316
45 minutes after evacuating us,
they torched the place.

44:18.389 --> 44:20.152
There's nothing left.

44:20.257 --> 44:21.952
Who did that?

44:22.059 --> 44:25.460
The military? Centers for Disease Control?

44:25.529 --> 44:28.657
You ought to know. They're your people.

44:34.571 --> 44:36.664
It's still there, Scully.

44:38.275 --> 44:40.334
200,000 years down,

44:41.412 --> 44:43.505
in the ice.

44:45.015 --> 44:47.108
Leave it there.
