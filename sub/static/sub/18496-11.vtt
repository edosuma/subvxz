00:17.401 --> 00:19.778
El Gato!

00:36.551 --> 00:40.131
<b>4x11 - Little Lamb</b>

00:47.264 --> 00:50.350
Yay!

00:53.604 --> 00:54.771
Just think...

00:55.147 --> 00:59.026
our quest to protect San Lorenzo
will finally be over.

00:59.109 --> 01:01.862
What a long road it has been.

01:01.945 --> 01:04.114
What with all of the crowns and the gems

01:04.197 --> 01:06.951
and the authors
and the witches and pirates.

01:07.034 --> 01:08.911
Oh! I forgot about the pirates.

01:08.994 --> 01:12.831
I forgot about all that stuff.
Also, quick question...

01:12.915 --> 01:15.626
- Your name is Artephius.
- Thank you kindly.

01:15.709 --> 01:18.921
Now. We must get to this
Grotto of Riches at once. We go.

01:19.004 --> 01:20.005
Woo-hoo-hoo!

01:24.593 --> 01:26.386
Okay, I'm outta here.

01:26.470 --> 01:28.096
I'm gonna brunch with Callista.

01:28.180 --> 01:29.264
Um...

01:30.015 --> 01:32.184
What? Isn't that, like,
a thing that sisters do

01:32.267 --> 01:33.894
when they don't hate each other?

01:34.144 --> 01:35.270
Ciao!

01:35.646 --> 01:37.273
Bye, Sphinx! We'll see you back...

01:37.356 --> 01:39.650
No, no. This pleasantry
we do not have time for.

01:39.733 --> 01:41.026
Not a moment to waste.

01:41.109 --> 01:42.778
Into the grotto we go.

01:42.861 --> 01:44.404
The obelisk awaits.

01:52.663 --> 01:53.789
Ooh!

01:53.872 --> 01:56.416
So this is
the Grotto of Riches.

01:56.500 --> 01:57.918
Ooh-la-la.

01:58.001 --> 01:59.336
- Wow!
- Ooh!

02:01.129 --> 02:03.924
Hmm. It certainly lives up to its name.

02:04.007 --> 02:07.719
Why, if I were still
in my treasure-seeking days, oh, boy.

02:15.936 --> 02:16.853
Hmm.

02:34.413 --> 02:35.539
Whoa!

02:42.212 --> 02:44.673
Intruders!

02:44.965 --> 02:49.678
How did you gain entry
to my Grotto of Riches?

02:50.637 --> 02:52.556
Through the door?

02:59.438 --> 03:02.941
Oh! Never end a statement
with an upward inflection.

03:04.151 --> 03:05.360
It's inelegant.

03:06.820 --> 03:07.696
For example...

03:08.196 --> 03:09.781
you all need to leave?

03:09.865 --> 03:11.742
Or I'm gonna kill you?

03:11.825 --> 03:15.245
Hold your tongue, sheep.
We have come for the Obelisk of Night.

03:15.329 --> 03:17.622
And we demand you give it to us now.

03:19.291 --> 03:22.711
Ho-ho! But you haven't even seen
the rest of my collection yet.

03:22.794 --> 03:26.715
I've traveled the world
accumulating a trove of curiosities.

03:26.798 --> 03:27.966
Such as...

03:29.134 --> 03:30.886
The Lamp of Fire.

03:31.386 --> 03:33.597
It is very lovely,
but we have no time for...

03:33.680 --> 03:34.848
Whoa!

03:37.142 --> 03:39.353
Then there's this little bauble...

03:39.936 --> 03:42.606
the Enchanted Glove of Sagunto.

03:46.568 --> 03:48.236
I have no time...

03:49.529 --> 03:55.285
And my favorite of all,
the Unseeable Box of Dr. Alazarius.

04:02.292 --> 04:03.710
An invisible cage.

04:03.794 --> 04:07.089
What is it with us and cages?
It's becoming our thing.

04:07.172 --> 04:09.424
Sheep! Let us out at once!

04:10.008 --> 04:13.428
Uh, sorry. I can't hear you from over here
in the Scepter Wing.

04:13.512 --> 04:15.472
I have over 40 scepters.

04:15.555 --> 04:18.016
No big deal.

04:18.684 --> 04:22.979
It actually is a big deal.
 I'm so rich.

04:23.063 --> 04:27.484
Wow, seems like you must have everything
you desire, Mr...

04:27.567 --> 04:31.780
Angus. And, uh, yes,
I do have nearly everything.

04:31.863 --> 04:33.490
Including that obelisk.

04:33.573 --> 04:36.451
Hmm. But there must be something
you don't have.

04:36.535 --> 04:39.955
What if we find it for you?
Would you trade us the Obelisk?

04:41.164 --> 04:44.376
Oh, you couldn't possibly find
that for which I pine,

04:44.459 --> 04:46.837
because it's not a that. It's a her.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.213
Whoop.

04:51.967 --> 04:53.051
Mary.

04:55.220 --> 04:58.640
Mary? As in...? No. Really?

04:59.349 --> 05:00.350
Mm-hmm.

05:00.809 --> 05:02.769
"Mary Had a Little Lamb"?

05:03.353 --> 05:05.355
Yes. Yes, indeed.

05:06.356 --> 05:08.859
I was that little lamb, you see.

05:08.984 --> 05:12.154
My fleece was white as snow,

05:12.237 --> 05:16.783
and everywhere that Mary went,
there I was sure to go.

05:16.867 --> 05:19.369
I followed her to school one day,

05:19.453 --> 05:21.037
which was against the rule.

05:21.121 --> 05:23.874
It made the children laugh and play

05:23.957 --> 05:25.751
to see a lamb at school.

05:35.093 --> 05:37.429
Oh, we were poor, you see,

05:37.512 --> 05:40.223
but I had gotten her
admitted to a wealthy school.

05:40.515 --> 05:43.852
Mary was so embarrassed
by the laughter of those rich children

05:43.935 --> 05:45.729
that she abandoned me.

05:45.812 --> 05:47.981
So I set out to show them all

05:48.064 --> 05:51.318
by becoming the richest sheep
who ever lived...

05:52.235 --> 05:55.822
despite my lack of formal education.

05:55.906 --> 05:59.868
For years, I've tried unsuccessfully
to track Mary down.

06:00.327 --> 06:02.579
Oh, to tell her that you've missed her?

06:02.913 --> 06:05.665
No. To gloat about my riches.

06:05.749 --> 06:07.751
And to make her feel terrible.

06:08.084 --> 06:11.213
And extract an apology from her smug face.

06:11.296 --> 06:13.340
Hm. That doesn't seem like
a very nice thing to...

06:13.423 --> 06:14.591
Yes. Fine, anything.

06:14.674 --> 06:18.595
We will bring this Mary to you,
and you will give us the Obelisk of Night.

06:18.678 --> 06:19.554
Agreed?

06:23.391 --> 06:24.392
Agreed.

06:29.356 --> 06:30.732
We are nearly there.

06:31.650 --> 06:33.860
What did people do before dowsing rods?

06:33.944 --> 06:38.031
We tickled an enchanted frog.
Ugh! It was gross.

06:42.619 --> 06:45.789
More sheep?
How many little lambs did Mary have?

06:45.872 --> 06:47.499
I thought just the one.

06:48.083 --> 06:49.334
Unless there are more verses.

06:49.417 --> 06:51.962
There's always another verse
no one's ever heard of.

06:52.462 --> 06:54.297
And that must be her.

06:55.382 --> 06:57.717
Now, let us go to Mary and take her away.

07:00.887 --> 07:02.764
We loves Miss Mary.

07:02.847 --> 07:05.767
We never let her leave,
sorry, please, thank you.

07:05.850 --> 07:08.853
She is our leader. And our teacher.

07:08.937 --> 07:11.565
She teachered us everything we know.

07:12.274 --> 07:15.193
Um, and she's done a terrific job.

07:15.277 --> 07:17.362
But we really need to talk to her.

07:17.445 --> 07:20.991
Nobody talk to Miss Mary.
Sorry, please, thank you.

07:29.374 --> 07:32.419
Is it me, or do these rams
seem a little dim?

07:32.544 --> 07:35.255
It is not you. They are definitely dim.

07:36.047 --> 07:37.632
They seem sharp to me.

07:42.554 --> 07:44.556
Right. So we are agreed.

07:44.639 --> 07:46.892
We will trick these rams
by pretending to be sheep.

07:46.975 --> 07:48.018
Once they have accepted us,

07:48.101 --> 07:50.103
we will break down their social order
from within

07:50.186 --> 07:52.647
and convince them
to let Mary leave. We go!

07:53.064 --> 07:55.317
Wait! We do not go.

07:55.400 --> 07:58.528
Puss, your plan is absurd.
Why don't we just talk to Mary?

07:58.612 --> 07:59.821
That will take too long.

07:59.905 --> 08:01.990
Infiltrating and restructuring
a complex society

08:02.073 --> 08:03.533
will be much faster than talking.

08:03.617 --> 08:05.285
Now, let us do this thing.

08:06.745 --> 08:07.579
No.

08:08.079 --> 08:10.790
Are you... Are you putting your foot down?

08:13.418 --> 08:16.504
We should obviously just ask Mary
to come with us.

08:16.588 --> 08:18.715
Isn't that a more reasonable plan?

08:18.798 --> 08:20.884
No. I have already made up my mind,

08:20.967 --> 08:23.261
and it would take too much time
to un-make it.

08:23.345 --> 08:24.554
We will pretend to be rams.

08:24.638 --> 08:27.015
- Who's with me?
- I'm with you, Puss.

08:27.098 --> 08:28.642
And I'm with you, Puss.

08:29.351 --> 08:30.977
Oh. It is on.

08:31.061 --> 08:33.313
First one to get Mary to leave this place
is the winner.

08:33.395 --> 08:34.481
That is all that matters.

08:34.563 --> 08:37.817
No, saving San Lorenzo
is all that matters.

08:37.900 --> 08:40.236
Which I am going to do. Not you.

08:40.403 --> 08:43.365
The Great Mary Race is on. Huzzah!

08:57.128 --> 09:01.716
Toby, acting is all about convincing
others what you yourself believe.

09:01.800 --> 09:05.303
To act as a ram,
you must believe you are a ram.

09:09.599 --> 09:12.185
Okay, I am a ram.

09:13.770 --> 09:16.690
Oh, my gosh!
All these years I thought I was a pig.

09:16.773 --> 09:18.984
I've wasted my life.

09:21.152 --> 09:23.405
Hello, fellow ram.

09:24.155 --> 09:25.657
I see lovely green grass.

09:25.740 --> 09:29.619
I shall eat some, for as a ram,
grass is my favorite.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.915
Mmm. Quite fresh today, yes?

09:45.969 --> 09:46.886
Hmm.

09:47.512 --> 09:51.349
Oh. Hey, there, Toby-ram.
How about you come over here?

09:51.850 --> 09:53.435
- Okay.
- Uh-uh-uh.

09:53.518 --> 09:55.770
On all fours, as rams do.

09:57.397 --> 09:59.441
And we have a nice friendly head-butt.

09:59.524 --> 10:01.860
That sounds enjoyable, no?

10:02.736 --> 10:03.903
- Huh? Huh?
- Yeah? Yeah?

10:09.242 --> 10:10.410
Baaa!

10:16.916 --> 10:18.168
Toby-ram. Next time...

10:21.504 --> 10:23.256
This may be harder than I thought.

10:23.339 --> 10:26.092
Also, I think my brain is swelling.

10:44.611 --> 10:47.739
Quietly, Artephius.
No sudden movements.

11:08.176 --> 11:11.137
What you gonna do
with that rock in your hat, Puss?

11:12.722 --> 11:16.643
I will become their leader
by asserting my dominance.

11:24.192 --> 11:25.860
Eh! No, no, no, no, no!

11:29.781 --> 11:30.698
An owl.

11:31.199 --> 11:33.284
Now watch. Hm?

11:39.916 --> 11:41.084
Ha-ha!

11:45.547 --> 11:46.506
Voila!

11:58.685 --> 12:03.731
Oh. Excuse me. Oh, pardon me.
Coming through.

12:07.819 --> 12:08.820
Oh!

12:08.903 --> 12:10.154
Good rams.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.492
There. That wasn't so bad.

12:19.664 --> 12:21.165
Oh!

12:22.292 --> 12:24.168
"When a stranger you should meet..."

12:30.174 --> 12:31.718
Up-up-up, Clarence.

12:31.801 --> 12:34.637
We don't head-butt people,
because head-butting is...

12:35.221 --> 12:37.599
Rude, Miss Mary.

12:37.682 --> 12:40.226
And when we act rudely, our...

12:40.310 --> 12:42.896
Legs fall off.

12:43.479 --> 12:44.314
What?

12:44.397 --> 12:46.566
So, what do we say to the nice lady?

12:46.649 --> 12:49.027
Sorry, please, thank you.

12:49.903 --> 12:51.696
Hello, I'm Mary. What's your name?

12:51.779 --> 12:54.073
I'm Dulcinea. Pleased to meet you.

12:54.657 --> 12:59.287
Welcome to Miss Mary's Academy
for the Higher Education of Wayward Sheep.

12:59.370 --> 13:03.207
Also known as M-M-A-H-E-

13:03.291 --> 13:06.377
I... E... I-O?

13:06.502 --> 13:09.130
Yes, that's it. Uh, won't you join us?

13:09.881 --> 13:14.677
We're about to learn
that the capital of London is Atlantis.

13:18.848 --> 13:20.892
We must take our game
to the next level, Toby.

13:20.975 --> 13:23.102
Let us speak to them
in their own language.

13:23.353 --> 13:24.312
Baaa!

13:32.111 --> 13:37.408
You has two owls in your hat
but only the blue one can write music?

13:38.159 --> 13:41.621
You make no sense,
sorry, please, thank you.

13:44.749 --> 13:47.126
This is useless. We need a new plan.

13:47.210 --> 13:48.920
Baaa!

13:51.089 --> 13:53.258
Ba-bababa-ba!

13:53.424 --> 13:56.010
Baaa! Baa!

13:56.094 --> 13:59.097
You two is rams,
and you camed here to tell us

13:59.180 --> 14:01.641
that Miss Mary is terrible leader,

14:01.724 --> 14:05.478
and orange ram with shoe-boots
be our leader now?

14:07.063 --> 14:08.272
Okay, sure.

14:10.358 --> 14:14.153
You see, our town is in grave danger,
and we need this obelisk.

14:14.237 --> 14:15.238
Voila!

14:17.490 --> 14:21.160
I wish I could help,
but I can't possibly leave my pupils.

14:21.244 --> 14:23.329
I'm doing very important work here.

14:25.123 --> 14:26.624
Head-butting is bad, dear.

14:29.711 --> 14:32.380
Miss Mary, what be's eight plus three?

14:32.463 --> 14:33.673
Eighty-three.

14:33.881 --> 14:35.008
Oh, oopsie.

14:35.091 --> 14:37.427
No. It's actually 11.

14:38.094 --> 14:41.431
Oh, I'm sorry. It's just,
I'm a teacher, too, back in San Lorenzo.

14:41.514 --> 14:43.433
Then you must know how annoying it is

14:43.516 --> 14:45.935
when someone corrects you
in front of your students.

14:46.019 --> 14:47.603
Especially when they're wrong.

14:47.687 --> 14:50.481
Miss Mary, Ezekial bited me.

14:50.565 --> 14:53.526
Then you may bite him back,
but only lightly.

14:53.609 --> 14:56.279
Remember, when a friend gives you a bite,

14:56.362 --> 15:00.575
nibble back, but only light,
else you'll surely lose your sight.

15:00.867 --> 15:03.703
What? But biting someone is always wrong.

15:03.786 --> 15:04.787
Like the book says...

15:04.871 --> 15:08.499
It's cute that you need a little book
to tell you what's right.

15:08.583 --> 15:11.377
I guess not everyone can just know
in their heart.

15:11.961 --> 15:14.630
Was that an insult?
I think that was an insult!

15:14.714 --> 15:18.426
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to prepare this afternoon's lesson

15:18.509 --> 15:23.014
on things that are flat,
like tortillas and the Earth.

15:23.097 --> 15:26.017
Ugh! You are a horrible teacher.

15:26.100 --> 15:27.852
You're not doing important work.

15:27.935 --> 15:30.771
In fact, it would probably
be better for these so-called

15:30.772 --> 15:33.608
"pupils" of yours if you'd
leave them and come help us

15:33.691 --> 15:35.818
- get the obelisk from Angus.
- Blah, blah, blah.

15:38.279 --> 15:39.405
Angus?

15:44.369 --> 15:47.413
Angus! I haven't heard that name in years.

15:48.623 --> 15:51.000
Angus was my lamb, you see.

15:51.084 --> 15:54.379
I couldn't take him to school,
and it devastated him.

15:54.837 --> 15:56.881
That's why I foundered this academy.

15:56.964 --> 15:57.799
"Founded."

15:58.091 --> 16:00.843
And you're right. I'm not a good teacher.

16:03.137 --> 16:05.348
Angus was the real brains
between us.

16:05.431 --> 16:07.058
He was the one who wrote my entrance essay

16:07.141 --> 16:09.936
to that snooty, no-sheep-allowed school
in the first place.

16:13.648 --> 16:15.566
I was always a lousy student.

16:22.407 --> 16:24.492
Angus was the one who sent us.

16:24.575 --> 16:28.287
Oh, come with us.
You can finally be reunited with him.

16:28.371 --> 16:30.123
Oh, of course I'll go.

16:30.206 --> 16:32.959
In fact, maybe Angus is the very person

16:33.042 --> 16:35.753
to help me become a better teacher
for my beloved rams.

16:36.254 --> 16:40.049
He's so smart.
He can spell the whole alphabet.

16:41.467 --> 16:43.886
Hooray! My plan worked, I won!

16:44.554 --> 16:47.932
I mean, yay for saving San Lorenzo!

17:01.237 --> 17:03.906
She has betrayed you, my subjects.

17:03.990 --> 17:05.992
Cast her out!

17:09.412 --> 17:10.329
Baaa!

17:11.329 --> 17:12.290
Oh, boy.

17:20.839 --> 17:22.175
Oh, my.

17:22.717 --> 17:26.804
Ha-ha. Dulcinea.
Do you see? I won.

17:27.305 --> 17:31.017
Um, A, no you didn't.
And B, Puss, what have you done?

17:32.018 --> 17:34.520
I have become the rams' new leader.

17:34.604 --> 17:37.982
Mary will be cast out in disgrace,
and we can take her with us.

17:38.065 --> 17:40.818
But I've already gotten her
to agree to leave.

17:41.110 --> 17:43.112
That does not mean that I did not win,
does it?

17:43.196 --> 17:45.323
Puss, call off your rams now!

17:46.574 --> 17:49.327
Very well.
But technically, this means I win.

17:49.410 --> 17:50.411
Does not!

17:50.495 --> 17:52.330
Would you settle for a tie?

17:52.413 --> 17:53.498
Go!

17:56.000 --> 17:57.043
Rams!

18:02.423 --> 18:04.634
We have accomplished
what we set out to do.

18:04.717 --> 18:07.678
And we will be leaving you now.
It has been a pleasure.

18:11.766 --> 18:13.392
Did you not hear me? We must go now!

18:13.476 --> 18:15.102
I will write. Infrequently.

18:17.188 --> 18:18.189
Okay.

18:24.570 --> 18:25.696
Ahh!

18:26.405 --> 18:29.242
We love orange ram with shoe-boots.

18:29.325 --> 18:32.328
We never let him leave,
sorry, please, thank you.

18:32.411 --> 18:34.080
He is our leader.

18:34.247 --> 18:36.332
Step aside so that I may pass.

18:38.459 --> 18:41.546
Oh! This is no way to treat
your very handsome master.

18:42.088 --> 18:45.132
Ooh! Hey! Be careful!

18:45.216 --> 18:48.719
Oh!
Excuse me. New lesson, rams.

18:50.972 --> 18:52.640
Head-butting is good!

18:53.140 --> 18:54.183
What?

18:59.772 --> 19:01.774
Baaa! Baaa!

19:05.278 --> 19:06.237
Run!

19:06.821 --> 19:08.906
These rams are like sponges.

19:09.365 --> 19:11.325
You can literally teach them anything.

19:11.867 --> 19:13.077
Yay!

19:14.161 --> 19:15.705
And boom! You're done!

19:16.497 --> 19:19.458
And now you know everything
I know about alchemy.

19:19.542 --> 19:20.751
Woo-hoo-hoo!

19:24.338 --> 19:27.049
And this is my largest emerald.

19:27.133 --> 19:28.634
Over 100 carats.

19:29.010 --> 19:31.762
All my other emeralds are jealous of it.

19:34.098 --> 19:36.892
And this chalice is made of pure platinum.

19:36.976 --> 19:40.062
I tend to be more of a gold man,
but you know what they say,

19:40.146 --> 19:42.064
"All that glitters is not gold."

19:42.148 --> 19:44.233
Right. There's also glitter.

19:46.152 --> 19:47.737
Yeah, sure. So.

19:47.820 --> 19:50.823
Do you see how wealthy I've become?
Do you see?

19:50.906 --> 19:54.869
Oh, yes, Angus. It's so impressive.

19:55.620 --> 19:58.497
I bet it makes you feel
like living garbage

19:58.581 --> 20:02.376
to see how I've thrived here alone
amongst my riches.

20:02.793 --> 20:06.297
You must be chilled to the bone
to see how little I need you

20:06.380 --> 20:07.757
or your friendship.

20:09.050 --> 20:10.176
Oh...

20:10.259 --> 20:13.512
So, tell me, what have you been
up to all these years?

20:13.596 --> 20:16.432
Eating trash and picking fleas?

20:18.142 --> 20:22.438
Uh, after what happened at the school,
I just felt so guilty.

20:23.147 --> 20:26.025
So, I opened a school
for underprivileged sheep.

20:26.817 --> 20:27.652
Huh?

20:28.611 --> 20:32.990
I dedicated my life to improving
the lives of sheep and rams.

20:33.824 --> 20:35.493
And other types of reptiles.

20:40.081 --> 20:42.708
You've spent your life doing good.

20:42.875 --> 20:47.129
And all I've done is accumulate
hollow treasure out of spite.

20:47.922 --> 20:49.715
Now who's living garbage?

20:51.801 --> 20:54.845
- I am. I am!
- Oh!

20:57.640 --> 20:58.683
There, there.

20:59.225 --> 21:01.102
Sure, it's been rewarding.

21:01.185 --> 21:05.231
But it's a lot of work
for just one person.

21:07.358 --> 21:08.526
You mean...?

21:08.609 --> 21:11.779
Maybe you could come help me teach?

21:12.238 --> 21:13.989
I'm really not that good at it.

21:16.033 --> 21:18.452
Mary, I would love to.

21:18.619 --> 21:21.247
And I could donate all my riches
to your school.

21:24.875 --> 21:27.378
How about to our school?

21:30.715 --> 21:35.177
Once again, against all odds,
Puss in Boots saved the day.

21:35.678 --> 21:40.516
Uh, at the same time
that Dulcinea did as well.

21:40.766 --> 21:42.351
Thanks. Sort of.

21:42.935 --> 21:45.813
Now if you don't mind,
we need that obelisk.

21:45.896 --> 21:49.400
Oh. Yes, about that.

22:02.413 --> 22:03.789
Here ya go.

22:08.252 --> 22:11.005
Why, it is just a souvenir obelisk!

22:11.088 --> 22:13.591
A tchotchke. A novelty knickknack.

22:13.674 --> 22:16.468
Didn't I mention that? Huh, weird.

22:16.552 --> 22:19.847
But, I know where the real obelisk is.

22:19.930 --> 22:22.141
It's in a little town called...

22:22.892 --> 22:24.226
San Lorenzo.

22:33.319 --> 22:35.863
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

22:35.946 --> 22:37.490
I think I broke something.
