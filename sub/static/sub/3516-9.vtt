WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.754
When the enemy attacked,
you ran away.
That's treason.

00:03.920 --> 00:06.674
Now it's time
to splatter your
brains everywhere.

00:06.760 --> 00:09.116
Please! Please,
don't kill me!

00:09.240 --> 00:10.993
Shut up!
Die like a man!

00:11.080 --> 00:12.673
But I have
a wife and family.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.154
That's what
happens to cowards.

00:16.239 --> 00:18.357
Hey.
You have to keep it down.

00:18.440 --> 00:19.840
There's an important
meeting going on.

00:20.400 --> 00:21.390
Sorry.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.119
I'll set you up
in the copy room.

00:23.200 --> 00:25.237
You won't be
in the way there.

00:25.320 --> 00:27.630
This is gonna be a close vote.
Most of your colleagues

00:27.720 --> 00:30.554
are not gonna want to spend
this amount of money
in just 25 districts.

00:30.800 --> 00:32.359
Try persuasion first.

00:32.439 --> 00:33.715
Talking points
are in your packets.

00:33.800 --> 00:37.237
And if you want more
detailed information,
research, statistics,

00:37.320 --> 00:39.118
you can contact
Gillian or myself.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.197
And when it comes
to doling out favors,
talk to Doug.

00:41.280 --> 00:44.193
If favors don't work,
come to me directly. Peter.

00:44.280 --> 00:45.634
I'll be campaigning
in Pennsylvania.

00:45.720 --> 00:48.872
All my events this
week will be in counties
within the watershed,

00:48.960 --> 00:50.155
so I'll be working
the media angle.

00:50.240 --> 00:52.311
But if you need me
to get on the phone
with anybody,

00:52.400 --> 00:54.073
reach out to Christina.
She'll work it
into my schedule.

00:54.160 --> 00:57.676
I have to say, Frank,
$200 million is
going to be a hard sell.

00:57.760 --> 01:00.229
The natural gas lobby's
already putting
up a big fight.

01:00.320 --> 01:01.720
We need to make
this about jobs.

01:01.800 --> 01:04.394
But the drilling industry
can offer far more jobs
than this bill can.

01:04.480 --> 01:05.800
This bill doesn't
threaten those jobs,

01:05.960 --> 01:07.713
it just makes
sure the drilling
is done responsibly.

01:07.800 --> 01:09.393
It adds more jobs
on top of that.

01:09.480 --> 01:11.597
I've already been
approached by SanCorp
with re-election funds.

01:11.680 --> 01:14.320
I have too.
They offered me
a donation package

01:14.480 --> 01:16.073
from eight different
drilling companies.

01:16.160 --> 01:17.879
Remy Danton?
Yep.

01:18.160 --> 01:19.879
How many of you been
approached by Remy?

01:21.840 --> 01:24.400
Look, I know it's not easy
to turn down money.

01:24.520 --> 01:27.831
But if the Republicans
control redistricting
in Pennsylvania,

01:27.920 --> 01:29.673
we lose the House
next election,

01:29.760 --> 01:32.434
and all of you lose your
committee chairmanships.

01:32.520 --> 01:34.352
This is a feather that
we need in Peter's hat.

01:34.800 --> 01:37.599
A loss on this bill
endangers his
chance of winning,

01:37.680 --> 01:40.434
and we are fighting to
keep our majority here.

01:40.520 --> 01:41.840
Any other concerns?

01:42.720 --> 01:45.030
I want a first vote count
by 4:00 tomorrow afternoon.

01:45.120 --> 01:47.032
Thank you all very much.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:22.600 --> 03:25.240
It's brutal.
Twenty-two stops
in three days.

03:25.320 --> 03:27.880
It's a lot of
sleeping on the bus.
No sleeping.

03:27.960 --> 03:29.758
That bus is the only place
I can get work done.

03:29.840 --> 03:32.833
You know, Francis did
a big bus tour in 1998,

03:32.920 --> 03:36.152
and the bus lost its
brakes going down a hill

03:36.240 --> 03:37.674
and we landed in
a tobacco field.

03:37.760 --> 03:41.231
He gets out of the car,
knocks on the farmer's door,

03:41.360 --> 03:43.158
writes a check for
all the damaged crops,

03:43.280 --> 03:46.557
and then borrows his pickup
so he doesn't
miss the next event.

03:46.680 --> 03:48.160
And it was actually fun.

03:48.240 --> 03:51.517
He was driving. I was shotgun,
and they had the whole
staff in the flatbed.

03:51.640 --> 03:53.040
We actually got
there 10 minutes early.

03:53.120 --> 03:55.396
I think I should
be here to help
drum up votes.

03:55.480 --> 03:56.960
Careful, sir.
It's very hot.

03:57.040 --> 03:58.110
Look, you and
the Vice President

03:58.240 --> 03:59.276
are gonna get
national coverage.

03:59.360 --> 04:00.919
That's gonna help us
with the count.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.753
I reached out to him.
He never got back to me.

04:02.840 --> 04:04.957
I don't know if he
even knows the talking
points about the bill.

04:05.040 --> 04:06.360
I don't think
Jim wants to go.

04:06.440 --> 04:08.113
He's doing it as a favor
to the President and I,

04:08.240 --> 04:10.197
so it doesn't matter
if he doesn't know
the talking points.

04:10.280 --> 04:12.397
People wanna see him
be folksy, you know?

04:12.520 --> 04:14.910
So just humor him.
Show him some degree of...

04:15.200 --> 04:16.519
Oh, my God.

04:16.680 --> 04:18.079
Are you okay?
It was an accident.

04:18.160 --> 04:20.277
Okay, it's time
for us to go.
I'm so sorry.

04:20.360 --> 04:23.194
It's all right.
I just need to run it
under some cold water.

04:25.880 --> 04:28.998
I'm not going to lie.
I despise children.

04:30.040 --> 04:31.554
There. I've said it.

04:31.640 --> 04:33.632
You can't act
like that in here.

04:33.720 --> 04:35.393
You have to be
a big boy.
I know.

04:35.480 --> 04:37.949
Peter, we really
need to get going.

04:38.040 --> 04:40.271
We've already missed
one flight because
the meeting went over.

04:40.360 --> 04:42.033
I booked us another
one at 9:25, but...

04:42.160 --> 04:43.594
We have to drop
the kids off at school.

04:43.720 --> 04:44.870
It's going to be
really tight.

04:44.960 --> 04:46.792
If we miss this plane,
we have to cancel
our first event.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.073
Nancy,
can you take them?

04:49.160 --> 04:51.959
I've gotta get packets ready
for the lunchtime subcaucuses.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.790
Peter, I'd do it,
but we have a meeting with
Greenpeace in 20 minutes.

04:54.880 --> 04:56.234
I gotta get their
rating on the bill.

04:56.400 --> 04:57.675
Where's their school?

04:58.120 --> 04:59.110
Connecticut and Q.

04:59.200 --> 05:01.112
Oh, I can take them.
You sure?

05:01.600 --> 05:03.353
Yes. It's on the way
to my office.

05:03.440 --> 05:05.796
This Watershed Act
proves that once again

05:05.880 --> 05:10.159
the anti-capitalist
agenda is alive and well
in the Democratic party.

05:10.240 --> 05:12.391
Let me show you
what's really going on.

05:12.760 --> 05:16.310
Here are the Democrats
eating up all of
their soft science,

05:16.400 --> 05:18.631
"organically
homegrown" propaganda

05:18.720 --> 05:21.315
that the eco-fanatics
are force-feeding them.

05:21.400 --> 05:24.359
And over here,
at the tail-end of
all those jackasses,

05:24.480 --> 05:26.312
are middle-class Americans.

05:26.400 --> 05:29.074
People who just
want to work hard

05:29.160 --> 05:32.073
and rely on jobs in
the drilling industry.

05:33.920 --> 05:35.991
And what about
the hypocrisy, folks?

05:36.080 --> 05:38.117
Does Peter Russo
honestly have the gall

05:38.240 --> 05:40.277
to lecture us on
the purity of our rivers,

05:40.400 --> 05:44.155
when he has been
polluting himself
with chemicals for years?

05:44.680 --> 05:47.957
He's not just
been eating grass,
he's been smoking it.

05:48.040 --> 05:50.509
It's the only major bill
he's sponsored in six years.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.160
I know, but they
already have national
coverage. What's the angle?

05:53.240 --> 05:54.276
If it doesn't pass,

05:54.400 --> 05:56.676
I think he'll lose support
from the Shipbuilders'
Association.

05:56.760 --> 05:58.831
So they lose support.
It's not that juicy.

05:58.960 --> 06:01.429
They're a huge part of
his get-out-the-vote
effort in Philly.

06:01.560 --> 06:03.199
It sounds like
inside baseball.

06:03.280 --> 06:04.509
Not if I get
the vote count.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.478
Black and white numbers.
Nobody has that.

06:06.560 --> 06:09.917
But when I
called the campaign,
they stone-walled me.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.400
Same thing at
the Whip's office.

06:11.880 --> 06:14.270
Do you know
anyone over there?
In Underwood's office?

06:14.400 --> 06:15.800
No, I don't.

06:15.880 --> 06:17.234
Nobody on staff?

06:17.320 --> 06:18.595
Mm-mmm.
Oh.

06:18.840 --> 06:21.480
I just figured
because you gave me
the Russo profile.

06:21.560 --> 06:22.755
No, that didn't
come from them.

06:22.840 --> 06:25.036
But Underwood
organized the campaign.

06:25.120 --> 06:27.794
I'm sorry.
I don't know
anybody there.

06:28.960 --> 06:30.633
Okay.

06:35.720 --> 06:37.791
Hey, it's me.
I just wanted to fill
you in on something.

06:37.880 --> 06:40.918
I should be
back home at 10:00.
Meet me there.

06:44.480 --> 06:46.073
- Sarah made
this one.
- It's a frog.

06:46.160 --> 06:48.152
And I made this one.
Can you guess what it is?

06:48.240 --> 06:49.390
A lobster?

06:49.480 --> 06:53.190
No. It's a scorpion.
They're for you.
For the ones you gave us.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.272
Oh, they're beautiful.

06:56.680 --> 06:59.559
But maybe you should
bring them to school, no?

06:59.640 --> 07:02.394
For show-and-tell?
Or give them
to your friends.

07:02.480 --> 07:04.199
No. The other kids
will just make fun of us.

07:05.560 --> 07:06.994
Why?

07:07.080 --> 07:09.470
Everybody hates us
at school.

07:10.040 --> 07:12.600
They say Dad's a crackhead
and that we're crack babies.

07:12.680 --> 07:16.151
I looked up "crack baby"
on the computer.
I don't look like that.

07:16.240 --> 07:19.312
You know,
they say Dad's gonna OD
like Amy Winehouse.

07:21.680 --> 07:23.160
Well, you tell them
that your dad

07:23.240 --> 07:25.596
doesn't do that kind
of thing anymore, right?

07:25.680 --> 07:28.479
Yeah, we do,
but they don't believe us.

07:30.760 --> 07:32.831
Did you try going
to the teachers?

07:32.920 --> 07:35.719
We can't do that.
Everyone would just
hate us even more.

07:40.720 --> 07:43.872
Well, you can't worry
about what other
people think, right?

07:44.400 --> 07:46.710
I wish Dad wasn't
running for governor.

07:48.720 --> 07:50.518
You ever been to
Allentown before?
I have not.

07:50.600 --> 07:51.920
What do you think?

07:52.040 --> 07:54.680
Compared to New York,
the parking is easier.

07:54.760 --> 07:56.956
Finding a decent bagel,
not so much.

07:57.080 --> 07:58.594
We'd make up for it
with the cream cheese.

07:58.720 --> 08:00.313
Shall we?
Ready when you are.

08:00.400 --> 08:01.436
Your Watershed Bill.

08:01.520 --> 08:04.115
You've ticked off
the Republicans,
oil, gas...

08:04.200 --> 08:05.998
Sometimes you gotta
upset a few people
to do the right thing.

08:06.080 --> 08:08.470
Not just a few.
There's a sizable coalition

08:08.560 --> 08:10.279
that wants to
see your bill fail,

08:10.360 --> 08:12.431
including environmentalists
from your own party

08:12.520 --> 08:13.510
who don't think
the bill does enough.

08:13.600 --> 08:14.590
We wanted
a passable bill.

08:14.720 --> 08:16.074
That's why we aimed
for a middle ground...

08:16.200 --> 08:19.159
Do you actually care
about the Delaware River?

08:19.240 --> 08:20.913
I don't sponsor legislation
I don't care about.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.595
Until recently,
you hadn't sponsored
any legislation at all.

08:23.680 --> 08:24.955
I spent my time
in Congress

08:25.040 --> 08:26.713
focusing on things
that were important
to my constituents.

08:27.440 --> 08:28.430
The shipyard.

08:29.600 --> 08:30.875
Kept it open
as long as I could.

08:30.960 --> 08:33.475
Okay. That's one thing.
What are the others?

08:33.559 --> 08:35.995
I'd love to
provide you a list of

08:36.080 --> 08:37.673
all the things
I've done in Congress,

08:37.760 --> 08:38.830
but we've got
15 minutes...

08:38.919 --> 08:40.639
Your opponent has
linked your inactivity

08:40.760 --> 08:42.558
to your fondness
for single-malts.

08:44.560 --> 08:46.552
I've been very
open about my past,

08:46.720 --> 08:48.632
and I've done everything
I can to overcome it

08:48.760 --> 08:50.717
in a responsible,
permanent way.

08:52.400 --> 08:53.914
And I preferred
vodka to scotch.

08:54.040 --> 08:55.520
You should get
your facts straight.

08:58.160 --> 09:02.757
Is your Watershed Act
just a ploy to jump
into the spotlight

09:02.840 --> 09:05.958
and pad your transcript
while you apply
for governor school?

09:06.080 --> 09:08.754
It's real money.
It's real jobs.

09:10.080 --> 09:13.391
And when the Delaware River
is less polluted than
it's been in 50 years,

09:13.480 --> 09:17.030
it's holding up
a real glass of its water
and seeing how clear it is.

09:17.160 --> 09:18.560
That's what my
bus tour is about.

09:18.640 --> 09:21.519
The Vice President
is joining you later?
Correct.

09:21.640 --> 09:24.792
Why has it taken him
this long to endorse you?

09:25.720 --> 09:27.598
He didn't think
I was worth it.

09:29.080 --> 09:31.231
But then he heard
I had a one-on-one
with <i>The New York Times,</i>

09:31.320 --> 09:33.551
and, boom,
he was on board.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.074
I might print that.

09:35.160 --> 09:36.150
The more of my words,
the fewer of yours,

09:36.240 --> 09:37.230
the better off
we'll both be.

09:37.320 --> 09:40.438
If I didn't think you
were such a liability
to yourself, Congressman,

09:40.760 --> 09:42.319
I might even like you.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.153
If your circulation
was as high as
<i>The Wall Street Journal,</i>

09:44.240 --> 09:45.356
I might like you back.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.832
Hit me.
Next question.

09:48.720 --> 09:49.756
<i>I have to
put up a fight, Frank.</i>

09:49.840 --> 09:51.240
Tell them they're
wasting their money.

09:51.360 --> 09:53.113
It's gonna pass.
Are you sure?

09:53.480 --> 09:55.676
When was the last time
I got a count wrong?

09:55.760 --> 09:57.911
If you were certain,
you wouldn't
be trying to neutralize us.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.559
Well, SanCorp has been
good to me.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.597
I'm just trying to do you
and them a favor, Remy.

10:01.680 --> 10:03.399
Then why propose
the legislation
in the first place?

10:03.480 --> 10:04.630
You must've known
they would oppose it.

10:04.720 --> 10:06.598
The regulatory
restrictions are minimal.

10:06.680 --> 10:08.034
There's a bigger
battle here, Frank.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.398
SanCorp is against
any step toward regulation,

10:10.480 --> 10:11.596
no matter how small.

10:11.680 --> 10:13.717
Russo's planted
his feet on the wrong
side of the fence.

10:14.960 --> 10:16.838
How much are you
giving his opponent?

10:16.920 --> 10:18.912
Check the FEC filings.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.514
How much are you
actually giving?

10:20.640 --> 10:23.792
It's a $10 billion
industry, Frank.
There's money to spend.

10:23.880 --> 10:27.112
If the Democrats
lose Pennsylvania,
you know what that means.

10:27.200 --> 10:28.475
We don't want you
to lose leadership,

10:28.560 --> 10:29.755
but that's up to you,
not us.

10:29.880 --> 10:32.475
You don't have the same
kind of relationship
with the Republicans

10:32.560 --> 10:34.438
that you have
with me.

10:35.800 --> 10:36.950
Then we'll adapt.

10:40.920 --> 10:42.479
We both have votes
to count. Good luck.

10:43.040 --> 10:45.077
You tell SanCorp
they're being foolish.

10:45.200 --> 10:46.429
I'm not gonna do that.

10:46.520 --> 10:48.079
Well, then,
you're being foolish.

10:48.400 --> 10:51.393
Come on, Frank.
Let's not make
this personal.

10:52.440 --> 10:54.750
I can't compete with
SanCorp's war chest.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.599
My only option
is asymmetrical.

10:56.680 --> 11:00.674
To pick off
the opposition one by one
like a sniper in the woods.

11:00.840 --> 11:03.833
There will come a time
to put Remy in my crosshairs,

11:03.920 --> 11:05.479
but not right now.

11:05.600 --> 11:07.319
As we used to say
in Gaffney,

11:07.400 --> 11:09.995
"Never slap a man
while he's chewing tobacco."

11:40.040 --> 11:41.190
Congressman, how are you?

11:41.280 --> 11:43.192
I deeply appreciate you
taking the time out
of your schedule...

11:43.280 --> 11:44.919
Hank, I need to eat.

11:45.040 --> 11:48.875
See if you can rustle up
a club sandwich, extra bacon.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.120
Fuck me.

12:02.920 --> 12:03.910
Ta-da.

12:04.200 --> 12:05.998
Thai cuisine again.

12:06.480 --> 12:09.552
The green curry is for you,
and the other
green curry is for me.

12:09.640 --> 12:11.074
I was actually
just on my way out.

12:11.160 --> 12:12.958
I bought you dinner.
You have to eat it.

12:13.040 --> 12:14.997
Or at the very least,
you have to watch me
eat mine.

12:15.120 --> 12:16.520
I'm gonna be late
to meet someone.

12:16.600 --> 12:18.637
Who? Like, a date?

12:18.720 --> 12:20.120
A friend.

12:20.200 --> 12:24.080
The mysterious fuck-buddy
who you get all of
your stories from?

12:25.840 --> 12:28.560
Lighten up.
I was just teasing.

12:29.080 --> 12:31.390
Not that I would judge.
We've all done it.

12:32.840 --> 12:36.390
I used to suck, screw
and jerk anything that moved
just to get a story.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.632
Really? Like who?

12:40.920 --> 12:41.990
You want dish?

12:42.160 --> 12:43.276
No. It's just...

12:43.360 --> 12:45.591
The Comm Director
on Ben Schroeder's
Senate race.

12:45.720 --> 12:47.871
A staffer in
the Defense Department.

12:47.960 --> 12:49.872
My very own
White House intern.

12:49.960 --> 12:53.351
He was a real blabbermouth
when he wasn't eating me out.
Wow.

12:54.360 --> 12:57.876
And I even had a fling
with a Congressman.

13:00.960 --> 13:02.189
Which one?

13:03.520 --> 13:05.193
You tell me yours,
and I'll tell you mine.

13:05.280 --> 13:06.509
I've never been with any.

13:06.600 --> 13:08.319
Oh, come on.
You're hot.

13:08.400 --> 13:11.313
You're telling me
that none of them
have come on to you?

13:11.400 --> 13:13.119
I haven't really
been in those circles.

13:13.200 --> 13:14.793
You are now.

13:14.880 --> 13:16.519
I guess I don't really
give off that vibe.

13:16.600 --> 13:18.512
You mean the slut vibe?

13:18.760 --> 13:20.513
Look, I don't
do that shit anymore.

13:20.600 --> 13:23.479
'Cause once word got out,
it was like I hit a wall,

13:23.560 --> 13:25.313
and nobody
took me seriously.

13:25.400 --> 13:29.030
So, a piece of advice,
as far as career
strategies go,

13:29.160 --> 13:32.119
it's not worth fucking
your way to the middle.

13:32.200 --> 13:34.192
Chopsticks or fork?

13:36.560 --> 13:38.950
Look, if you go,
I am gonna have to
eat both of these,

13:39.040 --> 13:40.235
and that is not cool.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.390
No. I'll eat with you.

13:42.600 --> 13:43.590
Good.

13:47.200 --> 13:49.510
<i>Things have gotten underway
in Eastern Pennsylvania</i>

13:49.640 --> 13:53.236
<i>for the governor's seat
left vacant there by
Vice President Jim Matthews.</i>

13:53.320 --> 13:56.472
<i>After a political
career that has lasted
42 years so far,</i>

13:56.560 --> 13:59.439
<i>the genial Vice President
and the former
Pennsylvania Governor,</i>

13:59.520 --> 14:01.876
<i>faces the most
critical task of his
new electoral life</i>

14:01.960 --> 14:05.636
<i>helping his home state
fill the vacancy of his
departure from Washington.</i>

14:05.720 --> 14:07.439
<i>However, Matthews
seems reluctant</i>

14:07.600 --> 14:09.353
<i>to hand over the spotlight
to Peter Russo.</i>

14:18.120 --> 14:19.315
Back home, Meechum.

14:20.040 --> 14:21.110
Sir.

14:30.440 --> 14:31.999
Francis...

14:35.280 --> 14:36.953
How's your hand?

14:37.040 --> 14:38.190
Fine.

14:40.960 --> 14:43.520
You should change
the bandage, no?
Later.

14:45.960 --> 14:47.314
I thought you were
gonna be out late.

14:47.480 --> 14:48.800
No.

14:50.400 --> 14:52.278
You seem upset.
I'm not.

14:52.360 --> 14:54.477
What happened?
Nothing.

14:55.800 --> 14:58.634
Can I get more than
two words out of you?

14:59.040 --> 15:01.032
I'm just trying
to relax.

15:06.320 --> 15:09.472
Claire, I love you.

15:09.880 --> 15:11.439
I love you too.

15:14.320 --> 15:17.597
Did Zoe expect me
to twiddle my thumbs
until her arrival?

15:17.680 --> 15:19.831
Perhaps she's
making the mistake

15:19.960 --> 15:22.077
thinking her time
is as valuable as mine.

15:22.160 --> 15:25.551
Proximity to power
deludes some into
believing they wield it.

15:25.640 --> 15:28.997
I put an end to
that sort of thinking
before it begins.

15:29.080 --> 15:32.391
<i>And if I'm not mistaken,
the last time I
was in Tannersville,</i>

15:32.480 --> 15:34.119
<i>Buddy Corcharan
pulled me aside</i>

15:34.240 --> 15:35.879
<i>and told me I was
wasting my time,</i>

15:36.000 --> 15:40.358
<i>because the Republicans
were gonna sweep
Monroe County in a landslide.</i>

15:40.480 --> 15:42.915
<i>Well, Buddy had to
eat his hat
and both his shoes</i>

15:43.040 --> 15:44.599
<i>when I won the county
in a landslide.</i>

15:44.680 --> 15:46.956
<i>And let me tell you,
that man has big feet</i>

15:47.040 --> 15:48.952
<i>and an even bigger head,
so that was quite a meal.</i>

15:53.360 --> 15:56.990
<i>My daddy used to tell me
a story about people</i>

15:57.080 --> 15:59.151
<i>who count their chickens
before they hatched.</i>

15:59.240 --> 16:00.276
<i>Although, to be fair,</i>

16:00.360 --> 16:01.840
<i>he probably didn't know
what he was talking about,</i>

16:01.920 --> 16:03.832
<i>because he grew
up in Pittsburgh.</i>

16:03.920 --> 16:05.639
<i>And I certainly never saw
a hen around my house,</i>

16:05.720 --> 16:06.915
<i>unless you count my mother.</i>

16:10.040 --> 16:11.872
Do you want me
to do something?
<i>But, seriously, folks...</i>

16:12.400 --> 16:13.516
No. Let him talk.

16:13.640 --> 16:14.756
<i>...I do love this town.</i>

16:14.880 --> 16:16.633
I don't know if
he's ever going
to introduce you.

16:16.760 --> 16:19.275
He will.
Just give him time.

16:19.360 --> 16:20.430
It's been an hour.

16:20.520 --> 16:22.796
We were supposed to
leave for Carbondale
10 minutes ago.

16:22.880 --> 16:24.712
I can't interrupt him.
He's the Vice President.

16:24.800 --> 16:28.237
<i>We're not on the edge
of Penn's Woods.</i>

16:30.160 --> 16:32.550
We need economic
development flowcharts
for the Watershed Bill

16:32.640 --> 16:33.994
sent over to
Terry Womack's office.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.070
Hard copies,
20 of them.

16:35.240 --> 16:36.230
I'll do it right away.

16:37.800 --> 16:39.154
How's everything
going with Rachel?

16:39.920 --> 16:41.593
I think she's
a little down in the dumps.

16:41.680 --> 16:43.990
She got a waitressing job
last week, and then
they let her go.

16:44.320 --> 16:45.674
Why?
She wouldn't tell me.

16:45.760 --> 16:47.797
All she said was
her boss was a creep.

16:55.640 --> 16:58.394
Thirty minutes ago,
I received a text from Zoe.

16:58.520 --> 17:00.637
She intends to apologize,
no doubt.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.871
I respect that she
wants to atone in person,

17:03.000 --> 17:06.357
even though it's
taken her over 16 hours
to build up the courage.

17:22.160 --> 17:25.073
Janine Skorsky is
digging into Peter Russo.

17:26.040 --> 17:27.269
What in particular?

17:27.400 --> 17:28.834
The Shipbuilder's
Association.

17:28.920 --> 17:30.479
She have an angle?

17:30.560 --> 17:33.678
The Watershed Bill
is a consolation prize
for them losing their jobs.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.678
That's not
an unfair assessment.

17:35.760 --> 17:38.514
She thinks if
the bill fails to pass,
they'll withdraw support.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.353
Not unfair speculation.

17:42.600 --> 17:45.320
Well, I know how hard
you've been working
on his campaign,

17:45.400 --> 17:47.995
so I wanted to
give you a heads up.

17:48.360 --> 17:50.875
Well, let me know if
she expands her inquiry.

17:50.960 --> 17:52.235
Into what?

17:52.320 --> 17:54.152
Anything you deem
worth telling.

17:54.880 --> 17:56.360
Well, can I
throw her a bone?

17:56.480 --> 17:58.870
She might be more talkative
if I have information for her.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.150
What sort of bone?

18:00.320 --> 18:01.470
The vote count
for the bill.

18:01.640 --> 18:03.393
I don't have
a vote count yet.

18:03.480 --> 18:05.836
Should have
a preliminary one
this afternoon.

18:05.920 --> 18:06.910
You'll let me know?

18:07.000 --> 18:08.434
As soon as I have
something solid.

18:08.520 --> 18:09.556
There's one more thing.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.116
About last night...

18:14.200 --> 18:15.839
No need to apologize.

18:16.480 --> 18:18.039
I'm sure you had
a very good reason.

18:20.440 --> 18:21.590
I do.

18:23.360 --> 18:25.352
I think we
should end it.

18:26.440 --> 18:29.433
Not professionally,
the other thing.

18:38.360 --> 18:39.350
Why now?

18:39.440 --> 18:42.035
We have a really good
working relationship.

18:42.120 --> 18:44.840
I don't wanna
overcomplicate that.

18:45.120 --> 18:46.315
All right.

18:48.240 --> 18:49.230
You're okay with it?

18:49.360 --> 18:50.430
Completely.

18:50.520 --> 18:51.840
It's over.

18:53.880 --> 18:55.837
And it won't change things
in terms of our arrangement?

18:55.920 --> 18:59.994
Oh, please.
I don't punish people
for making adult decisions.

19:03.560 --> 19:05.279
Thank you, Francis.

19:13.680 --> 19:17.037
She was never more
than a faint blip
on my radar.

19:17.200 --> 19:19.351
We've served
each other's purpose.

19:19.440 --> 19:21.193
If she wants
to be an adult,

19:21.280 --> 19:25.354
let her see how
she can fly once
she leaves the nest.

19:37.560 --> 19:39.836
Claire. Hi.
Catherine.

19:42.200 --> 19:43.759
Thank you for
fitting me in.

19:43.840 --> 19:47.117
I can always find time
for you and Frank.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.193
Well, the reason
I'm here

19:51.280 --> 19:53.112
is the CWI has
a large shipment

19:53.280 --> 19:55.112
of water filters
stuck in South Sudan,

19:55.200 --> 19:58.193
and they've been in storage
for the past four months,

19:58.280 --> 20:00.112
just sitting there,
and the Sudanese government...

20:00.200 --> 20:01.520
Won't release the shipments
through customs.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.671
My deputy briefed
me on the latest.

20:03.800 --> 20:06.360
Right. And I know that
Francis spoke to you about
this not too long ago,

20:06.440 --> 20:08.796
but lately we haven't
heard much from
the State Department,

20:08.880 --> 20:09.950
so I was wondering
if you could help.

20:10.120 --> 20:12.476
We've done our best, Claire.
I put my top people on this.

20:12.600 --> 20:14.557
The Sudanese are
just not responding.

20:14.640 --> 20:16.836
Well, is there
anything else we can do?

20:16.920 --> 20:19.674
There's over $200,000
worth of equipment.

20:19.800 --> 20:21.553
I wish I could.
I know how important
this is to you,

20:21.640 --> 20:23.996
but we're about to
cut off diplomatic ties.

20:24.080 --> 20:25.480
It's a directive
straight from the President.

20:25.560 --> 20:29.236
We can't ignore
their human rights
violations anymore.

20:30.200 --> 20:31.429
What about
back channels?

20:31.520 --> 20:32.510
Well, once we cut ties,

20:32.600 --> 20:35.638
I can't contact
their government
officially or unofficially.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.598
Well, is there someone
you could put me
in touch with?

20:38.680 --> 20:40.478
I'm sorry, Claire.

20:40.680 --> 20:41.909
My hands are tied.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.994
I would move mountains
for you and Frank,
but I've done all I can.

20:47.920 --> 20:49.240
Of course.

20:49.960 --> 20:51.872
Okay. Good to see you.
You too.

20:53.320 --> 20:54.959
<i>Congressman,
you have a major bill</i>

20:55.080 --> 20:56.673
<i>going to the floor
later this week.</i>

20:56.760 --> 20:57.989
<i>Are you optimistic
it'll pass?</i>

20:58.080 --> 20:59.309
<i>I'm very optimistic.</i>

20:59.400 --> 21:00.834
<i>The Delaware
River Watershed Act</i>

21:00.920 --> 21:02.354
<i>not only protects
large portions of</i>

21:02.520 --> 21:03.954
<i>the state's
freshwater resources,</i>

21:04.040 --> 21:05.918
<i>it also creates
thousands of jobs.</i>

21:06.000 --> 21:07.719
<i>I'm confident that my
colleagues on the Hill...</i>

21:07.800 --> 21:09.359
<i>There's only
one way to create jobs.</i>

21:09.520 --> 21:11.079
<i>I did it during
my administration.</i>

21:11.200 --> 21:13.874
<i>The answer is tax credits
for small businesses.</i>

21:14.000 --> 21:16.356
<i>You've got to encourage
self-starting entrepreneurs</i>

21:16.440 --> 21:18.591
<i>to start new ventures,
hire employees...</i>

21:18.680 --> 21:20.273
<i>But specifically,
about the Watershed Act...</i>

21:20.360 --> 21:21.589
<i>Small businesses,
that's the solution.</i>

21:21.720 --> 21:22.949
<i>Everything else
is window dressing.</i>

21:23.040 --> 21:24.235
<i>Thank you all very much.</i>

21:26.160 --> 21:27.355
Thank you.

21:28.240 --> 21:29.515
Good night,
Mr. Vice President.

21:35.720 --> 21:36.915
Hello.

21:37.040 --> 21:38.269
<i>I need to talk
about Matthews.</i>

21:38.400 --> 21:39.720
Yes. I've read
the press reports.

21:39.880 --> 21:41.200
He's not being
very helpful, is he?

21:41.720 --> 21:43.757
No, he's doing
more harm than good.

21:43.880 --> 21:45.075
I want to ask him
to leave.

21:45.160 --> 21:46.753
Well, that wouldn't make
for a very good story.

21:46.880 --> 21:49.111
It's better than him
torpedoing the whole bus tour.

21:49.200 --> 21:50.236
<i>Have you tried
to talk to him?</i>

21:50.320 --> 21:51.720
No, I wanted to ask
your advice first.

21:53.120 --> 21:55.555
Well, maybe there's a way
to keep him on the tour

21:55.640 --> 21:56.869
and inspire his support.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.276
<i>We have fundamentally
different views.</i>

21:59.400 --> 22:01.312
Well, look, you're not
going to be able to
change his ideology,

22:01.400 --> 22:02.390
but dig deeper.

22:02.480 --> 22:05.359
<i>Jim is a proud man.
Tap into that pride.</i>

22:06.880 --> 22:08.200
I just wish
he was gone.

22:08.280 --> 22:09.794
Well, you do whatever
you think best.

22:09.880 --> 22:11.314
But whatever it is
you decide,

22:11.400 --> 22:13.312
be firm and stand up
for yourself.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.198
He'll respond
to that at least.

22:15.280 --> 22:17.158
And call me back
if you need anything.

22:22.640 --> 22:24.836
What was
the reason he gave you?
Were you messing up?

22:24.920 --> 22:28.709
No. The head waiter
said I was doing
a really good job.

22:28.800 --> 22:31.918
He even started letting me
take my own tables
on the second day.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.719
And the manager...
What's his name?

22:34.480 --> 22:35.596
Leon.

22:37.040 --> 22:38.269
He propositioned you?

22:39.360 --> 22:41.591
Called me
into his office,

22:42.480 --> 22:44.233
said couldn't afford
to start taking
anyone new on,

22:44.320 --> 22:45.834
even part-time.

22:46.160 --> 22:48.356
Put his hand on my knee,

22:48.440 --> 22:50.272
said he might be able
to make an exception.

22:51.040 --> 22:53.157
So he starts sliding
his hand up my thigh.

22:53.280 --> 22:56.671
So I stood up and I tell him
I should get back to work.

22:56.800 --> 22:58.473
He says, "Stay."

22:58.560 --> 22:59.880
He unbuckled his belt.

23:01.320 --> 23:02.913
Did you?

23:04.520 --> 23:08.150
No, I walked out of the office
and got back to my tables.

23:08.960 --> 23:12.271
Next day, I came into work,
told me to go home.

23:12.360 --> 23:13.953
I was fired.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.637
Tell me the name
of the restaurant.

23:23.240 --> 23:24.993
You're home early.

23:26.360 --> 23:28.829
I needed a breather.
I didn't have
breakfast this morning.

23:28.920 --> 23:31.435
I might head back
in a little while.

23:31.600 --> 23:33.193
The vote count?

23:35.440 --> 23:38.911
It's going to come down
to the wire on this one.

23:41.040 --> 23:43.236
I spoke to
Catherine Durant today.

23:43.720 --> 23:45.996
She's unable to
get the shipment
out of South Sudan.

23:46.080 --> 23:47.878
Yeah, we're cutting
all diplomatic ties.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.872
Foreign Affairs is
up in arms about it.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.152
Yes. Which is why she
can't lift a finger,
according to her.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.195
It's what she said,
anyway.

23:55.280 --> 23:56.509
Anyway, I need you
to talk to her.

23:56.600 --> 23:57.750
I don't think that
would make any difference.

23:59.080 --> 24:00.196
I thought she
owed us, Francis.

24:00.320 --> 24:01.436
She does,
but there's limits.

24:01.520 --> 24:03.989
She's Secretary of State.
She can't break
diplomatic protocol.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.400
Well, can you
make some calls?

24:06.480 --> 24:09.678
If she can't, I can't.
Plus I have to focus
on the Watershed Bill.

24:10.360 --> 24:12.955
I'm taking time
out of my schedule
to help you with that.

24:13.040 --> 24:15.919
Because you drafted it.
Because you asked me.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.070
I didn't want to do this.

24:17.160 --> 24:18.560
All I'm asking is
that you give me

24:18.680 --> 24:20.000
a little bit of
your time in return.

24:20.080 --> 24:21.992
And how am I
supposed to fix
a problem I can't fix?

24:23.040 --> 24:24.190
What about Remy?

24:24.280 --> 24:27.273
Glendon Hill
must have contacts
in South Sudan.

24:27.400 --> 24:28.834
He's fighting us
on the vote.

24:28.920 --> 24:31.151
Those are two completely
separate issues.

24:31.280 --> 24:34.193
They are not.
He does you a favor,
he hangs it over me.

24:37.720 --> 24:39.916
So what you're saying
is my goals are
secondary to yours.

24:40.080 --> 24:41.753
That is not
what I'm saying.

24:41.880 --> 24:43.234
I think you don't
want to go hat in hand

24:43.400 --> 24:44.720
to somebody who
used to work for you.

24:45.120 --> 24:47.760
I will not be lectured to
the moment you
walk in the door!

24:48.320 --> 24:50.312
I called Catherine,
as promised!

24:50.400 --> 24:53.234
Her inability to deliver
is not my problem
or my fault!

24:53.320 --> 24:55.710
I cannot control
changing global landscapes!

24:55.800 --> 25:00.113
And I will not be cornered
into making promises
I cannot deliver!

25:08.680 --> 25:10.433
I'm sorry I yelled.

25:13.080 --> 25:14.753
I'm under a lot
of pressure.

25:16.280 --> 25:18.954
You're right,
I didn't think it through.

25:20.440 --> 25:22.238
I just can't go
to Remy right now.

25:22.320 --> 25:23.674
He's poaching too
many of my people.

25:23.760 --> 25:26.832
I've got two congressmen
who will not commit.

25:28.200 --> 25:30.840
I was hoping you
might speak to them.

25:32.240 --> 25:33.276
Who?

25:34.120 --> 25:35.315
Vanderburgh and Abrams.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.195
What is it you want me
to say to them?

25:37.280 --> 25:38.555
They're big on
the environment.

25:38.720 --> 25:39.949
They don't think
the bill goes far enough.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.196
They respect your opinion.

25:41.280 --> 25:43.840
I wanted you
to walk them through
the bill step-by-step.

25:43.920 --> 25:46.230
Put them at ease.
I need to get them
in the yes column.

25:46.320 --> 25:48.118
I meet with them tomorrow.
I'll deliver the bruises.

25:48.200 --> 25:50.396
You meet with them
later and patch them up.

25:50.480 --> 25:52.836
That might just
do the trick.

25:54.320 --> 25:55.959
Of course.

26:00.160 --> 26:02.152
I think I broke
the bowl.

26:05.200 --> 26:08.398
We have contacts there
through our oil interests.

26:09.200 --> 26:11.157
I'm going to need
government intervention.

26:11.240 --> 26:13.436
Wherever there's a government,
we know people.

26:13.520 --> 26:15.591
Even when there's
only the illusion
of a government.

26:16.320 --> 26:17.356
Will you help me?

26:18.400 --> 26:19.800
I'd like to.

26:19.880 --> 26:22.520
But for something
like this, I'm afraid
there's a price tag.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.072
The CWI will endorse
SanCorp as eco-friendly.

26:26.160 --> 26:27.992
They can use
our logo on any PR

26:28.160 --> 26:29.992
or marketing
materials you want.

26:30.080 --> 26:31.560
We'll need
more than that.

26:32.560 --> 26:34.358
They were willing to donate
over $1 million for that.

26:34.440 --> 26:36.955
These filters are
only worth $200,000.
I'd say that's a bargain.

26:37.040 --> 26:38.793
You turned down
that offer.

26:38.880 --> 26:40.030
Landscape has
shifted since then.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.356
The Watershed Bill?
That's right.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.275
You want it amended?

26:45.840 --> 26:48.196
I want you to kill it,
the whole thing.

26:49.200 --> 26:52.079
CWI has publicly
backed the bill, Remy.

26:52.560 --> 26:55.200
What you do publicly
is your concern.

26:57.880 --> 27:01.191
Gentlemen.
Please, have a seat.

27:02.880 --> 27:07.238
So, have either of you
changed your mind
since we last spoke?

27:07.320 --> 27:09.880
We're still
undecided, Frank.

27:09.960 --> 27:11.474
Leaning one way
or the other?

27:11.560 --> 27:13.791
If Congress is
going to allocate
$250 million dollars,

27:13.880 --> 27:15.519
we want to make sure
it goes towards a bill

27:15.600 --> 27:16.636
that does more
to protect the...

27:16.720 --> 27:18.393
We've been through all that.
I know your concerns.

27:18.480 --> 27:21.518
So if the protection
standards don't change,

27:21.600 --> 27:24.479
we would rather see
that money spent more
effectively elsewhere.

27:26.080 --> 27:28.549
That sounds like
you're both leaning no.

27:28.720 --> 27:31.713
We've been very clear
about what we're asking.

27:33.400 --> 27:34.516
Okay.

27:38.440 --> 27:40.432
This is you, Abrams.

27:41.680 --> 27:43.876
And this is you,
Vanderburgh.

27:44.640 --> 27:45.630
And over here

27:54.200 --> 27:56.431
is the majority of
the Democratic Caucus.

27:56.920 --> 27:59.037
See, you're over there
all by your lonesome.

27:59.120 --> 28:01.032
Now, you don't mind
being the black sheep.

28:01.120 --> 28:02.679
You're the liberal wing
of the liberal wing.

28:03.160 --> 28:06.676
Most of the time you
can vote what you want,
we still pass things anyway.

28:06.760 --> 28:09.434
But this time
it does matter.

28:10.880 --> 28:12.678
And what the two of you
aren't taking into account

28:12.760 --> 28:15.434
is between this
end of the desk
and this end of the desk,

28:16.480 --> 28:17.516
is me.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.957
Now, I'm going to say
to you what I say
to every congressman

28:20.040 --> 28:21.315
that sits where
you're sitting now.

28:21.960 --> 28:24.794
Vote your district.
Vote your conscience.

28:24.880 --> 28:26.519
Don't surprise me.

28:26.640 --> 28:29.519
And the most
important one of those

28:31.360 --> 28:33.591
is don't surprise me.

28:34.840 --> 28:37.400
Now, you're both to meet
with my wife tomorrow.

28:37.480 --> 28:39.312
And you're to
hear her out.

28:39.400 --> 28:42.040
She will go through your
concerns point-by-point.

28:42.120 --> 28:44.635
And I am certain after that

28:44.720 --> 28:48.760
that the two of you
will make the right decision.

28:53.200 --> 28:55.157
This is the part
where you leave.

29:01.920 --> 29:03.912
I have often found
that bleeding hearts

29:04.000 --> 29:06.560
have an ironic fear
of their own blood.

29:06.680 --> 29:08.433
One drop
and they seize up.

29:08.520 --> 29:12.116
But offer them a caring hand
and massage them back to life

29:12.240 --> 29:14.994
and they soon start
beating to the right drum.

29:16.160 --> 29:17.150
Hello.

29:17.240 --> 29:19.038
<i>I've just spoken to
Abrams and Vanderburgh.</i>

29:19.160 --> 29:21.595
Let them toss
and turn tonight,

29:21.680 --> 29:23.512
but they're
all yours tomorrow.

29:24.120 --> 29:26.430
I'll reach out to their
offices and set a time.

29:27.080 --> 29:28.480
Thank you, Claire.

29:28.760 --> 29:31.355
Of course.
Whatever I can do to help.

29:35.720 --> 29:37.598
Here you go, sir. Enjoy.

29:39.200 --> 29:41.840
Excuse me.
There's a hair on my steak.

29:41.920 --> 29:43.673
I am so sorry, sir.
Where?

29:44.360 --> 29:45.953
Right there.

29:47.720 --> 29:48.870
I don't see it.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.434
Are you telling me
I'm blind?

29:50.520 --> 29:53.194
No, sir. I'm so sorry.
I'll have the kitchen...

29:53.280 --> 29:55.192
What's your name?
Stephanie.

29:55.960 --> 29:56.996
You can leave the plate,
Stephanie.

29:57.120 --> 29:58.156
I'd like to talk
to the manager.

29:59.280 --> 30:00.794
Yes, sir.
I'll go get him.

30:00.880 --> 30:02.200
Thank you.

30:12.400 --> 30:13.629
Good evening, sir.

30:14.680 --> 30:17.593
Stephanie tells me
there was a hair
on your plate.

30:18.160 --> 30:19.150
No.

30:21.200 --> 30:23.715
There wasn't any hair.
Leon, right?
That's your name?

30:24.600 --> 30:25.670
Yes.

30:26.080 --> 30:27.799
Stephanie is a hot
little number, isn't she?

30:29.480 --> 30:30.470
Nice ass.

30:32.760 --> 30:34.752
Did you make her
blow you before
or after you hired her?

30:37.800 --> 30:39.154
Sir, I'm going to
have to ask you to leave.

30:39.240 --> 30:41.152
Sit down, Leon.
Sir, I want you to go.

30:41.240 --> 30:43.232
I said sit.
Don't make me
call the police.

30:43.400 --> 30:44.800
I'll tell you what.

30:44.880 --> 30:47.440
You call the police,
I'll call the Department
of Immigration

30:47.520 --> 30:49.079
about the four
undocumented employees

30:49.280 --> 30:50.839
you have working
in the kitchen.

30:50.920 --> 30:51.910
A felony, Leon.

30:53.280 --> 30:56.318
And I might also
mention your girlfriend,
her mother, and her aunt

30:56.400 --> 30:59.518
who are also undocumented
and living in
an apartment you pay for.

31:00.320 --> 31:03.154
Prison time for you,
deportation for them.

31:04.360 --> 31:05.840
Not a pretty picture,
is it?

31:16.560 --> 31:19.120
Let's talk
about Rachel Posner.

31:20.120 --> 31:21.110
How close is it?

31:21.200 --> 31:24.159
I should have
the last two votes
I need committed today.

31:24.240 --> 31:26.072
I just want to make sure
no one changes their mind.

31:26.800 --> 31:28.792
I'd prefer not
to get embroiled

31:28.960 --> 31:30.952
in environmental
issues at this time.

31:31.080 --> 31:33.117
But it's also
a jobs creation package.

31:33.200 --> 31:34.873
It's antagonizing
oil and gas.

31:34.960 --> 31:36.519
We can't afford
that sort of battle

31:36.640 --> 31:38.199
after all the capital
we spent on education.

31:38.320 --> 31:41.313
All I need is one
public statement
of support.

31:41.440 --> 31:43.397
I won't do that.
How about you
take Linda tomorrow?

31:43.480 --> 31:45.358
You set her up
in your offices.

31:45.440 --> 31:47.830
Any meetings or calls
you might need
to whip up votes,

31:47.920 --> 31:48.990
you've got her there.

31:49.080 --> 31:50.992
Well, I can't afford
to spend a whole day
lobbying on the Hill.

31:51.080 --> 31:52.309
Well, you've got deputies.

31:52.840 --> 31:54.035
Yes, I do.

31:54.120 --> 31:56.680
Well, you're telling me
you can't manage them
from 10 blocks away?

31:56.760 --> 31:57.989
Of course I can, sir.

31:58.120 --> 31:59.349
Look, if it's
too difficult...

31:59.440 --> 32:02.035
No, no, no.
We'll help you out, Frank.
Won't we, Linda?

32:02.480 --> 32:03.880
Yes. If you'll
just excuse me,

32:03.960 --> 32:06.429
I have a few
things to rearrange
on my schedule.

32:06.520 --> 32:09.513
What else, Frank?
Tell me what
Birch is up to.

32:09.600 --> 32:11.000
No, I know I've
already canceled twice.

32:12.840 --> 32:14.832
They start next week.

32:14.920 --> 32:16.673
Sweetie, I'm trying
to figure this out.

32:16.760 --> 32:18.592
Linda.
Excuse me. Yes?

32:18.680 --> 32:20.672
I just wanted to thank you
for agreeing to pitch in,

32:20.760 --> 32:21.750
I know you have
a full plate.

32:21.840 --> 32:22.830
Of course, Frank.

32:23.280 --> 32:24.555
Is everything all right?
It sounds like...

32:24.640 --> 32:26.632
Yes. What time
do you want me
to come by tomorrow?

32:28.360 --> 32:29.680
Can we talk?

32:30.240 --> 32:34.075
Can I just call you
back in one second?
I will call you. Yes.

32:35.400 --> 32:38.234
Linda, I am so sorry
that the President has
forced you into this.

32:38.320 --> 32:39.276
It was not my intention.

32:39.360 --> 32:40.953
If you would like,
I can talk to Congress...

32:41.040 --> 32:44.078
No, it's not that.
It's a personal matter.
Don't worry.

32:44.160 --> 32:45.913
Well, what is it?
Maybe I can help.

32:46.720 --> 32:48.632
Just, my son didn't
get into Stanford.

32:48.720 --> 32:50.040
I was supposed to meet
with the Provost tomorrow

32:50.120 --> 32:51.873
to see if I could get
him to change his mind.

32:51.960 --> 32:53.997
I asked the President
if I could go,
and he said yes,

32:54.080 --> 32:55.196
but he must
have forgotten.

32:55.280 --> 32:57.158
You should go.
I'm sure the President
will understand.

32:57.240 --> 32:58.515
No, no. I don't let
personal matters

32:58.640 --> 32:59.915
get in the way
of my job, Frank.

33:00.040 --> 33:02.316
Linda, you can't put
your entire life on hold.

33:02.400 --> 33:04.312
And certainly
not at the expense
of your own son.

33:04.400 --> 33:06.471
Well, it has been
at the expense of my son.

33:06.560 --> 33:08.631
It's my fault
he didn't get in.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.189
I was on the campaign
and I wasn't there for him.

33:11.280 --> 33:14.114
His grades suffered.
His application was...

33:14.560 --> 33:16.040
I wasn't there, Frank.

33:16.120 --> 33:17.440
But I figured if
I could just meet

33:17.560 --> 33:18.960
with the Provost
face to face...

33:19.040 --> 33:21.430
Okay, look,
you are going to
Stanford tomorrow.

33:21.560 --> 33:23.756
If you show up at my office,
I won't let you in,

33:23.840 --> 33:24.876
so don't even consider it.

33:24.960 --> 33:26.758
Frank, the President
wants me to be...

33:26.840 --> 33:28.274
He doesn't have to know.

33:28.400 --> 33:30.960
I'm going to have
one of my schedulers
buy you a ticket.

33:31.040 --> 33:32.474
The bill will be fine.

33:32.560 --> 33:33.914
Frank.

33:35.280 --> 33:36.430
You don't
have to do this.

33:36.920 --> 33:38.718
We may have our
disagreements, Linda,

33:38.800 --> 33:41.395
but that doesn't mean
we can't look out
for each other.

33:41.480 --> 33:44.279
You tell them
you're coming.

33:46.600 --> 33:48.273
Okay. Give that a try.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.350
Test, test, test.

33:49.440 --> 33:51.591
<i>All right, Zoe.
This is Dave, the senior
producer in New York.</i>

33:51.720 --> 33:53.757
<i>We'll go live
in four minutes.</i>
Sounds good.

33:53.840 --> 33:56.355
<i>The first topic will
be the Congressional
agenda for the fall session,</i>

33:56.440 --> 33:57.954
<i>then we'll move
on to the midterms,</i>

33:58.040 --> 33:59.918
<i>then we'll wrap it up
with Peter Russo's
race for governor</i>

34:00.000 --> 34:01.559
<i>and his Watershed Bill.</i>
Okay, great.

34:01.640 --> 34:03.871
<i>Taking you off
mic until 30 out.</i>

34:03.960 --> 34:06.191
Hey, Janine, I have to talk
about the Watershed Bill.

34:06.280 --> 34:07.509
Do you have a one sheet?

34:07.640 --> 34:09.074
Yeah. Hold on.

34:17.480 --> 34:18.630
Thanks.

34:18.719 --> 34:19.870
Any word on
the vote count?

34:20.000 --> 34:21.228
Still no luck.

34:21.320 --> 34:24.313
I've called every
Democrat in the House
to cobble together a number,

34:24.400 --> 34:26.119
but no one's
getting back to me.

34:26.199 --> 34:27.839
So what can I say?

34:28.000 --> 34:30.958
That there's
a lot in flux,
and it'll be tight.

34:31.040 --> 34:32.315
Okay. Thanks.

34:32.440 --> 34:34.079
Yeah. Sure thing.

34:46.159 --> 34:49.072
Hey, Francis, it's me.
Call me back.

34:51.159 --> 34:52.355
Yes.

34:53.400 --> 34:56.279
Congressman Russo.
He says it's urgent.

34:56.360 --> 34:57.430
Fine.

35:00.800 --> 35:02.314
Good morning, sir.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.278
I'd like to talk about
how the tour's going.

35:04.360 --> 35:06.431
Well, let's talk on the bus.
Don't we have
an event at 11:00?

35:06.520 --> 35:08.193
There won't be any
events until we talk.

35:11.040 --> 35:12.759
You're hijacking
the microphone.

35:13.120 --> 35:14.520
You're contradicting
everything I say.

35:14.600 --> 35:16.512
We need to be promoting
the Watershed Act.

35:17.280 --> 35:20.557
Well, I appreciate
your being so forthright.

35:21.560 --> 35:23.870
Let me tell you what
I don't appreciate.

35:24.080 --> 35:27.312
The DNC is running a man
with zero track record,

35:27.400 --> 35:29.756
except for substance abuse,
to fill my shoes.

35:29.840 --> 35:31.069
I realize you don't
want to be here, sir,

35:31.160 --> 35:34.437
but it seems like
you're deliberately trying
to sabotage my campaign.

35:34.520 --> 35:36.796
Despite my better judgment,
I'm trying to save it.

35:37.200 --> 35:39.112
I know
the people of this state
better than you, Peter.

35:39.240 --> 35:41.630
They don't want to
hear about watersheds.
They want to hear about jobs.

35:41.720 --> 35:42.915
Well, this week,
they need to hear both.

35:43.040 --> 35:44.315
Well, then,
maybe I should just stand

35:44.440 --> 35:45.669
quietly beside
you at the podium

35:45.760 --> 35:46.716
and watch you lose.

35:46.840 --> 35:48.797
You don't think I
can win, do you?
I'm not optimistic.

35:48.880 --> 35:51.349
You lost the first two times
you ran for governor.

35:51.440 --> 35:53.671
The third time,
nobody thought
you had a chance.

35:53.760 --> 35:57.231
By September,
you were 15 points down.
You were out of money.

35:57.320 --> 35:58.390
You had to mortgage
your own house

35:58.560 --> 35:59.630
just to keep your
staff on payroll.

35:59.760 --> 36:01.319
I'm well aware
of what I did.
I was there.

36:01.400 --> 36:02.993
My point is
you kept going.

36:03.080 --> 36:05.675
You hit 67 counties
in less than 20 days,

36:05.760 --> 36:07.752
and you proved
everyone wrong.

36:07.840 --> 36:10.036
Like it or not,
it's my name on
the ticket this time,

36:10.120 --> 36:12.635
and I got the shot,
and I'm gonna
prove everyone wrong,

36:12.720 --> 36:14.598
just like you did.
Including you, sir.

36:15.240 --> 36:16.799
I would like
your support,

36:16.880 --> 36:19.270
but if you
won't give it, fine.

36:20.080 --> 36:21.275
It won't stop me.

36:25.240 --> 36:27.835
You think it's easy
for me to be here?

36:28.160 --> 36:30.550
I left the Governor's mansion
right in my prime.

36:30.840 --> 36:32.399
To be what?
Vice President.

36:32.480 --> 36:34.392
I thought that
was a step up.

36:34.480 --> 36:37.234
But you know what?
I don't have a fucking
shred of real influence.

36:37.840 --> 36:41.231
I'm trotted around
like a goddamn mascot,
and this is my home state.

36:42.920 --> 36:45.071
I'm offering you
influence, sir.

36:46.480 --> 36:49.598
I'd like your guidance
and your expertise.

36:51.080 --> 36:53.879
But if that's not on
the table, then, well...

36:53.960 --> 36:55.952
With all due respect,
Mr. Vice President,

36:56.080 --> 36:58.072
you should head
back to Washington.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.074
<i>Your husband
was very explicit.</i>

37:10.240 --> 37:11.993
I would categorize it
as a threat.

37:12.080 --> 37:14.037
What did he say exactly?

37:14.120 --> 37:15.839
Not to surprise him.

37:15.960 --> 37:18.634
Didn't he also tell you
to vote your district
and your conscience?

37:18.760 --> 37:23.277
He did, but those
seemed far lower
on his priority list.

37:23.360 --> 37:24.794
Well, he would
never fault you

37:24.880 --> 37:27.395
if you had a compelling reason
to do what you think is right.

37:27.480 --> 37:30.040
I'm confused.
Aren't you for this bill?

37:31.200 --> 37:33.078
CWI is publicly for it.

37:33.160 --> 37:36.232
Privately, I have my doubts
for the same reasons you do.

37:36.320 --> 37:38.391
I was under the impression
that we were here

37:38.520 --> 37:40.557
so you could
persuade us to vote yes.

37:40.640 --> 37:43.200
I'm not trying to
persuade you of anything.

37:44.080 --> 37:45.355
I will say this.

37:45.440 --> 37:48.194
If the bill fails,
it's not the end
of the world.

37:48.280 --> 37:50.840
We can always
sponsor new legislation.

37:50.920 --> 37:53.833
You know, something
with stricter
regulatory standards.

37:53.920 --> 37:55.593
Just to be clear,
you're telling us

37:55.720 --> 37:57.393
you don't mind if we
vote against the bill?

37:58.480 --> 38:00.517
I'm simply saying
what my husband would...

38:00.600 --> 38:03.354
That you should
vote your conscience.

38:04.800 --> 38:06.075
<i>How are we looking?</i>

38:06.720 --> 38:07.756
We're short a vote.

38:07.840 --> 38:08.910
I just got off
the phone with Claire.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.639
Vanderburgh and Abrams
are on board.

38:10.720 --> 38:12.712
Those are definite yeses?
Definite.

38:12.800 --> 38:14.439
We should be good.

38:15.200 --> 38:16.236
Yes?

38:16.320 --> 38:18.073
I've been trying to
reach you since yesterday.

38:18.200 --> 38:20.351
<i>Well, I've been a bit
busy counting votes.</i>

38:20.440 --> 38:21.715
You said you'd
have a number for me.

38:21.840 --> 38:23.593
<i>Well, you should
try my press office.</i>

38:23.720 --> 38:25.791
I did.
They won't return
my calls.

38:25.920 --> 38:28.435
Well, the official word
is it will be close.

38:28.520 --> 38:29.954
I'm trying to get
the unofficial word.

38:30.120 --> 38:32.794
I can't appear to be
playing favorites now,
can I?

38:33.880 --> 38:35.553
This isn't because of
the other day, is it?

38:35.640 --> 38:36.710
What other day?

38:38.440 --> 38:40.716
You said we'd keep
our professional
relationship.

38:40.800 --> 38:43.076
Well, this is what
professional feels like.

38:49.040 --> 38:53.159
The Vice President
of the United States,
Jim Matthews!

38:58.080 --> 38:59.230
Thank you.

38:59.800 --> 39:02.269
It's good to be
back in Bristol.

39:03.920 --> 39:05.513
Go, warriors!

39:07.680 --> 39:10.070
Now, you all know me.
I'm a windbag.

39:10.200 --> 39:13.193
I can go on until
you all fall asleep,

39:13.280 --> 39:16.273
get eight hours of shut-eye,
and wake up to
find me still yapping.

39:17.600 --> 39:20.957
And there's a lot
I could say about this
young man to my left.

39:21.520 --> 39:25.560
The truth is,
I've had a lot of doubts
about him and his ideas,

39:25.640 --> 39:27.233
about his past,

39:27.760 --> 39:28.989
about his youth.

39:29.120 --> 39:30.918
But if you'll remember,

39:31.000 --> 39:34.311
a lot of you had
doubts about me
the first time I ran.

39:34.400 --> 39:37.234
And the second and the third.

39:39.480 --> 39:41.676
But over the last few days,

39:41.760 --> 39:44.434
traveling around
the state with Peter,

39:44.960 --> 39:46.633
I have to admit
he's won me over.

39:46.880 --> 39:50.794
He's smart, he's energetic,
and most important,
he's a fighter.

39:51.960 --> 39:55.237
Now, it says "A fresh start!"
on that bus over there.

39:55.360 --> 39:57.397
And that's the real truth,

39:57.480 --> 39:59.392
because this young man
will give our state

39:59.520 --> 40:01.432
the fresh start
it so desperately needs.

40:01.960 --> 40:04.350
Ladies and gentlemen,
the next Governor
of Pennsylvania,

40:04.440 --> 40:05.760
Peter Russo.

40:14.840 --> 40:16.433
Thank you,
Mr. Vice President.

40:17.760 --> 40:19.717
How's it going, Bristol?

40:21.040 --> 40:24.431
Today I'd like to talk to you
about economic recovery.

40:24.520 --> 40:26.000
Now, as many of you
may be aware,

40:26.080 --> 40:27.753
mostly because my opponent

40:27.840 --> 40:31.151
feels the need to
spend millions of dollars
on TV ads about my past,

40:31.280 --> 40:32.634
I know a thing or two
about recovery.

40:34.600 --> 40:38.355
I've learned a great deal
through my personal struggles.

40:38.440 --> 40:42.673
I've learned how to
harness my strength
and my resolve,

40:42.800 --> 40:44.234
make them work for me,

40:44.320 --> 40:46.835
much the way your
Bristol watermills

40:46.920 --> 40:49.515
harnessed the power of
your beautiful Otter Creek

40:49.600 --> 40:52.399
and the mighty
Delaware River years ago.

40:52.600 --> 40:55.160
Let me tell you how
the Delaware River

40:55.240 --> 40:58.199
will reinvigorate your economy
for years to come!

41:03.720 --> 41:05.393
We're going to get
the shipment out of Sudan.

41:05.520 --> 41:07.557
That's great.
It might take
a few weeks,

41:07.680 --> 41:09.797
but I think you should
start making arrangements
for Botswana,

41:09.880 --> 41:12.315
where you're gonna
set up base camp
and the depot.

41:12.400 --> 41:15.677
Just send me a budget
as soon as you've got one.

41:16.280 --> 41:19.990
Claire, is there any way
we can send
someone in my place?

41:20.480 --> 41:22.039
I thought you wanted
to be on the ground.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.798
I would,
but I can't this time.

41:26.400 --> 41:27.356
Why not?

41:27.440 --> 41:32.117
I wasn't sure how
to tell you this,
but I passed the 12-week mark.

41:34.320 --> 41:35.515
You're expecting?

41:36.800 --> 41:38.393
Gillian,
that's wonderful.

41:38.520 --> 41:41.240
That...
When did this happen?
Who's the father?

41:41.320 --> 41:44.279
There was this
guy I met overseas.
Doctors Without Borders.

41:44.400 --> 41:46.517
We had this thing.
Then I left.

41:47.080 --> 41:49.117
But he came back to
the States a few months ago,

41:49.200 --> 41:51.351
and that's
when it happened.

41:51.560 --> 41:53.313
Anyway, it didn't end well.

41:53.440 --> 41:54.954
But I want to
keep the baby.

41:55.040 --> 41:56.759
And does he know?

41:56.960 --> 41:58.076
He's married.

41:59.600 --> 42:02.911
I shouldn't have.
It was stupid.
You don't have to explain.

42:04.080 --> 42:05.958
I'll need some time off
at the beginning of March.

42:06.080 --> 42:07.434
Of course.

42:08.120 --> 42:10.954
And absolutely,
we'll send
someone else instead.

42:11.040 --> 42:12.838
I appreciate it,
Claire.

42:12.960 --> 42:14.155
Sure.

42:20.480 --> 42:21.914
<i>You said medium rare?</i>

42:23.200 --> 42:26.238
Just let me know
if you guys need anything.

42:50.080 --> 42:52.720
Who would you guess
texted me just now?

42:52.880 --> 42:54.712
I thought she'd last
more than a couple days.

42:59.200 --> 43:00.680
Going somewhere?
Just for
an hour or two.

43:00.760 --> 43:03.320
I got one last
hold-out to whip.

43:44.920 --> 43:46.912
What's the vote count
on Russo's bill?

43:48.400 --> 43:51.837
Don't you wanna shower first
before we dirty
ourselves with business?

43:51.920 --> 43:55.311
I'll shower after you leave.
What's the vote count?

43:57.080 --> 44:00.278
Your tone doesn't inspire me
to be very forthcoming.

44:00.400 --> 44:04.030
The fuck wasn't enough?
You need a special tone too?

44:04.760 --> 44:05.796
Ooh...

44:05.880 --> 44:09.112
Someone washed her mouth
out with acid this morning.

44:09.720 --> 44:11.393
Whatever it is
you're grappling with,

44:11.480 --> 44:13.312
I am sincerely
not interested.

44:13.400 --> 44:15.153
You're almost
twice my age.

44:17.040 --> 44:18.235
You said that
didn't bother you.

44:18.360 --> 44:19.555
I lied.

44:20.200 --> 44:22.476
If you had a daughter,
she'd be older than me.

44:22.560 --> 44:25.678
In 20 years,
I'll still be younger
than you are now.

44:25.760 --> 44:27.991
Well, I can't argue
with basic arithmetic.

44:28.120 --> 44:29.634
You don't find
that disgusting?

44:32.080 --> 44:34.072
I think you want me to.

44:34.160 --> 44:37.073
But I've never considered
this any more or less

44:37.160 --> 44:40.358
than a transaction
between two consenting adults.

44:40.440 --> 44:42.511
If you just want the girl
who will do your
bidding for you,

44:42.600 --> 44:44.432
you already have that.

44:44.520 --> 44:45.840
Why do you need
to fuck me?

44:47.120 --> 44:49.715
I would remind you
that it was you who
initiated our affair,

44:49.800 --> 44:53.077
and it was you
who came knocking
at my door last winter.

44:53.160 --> 44:56.119
And it was me who asked
that we stop what
we're doing now.

44:56.240 --> 44:58.516
Which I respected
until you picked up a phone

44:58.600 --> 45:00.398
and asked me to
come over tonight.

45:00.520 --> 45:03.160
Because you wouldn't give me
what I wanted unless I did.

45:04.960 --> 45:07.475
So tell me,
why do you need this?

45:07.800 --> 45:09.359
You don't seem to get
any pleasure out of it.

45:09.440 --> 45:11.432
I know I certainly don't.

45:12.960 --> 45:15.555
I seem to always
leave you satisfied.

45:16.560 --> 45:18.517
How do you know
I'm not faking it?

45:22.560 --> 45:23.630
Are you?

45:23.760 --> 45:26.719
Doesn't it say a lot
that you can't tell?

45:36.920 --> 45:39.674
What do you think about
when I'm up against the wall?

45:41.440 --> 45:45.400
A great man once said
that "Everything in
life is about sex...

45:47.040 --> 45:48.838
"Except sex.

45:49.680 --> 45:52.240
"Sex is about power."

45:53.080 --> 45:54.992
So you need a whore,

45:55.960 --> 45:57.155
which makes you a pimp.

45:57.240 --> 46:00.870
I'm not a pimp.
Just a very generous john.

46:04.840 --> 46:05.830
Fine.

46:07.000 --> 46:11.074
As long as we're
clear about what this is,
I can play the whore.

46:11.760 --> 46:13.160
Now pay me.

46:14.600 --> 46:17.035
The bill will pass.
We have it by two votes.

46:17.720 --> 46:21.350
You can pass that
along to your friend,
Ms. Skorsky.

46:23.040 --> 46:26.431
If she must say such things
in order to sleep
at night, so be it.

46:26.520 --> 46:29.479
Her loyalty costs me
nothing but the occasional
crumb of news.

46:29.560 --> 46:32.234
Her hatefulness
takes no toll at all.

46:32.840 --> 46:36.800
You don't
compensate a working girl
so you can cuddle after.

46:36.880 --> 46:38.075
<i>Final voting...</i>

46:38.160 --> 46:41.153
A lot of small
towns, some really
great crowds.

46:42.080 --> 46:44.072
No buses losing
their brakes.
<i>Final call for voting.</i>

46:44.160 --> 46:46.152
Please, no.
When do you head back?

46:46.280 --> 46:48.715
Tomorrow. We wanna
do a press conference
when all the votes are in.

46:48.800 --> 46:50.280
<i>Members, please cast
your votes now.</i>

46:50.360 --> 46:51.396
Are you all right?

46:51.560 --> 46:52.596
I'm just
a little nauseous.

46:52.680 --> 46:54.512
It'll pass.
I'm okay.

46:55.600 --> 46:56.636
You said
you're due in March?

46:56.760 --> 46:57.796
March 14th.

46:57.880 --> 46:58.996
It must be
so exciting.

46:59.080 --> 47:00.070
How's the morning sickness?

47:00.160 --> 47:02.072
I think I'm over the hump.
I have to pee all the time.

47:02.520 --> 47:04.113
Weird cravings.

47:05.240 --> 47:06.754
It was good
to be on the road again.

47:06.880 --> 47:07.950
Invigorating.

47:08.080 --> 47:09.958
Our internals are showing
a nice bump in the numbers.

47:10.040 --> 47:11.474
You made
a big difference, sir.

47:11.560 --> 47:13.916
The President
is grateful,
and so am I.

47:14.000 --> 47:15.992
Well, it's a team
effort, right?

47:16.080 --> 47:19.596
Excuse me.
I have yet to say hello
to your better half.

47:19.760 --> 47:20.830
How'd it go at Stanford?

47:20.960 --> 47:22.076
Well, I think.

47:22.160 --> 47:24.595
The Dean's a Republican,
so there was not
a lot of small talk.

47:24.720 --> 47:26.200
But he seemed open
to considering it.

47:26.320 --> 47:28.232
We'll know
more next week.
That's terrific.

47:28.320 --> 47:29.595
I appreciate
your helping me out.

47:29.680 --> 47:31.831
I didn't do anything.
Anybody could
book a plane ticket.

47:31.920 --> 47:33.752
That's not true.
You covered for me.

47:33.840 --> 47:37.151
Well, we have to keep
the important things
in perspective, right?

47:37.240 --> 47:39.596
Don't think it's
bought you any favors.

47:39.760 --> 47:42.514
Kindness isn't kindness
if you expect a reward.

47:42.920 --> 47:44.639
The man of the hour!

47:44.720 --> 47:46.552
Not yet. The votes
are still coming in.

47:46.640 --> 47:48.472
Hey, how'd you vote?
I voted yes.

47:49.120 --> 47:50.839
Voting.
I knew I forgot something.

47:50.920 --> 47:51.876
We got this.

47:51.960 --> 47:54.634
There's some
sparkling grape juice
there to celebrate.

47:54.720 --> 47:55.915
<i>Thirty seconds remaining.</i>

47:56.880 --> 47:59.236
Thirty seconds.
Looking good.

48:01.800 --> 48:02.950
<i>Come on, everyone.
Let's go.</i>

48:03.040 --> 48:04.793
<i>Everyone's voting
along party lines.</i>

48:06.920 --> 48:09.310
<i>See?
This is what happens when
we all stick together.</i>

48:09.400 --> 48:10.834
<i>This is an easy win for us.</i>

48:10.920 --> 48:12.479
<i>Fifteen seconds.</i>

48:15.200 --> 48:16.236
<i>Vote now.</i>

48:16.320 --> 48:17.549
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

48:18.440 --> 48:20.193
Fuck. This can't
be happening.

48:20.320 --> 48:22.312
<i>Members, please cast
your votes now.</i>

48:26.520 --> 48:30.400
<i>Voting is closed.
H.R. 4913 is defeated.</i>

48:30.720 --> 48:32.871
Doug.
I thought we had it.

48:33.240 --> 48:35.152
So this
means it's dead?

48:35.240 --> 48:38.119
It's such a shame.
All of that hard work.

48:39.760 --> 48:41.672
I wanna know who lied.

48:42.305 --> 48:48.288
