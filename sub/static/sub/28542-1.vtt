01:19.644 --> 01:21.951
It's hard to remember,

01:21.994 --> 01:24.475
to hold on to more
than a few hugs.

01:24.519 --> 01:29.045
The line between what I saw and what I thought I saw is blurred.

01:30.742 --> 01:33.702
I remember it was a
cold summer.

01:33.745 --> 01:35.878
There was more cold to come.

01:36.879 --> 01:38.837
Cold in our house, too.

01:41.188 --> 01:44.016
And in the town, they'd watch
my mother's every step.

01:45.192 --> 01:47.977
I remember moments,

01:48.020 --> 01:51.415
half understood then,
and now too long gone.

01:53.069 --> 01:55.376
The bees dancing.

01:55.419 --> 01:57.204
The sound of whispers.

01:58.379 --> 02:00.903
Secrets everywhere.

02:00.946 --> 02:05.125
How could I have known what
would happen when they were
told?

03:13.671 --> 03:14.977
♪ Down by the river

03:15.020 --> 03:17.893
♪ Where the green wicks grow

03:17.936 --> 03:21.940
♪ There sat Irene giving
him a bow ♪

03:21.984 --> 03:25.335
♪ Up came Charlie's dad
and kissed her on the bum... ♪

03:25.379 --> 03:27.990
You all right, Charlie boy?

03:28.033 --> 03:31.472
Uh, have
you been scrapping, Charlie
Weekes?

03:31.515 --> 03:34.475
-Joe took my marbles.
-Well, did you count to ten?

03:34.518 --> 03:37.391
I did, but he still had
my marbles.

03:37.434 --> 03:39.306
Come on home for your tea.

03:42.787 --> 03:45.921
So where shall I say you are
tonight if your mum comes
looking?

03:45.964 --> 03:48.663
-Church.

03:48.706 --> 03:52.232
You should come. Mum said you
used to like a dance.

03:52.275 --> 03:54.103
She said more than that, I bet.

03:56.366 --> 03:58.890
Uh, Charlie,
I don't want these in the house.

03:58.934 --> 04:01.806
They're for skimming. Dad said
we could go in the summer.

04:06.028 --> 04:09.031
I'm not sure when your dad's
gonna be back, Charlie.

04:10.685 --> 04:12.556
I want to find more stones
for Dad.

04:15.255 --> 04:19.259
He's rooming with her,
apparently. Sneaking past her
landlady.

04:20.781 --> 04:22.523
Wave at your Aunty Pam.

04:29.356 --> 04:31.445
-Well, I'll see you tomorrow.
-Hm-hmm.

04:32.533 --> 04:34.622
- Bye!

04:48.375 --> 04:50.202
Charlie, boots.

04:55.599 --> 04:57.819
Uh...

05:27.327 --> 05:30.765
- Mum?
-Yes, love?

05:30.808 --> 05:33.333
-Do you want me to read to you?

05:34.334 --> 05:35.422
Yeah.

05:35.465 --> 05:37.685
That'd be nice.

05:43.995 --> 05:48.260
"It was one o'clock when we left
No.3, Lauriston Gardens."

05:48.304 --> 05:52.308
"Sherlock Holmes led me to the
nearest telephone office..."

06:15.505 --> 06:17.594
Get off me!

06:27.561 --> 06:29.084
Charlie?

06:29.127 --> 06:31.303
Whoa, whoa, slow down,
slow down.

06:32.304 --> 06:34.394
What's the matter?

06:39.007 --> 06:41.183
They were saying things
about Mum.

06:42.750 --> 06:44.142
Come on.

06:46.971 --> 06:49.017
I don't want Mum to know
I was scrapping.

06:49.060 --> 06:51.280
Don't worry,
we'll think of something.

06:51.323 --> 06:53.674
- Come in.

06:57.286 --> 07:00.855
Oh, dear. What's happened here?

07:00.898 --> 07:02.987
I tripped over a stone.

07:05.860 --> 07:07.557
Can you show me where it hurts?

07:09.298 --> 07:12.257
I'm Dr. Markham.
What's your name?

07:12.301 --> 07:15.739
- Charlie.
-When did you hurt it?

07:15.783 --> 07:18.002
- After school.
-You're his sister?

07:18.046 --> 07:20.570
-Cousin.
-Where's his mother?

07:20.614 --> 07:22.354
She's got chickenpox.

07:22.398 --> 07:23.791
Charlie.

07:25.923 --> 07:28.491
Well, it's just a bruise.

07:29.187 --> 07:30.450
Nothing broken.

07:33.888 --> 07:36.934
That's a
honeycomb. Do you like bees?

07:36.978 --> 07:39.502
Hmm.

07:39.546 --> 07:41.417
They make these with their
mouths.

07:41.461 --> 07:45.029
A man made that one
with a chisel and a mallet.

07:45.073 --> 07:47.423
- Who was it?
-My father.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.208
He was the doctor here.

07:50.252 --> 07:53.995
-Where is he now?
-He's gone.

07:57.781 --> 08:00.088
There are hives in your garden.

08:02.569 --> 08:04.092
Would you like to see them?

08:05.833 --> 08:09.010
All right. Come by
on Sunday and I'll show you.

08:09.053 --> 08:10.490
Thank you.

08:24.329 --> 08:26.767
Don't worry,
I've got him. So sorry.

08:26.810 --> 08:29.465
-There you are.
-You must have tea on.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.989
-Where have you been?
-I took him to the sweet shop,

08:32.033 --> 08:34.731
and his shirt got all sticky,
so I got another one.

08:34.775 --> 08:36.602
What's happened?

08:36.645 --> 08:38.953
-I tripped over a stone.
-Oh.

08:38.996 --> 08:40.258
Are you all right?

08:41.738 --> 08:43.740
Oh, let's get you changed.
Thank you, Annie.

08:43.784 --> 08:46.308
-All right.
Do you want me to stay?
-Uh, no.

08:49.093 --> 08:50.878
Let's get a shirt on.

08:58.929 --> 09:02.280
Got to be careful
this time of year. Make sure
they don't swarm.

09:04.456 --> 09:06.981
If the colony gets too big,

09:07.024 --> 09:10.158
some of the bees leave
to find a new home.

09:10.201 --> 09:11.812
Look. There's honey.

09:11.855 --> 09:14.597
-Where do they go?
- Anywhere.

09:14.641 --> 09:16.686
Somewhere dark and warm.

09:16.730 --> 09:20.516
-I found them in the
chimney once.
- Look at this.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.606
- She likes you.
-She's a girl?

09:23.650 --> 09:26.261
Most of the bees
you'll ever see are girls.

09:29.177 --> 09:32.920
You know my father used to say
you should tell the bees your
secrets,

09:32.963 --> 09:34.704
then they don't fly away.

09:34.748 --> 09:37.185
Do you tell the bees your
secrets?

09:37.228 --> 09:39.013
I used to.

09:39.056 --> 09:42.843
-Did it work?
-Well, they're still here.

09:42.886 --> 09:45.019
Maybe they remember.

09:49.850 --> 09:52.592
Why'd you leave home?

09:52.635 --> 09:56.639
-I went away to
boarding school.
-Then why did you come back?

09:59.860 --> 10:04.038
I wanted to come home again,
and the bees were going to die
without me.

10:05.474 --> 10:06.649
Here.

10:08.259 --> 10:10.653
You can take down what
you observe.

10:10.697 --> 10:14.265
Changes in the weather, where
the flowers are growing best,

10:14.309 --> 10:17.094
anything that might be
significant.

10:17.138 --> 10:20.315
-Is that what you do?
-Well, doctors have to.

10:20.358 --> 10:22.665
We observe and we listen.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.407
If you listen carefully enough,

10:25.450 --> 10:28.540
you can understand people
even when they don't speak.

10:28.584 --> 10:30.151
Same with the bees.

10:53.261 --> 10:55.393
My mum is sad.

10:58.527 --> 11:00.050
I don't know what to do.

11:08.189 --> 11:09.756
Mr Weekes?

11:10.757 --> 11:12.933
Mrs Weekes? The rent's overdue,

11:12.976 --> 11:14.499
still.

11:25.380 --> 11:28.122
Mrs Weekes, this is your last
warning.

12:04.985 --> 12:07.291
-Why don't you go out for a
dance, Mum?
-Oh.

12:10.164 --> 12:11.905
I'd rather dance with you.

12:30.097 --> 12:31.881
-Come on, Mum.
-Go on.

12:57.298 --> 12:59.430
These aren't from the library,
Charlie.

12:59.474 --> 13:01.781
The new doctor gave me a
present.

13:23.977 --> 13:25.500
Can I help you?

13:25.543 --> 13:27.502
I'd like to speak to
the doctor, please.

13:27.545 --> 13:30.635
And I'd like to ask him why he's
inviting a ten-year-old to his
house,

13:30.679 --> 13:33.769
and bribing him to come back
with these.

13:35.075 --> 13:38.556
-Heidi?
-Yes, with Heidi.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.558
Mum!

13:40.602 --> 13:43.561
-Are you expecting
the doctor home?
-Hello, Dr. Markham.

13:43.605 --> 13:44.998
Hello, Charlie.

13:46.782 --> 13:48.436
Oh.

13:48.479 --> 13:51.047
Charlie wanted to see the bees.
Bribes were not discussed.

13:51.091 --> 13:55.443
-Oh... I didn't think...
-You said you liked Heidi,Mum.

13:55.486 --> 13:57.532
Oh, I do. The film.

13:57.575 --> 13:59.795
-Shirley Temple?
-The dancing.

14:03.930 --> 14:07.237
-Oh, my shoes don't match.
-No, they don't.

14:14.201 --> 14:16.464
I'm sorry
if he's been a nuisance.

14:16.507 --> 14:17.726
He hasn't.

14:18.596 --> 14:19.859
He can come any time.

14:23.645 --> 14:26.082
He's telling them secrets.

14:26.126 --> 14:28.650
He never used to keep things
from me.

14:32.959 --> 14:36.223
"Hide from your neighbors
as much as you please,

14:36.266 --> 14:39.922
but everything that happens
you must tell the bees."

14:39.966 --> 14:43.012
Something like that.
That's Kipling, isn't it?

14:43.056 --> 14:45.580
I thought it was a local
superstition.

14:45.623 --> 14:49.323
Oh, there's plenty of those.

14:49.366 --> 14:52.282
The bees actually do start
to recognize voices.

14:52.326 --> 14:54.458
And footsteps sometimes.

14:54.502 --> 14:56.547
-The vibrations.
-Huh.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.900
I'm sorry, I don't have any
spoons.

15:00.943 --> 15:04.381
My father auctioned almost
everything before he died.

15:04.425 --> 15:07.167
He expected you
to live here without spoons?

15:07.210 --> 15:09.691
He expected me to sell the
house.

15:09.734 --> 15:12.781
Probably would be
the sensible thing to do.

15:12.824 --> 15:16.219
He'd be proud though, no, if
you'd taken over his practice?

15:17.525 --> 15:20.397
-I think he'd be surprised.
-Yes.

15:20.441 --> 15:23.835
Dunloth might take a while
getting used to a lady doctor.

15:23.879 --> 15:25.881
It's a little modern for them.

15:28.579 --> 15:30.407
I like that about it.

15:30.451 --> 15:34.150
This town has always seemed...
outside of time to me.

15:34.194 --> 15:39.155
Like Tam o' Shanter might sit on
the bus stop alongside the
millworkers.

15:42.289 --> 15:44.030
I can't say I've noticed.

15:45.814 --> 15:49.470
-You're not from Dunloth.
-No, I'm from near Manchester.

15:49.513 --> 15:54.823
My father and Rob, that's
Charlie's dad, didn't... see eye
to eye.

15:54.866 --> 15:57.608
So, when I found out
I was having Charlie,

15:57.652 --> 15:59.175
we moved to Rob's people.

16:02.483 --> 16:04.093
And then he went back
to the war.

16:06.791 --> 16:08.619
He left me here,
with my different voice

16:08.663 --> 16:12.188
and a baby older than my
marriage.

16:12.232 --> 16:15.322
When he came, back he'd changed,

16:15.365 --> 16:17.454
as though he never really
came home.

16:17.498 --> 16:21.067
No one spoke to me except
Charlie. Sorry.

16:29.075 --> 16:30.511
Sometimes it feels like...

16:32.774 --> 16:34.732
..I'm separated from everything.

16:35.690 --> 16:37.518
Even Charlie.

16:39.389 --> 16:41.000
Do you know that feeling?

16:44.133 --> 16:46.962
Mum!
They recognize me!

16:59.540 --> 17:00.802
She laughed.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.285
Did you do that?

17:07.635 --> 17:09.202
Well, we better go.

17:09.854 --> 17:11.247
Thank you.

17:13.684 --> 17:15.512
You're welcome.

17:17.426 --> 17:19.038
Both of you.

17:27.133 --> 17:30.049
You know you can always
tell me things.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.792
If you promise to always
tell the truth,

17:34.836 --> 17:37.795
I promise I'll always
believe you.

17:39.014 --> 17:41.234
Will you always tell me
the truth?

17:42.365 --> 17:43.497
Yes.

17:44.628 --> 17:45.847
Promise.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.115
Can I visit the bees again?

17:54.073 --> 17:55.378
Yes.

17:56.162 --> 17:57.424
Yeah, you can.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.978
Rob's stopped paying the rent.

19:15.023 --> 19:17.199
You know where to find him.

19:17.243 --> 19:19.897
You think
she'd open the door to me?

19:22.683 --> 19:25.555
Can I get a few more hours?
Just a few?

19:25.599 --> 19:28.210
We've got more girls than
hours as it is.

19:32.693 --> 19:36.349
What was my brother thinking of
bringing back a wild one like
you?

19:41.919 --> 19:45.184
Break's over.
Back to work now.

20:02.070 --> 20:05.552
Not too high.
I've seen measles much worse.

20:05.595 --> 20:07.641
I'll check on him in a few days.

20:08.990 --> 20:11.210
It's good for him to have had it
at his age.

20:13.037 --> 20:15.301
Might be better if your wee girl
stays away though.

20:16.824 --> 20:18.391
Off you go, Connie.

20:20.306 --> 20:21.437
I remember you.

20:23.918 --> 20:27.182
-Do you?
-Yes. From school.

20:29.532 --> 20:32.318
I don't need advice from you on
how to look after my daughter.

20:34.494 --> 20:35.625
Of course.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.214
You don't have
to go to her house.

20:59.258 --> 21:02.391
You could try the pub.
Or the dogs.

21:04.001 --> 21:06.961
He'll turn up somewhere.

21:07.004 --> 21:09.572
Mum said the war made it
so he can't stay still.

21:10.573 --> 21:11.705
Sorry.

21:15.230 --> 21:17.450
You can find someone else
any time you like.

21:17.493 --> 21:19.452
-Hmph.
-You're pretty enough.

21:19.495 --> 21:22.498
Yeah. Men round here
see Rob ten paces behind me

21:22.542 --> 21:24.631
-even when he's off work
or in town.

21:25.458 --> 21:28.112
Is that George?

21:28.156 --> 21:31.681
-Yeah.
-Should you really be meeting
him here?

21:31.725 --> 21:34.728
If she asks, say I was with
you. Come on.

21:34.771 --> 21:38.297
-Come on.
-Go on. Be careful.

21:53.268 --> 21:54.965
Hello.

21:55.009 --> 21:56.924
Charlie said he'd bring those
next time he visited.

21:56.967 --> 21:58.752
Oh, I was passing after work,
so...

21:58.795 --> 22:02.538
-From the mill?
-Oh, I went the long way
round.

22:02.582 --> 22:04.148
-I have to...
-How are the bees?

22:04.192 --> 22:06.716
Oh. They're fine, thank you.

22:09.676 --> 22:11.025
Rob's left us.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.463
It's been happening gradually.
I...

22:17.597 --> 22:21.427
My pay won't even cover the
rent, and...

22:21.470 --> 22:26.519
..I keep thinking I should just
take Charlie and pack a bag and
leave, but...

22:26.562 --> 22:30.392
..train fare past Stirling's
beyond me currently.

22:30.436 --> 22:33.656
-Do you need money?
-No, no, that's not...
I, umm...

22:33.700 --> 22:36.572
I've written to my father.
He'll help.

22:36.616 --> 22:39.270
I just... wanted to tell you.

22:42.404 --> 22:45.625
Sorry. Perhaps I've caught you
at a bad time.

22:46.626 --> 22:47.931
Thank you for the books.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.339
So this is how you say
goodbye now?

23:56.826 --> 23:58.959
The last of your things?

24:09.186 --> 24:11.188
Charlie was playing
with it.

24:12.363 --> 24:14.322
It's not a toy.

24:15.018 --> 24:16.803
He misses you.

24:16.846 --> 24:19.022
He's all right.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.529
Do you remember, Robbie?

25:07.767 --> 25:10.291
You're like no one
I've ever met.

25:10.334 --> 25:12.162
Give me a proper goodbye, then.

25:16.993 --> 25:18.908
We're gonna be evicted.

25:22.564 --> 25:25.001
You have to learn
to look after yourself.

25:27.743 --> 25:29.919
And that boy of yours.

25:29.963 --> 25:31.399
No, ours.

25:32.487 --> 25:34.010
-Don't talk clever.
-Oh.

25:41.496 --> 25:43.585
-It's what you always do.

25:44.499 --> 25:46.109
Make things difficult.

25:49.417 --> 25:51.245
-Robbie?

25:51.288 --> 25:55.423
-Robbie, we're your family.

26:10.046 --> 26:12.527
So you say you've had this pain
since your son was born.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.703
-Yes, that's right.
-How long ago was that?

26:14.747 --> 26:17.097
Thomas will be ten on Tuesday.

26:18.925 --> 26:21.797
-You know it doesn't
cost any more.
-Yes.

26:24.147 --> 26:26.497
You didn't want to ask my
father about this.

26:33.853 --> 26:34.984
Next?

26:36.290 --> 26:38.509
The promise we made was
medicine for all

26:38.553 --> 26:40.947
and now we're charging
for prescriptions.

26:40.990 --> 26:44.037
Jean, I'm a solicitor.

26:44.080 --> 26:47.344
I charge people
just to sit in my office.

26:47.388 --> 26:53.176
So, she carried on going into
work, the girl with the throat
infection?

26:53.220 --> 26:54.787
They do, these women.

26:54.830 --> 26:57.703
They work and they keep quiet

26:57.746 --> 26:59.574
and they don't complain.

27:01.315 --> 27:03.534
I think I could make a
difference there.

27:03.578 --> 27:06.450
Mmm. Have you got any help for
yourself?

27:06.494 --> 27:10.019
No. I think it'd be odd
to have a stranger in the
house.

27:10.063 --> 27:13.632
-Worried they'll learn your
secrets?

27:14.328 --> 27:16.156
What about you?

27:16.199 --> 27:17.940
Sarah's sister's been helping.
She...

27:22.945 --> 27:24.643
She looks just like Sarah.

27:26.775 --> 27:31.301
After Mum, my father never
bought the soap she used ever
again.

27:33.129 --> 27:35.262
Silly old me.

27:37.699 --> 27:39.962
I'm sorry I wasn't here
for the funeral.

27:43.966 --> 27:47.317
-We... We don't have
to be alone.
-Jim.

27:48.536 --> 27:51.626
We could sit together and...

27:51.670 --> 27:55.282
..complain about the state of
British politics until one of
us dies.

27:57.632 --> 27:59.808
I think we'd be happy.

27:59.852 --> 28:01.288
We would.

28:03.246 --> 28:04.683
Will you think about it?

28:27.227 --> 28:30.273
Charlie, I'm going.
Your sandwich is on the side.

29:29.376 --> 29:31.334
- Annie!

29:31.378 --> 29:33.032
My scissors. My scissors!

29:33.075 --> 29:35.208
Get it out. Be careful!

29:36.600 --> 29:38.777
Get it out!

29:38.820 --> 29:40.996
-What's going on?

29:41.040 --> 29:43.172
Out of the way.

29:43.999 --> 29:45.131
Ruined.

29:45.174 --> 29:47.481
Bloody women!

29:47.524 --> 29:50.571
Lydia, you know how he gets
in the afternoons.

29:50.614 --> 29:52.921
Calm down. Just talk to him.

29:52.965 --> 29:55.141
Oh! Sodding mills.

29:55.184 --> 29:58.492
-I hate them.
-I know, but...

29:58.535 --> 29:59.710
Annie!

29:59.754 --> 30:00.973
-What?
-Get back here now.

30:45.539 --> 30:47.454
Huh.

30:57.333 --> 30:58.726
Fuck him.

31:05.776 --> 31:08.518
Hello, Mrs Bewick.
I'm sorry, it's been a few
days...

31:10.216 --> 31:12.348
It's Connie, she...

31:14.655 --> 31:18.441
I tried to keep her away.
We've only got one room.

31:35.545 --> 31:36.851
Mum?

31:42.509 --> 31:43.640
Mum!

33:19.084 --> 33:20.302
Excuse me.

33:21.738 --> 33:23.044
Charlie!

33:23.088 --> 33:26.047
Charlie, wait.
What are you doin'?

33:26.091 --> 33:28.136
I was looking for you.

33:28.180 --> 33:30.530
You can't go running around the
streets like that.

33:30.573 --> 33:32.749
What were you doing?
- Nothing.

33:32.793 --> 33:34.447
That's not the truth.

33:38.016 --> 33:39.669
Are you all right?

33:39.713 --> 33:41.062
Can I drive you home?

33:56.425 --> 33:59.080
I was sacked.

33:59.124 --> 34:01.865
So I had a drink.

34:01.909 --> 34:04.085
Danced with a man
whose name I didn't ask.

34:06.827 --> 34:08.393
You must think I'm awful.

34:09.699 --> 34:12.050
I don't.

34:12.092 --> 34:14.878
-The other day, you were
so cold.
-I'm sorry.

34:14.922 --> 34:17.141
-I thought that we...
- It's nothing you did.

34:26.411 --> 34:28.370
What's wrong?

34:33.505 --> 34:35.594
A little girl died today.

34:36.291 --> 34:37.466
Oh.

34:39.120 --> 34:40.817
If I'd visited earlier,

34:41.992 --> 34:44.995
if she'd... called me...

34:48.303 --> 34:50.436
I should've just gone.

35:09.759 --> 35:10.891
Come on.

35:17.593 --> 35:18.942
Mum!

35:18.986 --> 35:20.988
Now what?

35:21.641 --> 35:23.991
Oh, God.

35:28.213 --> 35:30.519
We've been evicted.

35:59.592 --> 36:02.508
The last housekeeper
left just after my father died.

36:03.726 --> 36:05.815
And... do we eat with you?

36:05.859 --> 36:07.687
Oh.

36:07.730 --> 36:09.341
Of course.

36:19.525 --> 36:22.005
So, this could be your room.

36:23.616 --> 36:26.575
Sorry, it's a bit...

36:26.619 --> 36:29.187
No one's slept in here
in about 20 years.

36:33.756 --> 36:36.716
- Where are you?
- Just downstairs.

36:36.759 --> 36:38.500
I thought I'd put Charlie
in here.

36:44.767 --> 36:49.555
This used to be my bed. It
probably won't survive being
jumped on.

36:49.598 --> 36:52.122
Do I seem like the kind of
person who might jump on a bed?

36:56.126 --> 36:57.911
-A little.

37:06.833 --> 37:09.531
Bees have five eyes
and one spit of bone.

37:09.575 --> 37:12.404
And at the back of their
abdomen is the stinger.

37:13.492 --> 37:15.537
Unlike the rest of the bees,

37:15.581 --> 37:18.932
the queen bee does not die
when she stings

37:18.975 --> 37:20.977
and her body is twice as large,

37:22.022 --> 37:24.198
her life 30 times longer.

37:31.510 --> 37:33.207
Oof!

37:33.251 --> 37:35.035
The queen doesn't rule
the hive.

37:35.078 --> 37:37.690
No one does.

37:37.733 --> 37:40.258
Everything's decided
in harmony,

37:40.301 --> 37:44.697
except they don't use words.
They dance.

37:44.740 --> 37:48.178
If you pay attention, they're
talking to us all the time.

37:48.831 --> 37:50.268
Next.

37:52.400 --> 37:54.837
Please take a seat.

37:54.881 --> 37:58.276
Dr. Markham says if a
beekeeper's worried the hive
wants to swarm,

37:58.319 --> 38:02.280
they can calm the bees by
tapping and the bees will
answer by humming.

38:27.696 --> 38:32.048
Without bees, there would be
no flowers and no fruit,

38:32.092 --> 38:37.315
and all we would have
are enormous fields of grass.

38:37.358 --> 38:42.755
Dr. Markham says when all the
honey bees die, the world will
end.

38:49.979 --> 38:52.068
Fly over to the purple flower.

39:14.961 --> 39:19.139
-Dr. Markham, dance with us.
-No, no. No.

39:19.182 --> 39:21.315
Come on.

39:28.931 --> 39:31.412
Come on, move your feet.

39:31.456 --> 39:33.240
Charlie.

39:33.283 --> 39:35.242
It's fine how you're doing it.

39:36.504 --> 39:38.332
Maybe lots of...

39:50.997 --> 39:53.434
And back.

39:53.478 --> 39:55.349
And back.

39:55.393 --> 39:56.481
Yes.

39:58.961 --> 40:01.137
Back. Yes.

40:01.790 --> 40:03.096
Just like that.

40:05.664 --> 40:08.144
A bike?

40:08.188 --> 40:09.363
-Oh.

40:18.154 --> 40:20.374
You didn't?

40:20.418 --> 40:22.724
Mr Wells was going to throw
it away.

40:23.638 --> 40:25.640
It just needed a bit of oil.

40:25.684 --> 40:27.033
I can't...

40:28.338 --> 40:30.123
Thank you.

40:32.386 --> 40:33.518
Thank you.

40:46.705 --> 40:50.883
I used to go out every
Saturday, even after Charlie.

40:50.926 --> 40:54.234
I'd dance until my shoes wore
out.

40:54.277 --> 40:56.062
And then I'd dance barefoot.

40:57.106 --> 40:59.021
How do you manage to be so...

41:00.022 --> 41:01.937
...yourself?

41:03.939 --> 41:05.201
Do I?

41:06.115 --> 41:08.248
You can't help it.

41:09.554 --> 41:10.990
Mum!

41:12.513 --> 41:14.167
Uh-oh.

41:14.210 --> 41:17.300
Charlie. Charlie, we'll just
have to leave it.

41:20.608 --> 41:21.957
Oh...

41:25.526 --> 41:27.093
What are you doing?

41:30.836 --> 41:33.926
Jean, be careful.

41:33.969 --> 41:35.580
It's freezing.

41:40.933 --> 41:42.978
Dr. Markham!

42:00.430 --> 42:01.562
Yay!

42:19.406 --> 42:21.190
You must be freezing.

42:27.762 --> 42:29.068
Thanks, Lydia.

42:30.156 --> 42:31.549
I'll get you some tea.

42:36.249 --> 42:37.816
What do you say, Charlie?

42:37.859 --> 42:40.383
-Thank you.
- You're welcome.

42:41.471 --> 42:43.561
Thank you.

43:03.929 --> 43:06.671
Do you have a husband?

43:06.714 --> 43:08.977
You know she doesn't, Charlie.

43:19.988 --> 43:22.077
It's scandalous
what they put back on shelves.

43:23.470 --> 43:25.559
Dr. Markham's got you scrubbing
floors.

43:25.603 --> 43:27.213
I'm busy, Pam.

43:27.256 --> 43:29.650
Careful to stay respectable,

43:29.694 --> 43:32.653
or Robert will have something to
say about where his son is.

43:32.697 --> 43:34.655
Dr. Markham's given us a home.

43:34.699 --> 43:37.440
-Your brother got us
thrown out.
-You know what she is? She's...

43:41.053 --> 43:42.184
She's made up wrong.

43:44.186 --> 43:46.624
There was rumors about
an incident.

43:47.668 --> 43:49.714
With another girl.

43:51.193 --> 43:53.761
Wait, what do...?

43:53.805 --> 43:55.154
Pam, what do you...?

44:04.119 --> 44:06.121
Quick! Quick! In the foxhole!

44:06.165 --> 44:08.254
There's a bomber comin'!

44:08.297 --> 44:10.038
Bang, bang, bang, bang!

44:11.387 --> 44:12.737
Boom!

44:13.651 --> 44:15.696
What is that?

44:15.740 --> 44:17.002
What is it?

44:17.045 --> 44:18.960
I don't know.

44:19.004 --> 44:20.701
Well, anyway, you can have it.

44:20.745 --> 44:23.835
-No, I'm not having it.
-Yeah.

44:23.878 --> 44:27.360
Nope, I'm not having it.
I don't even know where it's
been.

44:27.403 --> 44:28.883
I wonder what it is.

44:29.405 --> 44:31.277
Ooh.

44:31.320 --> 44:33.105
Is it...?

44:33.148 --> 44:36.151
-Ooh!

44:36.195 --> 44:39.894
My mum said
sweethearts come here to kiss.

44:41.809 --> 44:44.246
So, is Dr. Markham
your mum's best friend?

44:44.290 --> 44:46.858
No. Dr. Markham's my friend.

44:46.901 --> 44:48.903
Does she have a bath in
her house?

44:48.947 --> 44:51.079
Yeah. It's a big one.

44:51.123 --> 44:52.864
It's even fixed to the floor.

44:52.907 --> 44:56.519
My mum said she was a dirty dyke
when she was young.

44:59.653 --> 45:01.133
Come on.

45:09.489 --> 45:11.621
Go away.

45:13.406 --> 45:14.886
Oi!

45:16.844 --> 45:18.106
Oi, oi, get off.

45:18.150 --> 45:20.761
Oh, oh, oh! Get off!

45:20.805 --> 45:24.373
Oh, it's on me! Get it off me!
Jean, get it off me.

45:24.417 --> 45:26.724
-Get it off me.
-Stay still.

45:26.767 --> 45:28.682
-Stay still.

45:28.726 --> 45:30.815
Shh. Shh...

45:46.744 --> 45:47.832
No.

45:49.050 --> 45:51.183
We mustn't.

45:56.536 --> 45:58.799
What did you do to
the bees?

45:58.843 --> 46:00.409
No, nothing. I, umm... I...

47:58.571 --> 48:01.443
I'll wear my sister's dress
but taken in. I'm smaller in the
waist.

48:14.326 --> 48:17.111
Three tiers high
and as sweet as when we were
little.

48:17.155 --> 48:19.722
-Mam may be hiding her
sugar rations.
- You're late.

48:19.766 --> 48:23.030
We've got 25 ounces now. He's
gonna give us a proper place to
live as well soon.

48:23.074 --> 48:25.598
We haven't set a date for the
wedding yet, have we, Robbie?

48:25.641 --> 48:27.905
Wants everything yesterday,
this one.

48:28.775 --> 48:30.908
Who gave you away, Pam?

48:30.951 --> 48:33.127
Your parents were dead,
weren't they?

48:35.086 --> 48:37.131
That's right, yes.

48:38.654 --> 48:41.048
You did a fine job bringing
this one up.

48:41.092 --> 48:42.832
Aye, she did.

48:42.876 --> 48:44.225
We managed.

48:49.927 --> 48:52.016
I saw Lydia in town.

48:52.886 --> 48:53.974
She's got a job now.

48:54.018 --> 48:55.976
Charwoman to that lady doctor.

48:56.020 --> 48:57.412
Housekeeper.

48:58.674 --> 48:59.980
Respectable.

49:02.374 --> 49:04.245
She looked well.

49:04.289 --> 49:07.814
Charlie's loving it too.
He's taking care of the bees.

49:07.857 --> 49:11.165
I wouldn't be surprised if she's
got someone looking after her
now, too.

49:35.363 --> 49:37.191
- Lydia!

49:50.726 --> 49:52.032
It's nice.

49:52.076 --> 49:53.773
What are you doing here?

49:53.816 --> 49:56.210
A job the only new thing you
got?

50:00.432 --> 50:03.522
-I think you'd better go home.
-You've got someone then?

50:05.176 --> 50:07.743
- Do you care?
- Of course I do.

50:09.093 --> 50:10.659
Charlie's my son.

50:10.703 --> 50:13.184
He needs me to teach him
how to be a man.

50:18.841 --> 50:20.974
You might need me too.

50:22.019 --> 50:23.803
What about her?

50:24.499 --> 50:25.979
She's not you.

50:31.724 --> 50:33.378
Don't you want me back?

50:35.206 --> 50:36.990
I never wanted
you to go.

50:42.778 --> 50:43.953
No.

50:51.831 --> 50:53.311
I can take Charlie...

50:54.181 --> 50:56.314
..any time I want.

51:31.653 --> 51:32.828
Do you have someone?

51:34.308 --> 51:35.440
Uh...

51:38.095 --> 51:39.400
I have you.

51:47.147 --> 51:48.235
Night-night.

51:50.237 --> 51:51.934
Sleep tight.

55:24.321 --> 55:26.105
Mmm...

55:26.148 --> 55:28.237
You talk in your sleep.

55:29.195 --> 55:31.110
Do I?

55:31.153 --> 55:32.503
-Hmm.
-What did I say?

55:35.941 --> 55:37.421
I don't know that I should say.

55:38.900 --> 55:40.032
What?

55:41.033 --> 55:43.514
You listed types of penicillin.

55:44.776 --> 55:48.257
I only have very dull secrets.

55:48.301 --> 55:49.868
That's not true.

56:06.058 --> 56:07.842
Did you always know?

56:14.458 --> 56:16.590
I loved someone.

56:18.636 --> 56:19.767
Rose.

56:21.639 --> 56:24.032
I suppose I didn't have those
words.

56:26.034 --> 56:27.949
But that's what it was.

56:29.386 --> 56:31.213
We used to walk to that loch.

56:37.785 --> 56:41.093
There were some... boys.

56:54.062 --> 56:56.238
Rose was badly hurt.

57:03.594 --> 57:05.204
After that...

57:06.553 --> 57:08.555
...my father felt that
I couldn't stay.

57:10.078 --> 57:13.255
He said this town
was too small for secrets.

57:15.823 --> 57:17.912
So I left.

57:20.480 --> 57:23.614
I never stayed anywhere long
enough for people to know me.

57:28.445 --> 57:31.448
But secrets find a way out
in big towns, too.

57:33.319 --> 57:35.103
Then my father died.

57:35.930 --> 57:37.541
And there was his house.

57:39.281 --> 57:42.676
And they needed a doctor here.

57:42.720 --> 57:45.940
And I suppose I wanted to stop
running.

57:48.769 --> 57:50.902
To do some good here this time.

58:15.709 --> 58:17.102
Oh!

58:18.669 --> 58:20.148
Shit!

58:37.601 --> 58:39.690
It recognizes you.

58:39.733 --> 58:42.214
How could a bee recognize you?

58:42.867 --> 58:44.999
Not it, she.

58:47.436 --> 58:49.700
-Do women ever kiss each other?
-Huh.

58:52.659 --> 58:53.791
Shh.

59:16.117 --> 59:18.250
Charlie?

59:23.690 --> 59:25.953
-Has Charlie been past?
-No, I haven't seen him.

59:25.997 --> 59:28.173
-Sorry about that.
-He's probably just playing.

59:28.216 --> 59:31.263
I just want to know where he is.
Sorry.

59:31.785 --> 59:32.960
Hmph.

59:35.876 --> 59:37.008
Lydia?

59:38.879 --> 59:41.490
Charlie! There you are.

59:41.534 --> 59:44.668
You weren't back for your
dinner. You must be starving
hungry.

59:44.711 --> 59:46.147
Are you OK?

59:47.627 --> 59:50.412
Are you all right? What's wrong?

59:52.066 --> 59:54.939
You've not been scrapping again,
have you?

59:58.029 --> 01:00:00.118
George touched her...

01:00:01.685 --> 01:00:02.947
...down there.

01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:07.604
Why would she want him to
do that?

01:00:16.047 --> 01:00:18.223
-Sorry, Jim. Thanks.
- All right.

01:00:18.832 --> 01:00:20.486
Thank you.

01:00:21.705 --> 01:00:23.881
All right. Here you go.

01:00:29.016 --> 01:00:32.541
- There we go.
-Thank you.

01:00:35.414 --> 01:00:37.721
And there you go.

01:00:37.764 --> 01:00:39.461
Thank you.

01:01:37.476 --> 01:01:41.132
Oh, no, my love,
I can't dance like you.

01:01:43.482 --> 01:01:45.527
- No!

01:01:51.969 --> 01:01:54.145
Uh, I, umm, better clear up.

01:02:07.375 --> 01:02:10.683
I should take
Meg home.

01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:16.210
We've...
We've become very close.

01:02:19.126 --> 01:02:21.781
It's a small town, Jean.

01:02:21.825 --> 01:02:23.914
No one knows anything.

01:02:23.957 --> 01:02:26.481
-Her husband's left her.
-He's still her husband.

01:02:26.525 --> 01:02:30.790
The law is entirely on his side.
He could take Charlie away.

01:02:30.834 --> 01:02:33.358
Does Lydia know that?

01:02:33.401 --> 01:02:34.838
What does Charlie know?

01:02:35.926 --> 01:02:38.058
-Nothing.
-That's good.

01:02:42.671 --> 01:02:46.197
There... There was a time...

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:48.808
..when I would have given
anything for you to look at me

01:02:48.852 --> 01:02:50.549
the way you looked at her.

01:02:54.335 --> 01:02:55.859
Wouldn't it have been easier?

01:02:59.079 --> 01:03:00.559
I'm sorry.

01:03:02.213 --> 01:03:04.084
We'll see you and Meg again
soon?

01:03:05.433 --> 01:03:06.783
Yes, yes.

01:03:09.524 --> 01:03:10.917
Of course.

01:03:12.876 --> 01:03:15.139
This is irresponsible, Jean.

01:03:26.237 --> 01:03:28.848
Meg's sound asleep.

01:03:28.892 --> 01:03:30.850
I'm gonna take her home.
But thank you.

01:03:30.894 --> 01:03:33.287
- Thank you.
- We'll see ourselves out.

01:03:33.331 --> 01:03:34.767
Goodbye.

01:03:47.127 --> 01:03:50.174
It'll be all right. I promise.

01:04:25.905 --> 01:04:28.212
Oh. Can't sleep?

01:04:32.999 --> 01:04:34.740
Is someone gonna take me away?

01:04:36.785 --> 01:04:38.309
Why would you think that?

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:42.704
Charlie, why would you think
that?

01:04:48.623 --> 01:04:50.147
I don't know.

01:04:57.110 --> 01:04:58.372
Night.

01:05:33.494 --> 01:05:35.714
We have so much time to decide.

01:05:38.891 --> 01:05:42.155
-So why didn't you tell me
earlier?
-I don't know.

01:05:42.199 --> 01:05:44.244
I didn't know about it.

01:06:05.135 --> 01:06:09.139
-Shameful. And with the doctor.
-I know.

01:06:12.881 --> 01:06:14.666
- Oh, Mum.
-Charlie.

01:06:16.450 --> 01:06:20.106
-Have you said something?
-About what?

01:06:21.803 --> 01:06:23.196
Please don't lie to me.

01:06:24.328 --> 01:06:25.720
I'm not lying.

01:06:27.679 --> 01:06:30.160
Remember, I promised
to always tell the truth.

01:06:30.203 --> 01:06:33.250
Yeah, I know. Sorry.

01:06:39.952 --> 01:06:42.085
All right, Charlie.

01:06:42.128 --> 01:06:44.739
Well! What, no cuddle?

01:06:44.783 --> 01:06:46.393
Come here.

01:06:46.437 --> 01:06:49.048
-Hi.

01:06:49.092 --> 01:06:51.137
- How are you?
-I'm good.

01:06:51.181 --> 01:06:53.052
-This is so nice.
-I know.

01:06:53.096 --> 01:06:54.140
Wow.

01:06:54.184 --> 01:06:55.620
-Come in.
-Thanks.

01:06:57.361 --> 01:06:59.972
I have been on my feet all day.

01:07:01.669 --> 01:07:04.846
George says I need
to take care of myself.

01:07:04.890 --> 01:07:07.588
-Oh.
-He's getting a job in a hotel.

01:07:07.632 --> 01:07:09.068
-Oh.
-Hm-hmm.

01:07:14.987 --> 01:07:16.771
You won't rush things, will you?

01:07:16.815 --> 01:07:18.425
Well...

01:07:19.992 --> 01:07:21.559
Umm...

01:07:24.301 --> 01:07:25.693
Hm-hmm.

01:07:26.781 --> 01:07:27.913
Yeah.

01:07:29.045 --> 01:07:31.003
Oh.

01:07:31.047 --> 01:07:32.874
-I see.
-Yeah. We'll be fine.

01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:37.096
You don't know that, though.

01:07:38.358 --> 01:07:39.490
I didn't.

01:07:41.318 --> 01:07:42.580
I do.

01:07:47.672 --> 01:07:52.633
He makes me feel like I can have
whatever life I want.

01:07:55.158 --> 01:07:58.248
You know what I mean?

01:07:58.291 --> 01:08:01.773
- Hmm.
-You do, don't you?

01:08:01.816 --> 01:08:03.122
Hmm.

01:08:05.081 --> 01:08:06.256
Yeah.

01:08:07.431 --> 01:08:08.867
Yeah, I do.

01:08:59.265 --> 01:09:01.136
-Mum?
- Charlie.

01:09:03.225 --> 01:09:04.575
Charlie?

01:09:06.751 --> 01:09:08.535
Charlie.

01:09:08.578 --> 01:09:11.103
Love, did you see something just
then? Shall we talk about it?

01:09:11.147 --> 01:09:12.844
Stop talking.

01:09:12.886 --> 01:09:15.542
-Charlie, please.
- Stop it!

01:09:15.586 --> 01:09:17.501
- Let's...
-Stop it!

01:09:17.544 --> 01:09:20.546
You promised to tell me the
truth!

01:09:20.591 --> 01:09:24.160
You're always keeping secrets
and leaving me out!

01:09:25.029 --> 01:09:26.684
You're dirty dykes!

01:09:55.930 --> 01:09:57.410
I don't know what to tell him.

01:09:59.238 --> 01:10:00.761
I'm so sorry.

01:10:01.284 --> 01:10:02.720
I...

01:10:05.288 --> 01:10:07.028
How do we explain?

01:10:08.334 --> 01:10:12.295
He has to understand
that he must keep quiet.

01:10:12.338 --> 01:10:14.688
Is that what you're worried
about?

01:10:14.732 --> 01:10:18.039
-If he tells anyone...
-He starts school next week.

01:10:18.083 --> 01:10:20.303
You can't make a ten-year-old
keep a secret.

01:10:20.346 --> 01:10:22.261
Then what are we going to do?

01:10:30.574 --> 01:10:32.793
I want this.

01:10:32.837 --> 01:10:37.015
Remember that...
in the next few days and weeks.

01:10:39.583 --> 01:10:41.846
Try hard to remember that.

01:11:59.619 --> 01:12:01.752
Is Dad here?

01:12:04.624 --> 01:12:06.234
Come on upstairs.

01:12:07.410 --> 01:12:08.759
Come on.

01:12:17.158 --> 01:12:19.639
- Charlie?

01:12:19.683 --> 01:12:21.815
He's not in the house.

01:12:22.903 --> 01:12:23.991
His bike's gone.

01:12:24.949 --> 01:12:26.733
-Can we...?
-Yes.

01:12:30.215 --> 01:12:33.436
Mum and Dr. Markham
kiss on the mouths.

01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:38.266
I saw them.

01:12:40.268 --> 01:12:42.227
They kiss each other all over.

01:12:43.707 --> 01:12:44.751
What?

01:12:47.101 --> 01:12:49.234
She touched her.

01:12:50.366 --> 01:12:51.802
-Down there.
-Oh, Jesus!

01:12:51.845 --> 01:12:53.630
-Rob...
-Christ!

01:13:00.201 --> 01:13:02.334
You saw this, Charlie?

01:13:03.379 --> 01:13:05.337
Will I be taken away?

01:13:05.381 --> 01:13:07.034
What?

01:13:08.035 --> 01:13:09.907
Am I going to be taken away?

01:13:12.518 --> 01:13:13.650
No.

01:13:14.738 --> 01:13:16.653
No, no, no.

01:13:19.307 --> 01:13:20.831
Not while I'm around.

01:13:22.441 --> 01:13:24.225
And where's he gonna go?

01:13:24.269 --> 01:13:26.010
There's no room at mine.

01:13:26.837 --> 01:13:28.708
He'll stay here for now.

01:13:28.752 --> 01:13:31.450
What if she comes looking for
him? Am I to deal with that, am
I?

01:13:31.494 --> 01:13:33.757
-Of course not.
-He's your son, Robert.

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:36.542
-You're to see he's
looked after.
-Then I'll stay here as well.

01:13:36.586 --> 01:13:39.066
-What?
-Till we find somewhere with
more room.

01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:40.677
-And when will that be?
-Soon.

01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:42.026
Charlie!

01:13:48.511 --> 01:13:51.427
Charlie! Is he here?

01:13:53.167 --> 01:13:56.910
Charlie. Charlie, love, I'm
sorry. Let's go home.

01:13:56.954 --> 01:13:59.565
-Come on, let's go home.
-Charlie's gonna stay here with
me.

01:14:00.566 --> 01:14:03.177
Charlie? Charlie, come on.

01:14:04.831 --> 01:14:06.398
I want to stay with Dad.

01:14:06.442 --> 01:14:09.619
No. No, love, you don't realize
what you're saying.

01:14:09.662 --> 01:14:12.535
Didn't you hear him? You, go.

01:14:13.231 --> 01:14:15.276
No.

01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:19.237
Rob. Rob, I mean...
What, you're not gonna look
after him.

01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:22.588
Don't you tell me what I can do
with my son. Charlie, go
upstairs. Upstairs!

01:14:22.632 --> 01:14:24.155
-Charlie!
- Now.

01:14:24.198 --> 01:14:26.766
-Rob, please.
-Charlie stays here.

01:14:26.810 --> 01:14:29.247
-Or we'll see what a court of
law says.
-What?

01:14:29.290 --> 01:14:31.728
He'll tell them
the disgusting things he's seen.

01:14:33.077 --> 01:14:35.427
Disgusting? What's he...?

01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:39.387
If you come back here,
I'll call the police.

01:14:39.431 --> 01:14:41.520
You'll never see Charlie again.

01:14:43.043 --> 01:14:44.958
-Maybe we need to go.

01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:49.136
Margaret,
what's going on out there?

01:15:15.162 --> 01:15:16.337
Mmm...

01:16:40.683 --> 01:16:42.598
Charlie.

01:16:44.382 --> 01:16:45.731
Come with me.

01:17:49.839 --> 01:17:50.970
I...

01:18:11.948 --> 01:18:14.037
Does it hurt the tree
when you cut it down?

01:18:15.691 --> 01:18:17.605
It's a tree.

01:18:17.649 --> 01:18:19.433
But trees are alive.

01:18:23.611 --> 01:18:25.483
If you take him to court,

01:18:25.526 --> 01:18:27.964
he'll testify to the nature
of your relationship.

01:18:28.007 --> 01:18:31.532
And no judge would award the two
of you Charlie in that
circumstance.

01:18:35.058 --> 01:18:37.713
There are notices
in every paper.

01:18:38.975 --> 01:18:41.020
They need doctors.

01:18:43.501 --> 01:18:46.286
Only ones with good references.

01:18:46.330 --> 01:18:48.941
You are never going
to make that town home,

01:18:50.813 --> 01:18:52.205
not living like this.

01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:56.732
Those sort of people
don't change their minds.

01:19:00.518 --> 01:19:02.694
They'll never have
a doctor like you again.

01:19:04.261 --> 01:19:06.611
They don't want a doctor
like me.

01:19:09.483 --> 01:19:10.658
No.

01:19:12.182 --> 01:19:14.097
Thank you for seeing me, Jim.

01:19:16.273 --> 01:19:18.492
You'll visit again soon?

01:19:19.058 --> 01:19:20.625
With Meg?

01:19:23.149 --> 01:19:24.455
I'll see.

01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:28.328
It's a long drive.

01:19:39.818 --> 01:19:41.298
She thinks she's his
father

01:19:41.341 --> 01:19:43.474
just 'cause she's with my wife?

01:19:43.517 --> 01:19:46.433
It doesn't matter what
she thinks. The law's on your
side.

01:19:48.435 --> 01:19:50.611
Nobody wants her here.

01:19:50.655 --> 01:19:53.658
She can't work.
She can't walk down the street.

01:19:55.486 --> 01:19:58.315
You'll be here tonight
to help with Annie?

01:19:59.316 --> 01:20:00.970
Does she know what's happening?

01:20:02.145 --> 01:20:04.103
We've had words.

01:20:04.147 --> 01:20:05.801
She'll kick up a fuss.

01:20:05.844 --> 01:20:07.628
She knows what's good
for her.

01:20:07.672 --> 01:20:09.108
Stop!

01:20:19.902 --> 01:20:22.469
I need to think
straight.

01:20:22.513 --> 01:20:25.864
Jim says there are lots
of career opportunities out
there.

01:20:25.908 --> 01:20:29.128
-Not just doctors; all kinds.
-I'm gonna go and get him.

01:20:29.172 --> 01:20:31.652
-You can't!
-I have to.

01:20:31.696 --> 01:20:35.265
If I was any kind of mother,
I wouldn't have let him stay.

01:20:35.308 --> 01:20:37.223
I can't stand being here
without him.

01:20:37.267 --> 01:20:39.835
-Can't you?
-Of course I can't.

01:20:41.314 --> 01:20:43.316
We should've thought
about what would happen.

01:20:43.926 --> 01:20:45.057
I did.

01:20:46.145 --> 01:20:47.930
I tried to keep away from you.

01:20:50.236 --> 01:20:54.371
Lydia, Lydia! Please.
You know Robert will call the
police.

01:20:54.414 --> 01:20:56.460
I don't care.

01:20:56.503 --> 01:20:59.463
-I just want him home.
-But what then?

01:20:59.506 --> 01:21:02.118
We need to think this through.

01:21:02.161 --> 01:21:07.297
We can't just bring him back
here. It won't be like it was.

01:21:07.340 --> 01:21:10.300
If we tell Robert
that we'll leave quietly,

01:21:11.214 --> 01:21:13.738
that no one has to know,

01:21:13.781 --> 01:21:16.262
he might just let Charlie go.

01:21:23.052 --> 01:21:25.619
Thank you for coming.

01:21:37.675 --> 01:21:39.155
Who's at the door?

01:21:46.162 --> 01:21:49.034
-Stay in here.

01:21:50.557 --> 01:21:52.124
What's going on?

01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:55.562
What's going on?

01:22:03.396 --> 01:22:05.572
All right, Annie,
I need you to lie down.

01:22:05.616 --> 01:22:09.402
We're gonna fix your situation.
I just need you to stay calm.

01:22:10.403 --> 01:22:11.883
Ow! Get off!

01:22:11.927 --> 01:22:15.017
-Rob, I need... Rob...
- Ow! Get off me!

01:22:16.409 --> 01:22:18.716
- Shh.

01:22:18.759 --> 01:22:21.066
Get off me! Get off me! Mum!

01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:23.547
-Shh, shh, shh.

01:22:23.590 --> 01:22:24.983
No!

01:22:36.038 --> 01:22:38.431
No!

01:22:40.694 --> 01:22:43.262
No! No!

01:22:53.403 --> 01:22:56.754
No! No!

01:23:04.718 --> 01:23:07.417
What's happening
with Annie?

01:23:07.460 --> 01:23:09.810
Nothing.

01:23:13.597 --> 01:23:16.382
You're not to say anything about
this, do you understand?

01:23:19.342 --> 01:23:22.693
I think I should go to
Dr. Markham's. I need to go
check on the bees.

01:23:22.736 --> 01:23:25.522
Hey. It's time you stopped going
on about those bees.

01:23:29.656 --> 01:23:31.006
They listen to me.

01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:35.010
No, they don't.

01:23:44.062 --> 01:23:46.238
You can't be like this, Charlie.

01:23:47.892 --> 01:23:49.154
Be a man.

01:23:50.025 --> 01:23:51.591
What if I can't?

01:23:54.159 --> 01:23:56.509
Not everyone knows how to be
like you.

01:23:59.034 --> 01:24:00.818
What are you talking about?

01:24:00.861 --> 01:24:04.213
-I said what are you
talking about?

01:24:09.696 --> 01:24:11.394
I'll speak to you later.
Stay here.

01:24:37.376 --> 01:24:39.683
How are you doing, Annie, love?
Hmm?

01:24:39.726 --> 01:24:42.207
How are you feeling?
Are you all right?

01:25:18.809 --> 01:25:20.898
Help me!

01:25:32.779 --> 01:25:34.346
Dr. Markham!

01:25:36.522 --> 01:25:37.871
-Charlie?
-Charlie.

01:25:37.915 --> 01:25:41.397
- Annie needs you.
-What?

01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:43.703
- It's bad.
-I'll get my things.

01:25:43.747 --> 01:25:45.966
-Well, let's...
-No, stay. I'll deal with this.

01:25:46.010 --> 01:25:48.926
-Charlie, what's happened?
-You promised you wouldn't lie
to me.

01:25:49.970 --> 01:25:51.233
I know.

01:25:52.669 --> 01:25:54.149
I'm sorry.

01:25:56.020 --> 01:25:59.719
-I've missed you so much.
-You won't tell me the truth.

01:26:03.506 --> 01:26:05.508
I love Jean.

01:26:06.422 --> 01:26:07.553
I do.

01:26:09.773 --> 01:26:11.601
But I'm still the same person.

01:26:12.515 --> 01:26:14.647
Nothing else has changed.

01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:17.302
Look,

01:26:19.130 --> 01:26:23.961
a lie and a secret
aren't the same thing.

01:26:24.004 --> 01:26:26.050
You can't ever know everything
about me,

01:26:27.660 --> 01:26:30.533
like I can't ever know
everything about you, but...

01:26:30.576 --> 01:26:32.709
that's all right, isn't it?

01:26:45.287 --> 01:26:47.550
She's tachycardic.

01:26:47.593 --> 01:26:50.814
What did they use? Was it
something sharp or was it a
tube?

01:26:50.857 --> 01:26:54.818
It was a tube.

01:26:54.861 --> 01:26:57.342
How long ago did it happen?

01:26:57.386 --> 01:27:00.302
-How long?
-About an hour ago.

01:27:00.345 --> 01:27:02.042
What you've done
is illegal.

01:27:13.271 --> 01:27:15.404
Oh. She needs a hospital.

01:27:15.447 --> 01:27:17.580
She needs a dilation and
curettage procedure.

01:27:17.623 --> 01:27:21.061
Have you done that?
Can you do it, please? Please?

01:27:21.105 --> 01:27:22.802
-I don't know.
-Please? Please?

01:27:22.846 --> 01:27:24.761
Please? Please?

01:27:30.114 --> 01:27:32.986
Get her head down
and her legs up, quickly.

01:27:34.379 --> 01:27:35.554
All right.

01:27:37.817 --> 01:27:39.689
I need to sterilize.

01:27:49.873 --> 01:27:52.005
Charlie, go upstairs.

01:27:57.272 --> 01:28:01.101
Charlie, go up to your room
and stay there.

01:28:08.239 --> 01:28:11.764
-Charlie's not here.
-Get out of the way! Charlie!

01:28:13.549 --> 01:28:15.464
Where is he?

01:28:15.507 --> 01:28:17.335
-Stop it, stop it.
-Get out of my fucking way.
Charlie!

01:28:17.379 --> 01:28:19.598
-Rob!
-Get your fucking hands off me!

01:28:19.642 --> 01:28:20.991
-Charlie!
-Come back!

01:28:26.301 --> 01:28:28.128
-Get out.
-Where is he?

01:28:28.172 --> 01:28:31.175
-Get out of this house.
-Where the fuck is he, Lydia?

01:28:31.218 --> 01:28:33.351
Is he in there? Charlie!

01:28:42.491 --> 01:28:45.276
-Is she man enough for you?

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:47.017
She's more than you ever were.

01:28:48.584 --> 01:28:53.763
It's filthy, Lydia.
I won't have it in my town.

01:28:53.806 --> 01:28:57.375
I'm warning you.
I'm warning you!

01:28:57.419 --> 01:28:59.377
- Mum!
-We'll do what we want.

01:28:59.421 --> 01:29:00.639
And then what?

01:29:02.206 --> 01:29:04.991
Whatever I do next, I decide.

01:29:05.035 --> 01:29:07.211
I won't go with you
because you're a joke!

01:29:10.127 --> 01:29:11.911
Come on!

01:29:29.538 --> 01:29:31.496
-Get off me!
-Stay still!

01:29:39.722 --> 01:29:41.767
-Stop it!
-Stay still!

01:29:41.811 --> 01:29:43.290
Mum!

01:29:47.947 --> 01:29:49.079
Lydia!

01:29:56.086 --> 01:29:57.435
Stay still!

01:30:01.657 --> 01:30:03.528
Wake up!

01:30:03.572 --> 01:30:05.922
Come on, wake up!

01:30:05.965 --> 01:30:08.315
Wake up, please!

01:30:12.624 --> 01:30:16.149
-No, no!
-Look at me.

01:30:17.020 --> 01:30:19.239
You're still my wife.

01:30:23.592 --> 01:30:25.202
Come on!

01:30:42.915 --> 01:30:44.613
No!

01:31:06.112 --> 01:31:07.853
-Mum!
- Charlie.

01:31:10.639 --> 01:31:13.511
Charlie, Charlie...

01:31:13.555 --> 01:31:16.471
It's all right, Mum.
They're swarming.

01:31:45.195 --> 01:31:48.546
Mum, look. They're dancing.

01:33:39.570 --> 01:33:41.093
Annie?

01:33:43.792 --> 01:33:45.184
Annie?

01:33:56.761 --> 01:33:59.895
You try and sleep. Doctor.

01:34:01.636 --> 01:34:04.639
Thank you. Thank you.

01:34:07.250 --> 01:34:08.991
You'll be here, won't you?

01:35:40.343 --> 01:35:44.608
As summer comes to an end, the bees gather inside the hive.

01:35:56.576 --> 01:35:59.144
What?

01:35:59.188 --> 01:36:01.016
I'm watching your feet dance
around.

01:36:01.059 --> 01:36:03.888
Well, you can watch later.

01:36:03.932 --> 01:36:06.586
Right now, I need you to make
sure that Charlie's packed.

01:36:24.387 --> 01:36:26.824
I won't be able to talk to you.

01:36:28.304 --> 01:36:30.785
You won't know what I'm doing,
but...

01:36:33.091 --> 01:36:34.527
..you'll be all right.

01:36:40.142 --> 01:36:42.100
What do they do in there
in the winter?

01:36:42.797 --> 01:36:45.974
Sleep. Eat.

01:36:46.017 --> 01:36:48.411
Wait for the warmth
to come again.

01:36:51.893 --> 01:36:54.765
Mum says you're going to meet us
in a few months.

01:36:54.809 --> 01:36:58.856
I have to put things right here,
then I'll be along.

01:37:01.032 --> 01:37:04.209
You won't though, will you?

01:37:08.300 --> 01:37:09.736
I won't say anything.

01:37:10.868 --> 01:37:12.478
Thank you.

01:37:14.002 --> 01:37:16.047
You're my best friend.

01:37:22.184 --> 01:37:24.316
Come home one day, will you?

01:37:32.063 --> 01:37:33.630
Take care of the bees.

01:37:38.417 --> 01:37:40.376
Charlie, would you
run and find a porter?

01:37:51.343 --> 01:37:53.389
It'll be a while, won't it,

01:37:54.520 --> 01:37:56.261
before you can join us?

01:37:57.088 --> 01:37:58.524
There's a lot to do.

01:38:05.009 --> 01:38:06.402
I love you.

01:38:09.884 --> 01:38:11.494
I love you too.

01:38:47.095 --> 01:38:49.227
-Mum.

01:38:52.100 --> 01:38:54.406
- All aboard!
All aboard!

01:39:16.646 --> 01:39:18.082
Bye.

01:40:05.782 --> 01:40:08.872
So much has faded now.

01:40:08.915 --> 01:40:12.093
But I remember my mother
waving.

01:40:12.136 --> 01:40:14.573
And I remember Jean
walking away.

01:40:16.836 --> 01:40:19.274
I remember what their time together meant.

01:40:22.103 --> 01:40:25.062
My mother's life was brighter
than it ever would've been

01:40:25.106 --> 01:40:26.933
had Jean not shown her the way.

01:40:28.761 --> 01:40:32.026
And my mother's love gave Jean
the strength to stop running,

01:40:33.331 --> 01:40:34.985
to be proud.

01:40:37.074 --> 01:40:40.599
The buzz of change
was coming even to that town,

01:40:40.643 --> 01:40:45.300
although it was too soon and quiet for my mother and Jean to hear it together.

01:40:47.302 --> 01:40:49.434
But I had heard the echo.

01:40:51.654 --> 01:40:53.786
And so many of us
would follow it.

01:40:54.305 --> 01:41:00.330
