Hey!

01:08.502 --> 01:09.535
Fucking give it to me, please!

01:10.371 --> 01:11.303
- No!

01:11.305 --> 01:12.037
- Come on, just let us see it.

01:12.039 --> 01:12.971
- Give it to me!

01:12.973 --> 01:13.839
- Okay okay okay, fine, fine.

01:13.841 --> 01:15.074
Not them, just me.

01:15.076 --> 01:16.241
- Dude,
come on, cut it out.

01:16.243 --> 01:17.910
- I won't take a
picture, I swear, see?

01:17.912 --> 01:19.111
- Jeremy!

01:19.113 --> 01:19.912
- Phone's away,
just let me see it.

01:19.914 --> 01:20.746
- Everyone is gonna see.

01:20.748 --> 01:21.747
- Hold on.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.382
We're negotiating.

01:23.384 --> 01:26.351
- Seriously man, just
stop being assholes.

01:26.353 --> 01:27.853
Come on, this is stupid.

01:27.855 --> 01:28.855
- Let go!

01:56.282 --> 01:58.050
- No no no, I got it.

01:58.052 --> 02:00.018
Take what's-his-face,
the Korean kid,

02:00.020 --> 02:02.821
fucking kwong wah
kow or one of those

02:02.823 --> 02:04.156
horrible names or something.
- Dude, his parents are

02:04.158 --> 02:05.858
loaded, I should be so lucky.

02:05.860 --> 02:07.292
They probably pick me up in a

02:07.294 --> 02:09.961
hot tub rollover or
something.

02:09.964 --> 02:11.897
- The kid in PE,.

02:11.899 --> 02:13.532
- His would
warp the corsage.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.367
- Oh come on, it'd be your
good deed for the year.

02:15.369 --> 02:17.202
Pull a Christine
and have all the

02:17.204 --> 02:18.604
kids vote for him for prom king.

02:18.606 --> 02:20.072
- Dude, the movie's
Carrie, dipshit.

02:20.074 --> 02:22.241
- No no no, hold on, I
got it, I totally got it.

02:22.243 --> 02:23.242
You know who you should go with?

02:23.244 --> 02:24.076
- Yeah, who?

02:24.078 --> 02:25.010
- Cyclops.

02:25.012 --> 02:26.411
- Oh my god, you're so fucked.

02:26.413 --> 02:27.980
- Watch him show up with
a parrot and a peg leg.

02:27.982 --> 02:28.914
- He's right there.

02:28.916 --> 02:29.815
- So go ask him.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.016
- No!

02:31.018 --> 02:32.151
- Come on, now's
your chance, go on.

02:32.153 --> 02:33.886
Fine, fine, I'll do it.

02:33.888 --> 02:34.920
Hey.

02:34.922 --> 02:35.754
Hey you.

02:35.756 --> 02:36.855
What's his name?

02:36.857 --> 02:37.689
- Mike?

02:37.691 --> 02:38.924
- Hey, hey Mike!

02:38.926 --> 02:39.758
Hey!

02:39.760 --> 02:40.592
- Shut up!

02:40.594 --> 02:42.127
- Jesus, come on.

02:44.230 --> 02:45.063
Where are you going?

02:45.065 --> 02:46.932
- This is ridiculous.

02:48.401 --> 02:49.401
- We're awful.

03:22.902 --> 03:24.203
- Hey eyeball!

03:26.606 --> 03:29.808
There's something to your right!

03:29.810 --> 03:31.009
Just kidding.

03:33.646 --> 03:37.249
Careful, watch your,
nah, just kidding.

03:37.251 --> 03:40.385
Goddammit Matt, would you
stop fucking walking already?

03:40.387 --> 03:42.421
Get in the goddamn car.

03:49.028 --> 03:50.662
Hurry up, come on.

03:54.100 --> 03:56.635
Dude, so I got this new game.

03:56.637 --> 03:58.837
Open world, sandbox
kind of game.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.138
I dunno, it doesn't even have

04:00.140 --> 04:01.573
a name yet, that's
how new it is.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.976
My aunt grabbed this advanced

04:03.978 --> 04:06.144
beta testing copy
in la, oh yeah,

04:06.146 --> 04:08.280
she's staying with
us by the way.

04:08.282 --> 04:09.548
You'll meet her, she's cool.

04:09.550 --> 04:11.183
Anyway, it's nuts!

04:12.218 --> 04:13.452
Anywhere you wanna
go, you can go,

04:13.454 --> 04:14.720
anything you wanna
do, you can do.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.421
You can steal jets.

04:17.557 --> 04:19.558
- No, you can't just,
yeah, that's why

04:19.560 --> 04:21.827
they got a joint
account, douchebag

04:21.829 --> 04:24.263
because it's both
of ours, you can't,

04:24.265 --> 04:26.531
yes, yes I did, every paycheck!

04:26.533 --> 04:27.833
Yeah, and if I don't
see every penny

04:27.835 --> 04:29.001
returned by Friday
I will stick my

04:29.003 --> 04:30.002
lawyer in your ass so fast it'll

04:30.004 --> 04:31.370
make your fucking head explode!

04:31.372 --> 04:32.904
Hey!

04:32.906 --> 04:35.674
Hey, can you go get hunter
please, he's in his crib!

04:35.676 --> 04:38.176
Wait wait wait
wait wait, hold on.

04:38.178 --> 04:40.545
What do you mean until
I give back the ring?

04:41.849 --> 04:43.181
I gave back the ring.

04:43.183 --> 04:44.182
Yes.

04:44.184 --> 04:47.319
Yes I did, when you were here!

04:47.321 --> 04:48.253
- I got you.

04:48.255 --> 04:51.089
- Are you high or just retarded?

04:51.091 --> 04:55.060
Yeah, yeah, that's what I
thought, that's what I thought.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.596
- Mr. Cahill is out
sick, but he has left me

04:57.598 --> 05:00.866
instructions to have you
work on group projects.

05:00.868 --> 05:03.602
Today you will be
dissecting fetal pigs.

05:03.604 --> 05:05.003
If you do not feel
comfortable dissecting

05:05.005 --> 05:06.305
the actual animals,
there are computers

05:06.307 --> 05:07.539
set up on the side
of the room that

05:07.541 --> 05:09.875
will take you through
the virtual process.

05:09.877 --> 05:13.111
Okay, split up into
groups of two and you

05:13.113 --> 05:16.748
can find your specimens
on the back table.

05:26.759 --> 05:29.961
- Okay, so it says here we need

05:29.963 --> 05:32.431
to insert the blade through the

05:32.433 --> 05:34.132
body on one side of
the umbilical cord

05:34.134 --> 05:38.236
and cut posteriorly to
the base of the leg.

05:38.238 --> 05:40.872
What do you say, you
wanna do the honors?

05:40.874 --> 05:42.441
Okay, I'll do it.

05:45.945 --> 05:47.813
Who's getting hungry?

05:49.415 --> 05:51.416
That was a joke.

05:51.418 --> 05:52.784
Well, I mean...

05:54.253 --> 05:55.721
I'm a vegetarian, but it's also

05:55.723 --> 05:57.389
because of the
whole animal rights

05:57.391 --> 05:58.623
thing more than
just 'cause I got a

05:58.625 --> 06:01.927
waistband the size of
a low-flying blimp.

06:02.695 --> 06:05.831
That was a joke too.

06:05.833 --> 06:06.665
Kinda.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.233
Okay, never mind.

06:09.669 --> 06:12.104
Extend a single cut
along the midline

06:12.106 --> 06:13.372
of the ventricular
surface of the

06:13.374 --> 06:14.573
animal to about two centimeters

06:14.575 --> 06:15.841
from the chain, cut completely

06:15.843 --> 06:17.042
through the yadda
yadda yadda yadda,

06:17.044 --> 06:18.543
okay, what is this,
rocket science?

06:18.545 --> 06:19.545
All right.

06:26.919 --> 06:28.987
- Hey, what's going on?

06:30.022 --> 06:32.991
- I wanna suck off
Justin Langsey.

06:32.993 --> 06:33.993
- Who?

06:34.694 --> 06:35.894
- Number six.

06:38.030 --> 06:40.565
He's so clumsy, I love it.

06:40.567 --> 06:41.867
I just wanna yank
down those little

06:41.869 --> 06:43.869
black shorts of his
and suck his dick.

06:43.871 --> 06:45.504
- Okay, all right.

06:46.472 --> 06:49.207
- But he's got a
small dick, you know?

06:49.209 --> 06:50.275
You don't believe me about this,

06:50.277 --> 06:51.443
but I've got a sixth sense about

06:51.445 --> 06:53.178
these kinds of things,
I do, seriously.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.446
- I believe you.

06:54.448 --> 06:55.747
- I bet it is the size
of a dry erase marker.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.015
- Okay, do you wanna
just get out of here?

06:57.017 --> 07:00.452
- I don't care you know,
I'd suck it anyway.

07:00.454 --> 07:01.887
Probably make it easier.

07:01.889 --> 07:02.889
- Hello?

07:03.956 --> 07:05.724
- God he's beautiful.

07:05.726 --> 07:07.092
- Hey, you done?

07:07.094 --> 07:08.660
- Yeah, yeah.

07:08.662 --> 07:09.728
- Let's go.

07:10.730 --> 07:12.063
So the kid is just
standing there

07:12.065 --> 07:13.632
with his harmonica in his mouth.

07:13.634 --> 07:14.566
- Right.

07:14.568 --> 07:16.001
- And his dad's on his shoulders

07:16.003 --> 07:17.469
with a noose around his neck...

07:17.471 --> 07:20.672
- oh shit, I gotta introduce
you to Jill, hold on.

07:20.674 --> 07:21.907
Jill!

07:21.909 --> 07:23.141
- Basically he's
just left to stand

07:23.143 --> 07:25.677
there until, basically
until he passes out.

07:25.679 --> 07:26.912
- Jill!

07:26.914 --> 07:29.014
- And his dad hangs
to death, it's insane,

07:29.016 --> 07:31.349
it's such a great, great shot,

07:31.351 --> 07:34.553
I'll have to show
it to you sometime.

07:34.555 --> 07:35.520
- Yeah.

07:35.522 --> 07:38.190
Wait, how does he play
the harmonica if hes's...

07:38.192 --> 07:39.724
- he's not playing
the harmonica.

07:39.726 --> 07:40.726
- Jill!

07:41.727 --> 07:43.528
- It's like, it's
just like a simple...

07:43.530 --> 07:45.197
- she must've gone out.

07:45.199 --> 07:47.833
You wanna play video games?

07:47.835 --> 07:48.835
Fuck.

07:50.269 --> 07:51.870
Shit.

07:51.872 --> 07:55.407
- So there was this
new girl in bio today.

07:55.409 --> 07:56.241
- Oh yeah?

07:56.243 --> 07:57.476
Is she cute?

07:57.478 --> 07:58.643
Is she cute, you
gonna ask her out?

07:58.645 --> 07:59.611
You gonna break some hearts?

07:59.613 --> 08:00.846
- Pfft.

08:00.848 --> 08:02.047
- What pfft, what do you
say it like that for?

08:02.049 --> 08:02.881
Come on.

08:02.883 --> 08:03.815
You are a handsome...

08:03.817 --> 08:04.983
- I just mean...

08:04.985 --> 08:05.984
- you're a handsome
goddamn dude,

08:05.986 --> 08:07.586
seriously, I mean it, you got

08:07.588 --> 08:08.887
this whole monocular man thing

08:08.889 --> 08:10.222
going on, total secret agent,

08:10.224 --> 08:13.625
total Nick fury, Nick
fucking fury man,

08:14.627 --> 08:17.128
except in the comic
books, not in the movie,

08:17.130 --> 08:21.566
you're not Samuel L.
Jackson, you're not bald.

08:21.568 --> 08:22.801
Or black.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.536
- But dude, she is
the size of a house.

08:24.538 --> 08:26.905
I mean she should save time and

08:26.907 --> 08:28.673
shove me in a trash compactor.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.475
This girl would crush me.

08:30.477 --> 08:31.710
- No no no, she's not too fat.

08:31.712 --> 08:32.577
- Yeah she is.

08:32.578 --> 08:34.246
- She's not that fat.

08:34.248 --> 08:36.847
Just four feet too short, fuck.

08:36.850 --> 08:37.850
- What?

08:39.118 --> 08:42.953
- What do fat women and
mopeds have in common?

08:42.956 --> 08:44.389
- I don't know.

08:44.391 --> 08:45.690
- They're both to fun to
ride, but you wouldn't

08:45.692 --> 08:47.459
want your friends to
see you on either one.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.429
Right?

08:51.431 --> 08:53.164
- Okay, I have one.

08:54.667 --> 08:55.901
- Okay.

08:55.903 --> 08:57.736
- How do you find a
fat girl's vagina?

08:57.738 --> 08:59.204
- How?

08:59.206 --> 09:02.173
- You flip through the
folds until you smell crap.

09:02.175 --> 09:03.375
Then you go back one.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.445
- Where did
you even hear that?

09:07.447 --> 09:09.848
- I don't know, it was on
the Internet or something.

09:09.850 --> 09:13.785
- Hey where were you, we were
looking all over for you.

09:13.787 --> 09:16.588
Oh yeah, Matt, Jill, Jill, Matt.

09:17.557 --> 09:18.557
- Hey.

09:31.103 --> 09:33.138
Is anyone sitting here?

09:38.377 --> 09:40.345
So you're Elmo’s aunt?

09:42.815 --> 09:45.884
I mean that's
pretty weird right?

09:45.886 --> 09:48.186
How does that even happen?

09:50.323 --> 09:54.059
- His mom is my sister
and my dad's his grandpa.

09:54.061 --> 09:57.195
What, do you want me to
draw you a family tree?

09:57.197 --> 09:58.930
- No, no, I just...

10:01.233 --> 10:04.369
I don't know, 'cause I
mean my sister and I,

10:04.371 --> 10:07.238
we're like, I don't
know, I was just trying...

10:07.240 --> 10:08.907
- you was just trying to
make some weird roundabout

10:08.909 --> 10:10.942
apology for hurting my
feelings the other day.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.177
- What...

10:12.179 --> 10:13.712
- which is fucking
lame by the way.

10:13.714 --> 10:17.115
You can do that with a
fucking fat joke, ugh.

10:17.117 --> 10:20.218
So you clearly
wanna make amends or

10:20.220 --> 10:22.187
pacify your conscience
or weasel me

10:22.189 --> 10:23.521
into bed or whatever
the fuck it is

10:23.523 --> 10:24.723
that you're trying to do,
- wait, what?

10:24.725 --> 10:27.959
So why don't you just
get it over with?

10:31.564 --> 10:32.697
"I'm sorry"?

10:35.201 --> 10:36.835
- Okay, I'm sorry.

10:37.570 --> 10:39.437
- Do you mean it?

10:39.439 --> 10:40.505
- Yeah.

10:40.507 --> 10:41.507
- Great.

10:42.642 --> 10:46.945
We can be friends again,
take a seat.

10:55.721 --> 10:57.188
So how long have you known...

11:14.306 --> 11:15.607
You know what?

11:18.411 --> 11:21.780
This isn't really
doing it for me.

11:21.782 --> 11:25.483
You wanna get out of here
and eat someplace else?

11:25.485 --> 11:26.651
- Sure.

11:26.653 --> 11:28.019
I'll call Elmo.

11:29.355 --> 11:30.355
- Okay.

11:36.429 --> 11:37.896
Where are we?

11:37.898 --> 11:39.130
- Yeah, where the fuck
are we going man, come on.

11:39.132 --> 11:41.132
- No, it's going,
we're going to this

11:41.134 --> 11:43.568
cool cafe, bar,
diner type, I don't

11:43.570 --> 11:44.869
know what it is,
but there is a bar

11:44.871 --> 11:46.871
inside, we don't have to be 21.

11:46.873 --> 11:48.406
I used to go there all
the time with my sister,

11:48.408 --> 11:52.277
they've got great food,
great corned beef hash.

11:52.279 --> 11:56.581
I mean they have salads and
stuff too, so you're all set.

11:57.650 --> 12:00.185
- Dude, did you
just call me fat?

12:02.121 --> 12:02.954
- What?

12:02.956 --> 12:04.189
- What the fuck dude?

12:04.191 --> 12:05.957
- No, 'cause in class
you said that thing

12:05.959 --> 12:09.027
about being a vegetarian,
so I just thought...

12:09.029 --> 12:10.729
No no no no, hey, I didn't...

12:10.731 --> 12:11.996
- you're an insensitive
motherfucker.

12:11.998 --> 12:13.331
- I didn't mean anything by it.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.533
Hey, hey, I'm really, goddammit.

12:15.535 --> 12:16.935
- Why don't you go
for a walk, okay?

12:16.937 --> 12:17.769
Take a minute.

12:17.771 --> 12:19.471
- I, I wasn't trying...

12:19.473 --> 12:20.705
- why don't you just tell her

12:20.707 --> 12:22.073
to go on a diet
or something, huh?

12:22.075 --> 12:23.742
- I didn't mean, that's not what

12:23.744 --> 12:25.376
I meant at all, goddammit.

12:25.378 --> 12:26.778
- What if she said something
about your eye, huh?

12:26.780 --> 12:28.313
What if she said
something about your eye?

12:28.315 --> 12:30.782
Would you be okay with that?
- I don't care, ooooh shit.

12:33.587 --> 12:34.419
- We got you!

12:34.421 --> 12:35.220
- Nice!

12:35.222 --> 12:36.888
- That was so good!

12:36.890 --> 12:38.456
I wish you've could've
seen your face.

12:38.458 --> 12:39.457
- Oh yeah, that was good.

12:39.459 --> 12:40.892
- Did you see his face?

12:40.894 --> 12:42.594
You literally looked
like I was about to shoot

12:42.596 --> 12:44.529
your fucking puppy, man.
- That's not fucking funny.

12:44.531 --> 12:48.133
- Come on, I was just
fucking with you, dude!

12:48.135 --> 12:49.734
Do I look like a salad
type of girl to you?

12:49.736 --> 12:51.236
I have my own fucking
zip code, man.

12:51.238 --> 12:52.203
- I don't know.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.505
- Oh, that reminds me of a joke.

12:53.507 --> 12:55.807
What do fat women and
mopeds have in common?

12:55.809 --> 12:57.242
- Elmo already
told me that joke.

12:57.244 --> 12:58.910
- Oh fuck you,
you fucking thief.

12:58.912 --> 13:01.179
- What do you mean fucking
thief, it's a good joke.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.915
- No, it's a shitty goddamn
joke, but it's my joke.

13:03.917 --> 13:06.050
- You can't take ownership of
a joke, it's everyone's joke.

13:06.052 --> 13:06.885
- Whatever.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.020
- That's how jokes work.

13:10.856 --> 13:13.057
- So what about you then?

13:14.126 --> 13:15.193
I think it's gonna be great.

13:15.195 --> 13:16.427
- Can you get behind that?

13:16.429 --> 13:17.662
- Just, I don't have
road rage, okay?

13:17.664 --> 13:18.863
People that have road
rage do things that

13:18.865 --> 13:21.466
are unnecessary, I yell
when it's necessary.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.368
- Yeah, I'm telling
you you still have to

13:23.370 --> 13:25.804
be the bigger person
in that situation.

13:25.806 --> 13:27.539
- Be the bigger, have
you looked at me?

13:27.541 --> 13:29.474
I'm never the bigger person.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.342
- Never, I've known him
for a very long time.

13:31.344 --> 13:32.844
- Okay, all right, all right.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.915
Oh shit, I gotta go.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.082
Look out, look out.

13:38.084 --> 13:39.417
- What are you doing?

13:39.419 --> 13:41.619
- My mother just
texted me, I gotta go.

13:41.621 --> 13:43.688
I forgot, I promised her.
- Where are you going?

13:43.690 --> 13:45.390
- I gotta go make
lobster triangles

13:45.392 --> 13:46.925
with her for some benefit.

13:46.927 --> 13:48.159
- Lobster triangles?

13:48.161 --> 13:50.428
- Kids with aids
thing, whatever.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.897
Hey, can you drive him home?

13:53.732 --> 13:55.033
- Yeah, I can.

13:55.035 --> 13:57.135
- Great, okay cool, I'll
see you guys later, bye.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.137
- See ya.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.913
I'm about, oh.

14:11.284 --> 14:12.483
- He's funny.

14:12.485 --> 14:13.485
- Yeah.

14:53.826 --> 14:55.026
- Can I have a drag?

14:55.028 --> 14:56.028
- Sure.

15:15.514 --> 15:16.547
Nice place.

15:17.683 --> 15:19.317
- Yeah, it's okay.

15:20.152 --> 15:21.452
- Just saying.

15:29.161 --> 15:30.161
So...

15:31.931 --> 15:32.931
- What?

15:38.370 --> 15:40.939
I got so much homework to do.

15:42.775 --> 15:43.975
- Huh?

15:43.977 --> 15:46.611
- Got that calc test tomorrow.

15:47.579 --> 15:49.280
- Right, calc test.

15:51.383 --> 15:53.384
- But thanks for the ride.

15:53.386 --> 15:54.619
- Yeah, sure.

15:56.555 --> 15:57.522
- Goodbye.

15:57.524 --> 15:58.524
- Bye.

16:30.923 --> 16:31.756
- Hey.

16:31.758 --> 16:32.758
- Shh shh.

16:33.692 --> 16:37.829
You weaselly
motherfucker.

16:40.165 --> 16:41.833
- Did you have your
book club tonight?

16:41.835 --> 16:43.301
- Yeah, where were you?

16:43.303 --> 16:44.736
You were supposed to
watch him, I got home at

16:44.738 --> 16:46.137
the end of a double
expecting to drop him off.

16:46.139 --> 16:47.638
- Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.

16:47.640 --> 16:50.775
- God, this kid came in
right at the end of my shift.

16:50.777 --> 16:53.478
Decided to blow his head off
with his father's shotgun.

16:53.480 --> 16:54.746
Chickened out at the
last minute trying

16:54.748 --> 16:55.980
to split the
difference and instead

16:55.982 --> 16:57.648
lost his jaw, it's
a fucking mess.

16:57.650 --> 17:01.452
- I know, I'm so sorry,
just some stuff came up.

17:01.454 --> 17:03.921
Did you end up
skipping the meeting?

17:03.923 --> 17:05.823
- Nah, I took him.

17:05.825 --> 17:07.358
Screamed his head
off half the night,

17:07.359 --> 17:09.359
but it was a horror
novel, so whatever.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.362
- Yeah, how was it?

17:11.364 --> 17:13.097
- Oh are you kidding me?

17:13.098 --> 17:16.233
It was shit, they're all shit,
but whatever, they're fun.

17:16.236 --> 17:17.236
- Good.

17:20.539 --> 17:23.840
Hey, can I ask you
something, and just

17:25.010 --> 17:26.344
promise not to...
- You shut up.

17:26.346 --> 17:27.444
What?

17:27.446 --> 17:28.880
Shut up, what?

17:28.882 --> 17:30.615
- Make fun of me or whatever?

17:30.617 --> 17:32.850
- Come on, when I have
I ever made fun of you?

17:32.852 --> 17:33.951
- Like all the time?

17:33.953 --> 17:36.187
- Right, but lovingly.

17:36.189 --> 17:37.488
So what is it?

17:39.258 --> 17:41.059
What's the question?

17:42.294 --> 17:43.828
Hello!

17:43.830 --> 17:47.765
- Okay, it's stupid, no, just,
sorry, forget it, never mind.

17:52.838 --> 17:54.372
All right, how...

17:55.574 --> 17:58.709
How do you tell if
a girl likes you?

18:32.644 --> 18:34.679
- So basically they
just go over the lake

18:34.681 --> 18:36.314
and then I just shoot
them with my twin Gauge.

18:36.316 --> 18:37.615
- I'm kinda scared
of you right now.

18:37.617 --> 18:38.850
- Oh my gosh!

18:38.852 --> 18:40.284
- I'm just saying, I'm
just saying, it's like...

18:40.286 --> 18:41.686
- oh come on, it's really fun.

18:41.688 --> 18:42.687
It's like basically just...

18:42.689 --> 18:44.255
- I kinda wanna, oh!

18:44.257 --> 18:45.690
- Whoa, what the fuck?

18:45.692 --> 18:48.826
Watch where you're
going, you fat...

18:50.062 --> 18:52.096
- I'm sorry, do you have
something you wanna say to me?

18:52.098 --> 18:54.132
- No, it's too easy.

18:54.134 --> 18:56.334
You have a beautiful day.

19:03.308 --> 19:05.076
- Sorry about that,
I don't know what's

19:05.078 --> 19:06.511
going on, they're not
normally like that.

19:06.513 --> 19:09.380
- Yeah, I'm pretty
sure they are.

19:10.782 --> 19:13.551
- Oh hey, I see
someone's in AP English.

19:13.553 --> 19:14.752
I love this book,
have you actually got

19:14.754 --> 19:16.287
to the part where Sally
tells Phillip that

19:16.289 --> 19:18.456
she's pregnant right
before he's about to...

19:18.458 --> 19:20.525
- thanks for your help!

19:29.801 --> 19:30.635
- Ow!

19:30.637 --> 19:31.469
- Hey.

19:31.471 --> 19:32.303
- Fuck.

19:32.305 --> 19:33.571
- What's going on?

19:33.573 --> 19:35.573
- Nothing, just waiting.

19:35.575 --> 19:37.642
- Yeah, for Jill?

19:37.644 --> 19:38.876
- No.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.578
- Really, 'cause it's
her car right here.

19:40.580 --> 19:43.548
I mean well it's my mom's
car, but she's borrowing it.

19:43.550 --> 19:44.382
- Is it?

19:44.384 --> 19:45.616
- Yeah, yeah.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.718
Didn't she give you
a ride last night?

19:47.720 --> 19:50.288
- Oh yeah, yeah, no, she did.

19:50.290 --> 19:52.223
- That's kinda weird,
you don't remember the...

19:52.225 --> 19:53.424
- I guess I forgot.

19:53.426 --> 19:54.559
- Forgot, that's seems weird.

19:54.561 --> 19:55.860
Anyway, check this out.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.094
Folks are going
to Norway on a bit

19:57.096 --> 19:59.564
of a buying trip, but
what the hell, might as

19:59.566 --> 20:01.666
well throw a
while they're down there.

20:01.668 --> 20:02.900
- Oh.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.001
Neat.

20:04.003 --> 20:05.269
When is it?

20:05.271 --> 20:07.838
- Next month, during the
regular prom-type prom.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.073
- Okay.

20:09.075 --> 20:10.508
- Yeah, I talked to
tonic, we're gonna

20:10.510 --> 20:12.610
get three kegs, have
some pizza, dance around,

20:12.612 --> 20:14.011
play some games that don't suck,

20:14.013 --> 20:15.112
whatever, yeah,
should be a pretty

20:15.114 --> 20:16.714
good time, but you should come.

20:16.716 --> 20:17.915
What am I saying,
of course you're

20:17.917 --> 20:19.317
gonna come, what else
do you have to do?

20:19.319 --> 20:20.251
Sit around your house having

20:20.253 --> 20:21.686
no depth perception or whatever?

20:21.688 --> 20:22.620
- Come on.

20:22.622 --> 20:23.754
- Hey, how far's my hand?

20:23.756 --> 20:24.555
How far's my hand?
- Stop it.

20:24.557 --> 20:25.223
- How far's my hand?

20:25.225 --> 20:26.390
- Fuck you, man.

20:26.392 --> 20:27.325
- Anyway, I'm
gonna go to kinko's

20:27.327 --> 20:28.392
and make some copies, and I need

20:28.394 --> 20:29.860
you to come with me, all right?

20:29.862 --> 20:31.696
So let's go, let's go, come on.

20:31.698 --> 20:33.197
- Hey, I really can't...

20:33.199 --> 20:34.565
- Oh hey, what's going on?

20:34.567 --> 20:36.033
- What's happening?

20:36.035 --> 20:37.235
- Trying to get one-eyed Willy

20:37.237 --> 20:38.769
here to go to
kinko's for copies.

20:38.771 --> 20:40.705
- Mmm-mmm, sorry.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.974
Did you tell him
about our project?

20:42.976 --> 20:43.808
- What?

20:43.810 --> 20:45.409
- What project?

20:45.411 --> 20:47.211
- Wait, you really didn't tell?

20:47.213 --> 20:51.282
We, this is so funny.

20:52.150 --> 20:53.985
Yeah, no, we have a thing.

20:53.987 --> 20:55.386
We have to go to the beach and

20:55.388 --> 20:57.488
collect 20 different types of

20:57.490 --> 21:00.458
shells for this
thing or whatever.

21:01.460 --> 21:03.294
Yeah, but you didn't tell him?

21:03.296 --> 21:05.096
- You have to go to the beach to

21:05.098 --> 21:06.964
collect shells in the winter?

21:06.966 --> 21:08.466
- I know, right?

21:08.468 --> 21:09.700
What the hell is wrong with
the teachers here, right?

21:09.702 --> 21:11.769
We're all of a sudden
in the third grade, man?

21:11.771 --> 21:13.738
It's like no, you won't
weasel out of this,

21:13.740 --> 21:15.840
I am not doing this shit
on my own, I'm savvy

21:15.842 --> 21:17.608
like a motherfucking
toothpick, so let's go.

21:17.610 --> 21:18.843
- Okay.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.111
- Yeah, no, I mean
I'm good to go too.

21:20.113 --> 21:21.212
- We'll see you at the house.

21:21.214 --> 21:22.480
- I'll call you.

21:22.482 --> 21:23.514
- I'll just
see you, I'll see

21:23.516 --> 21:25.016
you tonight at the house.

21:25.018 --> 21:26.651
- Well give me an hour, I
can do the shells thing.

21:26.653 --> 21:28.486
- Yeah, I'll
see you later, bye!

21:28.488 --> 21:29.754
- Okay, well let me know
where you're going 'cause

21:29.756 --> 21:33.457
I can meet you later
if you want to, right?

21:37.095 --> 21:40.598
- You didn't have to
do that, you know.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.600
- I'm sorry, I just...

21:42.602 --> 21:43.901
I get to see him
all the time, I hang

21:43.903 --> 21:46.103
out with him every
day, and he's great,

21:46.105 --> 21:49.240
he's great, I just
know him so well.

21:51.109 --> 21:53.577
I want to get to know you.

21:53.579 --> 21:55.313
More than I do now.

21:57.182 --> 21:58.449
Is that weird?

21:58.451 --> 22:00.284
- Hey, are we going to
the beach right now?

22:00.286 --> 22:01.218
To collect shells?

22:01.220 --> 22:02.820
- No, fuck that.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.689
What am I, a personal ad?

22:04.691 --> 22:06.724
No, let's go to the dump.

23:02.381 --> 23:03.948
- Anti-prom?

23:03.950 --> 23:05.549
That's wicked cool.

23:05.551 --> 23:06.884
- Thank you.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.486
- Yeah, you did this
all by yourself?

23:08.488 --> 23:09.720
- Yeah, yeah yeah.

23:09.722 --> 23:13.290
- God, you're really
talented, that's cool.

23:13.292 --> 23:15.259
You go to Ben frank?

23:15.261 --> 23:16.527
- Yeah.

23:16.529 --> 23:18.896
- Oh my god, me too,
I mean I went there.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.197
- How much is it, by the way?

23:20.199 --> 23:21.199
- It's pretty brutal.

23:22.168 --> 23:23.534
- Yeah.

23:23.536 --> 23:25.936
Hey, so where is it?

23:25.938 --> 23:26.938
The party?

23:32.811 --> 23:34.044
- It's in Laramie.

23:34.046 --> 23:36.914
So yeah, you should come.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.182
- Excuse me?

23:38.184 --> 23:40.117
- It's like shit, you
fucking faggots, man.

23:40.119 --> 23:43.354
It's unbelievable,
really, seriously.

24:02.274 --> 24:03.107
- Bye.

24:03.109 --> 24:04.109
- Bye.

24:29.534 --> 24:32.069
Hi, hey, is Matt right there?

24:32.071 --> 24:34.338
I just, I have his phone, I
wanted to return it to him.

24:34.340 --> 24:35.973
- I'm sorry, who
are you looking for?

24:35.975 --> 24:37.007
- Hey Jill!

24:47.219 --> 24:51.522
I just need the restroom quick,
just stay here for a second.

24:59.931 --> 25:01.432
- How old is she?

25:02.234 --> 25:03.367
- It's a he.

25:16.548 --> 25:17.681
- All right.

25:20.118 --> 25:21.118
Okay.

25:22.053 --> 25:23.053
- Yeah.

25:31.263 --> 25:32.363
- Shut that behind you.

25:32.365 --> 25:33.365
- Yeah.

26:00.392 --> 26:02.459
Is this your idea?

26:02.461 --> 26:04.795
- Oh, no, it was like
that when we moved in.

26:04.797 --> 26:08.198
I just never got
around to changing it.

26:36.561 --> 26:37.828
- You play?

26:37.830 --> 26:41.465
- No, I used to, but
my hands are clumsy.

26:41.467 --> 26:43.801
Can't really keep a beat either.

26:43.803 --> 26:45.536
My mom got it for me

26:45.538 --> 26:47.237
right after the whole eye thing.

26:47.239 --> 26:49.073
I guess she thought
'cause my vision

26:49.075 --> 26:50.374
was messed up that
I should focus

26:50.376 --> 26:53.344
on something
auditory or whatever,

26:54.679 --> 26:57.815
but yeah, never got
past chopsticks.

27:17.469 --> 27:18.836
You sing, Matt?

27:20.338 --> 27:21.338
- No.

27:22.173 --> 27:24.174
- You never sang before?

27:24.176 --> 27:26.910
- I mean I'm not a good singer.

27:26.912 --> 27:29.346
- Will you sing with me?

27:29.348 --> 27:30.280
- I don't know it.

27:30.282 --> 27:32.182
- Come on, okay.

27:32.184 --> 27:34.752
We'll start with something easy.

27:34.754 --> 27:35.586
Right?

27:35.588 --> 27:36.720
Chorus is...

27:47.099 --> 27:49.466
Think you can do that part?

28:18.329 --> 28:20.264
- You're kind of amazing.

28:20.266 --> 28:23.167
- Yeah.

28:46.357 --> 28:47.357
Okay.

28:52.130 --> 28:55.766
I won't lie to you if
you don't lie to me.

28:56.801 --> 28:58.335
How's that sound?

28:59.370 --> 29:01.205
Just be real with me.

29:04.142 --> 29:05.275
Shake on it?

29:29.701 --> 29:31.268
- Oh god.

29:31.270 --> 29:32.270
All right.

29:36.574 --> 29:37.574
Oh shit.

30:21.986 --> 30:23.053
How was it?

30:26.591 --> 30:29.893
- Like, you mean
like how did it...

30:29.895 --> 30:32.696
- like was it okay, or...

30:32.698 --> 30:33.697
- I don't know, you tell me.

30:33.699 --> 30:35.632
- Oh god.

30:35.634 --> 30:36.634
Jesus.

30:40.872 --> 30:43.173
Have you done that before?

30:44.642 --> 30:48.445
Oh, sorry, don't answer
that, that's stupid.

30:53.184 --> 30:57.154
- Well I should probably
get going, so...

30:57.156 --> 31:00.858
- Hey, I just, can
I ask you something?

31:00.860 --> 31:02.359
- Sure, yeah.

31:02.361 --> 31:05.162
- You can totally say no if
you want, there's no pressure.

31:05.164 --> 31:06.363
- What is it?

31:11.536 --> 31:14.504
- Do you wanna go
to prom with me?

31:58.883 --> 32:00.284
Are you wearing makeup?

32:00.286 --> 32:01.852
- No.

32:01.854 --> 32:03.453
Chicks walking around
with paint slathered on

32:03.455 --> 32:06.590
their faces, they look
like fucking oompa loompas.

32:06.592 --> 32:07.592
Seriously.

32:08.393 --> 32:09.927
Why, do you care?

32:10.962 --> 32:14.898
- Oh no, I just thought
most girls did is all.

32:15.733 --> 32:18.035
- Well I'm not most girls.

32:34.619 --> 32:36.053
What the?

32:36.055 --> 32:37.654
Oh no fucking way, dude!

32:37.656 --> 32:39.723
- Are you okay?

32:39.725 --> 32:41.124
Oh shit.

32:41.126 --> 32:43.794
Maybe I can get some...

32:43.796 --> 32:48.098
Can try and find some shoes
around here somewhere.

32:52.937 --> 32:55.906
- Wanna go to Elmo’s thing?

32:55.908 --> 32:57.107
- You mean do I
wanna play cleanup

32:57.109 --> 32:58.709
crew for party of the year?

32:58.711 --> 33:00.110
Nah.

33:00.112 --> 33:01.745
- Yeah, me neither.

33:04.048 --> 33:06.516
- So what should we do then?

34:01.606 --> 34:05.409
Who did you imagine
yourself ending up with?

34:06.144 --> 34:07.944
- What do you mean?

34:07.946 --> 34:09.713
- You know,
when you lie around

34:09.715 --> 34:12.681
and think about
girls or whatever.

34:14.918 --> 34:17.420
What do you think she'd be like?

34:17.422 --> 34:19.556
Is she anything like me?

34:23.527 --> 34:24.561
- Honestly?

34:27.931 --> 34:32.235
I just spent so much time
trying to get through each day.

34:34.639 --> 34:37.706
Girls never really
crossed my mind.

34:39.744 --> 34:43.045
I know that sounds
so pathetic, but...

34:47.385 --> 34:49.753
What about you, what'd
you think of me?

34:49.755 --> 34:51.221
- Of you?

34:51.223 --> 34:52.688
- You can be honest you know,

34:52.690 --> 34:54.558
I don't care, I'm just curious.

34:54.560 --> 34:55.560
- I...

34:56.960 --> 34:59.429
I thought you were handsome.

35:09.540 --> 35:10.774
Can I see it?

35:36.801 --> 35:38.201
- Sorry.

35:44.108 --> 35:45.108
- Check it out.

35:45.110 --> 35:46.810
Cyclops has a lady.

35:46.812 --> 35:48.411
If ever
there were two

35:48.413 --> 35:51.915
people who shouldn't be
allowed to procreate.

35:51.917 --> 35:53.216
- Maybe they're free.

35:53.218 --> 35:54.218
- Right?

35:56.354 --> 36:00.023
Fuck it, models
don't need to talk.

36:00.025 --> 36:01.358
Talking to you.

36:10.535 --> 36:11.735
- What happened?

36:11.737 --> 36:13.136
Okay, so you know
that list they posted

36:13.138 --> 36:16.106
in the hallway, the
one on the school list,

36:16.108 --> 36:18.108
which schools people
have gotten into?

36:18.110 --> 36:19.543
- Yeah.

36:19.545 --> 36:22.579
- Okay, well Justin Langsey
got into pilgrim mass.

36:22.581 --> 36:25.115
- Oh yeah, that's the school
you're going to right?

36:25.117 --> 36:26.416
- I mean at first I was
like I'll think about it,

36:26.418 --> 36:28.285
but now I'm like fuck
yeah, why not right?

36:28.287 --> 36:29.786
But that's not
even the best part.

36:29.788 --> 36:31.321
That's not even the best part.

36:31.323 --> 36:32.556
I'm standing there
and I'm scanning

36:32.558 --> 36:34.891
the list and all
of a sudden Justin

36:34.893 --> 36:37.527
comes up and he
looks at the list,

36:37.529 --> 36:41.264
so I point to my
name and I go hey,

36:41.266 --> 36:44.034
looks like we're going
to the same school.

36:44.036 --> 36:45.035
- All right.

36:45.037 --> 36:45.869
- Smooth.

36:45.871 --> 36:47.370
- Right, right?

36:47.372 --> 36:51.041
Okay, so then he says nice,
I'll see you there, right?

36:52.343 --> 36:54.144
Like he wants to
hang out, he thinks

36:54.146 --> 36:57.080
it's nice or something,
you know what I mean?

36:57.082 --> 36:58.315
- It's something.

36:58.317 --> 36:59.783
- You know who I'm
talking about, Jill?

36:59.785 --> 37:01.284
Number six, basketball team,
the nice ass?

37:01.286 --> 37:02.552
- Yeah, we know.

37:02.554 --> 37:04.521
- Oh my god, the things
I wanna do to that ass.

37:04.523 --> 37:05.522
- We know.

37:05.524 --> 37:06.756
- I wish I could
tell you, I mean

37:06.758 --> 37:08.225
I've told you, but
oh god, I actually,

37:08.227 --> 37:09.492
and this is great, I had a dream

37:09.494 --> 37:10.860
the other night that
he came on my face...

37:10.862 --> 37:13.396
- would you shut the fuck up?

37:14.332 --> 37:15.632
- What?

37:15.634 --> 37:18.401
- I just don't wanna
hear about it is all.

37:18.403 --> 37:19.603
- What are you talking about?

37:19.605 --> 37:20.870
- I get that you
wanna have sex with

37:20.872 --> 37:22.339
Justin, and that's
great, but I don't

37:22.341 --> 37:24.574
know why I hear about ever
single fucking detail.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.409
- 'Cause it's guy talk.

37:26.411 --> 37:27.577
- What?

37:27.579 --> 37:28.812
- I mean we're
guys, we're talking,

37:28.814 --> 37:30.013
I mean you tell me
about the girls.

37:30.015 --> 37:31.581
- No, I don't though,
when do I do that?

37:31.583 --> 37:33.350
- Right, you could
if you wanted to,

37:33.352 --> 37:34.818
and I would listen
to you right because

37:34.820 --> 37:36.186
that's how it goes,
that's what friendship is,

37:36.188 --> 37:38.388
we talk, that's what
it is, I'd listen.

37:38.390 --> 37:39.823
- All right, okay, yeah yeah,

37:39.825 --> 37:43.560
you're in love with
a homophobic asshole!

37:43.562 --> 37:47.197
- Yeah, well you're in
love with a fucking slut.

37:47.199 --> 37:48.031
- What?

37:48.033 --> 37:49.299
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

37:49.301 --> 37:50.600
- Since when
was I in this fight?

37:50.602 --> 37:52.636
- Hold on, did
she ever tell you?

37:52.638 --> 37:54.804
She ever really
told you why she got

37:54.806 --> 37:56.006
shipped across the country?

37:56.008 --> 37:57.207
Has she really
gone into it, huh?

37:57.209 --> 37:58.942
- Can we not do this right now?

37:58.944 --> 38:01.478
- Jill, I'm sorry, has
she ever gone into it?

38:01.480 --> 38:03.680
All the 40 year old fucking men,

38:03.682 --> 38:05.815
skeezy, middle-aged
dudes that just

38:05.817 --> 38:07.484
wanna fuck some
big-titted teenager.

38:07.486 --> 38:09.152
- Fuck you!

38:09.154 --> 38:10.387
Seriously!

38:10.389 --> 38:11.588
- And they still call
her too, you know that?

38:11.590 --> 38:13.189
From 3,000 miles away,
and you know why?

38:13.191 --> 38:14.691
- You're a piece of shit.

38:14.693 --> 38:18.061
- 'Cause they know that
she's just that desperate.

38:18.063 --> 38:19.129
- Fuck you!

38:19.897 --> 38:22.098
- Hey guys, stop, come on!

38:22.100 --> 38:23.100
Come on!

38:30.141 --> 38:31.608
- Soon as my parents
get back from Norway,

38:31.610 --> 38:34.411
I am telling them everything
you've been up to.

38:34.413 --> 38:38.715
Running around, leaving
class to fuck this.

38:39.750 --> 38:40.917
They're gonna have you
back on a plane home

38:40.919 --> 38:44.487
so fuck it'll make
your fucking head spin.

38:48.592 --> 38:50.060
- Fucking idiot!

39:01.639 --> 39:03.606
- He's right you know.

39:05.343 --> 39:06.643
- What do you mean, about what?

39:06.645 --> 39:08.178
- I mean if I don't go home now,

39:08.180 --> 39:10.714
I have to go home eventually.

39:11.816 --> 39:12.816
- Why?

39:14.251 --> 39:17.187
- My stuff's there,
my friends are there.

39:17.189 --> 39:18.555
- Your friends?

39:20.191 --> 39:22.492
- I got into school there.

39:27.231 --> 39:28.465
- Wait, what?

39:29.233 --> 39:31.701
When were you gonna tell me?

39:32.770 --> 39:34.471
- Dad called today.

39:36.340 --> 39:38.475
The plane leaves Friday.

39:40.211 --> 39:41.678
- I mean what about graduation,

39:41.680 --> 39:43.847
you're just gonna,
just not gonna go?

39:43.849 --> 39:44.681
- I can't.

39:44.683 --> 39:46.716
- I mean what the fuck?

39:47.685 --> 39:48.718
I mean wow.

39:49.954 --> 39:50.954
Okay.

39:53.691 --> 39:56.659
So what, I mean
now what do we do?

39:58.329 --> 39:59.996
- Realistically
or ideally because

39:59.998 --> 40:01.564
I mean in a perfect world I want

40:01.566 --> 40:03.233
you to move out there with me

40:03.235 --> 40:04.701
and just pack your
shit and grab a

40:04.703 --> 40:05.869
plane ticket, but you wouldn't

40:05.871 --> 40:09.172
do that, that's crazy,
so I don't know.

40:10.841 --> 40:12.041
I don't know.

40:20.017 --> 40:21.017
- Okay.

40:23.721 --> 40:25.155
Let's do it.

40:25.157 --> 40:26.356
- Do what?

40:26.358 --> 40:27.724
- Let's go, I wanna
move with you.

40:27.726 --> 40:28.858
- Wait, are you serious?

40:28.860 --> 40:29.692
- Yeah.

40:29.694 --> 40:30.593
- No.

40:30.595 --> 40:31.961
You wanna move?

40:33.898 --> 40:35.698
You'd do that for me?

40:35.700 --> 40:36.766
Yeah, okay.

40:38.235 --> 40:39.702
- Yeah, I would.

40:41.439 --> 40:43.473
Come on, let's just go.

40:46.343 --> 40:47.343
Why not?

40:57.721 --> 40:59.122
- Better hurry.

41:00.791 --> 41:02.258
- Jill?

41:02.260 --> 41:03.493
That girl you met a couple
months ago, that Jill?

41:03.495 --> 41:05.161
- It was 12 weeks ago,
so that's three months.

41:05.163 --> 41:08.364
- Oh excuse me, three
months, that's a lifetime.

41:08.366 --> 41:09.799
- Yup, I'm going.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.267
- Yeah, it certainly
looks that way doesn't it?

41:11.269 --> 41:14.003
- Mmmhm, we're going this
Friday and that's it,

41:14.005 --> 41:15.238
so if you have anything to say

41:15.240 --> 41:16.473
you can just keep
it to yourself.

41:16.475 --> 41:17.540
- So this, you're
just gonna, hey,

41:17.542 --> 41:19.209
this, you're just gonna skip it?

41:19.211 --> 41:20.610
One of the most
important days of

41:20.612 --> 41:22.946
your life and you're
just gonna flat out...

41:22.948 --> 41:24.781
- yeah, I met someone, okay?

41:24.783 --> 41:26.483
I met a girl that
actually likes me.

41:26.485 --> 41:27.717
- You'll meet others!

41:27.719 --> 41:28.885
- Someone who makes
my heart feel like

41:28.887 --> 41:30.186
I'm not alone in
this world, who makes

41:30.188 --> 41:33.323
me feel like I
matter, like I'm sexy.

41:33.325 --> 41:34.624
Yeah, I know that sounds fucking

41:34.626 --> 41:37.260
stupid to you,
okay, but it's true!

41:37.262 --> 41:38.495
Fuck it!

41:38.497 --> 41:40.230
Okay, I'm going, and
you can't stop me.

41:40.232 --> 41:42.765
- You're in love with this girl?

41:42.767 --> 41:43.767
Go for it.

41:44.902 --> 41:47.837
Haul anchor, head
across the country.

41:47.839 --> 41:51.274
No plan, no money,
no safety net.

41:51.276 --> 41:52.709
That's what I did when mom died.

41:52.711 --> 41:54.844
I'd be a hypocrite
if I told you not to.

41:54.846 --> 41:56.713
Quick question for
you, how are you

41:56.715 --> 41:59.816
gonna pay for rent
when you're out there?

41:59.818 --> 42:02.085
First, last month's
rent, security deposit,
transportation?

42:02.087 --> 42:03.019
- I'll get a job.

42:03.021 --> 42:04.721
- Oh, of course.

42:04.723 --> 42:06.789
I'm sure that you will,
the economy's just kicking.

42:06.791 --> 42:08.057
- Just leave me
alone, okay, please.

42:08.059 --> 42:08.992
- Just on the off
chance you don't,

42:08.994 --> 42:10.226
what are you gonna do then?

42:10.228 --> 42:13.029
- Just get the fuck out of here!

42:21.038 --> 42:22.038
Jesus.

42:23.274 --> 42:24.274
Goddammit.

43:44.521 --> 43:46.456
- Oh my god, I
can't wait to see you,

43:46.458 --> 43:47.824
it's been so frigging
long, I feel like

43:47.826 --> 43:51.060
I'm gonna die if I don't
get to fuck you soon.

43:51.062 --> 43:55.098
- Yeah, no, I'm looking
forward to that too.

43:55.100 --> 43:56.899
- I hope so
because I've got a

43:56.901 --> 43:59.235
special surprise for
you when you get here.

43:59.237 --> 44:00.237
- Oh yeah?

44:00.871 --> 44:02.372
What is it?

44:02.374 --> 44:05.441
- If I told you, it
wouldn't be a surprise, dummy.

44:05.443 --> 44:06.743
Trust me, you'll like it.

44:06.745 --> 44:07.745
- Okay.

44:08.412 --> 44:09.646
- What about you?

44:09.648 --> 44:11.447
Bringing anything for me?

44:11.449 --> 44:13.416
- I don't know, maybe.

44:16.453 --> 44:17.887
- So are we just
gonna ignore the fact

44:17.889 --> 44:20.023
that you've got a
second eye now, or...

44:20.025 --> 44:21.758
- I kept waiting for
you to ask about it.

44:21.760 --> 44:23.026
- I mean I didn't
wanna just bring it,

44:23.028 --> 44:25.828
I mean it seems
like it'd be rude.

44:25.830 --> 44:26.763
- No.

44:26.765 --> 44:28.931
- So what, was it surgery or...

44:28.933 --> 44:32.001
- No no no no, it's
just a prosthetic.

44:32.003 --> 44:34.070
- Oh, so like glass?

44:34.072 --> 44:37.473
- Plastic acrylic is
what they call it.

44:39.276 --> 44:40.276
- Cool.

44:40.978 --> 44:42.145
- I mean how does it look?

44:42.147 --> 44:43.713
- No, yeah, no, it
looks, yeah, it's good.

44:43.715 --> 44:45.181
Yeah, it's cool.

44:46.283 --> 44:47.283
- Good.

44:49.253 --> 44:53.022
- So how long you
gonna be gone for?

44:53.024 --> 44:54.323
- Just a week.

44:57.294 --> 45:01.064
This is part one of our
two part plan, so...

45:02.032 --> 45:03.666
- What's part two?

45:05.135 --> 45:06.936
- To move out there.

45:22.286 --> 45:25.855
All right, well
thanks for the ride.

45:25.857 --> 45:27.523
- Hey man, have a safe trip.

45:27.525 --> 45:28.525
- Okay.

45:29.727 --> 45:30.727
See ya.

45:35.999 --> 45:38.468
- Hey Matt, wait a minute.

45:38.470 --> 45:39.470
- Hmm?

45:43.307 --> 45:45.274
- When you see Jill...

45:47.444 --> 45:49.178
Tell her I'm sorry?

46:52.176 --> 46:53.543
- Hey stranger.

47:04.354 --> 47:05.354
Surprise.

47:28.345 --> 47:30.713
So I'm liking the new look.

47:31.748 --> 47:32.882
Is it glass?

47:34.351 --> 47:36.152
- Plastic acrylic.

47:36.154 --> 47:37.154
- Mmmm.

47:38.121 --> 47:39.689
It looks really good.

47:39.691 --> 47:40.990
Very lifelike.

47:50.033 --> 47:51.734
I took a bunch of
pictures before I

47:51.736 --> 47:55.404
started and been
sending you those.

47:55.406 --> 47:58.741
In case you were wondering
why doesn't it match.

48:04.014 --> 48:05.014
So...

48:07.618 --> 48:08.551
What do you think?

48:08.553 --> 48:11.120
- You're gonna miss your turn.

48:13.657 --> 48:14.657
- Thanks.

48:16.260 --> 48:19.462
Science building, math
building, art studio

48:19.464 --> 48:22.098
is back there as well
as the music studio.

48:22.100 --> 48:23.332
That's where I've been spending

48:23.334 --> 48:25.601
most of my time, where
all my classes are.

48:25.603 --> 48:27.136
I'm all stocked up
on music electives,

48:27.138 --> 48:29.372
but I'm gonna be
fucked senior year

48:29.374 --> 48:30.640
when I have to fulfill the ones

48:30.642 --> 48:33.476
I'm supposed to, but
living in the moment.

48:33.478 --> 48:35.478
- Spin man,
spin spin spin spin spin!

48:35.480 --> 48:36.712
- Come on pat, you got this guy!

48:36.714 --> 48:38.080
- Come on
man, you got this!

48:38.082 --> 48:39.615
Come on, come on!

48:40.784 --> 48:43.152
Go baby, come on, come on!

48:43.154 --> 48:45.388
You got him, you got him!

48:47.724 --> 48:49.926
Come on, come on, go, go!

48:51.561 --> 48:52.828
- Go baby, come on!

48:52.830 --> 48:53.829
- All right
man, chug it, chug it!

48:53.831 --> 48:55.197
- Come on!

48:55.199 --> 48:56.032
Man, you got it!

48:56.034 --> 48:57.099
- Come on!

48:57.101 --> 48:58.634
Come on, Jabroni!

48:59.736 --> 49:01.637
You got it, you
got it, swing it.

49:01.639 --> 49:02.738
Bam!

49:05.376 --> 49:06.776
- In your face!

49:07.511 --> 49:10.279
Oh my god, that's some goodness.

49:12.182 --> 49:14.183
- You see something you like?

49:14.185 --> 49:15.584
- What?

49:15.586 --> 49:18.754
No no, I just, I know that girl.

49:18.756 --> 49:20.790
She went to my high
school for a little bit.

49:20.792 --> 49:22.425
- You should've brought
her to the cattle call.

49:22.427 --> 49:25.895
That ass alone will
put us over the top.

49:32.602 --> 49:33.836
- Hey!

49:33.838 --> 49:34.838
- Hi!

49:37.375 --> 49:39.375
- Okay everyone,
everyone, okay, this is Matt.

49:39.377 --> 49:40.209
- Hi Matt.

49:40.211 --> 49:41.143
- Hi.

49:41.145 --> 49:43.612
- James, Sarah, Rachel, Andy.

49:44.881 --> 49:46.482
- James, Rachel, Andy?

49:46.484 --> 49:47.583
- Rachel, yes.

49:47.585 --> 49:48.517
- Got it.

49:48.519 --> 49:49.418
I'm Matt, nice to meet you.

49:49.420 --> 49:50.519
- Nice to meet you.

49:52.423 --> 49:54.323
- I have to run,
so I'll see you guys later.

49:54.325 --> 49:55.291
- Okay, I'll see you later.

49:55.293 --> 49:56.525
- See you later!

49:56.527 --> 49:57.994
- I have a good one if
nobody else gets it.

49:57.996 --> 49:59.061
- The graveyard.

49:59.063 --> 50:00.396
- Ewww!

50:00.398 --> 50:01.497
- That is bullshit.

50:01.499 --> 50:03.032
- No, that is
absolutely true, in fact

50:03.034 --> 50:05.534
my first kiss was
in a graveyard.

50:05.536 --> 50:07.069
- On whose grave?

50:08.171 --> 50:09.605
- Priscilla sears.

50:09.607 --> 50:11.040
- Okay, I
have a better one,

50:11.042 --> 50:12.908
I have a better one,
I have a better one.

50:12.910 --> 50:14.477
Okay, it wasn't sex, but I did

50:14.479 --> 50:16.445
get a handjob in a
grandfather clock.

50:16.447 --> 50:17.580
- Oh my god.

50:18.515 --> 50:20.049
How is that possible?

50:20.051 --> 50:21.450
- It was a
large grandfather clock.

50:21.452 --> 50:22.651
- A large
grandfather clock.

50:22.653 --> 50:24.153
- It was like
imagine the size...

50:24.155 --> 50:25.321
- can I just tell you
what I'm imagining right now?

50:25.323 --> 50:26.922
- Please, yeah.

50:26.924 --> 50:28.324
- So it's
just like here's this

50:28.326 --> 50:30.292
grandfather clock
and you're inside it?

50:30.294 --> 50:31.227
- Yeah.

50:31.229 --> 50:32.428
- She's just outside it?

50:32.430 --> 50:33.095
- No, we're
both inside it!

50:33.097 --> 50:34.097
I'm a gentleman.

50:35.800 --> 50:38.801
- That's some bullshit.

50:38.803 --> 50:40.369
- Grandfather
clock though.

50:40.371 --> 50:41.771
- Do I win, do I win?

50:41.773 --> 50:43.939
- I don't know,
does grandfather clock.

50:43.941 --> 50:45.541
- Hey, hey, how about her?

50:45.543 --> 50:46.509
- Which one?

50:46.511 --> 50:48.110
- The blonde girl, white shirt.

50:48.112 --> 50:49.612
- Nah, too thing.

50:49.614 --> 50:50.746
- All right.

50:51.948 --> 50:54.016
Oh, oh, what about her?

50:55.085 --> 50:58.554
In the, what you call
them, the jeggings.

50:58.556 --> 50:59.889
- Are you kidding me?

50:59.891 --> 51:01.323
- What?

51:01.325 --> 51:03.492
- Seriously, she's
completely normal.

51:03.494 --> 51:04.660
- That's normal?

51:04.662 --> 51:05.728
- Yeah.

51:05.730 --> 51:06.929
- That's normal?

51:06.931 --> 51:08.431
- Yes it is.

51:08.433 --> 51:11.033
- Okay, maybe back in
Wisconsin with the farm girls...

51:11.035 --> 51:13.002
- dude, I'm from Rhode Island.

51:13.004 --> 51:15.304
- All right, well whatever, man.

51:15.306 --> 51:17.039
You tell me then.

51:17.041 --> 51:19.475
What are we looking for, huh?

51:19.477 --> 51:20.477
What?

51:30.954 --> 51:33.289
- It's so nice, is it
like this every day?

51:33.291 --> 51:34.457
- Yes.

51:34.459 --> 51:37.126
That's why I love it here.

51:44.401 --> 51:45.401
- Thanks.

51:48.472 --> 51:50.940
- Okay, so I have
no way to prove it,

51:50.942 --> 51:52.608
but I'm pretty sure
the mirror in the

51:52.610 --> 51:54.577
bathroom is one
of those two-sided

51:54.579 --> 51:56.112
mirrors you see in cop shows.

51:56.114 --> 51:57.346
- No way.

51:57.348 --> 52:00.082
- Yes, because I
could see a figure.

52:01.785 --> 52:02.651
- Thank you.

52:02.653 --> 52:04.019
You could what?

52:04.821 --> 52:06.088
- What is this?

52:06.090 --> 52:07.090
- Hmm?

52:08.692 --> 52:10.292
- When did you order these?

52:10.294 --> 52:12.995
- While you were
in the restroom.

52:12.997 --> 52:15.131
- I told you I
didn't want dessert.

52:15.133 --> 52:17.333
- Yeah, I know, I just thought

52:17.335 --> 52:18.801
I haven't seen you in a while,

52:18.803 --> 52:20.669
so I thought we
should celebrate.

52:20.671 --> 52:24.206
- Right, but I told
you I didn't want any.

52:24.208 --> 52:26.142
- Oh come on, just have
some ice cream with me.

52:26.144 --> 52:26.976
- I'm good.

52:26.978 --> 52:28.210
- I'm paying.

52:29.346 --> 52:30.379
- I'm good.

52:35.152 --> 52:36.385
- You know that's all I could

52:36.387 --> 52:37.586
think about on the
plane down here?

52:37.588 --> 52:39.088
- What, taking a
baseball bat to the

52:39.090 --> 52:41.123
tiny shred of willpower
I've developed?

52:41.125 --> 52:44.426
- No, just buying
you meals and stuff.

52:46.163 --> 52:47.730
'Cause you always did
the buying before.

52:47.732 --> 52:50.566
- My parents did the buying,
it was their credit card.

52:50.568 --> 52:52.067
- Well I finally
saved up some money

52:52.069 --> 52:54.336
and I've been working
like you wouldn't believe.

52:54.338 --> 52:55.638
I just thought it would be nice

52:55.640 --> 52:56.906
to take you out for a meal and...

52:56.908 --> 52:58.574
- hey, you can pay
for the dinner.

52:58.576 --> 52:59.808
- A salad?

52:59.810 --> 53:01.277
What is that, come
on, that's not a meal.

53:01.279 --> 53:02.945
- It had chicken on
it, that's protein.

53:02.947 --> 53:04.146
That makes it a meal.

53:04.148 --> 53:05.848
- Wow, you actually
just said that.

53:05.850 --> 53:08.317
- What is so horrible
about having a salad?

53:08.319 --> 53:09.552
- Nothing, it's fine.

53:09.554 --> 53:10.686
You know what, don't
eat it, I don't care.

53:10.688 --> 53:11.620
Watch it melt.

53:11.622 --> 53:12.622
- Jill.

53:13.891 --> 53:14.757
- Hi.

53:14.759 --> 53:16.058
- Hi.

53:16.060 --> 53:17.193
How are you?

53:19.729 --> 53:20.663
- Pretty good.

53:20.665 --> 53:22.998
- Yeah, I'd say pretty good.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.333
- Thank you.

53:24.335 --> 53:25.701
Thanks.

53:25.703 --> 53:27.236
- You look great.

53:28.672 --> 53:29.505
- Thank you.

53:29.507 --> 53:30.839
- You look really good.

53:30.841 --> 53:32.741
- Carl, this is
my boyfriend Matt.

53:32.743 --> 53:33.576
- Hi.

53:33.578 --> 53:34.410
- How you doing?

53:34.412 --> 53:35.611
- Nice to meet you.

53:35.613 --> 53:37.513
- So wow, wow.

53:37.515 --> 53:38.447
- Yeah.

53:38.449 --> 53:40.249
- We should get together.

53:40.251 --> 53:42.117
Get some coffee or...

53:43.653 --> 53:44.486
Something.

53:44.488 --> 53:45.654
- Possibly, yeah.

53:45.656 --> 53:46.789
- You got my number?

53:46.791 --> 53:47.623
- I must.

53:47.625 --> 53:48.624
- I want you to call me.

53:48.626 --> 53:49.458
- Okay.

53:49.460 --> 53:50.292
- Okay?

53:50.294 --> 53:51.294
- Okay.

53:53.965 --> 53:55.197
- Wow, you look great.

53:55.199 --> 53:57.733
- Thank you, thanks,
I appreciate that.

53:57.735 --> 53:58.934
- Yeah, okay.

53:58.936 --> 54:00.970
Nice to meet you, mark.

54:20.357 --> 54:21.490
- It's good.

54:21.492 --> 54:22.891
Good ice cream.

54:24.494 --> 54:25.494
Happy?

54:47.684 --> 54:49.118
Oh my god, I cannot

54:49.120 --> 54:50.419
believe that she
looks like that.

54:50.421 --> 54:51.720
I know, I really...

54:51.722 --> 54:52.988
- guys, I'm just

54:52.990 --> 54:54.423
saying her ass is
the size of Texas.

54:54.425 --> 54:56.892
- Well
it's the size.

55:01.264 --> 55:02.931
I'm doing this thing where I eat

55:02.933 --> 55:05.701
cheese and have
a piece of salad.

55:05.703 --> 55:06.902
Then I run...

55:06.904 --> 55:08.170
- I just wanna
burn the calories,

55:08.172 --> 55:09.538
I don't wanna do it,
I don't wanna do it.

55:09.540 --> 55:10.773
Okay, okay, hold on.

55:10.775 --> 55:12.408
So what did he say when
you found the condoms,

55:12.410 --> 55:15.411
or I should say the
dearth of condoms?

55:15.413 --> 55:16.912
They broke up for three
days and when they got

55:16.914 --> 55:19.214
back together, four
of them were missing.

55:19.216 --> 55:20.616
- Woof.

55:20.618 --> 55:21.750
- He said he likes

55:21.752 --> 55:23.018
to jerk off into them.

55:24.422 --> 55:25.621
Please tell me you did

55:25.623 --> 55:26.955
not fuck him after
you got back together.

55:26.957 --> 55:29.825
- I mean I saw him and things...

55:29.827 --> 55:31.627
- All
right, look, we're going

55:31.629 --> 55:33.262
to a party at Bel Air's tonight.

55:33.264 --> 55:34.463
Join us, we'll find you a guy.

55:34.465 --> 55:35.397
- Ben says he

55:35.399 --> 55:36.932
thinks we can make this work.

55:36.934 --> 55:38.667
- Fuck
that psion-driving douche.

55:38.669 --> 55:40.202
You're young and
hot, what the fuck

55:40.204 --> 55:41.837
do you wanna be tied
down to a guy for?

55:41.839 --> 55:43.072
This is college.

55:43.074 --> 55:44.540
- I know, I just...

55:44.542 --> 55:46.842
- all right,
you think you love this guy?

55:46.844 --> 55:48.811
Okay, let's say
he's being honest,

55:48.813 --> 55:51.013
let's say he's turned
over a new leaf and

55:51.015 --> 55:53.716
you guys find a way to
make it work or whatever.

55:53.718 --> 55:55.484
Ask yourself this one question.

55:55.486 --> 55:56.885
Do you really wanna
go the rest of your

55:56.887 --> 55:59.588
life wondering if you
could've done better?

56:21.845 --> 56:23.045
- Hey.

56:23.047 --> 56:24.413
- What's this?

56:24.415 --> 56:25.881
You made dinner?

56:27.650 --> 56:28.650
- Yeah.

56:29.886 --> 56:32.154
It's a special recipe I
picked up at the restaurant.

56:32.156 --> 56:33.689
I figured it's our
last night here,

56:33.691 --> 56:35.891
and we've been eating
out all week, so...

56:35.893 --> 56:38.494
- Uh-huh, and what's in it?

56:38.496 --> 56:39.728
You know I've been...

56:39.730 --> 56:41.330
- well it's gluten
free and dairy free.

56:41.332 --> 56:43.165
It's all appropriate.

56:43.167 --> 56:44.466
- All right.

56:44.468 --> 56:46.001
Let me just take out the trash.

56:46.003 --> 56:46.835
I got it.

56:46.837 --> 56:48.036
- I can get it.

56:48.038 --> 56:49.271
- You made dinner, I'll
take out the trash.

56:49.273 --> 56:50.072
- Jill, come on,
just let me do it.

56:50.074 --> 56:51.206
Really, let me do it.

56:51.208 --> 56:52.441
- No, it's a habit.

56:52.443 --> 56:53.675
Can you not?

56:53.677 --> 56:56.311
- It's the least
I can do, come on.

56:57.781 --> 56:59.047
- Dairy free huh?

56:59.049 --> 57:00.582
- Here, just let me...

57:00.584 --> 57:03.385
- What part of "I'm on a
diet" do you not understand?

57:03.387 --> 57:06.021
Okay, seriously
dude, heavy cream?

57:06.023 --> 57:07.256
Are you kidding me?

57:07.258 --> 57:08.490
- Those are the
ingredients, that's what

57:08.492 --> 57:10.626
goes into it, it's
not a big deal.

57:10.628 --> 57:11.727
- Oh really?

57:11.729 --> 57:12.795
- It's no big deal.

57:12.797 --> 57:13.862
- No big deal, huh?

57:13.864 --> 57:15.063
Okay, do you realize this is one

57:15.065 --> 57:17.166
of the hardest things
I've ever done?

57:17.168 --> 57:18.767
Do you even realize how...

57:18.769 --> 57:20.002
- oh my god, you run around in

57:20.004 --> 57:21.603
circles once a day,
how hard can that be?

57:21.605 --> 57:22.605
- What?

57:25.442 --> 57:28.277
- Hold on, just,
here, just taste it.

57:28.279 --> 57:29.778
Here, just try it, just try it.

57:29.780 --> 57:30.913
Just have a taste.

57:30.915 --> 57:31.847
- Oh my god, no.

57:31.849 --> 57:32.848
- Please, then we'll talk.

57:32.850 --> 57:34.116
- Just try it, just taste it!

57:34.118 --> 57:35.117
- Fuck you!

57:35.119 --> 57:36.119
Seriously!

57:38.421 --> 57:40.656
- Fucking eat it, eat it!

57:53.736 --> 57:55.304
- Jill, hey Jill!

57:56.406 --> 57:57.406
Jill!

58:01.911 --> 58:02.911
Jill!

58:03.646 --> 58:05.047
Jill, Jill, listen!

58:05.049 --> 58:07.249
- Get out of here, go!

58:07.251 --> 58:10.719
- Please just tell me
what you want, Jill!

58:10.721 --> 58:11.954
- What I want?

58:11.956 --> 58:13.789
You want me to tell
you what I want?

58:13.791 --> 58:15.157
I want you to get
your ass on a fucking

58:15.159 --> 58:16.592
plane and go back to
Rhode Island and never

58:16.594 --> 58:20.462
fucking talk to me again,
that's what I want!

58:20.464 --> 58:22.731
- You know, you'll
never be one of them.

58:22.733 --> 58:23.565
- What?

58:23.567 --> 58:24.766
- You know that right?

58:24.768 --> 58:27.069
Even if you wanted to be.

58:27.071 --> 58:29.037
Even if they want you
to be, which they don't.

58:29.039 --> 58:30.973
- Said the guy
with the glass eye!

58:30.975 --> 58:34.443
Oh, my bad, sorry,
"plastic acrylic".

58:34.445 --> 58:35.911
- Hey fuck you!

58:35.913 --> 58:38.013
- You know what, actually, stop
me if you've heard this one.

58:38.015 --> 58:39.715
Some bitch walks up
Winston Churchill at a

58:39.717 --> 58:43.352
party and says Mr.
Churchill, you're drunk.

58:43.354 --> 58:47.122
To which Churchill replies
yes, but in the morning

58:47.124 --> 58:50.526
I'll be sober and
you'll still be ugly.

58:52.061 --> 58:56.298
I keep doing what I'm doing,
and eventually I'll be thin.

58:56.300 --> 59:00.602
And at the end of the day,
you'll still be deformed.

59:02.138 --> 59:04.106
It's a great word, isn't it?

59:04.108 --> 59:05.774
Deformed?

59:05.776 --> 59:07.242
Such a you word.

59:08.611 --> 59:11.547
You know, you'll also
still be an idiot

59:11.549 --> 59:14.383
by the way, I mean wow,
great plan, Patton!

59:14.385 --> 59:16.618
One fatty
meal, 50 pounds

59:16.620 --> 59:19.187
is gonna leap back on me, wow!

59:19.189 --> 59:20.656
- You lied to me.

59:20.658 --> 59:23.325
- I didn't lie to you, I just
didn't tell you about it.

59:23.327 --> 59:24.726
I wanted it to be a surprise.

59:24.728 --> 59:26.929
- That's a lie, that's,
what's the word,

59:26.931 --> 59:29.565
equivocating, which is basically
exactly the same thing!

59:29.567 --> 59:31.567
- Actually no, it's not
because this doesn't

59:31.569 --> 59:33.902
negatively impact you
in any way, okay?

59:33.904 --> 59:35.604
Tell me what's wrong
with what I'm doing.

59:35.606 --> 59:39.174
- 'Cause you're a
fucking fatass, okay?

59:39.176 --> 59:41.944
And I like that about you.

59:41.946 --> 59:43.445
I like that the only
guys I'm competing

59:43.447 --> 59:45.380
against are elderly
degenerates and

59:45.382 --> 59:47.482
guys that sickens me
to think of you with,

59:47.484 --> 59:48.717
but the rest of
the world wouldn't

59:48.719 --> 59:50.085
touch with a 10
foot pole, and you

59:50.087 --> 59:51.186
shouldn't be able to change all

59:51.188 --> 59:53.989
that without fucking telling me!

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:02.931
- You have a beautiful day.

01:00:11.908 --> 01:00:12.908
- Fuck!

01:00:56.919 --> 01:00:57.786
- Hey.

01:00:57.788 --> 01:00:59.421
- Hey.

01:00:59.423 --> 01:01:02.424
- I'm just looking
for a jump rope.

01:01:03.459 --> 01:01:05.394
- They're over there.

01:01:05.396 --> 01:01:06.628
- Oh, thanks.

01:01:21.611 --> 01:01:23.578
Hey, don't I know you?

01:01:25.848 --> 01:01:29.151
I mean were you a student
at Benjamin frank high?

01:01:29.153 --> 01:01:31.620
A transfer student or whatever?

01:01:31.622 --> 01:01:32.921
- Yeah, I was.

01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:36.024
- Yeah.

01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:38.927
Yeah, I helped you with
your books that one time.

01:01:38.929 --> 01:01:40.362
You dropped them.

01:01:40.364 --> 01:01:41.463
- Uh-huh.

01:01:41.465 --> 01:01:42.898
- Yeah.

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:47.035
- After your friends knocked
them out of my hands?

01:01:53.076 --> 01:01:56.211
- So you like working
out down here?

01:01:57.113 --> 01:01:59.314
- It's all right.

01:01:59.316 --> 01:02:00.849
- Yeah.

01:02:00.851 --> 01:02:04.486
I mean it can get pretty busy
upstairs sometimes, you know.

01:02:04.488 --> 01:02:05.887
I've had to wait 10
minutes to get on

01:02:05.889 --> 01:02:08.323
a treadmill before,
it's crazy right?

01:02:08.325 --> 01:02:09.791
- If you say so.

01:02:13.429 --> 01:02:17.566
- Hey, look, I don't know
what your plans are tonight.

01:02:17.568 --> 01:02:18.867
Me and some buddies
were thinking of

01:02:18.869 --> 01:02:21.803
throwing a little party
over the frat house.

01:02:21.805 --> 01:02:23.071
I don't know what you
got going on, but I

01:02:23.073 --> 01:02:26.908
was thinking that maybe
you'd like to join us.

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:28.243
I mean I know we
don't know each other

01:02:28.245 --> 01:02:29.277
very well or
anything, but it could

01:02:29.279 --> 01:02:32.447
be nice to see a familiar face.

01:02:32.449 --> 01:02:33.648
Hey, wait up.

01:02:38.955 --> 01:02:39.955
Just, hey.

01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:42.491
Hey.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:46.828
So which dorm are you in,
O'Malley's, or I mean...

01:02:46.830 --> 01:02:49.431
- don't fucking touch me!

01:02:49.433 --> 01:02:50.732
Okay, whatever it
is you're doing

01:02:50.734 --> 01:02:52.267
you can just stop right now.

01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:53.735
- I'm not, I don't
know what you're...

01:02:53.737 --> 01:02:55.036
- I don't know what
you're up to, and I don't

01:02:55.038 --> 01:02:57.739
wanna find out, so just
leave me the fuck alone.

01:02:57.741 --> 01:03:01.076
- Okay, what makes you think
that I'm up to anything?

01:03:01.078 --> 01:03:03.044
- Is that a joke?

01:03:03.046 --> 01:03:04.479
- No.

01:03:04.481 --> 01:03:05.714
- Some Abercrombie and
Fitch cover boy just strolls

01:03:05.716 --> 01:03:06.915
up to the chubby
girl doing laps in

01:03:06.917 --> 01:03:09.417
the basement and
asks her on a date?

01:03:09.419 --> 01:03:10.786
Yeah, fuck that shit.

01:03:10.788 --> 01:03:14.589
- Whoa, okay, first of
all, it's not a date.

01:03:15.525 --> 01:03:16.525
I mean...

01:03:19.362 --> 01:03:20.762
Okay, I was just asking if you

01:03:20.764 --> 01:03:22.264
wanted to check out
a really cool party.

01:03:22.266 --> 01:03:23.198
- And I said no.

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:24.099
- But why?

01:03:24.101 --> 01:03:25.033
I mean...

01:03:25.035 --> 01:03:26.535
- because I don't want to.

01:03:26.537 --> 01:03:27.702
- That's not an answer though.

01:03:27.704 --> 01:03:29.538
- I don't have to give you one.

01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:30.772
- All right, but
still, don't you

01:03:30.774 --> 01:03:32.741
think it would be the
polite thing to do?

01:03:32.743 --> 01:03:34.009
Just to show a little courtesy

01:03:34.011 --> 01:03:35.477
to a guy who's going
out on a limb here?

01:03:35.479 --> 01:03:37.813
I mean be candor with me and...

01:03:37.815 --> 01:03:40.115
- you want candor, fine.

01:03:40.117 --> 01:03:41.349
You bore me.

01:03:41.351 --> 01:03:42.551
- Okay.

01:03:42.553 --> 01:03:43.752
- From your fucking
pretty boy smile

01:03:43.754 --> 01:03:45.220
to your shoes to your
innermost thoughts

01:03:45.222 --> 01:03:47.489
and feelings, have you
listened to yourself talk?

01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:50.692
"Oh I gotta wait 10 minutes
for a treadmill," come on.

01:03:50.694 --> 01:03:52.027
You know, I guess I just
have better things to

01:03:52.029 --> 01:03:53.829
do on a Friday night
than play beer pong

01:03:53.831 --> 01:03:57.365
with a bunch of date
rapists in training.

01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:00.502
- Wow.

01:04:02.738 --> 01:04:05.941
Yeah, you have got
me all wrong here.

01:04:09.545 --> 01:04:11.413
I'm a nice guy, okay?

01:04:13.716 --> 01:04:15.083
- I don't care.

01:04:19.155 --> 01:04:20.155
- Okay.

01:05:16.145 --> 01:05:18.146
- Hey, it's me.

01:05:18.148 --> 01:05:20.916
Yeah, what are
you doing tonight?

01:05:20.918 --> 01:05:22.083
- Is he going out?

01:05:22.085 --> 01:05:24.019
I don't know where he's going.

01:05:24.021 --> 01:05:27.055
I don't know where he's going.

01:05:27.057 --> 01:05:28.857
Where are you going?

01:05:30.559 --> 01:05:32.928
I said where are you going.

01:05:34.597 --> 01:05:36.431
Hello, am I talking
to a brick wall here?

01:05:36.433 --> 01:05:37.265
Say something.

01:05:37.267 --> 01:05:38.099
- Out, okay?

01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:38.934
I'm going out.

01:05:38.936 --> 01:05:40.402
- Where?

01:05:40.404 --> 01:05:42.904
- Elmo's gonna pick me up,
we're just gonna drive around.

01:05:42.906 --> 01:05:45.807
It's not a big deal, okay?

01:05:45.809 --> 01:05:47.275
Have you seen my
wallet anywhere?

01:05:47.277 --> 01:05:48.310
- One second.

01:05:48.312 --> 01:05:49.544
I'll be right back, honey.

01:05:49.546 --> 01:05:50.546
- Huh?

01:05:52.915 --> 01:05:56.618
- I'd rather you
stay home tonight.

01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:58.820
Look, it sucks what
you're going through.

01:05:58.822 --> 01:06:00.055
I know that, I
know it's the worst

01:06:00.057 --> 01:06:01.256
feeling in the
world and anything

01:06:01.258 --> 01:06:02.524
I say is gonna sound
like...

01:06:02.526 --> 01:06:03.892
- damn it, where's
my fucking wallet?

01:06:03.894 --> 01:06:05.026
- Hey, are you listening to me?

01:06:05.028 --> 01:06:06.494
- Yeah, I'm listening!

01:06:06.496 --> 01:06:07.629
- I'm telling you I think
you should stay home!

01:06:07.631 --> 01:06:08.830
- That was astoundingly
like the advice

01:06:08.832 --> 01:06:09.764
you gave me six
months ago, and look

01:06:09.766 --> 01:06:10.999
where that fucking got me, okay?

01:06:11.001 --> 01:06:12.100
- I'm trying to help you.

01:06:12.102 --> 01:06:13.234
- Help me?

01:06:13.236 --> 01:06:14.602
Are you kidding me?

01:06:14.604 --> 01:06:15.870
You're a single mother looking

01:06:15.872 --> 01:06:17.205
around for her
deadbeat ex-husband

01:06:17.207 --> 01:06:18.506
trying to get child
support, okay,

01:06:18.508 --> 01:06:21.710
so don't help me,
help yourself okay?

01:06:23.245 --> 01:06:24.546
- All right, do what you want.

01:06:24.548 --> 01:06:25.548
I'm done.

01:06:28.184 --> 01:06:29.851
Hey honey.

01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:34.422
- Hey.

01:06:34.424 --> 01:06:35.424
- Hey.

01:06:48.304 --> 01:06:49.804
Oh hey, a letter came for you,

01:06:49.806 --> 01:06:51.573
somebody slipped
it under the door.

01:06:51.575 --> 01:06:54.642
It was on the floor
when I came in.

01:07:26.008 --> 01:07:27.609
- That one
there, that's him.

01:07:27.611 --> 01:07:28.743
Click on it.

01:07:29.678 --> 01:07:30.879
Nice.

01:07:30.881 --> 01:07:32.113
- He's handsome.

01:07:32.115 --> 01:07:35.483
- He's too handsome,
I wouldn't trust him.

01:07:37.086 --> 01:07:39.587
- See, now why
would you say that?

01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:40.755
- Maybe he's a nice guy.

01:07:40.757 --> 01:07:41.990
- Or maybe he really likes her.

01:07:41.992 --> 01:07:43.258
- Based on what, he
doesn't know her.

01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:45.627
- I don't
know, how should I know?

01:07:45.629 --> 01:07:47.062
I'm just saying it's possible.

01:07:47.064 --> 01:07:48.530
- Yeah, you say it's
possible, and it's usually

01:07:48.532 --> 01:07:51.833
not possible, do you even
know what tonight is?

01:07:51.835 --> 01:07:53.968
- What's tonight?

01:07:55.604 --> 01:07:57.338
- It's nothing.

01:07:57.340 --> 01:07:58.273
Never mind.

01:07:58.275 --> 01:08:00.041
- No, tell me, what's tonight?

01:08:00.043 --> 01:08:04.679
- It's nothing, I mean I'm just
saying I wouldn't call him.

01:08:04.681 --> 01:08:06.581
- Is it something...

01:08:06.583 --> 01:08:07.415
- No.

01:08:07.417 --> 01:08:08.683
No, no.

01:08:08.685 --> 01:08:10.118
- Why can't you tell me?

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:13.588
- It's just, it's this
stupid thing fraternities do.

01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:15.890
- All right, well I guess if
it's nothing I can call him.

01:08:15.892 --> 01:08:17.192
- It's just...

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:28.103
Have you ever heard
of the cattle call?

01:08:55.764 --> 01:08:56.598
- What?

01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:57.665
What, what is it?

01:08:57.667 --> 01:08:58.867
What did I do?

01:08:58.868 --> 01:09:01.102
- I don't know, it's...

01:09:01.104 --> 01:09:02.470
I don't feel like
this is necessary.

01:09:02.471 --> 01:09:04.805
- Necessary?

01:09:04.808 --> 01:09:07.008
- Yeah, I mean...

01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:08.977
You're here, I'm here.

01:09:09.778 --> 01:09:10.712
What's the hurry?

01:09:10.714 --> 01:09:12.212
- I'm not in a hurry.

01:09:12.215 --> 01:09:14.549
- Why do you keep doing it?

01:09:14.551 --> 01:09:15.716
I just mean it's like every time

01:09:15.719 --> 01:09:18.386
that we're together
it's always...

01:09:18.388 --> 01:09:20.287
- Because I like you.

01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:23.691
I mean what do you
want me to say?

01:09:23.693 --> 01:09:25.059
- You
don't even know me.

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:26.094
- Yeah I do.

01:09:26.095 --> 01:09:27.228
- Really?

01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:28.863
What do you know about me?

01:09:28.865 --> 01:09:31.099
- Okay, I'm not doing this.

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:33.067
- Okay, fine, I don't care.

01:09:33.069 --> 01:09:34.402
- You're a fucking asshole.

01:09:34.404 --> 01:09:36.871
- No, no I'm not, okay?

01:09:36.872 --> 01:09:40.875
This is the kind of
shit I'm talking about.

01:09:40.877 --> 01:09:42.410
I read.

01:09:42.412 --> 01:09:44.312
I have thoughts, I...

01:09:46.182 --> 01:09:49.117
I have an imagination, I go to

01:09:49.118 --> 01:09:51.586
places that you don't even know.

01:09:51.587 --> 01:09:53.054
I do things for people.

01:09:53.055 --> 01:09:55.490
- Oh my god, you've gotta
be fucking kidding me.

01:09:55.492 --> 01:09:57.058
- Because I care.

01:09:59.695 --> 01:10:02.197
That's the kind of shit
that I want you to want

01:10:02.199 --> 01:10:06.334
me for, that's what I
want you to know about me.

01:10:10.005 --> 01:10:11.573
I'm a decent guy.

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:25.720
Wow.

01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:29.057
You look...

01:10:30.092 --> 01:10:31.092
Wow.

01:10:32.828 --> 01:10:34.262
You ready to go?

01:10:36.799 --> 01:10:37.799
Okay.

01:10:39.435 --> 01:10:40.835
- Okay, you're gonna like them,

01:10:40.837 --> 01:10:42.170
they're super cool,
trust me, it's gonna be,

01:10:42.172 --> 01:10:43.638
how much cash do
you have on you?

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:44.672
- Not a lot, why?

01:10:44.674 --> 01:10:46.174
- Here, just take this.

01:10:46.176 --> 01:10:47.675
Take that.

01:10:47.677 --> 01:10:50.178
All right, the beer is
free, but the liquor costs

01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:51.746
money okay, so when
you offer to buy a girl

01:10:51.748 --> 01:10:54.582
a drink, make sure you
pull out the whole wad.

01:10:54.584 --> 01:10:55.850
Okay, let her see it.

01:10:55.852 --> 01:10:57.151
- Why?

01:10:57.153 --> 01:10:58.620
- So she knows you
have deep pockets.

01:10:58.622 --> 01:11:00.154
- Yeah, but I don't.

01:11:00.156 --> 01:11:02.156
- Right, but she doesn't
even know that, all right?

01:11:02.158 --> 01:11:05.326
They only see what
you want them to see.

01:11:47.936 --> 01:11:49.270
Hey!

01:11:49.272 --> 01:11:52.173
I got someone I
need you to meet!

01:11:54.143 --> 01:11:55.943
Hey, hey, Toni!

01:11:55.945 --> 01:11:59.147
Toni, Toni, this is
Matt, Matt, this is Toni.

01:11:59.149 --> 01:12:02.050
Toni is in my women's studies
class and she's insane.

01:12:02.052 --> 01:12:03.284
- Hi.

01:12:03.286 --> 01:12:04.986
- So what's with
the weird outfit?

01:12:04.988 --> 01:12:06.688
- What, what do you mean?

01:12:06.690 --> 01:12:09.490
- Yeah, sorry, I forgot to
tell him about the theme.

01:12:09.492 --> 01:12:10.525
- What?

01:12:10.527 --> 01:12:11.926
What theme?

01:12:11.928 --> 01:12:13.461
- Boys will be girls night.

01:12:13.463 --> 01:12:14.996
Yeah, I should've told you
man, I'm sorry about that.

01:12:14.998 --> 01:12:16.497
- How come you're
not dressed up?

01:12:16.499 --> 01:12:18.566
- Me, oh, I'm
waiting for someone.

01:12:18.568 --> 01:12:19.400
- Oooo!

01:12:19.402 --> 01:12:20.535
- Shut up, shut up.

01:12:20.537 --> 01:12:22.070
- Who?

01:12:22.072 --> 01:12:24.539
- Just a friend, don't worry
about it, it's gonna be fine.

01:12:24.541 --> 01:12:25.840
- Hey, just...

01:12:26.642 --> 01:12:28.042
Be careful.

01:12:28.044 --> 01:12:30.011
- All right, have fun!

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:33.081
- Hey, I think there's
some extra boas upstairs.

01:12:33.083 --> 01:12:36.384
Come with me, I'll
get you in uniform.

01:12:42.624 --> 01:12:44.892
- 236,
ladies and gentlemen!

01:12:48.298 --> 01:12:49.597
Who we got next?

01:12:49.599 --> 01:12:51.399
Got you, come on up.

01:12:53.469 --> 01:12:55.536
Aww, sweetie, don't
be a sourpuss.

01:12:55.538 --> 01:12:57.338
All right, who's up?

01:13:02.845 --> 01:13:03.845
195, 195!

01:13:07.150 --> 01:13:08.483
- Jill?

01:13:08.485 --> 01:13:09.485
- Huh?

01:13:10.486 --> 01:13:13.855
- Do you want a
beer or something?

01:13:13.857 --> 01:13:14.857
- Yeah.

01:13:17.659 --> 01:13:19.394
- What do you want?

01:13:21.029 --> 01:13:22.397
- I don't care.

01:13:24.566 --> 01:13:25.500
- What is it?

01:13:25.502 --> 01:13:27.034
- For you.

01:13:28.872 --> 01:13:29.872
Let's see.

01:13:31.173 --> 01:13:32.473
- No, that's it.

01:13:32.475 --> 01:13:33.674
No no no.

01:13:33.676 --> 01:13:34.709
No, I don't want
any of that please.

01:13:34.711 --> 01:13:35.643
- Oh yes you do.

01:13:35.645 --> 01:13:36.878
- No, I'm really, I'm all set.

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:38.246
- Hey, just shut up
and let me do it.

01:13:38.248 --> 01:13:39.547
You will look so good,
you've already got

01:13:39.549 --> 01:13:42.517
that semi-feminine
thing going on anyway.

01:13:42.519 --> 01:13:44.886
High cheek bones, you
have big full lips.

01:13:44.888 --> 01:13:46.287
This will be a cinch.

01:13:46.289 --> 01:13:47.722
- No, I don't want that.

01:13:47.724 --> 01:13:48.990
- Just trust me!

01:13:48.992 --> 01:13:51.726
- Listen to me, I said
I don't wanna do that!

01:13:51.728 --> 01:13:53.361
- All right.

01:13:53.363 --> 01:13:56.063
So what do you want to do then?

01:14:10.045 --> 01:14:11.712
- Hey, Justin.

01:14:11.714 --> 01:14:12.613
You made it, man.

01:14:12.615 --> 01:14:14.248
- Hey there, uh...

01:14:15.150 --> 01:14:15.983
- Elmo.

01:14:15.985 --> 01:14:17.218
- Elmo, Elmo.

01:14:18.253 --> 01:14:20.421
- So did you find
the place okay?

01:14:20.423 --> 01:14:23.424
- Yeah, yeah, it was kinda...

01:14:23.426 --> 01:14:25.593
What kind of party did
you say this was again?

01:14:25.595 --> 01:14:28.996
- Oh, it's like a
stupid costume party.

01:14:30.632 --> 01:14:32.099
Normally I wouldn't
be caught dead

01:14:32.101 --> 01:14:35.236
in a place like
this, too many fags.

01:14:36.805 --> 01:14:39.373
But a boatload of theater
chicks though right?

01:14:39.375 --> 01:14:40.608
Tell you what, why don't I grab

01:14:40.610 --> 01:14:43.444
your coat and get
you some goose.

01:14:43.446 --> 01:14:45.446
- You know, I think I'm just,

01:14:45.448 --> 01:14:47.648
I think I'm gonna head out.

01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:51.986
This place is just a little
too wild for my tastes.

01:14:51.988 --> 01:14:54.188
- Oh, yeah, no, I get it.

01:14:55.257 --> 01:14:57.258
Tell you what, get you a drink...

01:14:57.260 --> 01:14:58.092
- it's all right.

01:14:58.094 --> 01:14:59.193
- You sure?

01:14:59.195 --> 01:15:00.962
You all right?
- Yeah, I'll just, yeah.

01:15:00.964 --> 01:15:03.130
- Okay, yeah, drive safe.

01:15:11.874 --> 01:15:13.040
Justin!

01:15:20.582 --> 01:15:22.450
- Hey, do you know
where the bathroom is?

01:15:22.452 --> 01:15:23.918
- Oh shit, it's you.

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:25.419
Patrick Keever huh?

01:15:25.421 --> 01:15:26.621
- What?

01:15:26.623 --> 01:15:28.389
- I heard dude,
he's a fucking stud.

01:15:28.391 --> 01:15:29.524
I'm jealous.

01:15:30.526 --> 01:15:31.993
- Who are you with?

01:15:31.995 --> 01:15:34.228
- Fabio, he's the sexy Latin
dude taking the photos.

01:15:34.230 --> 01:15:35.563
He's got his own
name tattooed on

01:15:35.565 --> 01:15:36.931
his back and he's
already misused the

01:15:36.933 --> 01:15:39.634
word pedantic twice in
conversation tonight.

01:15:39.636 --> 01:15:41.135
But fuck it, he's
on the rowing team

01:15:41.137 --> 01:15:43.838
and he's got biceps
like softballs.

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:45.439
So who gives a shit right?

01:15:45.441 --> 01:15:47.408
But yeah, Patrick.

01:15:47.410 --> 01:15:48.543
You're a lucky girl.

01:15:48.545 --> 01:15:51.078
Got a fun night ahead of you.

01:15:53.215 --> 01:15:55.983
- Look, I gotta talk
to you about something.

01:15:55.985 --> 01:15:57.818
- Why do they all
wear solid black?

01:15:57.820 --> 01:15:59.887
I mean whatever happened
to vertical stripes right?

01:16:02.025 --> 01:16:04.492
- I don't think I can do this.

01:16:04.494 --> 01:16:06.060
- What?

01:16:06.062 --> 01:16:07.862
What are you talking about?

01:16:07.864 --> 01:16:09.630
You're one of my best pledges.

01:16:09.632 --> 01:16:11.098
- Isn't there any other way?

01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:13.100
- You wanna leave, no one's
forcing you to be here.

01:16:13.102 --> 01:16:14.569
- No, I know, it's just...

01:16:14.571 --> 01:16:16.237
- more importantly, no one's
forcing her to be here.

01:16:16.239 --> 01:16:18.306
She's not stupid, she
knows what's going on.

01:16:18.308 --> 01:16:20.107
Why do you think she
hasn't stormed out by now?

01:16:20.109 --> 01:16:23.244
Why haven't all of
them stormed out?

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:26.814
- I don't know.

01:16:26.816 --> 01:16:29.951
- Because they wanna fuck a
bunch of good looking dudes.

01:16:29.953 --> 01:16:31.719
Are we exploiting them?

01:16:31.721 --> 01:16:33.187
Obviously.

01:16:33.189 --> 01:16:35.389
Are they exploiting
us right back?

01:16:35.391 --> 01:16:36.624
You better believe it.

01:16:36.626 --> 01:16:37.626
- Cheers.

01:16:41.163 --> 01:16:43.898
- I'm not gonna fuck you.

01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:45.733
- Wow, that's a relief.

01:16:45.735 --> 01:16:48.903
- I'm just saying,
you're not my type.

01:16:48.905 --> 01:16:51.706
I figured we should get that
out of the way up front.

01:16:51.708 --> 01:16:54.575
- Up front, you mean like
after I pay for your drink?

01:16:54.577 --> 01:16:56.043
- It's nothing personal.

01:16:56.045 --> 01:16:57.678
You're just too...

01:16:58.914 --> 01:17:00.314
Normal.

01:17:00.316 --> 01:17:01.316
- Normal.

01:17:02.517 --> 01:17:03.718
Oh god, okay.

01:17:04.753 --> 01:17:06.821
Of course, of course
that's the reason.

01:17:06.823 --> 01:17:07.823
- What?

01:17:16.198 --> 01:17:17.198
Whoa.

01:17:19.701 --> 01:17:22.336
- You want different,
huh, you want weird?

01:17:22.338 --> 01:17:24.005
There you go, it's all yours.

01:17:24.007 --> 01:17:25.940
You know what, the funny
thing is I actually

01:17:25.942 --> 01:17:27.942
don't disagree with
you, I really don't.

01:17:27.944 --> 01:17:29.410
I don't care what
the fuck you call me.

01:17:29.412 --> 01:17:30.978
I just wish that you
guys, all you guys

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:33.047
would just get together
and agree on it

01:17:33.049 --> 01:17:35.316
'cause I don't know
what the fuck I am.

01:17:35.318 --> 01:17:38.386
And all these guys,
they seem to know.

01:17:38.388 --> 01:17:39.787
I mean they're here, they put on

01:17:39.789 --> 01:17:41.222
this little uniform,
and the only

01:17:41.224 --> 01:17:42.923
reason I don't have
mine on is because

01:17:42.925 --> 01:17:45.393
this thing doesn't,
it doesn't fit me.

01:17:45.395 --> 01:17:46.627
And if it did, if
there was something

01:17:46.629 --> 01:17:49.930
I could wear or
say or do, then...

01:17:49.932 --> 01:17:53.467
Are you even listening
to me right now?

01:17:53.469 --> 01:17:55.736
I'm saying something to you.

01:17:55.738 --> 01:17:58.172
- Shit, that is so fucking cool.

01:17:58.174 --> 01:17:59.140
- Unbelievable.

01:17:59.142 --> 01:18:00.141
- No, how did it happen?

01:18:00.143 --> 01:18:01.075
You gotta tell me.

01:18:01.077 --> 01:18:02.576
Actually wait, before you start.

01:18:02.578 --> 01:18:03.878
Hey Andy!

01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:05.813
Get over here, you've
gotta see this!

01:18:05.815 --> 01:18:06.815
- 204...

01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:11.152
205, ladies and gentlemen, 205!

01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:16.123
All right, last up.

01:18:17.626 --> 01:18:19.493
Hey tons of fun, come on.

01:18:19.495 --> 01:18:21.629
Come on sweetie, it'll just
take a second, let's go.

01:18:21.631 --> 01:18:23.831
- Don't fucking touch me.

01:18:25.333 --> 01:18:26.500
- Come on, it's not gonna hurt.

01:18:26.502 --> 01:18:27.334
Just get up.

01:18:27.336 --> 01:18:28.269
- I said I didn't...

01:18:28.271 --> 01:18:29.203
- just get on the scale.

01:18:29.205 --> 01:18:30.404
- I'm not doing this, I don't...

01:18:30.406 --> 01:18:32.773
- get your fucking
hands off her!

01:18:32.775 --> 01:18:33.607
You okay?

01:18:33.609 --> 01:18:34.809
- Yeah.

01:18:34.811 --> 01:18:36.077
- Dude, what the
fuck are you doing?

01:18:36.079 --> 01:18:37.578
I was just taking
her on the scale.

01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:39.513
- She doesn't wanna get on the
scale, so do not touch her!

01:18:39.515 --> 01:18:41.248
- She doesn't wanna
get on the scale?

01:18:41.250 --> 01:18:42.883
What are you, her
bodyguard all of a sudden?

01:18:42.885 --> 01:18:44.518
- What's going on?

01:18:45.554 --> 01:18:47.254
- She doesn't wanna
get on the scale.

01:18:47.256 --> 01:18:48.422
- So?

01:18:48.424 --> 01:18:50.491
- So everyone else
has, so she has to now.

01:18:50.493 --> 01:18:52.460
- She doesn't have to do
anything she doesn't wanna do.

01:18:52.462 --> 01:18:54.628
This is supposed to be fun.

01:18:54.630 --> 01:18:55.896
- Yeah, but
everyone else has...

01:18:55.898 --> 01:18:57.732
- I don't give a shit
about everyone else.

01:18:57.734 --> 01:19:00.367
Only person I care about is...

01:19:01.136 --> 01:19:01.969
What's your name?

01:19:01.971 --> 01:19:03.437
- Jill.

01:19:03.439 --> 01:19:05.005
- Beautiful name.

01:19:07.075 --> 01:19:08.709
All that's important
is that you have

01:19:08.711 --> 01:19:12.012
a good time, isn't
that right Patrick?

01:19:13.281 --> 01:19:14.281
- Yeah.

01:19:15.283 --> 01:19:16.317
- Upstairs.

01:19:19.821 --> 01:19:21.789
Last door on the left.

01:19:23.024 --> 01:19:24.925
- How did you know I played
basketball back then?

01:19:24.927 --> 01:19:28.095
- Well we went to the
same high school remember?

01:19:28.097 --> 01:19:29.964
- You went to Ben frank?

01:19:29.966 --> 01:19:30.966
- Yeah.

01:19:34.002 --> 01:19:35.136
Don't you remember
there was that

01:19:35.138 --> 01:19:36.971
one time we were in the hallway,

01:19:36.973 --> 01:19:39.140
I was looking at the
college placement board,

01:19:39.142 --> 01:19:42.176
and you came up and I was like

01:19:42.178 --> 01:19:43.944
hey look, we're going
to the same school

01:19:43.946 --> 01:19:47.248
and you said nice,
I'll see you there.

01:19:54.557 --> 01:19:56.524
You want another beer?

01:20:37.999 --> 01:20:39.300
- No, that...

01:20:39.302 --> 01:20:40.534
- Who is she?

01:20:41.770 --> 01:20:43.904
- She's, we were dating.

01:20:47.042 --> 01:20:50.411
- Were dating, as in
you guys broke up?

01:20:54.082 --> 01:20:55.382
- Not exactly.

01:20:57.586 --> 01:20:58.586
- Right.

01:20:59.487 --> 01:21:00.621
Not exactly.

01:21:03.825 --> 01:21:06.627
How long have you been together?

01:21:07.896 --> 01:21:09.530
- Year and a half.

01:21:10.532 --> 01:21:14.101
We were trying the whole
long distance thing.

01:21:14.103 --> 01:21:15.102
- Oh really?

01:21:15.104 --> 01:21:17.805
How's that working out for you?

01:21:22.077 --> 01:21:23.711
That was another joke.

01:21:23.713 --> 01:21:25.012
- Right, yeah.

01:21:46.935 --> 01:21:48.269
- Oh god.

01:21:50.206 --> 01:21:52.106
I'm such a shitty singer.

01:21:52.108 --> 01:21:53.841
- Oh fuck, were
you even listening?

01:21:53.843 --> 01:21:55.509
Come on man, no, you're good.
- You got a good voice.

01:21:55.511 --> 01:21:57.678
- No, no, shut up, that's wrong.

01:21:57.680 --> 01:21:59.046
- Fuck that, it's true.

01:21:59.048 --> 01:22:01.415
- No man, it's not, I'm
not gonna.

01:22:01.417 --> 01:22:02.650
- Oh come on.

01:22:03.585 --> 01:22:05.552
- Watch it, jeez.

01:22:05.554 --> 01:22:06.620
Outta here.

01:22:26.441 --> 01:22:27.474
Roker, huh?

01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:31.578
You read him yet, he's good.

01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:33.213
He's kinda like...

01:22:34.749 --> 01:22:36.216
What's his name?

01:22:38.486 --> 01:22:39.486
Whatever.

01:22:43.925 --> 01:22:47.127
There was this poet
that my dad knew,

01:22:48.229 --> 01:22:50.664
or knew someone
who, I don't know,

01:22:50.666 --> 01:22:53.901
but this guy, he
was like, not famous

01:22:56.137 --> 01:22:59.707
or anything, he was
just unbearably ugly.

01:23:02.277 --> 01:23:03.510
Like hideous.

01:23:06.915 --> 01:23:10.217
And no woman would
touch him, so he...

01:23:16.891 --> 01:23:18.192
He tried guys.

01:23:25.100 --> 01:23:27.234
No guys would touch him.

01:23:31.906 --> 01:23:34.174
So he tried hookers.

01:23:47.122 --> 01:23:50.591
But none of them would
touch him either.

01:23:51.426 --> 01:23:53.127
- Take off your pants.

01:23:53.129 --> 01:23:56.296
- Don't you wanna just
wait a little bit?

01:23:56.298 --> 01:23:57.364
- For what?

01:23:59.034 --> 01:24:00.634
- I don't know, just...

01:24:00.636 --> 01:24:03.103
- Just take them off.

01:24:03.105 --> 01:24:06.040
- Okay, just give me a minute.

01:24:06.042 --> 01:24:09.176
- So one day he
went out to a store.

01:24:16.651 --> 01:24:20.054
He bought one of those
plastic revolvers.

01:24:23.558 --> 01:24:25.726
And he took the
little orange tip off,

01:24:25.728 --> 01:24:29.096
the one that makes
you know it's a toy.

01:24:31.433 --> 01:24:35.135
And he ran out into
traffic just waving it.

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:41.475
And the police came
out and tackled him

01:24:41.477 --> 01:24:43.110
and threw him on
the hood of the car.

01:24:43.112 --> 01:24:44.845
- Is everything okay?

01:24:44.847 --> 01:24:46.814
- Just a second, okay?

01:24:50.085 --> 01:24:51.718
- I can help with something...

01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:55.289
- no, I just, just
give me a minute okay?

01:25:01.763 --> 01:25:04.231
- He said it felt wonderful.

01:25:06.267 --> 01:25:08.402
Fuck, what was his name?

01:25:12.574 --> 01:25:13.574
Justin?

01:25:16.478 --> 01:25:17.478
Justin?

01:25:18.613 --> 01:25:20.347
Yo dude, you awake?

01:25:23.718 --> 01:25:26.353
- So still too normal to fuck?

01:25:28.556 --> 01:25:29.556
- No.

01:25:30.391 --> 01:25:31.458
Not normal.

01:25:32.961 --> 01:25:33.961
Just...

01:25:36.865 --> 01:25:37.865
Pathetic.

01:25:47.242 --> 01:25:48.242
- Fucker.

01:26:16.538 --> 01:26:17.538
- Hey.

01:26:19.607 --> 01:26:22.242
Have a good night, sweetheart.

01:27:50.632 --> 01:27:51.632
- Hey.

01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:54.067
Wait, no no, hey, no, I'm sorry,

01:27:54.069 --> 01:27:55.902
I thought you knew,
I thought, you were

01:27:55.904 --> 01:27:59.506
touching me, I just
thought that you knew.

01:27:59.508 --> 01:28:02.009
Oh god, please don't hate me.

01:28:02.810 --> 01:28:03.844
I love you.

01:28:23.364 --> 01:28:24.765
- Hello?

01:28:26.367 --> 01:28:27.567
What?

01:28:50.191 --> 01:28:51.258
- This way?

01:28:53.227 --> 01:28:56.229
Hi, hey, excuse me,
can you help me?

01:28:56.231 --> 01:28:57.731
Excuse me?

01:28:57.733 --> 01:28:58.733
Shit.

01:28:59.701 --> 01:29:00.667
Excuse me!

01:29:00.669 --> 01:29:01.768
Excuse me!

01:29:01.770 --> 01:29:02.703
- Sir?

01:29:02.705 --> 01:29:03.904
- Hi, I have a friend here,

01:29:03.906 --> 01:29:04.838
can you tell me
where exactly he is?

01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:06.039
- All right, I understand.

01:29:06.041 --> 01:29:07.307
I'll be with you in
just a second, for right

01:29:07.309 --> 01:29:09.609
now though, please stand
behind the yellow line.

01:29:09.611 --> 01:29:10.844
- No no no, you don't
understand, please,

01:29:10.846 --> 01:29:12.446
can you just tell me
which room he's in and...

01:29:12.448 --> 01:29:14.381
- sir, behind the
yellow line now.

01:29:14.383 --> 01:29:15.315
- Please, just...

01:29:15.317 --> 01:29:16.483
- I'm so sorry.

01:29:16.485 --> 01:29:17.784
- God, get off the
fucking phone, help me!

01:29:17.786 --> 01:29:19.286
- Security!

01:29:19.288 --> 01:29:21.788
- Okay, okay, okay, no,
it's fine, I'm over here.

01:29:21.790 --> 01:29:22.823
- Just sit.

01:29:27.662 --> 01:29:28.662
- Fuck.

01:29:56.457 --> 01:29:58.725
- Elmo moss?

01:29:58.727 --> 01:30:03.029
- He's
in critical care,
please take a seat.

01:30:38.332 --> 01:30:39.633
- How are you?

01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:44.971
Did you take a red eye, or how...

01:30:44.973 --> 01:30:49.176
- look, just do me a favor
and don't talk to me.

01:30:49.178 --> 01:30:51.077
- Do you want me to
sit somewhere else?

01:30:51.079 --> 01:30:52.345
- I don't care.

01:30:52.347 --> 01:30:53.480
- You don't
care, or you...

01:30:53.482 --> 01:30:54.314
- just don't talk to me.

01:30:54.316 --> 01:30:55.148
- Okay.

01:30:55.150 --> 01:30:55.982
- Don't talk...

01:30:55.984 --> 01:30:56.984
- okay.
